(Guo Xiaoyu 2,

28
00:01:57,470 --> 00:01:59,470
I still want to resolve this
in a lawyer's way.

29
00:02:00,071 --> 00:02:00,671
Like what?

30
00:02:02,550 --> 00:02:03,990
Like handling the Warm Nest case.

31
00:02:04,591 --> 00:02:05,910
Only by staying in the program

32
00:02:06,550 --> 00:02:08,070
can I fight for what should be mine.

33
00:02:08,510 --> 00:02:10,070
I've considered your proposal.

34
00:02:10,311 --> 00:02:11,230
It's all reasonable.

35
00:02:11,311 --> 00:02:13,431
But without actual money on the table,

36
00:02:13,670 --> 00:02:14,910
who'd be willing to compromise?

37
00:02:16,510 --> 00:02:18,551
The biggest issue
for Warm Nest now is cash flow.

38
00:02:19,350 --> 00:02:20,350
Once he secures cash flow

39
00:02:20,350 --> 00:02:22,151
and pays both landlords and tenants,

40
00:02:22,510 --> 00:02:23,711
all problems will be solved.

41
00:02:24,630 --> 00:02:25,510
You mean

42
00:02:26,230 --> 00:02:26,871
financing?

43
00:02:30,311 --> 00:02:32,230
That concludes my current proposal.

44
00:02:32,750 --> 00:02:33,831
Please provide feedback.

45
00:02:40,950 --> 00:02:43,391
Jiang Chen, someone submitted

46
00:02:43,391 --> 00:02:44,871
a proposal regarding financing

47
00:02:44,871 --> 00:02:45,750
to us earlier.

48
00:02:46,230 --> 00:02:47,871
Even analyzed the affected tenants.

49
00:02:48,151 --> 00:02:48,831
More detailed.

50
00:03:08,510 --> 00:03:09,311
You're something.

51
00:03:12,790 --> 00:03:14,991
Stealing my idea like that?

52
00:03:15,591 --> 00:03:16,350
I beat you

53
00:03:16,431 --> 00:03:17,431
not through your ideas,

54
00:03:18,031 --> 00:03:19,790
but through the wealth of my data

55
00:03:19,790 --> 00:03:21,350
and my comprehensive analysis.

56
00:03:21,950 --> 00:03:23,871
Clients don't want
lawyers' theoretical ideas.

57
00:03:23,910 --> 00:03:24,630
They want

58
00:03:24,630 --> 00:03:26,271
concrete solutions that actually work.

59
00:03:27,991 --> 00:03:28,680
Alright.

60
00:03:30,350 --> 00:03:31,230
Very educational.

61
00:03:37,271 --> 00:03:39,350
I appreciate you shielding me that day,

62
00:03:40,391 --> 00:03:41,591
but this is a competition.

63
00:03:42,311 --> 00:03:43,070
I want to win.

64
00:03:46,630 --> 00:03:48,470
Your speech this noon moved me too.

65
00:03:49,070 --> 00:03:50,991
I truly value idealism in my heart.

66
00:03:52,630 --> 00:03:53,750
My father is like that.

67
00:03:55,070 --> 00:03:57,391
But it's a luxury
I can't afford right now.

68
00:03:58,311 --> 00:03:59,991
Sometimes you're not wrong,

69
00:04:00,790 --> 00:04:02,670
but you might not be able
to defend yourself.

70
00:04:03,470 --> 00:04:04,750
I've been through that before.

71
00:04:04,950 --> 00:04:06,350
You'd better not take that risk.

72
00:04:08,591 --> 00:04:10,230
I've already contacted Liang Xiaosong.

73
00:04:10,790 --> 00:04:12,190
I'll meet him after work.

74
00:04:12,551 --> 00:04:13,311
Why?

75
00:04:15,350 --> 00:04:16,751
Want to apologize to him for me?

76
00:04:17,711 --> 00:04:19,470
You think I'm not bowing to apologize

77
00:04:19,470 --> 00:04:20,151
because of

78
00:04:20,951 --> 00:04:21,711
my pride?

79
00:04:22,191 --> 00:04:22,831
My ego?

80
00:04:23,910 --> 00:04:24,951
This is my principle.

81
00:04:24,951 --> 00:04:26,071
Could you respect that?

82
00:04:26,071 --> 00:04:27,790
What gives you
the right to decide for me?

83
00:04:28,031 --> 00:04:29,310
Because I'm also involved.

84
00:04:29,831 --> 00:04:31,470
I was the first to go to the Warm Nest.

85
00:04:31,951 --> 00:04:32,870
Because this Weibo post

86
00:04:32,870 --> 00:04:34,470
only had 400-500 reposts this morning,

87
00:04:34,470 --> 00:04:35,790
but it's surpassed 10,000 now.

88
00:04:36,230 --> 00:04:37,751
My photos have been dug up

89
00:04:37,751 --> 00:04:38,550
and posted below.

90
00:04:39,350 --> 00:04:40,350
Because similar things

91
00:04:40,350 --> 00:04:41,430
happened to me

92
00:04:41,430 --> 00:04:42,711
when I first joined Jun An.

93
00:04:42,951 --> 00:04:44,790
I know netizens just want drama.

94
00:04:44,951 --> 00:04:46,910
No one truly cares about the truth.

95
00:05:43,151 --> 00:05:43,831
Everyone,

96
00:05:43,831 --> 00:05:44,831
it's exactly 9 PM.

97
00:05:45,151 --> 00:05:46,631
The final hour countdown starts.

98
00:05:47,071 --> 00:05:48,230
Submit your final proposals

99
00:05:48,230 --> 00:05:49,151
on time.

100
00:05:50,031 --> 00:05:50,711
One minute late,

101
00:05:51,350 --> 00:05:52,031
it's invalidated.

102
00:05:59,336 --> 00:06:02,470
(11 Hours Ago)

103
00:06:02,470 --> 00:06:03,391
You can form teams,

104
00:06:04,031 --> 00:06:04,670
meaning

105
00:06:04,951 --> 00:06:07,790
points reflect battles between groups

106
00:06:08,191 --> 00:06:09,271
and inside them.

107
00:06:10,310 --> 00:06:11,350
So that means

108
00:06:11,391 --> 00:06:13,391
I need both my group to win

109
00:06:13,751 --> 00:06:16,271
and my performance to be top in my group

110
00:06:16,470 --> 00:06:17,550
for high scores.

111
00:06:17,870 --> 00:06:18,472
Exactly.

112
00:06:19,790 --> 00:06:21,391
Don't you want to work with top lawyers?

113
00:06:22,151 --> 00:06:22,870
Rare chance.

114
00:06:23,230 --> 00:06:24,631
Show your best moves now.

115
00:06:27,452 --> 00:06:29,990
(Guo Xiaoyu's Choice)

116
00:06:29,990 --> 00:06:31,110
Jiang Chen, come here.

117
00:06:36,392 --> 00:06:37,990
(Not replying to me again?)

118
00:06:37,990 --> 00:06:38,951
(I thought we made up.)

119
00:06:39,191 --> 00:06:41,831
(Zhubao, I'm feeling down.)

120
00:06:43,071 --> 00:06:44,790
(What's wrong? Are you sick?)

121
00:06:45,928 --> 00:06:48,391
(No. Just under a lot of pressure.)

122
00:06:48,392 --> 00:06:49,896
(I ranked last last time.)

123
00:06:50,888 --> 00:06:52,712
(This round seems risky.)

124
00:06:53,672 --> 00:06:55,670
(Xiaoyu, why not come back?)

125
00:06:55,951 --> 00:06:57,271
(Seeing you like this hurts me.)

126
00:06:57,511 --> 00:06:58,711
(We've been apart too long.)

127
00:06:58,951 --> 00:07:00,230
(Things will change.)

128
00:07:01,352 --> 00:07:03,310
(Zhubao, are you afraid)

129
00:07:03,310 --> 00:07:05,071
(I'll fall for other guys?)

130
00:07:05,928 --> 00:07:07,071
(Yes.)

131
00:07:07,112 --> 00:07:08,670
(I have persecutory delusions.)

132
00:07:11,803 --> 00:07:13,160
(Affected Tenant Data)

134

(Guo Xiaoyu)

135
00:07:27,515 --> 00:07:31,176
(Busy now. Talk later, babe.)

136
00:07:33,191 --> 00:07:33,711
Come in.

137
00:07:35,711 --> 00:07:36,392
Please.

138
00:07:39,430 --> 00:07:40,031
What's up?

139
00:07:41,951 --> 00:07:42,632
Jiatong.

140
00:07:43,071 --> 00:07:44,790
I totally agree with what you said

141
00:07:45,110 --> 00:07:46,071
last night.

142
00:07:46,631 --> 00:07:48,031
If we don't settle this dispute,

143
00:07:48,071 --> 00:07:49,831
we'll never get our money back.

144
00:07:50,110 --> 00:07:50,631
So...

145
00:07:52,511 --> 00:07:54,391
I've carefully analyzed the situation.

146
00:07:54,790 --> 00:07:56,310
You have a settlement plan now,

147
00:07:56,711 --> 00:07:58,151
and I've been organizing

148
00:07:58,151 --> 00:07:58,951
the victim profiles.

149
00:08:00,391 --> 00:08:00,990
How about

150
00:08:01,670 --> 00:08:02,831
we team up to tackle this?

151
00:08:04,310 --> 00:08:05,670
Don't you want to beat Jiang Chen?

152
00:08:05,870 --> 00:08:06,790
This round, you will.

153
00:08:08,670 --> 00:08:10,751
Guiding negotiations

154
00:08:10,751 --> 00:08:12,110
to favor your terms

155
00:08:12,110 --> 00:08:14,230
while making them
feel you're on their side.

156
00:08:14,670 --> 00:08:16,031
Good for you, Guo Xiaoyu.

157
00:08:16,191 --> 00:08:18,230
You've been applying
your idol Mr. Song's methods

158
00:08:18,230 --> 00:08:19,511
better and better lately.

159
00:08:20,110 --> 00:08:22,151
Even the slowest student can improve

160
00:08:22,151 --> 00:08:23,110
with a good mentor.

161
00:08:23,591 --> 00:08:24,831
Mr. Song is my main mentor,

162
00:08:25,230 --> 00:08:27,191
and Jiatong, you're my secondary coach.

163
00:08:28,511 --> 00:08:29,951
Let's form a team.

164
00:08:30,910 --> 00:08:32,271
It's not just for your sake.

165
00:08:33,231 --> 00:08:34,111
I benefit too.

166
00:08:34,430 --> 00:08:35,670
Like you said,

167
00:08:35,790 --> 00:08:36,471
can't there be

168
00:08:36,471 --> 00:08:38,111
a win-win solution?

169
00:08:38,751 --> 00:08:40,631
I absolutely can't be last this round.

170
00:08:41,070 --> 00:08:43,031
Even if my pride were made of steel,

171
00:08:43,271 --> 00:08:43,790
it couldn't

172
00:08:43,790 --> 00:08:45,751
stand being trampled on over and over.

173
00:08:46,991 --> 00:08:47,830
We won't be last.

174
00:08:49,511 --> 00:08:50,351
This round,

175
00:08:50,871 --> 00:08:51,751
we'll be the top.

176
00:08:59,511 --> 00:09:01,190
When I first joined Jun An,

177
00:09:01,190 --> 00:09:02,710
I was anxious every day.

178
00:09:03,631 --> 00:09:05,830
After studying so hard in college,

179
00:09:06,151 --> 00:09:07,511
I couldn't do anything practical.

180
00:09:08,111 --> 00:09:09,830
But today, I'm thrilled

181
00:09:10,391 --> 00:09:11,430
because Jiatong said

182
00:09:11,430 --> 00:09:12,871
my materials were super useful.

183
00:09:13,830 --> 00:09:15,550
We're sure to win this time

184
00:09:15,790 --> 00:09:16,830
and help everyone else.

185
00:09:17,271 --> 00:09:18,511
Don't celebrate yet.

186
00:09:18,751 --> 00:09:19,710
Wait for the results.

187
00:09:22,111 --> 00:09:23,151
Zhubao, remember

188
00:09:23,151 --> 00:09:24,151
my junior mentor?

189
00:09:25,031 --> 00:09:25,790
He broke up...

190
00:09:26,471 --> 00:09:28,271
with his girlfriend of seven years

191
00:09:28,271 --> 00:09:30,031
over a work issue

192
00:09:30,271 --> 00:09:31,070
at Jun An.

193
00:09:31,631 --> 00:09:34,231
Once when you made me mad,

194
00:09:34,550 --> 00:09:36,391
you played a piggy to cheer me up.

195
00:09:36,391 --> 00:09:37,111
It worked well.

196
00:09:37,670 --> 00:09:39,430
So I'll copy your idea

197
00:09:39,991 --> 00:09:41,910
to help him win his girlfriend back.

198
00:09:43,790 --> 00:09:44,310
Xiaoyu.

199
00:09:45,471 --> 00:09:45,991
For you,

200
00:09:46,910 --> 00:09:48,031
does work come before me?

201
00:09:49,710 --> 00:09:50,790
Would you abandon me

202
00:09:51,231 --> 00:09:51,830
for your job?

203
00:09:52,231 --> 00:09:53,231
Or quit your job

204
00:09:53,950 --> 00:09:54,631
for me?

205
00:09:55,271 --> 00:09:57,751
Zhubao, why drag us into this?

206
00:09:58,590 --> 00:09:59,790
It's not the same situation.

207
00:10:00,271 --> 00:10:01,391
How is it different?

208
00:10:02,031 --> 00:10:02,670
Xiaoyu.

209
00:10:03,111 --> 00:10:04,111
I really don't get

210
00:10:04,830 --> 00:10:06,511
why you're so obsessed with this job.

211
00:10:06,511 --> 00:10:07,471
What's the point?

212
00:10:08,070 --> 00:10:09,190
I'm already swamped,

213
00:10:09,631 --> 00:10:10,710
but you're even busier now.

214
00:10:11,590 --> 00:10:13,231
We barely have time to talk anymore.

215
00:10:13,471 --> 00:10:14,511
If this continues,

216
00:10:14,590 --> 00:10:16,031
how long do you think we'll last?

217
00:10:18,871 --> 00:10:19,471
What is that?

218
00:10:19,471 --> 00:10:20,710
You don't love me anymore?

219
00:10:23,710 --> 00:10:24,271
It's noon.

220
00:10:24,751 --> 00:10:25,430
I need to rest.

221
00:10:25,910 --> 00:10:26,511
Talk later.

222
00:10:29,830 --> 00:10:30,830
You hung up on me again.

223
00:10:34,511 --> 00:10:35,670
Why so many forms?

224
00:10:36,190 --> 00:10:38,190
These are information sheets
from the tenants

225
00:10:38,190 --> 00:10:39,430
I contacted.

226
00:10:44,471 --> 00:10:45,710
Can I join your group?

227
00:10:46,231 --> 00:10:47,031
I can code

228
00:10:47,271 --> 00:10:49,471
and create a database
to process info faster.

229
00:10:50,031 --> 00:10:51,271
About what happened before,

230
00:10:51,950 --> 00:10:52,670
I'm sorry.

231
00:10:53,790 --> 00:10:55,391
I genuinely want to help you this time,

232
00:10:56,231 --> 00:10:57,271
and help myself too.

233
00:11:06,391 --> 00:11:06,984
Here.

234
00:11:07,430 --> 00:11:08,008
Thank you.

235
00:11:08,151 --> 00:11:08,871
Busy all morning.

236
00:11:08,910 --> 00:11:10,070
I'm feeling hypoglycemic.

237
00:11:13,751 --> 00:11:15,631
Guo Xiaoyu, do you
even know confidentiality?

238
00:11:15,790 --> 00:11:17,151
Our first-day training.

239
00:11:18,871 --> 00:11:20,471
Jiatong, don't blame Xiaoyu.

240
00:11:20,751 --> 00:11:22,231
Actually, I want to join your team.

241
00:11:23,310 --> 00:11:26,031
To be honest, I don't have
a better plan right now.

242
00:11:26,391 --> 00:11:27,670
But I don't want to lose.

243
00:11:28,910 --> 00:11:29,830
I'll step out first.

244
00:11:30,031 --> 00:11:30,830
You two can talk.

245
00:11:31,070 --> 00:11:32,830
I'll accept whatever outcome.

246
00:11:44,271 --> 00:11:45,751
Have you forgotten what happened?

247
00:11:47,151 --> 00:11:48,511
Jiatong, don't be mad.

248
00:11:49,070 --> 00:11:51,231
Huang Yue's database
is genuinely well-made.

249
00:11:51,751 --> 00:11:53,391
She's already apologized to me.

250
00:11:53,670 --> 00:11:55,430
I really think she can help us.

251
00:11:55,871 --> 00:11:57,710
Let's team up
for this round of assessment.

252
00:11:58,991 --> 00:12:00,151
If a teammate makes an error,

253
00:12:00,151 --> 00:12:01,910
our chances of elimination increase.

254
00:12:02,190 --> 00:12:03,511
More people mean higher risks.

255
00:12:05,151 --> 00:12:05,800
Xiaoyu.

256
00:12:06,351 --> 00:12:08,590
The first lesson I learned
at my previous firm was

257
00:12:08,830 --> 00:12:10,550
that no matter
how close to your comrades,

258
00:12:10,910 --> 00:12:12,391
never expose your back to them.

259
00:12:13,430 --> 00:12:14,550
This lesson's free for you.

260
00:12:16,550 --> 00:12:17,471
What about us?

261
00:12:20,070 --> 00:12:22,111
I contributed to this plan too, right?

262
00:12:22,111 --> 00:12:24,190
Shouldn't I have
some decision-making power?

263
00:12:24,830 --> 00:12:27,151
I'm not stupid. I know
the assessment is crucial.

264
00:12:27,550 --> 00:12:28,830
But I don't think

265
00:12:29,031 --> 00:12:30,910
competitors have to be enemies.

266
00:12:32,190 --> 00:12:33,471
I don't know what you all think,

267
00:12:33,751 --> 00:12:35,790
but since coming to Jun An this time,

268
00:12:35,790 --> 00:12:36,830
one of my biggest gains

269
00:12:38,031 --> 00:12:38,751
has been you guys.

270
00:13:07,035 --> 00:13:12,584
(Warm Nest Victim Information Form)

271
00:13:38,271 --> 00:13:39,190
We have two proposals.

272
00:13:39,190 --> 00:13:40,871
First, rent reduction.

273
00:13:40,871 --> 00:13:43,111
For tenants unable to pay rent,

274
00:13:43,351 --> 00:13:45,111
we can temporarily
suspend rent collection

275
00:13:45,111 --> 00:13:47,790
and offer proportional reductions

276
00:13:47,830 --> 00:13:49,471
until tenants get relocated.

277
00:13:49,471 --> 00:13:52,031
Second, rent refunds.

278
00:13:52,070 --> 00:13:54,111
For prepaid rent,

279
00:13:54,471 --> 00:13:56,670
provide full or partial refunds

280
00:13:56,751 --> 00:13:58,710
to alleviate
the tenants' financial pressure.

281
00:13:59,111 --> 00:14:00,670
That is all.

282
00:14:04,764 --> 00:14:06,632
(Thank you!
By Ren Jiatong, Guo Xiaoyu, Huang Yue)

283
00:14:06,910 --> 00:14:08,310
If by 10 PM tonight,

284
00:14:08,351 --> 00:14:10,231
you can't present a better plan,

285
00:14:10,670 --> 00:14:12,950
the Warm Nest meeting
will be handled by me, Ren Jiatong,

286
00:14:13,351 --> 00:14:14,151
and your team.

287
00:14:15,670 --> 00:14:16,296
Okay.

288
00:14:23,676 --> 00:14:30,632
(Ren Jiatong: I brought Huang Yue in
because she could help us.)

289
00:14:30,632 --> 00:14:32,904
(Competitors are competitors.)

290
00:14:32,904 --> 00:14:34,670
(Never show your back, not even on me.)

291
00:14:34,670 --> 00:14:35,710
(Friendship and rivalry.)

292
00:14:36,271 --> 00:14:37,670
(Guo Xiaoyu repeatedly)

293
00:14:37,670 --> 00:14:39,271
(faces the dilemma.)

294
00:14:44,550 --> 00:14:45,096
Everyone,

295
00:14:45,231 --> 00:14:46,190
it's exactly 9 PM.

296
00:14:46,550 --> 00:14:48,031
The final hour countdown starts.

297
00:14:48,511 --> 00:14:49,631
Submit your final proposals

298
00:14:49,631 --> 00:14:50,550
on time.

299
00:14:51,550 --> 00:14:52,231
One minute late,

300
00:14:52,871 --> 00:14:53,550
it's invalidated.

301
00:14:53,910 --> 00:14:54,790
Receive the file.

302
00:14:55,511 --> 00:14:56,391
(Throughout this day,)

303
00:14:56,751 --> 00:14:58,950
(Li Ke should be the best
at making decisions.)

304
00:15:09,751 --> 00:15:10,376
Mr. Zhou.

305
00:15:10,590 --> 00:15:11,751
With such tight timelines,

306
00:15:12,070 --> 00:15:13,151
can we form teams?

307
00:15:13,471 --> 00:15:14,391
Right.

308
00:15:14,871 --> 00:15:15,790
You can form teams,

309
00:15:16,430 --> 00:15:17,031
meaning

310
00:15:17,471 --> 00:15:20,310
(Current points: 25)
points reflect battles between groups

311
00:15:20,710 --> 00:15:21,751
(Current points: 35)
and inside them.

312
00:15:21,871 --> 00:15:22,910
So that means

313
00:15:22,950 --> 00:15:24,991
(Current points: 35)
I need both my group to win

314
00:15:25,271 --> 00:15:27,751
(Current points: 40)
and my performance to be top in my group

315
00:15:28,031 --> 00:15:29,111
for high scores.

316
00:15:29,190 --> 00:15:29,832
Exactly.

317
00:15:30,920 --> 00:15:32,670
(Current points: 30)
Don't you want to work with top lawyers?

318
00:15:33,064 --> 00:15:34,190
(Li Ke and His Adorer)
Rare chance.

319
00:15:34,550 --> 00:15:35,950
Show your best moves now.

320
00:15:48,950 --> 00:15:50,991
Okay, sweetie, happy birthday.

321
00:15:51,070 --> 00:15:52,910
I will get you a big cake when I'm back.

322
00:15:56,471 --> 00:15:58,231
I miss you too. I miss you too.

323
00:16:00,310 --> 00:16:00,968
Here.

324
00:16:01,511 --> 00:16:03,031
Thanks, thanks.

325
00:16:04,710 --> 00:16:07,590
It's my niece's birthday today, see?

326
00:16:08,070 --> 00:16:09,031
She's so adorable.

327
00:16:09,031 --> 00:16:09,670
Absolutely.

328
00:16:10,310 --> 00:16:12,070
Let me recommend you a bakery.

329
00:16:12,070 --> 00:16:13,031
Their cakes are amazing.

330
00:16:13,391 --> 00:16:14,190
Really?

331
00:16:14,190 --> 00:16:14,830
Good.

332
00:16:15,656 --> 00:16:16,271
Sent it to you.

333
00:16:16,271 --> 00:16:16,830
Thanks.

334
00:16:18,590 --> 00:16:20,550
How do you adjust
your mindset like this?

335
00:16:21,271 --> 00:16:22,031
It's impressive.

336
00:16:22,310 --> 00:16:23,511
When working earlier,

337
00:16:23,511 --> 00:16:24,351
you looked drained.

338
00:16:24,351 --> 00:16:25,751
Now, you're fine again.

339
00:16:26,790 --> 00:16:29,471
With my last-round ranking so low,
how could I not be looking down?

340
00:16:29,670 --> 00:16:31,231
I'm practically falling apart.

341
00:16:31,871 --> 00:16:32,511
But

342
00:16:32,631 --> 00:16:34,471
you shouldn't listen to my complaints.

343
00:16:35,031 --> 00:16:36,471
I don't want to spread negativity

344
00:16:36,471 --> 00:16:37,471
to those around me.

345
00:16:38,190 --> 00:16:39,070
Especially now,

346
00:16:39,430 --> 00:16:40,710
when everyone's under pressure.

347
00:16:41,790 --> 00:16:43,950
Besides, your niece
is genuinely adorable.

348
00:16:44,231 --> 00:16:44,991
So heartwarming.

349
00:16:45,151 --> 00:16:45,871
Of course she is.

350
00:16:46,710 --> 00:16:47,950
How's your proposal?

351
00:16:49,310 --> 00:16:50,430
Just okay.

352
00:16:50,950 --> 00:16:51,991
Hoping to at least pass.

353
00:16:52,351 --> 00:16:53,031
A passing grade?

354
00:16:54,710 --> 00:16:56,910
Back in school, passing was good enough.

355
00:16:57,590 --> 00:16:58,670
But in the workplace,

356
00:16:58,790 --> 00:17:00,070
it is nowhere near sufficient.

357
00:17:02,190 --> 00:17:03,871
Maybe you should team up with someone?

358
00:17:04,870 --> 00:17:06,911
I'm at the bottom tier. Can't help you.

359
00:17:07,031 --> 00:17:08,711
But if you partner
with the right person,

360
00:17:08,711 --> 00:17:09,751
maybe next round,

361
00:17:09,751 --> 00:17:11,150
both our scores could improve.

362
00:17:12,671 --> 00:17:13,590
Teaming up?

363
00:17:15,991 --> 00:17:18,031
I just saw Guo Xiaoyu and Ren Jiatong

364
00:17:18,231 --> 00:17:20,070
head to the small conference room.

365
00:17:27,751 --> 00:17:28,390
S-Sorry.

366
00:17:28,390 --> 00:17:29,150
I have to go.

367
00:17:35,070 --> 00:17:36,711
Ms. Bai's mentoring style hasn't changed

368
00:17:36,711 --> 00:17:37,511
over the years.

369
00:17:37,870 --> 00:17:39,031
Always playing the villain.

370
00:17:39,390 --> 00:17:41,471
If she hadn't fought
for Jiang Chen this time,

371
00:17:41,991 --> 00:17:43,830
he wouldn't have just gotten
point deductions.

372
00:17:44,991 --> 00:17:46,751
Warm Nest really put us in a tough spot.

373
00:17:47,231 --> 00:17:49,350
During critical negotiations,

374
00:17:49,550 --> 00:17:50,830
your brother-in-law's stunt

375
00:17:51,150 --> 00:17:52,431
gave them the perfect excuse

376
00:17:52,511 --> 00:17:53,550
to shift blame onto us.

377
00:17:54,110 --> 00:17:55,191
From what I gathered,

378
00:17:55,590 --> 00:17:56,671
Warm Nest's legal director

379
00:17:56,991 --> 00:17:58,271
is pushing their CEO

380
00:17:58,271 --> 00:17:59,150
to replace our firm.

381
00:17:59,671 --> 00:18:00,711
Notice those subtle digs

382
00:18:00,711 --> 00:18:01,911
during the meeting?

383
00:18:02,511 --> 00:18:03,150
My fault.

384
00:18:03,550 --> 00:18:04,751
I failed with my family issue.

385
00:18:05,150 --> 00:18:06,191
I've tried all morning.

386
00:18:06,350 --> 00:18:07,830
Xiaosong and his sister blocked me.

387
00:18:08,191 --> 00:18:09,310
After the test is over,

388
00:18:10,070 --> 00:18:11,110
I'll go apologize.

389
00:18:12,790 --> 00:18:14,590
As a woman,

390
00:18:15,031 --> 00:18:16,590
I can understand your girlfriend.

391
00:18:17,350 --> 00:18:18,711
But as a colleague,

392
00:18:19,911 --> 00:18:20,951
it feels infuriating.

393
00:18:26,511 --> 00:18:28,671
This isn't just about Mr. Zhou anymore.

394
00:18:29,110 --> 00:18:30,630
The entire firm

395
00:18:30,630 --> 00:18:31,870
is working on it, right?

396
00:18:33,511 --> 00:18:34,511
Bring that up?

397
00:18:35,191 --> 00:18:36,110
Let's stop talking.

398
00:18:36,511 --> 00:18:37,064
Wait.

399
00:18:37,951 --> 00:18:39,590
You don't fear Warm Nest's legal action,

400
00:18:39,590 --> 00:18:40,790
but Mr. Zhou does.

401
00:18:41,431 --> 00:18:42,790
You can claim

402
00:18:42,790 --> 00:18:43,550
you're the victim,

403
00:18:43,671 --> 00:18:44,511
but can he?

404
00:18:44,711 --> 00:18:45,870
If Warm Nest investigates,

405
00:18:45,870 --> 00:18:46,751
can they bypass him?

406
00:18:47,031 --> 00:18:48,431
But how is this his responsibility?

407
00:18:48,630 --> 00:18:50,191
He didn't wrong us

408
00:18:50,191 --> 00:18:51,630
or his fiancée.

409
00:18:51,951 --> 00:18:53,070
Why is he being blamed?

410
00:18:53,070 --> 00:18:54,031
You're so selfish.

411
00:18:56,830 --> 00:18:57,671
I see you're worried,

412
00:18:58,951 --> 00:19:01,031
and I don't want Mr. Zhou
to suffer for me, either.

413
00:19:01,630 --> 00:19:02,870
Liang Xiaosong wants money.

414
00:19:02,870 --> 00:19:03,590
I'll pay him.

415
00:19:03,991 --> 00:19:04,790
Just give me time.

416
00:19:04,790 --> 00:19:06,511
I'll have a solution by afternoon. Okay?

417
00:19:07,431 --> 00:19:07,991
I'm sorry.

418
00:19:07,991 --> 00:19:09,471
I got too emotional earlier.

419
00:19:10,110 --> 00:19:10,951
But anyway,

420
00:19:10,951 --> 00:19:12,711
your compensation is peanuts

421
00:19:13,271 --> 00:19:15,070
compared to the millions
Jun An could lose

422
00:19:15,070 --> 00:19:16,031
if our firm is replaced

423
00:19:16,031 --> 00:19:17,870
by Warm Nest.

424
00:19:17,870 --> 00:19:19,711
Even if we sold off you, me and Mr. Zhou

425
00:19:19,711 --> 00:19:20,671
together,

426
00:19:20,671 --> 00:19:21,550
we couldn't cover it.

427
00:19:22,031 --> 00:19:23,110
Don't be reckless now.

428
00:19:24,150 --> 00:19:24,712
Understood.

429
00:19:27,110 --> 00:19:27,991
Honestly,

430
00:19:28,911 --> 00:19:30,630
apologizing isn't that hard.

431
00:19:31,070 --> 00:19:33,271
Post on Weibo or WeChat,

432
00:19:33,790 --> 00:19:35,432
even set it to be viewed "only by him".

433
00:19:35,711 --> 00:19:37,231
It's just about showing goodwill.

434
00:19:37,471 --> 00:19:39,231
How can principles be

435
00:19:39,231 --> 00:19:39,991
casually changed?

436
00:19:41,870 --> 00:19:42,536
So you...

437
00:19:48,471 --> 00:19:49,751
Only you're the principled one?

438
00:19:57,711 --> 00:19:58,711
I saw in the group chat.

439
00:19:58,711 --> 00:20:00,031
You'll give Mr. Zhou's girlfriend

440
00:20:00,031 --> 00:20:00,991
a surprise?

441
00:20:01,110 --> 00:20:02,231
Count me in.

442
00:20:04,191 --> 00:20:05,191
Not sure if it'll work.

443
00:20:05,671 --> 00:20:06,471
I heard

444
00:20:06,471 --> 00:20:07,191
Mr. Zhou might be

445
00:20:07,191 --> 00:20:08,830
affected by his brother-in-law's issue.

446
00:20:09,150 --> 00:20:10,431
If this escalates,

447
00:20:10,431 --> 00:20:11,590
Warm Nest will come after us.

448
00:20:11,590 --> 00:20:13,191
Forget surprises. We'll be done for.

449
00:20:13,550 --> 00:20:14,110
Surprise?

450
00:20:14,310 --> 00:20:15,471
Are you implying

451
00:20:15,590 --> 00:20:17,471
the Warm Nest matter
will affect Mr. Zhou?

452
00:20:17,711 --> 00:20:18,550
Not just him.

453
00:20:19,191 --> 00:20:20,110
The entire firm...

454
00:20:28,070 --> 00:20:28,616
Fei.

455
00:20:29,390 --> 00:20:30,024
Look.

456
00:20:30,310 --> 00:20:32,911
Jiang Chen's involved
in such a major problem.

457
00:20:33,191 --> 00:20:34,431
If we team up

458
00:20:34,911 --> 00:20:36,110
in this round,

459
00:20:36,590 --> 00:20:37,751
we might overtake him.

460
00:20:40,191 --> 00:20:41,590
Doesn't it frustrate you

461
00:20:41,590 --> 00:20:42,350
to be overshadowed?

462
00:20:43,550 --> 00:20:45,070
Include me when you finalize the plan.

463
00:20:45,830 --> 00:20:47,790
As for the assessment,
I think we should depend on

464
00:20:48,070 --> 00:20:49,031
our own ability.

465
00:20:51,830 --> 00:20:52,360
See you.

466
00:20:59,951 --> 00:21:00,870
We have two proposals.

467
00:21:00,870 --> 00:21:02,550
First, rent reduction.

468
00:21:02,590 --> 00:21:04,830
For tenants unable to pay rent,

469
00:21:05,110 --> 00:21:06,830
we can temporarily
suspend rent collection

470
00:21:06,830 --> 00:21:09,271
and offer proportional reductions

471
00:21:09,310 --> 00:21:10,911
until tenants get relocated.

472
00:21:10,951 --> 00:21:13,231
Second, rent refunds.

473
00:21:13,271 --> 00:21:15,310
For prepaid rent,

474
00:21:15,511 --> 00:21:17,671
provide full or partial refunds

475
00:21:17,790 --> 00:21:19,671
to alleviate
the tenants' financial pressure.

476
00:21:19,790 --> 00:21:21,310
That is all.

477
00:21:21,390 --> 00:21:22,031
Hello, everyone.

478
00:21:22,031 --> 00:21:23,191
My approach is continuing

479
00:21:23,191 --> 00:21:24,431
litigation preparations.

480
00:21:24,550 --> 00:21:26,511
If settlement negotiations fail,

481
00:21:26,511 --> 00:21:27,671
we need backup strategies.

482
00:21:28,350 --> 00:21:29,550
If you ever research

483
00:21:29,550 --> 00:21:31,751
numerous rental contract disputes

484
00:21:31,751 --> 00:21:32,951
in legal practice,

485
00:21:33,431 --> 00:21:35,431
you'll find this path challenging.

486
00:21:36,271 --> 00:21:36,968
Ms. Bai.

487
00:21:37,590 --> 00:21:38,350
Let him finish.

488
00:21:39,150 --> 00:21:39,991
He's working hard.

489
00:21:41,390 --> 00:21:41,992
Li Ke.

490
00:21:43,630 --> 00:21:44,296
Continue.

491
00:21:46,271 --> 00:21:46,824
Alright.

492
00:21:56,110 --> 00:21:56,744
Jiang Chen.

493
00:21:57,911 --> 00:22:00,031
Your earlier suggestion

494
00:22:00,031 --> 00:22:01,031
shows potential.

495
00:22:01,150 --> 00:22:01,911
I have some ideas.

496
00:22:01,911 --> 00:22:02,536
Want to

497
00:22:02,790 --> 00:22:03,550
talk about it?

498
00:22:03,711 --> 00:22:04,471
Maybe

499
00:22:05,511 --> 00:22:06,231
I can help.

500
00:22:06,911 --> 00:22:07,560
No, thanks.

501
00:22:07,911 --> 00:22:08,550
I can handle it.

502
00:22:10,711 --> 00:22:11,830
More hands make light work.

503
00:22:12,191 --> 00:22:14,191
We might win first place together.

504
00:22:17,951 --> 00:22:18,911
Is this because

505
00:22:19,511 --> 00:22:20,870
we just argued?

506
00:22:21,271 --> 00:22:21,928
So...

507
00:22:22,911 --> 00:22:23,550
That's separate.

508
00:22:24,630 --> 00:22:26,271
I'm not refusing teamwork,

509
00:22:26,671 --> 00:22:28,550
but this case is special.

510
00:22:28,830 --> 00:22:30,110
It's not only a legal case,

511
00:22:30,310 --> 00:22:31,231
but also

512
00:22:31,830 --> 00:22:32,790
a personal matter.

513
00:22:33,310 --> 00:22:34,271
I must handle it myself.

514
00:22:35,231 --> 00:22:35,976
Keep going.

515
00:22:36,991 --> 00:22:37,640
Wait...

516
00:22:51,511 --> 00:22:52,271
Go, Uncle.

517
00:22:52,350 --> 00:22:53,830
Uncle's the best.

518
00:23:03,150 --> 00:23:04,590
(If by 10 PM tonight,)

519
00:23:04,590 --> 00:23:06,550
(you can't present a better plan,)

520
00:23:06,751 --> 00:23:09,070
(the Warm Nest meeting
will be handled by me, Ren Jiatong,)

521
00:23:09,431 --> 00:23:10,271
(and your team.)

522
00:23:14,671 --> 00:23:15,390
Everyone,

523
00:23:15,390 --> 00:23:16,310
it's exactly 9 PM.

524
00:23:16,671 --> 00:23:18,070
The final hour countdown starts.

525
00:23:18,751 --> 00:23:19,870
Submit your final proposals

526
00:23:19,870 --> 00:23:20,790
on time.

527
00:23:21,671 --> 00:23:22,376
One minute late,

528
00:23:22,951 --> 00:23:23,630
it's invalidated.

529
00:23:24,590 --> 00:23:25,431
Receive the file.

530
00:23:41,070 --> 00:23:41,800
Come in.

531
00:23:43,144 --> 00:23:44,070
Mr. Zhuang.

532
00:23:44,070 --> 00:23:44,711
Waiting for you.

533
00:23:45,630 --> 00:23:46,271
Ms. Bai,

534
00:23:47,191 --> 00:23:48,711
must we be so harsh?

535
00:23:51,031 --> 00:23:52,830
If someone collapses from overwork,

536
00:23:53,310 --> 00:23:55,550
our firm will be labeled

537
00:23:55,550 --> 00:23:56,271
as bloodsuckers.

538
00:23:57,390 --> 00:23:58,390
Our firm advocates for

539
00:23:58,390 --> 00:23:59,271
work-life balance.

540
00:23:59,271 --> 00:24:00,191
This isn't empty talk.

541
00:24:00,350 --> 00:24:00,991
Look at them.

542
00:24:01,231 --> 00:24:02,231
I didn't force them.

543
00:24:02,350 --> 00:24:04,150
Haven't we all gone through that?

544
00:24:04,590 --> 00:24:05,630
Plus, back when we

545
00:24:05,630 --> 00:24:07,310
worked cases with Mr. Zhuang,

546
00:24:07,511 --> 00:24:09,191
we pulled just as many all-nighters.

547
00:24:09,511 --> 00:24:10,070
Right?

548
00:24:10,070 --> 00:24:10,824
Don't.

549
00:24:11,191 --> 00:24:12,231
Don't drag me into this.

550
00:24:12,751 --> 00:24:14,471
You all volunteered to work overtime.

551
00:24:14,870 --> 00:24:16,830
No threats or bribes from me.

552
00:24:17,550 --> 00:24:18,110
Right?

553
00:24:18,991 --> 00:24:19,656
Right.

554
00:24:20,350 --> 00:24:21,271
I hear they are

555
00:24:21,271 --> 00:24:22,070
secretly planning

556
00:24:22,550 --> 00:24:24,511
to help Zhou Nian
reconcile with his girlfriend.

557
00:24:25,150 --> 00:24:26,590
They say Zhou Nian always

558
00:24:26,590 --> 00:24:27,671
puts in so much for them.

559
00:24:27,951 --> 00:24:29,231
He must have his wedding day.

560
00:24:30,390 --> 00:24:31,790
We have a great eye for talent.

561
00:24:32,310 --> 00:24:32,991
These kids

562
00:24:33,310 --> 00:24:34,110
are all decent.

563
00:24:36,911 --> 00:24:37,991
You two have been working

564
00:24:38,310 --> 00:24:40,751
round the clock with Warm Nest.

565
00:24:41,471 --> 00:24:42,110
Thank you.

566
00:24:45,150 --> 00:24:47,350
I heard there was an issue earlier.

567
00:24:48,231 --> 00:24:49,110
How's it now?

568
00:24:50,070 --> 00:24:51,711
They did mention wanting

569
00:24:51,711 --> 00:24:54,150
to transfer other business
to other firms.

570
00:24:54,550 --> 00:24:55,231
But for now,

571
00:24:55,231 --> 00:24:56,350
we've put that on hold.

572
00:24:56,751 --> 00:24:58,191
Mr. Song's financing proposal

573
00:24:58,191 --> 00:25:00,191
received strong approval
from their CEO, Mr. Liu.

574
00:25:00,191 --> 00:25:01,830
The investors we connected them with

575
00:25:01,830 --> 00:25:03,310
provided initial letters of intent.

576
00:25:03,951 --> 00:25:04,471
Here.

577
00:25:04,911 --> 00:25:05,448
Good.

578
00:25:16,751 --> 00:25:17,790
But their legal director

579
00:25:18,231 --> 00:25:19,511
seems off to me.

580
00:25:19,991 --> 00:25:21,590
A lucrative client like Warm Nest

581
00:25:22,191 --> 00:25:23,390
naturally attracts

582
00:25:24,070 --> 00:25:24,951
big law firms.

583
00:25:33,630 --> 00:25:34,152
Come in.

584
00:25:35,191 --> 00:25:35,848
Ms. Bai.

585
00:25:36,110 --> 00:25:36,711
You need me?

586
00:25:37,350 --> 00:25:38,711
I reviewed your report.

587
00:25:39,350 --> 00:25:40,751
Your compensation estimates

588
00:25:40,751 --> 00:25:42,070
favor the tenants' perspective.

589
00:25:42,511 --> 00:25:43,830
Because you're a tenant yourself?

590
00:25:45,390 --> 00:25:46,671
But have you considered

591
00:25:46,671 --> 00:25:47,550
the landlords?

592
00:25:48,150 --> 00:25:49,150
The other day,

593
00:25:49,231 --> 00:25:50,191
at Warm Nest,

594
00:25:50,191 --> 00:25:51,590
that huge conflict erupted

595
00:25:52,110 --> 00:25:52,671
because

596
00:25:52,671 --> 00:25:54,350
many landlords were also protesting.

597
00:25:54,630 --> 00:25:55,991
Just because they hit you

598
00:25:56,231 --> 00:25:58,271
doesn't mean you ignore
their legitimate claims.

599
00:25:58,271 --> 00:26:00,071
Your report is well-formed now,

600
00:26:00,136 --> 00:26:01,323
but I want it to be better.

601
00:26:15,590 --> 00:26:16,870
I'm not hogging this spot.

602
00:26:18,390 --> 00:26:19,110
Half is yours.

603
00:26:23,310 --> 00:26:24,951
I just spoke with Ms. Bai.

604
00:26:25,991 --> 00:26:27,310
I need to apologize.

605
00:26:30,711 --> 00:26:31,471
You've come around?

606
00:26:32,231 --> 00:26:32,911
Not at all.

607
00:26:34,671 --> 00:26:35,830
But in the pantry,

608
00:26:36,991 --> 00:26:38,350
I overheard our BD director Kai

609
00:26:38,790 --> 00:26:39,870
apologizing to Warm Nest

610
00:26:39,870 --> 00:26:41,550
about my situation.

611
00:26:42,031 --> 00:26:43,790
It made me uncomfortable.

612
00:26:44,150 --> 00:26:46,590
If Jun An loses

613
00:26:47,511 --> 00:26:49,031
a major client paying premium fees

614
00:26:49,031 --> 00:26:51,590
because of my personal issues,

615
00:26:52,070 --> 00:26:53,951
then fighting for my rights

616
00:26:53,951 --> 00:26:54,751
costs too much.

617
00:26:58,671 --> 00:27:00,390
A great lawyer once told me

618
00:27:02,431 --> 00:27:04,590
the first lesson for us
was learning to compromise.

619
00:27:04,830 --> 00:27:05,471
I didn't buy it.

620
00:27:06,590 --> 00:27:08,431
Now, I'm having doubts.

621
00:27:10,031 --> 00:27:11,671
Was that great lawyer

622
00:27:12,271 --> 00:27:13,031
your father?

623
00:27:18,711 --> 00:27:19,471
I understand him,

624
00:27:20,191 --> 00:27:20,870
but I

625
00:27:21,350 --> 00:27:22,511
don't want to become him.

626
00:27:24,031 --> 00:27:25,550
Maybe I'm not cut out to be a lawyer.

627
00:27:28,350 --> 00:27:29,271
What did Mr. Song say?

628
00:27:30,790 --> 00:27:31,870
He asked if I apologized

629
00:27:31,870 --> 00:27:33,390
for Jun An now,

630
00:27:36,070 --> 00:27:37,271
how I'd view myself

631
00:27:37,590 --> 00:27:38,390
and this profession

632
00:27:39,231 --> 00:27:40,951
in the future.

633
00:27:42,911 --> 00:27:43,751
I told him I'd be

634
00:27:45,110 --> 00:27:46,511
deeply disappointed in myself.

635
00:27:47,511 --> 00:27:50,110
Just like I've been let down
by other lawyers.

636
00:27:51,191 --> 00:27:52,431
I might end up becoming

637
00:27:52,431 --> 00:27:53,830
that kind of lawyer.

638
00:27:54,751 --> 00:27:55,790
I want to make good money.

639
00:27:55,951 --> 00:27:56,951
I want to win every time.

640
00:28:03,031 --> 00:28:04,350
That lawyer also told me

641
00:28:06,271 --> 00:28:07,191
in our profession,

642
00:28:07,191 --> 00:28:08,911
you must maintain sufficient hunger

643
00:28:09,350 --> 00:28:10,150
and ambition.

644
00:28:12,031 --> 00:28:13,070
You possess both.

645
00:28:13,751 --> 00:28:15,310
I believe if he were here,

646
00:28:15,310 --> 00:28:16,031
he'd say you'd

647
00:28:16,031 --> 00:28:17,350
make a better lawyer than me.

648
00:28:18,711 --> 00:28:19,368
Really?

649
00:28:20,310 --> 00:28:21,070
Of course not.

650
00:28:21,110 --> 00:28:21,630
I made it up.

651
00:28:22,671 --> 00:28:24,790
Mr. Song said instead of compromising,

652
00:28:24,790 --> 00:28:25,310
we should

653
00:28:25,310 --> 00:28:26,790
try to think of a win-win solution.

654
00:28:27,310 --> 00:28:28,671
So I came up here to brainstorm.

655
00:28:29,951 --> 00:28:30,696
What about you?

656
00:28:31,511 --> 00:28:32,350
Ms. Bai scolded you.

657
00:28:33,150 --> 00:28:34,070
What was it about?

658
00:28:35,550 --> 00:28:36,390
How do you know?

659
00:28:39,671 --> 00:28:40,711
Since you joined Jun An,

660
00:28:40,711 --> 00:28:42,191
she hasn't scolded you often.

661
00:28:42,271 --> 00:28:43,991
But whenever it happens,
you come up here

662
00:28:44,231 --> 00:28:45,310
for exactly ten minutes.

663
00:28:55,471 --> 00:28:56,991
I used to be quite confident,

664
00:28:58,031 --> 00:28:59,150
but I never imagined

665
00:28:59,350 --> 00:29:00,590
making such a rookie mistake.

666
00:29:01,390 --> 00:29:02,150
But

667
00:29:02,630 --> 00:29:03,751
Ms. Bai helped me realize

668
00:29:03,751 --> 00:29:06,110
the importance of thinking
from the landlords' perspective.

669
00:29:07,110 --> 00:29:08,671
But my interactions with them

670
00:29:09,031 --> 00:29:10,790
are limited to that fight at Warm Nest

671
00:29:11,431 --> 00:29:12,911
and my argument on move-in day

672
00:29:13,070 --> 00:29:14,191
with your aunt.

673
00:29:20,150 --> 00:29:20,711
Jiang Chen,

674
00:29:21,590 --> 00:29:22,991
your aunt is my landlord.

675
00:29:26,911 --> 00:29:28,991
I think I've found the solution.

676
00:29:30,271 --> 00:29:31,951
I need to have a talk with my aunt.

677
00:29:36,991 --> 00:29:37,870
10 minutes are up.

678
00:29:39,191 --> 00:29:39,816
Let's go.

679
00:29:40,150 --> 00:29:41,110
The battle isn't over.

680
00:29:41,431 --> 00:29:42,310
Actually, it's true.

681
00:29:44,431 --> 00:29:45,160
What?

682
00:29:46,590 --> 00:29:48,751
You're the most suited one
for the law I've ever met.

683
00:29:50,630 --> 00:29:51,231
I know.

684
00:30:03,751 --> 00:30:04,310
Guo Xiaoyu,

685
00:30:04,550 --> 00:30:05,711
you handle proofreading.

686
00:30:05,991 --> 00:30:06,550
No problem.

687
00:30:06,830 --> 00:30:07,431
Huang Yue,

688
00:30:07,431 --> 00:30:08,310
assist Jiang Chen

689
00:30:08,310 --> 00:30:09,911
in analyzing the landlords' needs.

690
00:30:15,271 --> 00:30:16,231
There are three hours.

691
00:30:16,870 --> 00:30:17,751
I'll go talk to Liang.

692
00:30:21,031 --> 00:30:21,911
Let me do it.

693
00:30:23,590 --> 00:30:24,911
We're a team now.

694
00:30:25,231 --> 00:30:26,110
I'm the team leader.

695
00:30:26,110 --> 00:30:28,231
I expect you to listen to me.

696
00:30:29,231 --> 00:30:30,271
Moreover, this plan

697
00:30:30,271 --> 00:30:32,070
requires your aunt's full cooperation.

698
00:30:32,150 --> 00:30:33,110
So you need to stay here

699
00:30:33,110 --> 00:30:34,630
to ensure every word is flawless.

700
00:30:37,751 --> 00:30:39,070
The Warm Nest crisis

701
00:30:39,070 --> 00:30:40,271
started because of me.

702
00:30:41,191 --> 00:30:42,070
I'll go myself.

703
00:30:42,471 --> 00:30:43,070
Besides,

704
00:30:43,350 --> 00:30:44,911
I'm not going to bow and apologize.

705
00:30:45,471 --> 00:30:47,031
I'll make him apologize to us.

706
00:30:50,431 --> 00:30:51,830
I can accompany Ren Jiatong.

707
00:30:55,271 --> 00:30:56,310
I want to help Jun An

708
00:30:56,751 --> 00:30:57,991
and Mr. Zhou with this.

709
00:30:59,671 --> 00:31:00,296
Okay?

710
00:31:04,431 --> 00:31:05,231
Absolutely.

711
00:31:05,991 --> 00:31:06,632
Come here.

712
00:31:13,671 --> 00:31:15,390
To clear Jiang Chen's name,

713
00:31:16,231 --> 00:31:17,431
I repeatedly watched

714
00:31:17,471 --> 00:31:19,070
the video of his conflict with Liang.

715
00:31:19,390 --> 00:31:21,070
See this guy with the buzz cut?

716
00:31:21,350 --> 00:31:21,991
Remember him?

717
00:31:27,630 --> 00:31:29,550
I think I saw him
at the Warm Nest branch.

718
00:31:30,431 --> 00:31:31,830
The handwritten response.

719
00:31:32,296 --> 00:31:32,951
Xiaoyu,

720
00:31:32,951 --> 00:31:34,630
check your livestream video

721
00:31:34,751 --> 00:31:36,431
to see if he was present that day.

722
00:31:36,751 --> 00:31:37,384
Let me check.

723
00:31:41,150 --> 00:31:41,832
I found him.

724
00:31:46,231 --> 00:31:47,271
Who is this guy anyway?

725
00:31:47,271 --> 00:31:48,150
He's everywhere.

726
00:31:56,110 --> 00:31:58,310
On the day of our Warm Nest conflict,

727
00:31:58,671 --> 00:32:00,951
that man with you
was a lawyer too, right?

728
00:32:01,590 --> 00:32:02,184
What?

729
00:32:02,431 --> 00:32:03,310
He's not a tenant,

730
00:32:03,310 --> 00:32:04,231
not a landlord,

731
00:32:04,590 --> 00:32:05,991
and not Warm Nest's legal staff.

732
00:32:06,870 --> 00:32:08,751
He's a lawyer from our competitor firm.

733
00:32:09,031 --> 00:32:10,150
He was present every time.

734
00:32:11,830 --> 00:32:12,424
(Wang Yu)
Look.

735
00:32:12,711 --> 00:32:13,390
It's him, right?

736
00:32:24,070 --> 00:32:25,711
He said he was Warm Nest's legal member

737
00:32:27,070 --> 00:32:29,150
and that you were
from Jun An to gather intel.

738
00:32:29,590 --> 00:32:30,911
And that you were a tenant.

739
00:32:31,271 --> 00:32:32,671
So Jun An would never take my side

740
00:32:33,431 --> 00:32:34,550
or compensate us.

741
00:32:35,790 --> 00:32:36,511
That water bottle

742
00:32:37,231 --> 00:32:37,870
was from him.

743
00:32:41,110 --> 00:32:41,870
Song.

744
00:32:42,630 --> 00:32:44,231
Your sister's been dating Mr. Zhou

745
00:32:44,231 --> 00:32:45,471
for almost eight years, right?

746
00:32:45,790 --> 00:32:47,991
Don't you get
how these power games work?

747
00:32:48,471 --> 00:32:49,951
They're setting you up.

748
00:32:50,671 --> 00:32:51,830
Don't do anything stupid.

749
00:33:10,671 --> 00:33:12,471
We got
Liang Xiaosong's apology statement.

750
00:33:14,630 --> 00:33:15,272
Great.

751
00:33:21,052 --> 00:33:22,664
(Completed by: Ren Jiatong, Jiang Chen,
Guo Xiaoyu, Huang Yue, and Li Ke)

752
00:33:30,671 --> 00:33:31,870
Good work.

753
00:33:32,471 --> 00:33:33,671
Mission accomplished, guys.

754
00:33:40,150 --> 00:33:41,590
- Mr. Zhou.
- Two proposals received.

755
00:33:41,790 --> 00:33:42,711
Both submitted timely.

756
00:33:43,110 --> 00:33:44,590
Go have some rest now.

757
00:33:45,550 --> 00:33:46,511
Two?

758
00:33:46,590 --> 00:33:47,590
Yan Fei submitted hers?

759
00:33:48,031 --> 00:33:49,711
I haven't seen her all afternoon.

760
00:33:50,031 --> 00:33:50,830
She left early

761
00:33:51,191 --> 00:33:52,790
but submitted hers before closing time.

762
00:33:54,150 --> 00:33:54,856
Mr. Zhou.

763
00:33:54,856 --> 00:33:55,471
Look,

764
00:33:55,471 --> 00:33:57,310
we've been grinding all day

765
00:33:57,390 --> 00:33:58,790
to pass the assessment.

766
00:33:59,191 --> 00:34:01,110
How about treating us to dinner tonight?

767
00:34:01,671 --> 00:34:02,471
Unwind a bit.

768
00:34:03,870 --> 00:34:04,590
You brat.

769
00:34:05,031 --> 00:34:06,031
Next time.

770
00:34:06,431 --> 00:34:07,191
I got a thing.

771
00:34:07,711 --> 00:34:08,750
Go easy on the drinks,

772
00:34:08,871 --> 00:34:09,431
and stay safe.

773
00:34:10,110 --> 00:34:10,791
Mr. Zhou!

774
00:34:11,630 --> 00:34:12,150
Mr. Zhou.

775
00:34:22,991 --> 00:34:23,528
What's this?

776
00:34:24,070 --> 00:34:24,776
Mr. Zhou,

777
00:34:25,070 --> 00:34:26,150
we all think

778
00:34:26,311 --> 00:34:28,431
you broke up
with your girlfriend because of us.

779
00:34:28,991 --> 00:34:30,311
We want to make it right.

780
00:34:34,630 --> 00:34:36,150
Yan Fei provided this box.

781
00:34:36,550 --> 00:34:39,590
I saw you retrieve the ring
and fiddle with it all day.

782
00:34:39,590 --> 00:34:40,311
Put it inside.

783
00:34:42,590 --> 00:34:43,550
W-What's happening?

784
00:34:44,270 --> 00:34:44,871
Let me explain.

785
00:34:45,991 --> 00:34:47,230
First, Mr. Zhou,

786
00:34:47,511 --> 00:34:48,031
this is

787
00:34:48,110 --> 00:34:50,230
your future wife's RedNote location.

788
00:34:50,230 --> 00:34:51,550
She's at this bar right now.

789
00:34:51,710 --> 00:34:52,791
Take a taxi there.

790
00:34:52,791 --> 00:34:53,710
It's a 10-minute ride.

791
00:34:53,710 --> 00:34:54,991
The taxi's waiting downstairs.

792
00:34:55,351 --> 00:34:57,951
I've prepared confession poems for you

793
00:34:57,951 --> 00:34:59,511
to memorize during the ride.

794
00:34:59,710 --> 00:35:00,232
Finally,

795
00:35:01,991 --> 00:35:02,710
the ring,

796
00:35:03,311 --> 00:35:05,190
roses,

797
00:35:05,590 --> 00:35:07,511
and her favorite teddy bear.

798
00:35:08,351 --> 00:35:11,031
Confess this time with these things.

799
00:35:11,311 --> 00:35:11,911
I guarantee

800
00:35:12,070 --> 00:35:12,991
you'll definitely

801
00:35:13,230 --> 00:35:14,270
win her back.

802
00:35:14,750 --> 00:35:15,511
Go, Mr. Zhou.

803
00:35:15,511 --> 00:35:16,991
- Go, Mr. Zhou!
- Get your girl.

804
00:35:17,190 --> 00:35:18,150
- Go.
- You can do this.

805
00:35:21,710 --> 00:35:22,351
Thanks, guys.

806
00:35:24,311 --> 00:35:25,070
- Go!
- Go!

807
00:35:26,031 --> 00:35:26,664
Go.

808
00:35:29,630 --> 00:35:31,031
I vote for hotpot tonight.

809
00:35:31,951 --> 00:35:33,590
Then karaoke after eating.

810
00:35:34,150 --> 00:35:35,391
I have no appetite.

811
00:35:36,110 --> 00:35:36,872
So jealous.

812
00:35:37,190 --> 00:35:38,110
What?

813
00:35:38,911 --> 00:35:41,031
(Xiaojie)
(Jiatong, why aren't you answering?)

814
00:35:41,031 --> 00:35:41,670
I bow my head?

815
00:35:41,791 --> 00:35:42,630
(Xiaojie)
Seriously?

816
00:35:42,630 --> 00:35:44,391
(If you're busy, I'll contact your mom.)

817
00:35:45,110 --> 00:35:47,270
Should I text Mr. Zhou for updates?

818
00:35:47,311 --> 00:35:48,031
- Ask him...
- No!

819
00:35:48,670 --> 00:35:50,590
No news means good news.

820
00:35:50,951 --> 00:35:52,311
They're happily dating now.

821
00:35:52,311 --> 00:35:53,270
Your call would ruin

822
00:35:53,270 --> 00:35:54,270
their moment.

823
00:36:10,431 --> 00:36:11,511
Even my rom-coms don't do

824
00:36:11,511 --> 00:36:13,670
these cheesy rescue scenes anymore.

825
00:36:14,511 --> 00:36:16,630
Corny? Sure.

826
00:36:17,150 --> 00:36:18,230
But weirdly addictive.

827
00:36:20,351 --> 00:36:21,311
Not joining them?

828
00:36:21,871 --> 00:36:23,431
Something came up. You go ahead.

829
00:36:25,230 --> 00:36:27,351
Call if you

830
00:36:28,031 --> 00:36:28,590
need anything.

831
00:36:32,391 --> 00:36:32,911
What's funny?

832
00:36:33,831 --> 00:36:34,511
Nothing.

833
00:36:34,511 --> 00:36:35,590
She's not going with us.

834
00:36:35,750 --> 00:36:36,710
She's got something.

835
00:36:37,630 --> 00:36:38,230
What's wrong?

836
00:36:38,670 --> 00:36:40,391
She looks troubled.

837
00:36:41,391 --> 00:36:42,056
Xiaoyu.

838
00:36:42,351 --> 00:36:43,391
You live with her.

839
00:36:43,791 --> 00:36:46,070
Did she ever talk to you
about her family

840
00:36:47,150 --> 00:36:48,190
or her boyfriend?

841
00:36:48,991 --> 00:36:49,608
No.

842
00:36:49,791 --> 00:36:50,511
Why the curiosity?

843
00:36:50,511 --> 00:36:51,080
Let's go.

844
00:36:51,911 --> 00:36:52,590
No boyfriend.

845
00:36:53,431 --> 00:36:53,992
Let's go.

846
00:36:54,150 --> 00:36:54,792
Go.

847
00:37:07,912 --> 00:37:08,424
(Total: 736
Pay: 731.2)

848
00:37:08,424 --> 00:37:09,630
The hotpot was delicious.

849
00:37:09,951 --> 00:37:10,871
Just way too expensive.

850
00:37:10,871 --> 00:37:11,831
Not doing this again.

851
00:37:12,750 --> 00:37:15,190
Jiang Chen paid the bill before he left.

852
00:37:15,190 --> 00:37:16,511
Let's split the cost with him.

853
00:37:17,750 --> 00:37:19,471
Didn't we just get paid last week?

854
00:37:19,550 --> 00:37:20,831
Time to treat ourselves.

855
00:37:21,150 --> 00:37:22,670
That's true in theory.

856
00:37:23,391 --> 00:37:24,710
But I never understood before.

857
00:37:25,311 --> 00:37:27,590
Now, I realize how hard
it is to earn money.

858
00:37:28,070 --> 00:37:30,511
And somehow in Beijing,
it's never enough.

859
00:37:30,951 --> 00:37:32,031
Last payday,

860
00:37:32,031 --> 00:37:33,190
I rushed eagerly to the mall,

861
00:37:33,791 --> 00:37:34,750
only to find my salary

862
00:37:34,750 --> 00:37:36,710
equivalent to one coat's price.

863
00:37:37,351 --> 00:37:38,710
That mentally hurt me.

864
00:37:39,190 --> 00:37:39,911
Not only you.

865
00:37:40,230 --> 00:37:40,991
My paycheck goes

866
00:37:42,070 --> 00:37:43,190
straight to the landlord.

867
00:37:43,630 --> 00:37:44,311
I can't tell

868
00:37:44,311 --> 00:37:45,511
whether I'm working for Jun An

869
00:37:45,511 --> 00:37:46,590
or that landlord.

870
00:37:47,070 --> 00:37:49,471
I actually find spending my own money

871
00:37:49,630 --> 00:37:50,471
pretty secure.

872
00:37:51,511 --> 00:37:53,190
Time flies.

873
00:37:53,630 --> 00:37:54,951
After the last round,

874
00:37:54,951 --> 00:37:56,871
all seven of us came
for hotpot together.

875
00:37:57,190 --> 00:37:59,110
Now, in the blink of an eye,
only four remain.

876
00:37:59,871 --> 00:38:02,911
When will we reunite
the Talent Hunt Seven Heroes?

877
00:38:03,831 --> 00:38:06,270
I just hope I don't get
eliminated this round.

878
00:38:06,511 --> 00:38:08,911
Even my breathing
reminds me to perform well.

879
00:38:09,791 --> 00:38:10,871
Oh, by the way,

880
00:38:11,190 --> 00:38:12,710
I came across Wang Lu's account

881
00:38:13,110 --> 00:38:14,150
on RedNote the other day.

882
00:38:14,871 --> 00:38:17,270
He's doing great at a boutique firm now.

883
00:38:17,511 --> 00:38:18,471
He started an account.

884
00:38:18,831 --> 00:38:19,464
Look,

885
00:38:19,710 --> 00:38:21,670
sharing lawyer fashion tips and stuff.

886
00:38:23,031 --> 00:38:24,471
(Wang Lu)
He has quite a few fans.

887
00:38:25,311 --> 00:38:25,871
Not bad.

888
00:38:26,630 --> 00:38:27,391
Truly nice.

889
00:38:27,391 --> 00:38:28,471
So getting eliminated

890
00:38:28,471 --> 00:38:29,670
isn't necessarily bad, right?

891
00:38:30,110 --> 00:38:31,230
Look how polished he is now,

892
00:38:31,230 --> 00:38:31,951
and look at us.

893
00:38:32,150 --> 00:38:32,951
Working on proposals

894
00:38:33,471 --> 00:38:35,230
nearly gave us heart attacks.

895
00:38:37,670 --> 00:38:38,471
Where's Yan Fei?

896
00:38:39,031 --> 00:38:40,710
I haven't seen her all afternoon.

897
00:38:40,951 --> 00:38:41,951
Being all mysterious.

898
00:38:42,070 --> 00:38:42,991
Silent in the chat.

899
00:38:43,431 --> 00:38:43,951
Right,

900
00:38:44,230 --> 00:38:45,150
she worked solo

901
00:38:45,150 --> 00:38:46,550
yet submitted her proposal so fast.

902
00:38:46,991 --> 00:38:48,070
How's she that good?

903
00:38:48,270 --> 00:38:49,351
Think about it.

904
00:38:49,710 --> 00:38:51,630
She worked on her proposal from home.

905
00:38:51,871 --> 00:38:52,831
Home. Come on.

906
00:38:53,351 --> 00:38:54,311
Of course she's good.

907
00:38:54,550 --> 00:38:55,590
This elimination

908
00:38:55,590 --> 00:38:57,070
will definitely be among us.

909
00:39:00,956 --> 00:39:05,576
(Theme: Sunday Pro Bono Legal Aid
Sign-up Link)

910
00:39:06,710 --> 00:39:07,270
Will you...

911
00:39:09,871 --> 00:39:10,391
participate?

912
00:39:23,550 --> 00:39:24,136
Hello.

913
00:39:24,471 --> 00:39:26,871
Jiatong, the weather's getting colder.

914
00:39:27,031 --> 00:39:27,791
Dress warmly.

915
00:39:32,070 --> 00:39:33,710
You didn't answer this afternoon.

916
00:39:34,431 --> 00:39:36,670
They called me directly.

917
00:39:37,550 --> 00:39:38,070
Jiatong.

918
00:39:38,550 --> 00:39:39,710
Is everything okay?

919
00:39:41,270 --> 00:39:41,911
Yes.

920
00:39:42,351 --> 00:39:43,791
I was busy and didn't hear it.

921
00:39:46,710 --> 00:39:47,511
About that call,

922
00:39:47,511 --> 00:39:48,991
Lin saw it again.

923
00:39:49,270 --> 00:39:50,391
He gave me another lecture.

924
00:39:51,511 --> 00:39:52,031
Jiatong.

925
00:39:53,871 --> 00:39:55,471
Lin's startup

926
00:39:55,670 --> 00:39:57,471
is having some issues this month.

927
00:39:58,150 --> 00:39:58,710
Could you...?

928
00:39:59,911 --> 00:40:01,150
Could you transfer some

929
00:40:01,391 --> 00:40:02,391
of your salary to me?

930
00:40:03,550 --> 00:40:04,104
Okay.

931
00:40:04,471 --> 00:40:05,070
Later.

932
00:40:18,670 --> 00:40:19,230
Hello?

933
00:40:19,991 --> 00:40:21,511
What are you up to, all secretive?

934
00:40:21,710 --> 00:40:22,710
You didn't even join us.

935
00:40:23,791 --> 00:40:24,511
Nothing.

936
00:40:27,911 --> 00:40:30,431
Jiang Chen specially bought this
and asked me to give it to you.

937
00:40:31,670 --> 00:40:32,471
Now, fess up.

938
00:40:33,110 --> 00:40:34,911
What's up with you two
being all secretive?

939
00:40:36,190 --> 00:40:37,230
It's nothing.

940
00:40:42,150 --> 00:40:43,150
I thought it was Zhubao.

941
00:40:44,311 --> 00:40:45,110
I'm heading back.

942
00:40:45,550 --> 00:40:46,351
Continue later.

943
00:40:46,951 --> 00:40:47,550
You should eat.

944
00:40:48,791 --> 00:40:49,351
Thanks.

945
00:40:49,471 --> 00:40:50,088
Not at all.

946
00:41:19,400 --> 00:41:20,391
(Jiang Chen)
(You okay?)

947
00:41:35,260 --> 00:41:37,096
(Typing...)

948
00:41:39,991 --> 00:41:41,630
The girl's easily embarrassed.

949
00:41:42,471 --> 00:41:43,471
She's ignoring you.

950
00:41:43,911 --> 00:41:45,550
You go to her.

951
00:41:46,523 --> 00:41:47,304
(We killed people.)

952
00:41:47,304 --> 00:41:49,288
(Why keep doubting my love?)

953
00:41:49,670 --> 00:41:50,871
You don't understand girls.

954
00:41:56,351 --> 00:41:58,230
Be proactive. Ask her out.

955
00:41:58,911 --> 00:41:59,550
Wait.

956
00:41:59,550 --> 00:42:01,391
Auntie, you're leaving comments here?

957
00:42:02,150 --> 00:42:04,190
I truly don't understand
you youngsters these days.

958
00:42:04,871 --> 00:42:06,710
I keep seeing people online saying

959
00:42:07,710 --> 00:42:08,871
dating isn't fun

960
00:42:08,871 --> 00:42:09,871
or that it's too hard.

961
00:42:10,351 --> 00:42:11,831
What's so difficult about it?

962
00:42:16,572 --> 00:42:17,480
(Red Envelope)

963
00:42:17,480 --> 00:42:18,920
(I'm fine, thank you.)

964
00:42:19,471 --> 00:42:20,710
No hope for them.

965
00:42:22,511 --> 00:42:23,471
These two

966
00:42:23,951 --> 00:42:24,750
just aren't fated.

967
00:42:28,991 --> 00:42:29,608
Chen.

968
00:42:32,110 --> 00:42:33,190
Are you free tomorrow?

969
00:42:33,991 --> 00:42:35,670
Give your mom a video call.

970
00:42:35,791 --> 00:42:36,670
She misses you deeply.

971
00:42:37,750 --> 00:42:40,031
She called me today saying that.

972
00:42:43,270 --> 00:42:43,951
Actually,

973
00:42:45,070 --> 00:42:46,391
your mother's had it rough.

974
00:42:48,110 --> 00:42:49,190
You were young then

975
00:42:49,831 --> 00:42:51,991
and couldn't understand adult matters.

976
00:42:53,070 --> 00:42:54,630
You're your mother's top priority.

977
00:42:58,831 --> 00:43:00,190
Maybe I don't understand,

978
00:43:01,230 --> 00:43:02,750
but they used to fight every day.

979
00:43:04,471 --> 00:43:05,710
Did they have time left for me?

980
00:43:08,311 --> 00:43:08,968
Going to bed.

981
00:43:09,710 --> 00:43:10,471
Sleep early.

982
00:43:15,548 --> 00:43:17,288
(Commercial Defamation
and Unfair Competition)

983
00:43:17,288 --> 00:43:18,888
(Answer: The Anti-Unfair Competition Law
lists "commercial defamation")

984
00:43:18,888 --> 00:43:20,424
(as unfair competition practice,)

985
00:43:20,424 --> 00:43:22,120
(which stipulates "business operators
shall not fabricate,)

986
00:43:22,120 --> 00:43:24,072
(spread or instruct others to fabricate)

987
00:43:24,072 --> 00:43:25,768
(or disseminate
false or misleading information)

988
00:43:25,768 --> 00:43:27,848
(to damage the commercial reputation
or product image of other businesses.")
