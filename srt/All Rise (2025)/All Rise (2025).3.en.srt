Leaving?

00:02:18,780 --> 00:02:20,100
Are we really going to review

30
00:02:20,579 --> 00:02:21,940
all of this again?

31
00:02:22,419 --> 00:02:24,459
There are so many pages, all in English.

32
00:02:24,980 --> 00:02:26,260
Not planning to sleep tonight?

33
00:02:26,739 --> 00:02:27,299
It's fine.

34
00:02:28,500 --> 00:02:30,100
You should head back. It's late.

35
00:02:32,660 --> 00:02:33,540
No need. I'm staying.

36
00:02:34,060 --> 00:02:34,739
I'll help you

37
00:02:35,940 --> 00:02:37,260
review as much as we can manage.

38
00:02:38,380 --> 00:02:39,100
Guo Xiaoyu,

39
00:02:40,019 --> 00:02:41,060
let me tell you again.

40
00:02:41,739 --> 00:02:43,299
I don't blame you for that video.

41
00:02:43,500 --> 00:02:44,100
Staying awake

42
00:02:44,100 --> 00:02:45,820
and hovering here won't solve anything.

43
00:02:46,340 --> 00:02:47,899
We already submitted the translation.

44
00:02:48,179 --> 00:02:49,220
Your presence here

45
00:02:49,220 --> 00:02:50,780
doesn't seem necessary.

46
00:02:50,780 --> 00:02:51,859
It only moves you.

47
00:02:58,820 --> 00:02:59,579
I understand.

48
00:03:00,780 --> 00:03:02,859
I guess I really can't help much here.

49
00:03:06,139 --> 00:03:07,340
I'll go back.

50
00:03:08,579 --> 00:03:09,459
Go, guys.

51
00:03:44,660 --> 00:03:45,500
Still holding up?

52
00:03:48,139 --> 00:03:48,899
Relax.

53
00:03:49,859 --> 00:03:51,739
I'll outlast you even if you collapse.

54
00:03:54,459 --> 00:03:56,019
Why take this risk with me?

55
00:03:58,820 --> 00:03:59,459
Fine with loss?

56
00:04:00,380 --> 00:04:01,419
This isn't about you.

57
00:04:04,980 --> 00:04:06,579
It's my professional judgment.

58
00:04:09,060 --> 00:04:10,060
Careful, don't burn out.

59
00:04:10,899 --> 00:04:11,820
Speak up if you can't.

60
00:04:15,739 --> 00:04:16,660
I'm back again.

61
00:04:18,340 --> 00:04:20,140
I can't help with document review,

62
00:04:20,379 --> 00:04:21,020
so

63
00:04:21,179 --> 00:04:22,780
I got you snacks and coffee.

64
00:04:22,819 --> 00:04:23,780
Take what you like.

65
00:04:26,580 --> 00:04:27,859
Not sure about your preferences.

66
00:04:28,379 --> 00:04:29,220
Here's coffee.

67
00:04:29,220 --> 00:04:30,619
Hot one for you. It's scalding.

68
00:04:31,140 --> 00:04:31,619
Here.

69
00:04:32,739 --> 00:04:33,179
Thanks.

70
00:04:34,059 --> 00:04:34,739
Don't mention it.

71
00:04:35,220 --> 00:04:35,980
To be clear,

72
00:04:36,220 --> 00:04:37,419
this is my treat.

73
00:04:37,580 --> 00:04:38,819
No transferring money to me.

74
00:04:39,299 --> 00:04:41,460
I'll come early
tomorrow to cover for you.

75
00:04:41,619 --> 00:04:43,499
Grab some shut-eye before returning.

76
00:04:44,259 --> 00:04:46,340
My mom says sleep is non-negotiable.

77
00:04:47,340 --> 00:04:49,460
Skipping sleep makes you dumb, got it?

78
00:04:51,619 --> 00:04:52,059
Leaving.

79
00:04:52,660 --> 00:04:53,419
Go, go!

80
00:04:53,619 --> 00:04:54,059
Thanks.

81
00:04:54,059 --> 00:04:54,819
It's okay. Bye.

82
00:06:40,220 --> 00:06:40,780
I found it.

83
00:06:41,619 --> 00:06:42,340
Jiang Chen, look.

84
00:06:42,819 --> 00:06:43,819
They made a mistake here.

85
00:06:45,419 --> 00:06:46,020
Perfect.

86
00:06:46,819 --> 00:06:47,939
I'll email Mr. Song now.

87
00:07:15,220 --> 00:07:17,020
Why did you suddenly back me yesterday?

88
00:07:18,980 --> 00:07:20,140
Because you said

89
00:07:20,819 --> 00:07:22,900
James is a law firm too.

90
00:07:23,379 --> 00:07:24,220
We're all human.

91
00:07:24,419 --> 00:07:25,419
Humans make mistakes.

92
00:07:29,220 --> 00:07:29,780
Remember

93
00:07:29,780 --> 00:07:31,739
what Mr. Song emphasized
during the briefing?

94
00:07:34,419 --> 00:07:36,220
He specifically stated

95
00:07:36,819 --> 00:07:38,140
that we and James Law Firm

96
00:07:38,140 --> 00:07:40,660
must verify the deal under both domestic

97
00:07:40,739 --> 00:07:42,020
and international law.

98
00:07:42,660 --> 00:07:43,499
If Mr. Song

99
00:07:43,499 --> 00:07:45,100
only wanted a translation,

100
00:07:45,419 --> 00:07:45,980
why explain it

101
00:07:45,980 --> 00:07:47,900
in such detail

102
00:07:49,020 --> 00:07:50,259
and specify

103
00:07:50,580 --> 00:07:52,739
Jun An must conduct
legal verification too?

104
00:07:55,140 --> 00:07:56,859
You also suspect this test

105
00:07:56,859 --> 00:07:58,259
isn't just about translation?

106
00:08:04,739 --> 00:08:06,140
Worried about the Warm Nest matter?

107
00:08:09,700 --> 00:08:10,980
They will announce

108
00:08:10,980 --> 00:08:12,419
their decision on me this morning.

109
00:08:14,179 --> 00:08:15,419
You didn't actually do wrong.

110
00:08:16,179 --> 00:08:17,179
You said "Jun An".

111
00:08:17,179 --> 00:08:18,819
You didn't say you were their lawyer.

112
00:08:19,379 --> 00:08:20,220
If I were you,

113
00:08:20,299 --> 00:08:22,619
I'd go straight to Mr. Zhuang at dawn

114
00:08:22,780 --> 00:08:23,580
to appeal my case.

115
00:08:25,980 --> 00:08:27,179
What's this?

116
00:08:27,939 --> 00:08:29,580
Friendly advice from a rival?

117
00:08:32,300 --> 00:08:33,539
Call it a defense opinion

118
00:08:33,859 --> 00:08:35,739
from the great lawyer from the future

119
00:08:35,739 --> 00:08:37,139
on this case.

120
00:08:43,060 --> 00:08:44,899
We've known each other
for quite some time.

121
00:08:45,739 --> 00:08:47,060
You've never smiled like this.

122
00:08:54,220 --> 00:08:54,980
I'll go this way.

123
00:08:56,659 --> 00:08:57,220
Going that way

124
00:08:57,499 --> 00:08:58,259
for the subway.

125
00:08:59,139 --> 00:09:00,420
Trying to make it home.

126
00:09:00,420 --> 00:09:01,580
Shower and change clothes.

127
00:09:02,100 --> 00:09:02,779
Dawn's breaking.

128
00:09:02,779 --> 00:09:03,899
Should I walk you home?

129
00:09:04,619 --> 00:09:05,739
Don't worry. Thanks.

130
00:09:16,060 --> 00:09:16,820
Ren Jiatong.

131
00:09:19,940 --> 00:09:21,859
If we don't fight for our own rights

132
00:09:21,859 --> 00:09:23,379
and work hard to claim them,

133
00:09:23,820 --> 00:09:25,300
then why are we even lawyers?

134
00:09:26,499 --> 00:09:27,220
Your world

135
00:09:27,259 --> 00:09:28,899
shouldn't only have clients and cases.

136
00:09:29,980 --> 00:09:30,980
Include yourself in it.

137
00:09:32,619 --> 00:09:33,820
Fight for yourself.

138
00:09:58,980 --> 00:09:59,619
Good morning.

139
00:09:59,700 --> 00:09:59,980
Morning.

140
00:10:01,180 --> 00:10:01,779
Good morning.

141
00:10:02,220 --> 00:10:03,340
Lucy, the new receptionist.

142
00:10:03,899 --> 00:10:05,019
This is the coffee for you.

143
00:10:06,420 --> 00:10:06,940
Thank you.

144
00:10:17,940 --> 00:10:18,340
Come in.

145
00:10:22,820 --> 00:10:23,700
Hello, Ms. Bai.

146
00:10:24,060 --> 00:10:26,300
I'm a candidate
in the Talent Hunt Program.

147
00:10:26,300 --> 00:10:26,859
Ren Jiatong.

148
00:10:27,100 --> 00:10:28,019
In the group chat,

149
00:10:28,019 --> 00:10:29,340
I responded to you.

150
00:10:29,619 --> 00:10:30,499
Here's what I compiled

151
00:10:30,499 --> 00:10:32,980
about the medical dispute case.

152
00:10:33,259 --> 00:10:35,139
The digital version
is already in your email.

153
00:10:35,139 --> 00:10:36,259
Hope this helps.

154
00:10:38,779 --> 00:10:39,340
Your name?

155
00:10:39,859 --> 00:10:40,499
Ren Jiatong.

156
00:10:43,940 --> 00:10:45,180
In that Warm Nest video,

157
00:10:45,220 --> 00:10:46,899
you're the one
who caused trouble for us.

158
00:10:49,019 --> 00:10:51,420
So you came to pull strings
through connections?

159
00:10:54,700 --> 00:10:55,580
I just wanted

160
00:10:55,739 --> 00:10:57,379
to demonstrate my work capabilities.

161
00:10:59,460 --> 00:11:00,940
Regarding your retention,

162
00:11:01,060 --> 00:11:02,539
Mr. Zhuang asked for my opinion.

163
00:11:03,820 --> 00:11:05,659
Give me a reason you should stay.

164
00:11:09,539 --> 00:11:11,019
I'll work to the best of my ability.

165
00:11:11,460 --> 00:11:12,980
Or do your best to make mistakes?

166
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:22,280
(Analyze? What responsibility?)

167
00:11:22,280 --> 00:11:24,968
(What obligation? What relationship?)

168
00:11:24,968 --> 00:11:27,368
(Format?)

169
00:11:54,580 --> 00:11:55,619
It's all my fault.

170
00:11:56,060 --> 00:11:57,220
Let me go explain to them.

171
00:11:57,820 --> 00:11:58,899
You can't explain anything.

172
00:11:59,139 --> 00:12:00,580
You have so few followers.

173
00:12:00,820 --> 00:12:02,820
How did those marketing accounts
find the video?

174
00:12:02,899 --> 00:12:04,659
It's probably someone internal.

175
00:12:19,139 --> 00:12:19,659
Mr. Liu.

176
00:12:19,980 --> 00:12:20,259
Speak.

177
00:12:23,539 --> 00:12:23,980
Sorry.

178
00:12:26,499 --> 00:12:26,859
Yes.

179
00:12:28,420 --> 00:12:29,859
Ms. Bai is back from her trip.

180
00:12:30,340 --> 00:12:31,619
She'll attend Friday's meeting.

181
00:12:32,899 --> 00:12:33,259
Alright.

182
00:12:34,019 --> 00:12:34,499
See you Friday.

183
00:12:37,060 --> 00:12:38,220
(Employee's Form, Ren Jiatong)
Mr. Liu came

184
00:12:38,499 --> 00:12:39,859
demanding answers again.

185
00:12:40,460 --> 00:12:40,899
Speak up.

186
00:12:43,499 --> 00:12:44,100
Warm Nest

187
00:12:44,100 --> 00:12:45,980
is a major client
we need to actively pursue.

188
00:12:46,460 --> 00:12:47,859
Previously, Mr. Liu and I spoke,

189
00:12:48,139 --> 00:12:48,980
and he wanted us

190
00:12:49,139 --> 00:12:50,420
to eliminate Ren Jiatong.

191
00:12:51,340 --> 00:12:52,100
In principle,

192
00:12:52,619 --> 00:12:53,940
client interests should be

193
00:12:54,139 --> 00:12:55,460
our top priority.

194
00:12:56,139 --> 00:12:57,940
But ultimately, resolving this

195
00:12:58,220 --> 00:12:59,499
is our internal decision.

196
00:13:00,779 --> 00:13:02,619
How is she performing in the program?

197
00:13:02,659 --> 00:13:03,100
Tell me.

198
00:13:04,899 --> 00:13:06,739
Her assessment results
are excellent so far.

199
00:13:07,100 --> 00:13:08,619
She's an exceptional talent.

200
00:13:09,379 --> 00:13:10,420
Personally,

201
00:13:10,420 --> 00:13:11,779
I really like her.

202
00:13:12,180 --> 00:13:13,180
But her impersonation

203
00:13:13,180 --> 00:13:14,659
of our lawyers

204
00:13:14,659 --> 00:13:16,580
caused severe damage to our reputation.

205
00:13:17,659 --> 00:13:18,659
I saw that video.

206
00:13:19,420 --> 00:13:20,739
She said she was from Jun An

207
00:13:20,739 --> 00:13:22,100
but didn't claim to be our lawyer.

208
00:13:22,659 --> 00:13:23,460
Not a violation.

209
00:13:24,420 --> 00:13:24,899
She...

210
00:13:32,659 --> 00:13:33,259
Let's do this.

211
00:13:33,300 --> 00:13:34,619
We'll flip a coin.

212
00:13:34,779 --> 00:13:36,100
Whoever gets lucky decides.

213
00:13:37,700 --> 00:13:38,139
I agree.

214
00:13:41,100 --> 00:13:41,739
Seriously?

215
00:13:43,619 --> 00:13:44,259
Flipping a coin?

216
00:13:56,820 --> 00:13:57,300
Ma'am.

217
00:13:59,300 --> 00:14:00,739
I filmed that Warm Nest video.

218
00:14:01,100 --> 00:14:02,220
I uploaded it online.

219
00:14:02,220 --> 00:14:03,180
Not Ren Jiatong's fault.

220
00:14:05,139 --> 00:14:05,700
I think

221
00:14:06,420 --> 00:14:08,659
if Jun An eliminates a candidate

222
00:14:08,659 --> 00:14:09,899
just based on a single video,

223
00:14:11,019 --> 00:14:12,100
that would be unfair.

224
00:14:13,859 --> 00:14:14,859
Who told you

225
00:14:14,859 --> 00:14:16,379
that we plan to eliminate Ren Jiatong?

226
00:14:21,340 --> 00:14:22,259
Mr. Zhuang said

227
00:14:22,340 --> 00:14:23,940
Ms. Bai will communicate

228
00:14:23,940 --> 00:14:25,340
with the client for you.

229
00:14:25,619 --> 00:14:27,619
So you'll temporarily
remain in the program.

230
00:14:27,899 --> 00:14:28,940
As for your standing,

231
00:14:29,340 --> 00:14:31,139
we'll decide after the next assessment.

232
00:14:33,700 --> 00:14:34,619
Thank you.

233
00:14:38,899 --> 00:14:39,899
That's good!

234
00:14:40,340 --> 00:14:41,300
That's good!

235
00:14:42,139 --> 00:14:43,499
Good! You get to stay!

236
00:14:46,259 --> 00:14:47,220
Hug me.

237
00:14:49,220 --> 00:14:50,019
Alright, alright.

238
00:14:50,019 --> 00:14:50,899
Stop crying now.

239
00:14:51,340 --> 00:14:52,300
I'm still on probation.

240
00:14:52,859 --> 00:14:53,820
Let's both work harder.

241
00:15:09,259 --> 00:15:09,659
Come in.

242
00:15:12,460 --> 00:15:13,420
Ms. Bai.

243
00:15:13,940 --> 00:15:16,420
Here's your latte.

244
00:15:16,420 --> 00:15:17,259
18g beans extracted

245
00:15:17,259 --> 00:15:18,460
into 25ml espresso,

246
00:15:18,539 --> 00:15:20,940
topped with 180ml whole milk foam,

247
00:15:20,940 --> 00:15:22,379
rested for three minutes.

248
00:15:22,820 --> 00:15:23,779
Perfect temperature now.

249
00:15:24,899 --> 00:15:26,619
You've quickly figured out
my preferences.

250
00:15:29,899 --> 00:15:31,499
But you didn't come here to make coffee.

251
00:15:31,779 --> 00:15:32,820
I don't support

252
00:15:32,820 --> 00:15:34,460
newcomers developing such habits.

253
00:15:36,340 --> 00:15:37,940
I took the liberty of making this

254
00:15:38,019 --> 00:15:39,340
just to express my gratitude.

255
00:15:39,779 --> 00:15:40,980
How did you determine

256
00:15:41,220 --> 00:15:42,379
my taste preferences?

257
00:15:43,139 --> 00:15:45,060
Duoduo left notes on the fridge.

258
00:15:45,580 --> 00:15:47,259
Observation and gathering information

259
00:15:47,340 --> 00:15:48,739
are fundamental for lawyers.

260
00:15:49,100 --> 00:15:49,859
Lawyer?

261
00:15:50,899 --> 00:15:52,180
Are you sure you'll get to stay?

262
00:15:52,779 --> 00:15:53,420
I'm not certain,

263
00:15:54,460 --> 00:15:55,820
but I believe in my capabilities

264
00:15:56,739 --> 00:15:58,259
and your judgment, Ms. Bai.

265
00:15:59,420 --> 00:16:00,619
You think I favor you?

266
00:16:01,499 --> 00:16:02,899
You're still provisional.

267
00:16:04,100 --> 00:16:06,139
Truthfully, I don't care
who stays or leaves.

268
00:16:07,019 --> 00:16:07,820
But so far,

269
00:16:07,820 --> 00:16:08,980
you've been doing alright.

270
00:16:10,340 --> 00:16:12,659
I'm confident I won't disappoint you.

271
00:16:13,259 --> 00:16:15,539
This document
incorporates your revisions.

272
00:16:17,019 --> 00:16:17,980
Don't be overconfident.

273
00:16:17,980 --> 00:16:18,700
Many newcomers

274
00:16:18,700 --> 00:16:20,340
have made similar claims before.

275
00:16:20,820 --> 00:16:22,180
Prove you can last first.

276
00:16:23,580 --> 00:16:24,379
But I can see

277
00:16:24,379 --> 00:16:26,180
you do have more practical experience

278
00:16:26,180 --> 00:16:27,539
than other candidates.

279
00:16:28,420 --> 00:16:29,379
But that's all.

280
00:16:30,859 --> 00:16:32,779
Then I'll change your mind soon.

281
00:16:33,859 --> 00:16:34,300
Is that so?

282
00:16:36,180 --> 00:16:37,300
Book the meeting room

283
00:16:37,340 --> 00:16:38,499
for a meeting in 15 minutes.

284
00:16:39,340 --> 00:16:39,859
No problem.

285
00:16:45,580 --> 00:16:46,060
Mr. Song.

286
00:16:48,259 --> 00:16:48,700
Go ahead.

287
00:16:56,779 --> 00:16:57,139
Enter.

288
00:17:01,340 --> 00:17:02,580
Just be direct.

289
00:17:03,340 --> 00:17:04,940
Don't pretend it's about her competence.

290
00:17:05,940 --> 00:17:06,980
Who buys this excuse?

291
00:17:08,940 --> 00:17:10,579
This coffee still misses the mark.

292
00:17:12,700 --> 00:17:13,620
You talk tough

293
00:17:13,620 --> 00:17:14,980
but act soft.

294
00:17:15,700 --> 00:17:17,099
You're a renowned lawyer.

295
00:17:17,099 --> 00:17:18,140
Must you constantly

296
00:17:18,140 --> 00:17:19,620
use internet slang?

297
00:17:20,180 --> 00:17:21,739
Focus on legal terminology

298
00:17:21,779 --> 00:17:23,019
and secure more clients

299
00:17:23,059 --> 00:17:24,539
to sustain our department.

300
00:17:25,140 --> 00:17:26,180
I'm exhausted.

301
00:17:27,099 --> 00:17:27,579
Fine then.

302
00:17:28,140 --> 00:17:29,539
Let's have a proper lunch together.

303
00:17:29,739 --> 00:17:30,019
Agreed?

304
00:17:30,380 --> 00:17:30,779
No need.

305
00:17:31,380 --> 00:17:32,460
I have a meeting shortly.

306
00:17:33,779 --> 00:17:35,339
But you need to eat.

307
00:17:36,019 --> 00:17:36,499
Let me pack

308
00:17:36,499 --> 00:17:37,180
food for you.

309
00:17:37,180 --> 00:17:38,059
Are you free tonight?

310
00:17:38,940 --> 00:17:41,259
I have dinner plans with Niuniu.

311
00:17:41,539 --> 00:17:42,019
Another day.

312
00:17:42,420 --> 00:17:43,220
Another day again?

313
00:17:44,460 --> 00:17:45,819
Give me a concrete date.

314
00:17:46,579 --> 00:17:47,180
Your treat.

315
00:17:47,539 --> 00:17:48,380
I'll pay. Deal?

316
00:17:49,019 --> 00:17:49,380
Deal.

317
00:17:51,499 --> 00:17:51,940
Sometime.

318
00:18:09,019 --> 00:18:10,299
(Huang Yue)
(I'm jealous.)

319
00:18:10,579 --> 00:18:11,380
(But she stayed.)

320
00:18:11,579 --> 00:18:12,620
(I felt relieved.)

321
00:18:12,739 --> 00:18:13,819
(My older guy)
(Naive.)

322
00:18:14,460 --> 00:18:16,220
(For adults, it's just
wins and interests.)

323
00:18:16,700 --> 00:18:17,140
(Huang Yue)
(Yeah?)

324
00:18:17,539 --> 00:18:18,499
(Then between us,)

325
00:18:18,499 --> 00:18:19,460
(who wins?)

326
00:18:19,700 --> 00:18:20,940
(My older guy)
(Not over yet?)

327
00:18:21,499 --> 00:18:21,860
(Right.)

328
00:18:22,140 --> 00:18:23,579
(That bag you said you liked.)

329
00:18:23,860 --> 00:18:24,579
(Let's go buy it.)

330
00:18:24,940 --> 00:18:25,579
(Huang Yue)
(No.)

331
00:18:25,779 --> 00:18:27,739
(What I'm interested in now is winning.)

332
00:18:31,819 --> 00:18:32,460
That's great.

333
00:18:33,779 --> 00:18:34,380
That's great.

334
00:18:42,779 --> 00:18:43,660
I expected

335
00:18:44,140 --> 00:18:45,259
to have one less competitor.

336
00:18:46,059 --> 00:18:47,059
But now,

337
00:18:47,460 --> 00:18:48,539
she jumped ahead.

338
00:18:49,620 --> 00:18:51,299
Both Mr. Zhuang
and Ms. Bai supported her.

339
00:18:51,656 --> 00:18:53,339
Mr. Zhuang considered
the bigger picture,

340
00:18:53,339 --> 00:18:54,220
preserving

341
00:18:54,220 --> 00:18:55,620
the firm's inclusive culture

342
00:18:55,900 --> 00:18:57,299
and protecting the program.

343
00:18:57,660 --> 00:18:58,299
As for Ms. Bai,

344
00:18:58,579 --> 00:18:59,380
I'm not so sure.

345
00:19:01,620 --> 00:19:03,860
Do you think
Ren Jiatong has connections?

346
00:19:04,980 --> 00:19:06,180
I heard she couldn't even

347
00:19:06,779 --> 00:19:08,180
pass the probation assessment

348
00:19:08,180 --> 00:19:09,539
at Yingtai Law Firm before.

349
00:19:10,539 --> 00:19:12,099
But now at our place,

350
00:19:13,620 --> 00:19:15,019
they're cherishing a castoff.

351
00:19:20,739 --> 00:19:22,700
Stop talking
about Ren Jiatong like that.

352
00:19:24,259 --> 00:19:25,579
She's genuinely competent.

353
00:19:25,579 --> 00:19:26,779
That's obvious to everyone.

354
00:19:26,860 --> 00:19:27,900
Why can't they keep her?

355
00:19:31,380 --> 00:19:33,019
Besides, we're all here by fate,

356
00:19:33,019 --> 00:19:33,940
working together,

357
00:19:34,339 --> 00:19:35,620
so we should be friends.

358
00:19:36,059 --> 00:19:36,660
Friends?

359
00:19:37,579 --> 00:19:38,539
If I recall correctly,

360
00:19:38,620 --> 00:19:40,339
you filmed that video of Ren Jiatong.

361
00:19:41,739 --> 00:19:43,140
I... I didn't...

362
00:19:43,380 --> 00:19:43,860
Wait.

363
00:19:44,460 --> 00:19:46,980
What's impressive
about picking on a girl?

364
00:19:47,140 --> 00:19:48,900
If you want to win,
rely on your own skills.

365
00:20:05,860 --> 00:20:06,460
Yan Fei,

366
00:20:08,620 --> 00:20:09,579
thanks for earlier.

367
00:20:11,579 --> 00:20:12,779
I'm a coward.

368
00:20:13,140 --> 00:20:15,980
My mom always says
I seem quick-witted normally,

369
00:20:16,299 --> 00:20:18,420
but my brain freezes at crucial moments.

370
00:20:18,620 --> 00:20:19,499
When I look back,

371
00:20:19,980 --> 00:20:20,779
no,

372
00:20:20,779 --> 00:20:22,620
I should've said this.

373
00:20:23,099 --> 00:20:23,940
Brilliant comebacks

374
00:20:23,940 --> 00:20:24,860
stack up.

375
00:20:25,339 --> 00:20:26,539
But when the moment arrives,

376
00:20:26,579 --> 00:20:28,099
I just can't articulate it.

377
00:20:28,739 --> 00:20:29,460
I noticed.

378
00:20:29,819 --> 00:20:32,259
You played the nice guy helping
Huang Yue translate, right?

379
00:20:32,660 --> 00:20:33,299
How do you know?

380
00:20:33,940 --> 00:20:35,579
I could tell from both your expressions.

381
00:20:35,579 --> 00:20:36,339
I'm not blind.

382
00:20:37,140 --> 00:20:38,539
You think this is still school?

383
00:20:38,539 --> 00:20:40,019
Passing notes to your desk neighbor?

384
00:20:40,380 --> 00:20:41,579
Do you even want to stay here?

385
00:20:44,059 --> 00:20:45,819
My boyfriend kept discouraging me,

386
00:20:46,180 --> 00:20:48,259
saying I wouldn't last
three days in Beijing.

387
00:20:48,620 --> 00:20:50,059
I've survived so far,

388
00:20:50,380 --> 00:20:51,299
but on my first day,

389
00:20:51,299 --> 00:20:52,779
that Warm Nest matter occurred.

390
00:20:53,420 --> 00:20:55,579
I still haven't had time
to find a place to live.

391
00:20:56,099 --> 00:20:57,579
Staying in a budget hotel every day.

392
00:20:57,940 --> 00:20:59,339
My deposit hasn't been refunded,

393
00:20:59,700 --> 00:21:01,339
and that hotel costs hundreds daily.

394
00:21:01,539 --> 00:21:03,180
Swiping my credit card is killing me.

395
00:21:04,660 --> 00:21:05,779
As for my family,

396
00:21:05,860 --> 00:21:06,940
we're doing okay.

397
00:21:07,099 --> 00:21:09,420
Though my parents pretend to support me,

398
00:21:09,660 --> 00:21:10,339
deep down,

399
00:21:10,660 --> 00:21:12,380
they never want me to work in Beijing.

400
00:21:12,779 --> 00:21:13,860
So I haven't told them

401
00:21:13,860 --> 00:21:14,980
about this thing.

402
00:21:15,140 --> 00:21:16,539
Afraid they'd seize the opportunity

403
00:21:16,539 --> 00:21:16,940
to say,

404
00:21:17,380 --> 00:21:18,339
"Just come home."

405
00:21:20,140 --> 00:21:20,779
And your family?

406
00:21:22,940 --> 00:21:23,700
Mine...

407
00:21:24,660 --> 00:21:25,980
Just regular business people.

408
00:21:27,940 --> 00:21:28,339
Okay.

409
00:21:29,059 --> 00:21:29,819
Let's work hard

410
00:21:29,900 --> 00:21:30,700
and get to stay.

411
00:21:30,860 --> 00:21:31,900
After payday at month-end,

412
00:21:32,140 --> 00:21:33,299
we won't need their money.

413
00:21:35,779 --> 00:21:37,059
Didn't you ask Ren Jiatong?

414
00:21:37,220 --> 00:21:38,860
You both faced the same situation.

415
00:21:38,900 --> 00:21:39,779
How did she handle it?

416
00:21:40,140 --> 00:21:40,790
I did.

417
00:21:40,790 --> 00:21:42,259
She just said

418
00:21:42,259 --> 00:21:43,739
she found the landlord on the spot.

419
00:21:44,059 --> 00:21:44,900
She said to pay more.

420
00:21:45,220 --> 00:21:46,019
And they agreed

421
00:21:46,019 --> 00:21:47,739
to keep renting the apartment to her.

422
00:21:48,019 --> 00:21:50,099
Aren't you going
to contact the landlord?

423
00:21:51,259 --> 00:21:51,900
I...

424
00:21:54,940 --> 00:21:56,339
I feel like I probably won't

425
00:21:56,579 --> 00:21:57,660
even last a month here.

426
00:21:59,140 --> 00:22:01,140
All of you are way too impressive.

427
00:22:02,019 --> 00:22:02,779
I used to think

428
00:22:03,539 --> 00:22:04,499
back in my hometown,

429
00:22:04,499 --> 00:22:06,259
I'd at least stand out as exceptional.

430
00:22:07,059 --> 00:22:08,460
But after coming to Jun An,

431
00:22:09,220 --> 00:22:10,660
I'm just a nobody.

432
00:22:12,660 --> 00:22:13,900
Why do you think Jun An

433
00:22:13,900 --> 00:22:15,579
hired someone like you?

434
00:22:16,499 --> 00:22:17,539
Among our group,

435
00:22:17,539 --> 00:22:18,620
you're the youngest.

436
00:22:18,860 --> 00:22:20,259
No overseas education,

437
00:22:20,380 --> 00:22:21,819
not from top law schools,

438
00:22:22,579 --> 00:22:23,860
average family background,

439
00:22:24,019 --> 00:22:25,620
no social media influence.

440
00:22:26,180 --> 00:22:27,099
Why'd they pick you?

441
00:22:30,299 --> 00:22:31,579
Last time, you ranked higher

442
00:22:31,579 --> 00:22:32,980
than us from foreign universities

443
00:22:32,980 --> 00:22:34,779
and top Chinese law universities.

444
00:22:35,460 --> 00:22:37,779
So you're saying
Mr. Song and others are blind,

445
00:22:37,819 --> 00:22:40,059
or that we're just mediocre?

446
00:22:42,499 --> 00:22:43,700
Master Yan,

447
00:22:44,339 --> 00:22:46,099
you minored in psychology, right?

448
00:22:47,299 --> 00:22:48,900
I must film an ad for you someday

449
00:22:49,539 --> 00:22:50,940
with the tagline,

450
00:22:51,339 --> 00:22:54,259
"Cure workplace blues in one move,"

451
00:22:54,420 --> 00:22:56,779
"consult Master Yan from Jun An."

452
00:22:57,860 --> 00:22:59,700
Your boyfriend hit the jackpot.

453
00:22:59,700 --> 00:23:00,739
Dating you means getting

454
00:23:00,739 --> 00:23:02,059
a free psychological counselor.

455
00:23:03,019 --> 00:23:03,700
I'm single.

456
00:23:05,779 --> 00:23:06,660
You're single?

457
00:23:07,620 --> 00:23:09,900
How come such
a smart, pretty woman is still single?

458
00:23:10,779 --> 00:23:12,739
Are all those guys blind or what?

459
00:23:13,700 --> 00:23:14,420
Then again,

460
00:23:14,819 --> 00:23:16,380
someone as clever and gorgeous as you

461
00:23:16,779 --> 00:23:18,539
must have sky-high standards for men.

462
00:23:19,460 --> 00:23:20,980
I have just one criterion.

463
00:23:22,299 --> 00:23:23,499
No male lawyer.

464
00:23:26,299 --> 00:23:27,059
Meaning?

465
00:23:27,940 --> 00:23:28,739
Bad past experience?

466
00:23:30,059 --> 00:23:30,819
How do I put it?

467
00:23:31,420 --> 00:23:32,420
Male lawyers

468
00:23:33,579 --> 00:23:34,579
are too calculating.

469
00:23:39,180 --> 00:23:39,900
IYKYK.

470
00:23:41,339 --> 00:23:41,900
Meaning?

471
00:23:43,499 --> 00:23:44,499
If you know, you know.

472
00:23:51,739 --> 00:23:52,299
Excuse me.

473
00:24:13,900 --> 00:24:14,460
What's wrong?

474
00:24:21,860 --> 00:24:22,940
Not bad.

475
00:24:23,660 --> 00:24:24,460
Already befriending

476
00:24:24,460 --> 00:24:26,779
the heiress of Xingke Group?

477
00:24:27,900 --> 00:24:29,299
What's Xingke?

478
00:24:29,620 --> 00:24:30,579
Xingke Group,

479
00:24:30,819 --> 00:24:32,059
a private enterprise star

480
00:24:32,059 --> 00:24:33,499
that rose from the 90s Zhongguancun.

481
00:24:33,499 --> 00:24:34,460
Don't play dumb.

482
00:24:38,380 --> 00:24:39,860
The former chairman was surnamed Yan.

483
00:24:40,259 --> 00:24:41,059
The current CEO

484
00:24:41,059 --> 00:24:43,299
is the chairman's biological son,
Yan Da.

485
00:24:43,739 --> 00:24:44,860
He has a sister

486
00:24:44,900 --> 00:24:46,019
named Yan Fei.

487
00:24:46,499 --> 00:24:47,819
Rumored to go abroad years ago.

488
00:24:48,700 --> 00:24:49,819
If I'm right,

489
00:24:50,220 --> 00:24:51,660
your new friend

490
00:24:52,059 --> 00:24:54,380
is the precious daughter
of Xingke Group's boss.

491
00:24:56,499 --> 00:24:57,860
Must be nice having family wealth.

492
00:24:58,620 --> 00:25:00,779
No need to kill yourself competing

493
00:25:01,180 --> 00:25:02,739
for a single job offer like us.

494
00:25:03,860 --> 00:25:05,180
See the bag she carried days ago?

495
00:25:06,099 --> 00:25:07,660
It costs about 100 times more

496
00:25:07,739 --> 00:25:08,860
than both our bags combined.

497
00:25:10,779 --> 00:25:11,539
Being her friend

498
00:25:11,539 --> 00:25:12,579
shows you're no fool.

499
00:25:13,700 --> 00:25:14,980
Maybe she'll get you hired too

500
00:25:15,299 --> 00:25:15,940
if she's happy.

501
00:25:16,499 --> 00:25:17,779
Nonsense. I didn't.

502
00:25:17,779 --> 00:25:19,099
I had no idea who she was.

503
00:25:30,259 --> 00:25:30,819
What's it?

504
00:25:30,819 --> 00:25:31,460
I'm working.

505
00:25:31,739 --> 00:25:32,739
Keep Saturday noon free.

506
00:25:33,259 --> 00:25:34,099
To meet someone.

507
00:25:35,019 --> 00:25:35,620
I'm busy.

508
00:25:36,700 --> 00:25:38,259
Didn't you say last night

509
00:25:38,339 --> 00:25:39,579
some people at your firm

510
00:25:39,579 --> 00:25:40,779
started assisting the seniors?

511
00:25:40,980 --> 00:25:42,099
You shouldn't fall behind.

512
00:25:42,620 --> 00:25:44,579
Cut the crap. Get to the point.

513
00:25:47,460 --> 00:25:48,620
If you bring in clients,

514
00:25:48,980 --> 00:25:50,380
they will fight to mentor you.

515
00:25:52,779 --> 00:25:53,900
Saturday noon works.

516
00:25:54,099 --> 00:25:54,940
Send me the address.

517
00:25:57,140 --> 00:25:57,620
1:30 PM.

518
00:25:57,620 --> 00:25:58,779
Back to work. Bye.

519
00:25:59,620 --> 00:25:59,980
Bye.

520
00:26:11,700 --> 00:26:12,339
What's going on?

521
00:26:12,339 --> 00:26:13,019
Where are they?

522
00:26:15,819 --> 00:26:17,900
Mr. Zhou told us to go
to the conference room.

523
00:26:18,339 --> 00:26:19,220
They've already gone.

524
00:26:34,420 --> 00:26:36,019
Seems you guys stayed up late last night

525
00:26:36,099 --> 00:26:37,019
for the translations.

526
00:26:38,220 --> 00:26:39,380
The translations were good.

527
00:26:40,299 --> 00:26:41,460
Ren Jiatong, Jiang Chen,

528
00:26:42,059 --> 00:26:43,099
I received your email.

529
00:26:43,460 --> 00:26:43,900
Well done.

530
00:26:46,700 --> 00:26:48,019
Now, I'd like to ask everyone.

531
00:26:48,660 --> 00:26:49,380
What do you think

532
00:26:49,460 --> 00:26:51,059
is the objective of this round

533
00:26:51,299 --> 00:26:51,940
of assessment?

534
00:26:52,940 --> 00:26:54,220
Isn't it legal English?

535
00:26:56,499 --> 00:26:58,339
Those who want to be lawyers,
raise your hand.

536
00:27:05,620 --> 00:27:06,019
Good.

537
00:27:06,819 --> 00:27:07,700
Everyone here,

538
00:27:07,819 --> 00:27:08,900
you stood out among many

539
00:27:08,980 --> 00:27:10,220
to enter our program.

540
00:27:11,019 --> 00:27:12,620
If we only gave you a translation test,

541
00:27:12,940 --> 00:27:14,860
it would underestimate all of you.

542
00:27:19,700 --> 00:27:21,099
You know the document has an issue.

543
00:27:22,579 --> 00:27:22,980
Right.

544
00:27:23,660 --> 00:27:24,620
This assessment

545
00:27:24,900 --> 00:27:26,220
is actually based on

546
00:27:26,220 --> 00:27:27,940
the real case-handling experience

547
00:27:27,940 --> 00:27:28,739
of Mr. Song.

548
00:27:29,380 --> 00:27:31,339
When he received
this document back then,

549
00:27:31,499 --> 00:27:32,980
he quickly discovered the flaw.

550
00:27:33,499 --> 00:27:34,579
At once, he communicated

551
00:27:34,980 --> 00:27:35,660
with the client

552
00:27:35,980 --> 00:27:37,700
and the opposing law firm
about the issue

553
00:27:37,900 --> 00:27:39,620
and asked for the original document.

554
00:27:39,940 --> 00:27:40,380
Of course,

555
00:27:40,900 --> 00:27:42,860
the final result left
the client very satisfied.

556
00:27:43,339 --> 00:27:44,620
They renewed their agreement

557
00:27:44,940 --> 00:27:47,059
with Jun An the following year.

558
00:27:47,539 --> 00:27:49,099
After acquiring Kern Company,

559
00:27:49,420 --> 00:27:50,140
they hired Jun An

560
00:27:50,460 --> 00:27:52,299
to handle the legal advisory work

561
00:27:52,299 --> 00:27:54,499
for Kern Company's projects
in mainland China.

562
00:27:56,900 --> 00:27:59,180
So Mr. Song, you set this task

563
00:27:59,739 --> 00:28:00,700
to test whether we are

564
00:28:00,700 --> 00:28:02,779
just doing translation work by rote

565
00:28:03,220 --> 00:28:04,900
or thinking like a professional lawyer.

566
00:28:05,579 --> 00:28:05,980
Exactly.

567
00:28:09,019 --> 00:28:10,019
Impressive.

568
00:28:10,779 --> 00:28:12,099
I'd like to ask a question.

569
00:28:12,980 --> 00:28:14,339
Last night, while you were

570
00:28:14,819 --> 00:28:16,940
busy translating
these original documents,

571
00:28:16,940 --> 00:28:17,940
did anyone think

572
00:28:18,259 --> 00:28:19,059
to come and discuss

573
00:28:19,579 --> 00:28:21,220
with me or Mr. Zhou?

574
00:28:22,420 --> 00:28:22,779
Did you?

575
00:28:27,339 --> 00:28:28,579
We mainly just

576
00:28:29,019 --> 00:28:31,019
didn't want to disturb
you or Mr. Zhou's rest.

577
00:28:31,539 --> 00:28:32,019
Mr. Song.

578
00:28:32,499 --> 00:28:33,539
- It's...
- It's my fault.

579
00:28:36,980 --> 00:28:38,499
Checking the original files was right.

580
00:28:40,499 --> 00:28:42,019
Considering the client is good.

581
00:28:42,860 --> 00:28:43,940
But you have forgotten

582
00:28:43,940 --> 00:28:44,779
the crucial point,

583
00:28:46,259 --> 00:28:47,860
which is feedback and communication.

584
00:28:48,460 --> 00:28:49,660
Since the duty of this case

585
00:28:49,819 --> 00:28:51,140
lies with your supervisor,

586
00:28:51,700 --> 00:28:53,339
all decisions regarding the case

587
00:28:53,579 --> 00:28:54,700
should be made by him.

588
00:28:55,660 --> 00:28:57,220
It's rights matching responsibilities.

589
00:28:57,900 --> 00:28:59,180
You're all law school graduates,

590
00:28:59,180 --> 00:28:59,660
so you know

591
00:29:00,259 --> 00:29:01,140
this point.

592
00:29:04,499 --> 00:29:05,980
At the time, we just wanted

593
00:29:05,980 --> 00:29:07,819
to resolve the issue ourselves.

594
00:29:08,019 --> 00:29:09,259
But did you consider

595
00:29:09,739 --> 00:29:10,940
whether the judgment you made

596
00:29:11,019 --> 00:29:12,099
was necessarily correct?

597
00:29:13,259 --> 00:29:14,259
You're all new to this

598
00:29:14,779 --> 00:29:15,779
without much experience.

599
00:29:16,620 --> 00:29:19,259
There's a risk of error
in your judgments.

600
00:29:20,819 --> 00:29:22,019
So the safest way

601
00:29:22,460 --> 00:29:23,019
was to report

602
00:29:23,779 --> 00:29:24,220
this matter

603
00:29:24,819 --> 00:29:25,819
to me and Mr. Zhou.

604
00:29:26,220 --> 00:29:28,220
Then we could
communicate with the client

605
00:29:28,980 --> 00:29:30,579
to get the original files for review.

606
00:29:33,620 --> 00:29:34,620
Unfortunately,

607
00:29:35,579 --> 00:29:36,579
I waited all night.

608
00:29:38,380 --> 00:29:39,220
Not a single person

609
00:29:39,499 --> 00:29:40,339
texted me

610
00:29:40,980 --> 00:29:41,860
to discuss this.

611
00:29:43,339 --> 00:29:44,539
From what you just said,

612
00:29:45,019 --> 00:29:47,259
there are even issues
with your internal communication.

613
00:29:47,900 --> 00:29:48,579
And this is

614
00:29:49,259 --> 00:29:51,539
precisely the core content and objective

615
00:29:51,980 --> 00:29:52,700
of this round.

616
00:29:55,620 --> 00:29:56,140
Sorry.

617
00:29:56,900 --> 00:29:57,700
For this round,

618
00:29:58,980 --> 00:29:59,700
everyone is zero.

619
00:30:09,819 --> 00:30:11,499
No changes
to the current round of scores.

620
00:30:12,059 --> 00:30:12,980
Also, a reminder.

621
00:30:13,099 --> 00:30:15,420
The first round of the program
will conclude shortly.

622
00:30:15,900 --> 00:30:16,860
Push yourselves harder.

623
00:30:21,736 --> 00:30:22,536
(Talent Hunt Program Scoreboard
Second Assessment of the First Round)

624
00:30:22,536 --> 00:30:24,360
(Jiang Chen 30, Ren Jiatong 30,
Guo Xiaoyu 20, Wang Lu 10)

625
00:30:24,360 --> 00:30:26,248
(Yan Fei 0, Li Ke 0, Huang Yue 0)

626
00:30:26,739 --> 00:30:29,220
After work, go home and get rest.

627
00:30:29,779 --> 00:30:30,739
Think about

628
00:30:31,499 --> 00:30:32,299
your weekend plans.

629
00:30:32,980 --> 00:30:34,140
Life isn't all about work.

630
00:30:35,779 --> 00:30:37,059
There is much other fun.

631
00:30:38,940 --> 00:30:40,259
Jun An is a law firm,

632
00:30:40,299 --> 00:30:41,140
not a sweatshop.

633
00:30:41,779 --> 00:30:42,860
The work will end,

634
00:30:43,420 --> 00:30:44,900
nor should you handle it all alone.

635
00:30:47,620 --> 00:30:47,940
Come in.

636
00:30:49,299 --> 00:30:49,660
Mr. Song.

637
00:30:49,980 --> 00:30:50,779
Have a seat.

638
00:30:55,700 --> 00:30:57,140
Mr. Song, I'll go out.

639
00:30:57,660 --> 00:30:58,739
About the pending matter,

640
00:30:59,779 --> 00:31:00,380
don't stress.

641
00:31:00,779 --> 00:31:01,739
You didn't perform well,

642
00:31:02,180 --> 00:31:03,019
but try again later.

643
00:31:04,180 --> 00:31:05,019
Admit your fatigue.

644
00:31:05,180 --> 00:31:05,940
Ask for help.

645
00:31:06,460 --> 00:31:07,499
Work-life balance.

646
00:31:08,579 --> 00:31:10,259
Don't abuse your youth
with overexertion.

647
00:31:11,180 --> 00:31:11,620
Remember?

648
00:31:14,259 --> 00:31:14,980
Give it to me.

649
00:31:25,620 --> 00:31:26,099
Drink tea?

650
00:31:26,620 --> 00:31:26,980
Alright.

651
00:31:27,660 --> 00:31:28,460
My tea is decent.

652
00:31:28,980 --> 00:31:31,299
It won't keep you awake at night.

653
00:31:32,539 --> 00:31:33,140
Here, try it.

654
00:31:33,620 --> 00:31:34,180
Thank you.

655
00:31:38,140 --> 00:31:40,339
I'd like to discuss my last assessment.

656
00:31:41,900 --> 00:31:43,940
Actually, when I was
studying abroad, I realized

657
00:31:44,299 --> 00:31:46,220
China had moved fast
over the past two decades.

658
00:31:46,579 --> 00:31:47,779
Especially in legal services.

659
00:31:48,339 --> 00:31:49,980
It's moved beyond the small-scale firms

660
00:31:49,980 --> 00:31:51,739
from my father's generation.

661
00:31:52,059 --> 00:31:53,940
Red Circle Firms like Jun An

662
00:31:54,339 --> 00:31:55,420
are now steadily moving

663
00:31:55,460 --> 00:31:56,620
and surpassing foreign firms.

664
00:31:57,420 --> 00:31:58,380
I think your success

665
00:31:58,620 --> 00:31:59,339
in "killing" James

666
00:31:59,339 --> 00:32:00,660
and securing the client

667
00:32:00,980 --> 00:32:02,099
is the best proof.

668
00:32:03,420 --> 00:32:04,339
I didn't kill anyone.

669
00:32:04,739 --> 00:32:05,539
You make me nervous.

670
00:32:06,059 --> 00:32:06,980
I might need a lawyer.

671
00:32:09,140 --> 00:32:09,900
All along,

672
00:32:10,059 --> 00:32:11,620
no matter how much my dad opposes me,

673
00:32:12,380 --> 00:32:13,739
I've had only one goal,

674
00:32:14,180 --> 00:32:15,460
to become an excellent lawyer.

675
00:32:16,819 --> 00:32:18,259
That's why I want to take on

676
00:32:18,579 --> 00:32:20,259
more challenging cases like Ren Jiatong.

677
00:32:23,940 --> 00:32:24,339
Mr. Song,

678
00:32:26,140 --> 00:32:27,539
I really want to work with you.

679
00:32:31,259 --> 00:32:32,059
You mentioned

680
00:32:32,620 --> 00:32:33,539
your dad was a lawyer?

681
00:32:35,980 --> 00:32:36,460
He...

682
00:32:37,539 --> 00:32:39,059
He's a local lawyer in our hometown.

683
00:32:41,299 --> 00:32:42,579
I appreciate and admire

684
00:32:43,460 --> 00:32:44,099
your confidence.

685
00:32:45,499 --> 00:32:46,380
Ren earned her tasks

686
00:32:46,380 --> 00:32:47,539
by negotiating with Ms. Bai.

687
00:32:48,420 --> 00:32:49,499
You could try.

688
00:32:51,380 --> 00:32:52,620
I'll be posting upcoming tasks

689
00:32:52,620 --> 00:32:53,499
in the group chat,

690
00:32:54,980 --> 00:32:55,579
but

691
00:32:56,380 --> 00:32:57,259
here's a suggestion.

692
00:32:58,380 --> 00:32:59,099
From what I know,

693
00:32:59,819 --> 00:33:01,259
Ren Jiatong is currently

694
00:33:01,259 --> 00:33:02,059
overloaded.

695
00:33:03,420 --> 00:33:04,180
Would you like

696
00:33:05,620 --> 00:33:06,620
to collaborate with her?

697
00:33:22,539 --> 00:33:23,019
Enter.

698
00:33:25,620 --> 00:33:27,460
Didn't you say
you'd be home with your kid?

699
00:33:28,140 --> 00:33:29,299
Why are you still here?

700
00:33:29,579 --> 00:33:30,380
I was about to leave

701
00:33:30,380 --> 00:33:31,620
when a client called.

702
00:33:31,860 --> 00:33:32,779
An hour of talking.

703
00:33:32,779 --> 00:33:34,420
My throat's practically burning.

704
00:33:34,940 --> 00:33:36,700
I told the interns this afternoon

705
00:33:36,860 --> 00:33:37,860
to leave on time

706
00:33:37,900 --> 00:33:38,779
and go straight home.

707
00:33:39,099 --> 00:33:40,380
Shouldn't their mentoring lawyer

708
00:33:40,739 --> 00:33:42,099
lead by example?

709
00:33:43,499 --> 00:33:44,819
What's this? Are you becoming

710
00:33:44,819 --> 00:33:46,499
their "Agony Aunt" now?

711
00:33:47,900 --> 00:33:49,499
Or did the assessment results

712
00:33:50,180 --> 00:33:51,019
break someone?

713
00:33:51,700 --> 00:33:52,499
You're wrong.

714
00:33:53,299 --> 00:33:54,940
They're all competing for more tasks.

715
00:33:56,019 --> 00:33:56,819
Online, people say

716
00:33:56,819 --> 00:33:58,420
young people embrace slacking off,

717
00:33:58,940 --> 00:33:59,860
but I think it's wrong.

718
00:34:00,220 --> 00:34:01,259
They're all so driven.

719
00:34:01,579 --> 00:34:03,420
Way better than we were.

720
00:34:04,660 --> 00:34:05,539
Be more precise.

721
00:34:06,259 --> 00:34:07,539
Not "we".

722
00:34:09,460 --> 00:34:09,820
You...

723
00:34:09,820 --> 00:34:11,499
But this could be good for them.

724
00:34:12,019 --> 00:34:13,139
At their age,

725
00:34:13,139 --> 00:34:14,340
learning to cooperate

726
00:34:14,460 --> 00:34:15,699
is harder than competition.

727
00:34:16,900 --> 00:34:17,340
True.

728
00:34:18,260 --> 00:34:19,099
We battled every day

729
00:34:19,300 --> 00:34:19,980
back then.

730
00:34:21,619 --> 00:34:22,460
It wasn't a battle.

731
00:34:22,860 --> 00:34:24,539
You were just losing to me every day.

732
00:34:24,820 --> 00:34:25,300
Fine, fine.

733
00:34:25,740 --> 00:34:27,099
I keep losing to you now, happy?

734
00:34:28,420 --> 00:34:30,099
Go home to your daughter.
I'll drive you.

735
00:34:31,499 --> 00:34:33,460
Don't you have anything else going on?

736
00:34:34,059 --> 00:34:34,940
No need

737
00:34:34,940 --> 00:34:36,740
to take female clients out for dinner?

738
00:34:37,059 --> 00:34:37,619
Ms. Bai,

739
00:34:38,260 --> 00:34:39,780
middle-aged greasiness is not good.

740
00:34:40,179 --> 00:34:42,059
I'm still the heartthrob of our firm.

741
00:34:42,380 --> 00:34:44,099
Decent and principled.

742
00:34:44,380 --> 00:34:45,659
You got time to mock me,

743
00:34:45,900 --> 00:34:47,699
but no time to go home to your kid?

744
00:34:48,780 --> 00:34:50,699
Aren't you traveling for work tomorrow?

745
00:34:53,139 --> 00:34:53,499
Alright.

746
00:34:54,460 --> 00:34:54,980
Let's go.

747
00:34:55,260 --> 00:34:55,619
Go.

748
00:35:12,499 --> 00:35:12,940
Mr. Zhou.

749
00:35:13,659 --> 00:35:15,019
I sent Ms. Bai the updated file

750
00:35:15,019 --> 00:35:15,780
this morning.

751
00:35:15,780 --> 00:35:16,860
She hasn't responded.

752
00:35:16,940 --> 00:35:18,019
Do you know the situation?

753
00:35:18,499 --> 00:35:19,340
She's away for work.

754
00:35:19,619 --> 00:35:20,780
Probably on a flight now.

755
00:35:22,980 --> 00:35:23,420
Mr. Zhou,

756
00:35:23,619 --> 00:35:24,579
do you have any tasks

757
00:35:24,579 --> 00:35:25,460
I could assist with?

758
00:35:26,019 --> 00:35:27,019
On my end...

759
00:35:27,860 --> 00:35:28,260
The firm

760
00:35:29,059 --> 00:35:31,420
is offering community legal guidance
this Saturday.

761
00:35:31,900 --> 00:35:33,219
I signed up last night.

762
00:35:34,940 --> 00:35:36,380
How much work have you taken on?

763
00:35:36,659 --> 00:35:37,340
Three months.

764
00:35:37,340 --> 00:35:38,499
Can your health handle this?

765
00:35:39,099 --> 00:35:40,179
Ms. Bai's work is hard.

766
00:35:40,260 --> 00:35:41,340
You can ask for help.

767
00:35:41,980 --> 00:35:43,300
No need. I can manage.

768
00:35:44,499 --> 00:35:45,900
Independent completion is ideal,

769
00:35:47,420 --> 00:35:48,980
but cooperation matters as well.

770
00:35:49,380 --> 00:35:50,900
Jun An always emphasizes teamwork.

771
00:35:51,619 --> 00:35:52,980
I worked hard to get

772
00:35:52,980 --> 00:35:54,539
this opportunity to work with Ms. Bai.

773
00:35:54,940 --> 00:35:55,900
I want to prove myself

774
00:35:56,099 --> 00:35:56,780
and do it alone.

775
00:35:59,179 --> 00:35:59,579
Okay.

776
00:35:59,940 --> 00:36:00,699
It's your call.

777
00:36:04,619 --> 00:36:06,300
Quitting time in about 10 minutes.

778
00:36:07,179 --> 00:36:08,420
Friday nights

779
00:36:08,499 --> 00:36:11,539
are corporate drones' happiest hours.

780
00:36:11,980 --> 00:36:12,740
Seriously,

781
00:36:12,980 --> 00:36:14,179
this single week

782
00:36:14,219 --> 00:36:15,900
felt like an entire lifetime.

783
00:36:16,300 --> 00:36:17,940
I've sprouted new wrinkles.

784
00:36:19,380 --> 00:36:20,420
My friends

785
00:36:20,420 --> 00:36:21,659
invited me out this weekend.

786
00:36:21,900 --> 00:36:24,139
Now I decide I won't leave my bed

787
00:36:24,139 --> 00:36:25,579
even if they kill me.

788
00:36:25,860 --> 00:36:26,539
Same here.

789
00:36:28,380 --> 00:36:29,340
Quality sleep is great.

790
00:36:29,780 --> 00:36:30,860
Rest up to recharge

791
00:36:30,860 --> 00:36:31,820
for upcoming tasks.

792
00:36:32,179 --> 00:36:33,420
Mr. Zhou, another assessment?

793
00:36:34,380 --> 00:36:36,219
Next week is the third task

794
00:36:36,219 --> 00:36:36,980
of the first round.

795
00:36:37,420 --> 00:36:38,260
Once results are out,

796
00:36:38,260 --> 00:36:39,300
you'll get ranked

797
00:36:39,460 --> 00:36:40,740
based on accumulated points.

798
00:36:41,219 --> 00:36:42,460
So the lowest scorer this time

799
00:36:42,460 --> 00:36:43,499
gets eliminated?

800
00:36:46,699 --> 00:36:47,019
Right.

801
00:36:47,179 --> 00:36:48,179
Jiang Chen, Ren Jiatong,

802
00:36:48,179 --> 00:36:49,659
I'll add you to the group chat

803
00:36:49,659 --> 00:36:50,699
for the legal aid event.

804
00:36:50,940 --> 00:36:51,980
Tomorrow at 8 AM,

805
00:36:52,179 --> 00:36:53,260
the bus leaves from Jun An.

806
00:36:59,099 --> 00:37:00,539
Are you two human-shaped AI?

807
00:37:00,900 --> 00:37:02,059
Don't you need rest?

808
00:37:02,659 --> 00:37:04,659
Finally a weekend,
and you signed up for it?

809
00:37:11,464 --> 00:37:12,456
(Pro Bono Legal Aid)

810
00:37:12,456 --> 00:37:15,546
(Explanation: Legal professionals)

811
00:37:15,546 --> 00:37:19,016
(provide free legal guidance
to the public.)

812
00:37:22,619 --> 00:37:23,619
(Jun An Law Firm's Public Service Team)
Put the things

813
00:37:23,619 --> 00:37:25,139
at designated spots.

814
00:37:25,619 --> 00:37:27,420
Conduct legal education sessions
at stations

815
00:37:27,460 --> 00:37:28,780
or walk through neighborhoods.

816
00:37:29,260 --> 00:37:30,659
Coordinate with community staff,

817
00:37:30,900 --> 00:37:32,300
identify potential clients,

818
00:37:32,300 --> 00:37:32,980
and register them

819
00:37:33,059 --> 00:37:34,019
for future follow-up.

820
00:37:40,820 --> 00:37:41,420
Is it heavy?

821
00:37:41,420 --> 00:37:42,300
You should've told me.

822
00:37:42,980 --> 00:37:44,099
I've trained for this.

823
00:37:44,340 --> 00:37:45,820
I could carry the water and you.

824
00:37:46,460 --> 00:37:46,820
Okay.

825
00:37:46,860 --> 00:37:47,900
You should play the lead

826
00:37:47,900 --> 00:37:48,780
in Wonder Woman.

827
00:37:49,059 --> 00:37:49,659
Let me hurry up

828
00:37:49,659 --> 00:37:50,980
and email that screenwriter.

829
00:37:51,380 --> 00:37:54,059
Suggest using your story as inspiration.

830
00:37:54,219 --> 00:37:56,139
Make it about a lawyer by day

831
00:37:56,139 --> 00:37:57,539
and superheroine by night.

832
00:37:57,860 --> 00:37:59,499
From Fengtai, Haidian,

833
00:37:59,499 --> 00:38:01,139
to Dongba, Changying,
all your territory.

834
00:38:01,499 --> 00:38:03,380
Punch every villain
into the stratosphere.

835
00:38:04,300 --> 00:38:06,139
This script would definitely flop.

836
00:38:06,539 --> 00:38:08,139
I'd watch it in a heartbeat.

837
00:38:09,059 --> 00:38:09,619
Young man.

838
00:38:09,780 --> 00:38:10,179
Sir.

839
00:38:10,900 --> 00:38:12,059
Are you screenwriters?

840
00:38:12,460 --> 00:38:13,820
Sir, we're not screenwriters.

841
00:38:14,099 --> 00:38:14,619
We're law...

842
00:38:16,900 --> 00:38:18,780
We're interns at Jun An Law Firm.

843
00:38:19,499 --> 00:38:20,380
This event.

844
00:38:20,780 --> 00:38:22,539
Do you need legal consultation?

845
00:38:23,460 --> 00:38:24,539
I'm retired.

846
00:38:25,059 --> 00:38:26,059
I wrote a novel

847
00:38:26,539 --> 00:38:28,260
and then adapted it into a screenplay.

848
00:38:28,900 --> 00:38:30,340
If you were screenwriters,

849
00:38:30,539 --> 00:38:32,380
I'd ask for some advice.

850
00:38:32,820 --> 00:38:34,579
But lawyers? No need.

851
00:38:35,099 --> 00:38:36,019
Not that serious.

852
00:38:36,900 --> 00:38:37,820
Not that level yet.

853
00:38:37,820 --> 00:38:39,099
But you may need it.

854
00:38:39,300 --> 00:38:39,619
Well.

855
00:38:40,460 --> 00:38:41,860
Take down my number,

856
00:38:42,300 --> 00:38:44,179
and call me anytime

857
00:38:44,300 --> 00:38:45,300
if you need advice.

858
00:38:45,380 --> 00:38:45,699
Okay.

859
00:38:45,780 --> 00:38:47,179
I know little about screenwriting,

860
00:38:47,179 --> 00:38:48,179
but I love movies.

861
00:38:48,380 --> 00:38:49,740
My classmate works in Hollywood.

862
00:38:50,179 --> 00:38:50,659
No trouble.

863
00:38:50,980 --> 00:38:51,260
Okay.

864
00:38:52,460 --> 00:38:53,499
Excuse me for a moment.

865
00:38:57,780 --> 00:38:59,260
I need to ask you something.

866
00:39:11,179 --> 00:39:11,619
You came.

867
00:39:12,539 --> 00:39:12,900
Sit.

868
00:39:16,099 --> 00:39:16,860
Let me tell you.

869
00:39:17,460 --> 00:39:18,460
Yan Fei, my sister.

870
00:39:19,139 --> 00:39:19,499
Fei,

871
00:39:19,860 --> 00:39:20,499
this is Eddie.

872
00:39:21,059 --> 00:39:22,219
The second son of Mr. Jiang.

873
00:39:22,820 --> 00:39:24,579
Mr. Jiang said you two attended

874
00:39:24,860 --> 00:39:26,300
a summer camp in America together.

875
00:39:26,980 --> 00:39:27,900
Childhood friends.

876
00:39:29,699 --> 00:39:30,219
Sophia.

877
00:39:30,820 --> 00:39:31,539
You didn't change.

878
00:39:31,940 --> 00:39:32,699
Still as beautiful.

879
00:39:33,380 --> 00:39:35,659
Honestly, you've changed quite a bit.

880
00:39:36,179 --> 00:39:37,460
You looked good as a kid.

881
00:39:38,699 --> 00:39:39,139
Fei,

882
00:39:40,059 --> 00:39:42,059
Eddie manages the global division

883
00:39:42,139 --> 00:39:43,219
for Mr. Jiang's company.

884
00:39:43,780 --> 00:39:44,659
They need lawyers.

885
00:39:45,380 --> 00:39:46,260
You two should talk.

886
00:39:46,699 --> 00:39:48,219
You might collaborate in the future.

887
00:39:49,740 --> 00:39:50,539
You need a lawyer?

888
00:39:51,219 --> 00:39:51,820
Why?

889
00:39:52,659 --> 00:39:54,260
Legal troubles lately?

890
00:39:54,340 --> 00:39:55,420
A debtor won't pay?

891
00:39:57,300 --> 00:39:59,260
Divorce? Planning to divorce?

892
00:40:00,099 --> 00:40:01,619
I can't represent you in this,

893
00:40:01,619 --> 00:40:03,340
but I know good lawyers.

894
00:40:03,699 --> 00:40:04,139
Listen.

895
00:40:04,139 --> 00:40:06,539
Divorce is tricky.
Not major but complicated.

896
00:40:06,900 --> 00:40:08,219
With kids involved,

897
00:40:08,219 --> 00:40:09,699
you'll lose some assets.

898
00:40:10,019 --> 00:40:12,579
Successful guys like you

899
00:40:12,780 --> 00:40:14,380
are usually at fault.

900
00:40:14,539 --> 00:40:16,099
So maybe...

901
00:40:16,099 --> 00:40:16,659
Yan Fei.

902
00:40:20,260 --> 00:40:21,340
Are you out of your mind?

903
00:40:22,380 --> 00:40:23,420
Dad told me

904
00:40:23,539 --> 00:40:25,260
to introduce you to decent men.

905
00:40:25,499 --> 00:40:26,860
That's why I brought Eddie.

906
00:40:27,460 --> 00:40:28,659
Why take it out on me?

907
00:40:29,340 --> 00:40:31,340
I've told you a thousand times.

908
00:40:31,340 --> 00:40:34,260
I'll date when I want to.

909
00:40:34,420 --> 00:40:36,659
Stop introducing your partners' sons

910
00:40:36,659 --> 00:40:37,940
or grandsons to me.

911
00:40:38,139 --> 00:40:39,420
We've only been rich recently

912
00:40:39,659 --> 00:40:41,460
and are already pushing
arranged marriages?

913
00:40:41,460 --> 00:40:42,380
Or inheritance schemes?

914
00:40:42,820 --> 00:40:44,059
Say that to Mom and Dad.

915
00:40:44,820 --> 00:40:45,860
I'm just the messenger.

916
00:40:46,380 --> 00:40:47,740
I even paid for lunch.

917
00:40:48,059 --> 00:40:48,980
What did I do wrong?

918
00:40:50,099 --> 00:40:51,900
You broke up
with the British guy years ago.

919
00:40:51,900 --> 00:40:52,619
Why still single?

920
00:40:53,659 --> 00:40:54,900
But I'm still young.

921
00:40:54,900 --> 00:40:56,300
Why are you all in such a hurry?

922
00:40:56,980 --> 00:40:57,820
And let me tell you.

923
00:40:58,059 --> 00:41:00,499
This internship is getting
more interesting by the day.

924
00:41:00,499 --> 00:41:01,900
Competition is so exciting.

925
00:41:02,059 --> 00:41:02,740
Think it's fun?

926
00:41:04,699 --> 00:41:06,340
Keep doing this internship longer.

927
00:41:07,420 --> 00:41:08,300
If you're tired of it,

928
00:41:08,820 --> 00:41:09,820
focus on looking good,

929
00:41:09,980 --> 00:41:10,579
dating,

930
00:41:10,820 --> 00:41:11,499
and social media.

931
00:41:11,860 --> 00:41:12,499
So good.

932
00:41:12,940 --> 00:41:13,619
Could you...?

933
00:41:15,579 --> 00:41:16,340
Wasting my breath.

934
00:41:16,699 --> 00:41:17,740
I've got things to do.

935
00:41:29,659 --> 00:41:30,499
Listen, Zhou Nian.

936
00:41:30,860 --> 00:41:32,019
You need to set a deadline.

937
00:41:32,260 --> 00:41:34,499
Can you get the wedding apartment
ready by year-end?

938
00:41:34,900 --> 00:41:36,340
It's been so long.

939
00:41:37,579 --> 00:41:38,420
Our daughter

940
00:41:38,579 --> 00:41:39,740
was a fresh blossom,

941
00:41:40,019 --> 00:41:42,300
but now, she's wilting with you.

942
00:41:42,900 --> 00:41:43,780
Exactly.

943
00:41:44,740 --> 00:41:46,340
When will you arrange a job for me?

944
00:41:47,219 --> 00:41:48,300
I remember.

945
00:41:48,900 --> 00:41:50,099
You better remember.

946
00:41:57,940 --> 00:41:58,340
Hello.

947
00:41:58,900 --> 00:41:59,380
Chenchen,

948
00:42:00,099 --> 00:42:01,260
you don't have to see me,

949
00:42:01,420 --> 00:42:02,900
but you must return to Chongqing.

950
00:42:03,380 --> 00:42:04,340
Your father's law firm

951
00:42:04,340 --> 00:42:05,619
started during our marriage.

952
00:42:05,619 --> 00:42:06,579
I own a share of it.

953
00:42:06,820 --> 00:42:07,940
You promised to help me

954
00:42:07,940 --> 00:42:09,260
get it back.

955
00:42:09,980 --> 00:42:11,300
Mom, I want to see you,

956
00:42:11,579 --> 00:42:12,539
but I don't understand.

957
00:42:12,539 --> 00:42:14,260
You never asked for any money before.

958
00:42:14,260 --> 00:42:15,059
Why are you suddenly

959
00:42:15,499 --> 00:42:16,619
demanding money now?

960
00:42:17,860 --> 00:42:19,139
Don't pressure me, okay?

961
00:42:19,499 --> 00:42:20,780
I don't want to ask for money.

962
00:42:20,980 --> 00:42:21,900
Me? Pressure you?

963
00:42:22,300 --> 00:42:23,980
I'm doing this for your own good.

964
00:42:24,099 --> 00:42:25,179
Your "self-reliance" story.

965
00:42:25,179 --> 00:42:25,940
Is that true?

966
00:42:26,380 --> 00:42:27,619
Your college fees abroad...

967
00:42:27,780 --> 00:42:28,059
You...

968
00:42:28,780 --> 00:42:30,219
I sold our house to fund you.

969
00:42:30,980 --> 00:42:32,059
The money

970
00:42:32,059 --> 00:42:33,579
is being gradually repaid, isn't it?

971
00:42:33,860 --> 00:42:35,179
We already agreed before

972
00:42:35,179 --> 00:42:36,420
if I stayed

973
00:42:36,420 --> 00:42:37,980
at the American law firm for two years,

974
00:42:37,980 --> 00:42:38,980
I'd earn back the money.

975
00:42:39,219 --> 00:42:40,820
But you insisted I return, didn't you?

976
00:42:41,260 --> 00:42:42,740
Why can't you trust me?

977
00:42:43,499 --> 00:42:44,499
I asked you to return

978
00:42:44,499 --> 00:42:46,619
because you're entitled
to your father's firm.

979
00:42:47,099 --> 00:42:48,579
How can you be so naive?

980
00:42:49,219 --> 00:42:50,300
You say I don't trust you?

981
00:42:50,619 --> 00:42:51,380
If I didn't,

982
00:42:51,380 --> 00:42:53,179
I'd sell our house
for your Haryald education?

983
00:42:53,860 --> 00:42:55,099
You're my only son.

984
00:42:55,340 --> 00:42:57,019
How can you say such things to me?

985
00:42:58,139 --> 00:42:59,579
Mom, give me three more months

986
00:43:00,780 --> 00:43:02,619
to win first place
in the Talent Hunt Program.

987
00:43:03,300 --> 00:43:04,940
I don't need to inherit anything.

988
00:43:05,260 --> 00:43:06,179
Have you considered it?

989
00:43:06,460 --> 00:43:08,059
What if you don't make it to the end?

990
00:43:15,312 --> 00:43:16,136
(Why are the candidates in the program
just interns, not trainee lawyers?)

991
00:43:16,166 --> 00:43:16,726
(A trainee lawyer is a formal employee
with a signed contract at a law firm.)

992
00:43:16,726 --> 00:43:17,320
(They have passed the National Unified
Legal Profession Qualification Examination.)

993
00:43:17,320 --> 00:43:17,846
(They undergo internships
to become a qualified lawyer.)

994
00:43:17,846 --> 00:43:18,536
(The "internship" for trainee lawyers
is a legally required entry procedure.)

995
00:43:18,536 --> 00:43:21,000
(The program candidates are students.)

996
00:43:23,048 --> 00:43:26,376
(They're doing a regular internship.)
