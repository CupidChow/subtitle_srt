28
00:01:54,430 --> 00:01:56,070
I once faced countless competitors.

29
00:01:56,469 --> 00:01:58,070
I fought my way through competitions.

30
00:01:58,070 --> 00:01:58,989
That's how I came here.

31
00:01:59,189 --> 00:02:00,790
If I hadn't gotten
into a top university,

32
00:02:00,790 --> 00:02:02,389
I wouldn't have any chance
to stand here.

33
00:02:02,590 --> 00:02:03,549
I can't make mistakes.

34
00:02:04,710 --> 00:02:05,510
You're different.

35
00:02:05,510 --> 00:02:06,310
You're privileged.

36
00:02:06,909 --> 00:02:07,870
No law firms

37
00:02:07,870 --> 00:02:08,830
wouldn't want

38
00:02:08,949 --> 00:02:10,990
a person like you who brings clients.

39
00:02:11,550 --> 00:02:12,680
You don't need to work hard,

40
00:02:13,469 --> 00:02:14,550
flatter superiors,

41
00:02:15,189 --> 00:02:16,349
or compete for recognition.

42
00:02:16,349 --> 00:02:18,270
Yet you easily joined Mr. Zhuang's team.

43
00:02:18,669 --> 00:02:19,304
That's you.

44
00:02:19,949 --> 00:02:20,840
What are you implying?

45
00:02:24,189 --> 00:02:26,469
Li Ke, enough.

46
00:02:26,830 --> 00:02:28,390
I'm not implying anything. I just mean,

47
00:02:28,949 --> 00:02:31,310
Huang Yue once said
she envied Ren Jiatong,

48
00:02:31,749 --> 00:02:32,789
but I don't envy anyone

49
00:02:32,789 --> 00:02:33,469
but you.

50
00:02:35,030 --> 00:02:36,710
You probably can't understand

51
00:02:36,710 --> 00:02:37,909
how much people like us

52
00:02:37,909 --> 00:02:39,590
cherish this offer.

53
00:02:39,624 --> 00:02:40,390
But you know what?

54
00:02:40,390 --> 00:02:42,629
Your constant act of pretending

55
00:02:42,749 --> 00:02:44,349
not to care about anything

56
00:02:46,030 --> 00:02:47,629
is really grating.

57
00:02:51,870 --> 00:02:52,488

58
00:02:53,949 --> 00:02:54,469

00:03:00,710 --> 00:03:01,320
What happened?

60
00:03:04,189 --> 00:03:04,744
Mr. Zhou.

61
00:03:05,870 --> 00:03:07,870
What did Mr. Zhuang say?
Will we be punished?

62
00:03:08,550 --> 00:03:10,909
Mr. Zhou, I decided
on the research approach.

63
00:03:10,990 --> 00:03:13,590
As team leader, I take the blame.
Don't blame Li Ke and Yan Fei.

64
00:03:15,069 --> 00:03:17,030
Mr. Zhuang didn't comment. Leave early.

65
00:03:17,310 --> 00:03:19,629
Enjoy the Mid-Autumn Festival.
We'll handle it later.

00:03:30,830 --> 00:03:31,590
Dad. Mom.

67
00:03:32,270 --> 00:03:33,030
Go get your sister.

68
00:03:34,789 --> 00:03:35,949
The crabs are ready.

69
00:03:36,189 --> 00:03:38,110
She won't listen to me.

70
00:03:38,669 --> 00:03:40,710
She went straight to her room.

71
00:03:41,430 --> 00:03:42,229
Her face

72
00:03:43,390 --> 00:03:44,509
is as long as this fish.

73
00:03:46,030 --> 00:03:48,430
Aren't you two too old for this?

74
00:03:49,030 --> 00:03:51,830
Constantly bickering like children?

75
00:03:52,390 --> 00:03:53,030
Go get Fei down.

76
00:03:53,430 --> 00:03:54,310
I'm not her keeper.

77
00:03:55,590 --> 00:03:56,550
Come on.

78
00:03:57,110 --> 00:03:58,710
Ma already told me.

79
00:03:59,669 --> 00:04:00,310
He said

80
00:04:00,629 --> 00:04:03,390
Yan Da canceled his date

81
00:04:03,390 --> 00:04:05,469
with his influencer girlfriend tonight

82
00:04:05,909 --> 00:04:07,870
just to have dinner with Fei.

83
00:04:10,430 --> 00:04:11,390
I came back today

84
00:04:11,710 --> 00:04:13,830
to spend Mid-Autumn Festival with you.

85
00:04:15,150 --> 00:04:15,710
Thanks.

86
00:04:16,390 --> 00:04:17,669
Stop the act.

87
00:04:19,669 --> 00:04:21,669
Look at these dishes.

88
00:04:21,950 --> 00:04:23,469
You told the cook to make these.

89
00:04:25,109 --> 00:04:27,710
These are Fei's favorite dishes.

90
00:04:29,630 --> 00:04:30,669
Fine.

91
00:04:32,270 --> 00:04:33,309
I'll get her down

92
00:04:33,750 --> 00:04:34,510
and eat.

93
00:04:35,349 --> 00:04:35,944
Go on.

94
00:04:38,549 --> 00:04:40,309
Wait. What influencer girlfriend?

95
00:04:41,429 --> 00:04:42,229
I didn't know.

96
00:05:04,270 --> 00:05:04,789
What?

97
00:05:05,469 --> 00:05:06,669
I was changing clothes.

98
00:05:22,950 --> 00:05:24,669
Relax. Don't be so jumpy.

99
00:05:24,669 --> 00:05:26,909
Okay? Mom and Dad don't know
about my suicide attempt.

100
00:05:28,109 --> 00:05:28,712
Yan Fei.

101
00:05:29,109 --> 00:05:29,830
I don't care

102
00:05:29,830 --> 00:05:31,150
what lifestyle you'll choose.

103
00:05:32,390 --> 00:05:33,669
But never mention that again.

104
00:05:34,349 --> 00:05:36,469
What's wrong? Why so intense?

105
00:05:48,950 --> 00:05:49,510
You know what?

106
00:05:51,469 --> 00:05:53,349
I was the first person
besides our parents

107
00:05:55,270 --> 00:05:56,590
to hold you after you were born.

108
00:05:58,309 --> 00:06:00,070
I watched you grow

109
00:06:01,510 --> 00:06:02,869
from a tiny baby into a big girl.

110
00:06:06,190 --> 00:06:07,349
You're my sister.

111
00:06:09,909 --> 00:06:11,789
No one in this world can

112
00:06:13,349 --> 00:06:13,909
bully you

113
00:06:15,309 --> 00:06:15,869
or hurt you,

114
00:06:18,510 --> 00:06:19,270
including yourself.

115
00:06:25,030 --> 00:06:25,704
I know.

116
00:06:26,789 --> 00:06:29,469
No one bullies me except you.

117
00:06:31,950 --> 00:06:32,616
Where you going?

118
00:06:33,469 --> 00:06:35,150
I left something at the firm.
I'll get it.

119
00:06:35,950 --> 00:06:36,950
Again?

120
00:06:37,309 --> 00:06:38,909
It's fine. Don't worry.

Zhubao.

123
00:06:47,349 --> 00:06:48,789
I'm not doing anything this holiday.

124
00:06:48,789 --> 00:06:49,830
I'll spend time with you.

125
00:06:51,309 --> 00:06:51,880
Okay.

126
00:06:54,349 --> 00:06:56,150
I want this. Strawberry pudding.

127
00:06:57,150 --> 00:06:58,590
Sure, I'll order two for you.

128
00:06:59,070 --> 00:07:01,190
And a mango pudding too.

129
00:07:01,190 --> 00:07:01,750
Okay?

130
00:07:01,750 --> 00:07:02,472
Okay.

131
00:07:10,469 --> 00:07:11,349
How did you connect

132
00:07:11,349 --> 00:07:12,229
to the hotel Wi-Fi?

133
00:07:12,789 --> 00:07:13,750
I tried earlier,

134
00:07:13,750 --> 00:07:15,070
but it required a password.

135
00:07:17,950 --> 00:07:19,070
I...

136
00:07:20,390 --> 00:07:22,950
I did it in the restroom.

137
00:07:26,309 --> 00:07:27,590
The password's in the restroom?

138
00:07:29,190 --> 00:07:29,768
Right.

139
00:07:31,590 --> 00:07:33,150
Mr. Song's calling. I need to take it.

140
00:07:36,789 --> 00:07:37,669
Hello, Mr. Song?

141
00:07:41,510 --> 00:07:42,030
Okay.

142
00:07:42,030 --> 00:07:42,909
I'll do it right away.

143
00:07:44,070 --> 00:07:44,909
I'll call back later.

144
00:07:52,950 --> 00:07:53,549
Holy moly!

145
00:07:56,109 --> 00:07:56,744
Guo Xiaoyu.

146
00:07:57,549 --> 00:07:59,390
Can you eat first before working?

147
00:08:00,469 --> 00:08:01,630
Mr. Song needs it urgently.

148
00:08:02,789 --> 00:08:03,909
Are you eating or not?

149
00:08:04,429 --> 00:08:05,549
You go ahead.

150
00:08:05,669 --> 00:08:06,710
I'll finish it quickly.

151
00:08:39,470 --> 00:08:40,350
Zhubao, I'm done.

152
00:08:52,549 --> 00:08:53,549
Zhubao, what's wrong?

153
00:08:54,870 --> 00:08:55,589
I'm going back.

154
00:08:58,829 --> 00:09:00,789
I've submitted my work.

155
00:09:00,789 --> 00:09:01,589
I'm starving now.

156
00:09:01,589 --> 00:09:02,789
Let's grab something.

157
00:09:03,150 --> 00:09:03,829
Work emergency.

158
00:09:03,829 --> 00:09:04,470
I have to leave.

159
00:09:06,150 --> 00:09:07,429
Working during the holiday?

160
00:09:07,429 --> 00:09:08,669
What emergency?

161
00:09:13,069 --> 00:09:14,829
Just say you're mad at me!

162
00:09:14,829 --> 00:09:17,110
Stop using work as an excuse!

163
00:09:17,789 --> 00:09:18,350
Aren't you?

164
00:09:19,230 --> 00:09:22,069
Your boss knows you're on holiday.
One call from him,

165
00:09:22,909 --> 00:09:24,150
and you ditch me like a fool.

166
00:09:24,230 --> 00:09:25,270
You're complaining again.

167
00:09:25,270 --> 00:09:27,110
Can't you respect my job?

168
00:09:27,669 --> 00:09:29,309
Some clients are foreigners.

169
00:09:29,429 --> 00:09:30,789
They don't celebrate the festival.

170
00:09:32,150 --> 00:09:33,350
Then tell your boss

171
00:09:33,549 --> 00:09:34,589
your boyfriend is Chinese.

172
00:09:34,709 --> 00:09:35,990
We celebrate the festival.

173
00:09:36,510 --> 00:09:38,350
Stop being unreasonable!

174
00:09:39,470 --> 00:09:41,069
Do I even matter to you?

175
00:09:41,789 --> 00:09:42,344
And you?

176
00:09:43,510 --> 00:09:44,104
Guo Xiaoyu.

177
00:09:45,750 --> 00:09:46,470
Is your heart

178
00:09:47,350 --> 00:09:47,990
full of work

179
00:09:48,270 --> 00:09:48,870
without me?

180
00:09:59,230 --> 00:10:01,709
I booked the room
for three days. Already paid.

181
00:10:02,709 --> 00:10:03,309
You stay here

182
00:10:03,949 --> 00:10:04,510
and have fun.

183
00:10:18,652 --> 00:10:21,000
(Qing City)

184
00:10:53,390 --> 00:10:54,150
Coming!

185
00:10:56,350 --> 00:10:56,968
Mom.

186
00:10:57,510 --> 00:10:58,230
Jiatong.

187
00:10:58,789 --> 00:10:59,750
Why are you back?

188
00:11:00,470 --> 00:11:01,429
I'm on holiday.

189
00:11:01,429 --> 00:11:02,030
So I came back.

190
00:11:05,630 --> 00:11:06,549
Hey.

191
00:11:06,709 --> 00:11:07,870
Just three days off,

192
00:11:07,870 --> 00:11:09,390
yet you traveled here.

193
00:11:09,390 --> 00:11:10,270
It's exhausting.

194
00:11:10,750 --> 00:11:11,829
High-speed rail is fast.

195
00:11:12,390 --> 00:11:14,110
I brought a cake for you.

196
00:11:14,110 --> 00:11:16,189
This brand's trendy now.
People queue for it.

197
00:11:17,870 --> 00:11:18,510
Don't open it.

198
00:11:19,309 --> 00:11:20,589
I'm off desserts now.

199
00:11:21,110 --> 00:11:21,829
I'm on a diet.

200
00:11:22,470 --> 00:11:24,429
Lin says I'm fat.

201
00:11:27,630 --> 00:11:28,549
He said so?

202
00:11:30,949 --> 00:11:33,350
Do you think I'm fat?

203
00:11:34,669 --> 00:11:35,709
Or just old?

204
00:11:37,270 --> 00:11:37,864
Wait.

205
00:11:43,309 --> 00:11:43,909
Lin.

206
00:11:44,110 --> 00:11:45,390
When are you coming back?

207
00:11:45,829 --> 00:11:46,870
Jiatong is back.

208
00:11:47,829 --> 00:11:48,488
Mom.

209
00:11:50,309 --> 00:11:51,990
I saw Mr. Lin downstairs.

210
00:11:56,350 --> 00:11:57,230
You saw him?

211
00:11:58,589 --> 00:11:59,630
He's very busy these days.

212
00:11:59,909 --> 00:12:00,829
He will be back soon.

213
00:12:01,069 --> 00:12:03,030
I just texted him.

214
00:12:03,309 --> 00:12:03,870
But I saw him

215
00:12:03,870 --> 00:12:05,630
in a car with another woman.

216
00:12:07,150 --> 00:12:07,829
Well...

217
00:12:09,069 --> 00:12:09,704
Well...

218
00:12:12,230 --> 00:12:12,789
Well,

219
00:12:13,549 --> 00:12:15,230
that's his sister.

220
00:12:16,230 --> 00:12:18,350
They've been good to each other.

221
00:12:18,630 --> 00:12:19,789
Wake up, Mom.

222
00:12:21,230 --> 00:12:22,630
Mr. Lin has been cheating on you.

223
00:12:25,390 --> 00:12:26,789
He has been trying to avoid you.

224
00:12:27,189 --> 00:12:28,429
He is with another woman.

225
00:12:30,069 --> 00:12:30,949
After my dad died,

226
00:12:30,949 --> 00:12:32,270
you immediately married him.

227
00:12:33,110 --> 00:12:33,829
What now?

228
00:12:33,829 --> 00:12:34,750
Will you pretend

229
00:12:35,150 --> 00:12:36,549
that everything's fine?

230
00:12:40,510 --> 00:12:41,549
You've gone too far.

231
00:12:46,789 --> 00:12:47,669
Divorce him.

232
00:12:49,669 --> 00:12:50,309
Don't worry.

233
00:12:51,470 --> 00:12:52,230
I'll support you.

234
00:13:11,589 --> 00:13:12,150
Jiatong.

235
00:13:13,309 --> 00:13:13,864
Jiatong.

236
00:13:16,270 --> 00:13:17,069
Xiaoyu.

237
00:13:18,069 --> 00:13:19,390
Didn't you go back to Hangzhou?

238
00:13:21,470 --> 00:13:22,909
I came back early.

239
00:13:24,589 --> 00:13:25,750
Are you drinking now?

240
00:13:29,150 --> 00:13:30,390
Let's spend the festival.

241
00:13:33,510 --> 00:13:35,270
Bad relationship.

242
00:13:36,030 --> 00:13:37,949
Bad man.

243
00:13:39,510 --> 00:13:40,630
I don't want any of it!

244
00:13:42,150 --> 00:13:43,309
Jiatong, listen to me.

245
00:13:43,829 --> 00:13:45,630
Men can't be relied on.

246
00:13:47,309 --> 00:13:49,189
He actually left me alone

247
00:13:49,189 --> 00:13:51,350
at the hotel and left.

248
00:13:52,949 --> 00:13:54,390
What a scumbag!

249
00:14:01,150 --> 00:14:02,589
Not just men,

250
00:14:04,230 --> 00:14:05,110
but women too.

251
00:14:07,030 --> 00:14:08,309
You can only depend on yourself.

252
00:14:08,589 --> 00:14:09,256
Right.

253
00:14:10,030 --> 00:14:11,390
Jiatong, you're absolutely right.

254
00:14:12,589 --> 00:14:14,470
I have to rely on nobody

255
00:14:17,470 --> 00:14:18,270
but myself.

256
00:14:19,144 --> 00:14:19,709
Seriously.

257
00:14:27,909 --> 00:14:28,549
Guo Xiaoyu.

258
00:14:31,949 --> 00:14:32,549
Are you asleep?

259
00:14:33,189 --> 00:14:33,896
Yeah.

260
00:14:36,309 --> 00:14:38,309
I must depend on myself.

261
00:14:38,789 --> 00:14:39,630
Be quiet!

262
00:14:39,630 --> 00:14:40,589
What's wrong with you?

263
00:14:40,589 --> 00:14:42,189
I can only rely on myself.

264
00:14:42,709 --> 00:14:44,510
Enough. The police will
come for you soon.

265
00:14:47,150 --> 00:14:47,909
Police?

266
00:14:48,990 --> 00:14:50,549
Are the police here?

267
00:14:52,350 --> 00:14:55,549
Jiatong, I need to tell the police.

268
00:14:57,750 --> 00:15:00,069
I want to sue Zhu Zhisheng.

269
00:15:02,270 --> 00:15:03,750
He is a bad man.

270
00:15:04,390 --> 00:15:05,789
He hurts me.

271
00:15:07,829 --> 00:15:10,470
Fine. I'll be your lawyer.

272
00:15:11,270 --> 00:15:13,390
I'll make sure he gets punished.

273
00:15:14,150 --> 00:15:15,069
Punish him.

274
00:15:15,230 --> 00:15:15,750
Punish him.

275
00:15:16,150 --> 00:15:17,110
Go to bed now.

276
00:15:18,030 --> 00:15:19,350
I remember.

277
00:15:20,390 --> 00:15:21,789
I remember what you said.

278
00:15:22,589 --> 00:15:23,144
Jiatong.

279
00:15:24,990 --> 00:15:26,709
Will you really make him get punished?

280
00:15:27,069 --> 00:15:27,630
Will you?

281
00:15:43,870 --> 00:15:44,470
Where are you?

282
00:15:44,630 --> 00:15:45,549
I'm at the law firm.

283
00:15:46,150 --> 00:15:47,669
Having dinner with colleagues tonight.

284
00:15:47,909 --> 00:15:48,510
Don't worry.

285
00:15:49,230 --> 00:15:49,896
Come home early.

286
00:16:12,155 --> 00:16:21,069
(Guo Xiaoyu)

287
00:16:21,069 --> 00:16:23,669
The subscriber you dialed
is unavailable.

288
00:16:23,949 --> 00:16:25,230
Please try again later.

289
00:16:30,870 --> 00:16:31,400
Jiang Chen.

290
00:16:37,030 --> 00:16:37,589
Had dinner?

291
00:16:46,829 --> 00:16:49,150
Actually, I wanted
to join Mr. Song's team the most.

292
00:16:51,030 --> 00:16:53,189
Do you know why
I ended up in Mr. Zhuang's team?

293
00:16:56,630 --> 00:16:58,429
Because I'm my parents' daughter,

294
00:16:58,709 --> 00:16:59,789
my brother's sister.

295
00:16:59,949 --> 00:17:02,709
I'm a spoiled rich girl.

296
00:17:06,270 --> 00:17:08,069
What I like doesn't matter.

297
00:17:08,710 --> 00:17:09,950
No matter who I choose,

298
00:17:09,950 --> 00:17:12,149
I'll still end up in Mr. Zhuang's team.

299
00:17:13,030 --> 00:17:13,950
Since childhood,

300
00:17:14,309 --> 00:17:17,470
my schooling, relationships,

301
00:17:18,069 --> 00:17:19,270
everything has been arranged

302
00:17:19,270 --> 00:17:21,710
by my parents and brother.

303
00:17:22,629 --> 00:17:23,629
If I confront them,

304
00:17:23,629 --> 00:17:24,789
they just tell me

305
00:17:24,990 --> 00:17:26,670
this is the best arrangement.

306
00:17:27,789 --> 00:17:29,470
They never care about what I want.

307
00:17:30,990 --> 00:17:32,789
Doesn't everyone face such dilemmas?

308
00:17:34,190 --> 00:17:35,389
Take me, for example.

309
00:17:35,389 --> 00:17:36,869
When my parents divorced,

310
00:17:36,869 --> 00:17:39,389
they fought for my custody.
No one asked what I wanted.

311
00:17:44,910 --> 00:17:45,510
I know.

312
00:17:48,309 --> 00:17:49,230
Saying these things

313
00:17:49,910 --> 00:17:51,389
must make me sound overly sensitive.

314
00:17:52,750 --> 00:17:53,416
You'll think

315
00:17:53,710 --> 00:17:55,589
it's easy for me to say.

316
00:17:55,750 --> 00:17:57,430
I'm enjoying privileges but complaining.

317
00:17:58,349 --> 00:18:00,670
I'm being ungrateful.

318
00:18:01,270 --> 00:18:03,629
I'm being unreasonable.

319
00:18:04,069 --> 00:18:06,270
You're getting talkative when drunk.

320
00:18:07,309 --> 00:18:08,670
Don't interrupt. Listen.

321
00:18:12,629 --> 00:18:14,470
When Li Ke yelled at me yesterday,

322
00:18:15,470 --> 00:18:17,470
I was absolutely furious.

323
00:18:18,910 --> 00:18:20,950
But I wasn't angry at him.

324
00:18:21,910 --> 00:18:23,309
I was angry at myself.

325
00:18:23,829 --> 00:18:26,030
I think he was absolutely right.

326
00:18:27,349 --> 00:18:28,829
I'm just useless.

327
00:18:31,149 --> 00:18:33,430
You have time and energy

328
00:18:34,069 --> 00:18:36,109
to throw tantrums and argue,

329
00:18:36,549 --> 00:18:38,670
but have you ever considered

330
00:18:39,549 --> 00:18:40,869
standing up and fighting back?

331
00:18:42,829 --> 00:18:43,629
Fight back?

332
00:18:46,109 --> 00:18:46,750
Open your eyes.

333
00:18:49,829 --> 00:18:50,349
Come on.

334
00:18:51,789 --> 00:18:53,069
Yan Fei, don't sleep here.

335
00:18:55,190 --> 00:18:55,816
Wake up.

336
00:19:04,230 --> 00:19:06,470
You have to help me, Jiatong.

337
00:19:08,549 --> 00:19:10,069
I can't hold on...

338
00:19:10,876 --> 00:19:13,020
(Yan Fei)

339
00:19:13,820 --> 00:19:14,696
(Yan Fei)

340
00:19:25,628 --> 00:19:27,304
(Yan Fei)

341
00:19:27,304 --> 00:19:28,008
(Yan Fei)

342
00:19:42,430 --> 00:19:43,789
Hello, Yan Fei. It's Ren Jiatong.

343
00:19:44,349 --> 00:19:45,389
Guo Xiaoyu's wasted.

344
00:19:45,389 --> 00:19:46,430
Her phone's right here.

345
00:19:47,149 --> 00:19:47,784
Hello?

346
00:19:48,069 --> 00:19:48,789
It's Jiang Chen.

347
00:19:48,990 --> 00:19:50,309
Yan Fei is with me.

348
00:19:51,430 --> 00:19:51,990
Are you

349
00:19:53,349 --> 00:19:54,216
celebrating together?

350
00:19:55,389 --> 00:19:55,976
Yan Fei.

351
00:19:56,670 --> 00:19:58,030
Hello? She's drunk.

352
00:19:58,230 --> 00:20:00,510
I don't know where she lives.
Can you come help?

353
00:20:01,030 --> 00:20:01,670
Where are you?

354
00:20:04,270 --> 00:20:04,936
Here.

355
00:20:05,230 --> 00:20:05,832
Sober up.

356
00:20:11,710 --> 00:20:12,230
Your bag.

357
00:20:15,230 --> 00:20:15,750
Listen,

358
00:20:17,030 --> 00:20:18,710
do you also think

359
00:20:19,789 --> 00:20:20,549
I got into Jun An

360
00:20:21,750 --> 00:20:24,270
through a connection,

361
00:20:25,109 --> 00:20:26,149
not my own abilities?

362
00:20:27,549 --> 00:20:30,349
Li Ke... Li Ke always says that.

363
00:20:31,190 --> 00:20:32,149
I never think so.

364
00:20:32,869 --> 00:20:33,480
Really.

365
00:20:37,789 --> 00:20:39,030
You're such a hypocrite.

366
00:20:40,109 --> 00:20:41,470
If you insult me, I'm leaving.

367
00:20:43,389 --> 00:20:43,950
Careful.

368
00:20:45,990 --> 00:20:47,069
Yan Da said

369
00:20:48,230 --> 00:20:49,990
no one can bully me.

370
00:20:51,470 --> 00:20:52,670
But the only one

371
00:20:53,670 --> 00:20:55,030
who ever bullies me is him.

372
00:20:56,349 --> 00:20:57,710
Okay.

373
00:21:03,629 --> 00:21:04,789
Be careful.

374
00:21:10,389 --> 00:21:10,950
Ren Jiatong?

375
00:21:11,869 --> 00:21:12,520
Ren Jiatong?

376
00:21:13,470 --> 00:21:14,309
Over here.

377
00:21:15,190 --> 00:21:16,030
Jiatong.

378
00:21:17,190 --> 00:21:17,750
Jiatong.

379
00:21:30,190 --> 00:21:31,030
Glad you came.

380
00:21:31,069 --> 00:21:32,670
I had no idea how to handle her.

381
00:21:33,670 --> 00:21:35,109
Hope you don't mind me meddling.

382
00:21:35,589 --> 00:21:36,264
What?

383
00:21:40,990 --> 00:21:43,149
Why did she drink so much?
You should stop her.

384
00:21:43,349 --> 00:21:44,589
How could I stop her?

385
00:21:44,710 --> 00:21:46,750
She downed three glasses immediately.

386
00:21:46,829 --> 00:21:48,869
Clearly, she wanted to get wasted.

387
00:21:50,270 --> 00:21:51,190
If you care about her,

388
00:21:51,190 --> 00:21:52,389
don't let her drink like this.

389
00:21:53,869 --> 00:21:54,510
Care about her?

390
00:22:11,910 --> 00:22:12,549
Is she okay?

391
00:22:16,750 --> 00:22:19,869
Why did you
print out Ms. Bai's information

392
00:22:19,869 --> 00:22:20,670
and cases?

393
00:22:22,069 --> 00:22:23,789
I wanted to join Ms. Bai's team before,

394
00:22:23,789 --> 00:22:24,910
so I reviewed them.

395
00:22:30,950 --> 00:22:32,389
Weren't you going home?

396
00:22:32,389 --> 00:22:33,190
Why are you back?

397
00:22:33,389 --> 00:22:34,430
I came back early.

398
00:22:35,030 --> 00:22:36,190
Why aren't you home?

399
00:22:37,710 --> 00:22:39,950
I'm used to
long-distance family reunions.

400
00:22:42,349 --> 00:22:43,349
They both drank a lot,

401
00:22:43,349 --> 00:22:44,230
especially Yan Fei.

402
00:22:44,510 --> 00:22:46,389
She'll feel awful tomorrow morning.

403
00:22:46,430 --> 00:22:47,950
Let me order some hangover medicine.

404
00:22:48,349 --> 00:22:49,470
You're experienced at this.

405
00:22:50,670 --> 00:22:52,470
I had a roommate in college

406
00:22:52,710 --> 00:22:53,789
who drank too much often.

407
00:22:54,230 --> 00:22:55,829
We took turns taking care of him.

408
00:22:57,389 --> 00:23:00,069
The delivery will take at least
an hour. Do you have yogurt?

409
00:23:05,069 --> 00:23:05,789
You should leave.

410
00:23:07,510 --> 00:23:09,389
You shouldn't stay at a girl's place.

411
00:23:25,230 --> 00:23:26,510
Tian Min told me

412
00:23:26,869 --> 00:23:28,270
how impressive you were that day.

413
00:23:28,629 --> 00:23:29,470
One sentence

414
00:23:29,470 --> 00:23:32,309
made Jiang Chen
and Ren Jiatong shut right up.

415
00:23:32,950 --> 00:23:34,230
With these kids,

416
00:23:34,389 --> 00:23:36,789
you need to crack the whip occasionally

417
00:23:37,030 --> 00:23:38,710
to keep them motivated.

418
00:23:39,950 --> 00:23:41,950
You always say the opposite
of what you mean.

419
00:23:42,670 --> 00:23:43,990
I think you actually like them,

420
00:23:44,309 --> 00:23:46,190
or you wouldn't have chosen
two this year.

421
00:23:47,109 --> 00:23:48,109
I like them?

422
00:23:48,629 --> 00:23:49,670
They always cause trouble.

423
00:23:49,670 --> 00:23:50,789
The Warm Nest case

424
00:23:50,789 --> 00:23:52,349
has been driving me crazy.

425
00:23:52,869 --> 00:23:54,389
Yet you claim you don't like them?

426
00:23:55,510 --> 00:23:56,589
You took this case

427
00:23:56,789 --> 00:23:57,789
because of Ren Jiatong.

428
00:24:00,030 --> 00:24:00,789
But then again,

429
00:24:01,750 --> 00:24:02,430
these kids

430
00:24:02,670 --> 00:24:03,829
need proper training.

431
00:24:04,750 --> 00:24:05,510
As the saying goes,

432
00:24:06,510 --> 00:24:07,510
jade requires carving.

433
00:24:08,109 --> 00:24:08,950
The finest raw jade

434
00:24:09,470 --> 00:24:10,349
also needs polishing.

435
00:24:19,430 --> 00:24:20,136
Here,

436
00:24:21,869 --> 00:24:23,069
last one, and I'm going home.

437
00:24:25,069 --> 00:24:25,950
Such a lovely night.

438
00:24:26,069 --> 00:24:26,710
Are you leaving?

439
00:24:28,589 --> 00:24:29,629
On such a lovely night,

440
00:24:29,629 --> 00:24:31,589
if I keep the hottest guy
of Jun An to myself,

441
00:24:32,149 --> 00:24:33,270
people will resent me.

442
00:24:33,789 --> 00:24:34,710
I should leave.

443
00:24:36,230 --> 00:24:38,109
You've drunk. Let me drive you home.

444
00:24:38,349 --> 00:24:39,470
I have a designated driver.

445
00:24:39,470 --> 00:24:40,430
He has arrived.

446
00:24:40,430 --> 00:24:41,789
I need to get back to my daughter.

447
00:24:42,069 --> 00:24:43,190
Go to your next date.

448
00:24:44,309 --> 00:24:45,270
Come on.

449
00:24:45,670 --> 00:24:46,270
Bye.

450
00:25:38,789 --> 00:25:39,470
You're awake.

451
00:25:42,589 --> 00:25:44,549
Your apartment

452
00:25:45,470 --> 00:25:46,869
is small,

453
00:25:47,510 --> 00:25:48,589
but quite cozy.

454
00:25:49,389 --> 00:25:51,789
Though the sofa, curtains,
and floor colors don't match well.

455
00:25:56,109 --> 00:25:57,510
Does your family

456
00:25:57,510 --> 00:25:58,750
all speak bluntly?

457
00:26:00,270 --> 00:26:02,670
Your brother called you
dozens of times last night.

458
00:26:02,789 --> 00:26:03,710
I answered one

459
00:26:03,710 --> 00:26:04,750
to ease his worry.

460
00:26:05,510 --> 00:26:08,109
But he didn't even say thanks.
He just started interrogating me.

461
00:26:08,629 --> 00:26:10,309
He demanded my full name, occupation,

462
00:26:10,309 --> 00:26:11,349
and address.

463
00:26:12,549 --> 00:26:13,349
Don't mind him.

464
00:26:13,349 --> 00:26:13,950
That's so him.

465
00:26:15,149 --> 00:26:17,320
Jiang Chen made me buy this
in case you feel unwell.

466
00:26:19,789 --> 00:26:20,950
Quite thoughtful.

467
00:26:22,230 --> 00:26:23,230
People need time

468
00:26:23,829 --> 00:26:25,030
to understand each other.

469
00:26:25,270 --> 00:26:26,430
After some time,

470
00:26:26,430 --> 00:26:28,349
you'll find him endearing.

471
00:26:34,710 --> 00:26:36,149
Why did you drink so much?

472
00:26:37,990 --> 00:26:38,869
It's complicated.

473
00:26:40,109 --> 00:26:41,160
Alcohol's easy to handle,

474
00:26:41,839 --> 00:26:43,710
but some problems are harder

475
00:26:43,829 --> 00:26:44,750
to solve.

476
00:26:45,710 --> 00:26:47,430
Just communicate clearly.

477
00:26:47,869 --> 00:26:49,670
If only it were that simple.

478
00:26:50,349 --> 00:26:52,069
I know he means well,

479
00:26:52,910 --> 00:26:54,309
but I feel suffocated.

480
00:26:58,829 --> 00:26:59,432
You

481
00:26:59,829 --> 00:27:00,670
don't like him?

482
00:27:02,389 --> 00:27:03,670
I love him more than anyone.

483
00:27:05,149 --> 00:27:05,750
Are you okay?

484
00:27:07,069 --> 00:27:07,910
I'll get a rag.

485
00:27:14,684 --> 00:27:16,936
(Day 1 after Mid-Autumn Festival)

486
00:27:18,876 --> 00:27:20,430
(Drinking Water)

487
00:27:20,430 --> 00:27:21,950
Got any milk left? Give me a bottle.

488
00:27:26,789 --> 00:27:28,109
I stayed up all night

489
00:27:28,309 --> 00:27:30,349
revising Mr. Zhuang's report.

490
00:27:31,030 --> 00:27:31,910
I'm exhausted.

491
00:27:32,829 --> 00:27:34,190
Shouldn't you

492
00:27:34,190 --> 00:27:35,270
have an energy drink?

493
00:27:35,470 --> 00:27:36,470
Milk won't help.

494
00:27:37,149 --> 00:27:38,990
So stingy.
I'll pay you back a whole case.

495
00:27:40,589 --> 00:27:41,470
A truckload of drinks.

496
00:27:41,470 --> 00:27:42,869
Or a planeload?

497
00:27:42,950 --> 00:27:43,950
Why aren't you working?

498
00:27:43,950 --> 00:27:45,430
What were you talking about?

499
00:27:48,230 --> 00:27:50,069
Ren Jiatong, during my case review,

500
00:27:50,069 --> 00:27:51,309
I thought of a new idea.

501
00:27:51,510 --> 00:27:52,776
Let's discuss when you're free.

502
00:27:53,710 --> 00:27:54,389
I'm busy.

503
00:28:00,789 --> 00:28:02,470
You two were getting along before.

504
00:28:03,069 --> 00:28:03,829
Did you upset her?

505
00:28:05,230 --> 00:28:06,389
I guess she is truly busy.

506
00:28:06,430 --> 00:28:07,629
We're the best team now.

507
00:28:15,950 --> 00:28:17,470
Let me know

508
00:28:18,030 --> 00:28:18,710
when you're free.

509
00:28:19,990 --> 00:28:20,750
Whatever.

510
00:28:23,910 --> 00:28:25,589
Doesn't look like the best team.

511
00:28:26,990 --> 00:28:27,869
We were yesterday.

512
00:28:30,430 --> 00:28:31,688
What's with the sudden change?

513
00:28:32,629 --> 00:28:33,589
She is being jealous.

514
00:28:34,270 --> 00:28:35,030
Is she?

515
00:28:35,510 --> 00:28:36,869
You know who we're talking about?

516
00:28:37,309 --> 00:28:37,928
Doesn't matter.

517
00:28:39,030 --> 00:28:39,869
The point is,

518
00:28:42,190 --> 00:28:42,789
I know women.

519
00:28:49,270 --> 00:28:50,230
Here's a new task.

520
00:28:50,829 --> 00:28:52,549
(Theme: Third Round Task)
(Jun An will represent Warm Nest)

521
00:28:52,549 --> 00:28:53,629
(to respond to)

522
00:28:53,629 --> 00:28:56,270
(class-action lawsuit
against Warm Nest Apartments.)

523
00:28:56,629 --> 00:28:59,400
(If you were on this case, please draft
a litigation assessment plan.)

524
00:28:59,629 --> 00:29:01,549
(Case details are
in the email attachment.)

525
00:29:02,349 --> 00:29:04,149
Why is Jun An taking Warm Nest's case?

526
00:29:04,470 --> 00:29:05,149
They made me

527
00:29:05,149 --> 00:29:06,750
get kicked out by my landlord

528
00:29:06,750 --> 00:29:07,829
on my first day in Beijing!

529
00:29:07,869 --> 00:29:09,589
Six months' rent was gone!

530
00:29:09,829 --> 00:29:10,829
Jiatong is also a victim.

531
00:29:11,230 --> 00:29:12,270
It's not just us two.

532
00:29:12,710 --> 00:29:14,710
Countless people got scammed
and became homeless!

533
00:29:15,109 --> 00:29:16,349
Now they want us

534
00:29:16,349 --> 00:29:17,109
to defend bad guys?

535
00:29:17,109 --> 00:29:17,750
No way!

536
00:29:19,629 --> 00:29:20,710
Calm down.

537
00:29:20,710 --> 00:29:22,789
This is just a task.
Don't take it so personally!

538
00:29:22,789 --> 00:29:24,829
I lost years' worth
of scholarship money!

539
00:29:24,829 --> 00:29:25,829
How can I stay calm?

540
00:29:26,950 --> 00:29:28,069
Anyway, I can't do this.

541
00:29:28,309 --> 00:29:29,149
I'd rather quit

542
00:29:29,470 --> 00:29:30,389
than lose my conscience

543
00:29:30,389 --> 00:29:31,270
for this dirty work!

544
00:29:31,629 --> 00:29:32,360
Xiaoyu.

545
00:29:32,910 --> 00:29:34,109
My aunt is also a victim.

546
00:29:34,990 --> 00:29:36,149
As law students,

547
00:29:36,470 --> 00:29:38,149
we shouldn't approach issues with bias.

548
00:29:40,829 --> 00:29:42,389
Enlighten me then, top student.

549
00:29:45,430 --> 00:29:46,270
Calm down.

550
00:29:46,270 --> 00:29:47,510
Don't get Jiang Chen wrong.

551
00:29:47,950 --> 00:29:49,629
You called Warm Nest bad guys,

552
00:29:49,629 --> 00:29:50,869
which sounds emotional.

553
00:29:51,309 --> 00:29:52,109
In this case,

554
00:29:52,109 --> 00:29:54,470
things went wrong
during capital operations,

555
00:29:54,789 --> 00:29:56,389
causing widespread collateral damage.

556
00:29:56,829 --> 00:29:58,030
No company wants

557
00:29:58,030 --> 00:29:59,869
to lose money intentionally.

558
00:30:00,109 --> 00:30:01,589
Yes, I should see it legally.

559
00:30:01,670 --> 00:30:02,950
But I have feelings!

560
00:30:03,430 --> 00:30:04,950
In our tenant group chat,

561
00:30:05,349 --> 00:30:06,670
some couldn't afford new rentals

562
00:30:06,670 --> 00:30:07,750
and returned to hometowns.

563
00:30:08,030 --> 00:30:09,710
Others clashed with landlords

564
00:30:09,710 --> 00:30:10,789
and got arrested.

565
00:30:10,990 --> 00:30:12,470
Some begged for time off work

566
00:30:12,470 --> 00:30:14,069
just for apartment hunt.

567
00:30:14,589 --> 00:30:16,069
You say Warm Nest isn't bad?

568
00:30:16,349 --> 00:30:17,629
What did those people do wrong?

569
00:30:18,856 --> 00:30:19,430
I'm sorry,

570
00:30:19,430 --> 00:30:21,149
but I can only empathize with them.

571
00:30:21,149 --> 00:30:21,990
I can't sympathize

572
00:30:21,990 --> 00:30:23,149
with wealthy corporations.

573
00:30:32,389 --> 00:30:33,430
Anyway,

574
00:30:34,190 --> 00:30:35,710
Jiatong and I won't do this task.

575
00:30:39,950 --> 00:30:40,648
Ms. Bai.

576
00:30:41,030 --> 00:30:42,549
I've scheduled meetings with Warm Nest

577
00:30:42,549 --> 00:30:43,190
next week.

578
00:30:43,629 --> 00:30:44,990
Regarding the tenants...

579
00:30:45,349 --> 00:30:45,896
Ms. Bai.

580
00:30:46,430 --> 00:30:46,984
Ms. Tian.

581
00:30:47,789 --> 00:30:49,069
I'd like your advice

582
00:30:49,069 --> 00:30:50,710
on the Warm Nest case.

583
00:30:53,149 --> 00:30:54,430
If you're here

584
00:30:55,069 --> 00:30:57,349
to echo Guo Xiaoyu's idealistic speeches
about justice

585
00:30:57,349 --> 00:30:58,629
and corporate accountability,

586
00:30:58,710 --> 00:30:59,549
save your breath.

587
00:30:59,829 --> 00:31:01,230
Jun An doesn't force anyone.

588
00:31:01,510 --> 00:31:03,510
You're free to decline this assignment

589
00:31:03,990 --> 00:31:05,589
or quit the Talent Hunt Program.

590
00:31:06,190 --> 00:31:07,069
I won't quit.

591
00:31:07,789 --> 00:31:08,670
Nor will I back down.

592
00:31:09,230 --> 00:31:10,549
Because I am a tenant,

593
00:31:10,549 --> 00:31:12,149
I understand tenants best.

594
00:31:12,510 --> 00:31:14,789
I'm confident
in creating an effective plan.

595
00:31:15,430 --> 00:31:17,950
Here's my preliminary research.

596
00:31:18,430 --> 00:31:20,950
I've drafted negotiation points.

597
00:31:21,309 --> 00:31:21,990
Please review it.

598
00:31:21,990 --> 00:31:22,990
(Preliminary Individual Analysis Report
on Warm Nest Dispute)

599
00:31:22,990 --> 00:31:24,309
Although tenants

600
00:31:24,309 --> 00:31:25,789
keep filing lawsuits,

601
00:31:26,069 --> 00:31:28,230
litigation benefits neither side.

602
00:31:28,549 --> 00:31:29,270
I believe

603
00:31:29,470 --> 00:31:31,789
the best solution is

604
00:31:31,869 --> 00:31:33,069
to mediate a settlement.

605
00:31:35,931 --> 00:31:37,704
(Preliminary Thoughts
and Negotiation Points)

606
00:31:38,869 --> 00:31:40,510
Proactivity is commendable.

607
00:31:42,549 --> 00:31:44,190
But these negotiation points,

608
00:31:44,430 --> 00:31:45,510
whose interests

609
00:31:45,510 --> 00:31:46,589
do they protect?

610
00:31:46,750 --> 00:31:49,430
Where's the practical framework
to reach mediation?

611
00:31:49,430 --> 00:31:50,349
I see none of that.

612
00:31:50,869 --> 00:31:51,549
Because

613
00:31:51,910 --> 00:31:54,750
I only saw hollow legal jargon.

614
00:31:55,629 --> 00:31:56,829
You produced conclusions

615
00:31:56,829 --> 00:31:58,069
without investigation.

616
00:31:58,710 --> 00:32:00,270
What a waste of your advantage

617
00:32:00,270 --> 00:32:01,270
as an aggrieved tenant.

618
00:32:02,069 --> 00:32:02,829
Sorry, Ms. Bai.

619
00:32:03,309 --> 00:32:05,270
This was just a preliminary idea.

620
00:32:05,829 --> 00:32:07,510
If it's just a preliminary idea,

621
00:32:07,510 --> 00:32:09,270
you shouldn't have
wasted my time with it.

622
00:32:09,629 --> 00:32:10,230
Get back to it,

623
00:32:10,230 --> 00:32:11,910
make this proposal more comprehensive

624
00:32:12,149 --> 00:32:13,470
and email it to the right people.

625
00:32:14,549 --> 00:32:15,149
Understood.

626
00:32:19,629 --> 00:32:20,549
That girl is good.

627
00:32:21,309 --> 00:32:23,750
Many second or third-year lawyers
couldn't do better than her.

628
00:32:24,750 --> 00:32:25,510
Moreover,

629
00:32:26,069 --> 00:32:27,470
her approach

630
00:32:27,470 --> 00:32:29,950
aligns perfectly with yours.

631
00:32:31,270 --> 00:32:32,309
She's got some talent.

632
00:32:34,430 --> 00:32:37,710
But why does she
feel more like your actual student?

633
00:32:38,549 --> 00:32:41,109
You even guided her to conduct research.

634
00:32:42,750 --> 00:32:43,869
I'm getting jealous.

635
00:32:44,549 --> 00:32:45,430
After becoming a mom,

636
00:32:45,430 --> 00:32:46,309
you become childish.

637
00:32:49,069 --> 00:32:50,349
But you're being much stricter

638
00:32:50,829 --> 00:32:52,270
with her than you were with me.

639
00:32:53,109 --> 00:32:54,470
That makes me feel better.

640
00:32:55,710 --> 00:32:57,389
Are you indirectly criticizing me?

641
00:32:59,389 --> 00:33:00,190
I wouldn't dare.

642
00:33:05,430 --> 00:33:06,470
The harsher you scold,

643
00:33:06,470 --> 00:33:07,389
the more you care.

644
00:33:08,990 --> 00:33:10,030
I'm about to lose favor.

645
00:33:17,549 --> 00:33:18,389
You've got the email.

646
00:33:19,270 --> 00:33:20,389
I know everyone still

647
00:33:20,629 --> 00:33:22,670
has tasks assigned by your mentors.

648
00:33:22,869 --> 00:33:23,910
That's the first.

649
00:33:24,200 --> 00:33:25,389
(Case Overview)
But the Warm Nest case

650
00:33:25,629 --> 00:33:27,270
(Prepare a litigation evaluation plan)
is the key assessment task.

651
00:33:27,589 --> 00:33:29,270
You can work on both concurrently.

652
00:33:29,869 --> 00:33:30,430
Work on both?

653
00:33:30,789 --> 00:33:31,304
Exactly.

654
00:33:32,309 --> 00:33:33,990
Involving everyone in multiple cases

655
00:33:34,470 --> 00:33:35,670
and progressing them

656
00:33:36,109 --> 00:33:36,910
better reflects

657
00:33:37,270 --> 00:33:38,950
real-world legal practice.

658
00:33:39,470 --> 00:33:40,040
Additionally,

659
00:33:40,349 --> 00:33:41,950
Jun An encourages you all to engage

660
00:33:42,109 --> 00:33:45,430
with actual cases and approaches
within your capabilities.

661
00:33:45,869 --> 00:33:46,750
It builds experience

662
00:33:47,470 --> 00:33:48,389
and accelerates growth.

663
00:33:48,990 --> 00:33:49,640
Mr. Zhou.

664
00:33:49,829 --> 00:33:51,869
What's the point value for the case?

665
00:33:52,069 --> 00:33:52,950
Is it individual?

666
00:33:53,149 --> 00:33:53,789
Sure.

667
00:33:54,030 --> 00:33:56,309
Points remain 30, 20, 10
across three tiers.

668
00:33:57,230 --> 00:33:59,349
Let me add some pressure.

669
00:34:00,309 --> 00:34:01,270
I've heard

670
00:34:01,270 --> 00:34:03,589
that someone has drafted a plan.

671
00:34:05,030 --> 00:34:06,629
Who works that fast?

672
00:34:07,910 --> 00:34:09,990
This shows this person focuses on

673
00:34:09,990 --> 00:34:10,629
hot issues,

674
00:34:10,910 --> 00:34:11,549
enjoys thinking,

675
00:34:12,109 --> 00:34:12,990
and has legal passion.

676
00:34:13,352 --> 00:34:13,910
(Case Overview)

677
00:34:13,910 --> 00:34:14,990
A role model indeed.

678
00:34:17,149 --> 00:34:18,069
Ms. Tian just mentioned

679
00:34:18,510 --> 00:34:19,149
you did well.

680
00:34:20,870 --> 00:34:22,149
That was just encouragement.

681
00:34:22,870 --> 00:34:25,109
Ms. Bai wasn't fully satisfied
with my proposal.

682
00:34:28,269 --> 00:34:28,808
Alright.

683
00:34:28,950 --> 00:34:30,664
Any other questions? Meeting's over.

684
00:34:30,830 --> 00:34:31,400
Mr. Zhou.

685
00:34:32,549 --> 00:34:33,229
I have a concern.

686
00:34:33,510 --> 00:34:34,120
Speak.

687
00:34:36,549 --> 00:34:37,589
I want to quit.

688
00:34:38,620 --> 00:34:39,688
(Case Overview)

689
00:34:47,149 --> 00:34:47,709
Xiaoyu.

690
00:34:57,629 --> 00:34:58,280
Guo Xiaoyu.

691
00:35:08,629 --> 00:35:09,192
Guo Xiaoyu.

692
00:35:09,350 --> 00:35:10,830
If you have problems, share them.

693
00:35:11,109 --> 00:35:12,669
We'll help find solutions.

694
00:35:13,030 --> 00:35:14,510
But withdrawing from this task

695
00:35:14,510 --> 00:35:15,229
means no points.

696
00:35:15,669 --> 00:35:17,669
You know you would be eliminated, right?

697
00:35:21,510 --> 00:35:22,310
Thank you, Mr. Zhou.

698
00:35:23,269 --> 00:35:23,990
I've decided.

699
00:35:25,510 --> 00:35:26,790
This isn't just about you.

700
00:35:27,510 --> 00:35:28,470
Have you told Mr. Song?

701
00:35:29,830 --> 00:35:31,229
He's your mentor.

702
00:35:31,589 --> 00:35:33,189
You can't quit without consulting him.

703
00:35:34,760 --> 00:35:35,350
I'll...

704
00:35:35,350 --> 00:35:37,030
Pretend this conversation
never happened.

705
00:35:38,189 --> 00:35:39,390
Mr. Song will be back soon.

706
00:35:39,589 --> 00:35:41,669
Report to him personally then.

707
00:35:42,229 --> 00:35:44,109
Until then, focus on your proposal.

708
00:35:46,030 --> 00:35:48,510
As someone who's been there,

709
00:35:48,790 --> 00:35:50,109
not as a mentor,

710
00:35:50,149 --> 00:35:50,920
let me advise you.

711
00:35:51,790 --> 00:35:53,229
While you're at Jun An,

712
00:35:53,510 --> 00:35:54,269
any job you receive

713
00:35:54,830 --> 00:35:55,790
must be completed.

714
00:35:56,390 --> 00:35:57,390
That's professionalism.

715
00:35:58,069 --> 00:35:58,696
Do you get it?

716
00:36:34,030 --> 00:36:35,069
Why do you help Warm Nest?

717
00:36:37,269 --> 00:36:38,589
I understand your anger.

718
00:36:38,589 --> 00:36:39,790
But I have to do this.

719
00:36:40,549 --> 00:36:41,669
Just to stay at Jun An?

720
00:36:42,549 --> 00:36:43,176
Yes.

721
00:36:44,350 --> 00:36:45,672
But not entirely because of that.

722
00:36:49,030 --> 00:36:50,189
Regarding the Warm Nest case,

723
00:36:50,189 --> 00:36:51,310
you should understand me.

724
00:36:51,749 --> 00:36:53,470
Have you forgotten
the distress and panic

725
00:36:53,470 --> 00:36:54,350
that night?

726
00:36:54,709 --> 00:36:56,669
I stayed in a budget hotel for weeks.

727
00:36:56,669 --> 00:36:58,109
I maxed out all my credit cards.

728
00:36:58,950 --> 00:36:59,830
You almost

729
00:36:59,830 --> 00:37:01,790
got kicked out of Jun An
because of the video

730
00:37:02,709 --> 00:37:04,030
challenging Warm Nest alone.

731
00:37:04,030 --> 00:37:05,149
Have you forgotten all this?

732
00:37:06,790 --> 00:37:08,629
Now you're rushing to submit your plan

733
00:37:08,870 --> 00:37:09,990
to represent Warm Nest

734
00:37:09,990 --> 00:37:11,749
and sue those defenseless tenants

735
00:37:11,749 --> 00:37:12,549
in court.

736
00:37:13,189 --> 00:37:14,549
Won't you have a bad conscience?

737
00:37:14,910 --> 00:37:15,470
Guo Xiaoyu.

738
00:37:16,229 --> 00:37:18,510
A lawyer's duty is
to solve clients' problems.

739
00:37:18,910 --> 00:37:20,830
If you can't grasp this basic concept,

740
00:37:22,149 --> 00:37:23,030
you shouldn't be one.

741
00:37:24,229 --> 00:37:24,950
Listen,

742
00:37:25,790 --> 00:37:27,430
if being a lawyer means helping the rich

743
00:37:27,430 --> 00:37:28,549
bully the weak,

744
00:37:29,069 --> 00:37:30,109
then I will quit.

745
00:37:50,149 --> 00:37:50,696
Yan Fei.

746
00:37:51,669 --> 00:37:52,200
Here.

747
00:37:54,749 --> 00:37:55,390
Where is she?

748
00:37:57,390 --> 00:37:58,109
She took leave.

749
00:37:58,910 --> 00:38:00,310
She's being too reckless this time.

750
00:38:04,470 --> 00:38:06,229
Do you know
how hard it is to rent a place?

751
00:38:07,470 --> 00:38:08,709
You've never rented, have you?

752
00:38:09,790 --> 00:38:10,709
Let me tell you.

753
00:38:11,510 --> 00:38:13,350
First, house hunting is a nightmare.

754
00:38:14,229 --> 00:38:15,976
Shady agents provide
cheap, terrible houses.

755
00:38:16,310 --> 00:38:18,952
Good agents demand one month's deposit
and three months' payment.

756
00:38:19,310 --> 00:38:20,950
Then finding roommates

757
00:38:21,269 --> 00:38:22,470
is like opening mystery boxes

758
00:38:22,470 --> 00:38:23,310
by pure luck.

759
00:38:24,109 --> 00:38:26,109
And landlords raise rents every year.

760
00:38:26,269 --> 00:38:27,310
We have to move then.

761
00:38:27,390 --> 00:38:28,109
It's exhausting.

762
00:38:28,629 --> 00:38:31,310
Guys' sneakers, figurines,

763
00:38:31,669 --> 00:38:33,549
girls' makeup, and plants.

764
00:38:33,950 --> 00:38:35,430
We avoid buying things we love

765
00:38:35,430 --> 00:38:36,749
because moving them is a hassle.

766
00:38:37,390 --> 00:38:38,549
No space to keep them anyway.

767
00:38:39,510 --> 00:38:40,549
Do you understand?

768
00:38:41,629 --> 00:38:42,470
To be honest,

769
00:38:43,149 --> 00:38:43,910
for people like us,

770
00:38:44,310 --> 00:38:46,390
finding a decent apartment

771
00:38:46,390 --> 00:38:47,629
is like winning the lottery.

772
00:38:48,910 --> 00:38:50,149
You're a native Beijinger

773
00:38:50,350 --> 00:38:53,390
with family properties stretching
from Chang'an Avenue to Sunhe.

774
00:38:53,870 --> 00:38:55,109
So don't casually

775
00:38:55,589 --> 00:38:57,589
think people as reckless again.

776
00:38:57,870 --> 00:38:59,830
Li Ke, that's enough.

777
00:39:00,310 --> 00:39:01,749
What does this have to do with Fei?

778
00:39:02,030 --> 00:39:02,830
I didn't mean...

779
00:39:04,189 --> 00:39:04,709
Hey.

780
00:39:10,430 --> 00:39:11,189
I don't understand

781
00:39:11,189 --> 00:39:13,390
why there's such a huge gap
between people.

782
00:39:16,910 --> 00:39:17,990
My elder sister

783
00:39:17,990 --> 00:39:20,030
is the brother-supporter type
that people criticize.

784
00:39:21,109 --> 00:39:23,790
After my sister graduated,
she worked hard to pay for my education.

785
00:39:24,470 --> 00:39:25,832
She cares more about me than Mom.

786
00:39:26,109 --> 00:39:27,229
She saved up money

787
00:39:27,510 --> 00:39:29,189
to support me.

788
00:39:29,350 --> 00:39:30,189
I got everything.

789
00:39:31,350 --> 00:39:32,589
My biggest goal now

790
00:39:32,870 --> 00:39:34,510
is to avoid mistakes,

791
00:39:34,629 --> 00:39:35,749
get the offer,

792
00:39:35,749 --> 00:39:37,229
and save a fortune to repay her.

793
00:39:37,790 --> 00:39:39,870
But I didn't mean to target Yan Fei.

794
00:39:40,910 --> 00:39:42,629
I don't know
what's wrong with me lately.

795
00:39:44,069 --> 00:39:47,149
I get it. We're all
under great pressure.

796
00:39:49,109 --> 00:39:49,990
But honestly,

797
00:39:50,709 --> 00:39:52,310
you should apologize to Yan Fei.

798
00:39:53,069 --> 00:39:54,549
She worked through holidays,

799
00:39:55,030 --> 00:39:57,350
stayed up nights revising our report,

800
00:39:57,350 --> 00:39:58,030
and submitted it.

801
00:39:58,390 --> 00:40:00,149
She even put our names first.

802
00:40:03,963 --> 00:40:06,152
(Jointly completed
by Huang Yue, Li Ke, Yan Fei)

803
00:40:14,907 --> 00:40:18,568
(Re: Revised Case Review Transcript
From: Bai Xiao; To: Jiang Chen)

804
00:40:18,568 --> 00:40:21,704
(Jiang Chen, please continue
adjusting the case notes.)

805
00:40:21,704 --> 00:40:22,390
Ren Jiatong.

806
00:40:22,390 --> 00:40:24,229
Did Ms. Bai ask you
to adjust your case notes?

807
00:40:24,830 --> 00:40:25,510
Not yet.

808
00:40:31,390 --> 00:40:32,749
Why? Are you feeling unwell?

809
00:40:33,830 --> 00:40:34,350
No.

810
00:40:35,669 --> 00:40:37,030
Speak up if you're unwell.

811
00:40:37,109 --> 00:40:37,870
Don't tough it out.

812
00:40:41,629 --> 00:40:42,229
Jiang Chen.

813
00:40:42,950 --> 00:40:44,430
You shouldn't be concerned about me.

814
00:40:45,109 --> 00:40:48,310
After all, I don't go drinking at night.
I don't need milk either.

815
00:40:48,830 --> 00:40:49,669
So don't worry.

816
00:40:55,549 --> 00:40:56,390
What's going on?

817
00:41:00,229 --> 00:41:00,840
Ms. Bai.

818
00:41:01,189 --> 00:41:01,864
Ms. Bai.

819
00:41:02,069 --> 00:41:02,589
Excuse me,

820
00:41:03,109 --> 00:41:04,510
could I ask you something?

821
00:41:05,510 --> 00:41:07,790
I've revised the case notes twice.

822
00:41:07,870 --> 00:41:09,069
I just received your email

823
00:41:09,069 --> 00:41:10,149
about a third revision.

824
00:41:10,709 --> 00:41:12,390
I don't know what's wrong with them.

825
00:41:12,910 --> 00:41:13,629
Moreover, I think

826
00:41:13,629 --> 00:41:15,709
if I keep working on case notes,

827
00:41:15,709 --> 00:41:16,430
it will

828
00:41:16,430 --> 00:41:18,109
affect my schedule for subsequent tasks.

829
00:41:18,510 --> 00:41:19,470
It isn't efficient.

830
00:41:19,870 --> 00:41:21,629
If you can't even handle case notes,

831
00:41:22,069 --> 00:41:23,510
how can you do the Warm Nest case?

832
00:41:24,589 --> 00:41:26,430
I don't see
how these two things are related.

833
00:41:28,790 --> 00:41:29,352
Ms. Bai,

834
00:41:29,870 --> 00:41:31,990
the case notes review is a shared job.

835
00:41:32,149 --> 00:41:33,350
We'll complete it together.

836
00:41:35,749 --> 00:41:37,709
Ms. Bai, you have a meeting later.

837
00:41:38,189 --> 00:41:39,910
Let me handle this.

838
00:41:40,549 --> 00:41:41,149
Jiang Chen,

839
00:41:41,430 --> 00:41:43,149
if you truly think

840
00:41:43,350 --> 00:41:45,109
you've learned nothing
from the case review,

841
00:41:45,950 --> 00:41:47,269
I suggest you switch teams.

842
00:41:56,870 --> 00:41:57,910
Come with me.

843
00:42:03,549 --> 00:42:05,030
You've got some nerve, kid.

844
00:42:05,589 --> 00:42:06,549
Go ask Zhou Nian

845
00:42:06,990 --> 00:42:08,069
when we were rookies,

846
00:42:08,310 --> 00:42:09,870
who dared speak to mentors like that?

847
00:42:10,470 --> 00:42:11,229
Want to get fired?

848
00:42:13,149 --> 00:42:13,896
Ms. Tian.

849
00:42:14,350 --> 00:42:16,030
I genuinely don't know what I did wrong.

850
00:42:16,189 --> 00:42:16,950
Why is Ms. Bai

851
00:42:17,790 --> 00:42:18,430
torturing me?

852
00:42:20,910 --> 00:42:22,709
Ms. Bai doesn't have time
to torture you.

853
00:42:23,830 --> 00:42:24,510
In our team,

854
00:42:24,510 --> 00:42:25,510
starting from Ms. Bai,

855
00:42:25,669 --> 00:42:26,629
every single member

856
00:42:27,069 --> 00:42:28,069
has been there.

857
00:42:28,669 --> 00:42:29,830
Having you review case files

858
00:42:29,910 --> 00:42:31,669
is to make you know
what case files look like

859
00:42:31,950 --> 00:42:33,149
and see evidence materials.

860
00:42:33,510 --> 00:42:35,310
If you don't personally read
page by page

861
00:42:35,310 --> 00:42:36,390
and word by word,

862
00:42:36,749 --> 00:42:38,248
you'll never gain visual perceptions.

863
00:42:38,709 --> 00:42:40,510
You want to be a trial lawyer,

864
00:42:40,870 --> 00:42:43,269
so you need
to know every detail of the case files

865
00:42:43,269 --> 00:42:44,149
very well.

866
00:42:44,629 --> 00:42:46,069
Regarding evidence materials,

867
00:42:46,430 --> 00:42:48,390
you must review every single word.

868
00:42:48,589 --> 00:42:50,950
Only then can you
understand both sides in court

869
00:42:51,069 --> 00:42:52,390
and handle things effortlessly.

870
00:42:54,749 --> 00:42:55,950
Case notes review,

871
00:42:56,269 --> 00:42:57,030
document drafting,

872
00:42:57,510 --> 00:42:59,470
evidence examination,
debate, and communication

873
00:43:00,030 --> 00:43:02,470
are the five fundamental skills
for litigation lawyers.

874
00:43:02,990 --> 00:43:05,229
Are you already giving up
at the first step?

875
00:43:06,030 --> 00:43:08,310
The problem is,
I've spent a week on the case file

876
00:43:09,030 --> 00:43:10,189
and revised it twice.

877
00:43:11,350 --> 00:43:12,709
I don't know how to do it again.

878
00:43:15,515 --> 00:43:17,576
(Should lawyers defend "bad people"?)

879
00:43:17,576 --> 00:43:19,784
(Lawyers' duty is to protect clients'
lawful rights based on facts and law,)

880
00:43:19,784 --> 00:43:21,768
(not merely speaking
for the "bad people".)

881
00:43:21,768 --> 00:43:22,548
(The right to defense is)

882
00:43:22,548 --> 00:43:23,944
(a constitutional entitlement
for defendants.)

883
00:43:23,944 --> 00:43:25,960
(Especially in criminal cases,
guarding everyone's right to defense)

884
00:43:25,960 --> 00:43:28,040
(is essential to ensure fairness
and prevent wrongful convictions.)
