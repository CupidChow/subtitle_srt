=No. 1 For You Special Edition=

13
00:00:49,580 --> 00:00:51,250
Gao Shi De. I'm serious!

14
00:00:51,250 --> 00:00:52,280
Stop it!

15
00:00:57,050 --> 00:01:00,720
Zhou Shu Yi likes Gao Shi De!

16
00:01:01,490 --> 00:01:03,790
Very much!

17
00:01:21,540 --> 00:01:23,280
Damn.

18
00:01:23,280 --> 00:01:24,880
I'm off duty.

19
00:01:25,550 --> 00:01:26,880
You caught me while I was having fun drinking.

20
00:01:30,620 --> 00:01:31,420
You guys!

21
00:01:31,420 --> 00:01:33,690
-Will you just leave me alone?
-Ouch!

22
00:01:33,690 --> 00:01:34,620
Easy!

23
00:01:38,060 --> 00:01:40,330
Displaying affection in front of me?

24
00:01:42,030 --> 00:01:43,530
I'd like to introduce to you

25
00:01:43,530 --> 00:01:45,330
your future cousin-in-law.

26
00:01:45,330 --> 00:01:46,400
Zhou Shu Yi.

27
00:01:47,600 --> 00:01:48,400
And he

28
00:01:48,400 --> 00:01:50,570
is my cousin, Pei Shou Yi.

29
00:01:51,910 --> 00:01:55,310
You're his cousin, why did you pretend to love him?

30
00:01:55,310 --> 00:01:56,080
It made me...

31
00:01:56,080 --> 00:01:57,080
What?

32
00:01:58,180 --> 00:01:59,010
Jealous?

33
00:02:00,650 --> 00:02:02,050
Annoying.

34
00:02:02,050 --> 00:02:02,880
All right.

35
00:02:02,880 --> 00:02:04,590
Leave him alone.

36
00:02:04,590 --> 00:02:05,420
Couldn't bear to watch?

37
00:02:05,420 --> 00:02:06,720
Yeah.

38
00:02:07,690 --> 00:02:09,090
Whatever.

39
00:02:10,890 --> 00:02:13,560
I'm tired of looking out for you kids.

40
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:17,630
I think I should do something for myself.

41
00:02:20,340 --> 00:02:21,470
It's on me today.

42
00:02:21,470 --> 00:02:22,200
No need.

43
00:02:24,470 --> 00:02:25,370
Same old.

44
00:02:27,110 --> 00:02:27,980
So?

45
00:02:28,440 --> 00:02:29,840
That couple

46
00:02:30,780 --> 00:02:33,280
reminds you of how lonely you are?

47
00:02:33,750 --> 00:02:35,380
That's nice.

48
00:02:35,820 --> 00:02:37,490
I want somebody to love.

49
00:02:40,660 --> 00:02:41,120
Here.

50
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:51,130
You shift your occupation
from the owner of a restaurant and bar

51
00:02:52,100 --> 00:02:53,900
to a psychologist?

52
00:03:12,490 --> 00:03:13,350
People...

53
00:03:14,190 --> 00:03:15,660
often forget how painful it was

54
00:03:16,960 --> 00:03:18,190
once the wound is healed.

55
00:03:19,360 --> 00:03:22,260
Dopamine takes control of
the brain of people in love,

56
00:03:22,730 --> 00:03:24,800
easily weakening their ability to think,

57
00:03:25,730 --> 00:03:27,270
until they are faced with

58
00:03:27,940 --> 00:03:29,900
the cruel reality.

59
00:03:31,840 --> 00:03:34,180
Sometimes, letting go
is harder than having a breakup.

60
00:03:35,580 --> 00:03:37,250
Breaking up is because love has disappeared.

61
00:03:39,310 --> 00:03:40,720
But one can't just let go

62
00:03:42,780 --> 00:03:44,650
because there's still love.

63
00:04:00,570 --> 00:04:01,900
You have so much free time.

64
00:04:03,440 --> 00:04:05,470
How about teaching me, a psychologist,

65
00:04:06,140 --> 00:04:08,780
to run a restaurant and bar to compete with yours.

66
00:04:25,930 --> 00:04:27,530
-Would you like some noodles?
-OK.

67
00:04:40,380 --> 00:04:41,910
When did they get together?

68
00:04:42,880 --> 00:04:44,810
I wondered why I hadn't seen Bing Wei

69
00:04:44,810 --> 00:04:46,410
in our department lately.

70
00:04:47,020 --> 00:04:48,520
He was there for you.

71
00:04:52,920 --> 00:04:53,860
I mean...

72
00:04:53,860 --> 00:04:56,560
he might be there for some club activities.

73
00:05:05,330 --> 00:05:06,870
Gao Shi De.

74
00:05:06,870 --> 00:05:09,140
You're spoiling him.

75
00:05:09,140 --> 00:05:10,170
Really?

76
00:05:10,170 --> 00:05:12,840
The shrimp, the vegetable, and the drinks.

77
00:05:12,840 --> 00:05:14,180
Why don't you just feed him?

78
00:05:14,180 --> 00:05:15,680
Why didn't you do that for me?

79
00:05:15,680 --> 00:05:16,940
Here.

80
00:05:16,940 --> 00:05:17,610
Come on.

81
00:05:26,390 --> 00:05:27,690
Keep an eye on her.

82
00:05:27,690 --> 00:05:29,590
She's two years older than us,

83
00:05:29,590 --> 00:05:31,630
but still acting like a child.

84
00:05:32,660 --> 00:05:33,560
All right.

85
00:05:33,560 --> 00:05:34,660
Leave him alone.

86
00:05:40,770 --> 00:05:43,000
I'll leave Shu Yi to you now.

87
00:05:45,670 --> 00:05:46,770
You know

88
00:05:46,770 --> 00:05:48,610
he's short-tempered.

89
00:05:48,610 --> 00:05:50,350
If he ever gets mad at you,

90
00:05:51,410 --> 00:05:52,480
don't take it to heart.

91
00:05:54,680 --> 00:05:55,950
I know.

92
00:05:57,120 --> 00:05:58,190
Don't worry.

93
00:05:58,190 --> 00:05:59,650
I'll take care of him.

94
00:05:59,650 --> 00:06:01,190
Wait a minute.

95
00:06:01,190 --> 00:06:03,420
What do you guys mean?

96
00:06:03,420 --> 00:06:04,590
Am I that hard to deal with?

97
00:06:07,800 --> 00:06:09,060
You didn't know?

98
00:06:09,060 --> 00:06:11,000
You're the reason why we're dating.

99
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:14,340
Well.

100
00:06:14,340 --> 00:06:16,070
You know, we talked about you all the time.

101
00:06:16,070 --> 00:06:17,040
And...

102
00:06:17,940 --> 00:06:19,570
then we fell for each other.

103
00:06:22,810 --> 00:06:25,110
You owe me a thank you.

104
00:06:25,110 --> 00:06:27,120
-No way.
-No way!

105
00:06:27,120 --> 00:06:28,050
We were always talking about

106
00:06:28,050 --> 00:06:29,580
how to clean up your ass.

107
00:06:29,580 --> 00:06:30,850
You should thank us

108
00:06:30,850 --> 00:06:32,020
for doing that.

109
00:06:34,260 --> 00:06:35,920
By the way, I'll tell you what...

110
00:06:36,890 --> 00:06:39,560
You still send e-mails to your boyfriend?

111
00:06:40,130 --> 00:06:42,560
Yeah, at least once a week.

112
00:06:43,260 --> 00:06:45,030
So romantic!

113
00:06:45,030 --> 00:06:46,670
And our e-mail addresses

114
00:06:46,670 --> 00:06:47,770
are quite meaningful.

115
00:06:47,770 --> 00:06:49,200
It's the code I used when

116
00:06:49,200 --> 00:06:50,510
I confessed my love to him.

117
00:06:50,510 --> 00:06:51,410
He's not listening.

118
00:06:51,410 --> 00:06:52,610
It's not too late.

119
00:06:52,610 --> 00:06:53,880
Is it?

120
00:06:53,880 --> 00:06:55,210
Run!

121
00:06:59,850 --> 00:07:02,320
We're going to the library tomorrow

122
00:07:02,320 --> 00:07:03,350
to study for the final exam.

123
00:07:03,350 --> 00:07:04,150
Would you like to come?

124
00:07:04,150 --> 00:07:06,450
I'm going to study at Gao Shi De's.

125
00:07:06,450 --> 00:07:09,290
Are you sure you're going to study there?

126
00:07:11,690 --> 00:07:15,130
Jiang Yu Xin, look at your creepy smile.

127
00:07:15,130 --> 00:07:17,500
Make sure you bring the seductive underpants,

128
00:07:17,500 --> 00:07:20,370
just in case.

129
00:07:20,370 --> 00:07:22,100
What are you talking about?

130
00:07:22,100 --> 00:07:23,270
Ignore her.

131
00:07:23,270 --> 00:07:24,410
Get ready for the final exam.

132
00:07:24,410 --> 00:07:25,510
Of course.

133
00:07:25,510 --> 00:07:27,580
I'll beat him this time in the exam.

134
00:07:27,580 --> 00:07:29,710
All right, see you.

135
00:07:29,710 --> 00:07:30,850
Bye.

136
00:07:30,850 --> 00:07:32,080
Bye-Bye.

137
00:07:35,680 --> 00:07:37,290
What's the seductive underpants?

138
00:07:43,546 --> 00:07:45,715
(Seductive underpants)

139
00:08:18,730 --> 00:08:20,160
You're distracted.

140
00:08:23,360 --> 00:08:26,030
How can you be so calm?

141
00:08:32,240 --> 00:08:33,610
What's wrong?

142
00:08:43,720 --> 00:08:45,250
Sit still.

143
00:08:49,260 --> 00:08:50,090
What are you doing?

144
00:08:52,760 --> 00:08:54,760
Now I can focus.

145
00:08:54,760 --> 00:08:55,830
Read your book.

146
00:08:59,670 --> 00:09:00,800
It's upside down.

147
00:09:02,870 --> 00:09:04,470
Aren't you nervous with

148
00:09:04,470 --> 00:09:05,370
the one you like?

149
00:09:07,310 --> 00:09:08,440
Are you?

150
00:09:08,740 --> 00:09:10,380
Why would I be if you're not?

151
00:09:11,050 --> 00:09:12,210
I'm very nervous.

152
00:09:12,650 --> 00:09:13,250
Oh?

153
00:09:13,980 --> 00:09:15,180
So...

154
00:09:15,180 --> 00:09:16,480
I'm just as nervous as you are.

155
00:09:18,050 --> 00:09:19,690
Really?

156
00:09:19,690 --> 00:09:20,520
Yeah.

157
00:09:20,520 --> 00:09:22,320
You bet I am. It's your first time here.

158
00:09:25,330 --> 00:09:28,060
Did I treat you badly?

159
00:09:30,100 --> 00:09:31,670
I wasn't very nice to you, either.

160
00:09:31,670 --> 00:09:32,530
We're even.

161
00:09:33,430 --> 00:09:34,270
Oh?

162
00:09:35,140 --> 00:09:36,240
Doesn't ring a bell.

163
00:09:38,740 --> 00:09:40,910
I took all the first ranks.

164
00:09:43,240 --> 00:09:45,950
Are you trying to provoke me?

165
00:09:45,950 --> 00:09:48,450
I'll beat you this time in the final exam.

166
00:09:48,450 --> 00:09:49,550
Alright.

167
00:09:51,590 --> 00:09:53,090
I have to win, OK?

168
00:09:54,160 --> 00:09:55,190
Why?

169
00:09:58,490 --> 00:09:59,990
Only in this way

170
00:09:59,990 --> 00:10:01,530
will you keep focusing on me.

171
00:10:02,260 --> 00:10:04,230
How much do you like me?

172
00:10:05,970 --> 00:10:07,340
A lot.

173
00:10:08,100 --> 00:10:11,210
I like you too much to be rational.

174
00:10:12,140 --> 00:10:14,780
I still feel like I'm dreaming.

175
00:10:14,780 --> 00:10:16,640
I can't believe that you actually like me.

176
00:10:23,720 --> 00:10:26,390
Mama's home, son!

177
00:10:27,190 --> 00:10:27,790
Mom.

178
00:10:28,760 --> 00:10:29,720
Hi, auntie.

179
00:10:31,430 --> 00:10:32,560
I'm Zhou Shu Yi.

180
00:10:37,970 --> 00:10:38,830
Hello.

181
00:10:39,330 --> 00:10:41,300
I'm Shi De's mom.

182
00:10:42,900 --> 00:10:44,470
Nice sofa, huh?

183
00:10:46,240 --> 00:10:47,440
I'll go inside first.

184
00:10:50,680 --> 00:10:52,850
Hi, I'm Gao Shi De.

185
00:10:56,180 --> 00:10:58,090
I thought you said you would be working late.

186
00:10:58,090 --> 00:11:00,050
I was very productive today.

187
00:11:00,050 --> 00:11:01,520
And I finished early.

188
00:11:01,520 --> 00:11:03,990
I didn't know you were bringing your friend home.

189
00:11:03,990 --> 00:11:05,630
Am I interrupting you?

190
00:11:05,630 --> 00:11:07,090
(What should I do?)

191
00:11:07,090 --> 00:11:09,560
(Will his mother hate me?)

192
00:11:10,230 --> 00:11:11,430
Shu Yi.

193
00:11:12,330 --> 00:11:13,770
Why don't you study in the room

194
00:11:13,770 --> 00:11:15,670
with Shi De?

195
00:11:15,670 --> 00:11:18,040
I'll make you a nice dinner later.

196
00:11:18,040 --> 00:11:19,210
Thank you, auntie.

197
00:11:21,410 --> 00:11:22,140
Go.

198
00:11:22,140 --> 00:11:24,380
Don't get in my way.

199
00:11:27,210 --> 00:11:28,580
Go to my room.

200
00:11:29,320 --> 00:11:30,350
Get the books.

201
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:42,160
All right.

202
00:11:45,730 --> 00:11:46,970
Come on.

203
00:11:47,330 --> 00:11:50,100
Have a try, please.

204
00:11:52,170 --> 00:11:54,610
What's wrong? You don't like sweet and sour ribs?

205
00:11:54,610 --> 00:11:56,010
-Or would you like some...
-It's not that.

206
00:11:56,840 --> 00:11:58,680
It just reminded me

207
00:11:59,150 --> 00:12:01,250
of my mom doing the same thing for me
when I was a kid.

208
00:12:04,990 --> 00:12:06,020
Well, have some more.

209
00:12:06,020 --> 00:12:07,960
Save the etiquette, alright?

210
00:12:07,960 --> 00:12:09,560
Thank you, auntie.

211
00:12:12,990 --> 00:12:14,330
Yummy.

212
00:12:14,560 --> 00:12:17,030
Auntie, you're so good at cooking!

213
00:12:17,030 --> 00:12:19,200
-Thank you.
-Don't be so exaggerated.

214
00:12:19,200 --> 00:12:21,300
He is being polite.

215
00:12:21,300 --> 00:12:22,500
Eat more.

216
00:12:22,500 --> 00:12:25,540
Don't let Shi De bully you.

217
00:12:25,540 --> 00:12:26,410
Mom.

218
00:12:26,410 --> 00:12:27,680
It's his first time here.

219
00:12:27,680 --> 00:12:28,680
And you're playing favorites.

220
00:12:28,680 --> 00:12:30,180
Who's your son?

221
00:12:30,180 --> 00:12:33,980
I can't help it, but Yi is so cute.

222
00:12:33,980 --> 00:12:35,120
Do you mind if I call you that?

223
00:12:35,120 --> 00:12:36,520
Of course not.

224
00:12:37,120 --> 00:12:38,550
Yi.

225
00:12:39,690 --> 00:12:41,320
Auntie has my permission, not you.

226
00:12:41,320 --> 00:12:42,490
I have his permission, not you.

227
00:12:44,530 --> 00:12:46,130
You guys enjoy.

228
00:12:46,130 --> 00:12:48,030
-What's up?
-What's up?

229
00:12:48,030 --> 00:12:49,260
So petty.

230
00:12:49,260 --> 00:12:51,300
-Only I can call him that.
-Yeah.

231
00:12:51,300 --> 00:12:55,340
Yi, you're super cute.

232
00:12:55,340 --> 00:12:55,940
Thank you.

233
00:12:55,940 --> 00:12:56,970
Okay.

234
00:12:56,970 --> 00:12:58,610
Here are your sweet and sour ribs.

235
00:12:58,610 --> 00:13:01,240
Don't say that I play favorites

236
00:13:01,240 --> 00:13:03,040
and stop eating as a silent protest.

237
00:13:03,040 --> 00:13:05,610
No, no. Yi should have more.

238
00:13:05,610 --> 00:13:06,650
So he will get bigger

239
00:13:06,650 --> 00:13:08,250
and won't get bullied.

240
00:13:08,250 --> 00:13:09,380
Why are you jealous?

241
00:13:09,380 --> 00:13:10,950
Or should I call you De?

242
00:13:12,150 --> 00:13:12,820
That's disgusting.

243
00:13:12,820 --> 00:13:13,450
De.

244
00:13:13,450 --> 00:13:15,020
Yeah, I used to call you De when you were a kid.

245
00:13:15,020 --> 00:13:16,020
You said

246
00:13:16,020 --> 00:13:17,460
you were a grown up

247
00:13:17,460 --> 00:13:19,030
and I had to stop calling you that.

248
00:13:19,030 --> 00:13:20,390
I didn't call you ma'am then.

249
00:13:21,860 --> 00:13:23,630
You little brat.

250
00:13:23,630 --> 00:13:24,870
I'm telling you, that's how he behaves.

251
00:13:24,870 --> 00:13:25,770
If he bullies you,

252
00:13:25,770 --> 00:13:26,300
let me know.

253
00:13:26,300 --> 00:13:27,330
I'll deal with him.

254
00:13:43,480 --> 00:13:44,590
You...

255
00:13:44,590 --> 00:13:46,350
You're washing the dishes like this?

256
00:13:47,020 --> 00:13:47,890
That's it?

257
00:13:47,890 --> 00:13:48,660
Yeah.

258
00:13:48,660 --> 00:13:50,620
No.

259
00:13:50,620 --> 00:13:52,160
Use the dishcloth.

260
00:13:54,030 --> 00:13:54,900
This one.

261
00:13:56,600 --> 00:13:57,430
So troublesome？

262
00:14:01,340 --> 00:14:03,200
Is it troublesome for you to take a shower?

263
00:14:07,070 --> 00:14:08,980
Is someone helping you with the bath?

264
00:14:08,980 --> 00:14:10,510
No way!

265
00:14:25,230 --> 00:14:26,460
Wait a minute.

266
00:14:26,460 --> 00:14:27,660
Alright.

267
00:14:27,660 --> 00:14:28,830
Alright!

268
00:14:29,400 --> 00:14:30,930
Am I wrong again?

269
00:14:32,970 --> 00:14:34,470
It's a bit too wet.

270
00:14:37,940 --> 00:14:38,540
Okay.

271
00:14:38,540 --> 00:14:39,740
Just leave it to me.

272
00:14:51,250 --> 00:14:52,520
Is it all done?

273
00:14:53,250 --> 00:14:54,490
Thank you.

274
00:14:54,490 --> 00:14:55,890
Put the fruits here, please.

275
00:14:55,890 --> 00:14:57,790
Yi, come and sit with me.

276
00:14:58,430 --> 00:14:59,390
What about me?

277
00:14:59,390 --> 00:15:01,160
Get your own chair.

278
00:15:02,930 --> 00:15:04,830
Sit down and have some fruits.

279
00:15:04,830 --> 00:15:07,600
Thank you for the work.

280
00:15:12,710 --> 00:15:13,540
Not bad.

281
00:15:17,580 --> 00:15:19,480
Why are you so nervous?

282
00:15:20,920 --> 00:15:21,650
Thank you.

283
00:15:23,450 --> 00:15:25,190
All right.

284
00:15:25,190 --> 00:15:26,750
Take it easy.

285
00:15:27,320 --> 00:15:28,720
You don't have to be nervous

286
00:15:28,720 --> 00:15:30,790
or do anything special to impress me.

287
00:15:30,790 --> 00:15:31,660
I didn't.

288
00:15:31,660 --> 00:15:33,490
I really wanted to help.

289
00:15:34,700 --> 00:15:36,160
Okay, mom.

290
00:15:36,160 --> 00:15:38,570
He won't do things he doesn't want to do.

291
00:15:38,570 --> 00:15:40,470
I know.

292
00:15:40,470 --> 00:15:43,140
But I'd like you to relax for a bit.

293
00:15:43,140 --> 00:15:44,870
You could act cute in front of me.

294
00:15:44,870 --> 00:15:47,110
He hasn't done that for a long time.

295
00:15:49,040 --> 00:15:50,640
I'm really happy.

296
00:15:51,180 --> 00:15:53,710
Shi De likes someone as cute as you.

297
00:15:53,710 --> 00:15:54,720
You're a good boy.

298
00:15:59,320 --> 00:16:00,620
You think I don't know?

299
00:16:00,620 --> 00:16:01,890
I'm your mother, okay?

300
00:16:02,560 --> 00:16:04,830
You've been following him everywhere
since elementary school.

301
00:16:04,830 --> 00:16:07,760
You even transferred to his college.

302
00:16:07,760 --> 00:16:09,200
All those paintings

303
00:16:09,200 --> 00:16:12,500
were about him, weren't they?

304
00:16:12,500 --> 00:16:14,700
I'll shut it, or he's gonna be pissed.

305
00:16:14,700 --> 00:16:15,840
So...

306
00:16:17,670 --> 00:16:19,770
Do you mind

307
00:16:20,510 --> 00:16:22,240
us...

308
00:16:22,240 --> 00:16:24,650
Of course I do.

309
00:16:31,550 --> 00:16:34,120
I want you to be truly happy

310
00:16:34,960 --> 00:16:37,090
and take good care of each other.

311
00:16:37,930 --> 00:16:40,160
How wonderful it is when you can be

312
00:16:40,160 --> 00:16:42,130
in a relationship with someone you like!

313
00:16:42,130 --> 00:16:44,060
If you feel satisfaction

314
00:16:44,060 --> 00:16:45,770
when you look at him,

315
00:16:45,770 --> 00:16:47,700
then you've found

316
00:16:49,240 --> 00:16:51,770
the right person.

317
00:16:55,640 --> 00:16:57,080
Thank you, auntie.

318
00:16:59,650 --> 00:17:01,320
You're so...

319
00:17:04,850 --> 00:17:06,120
So...?

320
00:17:07,420 --> 00:17:09,720
So modern and open-minded?

321
00:17:09,720 --> 00:17:11,530
So young and beautiful?

322
00:17:13,860 --> 00:17:16,060
Would you like to know how I take care of my skin?

323
00:17:16,060 --> 00:17:19,270
I've been doing yoga and drinking juice.

324
00:17:23,470 --> 00:17:25,010
You have a good mother.

325
00:17:26,070 --> 00:17:27,840
She will be yours one day.

326
00:17:28,810 --> 00:17:31,310
Or maybe right now?

327
00:17:31,310 --> 00:17:32,810
Come on.

328
00:17:33,550 --> 00:17:35,120
We're only together for less than a month.

329
00:17:35,820 --> 00:17:37,850
I've thought about this for years.

330
00:17:39,020 --> 00:17:40,950
Cut it out.

331
00:17:40,950 --> 00:17:42,490
I'm serious.

332
00:17:43,420 --> 00:17:44,460
I'll go first.

333
00:17:45,490 --> 00:17:46,790
Text me when you get home.

334
00:17:49,460 --> 00:17:50,160
Oh, by the way.

335
00:17:50,560 --> 00:17:52,570
My dad bought a cottage in Pingdong.

336
00:17:52,570 --> 00:17:54,030
Let's go there for a few days

337
00:17:54,030 --> 00:17:55,400
in July.

338
00:17:56,170 --> 00:17:56,870
Bye.

339
00:18:18,930 --> 00:18:19,690
Gao Shi De.

340
00:18:22,660 --> 00:18:24,160
Pei Shou Yi.

341
00:18:24,160 --> 00:18:26,300
Have you seen Gao Shi De?

342
00:18:34,010 --> 00:18:35,540
They're not here?

343
00:18:46,620 --> 00:18:48,460
Where are they?

344
00:18:49,090 --> 00:18:51,230
It's Dr. Pei's working hours, no?

345
00:18:52,730 --> 00:18:54,360
I haven't told him yet.

346
00:18:58,200 --> 00:18:59,570
I didn't expect

347
00:18:59,570 --> 00:19:01,740
he'd be a completely different person
after we dated.

348
00:19:02,370 --> 00:19:03,640
He helps my mom

349
00:19:03,640 --> 00:19:04,870
and worried about her feelings.

350
00:19:07,110 --> 00:19:08,480
You don't know

351
00:19:08,480 --> 00:19:10,610
how cute he is when he's serious.

352
00:19:10,610 --> 00:19:11,680
That's enough.

353
00:19:12,250 --> 00:19:13,850
No more showing off.

354
00:19:15,120 --> 00:19:16,320
Know your limits, OK?

355
00:19:20,190 --> 00:19:22,290
I was surprised when he invited me to the trip.

356
00:19:23,990 --> 00:19:26,090
He looked forward to it very much.

357
00:19:26,730 --> 00:19:27,760
I couldn't bear to tell him

358
00:19:27,760 --> 00:19:29,600
that I'm going to America after graduation.

359
00:19:29,600 --> 00:19:30,730
You're going to America?

360
00:19:34,670 --> 00:19:36,870
Why didn't you tell me you that?

361
00:19:36,870 --> 00:19:37,970
You're so...

362
00:19:38,510 --> 00:19:39,240
And...

363
00:19:40,940 --> 00:19:43,180
If it's gonna be a long-distance relationship,

364
00:19:43,180 --> 00:19:45,350
you have to ask if I'm OK with it.

365
00:19:45,350 --> 00:19:47,110
Do you have any respect for me?

366
00:19:47,110 --> 00:19:47,920
No.

367
00:19:47,920 --> 00:19:48,680
Listen to me.

368
00:19:49,680 --> 00:19:51,080
Shi De.

369
00:19:53,650 --> 00:19:54,990
Remember to bring me

370
00:19:55,860 --> 00:19:56,760
some cigarettes when you come back.

371
00:20:22,120 --> 00:20:23,380
So...

372
00:20:23,380 --> 00:20:25,690
why are you going to the United States?

373
00:20:25,690 --> 00:20:27,450
My mom's getting remarried.

374
00:20:27,450 --> 00:20:29,190
He's American.

375
00:20:29,190 --> 00:20:32,130
She'll live with him there afterwards.

376
00:20:32,130 --> 00:20:33,560
I'm going to her wedding

377
00:20:34,230 --> 00:20:37,630
and see how she's getting along with my step dad.

378
00:20:38,370 --> 00:20:40,530
I need to get to know him.

379
00:20:40,530 --> 00:20:41,770
After all,

380
00:20:41,770 --> 00:20:43,170
he's gonna be my family.

381
00:20:44,770 --> 00:20:45,810
Oh.

382
00:20:47,770 --> 00:20:49,440
You're my family, too.

383
00:20:52,110 --> 00:20:53,910
Any other questions?

384
00:20:53,910 --> 00:20:55,450
How long will it take?

385
00:20:56,180 --> 00:20:58,150
Maybe a few months.

386
00:21:02,790 --> 00:21:03,790
Can't live without me

387
00:21:03,790 --> 00:21:05,830
for a few months?

388
00:21:09,430 --> 00:21:12,470
Do you like me that much?

389
00:21:12,470 --> 00:21:14,000
Shut up.

390
00:21:14,500 --> 00:21:15,770
Come over tonight.

391
00:21:15,770 --> 00:21:16,740
No.

392
00:21:16,740 --> 00:21:18,870
My mom wants to know you better.

393
00:21:18,870 --> 00:21:20,140
You should say that first.

394
00:21:20,140 --> 00:21:21,510
What's your answer?

395
00:21:21,510 --> 00:21:22,680
OK.

396
00:21:39,460 --> 00:21:40,790
Oh, I see.

397
00:21:40,790 --> 00:21:43,130
Well, thank you for preparing for the contracts.

398
00:21:45,600 --> 00:21:46,700
Thank you.

399
00:21:51,940 --> 00:21:53,210
Have you made the reservation?

400
00:21:53,210 --> 00:21:56,340
I'm going to have dinner with Shu Yi.

401
00:21:56,340 --> 00:21:58,150
Remember to ask him to come.

402
00:21:58,150 --> 00:22:00,310
Master, Young Master is staying over
in his classmate's tonight.

403
00:22:04,750 --> 00:22:06,620
Why wasn't I informed?

404
00:22:06,620 --> 00:22:07,590
Young Master...

405
00:22:07,590 --> 00:22:10,090
seems to be in love recently.

406
00:22:10,090 --> 00:22:11,290
It's just...

407
00:22:12,190 --> 00:22:13,260
What?

408
00:22:15,300 --> 00:22:17,530
It's just what?

409
00:22:22,200 --> 00:22:23,040
Cheers.

410
00:22:29,140 --> 00:22:30,580
It's so cozy here.

411
00:22:33,780 --> 00:22:34,510
What are you doing?

412
00:22:41,890 --> 00:22:44,620
I saw this when I was shopping with my mom.

413
00:22:44,620 --> 00:22:46,190
I think it suits you well.

414
00:22:49,360 --> 00:22:51,370
Don't you ever take it off!

415
00:22:58,640 --> 00:23:00,410
Not even in the shower?

416
00:23:01,040 --> 00:23:01,880
Well...

417
00:23:04,080 --> 00:23:05,410
OK.

418
00:23:05,410 --> 00:23:06,610
That's an exception.

419
00:23:08,180 --> 00:23:10,180
But you can only wear what I gift you.

420
00:23:10,180 --> 00:23:11,350
Nothing else.

421
00:23:13,020 --> 00:23:13,920
Why?

422
00:23:16,860 --> 00:23:18,230
I didn't make it

423
00:23:18,930 --> 00:23:20,360
to be part of your past.

424
00:23:23,630 --> 00:23:25,000
But...

425
00:23:27,870 --> 00:23:29,970
I'll be the only one in the rest of your life.

426
00:23:34,980 --> 00:23:35,740
Answer me.

427
00:24:15,750 --> 00:24:17,280
I wish I could take you with me.

428
00:24:18,250 --> 00:24:20,450
Let me know if you need anything,

429
00:24:20,450 --> 00:24:21,390
I'll send it to you.

430
00:24:21,390 --> 00:24:23,560
Yi is so thoughtful.

431
00:24:23,560 --> 00:24:25,230
You should learn to be.

432
00:24:27,160 --> 00:24:28,630
He's only this sweet to you,

433
00:24:28,630 --> 00:24:30,660
but to the others...

434
00:24:30,660 --> 00:24:32,570
All right, we're leaving.

435
00:24:32,570 --> 00:24:35,670
I'll give him back to you as soon as I can.

436
00:24:35,670 --> 00:24:37,070
Auntie.

437
00:24:37,070 --> 00:24:38,470
Remember to miss me, okay?

438
00:24:38,470 --> 00:24:39,340
Good boy.

439
00:24:39,340 --> 00:24:40,740
Your turn.

440
00:24:46,410 --> 00:24:48,820
I don't know why my mom likes you so much.

441
00:24:48,820 --> 00:24:50,450
She treats you better than she does to me.

442
00:24:51,220 --> 00:24:52,520
Everybody loves me.

443
00:24:53,490 --> 00:24:54,220
Oh, yeah?

444
00:25:22,480 --> 00:25:23,620
Wait for me.

445
00:25:27,790 --> 00:25:28,490
Bye-Bye.

446
00:25:51,880 --> 00:25:54,610
(Though I hate e-mails,)

447
00:25:55,080 --> 00:25:58,690
(I've got a special account just for you.)

448
00:25:58,690 --> 00:26:00,290
(Let's see if you're smart enough)

449
00:26:00,290 --> 00:26:02,190
(to know the meaning behind it.)

450
00:26:08,060 --> 00:26:09,500
Stupid son.

451
00:26:09,500 --> 00:26:11,830
He called you stupid yet you are still smiling.

452
00:26:13,000 --> 00:26:14,770
Abruti means stupid

453
00:26:14,770 --> 00:26:16,840
in French.

454
00:26:18,740 --> 00:26:20,240
You're really sick.

455
00:26:20,240 --> 00:26:21,840
Why are you so happy?

456
00:26:21,840 --> 00:26:23,240
No, mom.

457
00:26:23,240 --> 00:26:26,950
In ASCII, 87887278

458
00:26:26,950 --> 00:26:28,650
can be translated into four letters in English.

459
00:26:28,650 --> 00:26:33,950
And WXHN in Pinyin

460
00:26:33,950 --> 00:26:36,990
means "I like you".

461
00:26:36,990 --> 00:26:39,090
Together with the word "Abruti",

462
00:26:39,090 --> 00:26:40,190
the e-mail address

463
00:26:40,190 --> 00:26:43,060
is "Stupid, I like you."

464
00:26:43,060 --> 00:26:45,630
Yi is so romantic.

465
00:26:45,630 --> 00:26:48,200
That's how educated young men date?

466
00:26:48,200 --> 00:26:49,940
Smart!

467
00:26:49,940 --> 00:26:50,970
No big deal.

468
00:26:50,970 --> 00:26:51,710
No big deal?

469
00:26:51,710 --> 00:26:52,640
You're my son.

470
00:26:52,640 --> 00:26:53,510
You're excellent.

471
00:26:53,510 --> 00:26:54,310
Excellent!

472
00:26:57,680 --> 00:27:00,750
If you like him, you should cherish him.

473
00:27:00,750 --> 00:27:02,420
Treat him well!

474
00:27:02,420 --> 00:27:03,620
Okay, mom.

475
00:27:03,620 --> 00:27:05,390
He's got my back.

476
00:27:05,390 --> 00:27:06,790
What about me?

477
00:27:06,790 --> 00:27:08,520
Just take care of yourself.

478
00:27:08,520 --> 00:27:09,960
Sir, the plane is about to take off.

479
00:27:09,960 --> 00:27:11,220
Put your phone away, please.

480
00:27:11,220 --> 00:27:12,630
Sorry.

481
00:27:16,630 --> 00:27:18,630
All right, don't be wordy.

482
00:27:20,200 --> 00:27:21,500
Why do you keep peeking?

483
00:27:30,740 --> 00:27:32,650
(Stupid Shi De)
(I like you, too.)

484
00:28:04,980 --> 00:28:06,650
(Love makes you)

485
00:28:06,650 --> 00:28:09,450
(stupid.)

486
00:28:09,450 --> 00:28:12,050
(Let's laugh together,)

487
00:28:12,050 --> 00:28:14,342
(miss each other together, and be stupid together)

488
00:28:14,342 --> 00:28:15,820
=Lesson 6=
(Hey, I Like You)

489
00:28:20,560 --> 00:28:22,930
(Gao Shi De, you're so busy, aren't you?)

490
00:28:23,660 --> 00:28:27,670
(No matter when I text you,
you never reply me immediately.)

491
00:28:28,070 --> 00:28:30,500
(You don't cherish me once you get me, right?)

492
00:28:37,360 --> 00:28:38,460
(You're so slow.)

493
00:28:47,620 --> 00:28:49,760
(Seriously, Gao Shi De,)

494
00:28:49,760 --> 00:28:51,760
(I kind of miss you.)

495
00:28:52,530 --> 00:28:54,460
(It's been a year and you're still not back yet.)

496
00:28:54,590 --> 00:28:56,160
(What's wrong with you exactly?)

497
00:29:00,670 --> 00:29:03,125
(How could you do this? )

498
00:29:03,125 --> 00:29:05,427
(Not even a word to me in a week.)

499
00:29:05,427 --> 00:29:07,996
(Are you mad at me
because I didn't reply after reading your texts?)

500
00:29:08,610 --> 00:29:10,198
(You can be occupied)

501
00:29:10,198 --> 00:29:12,950
(but can't I be too busy to get back to you?)

502
00:29:14,150 --> 00:29:17,780
(Anyway, I'm going abroad next week
to talk business for my dad.)

503
00:29:18,320 --> 00:29:20,390
(Don't miss me if you dare)

504
00:29:21,020 --> 00:29:23,660
(because I'll ignore you with my phone off.)

505
00:29:37,040 --> 00:29:38,810
Hi, baby.

506
00:29:39,640 --> 00:29:41,840
-You want some cake?
-Sure.

507
00:29:44,280 --> 00:29:45,380
Have a try.

508
00:29:46,610 --> 00:29:47,380
Is it good?

509
00:29:48,980 --> 00:29:49,780
Try it.

510
00:29:52,820 --> 00:29:53,550
Nice.

511
00:29:58,390 --> 00:30:01,316
Oscar. Do you want any juice?

512
00:30:01,316 --> 00:30:03,030
No, thanks.

513
00:30:03,030 --> 00:30:04,030
Oscar.

514
00:30:04,360 --> 00:30:06,200
Maybe any place you wanna go?

515
00:30:07,470 --> 00:30:08,700
Well, I just wanna stay here.

516
00:30:09,040 --> 00:30:10,025
Play with Oscar.

517
00:30:10,025 --> 00:30:10,458
OK.

518
00:30:11,740 --> 00:30:14,670
(Oh, I see. You're enjoying the sun in America)

519

(From today onward,)

523
00:31:27,369 --> 00:31:28,550
(there's no need for us to see each other again.)

524
00:31:29,880 --> 00:31:31,520

(Abruti,)

526
00:31:59,634 --> 00:32:01,550
(I'll just leave this word to you fool.)

527
00:32:03,550 --> 00:32:04,220
(I can be great)

528
00:32:05,250 --> 00:32:06,390
(even without you.)

529
00:32:39,890 --> 00:32:43,320
(Five years later)

530
00:32:43,378 --> 00:32:45,320
(Hua Cing Technology)

531
00:32:49,730 --> 00:32:51,330
Excuse me, do you have an appointment?

532
00:32:51,330 --> 00:32:52,430
