=No. 1 For You Special Edition=

13
00:00:57,690 --> 00:00:58,620
Gao Shi De.

14
00:00:58,890 --> 00:01:00,060
Let's finish this first.

15
00:01:09,760 --> 00:01:11,230
Sorry, I overheard it.

16
00:01:16,340 --> 00:01:17,770
That's why

17
00:01:20,010 --> 00:01:21,140
you tried to avoid me?

18
00:01:25,910 --> 00:01:27,280
You want a girlfriend,

19
00:01:27,980 --> 00:01:28,680
right?

20
00:01:29,720 --> 00:01:30,590
I...

21
00:01:36,790 --> 00:01:38,730
I don't want to fall for a man.

22
00:01:49,970 --> 00:01:51,110
Got it.

23
00:02:02,850 --> 00:02:04,120
But you don't have to find a girlfriend

24
00:02:04,120 --> 00:02:05,620
because of this.

25
00:02:06,650 --> 00:02:07,760
It's not fair to the girl.

26
00:02:10,060 --> 00:02:11,360
I'm not that odious.

27
00:02:12,660 --> 00:02:13,360
Okay, then.

28
00:02:46,760 --> 00:02:48,430
Find a girl you like

29
00:02:49,200 --> 00:02:50,670
and be nice to her.

30
00:02:58,140 --> 00:02:59,470
The best way to comfort a broken heart

31
00:02:59,470 --> 00:03:01,280
is to fall in love again.

32
00:03:08,580 --> 00:03:09,780
Wish you happy.

33
00:03:11,850 --> 00:03:13,090
Gao Shi De.

34
00:03:13,220 --> 00:03:14,190
See if you can stand up.

35
00:03:20,960 --> 00:03:21,800
Much better.

36
00:03:24,600 --> 00:03:25,270
Thank you.

37
00:03:31,170 --> 00:03:32,140
Zhou Shu Yi.

38
00:03:38,910 --> 00:03:40,550
Yes, I like you.

39
00:03:45,150 --> 00:03:46,390
But it's none of your business.

40
00:03:51,390 --> 00:03:52,930
Forget what I said the other day.

41
00:04:25,290 --> 00:04:26,760
Still alive?

42
00:04:26,960 --> 00:04:29,760
I thought my son was Le Penseur.

43
00:04:31,770 --> 00:04:33,470
What's the matter? Something's bothering you?

44
00:04:34,640 --> 00:04:35,400
Nothing.

45
00:04:35,640 --> 00:04:37,110
Nothing?

46
00:04:37,310 --> 00:04:39,170
You're my son.

47
00:04:39,170 --> 00:04:40,940
I know you too well.

48
00:04:40,940 --> 00:04:41,910
Don't bother to lie to me.

49
00:04:43,040 --> 00:04:43,810
What's the matter?

50
00:04:43,810 --> 00:04:44,610
Just tell me.

51
00:04:51,020 --> 00:04:52,550
I was just thinking...

52
00:04:54,820 --> 00:04:56,360
how I can give up someone I like?

53
00:04:59,730 --> 00:05:01,360
Have you tried to pursue that person?

54
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:07,740
Why would you give up without even trying?

55
00:05:08,170 --> 00:05:10,140
I thought you had guts.

56
00:05:10,140 --> 00:05:12,040
I remembered you used to be pretty brave.

57
00:05:12,040 --> 00:05:12,970
Did you lost it?

58
00:05:12,970 --> 00:05:14,510
Would you like me to help you find it?

59
00:05:15,740 --> 00:05:16,680
Mom.

60
00:05:18,310 --> 00:05:19,810
If you like someone,

61
00:05:20,080 --> 00:05:21,380
try as much as you can

62
00:05:21,580 --> 00:05:23,250
if nothing stops you from doing it.

63
00:05:23,990 --> 00:05:25,320
If you don't even try,

64
00:05:25,320 --> 00:05:27,120
you won't know how things will turn out.

65
00:05:27,120 --> 00:05:28,790
Without trying,

66
00:05:29,320 --> 00:05:30,990
you must regret it later.

67
00:05:33,430 --> 00:05:34,760
What if

68
00:05:36,030 --> 00:05:38,030
I know I'd fail.

69
00:05:39,070 --> 00:05:40,470
Should I still try?

70
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:43,810
Son.

71
00:05:43,940 --> 00:05:45,770
What's wrong with you?

72
00:05:45,770 --> 00:05:47,110
My handsome boy!

73
00:05:48,310 --> 00:05:50,180
Have some confidence, come on!

74
00:05:51,550 --> 00:05:53,350
You're not him.

75
00:05:53,350 --> 00:05:55,420
How do you know what he'll say to you?

76
00:05:55,980 --> 00:05:57,690
You should definitely try.

77
00:05:57,690 --> 00:05:59,620
Even if it doesn't work out,

78
00:05:59,620 --> 00:06:00,790
so what?

79
00:06:02,090 --> 00:06:04,960
Setbacks will only make a man more attractive.

80
00:06:07,200 --> 00:06:08,100
But you still have to

81
00:06:08,100 --> 00:06:09,460
go to America with me.

82
00:06:09,460 --> 00:06:10,530
If you choose your lover

83
00:06:10,530 --> 00:06:11,630
over your mother,

84
00:06:11,630 --> 00:06:13,100
you're too ungrateful.

85
00:06:13,100 --> 00:06:14,400
I won't, Mom.

86
00:06:14,400 --> 00:06:15,940
I'll keep my words.

87
00:06:16,440 --> 00:06:17,540
That's good.

88
00:06:17,810 --> 00:06:18,670
Let's eat.

89
00:06:18,670 --> 00:06:20,580
I rarely cook.

90
00:06:20,810 --> 00:06:22,780
Yeah. You rarely cook.

91
00:06:23,910 --> 00:06:25,950
No work, then.

92
00:06:26,410 --> 00:06:27,980
Enjoy your dinner with your son.

93
00:06:29,650 --> 00:06:31,420
Yes, baby boy.

94
00:06:31,950 --> 00:06:32,790
Let's eat.

95
00:06:35,320 --> 00:06:37,630
This is your favorite.

96
00:06:40,900 --> 00:06:42,960
Eat more and think less.

97
00:06:42,960 --> 00:06:44,070
OK.

98
00:07:21,800 --> 00:07:23,270
There you are!

99
00:07:27,240 --> 00:07:28,780
It smells like talcum powder.

100
00:07:28,780 --> 00:07:29,940
Is the shrimp ready?

101
00:07:30,810 --> 00:07:32,250
Yes.

102
00:07:35,280 --> 00:07:36,820
So cool.

103
00:07:37,420 --> 00:07:38,890
I thought...

104
00:07:39,390 --> 00:07:40,860
you were asking me on a date.

105
00:07:40,860 --> 00:07:41,720
I'll take you to the infirmary.

106
00:07:41,720 --> 00:07:42,820
No, thanks.

107
00:07:44,430 --> 00:07:45,630
Should I carry you on my back or in my arms?

108
00:07:45,630 --> 00:07:46,630
Choose one.

109
00:07:47,200 --> 00:07:48,930
Zhou Shu Yi.

110
00:07:49,560 --> 00:07:51,270
I like you.

111
00:07:52,700 --> 00:07:54,770
None of my business?

112
00:07:55,100 --> 00:07:56,200
You like me.

113
00:07:56,200 --> 00:07:57,710
Of course it's my business.

114
00:08:15,060 --> 00:08:16,920
(Damn idiot)
The deal's off.

115
00:08:16,920 --> 00:08:18,460
I'll delete the video.

116
00:08:18,460 --> 00:08:20,660
Thank you for being my friend these days.

117
00:08:20,660 --> 00:08:22,230
These days?

118
00:08:22,230 --> 00:08:24,430
Did I say I was done with you?

119
00:08:24,730 --> 00:08:26,430
Fine, don't be friends anymore.

120
00:08:26,430 --> 00:08:27,640
Who cares!

121
00:08:47,690 --> 00:08:49,320
You are crazy about spicy pot, right?

122
00:08:49,320 --> 00:08:49,990
Tell you what,

123
00:08:49,990 --> 00:08:51,930
I went to a really great restaurant serving that last week.

124
00:08:51,930 --> 00:08:52,960
Shall we go together?

125
00:08:52,960 --> 00:08:54,330
Invite Gao Shi De to join us.

126
00:08:54,630 --> 00:08:56,300
I won't eat with him.

127
00:08:56,660 --> 00:08:57,870
Shi De.

128
00:08:57,870 --> 00:08:59,730
It's been a long time since we
went out together last time.

129
00:09:00,170 --> 00:09:02,370
Oh, you two had a fight?

130
00:09:02,370 --> 00:09:04,210
That's why I haven't seen you together lately.

131
00:09:04,210 --> 00:09:05,870
No.

132
00:09:06,810 --> 00:09:07,880
It's Gao Shi De.

133
00:09:08,710 --> 00:09:09,480
What's the matter?

134
00:09:15,720 --> 00:09:16,850
I forgot my phone.

135
00:09:19,950 --> 00:09:20,690
Shu Yi.

136
00:09:20,690 --> 00:09:22,360
The classroom is over there. Where are you going?

137
00:09:29,560 --> 00:09:30,430
Hi!

138
00:09:31,930 --> 00:09:33,370
Do you know what's wrong with them?

139
00:09:41,040 --> 00:09:42,010
Mind your own business!

140
00:09:45,510 --> 00:09:46,680
Coward.

141
00:09:52,750 --> 00:09:55,490
What's he always this angry lately?

142
00:09:58,260 --> 00:10:00,230
If it hurts, find something to bite on.

143
00:10:00,230 --> 00:10:02,760
Doc, there's no such thing here.

144
00:10:03,830 --> 00:10:05,030
It's done.

145
00:10:07,500 --> 00:10:09,140
If you drive fast again,

146
00:10:09,500 --> 00:10:11,370
I'll break your bones

147
00:10:11,370 --> 00:10:12,810
before putting plaster on it,

148
00:10:13,310 --> 00:10:16,440
so you'll know the importance of
taking care of your body

149
00:10:17,380 --> 00:10:18,710
and won't hurt yourself again.

150
00:10:19,280 --> 00:10:20,880
It's not that we won't.

151
00:10:21,520 --> 00:10:22,850
We simply don't dare to.

152
00:10:26,650 --> 00:10:27,660
Get out!

153
00:10:28,190 --> 00:10:29,460
Thank you, school doctor.

154
00:10:48,840 --> 00:10:50,040
Pei Shou Yi.

155
00:10:59,190 --> 00:11:00,550
Miss me?

156
00:11:09,100 --> 00:11:10,600
Pei Shou Yi!

157
00:11:18,610 --> 00:11:19,640
What's the matter?

158
00:11:21,810 --> 00:11:23,240
Nothing.

159
00:11:23,640 --> 00:11:25,210
You standing by the door

160
00:11:25,510 --> 00:11:28,150
reminded me of a troublesome kid

161
00:11:28,550 --> 00:11:30,020
when I was a high school doctor.

162
00:11:34,660 --> 00:11:36,320
You're done with Mr. Zhou?

163
00:11:36,320 --> 00:11:37,560
Yeah.

164
00:11:37,790 --> 00:11:38,730
Right.

165
00:11:39,190 --> 00:11:40,560
Why did you mess with us?

166
00:11:45,770 --> 00:11:47,800
You ate my instant noodles without asking.

167
00:11:48,240 --> 00:11:49,900
Just a bowl of instant noodles.

168
00:11:49,900 --> 00:11:51,210
Seriously?

169
00:11:55,280 --> 00:11:57,210
You can eat anything you want,

170
00:11:57,580 --> 00:11:59,450
but not that bag of instant noodles.

171
00:11:59,450 --> 00:12:00,350
That's mine!

172
00:12:04,120 --> 00:12:05,590
If it weren't for you,

173
00:12:06,050 --> 00:12:07,190
we could have been friends

174
00:12:07,190 --> 00:12:08,460
until we graduate.

175

You can't hide your feelings.

You have affective disorder,
don't talk about feelings with me.

Do you think it's true?

212
00:14:48,550 --> 00:14:49,050
Hey!

213
00:14:50,320 --> 00:14:50,990
Hey!

214
00:14:53,450 --> 00:14:55,190
Don't pretend to be strong!

215
00:14:55,320 --> 00:14:56,060
What?

216
00:14:56,560 --> 00:14:57,260
Gao Shi De!

217
00:14:57,630 --> 00:14:57,990
Hey!

218
00:14:58,290 --> 00:14:59,060
Why are you hiding from me?

219
00:15:00,330 --> 00:15:01,000
What are you doing?

220
00:15:01,460 --> 00:15:02,500
Sorry, man.

221
00:15:02,860 --> 00:15:03,760
He thought you were someone else.

222
00:15:05,330 --> 00:15:06,800
What are you doing?

223
00:15:10,300 --> 00:15:11,340
I'm doomed.

224
00:15:11,670 --> 00:15:12,410
What?

225
00:15:13,740 --> 00:15:15,280
I think I've fallen for him.

226
00:15:28,220 --> 00:15:29,520
You asked me to come here

227
00:15:29,520 --> 00:15:31,160
just to ask me this?

228
00:15:31,160 --> 00:15:32,560
Answer me.

229
00:15:32,560 --> 00:15:33,960
Do you like Zhou Shu Yi?

230
00:15:36,500 --> 00:15:37,330
It's none of your business.

231
00:15:38,200 --> 00:15:39,400
Wait!

232
00:15:39,730 --> 00:15:40,900
Hear me out.

233
00:15:40,900 --> 00:15:41,770
Okay?

234
00:15:54,520 --> 00:15:56,650
You know I've liked you for so long.

235
00:15:56,650 --> 00:15:58,590
Do you think it's fun seeing me follow you around?

236
00:16:00,290 --> 00:16:01,460
Shi Zhe Yu.

237
00:16:01,460 --> 00:16:04,060
Don't impose your feelings on others.

238
00:16:05,160 --> 00:16:07,090
It is not that you will get anything in return

239
00:16:07,090 --> 00:16:08,560
for your efforts when it comes to love.

240
00:16:10,600 --> 00:16:12,170
Then why didn't you tell me earlier?

241
00:16:18,810 --> 00:16:20,410
If I made you

242
00:16:20,410 --> 00:16:21,540
misunderstand before,

243
00:16:23,580 --> 00:16:24,980
I sincerely apologize for that.

244
00:16:30,350 --> 00:16:31,850
Gao Shi De, you bastard!

245
00:16:32,150 --> 00:16:33,620
How could you do this to me?

246
00:16:33,620 --> 00:16:34,820
Even you're bullying me!

247
00:16:39,360 --> 00:16:40,490
What are you doing?

248
00:16:40,490 --> 00:16:41,960
You've scolded him for long,

249
00:16:42,530 --> 00:16:43,330
you must be thirsty.

250
00:16:43,900 --> 00:16:45,530
Go away!

251
00:16:45,770 --> 00:16:47,570
I won't accept you.

252
00:16:50,100 --> 00:16:51,110
What?

253
00:16:52,710 --> 00:16:53,640
Still pretending?

254
00:16:55,110 --> 00:16:56,680
Every time I teased Zhou Shu Yi,

255
00:16:56,680 --> 00:16:58,110
you came and interrupted us.

256
00:16:58,750 --> 00:17:00,950
I know what's on your mind!

257
00:17:01,580 --> 00:17:02,850
You are not my cup of tea!

258
00:17:03,850 --> 00:17:05,090
Of course not.

259
00:17:11,890 --> 00:17:13,390
I don't like you.

260
00:17:13,630 --> 00:17:14,960
I did it for Zhou Shu Yi.

261
00:17:14,960 --> 00:17:16,130
Zhou Shu Yi!

262
00:17:16,130 --> 00:17:17,330
Again?

263
00:17:24,270 --> 00:17:25,410
Am I that bad?

264
00:17:25,670 --> 00:17:27,040
Why don't you like me even?

265
00:17:27,040 --> 00:17:27,920
You're nothing near bad.

266
00:17:27,920 --> 00:17:29,560
-It's just...
-If that's so,

267
00:17:29,560 --> 00:17:31,400
How could you not like me?

268
00:17:31,950 --> 00:17:35,560
-Say something! Say it!
-Hey! Control yourself.

269
00:17:35,560 --> 00:17:36,950
Tell me!

270
00:17:36,950 --> 00:17:38,360
Say it!

271
00:17:38,360 --> 00:17:40,760
Am I that annoying so no one likes me?

272
00:17:40,760 --> 00:17:41,440
Stop it!

273
00:17:42,790 --> 00:17:43,920
What aspect about me is bad on earth?

274
00:17:50,130 --> 00:17:51,570
I just don't like you.

275
00:17:55,240 --> 00:17:56,200
Are you done?

276
00:18:02,610 --> 00:18:04,950
You can't force people to like you.

277
00:18:11,020 --> 00:18:12,720
You can cry if you want.

278
00:18:12,720 --> 00:18:14,190
Bullshit!

279
00:18:17,420 --> 00:18:18,830
Smile, then.

280
00:18:23,960 --> 00:18:25,200
Or...

281
00:18:26,130 --> 00:18:28,540
let me buy you dinner.

282
00:18:31,170 --> 00:18:33,170
Good food is for the lovelorn, right?

283
00:18:33,170 --> 00:18:34,740
I'm not lovelorn!

284
00:18:40,410 --> 00:18:42,050
Then let's celebrate the birthday.

285
00:18:44,420 --> 00:18:45,720
It's your birthday today?

286
00:18:50,060 --> 00:18:51,390
Yesterday, yeah.

287
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:05,440
If you miss him, go find him.

288
00:19:06,770 --> 00:19:08,710
You think I haven't tried?

289
00:19:10,740 --> 00:19:12,480
Then why don't you just ask him out?

290
00:19:13,310 --> 00:19:13,910
Why should I?

291
00:19:15,050 --> 00:19:17,650
He'll know I'm looking for him.

292
00:19:18,020 --> 00:19:18,850
It's so embarrassing.

293
00:19:19,850 --> 00:19:21,090
Kiddo.

294
00:19:21,790 --> 00:19:23,190
You've been running around school lately

295
00:19:23,190 --> 00:19:24,790
just to meet him, right?

296
00:19:26,130 --> 00:19:26,960
So what?

297
00:19:29,100 --> 00:19:31,300
I thought it wasn't so hard to find
someone in the information era.

298
00:19:31,870 --> 00:19:32,970
Now I know

299
00:19:32,970 --> 00:19:35,570
you can never find whoever tries to avoid you.

300
00:19:37,100 --> 00:19:38,940
How did he find me before?

301
00:19:39,340 --> 00:19:41,180
We're from different departments,

302
00:19:41,180 --> 00:19:42,880
but I met him every day.

303
00:19:45,580 --> 00:19:47,410
It occurs to me

304
00:19:47,410 --> 00:19:50,180
he's been there in your whole life.

305
00:19:53,020 --> 00:19:55,520
Do you remember when we played hide and seek?

306
00:19:56,020 --> 00:19:57,290
As long as he was the ghost,

307
00:19:57,290 --> 00:19:59,060
you were always the first to get caught.

308
00:20:01,130 --> 00:20:02,330
Sounds like it.

309
00:20:06,600 --> 00:20:08,740
Because he's been watching you.

310
00:20:10,440 --> 00:20:12,340
What a stalker!

311
00:20:12,570 --> 00:20:13,440
So creepy.

312
00:20:19,950 --> 00:20:21,950
Zheng Wen told me

313
00:20:21,950 --> 00:20:24,720
you had a crush on me, right?

314
00:20:26,020 --> 00:20:27,150
It's over.

315
00:20:29,120 --> 00:20:31,120
But you didn't notice

316
00:20:31,490 --> 00:20:33,190
that Gao Shi De has always been the one

317
00:20:33,190 --> 00:20:34,060
by your side.

318
00:20:36,930 --> 00:20:37,730
Shu Yi.

319
00:20:38,800 --> 00:20:40,500
You've fallen for him, right?

320
00:20:46,340 --> 00:20:47,980
Do what you have to do.

321
00:20:49,180 --> 00:20:50,040
You can make it!

322
00:21:09,300 --> 00:21:11,600
(What are you doing, Gao Shi De?)

323
00:21:11,800 --> 00:21:13,500
(I can't find you anywhere.)

324
00:21:18,510 --> 00:21:19,470
Gao Shi De!

325
00:21:20,570 --> 00:21:21,980
You are avoiding me!

326
00:21:22,480 --> 00:21:24,380
You're tired of the game?

327
00:21:27,710 --> 00:21:29,020
I deleted the video.

328
00:21:29,020 --> 00:21:30,150
You can check my phone...

329
00:21:31,650 --> 00:21:33,490
You threatened me to be your page boy

330
00:21:33,820 --> 00:21:35,320
with the video

331
00:21:35,790 --> 00:21:37,320
because you were worried about me.

332
00:21:41,060 --> 00:21:43,430
You said I could be free if I beat you once

333
00:21:44,770 --> 00:21:46,470
just to distract me.

334
00:21:46,470 --> 00:21:48,140
I'm not that good.

335
00:21:49,140 --> 00:21:50,770
I did it partly for myself, too.

336
00:21:52,910 --> 00:21:54,470
I wanted us to be closer

337
00:21:55,080 --> 00:21:56,980
and be friends till graduation.

338
00:21:56,980 --> 00:21:59,150
Aren't you going to tell him?

339
00:22:08,320 --> 00:22:10,390
We've just become friends.

340
00:22:10,390 --> 00:22:12,060
I don't want to lose him so soon.

341
00:22:12,930 --> 00:22:14,290
Are you stupid?

342
00:22:14,290 --> 00:22:15,460
Being friends is enough?

343
00:22:15,460 --> 00:22:17,360
You did the same to Jiang Yu Xin
and Fang Zheng Wen.

344
00:22:23,400 --> 00:22:24,570
Well, I gotta go.

345
00:22:26,840 --> 00:22:28,380
Am I still the lucky one?

346
00:22:34,820 --> 00:22:36,820
That day at the infirmary,

347
00:22:36,820 --> 00:22:38,690
I said the one you liked was a lucky guy.

348
00:22:39,820 --> 00:22:41,760
When I was asleep, you said

349
00:22:41,760 --> 00:22:43,820
the lucky one had always been me.

350
00:22:46,460 --> 00:22:48,200
Is it still me?

351
00:22:50,100 --> 00:22:51,200
Say it!

352
00:22:51,870 --> 00:22:52,830
Is it still me?

353
00:22:54,470 --> 00:22:55,870
It doesn't matter now.

354
00:22:57,770 --> 00:22:59,440
I'm being serious, Gao Shi De.

355
00:22:59,440 --> 00:23:00,770
Stop it!

356
00:23:17,860 --> 00:23:18,860
Zhou Shu Yi.

357
00:23:19,890 --> 00:23:21,060
Stop it, or I'll get mad.

358
00:23:21,060 --> 00:23:23,130
I'm the one who should be mad!

359
00:23:23,130 --> 00:23:24,970
So am I still the lucky guy or not?

360
00:23:24,970 --> 00:23:26,630
Or were you just kidding that day?

361
00:23:26,630 --> 00:23:28,240
What the hell are you trying to do?

362
00:23:28,240 --> 00:23:29,840
I like you!

363
00:23:40,150 --> 00:23:42,050
What about Jiang Yu Xin then?

364
00:23:42,050 --> 00:23:43,550
I thought you said you didn't like boys.

365
00:23:43,550 --> 00:23:44,720
Because it's you.

366
00:23:45,920 --> 00:23:47,250
I have no choice.

367
00:23:53,830 --> 00:23:55,330
You don't believe me?

368
00:23:55,900 --> 00:23:56,560
OK.

369
00:23:57,700 --> 00:23:59,170
What are you doing?

370
00:23:59,830 --> 00:24:00,900
You don't believe me.

371
00:24:00,900 --> 00:24:02,470
I'll prove it to you.

372
00:24:02,470 --> 00:24:04,370
Will you believe me if I throw it away?

373
00:24:05,040 --> 00:24:07,040
It doesn't mean anything.

374
00:24:11,280 --> 00:24:12,280
