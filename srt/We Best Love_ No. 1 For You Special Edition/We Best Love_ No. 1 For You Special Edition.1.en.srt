Damn Gao Shi De!

133
00:07:25,580 --> 00:07:27,110
It's his fault.

134
00:07:29,610 --> 00:07:31,410
Why didn't you tell me he would come?

135
00:07:34,920 --> 00:07:36,020
I'm sorry.

136
00:07:36,020 --> 00:07:38,250
I thought the new member

just had the same name as his.

138
00:07:41,320 --> 00:07:42,590
But it turned out to be him.

139
00:07:42,830 --> 00:07:43,790
I'm sorry.

140
00:07:43,790 --> 00:07:44,630
Forget it.

141

You've known each other for so long.

You're good friends.

143

I'm not his friend.

Absurd!

145
00:07:52,170 --> 00:07:54,300
We were in the same school since primary school,

146
00:07:54,800 --> 00:07:56,840
I didn't expect to meet him in this university.

147
00:07:57,510 --> 00:07:59,040
But he transferred to
the Department of Computer Science

148
00:07:59,040 --> 00:08:02,310
in his sophomore year!

149
00:08:02,850 --> 00:08:04,410
I've been tolerating for long.

150
00:08:05,050 --> 00:08:07,180
I'll never forgive him!

151
00:08:08,690 --> 00:08:09,590
What did he say?

152
00:08:10,150 --> 00:08:11,620
He said he wanted to screw Shi De.

153
00:08:12,490 --> 00:08:13,690
Yeah!

154
00:08:13,690 --> 00:08:15,530
I'll stand by you no matter what!

155
00:08:15,890 --> 00:08:17,230
Let's show Gao Shi De what we've got.

156
00:08:24,770 --> 00:08:25,870
What's the matter?

157
00:08:30,570 --> 00:08:32,110
Bing Wei, is it done?

158
00:08:32,110 --> 00:08:33,510
Wait a minute. Almost done.

159
00:08:33,510 --> 00:08:34,640
They're coming. Come on.

160
00:08:36,050 --> 00:08:37,210
Come on.

00:08:37,550 --> 00:08:38,750
All right.

00:08:51,930 --> 00:08:53,330
May I use it first.

165
00:08:54,260 --> 00:08:55,400
OK.

166
00:08:55,400 --> 00:08:56,430
Thank you.

167
00:09:02,840 --> 00:09:03,770
Who did this?

168
00:09:05,510 --> 00:09:06,910
Who is so boring?

169
00:09:07,480 --> 00:09:08,550
Damn it.

Who did this?

173
00:09:25,460 --> 00:09:26,360
Good shot!

174
00:09:26,360 --> 00:09:27,130
Shi De.

175
00:09:28,630 --> 00:09:30,100
That lay-up was a good one.

176
00:09:30,100 --> 00:09:31,230
Good one! Nice capping.

177
00:09:34,540 --> 00:09:35,270
Please drink this.

178
00:09:38,270 --> 00:09:39,610
Free drinks.

179
00:09:39,610 --> 00:09:40,680
Why waste it?

180
00:09:43,110 --> 00:09:44,280
It's a bomb.

181
00:09:45,950 --> 00:09:47,680
You idiot. Why do you give it to me?

182
00:09:47,950 --> 00:09:49,490
It's my new clothes.

183
00:09:57,480 --> 00:09:58,410
(Stupid)

184
00:10:05,040 --> 00:10:06,270
Towel.

185
00:10:09,840 --> 00:10:11,270
I'm in bad luck recently.

186
00:10:55,890 --> 00:10:57,450
-Hi.
-Hi.

187
00:11:25,050 --> 00:11:26,050
That's very nice.

188
00:11:26,480 --> 00:11:27,250
Continue.

189
00:11:27,580 --> 00:11:28,220
I want...

190
00:11:28,220 --> 00:11:29,820
Do I have to play because you want to hear it?

191
00:11:30,190 --> 00:11:31,190
Who do you think you are?

192
00:11:33,290 --> 00:11:34,990
I mean

193
00:11:35,830 --> 00:11:36,730
it's great.

194
00:11:38,190 --> 00:11:39,030
Bravo.

195
00:11:51,370 --> 00:11:54,340
It was you who pulled the pranks before, right?

196
00:11:54,340 --> 00:11:55,310
What pranks?

197
00:11:55,310 --> 00:11:56,580
I don't know.

198
00:12:01,720 --> 00:12:02,420
What are you doing?

199
00:12:07,290 --> 00:12:08,660
Smell like talcum powder.

200
00:12:09,760 --> 00:12:10,560
Stop lying.

201
00:12:10,560 --> 00:12:11,330
I've thrown...

202
00:12:11,330 --> 00:12:12,530
What?

203
00:12:32,880 --> 00:12:35,220
Sprinkle chili powder on his swimming trunk.

204
00:12:38,220 --> 00:12:40,920
Call him and remain silent.

205
00:12:43,390 --> 00:12:45,500
Use wax to remove his eyebrows.

206
00:12:47,930 --> 00:12:49,570
Cut his nose hair secretly.

207
00:12:52,070 --> 00:12:54,500
Put gum on his chair.

208
00:12:57,010 --> 00:12:59,010
(A million pranks to be pulled on Gao Shi De)

209
00:12:59,010 --> 00:13:00,010
Is that enough?

210
00:13:00,010 --> 00:13:01,580
From three o'clock till now, seriously?

211
00:13:01,580 --> 00:13:03,050
Yeah, I'm running out of inspiration.

212
00:13:03,480 --> 00:13:05,020
Are you punishing him or us?

213
00:13:08,020 --> 00:13:10,120
Let's just find some hooligans to beat him up.

214
00:13:11,590 --> 00:13:12,790
Are you stupid?

215
00:13:12,790 --> 00:13:13,890
You study law.

216
00:13:13,890 --> 00:13:15,160
How can you come up with this crap?

217
00:13:15,160 --> 00:13:16,230
They are quite good at it.

218
00:13:16,230 --> 00:13:17,490
He won't find out.

219
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:21,430
Well.

220
00:13:21,430 --> 00:13:22,230
Just forget it.

221
00:13:22,770 --> 00:13:23,930
We're about to graduate.

222
00:13:24,470 --> 00:13:25,570
Just bear with it for a while longer.

223
00:13:26,240 --> 00:13:29,340
That's why I want a memorial.

224
00:13:30,510 --> 00:13:31,910
Do you remember when we were in Grade Six?

225
00:13:32,440 --> 00:13:33,880
You also said you wanted to do it.

226
00:13:34,410 --> 00:13:35,810
But you ended up falling into
the tree hole instead.

227
00:13:36,150 --> 00:13:37,410
And he saved you.

228
00:13:38,080 --> 00:13:40,120
Every time when you were about to graduate,

229
00:13:41,050 --> 00:13:43,390
you wanted to punish him.

230
00:13:43,750 --> 00:13:44,790
And?

231
00:13:44,790 --> 00:13:45,920
You suffered from your pranks.

232
00:13:45,920 --> 00:13:46,590
What do you mean?

233
00:13:46,590 --> 00:13:48,260
Do you think I'll lose to him?

234
00:13:48,260 --> 00:13:49,890
I've come up with so many ways.

235
00:13:50,260 --> 00:13:51,660
I don't mean that.

236
00:13:52,560 --> 00:13:53,930
We're all adults.

237
00:13:53,930 --> 00:13:55,570
Can't you just talk nicely?

238
00:13:55,570 --> 00:13:56,300
Yeah.

239
00:13:56,300 --> 00:13:57,100
I don't care.

240
00:13:57,100 --> 00:13:58,070
I have to deal with him.

241
00:13:58,500 --> 00:13:59,470
Shu Yi.

242
00:14:02,710 --> 00:14:03,770
It's done?

243
00:14:04,740 --> 00:14:06,210
Remember to take pictures and send them to me.

244
00:14:09,480 --> 00:14:10,950
He's 21 years old already,

245
00:14:10,950 --> 00:14:12,020
still so wayward.

246
00:14:13,050 --> 00:14:14,180
No.

247
00:14:14,750 --> 00:14:16,920
I think being like that at 21

248
00:14:17,750 --> 00:14:18,790
is pretty cute.

249
00:14:25,560 --> 00:14:26,660
Remember to take pictures.

250
00:14:38,780 --> 00:14:41,810
Bing Wei's picture of
the prank plan is totally blurry.

251
00:14:44,110 --> 00:14:46,350
I have to deal with Gao Shi De.

252
00:14:47,720 --> 00:14:49,790
Fang Zheng Wen, be quick.

253
00:14:49,790 --> 00:14:51,190
OK.

254
00:14:52,460 --> 00:14:53,790
What's up?

255
00:14:54,090 --> 00:14:55,190
So mysterious.

256
00:14:55,190 --> 00:14:56,690
I have something to tell you.

257
00:15:01,600 --> 00:15:03,200
Fang Zheng Wen, do you hate me?

258
00:15:04,300 --> 00:15:05,070
No.

259
00:15:06,070 --> 00:15:07,070
You...

260
00:15:07,070 --> 00:15:08,370
don't hate me?

261
00:15:08,810 --> 00:15:11,070
What are you talking about? How is it possible?

262
00:15:11,070 --> 00:15:12,340
So you like me?

263
00:15:12,340 --> 00:15:14,040
Didn't I say that...

264
00:15:15,350 --> 00:15:16,880
Because I like you.

265
00:15:17,380 --> 00:15:19,250
Before I graduate, except for my thesis,

266
00:15:19,250 --> 00:15:21,080
I care about us the most.

267
00:15:22,550 --> 00:15:25,120
If you don't hate me,

268
00:15:25,120 --> 00:15:26,960
would you like to be with me?

269
00:15:33,160 --> 00:15:34,130
But

270
00:15:36,830 --> 00:15:39,200
Shu Yi and me.

271
00:15:39,840 --> 00:15:40,840
The three of us...

272
00:15:40,840 --> 00:15:42,170
I'm talking about you and me.

273
00:15:42,170 --> 00:15:43,240
Why do you mention Shu Yi?

274
00:15:45,610 --> 00:15:46,310
Shu Yi.

275
00:15:46,310 --> 00:15:47,410
Why are you here?

276
00:15:48,210 --> 00:15:49,880
Great!

277
00:15:49,880 --> 00:15:52,120
What good news!

278
00:15:52,120 --> 00:15:53,880
The three of us grew up together.

279
00:15:53,880 --> 00:15:55,290
You two are a couple now.

280
00:15:55,290 --> 00:15:56,620
Wonderful!

281
00:15:58,050 --> 00:15:59,260
Just say yes to her.

282
00:16:00,790 --> 00:16:02,430
I was worried this tomboy

283
00:16:02,430 --> 00:16:04,160
wouldn't get a boyfriend.

284
00:16:04,160 --> 00:16:04,990
Shu Yi, I didn't know...

285
00:16:04,990 --> 00:16:07,430
I'm relieved now that you're the one.

286
00:16:08,830 --> 00:16:10,600
I'd like to celebrate for you.

287
00:16:10,600 --> 00:16:12,000
How about tonight?

288
00:16:12,840 --> 00:16:13,900
-Shu Yi.
-Tonight,

289
00:16:14,600 --> 00:16:15,310
eight o'clock.

290
00:16:16,210 --> 00:16:17,740
-Shu Yi.
-I'll see you then.

291
00:16:20,110 --> 00:16:21,240
Why is he in a hurry?

292
00:16:21,980 --> 00:16:23,050
Is Shu Yi

293
00:16:23,450 --> 00:16:24,510
OK?

294
00:16:58,250 --> 00:16:59,380
What are you doing?

295
00:16:59,380 --> 00:17:00,980
It's dangerous running down the stairs!

296
00:17:02,550 --> 00:17:03,350
Are you OK?

297
00:17:05,350 --> 00:17:06,190
Ill-bred.

298
00:18:38,850 --> 00:18:40,710
Why Zheng Wen?

299
00:18:44,790 --> 00:18:46,890
Why choose him instead of me?

300
00:18:51,360 --> 00:18:52,790
Zheng Wen is an idiot.

301
00:18:54,930 --> 00:18:56,100
Yu Xin is a fool!

302
00:19:00,030 --> 00:19:02,000
Both of you are idiots!

303
00:19:04,400 --> 00:19:05,870
I tried so hard.

304
00:19:09,640 --> 00:19:11,480
Why do you do this to me?

305
00:19:41,810 --> 00:19:44,240
You said it was a custom-made lucky necklace.

306
00:19:53,150 --> 00:19:54,760
Not lucky at all!

307
00:22:16,360 --> 00:22:18,330
Did you know how you look just now?

308
00:22:18,330 --> 00:22:19,100
Do you want them to find out

309
00:22:19,100 --> 00:22:20,500
that you love Jiang Yu Xin?

310
00:22:21,270 --> 00:22:22,570
Recently,

311
00:22:22,570 --> 00:22:23,940
I need a page boy.

312
00:22:24,600 --> 00:22:25,610
You take the job.

313
00:22:25,610 --> 00:22:26,810
You have to be on-call

314
00:22:26,810 --> 00:22:27,940
and obey me

315
00:22:27,940 --> 00:22:29,180
until we graduate.

316
00:22:29,680 --> 00:22:30,640
No way!

317
00:22:30,640 --> 00:22:31,810
Wait and see.

318
00:22:31,810 --> 00:22:33,710
I'll defeat you hard.
