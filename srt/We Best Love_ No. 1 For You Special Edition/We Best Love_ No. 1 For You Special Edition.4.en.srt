The juniors did work hard on it.

14
00:00:52,980 --> 00:00:54,620
Are there really ghosts?

15
00:00:56,350 --> 00:00:59,020
Seriously? Who's that girl?

16
00:01:00,820 --> 00:01:04,760

Help me!

No, no!

00:01:30,320 --> 00:01:31,150

No.

23
00:01:31,850 --> 00:01:33,890
They didn't tell me there's such an area.

00:01:38,290 --> 00:01:38,730
Hurry.

29
00:01:41,260 --> 00:01:42,830
What is that?

30
00:01:46,670 --> 00:01:47,640
It's fake.

31
00:01:47,640 --> 00:01:48,770
It's just a costume.

32
00:01:48,770 --> 00:01:49,740
No...

33
00:01:49,740 --> 00:01:50,310
Impossible.

34
00:01:50,310 --> 00:01:50,970
They set it up.

35
00:01:54,240 --> 00:01:55,610
You've gone too far!

36
00:01:55,810 --> 00:01:57,280
Back off.

37
00:01:57,910 --> 00:01:58,750
Let's get out of here.

38
00:01:58,750 --> 00:01:59,580
Go. Let's leave.

39
00:02:01,650 --> 00:02:04,450
Don't go.

40
00:02:04,450 --> 00:02:06,150
I'm bored.

41
00:02:06,150 --> 00:02:08,090
Let's hang out.

00:02:08,090 --> 00:02:09,820
I'll carry you, go.

You're so good at this.

Fang Zheng Wen!

45
00:02:27,710 --> 00:02:28,840
I might kick your ass.

46
00:02:34,420 --> 00:02:35,850
Oh, my!

47
00:02:36,050 --> 00:02:37,620
It's my first night out.

48
00:02:37,620 --> 00:02:39,790
And this place is horrible.

49
00:02:40,560 --> 00:02:41,190
Gao Shi De.

50
00:02:43,930 --> 00:02:45,230
Are you afraid?

51
00:02:45,230 --> 00:02:46,530
Do you dare to sleep by yourself?

52
00:02:47,560 --> 00:02:48,030
Oh.

53
00:02:49,460 --> 00:02:50,670
I dare not.

54
00:02:50,670 --> 00:02:51,630
I was afraid you'd laugh at me.

55
00:02:51,630 --> 00:02:52,900
I don't laugh at my friends.

56
00:02:53,670 --> 00:02:54,740
Why don't you come over here?

57
00:02:55,370 --> 00:02:56,200
I'll protect you.

58
00:03:02,140 --> 00:03:03,510
Could you fall sleep?

59
00:03:07,150 --> 00:03:08,980
Move the bed a little closer.

60
00:03:08,980 --> 00:03:10,150
I'll talk to you.

61
00:03:29,540 --> 00:03:30,710
What do you wanna talk about?

62
00:03:33,610 --> 00:03:35,140
Well.

63
00:03:36,280 --> 00:03:38,650
What kind of person do you like?

64
00:03:40,220 --> 00:03:42,080
Personality, appearance,

65
00:03:42,080 --> 00:03:43,380
and the things he likes.

66
00:03:43,990 --> 00:03:45,350
Let me analyze it for you.

67
00:03:48,260 --> 00:03:50,190
You're curious about everything,

68
00:03:50,560 --> 00:03:51,860
aren't you?

69
00:03:52,330 --> 00:03:54,230
If you see me as your friend, just tell me.

70
00:04:05,010 --> 00:04:05,840
He...

71
00:04:11,280 --> 00:04:12,750
He's cute.

72
00:04:16,550 --> 00:04:17,950
Some people think

73
00:04:19,820 --> 00:04:21,620
he's arrogant

74
00:04:21,620 --> 00:04:23,290
and narcissistic.

75
00:04:24,690 --> 00:04:25,960
But in my eyes,

76
00:04:27,760 --> 00:04:29,260
he's just cute.

77
00:04:30,600 --> 00:04:32,430
You even like his disadvantages.

78
00:04:33,370 --> 00:04:34,840
True love, huh?

79
00:04:36,870 --> 00:04:38,070
Maybe.

80
00:04:41,540 --> 00:04:43,910
Though he's proud and stubborn,

81
00:04:45,410 --> 00:04:47,350
he's good to his friends.

82
00:04:48,980 --> 00:04:50,650
He'd protect his friends

83
00:04:51,090 --> 00:04:52,290
at all risks.

84
00:04:52,850 --> 00:04:53,990
He's loyal.

85
00:04:54,390 --> 00:04:55,960
That's an advantage.

86
00:04:57,730 --> 00:04:59,430
There are more.

87
00:05:01,700 --> 00:05:03,670
Aren't you going to tell him?

88
00:05:13,040 --> 00:05:14,740
We've just become friends.

89
00:05:15,140 --> 00:05:16,680
I don't wanna lose him so soon.

90
00:05:20,420 --> 00:05:22,220
We are the same.

91
00:05:23,250 --> 00:05:24,490
I understand you.

92
00:05:27,290 --> 00:05:29,120
I've moved on.

93
00:05:30,390 --> 00:05:32,330
You're still suffering.

94
00:05:32,330 --> 00:05:33,160
Poor man.

95
00:05:37,200 --> 00:05:39,630
Come to me if you need someone to talk to.

96
00:05:40,100 --> 00:05:41,300
I'll listen to you

97
00:05:41,900 --> 00:05:43,270
and keep your secrets.

98
00:05:45,070 --> 00:05:45,910
You're welcome.

99
00:05:51,610 --> 00:05:52,580
Thank you.

100
00:05:53,110 --> 00:05:56,780
If that person doesn't like you, his taste sucks.

101
00:05:58,820 --> 00:06:01,220
He's blessed to be loved by you.

102
00:06:04,290 --> 00:06:05,730
You are a good guy.

104
00:06:24,380 --> 00:06:25,680
Do me a favor.

105
00:06:26,680 --> 00:06:27,880
Sing for me.

106
00:06:29,920 --> 00:06:31,020
Me? Singing?

107
00:06:33,390 --> 00:06:35,060
I'm used to listening to music
before going to sleep.

108
00:06:37,260 --> 00:06:38,560
Come on, sing it.

109
00:06:39,990 --> 00:06:40,900
I...

110
00:06:41,700 --> 00:06:42,430
Come on.

111
00:06:42,900 --> 00:06:43,600
Sing.

the pretty and scary actress for the ghost.

00:11:33,150 --> 00:11:34,960
Senior Yu Xin!

157
00:11:37,190 --> 00:11:38,960
You're really good at being a female ghost.

158
00:11:39,990 --> 00:11:41,060
I'll kick your ass!

159
00:11:42,930 --> 00:11:43,960
Where's Shu Yi?

160
00:11:45,670 --> 00:11:47,070
I didn't see him.

161
00:11:47,470 --> 00:11:48,840
Didn't he come back with you?

162
00:11:50,170 --> 00:11:51,610
I thought he was behind you.

163
00:11:53,640 --> 00:11:54,880
No way!

164
00:11:55,180 --> 00:11:56,640
Shi De's not back either.

165
00:11:56,740 --> 00:11:57,680
How come!

166
00:11:58,610 --> 00:11:59,510
Hey.

167
00:11:59,780 --> 00:12:01,750
Are those the only places
where you've kept the clues?

168
00:12:02,920 --> 00:12:04,390
What's the matter?

169
00:12:04,650 --> 00:12:06,050
Two people aren't back yet.

170

What? Who?

171
00:12:08,620 --> 00:12:10,290
Zhou Shu Yi and Gao Shi De.

173
00:12:13,760 --> 00:12:16,730
Has anyone seen Shu Yi and Shi De?

174
00:12:19,230 --> 00:12:21,770
It's okay. They sent me a message.

175
00:12:21,770 --> 00:12:24,970
They said they were bored and went back first.

176
00:12:24,970 --> 00:12:26,640
-Are you guys bored?
-Give me the phone.

177
00:12:27,440 --> 00:12:29,210
(It's so boring!)

178
00:12:29,210 --> 00:12:30,510
(Zhou Shu Yi and I are leaving.)

179
00:12:30,510 --> 00:12:31,750
(Keep the phones for us.)

180
00:12:31,750 --> 00:12:32,510
(We'll get them tomorrow.)

181
00:12:32,510 --> 00:12:34,050
Zhou Shu Yi again!

182
00:12:35,720 --> 00:12:38,020
When did they get so close?

183
00:12:38,720 --> 00:12:39,950
How's your leg?

184
00:12:39,950 --> 00:12:40,860
Give it back.

185
00:12:42,060 --> 00:12:43,490
I'm fine!

186
00:12:44,090 --> 00:12:45,360
Coward!

187
00:12:47,330 --> 00:12:49,460
It's late already and this is it for tonight.
Why don't we go home and get some rest?

188
00:14:39,740 --> 00:14:40,640
Did you...

189
00:14:43,580 --> 00:14:44,810
confess your love?

190
00:14:44,810 --> 00:14:45,410
Get out.

191
00:14:53,250 --> 00:14:54,190
Beg me.

192
00:14:57,160 --> 00:14:58,260
Get out.

193
00:15:00,630 --> 00:15:01,830
Please!

194
00:15:38,270 --> 00:15:39,830
I meant it when I said

195
00:15:42,340 --> 00:15:43,500
I liked you

196
00:15:46,040 --> 00:15:46,870
yesterday.

197
00:15:50,840 --> 00:15:53,310
I also meant it when I said
I would get to you when you're hurt.

198
00:15:56,480 --> 00:15:58,290
But I'm not gonna do that to you.

199
00:16:02,790 --> 00:16:04,190
You said

200
00:16:06,790 --> 00:16:09,960
the person I like is lucky.

201
00:16:13,630 --> 00:16:15,600
But the lucky person

202
00:16:17,300 --> 00:16:18,710
has always been you.

203
00:16:24,280 --> 00:16:26,210
But you'll never know!

204
00:16:57,240 --> 00:16:58,210
Zhou Shu Yi.

205
00:17:02,050 --> 00:17:03,150
I like you.

206
00:18:00,840 --> 00:18:02,040
I'm going to play ball after class today.

207
00:18:02,040 --> 00:18:03,840
Sure. It's a beautiful day.

208
00:18:04,080 --> 00:18:05,050
Let's kick their asses off!

209
00:18:05,050 --> 00:18:06,250
You and me, together we are undefeatable!

210
00:18:08,180 --> 00:18:09,780
You came so early today.

211
00:18:10,150 --> 00:18:11,650
That's something new.

212
00:18:15,690 --> 00:18:17,420
You were so rude yesterday.

213
00:18:17,420 --> 00:18:19,760
How could you said it was bored and left like that?

214
00:18:20,090 --> 00:18:20,960
Yeah.

215
00:18:20,960 --> 00:18:22,600
We were trying to figure out how to scare you.

216
00:18:23,100 --> 00:18:24,570
But we didn't even see you.

217
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:29,670
Did you get the notes from yesterday's class?

218
00:18:29,670 --> 00:18:30,440
Give it to me.

219
00:18:30,440 --> 00:18:31,940
Of course not.

220
00:18:31,940 --> 00:18:33,310
I didn't even bring the textbook.

221
00:18:33,670 --> 00:18:34,580
Shame on you.

222
00:18:35,880 --> 00:18:37,340
Did you get the notes from yesterday's class?

223
00:18:37,340 --> 00:18:38,410
Give it to me.

224
00:18:39,010 --> 00:18:39,980
What notes?

225
00:18:40,480 --> 00:18:41,880
The notes that the professor said

226
00:18:41,880 --> 00:18:42,880
which would be in the exams.

227
00:18:46,620 --> 00:18:47,960
Ask Yu Xin

228
00:18:47,960 --> 00:18:49,060
if there's any dating party recently.

229
00:18:51,430 --> 00:18:52,960
You want a girlfriend?

230
00:18:53,260 --> 00:18:54,730
Yeah.

231
00:18:54,730 --> 00:18:56,300
Introduce some to me.

232
00:18:57,330 --> 00:18:58,770
What reminded you of that suddenly?

233
00:18:59,470 --> 00:19:02,500
You two displayed affection in front of me.

234
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:04,440
I'm gonna take revenge.

235
00:19:04,810 --> 00:19:05,940
Idiot.

236
00:19:05,940 --> 00:19:07,110
Please.

237
00:19:08,080 --> 00:19:09,110
All right.

238
00:19:09,110 --> 00:19:10,080
I'll talk to her.

239
00:19:54,290 --> 00:19:55,060
Hey.

240
00:19:55,920 --> 00:19:56,960
This is Zhou Shu Yi.

241
00:20:36,560 --> 00:20:37,330
Have you waited for long?

242
00:20:37,330 --> 00:20:38,300
No.

243
00:20:40,900 --> 00:20:42,200
Order whatever you want.

244
00:20:42,200 --> 00:20:43,000
My treat.

245
00:20:43,440 --> 00:20:44,540
OK.

246
00:20:45,740 --> 00:20:46,210
Thank you.

247
00:20:52,710 --> 00:20:53,950
(Where are you?)

248
00:20:53,950 --> 00:20:55,550
(We agreed to have dinner together.)

249
00:20:55,550 --> 00:20:56,320
(Damn idiot)
(Did You forgot it?)

250
00:20:56,320 --> 00:20:57,350
Anything wrong?

251
00:20:57,990 --> 00:20:58,650
It's okay.

252
00:20:59,150 --> 00:20:59,850
What would you like to eat?

253
00:21:00,790 --> 00:21:02,160
-Let me see.
-Okay.

254
00:21:16,170 --> 00:21:17,440
Well...

255
00:21:19,840 --> 00:21:22,040
Do you know where Shu Yi is?

256
00:21:29,850 --> 00:21:31,020
What's the matter?

257
00:21:31,020 --> 00:21:33,020
I've decided to learn to swim.

258
00:21:33,020 --> 00:21:35,890
You all are good at swimming.

259
00:21:35,890 --> 00:21:37,420
I want to take some photos of myself

260
00:21:37,420 --> 00:21:39,490
swimming in the sea.

261
00:21:40,090 --> 00:21:41,230
Look!

262
00:21:44,670 --> 00:21:45,430
Or...

263
00:21:45,430 --> 00:21:46,600
let's go and watch baseball games.

264
00:21:47,400 --> 00:21:48,570
When I'm free,

265
00:21:48,570 --> 00:21:49,740
I'd go to watch some baseball games

266
00:21:49,740 --> 00:21:51,470
and cheer for the players.

267
00:21:52,370 --> 00:21:53,410
Swimming.

268
00:21:53,410 --> 00:21:54,810
It sounds good.

269
00:21:55,410 --> 00:21:56,080
Or,

270
00:21:56,080 --> 00:21:57,810
maybe we should go bowling.

271
00:21:58,450 --> 00:21:59,610
(Shu Yi said)

272
00:22:00,450 --> 00:22:01,980
(he wanted a girlfriend?)

273
00:22:03,820 --> 00:22:06,190
A junior I know has liked him for long.

274
00:22:06,490 --> 00:22:08,160
So...

275
00:22:10,760 --> 00:22:14,430
Shu Yi and you are so close lately.

276
00:22:14,430 --> 00:22:15,460
Are you

277
00:22:15,460 --> 00:22:16,660
good friends?

278
00:22:17,760 --> 00:22:18,770
Right.

279
00:22:19,930 --> 00:22:20,730
Yeah.

280
00:22:21,770 --> 00:22:22,770
Friends.

281
00:22:23,800 --> 00:22:25,240
We're good friends.

282
00:22:27,970 --> 00:22:29,010
Yeah.

283
00:22:36,350 --> 00:22:37,620
I love shrimp the most.

284
00:22:37,620 --> 00:22:38,750
How about you? Do you like it?

285
00:22:38,750 --> 00:22:40,090
I do.

286
00:23:03,140 --> 00:23:04,010
Have a bite.

287
00:23:05,580 --> 00:23:07,110
Why would I think of him!

288
00:23:07,780 --> 00:23:09,750
Senior, how do you like the food?

289
00:23:12,090 --> 00:23:13,520
Are you free tomorrow?

290
00:23:13,520 --> 00:23:15,420
Shall we go to the cinema tomorrow?

291
00:23:16,190 --> 00:23:16,990
The food is good.

292
00:23:18,630 --> 00:23:20,460
I think it's delicious, too.

293
00:23:20,460 --> 00:23:21,160
So...

294
00:23:21,160 --> 00:23:23,200
Senior, do you like Korean food?

295
00:23:23,200 --> 00:23:24,530
I know a really good restaurant.

296
00:23:24,530 --> 00:23:26,470
Maybe we can go together next time.

297
00:23:26,970 --> 00:23:28,030
I'm busy tomorrow.

298
00:23:28,030 --> 00:23:29,570
I can't make it.

299
00:23:34,140 --> 00:23:35,880
He's so cold.

300
00:23:36,210 --> 00:23:39,180
Am I not being proactive enough?

301
00:23:39,180 --> 00:23:40,510
Zhou Shu Yi.

302
00:23:44,720 --> 00:23:46,690
Are you under the weather?

303
00:23:46,920 --> 00:23:49,320
You've been distracted all day long.

304
00:23:51,690 --> 00:23:52,660
Senior.

305
00:23:52,660 --> 00:23:54,460
Shu Yi.

306
00:23:55,430 --> 00:23:57,200
I...

307
00:24:04,470 --> 00:24:05,540
No!

308
00:24:09,480 --> 00:24:10,040
Ouch!

309
00:24:11,580 --> 00:24:12,310
Forget it.

310
00:24:12,310 --> 00:24:14,050
You don't really wanna date me.

311
00:24:14,310 --> 00:24:15,380
What?

312
00:24:16,080 --> 00:24:17,580
I have a class later.

313
00:24:17,580 --> 00:24:19,620
Thank you for your time today!

314
00:24:28,860 --> 00:24:29,900
Another hallucination!

315
00:24:34,670 --> 00:24:35,370
It hurts.

316
00:24:35,370 --> 00:24:36,640
It's true!

317
00:24:36,940 --> 00:24:38,440
What are you doing?

318
00:24:38,440 --> 00:24:39,810
It's all your fault!

319
00:24:39,810 --> 00:24:41,110
Now I twisted my ankle.

320
00:24:41,610 --> 00:24:42,510
I'll take you to the infirmary.

321
00:24:42,510 --> 00:24:43,580
No, thanks.

322
00:24:45,210 --> 00:24:46,450
Shall I carry you on my back or with my arms?

323
00:24:46,450 --> 00:24:47,280
Choose one.

324
00:24:49,080 --> 00:24:50,220
Just hold me.

325
00:24:50,680 --> 00:24:51,420
Hold me.

326
00:25:00,090 --> 00:25:01,260
He's not a doctor.

327
00:25:06,930 --> 00:25:07,630
Fine.

328
00:25:08,130 --> 00:25:10,270
It's my break anyway.

329
00:25:10,870 --> 00:25:12,310
Blame yourself for that.

330
00:25:12,810 --> 00:25:13,840
Figure it out yourself.

331
00:25:14,670 --> 00:25:15,610
Where's the bandage?

332
00:25:15,610 --> 00:25:16,410
I'll do it myself.

333
00:25:17,310 --> 00:25:18,680
But I run out of bandages.

334
00:25:18,680 --> 00:25:19,750
I'm gonna go get some.

335
00:25:20,810 --> 00:25:22,080
In the warehouse behind?

336
00:25:22,080 --> 00:25:23,220
Go ahead.

337
00:25:48,710 --> 00:25:49,980
What are you looking at?

338
00:25:50,680 --> 00:25:52,210
Well.

339
00:25:52,810 --> 00:25:54,080
I'm relieved.

340
00:25:57,480 --> 00:25:58,890
You're not as good as me.

341
00:25:59,550 --> 00:26:00,990
You won't attract Shi De.

342
00:26:01,220 --> 00:26:02,460
What do you mean?

343
00:26:03,960 --> 00:26:05,960
Don't you know that men would also like men?

344
00:26:06,360 --> 00:26:07,030
Kid.

345
00:26:07,930 --> 00:26:08,930
You like Gao Shi De...

346
00:26:08,930 --> 00:26:10,000
He'll be mine.

347
00:26:12,670 --> 00:26:13,630
Keep it a secret.

348
00:26:14,600 --> 00:26:15,970
I'm gonna get him next month.

349
00:26:16,670 --> 00:26:17,900
Wish me luck.

350
00:26:18,100 --> 00:26:19,340
Wish my ass!

351
00:26:19,870 --> 00:26:21,110
Who's gonna keep your secret?

352
00:26:21,110 --> 00:26:22,210
Forget it!

353
00:26:22,610 --> 00:26:24,610
Gao Shi De said he liked me.

354
00:26:31,450 --> 00:26:33,750
It seems

355
00:26:34,450 --> 00:26:36,060
that your secret is not a secret anymore.

356
00:26:46,400 --> 00:26:47,330
Pei Shou Yi.

357
00:26:48,170 --> 00:26:49,170
Yes?

358
00:26:50,400 --> 00:26:51,370
Don't go.

359
00:27:05,420 --> 00:27:07,050
Make it clear.

360
00:27:08,420 --> 00:27:09,620
No regrets, OK?

361
00:27:56,640 --> 00:27:57,440
What do you want?

362
00:28:17,860 --> 00:28:19,190
(Next Episode)
Yes, I like you.

363
00:28:19,190 --> 00:28:20,190
But it's none of your business.

364
00:28:21,130 --> 00:28:22,960
How can I give up someone I like?

365
00:28:22,960 --> 00:28:25,130
I know I'd fail.

366
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:27,030
Should I keep on trying?

367
00:28:27,030 --> 00:28:28,940
It is not that you will get something in return

368
00:28:28,940 --> 00:28:30,300
for your efforts when it comes to love.

369
00:28:30,670 --> 00:28:31,440
Miss me?

370
00:28:32,610 --> 00:28:33,740
I'm doomed.

371
00:28:33,740 --> 00:28:35,080
I think I've fallen for him.

372
00:28:35,940 --> 00:28:37,080
