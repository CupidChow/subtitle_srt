=No.1 For You Special Edition=

13
00:00:52,180 --> 00:00:53,550
(Lean on me.)

14
00:00:57,990 --> 00:00:59,360
(If possible,)

15
00:01:00,190 --> 00:01:01,560
(just look at me.)

16
00:01:03,930 --> 00:01:05,300
(Let me be with you.)

17
00:01:06,460 --> 00:01:07,830
(Don't be sad.)

18
00:01:10,100 --> 00:01:13,770
=Lesson 2=
(Let me take you away)

19
00:01:41,700 --> 00:01:43,070
What's wrong with you?

20
00:01:43,070 --> 00:01:44,370
Do you want to die?

21
00:01:44,370 --> 00:01:45,240
What's wrong with you?

22
00:01:45,240 --> 00:01:46,340
Why did you kiss me?

23
00:01:49,510 --> 00:01:50,870
You weren't coming up.

24
00:01:53,240 --> 00:01:54,410
None of your business!

25
00:01:54,410 --> 00:01:55,450
Why do you care?

26
00:01:56,250 --> 00:01:57,710
Do you like Jiang Yu Xin that much?

27
00:01:58,420 --> 00:01:59,520
Seeing her with Fang Zheng Wen

28
00:01:59,520 --> 00:02:01,180
makes you want to die?

29
00:02:02,490 --> 00:02:04,250
How do you know I like her?

30
00:02:04,250 --> 00:02:05,860
Were you stalking me?

31
00:02:08,630 --> 00:02:09,760
Yes, all the time.

32
00:02:14,430 --> 00:02:16,170
So that you can defeat me,

33
00:02:16,170 --> 00:02:17,570
make me a runner-up

34
00:02:17,570 --> 00:02:18,870
and laugh at me, right?

35
00:02:20,300 --> 00:02:22,170
I knew you didn't mean well.

36
00:02:22,170 --> 00:02:23,540
You see it now.

37
00:02:23,540 --> 00:02:24,440
Are you satisfied?

38
00:02:24,440 --> 00:02:25,480
Piss off!

39
00:02:28,010 --> 00:02:29,610
You don't have to pretend to be strong
when you're sad.

40
00:02:30,980 --> 00:02:32,280
I'm not sad.

41
00:02:32,280 --> 00:02:33,420
I'm happy to see them together.

42
00:02:33,920 --> 00:02:35,250
Very happy.

43
00:02:37,820 --> 00:02:39,020
See?

44
00:02:39,020 --> 00:02:40,060
Very happy.

45
00:02:45,100 --> 00:02:46,300
Zhou Shu Yi.

46
00:02:46,960 --> 00:02:48,600
Do you want to be beaten up?

47
00:02:49,370 --> 00:02:50,030
Get lost!

48
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:26,240
(Some people say that unrequited love
would never fail.)

49
00:03:26,740 --> 00:03:27,740
(Bullshit.)

50
00:03:27,740 --> 00:03:30,070
(When the one you love is with)

51
00:03:30,070 --> 00:03:32,210
(your good friend since childhood,)

52
00:03:32,940 --> 00:03:35,410
(it hurts more than being dumped.)

53
00:03:35,410 --> 00:03:37,310
(You'll feel the pain.)

54
00:03:37,310 --> 00:03:39,020
(You would rather destroy the world.)

55
00:03:39,580 --> 00:03:41,790
(It hurts so much that your world is gray)

56
00:03:41,790 --> 00:03:43,850
(on a sunny day.)

57
00:03:44,290 --> 00:03:46,020
(The turbulent wind precedes the mountain storm.)

58
00:04:02,510 --> 00:04:05,310
(The most painful part of losing your love isn't
that the one you like left you,)

59
00:04:05,640 --> 00:04:07,280
(but that you start to doubt yourself.)

60
00:04:07,810 --> 00:04:09,180
(Am I not good enough?)

61
00:04:09,180 --> 00:04:10,580
(Don't I deserve to be loved)

62
00:04:10,980 --> 00:04:13,150
(so she chose others?)

63
00:04:14,020 --> 00:04:16,650
(To get rid of the pain and save yourself from it,)

64
00:04:16,950 --> 00:04:19,590
(you have to tell yourself
that she is not the one.)

65
00:04:23,160 --> 00:04:24,590
(You have to force yourself to let go)

66
00:04:24,590 --> 00:04:27,000
(and believe someone must like you in this world.)

67
00:04:27,830 --> 00:04:29,370
(So I have to cheer up)

68
00:04:29,900 --> 00:04:31,840
(and find the right person.)

69
00:04:41,310 --> 00:04:42,180
Hi.

70
00:04:42,180 --> 00:04:43,610
Sorry, we're going to rehearse.

71
00:04:43,610 --> 00:04:45,150
Which club are you from?

72
00:04:45,680 --> 00:04:47,850
You're sitting on the chair for our rehearsal.

73
00:05:05,770 --> 00:05:07,070
What are you doing these days?

74
00:05:09,040 --> 00:05:10,470
I didn't see you anywhere.

75
00:05:17,150 --> 00:05:17,780
Shu Yi.

76
00:05:19,220 --> 00:05:20,620
I have something to discuss with you.

77
00:05:21,120 --> 00:05:23,020
Do you mind...

78
00:05:23,020 --> 00:05:24,620
Sorry, I'm late.

79
00:05:25,020 --> 00:05:26,060
I'm late.

80
00:05:26,060 --> 00:05:27,490
The tutor didn't let us leave.

81
00:05:27,960 --> 00:05:29,560
Come on. I'll treat you to lunch.

82
00:05:32,830 --> 00:05:34,500
You two just go and enjoy your meal.

83
00:05:34,500 --> 00:05:36,200
I don't want to be the third wheel.

84
00:05:36,700 --> 00:05:38,600
You know Fang Zheng Wen.

85
00:05:38,600 --> 00:05:40,300
I don't know if he's stupid or putting on airs,

86
00:05:40,300 --> 00:05:42,040
he hasn't given me an answer yet.

87
00:05:42,040 --> 00:05:44,440
But it's fine. I've waited for long anyway.

88
00:05:44,440 --> 00:05:45,340
If you don't give me an answer,

89
00:05:45,340 --> 00:05:46,480
think about the consequences!

90
00:05:46,480 --> 00:05:47,710
(Sometimes,)

91
00:05:47,710 --> 00:05:50,010
(reality could strike you hard.)

92
00:05:50,750 --> 00:05:52,280
(Who does she love?)

93
00:05:52,280 --> 00:05:54,250
(When did she fall for him?)

94
00:05:54,250 --> 00:05:56,120
(Since when have you been loved?)

95
00:05:56,490 --> 00:05:58,120
(All these are bloody cruel.)

96
00:05:58,120 --> 00:05:59,260
Zhou Shu Yi.

97
00:06:02,390 --> 00:06:03,630
I've finally found you.

98
00:06:03,930 --> 00:06:05,600
Did you forget
we're supposed to have lunch together?

99
00:06:06,860 --> 00:06:08,370
You have lunch with him?

100
00:06:12,640 --> 00:06:13,440
Come on.

101
00:06:13,440 --> 00:06:14,600
I have classes in the afternoon.

102
00:06:14,600 --> 00:06:15,210
Let's go.

103
00:06:15,210 --> 00:06:15,940
Bye-bye.

104
00:06:17,370 --> 00:06:19,440
When did they become so close?

105
00:06:20,640 --> 00:06:21,510
No idea.

106
00:06:21,510 --> 00:06:23,680
Is he up to any prank again?

107
00:06:23,680 --> 00:06:25,650
Why don't you stop him?

108
00:06:26,280 --> 00:06:27,180
You know him well.

109
00:06:28,450 --> 00:06:29,650
He looks like he doesn't care much,

110
00:06:30,520 --> 00:06:32,260
but he always keeps things to himself.

111
00:06:32,590 --> 00:06:33,560
Yeah.

112
00:06:33,560 --> 00:06:35,130
I wonder who will change him.

113
00:06:37,790 --> 00:06:38,960
Let go!

114
00:06:40,430 --> 00:06:41,600
Why do you grab me?

115
00:06:42,530 --> 00:06:44,170
Will you come with me if I don't?

116
00:06:44,500 --> 00:06:46,000
Did you know how you look just now?

117
00:06:46,340 --> 00:06:48,640
Do you want them to find out
that you love her?

118
00:06:49,340 --> 00:06:50,910
So what if they find out?

119
00:06:51,640 --> 00:06:52,540
Yeah.

120
00:06:52,740 --> 00:06:54,780
Then why did you hide and cry?

121
00:06:54,780 --> 00:06:55,780
Even jumped into the swimming pool.

122
00:06:56,110 --> 00:06:57,050
Excuse me?

123
00:07:02,850 --> 00:07:03,950
Zheng Wen is an idiot.

124
00:07:06,420 --> 00:07:07,760
Yu Xin is a fool!

125
00:07:08,960 --> 00:07:10,430
Both of them are idiots!

126
00:07:13,030 --> 00:07:14,800
I tried so hard.

127
00:07:15,400 --> 00:07:17,000
Why do you do this to me?

128
00:07:20,640 --> 00:07:21,710
What do you want?

129
00:07:22,210 --> 00:07:23,470
Do you want to show them?

130
00:07:23,470 --> 00:07:24,140
Bastard!

131
00:07:24,610 --> 00:07:26,340
I could have done that just now.

132
00:07:26,740 --> 00:07:27,780
What do you want?

133
00:07:27,780 --> 00:07:28,850
Why do you follow me all the time?

134
00:07:28,850 --> 00:07:30,010
Don't you have anything else to do?

135
00:07:30,610 --> 00:07:31,610
What do I want?

136
00:07:35,150 --> 00:07:36,490
Recently,

137
00:07:36,490 --> 00:07:37,890
I need a page boy.

138
00:07:38,520 --> 00:07:39,560
What about this?

139
00:07:41,060 --> 00:07:41,960
You take the job.

140
00:07:41,960 --> 00:07:43,230
You have to be on-call

141
00:07:43,230 --> 00:07:44,360
and obey me.

142
00:07:46,230 --> 00:07:47,130
Why should I?

143
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:49,300
Well...

144
00:07:51,940 --> 00:07:52,970
Go on.

145
00:07:54,040 --> 00:07:55,340
Do you think I'll be scared?

146
00:07:57,340 --> 00:07:58,210
Cool.

147
00:08:09,650 --> 00:08:10,690
How long?

148
00:08:11,620 --> 00:08:13,220
Not forever, right?

149
00:08:13,920 --> 00:08:15,460
Do you want to be in college forever?

150
00:08:15,460 --> 00:08:17,260
How dare you curse me!

151
00:08:18,860 --> 00:08:19,800
How long?

152
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:23,200
Until we graduate.

153
00:08:24,870 --> 00:08:25,970
Will I be paroled?

154
00:08:27,100 --> 00:08:28,440
Even prisoners have that.

155
00:08:28,770 --> 00:08:30,040
What are your conditions for a parole?

156
00:08:32,980 --> 00:08:33,710
Alright.

157
00:08:35,080 --> 00:08:36,810
If you beat me once,

158
00:08:36,810 --> 00:08:38,080
you'll be free.

159
00:08:40,780 --> 00:08:42,020
Anything will do?

160
00:08:42,020 --> 00:08:42,990
Anything.

161
00:08:44,490 --> 00:08:45,590
Let's wait and see.

162
00:08:45,590 --> 00:08:47,490
I'll defeat you hard.

163
00:08:47,490 --> 00:08:49,360
You'll admit that you are inferior to me.

164
00:08:57,100 --> 00:08:59,200
I'll send you my class schedule and the venues.

165
00:08:59,200 --> 00:09:01,340
Tomorrow morning, 8 AM. Downstairs of my house!

166
00:09:01,740 --> 00:09:03,040
If you're late...

167
00:09:03,040 --> 00:09:03,770
I see!

168
00:09:40,210 --> 00:09:41,710
Sit in the front.

169
00:09:42,010 --> 00:09:43,280
I'm used to taking the MRT.

170
00:09:44,880 --> 00:09:46,550
I'm used to sitting in a car.

171
00:09:47,920 --> 00:09:48,820
Cool.

172
00:10:00,260 --> 00:10:01,230
Are you satisfied?

173
00:10:01,230 --> 00:10:02,470
It's all your fault.

174
00:10:02,470 --> 00:10:03,970
You'd be late for the first class.

175
00:10:04,700 --> 00:10:06,640
You don't have class until two in the afternoon.

176
00:10:10,910 --> 00:10:12,340
I have your class schedule.

177
00:10:13,910 --> 00:10:16,150
Got my class schedule to pull pranks on me?

178
00:10:16,680 --> 00:10:17,710
Scheming boy.

179
00:10:20,150 --> 00:10:20,750
Let's go.

180
00:10:21,480 --> 00:10:22,590
My class is at 10 AM.

181
00:10:24,050 --> 00:10:25,920
Why do we have to meet at eight, then?

182
00:10:28,090 --> 00:10:29,260
For breakfast.

183
00:10:32,400 --> 00:10:34,300
I have to accompany you in class.

184
00:10:34,300 --> 00:10:35,470
Now breakfast as well?

185
00:10:36,170 --> 00:10:37,530
Come on, we're running late.

186
00:10:37,530 --> 00:10:38,540
Stay close.

187
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:41,370
OK, students, today we

188
00:10:41,370 --> 00:10:42,410
are going to talk about

189
00:10:42,410 --> 00:10:45,810
what information technology

190
00:10:45,810 --> 00:10:48,180
can be applied to increase

191
00:10:48,180 --> 00:10:49,580
the overall market liquidity.

192
00:10:49,580 --> 00:10:52,580
In fact, through information digging,

193
00:10:52,580 --> 00:10:54,350
we can provide customers with the most

194
00:10:54,350 --> 00:10:55,990
complete, correct, direct, and

195
00:10:55,990 --> 00:10:58,360
effective communication module.

196
00:10:59,290 --> 00:11:00,390
First of all, we can find out

197
00:11:00,390 --> 00:11:02,790
what kinds of customers

198
00:11:02,790 --> 00:11:04,960
we are facing

199
00:11:04,960 --> 00:11:09,930
through overall logical analysis.

200
00:11:09,930 --> 00:11:12,170
We can use big data

201
00:11:12,170 --> 00:11:14,000
to get people to know...

202
00:11:19,940 --> 00:11:20,580
Hey.

203
00:11:21,240 --> 00:11:22,410
Wake him up.

204
00:11:22,850 --> 00:11:24,780
It's embarrassed if the teacher sees it.

205
00:11:25,780 --> 00:11:26,580
It's OK.

206
00:11:27,780 --> 00:11:28,650
No.

207
00:11:29,120 --> 00:11:31,720
He's from Department of Economics and Management.
Why is he here?

208
00:11:33,220 --> 00:11:34,720
And he's sitting next to you.

209
00:11:34,720 --> 00:11:35,790
What does he want?

210
00:11:35,790 --> 00:11:36,630
Shh!

211
00:11:38,260 --> 00:11:39,500
Concentrate.

212
00:11:56,780 --> 00:11:58,150
After we return the books,

213
00:11:58,150 --> 00:11:59,350
let's grab something to eat.

214
00:11:59,350 --> 00:12:00,150
Alright, alright.

215
00:12:01,150 --> 00:12:03,150
There are two more classes in the afternoon.

216
00:12:03,720 --> 00:12:05,920
I'd be free between the two classes.

217
00:12:05,920 --> 00:12:06,790
Gao Shi De.

218
00:12:08,190 --> 00:12:09,460
I'm so hungry.

219
00:12:09,990 --> 00:12:11,060
Let's have lunch first.

220
00:12:13,400 --> 00:12:13,900
Hurry.

221
00:12:15,070 --> 00:12:16,000
I'm so hungry.

222
00:12:16,470 --> 00:12:17,100
Hey.

223
00:12:17,770 --> 00:12:18,940
How come it's your call?

224
00:12:26,380 --> 00:12:27,280
What are you doing?

225
00:12:28,710 --> 00:12:30,010
My foot hurts.

226
00:12:48,900 --> 00:12:50,170
How long do you have to hide from her?

227
00:13:00,310 --> 00:13:01,380
If you keep doing this,

228
00:13:01,680 --> 00:13:02,980
they will find out.

229
00:13:03,950 --> 00:13:04,850
I know.

230
00:13:04,850 --> 00:13:05,780
But...

231
00:13:07,350 --> 00:13:09,020
Seeing her still...

232
00:13:15,730 --> 00:13:17,590
I'm sad. It's my problem.

233
00:13:18,030 --> 00:13:19,230
If she knows about it,

234
00:13:20,030 --> 00:13:21,730
we can't be friends anymore.

235
00:13:25,500 --> 00:13:26,340
Idiot.

236
00:13:26,670 --> 00:13:28,040
You're the idiot.

237
00:13:30,470 --> 00:13:32,180
Why do I tell you this?

238
00:13:42,050 --> 00:13:43,650
You have to face it

239
00:13:43,990 --> 00:13:45,460
so you can let go.

240
00:13:47,160 --> 00:13:49,390
Love is not commodity.

241
00:13:49,390 --> 00:13:51,730
You can't put it back to the shelf
when  you don't like it.

242
00:13:53,300 --> 00:13:56,100
Only the inexperienced people would say this.

243
00:13:58,870 --> 00:13:59,700
I'm not inexperienced.

244
00:14:00,340 --> 00:14:01,170
Really?

245
00:14:03,310 --> 00:14:04,310
Is it Zhe Yu?

246
00:14:05,640 --> 00:14:06,480
Idiot.

247
00:14:06,940 --> 00:14:07,780
Huh?

248
00:14:08,610 --> 00:14:10,010
Are you scolding me, Gao Shi De?

249
00:15:39,940 --> 00:15:41,370
You're so smart.

250
00:15:41,770 --> 00:15:43,310
You're so smart..

251
00:15:45,240 --> 00:15:47,780
You sneak into the enemy's camp to spy on them.

252
00:15:48,880 --> 00:15:49,480
How is it going?

253
00:15:49,480 --> 00:15:50,310
Did you find any of his weak point

254
00:15:50,310 --> 00:15:51,210
that helps us teach Gao Shi De a lesson?

255
00:15:51,210 --> 00:15:53,620
Leave it. I'm quite busy.

256
00:15:53,620 --> 00:15:54,880
Why are you with Zhou Shu Yi

257
00:15:54,880 --> 00:15:56,720
all the time recently?

258
00:15:57,350 --> 00:15:58,560
What happened?

259
00:16:00,160 --> 00:16:00,920
Right?

260
00:16:01,690 --> 00:16:02,360
Yeah.

261
00:16:04,690 --> 00:16:05,460
Shi De.

262
00:16:15,040 --> 00:16:15,640
What are you doing?

263
00:16:16,470 --> 00:16:17,740
I don't want to eat so much meat.

264
00:16:22,480 --> 00:16:23,380
I want it, too.

265
00:16:27,720 --> 00:16:28,820
What?

266
00:16:32,320 --> 00:16:33,860
I don't want yours.

267
00:16:34,420 --> 00:16:35,790
All you know are eating and sleeping.

268
00:16:36,490 --> 00:16:38,330
If you sit on our class again,

269
00:16:38,730 --> 00:16:40,200
take a seat in the back.

270
00:16:40,530 --> 00:16:41,930
You might doze off

271
00:16:41,930 --> 00:16:42,900
and influence me and Shi De.

272
00:16:43,430 --> 00:16:46,070
Even so, Shu Yi would win over you.

273
00:16:46,900 --> 00:16:48,240
I'm talking to him. Why did you interrupt?

274
00:16:48,240 --> 00:16:49,040
So what?

275
00:16:49,040 --> 00:16:52,040
With the criteria of logical judgment,

276
00:16:52,040 --> 00:16:54,410
analyze customers' preference, purchasing time,

277
00:16:54,410 --> 00:16:55,610
properties of the purchased goods

278
00:16:56,050 --> 00:16:58,980
to find out whether they are married
and their social status.

279
00:16:58,980 --> 00:17:00,650
From that, we can tell
the related products they like.

280
00:17:03,520 --> 00:17:05,290
Some people can learn even when they are asleep,

281
00:17:05,990 --> 00:17:07,360
such as me.

282
00:17:11,530 --> 00:17:13,260
You still lose to Shi De all the time.

283
00:17:13,930 --> 00:17:15,630
Zhou Shu Yi  didn't lose.

284
00:17:15,630 --> 00:17:17,230
He lost to Shi De on purpose.

285
00:17:18,900 --> 00:17:20,270
It doesn't sound any better.

286
00:17:22,340 --> 00:17:23,470
I did lose.

287
00:17:23,470 --> 00:17:25,040
I won't deny it.

288
00:17:26,180 --> 00:17:28,450
You are quite honest, though.

289
00:17:31,350 --> 00:17:32,880
No empty seats?

290
00:17:33,920 --> 00:17:35,250
Over there.

291
00:17:37,190 --> 00:17:38,290
I'm leaving.

292
00:17:38,290 --> 00:17:39,160
I'll wait for you outside.

293
00:17:39,160 --> 00:17:40,190
I haven't finished yet.

294
00:17:41,560 --> 00:17:42,660
Not you.

295
00:17:43,290 --> 00:17:44,690
Shi De.

296
00:17:46,700 --> 00:17:47,500
Stop looking at me.

297
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:56,070
You've decided not to mess with
Gao Shi De.

298
00:17:56,570 --> 00:17:57,970
You two are good friends now?

299
00:17:57,970 --> 00:17:59,280
No way.

300
00:18:00,110 --> 00:18:01,540
I have to.

301
00:18:02,280 --> 00:18:03,480
Why?

302
00:18:04,280 --> 00:18:05,380
Anyway,

303
00:18:05,720 --> 00:18:06,650
leave it.

304
00:18:06,820 --> 00:18:07,680
Be quiet.

305
00:18:08,750 --> 00:18:09,450
But

306
00:18:10,090 --> 00:18:10,820
you hate him so much.

307
00:18:10,820 --> 00:18:12,420
Why are you so close to him now?

308
00:18:13,260 --> 00:18:14,190
Don't ask,

309
00:18:14,760 --> 00:18:15,430
or you'll be scared.

310
00:18:17,490 --> 00:18:18,460
That scary?

311
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:21,600
Very!

312
00:18:27,070 --> 00:18:28,470
Not bad.

313
00:18:29,210 --> 00:18:30,340
King of the game!

314
00:18:31,210 --> 00:18:31,980
Thank you.

315
00:18:32,710 --> 00:18:33,480
Nice.

316
00:18:34,580 --> 00:18:35,850
This is it!

317
00:18:36,710 --> 00:18:37,780
Huh?

318
00:18:40,020 --> 00:18:40,550
What?

319
00:18:40,600 --> 00:18:42,550
(Taipei City Shi Lin Public Market)

320
00:18:47,820 --> 00:18:49,330
That's what you want to compete?

321
00:18:50,230 --> 00:18:51,490
I've thought it through.

322
00:18:51,490 --> 00:18:52,900
We've competed in everything,

323
00:18:55,600 --> 00:18:56,730
except games.

324
00:19:05,040 --> 00:19:06,110
I thought...

325
00:19:06,980 --> 00:19:08,040
you asked me out for a date.

326
00:19:08,450 --> 00:19:09,610
No way.

327
00:19:09,610 --> 00:19:10,710
Who's going to date you?

328
00:19:12,120 --> 00:19:13,450
Tell me.

329
00:19:13,450 --> 00:19:14,280
In or out.

330
00:20:25,820 --> 00:20:26,720
I don't believe it!

331
00:20:28,220 --> 00:20:29,060
Next one.

332
00:20:49,480 --> 00:20:50,380
Thank you.

333
00:20:57,520 --> 00:20:58,290
What's next?

334
00:20:58,720 --> 00:20:59,660
Next one is...

335
00:21:07,130 --> 00:21:08,000
Zhou Shu Yi.

336
00:21:09,270 --> 00:21:11,230
You have a class tomorrow morning at eight,
just go back.

337
00:21:11,800 --> 00:21:12,600
Damn it!

338
00:21:13,370 --> 00:21:14,470
I'm really your page boy now.

339
00:21:41,300 --> 00:21:42,270
(He fell asleep.)

340
00:21:43,230 --> 00:21:44,570
(Go to hell!)

341
00:21:53,510 --> 00:21:56,350
(A good chance to check his cell phone.)

342
00:22:01,380 --> 00:22:02,890
(Wanna play with me?)

343
00:22:02,890 --> 00:22:04,490
(You are too amateur for that.)

344
00:22:10,760 --> 00:22:12,500
(Why isn't it in the bag?)

345
00:22:12,500 --> 00:22:13,560
(Where will it be?)

346
00:22:16,530 --> 00:22:18,440
(In his pocket.)

347
00:22:36,390 --> 00:22:37,950
(Why is it so hard to get?)

348
00:22:39,460 --> 00:22:40,620
(Almost there.)

349
00:22:45,800 --> 00:22:46,700
(Shit!)

350
00:22:47,230 --> 00:22:48,470
(What are you doing?)

351
00:22:49,770 --> 00:22:50,670
(Let go of me!)

352
00:22:51,070 --> 00:22:52,470
(Come on, let go!)

353
00:23:15,260 --> 00:23:17,030
I'm sorry.

354
00:23:17,030 --> 00:23:18,500
Shu Yi.

355
00:23:18,930 --> 00:23:21,060
Don't get angry.

356
00:23:21,430 --> 00:23:24,130
I thought you and Gao Shi De were together.

357
00:23:24,130 --> 00:23:26,670
How is that possible?

358
00:23:26,670 --> 00:23:28,100
I told you!

359
00:23:28,100 --> 00:23:29,240
But that day,

360
00:23:30,010 --> 00:23:31,410
I saw you...

361
00:23:31,410 --> 00:23:32,340
Bye.

362
00:23:33,680 --> 00:23:35,350
You have to face it.

363
00:23:35,350 --> 00:23:36,510
So that you can let go.

364
00:23:37,980 --> 00:23:39,750
Love is not commodity.

365
00:23:39,750 --> 00:23:41,850
You can't put it back to the shelf
when you don't like it.

366
00:23:42,290 --> 00:23:44,550
So I thought you two...

367
00:23:46,090 --> 00:23:47,820
Even if you really are,

368
00:23:47,820 --> 00:23:48,890
it doesn't matter.

369
00:23:48,890 --> 00:23:50,090
It's the modern age now.

370
00:23:52,160 --> 00:23:53,260
Don't listen to her nonsense.

371
00:23:53,260 --> 00:23:54,000
Listen.

372
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:55,230
I mean it.

373
00:23:55,230 --> 00:23:57,170
Go after it if you like him.

374
00:23:57,870 --> 00:23:59,800
Otherwise, he wouldn't know, right?

375
00:23:59,800 --> 00:24:01,770
Take us for an example,

376
00:24:01,770 --> 00:24:02,940
I am two years older than him.

377
00:24:02,940 --> 00:24:04,310
But you need to tell him.

378
00:24:04,310 --> 00:24:05,640
Be brave!

379
00:24:05,640 --> 00:24:06,680
So I'm telling you,

380
00:24:06,680 --> 00:24:07,840
I will support you.

381
00:24:14,620 --> 00:24:15,550
We have something else to do,

382
00:24:15,550 --> 00:24:16,450
we shall leave.

383
00:24:20,490 --> 00:24:21,760
They...

384
00:24:22,490 --> 00:24:23,530
are...

385
00:24:23,530 --> 00:24:24,960
Are they really not a couple?

386
00:24:26,130 --> 00:24:27,660
They seem so sweet.

387
00:24:29,800 --> 00:24:32,030
Just like you and me.

388
00:24:37,740 --> 00:24:39,240
Have more meat.

389
00:24:42,510 --> 00:24:45,080
Why do you make a spicy pot if you can't take it?

390
00:24:46,210 --> 00:24:47,450
Cuz you like it.

391
00:24:49,950 --> 00:24:51,490
How do you know that?

392
00:24:53,120 --> 00:24:54,620
I know you too well.

393
00:24:59,560 --> 00:25:00,730
Thank you...

394
00:25:01,290 --> 00:25:02,230
for just now.

395
00:25:09,270 --> 00:25:11,100
If you didn't take me away,

396
00:25:11,100 --> 00:25:12,570
they'd probably know it.

397
00:25:15,310 --> 00:25:16,510
That's how she's always been.

398
00:25:16,510 --> 00:25:17,980
She never knows what's going on.

399
00:25:17,980 --> 00:25:19,280
A bit bossy, too.

400
00:25:26,050 --> 00:25:27,690
Only Zheng Wen can stand her.

401
00:25:29,290 --> 00:25:30,960
They are a perfect couple.

402
00:25:37,060 --> 00:25:38,700
Is the shrimp ready?

403
00:25:39,370 --> 00:25:40,200
Yes.

404
00:25:51,780 --> 00:25:53,510
It seems that you don't care

405
00:25:55,950 --> 00:25:57,250
so much about Jiang Yu Xin now.

406
00:25:58,120 --> 00:25:59,550
Agree.

407
00:26:00,650 --> 00:26:01,560
Thanks.

408
00:26:09,060 --> 00:26:10,060
Actually,

409
00:26:10,860 --> 00:26:12,000
it's even sadder

410
00:26:12,500 --> 00:26:14,200
when you don't even

411
00:26:15,240 --> 00:26:17,070
have a chance to fight for your love.

412
00:26:17,900 --> 00:26:19,070
It ends before

413
00:26:19,470 --> 00:26:20,610
it starts.

414
00:26:21,980 --> 00:26:24,140
If your beloved one likes others,

415
00:26:24,140 --> 00:26:25,080
what would you do?

416
00:26:28,010 --> 00:26:29,020
Me?

417
00:26:35,120 --> 00:26:36,220
I will

418
00:26:36,890 --> 00:26:38,460
try to separate them

419
00:26:39,130 --> 00:26:40,430
and take advantage of it.

420
00:26:44,970 --> 00:26:46,370
Are you kidding me?

421
00:26:49,040 --> 00:26:50,340
Yes, I am.

422
00:27:10,490 --> 00:27:11,630
Gao Shi De.

423
00:27:12,490 --> 00:27:13,590
Would you allow your page boy

424
00:27:13,890 --> 00:27:15,030
to take a leave?

425
00:27:19,870 --> 00:27:20,930
Where are we going?

426
00:27:20,930 --> 00:27:22,040
Aren't you going to have a class?

427
00:27:22,040 --> 00:27:22,970
Slow down.

428
00:27:23,400 --> 00:27:24,540
Slow down.

429
00:27:32,380 --> 00:27:34,010
Do you want to die?

430
00:27:36,920 --> 00:27:39,520
This week, take light and oil-free food only.

431
00:27:40,850 --> 00:27:42,260
But if you want to die,

432
00:27:43,390 --> 00:27:44,660
have more spicy hotpot.

433
00:27:56,300 --> 00:27:57,570
(Next episode)
Do you like Yu Xin, too?

434
00:27:57,570 --> 00:27:59,110
Will you give Yu Xin to me?

435
00:27:59,110 --> 00:28:00,770
I thought you skipped classes for him

436
00:28:00,770 --> 00:28:01,810
so you can

437
00:28:01,810 --> 00:28:02,780
make him fall for you.

438
00:28:07,010 --> 00:28:07,880
You...

439
00:28:07,880 --> 00:28:09,020
You like me?

440
00:28:09,020 --> 00:28:10,320
You scared me!

441
00:28:10,320 --> 00:28:11,550
Follow me.

442
00:28:12,550 --> 00:28:13,520
