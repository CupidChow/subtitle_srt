=No. 1 For You Special Edition=

13
00:00:50,210 --> 00:00:52,450
Do you want to die?

14
00:00:55,220 --> 00:00:57,120
You have gastropathy.

15
00:00:57,220 --> 00:00:58,690
Why did you have spicy hotpot?

16
00:00:59,560 --> 00:01:00,560
What's wrong with you?

17
00:01:02,120 --> 00:01:04,090
College kids today are hard to understand.

18
00:01:06,730 --> 00:01:07,230
You, too.

19
00:01:08,500 --> 00:01:10,000
Make that for him every day

20
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:11,300
if you want him dead.

21
00:01:13,070 --> 00:01:14,040
Won't do that again.

22
00:01:14,670 --> 00:01:16,010
I had it.

23
00:01:16,010 --> 00:01:16,870
Why are you yelling at him?

24
00:01:18,040 --> 00:01:19,380
It's none of his business.

25
00:01:25,410 --> 00:01:27,550
In the US, the owner of a bar

26
00:01:27,550 --> 00:01:29,320
can be fined for not stopping a customer

27
00:01:29,320 --> 00:01:32,050
from drunk driving.

28
00:01:33,090 --> 00:01:34,960
He cooked it for you.

29
00:01:34,960 --> 00:01:36,260
I can absolutely yell at him.

30
00:01:44,500 --> 00:01:45,870
Zhou Shu Yi.

31
00:01:47,640 --> 00:01:49,170
This stomach medicine
can ease your pain for a while.

32
00:01:49,170 --> 00:01:50,340
But you still need to go to the doctor.

33
00:02:00,350 --> 00:02:02,920
You can eat light and oil-free food only.

34
00:02:04,220 --> 00:02:05,220
But if you want to die,

35
00:02:06,890 --> 00:02:08,460
have more spicy hotpots.

36
00:02:09,660 --> 00:02:12,130
How can a school doctor

37
00:02:12,130 --> 00:02:14,300
threat his patient?

38
00:02:14,750 --> 00:02:16,180
(School doctor)
(Pei Shou Yi)

39
00:02:20,270 --> 00:02:21,940
Are you sure this dummy is the one?

40
00:02:27,010 --> 00:02:28,640
You...

41
00:02:28,640 --> 00:02:29,650
Have some rest.

42
00:02:40,020 --> 00:02:41,160
Alright.

43
00:02:41,160 --> 00:02:42,660
I'll go and get a pack of cigarettes.

44
00:02:42,660 --> 00:02:44,890
You get some rest, kid.

45
00:02:48,330 --> 00:02:50,330
What's wrong with them?

46
00:02:50,600 --> 00:02:51,770
They look close.

47
00:02:53,770 --> 00:02:55,400
Are they...

48
00:02:59,480 --> 00:03:00,210
Ouch!

49
00:03:04,150 --> 00:03:05,010
Ouch!

50
00:03:09,590 --> 00:03:11,320
Why did you say that in front of him?

51
00:03:13,120 --> 00:03:14,490
Just for fun.

52
00:03:15,120 --> 00:03:17,160
Someone with affective disorder
can have fun too?

53
00:03:20,560 --> 00:03:22,160
Yeah, fun to watch.

54
00:03:25,630 --> 00:03:28,270
So that's my future cousin-in-law?

55
00:03:28,270 --> 00:03:29,840
Good-looking.

56
00:03:29,840 --> 00:03:31,810
Isn't it good?

57
00:03:31,810 --> 00:03:33,710
Nothing else but the look.

58
00:03:33,710 --> 00:03:35,640
But you don't know him well.

59
00:03:35,640 --> 00:03:37,950
I really can't tell.

60
00:03:37,950 --> 00:03:39,820
Maybe...

61
00:03:40,350 --> 00:03:42,020
I need to know more about him.

62
00:03:43,090 --> 00:03:43,820
Don't bother.

63
00:03:45,250 --> 00:03:46,620
There's no way that he likes me.

64
00:03:51,230 --> 00:03:52,500
And you still like him?

65
00:03:54,360 --> 00:03:55,500
He makes me

66
00:03:55,500 --> 00:03:57,300
who I am today.

67
00:03:58,330 --> 00:04:00,370
I met him at Grade 5.

68
00:04:02,710 --> 00:04:03,870
My parents got divorced

69
00:04:04,670 --> 00:04:06,140
that time.

70
00:04:06,680 --> 00:04:08,940
I was really sad.

71
00:04:09,580 --> 00:04:11,750
How could a little kid

72
00:04:11,750 --> 00:04:12,780
possibly accept the fact that his father

73
00:04:12,780 --> 00:04:14,950
abandoned the family?

74
00:04:16,620 --> 00:04:18,590
But I knew that

75
00:04:18,590 --> 00:04:20,190
my mom felt worse than me.

76
00:04:21,620 --> 00:04:23,160
So I pretended to be strong.

77
00:04:25,230 --> 00:04:27,230
But sometimes, I just couldn't help it.

78
00:04:35,640 --> 00:04:36,610
Hey.

79
00:04:36,610 --> 00:04:38,040
What's wrong with you?

80
00:04:38,040 --> 00:04:39,880
Are you hurt?

81
00:04:39,880 --> 00:04:40,980
Are you all right?

82
00:04:49,050 --> 00:04:49,690
Hey.

83
00:04:50,520 --> 00:04:52,590
Look at your snot and tears.

84
00:04:52,590 --> 00:04:53,720
So ugly.

85
00:04:55,790 --> 00:04:57,160
None of your business.

86
00:05:02,470 --> 00:05:04,000
My dad...

87
00:05:05,170 --> 00:05:07,400
abandoned me and my mom.

88
00:05:10,570 --> 00:05:12,480
You've still got a mom.

89
00:05:13,040 --> 00:05:16,750
My mom has gone to heaven.

90
00:05:25,450 --> 00:05:26,620
Or...

91
00:05:26,620 --> 00:05:28,560
I'll give you my dad.

92
00:05:28,560 --> 00:05:31,290
He always causes trouble.

93
00:05:33,030 --> 00:05:35,300
Nobody gives their dad away like that.

94
00:05:45,070 --> 00:05:46,040
How about this?

95
00:05:47,010 --> 00:05:49,140
I'll give myself to you.

96
00:05:49,140 --> 00:05:51,050
Let me know if you need anything.

97
00:05:51,050 --> 00:05:52,520
Think of me as your father.

98
00:05:56,320 --> 00:05:58,420
Good boy. That's a good smile.

99
00:05:58,420 --> 00:06:00,420
Don't waste your time crying.

100
00:06:00,420 --> 00:06:03,530
Work hard and be strong!

101
00:06:03,890 --> 00:06:05,060
Shu Yi.

102
00:06:06,300 --> 00:06:07,660
Where are you?

103
00:06:16,810 --> 00:06:19,010
Come to me if you want to cry.
I'll be there for you.

104
00:06:19,940 --> 00:06:21,240
My name is Zhou Shu Yi.

105
00:06:21,240 --> 00:06:23,180
I'm in Class 1 Grade 5 of
San Qiao Elementary School.

106
00:06:23,710 --> 00:06:24,750
Bye.

107
00:06:25,810 --> 00:06:27,580
Although it turned out

108
00:06:27,580 --> 00:06:31,150
that he was probably just passing by and
came to me out of curiosity.

109
00:06:31,150 --> 00:06:33,260
After I transferred to his school,

110
00:06:33,260 --> 00:06:35,090
he couldn't even recognize me.

111
00:06:35,820 --> 00:06:39,700
But he saved me that afternoon.

112
00:06:41,030 --> 00:06:42,260
You don't understand

113
00:06:42,260 --> 00:06:44,930
what his hug and shoulders

114
00:06:44,930 --> 00:06:47,000
meant to me

115
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:48,500
back then.

116
00:07:22,100 --> 00:07:23,270
I'm going to the class.

117
00:07:26,180 --> 00:07:28,080
I thought you'd skip class

118
00:07:28,740 --> 00:07:30,510
and let him know what you've done for him

119
00:07:31,380 --> 00:07:33,150
so that you can...

120
00:07:34,250 --> 00:07:35,080
make him fall for you.

121
00:07:41,060 --> 00:07:43,790
I just want to be his friend before graduation.

122
00:07:46,900 --> 00:07:48,000
Keep on with the unrequited love.

123
00:07:51,270 --> 00:07:53,340
Good, bro. You're a masochist.

124
00:07:55,970 --> 00:07:57,440
Fine.

125
00:07:57,440 --> 00:08:00,110
Anyway, you're going to America
with your mom after graduation.

126
00:08:00,810 --> 00:08:01,980
It's better this way.

127
00:08:04,010 --> 00:08:05,610
He wasn't lovelorn,

128
00:08:05,610 --> 00:08:08,120
I wouldn't have a chance to be his friend.

129
00:08:09,720 --> 00:08:12,490
So you want to help him go through it

130
00:08:13,090 --> 00:08:13,820
to return the favor?

131
00:08:15,820 --> 00:08:17,690
Are you a white crane?

132
00:08:17,690 --> 00:08:19,660
If you're so full of love,

133
00:08:19,660 --> 00:08:21,300
spread it.

134
00:08:22,200 --> 00:08:23,930
Don't you talk about me.

135
00:08:23,930 --> 00:08:25,730
This cup is broken and you...

136
00:08:31,670 --> 00:08:33,010
Careful with your mouth.

137
00:08:37,680 --> 00:08:38,850
I'll leave him to you.

138
00:09:21,220 --> 00:09:23,020
All right, that's all for today.

139
00:09:25,590 --> 00:09:26,460
Let's go.

140
00:09:26,460 --> 00:09:28,100
I'm busy.

141
00:09:30,670 --> 00:09:31,400
Shu Yi.

142
00:09:32,370 --> 00:09:33,700
Are you free?

143
00:09:34,240 --> 00:09:34,940
Why?

144
00:09:35,640 --> 00:09:37,870
We haven't had dinner together for a long time.

145
00:09:38,640 --> 00:09:39,710
I'm kind of busy.

146
00:09:46,150 --> 00:09:48,250
I was going to ask you...

147
00:09:50,950 --> 00:09:52,620
You...

148
00:09:52,950 --> 00:09:54,460
Do you also like Yu Xin?

149
00:09:57,290 --> 00:10:00,060
Don't you say you'd give up because of me.

150
00:10:00,060 --> 00:10:02,100
If you like her and she likes you,

151
00:10:02,100 --> 00:10:03,200
then it's good enough.

152
00:10:04,330 --> 00:10:05,100
But...

153
00:10:06,370 --> 00:10:08,240
last time you saw us...

154
00:10:09,340 --> 00:10:10,870
Are you OK with it?

155
00:10:14,010 --> 00:10:15,810
If I'm not OK with it,

156
00:10:16,080 --> 00:10:17,480
will you give Yu Xin to me?

157
00:10:24,790 --> 00:10:26,820
I don't want to lose a friend.

158
00:10:27,990 --> 00:10:29,660
But I like Yu Xin a lot.

159
00:10:30,860 --> 00:10:31,530
I can't do this.

160
00:10:33,290 --> 00:10:34,430
That's it.

161
00:10:34,430 --> 00:10:36,230
Protect your girlfriend and be tough.

162
00:10:36,230 --> 00:10:37,870
Never give her to anyone else.

163
00:10:39,170 --> 00:10:40,640
So...

164
00:10:40,640 --> 00:10:42,640
you don't like Yu Xin?

165
00:10:45,310 --> 00:10:47,140
I like...

166
00:10:48,380 --> 00:10:49,910
both of you!

167
00:10:52,780 --> 00:10:55,180
Come on. I was so worried.

168
00:10:55,180 --> 00:10:57,020
Take good care of her,

169
00:10:57,020 --> 00:10:58,550
or I'll beat you up.

170
00:10:59,490 --> 00:11:01,420
All right, all right!

171
00:11:02,260 --> 00:11:03,190
Fang Zheng Wen.

172
00:11:04,190 --> 00:11:06,660
You like her
but she expressed her feelings first.

173
00:11:06,660 --> 00:11:08,230
Is that what a man should do?

174
00:11:10,230 --> 00:11:12,170
Because I was worried about you.

175
00:11:13,430 --> 00:11:15,470
It's good that the one you love happens to

176
00:11:15,470 --> 00:11:16,740
love you back.

177
00:11:16,740 --> 00:11:18,140
I'm so jealous!

178
00:11:18,140 --> 00:11:19,240
All right.

179
00:11:19,240 --> 00:11:20,510
You need to treat me to dinner.

180
00:11:20,510 --> 00:11:21,440
Piece of cake.

181
00:11:21,440 --> 00:11:22,280
-Let's go.
-Go.

182
00:11:23,580 --> 00:11:24,510
What would you like to eat?

183
00:11:28,880 --> 00:11:30,150
Gao Shi De.

184
00:11:30,380 --> 00:11:31,150
Gao Shi De.

185
00:11:35,460 --> 00:11:36,760
How's your stomach?

186
00:11:39,090 --> 00:11:40,560
Zheng Wen talked to me.

187
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:42,030
About what?

188
00:11:42,430 --> 00:11:44,270
He asked me if I liked Yu Xin.

189
00:11:44,670 --> 00:11:46,230
I said ,"If I did,

190
00:11:46,230 --> 00:11:47,900
would you give her to me?"

191
00:11:47,900 --> 00:11:48,900
Seriously?

192
00:11:49,740 --> 00:11:51,110
He didn't even hesitate

193
00:11:51,440 --> 00:11:52,670
before refusing me.

194
00:11:54,980 --> 00:11:57,080
He's always been gentle.

195
00:11:57,510 --> 00:11:59,580
I didn't expect him to be so tough.

196
00:12:02,680 --> 00:12:04,190
I feel so happy.

197
00:12:06,050 --> 00:12:08,060
I hope he treats Yu Xin well,

198
00:12:08,390 --> 00:12:10,420
or I'll hit him hard.

199
00:12:13,360 --> 00:12:14,700
You're right.

200
00:12:16,230 --> 00:12:18,430
Time can heal everything.

201
00:12:19,870 --> 00:12:20,570
Great!

202
00:12:21,100 --> 00:12:21,740
Congratulations.

203
00:12:21,740 --> 00:12:22,370
All right.

204
00:12:22,370 --> 00:12:24,070
That's it, got it?

205
00:12:25,570 --> 00:12:29,110
Hey, here are the top two swimmers
of the swimming club.

206
00:12:33,280 --> 00:12:34,250
Do you want to come to

207
00:12:34,250 --> 00:12:36,850
the ghost night held by the juniors.

208
00:12:36,850 --> 00:12:40,190
It's like a farewell party.

209
00:12:40,190 --> 00:12:41,860
In a dark and scary night,

210
00:12:43,390 --> 00:12:46,990
the campus horror is waiting for you!

211
00:12:48,700 --> 00:12:49,530
And

212
00:12:49,530 --> 00:12:50,230
if you come,

213
00:12:50,230 --> 00:12:51,600
I'm sure the juniors

214
00:12:51,600 --> 00:12:53,730
will be super happy, right?

215
00:12:53,730 --> 00:12:55,740
Yes!

216
00:12:56,300 --> 00:12:57,470
I'm not going.

217
00:12:58,540 --> 00:13:00,780
Come on, man.

218
00:13:00,780 --> 00:13:02,110
You've been hanging out with him

219
00:13:02,110 --> 00:13:03,580
and ignored us.

220
00:13:04,210 --> 00:13:05,180
Tell you what.

221
00:13:05,180 --> 00:13:08,450
We've arranged some stage games.

222
00:13:08,450 --> 00:13:11,090
You'll get a nice present if you win.

223
00:13:11,090 --> 00:13:11,920
And

224
00:13:11,920 --> 00:13:14,660
it'll be much harder this time.

225
00:13:15,060 --> 00:13:17,060
No phones allowed!

226
00:13:17,060 --> 00:13:18,930
Show us how smart

227
00:13:18,930 --> 00:13:20,490
and brave you are!

228
00:13:22,400 --> 00:13:23,200
Come on!

229
00:13:23,200 --> 00:13:26,200
Let's create some good memories
before graduation!

230
00:13:26,200 --> 00:13:27,670
Alright, everyone?

231
00:13:27,670 --> 00:13:29,370
Yeah!

232
00:13:31,210 --> 00:13:33,910
-Competition?
-Memories before graduation.

233
00:13:38,050 --> 00:13:39,010
One more would be nice.

234
00:13:39,010 --> 00:13:40,820
I'll be free if I win.

235
00:13:49,320 --> 00:13:49,960
Did you hear that?

236
00:13:49,960 --> 00:13:51,460
Did you hear the footsteps?

237
00:13:51,460 --> 00:13:52,190
Huh?

238
00:13:52,190 --> 00:13:52,960
Footsteps?

239
00:13:52,960 --> 00:13:54,630
There it is.

240
00:13:54,630 --> 00:13:56,130
So terrible!

241
00:13:57,430 --> 00:13:58,530
I told you guys.

242
00:13:58,530 --> 00:13:59,830
I didn't lie to you.

243
00:13:59,830 --> 00:14:03,100
This is the third one who came out crying.

244
00:14:03,100 --> 00:14:05,310
I assume all of you a talisman, right?

245
00:14:05,310 --> 00:14:06,540
I'm not kidding.

246
00:14:06,540 --> 00:14:08,540
This school used to be a mass grave.

247
00:14:08,540 --> 00:14:09,940
You should take it seriously.

248
00:14:09,940 --> 00:14:11,680
Let's welcome our next challenger,

249
00:14:11,680 --> 00:14:12,910
Zheng Wen.

250
00:14:12,910 --> 00:14:13,950
Come on.

251
00:14:13,950 --> 00:14:15,050
Please.

252
00:14:15,050 --> 00:14:16,620
Please leave your phone here? Thank you.

253
00:14:20,050 --> 00:14:21,090
Don't be afraid, senior.

254
00:14:21,290 --> 00:14:21,860
I trust you.

255
00:14:21,860 --> 00:14:22,720
Let me go first.

256
00:14:23,190 --> 00:14:24,330
I'm in a hurry.

257
00:14:25,330 --> 00:14:27,190
And it's not scary at all.

258
00:14:27,190 --> 00:14:29,100
Alright, we've got

259
00:14:29,100 --> 00:14:30,200
a tough challenger.

260
00:14:30,200 --> 00:14:32,530
I hope he won't come out crying.

261
00:14:32,530 --> 00:14:33,370
Sorry, senior.

262
00:14:33,370 --> 00:14:36,370
Please wait for another 15 minutes.

263
00:14:37,970 --> 00:14:39,610
Let's stop here.

264
00:14:39,840 --> 00:14:41,340
So horrible.

265
00:14:41,340 --> 00:14:42,910
It's scary.

266
00:14:43,140 --> 00:14:43,940
Don't worry.

267
00:14:43,940 --> 00:14:45,110
I'll protect you.

268
00:14:45,110 --> 00:14:46,480
I won't leave you alone.

269
00:14:46,480 --> 00:14:47,850
Don't worry.

270
00:15:08,600 --> 00:15:10,240
Sorry.

271
00:15:19,280 --> 00:15:21,750
They've made it too scary.

272
00:15:24,150 --> 00:15:26,690
Liu Bing Wei, you can do this!

273
00:15:28,860 --> 00:15:29,860
Zhou Shu Yi.

274
00:15:30,620 --> 00:15:31,830
I'm coming to your rescue!

275
00:16:16,540 --> 00:16:17,740
What are you doing here?

276
00:16:17,740 --> 00:16:19,510
Did I scare you?

277
00:16:21,710 --> 00:16:23,480
So cute.

278
00:16:24,480 --> 00:16:26,080
The juniors asked me to join them.

279
00:16:26,080 --> 00:16:28,350
I wanted to give you
more nice memories about the university.

280
00:16:28,350 --> 00:16:30,920
Look. I even dressed like a ghost.

281
00:16:30,920 --> 00:16:32,490
You're here on your own?

282
00:16:33,520 --> 00:16:34,390
Well...

283
00:16:35,520 --> 00:16:38,190
I'll stay with you.

284
00:16:42,430 --> 00:16:43,660
You scared me!

285
00:16:43,660 --> 00:16:45,670
What are you doing back there?

286
00:16:45,670 --> 00:16:46,730
You got in the way.

287
00:16:47,600 --> 00:16:48,000
Oh.

288
00:16:49,900 --> 00:16:51,010
Go and win the games.

289
00:16:58,110 --> 00:16:59,150
I thought you had already let go of it.

290
00:17:01,250 --> 00:17:03,920
I'm just glad that they're happy together.

291
00:17:05,350 --> 00:17:06,520
You'd better concentrate.

292
00:17:06,520 --> 00:17:08,090
I'm gonna beat you this time.

293
00:17:17,460 --> 00:17:19,070
(Oh, my!)

294
00:17:19,070 --> 00:17:22,240
(When does the school get so scary?)

295
00:17:22,240 --> 00:17:23,970
(The flashlight is out of battery.)

296
00:17:26,570 --> 00:17:28,310
(Is Gao Shi De still here?)

297
00:17:30,410 --> 00:17:31,710
Why are you still here?

298
00:17:31,710 --> 00:17:32,650
Go ahead!

299
00:17:45,130 --> 00:17:46,590
I...

300
00:17:47,490 --> 00:17:48,860
I'm afraid of ghosts.

301
00:17:50,430 --> 00:17:51,570
Seriously?

302
00:17:51,570 --> 00:17:53,200
You're afraid of ghosts?

303
00:17:55,400 --> 00:17:56,640
Well then,

304
00:17:56,640 --> 00:17:58,440
let's stop competing with each other.

305
00:17:58,440 --> 00:18:00,410
I won't feel the sense of achievement even if I win.

306
00:18:00,410 --> 00:18:02,280
Let's just go together.

307
00:18:06,510 --> 00:18:07,380
Why are you standing still?

308
00:18:10,480 --> 00:18:11,490
Will I slow you down?

309
00:18:15,990 --> 00:18:17,790
Don't worry.

310
00:18:18,330 --> 00:18:19,690
I got your back.

311
00:18:28,070 --> 00:18:29,100
Come on.

312
00:18:31,170 --> 00:18:32,770
Don't be mincing.

313
00:18:32,770 --> 00:18:33,710
Just follow me.

314
00:18:47,750 --> 00:18:48,820
You go first.

315
00:18:49,220 --> 00:18:50,690
It's more scary in the back.

316
00:18:51,560 --> 00:18:52,390
Ready.

317
00:18:53,460 --> 00:18:55,100
Where is Shi De?

318
00:18:56,130 --> 00:18:59,200
Did you hear what I just said?

319
00:18:59,200 --> 00:19:00,770
Come on, come on!

320
00:19:01,400 --> 00:19:03,340
I'm begging you, come on.

321
00:19:03,340 --> 00:19:04,510
Sorry.

322
00:19:04,510 --> 00:19:06,610
I hit you too hard.

323
00:19:11,880 --> 00:19:12,480
What?

324
00:19:13,410 --> 00:19:14,450
Did you see Shi De?

325
00:19:15,720 --> 00:19:16,980
Did you see Zhou Shu Yi?

326
00:19:19,550 --> 00:19:21,090
What are you doing?

327
00:19:21,090 --> 00:19:22,360
Let's go together.

328
00:19:23,190 --> 00:19:23,820
Hands off.

329
00:19:24,360 --> 00:19:25,930
Don't follow me!

330
00:19:25,930 --> 00:19:27,190
Stop pulling.

331
00:19:27,190 --> 00:19:28,530
Let me go.

332
00:19:29,560 --> 00:19:31,230
You're insane!

333
00:19:41,310 --> 00:19:43,110
Too dramatic.

334
00:19:43,110 --> 00:19:45,650
Why did they hide the clue in the health center?

335
00:19:46,580 --> 00:19:47,310
Yeah.

336
00:19:48,320 --> 00:19:49,580
So dramatic.

337
00:19:53,820 --> 00:19:55,120
What's that noise?

338
00:19:56,790 --> 00:19:57,690
It's the wind.

339
00:20:02,460 --> 00:20:04,160
You better start looking for clues.

340
00:20:04,160 --> 00:20:05,570
Let's get out of here

341
00:20:05,570 --> 00:20:06,700
after we get the stamp.

342
00:20:07,100 --> 00:20:07,970
All right.

343
00:20:08,570 --> 00:20:10,000
You scared me.

344
00:20:10,340 --> 00:20:11,410
What's the matter?

345
00:20:12,440 --> 00:20:13,440
I'm afraid you're scared.

346
00:20:14,370 --> 00:20:15,380
I'm just telling you that I'm here.

347
00:20:18,550 --> 00:20:19,580
Idiot.

348
00:20:26,620 --> 00:20:28,420
Let's just leave it

349
00:20:28,420 --> 00:20:29,690
and go to the next one.

350
00:20:32,960 --> 00:20:34,290
No.

351
00:20:34,730 --> 00:20:36,200
If we don't get the stamp here,

352
00:20:36,460 --> 00:20:37,630
we won't get those for later stages.

353
00:20:39,800 --> 00:20:40,430
Oh.

354
00:20:46,370 --> 00:20:47,010
Don't be afraid.

355
00:20:47,010 --> 00:20:47,840
Don't be scared.

356
00:20:49,640 --> 00:20:50,510
Gao Shi De, let's get out of here!

357
00:20:50,510 --> 00:20:52,780
You need to calm down.

358
00:21:16,340 --> 00:21:17,440
Well done.

359
00:21:17,440 --> 00:21:18,610
Zhou Shu Yi.

360
00:21:19,840 --> 00:21:20,740
Hello!

361
00:21:20,740 --> 00:21:22,310
Anybody?

362
00:21:22,310 --> 00:21:23,840
Anyone out there?

363
00:21:23,840 --> 00:21:24,910
Hello!

364
00:21:26,080 --> 00:21:28,280
We're locked in here!

365
00:21:28,620 --> 00:21:29,780
Hello!

366
00:21:29,780 --> 00:21:31,150
Is there anyone out there?

367
00:21:31,150 --> 00:21:31,990
Hello!

368
00:21:32,750 --> 00:21:33,820
Anybody?

369
00:21:48,770 --> 00:21:50,200
You've yelled for ten minutes.

370
00:21:51,100 --> 00:21:51,940
Have some water.

371
00:21:55,580 --> 00:21:58,210
It's better than doing nothing.

372
00:21:59,710 --> 00:22:01,920
Why does a health center
need iron-grating windows?

373
00:22:03,820 --> 00:22:05,590
I thought you know this place well.

374
00:22:05,590 --> 00:22:07,550
Do something!

375
00:22:07,550 --> 00:22:09,390
What can I do?

376
00:22:09,390 --> 00:22:11,060
I don't have my phone with me.

377
00:22:12,460 --> 00:22:13,730
Perhaps...

378
00:22:13,960 --> 00:22:16,060
the school police will patrol around here.

379
00:22:17,930 --> 00:22:19,900
Or Shou Yi will come and open
the door tomorrow morning.

380
00:22:26,770 --> 00:22:28,340
You're not helping.

381
00:22:34,010 --> 00:22:35,780
The phone isn't working.

382
00:22:39,090 --> 00:22:41,050
There's a laptop here.

383
00:22:41,860 --> 00:22:43,760
It should have been connected to Wi-Fi.

384
00:22:43,760 --> 00:22:46,190
We can ask Zheng Wen to come and help us.

385
00:22:49,060 --> 00:22:50,700
Password sucks.

386
00:23:02,780 --> 00:23:03,380
Hungry?

387
00:23:09,480 --> 00:23:11,590
There's got to be some food here.

388
00:23:25,770 --> 00:23:26,670
Here we go.

389
00:23:32,870 --> 00:23:34,540
Do you have a secret crush on Pei Shou Yi?

390
00:23:37,680 --> 00:23:39,750
That's why you two are so close.

391
00:23:39,750 --> 00:23:41,920
You even know where he puts the instant noodles.

392
00:23:42,720 --> 00:23:44,050
How long has it been?

393
00:23:45,320 --> 00:23:46,850
Are you...

394
00:23:47,420 --> 00:23:49,320
You know my affairs.

395
00:23:49,820 --> 00:23:52,430
We're on the same boat.

396
00:23:52,830 --> 00:23:53,790
Relax.

397
00:23:53,790 --> 00:23:55,400
I won't laugh at you.

398
00:23:55,400 --> 00:23:56,900
How long has it been?

399
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:02,600
It's been long.

400
00:24:04,400 --> 00:24:05,770
It's just...

401
00:24:07,470 --> 00:24:08,840
I like you, not him.

402
00:24:10,010 --> 00:24:11,410
Then, I'm relieved.

403
00:24:16,280 --> 00:24:17,180
You...

404
00:24:17,180 --> 00:24:18,150
You like me?

405
00:24:19,690 --> 00:24:20,820
No way!

406
00:24:24,090 --> 00:24:25,060
Yeah.

407
00:24:25,930 --> 00:24:27,060
No way.

408
00:24:30,330 --> 00:24:31,730
You've got to be kidding me.

409
00:24:31,730 --> 00:24:33,270
Of course I am.

410
00:24:35,670 --> 00:24:37,970
You paired me up with Shou Yi.

411
00:24:38,870 --> 00:24:40,210
Miser.

412
00:24:42,340 --> 00:24:44,010
You like to talk back a lot.

413
00:24:59,190 --> 00:25:00,830
Just another minute.

414
00:25:25,820 --> 00:25:26,650
Here.

415
00:25:27,590 --> 00:25:28,690
Eat up.

416
00:25:55,720 --> 00:25:56,420
What about you?

417
00:25:59,820 --> 00:26:01,290
I'm not hungry. Just eat.

418
00:26:13,470 --> 00:26:15,170
Is this the only one left?

419
00:26:20,040 --> 00:26:21,910
You talk too much. Just eat it.

420
00:26:25,810 --> 00:26:27,380
Let's share it.

421
00:26:30,180 --> 00:26:32,520
We don't have to starve together.

422
00:26:32,950 --> 00:26:35,920
At least one of us won't be starved to death.

423
00:26:36,790 --> 00:26:38,530
You don't have to do this.

424
00:26:39,790 --> 00:26:40,890
That's what friends do.

425
00:26:43,830 --> 00:26:45,470
What did you say?

426
00:26:45,470 --> 00:26:46,800
Eat it or leave it.

427
00:26:51,810 --> 00:26:52,610
Alright.

428
00:27:04,480 --> 00:27:06,090
Though we are friends,

429
00:27:06,090 --> 00:27:08,090
we still get to compete.

430
00:27:08,090 --> 00:27:09,360
I won't lose to you forever.

431
00:27:12,490 --> 00:27:14,130
And I'm not gonna let you win.

432
00:27:40,590 --> 00:27:42,890
There is no winning or losing between us.

433
00:27:48,900 --> 00:27:50,630
That's what friends do.

434
00:27:57,340 --> 00:27:59,170
Maybe...

435
00:28:00,110 --> 00:28:01,610
it's better this way.

436
00:28:10,720 --> 00:28:17,990
=Lesson 3=
(It's been long)

437
00:28:32,810 --> 00:28:33,640
(Next Episode)
You want a girlfriend?

438
00:28:33,640 --> 00:28:34,270
Yeah.

439
00:28:34,270 --> 00:28:35,510
Introduce one to me.

440
00:28:35,510 --> 00:28:36,980
Aren't you going to tell him your feelings?

441
00:28:39,810 --> 00:28:41,310
You're not as good as me.

442
00:28:41,310 --> 00:28:42,650
Kiddo.

443
00:28:43,020 --> 00:28:43,880
You like Gao Shi De...

444
00:28:43,880 --> 00:28:45,190
He'll be mine.

445
00:28:47,190 --> 00:28:48,250
I like you.
