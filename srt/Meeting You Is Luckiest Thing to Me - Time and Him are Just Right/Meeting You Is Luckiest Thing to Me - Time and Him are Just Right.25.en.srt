Come.

19
00:01:52,360 --> 00:01:53,000
Follow me.

(Unremitting self-improvement,

22
00:02:04,640 --> 00:02:05,600
Do you trust me?

23
00:02:05,840 --> 00:02:06,840
Of course.

24
00:02:07,640 --> 00:02:08,880
Wait for me here.

25
00:02:08,880 --> 00:02:09,640
Don't move.

26
00:02:16,120 --> 00:02:17,040
Ji Junxing.

27
00:02:17,040 --> 00:02:18,160
Where are you going?

28
00:02:19,680 --> 00:02:20,760
Ji Junxing.

29
00:02:21,960 --> 00:02:23,520
You didn't tell me
how long you will be gone.

30
00:02:27,560 --> 00:02:28,560
Who is it?

31
00:02:30,800 --> 00:02:31,840
Ji Junxing!

32
00:02:49,760 --> 00:02:50,640
Lin Xi.

33
00:02:53,800 --> 00:02:54,480
Mianmian?

34
00:02:54,480 --> 00:02:55,480
Surprise.

35
00:02:57,640 --> 00:02:58,600
What's going on?

36
00:02:58,600 --> 00:03:00,120
Why are you all back here?

37
00:03:00,120 --> 00:03:03,160
- To witness your happiness!
- To witness your happiness!

Where's Ji Junxing?

39
00:03:23,760 --> 00:03:24,440
Lin Xi.

40
00:03:26,200 --> 00:03:27,520
Do you feel happy with me?

41
00:03:52,400 --> 00:03:53,320
Me too.

42
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:55,160
I feel very happy

43
00:03:55,160 --> 00:03:56,360
for the days I spent with you.

44
00:03:56,920 --> 00:03:58,680
So, I want to stay happy.

45
00:04:00,200 --> 00:04:02,240
Maybe we will still argue in the future.

46
00:04:03,360 --> 00:04:04,440
There might be

47
00:04:04,440 --> 00:04:06,160
many birthdays
that we can't spend with each other.

48
00:04:07,240 --> 00:04:09,840
There will be foolish
and sad misunderstandings.

49
00:04:11,480 --> 00:04:13,400
But I hope I can hold your hand

50
00:04:14,080 --> 00:04:15,680
and overcome
those difficulties together.

51
00:04:24,760 --> 00:04:26,400
It's upside-down.

52
00:04:36,520 --> 00:04:37,320
Lin Xi.

53
00:04:39,040 --> 00:04:40,240
Will you marry me?

54
00:04:43,840 --> 00:04:52,520
- Marry him!
- Marry him!

55
00:04:52,520 --> 00:04:53,800
I do!

56
00:05:05,880 --> 00:05:09,320

We thank everyone

63
00:05:17,640 --> 00:05:19,320
for helping Ji Junxing today.

(East Gate Barbecue)

69
00:05:34,200 --> 00:05:35,760
All of you are quite something.

70
00:05:35,760 --> 00:05:38,160
You were either on a business trip
or working overtime.

71
00:05:38,160 --> 00:05:39,600
Turns out everyone was lying to me.

72
00:05:39,880 --> 00:05:41,560
I didn't lie.

73
00:05:41,840 --> 00:05:42,680
I contributed

74
00:05:42,680 --> 00:05:43,960
all my annual leave to you.

75
00:05:44,200 --> 00:05:44,840
Yes.

76
00:05:44,840 --> 00:05:45,720
I even completed my thesis

77
00:05:45,720 --> 00:05:46,800
on the plane.

78
00:05:47,160 --> 00:05:48,440
I have to go on a business trip

79
00:05:48,440 --> 00:05:49,280
but that's tomorrow.

80
00:05:53,480 --> 00:05:54,320
Jiang Yimian.

81
00:05:54,640 --> 00:05:55,400
What about you?

82
00:05:55,400 --> 00:05:56,960
Why did you lie to me?

83
00:05:58,520 --> 00:05:59,240
It was me.

84
00:06:00,160 --> 00:06:01,760
I asked them to keep a secret

85
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:03,040
to surprise you.

86
00:06:04,640 --> 00:06:06,240
We wanted to surprise you

87
00:06:06,240 --> 00:06:07,600
but it almost became a scare.

88
00:06:07,840 --> 00:06:08,840
You scared us

89
00:06:08,840 --> 00:06:09,920
when you said you weren't coming.

90
00:06:11,800 --> 00:06:13,560
I'm very thankful to all of you.

91
00:06:13,880 --> 00:06:15,400
When I opened my eyes
and saw all of you,

92
00:06:17,320 --> 00:06:18,520
it felt like the past

93
00:06:18,760 --> 00:06:19,800
and nothing has changed.

94
00:06:22,160 --> 00:06:24,080
East Gate Squad won't change at least.

95
00:06:28,360 --> 00:06:29,040
Come.

96
00:06:29,040 --> 00:06:29,800
Let's drink another bottle.

97
00:06:29,800 --> 00:06:30,400
Come.

98
00:06:30,600 --> 00:06:32,280
Come. Cheers.

99
00:06:32,280 --> 00:06:34,320
- Cheers!
- Cheers!

100
00:06:37,920 --> 00:06:38,520
Ji Junxing.

101
00:06:38,760 --> 00:06:39,680
Lin Xi.

102
00:06:40,080 --> 00:06:40,400
Come.

103
00:06:40,400 --> 00:06:41,960
- Congratulations.
- Congratulations.

104
00:06:41,960 --> 00:06:43,080
Thank you.

105
00:06:46,880 --> 00:06:48,440
We finally gathered together.

106
00:06:48,440 --> 00:06:49,480
It's boring if we are just drinking.

107
00:06:49,720 --> 00:06:50,680
Let's tell a secret of ours

108
00:06:50,680 --> 00:06:52,000
during high school.

109
00:06:52,200 --> 00:06:53,880
Sure.

110
00:06:54,440 --> 00:06:55,520
I'll start.

111
00:06:57,760 --> 00:06:59,080
During high school,

112
00:06:59,600 --> 00:07:01,000
I liked Ji Junxing.

113
00:07:01,200 --> 00:07:02,640
Is that a secret?

114
00:07:02,920 --> 00:07:03,800
However,

115
00:07:03,800 --> 00:07:05,320
that's already in the past.

116
00:07:05,320 --> 00:07:06,760
Right now,

117
00:07:07,760 --> 00:07:08,920
I'm married.

118
00:07:11,840 --> 00:07:13,480
I'm very happy now.

119
00:07:13,480 --> 00:07:15,160
So, I want to thank the people

120
00:07:15,160 --> 00:07:16,680
who hiked with me.

121
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:18,840
Lin Xi, Ji Junxing,

122
00:07:18,840 --> 00:07:20,040
Jiang Yimian, Xie Ang

123
00:07:20,040 --> 00:07:20,960
and Gao Yunlang.

124
00:07:22,440 --> 00:07:23,360
Thank you, everyone.

125
00:07:23,360 --> 00:07:24,080
I won't be

126
00:07:24,080 --> 00:07:25,280
who I am today without you guys.

127
00:07:25,480 --> 00:07:26,920
I'm very fortunate
to spend the most wonderful

128
00:07:26,920 --> 00:07:28,120
three years of my life

129
00:07:28,120 --> 00:07:29,040
with you guys.

130
00:07:29,440 --> 00:07:29,800
Cheers!

131
00:07:30,280 --> 00:07:31,040
- Cheers!
- Cheers!

132
00:07:31,280 --> 00:07:32,680
Lin Xi, you must be happy.

133
00:07:32,680 --> 00:07:33,480
You too.

134
00:07:36,880 --> 00:07:38,040
Since Liu Yin told her secret,

135
00:07:38,040 --> 00:07:39,160
let me tell one as well.

136
00:07:39,480 --> 00:07:40,240
Jiang Yimian.

137
00:07:40,240 --> 00:07:41,400
You don't know this.

138
00:07:41,400 --> 00:07:42,560
After the basketball tournament,

139
00:07:42,560 --> 00:07:43,800
I wanted to confess to you.

140
00:07:44,120 --> 00:07:45,920
But Xie Ang intercepted me.

141
00:07:46,360 --> 00:07:47,640
He even fought with me

142
00:07:47,960 --> 00:07:49,720
and said
he would only marry Jiang Yimian.

143
00:07:55,640 --> 00:07:57,440
It took you so long to get water.

144
00:07:57,760 --> 00:07:58,440
You...

145
00:07:59,200 --> 00:08:00,320
What happened to your face?

146
00:08:01,440 --> 00:08:02,120
I'm fine.

147
00:08:02,120 --> 00:08:03,280
I slipped

148
00:08:03,280 --> 00:08:04,200
and hit the door.

149
00:08:04,920 --> 00:08:06,640
How did you hit the door
when you were only getting water?

150
00:08:06,640 --> 00:08:07,400
You're quite something.

151
00:08:24,560 --> 00:08:25,640
Keep drinking.

152
00:08:32,760 --> 00:08:33,560
Xie Ang.

153
00:08:33,560 --> 00:08:36,000
Ji Junxing already proposed to Lin Xi.

154
00:08:36,200 --> 00:08:36,760
When can we

155
00:08:36,760 --> 00:08:38,520
see you both get married?

156
00:08:39,932 --> 00:08:40,800
Enough.

157
00:08:40,880 --> 00:08:41,520
What's wrong?

158
00:08:41,520 --> 00:08:42,840
They broke up already.

159
00:08:47,040 --> 00:08:47,480
Come.

160
00:08:47,480 --> 00:08:48,360
Let's drink another round.

161
00:08:48,360 --> 00:08:49,320
It's such a happy day!

162
00:08:49,320 --> 00:08:50,200
Come!

163
00:08:50,200 --> 00:08:52,040
- Congratulations!
- Congratulations!

164
00:08:52,040 --> 00:08:52,520
Ji Junxing.

165
00:08:52,520 --> 00:08:53,600
You mustn't bully Lin Xi.

166
00:08:53,880 --> 00:08:55,080
Don't worry.

167
00:08:56,120 --> 00:08:56,800
Let's go.

168
00:08:56,800 --> 00:08:57,320
Come.

169
00:08:57,320 --> 00:08:58,480
Let's drink, everyone!

170
00:08:59,960 --> 00:09:01,600
Just drink. Sit down!

171
00:09:27,240 --> 00:09:29,970
(East Gate Barbecue)

172
00:09:30,880 --> 00:09:31,960
Take good care of yourself.

173
00:09:31,960 --> 00:09:32,720
You too.

174
00:09:33,680 --> 00:09:34,400
We'll be leaving.

175
00:09:34,400 --> 00:09:34,880
Okay.

176
00:09:34,880 --> 00:09:36,120
Bye.

177
00:09:36,120 --> 00:09:37,240
Take care on your way home.

178
00:09:37,240 --> 00:09:38,240
Sure. Take care.

179
00:10:23,240 --> 00:10:27,920
Actually, I have a secret too.

180
00:10:32,920 --> 00:10:36,920
Do you know when the time is

181
00:10:38,120 --> 00:10:39,480
when I first liked you?

182
00:10:46,440 --> 00:10:49,960
It was
at the spinning chair in Jingzhou.

183
00:10:55,760 --> 00:10:57,440
Since then,

184
00:10:58,760 --> 00:11:00,400
our relationship

185
00:11:01,280 --> 00:11:04,240
felt like I was sitting on top

186
00:11:05,600 --> 00:11:08,840
while you pushed me at the bottom.

187
00:11:14,720 --> 00:11:15,800
I thought

188
00:11:16,400 --> 00:11:18,520
you would never leave me.

189
00:11:21,160 --> 00:11:22,040
So,

190
00:11:23,800 --> 00:11:25,560
I took you for granted

191
00:11:27,720 --> 00:11:29,320
and enjoyed the way you treated me

192
00:11:29,480 --> 00:11:31,360
like it's
what you're supposed to do.

193
00:11:36,480 --> 00:11:37,200
However...

194
00:11:39,360 --> 00:11:42,440
However, I never thought

195
00:11:43,760 --> 00:11:45,680
that you would feel tired.

196
00:11:58,720 --> 00:11:59,920
Thank you.

197
00:12:02,440 --> 00:12:04,640
You've been tolerating my stubbornness

198
00:12:06,600 --> 00:12:10,600
and given me so many wonderful memories.

199
00:12:14,360 --> 00:12:15,320
I think

200
00:12:16,080 --> 00:12:19,440
I will never meet someone

201
00:12:19,960 --> 00:12:22,760
who treats me as well as you did.

202
00:12:25,160 --> 00:12:26,320
Me too.

203
00:12:28,920 --> 00:12:31,920
I will never treat anyone else

204
00:12:32,440 --> 00:12:34,080
like how I treated you.

205
00:12:41,160 --> 00:12:42,160
Sorry.

206
00:12:46,200 --> 00:12:47,400
My past self

207
00:12:48,680 --> 00:12:50,400
was really stubborn.

208
00:12:52,400 --> 00:12:53,360
If...

209
00:12:55,840 --> 00:13:00,200
If I get to do this all over again,

210
00:13:03,160 --> 00:13:05,200
I will definitely treat you better.

211
00:13:08,680 --> 00:13:09,680
However,

212
00:13:11,160 --> 00:13:12,760
I heard you are doing well now.

213
00:13:15,160 --> 00:13:16,240
They said

214
00:13:18,320 --> 00:13:20,840
a girl in the company likes you.

215
00:13:24,360 --> 00:13:25,600
I feel happy for you.

216
00:13:29,720 --> 00:13:30,720
I hope

217
00:13:31,400 --> 00:13:34,280
I get to hear good news about you soon.

218
00:14:24,520 --> 00:14:25,080
Everyone.

219
00:14:25,080 --> 00:14:25,920
Stand closer.

220
00:14:25,920 --> 00:14:26,600
Come.

221
00:14:28,320 --> 00:14:28,800
Good.

222
00:14:28,800 --> 00:14:30,120
Smile.

223
00:14:30,120 --> 00:14:32,160
Three, two, one.

224
00:14:32,160 --> 00:14:34,760
Happy wedding!

225
00:14:38,320 --> 00:14:40,480
Come! Three, two, one!

226
00:14:46,600 --> 00:14:47,600
After the ceremony,

227
00:14:47,600 --> 00:14:49,000
I have to rush back to England
to write my thesis.

228
00:14:49,680 --> 00:14:50,720
I'll go greet the guests.

229
00:14:50,720 --> 00:14:51,800
Once it's over,

230
00:14:51,800 --> 00:14:52,760
I'll go back at night.

231
00:14:55,480 --> 00:14:57,280
You do care about your buddy more.

232
00:14:57,600 --> 00:14:58,280
There's no choice.

233
00:14:58,280 --> 00:14:59,720
I have no girlfriend.

234
00:15:02,480 --> 00:15:02,960
Come.

235
00:15:04,360 --> 00:15:05,160
Lin Xi.

236
00:15:07,440 --> 00:15:08,360
I didn't expect you

237
00:15:08,360 --> 00:15:10,280
to be with Ji Junxing
all the way through.

238
00:15:10,680 --> 00:15:12,280
Thank you for coming to our wedding.

239
00:15:13,400 --> 00:15:13,880
However,

240
00:15:13,880 --> 00:15:15,120
I have to bless you today.

241
00:15:15,320 --> 00:15:16,600
You are really pretty today.

242
00:15:17,600 --> 00:15:18,320
Thank you.

243
00:15:22,520 --> 00:15:23,680
He's here.

244
00:15:25,160 --> 00:15:26,800
Isn't this Qin Kai from Art Class?

245
00:15:27,320 --> 00:15:28,040
Yes.

246
00:15:28,720 --> 00:15:29,720
He still won't give up?

247
00:15:29,720 --> 00:15:30,520
Right?

248
00:15:33,640 --> 00:15:35,080
Kai, you're finally here.

249
00:15:38,880 --> 00:15:40,600
You are still
putting on a flashy display.

250
00:15:40,600 --> 00:15:42,680
How dare you invite me
to be your best man.

251
00:15:42,680 --> 00:15:43,720
Aren't you afraid I will snatch her?

252
00:15:43,720 --> 00:15:45,200
- Do you think it's possible?
- Do you think it's possible?

253
00:15:47,520 --> 00:15:49,000
Treat Lin Xi well.

254
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:50,400
If I find out you bully her,

255
00:15:50,400 --> 00:15:51,520
I will beat you up.

256
00:15:53,800 --> 00:15:54,440
Lin Xi.

257
00:15:55,200 --> 00:15:56,040
You are so beautiful today.

258
00:15:56,840 --> 00:15:57,760
Thank you.

259
00:15:59,840 --> 00:16:00,840
You must be happy.

260
00:16:02,200 --> 00:16:02,920
I will.

261
00:16:08,120 --> 00:16:11,120
Thank you to all relatives and friends

262
00:16:11,640 --> 00:16:12,640
for attending

263
00:16:12,640 --> 00:16:14,200
the couple's wedding.

264
00:16:15,200 --> 00:16:17,840
I'm filled with emotions today.

265
00:16:19,960 --> 00:16:21,720
Looking back to the past

266
00:16:22,360 --> 00:16:23,680
and hoping for the future.

267
00:16:24,920 --> 00:16:27,280
I have some heartfelt words

268
00:16:27,680 --> 00:16:30,880
for our newlywed couple.

269
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:33,720
One,

270
00:16:34,440 --> 00:16:37,400
I hope both of them can do

271
00:16:37,400 --> 00:16:39,760
these four things
after they are married.

272
00:16:41,080 --> 00:16:42,560
Love each other.

273
00:16:43,240 --> 00:16:44,720
Respect each other.

274
00:16:45,640 --> 00:16:47,240
Complement each other.

275
00:16:47,720 --> 00:16:49,280
Help each other.

276
00:16:51,080 --> 00:16:51,760
Two,

277
00:16:52,760 --> 00:16:55,120
I hope both of them

278
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:57,840
can keep these four traits.

279
00:16:58,960 --> 00:17:02,320
Be filial to elders.

280
00:17:03,160 --> 00:17:04,800
Be passionate about work.

281
00:17:05,560 --> 00:17:07,680
Be loyal to friends.

282
00:17:08,080 --> 00:17:08,880
Xie Ang.

283
00:17:09,240 --> 00:17:10,800
Why does your father's wedding speech

284
00:17:10,800 --> 00:17:11,680
sound like

285
00:17:11,680 --> 00:17:13,200
a lecture from the Dean of Students?

286
00:17:14,040 --> 00:17:15,080
He did his best.

287
00:17:15,520 --> 00:17:16,520
He was excited for a few nights

288
00:17:16,520 --> 00:17:17,240
because of this.

289
00:17:17,240 --> 00:17:17,960
Let's invite the class monitor.

290
00:17:18,680 --> 00:17:19,440
No.

291
00:17:19,440 --> 00:17:20,160
Our emcee.

292
00:17:20,160 --> 00:17:20,960
Come here.

293
00:17:21,440 --> 00:17:22,960
I'll hand it over to you.

294
00:17:25,400 --> 00:17:26,560
Thank you, everyone.

295
00:17:27,320 --> 00:17:28,840
Thanks to our witness,

296
00:17:28,840 --> 00:17:31,120
Mr. Xie,
for his exciting speech as well.

297
00:17:31,440 --> 00:17:32,320
Next,

298
00:17:32,560 --> 00:17:34,000
we'll invite the children

299
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:36,400
to deliver the rings to our couple.

300
00:17:36,400 --> 00:17:38,280
Let's welcome
the flower girl and the ring bearer.

301
00:17:40,360 --> 00:17:41,200
So cute.

302
00:17:44,800 --> 00:17:45,640
They are cute, right?

303
00:17:51,400 --> 00:17:52,040
Baby.

304
00:17:52,040 --> 00:17:53,040
Keep walking.

305
00:17:53,560 --> 00:17:55,200
This box is too pretty.

306
00:17:55,200 --> 00:17:56,840
I don't want to give it to them.

307
00:17:57,640 --> 00:17:58,440
Baby.

308
00:18:00,520 --> 00:18:01,160
She ran away.

309
00:18:01,160 --> 00:18:01,880
What do we do now?

310
00:18:01,880 --> 00:18:02,880
The rings have escaped.

311
00:18:03,720 --> 00:18:04,600
We need to

312
00:18:04,600 --> 00:18:06,040
catch our own happiness.

1607.

336
00:19:22,400 --> 00:19:24,240
I don't think we should do this.

337
00:19:24,840 --> 00:19:25,920
The night is young.

338
00:19:25,920 --> 00:19:27,160
Let's have a chat with them.

339
00:19:27,560 --> 00:19:28,240
Yes.

340
00:19:28,240 --> 00:19:29,560
We are not causing trouble.

341
00:19:29,560 --> 00:19:30,440
We are just friends

342
00:19:30,440 --> 00:19:31,680
who want to give them a surprise.

343
00:19:31,920 --> 00:19:32,960
Let's go upstairs.

344
00:19:34,280 --> 00:19:35,000
Excuse me.

345
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:36,400
Are you

346
00:19:36,400 --> 00:19:37,760
Xie Ang, Jiang Yimian,

347
00:19:37,760 --> 00:19:40,720
Chen Mo and Gao Yunlang?

348
00:19:40,720 --> 00:19:41,320
That's right.

349
00:19:45,840 --> 00:19:47,520
Mr. Ji Junxing and Ms. Lin Xi

350
00:19:47,520 --> 00:19:48,840
left something for all of you.

351
00:19:49,120 --> 00:19:50,160
They are so considerate.

352
00:19:53,200 --> 00:19:54,120
What is this?

353
00:19:54,600 --> 00:19:55,560
There's a note.

354
00:19:59,360 --> 00:20:00,560
Surprise.

355
00:20:00,560 --> 00:20:01,520
When you see this,

356
00:20:01,520 --> 00:20:02,680
we are already on our way.

357
00:20:05,880 --> 00:20:07,400
We left you some fruit and melon seeds.

358
00:20:07,640 --> 00:20:08,480
Enjoy.

359
00:20:09,600 --> 00:20:10,360
Let me see.

360
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:14,880
Incredible.

361
00:20:14,880 --> 00:20:16,240
This is my first time
seeing the groom and bride

362
00:20:16,240 --> 00:20:17,720
eloping on the night of their wedding.

363
00:20:18,040 --> 00:20:20,520
Where can they go so late at night?

364
00:20:34,600 --> 00:20:36,600
Getting kidnapped on my wedding night

365
00:20:36,840 --> 00:20:38,960
and riding on a RV
while wearing a wedding dress.

366
00:20:39,640 --> 00:20:42,880
The domineering president
taking me to roam the world.

367
00:20:43,320 --> 00:20:44,200
I feel like

368
00:20:44,200 --> 00:20:46,040
the female lead of a third-rate novel.

369
00:20:46,480 --> 00:20:47,200
What?

370
00:20:47,520 --> 00:20:49,160
You don't sound happy.

371
00:20:49,360 --> 00:20:50,600
Thankfully, there's a RV

372
00:20:50,600 --> 00:20:51,880
at the wedding.

373
00:20:51,880 --> 00:20:52,680
Otherwise, we might be

374
00:20:52,680 --> 00:20:54,080
playing cards with Xie Ang.

375
00:20:54,280 --> 00:20:55,320
Yes.

376
00:20:55,320 --> 00:20:57,080
You are farsighted and crafty.

377
00:20:57,080 --> 00:20:58,400
There was chaos in the chat group.

378
00:20:58,400 --> 00:20:59,160
They said

379
00:20:59,160 --> 00:21:00,480
we are cunning.

380
00:21:00,800 --> 00:21:01,360
Not bad.

381
00:21:01,360 --> 00:21:03,160
The rabbit has become the old fox now.

382
00:21:03,720 --> 00:21:05,480
I only learned from you.

383
00:21:10,640 --> 00:21:11,800
To be honest,

384
00:21:12,200 --> 00:21:13,440
I have a trauma

385
00:21:13,440 --> 00:21:14,600
when I see a RV.

386
00:21:14,920 --> 00:21:17,360
I'm afraid
they might appear from somewhere.

387
00:21:19,040 --> 00:21:19,800
Don't worry.

388
00:21:20,040 --> 00:21:21,520
They won't be able to find the place

389
00:21:21,800 --> 00:21:23,040
that I'm taking you to.

390
00:21:23,960 --> 00:21:24,880
Where are we going?

391
00:21:26,360 --> 00:21:28,360
Anyway, that place

392
00:21:29,120 --> 00:21:29,880
is very beautiful.

393
00:21:44,120 --> 00:21:44,880
Stay safe.

394
00:21:44,880 --> 00:21:45,640
Take care.

395
00:21:46,240 --> 00:21:46,840
Take care.

396
00:21:50,040 --> 00:21:51,400
Take care.

397
00:21:52,680 --> 00:21:53,760
Take care, Buddy.

398
00:21:54,240 --> 00:21:55,120
Take good care of yourself.

399
00:21:56,640 --> 00:21:57,080
Go.

400
00:21:57,080 --> 00:21:58,120
Otherwise, we'll be late.

401
00:21:58,120 --> 00:21:58,640
Okay.

402
00:21:59,240 --> 00:22:00,920
We'll be leaving.

403
00:22:03,880 --> 00:22:04,560
We are leaving.

404
00:22:05,320 --> 00:22:06,440
Drive safe.

405
00:22:28,520 --> 00:22:30,440
I'll also be leaving.

406
00:22:36,040 --> 00:22:37,480
We still need to
go on our separate ways after all.

407
00:22:39,080 --> 00:22:39,760
Yes.

408
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:41,880
I'm heading in that direction.

409
00:22:47,920 --> 00:22:48,440
Take care.

410
00:22:51,560 --> 00:22:52,400

435
00:24:53,800 --> 00:24:55,480
Are those fireflies?

436
00:24:57,600 --> 00:24:59,600
I didn't see them since primary school.

437
00:25:06,480 --> 00:25:07,920
Did you

438
00:25:08,200 --> 00:25:09,840
really come up with this suddenly?

439
00:25:10,640 --> 00:25:13,360
Why do I feel like
you planned this for a long time?

440
00:25:13,960 --> 00:25:15,400
I did plan for a long time

441
00:25:15,400 --> 00:25:16,760
about marrying you.

442
00:25:19,440 --> 00:25:22,240
Since we are married,

443
00:25:23,000 --> 00:25:24,840
shouldn't we get down to business?

444
00:25:31,200 --> 00:25:32,200
What kind of business?

445
00:25:46,120 --> 00:25:47,720
A marriage contract?

446
00:25:48,320 --> 00:25:49,880
I thought it was something else.

447
00:25:50,640 --> 00:25:51,360
What else

448
00:25:51,360 --> 00:25:52,240
do you think it is?

449
00:25:52,800 --> 00:25:53,480
Here.

450
00:25:53,480 --> 00:25:54,920
First one. Who should cook?

451
00:25:56,040 --> 00:25:56,640
Me.

452
00:26:02,280 --> 00:26:03,080
Who should clean the dishes?

453
00:26:04,480 --> 00:26:05,400
Dishwasher.

454
00:26:06,440 --> 00:26:07,200
Who should sweep?

455
00:26:08,920 --> 00:26:09,960
Cleaning robot.

456
00:26:12,520 --> 00:26:13,120
Last one.

457
00:26:13,400 --> 00:26:14,400
Who manages the finance?

458
00:26:17,560 --> 00:26:18,640
Well...

459
00:26:19,640 --> 00:26:20,160
Forget it.

460
00:26:20,160 --> 00:26:21,160
We'll manage our own finance.

461
00:26:30,040 --> 00:26:30,640
Sign it.

462
00:26:33,200 --> 00:26:34,280
It's decided then.

463
00:26:38,880 --> 00:26:39,840
All right.

464
00:26:42,920 --> 00:26:43,960
We have come to an agreement.

465

Cheers.

466
00:26:58,040 --> 00:27:02,320
Do you think we get married early?

467
00:27:03,400 --> 00:27:04,280
It doesn't matter.

468
00:27:04,840 --> 00:27:05,480
We will be together

469
00:27:05,480 --> 00:27:06,720
no matter how long it is.

470
00:27:08,160 --> 00:27:09,000
Is that so?

471
00:27:09,520 --> 00:27:12,600
Being married
doesn't really feel different.

472

about writing the thesis?

525

My dear in-laws.

526
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:34,640
Try this boiled fish.

527
00:30:34,640 --> 00:30:35,560
My signature dish.

528
00:30:35,720 --> 00:30:36,520
What do you think?

529
00:30:37,440 --> 00:30:37,920
Here.

530
00:30:38,960 --> 00:30:39,400
Delicious.

531
00:30:41,520 --> 00:30:42,520
It's a little spicy.

532
00:30:42,520 --> 00:30:43,800
You can't eat spicy food?

533
00:30:43,800 --> 00:30:44,600
I can.

534
00:30:45,000 --> 00:30:45,720
Delicious.

535
00:30:45,840 --> 00:30:46,600
That's great.

536
00:30:47,240 --> 00:30:48,760
Try the steak I made.

537
00:30:49,720 --> 00:30:50,880
Is it cooked?

538
00:30:51,160 --> 00:30:52,280
I made it medium well.

539
00:30:56,000 --> 00:30:56,880
The medium-well steak

540
00:30:57,080 --> 00:30:58,040
is delicious.

541
00:30:58,040 --> 00:30:58,880
It's tender.

542
00:30:58,880 --> 00:30:59,400
Yes.

543
00:31:01,320 --> 00:31:02,840
If they stay together,

544
00:31:02,840 --> 00:31:04,240
it'll be very lively.

545
00:31:04,840 --> 00:31:06,000
I'm not sure about that

546
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:07,120
but our meals

547
00:31:07,120 --> 00:31:08,200
will be significantly better.

548
00:31:10,200 --> 00:31:10,640
Here.

549
00:31:11,240 --> 00:31:12,520
I didn't expect us

550
00:31:12,520 --> 00:31:13,920
to become a family.

551
00:31:14,520 --> 00:31:15,360
Don't worry.

552
00:31:15,720 --> 00:31:16,600
In the future,

553
00:31:16,840 --> 00:31:17,640
I will treat Lin Xi

554
00:31:17,640 --> 00:31:19,240
like my own daughter.

555
00:31:19,840 --> 00:31:20,840
You don't know.

556
00:31:20,840 --> 00:31:22,240
Back then,

557
00:31:22,240 --> 00:31:22,880
this person

558
00:31:22,880 --> 00:31:24,920
buried two jars of Nv'er Hong wine
in the backyard.

559
00:31:25,120 --> 00:31:26,520
But I let him down

560
00:31:26,720 --> 00:31:28,400
and gave birth to two sons.

561
00:31:29,400 --> 00:31:30,120
Mom.

562
00:31:31,560 --> 00:31:32,240
Xi.

563
00:31:32,640 --> 00:31:34,480
Can you agree to my request?

564
00:31:34,720 --> 00:31:35,680
Mom, tell me.

565
00:31:36,320 --> 00:31:37,200
Look.

566
00:31:37,200 --> 00:31:38,160
Your dad and I

567
00:31:38,160 --> 00:31:39,680
love children.

568
00:31:40,120 --> 00:31:40,680
Can the both of you

569
00:31:40,680 --> 00:31:42,400
give us grandchildren soon?

570
00:31:42,400 --> 00:31:43,040
Mom.

571
00:31:44,600 --> 00:31:46,920
It's bad to ask that during meals.

572
00:31:47,920 --> 00:31:49,680
Both of you should hurry up.

573
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:51,240
I want to become an uncle.

574
00:31:52,120 --> 00:31:53,520
You brat!

575
00:31:53,760 --> 00:31:54,600
Come.

576
00:31:54,600 --> 00:31:55,640
Let's drink.

577
00:31:55,960 --> 00:31:56,360
Come.

578
00:31:57,400 --> 00:32:00,280

00:32:08,640 --> 00:32:09,920

(Mom.)

582
00:32:11,840 --> 00:32:13,680
Our daughter will be much cuter.

583
00:32:13,680 --> 00:32:14,720
You don't have a daughter.

584
00:32:16,160 --> 00:32:16,960
You are right

585
00:32:19,280 --> 00:32:22,000
but I will soon have one.

Dad, wake up!

601
00:33:18,520 --> 00:33:20,320
Can we put this brat back inside

602
00:33:20,320 --> 00:33:21,440
and get a daughter instead?

603

604
00:33:22,600 --> 00:33:23,680
do it yourself.

607
00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:27,720
Don't disturb my sleep.

608
00:33:28,080 --> 00:33:29,800
Didn't I tell you

609
00:33:29,800 --> 00:33:31,000
to brush like this?

610
00:33:31,480 --> 00:33:33,120
Softer.

611
00:33:37,280 --> 00:33:37,720
Look.

612
00:33:37,720 --> 00:33:39,400
Your teeth are becoming whiter.

613
00:33:42,040 --> 00:33:43,920
Thank you for your diamond.

618
00:33:49,720 --> 00:33:51,320
a big diamond from Xie Ang.

619
00:33:51,920 --> 00:33:52,680
I want one too.

620
00:33:54,080 --> 00:33:54,880
Sure.

621
00:33:54,880 --> 00:33:55,680
I'll arrange it.

622
00:33:55,960 --> 00:33:57,240
You're just going to say yes?

623
00:34:00,560 --> 00:34:02,400
Something's wrong with your dad today.

624
00:34:03,520 --> 00:34:04,600
Softer.

625
00:34:22,720 --> 00:34:23,880
The pigeon egg you wanted.

626
00:34:24,760 --> 00:34:25,760
Buy one, get one free.

627
00:34:44,680 --> 00:34:45,960
It tastes all right

628
00:34:46,560 --> 00:34:47,600
but it's small.

629
00:34:47,600 --> 00:34:48,200
Is that so?

630
00:34:48,520 --> 00:34:49,320
Let me try it.

631
00:34:52,280 --> 00:34:53,000
Not bad.

632
00:34:53,000 --> 00:34:53,920
It's quite delicious.

633
00:34:57,080 --> 00:34:58,200
Both of you!

634
00:34:58,200 --> 00:35:00,360
Return my Little Gu!

635
00:35:04,280 --> 00:35:05,360
Your dad asked me to eat them.

636
00:35:05,360 --> 00:35:06,560
Your dad gave them to me.

637
00:35:06,920 --> 00:35:08,000
Yes! Hit him!

638
00:35:08,000 --> 00:35:09,200
How can you take...

639
00:35:11,200 --> 00:35:13,080
Didn't you ask for pigeon eggs?

640
00:35:15,240 --> 00:35:16,360
I'll help you catch him!

641
00:35:16,360 --> 00:35:17,320
Stop chasing me!

642
00:35:17,840 --> 00:35:18,560
Stop chasing me!

643
00:35:19,800 --> 00:35:20,440
It hurts!

644
00:35:21,840 --> 00:35:24,600
Are you going to hit your dad?

645
00:35:25,000 --> 00:35:25,680
Fireworks!

646
00:35:26,080 --> 00:35:26,960
Look!

647
00:35:26,960 --> 00:35:28,120
There are fireworks!

648
00:35:28,120 --> 00:35:28,800
Pigeon eggs!

649
00:35:28,800 --> 00:35:29,680
Forget the pigeon eggs!

650
00:35:29,680 --> 00:35:30,640
Stop playing!

651
00:35:30,640 --> 00:35:31,160
Come.

652
00:35:31,160 --> 00:35:32,080
Watch the fireworks.

653
00:35:32,080 --> 00:35:32,840
Let's go.

654
00:35:34,720 --> 00:35:36,160
Isn't it pretty?

655
00:35:36,160 --> 00:35:36,920
Yes.

656
00:35:36,920 --> 00:35:37,920
Is it pretty?

657
00:35:37,920 --> 00:35:39,360
Is it nice?

658
00:35:41,280 --> 00:35:42,200
Countdown.

659
00:35:42,600 --> 00:35:47,200
Five, four, three, two, one!

660
00:35:49,040 --> 00:35:51,240
Happy new year!

661
00:35:53,600 --> 00:35:54,560
Please take care of me

662
00:35:54,560 --> 00:35:55,680
in the new year.

663

665

Baby.

666
00:35:59,760 --> 00:36:00,960
Happy new year.
