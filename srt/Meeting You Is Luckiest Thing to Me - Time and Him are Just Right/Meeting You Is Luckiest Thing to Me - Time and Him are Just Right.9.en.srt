17
00:01:47,502 --> 00:01:48,342
What are you waiting for?

18
00:01:48,342 --> 00:01:49,062
Where is she?

19
00:01:51,462 --> 00:01:52,542
Maybe she has left.

20
00:01:53,302 --> 00:01:54,262
She has left?

21
00:01:55,502 --> 00:01:56,942
Without saying a word?

22
00:01:56,942 --> 00:01:57,902
This is unlike her.

23
00:01:57,902 --> 00:01:59,062
Did you two have a fight?

24
00:01:59,062 --> 00:01:59,902
How did I know that?

25
00:02:02,582 --> 00:02:03,902
I'm asking you questions.

26
00:02:09,382 --> 00:02:10,382
Wait for me.

27
00:02:18,120 --> 00:02:25,120
(Junzilan 119 Block)

28
00:02:28,142 --> 00:02:29,182
I've already put some salt in it.

29
00:02:29,182 --> 00:02:30,462
You don't have to put it again.

30
00:02:30,702 --> 00:02:32,102
Our daughter doesn't like salty food.

31
00:02:33,822 --> 00:02:35,462
Just listen to me.

32
00:02:35,462 --> 00:02:36,982
You don't have to do anything.

33
00:02:37,182 --> 00:02:38,782
Just wait and eat.

34
00:02:42,102 --> 00:02:43,222
I'm back.

35
00:02:45,822 --> 00:02:46,342
How is it?

36
00:02:46,342 --> 00:02:47,102
It's fine.

37
00:02:48,342 --> 00:02:49,302
It's quite spicy.

38
00:02:50,742 --> 00:02:51,182
It's spicy.

39
00:02:51,182 --> 00:02:52,462
Can the kid eat it?

40
00:02:52,462 --> 00:02:52,862
Lin Xi likes spicy food.

41
00:02:52,862 --> 00:02:54,422
If not, let's add some soup in it.

42
00:02:54,422 --> 00:02:55,582
Never mind, it's alright.

43
00:02:56,302 --> 00:02:58,462
Gosh, this kid.

44
00:02:58,862 --> 00:03:00,262
You freak me out.

45
00:03:01,542 --> 00:03:02,822
I didn't expect you to be so fast.

46
00:03:02,822 --> 00:03:04,222
I was going to pick you up.

47
00:03:04,222 --> 00:03:05,462
I miss you so much.

48
00:03:05,462 --> 00:03:06,502
So I came back right away.

49
00:03:07,262 --> 00:03:07,862
Okay, okay.

50
00:03:07,862 --> 00:03:08,742
Put your bag down.

51
00:03:08,742 --> 00:03:09,142
Well,

52
00:03:09,142 --> 00:03:09,702
it's filled with smoke here.

53
00:03:09,702 --> 00:03:10,542
Go on.

54
00:03:10,542 --> 00:03:12,102
It smells great, what are you cooking?

55
00:03:12,582 --> 00:03:13,542
It's a secret.

56
00:03:13,542 --> 00:03:14,302
A secret?

57
00:03:14,302 --> 00:03:15,622
I smelled Sichuan Boiled Fish
the moment I came in.

58
00:03:16,622 --> 00:03:17,022
Okay, just go.

59
00:03:17,022 --> 00:03:17,742
We're blown.

60
00:03:19,102 --> 00:03:20,142
Go and wash your hands.

61
00:03:20,142 --> 00:03:21,622
Sweet and Sour Pork.

62
00:03:22,022 --> 00:03:23,142
Did you wash your hands?

63
00:03:24,182 --> 00:03:24,862
Go wash your hands, hurry up.

64
00:03:24,862 --> 00:03:26,262
You didn't even take off your gloves.

65
00:03:26,742 --> 00:03:27,702
Geez.

66
00:03:28,342 --> 00:03:30,142
She never grew up.

67
00:03:30,142 --> 00:03:30,982
You're right.

68
00:03:31,862 --> 00:03:32,782
Eat more.

69
00:03:33,422 --> 00:03:34,942
It's indeed my dad's signature dish.

70
00:03:34,942 --> 00:03:36,142
I miss it so much.

71
00:03:39,102 --> 00:03:40,102
If you want to eat,

72
00:03:40,942 --> 00:03:41,982
hand over your result slip.

73
00:03:43,782 --> 00:03:44,502
Come on.

74
00:03:45,182 --> 00:03:45,742
Don't look at your mom.

75
00:03:45,742 --> 00:03:46,822
Look at my expression.

76
00:03:57,102 --> 00:03:58,862
Quick.

(Result Slip)
142 in English,

81
00:04:12,822 --> 00:04:14,782
288 in the comprehensive science test.

82
00:04:14,782 --> 00:04:17,102
You scored 699 in total.

83
00:04:17,502 --> 00:04:19,062
I'm in the second place in my class.

84
00:04:19,062 --> 00:04:19,902
Second?

85
00:04:20,302 --> 00:04:21,262
Mom.

86
00:04:21,262 --> 00:04:22,182
What's wrong with you?

87
00:04:22,182 --> 00:04:23,662
My daughter is amazing.

88
00:04:24,262 --> 00:04:25,222
In a school which has

89
00:04:25,222 --> 00:04:27,062
many talents like Chunhui High School,

90
00:04:27,062 --> 00:04:28,622
you actually can get
a good result like this.

91
00:04:28,622 --> 00:04:29,662
The second place.

92
00:04:30,102 --> 00:04:31,582
Are you going
to let her eat or not?

93
00:04:31,582 --> 00:04:32,182
Go ahead.

94
00:04:32,182 --> 00:04:33,382
I was just joking with you.

95
00:04:33,382 --> 00:04:33,782
Eat up.

96
00:04:33,782 --> 00:04:34,982
I can eat now, right?

97
00:04:34,982 --> 00:04:35,422
Of course.

98
00:04:35,422 --> 00:04:36,822
Eat as much as you like.

99
00:04:36,822 --> 00:04:38,382
The second place, that's great.

100
00:04:38,942 --> 00:04:39,582
Eat more.

101
00:04:40,942 --> 00:04:41,622
How does it taste?

102
00:04:44,262 --> 00:04:44,502
Dad,

103
00:04:44,502 --> 00:04:46,182
did you secretly go to the cooking school?

104
00:04:46,182 --> 00:04:47,342
Your cooking skill has improved a lot.

105
00:04:47,342 --> 00:04:48,102
You should gain

106
00:04:48,102 --> 00:04:49,862
ten more pounds.

107
00:04:50,302 --> 00:04:51,622
I'll give you a menu list later.

108
00:04:52,382 --> 00:04:54,502
Okay, I'll cook it for you.

109
00:04:55,222 --> 00:04:56,902
Why are you gobbling up
the food?

110
00:04:57,302 --> 00:04:58,542
Does the school provide
poor food?

111
00:05:00,422 --> 00:05:01,222
Not too bad.

112
00:05:01,502 --> 00:05:02,102
I've tried

113
00:05:02,102 --> 00:05:03,382
the canteen food
with Jiang Yimian.

114
00:05:03,662 --> 00:05:04,142
But Aunt Wen has

115
00:05:04,142 --> 00:05:05,342
treated me to many great meals.

116
00:05:05,342 --> 00:05:06,622
It was the food I've never tried before.

117
00:05:07,622 --> 00:05:08,102
By the way,

118
00:05:08,342 --> 00:05:09,902
how did Ji Junxing do
on the exam?

119
00:05:14,622 --> 00:05:15,542
Not too bad.

120
00:05:16,182 --> 00:05:16,942
What's his ranking?

121
00:05:18,782 --> 00:05:19,502
He's in the first place.

122
00:05:20,302 --> 00:05:21,182
No way.

123
00:05:22,422 --> 00:05:24,022
He's got a better result
than my daughter?

124
00:05:24,022 --> 00:05:25,342
As you and your tablemate got

125
00:05:25,342 --> 00:05:27,302
the first and second place,

126
00:05:27,302 --> 00:05:28,422
what about the others?

127
00:05:28,782 --> 00:05:29,462
That's enough.

128
00:05:29,462 --> 00:05:31,222
Let's eat.

129
00:05:31,222 --> 00:05:32,022
The food is getting cold.

130
00:05:32,302 --> 00:05:32,822
Eat more.

131
00:05:33,262 --> 00:05:34,222
You two are impressive.

132
00:05:34,222 --> 00:05:35,022
Amazing.

133
00:05:38,502 --> 00:05:40,102
You've done well

134
00:05:41,182 --> 00:05:42,142
in studying.

135
00:05:42,142 --> 00:05:43,822
Dad, Mom, I'm done.

136
00:05:43,822 --> 00:05:44,902
I'll get back to my room.

137
00:05:45,622 --> 00:05:46,662
You're done eating?

138
00:05:46,902 --> 00:05:48,342
There's still so much left.

139
00:05:48,342 --> 00:05:49,142
I'm full.

140
00:05:49,142 --> 00:05:50,102
She was tired on the road.

141
00:05:50,102 --> 00:05:51,462
I'll heat it up later
if she's hungry.

142
00:05:51,742 --> 00:05:52,542
Listen.

143
00:05:52,542 --> 00:05:53,062
Look.

144
00:05:53,062 --> 00:05:55,222
The teacher has noticed it

145
00:05:55,222 --> 00:05:56,142
and kept it in mind.

146
00:05:58,102 --> 00:05:58,862
Don't you think

147
00:05:58,862 --> 00:06:00,062
she's acting weird today?

148
00:06:01,262 --> 00:06:01,942
Is she?

149
00:06:03,982 --> 00:06:05,662
When we mentioned
about Ji Junxing,

150
00:06:05,662 --> 00:06:07,142
I found her strange.

151
00:06:09,142 --> 00:06:09,742
Could it be because

152
00:06:09,742 --> 00:06:11,262
they didn't get along with each other?

153
00:06:12,662 --> 00:06:13,862
Didn't get along?

154
00:06:14,622 --> 00:06:15,302
Did this brat

155
00:06:15,302 --> 00:06:16,462
bully our daughter?

156
00:06:16,462 --> 00:06:17,302
How dare he?

157
00:06:17,782 --> 00:06:19,142
Keep it down.

158
00:06:20,462 --> 00:06:21,302
Let's eat first.

159
00:06:25,142 --> 00:06:25,822
Could it be?

160
00:06:26,782 --> 00:06:27,582
Lin Xi,

161
00:06:27,702 --> 00:06:29,302
you've lost your phone, don't you?

162
00:06:29,342 --> 00:06:31,142
Your dad and I have bought you
a new one.

163
00:06:31,342 --> 00:06:32,342
Thanks, Mom.

164
00:06:39,760 --> 00:06:41,160
(Why did you leave without saying a word?
What's wrong with you? Give me a call when you reach home.)

165
00:06:43,182 --> 00:06:44,902
Why did you leave
without saying a word?

166
00:06:46,102 --> 00:06:47,582
I told Aunt about it.

167
00:06:49,942 --> 00:06:51,582
What's wrong with you?

168
00:06:52,902 --> 00:06:54,462
Don't you know it?

169
00:06:55,822 --> 00:06:56,742
Indeed, you don't know about it.

170
00:06:57,182 --> 00:06:58,182
After all, you didn't want me

171
00:06:58,182 --> 00:06:59,382
to hear you speaking ill of me.

172
00:07:02,062 --> 00:07:04,222
Give me a call
when you reach home.

173
00:07:07,302 --> 00:07:08,382
I won't do that.

174
00:07:14,542 --> 00:07:15,582
Didn't you say you don't like me?

175
00:07:16,262 --> 00:07:18,222
I don't like you either.

176
00:07:20,182 --> 00:07:20,942
Who cares?

177
00:07:43,102 --> 00:07:44,142
Why do you watch it again?

178
00:07:44,462 --> 00:07:45,382
If Jin Yong's novel is
on the college entrance exam,

179
00:07:45,382 --> 00:07:46,582
I'm sure you'll pass
with flying colours.

180
00:07:46,582 --> 00:07:47,462
Stop talking.

181
00:07:47,462 --> 00:07:48,262
It's a crucial moment.

182
00:08:01,182 --> 00:08:04,062
(Holiday is like a small time travel.)

183
00:08:04,902 --> 00:08:06,182
(In this world,)

184
00:08:06,182 --> 00:08:07,422
(there are no exams)

185
00:08:07,422 --> 00:08:08,542
(or teachers,)

186
00:08:08,982 --> 00:08:11,102
(the alarm won't go off
at six thirty in the morning.)

187
00:08:11,662 --> 00:08:12,862
(The last people I want to see)

188
00:08:12,862 --> 00:08:14,222
(can all be gone.)

189
00:08:23,062 --> 00:08:23,982
Xing,

190
00:08:23,982 --> 00:08:25,262
my life in the past two days

191
00:08:25,582 --> 00:08:26,982
(Lecture)
can only be described by a phrase.

192
00:08:27,262 --> 00:08:29,382
After a storm comes a calm
and the storm comes again.

193
00:08:30,022 --> 00:08:31,422
Life is like a roller coaster.

194
00:08:32,062 --> 00:08:34,142
As Mr. Xie saw that I didn't have
the spirit to study,

195
00:08:34,262 --> 00:08:35,662
so he wanted me
to come to this lecture.

196
00:08:35,982 --> 00:08:37,222
(Lecture)
To improve my motivation to study.

197
00:08:38,022 --> 00:08:40,222
Just that every cloud has
a silver lining.

198
00:08:40,622 --> 00:08:42,542
I can't believe I'll meet
Jiang Yimian here.

199
00:08:43,342 --> 00:08:44,582
Isn't that what you wanted?

200
00:08:45,702 --> 00:08:46,622
Unfortunately, she's always

201
00:08:46,622 --> 00:08:47,742
on the phone with Lin Xi.

202
00:08:47,742 --> 00:08:48,822
She doesn't answer me at all.

203
00:08:49,662 --> 00:08:51,502
There they go again.

204
00:08:52,062 --> 00:08:53,462
They act like they're
in a long distance relationship.

205
00:08:53,902 --> 00:08:55,222
They're talking on the phone?

206
00:08:55,222 --> 00:08:56,502
Lin Xi bought a new phone?

207
00:08:57,822 --> 00:08:59,222
It's not the point.

208
00:08:59,222 --> 00:09:00,742
The point is
that Jiang Yimian ignores me.

209
00:09:01,022 --> 00:09:02,342
Isn't that normal?

210
00:09:02,542 --> 00:09:03,342
Pass the phone to her.

211
00:09:03,462 --> 00:09:04,862
You want to help me enlighten her?

212
00:09:05,542 --> 00:09:07,022
I want to talk to Lin Xi.

213
00:09:07,582 --> 00:09:09,422
Why is everyone looking for Lin Xi?

214
00:09:09,422 --> 00:09:10,062
Why isn't there anyone looking for me?

215
00:09:10,062 --> 00:09:10,662
No way.

216
00:09:10,662 --> 00:09:12,022
After so many days,
you haven't made up with him yet?

217
00:09:12,022 --> 00:09:13,422
Are you trying to make
each other suffer to death?

218
00:09:14,382 --> 00:09:14,942
Who is it?

219
00:09:15,262 --> 00:09:16,062
Ji Junxing.

220
00:09:17,182 --> 00:09:17,862
Lin Xi,

221
00:09:17,862 --> 00:09:19,142
Ji Junxing wants to talk to you.

222
00:09:19,142 --> 00:09:19,782
You've won.

223
00:09:19,782 --> 00:09:20,582
Hold on a second.

224
00:09:23,280 --> 00:09:24,380
(Lucky Charm)

225
00:09:24,382 --> 00:09:25,462
Hello, Lin Xi.

226
00:09:25,600 --> 00:09:26,660
(Ji Junxing Lucky Charm)

227
00:09:31,302 --> 00:09:31,902
She hung up.

228
00:09:32,782 --> 00:09:33,502
What's going on?

229
00:09:37,462 --> 00:09:38,582
Ebbinghaus

230
00:09:38,582 --> 00:09:41,422
used meaningless syllable
as memory materials.

231
00:09:41,822 --> 00:09:43,502
He used the saving method
to calculate

232
00:09:43,502 --> 00:09:45,622
the amount that are retained
and forgotten.

233
00:09:46,222 --> 00:09:48,462
And based on his experimental result,

234
00:09:49,102 --> 00:09:50,622
he drew up a description.

235
00:09:52,022 --> 00:09:53,142
What's going on between them two?

236
00:09:54,022 --> 00:09:54,942
It goes without saying.

237
00:09:55,342 --> 00:09:56,662
Ji Junxing made her mad.

238
00:09:58,542 --> 00:10:00,022
Why must it be the boys' fault

239
00:10:00,022 --> 00:10:01,142
when you girls get mad?

240
00:10:01,822 --> 00:10:02,822
What if it's Lin Xi's fault?

241
00:10:06,782 --> 00:10:07,782
Say it again.

242
00:10:10,822 --> 00:10:11,822
I'm saying you're right.

243
00:10:12,302 --> 00:10:14,102
You girls are the right answers
of the universe.

244
00:10:15,102 --> 00:10:16,262
Ji Junxing is a scumbag.

245
00:10:17,182 --> 00:10:17,822
Can you lower your voice?

246
00:10:17,822 --> 00:10:18,542
Geez.

247
00:10:21,262 --> 00:10:23,382
That male student in a hat,

248
00:10:23,782 --> 00:10:24,502
stand up, please.

249
00:10:28,422 --> 00:10:30,822
What do you think about Ebbinghaus?

250
00:10:31,542 --> 00:10:32,502
Ebbinghaus.

251
00:10:34,182 --> 00:10:34,742
Ebbinghaus

252
00:10:34,742 --> 00:10:36,582
was a great scientist.

253
00:10:38,422 --> 00:10:39,182
Mathematician.

254
00:10:39,822 --> 00:10:40,742
Physicist.

255
00:10:42,062 --> 00:10:43,422
Sit down.

256
00:10:50,760 --> 00:10:53,950
(Knowledge Lecture
Improve study efficiency)

257
00:11:00,302 --> 00:11:01,142
It's you.

258
00:11:01,822 --> 00:11:02,542
I'm sorry.

259
00:11:02,862 --> 00:11:04,542
I didn't mean to embarrass you.

260
00:11:12,582 --> 00:11:13,502
Are you blind?

261
00:11:13,822 --> 00:11:14,782
You pee on my shoes.

262
00:11:15,462 --> 00:11:16,742
If you didn't kick me at the back,

263
00:11:16,742 --> 00:11:17,702
I wouldn't have peed
on your shoes.

264
00:11:18,102 --> 00:11:19,182
How dare you talk back to me?

265
00:11:19,342 --> 00:11:20,342
Students from No.3 High School.

266
00:11:27,382 --> 00:11:28,062
You're all here.

267
00:11:29,982 --> 00:11:31,102
Wipe it off first.

268
00:11:31,662 --> 00:11:32,582
What are you doing?

269
00:11:37,902 --> 00:11:38,502
Let go!

270
00:11:41,462 --> 00:11:42,342
Let go!

271
00:11:46,942 --> 00:11:47,702
I tell you what.

272
00:11:48,062 --> 00:11:48,782
I've been trained before.

273
00:11:49,542 --> 00:11:50,422
I've got a black belt in Taekwondo.

274
00:11:52,102 --> 00:11:53,222
Is that true?

275
00:11:54,062 --> 00:11:55,102
Trained, my foot!

276
00:11:55,502 --> 00:11:56,142
Run!

277
00:11:56,782 --> 00:11:57,702
Go after them!

278
00:11:59,582 --> 00:12:00,102
Run faster

279
00:12:00,102 --> 00:12:01,582
like when you avoid your dad.

280
00:12:01,702 --> 00:12:02,502
Stop right there.

281
00:12:02,742 --> 00:12:04,182
Hurry, they're catching up.

282
00:12:16,582 --> 00:12:17,222
Keep on running.

283
00:12:17,622 --> 00:12:18,622
Why do you stop?

284
00:12:19,422 --> 00:12:20,062
Dude,

285
00:12:20,422 --> 00:12:21,862
it's just a small matter,
we don't have to do this.

286
00:12:22,382 --> 00:12:23,062
I'll apologize

287
00:12:23,062 --> 00:12:23,902
for embarrassing you.

288
00:12:24,422 --> 00:12:25,142
Sorry.

289
00:12:25,742 --> 00:12:26,502
Apologize?

290
00:12:26,622 --> 00:12:28,262
Just forget about the fight.

291
00:12:28,262 --> 00:12:29,302
There's a girl here.

292
00:12:29,302 --> 00:12:30,302
We won't hit the girl.

293
00:12:30,582 --> 00:12:31,262
We'll only hit you.

294
00:12:32,142 --> 00:12:32,622
Jiang Yimian.

295
00:12:32,622 --> 00:12:33,502
Stop hitting him.

296
00:12:33,702 --> 00:12:34,502
Stop it.

297
00:12:34,542 --> 00:12:35,182
Hey!

298
00:12:39,182 --> 00:12:39,942
What are you doing?

299
00:12:45,822 --> 00:12:46,622
Who are you?

300
00:12:50,382 --> 00:12:51,382
Stop fighting.

301
00:12:58,462 --> 00:12:59,502
All of you, stop!

302
00:12:59,502 --> 00:13:00,462
Stop!

303
00:13:00,702 --> 00:13:01,702
That's enough!

304
00:13:01,942 --> 00:13:02,942
Ji Junxing, Xie Ang!

305
00:13:02,942 --> 00:13:03,942
Run!

306
00:13:29,502 --> 00:13:30,142
Xing,

307
00:13:30,502 --> 00:13:32,142
don't you think
Jiang Yimian and I were

308
00:13:32,142 --> 00:13:33,502
like the Condor Heroes just now?

309
00:13:34,222 --> 00:13:34,742
You were.

310
00:13:35,222 --> 00:13:36,662
She was the heroine
and you were the condor.

311
00:13:36,982 --> 00:13:37,862
A silly condor.

312
00:13:38,662 --> 00:13:39,422
Well,

313
00:13:39,662 --> 00:13:40,702
I know I implicated you.

314
00:13:41,382 --> 00:13:42,182
But why did you come

315
00:13:42,182 --> 00:13:43,062
all the way here?

316
00:13:43,782 --> 00:13:45,182
I'd like to ask Jiang Yimian
for a favor.

317
00:13:45,742 --> 00:13:47,022
To get Lin Xi's home address.

318
00:13:47,942 --> 00:13:49,342
Help me out with this later.

319
00:13:50,302 --> 00:13:52,142
This is pretty hard.

320
00:13:52,982 --> 00:13:55,222
You and Lin Xi are
in the middle of a fight.

321
00:13:55,542 --> 00:13:56,382
Jiang Yimian and Lin Xi

322
00:13:56,382 --> 00:13:57,502
are sworn friends.

323
00:13:58,182 --> 00:13:59,022
Will she tell you that?

324
00:13:59,902 --> 00:14:00,702
I'll outsmart her.

325
00:14:02,942 --> 00:14:04,062
Are you alright?

326
00:14:07,062 --> 00:14:07,902
I don't feel right.

327
00:14:09,062 --> 00:14:10,062
I'm a little dizzy.

328
00:14:13,342 --> 00:14:14,542
Are you suffering a concussion?

329
00:14:15,022 --> 00:14:15,902
You're so weak.

330
00:14:17,902 --> 00:14:19,502
Here, put a band-aid on it.

331
00:14:19,822 --> 00:14:20,382
Here.

332
00:14:20,382 --> 00:14:21,022
Thank you.

333
00:14:21,422 --> 00:14:22,582
Luckily, you came to find him.

334
00:14:22,582 --> 00:14:23,102
Or this fool

335
00:14:23,102 --> 00:14:24,142
would be busted up real bad.

336
00:14:24,822 --> 00:14:25,862
I wasn't here for him.

337
00:14:26,022 --> 00:14:26,902
I was here for you.

338
00:14:27,902 --> 00:14:29,462
You wanted to ask
about Lin Xi, didn't you?

339
00:14:30,182 --> 00:14:31,942
I don't know what's going on
between you two.

340
00:14:31,942 --> 00:14:33,422
But Lin Xi is very angry.

341
00:14:33,422 --> 00:14:34,502
The consequences are rather severe.

342
00:14:34,742 --> 00:14:36,222
I won't talk you up.

343
00:14:36,582 --> 00:14:37,262
I know.

344
00:14:37,582 --> 00:14:39,582
So I'd like to buy her
a present as an apology.

345
00:14:40,342 --> 00:14:41,262
But I don't know her address.

346
00:14:41,502 --> 00:14:42,742
That's right.

347
00:14:42,742 --> 00:14:44,542
Try everything you can

348
00:14:44,542 --> 00:14:45,822
to achieve your goal.

349
00:14:46,142 --> 00:14:46,702
In this world,

350
00:14:46,702 --> 00:14:48,382
there's no girl
who doesn't like presents.

351
00:14:48,382 --> 00:14:49,862
There are only boys
who give the wrong gift.

352
00:14:50,342 --> 00:14:51,542
Buy something expensive
and give her more.

353
00:14:51,742 --> 00:14:52,742
I've sent you her address.

354
00:14:56,142 --> 00:14:56,622
Okay.

355
00:14:56,862 --> 00:14:57,422
Well received.

356
00:14:57,742 --> 00:14:58,342
Thank you.

357
00:14:58,342 --> 00:14:58,862
Don't mention it.

358
00:14:58,862 --> 00:14:59,782
I'll get going, then.

359
00:14:59,782 --> 00:15:00,222
Okay.

360
00:15:03,062 --> 00:15:03,582
Bye bye.

361
00:15:03,902 --> 00:15:04,542
Bye bye.

362
00:15:07,582 --> 00:15:08,222
Mianmian,

363
00:15:09,022 --> 00:15:10,022
don't you think

364
00:15:10,222 --> 00:15:11,222
there was something wrong
about it?

365
00:15:11,542 --> 00:15:12,702
What's the problem?

366
00:15:12,702 --> 00:15:14,262
It's justified in giving girls presents

367
00:15:14,262 --> 00:15:15,262
to make them happy...

368
00:15:21,502 --> 00:15:22,302
Did I just

369
00:15:22,302 --> 00:15:23,902
give up Lin Xi's home address?

370
00:15:27,542 --> 00:15:28,622
It's your fault.

371
00:15:28,862 --> 00:15:30,102
Why didn't you remind me?

372
00:15:30,342 --> 00:15:31,742
What has it got to do with me?

373
00:15:31,742 --> 00:15:32,382
You...

374
00:15:42,040 --> 00:15:44,660
(Lin Supermarket)

375
00:15:49,022 --> 00:15:49,902
A bottle of mineral water.

376
00:15:50,222 --> 00:15:50,942
Two yuan.

377
00:15:52,622 --> 00:15:53,262
It's not for sale.

378
00:15:54,622 --> 00:15:55,502
Forget it.

379
00:15:55,502 --> 00:15:56,942
Anyway, I'm not here to buy water.

380
00:15:57,422 --> 00:15:58,302
I left you a message on QQ.

381
00:15:58,302 --> 00:15:59,262
Why didn't you reply me?

382
00:15:59,262 --> 00:16:00,502
Did you leave me a message?

383
00:16:00,502 --> 00:16:01,302
I didn't see it.

384
00:16:01,862 --> 00:16:03,422
It showed that you were online.

385
00:16:05,742 --> 00:16:06,662
It meant I didn't want to reply.

386
00:16:09,982 --> 00:16:11,142
Are you mad at me?

387
00:16:11,142 --> 00:16:12,342
Why would I be mad at you?

388
00:16:16,782 --> 00:16:17,382
Okay, then.

389
00:16:19,382 --> 00:16:20,022
What are you doing?

390
00:16:20,822 --> 00:16:22,182
Anyway, I'm a customer now.

391
00:16:22,182 --> 00:16:23,462
I have the right to buy stuff.

392
00:16:23,742 --> 00:16:24,982
I can shop as long as I want.

393
00:16:26,022 --> 00:16:26,942
I'm the boss.

394
00:16:26,942 --> 00:16:27,982
I have the right
not to sell things to you.

395
00:16:31,382 --> 00:16:31,942
Get out.

396
00:16:32,422 --> 00:16:33,022
Get out.

397
00:16:33,022 --> 00:16:34,022
No.

398
00:16:34,022 --> 00:16:35,302
You're not welcomed here.

399
00:16:36,222 --> 00:16:37,462
Stop pulling me.

400
00:16:44,182 --> 00:16:44,982
Are you alright?

401
00:16:50,462 --> 00:16:50,982
Dad.

402
00:16:52,462 --> 00:16:53,382
What are you doing?

403
00:16:56,622 --> 00:16:58,302
Hello, Sir, I'm Ji Junxing.

404
00:17:01,142 --> 00:17:02,382
You're screwed.

405
00:17:27,462 --> 00:17:29,582
The kid from Ji Family came
all the way here.

406
00:17:29,982 --> 00:17:31,142
I'm sure they're on the outs.

407
00:17:35,782 --> 00:17:37,662
That's not a big deal.

408
00:17:38,622 --> 00:17:39,702
Is it possible they know

409
00:17:39,702 --> 00:17:40,862
about the heart?

410
00:17:42,342 --> 00:17:43,102
It's impossible.

411
00:17:43,742 --> 00:17:44,702
Anyway,

412
00:17:44,982 --> 00:17:45,782
let's not talk about it

413
00:17:46,062 --> 00:17:47,102
unless they start it first.

414
00:17:47,102 --> 00:17:48,262
Why would I talk about it?

415
00:17:52,622 --> 00:17:53,542
Lin Xi,

416
00:17:54,102 --> 00:17:55,622
get Junxing a glass of water.

417
00:17:56,222 --> 00:17:57,022
Junxing,

418
00:17:57,022 --> 00:17:57,822
there are food on the table.

419
00:17:57,822 --> 00:17:59,062
Help yourself.

420
00:17:59,062 --> 00:17:59,702
Sure.

421
00:18:17,302 --> 00:18:17,982
Junxing,

422
00:18:17,982 --> 00:18:19,342
try this Kung-Pao Chicken I made.

423
00:18:19,342 --> 00:18:19,982
Thank you, Sir.

424
00:18:19,982 --> 00:18:21,662
This is Stewed Beef Brisket with Tomato.

425
00:18:21,662 --> 00:18:22,222
It goes well with rice.

426
00:18:22,222 --> 00:18:23,222
Thank you, Aunt.

427
00:18:23,222 --> 00:18:24,702
Here, have some soup.

428
00:18:24,702 --> 00:18:25,902
Thank you, Aunt.

429
00:18:25,902 --> 00:18:26,502
That's enough.

430
00:18:29,502 --> 00:18:30,222
Junxing,

431
00:18:30,222 --> 00:18:32,982
are you here to hang out with Lin Xi?

432
00:18:33,942 --> 00:18:35,742
She said you're hospitable

433
00:18:35,742 --> 00:18:36,982
and the view here is wonderful.

434
00:18:37,462 --> 00:18:38,662
So she invited me over.

435
00:18:39,302 --> 00:18:40,302
What a non...

436
00:18:43,542 --> 00:18:44,782
He came all the way here,

437
00:18:44,782 --> 00:18:46,302
you've got to take good care of him.

438
00:18:46,502 --> 00:18:47,262
You hear me?

439
00:18:47,902 --> 00:18:49,142
Yes.

440
00:18:49,662 --> 00:18:51,422
Eat more.

441
00:18:51,422 --> 00:18:52,862
There's more in the pot.

442
00:18:52,862 --> 00:18:53,782
It's all yours.

443
00:18:54,222 --> 00:18:55,102
Thank you.

444
00:19:05,342 --> 00:19:06,142
Junxing,

445
00:19:06,742 --> 00:19:08,142
how is your family doing?

446
00:19:08,782 --> 00:19:09,902
How about your baby brother?

447
00:19:10,902 --> 00:19:12,342
My parents are as busy

448
00:19:12,622 --> 00:19:13,182
as always.

449
00:19:13,502 --> 00:19:14,662
My baby brother is quite well.

450
00:19:14,942 --> 00:19:16,382
He's just turned 11 recently.

451
00:19:17,142 --> 00:19:17,582
11?

452
00:19:17,582 --> 00:19:18,662
He's already 11?

453
00:19:20,022 --> 00:19:20,662
Well,

454
00:19:20,662 --> 00:19:23,022
do you have any photos or videos of him?

455
00:19:23,022 --> 00:19:23,822
Yes, I do.

456
00:19:25,662 --> 00:19:26,662
He's turned 11.

457
00:19:27,742 --> 00:19:29,262
This is my brother's birthday video.

458
00:19:33,142 --> 00:19:34,262
This little brat.

459
00:19:35,382 --> 00:19:36,182
He looks fine.

460
00:19:36,182 --> 00:19:37,542
Look how he ate it.

461
00:19:38,022 --> 00:19:39,302
I'm sure he's a big eater.

462
00:19:39,782 --> 00:19:40,862
This is my brother's photo album.

463
00:19:40,862 --> 00:19:41,502
You can poke around it.

464
00:19:43,382 --> 00:19:43,982
Can we?

465
00:19:43,982 --> 00:19:44,542
Sure.

466
00:19:46,782 --> 00:19:47,662
Look, look.

467
00:19:50,142 --> 00:19:51,342
This kid is very mischievous.

468
00:19:51,342 --> 00:19:52,262
Look at his mouth.

469
00:19:54,462 --> 00:19:55,942
What did you do to my dad?

470
00:19:55,942 --> 00:19:57,302
Why does he care about your brother?

471
00:19:59,542 --> 00:20:00,342
Look, look.

472
00:20:01,662 --> 00:20:02,982
This is good.

473
00:20:03,502 --> 00:20:04,062
That's great.

474
00:20:05,262 --> 00:20:06,622
Why do you care so much about him?

475
00:20:06,622 --> 00:20:07,542
Let's eat.

476
00:20:10,622 --> 00:20:11,062
Right.

477
00:20:11,582 --> 00:20:13,222
Let's eat.

478
00:20:15,382 --> 00:20:17,102
Junxing, do you play basketball?

479
00:20:17,102 --> 00:20:17,502
I do.

480
00:20:17,782 --> 00:20:18,262
Perfect.

481
00:20:18,262 --> 00:20:20,662
Let's play with me after the meal.

482
00:20:20,902 --> 00:20:21,462
Sure.

483
00:20:21,942 --> 00:20:22,582
Eat up.

484
00:20:22,582 --> 00:20:23,182
Okay.

485
00:20:24,582 --> 00:20:25,542
Eat more.

486
00:20:26,222 --> 00:20:27,662
Don't just eat rice,
have some vegetables.

487
00:20:27,662 --> 00:20:28,302
Sure.

488
00:20:28,782 --> 00:20:30,422
Come, let me take a photo for you.

489
00:20:30,542 --> 00:20:31,102
Okay.

490
00:20:31,702 --> 00:20:32,742
Come, Lin Xi.

491
00:20:33,782 --> 00:20:34,782
You'll stand in the centre.

492
00:20:35,622 --> 00:20:36,982
Lin Xi, move aside.

493
00:20:36,982 --> 00:20:38,342
You're blocking Junxing.

494
00:20:38,342 --> 00:20:38,942
Quick.

495
00:20:39,822 --> 00:20:41,422
No, what's wrong
with her standing in the centre?

496
00:20:41,422 --> 00:20:42,582
She can't block us.

497
00:20:42,582 --> 00:20:44,342
It doesn't look nice
to stand in the centre.

498
00:20:44,702 --> 00:20:45,102
Move aside.

499
00:20:45,102 --> 00:20:45,742
Mom.

500
00:20:45,982 --> 00:20:46,542
Quick.

501
00:20:46,542 --> 00:20:47,622
I'm not taking it.

502
00:20:49,862 --> 00:20:50,582
Geez, this kid.

503
00:20:50,582 --> 00:20:51,542
I'll take it for you, come.

504
00:20:53,422 --> 00:20:54,222
Look here.

505
00:20:54,462 --> 00:20:55,502
One more shot.

506
00:20:57,182 --> 00:20:58,182
Okay.

507
00:20:59,022 --> 00:21:00,502
This is kind of courtesy first,
violence after.

508
00:21:00,502 --> 00:21:01,422
Bring it on.

509
00:21:02,502 --> 00:21:03,262
Lin Xi, come here.

510
00:21:03,262 --> 00:21:04,342
Hold the coat for me, come.

511
00:21:07,502 --> 00:21:07,942
I have to warm up.

512
00:21:07,942 --> 00:21:08,422
Thank you.

513
00:21:09,262 --> 00:21:10,182
It looks good.

514
00:21:10,182 --> 00:21:11,222
Great.

515
00:21:12,462 --> 00:21:13,142
Ji Junxing,

516
00:21:13,502 --> 00:21:14,662
do you know what the best feature

517
00:21:14,662 --> 00:21:15,302
of a hippo is?

518
00:21:15,542 --> 00:21:16,902
Are you saying that I'm thick-skinned?

519
00:21:16,902 --> 00:21:18,422
So you do have self-knowledge.

520
00:21:18,422 --> 00:21:18,942
You've had a meal.

521
00:21:18,942 --> 00:21:20,062
Now, you're playing basketball with him.

522
00:21:20,062 --> 00:21:21,462
It's hard to reject him.

523
00:21:21,462 --> 00:21:22,582
He favors me.

524
00:21:25,102 --> 00:21:26,422
My dad hasn't played it for two years.

525
00:21:26,422 --> 00:21:27,862
Go easy on him.

526
00:21:28,302 --> 00:21:29,062
Understood.

527
00:21:29,422 --> 00:21:30,302
Like an exhibition game.

528
00:21:38,342 --> 00:21:39,182
Sir, let's begin.

529
00:21:39,182 --> 00:21:40,062
Okay, bring it on.

530
00:21:52,342 --> 00:21:53,382
What's wrong, sir?

531
00:22:03,782 --> 00:22:05,662
Junxing, you can do it, Junxing.

532
00:22:06,782 --> 00:22:08,982
Keep it up, Dad.

533
00:22:20,782 --> 00:22:21,662
For you.

534
00:22:30,942 --> 00:22:32,262
It's unnecessary to pull my punches.

535
00:22:32,862 --> 00:22:34,142
I think you did it on purpose.

536
00:22:35,422 --> 00:22:36,422
Do you have a problem?

537
00:22:37,302 --> 00:22:38,062
Dad,

538
00:22:38,422 --> 00:22:39,662
he said it's no fun
to compete with you alone.

539
00:22:39,662 --> 00:22:40,582
He wants to compete with two persons.

540
00:22:41,462 --> 00:22:42,342
Okay, no problem.

541
00:22:42,342 --> 00:22:43,462
Have a sip of water.

542
00:22:43,462 --> 00:22:44,622
Lin Xi will join in the game.

543
00:22:44,622 --> 00:22:45,502
Okay.

544
00:22:49,822 --> 00:22:51,142
Come, let's start.

545
00:22:51,662 --> 00:22:52,462
How dare you prank me?

546
00:22:52,462 --> 00:22:53,382
I'll crush you.

547
00:22:54,022 --> 00:22:55,342
Come, dribble past him.

548
00:22:56,662 --> 00:22:58,222
Dad, come over here!

549
00:22:58,542 --> 00:22:59,462
Coming.

550
00:22:59,462 --> 00:23:00,342
I got you!

551
00:23:08,222 --> 00:23:09,302
How can you do this?

552
00:23:13,382 --> 00:23:14,182
Dribble past him.

553
00:23:15,822 --> 00:23:17,022
Dad, look at him.

554
00:23:17,022 --> 00:23:17,902
Coming.

555
00:23:17,902 --> 00:23:18,982
Understood, got you!

556
00:23:19,302 --> 00:23:19,782
It's a foul.

557
00:23:19,782 --> 00:23:21,382
You two cheated.

558
00:23:23,582 --> 00:23:25,102
This is how our family plays basketball.

559
00:23:25,102 --> 00:23:26,022
You know?

560
00:23:26,022 --> 00:23:26,502
Come.

561
00:23:26,502 --> 00:23:27,262
Let's continue.

562
00:23:30,022 --> 00:23:30,622
Okay, I'm fine.

563
00:23:30,622 --> 00:23:31,462
Wipe the sweat off.

564
00:23:31,462 --> 00:23:32,622
Lin Xi, you guys enjoy.

565
00:23:32,622 --> 00:23:33,942
Your mom and I are leaving.

566
00:23:34,622 --> 00:23:36,902
We're going home
to prepare dinner for Junxing.

567
00:23:36,902 --> 00:23:37,502
Thank you, Aunt.

568
00:23:37,502 --> 00:23:38,062
You guys have fun.

569
00:23:39,062 --> 00:23:39,742
We'll get going.

570
00:23:40,102 --> 00:23:41,142
See you later.

571
00:23:41,142 --> 00:23:42,182
Thank you, Aunt.

572
00:23:46,622 --> 00:23:47,942
It's been a long time since I saw

573
00:23:47,942 --> 00:23:49,062
my parents laugh so merrily.

574
00:23:52,702 --> 00:23:54,622
I've contributed to this great show.

575
00:23:55,942 --> 00:23:57,542
Can you tell me why you're mad?

576
00:24:18,222 --> 00:24:19,542
Are you not going to tell me?

577
00:24:23,102 --> 00:24:24,022
I heard

578
00:24:24,542 --> 00:24:25,942
you told Song Linxue

579
00:24:26,622 --> 00:24:27,582
that you hated me.

580
00:24:28,942 --> 00:24:30,182
That wasn't true.

581
00:24:31,222 --> 00:24:32,542
I heard it myself.

582
00:24:32,542 --> 00:24:33,782
That was just part of it.

583
00:24:37,542 --> 00:24:38,302
You're right.

584
00:24:39,422 --> 00:24:40,782
I hate Lin Xi.

585
00:24:41,622 --> 00:24:44,142
But because of her personality,

586
00:24:44,702 --> 00:24:45,742
she took risk to climb

587
00:24:45,742 --> 00:24:47,022
a tree to rescue a cat.

588
00:24:47,582 --> 00:24:49,382
She joined the game and fought

589
00:24:49,742 --> 00:24:50,742
to the last for the honor

590
00:24:51,222 --> 00:24:52,142
of the class.

591
00:24:53,062 --> 00:24:53,902
She's sincere,

592
00:24:54,462 --> 00:24:55,142
kind,

593
00:24:55,622 --> 00:24:56,222
passionate.

594
00:24:57,342 --> 00:24:59,342
Making a loner like me think

595
00:25:00,302 --> 00:25:02,142
it's a great thing to make friends

596
00:25:02,902 --> 00:25:04,502
with her.

597
00:25:04,742 --> 00:25:05,622
That's how it is.

598
00:25:08,022 --> 00:25:08,742
Is that true?

599
00:25:09,262 --> 00:25:09,902
It is.

600
00:25:13,742 --> 00:25:14,582
Do you believe me?

601
00:25:22,142 --> 00:25:23,142
I believe you.

602
00:25:33,102 --> 00:25:34,862
Then, there's one thing
I'd like to ask you.

603
00:25:35,702 --> 00:25:37,142
You wanted to make friends with me

604
00:25:38,062 --> 00:25:39,302
just because I got

605
00:25:39,302 --> 00:25:40,342
your brother's heart?

606
00:25:41,342 --> 00:25:42,462
You already knew it?

607
00:25:42,862 --> 00:25:44,102
Did Aunt tell you that?

608
00:25:48,662 --> 00:25:49,862
So it really is the case.

609
00:25:51,942 --> 00:25:54,182
I'm sorry to disappoint you.

610
00:25:55,782 --> 00:25:56,702
What do you mean?

611
00:25:57,622 --> 00:25:59,102
I don't have your brother's heart.

612
00:26:01,222 --> 00:26:02,222
It's with my baby brother.

613
00:26:16,102 --> 00:26:17,062
Long time no see.

614
00:26:17,702 --> 00:26:18,662
How are you doing?

615
00:26:19,422 --> 00:26:20,502
You've got the wrong person.

616
00:26:21,182 --> 00:26:22,222
You're Ji Junxing.

617
00:26:22,702 --> 00:26:23,302
Yes.

618
00:26:23,902 --> 00:26:24,822
Then, I'm right.

619
00:26:31,902 --> 00:26:32,662
What are you doing?

620
00:26:33,062 --> 00:26:34,102
Do I know you?

621
00:26:38,142 --> 00:26:39,622
Do you like me?

622
00:26:39,942 --> 00:26:40,622
No.

623
00:26:44,862 --> 00:26:45,742
I love you.

624
00:26:55,142 --> 00:26:57,062
How couldn't I realize that?

625
00:26:58,182 --> 00:27:00,422
Ji Junxing doesn't look
like he's got a heart problem.

626
00:27:01,782 --> 00:27:03,702
You must be out of your mind.

627
00:27:14,222 --> 00:27:14,982
Hello?

628
00:27:14,982 --> 00:27:15,942
Lin Xi, Lin Xi.

629
00:27:15,942 --> 00:27:17,262
We got in a fight yesterday.

630
00:27:17,262 --> 00:27:17,982
Isn't it drastic?

631
00:27:18,182 --> 00:27:19,582
You didn't witness the situation.

632
00:27:19,822 --> 00:27:21,862
It was a chaos.

633
00:27:21,862 --> 00:27:22,782
At the crucial moment,

634
00:27:22,782 --> 00:27:24,262
I released a secret weapon

635
00:27:24,262 --> 00:27:25,422
and turned things around.

636
00:27:25,422 --> 00:27:26,262
Guess what it was.

637
00:27:26,582 --> 00:27:27,662
A huge Oolong (misunderstanding).

638
00:27:28,582 --> 00:27:29,702
It was a big bottle of Cola.

639
00:27:29,702 --> 00:27:31,142
Oolong is not destructive.

640
00:27:31,622 --> 00:27:34,342
It has high lethality, okay?

641
00:27:34,662 --> 00:27:36,542
I've shamed myself.

642
00:27:38,902 --> 00:27:40,062
Sir, it hurts!

643
00:27:41,302 --> 00:27:41,982
It hurts!

644
00:27:42,982 --> 00:27:43,502
It hurts!

645
00:27:43,502 --> 00:27:45,102
It's alright, bear with me.

646
00:27:46,382 --> 00:27:48,222
Lin Xi, am I having
auditory hallucination?

647
00:27:48,222 --> 00:27:49,022
Easy.

648
00:27:49,182 --> 00:27:49,742
I thought

649
00:27:49,742 --> 00:27:51,142
I heard Ji Junxing's voices.

650
00:27:51,822 --> 00:27:52,902
You're not wrong.

651
00:27:53,502 --> 00:27:54,782
He's at my place now.

652
00:27:55,742 --> 00:27:57,062
It's a long story.

653
00:27:57,502 --> 00:27:58,822
I'll explain to you later.

654
00:28:02,822 --> 00:28:03,502
Again.

655
00:28:39,822 --> 00:28:43,782
Second set of primary school
broadcast exercise,

656
00:28:44,462 --> 00:28:46,622
Flying Eagle.

657
00:28:54,142 --> 00:28:55,382
Hello, what do you want?

658
00:28:55,702 --> 00:28:57,142
Good morning, Miamian.

659
00:28:57,142 --> 00:28:58,342
I'm downstairs.

660
00:29:00,782 --> 00:29:02,382
Get ready, go.

661
00:29:02,782 --> 00:29:06,662
One, two, three, four,
five, six, seven, eight.

662
00:29:06,662 --> 00:29:09,742
Two, two, three, four, five, six...

663
00:29:09,742 --> 00:29:10,542
Stretching exercises.

664
00:29:10,542 --> 00:29:11,462
Are you insane?

665
00:29:11,462 --> 00:29:12,342
Why are you so excited

666
00:29:12,342 --> 00:29:13,022
early in the morning?

667
00:29:13,022 --> 00:29:14,382
Are you here to do square dance with me?

668
00:29:14,382 --> 00:29:15,062
No.

669
00:29:15,302 --> 00:29:16,622
I want to ask you a math question.

670
00:29:16,942 --> 00:29:18,262
A math question?

671
00:29:18,582 --> 00:29:19,062
Did you come

672
00:29:19,062 --> 00:29:20,342
all the way here to humiliate me?

673
00:29:20,822 --> 00:29:21,422
No.

674
00:29:21,422 --> 00:29:22,102
It's very simple.

675
00:29:22,102 --> 00:29:22,822
Take a look.

676
00:29:25,662 --> 00:29:26,902
I'm certain that you're humiliating me.

677
00:29:27,942 --> 00:29:29,102
You didn't look at it closely.

678
00:29:38,662 --> 00:29:39,142
Look.

679
00:29:39,662 --> 00:29:40,222
No.

680
00:29:40,862 --> 00:29:42,942
We've been struck by math questions
at school everyday.

681
00:29:42,942 --> 00:29:43,942
I finally get to take a break.

682
00:29:43,942 --> 00:29:45,102
I just want to have a good sleep.

683
00:29:45,102 --> 00:29:46,502
Why bother sleeping?

684
00:29:46,502 --> 00:29:47,822
There's no need to sleep long
while we're alive.

685
00:29:47,822 --> 00:29:49,142
We'll have a long sleep when we die.

686
00:29:49,582 --> 00:29:50,302
You curse me.

687
00:29:51,262 --> 00:29:51,822
No.

688
00:29:52,102 --> 00:29:53,062
What I mean is

689
00:29:53,462 --> 00:29:54,302
as it's a beautiful day,

690
00:29:54,302 --> 00:29:55,382
why don't we go out and have fun?

691
00:29:55,942 --> 00:29:56,502
No.

692
00:29:56,502 --> 00:29:57,782
It's no fun hanging out with you.

693
00:29:57,782 --> 00:29:58,742
Lin Xi and the others are
not here either.

694
00:29:58,742 --> 00:29:59,382
It's boring.

695
00:30:02,982 --> 00:30:04,142
Let's go find them.

696
00:30:12,382 --> 00:30:13,542
Why do I feel like

697
00:30:13,822 --> 00:30:15,062
we're eloping?

698
00:30:15,902 --> 00:30:16,822
You've thought too much.

699
00:30:16,822 --> 00:30:18,102
There's no way we'll elope.

700
00:30:18,102 --> 00:30:19,302
But I might tear you apart.
[Elope and tear apart sound similar in Chinese]

701
00:30:30,942 --> 00:30:31,622
What are you doing?

702
00:30:33,462 --> 00:30:34,342
I feel dizzy.

703
00:30:34,742 --> 00:30:36,862
Maybe I haven't recovered
from concussion.

704
00:30:38,182 --> 00:30:40,142
Just say it if you want the neck pillow.

705
00:30:40,142 --> 00:30:41,262
Quit dilly-dallying.

706
00:30:58,062 --> 00:30:59,462
How long will you stay here this time?

707
00:30:59,862 --> 00:31:01,582
Until the end of this winter break.

708
00:31:02,662 --> 00:31:03,182
Here you go.

709
00:31:03,502 --> 00:31:04,542
Put it on my dad.

710
00:31:04,542 --> 00:31:04,942
Okay.

711
00:31:04,942 --> 00:31:05,702
Thank you, Mr. Guang.

712
00:31:08,622 --> 00:31:09,382
Thank you.

713
00:31:12,102 --> 00:31:12,782
Thank you.

714
00:31:18,742 --> 00:31:20,702
The orthopedic massage
your dad gave me last night

715
00:31:20,902 --> 00:31:22,062
got a strong delayed effect.

716
00:31:24,022 --> 00:31:24,622
Let me do it.

717
00:31:28,702 --> 00:31:29,542
Quickly eat it.

718
00:31:29,542 --> 00:31:30,622
I'll send you off after this.

719
00:31:31,542 --> 00:31:32,062
Where to?

720
00:31:32,902 --> 00:31:33,542
The train station.

721
00:31:35,022 --> 00:31:36,182
You're eager to send me away.

722
00:31:36,862 --> 00:31:38,382
It was just a misunderstanding.

723
00:31:38,702 --> 00:31:39,542
I don't feel awkward.

724
00:31:39,542 --> 00:31:40,422
Why would you?

725
00:31:43,862 --> 00:31:45,022
You don't feel awkward.

726
00:31:45,022 --> 00:31:45,942
But I do.

727
00:31:51,822 --> 00:31:52,342
Yes.

728
00:31:53,142 --> 00:31:54,422
I've got the wrong person.

729
00:31:54,742 --> 00:31:56,622
I was dying to make friends with you.

730
00:31:56,782 --> 00:31:57,622
Sorry.

731
00:31:57,982 --> 00:31:58,982
I apologize.

732
00:31:59,902 --> 00:32:02,102
So just eat up.

733
00:32:02,982 --> 00:32:03,782
If you don't leave,

734
00:32:04,142 --> 00:32:05,422
I'll suffer from heart attack.

735
00:32:13,742 --> 00:32:15,302
I don't want you to apologize.

736
00:32:16,822 --> 00:32:17,902
I just want to know

737
00:32:18,302 --> 00:32:19,822
if you'll still make friends with me

738
00:32:21,262 --> 00:32:22,662
if it wasn't for the heart.

739
00:32:29,182 --> 00:32:30,182
If it wasn't for that,

740
00:32:30,902 --> 00:32:32,382
I wouldn't have been transferred there.

741
00:32:33,102 --> 00:32:34,022
And I wouldn't have known you.

742
00:32:37,462 --> 00:32:38,862
If that heart was

743
00:32:38,862 --> 00:32:39,662
with Qin Kai,

744
00:32:39,662 --> 00:32:40,382
or Xie Ang

745
00:32:40,622 --> 00:32:42,102
or a random guy,

746
00:32:42,542 --> 00:32:43,662
would you still treat them well?

747
00:32:46,142 --> 00:32:47,302
There's no such thing as ifs.

748
00:32:49,102 --> 00:32:50,182
I just want to know

749
00:32:50,782 --> 00:32:51,382
if I am

750
00:32:51,382 --> 00:32:52,622
a substitute for your brother.

751
00:32:55,702 --> 00:32:56,542
Lin Xi.

752
00:32:57,222 --> 00:32:57,902
Xing.

753
00:32:57,902 --> 00:32:58,862
I miss you so much.

754
00:32:58,862 --> 00:33:00,062
Why are you here?

755
00:33:00,142 --> 00:33:01,302
I miss you.

756
00:33:01,302 --> 00:33:01,862
It's been a long time.

757
00:33:01,862 --> 00:33:02,502
I've been occupied with extra lessons.

758
00:33:02,502 --> 00:33:03,182
So I came to take a break.

759
00:33:03,182 --> 00:33:04,382
Why didn't you tell me you're coming?

760
00:33:04,382 --> 00:33:05,302
You're mean.

761
00:33:05,302 --> 00:33:06,542
You came to have fun

762
00:33:06,542 --> 00:33:07,742
without inviting me.

763
00:33:08,822 --> 00:33:09,662
The egg tastes good.

764
00:33:11,662 --> 00:33:12,462
I just peeled it.

765
00:33:12,462 --> 00:33:13,582
You came at the right time.

766
00:33:13,902 --> 00:33:14,582
Sorry.

767
00:33:14,582 --> 00:33:15,662
Did I interrupt you guys?

768
00:33:15,982 --> 00:33:16,542
No.

769
00:33:16,542 --> 00:33:17,422
He's leaving soon.

770
00:33:21,422 --> 00:33:22,382
Don't do that.

771
00:33:22,622 --> 00:33:23,302
We just arrived.

772
00:33:23,302 --> 00:33:23,902
Stay a little longer.

773
00:33:23,902 --> 00:33:25,062
It's just one more day.

774
00:33:25,942 --> 00:33:26,662
Yes, right.

775
00:33:29,662 --> 00:33:30,462
I can't help it.

776
00:33:30,462 --> 00:33:31,262
They don't let me go.

777
00:33:32,222 --> 00:33:32,862
It's Heaven's will.

778
00:33:42,422 --> 00:33:43,702
We're going downhill, Mianmian.

779
00:33:49,662 --> 00:33:51,102
What grudge do you have
against each other?

780
00:33:51,102 --> 00:33:52,502
It's still not settled
even when you came to her home.

781
00:33:53,262 --> 00:33:54,182
You don't understand.

782
00:33:54,542 --> 00:33:55,622
Let me analyse it for you.

783
00:33:55,942 --> 00:33:57,782
Girls' mindsets are very complicated.

784
00:33:57,782 --> 00:33:58,702
Take my mom as an example.

785
00:33:58,702 --> 00:33:59,742
She was mad because of A.

786
00:33:59,742 --> 00:34:00,582
So I coaxed her.

787
00:34:00,582 --> 00:34:01,622
And she asked me why she got mad.

788
00:34:01,622 --> 00:34:02,622
And I said I didn't know.

789
00:34:02,622 --> 00:34:03,142
Well,

790
00:34:03,142 --> 00:34:04,302
her anger intensified and reached B.

791
00:34:04,582 --> 00:34:06,102
Now, she got mad

792
00:34:06,102 --> 00:34:07,222
because you didn't know

793
00:34:07,222 --> 00:34:08,022
why she was mad.

794
00:34:09,582 --> 00:34:10,622
It's indeed complicated.

795
00:34:10,822 --> 00:34:12,142
Then, when you found out B

796
00:34:12,142 --> 00:34:13,182
and coaxed her with A.

797
00:34:13,182 --> 00:34:13,902
Sorry,

798
00:34:13,902 --> 00:34:15,142
she has reached C.

799
00:34:15,422 --> 00:34:15,942
At this moment,

800
00:34:15,942 --> 00:34:16,942
she won't listen to you.

801
00:34:16,942 --> 00:34:17,382
If you don't coax her,

802
00:34:17,382 --> 00:34:18,302
she won't forgive you.

803
00:34:18,582 --> 00:34:19,742
Everything I do is wrong.

804
00:34:20,182 --> 00:34:21,902
Buddy, as a friendly reminder,

805
00:34:21,902 --> 00:34:22,982
what stage are you guys in now?

806
00:34:24,062 --> 00:34:25,702
That was our previous stage.

807
00:34:25,942 --> 00:34:27,982
We're in a new situation now.

808
00:34:28,982 --> 00:34:29,782
D?

809
00:34:30,822 --> 00:34:32,982
You're on your own, Buddy.

810
00:34:36,782 --> 00:34:38,422
You're no longer related to Ji Junxing?

811
00:34:39,142 --> 00:34:40,142
You can't put it this way.

812
00:34:40,342 --> 00:34:40,982
He's the brother

813
00:34:40,982 --> 00:34:42,462
of my brother's heart recipient.

814
00:34:43,702 --> 00:34:45,662
It sounds complicated.

815
00:34:46,422 --> 00:34:47,862
Do you know this feeling?

816
00:34:48,222 --> 00:34:49,582
They used to be a whole.

817
00:34:49,982 --> 00:34:51,702
Now that they're suddenly separated

818
00:34:51,702 --> 00:34:53,262
like an egg and its eggshell.

819
00:34:54,022 --> 00:34:55,822
I worked so hard to know the eggshell

820
00:34:56,102 --> 00:34:58,422
but I found that I knew nothing
about the egg.

821
00:34:59,182 --> 00:35:00,782
Ji Junxing is that egg.

822
00:35:01,022 --> 00:35:01,822
Who is he?

823
00:35:02,102 --> 00:35:03,462
What does he mean to me?

824
00:35:04,142 --> 00:35:05,662
I don't seem to know him.

825
00:35:06,142 --> 00:35:07,142
Or I should say

826
00:35:07,342 --> 00:35:08,702
I never knew him.

827
00:35:09,342 --> 00:35:10,422
Come to think of it.

828
00:35:10,422 --> 00:35:11,742
I feel bad for the egg.

829
00:35:12,462 --> 00:35:13,462
You mean Ji Junxing?

830
00:35:13,462 --> 00:35:14,262
Yes.

831
00:35:14,262 --> 00:35:15,622
After all, he sincerely wanted

832
00:35:15,622 --> 00:35:16,942
to be friends with you.

833
00:35:26,982 --> 00:35:28,702
Sunshine, light breeze,

834
00:35:28,702 --> 00:35:30,062
clear lake water,

835
00:35:30,062 --> 00:35:31,022
it's perfect.

836
00:35:33,062 --> 00:35:34,622
This is not having fun.

837
00:35:34,622 --> 00:35:35,902
It's clearly toying with me.

838
00:35:35,902 --> 00:35:36,742
What did you say?

839
00:35:37,462 --> 00:35:38,862
I said I feel very happy.

840
00:35:38,862 --> 00:35:39,622
I know right.

841
00:35:39,622 --> 00:35:40,742
I'm happy too.

842
00:35:41,422 --> 00:35:42,662
Can you push harder?

843
00:36:18,302 --> 00:36:19,062
- I...
- I...

844
00:36:23,022 --> 00:36:24,062
Let me talk first.

845
00:36:30,142 --> 00:36:31,382
Actually, it's nothing special.

846
00:36:32,902 --> 00:36:33,662
I just

847
00:36:35,062 --> 00:36:38,022
want to say sorry.

848
00:36:39,662 --> 00:36:40,582
Back then,

849
00:36:41,502 --> 00:36:43,062
I've treated you
as an epitome of my brother.

850
00:36:45,702 --> 00:36:46,422
I know.

851
00:36:47,822 --> 00:36:48,982
You once asked me

852
00:36:49,622 --> 00:36:51,102
if I would be nice to the other guy

853
00:36:51,422 --> 00:36:52,662
if he had the heart.

854
00:36:53,902 --> 00:36:54,902
The answer is

855
00:36:56,062 --> 00:36:56,582
yes.

856
00:36:59,542 --> 00:37:02,342
Besides, we wouldn't have
been tablemates

857
00:37:03,422 --> 00:37:05,342
and there wouldn't be East Gate Squad.

858
00:37:06,102 --> 00:37:08,942
Those happy and awkward matters

859
00:37:10,062 --> 00:37:11,022
wouldn't have happened.

860
00:37:12,822 --> 00:37:13,622
As such,

861
00:37:16,342 --> 00:37:17,542
just pretend it never happened.

862
00:37:23,702 --> 00:37:25,342
I was too selfish back then.

863
00:37:26,622 --> 00:37:28,982
If you want to go back
to what it used to be,

864
00:37:30,222 --> 00:37:30,982
I'll accept it.

865
00:37:32,542 --> 00:37:33,422
It's not that.

866
00:37:34,102 --> 00:37:34,862
But starting everything over.

867
00:37:36,422 --> 00:37:37,342
What do you mean?

868
00:37:37,982 --> 00:37:39,382
Let's get acquainted all over again.

869
00:37:41,022 --> 00:37:42,622
Reacquaint the real Ji Junxing.

870
00:37:43,582 --> 00:37:45,422
Instead of the recipient
of your brother's heart

871
00:37:46,142 --> 00:37:47,142
or anyone else.

872
00:37:48,062 --> 00:37:49,022
I mean me myself.

873
00:37:50,942 --> 00:37:51,502
Hello.

874
00:37:51,862 --> 00:37:52,862
Let me introduce myself.

875
00:37:53,702 --> 00:37:54,742
My name is Ji Junxing.

876
00:38:03,902 --> 00:38:04,862
Hello, Ji.

877
00:38:05,462 --> 00:38:06,262
I am Lin Xi.

878
00:38:21,502 --> 00:38:22,182
You're back.

879
00:38:23,462 --> 00:38:24,862
All your friends have gone back?

880
00:38:25,262 --> 00:38:25,782
They have.

881
00:38:30,862 --> 00:38:31,862
Have you eaten yet?

882
00:38:34,222 --> 00:38:34,822
I have.

883
00:38:44,902 --> 00:38:46,182
You're too old

884
00:38:46,702 --> 00:38:47,782
to be so clingy.

885
00:38:50,022 --> 00:38:51,142
I just want to say

886
00:38:52,622 --> 00:38:53,422
Mom,

887
00:38:55,622 --> 00:38:56,622
I love you so much.

888
00:39:01,862 --> 00:39:02,902
I know.

889
00:39:05,342 --> 00:39:06,062
What's the matter?

890
00:39:06,982 --> 00:39:08,022
Nothing.

891
00:39:10,902 --> 00:39:12,222
