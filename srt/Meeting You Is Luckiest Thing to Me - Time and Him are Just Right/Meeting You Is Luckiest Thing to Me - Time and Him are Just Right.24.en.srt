Not at all.

37
00:03:20,520 --> 00:03:21,600
Do you want to take a nap?

38
00:03:24,920 --> 00:03:26,280
I feel a little hungry.

40
00:03:47,920 --> 00:03:49,000
Do you like this place?

41
00:03:52,720 --> 00:03:53,480
I like it a lot.

42
00:03:54,600 --> 00:03:56,400
It's still bright in the wee hours.

43

00:03:59,680 --> 00:04:00,880
I know

46
00:04:01,160 --> 00:04:01,760
there are still people

47
00:04:01,760 --> 00:04:03,000
working with you so late at night.

48
00:04:03,400 --> 00:04:04,640
All my hard work

49
00:04:05,040 --> 00:04:05,840
is nothing much.

50
00:04:07,120 --> 00:04:08,240
I like this place too.

51
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:09,760
This is the place

52
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:12,480
where I get to see the dreams
that only exist

53
00:04:12,480 --> 00:04:13,880
in hypothesis and plans

54
00:04:14,360 --> 00:04:15,720
being realized slowly.

55
00:04:16,560 --> 00:04:17,720
It makes me think

56
00:04:18,280 --> 00:04:19,520
that we will be rewarded

57
00:04:19,520 --> 00:04:21,080
as long as we do our best

58
00:04:21,880 --> 00:04:23,080
to pursue our dreams at every stage.

59
00:04:26,360 --> 00:04:27,680
What if we were to lose?

60
00:04:28,400 --> 00:04:29,680
Have you thought about that?

61
00:04:29,960 --> 00:04:30,920
Will you be afraid?

62
00:04:33,360 --> 00:04:34,200
I had.

63
00:04:34,920 --> 00:04:35,840
I was afraid.

64
00:04:37,080 --> 00:04:38,400
However, I figured it out soon.

65
00:04:38,760 --> 00:04:39,520
What did you figure out?

66
00:05:07,160 --> 00:05:08,200
Look at this paper plane.

67
00:05:08,520 --> 00:05:09,760
I folded it

68
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:11,040
and threw it out.

69
00:05:11,360 --> 00:05:12,640
Its aerodynamics and power

70
00:05:12,640 --> 00:05:14,040
were both within my calculation.

71
00:05:14,680 --> 00:05:15,960
As for the direction
that it's going to fly in,

72
00:05:17,040 --> 00:05:18,000
I'll let the wind decide.

73
00:05:21,640 --> 00:05:22,560
You are right.

74
00:05:23,280 --> 00:05:24,640
I believe in our capabilities

75
00:05:24,960 --> 00:05:27,040
and the judgment of the judges.

76
00:05:27,400 --> 00:05:29,960
If they can't see
who is the original creator

77
00:05:29,960 --> 00:05:31,120
and who plagiarized,

78
00:05:31,560 --> 00:05:32,680
there's no point in participating

79
00:05:32,680 --> 00:05:33,920
in this competition.

80
00:05:41,600 --> 00:05:43,080
Doing what we have to

81
00:05:43,920 --> 00:05:45,160
is the most important thing.

82
00:05:50,920 --> 00:05:51,680
What's wrong?

83
00:05:52,520 --> 00:05:53,360
Nothing.

84
00:05:54,080 --> 00:05:55,000
I think

85
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:58,280
I like you more.

86
00:05:59,520 --> 00:06:01,000
Why can't I feel that?

87
00:06:08,640 --> 00:06:09,320
What about now?

88
00:06:10,360 --> 00:06:12,240
I feel just a little bit.

89
00:06:13,200 --> 00:06:14,200
Can you give me a bit more?

90
00:06:18,400 --> 00:06:20,600
Love needs to go on for a long time.

91
00:06:20,840 --> 00:06:21,880
Feel it slowly.

92
00:06:25,480 --> 00:06:26,320

96

99
00:07:26,520 --> 00:07:27,120
Okay.

100
00:07:27,680 --> 00:07:28,440
I understand.

101
00:07:30,760 --> 00:07:31,400
Thank you.

102
00:07:33,720 --> 00:07:34,600
How is it?

103
00:07:38,680 --> 00:07:39,680

106

107

You are another step closer to success.

00:08:31,560 --> 00:08:32,280
Me too.

127
00:08:32,960 --> 00:08:33,560

139
00:08:52,200 --> 00:08:53,200
Where are you?

140
00:08:53,200 --> 00:08:54,520
Where are you guys?

141
00:08:55,440 --> 00:08:56,720
We are in front of
the education building.

142
00:08:56,720 --> 00:08:57,600
Where are you?

143
00:08:58,040 --> 00:08:59,000
I saw you!

144
00:09:00,800 --> 00:09:01,920
She's here.

145

We are only waiting for you.

146

Don't worry.

147
00:09:05,400 --> 00:09:06,600
I won't miss your graduation

148
00:09:06,600 --> 00:09:08,000
even if I have to skip classes.

149
00:09:09,640 --> 00:09:10,200
Here.

150
00:09:10,560 --> 00:09:12,560
Let you feel the power of knowledge.

151
00:09:17,760 --> 00:09:18,720
It looks nice.

152
00:09:18,720 --> 00:09:19,320
It's nice.

153
00:09:21,080 --> 00:09:21,680
It's nice.

154
00:09:21,920 --> 00:09:23,120
It's quite heavy.

155
00:09:23,600 --> 00:09:24,080
How is it?

156
00:09:24,080 --> 00:09:24,920
Do I look like

157
00:09:24,920 --> 00:09:26,120
a graduate now?

158
00:09:26,120 --> 00:09:26,760
- Yes.
- Yes.

159
00:09:27,120 --> 00:09:27,840
Two years later,

160
00:09:27,840 --> 00:09:28,680
you can get it too.

161
00:09:28,920 --> 00:09:29,640
Did you call me here

162
00:09:29,640 --> 00:09:30,960
to make me feel defeated?

163
00:09:32,040 --> 00:09:33,680
You can help us take pictures.

164
00:09:33,680 --> 00:09:34,280
That's right.

165
00:09:34,560 --> 00:09:35,040
Come.

166
00:09:35,040 --> 00:09:36,040
The photographer is here.

167
00:09:36,040 --> 00:09:37,240
Strike a pose!

168

Mianmian. Stand closer.

169
00:09:45,200 --> 00:09:46,200
Everyone!

170
00:09:46,200 --> 00:09:48,200
We have finally graduated today!

171
00:09:48,200 --> 00:09:49,840
Let's take a group photo!

172
00:09:50,640 --> 00:09:52,240
- Come on.
- Come on.

173
00:09:52,240 --> 00:09:53,360
Hurry!

174
00:09:53,360 --> 00:09:56,440
Three! Two! One!

175
00:10:18,320 --> 00:10:19,440
Time passes by quickly.

176
00:10:19,960 --> 00:10:20,960
All of you are graduating

177
00:10:20,960 --> 00:10:22,200
in the blink of an eye.

178
00:10:23,440 --> 00:10:24,240
Indeed.

179
00:10:24,800 --> 00:10:26,520
It felt like yesterday

180
00:10:26,840 --> 00:10:28,560
when we welcomed you with the banner.

181
00:10:33,280 --> 00:10:34,960
What do you plan to do after this?

182
00:10:36,360 --> 00:10:38,080
I plan to "lie flat" for a while

183
00:10:38,080 --> 00:10:39,320
before I enter the working world.

184
00:10:40,280 --> 00:10:41,360
I will remain an entrepreneur.

185
00:10:41,640 --> 00:10:43,640
I will stay at the company I interned.

186
00:10:44,200 --> 00:10:45,240
I'm applying to
become an expatriate staff.

187
00:10:45,240 --> 00:10:46,920
Perhaps I might be overseas next time.

188
00:10:47,640 --> 00:10:49,120
I won't be around next month too.

189
00:10:49,400 --> 00:10:50,000
I received

190
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:51,400
an admission letter
for my Master's degree.

191
00:10:51,760 --> 00:10:53,160
I want to go to England early

192
00:10:53,160 --> 00:10:54,400
to get used to the surroundings.

193
00:10:54,400 --> 00:10:55,120
Not bad.

194
00:10:55,440 --> 00:10:56,600
I'm impressed.

195
00:10:56,600 --> 00:10:58,040
Those who can stay in the ivory tower

196
00:10:58,040 --> 00:10:59,320
are real warriors.

197
00:10:59,920 --> 00:11:01,240
I can't wait

198
00:11:01,240 --> 00:11:02,640
to work and earn money.

199
00:11:03,880 --> 00:11:04,920
I'll be going to Shanghai next week.

200
00:11:06,760 --> 00:11:08,800
Didn't you tell me
that you'll be staying in Jingzhou?

201
00:11:09,040 --> 00:11:11,200
Why did you decide
to go to Shanghai all of a sudden?

202
00:11:11,480 --> 00:11:12,120
I sent my resume

203
00:11:12,120 --> 00:11:13,360
to a famous new media company

204
00:11:13,360 --> 00:11:14,320
previously.

205
00:11:14,320 --> 00:11:15,800
I wanted to try my luck

206
00:11:15,800 --> 00:11:16,960
but I passed.

207
00:11:17,320 --> 00:11:19,200
There's no choice. I'm the chosen one.

208
00:11:20,920 --> 00:11:22,400
Aren't you going to say something?

209
00:11:25,240 --> 00:11:26,360
Shanghai is good.

210
00:11:28,120 --> 00:11:29,240
Take care when you're alone.

211
00:11:35,120 --> 00:11:36,240
I won't be alone.

212
00:11:36,480 --> 00:11:37,760
Many students will be going there.

213
00:11:37,920 --> 00:11:38,960
I remember now.

214
00:11:38,960 --> 00:11:41,840
He Qingyuan who helped us with
the start-up competition previously

215
00:11:42,160 --> 00:11:43,480
is there as well.

216
00:11:52,760 --> 00:11:54,720
I didn't expect the six of us

217
00:11:55,080 --> 00:11:57,240
to drift apart so soon.

218
00:11:57,760 --> 00:11:59,240
I wonder when the next time will be

219
00:11:59,240 --> 00:12:00,840
when we can gather and eat together.

220
00:12:06,360 --> 00:12:07,040
Perhaps

221
00:12:07,040 --> 00:12:08,520
the next time we meet,

222
00:12:08,520 --> 00:12:10,080
we will be "President Ji",

223
00:12:10,560 --> 00:12:11,160
"President Gao",

224
00:12:11,760 --> 00:12:12,520
"Mr. Xie",

225
00:12:13,800 --> 00:12:14,600
"Dr. Chen",

226
00:12:14,600 --> 00:12:16,000
and "Dr. Lin".

227
00:12:18,400 --> 00:12:20,120
Let's have a toast

228
00:12:20,120 --> 00:12:21,280
- for our new lives.
- Cheers.

229
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:22,680
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

230
00:12:23,160 --> 00:12:23,880
Cheers.

231
00:12:24,160 --> 00:12:24,560
Cheers.

232
00:12:24,560 --> 00:12:27,040
All the best.

233
00:12:27,640 --> 00:12:28,600
All the best.

234
00:13:07,080 --> 00:13:08,920
This market analysis report you wrote

235
00:13:08,920 --> 00:13:10,120
is not bad.

236
00:13:10,720 --> 00:13:11,600
Thank you, Mr. Zheng.

237
00:13:12,840 --> 00:13:13,640
Mr. Zheng,

238
00:13:13,880 --> 00:13:15,000
I want to go to England

239
00:13:15,520 --> 00:13:16,600
as an expatriate staff.

240
00:13:18,880 --> 00:13:20,040
Let me think about it.

241
00:13:56,273 --> 00:13:58,173
(Jingzhou Jixing Technology Co. Ltd)

242
00:14:01,640 --> 00:14:02,240
Mr. Ji,

243
00:14:02,240 --> 00:14:03,320
please uncover the plaque.

244
00:14:09,160 --> 00:14:11,440
Jingzhou Jixing Technology Co. Ltd

245
00:14:11,440 --> 00:14:12,400
is officially established.

246
00:14:16,160 --> 00:14:16,720
Mr. Ji,

247
00:14:16,720 --> 00:14:17,840
why do you name the company

248
00:14:17,840 --> 00:14:19,200
Stream in English?

249
00:14:20,960 --> 00:14:23,040
It means a small river, right?

250
00:14:23,240 --> 00:14:23,960
That's right.

251
00:14:23,960 --> 00:14:25,160
That's what it means.

252
00:14:25,720 --> 00:14:26,280
Mr. Ji.

253
00:14:26,280 --> 00:14:27,800
It doesn't sound epic.

254
00:14:29,480 --> 00:14:30,120
Indeed.

255
00:14:30,440 --> 00:14:32,240
We are a stream right now.

256
00:14:32,760 --> 00:14:34,960
Our road ahead
might be full of difficulties.

257
00:14:35,560 --> 00:14:36,480
But I hope

258
00:14:36,800 --> 00:14:37,720
we can gather

259
00:14:37,720 --> 00:14:38,840
everyone's strength in the end

260
00:14:38,840 --> 00:14:40,560
to form a wide river

261
00:14:40,760 --> 00:14:41,760
or even the ocean.

262
00:14:44,200 --> 00:14:44,720
Good!

263
00:14:44,720 --> 00:14:47,560
- Let's do our best!
- Let's do our best!

264
00:14:47,560 --> 00:14:48,680
Do our best!

265
00:14:51,360 --> 00:14:52,840
- Let's go!
- Let's go!

266
00:14:53,480 --> 00:14:54,200
Cheers.

267
00:14:59,040 --> 00:15:01,160
How did you
come up with this English name?

268
00:15:01,760 --> 00:15:03,120
I wanted to give you a surprise.

269
00:15:05,800 --> 00:15:06,800
Stream?

270
00:15:06,800 --> 00:15:07,960
It's obviously Lin Xi.

271
00:15:07,960 --> 00:15:09,080
It's such a bad pun.

272
00:15:09,080 --> 00:15:10,280
Xie Ang?

273
00:15:10,280 --> 00:15:11,320
Why are you here?

274
00:15:11,520 --> 00:15:12,640
I represent the East Gate Squad

275
00:15:12,640 --> 00:15:14,320
to send you our blessings

276
00:15:14,320 --> 00:15:16,000
for your new company's establishment.

277
00:15:16,440 --> 00:15:16,920
This is

278
00:15:16,920 --> 00:15:18,160
a barley bouquet from Gao Yunlang.

279
00:15:18,400 --> 00:15:20,240
Your smart band
will be selling like hotcakes.

280
00:15:20,720 --> 00:15:21,440
These are

281
00:15:21,440 --> 00:15:22,880
persimmon and peanuts from Chen Mo.

282
00:15:22,880 --> 00:15:24,360
Good things will happen to you.

283
00:15:24,880 --> 00:15:25,640
This one as well.

284
00:15:26,321 --> 00:15:27,400
Green pine from Jiang Yimian.

285
00:15:27,400 --> 00:15:28,880
Hope everything goes easily for you.

286
00:15:29,960 --> 00:15:31,560
These are all puns.

287
00:15:31,560 --> 00:15:33,080
How dare you say ours is bad?

288
00:15:33,080 --> 00:15:34,040
That's not all.

289
00:15:34,040 --> 00:15:36,080
Finally, I'm giving you

290
00:15:36,080 --> 00:15:37,760
a high-end business genius.

291
00:15:39,200 --> 00:15:40,000
Me.

292
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:42,640
Xie Ang. I hope your business
will be prosperous.

293
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:44,640
Didn't you plan to
"lie flat" for a while?

294
00:15:44,640 --> 00:15:45,600
Yes.

295
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:49,280
I thought about it.

296
00:15:49,640 --> 00:15:50,680
I like starting a business

297
00:15:51,320 --> 00:15:52,360
and like you both.

298
00:15:52,680 --> 00:15:55,000
So, the best choice

299
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:56,400
is to do something I like

300
00:15:56,400 --> 00:15:57,680
with the people I like.

301
00:15:58,400 --> 00:15:59,000
I'd like that.

302
00:15:59,800 --> 00:16:01,080
I absolutely like that.

303
00:16:01,600 --> 00:16:03,280
Thank you for accepting me.

304
00:16:03,280 --> 00:16:04,880
We will be
the three musketeers from now on.

305
00:16:10,530 --> 00:16:16,060
(Two years later)

306
00:16:16,680 --> 00:16:17,200
Here you go.

307
00:16:17,320 --> 00:16:18,160
Thank you.

308
00:16:20,320 --> 00:16:21,280
Besides a patented design,

309
00:16:21,280 --> 00:16:22,760
our smart band

310
00:16:22,760 --> 00:16:24,720
also has international 3C certification.

311
00:16:24,720 --> 00:16:26,160
Currently, we have
targeted collaboration

312
00:16:26,160 --> 00:16:27,320
with many hospitals.

313
00:16:27,560 --> 00:16:28,720
However, we don't have much reputation

314
00:16:28,720 --> 00:16:29,760
in the market yet.

315
00:16:29,760 --> 00:16:31,920
So, we hope
a knowledgeable blogger like you

316
00:16:31,920 --> 00:16:32,920
who is strict with quality control

317
00:16:32,920 --> 00:16:33,880
and has many fans

318
00:16:33,880 --> 00:16:35,560
can help us promote our product.

319
00:16:36,080 --> 00:16:36,720
Understood.

320
00:16:37,320 --> 00:16:39,040
I heard about it from
my friends at the hospital.

321
00:16:39,440 --> 00:16:40,360
To be honest,

322
00:16:40,640 --> 00:16:41,800
I'm very interested.

323
00:16:41,800 --> 00:16:42,320
Really?

324
00:16:42,320 --> 00:16:43,120
That's great.

325
00:16:43,120 --> 00:16:44,200
I'll ask the Operation Department

326
00:16:44,200 --> 00:16:45,320
to send the new products to you.

327
00:16:45,320 --> 00:16:45,920
Sure.

328
00:16:46,200 --> 00:16:47,440
I'll be leaving then.

329
00:16:47,800 --> 00:16:48,400
Okay.

330
00:16:49,680 --> 00:16:50,800
- To a great collaboration.
- To a great collaboration.

331
00:16:50,840 --> 00:16:51,520
Take care.

332
00:17:06,760 --> 00:17:08,120
I'm in the company's lounge area.

333
00:17:08,640 --> 00:17:09,040
Sure.

334
00:17:09,040 --> 00:17:09,760
I'll be waiting for you.

335
00:17:18,440 --> 00:17:19,000
Excuse me.

336
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:20,080
Where is your lounge?

337
00:17:20,080 --> 00:17:21,040
I'm looking for Mr. Xie.

338
00:17:21,320 --> 00:17:21,960
It's over there.

339
00:17:21,960 --> 00:17:22,680
Thank you.

340
00:17:22,680 --> 00:17:23,320
You're welcome.

341
00:17:24,160 --> 00:17:24,680
Sorry.

342
00:17:24,680 --> 00:17:25,480
I'm late.

343
00:17:25,800 --> 00:17:26,320
It's all right.

344
00:17:26,320 --> 00:17:27,000
Please sit down.

345
00:17:27,480 --> 00:17:28,440
I was busy as well.

346
00:17:28,880 --> 00:17:30,040
Let me introduce myself.

347
00:17:30,320 --> 00:17:32,040
I'm the company's Marketing Director,

348
00:17:32,040 --> 00:17:32,640
Xie Ang.

349
00:17:33,360 --> 00:17:33,840
Hello.

350
00:17:33,840 --> 00:17:35,080
I am the owner of the public account,

351
00:17:35,080 --> 00:17:36,200
"Xiaomian Loves Sports"

352
00:17:36,200 --> 00:17:37,160
I am Liu Yimian.

353
00:17:43,680 --> 00:17:44,600
What's wrong?

354
00:17:45,360 --> 00:17:46,000
It's nothing.

355
00:17:46,880 --> 00:17:48,120
It reminds me of a friend.

356
00:17:48,600 --> 00:17:49,480
Her name is Yimian too.

357
00:17:51,640 --> 00:17:53,480
This is the latest data
from our smart band.

358
00:17:53,480 --> 00:17:54,400
Take a look.

359
00:17:54,640 --> 00:17:55,360
Sure.

360
00:17:59,466 --> 00:18:00,706
(Liu Yimian)

361
00:18:10,880 --> 00:18:12,200
The focus of the cosmetics expo

362
00:18:12,200 --> 00:18:13,000
is local products.

363
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:14,400
The main target audience
is young people.

364
00:18:14,640 --> 00:18:15,240
So...

365
00:18:17,360 --> 00:18:18,840
So, the editing, arrangement

366
00:18:18,840 --> 00:18:19,600
and feeling

367
00:18:19,600 --> 00:18:21,840
must highlight fashion and design
apart from the tradition.

368
00:18:25,440 --> 00:18:26,200
It's fine.

369
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:28,760
I suggest

370
00:18:28,760 --> 00:18:30,680
you add some ACG elements.

371
00:18:30,960 --> 00:18:32,840
I need to amend
the text materials again.

372
00:18:33,160 --> 00:18:34,120
I'll send it to you later.

373
00:18:35,240 --> 00:18:36,320
Okay. I understand.

374
00:18:53,680 --> 00:18:54,240
I told you

375
00:18:54,240 --> 00:18:55,520
not to wear heels anymore.

376
00:18:56,240 --> 00:18:57,160
You scratched your heel.

377
00:18:59,400 --> 00:19:00,000
Come.

378
00:19:05,720 --> 00:19:06,480
Does it still hurt?

379
00:19:06,960 --> 00:19:07,840
No.

380
00:19:08,600 --> 00:19:09,600
Be good next time.

381
00:19:10,040 --> 00:19:10,560
Come.

382
00:19:35,360 --> 00:19:36,200
Coming.

383
00:19:41,680 --> 00:19:42,320
It's been a long time.

384
00:19:42,320 --> 00:19:43,520
You are very punctual.

385
00:19:43,520 --> 00:19:44,960
I just finished cooking. Time to eat.

386
00:19:44,960 --> 00:19:45,920
What did you make? Smells nice.

387
00:19:45,920 --> 00:19:46,800
Steak.

388
00:19:48,840 --> 00:19:49,880
How is your thesis?

389
00:19:50,960 --> 00:19:51,560
It is approved.

390
00:19:54,400 --> 00:19:55,640
Let's eat.

391
00:19:56,080 --> 00:19:56,600
Come.

392
00:19:58,120 --> 00:19:59,480
Congratulations on
getting your thesis approved

393
00:19:59,480 --> 00:20:00,360
and your Doctor's degree graduation.

394
00:20:03,240 --> 00:20:04,240
Let's eat.

395
00:20:10,360 --> 00:20:11,720
This is the sale ratio

396
00:20:11,720 --> 00:20:13,080
of various channels
during the shopping festival.

397
00:20:13,080 --> 00:20:14,280
Online flagship store,

398
00:20:14,280 --> 00:20:15,920
43.61%.

399
00:20:16,160 --> 00:20:17,360
Promotion from verified accounts,

400
00:20:17,360 --> 00:20:18,760
7.39%.

401
00:20:18,760 --> 00:20:20,960
Collaboration with hospitals, 32.63%.

402
00:20:20,960 --> 00:20:23,320
Malls, 14.36%.

403
00:20:23,720 --> 00:20:25,840
The rest is around 5%.

404
00:20:26,320 --> 00:20:27,520
There's another piece of good news.

405
00:20:27,760 --> 00:20:29,320
Our smart band shipments

406
00:20:29,320 --> 00:20:30,720
for this shopping festival

407
00:20:30,720 --> 00:20:32,360
officially exceeded 200,000 units.

408
00:20:36,160 --> 00:20:37,560
The hard work

409
00:20:37,560 --> 00:20:38,800
of the Marketing Department

410
00:20:38,800 --> 00:20:40,280
is essential to obtaining this result.

411
00:20:40,600 --> 00:20:41,560
So, I decided

412
00:20:41,800 --> 00:20:43,840
to give everyone
three days of paid holiday.

413
00:20:45,760 --> 00:20:46,520
Everyone.

414
00:20:46,720 --> 00:20:47,400
Shouldn't we

415
00:20:47,400 --> 00:20:48,960
go out and celebrate no matter what?

416
00:20:49,160 --> 00:20:50,520
Buffet, barbecue

417
00:20:50,520 --> 00:20:51,280
or Japanese cuisine.

418
00:20:51,280 --> 00:20:51,760
Pick one.

419
00:20:51,760 --> 00:20:54,640
Barbecue! I want a barbecue!

420
00:20:54,640 --> 00:20:55,280
Japanese cuisine!

421
00:20:55,280 --> 00:20:56,040
(28th March, Lin Xi's birthday)
Buffet!

422
00:20:56,040 --> 00:20:57,320
I want to eat a buffet!

423
00:20:57,320 --> 00:20:58,000
Buffet!

424
00:20:58,000 --> 00:20:59,040
Everyone,

425
00:20:59,040 --> 00:20:59,880
I'm sorry.

426
00:20:59,880 --> 00:21:00,480
I won't be joining.

427
00:21:00,480 --> 00:21:01,480
There's something I need to do.

428
00:21:01,720 --> 00:21:03,000
Order anything you want.

429
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:04,160
Claim from me afterwards.

430
00:21:04,800 --> 00:21:05,560
I'm leaving.

431
00:21:06,160 --> 00:21:06,720
Go.

432
00:21:07,800 --> 00:21:08,920
Thank you, Boss!

433
00:21:10,520 --> 00:21:13,420
(Inpatient Department)

434
00:21:13,560 --> 00:21:15,360
Do you still remember
the man in ward four?

435
00:21:15,680 --> 00:21:16,760
He came in because of a fever.

436
00:21:17,280 --> 00:21:17,760
Initially,

437
00:21:17,760 --> 00:21:19,120
we suspected a cardiopulmonary problem.

438
00:21:19,560 --> 00:21:22,000
We did various tests including
a routine blood scan,

439
00:21:22,440 --> 00:21:24,280
CT scan and bone marrow aspiration.

440
00:21:24,280 --> 00:21:25,560
Thankfully, we discovered it early.

441
00:21:25,560 --> 00:21:27,120
He has been transferred
to the Hematology Department now.

442
00:21:27,480 --> 00:21:28,800
There's a saying in the hospital.

443
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:30,720
Heart, lungs, spleen, kidneys,
brain, and nerves.

444
00:21:30,720 --> 00:21:31,960
External injury,
infection and skin diseases.

445
00:21:32,440 --> 00:21:33,520
Everything will cause a fever.

446
00:21:33,920 --> 00:21:34,760
So, be careful

447
00:21:34,760 --> 00:21:35,920
when a fever occurs.

448
00:21:45,440 --> 00:21:46,760
How do you feel today?

449
00:21:47,320 --> 00:21:48,080
Doctor.

450
00:21:48,880 --> 00:21:49,920
I am thirsty.

451
00:21:49,920 --> 00:21:50,360
Sure.

452
00:21:50,360 --> 00:21:51,360
Please wait a while.

453
00:21:52,240 --> 00:21:53,800
Do you think you can give him water

454
00:21:53,800 --> 00:21:54,760
with his condition?

455
00:21:59,240 --> 00:22:00,120
Sorry, Professor.

456
00:22:00,560 --> 00:22:01,160
Lin Xi.

457
00:22:01,840 --> 00:22:02,680
Explain.

458
00:22:03,520 --> 00:22:04,360
No.

459
00:22:04,360 --> 00:22:05,040
Why?

460
00:22:05,520 --> 00:22:06,880
IV drip is used after surgery.

461
00:22:06,880 --> 00:22:07,920
The patient won't feel thirsty usually.

462
00:22:08,280 --> 00:22:08,920
This should be

463
00:22:08,920 --> 00:22:10,280
a change in the endocrine system

464
00:22:10,280 --> 00:22:11,360
after trauma,

465
00:22:11,360 --> 00:22:12,360
causing fake thirst.

466
00:22:13,080 --> 00:22:13,640
Good.

467
00:22:15,200 --> 00:22:16,040
Don't drink for now.

468
00:22:32,280 --> 00:22:32,880
Sorry

469
00:22:32,880 --> 00:22:33,520
to keep you waiting.

470
00:22:35,320 --> 00:22:36,200
Doctor.

471
00:22:36,480 --> 00:22:37,520
Do we know each other?

472
00:22:39,880 --> 00:22:41,000
Enough.

473
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:42,280
I'm off duty.

474
00:22:42,600 --> 00:22:44,600
This is now your girlfriend,

475
00:22:44,600 --> 00:22:45,600
Lin Xi.

476
00:22:46,720 --> 00:22:48,360
Do you still know you are my girlfriend?

477
00:22:48,880 --> 00:22:50,120
How long have we not seen each other?

478
00:22:52,720 --> 00:22:53,640
Half a month?

479
00:22:55,080 --> 00:22:56,560
Ever since you became a doctor
doing standardized training,

480
00:22:57,120 --> 00:22:57,840
I felt like

481
00:22:57,840 --> 00:22:59,040
we're having
a long-distance relationship.

482
00:23:01,880 --> 00:23:03,240
I didn't expect

483
00:23:03,240 --> 00:23:04,440
there's a harder job in this world

484
00:23:04,440 --> 00:23:05,360
than being an entrepreneur.

485
00:23:06,720 --> 00:23:08,040
But I'm amazing today.

486
00:23:08,360 --> 00:23:09,360
Besides checking the wards,

487
00:23:09,360 --> 00:23:10,640
I also helped out with three surgeries.

488
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:11,720
Are you so great?

489
00:23:13,760 --> 00:23:14,920
Sounds tiring.

490
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:18,960
A little.

491
00:23:29,520 --> 00:23:30,760
I feel like

492
00:23:30,760 --> 00:23:32,480
I'm so busy recently
that I've become dumb.

493
00:23:32,920 --> 00:23:34,000
You are quite dumb indeed.

494
00:23:34,400 --> 00:23:36,040
How can you forget
such an important day?

495
00:23:55,560 --> 00:23:57,160
What day is it?

496
00:23:57,160 --> 00:23:58,640
Even the meal is so luxurious.

497
00:23:59,240 --> 00:24:00,000
Take a guess.

498
00:24:01,040 --> 00:24:02,680
The anniversary of
Stream's establishment?

499
00:24:04,040 --> 00:24:05,480
It's March now.

500
00:24:05,480 --> 00:24:06,960
My company was established in July

501
00:24:06,960 --> 00:24:07,680
two years ago.

502
00:24:07,920 --> 00:24:09,120
Your guess is way off.

503
00:24:10,920 --> 00:24:11,920
I got it.

504
00:24:12,720 --> 00:24:13,680
Do you remember now?

505
00:24:14,160 --> 00:24:16,240
The most accurate way
to determine a tumor

506
00:24:16,240 --> 00:24:17,320
is still a CT scan.

507
00:24:18,960 --> 00:24:20,480
Your work is still not done yet?

508
00:24:21,080 --> 00:24:21,880
Soon.

509
00:24:21,880 --> 00:24:23,320
I just need to finish this report.

510
00:24:24,560 --> 00:24:25,720
You might get carsick

511
00:24:25,720 --> 00:24:26,800
from typing in the car.

512
00:24:29,800 --> 00:24:31,000
I do feel quite dizzy.

513
00:24:32,280 --> 00:24:33,800
So, is today your birthday,

514
00:24:33,800 --> 00:24:34,520
my birthday,

515
00:24:34,520 --> 00:24:35,280
the establishment of East Gate Squad

516
00:24:35,280 --> 00:24:36,560
or our anniversary?

517
00:24:36,960 --> 00:24:38,600
Stop playing guessing games with me.

518
00:24:39,880 --> 00:24:41,160
Today is your birthday.

519
00:24:44,320 --> 00:24:45,600
It really is.

520
00:24:47,640 --> 00:24:50,200
So, where are you taking me?

521
00:24:51,280 --> 00:24:52,560
I'm taking you home and we'll have cake.

522
00:24:52,760 --> 00:24:53,680
Great!

523
00:25:00,040 --> 00:25:01,840
This is not the way to my home.

524
00:25:01,840 --> 00:25:02,760
We are going to my home.

525
00:25:03,920 --> 00:25:05,120
But I have to go back
to the hospital tomorrow.

526
00:25:05,120 --> 00:25:06,680
I'll send you to the hospital tomorrow.

527
00:25:07,360 --> 00:25:08,120
But you need to

528
00:25:08,480 --> 00:25:09,840
stay with me tonight.

529
00:25:35,840 --> 00:25:36,720
Don't fall asleep.

530
00:25:36,720 --> 00:25:37,720
You haven't eaten the cake yet.

531
00:25:37,720 --> 00:25:38,440
I'm not sleeping.

532
00:25:38,440 --> 00:25:39,440
I'm just taking a nap.

533
00:25:39,440 --> 00:25:41,280
Your sofa is so comfortable.

534
00:25:41,720 --> 00:25:42,720
You have a better relationship
with the sofa

535
00:25:42,720 --> 00:25:43,640
than me.

536
00:25:44,080 --> 00:25:45,240
I'm getting the cake.

537
00:25:45,240 --> 00:25:46,160
Stay awake.

538
00:26:04,520 --> 00:26:05,480
Are you asleep?

539
00:26:14,720 --> 00:26:15,960
Today is your birthday.

540
00:26:17,280 --> 00:26:19,200
Why am I having a birthday again?

541
00:26:21,280 --> 00:26:22,040
You are eighteen.

542
00:26:23,400 --> 00:26:24,640
Liar.

543
00:26:24,960 --> 00:26:26,360
I'm already 25 years old.

♪As if I were watching the starry sky♪

546
00:26:31,920 --> 00:26:33,360
Do you want to blow out the candles?

547
00:26:41,360 --> 00:26:42,720
Make a wish at least.

548
00:26:44,240 --> 00:26:47,880
I hope I can sleep
until I wake up naturally.

549
00:26:48,800 --> 00:26:49,520
What else?

550
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:50,800
That's all.

551
00:26:54,120 --> 00:26:55,340
♪Should I tell her♪

552
00:26:55,410 --> 00:26:56,206
♪That I'm noticing her too♪

553
00:26:56,206 --> 00:26:59,066
♪When she tries to
steal a glance at me again?♪

554
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:00,880
You're just brushing me off?

555
00:27:02,080 --> 00:27:04,320
My dream now

556
00:27:05,240 --> 00:27:08,160
is to have

557
00:27:08,640 --> 00:27:10,560
a soft pillow

558
00:27:11,680 --> 00:27:14,160
so I can sleep until the morning.

559
00:27:15,160 --> 00:27:16,440
This pillow is not bad.

560
00:27:18,360 --> 00:27:19,560
Just use it then.

561
00:27:22,047 --> 00:27:23,767
I remember it was the same for you
last year.

562
00:27:24,840 --> 00:27:26,160
You were so busy.

563
00:27:27,440 --> 00:27:28,760
You didn't even get to eat cake.

564
00:27:29,200 --> 00:27:30,280
There was no choice.

565
00:27:30,680 --> 00:27:32,920
As a family member of a medical student,

566
00:27:33,640 --> 00:27:34,520
we might

567
00:27:34,520 --> 00:27:36,840
spend my birthday like this
every year in the future.

568
00:27:37,026 --> 00:27:39,413
♪That beating heart♪

Mianmian.

575
00:28:05,320 --> 00:28:06,200
Your letter.

576
00:28:06,200 --> 00:28:06,880
Thank you.

577
00:28:14,480 --> 00:28:15,680
Lin Xi.

578
00:28:16,080 --> 00:28:18,120
We are inviting you
to report to Chunhui High School

579
00:28:18,120 --> 00:28:19,520
with this admission notice

580
00:28:19,520 --> 00:28:21,320
on the 8th of May.

581
00:28:27,240 --> 00:28:28,400
(Did you guys receive the invitation)

582
00:28:28,400 --> 00:28:29,560
(for the alumni gathering?)

583
00:28:29,920 --> 00:28:30,960
(Are you guys coming?)

584
00:28:31,720 --> 00:28:33,560
(I have an interview that day.)

585
00:28:33,560 --> 00:28:34,560
(I can't make it.)

586
00:28:34,560 --> 00:28:35,520
(My life as a company slave)

587
00:28:35,520 --> 00:28:37,200
(has been fully scheduled.)

588
00:28:37,640 --> 00:28:38,840
(I don't think I can make it too.)

589
00:28:38,840 --> 00:28:40,120
(My schedule of a business trip
has been fixed.)

590
00:28:40,760 --> 00:28:41,800
(I have to work overtime.)

591
00:28:41,800 --> 00:28:43,320
(I will probably
have a hard time flying there.)

592
00:28:43,320 --> 00:28:44,360
(Forget about Chen Mo.)

593
00:28:44,360 --> 00:28:46,160
(He is basically living in the lab now.)

594
00:28:47,000 --> 00:28:48,120
(I have to check my schedule.)

595
00:28:50,160 --> 00:28:52,400
I thought we could
gather at Chunhui High School.

596
00:28:53,440 --> 00:28:53,960
(Forget it.)

597
00:28:53,960 --> 00:28:54,880
(I won't be going then.)

598
00:28:56,200 --> 00:28:56,920
Don't.

599
00:28:57,560 --> 00:28:58,520
(No.)

600
00:28:58,520 --> 00:28:59,360
(We are hoping)

601
00:28:59,360 --> 00:29:00,440
(you can do a live broadcast for us.)

602
00:29:00,840 --> 00:29:01,320
(Yes.)

603
00:29:01,320 --> 00:29:02,560
(This activity)

604
00:29:02,560 --> 00:29:04,120
(sounds very fun.)

605
00:29:04,960 --> 00:29:07,520
(Perhaps I will be free then.)

606
00:29:08,680 --> 00:29:10,640
(If you want to go,
I will accompany you.)

607
00:29:11,720 --> 00:29:12,520
(Fine.)

608
00:29:12,520 --> 00:29:13,280
(I will go)

609
00:29:13,280 --> 00:29:14,920
(as a representative
of East Gate Squad.)

610
00:29:34,360 --> 00:29:35,720
We are finally back here.

611
00:29:35,720 --> 00:29:36,560
(83rd School Establishment
Anniversary Event, Invitation)

612
00:29:39,040 --> 00:29:40,800
This gate looks small.

613
00:29:41,080 --> 00:29:42,520
I remember it being bigger.

614
00:29:43,720 --> 00:29:44,760
The gate is still the same.

615
00:29:45,040 --> 00:29:46,800
It's because we grew up.

616
00:29:48,600 --> 00:29:50,280
Isn't it a gathering?

617
00:29:50,280 --> 00:29:51,440
Why is the place empty?

618
00:29:52,320 --> 00:29:54,080
It hasn't started yet.

619
00:29:54,080 --> 00:29:55,480
We are one hour early.

620
00:29:56,640 --> 00:29:57,320
Great.

621
00:29:57,320 --> 00:29:58,840
I will record a video for Jiang Yimian.

622
00:29:59,360 --> 00:30:00,440
Hello, everyone.

623
00:30:00,440 --> 00:30:01,320
Hello.

624
00:30:01,320 --> 00:30:02,560
We are back in school again.

625
00:30:03,280 --> 00:30:03,800
Let me show you

626
00:30:03,800 --> 00:30:05,080
our school gate.

627
00:30:06,440 --> 00:30:07,920
We are going inside.

628
00:30:08,160 --> 00:30:09,000
Bye.

629
00:30:09,640 --> 00:30:10,800
Let's go.

630
00:30:22,040 --> 00:30:24,360
It's a surprise to see
the bicycle shed moving somewhere else

631
00:30:24,680 --> 00:30:26,080
and the boiler room is gone.

632
00:30:26,840 --> 00:30:28,680
Even the tables and chairs
on the rooftop

633
00:30:28,680 --> 00:30:29,320
are gone.

634
00:30:30,720 --> 00:30:32,400
Everything is changing.

635
00:30:32,800 --> 00:30:33,880
We are the only ones
that haven't changed.

636
00:30:36,520 --> 00:30:37,800
I think you've changed too.

637
00:30:41,400 --> 00:30:42,320
You become cuter.

638
00:30:44,520 --> 00:30:46,160
When I first met you,

639
00:30:46,480 --> 00:30:49,160
you were cool, cruel,
and had a sharp tongue.

640
00:30:50,200 --> 00:30:51,160
You've changed too.

641
00:30:51,680 --> 00:30:53,000
You were like a cup of milk tea.

642
00:30:53,280 --> 00:30:54,040
So full of energy.

643
00:30:54,280 --> 00:30:55,400
You rushed head-first into everything.

644
00:30:56,120 --> 00:30:56,960
However, you are

645
00:30:57,200 --> 00:30:58,560
like a glass of lemon tea right now.

646
00:30:59,160 --> 00:30:59,920
Not that sweet

647
00:31:00,280 --> 00:31:01,280
and not that sour.

648
00:31:01,680 --> 00:31:03,200
Everything is just right.

649
00:31:03,680 --> 00:31:05,240
Are you reading an advertisement?

650
00:31:08,840 --> 00:31:10,480
Isn't there an event?

651
00:31:10,480 --> 00:31:11,760
Where's the vibe?

652
00:31:13,120 --> 00:31:14,080
Look over there.

653
00:31:24,080 --> 00:31:25,440
Am I mistaken?

654
00:31:25,880 --> 00:31:27,880
Are there flowers tied to the balloons?

655
00:31:29,960 --> 00:31:31,200
Are those Lilies of the Valley?

656
00:31:31,960 --> 00:31:33,640
I love them.

657
00:31:34,720 --> 00:31:36,400
There might be a surprise at the end.

658
00:31:37,400 --> 00:31:38,560
I made the calculation.

659
00:31:38,560 --> 00:31:39,160
Every balloon

660
00:31:39,160 --> 00:31:40,800
can only carry 20 grams of weight.

661
00:31:42,160 --> 00:31:43,760
It's not easy to fly so high

662
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:45,200
with something on them.

663
00:31:45,600 --> 00:31:47,840
It was difficult when I tried
to tie three leaves.

664
00:31:51,040 --> 00:31:52,400
Don't you feel

665
00:31:52,400 --> 00:31:53,880
that this moment is familiar?

666
00:31:59,840 --> 00:32:00,960
Do you still remember

667
00:32:00,960 --> 00:32:02,200
the three conditions you suggested

668
00:32:02,200 --> 00:32:03,640
when I wanted to become your friend?

669
00:32:03,640 --> 00:32:05,440
The first condition
was for leaves to fly upward.

670
00:32:05,800 --> 00:32:07,160
Just like the balloons...

671
00:32:15,920 --> 00:32:17,520
What about these star jars?

672
00:32:19,120 --> 00:32:20,120
It was you, right?

673
00:32:20,720 --> 00:32:22,160
You decorated this place, right?

674
00:32:23,000 --> 00:32:23,720
Yes.

675
00:32:23,920 --> 00:32:25,760
The organizer of this gathering

676
00:32:25,760 --> 00:32:26,640
is me.

677
00:32:27,320 --> 00:32:28,720
What are you doing?

678
00:32:29,400 --> 00:32:31,600
The leaves and star jars are here.

679
00:32:32,640 --> 00:32:33,480
Will you

680
00:32:33,680 --> 00:32:34,800
ask me

681
00:32:35,000 --> 00:32:36,720
to remove Mr. Xie's wig next?

682
00:32:38,040 --> 00:32:38,880
No need.

683
00:32:39,120 --> 00:32:39,840
Follow me.

684
00:32:55,880 --> 00:32:56,880
What is this?

685
00:32:57,840 --> 00:32:59,920
I found a computer
made in the year you were born.

686
00:33:06,280 --> 00:33:07,120
Sit down and have a look.

687
00:33:13,560 --> 00:33:14,600
Turn on the computer and take a look.

688
00:33:20,160 --> 00:33:21,560
Hello, Lin Xi.

689
00:33:21,560 --> 00:33:23,520
This is a special quiz.

690
00:33:23,520 --> 00:33:24,640
After completing the quiz,

691
00:33:24,640 --> 00:33:25,680
you will receive

692
00:33:25,680 --> 00:33:27,120
a gift that transcends time and space.

693
00:33:27,440 --> 00:33:29,000
Are you ready?

694
00:33:29,680 --> 00:33:31,280
Are you ready?

695
00:33:31,920 --> 00:33:32,520
Bring it on.

696
00:33:34,800 --> 00:33:35,760
First question.

697
00:33:35,760 --> 00:33:37,480
Who do you like?

698
00:33:37,760 --> 00:33:39,120
A, Ji Junxing.

699
00:33:39,120 --> 00:33:40,200
B, Eddie Peng.

700
00:33:42,240 --> 00:33:44,480
What if I want to choose Eddie Peng?

701
00:33:45,920 --> 00:33:46,840
Nothing much.

702
00:33:47,400 --> 00:33:49,160
The rabbit will cry.

703
00:33:49,920 --> 00:33:51,160
How will the rabbit cry?

704
00:33:58,040 --> 00:33:58,760
Fine.

705
00:33:58,760 --> 00:33:59,680
I'll give it to you.

706
00:33:59,680 --> 00:34:01,320
The person I like is you.

707
00:34:01,320 --> 00:34:01,920
How is that?

708
00:34:02,160 --> 00:34:02,960
I know.

709
00:34:05,400 --> 00:34:06,400
Second question.

710
00:34:06,680 --> 00:34:08,680
Where did you first meet?

A.

714
00:34:18,160 --> 00:34:20,520
I was so stupid that day.

715
00:34:24,520 --> 00:34:25,720
Third question.

716
00:34:26,440 --> 00:34:29,360
Which weather do you like better?

717
00:34:29,735 --> 00:34:31,335
Snow or rain.

718
00:34:32,000 --> 00:34:33,320
What if I like them both?

719
00:34:33,520 --> 00:34:34,800
Try choosing both.

720
00:34:43,440 --> 00:34:45,200
This was during the New Year.

721
00:34:46,320 --> 00:34:47,800
It is so beautiful.

722
00:34:48,160 --> 00:34:49,440
What about rain?

723
00:34:54,400 --> 00:34:55,480
It's that day!

724
00:34:57,640 --> 00:34:58,880
Do you still remember?

725
00:34:59,120 --> 00:35:00,080
Of course.

726
00:35:02,120 --> 00:35:03,240
Extra question.

727
00:35:03,480 --> 00:35:05,120
Given another chance,

728
00:35:05,120 --> 00:35:07,160
will you sit beside me again?

729
00:35:08,440 --> 00:35:09,000
Will you?

730
00:35:12,160 --> 00:35:12,800
Yes.

731
00:35:17,520 --> 00:35:19,200
It's the rabbit and the fox.

732
00:35:26,680 --> 00:35:28,840
Congratulations on passing the quiz.

733
00:35:29,120 --> 00:35:31,040
Next, please close your eyes

734
00:35:31,040 --> 00:35:33,280
and receive your gift
that transcends time and space.

735
00:35:34,600 --> 00:35:36,080
What is this mysterious gift about?

736
00:35:36,640 --> 00:35:37,640
Close your eyes.

737
00:35:51,280 --> 00:35:52,000

738
00:35:52,760 --> 00:35:53,280
Come.

739
00:35:53,280 --> 00:35:54,040
Follow me.

740
00:36:04,720 --> 00:36:05,520
Lin Xi.

741
00:36:05,520 --> 00:36:06,600
Do you trust me?

Of course.

743
00:36:08,560 --> 00:36:09,840
Wait for me here.

744
00:36:09,840 --> 00:36:10,680
Don't move.

745
00:36:17,120 --> 00:36:17,840
Ji Junxing.

746
00:36:18,120 --> 00:36:19,080
Where are you going?

747
00:36:20,680 --> 00:36:21,560
Ji Junxing.

748
00:36:22,880 --> 00:36:24,440
You didn't tell me
how long you will be gone.

749
00:36:28,640 --> 00:36:29,480
Who is it?

750
