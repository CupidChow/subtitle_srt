17
00:01:48,518 --> 00:01:49,198
(Hello.)

18
00:01:49,518 --> 00:01:52,478
(The phone you dialed is not answered
for the moment.)

19
00:02:01,100 --> 00:02:02,030
(The call is not be answered)

20
00:02:02,030 --> 00:02:03,040
(Why didn't you text me back?)

21
00:02:03,040 --> 00:02:04,240
(I'm worried about you.)

22
00:02:12,230 --> 00:02:15,970
(Three months later)

23
00:02:19,158 --> 00:02:19,798
Lin Xi.

24
00:02:33,358 --> 00:02:34,078
What's wrong?

25
00:02:34,078 --> 00:02:35,278
What's gotten into you?

26
00:02:37,478 --> 00:02:38,718
I got a 90 on my math test.

27
00:02:38,718 --> 00:02:39,838
I finally passed the test.

28
00:02:39,838 --> 00:02:40,638
Really?

29
00:02:42,638 --> 00:02:44,598
Who is this amazing tutor?

30
00:02:45,638 --> 00:02:46,278
It's me.

31
00:02:46,278 --> 00:02:46,718
Yes.

32
00:02:46,718 --> 00:02:47,558
You're amazing.

33
00:02:47,558 --> 00:02:48,998
So am I, don't you think?

34
00:02:48,998 --> 00:02:49,798
Mates,

35
00:02:49,798 --> 00:02:51,638
my score hit record highs.

36
00:02:51,638 --> 00:02:53,078
I might be able to get
into Jinghua Sports University.

37
00:02:53,078 --> 00:02:54,518
You've affected my classmates' studies.

38
00:02:54,518 --> 00:02:55,638
Okay.

39
00:02:55,638 --> 00:02:57,638
I'm excited that I got a 90 on the exam.

40
00:02:57,638 --> 00:02:58,718
Okay, alright.

41
00:03:00,118 --> 00:03:00,718
Not bad.

42
00:03:14,878 --> 00:03:15,678
Xing,

43
00:03:15,678 --> 00:03:16,478
let's play basketball.

44
00:03:17,478 --> 00:03:18,238
Count me out.

45
00:03:18,718 --> 00:03:19,398
What about the rehearsal?

46
00:03:19,918 --> 00:03:20,758
Not interested.

47
00:03:21,358 --> 00:03:21,878
Fine.

48
00:03:22,198 --> 00:03:23,078
I was going to ask

49
00:03:23,078 --> 00:03:23,758
if you'll go to Chunhui

50
00:03:23,758 --> 00:03:25,398
and give the repeaters
a mobilization speech.

51
00:03:25,798 --> 00:03:27,118
I guess you're not interested either.

52
00:03:27,758 --> 00:03:28,318
Wait.

53
00:03:29,958 --> 00:03:30,718
Where?

54
00:03:31,158 --> 00:03:31,838
Chunhui.

55
00:03:41,040 --> 00:03:44,280
(Mobilization Meeting
for Repeaters Before Exam)

56
00:03:48,678 --> 00:03:49,398
I'm done.

57
00:03:52,638 --> 00:03:53,438
I'm impressed.

58
00:03:53,438 --> 00:03:54,678
You got the right answers.

59
00:03:54,678 --> 00:03:55,918
You're quite gifted.

60
00:03:56,238 --> 00:03:57,238
What if

61
00:03:57,238 --> 00:03:58,838
I get admitted to Jinghua University?

62
00:04:00,558 --> 00:04:01,678
Just do the questions.

63
00:04:02,118 --> 00:04:02,958
Come.

64
00:04:03,358 --> 00:04:04,638
Attention, please.

65
00:04:05,478 --> 00:04:06,198
Fellow students,

66
00:04:06,678 --> 00:04:08,398
today, we've invited

67
00:04:08,398 --> 00:04:10,278
the previous excellent graduate over

68
00:04:10,278 --> 00:04:12,318
to mobilize you before the exam

69
00:04:12,998 --> 00:04:14,798
and to motivate the repeaters.

70
00:04:15,238 --> 00:04:17,438
Let's welcome
the previous excellent graduate,

71
00:04:17,718 --> 00:04:20,558
Ji Junxing from Jinghua's Department
of Computer Science,

72
00:04:20,558 --> 00:04:22,758
to come and share
his learning experience with us.

73
00:04:23,158 --> 00:04:24,998
Let's give him a round of applause.

74
00:04:30,838 --> 00:04:31,718
Why is he here?

75
00:04:32,718 --> 00:04:33,518
I don't know.

76
00:04:34,678 --> 00:04:35,398
Hello.

77
00:04:35,718 --> 00:04:37,158
I'm Ji Junxing, a freshman

78
00:04:37,158 --> 00:04:39,158
at Jinghua's Department
of Computer Science.

79
00:04:45,438 --> 00:04:46,278
Long time no see.

80
00:04:53,918 --> 00:04:55,558
It's my pleasure to come here

81
00:04:56,198 --> 00:04:57,118
and share with you.

82
00:04:58,238 --> 00:04:59,438
I know nothing about Grade 13.

83
00:05:00,398 --> 00:05:03,278
But I understand the suffering

84
00:05:03,678 --> 00:05:05,078
and expectant mood.

85
00:05:06,598 --> 00:05:07,518
It's said that

86
00:05:08,438 --> 00:05:10,318
Grade 13 is
a one-year time lag in life.

87
00:05:12,238 --> 00:05:13,278
But I beg to differ.

88
00:05:15,078 --> 00:05:15,918
I think

89
00:05:17,158 --> 00:05:18,638
everyone has their own pace.

90
00:05:20,718 --> 00:05:21,718
Some are fast,

91
00:05:23,478 --> 00:05:24,398
while some are slow.

92
00:05:27,278 --> 00:05:28,238
But you have to believe

93
00:05:29,998 --> 00:05:31,398
the person who shares values with you

94
00:05:33,518 --> 00:05:34,998
is always waiting for you
at the endpoint.

95
00:05:39,558 --> 00:05:41,558
Everyone has their own pace.

96
00:05:42,398 --> 00:05:43,358
Some are fast,

97
00:05:43,998 --> 00:05:44,918
while some are slow.

98
00:05:45,718 --> 00:05:47,078
Don't be afraid of being left behind.

99
00:05:47,878 --> 00:05:48,798
Because we'll always

100
00:05:48,798 --> 00:05:50,238
stay by your side.

101
00:05:55,790 --> 00:05:57,280
(Fight on)

102
00:05:59,490 --> 00:06:03,050
(Speaker)

103
00:06:20,038 --> 00:06:20,958
Did something

104
00:06:21,398 --> 00:06:22,478
happen lately?

105
00:06:24,558 --> 00:06:25,798
You didn't answer my call.

106
00:06:26,118 --> 00:06:27,158
You didn't text me back either.

107
00:06:28,358 --> 00:06:30,638
It's nothing.

108
00:06:31,558 --> 00:06:33,598
I was too busy.

109
00:06:34,438 --> 00:06:35,838
I was busy studying for the exam.

110
00:06:36,678 --> 00:06:38,758
After all, the college entrance exam is
only a month away.

111
00:06:39,598 --> 00:06:41,438
I don't have time for other things.

112
00:06:42,998 --> 00:06:44,198
You don't even have time

113
00:06:44,198 --> 00:06:45,198
to call me once a month?

114
00:06:50,638 --> 00:06:51,838
It's not that.

115
00:06:53,678 --> 00:06:54,638
Just because I had called

116
00:06:54,918 --> 00:06:56,638
you every time I got my phone back.

117
00:06:57,838 --> 00:06:59,518
I seldom talked to my parents.

118
00:07:00,318 --> 00:07:03,238
I felt sorry for them.

119
00:07:03,758 --> 00:07:05,518
So I contacted them more.

120
00:07:12,998 --> 00:07:14,718
How have you been?

121
00:07:15,638 --> 00:07:16,638
Is there anything new

122
00:07:16,638 --> 00:07:17,878
to share with me?

123
00:07:21,278 --> 00:07:22,398
Well,

124
00:07:23,798 --> 00:07:24,918
I don't think so.

125
00:07:25,718 --> 00:07:27,838
There's nothing special.

126
00:07:29,838 --> 00:07:31,438
Grade 13 and Grade 12 are
pretty much the same.

127
00:07:31,798 --> 00:07:33,158
Just that I'll feel more pressure.

128
00:07:35,278 --> 00:07:36,758
When we got the result

129
00:07:36,758 --> 00:07:37,958
of the third trial exam,

130
00:07:37,958 --> 00:07:39,558
the students cried their eyes out.

131
00:07:42,478 --> 00:07:43,798
You've had the third trial exam.

132
00:07:49,158 --> 00:07:50,638
The last time we called,

133
00:07:52,158 --> 00:07:53,358
you hadn't had the second trial.

134
00:07:58,558 --> 00:07:59,158
Right.

135
00:07:59,718 --> 00:08:01,438
Time passes by so quickly.

136
00:08:03,198 --> 00:08:03,958
What about you?

137
00:08:04,358 --> 00:08:05,638
How are you doing?

138
00:08:07,278 --> 00:08:09,238
I'm doing fine.

139
00:08:09,958 --> 00:08:11,518
Our Drama Club is going on a tour.

140
00:08:12,318 --> 00:08:13,878
Is it still Hamlet?

141
00:08:15,958 --> 00:08:17,198
The show is over.

142
00:08:18,478 --> 00:08:20,038
We're rehearsing Blue Bird now.

143
00:08:29,198 --> 00:08:29,718
By the way,

144
00:08:29,998 --> 00:08:31,998
there's one thing you might not know.

145
00:08:32,478 --> 00:08:34,198
Xie Ang broke up with Jiang Yimian.

146
00:08:34,998 --> 00:08:36,398
Gao Yunlang has a girlfriend now.

147
00:08:36,958 --> 00:08:37,758
Really?

148
00:08:38,398 --> 00:08:39,838
Didn't you say Xie Ang

149
00:08:39,838 --> 00:08:40,918
just confessed to her

150
00:08:40,918 --> 00:08:42,358
and Gao Yunlang just received
a love letter?

151
00:08:45,038 --> 00:08:45,798
This feels

152
00:08:45,798 --> 00:08:47,398
like a conversation several months ago.

153
00:08:49,758 --> 00:08:51,158
I feel like I'm in a time warp.

154
00:08:56,678 --> 00:08:57,478
After all,

155
00:08:58,078 --> 00:09:00,238
we're adapting to a new life,

156
00:09:01,118 --> 00:09:02,198
and a new environment now.

157
00:09:04,998 --> 00:09:06,278
We're not together.

158
00:09:09,678 --> 00:09:10,918
We can't be on the same page.

159
00:09:14,558 --> 00:09:15,158
Lin Xi.

160
00:09:15,518 --> 00:09:16,118
Lin Xi.

161
00:09:18,198 --> 00:09:18,838
Let's go.

162
00:09:24,278 --> 00:09:25,718
I'm going back to study.

163
00:09:25,998 --> 00:09:26,958
There's an exam tomorrow.

164
00:09:27,998 --> 00:09:28,598
Bye.

165
00:09:39,598 --> 00:09:40,558
What did he say to you?

166
00:09:41,158 --> 00:09:42,518
He asked you to work harder.

167
00:09:42,518 --> 00:09:43,278
I don't believe it.

168
00:09:43,278 --> 00:09:44,038
Lin Xi!

169
00:09:48,078 --> 00:09:49,318
Don't forget about our promise.

170
00:09:52,478 --> 00:09:53,638
I'll wait for you at Jinghua University.

171
00:09:56,038 --> 00:09:56,718
I remember.

172
00:10:17,440 --> 00:10:19,270

Yes.

Can you get into Jinghua University?

184
00:10:40,118 --> 00:10:40,918
Yes, I can.

You did it!

Oh god!

187

You can get into Jinghua University.

188

We did it.

I miss you so much.

207

I can feel it. I feel it.

208
00:11:58,638 --> 00:11:59,358
Lin Xi,

209
00:11:59,358 --> 00:12:01,038
from now on, you're our junior.

210
00:12:01,038 --> 00:12:01,598
Sure.

211
00:12:01,598 --> 00:12:02,678
Seniors,

212
00:12:02,678 --> 00:12:03,998
please take care of me.

213
00:12:03,998 --> 00:12:04,718
Of course.

214
00:12:04,718 --> 00:12:06,158
Just rest assured and follow our lead.

215
00:12:06,158 --> 00:12:07,318
We've narrowed down a list

216
00:12:07,318 --> 00:12:08,118

around Jinghua University.

218
00:12:09,678 --> 00:12:10,958
We've also filtered out the bad choices.

219
00:12:10,958 --> 00:12:11,678
Is that so?

220
00:12:11,678 --> 00:12:12,958
I'd like to have the barbecue.

221
00:12:12,958 --> 00:12:14,438
Ji Junxing knows you so well.

222
00:12:14,438 --> 00:12:16,038
He has made a reservation
at the best barbecue restaurant

223
00:12:16,038 --> 00:12:17,038
in Jingzhou to welcome you.

Lin Xi.

225
00:12:26,118 --> 00:12:27,798
Do you have to be so excited
to see Jiang Yimian?

226
00:12:27,798 --> 00:12:28,718
You even forgot your luggage.

227
00:12:29,998 --> 00:12:31,358
Isn't this Qin Kai?

228
00:12:32,038 --> 00:12:32,758
Long time no see.

229
00:12:32,758 --> 00:12:34,198
- Long time no see.
- Long time no see.

230
00:12:34,798 --> 00:12:35,878
You got into Jinghua University too?

231
00:12:36,398 --> 00:12:36,958
Yes.

232
00:12:37,438 --> 00:12:40,798
I got admitted to the Sport University
beside Jinghua University.

233
00:12:42,438 --> 00:12:43,238
Impressive.

234
00:12:43,238 --> 00:12:44,918
It's kind of number one
in the world of sports.

235
00:12:45,758 --> 00:12:47,478
I've got the capability, after all.

236
00:12:48,598 --> 00:12:49,718
Let's hang out sometime.

237
00:12:49,718 --> 00:12:50,398
Sure.

238
00:12:53,878 --> 00:12:54,518
Your luggage.

239
00:12:54,518 --> 00:12:55,198
Thanks.

242
00:13:05,678 --> 00:13:08,158
Welcome back to our team, Lin Xi.

243
00:13:08,158 --> 00:13:09,798
Cheers!

244
00:13:13,278 --> 00:13:14,478
We, the East Gate Squad, have

245
00:13:14,478 --> 00:13:15,558
finally become a whole.

246
00:13:15,918 --> 00:13:16,678
Unfortunately,

247
00:13:16,678 --> 00:13:17,398
Ji Junxing is late.

248
00:13:17,398 --> 00:13:18,398
One of the six is missing for now.

249
00:13:19,878 --> 00:13:21,038
Who said that?

250
00:13:21,038 --> 00:13:22,238
Aren't there six people here?

251
00:13:24,598 --> 00:13:25,598
You must be Yueyue.

252
00:13:26,558 --> 00:13:27,158
Hello.

253
00:13:27,878 --> 00:13:29,118
I always heard them talking about you.

254
00:13:29,118 --> 00:13:30,038
So I brazened it out and asked

255
00:13:30,038 --> 00:13:31,558
Gao Yunlang to bring me here
for a free meal.

256
00:13:33,038 --> 00:13:34,438
I'm also quite curious about you.

257
00:13:34,718 --> 00:13:36,278
We've known Gao Yunlang for years.

258
00:13:36,278 --> 00:13:37,718
We've never heard him talking
about his love life.

259
00:13:38,478 --> 00:13:39,798
What's so good about being
in a relationship?

260
00:13:39,798 --> 00:13:41,198
Isn't having the barbecue

261
00:13:41,198 --> 00:13:42,318
or using the phone more fun?

262
00:13:42,958 --> 00:13:43,678
Right.

263
00:13:43,678 --> 00:13:44,998
What is a boyfriend?

264
00:13:44,998 --> 00:13:46,118
I must've been blinded

265
00:13:46,118 --> 00:13:47,118
and possessed

266
00:13:47,118 --> 00:13:48,398
to have you as my boyfriend.

267
00:13:49,558 --> 00:13:51,238
You guys broke up again?

268
00:13:51,238 --> 00:13:52,358
They have broken up so many times.

269
00:13:53,678 --> 00:13:55,878
It looks like I've missed
a lot of dramas this year.

270
00:13:56,398 --> 00:13:57,838
Can anyone here tell me about it?

271
00:14:04,798 --> 00:14:05,278
Enough.

272
00:14:05,278 --> 00:14:06,358
There's nothing to say about us.

273
00:14:06,358 --> 00:14:07,358
Talk about someone else.

274
00:14:07,358 --> 00:14:08,318
I don't want to hear it either.

275
00:14:08,318 --> 00:14:09,198
Let's talk about someone else.

276
00:14:09,198 --> 00:14:10,198
Let's talk about me.

277
00:14:10,198 --> 00:14:11,918
Actually, it was me
who courted Gao Yunlang.

278
00:14:11,918 --> 00:14:12,878
When I first saw him,

279
00:14:12,878 --> 00:14:14,518
I liked him very much.

280
00:14:14,518 --> 00:14:15,918
It was so obvious.

281
00:14:15,918 --> 00:14:17,238
What a great show.

282
00:14:17,238 --> 00:14:18,278
I should have a romance.

283
00:14:18,278 --> 00:14:19,438
Or I can't catch up with you.

284
00:14:19,838 --> 00:14:21,678
It's easy for you to do that.

285
00:14:21,678 --> 00:14:22,478
I'm waiting

286
00:14:22,478 --> 00:14:23,958
for you to date Ji Junxing.

287
00:14:24,598 --> 00:14:25,718
Why must it be him?

288
00:14:25,718 --> 00:14:27,118
Can't I like someone else?

289
00:14:27,758 --> 00:14:29,158
- Oh...
- Oh...

290
00:14:31,358 --> 00:14:32,758
What is this about?

291
00:14:58,518 --> 00:14:59,518
Ji Junxing said he's not coming today

292
00:14:59,518 --> 00:15:00,198
as he must do the rehearsal.

293
00:15:04,398 --> 00:15:04,998
Never mind.

294
00:15:04,998 --> 00:15:05,878
Let's enjoy the food.

295
00:15:05,878 --> 00:15:06,958
It's his loss to miss this.

296
00:15:18,718 --> 00:15:19,918
You might be able to deceive others.

297
00:15:19,918 --> 00:15:20,998
But you can't deceive me.

298
00:15:21,318 --> 00:15:22,798
You and Ji Junxing are giving
each other the silent treatment?

299
00:15:23,718 --> 00:15:25,078
Not exactly.

300
00:15:25,638 --> 00:15:27,918
After all, we've missed a year of time.

301
00:15:28,478 --> 00:15:29,678
People can change.

302
00:15:30,598 --> 00:15:33,878
You dated Xie Ang and broke up with him.

303
00:15:34,198 --> 00:15:35,718
Gao Yunlang has got a girlfriend.

304
00:15:36,758 --> 00:15:37,478
Therefore,

305
00:15:38,118 --> 00:15:41,318
Ji Junxing might fall in love
with someone else.

306
00:15:42,158 --> 00:15:43,038
It's impossible.

307
00:15:43,398 --> 00:15:44,678
I've been keeping an eye on him.

308
00:15:44,958 --> 00:15:46,718
There are indeed many girls
who court Ji Junxing.

309
00:15:46,718 --> 00:15:47,718
But he rejected them all.

310
00:15:48,638 --> 00:15:49,358
However,

311
00:15:49,598 --> 00:15:51,118
I think he treats
Wei Mingya differently.

312
00:15:51,718 --> 00:15:52,878
You mean the senior?

313
00:15:53,278 --> 00:15:54,518
It's impossible.

314
00:15:54,518 --> 00:15:56,198
They're just in the same club.

315
00:15:56,198 --> 00:15:57,478
Their interaction is
primarily limited to the rehearsal.

316
00:15:57,838 --> 00:15:59,638
It was Xie Ang
who asked Ji Junxing to go.

317
00:16:02,198 --> 00:16:03,158
I can take you there
if you don't believe it.

318
00:16:03,438 --> 00:16:03,998
Let's go.

319
00:16:10,678 --> 00:16:12,478
In this pursuit of love,

320
00:16:12,838 --> 00:16:14,278
I've been exhausted.

321
00:16:14,998 --> 00:16:16,078
But Hermia...

322
00:16:16,638 --> 00:16:17,838
But Hermia can find

323
00:16:17,838 --> 00:16:19,318
her happiness anywhere.

324
00:16:25,878 --> 00:16:27,038
Lysander.

325
00:16:32,238 --> 00:16:32,798
Is this

326
00:16:33,238 --> 00:16:35,038
Lysander who's on the ground?

327
00:16:35,998 --> 00:16:36,918
Lysander.

328
00:16:37,198 --> 00:16:38,638
If you're not dead,

329
00:16:39,078 --> 00:16:40,358
just wake up.

330
00:16:40,798 --> 00:16:43,518
I'll do anything for you,

331
00:16:43,518 --> 00:16:45,438
Helena, who's smart and dexterous.

332
00:16:45,798 --> 00:16:48,158
God has exquisite art skills.

333
00:16:48,158 --> 00:16:49,678
He enables me to see your soul

334
00:16:49,918 --> 00:16:51,198
through your appearance.

335
00:16:52,198 --> 00:16:53,478
Where is Demetrius?

336
00:16:53,958 --> 00:16:55,878
I want to kill him with my sword.

337
00:16:56,638 --> 00:16:57,478
Lysander,

338
00:16:57,478 --> 00:16:58,878
don't say that.

339
00:16:59,678 --> 00:17:00,798
You're the one Hermia loves.

340
00:17:01,518 --> 00:17:02,798
Just be grateful for it.

341
00:17:03,238 --> 00:17:04,158
Hermia?

342
00:17:04,998 --> 00:17:07,078
How can I be satisfied
being with her?

343
00:17:07,878 --> 00:17:08,438
No.

344
00:17:09,078 --> 00:17:10,478
I just resent

345
00:17:10,478 --> 00:17:12,358
spending time with her.

346
00:17:12,718 --> 00:17:13,718
I don't love Hermia.

347
00:17:13,718 --> 00:17:14,758
You're the one I love.

348
00:17:16,718 --> 00:17:17,718
I was young

349
00:17:18,038 --> 00:17:19,998
and immature.

350
00:17:20,638 --> 00:17:21,678
But now,

351
00:17:21,998 --> 00:17:24,398
I'm gaining knowledge and experience.

352
00:17:24,758 --> 00:17:26,198
Rationality tells me

353
00:17:27,438 --> 00:17:29,318
that you're worth my love
more than she is.

354
00:17:30,758 --> 00:17:32,438
This is the script for their stage play
on the welcoming party.

355
00:17:32,438 --> 00:17:33,758
It's adapted from Shakespeare's

356
00:17:33,758 --> 00:17:34,958
"A Midsummer Night's Dream".

357
00:17:34,958 --> 00:17:36,358
Though they're spouting ardent lines,

358
00:17:36,678 --> 00:17:37,278
there's

359
00:17:37,278 --> 00:17:38,438
little interaction between them.

360
00:17:43,118 --> 00:17:44,118
I can see that.

361
00:17:44,878 --> 00:17:46,478
There's little interaction.

362
00:17:54,358 --> 00:17:55,558
Is it included in the plot?

363
00:18:00,518 --> 00:18:01,518
In your eyes,

364
00:18:02,598 --> 00:18:03,638
I see...

365
00:18:06,838 --> 00:18:08,198
I see...

366
00:18:09,238 --> 00:18:09,998
Love.

367
00:18:10,478 --> 00:18:11,838
I see what love looks like.

368
00:18:13,598 --> 00:18:15,038
It's indeed in the script.

369
00:18:24,798 --> 00:18:25,558
Sorry.

370
00:18:26,198 --> 00:18:27,478
I'm a little off today.

371
00:18:27,878 --> 00:18:28,598
Let's call it a day.

372
00:18:29,158 --> 00:18:30,038
It's alright.

373
00:18:30,038 --> 00:18:32,278
Well, let's cancel our date tonight.

374
00:18:32,278 --> 00:18:32,918
No.

375
00:18:33,438 --> 00:18:34,918
I've promised to spare some time

376
00:18:34,918 --> 00:18:35,958
for you after the rehearsal.

377
00:18:36,238 --> 00:18:36,838
Alright, then.

378
00:18:37,118 --> 00:18:39,198
I'll meet you at our usual spot.

379
00:18:39,678 --> 00:18:40,518
Okay.

380
00:18:43,558 --> 00:18:45,238
Is this in the script?

381
00:18:45,718 --> 00:18:47,078
Tonight?

382
00:18:47,358 --> 00:18:48,238
At the usual spot?

383
00:18:50,398 --> 00:18:52,438
It's not in the script.

384
00:18:53,318 --> 00:18:54,078
What do they mean?

385
00:18:54,078 --> 00:18:55,638
Why do they change the lines?

386
00:18:56,198 --> 00:18:59,438
It looks like they're pretty close.

387
00:19:02,638 --> 00:19:04,078
What do they mean?

388
00:19:09,158 --> 00:19:09,798
Oh god.

389
00:19:10,118 --> 00:19:11,518
Is something going on between them?

390
00:19:12,038 --> 00:19:12,918
Lin Xi.

391
00:19:12,918 --> 00:19:13,398
Lin...

392
00:19:22,020 --> 00:19:23,510
(Academic Building)

393
00:19:23,518 --> 00:19:24,478
This is infuriating me.

394
00:19:24,918 --> 00:19:25,958
It's too outrageous.

395
00:19:26,278 --> 00:19:27,758
I even trusted Ji Junxing.

396
00:19:28,038 --> 00:19:28,758
I should've torn

397
00:19:28,758 --> 00:19:29,678
them apart just now.

398
00:19:32,598 --> 00:19:33,598
I think Shakespeare did well

399
00:19:33,598 --> 00:19:34,398
in writing that part.

400
00:19:35,198 --> 00:19:36,758
How can you think
of Shakespeare at a time like this?

401
00:19:37,958 --> 00:19:39,158
He might've had feelings

402
00:19:39,758 --> 00:19:42,518
for me when he was a kid.

403
00:19:43,518 --> 00:19:44,638
But he's a grownup now.

404
00:19:45,518 --> 00:19:46,958
He's seen a bigger world

405
00:19:48,758 --> 00:19:49,998
and found someone he really likes.

406
00:19:52,238 --> 00:19:53,158
He has my blessing.

407
00:19:54,238 --> 00:19:55,478
You give him your blessing?

408
00:19:59,398 --> 00:20:00,318
I've come around.

409
00:20:01,398 --> 00:20:02,678
I've lost a tree

410
00:20:02,958 --> 00:20:05,038
but there's a forest awaiting me.

411
00:20:07,038 --> 00:20:08,278
Well said.

412
00:20:08,798 --> 00:20:10,278
Come to think of it,
the same goes for me.

413
00:20:10,758 --> 00:20:11,918
I'll suffer a great loss

414
00:20:11,918 --> 00:20:13,478
if I stay attached to a bad guy

415
00:20:13,478 --> 00:20:14,558
like Xie Ang.

416
00:20:15,598 --> 00:20:17,518
I'll take you
to a single mixer tomorrow.

417
00:20:17,838 --> 00:20:18,358
Let's go.

418
00:20:24,038 --> 00:20:24,878
Speed dating event.

419
00:20:24,878 --> 00:20:25,398
Do not

420
00:20:25,398 --> 00:20:25,998
miss out.

421
00:20:25,998 --> 00:20:26,998
Mate, scan the code and follow us.

422
00:20:26,998 --> 00:20:28,238
You'll get a small gift.

423
00:20:28,478 --> 00:20:29,358
It's only RMB 99.9.

424
00:20:29,358 --> 00:20:30,078
Take a look.

425
00:20:30,078 --> 00:20:30,758
It's only RMB 99.9?

426
00:20:30,758 --> 00:20:31,558
Yes, RMB 99.9.

427
00:20:31,558 --> 00:20:32,518
The drinks are all free of charge.

428
00:20:32,518 --> 00:20:33,158
Are you interested?

429
00:20:33,158 --> 00:20:33,918
Scan the QR code.

430
00:20:33,918 --> 00:20:35,038
Sure, we'll join it.

431
00:20:35,038 --> 00:20:35,518
We'll go back and scan it.

432
00:20:35,518 --> 00:20:35,838
Okay.

433
00:20:35,838 --> 00:20:36,478
Thank you.

434
00:20:36,478 --> 00:20:36,798
Mate,

435
00:20:36,798 --> 00:20:37,958
this is a speed dating event.

436
00:20:37,958 --> 00:20:38,718
It's only RMB 99.9.

437
00:20:38,718 --> 00:20:39,598
You'll get a gift
if you scan the code and follow us.

438
00:20:39,598 --> 00:20:40,638
The drinks are free of charge.

439
00:20:42,278 --> 00:20:43,558
Do you hold the speed dating event?

440
00:20:44,198 --> 00:20:44,958
Yes.

441
00:20:44,958 --> 00:20:45,758
Where there's gold,

442
00:20:45,758 --> 00:20:47,198
I'll be there.

443
00:20:48,158 --> 00:20:48,918
Perfect.

444
00:20:48,918 --> 00:20:49,918
We're acquaintances.

445
00:20:50,198 --> 00:20:50,998
How should I pay you?

446
00:20:52,198 --> 00:20:53,038
You've come around.

447
00:20:53,478 --> 00:20:54,478
You want to make up with me?

448
00:20:54,958 --> 00:20:56,038
This is the right choice to make.

449
00:20:56,318 --> 00:20:57,638
How nice it is to come back
and be the boss lady.

450
00:20:58,318 --> 00:20:59,398
You've thought too much.

451
00:20:59,398 --> 00:21:00,358
I'm here to register.

452
00:21:00,998 --> 00:21:01,798
You want to join the event?

453
00:21:02,238 --> 00:21:02,838
Yes.

454
00:21:02,838 --> 00:21:03,478
Can't I do that?

455
00:21:03,758 --> 00:21:04,518
You can't.

456
00:21:04,798 --> 00:21:06,118
This is the event for those

457
00:21:06,118 --> 00:21:06,918
who are single.

458
00:21:06,918 --> 00:21:08,038
Are you single?

459
00:21:08,038 --> 00:21:09,158
I am.

460
00:21:09,518 --> 00:21:11,518
If you don't like this claim,

461
00:21:11,518 --> 00:21:13,078
you can take me as a widow.

462
00:21:13,078 --> 00:21:13,558
You...

463
00:21:15,118 --> 00:21:15,678
Fine.

464
00:21:15,998 --> 00:21:16,838
Go ahead and join it.

465
00:21:16,838 --> 00:21:17,918
You'll still be single after that.

466
00:21:18,318 --> 00:21:19,398
Not quite.

467
00:21:20,638 --> 00:21:21,518
I'll transfer the money to you.

468
00:21:21,518 --> 00:21:22,518
It's for me and Lin Xi.

469
00:21:22,518 --> 00:21:23,078
RMB 200 in total.

470
00:21:23,358 --> 00:21:24,518
Keep the change

471
00:21:25,438 --> 00:21:26,358
as your reward.

472
00:21:26,558 --> 00:21:27,398
Lin Xi is going too?

473
00:21:27,718 --> 00:21:28,438
Yes.

474
00:21:29,518 --> 00:21:30,598
Are you out of your mind?

475
00:21:31,518 --> 00:21:33,278
All of you are insane!

476
00:21:45,838 --> 00:21:46,678
What's the matter?

477
00:21:46,678 --> 00:21:47,598
Why the long face?

478
00:21:49,518 --> 00:21:51,398
Do you want to find
your best friend in life,

479
00:21:51,398 --> 00:21:52,038
business partner

480
00:21:52,598 --> 00:21:53,438
and soulmate?

481
00:21:54,558 --> 00:21:55,238
No, thanks.

482
00:21:55,718 --> 00:21:56,278
Maybe your soulmate

483
00:21:56,278 --> 00:21:57,318
is at my speed dating event.

484
00:21:57,838 --> 00:21:58,718
That's impossible.

485
00:21:59,638 --> 00:22:00,638
Lin Xi has signed up for it.

486
00:22:03,398 --> 00:22:04,238
Four in this afternoon.

487
00:22:04,558 --> 00:22:05,518
Don't say that I didn't tell you.

488
00:22:17,758 --> 00:22:18,278
Sorry.

489
00:22:18,278 --> 00:22:18,878
It's under decoration.

490
00:22:18,878 --> 00:22:19,918
You can take a rest over there.

491
00:22:19,918 --> 00:22:20,598
Sure.

492
00:22:23,198 --> 00:22:24,558
Can the three of you move faster?

493
00:22:24,558 --> 00:22:25,598
We have guests here.

494
00:22:26,318 --> 00:22:27,398
Got it.

495
00:22:28,478 --> 00:22:29,678
It's another day for us

496
00:22:29,678 --> 00:22:30,958
to be Xie Ang's slaves.

497
00:22:31,438 --> 00:22:32,718
Well, do you think he can make

498
00:22:32,718 --> 00:22:33,558
money out of it?

499
00:22:33,918 --> 00:22:35,518
I don't know that.

500
00:22:36,318 --> 00:22:37,238
But it feels like

501
00:22:37,598 --> 00:22:39,238
he's known most of the students.

502
00:22:42,398 --> 00:22:43,358
This way, please.

503
00:22:43,358 --> 00:22:43,678
Well,

504
00:22:43,678 --> 00:22:44,878
you can get your number
at the reception.

505
00:22:44,878 --> 00:22:46,078
And the drinks are self-service.

506
00:22:46,558 --> 00:22:47,078
Hello.

507
00:22:47,078 --> 00:22:47,918
The speed dating event is over here.

508
00:22:48,638 --> 00:22:50,078
May I verify your names?

509
00:22:50,918 --> 00:22:52,278
Shi Hao and Li Le, right?

510
00:22:52,278 --> 00:22:53,078
Okay. This way, please.

511
00:22:53,078 --> 00:22:53,478
Well,

512
00:22:53,478 --> 00:22:54,398
you can get your number
at the reception.

513
00:22:54,398 --> 00:22:55,758
And the drinks are self-service.

514
00:22:57,678 --> 00:22:58,158
Senior,

515
00:22:58,158 --> 00:22:58,958
you're here.

516
00:22:59,478 --> 00:23:00,078
Senior,

517
00:23:00,078 --> 00:23:01,078
what do you think about the app

518
00:23:01,078 --> 00:23:01,678
I mentioned?

519
00:23:02,278 --> 00:23:03,238
I'll think about it.

520
00:23:03,238 --> 00:23:03,758
Sure, no problem.

521
00:23:03,758 --> 00:23:04,358
This way, please.

522
00:23:04,358 --> 00:23:04,678
Okay.

523
00:23:04,678 --> 00:23:05,118
You can get the number

524
00:23:05,118 --> 00:23:05,878
at the reception.

525
00:23:05,878 --> 00:23:06,958
The drinks are self-service.

526
00:23:21,158 --> 00:23:22,878
Lin Xi even came to join
the speed dating event.

527
00:23:22,878 --> 00:23:23,918
Why don't you go and coax her?

528
00:23:24,838 --> 00:23:26,118
Why don't you go and coax Jiang Yimian?

529
00:23:26,438 --> 00:23:27,238
Just let her be.

530
00:23:27,878 --> 00:23:30,038
Let her see those bad guys out there.

531
00:23:30,038 --> 00:23:30,918
She'll only realize how good I am.

532
00:23:33,238 --> 00:23:33,838
Hello.

533
00:23:34,398 --> 00:23:34,798
Hello.

534
00:23:34,798 --> 00:23:35,358
Can I sit here?

535
00:23:35,678 --> 00:23:36,358
Sure.

536
00:23:36,718 --> 00:23:37,278
Thank you.

537
00:23:37,278 --> 00:23:38,238
Aren't you worried

538
00:23:38,478 --> 00:23:40,678
that she'll meet her soulmate?

539
00:23:41,718 --> 00:23:42,718
With the bad temperament of hers,

540
00:23:42,718 --> 00:23:43,718
who can take it?

541
00:23:44,718 --> 00:23:45,958
I don't think so.

542
00:23:46,638 --> 00:23:47,718
Which department are you from?

543
00:23:47,878 --> 00:23:49,238
I'm from the Department of Journalism.

544
00:23:49,238 --> 00:23:49,918
And you?

545
00:23:50,318 --> 00:23:50,998
I'm from the Department of Finance.

546
00:23:51,358 --> 00:23:52,598
She's just pretending.

547
00:23:52,598 --> 00:23:54,558
I can tell
that this boy is not her cup of tea.

548
00:24:00,318 --> 00:24:01,078
Are you sure?

549
00:24:01,718 --> 00:24:02,438
Of course.

550
00:24:02,958 --> 00:24:04,518
Jiang Yimian's favorite drink is Cola.

551
00:24:04,518 --> 00:24:06,078
She hates orange juice the most.

552
00:24:06,438 --> 00:24:09,638
This boy is out in 3s.

553
00:24:15,198 --> 00:24:17,078
I think you're the one who's out.

554
00:24:21,358 --> 00:24:22,438
It's not done yet.

555
00:24:27,358 --> 00:24:28,478
Here's some fruit for you.

556
00:24:33,398 --> 00:24:34,358
Just ignore him.

557
00:24:34,478 --> 00:24:35,758
What are they talking about?

558
00:24:36,758 --> 00:24:37,558
I don't know.

559
00:24:37,558 --> 00:24:38,958
It feels like they're hitting it off.

560
00:24:39,478 --> 00:24:40,918
I like to play chess too.

561
00:24:41,718 --> 00:24:42,958
Chess, my foot.

562
00:24:42,958 --> 00:24:44,078
I guess it's Flying Chess.

563
00:24:51,198 --> 00:24:52,558
Let's play together when you're free.

564
00:24:53,398 --> 00:24:55,438
But I'm not very good at it.

565
00:24:55,438 --> 00:24:56,598
I'm afraid you'll make fun of me.

566
00:24:57,278 --> 00:24:58,118
It's alright.

567
00:24:58,118 --> 00:24:58,758
I can teach you.

568
00:24:59,158 --> 00:25:00,158
Sure.

569
00:25:00,158 --> 00:25:01,678
You can add me on WeChat.

570
00:25:06,358 --> 00:25:07,038
Excuse me.

571
00:25:07,878 --> 00:25:08,798
This is my girlfriend.

572
00:25:10,198 --> 00:25:10,918
What are you doing?

573
00:25:17,918 --> 00:25:18,838
What's wrong with you?

574
00:25:19,558 --> 00:25:20,118
Let go.

575
00:25:20,558 --> 00:25:21,638
Let go of me!

576
00:25:21,878 --> 00:25:22,638
What am I doing?

577
00:25:22,638 --> 00:25:23,718
I should ask you that.

578
00:25:23,718 --> 00:25:24,438
If I was late,

579
00:25:24,438 --> 00:25:25,798
you would've added him on WeChat.

580
00:25:25,798 --> 00:25:27,038
I'm here to make friends.

581
00:25:27,038 --> 00:25:27,998
What's wrong with that?

582
00:25:27,998 --> 00:25:29,158
It depends on who it is.

583
00:25:29,478 --> 00:25:30,718
Obviously, he is a boring guy.

584
00:25:30,998 --> 00:25:31,838
You're not boring at all.

585
00:25:31,838 --> 00:25:33,118
You make friends all around.

586
00:25:33,118 --> 00:25:34,238
You're eager to make

587
00:25:34,238 --> 00:25:35,558
everyone at school your clients.

588
00:25:35,558 --> 00:25:36,718
What's so good
about being a sociable person?

589
00:25:37,078 --> 00:25:37,798
You're mad

590
00:25:37,798 --> 00:25:38,998
because I stood you up last time.

591
00:25:38,998 --> 00:25:39,558
Don't you want

592
00:25:39,558 --> 00:25:39,998
to know

593
00:25:39,998 --> 00:25:41,198
I work all day for what?

594
00:25:41,518 --> 00:25:42,518
What else could it be?

595
00:25:42,518 --> 00:25:43,598
It's for money.

596
00:25:43,718 --> 00:25:44,798
Your name shouldn't be Xie Ang.

597
00:25:44,798 --> 00:25:46,238
It should be Money-Loving Xie.

598
00:25:46,678 --> 00:25:47,198
Yes.

599
00:25:47,518 --> 00:25:48,518
I want to make money

600
00:25:49,038 --> 00:25:50,558
because I want to take you
to the music festival.

601
00:25:54,838 --> 00:25:55,958
It's just to coax me.

602
00:25:55,958 --> 00:25:56,838
I don't believe you.

603
00:25:58,718 --> 00:25:59,278
Fine.

604
00:26:01,398 --> 00:26:02,718
I've booked the ticket, the flight

605
00:26:02,718 --> 00:26:03,198
and the hotel.

606
00:26:03,198 --> 00:26:03,998
See for yourself.

607
00:26:18,438 --> 00:26:19,558
I took you to a fake one.

608
00:26:20,518 --> 00:26:21,638
I want to make things right this time.

609
00:26:23,038 --> 00:26:24,158
To take you to a real one.

610
00:26:27,238 --> 00:26:28,758
Am I dreaming?

611
00:26:29,358 --> 00:26:30,638
Did you really buy all these?

612
00:26:31,718 --> 00:26:32,478
Of course.

613
00:26:33,158 --> 00:26:33,918
Every day after school,

614
00:26:33,918 --> 00:26:35,678
I worked three part-time jobs
to make the money.

615
00:26:35,678 --> 00:26:37,438
I was going to give it to you
on your birthday.

616
00:26:38,118 --> 00:26:39,638
Why are you making a fuss?

617
00:26:40,758 --> 00:26:42,038
I work so hard because of you.

618
00:26:42,678 --> 00:26:43,678
But you came to this mixer

619
00:26:44,158 --> 00:26:45,638
and talked to the other guy.

620
00:26:46,878 --> 00:26:47,918
I'm deeply hurt.

621
00:26:59,078 --> 00:26:59,798
Okay.

622
00:27:00,438 --> 00:27:01,598
I've misjudged you.

623
00:27:02,158 --> 00:27:03,118
You're the only one I like.

624
00:27:03,518 --> 00:27:04,358
Okay?

625
00:27:08,878 --> 00:27:10,918
Don't be mad.

626
00:27:11,358 --> 00:27:12,518
Xie Ang.

627
00:27:21,558 --> 00:27:22,438
Are we cool?

628
00:27:23,718 --> 00:27:24,438
Yes.

629
00:27:26,358 --> 00:27:27,358
One more kiss.

630
00:27:38,958 --> 00:27:39,838
Well, I'll go get a fruit plate.

631
00:27:40,558 --> 00:27:41,518
I'll go get the drinks.

632
00:27:43,198 --> 00:27:44,518
You guys continue.

633
00:27:59,678 --> 00:28:00,558
Xi,

634
00:28:01,158 --> 00:28:02,318
I'm sorry.

635
00:28:02,318 --> 00:28:03,918
I invited you over but I stood you up.

636
00:28:04,318 --> 00:28:05,558
You're on your own

637
00:28:05,558 --> 00:28:07,198
for the rest of the day.

638
00:28:08,678 --> 00:28:10,438
I saw it already.

639
00:28:10,438 --> 00:28:11,678
Just go and be the boss lady.

640
00:28:12,558 --> 00:28:14,158
I didn't betray you on purpose.

641
00:28:14,398 --> 00:28:15,598
I didn't know he's busy working

642
00:28:15,598 --> 00:28:16,958
just to buy me tickets.

643
00:28:17,358 --> 00:28:18,838
For the sake of art,

644
00:28:19,078 --> 00:28:20,118
I decided to forgive him.

645
00:28:20,118 --> 00:28:20,918
It's alright.

646
00:28:21,398 --> 00:28:22,918
You're attached to Xie Ang.

647
00:28:22,918 --> 00:28:23,958
You guys won't break up easily.

648
00:28:26,758 --> 00:28:29,718
What about you and Ji Junxing?

649
00:28:33,798 --> 00:28:34,718
We're different.

650
00:28:35,758 --> 00:28:37,078
Xie Ang told me

651
00:28:37,078 --> 00:28:37,958
that he came

652
00:28:37,958 --> 00:28:38,878
because of you.

653
00:29:04,998 --> 00:29:06,358
It's quite nice.

654
00:29:08,798 --> 00:29:09,918
Who is this guy?

655
00:29:14,878 --> 00:29:16,038
Shen Pengyu,

656
00:29:16,398 --> 00:29:17,758
the talent
from Jinghua's Department of Finance.

657
00:29:17,758 --> 00:29:19,118
He's professional and well-connected.

658
00:29:19,118 --> 00:29:21,078
He's quite famous in start-up circles.

659
00:29:21,358 --> 00:29:22,798
He's also good at piano,
chess and drawing.

660
00:29:23,078 --> 00:29:24,398
He's a lady killer for sure.

661
00:29:24,718 --> 00:29:26,118
He plays the piano pretty well.

662
00:29:26,518 --> 00:29:27,718
But it feels like he's pretentious.

663
00:29:28,278 --> 00:29:29,438
It's not only that.

664
00:29:29,438 --> 00:29:30,398
He's also a playboy.

665
00:29:30,718 --> 00:29:31,678
You know him?

666
00:29:31,678 --> 00:29:33,278
I used to follow his Weibo.

667
00:29:33,558 --> 00:29:35,438
He always hits on the fangirls
on the internet.

668
00:29:35,838 --> 00:29:37,118
He even sent a personal message to me.

669
00:29:37,798 --> 00:29:38,838
He doesn't deserve such a face.

670
00:29:39,158 --> 00:29:40,438
It turns out he's a scoundrel.

671
00:29:51,118 --> 00:29:52,318
- Well play.
- Well play.

672
00:29:54,318 --> 00:29:55,798
This Canon is dedicated to the girl

673
00:29:55,798 --> 00:29:57,758
in the beret
who's sitting at the corner.

674
00:29:59,798 --> 00:30:01,318
Because you're as elegant

675
00:30:01,598 --> 00:30:03,398
and pure as Canon.

676
00:30:05,598 --> 00:30:06,438
Lin Xi,

677
00:30:06,758 --> 00:30:08,078
it sounds like you.

678
00:30:10,358 --> 00:30:11,678
Well, give it a try.

679
00:30:11,678 --> 00:30:12,998
I'll go to Xie Ang first.

680
00:30:16,758 --> 00:30:18,558
Is he going to lay hand on Lin Xi?

681
00:30:21,998 --> 00:30:22,878
What are you doing?

682
00:30:24,718 --> 00:30:25,838
I'm in this dating event.

683
00:30:29,158 --> 00:30:30,998
I've watched you for so long.

684
00:30:30,998 --> 00:30:32,798
I didn't expect you to be
one of the participants.

685
00:30:33,278 --> 00:30:34,478
May I know who you are?

686
00:30:35,318 --> 00:30:36,598
Sorry, I'm busy.

687
00:30:36,838 --> 00:30:38,038
Come on, let's get acquainted.

688
00:30:38,038 --> 00:30:39,078
Do you like the song

689
00:30:39,238 --> 00:30:40,318
I played for you?

690
00:30:41,318 --> 00:30:41,918
It's nice.

691
00:30:41,918 --> 00:30:42,798
Thank you.

692
00:30:43,678 --> 00:30:45,798
Well, can I sit here?

693
00:30:47,638 --> 00:30:48,318
Sure.

694
00:30:48,558 --> 00:30:49,198
Thank you.

695
00:30:52,278 --> 00:30:53,718
You're from the Drama Club, aren't you?

696
00:30:54,078 --> 00:30:56,478
I've seen you in "Hamlet".

697
00:30:56,478 --> 00:30:57,798
You're so handsome.

698
00:30:58,718 --> 00:30:59,158
Thank you.

699
00:30:59,918 --> 00:31:03,358
Besides attending
classes and rehearsals,

700
00:31:03,758 --> 00:31:05,798
what do you like to do when you're free?

701
00:31:07,518 --> 00:31:09,318
Try the Boston Cream Pie
of this restaurant.

702
00:31:09,318 --> 00:31:10,038
It tastes nice.

703
00:31:15,278 --> 00:31:16,478
She even eats the cake?

704
00:31:17,158 --> 00:31:18,438
You like cakes?

705
00:31:18,878 --> 00:31:19,758
You try this.

706
00:31:19,758 --> 00:31:20,398
No, it's alright.

707
00:31:20,398 --> 00:31:22,598
Black Forest is my favorite flavor.

708
00:31:28,718 --> 00:31:29,558
Sorry.

709
00:31:29,878 --> 00:31:30,558
I'd like to have milk tea.

710
00:31:30,558 --> 00:31:31,398
I'll get going.

711
00:31:33,398 --> 00:31:33,798
Sorry.

712
00:31:33,798 --> 00:31:34,998
I've got to go.

713
00:31:35,438 --> 00:31:36,238
Milk tea?

714
00:31:37,038 --> 00:31:37,878
I can make it.

715
00:31:43,078 --> 00:31:44,638
There's no milk and tea here.

716
00:31:44,638 --> 00:31:45,358
How to make it?

717
00:31:48,518 --> 00:31:50,838
The combination of Wangzai Milk
and Baileys Irish Cream.

718
00:31:52,398 --> 00:31:54,518
It tastes just like mixed milk tea.

719
00:31:58,318 --> 00:31:58,958
Try it.

720
00:32:13,798 --> 00:32:14,878
It tastes alike.

721
00:32:15,358 --> 00:32:16,118
Not bad.

722
00:32:17,718 --> 00:32:20,158
I wonder if I have the chance to watch

723
00:32:20,598 --> 00:32:21,838
the sunrise with you.

724
00:32:23,038 --> 00:32:25,318
I'll make you a milk tea series,

725
00:32:25,918 --> 00:32:26,718
Sunrise.

726
00:32:44,758 --> 00:32:47,478
This tastes
like the first ray of sunshine.

727
00:32:48,398 --> 00:32:49,438
The flavor is mild.

728
00:32:49,838 --> 00:32:50,678
You can try it.

729
00:33:02,038 --> 00:33:03,158
It's quite sweet.

730
00:33:04,438 --> 00:33:06,198
But I recommend you

731
00:33:06,638 --> 00:33:07,958
to drink it all at once.

732
00:33:19,718 --> 00:33:20,838
This is

733
00:33:21,558 --> 00:33:22,678
a little stronger.

734
00:33:22,678 --> 00:33:23,758
You can drink it slowly.

735
00:33:25,038 --> 00:33:25,918
It's alright.

736
00:33:30,118 --> 00:33:31,038
It's quite strong.

737
00:33:31,438 --> 00:33:32,238
And it's choking.

738
00:33:32,478 --> 00:33:32,998
Ji Junxing,

739
00:33:32,998 --> 00:33:33,878
what are you doing?

740
00:33:35,518 --> 00:33:37,078
It's not much fun to see you two drink.

741
00:33:37,718 --> 00:33:38,558
Let me make one.

742
00:33:39,358 --> 00:33:39,998
Please.

743
00:34:02,318 --> 00:34:03,438
This is called Sunset.

744
00:34:03,798 --> 00:34:04,558
The dusk.

745
00:34:04,958 --> 00:34:05,518
Try it.

746
00:34:07,398 --> 00:34:07,998
Ji Junxing,

747
00:34:07,998 --> 00:34:09,678
he made milk tea for me out of kindness.

748
00:34:09,678 --> 00:34:09,878
You...

749
00:34:09,878 --> 00:34:11,238
He made a lot of drinks for you.

750
00:34:11,518 --> 00:34:13,078
What's wrong with me making him a drink?

751
00:34:13,078 --> 00:34:13,678
No.

752
00:34:13,918 --> 00:34:14,878
It's alright.

753
00:34:15,558 --> 00:34:16,438
He meant well.

754
00:34:16,958 --> 00:34:17,558
I'll drink it.

755
00:34:24,718 --> 00:34:25,238
How is it?

756
00:34:25,558 --> 00:34:26,598
How does it taste?

757
00:34:28,198 --> 00:34:29,198
It tastes good.

758
00:34:29,878 --> 00:34:30,478
Drink up.

759
00:34:31,638 --> 00:34:32,398
We should drink

760
00:34:34,958 --> 00:34:36,838
the wine, sip by sip,
to enjoy the taste.

761
00:34:37,718 --> 00:34:39,958
It'll taste better to drink it
all at once.

762
00:34:56,878 --> 00:34:57,478
Fine.

763
00:34:58,318 --> 00:34:59,238
I'll let you slide this time.

764
00:35:08,758 --> 00:35:09,838
You don't even know

765
00:35:10,358 --> 00:35:11,358
you're being taken advantage of.

766
00:35:22,718 --> 00:35:23,718
Are you alright?

767
00:35:24,798 --> 00:35:25,798
Who are you?

768
00:35:27,038 --> 00:35:28,158
I'm Ji Junxing.

769
00:35:28,158 --> 00:35:29,398
A hermit crab?

770
00:35:30,958 --> 00:35:32,118
Ji Junxing.

771
00:35:32,878 --> 00:35:34,078
Ji Buxing?

772
00:35:35,118 --> 00:35:36,518
I'm Ji Junxing.

773
00:35:38,798 --> 00:35:39,598
I know.

774
00:35:40,398 --> 00:35:41,998
You're a liar.

775
00:35:42,238 --> 00:35:43,398
A liar!

776
00:35:43,878 --> 00:35:45,078
Put me down.

777
00:35:48,678 --> 00:35:49,718
What did he lie to you?

778
00:35:51,198 --> 00:35:52,278
Have you heard

779
00:35:53,398 --> 00:35:55,678
of the story about a fox and a rabbit?

780
00:35:55,878 --> 00:35:56,798
What is it about?

781
00:35:58,118 --> 00:36:01,558
Once upon a time, there was a fox

782
00:36:01,998 --> 00:36:04,358
and a rabbit.
They went to hiking together.

783
00:36:05,838 --> 00:36:08,718
When they were hiking,

784
00:36:09,798 --> 00:36:10,838
all of a sudden,

785
00:36:14,398 --> 00:36:15,238
the fox fell down.

786
00:36:17,118 --> 00:36:18,238
The rabbit said

787
00:36:19,238 --> 00:36:21,518
I'll wait for you at the peak.

788
00:36:22,478 --> 00:36:26,878
The fox worked so hard
and spent a year climbing the hill.

789
00:36:28,438 --> 00:36:30,038
She finally made it to the peak.

790
00:36:32,358 --> 00:36:33,238
Yet,

791
00:36:36,358 --> 00:36:39,878
the rabbit didn't wait for her.

792
00:36:52,238 --> 00:36:53,158
Then, do you know

793
00:36:53,598 --> 00:36:55,198
how the rabbit spent the year?

794
00:36:59,878 --> 00:37:01,038
How?

795
00:37:02,918 --> 00:37:04,318
The rabbit went to the peak on his own.

796
00:37:05,638 --> 00:37:06,678
His best hope was

797
00:37:07,358 --> 00:37:08,958
a phone call once a month.

798
00:37:09,918 --> 00:37:10,878
His biggest fear was

799
00:37:12,638 --> 00:37:14,558
the long and agonizing waiting

800
00:37:15,398 --> 00:37:17,878
after every phone call.

801
00:37:19,958 --> 00:37:21,758
He thought the outcome was

802
00:37:22,838 --> 00:37:24,558
that they could be together in the end.

803
00:37:27,078 --> 00:37:28,038
Unexpectedly,

804
00:37:31,598 --> 00:37:33,438
the fox suddenly disappeared.

805
00:37:34,038 --> 00:37:35,598
I didn't disappear.

806
00:37:36,478 --> 00:37:38,118
All of us have changed.

807
00:37:38,118 --> 00:37:39,158
I didn't.

808
00:37:39,438 --> 00:37:40,958
I've always wanted to be with you.

809
00:37:47,638 --> 00:37:48,358
Yes.

810
00:37:52,678 --> 00:37:53,798
So do I.

811
00:37:55,998 --> 00:37:58,798
But I don't like him anymore.

812
00:38:09,598 --> 00:38:10,318
Take this.

813
00:38:12,958 --> 00:38:14,238
You can have it back.

814
00:38:16,598 --> 00:38:17,598
I don't want it anymore.

815
00:38:23,678 --> 00:38:24,638
I don't want you anymore.
