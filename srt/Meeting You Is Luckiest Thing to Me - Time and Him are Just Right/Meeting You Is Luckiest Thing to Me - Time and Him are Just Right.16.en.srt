=Episode 16=

17
00:01:40,259 --> 00:01:41,379
I got it.

18
00:01:41,379 --> 00:01:42,579
Thank you, Chen.

19
00:01:43,139 --> 00:01:45,139
The materials you reminded us to prepare

20
00:01:45,459 --> 00:01:46,859
are proceeding smoothly.

21
00:01:47,379 --> 00:01:48,059
Yes.

22
00:01:48,059 --> 00:01:50,379
Now, we're just waiting
for the school to reopen.

23
00:01:52,939 --> 00:01:53,499
Okay.

24
00:01:54,219 --> 00:01:54,979
Chen,

25
00:01:55,499 --> 00:01:57,939
be sure to make time for this Saturday.

26
00:01:57,939 --> 00:02:00,259
You must come to the dinner.

27
00:02:00,899 --> 00:02:01,779
Sure.

28
00:02:01,779 --> 00:02:02,899
Well, it's a deal.

29
00:02:05,899 --> 00:02:06,819
Junxing,

30
00:02:06,819 --> 00:02:08,419
you've done a great job this time.

31
00:02:08,419 --> 00:02:09,819
You must keep it up.

32
00:02:09,819 --> 00:02:12,699
If you have time, study the related
materials of the business course

33
00:02:12,699 --> 00:02:13,779
in advance.

34
00:02:14,379 --> 00:02:15,019
Dad,

35
00:02:15,779 --> 00:02:17,619
actually, I don't want
to study business.

36
00:02:18,459 --> 00:02:20,019
I want to study Computer Science.

37
00:02:20,019 --> 00:02:20,899
Computer Science?

38
00:02:22,019 --> 00:02:24,379
I know you've always loved programming.

39
00:02:25,299 --> 00:02:27,179
But why didn't you tell me
when you chose

40
00:02:27,179 --> 00:02:28,219
the major?

41
00:02:28,819 --> 00:02:30,619
I've just made the decision recently.

42
00:02:32,219 --> 00:02:33,059
I'd like to turn

43
00:02:33,059 --> 00:02:34,659
my hobby into my future career.

44
00:02:36,579 --> 00:02:39,299
Computer Science has
a good prospect as well.

45
00:02:40,139 --> 00:02:41,499
If you really want to study it,

46
00:02:41,499 --> 00:02:43,299
you can change your major later.

47
00:02:43,739 --> 00:02:45,459
It's troublesome to change major.

48
00:02:45,459 --> 00:02:46,899
Besides, it doesn't necessarily work.

49
00:02:47,539 --> 00:02:49,059
Didn't you win the gold medal

50
00:02:49,059 --> 00:02:50,459
for International Olympiad
in Informatics before?

51
00:02:50,459 --> 00:02:52,139
I suppose it'll be a plus.

52
00:02:53,019 --> 00:02:54,939
Actually, there's a simpler solution.

53
00:02:55,179 --> 00:02:56,099
With the gold medal,

54
00:02:56,099 --> 00:02:57,859
I'll be recommended for admission
to the Jinghua University.

55
00:02:59,299 --> 00:03:00,619
You're saying

56
00:03:01,019 --> 00:03:02,339
that you don't want to go to NIT?

57
00:03:04,179 --> 00:03:04,859
Yes.

58
00:03:05,419 --> 00:03:06,739
I want to stay in China.

59
00:03:07,259 --> 00:03:08,419
Besides, Jinghua University

60
00:03:08,419 --> 00:03:10,419
ranks high internationally
in Computer Science.

61
00:03:10,419 --> 00:03:12,699
There'll be more chances in China
than in foreign countries in the future.

62
00:03:14,179 --> 00:03:15,499
You can come back

63
00:03:15,499 --> 00:03:16,859
after graduation.

64
00:03:17,899 --> 00:03:20,019
But I went to Jinghua University once.

65
00:03:20,019 --> 00:03:21,699
I like the environment

66
00:03:21,699 --> 00:03:23,059
and the atmosphere.

67
00:03:23,659 --> 00:03:24,499
Therefore,

68
00:03:25,459 --> 00:03:26,819
I'd like to study at Jinghua University.

69
00:03:27,179 --> 00:03:30,059
Lin Xi said she wanted to go
to Jinghua University.

70
00:03:30,459 --> 00:03:31,659
It's because of her, isn't it?

71
00:03:34,059 --> 00:03:35,739
I'll reply to the confirmation email

72
00:03:35,739 --> 00:03:37,019
from NIT for you.

73
00:03:37,019 --> 00:03:39,219
Don't think about it anymore.

74
00:03:39,219 --> 00:03:40,499
This is my future.

75
00:03:40,499 --> 00:03:42,179
I think I have the right
to make decisions.

76
00:03:42,539 --> 00:03:44,739
But you can't make the best decision.

77
00:03:44,739 --> 00:03:46,379
Then, what is the best decision?

78
00:03:46,379 --> 00:03:48,579
Everything we give you is the best.

79
00:03:50,179 --> 00:03:51,299
I don't think so.

80
00:03:51,299 --> 00:03:52,339
What do you mean?

81
00:04:05,699 --> 00:04:06,419
It's me.

82
00:04:40,539 --> 00:04:41,499
What is this?

83
00:04:41,499 --> 00:04:42,899
What is the drawing on the blackboard?

84
00:04:42,899 --> 00:04:44,259
This is an aspiration tree.

85
00:04:44,259 --> 00:04:46,139
Write your desired college
on a piece of paper

86
00:04:46,139 --> 00:04:46,939
and stick on it.

87
00:04:47,299 --> 00:04:48,059
Where do you want to go?

88
00:04:48,539 --> 00:04:49,019
I...

89
00:04:49,019 --> 00:04:50,179
I want to stay local.

90
00:04:50,179 --> 00:04:50,659
It's near my home.

91
00:04:50,659 --> 00:04:51,899
Why are you so unambitious?

92
00:04:51,899 --> 00:04:53,539
Live not just a desultory life,

93
00:04:53,539 --> 00:04:54,779
and open arms
to poems and distant lands.

94
00:04:54,779 --> 00:04:55,699
Xie Ang,

95
00:04:55,699 --> 00:04:57,299
which college do you plan to attend?

96
00:04:58,539 --> 00:04:59,379
Jinghua University.

97
00:04:59,859 --> 00:05:01,379
As your scores have always fluctuated,

98
00:05:01,379 --> 00:05:02,619
I might be able to go to NIT

99
00:05:02,619 --> 00:05:04,339
if you could get admitted
to Jinghua University.

100
00:05:05,499 --> 00:05:06,739
What's so funny?

101
00:05:07,139 --> 00:05:08,299
Are you guys done?

102
00:05:08,299 --> 00:05:09,219
Come.

103
00:05:09,219 --> 00:05:11,179
I've picked the best spot for you.

104
00:05:11,179 --> 00:05:12,019
Come.

105
00:05:12,019 --> 00:05:14,619
I've written on behalf
of Jingzhou Branch

106
00:05:14,619 --> 00:05:15,379
of East Gate Squad.

107
00:05:15,379 --> 00:05:17,779
Do you think I can get admitted?

108
00:05:17,779 --> 00:05:19,539
It feels like Jinghua University
doesn't approve of me.

109
00:05:19,539 --> 00:05:19,899
You

110
00:05:19,899 --> 00:05:20,979
can do it with the enthusiasm

111
00:05:20,979 --> 00:05:21,939
you have for music.

112
00:05:27,059 --> 00:05:27,899
Ji Junxing,

113
00:05:27,899 --> 00:05:28,899
all that's missing is yours.

114
00:05:39,020 --> 00:05:40,300
(Jinghua University Ji Junxing)

115
00:05:42,339 --> 00:05:43,059
Not bad.

116
00:05:43,339 --> 00:05:44,699
You even saved me the center spot.

117
00:05:46,899 --> 00:05:47,739
Of course.

118
00:05:47,739 --> 00:05:48,619
You're the one having the best chance

119
00:05:48,619 --> 00:05:49,699
to get admitted
to Jinghua University among us.

120
00:05:49,699 --> 00:05:50,899
Look at this.

121
00:05:50,899 --> 00:05:51,979
It's spectacular.

122
00:05:52,699 --> 00:05:55,099
I think it looks like Calabash Brother.

123
00:05:55,099 --> 00:05:56,899
There are six flowers on a vine.

124
00:05:57,859 --> 00:05:58,779
Make ways.

125
00:06:02,539 --> 00:06:03,619
Girls.

126
00:06:04,179 --> 00:06:06,579
The students who join
the intensive training seem to be back.

127
00:06:07,619 --> 00:06:08,659
Let's go.

128
00:06:27,739 --> 00:06:28,659
Qin Kai!

129
00:06:31,259 --> 00:06:31,979
What are you waiting for?

130
00:06:31,979 --> 00:06:33,019
Come down here.

131
00:06:36,979 --> 00:06:38,339
What has happened?

132
00:06:38,619 --> 00:06:40,379
Why is he using a cane?

133
00:06:43,339 --> 00:06:44,659
What's going on?

134
00:06:44,659 --> 00:06:45,539
Slow down.

135
00:06:46,059 --> 00:06:47,219
I'm fine.

136
00:06:49,539 --> 00:06:51,339
When did this happen?

137
00:06:51,659 --> 00:06:52,819
What an odd coincidence.

138
00:06:52,819 --> 00:06:54,139
My very first strain

139
00:06:54,139 --> 00:06:55,899
happened on the sports exam day.

140
00:06:55,899 --> 00:06:57,139
With this physique of mine,

141
00:06:57,139 --> 00:06:58,419
I can go buy a lottery ticket.

142
00:06:58,419 --> 00:06:59,659
What about the result?

143
00:07:00,099 --> 00:07:00,979
I got

144
00:07:01,859 --> 00:07:02,819
a zero score.

145
00:07:03,419 --> 00:07:04,779
What about the college entrance exam?

146
00:07:05,979 --> 00:07:07,219
It's alright.

147
00:07:07,219 --> 00:07:09,219
At worst, I'll just apply
for a random college.

148
00:07:09,219 --> 00:07:12,099
If it doesn't work,
I'll just repeat the grade.

149
00:07:12,099 --> 00:07:13,059
I'll fight again next year.

150
00:07:15,859 --> 00:07:16,539
Right.

151
00:07:16,539 --> 00:07:17,739
Get yourself healed up first.

152
00:07:17,739 --> 00:07:19,379
There'll be more chances
when you recover.

153
00:07:20,659 --> 00:07:22,939
I'm just sorry

154
00:07:23,379 --> 00:07:25,099
that I can't bring you
a better gold medal.

155
00:07:25,539 --> 00:07:26,699
It's alright.

156
00:07:26,699 --> 00:07:27,579
You can get me that later.

157
00:07:28,259 --> 00:07:29,019
Sure.

158
00:07:30,259 --> 00:07:31,219
Qin Kai.

159
00:07:32,619 --> 00:07:33,739
The coach is looking for you.

160
00:07:34,979 --> 00:07:36,059
What's wrong with your leg?

161
00:07:36,059 --> 00:07:37,059
I'm injured.

162
00:07:37,059 --> 00:07:38,019
Where is your luggage?

163
00:07:38,019 --> 00:07:38,779
Over there.

164
00:07:38,779 --> 00:07:39,499
The blue one.

165
00:07:41,859 --> 00:07:43,019
I'll get going.

166
00:07:43,019 --> 00:07:43,659
Okay.

167
00:07:43,659 --> 00:07:44,379
Bye bye.

168
00:07:44,539 --> 00:07:45,259
Bye bye.

169
00:08:00,899 --> 00:08:01,939
What's the matter?

170
00:08:03,299 --> 00:08:05,019
Why does Monilaria wither as well?

171
00:08:05,419 --> 00:08:06,779
Is it in the period of aestivation?

172
00:08:06,779 --> 00:08:08,899
I heard that some succulent plants
will sleep during summertime.

173
00:08:09,659 --> 00:08:10,979
When will it wake up?

174
00:08:11,499 --> 00:08:12,459
September, maybe.

175
00:08:13,339 --> 00:08:14,699
There's nothing I can do.

176
00:08:14,699 --> 00:08:15,819
The university will reopen at that time.

177
00:08:16,419 --> 00:08:17,939
What are you going to do with it?

178
00:08:18,219 --> 00:08:19,499
Qin Kai is injured.

179
00:08:19,499 --> 00:08:20,619
I want to use it to comfort him.

180
00:08:21,179 --> 00:08:22,979
He lost his score.

181
00:08:22,979 --> 00:08:25,259
How can this plant comfort him?

182
00:08:25,259 --> 00:08:26,099
I've got to find a way

183
00:08:26,099 --> 00:08:27,619
to help him get over it.

184
00:08:28,379 --> 00:08:29,699
Though he didn't mention it,

185
00:08:29,699 --> 00:08:30,859
he must've felt upset.

186
00:08:34,139 --> 00:08:35,219
It's life.

187
00:08:35,219 --> 00:08:36,059
It's fate.

188
00:08:36,499 --> 00:08:37,659
We wouldn't know which will come first,

189
00:08:37,659 --> 00:08:38,699
the college entrance exam
or an accident.

190
00:08:43,339 --> 00:08:43,979
Lin Xi,

191
00:08:43,979 --> 00:08:45,179
someone is downstairs looking for you.

192
00:08:46,259 --> 00:08:47,139
Thank you.

193
00:09:07,619 --> 00:09:08,619
Mr. Ji?

194
00:09:09,139 --> 00:09:10,259
Why are you here?

195
00:09:10,579 --> 00:09:11,299
Lin Xi,

196
00:09:11,859 --> 00:09:13,499
I'd like to talk to you.

197
00:09:14,019 --> 00:09:14,899
Sure.

198
00:09:16,259 --> 00:09:17,339
Ji Junxing just received

199
00:09:17,339 --> 00:09:19,139
the offer letter from NIT
a few days ago.

200
00:09:19,139 --> 00:09:20,099
Do you know that?

201
00:09:21,019 --> 00:09:22,699
Didn't he want to go
to Jinghua University?

202
00:09:22,699 --> 00:09:24,339
Why did he apply for NIT?

203
00:09:24,899 --> 00:09:25,539
Yes.

204
00:09:25,979 --> 00:09:26,539
NIT is

205
00:09:26,539 --> 00:09:28,179
his biggest dream.

206
00:09:29,339 --> 00:09:30,899
When Ji Junxing was in middle school,

207
00:09:30,899 --> 00:09:32,379
he came to visit me in America.

208
00:09:32,659 --> 00:09:35,099
When he passed the entrance of NIT,

209
00:09:35,099 --> 00:09:36,699
he pointed at it and told me

210
00:09:37,179 --> 00:09:39,099
that he was going to study there.

211
00:09:40,099 --> 00:09:41,219
Since then,

212
00:09:41,219 --> 00:09:42,739
he has been studying hard.

213
00:09:43,099 --> 00:09:45,259
Two days ago, he finally got

214
00:09:45,259 --> 00:09:46,139
the offer letter

215
00:09:46,139 --> 00:09:46,859
from NIT.

216
00:09:47,499 --> 00:09:48,939
But,

217
00:09:48,939 --> 00:09:50,139
somehow,

218
00:09:50,779 --> 00:09:51,939
he suddenly gave up.

219
00:09:54,219 --> 00:09:55,019
What about you?

220
00:09:55,339 --> 00:09:56,939
Do you have a desired college?

221
00:09:58,699 --> 00:09:59,979
I haven't decided yet.

222
00:10:00,979 --> 00:10:02,459
How about this?

223
00:10:05,339 --> 00:10:07,179
I agree to let you be my schoolfellow.

224
00:10:07,739 --> 00:10:09,259
Come to Jinghua University with me.

225
00:10:12,219 --> 00:10:13,579
Be your schoolfellow?

226
00:10:14,259 --> 00:10:15,779
Well, I've got to think about it.

227
00:10:17,299 --> 00:10:20,219
He might've got his own consideration.

228
00:10:22,539 --> 00:10:24,819
A young man is impulsive and headstrong.

229
00:10:24,819 --> 00:10:25,859
I can understand it.

230
00:10:26,419 --> 00:10:28,059
But this is not a trivial matter

231
00:10:28,059 --> 00:10:29,859
like having meals or buying clothes.

232
00:10:30,259 --> 00:10:31,899
This is about his future.

233
00:10:31,899 --> 00:10:33,579
It's a decision of his life.

234
00:10:37,219 --> 00:10:38,859
I know that you guys are close.

235
00:10:39,299 --> 00:10:41,779
I hope you could help me convince him.

236
00:10:45,619 --> 00:10:46,259
I...

237
00:10:47,099 --> 00:10:47,779
Lin Xi,

238
00:10:48,499 --> 00:10:49,859
we do this for his own good.

239
00:10:50,459 --> 00:10:51,099
Don't you think?

240
00:10:54,019 --> 00:10:54,739
Right.

241
00:11:11,259 --> 00:11:12,459
NIT.

242
00:11:13,259 --> 00:11:14,339
Jinghua University.

243
00:11:15,139 --> 00:11:16,139
NIT.

244
00:11:16,779 --> 00:11:17,859
Jinghua University.

245
00:11:28,819 --> 00:11:30,419
What should I do?

246
00:11:52,339 --> 00:11:53,539
What took you so long?

247
00:11:53,539 --> 00:11:54,939
You've skipped the classroom duty.

248
00:11:54,939 --> 00:11:55,939
You even skipped self-study.

249
00:11:56,419 --> 00:11:57,819
Do you still want to go
to Jinghua University?

250
00:12:01,459 --> 00:12:02,059
Right.

251
00:12:02,499 --> 00:12:03,739
I'm not going to Jinghua University.

252
00:12:05,779 --> 00:12:06,579
Why?

253
00:12:10,219 --> 00:12:11,259
Most of the students in this class

254
00:12:11,259 --> 00:12:12,379
chose Jinghua University.

255
00:12:12,379 --> 00:12:13,179
It's a herd mentality.

256
00:12:13,179 --> 00:12:14,179
Boring.

257
00:12:14,179 --> 00:12:14,939
Lin Xi.

258
00:12:16,259 --> 00:12:18,299
Going to Jinghua Medical School is
your dream, isn't it?

259
00:12:19,859 --> 00:12:21,419
There are many medical schools.

260
00:12:21,419 --> 00:12:22,899
Why must I go to Jinghua University?

261
00:12:23,739 --> 00:12:24,859
Then, where are you planning to go?

262
00:12:25,179 --> 00:12:26,019
It's none of your business.

263
00:12:26,659 --> 00:12:27,579
Are you going to follow me

264
00:12:27,579 --> 00:12:28,419
everywhere I go?

265
00:12:29,019 --> 00:12:30,219
I can do that.

266
00:12:30,579 --> 00:12:32,539
Don't you have a mind of your own?

267
00:12:33,139 --> 00:12:33,499
No.

268
00:12:33,499 --> 00:12:35,019
You were the person who asked me

269
00:12:35,019 --> 00:12:36,059
to be your schoolfellow,

270
00:12:36,059 --> 00:12:37,419
and to go to Jinghua University
with you.

271
00:12:39,419 --> 00:12:41,139
If there wasn't a promise like this,

272
00:12:41,139 --> 00:12:41,939
where would you go?

273
00:12:42,419 --> 00:12:43,699
There are no ifs,

274
00:12:43,699 --> 00:12:44,739
only results.

275
00:12:45,219 --> 00:12:46,379
Since the six of us have decided

276
00:12:46,379 --> 00:12:47,459
to stay together,

277
00:12:47,459 --> 00:12:48,859
I won't go anywhere else.

278
00:12:49,659 --> 00:12:51,459
Even if it's a college that's better
than Jinghua University?

279
00:12:53,819 --> 00:12:54,619
Such as?

280
00:12:56,339 --> 00:12:56,939
There are many.

281
00:12:56,939 --> 00:12:57,579
You knew

282
00:12:57,579 --> 00:12:58,979
I was accepted by NIT, didn't you?

283
00:13:01,499 --> 00:13:02,339
I knew it.

284
00:13:02,339 --> 00:13:03,219
Congratulations.

285
00:13:04,299 --> 00:13:05,619
Did my dad come to you?

286
00:13:08,259 --> 00:13:09,779
He asked you to convince me, didn't he?

287
00:13:10,259 --> 00:13:11,699
That's not the point.

288
00:13:11,699 --> 00:13:12,899
The point is that you have
a better choice now.

289
00:13:12,899 --> 00:13:13,939
You should go.

290
00:13:14,339 --> 00:13:15,539
Do you really think so?

291
00:13:16,579 --> 00:13:17,699
I think your dad is right.

292
00:13:19,139 --> 00:13:19,979
I thought

293
00:13:20,779 --> 00:13:22,299
you would take my side.

294
00:13:23,419 --> 00:13:24,659
I'll side with those who have the point.

295
00:13:25,859 --> 00:13:27,219
Don't get hung up on it.

296
00:13:27,219 --> 00:13:28,019
If Jinghua University is

297
00:13:28,019 --> 00:13:29,419
an interference factor,

298
00:13:30,499 --> 00:13:31,539
I'll get rid of it for you.

299
00:13:34,859 --> 00:13:36,099
Just pretend that it never existed.

300
00:14:06,299 --> 00:14:06,819
(Dad,)

301
00:14:07,219 --> 00:14:09,259
(it's my own choice
to choose Jinghua University.)

302
00:14:09,419 --> 00:14:10,899
(Lin Xi has nothing to do with it.)

303
00:14:11,379 --> 00:14:12,819
(Stop bothering her.)

304
00:14:42,139 --> 00:14:42,779
Qin Kai!

305
00:14:43,939 --> 00:14:44,379
Qin Kai!

306
00:14:44,379 --> 00:14:45,459
You want to lose your leg?

307
00:14:47,659 --> 00:14:48,579
It's none of your business.

308
00:14:50,219 --> 00:14:51,259
What you should do now is

309
00:14:51,259 --> 00:14:52,539
to go back and lie down.

310
00:14:53,539 --> 00:14:55,099
What has it got to do with you?

311
00:14:56,179 --> 00:14:57,019
Suit yourself.

312
00:14:57,619 --> 00:14:58,659
Lend me your scooter.

313
00:15:00,379 --> 00:15:01,259
No way.

314
00:15:07,419 --> 00:15:09,379
Where are you taking me?

315
00:15:09,379 --> 00:15:10,699
A place where there are no people.

316
00:15:11,339 --> 00:15:13,019
Are you eloping with me?

317
00:15:13,499 --> 00:15:14,499
Are you insane?

318
00:15:14,499 --> 00:15:15,739
Why would I elope with you?

319
00:15:16,099 --> 00:15:17,179
As a friendly reminder,

320
00:15:17,179 --> 00:15:18,739
this is my scooter.

321
00:15:19,099 --> 00:15:20,259
If you want to elope with me,

322
00:15:20,259 --> 00:15:21,859
it can only go for 60 kilometers.

323
00:15:23,939 --> 00:15:24,819
Let go.

324
00:15:24,819 --> 00:15:25,619
No.

325
00:15:39,779 --> 00:15:40,659
It's no fun.

326
00:15:41,019 --> 00:15:41,619
Your scooter

327
00:15:41,619 --> 00:15:43,019
ran out of battery so soon.

328
00:15:43,979 --> 00:15:45,259
We're already out of town.

329
00:15:45,259 --> 00:15:46,419
Where else do you want to go?

330
00:15:46,899 --> 00:15:48,299
Anywhere will do.

331
00:15:48,299 --> 00:15:49,179
Just not back there.

332
00:15:50,379 --> 00:15:52,059
A good student will skip classes too?

333
00:15:53,179 --> 00:15:53,979
What's wrong?

334
00:15:53,979 --> 00:15:55,179
You're in a bad mood too?

335
00:15:55,739 --> 00:15:56,819
What do you think?

336
00:15:57,379 --> 00:15:58,819
You won't be worse off than me.

337
00:15:59,739 --> 00:16:00,579
My leg is injured.

338
00:16:00,579 --> 00:16:01,979
My dad found it annoying

339
00:16:01,979 --> 00:16:03,059
even when the coach called him.

340
00:16:03,699 --> 00:16:05,059
Isn't that great?

341
00:16:05,299 --> 00:16:06,179
You're a free man.

342
00:16:06,819 --> 00:16:07,659
At least,

343
00:16:07,659 --> 00:16:09,739
your dad won't interfere
with your choice of university

344
00:16:09,739 --> 00:16:10,979
and choice of major.

345
00:16:13,419 --> 00:16:16,059
Aren't you recommended
for admission to Jinghua University?

346
00:16:16,499 --> 00:16:18,659
Your parents are not satisfied with it?

347
00:16:21,939 --> 00:16:22,699
The point is

348
00:16:22,699 --> 00:16:24,139
I've also got the offer letter from NIT.

349
00:16:25,499 --> 00:16:27,099
That's courting envy.

350
00:16:28,259 --> 00:16:29,499
You don't understand.

351
00:16:30,019 --> 00:16:32,059
Yes, I don't.

352
00:16:32,059 --> 00:16:32,739
If I were you,

353
00:16:32,739 --> 00:16:34,059
I wouldn't agonize over it.

354
00:16:37,139 --> 00:16:38,419
If you were me,

355
00:16:39,259 --> 00:16:40,179
what would you do?

356
00:16:41,219 --> 00:16:42,659
Just be myself.

357
00:16:42,659 --> 00:16:45,899
He can't take control of your life.

358
00:16:45,899 --> 00:16:46,939
In the end,

359
00:16:46,939 --> 00:16:48,259
you're the one who lives it.

360
00:16:48,979 --> 00:16:51,779
My dad is a little unreliable,

361
00:16:51,779 --> 00:16:54,099
but he's quite right about one thing.

362
00:16:54,499 --> 00:16:56,779
He said life is like a business.

363
00:16:56,779 --> 00:16:58,059
It has only one owner.

364
00:16:58,059 --> 00:16:59,139
That is yourself.

365
00:17:11,899 --> 00:17:14,699
If you were me,

366
00:17:14,699 --> 00:17:15,739
what would you do?

367
00:17:16,699 --> 00:17:18,619
Will you give up
or withstand it for another year?

368
00:17:19,299 --> 00:17:21,139
For the sake of your favorite major,

369
00:17:21,539 --> 00:17:22,619
it's nothing to wait for another year.

370
00:17:23,499 --> 00:17:24,859
There's a long way ahead of us.

371
00:17:25,739 --> 00:17:26,699
Think about Kobe.

372
00:17:27,499 --> 00:17:29,619
When the Lakers competed
with the Warriors,

373
00:17:30,019 --> 00:17:31,499
his Achilles tendon ruptured.

374
00:17:31,499 --> 00:17:33,339
The wounded would normally be
carried out on a stretcher.

375
00:17:33,699 --> 00:17:35,859
He was the only one
who insisted on serving the ball.

376
00:17:36,259 --> 00:17:37,259
He even bounced it in twice.

377
00:17:38,179 --> 00:17:39,739
This is the spirit of Mamba.

378
00:17:40,259 --> 00:17:41,379
Never give up.

379
00:17:42,419 --> 00:17:42,979
If you choose

380
00:17:42,979 --> 00:17:44,619
to apply for a random college,

381
00:17:45,179 --> 00:17:46,299
I'm sure

382
00:17:47,059 --> 00:17:49,499
you'll want to travel back in time
and give yourself

383
00:17:49,819 --> 00:17:51,219
two slaps on the face in the future.

384
00:17:53,459 --> 00:17:55,179
After hearing what you said,

385
00:17:55,179 --> 00:17:56,299
I feel a lot better.

386
00:17:57,699 --> 00:17:58,379
Thanks.

387
00:18:11,779 --> 00:18:12,619
I'll let you guys talk.

388
00:18:12,619 --> 00:18:13,619
I've got work to do.

389
00:18:13,619 --> 00:18:14,379
I'll get going.

390
00:18:19,579 --> 00:18:20,419
Did you have a fight?

391
00:18:21,659 --> 00:18:23,219
We did have a little disagreement.

392
00:18:24,379 --> 00:18:26,299
Where were you guys?

393
00:18:26,299 --> 00:18:27,339
We went sightseeing.

394
00:18:27,699 --> 00:18:29,019
You're awfully chipper.

395
00:18:30,859 --> 00:18:32,579
I was going to console you.

396
00:18:32,579 --> 00:18:34,459
It seems like you don't need it.

397
00:18:34,459 --> 00:18:35,579
No.

398
00:18:35,579 --> 00:18:37,779
I'm still in the trough of my life.

399
00:18:37,779 --> 00:18:39,459
Your help is all I need.

400
00:18:46,099 --> 00:18:47,299
This is a gold medal for you.

401
00:18:48,179 --> 00:18:49,139
Is this all?

402
00:18:49,139 --> 00:18:50,539
Is there any citation?

403
00:18:52,979 --> 00:18:54,539
Contestant Qin Kai.

404
00:18:54,539 --> 00:18:56,019
Whatever the result of the race is,

405
00:18:56,019 --> 00:18:57,579
to me, you're always the champion.

406
00:18:59,979 --> 00:19:00,779
Lower your head.

407
00:19:04,819 --> 00:19:05,499
Really?

408
00:19:05,979 --> 00:19:06,819
Of course.

409
00:19:06,819 --> 00:19:07,579
When you recover

410
00:19:07,579 --> 00:19:08,459
and return to the arena,

411
00:19:08,459 --> 00:19:10,459
you're still the big star
in the hurdling race.

412
00:19:12,739 --> 00:19:14,139
Why don't you try biting it?

413
00:19:18,539 --> 00:19:19,539
This is not made of pure gold.

414
00:19:19,539 --> 00:19:20,459
It hurts my teeth.

415
00:19:20,459 --> 00:19:21,659
Quit the act.

416
00:19:21,659 --> 00:19:23,019
This is chocolate.

417
00:19:24,339 --> 00:19:26,099
It's just a chocolate

418
00:19:26,099 --> 00:19:27,459
but it's the gold medal

419
00:19:27,459 --> 00:19:29,259
with the highest gold content
I've ever received.

420
00:19:56,419 --> 00:19:57,779
It's a total mess.

421
00:19:58,899 --> 00:20:00,779
Look at your score.

422
00:20:01,979 --> 00:20:02,819
This is

423
00:20:02,819 --> 00:20:05,019
your provincial ranking
for the second mock test.

424
00:20:05,419 --> 00:20:07,600
This is the closest result to that
of the real college entrance exam.

425
00:20:07,600 --> 00:20:08,760
(Fluctuation Range)

426
00:20:08,760 --> 00:20:09,979
Do the math yourself.

427
00:20:09,979 --> 00:20:10,859
How much closer are you

428
00:20:10,859 --> 00:20:11,899
to your desired university?

429
00:20:13,499 --> 00:20:14,939
All of you looked ambitious

430
00:20:15,379 --> 00:20:17,099
when you stuck it
on the aspiration tree.

431
00:20:18,019 --> 00:20:19,379
What's with the spiritless look?

432
00:20:21,019 --> 00:20:22,419
We only get two-digit days

433
00:20:22,419 --> 00:20:23,779
until the college entrance exam.

434
00:20:23,779 --> 00:20:24,659
Guys.

435
00:20:25,099 --> 00:20:28,059
Some students' grades are getting worse.

436
00:20:28,459 --> 00:20:29,739
I'm worried about you.

437
00:20:34,779 --> 00:20:35,459
What's the matter?

438
00:20:35,459 --> 00:20:36,819
You look depressed.

439
00:20:36,819 --> 00:20:37,939
Here, have a candy.

440
00:20:47,099 --> 00:20:48,499
This result slip makes

441
00:20:48,499 --> 00:20:49,659
the candy tasteless.

442
00:20:50,419 --> 00:20:52,019
It's quite good.

443
00:20:52,019 --> 00:20:53,419
Your provincial rank is 880.

444
00:20:53,419 --> 00:20:54,499
This is a lucky number.

445
00:20:54,899 --> 00:20:56,179
The admission score
of Jinghua University

446
00:20:56,179 --> 00:20:57,379
was 691 last year.

447
00:20:57,379 --> 00:20:59,099
Our provincial ranking should
at least be

448
00:20:59,099 --> 00:21:00,139
in the top 300 to get admitted.

449
00:21:00,819 --> 00:21:02,699
You're one needle away from it.

450
00:21:03,339 --> 00:21:03,899
Gao Yunlang,

451
00:21:03,899 --> 00:21:04,819
how much did you score?

452
00:21:04,819 --> 00:21:06,299
Tell us. It can give
Mianmian some comfort.

453
00:21:06,299 --> 00:21:07,299
691.

454
00:21:08,459 --> 00:21:09,419
Is your gene mutated?

455
00:21:09,419 --> 00:21:10,619
Or did Chen Mo leave you

456
00:21:10,619 --> 00:21:11,779
with some sort of secret weapon?

457
00:21:11,779 --> 00:21:12,859
It's nothing.

458
00:21:12,859 --> 00:21:14,939
All I do is to quit playing games.

459
00:21:16,019 --> 00:21:16,739
Oh no.

460
00:21:16,739 --> 00:21:18,259
I suffer even more now.

461
00:21:18,859 --> 00:21:19,579
It's alright.

462
00:21:19,579 --> 00:21:21,099
I'm worse than you.

463
00:21:21,099 --> 00:21:22,179
I played below par this time.

464
00:21:22,179 --> 00:21:24,019
I heard that my dad almost fainted

465
00:21:24,019 --> 00:21:25,059
when he saw my result.

466
00:21:25,059 --> 00:21:26,499
He almost needed
a quick-acting heart pill.

467
00:21:27,859 --> 00:21:29,139
Is Mr. Xie alright?

468
00:21:29,939 --> 00:21:31,059
He's fine.

469
00:21:31,859 --> 00:21:32,779
But I'm afraid

470
00:21:32,779 --> 00:21:34,339
I won't be able to see
the light of day again.

471
00:21:34,339 --> 00:21:35,699
How could you smile at a time like this?

472
00:21:36,099 --> 00:21:37,099
It's better to spend the day

473
00:21:37,099 --> 00:21:38,179
with a smile than with a cry.

474
00:21:38,179 --> 00:21:39,419
The college entrance exam is
about mentality.

475
00:21:39,419 --> 00:21:40,259
If we break down,

476
00:21:40,259 --> 00:21:41,379
everything will be over.

477
00:21:41,899 --> 00:21:43,699
Look how calm Ji Junxing is.

478
00:21:43,699 --> 00:21:45,139
If I was recommended
for admission to Jinghua University,

479
00:21:45,139 --> 00:21:46,939
I'd be calm even with a score
of zero in the test.

480
00:21:48,379 --> 00:21:49,019
Lin Xi,

481
00:21:49,019 --> 00:21:49,979
what's your score?

482
00:21:50,859 --> 00:21:51,939
701.

483
00:21:53,699 --> 00:21:55,299
You're almost there.

484
00:21:55,299 --> 00:21:57,219
And Ji Junxing can get admitted
for sure.

485
00:21:57,219 --> 00:21:59,179
Don't leave us behind by then.

486
00:22:16,579 --> 00:22:17,859
It's getting late.

487
00:22:19,379 --> 00:22:20,299
Liu Yin.

488
00:22:22,219 --> 00:22:23,739
Mom, why are you here again?

489
00:22:24,179 --> 00:22:25,379
The monthly test is approaching.

490
00:22:25,379 --> 00:22:26,539
I don't have time for this.

491
00:22:26,979 --> 00:22:28,179
I know the test is coming up.

492
00:22:28,179 --> 00:22:29,859
So I'm here to bring you some stuff.

493
00:22:30,979 --> 00:22:31,619
Look.

494
00:22:32,219 --> 00:22:33,179
This is lutein.

495
00:22:33,499 --> 00:22:34,659
It could protect your eyes.

496
00:22:35,899 --> 00:22:36,819
And this is

497
00:22:37,259 --> 00:22:38,299
DHA.

498
00:22:38,739 --> 00:22:39,539
It's good for your brain.

499
00:22:40,819 --> 00:22:42,219
This is Bovine Colostrum Powder.

500
00:22:42,219 --> 00:22:44,539
Drink it every morning and night.

501
00:22:45,339 --> 00:22:46,299
And this,

502
00:22:46,699 --> 00:22:48,219
Vitamin C Effervescent Tablets.

503
00:22:48,219 --> 00:22:49,219
You don't have to go to the hospital

504
00:22:49,219 --> 00:22:50,539
when you catch a cold.

505
00:22:50,859 --> 00:22:51,979
Just consume two pieces of it will do.

506
00:22:52,259 --> 00:22:53,499
Here, take it.

507
00:22:54,739 --> 00:22:55,979
There's still a lot in my dorm.

508
00:22:56,939 --> 00:22:58,179
As a backup.

509
00:23:01,819 --> 00:23:03,299
Can I not take it?

510
00:23:05,059 --> 00:23:06,619
I can't sleep at night after taking it.

511
00:23:07,779 --> 00:23:08,739
Is that so?

512
00:23:09,899 --> 00:23:10,819
Well, next time,

513
00:23:10,819 --> 00:23:12,619
I'll get you some sleeping pills.

514
00:23:15,299 --> 00:23:16,139
Forget it.

515
00:23:16,779 --> 00:23:17,699
I'm going to do revision.

516
00:23:18,339 --> 00:23:19,339
Wait.

517
00:23:26,779 --> 00:23:27,979
I came

518
00:23:27,979 --> 00:23:29,299
to give you this.

519
00:23:34,699 --> 00:23:36,619
Why do you give me this, mom?

520
00:23:37,939 --> 00:23:38,499
Well,

521
00:23:39,739 --> 00:23:41,779
why did you play below par
in this second mock test?

522
00:23:45,739 --> 00:23:47,019
I was on my period.

523
00:23:49,499 --> 00:23:50,619
I don't want to eat it.

524
00:23:51,299 --> 00:23:53,179
You must eat it.

525
00:23:54,019 --> 00:23:54,459
For your sake,

526
00:23:54,459 --> 00:23:56,379
I've done many things
that I don't want to do.

527
00:23:59,819 --> 00:24:00,939
I quit my job

528
00:24:00,939 --> 00:24:02,339
and sold the house.

529
00:24:02,339 --> 00:24:04,099
I moved to be closer to your school.

530
00:24:04,099 --> 00:24:05,779
I created all conditions for you

531
00:24:05,779 --> 00:24:06,579
so that you could get

532
00:24:06,579 --> 00:24:08,099
admitted to a good college.

533
00:24:08,699 --> 00:24:10,059
You would waste my effort

534
00:24:10,059 --> 00:24:11,299
if you failed the exam.

535
00:24:16,699 --> 00:24:17,699
I understand.

536
00:24:19,819 --> 00:24:21,099
Remember to eat it.

537
00:24:31,659 --> 00:24:32,499
Oh no!

538
00:24:32,499 --> 00:24:33,619
Xie Ang is in trouble.

539
00:24:35,179 --> 00:24:35,939
I'm leaving.

540
00:24:35,939 --> 00:24:36,619
Don't worry.

541
00:24:36,619 --> 00:24:38,299
I'll bring your wishes

542
00:24:38,299 --> 00:24:40,099
with me.

543
00:24:40,099 --> 00:24:40,979
Xie Ang.

544
00:24:41,659 --> 00:24:42,899
What does it mean?

545
00:24:42,899 --> 00:24:44,139
It sounds like he's running
away from home.

546
00:24:44,499 --> 00:24:45,939
There's another meaning to that.

547
00:24:45,939 --> 00:24:46,979
I wonder if I should say it.

548
00:24:46,979 --> 00:24:47,899
Touch wood.

549
00:24:48,539 --> 00:24:50,379
I think this is what he means.

550
00:24:51,059 --> 00:24:52,619
Do you remember that
yesterday he said

551
00:24:52,619 --> 00:24:54,299
he can't see the light of the day again?

552
00:24:54,299 --> 00:24:55,779
It's Xie Ang's catchphrase.

553
00:24:55,779 --> 00:24:56,779
He said it many times a day.

554
00:24:56,779 --> 00:24:58,339
But he's still well and alive.

555
00:24:58,339 --> 00:24:59,099
A few days ago,

556
00:24:59,099 --> 00:25:00,499
he told me about the afterlife.

557
00:25:00,499 --> 00:25:01,179
Why did he talk

558
00:25:01,179 --> 00:25:02,619
about that if he's fine?

559
00:25:02,619 --> 00:25:04,579
Is it because he's stressed out
due to the exam?

560
00:25:04,579 --> 00:25:06,459
Is he suffering from depression?

561
00:25:11,099 --> 00:25:13,059
He got a poor score

562
00:25:13,059 --> 00:25:14,699
but he still cheered us up yesterday.

563
00:25:14,699 --> 00:25:16,299
He must've felt upset.

564
00:25:16,299 --> 00:25:17,579
Calm down.

565
00:25:17,579 --> 00:25:19,299
Let's think out where he'll go.

566
00:25:21,499 --> 00:25:23,339
I think he has told me a few days ago
that he wanted

567
00:25:23,339 --> 00:25:24,859
to go to the rear hill of our school.

568
00:25:30,779 --> 00:25:32,619
- Xie Ang!
- Xie Ang!

569
00:25:33,139 --> 00:25:34,699
Xie Ang!

570
00:25:36,779 --> 00:25:38,419
Xie Ang!

571
00:25:40,179 --> 00:25:41,139
There are two paths.

572
00:25:41,139 --> 00:25:41,819
One is the way up.

573
00:25:41,819 --> 00:25:42,979
The other one is the way down.

574
00:25:42,979 --> 00:25:44,259
Let's split up.

575
00:25:44,259 --> 00:25:45,259
Let's go, Mianmian.

576
00:25:45,259 --> 00:25:46,019
Okay.

577
00:25:46,059 --> 00:25:46,259
Let's go.

578
00:25:46,259 --> 00:25:47,179
It won't do.

579
00:25:47,179 --> 00:25:48,099
We're in the middle of nowhere.

580
00:25:48,099 --> 00:25:49,179
The boy must lead the girl.

581
00:25:49,179 --> 00:25:50,019
It'll be more secure.

582
00:25:50,459 --> 00:25:50,859
Jiang Yimian,

583
00:25:50,859 --> 00:25:51,699
you come with me.

584
00:25:51,699 --> 00:25:52,099
Okay.

585
00:25:52,099 --> 00:25:53,459
You go with Ji Junxing.

586
00:25:53,459 --> 00:25:54,339
Quick.

587
00:25:54,339 --> 00:25:54,659
Let's go.

588
00:25:54,659 --> 00:25:55,339
We'll go up.

589
00:25:57,499 --> 00:25:58,320
Xie Ang!

590
00:25:58,320 --> 00:25:58,840
- Xie Ang!
- Xie Ang!

591
00:25:59,080 --> 00:25:59,800
Xie Ang!

592
00:26:01,099 --> 00:26:02,019
Xie Ang!

593
00:26:03,579 --> 00:26:04,659
Xie Ang!

594
00:26:07,059 --> 00:26:07,699
Come, hold my hand.

595
00:26:07,699 --> 00:26:08,379
I'm fine.

596
00:26:09,979 --> 00:26:10,939
Let me help you.

597
00:26:11,859 --> 00:26:12,539
Let's go.

598
00:26:17,059 --> 00:26:17,739
Look.

599
00:26:18,059 --> 00:26:19,779
What is the white thing over there?

600
00:26:21,659 --> 00:26:22,699
Let's go check it out.

601
00:26:22,979 --> 00:26:24,779
Xie Ang!

602
00:26:26,419 --> 00:26:27,259
Xie Ang!

603
00:26:28,419 --> 00:26:30,339
Xie Ang!

604
00:26:30,699 --> 00:26:31,699
Xie Ang!

605
00:26:32,099 --> 00:26:32,739
You fool!

606
00:26:32,739 --> 00:26:34,299
Come on out now!

607
00:26:36,499 --> 00:26:38,419
Xie Ang!

608
00:26:38,899 --> 00:26:39,779
Xie Ang!

609
00:26:39,779 --> 00:26:40,699
It's Lin Xi and Ji Junxing.

610
00:26:40,780 --> 00:26:41,740
Lin Xi,

611
00:26:42,019 --> 00:26:43,099
did you get anything?

612
00:26:44,499 --> 00:26:45,539
We didn't see him.

613
00:26:45,539 --> 00:26:47,019
But we found a shoe.

614
00:26:47,379 --> 00:26:48,779
This belongs to Xie Ang.

615
00:26:48,779 --> 00:26:49,779
Why is it here?

616
00:26:50,459 --> 00:26:52,139
Did something really happen to him?

617
00:26:52,579 --> 00:26:53,299
It's just a shoe.

618
00:26:53,299 --> 00:26:54,419
Don't think too much.

619
00:26:56,459 --> 00:26:57,379
Yes.

620
00:26:57,379 --> 00:26:59,059
It's just a shoe.

621
00:26:59,299 --> 00:27:01,179
This shoe must've pinched his foot.

622
00:27:01,459 --> 00:27:03,099
So he threw it away in a fit of pique.

623
00:27:03,379 --> 00:27:04,019
Yes.

624
00:27:04,579 --> 00:27:06,419
Right, it's possible.

625
00:27:07,339 --> 00:27:09,419
Who would throw the shoe away

626
00:27:09,419 --> 00:27:11,099
in the middle of nowhere?

627
00:27:11,099 --> 00:27:12,139
- He'll be fine.
- He'll be fine.

628
00:27:12,139 --> 00:27:13,139
Calm down, don't worry.

629
00:27:13,139 --> 00:27:14,379
What to do?

630
00:27:14,379 --> 00:27:15,339
Xie Ang,

631
00:27:15,339 --> 00:27:16,819
just come back.

632
00:27:16,819 --> 00:27:18,659
I won't hit you again.

633
00:27:18,659 --> 00:27:19,659
Xie Ang,

634
00:27:19,659 --> 00:27:20,259
come back!

635
00:27:20,259 --> 00:27:21,819
Why are your hands on her?

636
00:27:21,819 --> 00:27:22,459
Get your hands off her.

637
00:27:22,459 --> 00:27:23,739
Where have you been?

638
00:27:25,059 --> 00:27:26,219
Xie Ang.

639
00:27:26,219 --> 00:27:28,379
You're not dead.

640
00:27:28,379 --> 00:27:29,019
What's wrong?

641
00:27:29,019 --> 00:27:30,379
Why are you crying?

642
00:27:30,379 --> 00:27:31,819
There, there. It's alright.

643
00:27:31,819 --> 00:27:32,979
I'm fine, there, there.

644
00:27:32,979 --> 00:27:34,059
What's going on?

645
00:27:34,059 --> 00:27:35,899
What's your shoe doing here?

646
00:27:36,299 --> 00:27:38,299
I was taking a selfie just now.

647
00:27:38,299 --> 00:27:39,259
And I accidentally kicked off my shoe.

648
00:27:39,259 --> 00:27:40,259
Why do you have it?

649
00:27:40,259 --> 00:27:41,339
I feel bad because of it.

650
00:27:41,339 --> 00:27:42,659
You still have the mood for a selfie?

651
00:27:42,659 --> 00:27:43,739
I thought

652
00:27:43,739 --> 00:27:44,579
you were dead.

653
00:27:44,579 --> 00:27:45,139
That's enough.

654
00:27:45,139 --> 00:27:46,259
Do you know how long
we've been looking for you?

655
00:27:46,259 --> 00:27:47,059
I even yelled myself hoarse.

656
00:27:47,059 --> 00:27:47,859
If you leave without telling us again,

657
00:27:47,859 --> 00:27:48,619
I'll smack you in the head.

658
00:27:48,619 --> 00:27:49,659
Stop!

659
00:27:49,659 --> 00:27:50,819
Can any of you tell me

660
00:27:50,819 --> 00:27:52,059
what has happened?

661
00:27:52,059 --> 00:27:53,339
Didn't you leave us a note?

662
00:27:53,339 --> 00:27:53,979
You said

663
00:27:53,979 --> 00:27:55,299
you were leaving.

664
00:27:55,899 --> 00:27:56,539
I heard

665
00:27:56,539 --> 00:27:58,019
the stone lion
on the hill is efficacious.

666
00:27:58,019 --> 00:27:59,059
So I came to pray to it

667
00:27:59,059 --> 00:28:00,459
and also to pray for you guys.

668
00:28:01,539 --> 00:28:02,659
What were you thinking?

669
00:28:02,939 --> 00:28:04,299
Stone lion?

670
00:28:04,299 --> 00:28:05,619
What stone lion?

671
00:28:10,219 --> 00:28:11,379
Don't cry.

672
00:28:11,379 --> 00:28:12,979
What does this stone lion look like?

673
00:28:13,779 --> 00:28:15,979
The monastic title of this lion is
Demon-Slaying Divine Lion.

674
00:28:16,299 --> 00:28:17,699
It's got a pair of bunked eyes,

675
00:28:17,699 --> 00:28:19,099
and a mouth of sharp teeth.

676
00:28:19,299 --> 00:28:20,619
There are balls under its feet.

677
00:28:20,619 --> 00:28:21,859
It holds its head high.

678
00:28:22,779 --> 00:28:24,019
It's like riding on the cloud

679
00:28:24,019 --> 00:28:25,299
and like a deity descending from heaven.

680
00:28:25,539 --> 00:28:26,859
We're in the middle of nowhere.

681
00:28:26,859 --> 00:28:27,979
The lion is nowhere to be seen

682
00:28:27,979 --> 00:28:29,099
but there are a lot of bugs.

683
00:28:30,179 --> 00:28:31,539
Impossible.

684
00:28:31,539 --> 00:28:32,779
I've looked it up.

685
00:28:32,779 --> 00:28:33,739
It's right here on this hill.

686
00:28:33,739 --> 00:28:34,579
It's true.

687
00:28:34,579 --> 00:28:35,699
The forest is huge.

688
00:28:35,699 --> 00:28:37,019
We're like finding a needle
in a haystack.

689
00:28:37,019 --> 00:28:38,219
It'll take forever to find it.

690
00:28:38,219 --> 00:28:39,179
Right.

691
00:28:39,179 --> 00:28:39,859
Well,

692
00:28:39,859 --> 00:28:41,539
it's getting late.

693
00:28:41,539 --> 00:28:42,619
Why don't we go back first?

694
00:28:46,219 --> 00:28:46,979
Xie Ang,

695
00:28:48,099 --> 00:28:49,299
what is the thing besides your feet?

696
00:28:52,379 --> 00:28:53,539
This seems to be it.

697
00:28:56,619 --> 00:28:58,179
There really is a stone lion.

698
00:28:58,179 --> 00:28:59,059
This Demon-Slaying Divine Lion

699
00:28:59,059 --> 00:29:00,299
looks so cute.

700
00:29:00,299 --> 00:29:00,979
I know right.

701
00:29:01,419 --> 00:29:02,979
Let's take things as they come.

702
00:29:02,979 --> 00:29:04,099
It'll work if you believe in it.

703
00:29:04,099 --> 00:29:04,859
Let's take turns

704
00:29:04,859 --> 00:29:06,099
and make our wishes.

705
00:29:06,099 --> 00:29:06,419
Sure.

706
00:29:06,419 --> 00:29:07,339
I'll do it first.

707
00:29:07,339 --> 00:29:08,579
I've been waiting all day.

708
00:29:08,579 --> 00:29:09,459
Okay.

709
00:29:11,379 --> 00:29:12,499
Come.

710
00:29:13,459 --> 00:29:15,019
(I wish Jiang Yimian
and I could get admitted)

711
00:29:15,579 --> 00:29:16,819
(to Jinghua University.)

712
00:29:19,899 --> 00:29:20,659
Your turn.

713
00:29:22,259 --> 00:29:24,539
(I wish everyone could be
safe and well.)

714
00:29:24,859 --> 00:29:26,019
(Nothing will happen again.)

715
00:29:32,099 --> 00:29:33,259
(I want to get into Jinghua University)

716
00:29:33,499 --> 00:29:35,339
(and meet up with Cheng Mo sooner.)

717
00:29:41,339 --> 00:29:43,739
(I wish all of us could get
into Jinghua University.)

718
00:29:44,259 --> 00:29:45,899
(No matter where Ji Junxing goes,)

719
00:29:46,219 --> 00:29:48,659
(I wish him all the best.)

720
00:29:48,780 --> 00:29:50,700
♪It's just a drop of water♪

721
00:29:54,300 --> 00:29:57,980
♪It transforms into morning dew,
passes through the mountain♪

722
00:30:01,700 --> 00:30:05,500
♪It merges into the river
and flows into the ocean♪

723
00:30:06,419 --> 00:30:08,259
We've finally completed today's mission.

724
00:30:08,259 --> 00:30:09,019
Let's go back.

725
00:30:09,019 --> 00:30:09,499
- Come on.
- Come on.

726
00:30:09,499 --> 00:30:10,179
Let's go.

727
00:30:10,300 --> 00:30:11,060
♪We knew that one day♪

728
00:30:11,060 --> 00:30:14,580
♪The clock will turn into a dream
and fade away♪

729
00:30:17,859 --> 00:30:19,819
What did you wish for just now?

730
00:30:20,259 --> 00:30:21,579
We could go
to Jinghua University together.

731
00:30:22,059 --> 00:30:23,539
Are you sure
you don't want to go to NIT?

732
00:30:23,819 --> 00:30:25,579
Do you really want me to go to NIT?

733
00:30:25,579 --> 00:30:26,619
The admission rate
of students from China

734
00:30:26,619 --> 00:30:27,379
in NIT is only 0.2 percent.

735
00:30:27,379 --> 00:30:28,579
You're a fool if you don't go.

736
00:30:29,019 --> 00:30:30,339
I'm asking if you want me to go.

737
00:30:30,339 --> 00:30:31,219
I don't want but...

738
00:30:35,699 --> 00:30:37,259
So what?

739
00:30:37,259 --> 00:30:38,259
Don't you think it's wayward

740
00:30:38,259 --> 00:30:39,979
to give up on such a good chance?

741
00:30:40,659 --> 00:30:41,739
I'm not being wayward.

742
00:30:42,019 --> 00:30:43,739
I've had a careful consideration
before making this decision.

743
00:30:44,539 --> 00:30:46,339
I want to go to my favorite college

744
00:30:46,339 --> 00:30:47,459
with my favorite friends

745
00:30:47,459 --> 00:30:48,699
and choose the major I like.

746
00:30:48,699 --> 00:30:50,659
This is the best choice for me.

747
00:30:51,219 --> 00:30:53,019
This is about your future.

748
00:30:53,419 --> 00:30:54,499
How could I leave

749
00:30:55,339 --> 00:30:56,379
my friends for my future?

750
00:30:57,059 --> 00:30:59,179
You can make friends in NIT as well.

751
00:31:02,179 --> 00:31:03,339
Not quite.

752
00:31:06,779 --> 00:31:07,619
Indeed.

753
00:31:10,019 --> 00:31:10,939
So,

754
00:31:12,499 --> 00:31:14,339
you're taking my side?

755
00:31:16,139 --> 00:31:17,819
If this is your final decision,

756
00:31:18,179 --> 00:31:19,459
I have no reason to oppose it.

757
00:31:21,819 --> 00:31:24,059
But what about your dad?

758
00:31:24,899 --> 00:31:27,659
I'll continue to convince him.

759
00:31:27,659 --> 00:31:28,779
I'll try again if it doesn't work

760
00:31:28,779 --> 00:31:30,059
until he agrees.

761
00:31:30,419 --> 00:31:31,219
Besides,

762
00:31:31,219 --> 00:31:32,139
I'm protected

763
00:31:32,139 --> 00:31:33,819
by the Demon-Slaying Divine Lion now.

764
00:31:37,619 --> 00:31:38,339
Let's go.

765
00:31:42,979 --> 00:31:43,459
Slow down.

766
00:31:43,459 --> 00:31:45,099
Jiang Yimian!

767
00:31:46,699 --> 00:31:47,379
Mr. Xie,

768
00:31:47,819 --> 00:31:49,819
are you sure the kids are on the hill?

769
00:31:49,819 --> 00:31:51,419
They went this way.

770
00:31:51,779 --> 00:31:52,899
Calm down.

771
00:31:53,259 --> 00:31:54,259
There are kids who come

772
00:31:54,259 --> 00:31:55,499
to the rear hill every year.

773
00:31:55,499 --> 00:31:56,019
Sometimes,

774
00:31:56,019 --> 00:31:57,659
they come up here to calm their minds.

775
00:31:58,139 --> 00:31:59,259
Calm down. Don't worry.

776
00:31:59,619 --> 00:32:00,379
Let's keep looking.

777
00:32:00,379 --> 00:32:02,219
How do you take care of the kids?

778
00:32:02,219 --> 00:32:03,779
They went missing all of a sudden.

779
00:32:03,779 --> 00:32:05,299
If something happens to them...

780
00:32:05,299 --> 00:32:06,019
No.

781
00:32:06,019 --> 00:32:06,979
Rest assured.

782
00:32:06,979 --> 00:32:08,099
They'll take care of themselves.

783
00:32:08,099 --> 00:32:09,139
They'll be fine.

784
00:32:09,539 --> 00:32:11,499
We've got to believe in our kids.

785
00:32:11,859 --> 00:32:12,899
Mr. Xie's son is

786
00:32:12,899 --> 00:32:14,019
missing as well.

787
00:32:14,019 --> 00:32:16,659
He's as worried as we are.

788
00:32:17,419 --> 00:32:19,739
Let's go further and try to find them.

789
00:32:20,219 --> 00:32:21,059
Hurry up.

790
00:32:21,059 --> 00:32:22,259
Stay calm.

791
00:32:22,939 --> 00:32:23,339
Ji Junxing.

792
00:32:23,339 --> 00:32:24,059
Jiang Yimian.

793
00:32:24,059 --> 00:32:25,059
Xie Ang.

794
00:32:25,419 --> 00:32:27,019
Jiang Yimian, where are you?

795
00:32:28,699 --> 00:32:30,779
Why are you standing here?

796
00:32:32,059 --> 00:32:33,659
I think there's someone over there
trying to jump off the cliff.

797
00:32:40,259 --> 00:32:42,659
It looks like Liu Yin.

798
00:32:55,019 --> 00:32:55,819
Liu Yin.

799
00:32:56,579 --> 00:32:57,499
Liu Yin, don't stand there.

800
00:32:57,499 --> 00:32:58,419
It's dangerous.

801
00:33:02,299 --> 00:33:03,379
It's none of your business.

802
00:33:04,419 --> 00:33:05,979
Do you feel pressured?

803
00:33:06,699 --> 00:33:08,379
We all do as we're in Grade 12.

804
00:33:08,379 --> 00:33:09,219
What is it that bothers you?

805
00:33:09,219 --> 00:33:10,499
You can tell us about it.

806
00:33:16,019 --> 00:33:17,419
We're different.

807
00:33:20,259 --> 00:33:22,499
Your mothers won't force you
to take pills.

808
00:33:23,739 --> 00:33:25,699
They won't force you to get good grades.

809
00:33:26,819 --> 00:33:29,139
They'll never feel unsatisfied with you.

810
00:33:29,979 --> 00:33:31,699
Why must we make our parents satisfied?

811
00:33:32,219 --> 00:33:33,899
I'm not satisfied with my parents.

812
00:33:34,339 --> 00:33:35,099
Right.

813
00:33:35,099 --> 00:33:36,619
Your mom is no worse than my dad.

814
00:33:37,299 --> 00:33:39,179
It's very tough to be the son
of the Dean of Student.

815
00:33:39,619 --> 00:33:40,419
Sometimes, I even wonder

816
00:33:40,419 --> 00:33:41,779
if I'm his biological son.

817
00:33:41,819 --> 00:33:42,899
We mean it, Liu Yin.

818
00:33:43,179 --> 00:33:44,819
So is my mom.

819
00:33:45,459 --> 00:33:47,299
I just can't make her satisfied.

820
00:33:47,699 --> 00:33:48,859
When I get a bad exam grade,

821
00:33:48,859 --> 00:33:49,819
she'll scold me for being lazy.

822
00:33:49,819 --> 00:33:50,499
When I do well,

823
00:33:50,499 --> 00:33:51,779
she'll scold me

824
00:33:51,779 --> 00:33:53,499
because she's worried I'll be over-proud.

825
00:33:53,499 --> 00:33:54,259
Yes.

826
00:33:54,619 --> 00:33:56,099
So is my mom.

827
00:33:56,099 --> 00:33:57,739
Speaking of buying pills,

828
00:33:57,739 --> 00:33:59,899
she has spent a lot of money

829
00:33:59,899 --> 00:34:01,779
on the fake oral drops.

830
00:34:01,779 --> 00:34:03,539
I even got diarrhea after consuming it.

831
00:34:03,539 --> 00:34:04,539
And

832
00:34:04,539 --> 00:34:06,539
the magical hair shampoo she bought.

833
00:34:06,539 --> 00:34:08,499
I almost got bald because of it.

834
00:34:11,579 --> 00:34:12,499
Is that true?

835
00:34:12,499 --> 00:34:13,539
-It's true.
-It's true.

836
00:34:13,699 --> 00:34:14,859
We're in the same world.

837
00:34:14,859 --> 00:34:16,779
Our parents are the same.

838
00:34:18,099 --> 00:34:19,259
Let's roar out

839
00:34:19,259 --> 00:34:20,539
of our dissatisfaction

840
00:34:20,539 --> 00:34:21,299
with the parents.

841
00:34:21,299 --> 00:34:22,379
Okay, sure.

842
00:34:22,379 --> 00:34:23,299
I'll do it first.

843
00:34:25,819 --> 00:34:27,459
Xie Zhigu,

844
00:34:27,459 --> 00:34:29,619
I've put up with you for so long.

845
00:34:29,619 --> 00:34:31,259
I've got a lot of homework
to do every day.

846
00:34:31,259 --> 00:34:33,299
I even have to do the papers
you made when I come home.

847
00:34:33,699 --> 00:34:34,659
To avoid misunderstanding,

848
00:34:34,659 --> 00:34:35,979
none of those questions

849
00:34:35,979 --> 00:34:36,939
have ever been tested.

850
00:34:36,939 --> 00:34:37,899
Quiet.

851
00:34:38,179 --> 00:34:39,059
Do you hear it?

852
00:34:39,059 --> 00:34:40,579
You always ask me to work hard.

853
00:34:40,579 --> 00:34:42,299
Why didn't you work harder back then?

854
00:34:42,299 --> 00:34:43,979
If you did,
I would've become a rich kid.

855
00:34:43,979 --> 00:34:45,419
It sounds like my son.

856
00:34:45,419 --> 00:34:46,619
Xie Zhigu,

857
00:34:46,619 --> 00:34:49,099
you're such a loser!

858
00:34:49,099 --> 00:34:50,139
You brat!

859
00:34:50,139 --> 00:34:51,539
Why are you shouting at me?

860
00:34:51,539 --> 00:34:52,179
Mr. Xie,

861
00:34:52,179 --> 00:34:53,259
calm down.

862
00:34:53,259 --> 00:34:53,979
Think about it.

863
00:34:53,979 --> 00:34:54,819
At least, this proves

864
00:34:54,819 --> 00:34:55,739
that our kids are safe.

865
00:34:55,739 --> 00:34:56,179
Yes.

866
00:34:56,179 --> 00:34:56,859
That's right.

867
00:34:56,859 --> 00:34:58,099
He sounds great.

868
00:34:58,099 --> 00:35:00,019
The kids are safe.

869
00:35:00,019 --> 00:35:01,579
Nothing is better than that.

870
00:35:01,579 --> 00:35:03,299
He's stressed out due to the exam.

871
00:35:03,299 --> 00:35:04,539
It's good for him to shout it out.

872
00:35:04,539 --> 00:35:06,859
Unlike my kid who is too ingenuous.

873
00:35:10,299 --> 00:35:11,099
My turn.

874
00:35:16,619 --> 00:35:17,859
Mom!

875
00:35:18,699 --> 00:35:21,219
You always say that Chen Mo is great,

876
00:35:21,219 --> 00:35:22,579
and Ji Junxing is amazing.

877
00:35:22,979 --> 00:35:24,339
All the other kids are doing great.

878
00:35:24,339 --> 00:35:25,299
What about me?

879
00:35:25,299 --> 00:35:27,139
Why don't you compliment me?

880
00:35:27,579 --> 00:35:29,539
I'm not that bad.

881
00:35:29,939 --> 00:35:31,619
You want another son.

882
00:35:31,619 --> 00:35:33,539
I want another mother as well.

883
00:35:33,979 --> 00:35:34,379
How dare you!

884
00:35:34,379 --> 00:35:35,779
Do you hear it?

885
00:35:36,219 --> 00:35:36,699
Let's go!

886
00:35:36,699 --> 00:35:37,859
Go!

887
00:35:39,219 --> 00:35:40,979
Madam Wang,

888
00:35:40,979 --> 00:35:42,659
you don't allow me to be a fangirl.

889
00:35:42,659 --> 00:35:44,819
Yet, you always watch talent shows.

890
00:35:44,819 --> 00:35:46,379
You don't allow me
to go out and have fun.

891
00:35:46,379 --> 00:35:48,819
Yet, you play mahjong
when you come back from work.

892
00:35:49,099 --> 00:35:50,659
When you want to control me,

893
00:35:50,659 --> 00:35:52,059
you'll say I'm still a kid.

894
00:35:52,059 --> 00:35:53,139
Otherwise,

895
00:35:53,139 --> 00:35:55,339
you'll say I'm already a grown-up.

896
00:35:55,339 --> 00:35:58,179
You're all liars
who have double standards.

897
00:36:01,339 --> 00:36:02,419
It feels refreshing.

898
00:36:04,339 --> 00:36:05,059
Ji Junxing,

899
00:36:05,059 --> 00:36:05,899
it's your turn.

900
00:36:06,699 --> 00:36:08,739
Ji Junxing has good parents.

901
00:36:08,739 --> 00:36:09,899
There's nothing to complain about.

902
00:36:20,659 --> 00:36:21,379
Dad!

903
00:36:22,659 --> 00:36:24,619
I want to go to Jinghua University.

904
00:36:24,619 --> 00:36:26,019
It's indeed for a selfish reason.

905
00:36:26,019 --> 00:36:27,539
I want to be

906
00:36:27,539 --> 00:36:29,179
with my favorite friends. So what?

907
00:36:30,019 --> 00:36:31,979
Weren't you like this back then?

908
00:36:31,979 --> 00:36:33,259
You wanted to start a business.

909
00:36:33,739 --> 00:36:34,779
My grandpa didn't allow you.

910
00:36:34,779 --> 00:36:36,179
But you still did it.

911
00:36:37,659 --> 00:36:38,899
You wanted to marry my mother.

912
00:36:38,899 --> 00:36:40,059
My grandma disagreed with it.

913
00:36:40,059 --> 00:36:41,739
But you still married her.

914
00:36:42,259 --> 00:36:43,219
Dad!

915
00:36:44,299 --> 00:36:45,419
You can make choices

916
00:36:45,419 --> 00:36:47,139
for your own life.

917
00:36:47,739 --> 00:36:49,059
Why can't I do

918
00:36:49,059 --> 00:36:51,539
the same thing?

919
00:36:53,299 --> 00:36:54,539
Look, Liu Yin.

920
00:36:54,539 --> 00:36:55,339
There are times when we have

921
00:36:55,339 --> 00:36:56,659
a disagreement with our parents.

922
00:36:56,659 --> 00:36:57,939
You can try and roar out

923
00:36:57,939 --> 00:36:58,579
of your dissatisfaction.

924
00:36:58,579 --> 00:36:59,779
Give it a try.

925
00:36:59,779 --> 00:37:01,419
It'll make you feel better.

926
00:37:01,419 --> 00:37:02,699
Try it. Go on.

927
00:37:02,699 --> 00:37:03,699
Give it a go.

928
00:37:04,139 --> 00:37:05,139
Try it.

929
00:37:23,579 --> 00:37:25,579
Mom,

930
00:37:27,339 --> 00:37:30,059
you want me to go to college
as you didn't get to do it.

931
00:37:30,779 --> 00:37:32,139
You want me to realize

932
00:37:32,139 --> 00:37:33,899
your unfulfilled dream.

933
00:37:34,499 --> 00:37:36,139
You're dissatisfied with your life.

934
00:37:36,139 --> 00:37:38,899
Why must you want me to change it?

935
00:37:40,059 --> 00:37:42,499
Have you ever thought of me?

936
00:37:43,219 --> 00:37:45,579
Do you really love me?

937
00:37:47,059 --> 00:37:50,219
You always make me do this and that.

938
00:37:50,219 --> 00:37:51,499
Because of that,

939
00:37:51,499 --> 00:37:53,459
I always imagine jumping
off the school building.

940
00:37:56,259 --> 00:37:58,619
I really can't take it anymore.

941
00:38:13,579 --> 00:38:14,739
You're the best.

942
00:38:15,859 --> 00:38:16,779
Stop crying.

943
00:38:16,779 --> 00:38:17,659
It's alright.

944
00:38:17,979 --> 00:38:19,019
Liu Yin!

945
00:38:19,659 --> 00:38:20,699
Liu Yin!

946
00:38:21,539 --> 00:38:22,579
Liu Yin!

947
00:38:26,419 --> 00:38:27,539
Come down here, Liu Yin.

948
00:38:27,779 --> 00:38:28,499
Go.

949
00:38:37,699 --> 00:38:38,499
Liu Yin.

950
00:38:41,819 --> 00:38:44,099
How could I not love you?

951
00:38:44,099 --> 00:38:45,379
I just

952
00:38:46,699 --> 00:38:49,299
don't want you to suffer like I do.

953
00:38:49,819 --> 00:38:50,659
Mom.

954
00:38:51,339 --> 00:38:52,179
Mom.

955
00:39:14,219 --> 00:39:15,059
Go.

956
00:39:32,139 --> 00:39:34,019
So this is your study group.

957
00:39:34,859 --> 00:39:35,539
Skip classes.

958
00:39:35,979 --> 00:39:36,859
Scold people.

959
00:39:37,499 --> 00:39:40,299
I'm impressed.

960
00:39:40,819 --> 00:39:42,219
It's not what they're usually like.

961
00:39:42,699 --> 00:39:43,899
They're not usually like this.

962
00:39:44,499 --> 00:39:46,099
All of you have a mind of your own now.

963
00:39:46,819 --> 00:39:48,179
You think you've grown up.

964
00:39:48,539 --> 00:39:50,019
You can ignore
what your parents say.

965
00:39:50,499 --> 00:39:51,819
We, as parents,

966
00:39:52,219 --> 00:39:54,019
don't understand you, right?

967
00:39:54,419 --> 00:39:56,339
We're not kids anymore.

968
00:39:56,339 --> 00:39:58,699
There are many things
that we can make our own decisions.

969
00:39:58,699 --> 00:40:00,339
You'll encounter problems
sooner or later.

970
00:40:01,059 --> 00:40:02,019
Just let us be.

971
00:40:07,459 --> 00:40:08,179
Dad,

972
00:40:08,179 --> 00:40:10,059
didn't you always say

973
00:40:10,059 --> 00:40:11,779
that there won't be

974
00:40:12,059 --> 00:40:14,179
a memorable youth without a bumpy life?

975
00:40:14,779 --> 00:40:15,659
Dad,

976
00:40:15,659 --> 00:40:16,779
I really...

977
00:40:23,939 --> 00:40:25,939
Since you're so sure

978
00:40:25,939 --> 00:40:27,099
of your own decision,

979
00:40:27,939 --> 00:40:29,819
just go ahead.

980
00:40:31,979 --> 00:40:32,659
Dad,

981
00:40:33,099 --> 00:40:34,299
you're saying

982
00:40:34,739 --> 00:40:36,299
that you allow me
to go to Jinghua University?

983
00:40:39,259 --> 00:40:40,299
Don't come to me

984
00:40:40,779 --> 00:40:41,739
if you regret it.

985
00:40:43,339 --> 00:40:44,299
Thanks, Dad.

986
00:40:44,579 --> 00:40:45,619
Well, Dad...

987
00:40:46,539 --> 00:40:47,219
Sit properly.

988
00:40:47,459 --> 00:40:48,259
Sure.
