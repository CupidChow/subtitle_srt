=Episode 1=

17
00:01:58,560 --> 00:02:01,400
(Work hard for three years
in return of a lifetime happiness)

18
00:02:01,400 --> 00:02:03,671
Work hard for three years
in return of a lifetime happiness.

19
00:02:03,911 --> 00:02:05,111
You even brought this.

20
00:02:05,511 --> 00:02:06,631
This is the crucial prop

21
00:02:06,631 --> 00:02:08,591
that witnessed your love journey.

22
00:02:08,831 --> 00:02:10,551
How can you take
the wedding photos without it?

23
00:02:11,391 --> 00:02:12,351
Everything is ready,

24
00:02:12,351 --> 00:02:13,311
except for the groom.

25
00:02:13,871 --> 00:02:14,911
So,

26
00:02:15,071 --> 00:02:16,031
where is he?

27
00:02:16,431 --> 00:02:18,031
Why isn't he here yet?

28
00:02:18,631 --> 00:02:19,391
(Hey, you guys,)

29
00:02:19,471 --> 00:02:20,191
(what are you doing?)

30
00:02:20,591 --> 00:02:21,271
We're screwed.

31
00:02:29,711 --> 00:02:30,471
(You guys,)

32
00:02:30,551 --> 00:02:31,271
(what are you doing?)

33
00:02:32,471 --> 00:02:33,351
Lin Xi.

34
00:02:33,551 --> 00:02:34,511
You scared me.

35
00:02:34,511 --> 00:02:35,391
I thought they got caught.

36
00:02:35,831 --> 00:02:38,111
Mr. Xie's despotic power is indeed
as strong as always.

37
00:02:38,231 --> 00:02:39,191
I'm going to give them

38
00:02:39,191 --> 00:02:40,231
this surprise as a gift.

39
00:02:40,351 --> 00:02:41,591
Remember to capture the moment.

40
00:02:42,231 --> 00:02:44,071
You guys are really connected.

41
00:02:44,391 --> 00:02:45,711
He prepares a gift for you as well.

42
00:02:46,151 --> 00:02:46,911
What is it?

43
00:02:48,071 --> 00:02:48,831
Lin Xi.

44
00:03:04,951 --> 00:03:06,151
Hey, you guys.

45
00:03:09,951 --> 00:03:12,311
(He and I have always been like this.)

46
00:03:13,031 --> 00:03:15,431
(We always start something
in an unexpected way,)

47
00:03:16,231 --> 00:03:18,111
(whether it's today)

48
00:03:18,351 --> 00:03:19,711
(or that day when we first met.)

49
00:03:20,671 --> 00:03:22,231
(Sometimes, youth is like)

50
00:03:22,231 --> 00:03:24,111
(a wool that's broken by the cat.)

51
00:03:24,351 --> 00:03:26,911
(It's messy, weird and haphazard.)

52
00:03:27,791 --> 00:03:29,431
(But I'm lucky enough)

53
00:03:29,431 --> 00:03:30,911
(to meet him at the right time.)

54
00:03:34,031 --> 00:03:35,551
(Thanks for the mistaken fate.)

55
00:03:36,271 --> 00:03:38,760
(Thanks for the summer
when we were sixteen.)

=Time and Him are Just Right=

(Eight years ago)

58
00:04:29,311 --> 00:04:30,271
It's been a long time.

59
00:04:31,471 --> 00:04:32,431
How are you?

60
00:04:36,551 --> 00:04:37,631
I think you've got
the wrong person.

61
00:04:38,311 --> 00:04:39,351
You're Ji Junxing.

62
00:04:40,751 --> 00:04:41,351
Yes.

63
00:04:42,631 --> 00:04:43,551
Then, I'm right.

64
00:05:04,551 --> 00:05:05,311
What are you doing?

65
00:05:05,711 --> 00:05:06,751
Do I know you?

66
00:05:13,951 --> 00:05:14,831
My God!

67
00:05:14,911 --> 00:05:15,511
It's a kicker.

68
00:05:15,511 --> 00:05:16,911
Are the girls nowadays this crazy?

69
00:05:17,111 --> 00:05:17,991
Come, let me interview you.

70
00:05:18,111 --> 00:05:19,191
How do you feel now?

71
00:05:19,191 --> 00:05:19,911
Good morning, Mr. Xie.

72
00:05:19,911 --> 00:05:20,551
Good morning, Dad.

73
00:05:21,351 --> 00:05:22,311
Good morning, Son.

74
00:05:23,271 --> 00:05:24,351
You prank me again.

77

We've got a transfer student.

78
00:05:40,511 --> 00:05:41,591
Introduce yourself.

79
00:05:45,071 --> 00:05:46,831
Hello, I'm Lin Xi.

80
00:05:46,951 --> 00:05:48,751
L for Lima, I for India, N for November,
X for X-ray, I for India.

81
00:05:55,951 --> 00:05:57,511
(I transfer to Chunhui High School)

82
00:05:58,071 --> 00:05:59,351
(because of him,)

83
00:06:00,560 --> 00:06:02,720
(the recipient of my brother's heart,)

84
00:06:03,360 --> 00:06:04,400
(Ji Junxing.)

85
00:06:05,080 --> 00:06:07,040
(I want to know him,)

86
00:06:07,040 --> 00:06:07,960
(accompany him)

87
00:06:08,680 --> 00:06:10,960
(and become his best friend.)

88
00:06:11,360 --> 00:06:14,920
(As if my brother was still by my side.)

89
00:06:19,440 --> 00:06:20,480
Lin Xi.

90
00:06:25,640 --> 00:06:27,360
I got transferred here
from another city.

91
00:06:27,360 --> 00:06:28,160
In the following two years,

92
00:06:28,160 --> 00:06:29,800
I wish to get along with you.

93
00:06:30,600 --> 00:06:31,280
Welcome.

94
00:06:35,920 --> 00:06:36,400
Okay.

95
00:06:39,280 --> 00:06:40,520
Let's find a seat for you.

96
00:06:41,320 --> 00:06:41,760
Miss,

97
00:06:42,280 --> 00:06:43,480
can I sit there?

98
00:06:46,640 --> 00:06:47,160
Miss,

99
00:06:47,440 --> 00:06:49,000
I'm not used to sharing
the table with others.

100
00:06:54,880 --> 00:06:55,480
Quiet.

101
00:06:55,680 --> 00:06:56,440
We're having class.

102
00:06:58,400 --> 00:06:59,400
You sit there first.

103
00:06:59,400 --> 00:07:00,560
There's no other seat.

104
00:07:00,800 --> 00:07:01,720
Let's begin the class.

105
00:07:02,240 --> 00:07:03,680
Open your textbook to page 40.

106
00:07:08,200 --> 00:07:09,520
New semester and new weather.

107
00:07:09,520 --> 00:07:10,560
As the top students,

108
00:07:10,560 --> 00:07:12,560
you need to be the role models
of the school.

109
00:07:27,689 --> 00:07:30,127
(About what happened at the carport,
don't get me wrong.)

110
00:07:31,789 --> 00:07:33,889
(That was a friend hug.
I just wanted to be your friend.)

111
00:07:38,760 --> 00:07:39,160
Pen.

112
00:07:42,840 --> 00:07:43,720
The one on the floor.

113
00:07:50,520 --> 00:07:51,680
Sorry, sorry.

114
00:07:51,760 --> 00:07:52,600
I'm sorry.

115
00:07:52,600 --> 00:07:53,440
Sorry.

116
00:07:53,960 --> 00:07:55,080
Newcomer, you don't

117
00:07:55,440 --> 00:07:57,160
have the book.
Share it with your tablemate.

118
00:08:20,240 --> 00:08:20,680
Mate,

119
00:08:21,680 --> 00:08:23,920
Miss Sun asked you
to show me around,

120
00:08:24,320 --> 00:08:26,080
not to take me to a footrace.

121
00:08:26,400 --> 00:08:27,600
Can you slow down?

122
00:08:28,240 --> 00:08:29,640
You've put on the uniform
and taken the books.

123
00:08:29,640 --> 00:08:31,440
The class is about to start.
Let's go.

124
00:08:31,440 --> 00:08:32,400
I can't run.

125
00:08:32,960 --> 00:08:34,120
I've got short legs.

126
00:08:34,320 --> 00:08:35,760
Having short legs is not
what slows you down.

127
00:08:35,760 --> 00:08:37,120
Corgi is pretty fast when it runs.

128
00:08:37,120 --> 00:08:38,920
A Corgi has four legs.

129
00:08:39,120 --> 00:08:40,360
I only have two.

130
00:08:41,320 --> 00:08:42,520
You can't run farther, can you?

131
00:08:43,320 --> 00:08:44,920
The map is here. See for yourself.

132
00:08:45,440 --> 00:08:45,960
Hey,

133
00:08:47,760 --> 00:08:49,200
can I ask you a question?

134
00:08:50,600 --> 00:08:51,080
Go ahead.

135
00:08:55,160 --> 00:08:55,840
Well,

136
00:08:56,760 --> 00:08:57,680
do you have

137
00:08:58,720 --> 00:09:00,480
a kind of special feeling for me?

138
00:09:05,560 --> 00:09:06,320
Mate,

139
00:09:06,560 --> 00:09:07,600
is talking nonsense

140
00:09:07,600 --> 00:09:08,760
your hobby?

141
00:09:09,840 --> 00:09:10,440
Fine.

142
00:09:10,960 --> 00:09:12,000
It means no.

143
00:09:15,600 --> 00:09:16,000
You...

144
00:09:16,640 --> 00:09:16,960
You...

145
00:09:17,400 --> 00:09:18,280
Don't run.

146
00:09:18,720 --> 00:09:19,480
Slow down.

147
00:09:20,040 --> 00:09:20,440
I...

148
00:09:21,760 --> 00:09:22,360
Ji Junxing.

149
00:09:26,440 --> 00:09:27,080
Hello, Sir.

150
00:09:31,040 --> 00:09:32,440
Why are you running so fast?

151
00:09:32,760 --> 00:09:36,080
What's wrong with your mental qualities?

152
00:09:37,240 --> 00:09:38,160
You have good mental qualities.

153
00:09:38,160 --> 00:09:39,200
So you can walk slowly.

154
00:09:50,800 --> 00:09:51,440
Thank you.

155
00:09:52,800 --> 00:09:53,400
Actually,

156
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:55,160
you're quite nice.

157
00:09:55,400 --> 00:09:56,800
But you always pull a long face.

158
00:09:57,280 --> 00:09:58,640
You don't have to butter me up.

159
00:09:59,520 --> 00:10:01,040
Just figure out how to face Mr. Xie.

160
00:10:01,200 --> 00:10:02,040
Mr. Xie?

161
00:10:02,400 --> 00:10:03,440
Is he scary?

162
00:10:04,320 --> 00:10:05,240
You'll find that out later.

163
00:10:18,240 --> 00:10:20,320
So he just wants us to answer
questions on the blackboard.

164
00:10:20,320 --> 00:10:21,720
It's not that scary.

165
00:10:25,920 --> 00:10:27,120
Mr. Xie, I'm done.

166
00:10:32,640 --> 00:10:33,480
Very well.

167
00:10:33,880 --> 00:10:36,200
The two students have
different problem-solving ideas,

168
00:10:36,360 --> 00:10:38,560
but they got the correct answers.

169
00:10:38,560 --> 00:10:40,200
You seem to have previewed
the knowledge points.

170
00:10:40,200 --> 00:10:41,360
It's commendable.

171
00:10:48,080 --> 00:10:48,800
Out!

172
00:11:00,880 --> 00:11:02,920
(After bringing in a new magnitude,)

173
00:11:02,920 --> 00:11:04,680
(the first thing to think about is)

174
00:11:04,680 --> 00:11:07,080
(how to stipulate its equivalency,
isn't it?)

175
00:11:07,840 --> 00:11:09,880
(This is the foundation
of the discussion about this magnitude.)

176
00:11:09,880 --> 00:11:11,840
Why did he kick us out
even when we answered it correctly?

177
00:11:12,080 --> 00:11:14,520
His nickname is Ultraman.

178
00:11:15,400 --> 00:11:16,720
I've already told you.

179
00:11:18,840 --> 00:11:20,720
I should go and explain to him,

180
00:11:20,880 --> 00:11:22,920
that you were late
because you helped me get the books.

181
00:11:23,480 --> 00:11:24,440
It won't change a thing.

182
00:11:25,160 --> 00:11:26,120
We're already punished.

183
00:11:26,520 --> 00:11:27,160
It can at least change

184
00:11:27,160 --> 00:11:28,520
Mr. Xie's opinion of you.

185
00:11:28,520 --> 00:11:29,200
It's not necessary.

186
00:11:29,840 --> 00:11:30,720
I don't care.

187
00:11:43,400 --> 00:11:44,120
Sorry.

188
00:11:47,120 --> 00:11:47,920
I... I...

189
00:11:47,920 --> 00:11:48,480
Don't.

190
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:49,880
I'm already grateful

191
00:11:49,880 --> 00:11:51,240
that you didn't pull my trousers.

192
00:12:04,360 --> 00:12:05,040
Hey,

193
00:12:05,360 --> 00:12:06,640
are you alright?

194
00:12:08,360 --> 00:12:09,160
I'm alright.

195
00:12:09,960 --> 00:12:12,160
I'm fine as long as you leave me alone.

196
00:12:13,240 --> 00:12:14,480
Okay, no problem.

197
00:12:17,880 --> 00:12:20,040
It should have a time limit.

198
00:12:20,400 --> 00:12:21,720
Can we still be friends?

199
00:12:23,120 --> 00:12:24,760
Why are you so persistent?

200
00:12:26,160 --> 00:12:27,040
Do I know you?

201
00:12:28,240 --> 00:12:30,160
You can't say that.

202
00:12:30,360 --> 00:12:32,000
But we're kind of acquaintances.

203
00:12:33,080 --> 00:12:34,000
Are you toying with me?

204
00:12:34,200 --> 00:12:34,840
No.

205
00:12:37,320 --> 00:12:39,200
This is complicated.

206
00:12:39,280 --> 00:12:40,840
It's tough to say.

207
00:12:40,840 --> 00:12:42,280
Then, forget about it.

208
00:12:42,920 --> 00:12:43,480
Anyway,

209
00:12:44,520 --> 00:12:46,120
I don't want to be your friend.

210
00:12:46,400 --> 00:12:47,440
Do you understand me?

211
00:13:02,320 --> 00:13:03,400
Why are you staring at me?

212
00:13:05,240 --> 00:13:06,640
I'd like to try again.

213
00:13:06,800 --> 00:13:07,520
Friends should be made

214
00:13:07,520 --> 00:13:09,440
through a consensual approach.

215
00:13:10,160 --> 00:13:10,880
Tell me.

216
00:13:10,960 --> 00:13:12,240
What should I do to be your friend?

217
00:13:12,520 --> 00:13:14,280
Why don't you present
your term to me?

218
00:13:14,600 --> 00:13:16,600
I'll lose if I can't do it.

219
00:13:16,600 --> 00:13:17,960
I won't bother you again if I lose.

220
00:13:17,960 --> 00:13:18,600
Will it do?

221
00:13:20,440 --> 00:13:21,760
You won't bother me again
if you lose?

222
00:13:21,760 --> 00:13:22,480
I promise.

223
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:26,640
Okay.

224
00:13:27,480 --> 00:13:29,040
If you want to be my friend,

225
00:13:29,400 --> 00:13:30,120
firstly,

226
00:13:31,600 --> 00:13:33,120
the fallen leaves will have
to fly to the sky.

227
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:36,560
Secondly,

228
00:13:37,520 --> 00:13:39,080
the stars will fall to the ground.

229
00:13:43,840 --> 00:13:44,400
(Okay.)

230
00:13:44,720 --> 00:13:45,880
(Class dismissed, students.)

231
00:13:54,440 --> 00:13:55,160
You may go in.

232
00:14:01,720 --> 00:14:02,240
Also,

233
00:14:04,040 --> 00:14:05,120
do you know that Mr. Xie is

234
00:14:05,120 --> 00:14:05,960
wearing a wig?

235
00:14:20,720 --> 00:14:22,520
You're such a cruel person.

236
00:14:22,520 --> 00:14:23,280
You can say

237
00:14:23,280 --> 00:14:24,320
that my dad is bad at teaching

238
00:14:24,440 --> 00:14:26,120
but you can't say that he's bald.

239
00:14:26,280 --> 00:14:27,600
I didn't ask her to take it for real.

240
00:14:27,920 --> 00:14:29,200
I just want her

241
00:14:29,360 --> 00:14:30,760
to extricate herself from me.

242
00:14:31,200 --> 00:14:32,600
(Wow, it's stunning.)

243
00:14:32,600 --> 00:14:34,160
(It's like the movie "Up".)

244
00:14:56,840 --> 00:14:57,680
What's going on?

245
00:14:57,680 --> 00:14:58,680
Xing, come check this out.

246
00:15:44,320 --> 00:15:45,960
It's recess time.

247
00:15:45,960 --> 00:15:47,320
Why are you here?

248
00:15:47,480 --> 00:15:48,360
Break it up.

249
00:15:52,600 --> 00:15:53,800
She got him.

250
00:15:59,040 --> 00:15:59,680
Did you see it?

251
00:15:59,880 --> 00:16:01,440
The leaves can actually fly to the sky.

252
00:16:02,200 --> 00:16:02,880
I saw it.

253
00:16:03,160 --> 00:16:04,640
You can't use the balloons

254
00:16:04,640 --> 00:16:05,840
for the entrance ceremony like this.

255
00:16:05,880 --> 00:16:06,480
Besides,

256
00:16:06,480 --> 00:16:07,720
you're using the outer force.

257
00:16:08,160 --> 00:16:09,800
You didn't say it's forbidden.

258
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:11,560
This is not clearly defined.

259
00:16:11,560 --> 00:16:13,280
It's too late to change it.

260
00:16:14,760 --> 00:16:15,360
Fine.

261
00:16:15,840 --> 00:16:16,560
This time,

262
00:16:17,480 --> 00:16:18,280
I'll consider it a success.

263
00:16:20,200 --> 00:16:21,760
I'm a bit curious now.

264
00:16:21,920 --> 00:16:23,520
What are you going to do

265
00:16:23,520 --> 00:16:25,080
to make the stars fall to the ground?

266
00:16:26,440 --> 00:16:27,080
Follow me.

267
00:16:27,080 --> 00:16:27,760
What are you doing?

268
00:16:28,480 --> 00:16:29,240
Let's go.

269
00:16:29,240 --> 00:16:30,280
It's not the time for class.

270
00:16:30,280 --> 00:16:31,440
I'll show you the stars.

271
00:16:33,840 --> 00:16:35,080
Why do you bring me here?

272
00:16:35,680 --> 00:16:36,800
There's no star here.

273
00:16:39,160 --> 00:16:39,840
Close your eyes.

274
00:16:40,360 --> 00:16:41,280
Why would I do that?

275
00:16:41,560 --> 00:16:42,200
Close your eyes.

276
00:16:43,200 --> 00:16:43,840
Close your eyes.

277
00:16:51,120 --> 00:16:51,640
What are you doing?

278
00:16:56,760 --> 00:16:57,160
Okay.

279
00:16:57,720 --> 00:16:58,520
Now,

280
00:16:58,680 --> 00:17:00,080
you can open your eyes.

281
00:17:02,560 --> 00:17:03,120
Stars.

282
00:17:06,920 --> 00:17:08,360
This crystal is sparkling

283
00:17:08,360 --> 00:17:09,560
in the dark.

284
00:17:12,560 --> 00:17:13,640
It's as beautiful as the stars.

285
00:17:15,400 --> 00:17:16,680
Don't put words in my mouth.

286
00:17:16,960 --> 00:17:18,120
This is not a star.

287
00:17:19,120 --> 00:17:20,320
It's easy to find a real one.

288
00:17:20,480 --> 00:17:21,520
It's just a meteor.

289
00:17:21,600 --> 00:17:22,440
We can find it in the museum.

290
00:17:23,880 --> 00:17:25,600
I've passed it, right?

291
00:17:28,040 --> 00:17:29,200
You barely pass it.

292
00:17:30,520 --> 00:17:31,920
I guess that just leaves Mr. Xie's wig.

293
00:17:33,240 --> 00:17:34,320
I have to emphasize

294
00:17:34,720 --> 00:17:36,320
that it's Mr. Xie's hair.

295
00:17:36,560 --> 00:17:38,120
It's not the hair of some sort

296
00:17:38,120 --> 00:17:39,280
of statue, mannequin or stand.

297
00:17:39,600 --> 00:17:40,760
Don't try to take advantage
of the loopholes.

298
00:17:41,120 --> 00:17:42,200
I got it.

299
00:17:42,200 --> 00:17:43,560
The final interpretation belongs to you.

300
00:17:43,880 --> 00:17:45,120
I have to remind you this.

301
00:17:45,480 --> 00:17:47,600
It's not too late to regret it now.

302
00:17:48,600 --> 00:17:49,120
What's wrong?

303
00:17:49,560 --> 00:17:50,440
Do you regret it?

304
00:17:51,560 --> 00:17:52,720
I just want to tell you

305
00:17:53,080 --> 00:17:54,080
that it's meaningless

306
00:17:54,640 --> 00:17:55,520
to be friends with me.

307
00:17:56,960 --> 00:17:57,680
You don't understand.

308
00:17:57,840 --> 00:17:58,800
This is my wish.

309
00:17:59,160 --> 00:18:00,640
It's more important
than going to college.

310
00:18:02,960 --> 00:18:03,760
Fine.

311
00:18:04,320 --> 00:18:05,080
Suit yourself.

312
00:18:27,160 --> 00:18:27,800
Lin Xi,

313
00:18:28,480 --> 00:18:29,560
why are you alone?

314
00:18:29,560 --> 00:18:30,320
Let's eat together.

315
00:18:32,200 --> 00:18:33,880
You're the student
in front of me, Jiang...

316
00:18:33,880 --> 00:18:34,480
Jiang Yimian.

317
00:18:35,440 --> 00:18:36,840
You ordered Sour and Spicy Beef Sliced?

318
00:18:37,800 --> 00:18:39,000
Obviously, you're inexperienced.

319
00:18:39,200 --> 00:18:40,880
This dish is a bomb.

320
00:18:41,160 --> 00:18:42,920
The soup is not sour enough
and the beef is too little.

321
00:18:42,920 --> 00:18:44,000
And it's all Enoki mushrooms.

322
00:18:44,240 --> 00:18:45,440
Try my Sichuan Boiled Fish.

323
00:18:45,600 --> 00:18:48,120
This is the soul of Chunhui Canteen.

324
00:18:53,320 --> 00:18:53,920
It's delicious.

325
00:18:54,240 --> 00:18:55,280
How did you know so many things?

326
00:18:55,600 --> 00:18:57,000
I'm a veteran in Chunhui.

327
00:18:57,160 --> 00:18:58,440
I came here straight
from the middle school.

328
00:18:58,520 --> 00:19:00,240
I know everything about the school.

329
00:19:00,320 --> 00:19:01,320
As you just got transferred here,

330
00:19:01,320 --> 00:19:02,280
you're not familiar
with the environment.

331
00:19:02,280 --> 00:19:03,840
Feel free to ask me anything
that you don't know.

332
00:19:05,720 --> 00:19:06,200
Well,

333
00:19:06,560 --> 00:19:08,000
I'd like to ask about one person.

334
00:19:08,680 --> 00:19:09,720
Ji Junxing, is it?

335
00:19:10,440 --> 00:19:13,160
He's the top handsome guy
recognized in Chunhui.

336
00:19:13,320 --> 00:19:14,560
The point is he has good grades.

337
00:19:15,440 --> 00:19:16,080
No,

338
00:19:16,400 --> 00:19:17,440
I'm not asking about him.

339
00:19:17,920 --> 00:19:19,080
I'd like to ask about Mr. Xie.

340
00:19:19,280 --> 00:19:20,720
A wolf in sheep's clothing.
The Demogorgon.

341
00:19:20,800 --> 00:19:22,120
Didn't you already experience it?

342
00:19:24,360 --> 00:19:26,760
How could I take
the Demogorgon's wig off?

343
00:19:34,160 --> 00:19:35,120
Ji Junxing is not trying

344
00:19:35,120 --> 00:19:36,360
to be friends with you.

345
00:19:36,840 --> 00:19:38,400
He's making you transfer again.

346
00:19:43,520 --> 00:19:45,400
Classes, attention, please.

347
00:19:45,800 --> 00:19:47,360
In order to welcome
the Education Bureau authority,

348
00:19:47,360 --> 00:19:48,840
we'll clean up the school

349
00:19:48,840 --> 00:19:50,560
in the third period class
this afternoon.

350
00:19:50,920 --> 00:19:52,640
Each homeroom teacher,
please lead the students

351
00:19:52,640 --> 00:19:53,880
to actively prepare for it.

352
00:20:03,960 --> 00:20:04,560
Ji Junxing.

353
00:20:06,120 --> 00:20:06,960
Ji Junxing.

354
00:20:07,440 --> 00:20:08,520
What do you want?

355
00:20:08,640 --> 00:20:09,360
Well,

356
00:20:09,920 --> 00:20:11,040
about the third terms,

357
00:20:11,360 --> 00:20:12,440
can you change it?

358
00:20:12,760 --> 00:20:13,280
What's wrong?

359
00:20:13,440 --> 00:20:14,520
You can't do it?

360
00:20:14,840 --> 00:20:17,080
It's not that I can't.
I just don't want to.

361
00:20:17,680 --> 00:20:18,720
It means

362
00:20:19,040 --> 00:20:20,040
you give up.

363
00:20:20,520 --> 00:20:21,320
No, no.

364
00:20:21,480 --> 00:20:22,520
Just change it to another term.

365
00:20:23,600 --> 00:20:24,760
I can do anything for you.

366
00:20:25,920 --> 00:20:27,000
I'll help you mop the floor.

367
00:20:29,640 --> 00:20:30,680
It's useless.

368
00:20:30,840 --> 00:20:33,440
Three terms must be fulfilled,
no deals.

369
00:20:33,880 --> 00:20:35,720
It's alright. I'll do my best.

370
00:20:35,720 --> 00:20:36,760
I promise I'll mop the floor

371
00:20:36,760 --> 00:20:38,200
until it causes slip.

372
00:20:39,040 --> 00:20:40,520
Please think about it.

373
00:20:54,360 --> 00:20:55,160
What are you doing?

374
00:20:55,160 --> 00:20:56,120
The character has just showed up.

375
00:20:56,120 --> 00:20:56,920
You freak me out.

376
00:20:57,640 --> 00:20:58,440
No matter how you read it,

377
00:20:58,440 --> 00:20:59,800
the character can't do
the works for you.

378
00:21:00,400 --> 00:21:01,120
We've agreed

379
00:21:01,280 --> 00:21:02,600
that I sweep the floor, and you'll

380
00:21:03,120 --> 00:21:03,840
take out the garbage.

381
00:21:05,760 --> 00:21:06,680
Sorry.

382
00:21:06,840 --> 00:21:08,200
I'm on my period.

383
00:21:08,320 --> 00:21:09,440
I can't climb the stairs.

384
00:21:10,640 --> 00:21:12,360
During the PE class the week before,

385
00:21:12,960 --> 00:21:14,280
didn't you already have your period?

386
00:21:15,680 --> 00:21:16,840
Xie Ang,

387
00:21:17,360 --> 00:21:18,520
you pay a lot of attention to me.

388
00:21:19,080 --> 00:21:20,600
Your new shoes look a bit dirty.

389
00:21:20,800 --> 00:21:21,680
Let me help you sweep it.

390
00:21:21,680 --> 00:21:21,920
Don't.

391
00:21:22,160 --> 00:21:22,920
Just take it out on me.

392
00:21:22,920 --> 00:21:23,800
My shoes are innocent.

393
00:21:24,600 --> 00:21:26,080
We normally care a lot about educating

394
00:21:26,080 --> 00:21:27,640
the students into high-quality talent.

395
00:21:27,840 --> 00:21:28,400
Look.

396
00:21:28,760 --> 00:21:29,800
The students in Chunhui

397
00:21:30,080 --> 00:21:30,960
study well.

398
00:21:31,240 --> 00:21:33,080
They're also actively involved
in labour matters.

399
00:21:33,080 --> 00:21:34,160
They don't slack off.

400
00:21:39,400 --> 00:21:41,040
The banner looks very long.

401
00:21:41,560 --> 00:21:42,240
Let me help you.

402
00:21:44,160 --> 00:21:46,720
A lifetime happiness.

403
00:21:47,640 --> 00:21:49,400
Xie Ang, stop right there!

404
00:21:49,400 --> 00:21:49,920
Slow down.

405
00:21:49,920 --> 00:21:50,760
Be careful.

406
00:21:50,800 --> 00:21:51,560
Stop!

407
00:21:51,840 --> 00:21:53,680
I'll wipe your shoes
with the broom.

408
00:21:58,720 --> 00:22:00,200
Who wiped the floor?

409
00:22:01,080 --> 00:22:02,040
Come back here.

410
00:22:35,880 --> 00:22:36,960
I'm sorry, Sir.

411
00:22:37,080 --> 00:22:38,280
What's going on?

412
00:22:38,960 --> 00:22:39,360
What happened?

413
00:22:39,360 --> 00:22:40,080
Who did this?

414
00:22:43,640 --> 00:22:44,840
Am I mistaken?

415
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:46,200
Mr. Xie's wig fell off.

416
00:22:47,480 --> 00:22:48,320
You're not mistaken.

417
00:22:49,120 --> 00:22:51,440
Does it mean I've passed the third test?

418
00:22:53,960 --> 00:22:54,560
Does it?

419
00:22:57,880 --> 00:22:59,400
Who did this?

420
00:23:03,400 --> 00:23:04,080
Very well.

421
00:23:05,880 --> 00:23:08,080
The Education Bureau authority came
to visit the campus.

422
00:23:08,280 --> 00:23:09,200
And our Class One

423
00:23:09,520 --> 00:23:11,280
prepared a huge gift like this.

424
00:23:12,120 --> 00:23:13,200
You can even put

425
00:23:13,720 --> 00:23:15,960
a banner on someone else's head.

426
00:23:18,240 --> 00:23:19,200
It's hilarious, right?

427
00:23:19,400 --> 00:23:20,440
Come, give a big laugh out of it.

428
00:23:20,440 --> 00:23:21,360
Don't hold it back.

429
00:23:21,560 --> 00:23:22,680
No one is allowed to go home

430
00:23:22,680 --> 00:23:23,680
if you don't laugh enough.

431
00:23:25,560 --> 00:23:26,400
Don't, Mr. Xie.

432
00:23:26,400 --> 00:23:27,680
Mr. Xie, it's our fault.

433
00:23:27,680 --> 00:23:28,880
We'd like to go home.

434
00:23:32,040 --> 00:23:32,800
Mr. Xie,

435
00:23:33,240 --> 00:23:35,840
it was me who dropped the banner.
It slipped out of my hands.

436
00:23:36,440 --> 00:23:37,840
Just take it out on me.

437
00:23:38,080 --> 00:23:39,120
It has nothing to do with them.

438
00:23:40,040 --> 00:23:40,640
Good.

439
00:23:41,920 --> 00:23:42,760
Mr. Xie,

440
00:23:43,320 --> 00:23:44,040
I was involved too.

441
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:46,440
Not bad.

442
00:23:47,240 --> 00:23:49,280
Both of you are responsible.

443
00:23:49,400 --> 00:23:50,000
Okay.

444
00:23:50,560 --> 00:23:51,200
Out!

445
00:23:55,560 --> 00:23:56,360
(A lifetime happiness)
Hold it tight.

446
00:23:57,080 --> 00:23:58,440
Hold it real tight this time.

447
00:23:58,640 --> 00:23:59,840
Don't put it down.

448
00:24:00,200 --> 00:24:01,440
Stand here until the class is over.

449
00:24:01,600 --> 00:24:02,720
Reflect on yourselves.

450
00:24:03,120 --> 00:24:05,560
Read the apology at the broadcast room
before school is over.

451
00:24:07,489 --> 00:24:10,609
(Work hard for three years)

452
00:24:16,400 --> 00:24:18,960
Well, we're kind of enjoying blessing

453
00:24:18,960 --> 00:24:21,760
and enduring misfortune together.

454
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:24,560
All I can see is misfortune.

455
00:24:24,800 --> 00:24:27,800
The blessing is right here.

456
00:24:28,849 --> 00:24:35,536
(A lifetime happiness)

457
00:24:38,200 --> 00:24:38,800
Well,

458
00:24:39,040 --> 00:24:40,880
the process is a bit rough

459
00:24:40,880 --> 00:24:43,000
but the three tasks are
considered completed.

460
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:45,960
I guess we're considered
to be friends now.

461
00:24:46,440 --> 00:24:47,480
What do you think?

462
00:24:48,360 --> 00:24:49,360
The first day we met,

463
00:24:49,600 --> 00:24:50,680
we've been punished twice.

464
00:24:51,840 --> 00:24:53,160
Life is like a roller coaster.

465
00:24:54,720 --> 00:24:55,880
What a blast.

466
00:24:56,120 --> 00:24:58,280
I promise
nothing will happen again today.

467
00:24:58,440 --> 00:24:59,960
It's statistically impossible.

468
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:04,640
Well,

469
00:25:04,800 --> 00:25:06,960
I'll write the apology for you.

470
00:25:07,360 --> 00:25:08,360
Thank you.

471
00:25:09,240 --> 00:25:10,000
You're welcome.

472
00:25:16,249 --> 00:25:16,719
(Unremitting self-improvement,
the unity of knowing and doing)

473
00:25:16,720 --> 00:25:17,320
Xing,

474
00:25:18,200 --> 00:25:19,280
you're so mean.

475
00:25:19,280 --> 00:25:20,400
How could you keep this from me?

476
00:25:20,640 --> 00:25:21,600
I didn't expect you

477
00:25:21,600 --> 00:25:22,720
to have this kind of relationship.

478
00:25:23,880 --> 00:25:25,520
What kind of relationship
do we have?

479
00:25:25,880 --> 00:25:26,600
Quit the act.

480
00:25:26,600 --> 00:25:28,200
The story between you is
all over the school.

481
00:25:28,880 --> 00:25:31,760
You hugged each other tight
this morning after a long separation.

482
00:25:31,760 --> 00:25:34,320
You shared old memories
while having a tour of the campus.

483
00:25:34,320 --> 00:25:35,880
And you launched balloons
this afternoon...

484
00:25:35,880 --> 00:25:36,720
Stop.

485
00:25:37,080 --> 00:25:38,360
This isn't my doing.

486
00:25:52,360 --> 00:25:53,240
Ji Junxing.

487
00:25:53,880 --> 00:25:54,480
Ji Junxing.

488
00:25:56,440 --> 00:25:58,600
Actually, the rumor can
only survive seven days.

489
00:25:58,600 --> 00:25:59,440
You don't have to care about it.

490
00:25:59,440 --> 00:26:00,960
Soon, everyone will forget about it.

491
00:26:01,360 --> 00:26:02,880
If you mind,

492
00:26:03,240 --> 00:26:04,440
I'll figure it out.

493
00:26:06,320 --> 00:26:07,040
Ji Junxing.

494
00:26:11,520 --> 00:26:12,360
Senior,

495
00:26:12,560 --> 00:26:14,080
we're here to read the apology.

496
00:26:14,320 --> 00:26:15,040
I know.

497
00:26:15,160 --> 00:26:15,880
Use this.

498
00:26:15,880 --> 00:26:16,680
Thank you.

499
00:26:26,080 --> 00:26:26,880
Hello.

500
00:26:27,560 --> 00:26:29,080
I'm Ji Junxing
from Class One, Grade Two.

501
00:26:29,800 --> 00:26:31,760
As the banner fell off
during today's cleanup,

502
00:26:32,360 --> 00:26:34,080
I was keenly aware
of my own mistake.

503
00:26:38,120 --> 00:26:40,160
This activity is a typical formalism.

504
00:26:40,480 --> 00:26:42,040
It occupies the study time
of the students.

505
00:26:42,160 --> 00:26:43,520
It's an image project.

506
00:26:43,800 --> 00:26:45,680
I shouldn't have participated in it.
I suggest we abolish it.

507
00:26:45,920 --> 00:26:47,280
This is a direct violation.

508
00:26:47,360 --> 00:26:48,440
Have you not been punished enough?

509
00:26:48,440 --> 00:26:49,600
Let me finish.

510
00:26:53,800 --> 00:26:55,760
I'd like to clear one thing here.

511
00:26:56,680 --> 00:26:59,200
Those rumors are
groundless speculations.

512
00:27:01,320 --> 00:27:02,040
There's nothing

513
00:27:05,480 --> 00:27:06,960
going on between me and her.

514
00:27:42,480 --> 00:27:43,520
Ji Junxing!

515
00:27:58,960 --> 00:27:59,680
Hello.

516
00:28:00,760 --> 00:28:02,680
I'm the transfer student
in Class One, Grade Two,

517
00:28:03,400 --> 00:28:04,080
Lin Xi.

518
00:28:05,160 --> 00:28:06,640
As a newcomer,

519
00:28:06,920 --> 00:28:09,040
I've brought many troubles to a person.

520
00:28:11,000 --> 00:28:12,080
I'd like

521
00:28:12,680 --> 00:28:14,920
to seriously say sorry

522
00:28:16,280 --> 00:28:16,960
to him.

523
00:28:20,480 --> 00:28:21,960
Indeed, he didn't know me.

524
00:28:24,120 --> 00:28:25,360
But I know him.

525
00:28:27,960 --> 00:28:29,240
I once thought

526
00:28:30,200 --> 00:28:31,920
that no matter how much I missed him,

527
00:28:32,720 --> 00:28:34,000
and how sincere I was,

528
00:28:35,200 --> 00:28:37,080
there won't be a god

529
00:28:38,040 --> 00:28:39,520
who could let me see him again.

530
00:28:41,160 --> 00:28:42,160
Unexpectedly,

531
00:28:44,400 --> 00:28:46,320
God has given me another chance.

532
00:28:48,560 --> 00:28:51,800
I'd like to drink milk tea,

533
00:28:53,440 --> 00:28:54,960
play basketball with him

534
00:28:56,200 --> 00:28:57,320
and those things

535
00:28:59,160 --> 00:29:00,240
that I want to do

536
00:29:01,680 --> 00:29:03,400
but I've never done before.

537
00:29:04,840 --> 00:29:06,080
Dad, I'll check my phone.

538
00:29:06,080 --> 00:29:06,600
Sure.

539
00:29:10,880 --> 00:29:12,320
Why isn't Brother coming?

540
00:29:12,560 --> 00:29:13,800
He doesn't call me either.

541
00:29:32,369 --> 00:29:36,169
(China Human Organ Donation
Registration Form)

542
00:29:38,560 --> 00:29:40,480
I want to share happiness

543
00:29:41,960 --> 00:29:43,640
and sadness with him.

544
00:29:45,480 --> 00:29:46,960
I want to witness

545
00:29:48,360 --> 00:29:51,960
each other's glory
and success with him.

546
00:29:54,240 --> 00:29:56,160
I'd like to be with him

547
00:29:58,320 --> 00:30:00,920
and be his friends forever.

548
00:30:02,200 --> 00:30:03,080
What are you doing?

549
00:30:24,880 --> 00:30:26,120
She's crazy.

550
00:30:41,840 --> 00:30:42,960
Mom, I'm back.

551
00:30:44,400 --> 00:30:45,080
Hi.

552
00:30:45,760 --> 00:30:47,200
Sorry that we meet again.

553
00:30:48,520 --> 00:30:49,840
Why are you in my house?

554
00:31:03,280 --> 00:31:04,320
Okay.

555
00:31:05,040 --> 00:31:05,720
Come.

556
00:31:05,800 --> 00:31:06,640
Let's eat dumplings.

557
00:31:08,280 --> 00:31:09,200
You must be hungry.

558
00:31:11,680 --> 00:31:12,440
Lin Xi,

559
00:31:12,720 --> 00:31:13,720
I've been busy

560
00:31:13,720 --> 00:31:15,280
with the art exhibition
for the past two days.

561
00:31:15,280 --> 00:31:16,680
I didn't get to prepare
a hearty meal.

562
00:31:16,840 --> 00:31:18,760
Just make do
with the instant dumplings.

563
00:31:18,760 --> 00:31:19,400
It's alright.

564
00:31:20,200 --> 00:31:21,520
It sounds like you'd prepare

565
00:31:21,520 --> 00:31:22,800
a lovely meal if you weren't busy.

566
00:31:23,800 --> 00:31:24,560
You're an expert

567
00:31:24,560 --> 00:31:27,080
in undermining me.

568
00:31:29,040 --> 00:31:29,840
Don't hold it against me.

569
00:31:30,480 --> 00:31:32,240
When I settle the art exhibition,

570
00:31:32,240 --> 00:31:34,120
I'll be sure to take you to a feast.

571
00:31:34,320 --> 00:31:35,000
It's alright, Aunt.

572
00:31:35,000 --> 00:31:36,160
I like to eat dumplings.

573
00:31:36,920 --> 00:31:37,480
Here.

574
00:31:37,480 --> 00:31:38,200
Eat more.

575
00:31:39,400 --> 00:31:41,120
How's the school environment?

576
00:31:41,120 --> 00:31:42,640
How are you fitting in
on your first day?

577
00:31:43,800 --> 00:31:47,000
The school environment,
teachers and my tablemate

578
00:31:47,000 --> 00:31:47,880
are quite nice.

579
00:31:48,320 --> 00:31:49,000
Great.

580
00:31:49,360 --> 00:31:50,320
She's not only fitting in,

581
00:31:50,720 --> 00:31:51,880
she's like a duck to water.

582
00:31:52,320 --> 00:31:53,360
She's been creating chaos.

583
00:31:54,440 --> 00:31:55,680
What do you mean?

584
00:31:56,160 --> 00:31:56,720
Aunt,

585
00:31:56,720 --> 00:31:57,320
what he means is

586
00:31:57,320 --> 00:31:59,000
that I've gotten along well
with my classmates.

587
00:31:59,560 --> 00:32:00,520
That's great.

588
00:32:00,840 --> 00:32:01,400
Lin Xi,

589
00:32:01,400 --> 00:32:02,480
you're so nice.

590
00:32:02,600 --> 00:32:04,360
Whoever doesn't get along with you,

591
00:32:04,520 --> 00:32:06,080
it must be the person's own problem.

592
00:32:06,240 --> 00:32:06,720
Don't you think?

593
00:32:09,440 --> 00:32:10,720
Here, eat more.

594
00:32:11,080 --> 00:32:12,160
After that,

595
00:32:12,200 --> 00:32:13,760
I'll show you your room.

596
00:32:14,120 --> 00:32:14,960
Thank you, Aunt.

597
00:32:17,840 --> 00:32:18,360
Mom,

598
00:32:18,720 --> 00:32:19,200
there's something

599
00:32:19,200 --> 00:32:20,320
I need to talk to you.

600
00:32:20,480 --> 00:32:21,280
Come with me.

601
00:32:24,960 --> 00:32:25,520
It's alright.

602
00:32:25,680 --> 00:32:26,560
Eat more.

603
00:32:33,600 --> 00:32:34,520
What is it?

604
00:32:34,720 --> 00:32:36,720
Mom, you said you'll show her
her room.

605
00:32:36,880 --> 00:32:37,880
Is she going to stay here tonight?

606
00:32:39,080 --> 00:32:40,000
Not tonight.

607
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:41,120
It's the entire semester.

608
00:32:41,400 --> 00:32:43,160
There's no room
in your school dorm.

609
00:32:43,560 --> 00:32:44,200
That long?

610
00:32:44,920 --> 00:32:45,720
I don't agree with it.

611
00:32:46,200 --> 00:32:47,800
This is my house.

612
00:32:47,800 --> 00:32:49,040
I don't need your permission.

613
00:32:49,600 --> 00:32:51,120
At least I have the right
to be informed.

614
00:32:51,240 --> 00:32:52,080
Who is she?

615
00:32:52,480 --> 00:32:53,600
Lower your voice.

616
00:32:54,880 --> 00:32:55,720
About this,

617
00:32:55,720 --> 00:32:57,360
I've got to talk to her dad.

618
00:32:58,840 --> 00:32:59,480
Sure.

619
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:00,760
Thank you.

620
00:33:01,120 --> 00:33:01,920
That's all for now.

621
00:33:03,160 --> 00:33:03,680
Goodbye.

622
00:33:06,960 --> 00:33:08,360
What did Ji Family say on the phone?

623
00:33:08,680 --> 00:33:09,760
They suggested

624
00:33:09,760 --> 00:33:11,960
to transfer Lin Xi
to Chunhui High School.

625
00:33:12,240 --> 00:33:14,480
They said they can help us handle
the transfer formalities.

626
00:33:16,160 --> 00:33:17,240
Their youngest son

627
00:33:17,360 --> 00:33:18,840
went abroad with his dad.

628
00:33:18,840 --> 00:33:20,240
He'll be back probably by year-end.

629
00:33:20,600 --> 00:33:22,240
They happen to have an empty room
in the house.

630
00:33:22,600 --> 00:33:25,560
They want Lin Xi to live with them
after being transferred.

631
00:33:26,480 --> 00:33:27,560
I think

632
00:33:28,240 --> 00:33:30,480
we're just their distant relatives.

633
00:33:30,480 --> 00:33:31,880
We haven't contacted
with them for a long time.

634
00:33:32,280 --> 00:33:33,560
Chunhui High School is

635
00:33:34,440 --> 00:33:35,960
a good school.

636
00:33:37,080 --> 00:33:39,000
It's a rare chance for the kid.

637
00:33:39,360 --> 00:33:40,360
I know.

638
00:33:40,560 --> 00:33:41,240
Ji Family wants

639
00:33:41,240 --> 00:33:43,840
to do something for us.

640
00:33:44,400 --> 00:33:45,480
I'm just afraid...

641
00:33:45,640 --> 00:33:47,040
I'm afraid Lin Xi would ask about it.

642
00:33:47,720 --> 00:33:49,000
How are we supposed to explain it?

643
00:33:51,680 --> 00:33:52,600
Don't tell her

644
00:33:53,560 --> 00:33:55,480
that Zheng's heart is donated

645
00:33:56,320 --> 00:33:57,440
to their kid.

646
00:33:58,040 --> 00:33:59,520
I don't want her to feel burdened.

647
00:34:00,520 --> 00:34:02,360
Just tell her...

648
00:34:02,720 --> 00:34:04,520
We're distant relatives.

649
00:34:04,520 --> 00:34:06,560
They've done us a great favor.

650
00:34:06,960 --> 00:34:07,640
What favor?

651
00:34:08,640 --> 00:34:09,920
Never mind.

652
00:34:10,000 --> 00:34:10,720
Anyway,

653
00:34:10,720 --> 00:34:12,600
as she's transferred here,

654
00:34:12,800 --> 00:34:14,440
I invite her over to live with us.

655
00:34:14,600 --> 00:34:16,560
It's kind of returning the favor.

656
00:34:17,600 --> 00:34:19,120
She'll live here for a long time.

657
00:34:19,120 --> 00:34:20,360
It's inconvenient for me.

658
00:34:21,600 --> 00:34:22,520
She's a girl.

659
00:34:22,520 --> 00:34:23,920
Even she didn't say it's inconvenient.

660
00:34:23,920 --> 00:34:26,080
Why is it so inconvenient
for a boy like you?

661
00:34:26,800 --> 00:34:27,720
Let me tell you this.

662
00:34:28,040 --> 00:34:29,440
She's staying with us now.

663
00:34:29,600 --> 00:34:31,480
Whether at home or at school,

664
00:34:31,480 --> 00:34:32,600
you have to take care of her.

665
00:34:32,760 --> 00:34:33,520
Do you hear me?

666
00:34:33,920 --> 00:34:35,880
Or I'll hold you responsible.

667
00:35:01,040 --> 00:35:02,840
You must be Ji Junxing's baby brother.

668
00:35:03,600 --> 00:35:04,720
You're more lovely than your brother.

669
00:35:17,640 --> 00:35:18,280
So comfortable.

670
00:35:22,400 --> 00:35:23,280
Can I come in?

671
00:35:24,000 --> 00:35:24,640
Sure.

672
00:35:28,240 --> 00:35:28,960
Hello, Aunt.

673
00:35:29,760 --> 00:35:30,360
Have a seat.

674
00:35:30,760 --> 00:35:32,120
I've got you some fruits.

675
00:35:32,120 --> 00:35:32,960
Thank you, Aunt.

676
00:35:33,280 --> 00:35:34,240
Aunt, please sit.

677
00:35:34,600 --> 00:35:35,120
Let me do it.

678
00:35:35,600 --> 00:35:36,160
Sit.

679
00:35:37,880 --> 00:35:38,600
Lin Xi,

680
00:35:38,720 --> 00:35:39,680
make yourself comfortable.

681
00:35:40,160 --> 00:35:41,000
Just make

682
00:35:41,000 --> 00:35:42,600
yourself at home.

683
00:35:43,400 --> 00:35:45,320
This used to be Ji Luchi's room.

684
00:35:46,120 --> 00:35:47,560
I've got two sons.

685
00:35:47,720 --> 00:35:48,600
I have no idea

686
00:35:48,600 --> 00:35:50,360
what a girl of your age likes.

687
00:35:50,560 --> 00:35:51,440
So I took the liberty

688
00:35:51,440 --> 00:35:52,880
of fixing up the room.

689
00:35:53,080 --> 00:35:54,680
Thank you, Aunt. I like it very much.

690
00:35:56,720 --> 00:35:57,880
Are you having troubles

691
00:35:57,880 --> 00:35:59,240
with Ji Junxing?

692
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:01,280
When we were eating,

693
00:36:01,280 --> 00:36:03,040
there was no interaction
between you guys.

694
00:36:04,640 --> 00:36:07,120
Maybe we're not acquainted
with each other yet.

695
00:36:10,440 --> 00:36:12,160
Ji Junxing is

696
00:36:12,240 --> 00:36:13,600
like fried yoghurt.

697
00:36:14,040 --> 00:36:15,080
On the outside,

698
00:36:15,080 --> 00:36:17,240
he's a man who's hard
to get along with.

699
00:36:17,480 --> 00:36:18,680
In fact, I know

700
00:36:18,800 --> 00:36:20,360
that he's soft-hearted.

701
00:36:20,800 --> 00:36:22,040
I also sincerely hope

702
00:36:22,040 --> 00:36:24,000
that you two could get along
with each other.

703
00:36:24,560 --> 00:36:26,480
I really want to be his good friend.

704
00:36:28,320 --> 00:36:29,120
I know.

705
00:36:29,120 --> 00:36:30,160
I believe you.

706
00:36:30,800 --> 00:36:31,640
Anyway,

707
00:36:31,640 --> 00:36:33,000
he's living right next to you.

708
00:36:33,320 --> 00:36:34,160
If you

709
00:36:34,160 --> 00:36:35,920
need his help,

710
00:36:36,200 --> 00:36:37,680
just knock on his door.

711
00:36:38,000 --> 00:36:39,400
Don't worry about troubling him.

712
00:36:39,680 --> 00:36:40,920
Rest assured. Will do.

713
00:36:42,440 --> 00:36:42,920
Okay.

714
00:36:43,080 --> 00:36:44,360
Get some rest.

715
00:36:44,600 --> 00:36:45,680
I'll stop bothering you.

716
00:36:46,760 --> 00:36:47,600
Thank you, Aunt Wen.

717
00:36:48,640 --> 00:36:49,400
Good night.

718
00:36:50,680 --> 00:36:51,360
Good night.

719
00:37:02,880 --> 00:37:03,800
You must've waited for so long.

720
00:37:04,120 --> 00:37:04,680
Look.

721
00:37:05,040 --> 00:37:07,200
This is our new room.

722
00:37:07,640 --> 00:37:08,320
How is it?

723
00:37:29,520 --> 00:37:30,200
(Brother,)

724
00:37:30,840 --> 00:37:32,000
(are you alright?)

725
00:37:34,680 --> 00:37:36,400
(This is my first time living
so far away from our family.)

726
00:37:36,920 --> 00:37:38,280
(I'm a bit homesick.)

727
00:37:40,360 --> 00:37:41,240
(Luckily, I've got)

728
00:37:41,240 --> 00:37:43,080
(the little fox that you gave me.)

729
00:37:45,520 --> 00:37:48,120
(Ji Junxing and you are
totally different.)

730
00:37:50,120 --> 00:37:51,680
(Unlike you, he doesn't like to smile.)

731
00:37:51,920 --> 00:37:53,360
(He always pulls a long face.)

732
00:37:54,760 --> 00:37:57,800
(He doesn't look happy at all.)

733
00:37:59,360 --> 00:38:01,440
Can we still be friends?

734
00:38:01,920 --> 00:38:02,840
Do I know you?

735
00:38:03,600 --> 00:38:04,280
Anyway,

736
00:38:05,240 --> 00:38:06,760
I don't want to be your friend.

737
00:38:08,360 --> 00:38:09,800
(Being friends with him)

738
00:38:10,280 --> 00:38:11,720
(is harder than I thought.)

739
00:38:14,400 --> 00:38:16,560
(It was a bad start today.)

740
00:38:17,760 --> 00:38:19,680
(He seems to hate me.)

741
00:38:21,160 --> 00:38:22,120
(But it's alright.)

742
00:38:22,360 --> 00:38:23,800
(Even if it's the Great Wall of China,)

743
00:38:23,960 --> 00:38:25,880
(I'll be sure to complete
the journey step by step.)
