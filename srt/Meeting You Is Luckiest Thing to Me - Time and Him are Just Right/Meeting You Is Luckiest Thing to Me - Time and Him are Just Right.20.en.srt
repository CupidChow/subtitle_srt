17
00:01:41,978 --> 00:01:42,738
Lin Xi,

18
00:01:44,058 --> 00:01:45,298
will you be my girlfriend?

19
00:01:50,378 --> 00:01:51,618
Is this too sudden?

20
00:01:54,778 --> 00:01:56,058
A little.

21
00:01:57,178 --> 00:01:58,538
It's not to me.

22
00:02:00,098 --> 00:02:01,338
I've been waiting for you
for a long time.

23
00:02:04,698 --> 00:02:05,538
So

24
00:02:07,378 --> 00:02:08,538
what's your answer?

25
00:02:11,018 --> 00:02:12,578
A, B, C, and D.

26
00:02:13,458 --> 00:02:14,178
Choose one.

27
00:02:14,618 --> 00:02:15,818
You want me to bet on my luck

28
00:02:16,538 --> 00:02:17,858
for such a serious matter?

29
00:02:18,098 --> 00:02:18,698
Yes.

30
00:02:19,098 --> 00:02:19,698
Take a gamble.

31
00:02:21,858 --> 00:02:23,178
When in doubt,

32
00:02:24,338 --> 00:02:25,058
choose C.

33
00:02:25,458 --> 00:02:26,178
Congratulations.

34
00:02:26,618 --> 00:02:27,258
You got it right.

35
00:02:28,578 --> 00:02:30,058
Really? Am I that lucky?

36
00:02:30,498 --> 00:02:31,418
I only had a 25% chance,

37
00:02:31,418 --> 00:02:32,378
and I actually got it right.

38
00:02:32,778 --> 00:02:34,218
Your chances were 100%.

39
00:02:35,058 --> 00:02:36,778
No matter which one you chose,

40
00:02:37,218 --> 00:02:38,138
my answer was always going to be yes.

41
00:03:10,218 --> 00:03:11,178
I have something

42
00:03:11,658 --> 00:03:12,378
for you.

43
00:03:13,338 --> 00:03:14,138
What is it?

44
00:03:17,738 --> 00:03:19,098
Why do you have this?

45
00:03:19,098 --> 00:03:20,378
I thought I had lost it.

46
00:03:20,618 --> 00:03:22,178
I gave you this lucky charm.

47
00:03:22,178 --> 00:03:23,458
Don't lose it again.

48
00:03:23,698 --> 00:03:24,258
Don't worry.

49
00:03:24,258 --> 00:03:25,458
I won't lose it even if I lose myself.

50
00:03:53,898 --> 00:03:54,698
Sorry

51
00:03:54,698 --> 00:03:55,458
for keeping you waiting.

52
00:03:55,698 --> 00:03:57,218
Perfect.
We'll get lunch instead of breakfast.

53
00:03:57,218 --> 00:03:57,578
Let's go.

54
00:03:59,538 --> 00:04:00,778
Don't you think

55
00:04:01,098 --> 00:04:02,978
there's something different
about me today?

56
00:04:04,938 --> 00:04:05,818
No.

57
00:04:06,218 --> 00:04:07,538
You didn't even get a good look at me.

58
00:04:15,578 --> 00:04:16,738
Your lashes are long,

59
00:04:18,018 --> 00:04:19,338
your eyes are big,

60
00:04:23,258 --> 00:04:24,138
and you smell

61
00:04:24,738 --> 00:04:25,498
nice.

62
00:04:31,658 --> 00:04:33,018
Your earring looks unique.

63
00:04:35,058 --> 00:04:35,578
Really?

64
00:04:35,818 --> 00:04:37,178
I think so too.

65
00:04:38,778 --> 00:04:40,298
If you wear this on your nose,

66
00:04:40,458 --> 00:04:41,538
you'll be the Bull Demon King.

67
00:04:43,218 --> 00:04:44,178
If I were the Bull Demon King,

68
00:04:44,178 --> 00:04:45,178
you'd be the first person I slay.

69
00:04:45,698 --> 00:04:46,978
Well, you can only do that
on a full stomach.

70
00:04:47,378 --> 00:04:47,898
Come on.

71
00:04:53,778 --> 00:04:54,778
Aren't you afraid at all?

72
00:04:54,778 --> 00:04:55,618
Why should I be?

73
00:04:56,418 --> 00:04:57,258
Those stacks of photos from abroad

74
00:04:57,258 --> 00:04:58,338
are so thick,

75
00:04:58,338 --> 00:04:59,258
but I've gone through all of them.

76
00:04:59,578 --> 00:05:01,058
Hello, Junxing.

77
00:05:01,378 --> 00:05:02,418
Remember to attend the club activities

78
00:05:02,418 --> 00:05:03,538
in the afternoon.

79
00:05:04,618 --> 00:05:05,218
Junxing,

80
00:05:05,538 --> 00:05:06,138
who is she?

81
00:05:07,298 --> 00:05:08,098
My girlfriend.

82
00:05:08,378 --> 00:05:08,978
From medical school.

83
00:05:10,058 --> 00:05:11,418
- Hello, "sister-in-law".
- Hello, "sister-in-law".

84
00:05:12,538 --> 00:05:13,218
Hello.

85
00:05:14,098 --> 00:05:14,458
All right.

86
00:05:14,458 --> 00:05:15,098
You guys run along now.

87
00:05:15,098 --> 00:05:15,698
We're going up.

88
00:05:16,298 --> 00:05:16,698
Okay.

89
00:05:16,938 --> 00:05:18,578
Goodbye, "sister-in-law".

90
00:05:18,578 --> 00:05:18,858
Bye.

91
00:05:18,858 --> 00:05:19,538
Goodbye.

92
00:05:20,218 --> 00:05:20,858
Bye.

93
00:05:25,818 --> 00:05:26,178
Oh, right.

94
00:05:26,338 --> 00:05:27,818
I need a model for my class next week.

95
00:05:27,818 --> 00:05:28,458
Can you come?

96
00:05:28,778 --> 00:05:29,458
I was traumatized

97
00:05:29,458 --> 00:05:31,058
after the last time.

98
00:05:31,058 --> 00:05:31,818
Don't worry.

99
00:05:31,818 --> 00:05:32,858
You won't need
to take off your clothes this time.

100
00:05:33,378 --> 00:05:34,618
What's the fun, then?

101
00:05:36,298 --> 00:05:36,818
I can't believe

102
00:05:36,818 --> 00:05:38,018
my boyfriend is an exhibitionist.

103
00:05:38,018 --> 00:05:38,898
What's going on in your head?

104
00:05:38,898 --> 00:05:39,978
What's going on in yours?

105
00:05:40,538 --> 00:05:41,818
So are you going to help me or not?

106
00:05:41,818 --> 00:05:42,578
I will.

107
00:05:42,578 --> 00:05:44,098
There's no way I wouldn't help you.

108
00:05:44,098 --> 00:05:44,978
It's a promise, then.

109
00:05:48,898 --> 00:05:50,298
Why do you need to wrap my entire head?

110
00:05:51,938 --> 00:05:54,058
This is a simple bandage
in case of outdoor injuries.

111
00:05:55,658 --> 00:05:58,378
But it does look
a little ugly and silly.

112
00:05:59,018 --> 00:06:00,098
Like a potato.

113
00:06:00,378 --> 00:06:01,738
I don't know if it looks ugly,

114
00:06:02,098 --> 00:06:03,178
but it does feel stuffy.

115
00:06:04,058 --> 00:06:05,538
I forgot to make a hole
for you to breathe.

116
00:06:06,418 --> 00:06:07,018
Be careful.

117
00:06:07,018 --> 00:06:08,178
Don't cut my nose off.

118
00:06:08,458 --> 00:06:09,378
Don't move.

119
00:06:15,818 --> 00:06:16,738
What are you giggling about?

120
00:06:18,698 --> 00:06:20,178
A potato with nostrils.

121
00:06:40,658 --> 00:06:42,298
You have such nice arms.

122
00:06:42,978 --> 00:06:44,818
Distinct, toned bones.

123
00:06:45,338 --> 00:06:46,658
Fair skin.

124
00:06:50,218 --> 00:06:50,778
What are you doing?

125
00:06:51,018 --> 00:06:52,338
It must be really easy
to find your blood vessel

126
00:06:52,938 --> 00:06:54,298
if I need to perform an injection.

127
00:06:55,698 --> 00:06:56,738
You're the family member
of a medical student.

128
00:06:56,738 --> 00:06:57,938
It won't hurt you
to let me take a look at your arm.

129
00:06:58,098 --> 00:06:59,538
You're too devoted.

130
00:07:06,898 --> 00:07:07,898
Don't even think about it.

131
00:07:13,898 --> 00:07:15,138
When performing CPR,

132
00:07:15,138 --> 00:07:16,978
apply vertical compressions at the line

133
00:07:16,978 --> 00:07:17,938
between the two nipples.

134
00:07:21,818 --> 00:07:22,618
Are you all right?

135
00:07:22,898 --> 00:07:23,658
No.

136
00:07:24,058 --> 00:07:25,738
Can't we skip to the next part

137
00:07:25,738 --> 00:07:26,858
where you perform mouth-to-mouth on me?

138
00:07:27,138 --> 00:07:27,978
Be serious,

139
00:07:27,978 --> 00:07:29,298
as the family member
of a medical student.

140
00:07:29,938 --> 00:07:30,818
Go easy on me.

141
00:07:31,298 --> 00:07:32,138
I don't want to die

142
00:07:32,138 --> 00:07:32,898
before you graduate.

143
00:07:43,503 --> 00:07:45,301
(BBQ & BEER)

144
00:07:49,298 --> 00:07:51,018
What are everyone's plans
for the new year holidays?

145
00:07:51,298 --> 00:07:52,138
Gao Yunlang is spending it

146
00:07:52,138 --> 00:07:53,338
with his girlfriend, of course.

147
00:07:54,698 --> 00:07:55,218
What about you,

148
00:07:55,458 --> 00:07:56,058
Chen Mo?

149
00:07:56,578 --> 00:07:57,218
Me?

150
00:07:57,898 --> 00:07:59,418
There's an exhibition going on
at the planetarium.

151
00:07:59,418 --> 00:08:00,218
I want to check it out.

152
00:08:00,538 --> 00:08:01,218
So sophisticated.

153
00:08:01,498 --> 00:08:02,858
An uncultured guy like me

154
00:08:02,858 --> 00:08:04,018
only knows how to eat and sleep.

155
00:08:04,978 --> 00:08:05,498
Mianmian,

156
00:08:05,738 --> 00:08:07,098
you're planning
to go out too, aren't you?

157
00:08:07,098 --> 00:08:08,018
Where are you going?

158
00:08:08,018 --> 00:08:08,938
I don't know.

159
00:08:09,258 --> 00:08:10,698
Anywhere

160
00:08:11,258 --> 00:08:12,218
without Xie Ang.

161
00:08:15,178 --> 00:08:16,858
He is going to Mohe
to see the aurora borealis.

162
00:08:17,218 --> 00:08:18,738
Then,
I'll go to Hainan to pluck coconuts.

163
00:08:18,738 --> 00:08:19,138
Lin Xi,

164
00:08:19,138 --> 00:08:19,778
want to go together?

165
00:08:20,098 --> 00:08:20,858
I...

166
00:08:26,978 --> 00:08:27,578
Sorry.

167
00:08:27,578 --> 00:08:29,378
I have a report to write.

168
00:08:29,738 --> 00:08:30,218
Yes.

169
00:08:30,538 --> 00:08:31,418
We decided we would go

170
00:08:31,418 --> 00:08:32,178
to the library together.

171
00:08:32,538 --> 00:08:34,378
A studious couple
is indeed something else.

172
00:08:34,618 --> 00:08:36,058
Having a date in the library.

173
00:08:47,578 --> 00:08:49,458
Are you actually going to take me

174
00:08:49,458 --> 00:08:50,098
to the library?

175
00:08:51,458 --> 00:08:52,338
What's wrong with the library?

176
00:08:52,778 --> 00:08:54,538
The library is the temple
of human wisdom.

177
00:08:54,938 --> 00:08:56,138
It's the ladder of self-improvement.

178
00:08:56,698 --> 00:08:57,418
Oh.

179
00:08:59,618 --> 00:09:00,418
But...

180
00:09:01,658 --> 00:09:03,458
It's better to travel ten thousand miles
than to read ten thousand books.

181
00:09:03,658 --> 00:09:04,818
Broadly speaking,

182
00:09:05,098 --> 00:09:06,938
a trip is a book too.

183
00:09:07,178 --> 00:09:08,658
Does this mean
you're taking me on a trip?

184
00:09:08,658 --> 00:09:09,098
That's right.

185
00:09:09,338 --> 00:09:10,858
Why didn't you say so earlier?

186
00:09:10,858 --> 00:09:12,418
I want to take you somewhere.

187
00:09:12,738 --> 00:09:14,738
A place where it's just the two of us.

188
00:09:14,738 --> 00:09:15,538
Where?

189
00:09:15,938 --> 00:09:16,738
I'm not telling you.

190
00:09:17,618 --> 00:09:18,858
Are we taking the plane or the train?

191
00:09:18,858 --> 00:09:19,818
Neither.

192
00:09:21,498 --> 00:09:22,458
So mysterious.

193
00:09:23,338 --> 00:09:25,218
Think of it as a travel mystery box.

194
00:09:25,978 --> 00:09:27,018
Just follow me.

195
00:09:33,938 --> 00:09:34,818
I'm here.

196
00:09:34,818 --> 00:09:35,898
Where are you?

197
00:09:36,298 --> 00:09:37,298
In front of you.

198
00:09:39,058 --> 00:09:40,378
I don't see you.

199
00:09:49,258 --> 00:09:50,378
It is you!

200
00:09:51,058 --> 00:09:52,018
If I had known
that you would come in an RV,

201
00:09:52,018 --> 00:09:53,178
I would've brought more stuff.

202
00:09:53,378 --> 00:09:55,578
Snacks, coffee,
sunscreen, insect repellent,

203
00:09:55,578 --> 00:09:57,258
sofa bed, barbecue grill, and projector.

204
00:09:57,258 --> 00:09:58,058
I have all of those in the RV.

205
00:09:58,258 --> 00:09:59,058
What else do you need?

206
00:09:59,058 --> 00:10:01,978
I guess
I'll just bring my boyfriend, then.

207
00:10:02,498 --> 00:10:03,018
Hold on.

208
00:10:03,218 --> 00:10:04,178
Did you get your driving license?

209
00:10:04,178 --> 00:10:05,098
Can you drive?

210
00:10:07,018 --> 00:10:08,458
I got it one and a half years ago.

211
00:10:10,938 --> 00:10:12,538
So soon?

212
00:10:12,578 --> 00:10:14,138
Why did you retake
the driving lessons, then?

213
00:10:14,258 --> 00:10:15,658
I wasn't there to learn how to drive.

214
00:10:15,778 --> 00:10:16,898
I was there to protect you.

215
00:10:17,218 --> 00:10:18,138
There are lots of scammers
at the driving academy.

216
00:10:18,458 --> 00:10:19,738
And I don't trust Shen Pengyu,

217
00:10:19,738 --> 00:10:20,418
either.

218
00:10:20,418 --> 00:10:21,618
You dummy!

219
00:10:21,618 --> 00:10:22,698
You wasted all that money!

220
00:10:22,938 --> 00:10:24,298
That's what you're bothered about?

221
00:10:24,658 --> 00:10:25,898
Shouldn't you be feeling glad

222
00:10:26,218 --> 00:10:27,138
that I did all of this for you?

223
00:10:28,458 --> 00:10:29,458
Okay. Let's do this again.

224
00:10:30,818 --> 00:10:31,618
I must've saved

225
00:10:31,618 --> 00:10:33,058
the galaxy in my previous life.

226
00:10:33,058 --> 00:10:33,698
Otherwise,

227
00:10:33,698 --> 00:10:34,938
how would I manage
to land such an amazing boyfriend?

228
00:10:34,938 --> 00:10:35,618
Isn't that right?

229
00:10:36,498 --> 00:10:37,378
Happy now?

230
00:10:37,578 --> 00:10:38,178
Hug!

231
00:10:39,338 --> 00:10:40,738
- Yes!
- Yes!

232
00:10:40,738 --> 00:10:41,698
Lin Xi!

233
00:10:44,938 --> 00:10:45,818
Why are you guys here?

234
00:10:45,818 --> 00:10:47,058
We followed the scent.

235
00:10:48,218 --> 00:10:49,978
The smell of romance.

236
00:10:50,898 --> 00:10:51,658
Be quiet.

237
00:10:52,378 --> 00:10:54,378
Didn't you go to Hainan
to pick coconuts?

238
00:10:55,138 --> 00:10:56,498
The coconuts were too small.

239
00:10:56,498 --> 00:10:57,338
I couldn't pick them.

240
00:10:57,978 --> 00:10:58,658
What about you?

241
00:10:58,658 --> 00:11:00,418
Weren't you supposed to be in Mohe
to see the aurora borealis?

242
00:11:00,418 --> 00:11:01,618
Well, as pretty as they can be,

243
00:11:01,618 --> 00:11:02,858
it can't beat spending time

244
00:11:02,858 --> 00:11:04,098
with my best friends.

245
00:11:04,658 --> 00:11:05,498
Speak human.

246
00:11:05,898 --> 00:11:07,418
Well, the truth is, Jiang Yimian told me

247
00:11:07,418 --> 00:11:08,698
I could join a free RV trip,

248
00:11:08,698 --> 00:11:09,578
and that's why all of us are here.

249
00:11:10,298 --> 00:11:11,418
I didn't say that.

250
00:11:11,418 --> 00:11:12,298
Chen Mo told me about it.

251
00:11:12,858 --> 00:11:14,018
I heard it from Gao Yunlang.

252
00:11:14,018 --> 00:11:15,378
Yueyue told me to do this.

253
00:11:16,898 --> 00:11:17,978
Yueyue?

254
00:11:17,978 --> 00:11:18,698
That's right. It's me.

255
00:11:19,098 --> 00:11:20,458
It's such a coincidence.

256
00:11:20,458 --> 00:11:21,098
The Department of Psychology

257
00:11:21,098 --> 00:11:21,938
happened to be doing

258
00:11:21,938 --> 00:11:23,218
a social practice survey

259
00:11:23,218 --> 00:11:25,578
about testing the tacit understanding
of traveling couples.

260
00:11:25,578 --> 00:11:27,618
I happened to catch
Ji Junxing renting an RV,

261
00:11:27,618 --> 00:11:29,058
and we happened
to have three couples in our group.

262
00:11:29,378 --> 00:11:30,698
Xie Ang and I are not a couple.

263
00:11:31,618 --> 00:11:32,658
Fine. 2.5 couples then.

264
00:11:32,938 --> 00:11:34,098
Either way,

265
00:11:34,098 --> 00:11:35,418
all of you are my samples.

266
00:11:36,658 --> 00:11:38,298
I guess it is a coincidence.

267
00:11:38,818 --> 00:11:39,658
Don't worry.

268
00:11:39,658 --> 00:11:40,938
You guys
won't be doing this for nothing.

269
00:11:41,258 --> 00:11:42,618
The couple
with the best tacit understanding

270
00:11:42,618 --> 00:11:43,978
will receive a mystery prize.

271
00:11:44,458 --> 00:11:45,378
What mystery prize?

272
00:11:45,378 --> 00:11:46,178
Elaborate.

273
00:11:46,178 --> 00:11:47,338
You'll find out when it's time.

274
00:11:48,098 --> 00:11:48,498
All right.

275
00:11:48,778 --> 00:11:49,858
Since everyone is here,

276
00:11:49,858 --> 00:11:50,818
I hereby announce

277
00:11:50,818 --> 00:11:52,778
the East Gate Squad and Family
Team-Building Trip

278
00:11:52,778 --> 00:11:53,738
starts now!

279
00:11:53,738 --> 00:11:54,578
Let's go!

280
00:12:09,218 --> 00:12:11,418
♪Let us be lovers on this earth♪

281
00:12:11,418 --> 00:12:13,498
♪And live a carefree life♪

282
00:12:14,018 --> 00:12:17,618
♪Riding horses and sharing prosperity♪

283
00:12:17,898 --> 00:12:21,818
♪Drink and sing to our hearts' content♪

284
00:12:21,818 --> 00:12:27,898
♪Seize the prime of our youth♪

285
00:12:30,738 --> 00:12:32,138
Let's eat!

286
00:12:33,618 --> 00:12:34,898
Is there a way

287
00:12:34,898 --> 00:12:36,698
to get rid of these people?

288
00:12:37,858 --> 00:12:38,938
They won't go away.

289
00:12:42,378 --> 00:12:43,418
But we can make ourselves disappear.

290
00:12:44,178 --> 00:12:44,898
What are you thinking about?

291
00:12:45,338 --> 00:12:46,258
When we get there,

292
00:12:46,818 --> 00:12:48,978
we'll find a way
to get away from the group.

293
00:12:49,898 --> 00:12:50,778
Will that work?

294
00:12:50,818 --> 00:12:51,738
It can't hurt to try.

295
00:12:55,178 --> 00:12:55,818
Here you go.

296
00:12:55,818 --> 00:12:56,978
Want some?

297
00:12:57,618 --> 00:12:58,698
Give me some too.

298
00:13:16,338 --> 00:13:17,018
Wow!

299
00:13:17,818 --> 00:13:19,138
So this is the cultural mountain town

300
00:13:19,138 --> 00:13:20,698
that is transformed
from a deserted village.

301
00:13:23,178 --> 00:13:24,098
Be careful, everyone.

302
00:13:24,218 --> 00:13:25,298
The insects here
are especially poisonous.

303
00:13:25,298 --> 00:13:26,138
Perfect.

304
00:13:26,178 --> 00:13:27,258
With someone who is an insect magnet

305
00:13:27,258 --> 00:13:27,938
like you,

306
00:13:27,938 --> 00:13:28,978
we don't need to bring insect repellent.

307
00:13:29,098 --> 00:13:30,258
As if I would walk with you.

308
00:13:32,258 --> 00:13:34,458
It's more exciting to move
in smaller groups in a place like this.

309
00:13:34,858 --> 00:13:36,098
Why don't we split up?

310
00:13:36,698 --> 00:13:37,178
Right.

311
00:13:37,178 --> 00:13:38,898
There's a path over there

312
00:13:38,898 --> 00:13:39,938
and another over here.

313
00:13:39,938 --> 00:13:41,458
Maybe we should split up and move.

314
00:13:41,458 --> 00:13:42,218
I agree.

315
00:13:42,578 --> 00:13:43,298
Gao Yunlang,

316
00:13:43,298 --> 00:13:44,098
let's move together.

317
00:13:44,338 --> 00:13:45,298
Come along, Chen Mo.

318
00:13:48,898 --> 00:13:49,458
Then...

319
00:13:49,458 --> 00:13:50,018
Lin Xi,

320
00:13:50,298 --> 00:13:51,218
let's team up.

321
00:13:51,538 --> 00:13:52,178
It's a waste of life

322
00:13:52,178 --> 00:13:53,778
traveling with someone

323
00:13:53,778 --> 00:13:54,978
who hasn't got a romantic bone.

324
00:13:55,298 --> 00:13:55,858
Let's go.

325
00:13:57,098 --> 00:13:58,378
Who would want to team up with you?

326
00:13:58,858 --> 00:13:59,458
Come on, Xing.

327
00:14:14,498 --> 00:14:16,338
This place really
has been cast away by the world.

328
00:14:17,978 --> 00:14:18,818
Lin Xi,

329
00:14:19,258 --> 00:14:20,658
what do you think about this guy?

330
00:14:22,418 --> 00:14:23,618
He looks familiar.

331
00:14:24,418 --> 00:14:24,978
Isn't he the one

332
00:14:24,978 --> 00:14:26,018
who chatted you up
during the speed dating?

333
00:14:26,018 --> 00:14:26,498
Yes.

334
00:14:26,818 --> 00:14:28,058
His name is He Qingyuan.

335
00:14:28,378 --> 00:14:29,738
He has a mild personality.

336
00:14:29,738 --> 00:14:31,098
He has been chatting with me lately.

337
00:14:31,338 --> 00:14:33,458
I think it's time for me

338
00:14:33,458 --> 00:14:34,258
to start a new chapter.

339
00:14:34,978 --> 00:14:36,818
What about Xie Ang?

340
00:14:37,578 --> 00:14:39,458
He is all in the past now.

341
00:14:39,458 --> 00:14:41,178
Help me notify him.

342
00:14:41,178 --> 00:14:42,898
Tell him not to approach me,

343
00:14:42,898 --> 00:14:43,698
not to talk to me,

344
00:14:43,698 --> 00:14:44,898
and not to buy me gifts.

345
00:14:44,898 --> 00:14:46,338
Don't send me money through Alipay too.

346
00:14:46,818 --> 00:14:48,258
Got it.

347
00:14:48,618 --> 00:14:49,898
So you're still hung up on him.

348
00:14:50,818 --> 00:14:52,338
No way!

349
00:14:52,338 --> 00:14:53,218
He is dead to me.

350
00:14:59,058 --> 00:15:00,178
Thank goodness we broke up.

351
00:15:00,498 --> 00:15:01,378
If I had to describe my life

352
00:15:01,378 --> 00:15:02,538
with a word right now,

353
00:15:02,538 --> 00:15:03,258
it's happiness.

354
00:15:03,258 --> 00:15:04,298
If I had to use a different phrasing,

355
00:15:04,538 --> 00:15:05,498
then I've shed off a wretched plight.

356
00:15:06,298 --> 00:15:08,138
Well, to prevent yourself
from going back,

357
00:15:08,698 --> 00:15:09,818
you should delete her WeChat contact.

358
00:15:10,218 --> 00:15:11,138
You're right.

359
00:15:11,138 --> 00:15:12,098
You've reminded me.

360
00:15:12,538 --> 00:15:13,338
I'll delete it right now.

361
00:15:13,338 --> 00:15:14,658
I won't add her again,
even if she begs me.

362
00:15:15,778 --> 00:15:17,698
Jiang Yimian, WeChat.

363
00:15:17,698 --> 00:15:18,658
Delete.

364
00:15:20,058 --> 00:15:23,178
You should delete
her contact, texts, phone number, QQ,

365
00:15:23,178 --> 00:15:23,978
and Weibo too.

366
00:15:25,338 --> 00:15:27,058
QQ deleted.

367
00:15:28,178 --> 00:15:28,738
Weibo

368
00:15:30,298 --> 00:15:31,178
unfollowed.

369
00:15:32,018 --> 00:15:33,338
Blocked her number.

370
00:15:34,698 --> 00:15:35,498
What about Alipay?

371
00:15:35,978 --> 00:15:36,578
Delete that too.

372
00:15:37,418 --> 00:15:38,498
I can't do that.

373
00:15:39,298 --> 00:15:40,818
What if we still have properties

374
00:15:40,818 --> 00:15:41,938
that we haven't divided yet?

375
00:15:42,178 --> 00:15:43,098
Can't bring yourself to do it?

376
00:15:43,498 --> 00:15:43,978
I'll help you.

377
00:15:43,978 --> 00:15:44,698
No need.

378
00:15:45,778 --> 00:15:47,018
The view is nice from there.

379
00:15:47,018 --> 00:15:48,098
I'll go take some pictures.

380
00:16:05,738 --> 00:16:06,778
(How are things on your end?)

381
00:16:12,418 --> 00:16:14,098
(Roasts and complaints
session underway.)

382
00:16:14,178 --> 00:16:14,778
(What about you?)

383
00:16:17,658 --> 00:16:19,178
(I've been listening to nonsense
all the way.)

384
00:16:19,178 --> 00:16:20,978
(He clearly still has feelings for her,)

385
00:16:20,978 --> 00:16:22,978
(but he is desperately
trying to prove that he doesn't.)

386
00:16:25,898 --> 00:16:28,098
(I guess we won't be able
to get them off our tails.)

387
00:16:28,098 --> 00:16:29,738
(Escape mission failed.)

388
00:16:34,858 --> 00:16:36,178
(I have another plan.)

389
00:16:51,898 --> 00:16:52,778
What?

390
00:16:52,778 --> 00:16:54,298
He fell down the mountain?

391
00:16:54,578 --> 00:16:55,538
What happened?

392
00:16:55,538 --> 00:16:56,338
Who fell?

393
00:16:56,338 --> 00:16:57,098
Xie Ang!

394
00:16:57,378 --> 00:16:58,578
Where's the top of the mountain?

395
00:16:58,578 --> 00:16:59,658
Over there!

396
00:17:11,898 --> 00:17:12,378
Hello?

397
00:17:13,378 --> 00:17:13,898
What?

398
00:17:14,178 --> 00:17:15,058
It can't be!

399
00:17:16,418 --> 00:17:17,338
I see on the map

400
00:17:17,338 --> 00:17:18,498
there's a house
on the top of the mountain.

401
00:17:18,778 --> 00:17:19,498
Wait there.

402
00:17:19,498 --> 00:17:20,538
I'll be right there.

403
00:17:21,218 --> 00:17:22,018
What happened?

404
00:17:23,178 --> 00:17:24,218
Jiang Yimian was bitten by a snake.

405
00:17:24,778 --> 00:17:25,698
Jiang Yimian?

406
00:17:26,258 --> 00:17:26,738
She was what?

407
00:17:26,738 --> 00:17:27,618
Bitten by a snake!

408
00:17:28,658 --> 00:17:29,618
Which way to the top?

409
00:17:29,618 --> 00:17:30,698
To your right.

410
00:17:34,578 --> 00:17:35,218
Where is he?

411
00:17:35,218 --> 00:17:36,538
Didn't she say
he's on the mountain top?

412
00:17:39,618 --> 00:17:42,978
Jiang Yimian!
Jiang Yimian! Jiang Yimian!

413
00:17:43,738 --> 00:17:44,538
Jiang Yimian!

414
00:17:45,938 --> 00:17:46,618
Jiang Yimian!

415
00:17:47,178 --> 00:17:48,058
Are you okay?

416
00:17:48,818 --> 00:17:49,418
Sit down!

417
00:17:49,618 --> 00:17:50,498
Where did it bite you?

418
00:17:50,498 --> 00:17:50,818
Does it hurt?

419
00:17:50,818 --> 00:17:51,538
Let me see the wound!

420
00:17:51,818 --> 00:17:52,738
What wound?

421
00:17:52,738 --> 00:17:54,058
Weren't you bitten by a snake?

422
00:17:55,218 --> 00:17:56,098
The five-step snake?

423
00:17:56,098 --> 00:17:56,778
How many steps have you taken?

424
00:17:57,058 --> 00:17:58,138
How many?

425
00:17:58,138 --> 00:17:59,858
What are you rambling about?

426
00:17:59,858 --> 00:18:00,538
What about you?

427
00:18:00,538 --> 00:18:01,698
Did you break your leg?

428
00:18:02,018 --> 00:18:02,738
The road is flat.

429
00:18:02,738 --> 00:18:04,018
How could you fall?

430
00:18:04,458 --> 00:18:05,738
I didn't break my leg.

431
00:18:06,058 --> 00:18:07,458
But I was in a hurry

432
00:18:07,458 --> 00:18:08,218
to see you,

433
00:18:08,218 --> 00:18:09,658
and I think I pulled a muscle.

434
00:18:10,538 --> 00:18:11,618
Hurry and sit down, then!

435
00:18:13,098 --> 00:18:14,618
Why did you run so fast?

436
00:18:14,618 --> 00:18:16,218
I was worried about you.

437
00:18:25,378 --> 00:18:26,858
I don't need your concern.

438
00:18:28,618 --> 00:18:29,818
Since you're fine now,

439
00:18:29,818 --> 00:18:30,338
I guess I'll leave.

440
00:18:30,578 --> 00:18:31,178
Sit down.

441
00:18:38,138 --> 00:18:39,258
Does your leg still hurt?

442
00:18:53,698 --> 00:18:54,578
No.

443
00:19:03,058 --> 00:19:04,178
Jiang Yimian smiled.

444
00:19:04,658 --> 00:19:06,138
This must mean they're back together.

445
00:19:06,618 --> 00:19:07,338
I saw that.

446
00:19:08,058 --> 00:19:09,578
It looks like they're all right now.

447
00:19:09,778 --> 00:19:11,298
Finally, no one will disturb us anymore.

448
00:19:11,458 --> 00:19:12,338
You're right.

449
00:19:45,138 --> 00:19:45,938
Don't stop.

450
00:19:46,258 --> 00:19:47,138
Continue.

451
00:19:49,498 --> 00:19:50,858
Thanks, guys...

452
00:19:51,578 --> 00:19:53,898
We didn't interrupt, did we?

453
00:19:54,698 --> 00:19:55,778
What do you think?

454
00:20:08,978 --> 00:20:09,778
Lin Xi,

455
00:20:10,258 --> 00:20:11,498
why were you and Ji Junxing

456
00:20:11,498 --> 00:20:12,898
behind the wall earlier?

457
00:20:13,458 --> 00:20:16,498
We were looking at the ants on the wall.

458
00:20:17,778 --> 00:20:18,938
I saw everything.

459
00:20:19,298 --> 00:20:21,178
Were you guys kissing?

460
00:20:21,178 --> 00:20:22,418
No.

461
00:20:22,418 --> 00:20:23,898
We just bumped heads.

462
00:20:23,898 --> 00:20:24,778
It was just an accident.

463
00:20:25,818 --> 00:20:27,258
Don't tell me
you guys haven't even kissed yet.

464
00:20:29,258 --> 00:20:31,018
We've only been together recently.

465
00:20:31,418 --> 00:20:32,538
We can't move that fast.

466
00:20:33,098 --> 00:20:34,738
I'll give you an idea.

467
00:20:35,138 --> 00:20:37,178
Have you guys heard
of the eight-second rule?

468
00:20:39,618 --> 00:20:41,418
When you're alone

469
00:20:41,418 --> 00:20:42,698
with the person you like,

470
00:20:42,698 --> 00:20:45,178
and you look into their eyes
for eight seconds,

471
00:20:45,178 --> 00:20:46,458
your pupils will contract,

472
00:20:46,458 --> 00:20:47,578
reducing your concept of time

473
00:20:47,578 --> 00:20:49,498
and stimulating adrenaline secretion.

474
00:20:49,738 --> 00:20:51,938
It's like eating chocolate

475
00:20:51,938 --> 00:20:52,978
while riding a roller coaster.

476
00:20:53,778 --> 00:20:55,418
In any case, it only takes eight seconds

477
00:20:55,418 --> 00:20:56,338
to generate the impulse to kiss.

478
00:20:57,058 --> 00:20:58,538
That sounds pretty reasonable.

479
00:20:59,458 --> 00:21:00,338
Lin Xi,

480
00:21:00,338 --> 00:21:01,418
want to give it a try?

481
00:21:02,418 --> 00:21:03,658
Do you guys think

482
00:21:03,658 --> 00:21:05,658
we can get another opportunity
to be alone today?

483
00:21:05,898 --> 00:21:08,178
Opportunities are created.

484
00:21:09,498 --> 00:21:11,018
When we split up into teams
to row the kayaks,

485
00:21:11,018 --> 00:21:11,778
Yueyue and I will get

486
00:21:11,778 --> 00:21:13,298
everyone else away

487
00:21:14,138 --> 00:21:15,578
and leave you guys alone.

488
00:21:16,018 --> 00:21:16,618
Don't worry.

489
00:21:16,858 --> 00:21:18,338
We'll make sure you guys

490
00:21:18,338 --> 00:21:19,258
get some personal time today.

491
00:21:20,298 --> 00:21:20,778
Come on.

492
00:21:28,338 --> 00:21:28,938
Slowly.

493
00:21:28,938 --> 00:21:29,898
Slow down.

494
00:21:30,418 --> 00:21:32,178
It's no fun just rowing kayaks.

495
00:21:32,498 --> 00:21:33,338
Why don't we have a competition?

496
00:21:33,338 --> 00:21:34,138
Sure!

497
00:21:34,138 --> 00:21:35,218
You're on!

498
00:21:35,578 --> 00:21:36,538
What are the stakes?

499
00:21:36,978 --> 00:21:38,378
Winners get to relax.

500
00:21:38,378 --> 00:21:40,178
Losers have to cook,

501
00:21:40,178 --> 00:21:40,858
serve,

502
00:21:40,858 --> 00:21:41,698
and take care of all the chores.

503
00:21:42,098 --> 00:21:43,218
That's a lot.

504
00:21:43,218 --> 00:21:44,298
I like it.

505
00:21:44,298 --> 00:21:44,898
With me here,

506
00:21:44,898 --> 00:21:45,858
you've got a ticket to an easy win.

507
00:21:46,138 --> 00:21:47,898
We'll leave it to you guys, then.

508
00:21:48,218 --> 00:21:48,738
Let's go!

509
00:21:48,738 --> 00:21:49,458
Come on!

510
00:21:49,458 --> 00:21:49,778
Let's go.

511
00:21:49,778 --> 00:21:50,498
All the best.

512
00:21:50,498 --> 00:21:50,858
Be careful.

513
00:21:50,858 --> 00:21:51,938
Don't lose.

514
00:21:52,898 --> 00:21:53,298
There are a lot of rocks.

515
00:21:53,298 --> 00:21:54,218
Take care.

516
00:21:55,138 --> 00:21:56,058
Get on the kayak first, Mianmian.

517
00:21:56,058 --> 00:21:56,658
Okay.

518
00:21:56,938 --> 00:21:58,218
Slowly now.

519
00:21:58,218 --> 00:21:58,978
Let's go.

520
00:21:59,258 --> 00:22:00,138
We should...

521
00:22:00,338 --> 00:22:01,098
There are a lot of rocks.

522
00:22:10,418 --> 00:22:11,178
Get ready!

523
00:22:11,498 --> 00:22:12,418
Let's go!

524
00:22:12,818 --> 00:22:13,978
- Let's go!
- Let's go!

525
00:22:17,258 --> 00:22:19,218
One, two.

526
00:22:19,218 --> 00:22:21,098
Go, go, go!

527
00:22:21,098 --> 00:22:22,178
One, two.

528
00:22:32,618 --> 00:22:34,098
It's good not to
aim for the first place.

529
00:22:34,298 --> 00:22:36,818
Now, I feel like I'm on vacation.

530
00:22:37,538 --> 00:22:38,938
With the speed we're going,

531
00:22:39,018 --> 00:22:40,018
you might actually need

532
00:22:40,058 --> 00:22:41,458
to make dinner.

533
00:22:42,938 --> 00:22:43,818
Me? Cook?

534
00:22:44,098 --> 00:22:45,778
Is it a punishment for them or for me?

535
00:22:46,698 --> 00:22:48,378
I'm starting
to feel bad for them already.

536
00:22:51,218 --> 00:22:51,778
Hang on.

537
00:22:52,818 --> 00:22:53,618
What's that on your neck?

538
00:22:55,018 --> 00:22:55,658
Let me see it.

539
00:22:59,698 --> 00:23:00,738
You've got a cut.

540
00:23:01,298 --> 00:23:02,538
Maybe I got it
from the deserted village.

541
00:23:02,658 --> 00:23:03,298
It's okay.

542
00:23:03,298 --> 00:23:04,178
It's not okay!

543
00:23:04,178 --> 00:23:05,018
It's bleeding!

544
00:23:05,298 --> 00:23:06,338
I'm fine.

545
00:23:10,738 --> 00:23:11,738
Don't move.

546
00:23:16,378 --> 00:23:17,018
Here.

547
00:23:22,578 --> 00:23:23,418
Does it hurt?

548
00:23:37,538 --> 00:23:38,658
We're going to crash!

549
00:23:41,978 --> 00:23:42,858
Are you all right?

550
00:23:45,018 --> 00:23:45,738
Help!

551
00:23:45,738 --> 00:23:46,418
Chen Mo!

552
00:23:46,418 --> 00:23:47,258
Save Yueyue!

553
00:23:47,258 --> 00:23:47,858
Hurry!

554
00:23:47,858 --> 00:23:48,938
Yueyue!

555
00:23:49,218 --> 00:23:50,218
Save Yueyue!

556
00:23:50,218 --> 00:23:51,058
Hurry!

557
00:23:52,218 --> 00:23:53,338
Gao Yunlang!

558
00:23:53,778 --> 00:23:55,658
Did we somehow win by accident?

559
00:23:56,618 --> 00:23:57,178
Yes.

560
00:23:58,418 --> 00:23:59,458
Dinner's on me.

561
00:23:59,458 --> 00:24:00,978
No need to do anything
or pay for anything.

562
00:24:10,858 --> 00:24:13,058
Dear winners,

563
00:24:13,058 --> 00:24:14,218
would you like beer, coffee,

564
00:24:14,218 --> 00:24:15,138
or coke?

565
00:24:16,818 --> 00:24:18,498
You don't have to serve us.

566
00:24:18,498 --> 00:24:19,578
Let's make it self-service.

567
00:24:20,138 --> 00:24:20,738
We didn't win properly.

568
00:24:20,738 --> 00:24:21,618
I feel bad about this.

569
00:24:22,458 --> 00:24:23,618
I'm the one that feels guilty.

570
00:24:23,898 --> 00:24:24,898
I didn't manage to help you.

571
00:24:24,898 --> 00:24:25,938
It's my fault.

572
00:24:26,378 --> 00:24:28,138
We'll take two cokes.

573
00:24:32,338 --> 00:24:33,698
What did she mean?

574
00:24:33,698 --> 00:24:34,658
Didn't manage to help?

575
00:24:35,338 --> 00:24:36,338
Do you need my help?

576
00:24:38,218 --> 00:24:39,538
There's always next time.

577
00:24:41,538 --> 00:24:42,818
What's all that about?

578
00:24:42,818 --> 00:24:43,818
Let's watch the movie.

579
00:24:56,538 --> 00:24:57,938
What took you so long to come out?

580
00:24:58,498 --> 00:24:59,658
His clothes were completely soaked.

581
00:24:59,658 --> 00:25:00,858
I had to get him new ones.

582
00:25:03,538 --> 00:25:04,378
You guys carry on.

583
00:25:04,378 --> 00:25:05,458
I'll go and help over there.

584
00:25:06,018 --> 00:25:06,578
Okay.

585
00:25:08,538 --> 00:25:10,618
Why are you so concerned about Chen Mo?

586
00:25:10,858 --> 00:25:12,218
He's my friend.

587
00:25:12,218 --> 00:25:13,618
And I'm your girlfriend.

588
00:25:13,818 --> 00:25:15,058
What's the matter with you?

589
00:25:15,418 --> 00:25:16,258
Can't you tell?

590
00:25:16,258 --> 00:25:17,698
I'm angry!

591
00:25:17,698 --> 00:25:18,858
I know that.

592
00:25:18,858 --> 00:25:20,778
But why are you angry?

593
00:25:21,218 --> 00:25:21,738
I...

594
00:25:23,538 --> 00:25:24,378
Figure it out yourself!

595
00:25:36,258 --> 00:25:37,058
What's wrong?

596
00:25:37,058 --> 00:25:37,858
You're grilling mushrooms

597
00:25:37,858 --> 00:25:38,938
and meat.

598
00:25:40,258 --> 00:25:41,138
I can do what I want.

599
00:25:42,218 --> 00:25:43,298
Did you get into a fight
with Gao Yunlang?

600
00:25:43,778 --> 00:25:44,818
Yes.

601
00:25:45,218 --> 00:25:46,898
I want to roast him on the grill

602
00:25:46,898 --> 00:25:47,978
over a slow charcoal fire.

603
00:25:50,778 --> 00:25:52,258
Abandoned

604
00:25:52,658 --> 00:25:53,898
and ignored.

605
00:25:55,138 --> 00:25:55,738
I know how you feel.

606
00:25:58,338 --> 00:26:00,858
Why is it so hard

607
00:26:00,858 --> 00:26:01,818
to get someone's attention?

608
00:26:03,938 --> 00:26:05,098
Well, there are ways.

609
00:26:06,258 --> 00:26:06,978
How?

610
00:26:11,538 --> 00:26:12,818
Will that work?

611
00:26:13,738 --> 00:26:15,298
That depends on our acting skills.

612
00:26:24,618 --> 00:26:26,218
The moon is round tonight.

613
00:26:28,018 --> 00:26:29,458
Want to go for a walk?

614
00:26:31,818 --> 00:26:32,858
We had dinner

615
00:26:32,858 --> 00:26:33,898
and watched a movie.

616
00:26:34,898 --> 00:26:36,378
The day is almost over.

617
00:26:36,978 --> 00:26:38,418
Nothing else will happen, right?

618
00:26:46,858 --> 00:26:47,658
Xie Ang!

619
00:26:47,938 --> 00:26:48,498
Xie Ang!

620
00:26:49,098 --> 00:26:49,738
What's wrong?

621
00:26:50,418 --> 00:26:51,378
Are you all right?

622
00:26:51,778 --> 00:26:52,418
Mushroom.

623
00:26:52,938 --> 00:26:53,698
What's wrong with the mushrooms?

624
00:26:53,698 --> 00:26:54,658
Don't eat them.

625
00:26:54,658 --> 00:26:55,178
They're poisonous.

626
00:26:55,178 --> 00:26:55,658
You spoke too soon.

627
00:26:55,658 --> 00:26:56,618
Don't eat the mushrooms.

628
00:26:57,978 --> 00:26:58,818
Get up.

629
00:26:59,138 --> 00:27:00,058
Lin Xi.

630
00:27:01,098 --> 00:27:02,538
What's the matter, Xie Ang?

631
00:27:02,538 --> 00:27:03,618
Are you okay?

632
00:27:03,618 --> 00:27:04,378
Open your eyes.

633
00:27:09,538 --> 00:27:10,378
Open your eyes.

634
00:27:11,138 --> 00:27:11,938
Open your mouth.

635
00:27:14,618 --> 00:27:16,538
Nothing seems to be wrong.

636
00:27:17,378 --> 00:27:18,858
Do you guys have any other symptoms?

637
00:27:19,938 --> 00:27:21,418
My head is spinning,
and I feel nauseous.

638
00:27:21,418 --> 00:27:22,938
I feel like throwing up too.

639
00:27:24,378 --> 00:27:25,458
I'm seeing people everywhere.

640
00:27:25,458 --> 00:27:25,858
Yes.

641
00:27:26,138 --> 00:27:27,498
There's one here

642
00:27:27,858 --> 00:27:29,418
and another one over there.

643
00:27:29,698 --> 00:27:30,458
Lin Xi,

644
00:27:30,898 --> 00:27:32,458
there's one on your head too.

645
00:27:37,938 --> 00:27:39,978
Oh, it is serious.

646
00:27:39,978 --> 00:27:41,338
Should we take them to the hospital?

647
00:27:41,338 --> 00:27:41,938
No need.

648
00:27:42,178 --> 00:27:43,698
They just need some rest

649
00:27:43,978 --> 00:27:45,818
and some gentle care

650
00:27:46,098 --> 00:27:47,058
from the people looking after them.

651
00:27:47,538 --> 00:27:48,418
Gentle care?

652
00:27:48,698 --> 00:27:49,738
That's a treatment too?

653
00:27:50,858 --> 00:27:53,258
It's just like
how you can't wake up a dream walker.

654
00:27:53,578 --> 00:27:54,778
They're in an illusion right now.

655
00:27:55,378 --> 00:27:56,618
They're sensitive.

656
00:27:56,938 --> 00:27:58,058
They can't be agitated.

657
00:27:58,298 --> 00:27:59,578
Right, Dr. Lin?

658
00:28:01,178 --> 00:28:01,898
That makes sense.

659
00:28:02,658 --> 00:28:03,618
Poor things.

660
00:28:04,778 --> 00:28:05,618
Don't worry.

661
00:28:05,618 --> 00:28:06,978
I'll take good care of you.

662
00:28:06,978 --> 00:28:08,218
Mianmian, you're so nice.

663
00:28:09,498 --> 00:28:10,298
I want some water.

664
00:28:11,298 --> 00:28:11,898
Mianmian, you look after him.

665
00:28:11,898 --> 00:28:12,738
I'll get the water.

666
00:28:12,738 --> 00:28:13,098
Okay.

667
00:28:16,738 --> 00:28:18,018
Do you want some water?
I can get some for you.

668
00:28:18,258 --> 00:28:19,058
Don't go.

669
00:28:19,058 --> 00:28:19,898
I feel awful.

670
00:28:19,898 --> 00:28:21,698
I want you to stay with me.

671
00:28:24,978 --> 00:28:26,098
I feel terrible.

672
00:28:27,138 --> 00:28:28,178
My head hurts.

673
00:28:30,898 --> 00:28:33,538
The day was almost over,

674
00:28:33,898 --> 00:28:35,018
and that still happened.

675
00:28:36,138 --> 00:28:38,058
Finally, some peace and quietness.

676
00:28:42,138 --> 00:28:43,618
Do you think I might be poisoned too?

677
00:28:45,618 --> 00:28:47,538
That moon looks so big to me.

678
00:28:51,858 --> 00:28:52,818
Me too.

679
00:28:53,618 --> 00:28:55,458
When I look at the stars,

680
00:28:55,458 --> 00:28:57,458
all of them have long tails,

681
00:28:57,458 --> 00:28:58,698
just like jellyfish.

682
00:28:59,698 --> 00:29:00,458
You're right.

683
00:29:01,578 --> 00:29:02,898
Can you hear the waves?

684
00:29:09,378 --> 00:29:11,258
Do you think

685
00:29:11,258 --> 00:29:12,898
we're in the sea?

686
00:29:13,898 --> 00:29:14,618
Yes.

687
00:29:15,098 --> 00:29:16,218
Look underneath our feet.

688
00:29:16,978 --> 00:29:18,538
It's filled with corals

689
00:29:18,538 --> 00:29:19,978
and sardines.

690
00:29:20,698 --> 00:29:22,378
What sardines?

691
00:29:23,738 --> 00:29:24,458
Look.

692
00:29:25,098 --> 00:29:26,898
They're everywhere around us.

693
00:29:28,258 --> 00:29:29,058
It's a huge school of sardines.

694
00:29:33,418 --> 00:29:36,178
I feel like I'm in the clouds right now.

695
00:29:37,738 --> 00:29:38,898
It's so soft and fluffy.

696
00:29:39,178 --> 00:29:40,218
It makes me sleepy.

697
00:29:42,178 --> 00:29:42,978
Then,

698
00:29:43,538 --> 00:29:44,858
let's sleep among the skies.

699
00:29:48,858 --> 00:29:49,538
Ji Junxing,

700
00:29:50,698 --> 00:29:52,058
I'm really happy

701
00:29:52,698 --> 00:29:53,618
I got to come on this trip with you.

702
00:29:54,858 --> 00:29:56,378
Let's go to more places together, then.

703
00:32:15,618 --> 00:32:16,698
What am I doing?

704
00:32:56,298 --> 00:32:57,218
I can't go back to sleep.

705
00:32:59,738 --> 00:33:01,098
Well, it's almost morning.

706
00:33:21,618 --> 00:33:22,298
Lin Xi.

707
00:33:28,818 --> 00:33:29,378
You...

708
00:33:30,018 --> 00:33:31,298
Why are you up so early?

709
00:33:33,258 --> 00:33:34,818
I couldn't sleep because of the bugs.

710
00:33:37,858 --> 00:33:38,738
That's not what I meant.

711
00:33:38,738 --> 00:33:39,458
I was talking about the real ones.

712
00:33:39,458 --> 00:33:40,138
The ones that suck blood.

713
00:33:40,138 --> 00:33:41,018
Not you.

714
00:33:42,098 --> 00:33:43,818
I'll get you the insect repellent.

715
00:33:58,818 --> 00:33:59,458
Lin Xi?

716
00:34:01,018 --> 00:34:01,938
Lin Xi!

717
00:34:05,338 --> 00:34:06,138
Lin Xi.

718
00:34:06,138 --> 00:34:07,098
I'm here!

719
00:34:09,178 --> 00:34:10,618
Why did you go over there?

720
00:34:14,418 --> 00:34:15,738
Why did you go over there?

721
00:34:15,738 --> 00:34:17,018
I'm waiting for the sunrise.

722
00:34:18,098 --> 00:34:18,658
Look!

723
00:34:18,898 --> 00:34:20,018
The sun will rise

724
00:34:20,018 --> 00:34:20,858
from that forest.

725
00:34:23,698 --> 00:34:24,498
Did you know?

726
00:34:24,898 --> 00:34:26,538
When I was young, my mom told me

727
00:34:26,778 --> 00:34:29,018
that the sunrise was when the deities
lit the lanterns.

728
00:34:29,458 --> 00:34:31,658
So I always got up early every morning

729
00:34:31,978 --> 00:34:33,978
just to catch the deities
lighting up the lanterns.

730
00:34:35,298 --> 00:34:36,818
When I got older, I realized

731
00:34:37,298 --> 00:34:38,658
that it was all a lie she made up

732
00:34:38,658 --> 00:34:39,418
to get me to wake up early.

733
00:34:41,978 --> 00:34:43,378
But all those stories

734
00:34:43,778 --> 00:34:45,538
made my childhood more interesting.

735
00:34:48,978 --> 00:34:49,458
Look!

736
00:34:49,458 --> 00:34:50,378
The sun is coming out!

737
00:34:52,778 --> 00:34:53,738
Did you see the deities?

738
00:34:53,738 --> 00:34:54,418
Yes.

739
00:34:55,058 --> 00:34:56,138
You did?

740
00:34:57,058 --> 00:34:57,858
Yes.

741
00:34:58,698 --> 00:34:59,298
She is beautiful.

742
00:35:01,258 --> 00:35:02,818
Do you know the eight-second rule?

743
00:35:03,898 --> 00:35:05,618
When two people look into
each other's eyes for eight seconds,

744
00:35:06,058 --> 00:35:07,938
something unexpected happens.

745
00:35:09,418 --> 00:35:10,218
What will happen?

746
00:35:10,938 --> 00:35:11,618
Count.

747
00:35:12,258 --> 00:35:12,778
Come on.

748
00:35:15,938 --> 00:35:16,538
One.

749
00:35:18,058 --> 00:35:18,578
Two.

750
00:35:20,698 --> 00:35:21,538
Three.

751
00:35:22,858 --> 00:35:24,058
Eight seconds is too long.

00:35:25,732 --> 00:35:29,015

The final segment
before we head back to the city.

765
00:36:14,578 --> 00:36:16,458
Fill out the questionnaires
for my social study survey.

766
00:36:16,978 --> 00:36:18,738
I'm counting on you guys

767
00:36:18,738 --> 00:36:19,778
for my report.

768
00:36:19,778 --> 00:36:20,258
Thanks.

769
00:36:20,978 --> 00:36:21,498
Thank you.

770
00:36:27,018 --> 00:36:29,098
Was there a division of labour
before the trip?

771
00:36:29,578 --> 00:36:30,378
- Yes.
- Yes.

772
00:36:32,258 --> 00:36:34,578
Mainstream or niche?

773
00:36:35,498 --> 00:36:36,658
- Niche.
- Niche.

774
00:36:37,218 --> 00:36:39,258
Scenery or culture?

775
00:36:39,898 --> 00:36:40,778
- Scenery.
- Scenery.

776
00:36:41,618 --> 00:36:43,658
Who makes the call when plans diverge?

777
00:36:44,738 --> 00:36:45,738
- The other person.
- The other person.

778
00:36:46,538 --> 00:36:47,378
- Me.
- Me.

779
00:36:49,058 --> 00:36:50,138
We'll listen to the one who makes sense.

780
00:36:50,498 --> 00:36:51,138
Okay.

781
00:36:53,098 --> 00:36:55,378
Does the other person
have a favorite recreational sport?

782
00:36:56,018 --> 00:36:56,618
Yes.

783
00:36:59,778 --> 00:37:00,378
Yueyue,

784
00:37:00,378 --> 00:37:01,418
what's wrong?

785
00:37:02,538 --> 00:37:05,338
Gao Yunlang and I scored 80
for our tacit understanding.

786
00:37:06,058 --> 00:37:07,418
That's high.

787
00:37:07,418 --> 00:37:09,698
But it didn't meet my expectations.

788
00:37:09,818 --> 00:37:10,898
What about Jiang Yimian and me?

789
00:37:11,178 --> 00:37:12,818
Our answers were completely different.

790
00:37:12,818 --> 00:37:14,138
There's no way we can get a good score.

791
00:37:14,778 --> 00:37:16,698
You guys scored 90.

792
00:37:18,538 --> 00:37:20,058
You must be mistaken.

793
00:37:21,258 --> 00:37:23,578
Big data shows
that we're quite compatible.

794
00:37:23,578 --> 00:37:24,858
Maybe we should
give ourselves another go.

795
00:37:26,338 --> 00:37:26,898
Wow!

796
00:37:27,298 --> 00:37:29,018
We have the highest score among us!

797
00:37:29,378 --> 00:37:31,338
Lin Xi and Ji Junxing scored 100!

798
00:37:32,498 --> 00:37:34,058
Did you guys
match your answers before this?

799
00:37:34,378 --> 00:37:35,778
Of course not.

800
00:37:35,778 --> 00:37:36,898
They're sitting right across from me.

801
00:37:36,898 --> 00:37:37,698
They couldn't have cheated.

802
00:37:40,178 --> 00:37:40,738
Didn't you say

803
00:37:40,738 --> 00:37:41,738
the first-place winners
get a mystery prize?

804
00:37:41,738 --> 00:37:42,578
Give it here.

805
00:37:47,978 --> 00:37:48,738
What is it?

806
00:37:51,098 --> 00:37:53,018
"Bad Mood First Aid Kit"?

807
00:37:54,778 --> 00:37:56,378
I hope we never need this.

808
00:37:57,778 --> 00:37:58,258
Oh, right.

809
00:37:58,258 --> 00:37:58,858
It's the East Gate Squad

810
00:37:58,858 --> 00:37:59,978
and family's first trip together.

811
00:37:59,978 --> 00:38:01,218
Why don't we take a group photo?

812
00:38:01,458 --> 00:38:01,978
- Okay.
- Okay.

813
00:38:01,978 --> 00:38:02,338
Sure!

814
00:38:02,338 --> 00:38:02,778
Come on.

815
00:38:02,778 --> 00:38:03,938
Who is your family?

816
00:38:05,218 --> 00:38:06,178
Let's go over there.

817
00:38:06,178 --> 00:38:07,338
Come on. Let's go.

818
00:38:08,658 --> 00:38:09,658
Mind the cables.

819
00:38:10,658 --> 00:38:11,258
Come on.

820
00:38:12,858 --> 00:38:13,738
Take your places, everyone.

821
00:38:13,738 --> 00:38:14,338
Come on.

822
00:38:14,338 --> 00:38:14,698
How about here?

823
00:38:14,698 --> 00:38:15,338
Take your positions.

824
00:38:17,178 --> 00:38:17,898
Lin Xi and Ji Junxing,

825
00:38:17,898 --> 00:38:18,898
stand closer.

826
00:38:19,498 --> 00:38:22,258
Three, two, one!

827
00:38:22,258 --> 00:38:22,938
Come on!

828
00:38:24,898 --> 00:38:25,618
Let's see the photo.

829
00:38:25,618 --> 00:38:25,978
Come on.

830
00:38:25,978 --> 00:38:26,898
Let's check the photo.

831
00:38:27,618 --> 00:38:28,338
Did it capture all of us?

832
00:38:28,578 --> 00:38:29,418
Yes.

833
00:38:30,258 --> 00:38:30,618
Hello?

834
00:38:30,778 --> 00:38:31,498
Mom?

835
00:38:31,498 --> 00:38:32,298
What's up?

836
00:38:35,058 --> 00:38:35,858
Is it bad?

837
00:38:36,378 --> 00:38:37,618
Stay calm.

838
00:38:39,178 --> 00:38:39,898
Got it.

839
00:38:40,418 --> 00:38:41,218
What's wrong?

840
00:38:42,058 --> 00:38:43,298
