=Episode 21=

17
00:01:58,120 --> 00:01:59,480
What brings you back?

18
00:01:59,840 --> 00:02:01,120
You sounded worried on the phone.

19
00:02:01,120 --> 00:02:02,560
We rushed back as soon as we could.

20
00:02:02,560 --> 00:02:03,280
Aunt.

21
00:02:03,280 --> 00:02:04,320
How is Luchi?

22
00:02:04,320 --> 00:02:05,760
I brought him back from the hospital.

23
00:02:05,760 --> 00:02:07,200
He's asleep.

24
00:02:25,880 --> 00:02:27,320
Why did he pass out?

25
00:02:29,520 --> 00:02:30,440
It was my fault.

26
00:02:30,800 --> 00:02:31,960
He wanted to play soccer.

27
00:02:31,960 --> 00:02:33,120
I wouldn't let him go.

28
00:02:33,120 --> 00:02:35,440
So, he snuck out
to play with his friends.

29
00:02:35,800 --> 00:02:37,040
He got too excited

30
00:02:37,040 --> 00:02:38,040
and was covered in sweat.

31
00:02:38,040 --> 00:02:39,400
Then, he took off his shirt.

32
00:02:40,200 --> 00:02:41,800
He was lightheaded this afternoon.

33
00:02:41,800 --> 00:02:42,800
His friend's mother

34
00:02:42,800 --> 00:02:44,320
sent him to a hospital.

35
00:02:45,080 --> 00:02:46,160
What did the doctor say?

36
00:02:46,480 --> 00:02:47,680
Is it myocarditis?

37
00:02:48,440 --> 00:02:49,080
No.

38
00:02:49,080 --> 00:02:50,400
It's not a heart disease.

39
00:02:50,400 --> 00:02:51,360
He caught a cold.

40
00:02:52,120 --> 00:02:53,440
But I was truly scared.

41
00:02:54,440 --> 00:02:55,240
I'm glad he is alright.

42
00:02:55,560 --> 00:02:56,160
Mom.

43
00:02:56,160 --> 00:02:57,480
Get some rest.

44
00:02:57,480 --> 00:02:58,360
You've been up all night.

45
00:02:59,720 --> 00:03:00,440
I'm not going back.

46
00:03:00,440 --> 00:03:02,200
I can't calm down unless I see him.

47
00:03:03,920 --> 00:03:04,720
Come on, Mom.

48
00:03:05,320 --> 00:03:07,040
You'll get dark circles at this rate.

49
00:03:08,280 --> 00:03:09,760
Do I already have them?

50
00:03:09,760 --> 00:03:10,560
Get some rest.

51
00:03:10,800 --> 00:03:12,040
I can keep watch here.

52
00:03:12,840 --> 00:03:13,240
Well...

53
00:03:13,240 --> 00:03:14,280
Keep an eye on him.

54
00:03:39,520 --> 00:03:40,840
I finally get my strength back.

55
00:03:44,880 --> 00:03:46,200
Luchi has lost weight again.

56
00:03:47,480 --> 00:03:48,960
He is still growing.

57
00:03:49,400 --> 00:03:50,840
He lost almost
2 kilogram after falling sick.

58
00:03:51,440 --> 00:03:52,240
My mom

59
00:03:52,240 --> 00:03:53,640
will be worried about his diet again.

60
00:03:56,240 --> 00:03:57,920
Your mother seemed tensed.

61
00:03:58,200 --> 00:03:59,440
She wasn't acting like herself.

62
00:03:59,840 --> 00:04:01,000
Madam Wen Xuan

63
00:04:01,480 --> 00:04:03,040
has no fear,
even if the sky is falling down.

64
00:04:03,280 --> 00:04:04,800
She only gets so worried

65
00:04:04,800 --> 00:04:06,120
when Ji Luchi is sick.

66
00:04:07,600 --> 00:04:10,200
But it's normal for a boy to be playful.

67
00:04:10,640 --> 00:04:11,840
We can't keep him from exercising or

68
00:04:11,840 --> 00:04:12,840
playing soccer.

69
00:04:14,840 --> 00:04:16,680
He only wants to be like other kids.

70
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:21,920
Maybe

71
00:04:21,920 --> 00:04:22,680
we can come back

72
00:04:22,680 --> 00:04:23,880
and visit him when there's no class.

73
00:04:24,360 --> 00:04:25,760
That should put your mind to ease.

74
00:04:28,120 --> 00:04:30,560
I wonder if there is a device

75
00:04:31,280 --> 00:04:32,200
we can use to monitor

76
00:04:32,200 --> 00:04:33,640
his health at all time.

77
00:04:59,080 --> 00:04:59,600
Mom.

78
00:05:06,160 --> 00:05:06,960
Sister Lin Xi!

79
00:05:07,120 --> 00:05:08,640
Why are you holding my brother?

80
00:05:09,920 --> 00:05:10,520
What?

81
00:05:10,520 --> 00:05:11,440
She was only leaning on me.

82
00:05:11,440 --> 00:05:12,480
It's been that way all night.

83
00:05:12,880 --> 00:05:13,200
Mom,

84
00:05:13,200 --> 00:05:14,120
they are dating.

85
00:05:14,440 --> 00:05:15,640
They are grown-ups.

86
00:05:15,640 --> 00:05:17,120
It's normal for them to be in love.

87
00:05:17,120 --> 00:05:18,200
Can I do that too?

88
00:05:18,840 --> 00:05:20,000
Take your medicine.

89
00:05:26,960 --> 00:05:28,360
How about now?

90
00:05:28,720 --> 00:05:30,320
Not a chance.

91
00:05:33,840 --> 00:05:34,680
By the way,

92
00:05:34,680 --> 00:05:35,760
I made some dumplings.

93
00:05:36,120 --> 00:05:37,240
Have some before you leave.

94
00:05:40,480 --> 00:05:42,360
I think he's doing fine now.

95
00:05:43,360 --> 00:05:44,320
Agreed.

96
00:05:48,300 --> 00:05:52,660
(One year later)

97
00:05:55,840 --> 00:05:57,520
The lesson just now was about the heart.

98
00:05:57,800 --> 00:05:59,000
I couldn't think
of anything but Ji Luchi.

99
00:05:59,400 --> 00:06:00,520
How is he lately?

100
00:06:00,880 --> 00:06:01,680
Not bad.

101
00:06:02,040 --> 00:06:03,840
He said after thinking about it,

102
00:06:04,160 --> 00:06:05,320
he's decided that

103
00:06:05,320 --> 00:06:06,280
brain exercises suit him better.

104
00:06:06,760 --> 00:06:08,000
He asked me to be his mentor.

105
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:09,800
He never stops bugging me
with programming.

106
00:06:10,160 --> 00:06:12,200
Someone doesn't seem happy.

107
00:06:13,960 --> 00:06:15,360
What are they looking at?

108
00:06:16,200 --> 00:06:18,160
It's a city-level
entrepreneurship contest.

109
00:06:18,400 --> 00:06:20,000
My teacher mentioned it.

110
00:06:20,880 --> 00:06:22,840
A Rising Star, A Better Future.

111
00:06:23,120 --> 00:06:24,280
(Start-up Competition)
If you have an idea,

112
00:06:24,280 --> 00:06:25,920
we can turn it into a product.

113
00:06:26,200 --> 00:06:27,400
If you have a product,

114
00:06:27,400 --> 00:06:28,600
we can find you a suitable market.

115
00:06:28,880 --> 00:06:30,080
Future entrepreneurs,

116
00:06:30,080 --> 00:06:31,480
we want you.

117
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:33,160
(Total prize: 3.6 million yuan)
The prize reaches 3.6 million yuan!

118
00:06:33,160 --> 00:06:33,920
That's a lot!

119
00:06:35,200 --> 00:06:36,800
The prize is handsome,

120
00:06:36,800 --> 00:06:37,640
but the bar is set pretty high.

121
00:06:37,920 --> 00:06:39,440
Anyone who's nominated

122
00:06:39,440 --> 00:06:41,200
will very likely find success
as an entrepreneur.

123
00:06:41,560 --> 00:06:42,960
The judges include professors, experts,

124
00:06:42,960 --> 00:06:43,920
and prominent venture capitalists.

125
00:06:44,360 --> 00:06:45,880
The previous gold-prize winner

126
00:06:45,880 --> 00:06:46,920
got an angel investment

127
00:06:46,920 --> 00:06:48,560
and is now a unicorn.

128
00:06:50,200 --> 00:06:52,640
Maybe this is our chance.

129
00:06:53,120 --> 00:06:54,000
What chance?

130
00:06:54,520 --> 00:06:55,080
You wanted to make

131
00:06:55,080 --> 00:06:56,480
a heart-rate monitor.

132
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:17,960
What are you drawing?

133
00:07:18,400 --> 00:07:19,600
A smart band?

134
00:07:21,600 --> 00:07:23,000
I want to make a demo along

135
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:24,360
with the business proposal.

136
00:07:24,960 --> 00:07:26,400
A sports smart band?

137
00:07:27,440 --> 00:07:27,960
No.

138
00:07:28,280 --> 00:07:29,480
I want to make

139
00:07:29,480 --> 00:07:31,680
a smart band specialized
for people like Ji Luchi.

140
00:07:32,560 --> 00:07:34,440
The precision must be
suitable for medical uses.

141
00:07:38,920 --> 00:07:41,280
Aside from monitoring heart rate,

142
00:07:41,480 --> 00:07:43,120
it must include blood pressure,
blood oxygen level,

143
00:07:43,120 --> 00:07:44,120
and an ECG.

144
00:07:44,680 --> 00:07:45,120
Yes.

145
00:07:45,680 --> 00:07:46,800
When connected to the apps,

146
00:07:46,800 --> 00:07:48,440
the smart band can monitor
all kinds of data.

147
00:07:48,920 --> 00:07:50,200
When there is an abnormality,

148
00:07:50,480 --> 00:07:51,800
the guardian will be notified

149
00:07:51,800 --> 00:07:52,840
and warned.

150
00:07:53,420 --> 00:07:54,620
(Bluetooth device paired)

151
00:07:54,620 --> 00:07:56,180
(Breathing icon, ECG, heartbeat)

152
00:07:57,760 --> 00:07:59,800
How can it tell if the abnormality is

153
00:07:59,800 --> 00:08:01,280
spontaneous or pathological?

154
00:08:03,400 --> 00:08:04,840
My concept is that

155
00:08:05,040 --> 00:08:06,640
the smart band will
work with the hospital.

156
00:08:07,040 --> 00:08:08,000
Before using it,

157
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:10,480
the user must input
some basic details of their conditions.

158
00:08:10,480 --> 00:08:12,560
If the symptoms
match the medical records,

159
00:08:12,560 --> 00:08:14,320
it can deduce that it's pathological.

160
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:19,760
(Safe)

161
00:08:22,440 --> 00:08:23,520
(Danger)

162
00:08:23,640 --> 00:08:25,160
It sounds good.

163
00:08:25,680 --> 00:08:26,360
A partnership can

164
00:08:26,360 --> 00:08:27,760
help us notify the hospital immediately.

165
00:08:28,200 --> 00:08:29,240
Do you find it doable too?

166
00:08:29,280 --> 00:08:30,360
Sure!

167
00:08:31,920 --> 00:08:34,440
But it sounds pretty hard to execute.

168
00:08:35,520 --> 00:08:36,680
Where should we start?

169
00:08:36,680 --> 00:08:37,640
Are you sure you can do this?

170
00:08:40,440 --> 00:08:41,600
I must first brush up on my knowledge

171
00:08:41,600 --> 00:08:43,360
of the human heart.

172
00:08:50,160 --> 00:08:51,920
These are the 20 most common

173
00:08:51,920 --> 00:08:54,600
abnormal ECGs.

174
00:08:55,120 --> 00:08:56,920
Revise afterward.

175
00:08:57,640 --> 00:08:58,720
For the next lecture,

176
00:08:58,960 --> 00:09:00,440
I'll do a random quiz.

177
00:09:00,920 --> 00:09:01,840
Is that clear?

178
00:09:01,840 --> 00:09:02,560
Yes.

179
00:09:03,400 --> 00:09:03,800
Alright.

180
00:09:03,800 --> 00:09:05,080
That's all for today.

181
00:09:05,320 --> 00:09:05,880
Dismissed.

182
00:09:11,280 --> 00:09:11,880
Sir.

183
00:09:12,600 --> 00:09:13,320
May I ask you

184
00:09:13,320 --> 00:09:14,360
a few questions?

185
00:09:14,360 --> 00:09:15,240
Ask away.

186
00:09:15,240 --> 00:09:16,640
Can we identify CVD

187
00:09:16,640 --> 00:09:18,480
based on the ECGs alone?

188
00:09:18,480 --> 00:09:19,560
Of course not.

189
00:09:20,280 --> 00:09:20,960
For example,

190
00:09:20,960 --> 00:09:22,000
the P pulmonale

191
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:22,960
we discussed earlier.

192
00:09:23,400 --> 00:09:24,560
Aside from cardiopulmonary disease

193
00:09:24,560 --> 00:09:25,640
and pulmonary hypertension,

194
00:09:25,640 --> 00:09:26,200
the patient

195
00:09:26,200 --> 00:09:27,280
suffering from hyperthyroidism

196
00:09:27,280 --> 00:09:28,600
will manifest these symptoms.

197
00:09:29,520 --> 00:09:30,800
What other data do we need

198
00:09:30,960 --> 00:09:31,880
to identify CVD

199
00:09:31,880 --> 00:09:33,160
aside from the ECGs?

200
00:09:33,800 --> 00:09:34,880
It's pretty complicated.

201
00:09:36,400 --> 00:09:37,040
What?

202
00:09:37,840 --> 00:09:38,880
Are you ditching this major?

203
00:09:41,280 --> 00:09:42,880
You must be Lin Xi's boyfriend.

204
00:09:43,960 --> 00:09:45,440
You'd study to be a doctor

205
00:09:45,440 --> 00:09:46,960
just to be with your girlfriend?

206
00:09:47,440 --> 00:09:48,520
Mr. Wang.

207
00:09:48,520 --> 00:09:50,040
I didn't ask him to do that.

208
00:09:50,040 --> 00:09:50,640
I'd face

209
00:09:50,640 --> 00:09:51,760
divine punishment if I did.

210
00:09:52,600 --> 00:09:53,360
We want to make

211
00:09:53,360 --> 00:09:55,240
a heart monitor band.

212
00:09:55,800 --> 00:09:57,280
That sounds interesting.

213
00:09:58,280 --> 00:10:00,360
However, I doubt I can help you.

214
00:10:01,120 --> 00:10:01,680
Look.

215
00:10:02,200 --> 00:10:03,800
Let me recommend you to an expert,

216
00:10:03,800 --> 00:10:04,720
Professor Chen.

217
00:10:05,240 --> 00:10:06,560
He has medical knowledge

218
00:10:06,560 --> 00:10:07,800
and he knows programming.

219
00:10:07,800 --> 00:10:10,280
There are only a handful
of cross-field experts like him.

220
00:10:10,600 --> 00:10:11,080
Look.

221
00:10:11,320 --> 00:10:12,680
I'll send you the address.

222
00:10:12,920 --> 00:10:14,000
Go to him instead.

223
00:10:14,680 --> 00:10:15,640
I'll give him a heads-up.

224
00:10:15,640 --> 00:10:16,400
Thank you, sir.

225
00:10:16,400 --> 00:10:16,680
Don't mention it.

226
00:10:16,680 --> 00:10:17,400
Thank you, Mr. Wang.

227
00:10:17,400 --> 00:10:18,000
You're welcome.

228
00:10:18,960 --> 00:10:19,480
Let's go.

229
00:10:21,600 --> 00:10:22,520
Where is it?

230
00:10:23,040 --> 00:10:24,040
It's 2-2.

231
00:10:24,040 --> 00:10:25,160
It's 2-02.

232
00:10:27,840 --> 00:10:28,440
This is it.

233
00:10:28,440 --> 00:10:29,480
It's 1-01.

234
00:10:31,480 --> 00:10:32,400
This should be it.

235
00:10:34,120 --> 00:10:34,920
Mr. Wang warned us

236
00:10:34,920 --> 00:10:36,040
Professor Chen is eccentric.

237
00:10:36,040 --> 00:10:37,000
We should be careful.

238
00:10:37,400 --> 00:10:38,560
How bad can it be?

239
00:10:38,560 --> 00:10:39,760
We'll show him good manners.

240
00:10:47,680 --> 00:10:48,520
Professor Chen?

241
00:10:48,520 --> 00:10:49,480
Are you home?

242
00:10:51,880 --> 00:10:53,520
Maybe he didn't hear the knocking.

243
00:10:55,840 --> 00:10:56,880
Professor Chen!

244
00:10:57,800 --> 00:10:59,160
Professor Chen, are you home?

245
00:11:02,360 --> 00:11:03,720
Why are you banging on my door?

246
00:11:04,200 --> 00:11:05,520
I thought you were tearing it down.

247
00:11:05,920 --> 00:11:06,680
Professor Chen.

248
00:11:06,680 --> 00:11:08,160
We are both students from the school.

249
00:11:08,160 --> 00:11:09,240
I major in Computer Science.

250
00:11:09,640 --> 00:11:10,880
I'm from the medical school.

251
00:11:11,680 --> 00:11:12,240
The thing is,

252
00:11:12,520 --> 00:11:13,400
we want to make

253
00:11:13,400 --> 00:11:14,360
a smart band capable of

254
00:11:14,360 --> 00:11:16,240
monitoring heart-related
data for 24 hours.

255
00:11:16,640 --> 00:11:16,960
So...

256
00:11:16,960 --> 00:11:17,600
I'm busy.

257
00:11:28,080 --> 00:11:29,120
Professor Chen!

258
00:11:29,560 --> 00:11:30,640
Please hear us out!

259
00:11:30,640 --> 00:11:31,480
Professor Chen!

260
00:11:35,320 --> 00:11:35,960
I know very well

261
00:11:35,960 --> 00:11:37,280
what you're trying to do.

262
00:11:37,640 --> 00:11:39,480
It's about the entrepreneurship contest!

263
00:11:40,520 --> 00:11:41,920
A bunch of students like you

264
00:11:41,920 --> 00:11:43,160
come to me this time of the year

265
00:11:43,160 --> 00:11:44,080
every year!

266
00:11:44,360 --> 00:11:45,800
You want an expert on the cover

267
00:11:46,120 --> 00:11:47,520
to get yourselves a pretty resume.

268
00:11:48,040 --> 00:11:48,800
You got the wrong guy.

269
00:11:48,800 --> 00:11:49,680
I'm not doing this.

270
00:11:50,480 --> 00:11:51,120
Professor Chen!

271
00:12:00,280 --> 00:12:02,000
A tall forehead, pointy ears,

272
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:03,200
wide eyes

273
00:12:03,200 --> 00:12:04,000
on a baby face,

274
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:05,120
and a prominent center line!

275
00:12:05,600 --> 00:12:06,320
Highly customizable.

276
00:12:06,320 --> 00:12:07,040
Miss,

277
00:12:07,040 --> 00:12:07,720
may I recommend you

278
00:12:07,720 --> 00:12:09,560
our Summertime Vitamin C Makeup?

279
00:12:10,920 --> 00:12:11,880
Have you gone insane?

280
00:12:11,880 --> 00:12:12,920
That's not even a human.

281
00:12:12,920 --> 00:12:14,200
It's more like an elf.

282
00:12:14,200 --> 00:12:14,680
Sir,

283
00:12:14,680 --> 00:12:15,200
I suggest

284
00:12:15,200 --> 00:12:16,760
you see an eye specialist.

285
00:12:17,080 --> 00:12:18,120
That's what you look like.

286
00:12:18,120 --> 00:12:18,920
People never

287
00:12:18,920 --> 00:12:19,960
understand themselves.

288
00:12:20,680 --> 00:12:21,440
Onto the next one.

289
00:12:22,080 --> 00:12:23,120
A vigorous forehead.

290
00:12:23,120 --> 00:12:24,080
A rounded chin.

291
00:12:24,440 --> 00:12:26,360
Your eyes are sharp with wits.

292
00:12:26,360 --> 00:12:27,760
Your nose is blunt and adorable.

293
00:12:27,760 --> 00:12:29,200
The outline of your face is smooth.

294
00:12:29,480 --> 00:12:29,960
Miss.

295
00:12:30,240 --> 00:12:32,520
May I recommend you
our Peach Milktea Makeup?

296
00:12:34,240 --> 00:12:35,360
What is wrong with him now?

297
00:12:36,400 --> 00:12:38,160
He wants to make
an automated makeup machine

298
00:12:38,160 --> 00:12:39,280
for the entrepreneurship contest.

299
00:12:40,120 --> 00:12:41,240
Now...

300
00:12:41,240 --> 00:12:42,160
Hold on.

301
00:12:42,160 --> 00:12:43,560
I know what I look like.

302
00:12:43,880 --> 00:12:44,360
But what about

303
00:12:44,360 --> 00:12:45,440
the makeup that suits you?

304
00:12:45,680 --> 00:12:46,840
A cynical makeup

305
00:12:46,840 --> 00:12:48,200
suits your poker face.

306
00:12:49,640 --> 00:12:51,000
I am pretty cynical now.

307
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:52,560
I got turned away several times.

308
00:12:52,960 --> 00:12:53,960
What is it?

309
00:12:53,960 --> 00:12:55,000
Having trouble with the product?

310
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:55,400
Tell me.

311
00:12:55,400 --> 00:12:56,240
I could give you a word of advice.

312
00:12:56,840 --> 00:12:58,280
We need a technical consultant,

313
00:12:58,280 --> 00:12:59,600
but he wouldn't see us.

314
00:13:00,040 --> 00:13:01,160
That's all?

315
00:13:01,160 --> 00:13:02,280
It's easy.

316
00:13:02,280 --> 00:13:02,920
Trust me on this.

317
00:13:03,360 --> 00:13:05,080
Entrepreneurship is
not just about the product.

318
00:13:05,400 --> 00:13:07,000
More importantly,
it's about dealing with people.

319
00:13:07,440 --> 00:13:09,640
For that, you need plans and stratagem.

320
00:13:09,920 --> 00:13:11,760
Quality over quantity.

321
00:13:11,760 --> 00:13:12,680
Effective communication is needed.

322
00:13:13,240 --> 00:13:14,040
Get to the point.

323
00:13:14,360 --> 00:13:16,560
In layman's terms, keep bugging him.

324
00:13:33,360 --> 00:13:34,160
Professor Chen?

325
00:13:38,600 --> 00:13:39,640
Why are you here again?

326
00:13:40,120 --> 00:13:40,600
Professor Chen.

327
00:13:40,600 --> 00:13:41,440
We didn't come

328
00:13:41,440 --> 00:13:42,680
to seek your help.

329
00:13:43,320 --> 00:13:44,480
We brought you breakfast.

330
00:13:44,840 --> 00:13:45,640
Take it.

331
00:13:45,640 --> 00:13:46,400
The food is hot.

332
00:13:46,400 --> 00:13:46,960
Bye.

333
00:13:47,160 --> 00:13:48,000
- Bye, Professor Chen.
- Bye, Professor Chen.

334
00:14:06,560 --> 00:14:07,320
Professor.

335
00:14:07,320 --> 00:14:08,320
Leave it to us.

336
00:14:14,040 --> 00:14:14,600
Professor.

337
00:14:14,600 --> 00:14:15,120
Take it.

338
00:14:15,120 --> 00:14:16,040
I hope you like it.

339
00:14:16,040 --> 00:14:16,640
It's for you.

340
00:14:16,640 --> 00:14:17,080
Bye.

341
00:14:24,280 --> 00:14:24,880
Professor.

342
00:14:24,880 --> 00:14:25,800
Your parcel.

343
00:14:25,800 --> 00:14:26,800
See you later.

344
00:14:33,120 --> 00:14:34,040
Professor.

345
00:14:34,040 --> 00:14:35,080
Enjoy the watermelon.

346
00:14:35,600 --> 00:14:36,400
Bye, Professor Chen.

347
00:14:36,400 --> 00:14:37,200
Bye.

348
00:14:42,240 --> 00:14:43,720
How am I supposed to finish this?

349
00:15:11,480 --> 00:15:12,080
Professor.

350
00:15:12,080 --> 00:15:13,200
What happened?

351
00:15:13,880 --> 00:15:15,000
I forgot to turn off the faucet.

352
00:15:15,400 --> 00:15:15,880
Leave.

353
00:15:15,880 --> 00:15:16,960
Don't cause me more trouble.

354
00:15:20,960 --> 00:15:21,760
Professor Chen.

355
00:15:21,760 --> 00:15:22,680
Where do we put the books?

356
00:15:22,920 --> 00:15:23,480
Whatever.

357
00:15:23,480 --> 00:15:24,520
Put them where it's dry.

358
00:15:25,240 --> 00:15:26,360
Do you have a bookshelf?

359
00:15:26,640 --> 00:15:27,280
See for yourself.

360
00:15:27,280 --> 00:15:28,360
It's already full.

361
00:15:28,360 --> 00:15:29,680
I put the rest on the floor.

362
00:15:30,280 --> 00:15:31,280
Let's stack them up.

363
00:15:31,800 --> 00:15:32,440
Yes.

364
00:15:37,160 --> 00:15:38,200
It's all drenched.

365
00:15:40,480 --> 00:15:41,040
Hello?

366
00:15:43,560 --> 00:15:44,400
Are you stuck again?

367
00:15:46,360 --> 00:15:47,520
That is a little complicated.

368
00:15:47,520 --> 00:15:48,600
It's hard to explain.

369
00:15:48,920 --> 00:15:49,800
We need to run tests.

370
00:15:54,200 --> 00:15:55,880
I can't leave right now.

371
00:15:59,440 --> 00:16:00,160
Professor,

372
00:16:00,160 --> 00:16:01,200
we can take care of the place.

373
00:16:01,200 --> 00:16:02,120
Feel free to go.

374
00:16:05,320 --> 00:16:06,480
Alright, wait there.

375
00:16:06,480 --> 00:16:07,440
I'm on my way.

376
00:16:08,320 --> 00:16:09,280
I'm counting on you.

377
00:16:13,120 --> 00:16:14,000
Ji Junxing.

378
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:14,720
Carry the books.

379
00:16:14,720 --> 00:16:15,360
I'll get rid of the water.

380
00:16:15,360 --> 00:16:15,760
Okay.

381
00:16:22,640 --> 00:16:24,000
There are manuscripts here.

382
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:25,160
They are all soaking wet.

383
00:16:25,880 --> 00:16:27,080
The writings are blurred.

384
00:16:28,920 --> 00:16:29,800
Leave them out to dry.

385
00:16:32,080 --> 00:16:32,840
There are more here.

386
00:16:33,560 --> 00:16:34,480
There are so many of them.

387
00:16:37,120 --> 00:16:38,000
Stick it here.

388
00:17:17,160 --> 00:17:18,840
Professor Chen.

389
00:17:19,040 --> 00:17:19,840
You're back.

390
00:17:22,280 --> 00:17:23,000
Sorry.

391
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:24,200
We got a little tired from the cleaning.

392
00:17:24,200 --> 00:17:25,480
We were taking a break,

393
00:17:25,480 --> 00:17:26,520
but we fell asleep.

394
00:17:26,520 --> 00:17:27,080
If there's nothing else,

395
00:17:27,080 --> 00:17:28,240
we should get going.

396
00:17:32,720 --> 00:17:33,480
Hey.

397
00:17:35,560 --> 00:17:36,320
Did you have anything?

398
00:17:38,880 --> 00:17:40,000
No.

399
00:17:42,400 --> 00:17:43,080
Come in.

400
00:17:51,720 --> 00:17:52,920
I thought we were getting

401
00:17:52,920 --> 00:17:53,680
something nicer.

402
00:17:54,560 --> 00:17:56,280
There are just some buns.

403
00:17:56,280 --> 00:17:56,720
You don't want it?

404
00:17:56,720 --> 00:17:57,240
Very well.

405
00:17:57,240 --> 00:17:58,120
Wait.

406
00:17:58,120 --> 00:17:58,760
I want the bun.

407
00:17:59,080 --> 00:18:00,160
I'm exhausted from the cleaning.

408
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:01,720
We mustn't starve ourselves.

409
00:18:11,240 --> 00:18:13,760
Is this all you ever eat?

410
00:18:14,080 --> 00:18:15,600
Do you eat buns for every meal?

411
00:18:16,280 --> 00:18:17,120
What's wrong with that?

412
00:18:17,720 --> 00:18:19,680
They have vegetables, meat, and carbs.

413
00:18:19,680 --> 00:18:20,600
And no dishes to wash.

414
00:18:22,920 --> 00:18:24,520
We should bring you some buns next time.

415
00:18:29,880 --> 00:18:30,600
You two

416
00:18:30,960 --> 00:18:32,080
are relentless.

417
00:18:33,920 --> 00:18:34,680
Come on.

418
00:18:35,480 --> 00:18:36,520
What's the smart band for?

419
00:18:39,360 --> 00:18:40,360
Do you agree to help us?

420
00:18:40,600 --> 00:18:41,520
I've agreed to nothing.

421
00:18:43,320 --> 00:18:44,640
I want to make the smart band

422
00:18:45,520 --> 00:18:46,560
not on a whim

423
00:18:46,960 --> 00:18:48,160
or for the sake of winning the contest.

424
00:18:48,600 --> 00:18:49,720
My brother has heart problems.

425
00:18:50,400 --> 00:18:51,960
He had a heart transplant.

426
00:18:52,640 --> 00:18:53,160
I know

427
00:18:53,160 --> 00:18:54,920
a heart attack can come out of nowhere

428
00:18:55,400 --> 00:18:56,720
and the window
to save him is very small.

429
00:18:57,320 --> 00:18:58,840
If we can make a product

430
00:18:59,080 --> 00:19:00,560
that detects the attack in time,

431
00:19:01,360 --> 00:19:02,400
we can save at least

432
00:19:02,400 --> 00:19:03,640
two million people every year.

433
00:19:16,200 --> 00:19:17,040
Do you know

434
00:19:17,560 --> 00:19:19,520
how much time and effort are needed

435
00:19:20,040 --> 00:19:22,480
to produce a medical-grade band

436
00:19:23,040 --> 00:19:23,960
like this?

437
00:19:25,160 --> 00:19:26,200
We never planned to

438
00:19:26,200 --> 00:19:27,480
make it happen right away.

439
00:19:28,080 --> 00:19:29,280
It could take three

440
00:19:29,280 --> 00:19:30,120
or five years,

441
00:19:30,560 --> 00:19:31,640
or much longer.

442
00:19:32,400 --> 00:19:33,520
But I want to try nonetheless.

443
00:19:42,320 --> 00:19:43,080
What about you?

444
00:19:43,680 --> 00:19:45,240
I don't mind eating only buns.

445
00:19:47,840 --> 00:19:48,480
Very well.

446
00:19:49,880 --> 00:19:51,200
Bring the list of questions here

447
00:19:51,880 --> 00:19:52,960
on your next visit.

448
00:19:54,360 --> 00:19:55,400
- Thank you, Professor Chen.
- Thank you, Professor Chen.

449
00:19:55,400 --> 00:19:56,080
Don't thank me.

450
00:19:57,000 --> 00:19:57,960
When you're here,

451
00:19:58,480 --> 00:19:59,720
you follow my rules.

452
00:20:00,200 --> 00:20:01,480
You're not allowed to give up.

453
00:20:02,600 --> 00:20:03,680
No tardiness is allowed.

454
00:20:04,800 --> 00:20:05,840
No more gifts

455
00:20:07,120 --> 00:20:07,920
but bring more questions.

456
00:20:09,360 --> 00:20:10,240
- No problem!
- No problem!

457
00:20:24,680 --> 00:20:25,600
The accelerometer

458
00:20:25,600 --> 00:20:26,600
can acquire

459
00:20:26,600 --> 00:20:29,000
the acceleration of three axes.

460
00:20:29,640 --> 00:20:30,760
When it's still,

461
00:20:30,760 --> 00:20:31,680
the total acceleration

462
00:20:31,680 --> 00:20:33,360
will create waves around
the gravitational acceleration.

463
00:20:33,640 --> 00:20:35,040
Via different waves,

464
00:20:35,040 --> 00:20:37,640
we can monitor and record steps
and sleep quality in real-time.

465
00:20:38,240 --> 00:20:39,920
Do you get it?

466
00:20:42,440 --> 00:20:43,400
If you didn't get it,

467
00:20:43,720 --> 00:20:45,240
go home and revise it until you do.

468
00:20:45,720 --> 00:20:46,960
Next, the computing

469
00:20:46,960 --> 00:20:48,240
of footsteps.

470
00:20:49,760 --> 00:20:51,480
The calculation is...

471
00:21:03,320 --> 00:21:04,200
Professor Chen.

472
00:21:04,840 --> 00:21:05,600
I spent the entire day

473
00:21:05,600 --> 00:21:06,400
doing this.

474
00:21:06,400 --> 00:21:07,280
Have a look.

475
00:21:07,280 --> 00:21:08,200
Okay, I'll have a look.

476
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:18,600
Move.

477
00:21:22,240 --> 00:21:22,800
Move again.

478
00:21:27,840 --> 00:21:28,960
The sensitivity is too low.

479
00:21:30,120 --> 00:21:30,880
Are you making a relic?

480
00:21:32,840 --> 00:21:34,720
But this reaction time is already

481
00:21:34,720 --> 00:21:35,960
one of the best.

482
00:21:36,280 --> 00:21:37,800
It is for now,

483
00:21:37,800 --> 00:21:39,560
but it might be overtaken tomorrow.

484
00:21:41,640 --> 00:21:42,280
Don't get too proud

485
00:21:42,280 --> 00:21:43,880
because you are one of the brightest

486
00:21:43,880 --> 00:21:44,960
in Computer Science.

487
00:21:44,960 --> 00:21:46,720
Do not be content with the present.

488
00:21:46,720 --> 00:21:47,960
Strive to surpass the limits.

489
00:21:48,360 --> 00:21:49,120
Is that clear?

490
00:21:51,440 --> 00:21:52,040
Alright.

491
00:21:53,640 --> 00:21:55,360
I'll make some adjustments.

492
00:22:01,600 --> 00:22:03,200
If you don't present
the adjustments today,

493
00:22:03,600 --> 00:22:04,600
don't bother coming here again.

494
00:22:06,280 --> 00:22:06,960
Understood.

495
00:22:27,920 --> 00:22:28,640
Relax.

496
00:22:32,960 --> 00:22:33,480
There it is.

497
00:22:33,480 --> 00:22:34,480
We can see the ECG.

498
00:22:34,720 --> 00:22:35,200
Is that so?

499
00:22:35,520 --> 00:22:36,120
Let me have a look.

500
00:22:39,840 --> 00:22:42,560
Next, connect it to the ECG monitor.

501
00:23:06,880 --> 00:23:07,520
Well?

502
00:23:07,800 --> 00:23:08,880
The data shown on the smart band

503
00:23:09,120 --> 00:23:10,640
has slight difference
from the ECG monitor.

504
00:23:11,680 --> 00:23:12,880
The smart band can only do less

505
00:23:12,880 --> 00:23:15,280
with the ECG.

506
00:23:16,760 --> 00:23:17,400
In any case,

507
00:23:17,400 --> 00:23:18,720
let's make the smart band.

508
00:23:19,120 --> 00:23:20,240
Without it,

509
00:23:20,240 --> 00:23:21,520
no ideas will come to fruition.

510
00:23:21,960 --> 00:23:23,240
But with an actual prototype,

511
00:23:23,520 --> 00:23:26,160
upgrading it will be much easier.

512
00:23:26,720 --> 00:23:27,280
Alright.

513
00:23:59,680 --> 00:24:00,720
It's done.

514
00:24:01,240 --> 00:24:02,040
Let's witness the birth

515
00:24:02,040 --> 00:24:03,560
of the prototype band.

516
00:24:09,680 --> 00:24:12,040
This is a smart band?

517
00:24:12,040 --> 00:24:13,560
It looks like

518
00:24:13,560 --> 00:24:14,960
Spider-Man's web shooter.

519
00:24:14,960 --> 00:24:16,640
It's a prototype model.

520
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:18,800
The first-ever computer
weighed over 30 tons.

521
00:24:18,800 --> 00:24:20,280
It was 150 square meters wide.

522
00:24:20,960 --> 00:24:22,520
It was about
the size of our lecture hall.

523
00:24:23,080 --> 00:24:24,720
We can upgrade it later on.

524
00:24:26,040 --> 00:24:28,400
I still find it extraordinary.

525
00:24:29,160 --> 00:24:31,800
An idea actually turned
into a real thing in life.

526
00:24:32,920 --> 00:24:33,680
Should we give it a try?

527
00:24:33,960 --> 00:24:34,720
Yes!

528
00:24:45,280 --> 00:24:45,920
Stay still.

529
00:24:55,400 --> 00:24:56,040
Stay still.

530
00:25:01,840 --> 00:25:02,640
It's lighting up.

531
00:25:03,600 --> 00:25:04,560
I wonder if it's precise.

532
00:25:19,680 --> 00:25:21,000
It's pretty precise.

533
00:25:21,240 --> 00:25:22,920
It blinks with every heartbeat.

534
00:25:25,200 --> 00:25:26,920
This is just a prototype.

535
00:25:27,360 --> 00:25:29,280
The precision will
be increased over time.

536
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:32,040
Do you need some experiment subjects?

537
00:25:32,480 --> 00:25:33,480
I could get you some.

538
00:25:33,760 --> 00:25:34,640
Sure.

539
00:25:43,120 --> 00:25:45,520
Everyone, all the games today

540
00:25:45,520 --> 00:25:46,840
will be paid for by Ji Junxing and me.

541
00:25:46,840 --> 00:25:48,760
They are all free.

542
00:25:49,080 --> 00:25:49,960
How generous of you.

543
00:25:50,200 --> 00:25:51,440
Is your family business going public?

544
00:25:51,680 --> 00:25:52,560
Not at all.

545
00:25:52,560 --> 00:25:54,120
We need your help

546
00:25:54,120 --> 00:25:55,160
with some tests.

547
00:25:55,440 --> 00:25:56,560
I knew it.

548
00:25:56,560 --> 00:25:58,200
There was a catch behind his smile.

549
00:25:58,440 --> 00:25:59,560
Come clean. What are the tests?

550
00:26:00,120 --> 00:26:01,680
Put the smart band on.

551
00:26:01,680 --> 00:26:03,360
Read your pulse
and count your heartbeat.

552
00:26:03,360 --> 00:26:03,880
Here you go.

553
00:26:04,240 --> 00:26:06,040
We want to test its precision.

554
00:26:06,520 --> 00:26:08,440
It doesn't look very smart.

555
00:26:08,720 --> 00:26:10,560
This is already version 3.0.

556
00:26:10,560 --> 00:26:11,640
You'd know how good it is now

557
00:26:11,640 --> 00:26:12,920
if you saw the prototype.

558
00:26:13,640 --> 00:26:14,520
Why does it look like

559
00:26:14,520 --> 00:26:15,720
the same smart band my niece

560
00:26:15,720 --> 00:26:16,720
in kindergarten wears?

561
00:26:17,520 --> 00:26:18,400
It's possible.

562
00:26:18,640 --> 00:26:20,360
I bought
the children's smart band online.

563
00:26:20,360 --> 00:26:22,120
I modified the shell
to fit my internals.

564
00:26:24,640 --> 00:26:25,600
So this is why you've been

565
00:26:25,600 --> 00:26:26,320
acting so mysterious

566
00:26:26,320 --> 00:26:27,520
for the past few months.

567
00:26:27,840 --> 00:26:28,560
Congratulations.

568
00:26:28,880 --> 00:26:30,240
You are the first batch of

569
00:26:30,240 --> 00:26:31,640
test subjects for our smart band.

570
00:26:31,880 --> 00:26:33,320
Are we your lab rats now?

571
00:26:33,920 --> 00:26:35,440
It's not that bad.

572
00:26:35,440 --> 00:26:36,480
We only need you

573
00:26:36,800 --> 00:26:38,440
to do us a small favor.

574
00:26:47,480 --> 00:26:48,080
Remember

575
00:26:48,080 --> 00:26:49,720
to check your pulse.

576
00:26:49,720 --> 00:26:50,920
Okay.

577
00:27:02,760 --> 00:27:03,320
Relax.

578
00:27:03,320 --> 00:27:04,440
It's not that scary.

579
00:27:16,120 --> 00:27:17,480
How is your heart rate?

580
00:27:17,760 --> 00:27:18,600
110.

581
00:27:19,560 --> 00:27:20,600
Yueyue, how's yours?

582
00:27:20,600 --> 00:27:22,680
Mine is 80 to 120.

583
00:27:22,680 --> 00:27:24,400
The difference is too big.

584
00:27:25,840 --> 00:27:27,000
Xie Ang, how is yours?

585
00:27:27,680 --> 00:27:28,440
180.

586
00:27:28,720 --> 00:27:30,200
- 180?
- 180?

587
00:27:30,200 --> 00:27:31,720
Are you even human?

588
00:27:31,720 --> 00:27:33,240
Who would count their own heartbeat

589
00:27:33,240 --> 00:27:34,360
on a drop tower?

590
00:27:34,920 --> 00:27:35,440
It could have given me

591
00:27:35,440 --> 00:27:36,400
a heart attack.

592
00:27:36,720 --> 00:27:38,240
Jiang Yimian, how is yours?

593
00:27:38,920 --> 00:27:39,880
I got too excited

594
00:27:39,880 --> 00:27:40,480
and forgot.

595
00:27:40,480 --> 00:27:41,560
Can we try it again?

596
00:27:42,520 --> 00:27:43,640
Once is enough for me.

597
00:27:43,640 --> 00:27:44,400
No, not again!

598
00:27:44,400 --> 00:27:45,600
Please, madam!

599
00:27:46,760 --> 00:27:47,440
Let's play another game.

600
00:27:49,080 --> 00:27:49,800
The roller coaster!

601
00:27:49,800 --> 00:27:50,400
Roller coaster.

602
00:27:50,400 --> 00:27:50,960
Let's go.

603
00:27:50,960 --> 00:27:51,680
No!

604
00:27:51,680 --> 00:27:52,480
I'm begging you!

605
00:27:54,440 --> 00:27:56,920
Jiang Yimian! Jiang Yimian!

606
00:28:08,720 --> 00:28:11,560
I'm done with this!

607
00:28:34,920 --> 00:28:36,160
How are the stats?

608
00:28:36,440 --> 00:28:38,080
At least the warning function works.

609
00:28:38,080 --> 00:28:39,600
It warns you when the heart rate

610
00:28:39,600 --> 00:28:40,520
is over 100.

611
00:28:40,840 --> 00:28:42,200
Each of us got three warnings today.

612
00:28:43,080 --> 00:28:44,040
Are you alright?

613
00:28:44,680 --> 00:28:45,960
I am still alive.

614
00:28:46,240 --> 00:28:47,280
But you are losing me.

615
00:28:47,800 --> 00:28:49,280
Is mine broken?

616
00:28:49,280 --> 00:28:50,440
It never gave me any warning.

617
00:28:50,440 --> 00:28:51,200
You can have it back.

618
00:28:51,440 --> 00:28:52,120
No.

619
00:28:52,120 --> 00:28:53,600
I need data for 24 hours

620
00:28:53,600 --> 00:28:54,480
for the tests.

621
00:28:54,880 --> 00:28:56,840
You want to do this for 24 hours?

622
00:28:56,840 --> 00:28:57,880
Calm down.

623
00:28:57,880 --> 00:28:59,280
The exciting part is over.

624
00:28:59,280 --> 00:29:01,040
Next, you go on with your

625
00:29:01,040 --> 00:29:02,200
everyday life.

626
00:29:04,360 --> 00:29:05,320
I think it's about to rain.

627
00:29:08,640 --> 00:29:09,200
Gao Yunlang,

628
00:29:09,200 --> 00:29:10,240
send me home.

629
00:29:10,240 --> 00:29:11,200
I'm a little lightheaded.

630
00:29:11,200 --> 00:29:11,560
Sure.

631
00:29:11,560 --> 00:29:12,320
We'll be going now.

632
00:29:12,320 --> 00:29:12,560
Sure.

633
00:29:12,560 --> 00:29:13,120
Stay safe.

634
00:29:13,120 --> 00:29:13,960
Bye.

635
00:29:13,960 --> 00:29:14,520
- Bye.
- Bye.

636
00:29:14,520 --> 00:29:15,440
You're leaving already?

637
00:29:15,440 --> 00:29:16,600
I'm not done having fun.

638
00:29:16,960 --> 00:29:17,920
You want more?

639
00:29:17,920 --> 00:29:18,680
It's already raining!

640
00:29:18,680 --> 00:29:20,040
Even the sky can't stand this torture.

641
00:29:20,320 --> 00:29:21,200
We should head home for now.

642
00:29:21,200 --> 00:29:22,680
Let's return to our normal life.

643
00:29:23,920 --> 00:29:24,520
What about you?

644
00:29:24,520 --> 00:29:25,360
We're taking a taxi.

645
00:29:25,360 --> 00:29:25,840
Okay, bye.

646
00:29:25,840 --> 00:29:27,040
- Bye.
- Bye.

647
00:29:27,040 --> 00:29:27,720
Let's go.

648
00:29:28,760 --> 00:29:29,480
What is it?

649
00:29:29,480 --> 00:29:30,720
Maybe the band is not waterproof.

650
00:29:30,720 --> 00:29:31,200
Hold it.

651
00:29:31,960 --> 00:29:33,160
You're not waterproof either.

652
00:29:38,240 --> 00:29:38,960
Let's go.

653
00:29:50,440 --> 00:29:52,160
The rain is not stopping for some time.

654
00:29:52,760 --> 00:29:54,200
I'll go ahead and look for a taxi.

655
00:30:05,120 --> 00:30:05,840
Are you alright?

656
00:30:06,200 --> 00:30:08,120
I've been a bad luck magnet lately.

657
00:30:08,120 --> 00:30:09,600
I'll get you a bad luck repellent charm.

658
00:30:09,600 --> 00:30:10,080
Wait here.

659
00:30:10,080 --> 00:30:10,920
I'll get an umbrella.

660
00:30:11,960 --> 00:30:13,160
Are you out of your mind?

661
00:30:13,160 --> 00:30:14,360
The rain is pouring down!

662
00:30:30,880 --> 00:30:32,280
Sir, pull over.

663
00:30:41,520 --> 00:30:42,360
He Qingyuan?

664
00:30:42,600 --> 00:30:43,480
What are you doing here?

665
00:30:43,480 --> 00:30:44,400
I was passing by.

666
00:30:45,000 --> 00:30:46,000
You don't have an umbrella, right?

667
00:30:46,920 --> 00:30:47,720
Take this.

668
00:30:48,040 --> 00:30:49,000
What about you?

669
00:30:49,520 --> 00:30:50,280
I'll be fine.

670
00:30:50,560 --> 00:30:51,680
The school is just up ahead.

671
00:30:53,040 --> 00:30:53,760
See you.

672
00:30:56,280 --> 00:30:57,880
Can you even see with your glasses?

673
00:31:00,480 --> 00:31:01,200
It's alright.

674
00:31:01,200 --> 00:31:02,240
I can shake the water off.

675
00:31:12,680 --> 00:31:13,280
What's wrong?

676
00:31:13,280 --> 00:31:14,280
Is the smart band short-circuiting?

677
00:31:49,160 --> 00:31:50,360
Alright, here we are.

678
00:31:50,360 --> 00:31:51,000
Go inside.

679
00:31:51,240 --> 00:31:52,480
Your shirt is all drenched.

680
00:31:53,280 --> 00:31:54,720
Change into some clean clothes
at my place.

681
00:31:54,720 --> 00:31:56,000
I'll ask my dad to get you some.

682
00:31:56,440 --> 00:31:57,160
I don't want to trouble you.

683
00:31:57,320 --> 00:31:58,600
I don't mind the wet clothes.

684
00:31:58,600 --> 00:31:59,400
See you.

685
00:32:00,640 --> 00:32:01,440
What's the hurry?

686
00:32:01,440 --> 00:32:02,680
It'll only take ten minutes.

687
00:32:02,800 --> 00:32:03,480
Let's go.

688
00:32:03,960 --> 00:32:05,320
It's almost nightfall.

689
00:32:05,480 --> 00:32:07,000
I'm going to visit Chen Mo.

690
00:32:07,160 --> 00:32:08,280
He just moved some time ago.

691
00:32:08,280 --> 00:32:09,160
I found out thanks to

692
00:32:09,160 --> 00:32:09,840
Xie Ang's blabbering.

693
00:32:09,840 --> 00:32:10,640
Something is off.

694
00:32:11,000 --> 00:32:12,280
What's off?

695
00:32:12,680 --> 00:32:14,000
You're the one acting weird.

696
00:32:14,240 --> 00:32:15,320
You're always with your buddies

697
00:32:15,320 --> 00:32:16,560
and not your girlfriend.

698
00:32:17,080 --> 00:32:18,520
But I walked you home, right?

699
00:32:19,160 --> 00:32:20,200
I don't care!

700
00:32:20,480 --> 00:32:21,880
You put your buddy before me!

701
00:32:23,200 --> 00:32:24,160
You are not him.

702
00:32:24,160 --> 00:32:25,280
He's not you.

703
00:32:25,840 --> 00:32:27,280
I can't forsake him over you.

704
00:32:28,160 --> 00:32:30,120
I didn't ask you to forsake him.

705
00:32:32,040 --> 00:32:32,640
Wait.

706
00:32:32,640 --> 00:32:34,800
You don't care about me!

707
00:32:36,040 --> 00:32:36,840
Tell me.

708
00:32:37,160 --> 00:32:39,640
Do you put him before me?

709
00:32:41,760 --> 00:32:43,000
You hesitated!

710
00:32:44,280 --> 00:32:44,840
No.

711
00:32:44,840 --> 00:32:46,160
I have to think.

712
00:32:46,160 --> 00:32:47,760
What's there to think about?

713
00:32:47,760 --> 00:32:49,520
I put you before everything!

714
00:32:51,320 --> 00:32:52,400
Alright.

715
00:32:52,400 --> 00:32:53,640
You're my top priority.

716
00:32:56,760 --> 00:32:58,480
Let's not throw a tantrum right now.

717
00:32:59,920 --> 00:33:01,160
Gao Yunlang!

718
00:33:01,640 --> 00:33:03,360
Now I am mad at you.

719
00:33:04,560 --> 00:33:05,360
Yes.

720
00:33:05,560 --> 00:33:07,600
I am throwing a tantrum.

721
00:33:07,880 --> 00:33:08,720
I gave up my image

722
00:33:08,720 --> 00:33:09,800
when I wooed you.

723
00:33:09,800 --> 00:33:11,480
I did it because I like you!

724
00:33:12,120 --> 00:33:13,200
And then what?

725
00:33:15,920 --> 00:33:16,760
I've never been happy

726
00:33:16,760 --> 00:33:18,320
in this relationship.

727
00:33:18,840 --> 00:33:20,400
I don't get it.

728
00:33:20,720 --> 00:33:22,520
Have you liked me at all?

729
00:33:26,200 --> 00:33:27,760
Do you have to think?

730
00:33:28,320 --> 00:33:29,040
No, I'm just...

731
00:33:29,040 --> 00:33:29,720
Forget it.

732
00:33:32,800 --> 00:33:33,920
Let's break up.

733
00:33:36,080 --> 00:33:36,720
Yueyue...

734
00:33:37,400 --> 00:33:37,880
Let's...

735
00:33:37,880 --> 00:33:39,480
Let's not joke about this, okay?

736
00:33:41,000 --> 00:33:42,480
Do I look like I am joking?

737
00:33:42,960 --> 00:33:44,520
Yueyue? Yueyue!

738
00:33:45,120 --> 00:33:45,920
Yueyue!

739
00:34:08,800 --> 00:34:09,400
No.

740
00:34:09,800 --> 00:34:11,120
The tunnel ahead is flooded.

741
00:34:11,120 --> 00:34:12,120
Cars can't get through.

742
00:34:12,800 --> 00:34:13,920
What now?

743
00:34:13,920 --> 00:34:14,960
We need a plan.

744
00:34:17,320 --> 00:34:18,520
Let's go somewhere

745
00:34:18,520 --> 00:34:19,800
we can spend the night.

746
00:34:23,380 --> 00:34:26,220
(Xiaozhu Homestay)

747
00:34:36,000 --> 00:34:37,040
There is only one bed.

748
00:34:37,840 --> 00:34:39,680
Maybe we should get a different room.

749
00:34:40,760 --> 00:34:42,400
The receptionist said
this is the last available.

750
00:34:45,320 --> 00:34:46,760
Okay.

751
00:34:46,760 --> 00:34:48,560
We've spent the night together before.

752
00:34:50,120 --> 00:34:51,320
Take a shower then.

753
00:34:57,160 --> 00:34:57,840
I mean,

754
00:34:57,840 --> 00:34:59,640
you're drenched.

755
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:01,280
You could catch a cold.

756
00:35:02,680 --> 00:35:03,440
Alright.

757
00:35:11,080 --> 00:35:12,800
There is no door.

758
00:35:13,560 --> 00:35:14,840
I think my body is strong enough.

759
00:35:14,840 --> 00:35:15,640
I don't need a shower.

760
00:35:15,640 --> 00:35:16,080
Well.

761
00:35:16,080 --> 00:35:17,160
I need to make a phone call.

762
00:35:17,160 --> 00:35:18,280
It could take an hour.

763
00:35:19,720 --> 00:35:21,240
I'll make it 90 minutes if I must.

764

(Xiaozhu Homestay)

765
00:36:45,200 --> 00:36:45,920
What...

766
00:36:45,920 --> 00:36:46,680
What is this about?

767
00:36:47,920 --> 00:36:49,320
I'm taking the pillow.

768
00:36:50,480 --> 00:36:52,440
Sleeping on the sofa gives me neck pain.

769
00:36:52,840 --> 00:36:53,880
I'll need a pillow.

770
00:36:55,960 --> 00:36:57,640
You can sleep on the bed.

771
00:36:59,320 --> 00:37:00,680
I mean I'll take the sofa.

772
00:37:00,680 --> 00:37:01,240
You take the bed.

773
00:37:01,240 --> 00:37:01,800
Never mind.

774
00:37:01,800 --> 00:37:02,400
Sleep here.

775
00:37:02,400 --> 00:37:03,280
I'll sleep on the sofa.

776
00:37:23,600 --> 00:37:25,200
I told you it wasn't waterproof.

777
