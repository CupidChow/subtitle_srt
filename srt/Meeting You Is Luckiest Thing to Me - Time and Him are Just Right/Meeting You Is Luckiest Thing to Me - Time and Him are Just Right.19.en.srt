Take this.

18
00:01:50,939 --> 00:01:52,219
You can have it back.

19
00:01:54,579 --> 00:01:55,579
I don't want it anymore.

20
00:02:01,659 --> 00:02:02,619
I don't want you anymore.

00:02:10,099 --> 00:02:11,219
Don't pull me.

22
00:02:11,219 --> 00:02:12,139
Lin Xi.

23
00:02:12,139 --> 00:02:13,739
Get off me.

24
00:02:13,979 --> 00:02:16,139
I said I don't want you anymore.

25
00:02:21,139 --> 00:02:23,339
I don't want you anymore.

26
00:02:30,939 --> 00:02:32,819
I said I don't want you anymore.

27
00:02:54,099 --> 00:02:54,579
Hello.

28
00:02:55,059 --> 00:02:56,059
Why is she so drunk?

29
00:02:56,979 --> 00:02:57,899
Be careful.

30
00:02:58,099 --> 00:02:58,899
Careful.

31
00:02:58,899 --> 00:02:59,499
Here.

32
00:03:00,219 --> 00:03:01,539
Please take care of her.

33
00:03:01,539 --> 00:03:02,379
Sorry to trouble you.

34
00:03:02,379 --> 00:03:03,339
It's fine.

35
00:03:03,659 --> 00:03:04,539
Thank you.

36
00:03:05,139 --> 00:03:05,819
Qin Kai.

37
00:03:07,419 --> 00:03:08,179
Careful.

38
00:03:09,939 --> 00:03:10,939
What is wrong with her?

39
00:03:11,219 --> 00:03:11,819
Was it you?

40
00:03:13,019 --> 00:03:13,659
Not me.

41
00:03:13,939 --> 00:03:14,539
It's Shen Pengyu.

42
00:03:14,979 --> 00:03:17,179
Who the hell is this guy?

43
00:03:17,179 --> 00:03:17,979
Who is he?

44
00:03:18,779 --> 00:03:20,299
An unreliable fellow

45
00:03:20,699 --> 00:03:21,379
who kept feeding her alcohol.

46
00:03:22,019 --> 00:03:22,939
How dare he!

47
00:03:24,299 --> 00:03:25,259
Where can I get him?

48
00:03:26,339 --> 00:03:27,859
It is useless even if you find him now.

49
00:03:45,059 --> 00:03:46,459
To keep him away from Lin Xi,

50
00:03:47,179 --> 00:03:48,259
we must prove how unreliable

51
00:03:48,259 --> 00:03:49,299
Shen Pengyu is.

52
00:03:49,819 --> 00:03:50,619
Why?

53
00:03:50,619 --> 00:03:51,739
Do you want to hack his device?

54
00:03:54,379 --> 00:03:55,419
Good idea.

55
00:03:56,659 --> 00:03:57,699
Let's fight fire with fire.

56
00:03:58,419 --> 00:03:59,499
Fight fire with fire?

57
00:03:59,739 --> 00:04:00,659
What does it mean?

58
00:04:08,440 --> 00:04:09,547
(New Friend, Add to Contact)

59
00:04:20,219 --> 00:04:22,779
(Hi. Who you are?)

60
00:04:23,339 --> 00:04:23,979
Here he is.

61
00:04:26,859 --> 00:04:27,659
What?

62
00:04:33,299 --> 00:04:35,259
Well, I'm your

63
00:04:36,379 --> 00:04:37,539
junior.

64
00:04:41,579 --> 00:04:44,259
I got your number from my friends.

65
00:04:44,779 --> 00:04:46,819
Finally, I got your WeChat contact.

66
00:04:47,539 --> 00:04:48,739
I was thinking

67
00:04:49,139 --> 00:04:51,659
whether an excellent guy like you

68
00:04:51,659 --> 00:04:54,699
would ice me out.

69
00:04:56,099 --> 00:04:57,299
Genius.

70
00:04:57,299 --> 00:04:58,379
This is gross.

71
00:04:58,379 --> 00:04:59,139
I almost spit out

72
00:04:59,139 --> 00:05:00,059
the noodles I ate.

73
00:05:00,699 --> 00:05:01,499
You do it, then.

74
00:05:01,499 --> 00:05:01,939
No.

75
00:05:01,939 --> 00:05:02,579
You do it.

76
00:05:02,579 --> 00:05:03,539
Keep on.

77
00:05:03,539 --> 00:05:04,219
Please continue.

78
00:05:05,259 --> 00:05:06,019
I did some research

79
00:05:06,019 --> 00:05:07,899
on his Weibo,

80
00:05:07,899 --> 00:05:10,459
examining the posts he liked
and the accounts he followed.

81
00:05:10,859 --> 00:05:12,499
I guess his ideal type is
friendly and pleasant girls.

82
00:05:13,579 --> 00:05:14,499
Hence, I try to imitate

83
00:05:14,499 --> 00:05:16,259
how girls of this kind talk.

84
00:05:17,819 --> 00:05:19,179
(Are you majoring in Finance too?)

85
00:05:20,539 --> 00:05:21,499
He took the bait.

86
00:05:21,819 --> 00:05:23,379
Seriously?

87
00:05:30,779 --> 00:05:32,339
Can you just cut right to it?

88
00:05:32,819 --> 00:05:33,819
Otherwise, I will end up either
being tortured by you

89
00:05:33,819 --> 00:05:34,899
or sickened by him.

90
00:05:35,819 --> 00:05:36,499
Sure thing.

91
00:05:36,899 --> 00:05:37,979
It is time

92
00:05:37,979 --> 00:05:38,939
to wrap this up.

93
00:05:40,259 --> 00:05:43,339
Well, I have one last question for you.

94
00:05:43,899 --> 00:05:47,619
Are you sweet on someone?

95
00:05:56,059 --> 00:05:57,539
(I think I'm sweet on)

96
00:05:57,539 --> 00:05:58,179
(the little kitten)

97
00:05:58,179 --> 00:05:59,339
(who's texting me tonight.)

98
00:06:00,099 --> 00:06:00,659
Yes!

99
00:06:01,059 --> 00:06:01,619
Give me five.

100
00:06:03,379 --> 00:06:04,499
We have waited for this

101
00:06:04,499 --> 00:06:05,579
for a long night.

102
00:06:08,059 --> 00:06:08,699
Hold on.

103
00:06:09,059 --> 00:06:10,379
The final touch.

104
00:06:12,539 --> 00:06:13,419
Thank you.

105
00:06:14,059 --> 00:06:15,339
Kiss kiss to you.

106
00:06:16,019 --> 00:06:17,179
Gosh, you are gross.

107
00:06:42,739 --> 00:06:44,379
Where is the necklace?

108
00:06:56,859 --> 00:06:57,819
Why are you here?

109
00:06:57,939 --> 00:06:58,939
I have something to show you.

110
00:06:59,579 --> 00:07:00,619
This is the screenshot of me
pretending as a junior

111
00:07:00,619 --> 00:07:02,019
to text Shen Pengyu.

112
00:07:03,979 --> 00:07:05,139
Such a great sacrifice

113
00:07:05,139 --> 00:07:06,019
talking in this tone.

114
00:07:06,659 --> 00:07:07,659
This is not the point.

115
00:07:07,659 --> 00:07:09,019
The point is that he doesn't like you.

116
00:07:10,259 --> 00:07:10,939
I know.

117
00:07:11,179 --> 00:07:12,419
No one likes me.

118
00:07:13,059 --> 00:07:13,579
Wait.

119
00:07:13,899 --> 00:07:15,179
I just want to remind you

120
00:07:15,179 --> 00:07:16,139
to stay away from him.

121
00:07:16,139 --> 00:07:17,339
He isn't a good guy.

122
00:07:17,339 --> 00:07:18,299
It's my business

123
00:07:18,579 --> 00:07:19,779
and it doesn't concern you.

124
00:07:20,179 --> 00:07:21,699
I don't pry into your life.

125
00:07:21,699 --> 00:07:23,099
Please don't pry into mine as well.

126
00:07:33,019 --> 00:07:34,579
Please hear me out.

127
00:07:34,579 --> 00:07:35,619
You are too naive

128
00:07:35,619 --> 00:07:37,219
to trust a sanctimonious fellow
like Shen Pengyu

129
00:07:37,459 --> 00:07:38,939
as you are just new here

130
00:07:38,939 --> 00:07:40,299
and don't know much about socializing.

131
00:07:40,299 --> 00:07:41,099
Oh.

132
00:07:41,139 --> 00:07:41,939
Is that so?

133
00:07:43,739 --> 00:07:44,819
Good morning, senior.

134
00:07:44,819 --> 00:07:45,779
Lin Xi.

135
00:07:45,779 --> 00:07:46,539
What a coincidence.

136
00:07:46,539 --> 00:07:47,739
Am I allowed to attend
the class I asked you

137
00:07:47,739 --> 00:07:48,659
before?

138
00:07:48,659 --> 00:07:49,379
No worries.

139
00:07:49,379 --> 00:07:50,819
I have told my lecturer.

140
00:07:50,819 --> 00:07:51,939
You can attend the lecture.

141
00:07:52,339 --> 00:07:52,899
Really?

142
00:07:52,899 --> 00:07:53,739
Thank you so much.

143
00:07:53,739 --> 00:07:54,459
Don't mention it.

144
00:07:54,459 --> 00:07:55,539
I will get going.

145
00:07:55,859 --> 00:07:56,419
See you.

146
00:07:56,419 --> 00:07:57,259
- See you.
- See you.

147
00:07:59,459 --> 00:08:00,259
Lin Xi.

148
00:08:00,259 --> 00:08:01,979
The clinical class is having an event
this weekend.

149
00:08:01,979 --> 00:08:02,419
Do you want to join us?

150
00:08:02,419 --> 00:08:02,899
Sure thing.

151
00:08:02,899 --> 00:08:03,579
What time is it?

152
00:08:03,579 --> 00:08:04,379
Saturday night at eight.

153
00:08:04,379 --> 00:08:05,259
Building 2 Room 403.

154
00:08:05,259 --> 00:08:05,859
See you there.

155
00:08:05,859 --> 00:08:06,699
Sure, I will be there.

156
00:08:06,699 --> 00:08:07,419
Good. Bye.

157
00:08:07,419 --> 00:08:08,059
Bye.

158
00:08:10,219 --> 00:08:11,499
You know a lot of people.

159
00:08:12,019 --> 00:08:12,979
I'm a people person.

160
00:08:28,379 --> 00:08:29,699
You came to the wrong hall.

161
00:08:30,019 --> 00:08:30,859
Your lecture

162
00:08:30,859 --> 00:08:31,939
is in the next hall on the right.

163
00:08:32,259 --> 00:08:33,099
I'm in the right hall.

164
00:08:33,419 --> 00:08:34,499
I came here for the lecture.

165
00:08:34,939 --> 00:08:35,579
Don't lie to me.

166
00:08:36,059 --> 00:08:36,899
You want to dissuade me

167
00:08:36,899 --> 00:08:37,939
not to befriend Shen Pengyu, right?

168
00:08:38,619 --> 00:08:39,739
Bad guess.

169
00:08:40,499 --> 00:08:43,579
I came here
for the anthropotomy lecture.

170
00:08:44,619 --> 00:08:45,299
Are you sure?

171
00:08:45,619 --> 00:08:46,339
Yes.

172
00:08:46,779 --> 00:08:47,819
Also, I want to widen my social circle

173
00:08:48,099 --> 00:08:49,579
like you do.

174
00:08:53,379 --> 00:08:54,099
Good.

175
00:08:54,099 --> 00:08:55,379
Widen your social circle?

176
00:08:55,899 --> 00:08:57,179
I will give you a hand then.

177
00:09:08,339 --> 00:09:09,059
Students.

178
00:09:09,059 --> 00:09:10,160
Let's get started.

179
00:09:10,160 --> 00:09:11,119
(Anthropotomy)

180
00:09:11,179 --> 00:09:11,819
Today,

181
00:09:11,819 --> 00:09:13,200
we will learn the new chapter.

182
00:09:13,200 --> 00:09:14,360
(Anthropotomy: Muscles and Bones)

183
00:09:14,360 --> 00:09:15,819
Muscles and bones.

184
00:09:16,659 --> 00:09:17,299
Well.

185
00:09:17,299 --> 00:09:18,499
As you know,

186
00:09:18,819 --> 00:09:19,619
today,

187
00:09:19,619 --> 00:09:20,859
I need a model

188
00:09:20,859 --> 00:09:21,779
onstage

189
00:09:22,179 --> 00:09:23,579
to work with me on the explanation.

190
00:09:24,259 --> 00:09:26,659
Anyone volunteer to come on stage?

191
00:09:29,539 --> 00:09:30,779
Any volunteer?

192
00:09:36,299 --> 00:09:37,419
Model?

193
00:09:38,219 --> 00:09:39,659
Why does everyone lower their heads?

194
00:09:40,219 --> 00:09:41,339
Are you curious about it?

195
00:09:42,939 --> 00:09:43,699
Sir.

196
00:09:43,979 --> 00:09:45,259
My friend next to me can come on stage.

197
00:09:46,459 --> 00:09:48,099
Finally, someone volunteered today.

198
00:09:48,619 --> 00:09:49,179
Very good.

199
00:09:49,179 --> 00:09:49,739
Come on.

200
00:09:49,739 --> 00:09:50,499
Proceed forward.

201
00:09:50,499 --> 00:09:51,739
Come on.

202
00:09:54,699 --> 00:09:56,419
It must be something bad.

203
00:09:57,179 --> 00:09:58,939
Didn't you want to widen
your social circle?

204
00:10:00,179 --> 00:10:00,859
Go ahead.

205
00:10:00,859 --> 00:10:02,259
Everyone is getting impatient.

206
00:10:13,059 --> 00:10:13,619
Sir.

207
00:10:13,619 --> 00:10:15,619
How may I help you?

208
00:10:17,499 --> 00:10:18,019
Not bad.

209
00:10:19,819 --> 00:10:20,339
Take it off.

210
00:10:21,299 --> 00:10:21,939
Pardon?

211
00:10:24,699 --> 00:10:25,379
Take it off.

212
00:10:27,779 --> 00:10:29,019
Well, look at it here.

213
00:10:29,979 --> 00:10:32,379
This is the deltoid muscle
and splenius cervicis muscle.

214
00:10:33,139 --> 00:10:34,379
As for levator scapulae,

215
00:10:34,619 --> 00:10:36,299
it is the neck muscle
which carries the most weight.

216
00:10:37,179 --> 00:10:38,099
Relax your body.

217
00:10:39,219 --> 00:10:40,059
Take note of this.

218
00:10:40,579 --> 00:10:42,739
If the levator scapula is overloaded,

219
00:10:42,939 --> 00:10:44,499
its flexibility is reduced,

220
00:10:45,059 --> 00:10:46,219
leading to shrugging.

221
00:10:46,859 --> 00:10:47,939
Let me show you this.

222
00:10:48,339 --> 00:10:50,219
His hip-to-shoulder ratio

223
00:10:50,579 --> 00:10:51,379
is pretty perfect.

224
00:10:52,539 --> 00:10:53,299
He has an inverted triangle
body shape.

225
00:10:53,899 --> 00:10:54,579
Exactly.

226
00:10:54,579 --> 00:10:55,779
He has an inverted triangle.

227
00:10:56,099 --> 00:10:57,579
Please turn around.

228
00:10:57,579 --> 00:10:59,179
We will look at the muscle
of the front part.

229
00:11:05,859 --> 00:11:07,899
Eight-packs.

230
00:11:08,579 --> 00:11:10,139
You seem to be having much interest

231
00:11:10,139 --> 00:11:11,059
in his abs.

232
00:11:11,659 --> 00:11:12,899
Well, let me pose a question.

233
00:11:14,099 --> 00:11:15,299
That's you.

234
00:11:15,659 --> 00:11:16,739
The one who sits next to this model.

235
00:11:17,139 --> 00:11:17,539
Stand up.

236
00:11:17,539 --> 00:11:18,299
Answer my question.

237
00:11:19,099 --> 00:11:19,859
Tell me

238
00:11:20,059 --> 00:11:21,259
what are these

239
00:11:21,499 --> 00:11:23,419
eight-packs?

240
00:11:25,379 --> 00:11:26,339
Rectus abdominis.

241
00:11:26,579 --> 00:11:27,819
Aside from this,

242
00:11:27,819 --> 00:11:29,939
there are transverse abdominis...

243
00:11:31,859 --> 00:11:35,259
The internal and external
oblique abdominis.

244
00:11:35,659 --> 00:11:36,779
Correct.

245
00:11:37,259 --> 00:11:38,339
Well, let's check the names.

246
00:11:38,939 --> 00:11:40,339
Today's lecture carries out very well,

247
00:11:40,739 --> 00:11:43,179
thanks to the model.

248
00:11:43,859 --> 00:11:44,259
Come on.

249
00:11:44,259 --> 00:11:45,379
Let's give him a big round of applause.

250
00:11:45,379 --> 00:11:45,899
Well done.

251
00:11:50,779 --> 00:11:51,539
Sir.

252
00:11:52,459 --> 00:11:53,979
When will my part be done?

253
00:11:54,499 --> 00:11:55,379
Be patient.

254
00:11:55,939 --> 00:11:56,939
We just started

255
00:11:56,939 --> 00:11:58,499
with the superficial muscles.

256
00:11:58,499 --> 00:11:59,459
Next,

257
00:11:59,459 --> 00:12:00,699
we are going to learn about the bones.

258
00:12:02,019 --> 00:12:02,659
Students.

259
00:12:02,979 --> 00:12:05,659
let's revise the muscles
on the front part

260
00:12:05,659 --> 00:12:06,579
as well as the rear part

261
00:12:06,579 --> 00:12:07,379
we've learnt just now.

262
00:12:07,379 --> 00:12:08,859
Do you remember them well?

263
00:12:09,419 --> 00:12:10,259
If not,

264
00:12:10,259 --> 00:12:12,019
raise any questions if you want.

265
00:12:13,739 --> 00:12:14,579
Well, let's revise it again.

266
00:12:14,579 --> 00:12:15,739
Shall we?

267
00:12:20,619 --> 00:12:21,539
Delete the picture.

268
00:12:21,779 --> 00:12:23,059
Why would I delete my lecture note?

269
00:12:23,739 --> 00:12:24,939
That is my privacy.

270
00:12:24,939 --> 00:12:25,819
Privacy, my foot.

271
00:12:25,819 --> 00:12:26,779
We should treat it seriously.

272
00:12:26,779 --> 00:12:28,379
This is the human muscle system diagram.

273
00:12:28,379 --> 00:12:29,179
It is my lecture note.

274
00:12:29,579 --> 00:12:31,139
If you are using it as your screen lock,

275
00:12:31,139 --> 00:12:32,259
I won't stop you.

276
00:12:52,899 --> 00:12:53,579
Are you going to tell me that

277
00:12:53,579 --> 00:12:54,859
you share it as the lecture note?

278
00:12:55,259 --> 00:12:55,979
Oops.

279
00:12:56,379 --> 00:12:57,859
I was going to set it as my screen lock,
though.

280
00:12:57,859 --> 00:12:58,779
I made a mistake somehow.

281
00:13:01,179 --> 00:13:01,859
(Xing.)

282
00:13:01,939 --> 00:13:03,219
(You worked out a lot, huh?)

283
00:13:03,259 --> 00:13:04,699
(You actually have washboard abs.)

284
00:13:05,699 --> 00:13:07,219
(Did you attend the lecture
with Lin Xi?)

285
00:13:07,419 --> 00:13:08,939
(What's going on now, Lin Xi?)

286
00:13:09,459 --> 00:13:10,619
(You have patched things up?)

287
00:13:10,979 --> 00:13:12,019
(Are you thick?)

288
00:13:12,379 --> 00:13:13,939
(Someone is wooing back his girl.)

289
00:13:14,539 --> 00:13:16,699
They said I'm wooing my girl.

290
00:13:17,859 --> 00:13:18,899
Nonsense.

291
00:13:19,299 --> 00:13:20,419
They are delusional.

292
00:13:21,699 --> 00:13:22,579
Ji Junxing.

293
00:13:24,219 --> 00:13:25,019
Why do you come here?

294
00:13:25,019 --> 00:13:25,939
I have been looking for you.

295
00:13:26,339 --> 00:13:27,139
Excuse me.

296
00:13:27,139 --> 00:13:27,979
I need to talk to him now.

297
00:13:28,259 --> 00:13:28,739
Come with me.

298
00:13:28,739 --> 00:13:29,419
Lin Xi.

299
00:13:29,419 --> 00:13:29,899
Wait for me here.

300
00:13:29,899 --> 00:13:30,499
We will leave together.

301
00:13:34,539 --> 00:13:35,979
Why should I wait up?

302
00:13:42,619 --> 00:13:43,459
Well, then.

303
00:13:49,099 --> 00:13:50,939
This is very important to me.

304
00:13:51,339 --> 00:13:52,219
I'm so nervous now.

305
00:13:52,219 --> 00:13:53,939
What if something happens later?

306
00:13:54,619 --> 00:13:56,259
I will help you go through it again
tonight.

307
00:13:56,739 --> 00:13:57,419
Will you?

308
00:13:58,019 --> 00:13:59,219
My happiness

309
00:13:59,539 --> 00:14:00,939
depends on you, then.

310
00:14:00,939 --> 00:14:01,659
No worries.

311
00:14:01,659 --> 00:14:02,379
You can trust me.

312
00:14:03,739 --> 00:14:04,579
What am I doing here?

313
00:14:04,899 --> 00:14:06,619
I need to practice again.

314
00:14:06,619 --> 00:14:07,659
Don't miss it.

315
00:14:08,579 --> 00:14:09,259
Sure thing.

316
00:14:09,259 --> 00:14:10,099
I will be there.

317
00:14:10,099 --> 00:14:10,579
Good.

318
00:14:24,059 --> 00:14:24,899
Is this going to work out?

319
00:14:24,899 --> 00:14:26,139
It sure does.

320
00:14:26,139 --> 00:14:27,579
Have I lied to you before?

321
00:14:27,579 --> 00:14:28,819
I'm counting on you, then.

322
00:14:29,579 --> 00:14:31,379
Pengyu, let's grab a drink
at the coffee shop nearby.

323
00:14:31,899 --> 00:14:32,779
Well.

324
00:14:32,779 --> 00:14:34,579
I think I can fulfill your request.

325
00:14:42,339 --> 00:14:43,139
Well.

326
00:14:44,459 --> 00:14:45,299
Is this okay?

327
00:14:45,539 --> 00:14:46,019
Good.

328
00:14:46,619 --> 00:14:48,219
She ignores my advice.

329
00:14:53,299 --> 00:14:54,219
Can you really do it?

330
00:14:54,899 --> 00:14:55,299
Of course,

331
00:14:55,299 --> 00:14:56,019
I will help you.

332
00:14:56,579 --> 00:14:57,779
I shall thank you in advance.

333
00:14:58,099 --> 00:14:59,299
The coffee is on me.

334
00:14:59,779 --> 00:15:01,139
If so,

335
00:15:01,139 --> 00:15:02,179
buy me one too.

336
00:15:02,979 --> 00:15:03,939
Do you mind if I sit here?

337
00:15:04,139 --> 00:15:05,219
Yes.

338
00:15:05,779 --> 00:15:06,499
Glad that you don't.

339
00:15:11,499 --> 00:15:12,339
Take order, please.

340
00:15:12,339 --> 00:15:13,179
Coming.

341
00:15:17,419 --> 00:15:19,059
I would like to have a cup of green tea.

342
00:15:20,219 --> 00:15:20,859
I'm sorry.

343
00:15:20,859 --> 00:15:22,739
We only serve coffee here.

344
00:15:23,779 --> 00:15:25,659
I would have a cup of green tea latte,
then.

345
00:15:25,899 --> 00:15:27,979
I'm just fine with any drinks
that come with tea.

346
00:15:28,419 --> 00:15:29,859
Sure, coming right up.

347
00:15:32,139 --> 00:15:33,459
Your friend seems to disapprove of me.

348
00:15:34,579 --> 00:15:35,739
He just picks at everyone.

349
00:15:36,059 --> 00:15:37,419
Do you happen to pass by here?

350
00:15:37,819 --> 00:15:38,579
No.

351
00:15:38,579 --> 00:15:39,899
I go out of my way
to grab a drink here.

352
00:15:40,379 --> 00:15:41,219
I was chatting with someone

353
00:15:41,219 --> 00:15:43,219
and I couldn't sleep well
yesterday night.

354
00:15:43,219 --> 00:15:44,979
I need a caffeine bump.

355
00:15:47,739 --> 00:15:48,979
Table 13, please pick up your order.

356
00:15:52,019 --> 00:15:52,459
Pengyu.

357
00:15:52,459 --> 00:15:53,499
I will go picking up.

358
00:15:53,499 --> 00:15:53,979
Go ahead.

359
00:15:54,859 --> 00:15:56,459
If so, please wait there

360
00:15:56,659 --> 00:15:57,699
for my order too.

361
00:16:05,619 --> 00:16:06,779
You have got panda eyes.

362
00:16:07,179 --> 00:16:08,539
Had a bad night, huh?

363
00:16:09,259 --> 00:16:10,139
Lin Xi is away now.

364
00:16:10,419 --> 00:16:11,579
Don't beat around the bush.

365
00:16:12,339 --> 00:16:13,819
Do you find me

366
00:16:14,379 --> 00:16:15,299
familiar?

367
00:16:15,659 --> 00:16:16,219
Nonsense.

368
00:16:16,219 --> 00:16:17,179
I just met you yesterday.

369
00:16:18,099 --> 00:16:18,699
No.

370
00:16:19,059 --> 00:16:19,619
It is today.

371
00:16:20,019 --> 00:16:21,019
This midnight.

372
00:16:21,659 --> 00:16:22,539
What the heck are you saying?

373
00:16:22,539 --> 00:16:23,499
I was in my dorm this midnight.

374
00:16:23,739 --> 00:16:24,699
Can't you remember that?

375
00:16:25,659 --> 00:16:26,979
Let me refresh your memory.

376
00:16:27,899 --> 00:16:28,939
Yesterday late at night,

377
00:16:29,779 --> 00:16:32,099
you were calling my little kitten

378
00:16:34,779 --> 00:16:35,539
and little fairy.

379
00:16:37,659 --> 00:16:40,499
You said you were so happy
chatting with me last night.

380
00:16:41,339 --> 00:16:43,139
You are getting over me so fast.

381
00:16:46,299 --> 00:16:47,099
You tricked me?

382
00:16:48,779 --> 00:16:49,739
I warn you.

383
00:16:50,219 --> 00:16:51,459
Don't get any ideas
about targeting her.

384
00:16:52,019 --> 00:16:54,379
Otherwise, the conversation between you
and the little kitten

385
00:16:54,619 --> 00:16:55,899
will be spread around campus.

386
00:17:12,619 --> 00:17:13,579
Where is he?

387
00:17:13,859 --> 00:17:14,379
He left.

388
00:17:15,379 --> 00:17:16,379
He left?

389
00:17:17,659 --> 00:17:19,019
I haven't paid him the pay yet.

390
00:17:19,539 --> 00:17:20,659
Why do you pay him money?

391
00:17:23,059 --> 00:17:23,779
Driving academy?

392
00:17:24,219 --> 00:17:24,899
So, you asked him out

393
00:17:24,899 --> 00:17:26,179
to talk about the enrollment
of the driving academy?

394
00:17:26,179 --> 00:17:26,859
Or what?

395
00:17:27,499 --> 00:17:28,219
They are many driving academies
out there.

396
00:17:28,219 --> 00:17:29,499
Why ask him?

397
00:17:30,059 --> 00:17:30,979
He can give me thirty percent off.

398
00:17:30,979 --> 00:17:31,579
Can you?

399
00:17:31,579 --> 00:17:32,739
I give you forty percent off.

400
00:17:32,739 --> 00:17:33,379
Give me the money.

401
00:17:33,379 --> 00:17:34,059
I will register for the course for you.

402
00:17:34,059 --> 00:17:35,659
Why don't you pay for my course?

403
00:17:35,939 --> 00:17:36,619
Sure.

404
00:17:37,379 --> 00:17:38,299
Are you serious?

405
00:17:38,739 --> 00:17:39,619
What has it got to do with you

406
00:17:39,619 --> 00:17:40,299
when I register for a driving course

407
00:17:40,299 --> 00:17:41,379
or talk to someone?

408
00:17:41,659 --> 00:17:42,219
When have you become

409
00:17:42,219 --> 00:17:43,379
so busybody?

410
00:17:43,379 --> 00:17:45,259
I'm worried that you would trust
that darned Shen Pengyu.

411
00:17:45,259 --> 00:17:46,659
He's not a good guy.

412
00:17:46,659 --> 00:17:47,899
Shen Pengyu approaches

413
00:17:47,899 --> 00:17:48,939
so many girls out there.

414
00:17:48,939 --> 00:17:49,739
Why do you only pry into my affairs

415
00:17:49,739 --> 00:17:50,659
instead of others'?

416
00:17:50,659 --> 00:17:52,099
Because you are different from them.

417
00:17:57,659 --> 00:17:58,299
Different?

418
00:17:58,979 --> 00:17:59,859
What is the difference between us?

419
00:18:00,979 --> 00:18:02,459
You made promises to anyone you met.

420
00:18:03,859 --> 00:18:04,579
Lin Xi.

421
00:18:05,339 --> 00:18:07,059
You are wrong about me, aren't you?

422
00:18:07,819 --> 00:18:08,579
You know this well...

423
00:18:15,539 --> 00:18:16,419
(Xing.)

424
00:18:16,699 --> 00:18:18,339
(Bid a farewell to the world
on my behalf.)

425
00:18:18,339 --> 00:18:19,019
What?

426
00:18:19,539 --> 00:18:20,059
Mianmian.

427
00:18:20,059 --> 00:18:20,779
What's wrong?

428
00:18:21,339 --> 00:18:22,019
(Lin Xi,)

429
00:18:22,299 --> 00:18:24,019
(do I commit a crime)

430
00:18:24,019 --> 00:18:24,899
(if I cripple Xie Ang?)

431
00:18:36,619 --> 00:18:37,419
You know what.

432
00:18:37,699 --> 00:18:39,139
We went to see a suspense movie

433
00:18:39,139 --> 00:18:40,139
and he just revealed

434
00:18:40,139 --> 00:18:41,459
the identity of the murderer

435
00:18:41,699 --> 00:18:42,899
three minutes after the movie started.

436
00:18:42,899 --> 00:18:44,139
He nipped my anticipation for the movie

437
00:18:44,139 --> 00:18:44,979
from the beginning.

438
00:18:47,939 --> 00:18:48,659
When we were watching the movie,

439
00:18:48,659 --> 00:18:49,659
she asked so many questions

440
00:18:50,339 --> 00:18:51,979
like "who's the good guy?",
"who's the bad guy?",

441
00:18:51,979 --> 00:18:53,379
and "is this the antagonist?".

442
00:18:53,579 --> 00:18:54,339
Hence, I told her.

443
00:18:54,339 --> 00:18:55,379
Yet, she blamed me.

444
00:18:55,379 --> 00:18:56,219
Because of such trivial things,

445
00:18:56,219 --> 00:18:57,019
she was telling me off from the cinema

446
00:18:57,019 --> 00:18:57,459
till we reached the dorm.

447
00:18:57,459 --> 00:18:58,019
She kept fighting with me
since yesterday night

448
00:18:58,019 --> 00:18:59,179
till today's 3:00 a.m.

449
00:18:59,179 --> 00:19:00,019
This is never going to end.

450
00:19:00,379 --> 00:19:01,379
No one can stand her for sure.

451
00:19:01,379 --> 00:19:01,859
No.

452
00:19:02,139 --> 00:19:03,059
I have decided on this.

453
00:19:03,059 --> 00:19:04,419
I want to break up with him

454
00:19:04,419 --> 00:19:05,459
to return myself to peace.

455
00:19:06,699 --> 00:19:08,179
Are you serious?

456
00:19:08,179 --> 00:19:09,739
You just get back together yesterday.

457
00:19:10,219 --> 00:19:12,219
Well, you may not
watch suspense movies then.

458
00:19:12,219 --> 00:19:13,059
You can watch another genre,

459
00:19:13,059 --> 00:19:13,739
like romance.

460
00:19:15,699 --> 00:19:17,179
Is it the movie I need to change?

461
00:19:17,739 --> 00:19:18,339
No.

462
00:19:18,339 --> 00:19:19,819
It's the boyfriend instead.

463
00:19:20,419 --> 00:19:21,299
Are you sure

464
00:19:21,579 --> 00:19:22,299
to break up with her?

465
00:19:22,659 --> 00:19:23,499
Yes, I'm certain of it.

466
00:19:25,219 --> 00:19:26,539
I remember last time you said

467
00:19:26,539 --> 00:19:28,099
you're a fool
if you still stayed with her.

468
00:19:28,099 --> 00:19:29,179
The time before, you said

469
00:19:29,179 --> 00:19:30,419
you would change your surname
if you didn't break up with her.

470
00:19:31,179 --> 00:19:31,939
Congrats.

471
00:19:31,939 --> 00:19:34,219
Now you are a fool without a surname.

472
00:19:34,859 --> 00:19:35,979
Look, after dating her,

473
00:19:36,579 --> 00:19:37,659
I have lost my dignity as a human.

474
00:19:38,299 --> 00:19:38,779
No way.

475
00:19:39,299 --> 00:19:40,619
I can't let this go even worse.

476
00:19:42,739 --> 00:19:43,819
Don't doubt me.

477
00:19:43,819 --> 00:19:44,699
I will show you my determination.

478
00:19:55,139 --> 00:19:55,779
Look.

479
00:19:56,659 --> 00:19:57,219
Look at this.

480
00:19:57,219 --> 00:19:58,179
He calls for reconciliation again.

481
00:19:58,179 --> 00:19:59,059
Answer it.

482
00:20:02,259 --> 00:20:02,699
Hello.

483
00:20:02,899 --> 00:20:03,579
What's the matter?

484
00:20:03,579 --> 00:20:04,539
Seeking reconciliation again?

485
00:20:04,779 --> 00:20:05,739
I'm telling you,

486
00:20:05,739 --> 00:20:07,659
I won't accept you again.

487
00:20:08,059 --> 00:20:09,179
Reconciliation, my foot.

488
00:20:09,579 --> 00:20:10,219
Listen, Jiang Yimian.

489
00:20:10,739 --> 00:20:12,979
Let's make an end here.

490
00:20:14,379 --> 00:20:15,299
Wow, Xie Ang.

491
00:20:15,299 --> 00:20:16,459
Well done.

492
00:20:16,459 --> 00:20:17,339
Make an end?

493
00:20:17,339 --> 00:20:18,379
Just break up.

494
00:20:18,739 --> 00:20:19,699
Tonight at eight,

495
00:20:19,699 --> 00:20:20,979
let's meet up for the breakup.

496
00:20:20,979 --> 00:20:21,979
See you there.

497
00:20:21,979 --> 00:20:22,979
You won't see me there.

498
00:20:27,339 --> 00:20:28,499
How dare he hang up on me!

499
00:20:32,259 --> 00:20:33,299
I'm storming out.

500
00:20:44,419 --> 00:20:45,419
Why is it you?

501
00:20:45,699 --> 00:20:46,259
Where is Xie Ang?

502
00:20:46,579 --> 00:20:47,619
He's sick.

503
00:20:47,619 --> 00:20:49,179
He wants me to relay his message.

504
00:20:49,179 --> 00:20:50,499
Good, that's what I'm here for.

505
00:20:50,859 --> 00:20:52,179
Since we're here to relay the message,

506
00:20:52,179 --> 00:20:53,459
let's cut to the chase

507
00:20:53,459 --> 00:20:54,779
and not waste our time here.

508
00:20:59,339 --> 00:21:00,819
O, holding the pathetic pastry
and wine in hand.

509
00:21:00,819 --> 00:21:02,259
How I suffer tonight.

510
00:21:02,499 --> 00:21:03,619
You heartless and hypocritical fellow,

511
00:21:03,619 --> 00:21:04,299
worse than any womanizer

512
00:21:04,299 --> 00:21:05,019
and heartbreaker.

513
00:21:05,019 --> 00:21:05,979
You darned jerk!

514
00:21:06,699 --> 00:21:07,979
O, why would I torture myself
at such a young age.

515
00:21:07,979 --> 00:21:09,459
How free if I am single again.

516
00:21:09,459 --> 00:21:10,619
We should break up and
don't you pester anymore.

517
00:21:10,619 --> 00:21:11,539
Getting rid of jerks

518
00:21:11,539 --> 00:21:12,259
when love fades.

519
00:21:12,259 --> 00:21:13,099
Bugger off!

520
00:21:14,339 --> 00:21:15,739
Well written, huh?

521
00:21:16,499 --> 00:21:17,219
What's yours?

522
00:21:19,779 --> 00:21:21,539
Though you are my dearest Mianmian

523
00:21:21,539 --> 00:21:23,019
and I'm your precious Ang,

524
00:21:23,019 --> 00:21:24,459
we promised to stay together lovingly

525
00:21:24,459 --> 00:21:25,899
till our last breath.

526
00:21:26,379 --> 00:21:27,579
Sadly, within

527
00:21:27,579 --> 00:21:28,939
258 days,

528
00:21:28,939 --> 00:21:30,539
12 hours 56 minutes,

529
00:21:30,539 --> 00:21:33,179
we have broken up 223 times already.

530
00:21:33,659 --> 00:21:34,899
But ask yourself.

531
00:21:34,899 --> 00:21:36,339
Was it all my fault?

532
00:21:36,699 --> 00:21:37,779
The first time when...

533
00:21:40,659 --> 00:21:41,979
Did he start the story

534
00:21:41,979 --> 00:21:43,179
since the earth exists?

535
00:21:44,339 --> 00:21:45,379
Read it yourself.

536
00:21:45,379 --> 00:21:46,179
No.

537
00:21:46,659 --> 00:21:47,419
Too many words.

538
00:21:48,539 --> 00:21:49,539
Conclude it.

539
00:21:50,499 --> 00:21:51,019
Fine.

540
00:21:52,179 --> 00:21:54,219
Xie Ang thinks Jiang Yimian is fickle

541
00:21:54,539 --> 00:21:55,619
and has been

542
00:21:55,619 --> 00:21:56,619
mercurial.

543
00:21:56,979 --> 00:21:58,179
She always brings up breakups,

544
00:21:58,179 --> 00:21:59,459
gives him a cold shoulder
and goes missing.

545
00:22:00,099 --> 00:22:01,539
In a love relationship,
one needs to respond to the partner.

546
00:22:02,059 --> 00:22:03,499
It can't just depend on one

547
00:22:04,059 --> 00:22:05,859
to contribute and give in.

548
00:22:06,259 --> 00:22:07,259
People will be sick of it
in the end.

549
00:22:11,139 --> 00:22:12,739
Boys always accuse girls

550
00:22:12,739 --> 00:22:13,619
of throwing tantrums.

551
00:22:13,859 --> 00:22:14,659
Why don't you reflect on yourselves

552
00:22:14,659 --> 00:22:15,779
when you are flip-flopping

553
00:22:15,779 --> 00:22:17,019
and reneging your words?

554
00:22:17,739 --> 00:22:18,379
Is it possible

555
00:22:18,379 --> 00:22:19,819
that you don't learn the truth

556
00:22:19,819 --> 00:22:21,019
but make your own groundless guess?

557
00:22:22,299 --> 00:22:23,099
Ji Junxing.

558
00:22:23,619 --> 00:22:25,219
Are you really relaying
Xie Ang's message

559
00:22:25,219 --> 00:22:26,819
or are you being sarcastic to me?

560
00:22:28,179 --> 00:22:29,539
I just said things
that come to my mind.

561
00:22:29,539 --> 00:22:30,659
Don't take it personally.

562
00:22:34,819 --> 00:22:35,459
Fine.

563
00:22:35,859 --> 00:22:36,579
Listen.

564
00:22:36,859 --> 00:22:38,459
No one would make groundless guess

565
00:22:38,459 --> 00:22:39,179
out of nothing.

566
00:22:39,539 --> 00:22:40,859
You should reflect on yourselves.

567
00:22:41,259 --> 00:22:42,019
That's all.

568
00:22:42,019 --> 00:22:42,739
Bye.

569
00:22:57,019 --> 00:22:57,739
How was it?

570
00:22:57,739 --> 00:22:58,339
Did my long letter

571
00:22:58,339 --> 00:22:59,099
scare her?

572
00:22:59,419 --> 00:23:00,619
No, it scared me.

573
00:23:00,619 --> 00:23:02,539
You should've studied literature.

574
00:23:02,539 --> 00:23:03,539
What about me

575
00:23:03,539 --> 00:23:04,739
and Jiang Yimian?

576
00:23:05,179 --> 00:23:06,539
Did we really break up?

577
00:23:06,899 --> 00:23:08,539
Do you want to break up with her or not?

578
00:23:09,979 --> 00:23:10,899
How was it?

579
00:23:11,339 --> 00:23:12,259
What was the situation there?

580
00:23:12,539 --> 00:23:13,179
Angry arguments were thrown at
each other

581
00:23:13,179 --> 00:23:13,779
fiercely

582
00:23:13,779 --> 00:23:14,939
and vigorously.

583
00:23:14,939 --> 00:23:15,739
What's the result?

584
00:23:16,339 --> 00:23:17,939
Ji Junxing and I parted ways
on bad terms.

585
00:23:18,299 --> 00:23:20,259
I'm asking about me and Xie Ang.

586
00:23:22,499 --> 00:23:23,259
Perhaps...

587
00:23:23,259 --> 00:23:24,059
I guess...

588
00:23:24,699 --> 00:23:26,379
Maybe your relationship has ended.

589
00:23:26,619 --> 00:23:27,299
Why does it sound

590
00:23:27,299 --> 00:23:28,619
so uncertain?

591
00:23:28,619 --> 00:23:29,659
I want an absolute, determined

592
00:23:29,659 --> 00:23:30,899
and exact answer.

593
00:23:30,899 --> 00:23:32,259
I don't know if your relationship
has ended.

594
00:23:32,259 --> 00:23:33,979
But Lin Xi and I are almost finished
because of you.

595
00:23:34,619 --> 00:23:35,419
Leave my room now.

596
00:23:35,419 --> 00:23:35,939
What do you mean?

597
00:23:35,939 --> 00:23:36,619
Hey.

598
00:23:37,019 --> 00:23:37,859
Why do you blame me?

599
00:23:59,160 --> 00:23:59,960
(Lin Xi)

600
00:24:06,139 --> 00:24:06,899

613

Do the stretching with me.

614
00:25:07,379 --> 00:25:07,659
Ready.

615
00:25:07,659 --> 00:25:08,379
Stretch.

Yes, coach.

618
00:25:57,259 --> 00:25:59,019
Any news about the national competition?

619
00:25:59,539 --> 00:26:01,179
You are the first one
who made a better record

let me discuss with other coaches.

623

Thank you, coach.

624
00:26:07,299 --> 00:26:08,899
I can do better.

625
00:26:09,499 --> 00:26:10,259
Don't strain your leg.

626
00:26:10,499 --> 00:26:11,459
Wait for my news.

627
00:26:15,139 --> 00:26:16,059
Thank you, coach.

Why are you here?

634
00:26:45,979 --> 00:26:46,499
I came to the driving academy

635
00:26:46,499 --> 00:26:47,819
for driving course.

636
00:26:49,219 --> 00:26:49,699

Shen Pengyu got me this place.

640
00:26:54,459 --> 00:26:56,099
Thirty-two percent for a duo package.

641
00:26:56,339 --> 00:26:57,419
Mine is cheaper.

642

I signed this up yesterday too.

That's right.

647
00:27:07,419 --> 00:27:08,459
You even took advantage.

What should I do first?

654
00:27:29,939 --> 00:27:30,859
Adjust your seat.

How? To what extent?

656
00:27:36,979 --> 00:27:38,819
Adjust the seat
to your comfortable position.

00:29:36,819 --> 00:29:37,379
Get down.

694
00:29:38,979 --> 00:29:39,619
What's up?

695
00:29:46,659 --> 00:29:48,059
Are you here to learn to drive
or to coach me?

696
00:29:48,419 --> 00:29:50,179
Your limbs are just clumsy.

697
00:29:50,179 --> 00:29:51,499
I could barely watch you driving.

698
00:29:51,699 --> 00:29:53,179
Don't watch it then.

699
00:29:53,379 --> 00:29:54,059
Are you here to find faults with me

700
00:29:54,059 --> 00:29:54,859
and to mock me?

701
00:29:54,859 --> 00:29:56,499
I'm worried that you'll get scammed.

702
00:29:56,739 --> 00:29:57,459
So what?

703
00:29:57,899 --> 00:29:59,579
I'm a grown-up now.
It's impossible if someone abducts me.

704
00:29:59,579 --> 00:30:00,459
What if there is?

705
00:30:01,939 --> 00:30:02,859
I must come

706
00:30:02,859 --> 00:30:03,819
to keep you in check.

707
00:30:05,339 --> 00:30:06,019
Wait.

708
00:30:06,339 --> 00:30:08,059
What has it got to do with you?

709
00:30:08,059 --> 00:30:09,579
Why do you care so much?

710
00:30:09,899 --> 00:30:10,779
Do you really not know

711
00:30:10,779 --> 00:30:11,979
or are you pretending?

712
00:30:12,659 --> 00:30:13,619
I care about you

713
00:30:14,179 --> 00:30:15,579
because I like you.

714
00:30:20,779 --> 00:30:21,739
You like me?

715
00:30:25,059 --> 00:30:26,819
Did you say this to every girl?

716
00:30:27,539 --> 00:30:28,299
What?

717
00:30:28,939 --> 00:30:30,939
"I like you", "Wait for you",
and "I care about you".

718
00:30:31,659 --> 00:30:33,179
If you called this love,
isn't it cheap?

719
00:30:33,659 --> 00:30:34,459
Cheap?

720
00:30:34,859 --> 00:30:35,419
Yes.

721
00:30:35,939 --> 00:30:36,659
You're cheap

722
00:30:36,659 --> 00:30:37,939
and a flip-flopper.

723
00:30:38,379 --> 00:30:39,419
I'm a flip-flopper?

724
00:30:40,059 --> 00:30:41,059
Even a doctor states the illness

725
00:30:41,059 --> 00:30:42,219
after diagnosis.

726
00:30:42,219 --> 00:30:43,819
How could you decide my problem
on your own accord?

727
00:30:44,339 --> 00:30:44,939
Well.

728
00:30:45,459 --> 00:30:46,539
Let me tell you.

729
00:30:47,179 --> 00:30:48,979
You said you would wait for me.

730
00:30:49,419 --> 00:30:50,179
Yet, you are sweet on Wei Mingya

731
00:30:50,179 --> 00:30:51,179
right after you came here

732
00:30:51,179 --> 00:30:51,779
and staying close to her.

733
00:30:51,779 --> 00:30:52,539
Indeed,

734
00:30:52,539 --> 00:30:53,339
you are the flip-flopper.

735
00:30:53,979 --> 00:30:54,979
Wei Mingya?

736
00:30:55,179 --> 00:30:55,579
Yes.

737
00:30:56,059 --> 00:30:57,059
The one who celebrated

738
00:30:57,059 --> 00:30:57,979
your 19th birthday.

739
00:30:57,979 --> 00:30:59,259
The one you promised
to give her happiness

740
00:30:59,259 --> 00:31:00,299
during the rehearsal.

741
00:31:00,299 --> 00:31:01,259
This is it, Wei Mingya.

742
00:31:02,579 --> 00:31:04,139
It turns out you're mad at me
because of her.

743
00:31:04,699 --> 00:31:05,659
Isn't that enough?

744
00:31:06,379 --> 00:31:06,939
Fine.

745
00:31:07,419 --> 00:31:08,579
Let me show you

746
00:31:08,939 --> 00:31:10,059
what her happiness is.

747
00:31:10,899 --> 00:31:12,019
Let go of me.

748
00:31:12,019 --> 00:31:12,739
Hey.

749
00:31:17,699 --> 00:31:18,939
Why do you come so late?

750
00:31:19,499 --> 00:31:20,419
Are you still my buddy?

751
00:31:22,139 --> 00:31:23,779
My lecturer keeps urging me
for photographs every day.

752
00:31:23,779 --> 00:31:25,539
I didn't expect photography
could be so tiring.

753
00:31:25,979 --> 00:31:27,179
So, I come once I have free time.

754
00:31:27,859 --> 00:31:28,699
How have you been?

755
00:31:30,179 --> 00:31:32,859
I'm trying to participate
in the national competition.

756
00:31:33,379 --> 00:31:36,099
I want to give her the gold medal

757
00:31:36,579 --> 00:31:37,219
I should've given her two years ago.

758
00:31:39,099 --> 00:31:40,699
How loyal of you.

759
00:31:41,499 --> 00:31:43,539
Does she know your ligament was torn

760
00:31:43,539 --> 00:31:44,619
to get her the gold medal last time?

761
00:31:44,819 --> 00:31:45,819
She doesn't need to know this.

762
00:31:46,379 --> 00:31:46,859
Look.

763
00:31:47,499 --> 00:31:49,059
I can run the whole day with it.

764
00:31:49,059 --> 00:31:49,859
I'm good.

765
00:31:56,899 --> 00:31:57,699
But,

766
00:31:58,499 --> 00:31:59,619
I'm clueless about

767
00:31:59,899 --> 00:32:01,539
whether I'm qualified

768
00:32:02,179 --> 00:32:03,019
for the national competition.

769
00:32:04,219 --> 00:32:05,339
No worries, Kai.

770
00:32:05,699 --> 00:32:06,379
Look.

771
00:32:06,379 --> 00:32:07,579
I'm preparing for the exhibition lately.

772
00:32:08,019 --> 00:32:09,139
I have been taking your photos

773
00:32:09,139 --> 00:32:09,939
while you were training just now.

774
00:32:10,699 --> 00:32:11,619
Speaking of which,

775
00:32:11,899 --> 00:32:13,099
most of your photos came out well.

776
00:32:13,499 --> 00:32:16,019
You can be a top model for sure
if you switch your profession.

777
00:32:17,859 --> 00:32:19,859
I think I might win the award
with these photos.

778
00:32:20,099 --> 00:32:21,139
Thanks to you.

779
00:32:21,139 --> 00:32:22,299
Bugger off.

780
00:32:22,299 --> 00:32:23,259
You must buy me a meal.

781
00:32:23,259 --> 00:32:23,899
Sure.

782
00:32:23,899 --> 00:32:24,739
Of course.

783
00:32:25,179 --> 00:32:26,259
Eat to your heart's content.

784
00:32:26,499 --> 00:32:26,979
Come on.

785
00:32:26,979 --> 00:32:27,979
Let's go now.

786
00:32:31,859 --> 00:32:32,419
Coach.

787
00:32:34,099 --> 00:32:34,819
I got it?

788
00:32:35,739 --> 00:32:36,379
Seriously?

789
00:32:37,339 --> 00:32:38,179
Thank you so much, coach.

790
00:32:38,779 --> 00:32:39,619
We will eat the other day.

791
00:32:39,619 --> 00:32:40,459
I need to leave now.

792
00:32:41,219 --> 00:32:42,059
Where are you going?

793
00:32:42,059 --> 00:32:43,699
I'm qualified for
the national competition.

794
00:32:43,699 --> 00:32:44,619
I'm going to ask Lin Xi

795
00:32:44,619 --> 00:32:45,939
to reserve the place
as her boyfriend now.

796
00:32:47,059 --> 00:32:47,539
Never come back

797
00:32:47,539 --> 00:32:48,499
until you get her.

798
00:33:01,339 --> 00:33:01,859
Hi.

799
00:33:02,179 --> 00:33:04,539
Are you Lin Xi's roommate, Yi?

800
00:33:04,819 --> 00:33:05,619
Yes, I am.

801
00:33:05,619 --> 00:33:07,099
Is Lin Xi in?

802
00:33:07,099 --> 00:33:07,539
No.

803
00:33:07,539 --> 00:33:08,539
She called me

804
00:33:08,539 --> 00:33:10,179
that she went to the bridge
beside the park.

805
00:33:10,179 --> 00:33:10,899
And she will be back late tonight.

806
00:33:11,339 --> 00:33:12,939
The bridge beside the park?

807
00:33:12,939 --> 00:33:13,699
With whom?

808
00:33:13,899 --> 00:33:15,459
Ji Junxing, I guess.

809
00:33:21,419 --> 00:33:22,819
Where are you taking me?

810
00:33:24,339 --> 00:33:25,019
Answer me.

811
00:33:25,139 --> 00:33:26,379
Where are you taking me?

812
00:33:42,899 --> 00:33:43,779
What are they doing here?

813
00:33:44,179 --> 00:33:44,739
Preparing for a proposal.

814
00:33:45,499 --> 00:33:46,419
A proposal?

815
00:33:47,099 --> 00:33:47,939
Ji Junxing.

816
00:33:52,019 --> 00:33:53,179
You're here, finally.

817
00:33:53,619 --> 00:33:54,579
I get you a helper.

818
00:33:55,379 --> 00:33:56,099
Hello.

819
00:33:56,459 --> 00:33:57,219
Ji Junxing.

820
00:33:57,219 --> 00:33:57,659
Gosh.

821
00:33:57,659 --> 00:33:58,579
I'm so nervous.

822
00:33:58,579 --> 00:34:00,139
My hands are cold.

823
00:34:00,379 --> 00:34:02,059
Can you help me

824
00:34:02,059 --> 00:34:03,539
with the drone again?

825
00:34:03,539 --> 00:34:05,019
I'm scared I will make a mistake later.

826
00:34:05,019 --> 00:34:06,019
No need.

827
00:34:06,019 --> 00:34:07,459
Take off, hover and land.

828
00:34:07,459 --> 00:34:08,499
It is simple.

829
00:34:08,499 --> 00:34:09,299
You have been practicing it
for months.

830
00:34:09,299 --> 00:34:10,539
I'm sure you get this.

831
00:34:11,099 --> 00:34:13,219
Still, I'm nervous.

832
00:34:13,219 --> 00:34:14,739
Even if something happens,

833
00:34:15,219 --> 00:34:16,219
he won't mind it either.

834
00:34:16,779 --> 00:34:18,299
Your sincerity matters the most.

835
00:34:18,619 --> 00:34:19,339
Don't worry.

836
00:34:20,259 --> 00:34:21,619
He can feel your sincerity for sure.

837
00:34:22,419 --> 00:34:23,419
Well, then.

838
00:34:24,379 --> 00:34:24,979
Oh, right.

839
00:34:25,259 --> 00:34:25,939
Thank you for much.

840
00:34:26,259 --> 00:34:28,139
I think I have disturbed you both

841
00:34:28,779 --> 00:34:30,899
recently, right?

842
00:34:31,219 --> 00:34:32,379
I will buy you a meal next time.

843
00:34:32,379 --> 00:34:33,899
You must buy us a great meal.

844
00:34:34,179 --> 00:34:35,019
No problem.

845
00:34:35,019 --> 00:34:35,419
By the way,

846
00:34:35,739 --> 00:34:36,539
take these.

847
00:34:38,379 --> 00:34:40,019
I need to get ready now.

848
00:34:40,019 --> 00:34:40,859
Sure, off you go.

849
00:34:41,099 --> 00:34:41,779
See you later.

850
00:34:42,019 --> 00:34:42,459
Good luck.

851
00:34:45,859 --> 00:34:47,339
What were you talking about?

852
00:34:47,579 --> 00:34:48,659
Disturbed us two?

853
00:34:48,659 --> 00:34:49,339
I don't get it.

854
00:34:49,899 --> 00:34:51,139
You will know later.

855
00:34:54,459 --> 00:34:55,979
Is this okay, Mingya?

856
00:34:56,219 --> 00:34:57,379
Yes.

857
00:34:58,459 --> 00:34:59,139
Mingya.

858
00:34:59,619 --> 00:35:00,579
Your boyfriend is here.

859
00:35:06,899 --> 00:35:07,659
Who is he?

860
00:35:08,459 --> 00:35:09,299
Wei Mingya's boyfriend.

861
00:35:09,619 --> 00:35:11,099
They have been together for three years.

862
00:35:11,339 --> 00:35:12,339
He graduated

863
00:35:12,339 --> 00:35:13,659
from the air force department
of the Military University.

864
00:35:17,419 --> 00:35:18,379
There are so many people here.

865
00:35:19,019 --> 00:35:19,779
What are they doing here?

866
00:35:20,099 --> 00:35:20,899
Silent.

867
00:35:21,419 --> 00:35:21,979
Attention!

868
00:35:22,219 --> 00:35:23,059
Face forward.

869
00:35:25,459 --> 00:35:26,779
Do you know what today is?

870
00:35:27,139 --> 00:35:27,859
Of course.

871
00:35:28,099 --> 00:35:30,059
It's our third anniversary.

872
00:35:30,619 --> 00:35:31,579
Besides,

873
00:35:32,739 --> 00:35:34,299
it's also the last day

874
00:35:34,299 --> 00:35:35,059
we stay in the same city.

875
00:35:36,099 --> 00:35:37,099
Tomorrow,

876
00:35:37,619 --> 00:35:39,459
you are going to
the air force department.

877
00:35:41,859 --> 00:35:42,619
And we

878
00:35:44,059 --> 00:35:45,699
won't be meeting each other
for the next six months.

879
00:35:46,819 --> 00:35:48,739
I remember that you told me

880
00:35:49,899 --> 00:35:51,339
if a pilot has someone he misses
on the land,

881
00:35:51,819 --> 00:35:54,259
he will fly well.

882
00:35:55,579 --> 00:35:56,459
Otherwise,

883
00:35:57,259 --> 00:35:58,619
the flight will be long

884
00:35:59,459 --> 00:36:00,779
and aimless.

885
00:36:02,419 --> 00:36:03,339
I would like to be your goal

886
00:36:04,059 --> 00:36:06,459
when you return to the land.

887
00:36:07,539 --> 00:36:09,459
Regardless of how far or high

888
00:36:10,179 --> 00:36:10,939
you fly,

889
00:36:13,059 --> 00:36:14,619
I will wait

890
00:36:17,379 --> 00:36:18,419
for you to land safely.

891
00:36:29,259 --> 00:36:30,259
Give me a second.

892
00:36:32,219 --> 00:36:32,819
Thanks.

893
00:36:54,739 --> 00:36:55,339
Come on.

894
00:37:00,459 --> 00:37:01,419
Open it.

895
00:37:19,899 --> 00:37:20,939
This is

896
00:37:21,339 --> 00:37:22,179
the engagement ring?

897
00:37:25,779 --> 00:37:27,659
I should be the one preparing this
though.

898
00:37:27,899 --> 00:37:28,819
I don't mind.

899
00:37:30,419 --> 00:37:31,739
So,

900
00:37:32,859 --> 00:37:34,739
may I be the land where you return to?

901
00:37:37,859 --> 00:37:38,699
Yes.

Erm...

926
00:38:49,939 --> 00:38:51,579
Something came up
in my faculty.

927
00:38:51,579 --> 00:38:52,499
I need to leave now.

928
00:38:52,739 --> 00:38:53,499
Do you mean the event
in Building 2 Room 403

929
00:38:53,499 --> 00:38:54,619
at 8:00 p.m. tonight?

930
00:38:55,099 --> 00:38:55,859
It is 10 p.m. now.

931
00:38:56,139 --> 00:38:56,939
The event has already ended.

932
00:38:59,379 --> 00:39:00,739
My roommate asked for me.

933
00:39:00,739 --> 00:39:01,579
I need to leave now.

934
00:39:01,819 --> 00:39:02,659
Lin Xi.

935
00:39:03,619 --> 00:39:04,899
You can't leave today

936
00:39:04,899 --> 00:39:05,899
no matter what excuse you make.

937
00:39:06,339 --> 00:39:07,619
You made such a mess

938
00:39:07,619 --> 00:39:09,139
and took me wrong these days.

939
00:39:09,579 --> 00:39:11,019
Don't you have anything to say to me?

940
00:39:11,819 --> 00:39:13,179
Am I to be blamed for all?

941
00:39:13,939 --> 00:39:15,139
I specially prepared a cake

942
00:39:15,379 --> 00:39:17,179
for your birthday.

943
00:39:17,899 --> 00:39:19,059
Yet what I had in return

944
00:39:19,059 --> 00:39:20,539
was a photo of you sitting closely
to Mingya.

945
00:39:21,179 --> 00:39:23,059
I wanted to call you to ask about it

946
00:39:23,059 --> 00:39:24,299
but she picked up my call.

947
00:39:24,299 --> 00:39:25,339
What should I do then?

948
00:39:25,859 --> 00:39:27,499
Is that why you thought
I like her?

949
00:39:28,499 --> 00:39:29,899
What about the promise we made together?

950
00:39:30,459 --> 00:39:31,219
Did you forget about it?

951
00:39:35,819 --> 00:39:36,619
I guess

952
00:39:38,899 --> 00:39:40,379
it isn't all because of her.

953
00:39:41,499 --> 00:39:42,459
At that time

954
00:39:43,339 --> 00:39:44,899
you were leading a brand new life.

955
00:39:46,099 --> 00:39:47,219
You went to the university,

956
00:39:48,139 --> 00:39:49,819
making lots of new friends

957
00:39:50,379 --> 00:39:51,659
and experiencing new things.

958
00:39:52,939 --> 00:39:54,379
You kept moving forward.

959
00:39:55,379 --> 00:39:57,219
However, I was walking in circles,

960
00:39:59,819 --> 00:40:01,939
doing practices

961
00:40:02,619 --> 00:40:03,979
and sitting for tests repeatedly.

962
00:40:05,219 --> 00:40:06,619
Repeat the same, simple

963
00:40:06,939 --> 00:40:08,379
and dull life

964
00:40:08,379 --> 00:40:09,619
every single day.

965
00:40:10,379 --> 00:40:13,579
You mentioned clubs,

966
00:40:13,579 --> 00:40:14,579
theaters,

967
00:40:14,579 --> 00:40:16,219
dating, competitions or whatsoever.

968
00:40:16,659 --> 00:40:18,539
None of them I can relate to.

969
00:40:21,899 --> 00:40:23,099
I thought

970
00:40:25,379 --> 00:40:26,979
we have nothing to share in common.

971
00:40:29,939 --> 00:40:31,259
You said something wrong.

972
00:40:35,299 --> 00:40:36,539
I don't keep moving forward

973
00:40:37,899 --> 00:40:39,579
nor are you walking in circles.

974
00:40:41,139 --> 00:40:42,219
What I know

975
00:40:42,899 --> 00:40:44,539
is that you've been striving hard
to get admitted to Jinghua University

976
00:40:45,059 --> 00:40:46,259
and I believed you could make it.

977
00:40:47,139 --> 00:40:49,059
I have been waiting for you.

978
00:40:50,219 --> 00:40:52,179
Both of us have been working hard

979
00:40:52,179 --> 00:40:52,979
to approach each other.

980
00:40:53,579 --> 00:40:55,819
It is true that time and distance
create barriers.

981
00:40:56,379 --> 00:40:58,259
But the best way to break it off

982
00:40:59,019 --> 00:41:00,339
is to communicate with pure trust.

983
00:41:01,539 --> 00:41:02,219
Lin Xi.

984
00:41:03,859 --> 00:41:05,619
Will you just trust me?

985
00:41:15,819 --> 00:41:16,619
I'm sorry.

986
00:41:18,419 --> 00:41:19,659
Your apology

987
00:41:21,179 --> 00:41:23,579
reminds me that I'm the one supposed
to be mad.

988
00:41:24,099 --> 00:41:25,659
You don't have trust in me.

989
00:41:25,659 --> 00:41:26,579
It seems that we have

990
00:41:26,979 --> 00:41:28,059
gone through everything
for nothing.

991
00:41:31,259 --> 00:41:33,699
Well, I'll give you a chance
to flick my forehead.

992
00:41:37,379 --> 00:41:38,019
Bring it on.

993
00:41:41,779 --> 00:41:42,619
Be gentle.

994
00:41:42,939 --> 00:41:43,499
Forget it.

995
00:41:43,939 --> 00:41:45,299
Do it as hard as you want

996
00:41:45,699 --> 00:41:46,699
if it takes the edge off your anger.

997
00:41:52,019 --> 00:41:52,779
Lin Xi.

998
00:41:54,099 --> 00:41:55,339
Will you be my girlfriend?

999
00:41:57,139 --> 00:41:57,739
I...

1000
00:42:02,899 --> 00:42:04,259
