Don't you know how to knock?

18
00:02:11,962 --> 00:02:12,802
So...Sorry.

19
00:02:12,802 --> 00:02:14,642
I'm... I'm used to
not knocking back at home.

20
00:02:15,802 --> 00:02:17,122
I didn't see anything.

21
00:02:25,482 --> 00:02:26,082
What's the matter?

22
00:02:28,162 --> 00:02:29,522
You wore your shirt wrongly.

23
00:02:31,762 --> 00:02:32,962
This is how it's designed.

24
00:02:43,682 --> 00:02:45,162
Am I that bad at fashion?

25
00:03:49,002 --> 00:03:49,762
Ji Junxing.

26
00:03:51,202 --> 00:03:52,242
Let's be friends.

27
00:03:55,482 --> 00:03:56,522
Ji Junxing.

28
00:03:57,602 --> 00:03:58,522
I love you.

29
00:04:58,082 --> 00:04:59,082
(That can't be true.)

30
00:05:28,282 --> 00:05:29,202
What are you doing?

31
00:05:34,242 --> 00:05:35,842
I was having a hard time falling asleep,
so I wanted to drink some water.

32
00:05:36,162 --> 00:05:37,602
I only took the first sip

33
00:05:37,602 --> 00:05:38,922
when I heard you coming down the stairs.

34
00:05:39,642 --> 00:05:41,202
Then, I was reminded of your advice,

35
00:05:41,482 --> 00:05:43,002
telling me to watch my behavior
when I'm living at your place.

36
00:05:43,402 --> 00:05:44,522
I agreed with what you said,

37
00:05:44,522 --> 00:05:46,402
so I found myself a hiding place.

38
00:05:46,882 --> 00:05:47,402
Great.

39
00:05:47,682 --> 00:05:48,482
It makes perfect sense.

40
00:05:48,762 --> 00:05:50,362
I can't refute whatever you said too.

41
00:05:50,962 --> 00:05:52,762
I guess so.

42
00:05:53,602 --> 00:05:55,002
My main concern
is not wanting to scare you.

43
00:05:55,602 --> 00:05:57,042
But I think you're trying to scare me.

44
00:06:00,962 --> 00:06:01,882
What else do you want?

45
00:06:02,362 --> 00:06:03,522
You're holding the tomato sauce.

46
00:06:05,722 --> 00:06:07,002
Tomato sauce is exactly what I want.

47
00:06:41,122 --> 00:06:41,802
Lin Xi.

48
00:06:42,442 --> 00:06:43,522
You're done for.

49
00:06:44,082 --> 00:06:45,442
It's only the first day,
and because of you,

50
00:06:45,442 --> 00:06:46,842
he was late to class, got punished,
and had to write a reflection letter.

51
00:06:47,042 --> 00:06:48,322
You scared him big time too.

52
00:06:51,562 --> 00:06:53,282
How are you going to be his friend?

53
00:07:30,962 --> 00:07:31,962
Good morning, Madam Wen.

54
00:07:32,642 --> 00:07:33,722
Good morning. You're up.

55
00:07:35,002 --> 00:07:37,002
Did you sleep well?

56
00:07:37,402 --> 00:07:39,562
Did you hear any weird noises at night?

57
00:07:39,922 --> 00:07:41,002
Weird noises?

58
00:07:42,722 --> 00:07:43,562
I didn't hear anything.

59
00:07:43,802 --> 00:07:44,842
I'm well-rested.

60
00:07:46,082 --> 00:07:46,482
By the way,

61
00:07:47,162 --> 00:07:48,522
I saw this
in the property owners' chat group.

62
00:07:48,642 --> 00:07:49,722
Our neighbors said

63
00:07:49,962 --> 00:07:50,642
that their dog
was barking hysterically

64
00:07:50,642 --> 00:07:52,242
at midnight yesterday.

65
00:07:52,282 --> 00:07:53,322
Did it wake you up?

66
00:07:54,202 --> 00:07:54,562
No.

67
00:07:55,202 --> 00:07:56,162
I was sleeping rather soundly.

68
00:07:56,922 --> 00:07:57,602
That's good.

69
00:07:57,602 --> 00:07:59,282
I was worried that
you wouldn't be able to get a good rest.

70
00:08:00,162 --> 00:08:00,722
I'm fine.

71
00:08:00,722 --> 00:08:01,522
Have an egg.

72
00:08:01,642 --> 00:08:02,162
Thank you.

74

75
00:08:30,882 --> 00:08:31,482
Ji Junxing.

76
00:08:31,722 --> 00:08:32,722
Are you done washing up?

77
00:08:33,002 --> 00:08:34,042
Come and have breakfast.

78
00:08:35,722 --> 00:08:36,842
You can eat all you want.

79
00:08:37,762 --> 00:08:39,562
Why are you so grumpy
early in the morning?

80
00:08:46,042 --> 00:08:46,762
Junxing.

81
00:08:47,042 --> 00:08:47,722
Make sure

82
00:08:47,722 --> 00:08:48,962
you send Lin Xi to school in one piece.

83
00:08:48,962 --> 00:08:49,722
Did you hear me?

84
00:08:50,282 --> 00:08:50,802
Mom.

85
00:08:50,802 --> 00:08:51,722
If you're worried about her,

86
00:08:51,722 --> 00:08:53,562
you can risk being late for work

87
00:08:53,562 --> 00:08:54,482
and send her to school personally.

88
00:08:54,842 --> 00:08:55,922
Little rascal.

89
00:08:56,122 --> 00:08:56,882
I do have

90
00:08:56,882 --> 00:08:58,602
some confidence in you.

91
00:09:00,202 --> 00:09:00,722
Lin Xi.

92
00:09:00,882 --> 00:09:02,122
I've got to go.

93
00:09:02,442 --> 00:09:03,042
Bye.

94
00:09:03,042 --> 00:09:03,922
See you tonight, Madam.

95
00:09:09,122 --> 00:09:09,842
What are you doing?

96
00:09:12,882 --> 00:09:14,602
Madam told you
to send me to school, right?

97
00:09:14,962 --> 00:09:15,562
Come here.

98
00:09:19,362 --> 00:09:20,842
Never let anyone find out

99
00:09:20,842 --> 00:09:21,922
that we're living together.

100
00:09:22,442 --> 00:09:23,042
Bear in mind.

101
00:09:23,242 --> 00:09:23,882
I'll keep it to myself.

102
00:09:26,122 --> 00:09:27,562
How do I go to school from here?

103
00:09:28,082 --> 00:09:30,322
Turn right after you exit this area.
Take Bus Number 14.

Ji Junxing.

106
00:09:52,322 --> 00:09:53,122
There was something
I couldn't understand

107
00:09:53,122 --> 00:09:54,202
from yesterday's English class.

108
00:09:54,202 --> 00:09:55,402
Can you explain it to me?

109
00:09:55,522 --> 00:09:56,242
Which part do you not understand?

110
00:09:56,442 --> 00:09:57,922
The question about passive voice.

111
00:10:00,642 --> 00:10:01,882
Let's discuss it on our way to school.

112
00:10:01,882 --> 00:10:02,402
Sure.

113
00:10:04,842 --> 00:10:05,482
For this question...

114
00:10:05,602 --> 00:10:07,522
It's quite difficult.

115
00:10:10,562 --> 00:10:11,402
What are you staring at?

116
00:10:11,402 --> 00:10:12,842
You're scaring me.

117
00:10:14,602 --> 00:10:17,122
Is Ji Junxing always this popular?

118
00:10:17,322 --> 00:10:18,042
Of course.

119
00:10:18,402 --> 00:10:20,282
What are the two types
of popular guys in school?

120
00:10:21,202 --> 00:10:23,522
The first type is guys
who're gentle and good at studies.

121
00:10:23,802 --> 00:10:25,682
And the other type is boys
who are good-looking and sporty.

122
00:10:26,082 --> 00:10:27,122
And Ji Junxing

123
00:10:27,122 --> 00:10:28,722
is a combination of both.

124
00:10:29,082 --> 00:10:30,362
You'll find out more
when you spend more time with him.

125
00:10:33,002 --> 00:10:33,642
Let's go.

126
00:10:43,562 --> 00:10:45,202
It's quite convenient for you
to travel to school.

127
00:10:45,722 --> 00:10:47,282
We agreed to keep it a secret, right?

128
00:10:47,962 --> 00:10:48,802
Sorry.

129
00:10:59,402 --> 00:11:01,082
Is she rolling her eyes at me?

130
00:11:03,762 --> 00:11:05,922
She has rolled her eyes at you
for several times.

131
00:11:12,682 --> 00:11:13,562
We'll start the class now.

132
00:11:16,642 --> 00:11:18,282
I have an announcement to make
before we commence the class.

133
00:11:18,962 --> 00:11:20,522
The school authority
will be here next week

134
00:11:20,522 --> 00:11:21,842
and join
one of our public English classes.

135
00:11:21,842 --> 00:11:22,842
I need six students

136
00:11:22,842 --> 00:11:24,322
to present a sketch.

137
00:11:24,322 --> 00:11:25,642
Ji Junxing,
you are the class representative.

138
00:11:25,962 --> 00:11:27,282
Make some arrangements for the sketch.

139
00:11:28,522 --> 00:11:29,402
Take the script.

140
00:11:29,402 --> 00:11:29,962
Sure.

141
00:11:39,642 --> 00:11:41,362
Any of you wants to join the sketch?

142
00:11:42,002 --> 00:11:43,722
It's a good chance to skip classes.

143
00:11:43,922 --> 00:11:44,522
Me. I'm joining!

144
00:11:44,522 --> 00:11:45,162
You're right.

145
00:11:45,242 --> 00:11:45,922
I want to join too.

146
00:11:47,082 --> 00:11:47,602
Me too!

147
00:11:48,562 --> 00:11:49,082
Miss.

148
00:11:49,682 --> 00:11:50,642
I volunteer

149
00:11:50,762 --> 00:11:52,282
to help Ji Junxing with the sketch.

150
00:11:52,842 --> 00:11:53,282
Sure.

151
00:11:58,042 --> 00:11:59,722
There will be five of us including me.

152
00:12:00,042 --> 00:12:01,362
Anyone else wants to join us?

153
00:12:02,842 --> 00:12:03,722
I want to join the sketch.

154
00:12:11,122 --> 00:12:11,922
Working Cell.

155
00:12:12,322 --> 00:12:13,842
It's a relatively simple story.

156
00:12:13,842 --> 00:12:15,042
Simply put.

157
00:12:15,322 --> 00:12:17,082
Streptococcus pneumonia
invaded the human lungs.

158
00:12:17,082 --> 00:12:19,442
The red and white blood cells
then work together to chase it out.

159
00:12:20,042 --> 00:12:21,282
You have read the script.

160
00:12:21,602 --> 00:12:23,242
Pick a character you're interested in.

161
00:12:28,682 --> 00:12:29,682
I'll be the villain.

162
00:12:29,882 --> 00:12:31,842
The villain is usually the strongest.

163
00:12:32,682 --> 00:12:33,082
Sure.

164
00:12:34,002 --> 00:12:35,722
What about the white blood cell?

165
00:12:36,242 --> 00:12:37,162
Anybody wants
to be the white blood cell?

166
00:12:37,522 --> 00:12:38,722
These vocabularies are too advanced.

167
00:12:38,842 --> 00:12:40,122
I can't remember the lines.

168
00:12:40,482 --> 00:12:42,442
It's a difficult task
and it's also the main hero.

169
00:12:42,442 --> 00:12:43,962
Junxing, you should do it.

170
00:12:45,202 --> 00:12:45,842
Sure.

171
00:12:46,242 --> 00:12:47,442
I'll be the white blood cell then.

172
00:12:48,722 --> 00:12:49,802
Then, I will act as the red blood cell.

173
00:12:53,562 --> 00:12:55,202
I speak very decent English.

174
00:12:55,602 --> 00:12:58,162
Besides, I am deeply moved

175
00:12:58,162 --> 00:12:59,002
by the hug shared between
the red blood cell

176
00:12:59,002 --> 00:13:00,402
and the white blood cell
at the end of the story.

177
00:13:01,282 --> 00:13:01,882
I'm sure

178
00:13:01,882 --> 00:13:03,362
I can give my best performance.

179
00:13:08,962 --> 00:13:10,802
Anyone else wants this character?

180
00:13:16,802 --> 00:13:17,522
Of course.

181
00:13:20,042 --> 00:13:20,802
You want to play the character, huh?

182
00:13:22,482 --> 00:13:23,722
Can you speak fluently?

183
00:13:25,322 --> 00:13:25,762
No.

184
00:13:25,962 --> 00:13:26,562
He will play the character.

185
00:13:27,242 --> 00:13:27,842
Me?

186
00:13:29,482 --> 00:13:29,922
Yes.

187
00:13:30,402 --> 00:13:31,202
You will do it.

188
00:13:34,602 --> 00:13:35,322
Yes. I'll do it.

189
00:13:36,322 --> 00:13:37,402
It's the perfect role for me.

190
00:13:37,602 --> 00:13:38,642
And if the play

191
00:13:38,642 --> 00:13:40,042
ends with a hug,

192
00:13:40,202 --> 00:13:41,042
of course, it has to be me.

193
00:13:41,802 --> 00:13:42,962
But you're a boy.

194
00:13:43,402 --> 00:13:44,722
The red blood cell is the heroine.

195
00:13:46,202 --> 00:13:48,162
It'd be really fun
to see him cross-dress.

196
00:13:48,922 --> 00:13:49,762
Yes. Cross-dressing.

197
00:13:50,002 --> 00:13:51,442
It's a very interesting idea.

198
00:13:51,722 --> 00:13:52,482
I agree.

199
00:13:53,002 --> 00:13:53,442
But Xie Ang...

200
00:13:53,442 --> 00:13:54,562
Let's vote.

201
00:13:54,842 --> 00:13:56,002
If you agree that
Xie Ang should be the red blood cell,

202
00:13:56,002 --> 00:13:56,562
raise your hand.

203
00:14:07,322 --> 00:14:08,682
Four and two.

204
00:14:08,882 --> 00:14:10,882
It's decided.

205
00:14:43,762 --> 00:14:45,282
Junxing wants us
to go to the east of the field.

206
00:14:45,402 --> 00:14:47,082
We'll do a rehearsal under the lamp post
right before the third tree.

207
00:14:47,962 --> 00:14:49,562
Do we really have to
act so secretive for a rehearsal?

208
00:14:51,122 --> 00:14:52,402
They never turn off
the street light there.

209
00:14:52,402 --> 00:14:53,362
No one will notice us.

210
00:14:55,162 --> 00:14:56,042
Will they

211
00:14:56,042 --> 00:14:56,842
be there too?

212
00:14:57,242 --> 00:14:57,842
Of course.

213
00:14:58,922 --> 00:14:59,602
Do you think Ji Junxing

214
00:14:59,602 --> 00:15:00,682
will want to meet you there alone?

215
00:15:02,282 --> 00:15:03,082
In your dreams.

216
00:15:26,522 --> 00:15:28,322
One. Two. Three.

217
00:15:29,042 --> 00:15:30,402
I'm at the right place.

218
00:15:31,242 --> 00:15:32,562
Why is no one here yet?

219
00:15:48,002 --> 00:15:49,082
How dare you bite me?

220
00:15:54,242 --> 00:15:56,082
Despite the difficult circumstances,

221
00:15:56,802 --> 00:15:58,362
we continue
with our rehearsal late at night.

222
00:15:58,922 --> 00:16:00,682
We deserve an Academy Award

223
00:16:00,842 --> 00:16:02,322
for all the hard work we put in,

224
00:16:02,762 --> 00:16:03,322
or our cast and crew

225
00:16:03,322 --> 00:16:04,682
will be very disappointed.

226
00:16:11,762 --> 00:16:13,002
I'm a bad cell.

227
00:16:13,482 --> 00:16:14,402
I am dying.

228
00:16:15,122 --> 00:16:16,322
I'm a bad cell.

229
00:16:16,962 --> 00:16:17,882
I am dying.

230
00:16:19,282 --> 00:16:20,562
I'm a bad cell.

231
00:16:21,042 --> 00:16:22,002
I am dying.

232
00:16:26,242 --> 00:16:27,362
Have you taken your dinner?

233
00:16:27,642 --> 00:16:28,962
I bought some supper.

234
00:16:29,882 --> 00:16:31,442
Tell Lin Xi to join us.

235
00:16:32,002 --> 00:16:32,802
She's not home yet.

236
00:16:35,122 --> 00:16:36,162
She's not home yet?

237
00:16:36,722 --> 00:16:37,842
But it's late now.

238
00:16:38,002 --> 00:16:39,282
Where did she go?
Why is she not home yet?

239
00:16:40,202 --> 00:16:40,722
I have no idea.

240
00:16:44,242 --> 00:16:46,282
Then, why are you still here
watching the TV show?

241
00:16:46,482 --> 00:16:47,402
I told you

242
00:16:47,402 --> 00:16:49,242
to go to school and come home together.

243
00:16:49,242 --> 00:16:50,482
How can you not know where she went?

244
00:16:50,802 --> 00:16:52,482
She has her own social life.

245
00:16:52,562 --> 00:16:53,882
I'm not her minion.

246
00:16:54,122 --> 00:16:54,922
I can't follow her

247
00:16:54,922 --> 00:16:56,042
everywhere, right?

248
00:17:04,560 --> 00:17:05,980
(Madam Wen)

249
00:17:07,962 --> 00:17:08,962
Her phone is not with her.

250
00:17:10,762 --> 00:17:12,402
She didn't take her phone with her?

251
00:17:15,242 --> 00:17:16,362
She's a young girl.

252
00:17:16,362 --> 00:17:17,402
And it's late now.

253
00:17:17,402 --> 00:17:18,562
Why is she not home yet?

254
00:17:18,962 --> 00:17:20,122
She has already missed
the last bus of the day.

255
00:17:20,442 --> 00:17:21,682
How will she come home later?

256
00:17:23,842 --> 00:17:24,682
Enough, Mom.

257
00:17:26,202 --> 00:17:27,402
I'll go and find her now.

258
00:17:30,402 --> 00:17:31,842
What if she runs into a bad guy?

259
00:17:31,842 --> 00:17:32,522
It's late.

260
00:17:32,522 --> 00:17:33,722
And she's not home yet.

261
00:17:33,722 --> 00:17:35,122
I got it.

262
00:17:40,242 --> 00:17:41,482
I'm a bad cell.

263
00:17:41,962 --> 00:17:42,962
I am dying.

264
00:17:43,642 --> 00:17:45,002
I'm a bad cell.

265
00:17:45,362 --> 00:17:46,562
I am dying.

266
00:17:48,522 --> 00:17:50,042
Are they having dinner?

267
00:17:51,322 --> 00:17:52,362
I don't think so.

268
00:17:54,162 --> 00:17:55,562
I'm a bad cell.

269
00:17:55,562 --> 00:17:56,722
I am dying.

270
00:18:01,202 --> 00:18:02,122
My goodness.

271
00:18:02,442 --> 00:18:04,042
I'm hallucinating now.

272
00:18:07,322 --> 00:18:08,602
I've been reciting this for an hour.

273
00:18:08,602 --> 00:18:10,282
Why aren't they here yet?

274
00:18:10,722 --> 00:18:12,282
You're still alive.

275
00:18:14,522 --> 00:18:15,322
Who's there?

276
00:18:16,082 --> 00:18:16,922
Take it easy.

277
00:18:19,882 --> 00:18:21,562
Where did he go? Let's search that area.

278
00:18:21,762 --> 00:18:23,042
I saw him going this way.

279
00:18:23,442 --> 00:18:24,722
Where did he go?

280
00:18:24,722 --> 00:18:25,722
Where is he?

281
00:18:26,642 --> 00:18:27,842
I saw him just now.

282
00:18:30,562 --> 00:18:31,762
Let's split up.

283
00:18:31,762 --> 00:18:32,322
Sure.

284
00:18:33,882 --> 00:18:35,202
Where did he go?

285
00:18:41,682 --> 00:18:42,402
Who are you?

286
00:18:42,402 --> 00:18:44,282
We are schoolmates. I'm not a bad guy.

287
00:18:44,602 --> 00:18:45,522
Did I scare you?

288
00:18:48,522 --> 00:18:49,762
You scared me big time.

289
00:18:50,002 --> 00:18:51,122
I almost passed out.

290
00:18:51,562 --> 00:18:52,522
Come here.

291
00:18:57,122 --> 00:18:58,242
You're quite interesting.

292
00:18:58,442 --> 00:18:59,202
Are you new here?

293
00:19:00,362 --> 00:19:02,082
What tells you I'm a newbie?

294
00:19:02,842 --> 00:19:04,202
Everyone in this school

295
00:19:04,202 --> 00:19:05,762
thinks I'm a bad student.

296
00:19:06,162 --> 00:19:07,762
You're the only one
who's not afraid of me.

297
00:19:08,082 --> 00:19:09,082
You even bit me.

298
00:19:09,642 --> 00:19:10,202
That's because

299
00:19:10,322 --> 00:19:11,402
I'm different.

300
00:19:12,122 --> 00:19:12,602
Hi.

301
00:19:12,842 --> 00:19:13,522
My name is Qin Kai.

302
00:19:13,682 --> 00:19:14,402
I'm from Grade Two's Art Class.

303
00:19:14,602 --> 00:19:15,082
What about you?

304
00:19:17,362 --> 00:19:18,282
My name is Lin Xi.

305
00:19:18,482 --> 00:19:19,882
I'm a new student in
Class One, Grade Two.

306
00:19:23,322 --> 00:19:24,842
Nice to meet you.

307
00:19:25,842 --> 00:19:26,562
Keep looking.

308
00:19:27,402 --> 00:19:28,442
Come here.

309
00:19:29,682 --> 00:19:30,882
Why are they looking for you?

310
00:19:31,282 --> 00:19:32,682
I sneaked out to the internet cafe.

311
00:19:32,682 --> 00:19:33,922
I just got back here
by climbing over the wall.

312
00:19:34,322 --> 00:19:35,402
You're quite unlucky today.

313
00:19:35,722 --> 00:19:37,082
I don't think I'm unlucky.

314
00:19:37,202 --> 00:19:38,362
I got to know you.

315
00:19:38,802 --> 00:19:39,642
That's a very pleasant surprise.

316
00:19:40,602 --> 00:19:42,402
You would know what a real surprise is
after you leave this bush.

317
00:19:42,482 --> 00:19:43,842
This is more like an accident.

318
00:19:45,682 --> 00:19:46,922
Why are you here?

319
00:19:47,202 --> 00:19:47,522
I...

320
00:19:50,122 --> 00:19:51,962
I guess
my classmate pulled a prank on me.

321
00:19:54,522 --> 00:19:55,482
Search that area.

322
00:19:55,642 --> 00:19:56,282
Hurry up!

323
00:19:58,242 --> 00:19:59,242
What will happen if we get caught?

324
00:19:59,242 --> 00:20:00,842
According to the rules
of Chunhui High School,

325
00:20:01,202 --> 00:20:02,442
those who break the curfew

326
00:20:02,682 --> 00:20:04,682
will either be asked to write
a reflection letter or get expelled.

327
00:20:07,242 --> 00:20:09,042
I can't write another reflection letter.

328
00:20:09,682 --> 00:20:10,282
Where did he go?

329
00:20:10,282 --> 00:20:11,642
I saw him going this way.

330
00:20:11,962 --> 00:20:12,922
Where did he go?

331
00:20:12,922 --> 00:20:13,922
Are you a runner?

332
00:20:14,722 --> 00:20:16,362
I guess so.

333
00:20:16,802 --> 00:20:17,962
You'll go that way and I'll go this way.

334
00:20:17,962 --> 00:20:18,722
Are you ready?

335
00:20:19,882 --> 00:20:20,322
Run!

336
00:20:20,642 --> 00:20:22,642
Stop running. Stand there!

337
00:20:22,642 --> 00:20:23,522
Stop running!

338
00:20:24,242 --> 00:20:24,682
Hurry up!

339
00:20:24,962 --> 00:20:25,402
Hurry up!

340
00:20:26,562 --> 00:20:27,242
Stop right there!

341
00:20:28,002 --> 00:20:28,482
Stop running!

342
00:20:29,802 --> 00:20:30,842
Careful.

343
00:20:32,482 --> 00:20:33,002
Stop right there!

344
00:20:51,322 --> 00:20:52,282
Let me catch my breath.

345
00:20:55,282 --> 00:20:56,922
What an exciting day.

346
00:20:57,082 --> 00:20:58,242
You look like an obedient student.

347
00:20:58,722 --> 00:21:00,042
I didn't expect you to be so cool.

348
00:21:00,362 --> 00:21:00,882
Why not?

349
00:21:01,322 --> 00:21:02,322
Are you looking down on good students?

350
00:21:02,722 --> 00:21:03,682
That's not true.

351
00:21:04,802 --> 00:21:05,722
Search the tunnel.

352
00:21:05,722 --> 00:21:06,922
They're here again. Let's go!

353
00:21:06,922 --> 00:21:08,282
Why are they still on our heels?

354
00:21:08,282 --> 00:21:09,122
There he is!

355
00:21:09,122 --> 00:21:10,362
There! Hurry up!

356
00:21:10,802 --> 00:21:12,442
Stop running! Stop!

357
00:21:12,842 --> 00:21:13,562
Stop!

358
00:21:16,522 --> 00:21:18,322
Here. Hurry up!

359
00:21:19,602 --> 00:21:20,602
This...

360
00:21:21,202 --> 00:21:21,962
Be careful.

361
00:21:25,042 --> 00:21:27,362
Stop right there!

362
00:21:27,362 --> 00:21:29,162
Where did they go? Stop right there!

363
00:21:31,042 --> 00:21:32,322
We lost them.

364
00:21:32,682 --> 00:21:35,402
Where did they go? Let's look around.

365
00:21:47,642 --> 00:21:48,562
We're finally safe.

366
00:21:49,042 --> 00:21:50,082
We've finally regained our freedom.

367
00:21:51,802 --> 00:21:52,922
Fate brought us together.

368
00:21:54,282 --> 00:21:55,162
Let's be friends.

369
00:21:57,322 --> 00:21:58,842
I thought we're already friends.

370
00:22:03,322 --> 00:22:04,082
Fine.

371
00:22:04,082 --> 00:22:05,282
I'll listen to you.

372
00:22:08,442 --> 00:22:09,442
It's getting late.

373
00:22:09,802 --> 00:22:10,722
I've got to go.

374
00:22:10,722 --> 00:22:11,842
I don't want to worry my family.

375
00:22:12,122 --> 00:22:12,722
Sure.

376
00:22:13,002 --> 00:22:14,922
I'll meet you at your class next time.

377
00:22:15,242 --> 00:22:15,922
You should go home now.

378
00:22:16,562 --> 00:22:17,722
Bye.

379
00:23:09,002 --> 00:23:09,962
What brings you here?

380
00:23:11,322 --> 00:23:12,082
Let's go.

381
00:23:24,962 --> 00:23:26,682
Are you here to look for me

382
00:23:27,082 --> 00:23:28,402
because you didn't see me at home?

383
00:23:28,842 --> 00:23:30,202
Do you know what time is it now?

384
00:23:31,122 --> 00:23:32,762
You should be more conscious
when living under someone else's roof.

385
00:23:32,762 --> 00:23:33,642
You'll worry others

386
00:23:33,642 --> 00:23:34,682
when you stay out late.

387
00:23:34,682 --> 00:23:35,762
It was all because of Liu Yin.

388
00:23:36,362 --> 00:23:38,042
She lied to me, saying that
you were going to have a rehearsal here.

389
00:23:38,042 --> 00:23:38,602
Otherwise,

390
00:23:38,602 --> 00:23:40,162
I wouldn't have stayed
in the field for such a long time.

391
00:23:40,162 --> 00:23:41,642
Why did you believe everything she said?

392
00:23:42,082 --> 00:23:43,562
I thought you had a clear head.

393
00:23:43,562 --> 00:23:44,242
Why didn't you verify

394
00:23:44,242 --> 00:23:45,322
her words?

395
00:23:45,322 --> 00:23:46,882
I didn't want to upset you.

396
00:23:47,202 --> 00:23:48,442
You are unpredictable.

397
00:23:48,642 --> 00:23:49,602
All I want to do now

398
00:23:49,602 --> 00:23:51,242
is to become a harmless animal

399
00:23:51,242 --> 00:23:52,722
and stay very quietly by your side
every day.

400
00:23:53,122 --> 00:23:54,802
I'm afraid that I might make a mistake

401
00:23:54,802 --> 00:23:55,882
and accidentally push your buttons.

402
00:23:55,882 --> 00:23:57,002
Then, not only will we
fail to be friends,

403
00:23:57,002 --> 00:23:58,402
we will also become enemies.

404
00:23:58,402 --> 00:23:59,162
Enough.

405
00:24:00,082 --> 00:24:00,882
Shut up.

406
00:24:01,482 --> 00:24:02,522
Why are you so talkative?

407
00:24:04,722 --> 00:24:06,522
Let me share
an interesting story with you.

408
00:24:06,522 --> 00:24:07,682
We did a physical examination
in school today,

409
00:24:07,682 --> 00:24:08,282
and I removed

410
00:24:08,282 --> 00:24:09,362
my tablemate's height insoles.

411
00:24:09,522 --> 00:24:10,082
He got his height measured,

412
00:24:10,082 --> 00:24:11,482
and he is
three centimeters shorter than before.

413
00:24:11,602 --> 00:24:13,722
- Also...
- Why are you so talkative? Shut up.

414
00:24:17,042 --> 00:24:17,722
What did you say?

415
00:24:19,682 --> 00:24:20,762
Why are you so talkative?

416
00:24:20,762 --> 00:24:21,322
The previous sentence.

417
00:24:22,082 --> 00:24:23,162
Shut up.

418
00:24:23,482 --> 00:24:24,882
Can you connect them?

419
00:24:25,562 --> 00:24:27,002
I'll shut up after you repeat it.

420
00:24:27,002 --> 00:24:28,162
Are you mad?

421
00:24:28,882 --> 00:24:30,242
It doesn't matter.

422
00:24:30,242 --> 00:24:31,322
Say it again, please.

423
00:24:31,562 --> 00:24:32,042
I won't.

424
00:24:32,042 --> 00:24:33,282
Just once.

425
00:24:33,802 --> 00:24:35,402
Just once.

426
00:24:36,602 --> 00:24:38,122
It won't hurt you.

427
00:24:38,682 --> 00:24:40,602
Just repeat the sentence
you said just now.

428
00:24:41,162 --> 00:24:43,602
Please. Just once.

429
00:24:45,682 --> 00:24:46,522
Good morning, Sir.

430
00:24:46,522 --> 00:24:47,242
Good morning.

431
00:24:47,362 --> 00:24:48,002
Good morning, Mr. Xie.

432
00:24:48,242 --> 00:24:48,722
Morning.

433
00:24:49,202 --> 00:24:49,802
Mr. Xie.

434
00:24:49,802 --> 00:24:50,362
Hello.

435
00:25:04,842 --> 00:25:06,642
Do you have a hidden agenda?

436
00:25:08,162 --> 00:25:09,802
No, I don't.

437
00:25:37,002 --> 00:25:38,402
You're quite good at fighting back.

438
00:25:38,962 --> 00:25:40,522
I only want to tell her

439
00:25:40,562 --> 00:25:42,522
that I'm not one to be trifled with.

440
00:25:55,242 --> 00:25:56,122
What are you laughing at?

441
00:25:58,922 --> 00:25:59,802
What's so funny?

442
00:26:03,082 --> 00:26:03,842
We'll now do a rehearsal

443
00:26:03,842 --> 00:26:05,162
for the public English class now.

444
00:26:05,842 --> 00:26:07,002
Don't make any mistakes tomorrow.

445
00:26:07,002 --> 00:26:07,842
Did you hear me?

446
00:26:08,002 --> 00:26:09,042
Yes.

447
00:26:16,762 --> 00:26:19,002
I'm a red blood cell, now...

448
00:26:21,802 --> 00:26:22,762
I will fight.

449
00:26:23,362 --> 00:26:24,962
I'm a red blood cell, now...

450
00:26:25,242 --> 00:26:26,282
I will fight.

451
00:26:28,682 --> 00:26:30,122
Why can't I memorize it?

452
00:26:32,602 --> 00:26:33,442
White Blood Cell.

453
00:26:33,602 --> 00:26:35,242
Thanks for saving us.

454
00:26:35,802 --> 00:26:36,922
The lines are in English.

455
00:26:37,322 --> 00:26:38,122
Miss Sun won't show you any mercy

456
00:26:38,122 --> 00:26:39,282
if you fail to memorize your lines.

457
00:26:39,522 --> 00:26:40,082
And of course,

458
00:26:40,202 --> 00:26:41,122
I won't let you go too.

459
00:26:42,642 --> 00:26:43,322
What do I do now?

460
00:26:43,842 --> 00:26:45,482
What do I do now?

461
00:26:53,082 --> 00:26:53,682
I'll just eat.

462
00:27:04,722 --> 00:27:06,202
Let's welcome Class One, Grade Two.

463
00:27:06,202 --> 00:27:08,522
They will present a sketch named
"Working Cell".

464
00:27:08,682 --> 00:27:10,122
Working Cell.

465
00:27:10,300 --> 00:27:12,180
(Working Cell)

466
00:27:17,842 --> 00:27:19,362
I'm a white blood cell.

467
00:27:19,562 --> 00:27:23,162
I'm responsible for removing
bacteria and virus

468
00:27:23,642 --> 00:27:26,922
that invade the body from the outside.

469
00:27:27,362 --> 00:27:30,322
I am Streptococcus pneumonia.

470
00:27:30,682 --> 00:27:33,442
My destructive power is very strong.

471
00:27:34,122 --> 00:27:34,962
What's the matter?

472
00:27:35,202 --> 00:27:36,602
I get an upset stomach
whenever I'm nervous.

473
00:27:36,962 --> 00:27:37,722
Are you all right?

474
00:27:38,402 --> 00:27:39,762
(It's neck and neck.)

475
00:27:39,762 --> 00:27:40,842
What do we do now?

476
00:27:40,842 --> 00:27:42,762
(Let the white blood cell's partner)

477
00:27:42,762 --> 00:27:44,562
(show up!)

478
00:27:46,442 --> 00:27:47,882
Where is Xie Ang?
Why isn't he here yet?

479
00:27:50,842 --> 00:27:51,562
Keep fighting.

480
00:27:54,162 --> 00:27:55,922
We're done for.
What if the audience gets bored of us?

481
00:27:56,562 --> 00:27:58,642
Xie Ang, can you
just hold on a little longer?

482
00:27:59,082 --> 00:28:00,242
I don't think so.

483
00:28:00,882 --> 00:28:01,962
I can't move at all.

484
00:28:03,202 --> 00:28:04,642
What do we do now?

485
00:28:22,202 --> 00:28:23,362
Set him free!

486
00:28:26,602 --> 00:28:27,722
Who are you?

487
00:28:28,722 --> 00:28:31,202
I'm the red blood cell
you're looking for.

488
00:28:36,922 --> 00:28:39,162
Now, I'll fight with you.

489
00:28:41,162 --> 00:28:43,802
Finally, the red blood cell is here.

490
00:28:44,362 --> 00:28:47,522
They will resume the battle.

491
00:29:14,282 --> 00:29:15,122
Watch out!

492
00:29:54,082 --> 00:29:55,802
Thank you for saving me.

493
00:30:07,162 --> 00:30:09,242
It was really close.

494
00:30:09,242 --> 00:30:11,162
My voice was trembling
when I was on the stage.

495
00:30:11,642 --> 00:30:14,082
Fortunately, we managed to complete it.

496
00:30:15,642 --> 00:30:18,442
How come you know Xie Ang's lines?

497
00:30:19,522 --> 00:30:21,522
I saw you
worrying about Xie Ang yesterday.

498
00:30:21,722 --> 00:30:23,082
So I thought
I should memorize his lines too.

499
00:30:23,402 --> 00:30:25,162
I only wanted to remind him
behind the stage.

500
00:30:25,762 --> 00:30:27,282
Little did I know

501
00:30:27,282 --> 00:30:28,602
it would actually come in handy.

502
00:30:29,762 --> 00:30:32,362
Thank you so much.

503
00:30:36,682 --> 00:30:37,402
What did you say?

504
00:30:39,642 --> 00:30:40,402
You heard it.

505
00:30:41,562 --> 00:30:43,202
I'm not hallucinating, am I?

506
00:30:44,082 --> 00:30:45,762
It's your first time
saying "thank you" to me.

507
00:30:46,202 --> 00:30:48,042
Does it mean
that I was actually helpful?

508
00:30:49,802 --> 00:30:51,042
Does it mean

509
00:30:51,042 --> 00:30:52,442
that we're one step closer
to being real friends?

510
00:30:54,162 --> 00:30:55,362
That's not what I meant.

511
00:30:57,642 --> 00:30:59,042
Since we aren't friends,

512
00:30:59,362 --> 00:31:00,042
a simple "thank you"

513
00:31:00,042 --> 00:31:01,482
won't be enough.

514
00:31:02,762 --> 00:31:03,802
What do you want?

515
00:31:11,282 --> 00:31:12,282
Buy me milk tea.

516
00:31:19,722 --> 00:31:21,042
Hello. Your drink is ready.

517
00:31:21,042 --> 00:31:21,562
Thank you.

518
00:31:21,562 --> 00:31:22,402
You're welcome.

519
00:31:26,962 --> 00:31:27,322
Here.

520
00:31:27,962 --> 00:31:28,882
The milk tea you asked for.

521
00:31:31,642 --> 00:31:32,842
Two cups?

522
00:31:33,162 --> 00:31:34,042
Thank you.

523
00:31:44,802 --> 00:31:45,922
Oolong without sugar.

524
00:31:46,882 --> 00:31:47,882
Pure milk.

525
00:31:49,522 --> 00:31:50,362
Tea and milk.

526
00:31:50,642 --> 00:31:52,122
That's the milk tea you were asking for.

527
00:31:53,282 --> 00:31:54,282
Ji Junxing.

528
00:31:54,682 --> 00:31:55,522
Are you doing this on purpose?

529
00:31:56,522 --> 00:31:57,642
Milk tea has a high content

530
00:31:57,642 --> 00:31:58,682
of trans fat,

531
00:31:58,682 --> 00:32:00,002
caffeine and fat.

532
00:32:00,282 --> 00:32:01,362
Too much milk tea

533
00:32:01,362 --> 00:32:03,042
will increase the risk
for cardiovascular diseases.

534
00:32:03,242 --> 00:32:04,442
It'll also make you gain weight.

535
00:32:04,642 --> 00:32:05,682
It will do you no good at all.

536
00:32:06,562 --> 00:32:08,522
I suggest you reduce
your milk tea intake.

537
00:32:09,002 --> 00:32:09,722
You're talking

538
00:32:09,722 --> 00:32:11,242
as if you're the expert
we see on the TV show.

539
00:32:11,322 --> 00:32:12,882
Thanks for your concern.

540
00:32:13,002 --> 00:32:14,122
But

541
00:32:14,122 --> 00:32:15,402
I want my milk tea now.

542
00:32:15,402 --> 00:32:16,602
Normal sugar,
with pearl and Nata de coco.

543
00:32:16,602 --> 00:32:18,042
I want grass jelly too.
I want every other add-on as well.

544
00:32:18,042 --> 00:32:19,482
My brother and I like it.

545
00:32:21,242 --> 00:32:22,202
Up to you.

546
00:32:24,122 --> 00:32:24,842
Ji Junxing.

547
00:32:26,202 --> 00:32:26,922
Wait.

548
00:32:27,802 --> 00:32:28,522
Ji Junxing.

549
00:32:52,122 --> 00:32:55,082
Do you like Crayon Shinchan too?

550
00:32:57,362 --> 00:32:58,282
Go away.
