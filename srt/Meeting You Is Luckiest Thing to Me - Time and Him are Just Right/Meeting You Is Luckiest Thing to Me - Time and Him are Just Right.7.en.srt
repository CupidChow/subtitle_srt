17
00:01:47,892 --> 00:01:48,852
It's just so-so.

18
00:01:50,012 --> 00:01:50,972
So-so?

19
00:01:51,572 --> 00:01:52,772
Give it back.

20
00:02:04,452 --> 00:02:06,332
(Snowy weather is hitting
many countries.)

21
00:02:06,332 --> 00:02:08,212
(The mountain and trees are
covered with snow.)

22
00:02:08,492 --> 00:02:10,452
(The first snow is expected
in near term in China.)

23
00:02:10,452 --> 00:02:13,372
(Please stay safe when going out.)

24
00:02:13,692 --> 00:02:15,132
It's very pretty.

25
00:02:18,732 --> 00:02:20,732
It's starting to snow
in the foreign countries.

26
00:02:21,692 --> 00:02:23,972
It looks like the first snow
of this year is approaching.

27
00:02:24,692 --> 00:02:26,332
I heard that if you make a wish

28
00:02:27,052 --> 00:02:29,052
on the day the first snow falls,

29
00:02:29,892 --> 00:02:31,732
the wish will be realized.

30
00:02:32,692 --> 00:02:33,452
You don't actually believe

31
00:02:33,452 --> 00:02:35,172
in such a childish urban legend,
do you?

32
00:02:37,132 --> 00:02:38,532
Don't you think it's romantic?

33
00:02:38,812 --> 00:02:39,772
Snow

34
00:02:39,772 --> 00:02:40,572
is just the crystal

35
00:02:40,572 --> 00:02:41,852
of water and condensation nucleus.

36
00:02:42,012 --> 00:02:43,092
It's a pure natural substance.

37
00:02:43,372 --> 00:02:44,372
It doesn't have superpowers.

38
00:02:44,372 --> 00:02:46,132
It can't grant wishes.

39
00:02:46,572 --> 00:02:47,292
Besides,

40
00:02:48,132 --> 00:02:49,812
the air quality has been poor lately.

41
00:02:49,972 --> 00:02:51,132
It might not be the romantic snow

42
00:02:51,132 --> 00:02:52,452
that falls from the sky

43
00:02:52,852 --> 00:02:54,212
but fine particulates.

44
00:02:56,692 --> 00:02:58,092
What a killjoy.

45
00:02:59,052 --> 00:03:00,092
But it's alright.

46
00:03:00,252 --> 00:03:01,812
Anyway, on the day
when the first snow falls,

47
00:03:01,812 --> 00:03:03,332
I'm going out for hotpot dinner.

48
00:03:03,892 --> 00:03:05,892
If Song Linxue asks to meet you,

49
00:03:06,092 --> 00:03:07,652
for the sake of your health,

50
00:03:07,772 --> 00:03:09,092
I don't mind sponsoring

51
00:03:09,092 --> 00:03:10,772
each of you for a gas mask.

52
00:03:10,772 --> 00:03:12,092
Then, you should buy a better one.

53
00:03:12,412 --> 00:03:13,532
I've found one recently.

54
00:03:13,732 --> 00:03:14,972
I'll send you the link later.

55
00:03:16,292 --> 00:03:17,972
I was just being courteous.

56
00:03:18,172 --> 00:03:19,372
I can't believe you take it seriously.

57
00:03:29,892 --> 00:03:30,612
- Mom.
- Aunt.

58
00:03:30,612 --> 00:03:32,012
- I'm going to school.
- I'm going to school.

59
00:03:33,932 --> 00:03:34,452
See!

60
00:03:34,452 --> 00:03:34,972
I told you.

61
00:03:34,972 --> 00:03:36,012
They live together.

62
00:03:36,012 --> 00:03:36,412
Meal card.

63
00:03:36,412 --> 00:03:37,092
Quick.

64
00:03:37,092 --> 00:03:37,612
What's going on?

65
00:03:37,612 --> 00:03:38,692
What are you guys doing here?

66
00:03:39,452 --> 00:03:40,932
It's you in the photo, isn't it?

67
00:03:42,972 --> 00:03:44,852
Lin Xi took the photo, right?

68
00:03:48,732 --> 00:03:50,412
Yesterday when you sent me
the compressed file of the photos

69
00:03:50,412 --> 00:03:51,332
of him and Song Linxue,

70
00:03:51,332 --> 00:03:52,572
you sent this over as well.

71
00:03:52,692 --> 00:03:54,972
This photo doesn't mean anything.

72
00:03:54,972 --> 00:03:56,572
It doesn't mean anything,

73
00:03:56,572 --> 00:03:57,332
but you came out

74
00:03:57,332 --> 00:03:58,572
of this door together.

75
00:03:58,572 --> 00:03:59,812
It's unusual.

76
00:04:00,212 --> 00:04:03,052
So what exactly is your relationship
with each other?

77
00:04:04,412 --> 00:04:05,772
Actually, we're just...

78
00:04:05,772 --> 00:04:07,372
We're just housemates.

79
00:04:08,452 --> 00:04:09,052
Xing,

80
00:04:09,452 --> 00:04:10,812
we've made several

81
00:04:10,812 --> 00:04:12,332
assumptions about your relationship.

82
00:04:12,332 --> 00:04:13,612
Now, we'd like to verify that.

83
00:04:14,172 --> 00:04:15,012
Let's hear it.

84
00:04:15,372 --> 00:04:16,692
The first possibility is

85
00:04:17,012 --> 00:04:18,412
you're siblings with different parents.

86
00:04:18,732 --> 00:04:19,972
The second possibility is

87
00:04:20,332 --> 00:04:22,292
it's a prenatal betrothal.

88
00:04:22,292 --> 00:04:23,492
The third possibility is

89
00:04:23,492 --> 00:04:25,572
you're long lost siblings.

90
00:04:25,572 --> 00:04:26,492
So which one are you?

91
00:04:27,412 --> 00:04:28,852
It has nothing to do with you.

92
00:04:29,092 --> 00:04:30,292
Can you stop being so nosy?

93
00:04:30,572 --> 00:04:31,932
Why does it have nothing to do with us?

94
00:04:32,092 --> 00:04:33,572
A squad is like a family.

95
00:04:33,612 --> 00:04:35,132
As a family, we should be honest
with each other.

96
00:04:35,132 --> 00:04:35,452
Right?

97
00:04:35,452 --> 00:04:36,252
That's right.

98
00:04:36,252 --> 00:04:37,852
Someone is trying to hide it from us.

99
00:04:37,852 --> 00:04:39,012
We can only guess about it.

100
00:04:39,012 --> 00:04:39,492
You...

101
00:04:39,492 --> 00:04:40,372
Stop guessing.

102
00:04:40,532 --> 00:04:41,772
None of that is true.

103
00:04:41,772 --> 00:04:43,452
Our parents happen to know each other.

104
00:04:43,452 --> 00:04:44,372
If anything,

105
00:04:44,372 --> 00:04:46,172
we're barely distant relatives.

106
00:04:46,412 --> 00:04:47,892
I just got transferred here
and had no place to live.

107
00:04:47,892 --> 00:04:49,252
His mom asked me to stay with them.

108
00:04:49,252 --> 00:04:50,052
That's all?

109
00:04:50,372 --> 00:04:53,092
That's pretty much

110
00:04:53,092 --> 00:04:53,812
it.

111
00:04:54,732 --> 00:04:55,852
I won't believe it.

112
00:04:55,932 --> 00:04:57,652
Then, I'll beat you to death.

113
00:04:58,772 --> 00:05:00,252
Stop her.

114
00:05:02,452 --> 00:05:04,172
(Attention, please.)

115
00:05:04,652 --> 00:05:05,692
(Here's the new arrangement)

116
00:05:05,692 --> 00:05:07,172
(that the school made.)

117
00:05:07,372 --> 00:05:09,652
(It's New Year's Day soon.)

118
00:05:09,772 --> 00:05:10,532
(Firstly,)

119
00:05:10,532 --> 00:05:12,132
(every class must actively participate)

120
00:05:12,132 --> 00:05:13,612
(in New Year's Blackboard Activity.)

121
00:05:13,932 --> 00:05:16,052
(The assessment will be conducted
on next Friday.)

122
00:05:16,212 --> 00:05:16,892
(Secondly,)

123
00:05:17,212 --> 00:05:19,452
(you'll have three days
of New Year Holiday.)

124
00:05:23,732 --> 00:05:24,412
See.

125
00:05:24,572 --> 00:05:25,932
The hot topic changes quickly.

126
00:05:26,092 --> 00:05:26,892
No one pays attention

127
00:05:26,892 --> 00:05:27,772
to us anymore.

128
00:05:27,932 --> 00:05:29,532
Shut up.

129
00:05:30,932 --> 00:05:31,772
Lin Xi.

130
00:05:54,332 --> 00:05:55,092
Well,

131
00:05:55,692 --> 00:05:56,972
I'd like to tell you

132
00:05:57,212 --> 00:05:58,972
that I'm just staying
at Ji Junxing's place.

133
00:06:00,252 --> 00:06:01,092
I know.

134
00:06:02,852 --> 00:06:03,772
Alright, then.

135
00:06:04,852 --> 00:06:05,692
Lin Xi,

136
00:06:07,332 --> 00:06:08,932
can you do me a favor?

137
00:06:09,732 --> 00:06:10,652
What is it?

138
00:06:16,820 --> 00:06:19,980
(Swan Lake Entry Ticket)

139
00:06:20,052 --> 00:06:21,292
Can you help me

140
00:06:21,932 --> 00:06:22,772
ask Ji Junxing

141
00:06:22,772 --> 00:06:24,852
to watch the show with me
on New Year's Day?

142
00:06:25,412 --> 00:06:26,852
Why don't you ask him yourself?

143
00:06:27,612 --> 00:06:28,812
I did.

144
00:06:29,172 --> 00:06:30,092
But I was rejected.

145
00:06:30,732 --> 00:06:33,612
He said he's got an appointment.

146
00:06:33,772 --> 00:06:34,652
An appointment?

147
00:06:34,652 --> 00:06:35,692
With whom?

148
00:06:36,572 --> 00:06:37,332
With you.

149
00:06:37,692 --> 00:06:38,452
Me?

150
00:06:39,092 --> 00:06:40,252
Why didn't I know that?

151
00:06:42,892 --> 00:06:43,532
I'm speechless.

152
00:06:43,892 --> 00:06:45,692
Ji Junxing must've used me
as his shield.

153
00:06:45,692 --> 00:06:47,092
I'm sure he won't go anywhere

154
00:06:47,092 --> 00:06:48,012
and will just stay at home.

155
00:06:48,452 --> 00:06:49,812
So you guys don't have a plan?

156
00:06:49,812 --> 00:06:50,732
No.

157
00:06:52,092 --> 00:06:52,852
Well,

158
00:06:53,732 --> 00:06:55,372
can you ask him out for me?

159
00:06:56,092 --> 00:06:56,852
I...

160
00:06:59,492 --> 00:07:00,532
Actually,

161
00:07:02,132 --> 00:07:03,932
I'm going abroad next semester.

162
00:07:04,972 --> 00:07:07,372
This is my last performance
before going abroad.

163
00:07:08,212 --> 00:07:09,572
Does Ji Junxing know that?

164
00:07:11,012 --> 00:07:12,092
No.

165
00:07:17,412 --> 00:07:18,772
We've known each other for eight years.

166
00:07:19,452 --> 00:07:21,092
We've never spent

167
00:07:21,092 --> 00:07:22,852
a festival together.

168
00:07:23,892 --> 00:07:25,572
Either I was competing in other cities,

169
00:07:25,972 --> 00:07:27,692
or he was occupied
with all kinds of things.

170
00:07:28,132 --> 00:07:29,452
We didn't get to spend time together.

171
00:07:30,412 --> 00:07:31,212
Ji Junxing

172
00:07:31,212 --> 00:07:32,972
is not good at making friends.

173
00:07:35,412 --> 00:07:36,252
But,

174
00:07:36,252 --> 00:07:37,932
why would you want

175
00:07:39,412 --> 00:07:41,372
to be friends with a loner like him?

176
00:07:49,852 --> 00:07:51,492
Because of a gummy bear.

177
00:08:03,772 --> 00:08:04,652
What's wrong with you?

178
00:08:04,652 --> 00:08:06,252
Why are you sitting here, crying?

179
00:08:07,812 --> 00:08:10,012
I lost the ballet competition.

180
00:08:10,492 --> 00:08:11,932
If my mom knows it,

181
00:08:11,932 --> 00:08:13,612
she'll scold me for sure.

182
00:08:13,852 --> 00:08:15,412
I don't want to go home.

183
00:08:19,332 --> 00:08:20,292
Are you hungry?

184
00:08:28,372 --> 00:08:29,012
Here.

185
00:08:29,652 --> 00:08:31,052
Do you like gummy bears?

186
00:08:31,652 --> 00:08:33,412
I bought it for my baby brother.

187
00:08:33,652 --> 00:08:35,292
But he can't eat it as he's too little.

188
00:08:36,092 --> 00:08:38,292
My mom doesn't allow me to eat sweets.

189
00:08:38,292 --> 00:08:39,252
I'll get fat.

190
00:08:40,492 --> 00:08:41,412
It's alright.

191
00:08:41,412 --> 00:08:42,932
Just eat one at a time.

192
00:09:01,652 --> 00:09:02,972
It's sweet, isn't it?

193
00:09:04,172 --> 00:09:04,852
It's really sweet.

194
00:09:05,212 --> 00:09:05,932
Thank you.

195
00:09:06,732 --> 00:09:07,612
You're welcome.

196
00:09:16,292 --> 00:09:19,052
So I always wanted to thank him.

197
00:09:20,092 --> 00:09:20,972
Does he know that?

198
00:09:22,092 --> 00:09:23,852
I guess not.

199
00:09:25,852 --> 00:09:29,172
So I'd like to spend
New Year's Day with him

200
00:09:30,212 --> 00:09:33,732
at least once before I go abroad.

201
00:09:34,692 --> 00:09:36,732
To account for the past few years.

202
00:09:39,892 --> 00:09:40,612
Lin Xi,

203
00:09:42,452 --> 00:09:43,732
can you help me with that?

204
00:09:55,732 --> 00:09:56,492
You're back.

205
00:10:14,620 --> 00:10:15,460
(Swan Lake Entry Ticket)

206
00:10:15,492 --> 00:10:16,172
What is this for?

207
00:10:16,172 --> 00:10:17,412
You want to invite me to a show?

208
00:10:17,772 --> 00:10:18,892
Not me.

209
00:10:18,892 --> 00:10:19,812
It's Song Linxue.

210
00:10:20,372 --> 00:10:21,212
Song Linxue?

211
00:10:21,572 --> 00:10:22,652
I've rejected her.

212
00:10:23,172 --> 00:10:24,692
Why did you do that?

213
00:10:24,692 --> 00:10:26,372
And why did you use me as your shield?

214
00:10:26,372 --> 00:10:27,612
I'm afraid she'll feel hurt

215
00:10:27,612 --> 00:10:28,452
if I tell her the truth.

216
00:10:29,212 --> 00:10:30,292
I'll fall asleep

217
00:10:30,292 --> 00:10:31,452
when the show starts.

218
00:10:31,692 --> 00:10:33,052
I went to watch her show once.

219
00:10:33,252 --> 00:10:35,052
I was asleep throughout the entire show.

220
00:10:35,772 --> 00:10:37,212
It's unexpected

221
00:10:37,452 --> 00:10:38,892
that you have no artistic potential.

222
00:10:39,772 --> 00:10:41,732
I can't help it.
It's a physiological response.

223
00:10:43,292 --> 00:10:44,572
This is different.

224
00:10:44,572 --> 00:10:46,372
This is her last performance
before going abroad.

225
00:10:46,612 --> 00:10:47,972
As this is an important occasion,

226
00:10:47,972 --> 00:10:49,892
it's inappropriate for me
to go there and sleep.

227
00:10:50,572 --> 00:10:51,292
Besides,

228
00:10:51,532 --> 00:10:52,252
I have things

229
00:10:52,252 --> 00:10:53,732
to do on New Year's Day.

230
00:10:57,372 --> 00:10:58,252
You sure?

231
00:10:59,532 --> 00:11:00,412
I'm not going.

232
00:11:14,772 --> 00:11:15,892
Wait, guys.

233
00:11:16,612 --> 00:11:17,892
One more thing.

234
00:11:18,292 --> 00:11:19,332
New Year is coming.

235
00:11:19,332 --> 00:11:21,012
Our school holds
a blackboard assessment.

236
00:11:21,452 --> 00:11:22,332
Ji Junxing,

237
00:11:22,732 --> 00:11:24,092
you'll organize this activity.

238
00:11:24,372 --> 00:11:25,372
Noted, Miss Sun.

239
00:11:25,732 --> 00:11:26,732
The schedule is tight.

240
00:11:27,292 --> 00:11:28,892
You can find a student to help you.

241
00:11:28,892 --> 00:11:30,212
Is there any volunteer?

242
00:11:37,012 --> 00:11:37,932
Miss Sun,

243
00:11:37,932 --> 00:11:39,892
I volunteer to draw it with Ji Junxing.

244
00:11:40,532 --> 00:11:41,612
With your lousy drawing skill,

245
00:11:41,612 --> 00:11:42,372
are you sure about it?

246
00:11:42,372 --> 00:11:43,772
Just be grateful you have my help.

247
00:11:43,772 --> 00:11:44,532
How dare you be so picky?

248
00:11:45,452 --> 00:11:46,892
Okay, I'll leave it to you two.

249
00:11:47,012 --> 00:11:48,532
If you win the first place,

250
00:11:48,532 --> 00:11:49,692
the class will be awarded.

251
00:11:49,972 --> 00:11:50,572
Work harder.

252
00:11:50,852 --> 00:11:51,412
Noted.

253
00:11:51,612 --> 00:11:52,132
Class dismissed.

254
00:12:14,572 --> 00:12:15,772
Do you think we can win

255
00:12:15,772 --> 00:12:16,732
the first place?

256
00:12:17,092 --> 00:12:18,012
It was less likely to win.

257
00:12:18,012 --> 00:12:18,812
Now, you're in it.

258
00:12:19,092 --> 00:12:20,092
It's virtually impossible.

259
00:12:20,092 --> 00:12:21,892
Don't be so pessimistic.

260
00:12:22,172 --> 00:12:23,732
We've had chemistry as partners.

261
00:12:23,732 --> 00:12:25,332
I'm sure this will make things better.

262
00:12:28,132 --> 00:12:28,732
Well,

263
00:12:29,532 --> 00:12:32,292
if I help you win the first place,

264
00:12:32,732 --> 00:12:34,132
can you go

265
00:12:34,132 --> 00:12:35,692
to the New Year's date with Song Linxue?

266
00:12:37,332 --> 00:12:38,692
It turns out that your help

267
00:12:38,692 --> 00:12:39,532
is a bait.

268
00:12:39,532 --> 00:12:40,932
You're waiting for me to take it.

269
00:12:41,652 --> 00:12:43,252
Don't put it that way.

270
00:12:43,452 --> 00:12:44,892
I was entrusted by her.

271
00:12:45,092 --> 00:12:46,092
Besides, I like

272
00:12:46,092 --> 00:12:47,132
to help people.

273
00:12:47,452 --> 00:12:48,852
Helping you with the blackboard design

274
00:12:48,852 --> 00:12:49,972
and fulfilling her wish,

275
00:12:49,972 --> 00:12:51,212
it's a good thing for everyone.

276
00:12:51,372 --> 00:12:52,612
Love and peace.

277
00:12:53,652 --> 00:12:55,052
Fine, Benevolent Lin.

278
00:12:55,532 --> 00:12:56,852
But there's one thing

279
00:12:56,852 --> 00:12:58,172
that you might not be aware of.

280
00:12:59,172 --> 00:13:00,092
Do you know

281
00:13:00,092 --> 00:13:01,492
why they didn't volunteer for this?

282
00:13:02,492 --> 00:13:03,332
Why?

283
00:13:04,372 --> 00:13:05,972
Because Art Class is always the winner

284
00:13:05,972 --> 00:13:07,252
of each year's blackboard assessment.

285
00:13:07,652 --> 00:13:09,212
Defeating them to be the winner is

286
00:13:09,492 --> 00:13:11,212
a dream that's hard to achieve.

287
00:13:16,932 --> 00:13:17,652
Okay.

288
00:13:18,972 --> 00:13:19,572
Hang in there.

289
00:13:24,980 --> 00:13:30,660
(Unremitting self-improvement,
the unity of knowing and doing)

290
00:13:38,892 --> 00:13:40,412
Creating artworks requires inspirations.

291
00:13:40,812 --> 00:13:41,972
Allow me to go out and seek for it.

292
00:13:49,332 --> 00:13:51,012
Actually, I've seen her drawing.

293
00:13:51,612 --> 00:13:52,212
Look.

294
00:13:52,892 --> 00:13:53,972
It's quite unique.

295
00:14:02,572 --> 00:14:03,692
It's boldly colored.

296
00:14:03,852 --> 00:14:04,772
And it's pretty creative.

297
00:14:05,932 --> 00:14:07,292
You can understand it?

298
00:14:07,452 --> 00:14:08,932
Why don't you transfer to Art Class?

299
00:14:11,452 --> 00:14:12,532
You've promised

300
00:14:12,532 --> 00:14:13,412
Miss Sun.

301
00:14:13,412 --> 00:14:15,092
If you come last in the contest,

302
00:14:15,092 --> 00:14:16,892
it'd fly in the face of what you said.

303
00:14:19,572 --> 00:14:20,772
What should we do now?

304
00:14:36,612 --> 00:14:37,932
You freak me out.

305
00:14:38,612 --> 00:14:40,412
Why are you sneaking up

306
00:14:40,412 --> 00:14:41,652
on my class?

307
00:14:41,972 --> 00:14:42,772
Do you miss me?

308
00:14:44,852 --> 00:14:46,012
I heard your class get the first place

309
00:14:46,012 --> 00:14:47,132
for each year's blackboard assessment.

310
00:14:47,372 --> 00:14:49,132
So I'm here to spy on you guys.

311
00:14:49,252 --> 00:14:50,092
Don't.

312
00:14:50,092 --> 00:14:51,132
Just because of this?

313
00:14:51,132 --> 00:14:52,052
How's thing going?

314
00:14:52,052 --> 00:14:53,252
I haven't seen it yet.

315
00:14:54,532 --> 00:14:56,492
Do you know
why the height of the hurdler

316
00:14:56,492 --> 00:14:58,052
will be raised slowly?

317
00:14:59,172 --> 00:14:59,772
Why?

318
00:15:00,292 --> 00:15:00,932
Because

319
00:15:00,932 --> 00:15:02,652
if it's the height of Mount Everest,

320
00:15:02,652 --> 00:15:03,932
our confidence would be ruined.

321
00:15:04,092 --> 00:15:05,052
So,

322
00:15:05,332 --> 00:15:07,092
I suggest you
not to look at our blackboard.

323
00:15:08,332 --> 00:15:08,972
Don't worry.

324
00:15:08,972 --> 00:15:10,132
I have strong confidence.

325
00:15:10,132 --> 00:15:10,732
Move aside.

326
00:15:10,852 --> 00:15:11,452
Not a chance.

327
00:15:11,972 --> 00:15:13,692
You've been trained for ten years.

328
00:15:13,692 --> 00:15:14,892
I only have three days to do this.

329
00:15:17,292 --> 00:15:18,412
Stop peeking on it.

330
00:15:21,772 --> 00:15:23,172
My new shoes.

331
00:15:32,972 --> 00:15:33,852
Are you alright?

332
00:15:34,212 --> 00:15:35,252
Is there any confidence left now?

333
00:15:35,612 --> 00:15:36,172
It's all gone.

334
00:15:43,132 --> 00:15:44,452
I'll find a way to help you.

335
00:15:44,812 --> 00:15:46,092
Don't be sad.

336
00:15:58,292 --> 00:15:58,932
Lin Xi.

337
00:16:03,172 --> 00:16:04,892
I've found a way to help you
win the first place.

338
00:16:04,972 --> 00:16:05,812
What is it?

339
00:16:05,932 --> 00:16:06,572
On the assessment day,

340
00:16:06,572 --> 00:16:07,532
I'll ask Black Bull and the others

341
00:16:07,532 --> 00:16:08,972
to erase the other classes' blackboards.

342
00:16:08,972 --> 00:16:09,852
What do you think?

343
00:16:10,412 --> 00:16:11,532
Why don't you just blow the school up?

344
00:16:12,332 --> 00:16:12,932
I was just kidding.

345
00:16:12,932 --> 00:16:13,652
It was a joke.

346
00:16:14,492 --> 00:16:15,812
Get on. I'll take you home.

347
00:16:16,212 --> 00:16:18,092
This is my new scooter, Bumble Bee.

348
00:16:18,092 --> 00:16:19,532
No one has sat on the backseat before.

349
00:16:20,132 --> 00:16:21,212
Come on. Try it.

350
00:16:21,212 --> 00:16:22,332
I save it specially for you.

351
00:16:24,412 --> 00:16:25,612
This is so cute.

352
00:16:25,612 --> 00:16:27,132
I got this helmet
specially for you as well.

353
00:16:27,292 --> 00:16:27,892
Get on.

354
00:16:29,052 --> 00:16:30,012
I'll take you home.

355
00:16:32,172 --> 00:16:34,012
Do you know "first come, first serve"?

356
00:16:34,012 --> 00:16:35,532
There's a saying that
relationship is more important.

357
00:16:35,812 --> 00:16:36,692
We're going in the same direction

358
00:16:36,932 --> 00:16:37,572
as we live together.

359
00:16:40,332 --> 00:16:40,972
Lin Xi,

360
00:16:41,092 --> 00:16:43,012
I'll be faster than him
even if I take a detour.

361
00:16:43,012 --> 00:16:43,852
Come, get on.

362
00:16:45,012 --> 00:16:46,172
Don't get on a random ride.

363
00:16:46,172 --> 00:16:47,452
Be aware of dangers.

364
00:16:53,292 --> 00:16:54,772
A poem suddenly occurs to me.

365
00:16:56,252 --> 00:16:58,492
I'm letting loose my youthful spirit.

366
00:16:58,492 --> 00:17:01,012
A yellow dog on my left,
and a falcon on my right.

367
00:17:01,812 --> 00:17:02,772
If you don't let go now,

368
00:17:02,772 --> 00:17:04,212
I'll sweep over ridge
with thousand riders.

369
00:17:06,012 --> 00:17:07,052
You're childish.

370
00:17:08,972 --> 00:17:09,732
Lin Xi.

371
00:17:14,412 --> 00:17:15,212
Lin Xi.

372
00:17:27,572 --> 00:17:29,932
Can you stop putting your legs
on the floor?

373
00:17:30,092 --> 00:17:30,932
You're bad at riding scooter.

374
00:17:30,932 --> 00:17:32,132
How dare you blame me
for having long legs?

375
00:17:32,572 --> 00:17:34,292
Can't you see the footplate?

376
00:17:34,892 --> 00:17:35,652
Put them there.

377
00:17:44,492 --> 00:17:45,852
Wait for us.

378
00:17:45,932 --> 00:17:46,932
Faster.

379
00:17:47,052 --> 00:17:48,292
You can't even catch up with me.

380
00:18:05,732 --> 00:18:06,812
Not bad.

381
00:18:06,812 --> 00:18:08,812
Your relationship advanced
by leaps along the way.

382
00:18:09,252 --> 00:18:10,532
There's something

383
00:18:10,532 --> 00:18:12,332
we need to take care of.

384
00:18:13,252 --> 00:18:14,812
I'm not interested in him.

385
00:18:15,292 --> 00:18:16,412
Just take care of it yourself.

386
00:18:23,452 --> 00:18:24,372
Bye bye.

387
00:18:49,452 --> 00:18:51,012
What are you looking at?
You look serious.

388
00:18:51,372 --> 00:18:52,492
The atlas of blackboard.

389
00:18:52,492 --> 00:18:53,812
I borrowed it from the school library.

390
00:18:54,012 --> 00:18:55,892
The successive blackboard posters are
on it.

391
00:18:55,892 --> 00:18:57,172
I use it as a reference.

392
00:18:59,012 --> 00:19:00,052
You take it so seriously.

393
00:19:01,292 --> 00:19:02,452
I take everything seriously.

394
00:19:03,532 --> 00:19:04,932
Okay, keep it up.

395
00:19:19,652 --> 00:19:21,172
That's my water.

396
00:19:22,172 --> 00:19:23,172
Sorry.

397
00:19:36,772 --> 00:19:37,212
Mom,

398
00:19:37,732 --> 00:19:39,132
why are there only two sets
of breakfast?

399
00:19:39,132 --> 00:19:39,972
Where's Lin Xi's?

400
00:19:40,972 --> 00:19:42,052
She went out before dawn.

401
00:19:42,052 --> 00:19:43,412
She said she went to draw
blackboard poster.

402
00:19:47,572 --> 00:19:48,772
Aren't you going to eat?

403
00:19:49,212 --> 00:19:50,212
I'll eat at school.

404
00:21:39,092 --> 00:21:40,412
With this skill of yours,

405
00:21:40,732 --> 00:21:42,412
you even want to win the first place?

406
00:21:52,092 --> 00:21:54,692
It's okay
if we don't get the first place.

407
00:22:02,732 --> 00:22:04,532
Those who finish
iodine clock reaction experiment

408
00:22:04,532 --> 00:22:05,972
can wash the equipments.

409
00:22:06,412 --> 00:22:07,532
You're dismissed

410
00:22:08,132 --> 00:22:09,172
after that.

411
00:22:09,572 --> 00:22:11,412
You must be careful.

412
00:22:11,412 --> 00:22:14,292
Thank you, Sir.

413
00:22:15,692 --> 00:22:17,732
Hey, get me the CPPO

414
00:22:17,732 --> 00:22:21,452
and Dibutyl Phthalate.

415
00:22:26,372 --> 00:22:27,612
This is distilled water.

416
00:22:28,412 --> 00:22:29,372
Find it yourself.

417
00:22:36,420 --> 00:22:37,640
(Confidence fulfills dreams)

418
00:22:37,732 --> 00:22:39,372
Fluorescent Amyloid.

419
00:22:41,372 --> 00:22:42,452
It's old-fashioned

420
00:22:42,932 --> 00:22:44,532
and matched with fancy color.

421
00:22:44,852 --> 00:22:46,692
Why isn't there anything new?

422
00:22:48,892 --> 00:22:50,332
You don't have solid basic skills.

423
00:22:50,332 --> 00:22:51,412
Yet, you're into
something advanced.

424
00:22:51,692 --> 00:22:53,332
Beware of going off the deep end.

425
00:22:58,492 --> 00:22:59,332
I got an idea.

426
00:23:00,492 --> 00:23:01,172
What?

427
00:23:01,812 --> 00:23:03,292
Do you know Rare Earth Phosphor?

428
00:23:30,972 --> 00:23:32,012
It's very pretty.

429
00:23:32,132 --> 00:23:33,212
Come check it out.

430
00:23:40,452 --> 00:23:41,292
It's quite bright.

431
00:23:42,012 --> 00:23:43,012
Does it look nice?

432
00:23:43,812 --> 00:23:44,452
Yes, it does.

433
00:23:50,172 --> 00:23:51,212
Well, then.

434
00:23:51,212 --> 00:23:52,332
You continue.

435
00:24:20,892 --> 00:24:22,932
It also looks nice like this.

436
00:24:24,812 --> 00:24:25,772
Are you ready?

437
00:24:26,012 --> 00:24:27,572
It's the moment of truth.

438
00:24:27,572 --> 00:24:28,332
Faster.

439
00:24:30,012 --> 00:24:32,852
Three, two, one.

440
00:24:37,412 --> 00:24:39,252
This is spectacular.

441
00:24:49,692 --> 00:24:51,532
It looks great, doesn't it?

442
00:24:53,812 --> 00:24:55,092
I didn't expect that.

443
00:24:57,732 --> 00:25:00,012
Perhaps

444
00:25:00,252 --> 00:25:01,692
we could win the first place.

445
00:25:04,812 --> 00:25:06,652
You can sell me out
if we win the first place.

446
00:25:08,652 --> 00:25:09,212
What's wrong?

447
00:25:09,772 --> 00:25:11,292
You feel sorry now?

448
00:25:12,932 --> 00:25:14,852
No, I don't.

449
00:25:17,172 --> 00:25:18,812
I'm creating opportunity for you.

450
00:25:18,972 --> 00:25:20,252
Thank you.

451
00:25:43,132 --> 00:25:44,972
(Notice about the selection of school grades')
The selection result is as below.

452
00:25:44,972 --> 00:25:45,212
(New Year theme blackboard posters)

453
00:25:45,212 --> 00:25:46,852
(New Year theme blackboard posters)
Class One, Grade Two won the first place.

454
00:25:48,652 --> 00:25:49,772
Class Three is in second place.

455
00:25:49,772 --> 00:25:51,132
Class Ten is in third place.

456
00:25:51,692 --> 00:25:54,172
Qin Kai from Class 12 is
given a demerit.

457
00:25:54,172 --> 00:25:56,500
(Qin Kai from Class 12 is
given a demerit.)

458
00:25:57,932 --> 00:25:59,852
Qin Kai betrayed his class.

459
00:26:00,412 --> 00:26:01,212
What do you mean?

460
00:26:01,572 --> 00:26:02,772
Don't you know that?

461
00:26:03,092 --> 00:26:04,572
He changed his class's blackboard poster

462
00:26:04,572 --> 00:26:05,852
into a pighead.

463
00:26:05,972 --> 00:26:07,692
He ceded the first place to us.

464
00:26:08,292 --> 00:26:09,252
We can't care so much.

465
00:26:09,252 --> 00:26:10,292
Anyway, we're in the first place.

466
00:26:11,052 --> 00:26:12,132
New Year's Holiday is coming.

467
00:26:12,132 --> 00:26:13,212
Do you have any plan?

468
00:26:13,372 --> 00:26:15,332
I'll most probably stay at home.

469
00:26:15,652 --> 00:26:17,092
Then, can I join you?

470
00:26:17,252 --> 00:26:18,012
No.

471
00:26:19,852 --> 00:26:20,772
What about you, Xing?

472
00:26:22,372 --> 00:26:25,012
He's got a date on New Year's Day.

473
00:26:25,412 --> 00:26:26,292
With whom?

474
00:26:32,172 --> 00:26:33,132
With whom?

475
00:26:43,652 --> 00:26:44,372
Lin Xi.

476
00:26:44,972 --> 00:26:46,372
Ji Junxing has a date on New Year's Day.

477
00:26:46,372 --> 00:26:48,132
Isn't this what you want?

478
00:26:48,292 --> 00:26:50,452
Why would you feel upset?

479
00:26:52,532 --> 00:26:54,092
Why would I feel upset?

480
00:26:55,852 --> 00:26:57,932
Why would I feel upset?

481
00:26:57,932 --> 00:26:59,972
Why? Why?

482
00:27:04,612 --> 00:27:05,572
Who is it?

483
00:27:05,892 --> 00:27:07,012
Do you have time tomorrow?

484
00:27:07,012 --> 00:27:08,692
Go buy a New Year's gift with me.

485
00:27:10,092 --> 00:27:12,212
Okay, I'll go the extra miles with him.

486
00:27:34,812 --> 00:27:35,732
What about this?

487
00:27:36,732 --> 00:27:37,892
It's too red.

488
00:27:37,892 --> 00:27:39,252
It looks like Red Riding Hood.

489
00:27:40,612 --> 00:27:41,572
It looks nice.

490
00:27:46,452 --> 00:27:46,972
This one.

491
00:27:47,692 --> 00:27:48,332
What do you think?

492
00:27:48,572 --> 00:27:49,812
It feels soft.

493
00:27:50,692 --> 00:27:51,492
It's too white.

494
00:27:51,492 --> 00:27:52,692
Like the white silk.

495
00:27:56,892 --> 00:27:59,172
This bear must be the right choice.

496
00:27:59,852 --> 00:28:01,372
This is the problem.

497
00:28:01,532 --> 00:28:02,492
Those who suck at buying gifts

498
00:28:02,492 --> 00:28:03,252
will choose a bear.

499
00:28:03,252 --> 00:28:04,492
This is a corny choice.

500
00:28:05,292 --> 00:28:06,252
Fine, then.

501
00:28:06,452 --> 00:28:07,972
You help me pick the right gift.

502
00:28:14,012 --> 00:28:15,612
This is very cute.

503
00:28:15,612 --> 00:28:16,812
It's ugly but adorable.

504
00:28:16,812 --> 00:28:18,052
It's adorable but droll.

505
00:28:18,052 --> 00:28:19,172
Its aura is unique.

506
00:28:19,172 --> 00:28:20,332
I like it.

507
00:28:25,652 --> 00:28:26,772
What kind of choice is this?

508
00:28:26,772 --> 00:28:27,532
Your aesthetic

509
00:28:27,532 --> 00:28:28,932
preferences are very unique.

510
00:28:31,852 --> 00:28:32,612
Right.

511
00:28:32,932 --> 00:28:33,972
My preferences are

512
00:28:33,972 --> 00:28:35,332
totally different from hers.

513
00:28:36,012 --> 00:28:37,532
Just ignore

514
00:28:37,772 --> 00:28:39,132
what I like.

515
00:28:40,652 --> 00:28:42,132
As my personal advice,

516
00:28:42,292 --> 00:28:44,332
you should choose some elegant
and premium stuff.

517
00:28:44,332 --> 00:28:45,372
It's more secure.

518
00:28:47,572 --> 00:28:48,492
You go ahead.

519
00:28:48,492 --> 00:28:49,572
I'll wait for you out there.

520
00:29:11,252 --> 00:29:12,812
(Dear viewers,)

521
00:29:12,812 --> 00:29:14,012
(Happy New Year.)

522
00:29:14,372 --> 00:29:16,092
(Based on our station's
weather observation,)

523
00:29:16,092 --> 00:29:17,772
(our city will embrace the first snow)

524
00:29:17,772 --> 00:29:19,212
(of this year today.)

525
00:29:19,212 --> 00:29:20,292
(The temperature drops abruptly.)

526
00:29:20,532 --> 00:29:22,172
(Please stay warm.)

527
00:29:22,172 --> 00:29:23,452
It's such a good weather.

528
00:29:23,972 --> 00:29:25,652
How could it possibly snow?

529
00:29:27,572 --> 00:29:28,972
The weather is quite nice today.

530
00:29:29,052 --> 00:29:30,012
It's a good time to go out.

531
00:29:30,572 --> 00:29:31,932
Would you like to take a walk with me?

532
00:29:33,932 --> 00:29:34,412
No, thanks.

533
00:29:34,612 --> 00:29:36,132
I don't want to be a third wheel.

534
00:29:38,252 --> 00:29:40,892
Besides, Jiang Yimian is waiting for me
at the hotpot restaurant.

535
00:29:41,092 --> 00:29:42,812
I've got to go to her now.

536
00:29:42,812 --> 00:29:44,132
Are you going out in that outfit?

537
00:29:48,812 --> 00:29:50,532
I'm going to get dressed.

538
00:29:50,972 --> 00:29:52,092
Just leave now.

539
00:29:52,532 --> 00:29:53,412
Don't be late.

540
00:29:53,412 --> 00:29:55,012
It's not nice to keep her waiting.

541
00:29:55,812 --> 00:29:56,772
Have fun.

542
00:30:44,972 --> 00:30:46,452
(It's New Year again.)

543
00:30:46,452 --> 00:30:47,972
(It's time to ring out
the old, in the new.)

544
00:30:47,972 --> 00:30:49,172
(I wonder if you've bidden)

545
00:30:49,172 --> 00:30:51,732
(farewell to the past year
without regret.)

546
00:30:52,212 --> 00:30:54,532
(If you're brave enough)

547
00:30:54,532 --> 00:30:56,612
(to meet the people
who you want to see.)

548
00:30:56,612 --> 00:30:59,572
(To do something you want to
but you've never done.)

549
00:31:43,732 --> 00:31:44,692
You're here.

550
00:31:45,892 --> 00:31:47,292
Don't you have to stand by?

551
00:31:47,292 --> 00:31:48,092
Why are you here?

552
00:31:48,932 --> 00:31:49,372
As you're coming,

553
00:31:49,372 --> 00:31:50,492
I certainly have to wait for you.

554
00:31:51,972 --> 00:31:53,732
Is this bouquet of flowers for me?

555
00:31:54,012 --> 00:31:54,612
Yes.

556
00:31:55,052 --> 00:31:56,092
Have a great show.

557
00:31:57,492 --> 00:31:58,172
Thank you.

558
00:31:58,932 --> 00:32:00,172
I like the flowers.

559
00:32:00,492 --> 00:32:01,372
Well, let's go.

560
00:32:02,812 --> 00:32:03,612
Where to?

561
00:32:05,572 --> 00:32:06,772
Come with me. You'll know it.

562
00:32:07,772 --> 00:32:08,492
No.

563
00:32:08,972 --> 00:32:10,252
The show is about to start.

564
00:32:10,372 --> 00:32:11,212
Don't waste your time.

565
00:32:14,932 --> 00:32:16,412
There's no show at all.

566
00:32:18,492 --> 00:32:19,412
There's no show?

567
00:32:19,692 --> 00:32:22,052
In order to spend
the New Year's Day with you,

568
00:32:22,052 --> 00:32:23,892
I lied.

569
00:32:25,612 --> 00:32:27,812
I thought today was
your farewell performance.

570
00:32:28,812 --> 00:32:30,012
If that's the case,

571
00:32:30,812 --> 00:32:31,652
I'll get going

572
00:32:31,972 --> 00:32:32,732
as I have things to do.

573
00:32:35,172 --> 00:32:36,972
Aren't you curious

574
00:32:36,972 --> 00:32:38,732
why I'd lie

575
00:32:38,972 --> 00:32:39,772
to ask you out

576
00:32:39,772 --> 00:32:41,292
to spend the New Year's Day with you?

577
00:32:43,092 --> 00:32:43,812
Why?

578
00:32:47,972 --> 00:32:49,252
Do you still remember

579
00:32:50,172 --> 00:32:51,772
the gummy bear you gave me

580
00:32:52,652 --> 00:32:54,852
on the New Year's Day eight years ago?

581
00:32:59,412 --> 00:33:00,732
You might not know this.

582
00:33:01,172 --> 00:33:03,532
That gummy bear is very important

583
00:33:04,012 --> 00:33:05,252
to me.

584
00:33:10,652 --> 00:33:12,412
My mom sent me to every city

585
00:33:12,412 --> 00:33:13,332
to learn dancing.

586
00:33:13,932 --> 00:33:15,572
All those years of competition,

587
00:33:17,372 --> 00:33:19,532
it reminded me of you when I saw

588
00:33:21,292 --> 00:33:22,612
the gummy bear.

589
00:33:25,092 --> 00:33:27,292
This gave me the courage to move on.

590
00:33:31,572 --> 00:33:32,412
Xue,

591
00:33:35,092 --> 00:33:37,452
you really are
a very important friend to me.

592
00:33:40,412 --> 00:33:41,132
I mean it.

593
00:33:46,012 --> 00:33:47,492
Now that you know it.

594
00:33:48,852 --> 00:33:51,132
Will you still give me
gummy bears in future?

595
00:33:59,732 --> 00:34:00,692
You have to believe

596
00:34:01,652 --> 00:34:03,332
that one day, you'll meet a guy.

597
00:34:04,372 --> 00:34:05,692
He'll give you stuff which is

598
00:34:05,692 --> 00:34:07,332
more precious than the gummy bears.

599
00:34:08,372 --> 00:34:08,932
He'll remember

600
00:34:08,932 --> 00:34:10,772
every moment he spends with you.

601
00:34:11,252 --> 00:34:12,452
He'll make you laugh,

602
00:34:12,932 --> 00:34:14,212
and give you warmth.

603
00:34:21,252 --> 00:34:22,652
I got it.

604
00:34:24,132 --> 00:34:24,852
Xue.

605
00:34:24,852 --> 00:34:25,772
You can go.

606
00:34:29,212 --> 00:34:30,332
Happy New Year.

607
00:35:03,572 --> 00:35:04,532
Mianmian,

608
00:35:04,532 --> 00:35:05,652
I've ordered a lot of food.

609
00:35:05,652 --> 00:35:07,052
There are beef, tripe, and quail eggs.

610
00:35:07,172 --> 00:35:08,252
Are you sure you're not coming?

611
00:35:08,612 --> 00:35:09,412
Do you really have

612
00:35:09,412 --> 00:35:10,692
the heart to leave me alone

613
00:35:10,692 --> 00:35:12,492
during New Year's Day?

614
00:35:13,132 --> 00:35:14,452
I'd like to come too.

615
00:35:14,452 --> 00:35:16,092
Who knew that Xie Ang, the trash,

616
00:35:16,092 --> 00:35:17,412
didn't get me out of here.

617
00:35:17,412 --> 00:35:18,772
He himself even got trapped here.

618
00:35:19,132 --> 00:35:20,852
Both of us are being
strictly watched

619
00:35:20,852 --> 00:35:21,852
and doing homework now.

620
00:35:21,852 --> 00:35:23,052
We're more miserable than you.

621
00:35:23,452 --> 00:35:25,412
What kind of foolish thing
has Xie Ang done?

622
00:35:26,372 --> 00:35:28,252
He introduced himself
to my mom when he came.

623
00:35:28,252 --> 00:35:29,892
He said he's the son
of the Dean of Student.

624
00:35:29,892 --> 00:35:31,532
My mom was fascinated.

625
00:35:31,532 --> 00:35:33,172
She thought he was a Math expert.

626
00:35:33,172 --> 00:35:34,732
She asked him
to help me with homework.

627
00:35:34,732 --> 00:35:36,132
I didn't do it on purpose.

628
00:35:36,132 --> 00:35:36,692
If I didn't say

629
00:35:36,692 --> 00:35:38,252
I'm the son of the Dean of Student,

630
00:35:38,252 --> 00:35:39,532
your mom would think we're couple

631
00:35:39,532 --> 00:35:40,652
and kick me out of here.

632
00:35:42,452 --> 00:35:43,492
You must be tired.

633
00:35:43,652 --> 00:35:44,652
My mom is here. I'm hanging up.

634
00:35:45,172 --> 00:35:45,772
Hello?

635
00:35:49,052 --> 00:35:50,132
Have some fruits.

636
00:35:51,892 --> 00:35:52,932
Thank you, Aunt.

637
00:35:53,492 --> 00:35:54,292
You're welcome.

638
00:35:54,292 --> 00:35:55,772
Continue after eating fruits.

639
00:35:55,772 --> 00:35:56,212
Sure.

640
00:35:59,612 --> 00:36:00,652
Did I ask you to eat it?

641
00:36:12,540 --> 00:36:13,460
(Moments)

642
00:36:13,460 --> 00:36:15,740
(Gao Yunlang Playing games)

643
00:36:15,740 --> 00:36:17,220
(Qin Kai Playing basketball
to loosen up)

644
00:36:20,172 --> 00:36:21,372
I'm envious.

645
00:36:21,580 --> 00:36:25,660
(Liu Yin Holiday is another form
of study day)

646
00:36:25,972 --> 00:36:27,812
All of them have companions.

647
00:36:29,972 --> 00:36:31,172
I'll eat it myself.

648
00:36:32,732 --> 00:36:33,852
It's snowing.

649
00:36:44,932 --> 00:36:46,332
It's really snowing.

650
00:36:46,812 --> 00:36:47,532
The weather broadcast

651
00:36:47,532 --> 00:36:49,052
didn't lie this time.

652
00:36:54,412 --> 00:36:55,492
I wish

653
00:36:56,172 --> 00:36:58,372
that my family and Ji Junxing could be

654
00:36:59,892 --> 00:37:01,292
safe and sound,

655
00:37:02,212 --> 00:37:03,732
and everything will be well.

656
00:37:05,852 --> 00:37:06,452
Come.

657
00:37:07,172 --> 00:37:09,212
To the coming year.

658
00:37:10,572 --> 00:37:11,852
