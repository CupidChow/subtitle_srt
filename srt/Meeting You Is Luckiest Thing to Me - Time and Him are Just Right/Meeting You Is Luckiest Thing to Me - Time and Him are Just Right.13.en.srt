00:07:04,360 --> 00:07:05,200
It is late.

173
00:07:06,720 --> 00:07:07,600
But I want

174
00:07:07,600 --> 00:07:09,120
to seize my final year
to give it a shot.

175
00:07:10,760 --> 00:07:11,800
You mean

176
00:07:12,280 --> 00:07:14,400
you want to gamble with your final year?

177
00:07:15,480 --> 00:07:16,680
What if

178
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:18,360
you lose?

179
00:07:21,640 --> 00:07:23,560
The business school
is not the best solution

180
00:07:23,560 --> 00:07:25,120
but we have done all
the groundwork for it.

181
00:07:27,080 --> 00:07:28,560
But Jinghua University's
Computer Science Faculty

182
00:07:29,760 --> 00:07:31,320
is where my desire lies.

183
00:07:48,320 --> 00:07:49,120
So?

184
00:07:49,520 --> 00:07:51,160
Do I get to have the ice cream?

185
00:07:53,200 --> 00:07:54,240
I guess not.

186
00:07:55,640 --> 00:07:57,160
Come. Let's have ice cream!

187
00:08:07,960 --> 00:08:08,640
So

188
00:08:08,920 --> 00:08:10,320
your mom agrees to let you pursue
computer science?

189
00:08:11,440 --> 00:08:12,600
Why was she against it?

190
00:08:14,640 --> 00:08:16,160
You will have my support.

191
00:08:18,800 --> 00:08:19,960
Don't get ahead of yourself.

192
00:08:20,400 --> 00:08:22,240
Your father won't be
that easily convinced.

193
00:08:22,680 --> 00:08:23,480
You know very well

194
00:08:23,840 --> 00:08:25,400
the effort he put in

195
00:08:25,400 --> 00:08:27,240
to send you to the business school.

196
00:08:27,880 --> 00:08:29,360
You have to promise me one thing.

197
00:08:30,040 --> 00:08:31,520
I want you to be prepared
for all eventualities.

198
00:08:32,560 --> 00:08:34,200
Finish what you have to do on your side

199
00:08:34,520 --> 00:08:35,720
before you talk to him.

200
00:08:36,280 --> 00:08:37,600
At the moment,

201
00:08:37,880 --> 00:08:39,080
I won't tell him.

202
00:08:39,480 --> 00:08:40,080
Okay?

203
00:08:41,800 --> 00:08:43,120
They want me to study business.

204
00:08:44,400 --> 00:08:47,200
So you want to start your own business?

205
00:08:48,080 --> 00:08:49,480
No, I'll be inheriting
my family business.

206
00:08:49,760 --> 00:08:51,200
I didn't know your family

207
00:08:51,200 --> 00:08:52,520
has a business empire.

208
00:08:53,200 --> 00:08:55,040
So what's your plan then?

209
00:08:55,960 --> 00:08:57,040
Do you want to attend the winter camp

210
00:08:57,040 --> 00:08:58,080
of Jinghua University with me?

211
00:08:59,280 --> 00:08:59,800
No.

212
00:09:00,480 --> 00:09:02,040
I will turn to the provincial team coach

213
00:09:02,400 --> 00:09:03,720
and ask if I can be reinstated.

214
00:09:06,240 --> 00:09:07,080
All the best.

215
00:09:07,480 --> 00:09:08,680
I hope I don't have to wait so long

216
00:09:08,680 --> 00:09:09,920
that I become your senior
at Jinghua University.

217
00:09:10,760 --> 00:09:11,880
Maybe you'll be my junior.

218
00:09:12,320 --> 00:09:13,720
I beg your pardon?

219
00:09:25,520 --> 00:09:26,080
Mianmian.

220
00:09:26,840 --> 00:09:28,320
Come take a stroll with me.

221
00:09:28,640 --> 00:09:29,800
It's so stuffy in here.

222
00:09:30,640 --> 00:09:31,920
I don't think I can.

223
00:09:32,440 --> 00:09:33,680
The science subjects
from three days ago,

224
00:09:33,680 --> 00:09:34,520
math from the day before yesterday,

225
00:09:34,520 --> 00:09:35,600
and yesterday's English.

226
00:09:35,840 --> 00:09:37,120
I won't be able to finish them.

227
00:09:37,560 --> 00:09:38,600
That's a lot.

228
00:09:38,880 --> 00:09:40,520
I thought they only gave
us Chinese today.

229
00:09:45,320 --> 00:09:46,520
Oh my god.

230
00:09:46,520 --> 00:09:47,840
Another Chinese paper.

231
00:09:48,680 --> 00:09:49,560
I'm done for.

232
00:09:51,080 --> 00:09:52,320
I'll go alone then.

233
00:09:54,920 --> 00:09:55,680
Lin Xi.

234
00:10:00,320 --> 00:10:01,320
Hush.

235
00:10:01,320 --> 00:10:02,600
Everyone is studying.

236
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:03,760
What?

237
00:10:05,480 --> 00:10:06,200
Miss Lin Xi.

238
00:10:06,440 --> 00:10:07,760
You are cordially invited

239
00:10:07,760 --> 00:10:09,120
to my award ceremony.

240
00:10:09,920 --> 00:10:10,920
Is it like a grand event?

241
00:10:11,240 --> 00:10:12,160
It even comes with an invitation card?

242
00:10:12,960 --> 00:10:13,720
Open it.

243
00:10:17,120 --> 00:10:19,740
(Miss Lin Xi, you are cordially invited
to the award ceremony)

244
00:10:21,200 --> 00:10:22,840
Miss Lin Xi, you are cordially invited

245
00:10:22,840 --> 00:10:24,840
to the award ceremony of Mr. Qin Kai

246
00:10:24,840 --> 00:10:25,960
for the Provincial High School

247
00:10:25,960 --> 00:10:26,720
Men 110 Meters Hurdles

248
00:10:26,720 --> 00:10:28,280
Tournament.

249
00:10:29,880 --> 00:10:31,200
The tournament is a bit of a mouthful

250
00:10:31,640 --> 00:10:32,920
but that sounds impressive.

251
00:10:32,920 --> 00:10:33,720
Which medal did you get?

252
00:10:34,320 --> 00:10:35,640
I'll get whichever medal

253
00:10:35,640 --> 00:10:36,680
you want me to get.

254
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:37,920
You can do that?

255
00:10:38,600 --> 00:10:39,960
A smart student can decide
how high he scores

256
00:10:39,960 --> 00:10:41,120
and I can decide which medal I get.

257
00:10:41,120 --> 00:10:41,680
Do you believe me?

258
00:10:42,360 --> 00:10:42,880
I do.

259
00:10:43,320 --> 00:10:44,920
Bring me a gold medal then.

260
00:10:44,920 --> 00:10:46,560
Show me what you have.

261
00:10:46,560 --> 00:10:47,680
No problem.

262
00:10:48,200 --> 00:10:48,680
Besides,

263
00:10:48,680 --> 00:10:50,160
the tournament is on home turf.

264
00:10:50,440 --> 00:10:51,560
If you can be there,

265
00:10:51,560 --> 00:10:53,360
that will be the biggest support
I can ever ask for.

266
00:10:53,760 --> 00:10:55,080
All right. I'll be there.

267
00:10:55,440 --> 00:10:56,160
We have a deal?

268
00:10:57,480 --> 00:10:59,960
(Miss Lin Xi, you are cordially invited
to the award ceremony)

269
00:11:00,200 --> 00:11:02,393
(Yuezhou Province 5th High School
Track and Field Tournament)

270
00:11:02,680 --> 00:11:03,519
(No.3 High School)

271
00:11:03,520 --> 00:11:06,080
(Men 110 Meters Hurdles Event)

272
00:11:06,080 --> 00:11:07,160
(will begin soon.)

273
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:09,800
(Athletes, please get in position.)

274
00:11:11,320 --> 00:11:13,000
Huang Bin will win!

275
00:11:13,600 --> 00:11:15,280
Ready.

276
00:11:15,520 --> 00:11:16,320
(Qin Kai)

277
00:11:21,560 --> 00:11:22,320
Set.

278
00:11:36,280 --> 00:11:39,280
You can do it, Huang Bin!

279
00:11:39,280 --> 00:11:40,720
Huang Bin is about to take the lead!

280
00:11:41,360 --> 00:11:43,600
Qin Kai! Run faster!

281
00:11:43,600 --> 00:11:44,960
You are the best.

282
00:11:45,240 --> 00:11:47,040
The gold medal is yours!

283
00:11:47,040 --> 00:11:49,320
Go!

284
00:11:49,840 --> 00:11:51,400
You can do it, Qin Kai!

285
00:11:55,320 --> 00:11:56,980
(Qin Kai)

286
00:12:02,040 --> 00:12:03,560
Qin Kai won!

287
00:12:06,200 --> 00:12:08,467
(1st: Qin Kai, 2nd: Huang Bin)

288
00:12:10,400 --> 00:12:11,600
Congratulations, Huang Bin.

289
00:12:17,200 --> 00:12:17,840
Congratulations.

290
00:12:18,160 --> 00:12:18,960
Come. Let's shake hands.

291
00:12:21,520 --> 00:12:22,320
(Qin Kai)

292
00:12:23,920 --> 00:12:25,120
Qin Kai!

293
00:12:33,560 --> 00:12:34,480
Look. I took these photos.

294
00:12:34,880 --> 00:12:36,040
Where am I?

295
00:12:36,600 --> 00:12:37,720
Here.

296
00:12:38,680 --> 00:12:39,280
Look.

297
00:12:39,640 --> 00:12:40,320
If you didn't point it out,

298
00:12:40,320 --> 00:12:42,520
I would have thought
these people were just spectators.

299
00:12:42,840 --> 00:12:44,320
Do you know how many people
were in front of me?

300
00:12:44,320 --> 00:12:45,280
Finding an angle was so hard.

301
00:12:45,600 --> 00:12:46,520
And this photo.

302
00:12:46,520 --> 00:12:47,560
I had to keep jumping

303
00:12:47,560 --> 00:12:48,480
to capture it.

304
00:12:48,960 --> 00:12:51,440
Isn't it easy to look for an angle?

305
00:12:54,400 --> 00:12:54,960
See?

306
00:12:55,480 --> 00:12:57,000
I found the right angle.

307
00:12:57,280 --> 00:12:59,560
The angle, the lighting, and the shots.

308
00:12:59,560 --> 00:13:00,760
They are perfect.

309
00:13:00,760 --> 00:13:01,840
I couldn't pose in time.

310
00:13:01,840 --> 00:13:02,640
My eyes were closed.

311
00:13:02,640 --> 00:13:03,680
Retake it.

312
00:13:03,960 --> 00:13:05,920
A candid shot

313
00:13:05,920 --> 00:13:07,000
is more meaningful.

314
00:13:07,280 --> 00:13:09,800
I will save it for memory's sake.

315
00:13:10,800 --> 00:13:11,560
Sent.

316
00:13:12,720 --> 00:13:13,360
Your gold medal

317
00:13:13,360 --> 00:13:14,880
is more meaningful than those
ugly photos of me.

318
00:13:15,760 --> 00:13:18,280
Then you can have my gold medal.

319
00:13:18,280 --> 00:13:19,040
Take it.

320
00:13:19,040 --> 00:13:19,880
We're even now.

321
00:13:21,040 --> 00:13:22,520
You worked so hard for it

322
00:13:22,520 --> 00:13:23,720
and now, you're giving it to me?

323
00:13:24,360 --> 00:13:25,720
Because you're worth it.

324
00:13:27,040 --> 00:13:28,480
You're the reason why

325
00:13:28,480 --> 00:13:29,640
I got the gold medal.

326
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:30,920
How so?

327
00:13:31,880 --> 00:13:34,200
When you started yelling like that,

328
00:13:34,200 --> 00:13:35,600
you scared my opponents.

329
00:13:35,920 --> 00:13:37,720
They froze for 0.1 second.

330
00:13:37,720 --> 00:13:38,840
And that helped a lot.

331
00:13:38,840 --> 00:13:39,800
Therefore, you can have it.

332
00:13:40,840 --> 00:13:41,600
Fine.

333
00:13:42,040 --> 00:13:43,200
I'll take it.

334
00:13:43,600 --> 00:13:44,280
Thank you.

335
00:13:46,160 --> 00:13:49,320
Maybe after I return
from my intensive training,

336
00:13:49,320 --> 00:13:51,160
I can give you another gold medal
with higher gold purity?

337
00:13:51,160 --> 00:13:51,880
Sure.

338
00:13:53,880 --> 00:13:54,560
Wait.

339
00:13:54,560 --> 00:13:56,040
Intensive training?

340
00:13:56,640 --> 00:13:57,200
Yes.

341
00:13:57,560 --> 00:13:59,680
I have to stay in another province
for six months.

342
00:14:00,160 --> 00:14:01,200
That's so long.

343
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:04,720
You'll only be back next semester then.

344
00:14:05,120 --> 00:14:06,760
Why? You'll miss me?

345
00:14:06,760 --> 00:14:08,480
Tell me how much you miss me

346
00:14:08,480 --> 00:14:09,720
and I might just stay.

347
00:14:10,200 --> 00:14:11,320
No.

348
00:14:11,320 --> 00:14:12,240
If you stay,

349
00:14:12,240 --> 00:14:12,920
you can't give me

350
00:14:12,920 --> 00:14:14,360
another gold medal
of higher gold purity.

351
00:14:15,160 --> 00:14:16,560
Now that you put it that way,

352
00:14:16,560 --> 00:14:17,360
I have

353
00:14:17,360 --> 00:14:18,760
to win a national gold medal then.

354
00:14:18,760 --> 00:14:20,240
Like a medal that doesn't
hurt your teeth

355
00:14:20,240 --> 00:14:21,080
when you bite it.

356
00:14:22,800 --> 00:14:23,360
Okay.

357
00:14:24,320 --> 00:14:26,040
If you come back with a gold medal,
I'll bite it,

358
00:14:26,360 --> 00:14:27,360
even if it hurts my teeth.

359
00:14:27,760 --> 00:14:28,760
That's a deal then?

360
00:14:29,840 --> 00:14:31,080
That's a deal.

361
00:14:35,080 --> 00:14:35,960
This is a good photo.

362
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:55,800
What are you doing?

363
00:14:58,480 --> 00:15:00,640
Spacing out.

364
00:15:02,160 --> 00:15:04,400
You don't look okay.

365
00:15:05,040 --> 00:15:05,640
What's wrong?

366
00:15:07,720 --> 00:15:09,720
I'm off to a bad start.

367
00:15:10,320 --> 00:15:11,920
I didn't get to pass the quiz,

368
00:15:12,320 --> 00:15:14,640
so the coach rejected me.

369
00:15:17,440 --> 00:15:18,600
International Olympiad in Informatics.

370
00:15:18,960 --> 00:15:20,240
Be prepared for it.

371
00:15:20,560 --> 00:15:21,640
All of you

372
00:15:22,080 --> 00:15:23,640
will remain in the computer room
and practice hard.

373
00:15:23,880 --> 00:15:24,600
Understood?

374
00:15:24,880 --> 00:15:26,080
Yes, sir.

375
00:15:32,640 --> 00:15:33,520
Hi, Mr. Xu.

376
00:15:33,880 --> 00:15:34,840
Ji Junxing?

377
00:15:36,040 --> 00:15:37,840
It's been a while
since you left the team.

378
00:15:39,160 --> 00:15:39,800
Sir.

379
00:15:39,800 --> 00:15:40,720
I want

380
00:15:40,960 --> 00:15:42,080
to come back.

381
00:15:42,080 --> 00:15:43,080
You want to come back?

382
00:15:46,360 --> 00:15:47,880
You didn't train for the last two years.

383
00:15:47,880 --> 00:15:48,960
Coming back now

384
00:15:48,960 --> 00:15:50,160
is impossible.

385
00:15:52,640 --> 00:15:53,360
Sir,

386
00:15:53,880 --> 00:15:54,960
I've been teaching myself

387
00:15:54,960 --> 00:15:55,960
for the past two years.

388
00:15:56,760 --> 00:15:57,840
Perhaps you can give me a chance?

389
00:15:58,400 --> 00:15:59,200
You want a chance?

390
00:16:01,320 --> 00:16:01,920
Sure.

391
00:16:04,160 --> 00:16:05,280
Tell me the two solutions

392
00:16:05,800 --> 00:16:06,800
to the last question.

393
00:16:14,560 --> 00:16:16,560
(Task Description, Formatting)

394
00:16:28,200 --> 00:16:29,200
How difficult can it be?

395
00:16:29,600 --> 00:16:30,200
Let me see.

396
00:16:31,800 --> 00:16:33,480

Weighted graph?

398
00:16:36,280 --> 00:16:38,120
What is this foreign language?

399
00:16:41,400 --> 00:16:43,320
Sorry.

400
00:16:43,600 --> 00:16:44,680
I underestimated its difficulty.

401
00:16:49,840 --> 00:16:52,320
What do you plan to do now?

402
00:16:53,080 --> 00:16:53,960
What else can I do?

403
00:16:54,760 --> 00:16:56,200
I'll keep going at it

404
00:16:56,560 --> 00:16:58,000
until I solve it.

405
00:16:58,400 --> 00:16:59,880
I have to change his mind.

406
00:17:05,600 --> 00:17:06,520
Sorry.

407
00:17:07,200 --> 00:17:09,000
I can only give you moral support.

408
00:17:12,640 --> 00:17:13,480
All the best.

409
00:17:27,040 --> 00:17:29,120
I'm giving back
your monthly exam papers.

410
00:17:29,760 --> 00:17:31,440

the same questions wrong.

He is the perfect example

00:20:29,960 --> 00:20:31,680
his behavior is unusual lately.

462
00:20:31,680 --> 00:20:32,880
He leaves every evening.

463
00:20:32,880 --> 00:20:34,080
Do you know what he is doing?

464
00:20:37,800 --> 00:20:40,760
He is doing something big.

465
00:20:40,760 --> 00:20:41,680
Like what?

466
00:20:44,280 --> 00:20:46,560
He wants to get back to
the provincial programming team

467
00:20:46,800 --> 00:20:48,280
and obtain a gold medal in
International Olympiad in Informatics.

That is if this gem

471
00:20:59,480 --> 00:21:00,080
manages

472
00:21:00,080 --> 00:21:01,520
to get through Mr. Xu.

473
00:21:02,040 --> 00:21:03,640
He did catch up to others' progress

474
00:21:03,840 --> 00:21:05,440
but Mr. Xu won't change his mind

475
00:21:05,600 --> 00:21:07,040
and is avoiding him.

476
00:21:07,640 --> 00:21:08,480
So?

477
00:21:08,720 --> 00:21:09,640
Let's stake out

478
00:21:09,640 --> 00:21:10,360
and wait for him to appear.

479
00:21:14,840 --> 00:21:16,480
A bold idea just came to my mind.

480
00:21:19,080 --> 00:21:21,200
We will flank him

481
00:21:21,200 --> 00:21:22,240
from both sides...

482
00:21:29,320 --> 00:21:30,080
Mr. Xu.

483
00:21:30,880 --> 00:21:32,160
You again?

484
00:21:33,040 --> 00:21:34,320
I already told you

485
00:21:34,640 --> 00:21:35,800
that you couldn't leave

486
00:21:35,800 --> 00:21:37,080
and rejoin the team as you wish.

487
00:21:37,560 --> 00:21:38,200
Sir.

488
00:21:38,480 --> 00:21:39,440
I'm not asking you

489
00:21:39,440 --> 00:21:41,000
to give me a shortcut.

490
00:21:41,640 --> 00:21:43,320
I want you to give me another chance.

491
00:21:45,080 --> 00:21:47,120
I already gave you one

492
00:21:47,440 --> 00:21:48,920
but you missed it.

493
00:21:50,120 --> 00:21:51,560
When you were in Grade 10,
you were on the team

494
00:21:51,880 --> 00:21:53,200
and I had high expectations of you.

495
00:21:53,520 --> 00:21:54,520
But you...

496
00:21:55,160 --> 00:21:56,280
You said something happened
to your family.

497
00:21:56,640 --> 00:21:58,320
You started skipping classes

498
00:21:58,320 --> 00:21:59,960
and even stopped showing up completely.

499
00:22:00,560 --> 00:22:01,200
Sir.

500
00:22:02,280 --> 00:22:04,280
My brother was having
a heart transplant.

501
00:22:04,600 --> 00:22:06,080
I had to look after him

502
00:22:06,720 --> 00:22:07,800
so I had to quit the team.

503
00:22:10,960 --> 00:22:11,640
All right now.

504
00:22:13,080 --> 00:22:13,960
You have a valid reason

505
00:22:14,640 --> 00:22:16,000
but you're too far behind

506
00:22:16,520 --> 00:22:18,040
from what I want now.

507
00:22:19,280 --> 00:22:19,880
Sir.

508
00:22:20,200 --> 00:22:21,960
I already solved the question
you gave me.

509
00:22:22,520 --> 00:22:23,000
During the past two weeks,

510
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:24,720
I also went through the past

511
00:22:24,720 --> 00:22:25,720
Olympiad questions.

512
00:22:26,640 --> 00:22:27,800
Can you test me again?

513
00:22:28,640 --> 00:22:29,640
I have seen

514
00:22:29,960 --> 00:22:31,200
what you were capable of last time.

515
00:22:31,760 --> 00:22:33,040
Let's not waste each other's time.

516
00:22:40,920 --> 00:22:41,840
What are you doing?

517
00:22:42,040 --> 00:22:44,400
Sorry, Mr. Xu.

518
00:22:44,520 --> 00:22:46,360
Please give him a chance

519
00:22:46,600 --> 00:22:47,800
or you might not be allowed to leave.

520
00:22:48,960 --> 00:22:50,240
You're in the same class, aren't you?

521
00:22:51,120 --> 00:22:53,040
What if I bring this
to your home teacher?

522
00:22:53,920 --> 00:22:54,600
Mr. Xu.

523
00:22:54,600 --> 00:22:56,240
Once you give Ji Junxing another chance,

524
00:22:56,240 --> 00:22:57,240
you can punish us as you see fit.

525
00:23:01,960 --> 00:23:03,680
He studies till late every day

526
00:23:03,680 --> 00:23:04,720
and he works very hard.

527
00:23:04,720 --> 00:23:06,160
Please give him another chance.

528
00:23:06,400 --> 00:23:07,160
I agree.

529
00:23:10,320 --> 00:23:11,800
Impressive.

530
00:23:14,760 --> 00:23:15,640
You planned the whole thing?

531
00:23:17,040 --> 00:23:18,720
Sir, it was us who planned it.

532
00:23:18,720 --> 00:23:19,720
It has nothing to do with him.

533
00:23:21,080 --> 00:23:23,720
Mr. Xu, they are my friends

534
00:23:24,160 --> 00:23:25,520
but I had no idea they were doing this.

535
00:23:29,320 --> 00:23:31,160
You guys have great teamwork.

536
00:23:34,240 --> 00:23:37,000
Do you want another chance that badly?

537
00:23:38,040 --> 00:23:38,760
Mr. Xu,

538
00:23:39,080 --> 00:23:40,400
if I get accepted
back to the team this time,

539
00:23:40,800 --> 00:23:42,080
I will spend the rest of my life

540
00:23:42,080 --> 00:23:44,200
making up for my previous mistake.

541
00:23:47,280 --> 00:23:47,880
Fine.

542
00:23:49,040 --> 00:23:50,080
I'll give you a question now.

543
00:23:50,320 --> 00:23:51,200
Hurry up.

544
00:23:55,440 --> 00:23:56,720
Wow.

545
00:23:56,720 --> 00:23:58,360
You even prepared a chair and a desk.

546
00:24:02,160 --> 00:24:03,040
Show me

547
00:24:03,480 --> 00:24:05,240
what you have got.

548
00:24:13,760 --> 00:24:15,523
(Male)

549
00:24:19,040 --> 00:24:20,320
My friend,

550
00:24:20,600 --> 00:24:21,840
the toilet is broken.

551
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:23,120
Just go to the one upstairs.

552
00:24:23,880 --> 00:24:24,760
You want some tissue paper?

553
00:24:25,200 --> 00:24:25,960
No, thanks.

554
00:24:27,720 --> 00:24:28,720
Why aren't they out yet?

555
00:24:28,760 --> 00:24:29,600
The test

556
00:24:29,600 --> 00:24:30,720
takes way too long to finish.

557
00:24:30,720 --> 00:24:32,040
They can stay in there
for all they want.

558
00:24:32,400 --> 00:24:33,040
Who knew

559
00:24:33,040 --> 00:24:33,760
that the toilet entrance

560
00:24:33,760 --> 00:24:34,440
would be a lucrative corner

561
00:24:34,440 --> 00:24:35,920
for my business?

562
00:24:35,920 --> 00:24:37,000
I sold many tissue papers today.

563
00:24:38,640 --> 00:24:39,800
You're crazy.

564
00:24:40,280 --> 00:24:42,440
I'm a good salesperson.

565
00:24:42,440 --> 00:24:43,320
You won't understand.

566
00:24:45,200 --> 00:24:46,320
They are out now.

567
00:24:47,840 --> 00:24:48,840
So?

568
00:24:48,840 --> 00:24:49,520
Are they done?

569
00:24:57,000 --> 00:24:58,000
I will think about it.

570
00:24:59,400 --> 00:25:00,240
Thanks, Mr. Xu.

571
00:25:03,800 --> 00:25:04,720
No more next time.

572
00:25:05,160 --> 00:25:06,600
- No more next time.
- No more next time.

573
00:25:07,400 --> 00:25:08,480
Bunch of troublemakers.

574
00:25:10,040 --> 00:25:10,920
See you, Mr. Xu.

575
00:25:12,520 --> 00:25:14,120
- So?
- So?

576
00:25:14,240 --> 00:25:15,080
How did it go?

577
00:25:23,200 --> 00:25:24,280
Qin Kai, are you done?

578
00:25:24,280 --> 00:25:25,160
You're the only one left.

579
00:25:25,160 --> 00:25:25,880
Almost there.

580
00:25:38,720 --> 00:25:40,280
Kai, I searched around.

581
00:25:40,280 --> 00:25:41,280
Lin Xi isn't in her classroom.

582
00:25:43,400 --> 00:25:44,360
Hold this for me.

583
00:26:01,640 --> 00:26:02,560
I saw

584
00:26:02,760 --> 00:26:04,040
Mr. Xu smile just now.

585
00:26:04,280 --> 00:26:05,520
I think you're in.

586
00:26:05,520 --> 00:26:06,320
I think you are in.

587
00:26:06,680 --> 00:26:08,400
We shall have
an early celebratory meal then.

588
00:26:08,400 --> 00:26:09,080
Xing, treat us!

589
00:26:09,080 --> 00:26:09,880
Buffet!

590
00:26:09,880 --> 00:26:10,320
Yes!

591
00:26:10,320 --> 00:26:11,920
You sure are cheeky enough
to ask for a free meal.

592
00:26:16,280 --> 00:26:17,680
Qin Kai, are you leaving or not?

593
00:26:21,120 --> 00:26:22,840
Kai, let me put your luggage in.

594
00:26:39,400 --> 00:26:40,960
Kai, we need to go now.

595
00:26:49,320 --> 00:26:50,240
Qin Kai.

596
00:26:57,240 --> 00:26:58,760
You're leaving this soon?

597
00:26:59,040 --> 00:27:00,800
Yes. The bus is waiting for me.

598
00:27:01,400 --> 00:27:02,520
This is for you.

599
00:27:03,320 --> 00:27:04,800
The bunny ears

600
00:27:04,800 --> 00:27:05,800
have sprouted.

601
00:27:06,160 --> 00:27:07,600
It looks like a pair of bunny ears.

602
00:27:09,760 --> 00:27:11,240
Aren't they in the boiler room?

603
00:27:11,240 --> 00:27:12,280
How did you get them out?

604
00:27:12,880 --> 00:27:14,840
I scaled the wall.

605
00:27:17,640 --> 00:27:18,680
So

606
00:27:18,680 --> 00:27:20,240
you dirtied your jersey

607
00:27:20,440 --> 00:27:21,720
for these Monilaria moniliformis seeds?

608
00:27:23,720 --> 00:27:24,640
It's no big deal.

609
00:27:25,480 --> 00:27:27,600
But I might have broken the ears

610
00:27:27,600 --> 00:27:29,440
when I was scaling the wall.

611
00:27:33,560 --> 00:27:34,240
It's okay.

612
00:27:34,240 --> 00:27:35,120
Now, it looks like a pair
of droopy bunny ears.

613
00:27:38,200 --> 00:27:39,680
Kai, time to leave.

614
00:27:40,360 --> 00:27:40,960
Go now.

615
00:27:40,960 --> 00:27:41,960
I'll leave then.

616
00:27:41,960 --> 00:27:42,520
Bye.

617
00:27:42,680 --> 00:27:43,240
Bye.

618
00:27:49,040 --> 00:27:50,840
Call me and text me!

619
00:27:50,840 --> 00:27:51,640
Don't worry.

620
00:27:51,640 --> 00:27:52,360
Train hard

621
00:27:52,360 --> 00:27:53,840
and get me a national gold medal!

622
00:27:58,200 --> 00:27:59,320
Don't forget!

623
00:28:55,720 --> 00:28:56,080
Hurry up.

624
00:28:56,080 --> 00:28:57,160
Help me take this.

625
00:28:58,440 --> 00:28:59,520
It's so heavy today.

626
00:28:59,720 --> 00:29:00,760
After the previous stakeout,

627
00:29:00,760 --> 00:29:02,360
Ji Junxing invested 500 yuan in us.

628
00:29:02,360 --> 00:29:03,360
I spent them to stock up.

629
00:29:03,360 --> 00:29:04,200
500 yuan?

630
00:29:04,640 --> 00:29:05,880
If we split it between us,

631
00:29:05,880 --> 00:29:08,200
it'll be 250 yuan each.

632
00:29:08,400 --> 00:29:10,120
No, the 500 yuan is all yours.

633
00:29:10,400 --> 00:29:11,680
What's mine is yours.

634
00:29:12,040 --> 00:29:13,320
Not bad.

635
00:29:13,320 --> 00:29:14,960
Now that we have
the capital and the goods,

636
00:29:14,960 --> 00:29:15,640
it's time

637
00:29:15,640 --> 00:29:17,200
for us to expand.

638
00:29:17,200 --> 00:29:17,720
Have you printed

639
00:29:17,720 --> 00:29:18,440
the fliers for Mianmian Supermarket?

640
00:29:18,920 --> 00:29:20,400
You can trust a good

641
00:29:20,400 --> 00:29:21,720
copywriter like me.

642
00:29:24,480 --> 00:29:25,360
Mianmian Supermarket.

643
00:29:25,360 --> 00:29:26,760
Your most thorough grocery helper.

644
00:29:26,760 --> 00:29:27,560
Just one call and you'll find

645
00:29:27,560 --> 00:29:28,440
what you want at your doorstep.

646
00:29:28,640 --> 00:29:29,440
I love it!

647
00:29:29,440 --> 00:29:30,080
Right?

648
00:29:30,400 --> 00:29:30,800
Let's go.

649
00:29:31,200 --> 00:29:31,720
Let's go.

650
00:29:32,760 --> 00:29:34,480
The recess is too short

651
00:29:34,480 --> 00:29:35,480
and your classroom is too high above

652
00:29:35,480 --> 00:29:37,240
to buy snacks?

653
00:29:37,240 --> 00:29:37,960
Mianmian Supermarket.

654
00:29:37,960 --> 00:29:39,640
Your most thorough grocery helper.

655
00:29:39,640 --> 00:29:40,120
My friend.

656
00:29:40,120 --> 00:29:41,480
Sick of an empty stomach

657
00:29:41,480 --> 00:29:42,400
because you can only
have a small breakfast

658
00:29:42,400 --> 00:29:43,080
and your teacher

659
00:29:43,080 --> 00:29:44,480
starts teaching early?

660
00:29:44,480 --> 00:29:45,280
Mianmian Supermarket.

661
00:29:45,280 --> 00:29:47,120
Your solution to your tummy problem.

662
00:29:47,120 --> 00:29:48,840
Open yourself up to the warm embrace
of Mianmian Supermarket.

663
00:29:48,840 --> 00:29:49,320
In here,

664
00:29:49,320 --> 00:29:50,440
your imagination is the only thing

665
00:29:50,440 --> 00:29:51,560
that limits your options.

666
00:29:51,560 --> 00:29:52,640
Have a look.

667
00:29:52,640 --> 00:29:53,560
Come.

668
00:29:53,560 --> 00:29:54,160
Lover discount.

669
00:29:54,160 --> 00:29:54,680
Friendship discount.

670
00:29:54,680 --> 00:29:55,240
Family discount.

671
00:29:55,240 --> 00:29:56,160
There will be a discount anywhere.

672
00:29:56,160 --> 00:29:56,680
Come.

673
00:29:56,680 --> 00:29:57,640
Have a look.

20-yuan meal. 30-yuan meal.

Every meal will be a filling one.

00:29:59,720 --> 00:30:01,040
Come have a look.

678
00:30:01,040 --> 00:30:01,600
10-yuan meal.

679
00:30:01,600 --> 00:30:02,920
20-yuan meal. 30-yuan meal.

680
00:30:02,920 --> 00:30:03,920
Every meal will be a filling one.

681
00:30:03,920 --> 00:30:05,160
Come have a look.

682
00:30:05,160 --> 00:30:05,800
Mianmian Supermarket.

683

00:30:11,880 --> 00:30:14,080
Mianmian Supermarket?

687
00:30:15,560 --> 00:30:16,880
Your most thorough...

688
00:30:18,160 --> 00:30:18,840
Hi, sir.

689
00:30:19,120 --> 00:30:20,120
What are you hiding?

690
00:30:21,840 --> 00:30:22,760
Show it to me.

691
00:30:30,800 --> 00:30:32,678
(Mianmian Supermarket)

692
00:30:32,680 --> 00:30:34,440
Mianmian Supermarket?

693
00:30:35,800 --> 00:30:36,640
I do not run it.

694
00:30:47,360 --> 00:30:48,600
(I want all the chocolate, all the snickers,
and as many spicy strips as possible.)

695
00:30:52,720 --> 00:30:54,000
What is wrong with you?

696
00:30:54,000 --> 00:30:54,840
Are you a jack-in-the-box clown?

697
00:30:54,840 --> 00:30:56,360
You spring up whenever you want.

698
00:30:56,920 --> 00:30:58,080
We're about to be rich.

699
00:30:58,080 --> 00:30:59,120
We have a rich client here.

700
00:31:00,320 --> 00:31:01,480
He wants all the chocolate,

701
00:31:01,480 --> 00:31:02,480
all the snickers,

702
00:31:02,480 --> 00:31:03,720
and as many spicy strips as possible.

703
00:31:04,120 --> 00:31:04,880
Oh my goodness.

704
00:31:04,880 --> 00:31:06,200
I haven't seen

705
00:31:06,200 --> 00:31:07,280
such a huge order before.

706
00:31:07,280 --> 00:31:08,120
Such extravaganza.

707
00:31:08,360 --> 00:31:09,760
He

708
00:31:09,760 --> 00:31:10,640
will put

709
00:31:10,640 --> 00:31:12,080
all sugar daddies to shame.

710
00:31:12,440 --> 00:31:13,160
What are we waiting for?

711
00:31:13,160 --> 00:31:14,040
Let's make sure he's happy.

712
00:31:14,480 --> 00:31:15,000
Understood.

713
00:31:15,440 --> 00:31:16,160
Wait.

714
00:31:17,040 --> 00:31:18,480
I'll come with you.

715
00:31:19,600 --> 00:31:20,720
Why? Because you know carrying

716
00:31:20,720 --> 00:31:21,960
those things might be too much for me?

717
00:31:24,160 --> 00:31:24,960
Wake up.

718
00:31:25,280 --> 00:31:26,720
I just don't want you
to hoard the profit.

719
00:31:33,240 --> 00:31:34,640
Oh, a regular.

720
00:31:34,640 --> 00:31:35,800
You ordered so many things.

721
00:31:35,800 --> 00:31:36,640
Will you be able to finish them?

722
00:31:36,640 --> 00:31:37,920
Thank you for your patronage.

723
00:31:40,040 --> 00:31:41,200
Run.

724
00:31:41,440 --> 00:31:42,000
Run?

725
00:31:42,520 --> 00:31:43,160
We can't.

726
00:31:43,160 --> 00:31:44,440
We haven't delivered the goods yet.

727
00:31:44,440 --> 00:31:46,160
Let us know what you need next time.

728
00:31:46,160 --> 00:31:47,640
We will gladly offer our service.

729
00:31:50,280 --> 00:31:51,480
Your dad.

730
00:31:52,200 --> 00:31:52,960
My dad?

731
00:31:53,840 --> 00:31:54,280
Right.

732
00:31:54,840 --> 00:31:56,320
You're our VIP.

733
00:31:56,320 --> 00:31:57,120
You want us to call you daddy?

734
00:31:57,360 --> 00:31:58,200
I can even call you Master.

735
00:31:58,200 --> 00:31:59,360
Mr. Xie, is it?

736
00:32:03,440 --> 00:32:04,560
Your business is prospering.

737
00:32:05,480 --> 00:32:06,800
You even start calling others
daddies now.

738
00:32:07,440 --> 00:32:07,920
Dad.

739
00:32:08,640 --> 00:32:09,560
I'm not your dad.

740
00:32:10,080 --> 00:32:11,120
He is.

741
00:32:18,280 --> 00:32:19,120
Did you find it?

742
00:32:19,480 --> 00:32:20,120
Not yet.

743
00:32:22,600 --> 00:32:23,280
Keep looking then.

744
00:32:23,520 --> 00:32:24,280
Found it.

745
00:32:24,280 --> 00:32:25,360
Xing!

746
00:32:25,880 --> 00:32:26,880
Lin Xi!

747
00:32:27,480 --> 00:32:28,320
Run!

748
00:32:28,840 --> 00:32:30,760
You have our total assets there.

749
00:32:32,320 --> 00:32:34,480
Have you heard of the three-pronged
approach in financial management?

750
00:32:34,480 --> 00:32:35,600
Translate it!

751
00:32:35,920 --> 00:32:37,080
It means we should split up.

752
00:32:38,760 --> 00:32:39,720
I'll go that side.

753
00:32:39,720 --> 00:32:40,400
Stay right there!

754
00:32:40,400 --> 00:32:41,160
Don't you run.

755
00:32:45,320 --> 00:32:46,360
What is going on?

756
00:32:46,360 --> 00:32:48,040
Why are we pulling a Fast & Furious now?

757
00:32:48,560 --> 00:32:49,360
It's a long story.

758
00:32:49,360 --> 00:32:50,000
Stay right there!

759
00:32:50,240 --> 00:32:50,600
They are here.

760
00:32:50,600 --> 00:32:52,160
Lin Xi, catch this.

761
00:32:52,200 --> 00:32:52,440
Let's go.

762
00:32:52,440 --> 00:32:53,280
Climb upstairs.

763
00:32:54,200 --> 00:32:55,040
Don't you run!

764
00:32:55,920 --> 00:32:56,960
You go up.

765
00:32:57,520 --> 00:32:58,080
Stay there!

766
00:32:58,080 --> 00:32:58,840
Don't run.

767
00:32:59,280 --> 00:33:00,160
Stay there!

768
00:33:00,760 --> 00:33:01,680
Stop running.

769
00:33:10,160 --> 00:33:10,400
Stay there!

770
00:33:10,400 --> 00:33:10,880
Mister.

771
00:33:11,080 --> 00:33:12,000
Let's stop chasing.

772
00:33:12,280 --> 00:33:14,000
You're out of breath.

773
00:33:14,240 --> 00:33:15,080
It's not worth it.

774
00:33:15,960 --> 00:33:16,760
No.

775
00:33:17,080 --> 00:33:19,640
This is my duty.

776
00:33:20,520 --> 00:33:21,400
Run.

777
00:33:21,880 --> 00:33:22,640
Stop running.

778
00:33:26,120 --> 00:33:26,840
Don't run.

779
00:33:27,560 --> 00:33:29,000
I will catch you.

780
00:33:29,240 --> 00:33:30,520
Move aside!

781
00:33:55,120 --> 00:33:56,080
I can't do this.

782
00:33:56,080 --> 00:33:56,960
Neither can I.

783
00:33:57,800 --> 00:33:58,440
What should we do?

784
00:33:58,720 --> 00:33:59,680
Should we...

785
00:34:00,760 --> 00:34:01,400
Let's throw them away.

786
00:34:02,560 --> 00:34:03,600
Candies!

787
00:34:03,600 --> 00:34:05,120
Get your free candies!

788
00:34:05,120 --> 00:34:06,040
Stop running.

789
00:34:16,160 --> 00:34:17,280
Usain Bolt Xie.

790
00:34:18,840 --> 00:34:20,120
Flo-Jo Jiang.

791
00:34:22,360 --> 00:34:23,960
You two can run.

792
00:34:24,880 --> 00:34:27,200
Should I send you two
to a sports school?

793
00:34:28,960 --> 00:34:31,040
Sorry, dad.

794
00:34:31,400 --> 00:34:32,440
We surrender.

795
00:34:33,720 --> 00:34:35,080
In my office. Now!

796
00:34:44,600 --> 00:34:45,360
I...

797
00:34:46,200 --> 00:34:46,920
Where are they?

798
00:34:48,640 --> 00:34:50,200
Did they disappear?

799
00:34:54,480 --> 00:34:56,040
I will find you.

800
00:35:11,240 --> 00:35:12,520
I was once chased

801
00:35:12,920 --> 00:35:14,200
by a goose too.

802
00:35:15,280 --> 00:35:16,840
But he's way scarier than a goose.

803
00:35:17,480 --> 00:35:19,280
I guess Jiang Yimian and Xie Ang
are caught.

804
00:35:20,240 --> 00:35:21,600
What should we do with
these two bags of snacks?

805
00:35:23,520 --> 00:35:24,760
Sherlock Holmes once said

806
00:35:25,240 --> 00:35:26,680
the only way to clear one's name

807
00:35:27,280 --> 00:35:28,400
is to destroy

808
00:35:28,880 --> 00:35:29,960
the evidence.

809
00:35:39,080 --> 00:35:40,240
Mianmian Supermarket.

810
00:35:40,560 --> 00:35:41,680
What a nice name.

811
00:35:42,000 --> 00:35:42,760
Jiang Yimian,

812
00:35:43,280 --> 00:35:44,680
is this your business?

813
00:35:45,200 --> 00:35:45,840
Yes

814
00:35:46,440 --> 00:35:47,120
and no.

815
00:35:47,120 --> 00:35:48,520
Don't beat around the bush.

816
00:35:49,480 --> 00:35:50,240
I'm telling you.

817
00:35:50,560 --> 00:35:52,320
A high school is a sacred ground
for knowledge.

818
00:35:52,600 --> 00:35:54,080
It's not for you to conduct
your business activity.

819
00:35:54,880 --> 00:35:56,160
What's wrong with a few
business activities?

820
00:35:56,680 --> 00:35:58,040
We sell something small today

821
00:35:58,040 --> 00:35:59,800
but tomorrow,
we might become entrepreneurs

822
00:35:59,800 --> 00:36:01,000
who can bolster our national strength.

823
00:36:01,000 --> 00:36:01,880
Shut up.

824
00:36:02,640 --> 00:36:03,840
Did I say you could speak?

825
00:36:06,080 --> 00:36:06,840
Jiang Yimian.

826
00:36:07,480 --> 00:36:08,320
What should we do?

827
00:36:09,120 --> 00:36:10,120
Inform your parents

828
00:36:10,120 --> 00:36:11,040
or a demerit?

829
00:36:11,360 --> 00:36:12,720
Don't inform my parents.

830
00:36:13,240 --> 00:36:13,960
If my mom knows about this,

831
00:36:13,960 --> 00:36:15,160
she will beat me to death.

832
00:36:16,240 --> 00:36:17,000
All right then.

833
00:36:17,640 --> 00:36:19,240
I'll leave you a demerit.

834
00:36:19,960 --> 00:36:21,960
A major demerit.

835
00:36:22,200 --> 00:36:23,320
It will follow you forever.

836
00:36:24,000 --> 00:36:25,880
Dad, you can't do that.

837
00:36:26,280 --> 00:36:27,000
This is not serious enough

838
00:36:27,000 --> 00:36:27,920
to warrant a demerit.

839
00:36:30,520 --> 00:36:31,400
Put it on me.

840
00:36:32,480 --> 00:36:33,360
I'll say it out loud here.

841
00:36:33,880 --> 00:36:34,840
I started the business.

842
00:36:34,840 --> 00:36:35,440
I sold the goods.

843
00:36:35,440 --> 00:36:36,080
The stupid name was from me too.

844
00:36:36,080 --> 00:36:37,240
It has nothing to do with her.

845
00:36:37,680 --> 00:36:38,440
Xie Ang,

846
00:36:38,880 --> 00:36:40,160
growing insolent, right?

847
00:36:57,440 --> 00:36:59,440
This must be the snack paradise
they talk about.

848
00:37:00,600 --> 00:37:02,400
We got rid of all evidence, didn't we?

849
00:37:02,600 --> 00:37:03,240
Not yet.

850
00:37:03,240 --> 00:37:04,360
There's some on your lips.

851
00:37:07,920 --> 00:37:08,360
I think we forgot

852
00:37:08,360 --> 00:37:09,720
something important.

853
00:37:11,600 --> 00:37:12,320
The shortlist.

854
00:37:15,120 --> 00:37:15,960
Are you all right?

855
00:37:17,960 --> 00:37:19,040
I'm fine.

856
00:37:25,360 --> 00:37:26,960
Due to his stellar academic performance,

857
00:37:26,960 --> 00:37:28,360
Ji Junxing of Class 1, Grade 12

858
00:37:28,360 --> 00:37:29,920
is accepted exceptionally
into the provincial team.

859
00:37:29,920 --> 00:37:32,040
