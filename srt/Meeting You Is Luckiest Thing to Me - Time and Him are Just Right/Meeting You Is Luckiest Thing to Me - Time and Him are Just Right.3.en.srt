(Ji Luchi,)

18
00:01:46,629 --> 00:01:47,509
(don't ever ask me
to wear cartoon panty)

19
00:01:47,509 --> 00:01:48,749
(with you again.)

20
00:01:58,549 --> 00:02:00,309
Why is it at Ji Luchi's balcony?

21
00:02:32,469 --> 00:02:33,469
What are you doing?

22
00:02:42,749 --> 00:02:43,549
Are you alright?

23
00:02:43,909 --> 00:02:45,629
I sprained my ankle not my chest.

24
00:02:46,749 --> 00:02:47,749
Haven't you peeked enough?

25
00:02:47,749 --> 00:02:48,909
Why are you here?

26
00:02:50,149 --> 00:02:51,229
There's no need to feel embarrassed.

27
00:02:51,229 --> 00:02:53,549
Actually, I like Pikachu,

28
00:02:53,549 --> 00:02:55,189
Crayon Shinchan, and Doraemon too.

29
00:02:55,189 --> 00:02:56,429
Can you stop talking?

30
00:02:59,189 --> 00:03:00,709
Can I ask you one more question?

31
00:03:02,229 --> 00:03:03,949
Do you want to go to hospital?

32
00:03:18,549 --> 00:03:20,349
Who is it that's got an issue?

33
00:03:20,349 --> 00:03:21,469
It's him.

34
00:03:22,989 --> 00:03:23,869
I sprained my right ankle.

35
00:03:24,229 --> 00:03:25,789
It might be a fracture, doctor.

36
00:03:25,789 --> 00:03:27,189
He fell on his face just now.

37
00:03:27,189 --> 00:03:28,429
It looked painful.

38
00:03:28,429 --> 00:03:29,429
You'd better check on him.

39
00:03:29,429 --> 00:03:29,909
The best is to do a...

40
00:03:29,909 --> 00:03:31,389
Can you leave first?

41
00:03:35,349 --> 00:03:35,789
Sure.

42
00:03:41,389 --> 00:03:42,309
Come, take off your shoe.

43
00:03:42,309 --> 00:03:42,989
Let me take a look.

44
00:03:59,149 --> 00:04:01,909
Has Crayon Shinchan had
a grudge against me?

45
00:04:02,269 --> 00:04:02,909
Miss.

46
00:04:04,789 --> 00:04:06,429
Do you like Crayon Shinchan?

47
00:04:07,549 --> 00:04:08,269
I don't like it.

48
00:04:08,509 --> 00:04:09,349
I like it.

49
00:04:10,469 --> 00:04:12,109
I can even talk like him.

50
00:04:13,109 --> 00:04:14,029
That's impressive.

51
00:04:14,309 --> 00:04:15,629
Let me show you.

52
00:04:18,069 --> 00:04:19,989
The alien who shows his butt.

53
00:04:20,229 --> 00:04:26,789
Shake it, shake it.

54
00:04:28,029 --> 00:04:29,829
Shake it.

55
00:04:30,909 --> 00:04:32,029
Don't overthink it.

56
00:04:32,029 --> 00:04:33,269
He performs for me
on his own free will.

57
00:04:33,269 --> 00:04:33,909
Right?

58
00:04:34,189 --> 00:04:35,429
I... I... Anyway,

59
00:04:35,589 --> 00:04:36,989
I'm not trying to tease you.

60
00:04:36,989 --> 00:04:37,509
I mean it.

61
00:04:37,509 --> 00:04:38,869
Shake it.

62
00:04:39,149 --> 00:04:39,789
Shinchan,

63
00:04:42,869 --> 00:04:43,429
let's go home.

64
00:04:43,429 --> 00:04:44,229
Go back to your dad.

65
00:04:44,229 --> 00:04:45,069
Okay, Dad, coming.

66
00:04:49,909 --> 00:04:51,509
Dad, how's your leg?

67
00:04:51,669 --> 00:04:52,669
I'm fine. Let's go home.

68
00:04:53,869 --> 00:04:55,709
This kid happens
to be called Shinchan.

69
00:04:56,989 --> 00:04:58,629
I have nothing to do with this.

70
00:04:58,629 --> 00:04:59,349
I know.

71
00:05:00,109 --> 00:05:01,269
You didn't do it on purpose.

72
00:05:01,749 --> 00:05:03,589
This must be an accident again.

73
00:05:05,549 --> 00:05:07,909
Do you really mean it
or you're just being sarcastic?

74
00:05:08,069 --> 00:05:09,909
It's like the umpteenth times
of accidents back then.

75
00:05:10,109 --> 00:05:11,189
You pulled my shirt.

76
00:05:11,349 --> 00:05:12,869
I was punished and forced
to read an apology because of you.

77
00:05:13,669 --> 00:05:16,469
All this must be your careless mistakes.

78
00:05:17,149 --> 00:05:18,869
You don't think so.

79
00:05:19,309 --> 00:05:20,629
You're clearly accusing me
of being heartless.

80
00:05:23,829 --> 00:05:26,509
I share the blame for today's incident.

81
00:05:26,589 --> 00:05:27,629
Just today?

82
00:05:30,669 --> 00:05:31,629
It's not only today.

83
00:05:31,789 --> 00:05:33,549
What happened back then was
my fault, okay?

84
00:05:33,869 --> 00:05:35,189
So what did the doctor say?

85
00:05:35,189 --> 00:05:36,349
Besides the leg,

86
00:05:36,349 --> 00:05:37,429
how about the other parts?

87
00:05:38,589 --> 00:05:39,189
Do you wish to see me

88
00:05:39,189 --> 00:05:40,829
get hurt all over my body?

89
00:05:41,629 --> 00:05:42,909
I'd like to take responsibility for you.

90
00:05:45,269 --> 00:05:46,749
From now on, I'm your

91
00:05:46,749 --> 00:05:48,029
personal nanny for 24 hours,

92
00:05:48,029 --> 00:05:49,549
a smart butler at your beck and call.

93
00:05:49,909 --> 00:05:50,869
Just think of me as a leg.

94
00:05:50,869 --> 00:05:51,989
Use it whenever you want.

95
00:05:51,989 --> 00:05:52,909
It's not necessary.

96
00:05:53,109 --> 00:05:54,069
I swear.

97
00:05:54,509 --> 00:05:55,229
I won't bring

98
00:05:55,229 --> 00:05:56,749
troubles to you again.

99
00:05:57,149 --> 00:05:57,789
From today onward,

100
00:05:58,509 --> 00:05:59,829
I'll be at your disposal.

101
00:05:59,829 --> 00:06:01,349
I'll do whatever you ask.

102
00:06:06,269 --> 00:06:07,829
(Your ankle is fine.)

103
00:06:08,109 --> 00:06:09,269
(Go back and get some rest.)

104
00:06:10,149 --> 00:06:10,629
Are you for real?

105
00:06:11,349 --> 00:06:12,469
Really and truly.

106
00:06:12,629 --> 00:06:14,269
There's no doubt
about my sincere heart.

107
00:06:15,749 --> 00:06:17,429
So what did the doctor say?

108
00:06:18,229 --> 00:06:20,029
The doctor said my ligament is torn,

109
00:06:20,309 --> 00:06:22,389
and the cartilage in my ankle is
torn and fractured.

110
00:06:23,829 --> 00:06:25,149
It'll take a while to heal.

111
00:06:26,149 --> 00:06:27,109
That serious?

112
00:06:28,989 --> 00:06:29,869
Well,

113
00:06:30,029 --> 00:06:30,909
it must be taken care of.

114
00:06:31,749 --> 00:06:32,789
Let me help you.

115
00:06:33,109 --> 00:06:33,669
Easy, easy.

116
00:06:34,669 --> 00:06:35,109
Be careful.

117
00:06:35,629 --> 00:06:36,629
Slow down, slow down.

118
00:06:37,389 --> 00:06:38,829
I'll go get the prescription for you.

119
00:06:39,469 --> 00:06:40,549
Easy, easy.

120
00:06:41,069 --> 00:06:42,069
Go that way.

121
00:06:44,549 --> 00:06:45,309
Turn right, turn right.

122
00:06:45,829 --> 00:06:46,429
Hold my arm.

123
00:06:47,189 --> 00:06:47,869
Keep the weight off.

124
00:06:47,869 --> 00:06:49,149
Lean against me.

125
00:06:49,389 --> 00:06:50,229
Lean against my body.

126
00:06:50,749 --> 00:06:51,469
We're almost there.

127
00:06:51,629 --> 00:06:52,709
There's one meter away.

128
00:06:53,749 --> 00:06:54,309
Hang in there.

129
00:06:54,589 --> 00:06:55,069
Hang in there.

130
00:06:55,389 --> 00:06:56,069
Be careful.

131
00:06:56,189 --> 00:06:57,269
Be careful. We're here.

132
00:07:03,709 --> 00:07:04,309
Come, lean against it.

133
00:07:04,309 --> 00:07:05,149
It'll feel more comfortable.

134
00:07:06,469 --> 00:07:07,229
Let me help you take off your shoes.

135
00:07:08,909 --> 00:07:10,029
I'll put them on the bed.

136
00:07:10,749 --> 00:07:11,789
Another one.

137
00:07:14,069 --> 00:07:14,669
Sir,

138
00:07:14,869 --> 00:07:16,309
do you need anything else?

139
00:07:18,709 --> 00:07:20,269
Can you prop my leg up?

140
00:07:21,029 --> 00:07:21,509
Got it.

141
00:07:22,789 --> 00:07:23,549
The pillow.

142
00:07:24,549 --> 00:07:25,509
I'll be gentle.

143
00:07:26,709 --> 00:07:27,469
Easy. Slow down.

144
00:07:28,309 --> 00:07:29,149
I'm sorry.

145
00:07:29,789 --> 00:07:30,949
Do you want me to tuck you in?

146
00:07:31,669 --> 00:07:32,189
No need.

147
00:07:32,189 --> 00:07:33,429
I'll call you if I need it.

148
00:07:33,909 --> 00:07:35,349
Okay, rest in peace.

149
00:07:40,149 --> 00:07:41,149
That was a slip of the tongue.

150
00:07:41,149 --> 00:07:42,229
Rest, rest well.

151
00:07:44,629 --> 00:07:45,989
Close the door when you leave.

152
00:07:49,109 --> 00:07:49,869
Yes.

153
00:07:50,469 --> 00:07:51,149
Will do.

154
00:07:59,629 --> 00:08:00,229
That feels great.

155
00:08:00,469 --> 00:08:01,549
It's a blessing in disguise.

156
00:08:02,229 --> 00:08:03,909
I can finally have some privacy.

157
00:08:20,789 --> 00:08:22,549
It's really hard to be an errand girl.

158
00:08:23,309 --> 00:08:24,709
It nearly killed me.

159
00:08:26,069 --> 00:08:26,509
Water.

160
00:08:28,229 --> 00:08:28,909
I need some water.

161
00:08:34,429 --> 00:08:35,389
Lin Xi!

162
00:08:35,989 --> 00:08:37,269
Sorry,

163
00:08:37,629 --> 00:08:38,949
I'm a bit thirsty.

164
00:08:41,789 --> 00:08:42,589
Coming!

165
00:08:51,909 --> 00:08:52,709
On my way.

166
00:09:06,069 --> 00:09:07,469
Junxing, come hand out
the test papers.

167
00:09:17,829 --> 00:09:19,269
Miss, I'll help him do it.

168
00:09:22,149 --> 00:09:22,949
I'm leaving, Xing.

169
00:09:22,949 --> 00:09:23,949
Don't forget that you're on duty today.

170
00:09:28,109 --> 00:09:28,629
Let's go.

171
00:09:29,389 --> 00:09:30,189
You leave first.

172
00:09:31,269 --> 00:09:31,909
I'll do it for you.

173
00:09:33,220 --> 00:09:34,620
(Realistic Progressive Erudite Humble)

174
00:09:40,389 --> 00:09:40,949
What are you doing?

175
00:09:41,189 --> 00:09:41,909
I dropped my pen.

176
00:09:42,429 --> 00:09:42,909
Don't move.

177
00:09:44,069 --> 00:09:44,549
Let me do it.

178
00:09:47,949 --> 00:09:48,389
Do you know

179
00:09:48,389 --> 00:09:49,829
the phrase, "Butterfly effect"?

180
00:09:49,989 --> 00:09:51,029
As you bend down
and hold your hand out,

181
00:09:51,029 --> 00:09:52,069
what if it affects your leg?

182
00:09:54,509 --> 00:09:55,349
Geez.

183
00:09:55,709 --> 00:09:56,509
You're right.

184
00:10:05,860 --> 00:10:07,690
(Unremitting self-improvement,
the unity of knowing and doing)

185
00:10:07,709 --> 00:10:08,469
Wait, guys.

186
00:10:08,829 --> 00:10:09,829
We'll have a compulsory labor

187
00:10:09,829 --> 00:10:10,909
in the community tomorrow.

188
00:10:10,909 --> 00:10:11,949
I'll assign tasks

189
00:10:11,949 --> 00:10:12,909
to each team.

190
00:10:14,589 --> 00:10:16,069
Okay, work brings glory.

191
00:10:16,789 --> 00:10:18,309
Team one and team three are
to sweep the floor.

192
00:10:18,549 --> 00:10:20,309
Team two and team four are
to remove the advertisement.

193
00:10:20,429 --> 00:10:22,109
Team five and team seven are
to wipe the glass.

194
00:10:22,229 --> 00:10:24,109
Team six and team eight are
to remove the weeds.

195
00:10:24,349 --> 00:10:25,709
Well, when we reach there,

196
00:10:25,709 --> 00:10:27,109
the teacher will assign
the responsible areas

197
00:10:27,189 --> 00:10:28,949
to each team. That's all for now.

198
00:10:37,629 --> 00:10:38,069
Xie Ang,

199
00:10:38,069 --> 00:10:38,909
come out for a minute.

200
00:10:46,229 --> 00:10:47,669
What's wrong?
You're acting all mysterious.

201
00:10:48,109 --> 00:10:48,669
Well,

202
00:10:49,949 --> 00:10:51,069
during the compulsory labor,

203
00:10:51,069 --> 00:10:52,389
can I be on Ji Junxing's team?

204
00:10:53,869 --> 00:10:55,189
You want to transfer to his team?

205
00:10:56,749 --> 00:10:58,869
I knew you got evil intentions
towards Xing.

206
00:10:59,149 --> 00:11:00,469
It's not what you think.

207
00:11:00,789 --> 00:11:01,709
His leg is injured.

208
00:11:01,709 --> 00:11:02,949
I just want to share his burden.

209
00:11:04,949 --> 00:11:06,029
Are you going to help me or not?

210
00:11:06,709 --> 00:11:08,189
Yes, of course I'll help you.

211
00:11:08,709 --> 00:11:10,469
As the saying goes, everything could be

212
00:11:10,469 --> 00:11:11,469
damaged except...

213
00:11:12,149 --> 00:11:13,069
I'm not done yet.

214
00:11:16,909 --> 00:11:18,549
What were you two talking about?

215
00:11:19,869 --> 00:11:20,429
Xing,

216
00:11:20,749 --> 00:11:21,749
I'm really envious of you.

217
00:11:22,109 --> 00:11:23,309
Can you teach me your skill?

218
00:11:23,509 --> 00:11:24,309
How did you make

219
00:11:24,309 --> 00:11:25,549
Lin Xi so obedient?

220
00:11:26,109 --> 00:11:26,789
It's very easy.

221
00:11:30,549 --> 00:11:31,669
Break one of your legs first.

222
00:11:54,989 --> 00:11:55,749
It's you.

223
00:11:59,269 --> 00:12:00,069
Long time no see.

224
00:12:00,949 --> 00:12:02,429
I went out for a game
two days ago.

225
00:12:03,549 --> 00:12:04,749
And I won three gold medals.

226
00:12:04,869 --> 00:12:05,429
You can have them.

227
00:12:08,469 --> 00:12:10,869
The champion of men's 110-meter hurdles

228
00:12:11,309 --> 00:12:12,749
at High School Athletics Championships.

229
00:12:13,309 --> 00:12:16,109
The winner of the regional, municipal
and provincial games.

230
00:12:16,629 --> 00:12:17,469
Impressive.

231
00:12:18,029 --> 00:12:18,989
Of course.

232
00:12:19,949 --> 00:12:21,469
When one gets a gold medal,

233
00:12:21,469 --> 00:12:23,429
they'll first bite it
and see if it's a pure gold.

234
00:12:23,629 --> 00:12:24,549
Why didn't you do that?

235
00:12:25,389 --> 00:12:26,749
I'm afraid it'll break my teeth.

236
00:12:27,549 --> 00:12:28,749
Besides, the Olympics gold medals

237
00:12:28,749 --> 00:12:29,549
are all gold plated.

238
00:12:29,789 --> 00:12:30,509
They contain

239
00:12:30,509 --> 00:12:31,669
less than one percent pure gold.

240
00:12:31,669 --> 00:12:32,789
The rest are silver.

241
00:12:35,829 --> 00:12:37,069
Then, my dream of making

242
00:12:37,069 --> 00:12:38,509
a fast buck by selling

243
00:12:38,669 --> 00:12:39,869
gold medals is over.

244
00:12:40,509 --> 00:12:41,349
You don't know that?

245
00:12:41,789 --> 00:12:42,589
Yes.

246
00:12:48,069 --> 00:12:50,389
I saw you lying here,
looking quite upset.

247
00:12:50,669 --> 00:12:51,509
Tell me

248
00:12:51,509 --> 00:12:52,269
who upset you.

249
00:12:53,629 --> 00:12:54,149
I'm fine.

250
00:12:54,509 --> 00:12:56,149
I broke someone's leg.

251
00:12:56,429 --> 00:12:57,669
That's brutal.

252
00:12:57,949 --> 00:12:59,069
I'm impressed.

253
00:12:59,909 --> 00:13:01,309
That was a careless mistake.

254
00:13:01,789 --> 00:13:02,749
But the consequence is

255
00:13:03,229 --> 00:13:04,469
that I've got to be

256
00:13:04,469 --> 00:13:05,509
the victim's slave.

257
00:13:05,509 --> 00:13:06,389
During the weekend community labor,

258
00:13:06,389 --> 00:13:07,749
I have to remove the advertisement.

259
00:13:08,109 --> 00:13:09,949
What is the location, then?

260
00:13:11,029 --> 00:13:11,789
Happy Square.

261
00:13:14,549 --> 00:13:16,029
Happy Square?

262
00:13:35,469 --> 00:13:36,869
Accreditation and mortgage.

263
00:13:37,349 --> 00:13:38,349
Infertility.

264
00:13:38,669 --> 00:13:39,909
Professional lock-picking.

265
00:13:40,269 --> 00:13:41,469
Unblocking the drains.

266
00:13:42,429 --> 00:13:43,829
Pay dear for a son.

267
00:13:45,269 --> 00:13:46,909
There are so many careers.

268
00:13:47,269 --> 00:13:48,629
They put up flyers everywhere.

269
00:13:48,989 --> 00:13:51,109
This is spectacular.

270
00:13:52,149 --> 00:13:53,749
I'll leave them

271
00:13:53,749 --> 00:13:54,789
to you and Lin Xi.

272
00:13:55,069 --> 00:13:57,309
Jiang Yimian and I will be there
to remove the bubblegum.

273
00:13:57,829 --> 00:13:59,069
Let's have lunch
at the gazebo this noon.

274
00:14:07,149 --> 00:14:08,229
Since it's a heavy task,

275
00:14:08,629 --> 00:14:09,549
let's work together.

276
00:14:10,469 --> 00:14:11,029
Sure.

277
00:14:11,349 --> 00:14:13,509
Well, let's distribute the work
by three and seven.

278
00:14:14,189 --> 00:14:14,669
No.

279
00:14:15,109 --> 00:14:15,789
Nine and one.

280
00:14:17,269 --> 00:14:18,909
I do this because you're a girl.

281
00:14:18,909 --> 00:14:19,989
Don't push it.

282
00:14:20,429 --> 00:14:21,149
No, no.

283
00:14:21,269 --> 00:14:22,029
You've got the wrong idea.

284
00:14:22,269 --> 00:14:24,229
I'm the nine, and you're the one.

285
00:14:29,589 --> 00:14:30,229
What are you doing?

286
00:14:34,709 --> 00:14:36,669
You'll take care of the area
below this line.

287
00:14:36,949 --> 00:14:38,149
I'll be in charge
of the area above it.

288
00:14:39,829 --> 00:14:41,269
How is it? Are you satisfied?

289
00:14:42,469 --> 00:14:44,989
Okay, let's work well together.

290
00:14:45,989 --> 00:14:46,749
Okay.

291
00:15:06,269 --> 00:15:06,829
No.

292
00:15:07,109 --> 00:15:08,949
It'll take forever for you to remove

293
00:15:08,949 --> 00:15:10,429
all the advertisements in this street.

294
00:15:11,389 --> 00:15:13,189
You're definitely quick
as there are only two to remove.

295
00:15:27,469 --> 00:15:28,189
What are you doing?

296
00:15:28,509 --> 00:15:29,229
Watch me.

297
00:15:46,789 --> 00:15:47,829
That's amazing.

298
00:15:51,949 --> 00:15:53,109
Got that?

299
00:15:56,109 --> 00:15:58,949
Actually, I didn't get
a clear look at it.

300
00:15:59,269 --> 00:16:00,429
Can you do it again?

301
00:16:02,189 --> 00:16:03,229
Should I remove all of them

302
00:16:03,229 --> 00:16:04,229
on this wall for you?

303
00:16:07,109 --> 00:16:07,749
I'll do it.

304
00:16:09,029 --> 00:16:10,309
You go and take a break.

305
00:16:31,029 --> 00:16:31,669
Xing,

306
00:16:31,909 --> 00:16:33,229
(Recycle without wasting)
you're such a philanthropist.

307
00:16:33,469 --> 00:16:34,309
This Kentucky Chicken has

308
00:16:34,309 --> 00:16:35,869
perfectly cured the weary me.

309
00:16:37,069 --> 00:16:38,549
I think you're possessed
by a hungry ghost.

310
00:16:39,029 --> 00:16:40,309
No one will steal it
from you. Slow down.

311
00:16:48,869 --> 00:16:50,789
Here, eat a drumstick
to boost your energy.

312
00:16:51,629 --> 00:16:53,229
This is not what I need.

313
00:16:53,669 --> 00:16:54,309
What I need is

314
00:16:54,309 --> 00:16:56,349
that 1000 hands
of the thousand-armed bodhisattva.

315
00:16:57,549 --> 00:16:58,829
You look down
on this drumstick, don't you?

316
00:16:58,829 --> 00:16:59,589
Forget it.

317
00:17:01,349 --> 00:17:02,389
I should fill my stomach.

318
00:17:04,509 --> 00:17:05,229
Eat more.

319
00:17:05,509 --> 00:17:06,549
We can do work well
only when we're full.

320
00:17:13,949 --> 00:17:14,669
Mianmian,

321
00:17:15,189 --> 00:17:16,189
do you know how many posters

322
00:17:16,189 --> 00:17:17,709
in total I've removed today?

323
00:17:18,149 --> 00:17:19,629
245 pieces.

324
00:17:19,629 --> 00:17:20,589
That many?

325
00:17:20,949 --> 00:17:22,149
You've worked hard.

326
00:17:23,989 --> 00:17:25,709
Five more pieces to make it

327
00:17:26,429 --> 00:17:27,189
a round number, 250.

328
00:17:28,149 --> 00:17:28,909
It fits a simpleton like you.

329
00:17:29,189 --> 00:17:30,189
How dare you laugh?

330
00:17:31,869 --> 00:17:33,389
Those two pieces
you used to demonstrate

331
00:17:33,389 --> 00:17:34,869
and the three pieces you removed.

332
00:17:35,629 --> 00:17:36,789
Who do you think it's the simpleton?

333
00:17:43,429 --> 00:17:44,469
Come out for a moment, Lin Xi.

334
00:17:47,909 --> 00:17:48,469
What do you want?

335
00:17:52,469 --> 00:17:53,749
Can't you tell he does it on purpose?

336
00:17:53,829 --> 00:17:54,949
You just let him bully you like this?

337
00:17:55,429 --> 00:17:57,189
He broke his leg because of me.

338
00:17:57,949 --> 00:17:58,909
Besides,

339
00:17:59,269 --> 00:18:01,029
I really want to make friends with him.

340
00:18:01,029 --> 00:18:02,229
Your leg is broken for real?

341
00:18:04,869 --> 00:18:05,469
You guess.

342
00:18:06,309 --> 00:18:06,909
Xing,

343
00:18:07,109 --> 00:18:08,389
you're really cold-hearted.

344
00:18:08,629 --> 00:18:10,109
It's not right to treat
a girl like this.

345
00:18:10,349 --> 00:18:12,069
I didn't treat everyone like this.

346
00:18:12,229 --> 00:18:14,029
Fine, she has pushed your button.

347
00:18:15,109 --> 00:18:16,669
You must know who started it at first.

348
00:18:17,189 --> 00:18:19,429
It was her who started it.

349
00:18:21,069 --> 00:18:22,349
Look at your hands.

350
00:18:24,549 --> 00:18:25,949
Just let him do it this afternoon.

351
00:18:26,589 --> 00:18:27,589
Your hands are all red.

352
00:18:28,069 --> 00:18:28,749
It's alright.

353
00:18:30,269 --> 00:18:31,349
Come on. Let's go eat the drumstick.

354
00:18:34,709 --> 00:18:35,389
Look at this.

355
00:18:39,269 --> 00:18:40,629
It's a missing cat notice.

356
00:18:40,740 --> 00:18:43,220
(Notice for missing a cat)

357
00:18:44,149 --> 00:18:45,229
Both of you, come over here.

358
00:18:51,109 --> 00:18:52,829
I've got no kids.

359
00:18:53,429 --> 00:18:55,589
And this cat and I have lived
together for years.

360
00:18:55,909 --> 00:18:57,469
I found it since it was a kitten.

361
00:18:57,469 --> 00:18:58,869
It's been over ten years by now.

362
00:18:59,189 --> 00:19:00,469
We're deeply bonded.

363
00:19:00,469 --> 00:19:02,149
It's like a family to me.

364
00:19:02,829 --> 00:19:04,429
It seems like the owner is
a granny.

365
00:19:04,669 --> 00:19:06,309
Didn't you see it just now?

366
00:19:06,989 --> 00:19:07,669
No.

367
00:19:07,669 --> 00:19:08,389
Mimi.

368
00:19:09,909 --> 00:19:10,829
Mimi.

369
00:19:13,349 --> 00:19:14,069
Kids,

370
00:19:14,309 --> 00:19:15,749
have you seen my Mimi?

371
00:19:15,749 --> 00:19:17,269
Granny, is this your cat?

372
00:19:17,349 --> 00:19:18,189
Yes, it is.

373
00:19:18,389 --> 00:19:19,789
It's already ten-odd years old.

374
00:19:20,109 --> 00:19:21,629
It can find its way home

375
00:19:21,629 --> 00:19:22,909
when it was little.

376
00:19:24,109 --> 00:19:26,949
But this time, it hasn't returned yet.

377
00:19:27,589 --> 00:19:29,509
What if it's hungry?

378
00:19:29,629 --> 00:19:30,549
Don't worry, Granny.

379
00:19:30,709 --> 00:19:32,029
I'm sure we can find Mimi.

380
00:19:32,629 --> 00:19:34,349
Well, if you find it,

381
00:19:34,509 --> 00:19:35,669
can you bring it back for me?

382
00:19:35,669 --> 00:19:36,229
Sure.

383
00:19:36,229 --> 00:19:38,549
My phone number is on it.

384
00:19:38,549 --> 00:19:39,149
Look.

385
00:19:39,989 --> 00:19:40,549
Okay.

386
00:19:41,709 --> 00:19:43,069
I'm counting on you.

387
00:19:43,309 --> 00:19:44,429
Thank you. Thank you.

388
00:19:45,109 --> 00:19:45,909
Mimi?

389
00:19:48,069 --> 00:19:48,789
Mimi?

390
00:19:50,109 --> 00:19:50,949
Mimi?

391
00:19:51,709 --> 00:19:52,989
What should we do now?

392
00:19:53,869 --> 00:19:54,869
Should we continue our task?

393
00:19:56,229 --> 00:19:57,469
Of course.

394
00:20:02,109 --> 00:20:02,909
Let's find the cat first.

395
00:20:08,549 --> 00:20:09,069
Mimi?

396
00:20:10,149 --> 00:20:10,669
- Mimi.
- Mimi.

397
00:20:13,549 --> 00:20:14,589
Mimi, let's eat canned food.

398
00:20:14,589 --> 00:20:15,229
Mimi.

399
00:20:18,229 --> 00:20:19,589
- Mimi.
- Mimi.

400
00:20:20,229 --> 00:20:20,949
Will it be on a tree?

401
00:20:22,589 --> 00:20:23,069
Do you find anything there?

402
00:20:23,069 --> 00:20:23,789
No.

403
00:20:23,789 --> 00:20:24,989
I see one over there.

404
00:20:29,389 --> 00:20:30,069
Mimi.

405
00:20:32,829 --> 00:20:33,869
This is too skinny.

406
00:20:34,229 --> 00:20:35,389
And its color is different.

407
00:20:36,989 --> 00:20:38,869
All of these are not Mimi.

408
00:20:42,349 --> 00:20:43,149
It's getting dark.

409
00:20:43,149 --> 00:20:44,269
Did it go far?

410
00:20:44,829 --> 00:20:45,909
A ten-odd-year-old cat should

411
00:20:45,909 --> 00:20:47,349
be moving slow.

412
00:20:47,509 --> 00:20:49,829
She just lost it today.
It won't go far.

413
00:20:56,989 --> 00:20:58,829
Look, is that it?

414
00:21:18,829 --> 00:21:20,589
I can't do it. It's too high.

415
00:21:20,589 --> 00:21:21,429
I'm afraid of heights.

416
00:21:22,909 --> 00:21:23,789
An eighty-year-old granny is

417
00:21:23,789 --> 00:21:24,869
more daring than you do.

418
00:21:24,869 --> 00:21:25,789
You're such a coward.

419
00:21:27,549 --> 00:21:28,469
I seriously can't do it.

420
00:21:30,229 --> 00:21:31,149
Why don't you do it?

421
00:21:36,749 --> 00:21:37,429
Let me do it.

422
00:21:37,709 --> 00:21:38,509
You?

423
00:21:38,589 --> 00:21:39,629
How are you going
to do it with one leg?

424
00:21:40,389 --> 00:21:40,949
Let me do it.

425
00:21:42,389 --> 00:21:42,789
I actually...

426
00:21:42,789 --> 00:21:43,909
Actually, I'm good at climbing trees.

427
00:21:44,429 --> 00:21:45,589
I've climbed a taller tree than this.

428
00:21:46,429 --> 00:21:47,349
Are you serious?

429
00:21:47,469 --> 00:21:48,149
Just forget about it.

430
00:21:48,589 --> 00:21:49,189
Just use a ham sausage

431
00:21:49,189 --> 00:21:50,309
to lure it down here.

432
00:21:50,309 --> 00:21:51,549
It'll only take a while.

433
00:21:52,229 --> 00:21:53,509
I'll surely get
both of us down safely.

434
00:22:11,189 --> 00:22:11,789
Be careful.

435
00:22:14,309 --> 00:22:15,189
Be careful.

436
00:22:15,389 --> 00:22:17,069
Don't get yourself hurt.

437
00:22:17,069 --> 00:22:17,429
Rest assured.

438
00:22:17,429 --> 00:22:18,989
I'll still take care of you
even if I'm hurt.

439
00:22:19,109 --> 00:22:20,389
Hold on tight, Lin Xi.

440
00:22:20,589 --> 00:22:21,149
I'm alright.

441
00:22:33,029 --> 00:22:33,549
Mimi.

442
00:22:34,469 --> 00:22:35,789
She's there.

443
00:22:41,109 --> 00:22:41,789
I caught it.

444
00:22:42,069 --> 00:22:42,909
She's way stronger than you.

445
00:22:49,629 --> 00:22:51,509
That's impressive, Lin Xi.

446
00:22:51,509 --> 00:22:52,149
You really got it down.

447
00:22:52,149 --> 00:22:53,709
It's high. Aren't you afraid at all?

448
00:22:54,789 --> 00:22:56,069
As long as you caught it.

449
00:22:56,069 --> 00:22:56,789
Mimi.

450
00:22:56,789 --> 00:22:57,589
It's so cute.

451
00:22:57,589 --> 00:22:58,149
Wonderful.

452
00:23:30,789 --> 00:23:31,949
Granny is on her way here.

453
00:23:32,629 --> 00:23:33,189
Mimi.

454
00:23:33,909 --> 00:23:34,789
Mimi.

455
00:23:39,349 --> 00:23:39,989
Thank you.

456
00:23:40,269 --> 00:23:41,069
Thank you, kids.

457
00:23:41,229 --> 00:23:42,109
Don't mention it.

458
00:23:42,749 --> 00:23:43,229
Mimi.

459
00:23:43,229 --> 00:23:44,549
You must listen to Granny.

460
00:23:44,549 --> 00:23:46,229
Mimi, where have you been?

461
00:23:47,029 --> 00:23:48,429
You went up the tree, didn't you?

462
00:23:48,709 --> 00:23:49,789
And you couldn't get down here.

463
00:23:50,909 --> 00:23:52,709
I can't do square dancing anymore.

464
00:23:53,549 --> 00:23:54,509
Both of us are old.

465
00:23:54,509 --> 00:23:55,869
Let's just stay with each other.

466
00:23:56,749 --> 00:23:57,469
Thank you.

467
00:23:58,189 --> 00:23:58,789
Thank you.

468
00:23:59,389 --> 00:24:00,149
Let's go home.

469
00:24:00,909 --> 00:24:02,429
Go home and eat prawns.

470
00:24:02,869 --> 00:24:04,829
One set for each of us.

471
00:24:05,629 --> 00:24:06,669
Let's eat prawns.

472
00:24:10,869 --> 00:24:12,069
This is so touching.

473
00:24:12,589 --> 00:24:14,109
Even a cat has a better meal than I do.

474
00:24:15,189 --> 00:24:15,749
Nonsense.

475
00:24:16,269 --> 00:24:17,269
Are you as lovely as the cat?

476
00:24:23,669 --> 00:24:24,349
I'm envious.

477
00:24:26,389 --> 00:24:27,469
It still can be found

478
00:24:28,829 --> 00:24:30,029
when it got lost.

479
00:24:43,829 --> 00:24:45,709
Let's call it a day. Dismiss.

480
00:24:45,869 --> 00:24:46,069
Let's go.

481
00:24:46,069 --> 00:24:46,909
That's a wrap.

482
00:24:49,389 --> 00:24:49,989
Go!

483
00:24:56,789 --> 00:24:57,829
We'll come back tomorrow.

484
00:24:58,069 --> 00:24:59,709
That cat is very cute.

485
00:24:59,709 --> 00:25:00,349
Isn't it?

486
00:25:02,749 --> 00:25:04,309
Come, get me the bag behind me.

487
00:25:06,389 --> 00:25:06,989
This?

488
00:25:12,469 --> 00:25:13,189
Wipe it yourself.

489
00:25:13,709 --> 00:25:14,509
Or my mom would think

490
00:25:14,509 --> 00:25:15,509
that I've treated you badly.

491
00:25:18,029 --> 00:25:19,149
Thanks.

492
00:25:24,189 --> 00:25:25,549
Sit over there. Move over.

493
00:25:31,189 --> 00:25:31,749
Let me do it.

494
00:26:04,829 --> 00:26:05,509
Hey,

495
00:26:05,829 --> 00:26:06,949
we could've just lured it down

496
00:26:06,949 --> 00:26:08,429
by using the canned food.

497
00:26:09,029 --> 00:26:10,349
But you insisted on climbing the tree.

498
00:26:10,469 --> 00:26:11,869
You even wasted a box
of alcohol wipes of mine.

499
00:26:12,189 --> 00:26:14,149
That cat is old.
It can't get down by itself.

500
00:26:14,149 --> 00:26:15,229
What if it fell off?

501
00:26:15,389 --> 00:26:16,909
It can as it was able to climb up there.

502
00:26:17,349 --> 00:26:18,549
What if it didn't want to get down?

503
00:26:18,989 --> 00:26:20,589
Can you read the cat's mind?

504
00:26:20,909 --> 00:26:21,669
You don't understand.

505
00:26:21,829 --> 00:26:23,309
A cat will run away from home
when it gets old.

506
00:26:23,429 --> 00:26:24,869
It's a final goodbye to its owner.

507
00:26:24,989 --> 00:26:25,749
A final goodbye?

508
00:26:26,109 --> 00:26:27,829
You've got a vivid imagination.

509
00:26:28,149 --> 00:26:29,029
This is true.

510
00:26:29,349 --> 00:26:30,909
A cat can predict its death.

511
00:26:31,269 --> 00:26:32,629
It knows that it's dying.

512
00:26:32,749 --> 00:26:34,429
So it'll find an empty space

513
00:26:34,429 --> 00:26:35,469
and return to its own planet.

514
00:26:35,949 --> 00:26:37,749
It fears that its body will attract
its nemesis

515
00:26:37,749 --> 00:26:38,909
and bring troubles to its owner.

516
00:26:39,509 --> 00:26:41,669
So it'll choose to disappear.

517
00:26:42,389 --> 00:26:43,149
This is the last thing

518
00:26:43,149 --> 00:26:44,269
they could do for their owners.

519
00:26:46,149 --> 00:26:48,069
Where did you hear
this touching story?

520
00:26:48,269 --> 00:26:49,829
It's not a story. It's true.

521
00:26:50,389 --> 00:26:51,509
This is not scientific.

522
00:26:51,509 --> 00:26:52,469
From what you said,

523
00:26:52,469 --> 00:26:53,549
a cat has nine lives.

524
00:26:53,549 --> 00:26:55,229
Well, it still has eight lives
after losing one.

525
00:26:55,589 --> 00:26:57,629
Can you not joke about life and death?

526
00:26:57,789 --> 00:26:59,029
A cat only has one life like the human.

527
00:26:59,029 --> 00:26:59,909
It dies when it loses its life.

528
00:27:04,109 --> 00:27:05,349
Is she mad?

529
00:27:07,989 --> 00:27:09,029
Ridiculous.

530
00:27:27,069 --> 00:27:27,829
Brother,

531
00:27:30,389 --> 00:27:31,749

Such a claim does exist.

536
00:28:01,069 --> 00:28:02,349
Did I misjudge her?

537
00:28:10,869 --> 00:28:13,869
I was wrong just now.

538
00:28:14,829 --> 00:28:16,309
I shouldn't have made
a joke out of it.

539
00:28:17,509 --> 00:28:18,189
Sorry.

540

Done.

00:30:55,629 --> 00:30:56,309
How is it?

549
00:30:56,829 --> 00:30:57,589
Have you finished eating?

550

Yes.

Come, let me help you digest the food.

555
00:31:04,469 --> 00:31:05,269
No, Bro.

556
00:31:05,709 --> 00:31:07,069
Are you asking us

557
00:31:07,069 --> 00:31:08,509
to jog with you now?

558
00:31:08,829 --> 00:31:10,029
It's no fun to jog.

559
00:31:10,989 --> 00:31:12,309
Let's do a big project.

560
00:31:12,429 --> 00:31:12,989
Come on.

561
00:31:35,549 --> 00:31:37,029

Kai,

563
00:31:38,549 --> 00:31:39,989
this is the big project you mentioned?

564
00:31:40,389 --> 00:31:42,549
I didn't expect Lin Xi to be so fast.

565
00:31:46,749 --> 00:31:47,989
Since we're already here,

566
00:31:48,109 --> 00:31:49,549
let's do something meaningful.

567
00:31:49,789 --> 00:31:50,349
Let's go.

568
00:32:07,789 --> 00:32:09,269
Am I dreaming?

569
00:32:11,269 --> 00:32:11,909
Come here.

570
00:32:15,069 --> 00:32:16,549
What are you doing? It hurts.

571
00:32:16,549 --> 00:32:17,149
Is it?

572
00:32:17,389 --> 00:32:18,549
You're not dreaming since it hurts.

573
00:32:20,109 --> 00:32:22,109
So there really is a snail girl.

574

Maybe it's a snail boy.

575
00:32:25,869 --> 00:32:28,069
So we've got nothing to do today.

576
00:32:28,429 --> 00:32:29,269
That we can happily enjoy

577

Who did this?

579
00:32:33,629 --> 00:32:34,909
That's immoral.

580
00:32:35,749 --> 00:32:36,989
I just put up the poster
last night

581
00:32:36,989 --> 00:32:38,229
and it was removed right after that.

582
00:32:38,749 --> 00:32:40,229
Who did this?

583
00:32:40,229 --> 00:32:41,149
It's you.

584
00:32:41,949 --> 00:32:42,669
What are you going to do?

585
00:32:42,989 --> 00:32:43,829
Are you trying to show

586
00:32:43,829 --> 00:32:44,949
how reckless you are?

587
00:32:45,069 --> 00:32:46,989
Rest assured.
I'll outsmart him this time.

588
00:32:51,029 --> 00:32:53,869
Reliable small investment brings
you a fortune for sure.

589
00:32:53,989 --> 00:32:55,429
You just have to invest RMB 198,000.

590
00:32:55,429 --> 00:32:56,989
You'll get RMB 396,000
in return at year-end.

591
00:32:56,989 --> 00:32:59,149
The return on investment is
up to 200 percent.

592
00:33:00,709 --> 00:33:01,389
What is this about?

593
00:33:01,749 --> 00:33:02,709
Why are you reading it?

594
00:33:03,069 --> 00:33:03,709
Go away.

595
00:33:04,469 --> 00:33:05,029
Mister,

596
00:33:05,469 --> 00:33:06,829
I want to remind you

597
00:33:06,829 --> 00:33:08,469
that you've miscalculated
the return on investment.

598
00:33:09,669 --> 00:33:10,269
What is wrong with it?

599
00:33:10,429 --> 00:33:11,869
198,000 times two.

600
00:33:11,869 --> 00:33:12,789
Two times eight is 16.

601
00:33:12,789 --> 00:33:14,269
Write six and carry one.
Two times nine is 18.

602
00:33:14,269 --> 00:33:16,069
19, it's 396,000.

603
00:33:16,069 --> 00:33:17,509
Invest RMB 198,000

604
00:33:17,629 --> 00:33:18,749
and net RMB 396,000 in profit,

605
00:33:18,749 --> 00:33:20,309
that's how you get
a rate of return of 200 percent.

606
00:33:20,469 --> 00:33:22,789
If you get RMB 396,000 in return,
that's a rate of return of 100 percent.

607
00:33:25,189 --> 00:33:25,909
Is that so?

608
00:33:26,829 --> 00:33:27,389
Mister,

609
00:33:27,789 --> 00:33:28,829
this is elementary mathematics.

610
00:33:29,309 --> 00:33:30,669
You never passed
your math exams, didn't you?

611
00:33:32,149 --> 00:33:33,109
I'm bad at math.

612
00:33:33,109 --> 00:33:34,749
But you're in no position to teach me.

613
00:33:34,749 --> 00:33:35,429
Go away.

614
00:33:35,429 --> 00:33:36,269
Stop messing around here.

615
00:33:36,989 --> 00:33:38,789
It's illegal to put up
false advertisement.

616
00:33:38,789 --> 00:33:40,829
I'm here just to remind you this.
Stop putting up the posters.

617
00:33:40,989 --> 00:33:42,429
This is my job.

618
00:33:42,629 --> 00:33:44,349
You're out of your depth.
Move aside.

619
00:33:44,509 --> 00:33:45,669
You put up the posters

620
00:33:45,669 --> 00:33:46,909
and I'll remove them.

621
00:33:46,909 --> 00:33:48,069
I'm in this.

622
00:33:50,469 --> 00:33:52,429
So it was you who removed
the posters I put up.

623
00:33:52,949 --> 00:33:54,629
It wasn't me who did it yesterday.

624
00:33:54,949 --> 00:33:56,309
But those posters you put up today,

625
00:33:56,509 --> 00:33:57,429
I'll be sure to remove them.

626
00:33:57,629 --> 00:33:58,829
Are you asking for a beating?

627
00:34:00,189 --> 00:34:00,629
You...

628
00:34:01,709 --> 00:34:02,749
How dare you avoid me?

629
00:34:02,749 --> 00:34:04,149
You're trying to beat me.
I'd be a fool if I didn't avoid it.

630
00:34:08,829 --> 00:34:10,149
What are you waiting for? Run!

631
00:34:14,709 --> 00:34:15,349
Stop right there!

632
00:34:16,269 --> 00:34:16,909
Stop!

633
00:34:17,149 --> 00:34:17,789
Xie Ang.

634
00:34:17,909 --> 00:34:18,749
Go get him.

635
00:34:21,349 --> 00:34:22,909
Troublemaker, stop right there!

636
00:34:23,389 --> 00:34:24,989
Mister, calm down.

637
00:34:25,629 --> 00:34:26,509
Don't move.

638
00:34:29,909 --> 00:34:30,669
Xie Ang.

639
00:34:43,269 --> 00:34:44,269
We're finally safe.

640
00:34:45,549 --> 00:34:47,109
Would you stop acting so recklessly?

641
00:34:47,109 --> 00:34:48,229
What if you really get beaten up?

642
00:34:48,229 --> 00:34:49,469
I still have you.

643
00:34:49,829 --> 00:34:51,789
Besides, that kick was really...

644
00:34:54,149 --> 00:34:55,549
Your... Where's your wheelchair?

645
00:34:55,909 --> 00:34:56,549
I lost it.

646
00:34:58,989 --> 00:34:59,709
You lost it?

647
00:35:01,469 --> 00:35:03,829
With a torn ligament,
a bruised cartilage of ankle

648
00:35:03,989 --> 00:35:04,789
and a fractured cartilage,

649
00:35:05,629 --> 00:35:06,509
how did you run so fast?

650
00:35:07,389 --> 00:35:08,949
I was eager to rescue you just now.

651
00:35:09,029 --> 00:35:10,269
Luckily, I have a strong body.

652
00:35:12,349 --> 00:35:13,389
It's starting to hurt again.

653
00:35:17,869 --> 00:35:18,989
It's that leg which's injured.

654
00:35:19,989 --> 00:35:21,429
Yes, this hurts more.

655
00:35:26,469 --> 00:35:29,349
So you've been lying to me
in the past few days, right?

656
00:35:33,949 --> 00:35:35,109
I did sprain my ankle.

657
00:35:36,309 --> 00:35:37,509
But it wasn't that serious.

658
00:35:38,229 --> 00:35:39,749
If so, why did you boss me around,

659
00:35:39,749 --> 00:35:40,589
ask me to run errands

660
00:35:40,589 --> 00:35:41,709
and serve you like a slave?

661
00:35:43,749 --> 00:35:45,269
Wasn't it your suggestion?

662
00:35:45,829 --> 00:35:46,749
I just went with it.

663
00:35:48,709 --> 00:35:49,349
Ji Junxing,

664
00:35:50,709 --> 00:35:51,629
do you think it's fun

665
00:35:51,629 --> 00:35:52,909
to toy with me and take advantage

666
00:35:53,589 --> 00:35:54,389
of my concern for you?

667
00:35:56,189 --> 00:35:57,749
It's not that fun.

668
00:35:58,269 --> 00:35:59,189
Actually, when you climbed
the tree yesterday,

669
00:35:59,189 --> 00:36:00,749
I was going to tell you the truth but...

670
00:36:00,749 --> 00:36:02,509
I thought you only had a long face

671
00:36:03,389 --> 00:36:04,669
and a bad temper.

672
00:36:05,269 --> 00:36:06,589
I didn't approach you in the right way.

673
00:36:06,589 --> 00:36:08,149
That's why you kept ignoring me.

674
00:36:11,149 --> 00:36:12,349
This is my wishful thinking.

675
00:36:14,229 --> 00:36:16,229
I shouldn't have approached you,
cared for you

676
00:36:16,229 --> 00:36:17,669
and had the idea
of making friends with you.

677
00:36:18,909 --> 00:36:20,909
Because people who make fun
of their health

678
00:36:21,309 --> 00:36:23,029
don't deserve others' concern.

679
00:36:25,789 --> 00:36:26,669
What has my health condition

680
00:36:26,669 --> 00:36:27,869
got to do with you?

681
00:36:29,109 --> 00:36:29,829
Besides,

682
00:36:29,829 --> 00:36:31,469
I took a joke on my own leg.

683
00:36:32,389 --> 00:36:33,309
Why are you so mad about it?

684
00:36:39,869 --> 00:36:40,949
Why am I so mad?

685
00:36:48,709 --> 00:36:49,349
What are you doing?

686
00:36:49,469 --> 00:36:49,989
Does it hurt?

687
00:36:50,189 --> 00:36:50,749
It does.

688
00:36:51,549 --> 00:36:52,589
Anyway, it's not my leg.

689
00:36:52,749 --> 00:36:53,709
It has nothing to do with me.

690
00:37:28,669 --> 00:37:30,269
The guest shuts the owner out.

691
00:37:30,389 --> 00:37:32,389
You occupy my place.
What an ungrateful person.

692
00:37:32,669 --> 00:37:33,909
I sincerely treated you.

693
00:37:33,909 --> 00:37:34,989
But you didn't appreciate it.

694
00:37:34,989 --> 00:37:36,429
How dare you get mad at me?

695
00:37:36,709 --> 00:37:37,429
What have I done wrong?

696
00:37:37,629 --> 00:37:38,229
I've only made you

697
00:37:38,229 --> 00:37:39,389
my sidekick for several days.

698
00:37:39,389 --> 00:37:41,469
I got punished, read an apology
and had nightmares because of you.

699
00:37:41,549 --> 00:37:43,069
You made a mess of my life.

700
00:37:43,149 --> 00:37:43,709
Yes.

701
00:37:44,189 --> 00:37:45,589
I did bring you some troubles.

702
00:37:45,829 --> 00:37:47,389
But at least, I was sincere.

703
00:37:47,749 --> 00:37:49,429
Unlike you, you're a trickster.

704
00:37:49,629 --> 00:37:50,989
What kind of a person is this?

705
00:37:50,989 --> 00:37:52,589
You're black-hearted
like the black sesame rice ball.

706
00:37:52,829 --> 00:37:53,789
I'm a bad person.

707
00:37:54,109 --> 00:37:55,149
Then, just ignore me.

708
00:37:55,469 --> 00:37:56,429
If it wasn't for my brother,

709
00:37:56,669 --> 00:37:58,109
I wouldn't have run errands for you.

710
00:37:58,509 --> 00:38:00,269
I'm not going to do it again.
Suit yourself.

711
00:38:01,269 --> 00:38:01,909
Perfect.

712
00:38:02,029 --> 00:38:03,229
It's less troublesome for me.

713
00:38:21,549 --> 00:38:23,829
This is hard.

714
00:38:25,669 --> 00:38:27,989
What do you think I should do?

715
00:38:31,989 --> 00:38:32,629
Come in.

716
00:38:36,789 --> 00:38:37,389
What do you want?

717
00:38:37,789 --> 00:38:38,469
It's for you.

718
00:38:42,229 --> 00:38:43,349
A fox.

719
00:38:43,949 --> 00:38:45,429
Why isn't it a bunny?

720
00:38:45,429 --> 00:38:46,749
A bunny is more lovely.

721
00:38:46,749 --> 00:38:48,309
The fox suits you more

722
00:38:48,309 --> 00:38:49,669
as you're full of tricks.

723
00:38:49,949 --> 00:38:50,789
Who told you that?

724
00:38:50,789 --> 00:38:51,869
I'm kind and lovely.

725
00:38:51,869 --> 00:38:52,949
How could I look like a fox?

726
00:38:53,589 --> 00:38:55,229
Both of you have
a common characteristic.

727
00:38:55,669 --> 00:38:56,709
You'll fight if you can.

728
00:38:56,709 --> 00:38:58,429
If you can't, you'll stay and watch.

729
00:38:58,429 --> 00:38:59,949
When the opponent is not aware,
you'll continue to fight.

730
00:39:00,309 --> 00:39:02,109
Anyway, you won't suffer losses.

731
00:39:03,949 --> 00:39:04,949
When the opponent is not aware?

732
00:39:05,629 --> 00:39:06,909
You're the opponent.

733
00:39:06,909 --> 00:39:08,229
I give you a present but you beat me.

734
00:39:08,229 --> 00:39:09,749
It's not my favorite thing.

735
00:39:22,029 --> 00:39:22,749
Yes.

736
00:39:23,189 --> 00:39:24,389
Who am I?

737
00:39:24,549 --> 00:39:26,149
How could I let others bully me?
