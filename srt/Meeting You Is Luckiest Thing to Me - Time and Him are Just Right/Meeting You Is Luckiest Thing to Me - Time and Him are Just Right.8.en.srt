18
00:01:44,524 --> 00:01:45,404
It snows.

19
00:01:55,564 --> 00:01:57,084
It's snowing.

20
00:01:57,564 --> 00:01:58,244
The weather broadcast

21
00:01:58,244 --> 00:02:00,484
didn't lie this time.

22
00:02:05,124 --> 00:02:06,164
I wish

23
00:02:07,284 --> 00:02:09,484
my family and Ji Junxing could be

24
00:02:10,804 --> 00:02:12,084
safe and sound,

25
00:02:13,324 --> 00:02:14,644
and everything will be well.

26
00:02:16,844 --> 00:02:17,404
Here.

27
00:02:18,164 --> 00:02:20,004
To the new year.

28
00:02:21,564 --> 00:02:22,564
To the first snowfall.

29
00:02:34,764 --> 00:02:35,884
What brings you here?

30
00:02:36,444 --> 00:02:37,444
Didn't someone say

31
00:02:37,444 --> 00:02:39,204
she wanted to have a hotpot
during the first snowfall?

32
00:02:40,364 --> 00:02:41,644
That's why I came.

33
00:02:42,964 --> 00:02:44,164
What about the performance?

34
00:02:45,564 --> 00:02:47,244
I can watch it at any time.

35
00:02:47,804 --> 00:02:48,924
However, the first snowfall

36
00:02:49,524 --> 00:02:50,884
only happens once.

37
00:03:34,124 --> 00:03:35,844
Isn't this the scarf I saw that day?

38
00:03:36,284 --> 00:03:36,924
Yes.

39
00:03:38,044 --> 00:03:39,844
This scarf suits you very well.

40
00:03:42,764 --> 00:03:43,644
What an ugly dummy.

41
00:03:44,164 --> 00:03:45,084
I'm not an ugly dummy.

42
00:03:45,164 --> 00:03:46,524
Let's go outside.

43
00:03:49,804 --> 00:03:51,564
Are you walking a dog?

44
00:03:54,444 --> 00:03:55,764
It snows quite hard.

45
00:03:56,124 --> 00:03:56,844
Look.

46
00:03:56,844 --> 00:03:58,084
Look at the roof over there.

47
00:03:59,764 --> 00:04:00,604
What's wrong with you?

48
00:04:01,244 --> 00:04:03,284
Are you out of breath?

49
00:04:06,964 --> 00:04:09,644
Don't tell me you ran here.

50
00:04:10,484 --> 00:04:11,044
Yes.

51
00:04:11,564 --> 00:04:12,564
I ran across several streets

52
00:04:13,204 --> 00:04:14,524
to look for you.

53
00:04:16,284 --> 00:04:17,644
I was worried
that the first snow stops

54
00:04:17,644 --> 00:04:18,844
before I get you.

55
00:04:23,844 --> 00:04:25,844
Why did you come here?

56
00:04:26,164 --> 00:04:27,324
Wouldn't it be more comfortable

57
00:04:27,324 --> 00:04:28,404
to watch the performance in the theatre?

58
00:04:31,684 --> 00:04:33,684
Because I believe what
a silly girl said.

59
00:04:34,644 --> 00:04:35,644
What is it?

60
00:04:43,204 --> 00:04:45,284
A miracle about the first snowfall.

61
00:05:08,580 --> 00:05:10,740
(Emergency Room)

62
00:05:14,324 --> 00:05:15,324
Please wait for a while.

63
00:05:15,324 --> 00:05:16,524
The doctor will be here soon.

64
00:05:16,524 --> 00:05:17,284
Sure.

65
00:05:23,004 --> 00:05:23,724
Tissue paper, please.

66
00:05:24,524 --> 00:05:26,324
We shouldn't have played in the snow.

67
00:05:27,204 --> 00:05:28,244
The first snow falls

68
00:05:28,244 --> 00:05:29,244
upon two patients.

69
00:05:30,924 --> 00:05:31,964
I haven't had the pleasure yet.

70
00:05:31,964 --> 00:05:33,044
Let's go out again

71
00:05:33,044 --> 00:05:33,804
if the snow doesn't stop.

72
00:05:34,084 --> 00:05:35,444
We shall listen to what the doctor says.

73
00:05:45,804 --> 00:05:46,884
What's wrong with you?

74
00:05:47,964 --> 00:05:49,404
I've got a headache.

75
00:05:49,404 --> 00:05:50,644
Perhaps it's a fever.

76
00:05:51,804 --> 00:05:52,924
Let me take your temperature.

77
00:05:58,164 --> 00:05:59,524
36.5 degrees.

78
00:05:59,524 --> 00:06:00,004
All right.

79
00:06:00,004 --> 00:06:00,644
You're fine.

80
00:06:05,164 --> 00:06:06,124
Your temperature is quite high.

81
00:06:06,284 --> 00:06:07,564
It's 38.7 degrees.

82
00:06:07,924 --> 00:06:09,404
I'm the only one who gets a fever,
right?

83
00:06:09,404 --> 00:06:10,164
Yes.

84
00:06:12,404 --> 00:06:13,404
Oh, good.

85
00:06:15,124 --> 00:06:16,164
Good?

86
00:06:16,404 --> 00:06:17,764
What do you mean?

87
00:06:19,284 --> 00:06:20,644
Doctor, she can't think straight
with a fever.

88
00:06:24,444 --> 00:06:25,204
My goodness.

89
00:06:25,444 --> 00:06:26,724
You youngsters

90
00:06:26,804 --> 00:06:28,084
are so crazy

91
00:06:28,364 --> 00:06:29,564
about the first snowfall

92
00:06:29,724 --> 00:06:31,204
even at the cost of your health.

93
00:07:06,284 --> 00:07:07,044
Lin Xi.

94
00:07:07,964 --> 00:07:08,964
Lin Xi.

95
00:07:09,844 --> 00:07:11,244
Lin Xi.

96
00:07:11,924 --> 00:07:12,724
Get up.

97
00:07:12,724 --> 00:07:14,324
You will catch a cold
lying in the snow.

98
00:07:21,724 --> 00:07:22,604
I have something for you.

99
00:07:26,604 --> 00:07:28,044
This is cute.

100
00:07:28,044 --> 00:07:29,204
It looks like a real duck.

101
00:07:31,204 --> 00:07:33,204
It's smooth

102
00:07:33,564 --> 00:07:34,804
and warm.

103
00:08:00,884 --> 00:08:02,444
It's a dream.

104
00:08:11,444 --> 00:08:12,684
Good morning, Madam Wen.

105
00:08:13,004 --> 00:08:13,964
You are up.

106
00:08:14,364 --> 00:08:15,484
Take a seat over there.

107
00:08:15,484 --> 00:08:16,444
I'm cooking the congee.

108
00:08:16,444 --> 00:08:17,244
It will be done soon.

109
00:08:17,244 --> 00:08:18,164
Thank you.

110
00:08:18,164 --> 00:08:18,724
Sure.

111
00:08:21,964 --> 00:08:22,804
Do you feel better now?

112
00:08:23,164 --> 00:08:24,164
I measured the temperature just now.

113
00:08:24,164 --> 00:08:25,004
37 degrees.

114
00:08:25,004 --> 00:08:26,484
I'm revived.

115
00:08:27,284 --> 00:08:28,924
You seem to be having
a good sleep last night.

116
00:08:29,684 --> 00:08:30,724
Yes.

117
00:08:30,724 --> 00:08:32,044
I made a dream about my...

118
00:08:34,124 --> 00:08:36,084
Someone made me a snow duck.

119
00:08:36,324 --> 00:08:37,884
It was so adorable.

120
00:08:38,604 --> 00:08:40,284
Did you hold it the entire night

121
00:08:40,524 --> 00:08:41,884
without letting it go?

122
00:08:42,804 --> 00:08:43,964
How did you know?

123
00:08:46,244 --> 00:08:48,044
That duck came to me in my dream.

124
00:08:48,804 --> 00:08:49,884
As if.

125
00:08:52,124 --> 00:08:54,084
What did it say to you?

126
00:08:54,604 --> 00:08:55,644
The duck told me

127
00:08:55,644 --> 00:08:56,964
never to give my hand to someone

128
00:08:56,964 --> 00:08:58,524
who grabbed a duck in her dream.

129
00:09:00,204 --> 00:09:01,564
The duck I grabbed was...

130
00:09:05,244 --> 00:09:06,004
Look at the scratches.

131
00:09:11,084 --> 00:09:13,724
I was grabbing your hand?

132
00:09:14,084 --> 00:09:15,244
What do you think?

133
00:09:16,564 --> 00:09:18,084
It's smooth.

134
00:09:29,644 --> 00:09:30,924
I'm so sorry.

135
00:09:31,804 --> 00:09:33,924
I thought I was in the hospital.

136
00:09:34,164 --> 00:09:35,764
Why did I wake up in my room?

137
00:09:36,244 --> 00:09:37,524
I carried you back.

138
00:09:39,884 --> 00:09:40,764
You must have suffered a lot.

139
00:09:41,844 --> 00:09:42,884
Not really.

140
00:09:42,884 --> 00:09:43,964
My mother went to pick us up

141
00:09:43,964 --> 00:09:44,964
after getting off work.

142
00:09:48,684 --> 00:09:50,644
Anyway, thank you for taking care of me.

143
00:09:51,124 --> 00:09:52,804
I will repay your kindness
when there is a chance.

144
00:09:54,364 --> 00:09:55,644
There is a chance now.

145
00:10:01,884 --> 00:10:03,324
Do you have a fever too?

146
00:10:03,564 --> 00:10:04,684
Obviously.

147
00:10:05,324 --> 00:10:06,804
Breakfast time.

148
00:10:07,604 --> 00:10:08,684
Coming, mum.

149
00:10:19,564 --> 00:10:21,604
Here you are, the congee.

150
00:10:22,164 --> 00:10:23,844
I cooked it this morning.

151
00:10:23,844 --> 00:10:24,284
Thank you, mum.

152
00:10:24,284 --> 00:10:25,044
Thank you, Madam Wen.

153
00:10:25,484 --> 00:10:26,204
Have a taste.

154
00:10:33,324 --> 00:10:35,284
Mum, is this congee?

155
00:10:36,844 --> 00:10:37,524
Madam Wen.

156
00:10:37,804 --> 00:10:39,524
The congee is kind of thick.

157
00:10:40,644 --> 00:10:41,724
It shouldn't be.

158
00:10:41,724 --> 00:10:43,564
How come it has become rice?

159
00:10:44,004 --> 00:10:45,804
I will add some water to it.

160
00:10:46,724 --> 00:10:47,364
No need.

161
00:10:49,604 --> 00:10:51,684
Madam Wen, you are leaving for work,
aren't you?

162
00:10:51,684 --> 00:10:52,324
That's right, mum.

163
00:10:52,324 --> 00:10:53,644
You will be late for work.

164
00:10:54,884 --> 00:10:55,884
No.

165
00:10:55,884 --> 00:10:57,564
I have called in sick for you.

166
00:10:58,044 --> 00:10:59,804
There is the flu going around.

167
00:10:59,804 --> 00:11:01,404
Besides, you are sick now

168
00:11:01,404 --> 00:11:02,964
and you can't eat outside food.

169
00:11:03,404 --> 00:11:04,524
I will just add some water to it.

170
00:11:04,804 --> 00:11:05,564
Mum.

171
00:11:05,564 --> 00:11:07,004
Isn't it a waste of talent

172
00:11:07,004 --> 00:11:07,964
for an Art Director like you

173
00:11:07,964 --> 00:11:09,404
to look after us at home?

174
00:11:09,644 --> 00:11:10,244
Indeed.

175
00:11:10,244 --> 00:11:12,524
It's like using a sledgehammer
to crack a nut.

176
00:11:12,524 --> 00:11:13,284
Exactly.

177
00:11:13,644 --> 00:11:15,364
You should go to work, Madam Wen.

178
00:11:15,724 --> 00:11:16,484
We are grown-ups

179
00:11:16,484 --> 00:11:17,524
who can take care of ourselves.

180
00:11:17,524 --> 00:11:18,244
She's right, mum.

181
00:11:18,244 --> 00:11:19,044
Don't worry about us.

182
00:11:19,044 --> 00:11:20,204
We will take great care of each other.

183
00:11:21,524 --> 00:11:22,484
You really don't need me here?

184
00:11:22,924 --> 00:11:23,804
- No.
- No.

185
00:11:30,484 --> 00:11:31,364
Ji Junxing.

186
00:11:34,844 --> 00:11:36,364
Ji Junxing, take the medicine.

187
00:11:39,044 --> 00:11:40,164
He's asleep.

188
00:11:43,644 --> 00:11:45,364
He didn't tuck in well.

189
00:12:42,404 --> 00:12:43,364
What are you doing?

190
00:12:46,364 --> 00:12:47,604
I'm looking for my handphone.

191
00:12:48,004 --> 00:12:49,364
I put it here just now.

192
00:12:49,764 --> 00:12:50,844
Would it be on the floor?

193
00:12:51,564 --> 00:12:52,924
You're holding your phone though.

194
00:12:55,884 --> 00:12:56,564
I told you.

195
00:12:56,564 --> 00:12:57,484
It's just around here.

196
00:12:58,084 --> 00:12:59,444
Remember to take the medicine.

197
00:13:15,044 --> 00:13:18,804
Come on.

198
00:13:19,964 --> 00:13:20,644
Finally, we got up here.

199
00:13:21,284 --> 00:13:22,924
How come you have put on some weight

200
00:13:23,364 --> 00:13:24,884
after falling sick?

201
00:13:27,084 --> 00:13:29,004
I didn't complain anything

202
00:13:29,004 --> 00:13:30,524
when I took someone with a broken leg
up here.

203
00:13:31,244 --> 00:13:32,724
Oh, you have a good memory.

204
00:13:33,604 --> 00:13:36,044
I even remember a heartless chap

205
00:13:36,044 --> 00:13:37,964
who left me alone with a load of jobs.

206
00:13:39,124 --> 00:13:40,444
Well. Do you still remember

207
00:13:40,444 --> 00:13:41,804
a hardworking chap

208
00:13:41,804 --> 00:13:43,404
who removed all the posters
without complaints

209
00:13:43,404 --> 00:13:44,204
in just one night?

210
00:13:44,964 --> 00:13:45,684
That was...

211
00:13:47,524 --> 00:13:48,724
Was that you?

212
00:13:49,084 --> 00:13:50,084
I'm a heartless chap.

213
00:13:50,084 --> 00:13:50,644
How could it be me?

214
00:13:51,084 --> 00:13:52,804
It was you.

215
00:13:52,804 --> 00:13:53,564
Why didn't you tell me?

216
00:13:53,564 --> 00:13:54,884
It wasn't me.

217
00:13:54,884 --> 00:13:55,964
It was you.

218
00:13:56,804 --> 00:13:57,844
Why did you hide it?

219
00:13:57,844 --> 00:13:58,884
I'm sure it was you.

220
00:14:03,084 --> 00:14:03,924
Good morning.

221
00:14:04,324 --> 00:14:05,604
You're finally back, Lin Xi.

222
00:14:05,604 --> 00:14:07,324
Xing, I miss you so much.

223
00:14:07,324 --> 00:14:08,084
Do you miss me?

224
00:14:08,084 --> 00:14:08,844
Not at all.

225
00:14:09,484 --> 00:14:10,764
To welcome you back,

226
00:14:10,764 --> 00:14:12,284
we have prepared a wonderful present
for you.

227
00:14:12,644 --> 00:14:13,244
Take it.

228
00:14:13,844 --> 00:14:14,844
What's it?

229
00:14:14,844 --> 00:14:16,124
Is it something delicious?

230
00:14:16,684 --> 00:14:18,604
They are the lecture notes, test papers,

231
00:14:18,604 --> 00:14:20,164
practice books, correction books
and three essays

232
00:14:20,164 --> 00:14:21,244
during your absence.

233
00:14:21,244 --> 00:14:22,764
Surprise!

234
00:14:24,124 --> 00:14:25,684
All of us sorted out the notes

235
00:14:25,684 --> 00:14:27,204
of the lectures you missed.

236
00:14:27,204 --> 00:14:28,484
I was absent for a few days though.

237
00:14:28,764 --> 00:14:30,044
Why so many?

238
00:14:30,044 --> 00:14:31,164
Indeed.

239
00:14:31,164 --> 00:14:32,764
The key high school lives the time
like the heavenly palace

240
00:14:32,764 --> 00:14:34,124
where one day equals one year
of mortal time.

241
00:14:34,124 --> 00:14:35,044
Hence, you have missed out

242
00:14:35,044 --> 00:14:36,044
on three years of lectures.

243
00:14:36,484 --> 00:14:37,644
Good. I can graduate now.

244
00:14:43,244 --> 00:14:45,044
Isn't this the syllabus
for the next semester?

245
00:14:46,644 --> 00:14:47,724
According to Chunhui's customs,

246
00:14:47,724 --> 00:14:49,364
the final week's lectures include
the syllabus for the next semester.

247
00:14:50,084 --> 00:14:51,364
Besides, it would be tested

248
00:14:51,364 --> 00:14:52,524
in the final exam too.

249
00:15:01,124 --> 00:15:01,924
Lin Xi.

250
00:15:04,004 --> 00:15:05,164
Did anything

251
00:15:05,164 --> 00:15:06,364
get you distracted?

252
00:15:07,124 --> 00:15:08,284
I'm worried

253
00:15:08,564 --> 00:15:10,484
because I've missed out on the lectures
and the exam

254
00:15:10,484 --> 00:15:11,284
includes the syllabus
from next semester.

255
00:15:11,644 --> 00:15:12,244
Fret not.

256
00:15:12,244 --> 00:15:13,724
That part won't take up
a big weightage of the total mark.

257
00:15:14,044 --> 00:15:14,964
You may not know about this.

258
00:15:14,964 --> 00:15:16,204
I promised my mum

259
00:15:16,204 --> 00:15:17,564
that I would go back home
only if I do well in the exam.

260
00:15:18,404 --> 00:15:18,884
Maybe

261
00:15:18,884 --> 00:15:20,444
I can help you
with the lecture you missed.

262
00:15:20,444 --> 00:15:21,244
Sure.

263
00:15:24,444 --> 00:15:25,244
Hold on.

264
00:15:25,724 --> 00:15:27,124
It was a whimsy thought of mine.

265
00:15:27,124 --> 00:15:28,444
Don't take it seriously.

266
00:15:28,444 --> 00:15:30,164
I'm hanging on by a thread

267
00:15:30,164 --> 00:15:31,884
and I don't want to drag you down
with me.

268
00:15:31,884 --> 00:15:33,244
You did excellent in your English essay.

269
00:15:33,244 --> 00:15:34,324
Even Miss Sun
praised you for that.

270
00:15:34,684 --> 00:15:35,844
You're of enough capability

271
00:15:35,844 --> 00:15:36,804
to help me with it.

272
00:15:39,884 --> 00:15:41,564
Give me some time to think about it.

273
00:15:43,964 --> 00:15:44,884
Mianmian, please.

274
00:15:50,604 --> 00:15:51,444
Lin Xi.

275
00:15:52,684 --> 00:15:54,404
After careful consideration,

276
00:15:54,844 --> 00:15:57,524
it's more reliable to have a team
to help you.

277
00:15:58,364 --> 00:16:01,204
From today on,

278
00:16:01,844 --> 00:16:04,524
every one of us will
do the revision with you.

279
00:16:06,084 --> 00:16:07,844
Brilliant idea.

280
00:16:07,844 --> 00:16:08,684
Every one of us

281
00:16:08,684 --> 00:16:10,444
does great in different subjects.

282
00:16:10,444 --> 00:16:11,444
We can tutor you one by one.

283
00:16:12,924 --> 00:16:13,844
That's right.

284
00:16:14,244 --> 00:16:15,924
Three ignorant cobblers
add up to a genius.

285
00:16:16,284 --> 00:16:18,044
Besides, we have Ji Junxing here.

286
00:16:18,484 --> 00:16:19,044
Exactly.

287
00:16:19,924 --> 00:16:21,604
Didn't you miss the lecture
just like me?

288
00:16:22,804 --> 00:16:23,564
I've already studied

289
00:16:23,564 --> 00:16:24,764
the next semester's syllabus.

290
00:16:24,764 --> 00:16:25,644
It should be no problem

291
00:16:25,644 --> 00:16:26,484
to help you with the lecture you missed.

292
00:16:26,484 --> 00:16:27,644
I see.

293
00:16:28,004 --> 00:16:30,324
It turns out you are studying secretly
behind my back.

294
00:16:35,284 --> 00:16:38,244
Well, I shall thank you in advance.

295
00:16:38,684 --> 00:16:39,684
You're welcome.

296
00:16:46,644 --> 00:16:47,844
Why don't we make something fun
out of the revision?

297
00:16:48,204 --> 00:16:49,164
Let's have a competition

298
00:16:49,164 --> 00:16:50,244
to motivate us.

299
00:16:51,124 --> 00:16:51,844
What kind of competition?

300
00:16:52,444 --> 00:16:54,244
The tutor who's in charge of the subject

301
00:16:54,244 --> 00:16:55,084
in which she gets the lowest mark

302
00:16:55,084 --> 00:16:56,244
has to treat us to a hotpot.

303
00:16:56,244 --> 00:16:57,084
That's great.

304
00:16:57,084 --> 00:16:58,684
I will go all out for the hotpot.

305
00:17:03,964 --> 00:17:05,644
5 Model Tests and 3 Past Exam Papers?

306
00:17:06,204 --> 00:17:07,484
Is this a pirated reference book?

307
00:17:07,844 --> 00:17:09,804
It's the treasure of my dad.

308
00:17:10,244 --> 00:17:12,044
No, it's the arcane treasure.

309
00:17:12,484 --> 00:17:13,644
He uses it to prepare the test paper.

310
00:17:13,884 --> 00:17:15,084
There are important points
for Grade Three's syllabus.

311
00:17:15,084 --> 00:17:16,764
You will get high marks
after completing these papers.

312
00:17:17,084 --> 00:17:18,124
Let's take an example.

313
00:17:18,404 --> 00:17:19,444
This question is difficult
as you have to draw

314
00:17:19,804 --> 00:17:20,644
the auxiliary line.

315
00:17:20,644 --> 00:17:21,364
It took some days for my dad

316
00:17:21,364 --> 00:17:22,044
to explain to me.

317
00:17:22,364 --> 00:17:23,684
I'm sure you don't know about this too.

318
00:17:23,684 --> 00:17:25,084
Anyway, I will teach you patiently.

319
00:17:25,604 --> 00:17:27,404
Should I draw the line here?

320
00:17:30,004 --> 00:17:30,964
How did you know?

321
00:17:31,204 --> 00:17:32,884
I learnt it from the Olympiad math.

322
00:17:33,804 --> 00:17:35,924
Are you the one
who needs guidance?

323
00:17:45,844 --> 00:17:47,444
Do you know
why people find English difficult?

324
00:17:48,164 --> 00:17:49,564
I don't think it's difficult.

325
00:17:50,564 --> 00:17:51,244
Well, do you know

326
00:17:51,244 --> 00:17:53,404
how to create
an English-speaking environment?

327
00:17:54,004 --> 00:17:55,284
We have to go abroad.

328
00:17:56,884 --> 00:17:57,724
Well.

329
00:17:58,004 --> 00:17:58,564
I know

330
00:17:58,564 --> 00:18:00,324
you are going to introduce new songs
of your idol.

331
00:18:00,604 --> 00:18:01,764
You indeed know me well.

332
00:18:02,084 --> 00:18:03,084
Experts said

333
00:18:03,084 --> 00:18:04,844
that listening to songs
helps to learn effectively

334
00:18:04,844 --> 00:18:06,124
and train our listening skills.

335
00:18:13,844 --> 00:18:15,124
Choose A for this.

336
00:18:15,124 --> 00:18:15,964
It's easy.

337
00:18:16,244 --> 00:18:17,764
Choose B for this.

338
00:18:17,764 --> 00:18:18,644
Without question.

339
00:18:19,564 --> 00:18:21,884
I don't think you need me
for the last question.

340
00:18:22,084 --> 00:18:23,364
Considering your intelligence,

341
00:18:23,604 --> 00:18:25,364
this is a giveaway question.

342
00:18:25,364 --> 00:18:26,604
Not really.

343
00:18:26,844 --> 00:18:27,724
Well.

344
00:18:28,044 --> 00:18:29,764
I can't solve the last question.

345
00:18:32,244 --> 00:18:33,284
To be honest,

346
00:18:33,284 --> 00:18:34,844
I can't solve it either.

347
00:18:36,004 --> 00:18:37,244
Electromagnetic force

348
00:18:37,244 --> 00:18:40,844
compasses electricity,
magnetism and light.

349
00:18:41,204 --> 00:18:42,724
Hence, they make up
the electromagnetic force.

350
00:18:43,004 --> 00:18:44,244
Paul Davies said

351
00:18:44,484 --> 00:18:47,044
when humans integrate all the forces

352
00:18:47,044 --> 00:18:48,684
into one super force,

353
00:18:49,084 --> 00:18:51,604
they can combine and
change particles randomly.

354
00:18:52,204 --> 00:18:53,804
Particle physicists discover

355
00:18:54,164 --> 00:18:57,404
that a vacuum is not an absolute void.

356
00:18:57,404 --> 00:19:00,164
A Higgs field exists.

357
00:19:00,164 --> 00:19:01,484
We can regard it

358
00:19:01,484 --> 00:19:04,724
as an elaborate snowfield.

359
00:19:05,884 --> 00:19:06,724
Hold on.

360
00:19:06,724 --> 00:19:09,124
Are you talking about the knowledge
from the college?

361
00:19:11,644 --> 00:19:12,564
I'm sorry.

362
00:19:12,964 --> 00:19:13,884
It's out of our syllabus.

363
00:19:15,044 --> 00:19:15,404
Tasty.

364
00:19:15,404 --> 00:19:16,084
Yummy.

365
00:19:16,084 --> 00:19:16,924
Everything tastes so good.

366
00:19:17,244 --> 00:19:18,404
Mianmian, taste it.

367
00:19:18,524 --> 00:19:18,964
Not bad.

368
00:19:18,964 --> 00:19:19,484
What about this?

369
00:19:19,484 --> 00:19:20,284
Taste it.

370
00:19:20,764 --> 00:19:21,724
This is nice.

371
00:19:21,724 --> 00:19:22,964
Mianmian, give me one.

372
00:19:23,604 --> 00:19:24,684
That is good too.

373
00:19:29,604 --> 00:19:30,564
Why zoning out?

374
00:19:33,084 --> 00:19:33,764
Yes.

375
00:19:34,724 --> 00:19:37,004
I feel like I'm walking
in a boundless snowfield

376
00:19:37,204 --> 00:19:40,564
with dim light.

377
00:19:40,924 --> 00:19:43,284
However, I can't feel
the snow specifically,

378
00:19:43,964 --> 00:19:47,084
but only an endless white scene
before me.

379
00:19:50,764 --> 00:19:51,924
You aren't burning up.

380
00:19:52,204 --> 00:19:53,324
What nonsense are you talking about?

381
00:19:53,764 --> 00:19:55,444
I was quite sober.

382
00:19:55,924 --> 00:19:57,804
But I feel giddy now.

383
00:19:58,244 --> 00:19:59,764
After the revision,

384
00:20:00,204 --> 00:20:01,484
my confidence level

385
00:20:01,484 --> 00:20:03,924
dropped from eighty per cent
to sixty per cent.

386
00:20:05,204 --> 00:20:06,724
It's just an exam.

387
00:20:06,724 --> 00:20:08,164
You weren't this nervous before though.

388
00:20:08,484 --> 00:20:09,724
It's a different case this time.

389
00:20:10,004 --> 00:20:11,884
I must pass the exam with flying colors
before the Chinese New Year.

390
00:20:12,484 --> 00:20:13,964
Otherwise, I can't image

391
00:20:14,284 --> 00:20:15,804
how gloomy and pitiful

392
00:20:15,804 --> 00:20:17,164
my winter break will be.

393
00:20:17,684 --> 00:20:19,484
Probably you won't see me

394
00:20:19,484 --> 00:20:20,964
after the break.

395
00:20:21,404 --> 00:20:22,324
Don't make it so seriously.

396
00:20:22,324 --> 00:20:23,484
Let me tell you this.

397
00:20:23,764 --> 00:20:24,604
My dad is the plus version

398
00:20:24,604 --> 00:20:25,684
of Mr. Xie.

399
00:20:25,884 --> 00:20:26,884
He will break my legs

400
00:20:27,044 --> 00:20:28,444
if I fail the exam.

401
00:20:28,684 --> 00:20:30,204
If so, you can get a wheelchair
to the school.

402
00:20:30,204 --> 00:20:31,404
I will take care of you this time.

403
00:20:31,924 --> 00:20:33,564
Are you leaving me to die?

404
00:20:35,084 --> 00:20:37,364
You're the most reliable one
amongst them.

405
00:20:39,084 --> 00:20:39,724
I don't care.

406
00:20:39,724 --> 00:20:41,164
The health of my leg depends on you.

407
00:20:41,484 --> 00:20:42,924
Help me.

408
00:20:43,364 --> 00:20:44,164
Help me with the revision. Please.

409
00:20:44,164 --> 00:20:45,244
All right.

410
00:22:07,684 --> 00:22:09,244
I heard that the result of
the monthly test will be out soon.

411
00:22:10,124 --> 00:22:11,564
I suppose

412
00:22:11,964 --> 00:22:12,964
the full ranking of the grade

413
00:22:12,964 --> 00:22:14,124
will be announced one week later
at least.

414
00:22:16,124 --> 00:22:17,764
This is torturing.

415
00:22:18,364 --> 00:22:20,044
Are you curious about your result?

416
00:22:21,444 --> 00:22:22,764
I have it with me.

417
00:22:24,684 --> 00:22:25,804
Where did you get this?

418
00:22:25,804 --> 00:22:27,124
From Miss Sun.

419
00:22:27,324 --> 00:22:28,324
You are really something.

420
00:22:28,324 --> 00:22:29,364
Hurry up. Reveal the result.

421
00:22:29,724 --> 00:22:31,004
Chen Mo, you are the 6th.

422
00:22:31,324 --> 00:22:32,444
Well done, Chen Mo.

423
00:22:32,444 --> 00:22:33,324
Excellent.

424
00:22:33,324 --> 00:22:34,644
Lucky six.

425
00:22:34,644 --> 00:22:35,684
What about me?

426
00:22:35,924 --> 00:22:37,604
The 22nd place.

427
00:22:38,164 --> 00:22:39,404
I got the same rank thrice.

428
00:22:39,404 --> 00:22:41,004
What's gotten into me?

429
00:22:41,764 --> 00:22:43,484
You made progress
as long as you don't regress.

430
00:22:44,564 --> 00:22:45,764
As for Xie Ang...

431
00:22:45,764 --> 00:22:46,404
Wait.

432
00:22:46,844 --> 00:22:48,164
Whose ranking is higher, Xie Ang or me?

433
00:22:49,604 --> 00:22:50,684
Xie Ang, the 25th.

434
00:22:50,684 --> 00:22:52,124
You got the 27th.

435
00:22:53,724 --> 00:22:54,444
I'm sorry for that.

436
00:22:54,724 --> 00:22:55,444
However,

437
00:22:55,724 --> 00:22:57,604
your maths result
is a breakthrough this time.

438
00:22:57,884 --> 00:22:58,644
For real?

439
00:22:58,644 --> 00:22:59,084
Let me see.

440
00:22:59,084 --> 00:23:00,004
Seriously?

441
00:23:00,724 --> 00:23:01,924
101 marks.

442
00:23:01,924 --> 00:23:03,204
It's my first time getting this result.

443
00:23:03,204 --> 00:23:04,204
Lin Xi.

444
00:23:04,604 --> 00:23:06,164
I can finally hold my head high.

445
00:23:06,164 --> 00:23:07,204
Hold it for me. I want to
take a photo of my result.

446
00:23:10,284 --> 00:23:11,524
I heard that someone sacrificed

447
00:23:11,524 --> 00:23:13,004
his precious time for revision

448
00:23:13,484 --> 00:23:15,164
and rendered the Xie's
exclusive arcane treasure.

449
00:23:15,924 --> 00:23:16,924
Who's that kind-hearted person?

450
00:23:18,164 --> 00:23:19,244
Sure, he's indeed kind.

451
00:23:19,924 --> 00:23:21,084
You're the fine one to talk.

452
00:23:21,084 --> 00:23:22,484
You said the book is an arcane treasure

453
00:23:22,484 --> 00:23:23,564
and the confirmed questions in the test.

454
00:23:24,044 --> 00:23:25,404
I was burning midnight oils

455
00:23:25,404 --> 00:23:26,404
studying that for several days.

456
00:23:26,404 --> 00:23:27,204
Yet none of them was in the paper.

457
00:23:27,964 --> 00:23:28,964
Get lost.

458
00:23:29,724 --> 00:23:30,404
What about me?

459
00:23:30,964 --> 00:23:32,244
What about my scores?

460
00:23:33,564 --> 00:23:34,404
Since they've known about theirs,

461
00:23:34,404 --> 00:23:35,084
what about mine?

462
00:23:36,044 --> 00:23:36,884
I got first place.

463
00:23:36,884 --> 00:23:37,484
You're slightly inferior to me.

464
00:23:37,484 --> 00:23:38,324
You're the second.

465
00:23:39,164 --> 00:23:40,124
Don't lie.

466
00:23:42,364 --> 00:23:43,724
You have your limbs

467
00:23:43,724 --> 00:23:44,924
kept in check now.

468
00:23:45,564 --> 00:23:46,924
699 marks.

469
00:23:47,364 --> 00:23:48,604
This is the pass allowing me to go home.

470
00:23:48,604 --> 00:23:49,204
Buddies.

471
00:23:49,444 --> 00:23:50,604
I will buy you a treat.

472
00:23:50,604 --> 00:23:51,084
Good.

473
00:23:51,084 --> 00:23:52,044
Thank you.

474
00:23:52,044 --> 00:23:52,644
Let's eat.

475
00:23:52,644 --> 00:23:53,524
Hold on.

476
00:23:53,524 --> 00:23:55,284
Someone has to treat us to a hotpot.

477
00:23:55,284 --> 00:23:56,244
We agreed on this before.

478
00:23:56,244 --> 00:23:58,044
The tutor of the subject
with the lowest score

479
00:23:58,044 --> 00:23:59,164
should buy us a meal.

480
00:23:59,164 --> 00:23:59,764
That's right.

481
00:24:00,124 --> 00:24:00,684
Let's take a guess.

482
00:24:00,684 --> 00:24:01,764
Who's that unlucky sod?

483
00:24:02,044 --> 00:24:03,164
I guess

484
00:24:03,164 --> 00:24:04,284
it must be Chinese Literature.

485
00:24:05,844 --> 00:24:08,204
Xing, it's not all your fault.

486
00:24:08,204 --> 00:24:09,644
The test was really difficult.

487
00:24:09,644 --> 00:24:10,684
It's out of the question

488
00:24:10,684 --> 00:24:11,884
to obtain high marks in that.

489
00:24:12,364 --> 00:24:13,324
Bad guess.

490
00:24:13,324 --> 00:24:14,124
It's maths.

491
00:24:15,204 --> 00:24:17,364
Lin Xi got 135 scores
for Chinese Literature

492
00:24:17,724 --> 00:24:18,844
and 134 scores for maths.

493
00:24:19,284 --> 00:24:20,524
For real?

494
00:24:22,604 --> 00:24:23,764
How could it be possible?

495
00:24:24,164 --> 00:24:24,924
Lin Xi.

496
00:24:25,284 --> 00:24:27,004
You've let me down.

497
00:24:27,004 --> 00:24:28,524
I'm sorry for that.

498
00:24:28,884 --> 00:24:35,084
- Hotpot.
- Hotpot.

499
00:24:35,084 --> 00:24:36,124
Let's go, comrades.

500
00:24:36,124 --> 00:24:37,004
Let's go.

501
00:24:39,604 --> 00:24:40,644
Let's eat.

502
00:24:41,684 --> 00:24:42,604
Let's go.

503
00:24:43,404 --> 00:24:44,604
(Falling For Malatang)
Come on in.

504
00:24:44,604 --> 00:24:45,084
(Falling For Malatang)

505
00:24:45,084 --> 00:24:46,764
(Falling For Malatang)
I thought we are having a hotpot.

506
00:24:46,764 --> 00:24:48,164
(Falling For Malatang)
Why malatang?

507
00:24:48,164 --> 00:24:49,964
Xie Ang, this is lame.

508
00:24:50,084 --> 00:24:51,484
Oh, let me tell you this.

509
00:24:51,484 --> 00:24:52,884
Hotpot is like when a group of people
have malatang.

510
00:24:52,884 --> 00:24:53,644
While malatang

511
00:24:53,644 --> 00:24:54,604
is a single serving of hotpot.

512
00:24:54,964 --> 00:24:56,364
Besides, the east gate
is where we used to gather.

513
00:24:56,364 --> 00:24:57,364
Shouldn't we show some support

514
00:24:57,364 --> 00:24:58,604
for the owner's new store?

515
00:24:59,284 --> 00:25:00,084
Sounds reasonable.

516
00:25:00,444 --> 00:25:01,924
Do keep your wallet well.

517
00:25:04,244 --> 00:25:05,124
What are you plotting?

518
00:25:05,124 --> 00:25:06,724
I want ten skewers of pork loin.

519
00:25:06,724 --> 00:25:07,364
Gao Yunlang.

520
00:25:07,764 --> 00:25:09,684
Are you sure you can finish all that?

521
00:25:09,684 --> 00:25:10,724
Take some vegetables.

522
00:25:10,724 --> 00:25:11,924
A balanced diet of vegetables
and meat is good for your health.

523
00:25:12,844 --> 00:25:14,444
Just take all you want.

524
00:25:14,444 --> 00:25:15,564
We shall eat to our heart's content

525
00:25:15,564 --> 00:25:16,964
as Mr. Xie is paying for the meal.

526
00:25:16,964 --> 00:25:17,444
Please don't.

527
00:25:17,444 --> 00:25:18,044
If you eat to your heart's content,

528
00:25:18,044 --> 00:25:19,124
my heart will break.

529
00:25:19,124 --> 00:25:20,604
Lin Xi. These foods are unhealthy.

530
00:25:20,604 --> 00:25:21,484
Eat less.

531
00:25:21,484 --> 00:25:22,684
I like unhealthy food though.

532
00:25:22,924 --> 00:25:23,804
Besides, didn't you say

533
00:25:23,804 --> 00:25:25,164
that one will be upset
if he can't savor the malatang?

534
00:25:25,164 --> 00:25:25,844
That's right.

535
00:25:26,284 --> 00:25:27,764
I will take ten skewers
of roasted sausage.

536
00:25:28,444 --> 00:25:29,484
Chen Mo.

537
00:25:30,124 --> 00:25:31,724
Don't be influenced by them.

538
00:25:31,724 --> 00:25:32,524
I'm so hungry today

539
00:25:32,524 --> 00:25:34,084
for no reason.

540
00:25:35,604 --> 00:25:37,284
Xing, you're the kindest one to me.

541
00:25:37,644 --> 00:25:39,124
I will take mineral water, okay?

542
00:25:39,404 --> 00:25:40,004
Good.

543
00:25:40,004 --> 00:25:40,964
Take two if you want.

544
00:25:40,964 --> 00:25:41,604
Sir.

545
00:25:42,004 --> 00:25:43,004
Give me two bottles of
premium mineral water.

546
00:25:43,004 --> 00:25:43,724
Sure thing.

547
00:25:46,964 --> 00:25:49,564
- Congratulations, Lin Xi.
- Congratulations, Lin Xi.

548
00:25:55,884 --> 00:25:58,164
I should thank you.

549
00:25:58,844 --> 00:26:01,084
I was alone when I first came here.

550
00:26:01,484 --> 00:26:03,884
But now I have five friends.

551
00:26:04,084 --> 00:26:05,524
According to
the six degrees of separation,

552
00:26:05,524 --> 00:26:06,204
one can know everyone

553
00:26:06,204 --> 00:26:07,004
in this world

554
00:26:07,004 --> 00:26:07,924
by just knowing six people

555
00:26:07,924 --> 00:26:09,484
to achieve something impossible.

556
00:26:10,004 --> 00:26:11,364
I feel that I possess the entire world

557
00:26:11,564 --> 00:26:12,804
after befriending you all.

558
00:26:13,804 --> 00:26:15,044
I should thank you too.

559
00:26:15,284 --> 00:26:16,164
Before you come,

560
00:26:16,444 --> 00:26:17,604
there was only
this silly Xie Ang beside me.

561
00:26:18,084 --> 00:26:19,684
But I have a group
of wonderful friends now.

562
00:26:20,524 --> 00:26:21,124
Thanks a bunch.

563
00:26:25,324 --> 00:26:26,804
What's your plan for this winter break?

564
00:26:28,084 --> 00:26:29,204
I will binge on drama and anime.

565
00:26:29,204 --> 00:26:30,564
Also, I want to spend time with my idol.

566
00:26:30,564 --> 00:26:31,324
I'm going on a trip.

567
00:26:31,324 --> 00:26:32,204
I'm going to Hainan.

568
00:26:33,124 --> 00:26:33,924
Lin Xi.

569
00:26:34,604 --> 00:26:35,204
What about you?

570
00:26:35,844 --> 00:26:36,484
I go home

571
00:26:36,804 --> 00:26:38,204
and watch the telly with my mom

572
00:26:38,204 --> 00:26:39,364
like a retired person.

573
00:26:39,644 --> 00:26:40,564
When are you leaving?

574
00:26:41,084 --> 00:26:41,724
Tomorrow.

575
00:26:42,004 --> 00:26:42,924
That is fast.

576
00:26:43,684 --> 00:26:45,244
Didn't you say
you were leaving next week?

577
00:26:45,924 --> 00:26:46,724
I don't want to leave so soon too.

578
00:26:47,084 --> 00:26:48,404
But my mum wanted me back earlier.

579
00:26:50,524 --> 00:26:52,364
I was thinking about
hanging out with you.

580
00:26:54,044 --> 00:26:55,324
It's just one month.

581
00:26:55,324 --> 00:26:56,164
This meal is on me.

582
00:26:56,164 --> 00:26:57,164
Let's take it as a farewell lunch
for me.

583
00:26:57,644 --> 00:26:58,884
No, I will pay for it.

584
00:26:59,644 --> 00:27:00,044
Well.

585
00:27:00,044 --> 00:27:01,324
Let's raise our drink

586
00:27:01,324 --> 00:27:02,164
for the coming winter break.

587
00:27:02,524 --> 00:27:03,004
Cheers.

588
00:27:03,004 --> 00:27:03,964
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

589
00:27:03,964 --> 00:27:04,804
Cheers.

590
00:27:05,404 --> 00:27:06,164
See you next semester.

591
00:27:24,724 --> 00:27:25,484
- I...
- I...

592
00:27:26,964 --> 00:27:27,764
You first.

593
00:27:28,684 --> 00:27:29,604
Nothing.

594
00:27:30,324 --> 00:27:31,644
It's just that I'm full

595
00:27:32,204 --> 00:27:33,164
and I don't feel like going home
so early.

596
00:27:33,164 --> 00:27:36,044
Let's take a walk.

597
00:27:37,364 --> 00:27:37,964
I wanted to say that too.

598
00:27:42,004 --> 00:27:42,924
Let me

599
00:27:43,444 --> 00:27:44,644
take you

600
00:27:44,644 --> 00:27:46,244
for the mysterious and fun sports.

601
00:27:46,964 --> 00:27:48,604
It helps with your digestion
and losing some weight.

602
00:27:49,364 --> 00:27:50,324
What's it?

603
00:27:51,044 --> 00:27:51,764
Follow me.

604
00:27:57,244 --> 00:27:58,844
Why do you come to the lakeside?

605
00:28:09,364 --> 00:28:09,964
Do you want to try it?

606
00:28:11,004 --> 00:28:11,964
I thought it would be something new.

607
00:28:11,964 --> 00:28:13,204
It turns out it's mere stone skipping.

608
00:28:13,204 --> 00:28:14,644
Mere stone skipping?

609
00:28:15,004 --> 00:28:15,844
Do you know that?

610
00:28:16,204 --> 00:28:17,564
Stone skipping is a sport

611
00:28:17,564 --> 00:28:19,004
that has been around
for thousands of years.

612
00:28:19,484 --> 00:28:21,084
According to historians' speculation,

613
00:28:21,284 --> 00:28:22,564
humans started this sport

614
00:28:22,564 --> 00:28:23,804
in the Stone Age.

615
00:28:24,324 --> 00:28:25,084
Seriously?

616
00:28:25,444 --> 00:28:26,084
Yes.

617
00:28:26,644 --> 00:28:27,844
Because only stones

618
00:28:28,484 --> 00:28:29,164
exist in the Stone Age.

619
00:28:30,724 --> 00:28:31,884
You are making this up.

620
00:28:32,644 --> 00:28:33,644
All I know about this

621
00:28:33,644 --> 00:28:34,044
is that my skills

622
00:28:34,044 --> 00:28:35,484
ruled over everyone
since I was in elementary school.

623
00:28:35,844 --> 00:28:38,004
I'm the skilled one in stone skipping.

624
00:28:38,284 --> 00:28:39,444
As if.

625
00:28:40,124 --> 00:28:41,364
I have never been defeated
by someone

626
00:28:41,364 --> 00:28:42,564
in the stone-skipping game.

627
00:28:44,204 --> 00:28:44,924
Let's compete.

628
00:28:45,684 --> 00:28:46,084
Sure thing.

629
00:28:46,444 --> 00:28:47,164
Pick your stones now.

630
00:29:00,924 --> 00:29:01,924
Three strikes in one go.

631
00:29:01,924 --> 00:29:03,044
Not bad.

632
00:29:03,804 --> 00:29:05,764
Let me feast your eyes
with five strikes.

633
00:29:12,084 --> 00:29:12,764
Is this your best record?

634
00:29:13,604 --> 00:29:14,404
Look carefully.

635
00:29:19,444 --> 00:29:21,004
Stone travels faraway.

636
00:29:21,004 --> 00:29:21,684
Do distant stones startle you?

637
00:29:23,004 --> 00:29:23,604
Fine.

638
00:29:24,204 --> 00:29:25,004
It seems I have to

639
00:29:25,004 --> 00:29:26,364
launch my last retort.

640
00:29:26,764 --> 00:29:28,244
Double stones skipping.

641
00:29:37,284 --> 00:29:39,244
I shall show you my best skill.

642
00:29:39,244 --> 00:29:39,844
Please.

643
00:29:40,124 --> 00:29:42,004
Double stones? I can do that too.

644
00:29:45,124 --> 00:29:46,684
Did you see that? It's glowing.

645
00:29:46,684 --> 00:29:47,244
Though it didn't skip far,

646
00:29:47,244 --> 00:29:47,924
it's glowing in the dark.

647
00:29:47,924 --> 00:29:49,084
Can you do that, huh?

648
00:29:52,713 --> 00:29:54,444
Are you sure the glowing thing
in the water

649
00:29:54,444 --> 00:29:55,724
is a stone

650
00:29:56,084 --> 00:29:56,924
instead of something else?

651
00:29:57,844 --> 00:29:58,764
For example,

652
00:29:59,484 --> 00:30:00,284
a handphone.

653
00:30:00,444 --> 00:30:01,524
Handphone?

654
00:30:06,884 --> 00:30:09,084
My phone.

655
00:30:09,484 --> 00:30:10,844
My phone.

656
00:30:11,644 --> 00:30:12,804
Why did I throw my phone?

657
00:30:13,124 --> 00:30:14,444
Put me down.

658
00:30:15,004 --> 00:30:16,164
Stop laughing.

659
00:30:16,164 --> 00:30:17,164
I am sorry for your loss.

660
00:30:17,164 --> 00:30:18,284
My phone is in the water.

661
00:30:18,284 --> 00:30:19,204
Impressive.

662
00:30:19,204 --> 00:30:20,244
Stop making fun of me.

663
00:30:20,244 --> 00:30:23,084
Go pick it up.

664
00:30:23,444 --> 00:30:24,804
Go pick it up.

665
00:30:25,764 --> 00:30:26,764
Don't go.

666
00:30:33,004 --> 00:30:34,084
Don't go.

667
00:30:35,924 --> 00:30:37,364
Give me back my shoe.

668
00:30:37,604 --> 00:30:39,564
Give me back my handphone and shoe.

669
00:30:50,964 --> 00:30:52,884
Stop laughing already.

670
00:30:53,044 --> 00:30:53,844
I'm sorry.

671
00:31:01,044 --> 00:31:02,244
You have lost your phone.

672
00:31:02,524 --> 00:31:03,284
What do you do then?

673
00:31:03,684 --> 00:31:05,884
The handphone is nearing its end anyway.

674
00:31:06,164 --> 00:31:06,884
It's good that I lost it now.

675
00:31:07,244 --> 00:31:09,204
Out with the old, in with the new.

676
00:31:14,724 --> 00:31:16,724
I can't reach you
during the winter break though.

677
00:31:23,204 --> 00:31:24,244
I mean

678
00:31:24,524 --> 00:31:25,764
what if I can't solve

679
00:31:25,764 --> 00:31:27,404
the homework?

680
00:31:28,484 --> 00:31:29,564
How could I solve it

681
00:31:29,564 --> 00:31:30,804
even when you can't?

682
00:31:30,964 --> 00:31:31,844
Who knows.

683
00:31:32,204 --> 00:31:33,764
Perhaps we can solve the problem

684
00:31:33,764 --> 00:31:35,044
together.

685
00:31:38,924 --> 00:31:40,044
I will call you.

686
00:31:45,644 --> 00:31:47,124
Do you remember my number?

687
00:31:47,564 --> 00:31:48,204
Yes.

688
00:31:57,884 --> 00:31:59,484
Perhaps you can repeat the number.
[*Sounds like hugging in Chinese]

689
00:32:29,684 --> 00:32:30,844
Do take good care of yourself

690
00:32:31,884 --> 00:32:33,404
after going back.

691
00:32:40,364 --> 00:32:41,444
Actually,

692
00:32:41,884 --> 00:32:43,124
I wanted to ask you

693
00:32:43,124 --> 00:32:45,164
to repeat my number.

694
00:32:54,124 --> 00:32:55,724
One three three eight four.

695
00:32:55,724 --> 00:32:57,564
May I take you
to the bus station tomorrow?

696
00:33:17,604 --> 00:33:18,484
Song Linxue.

697
00:33:20,724 --> 00:33:21,724
What brings you here?

698
00:33:25,804 --> 00:33:28,324
I want to talk to you.

699
00:33:28,924 --> 00:33:30,204
I will go upstairs first.

700
00:33:37,924 --> 00:33:39,164
Do you want to come in?

701
00:33:40,364 --> 00:33:40,844
No.

702
00:33:41,444 --> 00:33:42,764
I'm leaving soon.

703
00:33:51,604 --> 00:33:52,484
What has happened?

704
00:33:54,804 --> 00:33:56,804
I came here to apologize to you.

705
00:33:57,124 --> 00:33:59,324
I shouldn't have lied to you
on New Year's Day.

706
00:33:59,964 --> 00:34:01,444
It's fine.

707
00:34:06,324 --> 00:34:08,964
I have misunderstood the relationship

708
00:34:08,964 --> 00:34:09,724
between you two.

709
00:34:10,244 --> 00:34:11,444
But

710
00:34:11,964 --> 00:34:12,684
I know the reason

711
00:34:12,684 --> 00:34:14,004
why you are kind to her.

712
00:34:14,924 --> 00:34:16,044
I never expected

713
00:34:16,284 --> 00:34:18,924
the relationship between you
can be this complicated.

714
00:34:19,684 --> 00:34:20,764
What do you mean?

715
00:34:21,164 --> 00:34:22,404
My dad has told me.

716
00:34:22,684 --> 00:34:24,684
Her elder brother donated his heart
to your little brother.

717
00:34:31,964 --> 00:34:33,244
He doesn't know about me.

718
00:34:37,284 --> 00:34:38,404
But I know him.

719
00:34:39,124 --> 00:34:41,004
Why does a friendly person like you

720
00:34:41,204 --> 00:34:42,724
insist to befriend me?

721
00:34:42,884 --> 00:34:43,764
Because you're like my...

722
00:34:47,244 --> 00:34:48,004
One of my best friends.

723
00:34:48,444 --> 00:34:49,204
I feel familiar

724
00:34:49,204 --> 00:34:50,284
with you.

725
00:35:05,164 --> 00:35:07,524
This Pu'er tea is for your dad

726
00:35:07,804 --> 00:35:09,844
and this donkey-hide gelatin
is for your mum.

727
00:35:10,244 --> 00:35:12,564
I bought some snacks
and new year's gifts

728
00:35:12,564 --> 00:35:13,764
for you too.

729
00:35:13,764 --> 00:35:14,764
That's a lot, Madam Wen.

730
00:35:14,764 --> 00:35:15,484
There is no place

731
00:35:15,484 --> 00:35:16,644
for my socks already.

732
00:35:16,684 --> 00:35:18,244
Be careful when taking
the bus home tomorrow.

733
00:35:18,524 --> 00:35:19,124
Do remember

734
00:35:19,124 --> 00:35:20,764
to send my regards to your parents.

735
00:35:21,204 --> 00:35:21,964
Of course, I will.

736
00:35:25,764 --> 00:35:26,844
What time is it?

737
00:35:27,164 --> 00:35:28,804
Why hasn't that boy come back yet?

738
00:35:29,444 --> 00:35:30,964
I haven't thrown the rubbish.

739
00:35:31,404 --> 00:35:32,644
Madam Wen, I will throw it.

740
00:35:34,884 --> 00:35:35,724
Thank you.

741
00:35:36,084 --> 00:35:38,404
Actually, you are just repaying
the debt, right?

742
00:35:39,044 --> 00:35:40,324
Come to think of it,

743
00:35:40,924 --> 00:35:42,244
given your character,

744
00:35:42,604 --> 00:35:45,004
you wouldn't befriend someone like her.

745
00:35:49,524 --> 00:35:50,204
True.

746
00:35:51,284 --> 00:35:52,444
Given my character,

747
00:35:52,884 --> 00:35:54,124
I wouldn't befriend someone

748
00:35:54,124 --> 00:35:54,844
like her.

749
00:35:56,884 --> 00:35:57,964
To me,

750
00:35:58,564 --> 00:35:59,844
she's a crazy,

751
00:36:01,084 --> 00:36:02,804
clumsy and reckless person.

752
00:36:03,484 --> 00:36:03,884
She's able

753
00:36:03,884 --> 00:36:05,924
to mess up everything by herself.

754
00:36:06,964 --> 00:36:08,244
Ever since I met her,

755
00:36:09,004 --> 00:36:10,004
I've been having tough lucks.

756
00:36:11,124 --> 00:36:12,004
You are right.

757
00:36:13,004 --> 00:36:14,484
I don't like Lin Xi.

758
00:36:15,644 --> 00:36:16,724
I loathe her.

759
00:36:50,604 --> 00:36:51,884
Ever since I met her,

760
00:36:52,604 --> 00:36:53,684
I've been having tough lucks.

761
00:36:54,804 --> 00:36:55,644
You are right.

762
00:36:56,444 --> 00:36:57,844
I don't like Lin Xi.

763
00:37:13,644 --> 00:37:14,404
Lin Xi.

764
00:37:18,164 --> 00:37:19,044
Lin Xi.

765
00:37:32,484 --> 00:37:34,084
Where's Lin Xi, mum?

766
00:37:34,084 --> 00:37:34,564
She has left

767
00:37:34,564 --> 00:37:35,484
for the bus station.

768
00:37:35,484 --> 00:37:36,204
She has left?

769
00:37:36,604 --> 00:37:37,884
Didn't she wait for me?

770
00:37:38,164 --> 00:37:39,644
She asked me not to tell you though.

771
00:37:40,684 --> 00:37:41,804
Did you fight?

772
00:37:46,844 --> 00:37:47,724
Little brat.

773
00:37:50,364 --> 00:37:51,204
Hey, bro.

774
00:37:51,804 --> 00:37:52,564
Why are you here?

775
00:37:52,884 --> 00:37:54,004
I came to fetch Lin Xi.

776
00:37:54,004 --> 00:37:54,764
Where's she?

777
00:37:54,764 --> 00:37:55,244
She has left.

778
00:37:55,564 --> 00:37:56,404
She has left?

779
00:37:56,844 --> 00:37:58,324
Did you piss her off?

780
00:37:58,324 --> 00:38:00,084
She wouldn't leave
without leaving any messages.

781
00:38:03,124 --> 00:38:04,324
I'm talking to you.

782
00:38:04,804 --> 00:38:05,644
You're right.

783
00:38:06,404 --> 00:38:07,084
Lend me your scooter.

784
00:38:11,644 --> 00:38:12,324
Slow down.

785
00:39:03,884 --> 00:39:04,524
You are right.

786
00:39:05,124 --> 00:39:06,404
I don't like Lin Xi.

787
00:39:07,164 --> 00:39:08,164
I loathe her.

788
00:39:29,244 --> 00:39:30,844
What a stupid scooter.

789
00:39:31,804 --> 00:39:33,284
How could this happen now?

790
00:39:38,364 --> 00:39:39,244
