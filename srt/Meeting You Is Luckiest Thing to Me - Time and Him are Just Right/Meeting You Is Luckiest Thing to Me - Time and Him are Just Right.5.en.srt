(East Gate Hui Kao)

18
00:01:42,173 --> 00:01:43,853
Come, as our Class One turned
the corner

19
00:01:43,853 --> 00:01:44,493
and won second place,

20
00:01:44,493 --> 00:01:46,813
let's propose a toast.

21
00:01:52,213 --> 00:01:53,453
What a shame.

22
00:01:53,733 --> 00:01:55,013
It was so close.

23
00:01:55,213 --> 00:01:56,533
If we defeated Class 12,

24
00:01:56,533 --> 00:01:57,573
that would be amazing.

25
00:01:57,573 --> 00:01:59,533
Never mind, it's glorious even to fail.

26
00:01:59,893 --> 00:02:01,493
At least, the shot Lin Xi made
was really impressive.

27
00:02:01,653 --> 00:02:03,413
You're the best player to me.

28
00:02:05,133 --> 00:02:06,493
She just made one shot.

29
00:02:06,813 --> 00:02:08,133
That was not easy.

30
00:02:08,133 --> 00:02:09,333
It immediately turned the tide.

31
00:02:09,493 --> 00:02:10,733
It was a shame that Qin Kai

32
00:02:10,733 --> 00:02:11,613
still beat the buzzer in the end.

33
00:02:11,613 --> 00:02:12,173
Yes.

34
00:02:12,173 --> 00:02:13,293
I was just lucky.

35
00:02:13,573 --> 00:02:14,973
After all, they're from the Art Class.

36
00:02:15,173 --> 00:02:15,853
But,

37
00:02:15,853 --> 00:02:18,013
they were soaked
in the horrow sweat.

38
00:02:20,293 --> 00:02:20,773
Captain,

39
00:02:20,933 --> 00:02:21,933
I've got to propose a toast to you.

40
00:02:22,733 --> 00:02:23,573
You're being so courteous.

41
00:02:23,773 --> 00:02:25,453
Shall we order
another 50 lamb skewers

42
00:02:25,453 --> 00:02:26,453
as a token of appreciation?

43
00:02:26,453 --> 00:02:27,093
Sure.

44
00:02:27,893 --> 00:02:28,493
No problem.

45
00:02:28,653 --> 00:02:30,213
It's on me, just order
as much as you like.

46
00:02:30,213 --> 00:02:31,293
Okay.

47
00:02:31,293 --> 00:02:31,933
Boss,

48
00:02:32,933 --> 00:02:34,173
add on 50 lamb skewers.

49
00:02:34,173 --> 00:02:34,893
Okay.

50
00:02:34,893 --> 00:02:35,973
I want grilled eggplants,
grilled oysters,

51
00:02:35,973 --> 00:02:36,973
grilled brain, chicken gristle,

52
00:02:36,973 --> 00:02:38,173
chicken wings, chicken hearts
and all parts of it.

53
00:02:38,293 --> 00:02:39,453
That's too many.

54
00:02:39,773 --> 00:02:40,933
You heartless brat.

55
00:02:41,253 --> 00:02:42,773
Boss, and enoki mushrooms.

56
00:02:42,933 --> 00:02:43,493
Sure.

57
00:02:43,653 --> 00:02:44,933
Come, let's have another drink.

58
00:02:45,133 --> 00:02:46,773
Cheers!

60
00:02:49,853 --> 00:02:50,973
What's the point of just eating food?

61
00:02:50,973 --> 00:02:51,893
The ambience is great.

62
00:02:51,893 --> 00:02:53,293
Why don't we do something
other than this?

63
00:02:53,733 --> 00:02:54,373
Right.

64
00:02:54,733 --> 00:02:55,973
Wang Xizhi created "Lantingji Xu"

65
00:02:55,973 --> 00:02:57,333
when he was eating.

66
00:02:57,333 --> 00:02:58,213
Wang Bo created

67
00:02:58,213 --> 00:02:59,373
"A Tribute to King Teng's Tower"
during meal.

68
00:02:59,533 --> 00:03:02,133
We're not poetic people.

69
00:03:02,533 --> 00:03:04,453
Why don't we just recite poems
towards the moon?

70
00:03:04,653 --> 00:03:05,693
Recite poems
towards the moon?

71
00:03:06,533 --> 00:03:07,533
There's no moon here.

72
00:03:09,053 --> 00:03:10,173
There's no moon.

73
00:03:13,453 --> 00:03:15,973
When can I grasp the cup again?
The moon was with me last night.

74
00:03:16,253 --> 00:03:19,773
Beware of murderer at night,
beware of fire when the wind is strong.

75
00:03:22,013 --> 00:03:24,893
Raising my head, I see the moon,
it makes me think of my hometown.

76
00:03:24,893 --> 00:03:25,973
This has been said.

77

Here's your punishment.

84
00:03:44,573 --> 00:03:45,693
I don't want to play it anymore.

85
00:03:45,693 --> 00:03:46,693
I'm the only one who suffers.

86

You guys are the ones who enjoy it.

Let's play another game.

88
00:03:50,293 --> 00:03:52,533
Why don't we form a study group?

I'm serious.

00:03:56,573 --> 00:03:58,373
In ancient times,
Yu Boya and Zhong Ziqi met

91
00:03:58,373 --> 00:03:59,693
each other and became soulmates.

92
00:03:59,853 --> 00:04:01,773
As we hit it off,

93
00:04:01,933 --> 00:04:03,213
let's play basketball

94
00:04:03,453 --> 00:04:04,533
and study together.

95
00:04:04,613 --> 00:04:05,333
I agree.

96
00:04:05,733 --> 00:04:06,813
We should give it a name.

97
00:04:08,853 --> 00:04:11,493
Let's call it East Gate Squad.

No, this is too casual.

100
00:04:17,453 --> 00:04:18,653
There are many people in the class.

101
00:04:18,653 --> 00:04:20,133
For some reason, we formed
a basketball team.

102

Of all the food stalls,

103
00:04:21,293 --> 00:04:22,413
we chose this one.

104
00:04:22,693 --> 00:04:24,133
Some random reunion

105
00:04:24,133 --> 00:04:25,173
is predestined.

106
00:04:26,053 --> 00:04:26,573
Come.

107
00:04:26,733 --> 00:04:27,773
Let's do it in a ritualistic way.

108
00:04:29,973 --> 00:04:31,053
East Gate Squad is

109
00:04:31,093 --> 00:04:33,333
officially established.

Therefore,

114
00:04:52,653 --> 00:04:54,533
why must a social butterfly

115
00:04:54,733 --> 00:04:56,253
like you be friends with me?

116
00:04:56,413 --> 00:04:57,293
Because you're like

117
00:05:00,773 --> 00:05:01,693
a good buddy of mine.

118
00:05:02,853 --> 00:05:03,573
I feel

119
00:05:03,573 --> 00:05:04,613
a special warmth at seeing you.

120
00:05:06,613 --> 00:05:07,533
Am I a lot like him?

121
00:05:10,333 --> 00:05:13,493
Both of you don't like classes

122
00:05:13,933 --> 00:05:15,333
but you have good grades.

123
00:05:16,453 --> 00:05:17,493
You like playing basketball.

124
00:05:18,133 --> 00:05:19,333
Like Jordan and Kobe.

125
00:05:19,333 --> 00:05:20,853
You two are the shooting guards
in the team.

126

You look ferocious

127
00:05:25,333 --> 00:05:26,893
but you both are ladies' men.

128
00:05:29,173 --> 00:05:32,253
You look like a difficult person

129
00:05:32,893 --> 00:05:34,333
but in fact, you're the simple type.

130
00:05:36,173 --> 00:05:37,973
It's not that hard to make friends

131
00:05:39,533 --> 00:05:40,453
with you.

132
00:05:41,053 --> 00:05:41,733
Simple?

133
00:05:42,613 --> 00:05:44,533
This is the first time
someone says I'm a simple man.

134
00:05:50,493 --> 00:05:51,053
Wait.

135
00:05:52,413 --> 00:05:54,893
You've been ignoring me
the past few days.

136
00:05:56,293 --> 00:05:57,533
Were you tricking me?

137
00:06:02,093 --> 00:06:03,613
No doubt about it.

138
00:06:06,213 --> 00:06:07,213
Childish.

139
00:06:07,213 --> 00:06:08,373
You fell for it as well.

140
00:06:14,013 --> 00:06:15,093
What's with the rain?

141
00:06:16,573 --> 00:06:17,053
Let's go.

142
00:06:22,853 --> 00:06:24,333
It starts to pour rain all of a sudden.

do you have an umbrella?

146
00:06:31,653 --> 00:06:33,893
No, but I have an extra raincoat.

147
00:06:34,093 --> 00:06:34,933
Do you want it?

148
00:06:46,413 --> 00:06:47,533
It's slippery.

149
00:06:48,613 --> 00:06:50,093
You should hold me tight.

150
00:06:51,173 --> 00:06:52,053
If you fall off,

151
00:06:52,053 --> 00:06:53,413
I'll have to take you
to the hospital.

152
00:06:54,093 --> 00:06:56,173
I can sit tight in the backseat

00:07:48,173 --> 00:07:49,613
Are you out of your mind?

172
00:07:49,613 --> 00:07:51,013
I'm already home.

173
00:07:51,013 --> 00:07:51,893
Don't you think

174
00:07:51,893 --> 00:07:52,653
it's too late?

175
00:07:52,813 --> 00:07:54,053
I was going to bring it to you earlier.

176
00:07:54,293 --> 00:07:55,813
But you were too fast,
I couldn't catch up with you.

177
00:07:56,213 --> 00:07:57,133
Cut the nonsense.

178
00:07:57,293 --> 00:07:58,373
I don't believe you'd be this kind.

179
00:07:59,933 --> 00:08:01,813
We're in the same study group now.

180
00:08:02,173 --> 00:08:03,653
We're classmates and tablemates.

181
00:08:03,813 --> 00:08:05,253
We're getting closer now.

182
00:08:05,613 --> 00:08:06,853
I'm obligated to protect you.

183
00:08:06,853 --> 00:08:07,853
Don't you think, Dummy?

184
00:08:08,333 --> 00:08:09,293
You're the dumb one.

185
00:08:09,853 --> 00:08:11,333
I'm well aware of those cunning plots

186
00:08:11,333 --> 00:08:12,453
of yours.

187
00:08:13,133 --> 00:08:15,213
What do you want?
Money or homeworks?

188
00:08:15,853 --> 00:08:17,093
Can't you believe

189
00:08:17,373 --> 00:08:18,893
that I'm trying to take care of you?

190
00:08:20,413 --> 00:08:21,453
I don't buy it.

191
00:08:21,933 --> 00:08:22,853
Do the homeworks yourself.

192
00:08:23,053 --> 00:08:24,813
I don't have money,
don't try to get anything from me.

193
00:08:28,213 --> 00:08:28,893
See you tomorrow.

194
00:08:29,133 --> 00:08:31,133
What do you mean? It's weekend tomorrow.

195
00:08:32,453 --> 00:08:33,813
Well, see you on next Monday.

196
00:08:33,973 --> 00:08:35,253
As long as I can see you again.

197
00:08:42,333 --> 00:08:43,213
It's raining heavily.

198
00:08:58,813 --> 00:09:00,293
What's with the look?

199
00:09:00,293 --> 00:09:01,733
Do you think you're handsome?

200
00:09:02,413 --> 00:09:04,293
You're like a drowned rat.

201
00:09:04,773 --> 00:09:06,253
You're particularly like
my neighbor's dog

202
00:09:06,253 --> 00:09:07,813
when it falls into the water.

203
00:09:08,733 --> 00:09:09,733
Then, I'll show you

204
00:09:09,733 --> 00:09:11,053
a power attack.

205
00:09:28,213 --> 00:09:29,253
What kind of ginger tea is this?

206
00:09:29,253 --> 00:09:30,333
It smells like
traditional chinese medicine.

207
00:09:30,933 --> 00:09:32,093
That's right.

208
00:09:32,253 --> 00:09:33,533
This is my family's secret recipe,

209
00:09:33,533 --> 00:09:34,493
Isatis Tinctoria Ginger Soup.

210
00:09:35,973 --> 00:09:37,533
The combination
of Isatis Tinctoria and Ginger.

211
00:09:38,173 --> 00:09:39,293
Double kill.

212
00:09:43,053 --> 00:09:44,253
After finishing this bowl
of Ginger Soup,

213
00:09:44,933 --> 00:09:47,133
we're the true friends
who share hardships together.

214
00:09:55,693 --> 00:09:56,933
I don't want to share
hardships with you.

215
00:09:57,333 --> 00:09:58,373
I kind of like this.

216
00:10:01,013 --> 00:10:02,973
You have a strange taste.

217
00:10:04,213 --> 00:10:05,733
Is there any other strange hobby
that you have?

218
00:10:06,933 --> 00:10:08,453
I like being friends with lunatics.

219
00:10:10,213 --> 00:10:11,333
Whatever you say.

220
00:10:11,333 --> 00:10:12,173
I'm big-hearted.

221
00:10:14,853 --> 00:10:16,533
Do you have any other friends?

222
00:10:16,573 --> 00:10:17,293
Tell me about it.

223
00:10:19,733 --> 00:10:20,453
Knuth.

224
00:10:21,933 --> 00:10:22,693
Who is that?

225
00:10:23,373 --> 00:10:24,893
It's the God of Computer Programming.

226
00:10:25,973 --> 00:10:27,773
Also, I don't need friends.

227
00:10:28,053 --> 00:10:29,213
Don't bother.

228
00:10:35,213 --> 00:10:36,013
(Brother,)

229
00:10:36,213 --> 00:10:37,173
(Ji Junxing is)

230
00:10:37,173 --> 00:10:38,893
(really hard to get along with.)

231
00:10:38,933 --> 00:10:40,493
(No wonder he doesn't have friends.)

232
00:10:41,213 --> 00:10:41,813
(Therefore,)

233
00:10:41,813 --> 00:10:43,453
(I decide to reform him.)

234
00:10:51,453 --> 00:10:52,133
Good morning.

235
00:10:57,413 --> 00:10:58,053
Ji Junxing.

236
00:11:19,533 --> 00:11:20,613
Why are you here?

237
00:11:20,653 --> 00:11:22,533
To apply for the position
of the school festival's host.

238
00:11:23,093 --> 00:11:24,013
This is for you.

239
00:11:27,813 --> 00:11:28,893
Where did you buy this?

240
00:11:29,173 --> 00:11:30,613
I've been looking for it a long time.

241
00:11:31,373 --> 00:11:32,973
I performed abroad last week.

242
00:11:33,093 --> 00:11:34,653
After going to several shops,
I finally found it.

243
00:11:35,333 --> 00:11:36,133
Thank you.

244
00:11:36,133 --> 00:11:37,693
How much is it?
I'll wire the money to you.

245
00:11:39,373 --> 00:11:42,173
Can't you buy me a meal?

246
00:11:52,693 --> 00:11:53,293
What are you doing?

247
00:11:53,293 --> 00:11:55,173
Computer Programming.

248
00:11:56,133 --> 00:11:58,013
Computer Programming.

249
00:12:01,213 --> 00:12:03,013
I know who can be your friends.

250
00:12:03,493 --> 00:12:04,093
Who?

251
00:12:04,973 --> 00:12:05,813
The ballet girl

252
00:12:05,813 --> 00:12:06,973
who gave you this book.

253
00:12:08,613 --> 00:12:09,613
Song Linxue.

254
00:12:10,373 --> 00:12:11,213
Of course.

255
00:12:11,293 --> 00:12:12,293
She's busy.

256
00:12:12,293 --> 00:12:13,893
But she came all the way to our school

257
00:12:13,893 --> 00:12:15,013
just to give you this book.

258
00:12:15,093 --> 00:12:16,813
Obviously, it was to see you.

259
00:12:17,613 --> 00:12:18,653
You've thought too much.

260
00:12:18,813 --> 00:12:20,333
My dad used to be his dad's colleague.

261
00:12:20,333 --> 00:12:21,573
We're mere acquaintances.

262
00:12:21,573 --> 00:12:23,973
Besides, she was here to apply to become
the school festival's host.

263
00:12:24,493 --> 00:12:26,213
Then, you should apply
for the position of the male host.

264
00:12:27,813 --> 00:12:28,493
No way.

265
00:12:55,333 --> 00:12:56,973
Give me an application form
for the host position.

266
00:12:58,213 --> 00:12:59,693
Submit it to the broadcast room
after filling out.

267
00:12:59,813 --> 00:13:00,813
It's due at the end of the month.

268
00:13:02,413 --> 00:13:03,573
Jiang Yimian,

269
00:13:04,173 --> 00:13:06,013
you're a well-qualified literature
and art commissary

270
00:13:06,013 --> 00:13:07,373
of the student association.

271
00:13:08,533 --> 00:13:09,613
It's you.

272
00:13:10,533 --> 00:13:11,533
My hands are full

273
00:13:11,533 --> 00:13:13,213
because of the school festival.

274
00:13:13,453 --> 00:13:14,773
I don't have time to joke with you.

275
00:13:14,773 --> 00:13:16,133
I'm not joking with you.

276
00:13:16,293 --> 00:13:17,653
I'm really here to sign up for it.

277
00:13:17,973 --> 00:13:19,213
You want to be the host?

278
00:13:19,813 --> 00:13:20,693
Not me.

279
00:13:20,693 --> 00:13:21,373
It's Ji Junxing.

280
00:13:22,053 --> 00:13:23,253
You're going to sign up for him?

281
00:13:23,933 --> 00:13:25,693
The female host is Song Linxue,
isn't it?

282
00:13:26,493 --> 00:13:27,653
Most probably yes.

283
00:13:29,293 --> 00:13:30,253
That's good.

284
00:13:31,893 --> 00:13:32,653
In this way,

285
00:13:32,653 --> 00:13:34,533
they'll have the chance
to become friends.

286
00:13:35,013 --> 00:13:36,133
You... Wait.

287
00:13:36,373 --> 00:13:37,373
You've got to clear this up for me.

288
00:13:37,493 --> 00:13:38,213
What's going on?

289
00:13:40,493 --> 00:13:41,573
You're saying

290
00:13:41,773 --> 00:13:43,493
that your brother donated his heart
to Ji Junxing

291
00:13:43,493 --> 00:13:45,133
after he died from a car accident.

292
00:13:45,453 --> 00:13:47,573
Ji Junxing is kind of like your brother?

293
00:13:48,413 --> 00:13:49,813
Pretty much.

294
00:13:51,853 --> 00:13:53,493
Everything makes sense now.

295
00:13:53,853 --> 00:13:55,213
No wonder Ji Junxing was always absent

296
00:13:55,213 --> 00:13:56,573
when we were in ninth grade.

297
00:13:56,973 --> 00:13:58,693
It turned out he got a heart transplant

298
00:13:58,693 --> 00:13:59,853
without us knowing.

299
00:14:00,813 --> 00:14:02,933
Ji Junxing doesn't know about this.

300
00:14:03,173 --> 00:14:04,413
Why don't you tell him?

301
00:14:04,413 --> 00:14:06,413
If you told him about it,
not to mention being his friend,

302
00:14:06,413 --> 00:14:07,813
you would've been his sister.

303
00:14:08,053 --> 00:14:09,453
I'm sure he'll be grateful to you

304
00:14:09,453 --> 00:14:10,533
and do everything you say.

305
00:14:10,773 --> 00:14:11,973
It's unnecessary for you

306
00:14:11,973 --> 00:14:13,133
to pay so much effort.

307
00:14:13,133 --> 00:14:14,613
This would be moral coercion.

308
00:14:14,813 --> 00:14:16,093
I don't want him to feel burdened.

309
00:14:16,253 --> 00:14:17,613
I like it this way.

310
00:14:20,733 --> 00:14:21,293
Okay.

311
00:14:21,453 --> 00:14:22,653
I'll help you

312
00:14:22,653 --> 00:14:23,773
with the host thing.

313
00:14:25,053 --> 00:14:26,613
But will this work?

314
00:14:28,453 --> 00:14:29,533
It's not sufficient.

315
00:14:30,453 --> 00:14:32,213
To defeat the enemy,
we must know our enemy.

316
00:14:32,733 --> 00:14:33,853
I got to gather more information.

317
00:14:34,093 --> 00:14:34,693
Bye bye.

318
00:14:40,093 --> 00:14:40,853
Faster, faster!

319
00:14:42,253 --> 00:14:42,973
Lift your legs higher.

320
00:14:50,093 --> 00:14:51,413
That's all for today.

321
00:14:51,573 --> 00:14:53,213
Go home and relax your muscles.

322
00:14:53,693 --> 00:14:54,533
See you, Coach.

323
00:14:56,293 --> 00:14:58,133
The coach must be out of his mind today.

324
00:14:58,133 --> 00:14:59,013
I'm exhausted.

325
00:15:00,333 --> 00:15:01,453
All of you, stay up here.

326
00:15:01,613 --> 00:15:03,173
I'll take you
to Mongolian hotpot tonight.

327
00:15:03,173 --> 00:15:04,133
No, Kai.

328
00:15:04,413 --> 00:15:05,973
All of us are so tired today.

329
00:15:06,133 --> 00:15:07,413
Just spare us this time.

330
00:15:07,653 --> 00:15:08,893
Let's do it some other day.

331
00:15:09,093 --> 00:15:11,173
What's wrong?
All of you run out of energy?

332
00:15:11,173 --> 00:15:12,653
We can't do it anymore.

333
00:15:14,653 --> 00:15:15,453
Help me.

334
00:15:15,453 --> 00:15:16,533
Kai, I'm leaving.

335
00:15:16,933 --> 00:15:17,693
Goodbye, Kai.

336
00:15:17,773 --> 00:15:18,213
See you.

337
00:15:18,213 --> 00:15:18,973
Goodbye, Kai.

338
00:15:19,333 --> 00:15:20,173
Kai, we'll get going.

339
00:15:20,173 --> 00:15:20,813
Bye bye, see you, Kai.

340
00:15:21,133 --> 00:15:22,093
See you.

341
00:15:28,373 --> 00:15:29,093
Qin Kai.

342
00:15:32,293 --> 00:15:32,973
Why are you here?

343
00:15:34,453 --> 00:15:36,213
I need your help,
I'd like to ask about a person.

344
00:15:36,213 --> 00:15:36,933
Sure.

345
00:15:37,133 --> 00:15:37,653
But,

346
00:15:37,653 --> 00:15:39,173
you've got to do me a favor first.

347
00:15:39,413 --> 00:15:40,333
What favor?

348
00:15:40,773 --> 00:15:41,653
Have a meal with me.

349
00:15:45,173 --> 00:15:46,653
I told you I'll get us something to eat.

350
00:15:47,013 --> 00:15:48,133
What is the milk tea for?

351
00:15:49,493 --> 00:15:50,893
I've got something to ask you.

352
00:15:50,893 --> 00:15:52,133
I'm afraid it'd be too much noise
at the restaurant.

353
00:15:52,693 --> 00:15:54,453
Well, let me ask you this.

354
00:15:54,853 --> 00:15:56,493
Are you close to Song Linxue?

355
00:15:57,053 --> 00:15:58,053
Song Linxue?

356
00:15:58,413 --> 00:15:59,613
She's ice cold.

357
00:16:01,413 --> 00:16:02,773
Isn't your tablemate ice cold too?

358
00:16:02,773 --> 00:16:04,253
They should meet each other.

359
00:16:04,573 --> 00:16:05,253
I agree.

360
00:16:06,013 --> 00:16:07,013
Do you know anything other than that?

361
00:16:07,373 --> 00:16:09,613
Like Song Linxue's hobby.

362
00:16:09,613 --> 00:16:10,293
What clothes

363
00:16:10,293 --> 00:16:11,733
does she usually like to wear?

364
00:16:11,973 --> 00:16:13,133
Does she eat spicy food?

365
00:16:13,133 --> 00:16:14,653
(I've wired the monthly expenses to you.)
How sweet would she like her milk tea?

366
00:16:14,893 --> 00:16:16,373
And when she sleeps...

367
00:16:20,173 --> 00:16:21,013
What's wrong?

368
00:16:21,893 --> 00:16:22,493
Nothing.

369
00:16:22,660 --> 00:16:22,893
(ICBC bank revenue RMB 10000)

370
00:16:22,893 --> 00:16:24,493
I knew someone will wire
money to me today.

371
00:16:25,133 --> 00:16:26,693
That's why I want to buy you a meal.

372
00:16:28,453 --> 00:16:29,613
You want to buy me a meal

373
00:16:29,613 --> 00:16:30,893
because someone wires money to you?

374
00:16:34,613 --> 00:16:36,293
No, today is my birthday.

375
00:16:39,493 --> 00:16:40,573
Why don't you tell me that earlier?

376
00:17:01,333 --> 00:17:02,453
Qin Kai.

377
00:17:17,133 --> 00:17:20,893
Happy Birthday to you.

378
00:17:21,453 --> 00:17:25,213
Happy Birthday to you.

379
00:17:26,013 --> 00:17:30,293
Happy Birthday to you.

380
00:17:30,813 --> 00:17:35,053
Happy Birthday to you.

381
00:17:35,813 --> 00:17:36,853
Happy Birthday.

382
00:17:41,053 --> 00:17:41,973
You went so far

383
00:17:42,453 --> 00:17:43,853
just to buy me a birthday cake?

384
00:17:44,293 --> 00:17:44,853
Yes.

385
00:17:45,093 --> 00:17:46,773
A cake, a candle and birthday song.

386
00:17:46,773 --> 00:17:48,093
I've got you a three-piece birthday set.

387
00:17:52,733 --> 00:17:53,813
It's just a birthday.

388
00:17:54,133 --> 00:17:55,133
It's needless
to go through all the fuss.

389
00:17:55,493 --> 00:17:56,413
It won't do.

390
00:17:56,813 --> 00:17:58,413
You've had birthday in the past

391
00:17:58,413 --> 00:17:59,493
and you'll have it in future.

392
00:17:59,693 --> 00:18:01,453
But at this moment,

393
00:18:01,453 --> 00:18:03,013
this birthday is once in a lifetime.

394
00:18:04,533 --> 00:18:05,253
Blow it out.

395
00:18:09,133 --> 00:18:10,213
Have you made a wish?

396
00:18:10,373 --> 00:18:11,133
I do.

397
00:18:11,733 --> 00:18:13,413
I wish I could spend
my birthday with you

398
00:18:13,413 --> 00:18:14,573
each year thereafter.

399
00:18:15,013 --> 00:18:15,933
You're crazy.

400
00:18:15,933 --> 00:18:17,133
This is to say to the God.

401
00:18:17,133 --> 00:18:18,373
It won't come true if you say it out.

402
00:18:18,933 --> 00:18:21,413
I've tried it, it didn't come true.

403
00:18:21,573 --> 00:18:22,493
I might as well tell you this.

404
00:18:22,493 --> 00:18:23,853
The odds of fulfilling it
will be better.

405
00:18:23,853 --> 00:18:24,533
Don't you think?

406
00:18:26,413 --> 00:18:28,933
Okay, then. I'll celebrate
your birthday with you next year.

407
00:18:29,333 --> 00:18:30,773
I'll buy you a dozen of candles.

408
00:18:30,773 --> 00:18:32,653
And sing you different versions
of birthday songs.

409
00:18:32,653 --> 00:18:35,173
Happy Birthday to you.

410
00:18:35,173 --> 00:18:36,533
Save it, there are many people here.

411
00:18:36,533 --> 00:18:37,733
I'm not a kid anymore.

412
00:18:39,293 --> 00:18:40,053
Well, then.

413
00:18:43,813 --> 00:18:44,413
Qin Kai,

414
00:18:46,453 --> 00:18:48,293
I wish you happiness

415
00:18:48,293 --> 00:18:49,533
every day going forward.

416
00:18:50,213 --> 00:18:51,573
Happy 17th Birthday.

417
00:18:58,893 --> 00:19:00,293
Happy 17th Birthday.

418
00:19:06,093 --> 00:19:07,413
You must help me

419
00:19:07,413 --> 00:19:08,533
with the thing I ask you.

420
00:19:08,533 --> 00:19:10,733
Or I'll publish the video

421
00:19:10,733 --> 00:19:13,253
about you crying miserably that day.

422
00:19:13,253 --> 00:19:15,453
Don't do it, when did I cry?

423
00:19:15,453 --> 00:19:17,293
I saw it, I secretly taped it that time.

424
00:19:17,293 --> 00:19:18,613
I asked Black Bull to send it to me.

425
00:19:18,613 --> 00:19:20,333
How could Black Bull send that to you?

426
00:19:20,333 --> 00:19:21,653
What else do you think? He's your buddy.

427
00:19:21,653 --> 00:19:22,733
Don't you know him?

428
00:19:23,013 --> 00:19:25,013
He betrayed me.

429
00:19:26,773 --> 00:19:29,053
There are many things you don't know.

430
00:19:48,133 --> 00:19:49,333
Why are you sitting here

431
00:19:49,333 --> 00:19:50,613
all alone in the dark?

432
00:19:50,613 --> 00:19:52,013
It's late. Where have you been?

433
00:19:53,213 --> 00:19:55,013
Of course I went
to seek happiness for you.

434
00:19:55,973 --> 00:19:58,013
I won't feel happy being with Qin Kai.

435
00:19:59,213 --> 00:20:00,173
You saw us?

436
00:20:00,733 --> 00:20:02,253
Then, I don't have to keep it from you.

437
00:20:02,733 --> 00:20:04,013
I've got the first-hand information

438
00:20:04,013 --> 00:20:05,693
about Song Linxue from Qin Kai.

439
00:20:08,493 --> 00:20:10,813
Song Linxue is
a very disciplined person.

440
00:20:11,173 --> 00:20:13,693
She looks like a swan
and she eats like a swan.

441
00:20:13,693 --> 00:20:15,533
She only eats two pieces
of leaves in a meal.

442
00:20:16,053 --> 00:20:17,413
She's either competing

443
00:20:17,413 --> 00:20:18,373
or on her way

444
00:20:18,373 --> 00:20:19,693
to the competition in all years.

445
00:20:20,693 --> 00:20:23,213
But if you want to have
a chance meeting with her,

446
00:20:23,213 --> 00:20:24,893
you can try it at Binjiang Avenue.

447
00:20:25,133 --> 00:20:26,693
Because she'll go there
for a morning jog.

448
00:20:27,253 --> 00:20:29,413
Also, she particularly likes
to eat sweets.

449
00:20:29,653 --> 00:20:31,333
Most people don't know
about this secret.

450
00:20:32,493 --> 00:20:34,253
I'm not interested in her.

451
00:20:36,733 --> 00:20:37,653
No.

452
00:20:37,653 --> 00:20:39,493
There's one thing
you must be interested in.

453
00:20:41,053 --> 00:20:41,973
I've signed you up

454
00:20:41,973 --> 00:20:43,413
for the position
of the school anniversary's host.

455
00:20:51,900 --> 00:20:54,260
(Shortlist for the Host
of Chunhui High School 75th Anniversary)

456
00:20:58,493 --> 00:21:00,293
Are you out of your mind?
Why did you sign me up?

457
00:21:00,853 --> 00:21:02,893
Are you out of your mind?
Why did you sign me up?

458
00:21:03,813 --> 00:21:04,573
No.

459
00:21:05,013 --> 00:21:06,733
I just want to see how high

460
00:21:06,733 --> 00:21:08,773
the approval rating
of our combination is.

461
00:21:11,733 --> 00:21:12,893
What are you waiting for?

462
00:21:13,933 --> 00:21:14,813
Go in for the meeting.

463
00:21:15,693 --> 00:21:17,573
What's going on? There's even a meeting?

464
00:21:17,973 --> 00:21:19,653
That's what I want to ask you.

465
00:21:19,893 --> 00:21:21,013
Why did you sign up for it?

466
00:21:21,973 --> 00:21:23,013
There are several pairs

467
00:21:23,013 --> 00:21:23,733
of applicants.

468
00:21:23,733 --> 00:21:25,013
Mr. Xie attaches great importance to it.

469
00:21:25,013 --> 00:21:26,173
There will be a public selection.

470
00:21:26,573 --> 00:21:28,093
This meeting is to inform you guys

471
00:21:28,093 --> 00:21:28,853
that you have to shoot

472
00:21:28,853 --> 00:21:29,813
a video with your partner.

473
00:21:29,813 --> 00:21:30,853
It'll be uploaded to the school website.

474
00:21:30,853 --> 00:21:32,173
The pair with the highest number
of votes will be selected.

475
00:21:32,293 --> 00:21:32,973
What?

476
00:21:33,333 --> 00:21:34,773
We even have to make a video?

477
00:21:35,733 --> 00:21:36,853
I'm going to quit.

478
00:21:37,173 --> 00:21:39,093
You don't have to, I'll quit.

479
00:21:40,293 --> 00:21:42,333
Both of you, don't quit,
I'll quit, okay?

480
00:21:42,613 --> 00:21:44,173
I'll quit if you do.

481
00:21:55,413 --> 00:21:56,933
You sign up for the position too?

482
00:21:57,213 --> 00:21:58,213
Surprise.

483
00:22:00,213 --> 00:22:01,413
Who's your partner?

484
00:22:02,373 --> 00:22:02,933
You.

485
00:22:03,733 --> 00:22:04,733
You should've told me earlier.

486
00:22:04,733 --> 00:22:06,293
I'm going to compete abroad tomorrow.

487
00:22:08,893 --> 00:22:10,813
I'll leave the task
of writing script to you.

488
00:22:16,813 --> 00:22:18,533
I''ve got a contest in a couple of days.

489
00:22:19,013 --> 00:22:19,693
Really?

490
00:22:21,653 --> 00:22:23,373
Wonderful, don't come back after that.

491
00:22:23,573 --> 00:22:24,853
Come back when the school festival ends.

492
00:22:34,653 --> 00:22:36,333
Why don't you practise with Qin Kai?

493
00:22:36,933 --> 00:22:38,293
By consensus,

494
00:22:38,293 --> 00:22:40,133
we decide to abstain
and give way to you guys.

495
00:22:40,133 --> 00:22:40,813
We're not going to practise.

496
00:22:41,533 --> 00:22:43,213
What a coincidence, so are we.

497
00:22:44,573 --> 00:22:45,133
When is Song Linxue

498
00:22:45,133 --> 00:22:46,253
going to come back?

499
00:22:46,613 --> 00:22:47,573
On the same day with the party.

500
00:22:48,133 --> 00:22:49,253
What about the rehearsal?

501
00:22:49,653 --> 00:22:50,733
She doesn't need it.

502
00:22:50,933 --> 00:22:52,573
But you do.

503
00:22:52,573 --> 00:22:54,013
You stumble over words.

504
00:22:54,173 --> 00:22:55,293
It'll waste others' times

505
00:22:55,293 --> 00:22:56,533
and give a bad impression.

506
00:22:58,333 --> 00:22:59,333
She's not here.

507
00:22:59,333 --> 00:23:00,293
What can I do?

508
00:23:03,453 --> 00:23:05,253
Never mind, due to the tight schedule
and heavy task,

509
00:23:05,413 --> 00:23:06,773
I'll run lines with you.

510
00:23:08,053 --> 00:23:08,693
I'll help you.

511
00:23:09,293 --> 00:23:10,013
How?

512
00:23:11,453 --> 00:23:13,533
Gently, I'm here.

513
00:23:14,013 --> 00:23:16,493
With dreams and hopes,

514
00:23:16,773 --> 00:23:18,533
with the will of exploring the future,

515
00:23:19,013 --> 00:23:20,093
Chunhui,

516
00:23:20,253 --> 00:23:21,813
you're the cradle of my dream.

517
00:23:22,093 --> 00:23:23,653
You're my power to forge ahead.

518
00:23:25,733 --> 00:23:28,333
Gently, I'm here.

519
00:23:28,973 --> 00:23:30,653
With my love for you,

520
00:23:31,213 --> 00:23:33,333
ah, Chunhui High School,

521
00:23:33,573 --> 00:23:34,933
she advocates struggle

522
00:23:34,933 --> 00:23:35,853
and refuses mediocrity.

523
00:23:35,853 --> 00:23:37,453
She encourages us to fight fearlessly

524
00:23:37,453 --> 00:23:39,653
with the spirit of exploration.

525
00:23:39,653 --> 00:23:41,093
With her pure school motto,

526
00:23:41,093 --> 00:23:43,573
meticulous teaching style
and relentless style of study...

527
00:23:44,813 --> 00:23:45,813
It's six

528
00:23:45,813 --> 00:23:47,253
in the morning on Saturday.

529
00:23:47,653 --> 00:23:48,413
Can you postpone

530
00:23:48,413 --> 00:23:49,613
your love for Chunhui?

531
00:23:52,453 --> 00:23:54,213
It's already six, how can you sleep now?

532
00:23:54,813 --> 00:23:56,333
Are you going to improvise on the party?

533
00:23:59,653 --> 00:24:01,093
My improvisation is way better

534
00:24:01,093 --> 00:24:02,533
than your ridiculous script.

535
00:24:04,013 --> 00:24:04,773
It's not good?

536
00:24:05,253 --> 00:24:06,493
It took me a long time to write it.

537
00:24:09,813 --> 00:24:11,373
I'll go run lines with Qin Kai first.

538
00:24:12,253 --> 00:24:12,813
Wait.

539
00:24:14,053 --> 00:24:14,653
Who?

540
00:24:15,453 --> 00:24:16,213
Qin Kai.

541
00:24:16,613 --> 00:24:17,653
Why do you go to him?

542
00:24:17,733 --> 00:24:19,213
Are those lines for sport contest?

543
00:24:22,093 --> 00:24:23,573
You're right.

544
00:24:49,013 --> 00:24:51,013
I've read the script all afternoon.

545
00:24:52,013 --> 00:24:53,293
I don't have any inspirations.

546
00:24:57,253 --> 00:24:58,773
Shouldn't you contribute something

547
00:24:58,773 --> 00:25:00,173
with the precious brain cells of yours?

548
00:25:02,853 --> 00:25:03,533
Sure.

549
00:25:05,253 --> 00:25:06,373
It's star-studded here.

550
00:25:06,373 --> 00:25:07,773
We're delighted.

551
00:25:07,773 --> 00:25:09,093
It's filled with people of virtue.

552
00:25:09,253 --> 00:25:10,293
As we're gathered here,

553
00:25:10,533 --> 00:25:11,773
let us sing and dance

554
00:25:11,773 --> 00:25:13,693
to warmly celebrate the 75th birthday

555
00:25:13,693 --> 00:25:15,213
of Chunhui High School

556
00:25:15,213 --> 00:25:17,093
with a beating and sincere heart.

557
00:25:17,453 --> 00:25:20,453
And say, Alma Mater, Happy Birthday!

558
00:25:21,173 --> 00:25:22,213
You're a good talker.

559
00:25:22,933 --> 00:25:24,893
Say it again, I'll jot it down.

560
00:25:25,253 --> 00:25:27,213
There's a lot of uninspired speeches

561
00:25:27,213 --> 00:25:28,413
like this on the website.

562
00:25:29,093 --> 00:25:29,813
It's no fun.

563
00:25:31,693 --> 00:25:32,973
You toy with me again.

564
00:25:35,253 --> 00:25:36,453
What do you find interesting?

565
00:25:42,933 --> 00:25:43,653
Programming.

566
00:25:45,213 --> 00:25:46,493
One's sense of achievement

567
00:25:46,493 --> 00:25:48,053
mainly comes from two matters.

568
00:25:48,893 --> 00:25:50,933
Creation and destruction.

569
00:25:51,693 --> 00:25:52,933
Programming belongs to the first one.

570
00:25:54,813 --> 00:25:57,613
It feels like creating

571
00:25:58,533 --> 00:26:00,213
all things like God does.

572
00:26:01,093 --> 00:26:04,013
The people, streets, finance,

573
00:26:04,733 --> 00:26:06,333
including the entire cosmos.

574
00:26:07,093 --> 00:26:08,293
Everything you think and see

575
00:26:08,613 --> 00:26:09,733
can be realized.

576
00:26:12,133 --> 00:26:13,613
Just like the book in my hand.

577
00:26:14,453 --> 00:26:16,293
A good code is clean and neat.

578
00:26:16,933 --> 00:26:18,613
As romantic as a piece of artwork.

579
00:26:19,813 --> 00:26:23,333
It's a shame that there are
many people who can't see it.

580
00:26:57,093 --> 00:26:59,093
(What about a good script?)

581
00:26:59,493 --> 00:27:01,413
(Talk human, tell the truth.)

582
00:27:01,573 --> 00:27:03,613
(Listen to the sound of your heart.)

583
00:27:05,413 --> 00:27:07,613
The sound of my heart?

584
00:27:11,413 --> 00:27:13,853
(Chunhui turns 75 today.)

585
00:27:14,333 --> 00:27:17,053
(It's the youth
for generation after generation.)

586
00:27:17,413 --> 00:27:19,853
(It's also the youth for me and you.)

587
00:27:20,373 --> 00:27:22,573
We met and knew each other here.

588
00:27:22,573 --> 00:27:23,933
Becoming schoolmates and friends.

589
00:27:24,213 --> 00:27:25,733
One day, we'll depart

590
00:27:25,733 --> 00:27:27,053
with our dreams from here.

591
00:27:27,053 --> 00:27:29,813
To every corners of the world.

592
00:27:29,813 --> 00:27:31,893
We're no longer the tablemates
we see everyday

593
00:27:31,893 --> 00:27:33,333
and the partners we fight along with.

594
00:27:33,333 --> 00:27:34,453
But we must always remember

595
00:27:34,453 --> 00:27:36,253
these shimmering days.

596
00:27:36,813 --> 00:27:37,373
How is it?

597
00:27:37,613 --> 00:27:38,893
I thought of you

598
00:27:38,893 --> 00:27:40,573
and East Gate Squad when I wrote this.

599
00:27:41,133 --> 00:27:41,893
It's nothing special.

600
00:27:41,893 --> 00:27:43,333
It sounds like
an elementary school essay.

601
00:27:43,693 --> 00:27:45,173
That's why it's real.

602
00:27:45,453 --> 00:27:47,213
As a reminder, it'll be late
if you don't make the video now.

603
00:27:47,733 --> 00:27:49,693
We've finished recording it
with the webcam yesterday.

604
00:27:51,093 --> 00:27:51,933
Why didn't you tell me?

605
00:27:52,133 --> 00:27:53,373
I spent a night writing this.

606
00:27:54,253 --> 00:27:55,133
I can tell it.

607
00:27:55,133 --> 00:27:56,853
That's why you were
30 minutes late today.

608
00:27:59,373 --> 00:28:00,013
Get on.

609
00:28:01,933 --> 00:28:03,573
I don't have to take the bus?

610
00:28:04,253 --> 00:28:05,733
Don't we have to go separately?

611
00:28:06,173 --> 00:28:07,173
What if they found out?

612
00:28:07,173 --> 00:28:07,893
I'll get going, then.

613
00:28:08,773 --> 00:28:10,053
Wait, I'll get on the bicycle.

614
00:28:10,053 --> 00:28:11,333
I... I'll do it.

615
00:28:12,653 --> 00:28:13,173
Go!

616
00:28:19,853 --> 00:28:21,653
So this is what it feels like
to sit on the backseat.

617
00:28:22,453 --> 00:28:23,213
What else do you think?

618
00:28:23,213 --> 00:28:23,933
Go!

619
00:28:31,813 --> 00:28:32,333
Hey,

620
00:28:32,453 --> 00:28:34,053
when you two stand on the stage,

621
00:28:34,253 --> 00:28:35,933
it's like the sovereign descends
the world.

622
00:28:36,333 --> 00:28:37,053
What is that?

623
00:28:37,293 --> 00:28:38,493
What kind of nonsense

624
00:28:38,533 --> 00:28:39,733
is that?

625
00:28:39,893 --> 00:28:40,853
You, Ji Junxing

626
00:28:40,853 --> 00:28:41,693
and Song Linxue,

627
00:28:41,693 --> 00:28:42,253
Junlin couple,

628
00:28:42,253 --> 00:28:42,973
it's a perfect match.

629
00:28:42,973 --> 00:28:44,373
It's like a match made by heaven.

630
00:28:44,373 --> 00:28:45,333
Who gave us that name?

631
00:28:45,413 --> 00:28:46,853
Me, I've done a great job, don't I?

632
00:28:50,093 --> 00:28:51,453
What kind of riding skill is this?

633
00:28:51,453 --> 00:28:52,733
I might as well take the bus.

634
00:28:53,373 --> 00:28:54,413
Have you ever thought of this?

635
00:28:54,893 --> 00:28:56,773
If you and Qin Kai got the place,

636
00:28:57,853 --> 00:28:59,973
I heard that you two are quite popular.

637
00:29:02,013 --> 00:29:02,853
It's impossible.

638
00:29:13,333 --> 00:29:13,973
Lin Xi.

639
00:29:14,893 --> 00:29:15,693
Something happens.

640
00:29:15,693 --> 00:29:16,333
What's the matter?

641
00:29:17,093 --> 00:29:18,813
Your Junlin couple is screwed.

642
00:29:18,813 --> 00:29:20,013
How did you get so many votes?

643
00:29:20,933 --> 00:29:22,253
Qin Kai and I?

644
00:29:22,573 --> 00:29:24,173
Since the moment you uploaded the video,

645
00:29:24,293 --> 00:29:25,333
within one night,

646
00:29:25,333 --> 00:29:27,173
the vote excels
and it's far ahead of them.

647
00:29:27,173 --> 00:29:28,333
You guys crush it.

648
00:29:28,493 --> 00:29:29,813
Are you kidding me?

649
00:29:31,413 --> 00:29:32,733
Qin Kai and I didn't even lift
our heads.

650
00:29:32,733 --> 00:29:34,293
Like the emotionless reading machines.

651
00:29:35,533 --> 00:29:36,213
See for yourself.

652
00:29:37,573 --> 00:29:39,013
It's not yet the cut-off time.

653
00:29:39,013 --> 00:29:39,293
(Selection of the Host
of Chunhui High School 75th Anniversary)

654
00:29:39,293 --> 00:29:40,413
But you already got 3000 votes.

655
00:29:41,013 --> 00:29:42,333
How is that possible?

656
00:29:43,893 --> 00:29:45,293
How many people are there in our school?

657
00:29:45,813 --> 00:29:48,133
About 2,200.

658
00:30:00,013 --> 00:30:00,613
Sorry.

659
00:30:01,133 --> 00:30:01,813
Don't.

660
00:30:02,293 --> 00:30:03,213
I'm still alive.

661
00:30:04,053 --> 00:30:04,893
What's going on?

662
00:30:05,173 --> 00:30:05,933
You ask him.

663
00:30:08,413 --> 00:30:09,373
It's my fault.

664
00:30:10,573 --> 00:30:11,693
I've done you wrong.

665
00:30:13,973 --> 00:30:18,213
Three, two, one, go!

666
00:30:19,173 --> 00:30:20,093
Keep it down.

I didn't want you two to lose badly.

683

I didn't expect you guys
to be so popular.

684
00:30:55,413 --> 00:30:56,613
We accidentally clicked too many times.

685
00:31:01,093 --> 00:31:03,693
Why don't you give it a try?

686
00:31:04,013 --> 00:31:05,413
Why don't you kill yourself to atone?

687

Why don't we turn ourselves in?

688

Very well.

689
00:31:12,573 --> 00:31:15,173
You've learned to hire supporters
at such an early age.

690
00:31:16,013 --> 00:31:16,933
We're keenly aware

691
00:31:16,933 --> 00:31:18,413
of our mistakes so we're here

to turn ourselves in.

It's a must.

695
00:31:24,573 --> 00:31:25,773
And write an apology.

696
00:31:26,013 --> 00:31:28,813
Will do, we must do it,
or we'll feel sorry for Chunhui.

697
00:31:28,813 --> 00:31:30,693
Or we'll feel sorry for the alumni.

I can give you choices.

Support services or write an apology,
choose either one.

702

- Support services.

we've got to get ready for it.

I'm worried you'll feel thirsty
so I bought you water.
