17
00:02:03,100 --> 00:02:03,940
Are you looking for Lin Xi?

18
00:02:04,140 --> 00:02:05,020
She left for school.

19
00:02:05,700 --> 00:02:06,300
She left?

20
00:02:06,300 --> 00:02:06,740
Yes.

21
00:02:07,180 --> 00:02:09,340
She said that she had to
go to school early these few days.

22
00:02:09,540 --> 00:02:11,220
She couldn't have breakfast with us too.

23
00:02:11,540 --> 00:02:13,180
Look. I even bought three servings.

24
00:02:13,260 --> 00:02:14,940
It's all right. I can take two servings.

25
00:02:16,740 --> 00:02:17,300
Come here.

26
00:02:25,940 --> 00:02:27,060
You have quite a good appetite.

27
00:02:27,340 --> 00:02:29,340
I didn't know
you liked steamed buns so much.

28
00:02:29,620 --> 00:02:30,180
Mom.

29
00:02:30,340 --> 00:02:32,300
This is the taste of freedom.

30
00:02:36,980 --> 00:02:38,340
What's going on between
you and Ji Junxing?

31
00:02:38,740 --> 00:02:40,260
I was sitting in the front row,

32
00:02:40,260 --> 00:02:41,460
but I could feel

33
00:02:41,460 --> 00:02:42,900
the awkwardness in the air.

34
00:02:44,060 --> 00:02:45,060
That's right.

35
00:02:45,420 --> 00:02:46,380
I need to stop talking to him
for a few days

36
00:02:46,380 --> 00:02:47,820
and give him a taste of loss.

37
00:02:48,460 --> 00:02:49,660
Don't you want to be his friend anymore?

38
00:02:50,100 --> 00:02:50,820
I want.

39
00:02:51,180 --> 00:02:52,420
Then, why are you not talking to him?

40
00:02:52,620 --> 00:02:54,100
It seems like
you're losing more than he is.

41
00:02:55,420 --> 00:02:57,340
Our relationship has hit rock bottom.

42
00:02:57,340 --> 00:02:58,620
I have nothing to lose.

43
00:02:59,100 --> 00:03:00,740
If the results are what matter the most,

44
00:03:00,860 --> 00:03:01,900
all I want is to be his friend.

45
00:03:01,900 --> 00:03:03,020
I can't be acting servilely
the whole time.

46
00:03:03,340 --> 00:03:05,660
So I've decided to lift my chin up
and stick my chest out

47
00:03:05,660 --> 00:03:06,660
as I march on this path of friendship.

48
00:03:07,620 --> 00:03:08,140
Nice.

49
00:03:08,340 --> 00:03:09,620
I like how domineering you are.

50
00:03:10,940 --> 00:03:11,740
But

51
00:03:12,820 --> 00:03:13,660
what's your plan?

52
00:03:14,860 --> 00:03:15,900
Have you ever heard

53
00:03:15,900 --> 00:03:17,620
of the story about a fox
that's chasing a rabbit?

54
00:03:18,220 --> 00:03:18,900
I haven't.

55
00:03:19,660 --> 00:03:21,620
If the fox keeps on chasing,
and the rabbit keeps on running,

56
00:03:21,620 --> 00:03:22,940
then it'll never catch the rabbit.

57
00:03:23,180 --> 00:03:25,220
So after a few days of chasing,

58
00:03:25,580 --> 00:03:26,460
the fox will disappear.

59
00:03:26,580 --> 00:03:27,660
When the rabbit lets its guard down,

60
00:03:27,660 --> 00:03:29,300
the fox will catch it by surprise
and take it down.

61
00:03:30,060 --> 00:03:30,620
Wait a minute.

62
00:03:31,060 --> 00:03:31,900
Who's the rabbit?

63
00:03:32,020 --> 00:03:32,740
Ji Junxing.

64
00:03:33,900 --> 00:03:35,580
Are you saying that he's the rabbit

65
00:03:36,060 --> 00:03:38,460
and you're the fox
that's trying to catch him?

66
00:03:40,540 --> 00:03:42,580
Do you really think
you're capable of catching him?

67
00:03:43,260 --> 00:03:44,380
Just wait and see.

68
00:04:00,800 --> 00:04:02,320
(Lin Xi's bathroom time)

69
00:04:25,300 --> 00:04:27,340
Go! Pass the ball!

70
00:04:27,340 --> 00:04:28,380
Pass it!

71
00:04:29,540 --> 00:04:30,580
Pass!

72
00:04:30,900 --> 00:04:31,940
Defend!

73
00:04:32,100 --> 00:04:33,540
Come back and defend the goal!

74
00:04:45,140 --> 00:04:45,940
Good morning, Xing.

75
00:04:46,060 --> 00:04:46,500
Good morning.

76
00:04:46,580 --> 00:04:46,900
Morning.

77
00:04:53,980 --> 00:04:55,500
Isn't it a bit too early

78
00:04:55,500 --> 00:04:56,340
for carbonated drinks?

79
00:04:56,820 --> 00:04:58,300
Don't worry. Mianmian won't mind.

80
00:04:58,300 --> 00:04:58,780
Thank you.

81
00:05:09,900 --> 00:05:10,980
You are really something.

82
00:05:11,220 --> 00:05:11,940
It turned out

83
00:05:11,940 --> 00:05:13,180
Ji Junxing really is a little rabbit.

84
00:05:15,020 --> 00:05:15,740
I've got to go.

85
00:05:25,080 --> 00:05:29,200
(Water Dispenser)

86
00:05:37,340 --> 00:05:38,340
You forgot your coke.

87
00:05:38,460 --> 00:05:38,980
No.

88
00:05:39,420 --> 00:05:40,700
You forgot your coke.

89
00:05:41,540 --> 00:05:42,820
Do you think you're in a commercial?

90
00:05:43,300 --> 00:05:44,860
You looked as if
you wanted to drink it rather badly.

91
00:05:46,700 --> 00:05:47,780
What's the matter?

92
00:05:48,060 --> 00:05:49,060
I'm not trying to give you a lecture,

93
00:05:49,260 --> 00:05:51,100
but it's a little too much
to pretend to be injured.

94
00:05:51,500 --> 00:05:52,780
Lin Xi did everything she could

95
00:05:52,780 --> 00:05:53,860
in the hope of being your friend.

96
00:05:53,860 --> 00:05:55,220
Aren't you moved by her sincerity?

97
00:05:55,820 --> 00:05:58,060
You are too cold-hearted.

98
00:05:58,900 --> 00:06:00,180
If she finds it difficult,

99
00:06:00,420 --> 00:06:01,820
the best thing she can do
is to give up now.

100
00:06:02,220 --> 00:06:03,660
Everything is great now, isn't it?

101
00:06:03,780 --> 00:06:04,500
We will just stay away
from each other's business.

102
00:06:04,980 --> 00:06:05,580
She's doing well,

103
00:06:06,420 --> 00:06:07,020
and I'm doing well too.

104
00:06:07,540 --> 00:06:09,260
In fact,

105
00:06:09,500 --> 00:06:10,460
I don't think she's doing well.

106
00:06:10,460 --> 00:06:11,540
I don't think you're doing well too.

107
00:06:12,060 --> 00:06:13,060
It's actually very easy

108
00:06:13,060 --> 00:06:14,220
to mollify a girl after you upset her.

109
00:06:14,300 --> 00:06:14,980
I'm very experienced in this.

110
00:06:14,980 --> 00:06:16,180
I can share
some of my experiences with you.

111
00:06:16,940 --> 00:06:17,660
Thank you,

112
00:06:17,900 --> 00:06:18,500
but it's fine.

113
00:06:19,980 --> 00:06:21,460
I'm just giving you
a small tip as a friend.

114
00:06:21,660 --> 00:06:23,060
Arrogance might feel good now,

115
00:06:23,300 --> 00:06:24,660
but it'll eventually lead you
to a dead end.

116
00:06:24,900 --> 00:06:27,500
Lin Xi is going to give up on you soon.

117
00:06:28,780 --> 00:06:29,740
I'm only doing all of this

118
00:06:29,740 --> 00:06:31,020
to keep her away from me.

119
00:06:31,380 --> 00:06:32,420
I can finally be at peace now

120
00:06:33,220 --> 00:06:34,180
and I feel great about it.

121
00:06:34,580 --> 00:06:36,340
I'm very happy too.

122
00:06:36,860 --> 00:06:37,980
Are you sure?

123
00:06:38,220 --> 00:06:38,900
Of course.

124
00:06:39,540 --> 00:06:40,340
Smile, then.

125
00:06:46,660 --> 00:06:48,100
Looking at you from the back,

126
00:06:48,100 --> 00:06:50,140
I can't help
but want to sing you a song.

127
00:06:50,560 --> 00:06:54,720
♪You are not truly happy♪

128
00:06:55,120 --> 00:06:59,170
♪Your smile is only a facade you put on♪

129
00:06:59,180 --> 00:07:01,460
In order to promote the construction
of spiritual civilization in our school,

130
00:07:01,460 --> 00:07:03,260
diversify our school's culture,

131
00:07:03,380 --> 00:07:05,180
build a harmonized
and civilized environment,

132
00:07:05,420 --> 00:07:06,780
and train our students to be stronger,

133
00:07:06,780 --> 00:07:08,260
so that they can keep striving
to achieve better results,

134
00:07:08,660 --> 00:07:09,340
we are going to organize

135
00:07:09,500 --> 00:07:11,220
the 15th Chunhui Basketball Tournament.

136
00:07:11,500 --> 00:07:13,660
Please join us.

137
00:07:15,180 --> 00:07:16,540
Our school is holding
a basketball tournament.

138
00:07:16,700 --> 00:07:17,540
When is it?

139
00:07:17,740 --> 00:07:18,940
Did our class participate
in the tournament last year?

140
00:07:19,060 --> 00:07:20,340
You're interested
in the basketball tournament?

141
00:07:20,460 --> 00:07:21,860
Of course.
It's the basketball tournament.

142
00:07:22,220 --> 00:07:22,980
I can be a manager,

143
00:07:22,980 --> 00:07:24,220
or a cheerleader,
or even handle the logistics.

144
00:07:24,740 --> 00:07:26,700
Why don't you find out more
about it first before...

145
00:07:26,700 --> 00:07:27,500
There's no need for that.

146
00:07:27,660 --> 00:07:28,500
You can do whatever you want.

147
00:07:28,740 --> 00:07:29,740
You can also have the honor
of doing a very difficult task too

148
00:07:29,740 --> 00:07:31,220
and handle the registration too.

149
00:07:32,380 --> 00:07:33,980
I will definitely complete the task
assigned by the organization.

150
00:07:33,980 --> 00:07:35,300
I'll never let the organization down.

151
00:07:37,380 --> 00:07:39,740
Both the organization
and I have faith in you.

152
00:07:39,980 --> 00:07:40,500
All the best.

153
00:07:41,900 --> 00:07:42,620
Xie Ang, why...

154
00:07:47,060 --> 00:07:48,580
I don't want to see you disappointed.

155
00:07:50,240 --> 00:07:52,360
(Progressive Erudite Humble)

156
00:08:03,100 --> 00:08:04,420
It's not making sense.

157
00:08:04,980 --> 00:08:05,660
Why isn't anyone here

158
00:08:05,660 --> 00:08:06,740
to register for the basketball game?

159
00:08:07,580 --> 00:08:09,020
You fell into Xie Ang's trap.

160
00:08:09,140 --> 00:08:10,540
This is a difficult task.

161
00:08:10,660 --> 00:08:11,700
What's going on?

162
00:08:12,380 --> 00:08:13,180
You haven't heard about this.

163
00:08:13,380 --> 00:08:14,460
There is a hierarchy

164
00:08:14,460 --> 00:08:15,780
for the Chunhui Basketball Tournament.

165
00:08:16,060 --> 00:08:17,900
The Art Class
despises the Science Class.

166
00:08:18,060 --> 00:08:19,780
The Science Class looks down
on the Literature Class.

167
00:08:20,020 --> 00:08:21,260
And we're stuck in the middle.

168
00:08:21,740 --> 00:08:22,780
I'm not done yet.

169
00:08:23,180 --> 00:08:24,660
The Art Class despises Class One.

170
00:08:29,060 --> 00:08:29,540
No way.

171
00:08:31,020 --> 00:08:32,180
I need to figure something out.

172
00:08:34,700 --> 00:08:35,940
Have you considered
joining the basketball tournament?

173
00:08:35,940 --> 00:08:37,540
Sign up now to get a sachet
of instant coffee for free.

174
00:08:37,740 --> 00:08:39,420
Refer a friend
and you'll get a chocolate bar for free.

175
00:08:39,420 --> 00:08:41,060
If two persons sign up together,
you'll get both freebies.

176
00:08:41,460 --> 00:08:42,220
The more contestants we get,
the more gifts we'll be giving out.

177
00:08:42,220 --> 00:08:43,580
Here's a free gift
for our first meeting.

178
00:08:45,580 --> 00:08:46,060
Hello.

179
00:08:46,940 --> 00:08:48,300
Please help us promote the game.
Thank you.

180
00:08:49,260 --> 00:08:49,740
Hello.

181
00:08:50,180 --> 00:08:52,100
Please promote the basketball tournament
to your friends.

182
00:08:52,340 --> 00:08:53,620
How trivial.

183
00:09:02,900 --> 00:09:03,500
Xie Ang.

184
00:09:04,340 --> 00:09:05,100
Think about it.

185
00:09:07,020 --> 00:09:07,660
Lin Xi.

186
00:09:07,980 --> 00:09:09,820
These deals are very attractive.

187
00:09:09,980 --> 00:09:11,180
I'm sold.

188
00:09:11,180 --> 00:09:11,980
So will you be joining us?

189
00:09:12,060 --> 00:09:12,540
No.

190
00:09:12,540 --> 00:09:13,580
I'll talk to you again
when you decide to join us.

191
00:09:14,500 --> 00:09:15,500
But I can refer a friend.

192
00:09:16,180 --> 00:09:16,700
Who's it?

193
00:09:17,300 --> 00:09:17,980
Your deskmate.

194
00:09:20,180 --> 00:09:20,900
That guy?

195
00:09:21,380 --> 00:09:23,660
Can he play basketball?

196
00:09:24,660 --> 00:09:26,140
I'll think about it

197
00:09:26,580 --> 00:09:27,740
if you are sincere enough.

198
00:09:29,180 --> 00:09:31,780
I don't think you're a good candidate.

199
00:09:32,500 --> 00:09:33,300
Why not?

200
00:09:33,820 --> 00:09:34,860
You just don't look like one.

201
00:09:35,020 --> 00:09:36,020
You look nothing

202
00:09:36,020 --> 00:09:37,260
like someone who plays basketball.

203
00:09:39,220 --> 00:09:39,740
Hello.

204
00:09:40,460 --> 00:09:42,060
Please help us share this
with your friends. Thank you.

205
00:09:42,780 --> 00:09:44,420
Hello. Please share it
with your friends.

206
00:09:44,540 --> 00:09:45,500
We're counting on you.

207
00:09:47,620 --> 00:09:52,540
Come on, Qin Kai!

208
00:10:02,100 --> 00:10:03,500
On your marks!

209
00:10:04,980 --> 00:10:06,300
Come on, Qin Kai!

210
00:10:10,860 --> 00:10:11,980
Ready!

211
00:10:19,660 --> 00:10:24,580
Come on, Qin Kai!

212
00:10:37,260 --> 00:10:39,300
Qin Kai, you did great!

213
00:10:39,300 --> 00:10:40,780
Have some water. You've worked hard.

214
00:10:40,780 --> 00:10:41,900
Thank you.

215
00:10:42,580 --> 00:10:43,100
Have some water.

216
00:10:44,100 --> 00:10:46,940
What? Who's this?

217
00:10:48,820 --> 00:10:49,500
What brings you here?

218
00:10:50,260 --> 00:10:51,220
It's my first time seeing you hurdling.

219
00:10:51,220 --> 00:10:52,300
You were amazing.

220
00:10:52,420 --> 00:10:53,420
I was just doing it casually.

221
00:10:53,420 --> 00:10:55,060
I'll show you what I can do
for a real competition one day.

222
00:10:55,660 --> 00:10:57,140
Are you looking for me?

223
00:10:57,260 --> 00:10:57,780
I happened to pass by,

224
00:10:57,780 --> 00:10:59,100
so I thought I would just deliver
some drinks to you.

225
00:10:59,260 --> 00:11:00,900
I don't receive drinks
from every Tom, Dick, and Harry.

226
00:11:01,220 --> 00:11:01,780
Precisely.

227
00:11:01,940 --> 00:11:03,180
I don't deliver drinks
to every Tom, Dick, and Harry too.

228
00:11:04,380 --> 00:11:04,900
Drink it.

229
00:11:05,260 --> 00:11:06,180
Drinking it

230
00:11:06,180 --> 00:11:07,580
means you've agreed to do me a favor.

231
00:11:09,020 --> 00:11:09,660
What?

232
00:11:09,780 --> 00:11:10,780
What have I agreed to?

233
00:11:11,020 --> 00:11:11,740
You'll be an aid

234
00:11:11,740 --> 00:11:13,020
to our class's basketball team.

235
00:11:37,620 --> 00:11:38,140
Hello.

236
00:11:38,420 --> 00:11:38,740
Hi.

237
00:11:38,740 --> 00:11:39,540
Can I have a cup of milk tea?

238
00:11:39,820 --> 00:11:40,140
Sure.

239
00:11:42,460 --> 00:11:43,780
Normal sugar level, add on pearl,

240
00:11:43,780 --> 00:11:45,260
Nata de coco, and grass jelly.

241
00:11:45,460 --> 00:11:46,540
I want all the add-ons.

242
00:11:46,860 --> 00:11:48,060
Wait a minute.

243
00:11:54,660 --> 00:11:55,340
That's it.

244
00:11:55,620 --> 00:11:56,460
I spent the whole day running around

245
00:11:56,460 --> 00:11:57,780
but I still fail
to form a basketball team.

246
00:11:58,820 --> 00:11:59,980
Just join us.

247
00:11:59,980 --> 00:12:01,500
We'll be a great team
if you can join us.

248
00:12:01,500 --> 00:12:02,980
I'll be dead if I join you.

249
00:12:03,620 --> 00:12:04,780
My classmates will send me
to an early grave

250
00:12:05,180 --> 00:12:07,020
if they find out that
I'm joining your team.

251
00:12:07,380 --> 00:12:09,140
Moreover, if I join your team,

252
00:12:09,260 --> 00:12:10,420
what about my classmates?

253
00:12:10,420 --> 00:12:11,420
What about my friends?

254
00:12:12,060 --> 00:12:13,300
I didn't expect

255
00:12:13,300 --> 00:12:14,260
a free man like you

256
00:12:14,260 --> 00:12:15,540
to care about collective honor.

257
00:12:15,740 --> 00:12:17,420
This is what we call sportsmanship.

258
00:12:21,700 --> 00:12:23,500
We've failed
before we even managed to do anything.

259
00:12:23,940 --> 00:12:25,140
It seems impossible

260
00:12:25,140 --> 00:12:26,300
for our basketball team
to turn things around.

261
00:12:26,740 --> 00:12:27,700
I think

262
00:12:27,700 --> 00:12:29,460
even if you manage to form a team,

263
00:12:29,460 --> 00:12:31,220
your class will be eliminated
at the preliminary round.

264
00:12:31,220 --> 00:12:32,260
It's the participation that matters.

265
00:12:32,260 --> 00:12:33,660
It's about sportsmanship.

266
00:12:34,900 --> 00:12:36,380
Other girls don't even know

267
00:12:36,380 --> 00:12:38,260
how many members are there
in a basketball team.

268
00:12:38,260 --> 00:12:40,380
But why are you so interested
in basketball?

269
00:12:42,220 --> 00:12:43,340
It's mainly

270
00:12:44,740 --> 00:12:46,020
because of my brother.

271
00:12:54,100 --> 00:12:55,380
(My brother was a fan of Kobe.)

272
00:12:55,740 --> 00:12:58,100
I used to play basketball with him
when we were little.

273
00:12:58,100 --> 00:12:59,540
We watched basketball games
together too.

274
00:13:00,180 --> 00:13:01,060
As time went by,

275
00:13:01,260 --> 00:13:02,700
I started to get interested
in basketball games too.

276
00:13:03,660 --> 00:13:04,980
That's great.

277
00:13:05,140 --> 00:13:06,980
Let's play together.

278
00:13:08,940 --> 00:13:09,340
What about you?

279
00:13:09,460 --> 00:13:10,420
Why do you like sports?

280
00:13:11,220 --> 00:13:12,460
I like the idea

281
00:13:12,580 --> 00:13:14,140
that you won't know who the winner is

282
00:13:14,140 --> 00:13:15,860
unless you fight until the final second.

283
00:13:16,540 --> 00:13:17,980
That's why we are friends.

284
00:13:18,860 --> 00:13:19,820
Exactly.

285
00:13:22,140 --> 00:13:22,740
Wait.

286
00:13:22,860 --> 00:13:24,700
How many basketball players
do you have in your class?

287
00:13:24,900 --> 00:13:27,220
Everyone in our class
can play basketball.

288
00:13:28,980 --> 00:13:29,780
Let's make a deal.

289
00:13:29,940 --> 00:13:31,100
You'll come and watch me play next time.

290
00:13:31,380 --> 00:13:32,060
I was

291
00:13:32,060 --> 00:13:33,620
Chunhui's most valuable player
last year.

292
00:13:33,900 --> 00:13:35,700
Sure. I want to see

293
00:13:35,700 --> 00:13:38,140
how good your three-pointer is.

294
00:13:38,140 --> 00:13:39,540
Just swish it.

295
00:13:39,540 --> 00:13:40,820
Everyone can do it.

296
00:13:41,580 --> 00:13:43,380
All right. You can go now.

297
00:13:44,180 --> 00:13:45,700
She has quite a number of friends.

298
00:14:13,220 --> 00:14:14,020
Where did everyone go?

299
00:14:18,660 --> 00:14:19,460
Lin Xi.

300
00:14:19,700 --> 00:14:20,740
You're amazing.

301
00:14:21,020 --> 00:14:23,180
There's finally a dream basketball team
from our class.

302
00:14:23,500 --> 00:14:24,500
Are you kidding me?

303
00:14:24,860 --> 00:14:25,540
It's true.

304
00:14:25,540 --> 00:14:27,300
They went out early in the morning
for the basketball practice.

305
00:14:27,300 --> 00:14:28,220
Come with me if you don't believe me.

306
00:14:29,260 --> 00:14:30,340
Let's go.

307
00:14:30,700 --> 00:14:31,420
It's true.

308
00:14:45,660 --> 00:14:46,700
Ji Junxing is here too.

309
00:14:47,820 --> 00:14:48,820
He's the captain.

310
00:14:49,140 --> 00:14:51,140
Can he play basketball?

311
00:14:51,460 --> 00:14:52,620
Why not?

312
00:14:52,620 --> 00:14:53,820
If there's only one guy in our class
who can play basketball,

313
00:14:53,820 --> 00:14:54,500
it has to be him.

314
00:14:54,780 --> 00:14:55,700
Others might not know about this.

315
00:14:55,700 --> 00:14:56,580
But we came

316
00:14:56,580 --> 00:14:57,740
from the same middle school.

317
00:14:57,900 --> 00:14:59,500
They called him Little Kobe.

318
00:14:59,620 --> 00:15:01,300
It's either he doesn't play,
or he'll win the game.

319
00:15:01,300 --> 00:15:03,300
You were in middle school.
Things might be different now.

320
00:15:03,460 --> 00:15:04,420
He's still doing pretty well now too.

321
00:15:06,860 --> 00:15:09,260
Do you find anything unusual

322
00:15:09,260 --> 00:15:11,020
when he's playing basketball?

323
00:15:11,020 --> 00:15:11,620
I do.

324
00:15:12,180 --> 00:15:13,380
He's unusually steady.

325
00:15:13,700 --> 00:15:15,420
With his help,
we'll surely win the tournament.

326
00:15:16,340 --> 00:15:16,900
Xie Ang.

327
00:15:18,100 --> 00:15:20,380
Has he recovered?

328
00:15:21,060 --> 00:15:21,700
What are you talking about?

329
00:15:22,780 --> 00:15:23,500
Nothing.

330
00:15:24,060 --> 00:15:25,660
Who are the others?

331
00:15:26,380 --> 00:15:27,620
The boy with the brightest smile

332
00:15:27,620 --> 00:15:28,660
is Gao Yunlang.

333
00:15:28,660 --> 00:15:30,740
He's nicknamed Cheerful Gao
and is a very good athlete.

334
00:15:30,740 --> 00:15:33,320
(Gao Yunlang, Cheerful,
Takes Chen Mo as his best friend.)

335
00:15:33,380 --> 00:15:34,780
The prettiest boy among the bunch

336
00:15:34,780 --> 00:15:35,420
is called Chen Mo.

337
00:15:36,260 --> 00:15:37,380
(Chen Mo. Studious, quiet, and gentle)
As his name suggests,

338
00:15:37,380 --> 00:15:39,420
(Gao Yunlang's best childhood friend)
he's quiet, gentle, and a laconic person.

339
00:15:39,620 --> 00:15:40,540
However, he is really good at math.

340
00:15:40,540 --> 00:15:42,300
He won the first place
in last year's Olympiad.

341
00:15:43,020 --> 00:15:43,900
That's Kai.

342
00:15:44,020 --> 00:15:45,100
He's very good at chemistry.

343
00:15:45,740 --> 00:15:47,140
And Xie Ang...

344
00:15:47,140 --> 00:15:48,620
I'll be very grateful as long as
he doesn't jeopardize the whole team.

345
00:15:48,860 --> 00:15:50,540
Anyway, all our class's top students

346
00:15:50,540 --> 00:15:51,260
are here.

347
00:15:52,540 --> 00:15:54,300
It sounds more
like a mathematics competition

348
00:15:54,460 --> 00:15:55,820
than a basketball tournament.

349
00:15:58,300 --> 00:15:59,620
You can leave now.

350
00:15:59,620 --> 00:16:01,300
Why are you playing basketball
early in the morning?

351
00:16:01,460 --> 00:16:02,460
Don't you need to study?

352
00:16:03,060 --> 00:16:03,820
Whether we need to study or not,

353
00:16:03,820 --> 00:16:04,980
it has nothing to do with you.

354
00:16:05,620 --> 00:16:06,820
Don't you know that the basketball court

355
00:16:06,820 --> 00:16:08,260
belongs to the Art Class in the morning?

356
00:16:09,660 --> 00:16:10,900
Did the school set the rule

357
00:16:10,900 --> 00:16:12,580
or did you come up with it yourselves?

358
00:16:12,900 --> 00:16:13,940
It doesn't matter who set the rule.

359
00:16:14,140 --> 00:16:15,700
We can have a match
if you're not happy with it.

360
00:16:15,700 --> 00:16:16,860
The winner gets to stay.

361
00:16:17,420 --> 00:16:18,260
What do you say, Kai?

362
00:16:18,660 --> 00:16:19,300
Sure.

363
00:16:20,460 --> 00:16:22,660
The skills will speak for themselves
on the court.

364
00:16:22,660 --> 00:16:24,580
We'll play one-on-one and
the first to score five points will win.

365
00:16:25,060 --> 00:16:25,820
Who's going to do it?

366
00:16:27,660 --> 00:16:28,260
You?

367
00:16:31,300 --> 00:16:32,860
Come at me.

368
00:16:34,140 --> 00:16:34,780
I'll do it.

369
00:16:38,100 --> 00:16:38,740
Sure.

370
00:16:39,500 --> 00:16:40,220
I'll play with you, then.

371
00:16:59,420 --> 00:17:00,820
Nice shot.

372
00:17:07,620 --> 00:17:08,300
What do we do now?

373
00:17:12,780 --> 00:17:16,820
Miss.

374
00:17:21,300 --> 00:17:23,780
He scored five points in a row.
They're now Class 12's rivals.

375
00:17:23,780 --> 00:17:25,380
He's just asking for trouble.

376
00:17:28,540 --> 00:17:30,700
It's not too late to admit defeat now.

377
00:17:34,940 --> 00:17:35,460
Give me the ball.

378
00:18:02,140 --> 00:18:03,180
Nice shot.

379
00:18:25,500 --> 00:18:26,500
Did you see it?

380
00:18:26,780 --> 00:18:28,060
We scored five clean shots.

381
00:18:28,500 --> 00:18:29,940
You barely scored the last shot.

382
00:18:29,940 --> 00:18:31,420
You only scored four and a half shots.

383
00:18:37,060 --> 00:18:38,740
Whatever. You can have the court.

384
00:18:38,980 --> 00:18:39,740
Let's go.

385
00:18:43,820 --> 00:18:44,420
Lin Xi.

386
00:18:45,220 --> 00:18:46,540
Drop by and watch me play next time.

387
00:18:48,540 --> 00:18:49,060
It's fine.

388
00:18:49,780 --> 00:18:51,220
Let me inform you

389
00:18:51,220 --> 00:18:52,460
that I'm now the manager

390
00:18:52,460 --> 00:18:53,420
of Class One, Grade Two's
basketball team.

391
00:18:53,420 --> 00:18:54,980
I also handle their logistics
and am their cheerleader.

392
00:18:55,420 --> 00:18:56,500
From now on, we're rivals.

393
00:18:57,500 --> 00:18:58,140
Sure.

394
00:18:58,140 --> 00:18:58,980
Good luck.

395
00:18:59,180 --> 00:19:00,940
I hope you'll do better than last year.

396
00:19:01,060 --> 00:19:01,860
I hope you can
get into the quarterfinals.

397
00:19:02,380 --> 00:19:03,900
We might even make it to the final.

398
00:19:04,580 --> 00:19:06,300
Do your best

399
00:19:06,540 --> 00:19:08,060
and win second place too.

400
00:19:24,660 --> 00:19:25,140
Kai.

401
00:19:25,500 --> 00:19:26,260
What are you looking at?

402
00:19:30,340 --> 00:19:31,020
Our opponent.

403
00:19:40,740 --> 00:19:42,100
Xing, well done.

404
00:19:42,100 --> 00:19:43,220
You scored five consecutive shots.

405
00:19:43,820 --> 00:19:45,140
You're quite a good basketball player.

406
00:19:45,660 --> 00:19:47,660
But are you feeling all right?

407
00:19:48,420 --> 00:19:50,620
Why? Do you think I'm weak?

408
00:19:51,060 --> 00:19:52,060
That's not what I meant,

409
00:19:52,540 --> 00:19:53,180
but

410
00:19:53,380 --> 00:19:54,940
let me know if you need help.

411
00:19:56,740 --> 00:19:57,660
Remember.

412
00:20:07,280 --> 00:20:11,240
(Realistic Progressive Erudite Humble)

413
00:20:14,140 --> 00:20:14,900
With Ji Junxing on our team,

414
00:20:14,900 --> 00:20:16,020
I'm very hopeful
that our class will win the tournament.

415
00:20:16,420 --> 00:20:17,940
Come on. We're counting on you

416
00:20:17,940 --> 00:20:19,060
to break Class One's curse.

417
00:20:19,340 --> 00:20:20,500
Come on.

418
00:20:21,540 --> 00:20:22,380
Wait a minute.

419
00:20:22,700 --> 00:20:24,100
Now that we have formed
a basketball team,

420
00:20:24,340 --> 00:20:26,500
it's time to sign our cheerleaders up.

421
00:20:28,580 --> 00:20:29,580
Wait a minute.

422
00:20:29,580 --> 00:20:30,660
I need to jot you down one by one.

423
00:20:31,420 --> 00:20:32,140
Go back to your seat.

424
00:20:34,780 --> 00:20:35,740
What are you doing?

425
00:20:36,900 --> 00:20:38,500
How long has the bell been ringing?

426
00:20:43,700 --> 00:20:44,980
This is outrageous.

427
00:20:45,420 --> 00:20:47,300
People are racing against time

428
00:20:47,300 --> 00:20:49,300
to work on worksheets
and memorize vocabulary,

429
00:20:49,300 --> 00:20:50,940
only hoping to score a better result
in the college entrance exam.

430
00:20:51,460 --> 00:20:52,220
But look at you.

431
00:20:52,660 --> 00:20:53,740
Basketball?

432
00:20:54,620 --> 00:20:56,100
You think you'll do
very well in the exam, right?

433
00:20:57,380 --> 00:20:58,620
In the previous monthly test,

434
00:20:58,620 --> 00:21:00,460
only six out of the top 20
are from our class.

435
00:21:01,180 --> 00:21:02,580
Are you still proud
of being a Science Class student?

436
00:21:02,740 --> 00:21:03,500
Aren't you ashamed of yourself?

437
00:21:04,380 --> 00:21:05,980
Aren't six a lot?

438
00:21:10,860 --> 00:21:12,540
Keep laughing.

439
00:21:13,060 --> 00:21:14,540
You'll start crying
during the college entrance exam.

440
00:21:15,900 --> 00:21:16,580
We're not joining

441
00:21:16,580 --> 00:21:17,620
the basketball tournament this time.

442
00:21:19,500 --> 00:21:20,740
Why not, Miss?

443
00:21:20,740 --> 00:21:22,140
Why not?

444
00:21:22,260 --> 00:21:24,300
Because you're not students
from the Art Class.

445
00:21:24,820 --> 00:21:26,620
Your priority is to secure
a place in the college.

446
00:21:26,980 --> 00:21:27,540
Let's start our class now!

447
00:21:47,340 --> 00:21:47,860
Kai.

448
00:21:48,180 --> 00:21:50,420
That was a very handsome shot.

449
00:21:51,100 --> 00:21:52,500
It's just something I always do.

450
00:21:54,580 --> 00:21:55,340
You're all here.

451
00:22:01,060 --> 00:22:01,740
What are you doing?

452
00:22:01,900 --> 00:22:03,060
Can't you see the water is mine?

453
00:22:03,180 --> 00:22:05,300
The water here is for everyone.

454
00:22:05,740 --> 00:22:06,540
Let's go, Xie Ang.

455
00:22:07,660 --> 00:22:08,340
Wait.

456
00:22:09,420 --> 00:22:10,780
You can have it.

457
00:22:11,100 --> 00:22:12,500
Since you can't play basketball,

458
00:22:12,500 --> 00:22:13,420
you can play with the water.

459
00:22:14,060 --> 00:22:14,820
What did you say?

460
00:22:15,300 --> 00:22:16,140
Don't talk rubbish.

461
00:22:16,940 --> 00:22:18,340
I'm not as good a talker as you.

462
00:22:18,940 --> 00:22:20,700
You're the best academically,

463
00:22:20,940 --> 00:22:23,540
but you're the worst
when it comes to basketball.

464
00:22:24,180 --> 00:22:24,980
I dare you to repeat it.

465
00:22:27,060 --> 00:22:28,860
You're the worst.

466
00:22:37,300 --> 00:22:38,780
Initially, I wasn't hopeful.

467
00:22:39,140 --> 00:22:40,180
Then, I saw hope.

468
00:22:40,580 --> 00:22:41,500
And now,
the hope was taken away from me again.

469
00:22:42,380 --> 00:22:44,140
It was really a dream team.

470
00:22:44,140 --> 00:22:45,380
It was just like a dream.

471
00:22:45,860 --> 00:22:46,660
I got it now.

472
00:22:47,460 --> 00:22:49,900
Basketball isn't Class One's curse.

473
00:22:50,900 --> 00:22:52,060
It's Miss Sun.

474
00:22:54,180 --> 00:22:56,140
Luckily, Ji Junxing no longer
has to participate in the tournament.

475
00:22:57,740 --> 00:22:59,500
Why do you dislike Ji Junxing?

476
00:23:00,500 --> 00:23:01,700
Oh, no.

477
00:23:01,700 --> 00:23:03,380
Our classmates have gotten into a fight
with the Art Class.

478
00:23:03,860 --> 00:23:04,660
What's going on?

479
00:23:05,260 --> 00:23:07,140
Let's go. Hurry up!

480
00:23:07,500 --> 00:23:08,540
What's the matter?

481
00:23:10,460 --> 00:23:11,220
Miss.

482
00:23:12,220 --> 00:23:12,740
Look.

483
00:23:18,780 --> 00:23:20,580
What happened? Why is there blood?

484
00:23:21,380 --> 00:23:22,700
It looks pretty bad.

485
00:23:23,300 --> 00:23:23,820
Where are they?

486
00:23:25,340 --> 00:23:26,860
It must be the doing of your students.

487
00:23:28,380 --> 00:23:29,220
Where are you going?

488
00:23:29,700 --> 00:23:30,580
I'm going to look for Mr. Xie.

489
00:23:31,740 --> 00:23:33,900
Listen. Calm down first.

490
00:23:44,460 --> 00:23:45,300
Say something.

491
00:23:46,380 --> 00:23:46,900
Dad.

492
00:23:47,020 --> 00:23:47,820
I'm not your dad.

493
00:23:49,060 --> 00:23:49,700
Come here.

494
00:23:56,460 --> 00:23:57,060
Does it hurt?

495
00:23:58,580 --> 00:23:59,220
You deserve it.

496
00:23:59,740 --> 00:24:02,020
You should've put your effort into
something else rather than fighting.

497
00:24:03,220 --> 00:24:03,700
Mr. Xie.

498
00:24:04,180 --> 00:24:05,500
We weren't fighting.

499
00:24:05,940 --> 00:24:06,820
You weren't fighting?

500
00:24:07,140 --> 00:24:08,300
Then, what happened

501
00:24:08,620 --> 00:24:10,060
to the wound on his face and his shirt?

502
00:24:11,020 --> 00:24:13,180
Dad, this...

503
00:24:16,580 --> 00:24:18,340
You're the best academically,

504
00:24:18,580 --> 00:24:21,180
but you're the worst
when it comes to basketball.

505
00:24:22,020 --> 00:24:22,820
I dare you to repeat it.

506
00:24:24,660 --> 00:24:26,460
You're the worst.

507
00:24:38,820 --> 00:24:39,780
My nose...

508
00:24:45,340 --> 00:24:46,060
Blood.

509
00:24:46,500 --> 00:24:47,780
My nose is bleeding.

510
00:24:50,460 --> 00:24:50,980
Mr. Xie.

511
00:24:51,340 --> 00:24:53,460
They only shared a hug.

512
00:24:57,740 --> 00:24:58,380
Fine.

513
00:24:58,780 --> 00:24:59,940
I'll not press on

514
00:25:00,020 --> 00:25:01,220
this matter.

515
00:25:03,580 --> 00:25:04,180
But

516
00:25:04,660 --> 00:25:06,860
you'll need to share a hug now.

517
00:25:07,100 --> 00:25:08,260
Then, I'll let this matter rest.

518
00:25:09,340 --> 00:25:10,380
Another hug?

519
00:25:10,980 --> 00:25:11,500
What's wrong?

520
00:25:11,980 --> 00:25:13,180
Don't you want to settle this here?

521
00:25:13,540 --> 00:25:14,620
Do you want to get punished?

522
00:25:24,380 --> 00:25:25,140
Go back now.

523
00:25:25,700 --> 00:25:26,620
Get back to class now.

524
00:25:30,460 --> 00:25:30,820
This...

525
00:25:31,460 --> 00:25:32,540
Mr... Mr. Xie.

526
00:25:32,900 --> 00:25:33,300
This...

527
00:25:34,220 --> 00:25:34,700
It's fine.

528
00:25:35,900 --> 00:25:36,700
You're here right on time.

529
00:25:36,700 --> 00:25:37,860
Bring them back to their classes.

530
00:25:38,260 --> 00:25:39,980
They weren't fighting.
It was just an accident.

531
00:25:42,820 --> 00:25:44,740
All right, Mr. Xie.

532
00:25:45,180 --> 00:25:46,060
Get back to your classes now.

533
00:25:46,220 --> 00:25:47,420
Go back now!

534
00:25:47,780 --> 00:25:48,340
Miss Sun.

535
00:25:49,660 --> 00:25:50,580
There's something else

536
00:25:50,580 --> 00:25:51,660
I want to tell you.

537
00:25:52,180 --> 00:25:52,860
What is it?

538
00:25:54,260 --> 00:25:55,100
This incident

539
00:25:55,500 --> 00:25:56,660
might appear like an accident,

540
00:25:57,420 --> 00:25:58,340
but actually, it's not.

541
00:25:59,780 --> 00:26:01,780
You disqualified Class One
from the basketball tournament,

542
00:26:02,220 --> 00:26:03,700
and we were really upset.

543
00:26:06,300 --> 00:26:06,820
Miss.

544
00:26:08,180 --> 00:26:08,940
It's not fair.

545
00:26:10,340 --> 00:26:11,260
We want to take part in the tournament.

546
00:26:12,380 --> 00:26:13,180
Enough.

547
00:26:13,180 --> 00:26:13,940
I won't allow that.

548
00:26:14,620 --> 00:26:15,100
Miss.

549
00:26:17,220 --> 00:26:18,020
You said

550
00:26:18,020 --> 00:26:19,500
that the basketball tournament
will affect our learning.

551
00:26:19,700 --> 00:26:20,780
But have you ever thought it through?

552
00:26:21,820 --> 00:26:22,980
If you don't allow us
to take part in the tournament,

553
00:26:23,180 --> 00:26:24,060
our low morale

554
00:26:24,060 --> 00:26:25,540
will affect our studies even worse.

555
00:26:27,780 --> 00:26:29,260
Is the basketball game so important?

556
00:26:29,500 --> 00:26:30,700
Will it help your college entrance exam?

557
00:26:31,820 --> 00:26:33,300
Can it be one of your specialties?

558
00:26:33,900 --> 00:26:34,500
Will it help you

559
00:26:34,500 --> 00:26:35,740
get a place in a reputable university?

560
00:26:37,580 --> 00:26:38,460
Yes, Miss.

561
00:26:38,980 --> 00:26:40,140
We need to
secure a place in the university.

562
00:26:40,940 --> 00:26:42,740
But college is not
the final stage of our life.

563
00:26:43,420 --> 00:26:44,900
If we miss the good experience in life

564
00:26:44,900 --> 00:26:46,460
because of this,

565
00:26:46,460 --> 00:26:47,660
life would be meaningless.

566
00:26:55,820 --> 00:26:57,180
Even if I allow you
to take part in the tournament,

567
00:26:57,940 --> 00:26:58,980
you would be eliminated
in the preliminary rounds.

568
00:26:59,460 --> 00:27:00,660
What's sportsmanship about?

569
00:27:01,620 --> 00:27:03,180
Higher, faster, and stronger.

570
00:27:03,460 --> 00:27:04,140
Can you beat

571
00:27:04,140 --> 00:27:05,260
those kids from the Art Class?

572
00:27:05,700 --> 00:27:06,660
Michael Jordan once said,

573
00:27:07,300 --> 00:27:08,660
"I can accept failure,

574
00:27:09,020 --> 00:27:10,980
but I can't accept not trying."

575
00:27:12,420 --> 00:27:13,380
Even if we lose the competition,

576
00:27:15,020 --> 00:27:16,340
it's still better than
giving up before trying.

577
00:27:22,620 --> 00:27:23,380
Miss Sun.

578
00:27:27,380 --> 00:27:28,820
Just give us a chance.

579
00:27:29,060 --> 00:27:30,500
We shouldn't be wasting our time

580
00:27:30,500 --> 00:27:31,700
being indecisive,
regretful, and anxious.

581
00:27:31,700 --> 00:27:33,180
We should make good use of the time
and play a good match.

582
00:27:34,020 --> 00:27:34,740
That's right, Miss.

583
00:27:35,140 --> 00:27:36,140
Sakuragi Hanamichi said

584
00:27:36,420 --> 00:27:37,380
that if you give up,

585
00:27:37,380 --> 00:27:38,780
the game is already over.

586
00:27:39,340 --> 00:27:41,340
Miss Sun, please let us do it.

587
00:27:41,660 --> 00:27:43,740
We promise that
we'll never neglect our studies.

588
00:27:47,020 --> 00:27:48,420
Let them do it.

589
00:27:49,060 --> 00:27:50,660
Don't make it look
like we're abusing them.

590
00:28:01,860 --> 00:28:03,180
If you wish to participate
in the tournament,

591
00:28:03,700 --> 00:28:04,780
you must do your best.

592
00:28:05,580 --> 00:28:06,580
Don't let the other students think

593
00:28:06,580 --> 00:28:07,660
that studying is the only thing

594
00:28:08,460 --> 00:28:09,420
students of Class One know.

595
00:28:10,220 --> 00:28:10,980
That's great!

596
00:28:18,860 --> 00:28:21,580
I'll see you at the basketball court.

597
00:28:22,820 --> 00:28:24,020
Don't be happy just yet.

598
00:28:25,300 --> 00:28:26,500
Our goal

599
00:28:27,340 --> 00:28:28,420
is to beat you.

600
00:28:32,260 --> 00:28:32,860
All right.

601
00:28:33,260 --> 00:28:34,300
Stop standing here.

602
00:28:34,300 --> 00:28:35,940
Meet me at my office.

603
00:28:35,940 --> 00:28:36,580
Go back to class.

604
00:28:36,900 --> 00:28:37,540
We can play basketball now.

605
00:28:37,540 --> 00:28:38,380
Wait a minute, Xie Ang.

606
00:28:41,620 --> 00:28:44,460
That quote was not from
Sakuragi Hanamichi.

607
00:28:47,380 --> 00:28:48,540
It was from Anzai-sensei.

608
00:28:53,100 --> 00:28:54,660
Miss Sun watched this series too?

609
00:28:55,140 --> 00:28:55,820
You watched it too.

610
00:28:55,820 --> 00:28:56,660
We can play basketball now.

611
00:28:57,980 --> 00:28:58,540
Ji Junxing.

612
00:28:58,780 --> 00:29:00,340
You were so cool just now.

613
00:29:00,820 --> 00:29:01,460
I agree.

614
00:29:01,900 --> 00:29:02,700
Wasn't I cool?

615
00:29:03,380 --> 00:29:04,820
Of course, you were.

616
00:29:05,100 --> 00:29:06,300
It was the first time
I thought you looked handsome.

617
00:29:06,940 --> 00:29:07,340
Good boy.

618
00:29:34,220 --> 00:29:35,060
Lin Xi.

619
00:29:42,580 --> 00:29:43,420
What are you looking at?

620
00:29:47,540 --> 00:29:48,820
Is there someone behind me?

621
00:30:02,460 --> 00:30:03,220
This time,

622
00:30:03,700 --> 00:30:05,500
I'm really impressed by what you did.

623
00:30:05,780 --> 00:30:06,980
You confronted Miss Sun alone

624
00:30:06,980 --> 00:30:08,780
to secure Class One's honor.

625
00:30:08,780 --> 00:30:09,860
I'm not that selfless.

626
00:30:10,100 --> 00:30:11,500
All I want is to play in
the basketball tournament.

627
00:30:11,940 --> 00:30:13,140
Do you want to play the game so badly?

628
00:30:13,540 --> 00:30:14,700
What if you get hurt?

629
00:30:14,700 --> 00:30:16,460
What... What if you hurt your arms,
legs, or...

630
00:30:18,860 --> 00:30:22,580
Or if anything happens
to your heart or your other organs?

631
00:30:23,580 --> 00:30:25,180
Are you worried about me?

632
00:30:25,860 --> 00:30:27,260
I'm worried about our class's performance
in the basketball tournament.

633
00:30:27,260 --> 00:30:28,060
I want to win.

634
00:30:28,540 --> 00:30:30,020
It's rare to see us
sharing the same goal.

635
00:30:32,780 --> 00:30:33,740
You can be my friend

636
00:30:34,380 --> 00:30:35,540
if I win.

637
00:30:38,380 --> 00:30:40,380
Don't you want to keep
your social circle exclusive?

638
00:30:41,380 --> 00:30:44,020
We need
some low-quality friends in life too.

639
00:30:44,260 --> 00:30:45,860
Your words, not mine.
Don't break your promise later.

640
00:30:46,780 --> 00:30:47,780
Say it again.
I want to keep a record of it.

641
00:30:47,780 --> 00:30:48,940
Golden words are not meant
to be repeated.

642
00:30:49,340 --> 00:30:50,500
You should go now.
I need to practice.

643
00:30:52,340 --> 00:30:53,700
I wasn't expecting this.

644
00:30:53,900 --> 00:30:55,340
The fox really outsmarted the rabbit.

645
00:30:56,300 --> 00:30:56,940
What are you talking about?

646
00:30:57,940 --> 00:30:58,460
Nothing.

647
00:30:58,780 --> 00:31:01,340
I mean, good job, my friend.

648
00:31:10,180 --> 00:31:11,180
Give me a high five, my friend.

649
00:31:11,620 --> 00:31:13,340
Didn't you say that we're friends?

650
00:31:14,620 --> 00:31:19,180
Come on!

651
00:31:21,540 --> 00:31:24,660
Come on!

652
00:31:27,580 --> 00:31:29,260
Class One, Grade Two
has advanced into the next round!

653
00:31:39,180 --> 00:31:40,980
Class 12, Grade Two
has advanced into the next round.

654
00:31:41,040 --> 00:31:42,820
(Final. Class 12, Grade Two
versus Class One, Grade Two)

655
00:31:42,820 --> 00:31:44,140
(Final. Class 12, Grade Two versus Class One, Grade Two)
Come on!

656
00:31:44,140 --> 00:31:44,900
Hey.

657
00:31:45,580 --> 00:31:46,740
Luck is on your side, huh?

658
00:31:46,860 --> 00:31:48,860
You actually managed
to get into the final.

659
00:31:49,580 --> 00:31:51,740
But now that
you're playing against us,

660
00:31:52,060 --> 00:31:53,700
you'll soon run out of luck.

661
00:31:54,300 --> 00:31:55,380
Don't get ahead of yourself.

662
00:31:55,740 --> 00:31:56,860
You might embarrass yourself soon.

663
00:32:12,780 --> 00:32:16,060
Class One. Class One. We are number one.

664
00:32:16,180 --> 00:32:19,300
Class One is the best.
Defy us and you shall be dead.

665
00:32:19,540 --> 00:32:20,340
See?

666
00:32:20,700 --> 00:32:22,260
This is what a winner looks like.

667
00:32:22,660 --> 00:32:23,980
We have
a very strong cheerleading team too.

668
00:32:24,540 --> 00:32:26,500
We're leading. We're going to win this.

669
00:32:27,100 --> 00:32:27,740
Isn't it nice?

670
00:32:28,420 --> 00:32:29,460
It is nice indeed.

671
00:32:30,140 --> 00:32:33,220
But we'll find out
who's the winner on the court.

672
00:32:33,660 --> 00:32:35,220
We are number one.

673
00:32:35,340 --> 00:32:36,580
Class One is the best.

674
00:32:36,580 --> 00:32:36,980
Let's go.

675
00:32:36,980 --> 00:32:38,540
Defy us and you shall be dead.

676
00:32:54,440 --> 00:32:55,280
(15th Chunhui Basketball Tournament)

677
00:33:02,860 --> 00:33:05,980
Class One is the best.
Defy us and you shall be dead.

678
00:33:13,220 --> 00:33:15,320
(Final. Class 12, Grade Two, 21,
versus Class One, Grade Two, 17.)

679
00:33:20,020 --> 00:33:23,620
Come on!

680
00:33:24,480 --> 00:33:26,760
(Final. Class 12, Grade Two, 42,
versus Class One, Grade Two, 41.)

681
00:33:31,460 --> 00:33:31,940
Okay.

682
00:33:51,920 --> 00:33:53,640
(Final. Class 12, Grade Two 75,
versus Class One, Grade Two, 72.)

683
00:34:08,340 --> 00:34:09,140
Are you all right?

684
00:34:09,740 --> 00:34:10,260
What's going on?

685
00:34:10,580 --> 00:34:11,100
Are you all right?

686
00:34:11,460 --> 00:34:12,220
I sprained my ankle.

687
00:34:12,580 --> 00:34:13,020
I'm fine.

688
00:34:13,660 --> 00:34:15,100
No. You won't be able to keep playing.

689
00:34:15,300 --> 00:34:16,100
Go to the infirmary now.

690
00:34:17,060 --> 00:34:17,500
Careful.

691
00:34:17,500 --> 00:34:18,620
It looks pretty serious.

692
00:34:19,780 --> 00:34:20,220
Ziyang.

693
00:34:20,740 --> 00:34:21,900
Bring him to the infirmary.

694
00:34:22,100 --> 00:34:22,460
Now.

695
00:34:27,180 --> 00:34:28,100
What do we do now?

696
00:34:28,540 --> 00:34:29,780
There are only five people in our class
who can play.

697
00:34:29,980 --> 00:34:31,020
We don't even have a substitute.

698
00:34:33,700 --> 00:34:34,780
Less than a minute left.

699
00:34:35,140 --> 00:34:36,220
Why don't you surrender now?

700
00:34:36,360 --> 00:34:37,300
(Final. Class 12, Grade Two,
versus Class One, Grade Two.)

701
00:34:37,300 --> 00:34:39,340
(Final. Class 12, 84, versus Class One, 81.)
You won't win anyway.

702
00:34:40,860 --> 00:34:41,380
That's right.

703
00:34:41,380 --> 00:34:42,220
Stop wasting our time.

704
00:34:42,220 --> 00:34:42,900
Just resign to your fate.

705
00:34:43,220 --> 00:34:43,780
Moreover,

706
00:34:44,220 --> 00:34:45,300
you have already done

707
00:34:45,540 --> 00:34:46,460
a pretty good job.

708
00:34:46,860 --> 00:34:48,060
You don't have any substitute, right?

709
00:34:51,860 --> 00:34:53,140
Who told you that
we don't have a substitute?

710
00:35:01,380 --> 00:35:01,900
Mianmian?

711
00:35:06,780 --> 00:35:07,780
There are no other substitutes, right?

712
00:35:08,620 --> 00:35:09,180
I'll do it.

713
00:35:10,940 --> 00:35:11,700
You?

714
00:35:11,900 --> 00:35:13,460
You're a girl. Can you really do it?

715
00:35:13,940 --> 00:35:14,900
Can't girls play?

716
00:35:15,060 --> 00:35:15,900
It's the Chunhui Basketball Tournament.

717
00:35:15,900 --> 00:35:17,100
There are no rules saying
that it's for boys only.

718
00:35:20,700 --> 00:35:21,980
Are you sure you can play basketball?

719
00:35:22,420 --> 00:35:23,340
Don't get ahead of yourself.

720
00:35:25,060 --> 00:35:25,620
Sir.

721
00:35:25,780 --> 00:35:26,700
Can I join the tournament?

722
00:35:27,260 --> 00:35:28,340
There are no rules in
the Chunhui Basketball Tournament

723
00:35:28,340 --> 00:35:30,060
saying that girls aren't allowed
to participate in the tournament.

724
00:35:30,420 --> 00:35:31,380
You're right.

725
00:35:31,820 --> 00:35:33,540
56 seconds left. The game will resume.

726
00:35:33,660 --> 00:35:34,420
Class One will have possession.

727
00:35:40,740 --> 00:35:43,980
Come on!

728
00:36:08,100 --> 00:36:10,420
Let me show you
what Black Mamba is made of.

729
00:36:14,860 --> 00:36:16,100
Use a feint

730
00:36:16,100 --> 00:36:17,820
to make the defender
lose his center of gravity.

731
00:36:18,260 --> 00:36:20,780
When the defender loses
his center of gravity,

732
00:36:20,980 --> 00:36:23,460
he will lose
his advantage of height too.
