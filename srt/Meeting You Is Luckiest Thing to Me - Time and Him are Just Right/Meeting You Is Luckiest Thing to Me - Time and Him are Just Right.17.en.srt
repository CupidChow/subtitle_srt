00:09:18,372 --> 00:09:19,092
You can get it yourself.

173
00:09:19,372 --> 00:09:21,172
Sister Lin Xi, I'll get it for you.

174
00:09:21,612 --> 00:09:22,852
Thank you.

175
00:09:22,852 --> 00:09:24,092
You're so thoughtful.

176
00:09:26,972 --> 00:09:27,532
Uncle,

177
00:09:28,132 --> 00:09:29,372
how are you feeling?

178
00:09:29,892 --> 00:09:30,612
I'm good.

179
00:09:30,612 --> 00:09:31,052
I feel good,

180
00:09:31,052 --> 00:09:31,972
especially today.

181
00:09:31,972 --> 00:09:32,932
I feel rejuvenated.

182
00:09:33,372 --> 00:09:34,812
Both of you should come and visit often.

183
00:09:34,812 --> 00:09:36,772
Your presence is more effective
than his medication.

184
00:09:37,012 --> 00:09:37,492
She's right.

185
00:09:37,772 --> 00:09:39,892
I'll come and stay here

186
00:09:39,892 --> 00:09:41,052
every winter and summer break.

187
00:09:41,932 --> 00:09:42,572
Sure.

188
00:09:42,932 --> 00:09:43,892
You're welcome to stay anytime.

189
00:09:44,572 --> 00:09:45,252
Eat up.

190
00:09:45,252 --> 00:09:46,532
After you finish your food,
I'll tidy the room for you.

191
00:09:46,532 --> 00:09:46,972
Is that okay?

192
00:09:47,812 --> 00:09:48,892
You don't have to come.

193
00:09:52,772 --> 00:09:53,572
Well,

194
00:09:53,572 --> 00:09:55,372
let me give you some food.

195
00:09:55,372 --> 00:09:55,692
Here.

196
00:09:55,892 --> 00:09:56,172
Here.

197
00:09:57,052 --> 00:09:57,932
Thank you.

198
00:10:12,292 --> 00:10:13,692
Thank you for coming to visit my dad.

199
00:10:14,212 --> 00:10:15,332
Today is his happiest day

200
00:10:15,332 --> 00:10:16,652
during this period.

201
00:10:17,172 --> 00:10:17,852
What about you?

202
00:10:18,572 --> 00:10:19,732
Are you feeling better now?

203
00:10:21,012 --> 00:10:21,812
Me?

204
00:10:22,212 --> 00:10:23,292
I'm doing fine.

205
00:10:24,212 --> 00:10:26,012
I always come here during this time.

206
00:10:26,212 --> 00:10:27,292
I'll eat the watermelon

207
00:10:27,292 --> 00:10:28,412
and gaze at the stars

208
00:10:28,412 --> 00:10:29,172
as I enjoy the breeze.

209
00:10:29,652 --> 00:10:31,092
I feel contented.

210
00:10:35,372 --> 00:10:36,812
Actually, you don't have

211
00:10:37,452 --> 00:10:39,132
to act tough in front of me
all the time.

212
00:10:52,212 --> 00:10:53,332
To be honest, I was scared

213
00:10:55,092 --> 00:10:56,292
that day.

214
00:10:58,132 --> 00:10:59,852
When I got the call,

215
00:11:00,532 --> 00:11:02,572
it felt the same
when I got the call about my brother.

216
00:11:18,600 --> 00:11:22,280
(China Human Organ Donation
Registration Form)

217
00:11:26,412 --> 00:11:28,252
The troublemakers
may have been arrested.

218
00:11:29,012 --> 00:11:30,492
But I'm really scared.

219
00:11:39,972 --> 00:11:41,052
It's already in the past.

220
00:11:43,372 --> 00:11:44,652
Your dad is recovering very quickly.

221
00:11:45,692 --> 00:11:46,692
It won't take long

222
00:11:47,372 --> 00:11:48,812
before he can get rid of the wheelchair

223
00:11:48,812 --> 00:11:50,012
and start jumping about.

224
00:11:53,692 --> 00:11:54,972
My dad said

225
00:11:55,652 --> 00:11:57,852
he'll play basketball with you
after he recovers.

226
00:11:58,052 --> 00:11:58,692
Sure.

227
00:12:06,972 --> 00:12:07,972
What about you?

228
00:12:08,532 --> 00:12:10,012
You've taken time off for a long time.

229
00:12:10,372 --> 00:12:11,772
What's your plan after this?

230
00:12:13,772 --> 00:12:14,252
Me?

231
00:12:15,372 --> 00:12:16,692
What can I even do?

232
00:12:17,612 --> 00:12:19,012
I failed the college entrance exam

233
00:12:19,012 --> 00:12:20,292
and didn't get into Jinghua University.

234
00:12:20,652 --> 00:12:21,932
So studying anywhere will be fine.

235
00:12:23,172 --> 00:12:23,892
Lin Xi,

236
00:12:25,052 --> 00:12:26,092
are you serious?

237
00:12:29,652 --> 00:12:31,012
I was just messing with you.

238
00:12:31,772 --> 00:12:33,572
I was the one who suggested studying
at Jinghua University.

239
00:12:33,572 --> 00:12:35,132
How can I go back on my word?

240
00:12:35,612 --> 00:12:38,292
So I'm preparing to repeat
my classes at Chunhui this year

241
00:12:38,292 --> 00:12:39,292
and strive for another year.

242
00:12:40,012 --> 00:12:41,012
I knew

243
00:12:41,212 --> 00:12:42,692
you wouldn't give up that easily.

244
00:12:43,332 --> 00:12:44,972
You really have that much faith in me?

245
00:12:46,692 --> 00:12:48,612
Because in terms of perseverance,

246
00:12:48,612 --> 00:12:50,012
no one can be compared to you.

247
00:12:59,972 --> 00:13:00,612
By the way,

248
00:13:01,172 --> 00:13:02,772
Jiang Yimian and the guys
asked me to tell you

249
00:13:03,052 --> 00:13:04,332
that we should get together
before leaving.

250
00:13:04,692 --> 00:13:05,652
Chen Mo is also back.

251
00:13:06,172 --> 00:13:06,932
Sure.

252
00:13:06,932 --> 00:13:07,732
Where are we going?

253
00:13:08,852 --> 00:13:10,012
They didn't tell.

254
00:13:10,012 --> 00:13:11,452
I think they'll pick the place.

255
00:13:25,052 --> 00:13:26,092
Wow!

256
00:13:26,412 --> 00:13:27,412
Ji Junxing

257
00:13:27,412 --> 00:13:28,932
is admitted to Jinghua University's
Department of Computer Science.

258
00:13:29,772 --> 00:13:30,812
Jiang Yimian,

259
00:13:30,812 --> 00:13:32,212
you're going to Jinghua University's
Department of Journalism.

260
00:13:33,092 --> 00:13:33,892
Xie Ang,

261
00:13:34,132 --> 00:13:35,532
you got
the Department of Public Administration.

262
00:13:35,932 --> 00:13:36,772
Chen Mo,

263
00:13:37,092 --> 00:13:38,092
you're going
to the Department of Physics.

264
00:13:38,732 --> 00:13:39,572
Gao Yunlang,

265
00:13:39,572 --> 00:13:41,252
you'll be going to
the Department of Civil Engineering.

266
00:13:42,612 --> 00:13:44,532
I'm so envious of you guys.

267
00:13:44,932 --> 00:13:46,292
Let me have some of your luck.

268
00:13:46,692 --> 00:13:47,412
Get all the luck you want.

269
00:13:51,812 --> 00:13:52,492
But

270
00:13:52,732 --> 00:13:54,572
are you guys leaving tomorrow?

271
00:13:55,132 --> 00:13:55,892
Yes.

272
00:13:56,132 --> 00:13:57,612
The freshmen need
to undergo military training.

273
00:13:59,012 --> 00:14:00,812
I feel sad to part with you guys.

274
00:14:01,732 --> 00:14:03,172
We feel the same too.

275
00:14:03,812 --> 00:14:04,532
It's okay.

276
00:14:05,172 --> 00:14:06,932
We'll explore Jingzhou on your behalf.

277
00:14:07,172 --> 00:14:08,852
We'll search for good food

278
00:14:08,852 --> 00:14:09,572
and places of attraction.

279
00:14:09,732 --> 00:14:10,332
When you come,

280
00:14:10,572 --> 00:14:11,772
you'll have a squad there.

281
00:14:11,972 --> 00:14:13,172
We'll wait for you to join us.

282
00:14:13,612 --> 00:14:14,892
Come on, what are you guys doing?

283
00:14:15,372 --> 00:14:16,812
It's not like we'll be apart forever.

284
00:14:16,812 --> 00:14:17,932
Don't be too sentimental.

285
00:14:18,372 --> 00:14:18,840
Over there.

286
00:14:18,840 --> 00:14:19,530
(The MIXC)

287
00:14:19,572 --> 00:14:21,572
We need to have a great time
before we leave.

288
00:14:21,892 --> 00:14:23,212
Yes, let's have fun.

289
00:14:23,212 --> 00:14:24,092
Let's go and have fun.

290
00:14:24,692 --> 00:14:25,372
Come on.

291
00:14:25,600 --> 00:14:28,840
(The MIXC)

292
00:14:36,732 --> 00:14:37,452
Nice.

293
00:14:43,252 --> 00:14:44,852
Have you packed your luggage yet?

294
00:14:45,132 --> 00:14:47,092
My mom stuffed my luggage

295
00:14:47,092 --> 00:14:49,092
with things like hangers,
liquid soap, and chopsticks

296
00:14:49,412 --> 00:14:50,932
as if she was setting up
a department store.

297
00:14:50,932 --> 00:14:51,772
That's nothing.

298
00:14:51,772 --> 00:14:53,092
My mom is even worse.

299
00:14:53,092 --> 00:14:54,492
My mom put three toilet rolls

300
00:14:54,492 --> 00:14:55,812
in my luggage.

301
00:14:56,932 --> 00:14:57,972
I can't believe
he had the nerve to say that.

302
00:14:58,332 --> 00:14:59,132
Really?

303
00:15:06,932 --> 00:15:08,652
How time flies.

304
00:15:09,332 --> 00:15:10,092
Yeah.

305
00:15:11,012 --> 00:15:12,212
It has been two years

306
00:15:12,212 --> 00:15:13,572
since we set up the East Gate Squad.

307
00:15:15,492 --> 00:15:16,692
You should thank me for that.

308
00:15:16,692 --> 00:15:17,852
If we didn't take you in,

309
00:15:17,852 --> 00:15:19,132
you would still be

310
00:15:19,132 --> 00:15:19,772
a lone ranger.

311
00:15:22,212 --> 00:15:24,372
I didn't expect
to be left out this time.

312
00:15:30,452 --> 00:15:31,492
Lin Xi.

313
00:15:33,052 --> 00:15:34,972
We all know how good you are.

314
00:15:35,572 --> 00:15:38,292
Actually, I see you as my role model,

315
00:15:38,292 --> 00:15:40,092
and I've always been keeping up
with you.

316
00:15:40,092 --> 00:15:41,652
That was how I managed
to get into Jinghua University.

317
00:15:42,052 --> 00:15:44,612
So you can definitely pass.

318
00:15:45,932 --> 00:15:46,852
Really?

319
00:15:47,212 --> 00:15:47,972
Yes.

320
00:15:49,332 --> 00:15:50,172
It's true.

321
00:15:51,412 --> 00:15:53,412
Everyone has their own pace.

322
00:15:54,252 --> 00:15:55,332
Some people are faster

323
00:15:55,852 --> 00:15:56,852
while some are slower.

324
00:15:57,532 --> 00:15:58,972
Don't worry about being left out

325
00:15:59,492 --> 00:16:00,772
because we'll always keep

326
00:16:00,772 --> 00:16:01,812
the same pace with you.

327
00:16:07,092 --> 00:16:08,172
Enough already.

328
00:16:08,852 --> 00:16:10,532
I've received all the love you give me.

329
00:16:11,052 --> 00:16:11,972
I promise

330
00:16:12,252 --> 00:16:13,852
I'll definitely join you guys next year.

331
00:16:13,852 --> 00:16:14,612
Cheers.

332
00:16:15,132 --> 00:16:16,612
Cheers.

333
00:16:19,132 --> 00:16:19,972
Xie Ang, cheers.

Bye.

00:17:28,652 --> 00:17:29,692
Watch your head.

352
00:17:29,692 --> 00:17:30,772
See you in Jingzhou.

353
00:17:34,892 --> 00:17:36,172
Be careful.

354
00:17:36,172 --> 00:17:37,212
Be careful, guys.

355
00:17:37,212 --> 00:17:38,132
Send her home.

356
00:17:38,132 --> 00:17:39,252
Mister, drive safely.

357
00:17:39,252 --> 00:17:39,772
Okay.

358
00:17:42,212 --> 00:17:43,052
We'll get going, then.

359
00:17:43,052 --> 00:17:44,172
Bye-bye.

360
00:17:53,372 --> 00:17:54,572
See you guys in Jingzhou!

361
00:18:01,212 --> 00:18:02,012
Lin Xi.

362
00:18:03,252 --> 00:18:04,212
Let's take a walk.

363
00:18:05,732 --> 00:18:06,452
Okay.

364
00:18:27,292 --> 00:18:28,772
When you reach Jinghua University,

365
00:18:29,172 --> 00:18:31,572
you'll make many new friends.

366
00:18:32,572 --> 00:18:34,372
Will you forget me, then?

367
00:18:35,852 --> 00:18:37,492
I'm not good at making friends.

368
00:18:38,172 --> 00:18:39,252
So without you there,

369
00:18:39,732 --> 00:18:41,372
I might be a lone ranger.

370
00:18:45,892 --> 00:18:46,572
By the way,

371
00:18:47,092 --> 00:18:48,452

373
00:18:57,052 --> 00:18:58,052

00:19:30,092 --> 00:19:31,292
This is a high-quality forgery.

384

your word.

392
00:20:17,452 --> 00:20:18,332
I'm here.

393
00:20:23,732 --> 00:20:26,212
I'll be off, then.

There are some important things
to take note of.

412
00:22:26,972 --> 00:22:28,332

What are you doing here?

440
00:23:49,972 --> 00:23:50,892
I'm going to study for another year

441
00:23:50,892 --> 00:23:51,732
just like you.

442
00:23:52,532 --> 00:23:54,212
I thought you were going to
a sports university.

443
00:23:54,972 --> 00:23:55,812
My dad doesn't think

444
00:23:55,812 --> 00:23:57,852
that university is good enough.

445
00:23:57,852 --> 00:23:59,292
If I don't study for another year,

446
00:23:59,292 --> 00:24:01,332
my dad will send me overseas.

447
00:24:01,332 --> 00:24:03,412
Rather than wasting four years
of my time,

448
00:24:03,692 --> 00:24:05,012
it's better to strive for one more year

449
00:24:05,412 --> 00:24:07,292
and get into Jinghua Sports University.

450
00:24:07,892 --> 00:24:08,812
Not bad.

451
00:24:09,172 --> 00:24:10,972
You rarely have such an awareness.

452
00:24:10,972 --> 00:24:12,692
Seeing how you're determined
to go all out,

453
00:24:12,692 --> 00:24:13,612

can you tutor me again?

Seeing how you take this seriously,

457
00:24:23,252 --> 00:24:24,372

that Ji Junxing

463
00:24:37,292 --> 00:24:39,212
would be addicted to WeChat.

Xing,

465
00:24:45,652 --> 00:24:46,572
you better lift your head

466
00:24:46,572 --> 00:24:48,452
and look at these campaigns
by the clubs.

467

468

Street dance, Go,
and investigative club.

470
00:24:56,372 --> 00:24:57,812
I don't see a game club anywhere.

471
00:24:58,972 --> 00:25:01,212
One of my roommates joined
a crosstalk club.

472
00:25:01,212 --> 00:25:02,492
One is doing allegro

473
00:25:02,492 --> 00:25:03,612
while the other one joins the rappers.

474
00:25:03,892 --> 00:25:04,732
Can you imagine

475
00:25:04,732 --> 00:25:06,292
how happy I am at my dormitory?

476
00:25:09,452 --> 00:25:10,612
Excuse me.

477
00:25:11,172 --> 00:25:12,612
My friends are over there.

478
00:25:12,612 --> 00:25:14,652
She said she fell in love with you
at first sight.

479
00:25:14,652 --> 00:25:16,132
She wonders if she can be your friend.

480
00:25:16,612 --> 00:25:17,572
I'm sorry.

481
00:25:17,572 --> 00:25:18,892
I don't add strangers
as my contact on WeChat.

482
00:25:20,732 --> 00:25:21,492
Thanks.

483
00:25:26,372 --> 00:25:28,492
That's the third person
who got her heart broken today.

484

487
00:25:39,772 --> 00:25:41,212
Where's the girl you were with?

488
00:25:41,452 --> 00:25:42,532
Why is she not here?

489
00:25:43,172 --> 00:25:44,692
Something happened when
she's sitting for college entrance exam.

490
00:25:44,692 --> 00:25:45,532
So she had to repeat her classes.

491
00:25:46,412 --> 00:25:47,212
Well,

492
00:25:47,212 --> 00:25:48,692
she can only do it next year.

493
00:25:49,212 --> 00:25:50,292
This is...

494
00:25:52,372 --> 00:25:53,092

Nice to meet you guys.

498
00:25:56,972 --> 00:25:57,532
By the way,

499
00:25:57,932 --> 00:25:59,132
have you registered for any clubs yet?

500
00:25:59,132 --> 00:26:00,812
Do you want to join the Drama Club?

501
00:26:00,812 --> 00:26:01,772
Let's have fun together.

502
00:26:06,212 --> 00:26:07,332
Drama Club?

503
00:26:07,652 --> 00:26:08,652
I can join.

504
00:26:13,692 --> 00:26:14,492
Help me move

505
00:26:14,492 --> 00:26:15,852
this sofa a little more this way.

506
00:26:15,852 --> 00:26:16,412
Okay.

507
00:26:16,412 --> 00:26:17,052
Be careful with this.

508
00:26:17,052 --> 00:26:18,132
Don't drop it.

509
00:26:18,132 --> 00:26:18,692
Okay.

510
00:26:23,012 --> 00:26:24,612
Excuse me, Stage Director.

511
00:26:25,172 --> 00:26:26,252
Can you change

512
00:26:26,252 --> 00:26:27,532
the backdrop scene for me?

513
00:26:28,932 --> 00:26:29,292
Yes, this one.

514
00:26:29,292 --> 00:26:30,012
Thank you.

515
00:26:31,692 --> 00:26:32,452
(Lin Xi,)

516
00:26:32,932 --> 00:26:34,252
(how are you doing lately?)

517
00:26:34,772 --> 00:26:35,332
(During this period,)

518
00:26:35,332 --> 00:26:37,132
(we joined many clubs.)

519
00:26:37,132 --> 00:26:39,412
My luggage is on board now.

520
00:26:39,852 --> 00:26:40,692
See you.

521
00:26:41,212 --> 00:26:42,932
When the weather is fine to set sail,

522
00:26:43,212 --> 00:26:44,492
remember to write to me.

523
00:26:45,332 --> 00:26:46,892
You don't have to worry about this,

524
00:26:47,252 --> 00:26:48,372
my brother.

525
00:26:50,852 --> 00:26:53,732
As for Hamlet's interest in you,

526
00:26:53,732 --> 00:26:54,412
it's nothing

527
00:26:54,412 --> 00:26:56,452
but a short-lived affection.

528
00:26:56,812 --> 00:26:58,452
(Gao Yunlang joined
the Basketball Club.)

529
00:26:59,292 --> 00:27:00,812
(Chen Mo joined the Astronomy Club.)

530
00:27:01,212 --> 00:27:02,812
(Jiang Yimian joined the Kungfu Club.)

531
00:27:03,452 --> 00:27:05,332
(Xie Ang dragged several of us)

532
00:27:05,332 --> 00:27:06,692
(to join the Drama Club.)

533
00:27:07,172 --> 00:27:09,972
(We are forced to do the play
with him every day.)

534
00:27:10,732 --> 00:27:11,412
(If you ask me,)

535
00:27:11,412 --> 00:27:13,212
(he's making up for all the plays)

536
00:27:13,212 --> 00:27:14,252
(he didn't play in high school.)

537
00:27:14,972 --> 00:27:15,652
(By the way,)

538
00:27:16,212 --> 00:27:17,292
(the club president is the senior)

539
00:27:17,292 --> 00:27:19,492
(we met at Jinghua University before,
Wei Mingya.)

540
00:27:21,732 --> 00:27:25,532
Perhaps he's truly in love with you now.

541
00:27:25,812 --> 00:27:28,212
Perhaps he's a gentleman.

542
00:27:28,692 --> 00:27:30,052
But you must consider

543
00:27:30,052 --> 00:27:31,452
that he doesn't own his will

544
00:27:31,732 --> 00:27:33,852
or the freedom of an ordinary person

545
00:27:33,852 --> 00:27:35,532
due to his background and status.

546
00:27:47,892 --> 00:27:48,252
All right.

547
00:27:48,252 --> 00:27:49,692
You can have your mobile phone back.

548
00:27:49,692 --> 00:27:51,452
Remember to hand it over at 7PM.

549
00:27:52,732 --> 00:27:53,612
- My phone.
- My phone.

550
00:28:05,812 --> 00:28:06,412
Hello?

551
00:28:06,972 --> 00:28:08,292
You answered my call pretty quickly.

552
00:28:09,212 --> 00:28:10,612
I know you're getting
your mobile phone today.

553
00:28:10,612 --> 00:28:11,652
So I've been waiting.

554
00:28:13,052 --> 00:28:14,612
Wait. It's too noisy in the class.

555
00:28:14,612 --> 00:28:15,532
I'll go outside and talk to you.

556
00:28:19,612 --> 00:28:21,692
I've read your messages.

557
00:28:21,692 --> 00:28:23,412
It sounds fun joining the clubs.

558
00:28:24,492 --> 00:28:25,492
I'm so jealous.

559
00:28:26,372 --> 00:28:27,332
What about you?

560
00:28:27,332 --> 00:28:28,412
How have you been doing?

561
00:28:29,052 --> 00:28:29,892
I...

562
00:28:30,692 --> 00:28:31,492
I thought

563
00:28:31,492 --> 00:28:33,212
Grade 12 and 13 are similar.

564
00:28:33,572 --> 00:28:35,092
But I was too naive.

565
00:28:35,892 --> 00:28:37,812
The repeaters are terrifying.

566
00:28:37,812 --> 00:28:39,532
We have several repeaters in our class
who scored over 700 marks.

567
00:28:39,532 --> 00:28:39,972
But they said

568
00:28:39,972 --> 00:28:41,252
they were not satisfied
because they didn't get

569
00:28:41,252 --> 00:28:42,212
the major they applied for.

570
00:28:44,652 --> 00:28:45,492
Let's not talk about me.

571
00:28:46,052 --> 00:28:46,932
What about the rest?

572
00:28:47,932 --> 00:28:49,012
I forgot to tell you

573
00:28:49,012 --> 00:28:50,532
that Xie Ang is wooing Jiang Yimian.

574
00:28:50,812 --> 00:28:53,092
He invited her to a music festival
two days ago.

575
00:28:53,492 --> 00:28:54,652
What happened after that?

576
00:28:55,492 --> 00:28:57,612
It didn't go well

577
00:28:57,612 --> 00:28:58,932
because Xie Ang bought scalped tickets

578
00:28:58,932 --> 00:29:00,652
so he could save money.

579
00:29:01,532 --> 00:29:02,892
He bought fake tickets again?

580
00:29:03,212 --> 00:29:05,332
Nothing seems to go well with those two
when it comes to the music festival.

581
00:29:06,692 --> 00:29:08,492
What about Chen Mo and Gao Yunlang?

582
00:29:08,972 --> 00:29:11,092
Chen Mo is always at the library,

583
00:29:11,092 --> 00:29:12,972
reading works by physicists
from all over the world.

584
00:29:13,732 --> 00:29:15,532
Gao Yunlang is pretty popular recently.

585
00:29:15,532 --> 00:29:16,932
He receives a lot of love letters.

586
00:29:20,052 --> 00:29:21,692
Then did you not receive

587
00:29:21,692 --> 00:29:23,692
any love letters from girls?

588
00:29:24,732 --> 00:29:25,492
No.

589
00:29:29,332 --> 00:29:32,852
Does this mean you're no longer popular?

590
00:29:32,852 --> 00:29:34,612
Do you need me to help you out?

591
00:29:35,372 --> 00:29:36,172
That's not necessary.

592
00:29:36,172 --> 00:29:37,812
They directly asked for my WeChat ID.

593
00:29:40,092 --> 00:29:41,292
All right, then.

594
00:29:41,612 --> 00:29:42,932
I hope you enjoy making new friends.

595
00:29:45,172 --> 00:29:46,412
Are you jealous?

596
00:29:47,412 --> 00:29:48,172
No, I'm not.

597
00:29:49,292 --> 00:29:50,932
You can be jealous occasionally.

598
00:29:52,012 --> 00:29:54,412
Why would I be jealous?

599
00:29:55,532 --> 00:29:56,452
It's your choice, then.

600
00:29:57,092 --> 00:29:58,212
But don't worry.

601
00:29:58,412 --> 00:29:59,772
I don't like other girls.

602
00:29:59,772 --> 00:30:01,132
No matter how great they are,

603
00:30:01,132 --> 00:30:02,852
I only want to date a junior

604

605

606
00:30:12,292 --> 00:30:13,812
your birthday next Saturday?

607
00:30:14,692 --> 00:30:15,972
They already have plans.

608
00:30:16,372 --> 00:30:18,092
I also have rehearsal at the club.

609
00:30:18,332 --> 00:30:19,612
I think I'll celebrate it myself.

610
00:30:20,332 --> 00:30:21,612
That would be boring.

611
00:30:23,852 --> 00:30:25,732

Look at this.

644
00:32:36,972 --> 00:32:38,612
I scored 86 for Chinese.

Not bad.

You scored 20 marks higher this time.

647
00:32:41,212 --> 00:32:42,572
It's all thanks to you

a composition beforehand.

Does he know

670
00:33:41,132 --> 00:33:41,972
you're doing all this for him?

671
00:33:41,972 --> 00:33:43,052
Of course, he doesn't.

672
00:33:43,052 --> 00:33:44,492
It won't be a surprise if he knows.

What if he forgets?

674

That's not possible.

675
00:33:50,892 --> 00:33:52,172
He's definitely going to be happy

676

that I'm celebrating his birthday
for him.

He's probably busy.

679
00:34:18,612 --> 00:34:20,572
I didn't tell him I was going to make
a video call to him.

680
00:34:21,732 --> 00:34:22,772
All right.

681
00:34:22,772 --> 00:34:23,852
You can continue.

682
00:34:32,612 --> 00:34:33,332
Jun,

683
00:34:33,732 --> 00:34:34,612
where are the rest?

684
00:34:35,172 --> 00:34:36,212
They left.

685
00:34:36,972 --> 00:34:38,052
Then I'll get going too.

686
00:34:38,052 --> 00:34:39,132
I'll see you at the next rehearsal.

687
00:34:39,132 --> 00:34:39,772
Okay, see you.

688
00:34:39,772 --> 00:34:40,532
See you.

Ji Junxing,

695
00:35:10,212 --> 00:35:11,212
happy birthday!

696
00:35:11,212 --> 00:35:13,212
- Happy birthday to you!
- Happy birthday to you!

697
00:35:13,212 --> 00:35:13,932
Mingya,

698
00:35:13,932 --> 00:35:15,132
did you set this up?

699
00:35:15,132 --> 00:35:16,092
Of course.

700
00:35:16,092 --> 00:35:17,892
This is the Drama Club's tradition.

701
00:35:17,892 --> 00:35:19,532
We always prepare a surprise

702
00:35:19,532 --> 00:35:20,972
for our members' birthdays.

703
00:35:20,972 --> 00:35:22,052
Make a wish.

704
00:35:22,052 --> 00:35:23,372
- Make a wish.
- Make a wish.

705
00:35:23,372 --> 00:35:23,892
Okay.

706
00:35:30,492 --> 00:35:31,492
Happy birthday!

707
00:35:31,492 --> 00:35:32,972
- Happy birthday!
- Happy birthday!

708
00:35:32,972 --> 00:35:34,612
Time to blow out the candle.

709
00:35:36,172 --> 00:35:37,412
Happy birthday!

710
00:35:37,412 --> 00:35:38,412
Thank you, guys.

711
00:35:45,132 --> 00:35:46,412
Is he still not answering?

712
00:35:47,132 --> 00:35:48,852
I've won MVP title for several times.

713
00:35:50,132 --> 00:35:51,212
Why are you so impatient?

714
00:35:51,612 --> 00:35:52,652
Well, I'm not.

715
00:35:52,652 --> 00:35:53,652
But the candle is.

716
00:35:53,652 --> 00:35:55,212
The candle is almost gone now.

717
00:35:56,132 --> 00:35:57,412
You better be quick.

718
00:35:57,412 --> 00:35:59,172
The teacher will lock
the computer room soon.

719
00:35:59,532 --> 00:36:00,372
Why

720
00:36:00,692 --> 00:36:02,052
don't you leave him a message?

721
00:36:03,972 --> 00:36:04,892
All right.

722
00:36:05,692 --> 00:36:07,052
I must not let my trip here be in vain.

723
00:36:11,732 --> 00:36:12,972
Who's this?

724
00:36:13,612 --> 00:36:15,012
It looks like a girl.

725
00:36:15,972 --> 00:36:18,012
She's the first person
to like his every post.

726
00:36:19,052 --> 00:36:20,612
They seem to be pretty close.

727
00:36:21,772 --> 00:36:23,052
Wei Mingya.

728
00:36:24,092 --> 00:36:25,052
Oh, it's her.

729
00:36:25,052 --> 00:36:25,532
I know her.

730
00:36:25,532 --> 00:36:26,332
She's a senior.

731
00:36:26,732 --> 00:36:27,732
Let me see.

732
00:36:27,972 --> 00:36:28,852
Why are you looking

733
00:36:28,852 --> 00:36:29,692
at other people's privacy?

734
00:36:29,692 --> 00:36:31,252
Just let me have a look.

735
00:36:33,620 --> 00:36:36,040
(Celebrating beloved junior,
Ji Junxing's 19th birthday.)

736
00:36:40,880 --> 00:36:43,480
(Let's have fun together forever!)

737
00:36:45,172 --> 00:36:46,132
It's nothing.

738
00:36:46,492 --> 00:36:47,412
It's just a birthday celebration.

739
00:36:47,412 --> 00:36:49,132
It's normal to hang out with friends.

740
00:36:50,412 --> 00:36:51,412
It's no big deal.

741
00:37:04,012 --> 00:37:05,212
It's only a birthday celebration.

742
00:37:16,772 --> 00:37:17,732
I'll get going then.

743
00:37:18,972 --> 00:37:19,932
I'll go with you.

744
00:37:27,652 --> 00:37:30,372
Aren't you going
to ask Ji Junxing to explain?

745
00:37:31,332 --> 00:37:32,452
What's there to ask?

746
00:37:33,052 --> 00:37:34,532
They were just celebrating his birthday.

747
00:37:34,972 --> 00:37:36,652
If you ask me,

748
00:37:36,652 --> 00:37:38,212
it's just a normal social life
at the university.

749
00:37:38,892 --> 00:37:41,412
So is it normal to smear cake
on the face when you're socializing

750
00:37:41,412 --> 00:37:42,972
and post a photo together?

751
00:37:44,692 --> 00:37:45,932
When it's your birthday,

752
00:37:45,932 --> 00:37:47,652
I'll smear cake on your face

753
00:37:47,652 --> 00:37:49,012
and take pictures with you.

754
00:37:50,772 --> 00:37:52,252
Don't pull a long face.

755
00:37:52,532 --> 00:37:53,492
In my opinion,

756
00:37:53,492 --> 00:37:54,852
both of you have reached

757
00:37:54,852 --> 00:37:55,932
the phase of the cooling period.

758
00:37:55,932 --> 00:37:57,052
This is what happens

759
00:37:57,052 --> 00:37:58,252
when two people are apart.

760
00:37:58,612 --> 00:38:00,652
You'd talk on the phone every day
in the beginning.

761
00:38:00,892 --> 00:38:01,652
But it would take

762
00:38:01,652 --> 00:38:02,772
about one or two months at most

763
00:38:03,012 --> 00:38:05,452
before you start treating
each other coldly.

764
00:38:05,772 --> 00:38:06,652
Then

765
00:38:07,052 --> 00:38:07,932
you'll feel cold.

766
00:38:07,932 --> 00:38:08,732
Your feelings start to feel numb

767
00:38:09,092 --> 00:38:10,172
and finally are gone.

768
00:38:13,212 --> 00:38:14,092
Do you want some?

769
00:38:15,132 --> 00:38:16,012
Are you really giving it to me?

770
00:38:17,452 --> 00:38:18,372
It's to shut your mouth.

771
00:38:19,132 --> 00:38:20,892
Don't be mad at me.

772
00:38:21,772 --> 00:38:22,292
If you can't endure it,

773
00:38:22,292 --> 00:38:23,932
you can call and ask him.

774
00:38:25,132 --> 00:38:26,572
I wanted to call him too.

775
00:38:26,572 --> 00:38:27,452
But I have no phone.

776
00:38:28,332 --> 00:38:29,052
Hold this.

777
00:38:29,852 --> 00:38:30,572
I said, hold it.

778
00:38:30,972 --> 00:38:32,172
Getting a phone is a piece of cake.

779
00:38:32,172 --> 00:38:32,892
Wait here.

780
00:38:35,132 --> 00:38:35,852
Excuse me.

781
00:38:35,852 --> 00:38:37,292
Can you lend me your mobile phone?

782
00:38:38,812 --> 00:38:39,452
Here's the rental fee.

783
00:38:39,452 --> 00:38:39,972
Okay.

784
00:38:40,412 --> 00:38:41,172
Thanks, man.

785
00:38:44,132 --> 00:38:44,812
Here you go.

786
00:38:44,812 --> 00:38:45,772
Call him.

787
00:38:47,252 --> 00:38:47,932
Okay.

788
00:38:47,932 --> 00:38:49,172
I memorized his number.

789
00:38:49,172 --> 00:38:50,012
I'll call him.

790
00:38:56,652 --> 00:38:57,252
What do you think?

791
00:38:57,252 --> 00:38:58,492
Does the cake taste good?

792
00:39:15,052 --> 00:39:15,732
Hello?

793
00:39:16,292 --> 00:39:16,972
Hello?

794
00:39:19,692 --> 00:39:21,412
Hello, are you looking for Ji Junxing?

795
00:39:22,252 --> 00:39:22,692
What?

796
00:39:22,692 --> 00:39:23,732
Who are you?

797
00:39:24,412 --> 00:39:26,172
Why are you asking
when you're the one calling?

798
00:39:26,172 --> 00:39:27,892
I should be asking who you are.

799
00:39:32,772 --> 00:39:33,292
I'm leaving.

800
00:39:34,212 --> 00:39:35,212
Don't follow me.

801
00:39:35,932 --> 00:39:37,132
I want to be alone.

802
00:39:54,332 --> 00:39:55,252
Thanks for the phone.

803
00:39:55,252 --> 00:39:55,852
Don't mention it.

804
00:40:00,612 --> 00:40:02,012
Bye-bye.

805
00:40:04,172 --> 00:40:05,172
Ji Junxing,

806
00:40:05,292 --> 00:40:06,892
someone made a prank call
to you just now.

807
00:40:06,892 --> 00:40:08,132
I already blocked the number for you.

808
00:40:08,492 --> 00:40:09,212
Thanks.

809
00:40:09,772 --> 00:40:10,452
I still have something to do.

810
00:40:10,452 --> 00:40:11,092
So I'll get going first.

811
00:40:11,412 --> 00:40:12,132
See you at the next rehearsal.

812
00:40:13,012 --> 00:40:14,372
Thank you for the cake.

813
00:40:14,732 --> 00:40:15,452
It's no big deal.

814
00:40:15,452 --> 00:40:15,812
We'll get going now.

815
00:40:15,812 --> 00:40:16,052
Mingya,

816
00:40:16,052 --> 00:40:17,092
let's go together.

817
00:40:17,372 --> 00:40:18,012
Okay.

818
00:40:18,292 --> 00:40:18,772
Bye-bye.

819
00:40:19,212 --> 00:40:19,892
Bye-bye.
