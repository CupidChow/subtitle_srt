17

You are here.

18
00:02:06,793 --> 00:02:07,673
Why do you ask for me

19
00:02:07,673 --> 00:02:08,593
this late at night?

20
00:02:10,873 --> 00:02:11,953
How much did you drink?

21
00:02:12,553 --> 00:02:13,593
Not much.

22
00:02:13,953 --> 00:02:14,753
Just

23
00:02:16,113 --> 00:02:22,113
one, two, three, four, five, six.

24
00:02:30,793 --> 00:02:31,353
Here you go.

25
00:02:34,073 --> 00:02:34,873
The seventh.

26
00:02:38,553 --> 00:02:39,193
Let's drink.

27
00:02:53,913 --> 00:02:54,753
Are you done?

28
00:02:55,193 --> 00:02:56,353
If you are, get home now.

29
00:02:57,153 --> 00:02:58,033
Come on.

30
00:02:58,593 --> 00:02:59,793
Yueyue and I broke up.

31
00:03:19,153 --> 00:03:19,953
Who ended it?

32
00:03:22,513 --> 00:03:23,113
She did.

33
00:03:24,753 --> 00:03:26,193
You should learn from Xie Ang

34
00:03:26,913 --> 00:03:27,833
and get her back.

35
00:03:28,753 --> 00:03:29,513
No, I won't.

36
00:03:29,873 --> 00:03:30,513
Why?

37
00:03:31,193 --> 00:03:32,073
I found

38
00:03:32,793 --> 00:03:34,593
that I am not good at this

39
00:03:36,153 --> 00:03:37,593
and I can't make her happy.

40
00:03:38,513 --> 00:03:40,513
It is better not to disturb her again.

41
00:03:53,633 --> 00:03:55,593
Why am I even bothering
to talk with you?

42
00:03:55,593 --> 00:03:56,633
You know nothing.

43
00:03:58,353 --> 00:03:59,553
Are you sure?

44
00:03:59,873 --> 00:04:01,113
Because you have never been
in a relationship.

45
00:04:05,593 --> 00:04:06,833
I smell a rat.

46
00:04:07,633 --> 00:04:08,553
Who is it?

47
00:04:09,353 --> 00:04:10,193
Do I know that person?

48
00:04:11,073 --> 00:04:11,633
Come on.

49
00:04:12,393 --> 00:04:12,873
Tell me.

50
00:04:12,873 --> 00:04:14,273
I shall help you.

51
00:04:17,353 --> 00:04:17,993
No need.

52
00:04:20,033 --> 00:04:21,313
Have you confessed your feelings?

53
00:04:23,233 --> 00:04:24,473
Liking someone

54
00:04:25,353 --> 00:04:26,313
is my own business.

55
00:04:27,993 --> 00:04:29,273
There is no need to let her know

56
00:04:30,233 --> 00:04:31,633
or be with her.

57
00:04:35,633 --> 00:04:36,673
It's like

58
00:04:37,033 --> 00:04:38,953
launching radio waves
to the boundless universe.

59
00:04:40,793 --> 00:04:42,153
Though you know it exists,

60
00:04:44,753 --> 00:04:46,793
you can never get the answer.

61
00:04:47,033 --> 00:04:47,913
You are sounding philosophical.

62
00:04:49,153 --> 00:04:49,913
Sophisticated.

63
00:04:50,233 --> 00:04:51,593

You need to eat now.

74
00:05:57,833 --> 00:05:58,473
Take a bite too.

75
00:05:59,313 --> 00:05:59,993
No.

76

Gao Yunlang.

78
00:06:15,313 --> 00:06:16,593
Your record shows

79
00:06:16,593 --> 00:06:18,233
that it reported an alert once

80
00:06:18,233 --> 00:06:19,513
around midnight yesterday.

81
00:06:20,193 --> 00:06:20,913
It must be wrong.

82
00:06:20,913 --> 00:06:22,233
I was sleeping at that time.

83
00:06:23,913 --> 00:06:24,873
What about Yueyue's?

84
00:06:26,553 --> 00:06:27,713
She will give it to you herself,
I guess.

85
00:06:28,633 --> 00:06:29,313
I'm off.

86
00:06:33,553 --> 00:06:35,193
Gao Yunlang is weird today.

87
00:06:38,633 --> 00:06:39,433
Lin Xi.

88
00:06:39,433 --> 00:06:39,873
Here you are.

89
00:06:39,873 --> 00:06:40,513
Mianmian.

90
00:06:41,993 --> 00:06:42,713
Thank you.

91
00:06:44,153 --> 00:06:44,953
Mianmian.

92
00:06:44,953 --> 00:06:46,913
Did you receive an alert once yesterday?

93
00:06:47,113 --> 00:06:48,113
What has happened?

94
00:06:48,673 --> 00:06:49,873
Probably it was short-circuiting.

95
00:06:50,113 --> 00:06:51,073
Do you think of

96
00:06:51,073 --> 00:06:51,953
making it waterproof?

97
00:06:54,913 --> 00:06:55,713
Xie Ang.

98
00:06:56,673 --> 00:06:57,113
You didn't sleep

99
00:06:57,113 --> 00:06:58,433
yesterday, did you?

100
00:06:59,393 --> 00:07:00,633
Can the smart band even tell this?

101
00:07:00,913 --> 00:07:02,433
I can tell from your terrible face

102
00:07:02,433 --> 00:07:03,753
that you didn't sleep well

103
00:07:03,753 --> 00:07:05,273
without checking the smart band.

104
00:07:06,313 --> 00:07:07,513
I'm going back to get some sleep.

105
00:07:10,353 --> 00:07:11,313
I'm leaving too.

106
00:07:12,513 --> 00:07:13,433
Bye-bye.

107
00:07:17,233 --> 00:07:20,513
The readings aren't accurate.

108
00:07:22,233 --> 00:07:23,473
Can the band be upgraded

109
00:07:23,473 --> 00:07:25,313
to version 4.0
before the contest?

110
00:07:26,913 --> 00:07:28,153
I don't think we have enough time.

(Jingzhou University Student
Start-up Competition Preliminaries)

112
00:07:48,833 --> 00:07:49,593
Candidate No. 70, Tang Xiaodong.

113
00:07:49,593 --> 00:07:50,233
Please get ready.

114
00:07:50,473 --> 00:07:51,073
Sure, sir.

115
00:07:51,073 --> 00:07:51,713
Thank you.

116
00:07:52,113 --> 00:07:52,713
You are here.

117
00:07:53,193 --> 00:07:54,353
Haven't they come out yet?

118
00:07:54,953 --> 00:07:56,313
It has been more than half an hour.

119
00:07:56,313 --> 00:07:57,633
The team that went in with them came out

120
00:07:57,633 --> 00:07:58,953
in less than ten minutes.

121
00:07:58,953 --> 00:08:00,193
It means they are in.

122
00:08:00,193 --> 00:08:00,953
Maybe the judges

123
00:08:00,953 --> 00:08:02,073
are interested in their projects

124
00:08:02,073 --> 00:08:03,033
and want to learn more about them.

125
00:08:03,273 --> 00:08:03,953
True though.

126
00:08:04,073 --> 00:08:05,633
Tang Xiaodong, you may come in now.

127
00:08:05,633 --> 00:08:06,073
Sure.

128
00:08:10,953 --> 00:08:11,553
Xie Ang.

129
00:08:11,793 --> 00:08:12,473
They are here.

130
00:08:15,153 --> 00:08:15,993
How is it?

131
00:08:16,633 --> 00:08:17,353
The judge said

132
00:08:17,353 --> 00:08:19,033
my plan is still insufficient

133
00:08:19,033 --> 00:08:20,193
and there are many details
that need to be revised.

134
00:08:20,513 --> 00:08:21,753
The data would need
to be populated as well.

135
00:08:23,913 --> 00:08:24,633
What about you?

136
00:08:25,913 --> 00:08:27,833
They praised that my plan was creative

137
00:08:27,833 --> 00:08:28,793
and new.

138
00:08:28,793 --> 00:08:29,393
If it gets to actualize,

139
00:08:29,393 --> 00:08:30,993
it will be a great help to all men.

140
00:08:30,993 --> 00:08:31,633
Besides,

141
00:08:31,633 --> 00:08:33,113
it will be greatly beneficial

142
00:08:33,113 --> 00:08:34,073
to human reproduction.

143
00:08:35,073 --> 00:08:36,313
So, have you passed?

144
00:08:40,033 --> 00:08:41,473
I will buy you a meal.

145
00:08:41,713 --> 00:08:42,633
I will eat with you the meal he buys.

146
00:08:43,593 --> 00:08:44,513
I see.

147
00:08:44,513 --> 00:08:44,953
Come on.

148
00:08:44,953 --> 00:08:45,673
Let's eat something delicious.

149
00:08:45,673 --> 00:08:45,993
Let's go.

150
00:08:45,993 --> 00:08:46,633
Come on.

151
00:08:47,233 --> 00:08:47,873
My plan

152
00:08:47,873 --> 00:08:49,033
is contributive to all human beings.

153
00:08:49,033 --> 00:08:50,233
Why didn't they approve of it?

154
00:08:50,233 --> 00:08:51,353
What else did the judges say?

155
00:08:51,353 --> 00:08:52,353
My plan was great

156
00:08:52,353 --> 00:08:53,393
and the judges were laughing.

157
00:08:53,393 --> 00:08:54,633
Why didn't they let it pass?

158
00:08:54,633 --> 00:08:56,433
They were laughing

159
00:08:56,433 --> 00:08:57,513
because of your stand-up show.

160
00:08:57,993 --> 00:08:58,873
It's true though.

161
00:08:59,713 --> 00:09:00,473
Ji Junxing.

162
00:09:00,873 --> 00:09:01,633
Lin Xi.

163

Professor Chen.

164
00:09:03,673 --> 00:09:04,513
What brings you here?

165
00:09:04,793 --> 00:09:05,673
They are my friends.

166
00:09:06,233 --> 00:09:07,033
- Good day, Professor Chen.
- Good day, Professor Chen.

167
00:09:07,033 --> 00:09:07,953
Hello.

168
00:09:08,513 --> 00:09:10,393
I came here to see

169
00:09:10,393 --> 00:09:11,633
if you let down my name.

170
00:09:12,713 --> 00:09:13,313
Good.

171
00:09:13,793 --> 00:09:14,713
Well done.

172
00:09:15,073 --> 00:09:16,633
I should thank you for guiding us.

173
00:09:16,953 --> 00:09:18,113
Don't be proud.

174
00:09:18,593 --> 00:09:20,393
Passing the primary selection
is just the first step.

175
00:09:20,913 --> 00:09:23,113
Next, you will encounter
a mid-term evaluation

176
00:09:23,113 --> 00:09:24,393
and the final round.

177
00:09:24,993 --> 00:09:26,593
To continue this path till the end,

178
00:09:27,553 --> 00:09:30,313
only the two of you aren't enough.

179
00:09:31,073 --> 00:09:32,473
You need a team

180
00:09:32,753 --> 00:09:34,113
of equally-skilled,

181
00:09:34,393 --> 00:09:35,233
and trustworthy members

182
00:09:35,553 --> 00:09:36,993
who work well together.

183
00:09:37,313 --> 00:09:38,033
Understood?

184
00:09:46,233 --> 00:09:46,913
Yes.

185
00:09:55,593 --> 00:09:57,433
First and foremost, thank you, everyone,

186
00:09:57,713 --> 00:09:59,393
especially Mr. Ji Junxing,

187
00:09:59,673 --> 00:10:00,753
for borrowing this room

188
00:10:00,753 --> 00:10:02,673
as our workspace.

189
00:10:02,673 --> 00:10:03,473
East Gate Squad,

190
00:10:03,473 --> 00:10:04,313
give him a round of applause.

191
00:10:07,633 --> 00:10:08,993
I got to borrow this room

192
00:10:08,993 --> 00:10:10,433
because the professor trusts us.

193
00:10:10,433 --> 00:10:11,713
It's not my credit,

194
00:10:11,713 --> 00:10:13,193
but all of us who made this work.

195
00:10:13,473 --> 00:10:13,873
Right.

196
00:10:14,113 --> 00:10:15,393
It's all of us who made this work.

197
00:10:17,360 --> 00:10:20,240
(Officially formed,
East Gate Start-up Squad)

198
00:10:20,473 --> 00:10:21,313
In 1975,

199
00:10:21,633 --> 00:10:22,673
Bill Gates and his friends

200
00:10:22,673 --> 00:10:24,153
created Microsoft in a motel room.

201
00:10:24,593 --> 00:10:25,633
In 1976,

202
00:10:25,633 --> 00:10:27,193
Jobs started Apple

203
00:10:27,193 --> 00:10:28,433
in a garage.

204
00:10:28,913 --> 00:10:31,833
While we, the East Gate Start-up Squad

205
00:10:31,833 --> 00:10:33,753
will be founded in this room.

206
00:10:33,753 --> 00:10:34,673
Well-said!

207
00:10:34,673 --> 00:10:36,833
- Yeah!
- Yeah!

208
00:10:40,713 --> 00:10:43,393
Who knows if the name
of the East Gate Squad

209
00:10:43,393 --> 00:10:45,153
will exist in Wikipedia one day?

210
00:10:45,673 --> 00:10:46,873
For this moment to arrive,

211
00:10:46,873 --> 00:10:48,593
let's get smashing.

212
00:10:48,593 --> 00:10:52,193
- Come on!
- Come on!

213
00:10:53,993 --> 00:10:55,393
That's all for the warm-up.

214
00:10:55,673 --> 00:10:56,353
Coming next,

215
00:10:56,353 --> 00:10:58,313
let's invite Mr. Ji Junxing
for a little talk.

216
00:10:58,913 --> 00:10:59,793
Come on, Ji Junxing.

217
00:11:01,593 --> 00:11:03,393
Thanks for the icebreaker.

218
00:11:03,713 --> 00:11:04,833
Let's not talk about grander goals.

219
00:11:05,153 --> 00:11:06,473
The next challenge we have to deal with

220
00:11:06,473 --> 00:11:07,273
is the mid-term evaluation.

221
00:11:07,833 --> 00:11:09,273
Now, we have 8,000 yuan

222
00:11:09,273 --> 00:11:10,513
as the start-up fund.

223
00:11:11,153 --> 00:11:12,353
We have several tasks on deck
at this moment.

224
00:11:12,753 --> 00:11:13,753
First,

225
00:11:14,033 --> 00:11:14,993
purchase similar smart bands

226
00:11:14,993 --> 00:11:16,193
for competitive product analysis.

227
00:11:16,873 --> 00:11:18,313
As for purchasing,
I'll do it.

228
00:11:18,313 --> 00:11:19,753
From now on,
I'm the Chief Finance Officer

229
00:11:19,753 --> 00:11:20,913
of the East Gate Squad.

230
00:11:20,913 --> 00:11:22,193
I will join Xie Ang

231
00:11:22,193 --> 00:11:23,913
to supervise him.

232
00:11:24,193 --> 00:11:25,793
You can work on human resourcing,

233
00:11:25,793 --> 00:11:27,513
like arranging the working period

234
00:11:27,513 --> 00:11:28,073
and coordinating the project's progress.

235
00:11:28,353 --> 00:11:28,873
Okay.

236
00:11:28,873 --> 00:11:29,953
I will make sure of it.

237
00:11:30,553 --> 00:11:31,593
Clap if you approve.

238
00:11:33,193 --> 00:11:33,793
Good.

239
00:11:34,153 --> 00:11:34,673
Also,

240
00:11:34,953 --> 00:11:36,033
when we are developing

241
00:11:36,033 --> 00:11:37,553
and upgrading the smart band,

242
00:11:37,553 --> 00:11:38,353
we need to do marketing research

243
00:11:38,353 --> 00:11:40,513
on the target audience.

244
00:11:40,833 --> 00:11:41,473
This task

245
00:11:41,473 --> 00:11:42,993
will be taken charge of
by Ji Junxing and me.

246
00:11:43,393 --> 00:11:44,433
What about us?

247
00:11:45,033 --> 00:11:45,913
The two of you

248
00:11:45,913 --> 00:11:46,393
are busy with experiments

249
00:11:46,393 --> 00:11:47,353
and internship.

250
00:11:47,353 --> 00:11:49,393
Therefore, you can

251
00:11:49,393 --> 00:11:50,353
use your free time

252
00:11:50,353 --> 00:11:51,473
to collect the information.

253
00:11:52,113 --> 00:11:52,993
- No problem.
- No problem.

254
00:11:52,993 --> 00:11:53,993
Clap if you approve.

255
00:11:58,113 --> 00:11:59,393
Fellow friends,

256
00:11:59,393 --> 00:12:00,393
CEO,

257
00:12:01,193 --> 00:12:02,993
COO,

258
00:12:04,513 --> 00:12:05,393
CTOs

259
00:12:05,673 --> 00:12:07,433
and CFOs,

260
00:12:07,833 --> 00:12:08,713
don't you think

261
00:12:08,713 --> 00:12:10,113
you are at the summit of success now?

262
00:12:10,393 --> 00:12:11,993
Let's raise the Coke

263
00:12:11,993 --> 00:12:14,073
for the success of our startup
in advance.

264
00:12:15,113 --> 00:12:16,273
- Yeah!
- Yeah!

265
00:12:16,273 --> 00:12:19,113
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

266
00:12:24,953 --> 00:12:25,913
Take the food out.

267
00:12:30,433 --> 00:12:32,273
I never expected the East Gate Squad

268
00:12:32,273 --> 00:12:33,833
will advance and become

269
00:12:33,833 --> 00:12:35,833
the East Gate Start-up Squad one day.

270
00:12:36,673 --> 00:12:37,633
Do you think

271
00:12:37,633 --> 00:12:38,673
how far we can reach?

272
00:12:38,673 --> 00:12:39,873
We will definitely make it to the end.

273
00:12:40,273 --> 00:12:42,113
But I heard that many start-up teams

274
00:12:42,113 --> 00:12:43,833
encounter all sorts of strife halfway

275
00:12:43,833 --> 00:12:44,513
and end up parting ways on bad terms.

276
00:12:44,713 --> 00:12:45,553
Will we encounter this too?

277
00:12:45,873 --> 00:12:47,273
- Shut up.
- Shut up.

278
00:12:47,900 --> 00:12:49,740
(Officially formed,
East Gate Start-up Squad)

279
00:12:50,713 --> 00:12:52,153
Can't you keep quiet while eating?

280
00:12:59,913 --> 00:13:00,753
Today's mission

281
00:13:00,753 --> 00:13:02,593
is to seek patients and their families

282
00:13:02,593 --> 00:13:03,833
at the Cardiothoracic surgery department

283
00:13:03,833 --> 00:13:05,273
to fill out 80 questionnaires

284
00:13:05,793 --> 00:13:07,233
in order to learn their needs
for the smart band.

285
00:13:07,753 --> 00:13:09,113
It's like distributing brochures.

286
00:13:09,113 --> 00:13:10,073
Easy-peasy.

287
00:13:14,220 --> 00:13:16,900
(Outpatient)

288
00:13:21,393 --> 00:13:23,313
How could you work as hospital scalpers

289
00:13:23,313 --> 00:13:24,273
at such a young age?

290
00:13:24,513 --> 00:13:24,993
Sir.

291
00:13:24,993 --> 00:13:25,833
We're not hospital scalpers.

292
00:13:25,833 --> 00:13:27,153
We are college students and
we are working on a survey

293
00:13:27,153 --> 00:13:28,313
for our start-up project.

294
00:13:29,393 --> 00:13:30,553
Which college are you from?

295
00:13:30,993 --> 00:13:31,873
Jinghua University.

296
00:13:32,313 --> 00:13:33,473
Jeez, I'm from Tsinghua University,
then.

297
00:13:33,833 --> 00:13:34,873
Show your student cards.

298
00:13:42,273 --> 00:13:43,113
I forget to bring it.

299
00:13:43,913 --> 00:13:46,353
Don't tell me you forget
to bring the identity card.

300
00:13:47,873 --> 00:13:49,113
I rushed out and
forgot to bring the card.

301
00:13:50,593 --> 00:13:51,393
What about this?

302
00:13:51,793 --> 00:13:52,913
You can have my phone.

303
00:13:52,913 --> 00:13:53,553
The questionnaires

304
00:13:53,553 --> 00:13:54,873
are very crucial to us.

305
00:13:55,233 --> 00:13:56,913
We will come back with the student cards
and exchange for it.

306
00:13:57,273 --> 00:13:58,673
Your excuse is just an old hat.

307
00:13:58,953 --> 00:14:00,513
You claimed it's a college project.

308
00:14:00,513 --> 00:14:02,753
In fact, you are stealing
patient information.

309
00:14:02,753 --> 00:14:03,793
Stay here.

310
00:14:04,233 --> 00:14:05,513
I will get the person in charge here.

311
00:14:05,513 --> 00:14:06,313
You talk to them.

312
00:14:06,313 --> 00:14:06,993
Don't.

313
00:14:06,993 --> 00:14:07,553
- Sir.
- Sir.

314
00:14:07,793 --> 00:14:09,353
We are students from Jinghua University.

315
00:14:12,073 --> 00:14:12,513
This...

316
00:14:12,513 --> 00:14:13,073
Sir.

317
00:14:13,073 --> 00:14:13,993
There is congestion outside.

318
00:14:14,393 --> 00:14:16,113
Perhaps you need to check it out first.

319
00:14:18,273 --> 00:14:19,473
Just stay here.

320
00:14:28,273 --> 00:14:29,073
Stand right there.

321
00:14:29,553 --> 00:14:30,433
Stand right there.

322
00:14:32,073 --> 00:14:32,593
Stand right there.

323
00:14:34,233 --> 00:14:34,953
Stand right there.

324
00:14:39,913 --> 00:14:40,673
Xie Ang.

325
00:14:43,233 --> 00:14:44,193
Why do you bring him here?

326
00:14:44,473 --> 00:14:45,753
He has joined our team.

327
00:14:46,913 --> 00:14:47,873
Let me introduce him to you.

328
00:14:48,153 --> 00:14:49,873
He is the non-staff aide
of the Purchase Team,

329
00:14:49,873 --> 00:14:51,473
He Qingyuan.

330
00:14:52,393 --> 00:14:53,153
He is Xie Ang.

331
00:14:53,153 --> 00:14:54,033
He is the financial director.

332
00:14:55,513 --> 00:14:56,553
And her boyfriend too.

333
00:14:59,353 --> 00:15:00,193
When did he join in?

334
00:15:00,473 --> 00:15:01,153
I didn't hear about this.

335
00:15:04,273 --> 00:15:05,393
Jiang Yimian told me

336
00:15:05,393 --> 00:15:06,553
about your start-up project

337
00:15:06,553 --> 00:15:07,233
and I'm interested in it.

338
00:15:07,593 --> 00:15:08,993
Besides, I agree with your concept

339
00:15:08,993 --> 00:15:10,393
after talking to Ji Junxing.

340
00:15:10,753 --> 00:15:12,033
Hence, I requested to aid you.

341
00:15:12,713 --> 00:15:14,873
Let's work together on this.

342
00:15:29,953 --> 00:15:30,833
Stop...

343
00:15:30,833 --> 00:15:31,593
Stop running.

344
00:15:33,033 --> 00:15:34,193
I think he has stopped chasing us.

345
00:15:34,713 --> 00:15:35,873
We should be safe now.

346
00:15:36,953 --> 00:15:37,673
Ji Junxing.

347
00:15:37,953 --> 00:15:39,593
We came for the survey though.

348
00:15:39,833 --> 00:15:41,713
Why are we running
like 800-meter racers?

349
00:15:42,513 --> 00:15:44,353
I don't think we need to run later.

350
00:15:44,753 --> 00:15:45,513
Touchwood!

351
00:15:46,313 --> 00:15:47,553
Don't jinx it.

352
00:15:48,953 --> 00:15:49,713
Touchwood.

353
00:15:56,153 --> 00:15:56,873
You must be hungry, right?

354
00:15:58,673 --> 00:15:59,673
I'm starving already.

355
00:16:02,033 --> 00:16:02,553
Come on.

356
00:16:03,033 --> 00:16:03,953
Let's eat something delicious.

357
00:16:06,673 --> 00:16:07,593
It smells so good.

358
00:16:10,353 --> 00:16:11,073
Let's buy this.

359
00:16:11,073 --> 00:16:11,753
It is equipped with full features

360
00:16:11,753 --> 00:16:12,593
and cheap.

361
00:16:14,033 --> 00:16:15,873
But, I think this one is better.

362
00:16:16,273 --> 00:16:16,953
The latest model,

363
00:16:17,193 --> 00:16:18,833
featured with the advanced
high-sensitivity sensor.

364
00:16:19,273 --> 00:16:20,673
About the latest model you are holding,

365
00:16:20,673 --> 00:16:21,433
the function of its sensor

366
00:16:21,433 --> 00:16:22,553
has merely been upgraded
by five percent,

367
00:16:22,553 --> 00:16:24,073
yet the price nearly doubled.

368
00:16:24,393 --> 00:16:26,153
Despite this, this model has more
valuable information we can look into.

369
00:16:26,153 --> 00:16:27,433
This is more cost-effective.

370
00:16:28,793 --> 00:16:29,673
- What do you think?
- What do you think?

371
00:16:30,753 --> 00:16:32,313
I think...

372
00:16:34,473 --> 00:16:36,393
Why don't we ask Ji Junxing?

373
00:16:36,393 --> 00:16:37,393
He will decide on this.

374
00:16:46,833 --> 00:16:48,193
Get the latest model.

375
00:16:49,353 --> 00:16:49,953
I know.

376
00:16:50,273 --> 00:16:51,353
But, we are benchmarking our product

377
00:16:51,353 --> 00:16:53,033
against the most advanced products
in the market.

378
00:16:54,873 --> 00:16:55,913
Table 23.

379
00:16:56,553 --> 00:16:57,713
Please pick up your order.

380
00:16:57,713 --> 00:16:58,273
Coming.

381
00:16:58,273 --> 00:16:58,833
I know.

382
00:16:59,393 --> 00:17:00,273
Just do as I said.

383
00:17:02,553 --> 00:17:03,753
Do keep your temper in check.

384
00:17:04,033 --> 00:17:04,513
Ma'am.

385
00:17:04,513 --> 00:17:05,953
I want two more buns
and one serving of fried dumplings.

386
00:17:05,953 --> 00:17:06,593
Sure.

387
00:17:07,393 --> 00:17:08,313
Thank you.

388
00:17:09,513 --> 00:17:10,433
All right.

389
00:17:13,113 --> 00:17:13,673
Okay.

390
00:17:13,993 --> 00:17:14,553
Well.

391
00:17:14,553 --> 00:17:14,993
Sure.

392
00:17:22,993 --> 00:17:23,713
Give me a second.

393
00:17:23,713 --> 00:17:24,353
Hold it from below.

394
00:17:25,153 --> 00:17:25,993
I will take this.

395
00:17:29,873 --> 00:17:30,553
Let's go.

396
00:17:31,473 --> 00:17:32,473
Are you done with the call?

397
00:17:32,633 --> 00:17:33,713
What has happened?

398
00:17:34,513 --> 00:17:35,673
They almost fought

399
00:17:35,673 --> 00:17:36,713
because of the price difference.

400
00:17:37,953 --> 00:17:39,113
I saw this coming.

401
00:17:39,113 --> 00:17:40,353
We can only blame the financial director

402
00:17:40,353 --> 00:17:41,273
for doing his job too well.

403
00:17:43,713 --> 00:17:45,633
Finally, I get to eat something hot.

404
00:17:51,153 --> 00:17:52,153
Eat slowly.

405
00:17:52,513 --> 00:17:53,713
No one is taking the food away from you.

406
00:17:53,713 --> 00:17:54,513
They are all yours.

407
00:17:57,873 --> 00:17:58,793
Silly girl.

408
00:18:01,193 --> 00:18:01,913
Feeling better now?

409
00:18:08,233 --> 00:18:09,073
I only get to eat something hot

410
00:18:09,073 --> 00:18:10,633
after working the whole morning.

411
00:18:10,953 --> 00:18:12,073
How tough my life is.

412
00:18:23,793 --> 00:18:24,393
What is wrong?

413
00:18:25,953 --> 00:18:27,153
Where are the questionnaires?

414
00:18:28,793 --> 00:18:30,033
Did you put them on the table just now?

415
00:18:46,873 --> 00:18:47,513
Ma'am.

416
00:18:47,513 --> 00:18:49,113
Did you see a pile of A4 papers
just now?

417
00:18:49,313 --> 00:18:50,313
Which table is it?

418
00:18:50,313 --> 00:18:51,393
The first table at the entrance.

419
00:18:52,313 --> 00:18:53,793
That was yours?

420
00:18:53,793 --> 00:18:55,033
It's something important.

421
00:18:55,313 --> 00:18:55,873
I'm sorry.

422
00:18:55,873 --> 00:18:57,113
I thought someone left it there

423
00:18:57,113 --> 00:18:57,433
as trash.

424
00:18:57,433 --> 00:18:58,833
Hence, I threw it away.

425
00:18:59,073 --> 00:18:59,873
You threw it away?

426
00:19:00,793 --> 00:19:01,633
Where did you put it?

427
00:19:01,953 --> 00:19:03,833
The rubbish truck just collected
the trash.

428
00:19:06,873 --> 00:19:08,113
I'm so sorry.

429
00:19:09,713 --> 00:19:11,153
Hold up, sir.

430
00:19:11,233 --> 00:19:12,233
Sir.

431
00:19:13,953 --> 00:19:17,313
Sir, please stop the truck.

432
00:19:17,553 --> 00:19:21,553
♪Keeping the vast ocean in my chest♪

433
00:19:21,553 --> 00:19:22,713
Sir.

434
00:19:25,673 --> 00:19:26,633
Sir.

435
00:19:26,873 --> 00:19:27,713
Sorry.

436
00:19:27,713 --> 00:19:28,233
650 yuan, right?

437
00:19:28,233 --> 00:19:29,153
Sorry for taking up
so long of your time.

438
00:19:29,193 --> 00:19:29,833
It's fine.

439
00:19:30,273 --> 00:19:31,553
Since I promised to help out,

440
00:19:31,553 --> 00:19:32,313
I will do my best.

441
00:19:32,313 --> 00:19:32,833
True, though.

442
00:19:32,833 --> 00:19:34,273
We do save a lot of money.

443
00:19:36,113 --> 00:19:37,073
It's done.

444
00:19:37,673 --> 00:19:38,353
Let's go.

445
00:19:40,473 --> 00:19:41,793
We went to so many stores this afternoon

446
00:19:41,793 --> 00:19:43,153
just to save one hundred or two yuan.

447
00:19:43,153 --> 00:19:44,713
My legs are sore now.

448
00:19:44,713 --> 00:19:46,153
I would rather make up the difference
with my own money.

449
00:19:46,513 --> 00:19:47,313
We are doing

450
00:19:47,313 --> 00:19:48,673
competitive product analysis now.

451
00:19:48,673 --> 00:19:50,553
We are saving money
for the start-up fund.

452
00:19:51,153 --> 00:19:52,233
Well, then I will use my money

453
00:19:52,233 --> 00:19:53,313
to buy coffee

454
00:19:53,313 --> 00:19:55,033
and take a rest at the coffee shop.
Is that okay?

455
00:19:55,033 --> 00:19:56,833
I'm so tired and I can't stand
on my feet anymore.

456
00:19:58,313 --> 00:19:59,273
What do you like to drink?

457
00:19:59,633 --> 00:20:00,113
It's on me.

458
00:20:00,433 --> 00:20:01,113
No need.

459
00:20:01,113 --> 00:20:02,073
It is late now.

460
00:20:02,233 --> 00:20:03,313
We shall go back now.

461
00:20:04,113 --> 00:20:05,993
See you next time.

462
00:20:06,513 --> 00:20:06,913
All right.

463
00:20:06,913 --> 00:20:08,073
Bye-bye.

464
00:20:13,193 --> 00:20:14,273
See you next time?

465
00:20:14,273 --> 00:20:15,313
Why are you seeing him again?

466
00:20:17,073 --> 00:20:18,153
What has gotten into you?

467
00:20:18,153 --> 00:20:19,913
You have been giving him the side-eye.

468
00:20:23,153 --> 00:20:24,433
Do you think I'm an entertainer

469
00:20:24,873 --> 00:20:26,233
who smiles at everyone?

470
00:20:26,873 --> 00:20:28,073
Can't I be unhappy?

471
00:20:28,073 --> 00:20:28,953
Can't I be mad?

472
00:20:28,953 --> 00:20:30,233
Can't I put a long face?

473
00:20:30,233 --> 00:20:30,833
Yes, you can.

474
00:20:30,833 --> 00:20:31,793
You are at liberty to do so.

475
00:20:31,793 --> 00:20:33,193
Do throw your tantrum alone.

476
00:20:33,193 --> 00:20:33,793
Goodbye.

477
00:20:35,433 --> 00:20:36,353
Don't you want coffee?

478
00:20:36,713 --> 00:20:37,393
I'm pissed off now.

479
00:20:37,393 --> 00:20:38,233
You go yourself.

480
00:20:50,913 --> 00:20:52,073
Thank you, mister.

481
00:20:52,273 --> 00:20:52,993
Thank you so much.

482
00:20:53,073 --> 00:20:53,713
I'm not old though.

483
00:20:54,113 --> 00:20:54,873
Thank you so much, dude.

484
00:20:55,633 --> 00:20:56,553
You are more sensible.

485
00:20:58,553 --> 00:20:59,993
Don't leave behind important things
again.

486
00:21:00,353 --> 00:21:01,313
Sure.

487
00:21:03,513 --> 00:21:05,313
That 800-meters running just now

488
00:21:05,433 --> 00:21:06,273
seemed to be a warm-up.

489
00:21:06,593 --> 00:21:08,193
We just finished 1,500 meters

490
00:21:08,593 --> 00:21:09,553
which is the main part.

491
00:21:10,593 --> 00:21:12,313
I told you not to jinx it.

492
00:21:12,593 --> 00:21:13,353
Look what has happened.

493
00:21:13,353 --> 00:21:14,473
I've never expected to see this coming
so soon.

494
00:21:19,473 --> 00:21:20,353
Why is our start-up

495
00:21:20,353 --> 00:21:21,673
so much different from
what I used to imagine?

496
00:21:22,313 --> 00:21:23,353
I thought we should

497
00:21:23,353 --> 00:21:24,353
lie comfortably in a well-furnished
and spacious office

498
00:21:24,353 --> 00:21:25,913
in the central business district,

499
00:21:25,913 --> 00:21:26,953
drinking coffee

500
00:21:26,953 --> 00:21:29,153
and dealing with big projects
worth tens of millions of investment.

501
00:21:29,153 --> 00:21:30,833
Or at least we can sit
in the air-conditioned room

502
00:21:30,833 --> 00:21:31,873
and eat some snacks.

503
00:21:33,833 --> 00:21:34,913
Why were we

504
00:21:35,193 --> 00:21:37,073
chasing the rubbish truck
and looking for the trash?

505
00:21:38,033 --> 00:21:39,033
I can't get through this.

506
00:21:40,393 --> 00:21:41,233
Why?

507
00:21:42,153 --> 00:21:43,633
Do you regret starting up a business
with me?

508
00:21:43,913 --> 00:21:44,633
Yes.

509
00:21:44,953 --> 00:21:46,033
I truly regret it.

510
00:21:46,513 --> 00:21:47,513
I have been busy this whole day

511
00:21:47,513 --> 00:21:48,513
and only got to take one bite
of the fried dumpling.

512
00:21:48,513 --> 00:21:50,233
Yet it burnt my mouth.

513
00:21:53,513 --> 00:21:54,193
No way.

514
00:21:54,313 --> 00:21:56,233
You must compensate me.

515
00:21:57,393 --> 00:21:58,073
Sure.

516
00:22:02,513 --> 00:22:03,633
Let me think.

517
00:22:08,393 --> 00:22:09,793
I want bubble tea.

518
00:22:10,593 --> 00:22:11,513
Bubble tea?

519
00:22:13,793 --> 00:22:15,073
Ask me what flavor I want.

520
00:22:16,073 --> 00:22:16,713
What flavor do you want?

521
00:22:17,073 --> 00:22:19,593
I want the latest flavor with yam paste.

522
00:22:20,833 --> 00:22:22,273
You don't know about my palate.

523
00:22:22,273 --> 00:22:23,633
I know.

524
00:22:24,033 --> 00:22:25,393
You want bubble tea
with all kinds of add-ups,

525
00:22:25,393 --> 00:22:26,833
like pearl, jelly

526
00:22:26,833 --> 00:22:27,953
and everything.

527
00:22:40,233 --> 00:22:40,913
Hello.

528
00:22:41,740 --> 00:22:43,140
(I'm downstairs.)

529
00:22:44,033 --> 00:22:45,233
Sure, I would be there right away.

530
00:22:53,513 --> 00:22:54,273
You washed your hair.

531
00:22:55,993 --> 00:22:56,993
You smell good.

532
00:22:57,273 --> 00:22:58,353
Finally, my squeaky-clean boyfriend

533
00:22:58,353 --> 00:22:59,433
is back.

534
00:23:00,073 --> 00:23:01,473
My roommate thought
I was collecting durians

535
00:23:01,473 --> 00:23:02,393
in Thailand.

536
00:23:02,633 --> 00:23:03,753
Me too.

537
00:23:04,073 --> 00:23:05,993
Luckily, we are clean now.

538
00:23:07,073 --> 00:23:08,113
Why do you come here

539
00:23:08,113 --> 00:23:08,793
late at night?

540
00:23:09,433 --> 00:23:10,793
I'm afraid you plan to leave.

541
00:23:10,793 --> 00:23:12,553
So I went to buy the same fried dumpling
you had this morning

542
00:23:12,553 --> 00:23:13,513
to buy you off.

543
00:23:14,273 --> 00:23:15,673
Wow!

544
00:23:17,033 --> 00:23:18,793
You just come at the right time.

545
00:23:18,793 --> 00:23:19,273
Come on.

546
00:23:20,193 --> 00:23:20,953
Taste it.

547
00:23:27,073 --> 00:23:28,073
Yummy.

548
00:23:29,313 --> 00:23:30,273
This is delicious.

549
00:23:30,713 --> 00:23:32,113
Are you still resigning?

550
00:23:34,433 --> 00:23:36,233
Are you buying me off with
one bite of the fried dumpling?

551
00:23:36,673 --> 00:23:37,353
It seems my effort

552
00:23:37,353 --> 00:23:38,793
is only paid with chicken feed.

553
00:23:39,993 --> 00:23:41,753
You can take some more bites.

554
00:23:42,793 --> 00:23:43,833
I will consider it.

555
00:23:52,553 --> 00:23:53,993
This is yummy.

556
00:24:06,033 --> 00:24:07,113
We only have less than two weeks

557
00:24:07,113 --> 00:24:08,353
for the mid-term presentation.

558
00:24:08,633 --> 00:24:10,113
(Monthly Summary)
Also, one part of the business proposal

559
00:24:10,113 --> 00:24:11,433
(Monthly Summary)
is left undone.

560
00:24:12,153 --> 00:24:13,113
You may report

561
00:24:13,113 --> 00:24:14,593
your progress

562
00:24:14,593 --> 00:24:15,713
and the problems you encountered.

563
00:24:16,713 --> 00:24:17,673
I have nothing much to say.

564
00:24:18,233 --> 00:24:19,673
Look at all those smart bands
and receipts.

565
00:24:20,033 --> 00:24:21,153
I saved some money

566
00:24:21,473 --> 00:24:22,553
while buying the best product
you requested

567
00:24:22,553 --> 00:24:23,273
yet I was accused of being stingy.

568
00:24:23,913 --> 00:24:24,953
When I bought cheap products,

569
00:24:24,953 --> 00:24:25,833
I was told of not being insightful.

570
00:24:26,033 --> 00:24:27,273
It's out of my depth to deal
with the financial director's job.

571
00:24:28,473 --> 00:24:30,353
Are you hinting at me
that I've spent much?

572
00:24:30,673 --> 00:24:31,953
We eat instant noodles every day

573
00:24:31,953 --> 00:24:33,193
and sit in this room
without air conditioner,

574
00:24:33,193 --> 00:24:33,993
yet the money ran out.

575
00:24:33,993 --> 00:24:34,713
I'm truly curious about

576
00:24:34,713 --> 00:24:35,473
what you have done,

577
00:24:35,473 --> 00:24:36,673
Financial director?

578
00:24:36,673 --> 00:24:37,873
I don't think you eat instant noodles
every day.

579
00:24:38,033 --> 00:24:39,593
Didn't He Qingyuan ask you out
for coffee?

580
00:24:39,753 --> 00:24:40,553
Why do you always find fault with us

581
00:24:40,553 --> 00:24:41,193
out of no reason?

582
00:24:41,193 --> 00:24:41,953
What the heck do you mean?

583
00:24:41,953 --> 00:24:42,913
What do you think?

584
00:24:42,913 --> 00:24:43,353
You...

585
00:24:43,353 --> 00:24:43,713
Enough said.

586
00:24:43,713 --> 00:24:44,593
I will interject here.

587
00:24:44,913 --> 00:24:46,073
Can we get back to our business?

588
00:24:46,593 --> 00:24:47,953
I need to leave for the lecture later.

589
00:24:49,633 --> 00:24:50,593
Well,

590
00:24:50,593 --> 00:24:51,753
I'm quite occupied

591
00:24:52,233 --> 00:24:53,833
with the thesis assigned
by my professor.

592
00:24:54,633 --> 00:24:55,433
As for Gao Yunlang,

593
00:24:55,433 --> 00:24:56,433
he is busy with the internship.

594
00:24:57,153 --> 00:24:57,873
Hence, around one-third

595
00:24:57,873 --> 00:24:59,433
of the information

596
00:24:59,633 --> 00:25:00,633
on medical artificial intelligence

597
00:25:00,633 --> 00:25:01,513
hasn't been sorted out yet.

598
00:25:02,753 --> 00:25:03,793
Please give us two more weeks.

599
00:25:04,073 --> 00:25:05,313
We promise to accomplish it.

600
00:25:06,193 --> 00:25:06,753
Sure.

601
00:25:07,113 --> 00:25:08,033
Understood.

602
00:25:08,993 --> 00:25:09,993
We shall take our leave then.

603
00:25:11,913 --> 00:25:12,633
I have nothing

604
00:25:12,633 --> 00:25:13,793
to say to someone.

605
00:25:13,793 --> 00:25:14,473
You may continue.

606
00:25:14,473 --> 00:25:15,313
I will get going now.

607
00:25:15,553 --> 00:25:16,313
You don't have to leave.

608
00:25:16,553 --> 00:25:17,353
I will.

609
00:25:31,473 --> 00:25:32,913
Everything we are encountering now

610
00:25:32,913 --> 00:25:34,513
is what Jobs and his team faced before.

611
00:25:36,553 --> 00:25:37,513
It sounds like difficulty

612
00:25:37,913 --> 00:25:39,153
isn't necessarily a bad thing.

613
00:26:02,833 --> 00:26:03,913
Sure.

614
00:26:07,153 --> 00:26:07,953
Tastes good.

615
00:26:07,953 --> 00:26:09,473
Did you buy me this from Australia?

616
00:26:09,913 --> 00:26:10,873
You even missed me terribly

617
00:26:10,873 --> 00:26:11,913
when you were on the other side
of the earth.

618
00:26:12,153 --> 00:26:13,793
I'm so touched, Kai.

619
00:26:13,793 --> 00:26:15,153
Don't overthink.

620
00:26:15,153 --> 00:26:16,633
I simply bought it from the airport.

621
00:26:16,633 --> 00:26:17,633
Eat it yourself.

622
00:26:19,353 --> 00:26:20,553
I was about to praise you.

623
00:26:22,433 --> 00:26:24,113
You left for Australia for some time.

624
00:26:24,553 --> 00:26:26,353
Did you salvage the situation
with your dad?

625
00:26:27,513 --> 00:26:28,673
Not at all.

626
00:26:28,673 --> 00:26:30,073
I won't make up with him this lifetime.

627
00:26:33,313 --> 00:26:34,873
You have been avoiding Lin Xi
for some time.

628
00:26:34,873 --> 00:26:36,153
Have you gotten over it?

629
00:26:36,633 --> 00:26:37,553
Nonsense.

630
00:26:38,193 --> 00:26:41,873
I just went traveling and relaxing.

631
00:26:42,673 --> 00:26:43,473
Fine.

632
00:26:43,473 --> 00:26:44,673
Let's say you went traveling.

633
00:26:44,673 --> 00:26:45,593
How is it?

634
00:26:45,593 --> 00:26:47,073
Did you get enlightened
from the journey?

635
00:26:57,113 --> 00:26:58,433
Your exhibition will be held this week,
right?

636
00:26:58,433 --> 00:26:58,913
Yes.

637
00:26:58,913 --> 00:26:59,513
Why?

638
00:27:03,473 --> 00:27:04,153
Do me a favor.

639
00:27:07,193 --> 00:27:07,593
Sure.

640
00:27:07,593 --> 00:27:08,233
Of course.

641
00:27:11,700 --> 00:27:13,980
(National Track and Field
Championship Champion)

642
00:27:20,593 --> 00:27:21,633
Black Bull.

643
00:27:21,633 --> 00:27:22,913
Why do you look for me?

644
00:27:25,833 --> 00:27:27,593
Sha Baitian Solo Photography Exhibition.

645
00:27:27,873 --> 00:27:28,873
You are having your own exhibition?

646
00:27:28,873 --> 00:27:30,273
Well done, Black Bull.

647
00:27:30,833 --> 00:27:31,633
Don't mention it.

648
00:27:31,633 --> 00:27:33,273
It's just the semester-end
assignment presentation.

649
00:27:33,273 --> 00:27:33,873
Would you come?

650
00:27:33,873 --> 00:27:35,073
It's 7PM tonight.

651
00:27:35,073 --> 00:27:36,233
Do you have time?

652
00:27:36,233 --> 00:27:37,033
Of course, I will.

653
00:27:37,513 --> 00:27:38,673
Can I invite some of my friends?

654
00:27:38,953 --> 00:27:39,673
Sure.

655
00:27:39,913 --> 00:27:40,713
Bring as many as you can.

656
00:27:41,153 --> 00:27:43,353
I was worried no one would come.

657
00:27:43,353 --> 00:27:44,673
I will invite them then.

658
00:27:48,313 --> 00:27:50,313
Let's chill out

659
00:27:50,633 --> 00:27:51,833
and go to an exhibition tonight.

660
00:27:51,833 --> 00:27:53,553
Plus, we can relieve the atmosphere.

661
00:27:53,793 --> 00:27:55,233
I will send the time and venue
to the group chat.

662
00:27:57,393 --> 00:27:58,113
Lin Xi.

663
00:27:58,393 --> 00:28:00,313
Did you invite Ji Junxing
and the rest too?

664
00:28:01,073 --> 00:28:01,753
Yes. I invited them.

665
00:28:02,673 --> 00:28:03,393
All right.

666
00:28:12,980 --> 00:28:16,540
(Photographic Exhibition)

667
00:28:40,313 --> 00:28:41,793
It's impolite to do so.

668
00:28:41,793 --> 00:28:42,873
I'm so sorry.

669
00:28:47,073 --> 00:28:47,913
Kai.

670
00:28:49,793 --> 00:28:50,913
There is something

671
00:28:51,313 --> 00:28:52,713
I need to tell you.

672
00:28:52,713 --> 00:28:53,953
What do you think of my plan?

673
00:28:55,113 --> 00:28:56,033
What plan is it?

674
00:28:56,753 --> 00:28:57,873
Later when Lin Xi comes in

675
00:28:57,873 --> 00:28:58,953
and gets surprised
after seeing that all photos

676
00:28:58,953 --> 00:29:00,273
are about me,

677
00:29:00,513 --> 00:29:01,993
I will take out the gold medal

678
00:29:03,153 --> 00:29:03,953
and put it around her neck.

679
00:29:05,193 --> 00:29:06,513
Then, I will tell her

680
00:29:06,513 --> 00:29:08,353
that I have never forgotten
my promise to her.

681
00:29:08,673 --> 00:29:09,433
How is it?

682
00:29:09,433 --> 00:29:10,193
Are you moved?

683
00:29:11,713 --> 00:29:12,393
No, I daren't move.

684
00:29:12,713 --> 00:29:14,713
I feel I had a ton hanging at my neck.

685
00:29:16,033 --> 00:29:17,953
This is a gold medal of
a national competition.

686
00:29:18,633 --> 00:29:19,913
The gold is heavy for sure.

687
00:29:20,153 --> 00:29:21,273
Now, there is only one missing piece

688
00:29:21,273 --> 00:29:22,433
of the puzzle and that is Lin Xi.

689
00:29:23,513 --> 00:29:24,713
Wait, Kai.

690
00:29:24,713 --> 00:29:25,433
Later...

691
00:29:25,433 --> 00:29:26,273
Leave now.

692
00:29:40,473 --> 00:29:41,353
Ji Junxing.

693
00:29:50,793 --> 00:29:51,593
Sorry.

694
00:29:51,593 --> 00:29:52,753
But she has to go with me this time.

695
00:29:54,913 --> 00:29:55,393
Lin Xi.

696
00:29:55,393 --> 00:29:56,393
Qin Kai.

697
00:29:56,753 --> 00:29:57,593
What are you doing?

698
00:29:57,593 --> 00:29:58,473
Long time no see.

699
00:29:59,273 --> 00:30:00,593
When did you come back?

700
00:30:02,433 --> 00:30:03,913
Where are you taking me?

701
00:30:03,940 --> 00:30:07,500
(Photographic Exhibition)

702
00:30:28,673 --> 00:30:29,433
Tell me.

703
00:30:30,273 --> 00:30:31,713
Where have you gone previously?

704
00:30:31,713 --> 00:30:32,633
You just went missing

705
00:30:32,633 --> 00:30:33,553
without leaving a message.

706
00:30:33,833 --> 00:30:35,993
I went to many places

707
00:30:36,513 --> 00:30:37,993
sparing myself

708
00:30:37,993 --> 00:30:39,273
a long vacation.

709
00:30:40,593 --> 00:30:41,513
Well,

710
00:30:41,513 --> 00:30:42,713
share with me

711
00:30:42,713 --> 00:30:44,233
those great places you visited.

712
00:30:46,753 --> 00:30:50,753
In China, I went to Xinjiang and experienced
the desert,

713
00:30:51,473 --> 00:30:54,353
then bungee jumping at Macau Tower.

714
00:30:55,033 --> 00:30:57,593
Afterwards, I went skiing in Serbia

715
00:30:57,873 --> 00:30:59,433
for half a month

716
00:30:59,433 --> 00:31:00,913
and I almost had snow blindness.

717
00:31:01,513 --> 00:31:02,433
After that,

718
00:31:02,433 --> 00:31:05,033
my father forced me back to Australia.

719
00:31:05,033 --> 00:31:08,273
Hence, I was watching animals and plants

720
00:31:10,273 --> 00:31:11,313
and went diving every day.

721
00:31:11,713 --> 00:31:13,153
Jeez, brat.

722
00:31:13,153 --> 00:31:14,633
You had a great time.

723
00:31:14,633 --> 00:31:15,353
What happened next?

724
00:31:16,033 --> 00:31:19,273
I went diving few days ago.

725
00:31:19,593 --> 00:31:21,353
My leg was entangled in kelp

726
00:31:21,833 --> 00:31:22,993
and I was nearly

727
00:31:23,953 --> 00:31:25,313
drowned in the sea.

728
00:31:27,793 --> 00:31:29,393
Luckily, those who went diving with me
found me

729
00:31:30,153 --> 00:31:31,273
and saved my life.

730
00:31:31,633 --> 00:31:33,073
It sounds dangerous.

731
00:31:34,033 --> 00:31:34,953
Yes, it was.

732
00:31:39,513 --> 00:31:40,193
Lin Xi.

733
00:31:41,793 --> 00:31:43,313
The moment

734
00:31:43,313 --> 00:31:44,633
when I was on the verge of death,

735
00:31:45,953 --> 00:31:47,433
your image

736
00:31:47,433 --> 00:31:48,833
filled my mind.

737
00:31:52,113 --> 00:31:53,113
I thought

738
00:31:54,473 --> 00:31:56,673
of my unfulfilled promise to you,

739
00:31:57,433 --> 00:31:58,593
and

740
00:31:58,993 --> 00:32:01,193
I thought of spending my birthday
with you every year.

741
00:32:02,593 --> 00:32:03,473
Also,

742
00:32:03,473 --> 00:32:05,313
I haven't bid you goodbye properly.

743
00:32:06,593 --> 00:32:07,553
Anyway,

744
00:32:08,473 --> 00:32:10,073
they were all about you.

745
00:32:12,753 --> 00:32:14,153
At that time,

746
00:32:16,313 --> 00:32:18,513
I felt that if I died there,

747
00:32:19,593 --> 00:32:20,993
I would be living my life

748
00:32:21,953 --> 00:32:23,633
for nothing.

749
00:32:25,353 --> 00:32:26,233
So, after I got onshore,

750
00:32:26,233 --> 00:32:27,633
I bought the ticket to fly back here

751
00:32:29,073 --> 00:32:30,073
and meet with you.

752
00:32:32,993 --> 00:32:33,633
Here.

753
00:32:35,393 --> 00:32:36,473
The gold medal arrived late.

754
00:32:37,113 --> 00:32:37,833
This is for you.

755
00:32:46,873 --> 00:32:48,513
National track and field champion.

756
00:32:48,833 --> 00:32:50,193
You won the national prize?

757
00:32:53,353 --> 00:32:53,953
All right.

758
00:32:54,873 --> 00:32:56,873
On behalf of Lin Xin
from four years ago,

759
00:32:56,873 --> 00:32:58,873
I would like to offer my congratulation
to Qin Kai

760
00:32:59,193 --> 00:32:59,993
from four years ago too.

761
00:33:00,793 --> 00:33:02,553
Though it's late,

762
00:33:02,993 --> 00:33:04,473
you won

763
00:33:04,633 --> 00:33:05,793
your own gold medal.

764
00:33:05,913 --> 00:33:07,473
You are amazing.

765
00:33:10,833 --> 00:33:12,193
To not leave any regrets,

766
00:33:13,153 --> 00:33:14,953
I would like to give
the last shot this time.

767
00:33:16,193 --> 00:33:17,073
What's it?

768
00:33:19,593 --> 00:33:20,393
Lin Xi.

769
00:33:21,473 --> 00:33:22,753
I like you.

770
00:33:23,553 --> 00:33:25,313
I have liked you for a really long time.

771
00:33:26,633 --> 00:33:29,273
We have gone through a lot

772
00:33:30,673 --> 00:33:32,273
and gotten into trouble together.

773
00:33:34,273 --> 00:33:35,073
Lin Xi.

774
00:33:37,073 --> 00:33:40,593
Did you ever fall in love with me

775
00:33:42,513 --> 00:33:43,993
even just once

776
00:33:46,793 --> 00:33:47,953
or for a moment?

777
00:33:58,153 --> 00:33:59,193
Do you still remember

778
00:33:59,553 --> 00:34:01,273
the Monilaria moniliformis you gave me?

779
00:34:05,513 --> 00:34:07,513
I like them very much.

780
00:34:08,873 --> 00:34:10,073
Throughout the entire summer,

781
00:34:10,273 --> 00:34:12,793
I watered it with great care.

782
00:34:14,113 --> 00:34:15,233
I feared the roots would be soaked

783
00:34:16,073 --> 00:34:17,713
if the water was too much.

784
00:34:18,753 --> 00:34:19,953
I feared it would wilt

785
00:34:20,593 --> 00:34:21,993
if the water was too less.

786
00:34:25,713 --> 00:34:27,793
Still, the plant wilted day by day.

787
00:34:30,313 --> 00:34:31,673
However, when autumn came

788
00:34:32,593 --> 00:34:33,793
and the temperature turned cooler,

789
00:34:35,433 --> 00:34:36,433
the plant recovered

790
00:34:36,433 --> 00:34:37,633
to the way it used to be,

791
00:34:39,513 --> 00:34:41,193
growing vigorously.

792
00:34:43,433 --> 00:34:44,353
Qin Kai.

793
00:34:46,033 --> 00:34:47,993
I think the feeling of liking someone

794
00:34:49,353 --> 00:34:51,313
is similar to the plant and me.

795
00:34:52,633 --> 00:34:54,553
You can't expect a response from it.

796
00:34:55,673 --> 00:34:57,473
However, it would never forget

797
00:34:59,313 --> 00:35:01,153
the way you protected it.

798
00:35:08,153 --> 00:35:09,553
I would always remember

799
00:35:11,193 --> 00:35:12,833
at the age of eighteen,

800
00:35:13,633 --> 00:35:15,193
the best age of mine,

801
00:35:16,553 --> 00:35:18,313
there is a boy

802
00:35:19,393 --> 00:35:20,793
who likes me

803
00:35:22,113 --> 00:35:24,513
for a long time sincerely.

804
00:35:27,913 --> 00:35:29,233
His liking for me

805
00:35:30,673 --> 00:35:34,553
has gilded a common girl like me

806
00:35:35,833 --> 00:35:38,073
with an iridescent glow.

807
00:35:41,873 --> 00:35:42,873
Therefore,

808
00:35:43,793 --> 00:35:45,233
when I recall it

809
00:35:45,993 --> 00:35:47,673
many years later,

810
00:35:48,673 --> 00:35:49,873
I believe

811
00:35:51,273 --> 00:35:52,633
the time we had together

812
00:35:53,793 --> 00:35:55,193
is pure

813
00:35:56,633 --> 00:35:57,913
and beautiful.

814
00:36:01,593 --> 00:36:02,433
Qin Kai.

815
00:36:04,633 --> 00:36:05,513
Thank you.

816
00:36:11,073 --> 00:36:11,873
Enough.

817
00:36:12,673 --> 00:36:14,713
I think you are going to take a bow
and say sorry.

818
00:36:15,473 --> 00:36:16,753
We are good friends.

819
00:36:17,113 --> 00:36:18,113
Don't be so courteous.

820
00:36:19,113 --> 00:36:19,593
Nothing can't be solved

821
00:36:19,593 --> 00:36:21,353
with a hotpot meal.

822
00:36:21,913 --> 00:36:23,233
Remember to treat me to a hotpot.

823
00:36:25,553 --> 00:36:26,273
