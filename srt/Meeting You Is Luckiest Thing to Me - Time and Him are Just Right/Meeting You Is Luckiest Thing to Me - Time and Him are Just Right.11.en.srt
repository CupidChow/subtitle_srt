=Episode 11=

17
00:01:53,244 --> 00:01:54,564
I should just turn around

18
00:01:54,564 --> 00:01:55,684
and let you look at my back.

19
00:01:56,044 --> 00:01:56,884
It's not necessary.

20
00:01:56,884 --> 00:01:58,244
I was too excited.

21
00:01:58,244 --> 00:02:01,004
We finally met each other in real life.

22
00:02:01,964 --> 00:02:04,484
You look more lovely
than you were in the video.

23
00:02:04,484 --> 00:02:06,164
Do not use the word "lovely"

24
00:02:06,164 --> 00:02:06,684
to describe me.

25
00:02:06,684 --> 00:02:07,404
After all,

26
00:02:07,404 --> 00:02:08,724
my age is in double digits.

27
00:02:10,244 --> 00:02:11,004
So is mine.

28
00:02:11,324 --> 00:02:12,844
Then, we're about the same age.

29
00:02:12,844 --> 00:02:13,484
Besides,

30
00:02:13,484 --> 00:02:13,804
we're

31
00:02:13,804 --> 00:02:15,084
roommates who used the same room.

32
00:02:16,684 --> 00:02:17,324
Right.

33
00:02:18,684 --> 00:02:19,364
Nice to meet you.

34
00:02:19,364 --> 00:02:20,004
It's for you.

35
00:02:20,484 --> 00:02:21,164
Thank you.

36
00:02:24,284 --> 00:02:25,964
The latest RC formula car!

37
00:02:25,964 --> 00:02:27,644
You got to be kidding me!

38
00:02:27,644 --> 00:02:29,284
How did you know I like this?

39
00:02:29,284 --> 00:02:30,804
Because we're connected.

40
00:02:30,804 --> 00:02:31,644
Open it.

41
00:02:35,204 --> 00:02:36,284
Is this your favorite color?

42
00:02:36,884 --> 00:02:38,764
I like red the most.

43
00:02:39,444 --> 00:02:40,404
Try it.

44
00:02:40,404 --> 00:02:41,844
Guys, come down and eat.

45
00:02:41,924 --> 00:02:42,964
You need to twist it.

46
00:02:46,324 --> 00:02:47,244
Isn't this the latest

47
00:02:47,244 --> 00:02:49,084
RC formula car?

48
00:02:50,084 --> 00:02:50,684
What now?

49
00:02:50,684 --> 00:02:52,404
With the new racing car,
you don't have to eat anymore?

50
00:02:52,404 --> 00:02:53,324
I don't want to eat.

51
00:02:53,924 --> 00:02:54,364
Sister Lin Xi,

52
00:02:54,364 --> 00:02:55,244
let's race.

53
00:02:55,244 --> 00:02:55,764
See who's faster.

54
00:02:55,764 --> 00:02:57,084
Okay, drive forward.

55
00:02:57,804 --> 00:02:59,244
Both of you should have a race.

56
00:02:59,244 --> 00:03:00,204
But it's an eating race.

57
00:03:00,204 --> 00:03:02,444
I was wrong. I was wrong!

58
00:03:02,444 --> 00:03:03,164
My slippers.

59
00:03:03,164 --> 00:03:04,924
I dropped my slippers.

60
00:03:04,924 --> 00:03:06,044
Get his slippers over.

61
00:03:06,404 --> 00:03:07,284
Don't catch a cold.

62
00:03:09,564 --> 00:03:10,884
Here, have some prawns.

63
00:03:10,884 --> 00:03:11,804
Thank you, Aunt.

64
00:03:11,804 --> 00:03:12,804
Here's the soup.

65
00:03:13,724 --> 00:03:14,684
Lin Xi,

66
00:03:14,684 --> 00:03:16,764
we don't have to eat takeout anymore.

67
00:03:16,764 --> 00:03:17,924
Because the chef is back.

68
00:03:18,924 --> 00:03:20,004
I'm not the chef.

69
00:03:20,244 --> 00:03:21,404
It's a light meal.

70
00:03:21,524 --> 00:03:22,444
You guys go on and eat.

71
00:03:22,444 --> 00:03:23,004
Eat up.

72
00:03:25,164 --> 00:03:25,924
Thank you, Aunt.

73
00:03:29,044 --> 00:03:29,764
Lin Xi,

74
00:03:30,484 --> 00:03:31,364
how does it taste?

75
00:03:31,884 --> 00:03:32,364
It's delicious.

76
00:03:32,364 --> 00:03:33,524
It tastes like home.

77
00:03:34,004 --> 00:03:35,164
Then, you should eat more.

78
00:03:35,924 --> 00:03:37,284
Eat more if it tastes good.

79
00:03:37,644 --> 00:03:38,604
You have no idea.

80
00:03:38,604 --> 00:03:40,604
Since you and Junxing moved out,

81
00:03:40,884 --> 00:03:42,124
I was quite unaccustomed to it.

82
00:03:43,404 --> 00:03:45,004
I've troubled you for the last semester.

83
00:03:45,004 --> 00:03:46,524
Our school happened
to have unoccupied beds.

84
00:03:47,684 --> 00:03:49,084
It's also good
to live on campus.

85
00:03:49,444 --> 00:03:50,604
If you lived here,

86
00:03:51,004 --> 00:03:53,084
it'd take you an hour to go there.

87
00:03:53,084 --> 00:03:54,404
It'd be over 300 hours in a year.

88
00:03:54,684 --> 00:03:56,724
The time cost is quite high.

89
00:03:57,204 --> 00:03:58,044
Yes, Sir.

90
00:03:58,324 --> 00:03:59,204
If I live on campus,

91
00:03:59,204 --> 00:04:00,564
I can attend night classes.

92
00:04:00,804 --> 00:04:01,844
If there's time,

93
00:04:01,844 --> 00:04:03,164
I can do another half set of papers.

94
00:04:04,244 --> 00:04:05,364
You should keep this spirit

95
00:04:05,364 --> 00:04:07,204
to prepare
for the college entrance exam.

96
00:04:08,484 --> 00:04:10,204
Do you have any plan for your future?

97
00:04:12,204 --> 00:04:14,004
Future? I don't really know.

98
00:04:14,364 --> 00:04:15,644
But I want to go to Jinghua University.

99
00:04:15,644 --> 00:04:16,524
Jinghua University is not bad.

100
00:04:17,004 --> 00:04:18,364
Its international ranking

101
00:04:18,644 --> 00:04:20,244
has been rising lately.

102
00:04:21,084 --> 00:04:22,124
That's enough.

103
00:04:22,764 --> 00:04:24,204
You just got back

104
00:04:24,524 --> 00:04:25,604
but you kept asking questions

105
00:04:26,124 --> 00:04:27,764
as if this was an interview.

106
00:04:27,764 --> 00:04:29,524
How is Lin Xi going to enjoy the meal?

107
00:04:29,804 --> 00:04:30,924
It was my negligence.

108
00:04:32,724 --> 00:04:33,444
Ji Junxing,

109
00:04:33,724 --> 00:04:34,844
get Lin Xi a bowl of soup.

110
00:04:34,844 --> 00:04:35,964
Never mind. I can do it.

111
00:04:39,084 --> 00:04:40,604
When have you become so sensible?

112
00:04:40,844 --> 00:04:42,404
I've become sensible long ago.

113
00:04:42,404 --> 00:04:43,204
That's enough.

114
00:04:43,884 --> 00:04:44,524
Thank you.

115
00:04:44,524 --> 00:04:44,964
You're welcome.

116
00:04:44,964 --> 00:04:46,204
You're good at taking care of others.

117
00:04:46,204 --> 00:04:46,684
Of course.

118
00:04:46,684 --> 00:04:48,044
I'm a gentleman.

119
00:04:48,404 --> 00:04:49,444
Then, get me a bowl too.

120
00:04:49,444 --> 00:04:50,204
Do it yourself.

121
00:04:50,404 --> 00:04:51,204
You're well-fed.

122
00:04:51,564 --> 00:04:52,524
Geez,

123
00:04:52,524 --> 00:04:54,364
the food can't even shut your mouth.

124
00:04:55,084 --> 00:04:56,204
Sister Lin Xi,

125
00:04:56,484 --> 00:04:57,964
time went so fast.

126
00:04:57,964 --> 00:05:00,164
I was going to play
a little longer with you.

127
00:05:00,404 --> 00:05:02,284
Will you come
and eat with us next weekend?

128
00:05:02,684 --> 00:05:03,444
I will.

129
00:05:03,444 --> 00:05:04,484
We can go out and have fun.

130
00:05:04,764 --> 00:05:05,644
Wonderful.

131
00:05:05,724 --> 00:05:07,604
There's a car race next weekend.

132
00:05:07,604 --> 00:05:09,044
Sister Lin Xi, are you coming?

133
00:05:09,044 --> 00:05:09,924
Sure.

134
00:05:10,364 --> 00:05:11,364
I'll come too.

135
00:05:12,724 --> 00:05:14,204
Didn't you just say you're not

136
00:05:14,204 --> 00:05:15,364
interested in the activity

137
00:05:15,364 --> 00:05:16,444
for primary students?

138
00:05:16,444 --> 00:05:18,324
I'm interested now, okay?

139
00:05:18,804 --> 00:05:19,884
What is the location?

140
00:05:20,044 --> 00:05:21,804
Wang Dong and I agreed
to meet up at the park.

141
00:05:22,164 --> 00:05:23,284
Who is Wang Dong?

142
00:05:24,644 --> 00:05:25,684
My tablemate.

143
00:05:26,124 --> 00:05:27,084
Wang Dong is scarier than Voldemort,

144
00:05:27,084 --> 00:05:28,444
and more horrifying than Godzilla.

145
00:05:28,444 --> 00:05:29,724
Did Wang Dong bully you?

146
00:05:31,844 --> 00:05:34,564
Who's that kid?

147
00:05:35,404 --> 00:05:36,164
Lin Xi!

148
00:05:38,804 --> 00:05:39,604
Qin Kai,

149
00:05:40,004 --> 00:05:41,004
why are you here?

150
00:05:41,244 --> 00:05:42,324
It's a coincidence.

151
00:05:42,324 --> 00:05:43,524
I just left the cybercafe.

152
00:05:47,924 --> 00:05:48,924
What an odd coincidence.

153
00:05:49,124 --> 00:05:51,044
You came all the way here
to surf the internet?

154
00:05:51,404 --> 00:05:52,524
Won't the scooter run out of battery?

155
00:05:52,564 --> 00:05:53,884
Thanks for your concern.

156
00:05:53,964 --> 00:05:55,044
It has enough battery
to get me back to school.

157
00:05:55,044 --> 00:05:55,964
Lin Xi, let's go.

158
00:05:55,964 --> 00:05:56,724
It's not necessary.

159
00:05:57,044 --> 00:05:58,324
We'll send her back to school.

160
00:05:58,564 --> 00:05:59,524
It's the middle of the night.

161
00:05:59,524 --> 00:06:00,724
You even have to take care of the kid.

162
00:06:00,964 --> 00:06:01,924
It's troublesome.

163
00:06:02,324 --> 00:06:03,444
It's quite late now.

164
00:06:03,804 --> 00:06:05,244
Ji Luchi has to go home and sleep.

165
00:06:05,524 --> 00:06:06,404
I'll get going.

166
00:06:06,404 --> 00:06:07,004
Bye bye.

167
00:06:07,604 --> 00:06:08,324
Bye bye.

168
00:06:13,924 --> 00:06:14,684
See you at the race.

169
00:06:16,204 --> 00:06:17,684
Bye bye.

170
00:06:17,684 --> 00:06:18,644
Slow down.

171
00:06:19,324 --> 00:06:21,364
The helmet is quite nice.

172
00:06:23,724 --> 00:06:24,284
Junxing,

173
00:06:25,164 --> 00:06:27,164
don't you think it's better

174
00:06:27,164 --> 00:06:27,884
to get a scooter?

175
00:06:28,284 --> 00:06:29,764
Is the scooter the problem?

176
00:06:31,524 --> 00:06:32,444
I got it.

177
00:06:33,404 --> 00:06:34,804
It's your problem.

178
00:06:35,444 --> 00:06:38,044
That dude is more handsome than you.

179
00:06:40,724 --> 00:06:41,964
You little brat!

180
00:06:41,964 --> 00:06:43,724
You favor an outsider over me.

181
00:06:44,324 --> 00:06:44,924
Let's go home.

182
00:06:45,124 --> 00:06:46,644
You're hurting me!

183
00:06:46,644 --> 00:06:47,244
Do you concede?

184
00:06:47,244 --> 00:06:48,284
I was wrong. Help!

185
00:06:48,284 --> 00:06:49,084
Come, let's go home.

186
00:06:49,084 --> 00:06:50,444
I was wrong. I was wrong.

187
00:06:50,444 --> 00:06:51,684
So now, you know that.

188
00:06:53,284 --> 00:06:54,244
Stop there!

189
00:06:57,284 --> 00:06:58,524
Who's the kid?

190
00:06:58,644 --> 00:06:59,964
Ji Junxing's baby brother.

191
00:07:00,044 --> 00:07:00,724
Biological?

192
00:07:00,724 --> 00:07:01,324
Yes.

193
00:07:02,124 --> 00:07:03,444
He had been abroad with Mr. Ji

194
00:07:03,444 --> 00:07:04,404
to convalesce.

195
00:07:04,404 --> 00:07:05,444
He just returned recently.

196
00:07:06,244 --> 00:07:08,244
They've reunited with each other.

197
00:07:08,364 --> 00:07:09,044
It's amazing.

198
00:07:09,164 --> 00:07:10,644
It's not as amazing as I am.

199
00:07:10,964 --> 00:07:12,524
I was born to be wild

200
00:07:12,524 --> 00:07:13,284
and free.

201
00:07:13,284 --> 00:07:14,524
We never interrupted each other.

202
00:07:14,924 --> 00:07:16,044
There's no connection

203
00:07:16,044 --> 00:07:17,244
between you and your family?

204
00:07:17,244 --> 00:07:18,604
Not quite.

205
00:07:18,604 --> 00:07:19,444
I still have my grandpa.

206
00:07:19,444 --> 00:07:21,004
Let's go. I'll take you to him.

207
00:07:21,204 --> 00:07:22,364
Now?

208
00:07:22,364 --> 00:07:23,364
That's so sudden.

209
00:07:23,364 --> 00:07:25,084
He should be sleeping as it's late now.

210
00:07:25,084 --> 00:07:26,884
Rest assured. He's wide awake.

211
00:07:26,884 --> 00:07:27,844
Sit tight.

212
00:07:29,724 --> 00:07:30,764
Slow down.

213
00:07:35,724 --> 00:07:36,404
Isn't this the direction

214
00:07:36,404 --> 00:07:37,644
to our school's boiler room?

215
00:07:38,404 --> 00:07:39,964
Does your grandpa live
in the boiler room?

216
00:07:40,284 --> 00:07:42,764
Technically, he lives
above the boiler room.

217
00:07:43,564 --> 00:07:44,284
Let's go.

218
00:07:48,084 --> 00:07:49,644
That's impressive.

219
00:07:49,644 --> 00:07:50,884
You even found this shortcut.

220
00:07:52,124 --> 00:07:52,924
It's all

221
00:07:52,924 --> 00:07:55,324
for this momentary freedom.

222
00:08:01,084 --> 00:08:02,124
Come, this way.

223
00:08:06,484 --> 00:08:07,524
It really is a boiler room.

224
00:08:08,484 --> 00:08:09,044
Yes.

225
00:08:09,524 --> 00:08:10,484
Hold it for me.

226
00:08:20,404 --> 00:08:21,964
Does your grandpa really live in here?

227
00:08:22,404 --> 00:08:23,844
Why would I lie to you?

228
00:08:24,524 --> 00:08:25,564
Come, this way.

229
00:08:31,444 --> 00:08:32,844
Welcome to my secret base.

230
00:08:32,844 --> 00:08:33,484
Please.

231
00:08:35,004 --> 00:08:37,284
Hello, sorry to interrupt.

232
00:08:41,124 --> 00:08:42,044
Where is he?

233
00:08:42,764 --> 00:08:43,604
He's here.

234
00:08:47,444 --> 00:08:48,524
This is my grandpa.

235
00:08:49,244 --> 00:08:50,604
Isn't this a grass?

236
00:08:51,204 --> 00:08:52,644
Watch your words.

237
00:08:52,644 --> 00:08:53,644
It's called Li Bai.

238
00:08:54,164 --> 00:08:54,964
Your grandpa?

239
00:08:55,244 --> 00:08:56,084
Li Bai?

240
00:08:56,524 --> 00:08:57,444
Then, mine would be Du Fu.

241
00:08:58,564 --> 00:08:59,884
It's not the Li.

242
00:08:59,884 --> 00:09:01,204
It's the inside "Li".

243
00:09:01,204 --> 00:09:02,084
It's a fern

244
00:09:02,084 --> 00:09:04,004
which exists earlier than the dinosaurs.

245
00:09:04,684 --> 00:09:06,444
We can absolutely call it
Great Grandfather.

246
00:09:07,284 --> 00:09:08,124
So,

247
00:09:08,124 --> 00:09:10,044
you kept your precious

248
00:09:10,044 --> 00:09:12,044
Great Grandfather in this boiler room.

249
00:09:12,044 --> 00:09:14,484
Don't underestimate
this boiler room of mine.

250
00:09:14,484 --> 00:09:16,404
It's small but fully equipped.

251
00:09:16,404 --> 00:09:17,844
We can eat, drink and have fun here.

252
00:09:18,804 --> 00:09:20,924
Next, let me introduce this

253
00:09:21,364 --> 00:09:21,964
to you.

254
00:09:22,444 --> 00:09:24,444
Monilaria moniliformis seeds.

255
00:09:25,804 --> 00:09:27,404
It looks nothing like a bunny.

256
00:09:28,564 --> 00:09:30,284
It's only a brain now.

257
00:09:30,284 --> 00:09:31,564
But over time,

258
00:09:31,564 --> 00:09:33,404
it'll grow bunny ears.

259
00:09:33,724 --> 00:09:34,444
Is that so?

260
00:09:34,444 --> 00:09:35,124
Tell me when it grows out.

261
00:09:35,124 --> 00:09:36,164
I want to check it out.

262
00:09:37,164 --> 00:09:38,844
Then, I've got to protect it.

263
00:09:39,084 --> 00:09:40,884
Or else it'll die before the bunny ears

264
00:09:40,884 --> 00:09:41,804
grow out.

265
00:09:42,204 --> 00:09:42,964
Touch wood.

266
00:09:43,404 --> 00:09:44,444
Don't listen to him.

267
00:09:46,484 --> 00:09:48,764
I didn't expect a person like you

268
00:09:48,764 --> 00:09:50,124
would grow plants.

269
00:09:52,484 --> 00:09:54,044
It's a long story.

270
00:09:55,564 --> 00:09:57,284
Come. Sit down.

271
00:09:57,284 --> 00:09:58,404
I'll tell you about it.

272
00:10:02,204 --> 00:10:05,124
Actually, I like plants

273
00:10:05,364 --> 00:10:06,524
by happenstance.

274
00:10:07,404 --> 00:10:10,324
When I was a kid, my dad went
to Australia to do business.

275
00:10:10,644 --> 00:10:11,844
So he brought me with him.

276
00:10:12,364 --> 00:10:14,524
But he didn't have time to care for me.

277
00:10:15,124 --> 00:10:16,164
What about your mom?

278
00:10:18,724 --> 00:10:19,684
My mom.

279
00:10:20,484 --> 00:10:21,764
She didn't go.

280
00:10:24,684 --> 00:10:25,684
Let me finish.

281
00:10:26,404 --> 00:10:29,124
That time, I always looked
at those succulent plants

282
00:10:29,124 --> 00:10:30,564
at the door

283
00:10:30,564 --> 00:10:32,644
which were taller than me.

284
00:10:33,364 --> 00:10:35,084
When I was bored,

285
00:10:35,084 --> 00:10:37,724
I would talk to them,

286
00:10:38,204 --> 00:10:39,284
and chat with them.

287
00:10:40,204 --> 00:10:41,444
One day, I suddenly found

288
00:10:41,444 --> 00:10:43,244
that they grew better every day.

289
00:10:43,684 --> 00:10:45,204
That time, I thought

290
00:10:47,004 --> 00:10:50,164
plants were actually quite righteous.

291
00:10:52,124 --> 00:10:53,524
If you treat it well,

292
00:10:54,324 --> 00:10:55,484
it'll also be nice to you.

293
00:10:57,484 --> 00:10:58,804
It's more reliable than human.

294
00:11:00,124 --> 00:11:02,844
It feels like
your relationship with them

295
00:11:03,284 --> 00:11:06,044
is like the little prince
and his roses.

296
00:11:07,364 --> 00:11:08,764
You tame it

297
00:11:09,404 --> 00:11:10,364
and it accompanies you.

298
00:11:14,444 --> 00:11:16,804
You can tame me.

299
00:11:17,084 --> 00:11:18,324
I'll keep you company.

300
00:11:19,924 --> 00:11:21,164
I'm not a trainer.

301
00:11:21,524 --> 00:11:22,244
We're done here.

302
00:11:22,244 --> 00:11:23,124
Let's go.

303
00:11:27,204 --> 00:11:28,004
What are you doing?

304
00:11:28,764 --> 00:11:29,724
I'm not leaving.

305
00:11:30,084 --> 00:11:31,764
Staying here to watch movie is

306
00:11:31,764 --> 00:11:33,164
better than going back to the dorm.

307
00:11:33,604 --> 00:11:34,964
What if the security finds out?

308
00:11:35,884 --> 00:11:37,844
So you've got
to keep it a secret for me.

309
00:11:39,324 --> 00:11:40,004
Okay.

310
00:11:40,444 --> 00:11:42,244
This is just between me and you

311
00:11:42,244 --> 00:11:42,924
and Grandpa.

312
00:11:42,924 --> 00:11:43,444
I'm leaving.

313
00:11:44,284 --> 00:11:45,484
Do you remember the way out?

314
00:11:45,804 --> 00:11:46,564
I remember it.

315
00:11:46,564 --> 00:11:47,884
Who am I? I'm Lin Xi.

316
00:11:48,084 --> 00:11:49,004
Stay safe.

317
00:11:49,004 --> 00:11:49,924
Okay.

318
00:12:02,604 --> 00:12:04,284
Yangtze River. Great Wall.

319
00:12:05,084 --> 00:12:07,964
Mount Huangshan. Yellow River.

320
00:12:07,964 --> 00:12:12,724
Weight thousand pounds in my mind.

321
00:12:13,244 --> 00:12:15,684
Whensoever,

322
00:12:16,164 --> 00:12:19,604
and wheresoever,

323
00:12:19,924 --> 00:12:22,484
my heart's always...

324
00:12:27,284 --> 00:12:28,284
Why is the water so cold?

325
00:12:39,524 --> 00:12:40,244
Who is it?

326
00:12:40,484 --> 00:12:41,764
Who turned the heater off?

327
00:12:54,700 --> 00:12:58,040
(Gas Boiler No Smoking)

328
00:13:16,524 --> 00:13:17,644
Qin Kai.

329
00:13:19,564 --> 00:13:20,884
It's you again.

330
00:13:38,364 --> 00:13:39,964
This is the car I gave Ji Luchi.

331
00:13:39,964 --> 00:13:41,284
Why is it here with you?

332
00:13:41,284 --> 00:13:42,404
Does he not like it?

333
00:13:43,444 --> 00:13:44,604
He likes it so much

334
00:13:44,604 --> 00:13:46,084
that he'll use it to race
with Wang Dong.

335
00:13:46,604 --> 00:13:47,724
So he asks me to remodel it.

336
00:13:48,524 --> 00:13:49,444
Keep it up.

337
00:13:51,404 --> 00:13:53,484
Now, I'll announce a punishment.

338
00:13:54,044 --> 00:13:56,884
Last night, Qin Kai
from Class 12, Grade Two

339
00:13:57,164 --> 00:13:58,844
broke into the boiler room

340
00:13:59,324 --> 00:14:00,564
and closed the heater valve,

341
00:14:00,804 --> 00:14:02,804
causing hot water outages
in the bathroom.

342
00:14:03,364 --> 00:14:05,444
This is a bad behaviour.

343
00:14:05,724 --> 00:14:07,284
This is a serious violation
of the school rules.

344
00:14:07,524 --> 00:14:08,724
He's now given a reprimand.

345
00:14:09,244 --> 00:14:11,404
Fellow students,
please take warning from it.

346
00:14:13,124 --> 00:14:14,964
Did he really get caught?

347
00:14:17,844 --> 00:14:19,404
You went to the boiler room last night?

348
00:14:19,884 --> 00:14:20,844
Hmm.

349
00:14:23,364 --> 00:14:24,524
Why did you go there

350
00:14:24,524 --> 00:14:25,404
instead of returning to the dorm?

351
00:14:27,284 --> 00:14:29,044
Were you in on this?

352
00:14:30,644 --> 00:14:31,364
No.

353
00:14:33,244 --> 00:14:34,684
It's hard to explain.

354
00:14:46,924 --> 00:14:49,124
A home theater. A projector?

355
00:14:51,324 --> 00:14:52,284
A speaker.

356
00:14:53,484 --> 00:14:54,484
A blanket.

357
00:14:54,484 --> 00:14:55,324
And cup noodles.

358
00:14:55,924 --> 00:14:56,924
Look.

359
00:14:58,164 --> 00:14:59,724
You've prepared all kinds of stuff.

360
00:15:01,164 --> 00:15:02,284
Do you take the boiler room

361
00:15:02,284 --> 00:15:03,284
as a home theater?

362
00:15:03,564 --> 00:15:04,324
So-so.

363
00:15:04,644 --> 00:15:05,684
It's warm in Winter
and refreshing in Summer.

364
00:15:05,684 --> 00:15:06,844
But it has poor soundproofing.

365
00:15:07,124 --> 00:15:08,004
It's too bad

366
00:15:08,004 --> 00:15:10,004
that I can't use
this 360-degree Surround Sound Speaker.

367
00:15:10,004 --> 00:15:11,524
Wipe that smirk off your face.

368
00:15:12,484 --> 00:15:13,844
I asked to see your parents last time.

369
00:15:14,484 --> 00:15:15,084
Where are they?

370
00:15:15,724 --> 00:15:17,044
Didn't I already tell you

371
00:15:17,364 --> 00:15:18,884
that I don't have parents?

372
00:15:19,644 --> 00:15:21,804
Then, did you pop out from a stone?

373
00:15:21,804 --> 00:15:23,044
You can interpret it that way.

374
00:15:23,044 --> 00:15:24,524
I'm like a dandelion now.

375
00:15:25,044 --> 00:15:26,004
I don't have a fixed place to go.

376
00:15:28,444 --> 00:15:29,804
Do you think I'm joking with you?

377
00:15:30,364 --> 00:15:31,204
Let me tell you this.

378
00:15:31,724 --> 00:15:32,644
The school principal

379
00:15:32,644 --> 00:15:33,844
has known about this matter.

380
00:15:34,084 --> 00:15:35,684
He's going to take this
as a bad example

381
00:15:35,684 --> 00:15:36,804
and seriously deal with it.

382
00:15:37,084 --> 00:15:39,364
Mr. Xie, let me off just this once.

383
00:15:39,644 --> 00:15:41,044
I won't go there again.

384
00:15:41,364 --> 00:15:42,204
Let you off?

385
00:15:43,244 --> 00:15:45,084
I've let you off

386
00:15:45,084 --> 00:15:46,244
too many times.

387
00:15:47,084 --> 00:15:48,524
I must see your parents this time.

388
00:15:48,884 --> 00:15:49,524
Mr. Xie,

389
00:15:49,844 --> 00:15:51,124
I can do everything you say.

390
00:15:51,124 --> 00:15:52,524
Just don't make me ask them to come.

391
00:15:52,844 --> 00:15:54,284
Do you think this is a market?

392
00:15:55,044 --> 00:15:56,524
That you can bargain with me?

393
00:15:57,484 --> 00:15:58,244
I tell you what.

394
00:15:58,644 --> 00:15:59,364
Next Monday,

395
00:15:59,604 --> 00:16:01,044
your parents must come.

396
00:16:01,404 --> 00:16:02,244
If not,

397
00:16:02,524 --> 00:16:04,084
pack your stuff and leave.

398
00:16:04,564 --> 00:16:05,924
Didn't you say you're a dandelion?

399
00:16:05,924 --> 00:16:07,484
Just go anywhere you like.

400
00:16:09,164 --> 00:16:10,044
There's no other way?

401
00:16:10,524 --> 00:16:11,484
This is the only way.

402
00:16:15,884 --> 00:16:17,484
How much longer will

403
00:16:17,484 --> 00:16:18,764
the international meeting take?

404
00:16:19,084 --> 00:16:20,124
I've waited for a day.

405
00:16:20,324 --> 00:16:21,204
Sorry.

406
00:16:21,204 --> 00:16:22,284
I guess it'll be quite late.

407
00:16:22,284 --> 00:16:23,644
Is this something urgent?

408
00:16:23,644 --> 00:16:24,444
What about tomorrow...

409
00:16:24,444 --> 00:16:25,204
It's not necessary.

410
00:16:25,404 --> 00:16:26,484
I can't afford a delay

411
00:16:26,484 --> 00:16:27,764
in his billion worth of business.

412
00:16:28,324 --> 00:16:29,004
You tell him

413
00:16:29,004 --> 00:16:30,524
that I'm on my way to the crematorium

414
00:16:30,804 --> 00:16:31,764
to commit suicide.

415
00:16:31,884 --> 00:16:32,924
I won't trouble him.

416
00:16:35,764 --> 00:16:36,724
Qin Kai.

417
00:16:40,044 --> 00:16:40,964
Are you alright?

418
00:16:41,244 --> 00:16:42,604
I heard this is quite serious

419
00:16:42,604 --> 00:16:43,604
that they want to meet your parents.

420
00:16:43,604 --> 00:16:44,404
It's alright.

421
00:16:44,404 --> 00:16:45,804
This is just a small matter.

422
00:16:46,444 --> 00:16:47,244
Are you sure?

423
00:16:47,484 --> 00:16:47,964
Yes.

424
00:16:48,244 --> 00:16:49,324
It's just asking my parents to come.

425
00:16:50,884 --> 00:16:51,724
I've got work to do.

426
00:16:51,724 --> 00:16:52,724
Go back to your classroom.

427
00:16:52,724 --> 00:16:53,564
Class is about to begin.

428
00:17:00,124 --> 00:17:00,724
Kai.

429
00:17:03,604 --> 00:17:04,484
Are you alright?

430
00:17:08,644 --> 00:17:09,204
Kai.

431
00:17:10,204 --> 00:17:10,964
Kai.

432
00:17:13,404 --> 00:17:14,284
Black Bull!

433
00:17:19,244 --> 00:17:20,644
Is Qin Kai really okay?

434
00:17:22,604 --> 00:17:23,524
Don't go there.

435
00:17:23,524 --> 00:17:23,964
He's been

436
00:17:23,964 --> 00:17:24,924
distressed all day

437
00:17:24,924 --> 00:17:25,964
because of his parents.

438
00:17:26,284 --> 00:17:26,964
What's wrong?

439
00:17:26,964 --> 00:17:28,044
His parents are not coming?

440
00:17:28,244 --> 00:17:29,644
His dad is as busy as a superman.

441
00:17:29,644 --> 00:17:31,284
He almost detaches
from the gravity.

442
00:17:31,524 --> 00:17:32,564
Even if he contacted his dad,

443
00:17:32,804 --> 00:17:34,204
his dad would yell at him

444
00:17:34,204 --> 00:17:35,604
and get his secretary
to handle it.

445
00:17:36,404 --> 00:17:37,404
What about his mom?

446
00:17:38,764 --> 00:17:39,844
His mom would like to come.

447
00:17:39,844 --> 00:17:40,724
But she can't.

448
00:17:40,924 --> 00:17:42,124
His mom is not at home too?

449
00:17:42,484 --> 00:17:43,364
His mom

450
00:17:43,764 --> 00:17:45,204
passed away when he was five.

451
00:17:49,924 --> 00:17:51,524
He didn't tell me this.

452
00:17:52,404 --> 00:17:53,524
This is how Kai is.

453
00:17:53,804 --> 00:17:55,244
He doesn't like being worried about.

454
00:17:55,484 --> 00:17:56,684
He's like an orphan.

455
00:17:56,964 --> 00:17:58,164
What do you think he should do?

456
00:18:04,324 --> 00:18:06,284
So you want to borrow

457
00:18:06,724 --> 00:18:07,444
a mother?

458
00:18:09,044 --> 00:18:10,044
That's new.

459
00:18:10,484 --> 00:18:12,284
I've only heard
of borrowing books, money

460
00:18:12,284 --> 00:18:13,284
and meal card.

461
00:18:13,284 --> 00:18:14,924
It's my first time seeing
someone borrow a mother.

462
00:18:15,084 --> 00:18:16,804
If you want to borrow money,

463
00:18:16,804 --> 00:18:18,484
our commissary can make
a little contribution.

464
00:18:18,644 --> 00:18:19,924
Just don't forget about the interest.

465
00:18:19,924 --> 00:18:21,084
I don't want money or card.

466
00:18:21,084 --> 00:18:22,204
I just want a mother.

467
00:18:23,004 --> 00:18:23,924
I beg of you guys.

468
00:18:24,084 --> 00:18:25,404
If Qin Kai couldn't get a mother,

469
00:18:25,404 --> 00:18:26,604
he would be expelled from school.

470
00:18:27,484 --> 00:18:29,364
You can get someone under a bridge
with only RMB 100 a day.

471
00:18:29,364 --> 00:18:30,324
So no one will be troubled.

472
00:18:31,844 --> 00:18:33,404
There's no time for it.

473
00:18:33,724 --> 00:18:34,404
And we have to find

474
00:18:34,404 --> 00:18:36,124
someone who's about our parents' ages.

475
00:18:36,124 --> 00:18:37,004
So she won't get caught.

476
00:18:38,644 --> 00:18:39,964
Count me out.

477
00:18:40,284 --> 00:18:41,884
There's no way
my dad can't recognize my mom.

478
00:18:42,524 --> 00:18:43,804
I don't think my mom can do it either.

479
00:18:43,804 --> 00:18:45,124
She's bad at acting.

480
00:18:45,124 --> 00:18:46,844
She can't even hide her emotion
when she gets a hit in a card game.

481
00:18:46,844 --> 00:18:47,764
If she came

482
00:18:47,764 --> 00:18:49,084
and spilled the beans,

483
00:18:49,084 --> 00:18:50,484
Qin Kai and I would get expelled.

484
00:18:53,364 --> 00:18:54,044
Sorry.

485
00:18:54,324 --> 00:18:56,084
My parents are always away from home.

486
00:18:56,404 --> 00:18:57,124
It has always been

487
00:18:57,124 --> 00:18:58,684
my aunt who attends
my parent-teacher meeting.

488
00:19:01,764 --> 00:19:02,644
Don't look at me.

489
00:19:03,004 --> 00:19:04,724
You haven't met my mother.

490
00:19:05,044 --> 00:19:06,364
It's unfulfilling to handle
the family affairs.

491
00:19:06,644 --> 00:19:08,524
She'll often come to school
and look into my situation.

492
00:19:08,884 --> 00:19:09,924
She could talk to Mr. Xie

493
00:19:09,924 --> 00:19:11,724
all afternoon
in the parent-teacher meeting.

494
00:19:11,764 --> 00:19:13,444
Every teacher knows her.

495
00:19:18,084 --> 00:19:18,844
Xing,

496
00:19:19,364 --> 00:19:20,284
you're the only hope

497
00:19:20,284 --> 00:19:21,524
in our team.

498
00:19:23,164 --> 00:19:25,004
My mom is quite good at acting

499
00:19:25,284 --> 00:19:26,244
and she's open-minded.

500
00:19:26,924 --> 00:19:28,084
Besides, she doesn't have

501
00:19:28,084 --> 00:19:29,164
much contact with Mr. Xie.

502
00:19:31,244 --> 00:19:32,204
The point is

503
00:19:34,164 --> 00:19:35,324
why I should help him.

504
00:19:42,044 --> 00:19:42,964
It's no use acting cute.

505
00:19:59,084 --> 00:19:59,924
Ji Junxing.

506
00:20:01,604 --> 00:20:03,164
Qin Kai is your roommate.

507
00:20:03,164 --> 00:20:03,884
Are you going

508
00:20:03,884 --> 00:20:05,364
to watch him teeter
on the verge of despair?

509
00:20:05,364 --> 00:20:06,884
Don't you have a heart?

510
00:20:07,564 --> 00:20:08,604
Why would he want
to borrow a mother?

511
00:20:08,724 --> 00:20:09,764
Doesn't he have one?

512
00:20:09,964 --> 00:20:11,324
His mom can't make it here.

513
00:20:13,124 --> 00:20:14,244
You knew

514
00:20:14,564 --> 00:20:17,084
Qin Kai is a lonely person.

515
00:20:18,524 --> 00:20:19,484
Lonely?

516
00:20:19,644 --> 00:20:20,684
I'm lonely too.

517
00:20:20,844 --> 00:20:22,364
Everyone was born to be on their own.

518
00:20:22,924 --> 00:20:24,324
His mom passed away.

519
00:21:00,044 --> 00:21:01,244
You want to borrow a mother, right?

520
00:21:01,684 --> 00:21:02,644
How did you know that?

521
00:21:02,964 --> 00:21:04,164
Everyone knows about it.

522
00:21:04,844 --> 00:21:06,724
I'll go home and talk with my mom.

523
00:21:06,724 --> 00:21:07,644
I'll keep you posted.

524
00:21:08,524 --> 00:21:09,884
That would be great.

525
00:21:11,044 --> 00:21:13,284
But can she handle it?

526
00:21:13,964 --> 00:21:15,204
Don't get your hopes up.

527
00:21:15,564 --> 00:21:16,564
If you have a plan B,

528
00:21:16,564 --> 00:21:17,324
execute it now.

529
00:21:17,564 --> 00:21:18,484
But it is

530
00:21:18,484 --> 00:21:19,684
when plan A fails.

531
00:21:22,324 --> 00:21:22,884
Let's go.

532
00:21:22,884 --> 00:21:23,564
What are you doing?

533
00:21:23,804 --> 00:21:24,324
Get off.

534
00:21:24,604 --> 00:21:25,844
Since we've recognized
each other as relatives,

535
00:21:25,844 --> 00:21:26,804
let's go all the way.

536
00:21:27,164 --> 00:21:28,044
Let's go home.

537
00:21:52,524 --> 00:21:52,924
Mom.

538
00:21:52,924 --> 00:21:54,324
Why are you suddenly back?

539
00:21:56,124 --> 00:21:56,764
Mom.

540
00:21:59,604 --> 00:22:00,444
That's enough.

541
00:22:03,244 --> 00:22:04,684
Mom, I've got something to tell you.

542
00:22:09,604 --> 00:22:12,044
So this is how it is.

543
00:22:13,164 --> 00:22:14,284
So you're asking me

544
00:22:14,284 --> 00:22:15,604
to be his mom for a day?

545
00:22:16,044 --> 00:22:17,004
One day. That's all.

546
00:22:17,764 --> 00:22:19,124
Help us, Mom.

547
00:22:31,804 --> 00:22:33,724
You're Ji Junxing's baby brother,
aren't you?

548
00:22:34,124 --> 00:22:34,684
Yes, I am.

549
00:22:35,004 --> 00:22:35,764
You are

550
00:22:35,764 --> 00:22:37,484
the guy who abducted
Sister Lin Xi, aren't you?

551
00:22:37,924 --> 00:22:39,244
You've got a good eyesight.

552
00:22:39,244 --> 00:22:39,844
You're right.

553
00:22:40,084 --> 00:22:42,364
Besides, I'll soon become your brother.

554
00:22:44,444 --> 00:22:45,964
This is all I can do for you.

555
00:22:45,964 --> 00:22:48,004
You're on your own for the rest.

556
00:22:48,324 --> 00:22:49,164
It's alright.

557
00:22:49,164 --> 00:22:51,164
I'll find a way to make it work.

558
00:22:52,964 --> 00:22:53,804
Here.

559
00:22:58,124 --> 00:22:59,604
Aunt, these dumplings you made

560
00:22:59,604 --> 00:23:00,604
have thin wraps and lots of stuffing.

561
00:23:00,604 --> 00:23:01,724
They're fresh and tender.

562
00:23:01,724 --> 00:23:04,164
It's like a three Michelin-starred dish.

563
00:23:04,164 --> 00:23:05,724
They are frozen dumplings.

564
00:23:05,724 --> 00:23:06,564
It's from the supermarket.

565
00:23:06,924 --> 00:23:08,244
And you haven't tried it.

566
00:23:08,244 --> 00:23:09,884
How did you know it's fresh?

567
00:23:12,044 --> 00:23:14,084
As she does well
in choosing frozen dumplings,

568
00:23:14,084 --> 00:23:14,804
what does it mean?

569
00:23:15,044 --> 00:23:17,204
It means your mom has
good taste in things.

570
00:23:18,644 --> 00:23:20,204
Enough, stop cozying up to me.

571
00:23:20,364 --> 00:23:21,164
Junxing has told me

572
00:23:21,164 --> 00:23:22,364
about what happened to you.

573
00:23:22,684 --> 00:23:24,404
I don't think it's a big deal.

574
00:23:24,404 --> 00:23:25,044
I can help you.

575
00:23:25,284 --> 00:23:25,924
Really?

576
00:23:28,084 --> 00:23:30,924
Do you really understand my situation?

577
00:23:31,364 --> 00:23:32,924
It was just a mistake.

578
00:23:33,324 --> 00:23:34,404
Everyone makes mistakes.

579
00:23:34,884 --> 00:23:35,764
Unless this person

580
00:23:35,764 --> 00:23:37,604
has never tried new things.

581
00:23:38,324 --> 00:23:40,244
It wasn't a general mistake I made.

582
00:23:40,884 --> 00:23:43,924
I'm numero uno
on the Dean of Student's blacklist.

583
00:23:44,684 --> 00:23:45,564
Making a mistake

584
00:23:45,564 --> 00:23:46,964
doesn't mean anything.

585
00:23:47,244 --> 00:23:48,164
As long as you change it.

586
00:23:48,404 --> 00:23:49,724
Aunt, you're so open-minded.

587
00:23:50,084 --> 00:23:51,644
I'll see you at school
tomorrow afternoon.

588
00:23:52,164 --> 00:23:52,684
Sure.

589
00:23:52,924 --> 00:23:54,124
I'll meet you at the school gate.

590
00:23:54,404 --> 00:23:55,644
Aunt, promise me you'll go.

591
00:23:55,884 --> 00:23:57,084
If not,

592
00:23:57,524 --> 00:23:59,004
I'll have to rove all over the world.

593
00:23:59,964 --> 00:24:00,884
Don't worry.

594
00:24:01,204 --> 00:24:02,084
Tomorrow,

595
00:24:02,444 --> 00:24:03,644
I'll be your mother.

596
00:24:04,444 --> 00:24:05,004
Eat up.

597
00:24:05,004 --> 00:24:06,204
Mom.

598
00:24:06,844 --> 00:24:07,444
Let's say

599
00:24:07,444 --> 00:24:08,804
if I made

600
00:24:08,804 --> 00:24:09,764
a grave mistake,

601
00:24:10,044 --> 00:24:11,204
can I borrow a mother as well?

602
00:24:12,644 --> 00:24:14,284
Well, you have to ask your dad
if he agrees or not.

603
00:24:14,364 --> 00:24:15,364
Forget it.

604
00:24:16,124 --> 00:24:18,364
I think he'll break my bones.

605
00:24:20,084 --> 00:24:21,244
I'm glad you know that.

606
00:24:21,564 --> 00:24:22,324
Eat up.

607
00:24:23,324 --> 00:24:24,564
Here, eat more.

608
00:24:24,684 --> 00:24:25,404
Thanks, Aunt.

609
00:24:25,884 --> 00:24:26,844
Here, eat the dumplings.

610
00:24:27,324 --> 00:24:28,524
I've already got a lot.

611
00:24:28,884 --> 00:24:29,644
Just eat it.

612
00:24:31,044 --> 00:24:32,404
He must've eaten a lot.

613
00:24:32,804 --> 00:24:33,644
You eat it.

614
00:25:06,724 --> 00:25:07,484
Mrs. Qin,

615
00:25:08,364 --> 00:25:09,404
it's so hard

616
00:25:09,844 --> 00:25:10,924
to see you in person.

617
00:25:11,764 --> 00:25:12,764
Sorry.

618
00:25:13,244 --> 00:25:14,244
I was too busy.

619
00:25:15,524 --> 00:25:16,084
Yes.

620
00:25:17,084 --> 00:25:17,964
Even so,

621
00:25:17,964 --> 00:25:19,724
you should take time
to discipline your kid.

622
00:25:20,564 --> 00:25:22,124
Are you aware of Qin Kai's situation

623
00:25:22,564 --> 00:25:23,404
at school?

624
00:25:25,364 --> 00:25:26,044
What's the matter?

625
00:25:26,684 --> 00:25:27,604
Did he cause trouble again?

626
00:25:29,604 --> 00:25:30,964
About his academic result,

627
00:25:30,964 --> 00:25:31,884
I won't talk much.

628
00:25:32,284 --> 00:25:33,324
He's always in the last place.

629
00:25:33,764 --> 00:25:34,684
The total scores

630
00:25:34,964 --> 00:25:35,604
of all subjects

631
00:25:35,604 --> 00:25:37,164
are less than 200.

632
00:25:38,364 --> 00:25:39,924
It's worse this time.

633
00:25:40,204 --> 00:25:42,164
He broke into the boiler room,

634
00:25:42,444 --> 00:25:44,404
causing hot water outages in the school.

635
00:25:45,564 --> 00:25:47,164
The school is looking at ways

636
00:25:47,164 --> 00:25:48,484
to see

637
00:25:48,764 --> 00:25:50,084
if we should expel him.

638
00:25:52,884 --> 00:25:53,844
Perfect.

639
00:25:54,284 --> 00:25:55,164
I'm here today

640
00:25:55,404 --> 00:25:57,524
to withdraw him from school.

641
00:25:58,804 --> 00:25:59,964
What does Aunt mean?

642
00:25:59,964 --> 00:26:00,844
What's going on?

643
00:26:01,484 --> 00:26:02,364
Just trust my mom.

644
00:26:02,964 --> 00:26:04,284
I'm sure she has a mind of her own.

645
00:26:04,364 --> 00:26:05,724
What do you mean?

646
00:26:06,364 --> 00:26:07,444
Frankly speaking,

647
00:26:07,444 --> 00:26:08,004
I wasn't going

648
00:26:08,004 --> 00:26:09,644
to let him go to school
this semester.

649
00:26:10,124 --> 00:26:11,324
I'm too busy.

650
00:26:11,724 --> 00:26:13,844
I don't have time
to handle some crap like this.

651
00:26:14,124 --> 00:26:15,244
Leaving him at school

652
00:26:15,524 --> 00:26:17,724
will only bring troubles
to you and the school.

653
00:26:18,124 --> 00:26:20,364
Mom, give me one more chance.

654
00:26:21,004 --> 00:26:22,364
Mr. Xie, help me convince my mom.

655
00:26:22,364 --> 00:26:23,204
I want to go to school.

656
00:26:23,204 --> 00:26:24,044
Yes, right.

657
00:26:24,764 --> 00:26:25,484
Actually,

658
00:26:25,484 --> 00:26:27,524
things are not that serious.

659
00:26:27,884 --> 00:26:30,204
We can find a solution together.

660
00:26:30,724 --> 00:26:31,484
Forget it.

661
00:26:31,884 --> 00:26:33,764
He's not good at studies.

662
00:26:34,124 --> 00:26:35,164
I think

663
00:26:35,164 --> 00:26:36,764
it's better to let him enter society

664
00:26:37,044 --> 00:26:39,044
to gain work experiences.

665
00:26:39,324 --> 00:26:40,524
Mom, I'm still a kid.

666
00:26:40,524 --> 00:26:41,964
I haven't graduated from high school.

667
00:26:42,324 --> 00:26:44,004
How can I compete
with the people in society?

668
00:26:44,004 --> 00:26:44,644
Mr. Xie.

669
00:26:44,644 --> 00:26:45,204
Yes, right.

670
00:26:45,204 --> 00:26:46,524
Qin Kai is right.

671
00:26:46,884 --> 00:26:47,484
Besides,

672
00:26:47,484 --> 00:26:49,204
he's in his second year
of high school now.

673
00:26:49,524 --> 00:26:51,764
There's still hope if he works harder

674
00:26:51,764 --> 00:26:52,964
in the cultural classes.

675
00:26:55,844 --> 00:26:56,884
So you're not going to expel him?

676
00:27:06,204 --> 00:27:08,084
Our school won't easily give up

677
00:27:08,084 --> 00:27:09,404
on any one of our students.

678
00:27:10,044 --> 00:27:11,364
Especially at a time like this,

679
00:27:11,364 --> 00:27:13,284
parents must not be discouraged.

680
00:27:13,764 --> 00:27:14,684
I asked you over

681
00:27:14,684 --> 00:27:15,524
just to wish

682
00:27:15,524 --> 00:27:16,924
that you could work with us.

683
00:27:17,164 --> 00:27:18,724
Parents can't just leave the kids

684
00:27:18,724 --> 00:27:20,444
at school without caring for them.

685
00:27:21,044 --> 00:27:21,924
You should care more

686
00:27:22,284 --> 00:27:24,644
about his physical and mental health.

687
00:27:28,844 --> 00:27:29,484
Well, then.

688
00:27:29,884 --> 00:27:31,084
If you say so,

689
00:27:31,284 --> 00:27:33,204
I'll go home and talk to him.

690
00:27:33,204 --> 00:27:34,244
Yes.

691
00:27:36,404 --> 00:27:37,924
This is my phone number.

692
00:27:39,764 --> 00:27:41,484
If he makes troubles again,

693
00:27:41,684 --> 00:27:43,164
feel free to call me.

694
00:27:44,284 --> 00:27:45,484
Okay, sure.

695
00:27:47,324 --> 00:27:47,884
Thank you.

696
00:27:49,124 --> 00:27:50,084
This is my job.

697
00:27:54,844 --> 00:27:55,684
Mr. Xie,

698
00:27:56,764 --> 00:27:57,564
you're not going to expel me?

699
00:27:57,964 --> 00:27:58,764
Cut the nonsense.

700
00:27:58,764 --> 00:27:59,524
Go write an apology.

701
00:27:59,524 --> 00:28:00,364
Okay.

702
00:28:00,364 --> 00:28:01,124
Bye bye.

703
00:28:07,444 --> 00:28:09,404
Aunt, you're really good at acting.

704
00:28:09,564 --> 00:28:10,684
You retreated in order to advance.

705
00:28:10,684 --> 00:28:11,764
That was really convincing.

706
00:28:13,324 --> 00:28:14,524
No matter how good my acting is,

707
00:28:14,524 --> 00:28:16,324
I can only help you once.

708
00:28:16,604 --> 00:28:18,244
I can't help you all your lives.

709
00:28:18,404 --> 00:28:19,364
Rest assured.

710
00:28:19,644 --> 00:28:20,324
This is the first time

711
00:28:20,324 --> 00:28:21,324
and also the last time.

712
00:28:21,604 --> 00:28:23,164
I won't bother you anymore.

713
00:28:23,804 --> 00:28:25,164
It's no big deal to trouble me.

714
00:28:25,404 --> 00:28:26,844
But this is your life.

715
00:28:27,004 --> 00:28:28,364
You have to be responsible for it.

716
00:28:28,604 --> 00:28:30,244
Didn't you say so yourself?

717
00:28:30,484 --> 00:28:31,644
What can people

718
00:28:31,644 --> 00:28:33,084
of your age do in society?

719
00:28:33,924 --> 00:28:36,364
Actually, I just realized

720
00:28:36,364 --> 00:28:38,644
that I was quite afraid
of being expelled.

721
00:28:40,764 --> 00:28:41,964
Go back and study hard.

722
00:28:42,204 --> 00:28:43,044
I'll get going.

723
00:28:43,284 --> 00:28:44,164
Well, Aunt,

724
00:28:45,364 --> 00:28:46,684
if I have time,

725
00:28:46,684 --> 00:28:48,524
can I go to your place
and eat dumplings?

726
00:28:50,204 --> 00:28:51,444
Of course you can.

727
00:28:51,444 --> 00:28:52,884
You're always welcome.

728
00:28:52,884 --> 00:28:53,684
Thank you, Aunt.

729
00:28:54,124 --> 00:28:54,804
I should go.

730
00:28:55,204 --> 00:28:56,004
Goodbye, Aunt.

731
00:28:56,284 --> 00:28:56,964
Goodbye.

732
00:29:06,124 --> 00:29:07,084
Thank you.

733
00:29:08,244 --> 00:29:09,484
You should thank my mom.

734
00:29:14,844 --> 00:29:15,524
Oh, no.

735
00:29:16,284 --> 00:29:17,044
What's wrong?

736
00:29:17,764 --> 00:29:18,484
We forgot

737
00:29:18,484 --> 00:29:19,964
about Wang Dong and Ji Luchi.

738
00:29:21,044 --> 00:29:22,124
Let's go.

739
00:29:24,004 --> 00:29:25,004
Ji Luchi!

740
00:29:25,004 --> 00:29:26,484
What took you so long?

741
00:29:27,924 --> 00:29:29,324
How is it? We're not late, are we?

742
00:29:29,364 --> 00:29:30,084
You're not late.

743
00:29:31,084 --> 00:29:32,004
Is Wang Dong here yet?

744
00:29:32,004 --> 00:29:32,644
Not yet.

745
00:29:33,044 --> 00:29:34,164
What's the rush, then?

746
00:29:34,564 --> 00:29:35,164
You don't understand.

747
00:29:35,164 --> 00:29:36,164
Tactically,

748
00:29:36,164 --> 00:29:37,364
it's more imposing to come early.

749
00:29:39,604 --> 00:29:40,684
Ji Luchi!

750
00:29:49,164 --> 00:29:50,444
You must be Wang Dong.

751
00:29:55,564 --> 00:29:56,844
I am Wang Dong.

752
00:30:01,084 --> 00:30:02,004
So this is

753
00:30:02,004 --> 00:30:03,404
the tablemate who bullies you?

754
00:30:03,604 --> 00:30:04,164
Yes.

755
00:30:04,844 --> 00:30:06,404
She's scarier than Voldemort,

756
00:30:06,404 --> 00:30:07,644
and more horrifying than Godzilla?

757
00:30:08,004 --> 00:30:08,964
Yes, it's her.

758
00:30:09,124 --> 00:30:10,724
Didn't you always have an attitude?

759
00:30:10,804 --> 00:30:11,244
How could you

760
00:30:11,244 --> 00:30:12,604
be bullied by a little girl?

761
00:30:12,764 --> 00:30:13,724
Everything is

762
00:30:13,724 --> 00:30:14,764
afraid of something.

763
00:30:15,844 --> 00:30:17,324
Are you going to compete with me or not?

764
00:30:17,604 --> 00:30:18,404
Are you afraid?

765
00:30:18,644 --> 00:30:20,124
You should be.

766
00:30:20,124 --> 00:30:21,524
I've brought a secret weapon over.

767
00:30:21,524 --> 00:30:22,764
I'm sure I can defeat you.

768
00:30:32,524 --> 00:30:33,764
Ready.

769
00:30:34,164 --> 00:30:35,124
Start.

770
00:30:35,124 --> 00:30:45,684
- Wang Dong, you can do it!
- Wang Dong, you can do it!

771
00:30:45,684 --> 00:30:48,444
Ji Luchi, you can do it!

772
00:30:48,444 --> 00:30:50,684
- Wang Dong, you can do it!
- Wang Dong, you can do it!

773
00:30:51,244 --> 00:30:52,884
Ji Luchi, you can do it!

774
00:30:53,124 --> 00:30:54,484
It feels like Ji Luchi will win
this time.

775
00:30:54,724 --> 00:30:55,684
The race has just begun.

776
00:30:55,764 --> 00:30:57,364
The winner is still undefined.

777
00:30:57,404 --> 00:30:59,164
Are you really Ji Luchi's brother?

778
00:30:59,564 --> 00:31:00,484
I just think

779
00:31:00,484 --> 00:31:02,244
the victory doesn't do him any good.

780
00:31:03,004 --> 00:31:04,524
Being happy is better than being upset.

781
00:31:04,524 --> 00:31:05,484
As he pays so much effort,

782
00:31:05,484 --> 00:31:06,204
if he loses,

783
00:31:06,244 --> 00:31:07,644
will he be able to take it?

784
00:31:07,644 --> 00:31:08,884
He's not that vulnerable.

785
00:31:08,884 --> 00:31:10,244
Look, if Ji Luchi wins,

786
00:31:10,564 --> 00:31:11,444
Wang Dong will be upset

787
00:31:11,444 --> 00:31:12,284
and continue to bully him.

788
00:31:12,284 --> 00:31:13,124
It's a vicious cycle.

789
00:31:13,444 --> 00:31:14,564
If Ji Luchi loses,

790
00:31:14,564 --> 00:31:15,524
he'll keep asking

791
00:31:15,844 --> 00:31:17,244
to race with her.

792
00:31:17,524 --> 00:31:18,324
Over time,

793
00:31:18,324 --> 00:31:19,924
they might be friends by then.

794
00:31:19,924 --> 00:31:25,084
- Wang Dong, you can do it!
- Wang Dong, you can do it!

795
00:31:31,444 --> 00:31:32,004
Oh no.

796
00:31:32,084 --> 00:31:33,364
Wang Dong's car fell into the fountain.

797
00:31:37,604 --> 00:31:40,004
What should I do? It fell
into the middle of the fountain.

798
00:31:41,724 --> 00:31:43,124
The water is running too fast.

799
00:31:46,764 --> 00:31:47,484
Junxing,

800
00:31:47,884 --> 00:31:48,764
help her.

801
00:31:48,764 --> 00:31:49,684
How to get in there?

802
00:31:49,684 --> 00:31:50,284
Hmm.

803
00:31:55,484 --> 00:31:56,444
What are you doing?

804
00:31:56,884 --> 00:31:59,724
One, two, three.

805
00:32:03,044 --> 00:32:04,564
The fountain will stop for three seconds

806
00:32:05,044 --> 00:32:06,204
after going off in every 30 seconds.

807
00:32:06,484 --> 00:32:07,644
The next time when it stops,

808
00:32:07,644 --> 00:32:08,644
I'll rush in there.

809
00:32:09,204 --> 00:32:10,604
Let's endure hardships together.
I'll go with you.

810
00:32:11,164 --> 00:32:12,884
Okay, sure.

811
00:32:16,600 --> 00:32:19,840

Thank you,

822
00:32:59,444 --> 00:33:00,524
Brother Junxing and Sister Lin Xi.

823
00:33:00,844 --> 00:33:02,484
I thought I can't get it back.

824
00:33:02,884 --> 00:33:04,044
- You're welcome.
- You're welcome.

825
00:33:05,004 --> 00:33:07,884
But I wonder if it still works.

826
00:33:09,564 --> 00:33:10,244
Let me see.

827
00:33:15,844 --> 00:33:16,804
It's a minor problem.

828
00:33:16,804 --> 00:33:17,724
It's drenched.

829
00:33:17,724 --> 00:33:18,644
I'll repair it for you.

830
00:33:19,444 --> 00:33:19,964
Sure.

831
00:33:20,324 --> 00:33:21,764
I'll buy you fried chickens.

832
00:33:22,004 --> 00:33:23,084
Sure, it's a deal.

833
00:33:23,084 --> 00:33:23,484
Come.

834
00:33:23,924 --> 00:33:25,484
Let's make

835
00:33:25,484 --> 00:33:27,044
a pinky swear.

836
00:33:29,444 --> 00:33:30,644
Okay, I'll repair it for you later.

837
00:33:30,644 --> 00:33:31,124
Okay.

838
00:33:31,204 --> 00:33:33,004
The friendship between kids is
very simple.

839
00:33:33,284 --> 00:33:34,244
With a model car,

840
00:33:34,244 --> 00:33:35,164
and a bottle of milk,

841
00:33:35,164 --> 00:33:36,124
it can bring them together.

842
00:33:36,964 --> 00:33:37,764
You'll be satisfied

843
00:33:37,764 --> 00:33:39,484
with just a cup of milk tea as well.

844
00:33:42,884 --> 00:33:44,044
As I get to drink the milk tea,

845
00:33:44,044 --> 00:33:45,244
it's nothing to be upset about.

846
00:33:46,764 --> 00:33:48,764
By the way, I didn't know
what your favourite drink is.

847
00:33:49,324 --> 00:33:50,124
Take a guess.

848
00:33:50,724 --> 00:33:52,444
I guess it's Cola.

849
00:33:52,844 --> 00:33:53,684
At our previous gathering,

850
00:33:53,684 --> 00:33:54,604
I saw you drank it.

851
00:33:54,924 --> 00:33:56,524
That was because you only ordered Cola.

852
00:33:58,644 --> 00:33:59,484
Green tea?

853
00:33:59,484 --> 00:34:00,764
You seemed to know a lot
about tea leaves

854
00:34:00,764 --> 00:34:01,724
as I heard you talking about them.

855
00:34:02,564 --> 00:34:04,364
That's my dad's favourite drink.

856
00:34:06,604 --> 00:34:07,884
Then, what's your favourite drink?

857
00:34:13,564 --> 00:34:16,004
Don't tell me you like
to drink milk too.

858
00:34:17,204 --> 00:34:19,364
Actually, I like to drink mineral water.

859
00:34:19,564 --> 00:34:20,484
It's a simple

860
00:34:20,484 --> 00:34:21,364
and refreshing thirst-quencher.

861
00:34:23,884 --> 00:34:24,604
It's no fun.

862
00:34:31,604 --> 00:34:32,644
But now,

863
00:34:33,244 --> 00:34:34,164
I think

864
00:34:34,884 --> 00:34:36,084
a cup of milk tea is quite nice.

Hello?

873
00:35:06,004 --> 00:35:06,724
(What are you doing?)

874
00:35:06,724 --> 00:35:07,684
(Do you want to eat with me?)

875
00:35:07,684 --> 00:35:08,564
Never mind.

876
00:35:08,564 --> 00:35:09,404
I've already eaten.

877
00:35:10,004 --> 00:35:11,244
(Did everything go well today?)

878
00:35:11,444 --> 00:35:12,684
(Did Mr. Xie punish you?)

879
00:35:13,124 --> 00:35:14,124
Everything went well.

880
00:35:14,124 --> 00:35:16,284
Mr. Xie looks smart

881
00:35:16,284 --> 00:35:17,564
but he's actually gullible.

882
00:35:17,964 --> 00:35:18,724
I was wondering

883
00:35:18,724 --> 00:35:21,004
how he became the Dean of Student.

884
00:35:21,244 --> 00:35:22,324
(Just keep it down.)

885
00:35:22,324 --> 00:35:23,524
(Don't get caught by him again.)

886
00:35:24,444 --> 00:35:25,924
I'm a free man
when I'm not at school.

887
00:35:25,924 --> 00:35:27,244
I'm not afraid of getting caught by him.

888
00:35:37,764 --> 00:35:38,964
I'd like to have this.

889
00:35:39,284 --> 00:35:39,884
Sure.

890
00:35:40,124 --> 00:35:41,964
And this.

891
00:35:42,204 --> 00:35:42,644
Okay.

892
00:35:43,524 --> 00:35:44,404
And a plate of peanuts.

893
00:35:44,524 --> 00:35:44,964
Sure.

894
00:35:45,044 --> 00:35:46,764
Then, give me two bottles of white wine.

895
00:35:46,764 --> 00:35:47,324
Okay.

896
00:35:47,764 --> 00:35:48,804
That's all.

897
00:35:49,364 --> 00:35:49,684
Thank you.

898
00:35:49,684 --> 00:35:50,404
No problem.

899
00:35:50,404 --> 00:35:51,804
Beers will do for me.

900
00:35:52,164 --> 00:35:52,884
What are you thinking?

901
00:35:52,884 --> 00:35:54,004
It's not for you.

902
00:35:57,524 --> 00:35:59,204
Dude, give him a bottle of herbal tea.

903
00:35:59,444 --> 00:36:00,004
Sure.

904
00:36:01,564 --> 00:36:02,524
It's boring.

905
00:36:03,084 --> 00:36:04,724
My mom has already come.

906
00:36:04,724 --> 00:36:06,044
What do you want from me?

907
00:36:06,044 --> 00:36:07,964
I just want to eat and chat with you.

908
00:36:07,964 --> 00:36:08,804
Can't I do that?

909
00:36:09,764 --> 00:36:11,804
I think this is a trap.

910
00:36:29,084 --> 00:36:29,964
Let me ask you one thing.

911
00:36:30,564 --> 00:36:32,324
Where do you normally go after school?

912
00:36:33,164 --> 00:36:35,044
This is entrapment.

913
00:36:35,044 --> 00:36:36,764
This is out of your jurisdiction.

914
00:36:38,204 --> 00:36:39,404
I'll give you a free pass.

915
00:36:42,524 --> 00:36:43,524
At this moment,

916
00:36:44,124 --> 00:36:45,204
I'm not Mr. Xie.

917
00:36:46,644 --> 00:36:47,364
Are you for real?

918
00:36:48,644 --> 00:36:49,884
Do I look like I'm joking?

919
00:36:52,804 --> 00:36:54,364
Well, I'll tell you about it.

920
00:36:55,084 --> 00:36:58,284
After school, I'll go over the wall
and go to the cybercafe,

921
00:36:58,604 --> 00:36:59,644
to binge-watch American Drama,

922
00:37:00,884 --> 00:37:02,404
read internet novel,

923
00:37:03,124 --> 00:37:04,444
and stay up all night playing games.

924
00:37:06,324 --> 00:37:07,044
Stay up all night?

925
00:37:08,724 --> 00:37:09,724
You're out all night?

926
00:37:11,644 --> 00:37:12,764
Free pass, free pass,

927
00:37:12,764 --> 00:37:13,444
Mr. Xie.

928
00:37:23,164 --> 00:37:24,284
Do you go home on the weekends?

929
00:37:27,444 --> 00:37:28,404
No.

930
00:37:29,804 --> 00:37:30,844
Then, where do you go during holiday?

931
00:37:32,244 --> 00:37:33,444
I go anywhere I like.

932
00:37:33,924 --> 00:37:35,004
I'm the universe orphan.

933
00:37:35,004 --> 00:37:36,044
Just wander around the earth.

934
00:37:44,484 --> 00:37:45,604
Then, what do you eat
when you're hungry?

935
00:37:47,084 --> 00:37:48,964
Cup noodles, Malatang,

936
00:37:49,644 --> 00:37:50,484
and self-heating pot.

937
00:37:50,484 --> 00:37:51,684
If I'm lazy,

938
00:37:52,084 --> 00:37:54,004
I'll get by for a day with hard tack

939
00:37:54,004 --> 00:37:55,164
and mineral water.

940
00:37:57,964 --> 00:37:58,964
That's what you eat?

941
00:38:03,204 --> 00:38:04,444
Do you have enough living allowances?

942
00:38:05,724 --> 00:38:07,044
Don't you worry about this.

943
00:38:07,684 --> 00:38:08,764
Over years,

944
00:38:08,764 --> 00:38:09,724
I've been lacking everything

945
00:38:09,724 --> 00:38:10,524
except money.

946
00:38:10,524 --> 00:38:11,044
Look.

947
00:38:12,990 --> 00:38:14,380
(Payout RMB 65
Balance RMB 125,296.92)

948
00:38:21,460 --> 00:38:23,900
(Chunhui High School Student's Profile)

949
00:38:30,980 --> 00:38:32,880
(Mother Deceased)

950
00:38:32,880 --> 00:38:34,684
Qin Kai is quite pathetic.

951
00:38:34,964 --> 00:38:35,884
His mother passed away

952
00:38:35,884 --> 00:38:36,964
when he was five.

953
00:38:39,444 --> 00:38:40,324
What about his father?

954
00:38:40,764 --> 00:38:41,844
I heard

955
00:38:41,844 --> 00:38:43,004
that his father has remarried.

956
00:38:43,204 --> 00:38:44,324
He's always abroad.

957
00:38:44,684 --> 00:38:46,564
It's the secretary who attends
the parent-teacher meeting.

958
00:38:53,204 --> 00:38:54,404
You're quite rich.

959
00:38:57,644 --> 00:38:59,444
Are you going to confiscate my phone?

960
00:38:59,444 --> 00:39:00,764
You can't do that.

961
00:39:00,764 --> 00:39:01,644
I need to make a phone call.

962
00:39:02,524 --> 00:39:03,644
Who are you calling?

963
00:39:15,604 --> 00:39:16,364
Me.

964
00:39:18,444 --> 00:39:19,124
Okay.

965
00:39:19,484 --> 00:39:21,444
If your family is busy, I'll attend

966
00:39:21,884 --> 00:39:23,124
your parent-teacher meeting.

967
00:39:38,564 --> 00:39:40,364
You're taking advantage of me.

968
00:39:42,124 --> 00:39:43,204
You brat.

969
00:39:43,204 --> 00:39:44,284
What are you thinking?

970
00:39:44,724 --> 00:39:46,004
Just spare my concerns.

971
00:39:47,404 --> 00:39:48,244
Quickly finish it.

972
00:39:48,244 --> 00:39:49,564
And go back to the dorm.

973
00:39:49,964 --> 00:39:51,644
Don't always wander around out here.

974
00:39:52,244 --> 00:39:53,204
I tell you what.

975
00:39:53,684 --> 00:39:55,044
You'll be closely monitored.

976
00:39:55,044 --> 00:39:56,324
If you don't pick up my call,

977
00:39:56,764 --> 00:39:57,724
I'll kick your ass.

978
00:39:58,084 --> 00:39:58,684
I got it.

979
00:40:01,644 --> 00:40:02,324
Here, Mr. Xie.

980
00:40:20,244 --> 00:40:21,404
Are your clothes dry?

981
00:40:21,844 --> 00:40:23,324
Do you want to come
to my house and get changed?

982
00:40:23,324 --> 00:40:24,564
They're almost dry.

983
00:40:24,804 --> 00:40:25,764
I won't make it to school

984
00:40:25,764 --> 00:40:26,684
if I go to your house.

985
00:40:26,844 --> 00:40:27,924
Sister Lin Xi,

986
00:40:27,924 --> 00:40:29,764
you can sleep in my room.

987
00:40:30,084 --> 00:40:31,524
Weren't you asleep?

988
00:40:32,084 --> 00:40:33,324
I was.

989
00:40:33,324 --> 00:40:35,324
Didn't you hear me snoring?

990
00:40:36,244 --> 00:40:37,004
Geez.

991
00:40:37,364 --> 00:40:39,164
I think you just don't want to walk.

992
00:40:40,004 --> 00:40:42,164
I can't walk anymore.

993
00:40:43,404 --> 00:40:44,404
Sister Lin Xi,

994
00:40:44,764 --> 00:40:46,444
let's go home.

995
00:40:47,004 --> 00:40:47,844
Let's do it next time.

996
00:40:47,844 --> 00:40:49,364
Next time, we'll play
with the RC car together.

997
00:40:49,764 --> 00:40:52,364
We can also play with the RC airplane,

998
00:40:52,364 --> 00:40:53,004
RC tractor,

999
00:40:53,004 --> 00:40:54,524
and RC excavator.

1000
00:40:54,524 --> 00:40:55,764
And many more.

1001
00:40:56,684 --> 00:40:58,444
Junxing, I'm sleepy.

1002
00:40:59,324 --> 00:41:00,444
Hurry back.

1003
00:41:00,764 --> 00:41:01,604
I'll get going.

1004
00:41:02,164 --> 00:41:03,564
Stay safe on your way back to dorm.

1005
00:41:03,804 --> 00:41:05,284
Bye bye.

1006
00:41:06,844 --> 00:41:07,764
Don't forget this.

1007
00:41:08,644 --> 00:41:09,364
Bye bye.
