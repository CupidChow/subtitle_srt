There are only 100 days left
before the college entrance exam.

23
00:02:51,384 --> 00:02:54,984
You have been striving for a decade
just for this moment.

24
00:02:56,224 --> 00:02:58,784
Can you go to

25
00:02:59,024 --> 00:03:00,664
your great length

26
00:03:01,064 --> 00:03:02,184
and fight this time?

27
00:03:02,704 --> 00:03:03,744
- Yes.
- Yes.

28
00:03:05,184 --> 00:03:06,104
The college entrance exam

29
00:03:06,584 --> 00:03:09,624
is a single-plank bridge that
millions of students pass through.

30
00:03:10,424 --> 00:03:13,104
Only the competent and brave ones

31
00:03:13,584 --> 00:03:14,864
can breakthrough the crowd

32
00:03:15,144 --> 00:03:16,544
and move forward further.

33
00:03:17,864 --> 00:03:19,264
Are you confident about this?

34
00:03:19,544 --> 00:03:21,344
- Yes.
- Yes.

35
00:03:23,104 --> 00:03:24,624
In the last one hundred days,

36
00:03:25,184 --> 00:03:27,384
the victory is right before you.

37
00:03:28,624 --> 00:03:32,224
I must conquer this challenge.

38
00:03:32,224 --> 00:03:41,784
- I must conquer this challenge.
- I must conquer this challenge.

39
00:03:41,784 --> 00:03:43,544
In order to ensure sufficient study time

40
00:03:43,544 --> 00:03:44,704
and create a good learning atmosphere

41
00:03:44,704 --> 00:03:45,784
for the sake of
the sound study experience,

42
00:03:45,784 --> 00:03:46,904
from March 1st,

43
00:03:46,904 --> 00:03:47,584
Grade 12 students

44
00:03:47,584 --> 00:03:49,624
will participate in the 800-meter run
at 6:00 every morning.

45
00:03:49,744 --> 00:03:50,784
In that case,

46
00:03:50,784 --> 00:03:52,224
we have to wake up at five.

47
00:03:52,704 --> 00:03:53,504
Not only that,

48
00:03:53,504 --> 00:03:54,184
self-study sessions

49
00:03:54,184 --> 00:03:56,144
are extended to 10:30 p.m.

50
00:03:56,424 --> 00:03:58,504
The bathhouse will be closed at 11 p.m.

51
00:03:58,504 --> 00:03:59,664
We need five minutes to walk there

52
00:03:59,664 --> 00:04:00,624
and another five minutes
to wait in line.

53
00:04:01,144 --> 00:04:02,424
That means we only have twenty minutes
to take shower.

54
00:04:02,704 --> 00:04:03,704
This can't be real.

55
00:04:04,464 --> 00:04:05,224
The new rules of Grade 12

56
00:04:05,224 --> 00:04:06,704
have almost drained me off.

57
00:04:07,104 --> 00:04:08,144
This 100-days rules

58
00:04:08,144 --> 00:04:09,944
definitely terminate my life
straight away.

59
00:05:25,024 --> 00:05:25,744
Are you ready?

60
00:05:26,184 --> 00:05:26,864
Ready.

61
00:05:27,744 --> 00:05:28,744
All right. Let's wrap up here.

62
00:05:38,304 --> 00:05:39,944
Was that a battle royale?

63
00:05:40,704 --> 00:05:42,024
It seems this is their very chance

64
00:05:42,024 --> 00:05:43,224
to shower every three days.

65
00:05:46,024 --> 00:05:47,664
Likewise, it is our very chance
to shower every two days too.

66
00:05:48,064 --> 00:05:49,264
Why are we still dawdling here?

67
00:05:53,704 --> 00:05:54,904
- Let's go.
- Let's go.

68
00:06:02,504 --> 00:06:03,024
Gosh.

69
00:06:03,024 --> 00:06:04,144
Only five minutes left.

70
00:06:04,144 --> 00:06:05,104
Can we take the shower in time?

71
00:06:06,784 --> 00:06:07,704
Write my name for me.

72
00:06:09,184 --> 00:06:10,264
We have less than five minutes.

73
00:06:11,024 --> 00:06:11,664
What do we do now?

74
00:06:11,664 --> 00:06:13,024
Perhaps we can't shower today.

75
00:06:15,824 --> 00:06:16,504
- Go in.
- Go in.

76
00:06:22,040 --> 00:06:22,640
It's cold.

77
00:06:22,640 --> 00:06:24,000
- There is no hot water.
- It's cold.

78
00:06:36,740 --> 00:06:39,860
(Letter of Acceptance)

79
00:06:41,184 --> 00:06:41,944
Congratulations to you.

80
00:06:46,184 --> 00:06:46,984
Thank you, Mr. Xie.

81
00:06:48,624 --> 00:06:49,504
I shall take my leave.

82
00:07:01,464 --> 00:07:02,504
Again,

83
00:07:02,864 --> 00:07:04,544
I only got to shower
right before the bathhouse closed.

84
00:07:05,224 --> 00:07:06,944
I haven't had a shower for three days.

85
00:07:07,264 --> 00:07:08,544
I stink.

86
00:07:09,064 --> 00:07:10,104
I thought I have washed myself clean

87
00:07:10,464 --> 00:07:11,464
but it doesn't seem so.

88
00:07:11,864 --> 00:07:12,904
I envy you so much.

89
00:07:13,184 --> 00:07:14,304
You can enjoy bathing at home.

90
00:07:20,664 --> 00:07:22,944
I never expected
that having a proper shower

91
00:07:23,344 --> 00:07:24,624
would be the ultimate goal

92
00:07:24,624 --> 00:07:26,104
when we are in Grade 12.

93
00:07:28,824 --> 00:07:30,544
Here, I got you some snacks.

94
00:07:33,824 --> 00:07:35,464
I smell a rat.

95
00:07:36,344 --> 00:07:38,184
What has happened?

96
00:07:39,944 --> 00:07:40,944
Nothing.

97
00:07:41,464 --> 00:07:43,584
It is just that I'm the gold medalist
in International Olympiad in Informatics

98
00:07:43,584 --> 00:07:44,944
and I got the guaranteed admission
to Jinghua University.

99
00:07:45,784 --> 00:07:46,624
Seriously?

100
00:07:46,624 --> 00:07:47,624
Are you serious?

101
00:07:47,624 --> 00:07:48,944
Did you get the guaranteed
admission to Jinghua University?

102
00:07:48,944 --> 00:07:50,344
Yes, I did.

103
00:07:50,344 --> 00:07:51,464
But can you please calm down?

104
00:07:51,580 --> 00:07:53,620
(Letter of Acceptance)

105
00:07:55,304 --> 00:07:56,184
Congratulations.

106
00:07:56,504 --> 00:07:57,504
You got what you wanted.

107
00:07:57,504 --> 00:07:58,144
Thank you.

108
00:07:58,664 --> 00:07:59,744
I'm one step ahead now.

109
00:08:00,024 --> 00:08:01,104
I shall wait for you.

110
00:08:02,344 --> 00:08:03,064
Wait.

111
00:08:03,464 --> 00:08:04,264
If you don't have

112
00:08:04,264 --> 00:08:05,304
to sit for college entrance exam now,

113
00:08:05,824 --> 00:08:07,024
will you still come to school?

114
00:08:10,944 --> 00:08:12,624
We promised that friends
should always be together.

115
00:08:13,344 --> 00:08:14,904
The one who falls behind is a dog.

116
00:08:15,904 --> 00:08:16,624
Yes,

117
00:08:17,144 --> 00:08:17,904
he is real a dog.

118
00:08:20,344 --> 00:08:22,264
I think you are the ones
who fall behind.

119
00:08:24,664 --> 00:08:26,184
Gosh, we will bite you.

120
00:08:33,384 --> 00:08:33,944
All right.

121
00:08:34,464 --> 00:08:35,664
As for the exponential function,

122
00:08:36,104 --> 00:08:38,024
the line shows a blow-up growth

123
00:08:38,264 --> 00:08:40,264
under certain conditions.

124
00:08:40,704 --> 00:08:42,584
This is it, the blow-up.

125
00:08:43,744 --> 00:08:44,544
What sound was that?

126
00:08:48,544 --> 00:08:49,184
Who did that?

127
00:08:49,824 --> 00:08:50,984
How many times do I have to repeat this?

128
00:08:51,384 --> 00:08:52,944
Never boil the water in the classroom

129
00:08:53,184 --> 00:08:55,304
and never use such an unqualified
immersion heater.

130
00:08:58,824 --> 00:09:01,304
Gosh, the hot water is gone.

131
00:09:01,744 --> 00:09:02,784
The flask is gone too.

132
00:09:19,064 --> 00:09:19,864
This is all we have.

133
00:09:20,464 --> 00:09:21,344
No more left.

134
00:09:26,544 --> 00:09:27,264
Gosh.

135
00:09:27,264 --> 00:09:28,904
My hand is warmer than the water.

136
00:09:30,264 --> 00:09:31,424
Maybe we don't wash our hair today.

137
00:09:31,424 --> 00:09:32,864
We can wash it in the bathhouse
tomorrow.

138
00:09:33,224 --> 00:09:34,184
There may not be a place for us

139
00:09:34,184 --> 00:09:35,304
in the bathhouse.

140
00:09:35,904 --> 00:09:37,264
Mianmian, it has been four days.

141
00:09:37,264 --> 00:09:37,864
I stink

142
00:09:37,864 --> 00:09:39,104
if I don't wash my hair.

143
00:09:40,944 --> 00:09:41,504
Fine.

144
00:09:42,304 --> 00:09:43,624
Washing my hair with warm water

145
00:09:43,984 --> 00:09:45,704
isn't something difficult for me.

146
00:09:46,384 --> 00:09:47,024
Let's do it now.

147
00:09:53,304 --> 00:09:54,104
Ready.

148
00:09:54,744 --> 00:09:58,424
- Three, two, one.
- Three, two, one.

149
00:10:00,904 --> 00:10:01,704
Lin Xi.

150
00:10:01,704 --> 00:10:02,944
The water is cold.

151
00:10:08,584 --> 00:10:09,704
It is really chilly.

152
00:10:10,304 --> 00:10:11,784
Why do I find my scalp itchy?

153
00:10:12,464 --> 00:10:13,384
Mine too.

154
00:10:24,184 --> 00:10:24,984
Take the medicine.

155
00:10:32,104 --> 00:10:32,544
Here.

156
00:10:33,624 --> 00:10:34,624
Take the medicine.

157
00:10:45,824 --> 00:10:46,864
We can't let the condition go worse.

158
00:10:47,304 --> 00:10:48,064
We must figure something out.

159
00:10:50,944 --> 00:10:51,704
I need to talk to my dad.

160
00:11:02,184 --> 00:11:03,184
How was it?

161
00:11:04,104 --> 00:11:06,024
I can tell that he has failed
from how he looks now.

162
00:11:11,504 --> 00:11:12,904
He was holding out on me.

163
00:11:13,464 --> 00:11:15,064
I requested more shower time.

164
00:11:15,504 --> 00:11:16,264
He said we shouldn't
be particular about this

165
00:11:16,264 --> 00:11:17,264
when the college entrance exam
is around the corner.

166
00:11:17,744 --> 00:11:19,024
We were not on the same page.

167
00:11:19,744 --> 00:11:21,424
Perhaps we can pen him in

168
00:11:21,424 --> 00:11:22,304
after the meeting.

169
00:11:23,584 --> 00:11:24,264
It won't work out either.

170
00:11:24,584 --> 00:11:26,464
My dad won't listen to others
unless they act tough against him.

171
00:11:26,744 --> 00:11:27,704
I have never succeeded

172
00:11:27,704 --> 00:11:28,904
when I asked something of him.

173
00:11:29,384 --> 00:11:31,184
Except for my mother who roars at him,

174
00:11:31,504 --> 00:11:32,424
he will obey it without hesitation.

175
00:11:33,584 --> 00:11:35,184
But we aren't your mum.

176
00:11:39,064 --> 00:11:39,864
Perhaps

177
00:11:41,264 --> 00:11:42,584
we have to play hardball.

178
00:11:43,184 --> 00:11:43,864
How?

179
00:11:45,144 --> 00:11:47,224
We must seize a chance
for using the bathhouse freely.

180
00:11:48,024 --> 00:11:50,184
We will occupy the bathhouse

181
00:11:50,504 --> 00:11:52,504
and the boiler room,
then turn on the waterworks.

182
00:11:53,104 --> 00:11:53,944
So all students

183
00:11:53,944 --> 00:11:55,464
can enjoy the hot shower.

184
00:11:58,384 --> 00:11:59,704
You are making this big.

185
00:11:59,704 --> 00:12:01,024
What if we get caught?

186
00:12:02,344 --> 00:12:03,184
What do you think?

187
00:12:04,384 --> 00:12:05,224
I'm fine if anything happens.

188
00:12:06,264 --> 00:12:09,064
We will end up getting in trouble
and receiving demerit tops.

189
00:12:10,824 --> 00:12:12,624
What about you, Xie Ang?

190
00:12:14,744 --> 00:12:16,024
Indeed, I don't have the guts to do so.

191
00:12:16,424 --> 00:12:17,184
My dad will probably break my leg

192
00:12:17,184 --> 00:12:18,704
if I stand up to him.

193
00:12:21,544 --> 00:12:22,144
Nevertheless,

194
00:12:22,784 --> 00:12:23,904
for the sake of Mianmian,

195
00:12:24,744 --> 00:12:25,584
I must stand up

196
00:12:25,984 --> 00:12:28,144
and be a righteous hero to go against
the unfair.

197
00:12:34,544 --> 00:12:35,584
Monitoring room, broadcasting studio,

198
00:12:35,584 --> 00:12:36,624
boiler room and the bathhouse.

199
00:12:37,144 --> 00:12:38,024
These four places

200
00:12:38,024 --> 00:12:39,264
are our battlefields.

201
00:12:44,464 --> 00:12:45,504
What do you think?

202
00:12:46,144 --> 00:12:46,984
- Okay.
- Okay.

203
00:12:47,344 --> 00:12:48,504
Let's spread out and conquer.

204
00:13:15,184 --> 00:13:16,544
It's already 10:15 p.m.

205
00:13:21,064 --> 00:13:21,824
Whatever.

206
00:13:24,784 --> 00:13:25,704
Who's that?

207
00:13:30,624 --> 00:13:32,304
Hey! Students, don't fool around.

208
00:13:41,102 --> 00:13:42,702
Why do so many cameras glitch
at the same time?

209
00:13:44,504 --> 00:13:45,144
Sir.

210
00:13:46,384 --> 00:13:47,984
Erm...Mr. Xie said

211
00:13:47,984 --> 00:13:49,944
the cameras at the boy's dorm
have failed.

212
00:13:49,944 --> 00:13:51,024
It's a security issue.

213
00:13:51,264 --> 00:13:52,704
Can you please go check it out?

214
00:13:54,344 --> 00:13:56,824
Sure, I will go now.

215
00:13:57,024 --> 00:13:57,784
Thank you.

216
00:13:57,784 --> 00:13:58,584
You are welcome.

217
00:14:03,784 --> 00:14:04,584
Done.

218
00:14:35,064 --> 00:14:35,784
Sir.

219
00:14:37,304 --> 00:14:37,864
Yes?

220
00:14:38,744 --> 00:14:39,824
Well,

221
00:14:41,024 --> 00:14:42,384
the staff of the logistics department

222
00:14:42,664 --> 00:14:43,704
asked me to relay to you

223
00:14:43,704 --> 00:14:44,744
an important message.

224
00:14:45,304 --> 00:14:45,904
What's it?

225
00:14:49,104 --> 00:14:50,664
I came in a hurry and I forgot about it.

226
00:14:50,944 --> 00:14:51,664
You forgot?

227
00:14:52,024 --> 00:14:53,344
Allow me to ask them again.

228
00:14:57,864 --> 00:14:59,144
What is with that kid?

229
00:15:03,704 --> 00:15:05,064
That was close.

230
00:15:07,064 --> 00:15:07,584
I can do it

231
00:15:07,584 --> 00:15:08,544
without your help.

232
00:15:10,904 --> 00:15:11,784
Are you still mad?

233
00:15:14,144 --> 00:15:15,104
Why would I be mad?

234
00:15:58,424 --> 00:15:59,384
This is hilarious.

235
00:16:20,064 --> 00:16:20,664
Hello.

236
00:16:21,704 --> 00:16:22,544
Where have you gone?

237
00:16:23,944 --> 00:16:25,464
A teacher asked for me.

238
00:16:25,784 --> 00:16:26,344
Why do you call me?

239
00:16:26,904 --> 00:16:27,784
There is a post in the school forum

240
00:16:27,784 --> 00:16:29,664
saying that the shower time will
be extended today.

241
00:16:30,064 --> 00:16:31,744
"Rub-a-dub-dub" will be played as a cue

242
00:16:31,744 --> 00:16:33,624
to extend the shower time
by half an hour.

243
00:16:33,624 --> 00:16:34,824
Do you know about this?

244
00:16:36,104 --> 00:16:36,864
I heard that too.

245
00:16:37,944 --> 00:16:39,824
Do you think it is a prank?

246
00:16:41,024 --> 00:16:41,984
I don't think so.

247
00:16:42,584 --> 00:16:43,864
Do you think they can make it?

248
00:16:43,980 --> 00:16:44,820
(Enter Passcode)

249
00:16:47,944 --> 00:16:49,064
Where is my handphone?

250
00:16:55,344 --> 00:16:56,944
Did I leave it inside?

251
00:17:05,184 --> 00:17:05,904
Lin Xi.

252
00:17:06,544 --> 00:17:07,784
What is the passcode
of your mum's phone?

253
00:17:08,344 --> 00:17:08,984
My mum?

254
00:17:09,904 --> 00:17:11,344
The birthday of Andy Lau.

255
00:17:11,744 --> 00:17:13,104
She is crazy about Andy Lau.

256
00:17:16,224 --> 00:17:17,384
Blimey.

257
00:17:17,384 --> 00:17:18,224
What are the odds?

258
00:17:19,184 --> 00:17:20,464
When is Andy Lau's birthday?

259
00:17:21,384 --> 00:17:22,584
Zero nine two seven.

260
00:17:23,024 --> 00:17:24,224
Why do you ask this?

261
00:17:24,340 --> 00:17:26,340
(Enter Passcode)

262
00:17:29,944 --> 00:17:31,664
Didn't you ask me if they would make it?

263
00:17:32,104 --> 00:17:32,904
I think they can.

264
00:17:33,384 --> 00:17:34,024
I'm hanging up.

265
00:17:41,900 --> 00:17:43,980
(Date and Time)

266
00:17:45,780 --> 00:17:48,300
(Set Time and Date by default)

267
00:17:58,544 --> 00:17:59,544
It is not inside though.

268
00:18:02,024 --> 00:18:02,864
Gosh, it is here.

269
00:18:03,104 --> 00:18:04,384
What's wrong with my eyes?

270
00:18:04,784 --> 00:18:06,264
Gosh.

271
00:18:08,424 --> 00:18:10,064
Why is it still early now?

272
00:18:10,064 --> 00:18:11,064
Argh.

273
00:18:11,304 --> 00:18:13,024
Everything is done until you do.

274
00:18:13,744 --> 00:18:14,544
No worries.

275
00:18:14,544 --> 00:18:15,464
Let me show you
how I handle the juniors

276
00:18:15,464 --> 00:18:16,424
with my beauty.

277
00:18:28,384 --> 00:18:29,504
No one is here?

278
00:18:30,984 --> 00:18:32,184
They have lost the chance to appreciate
my handsome face.

279
00:18:52,584 --> 00:18:53,424
It is the cue.

280
00:18:53,424 --> 00:18:54,464
So, it is true that the shower time

281
00:18:54,464 --> 00:18:55,064
will be extended.

College entrance exam is nearing.

Well done, brats.

316

Why don't you

317
00:20:27,464 --> 00:20:28,864
play 'Magic' instead?

318
00:20:29,784 --> 00:20:30,584
Look at them.

319
00:20:31,264 --> 00:20:31,984
They are so happy.

Thanks to you.

321
00:20:35,264 --> 00:20:37,544
Mr. Xie, we can't take the credit.

322
00:20:38,104 --> 00:20:40,024
But, we did this
for the sake of all.

323
00:20:40,024 --> 00:20:41,304
For the sake of all?

324
00:20:41,704 --> 00:20:42,264
Stop.

325
00:20:48,544 --> 00:20:49,504
Fess up.

326
00:20:50,184 --> 00:20:51,344
Who started this?

327
00:20:53,104 --> 00:20:53,744
It is me.

328
00:20:54,384 --> 00:20:55,344
It is my idea.

329
00:20:56,464 --> 00:20:57,504
I plugged off the power supply
of the surveillance cameras.

330
00:20:58,024 --> 00:20:59,304
I stole the key of the boiler room.

331
00:21:00,704 --> 00:21:01,704
I played the song as the cue.

332

You!

333
00:21:04,664 --> 00:21:05,544

335
00:21:07,824 --> 00:21:09,104
How dare you

336
00:21:09,104 --> 00:21:10,224
do such nonsense in school!

337
00:21:12,064 --> 00:21:13,624
And yet you aren't ashamed
of your behavior.

338
00:21:14,024 --> 00:21:15,744
Go run rounds.

339
00:21:15,744 --> 00:21:16,944
- Yes, Mr. Xie.
- Yes, Mr. Xie.

340
00:21:17,504 --> 00:21:18,744
Run quickly.

341
00:21:18,944 --> 00:21:19,464
Be quick.

342
00:21:22,424 --> 00:21:23,784
Faster.

343
00:21:29,104 --> 00:21:29,744
It has

344
00:21:30,144 --> 00:21:31,104
been a long time

345
00:21:31,104 --> 00:21:32,624
since I smelt the scent of cape jasmine
from my hair.

346
00:21:33,464 --> 00:21:35,024
We must be the fairies

347
00:21:35,024 --> 00:21:37,304
in the elves' garden.

348
00:21:37,664 --> 00:21:39,064
Excuse me.

349
00:21:39,744 --> 00:21:40,184
Sorry.

350
00:21:40,184 --> 00:21:41,304
I'm sorry.

351
00:21:47,904 --> 00:21:49,944
Who do you think

352
00:21:49,944 --> 00:21:51,144
have done a great deed like such today?

353
00:21:51,144 --> 00:21:51,864
And no name is left

354
00:21:51,864 --> 00:21:53,024
after doing this heroic deed.

355
00:21:53,304 --> 00:21:54,704
I can't show my appreciation though.

356
00:21:55,544 --> 00:21:57,264
Doing good deeds

357
00:21:57,264 --> 00:21:58,824
without seeking recognition.

358
00:21:58,824 --> 00:22:00,624
This is how big heroes
in the Kungfu novels do.

359
00:22:01,664 --> 00:22:02,584
Well,

360
00:22:02,584 --> 00:22:03,344
if I meet

361
00:22:03,344 --> 00:22:04,824
the hero,

362
00:22:05,384 --> 00:22:06,544
I will...

363
00:22:06,544 --> 00:22:08,024
You give your hand to him.

364
00:22:08,464 --> 00:22:10,264
This is how beauties
in the Kungfu novels do.

365
00:22:11,184 --> 00:22:12,704
It depends on whether he is
good-looking or not.

366
00:22:13,504 --> 00:22:14,544
I will consider this if he is handsome.

367
00:22:15,144 --> 00:22:16,064
Geez, Jiang Yimian.

368
00:22:16,064 --> 00:22:17,544
Mianmian.

369
00:22:17,784 --> 00:22:19,784
Mr. Xie is punishing the boys
from your class

370
00:22:19,784 --> 00:22:21,024
at the stadium now.

371
00:22:21,024 --> 00:22:22,944
I think they're the ones
behind today's incident.

372
00:22:29,824 --> 00:22:31,144
Do you admit that you are wrong?

373
00:22:31,424 --> 00:22:32,624
- No.
- No.

374
00:22:33,304 --> 00:22:34,664
You can't rest then.

375
00:22:34,664 --> 00:22:35,824
Keep on running.

376
00:22:38,224 --> 00:22:40,584
Think twice before answering me.

377
00:22:40,584 --> 00:22:42,064
Do you admit that you are wrong?

378
00:22:42,504 --> 00:22:43,944
- No.
- No.

379
00:22:43,944 --> 00:22:44,504
Fine.

380
00:22:44,864 --> 00:22:46,904
I will stay with you here tonight.

381
00:22:47,584 --> 00:22:48,424
Faster.

382
00:22:53,944 --> 00:22:56,064
Mr. Xie, why do you punish them?

383
00:22:56,064 --> 00:22:57,664
They did that for everyone's sake
though.

384
00:22:57,664 --> 00:22:58,504
That's right.

385
00:22:58,504 --> 00:22:59,864
They did that for the students

386
00:22:59,864 --> 00:23:00,744
and it is understandable.

387
00:23:01,424 --> 00:23:02,144
Fine.

388
00:23:02,984 --> 00:23:04,504
Even though they did that
for good reasons,

389
00:23:04,864 --> 00:23:06,344
they still did it in the wrong way.

390
00:23:07,464 --> 00:23:09,304
You can come to the teachers

391
00:23:09,704 --> 00:23:10,864
if you have doubts about the rules.

392
00:23:11,264 --> 00:23:13,144
Yet you are now defending those

393
00:23:13,144 --> 00:23:14,504
who violated the school rules.

394
00:23:15,944 --> 00:23:16,784
Mr. Xie,

395
00:23:17,344 --> 00:23:18,664
since students who have done wrong
should be punished,

396
00:23:18,664 --> 00:23:20,264
you should punish us too.

397
00:23:20,624 --> 00:23:22,184
I'm part of them

398
00:23:22,184 --> 00:23:22,944
as I went for the shower too.

399
00:23:26,384 --> 00:23:28,144
Mr. Xie, I'm part of them too.

400
00:23:30,184 --> 00:23:31,344
- Mr. Xie.
- Mr. Xie.

401
00:23:38,304 --> 00:23:40,064
I never expected you're so united.

402
00:23:40,544 --> 00:23:41,304
Go ahead.

403
00:23:41,304 --> 00:23:42,824
Run quickly.

404
00:23:43,664 --> 00:23:44,504
Faster.

405
00:23:51,704 --> 00:23:52,744
What are you doing here?

406
00:23:52,864 --> 00:23:53,504
Why?

407
00:23:53,744 --> 00:23:55,224
Can't we take the blame with you

408
00:23:55,224 --> 00:23:56,704
for what you did for us?

409
00:23:57,464 --> 00:23:58,384
Of course, you can.

410
00:23:58,584 --> 00:23:59,584
What is wrong with the two of them?

411
00:23:59,944 --> 00:24:00,944
No idea.

412
00:24:02,824 --> 00:24:03,744
Well done.

413
00:24:03,744 --> 00:24:05,184
You have done such a great deed.

414
00:24:05,664 --> 00:24:06,864
Do I look handsome?

415
00:24:07,504 --> 00:24:09,224
I don't think so.

416
00:24:09,224 --> 00:24:10,584
But you are sweaty.

417
00:24:11,024 --> 00:24:12,384
Are you despising me?

418
00:24:13,184 --> 00:24:14,224
You are the most handsome one.

419
00:24:17,824 --> 00:24:19,384
Why do they run so fast?

420
00:24:21,824 --> 00:24:22,504
Are you tired?

421
00:24:22,824 --> 00:24:23,424
No.

422
00:24:29,384 --> 00:24:30,184
Mr. Wu.

423
00:24:30,984 --> 00:24:31,744
Mr. Xie.

424
00:24:35,584 --> 00:24:36,424
Look at them.

425
00:24:37,144 --> 00:24:39,104
They are sweating now after the shower.

426
00:24:39,384 --> 00:24:40,704
I wonder what they ask for.

427
00:24:42,464 --> 00:24:43,464
They are young

428
00:24:43,464 --> 00:24:44,384
and sometimes, they do something

429
00:24:44,384 --> 00:24:45,664
that turns out in vain.

430
00:24:48,224 --> 00:24:49,224
What do you mean?

431
00:24:51,664 --> 00:24:52,224
I mean,

432
00:24:52,224 --> 00:24:53,464
these naughty students

433
00:24:53,464 --> 00:24:54,824
should be punished

434
00:24:54,824 --> 00:24:56,264
and given demerits,

435
00:24:56,264 --> 00:24:57,664
so that they can learn a lesson.

436
00:24:57,904 --> 00:24:58,704
Well, enough.

437
00:24:58,944 --> 00:25:00,304
Don't try to trick me.

438
00:25:01,224 --> 00:25:03,664
Gosh, why would I trick you, Mr. Xie?

439
00:25:04,064 --> 00:25:04,824
Think about this.

440
00:25:05,344 --> 00:25:06,464
They will leave the school

441
00:25:06,464 --> 00:25:07,784
after graduation.

442
00:25:08,064 --> 00:25:09,424
As for us, our comradeship

443
00:25:09,424 --> 00:25:10,544
will carry on here.

444
00:25:11,504 --> 00:25:13,064
They remind me

445
00:25:13,064 --> 00:25:14,544
of my old school times.

446
00:25:14,824 --> 00:25:16,584
I did something more ridiculous
than they did.

447
00:25:17,024 --> 00:25:18,184
Look what you've said.

448
00:25:18,464 --> 00:25:20,024
I have experienced
a thrilling youth too.

449
00:25:27,624 --> 00:25:29,744
Fine, I will let them slide.

450
00:25:30,064 --> 00:25:30,944
Tell them

451
00:25:30,944 --> 00:25:32,904
that the shower time will be extended
by half an hour.

452
00:25:35,064 --> 00:25:36,024
Thank you so much, Mr. Xie.

453
00:25:37,784 --> 00:25:38,664
Stop running.

454
00:25:39,464 --> 00:25:40,384
Come over here.

455
00:25:42,464 --> 00:25:44,304
I have an announcement to make.

456
00:25:46,544 --> 00:25:47,664
Mr. Xie said

457
00:25:48,104 --> 00:25:50,264
your shower time

458
00:25:51,464 --> 00:25:52,544
will be extended by half an hour.

459
00:26:17,504 --> 00:26:18,664
Gao Yunlang.

460
00:26:19,104 --> 00:26:20,424
Do you want to pick on me?

461
00:26:22,184 --> 00:26:23,424
You want to pick on me, huh?

462
00:26:29,624 --> 00:26:31,904
Ji Junxing.

463
00:26:32,144 --> 00:26:33,064
Gao Yunlang...

464
00:26:33,064 --> 00:26:34,984
Gao Yunlang and Chen Mo
are fighting now.

465
00:26:34,984 --> 00:26:36,144
What?

466
00:26:36,384 --> 00:26:37,224
That's impossible.

467
00:26:37,224 --> 00:26:37,704
What has happened?

468
00:26:37,704 --> 00:26:38,784
Take us there.

469
00:26:38,784 --> 00:26:40,064
What is wrong with them?

470
00:26:41,264 --> 00:26:42,704
Why do they fight?

471
00:26:50,944 --> 00:26:52,104
Hey, what is wrong with you two?

472
00:26:52,344 --> 00:26:53,424
You are like dear brothers.

473
00:26:53,424 --> 00:26:54,544
How come you fight each other
out of a sudden?

474
00:26:54,544 --> 00:26:55,664
We are not dear brothers.

475
00:26:55,864 --> 00:26:56,464
Are you done?

476
00:26:56,864 --> 00:26:57,864
When is this all going to stop?

477
00:26:59,784 --> 00:27:00,624
Enough.

478
00:27:01,304 --> 00:27:02,544
Calm yourselves down.

479
00:27:06,184 --> 00:27:07,024
What about this?

480
00:27:07,464 --> 00:27:08,144
All conflicts can be solved

481
00:27:08,144 --> 00:27:09,104
after having a meal.

482
00:27:09,584 --> 00:27:10,984
Let's go and take some supper later.

483
00:27:11,024 --> 00:27:12,144
You need to sit up and
put the world to right.

484
00:27:12,384 --> 00:27:14,024
I doubt if he wants
to eat supper with us.

485
00:27:14,384 --> 00:27:15,664
Why do you say so?

486
00:27:15,984 --> 00:27:17,024
How come Chen Mo

487
00:27:17,024 --> 00:27:18,664
isn't willing to eat supper with us?

488
00:27:25,744 --> 00:27:26,784
He is leaving for Jingzhou

489
00:27:26,784 --> 00:27:27,704
with his parents.

490
00:27:28,744 --> 00:27:29,944
The East Gate Squad
is going to break up.

491
00:27:29,944 --> 00:27:31,104
There is no need to go
for supper anymore.

492
00:27:34,864 --> 00:27:36,024
Are you leaving for Jingzhou?

493
00:27:36,264 --> 00:27:37,544
Why is it a sudden decision?

494
00:27:41,264 --> 00:27:42,304
When are you leaving?

495
00:27:43,704 --> 00:27:44,664
Tomorrow afternoon.

496
00:28:04,904 --> 00:28:05,584
Xie Ang.

497
00:28:10,264 --> 00:28:11,664
Let them work it out for themselves.

498
00:28:15,224 --> 00:28:15,944
Gao Yunlang.

499
00:28:15,944 --> 00:28:16,504
Don't drag me.

500
00:28:16,504 --> 00:28:17,264
Do you still want a fight?

501
00:28:18,304 --> 00:28:19,504
Do you think I'm willing to leave?

502
00:28:19,504 --> 00:28:21,264
Whether you are willing or not,
the truth is

503
00:28:21,264 --> 00:28:22,384
you are leaving.

504
00:28:22,904 --> 00:28:24,224
My parents specially made a trip home
to force me to leave.

505
00:28:24,224 --> 00:28:25,304
I just couldn't do anything.

506
00:28:25,304 --> 00:28:26,464
Why didn't you tell me earlier?

507
00:28:29,024 --> 00:28:30,344
Had you told me earlier,

508
00:28:31,104 --> 00:28:31,984
at least we could've

509
00:28:31,984 --> 00:28:32,944
finished the football match footage left

510
00:28:32,944 --> 00:28:34,144
and cleared all the game levels
we failed before.

511
00:28:35,224 --> 00:28:35,904
I'm sorry.

512
00:28:37,904 --> 00:28:38,864
Don't be.

513
00:28:40,024 --> 00:28:41,664
Because you never treat me
as your friend.

514
00:28:43,104 --> 00:28:44,384
I'm leaving at 2:00 p.m. tomorrow.

515
00:28:53,504 --> 00:28:54,464
Good luck with the rest
of your journey, then.

516
00:29:04,384 --> 00:29:05,464
(Is this Gao Yunlang?)

517
00:29:05,584 --> 00:29:06,584
(You have a parcel.)

518
00:29:06,584 --> 00:29:07,824
(Please sign for it.)

519
00:29:14,900 --> 00:29:17,460
(Gao Yunlang)

520
00:29:47,864 --> 00:29:48,544
(Gao Yunlang.)

521
00:29:50,064 --> 00:29:52,624
(This is the first time
I write to you.)

522
00:29:54,224 --> 00:29:56,984
(I never expected that I would say
goodbye to you in this way.)

523
00:30:02,224 --> 00:30:03,744
(We grew up together
since we were little.)

524
00:30:04,664 --> 00:30:05,864
(I just can't deal with)

525
00:30:06,864 --> 00:30:08,544
(the sudden parting of ours.)

526
00:30:09,824 --> 00:30:11,504
(It is my fault for not biding
a proper goodbye)

527
00:30:12,144 --> 00:30:13,144
(with you.)

528
00:30:14,264 --> 00:30:15,184
Come out.

529
00:30:15,184 --> 00:30:16,104
(Back then,)

530
00:30:16,944 --> 00:30:18,224
(I always put on a long face)

531
00:30:18,584 --> 00:30:19,464
(and I was short.)

532
00:30:21,184 --> 00:30:22,544
(Whenever someone picked on me,)

533
00:30:23,184 --> 00:30:25,064
(you would always protect me.)

534
00:30:28,264 --> 00:30:29,024
(As time went on,)

535
00:30:29,584 --> 00:30:30,744
(we played games.)

536
00:30:30,744 --> 00:30:31,904
Go to the left.

537
00:30:32,824 --> 00:30:33,264
Pass the ball.

538
00:30:33,264 --> 00:30:34,344
Pass me the ball.

539
00:30:34,344 --> 00:30:35,064
Faster.

540
00:30:35,504 --> 00:30:36,384
(We read comics,)

541
00:30:39,784 --> 00:30:40,944
(played truant)

542
00:30:42,304 --> 00:30:42,984
(and got punished together.)

543
00:30:44,224 --> 00:30:45,224
(Someone with a dull character like me)

544
00:30:45,904 --> 00:30:47,704
(thinks that my life is amusing)

545
00:30:48,744 --> 00:30:50,184
(because of those silly things
we have done together.)

546
00:30:51,864 --> 00:30:52,824
(I can't imagine)

547
00:30:53,704 --> 00:30:55,264
(how my life would be)

548
00:30:55,864 --> 00:30:57,144
(without you, Gao Yunlang.)

549
00:30:59,944 --> 00:31:01,104
(There is something)

550
00:31:02,184 --> 00:31:03,704
(I didn't tell you.)

551
00:31:06,064 --> 00:31:07,784
(You are my most valuable friend
for good.)

552
00:31:09,024 --> 00:31:10,144
(If possible,)

553
00:31:11,504 --> 00:31:12,824
(I will wait for you in Jingzhou.)

554
00:31:12,940 --> 00:31:15,020
(Yuezhou Station)

555
00:31:23,184 --> 00:31:23,904
Chen Mo.

556
00:31:25,784 --> 00:31:27,024
We got here on time.

557
00:31:27,344 --> 00:31:27,944
Take it.

558
00:31:28,984 --> 00:31:30,344
I can buy these in Jingzhou too.

559
00:31:30,664 --> 00:31:31,824
No need to bring these for me.

560
00:31:32,224 --> 00:31:33,424
This is a lot.

561
00:31:33,424 --> 00:31:34,904
I don't think Jingzhou sells
authentic food here.

562
00:31:35,224 --> 00:31:36,624
I brought you some dried fruits, jerky,

563
00:31:36,624 --> 00:31:37,504
fried food and flatbread.

564
00:31:37,504 --> 00:31:38,544
We will send you more
after you finish these.

565
00:31:39,384 --> 00:31:41,344
I can feel your genuine love.

566
00:31:43,664 --> 00:31:45,224
I can't copy your homework then.

567
00:31:45,784 --> 00:31:46,544
Also, no one will fight

568
00:31:46,544 --> 00:31:47,944
for the top ten places with you.

569
00:31:48,224 --> 00:31:48,864
Buddy.

570
00:31:49,504 --> 00:31:50,624
I have never been in the top ten.

571
00:31:51,024 --> 00:31:52,144
Who cares about that?

572
00:31:54,584 --> 00:31:55,264
Well.

573
00:31:59,304 --> 00:32:00,664
Can you not leave us?

574
00:32:00,664 --> 00:32:01,904
We can't bear to see you leave.

575
00:32:03,584 --> 00:32:04,024
Well.

576
00:32:04,024 --> 00:32:05,344
This is not our farewell.

577
00:32:06,064 --> 00:32:07,504
After the college entrance exam,
the East Gate Squad

578
00:32:07,504 --> 00:32:08,624
will reunite in Jingzhou.

579
00:32:09,144 --> 00:32:09,664
That's right.

580
00:32:09,664 --> 00:32:11,064
Ji Junxing and I agreed

581
00:32:11,064 --> 00:32:12,464
to go to Jinghua University together.

582
00:32:12,824 --> 00:32:14,504
It sounds like a good idea.

583
00:32:15,264 --> 00:32:15,984
Are you all

584
00:32:15,984 --> 00:32:17,224
going to Jinghua University?

585
00:32:17,224 --> 00:32:18,464
No, you can't leave me alone.

586
00:32:18,464 --> 00:32:19,224
I'm going too.

587
00:32:20,384 --> 00:32:21,304
It turns out you all...

588
00:32:21,304 --> 00:32:22,184
Are you going?

589
00:32:22,584 --> 00:32:23,664
It's fine if you are not.

590
00:32:24,024 --> 00:32:26,064
Anyway, I have Bin in Jingzhou

591
00:32:26,064 --> 00:32:26,584
and also...

592
00:32:26,584 --> 00:32:27,264
I will.

593
00:32:27,264 --> 00:32:27,944
I will go there too.

594
00:32:27,944 --> 00:32:28,904
I'm a pig if I don't.

595
00:32:29,944 --> 00:32:30,544
Well, then.

596
00:32:30,864 --> 00:32:31,944
East Gate Squad promises

597
00:32:31,944 --> 00:32:33,584
to go to Jinghua University together.

598
00:32:33,584 --> 00:32:34,424
We, the East Gate Squad

599
00:32:34,744 --> 00:32:36,024
will reunite in Jingzhou.

600
00:32:36,424 --> 00:32:40,264
It's a date.

601
00:32:40,824 --> 00:32:41,424
Take care.

602
00:32:41,704 --> 00:32:42,944
We will miss you.

603
00:32:48,384 --> 00:32:49,184
Erm...

604
00:32:49,464 --> 00:32:51,104
Gao Yunlang didn't come with you?

605
00:32:59,544 --> 00:33:00,184
It's fine.

606
00:33:00,424 --> 00:33:01,424
It's almost time.

607
00:33:01,664 --> 00:33:02,464
I should go now.

608
00:33:03,184 --> 00:33:04,024
Let us see you off.

609
00:33:04,024 --> 00:33:04,344
We will see you off.

610
00:33:04,344 --> 00:33:04,744
Let's go.

611
00:33:04,744 --> 00:33:05,664
We will go inside with you.

612
00:33:06,304 --> 00:33:07,144
Let me carry your things.

613
00:33:11,224 --> 00:33:11,984
Chen Mo!

614
00:33:37,744 --> 00:33:38,424
Chen Mo.

615
00:33:42,024 --> 00:33:43,264
I forgive you.

616
00:33:48,064 --> 00:33:49,144
Wait for me in Jingzhou.

617
00:33:51,224 --> 00:33:51,664
Sure.

618
00:33:53,184 --> 00:33:54,464
Let's meet in Jingzhou.

619
00:34:14,664 --> 00:34:15,464
Mummy.

620
00:34:15,464 --> 00:34:18,104
I want the Plants vs. Zombies toys.

621
00:34:18,424 --> 00:34:19,864
But we have a lot of
Plants vs. Zombies toys

622
00:34:19,864 --> 00:34:21,384
at home.

623
00:34:21,704 --> 00:34:22,864
I'm sorry.

624
00:34:22,864 --> 00:34:23,784
It's fine.

625
00:34:40,584 --> 00:34:41,184
Look at him.

626
00:34:41,704 --> 00:34:43,224
Gao Yunlang looks lonely

627
00:34:43,224 --> 00:34:44,904
without Chen Mo.

628
00:34:49,544 --> 00:34:50,624
Will you be as upset as him

629
00:34:50,624 --> 00:34:51,624
if I leave out of a sudden

630
00:34:51,904 --> 00:34:53,144
one day?

631
00:34:54,624 --> 00:34:55,464
How?

632
00:34:55,464 --> 00:34:56,664
Do you mean to leave the world?

633
00:34:57,464 --> 00:34:58,424
Well, I better not leave then.

634
00:35:03,144 --> 00:35:04,464
Look at Gao Yunlang.

635
00:35:04,824 --> 00:35:06,344
He looks like he loses his soul.

636
00:35:11,344 --> 00:35:12,424
I thought

637
00:35:12,944 --> 00:35:14,384
parting is still far from us.

638
00:35:14,984 --> 00:35:16,744
It will only happen
after the college entrance exam.

639
00:35:17,904 --> 00:35:19,064
Sadly,

640
00:35:19,864 --> 00:35:21,064
it happened right before us.

641
00:35:22,384 --> 00:35:25,024
Do you think

642
00:35:25,464 --> 00:35:26,704
we will be together forever?

643
00:35:27,464 --> 00:35:28,504
Yes, we will.

644
00:35:29,024 --> 00:35:30,224
Didn't we promise each other

645
00:35:30,624 --> 00:35:31,744
to go to Jinghua University

646
00:35:32,624 --> 00:35:33,704
and be together forever?

647
00:35:35,704 --> 00:35:36,744
Together forever.

648
00:35:45,984 --> 00:35:48,064
(You received the offer from NIT.)

649
00:35:48,064 --> 00:35:49,544
(Your dad is happy about that.)

650
00:35:54,704 --> 00:35:55,464
What is wrong?

651
00:35:55,904 --> 00:35:56,784
