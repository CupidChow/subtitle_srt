17
00:01:39,990 --> 00:01:42,740
(Photographic Exhibition)

18
00:01:42,770 --> 00:01:43,730
Who was it that said

19
00:01:43,730 --> 00:01:45,050
we shouldn't meet for a week?

20
00:01:45,410 --> 00:01:46,610
I'm not here to see you.

21
00:01:47,090 --> 00:01:48,610
I came to check out
the exhibition with Xing.

22
00:01:52,810 --> 00:01:54,450
I invited them to the exhibition

23
00:01:54,450 --> 00:01:55,890
to ease the mood.

24
00:01:56,890 --> 00:01:58,130
But I think I messed up again.

25
00:02:04,410 --> 00:02:05,090
Xie Ang.

26
00:02:07,450 --> 00:02:08,850
How much fund do we have left?

27
00:02:24,530 --> 00:02:25,330
Xing,

28
00:02:26,130 --> 00:02:26,770
did you gather us

29
00:02:26,770 --> 00:02:28,010
to tell us something?

30
00:02:31,490 --> 00:02:32,610
Is the popcorn good?

31
00:02:33,010 --> 00:02:34,210
We used the last
of our money to buy it.

32
00:02:34,210 --> 00:02:35,490
It has to be good.

33
00:02:36,490 --> 00:02:37,250
That's good.

34
00:02:38,210 --> 00:02:39,490
Consider this a wrap

35
00:02:39,490 --> 00:02:40,570
for

36
00:02:41,010 --> 00:02:42,250
the East Gate Start-up Squad.

37
00:02:46,570 --> 00:02:47,290
What do you mean?

38
00:02:49,090 --> 00:02:50,050
It means

39
00:02:50,730 --> 00:02:53,490
the East Gate Start-up Squad
is officially disbanded.

40
00:02:55,490 --> 00:02:56,690
Are you serious?

41
00:03:00,210 --> 00:03:01,890
When I created

42
00:03:01,890 --> 00:03:03,090
this team,

43
00:03:03,690 --> 00:03:05,610
I wanted us to do something big

44
00:03:05,930 --> 00:03:07,290
like we did in high school.

45
00:03:08,810 --> 00:03:11,050
But instead,
this start-up ended up being

46
00:03:11,930 --> 00:03:13,610
a burden for everyone.

47
00:03:15,650 --> 00:03:17,330
The smart medical band is my dream.

48
00:03:18,810 --> 00:03:19,930
Not yours.

49
00:03:24,610 --> 00:03:25,330
So

50
00:03:25,770 --> 00:03:27,610
I don't have the right
to take away your time

51
00:03:27,610 --> 00:03:28,370
and happiness.

52
00:03:34,730 --> 00:03:35,490
I've decided.

53
00:03:36,610 --> 00:03:37,650
This is the end

54
00:03:39,930 --> 00:03:40,610
of the start-up squad.

55
00:03:46,690 --> 00:03:48,530
But that's only the start-up squad.

56
00:03:49,050 --> 00:03:50,530
The East Gate Squad is staying.

57
00:04:09,530 --> 00:04:10,490
Have you made up your mind?

58
00:04:11,090 --> 00:04:12,330
Are you sure you want
to disband the start-up squad?

59
00:04:14,250 --> 00:04:15,370
I've already told them.

60
00:04:16,690 --> 00:04:19,010
Our business venture

61
00:04:19,370 --> 00:04:20,890
is just like a marathon.

62
00:04:22,010 --> 00:04:23,930
Not everyone
will get to the finish line.

63
00:04:24,570 --> 00:04:26,250
Some will leave halfway.

64
00:04:27,450 --> 00:04:30,730
But it's enough as long as

65
00:04:30,730 --> 00:04:31,570
we try our best.

66
00:04:33,610 --> 00:04:34,890
Not all of that is true.

67
00:04:35,530 --> 00:04:36,450
Which part you meant?

68
00:04:37,370 --> 00:04:39,130
AI healthcare is my dream too.

69
00:04:39,410 --> 00:04:40,530
I'm not just helping you.

70
00:04:40,530 --> 00:04:41,890
I'm fulfilling my dream too.

71
00:04:43,610 --> 00:04:45,570
So it doesn't matter if it's six

72
00:04:45,570 --> 00:04:46,450
or two.

73
00:04:46,890 --> 00:04:48,290
I'm in this with you

74
00:04:48,290 --> 00:04:50,090
until the end.

75
00:04:50,530 --> 00:04:52,170
Two don't make a team.

76
00:04:52,490 --> 00:04:53,930
That's a partnership.

77
00:04:54,970 --> 00:04:55,730
Is that so?

78
00:04:55,730 --> 00:04:57,290
I'll let you solo this, then.

79
00:04:57,650 --> 00:04:58,570
No!

80
00:05:00,010 --> 00:05:01,490
I want to fight with you.

81
00:05:04,930 --> 00:05:06,610
You better appreciate me, then.

82
00:05:09,570 --> 00:05:10,130
Let's go.

83
00:05:21,340 --> 00:05:26,340
(Jingzhou University Student
Start-up Competition Semi-Finals)

84
00:05:36,170 --> 00:05:36,810
Number 33.

85
00:05:36,810 --> 00:05:38,250
Is Ji Junxing's team here?

86
00:05:38,850 --> 00:05:40,130
Present.

87
00:05:41,370 --> 00:05:42,250
Only two?

88
00:05:42,650 --> 00:05:43,490
Where are your teammates?

89
00:05:43,850 --> 00:05:44,610
Sir,

90
00:05:44,610 --> 00:05:46,210
there are only two of us in our team.

91
00:05:46,930 --> 00:05:47,890
And us!

92
00:05:48,330 --> 00:05:49,130
Lin Xi,

93
00:05:49,130 --> 00:05:49,890
we're here!

94
00:05:52,890 --> 00:05:53,530
Okay.

95
00:05:53,530 --> 00:05:54,490
In three minutes.

96
00:05:54,490 --> 00:05:55,330
Get ready.

97
00:05:55,690 --> 00:05:56,330
All right.

98
00:05:57,410 --> 00:05:58,170
You guys...

99
00:05:58,170 --> 00:05:58,930
Xing,

100
00:05:59,250 --> 00:06:00,330
this may be your dream,

101
00:06:00,650 --> 00:06:02,170
but you've got the East Gate Squad

102
00:06:02,170 --> 00:06:03,130
to help you make it come true.

103
00:06:03,130 --> 00:06:04,050
- Right.
- That's right.

104
00:06:15,370 --> 00:06:17,010
In short, our smart band

105
00:06:17,010 --> 00:06:18,090
has considerable sensitivity

106
00:06:18,090 --> 00:06:19,570
and accuracy

107
00:06:19,570 --> 00:06:21,130
in monitoring heart rate

108
00:06:21,130 --> 00:06:22,050
and blood oxygen level.

109
00:06:22,410 --> 00:06:24,450
In addition,
through our tireless efforts,

110
00:06:24,770 --> 00:06:27,010
we've made
great adjustments and improvements

111
00:06:27,010 --> 00:06:28,570
in market research, user analysis,

112
00:06:28,570 --> 00:06:29,930
and technical upgrades

113
00:06:29,930 --> 00:06:31,090
of the smart band.

114
00:06:31,410 --> 00:06:33,090
Our next plan is to upgrade
the face of the smart band

115
00:06:33,090 --> 00:06:35,370
to wireless electrodes,

116
00:06:35,370 --> 00:06:37,010
and to combine with the ECG analysis APP

117
00:06:37,010 --> 00:06:37,850
on the phone.

118
00:06:37,850 --> 00:06:39,610
We will develop
a professional medical-grade device

119
00:06:39,610 --> 00:06:41,010
to monitor heart condition.

120
00:06:41,970 --> 00:06:43,490
These are the results

121
00:06:43,490 --> 00:06:44,690
of our team's midterm presentation.

122
00:06:45,290 --> 00:06:45,650
That's all.

123
00:06:45,650 --> 00:06:46,770
Thank you, judges.

124
00:06:53,090 --> 00:06:55,250
Your project has been progressing well.

125
00:06:55,610 --> 00:06:56,290
However,

126
00:06:56,290 --> 00:06:57,850
I would like to know

127
00:06:57,850 --> 00:07:00,530
if you've encountered any challenges

128
00:07:00,890 --> 00:07:02,890
within your team during this period.

129
00:07:06,170 --> 00:07:08,450
Challenges are to be expected.

130
00:07:10,210 --> 00:07:12,730
For example,
in the process of starting up,

131
00:07:13,210 --> 00:07:14,090
we encountered

132
00:07:14,410 --> 00:07:17,090
some organizational problems

133
00:07:17,090 --> 00:07:18,210
due to

134
00:07:18,210 --> 00:07:21,690
irregularities in the operation.

135
00:07:23,130 --> 00:07:25,290
Be more direct.

136
00:07:26,530 --> 00:07:27,810
Actually, we almost disbanded.

137
00:07:28,210 --> 00:07:29,370
We just got back together.

138
00:07:43,090 --> 00:07:44,370
How could this be?

139
00:07:46,050 --> 00:07:48,010
I didn't think
it would turn out this way.

140
00:07:48,730 --> 00:07:51,130
I have doubts

141
00:07:51,130 --> 00:07:52,690
about the judges' judging criteria.

142
00:07:53,130 --> 00:07:54,890
We analyzed ourselves

143
00:07:55,410 --> 00:07:56,770
and exposed all our weaknesses.

144
00:07:57,090 --> 00:07:57,810
But

145
00:07:58,970 --> 00:07:59,970
we still passed.

146
00:08:00,890 --> 00:08:01,730
We passed.

147
00:08:04,690 --> 00:08:05,610
You guys!

148
00:08:05,850 --> 00:08:06,650
You guys!

149
00:08:06,650 --> 00:08:07,370
What are you doing?

150
00:08:07,370 --> 00:08:08,330
Pipe down!

151
00:08:11,170 --> 00:08:11,850
You guys

152
00:08:11,850 --> 00:08:13,050
came today.

153
00:08:13,050 --> 00:08:14,490
But are you going
to leave again after this?

154
00:08:14,850 --> 00:08:15,650
If this happens again,

155
00:08:15,650 --> 00:08:17,370
Ji Junxing and I
won't have anyone to cry to.

156
00:08:18,290 --> 00:08:20,970
We were wrong.

157
00:08:21,570 --> 00:08:23,410
But we'll never quit halfway.

158
00:08:23,970 --> 00:08:25,010
We'll be here

159
00:08:25,010 --> 00:08:26,570
until you guys get
the venture capital, at least.

160
00:08:27,810 --> 00:08:30,570
Are you guys that confident in me?

161
00:08:30,570 --> 00:08:31,570
Of course.

162
00:08:31,930 --> 00:08:32,730
After all,

163
00:08:32,730 --> 00:08:33,770
you're only one step away

164
00:08:33,770 --> 00:08:35,410
from getting the venture capital.

165
00:08:36,690 --> 00:08:37,810
We already have the keys to the office

166
00:08:37,810 --> 00:08:38,610
in the pioneer park.

167
00:08:39,010 --> 00:08:40,970
I heard it's in the luxury office area

168
00:08:40,970 --> 00:08:42,450
in the central business district.

169
00:08:43,970 --> 00:08:44,930
I can already imagine myself

170
00:08:44,930 --> 00:08:46,290
sitting in the centre of the city,

171
00:08:46,290 --> 00:08:48,330
overlooking the urban landscape.

172
00:08:48,610 --> 00:08:49,290
Why don't we go

173
00:08:49,290 --> 00:08:50,530
and check it out now?

174
00:08:51,170 --> 00:08:52,210
- Let's go.
- Let's go.

175
00:08:53,050 --> 00:08:53,730
Come on.

176
00:09:13,570 --> 00:09:14,810
So this is the legendary

177
00:09:14,810 --> 00:09:16,810
luxury office area
in the central business district?

178
00:09:18,090 --> 00:09:20,770
Is this what they call
the "tower in the air"?

179
00:09:22,130 --> 00:09:23,570
Did we get the wrong place?

180
00:09:24,850 --> 00:09:25,850
No.

181
00:09:25,850 --> 00:09:26,650
201.

182
00:09:27,370 --> 00:09:28,250
This is the office.

183
00:09:28,690 --> 00:09:30,570
Actually, it's not that bad.

184
00:09:31,810 --> 00:09:33,130
There's even a broom here.

185
00:09:35,410 --> 00:09:36,770
- Enough.
- Stop sweeping.

186
00:09:37,010 --> 00:09:37,530
Stop!

187
00:09:37,530 --> 00:09:38,810
Put the broom down.
You're getting dust everywhere.

188
00:09:40,210 --> 00:09:41,410
We're definitely lacking

189
00:09:41,410 --> 00:09:42,930
a significant amount of resources.

190
00:09:44,090 --> 00:09:44,810
Head of Finance,

191
00:09:45,210 --> 00:09:46,130
have you got any ideas?

192
00:09:47,730 --> 00:09:49,170
Based on my years of experience,

193
00:09:50,090 --> 00:09:51,130
when you're severely short

194
00:09:51,130 --> 00:09:51,930
of something,

195
00:09:52,330 --> 00:09:54,090
don't rush to buy them.

196
00:09:54,770 --> 00:09:57,050
Turn your sights
on the people around you.

197
00:09:57,370 --> 00:09:59,090
They might be able
to solve your problem.

198
00:10:12,330 --> 00:10:13,010
Sir,

199
00:10:13,330 --> 00:10:14,490
can I take this hard drive?

200
00:10:18,170 --> 00:10:18,970
Take them.

201
00:10:19,770 --> 00:10:20,690
Thank you, sir.

202
00:10:23,450 --> 00:10:24,090
Sir,

203
00:10:25,010 --> 00:10:26,290
can these mouses still be used?

204
00:10:27,130 --> 00:10:27,890
You can have them.

205
00:10:38,770 --> 00:10:39,290
Sir,

206
00:10:39,290 --> 00:10:41,330
these monitors have been
on these shelves for a while, right?

207
00:10:41,850 --> 00:10:44,330
They should still work.

208
00:10:46,570 --> 00:10:47,050
Here.

209
00:10:49,130 --> 00:10:49,930
Ji Junxing,

210
00:10:50,290 --> 00:10:51,930
how did an elite student
of the Department of Computer Science

211
00:10:51,930 --> 00:10:53,050
turn into this?

212
00:10:55,330 --> 00:10:56,210
Entrepreneurship.

213
00:10:59,210 --> 00:10:59,970
I understand.

214
00:10:59,970 --> 00:11:00,890
I've been through that too.

215
00:11:01,330 --> 00:11:02,890
Take whatever you need.

216
00:11:03,730 --> 00:11:06,170
These computers are old and broken.

217
00:11:06,650 --> 00:11:07,810
But I'm sure

218
00:11:08,170 --> 00:11:10,090
you can fix them up with your skills.

219
00:11:11,010 --> 00:11:11,930
Take whatever you need.

220
00:11:12,530 --> 00:11:13,450
Thank you for your support, sir.

221
00:11:23,050 --> 00:11:23,850
How did it go?

222
00:11:23,850 --> 00:11:24,650
Did you get the stuff?

223
00:11:24,970 --> 00:11:26,890
I've got almost all the hardware
equipment we need for the office.

224
00:11:27,370 --> 00:11:29,010
I've got good news too.

225
00:11:29,370 --> 00:11:29,970
I'll meet up with you

226
00:11:29,970 --> 00:11:31,330
with the loot I got from my department

227
00:11:31,330 --> 00:11:32,090
later.

228
00:11:32,370 --> 00:11:33,050
Okay.

229
00:11:55,930 --> 00:11:56,610
What do you think?

230
00:11:56,610 --> 00:11:57,690
Not bad, right?

231
00:11:58,530 --> 00:11:59,850
I don't think that's necessary.

232
00:12:00,250 --> 00:12:01,570
Why not?

233
00:12:01,570 --> 00:12:02,490
We're talking about AI healthcare.

234
00:12:02,490 --> 00:12:03,330
We need your AI

235
00:12:03,330 --> 00:12:04,610
and my medical elements.

236
00:12:04,930 --> 00:12:07,290
This is a symbol of our partnership.

237
00:12:07,610 --> 00:12:09,490
Couldn't you pick something
less morbid for that?

238
00:12:09,970 --> 00:12:11,130
How is this morbid?

239
00:12:11,490 --> 00:12:13,250
Look at the smooth inclination
of the bones.

240
00:12:13,250 --> 00:12:14,450
These fine lines.

241
00:12:14,810 --> 00:12:16,090
It's a work of art.

242
00:12:16,770 --> 00:12:17,290
Act more

243
00:12:17,290 --> 00:12:18,570
like a family member
of a medical student.

244
00:12:19,010 --> 00:12:19,970
My bad.

245
00:12:20,330 --> 00:12:21,370
That's more like it.

246
00:12:22,050 --> 00:12:23,130
What did you get?

247
00:12:23,770 --> 00:12:26,050
Keyboards. Mouses.

248
00:12:26,050 --> 00:12:27,450
I even got us monitors.

249
00:12:27,810 --> 00:12:28,730
Enough for all of us?

250
00:12:29,250 --> 00:12:30,130
My teacher said
I could come back for more

251
00:12:30,130 --> 00:12:30,930
whenever I need it.

252
00:12:30,930 --> 00:12:31,690
That's so nice of him!

253
00:12:48,650 --> 00:12:49,330
Xie Ang!

254
00:12:49,610 --> 00:12:50,410
Xie Ang.

255
00:12:50,410 --> 00:12:50,850
Don't you think

256
00:12:50,850 --> 00:12:52,410
we were so cool earlier?

257
00:12:52,410 --> 00:12:53,850
Why did you have to break the momentum?

258
00:12:53,850 --> 00:12:54,330
That's right.

259
00:12:54,330 --> 00:12:55,490
Why did you break the bicycle chain?

260
00:12:55,490 --> 00:12:56,690
I knew you were unreliable.

261
00:12:56,690 --> 00:12:58,250
How are we supposed
to run a business like this?

262
00:12:58,250 --> 00:12:58,890
Stop bickering!

263
00:12:58,890 --> 00:13:00,010
Help me push this.

264
00:13:00,210 --> 00:13:01,410
I don't know
who got us this lousy bicycle.

265
00:13:01,410 --> 00:13:02,330
The quality is poor.

266
00:13:02,330 --> 00:13:02,850
Push.

267
00:13:02,850 --> 00:13:04,010
Blaming me
for the lousy bicycle that broke down...

268
00:13:04,010 --> 00:13:05,130
I knew this would happen.

269
00:13:05,250 --> 00:13:06,090
Slowly.

270
00:13:09,730 --> 00:13:10,290
Here.

271
00:13:13,850 --> 00:13:14,730
Lin Xi,

272
00:13:15,010 --> 00:13:16,410
where do you think
we should put the calendar

273
00:13:16,410 --> 00:13:17,530
so both of us can see it?

274
00:13:17,530 --> 00:13:18,490
In the centre.

275
00:13:18,810 --> 00:13:19,370
Okay.

276
00:13:26,690 --> 00:13:28,050
What's going on with you and Xie Ang?

277
00:13:28,050 --> 00:13:28,890
Did you guys make up?

278
00:13:29,290 --> 00:13:29,770
No.

279
00:13:30,170 --> 00:13:31,770
I don't know what got into him.

280
00:13:31,770 --> 00:13:32,730
He has been acting strange
these few days.

281
00:13:33,170 --> 00:13:35,570
He kept asking me if I like him

282
00:13:35,570 --> 00:13:37,170
and if I ever love him at all.

283
00:13:38,130 --> 00:13:38,970
Maybe he lost confidence

284
00:13:38,970 --> 00:13:40,050
in himself

285
00:13:40,050 --> 00:13:41,410
because of all the fights
you guys have been getting into.

286
00:13:42,250 --> 00:13:44,730
Well, to boost his spirits,

287
00:13:45,050 --> 00:13:46,250
I've prepared

288
00:13:46,250 --> 00:13:48,730
a personalized Christmas surprise
for him.

289
00:13:49,770 --> 00:13:50,290
You're actually

290
00:13:50,290 --> 00:13:51,610
taking the initiative
to do something romantic.

291
00:13:57,040 --> 00:14:00,540
(Incubator)

292
00:14:00,570 --> 00:14:01,570
I'm done with my end.

293
00:14:01,810 --> 00:14:02,490
What about you guys?

294
00:14:03,090 --> 00:14:04,210
- We're done too.
- We're done too.

295
00:14:04,210 --> 00:14:05,090
Perfect.

296
00:14:05,090 --> 00:14:06,130
Good work, everyone.

297
00:14:06,370 --> 00:14:08,290
Now, the Christmas opening ceremony

298
00:14:08,290 --> 00:14:09,450
will officially begin!

299
00:14:17,540 --> 00:14:19,210
(Incubator)

300
00:14:19,210 --> 00:14:21,010
To celebrate our new office

301
00:14:21,010 --> 00:14:21,810
and taking another big step

302
00:14:21,810 --> 00:14:22,730
on the road to success!

303
00:14:22,730 --> 00:14:23,330
Cheers!

304
00:14:23,330 --> 00:14:25,930
- Cheers!
- Cheers!

305
00:14:28,770 --> 00:14:29,330
Oh, I almost forgot.

306
00:14:29,330 --> 00:14:30,010
I'll be right back.

307
00:14:30,410 --> 00:14:31,650
I found something good

308
00:14:31,650 --> 00:14:33,090
when I was searching
for stationery today.

309
00:14:33,090 --> 00:14:34,610
It's the perfect party game.

310
00:14:34,810 --> 00:14:35,730
What's this?

311
00:14:38,890 --> 00:14:40,810
We've got a big mystery box to open.

312
00:14:41,170 --> 00:14:42,250
Used tape?

313
00:14:42,690 --> 00:14:43,370
No.

314
00:14:43,370 --> 00:14:44,850
This is no ordinary tape.

315
00:14:44,850 --> 00:14:46,490
These are tapes

316
00:14:46,490 --> 00:14:47,370
from our meetings in high school.

317
00:14:49,330 --> 00:14:51,050
The chat logs
of our meetings in high school?

318
00:14:51,050 --> 00:14:51,650
Bingo.

319
00:14:52,330 --> 00:14:54,210
It seems we're taking a trip
down memory lane today.

320
00:14:55,290 --> 00:14:56,010
Everyone,

321
00:14:56,010 --> 00:14:57,290
are you ready to go down

322
00:14:57,290 --> 00:14:58,530
memory lane with me?

323
00:14:58,530 --> 00:14:59,330
- Bring it on.
- Bring it on.

324
00:14:59,330 --> 00:15:00,090
Open them.

325
00:15:00,660 --> 00:15:01,690
(Mianmian,
what are you doing this weekend?)

326
00:15:01,930 --> 00:15:02,450
Xie Ang,

327
00:15:02,450 --> 00:15:03,570
you're the first.

328
00:15:06,450 --> 00:15:07,210
"Mianmian,

329
00:15:07,210 --> 00:15:08,450
they're showing Stephen Chow's movie.

330
00:15:08,450 --> 00:15:10,170
Want to watch it with me?"

331
00:15:12,210 --> 00:15:13,210
"I want to watch it,

332
00:15:13,210 --> 00:15:14,450
but not with you."

333
00:15:15,970 --> 00:15:17,610
You guys haven't changed

334
00:15:17,610 --> 00:15:18,810
the way you interact at all.

335
00:15:19,370 --> 00:15:20,290
Xie Ang,

336
00:15:20,290 --> 00:15:21,810
you can publish a diary
about the trials and heartaches

337
00:15:21,810 --> 00:15:25,250
of pursuing love with your experience.

338
00:15:26,170 --> 00:15:27,490
Enough about me.

339
00:15:27,490 --> 00:15:28,330
Let's read someone else's.

340
00:15:28,330 --> 00:15:29,170
Next.

341
00:15:29,810 --> 00:15:30,610
The second tape.

342
00:15:38,170 --> 00:15:39,490
Don't tell me it's mine.

343
00:15:41,170 --> 00:15:42,930
"What do you think about Ji Junxing?"

344
00:15:43,210 --> 00:15:45,970
"Arrogant, stoic and disliked."

345
00:15:46,490 --> 00:15:47,130
"But

346
00:15:47,130 --> 00:15:48,970
a lot of girls in our school

347
00:15:48,970 --> 00:15:49,930
like him."

348
00:15:50,290 --> 00:15:52,690
"Something must be wrong in the head

349
00:15:52,690 --> 00:15:54,090
for anyone who likes him."

350
00:15:55,730 --> 00:15:56,850
I didn't expect myself

351
00:15:56,850 --> 00:15:58,250
to be wrong in the head.

352
00:15:58,250 --> 00:15:59,010
I admit.

353
00:16:00,010 --> 00:16:00,610
Hang on.

354
00:16:00,610 --> 00:16:01,890
There's more.

355
00:16:01,890 --> 00:16:03,970
"I think ZH from the next class

356
00:16:03,970 --> 00:16:05,170
is more handsome than him.

357
00:16:05,770 --> 00:16:06,810
He has nice eyes

358
00:16:06,810 --> 00:16:08,530
and a gentle voice."

359
00:16:10,250 --> 00:16:11,450
"ZH"?

360
00:16:11,450 --> 00:16:12,250
To think

361
00:16:12,250 --> 00:16:13,730
there would be a day
when you lose to someone.

362
00:16:14,850 --> 00:16:16,050
Everyone makes mistakes

363
00:16:16,050 --> 00:16:17,090
and poor judgements when they're young.

364
00:16:19,970 --> 00:16:20,810
Do you guys remember?

365
00:16:21,090 --> 00:16:22,450
Back then, the East Gate Squad

366
00:16:22,450 --> 00:16:23,130
was formed

367
00:16:23,130 --> 00:16:24,490
because of a basketball game.

368
00:16:24,770 --> 00:16:25,810
We even lost that game.

369
00:16:26,130 --> 00:16:27,130
Now that I think about it,

370
00:16:27,130 --> 00:16:28,370
it was a bit hasty of us.

371
00:16:28,970 --> 00:16:29,970
Not at all!

372
00:16:29,970 --> 00:16:31,210
This is fate!

373
00:16:31,210 --> 00:16:32,650
- Yes.
- Fate.

374
00:16:32,650 --> 00:16:33,850
Fate.

375
00:16:33,850 --> 00:16:35,330
- Here! To Fate!
- Here! To Fate!

376
00:16:35,330 --> 00:16:36,050
Cheers!

377
00:16:38,730 --> 00:16:39,530
Come on. Don't just drink.

378
00:16:39,530 --> 00:16:39,930
Eat.

379
00:16:39,930 --> 00:16:40,970
Let's see who else's tape is in here.

380
00:16:44,940 --> 00:16:48,490
(Incubator)

381
00:16:48,530 --> 00:16:49,490
It's getting late.

382
00:16:49,490 --> 00:16:50,770
I have an early class tomorrow.

383
00:16:51,650 --> 00:16:53,090
I'll go back with Lin Xi.

384
00:16:53,930 --> 00:16:54,770
I'm going to Chen Mo's place

385
00:16:54,770 --> 00:16:56,250
to continue writing my paper.

386
00:16:57,250 --> 00:16:58,250
Let's all leave together, then.

387
00:16:58,250 --> 00:16:58,970
Xie Ang!

388
00:16:59,890 --> 00:17:00,770
Stay back for a bit.

389
00:17:03,130 --> 00:17:04,050
We'll take our leave first, then.

390
00:17:04,330 --> 00:17:05,250
You guys take your time.

391
00:17:05,250 --> 00:17:05,690
Okay.

392
00:17:05,690 --> 00:17:06,210
Bye.

393
00:17:06,210 --> 00:17:06,450
We're off.

394
00:17:06,450 --> 00:17:07,770
- Bye.
- Bye!

395
00:17:19,330 --> 00:17:20,690
It's so beautiful!

396
00:17:21,930 --> 00:17:22,890
It is pretty.

397
00:17:32,130 --> 00:17:32,850
Better?

398
00:17:34,410 --> 00:17:35,170
Yes.

399
00:17:35,530 --> 00:17:36,810
Having a boyfriend sure is nice.

400
00:17:40,570 --> 00:17:42,490
Who is better?

401
00:17:42,850 --> 00:17:43,850
"ZH" or me?

402
00:17:45,010 --> 00:17:46,610
You, of course!

403
00:17:48,490 --> 00:17:49,810
Are you still hung up on that?

404
00:17:50,050 --> 00:17:51,130
Of course.

405
00:17:51,850 --> 00:17:53,330
Tall and handsome.

406
00:17:53,610 --> 00:17:54,890
Soft-spoken.

407
00:17:55,410 --> 00:17:57,050
Nice eyes.

408
00:17:57,850 --> 00:17:59,330
"ZH" sounds special.

409
00:17:59,770 --> 00:18:00,650
Who is he?

410
00:18:01,450 --> 00:18:02,650
I don't remember.

411
00:18:03,810 --> 00:18:04,810
Do you think I would buy that?

412
00:18:07,490 --> 00:18:09,210
You can't be mad if I tell you.

413
00:18:11,250 --> 00:18:13,290
It's Zhou Han from Class Two.

414
00:18:13,290 --> 00:18:14,530
A lot of girls in our year

415
00:18:14,530 --> 00:18:15,410
were talking about him.

416
00:18:15,410 --> 00:18:17,090
I participated a little

417
00:18:17,090 --> 00:18:18,170
in the girls' conversation

418
00:18:18,170 --> 00:18:19,490
and threw in a few compliments.

419
00:18:19,890 --> 00:18:21,130
I don't have any feelings for him.

420
00:18:21,130 --> 00:18:22,170
I swear.

421
00:18:22,490 --> 00:18:23,570
Really?

422
00:18:23,570 --> 00:18:25,210
You still used
all those adjectives to compliment him

423
00:18:25,730 --> 00:18:26,810
and remembered him
after all these years.

424
00:18:31,890 --> 00:18:32,690
Are you upset?

425
00:18:35,610 --> 00:18:36,690
Are you really upset?

426
00:18:37,130 --> 00:18:37,650
Yes.

427
00:18:38,010 --> 00:18:38,810
I'm upset.

428
00:18:42,970 --> 00:18:44,690
I guess I'll need to think
of some nice adjectives

429
00:18:44,690 --> 00:18:46,170
to compliment you too.

430
00:18:47,370 --> 00:18:48,930
You are

431
00:18:49,250 --> 00:18:50,410
the most handsome,

432
00:18:50,810 --> 00:18:52,090
the cutest,

433
00:18:52,490 --> 00:18:54,850
and the boyfriend I love the most

434
00:18:55,130 --> 00:18:56,970
and want to be with

435
00:18:56,970 --> 00:18:58,010
forever.

436
00:18:58,650 --> 00:19:00,450
The moment I fell in love with you,

437
00:19:00,730 --> 00:19:03,290
everyone else in this world
lost their colors.

438
00:19:03,970 --> 00:19:05,570
You're the only one shining

439
00:19:05,570 --> 00:19:06,770
in my world.

440
00:19:17,290 --> 00:19:18,250
A little too late

441
00:19:18,690 --> 00:19:19,530
for flattery.

442
00:19:23,930 --> 00:19:24,730
What about now?

443
00:19:25,970 --> 00:19:27,410
This is what it takes

444
00:19:29,450 --> 00:19:30,170
to appease me.

445
00:19:51,540 --> 00:19:55,390

(Your parcel is 500 meters away)

455
00:20:28,130 --> 00:20:29,370
It has been half an hour.

456
00:20:29,370 --> 00:20:30,210
What are you waiting for?

457
00:20:30,490 --> 00:20:31,250
I'm meeting with someone.

458
00:20:31,250 --> 00:20:32,290
He'll be right over soon.

459
00:20:32,930 --> 00:20:33,770
Who?

460
00:20:36,050 --> 00:20:36,730
Hello?

461
00:20:37,530 --> 00:20:38,570
Are you here?

462
00:20:38,570 --> 00:20:39,930
Okay. I'll be right down.

463
00:20:46,090 --> 00:20:47,330
Wait for me to come back.

464
00:21:06,370 --> 00:21:07,050
Thanks.

465
00:21:11,210 --> 00:21:11,890
Jiang Yimian.

466
00:21:13,210 --> 00:21:14,050
He Qingyuan?

467
00:21:14,290 --> 00:21:15,290
Why are you here?

468
00:21:16,130 --> 00:21:17,370
To wish you a merry Christmas

469
00:21:17,650 --> 00:21:19,610
and bid farewell to you.

470
00:21:20,250 --> 00:21:21,330
Farewell?

471
00:21:21,330 --> 00:21:22,250
Where are you going?

472
00:21:22,530 --> 00:21:23,610
I got an offer

473
00:21:23,610 --> 00:21:25,050
from an internet company in Shanghai.

474
00:21:25,050 --> 00:21:26,330
I'll report for duty next week.

475
00:21:26,330 --> 00:21:27,250
Really?

476
00:21:27,250 --> 00:21:28,410
That's great news!

477
00:21:28,410 --> 00:21:29,290
Congratulations!

478
00:21:32,330 --> 00:21:34,610
Do you want to come with me to Shanghai

479
00:21:34,970 --> 00:21:36,730
after you graduate?

480
00:21:40,970 --> 00:21:42,170
I mean...

481
00:21:42,570 --> 00:21:44,170
If you do,

482
00:21:44,570 --> 00:21:46,050
we can go out for meals,

483
00:21:46,050 --> 00:21:46,810
go to exhibitions,

484
00:21:46,810 --> 00:21:48,490
and take walks along the Huangpu River.

485
00:21:50,850 --> 00:21:52,130
You can call me whenever you need me.

486
00:21:52,490 --> 00:21:53,650
I'll be right there
in the first instance.

487
00:22:05,210 --> 00:22:06,210
Did the person come?

488
00:22:06,850 --> 00:22:07,450
Yes.

489
00:22:07,770 --> 00:22:09,170
And he brought a huge surprise...

490
00:22:09,170 --> 00:22:10,370
Let's break up.

491
00:22:16,690 --> 00:22:17,450
What was that?

492
00:22:22,130 --> 00:22:23,010
Xie Ang.

493
00:22:23,810 --> 00:22:25,170
Xie Ang! Get back here!

494
00:22:28,890 --> 00:22:29,610
Xie Ang,

495
00:22:29,610 --> 00:22:30,450
stop right there!

496
00:22:32,730 --> 00:22:33,410
Xie Ang!

497
00:22:34,490 --> 00:22:35,450
I'll give you one chance.

498
00:22:35,770 --> 00:22:36,570
Take it back,

499
00:22:36,570 --> 00:22:37,930
and I'll pretend I never heard it.

500
00:22:38,690 --> 00:22:39,370
Jiang Yimian,

501
00:22:40,490 --> 00:22:41,250
do you love me?

502
00:22:43,290 --> 00:22:44,570
We've been together for so many years.

503
00:22:46,050 --> 00:22:47,050
Have you ever loved me?

504
00:22:48,610 --> 00:22:49,330
Why do you keep

505
00:22:49,330 --> 00:22:50,690
asking me that lately?

506
00:22:51,890 --> 00:22:52,570
No reason.

507
00:22:54,130 --> 00:22:55,410
It has been so long

508
00:22:56,570 --> 00:22:57,970
that I can't tell

509
00:22:59,050 --> 00:23:00,970
if we're together
just because we're used to it

510
00:23:02,050 --> 00:23:03,290
or if we actually love each other.

511
00:23:08,210 --> 00:23:09,410
Or did we mistake friendship

512
00:23:09,410 --> 00:23:10,570
for romance?

513
00:23:12,290 --> 00:23:13,570
So you're saying

514
00:23:13,570 --> 00:23:14,690
that we've never loved each other

515
00:23:14,690 --> 00:23:15,890
in all these years?

516
00:23:16,370 --> 00:23:18,650
We always fight over the smallest things

517
00:23:18,650 --> 00:23:19,690
and break up.

518
00:23:20,770 --> 00:23:22,010
Then,
I would ask you to come back to me.

519
00:23:22,770 --> 00:23:24,530
After a short while,

520
00:23:24,530 --> 00:23:26,890
we go back to bickering and arguing.

521
00:23:31,490 --> 00:23:32,290
Did you know?

522
00:23:34,690 --> 00:23:36,010
It's exhausting

523
00:23:36,010 --> 00:23:37,250
always being the one

524
00:23:38,530 --> 00:23:39,650
that makes the first move.

525
00:23:41,730 --> 00:23:43,050
I'm really tired.

526
00:23:49,330 --> 00:23:50,130
Jiang Yimian,

527
00:23:53,210 --> 00:23:54,530
I don't like you anymore.

528
00:23:59,490 --> 00:24:00,330
Let's break up.

529
00:24:04,050 --> 00:24:04,930

530
00:24:04,930 --> 00:24:05,690
You fool!

531
00:24:05,690 --> 00:24:07,330
Do you know what day it is today?

532
00:24:07,930 --> 00:24:08,810
Xie Ang!

533
00:24:09,290 --> 00:24:10,450
I'll give you ten seconds!

534
00:24:10,450 --> 00:24:11,690
Come back within ten seconds,

535
00:24:11,690 --> 00:24:12,970
and I'll forgive you!

I thought

592
00:26:20,450 --> 00:26:21,850
you didn't like him that much.

doesn't mean we're quitting.

we'll always be members

I guarantee I won't quit halfway.

674

Okay.

676
00:31:26,450 --> 00:31:27,450
Since that's the case,

677
00:31:27,690 --> 00:31:28,930
I'll get straight to the main point.

678

moved into this building today too.

683

00:31:38,930 --> 00:31:40,010

686

this morning.

00:31:42,330 --> 00:31:43,450
They're making smart bands too.

688
00:31:43,730 --> 00:31:44,650
Sports smart bands.

689
00:31:46,370 --> 00:31:47,450
That means his project

690
00:31:47,450 --> 00:31:48,890
will fall
under the same category as ours.

691
00:31:49,250 --> 00:31:49,690
Yes.

692
00:31:49,690 --> 00:31:50,810
That's how competition works.

693
00:31:51,250 --> 00:31:52,130
Everyone brings the best to the table.

694
00:31:53,570 --> 00:31:54,530
But I'm confident

695
00:31:55,010 --> 00:31:56,130
that I can defeat him.

696
00:32:00,930 --> 00:32:01,610
This part.

697
00:32:02,210 --> 00:32:03,450
Put this as the first item.

698
00:32:04,050 --> 00:32:05,410
Put this one as the second point.

699
00:32:05,410 --> 00:32:07,050
Then, write out their characteristics.

700
00:32:12,050 --> 00:32:12,770
Let me see it.

701
00:32:12,770 --> 00:32:14,690
Why is the data still not accurate?

702
00:32:15,250 --> 00:32:16,730
Fill in the blood pressure
and protein data

703
00:32:16,970 --> 00:32:18,170
here,

704
00:32:18,170 --> 00:32:19,330
and change the image

705
00:32:19,650 --> 00:32:20,570
into this one.

706
00:32:22,850 --> 00:32:23,810
Here. Give these to me.

707
00:32:26,890 --> 00:32:27,970
Is this all right?

708
00:32:28,850 --> 00:32:31,930
Regarding the technology
of the chip in the smart band,

709
00:32:31,930 --> 00:32:34,370
collecting information
shouldn't be a problem.

710
00:32:34,930 --> 00:32:36,970
The key is improving

711
00:32:36,970 --> 00:32:38,650
the chip's discrimination
and screening capability.

712
00:32:38,650 --> 00:32:39,650
That's crucial.

713
00:32:39,930 --> 00:32:40,610
Got it?

714
00:32:42,010 --> 00:32:42,930
Um...

715
00:32:42,930 --> 00:32:45,570
There is repetition in the process

716
00:32:45,570 --> 00:32:47,370
of volatility.

717
00:32:47,610 --> 00:32:49,850
There is low and high volatility.

718
00:32:50,290 --> 00:32:50,850
Hello.

719
00:32:50,850 --> 00:32:51,730
- Excuse me.
- Can we ask you a few questions?

720
00:32:51,730 --> 00:32:53,450
This is our latest smart band.

721
00:32:53,450 --> 00:32:54,330
Excuse me.

722
00:32:54,490 --> 00:32:56,010
Can you spare some time
to learn more about this smart band?

723
00:32:56,010 --> 00:32:56,850
It'll only take a minute.

724
00:32:56,850 --> 00:32:58,370
It's about heart problems.

725
00:32:58,370 --> 00:32:59,770
Please take a look at this smart band.

726
00:32:59,770 --> 00:33:00,770
Can you answer

727
00:33:00,770 --> 00:33:01,410
this questionnaire for me?

728
00:33:02,570 --> 00:33:04,090
Are you interested
in answering a questionnaire?

729
00:33:04,090 --> 00:33:05,290
Are you interested?

730
00:33:05,970 --> 00:33:07,290
Thank you.

731
00:33:07,290 --> 00:33:08,090
It's meant to monitor the heart.

732
00:33:08,090 --> 00:33:09,330
Please let me tell you more
about this smart band.

733
00:33:09,330 --> 00:33:10,450
This is a device for heart problems.

734
00:33:39,050 --> 00:33:41,410
The fundamental principle
of the monitoring technology

735
00:33:42,130 --> 00:33:43,330
of our smart medical band

736
00:33:43,330 --> 00:33:45,810
is achieved by adapting various sensors.

737
00:33:46,010 --> 00:33:47,730
The basic data obtained by the sensors

738
00:33:47,730 --> 00:33:49,130
after interpreting
the changes of the user

739
00:33:49,410 --> 00:33:50,650
at different times

740
00:33:51,050 --> 00:33:52,850
combined with the general information

741
00:33:52,850 --> 00:33:54,930
of the user's body and health

742
00:33:55,210 --> 00:33:56,930
can be displayed on this.

743
00:33:59,450 --> 00:34:00,690
Finally, use...

744
00:34:12,450 --> 00:34:13,050
Let's go.

745
00:34:13,490 --> 00:34:14,770
Let's view it on my computer.

746
00:34:18,450 --> 00:34:19,410
Will it be clearer

747
00:34:19,410 --> 00:34:20,570
if we add a data chart here?

748
00:34:22,210 --> 00:34:23,410
I think we can widen

749
00:34:23,410 --> 00:34:24,530
the line spacing a little more.

750
00:34:25,730 --> 00:34:26,370
This part?

751
00:34:26,370 --> 00:34:26,970
Yes.

752
00:34:27,290 --> 00:34:28,250
We can give it a try.

753
00:34:29,690 --> 00:34:30,410
I see you are busy in here.

754
00:34:30,770 --> 00:34:31,730
Is there anything you need?

755
00:34:32,130 --> 00:34:33,170
I came to borrow the printer.

756
00:34:33,170 --> 00:34:34,530
Ours ran out of ink.

757
00:34:34,890 --> 00:34:35,450
Did you use up all your fund

758
00:34:35,450 --> 00:34:36,530
to print business cards?

759
00:34:37,770 --> 00:34:39,330
Anyone can run into unexpected troubles.

760
00:34:39,810 --> 00:34:40,450
Come on. Help us out.

761
00:34:40,450 --> 00:34:41,210
We're friends, after all.

762
00:34:41,610 --> 00:34:42,410
Go ahead.

763
00:34:42,890 --> 00:34:43,530
Thanks.

764
00:34:49,010 --> 00:34:49,690
Sure?

765
00:34:50,850 --> 00:34:51,490
Let's give it a try.

766
00:34:52,170 --> 00:34:53,850
I think the night mode is good.

767
00:35:00,850 --> 00:35:02,090
I would use this too.

768
00:35:06,570 --> 00:35:07,730
I think

769
00:35:07,930 --> 00:35:09,210
most users won't need

770
00:35:09,210 --> 00:35:09,850
this endurance score.

771
00:35:09,970 --> 00:35:10,810
We can remove this.

772
00:35:10,810 --> 00:35:11,690
Thanks!

773
00:35:14,170 --> 00:35:15,290
This is for athletes.

774
00:35:16,610 --> 00:35:17,050
Yes.

775
00:35:17,050 --> 00:35:18,210
Most users won't need this function.

776
00:35:18,370 --> 00:35:19,210
Let's go there and try it out.

777
00:35:19,210 --> 00:35:21,170
We can create a normal version
and a professional version.

778
00:35:21,370 --> 00:35:22,650
Will that be too complicated?

779
00:35:22,940 --> 00:35:31,240
(Jingzhou University Student
Start-up Competition Finals)

780
00:35:34,130 --> 00:35:35,450
Number 13. Get ready.

781
00:35:35,730 --> 00:35:36,730
You guys are next.

782
00:35:36,730 --> 00:35:37,570
Yes, sir.

783
00:35:37,570 --> 00:35:38,330
Thank you, sir.

784
00:35:42,730 --> 00:35:43,730
Oh, no! This is bad!

785
00:35:43,730 --> 00:35:44,970
What do we do? What do we do?

786
00:35:45,490 --> 00:35:46,210
What's wrong?

787
00:35:46,210 --> 00:35:47,130
Why are you so flustered?

788
00:35:47,130 --> 00:35:47,930
I just passed by the conference room.

789
00:35:47,930 --> 00:35:49,210
I overheard
Shen Pengyu's team's roadshow.

790
00:35:49,450 --> 00:35:50,250
Their plan

791
00:35:50,250 --> 00:35:51,450
is exactly like ours!

792
00:35:52,490 --> 00:35:53,410
I knew it!

793
00:35:53,410 --> 00:35:54,490
I knew they were up to no good

794
00:35:54,490 --> 00:35:55,410
when they came to our office every day!

795
00:36:07,330 --> 00:36:09,650
Good luck.

796
00:36:11,090 --> 00:36:13,010
Do your best, Ji Junxing.

797
00:36:17,530 --> 00:36:19,050
I won't disappoint you guys.

798
00:36:20,290 --> 00:36:21,050
All right.

799
00:36:22,010 --> 00:36:23,730
Let's wait and see.

800
00:36:30,370 --> 00:36:31,530
What do we do now?

801
00:36:33,090 --> 00:36:34,370
We can only adapt

802
00:36:34,770 --> 00:36:36,050
and play it by ear.

803
00:36:50,450 --> 00:36:51,250
Are you all right?

804
00:36:53,010 --> 00:36:53,730
I'm fine.

805
00:36:54,570 --> 00:36:55,210
Eat.

806
00:36:55,730 --> 00:36:57,090
How can you eat at a time like this?

807
00:36:58,530 --> 00:36:59,810
No matter what happens,

808
00:37:00,170 --> 00:37:01,250
you have to eat.

809
00:37:10,530 --> 00:37:11,410
What a coincidence.

810
00:37:15,090 --> 00:37:16,210
Why

811
00:37:16,210 --> 00:37:17,170
the gloomy faces?

812
00:37:18,010 --> 00:37:20,370
Did you guys screw up your presentation?

813
00:37:21,410 --> 00:37:22,450
I heard you guys were only inside

814
00:37:22,450 --> 00:37:23,690
for about ten minutes

815
00:37:24,570 --> 00:37:25,490
before you came out.

816
00:37:25,930 --> 00:37:27,690
That's none of your business.

817
00:37:27,970 --> 00:37:29,050
Don't get so riled up.

818
00:37:29,050 --> 00:37:30,010
We're all friends.

819
00:37:30,210 --> 00:37:30,970
We're just showing our concern.

820
00:37:31,530 --> 00:37:32,210
Pengyu,

821
00:37:32,450 --> 00:37:33,850
why did you plagiarize our work?

822
00:37:34,250 --> 00:37:35,130
Lin Xi,

823
00:37:35,130 --> 00:37:37,250
you shouldn't throw
that word around carelessly.

824
00:37:37,250 --> 00:37:39,370
Smart bands
are all more or less the same.

825
00:37:39,370 --> 00:37:40,850
It's normal to share similarities.

826
00:37:40,850 --> 00:37:41,490
That's not plagiarism?

827
00:37:41,490 --> 00:37:42,330
You guys changed your project
from a sports smart band

828
00:37:42,330 --> 00:37:43,890
to a smart medical band
so close to the finals!

829
00:37:43,890 --> 00:37:46,250
What? As if it's hard
to change a plan within days.

830
00:37:46,730 --> 00:37:48,050
You can't accuse me of plagiarism

831
00:37:48,050 --> 00:37:49,410
just because you guys can't do it.

832
00:37:49,970 --> 00:37:51,410
You guys can do that in only a few days?

833
00:37:52,290 --> 00:37:53,410
You must be a prodigy.

834
00:37:53,410 --> 00:37:54,890
What a shame it must be for you

835
00:37:55,290 --> 00:37:56,330
to compete against us here
for venture capital.

836
00:37:57,050 --> 00:37:58,050
What's the point

837
00:37:58,050 --> 00:37:59,330
of arguing?

838
00:37:59,930 --> 00:38:01,770
The only thing
that matters is winning and losing.

839
00:38:01,970 --> 00:38:02,850
You should know

840
00:38:03,130 --> 00:38:04,970
that only winners get all the rights.

841
00:38:05,290 --> 00:38:06,290
Losers

842
00:38:06,650 --> 00:38:07,570
are the fakes.

843
00:38:08,490 --> 00:38:09,970
You cheated, and you still think
you did nothing wrong!

844
00:38:09,970 --> 00:38:11,050
Who do you think you're shoving?

845
00:38:12,250 --> 00:38:13,250
What are you trying to do?

846
00:38:14,770 --> 00:38:16,010
Don't break the peace.

847
00:38:17,930 --> 00:38:19,370
If memory serves me right,

848
00:38:19,370 --> 00:38:21,930
Ji Junxing
is the main creator, isn't he?

849
00:38:24,330 --> 00:38:25,610
He is enjoying his meat.

850
00:38:25,610 --> 00:38:26,730
What are you guys doing?

851
00:38:26,730 --> 00:38:27,930
Why are you guys
kicking up such a huge fuss?

852
00:38:43,450 --> 00:38:44,850
You're right.

853
00:38:46,010 --> 00:38:47,010
It is my business.

854
00:38:47,010 --> 00:38:47,650
Isn't it?

855
00:38:51,170 --> 00:38:51,730
Get him!

856
00:38:52,970 --> 00:38:53,650
You plagiarizer!

857
00:38:53,650 --> 00:38:54,210
Stop fighting!

858
00:38:54,210 --> 00:38:54,770
Fight!

859
00:38:57,520 --> 00:38:59,240
(Police)

860
00:39:08,530 --> 00:39:09,410
Ji Junxing.

861
00:39:15,450 --> 00:39:16,330
Assaulting others.

862
00:39:16,570 --> 00:39:17,610
What a sore loser you are.

863
00:39:18,250 --> 00:39:19,490

00:39:19,490 --> 00:39:20,770
you can steal everything

00:39:20,770 --> 00:39:22,170
I spent over a year to create
in just a few days?

00:39:23,330 --> 00:39:25,250
Don't make false accusations
without evidence.

867
00:39:25,770 --> 00:39:26,330
This time

868
00:39:26,570 --> 00:39:28,130
I let you off

869
00:39:28,330 --> 00:39:29,050
because we're once neighbors.

870
00:39:29,930 --> 00:39:32,050
You won't be so lucky next time.

871
00:39:32,930 --> 00:39:33,890
You want proof?

872
