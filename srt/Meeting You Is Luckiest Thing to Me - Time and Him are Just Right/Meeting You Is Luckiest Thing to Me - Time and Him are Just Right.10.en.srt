17
00:01:42,751 --> 00:01:43,351
Good morning.

18
00:01:43,551 --> 00:01:44,071
Good morning.

19
00:01:44,151 --> 00:01:45,231
Good morning.

20
00:01:57,140 --> 00:02:01,490
(Second Semester of Grade 2)

21
00:02:06,951 --> 00:02:07,991
I heard that you went to Lin Xi's place

22
00:02:07,991 --> 00:02:08,511
this winter break

23
00:02:08,511 --> 00:02:09,271
and you stayed in her house too.

24
00:02:09,271 --> 00:02:09,951
For real?

25
00:02:10,871 --> 00:02:11,631
Xie Ang.

26
00:02:12,071 --> 00:02:13,031
Loose lips.

27
00:02:13,471 --> 00:02:14,231
Not me.

28
00:02:14,231 --> 00:02:14,831
My lips are tight.

29
00:02:14,831 --> 00:02:16,071
Why would I let the cat out of the bag?

30
00:02:16,711 --> 00:02:18,471
When you came to my house
to copy the answer,

31
00:02:18,471 --> 00:02:19,751
you said he was pestering

32
00:02:19,751 --> 00:02:20,471
and begging

33
00:02:20,751 --> 00:02:21,871
for Lin Xi's forgiveness.

34
00:02:22,671 --> 00:02:23,431
Did I?

35
00:02:23,431 --> 00:02:24,711
What a pitiful and pathetic story.

36
00:02:25,271 --> 00:02:26,031
Momo.

37
00:02:26,031 --> 00:02:27,191
Am I sinful to finish all your snacks

38
00:02:27,191 --> 00:02:27,911
and got the toilet clogged?

39
00:02:27,911 --> 00:02:29,231
Why are you slandering me?

40
00:02:29,231 --> 00:02:30,311
I trust Chen Mo.

41
00:02:30,311 --> 00:02:31,151
He never lies.

42
00:02:33,031 --> 00:02:34,631
What has happened to you and Lin Xi?

43
00:02:35,031 --> 00:02:36,791
Our misunderstanding is cleared up.

44
00:02:37,111 --> 00:02:38,191
We are back to how we were before.

45
00:02:39,231 --> 00:02:40,751
We have started anew.

46
00:02:41,911 --> 00:02:42,631
What does that mean?

47
00:02:42,631 --> 00:02:43,831
Did you fight again?

48
00:02:44,111 --> 00:02:45,031
No.

49
00:02:45,271 --> 00:02:46,271
I've been considering

50
00:02:46,271 --> 00:02:47,631
lately

51
00:02:48,071 --> 00:02:50,031
that I forced him to befriend me

52
00:02:50,031 --> 00:02:51,631
because I thought my brother's heart

53
00:02:51,631 --> 00:02:52,311
was donated to him.

54
00:02:53,231 --> 00:02:53,871
True.

55
00:02:54,311 --> 00:02:55,951
Since it was a mistake,

56
00:02:55,951 --> 00:02:57,711
there is no need to stay too close
to him.

57
00:02:58,711 --> 00:03:00,511
I want to get to know

58
00:03:00,511 --> 00:03:02,031
the real Ji Junxing

59
00:03:02,031 --> 00:03:02,831
without my brother's influence.

60
00:03:07,831 --> 00:03:08,551
Good morning.

61
00:03:08,871 --> 00:03:09,791
Good morning.

62
00:03:12,351 --> 00:03:13,551
Are you in the wrong seat?

63
00:03:13,871 --> 00:03:15,311
I have told Miss Sun

64
00:03:15,311 --> 00:03:16,231
that I will exchange the seat with you.

65
00:03:16,471 --> 00:03:17,911
You will sit with Ji Junxing
from now on.

66
00:03:29,831 --> 00:03:30,351
Do you find something weird

67
00:03:30,351 --> 00:03:31,591
is going on between them?

68
00:03:31,671 --> 00:03:32,991
They even changed their seats away
from each other.

69
00:03:33,831 --> 00:03:35,471
I thought I have figured out something

70
00:03:36,151 --> 00:03:37,591
but it seemed I did not.

71
00:03:39,231 --> 00:03:39,991
In my opinion,

72
00:03:40,831 --> 00:03:42,631
they are too polite to each other.

73
00:03:43,191 --> 00:03:45,631
I can feel a sense of alienation.

74
00:03:45,871 --> 00:03:48,231
I feel a sense of weirdness.

75
00:03:49,031 --> 00:03:50,871
I feel a sense of gossip.

76
00:03:51,551 --> 00:03:53,671
And I sense a team of gossipers
beside me.

77
00:03:54,631 --> 00:03:55,231
Disperse.

78
00:03:55,231 --> 00:03:55,871
Nothing is wrong with them.

79
00:03:59,431 --> 00:04:00,231
Lin Xi.

80
00:04:00,791 --> 00:04:01,511
Yes?

81
00:04:01,751 --> 00:04:03,031
You better come with me.

82
00:04:05,351 --> 00:04:06,351
Come with me.

83
00:04:06,471 --> 00:04:07,711
What has happened?

84
00:04:13,880 --> 00:04:15,440
(Song Linxue)

85
00:04:16,911 --> 00:04:17,471
Hello.

86
00:04:20,431 --> 00:04:21,511
What's going on now?

87
00:04:21,511 --> 00:04:21,911
What's the hurry?

88
00:04:21,911 --> 00:04:22,791
It's Kai.

89
00:04:23,031 --> 00:04:23,831
Qin Kai?

90
00:04:24,191 --> 00:04:25,191
What has happened to him?

91
00:04:25,191 --> 00:04:26,231
He will get held back another year.

92
00:04:26,511 --> 00:04:27,071
Mr. Wu

93
00:04:27,071 --> 00:04:28,591
said his result is really bad.

94
00:04:28,911 --> 00:04:29,591
If he remains

95
00:04:29,591 --> 00:04:31,391
in the last thirty
after the coming monthly test,

96
00:04:31,391 --> 00:04:32,551
he will get held back another year.

97
00:04:32,791 --> 00:04:34,191
It's my first time seeing him so sad.

98
00:04:34,471 --> 00:04:35,671
He even cries his eyes out.

99
00:04:36,031 --> 00:04:37,111
Does he cry?

100
00:04:38,191 --> 00:04:39,551
Well, I will go now.

101
00:04:41,151 --> 00:04:41,671
Where are the eye drops?

102
00:04:41,671 --> 00:04:42,471
Give me some more.

103
00:04:42,471 --> 00:04:43,151
Some more.

104
00:04:46,071 --> 00:04:46,551
It's cool.

105
00:04:46,551 --> 00:04:47,431
Some more.

106
00:04:48,591 --> 00:04:49,271
Do I look sad now?

107
00:04:49,831 --> 00:04:51,071
No one can be more pitiful than you.

108
00:04:51,071 --> 00:04:52,351
You almost got me

109
00:04:52,351 --> 00:04:53,591
if I didn't know you were acting.

110
00:04:53,591 --> 00:04:55,111
Kai, are you serious about this?

111
00:04:55,551 --> 00:04:56,031
Do you have a mirror?

112
00:04:56,031 --> 00:04:56,591
Give it to me.

113
00:04:59,231 --> 00:05:00,231
This doesn't work though.

114
00:05:00,231 --> 00:05:00,791
Did you buy

115
00:05:00,791 --> 00:05:01,911
the tear stick I mentioned?

116
00:05:01,911 --> 00:05:02,431
There is it.

117
00:05:03,551 --> 00:05:04,311
Give it to me.

118
00:05:04,311 --> 00:05:05,031
I do it myself.

119
00:05:09,711 --> 00:05:10,471
It burns.

120
00:05:10,471 --> 00:05:12,031
So, it's more effective.

121
00:05:19,871 --> 00:05:20,471
How do I look now?

122
00:05:26,551 --> 00:05:27,471
He's standing by the window.

123
00:05:35,591 --> 00:05:36,391
Are you all right?

124
00:05:38,271 --> 00:05:39,111
Fine.

125
00:05:39,751 --> 00:05:40,391
Did you cry?

126
00:05:42,351 --> 00:05:42,991
I'm fine.

127
00:05:43,751 --> 00:05:45,191
Just leave me alone.

128
00:05:45,831 --> 00:05:46,391
Sure.

129
00:05:47,831 --> 00:05:48,991
Don't go.

130
00:05:49,231 --> 00:05:50,351
Aren't you saying something to me?

131
00:05:50,991 --> 00:05:52,311
Repeating the grade isn't
something serious.

132
00:05:52,311 --> 00:05:53,071
Why are you so sad?

133
00:05:53,471 --> 00:05:55,591
Repeating a grade isn't serious?

134
00:05:57,511 --> 00:05:59,631
Actually, I have some advice for you.

135
00:06:00,071 --> 00:06:00,991
You can

136
00:06:00,991 --> 00:06:02,191
make use of this opportunity

137
00:06:02,191 --> 00:06:03,271
to start learning the lessons

138
00:06:03,271 --> 00:06:04,111
from Grade 1's syllabus

139
00:06:04,391 --> 00:06:05,831
for the sake
of firm knowledge fundamental.

140
00:06:07,231 --> 00:06:08,911
I didn't see this coming.

141
00:06:09,471 --> 00:06:10,391
Mr. Wu

142
00:06:10,391 --> 00:06:11,511
has good reasons.

143
00:06:11,511 --> 00:06:13,071
You have to understand why he did so.

144
00:06:13,471 --> 00:06:15,511
It's worth it to use one year

145
00:06:15,911 --> 00:06:16,711
for a brand new future.

146
00:06:17,751 --> 00:06:19,111
Hey, don't.

147
00:06:19,111 --> 00:06:20,751
Don't give up on me.

148
00:06:20,751 --> 00:06:22,311
I'm not hopeless.

149
00:06:24,711 --> 00:06:25,471
What about this?

150
00:06:26,711 --> 00:06:27,831
You help me with the revision.

151
00:06:28,551 --> 00:06:29,511
If my result improves,

152
00:06:29,791 --> 00:06:30,991
I won't get held back then.

153
00:06:32,591 --> 00:06:33,551
Where's your result form?

154
00:06:33,551 --> 00:06:34,111
It's over here.

155
00:06:37,151 --> 00:06:38,151
Chinese Literature, fifty-one.

156
00:06:38,151 --> 00:06:39,271
Maths, forty-nine.

157
00:06:39,271 --> 00:06:40,311
English, fifty-five.

158
00:06:40,311 --> 00:06:42,311
Three subjects of arts comprehensive,
ninety-seven.

159
00:06:44,071 --> 00:06:45,991
I never expected your marks
could be that low.

160
00:06:45,991 --> 00:06:47,151
I'm afraid you have to start
with the syllabus

161
00:06:47,151 --> 00:06:47,991
from junior high.

162
00:06:48,351 --> 00:06:49,391
It is going to be
a more laborious effort

163
00:06:49,711 --> 00:06:50,871
than the moon landing.

164
00:06:51,671 --> 00:06:53,191
Armstrong managed to land on the moon

165
00:06:53,191 --> 00:06:54,951
despite the far distance.

166
00:06:54,951 --> 00:06:55,271
Lin Xi.

167
00:06:55,271 --> 00:06:57,191
Please help me with the revision.

168
00:06:57,751 --> 00:06:58,191
You know, Liu Bei.

169
00:06:58,551 --> 00:06:59,791
Liu Bei managed to establish
the Shu state

170
00:06:59,791 --> 00:07:01,031
after he met with Zhuge Liang.

171
00:07:01,031 --> 00:07:01,751
And also

172
00:07:01,751 --> 00:07:02,511
that fellow,

173
00:07:02,511 --> 00:07:03,551
Guan Zhong

174
00:07:03,551 --> 00:07:04,751
met with Bao Yashu.

175
00:07:04,751 --> 00:07:05,591
It's Bao Shuya.

176
00:07:09,871 --> 00:07:11,111
Whatever, they are the same.

177
00:07:11,111 --> 00:07:12,351
What I'm trying to say

178
00:07:12,911 --> 00:07:14,671
is that Qin Kai can only improve better

179
00:07:14,671 --> 00:07:16,151
if he meets with Miss Lin Xi.

180
00:07:18,071 --> 00:07:19,591
This is a sudden request.

181
00:07:19,591 --> 00:07:21,191
As for being responsible to you,

182
00:07:21,191 --> 00:07:22,191
I need time to consider it.

183
00:07:24,391 --> 00:07:25,631
You have no time to think about it.

184
00:07:25,631 --> 00:07:26,951
I will meet you tonight.

185
00:07:27,511 --> 00:07:28,111
I will come.

186
00:07:46,431 --> 00:07:47,271
Thank you.

187
00:07:56,151 --> 00:07:56,871
Why do you look for me?

188
00:07:56,871 --> 00:07:57,711
Nothing.

189
00:08:00,471 --> 00:08:01,391
My father registered

190
00:08:01,391 --> 00:08:03,031
for a pre-exam training camp
in Jingzhou.

191
00:08:03,391 --> 00:08:04,191
I'm leaving tomorrow.

192
00:08:05,231 --> 00:08:06,151
All of the sudden?

193
00:08:07,711 --> 00:08:08,631
Yes.

194
00:08:11,431 --> 00:08:14,511
So, I would like to make things clear
to you

195
00:08:14,791 --> 00:08:16,791
before I leave.

196
00:08:18,071 --> 00:08:20,551
I heard that Lin Xi and you are
on bad terms

197
00:08:20,551 --> 00:08:22,111
because of what I said.

198
00:08:25,231 --> 00:08:26,231
It wasn't your problem.

199
00:08:26,951 --> 00:08:28,751
We have solved the misunderstanding
between us.

200
00:08:29,951 --> 00:08:30,911
Don't mind it.

201
00:08:34,511 --> 00:08:35,391
Anyway,

202
00:08:36,511 --> 00:08:37,751
if possible,

203
00:08:37,991 --> 00:08:39,991
please send my apology to Lin Xi.

204
00:08:41,751 --> 00:08:43,231
After all, I made use of her kindness

205
00:08:43,631 --> 00:08:45,191
on new year's eve.

206
00:08:45,191 --> 00:08:46,111
I'm to blame.

207
00:08:48,111 --> 00:08:48,991
She is outspoken

208
00:08:49,271 --> 00:08:50,351
and unconcerned.

209
00:08:50,951 --> 00:08:52,591
She won't dwell on

210
00:08:53,751 --> 00:08:54,871
sad things.

211
00:08:55,071 --> 00:08:55,871
No worries.

212
00:08:57,431 --> 00:08:58,071
Glad to know that.

213
00:09:02,871 --> 00:09:03,431
Well.

214
00:09:04,631 --> 00:09:06,031
That's all from me.

215
00:09:06,471 --> 00:09:07,351
Since I've said goodbye to you,

216
00:09:08,431 --> 00:09:09,151
I'm leaving.

217
00:09:19,431 --> 00:09:20,551
Do take care of yourself well

218
00:09:21,111 --> 00:09:22,151
in Jingzhou.

219
00:09:23,111 --> 00:09:24,111
Don't get hurt

220
00:09:26,271 --> 00:09:27,671
and eat good food there.

221
00:09:37,671 --> 00:09:38,671
All right.

222
00:09:39,231 --> 00:09:40,311
I didn't know

223
00:09:40,311 --> 00:09:41,431
you were so naggy.

224
00:09:44,071 --> 00:09:44,551
I'm off.

225
00:09:59,151 --> 00:10:00,351
Honestly,

226
00:10:01,991 --> 00:10:02,391
there is one thing

227
00:10:02,391 --> 00:10:03,991
I want to tell you.

228
00:10:05,151 --> 00:10:05,831
Go ahead.

229
00:10:08,351 --> 00:10:10,711
I don't like gummy bears anymore.

230
00:10:14,191 --> 00:10:17,311
It sounds like a good decision.

231
00:10:23,151 --> 00:10:23,751
Goodbye.

232
00:10:26,071 --> 00:10:26,711
Goodbye.

233
00:10:44,071 --> 00:10:46,071
Thirty-minute break before
the self-study session.

234
00:10:46,071 --> 00:10:47,111
Students who stay at home may leave now.

235
00:10:47,111 --> 00:10:48,311
Get home safely.

236
00:10:48,951 --> 00:10:50,951
- Thank you, Miss Sun.
- Thank you, Miss Sun.

237
00:10:53,071 --> 00:10:54,271
I'm off, Lin Xi.

238
00:10:55,551 --> 00:10:56,311
All right.

239
00:10:56,311 --> 00:10:57,151
I'm off.

240
00:10:57,231 --> 00:10:58,231
Bye-bye.

241
00:10:58,751 --> 00:10:59,631
Come on.

242
00:11:07,231 --> 00:11:08,031
Why are you still here?

243
00:11:09,031 --> 00:11:10,671
Your class is on the left side
after the exit.

244
00:11:13,151 --> 00:11:14,311
This is the place I come for.

245
00:11:14,631 --> 00:11:15,631
I came for Miss Lin Xi

246
00:11:16,191 --> 00:11:17,191
to study together.

247
00:11:17,191 --> 00:11:18,591
I promised Qin Kai to help him
with the revision.

248
00:11:18,591 --> 00:11:20,391
He will get held back
if he fails again.

249
00:11:22,271 --> 00:11:23,471
Helping him with the revision
at this hour?

250
00:11:23,471 --> 00:11:24,191
Are you sure?

251
00:11:27,951 --> 00:11:29,031
Fine. I will wait for you.

252
00:11:29,511 --> 00:11:30,551
Let's go home together.

253
00:11:32,231 --> 00:11:33,871
Don't tell me you didn't know

254
00:11:33,871 --> 00:11:35,591
that Lin Xi has already moved
to the dormitory.

255
00:11:36,231 --> 00:11:38,031
I will spend more time with Lin Xi

256
00:11:38,031 --> 00:11:39,991
to go to school together

257
00:11:39,991 --> 00:11:41,951
and study together at night.

258
00:11:43,631 --> 00:11:45,151
When did you move to the dormitory?

259
00:11:45,991 --> 00:11:47,111
Does my mum know about it?

260
00:11:47,711 --> 00:11:48,551
Yes, she did.

261
00:11:48,551 --> 00:11:49,871
She helped me with the luggage.

262
00:11:50,111 --> 00:11:50,831
We agreed

263
00:11:50,831 --> 00:11:52,311
that I would stay at your home
for just one semester.

264
00:11:52,311 --> 00:11:53,831
The warden told me there was a room
available,

265
00:11:53,831 --> 00:11:54,871
so I moved in.

266
00:11:58,991 --> 00:12:00,071
Student,

267
00:12:00,071 --> 00:12:01,951
you better get home early.

268
00:12:01,951 --> 00:12:03,951
The school gate is closing soon.

269
00:12:09,151 --> 00:12:09,711
You!

270
00:12:12,191 --> 00:12:13,231
Study well.

271
00:12:18,591 --> 00:12:19,431
What do you come here for?

272
00:12:19,831 --> 00:12:21,071
To study.

273
00:12:32,591 --> 00:12:33,151
Mum.

274
00:12:33,591 --> 00:12:34,831
I have something to discuss with you.

275
00:13:02,591 --> 00:13:03,311
Lin Xi.

276
00:13:03,911 --> 00:13:05,511
I can't solve this question.

277
00:13:05,511 --> 00:13:06,431
Please teach me again.

278
00:13:06,631 --> 00:13:08,151
I've explained it to you three times.

279
00:13:08,431 --> 00:13:09,631
Pollution of rives.

280
00:13:09,631 --> 00:13:11,471
It's mentioned at the beginning.

281
00:13:12,431 --> 00:13:13,111
Choose D.

282
00:13:16,911 --> 00:13:18,391
This is the most basic question.

283
00:13:19,311 --> 00:13:19,951
Fine.

284
00:13:20,431 --> 00:13:21,591
Clever clogs.

285
00:13:21,591 --> 00:13:22,151
Well.

286
00:13:23,151 --> 00:13:24,071
Tell me

287
00:13:24,071 --> 00:13:25,591
what's the average annual temperature

288
00:13:25,591 --> 00:13:27,191
in Rostov-on-Don?

289
00:13:28,671 --> 00:13:29,671
What?

290
00:13:31,391 --> 00:13:32,271
No idea?

291
00:13:32,751 --> 00:13:33,231
Never think

292
00:13:33,231 --> 00:13:34,991
that you're well-versed
in every subject.

293
00:13:34,991 --> 00:13:36,231
Everyone has their own expertise.

294
00:13:36,231 --> 00:13:36,911
Understood?

295
00:13:37,671 --> 00:13:39,351
Five to fourteen degrees.

296
00:13:41,271 --> 00:13:42,351
Five to fourteen degrees.

297
00:13:42,791 --> 00:13:43,871
You even knew this?

298
00:13:44,711 --> 00:13:46,071
I've studied this place
for travelling purposes.

299
00:13:48,791 --> 00:13:50,071
Fine. Good for you.

300
00:13:50,071 --> 00:13:50,911
Do you know peanuts

301
00:13:50,911 --> 00:13:51,831
aren't originated from China

302
00:13:51,831 --> 00:13:52,951
but from South America?

303
00:13:52,951 --> 00:13:54,031
Do you know Furnace Creek

304
00:13:54,031 --> 00:13:55,231
of California in America

305
00:13:55,231 --> 00:13:56,271
recorded as the hottest temperate
in the world?

306
00:13:56,431 --> 00:13:57,631
Do you know what's the biggest bird

307
00:13:57,631 --> 00:13:58,271
in this world?

308
00:13:58,271 --> 00:13:59,711
What's the smallest butterfly?

309
00:13:59,751 --> 00:14:01,151
You may know Mount Everest

310
00:14:01,151 --> 00:14:02,271
is the highest peak in the world,

311
00:14:02,271 --> 00:14:03,471
what about

312
00:14:03,471 --> 00:14:04,071
the second highest peak?

313
00:14:04,071 --> 00:14:04,991
I bet you don't know.

314
00:14:06,551 --> 00:14:07,191
As for those,

315
00:14:07,711 --> 00:14:08,791
I have no idea.

316
00:14:10,831 --> 00:14:11,751
I know.

317
00:14:13,591 --> 00:14:14,431
I know.

318
00:14:14,871 --> 00:14:16,231
Both of you are insulting
my shallow knowledge

319
00:14:16,231 --> 00:14:17,831
with the knowledge bowl.

320
00:14:18,671 --> 00:14:20,191
Two knowledgeable masters,

321
00:14:20,191 --> 00:14:21,671
I shall not disturb your study.

322
00:14:22,071 --> 00:14:22,871
A stupid student like me

323
00:14:22,871 --> 00:14:24,071
should go to bed now.

324
00:14:29,711 --> 00:14:30,311
Lin Xi, wait for me.

325
00:14:30,311 --> 00:14:31,151
Let me see you off.

326
00:14:41,591 --> 00:14:43,151
Thank you for showering me
with knowledge.

327
00:14:43,151 --> 00:14:43,671
See you.

328
00:14:43,951 --> 00:14:45,751
See you tomorrow.

329
00:14:50,111 --> 00:14:51,351
You even outshine

330
00:14:51,351 --> 00:14:52,831
the master of face-changing.

331
00:14:53,631 --> 00:14:54,591
You did well too.

332
00:14:55,151 --> 00:14:56,351
Making up a lie

333
00:14:56,351 --> 00:14:57,431
that you will get held back.

334
00:14:57,791 --> 00:14:59,071
Lin Xi is too kind

335
00:14:59,431 --> 00:15:00,231
to blow your cover.

336
00:15:00,551 --> 00:15:01,431
Join the club.

337
00:15:01,431 --> 00:15:02,591
Let's see who can do better.

338
00:15:11,671 --> 00:15:12,751
What's wrong with you?

339
00:15:12,751 --> 00:15:13,991
Are you going back to the dorm with me?

340
00:15:13,991 --> 00:15:15,071
Are you the gum on a shoe?

341
00:15:18,391 --> 00:15:19,951
I can walk you to your dorm too.

342
00:15:33,431 --> 00:15:34,631
When did he move in?

343
00:15:35,151 --> 00:15:36,351
He came right after you.

344
00:15:36,351 --> 00:15:37,191
Why asked me?

345
00:15:37,511 --> 00:15:38,631
Don't you know who he is?

346
00:15:41,151 --> 00:15:41,631
I do.

347
00:15:41,711 --> 00:15:43,151
Then, why did you let him in?

348
00:15:43,591 --> 00:15:44,391
Wait, Kai.

349
00:15:44,671 --> 00:15:46,231
Even you can't handle him,

350
00:15:46,231 --> 00:15:47,111
I can't do better then.

351
00:15:47,471 --> 00:15:48,471
You have to deal with this yourself.

352
00:15:53,111 --> 00:15:53,911
A word.

353
00:15:55,831 --> 00:15:56,671
What do you want?

354
00:15:56,671 --> 00:15:57,671
Why do you move in?

355
00:15:58,431 --> 00:15:59,991
Because I want to.

356
00:15:59,991 --> 00:16:01,071
No reasons.

357
00:16:01,391 --> 00:16:02,831
I don't want to stay together with you.

358
00:16:03,951 --> 00:16:05,031
Neither do I.

359
00:16:08,791 --> 00:16:09,671
Let's make a bet.

360
00:16:10,511 --> 00:16:11,271
On what?

361
00:16:12,631 --> 00:16:14,031
Since you are a top student,

362
00:16:14,031 --> 00:16:15,231
let's compete on the test results.

363
00:16:15,231 --> 00:16:15,911
Whoever makes the most progress

364
00:16:15,911 --> 00:16:17,431
in the upcoming monthly test wins.

365
00:16:17,951 --> 00:16:18,991
If I win,

366
00:16:18,991 --> 00:16:19,911
you move out.

367
00:16:20,191 --> 00:16:21,991
If otherwise, you can stay here.

368
00:16:23,151 --> 00:16:25,031
You do have a quick wit.

369
00:16:25,431 --> 00:16:27,191
The scores of your six subjects don't
sum up to make one subject of mine.

370
00:16:27,711 --> 00:16:29,071
You have a large room for progress.

371
00:16:29,351 --> 00:16:30,991
Why? Don't dare to take on
this challenge?

372
00:16:31,271 --> 00:16:33,311
If you have no guts,
you can alter the rules.

373
00:16:35,951 --> 00:16:37,671
No need. That's it.

374
00:17:40,991 --> 00:17:43,071
Five yuan for one bowl of beef noodles.

375
00:17:43,351 --> 00:17:45,151
Four yuan for hot and sour noodles.

376
00:17:45,631 --> 00:17:47,551
3.5 yuan for soybean milk
and deep-fried dough sticks.

377
00:17:48,911 --> 00:17:50,071
One yuan for two buns.

378
00:17:51,791 --> 00:17:52,991
I better take the bun.

379
00:17:54,391 --> 00:17:55,111
Hello, madam.

380
00:17:55,111 --> 00:17:56,111
One bun, please.

381
00:17:56,111 --> 00:17:57,551
Just one?

382
00:17:57,551 --> 00:17:58,831
Yes, one bun.

383
00:17:59,351 --> 00:18:00,231
And a box of milk,

384
00:18:00,231 --> 00:18:00,751
one tea-boiled egg,

385
00:18:00,751 --> 00:18:01,711
and one hot and sour noodles.

386
00:18:02,111 --> 00:18:02,831
It's on me.

387
00:18:03,511 --> 00:18:05,471
You are my saviour.

388
00:18:05,471 --> 00:18:06,671
Thank you so much.

389
00:18:06,911 --> 00:18:07,671
Hurry up, madam.

390
00:18:07,671 --> 00:18:08,471
I'm hungry.

391
00:18:10,151 --> 00:18:12,151
So, this is how a rich man feels.

392
00:18:13,911 --> 00:18:15,831
It has been a while
since I've had a big meal like this.

393
00:18:18,231 --> 00:18:20,191
How much money have you saved
for concert tickets?

394
00:18:20,591 --> 00:18:21,911
I just started

395
00:18:21,911 --> 00:18:22,711
saving money for it.

396
00:18:22,711 --> 00:18:24,191
I have to lower Engel's Coefficient
on my food expenses.

397
00:18:24,191 --> 00:18:25,031
No.

398
00:18:25,031 --> 00:18:26,351
You can't starve yourself
because of the concert.

399
00:18:26,751 --> 00:18:27,591
Come to me if you have no money.

400
00:18:27,591 --> 00:18:28,271
I have a lot on the card.

401
00:18:28,271 --> 00:18:28,831
Use my card.

402
00:18:28,831 --> 00:18:29,311
Buy anything you want.

403
00:18:29,671 --> 00:18:30,791
You can use mine too.

404
00:18:31,111 --> 00:18:32,191
Blimey.

405
00:18:32,191 --> 00:18:34,231
You all are so generous to lend me
your helping hands.

406
00:18:34,231 --> 00:18:35,471
I'm so touched.

407
00:18:35,471 --> 00:18:36,871
Is anything special about today?

408
00:18:37,111 --> 00:18:37,671
Even Ji Junxing

409
00:18:37,671 --> 00:18:39,391
comes to the canteen
in this early morning.

410
00:18:39,591 --> 00:18:40,151
Can't I

411
00:18:40,151 --> 00:18:41,551
show up there at this hour?

412
00:18:41,751 --> 00:18:42,751
Aren't you always having breakfast

413
00:18:42,751 --> 00:18:43,711
at home?

414
00:18:44,911 --> 00:18:45,911
I forgot to tell you this.

415
00:18:45,911 --> 00:18:46,671
I stay in the dorm now.

416
00:18:46,751 --> 00:18:47,991
I moved in yesterday.

417
00:18:48,031 --> 00:18:49,671
Why is it so sudden?

418
00:18:50,751 --> 00:18:51,551
Because it needs thirty to forty minutes

419
00:18:51,551 --> 00:18:53,311
of travelling time if I stay at home.

420
00:18:53,311 --> 00:18:54,151
It's a waste of time.

421
00:18:54,431 --> 00:18:55,831
I shall save up the time

422
00:18:55,831 --> 00:18:56,711
to study.

423
00:18:57,671 --> 00:18:59,431
Top student,
you are striving really hard.

424
00:19:00,751 --> 00:19:03,431
After all, I still have a long way to go
before reaching my goal.

425
00:19:05,111 --> 00:19:06,031
I need to work harder.

426
00:19:20,631 --> 00:19:22,151
Kai, are you just sitting here idly?

427
00:19:22,471 --> 00:19:23,231
If I were you,

428
00:19:23,591 --> 00:19:24,431
I will rush towards them

429
00:19:24,751 --> 00:19:25,951
and take Lin Xi away.

430
00:19:26,431 --> 00:19:29,471
It's never too late for a gentleman
to take revenge.

431
00:19:30,751 --> 00:19:31,551
Bring it on.

432
00:19:33,751 --> 00:19:34,511
Bring it on.

433
00:19:37,831 --> 00:19:39,671
Hey. What are you doing?

434
00:19:39,671 --> 00:19:40,671
I said, bring it on.

435
00:19:45,671 --> 00:19:48,391
I said bring it on, the vocabulary.

436
00:19:48,391 --> 00:19:49,511
The vocabulary.

437
00:19:49,511 --> 00:19:50,111
Can you put your brain

438
00:19:50,111 --> 00:19:51,871
into good use?

439
00:19:52,351 --> 00:19:53,631
You should've said it clearly

440
00:19:53,631 --> 00:19:54,631
and I wouldn't be confused then.

441
00:19:59,791 --> 00:20:00,711
Faster.

442
00:20:00,711 --> 00:20:02,031
The vocabulary is leaving my memory.

443
00:20:06,911 --> 00:20:07,631
They are all squiggles.

444
00:20:07,871 --> 00:20:08,711
They may know me,

445
00:20:08,711 --> 00:20:09,711
but I don't.

446
00:20:11,591 --> 00:20:12,671
Read the first one.

447
00:20:23,991 --> 00:20:25,271
Even the first one is hard.

448
00:20:25,271 --> 00:20:25,951
Kai.

449
00:20:25,951 --> 00:20:26,911
The vocabulary I know

450
00:20:26,911 --> 00:20:27,711
is way fewer than you.

451
00:20:29,951 --> 00:20:31,031
Don't you know

452
00:20:31,031 --> 00:20:32,231
the Mandarin characters beside it?

453
00:20:32,231 --> 00:20:33,351
Can you read Mandarin?

454
00:20:36,711 --> 00:20:37,271
Give up.

455
00:20:37,311 --> 00:20:38,671
When did I say I want to give up?

456
00:20:39,591 --> 00:20:41,111
Kai, you asked me to read
the Mandarin characters.

457
00:20:41,391 --> 00:20:42,511
The first phrase is 'give up'.

458
00:20:42,511 --> 00:20:43,911
Look at this.

459
00:20:44,471 --> 00:20:46,271
Jeez.

460
00:20:46,951 --> 00:20:47,631
Useless.

461
00:20:47,631 --> 00:20:48,551
I can do better with myself.

462
00:20:53,631 --> 00:20:54,151
Come in.

463
00:20:57,631 --> 00:20:58,231
Mr. Wu.

464
00:20:58,951 --> 00:20:59,671
What's the matter?

465
00:21:00,351 --> 00:21:00,911
Nothing.

466
00:21:00,911 --> 00:21:02,391
I just want to ask

467
00:21:02,711 --> 00:21:04,831
if it's possible for me to surpass
Ji Junxing

468
00:21:04,831 --> 00:21:05,511
with my result.

469
00:21:07,431 --> 00:21:08,231
No.

470
00:21:08,791 --> 00:21:10,031
I mean

471
00:21:10,031 --> 00:21:11,711
in the terms of mark improvement,

472
00:21:11,711 --> 00:21:12,951
can I surpass him in this regard?

473
00:21:16,711 --> 00:21:17,351
Of course.

474
00:21:18,071 --> 00:21:20,231
After all, we believe in miracles,
right?

475
00:21:20,511 --> 00:21:21,471
Not really.

476
00:21:21,951 --> 00:21:22,791
If Ji Junxing

477
00:21:22,791 --> 00:21:24,671
does well in the Chinese essay,

478
00:21:24,671 --> 00:21:26,231
his marks can improve by twenty
to thirty marks.

479
00:21:27,431 --> 00:21:29,871
Unless he is absent during the test
or messes up the test.

480
00:21:29,991 --> 00:21:31,391
You may stand a chance to win.

481
00:21:32,111 --> 00:21:34,671
Absent? Mess up?

482
00:21:35,951 --> 00:21:36,791
Good idea.

483
00:21:36,791 --> 00:21:37,831
Thank you, Miss Sun.

484
00:21:40,031 --> 00:21:41,351
What's going on, Mr. Wu?

485
00:21:42,511 --> 00:21:43,391
No worries.

486
00:21:43,391 --> 00:21:45,071
Though he is naughty,

487
00:21:45,071 --> 00:21:46,471
he has a kind soul.

488
00:21:49,151 --> 00:21:51,151
I suggest you believe in truth
rather than miracles.

489
00:21:51,151 --> 00:21:52,871
The result of your class stands out

490
00:21:52,871 --> 00:21:55,111
because you always trust miracles
blindly.

491
00:21:56,391 --> 00:21:57,511
Fine.

492
00:21:57,511 --> 00:21:58,871
You are right about everything.

493
00:22:05,711 --> 00:22:06,631
Miss Sun.

494
00:22:07,071 --> 00:22:08,751
When are we going on a date?

495
00:22:22,951 --> 00:22:23,671
Let's play a game.

496
00:22:27,111 --> 00:22:27,551
Sure.

497
00:22:27,871 --> 00:22:29,391
If you insist, I'm in.

498
00:22:30,671 --> 00:22:32,471
Knowledge bowl again?

499
00:22:32,471 --> 00:22:32,991
Yes.

500
00:22:33,271 --> 00:22:33,711
I want to invite you

501
00:22:33,711 --> 00:22:34,911
to be the judge.

502
00:22:38,631 --> 00:22:40,031
Sure. I will join you.

503
00:22:40,431 --> 00:22:42,591
We need some kind of punishment
for the loser.

504
00:22:45,271 --> 00:22:45,951
Stick papers on the face?

505
00:22:47,391 --> 00:22:48,391
That's boring.

506
00:22:49,311 --> 00:22:50,271
Forehead flick?

507
00:22:50,831 --> 00:22:51,991
Anything more creative?

508
00:22:52,311 --> 00:22:53,351
You suggest one then.

509
00:23:02,431 --> 00:23:03,351
I know it.

510
00:23:10,791 --> 00:23:11,711
Wuziqi chess.

511
00:23:12,911 --> 00:23:13,831
Ji Junxing won.

512
00:23:18,191 --> 00:23:19,951
Let's continue.

513
00:23:20,191 --> 00:23:21,551
Three, two, one, stop.

514
00:23:23,151 --> 00:23:24,791
Rubik's cube, Qin Kai won.

515
00:23:27,471 --> 00:23:28,071
Calling it a quit?

516
00:23:29,711 --> 00:23:30,191
No.

517
00:23:30,551 --> 00:23:31,711
A horse in white is a white horse.

518
00:23:31,711 --> 00:23:32,671
A horse in black is a black horse.

519
00:23:32,671 --> 00:23:33,911
A horse covered with black
and white strips is a zebra.

520
00:23:33,911 --> 00:23:35,271
What about the horse covered

521
00:23:35,271 --> 00:23:36,511
with black, white and red stripes?

522
00:23:39,271 --> 00:23:40,431
Does that even exist?

523
00:23:46,151 --> 00:23:46,951
What's it?

524
00:23:48,951 --> 00:23:50,231
A blushing zebra.

525
00:23:51,511 --> 00:23:52,671
That's lame.

526
00:23:53,991 --> 00:23:55,031
Next question.

527
00:23:55,031 --> 00:23:57,071
A mantis invites a centipede
and a lizard to its house.

528
00:23:57,071 --> 00:23:58,751
When the mantis is cooking,
it realises the soy sauce isn't enough.

529
00:23:58,751 --> 00:24:00,111
Hence, the centipede volunteers
to buy it

530
00:24:00,111 --> 00:24:01,591
yet it never comes back.

531
00:24:01,591 --> 00:24:02,231
Why is it so?

532
00:24:02,711 --> 00:24:03,791
Someone steps on it.

533
00:24:03,791 --> 00:24:04,591
Violent. Wrong.

534
00:24:05,791 --> 00:24:06,791
It is eaten by a snake.

535
00:24:09,031 --> 00:24:10,311
Because it's still wearing shoes.

536
00:24:12,671 --> 00:24:13,591
Gosh.

537
00:24:15,391 --> 00:24:16,391
The third question.

538
00:24:16,391 --> 00:24:17,911
Fried chicken and Coke
go through security together,

539
00:24:17,911 --> 00:24:19,471
but why only Coke was held back?

540
00:24:19,791 --> 00:24:20,551
Coke is liquid,

541
00:24:20,551 --> 00:24:21,511
the Coke has to be tested
before security.

542
00:24:22,031 --> 00:24:23,471
Coke bottle is too fat to go through.

543
00:24:23,471 --> 00:24:24,031
No.

544
00:24:28,671 --> 00:24:30,791
Only auto gate can pass security check.
[*Note: Fried chicken and auto gate sounds alike in Mandarin]

545
00:24:31,911 --> 00:24:33,311
Homophonic pun?

546
00:24:34,071 --> 00:24:35,471
Both of you are wrong, anyway.

547
00:24:48,231 --> 00:24:49,271
I never expected

548
00:24:49,271 --> 00:24:50,791
this moment will occur one day.

549
00:24:52,711 --> 00:24:53,551
You can sleep

550
00:24:53,551 --> 00:24:55,551
with your chalk-ash head.

551
00:25:04,671 --> 00:25:05,391
What's wrong with you?

552
00:25:06,391 --> 00:25:07,351
I'm sorry.

553
00:25:07,711 --> 00:25:08,711
I couldn't see because of the water.

554
00:25:08,711 --> 00:25:09,911
I thought it was my tap.

555
00:25:10,231 --> 00:25:11,191
I will adjust it.

556
00:25:11,191 --> 00:25:11,631
All right?

557
00:25:12,031 --> 00:25:12,631
It's done.

558
00:25:22,671 --> 00:25:23,831
What are you up to?

559
00:25:24,151 --> 00:25:25,911
I thought you prefer cold water.

560
00:25:25,911 --> 00:25:26,591
Come on.

561
00:25:39,071 --> 00:25:40,671
Madam, two drumsticks,

562
00:25:40,671 --> 00:25:41,671
two stewed meatballs

563
00:25:41,671 --> 00:25:42,871
and two sweet and sour pork tenderloins.

564
00:25:42,871 --> 00:25:43,391
Sure.

565
00:25:45,631 --> 00:25:46,711
Overdrawn.

566
00:25:48,991 --> 00:25:49,711
Overdrawn.

567
00:25:49,751 --> 00:25:50,831
Do you still want it?

568
00:25:56,031 --> 00:25:57,591
I'm sorry.

569
00:25:58,271 --> 00:26:00,631
We want two servings of rice.

570
00:26:01,471 --> 00:26:02,711
Madam, don't shake the ladle, please.

571
00:26:14,071 --> 00:26:15,191
I'm sorry

572
00:26:15,191 --> 00:26:16,391
to make you broke.

573
00:26:16,391 --> 00:26:17,111
It's fine.

574
00:26:17,511 --> 00:26:18,391
Are you full?

575
00:26:18,951 --> 00:26:20,311
Not really.

576
00:26:20,311 --> 00:26:21,151
What about you?

577
00:26:21,511 --> 00:26:23,111
Me neither.

578
00:26:25,191 --> 00:26:26,551
Any money left?

579
00:26:34,911 --> 00:26:35,951
We can buy a pack of biscuits.

580
00:26:37,031 --> 00:26:38,591
You are insensitive to the price,

581
00:26:38,591 --> 00:26:39,871
yet you keep saying that you want
to start up a business.

582
00:26:40,191 --> 00:26:40,951
What do you mean?

583
00:26:41,351 --> 00:26:42,271
The price rises.

584
00:26:42,271 --> 00:26:43,511
Not only the biscuits,

585
00:26:43,511 --> 00:26:45,151
all chocolate, spicy gluten
and soft drinks

586
00:26:45,151 --> 00:26:46,111
have been

587
00:26:46,111 --> 00:26:47,511
doubled the price.

588
00:26:48,591 --> 00:26:49,351
Doubled the price?

589
00:26:53,991 --> 00:26:54,511
Jiang Yimian.

590
00:26:54,831 --> 00:26:55,751
I have a plan.

591
00:26:56,551 --> 00:26:57,551
A plan to buy the biscuits

592
00:26:57,551 --> 00:26:58,551
with one yuan?

593
00:26:58,551 --> 00:26:59,351
Let's think wider.

594
00:26:59,711 --> 00:27:01,191
I see a method that can provide
our daily meals

595
00:27:01,471 --> 00:27:02,311
with meat

596
00:27:02,311 --> 00:27:03,711
let alone the instant noodles.

597
00:27:04,031 --> 00:27:06,071
Instead of tightening your belt
for the concert ticket,

598
00:27:06,071 --> 00:27:07,711
why don't you make some money?

599
00:27:08,191 --> 00:27:08,831
What do you mean?

600
00:27:09,151 --> 00:27:10,191
The snack bar at my place

601
00:27:10,191 --> 00:27:11,551
sells instant noodles at one yuan each

602
00:27:11,551 --> 00:27:12,551
and ten packs at a wholesale price

603
00:27:12,551 --> 00:27:13,751
which is 0.75 yuan each.

604
00:27:14,031 --> 00:27:15,311
If we sell it at 1.50 yuan,

605
00:27:15,671 --> 00:27:16,711
the net profit is 0.75 yuan.

606
00:27:17,271 --> 00:27:18,751
If we sell twenty packets per day,

607
00:27:18,751 --> 00:27:19,831
100 packets in a week

608
00:27:19,831 --> 00:27:21,151
and 400 packets in a month.

609
00:27:21,831 --> 00:27:22,751
And we can earn 300 yuan in total.

610
00:27:23,631 --> 00:27:24,791
Aside from the instant noodles,

611
00:27:24,791 --> 00:27:25,831
we can sell milk,

612
00:27:25,831 --> 00:27:26,711
chocolate and spicy gluten too.

613
00:27:27,351 --> 00:27:29,111
We will get over one thousand yuan
in just one month.

614
00:27:29,711 --> 00:27:31,111
You are quick-witted.

615
00:27:32,071 --> 00:27:33,511
Do you want to be my hostess?

616
00:27:33,751 --> 00:27:34,831
We can run the snack bar together.

617
00:27:35,591 --> 00:27:37,031
I will handle the business deals

618
00:27:37,391 --> 00:27:38,191
and you collect the money.

619
00:27:38,991 --> 00:27:40,191
How dare you make me pay the money

620
00:27:40,191 --> 00:27:41,831
with myself in return?

621
00:27:42,951 --> 00:27:44,431
Have you gathered enough money
for the concert ticket?

622
00:27:45,631 --> 00:27:46,311
Deal.

623
00:27:48,831 --> 00:27:49,231
Good morning, Mr. Xie.

624
00:27:49,231 --> 00:27:49,711
Good morning.

625
00:27:49,711 --> 00:27:50,391
I have got so many stocks.

626
00:27:50,391 --> 00:27:51,191
It's going to be lucrative.

627
00:27:51,191 --> 00:27:51,831
Of course.

628
00:27:52,431 --> 00:27:53,511
That's your father.

629
00:27:53,711 --> 00:27:54,111
Good morning.

630
00:27:54,111 --> 00:27:55,071
- Good morning, Mr. Xie.
- Good morning, Mr. Xie.

631
00:27:55,391 --> 00:27:56,191
Hurry up and go upstairs.

632
00:27:56,391 --> 00:27:57,471
What do we do now?

633
00:27:57,471 --> 00:27:58,071
Let's hide.

634
00:27:58,071 --> 00:27:58,711
Faster.

635
00:27:58,711 --> 00:27:59,591
Run.

636
00:27:59,791 --> 00:28:00,871
Faster.

637
00:28:01,431 --> 00:28:01,631
What do we do now?

638
00:28:01,631 --> 00:28:02,791
Chop-chop.

639
00:28:02,791 --> 00:28:03,711
You are going to be late.

640
00:28:04,671 --> 00:28:05,351
What should we do now?

641
00:28:05,351 --> 00:28:06,711
We can't walk past him like this.

642
00:28:09,031 --> 00:28:09,871
It's Lin Xi.

643
00:28:10,631 --> 00:28:11,231
Lin Xi.

644
00:28:11,231 --> 00:28:12,031
Lin Xi, Gao Yunlang.

645
00:28:16,231 --> 00:28:17,311
Come here.

646
00:28:18,911 --> 00:28:20,231
Why are you hiding here?

647
00:28:21,111 --> 00:28:22,151
You have put on so much weight

648
00:28:22,431 --> 00:28:23,351
just after one night.

649
00:28:23,591 --> 00:28:24,591
Stop poking.

650
00:28:24,631 --> 00:28:25,711
What's it you are hiding?

651
00:28:26,231 --> 00:28:27,151
Come closer.

652
00:28:31,751 --> 00:28:32,671
That's a lot.

653
00:28:32,951 --> 00:28:34,031
And here too.

654
00:28:34,031 --> 00:28:34,831
We have ready the snacks

655
00:28:34,831 --> 00:28:36,071
for the whole class.

656
00:28:36,071 --> 00:28:37,471
We would entrust you

657
00:28:37,471 --> 00:28:38,871
with all of our property.

658
00:28:38,871 --> 00:28:39,591
You mustn't let them

659
00:28:39,591 --> 00:28:41,071
fall pray into my father's hands.

660
00:28:41,151 --> 00:28:42,431
I'm counting on you.

661
00:28:45,551 --> 00:28:48,791
We will try our best.

662
00:28:51,991 --> 00:28:52,671
Be quick.

663
00:28:53,111 --> 00:28:54,391
The class is going to start.

664
00:28:56,391 --> 00:28:57,151
Walk faster.

665
00:28:59,351 --> 00:29:00,711
Faster.

666
00:29:00,711 --> 00:29:02,311
You are going to be late.

667
00:29:08,671 --> 00:29:09,511
Good morning, Mr. Xie.

668
00:29:09,511 --> 00:29:10,311
Good morning.

669
00:29:10,311 --> 00:29:10,951
- Good morning, Mr. Xie.
- Good morning, Mr. Xie.

670
00:29:10,951 --> 00:29:11,711
Hurry up and go up.

671
00:29:15,231 --> 00:29:16,191
How do I look now?
It is not obvious, right?

672
00:29:16,191 --> 00:29:17,031
Good.

673
00:29:17,031 --> 00:29:17,791
Walk slowly.

674
00:29:17,791 --> 00:29:18,431
Don't make any noise.

675
00:29:26,431 --> 00:29:27,431
Good morning, Mr. Xie.

676
00:29:27,431 --> 00:29:28,151
Good morning, dad.

677
00:29:28,151 --> 00:29:29,391
Are you waiting for those latecomers?

678
00:29:31,711 --> 00:29:32,351
Freeze.

679
00:29:37,951 --> 00:29:38,911
Xie Ang.

680
00:29:43,951 --> 00:29:45,351
You are hiding something from me.

681
00:29:47,031 --> 00:29:48,271
Dad, actually...

682
00:29:48,271 --> 00:29:49,351
Yesterday night,

683
00:29:49,711 --> 00:29:50,751
did you read magazines again

684
00:29:50,751 --> 00:29:52,231
during the self-study session?

685
00:29:52,551 --> 00:29:54,071
I've seen it from the window.

686
00:29:54,351 --> 00:29:55,311
Dad, it wasn't a magazine.

687
00:29:55,311 --> 00:29:56,511
I was reading the financial...

688
00:29:57,871 --> 00:29:58,431
I'm sorry, dad.

689
00:29:58,431 --> 00:29:59,711
I won't do it again.

690
00:30:01,511 --> 00:30:03,431
Mr. Xie, do you have anything else
to tell us?

691
00:30:03,431 --> 00:30:04,671
We have to rush

692
00:30:04,671 --> 00:30:05,751
for the self-study session.

693
00:30:07,031 --> 00:30:07,831
Hurry up and go ahead.

694
00:30:08,471 --> 00:30:09,471
Thank you, Mr. Xie.

695
00:30:24,351 --> 00:30:25,991
What a big business.

696
00:30:25,991 --> 00:30:27,111
Of course.

697
00:30:27,111 --> 00:30:28,511
After all, our short-term goal

698
00:30:28,511 --> 00:30:30,511
is to be the top snack bar in Chunhui.

699
00:30:30,711 --> 00:30:32,951
As for the long-term goal,
we want to ring the Nasdaq bell.

700
00:30:32,951 --> 00:30:33,471
Exactly.

701
00:30:34,831 --> 00:30:36,671
I know Xie Ang can't think
with his right mind.

702
00:30:36,991 --> 00:30:38,351
I didn't know you were the same too,
Jiang Yimian.

703
00:30:39,031 --> 00:30:40,471
When Jobs was creating Apple,

704
00:30:40,471 --> 00:30:41,831
he had been looked down upon

705
00:30:41,831 --> 00:30:42,551
by crude people like you too.

706
00:30:42,551 --> 00:30:44,231
All you know is studying
during high school time,

707
00:30:44,231 --> 00:30:46,471
but we can foresee
the business potential here.

708
00:30:49,231 --> 00:30:50,311
We have ready stock for snacks.

709
00:30:50,311 --> 00:30:52,151
Come and get your share.

710
00:30:52,151 --> 00:30:54,111
All snacks are on sale
at rock-bottom prices.

711
00:30:54,111 --> 00:30:55,511
30 per cent off. Come on.

712
00:31:00,311 --> 00:31:01,551
Five yuan for fries.

713
00:31:01,551 --> 00:31:02,671
Five yuan.

714
00:31:04,591 --> 00:31:06,031
Two yuan for this.

715
00:31:06,351 --> 00:31:07,511
Not this one.

716
00:31:08,311 --> 00:31:09,511
Five yuan for this.

717
00:31:09,991 --> 00:31:10,871
Calm down.

718
00:31:10,871 --> 00:31:11,751
Please line up.

719
00:31:11,751 --> 00:31:12,591
Line up.

720
00:31:15,471 --> 00:31:16,071
Ten.

721
00:31:16,511 --> 00:31:18,951
Twenty, thirty, forty, fifty,

722
00:31:18,951 --> 00:31:20,231
sixty, seventy, eighty, ninety.

723
00:31:20,471 --> 00:31:21,431
Two hundred.

724
00:31:21,831 --> 00:31:22,831
That's a lot.

725
00:31:22,831 --> 00:31:23,591
How do we split the money?

726
00:31:25,231 --> 00:31:26,711
You can have it all.

727
00:31:28,231 --> 00:31:29,151
All?

728
00:31:30,551 --> 00:31:32,391
You are so sensible.

729
00:31:34,791 --> 00:31:37,871
My dad's money is taken care of
by my mum.

730
00:31:38,391 --> 00:31:39,351
If your dad allows this,

731
00:31:39,351 --> 00:31:40,911
I can take care of his money too.

732
00:31:42,351 --> 00:31:43,351
But I have no interest

733
00:31:43,351 --> 00:31:44,311
to be your stepmother.

734
00:31:51,871 --> 00:31:52,871
Didn't you realise

735
00:31:52,871 --> 00:31:54,431
someone in East Gate Squad
is absent?

736
00:31:54,951 --> 00:31:55,791
Oh, right.

737
00:32:09,071 --> 00:32:10,111
Are you aware

738
00:32:10,111 --> 00:32:11,871
that I'm the future of China's
Field and Track team?

739
00:32:13,271 --> 00:32:14,031
As if.

740
00:32:24,271 --> 00:32:24,711
Hello.

741
00:32:25,911 --> 00:32:27,391
Miss Sun said you have a fever.

742
00:32:27,391 --> 00:32:28,631
She asked me to pay you a visit

743
00:32:28,631 --> 00:32:29,551
on behalf of the class.

744
00:32:32,111 --> 00:32:32,511
No need.

745
00:32:32,831 --> 00:32:33,951
I will attend the class later.

746
00:32:34,471 --> 00:32:36,431
Don't you bring harm to our class.

747
00:32:36,511 --> 00:32:37,631
Miss Sun entrusted me

748
00:32:37,631 --> 00:32:38,671
to bring you some medicine.

749
00:32:39,151 --> 00:32:40,311
I'm at the entrance of your dorm.

750
00:32:40,751 --> 00:32:42,431
All right, give me a second.

751
00:32:42,431 --> 00:32:43,231
I will come right away.

752
00:32:48,871 --> 00:32:49,391
Where are you going?

753
00:32:50,031 --> 00:32:50,671
Who was on the phone?

754
00:32:52,071 --> 00:32:52,951
Lin Xi

755
00:32:53,311 --> 00:32:54,031
bought me some medicine.

756
00:33:08,951 --> 00:33:09,671
Lin Xi.

757
00:33:10,111 --> 00:33:11,431
How come you are injured too?

758
00:33:11,431 --> 00:33:12,551
I sprained my foot.

759
00:33:12,551 --> 00:33:13,151
Look.

760
00:33:13,471 --> 00:33:14,511
My foot is swollen up this big.

761
00:33:14,831 --> 00:33:15,431
Wait.

762
00:33:15,871 --> 00:33:17,911
What was going on yesterday night?

763
00:33:18,031 --> 00:33:19,031
Don't overthink.

764
00:33:19,551 --> 00:33:20,391
You can't just rest in the dorm

765
00:33:20,391 --> 00:33:21,191
like this.

766
00:33:21,271 --> 00:33:22,471
You have to go to the infirmary.

767
00:33:24,231 --> 00:33:25,111
Lin Xi.

768
00:33:25,671 --> 00:33:26,671
You have got him

769
00:33:26,671 --> 00:33:27,871
the cold medicine.

770
00:33:28,071 --> 00:33:28,831
You must take me

771
00:33:28,831 --> 00:33:30,511
to the infirmary too.

772
00:33:32,471 --> 00:33:33,551
Isn't this foot sprained?

773
00:33:34,471 --> 00:33:35,111
This side.

774
00:33:41,111 --> 00:33:41,671
I will take him there.

775
00:33:41,671 --> 00:33:42,431
What are you up to?

776
00:33:46,111 --> 00:33:47,831
What are you up to?

777
00:33:50,200 --> 00:33:52,100
(Medical Room)

778
00:33:52,231 --> 00:33:55,151
Doctor, he is burning up seriously.

779
00:33:55,151 --> 00:33:56,551
He needs an intravenous drip now.

780
00:33:56,911 --> 00:33:58,791
Doctor, his sprained foot is swollen up
like a trotter.

781
00:33:58,791 --> 00:33:59,631
He needs an amputation.

782
00:33:59,871 --> 00:34:00,711
Quiet.

783
00:34:03,591 --> 00:34:04,191
Doctor,

784
00:34:04,631 --> 00:34:06,271
please handle them well.

785
00:34:06,711 --> 00:34:07,311
Sure.

786
00:34:37,871 --> 00:34:38,591
It's weird.

787
00:34:39,671 --> 00:34:40,911
He was burning up just now.

788
00:34:46,391 --> 00:34:47,391
You are up?

789
00:34:47,631 --> 00:34:48,591
How do you feel now?

790
00:34:54,631 --> 00:34:55,311
I'm feeling better now.

791
00:34:58,671 --> 00:34:59,311
Good.

792
00:35:15,991 --> 00:35:17,191
Do you have time this Friday?

793
00:35:18,511 --> 00:35:19,591
My family wants to see you.

794
00:35:20,311 --> 00:35:21,271
Who is it?

795
00:35:21,871 --> 00:35:22,511
My little brother.

796
00:35:22,511 --> 00:35:23,631
He came back from overseas.

797
00:35:24,351 --> 00:35:25,511
Ji Luchi?

798
00:35:25,511 --> 00:35:26,391
Is he back?

799
00:35:26,471 --> 00:35:27,831
Yes. He wants to meet with you.

800
00:35:28,271 --> 00:35:29,951
Do you want to come over?

801
00:35:29,951 --> 00:35:31,271
Yes, of course.

802
00:35:58,950 --> 00:36:00,750
(Monthly Test)

803
00:36:00,831 --> 00:36:02,231
All right, stop writing.

804
00:36:02,231 --> 00:36:03,231
Pass up your paper.

805
00:36:03,591 --> 00:36:05,391
Pass your paper from the back row.

806
00:36:16,991 --> 00:36:17,551
Wait.

807
00:36:17,551 --> 00:36:18,231
Let me check again

808
00:36:18,231 --> 00:36:19,751
if I wrote 'proved'
for all the questions.

809
00:36:20,351 --> 00:36:21,711
That takes up one mark.

810
00:36:26,191 --> 00:36:27,151
Actually,

811
00:36:27,471 --> 00:36:28,911
you should 'answer' instead.

812
00:36:31,111 --> 00:36:33,071
You should've told me just now.

813
00:36:35,511 --> 00:36:36,271
Why didn't you tell me too?

814
00:36:36,471 --> 00:36:37,311
I don't know either.

815
00:36:43,511 --> 00:36:44,191
Stop flipping.

816
00:36:44,191 --> 00:36:45,591
You're on the last page.

817
00:36:45,591 --> 00:36:46,231
I know.

818
00:36:47,031 --> 00:36:48,391
715th.

819
00:36:51,711 --> 00:36:53,151
But you did pretty well this time.

820
00:36:53,391 --> 00:36:54,911
You've improved by thirty-five marks.

821
00:36:55,111 --> 00:36:55,911
Of course.

822
00:36:56,231 --> 00:36:57,271
I did study seriously

823
00:36:57,271 --> 00:36:58,191
for several weeks.

824
00:36:58,991 --> 00:37:00,031
What about Ji Junxing?

825
00:37:01,751 --> 00:37:02,551
Stop flipping.

826
00:37:02,551 --> 00:37:03,431
He's on the first page.

827
00:37:08,311 --> 00:37:09,671
715 marks.

828
00:37:10,591 --> 00:37:11,191
His score

829
00:37:11,191 --> 00:37:13,071
is the same as my rank number.

830
00:37:13,871 --> 00:37:14,871
Impressive.

831
00:37:15,551 --> 00:37:16,471
How many marks did he improve?

832
00:37:17,591 --> 00:37:18,391
Thirty-six.

833
00:37:20,671 --> 00:37:21,991
Because he wrote enough words

834
00:37:21,991 --> 00:37:23,271
for the essay this time.

835
00:37:23,511 --> 00:37:24,591
Argh.

836
00:37:24,591 --> 00:37:26,151
I have to stay with him
for another year and a half.

837
00:37:27,191 --> 00:37:27,951
I will get going.

838
00:37:30,191 --> 00:37:30,951
Little brat.

839
00:37:37,431 --> 00:37:38,231
Jiang Yimian.

840
00:37:38,991 --> 00:37:39,791
Where is Lin Xi?

841
00:37:40,271 --> 00:37:41,591
She has left with Ji Junxing.

842
00:37:41,831 --> 00:37:42,671
Where to?

843
00:37:44,511 --> 00:37:45,631
No rush.

844
00:37:45,631 --> 00:37:46,551
When one is in a hurry,

845
00:37:46,551 --> 00:37:47,631
he tends to get agitated.

846
00:37:47,631 --> 00:37:48,431
If so,

847
00:37:48,431 --> 00:37:49,591
he will need some herbal tea.

848
00:37:50,631 --> 00:37:52,511
Fine, give me two.

849
00:37:52,511 --> 00:37:53,111
Ten yuan.

850
00:37:54,431 --> 00:37:55,351
Twenty yuan for you.

851
00:37:55,351 --> 00:37:56,391
Can you tell me now?

852
00:37:57,271 --> 00:37:58,391
They went to Ji Junxing's house.

853
00:37:58,391 --> 00:37:59,671
Because his little brother is back

854
00:37:59,671 --> 00:38:00,791
and he wants to meet with Lin Xi.

855
00:38:00,791 --> 00:38:02,511
When does he have a little brother?

856
00:38:02,511 --> 00:38:03,431
How come everyone in his family

857
00:38:03,431 --> 00:38:04,471
wants to see Lin Xi?

858
00:38:05,191 --> 00:38:06,111
Well.

859
00:38:06,111 --> 00:38:07,911
You can ask Lin Xi yourself.

860
00:38:08,231 --> 00:38:08,911
Anyway,

861
00:38:08,911 --> 00:38:11,351
you are just one step behind them.

862
00:38:13,391 --> 00:38:14,271
They are still around here.

863
00:38:16,871 --> 00:38:17,671
Lin Xi.

864
00:38:19,071 --> 00:38:20,111
She's booked.

865
00:38:27,871 --> 00:38:28,671
Do you think

866
00:38:28,911 --> 00:38:29,551
your brother

867
00:38:29,551 --> 00:38:30,991
will like my present?

868
00:38:32,871 --> 00:38:33,391
What should I say to him

869
00:38:33,391 --> 00:38:34,871
when we first meet?

870
00:38:35,591 --> 00:38:37,111
What's your brother's favourite food?

871
00:38:38,431 --> 00:38:40,231
Should I buy some food for him?

872
00:38:41,271 --> 00:38:42,871
Why are you so excited?

873
00:38:43,071 --> 00:38:44,231
You were calm

874
00:38:44,231 --> 00:38:45,871
when you first saw me though.

875
00:38:45,871 --> 00:38:46,831
Nonsense.

876
00:38:46,831 --> 00:38:47,951
I was more excited

877
00:38:47,951 --> 00:38:48,631
than I am now.

878
00:38:48,631 --> 00:38:49,511
I restrained myself so much

879
00:38:49,511 --> 00:38:50,951
when I rushed over to hug you.

880
00:38:51,031 --> 00:38:52,191
You must control yourself then.

881
00:38:52,311 --> 00:38:53,551
My dad is back.

882
00:38:53,711 --> 00:38:55,271
He's kind of a strict man.

883
00:38:55,271 --> 00:38:56,751
Don't you scare him.

884
00:38:58,031 --> 00:38:58,751
I must control myself.

885
00:38:59,831 --> 00:39:01,351
Calm down.

886
00:39:02,031 --> 00:39:02,991
I shouldn't scare him.

887
00:39:04,071 --> 00:39:04,951
