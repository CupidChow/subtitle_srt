21
00:01:49,240 --> 00:01:50,480
over the past seventy-five years,

22
00:01:50,600 --> 00:01:52,120
those fervent times

23
00:01:52,360 --> 00:01:54,400
would adorn our school with glory.

24
00:01:56,200 --> 00:01:57,520
How is it? Is everything ready?

25
00:01:57,840 --> 00:01:59,280
We have rehearsed it many times.

26
00:01:59,280 --> 00:02:00,200
We guarantee that you...

27
00:02:00,200 --> 00:02:01,240
No, we guarantee that she

28
00:02:01,240 --> 00:02:02,720
will be the brightest one.

29
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:04,720
You better not ruin it like last time.

30
00:02:04,720 --> 00:02:05,560
No worries, Kai.

31
00:02:07,640 --> 00:02:08,480
- We're off.
- Go.

00:02:18,960 --> 00:02:20,960
- Wish you a good night.
- A good night.

35
00:02:29,160 --> 00:02:30,060
Tonight's performance was good.

36
00:02:30,060 --> 00:02:32,000
Right, the last performance

37
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:32,380
was quite creative.

38
00:02:33,320 --> 00:02:34,180
Don't you think Ji Junxing

39
00:02:34,340 --> 00:02:36,620
did a great job as the emcee?

40
00:02:36,760 --> 00:02:38,360
I was moved by what he said just now.

41
00:02:38,360 --> 00:02:39,160
Well.

42
00:02:39,360 --> 00:02:39,660
I haven't started

43
00:02:39,660 --> 00:02:41,100
the English review given by Miss Sun.

44
00:02:41,100 --> 00:02:43,420
I'm going to burn the midnight oil
tonight.

45
00:02:44,200 --> 00:02:46,100
Jiang Yimian, let's do it together.

46
00:02:46,100 --> 00:02:47,820
I won't despise you
even though you are bad at English.

47
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:50,280
But I despise you as a person.

48
00:02:51,840 --> 00:02:52,320
Xie Ang.

49
00:02:52,320 --> 00:02:52,760
It's fine.

50
00:02:52,760 --> 00:02:54,080
Look at his face.

51
00:02:56,600 --> 00:02:57,400
Is it a blackout?

52
00:02:57,960 --> 00:03:00,000
Would it be the surprise event
of the gala night?

53
00:03:00,560 --> 00:03:01,920
It's too good to be true.

54
00:03:01,920 --> 00:03:03,000
Why not?

55
00:03:08,240 --> 00:03:08,960
What's going on?

56
00:03:09,520 --> 00:03:10,240
What?

57
00:03:13,920 --> 00:03:15,240
Right. Look for Lin Xi.

58
00:03:16,200 --> 00:03:16,680
Good.

59
00:03:19,840 --> 00:03:21,120
What's going on now?

60
00:03:24,880 --> 00:03:25,480
Lin Xi.

61
00:03:26,560 --> 00:03:28,280
It seems that the light is for you.

62
00:03:31,800 --> 00:03:32,680
Lin Xi.

63
00:03:47,800 --> 00:03:49,280
You look pretty

64
00:03:49,280 --> 00:03:50,200
under the limelight.

65
00:03:51,160 --> 00:03:52,320
Is it you?

66
00:03:52,320 --> 00:03:52,960
Yes.

67
00:03:53,200 --> 00:03:54,200
Didn't you say

68
00:03:54,200 --> 00:03:55,680
Ji Junxing and Song Linxue look gorgeous

69
00:03:55,680 --> 00:03:57,240
under the limelight?

70
00:03:57,720 --> 00:03:59,560
So, I cut the power

71
00:03:59,560 --> 00:04:00,400
and asked Black Bull and the rest

72
00:04:00,400 --> 00:04:02,040
to be the light-chasers.

73
00:04:02,320 --> 00:04:03,240
You can experience

74
00:04:03,240 --> 00:04:04,560
how it feels standing
under the limelight.

75
00:04:04,560 --> 00:04:05,160
How do you feel now?

76
00:04:05,160 --> 00:04:05,920
It is good, right?

77
00:04:05,920 --> 00:04:06,800
I was just saying.

78
00:04:06,800 --> 00:04:07,880
Why make a big deal out of it?

79
00:04:07,880 --> 00:04:09,200
Aren't you afraid of being caught
by Mr. Xie?

80
00:04:11,600 --> 00:04:12,280
Yes, I do.

81
00:04:12,720 --> 00:04:15,240
Before he comes,

82
00:04:15,640 --> 00:04:17,320
I must tell you everything.

83
00:04:18,520 --> 00:04:19,600
What is it?

84
00:04:24,440 --> 00:04:26,520
Actually, I didn't prepare
a beautiful speech.

85
00:04:26,760 --> 00:04:29,920
Also, this idea came out on a whim.

86
00:04:31,520 --> 00:04:32,840
It was because

87
00:04:32,840 --> 00:04:34,480
I noticed you were upset

88
00:04:34,480 --> 00:04:35,680
at backstage just now.

89
00:04:36,040 --> 00:04:38,280
I couldn't guess

90
00:04:38,600 --> 00:04:39,840
what made you feel upset.

91
00:04:40,840 --> 00:04:41,560
But,

92
00:04:41,960 --> 00:04:43,880
I'm willing to try my very best

93
00:04:44,600 --> 00:04:46,000
to make you happy.

94
00:04:51,560 --> 00:04:52,720
Ostentatious.

95
00:04:54,680 --> 00:04:55,480
Lin Xi.

96
00:04:55,600 --> 00:04:57,440
I want you to stand under the limelight.

97
00:04:58,280 --> 00:05:00,520
However, to me,

98
00:05:00,960 --> 00:05:02,720
regardless of whether you standing
in a bright place or not,

99
00:05:02,960 --> 00:05:04,040
you are always glowing

100
00:05:04,240 --> 00:05:05,640
in my eyes.

101
00:05:08,040 --> 00:05:09,040
Because

102
00:05:10,840 --> 00:05:11,400
I...

103
00:05:11,400 --> 00:05:13,160
Why gather over there?

104
00:05:13,280 --> 00:05:15,000
Qin Kai. It is you, again.

105
00:05:15,080 --> 00:05:16,320
I'm going to punish you.

106
00:05:16,320 --> 00:05:17,040
Mr. Xie is here.

107
00:05:17,040 --> 00:05:17,760
Run.

108
00:05:19,640 --> 00:05:20,400
Mr. Xie is here.

109
00:05:20,600 --> 00:05:21,080
Lin Xi.

110
00:05:22,680 --> 00:05:23,400
Lin Xi.

111
00:05:24,240 --> 00:05:24,720
Lin Xi.

112
00:05:24,840 --> 00:05:25,320
Lin Xi.

113
00:05:25,720 --> 00:05:26,200
Lin Xi.

114
00:05:26,200 --> 00:05:27,800
Run. Faster.

115
00:05:27,800 --> 00:05:28,480
Lin Xi.

116
00:05:28,960 --> 00:05:29,840
Let's leave.

117
00:05:29,840 --> 00:05:30,520
Lin Xi.

118
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:31,760
Come with me.

119
00:05:31,920 --> 00:05:33,320
Let's leave.

120
00:05:44,800 --> 00:05:46,480
(Next, I'm going to make an announcement.)

121
00:05:47,200 --> 00:05:50,000
Yesterday night, Qin Kai
from Class Twelve of Grade Two

122
00:05:50,440 --> 00:05:51,640
shut off the electricity in the school

123
00:05:51,640 --> 00:05:53,160
for the light show performance.

124
00:05:53,880 --> 00:05:56,280
This is bad conduct

125
00:05:56,600 --> 00:05:58,240
and has violated the school disciple.

126
00:05:59,080 --> 00:06:00,400
(Therefore, I render him reprimand.)

127
00:06:00,720 --> 00:06:02,640
(This is also a warning for all students.)

128
00:06:14,320 --> 00:06:15,040
Qin Kai.

129
00:06:16,360 --> 00:06:17,000
I came here...

130
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:18,120
To comfort me.

131
00:06:19,080 --> 00:06:20,120
How do you know?

132
00:06:20,680 --> 00:06:22,520
I can tell from your face.

133
00:06:26,320 --> 00:06:27,560
Don't be nervous.

134
00:06:28,360 --> 00:06:29,560
We can get on well

135
00:06:29,560 --> 00:06:30,720
like we used to previously.

136
00:06:31,280 --> 00:06:32,280
Do you mean it?

137
00:06:33,720 --> 00:06:34,680
You have moved on already?

138
00:06:35,600 --> 00:06:36,600
But,

139
00:06:36,600 --> 00:06:38,280
if you regret your decision

140
00:06:38,280 --> 00:06:39,720
and want to develop
a deeper relationship with me,

141
00:06:39,720 --> 00:06:40,880
I agree with you too.

142
00:06:42,360 --> 00:06:43,400
You can crack jokes now.

143
00:06:43,400 --> 00:06:44,480
I'm relieved then.

144
00:06:44,480 --> 00:06:45,360
I couldn't sleep well yesterday

145
00:06:45,360 --> 00:06:46,480
as I worried that you might be upset.

146
00:06:46,760 --> 00:06:48,360
I was confusing how to reject you.

147
00:06:48,880 --> 00:06:50,080
How considerate of you.

148
00:06:50,400 --> 00:06:50,960
Come on.

149
00:06:50,960 --> 00:06:52,320
Share with me.

150
00:06:52,840 --> 00:06:53,560
No.

151
00:06:53,920 --> 00:06:54,960
Please.

152
00:06:55,440 --> 00:06:56,080
No.

153
00:06:56,080 --> 00:06:56,800
Tell me.

154
00:06:57,160 --> 00:06:57,760
Wait for me.

155
00:06:59,080 --> 00:07:00,440
Just tell me.

156
00:07:01,320 --> 00:07:02,440
Hey, tell me.

157
00:07:03,640 --> 00:07:04,320
I was wondering

158
00:07:04,320 --> 00:07:05,680
what would happen
between you and Qin Kai.

159
00:07:05,680 --> 00:07:07,080
Yet, you have nipped the possibility
between you.

160
00:07:07,440 --> 00:07:08,600
That's regret.

161
00:07:09,040 --> 00:07:09,920
Nothing to regret.

162
00:07:10,320 --> 00:07:11,280
This is like different arrangements

163
00:07:11,280 --> 00:07:12,480
of carbon elements

164
00:07:12,480 --> 00:07:13,800
forming different isoforms.

165
00:07:14,120 --> 00:07:15,520
If the arrangement forms
in the right mode,

166
00:07:15,520 --> 00:07:16,520
it will be a diamond.

167
00:07:16,520 --> 00:07:17,760
If not,

168
00:07:17,760 --> 00:07:18,800
it will be graphite.

169
00:07:21,200 --> 00:07:22,320
May I ask

170
00:07:22,880 --> 00:07:24,440
if you both are still on good terms?

171
00:07:24,440 --> 00:07:25,760
Can you talk as usual?

172
00:07:26,320 --> 00:07:27,560
We are still good friends.

173
00:07:28,680 --> 00:07:29,760
I'm relieved to hear that.

174
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:32,520
This is the interview plan.

175
00:07:34,560 --> 00:07:35,600
The school wants to launch

176
00:07:35,600 --> 00:07:36,960
the booklet for promoting
the school anniversary.

177
00:07:37,240 --> 00:07:38,240
(School Anniversary Promotion)
The names in the table

178
00:07:38,240 --> 00:07:38,920
are excellent representatives

179
00:07:38,920 --> 00:07:40,360
in their fields.

180
00:07:40,360 --> 00:07:42,400
I have to do the photoshoot
and interview with them

181
00:07:42,400 --> 00:07:43,760
for the sake of the booklet.

182
00:07:43,760 --> 00:07:45,720
Song Linxue, Ji Junxing,

183
00:07:45,720 --> 00:07:46,280
(Song Linxue; Ji Junxing,
Top Student of the Grade)

184
00:07:46,280 --> 00:07:47,240
and Qin Kai?

185
00:07:48,080 --> 00:07:48,760
He is the gold medalist

186
00:07:48,760 --> 00:07:50,320
in the municipal competition.

187
00:07:50,320 --> 00:07:51,560
He represents the athlete student.

188
00:07:52,840 --> 00:07:53,880
Do you want me

189
00:07:53,880 --> 00:07:55,280
to interview all of them?

190
00:07:56,080 --> 00:07:57,320
Not all.

191
00:07:57,800 --> 00:07:59,400
Song Linxue and the others

192
00:07:59,400 --> 00:08:00,200
will be handled by me.

193
00:08:00,440 --> 00:08:01,680
As for the remaining two,

194
00:08:01,680 --> 00:08:03,160
(Ji Junxing, Qin Kai)
one is your good friend,

195
00:08:03,160 --> 00:08:04,640
(Ji Junxing, Qin Kai)
while the other one sits beside you.

196
00:08:04,640 --> 00:08:06,720
You have the best convenience
to interview them.

197
00:08:06,720 --> 00:08:07,840
You are the best choice.

198
00:08:08,720 --> 00:08:09,680
May I say no?

199
00:08:11,120 --> 00:08:12,400
Lin Xi.

200
00:08:13,600 --> 00:08:15,760
Can you bear to see me shouldering

201
00:08:15,760 --> 00:08:17,400
such a heavy task on my thin back

202
00:08:17,400 --> 00:08:18,680
without helping me?

203
00:08:18,960 --> 00:08:19,800
Can you bear to...

204
00:08:19,800 --> 00:08:20,560
Fine.

205
00:08:20,960 --> 00:08:21,840
I will do it.

206
00:08:22,600 --> 00:08:23,400
I know

207
00:08:23,400 --> 00:08:25,000
you will help me for sure.

208
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:27,880
When do you need this?

209
00:08:28,400 --> 00:08:29,000
Tonight.

210
00:08:29,480 --> 00:08:30,520
Seriously?

211
00:08:30,720 --> 00:08:32,080
If it wasn't this urgent,

212
00:08:32,080 --> 00:08:33,200
I wouldn't torture my best friend.

213
00:08:33,680 --> 00:08:34,920
Anyway, I have faith in you.

214
00:08:34,920 --> 00:08:36,880
With your smart brain

215
00:08:36,880 --> 00:08:38,160
you will definitely accomplish it.

216
00:08:38,160 --> 00:08:38,680
You can do this.

217
00:08:41,400 --> 00:08:42,680
Oh gosh, she indeed tortures me.

218
00:08:47,480 --> 00:08:48,280
Let's use this room.

219
00:08:50,800 --> 00:08:51,440
Sit anywhere you want.

220
00:08:58,720 --> 00:09:00,160
You can start now.

221
00:09:00,640 --> 00:09:01,880
We have to wait for a while.

222
00:09:03,960 --> 00:09:04,720
Who is coming?

223
00:09:05,240 --> 00:09:05,880
Qin...

224
00:09:06,560 --> 00:09:07,480
I'm sorry.

225
00:09:07,480 --> 00:09:08,840
I was having a training just now.

226
00:09:09,040 --> 00:09:09,720
I'm not late, am I?

227
00:09:09,960 --> 00:09:10,840
You got here just on time.

228
00:09:13,480 --> 00:09:14,840
Isn't this the star emcee

229
00:09:14,840 --> 00:09:16,040
in the gala night?

230
00:09:16,280 --> 00:09:17,160
You are here too.

231
00:09:19,800 --> 00:09:20,480
Why didn't you tell me

232
00:09:20,480 --> 00:09:21,440
someone is coming too?

233
00:09:22,200 --> 00:09:22,880
Please hear me out.

234
00:09:23,080 --> 00:09:24,520
I was given this task at short notice.

235
00:09:24,520 --> 00:09:26,200
Both of your interview outlines
are the same,

236
00:09:26,200 --> 00:09:27,600
so I call you two here

237
00:09:27,600 --> 00:09:28,920
due to time concerns.

238
00:09:29,680 --> 00:09:30,680
Help me, please.

239
00:09:30,680 --> 00:09:31,280
Thank you so much.

240
00:09:32,840 --> 00:09:33,240
Let's do it now.

241
00:09:35,040 --> 00:09:36,080
This is the outline of the interview.

242
00:09:36,080 --> 00:09:37,600
Let's start with the first question.

243
00:09:37,600 --> 00:09:38,200
What does Chunhui High School

244
00:09:38,200 --> 00:09:39,280
mean to you?

245
00:09:40,440 --> 00:09:41,400
Surprise and joy.

246
00:09:45,440 --> 00:09:46,280
Care to elaborate?

247
00:09:46,560 --> 00:09:47,680
For example,

248
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:49,560
the night when I first met you

249
00:09:50,080 --> 00:09:52,520
and we were running in the night

250
00:09:53,080 --> 00:09:54,200
to avoid security.

251
00:09:54,200 --> 00:09:56,240
It was a surprise and a joy for me.

252
00:09:59,520 --> 00:10:00,680
What about you?

253
00:10:04,400 --> 00:10:06,840
Chunhui is where we spend
our youth together

254
00:10:07,120 --> 00:10:09,920
and a place where our dreams begin.

255
00:10:13,720 --> 00:10:16,280
These words ring a bell.

256
00:10:16,560 --> 00:10:17,960
Lin Xi wrote this for me.

257
00:10:19,840 --> 00:10:20,680
The hosting script.

258
00:10:21,800 --> 00:10:23,240
Lin Xi wrote these lines

259
00:10:23,240 --> 00:10:26,240
for Chunhui's 75th anniversary.

260
00:10:29,640 --> 00:10:30,760
Next question.

261
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:32,920
Out of the school's motto,
freedom, perseverance and erudition,

262
00:10:32,920 --> 00:10:34,280
please define your understanding

263
00:10:34,280 --> 00:10:35,200
of freedom.

264
00:10:36,440 --> 00:10:37,120
Speaking of freedom,

265
00:10:37,480 --> 00:10:38,480
this is simple.

266
00:10:38,480 --> 00:10:39,600
Freedom means to be our real selves.

267
00:10:39,600 --> 00:10:41,600
Laugh when you are happy

268
00:10:41,600 --> 00:10:43,040
and cry when you are not.

269
00:10:43,040 --> 00:10:44,400
Not bound to any restriction.

270
00:10:45,240 --> 00:10:47,040
Be bold to confess

271
00:10:47,280 --> 00:10:49,440
when you admire someone.

272
00:10:53,360 --> 00:10:54,080
Freedom

273
00:10:54,080 --> 00:10:55,920
doesn't mean one can do anything
he wants without restriction.

274
00:10:56,200 --> 00:10:58,160
Instead, despite under conditions,

275
00:10:58,160 --> 00:10:59,560
one possesses liberal thoughts

276
00:10:59,760 --> 00:11:00,920
and a free spirit.

277
00:11:02,400 --> 00:11:03,320
Freedom that comes with restriction

278
00:11:03,320 --> 00:11:04,640
is like an eagle on a leash.

279
00:11:05,080 --> 00:11:07,040
Eagles should soar in the sky freely.

280
00:11:07,480 --> 00:11:08,920
Wings are not ornaments.

281
00:11:09,240 --> 00:11:10,400
Flying has to be their mission.

282
00:11:11,880 --> 00:11:12,920
Speaking of the sky,

283
00:11:12,920 --> 00:11:14,400
in a manner of fact,

284
00:11:14,400 --> 00:11:15,640
it should be the troposphere.

285
00:11:15,640 --> 00:11:16,760
No eagle can fly in the stratosphere.

286
00:11:17,240 --> 00:11:18,400
For one to soar freely,

287
00:11:18,400 --> 00:11:20,560
it should be within the limits set.

288
00:11:20,960 --> 00:11:23,480
Or else, one will turn wildly arrogant
and out of order.

289
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:26,000
You're coming after me.

290
00:11:26,600 --> 00:11:28,000
I just hope that you

291
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:29,640
could behave when you possess freedom

292
00:11:29,640 --> 00:11:31,160
but not to display some kind
of light show

293
00:11:31,160 --> 00:11:32,600
before the public.

294
00:11:32,840 --> 00:11:34,400
You made others feel awkward.

295
00:11:37,360 --> 00:11:38,400
Did I make you awkward?

296
00:11:39,600 --> 00:11:42,720
Not really.

297
00:11:45,720 --> 00:11:47,760
Didn't his behaviour bother you?

298
00:11:49,800 --> 00:11:52,800
Yes, a little bit.

299
00:11:56,080 --> 00:11:56,560
Wait.

300
00:11:57,080 --> 00:11:57,920
We are talking about freedom.

301
00:11:57,920 --> 00:11:59,000
How is this about me?

302
00:11:59,280 --> 00:11:59,800
Who's the one

303
00:11:59,800 --> 00:12:00,720
getting interviewed?

304
00:12:03,680 --> 00:12:05,600
This is not effective though.

305
00:12:05,600 --> 00:12:06,720
I will answer the questions myself.

306
00:12:08,720 --> 00:12:09,480
Good idea.

307
00:12:09,480 --> 00:12:10,760
Submit it to me by today.

308
00:12:13,880 --> 00:12:15,840
Do you want to answer the questions
by yourself?

309
00:12:16,240 --> 00:12:17,000
No.

310
00:12:17,240 --> 00:12:18,720
It's better if you interview me.

311
00:12:26,880 --> 00:12:27,880
During high school time,

312
00:12:27,880 --> 00:12:30,160
have you met a friend

313
00:12:30,640 --> 00:12:33,160
with whom you were honoured to know
and want to continue the friendship?

314
00:12:34,680 --> 00:12:35,920
Honoured to know? No, there is none.

315
00:12:36,560 --> 00:12:37,880
But one I feel ill-fated to meet.

316
00:12:49,920 --> 00:12:50,800
How is it?

317
00:12:51,200 --> 00:12:51,920
I'm done.

318
00:12:51,920 --> 00:12:52,560
Take it.

319
00:12:53,640 --> 00:12:54,320
Thank you.

320
00:12:54,600 --> 00:12:55,720
I go to bed now.

321
00:12:58,240 --> 00:12:59,600
It is only eight now.

322
00:13:05,800 --> 00:13:06,440
(A friend you wish to continue
your friendship with in high school)

323
00:13:06,440 --> 00:13:07,920
All students?

324
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:11,480
What a big heart he has.

325
00:13:20,360 --> 00:13:23,520
Mission completed.

326
00:13:39,900 --> 00:13:42,940
(Jiang Yimian)

327
00:13:44,480 --> 00:13:45,160
Hello.

328
00:13:45,880 --> 00:13:46,960
Hello, Lin Xi.

329
00:13:46,960 --> 00:13:47,840
You've done perfectly

330
00:13:47,840 --> 00:13:49,000
with their interviews.

331
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:50,360
Amazing.

332
00:13:50,360 --> 00:13:52,280
You're more resourceful
than the Monkey King

333
00:13:52,280 --> 00:13:54,560
and more compassionate than
the Goddess of Mercy.

334
00:13:54,560 --> 00:13:55,920
There are no challenges
too difficult for you.

335
00:13:55,920 --> 00:13:56,520
Stop it.

336
00:13:57,720 --> 00:13:59,000
Stop singing praises of me.

337
00:13:59,240 --> 00:14:00,360
When you start praising me,

338
00:14:00,360 --> 00:14:01,480
you must have something to ask of me.

339
00:14:01,880 --> 00:14:03,640
You are indeed smart.

340
00:14:03,640 --> 00:14:04,560
Good guess.

341
00:14:05,400 --> 00:14:06,960
What is it?

342
00:14:08,040 --> 00:14:08,920
My mum said

343
00:14:08,920 --> 00:14:10,760
I screwed my exam this time.

344
00:14:10,760 --> 00:14:11,720
She forced me to study at the library

345
00:14:11,720 --> 00:14:13,240
this weekend.

346
00:14:13,240 --> 00:14:14,600
And I can't do the photoshoot

347
00:14:14,600 --> 00:14:15,920
for both Ji Junxing and Song Linxue.

348
00:14:16,160 --> 00:14:18,440
Therefore, I would like to task you

349
00:14:18,440 --> 00:14:20,760
with this important job
at the last minute.

350
00:14:21,320 --> 00:14:22,960
How would I, a day worker

351
00:14:22,960 --> 00:14:25,440
be able to shoulder
such an important task?

352
00:14:26,400 --> 00:14:28,280
There is a new escape room
around the photo shooting venue.

353
00:14:28,320 --> 00:14:30,000
You can go there after the task.

354
00:14:30,080 --> 00:14:31,160
Are you sure to turn my request down?

355
00:14:32,280 --> 00:14:34,400
Fine, I will think about it.

356
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:36,280
I take that as a yes.

357
00:14:36,280 --> 00:14:37,440
Bye-bye, dear.

358
00:14:42,600 --> 00:14:43,480
She got me again.

359
00:14:54,960 --> 00:14:55,680
Good morning.

360
00:14:57,480 --> 00:14:58,360
Are you going out?

361
00:14:58,360 --> 00:14:59,040
Where to?

362
00:14:59,520 --> 00:15:01,000
Same as you. I'm going
to the bookstore too.

363
00:15:02,520 --> 00:15:03,200
You slept in early yesterday.

364
00:15:03,200 --> 00:15:04,160
I forgot to tell you

365
00:15:04,160 --> 00:15:05,240
that Jiang Yimian
has a sudden plan today.

366
00:15:05,520 --> 00:15:06,960
She asked me to do the photoshoot

367
00:15:07,240 --> 00:15:07,880
for you and Song Linxue.

368
00:15:08,520 --> 00:15:09,760
Oh, you wear two hats.

369
00:15:10,040 --> 00:15:11,720
Yeah, life is tough.

370
00:15:18,360 --> 00:15:20,720
Aperture, focal length,

371
00:15:20,720 --> 00:15:22,280
ios icon.

372
00:15:26,720 --> 00:15:27,360
Hey.

373
00:15:27,680 --> 00:15:29,040
Do you know where the shutter button is?

374
00:15:29,880 --> 00:15:31,440
I do have some knowledge about cameras.

375
00:15:31,440 --> 00:15:33,000
It is just that I'm not sure
about the parameters.

376
00:15:35,840 --> 00:15:37,400
Come, let me show you.

377
00:15:39,400 --> 00:15:40,480
Do you know about cameras?

378
00:15:42,760 --> 00:15:43,680
Look at this.

379
00:15:43,680 --> 00:15:45,920
This button adjusts
the size of the aperture.

380
00:15:46,160 --> 00:15:47,080
Large aperture size

381
00:15:47,240 --> 00:15:48,360
gives a shallow depth of field.

382
00:15:48,360 --> 00:15:49,800
It helps to focus the object

383
00:15:50,320 --> 00:15:52,240
and the background becomes blurry.

384
00:15:52,560 --> 00:15:54,200
The picture portrays as hazy

385
00:15:54,200 --> 00:15:55,440
and soft.

386
00:15:55,680 --> 00:15:57,080
This is suitable for portraits.

387
00:16:13,480 --> 00:16:15,280
How does the picture look?

388
00:16:17,880 --> 00:16:18,920
See it yourself.

389
00:16:32,240 --> 00:16:32,880
Right.

390
00:16:33,800 --> 00:16:34,640
Good.

391
00:16:35,480 --> 00:16:36,240
Excuse me.

392
00:16:36,600 --> 00:16:37,120
I think

393
00:16:37,120 --> 00:16:38,520
you can squat.

394
00:16:38,520 --> 00:16:39,680
My legs seem longer from that view.

395
00:16:40,480 --> 00:16:41,080
Got it.

396
00:16:45,080 --> 00:16:45,760
Lin Xi.

397
00:16:46,560 --> 00:16:47,960
You are a bit too low.

398
00:16:49,160 --> 00:16:50,680
Just bend your knees a little.

399
00:16:54,680 --> 00:16:55,320
No worries.

400
00:16:55,320 --> 00:16:56,680
I will get you the best picture.

401
00:16:59,000 --> 00:16:59,800
Nice.

402
00:17:00,760 --> 00:17:01,800
One more.

403
00:17:05,160 --> 00:17:07,200
Ji Junxing. Smile, please.

404
00:17:07,680 --> 00:17:08,640
Try to be friendly.

405
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:13,080
That's good.

406
00:17:14,240 --> 00:17:14,640
Maintain it.

407
00:17:14,640 --> 00:17:15,680
Maintain the smile.

408
00:17:19,960 --> 00:17:20,840
The light is good.

409
00:17:21,280 --> 00:17:21,840
Yes.

410
00:17:22,480 --> 00:17:23,040
Ji Junxing.

411
00:17:23,040 --> 00:17:24,400
Relax your body.

412
00:17:24,400 --> 00:17:26,000
Don't strain yourself.

413
00:17:26,280 --> 00:17:27,840
Perhaps you can lean against the wall.

414
00:17:29,360 --> 00:17:29,880
Like this?

415
00:17:30,640 --> 00:17:31,120
Your leg.

416
00:17:32,800 --> 00:17:33,720
My goodness.

417
00:17:35,440 --> 00:17:37,440
Stretch your right leg out.

418
00:17:37,440 --> 00:17:38,440
Bend your left leg a little.

419
00:17:39,120 --> 00:17:40,520
Relax your upper body.

420
00:17:41,840 --> 00:17:42,840
Right. Relax your body.

421
00:17:43,280 --> 00:17:44,760
Show your neck and strong jawline.

422
00:17:44,920 --> 00:17:46,280
Act like you enjoy the sun.

423
00:17:49,280 --> 00:17:50,360
Are you an old man?

424
00:17:50,360 --> 00:17:51,200
What's with your stiff neck?

425
00:17:51,200 --> 00:17:52,080
Look over there.

426
00:17:53,240 --> 00:17:54,000
Relax.

427
00:17:54,040 --> 00:17:54,960
Adjust your gaze.

428
00:17:55,120 --> 00:17:56,160
Look over there.

429
00:17:59,840 --> 00:18:00,560
Ji Junxing.

430
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:02,080
What's wrong with you?

431
00:18:06,280 --> 00:18:07,400
Hurry up.

432
00:18:07,720 --> 00:18:08,280
Got it?

433
00:18:08,840 --> 00:18:09,360
Yes, got it.

434
00:18:09,360 --> 00:18:10,520
Stay still.

435
00:18:10,520 --> 00:18:11,720
Stand there.

436
00:18:12,040 --> 00:18:13,280
Yes.

437
00:18:13,600 --> 00:18:14,480
Look over there, not me.

438
00:18:21,160 --> 00:18:21,680
Hello.

439
00:18:22,600 --> 00:18:23,080
What?

440
00:18:23,600 --> 00:18:24,800
Escape room?

441
00:18:24,960 --> 00:18:25,640
Today?

442
00:18:26,040 --> 00:18:26,800
Give me ten minutes.

443
00:18:29,720 --> 00:18:30,800
Did you rest?

444
00:18:31,920 --> 00:18:32,880
Yes, we are done.

445
00:18:33,440 --> 00:18:34,600
Come on. Get ready for high knees.

446
00:18:51,720 --> 00:18:52,720
Qin Kai. This is the finish line.

447
00:18:52,720 --> 00:18:54,360
My finish line is over there.

448
00:18:57,720 --> 00:18:59,040
Just four of you?

449
00:18:59,640 --> 00:19:00,520
Two teams?

450
00:19:01,200 --> 00:19:01,680
Yes.

451
00:19:01,680 --> 00:19:02,360
I prefer the package

452
00:19:02,360 --> 00:19:03,680
if we are split from the start

453
00:19:03,680 --> 00:19:04,560
of the game

454
00:19:04,560 --> 00:19:05,680
and meet up at the end.

455
00:19:07,440 --> 00:19:09,040
Why? Don't you have a package like this?

456
00:19:09,080 --> 00:19:10,520
Yes. Of course, we have.

457
00:19:11,400 --> 00:19:12,680
Here, take a look.

458
00:19:14,520 --> 00:19:16,960
Iris.

459
00:19:17,360 --> 00:19:18,760
This name sounds elegant.

460
00:19:19,200 --> 00:19:19,720
What do you think?

461
00:19:20,240 --> 00:19:21,280
Yes.

462
00:19:21,760 --> 00:19:22,480
Let's go.

463
00:19:22,480 --> 00:19:23,360
This way.

464
00:19:26,560 --> 00:19:27,400
This way.

465
00:19:27,880 --> 00:19:28,560
Sir.

466
00:19:28,560 --> 00:19:30,040
Is this game suitable for weak hearts?

467
00:19:30,040 --> 00:19:30,840
For two of them.

468
00:19:31,680 --> 00:19:32,680
They can't play horror themes?

469
00:19:32,680 --> 00:19:33,680
Leave the horror theme to us.

470
00:19:34,680 --> 00:19:35,200
Got it.

471
00:19:35,640 --> 00:19:37,000
They play the theme that needs thinking.

472
00:19:37,200 --> 00:19:38,200
All right. Come with me.

473
00:19:40,760 --> 00:19:41,760
I can't see anything.

474
00:19:41,760 --> 00:19:42,720
I'm not shivering. I'm not afraid.

475
00:19:42,720 --> 00:19:43,920
How much further do we have to walk?

476
00:19:46,360 --> 00:19:47,280
How much longer?

477
00:19:48,360 --> 00:19:49,040
Who is it?

478
00:19:49,040 --> 00:19:49,880
Someone holds on to me.

479
00:19:49,880 --> 00:19:51,920
(The most popular escape them.)

480
00:19:51,920 --> 00:19:54,040
(Aside from testing your intelligence
and collaboration,)

481
00:19:54,120 --> 00:19:56,080
(trust and luck are crucial too.)

482
00:19:56,440 --> 00:19:58,400
(Only a few accomplished the challenges.)

483
00:19:58,640 --> 00:20:00,600
(There will be two routes.
Please enjoy the game.)

484
00:20:00,600 --> 00:20:02,240
(There is a surprise awaiting you.)

485
00:20:12,600 --> 00:20:14,880
(Take off the blindfold now.)

486
00:20:20,560 --> 00:20:21,240
You are here.

487
00:20:21,240 --> 00:20:21,920
(Driver.)

488
00:20:21,960 --> 00:20:23,240
(You have three minutes)

489
00:20:23,240 --> 00:20:24,720
(to look for the raincoats in the van)

490
00:20:24,720 --> 00:20:26,080
(and take the passenger to leave)

491
00:20:26,080 --> 00:20:27,480
(for the next level.)

492
00:20:27,480 --> 00:20:29,520
(Otherwise, you will be swallowed
by darkness.)

493
00:20:30,560 --> 00:20:32,680
When can we remove the blindfold?

494
00:20:34,520 --> 00:20:35,200
I'm afraid.

495
00:20:35,200 --> 00:20:35,880
Don't be afraid.

496
00:20:35,880 --> 00:20:36,360
I'm here.

497
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:39,200
(Take off the blindfold now.)

498
00:20:48,520 --> 00:20:49,080
Hello.

499
00:20:49,800 --> 00:20:51,560
(Welcome to my resource room.)

500
00:20:52,040 --> 00:20:52,920
(This place keeps)

501
00:20:52,920 --> 00:20:54,280
(the information of four people.)

502
00:20:54,800 --> 00:20:55,760
(Please find them out)

503
00:20:55,760 --> 00:20:57,080
(Beiyang Times)
(and put their name cards in order.)

504
00:20:57,280 --> 00:20:58,360
(Zhang Yueru, You Lian)
(And you will get the clue)

505
00:20:58,360 --> 00:21:00,160
(Castle Peak Hospital)
(to open the safe behind you.)

506
00:21:00,360 --> 00:21:02,120
(You can enter the next level)

507
00:21:02,120 --> 00:21:03,200
(only by accomplishing their last wishes.)

508
00:21:18,840 --> 00:21:19,760
The numbers of car light flashing

509
00:21:19,760 --> 00:21:20,920
corresponds to the passcode.

510
00:21:20,920 --> 00:21:22,080
You are smart.

511
00:21:26,040 --> 00:21:26,560
Six.

512
00:21:29,400 --> 00:21:30,000
One.

513
00:21:32,680 --> 00:21:33,360
Two.

514
00:21:35,160 --> 00:21:36,000
Three.

515
00:21:36,600 --> 00:21:40,720
Six, one, two, three.

516
00:21:41,520 --> 00:21:43,120
Qin Kai, we got the raincoats.

517
00:21:45,840 --> 00:21:46,800
You are awesome.

518
00:21:53,800 --> 00:21:55,040
These are the documents
of the four people.

519
00:21:56,320 --> 00:21:57,720
Participants, please

520
00:21:57,720 --> 00:22:00,360
put the name cards in the correct order.

521
00:22:01,400 --> 00:22:02,920
I think we should put it here.

522
00:22:03,440 --> 00:22:05,240
What is the sequence of the name cards?

523
00:22:09,160 --> 00:22:09,760
Could it be

524
00:22:09,760 --> 00:22:11,360
the year when they got admitted?

525
00:22:11,560 --> 00:22:12,360
Give it a try.

526
00:22:12,640 --> 00:22:13,120
Let's try it.

527
00:22:13,760 --> 00:22:15,160
The first person is

528
00:22:15,880 --> 00:22:16,760
Xu Guoqiang.

529
00:22:17,400 --> 00:22:18,440
Then, Zhou Lihua.

530
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:19,520
Jie Lu.

531
00:22:19,520 --> 00:22:21,120
The fourth one is Yue Bing.

532
00:22:23,760 --> 00:22:24,720
This one.

533
00:22:27,040 --> 00:22:28,160
It is a tape.

534
00:22:28,160 --> 00:22:29,160
A tape.

535
00:22:29,640 --> 00:22:31,000
Let's find if there is a tape player.

536
00:22:40,480 --> 00:22:41,520
Something is in this box.

537
00:22:44,280 --> 00:22:45,280
There is really a tape player.

538
00:22:48,560 --> 00:22:50,720
This is kind of boring.

539
00:22:50,760 --> 00:22:52,000
Why don't we...

540
00:22:55,480 --> 00:22:57,280
(This is so fun.)

541
00:22:58,560 --> 00:22:59,880
(The character is cool.)

542
00:23:00,240 --> 00:23:01,800
(Mister, don't run.)

543
00:23:05,120 --> 00:23:07,080
They seem to be enjoying this game
very much.

544
00:23:07,520 --> 00:23:08,800
Forget about them.

545
00:23:12,200 --> 00:23:12,800
Zero.

546
00:23:13,600 --> 00:23:14,080
Five.

547
00:23:14,920 --> 00:23:15,600
One.

548
00:23:16,880 --> 00:23:18,320
Zero, five, one, one.

549
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:24,920
The passcode is zero five one one.

550
00:23:24,920 --> 00:23:27,560
(Congratulations.
The passcode is correct.)

551
00:23:27,560 --> 00:23:28,460
(Castle Peak Hospital)

552
00:23:33,840 --> 00:23:35,520
Go to the chemistry laboratory

553
00:23:35,520 --> 00:23:36,760
and find the passcode to the next level.

554
00:23:37,040 --> 00:23:38,000
The game

555
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:39,040
is challenging our intelligence.

556
00:23:39,040 --> 00:23:39,920
Here comes another riddle.

557
00:23:39,920 --> 00:23:40,360
Let's go

558
00:23:40,360 --> 00:23:41,880
to the chemistry lab.

559
00:23:41,920 --> 00:23:42,520
Yes.

560
00:23:51,080 --> 00:23:52,280
It is a dead end.

561
00:24:03,840 --> 00:24:05,160
There is a button behind you.

562
00:24:08,840 --> 00:24:09,840
Why are you here?

563
00:24:09,840 --> 00:24:11,240
Why did the door bring you here?

564
00:24:14,520 --> 00:24:15,520
Ji Junxing.

565
00:24:16,080 --> 00:24:18,040
Press the red button.

566
00:24:19,320 --> 00:24:20,680
I did. Nothing happens.

567
00:24:20,680 --> 00:24:22,000
Press it again.

568
00:24:22,320 --> 00:24:23,280
It doesn't work.

569
00:24:24,480 --> 00:24:25,160
I can't go back.

570
00:24:25,160 --> 00:24:26,160
So do you.

571
00:24:26,160 --> 00:24:27,240
Stupid door.

572
00:24:30,800 --> 00:24:31,640
What do we do now?

573
00:24:31,640 --> 00:24:32,440
Do you want to continue?

574
00:24:32,520 --> 00:24:33,520
No, let's leave.

575
00:24:33,520 --> 00:24:34,560
Don't go.

576
00:24:34,560 --> 00:24:35,520
Try the passcode.

577
00:24:35,520 --> 00:24:35,960
Don't give up.

578
00:24:35,960 --> 00:24:36,480
Quit pressing it.

579
00:24:36,480 --> 00:24:37,520
Let's try again.

580
00:24:42,920 --> 00:24:43,800
Don't leave.

581
00:24:43,800 --> 00:24:44,920
Let's try again.

582
00:24:44,920 --> 00:24:46,000
Quit pressing the button.

583
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:47,040
It won't do any difference.

584
00:24:47,040 --> 00:24:48,880
Probably this is the surprise mentioned
just now.

585
00:24:48,880 --> 00:24:49,480
What the heck?

586
00:24:49,480 --> 00:24:50,360
I thought we could play the game

587
00:24:50,360 --> 00:24:51,360
separately.

588
00:24:52,040 --> 00:24:52,960
The boss lied.

589
00:24:52,960 --> 00:24:53,720
Boss.

590
00:24:55,520 --> 00:24:56,480
We want to quit.

591
00:24:56,800 --> 00:24:58,720
We quit.

592
00:25:05,160 --> 00:25:05,680
Boss.

593
00:25:05,680 --> 00:25:06,560
I'm sorry

594
00:25:06,560 --> 00:25:08,240
for disturbing you and Qin Kai.

595
00:25:09,400 --> 00:25:10,920
You were indeed having fun just now.

596
00:25:11,040 --> 00:25:12,040
This is so fun.

597
00:25:14,600 --> 00:25:15,720
I'm so happy.

598
00:25:15,720 --> 00:25:16,720
Why did it sound weird

599
00:25:16,720 --> 00:25:17,800
when you said that out?

600
00:25:18,160 --> 00:25:19,440
Because I'm imitating your tone.

601
00:25:20,120 --> 00:25:21,160
If you think I'm loud,

602
00:25:21,160 --> 00:25:22,440
go back now.

603
00:25:22,960 --> 00:25:23,960
I can't.

604
00:25:24,240 --> 00:25:25,120
Come with me.

605
00:25:25,840 --> 00:25:27,120
I don't want to. Why should I?

606
00:25:28,880 --> 00:25:30,320
Don't drag me.

607
00:25:30,320 --> 00:25:32,040
I'm not playing. I want to go out.

608
00:25:32,040 --> 00:25:33,560
Don't force me.

609
00:25:34,120 --> 00:25:34,680
Here.

610
00:25:35,240 --> 00:25:36,040
Boss.

611
00:25:36,040 --> 00:25:36,920
Boss, I quit.

612
00:25:36,920 --> 00:25:37,920
Boss, I give up.

613
00:25:37,920 --> 00:25:38,480
Hey, boss.

614
00:25:38,480 --> 00:25:40,280
Didn't you pester me
even though I ignored you

615
00:25:40,280 --> 00:25:41,720
when you wanted to befriend me?

616
00:25:42,040 --> 00:25:42,640
How come

617
00:25:42,640 --> 00:25:44,080
you want to step down now?

618
00:25:45,560 --> 00:25:47,360
Are you afraid your shallow
intelligence will be exposed?

619
00:25:50,960 --> 00:25:52,400
I don't think this game
can be difficult though.

620
00:25:52,720 --> 00:25:53,480
Good for you.

621
00:25:53,480 --> 00:25:54,680
The reverse psychology works.

622
00:25:54,960 --> 00:25:56,320
Today, I will continue the game

623
00:25:56,320 --> 00:25:57,440
till I pass.

624
00:26:01,280 --> 00:26:02,160
I would love to.

625
00:26:17,440 --> 00:26:18,120
Well.

626
00:26:18,560 --> 00:26:19,800
According to my understanding of them,

627
00:26:20,160 --> 00:26:21,240
there will be something showing up
from the window

628
00:26:21,240 --> 00:26:22,520
to scare us out later.

629
00:26:22,760 --> 00:26:23,960
You can hide behind me.

630
00:26:24,320 --> 00:26:25,400
Don't be shy.

631
00:26:25,600 --> 00:26:26,560
Your health matters more.

632
00:26:27,880 --> 00:26:29,200
Hurry up and find the clue.

633
00:26:43,960 --> 00:26:44,840
There is a chest.

634
00:26:57,200 --> 00:26:58,960
It seems we have to open it together.

635
00:26:59,440 --> 00:27:00,160
Unlock it.

636
00:27:00,160 --> 00:27:01,600
We are nearing the victory

637
00:27:01,600 --> 00:27:02,680
and I'm free then.

638
00:27:06,880 --> 00:27:08,440
One eight two seven.

639
00:27:09,680 --> 00:27:11,240
The passcode can't be this easy.

640
00:27:11,920 --> 00:27:13,720
(The passcode for this level
is five words.)

641
00:27:14,280 --> 00:27:15,120
(It is something common)

642
00:27:15,120 --> 00:27:17,640
(in the kong fu novel.)

643
00:27:21,280 --> 00:27:22,920
She said the passcode is five words.

644
00:27:23,360 --> 00:27:25,000
These numbers aren't the passcode.

645
00:27:27,640 --> 00:27:29,400
There are many chemical solutions here.

646
00:27:29,760 --> 00:27:30,920
If I'm not wrong,

647
00:27:30,920 --> 00:27:31,720
one eight two seven

648
00:27:31,720 --> 00:27:33,040
is the sequence
in the periodic table.

649
00:27:33,160 --> 00:27:34,240
I thought so.

650
00:27:34,240 --> 00:27:35,840
Based on the periodic table,

651
00:27:36,280 --> 00:27:37,280
oxygen is the eighth

652
00:27:37,280 --> 00:27:38,360
and nitrogen is the seventh.

653
00:27:38,760 --> 00:27:40,480
Therefore, one eight two seven should be

654
00:27:40,920 --> 00:27:41,960
nitrous oxide.
[*Note:1 oxygen atom and 2 nitrogen atoms]

655
00:27:43,840 --> 00:27:45,480
But it is strange for nitrous oxide

656
00:27:45,480 --> 00:27:47,200
to be found in the kong fu novel though.

657
00:27:48,960 --> 00:27:49,760
Nitrous oxide

658
00:27:49,760 --> 00:27:50,880
is found in the laughing gas.

659
00:27:51,800 --> 00:27:52,880
Laughing gas.

660
00:27:53,760 --> 00:27:54,600
Laugh in half step epilepsy.

661
00:27:54,600 --> 00:27:55,200
Exactly.

662
00:27:56,960 --> 00:27:58,520
The answer is
'laugh in half step epilepsy'.

663
00:28:02,240 --> 00:28:03,120
Don't look.

664
00:28:04,680 --> 00:28:05,480
Is the answer wrong?

665
00:28:05,480 --> 00:28:06,440
It shouldn't be.

666
00:28:06,440 --> 00:28:07,520
Nitrous oxide.

667
00:28:07,520 --> 00:28:08,680
Ten spices of nerve numbness.

668
00:28:08,960 --> 00:28:09,840
Stop guessing.

669
00:28:10,280 --> 00:28:12,000
Do you still remember
what the boss said?

670
00:28:12,480 --> 00:28:13,800
Aside from intelligence
and collaboration,

671
00:28:13,880 --> 00:28:15,120
trust and luck are crucial too.

672
00:28:15,120 --> 00:28:15,520
Right.

673
00:28:15,520 --> 00:28:16,360
He must be

674
00:28:16,360 --> 00:28:17,400
hinting at us.

675
00:28:17,680 --> 00:28:18,360
Besides,

676
00:28:18,360 --> 00:28:20,120
Iris brings the meaning
of love and trust.

677
00:28:20,120 --> 00:28:21,280
What if the boss

678
00:28:21,280 --> 00:28:21,800
is testing our trust in each other

679
00:28:21,800 --> 00:28:23,200
at the final level?

680
00:28:23,440 --> 00:28:24,320
What do you mean?

681
00:28:24,400 --> 00:28:25,720
We came up with this answer together.

682
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:27,200
I don't think it is wrong.

683
00:28:27,440 --> 00:28:28,680
What if it is wrong?

684
00:28:29,080 --> 00:28:30,520
At least I'm here with you.

685
00:28:37,440 --> 00:28:38,080
We don't change the answer.

686
00:28:39,080 --> 00:28:40,200
- Laugh in half step epilepsy.
- Laugh in half step epilepsy.
