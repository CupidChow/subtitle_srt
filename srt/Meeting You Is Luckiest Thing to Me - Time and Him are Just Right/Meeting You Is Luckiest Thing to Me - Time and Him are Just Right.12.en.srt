(The municipal education bureau holds)

18
00:01:41,509 --> 00:01:42,589
(an English composition contest.)

19
00:01:42,589 --> 00:01:44,109
(The theme is the meaning of idols)

20
00:01:44,109 --> 00:01:44,989
(and there's no range of the content
of your writing.)

21
00:01:44,989 --> 00:01:46,069
(Your participation is compulsory.)

22
00:01:46,069 --> 00:01:47,309
(Hope that all students
can take it seriously.)

23
00:01:47,309 --> 00:01:49,389
According to Chinese-English Dictionary,
'idol' is defined

24
00:01:49,389 --> 00:01:51,509
as someone who is greatly admired
and loved.

25
00:01:52,709 --> 00:01:53,469
What do you think?

26
00:01:53,669 --> 00:01:54,949
How do you define 'idol'?

27
00:01:55,909 --> 00:01:56,869
In my opinion,

28
00:01:57,629 --> 00:01:59,029
an idol is someone like Hawking.

29
00:01:59,349 --> 00:02:00,949
Though his body was confined
in the wheelchair,

30
00:02:01,469 --> 00:02:03,149
his mind soared freely
in the sky.

31
00:02:03,829 --> 00:02:04,629
He was the spiritual leader

32
00:02:04,629 --> 00:02:06,269
who led humans to explore the unknown.

33
00:02:06,549 --> 00:02:07,629
Why make it so complicated?

34
00:02:08,109 --> 00:02:08,829
I think an idol

35
00:02:08,829 --> 00:02:10,549
is a projection of one's ideal.

36
00:02:10,829 --> 00:02:12,269
For example, I like playing basketball.

37
00:02:12,549 --> 00:02:13,629
So, my idol is Kobe.

38
00:02:13,629 --> 00:02:14,549
He's the ideal basketball player

39
00:02:14,549 --> 00:02:15,549
to me.

40
00:02:15,549 --> 00:02:16,429
I agree with you.

41
00:02:16,749 --> 00:02:18,029
My idol is Jobs.

42
00:02:18,029 --> 00:02:19,029
I want to build a great career

43
00:02:19,029 --> 00:02:20,629
like he did.

44
00:02:23,189 --> 00:02:24,349
To me,

45
00:02:24,349 --> 00:02:26,589
my idol exists in the form
of the Mirror principle.

46
00:02:26,869 --> 00:02:28,149
When I see my favorite band

47
00:02:28,149 --> 00:02:29,509
devote themselves to making good music

48
00:02:29,669 --> 00:02:30,669
and pursuing their dreams courageously,

49
00:02:31,149 --> 00:02:33,149
they spur me to strive harder

50
00:02:33,149 --> 00:02:34,829
and be as good as them.

51
00:02:35,029 --> 00:02:36,189
That's what idols are for.

52
00:02:38,069 --> 00:02:39,149
Well said.

53
00:02:39,669 --> 00:02:41,429
You do have genuine feelings for idols.

54
00:02:41,949 --> 00:02:42,509
Anyway,

55
00:02:42,669 --> 00:02:43,669
'idol'

56
00:02:43,789 --> 00:02:45,149
is a bespoke theme for me.

57
00:02:45,309 --> 00:02:46,389
I'm thrilled and my idea
keeps popping out

58
00:02:46,389 --> 00:02:47,869
like the surging river.

59
00:02:47,869 --> 00:02:48,709
I can compose

60
00:02:48,709 --> 00:02:50,349
a long thesis in English.

61
00:02:50,469 --> 00:02:51,229
I'm going to write now.

62
00:02:55,669 --> 00:02:56,829
Gosh, she's writing now.

63
00:03:03,560 --> 00:03:06,620
(Straight to the top
and outshine the world)

64
00:03:19,429 --> 00:03:20,869
Naruto and Gaara

65
00:03:21,549 --> 00:03:22,589
are the perfect match.

66
00:03:25,629 --> 00:03:26,549
Do you still remember we came here

67
00:03:26,549 --> 00:03:28,189
searching for information about idols?

68
00:03:28,789 --> 00:03:30,029
Naruto is my idol.

71

Now, who is judging?

72
00:03:37,909 --> 00:03:39,149
I'm not distracted by something else.

73
00:03:39,429 --> 00:03:41,269
I'm finding the aspiration for my idol.

Turing Award

81
00:03:57,589 --> 00:03:58,709
at the age of thirty-six.

He still holds the record
of the youngest award winner.

83
00:04:04,589 --> 00:04:05,789
Well, to me,

84
00:04:05,789 --> 00:04:06,789
programming

85
00:04:07,389 --> 00:04:09,989
is kind of boring.

86
00:04:10,989 --> 00:04:12,269
Boring?

87
00:04:12,829 --> 00:04:14,029
One is trapped before the computer

88
00:04:14,029 --> 00:04:15,669
and hitting twenty-six alphabet keys
on the keyboard

89
00:04:15,669 --> 00:04:16,469
every day.

90
00:04:16,829 --> 00:04:18,909
Don't you find the activity repetitive
and dull?

91
00:04:18,909 --> 00:04:19,629
Who tells you

92
00:04:19,629 --> 00:04:21,269
programming is merely about
hitting the typing keys?

93
00:04:21,589 --> 00:04:22,509
It is a new method

94
00:04:22,509 --> 00:04:23,909

95

if humans can

97

via programming.

98

Money?

100
00:04:34,069 --> 00:04:35,789
Programming is not about earning money.

101
00:04:39,149 --> 00:04:40,429
Fortune is falling all over.

102
00:04:40,429 --> 00:04:41,469
Take it.

103
00:04:42,709 --> 00:04:43,469
What is going on?

104
00:04:44,909 --> 00:04:46,149
It is ten yuan.

105
00:04:47,389 --> 00:04:48,429
Where are these from?

106
00:04:48,629 --> 00:04:50,269

They all fly away.

Bye-bye.

116
00:05:06,869 --> 00:05:07,829
465 yuan.

117
00:05:07,829 --> 00:05:08,509
Did I count it wrong?

118
00:05:08,509 --> 00:05:09,189
I count it again.

119
00:05:09,189 --> 00:05:10,389
It is already the third time.

120
00:05:10,389 --> 00:05:11,829
I bet there must be
someone keeping the money.

121
00:05:12,029 --> 00:05:12,949
I never expected students of Chunhui

122
00:05:12,949 --> 00:05:14,189
would take advantage of others,

123
00:05:14,189 --> 00:05:14,789
be immoral

124
00:05:14,789 --> 00:05:15,869
and be greedy for others' money.

125
00:05:17,669 --> 00:05:18,589
Are you looking for your money?

126
00:05:20,349 --> 00:05:21,189
I have it with me.

127
00:05:21,869 --> 00:05:22,829
I told you.

128
00:05:22,829 --> 00:05:24,509
Our Chunhui isn't that hopeless.

129
00:05:25,069 --> 00:05:26,269
480 yuan. The figure is correct.

130
00:05:26,949 --> 00:05:27,789
I thought

131
00:05:27,789 --> 00:05:29,709
you were giving back to the community

132
00:05:29,709 --> 00:05:30,949
after earning a fortune
from the business.

133
00:05:31,189 --> 00:05:32,949
Why did you spread your wealth

134
00:05:32,949 --> 00:05:34,189
from the high level?

135
00:05:34,189 --> 00:05:35,149
We didn't mean to.

136
00:05:35,149 --> 00:05:36,109
It is Xie Ang's fault.

137
00:05:36,269 --> 00:05:37,989
He said we shouldn't expose the money.

138
00:05:37,989 --> 00:05:39,909
We have to find somewhere private
to count the money.

139
00:05:40,229 --> 00:05:41,029
Look at what has happened.

140
00:05:41,189 --> 00:05:42,349
Everyone knows about it now.

141
00:05:42,669 --> 00:05:44,669
We were counting the money
for the concert ticket.

142
00:05:44,669 --> 00:05:45,749
We must get a romantic place

143
00:05:45,989 --> 00:05:47,429
for such an important ritual.

144
00:05:47,709 --> 00:05:48,429
Hold on.

145
00:05:48,629 --> 00:05:49,949
Did you gather enough money
for the ticket?

146
00:05:50,229 --> 00:05:51,069
More than enough.

147
00:05:51,069 --> 00:05:52,109
The money issue is settled now.

148
00:05:52,389 --> 00:05:53,149
But,

149
00:05:53,389 --> 00:05:54,509
there is only one missing piece

150
00:05:54,989 --> 00:05:56,669
of the puzzle and that is you.

(Computer Room 122)

152
00:06:05,869 --> 00:06:07,869
Isn't grabbing tickets easy?

153
00:06:07,869 --> 00:06:09,309
Why do you need Ji Junxing here?

154
00:06:09,709 --> 00:06:10,469
You may not know

155
00:06:10,469 --> 00:06:12,069
grabbing a ticket for
the music festival is challenging.

156
00:06:12,069 --> 00:06:13,029
All tickets are sold out

157
00:06:13,029 --> 00:06:14,309
in a flash.

158
00:06:14,469 --> 00:06:15,949
I must get help
from a programming expert

159
00:06:15,949 --> 00:06:17,349
who has dexterous fingers.

160
00:06:17,349 --> 00:06:18,109
And he

161
00:06:18,389 --> 00:06:19,549
is the expert I said.

162
00:06:21,109 --> 00:06:21,949
Him?

163
00:06:23,029 --> 00:06:24,069
Xing is the ace member
of the programming team

164
00:06:24,069 --> 00:06:25,389
during junior high

165
00:06:25,389 --> 00:06:26,829
for his speedy programming.

166
00:06:26,829 --> 00:06:28,029
If it wasn't for him to leave the club

167
00:06:28,029 --> 00:06:28,829
during Grade 3's summer break,

168
00:06:28,829 --> 00:06:30,029
he would've been listed
in the national team.

169
00:06:30,429 --> 00:06:31,149
I thought

170
00:06:31,149 --> 00:06:32,549
you just took it as a hobby.

171
00:06:32,789 --> 00:06:33,949
I didn't know you were that amazing.

172
00:06:35,349 --> 00:06:36,789
It has been a long time

173
00:06:36,789 --> 00:06:37,909
and I'm a little out of practice.

174
00:06:44,829 --> 00:06:45,829
Ten seconds from now.

175
00:06:45,989 --> 00:06:46,909
Get ready.

176
00:06:47,829 --> 00:06:50,229
Three, two, one.

177
00:06:50,229 --> 00:06:51,029
Start.

178
00:06:52,160 --> 00:06:52,560
(Time Band and Rock Ocean Music Festival
in Yuezhou)

179
00:06:52,560 --> 00:06:53,349
(Time Band and Rock Ocean Music Festival in Yuezhou)
How come the page is not responding?

180
00:06:53,709 --> 00:06:54,629
Fill in the personal information.

181
00:07:02,400 --> 00:07:03,740
(Ticket is bought)

182
00:07:04,469 --> 00:07:05,429
I got it.

183
00:07:06,509 --> 00:07:07,189
You got it?

184
00:07:07,189 --> 00:07:08,189
You are fast.

185
00:07:08,189 --> 00:07:10,229
Ji Junxing, you are awesome.

186
00:07:10,229 --> 00:07:11,389
My goodness.

187
00:07:11,389 --> 00:07:13,269
Is this the legendary golden fingers?

188
00:07:13,269 --> 00:07:14,789
I must worship your fingers.

189
00:07:14,789 --> 00:07:16,309
Enough. Don't be exaggerating.

190
00:07:17,389 --> 00:07:19,109
I'm impressed by your ability

191
00:07:19,509 --> 00:07:21,509
after witnessing this.

192
00:07:22,189 --> 00:07:23,469
This is just basic.

193
00:07:23,789 --> 00:07:24,469
If there is time,

194
00:07:24,469 --> 00:07:26,429
I will show you the real programming.

195
00:07:28,789 --> 00:07:29,989
I have got enough money

196
00:07:30,429 --> 00:07:31,509
as well as the ticket.

197
00:07:31,789 --> 00:07:32,389
Get out of my way.

198
00:07:32,389 --> 00:07:34,269
This is genuine bliss in life.

199
00:07:34,469 --> 00:07:35,269
Little Xi.

200
00:07:35,709 --> 00:07:37,909
My mum is taking me to a gathering
this weekend.

201
00:07:38,989 --> 00:07:40,109
Can you do me a favor?

202
00:07:40,869 --> 00:07:41,869
What again?

203
00:07:45,429 --> 00:07:46,909
What is our mission today?

204
00:07:47,869 --> 00:07:49,469
This is the shopping list
of Jiang Yimian.

205
00:07:50,829 --> 00:07:52,469
Music Basic Theory,

206
00:07:52,469 --> 00:07:53,389
Fundamental of Music Theory,

207
00:07:53,389 --> 00:07:55,349
History of China's Ancient Music,

208
00:07:55,349 --> 00:07:57,549
Jean-Christophe,

209
00:07:57,789 --> 00:07:59,669
and Music in Western Civilization.

210
00:07:59,869 --> 00:08:00,709
Are these necessary

211
00:08:00,709 --> 00:08:01,909
just for a music festival?

212
00:08:02,189 --> 00:08:03,309
I doubt it too.

213
00:08:03,469 --> 00:08:04,029
But she said

214
00:08:04,029 --> 00:08:05,509
she wanted to be equipped
with a highly music-educated mind

215
00:08:05,509 --> 00:08:07,029
to go to her favorite concert

216
00:08:07,029 --> 00:08:08,749
for a soul-interacting with music.

217
00:08:09,829 --> 00:08:11,269
Fine. Get on.

218
00:08:13,429 --> 00:08:13,949
Let's go.

219
00:08:14,149 --> 00:08:15,029
Hold on to me tightly.

220
00:08:21,309 --> 00:08:23,269
I can't believe Yimian actually

221
00:08:23,349 --> 00:08:24,349
learns music theories
from all around the world

222
00:08:24,349 --> 00:08:26,269
for the sake of a music festival.

223
00:08:26,829 --> 00:08:28,029
I'm really impressed.

224
00:08:29,269 --> 00:08:30,869
Probably this is the power
of the role model.

225
00:08:31,709 --> 00:08:32,429
I remember

226
00:08:32,429 --> 00:08:34,109
I was as fanatic as her

227
00:08:34,269 --> 00:08:35,149
when I first interacted

228
00:08:35,509 --> 00:08:36,149
with programming.

229
00:08:36,549 --> 00:08:37,349
I was apt

230
00:08:37,349 --> 00:08:39,109
to finish all programming knowledge
in one day.

231
00:08:40,069 --> 00:08:42,069
It seems you like programming very much.

232
00:08:42,069 --> 00:08:43,829
Why did you give it up?

233
00:08:46,949 --> 00:08:47,829
It is a long story.

234
00:08:48,469 --> 00:08:49,429
I will tell you later.

235
00:08:50,749 --> 00:08:51,869
Mysterious.

236
00:08:56,509 --> 00:08:57,829
Come and look for the books.

237
00:08:58,269 --> 00:08:59,749
Let's grab a meal after this.

238
00:09:01,709 --> 00:09:02,589
I'm hungry.

239
00:09:07,909 --> 00:09:08,829
Where is the book?

240
00:09:14,629 --> 00:09:15,789
Welcome.

241
00:09:16,869 --> 00:09:17,509
Hello.

242
00:09:17,509 --> 00:09:20,309
I want a combo set meal.

243
00:09:20,309 --> 00:09:21,309
Sure, coming right up.

244
00:09:22,189 --> 00:09:22,749
That's a lot.

245
00:09:22,749 --> 00:09:23,669
Can you finish all?

246
00:09:23,949 --> 00:09:25,189
I'm quite confident

247
00:09:25,189 --> 00:09:26,429
about your huge appetite.

248
00:09:27,069 --> 00:09:28,149
I will let you down.

249
00:09:28,149 --> 00:09:29,109
I'm too hungry now

250
00:09:29,109 --> 00:09:31,229
and I have lost my appetite.

251
00:09:32,949 --> 00:09:34,909
Mister, this is the combo seat meal.

252
00:09:35,149 --> 00:09:35,829
Thank you.

253
00:09:35,829 --> 00:09:36,229
By the way,

254
00:09:36,229 --> 00:09:38,149
we have a special promotion today.

255
00:09:38,149 --> 00:09:38,909
If you spend up to fifty yuan,

256
00:09:38,909 --> 00:09:40,949
you can get a mysterious toy box.

257
00:09:42,549 --> 00:09:43,269
A mysterious box?

258
00:09:43,269 --> 00:09:43,949
It is over here.

259
00:09:47,309 --> 00:09:48,709
This is adorable.

260
00:09:48,909 --> 00:09:50,069
Can I have this?

261
00:09:50,909 --> 00:09:51,869
I'm sorry,

262
00:09:51,869 --> 00:09:53,189
but we have to act according
to the rules.

263
00:09:53,389 --> 00:09:54,229
The probability isn't low

264
00:09:54,229 --> 00:09:55,509
to get this toy

265
00:09:55,509 --> 00:09:56,429
from the mysterious box.

266
00:10:22,189 --> 00:10:23,429
I got it.

267
00:10:23,669 --> 00:10:24,629
It's the bunny and the fox.

268
00:10:25,669 --> 00:10:26,829
This is so cute.

269
00:10:31,029 --> 00:10:31,869
Do you like it?

270
00:10:31,869 --> 00:10:32,349
You can have it.

271
00:10:33,749 --> 00:10:35,029
If I'm not wrong,

272
00:10:35,029 --> 00:10:36,829
I paid for the four set meals.

273
00:10:37,869 --> 00:10:38,429
You can't

274
00:10:38,429 --> 00:10:39,869
waste all the food.

275
00:10:40,309 --> 00:10:41,309
Pack them up and take them home.

276
00:10:42,309 --> 00:10:43,389
I was talking about the toy.

277
00:10:44,349 --> 00:10:45,149
Forget it if you don't want it.

278
00:10:45,909 --> 00:10:47,149
I want it.

279
00:10:49,629 --> 00:10:50,789
Why do you come here

280
00:10:51,109 --> 00:10:52,069
without the adults?

281
00:10:52,429 --> 00:10:53,669
Why do you come here

282
00:10:53,669 --> 00:10:54,749
without the adults?

283
00:10:57,229 --> 00:10:58,469
Naughty boy.

284
00:10:58,829 --> 00:11:00,349
He promised to buy me a meal.

285
00:11:00,709 --> 00:11:02,109
My mother is waiting outside.

286
00:11:04,469 --> 00:11:06,069
It seems you get along quite well.

287
00:11:06,349 --> 00:11:07,669
Thanks to your help.

288
00:11:10,829 --> 00:11:11,709
Lin Xi.

289
00:11:12,749 --> 00:11:14,749
Can you give us the toys

290
00:11:14,749 --> 00:11:15,749
in your hands?

291
00:11:17,309 --> 00:11:17,989
This...

292
00:11:20,669 --> 00:11:21,949
I will give them to you if you want.

293
00:11:22,789 --> 00:11:23,589
Thank you, Xi.

294
00:11:23,589 --> 00:11:24,429
Hey.

295
00:11:24,629 --> 00:11:25,349
You can't take them.

296
00:11:26,829 --> 00:11:28,109
These toys are so cute.

297
00:11:28,109 --> 00:11:29,069
Here, take these.

298
00:11:29,229 --> 00:11:31,749
Look at the toys. They are awfully made.

299
00:11:32,029 --> 00:11:33,789
We want that two.

300
00:11:33,789 --> 00:11:35,149
I just like them very much.

301
00:11:35,149 --> 00:11:36,269
She just offered to give it to you.

302
00:11:36,269 --> 00:11:37,749
Didn't you reject it?

303
00:11:38,109 --> 00:11:39,229
I'm taking it now.

304
00:11:39,789 --> 00:11:41,749
Why is the change?

305
00:11:42,149 --> 00:11:43,789
I want to give it to Wang Dong.

306
00:11:43,789 --> 00:11:44,749
Wang Dong likes it.

307
00:11:45,229 --> 00:11:46,829
Lin Xi likes it too.

308
00:11:51,149 --> 00:11:53,109
I'm not going to argue with grown-ups.

309
00:11:53,189 --> 00:11:53,869
Let's leave.

310
00:12:02,869 --> 00:12:03,949
Oh my.

311
00:12:04,709 --> 00:12:05,389
Why did you fight

312
00:12:05,389 --> 00:12:06,829
over the toys with kids?

313
00:12:07,029 --> 00:12:08,549
Kids can't be spoiled.

314
00:12:08,549 --> 00:12:09,949
They must be taught how to show respect.

315
00:12:25,869 --> 00:12:26,509
Lin Xi.

316
00:12:29,429 --> 00:12:31,189
Why do you look anxious?

317
00:12:31,189 --> 00:12:31,869
Look at this.

318
00:12:32,389 --> 00:12:33,109
I've checked the link

319
00:12:33,109 --> 00:12:34,429
written on the ticket website.

320
00:12:34,429 --> 00:12:35,309
And I found something weird

321
00:12:35,309 --> 00:12:36,749
about the ticket website's
and the organizer's domain name.

322
00:12:37,109 --> 00:12:38,709
The webpage of the music festival
was weird too.

323
00:12:38,709 --> 00:12:39,669
I discovered

324
00:12:39,949 --> 00:12:41,109
that the link was a fake one.

325
00:12:41,309 --> 00:12:42,309
What do you mean?

326
00:12:43,069 --> 00:12:44,349
If I'm not wrong,

327
00:12:44,669 --> 00:12:46,149
the ticket for this music festival
is fake.

328
00:12:46,509 --> 00:12:47,589
Jiang Yimian got scammed.

329
00:12:47,749 --> 00:12:48,629
No way.

330
00:13:01,429 --> 00:13:02,549
What do we do now?

331
00:13:03,149 --> 00:13:05,349
Are you sure the music festival is fake?

332
00:13:05,749 --> 00:13:06,269
Lin Xi and I

333
00:13:06,269 --> 00:13:08,309
tried to call the organizer just now.

334
00:13:09,189 --> 00:13:10,149
No one answered it.

335
00:13:10,429 --> 00:13:12,109
Even the number is fake.

336
00:13:12,309 --> 00:13:13,909
The scammer is just bold.

337
00:13:15,189 --> 00:13:16,469
What do we do now?

338
00:13:17,309 --> 00:13:18,669
Why hesitate?

339
00:13:18,669 --> 00:13:19,629
Just tell her directly.

340
00:13:19,629 --> 00:13:20,469
Isn't it settled?

341
00:13:20,469 --> 00:13:21,549
Let's not be so direct.

342
00:13:22,189 --> 00:13:23,589
What if she can't come around
to the truth?

343
00:13:25,709 --> 00:13:27,189
I'm afraid two people will be harmed
by this.

344
00:13:27,549 --> 00:13:28,629
What do you mean?

345
00:13:28,989 --> 00:13:30,149
If she's upset,

346
00:13:30,349 --> 00:13:31,549
my heart breaks too.

347
00:13:33,029 --> 00:13:33,989
Don't be exaggerating.

348
00:13:34,509 --> 00:13:35,909
Still, we have to tell the truth.

349
00:13:39,989 --> 00:13:41,349
I think

350
00:13:42,629 --> 00:13:44,869
we can tell her in gradual stages.

351
00:13:46,629 --> 00:13:47,669
What do you mean?

352
00:13:49,669 --> 00:13:52,229
Plan A, remind her tactfully.

353
00:13:53,229 --> 00:13:54,709
Will it be possible

354
00:13:54,709 --> 00:13:56,269
that you fail to meet
someone you expected to see

355
00:13:56,269 --> 00:13:57,789
in the concert?

356
00:13:57,789 --> 00:13:58,949
Impossible.

357
00:13:58,949 --> 00:13:59,989
I will shove over to the front

358
00:13:59,989 --> 00:14:01,109
and I can see the band.

359
00:14:03,989 --> 00:14:05,349
There is always something unexpected
to occur, you know.

360
00:14:05,749 --> 00:14:07,509
What if your favorite band
doesn't show up?

361
00:14:07,509 --> 00:14:08,789
If so, I will watch the performance
of other bands.

362
00:14:08,789 --> 00:14:09,669
There are so many bands there.

363
00:14:09,669 --> 00:14:10,829
What if surprises happen.

364
00:14:12,789 --> 00:14:15,389
Plan B, hint her.

365
00:14:23,709 --> 00:14:24,869
The Magician card
is in reversed position.

366
00:14:25,389 --> 00:14:26,909
It indicates you have walked
in the wrong direction.

367
00:14:26,909 --> 00:14:28,189
Failure and scam.

368
00:14:28,589 --> 00:14:30,149
It means you can't attend

369
00:14:30,149 --> 00:14:31,629
the music festival.

370
00:14:31,829 --> 00:14:32,909
You read it from the opposite direction.

371
00:14:32,909 --> 00:14:34,309
It is not reversed from my view.

372
00:14:34,709 --> 00:14:36,029
Even the heavens help me.

373
00:14:36,229 --> 00:14:37,709
Everything must go smoothly.

374
00:14:41,269 --> 00:14:41,909
Good girl.

375
00:14:42,669 --> 00:14:44,629
The final plan, tell her directly.

376
00:14:50,229 --> 00:14:51,189
You scared me.

377
00:14:51,389 --> 00:14:52,629
There is something I need to tell you.

378
00:14:52,989 --> 00:14:53,989
The ticket is fake.

379
00:14:54,429 --> 00:14:55,149
It can't be fake

380
00:14:55,149 --> 00:14:56,149
even if you are fake.

381
00:14:56,149 --> 00:14:57,149
It's real that the ticket is fake.

382
00:14:57,149 --> 00:14:57,829
This ticket is fake for real.

383
00:14:57,829 --> 00:14:58,829
Even if you receive the ticket,

384
00:14:58,829 --> 00:14:59,469
it is still a fake one.

385
00:14:59,469 --> 00:15:00,749
Are you doing some sort
of tongue twister?

386
00:15:01,069 --> 00:15:02,109
What if I receive the ticket?

387
00:15:02,309 --> 00:15:03,309
The thunder will strike me down.

388
00:15:03,309 --> 00:15:03,949
Jiang Yimian.

389
00:15:04,189 --> 00:15:05,149
Here is your parcel.

390
00:15:05,429 --> 00:15:06,469
I got it for you.

391
00:15:06,469 --> 00:15:07,349
Thank you.

392
00:15:07,349 --> 00:15:08,549
It must be the ticket.

393
00:15:13,869 --> 00:15:15,309
It's my ticket.

394
00:15:15,309 --> 00:15:16,189
I got it.

395
00:15:16,589 --> 00:15:17,509
Look at this with your eyes, Xie Ang.

396
00:15:18,269 --> 00:15:19,869
The thunder is going to strike you down.

397
00:15:22,869 --> 00:15:25,549
Even the ticket is forged delicately.

398
00:15:27,029 --> 00:15:28,389
It costs 388 yuan.

399
00:15:28,669 --> 00:15:29,909
Of course it is.

400
00:15:33,640 --> 00:15:35,020
(Grade 2, Class 1)

401
00:15:35,989 --> 00:15:37,189
Quiet.

402
00:15:37,789 --> 00:15:39,229
Haven't you seen rain before?

403
00:15:39,229 --> 00:15:44,829
Power cut-off, please.
Class ends, please.

404
00:15:47,189 --> 00:15:48,629
The prayer does work.

405
00:15:51,149 --> 00:15:52,589
Stop making a fuss.

406
00:15:58,029 --> 00:15:58,549
Great.

407
00:15:58,549 --> 00:16:00,069
Perhaps the self-study session
will be cancelled.

408
00:16:00,189 --> 00:16:01,109
That's possible.

409
00:16:03,069 --> 00:16:04,709
You are too optimistic.

410
00:16:05,109 --> 00:16:05,949
I bet Mr. Xie

411
00:16:05,949 --> 00:16:08,029
will ask us to continue our study
with the torch on.

412
00:16:11,629 --> 00:16:12,949
Students who have torch lights,

413
00:16:13,309 --> 00:16:14,589
switch them on.

414
00:16:15,389 --> 00:16:17,349
I will go and check it out.

415
00:16:17,349 --> 00:16:18,069
Class representative.

416
00:16:18,309 --> 00:16:18,749
Jinx it.

417
00:16:18,749 --> 00:16:20,029
Look after the class.

418
00:16:20,029 --> 00:16:21,629
No problem. Don't worry.

419
00:16:26,389 --> 00:16:27,589
Students.

420
00:16:27,589 --> 00:16:29,389
The tea party begins.

421
00:16:31,109 --> 00:16:32,389
Keep your voice low.

422
00:16:32,389 --> 00:16:32,949
Hey.

423
00:16:32,949 --> 00:16:34,669
Don't you create grudges for me
and my father.

424
00:16:39,789 --> 00:16:40,949
What are you reading?

425
00:16:40,949 --> 00:16:42,069
It's the book you borrowed for me.

426
00:16:42,229 --> 00:16:43,029
Appreciation of Music.

427
00:16:52,309 --> 00:16:53,549
You shall advise her well.

428
00:16:58,589 --> 00:16:59,149
Hi.

429
00:16:59,149 --> 00:17:00,709
Mianmian, the ticket...

430
00:17:01,549 --> 00:17:03,029
If you dare say it is a fake ticket,

431
00:17:03,029 --> 00:17:04,109
our friendship ends here.

432
00:17:05,189 --> 00:17:06,789
No, I'm not.

433
00:17:07,149 --> 00:17:08,269
I bring you some flower seeds.

434
00:17:08,749 --> 00:17:10,029
I can unshell it for you.

435
00:17:10,429 --> 00:17:10,989
Sure.

436
00:17:14,549 --> 00:17:17,029
Huh? He is eating flower seeds now.

437
00:17:17,029 --> 00:17:19,309
Xie Ang is defeated.

438
00:17:34,789 --> 00:17:35,709
My old tablemate.

439
00:17:37,229 --> 00:17:39,069
How do you feel

440
00:17:39,069 --> 00:17:39,909
returning here?

441
00:17:40,389 --> 00:17:41,829
My new seat is just half a meter
from here though.

442
00:17:41,829 --> 00:17:43,349
It is not far at all.

443
00:17:49,189 --> 00:17:51,109
It has been some time
since we've had such a leisure time

444
00:17:51,109 --> 00:17:52,749
during the self-study session.

445
00:17:53,189 --> 00:17:54,389
It will be great

446
00:17:54,389 --> 00:17:56,549
to listen to a soothing song

447
00:17:57,509 --> 00:17:58,509
right now.

448
00:18:05,589 --> 00:18:07,309
Why did you take the phone out?

449
00:18:09,949 --> 00:18:10,589
Music?

450
00:18:11,109 --> 00:18:11,869
Sure.

451
00:18:27,749 --> 00:18:28,909
Oh, this song.

452
00:18:32,389 --> 00:18:33,109
It's nice, right?

453
00:18:34,029 --> 00:18:34,829
Yes.

454
00:18:38,029 --> 00:18:38,749
Hold on.

455
00:18:39,229 --> 00:18:40,869
I will build a soundproof environment

456
00:18:41,589 --> 00:18:43,949
with a surrounding sound.

471
00:19:27,909 --> 00:19:29,069
in that essay regarding your idol?

472
00:19:30,549 --> 00:19:32,669
It's not a particular person.

473
00:19:34,349 --> 00:19:35,149
Actually,

474
00:19:35,149 --> 00:19:36,469
I admire

475
00:19:36,469 --> 00:19:37,389
doctors very much.

476
00:19:38,109 --> 00:19:39,749
I want to go to Jinghua University

477
00:19:39,749 --> 00:19:41,149
because of its medical school.

478
00:19:44,549 --> 00:19:45,349
What about you?

479
00:19:46,229 --> 00:19:47,829
Which university do you want to go to?

480
00:19:50,509 --> 00:19:52,189
Dad, you asked for me?

481
00:19:52,789 --> 00:19:53,389
Have a seat.

482
00:19:57,389 --> 00:19:59,229
Get ready for this.

483
00:19:59,709 --> 00:20:01,669
Regarding the information
for applying to NIT,

484
00:20:01,669 --> 00:20:04,309
Mr. Chen has made a list for you.

485
00:20:04,420 --> 00:20:06,646
(Situ Institute of Technology)

486
00:20:08,189 --> 00:20:08,829
Dad.

487
00:20:10,869 --> 00:20:12,029
Must I go to this school?

488
00:20:13,229 --> 00:20:14,709
Situ's Business School

489
00:20:14,709 --> 00:20:16,229
is the world's top university.

490
00:20:17,149 --> 00:20:19,789
We need people with
a business education background

491
00:20:19,789 --> 00:20:20,989
in the industry

492
00:20:20,989 --> 00:20:22,029
of precision instruments.

493
00:20:22,749 --> 00:20:25,469
Even if you want to start up a business
in the future,

494
00:20:25,469 --> 00:20:27,829
the resource and background
of this school

495
00:20:27,829 --> 00:20:29,549
is a great help to you.

496
00:20:33,429 --> 00:20:34,349
I know.

497
00:20:35,229 --> 00:20:36,309
But

498
00:20:36,869 --> 00:20:38,109
I don't feel like studying overseas.

499
00:20:43,549 --> 00:20:44,269
Junxing.

500
00:20:45,429 --> 00:20:48,269
I thought we had reached a consensus

501
00:20:48,269 --> 00:20:50,149
on the NIT.

502
00:20:53,149 --> 00:20:54,429
I haven't made up my mind yet.

503
00:20:54,709 --> 00:20:55,829
No way.

504
00:20:55,949 --> 00:20:56,549
How could an ace student like you

505
00:20:56,549 --> 00:20:57,949
have no goals?

506
00:21:00,989 --> 00:21:02,469
Well.

507
00:21:05,349 --> 00:21:07,189
Though I'm not willing,
I will invite you to my school.

508
00:21:07,829 --> 00:21:09,309
Let's go to Jinghua University together.

509
00:21:12,229 --> 00:21:13,589
Invite me to your school?

510
00:21:15,549 --> 00:21:17,069
I need time to consider it.

511
00:21:45,149 --> 00:21:46,509
Is the flower seed nice?

512
00:21:46,509 --> 00:21:47,349
Yes.

513
00:21:48,269 --> 00:21:49,029
Dad.

514
00:21:49,029 --> 00:21:50,269
How dare you!

515
00:21:51,149 --> 00:21:53,069
Put all the prohibited items
on the table.

516
00:21:53,069 --> 00:21:54,269
Put it on the table.

517
00:21:56,109 --> 00:21:57,389
What nonsense book is this?

518
00:21:57,389 --> 00:21:59,109
Mr. Xie. It's not a nonsense book.

519
00:21:59,109 --> 00:22:00,509
It's a reference book.

520
00:22:00,509 --> 00:22:01,989
Basic Music Theory.

521
00:22:02,389 --> 00:22:03,869
Do you like music?

522
00:22:06,069 --> 00:22:06,909
Jiang Yimian.

523
00:22:07,389 --> 00:22:09,109
Should I transfer you to the art class?

524
00:22:09,389 --> 00:22:10,989
No, no need.

525
00:22:10,989 --> 00:22:12,189
I will confiscate it.

526
00:22:12,189 --> 00:22:13,109
Mr. Xie.

527
00:22:13,109 --> 00:22:14,269
You better study the textbook.

528
00:22:15,389 --> 00:22:16,389
Game console.

529
00:22:26,269 --> 00:22:27,189
Lin Xi.

530
00:22:33,789 --> 00:22:35,669
It seems they are focused on the study

531
00:22:36,029 --> 00:22:37,469
and they are not aware
the light is on.

532
00:22:38,709 --> 00:22:40,029
What are you doing?

533
00:22:42,149 --> 00:22:43,389
Hey, you.

534
00:22:44,629 --> 00:22:45,669
Mr. Xie.

535
00:22:47,149 --> 00:22:47,989
The lights are on.

536
00:22:48,469 --> 00:22:49,389
Great.

537
00:22:51,189 --> 00:22:52,109
What are you up to?

538
00:22:53,429 --> 00:22:54,909
Mr. Xie, I'm teaching her

539
00:22:54,909 --> 00:22:56,109
this question.

540
00:22:57,469 --> 00:22:59,149
I've tried it many times.

541
00:22:59,149 --> 00:23:00,469
But it's still wrong.

542
00:23:00,469 --> 00:23:01,749
Oh, you're studying.

543
00:23:03,789 --> 00:23:05,509
This question is quite difficult.

544
00:23:08,109 --> 00:23:09,429
Look at them.

545
00:23:09,909 --> 00:23:11,469
You should learn from them.

546
00:23:11,469 --> 00:23:12,509
They are so focused

547
00:23:12,509 --> 00:23:13,469
on the study.

548
00:23:13,469 --> 00:23:15,189
Look at yourself.

549
00:23:15,189 --> 00:23:15,709
When I was away,

550
00:23:15,709 --> 00:23:17,069
look what you've done.

551
00:23:17,069 --> 00:23:17,949
You study knowledge

552
00:23:17,949 --> 00:23:19,269
for your own good.

553
00:23:23,189 --> 00:23:24,149
Please study well.

554
00:23:27,189 --> 00:23:27,909
Give it to me.

555
00:23:28,909 --> 00:23:29,669
Surrender it.

556
00:23:31,429 --> 00:23:32,389
Surrender it.

557
00:23:38,789 --> 00:23:39,829
What are you laughing at?

558
00:23:40,429 --> 00:23:41,989
You are in grade two now.
Don't act like a child.

559
00:23:58,269 --> 00:24:00,229
I left my ticket in the book.

560
00:24:06,109 --> 00:24:07,349
What do I do now?

561
00:24:18,469 --> 00:24:19,589
Is everyone here?

562
00:24:20,229 --> 00:24:21,269
Answer me.

563
00:24:25,309 --> 00:24:26,589
Mr. Xie.

564
00:24:27,029 --> 00:24:28,709
Please return my book.

565
00:24:28,709 --> 00:24:29,709
I won't read it again

566
00:24:29,709 --> 00:24:30,429
during the lectures.

567
00:24:30,429 --> 00:24:31,189
I promise.

568
00:24:31,789 --> 00:24:32,669
- Me too.
- Me too.

569
00:24:32,669 --> 00:24:33,669
Me too.

570
00:24:35,509 --> 00:24:37,029
You want your things back?

571
00:24:38,709 --> 00:24:40,309
Well, you can.

572
00:24:40,309 --> 00:24:41,669
But on a condition.

573
00:24:42,069 --> 00:24:43,389
You must get 130 marks at least

574
00:24:43,389 --> 00:24:45,069
in the maths paper
of the coming monthly test.

575
00:24:45,069 --> 00:24:46,189
- Huh?
- Huh?

576
00:24:47,749 --> 00:24:48,869
Do you still want your things back?

577
00:24:50,309 --> 00:24:52,589
- No.
- No.

578
00:24:53,549 --> 00:24:55,309
No.

579
00:24:58,069 --> 00:24:59,229
Mr. Xie.

580
00:24:59,229 --> 00:25:00,429
I want.

581
00:25:01,709 --> 00:25:03,229
Are you sure you can get 130 marks?

582
00:25:06,469 --> 00:25:07,349
How was it?

583
00:25:07,349 --> 00:25:08,549
Did my dad return the book?

584
00:25:09,269 --> 00:25:10,069
No.

585
00:25:17,269 --> 00:25:18,189
It's fine.

586
00:25:18,189 --> 00:25:19,589
You can go to the music festival
next time.

587
00:25:19,589 --> 00:25:20,669
I will go with you then.

588
00:25:20,669 --> 00:25:22,029
That's right. You can go next time.

589
00:25:23,709 --> 00:25:26,069
Who knows when
the music festival will be held again.

590
00:25:28,189 --> 00:25:29,749
I promised your dad

591
00:25:29,749 --> 00:25:30,789
that I would achieve 130 marks

592
00:25:30,789 --> 00:25:32,069
in the upcoming maths test

593
00:25:32,069 --> 00:25:33,149
and he would return the book.

594
00:25:34,789 --> 00:25:35,749
I need revision now.

595
00:25:35,749 --> 00:25:36,829
Please help me with the revision.

596
00:25:36,829 --> 00:25:37,989
Let's start today.

597
00:26:00,509 --> 00:26:03,189
Hence, y equals 3x.

598
00:26:07,469 --> 00:26:08,389
Got it?

599
00:26:10,389 --> 00:26:11,629
I don't get it.

600
00:26:11,989 --> 00:26:13,549
Can you please repeat it?

601
00:26:22,029 --> 00:26:23,149
It's late now

602
00:26:23,709 --> 00:26:24,829
and everyone is tired.

603
00:26:25,309 --> 00:26:27,349
Let's call it a day.

604
00:26:28,109 --> 00:26:28,749
That's right.

605
00:26:28,749 --> 00:26:30,789
Study in just one night won't help much.

606
00:26:31,669 --> 00:26:32,549
Why not?

607
00:26:32,869 --> 00:26:33,949
I found

608
00:26:33,949 --> 00:26:35,869
that there were thirty key points
that I wasn't familiar with.

609
00:26:35,869 --> 00:26:36,949
I should master more than five of them

610
00:26:36,949 --> 00:26:38,229
every day

611
00:26:38,229 --> 00:26:39,509
in order to achieve 130 marks

612
00:26:39,509 --> 00:26:40,669
before the music festival.

613
00:26:40,909 --> 00:26:42,029
Besides, I need to do exercises later.

614
00:26:42,029 --> 00:26:42,749
Every night is crucial

615
00:26:42,749 --> 00:26:44,229
for me.

616
00:26:44,909 --> 00:26:46,429
If you are going to study in this way,

617
00:26:46,669 --> 00:26:48,029
probably we will be sent to the hospital

618
00:26:48,309 --> 00:26:49,829
even before the test starts.

619
00:26:52,269 --> 00:26:54,469
You will never know this is a blessing
in disguise.

620
00:26:54,789 --> 00:26:56,029
Perhaps something good will happen

621
00:26:56,029 --> 00:26:57,349
if you can't achieve the score.

622
00:26:57,989 --> 00:26:58,789
That's right.

623
00:26:58,989 --> 00:27:00,309
You can go to the concert

624
00:27:00,309 --> 00:27:01,989
next time.

625
00:27:08,869 --> 00:27:10,829
Do you think it is just a whimsy thought
to go to the concert?

626
00:27:10,829 --> 00:27:12,229
No, it's not.

627
00:27:12,829 --> 00:27:14,149
I've been waiting for years

628
00:27:14,349 --> 00:27:16,069
for this opportunity

629
00:27:16,349 --> 00:27:18,069
to listen to their song
in a live concert.

630
00:27:23,069 --> 00:27:24,749
Let's go to the concert next time.

631
00:27:24,749 --> 00:27:26,069
I will help you with the ticket money.

632
00:27:26,909 --> 00:27:28,509
How long will it take
for the next concert to come?

633
00:27:31,109 --> 00:27:32,669
The guitarist got sick and passed away

634
00:27:33,069 --> 00:27:34,269
a year before.

635
00:27:34,949 --> 00:27:36,869
There won't be many chances left.

636
00:27:38,109 --> 00:27:39,869
I won't want my youth to be left
with regrets

637
00:27:40,589 --> 00:27:42,629
because I sit idly by.

638
00:27:45,869 --> 00:27:46,589
Mianmian.

639
00:27:46,949 --> 00:27:48,109
Actually, the music festival...

640
00:27:48,109 --> 00:27:48,989
Lin Xi,

641
00:27:49,629 --> 00:27:51,149
you want to go to Jinghua University.

642
00:27:52,469 --> 00:27:53,389
Ji Junxing,

643
00:27:54,189 --> 00:27:55,349
you like programming.

644
00:27:58,629 --> 00:27:59,469
Gao Yunlang,

645
00:28:00,509 --> 00:28:01,429
you like playing basketball.

646
00:28:02,309 --> 00:28:03,189
And Chen Mo,

647
00:28:04,029 --> 00:28:05,389
you are obsessed with physics.

648
00:28:07,909 --> 00:28:08,629
Xie Ang.

649
00:28:09,869 --> 00:28:11,229
You have been wanting to start up
a business.

650
00:28:13,989 --> 00:28:15,509
Everything you like

651
00:28:16,749 --> 00:28:18,189
and are passionate about

652
00:28:20,069 --> 00:28:21,429
is respected by others.

653
00:28:23,989 --> 00:28:27,029
All I want

654
00:28:27,709 --> 00:28:29,629
is to go to a live concert

655
00:28:30,029 --> 00:28:31,749
because I love music.

656
00:28:33,149 --> 00:28:34,989
Why doesn't my wish

657
00:28:36,349 --> 00:28:38,389
deserve your respect?

658
00:28:38,389 --> 00:28:40,349
Why do you keep denying it?

659
00:28:41,029 --> 00:28:41,669
Mianmian.

660
00:28:42,949 --> 00:28:43,989
Don't cry, Mianmian.

661
00:28:46,789 --> 00:28:48,109
We didn't mean to hurt you.

662
00:28:48,109 --> 00:28:48,869
It's fine.

663
00:28:52,069 --> 00:28:54,069
Anyway, I won't allow any regrets.

664
00:28:58,429 --> 00:28:59,709
It's fine if you don't want to help me.

665
00:29:00,309 --> 00:29:01,429
I can do it myself.

666
00:29:05,989 --> 00:29:06,429
Mianmian.

667
00:29:06,429 --> 00:29:07,069
Jiang Yimian.

668
00:29:07,309 --> 00:29:07,989
Mianmian.

669
00:29:09,269 --> 00:29:09,909
Mianmian.

670
00:29:31,469 --> 00:29:32,069
I think

671
00:29:32,709 --> 00:29:34,109
we should help her with the revision.

672
00:29:35,669 --> 00:29:36,909
Are you sure?

673
00:29:37,949 --> 00:29:39,109
If she is given hope now,

674
00:29:39,509 --> 00:29:40,909
she will be even more disappointed

675
00:29:41,509 --> 00:29:42,509
when she knows the truth.

676
00:29:42,829 --> 00:29:44,389
She is trying every possible mean

677
00:29:44,949 --> 00:29:46,069
to enhance herself to be up to mark

678
00:29:46,509 --> 00:29:47,829
for the beautiful hope

679
00:29:47,829 --> 00:29:48,829
that is to meet them.

680
00:29:49,269 --> 00:29:50,909
She is trying really hard
to improve herself.

681
00:29:51,189 --> 00:29:52,229
Don't you think

682
00:29:52,229 --> 00:29:53,349
she's brave?

683
00:29:57,429 --> 00:29:58,349
We all know

684
00:29:58,949 --> 00:30:00,069
that we should go all out

685
00:30:00,309 --> 00:30:01,829
for something we yearn for.

686
00:30:02,109 --> 00:30:03,829
Nothing can halt us.

687
00:30:05,269 --> 00:30:05,949
So,

688
00:30:06,429 --> 00:30:08,109
regardless of whether the music festival
is fake or not,

689
00:30:09,109 --> 00:30:10,349
we shall stay beside her

690
00:30:10,349 --> 00:30:11,709
when she is pursuing her goal.

691
00:30:12,269 --> 00:30:13,989
Isn't that more important?

692
00:30:19,629 --> 00:30:20,389
Where are you going?

693
00:30:22,509 --> 00:30:23,989
I will sort out the maths notes
for Jiang Yimian.

694
00:30:25,189 --> 00:30:25,989
Wait for me, Xie Ang.

695
00:30:28,109 --> 00:30:28,949
I'm in too.

696
00:30:30,269 --> 00:30:30,949
And me.

697
00:30:32,349 --> 00:30:33,229
We will join too.

698
00:30:35,829 --> 00:30:36,589
I didn't know

699
00:30:37,349 --> 00:30:38,309
the East Gate Squad

700
00:30:38,309 --> 00:30:39,629
is so united.

701
00:30:39,869 --> 00:30:40,629
Of course.

702
00:30:47,549 --> 00:30:48,349
Are you done?

703
00:30:53,469 --> 00:30:54,429
This is done too.

704
00:30:57,909 --> 00:30:58,469
Chen Mo.

705
00:31:23,066 --> 00:31:26,440
(Time Band New Album)

706
00:31:35,349 --> 00:31:37,069
Jiang Yimian, you can do it.

707
00:31:47,949 --> 00:31:48,669
All right.

708
00:31:48,989 --> 00:31:49,789
Time is up.

709
00:31:50,189 --> 00:31:50,909
Stop writing.

710
00:32:12,469 --> 00:32:12,989
Come on.

711
00:32:13,709 --> 00:32:15,069
Come on.

712
00:32:19,069 --> 00:32:19,629
Come in.

713
00:32:19,629 --> 00:32:20,429
Mr. Xie.

714
00:32:20,429 --> 00:32:21,549
I would like to ask

715
00:32:21,549 --> 00:32:22,669
about my test result.

716
00:32:25,349 --> 00:32:26,829
Do you wish that she can get 130?

717
00:32:27,189 --> 00:32:28,469
I'm having mixed feelings now.

718
00:32:29,149 --> 00:32:30,389
It's my first time seeing her
striving so hard for a goal.

719
00:32:30,389 --> 00:32:32,669
But, even if she got the marks,

720
00:32:32,869 --> 00:32:33,949
the ticket is still a fake one.

721
00:32:33,949 --> 00:32:35,349
It's still a false hope.

722
00:32:35,509 --> 00:32:37,509
Here, check it yourself.

723
00:32:40,909 --> 00:32:42,629
132 marks.

724
00:32:42,749 --> 00:32:43,269
Thank you, Mr. Xie.

725
00:32:43,269 --> 00:32:44,509
Here. Take this back.

726
00:32:44,589 --> 00:32:45,549
Thank you, Mr. Xie.

727
00:32:45,549 --> 00:32:46,989
Thank you so much.

728
00:32:48,709 --> 00:32:50,629
I got 132 marks.

729
00:32:51,349 --> 00:32:52,949
I got 132 marks.

730
00:32:53,109 --> 00:32:54,469
Thank you, everyone.

731
00:32:54,469 --> 00:32:55,389
Thank you so much. I mean it.

732
00:32:55,389 --> 00:32:56,709
Without you,

733
00:32:56,709 --> 00:32:57,629
it is impossible

734
00:32:57,629 --> 00:32:59,269
for me to get this mark

735
00:32:59,269 --> 00:33:00,269
as well as

736
00:33:00,269 --> 00:33:02,269
to get back the ticket.

737
00:33:03,069 --> 00:33:03,829
Well,

738
00:33:03,829 --> 00:33:05,029
I need to go back

739
00:33:05,069 --> 00:33:06,389
and get ready for the concert.

740
00:33:06,869 --> 00:33:07,669
I shall leave first.

741
00:33:08,349 --> 00:33:11,349
Today is a great day.

742
00:33:11,349 --> 00:33:14,349
All dreams have come true.

743
00:33:14,749 --> 00:33:17,109
It seems we have to think of something

744
00:33:17,109 --> 00:33:18,989
to minimize the harm to her.

745
00:33:20,509 --> 00:33:21,829
I have Plan B.

746
00:33:22,789 --> 00:33:24,189
But I need your cooperation.

What's wrong with you all?

754
00:33:59,829 --> 00:34:00,509
Gao Yunlang.

755
00:34:00,669 --> 00:34:01,669
You are playing the bass,

756
00:34:01,669 --> 00:34:02,589
not the electric guitar.

757
00:34:03,109 --> 00:34:04,469
Use two fingers only.

758
00:34:04,469 --> 00:34:05,229
Well,

759
00:34:05,509 --> 00:34:07,589
I just play it for fun at home.

760
00:34:07,589 --> 00:34:09,509
I have never collaborated with someone
in the band.

761
00:34:10,909 --> 00:34:12,149
And you too, Lin Xi.

762
00:34:12,589 --> 00:34:14,349
Didn't you learn to play the drum
for three years?

763
00:34:15,109 --> 00:34:16,469
I learned it
when I was in elementary school.

764
00:34:16,469 --> 00:34:17,429
I'm out of practice.

765
00:34:19,549 --> 00:34:21,469
Only the vocalist and keyboardist
do better.

766
00:34:21,869 --> 00:34:22,429
We just

767
00:34:22,429 --> 00:34:23,789
have no talents in this.

768
00:34:26,029 --> 00:34:27,149
I don't think

769
00:34:27,149 --> 00:34:28,629
we can prepare a watchable performance

770
00:34:28,629 --> 00:34:29,549
for Jiang Yimian

771
00:34:29,549 --> 00:34:30,909
in such a short period.

772
00:34:34,589 --> 00:34:35,669
I have no confidence either.

773
00:34:43,829 --> 00:34:44,709
Are you playing band here?

774
00:34:45,709 --> 00:34:46,749
Are you in trouble?

775
00:34:46,909 --> 00:34:48,429
You can seek help from me.

776
00:34:49,189 --> 00:34:50,389
I can help you.

777
00:34:51,349 --> 00:34:52,469
What can you do?

778
00:35:15,549 --> 00:35:16,789
Not bad.

779
00:35:17,149 --> 00:35:17,829
How is it?

780
00:35:18,109 --> 00:35:19,869
My friends are quite professional,
right?

781
00:35:20,309 --> 00:35:21,389
Yes, they are.

782
00:35:21,389 --> 00:35:23,669
However, we can't master the instrument

783
00:35:24,549 --> 00:35:26,429
in such a short period.

784
00:35:26,869 --> 00:35:28,909
Take your time to learn it.

785
00:35:28,909 --> 00:35:30,469
You will do better one day.

786
00:35:31,509 --> 00:35:32,909
We are lacking skills

787
00:35:32,909 --> 00:35:34,829
and this song is too hard for us.

788
00:35:34,829 --> 00:35:36,229
As for the ensemble in the last part,

789
00:35:36,229 --> 00:35:37,709
I suppose we need three months
to practice.

790
00:35:38,709 --> 00:35:39,829
Not really.

791
00:35:40,149 --> 00:35:40,909
Well.

792
00:35:40,909 --> 00:35:42,069
There is a saying

793
00:35:42,069 --> 00:35:42,989
spreading amongst artists like us,

794
00:35:42,989 --> 00:35:45,749
"instead of performing,
it's better to imitate".

795
00:35:46,509 --> 00:35:47,069
I think

796
00:35:47,069 --> 00:35:49,349
you don't have
to really perform the song

797
00:35:49,629 --> 00:35:50,349
but you act as if you can perform it.

798
00:35:55,589 --> 00:35:56,629
I think I get it.

799
00:36:05,029 --> 00:36:05,789
Jiang Yimian.

800
00:36:06,349 --> 00:36:07,509
Have a great day.

801
00:36:08,029 --> 00:36:08,749
Today will be

802
00:36:08,749 --> 00:36:10,389
the happiest day for me.

803
00:36:29,069 --> 00:36:29,789
Miss.

804
00:36:30,269 --> 00:36:31,309
Where are you going?

805
00:36:31,509 --> 00:36:33,029
I'm going to a music festival, sir.

806
00:36:33,029 --> 00:36:34,349
I'm going to meet my favorite band.

807
00:36:34,789 --> 00:36:36,149
Have you heard of their new song before?

808
00:36:36,309 --> 00:36:36,909
Life and me.

809
00:36:36,909 --> 00:36:37,949
It is my life.

810
00:36:38,109 --> 00:36:39,629
It is going to be a great show for sure.

What should I do with this?

817
00:36:53,069 --> 00:36:54,269
We travelled far to here.

818

That's right.

819
00:36:55,069 --> 00:36:56,229
Obviously, this is a fake ticket.

820
00:36:56,229 --> 00:36:56,949
Something is wrong
with the date mentioned on the ticket.

821
00:36:56,949 --> 00:36:57,949
We didn't receive any information

822
00:36:57,949 --> 00:36:59,429
about the concert event today.

823
00:36:59,429 --> 00:37:00,389
What's wrong with the ticket you bought?

824
00:37:00,389 --> 00:37:01,789
How could it be possible?

825
00:37:01,949 --> 00:37:03,269
What the hell is this?

826
00:37:03,269 --> 00:37:04,149
We spent 200 yuan to reach here.

827
00:37:04,149 --> 00:37:04,549
Your ticket

828
00:37:04,549 --> 00:37:05,909
isn't printed with
the official seal, date

829
00:37:05,909 --> 00:37:06,869
and the address.

830
00:37:06,869 --> 00:37:08,069
What do we do now?

831
00:37:08,069 --> 00:37:10,469
We bought the ticket
from the official channel.

832
00:37:13,349 --> 00:37:15,309
Hello.

833
00:37:15,309 --> 00:37:16,109
What's going on now?

834
00:37:16,509 --> 00:37:18,069
You are here for the music festival,
right?

835
00:37:18,349 --> 00:37:19,429
We got scammed.

836
00:37:19,949 --> 00:37:20,949
What do you mean?

837
00:37:21,309 --> 00:37:21,869
How could it be possible?

838
00:37:21,869 --> 00:37:22,909
I even got the ticket with me.

839
00:37:22,909 --> 00:37:23,629
Police said

840
00:37:23,629 --> 00:37:24,749
it was the scammer who spread

841
00:37:24,749 --> 00:37:25,789
the fake link on the website

842
00:37:25,789 --> 00:37:27,229
and many people were scammed.

843
00:37:27,709 --> 00:37:29,789
At least I bought the ticket
that was only worth 188 yuan.

844
00:37:29,789 --> 00:37:30,549
What about yours?

845
00:37:31,149 --> 00:37:31,789
I...

846
00:37:34,429 --> 00:37:35,349
Let's go.
