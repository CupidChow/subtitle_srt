Just then,

18
00:01:46,560 --> 00:01:47,440
I stood out

19
00:01:47,440 --> 00:01:48,680
and pushed Jiang Yimian behind me.

20
00:01:49,840 --> 00:01:50,760
I told my dad

21
00:01:51,600 --> 00:01:52,600
that I was the one
who sold these things.

22
00:01:52,920 --> 00:01:54,040
I operated the kiosk.

23
00:01:54,040 --> 00:01:55,920
If he wants to punish us,
he can punish me alone.

24
00:02:00,320 --> 00:02:02,200
But, I reflected on my mistakes.

25
00:02:02,200 --> 00:02:03,600
I decided to divert
my passion for business

26
00:02:03,600 --> 00:02:05,000
to studying.

27
00:02:05,920 --> 00:02:06,680
Good morning, dad.

28
00:02:09,480 --> 00:02:11,000
You're smart.

29
00:02:11,440 --> 00:02:12,560
Take this.

30
00:02:14,160 --> 00:02:15,080
Which kiosk

31
00:02:15,080 --> 00:02:15,880
did you confiscate?

32
00:02:16,520 --> 00:02:18,000
These things are
more expensive than the things I sell.

33
00:02:18,440 --> 00:02:19,240
You must punish them.

34
00:02:19,240 --> 00:02:19,880
Punish them severely.

35
00:02:21,320 --> 00:02:22,480
I bought these.

36
00:02:26,160 --> 00:02:27,400
Coffee, Red Bull, Yakult,

37
00:02:27,400 --> 00:02:28,920
peanuts, red dates and walnuts.

38
00:02:28,920 --> 00:02:29,600
Come on, these are on Mr. Xie.

39
00:02:29,600 --> 00:02:30,040
Everyone can eat these.

40
00:02:30,040 --> 00:02:30,680
Help yourselves.

41
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:33,000
- Thank you, Mr. Xie.
- Thank you, Mr. Xie.

42
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:34,160
You're welcome.

43
00:02:34,160 --> 00:02:35,560
You can thank my son.

44
00:02:35,560 --> 00:02:36,680
I bought these

45
00:02:36,680 --> 00:02:37,680
with his next month's pocket money.

46
00:02:39,920 --> 00:02:41,320
How could you use my money

47
00:02:41,320 --> 00:02:42,520
to treat others?

48
00:02:42,520 --> 00:02:43,920
This is known as setting an example.

49
00:02:43,920 --> 00:02:45,080
They'd know

50
00:02:45,080 --> 00:02:46,520
the consequences of
speculative buying and selling.

51
00:02:47,800 --> 00:02:48,960
Stop laughing.

52
00:02:48,960 --> 00:02:50,120
Setting an example.

53
00:02:50,120 --> 00:02:51,160
You're that monkey.

54
00:02:51,160 --> 00:02:51,920
That's enough.

55
00:02:51,920 --> 00:02:53,320
Enjoy the snacks quietly

56
00:02:53,320 --> 00:02:54,440
and listen to me.

57
00:02:54,800 --> 00:02:57,280
A lot of students have registered

58
00:02:57,280 --> 00:02:59,840
for the university winter camp program,

59
00:02:59,840 --> 00:03:02,240
especially for Jinghua University.

60
00:03:02,640 --> 00:03:04,000
However, there are
limited slots available.

61
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:05,680
By conventions,

62
00:03:05,680 --> 00:03:06,480
the school

63
00:03:06,480 --> 00:03:08,400
will hold an exam
at the end of this month.

64
00:03:08,400 --> 00:03:10,320
You will be ranked
according to your results.

65
00:03:10,320 --> 00:03:11,840
Selection of students
will be based on the rankings too.

66
00:03:11,840 --> 00:03:12,360
Alright.

67
00:03:12,680 --> 00:03:14,400
If you have any queries,
feel free to ask me now.

68
00:03:17,160 --> 00:03:17,800
Sir.

69
00:03:18,480 --> 00:03:19,640
I have two questions.

70
00:03:19,640 --> 00:03:20,200
Go on.

71
00:03:20,480 --> 00:03:21,920
How many slots are there

72
00:03:21,920 --> 00:03:24,320
for the winter camp program?

73
00:03:25,760 --> 00:03:27,000
Following the ratio,

74
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:30,360
about one to three slots.

75
00:03:32,839 --> 00:03:35,975
(Jinghua University Winter Camp
Program Registration Form)

76
00:03:43,160 --> 00:03:44,080
Am I the only one

77
00:03:44,360 --> 00:03:45,560
who registered for the exam?

78
00:03:46,360 --> 00:03:47,160
That is

79
00:03:47,160 --> 00:03:47,800
for certain.

80
00:03:48,560 --> 00:03:50,320
Why didn't you register, Ji Junxing?

81
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:52,120
I plan to fight for
a guaranteed admission slot

82
00:03:52,120 --> 00:03:53,160
in the provincial team.

83
00:03:53,480 --> 00:03:55,080
I think it's more suitable for me.

84
00:03:57,920 --> 00:03:59,080
What about you, Chen Mo?

85
00:03:59,800 --> 00:04:00,480
That's right.

86
00:04:00,480 --> 00:04:02,800
You can get admitted to
Jinghua University with plain marks.

87
00:04:04,640 --> 00:04:06,480
Didn't you say that I can
get admitted with plain marks?

88
00:04:06,800 --> 00:04:07,960
If I want to join the university,

89
00:04:07,960 --> 00:04:09,000
I can do so later.

90
00:04:10,160 --> 00:04:10,920
Fine.

91
00:04:12,440 --> 00:04:13,680
Looks like there are two factions

92
00:04:13,680 --> 00:04:14,840
among our East Gate Squad.

93
00:04:15,480 --> 00:04:17,800
Ace student,
rogue student, and prodigy student.

94
00:04:18,080 --> 00:04:20,840
Slow student, underachieving student,
and weak student.

95
00:04:23,800 --> 00:04:26,280
As a slow student, I'm so lost.

96
00:04:26,920 --> 00:04:28,360
I don't know
what I should do in the future.

97
00:04:29,640 --> 00:04:30,880
The uncertainty of life

98
00:04:30,880 --> 00:04:31,840
is just like a blind box.

99
00:04:32,360 --> 00:04:33,280
You will never know

100
00:04:33,280 --> 00:04:34,880
what will unfold next.

101
00:04:35,160 --> 00:04:37,040
It's like this steamed stuffed bun.

102
00:04:37,440 --> 00:04:38,400
Before you bite into it,

103
00:04:38,400 --> 00:04:39,400
you won't know what's in it.

104
00:04:39,840 --> 00:04:40,440
Have a taste.

105
00:04:45,360 --> 00:04:46,160
It's pickled vegetable.

106
00:05:02,920 --> 00:05:03,880
Why are you cutting the queue?

107
00:05:06,480 --> 00:05:07,720

at double speed recently.

International Olympiad in Informatics,

110

we'll start our intensive training
from today onwards.

111

I won't be joining the evening classes.

112
00:05:25,720 --> 00:05:27,280
You'll have to spend
the whole evening training.

What about your academic subjects?

Please help me with it.

115
00:05:30,360 --> 00:05:32,240
We should always
be eager and not ashamed to learn.

a father for a lifetime.

Seriously,

119
00:05:43,760 --> 00:05:45,120
if we both get admitted,

120
00:05:45,520 --> 00:05:47,120
does it mean that we can
go to Jinghua University together?

Yes.

your answers

are really eye-opening.

focus on composition writing today.

132

The title of the essay is

133
00:06:25,400 --> 00:06:26,680
to write about the beauty of something.

134
00:06:27,040 --> 00:06:28,920
There's an extraordinary student

the beauty of Euler's formula.

Where's Ji Junxing?

He's not here, sir.

The Euler's formula

00:06:50,600 --> 00:06:52,840
is the most perfect
mathematical formula.

145
00:06:53,160 --> 00:06:54,720
It has two transcendental numbers.

146

E as the base of the Natural Logarithms,

147

and Pi, π.

the God's Formula.

155

156

Stop.

157

Mr. Wu used your essay

170
00:07:43,960 --> 00:07:44,880
as a bad example.

171
00:07:45,240 --> 00:07:46,920
He said that it's his first time

172
00:07:47,200 --> 00:07:47,640
encountering

173
00:07:47,640 --> 00:07:49,240
a student who wrote about
mathematical formula in an essay.

174
00:07:50,240 --> 00:07:52,160
I think that
mathematical formula is beautiful.

175
00:07:53,120 --> 00:07:54,760
Well, it's okay if you write about it.

176
00:07:54,760 --> 00:07:56,280
But at least you have
to reach the word count.

177
00:07:56,560 --> 00:07:57,960
I can finish it within 300 words.

178
00:07:57,960 --> 00:07:59,200
Why should I drag it to 800 words?

179
00:07:59,200 --> 00:08:00,160
Isn't that a waste?

180
00:08:00,600 --> 00:08:01,440
Duh!

181
00:08:01,720 --> 00:08:02,640
You handed in your paper early

182
00:08:02,640 --> 00:08:03,720
as you wanted to join the training.

183
00:08:05,080 --> 00:08:06,400
Let's not talk about your essay.

184
00:08:06,400 --> 00:08:08,560
One's knowledge equals to five cartloads
of books means someone is well-educated.

185
00:08:08,560 --> 00:08:09,600
Don't you know that?

186
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:11,160
I do know

187
00:08:11,160 --> 00:08:12,760
that a horse can carry 200 kg of weight,

188
00:08:12,760 --> 00:08:14,160
and so five horses
can carry 1 ton of weight.

189
00:08:14,640 --> 00:08:16,720
If we convert it into cubic meters,

190
00:08:16,720 --> 00:08:18,160
0.4 cubic meter

191
00:08:18,440 --> 00:08:20,400
can produce 10, 000 bamboo slips,

192
00:08:20,720 --> 00:08:21,640
which equal to 320, 000 words.

193
00:08:22,120 --> 00:08:23,320
It's not even as thick as
one Xinhua Dictionary.

194
00:08:23,680 --> 00:08:24,960
Hence, one's knowledge
equals to five cartloads of books

195
00:08:24,960 --> 00:08:26,560
cannot signify that one is
well-educated anymore.

196
00:08:27,240 --> 00:08:28,120
Lin Xi.

197
00:08:28,600 --> 00:08:30,120
As a high school student,

198
00:08:30,120 --> 00:08:31,440
your knowledge is equal to 500 cartloads
of books.

199
00:08:32,160 --> 00:08:33,040
Ji Junxing.

200
00:08:33,320 --> 00:08:34,640
I know that you're good at mathematics,

201
00:08:35,160 --> 00:08:36,840
but this is a language subject.

202
00:08:37,840 --> 00:08:39,480
Language enriches the world.

203
00:08:39,480 --> 00:08:40,960
Mathematics simplifies the world.

204
00:08:41,480 --> 00:08:43,760
If life is just like mathematics,

205
00:08:43,760 --> 00:08:44,840
in which there's an answer

206
00:08:44,840 --> 00:08:46,280
behind every question,

207
00:08:46,880 --> 00:08:47,560
ambiguous

208
00:08:47,560 --> 00:08:49,000
reading comprehension wouldn't exist.

209
00:08:49,360 --> 00:08:50,360
Isn't that wonderful?

210
00:08:51,360 --> 00:08:52,120
Well.

211
00:08:53,600 --> 00:08:55,640
If you finish all these homework,

212
00:08:55,640 --> 00:08:57,000
your scores would be more wonderful.

213
00:08:57,440 --> 00:08:58,400
Alright.

214
00:08:59,520 --> 00:09:00,320
Do it.

215
00:09:14,320 --> 00:09:15,360
Don't forget to do your homework.

216
00:09:15,640 --> 00:09:16,880
A set of papers each for
Chinese and English.

217
00:09:16,880 --> 00:09:17,920
Two sets of papers for Science subjects.

218
00:09:17,920 --> 00:09:19,280
Mathematics test paper survey

219
00:09:19,280 --> 00:09:19,640
and...

220
00:09:19,640 --> 00:09:20,200
I got it.

221
00:09:20,200 --> 00:09:21,880
And the National College Entrance
Examination Trial Papers.

222
00:09:22,120 --> 00:09:23,000
I'll do it tonight.

223
00:09:23,240 --> 00:09:23,960
It's already late.

224
00:09:23,960 --> 00:09:24,880
Don't you need to sleep?

225
00:09:24,880 --> 00:09:25,880
You can do it during the weekend.

226
00:09:25,880 --> 00:09:26,880
I don't have time.

227
00:09:27,720 --> 00:09:28,680
I have training on weekends.

228
00:09:29,160 --> 00:09:30,320
Your provincial team is really busy.

229
00:09:30,320 --> 00:09:31,280
You even have trainings on weekends.

230
00:09:31,680 --> 00:09:33,160
My life is all about

231
00:09:33,160 --> 00:09:33,920
programming now.

232
00:09:34,200 --> 00:09:35,600
I type so furiously
until my keyboard is on fire.

233
00:09:38,240 --> 00:09:38,760
Okay.

234
00:09:42,760 --> 00:09:43,560
Hey, watch it!

235
00:09:43,560 --> 00:09:44,360
It's okay.

236
00:09:45,400 --> 00:09:46,440
We're used to it.

237
00:09:46,960 --> 00:09:48,040
She's focused solely on studying.

238
00:09:49,120 --> 00:09:50,680
We're just NPCs to her.

239
00:09:53,280 --> 00:09:53,920
Are you okay?

240
00:09:53,920 --> 00:09:54,840
No worries.

241
00:09:55,160 --> 00:09:55,720
Here you go.

242
00:09:56,120 --> 00:09:56,760
I'm leaving.

243
00:09:58,000 --> 00:09:59,200
Goodbye.

244
00:10:13,640 --> 00:10:14,560
I'm sorry

245
00:10:15,080 --> 00:10:15,880
that I'm late.

246
00:10:17,240 --> 00:10:18,120
It's alright.

247
00:10:19,840 --> 00:10:20,600
Are you hungry?

248
00:10:21,640 --> 00:10:23,280
I've ordered some fries,

249
00:10:23,280 --> 00:10:24,160
fried fantail shrimps,

250
00:10:24,160 --> 00:10:24,720
cake,

251
00:10:24,720 --> 00:10:25,600
and salad for you.

252
00:10:26,240 --> 00:10:27,160
This is your fried chicken wings.

253
00:10:27,600 --> 00:10:28,720
Oh, there are fried chicken wings too.

254
00:10:29,920 --> 00:10:30,920
What else do you want to eat?

255
00:10:30,920 --> 00:10:31,640
Order whatever you want.

256
00:10:32,520 --> 00:10:34,720
Why are you so generous today?

257
00:10:35,960 --> 00:10:36,800
Well.

258
00:10:37,120 --> 00:10:38,160
You lost your pocket money

259
00:10:38,160 --> 00:10:39,400
due to the kiosk.

260
00:10:39,720 --> 00:10:41,000
I'm your business partner.

261
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:42,360
I can't let you starve.

262
00:10:44,680 --> 00:10:46,960
Are you the Jiang Yimian I know?

263
00:10:48,560 --> 00:10:49,720
I only realize that you're

264
00:10:50,120 --> 00:10:50,960
this gentle.

265
00:10:51,440 --> 00:10:52,560
You're good too.

266
00:10:52,960 --> 00:10:54,560
You look like a fool

267
00:10:54,560 --> 00:10:55,720
that needs a beating normally.

268
00:10:56,480 --> 00:10:58,080
But when you were doing the accounts,

269
00:10:58,320 --> 00:11:00,040
you looked rather handsome

270
00:11:00,840 --> 00:11:01,920
for a few seconds.

271
00:11:02,760 --> 00:11:04,160
I didn't tell you this.

272
00:11:04,160 --> 00:11:04,920
Actually, I really admire

273
00:11:04,920 --> 00:11:06,400
those who are good at mathematics.

274
00:11:06,760 --> 00:11:08,640
You found my forte at last.

275
00:11:09,840 --> 00:11:10,960
So,

276
00:11:11,200 --> 00:11:14,440
could we develop

277
00:11:15,280 --> 00:11:16,440
our relationship further?

278
00:11:20,880 --> 00:11:22,640
This is so sudden.

279
00:11:22,640 --> 00:11:23,600
Please let me think about this.

280
00:11:26,840 --> 00:11:27,760
Okay.

281
00:11:28,160 --> 00:11:28,880
Go on.

282
00:11:29,320 --> 00:11:30,000
Please

283
00:11:31,240 --> 00:11:32,240
help me with my mathematics.

284
00:11:36,400 --> 00:11:38,240
Why do you suddenly
want to go to Jingzhou?

285
00:11:39,120 --> 00:11:40,240
Jingzhou is really nice.

286
00:11:40,560 --> 00:11:41,480
Let's talk about the food there.

287
00:11:41,720 --> 00:11:43,360
Drink a bowl of Douzhi for breakfast.

288
00:11:43,360 --> 00:11:44,680
Have a bowl of
bittern flapjack for lunch.

289
00:11:45,040 --> 00:11:46,400
Then, enjoy instant-boiled
mutton in the evening.

290
00:11:46,800 --> 00:11:47,760
How lovely is that!

291
00:11:48,440 --> 00:11:49,880
Can you adapt to the Northern cuisine?

292
00:11:50,400 --> 00:11:51,040
Of course.

293
00:11:51,040 --> 00:11:52,520
I'm an all-inclusive foodie.

294
00:11:53,160 --> 00:11:54,400
Food is not the main point here.

295
00:11:54,760 --> 00:11:55,920
Bin said

296
00:11:55,920 --> 00:11:58,000
the best art festival
and music festival

297
00:11:58,000 --> 00:11:59,280
are held at Jingzhou.

298
00:11:59,680 --> 00:12:01,040
Who's Bin?

299
00:12:01,440 --> 00:12:03,000
He's my brother. He's really nice.

300
00:12:04,240 --> 00:12:05,200
Why didn't I know

301
00:12:05,200 --> 00:12:06,480
that you have a brother in Jingzhou?

302
00:12:06,840 --> 00:12:07,840
What kind of brother is he?

303
00:12:08,240 --> 00:12:09,080
Is he

304
00:12:09,280 --> 00:12:10,480
your biological brother?

305
00:12:10,480 --> 00:12:11,360
No.

306
00:12:11,360 --> 00:12:12,600
He was my neighbor when I was little.

307
00:12:12,600 --> 00:12:13,480
He moved.

308
00:12:13,720 --> 00:12:15,200
We reconnected a few days ago.

309
00:12:15,640 --> 00:12:16,760
That's really unexpected.

310
00:12:16,760 --> 00:12:18,320
He used to be a crybaby.

311
00:12:18,640 --> 00:12:21,440
Now, he's a mature gentleman.

312
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:22,720
Are you going to

313
00:12:22,720 --> 00:12:23,840
Jingzhou due to him?

314
00:12:23,840 --> 00:12:24,440
Yes.

315
00:12:24,760 --> 00:12:26,600
He's the student council
president of Jinghang University.

316
00:12:26,600 --> 00:12:27,360
If I go,

317
00:12:27,360 --> 00:12:28,520
I can clown around in university.

318
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:31,080
Are you a clown?

319
00:12:31,440 --> 00:12:32,360
Besides,

320
00:12:32,360 --> 00:12:33,600
can you get admitted
to Jinghang University?

321
00:12:34,240 --> 00:12:36,000
Well, I have your help.

322
00:12:36,440 --> 00:12:37,400
I did my calculations.

323
00:12:37,400 --> 00:12:39,880
As long as I score
extra 40 marks for mathematics,

324
00:12:40,160 --> 00:12:41,440
there won't be any problem.

325
00:12:41,960 --> 00:12:43,800
You're willing to
learn mathematics for him?

326
00:12:44,880 --> 00:12:46,280
Do you like him?

327
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:53,280
Well.

328
00:12:53,640 --> 00:12:55,240
It's possible too.

329
00:12:56,800 --> 00:12:58,360
Ask him to help you
with your mathematics then.

330
00:12:58,360 --> 00:12:59,320
Why are you asking for my help?

331
00:13:02,400 --> 00:13:03,840
If you don't want
to help me, just say it.

332
00:13:04,640 --> 00:13:06,000
You're so ridiculous.

333
00:13:14,160 --> 00:13:15,240
I'm back.

334
00:13:21,880 --> 00:13:22,560
Well.

335
00:13:22,560 --> 00:13:23,840
Did you buy a new keyboard?

336
00:13:25,480 --> 00:13:27,480
Look at its quality and glow.

337
00:13:27,480 --> 00:13:28,720
Did you get this for Ji Junxing?

338
00:13:30,400 --> 00:13:31,680
I bought him a new keyboard

339
00:13:31,680 --> 00:13:33,480
to wish him all the best

340
00:13:33,480 --> 00:13:34,680
in the International
Olympiad in Informatics.

341
00:13:35,680 --> 00:13:37,480
You've grown so much closer

342
00:13:37,480 --> 00:13:39,720
ever since you're in your senior year.

343
00:13:40,560 --> 00:13:42,280
That's known as like-minded friends.

344
00:13:43,680 --> 00:13:44,680
How lovely!

345
00:13:45,160 --> 00:13:46,480
I want to get admitted
to the same university

346
00:13:46,480 --> 00:13:47,760
as the person I like too.

347
00:13:51,280 --> 00:13:51,920
What did you say?

348
00:13:52,400 --> 00:13:53,640
Do you have a crush?

349
00:13:56,040 --> 00:13:56,800
No.

350
00:13:56,800 --> 00:13:57,680
You heard me wrong.

351
00:13:58,040 --> 00:13:59,520
Well, Jiang Yimian.

352
00:13:59,520 --> 00:14:01,240
You're keeping secrets from me.

353
00:14:01,240 --> 00:14:02,120
Be honest with me. Who is that?

354
00:14:02,840 --> 00:14:03,720
Who?

355
00:14:04,720 --> 00:14:05,680
You're so annoying!

356
00:14:06,200 --> 00:14:07,720
If you're not studying,
I still want to study.

357
00:14:40,143 --> 00:14:41,174
(International Olympiad in Informatics
Shortlist. Class 1 Grade 12, Ji Junxing)

358
00:14:42,560 --> 00:14:43,680
I saw my name.

359
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:47,280
(Lin Xi)

360
00:14:48,160 --> 00:14:49,360
I saw my name too.

361
00:14:49,600 --> 00:14:50,880
We can go to Jingzhou together.

362
00:14:52,080 --> 00:14:53,920
I'll bring you to try the bittern
flapjack and roasted duck.

363
00:14:54,760 --> 00:14:55,480
You promise?

364
00:14:56,440 --> 00:14:57,160
I promise.

365
00:14:58,920 --> 00:15:00,080
Lin Xi and Ji Junxing.

366
00:15:00,600 --> 00:15:02,120
Mr. Xie wants to see you both.

367
00:15:09,480 --> 00:15:10,200
Mr. Xie.

368
00:15:10,480 --> 00:15:12,240
What are the standards of the selection?

369
00:15:12,600 --> 00:15:13,640
They're in a relationship.

370
00:15:13,640 --> 00:15:14,880
If a flawed student like her can join,

371
00:15:14,880 --> 00:15:16,400
why couldn't my daughter join?

372
00:15:18,160 --> 00:15:18,800
Come in.

373
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:25,160
Look, the students are here.

374
00:15:25,840 --> 00:15:26,840
Please calm down.

375
00:15:27,240 --> 00:15:28,200
Let's

376
00:15:28,200 --> 00:15:30,840
not jump into conclusions.

377
00:15:31,920 --> 00:15:33,920
Lin Xi, and Ji Junxing.

378
00:15:34,640 --> 00:15:35,800
A student reported

379
00:15:36,040 --> 00:15:37,120
that you're dating each other.

380
00:15:37,440 --> 00:15:38,280
I asked you over

381
00:15:38,280 --> 00:15:40,680
to learn more about the situation

382
00:15:40,680 --> 00:15:42,400
as well as to
avoid any misunderstanding.

383
00:15:43,280 --> 00:15:45,400
I don't mind what others think, sir.

384
00:15:45,400 --> 00:15:46,240
But we're just good friends.

385
00:15:46,240 --> 00:15:47,080
We're not dating.

386
00:15:47,720 --> 00:15:48,680
What an excuse!

387
00:15:49,280 --> 00:15:50,520
Say it, Liu Yin.

388
00:15:50,840 --> 00:15:51,720
Does she

389
00:15:51,720 --> 00:15:53,200
come back to the dorm late at night?

390
00:16:00,160 --> 00:16:00,880
Yes.

391
00:16:01,200 --> 00:16:03,160
She always comes back after lights out.

392
00:16:03,640 --> 00:16:04,920
We were studying.

393
00:16:05,920 --> 00:16:06,960
Studying?

394
00:16:06,960 --> 00:16:08,280
Who can prove that?

395
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:10,320
How can we prove that?

396
00:16:10,920 --> 00:16:12,600
Do we need to prove
to the teachers or our parents

397
00:16:12,600 --> 00:16:14,240
how hardworking we are?

398
00:16:15,480 --> 00:16:16,800
Seems like you won't admit it

399
00:16:16,800 --> 00:16:18,000
unless I show you the evidence.

400
00:16:27,200 --> 00:16:28,560
How dare you take my stuff!

401
00:16:29,120 --> 00:16:30,280
You're feeling guilty, aren't you?

402
00:16:31,720 --> 00:16:32,400
Lin Xi.

403
00:16:33,480 --> 00:16:34,600
What is this?

404
00:16:35,280 --> 00:16:36,760
Ji Junxing is having a competition soon.

405
00:16:36,760 --> 00:16:38,200
I'm gifting him a keyboard
as a token of encouragement.

406
00:16:40,400 --> 00:16:41,120
Mr. Xie.

407
00:16:41,520 --> 00:16:43,080
This keyboard isn't cheap.

408
00:16:43,840 --> 00:16:44,480
If they're just friends,

409
00:16:44,480 --> 00:16:45,800
why would she give him
such a pricey gift?

410
00:16:46,240 --> 00:16:47,600
You like him.

411
00:16:48,960 --> 00:16:50,400
Does gifting me a keyboard
mean that she likes me?

412
00:16:50,840 --> 00:16:52,920
If that's the case,

413
00:16:53,080 --> 00:16:55,200
people back then are dating if they
gift each other willow as goodbye gift.

414
00:16:55,520 --> 00:16:57,080
Students like their teachers

415
00:16:57,080 --> 00:16:58,360
if they send teachers gift
on Teachers' Day.

416
00:16:59,120 --> 00:17:00,200
Stop talking about

417
00:17:00,200 --> 00:17:01,600
nonsense here.

418
00:17:01,600 --> 00:17:02,800
Why didn't she give it to someone else

419
00:17:02,800 --> 00:17:03,920
instead of you?

420
00:17:04,200 --> 00:17:05,080
In your eyes,

421
00:17:05,400 --> 00:17:05,960
is there only

422
00:17:05,960 --> 00:17:07,320
romantic relationship
between male and female?

423
00:17:07,720 --> 00:17:09,240
Is there no such thing as

424
00:17:09,240 --> 00:17:10,680
like-minded friendship

425
00:17:10,680 --> 00:17:11,920
between male and female?

426
00:17:13,640 --> 00:17:15,000
What's the purpose of school then?

427
00:17:15,320 --> 00:17:16,480
Producing robots that can only study?

428
00:17:16,480 --> 00:17:17,640
Aside from your relationship,

429
00:17:20,880 --> 00:17:21,560
did you consider

430
00:17:21,560 --> 00:17:22,720
about other's feeling then?

431
00:17:24,520 --> 00:17:25,960
Based on what you said,

432
00:17:25,960 --> 00:17:27,600
I only return after lights out.

433
00:17:27,600 --> 00:17:28,240
I'm not even there.

434
00:17:28,240 --> 00:17:29,240
How could I affect you?

435
00:17:31,080 --> 00:17:32,760
You're not selected for
the winter camp program.

436
00:17:32,760 --> 00:17:33,840
So, you're jealous
and try to sabotage others.

437
00:17:34,480 --> 00:17:36,360
If you got chosen due to this,

438
00:17:36,360 --> 00:17:37,240
won't you feel ashamed?

439
00:17:51,920 --> 00:17:52,600
You're really incredible.

440
00:17:53,040 --> 00:17:53,880
You're smooth-tongued.

441
00:17:54,360 --> 00:17:55,960
They've gone too far.

442
00:17:56,400 --> 00:17:58,040
How could they
take my stuff and tell on me!

443
00:17:59,400 --> 00:18:00,280
Well.

444
00:18:00,800 --> 00:18:02,160
Can you give it
to its rightful owner now?

445
00:18:09,160 --> 00:18:10,520
Thank goodness it's not broken.

446
00:18:10,520 --> 00:18:11,080
Here you go.

447
00:18:12,400 --> 00:18:14,160
I hope that you'd think of me

448
00:18:14,160 --> 00:18:15,320
whenever you use it.

449
00:18:17,360 --> 00:18:18,040
Okay.

450
00:18:19,520 --> 00:18:20,280
Moreover,

451
00:18:21,760 --> 00:18:22,760
Mrs. Liu.

452
00:18:25,360 --> 00:18:26,920
Is it too late to return it now?

453
00:18:26,920 --> 00:18:27,640
It's too late.

454
00:18:28,120 --> 00:18:29,360
Goods sold are not refundable.

455
00:18:30,080 --> 00:18:32,680
- Not refundable.
- Not refundable.

456
00:18:32,680 --> 00:18:34,440
When were you here?

457
00:18:35,720 --> 00:18:36,640
What's that?

458
00:18:36,640 --> 00:18:37,360
What?

459
00:18:37,360 --> 00:18:39,040
Why are you here?

460
00:18:41,480 --> 00:18:42,800
Wireless keyboard.

461
00:18:45,920 --> 00:18:47,040
Congratulations, Lin Xi and Ji Junxing,

462
00:18:47,040 --> 00:18:49,080
for progressing
towards Jinghua University.

463
00:18:49,080 --> 00:18:50,200
- Cheers!
- Cheers!

464
00:18:54,320 --> 00:18:55,720
This is one small step
for the both of you,

465
00:18:55,720 --> 00:18:57,200
but it's one giant leap for mankind.

466
00:18:57,520 --> 00:18:58,240
Seriously.

467
00:18:58,240 --> 00:18:59,400
As if we're going to the moon.

468
00:19:00,480 --> 00:19:01,960
Are you going to Jingzhou together?

469
00:19:02,960 --> 00:19:04,080
I'll bring you good food when I return.

470
00:19:04,440 --> 00:19:05,280
I want roasted duck.

471
00:19:05,680 --> 00:19:06,480
I want Daoxiangcun snacks.

472
00:19:06,480 --> 00:19:07,760
Jingzhou's Erguotou is fine too.

473
00:19:07,760 --> 00:19:08,440
Sure.

474
00:19:08,440 --> 00:19:09,280
What about you, Chen Mo?

475
00:19:09,560 --> 00:19:10,680
Have you come of age?

476
00:19:10,680 --> 00:19:11,440
In your dreams.

477
00:19:13,880 --> 00:19:15,040
Do you want anything, Mianmian?

478
00:19:16,440 --> 00:19:17,840
I don't need anything.

479
00:19:18,200 --> 00:19:19,080
I'm going

480
00:19:19,080 --> 00:19:20,360
to Jingzhou as well during winter break.

481
00:19:20,520 --> 00:19:21,920
Why are you going to Jingzhou?

482
00:19:21,920 --> 00:19:23,480
I'm going to visit a relative.

483
00:19:23,480 --> 00:19:23,920
When is it?

484
00:19:23,920 --> 00:19:24,800
We can go together.

485
00:19:25,080 --> 00:19:26,000
It's not confirmed yet.

486
00:19:27,480 --> 00:19:28,280
I disagree.

487
00:19:29,360 --> 00:19:31,040
I don't care about your opinion.

488
00:19:31,040 --> 00:19:32,160
You're not that important.

489
00:19:32,440 --> 00:19:33,120
I'm free

490
00:19:33,120 --> 00:19:34,080
to go wherever I want.

491
00:19:34,440 --> 00:19:35,560
What about your safety?

492
00:19:35,960 --> 00:19:37,040
What if you meet some bad guys,

493
00:19:37,040 --> 00:19:37,960
thieves

494
00:19:38,240 --> 00:19:39,120
or a lunatic stalker?

495
00:19:39,120 --> 00:19:40,400
You're exaggerating.

496
00:19:40,400 --> 00:19:41,440
It's a lawful society.

497
00:19:41,440 --> 00:19:42,680
Besides, it's Jingzhou.

498
00:19:42,680 --> 00:19:44,080
It's not a remote place.

499
00:19:44,080 --> 00:19:45,000
You can't be too sure.

500
00:19:45,320 --> 00:19:46,520
She's so clumsy.

501
00:19:46,520 --> 00:19:48,160
She might lose her wallet
as soon as she boards the bus.

502
00:19:48,160 --> 00:19:49,400
If she's unlucky,

503
00:19:49,680 --> 00:19:50,200
she might board an illegal taxi.

504
00:19:50,200 --> 00:19:50,880
Oh, pooh!

505
00:19:51,240 --> 00:19:52,560
Can't you think of something positive?

506
00:19:53,040 --> 00:19:54,240
I'm just concerned about you.

507
00:19:54,560 --> 00:19:55,320
If you're concerned,

508
00:19:55,320 --> 00:19:56,880
pay me back my money for the kiosk.

509
00:19:56,880 --> 00:19:58,680
I lent you 200 yuan previously.

510
00:20:00,560 --> 00:20:01,320
I'll pay you back then.

511
00:20:01,320 --> 00:20:02,200
We're all clear.

512
00:20:03,120 --> 00:20:04,360
Fine then.

513
00:20:04,360 --> 00:20:05,400
How ridiculous!

514
00:20:20,320 --> 00:20:21,560
Lin Xi.

515
00:20:21,560 --> 00:20:22,360
I just got off the bus.

516
00:20:22,360 --> 00:20:23,720
I'll see you later.

517
00:20:24,160 --> 00:20:25,280
Fortunately, Ji Junxing and you

518
00:20:25,280 --> 00:20:26,760
arrived two days earlier.

519
00:20:27,120 --> 00:20:28,240
I didn't expect

520
00:20:28,240 --> 00:20:29,800
Jingzhou to be this chilly.

521
00:20:31,800 --> 00:20:33,280
(Don't be too immersed in the call.)

522
00:20:33,280 --> 00:20:34,840
(Be mindful of your belongings too.)

523
00:20:35,560 --> 00:20:36,360
Don't worry.

524
00:20:36,360 --> 00:20:37,560
I'll never leave without my bags.

525
00:20:37,560 --> 00:20:38,320
Besides,

526
00:20:38,320 --> 00:20:39,840
there aren't many bad guys out here.

527
00:20:51,560 --> 00:20:52,480
What are you doing here?

528
00:20:53,320 --> 00:20:54,680
How did you recognize me?

529
00:20:55,160 --> 00:20:56,640
Even if you're burnt to ashes,

530
00:20:56,920 --> 00:20:58,160
or turn into a puddle of urine,

531
00:20:58,160 --> 00:20:58,960
I can still recognize you.

532
00:21:05,560 --> 00:21:07,720
Where has it gone?

533
00:21:08,560 --> 00:21:09,640
I told you to be mindful.

534
00:21:09,640 --> 00:21:10,680
Look, you lost your wallet.

535
00:21:11,600 --> 00:21:12,920
Well, it's your fault too.

536
00:21:13,240 --> 00:21:14,360
I'm always unlucky when you're around.

537
00:21:14,360 --> 00:21:15,120
Stay away from me.

538
00:21:16,480 --> 00:21:18,680
By the way, why are you in Jingzhou?

539
00:21:20,320 --> 00:21:21,160
I'm here to visit my relative.

540
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:22,600
Also,

541
00:21:22,920 --> 00:21:24,520
mind your words.

542
00:21:25,080 --> 00:21:26,760
Lin Xi and Ji Junxing are occupied.

543
00:21:27,080 --> 00:21:28,120
I'm your only support now.

544
00:21:29,320 --> 00:21:30,160
I don't need your help.

545
00:21:30,800 --> 00:21:31,360
Bin

546
00:21:31,360 --> 00:21:32,840
won't let me end up on the streets.

547
00:21:32,840 --> 00:21:34,080
Bin.

548
00:21:34,840 --> 00:21:35,840
You don't even have a single penny.

549
00:21:35,840 --> 00:21:36,920
How could you find him?

550
00:21:36,920 --> 00:21:37,840
Are you going to fly?

551
00:21:41,680 --> 00:21:42,520
I'll bounce over.

552
00:21:45,320 --> 00:21:46,840
Are you bouncing for real?

553
00:21:47,560 --> 00:21:50,120
Sir, can you drive me
to Jinghang University?

554
00:21:50,120 --> 00:21:51,120
Sure, come on.

555
00:22:10,262 --> 00:22:11,920
(Examiner)

556
00:22:11,920 --> 00:22:12,560
I have one last question.

557
00:22:12,960 --> 00:22:14,360
Why do you want
to study in Jinghua University?

558
00:22:16,480 --> 00:22:17,720
Initially, I wanted to
study in Jinghua University

559
00:22:18,120 --> 00:22:19,560
because

560
00:22:20,080 --> 00:22:21,440
it is my elder brother's dream.

561
00:22:24,080 --> 00:22:25,440
Due to various circumstances,

562
00:22:25,920 --> 00:22:27,120
he couldn't make it here.

563
00:22:28,480 --> 00:22:29,720
But modern medicine

564
00:22:29,960 --> 00:22:31,280
transplanted his heart to another person

565
00:22:31,280 --> 00:22:32,800
and saved that person's life.

566
00:22:34,280 --> 00:22:35,560
I was really touched.

567
00:22:37,440 --> 00:22:38,280
Medical science

568
00:22:38,720 --> 00:22:40,760
might be unable to
bring a dead man back to life,

569
00:22:41,320 --> 00:22:42,480
but it can

570
00:22:42,480 --> 00:22:43,720
bring hope to others.

571
00:22:45,320 --> 00:22:46,880
I want to get admitted
to Jinghua Medical School.

572
00:22:47,200 --> 00:22:48,760
I would like to be a part of that

573
00:22:49,240 --> 00:22:50,600
and contribute my best.

574
00:23:00,395 --> 00:23:02,462
(Academic building)

575
00:23:02,520 --> 00:23:03,280
Are you done?

576
00:23:04,680 --> 00:23:05,800
Are you done with the competition?

577
00:23:06,480 --> 00:23:07,400
How was the competition?

578
00:23:09,240 --> 00:23:10,120
Not very well.

579
00:23:10,720 --> 00:23:12,280
I did poorly too.

580
00:23:16,840 --> 00:23:17,920
I was lying.

581
00:23:17,920 --> 00:23:18,760
Me too.

582
00:23:19,160 --> 00:23:20,200
But when you said

583
00:23:20,200 --> 00:23:21,200
that you didn't do well,

584
00:23:21,200 --> 00:23:22,000
I was shocked

585
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:22,800
for a split second.

586
00:23:23,040 --> 00:23:24,680
Have a cup of milk tea
to settle your nerves.

587
00:23:30,040 --> 00:23:31,840
Jinghua University's milk tea
does taste different.

588
00:23:32,680 --> 00:23:34,840
I bought this
at a random street side shop.

589
00:23:36,200 --> 00:23:39,160
Well, milk tea tastes different

590
00:23:39,160 --> 00:23:40,360
due to the vibes in Jinghua University.

591
00:23:41,360 --> 00:23:42,080
Don't you think

592
00:23:42,080 --> 00:23:42,760
that the trees here

593
00:23:42,760 --> 00:23:44,280
look very educated?

594
00:23:44,920 --> 00:23:45,360
You're right.

595
00:23:45,360 --> 00:23:46,560
The trees look

596
00:23:46,560 --> 00:23:47,800
remarkably fine.

597
00:23:48,520 --> 00:23:50,320
You're happy. That's why.

598
00:23:50,320 --> 00:23:50,920
That's true.

599
00:23:50,920 --> 00:23:52,200
The examination is finally over.

600
00:23:53,080 --> 00:23:53,920
The campus is massive,

601
00:23:53,920 --> 00:23:55,320
yet we didn't get to explore it much.

602
00:23:55,320 --> 00:23:55,960
Come on.

603
00:23:55,960 --> 00:23:56,560
Let's experience

604
00:23:56,560 --> 00:23:57,800
the cultural vibes in the top campus.

605
00:23:57,800 --> 00:23:58,240
Come on.

606
00:23:59,360 --> 00:23:59,800
Over there.

607
00:24:03,480 --> 00:24:04,320
Ji Junxing.

608
00:24:04,320 --> 00:24:05,600
Look at the size of the cauliflower.

609
00:24:05,600 --> 00:24:07,080
Is it meticulously measured as well?

610
00:24:08,600 --> 00:24:09,320
Let's have a taste.

611
00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:14,240
It's tastier than
our school canteen's food.

612
00:24:14,240 --> 00:24:15,000
Really?

613
00:24:16,040 --> 00:24:17,040
It's all in the mind.

614
00:24:19,560 --> 00:24:20,520
Let's take a photo together.

615
00:24:23,960 --> 00:24:25,760
A memento of
our Jinghua University canteen visit.

616
00:24:27,960 --> 00:24:29,040
I'll take a photo for you too.

617
00:24:42,120 --> 00:24:43,280
How much is it, sir?

618
00:24:43,280 --> 00:24:43,920
30 yuan.

619
00:24:44,240 --> 00:24:46,440
Please give us a student discount, sir.

620
00:24:46,800 --> 00:24:48,360
I only have 27.5 yuan left.

621
00:24:48,680 --> 00:24:49,880
I'm working since early in the morning.

622
00:24:49,880 --> 00:24:50,880
Yet you're asking for a discount?

623
00:24:51,360 --> 00:24:52,120
Leave.

624
00:24:52,120 --> 00:24:52,760
(Hello.)

625
00:24:53,000 --> 00:24:54,280
Hello, Bin.

626
00:24:55,560 --> 00:24:56,960
Can you guess where I am?

627
00:24:57,560 --> 00:24:58,720
(Aren't you on earth?)

628
00:24:58,720 --> 00:24:59,840
(Where else could you be?)

629
00:25:00,400 --> 00:25:01,920
I'm in your school.

630
00:25:07,280 --> 00:25:08,040
Did you know?

631
00:25:08,440 --> 00:25:09,640
In spring,

632
00:25:09,640 --> 00:25:11,720
the withered
grass field will turn green.

633
00:25:11,720 --> 00:25:13,080
All luxuriant and lush.

634
00:25:13,080 --> 00:25:14,160
It'll be such a magnificent view.

635
00:25:14,960 --> 00:25:16,440
Well, let's visit this place

636
00:25:16,440 --> 00:25:16,960
in spring.

637
00:25:16,960 --> 00:25:18,280
Let's see if it's
as beautiful as you described.

638
00:25:21,200 --> 00:25:22,040
Let's have a seat there.

639
00:25:27,840 --> 00:25:29,640
Feel the breeze
in Jinghua University.

640
00:25:31,560 --> 00:25:32,920
Have a seat. I'll take a photo for you.

641
00:25:38,920 --> 00:25:39,760
Three.

642
00:25:45,760 --> 00:25:46,520
Gosh.

643
00:25:49,040 --> 00:25:50,880
Did we just see
ghosts in broad daylight?

644
00:25:51,200 --> 00:25:52,920
What's wrong with them?

645
00:25:53,280 --> 00:25:55,440
Is it the Night Parade of
One Hundred Demons?

646
00:25:55,440 --> 00:25:57,120
It's still early.
Why would there be a night parade?

647
00:25:58,160 --> 00:25:59,240
Come on. Let's check it out.

648
00:26:15,502 --> 00:26:17,769
(Drama Club.
Gothic-themed Cosplay Event)

649
00:26:19,880 --> 00:26:22,320
Gothic-themed Cosplay Event.

650
00:26:22,320 --> 00:26:23,520
Join us.

651
00:26:24,280 --> 00:26:25,840
This seems fun.

652
00:26:26,160 --> 00:26:27,080
Shall we join?

653
00:26:28,920 --> 00:26:29,960
Aren't you afraid that we'll get caught?

654
00:26:30,760 --> 00:26:31,360
We can enter

655
00:26:31,360 --> 00:26:32,000
and dress up

656
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:32,840
with their props.

657
00:26:32,840 --> 00:26:33,680
Who else could recognize us then?

658
00:26:34,320 --> 00:26:35,200
You're right.

659
00:26:35,680 --> 00:26:36,280
Come on.

660
00:26:37,520 --> 00:26:38,120
Let's go.

661
00:26:58,360 --> 00:26:59,480
They must have entered the theatre.

662
00:27:00,760 --> 00:27:02,120
There's a dressing room.

663
00:27:02,120 --> 00:27:03,800
Let's do some makeup before entering.

664
00:27:09,680 --> 00:27:11,160
Black and White Impermanence.

665
00:27:17,360 --> 00:27:18,920
Lend me a hand with this, Ji Junxing.

666
00:27:27,080 --> 00:27:28,640
I'll take your life!

667
00:27:30,560 --> 00:27:31,600
Does your neck

668
00:27:31,600 --> 00:27:32,680
taste like five-spice powder

669
00:27:32,680 --> 00:27:33,800
or spicy flavor?

670
00:27:33,800 --> 00:27:36,360
My neck tastes like Tiramisu.

671
00:27:37,680 --> 00:27:39,080
It's a sweet neck.

672
00:27:39,080 --> 00:27:39,960
Not my favorite.

673
00:27:42,440 --> 00:27:44,520
The cloak from Harry Potter.

674
00:27:44,520 --> 00:27:45,800
And it's a Gryffindor cloak!

675
00:27:47,160 --> 00:27:47,960
Here.

676
00:27:53,440 --> 00:27:54,200
I'll do your makeup.

677
00:27:57,760 --> 00:27:58,320
Shut your eyes.

678
00:28:01,191 --> 00:28:04,604
♪I fall for you♪

679
00:28:04,762 --> 00:28:07,088
♪When I first set my eyes on you♪

Why do you open your eyes?

683
00:28:17,160 --> 00:28:17,920
It's itchy.

684
00:28:19,480 --> 00:28:20,640
Just bear with it for a little longer.

685
00:28:20,880 --> 00:28:21,400
Close your eyes.

Alright.

690
00:28:32,520 --> 00:28:33,440
You look so adorable.

691
00:28:34,640 --> 00:28:36,280
What ghost am I?

692
00:28:36,600 --> 00:28:37,520
A shy ghost?

693
00:28:38,560 --> 00:28:40,200
What ghost is this?

694
00:28:40,960 --> 00:28:42,520
What's with the iron mask?

695
00:28:42,520 --> 00:28:43,560
Isn't it cool?

696
00:28:44,040 --> 00:28:45,040
It's the most handsome ghost

697
00:28:45,040 --> 00:28:46,240
in the medieval period.

698
00:28:47,160 --> 00:28:48,000
You'll surely

699
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:49,320
catch everyone's attention.

700
00:28:50,640 --> 00:28:51,280
Fine.

701
00:28:51,600 --> 00:28:52,640
Let's go and explore around.

702
00:28:52,640 --> 00:28:53,160
Come on.

703
00:29:10,680 --> 00:29:12,160
I thought there's someone there.

704
00:29:12,160 --> 00:29:12,960
How terrifying!

705
00:29:12,960 --> 00:29:13,760
It can move on its own.

706
00:29:16,480 --> 00:29:17,280
Shut up.

707
00:29:19,240 --> 00:29:20,840
There are a lot of masks.

708
00:29:22,920 --> 00:29:24,360
It's free of charge.

709
00:29:24,360 --> 00:29:25,240
Ji Junxing.

710
00:29:29,120 --> 00:29:29,920
What is this?

711
00:29:30,880 --> 00:29:32,000
I'm giving you a thumbs up

712
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:33,520
to congratulate you on your victory.

713
00:29:33,520 --> 00:29:34,440
You're the best.

714
00:29:38,720 --> 00:29:39,600
My fingers are gone.

715
00:29:44,960 --> 00:29:45,920
You need a bite of the brain

716
00:29:45,920 --> 00:29:47,880
to nourish your dying brain cells
after the examination.

717
00:29:47,880 --> 00:29:48,400
Come on.

718
00:29:49,040 --> 00:29:50,360
It looks disgusting.

719
00:29:50,360 --> 00:29:50,800
Come on. Open your mouth.

720
00:29:50,800 --> 00:29:51,680
I'm not eating that.

721
00:29:51,680 --> 00:29:52,240
Hurry up.

722
00:29:55,920 --> 00:29:56,680
How does it taste like?

723
00:29:57,640 --> 00:29:58,560
Not bad.

724
00:29:58,840 --> 00:29:59,840
It's a strawberry-flavored brain.

725
00:30:03,680 --> 00:30:05,080
Eyeballs.

726
00:30:08,520 --> 00:30:09,400
Do you want some eyeballs?

727
00:30:10,040 --> 00:30:11,720
It's slippery and cold.

728
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:13,880
It's a bursting eyeball.

729
00:30:14,240 --> 00:30:15,160
Here, open your mouth.

730
00:30:18,640 --> 00:30:19,320
How is it?

731
00:30:19,880 --> 00:30:21,480
It tastes sweet.

732
00:30:21,760 --> 00:30:23,520
Why is the texture so weird?

733
00:30:23,520 --> 00:30:24,560
It's supposed to be weird.

734
00:30:26,400 --> 00:30:27,240
Meng Po soup.

735
00:30:28,520 --> 00:30:29,440
Why does it look like

736
00:30:29,440 --> 00:30:30,600
the Banlangen Ginger soup my mum made?

737
00:30:32,440 --> 00:30:34,000
It reminds me of
some unpleasant memories.

738
00:30:34,400 --> 00:30:35,720
It tastes better than my mum's soup.

739
00:30:36,440 --> 00:30:37,880
Your taste is really strange.

740
00:30:44,560 --> 00:30:46,520
Which major are you from?

741
00:30:47,280 --> 00:30:48,160
Computer Science.

742
00:30:49,040 --> 00:30:50,240
Computer Science?

743
00:30:50,560 --> 00:30:51,440
Which batch are you from?

744
00:30:51,440 --> 00:30:52,120
- Freshman.
- Sophomore.

745
00:30:54,520 --> 00:30:55,160
- Sophomore.
- Freshman.

746
00:30:56,840 --> 00:30:58,720
Do you need a minute

747
00:30:58,720 --> 00:31:00,600
to match your answers?

748
00:31:00,960 --> 00:31:01,680
It's okay.

749
00:31:01,680 --> 00:31:03,920
We're actually from the next batch.

750
00:31:07,600 --> 00:31:08,480
Nice to meet you, senior.

751
00:31:10,560 --> 00:31:11,520
Well.

752
00:31:11,520 --> 00:31:13,320
We're actually here
for the winter camp program.

753
00:31:13,640 --> 00:31:14,920
We came across
this event at the entrance

754
00:31:14,920 --> 00:31:15,920
and we thought
it's really interesting.

755
00:31:16,240 --> 00:31:17,560
We couldn't help but sneak in.

756
00:31:18,400 --> 00:31:19,240
We can feel

757
00:31:19,240 --> 00:31:20,200
the charm of your club.

758
00:31:20,560 --> 00:31:21,640
We'll study hard,

759
00:31:21,960 --> 00:31:23,240
so we can get admitted.

760
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:25,160
You're rather confident, aren't you?

761
00:31:25,160 --> 00:31:27,080
What's your name?

762
00:31:27,080 --> 00:31:28,040
I'm Ji Junxing.

763
00:31:28,280 --> 00:31:29,160
My name is Lin Xi.

764
00:31:30,880 --> 00:31:32,200
Our Drama Club events next year

765
00:31:32,200 --> 00:31:33,200
will be even more fantastic.

766
00:31:33,200 --> 00:31:35,120
I'll be waiting for you then.

767
00:31:35,120 --> 00:31:37,120
Don't stand me up.

768
00:31:38,840 --> 00:31:39,960
Thank you.

769
00:31:57,560 --> 00:31:59,440
Jinghua University's clubs are fun.

770
00:31:59,440 --> 00:32:00,800
That senior is open-minded too.

771
00:32:01,400 --> 00:32:03,160
I heard that there are
over 200 clubs here.

772
00:32:03,160 --> 00:32:04,560
Each year, the clubs' recruitment event

773
00:32:04,560 --> 00:32:05,920
is like a massive war.

774
00:32:05,920 --> 00:32:06,720
It's really happening.

775
00:32:07,720 --> 00:32:09,240
Let's start a Compliment Club.

776
00:32:09,240 --> 00:32:09,960
I'll be the president

777
00:32:09,960 --> 00:32:11,040
and you can be the vice president.

778
00:32:11,040 --> 00:32:12,920
We'll compliment the students every day

779
00:32:12,920 --> 00:32:14,280
to encourage them.

780
00:32:14,280 --> 00:32:15,080
How about that?

781
00:32:15,080 --> 00:32:15,600
Good.

782
00:32:15,600 --> 00:32:16,400
I know right.

783
00:32:16,840 --> 00:32:17,720
It's so boring.

784
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:18,680
Boring?

785
00:32:18,680 --> 00:32:20,120
You help yourself by helping others too.

786
00:32:25,040 --> 00:32:25,760
Hello.

787
00:32:26,400 --> 00:32:27,520
Lin Xi.

788
00:32:28,720 --> 00:32:30,680
I went to his school.

789
00:32:32,160 --> 00:32:34,560
He has a girlfriend.

790
00:32:37,960 --> 00:32:39,760
(Jinghang University
What? Are you in Jingzhou?)

791
00:32:39,760 --> 00:32:40,320
(Why didn't)

792
00:32:40,320 --> 00:32:41,640
(you inform me about it?)

793
00:32:42,280 --> 00:32:44,400
I wanted to give you a surprise.

794
00:32:44,400 --> 00:32:46,880
Didn't you say that you want
to relive our childhood memories?

795
00:32:46,880 --> 00:32:48,160
I've found a theme park.

796
00:32:48,640 --> 00:32:49,120
When are you free?

797
00:32:49,120 --> 00:32:50,040
(I can't make it today.)

798
00:32:50,040 --> 00:32:51,480
(I have to meet my teacher today.)

799
00:32:52,280 --> 00:32:53,040
What about tomorrow?

800
00:32:53,520 --> 00:32:54,520
I'm afraid I can't make it too.

801
00:32:54,520 --> 00:32:56,240
I have to submit my thesis.

802
00:32:56,600 --> 00:32:57,560
Hello?

803
00:32:57,560 --> 00:32:58,920
The connection is bad here.

804
00:32:58,920 --> 00:32:59,680
I shall hang up first.

805
00:32:59,680 --> 00:33:00,480
Can you hear me?

806
00:33:01,560 --> 00:33:02,160
Who is it?

807
00:33:02,640 --> 00:33:04,480
A girl next door.

808
00:33:04,480 --> 00:33:05,400
She's really clingy.

809
00:33:05,400 --> 00:33:06,920
She's so annoying.

810
00:33:16,160 --> 00:33:16,560
Hello.

811
00:33:16,560 --> 00:33:17,280
What are you doing?

812
00:33:17,480 --> 00:33:18,240
She's fine.

813
00:33:18,560 --> 00:33:19,240
I'm with her.

814
00:33:22,480 --> 00:33:23,480
There's nothing to cry about.

815
00:33:24,520 --> 00:33:26,640
My childhood is gone.

816
00:33:27,520 --> 00:33:29,760
He said he'll bring me
to ride on the carousel

817
00:33:30,080 --> 00:33:32,320
and buy me candied hawthorns.

818
00:33:33,160 --> 00:33:34,000
After three years old,

819
00:33:34,480 --> 00:33:35,160
carousel

820
00:33:35,160 --> 00:33:36,000
is Trojan Horse Virus to me.

821
00:33:36,440 --> 00:33:37,920
You want to spin around, don't you?

822
00:33:38,440 --> 00:33:39,240
I'll help you then.

823
00:33:39,760 --> 00:33:41,120
What are you doing?

824
00:33:41,120 --> 00:33:42,400
Getting your mind straight.

825
00:33:42,800 --> 00:33:45,360
It's none of your business.

826
00:33:45,600 --> 00:33:47,160
Aren't you going to visit your relative?

827
00:33:47,160 --> 00:33:48,240
Go visit your uncle,

828
00:33:48,240 --> 00:33:48,720
aunt,

829
00:33:48,720 --> 00:33:49,760
or distant uncle.

830
00:33:50,200 --> 00:33:51,160
It's my choice to make.

831
00:33:51,440 --> 00:33:52,520
I just want to scold you
back to your senses.

832
00:33:52,960 --> 00:33:54,280
Is it worth crying for such a scum?

833
00:33:54,560 --> 00:33:55,800
You're a fool.

834
00:33:55,800 --> 00:33:57,720
I'm a fool.

835
00:33:58,280 --> 00:34:00,160
No one likes me.

836
00:34:00,400 --> 00:34:01,480
I like you.

840
00:34:12,280 --> 00:34:13,560
Everyone in the East Gate Squad

841
00:34:14,560 --> 00:34:15,520
likes you.

842
00:34:17,840 --> 00:34:18,960
You're not afraid to love or hate.

843
00:34:19,800 --> 00:34:21,320
You strive to be better for your idol.

844
00:34:22,080 --> 00:34:23,160
You're loyal and sincere.

845
00:34:24,680 --> 00:34:25,440
When your friend is in trouble,

846
00:34:25,440 --> 00:34:26,520
you dared to barge into the male toilet.

847
00:34:26,920 --> 00:34:28,080
Moreover, you barged in twice.

848
00:34:29,880 --> 00:34:31,040
You're proactive.

849
00:34:32,200 --> 00:34:33,520
You can travel across the country

850
00:34:34,560 --> 00:34:35,760
just to meet someone you like.

851
00:34:40,040 --> 00:34:40,680
Do you mean that?

852
00:34:41,120 --> 00:34:41,880
Of course.

853
00:34:44,200 --> 00:34:45,040
To me,

854
00:34:47,160 --> 00:34:48,600
you're the best girl in the whole world.

855
00:34:54,680 --> 00:34:55,840
Are you still upset?

856
00:34:58,120 --> 00:34:58,960
Yes.

857
00:34:59,400 --> 00:34:59,960
Didn't you

858
00:34:59,960 --> 00:35:01,320
listen to what I said earlier?

859
00:35:03,920 --> 00:35:05,080
I'm upset

860
00:35:05,440 --> 00:35:06,520
as I didn't realize

861
00:35:06,520 --> 00:35:07,800
that he's a dreadful scum earlier.

862
00:35:08,520 --> 00:35:09,800
I wasted my feelings on him.

863
00:35:11,640 --> 00:35:13,200
That's the Jiang Yimian I know.

864
00:35:14,640 --> 00:35:15,360
Do you still want to spin around?

865
00:35:16,480 --> 00:35:17,120
Yes.

866
00:35:20,200 --> 00:35:21,120
Quicker.

867
00:35:40,680 --> 00:35:42,640
I wonder if Jiang Yimian is alright now.

868
00:35:43,640 --> 00:35:44,640
Rest assured.

869
00:35:44,640 --> 00:35:45,640
Xie Ang is with her.

870
00:35:46,200 --> 00:35:47,600
Aren't they in bad terms recently?

871
00:35:48,240 --> 00:35:49,680
Don't you know them well enough?

872
00:35:49,920 --> 00:35:51,200
They're probably as good as gold now.

873
00:35:53,120 --> 00:35:53,800
You're right.

874
00:36:00,960 --> 00:36:02,280
The answers are released.

875
00:36:08,960 --> 00:36:09,640
How is it?

876
00:36:11,560 --> 00:36:12,920
I got all correct for now.

877
00:36:21,960 --> 00:36:22,680
Oh, no.

878
00:36:24,520 --> 00:36:26,080
I got the wrong answer
for the last question.

879
00:36:26,760 --> 00:36:27,720
Well.

880
00:36:28,200 --> 00:36:29,560
Are you sure?

881
00:36:30,520 --> 00:36:31,480
Yes.

882
00:36:33,600 --> 00:36:35,040
I hesitated.

883
00:36:35,560 --> 00:36:37,080
How could I pick the wrong answer
for a two-options question?

884
00:36:38,160 --> 00:36:39,200
I'm so foolish.

885
00:36:44,840 --> 00:36:45,760
Well.

886
00:36:46,120 --> 00:36:47,960
Will I miss my chance
to Jinghua University?

887
00:36:49,040 --> 00:36:49,880
You won't.

888
00:36:51,360 --> 00:36:52,640
It's just a winter camp program.

889
00:36:53,000 --> 00:36:54,360
Every road leads to Jinghua University.

890
00:36:54,680 --> 00:36:55,400
If you fail this time,

891
00:36:55,400 --> 00:36:56,160
there's always a next time.

892
00:36:56,800 --> 00:36:57,480
Otherwise,

893
00:36:57,800 --> 00:36:59,040
you can get admitted
with your plain marks.

894
00:37:02,120 --> 00:37:02,840
However,

895
00:37:03,840 --> 00:37:06,120
I'm worried that
I always lack some luck.

896
00:37:18,240 --> 00:37:19,640
I'll share my luck with you.

897
00:37:21,440 --> 00:37:22,280
What is this?

898
00:37:24,080 --> 00:37:24,760
Well.

899
00:37:26,240 --> 00:37:27,360
It's my lucky charm.

900
00:37:28,280 --> 00:37:30,200
It's my first ever laptop.

901
00:37:30,880 --> 00:37:32,000
It has accompanied me for years.

902
00:37:32,440 --> 00:37:34,040
I've taken that with me whenever
I had an examination.

903
00:37:34,760 --> 00:37:36,920
It accompanied me
when I joined the provincial team.

904
00:37:38,640 --> 00:37:39,680
Then, it was broken.

905
00:37:40,160 --> 00:37:41,480
I didn't bear to throw it away.

906
00:37:41,840 --> 00:37:43,640
So, I dismantled
its central processing unit

907
00:37:44,120 --> 00:37:45,720
and made it into this charm.

908
00:37:46,840 --> 00:37:48,160
It has accompanied you
through the years.

909
00:37:48,520 --> 00:37:49,640
It must be important to you.

910
00:37:49,960 --> 00:37:51,240
Are you sure that
you want to give it to me?

911
00:37:52,080 --> 00:37:53,680
You're important to me too.

912
00:37:55,360 --> 00:37:56,040
Besides,

913
00:37:56,480 --> 00:37:57,880
didn't you gift me a keyboard?

914
00:37:58,520 --> 00:37:59,600
Treat it as a give-and-take.

915
00:38:05,880 --> 00:38:08,120
Well, thank you then.

916
00:38:13,080 --> 00:38:14,080
It's quite pretty.

917
00:38:19,360 --> 00:38:20,760
There's one more minute to go.

918
00:38:20,760 --> 00:38:21,840
Hurry up.

919
00:38:23,840 --> 00:38:24,800
What are they doing?

920
00:38:27,440 --> 00:38:29,120
It's not even a new year countdown.

921
00:38:30,560 --> 00:38:32,520
I supposed it's an event countdown.

922
00:38:34,440 --> 00:38:35,280
Whatever.

923
00:38:35,280 --> 00:38:36,400
Let's go check it out.

924
00:38:41,280 --> 00:38:42,160

- One.
- One.

934
00:38:56,640 --> 00:38:58,080
Jinghua University is just as I thought.

935
00:38:58,400 --> 00:38:59,160
Me too.

936
00:38:59,840 --> 00:39:01,080
I'll study really hard.

937
00:39:01,680 --> 00:39:04,040
I'll grow into who I want to be.

938
00:39:06,560 --> 00:39:08,800
See you next year, Jinghua University.

939
00:39:09,120 --> 00:39:10,360
It's this year.

940
00:39:10,360 --> 00:39:11,760
See you this year.

941
00:39:12,080 --> 00:39:13,480
