00:00:06,040 --> 00:00:10,120
[Guilty Maid]
[Episode 24]

2
00:00:10,280 --> 00:00:10,950
Nobody move!

3
00:00:12,150 --> 00:00:12,790
Don't move!

4
00:00:13,710 --> 00:00:15,120
You're all birds of a feather!

5
00:00:15,310 --> 00:00:17,000
Why am I the only one being targeted?

6
00:00:18,070 --> 00:00:19,710
You don't know yet, do you?

7
00:00:20,680 --> 00:00:21,590
It was her.

8
00:00:21,960 --> 00:00:23,430
She killed the Master

9
00:00:23,640 --> 00:00:25,000
and framed the First Madam.

10
00:00:25,360 --> 00:00:26,640
If you report to the authorities,

11
00:00:26,910 --> 00:00:28,360
she won't escape punishment.

12
00:00:28,390 --> 00:00:29,160
I killed him.

13
00:00:29,270 --> 00:00:29,960
She's innocent!

14
00:00:29,960 --> 00:00:30,680
Let her go!

15
00:00:30,750 --> 00:00:31,270
Xian,

16
00:00:31,590 --> 00:00:32,320
no need to hide it anymore.

17
00:00:32,640 --> 00:00:34,150
That old beast

18
00:00:34,360 --> 00:00:35,640
violated me

19
00:00:35,640 --> 00:00:36,880
and forced me to be his concubine.

20
00:00:37,240 --> 00:00:39,360
Wei Xian was just
helping me get revenge.

21
00:00:40,710 --> 00:00:42,110
After all these years
in the Shen family,

22
00:00:42,430 --> 00:00:44,600
all I got was the control
of a tiny workshop.

23
00:00:44,960 --> 00:00:46,390
What's wrong with earning money
through usury?

24
00:00:46,880 --> 00:00:48,640
I just wanted security in my old age.

25
00:00:48,640 --> 00:00:49,790
What did I do wrong?

26
00:00:50,110 --> 00:00:51,000
Your crime

27
00:00:51,680 --> 00:00:52,790
was murdering innocents

28
00:00:52,830 --> 00:00:53,680
and treating lives like dirt.

29
00:00:54,240 --> 00:00:54,510
Xian,

30
00:00:54,510 --> 00:00:54,960
don't mind me.

31
00:00:55,640 --> 00:00:56,430
Go report this to the authorities!

32
00:00:56,640 --> 00:00:57,390
Ignore her?

33
00:00:58,040 --> 00:00:58,880
Fine then.

34
00:01:00,790 --> 00:01:02,240
Then at least think of

35
00:01:02,240 --> 00:01:03,640
the child she's carrying!

36
00:01:03,640 --> 00:01:04,470
Don't be reckless.

37
00:01:04,470 --> 00:01:05,160
Third Madam,

38
00:01:05,240 --> 00:01:05,830
calm down.

39
00:01:05,830 --> 00:01:06,470
No!

40
00:01:37,110 --> 00:01:38,300
Your belly

41
00:01:38,300 --> 00:01:39,600
is fake?

42
00:01:39,630 --> 00:01:41,190
If you and the First Madam

43
00:01:41,350 --> 00:01:42,240
hadn't killed my child

44
00:01:42,240 --> 00:01:43,240
months ago,

45
00:01:43,990 --> 00:01:44,940
I wouldn't have been

46
00:01:44,940 --> 00:01:46,680
driven to this!

47
00:01:50,880 --> 00:01:52,520
After all my scheming,

48
00:01:53,160 --> 00:01:54,990
who knew the deepest mask was yours?

49
00:01:56,110 --> 00:01:57,110
It was you.

50
00:01:58,520 --> 00:01:59,320
The death of the Master

51
00:01:59,630 --> 00:02:00,750
and the First Madam,

52
00:02:01,190 --> 00:02:02,750
and everything happened recently.

53
00:02:03,520 --> 00:02:05,390
Was any of this worth it?

54
00:02:07,320 --> 00:02:08,910
How foolish

55
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:09,510
you all are!

56
00:02:12,400 --> 00:02:13,070
And...

57
00:02:13,880 --> 00:02:16,040
And you dare judge me?

58
00:02:18,840 --> 00:02:20,190
Even now,

59
00:02:20,840 --> 00:02:22,950
you remain unrepentant.

60
00:02:23,880 --> 00:02:25,910
How many people have died

61
00:02:26,510 --> 00:02:27,440
and families been ruined

62
00:02:27,510 --> 00:02:28,750
because of you?

63
00:02:28,880 --> 00:02:30,350
Have you never once thought about it?

64
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:31,440
What?

65
00:02:33,070 --> 00:02:34,400
Who's ever thought about me?

66
00:02:36,880 --> 00:02:38,720
I also want to have a child.

67
00:02:40,160 --> 00:02:42,320
Why should she be the only one
to have a child?

68
00:02:43,600 --> 00:02:45,470
I want someone to mourn me.

69
00:02:46,670 --> 00:02:48,600
I want security in my old age.

70
00:02:50,190 --> 00:02:51,160
But

71
00:02:51,190 --> 00:02:53,400
heaven denied me!

72
00:02:54,230 --> 00:02:55,510
And what wrong had Qiuyue

73
00:02:56,880 --> 00:02:58,470
and the others done?

74
00:03:00,600 --> 00:03:01,790
Qiuyue?

75
00:03:04,750 --> 00:03:06,910
She was just an insignificant casualty

76
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:11,160
in your killing spree.

77
00:03:12,400 --> 00:03:14,670
Is her life worth nothing?

78
00:03:16,750 --> 00:03:17,350
Xingyan!

79
00:03:24,630 --> 00:03:25,400
Xingyan.

80
00:03:26,280 --> 00:03:26,840
Xingyan.

81
00:03:26,950 --> 00:03:27,510
Xingyan.

82
00:03:28,400 --> 00:03:28,750
Xingyan!

83
00:03:28,750 --> 00:03:29,280
Stop!

84
00:03:31,040 --> 00:03:32,160
Call for help!

85
00:03:32,840 --> 00:03:33,280
Something's wrong.

86
00:03:33,400 --> 00:03:34,470
The authorities are here.

87
00:03:34,470 --> 00:03:35,190
What did you

88
00:03:37,040 --> 00:03:37,840
just call me?

89
00:03:38,790 --> 00:03:39,670
Xingyan.

90
00:03:42,280 --> 00:03:43,630
Don't let hatred

91
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:45,750
blind you.

92
00:03:55,950 --> 00:03:57,120
I should have realized sooner.

93
00:03:57,510 --> 00:03:58,670
You're not Ms. Rong.

94
00:04:01,280 --> 00:04:02,470
Don't be sad.

95
00:04:03,120 --> 00:04:04,400
This is my choice.

96
00:04:04,400 --> 00:04:05,280
It has nothing to do with you.

97
00:04:05,670 --> 00:04:06,790
This body

98
00:04:08,230 --> 00:04:10,190
has borne too much blood debt.

99
00:04:12,120 --> 00:04:14,000
This is the best ending for her.

100
00:04:16,200 --> 00:04:16,790
Yunqing.

101
00:04:17,720 --> 00:04:18,280
Yunqing.

102
00:04:19,230 --> 00:04:20,310
You'll be fine.

103
00:04:20,870 --> 00:04:22,080
You'll be alright.

104
00:04:48,900 --> 00:04:49,860
Xingyan,

105
00:04:51,260 --> 00:04:52,620
I really wanted to

106
00:04:53,380 --> 00:04:55,060
walk to the end with you

107
00:04:56,500 --> 00:04:58,420
as Su Yunqing.

108
00:05:00,740 --> 00:05:03,020
But now, this wish

109
00:05:03,540 --> 00:05:05,380
might not come true.

110
00:05:09,820 --> 00:05:11,020
If there's a next life,

111
00:05:11,940 --> 00:05:12,860
I hope

112
00:05:14,380 --> 00:05:15,740
I'll

113
00:05:16,660 --> 00:05:18,780
become your wife

114
00:05:19,780 --> 00:05:21,860
as my true self.

115
00:05:23,500 --> 00:05:24,820
You'll be alright.

116
00:05:25,340 --> 00:05:26,540
You'll be fine.

117
00:05:37,620 --> 00:05:38,460
Yunqing.

118
00:06:16,020 --> 00:06:18,580
As Su Yunqing broke the curse and awoke,

119
00:06:18,860 --> 00:06:20,100
the unconscious Liuli,

120
00:06:20,100 --> 00:06:20,900
Cuiqiao,

121
00:06:21,020 --> 00:06:21,620
and Zhou Furong

122
00:06:21,620 --> 00:06:22,740
gradually regained consciousness.

123
00:06:23,500 --> 00:06:25,900
After the authorities' investigation,

124
00:06:25,900 --> 00:06:26,660
the Third Madam,

125
00:06:26,740 --> 00:06:27,540
Fourth Madam,

126
00:06:27,620 --> 00:06:28,380
and Wei Xian

127
00:06:28,380 --> 00:06:29,900
received their punishments.

128
00:06:30,380 --> 00:06:32,260
Shen Xingyan was disqualified
from the imperial examination

129
00:06:32,260 --> 00:06:33,940
for accidentally injuring someone.

130
00:06:34,500 --> 00:06:35,140
Thereafter,

131
00:06:35,300 --> 00:06:37,540
Shen Xingyan took charge
of both the main house

132
00:06:37,540 --> 00:06:39,300
and the workshop again,

133
00:06:39,300 --> 00:06:40,380
restoring the family's discipline.

134
00:06:40,940 --> 00:06:42,940
He expelled Liuli and Cuiqiao
from the mansion.

135
00:06:43,340 --> 00:06:45,380
Zhou Furong, having been disowned
by her family

136
00:06:45,380 --> 00:06:46,780
and losing her greatest backing,

137
00:06:47,220 --> 00:06:49,260
received her deserved punishment.

138
00:07:11,620 --> 00:07:15,020
[The End]
