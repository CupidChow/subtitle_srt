1
00:00:05,970 --> 00:00:10,050
[Guilty Maid]
[Episode 3]

2
00:00:10,480 --> 00:00:11,560
Drink it!

3
00:00:11,560 --> 00:00:12,670
At least you'll die intact.

4
00:00:12,670 --> 00:00:13,270
Third Madam!

5
00:00:13,590 --> 00:00:14,190
Third Madam,

6
00:00:14,910 --> 00:00:15,960
perhaps I can help you.

7
00:00:20,670 --> 00:00:21,480
Then tell me,

8
00:00:21,550 --> 00:00:22,960
how exactly do you plan to help me?

9
00:00:24,480 --> 00:00:25,800
If you seek something,

10
00:00:26,120 --> 00:00:28,350
you have to contend
with both the heaven and men.

11
00:00:29,710 --> 00:00:30,760
All I seek

12
00:00:31,160 --> 00:00:32,750
is to find my sister

13
00:00:33,150 --> 00:00:34,600
within the Shen mansion.

14
00:00:34,710 --> 00:00:35,390
Third Madam,

15
00:00:36,030 --> 00:00:37,320
I've heard that you're skilled
at managing finances.

16
00:00:37,710 --> 00:00:39,790
You oversee all the accounts
of the Shen family.

17
00:00:40,350 --> 00:00:41,840
Yet every time,

18
00:00:42,280 --> 00:00:44,110
the Fourth Madam finds fault with you.

19
00:00:44,640 --> 00:00:45,640
I can help you

20
00:00:45,790 --> 00:00:47,600
remove this thorn in your side.

21
00:00:48,390 --> 00:00:49,920
She carries the Master's heir.

22
00:00:50,390 --> 00:00:51,880
It's her shield.

23
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:54,240
I've had countless people eliminate her,

24
00:00:54,390 --> 00:00:55,600
yet she still stands.

25
00:00:56,710 --> 00:00:57,560
Then

26
00:00:58,750 --> 00:01:00,320
if I could prove

27
00:01:01,670 --> 00:01:03,200
the child isn't the Master's?

28
00:01:09,200 --> 00:01:10,000
How?

29
00:01:10,200 --> 00:01:11,400
I have a plan.

30
00:01:13,790 --> 00:01:15,000
Then why should I trust you?

31
00:01:15,560 --> 00:01:17,150
If I fail,

32
00:01:18,950 --> 00:01:20,430
you may dispose of me at your leisure.

33
00:01:22,430 --> 00:01:23,040
Very well.

34
00:01:23,760 --> 00:01:24,310
Tomorrow,

35
00:01:24,400 --> 00:01:25,920
you'll serve the Fourth Madam.

36
00:01:26,400 --> 00:01:27,400
Thank you.

37
00:01:29,310 --> 00:01:30,040
Give her the jade pendant.

38
00:01:30,200 --> 00:01:30,760
Yes.

39
00:01:34,120 --> 00:01:35,310
Take this pendant.

40
00:01:36,070 --> 00:01:37,560
It'll help you
gain the Fourth Madam's trust.

41
00:01:46,640 --> 00:01:48,150
Can she really rid us
of the Fourth Madam?

42
00:01:49,040 --> 00:01:50,430
What could she possibly achieve?

43
00:01:51,560 --> 00:01:52,760
She's just buying time.

44
00:01:53,280 --> 00:01:54,400
Then why are you...?

45
00:01:54,870 --> 00:01:56,430
I've already decided to eliminate her.

46
00:01:56,430 --> 00:01:58,040
I don't expect her loyalty.

47
00:01:58,430 --> 00:02:00,200
Killing her would only stain my hands.

48
00:02:00,680 --> 00:02:01,480
Why

49
00:02:01,760 --> 00:02:02,950
bother?

50
00:02:07,840 --> 00:02:08,360
I've seen

51
00:02:08,360 --> 00:02:10,240
this sigil in an ancient text before.

52
00:02:10,630 --> 00:02:11,800
It's a curse.

53
00:02:12,240 --> 00:02:14,030
It could transform you
into someone else.

54
00:02:14,800 --> 00:02:16,150
What if one day you're no longer

55
00:02:16,190 --> 00:02:16,960
my sister?

56
00:02:17,960 --> 00:02:19,870
You might become a filthy beggar

57
00:02:20,680 --> 00:02:22,190
or a venomous crone.

58
00:02:22,280 --> 00:02:23,360
But don't worry.

59
00:02:23,590 --> 00:02:25,280
I will protect you, no matter what.

60
00:02:26,280 --> 00:02:27,120
So

61
00:02:27,360 --> 00:02:28,960
the curse is real after all.

62
00:02:29,590 --> 00:02:31,000
Why have I become Liuli?

63
00:02:31,280 --> 00:02:32,800
What connections do I have with her?

64
00:02:33,120 --> 00:02:34,470
What is happening?

65
00:02:42,590 --> 00:02:43,910
At last, I've entered the main house.

66
00:02:44,400 --> 00:02:45,870
Once I see Shen Xingyan again,

67
00:02:46,080 --> 00:02:47,630
I'll learn my sister's whereabouts.

68
00:02:52,400 --> 00:02:53,310
These

69
00:02:53,800 --> 00:02:56,030
must be spies planted by other madams.

70
00:02:56,560 --> 00:02:58,590
It seems the Fourth Madam
has many enemies.

71
00:02:59,030 --> 00:03:00,870
She's pregnant.

72
00:03:01,710 --> 00:03:02,960
So none of them

73
00:03:03,190 --> 00:03:05,120
want her to deliver this baby.

74
00:03:22,750 --> 00:03:23,710
Are you blind?

75
00:03:23,840 --> 00:03:25,590
What if you had knocked
into the Fourth Madam?

76
00:03:28,800 --> 00:03:30,080
Such a perfect opportunity,

77
00:03:30,240 --> 00:03:31,630
and you wasted it.

78
00:03:31,960 --> 00:03:33,240
Useless.

79
00:03:47,360 --> 00:03:48,150
Fourth Madam.

80
00:03:49,470 --> 00:03:51,310
Thank you for your mercy earlier.

81
00:03:52,150 --> 00:03:53,240
Take this medicine.

82
00:03:54,430 --> 00:03:55,360
It will prevent scarring.

83
00:03:56,680 --> 00:03:58,240
You're so kind, Fourth Madame.

84
00:03:58,400 --> 00:03:59,240
A servant

85
00:03:59,310 --> 00:04:00,680
should never harm her madam.

86
00:04:00,910 --> 00:04:02,280
All my maids

87
00:04:02,280 --> 00:04:03,710
have been driven away by them.

88
00:04:03,840 --> 00:04:05,150
Those left in my courtyard

89
00:04:05,190 --> 00:04:06,630
are nothing but spies.

90
00:04:06,710 --> 00:04:07,870
I'm already used to it.

91
00:04:08,870 --> 00:04:09,680
Then

92
00:04:10,150 --> 00:04:11,710
you must know

93
00:04:13,560 --> 00:04:15,190
I was also sent by the Third Madam.

94
00:04:18,430 --> 00:04:19,430
What's your name?

95
00:04:19,720 --> 00:04:20,750
Liuli.

96
00:04:22,120 --> 00:04:23,000
Liuli?

97
00:04:25,360 --> 00:04:26,750
Here, take the medicine.

98
00:04:26,950 --> 00:04:28,040
Don't neglect your injury.

99
00:04:28,720 --> 00:04:29,680
Thank you.

100
00:04:37,750 --> 00:04:39,270
I feel like I've become someone else.

101
00:04:39,870 --> 00:04:41,120
They're forcing me to drink poison.

102
00:04:42,040 --> 00:04:43,190
I feel unwell.

103
00:04:46,190 --> 00:04:47,720
Why has the sigil vanished?

104
00:04:54,920 --> 00:04:55,720
Mr. Shen,

105
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:56,920
as you instructed,

106
00:04:56,920 --> 00:04:59,190
Su Yunqing has been safely escorted out.

107
00:04:59,600 --> 00:05:00,000
Alright.

108
00:05:02,830 --> 00:05:03,920
Has anyone in the Shen family

109
00:05:04,360 --> 00:05:05,190
been forced

110
00:05:05,630 --> 00:05:06,750
to drink poison recently?

111
00:05:07,270 --> 00:05:07,920
I

112
00:05:07,920 --> 00:05:09,040
did have one case.

113
00:05:09,720 --> 00:05:10,920
But it wasn't poison.

114
00:05:11,310 --> 00:05:12,190
It was

115
00:05:12,720 --> 00:05:13,360
abortifacient.

116
00:05:15,360 --> 00:05:17,040
The only one pregnant in the Shen family

117
00:05:17,240 --> 00:05:18,600
is the Fourth Madam.

118
00:05:19,310 --> 00:05:20,240
Are you saying

119
00:05:20,480 --> 00:05:22,560
someone dared to force her to take drug?

120
00:05:23,160 --> 00:05:24,390
The case remains unresolved.

121
00:05:24,800 --> 00:05:25,480
Fortunately,

122
00:05:25,680 --> 00:05:26,430
it was unsuccessful.

123
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:27,680
But since it

124
00:05:27,680 --> 00:05:28,870
concerns the family's reputation,

125
00:05:29,160 --> 00:05:30,160
the First Madam suppressed it.

126
00:05:31,430 --> 00:05:33,390
Was that the scene Su Yunqing

127
00:05:33,950 --> 00:05:35,160
experienced?

128
00:05:36,190 --> 00:05:37,870
Isn't this matter too absurd?

129
00:05:38,920 --> 00:05:39,830
We'll see

130
00:05:40,240 --> 00:05:42,360
after I meet the Fourth Madam tomorrow.

131
00:05:42,480 --> 00:05:44,120
For now, keep watch on the Fourth Madam

132
00:05:44,680 --> 00:05:46,000
and see if there are any similarities

133
00:05:46,240 --> 00:05:47,480
between her and Su Yunqing.

134
00:05:48,120 --> 00:05:48,720
Understood.

135
00:05:50,070 --> 00:05:50,870
Su Yunqing,

136
00:05:51,390 --> 00:05:53,390
have you truly become someone else?

137
00:05:53,750 --> 00:05:55,040
The curse of the lycoris radiata

138
00:05:55,360 --> 00:05:56,870
is real after all.

139
00:06:06,040 --> 00:06:06,870
Madam.

140
00:06:08,950 --> 00:06:09,720
What are you doing here?

141
00:06:09,750 --> 00:06:11,070
I'm here to assist you with ablutions.

142
00:06:16,120 --> 00:06:17,430
Having someone attend to me so suddenly.

143
00:06:17,800 --> 00:06:18,830
I feel unfamiliar.

144
00:06:19,190 --> 00:06:20,430
Don't say that, Madam.

145
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:22,600
When the Master was still around,

146
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:24,680
no servant dare treat you like this.

147
00:06:25,720 --> 00:06:26,240
And

148
00:06:27,190 --> 00:06:28,750
it's only been a few months
since his departure.

149
00:06:29,040 --> 00:06:30,310
How could you

150
00:06:30,800 --> 00:06:31,830
have grown unaccustomed?

151
00:06:33,120 --> 00:06:34,270
You were sent by the Third Madam.

152
00:06:34,390 --> 00:06:35,430
Yet you're so attentive to me.

153
00:06:35,630 --> 00:06:36,800
Shouldn't I be wary?

154
00:06:37,310 --> 00:06:38,360
Honestly,

155
00:06:39,310 --> 00:06:40,270
I

156
00:06:40,430 --> 00:06:41,480
did something wrong.

157
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:43,240
The Third Madam wanted to kill me.

158
00:06:43,920 --> 00:06:45,720
But I convinced her I could help her.

159
00:06:45,920 --> 00:06:46,830
That's why

160
00:06:47,360 --> 00:06:48,480
she sent me here

161
00:06:49,190 --> 00:06:50,070
to serve you.

162
00:06:52,360 --> 00:06:53,680
Help her?

163
00:06:55,160 --> 00:06:56,600
This is a great opportunity.

164
00:06:57,910 --> 00:06:58,710
I

165
00:06:59,270 --> 00:07:00,350
don't want to harm anyone.

166
00:07:02,030 --> 00:07:03,110
But neither do I

167
00:07:03,990 --> 00:07:05,590
want to die just yet.

168
00:07:06,190 --> 00:07:07,990
So I've come to you, Madam.

169
00:07:19,230 --> 00:07:19,830
Madam.

170
00:07:23,390 --> 00:07:23,790
Leave now.

171
00:07:23,790 --> 00:07:24,590
I'll do it myself.

172
00:07:25,230 --> 00:07:25,510
Yes,

173
00:07:25,510 --> 00:07:26,190
Madam.

174
00:07:38,150 --> 00:07:39,750
I know it was your people
who gave me that abortifacient,

175
00:07:39,750 --> 00:07:41,110
nearly costing me my child.

176
00:07:41,430 --> 00:07:42,590
What are you doing?

177
00:07:45,230 --> 00:07:46,390
If he doesn't come to me

178
00:07:46,870 --> 00:07:49,070
with the jade pendant within a month,

179
00:07:49,470 --> 00:07:51,510
I'll expose everything about you

180
00:07:51,630 --> 00:07:52,950
embezzling the loan funds to make loans.

181
00:08:02,670 --> 00:08:04,110
I've waited too long for this.

182
00:08:04,670 --> 00:08:05,390
Qingqiu,

183
00:08:06,150 --> 00:08:07,670
I can finally avenge you.

184
00:08:08,310 --> 00:08:09,190
Don't be hasty.

185
00:08:09,350 --> 00:08:10,630
We haven't figured everything out yet.

186
00:08:11,350 --> 00:08:12,350
Who else could it be?

187
00:08:33,870 --> 00:08:34,990
Qingqiu and I

188
00:08:35,110 --> 00:08:36,950
grew up together here.

189
00:08:37,790 --> 00:08:39,190
She's the most important person to me.

190
00:08:40,590 --> 00:08:41,510
This is all my fault.

191
00:08:42,030 --> 00:08:44,070
I failed to protect her,

192
00:08:44,710 --> 00:08:46,030
left her to endure humiliation

193
00:08:46,710 --> 00:08:48,230
and suffering

194
00:08:49,030 --> 00:08:50,950
in the Shen family.

195
00:08:57,030 --> 00:08:58,590
Do you still remember this jade pendant?

196
00:09:01,070 --> 00:09:02,470
After you drugged Qingqiu,

197
00:09:02,990 --> 00:09:04,710
you left it behind in her room.

198
00:09:05,910 --> 00:09:07,710
Do you know how potent
that abortifacient was?

199
00:09:08,950 --> 00:09:10,630
It nearly killed her!

200
00:09:13,430 --> 00:09:15,030
I'm no scholar.

201
00:09:15,470 --> 00:09:16,950
I don't know fancy words or big ideas.

202
00:09:17,710 --> 00:09:19,030
But I know this.

203
00:09:19,510 --> 00:09:21,030
Whoever harms my family

204
00:09:21,430 --> 00:09:23,350
will pay the price.
