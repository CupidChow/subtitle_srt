00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:10,080
[Guilty Maid]
[Episode 10]

2
00:00:13,860 --> 00:00:14,780
Shen Xingyan,

3
00:00:15,300 --> 00:00:17,540
so my sister's death
really is tied to you.

4
00:00:17,980 --> 00:00:19,300
You refuse to see me?

5
00:00:20,180 --> 00:00:21,620
You think you can get away with it?

6
00:00:22,980 --> 00:00:24,340
If you won't come to me,

7
00:00:25,300 --> 00:00:27,020
then I'll go to you.

8
00:00:31,140 --> 00:00:31,820
Mr. Shen,

9
00:00:32,180 --> 00:00:33,860
what does Zhou Furong want?

10
00:00:34,300 --> 00:00:35,660
Why is she so desperate to marry you?

11
00:00:35,660 --> 00:00:36,780
Whatever she's plotting,

12
00:00:37,460 --> 00:00:39,140
I'll play along.

13
00:00:39,180 --> 00:00:41,220
Miss Yunqing's whereabouts are unknown.

14
00:00:41,380 --> 00:00:42,380
She hasn't come to see you either.

15
00:00:46,300 --> 00:00:47,860
She must be trapped somewhere.

16
00:00:49,220 --> 00:00:50,300
Have you found out

17
00:00:50,780 --> 00:00:51,780
where Su Zhaohua is?

18
00:00:52,180 --> 00:00:53,260
Still searching.

19
00:00:53,620 --> 00:00:54,860
You saved her out of kindness,

20
00:00:55,420 --> 00:00:56,540
and instead of gratitude,

21
00:00:56,540 --> 00:00:57,980
she repays you with schemes.

22
00:00:58,220 --> 00:00:59,300
What will you do even if we find her?

23
00:00:59,420 --> 00:01:00,980
Would you tell Su Yunqing the truth?

24
00:01:01,580 --> 00:01:02,860
We can't find Su Yunqing.

25
00:01:03,460 --> 00:01:04,460
But she

26
00:01:04,740 --> 00:01:06,660
can find us easily.

27
00:01:07,300 --> 00:01:09,340
If we bring Su Zhaohua into the mansion,

28
00:01:09,740 --> 00:01:10,620
Su Yunqing

29
00:01:11,380 --> 00:01:12,540
will surely show herself.

30
00:01:13,860 --> 00:01:14,780
Mr. Shen, you're brilliant.

31
00:01:15,860 --> 00:01:16,620
Then

32
00:01:17,300 --> 00:01:18,140
what about Zhou Furong?

33
00:01:18,900 --> 00:01:20,140
She's waiting in the bridal chamber.

34
00:01:21,060 --> 00:01:22,060
Let her wait.

35
00:01:25,660 --> 00:01:27,380
Are you feeling better?

36
00:01:27,900 --> 00:01:28,740
Much better.

37
00:01:29,020 --> 00:01:30,340
Thank you for your concern.

38
00:01:30,740 --> 00:01:31,340
That night,

39
00:01:31,460 --> 00:01:32,900
I acted rashly.

40
00:01:33,180 --> 00:01:34,300
I overstepped.

41
00:01:34,420 --> 00:01:35,900
Don't mention it.

42
00:01:35,980 --> 00:01:37,580
We're family now.

43
00:01:37,660 --> 00:01:39,100
No need for such formality.

44
00:01:39,900 --> 00:01:42,380
How did things go
with Xingyan last night?

45
00:01:45,780 --> 00:01:47,260
He refused to see me.

46
00:01:48,020 --> 00:01:49,660
Didn't enter the room all night.

47
00:01:50,100 --> 00:01:51,380
I wanted to bear a child soon

48
00:01:51,380 --> 00:01:52,780
to ease your burdens,

49
00:01:53,460 --> 00:01:54,860
but given the...

50
00:01:55,220 --> 00:01:56,660
This is outrageous.

51
00:01:58,300 --> 00:01:59,900
I'll talk to him.

52
00:02:00,140 --> 00:02:02,060
If he's unwilling,

53
00:02:02,620 --> 00:02:04,740
even if we meet, it's...

54
00:02:05,660 --> 00:02:06,980
You're right.

55
00:02:08,180 --> 00:02:09,420
Xingyan

56
00:02:09,420 --> 00:02:11,620
spends all his time
managing business affairs.

57
00:02:11,780 --> 00:02:13,420
He won't listen to anyone.

58
00:02:13,820 --> 00:02:15,620
As his mother, I'm worried.

59
00:02:17,020 --> 00:02:19,420
If only I could help him.

60
00:02:20,660 --> 00:02:22,460
Then we'd have something to talk about

61
00:02:23,220 --> 00:02:24,900
and grow closer.

62
00:02:26,140 --> 00:02:27,860
That's actually a good idea.

63
00:02:28,940 --> 00:02:29,940
You're a married man now.

64
00:02:29,940 --> 00:02:31,220
Instead of spending the evening
with Furong,

65
00:02:31,340 --> 00:02:32,860
you're still buried in work.

66
00:02:32,860 --> 00:02:33,900
Is this appropriate?

67
00:02:34,060 --> 00:02:36,300
Do you know what the other madams
are saying about you?

68
00:02:36,380 --> 00:02:37,420
They say you're impotent!

69
00:02:38,180 --> 00:02:39,340
Let them say whatever they want.

70
00:02:39,740 --> 00:02:41,100
If their gossip offends you,

71
00:02:41,140 --> 00:02:42,380
have them expelled.

72
00:02:42,620 --> 00:02:43,740
Expelled?

73
00:02:43,860 --> 00:02:45,740
So they can spread word outside

74
00:02:46,100 --> 00:02:48,220
that you're impotent?

75
00:02:50,020 --> 00:02:51,380
Once the imperial results
are publicized,

76
00:02:51,820 --> 00:02:53,820
there'll be no place for me
in the Shen family anyway.

77
00:02:54,660 --> 00:02:56,060
I'd better leave on my own

78
00:02:56,100 --> 00:02:58,060
than be cast out.

79
00:02:59,660 --> 00:03:00,220
Mother,

80
00:03:00,620 --> 00:03:01,340
I have a plan.

81
00:03:01,340 --> 00:03:02,660
Don't worry.

82
00:03:02,780 --> 00:03:03,980
You should rest.

83
00:03:04,020 --> 00:03:04,900
I still have matters to attend to.

84
00:03:04,900 --> 00:03:06,020
You make it sound so simple.

85
00:03:06,260 --> 00:03:07,540
Don't worry?

86
00:03:07,580 --> 00:03:08,860
Work is all you ever think about!

87
00:03:08,980 --> 00:03:10,340
The Shen family has a huge business.

88
00:03:10,340 --> 00:03:12,100
It won't collapse without anyone!

89
00:03:12,700 --> 00:03:13,300
Fine.

90
00:03:13,740 --> 00:03:16,420
Too busy to spare a thought
for your wife, are you?

91
00:03:16,860 --> 00:03:17,540
Very well.

92
00:03:17,540 --> 00:03:20,060
Then Furong will assist you
with business affairs.

93
00:03:24,380 --> 00:03:25,540
Was this her suggestion?

94
00:03:25,620 --> 00:03:26,780
It doesn't matter who suggested it.

95
00:03:27,180 --> 00:03:28,140
It's settled.

96
00:03:28,340 --> 00:03:29,740
Strike where it hurts most.

97
00:03:30,820 --> 00:03:31,980
Zhou Furong

98
00:03:32,300 --> 00:03:33,820
is really good at it.

99
00:03:34,740 --> 00:03:36,060
Where are you going?

100
00:03:36,060 --> 00:03:37,620
Doesn't she want a wedding night?

101
00:03:37,900 --> 00:03:39,220
Then she'll have it.

102
00:03:40,020 --> 00:03:40,820
You rascal,

103
00:03:40,940 --> 00:03:42,540
always playing me for a fool.

104
00:03:44,780 --> 00:03:46,620
Now that I've become Zhou Furong,

105
00:03:47,300 --> 00:03:49,020
maybe I can use this to get close to him

106
00:03:49,020 --> 00:03:50,260
to find out the truth.

107
00:03:51,020 --> 00:03:52,940
But Shen Xingyan is unpredictable.

108
00:03:53,460 --> 00:03:55,140
I need to stay on guard.

109
00:04:00,340 --> 00:04:01,620
Dear, you're back.

110
00:04:03,300 --> 00:04:04,100
What...

111
00:04:04,580 --> 00:04:05,660
What are you doing?

112
00:04:12,260 --> 00:04:13,860
Didn't you want to see me?

113
00:04:14,300 --> 00:04:15,540
Now you'll get your wish.

114
00:04:16,940 --> 00:04:18,660
Shen Xingyan!

115
00:04:18,860 --> 00:04:20,060
Shen Xingyan, have you lost your mind?

116
00:04:21,100 --> 00:04:21,980
The door is still open,

117
00:04:21,980 --> 00:04:22,620
Shen Xingyan.

118
00:04:24,060 --> 00:04:25,860
You climbed into my bed uninvited.

119
00:04:26,420 --> 00:04:28,220
The whole world already knows
your bad reputation.

120
00:04:28,900 --> 00:04:30,580
Why bother with the door now?

121
00:04:31,060 --> 00:04:31,700
Might as well

122
00:04:32,060 --> 00:04:33,580
let the rumors spread.

123
00:04:35,540 --> 00:04:36,300
Shen Xingyan!

124
00:04:36,660 --> 00:04:37,580
Let me go!

125
00:04:37,620 --> 00:04:38,580
Shen Xingyan!

126
00:04:41,460 --> 00:04:42,540
Can't touch you?

127
00:04:43,540 --> 00:04:45,660
You schemed relentlessly
to force me here.

128
00:04:46,140 --> 00:04:47,620
Now that I've come,

129
00:04:47,860 --> 00:04:49,100
you're still unsatisfied?

130
00:04:53,100 --> 00:04:54,060
What are you doing?

131
00:04:54,380 --> 00:04:55,300
Put me down!

132
00:04:55,420 --> 00:04:56,540
Put me down!

133
00:04:56,980 --> 00:04:57,940
Put me down!

134
00:05:01,300 --> 00:05:02,140
Shen Xingyan,

135
00:05:03,020 --> 00:05:04,340
don't push me.

136
00:05:07,580 --> 00:05:08,620
What are you doing?

137
00:05:08,940 --> 00:05:10,420
You'll find out soon enough.

138
00:05:11,380 --> 00:05:12,300
Don't worry.

139
00:05:12,900 --> 00:05:14,660
I'll make sure you're satisfied.

140
00:05:16,260 --> 00:05:17,180
Let me go!

141
00:05:17,740 --> 00:05:18,300
Let go of me!

142
00:05:18,300 --> 00:05:19,460
Let go!

143
00:05:22,740 --> 00:05:23,940
What are you doing?

144
00:05:28,180 --> 00:05:29,460
Let me go!

145
00:05:30,580 --> 00:05:31,580
Let go!

146
00:05:53,060 --> 00:05:54,900
You want to be the young mistress
of the Shen family?

147
00:05:55,780 --> 00:05:56,940
I'm okay with it.

148
00:05:57,620 --> 00:05:59,300
We'll stay out of each other's way.

149
00:05:59,740 --> 00:06:00,860
But if you dare set your sights

150
00:06:00,860 --> 00:06:02,700
on the Shen family's business,

151
00:06:04,540 --> 00:06:06,460
then next time, this dagger

152
00:06:06,580 --> 00:06:08,540
will pierce your neck.

153
00:06:21,380 --> 00:06:22,340
Young Mistress,

154
00:06:22,460 --> 00:06:24,460
the First Madam has been unwell lately.

155
00:06:24,460 --> 00:06:26,540
I'm afraid she can't receive you.

156
00:06:26,740 --> 00:06:28,060
Has she seen a physician?

157
00:06:29,340 --> 00:06:30,100
It's a mental affliction.

158
00:06:30,620 --> 00:06:31,820
No cure for it.

159
00:06:32,180 --> 00:06:32,980
A mental affliction?

160
00:06:34,100 --> 00:06:35,620
Is there anything I can do to help?

161
00:06:38,820 --> 00:06:39,340
Here.

162
00:06:39,660 --> 00:06:40,540
Have a seat.

163
00:06:42,660 --> 00:06:43,700
You know

164
00:06:43,900 --> 00:06:45,980
the First Madam
has no children of her own.

165
00:06:46,140 --> 00:06:48,260
She and Master are originally married.

166
00:06:48,580 --> 00:06:50,140
She worked tirelessly

167
00:06:50,540 --> 00:06:53,100
to raise the Shen family
to its current standing.

168
00:06:53,660 --> 00:06:54,980
Yet now,

169
00:06:54,980 --> 00:06:57,540
all of it will be handed to an outsider.

170
00:06:58,060 --> 00:06:59,620
Mr. Shen may be a concubine's son,

171
00:06:59,780 --> 00:07:01,220
but he's still of Shen family blood.

172
00:07:01,540 --> 00:07:03,260
How can you say it's being handed
to an outsider?

173
00:07:05,140 --> 00:07:06,780
The Second Madam, relying on Mr. Shen

174
00:07:06,780 --> 00:07:08,620
being the only male heir,

175
00:07:08,900 --> 00:07:11,540
has never shown the First Madam
proper respect.

176
00:07:11,940 --> 00:07:14,140
If she has a grandson,

177
00:07:15,020 --> 00:07:15,820
no one in the Shen family

178
00:07:16,020 --> 00:07:17,820
will be able to keep her in check.

179
00:07:18,460 --> 00:07:20,780
The First Madam went to great lengths

180
00:07:20,940 --> 00:07:22,860
to arrange your marriage.

181
00:07:23,620 --> 00:07:25,700
But Mr. Shen shows you no affection.

182
00:07:26,340 --> 00:07:27,940
After you give birth to his child,

183
00:07:28,220 --> 00:07:30,260
he'll surely kick you out.

184
00:07:32,180 --> 00:07:33,060
How about this?

185
00:07:33,380 --> 00:07:35,260
After the child is born,

186
00:07:35,620 --> 00:07:37,340
you let the First Madam
raise it as her own?

187
00:07:37,740 --> 00:07:39,580
That way, you'd earn her favor,

188
00:07:39,860 --> 00:07:41,700
secure your position,

189
00:07:42,140 --> 00:07:43,140
and she

190
00:07:43,580 --> 00:07:44,980
will have an heir.

191
00:07:45,380 --> 00:07:46,780
A win-win situation.

192
00:07:47,100 --> 00:07:48,180
What do you think?

193
00:07:48,780 --> 00:07:50,260
She's testing me.

194
00:07:50,860 --> 00:07:53,100
But I can never have his child.

195
00:07:55,100 --> 00:07:56,460
Ms. Liu, thank you for your advice.

196
00:07:56,980 --> 00:07:58,140
Let me think it over.

197
00:07:58,620 --> 00:08:00,340
And please convey to the First Madam

198
00:08:00,380 --> 00:08:01,860
that as the mistress of the house,

199
00:08:01,900 --> 00:08:04,180
she deserves
this child's filial devotion

200
00:08:04,380 --> 00:08:06,140
regardless of who raises it.

201
00:08:07,340 --> 00:08:09,100
Think carefully.

202
00:08:11,980 --> 00:08:14,020
Since the First Madam
isn't feeling well today,

203
00:08:14,260 --> 00:08:15,940
I'll come visit her another day.

204
00:08:24,900 --> 00:08:26,060
Ungrateful.

205
00:08:26,780 --> 00:08:28,340
When I arranged for her to marry in,

206
00:08:28,340 --> 00:08:29,940
I thought she could be of use to me.

207
00:08:30,660 --> 00:08:32,340
Since she won't listen,

208
00:08:32,900 --> 00:08:34,460
then we'll find an opportunity

209
00:08:34,620 --> 00:08:36,220
to depose her as the young mistress.

210
00:08:40,460 --> 00:08:43,100
Who knows if you're helping me
or just using me.

211
00:08:43,940 --> 00:08:45,180
What do you want,

212
00:08:45,180 --> 00:08:45,740
Shen Xingyan?

213
00:08:47,180 --> 00:08:48,780
The Shen mansion is a nest of vipers.

214
00:08:49,140 --> 00:08:50,580
If you want the truth,

215
00:08:50,980 --> 00:08:52,620
you'll have to learn patience.

216
00:08:53,700 --> 00:08:55,340
I'd rather not return

217
00:08:55,900 --> 00:08:58,020
to find you in the mass graves.

218
00:09:01,020 --> 00:09:03,140
Just stay quietly in the Shen family.

219
00:09:03,260 --> 00:09:04,620
Everything I've done

220
00:09:04,900 --> 00:09:06,300
has been to protect you.

221
00:09:08,220 --> 00:09:10,380
So the Shen mansion truly is
a nest of vipers.

222
00:09:11,020 --> 00:09:12,420
No wonder the First Madam
turned a blind eye

223
00:09:12,460 --> 00:09:14,060
to the Fourth Madam's plight.

224
00:09:15,100 --> 00:09:16,340
Who knows

225
00:09:16,340 --> 00:09:17,700
how she'll deal with me next.

226
00:09:17,940 --> 00:09:18,620
No.

227
00:09:18,780 --> 00:09:21,100
I must find a way to stay
and find the proof.

228
00:09:24,460 --> 00:09:25,260
Ziming?

229
00:09:35,820 --> 00:09:36,580
Mr. Shen,

230
00:09:36,860 --> 00:09:38,900
I've combed 30 li in every direction

231
00:09:39,180 --> 00:09:40,940
from where we saved Su Zhaohua.

232
00:09:41,260 --> 00:09:42,300
No trace at all.

233
00:09:43,260 --> 00:09:44,940
He once saved my sister?

234
00:09:46,140 --> 00:09:47,660
You're saying she's alive?

235
00:09:48,020 --> 00:09:48,900
Shen Xingyan.

236
00:09:55,620 --> 00:09:56,220
Yes.

237
00:10:05,980 --> 00:10:08,060
When did I ever say she was dead?

238
00:10:08,380 --> 00:10:09,620
How could you not know

239
00:10:10,100 --> 00:10:11,700
whether she's alive or dead?

240
00:10:11,980 --> 00:10:13,300
Stop playing dumb.

241
00:10:15,220 --> 00:10:16,340
Or

242
00:10:17,020 --> 00:10:19,220
are you not Zhou Furong at all?

243
00:10:21,940 --> 00:10:23,900
I need the truth from him.

244
00:10:24,020 --> 00:10:25,460
I can't reveal myself yet.
