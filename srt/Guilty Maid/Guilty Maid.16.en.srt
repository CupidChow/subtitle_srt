[Guilty Maid]
[Episode 16]

2
00:00:21,980 --> 00:00:23,780
I heard about the blueprints.

3
00:00:36,440 --> 00:00:38,160
Familiar, aren't they?

4
00:00:39,980 --> 00:00:40,860
I helped design those

5
00:00:40,860 --> 00:00:42,940
for my former best friend.

6
00:00:58,940 --> 00:01:00,160
But she's dead.

7
00:01:01,800 --> 00:01:02,720
Now,

8
00:01:03,800 --> 00:01:04,840
I have no friends left.

9
00:01:08,120 --> 00:01:08,970
Yunqing,

10
00:01:10,140 --> 00:01:10,660
it is my bad.

11
00:01:10,660 --> 00:01:11,140
Yunqing,

12
00:01:12,220 --> 00:01:12,840
please,

13
00:01:12,840 --> 00:01:14,120
please help me!

14
00:01:14,140 --> 00:01:14,840
Yunqing,

15
00:01:15,020 --> 00:01:16,580
Mr. Shen threw me out.

16
00:01:16,840 --> 00:01:18,400
Even the First Madam hates me.

17
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:20,640
I don't want to go back to the workshop.

18
00:01:20,780 --> 00:01:21,640
Yunqing,

19
00:01:22,300 --> 00:01:23,580
give me a hand,

20
00:01:23,580 --> 00:01:24,640
just this once.

21
00:01:24,640 --> 00:01:26,500
Please help me one last time!

22
00:01:26,500 --> 00:01:27,220
Yunqing,

23
00:01:27,220 --> 00:01:28,060
I only have you now.

24
00:01:28,060 --> 00:01:28,840
Yunqing,

25
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:29,280
please,

26
00:01:29,280 --> 00:01:30,050
I beg you.

27
00:01:30,280 --> 00:01:32,050
Please help me!

28
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:42,530
I'm no longer the Su Yunqing you knew.

29
00:01:44,020 --> 00:01:45,640
The Su Yunqing you knew

30
00:01:47,300 --> 00:01:48,360
is already gone.

31
00:01:55,580 --> 00:01:56,360
Yunqing.

32
00:01:56,700 --> 00:01:58,120
Yunqing.

33
00:01:59,200 --> 00:02:01,090
Su Yunqing!

34
00:02:13,520 --> 00:02:14,260
Qiuyue,

35
00:02:14,260 --> 00:02:15,380
why're you here?

36
00:02:22,480 --> 00:02:23,800
Well,

37
00:02:24,420 --> 00:02:25,640
it's you.

38
00:02:26,100 --> 00:02:27,760
You made that blueprint, didn't you?

39
00:02:28,520 --> 00:02:29,680
Besides Su Yunqing,

40
00:02:30,100 --> 00:02:31,580
only you knew

41
00:02:31,580 --> 00:02:33,200
I designed those pieces.

42
00:02:33,760 --> 00:02:35,170
You're all trying to ruin me.

43
00:02:35,260 --> 00:02:36,640
You're all trying to ruin me!

44
00:02:37,300 --> 00:02:38,100
Why?

45
00:02:39,380 --> 00:02:40,860
I finally made it to the main house,

46
00:02:40,860 --> 00:02:42,360
yet you still won't let me go!

47
00:02:42,580 --> 00:02:44,360
You bullied me.

48
00:02:44,860 --> 00:02:45,300
I have no choice.

49
00:02:45,300 --> 00:02:46,020
So it's you.

50
00:02:46,360 --> 00:02:48,140
Why do you always oppose me?

51
00:02:48,140 --> 00:02:49,640
Why?

52
00:02:52,020 --> 00:02:53,420
Say something!

53
00:02:53,700 --> 00:02:54,640
Tell me,

54
00:02:55,360 --> 00:02:56,240
why!

55
00:03:14,900 --> 00:03:16,200
Bury the corpse.

56
00:03:16,300 --> 00:03:17,330
Keep it quiet.

57
00:03:18,140 --> 00:03:19,610
Just a maid.

58
00:03:20,140 --> 00:03:20,920
Wait,

59
00:03:22,260 --> 00:03:23,680
this's a human life.

60
00:03:23,680 --> 00:03:25,240
Madams,

61
00:03:25,680 --> 00:03:27,050
don't you obey the laws?

62
00:03:29,700 --> 00:03:31,580
How do you know she didn't kill herself?

63
00:03:31,580 --> 00:03:33,330
A proper investigation would tell.

64
00:03:33,620 --> 00:03:35,020
We should report this.

65
00:03:35,300 --> 00:03:36,080
First Madam,

66
00:03:36,080 --> 00:03:36,890
in my opinion,

67
00:03:36,890 --> 00:03:38,200
there's something evil

68
00:03:38,200 --> 00:03:39,610
in this house.

69
00:03:39,610 --> 00:03:40,920
Three maids have fainted.

70
00:03:40,920 --> 00:03:42,020
Now one is dead.

71
00:03:42,020 --> 00:03:42,760
Shouldn't we find a master...?

72
00:03:42,760 --> 00:03:43,520
Nonsense!

73
00:03:45,020 --> 00:03:46,050
We're all fine

74
00:03:46,050 --> 00:03:47,140
without any trouble.

75
00:03:48,260 --> 00:03:49,680
If word gets out,

76
00:03:49,820 --> 00:03:51,520
we'll be laughed at!

77
00:03:52,240 --> 00:03:53,760
I said to bury her.

78
00:03:53,920 --> 00:03:55,760
And no one can object.

79
00:04:06,260 --> 00:04:07,960
She must've died earlier.

80
00:04:08,360 --> 00:04:10,640
So there's a foul smell lately.

81
00:04:11,050 --> 00:04:13,260
It's strongest near First Madam's court.

82
00:04:13,260 --> 00:04:14,170
Not here.

83
00:04:14,610 --> 00:04:16,580
Did she die there first?

84
00:04:16,580 --> 00:04:17,800
Who knows?

85
00:04:17,800 --> 00:04:20,000
First Madam acted strangely today.

86
00:04:20,020 --> 00:04:20,970
Just hold up!

87
00:04:20,970 --> 00:04:21,940
It's so unlucky.

88
00:04:21,940 --> 00:04:23,090
Escort me back.

89
00:04:23,580 --> 00:04:25,120
My head aches.

90
00:04:28,580 --> 00:04:30,530
Strange events mean trouble's near.

91
00:04:30,920 --> 00:04:31,680
Could it be...?

92
00:04:31,800 --> 00:04:33,680
Someone else died in her court?

93
00:04:34,360 --> 00:04:35,530
She's hiding it

94
00:04:35,700 --> 00:04:36,920
and won't report this.

95
00:04:59,020 --> 00:05:01,440
Why did First Madam order a carriage

96
00:05:01,620 --> 00:05:03,120
in midnight?

97
00:05:03,440 --> 00:05:05,360
I saw Zhou Furong leave with her too.

98
00:05:05,360 --> 00:05:06,650
Were they heading out together?

99
00:05:06,820 --> 00:05:08,210
Things aren't peaceful in the mansion.

100
00:05:08,360 --> 00:05:10,180
I guess something would happen.

101
00:05:10,180 --> 00:05:11,440
Be careful these days.

102
00:05:20,820 --> 00:05:21,680
Madam.

103
00:05:21,900 --> 00:05:23,060
First Madam!

104
00:05:23,860 --> 00:05:25,380
Don't believe Zhou Furong's lies!

105
00:05:25,420 --> 00:05:26,620
She's a liar!

106
00:05:26,620 --> 00:05:28,380
What are you yelling at midnight?

107
00:05:28,620 --> 00:05:29,300
Zhou Furong,

108
00:05:29,660 --> 00:05:30,860
don't hide in First Madam's carriage.

109
00:05:30,860 --> 00:05:31,700
Come out!

110
00:05:31,820 --> 00:05:32,860
What are you hiding from?

111
00:05:32,860 --> 00:05:33,940
Come out right now!

112
00:05:34,660 --> 00:05:35,940
Face me!

113
00:05:37,940 --> 00:05:38,820
Shut up!

114
00:05:39,060 --> 00:05:41,020
You want to wake everyone up?

115
00:05:41,060 --> 00:05:42,100
Zhou Furong isn't here.

116
00:05:42,100 --> 00:05:43,060
Ms. Liu,

117
00:05:43,380 --> 00:05:44,180
come here.

118
00:05:47,660 --> 00:05:48,300
First Madam.

119
00:05:48,900 --> 00:05:49,740
Madam.

120
00:05:49,940 --> 00:05:50,740
Madam!

121
00:05:59,340 --> 00:06:00,660
Things have come to this.

122
00:06:01,140 --> 00:06:03,020
There's no other way.

123
00:06:03,060 --> 00:06:05,500
Pity the child in her womb.

124
00:06:06,740 --> 00:06:07,420
First Madam!

125
00:06:07,700 --> 00:06:08,940
Look what you've done.

126
00:06:09,060 --> 00:06:10,440
You just woke everyone up.

127
00:06:10,920 --> 00:06:12,360
Zhou Furong isn't here.

128
00:06:12,360 --> 00:06:13,240
Go back now.

129
00:06:13,260 --> 00:06:14,260
I don't believe it!

130
00:06:19,820 --> 00:06:22,020
First Madam fell into the lake!

131
00:06:22,240 --> 00:06:23,240
Someone!

132
00:06:23,580 --> 00:06:25,120
Help!

133
00:06:34,120 --> 00:06:35,090
Hurry up!

134
00:06:36,380 --> 00:06:37,240
This way!

135
00:06:37,740 --> 00:06:38,440
Is she okay?

136
00:06:39,140 --> 00:06:40,050
Master Shen.

137
00:06:41,480 --> 00:06:42,530
Where's Master?

138
00:06:43,060 --> 00:06:44,440
Useless fools!

139
00:06:44,800 --> 00:06:45,880
Save Master!

140
00:06:45,880 --> 00:06:47,090
Go save him!

141
00:06:47,380 --> 00:06:48,800
Save him!

142
00:06:51,060 --> 00:06:52,820
Why was Master in the carriage?

143
00:06:53,360 --> 00:06:54,920
When did he come back?

144
00:06:55,500 --> 00:06:56,700
So late at night,

145
00:06:56,920 --> 00:06:59,090
why were they going out together?

146
00:07:00,060 --> 00:07:02,820
Why would they share one carriage?

147
00:07:03,360 --> 00:07:04,800
That's strange.

148
00:07:05,800 --> 00:07:06,680
Qiuyue!

149
00:07:07,020 --> 00:07:08,820
She killed Master!

150
00:07:08,940 --> 00:07:11,580
Go! Catch her!

151
00:07:11,580 --> 00:07:14,020
Don't let her escape!

152
00:07:14,380 --> 00:07:14,980
Go, go, go!

153
00:07:14,980 --> 00:07:16,180
I heard Qiuyue's been caught.

154
00:07:16,420 --> 00:07:17,980
I can't believe she killed Master.

155
00:07:18,100 --> 00:07:19,180
She's crazy.

156
00:07:19,180 --> 00:07:20,700
She'll be beaten to death this time.

157
00:07:30,180 --> 00:07:30,940
Oh no,

158
00:07:31,480 --> 00:07:33,410
am I turning into Qiuyue?

159
00:07:47,920 --> 00:07:48,770
So it's true,

160
00:07:49,240 --> 00:07:51,290
I've become the murderer
who killed Master.
