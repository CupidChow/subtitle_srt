00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:10,080
[Guilty Maid]
[Episode 13]

2
00:00:10,880 --> 00:00:11,800
Qiuyue,

3
00:00:12,320 --> 00:00:14,080
you can't even grasp basic herbology,

4
00:00:14,110 --> 00:00:15,800
yet you dare try poisoning me?

5
00:00:16,070 --> 00:00:18,640
The Rhizome of Common Lophantherum
has a light taste,

6
00:00:18,870 --> 00:00:21,000
but who'd mistake it for tea leaves?

7
00:00:21,550 --> 00:00:22,440
Rhizome of Common Lophantherum?

8
00:00:22,960 --> 00:00:24,280
Mrs. Shen, please forgive me.

9
00:00:24,480 --> 00:00:26,230
I'm newly transferred from the workshop

10
00:00:26,440 --> 00:00:27,920
and still lack experience.

11
00:00:28,320 --> 00:00:30,070
Did I brew the wrong tea?

12
00:00:31,870 --> 00:00:33,030
Do you know

13
00:00:33,320 --> 00:00:36,030
what punishment awaits you
if you try to make me lose my baby?

14
00:00:37,150 --> 00:00:38,430
Mrs. Shen, have mercy.

15
00:00:38,430 --> 00:00:39,110
Though

16
00:00:39,110 --> 00:00:41,240
I don't understand what you're implying,

17
00:00:41,350 --> 00:00:42,560
It was my fault.

18
00:00:42,600 --> 00:00:44,240
Please spare me!

19
00:00:45,030 --> 00:00:45,880
Did First Madam

20
00:00:46,470 --> 00:00:48,200
give you this herbal soup?

21
00:00:50,030 --> 00:00:51,320
Mrs. Shen,

22
00:00:51,320 --> 00:00:52,670
I don't understand.

23
00:00:52,790 --> 00:00:54,000
If I had a miscarriage,

24
00:00:54,390 --> 00:00:55,710
you'd take the blame,

25
00:00:56,110 --> 00:00:57,600
and she wouldn't protect you.

26
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:00,240
Are you sure you want to be her pawn?

27
00:01:01,470 --> 00:01:02,470
I'm so stupid.

28
00:01:02,790 --> 00:01:04,200
Mrs. Shen, please punish me.

29
00:01:04,400 --> 00:01:05,200
Don't say that,

30
00:01:05,200 --> 00:01:06,590
and stop apologizing.

31
00:01:06,680 --> 00:01:07,710
Just stand up!

32
00:01:11,590 --> 00:01:13,070
I won't punish you.

33
00:01:13,640 --> 00:01:15,280
I've always considered you a friend.

34
00:01:15,840 --> 00:01:16,680
What?

35
00:01:17,560 --> 00:01:20,400
I had a friend named Su Yunqing.

36
00:01:20,400 --> 00:01:21,310
Yunqing?

37
00:01:22,640 --> 00:01:24,480
But she's been in a coma for ages.

38
00:01:24,950 --> 00:01:26,870
She once told me

39
00:01:26,870 --> 00:01:28,280
you were her friend.

40
00:01:28,560 --> 00:01:29,680
So remember this,

41
00:01:29,790 --> 00:01:31,430
I'm your friend, too,

42
00:01:31,950 --> 00:01:33,150
not your enemy.

43
00:01:49,070 --> 00:01:50,870
Useless girl.

44
00:01:51,280 --> 00:01:52,560
It's been so long.

45
00:01:52,590 --> 00:01:54,950
You still haven't won Mr. Shen's heart.

46
00:01:55,400 --> 00:01:56,640
Zhou Furong

47
00:01:56,840 --> 00:01:57,790
must've slipped him

48
00:01:57,790 --> 00:01:59,120
some love potion.

49
00:02:00,040 --> 00:02:01,040
First Madam,

50
00:02:01,040 --> 00:02:02,680
please give me more time.

51
00:02:03,150 --> 00:02:04,640
Days have passed.

52
00:02:05,070 --> 00:02:07,000
My patience wears thin.

53
00:02:08,960 --> 00:02:09,870
First Madam,

54
00:02:09,870 --> 00:02:12,190
Mr. Shen isn't swayed by beauty.

55
00:02:12,310 --> 00:02:14,150
She needs some time.

56
00:02:15,030 --> 00:02:16,080
Fine.

57
00:02:16,710 --> 00:02:18,310
I'll give you a few more days then.

58
00:02:19,190 --> 00:02:22,030
Remember, I hold your indenture papers.

59
00:02:22,910 --> 00:02:24,750
Disobey me,

60
00:02:25,560 --> 00:02:27,840
and you'll be sold to the brothels.

61
00:02:27,870 --> 00:02:29,030
Thank you, First Madam.

62
00:02:29,030 --> 00:02:30,310
Thank you so much.

63
00:02:31,750 --> 00:02:32,960
Sometimes,

64
00:02:33,470 --> 00:02:35,030
to achieve your goals,

65
00:02:35,030 --> 00:02:36,750
you must get your hands dirty.

66
00:02:37,590 --> 00:02:39,680
Make Zhou Furong believe

67
00:02:40,750 --> 00:02:42,400
Shen Xingyan favors you.

68
00:02:43,310 --> 00:02:44,240
Once rumors spread,

69
00:02:44,560 --> 00:02:47,560
no matter how she restrains

70
00:02:47,910 --> 00:02:49,840
her temper,

71
00:02:50,590 --> 00:02:52,470
it'll drive a wedge

72
00:02:53,840 --> 00:02:54,910
between them.

73
00:02:57,240 --> 00:02:57,910
Got it.

74
00:03:17,680 --> 00:03:18,910
Has your injury healed?

75
00:03:20,960 --> 00:03:21,870
Mr. Shen.

76
00:03:22,400 --> 00:03:24,150
Mr. Shen, I'm so surprised

77
00:03:24,360 --> 00:03:26,080
that you remember I was hurt.

78
00:03:26,120 --> 00:03:27,190
Just be casual.

79
00:03:27,400 --> 00:03:29,680
I need you to tell me the truth.

80
00:03:30,630 --> 00:03:31,800
Why are you hiding here crying?

81
00:03:32,080 --> 00:03:33,750
What troubles you?

82
00:03:33,960 --> 00:03:34,560
I...

83
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:36,240
I don't know.

84
00:03:36,590 --> 00:03:38,190
Perhaps because at the workshop

85
00:03:38,190 --> 00:03:40,310
you disciplined Ms. Rong for me,

86
00:03:40,590 --> 00:03:41,560
people started saying

87
00:03:42,360 --> 00:03:43,680
you fancy me.

88
00:03:44,150 --> 00:03:46,360
They even said that I carry your child.

89
00:03:46,430 --> 00:03:47,870
Mrs. Shen heard the gossip

90
00:03:48,560 --> 00:03:50,400
and accused me of brewing abortion tea.

91
00:03:50,800 --> 00:03:53,080
I truly didn't know
about Rhizome of Common Lophantherum.

92
00:03:53,910 --> 00:03:54,870
Abortion tea?

93
00:04:01,080 --> 00:04:01,960
Rumors are vicious.

94
00:04:02,360 --> 00:04:03,280
You've suffered unfairly.

95
00:04:03,870 --> 00:04:05,910
If anyone dares spread such lies again,

96
00:04:05,910 --> 00:04:07,080
just let me know.

97
00:04:07,080 --> 00:04:09,190
I'll silence those wagging tongues.

98
00:04:10,400 --> 00:04:11,360
Mr. Shen,

99
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:13,470
you're so kind to me.

100
00:04:13,870 --> 00:04:15,400
Your wife might get jealous.

101
00:04:16,160 --> 00:04:16,950
It doesn't matter.

102
00:04:22,750 --> 00:04:24,560
Bring some meals and tea

103
00:04:24,560 --> 00:04:25,560
to my study tonight.

104
00:04:26,430 --> 00:04:27,160
Yes.

105
00:04:32,600 --> 00:04:33,270
What are you doing?

106
00:04:33,270 --> 00:04:34,800
You had an abortion tea?

107
00:04:35,040 --> 00:04:36,070
How did you know?

108
00:04:36,070 --> 00:04:37,270
Don't ask me that.

109
00:04:37,270 --> 00:04:39,120
How long were you planning to hide this?

110
00:04:39,120 --> 00:04:39,920
I...

111
00:04:43,480 --> 00:04:44,680
How much did you drink?

112
00:04:44,800 --> 00:04:45,390
It is

113
00:04:45,390 --> 00:04:47,480
just a cooling herb

114
00:04:47,480 --> 00:04:49,120
for someone not pregnant.

115
00:04:49,430 --> 00:04:50,800
It's harmless to me.

116
00:04:51,630 --> 00:04:52,560
Wait,

117
00:04:52,630 --> 00:04:54,040
how did you know?

118
00:04:55,950 --> 00:04:57,600
She played the victim in front of me,

119
00:04:57,920 --> 00:04:59,240
saying you falsely accused her

120
00:04:59,240 --> 00:05:00,680
of poisoning you.

121
00:05:01,190 --> 00:05:03,800
So First Madam truly is behind this.

122
00:05:04,070 --> 00:05:05,680
With no children of her own,

123
00:05:05,870 --> 00:05:07,240
she grows anxious.

124
00:05:07,600 --> 00:05:08,950
If I have an heir,

125
00:05:09,160 --> 00:05:11,310
it'll threaten her position.

126
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:13,830
Ms. Liu once asked

127
00:05:13,830 --> 00:05:15,950
if we'd let First Madamadopt our firstborn.

128
00:05:16,310 --> 00:05:18,830
Now she schemes to replace you

129
00:05:19,120 --> 00:05:20,920
by making Qiuyue my wife.

130
00:05:21,040 --> 00:05:23,560
Qiuyue must be coerced.

131
00:05:23,830 --> 00:05:25,120
She's a kind girl.

132
00:05:25,480 --> 00:05:27,070
She'd never harm me willingly.

133
00:05:28,120 --> 00:05:29,680
Leave her to me.

134
00:05:29,720 --> 00:05:31,680
Now that we know First Madam's game,

135
00:05:31,800 --> 00:05:33,000
I'll handle

136
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:34,070
the rest.

137
00:05:55,310 --> 00:05:57,040
I don't care who stands behind you,

138
00:05:57,680 --> 00:05:59,000
but if you harm Zhou Furong,

139
00:05:59,190 --> 00:06:00,190
no power can shield you.

140
00:06:00,950 --> 00:06:02,800
Only because she pleaded for you

141
00:06:03,040 --> 00:06:04,310
do I offer a choice.

142
00:06:05,040 --> 00:06:05,750
Leave

143
00:06:06,190 --> 00:06:07,800
voluntarily,

144
00:06:08,310 --> 00:06:09,160
or

145
00:06:11,310 --> 00:06:12,750
I'll make you disappear.

146
00:06:40,040 --> 00:06:41,040
Watch your step,

147
00:06:41,390 --> 00:06:42,720
clumsy girl.

148
00:06:43,360 --> 00:06:44,390
Listen carefully,

149
00:06:44,680 --> 00:06:46,750
Mr. Shen doesn't stray.

150
00:06:46,920 --> 00:06:49,390
He merely seeks
to secure the Shen lineage.

151
00:06:49,390 --> 00:06:50,950
That's why
he called Qiuyue to his study.

152
00:06:50,950 --> 00:06:52,720
Mr. Shen is seeing Quiyue in his study?

153
00:06:52,720 --> 00:06:54,480
If you dare spread anything about this,

154
00:06:54,750 --> 00:06:56,240
you'll regret it!

155
00:07:01,720 --> 00:07:02,430
Well?

156
00:07:03,310 --> 00:07:05,000
You've had enough time to decide.

157
00:07:05,680 --> 00:07:07,190
Ms. Liu should've lured

158
00:07:07,190 --> 00:07:09,070
Zhou Furong here by now.

159
00:07:09,920 --> 00:07:12,360
When I was drugged at the workshop,

160
00:07:12,870 --> 00:07:14,160
you saved me.

161
00:07:14,750 --> 00:07:16,800
Since that day,

162
00:07:17,390 --> 00:07:19,870
I've dreamed of becoming your woman.

163
00:07:20,270 --> 00:07:21,920
The one I wanted to save

164
00:07:21,950 --> 00:07:23,160
wasn't you.

165
00:07:23,680 --> 00:07:25,830
It was Su Yunqing,

166
00:07:26,360 --> 00:07:27,160
wasn't it?

167
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:30,870
After she fell comatose
and left the workshop,

168
00:07:30,950 --> 00:07:32,390
you never returned.

169
00:07:32,870 --> 00:07:34,000
That's when

170
00:07:34,830 --> 00:07:35,950
I knew.

171
00:07:36,390 --> 00:07:37,920
But I refused to accept it.

172
00:07:38,360 --> 00:07:39,480
I just don't get it!

173
00:07:39,600 --> 00:07:41,680
What's so good about her?

174
00:07:45,040 --> 00:07:46,950
You think these cheap tricks
could seduce me?

175
00:07:47,950 --> 00:07:49,430
How presumptuous!

176
00:07:51,950 --> 00:07:53,950
If that's what you think of me.

177
00:07:54,830 --> 00:07:56,070
But Mr. Shen,

178
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:58,120
you are

179
00:07:58,920 --> 00:08:00,190
a man after all.

180
00:08:02,870 --> 00:08:04,070
You're looking for trouble.

181
00:08:05,070 --> 00:08:06,800
Mr. Shen, stop!

182
00:08:07,120 --> 00:08:09,160
Mr. Shen, don't do this!

183
00:08:09,160 --> 00:08:10,240
Mr. Shen!

184
00:08:10,630 --> 00:08:12,390
Mr. Shen, please stop!

185
00:08:12,680 --> 00:08:14,390
Mr. Shen, let go of me!

186
00:08:14,750 --> 00:08:15,560
Mr. Shen!

187
00:08:15,720 --> 00:08:16,950
Please!

188
00:08:22,120 --> 00:08:23,160
Mrs. Shen,

189
00:08:24,040 --> 00:08:25,360
it's not what you think.

190
00:08:25,800 --> 00:08:27,000
It's a misunderstanding!

191
00:08:29,950 --> 00:08:31,000
Why are you here?

192
00:08:32,960 --> 00:08:35,030
I told him to test Qiuyue.

193
00:08:35,440 --> 00:08:36,910
Why should I be angry?

194
00:08:38,630 --> 00:08:39,390
Qiuyue,

195
00:08:40,240 --> 00:08:41,200
come with me.

196
00:08:42,030 --> 00:08:42,960
We need to talk.

197
00:08:57,240 --> 00:08:58,440
Mrs. Shen,

198
00:08:59,240 --> 00:09:00,200
I'm sorry.

199
00:09:00,320 --> 00:09:01,720
I realized my mistake.

200
00:09:02,790 --> 00:09:04,440
So his settlement

201
00:09:04,630 --> 00:09:06,080
was to give First Madam

202
00:09:06,080 --> 00:09:07,200
what she wanted, a child.

203
00:09:09,150 --> 00:09:10,030
Qiuyue,

204
00:09:11,030 --> 00:09:12,320
I'll be frank.

205
00:09:13,080 --> 00:09:14,550
I'm Su Yunqing.

206
00:09:17,910 --> 00:09:18,720
Mrs. Shen,

207
00:09:18,870 --> 00:09:20,240
don't joke like that.

208
00:09:22,840 --> 00:09:25,150
I know it sounds insane,

209
00:09:25,320 --> 00:09:27,120
but it's true.

210
00:09:27,840 --> 00:09:28,910
Impossible!

211
00:09:29,030 --> 00:09:30,000
How could someone

212
00:09:30,030 --> 00:09:32,200
become another person?

213
00:09:33,870 --> 00:09:34,840
I helped you

214
00:09:34,840 --> 00:09:36,600
make the Princess's hairpins

215
00:09:36,720 --> 00:09:38,480
and First Madam's headdress.

216
00:09:38,600 --> 00:09:40,120
To find who drugged you,

217
00:09:40,120 --> 00:09:41,720
I lured Second Madam into the open.

218
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:44,030
Yunqing?

219
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:46,000
It's really you.

220
00:09:46,080 --> 00:09:47,080
Yes.

221
00:09:55,080 --> 00:09:57,120
How did you take Zhou Furong's form?

222
00:09:58,150 --> 00:10:00,670
It's a bit complicated,

223
00:10:01,030 --> 00:10:02,120
but listen,

224
00:10:02,550 --> 00:10:05,150
Mr. Shen likely struck a deal

225
00:10:05,150 --> 00:10:07,030
with First Madam

226
00:10:07,750 --> 00:10:09,480
and then tried to make you pregnant.

227
00:10:10,240 --> 00:10:12,240
But once you deliver that baby,

228
00:10:12,480 --> 00:10:14,390
they'll discard you.

229
00:10:14,840 --> 00:10:16,000
Trust me,

230
00:10:16,120 --> 00:10:18,600
the Shen family's darker than you know.

231
00:10:19,120 --> 00:10:20,870
I won't let them use you.

232
00:10:21,360 --> 00:10:23,440
My patience wears thin.

233
00:10:23,750 --> 00:10:26,630
Remember, I hold your indenture papers.

234
00:10:27,270 --> 00:10:29,200
Disobey me,

235
00:10:29,600 --> 00:10:31,750
and you'll be sold to the brothels.

236
00:10:36,150 --> 00:10:37,000
Yunqing,

237
00:10:38,390 --> 00:10:39,390
I'm sorry.

238
00:10:41,840 --> 00:10:43,390
First Madam once said

239
00:10:43,720 --> 00:10:45,600
Zhou Furong tried to kill your sister

240
00:10:45,670 --> 00:10:47,480
to marry Mr. Shen.

241
00:10:47,480 --> 00:10:49,480
I wanted to avenge you,

242
00:10:49,480 --> 00:10:50,440
but...

243
00:10:50,600 --> 00:10:52,080
You've heard of my sister?

244
00:10:52,390 --> 00:10:53,630
What else?

245
00:10:54,630 --> 00:10:56,360
Rumors say

246
00:10:57,270 --> 00:10:58,360
she's kept

247
00:10:58,360 --> 00:11:00,870
at a Shen property outside town.

248
00:11:01,870 --> 00:11:02,910
Really?

249
00:11:03,240 --> 00:11:04,670
Do you know the location?

250
00:11:05,630 --> 00:11:07,030
But in your current form,

251
00:11:07,240 --> 00:11:08,840
could she even recognize you?

252
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:13,270
I just want to see her, even from afar.

253
00:11:14,600 --> 00:11:15,910
Can you take me there?

254
00:11:18,030 --> 00:11:19,600
Not now.

255
00:11:20,440 --> 00:11:22,550
Let me confirm the location first.

256
00:11:24,200 --> 00:11:25,440
I'll take you there later.

257
00:11:26,360 --> 00:11:27,080
Okay.

258
00:11:27,550 --> 00:11:28,670
Please hurry.

259
00:11:29,480 --> 00:11:30,550
Sure.

260
00:11:35,360 --> 00:11:36,720
[Shen Mansion]
You won't accompany me?

261
00:11:37,360 --> 00:11:38,440
I feel worried

262
00:11:38,630 --> 00:11:39,630
to leave you alone.

263
00:11:40,600 --> 00:11:42,870
What could happen at home?

264
00:11:44,270 --> 00:11:46,120
You shouldn't have kept her here.

265
00:11:46,240 --> 00:11:46,840
I'm worried...

266
00:11:46,840 --> 00:11:47,550
Don't be.

267
00:11:48,630 --> 00:11:50,200
I've grown wiser.

268
00:11:50,440 --> 00:11:51,440
Don't worry.

269
00:12:01,670 --> 00:12:02,550
Qiuyue,

270
00:12:03,440 --> 00:12:04,960
are you sure this is the place?

271
00:12:05,270 --> 00:12:06,390
No mistakes?

272
00:12:07,200 --> 00:12:08,150
Relax.

273
00:12:08,150 --> 00:12:09,150
Knowing you're Yunqing now,

274
00:12:09,150 --> 00:12:10,440
why would I harm you?

275
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:11,480
Right,

276
00:12:11,670 --> 00:12:12,440
she's over there.

277
00:12:12,440 --> 00:12:14,520
[Elegant Courtyard]

278
00:12:19,550 --> 00:12:20,320
Zhaohua?

279
00:12:21,550 --> 00:12:22,360
Zhaohua!

280
00:12:29,390 --> 00:12:30,270
Qiuyue?

281
00:12:31,030 --> 00:12:31,840
Qiuyue!

282
00:12:32,030 --> 00:12:32,720
Qiuyue!

283
00:12:34,270 --> 00:12:35,240
Who are you?

284
00:12:35,390 --> 00:12:36,200
What do you want?
