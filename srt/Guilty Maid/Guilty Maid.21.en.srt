00:00:06,040 --> 00:00:10,120
[Guilty Maid]
[Episode 21]

2
00:00:11,150 --> 00:00:13,360
Madam, where are you going?

3
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:15,840
You...

4
00:00:16,840 --> 00:00:19,320
You've actually been bought off
by that wretched girl?

5
00:00:20,110 --> 00:00:20,910
Her?

6
00:00:21,160 --> 00:00:22,200
No, no.

7
00:00:22,270 --> 00:00:23,480
You'll all pay with your lives.

8
00:00:23,800 --> 00:00:24,320
You...

9
00:00:24,750 --> 00:00:26,320
You betrayed me?

10
00:00:26,960 --> 00:00:28,270
Lurking beside you

11
00:00:28,270 --> 00:00:29,960
was my mission.

12
00:00:30,110 --> 00:00:31,840
How could it be betrayal?

13
00:00:32,880 --> 00:00:34,000
Lurking?

14
00:00:35,360 --> 00:00:36,390
Never

15
00:00:36,390 --> 00:00:37,510
underestimate Qiuyue.

16
00:00:37,830 --> 00:00:39,360
If she can get you into the yamen once,

17
00:00:39,360 --> 00:00:40,960
she can do it again and again.

18
00:00:41,360 --> 00:00:42,640
Keeping her in the mansion

19
00:00:43,240 --> 00:00:44,390
is asking for trouble.

20
00:00:45,040 --> 00:00:46,430
Are you saying

21
00:00:47,040 --> 00:00:49,000
she deliberately knocked over
my carriage

22
00:00:49,390 --> 00:00:51,750
to expose the Master's death?

23
00:00:52,600 --> 00:00:56,280
And then spread the news

24
00:00:57,390 --> 00:00:59,640
to get me into the yamen?

25
00:00:59,750 --> 00:01:00,680
Absolutely.

26
00:01:01,280 --> 00:01:02,920
You've only been in there a few days,

27
00:01:03,510 --> 00:01:06,390
and the Second Madam has uncovered
those secret accounts.

28
00:01:07,040 --> 00:01:08,240
I'd wager

29
00:01:08,240 --> 00:01:10,830
those were their own fabricated records,

30
00:01:11,080 --> 00:01:12,630
just a scheme

31
00:01:12,680 --> 00:01:13,910
to transfer assets.

32
00:01:16,190 --> 00:01:18,520
She's already Xingyan's concubine.

33
00:01:19,350 --> 00:01:20,270
This

34
00:01:20,470 --> 00:01:21,990
requires careful planning.

35
00:01:22,880 --> 00:01:23,320
But you see...

36
00:01:23,320 --> 00:01:23,680
Enough.

37
00:01:23,680 --> 00:01:24,440
Not another word.

38
00:01:25,110 --> 00:01:26,390
If anyone dares embezzle

39
00:01:26,390 --> 00:01:27,800
the Shen family's assets,

40
00:01:29,350 --> 00:01:30,830
I won't show mercy.

41
00:01:36,190 --> 00:01:37,720
You're working for the Third Madam?

42
00:01:37,830 --> 00:01:39,320
Too late for you to realize.

43
00:01:41,990 --> 00:01:43,240
You think you can escape?

44
00:01:55,600 --> 00:01:57,320
I've always treated you well, haven't I?

45
00:01:57,320 --> 00:01:58,600
Please don't kill me.

46
00:01:58,800 --> 00:02:00,040
I'll give you money.

47
00:02:00,080 --> 00:02:01,390
I can pay more than her, I swear.

48
00:02:01,440 --> 00:02:02,600
Just name your price.

49
00:02:03,190 --> 00:02:05,040
You think money fixes everything?

50
00:02:05,830 --> 00:02:07,680
How will you repay
my sister Shumeng's life?

51
00:02:07,680 --> 00:02:08,070
It was

52
00:02:08,400 --> 00:02:09,440
Qiuyue...

53
00:02:11,040 --> 00:02:13,440
The Shen family treats lives like dirt.

54
00:02:13,440 --> 00:02:15,950
Your indulgence enabled it all.

55
00:02:27,510 --> 00:02:28,400
Miss Su,

56
00:02:28,400 --> 00:02:29,470
are you alright?

57
00:02:32,350 --> 00:02:33,400
You recognize me?

58
00:02:34,120 --> 00:02:35,470
I've always known who you were.

59
00:02:35,750 --> 00:02:36,840
Mr. Shen

60
00:02:37,160 --> 00:02:38,040
tasked me long ago

61
00:02:38,040 --> 00:02:39,190
with finding you.

62
00:02:39,790 --> 00:02:40,880
Miss Su, do you remember

63
00:02:41,280 --> 00:02:42,070
saving a young man

64
00:02:42,280 --> 00:02:44,120
by the southern lakeside five years ago?

65
00:02:45,600 --> 00:02:46,720
Five years ago?

66
00:02:49,070 --> 00:02:49,790
It's no use.

67
00:02:50,790 --> 00:02:52,000
Too late.

68
00:02:52,720 --> 00:02:54,880
An ordinary physician
might be powerless.

69
00:02:55,190 --> 00:02:56,790
But the Su family has a method.

70
00:02:57,350 --> 00:02:58,670
Exchange of blood.

71
00:02:59,790 --> 00:03:01,600
If our blood repels each other,

72
00:03:01,600 --> 00:03:02,070
you will die.

73
00:03:02,670 --> 00:03:03,510
Dare you try?

74
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:06,470
It's come to this.

75
00:03:07,720 --> 00:03:09,120
What do I have to fear?

76
00:03:10,670 --> 00:03:11,910
Close your eyes.

77
00:03:21,280 --> 00:03:22,040
You're

78
00:03:23,320 --> 00:03:24,720
the young lady of the Su family?

79
00:03:25,320 --> 00:03:25,840
Who...

80
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:27,160
Who allowed you to peek?

81
00:03:29,440 --> 00:03:30,630
So it was him

82
00:03:32,280 --> 00:03:33,230
back then?

83
00:03:33,670 --> 00:03:35,320
Mr. Shen truly cares for you.

84
00:03:35,880 --> 00:03:37,470
I've never seen him treat any woman

85
00:03:37,630 --> 00:03:38,670
this way.

86
00:03:39,840 --> 00:03:40,880
Give it up.

87
00:03:40,880 --> 00:03:42,000
You can't escape.

88
00:03:42,790 --> 00:03:43,840
Miss Su,

89
00:03:43,910 --> 00:03:45,190
run south.

90
00:03:56,160 --> 00:03:57,280
I've come this far.

91
00:03:57,790 --> 00:03:59,510
Seems I'm not far from the Shen mansion.

92
00:04:00,040 --> 00:04:01,230
I should be safe now.

93
00:04:15,160 --> 00:04:16,720
Stop right there!

94
00:04:16,820 --> 00:04:18,840
I was supposed to collect three bodies,

95
00:04:18,960 --> 00:04:20,760
but I didn't expect you

96
00:04:20,790 --> 00:04:22,080
to escape.

97
00:04:22,760 --> 00:04:25,430
The more you resist,
the more fun I'll have.

98
00:04:25,430 --> 00:04:27,720
Why won't you even spare me?

99
00:04:28,400 --> 00:04:30,400
Blame it on your cleverness.

100
00:04:31,430 --> 00:04:33,720
You traced the secret accounts
to the Third Madam,

101
00:04:33,790 --> 00:04:34,720
forcing her

102
00:04:34,720 --> 00:04:37,110
to poison Su Zhaohua to silence her.

103
00:04:37,350 --> 00:04:39,430
Then you figured out
the poisoning method.

104
00:04:39,470 --> 00:04:41,180
If someone deserves to die,

105
00:04:41,180 --> 00:04:42,580
it's you.

106
00:04:43,500 --> 00:04:44,380
You don't even know

107
00:04:44,380 --> 00:04:45,380
Su Zhaohua's body

108
00:04:45,740 --> 00:04:47,420
has been stolen, do you?

109
00:04:47,860 --> 00:04:48,660
What did you say?

110
00:04:49,180 --> 00:04:51,620
If evidence of the poisoning is found,

111
00:04:51,780 --> 00:04:53,660
the Third Madam won't last long either!

112
00:04:55,300 --> 00:04:56,260
Still defiant

113
00:04:56,260 --> 00:04:58,100
even at death's door?

114
00:04:58,580 --> 00:04:59,740
If I die,

115
00:04:59,900 --> 00:05:01,020
you'll never know

116
00:05:01,020 --> 00:05:02,860
where Su Zhaohua's body is.

117
00:05:03,580 --> 00:05:04,300
Spill it!

118
00:05:04,300 --> 00:05:04,980
Where is it?

119
00:05:05,420 --> 00:05:06,900
Who's investigating the Third Madam?

120
00:05:07,140 --> 00:05:08,060
Let me go.

121
00:05:08,100 --> 00:05:09,300
I'll take you there.

122
00:05:11,940 --> 00:05:13,900
Don't you dare try any tricks on me.

123
00:05:13,900 --> 00:05:14,500
You!

124
00:05:16,380 --> 00:05:17,060
Then

125
00:05:17,620 --> 00:05:19,820
wait to face justice.

126
00:05:26,780 --> 00:05:28,260
You infuriate me.

127
00:05:30,940 --> 00:05:31,980
If you confess

128
00:05:32,100 --> 00:05:32,980
and contribute,

129
00:05:33,420 --> 00:05:34,900
I'll spare your life.

130
00:05:40,900 --> 00:05:42,260
If Wei Xian is here,

131
00:05:42,820 --> 00:05:44,340
I might have a chance of survival.

132
00:05:44,860 --> 00:05:45,900
But if he's not,

133
00:05:46,900 --> 00:05:48,860
I fear this night will be my last.

134
00:05:51,260 --> 00:05:52,940
Are you sure the body is here?

135
00:05:53,100 --> 00:05:54,180
Absolutely.

136
00:05:54,780 --> 00:05:55,740
Take me inside now.

137
00:05:58,420 --> 00:05:59,140
Wei Xian,

138
00:05:59,740 --> 00:06:01,580
the murderer
of the Fourth Madam is here.

139
00:06:01,580 --> 00:06:02,340
Wei Xian!

140
00:06:02,380 --> 00:06:03,500
You wretch!

141
00:06:03,620 --> 00:06:05,860
The true owner
of the jade pendant is here,

142
00:06:05,860 --> 00:06:06,740
Wei Xian!

143
00:06:06,900 --> 00:06:08,060
Come out and take your revenge,

144
00:06:08,060 --> 00:06:08,820
Wei Xian!

145
00:06:10,460 --> 00:06:11,820
You wretch!

146
00:06:11,980 --> 00:06:12,940
How dare you trick me?

147
00:06:12,940 --> 00:06:13,500
Wei Xian!

148
00:06:14,260 --> 00:06:14,740
Wei Xian,

149
00:06:14,820 --> 00:06:15,980
come out and take your revenge!

150
00:06:15,980 --> 00:06:16,580
Wei Xian!

151
00:06:16,580 --> 00:06:18,540
I'll strangle you to death.

152
00:06:23,140 --> 00:06:24,820
I'll strangle you.

153
00:06:24,980 --> 00:06:26,660
Go to heck!

154
00:06:29,940 --> 00:06:32,300
Go to heck!

155
00:07:12,420 --> 00:07:13,380
So

156
00:07:14,220 --> 00:07:15,740
I've really become Ms. Rong.
