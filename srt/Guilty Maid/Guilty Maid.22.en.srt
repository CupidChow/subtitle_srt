00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:10,080
[Guilty Maid]
[Episode 22]

2
00:00:20,190 --> 00:00:22,550
Qingqiu persuaded me not to take action.

3
00:00:24,230 --> 00:00:24,870
I never expected you

4
00:00:25,600 --> 00:00:27,190
to come to me on your own.

5
00:00:28,550 --> 00:00:28,870
No.

6
00:00:29,710 --> 00:00:30,280
Wei Xian,

7
00:00:31,120 --> 00:00:32,750
I didn't kill the Fourth Madam's child.

8
00:00:33,240 --> 00:00:34,200
I'm Liuli,

9
00:00:34,790 --> 00:00:37,200
and also Qiuyue
who just called you out earlier.

10
00:00:37,470 --> 00:00:38,840
In short, I am not your enemy.

11
00:00:38,840 --> 00:00:40,110
So you fear death too.

12
00:00:40,200 --> 00:00:40,790
Are you

13
00:00:41,240 --> 00:00:42,560
babbling nonsense before you die?

14
00:00:42,750 --> 00:00:43,710
I truly am Liuli.

15
00:00:44,240 --> 00:00:45,350
You kidnapped me once before.

16
00:00:46,390 --> 00:00:47,670
You want to kill Liuli

17
00:00:47,880 --> 00:00:49,150
because of the Fourth Madam's child.

18
00:00:49,430 --> 00:00:50,110
You said you and Qingqiu...

19
00:00:50,110 --> 00:00:50,790
Silence!

20
00:00:51,280 --> 00:00:53,390
You harmed Qingqiu
and the child she cherished most.

21
00:00:53,430 --> 00:00:55,000
You don't deserve to live!

22
00:00:57,320 --> 00:00:58,430
I can prove it.

23
00:00:58,790 --> 00:00:59,670
Back then,

24
00:00:59,710 --> 00:01:01,240
you kept a rabbit cage there.

25
00:01:01,640 --> 00:01:03,640
My ropes were gnawed through by rabbits.

26
00:01:04,150 --> 00:01:05,310
If I were Ms. Rong,

27
00:01:05,480 --> 00:01:06,710
I couldn't have known that.

28
00:01:08,120 --> 00:01:08,400
Now that

29
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:09,680
the First Madam is dead,

30
00:01:10,040 --> 00:01:11,790
you'll target the Third Madam next.

31
00:01:11,840 --> 00:01:13,120
Only if I live

32
00:01:13,120 --> 00:01:15,070
can I expose all of her crimes.

33
00:01:15,760 --> 00:01:16,120
Otherwise,

34
00:01:16,590 --> 00:01:18,070
with mere evidence of her usury,

35
00:01:18,150 --> 00:01:19,590
she'd face at most
a few years in prison.

36
00:01:19,710 --> 00:01:20,590
You're lying to me!

37
00:01:23,230 --> 00:01:24,350
I'm not.

38
00:01:24,870 --> 00:01:26,710
I can work with the Fourth Madam.

39
00:01:27,070 --> 00:01:28,640
Haven't you endured all this time
in the Shen family

40
00:01:28,920 --> 00:01:30,400
just for revenge?

41
00:01:30,710 --> 00:01:32,400
Would you let one moment of impulse

42
00:01:32,640 --> 00:01:34,680
destroy years of planning?

43
00:01:43,640 --> 00:01:45,280
With a face like yours,

44
00:01:45,590 --> 00:01:47,950
it's hard to believe
you're not Ms. Rong.

45
00:01:48,640 --> 00:01:50,840
Yet you know
about my dealings with Liuli

46
00:01:50,920 --> 00:01:53,070
and my secret deal with Qiuyue.

47
00:01:54,840 --> 00:01:57,350
Madam, I know this seems unbelievable.

48
00:01:58,040 --> 00:01:58,400
But

49
00:01:58,680 --> 00:02:00,200
it's the truth.

50
00:02:00,640 --> 00:02:01,870
In my current position,

51
00:02:01,920 --> 00:02:03,680
I can freely approach the Third Madam

52
00:02:04,120 --> 00:02:05,920
and uncover more evidence for you.

53
00:02:06,400 --> 00:02:07,710
According to the law,

54
00:02:07,950 --> 00:02:09,150
a murder conviction

55
00:02:09,280 --> 00:02:09,590
requires evidence from

56
00:02:09,590 --> 00:02:09,960
the body,

57
00:02:10,120 --> 00:02:10,470
injuries,

58
00:02:10,710 --> 00:02:11,000
illness records,

59
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:11,240
physical objects,

60
00:02:11,240 --> 00:02:11,430
and crime traces.

61
00:02:11,470 --> 00:02:12,560
All are essential.

62
00:02:12,800 --> 00:02:13,240
Thus,

63
00:02:13,800 --> 00:02:15,000
to convict the Third Madam,

64
00:02:15,430 --> 00:02:16,840
we need more evidence.

65
00:02:18,710 --> 00:02:19,680
You're right.

66
00:02:21,030 --> 00:02:23,120
Her usury alone isn't a capital offense.

67
00:02:23,910 --> 00:02:26,080
And she didn't commit murder herself.

68
00:02:26,150 --> 00:02:27,590
We still need evidence.

69
00:02:28,430 --> 00:02:30,030
But why would you help me?

70
00:02:30,750 --> 00:02:32,150
The Third Madam

71
00:02:32,150 --> 00:02:33,630
poisoned my sister, after all.

72
00:02:34,190 --> 00:02:35,750
Though she wasn't kind,

73
00:02:36,310 --> 00:02:37,560
she didn't deserve to die.

74
00:02:38,430 --> 00:02:38,870
And

75
00:02:39,590 --> 00:02:40,840
with my current face,

76
00:02:41,400 --> 00:02:41,870
Wei Xian

77
00:02:42,280 --> 00:02:43,630
will surely kill me for revenge.

78
00:02:44,470 --> 00:02:45,150
Madam,

79
00:02:46,310 --> 00:02:47,190
I want to live.

80
00:02:51,680 --> 00:02:52,030
Fine.

81
00:02:52,630 --> 00:02:54,080
I can work with you.

82
00:02:54,680 --> 00:02:55,240
But

83
00:02:55,430 --> 00:02:56,590
I have one condition.

84
00:03:08,310 --> 00:03:10,560
Madam, why did you bring me
to Mr. Shen's place?

85
00:03:11,280 --> 00:03:12,280
You said it yourself.

86
00:03:12,310 --> 00:03:13,840
Xingyan had always wanted to
marry Cuiqiao,

87
00:03:13,870 --> 00:03:14,680
Zhou Furong,

88
00:03:14,710 --> 00:03:15,910
and even Qiuyue,

89
00:03:15,910 --> 00:03:16,590
but in fact,

90
00:03:16,630 --> 00:03:18,310
it has only ever been you.

91
00:03:18,840 --> 00:03:20,430
So go tell him who you are.

92
00:03:20,630 --> 00:03:21,870
Tell him everything.

93
00:03:21,910 --> 00:03:23,400
I need his help.

94
00:03:23,870 --> 00:03:24,470
No.

95
00:03:25,360 --> 00:03:26,840
I can't reveal myself to him.

96
00:03:27,190 --> 00:03:28,840
At my age and with this face,

97
00:03:28,840 --> 00:03:30,360
I could be his mother.

98
00:03:30,590 --> 00:03:32,310
How could we possibly be together?

99
00:03:32,750 --> 00:03:34,080
What are you afraid of?

100
00:03:34,280 --> 00:03:36,150
Is it his reputation or yours?

101
00:03:37,870 --> 00:03:39,910
How would you describe my face?

102
00:03:41,280 --> 00:03:42,310
Youthful,

103
00:03:42,310 --> 00:03:43,240
and stunningly beautiful.

104
00:03:43,590 --> 00:03:44,840
Youthful?

105
00:03:44,910 --> 00:03:47,430
Yet I became some old man's concubine!

106
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:49,120
Tell me,

107
00:03:49,190 --> 00:03:50,400
why is it

108
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:53,030
perfectly natural for an old man
to marry a young woman,

109
00:03:53,030 --> 00:03:56,120
but the world recoils
when the roles are reversed?

110
00:03:56,910 --> 00:03:57,840
Besides,

111
00:03:58,840 --> 00:04:01,560
who's to say Shen Xingyan
wouldn't accept you

112
00:04:01,560 --> 00:04:02,680
as you are now?

113
00:04:06,750 --> 00:04:07,280
Xingyan?

114
00:04:07,960 --> 00:04:08,960
Xingyan's in trouble.

115
00:04:09,280 --> 00:04:09,910
Xingyan!

116
00:04:14,190 --> 00:04:15,870
So she really is Su Yunqing.

117
00:04:17,430 --> 00:04:18,310
Such

118
00:04:18,630 --> 00:04:20,310
a bizarre thing.

119
00:04:23,800 --> 00:04:25,920
If anything happens to Qiuyue,

120
00:04:26,560 --> 00:04:28,270
I'll make you pay.

121
00:04:29,070 --> 00:04:29,870
Let him go.

122
00:04:32,630 --> 00:04:33,830
That girl has escaped.

123
00:04:34,040 --> 00:04:35,040
He saw it too.

124
00:04:36,240 --> 00:04:37,390
Who hired you?

125
00:04:38,190 --> 00:04:39,070
Was it Ms. Rong

126
00:04:39,630 --> 00:04:40,800
or

127
00:04:41,360 --> 00:04:42,310
the Third Madam?

128
00:04:44,190 --> 00:04:45,680
The Third Madam is just a decoy.

129
00:04:46,870 --> 00:04:48,950
My sister died a cruel death here.

130
00:04:49,070 --> 00:04:50,390
And you didn't report it
to the authorities.

131
00:04:50,480 --> 00:04:52,560
I have no choice but to avenge her.

132
00:04:54,800 --> 00:04:55,600
Xingyan!

133
00:04:58,240 --> 00:04:59,040
Xingyan!

134
00:04:59,240 --> 00:04:59,920
Xingyan.

135
00:05:04,430 --> 00:05:06,270
You grow more insolent by the day.

136
00:05:07,630 --> 00:05:08,870
Mr. Shen, please forgive me.

137
00:05:09,160 --> 00:05:11,270
I heard some commotion here

138
00:05:11,390 --> 00:05:13,390
and felt worried about your safety.

139
00:05:14,310 --> 00:05:15,390
I'm glad you're all right.

140
00:05:16,160 --> 00:05:17,040
I'll take my leave now.

141
00:05:17,040 --> 00:05:17,720
Wait.

142
00:05:27,310 --> 00:05:29,270
Is it a place where you can come and go

143
00:05:29,800 --> 00:05:31,000
as you please?

144
00:05:32,040 --> 00:05:33,680
What are your orders, Mr. Shen?

145
00:05:34,430 --> 00:05:35,830
Where is Qiuyue now?

146
00:05:37,190 --> 00:05:38,480
I know the Third Madam

147
00:05:39,160 --> 00:05:41,920
must be involved in this matter.

148
00:05:42,750 --> 00:05:43,950
Tell me,

149
00:05:44,560 --> 00:05:46,750
and I might spare you.

150
00:05:47,390 --> 00:05:48,190
Xingyan,

151
00:05:49,120 --> 00:05:51,070
forgive me for not revealing myself.

152
00:05:52,950 --> 00:05:53,720
Speak up!

153
00:05:54,190 --> 00:05:56,430
Don't think your seniority
in the Shen family

154
00:05:56,870 --> 00:05:58,040
makes you untouchable.

155
00:06:00,270 --> 00:06:01,560
Mr. Shen,

156
00:06:03,190 --> 00:06:05,240
Qiuyue is no longer alive.

157
00:06:06,160 --> 00:06:07,160
What did you say?

158
00:06:08,190 --> 00:06:09,120
You're lying.

159
00:06:21,600 --> 00:06:22,480
Are you

160
00:06:23,480 --> 00:06:24,270
telling the truth?

161
00:06:26,070 --> 00:06:27,720
Absolutely true.

162
00:06:42,190 --> 00:06:43,480
Where is she now?

163
00:06:45,680 --> 00:06:47,240
At Wei Xian's place.

164
00:06:50,560 --> 00:06:51,480
You're lying to me.

165
00:06:56,750 --> 00:06:58,160
You're lying, aren't you?

166
00:07:00,560 --> 00:07:03,190
Mr. Shen, I know this is hard to accept.

167
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:06,950
But the dead cannot return.

168
00:07:08,040 --> 00:07:10,070
I'm sorry for your loss.

169
00:07:11,480 --> 00:07:12,390
Yunqing.

170
00:07:15,630 --> 00:07:17,480
If you dare deceive me,

171
00:07:18,430 --> 00:07:20,510
I'll kill you.

172
00:07:46,680 --> 00:07:48,630
To meet would only
sharpen sorrow's blade.

173
00:07:49,600 --> 00:07:51,750
Better the cold grace of indifference.

174
00:07:53,240 --> 00:07:54,070
Xingyan,

175
00:07:55,830 --> 00:07:57,390
please forgive me.

176
00:07:58,480 --> 00:08:01,430
I really don't know how to face you.

177
00:08:02,630 --> 00:08:04,000
If our reunion

178
00:08:04,680 --> 00:08:06,680
would bring even greater pain,

179
00:08:08,040 --> 00:08:09,040
then

180
00:08:10,040 --> 00:08:11,360
let Su Yunqing

181
00:08:12,920 --> 00:08:14,120
vanish from this world

182
00:08:17,750 --> 00:08:20,560
forever.

183
00:08:39,030 --> 00:08:40,150
What's going on with you all?

184
00:08:40,550 --> 00:08:41,080
Why haven't I

185
00:08:41,150 --> 00:08:42,440
heard from you these past few days?

186
00:08:43,030 --> 00:08:44,600
There were complications.

187
00:08:44,720 --> 00:08:46,750
The First Madam
had poison and a dagger with her.

188
00:08:47,270 --> 00:08:48,870
The assassin was also injured.

189
00:08:49,360 --> 00:08:50,600
But rest assured, Madam.

190
00:08:51,080 --> 00:08:52,200
It's been handled.

191
00:08:53,390 --> 00:08:54,440
That's good.

192
00:08:55,360 --> 00:08:56,150
I've been

193
00:08:56,150 --> 00:08:57,720
on tenterhooks these past few days.

194
00:09:09,400 --> 00:09:10,240
[One Hundred Taels]

195
00:09:10,240 --> 00:09:11,600
[Account Book]

196
00:09:13,780 --> 00:09:15,020
Give him five hundred taels.

197
00:09:15,340 --> 00:09:16,300
For such a big matter,

198
00:09:16,300 --> 00:09:17,540
we'll satisfy him.

199
00:09:18,700 --> 00:09:19,460
Then

200
00:09:19,700 --> 00:09:20,980
what about the Fourth Madam?

201
00:09:22,180 --> 00:09:23,340
The First Madam is dead.

202
00:09:24,020 --> 00:09:25,700
Now the financial power
over the workshop

203
00:09:25,740 --> 00:09:27,060
has fallen into my hands.

204
00:09:27,860 --> 00:09:29,420
I don't think she and the Second Madam

205
00:09:29,540 --> 00:09:31,220
can stir up any trouble.

206
00:09:32,020 --> 00:09:34,060
And she thought that forcing me
to kill the First Madam

207
00:09:34,060 --> 00:09:35,140
would leave her some leverage.

208
00:09:35,420 --> 00:09:36,460
How ridiculous.

209
00:09:39,940 --> 00:09:41,900
Has everything been cleaned up?

210
00:09:43,100 --> 00:09:43,820
Yes.

211
00:09:43,820 --> 00:09:45,140
Every trace eliminated.

212
00:09:57,580 --> 00:09:58,380
Madam,

213
00:09:58,900 --> 00:10:00,380
you've been so bothered
by the Shen family's affairs

214
00:10:00,380 --> 00:10:02,060
that you can't eat or sleep well.

215
00:10:02,420 --> 00:10:03,780
I had the kitchen prepare

216
00:10:03,780 --> 00:10:05,780
white fungus
and Chinese Forest Frog stew.

217
00:10:06,180 --> 00:10:07,420
It can help you sleep.

218
00:10:07,700 --> 00:10:08,980
You're so thoughtful, Ms. Rong.

219
00:10:09,220 --> 00:10:10,460
Drink it while it's warm.

220
00:10:25,420 --> 00:10:27,140
I'll take my leave.

221
00:10:39,420 --> 00:10:40,780
Are you sure you saw clearly?

222
00:10:42,140 --> 00:10:43,060
She went to the Fourth Madam's

223
00:10:43,140 --> 00:10:43,900
place first upon returning?

224
00:10:43,900 --> 00:10:44,700
Last night,

225
00:10:44,700 --> 00:10:46,380
I saw her go to the Fourth Madam's place

226
00:10:46,380 --> 00:10:47,940
with a man.

227
00:10:50,900 --> 00:10:52,460
Take this bowl of stuff for testing.

228
00:10:52,940 --> 00:10:53,540
I'd like to see

229
00:10:53,740 --> 00:10:55,180
what she's up to.

230
00:10:55,300 --> 00:10:55,820
Yes.

231
00:11:14,540 --> 00:11:15,140
Madam.

232
00:11:34,020 --> 00:11:35,140
Ms. Rong,

233
00:11:35,140 --> 00:11:36,540
what are you doing?
