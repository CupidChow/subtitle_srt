[Guilty Maid]
[Episode 17]

2
00:00:10,380 --> 00:00:11,240
Tell us,

3
00:00:12,100 --> 00:00:13,880
who put you up to this?

4
00:00:15,580 --> 00:00:16,650
Mr. Shen,

5
00:00:16,780 --> 00:00:18,280
the Master's death was no accident.

6
00:00:18,340 --> 00:00:19,600
It was murder.

7
00:00:19,940 --> 00:00:21,600
You insolent wench.

8
00:00:21,740 --> 00:00:23,180
How dare you spout such lies

9
00:00:23,220 --> 00:00:24,880
with death at your doorstep!

10
00:00:25,300 --> 00:00:26,400
Mr. Shen,

11
00:00:26,620 --> 00:00:28,760
there are still many doubts.

12
00:00:29,020 --> 00:00:30,650
When exactly did he
return to the mansion?

13
00:00:31,020 --> 00:00:33,140
Why would he venture out at night
with the First Madam?

14
00:00:33,140 --> 00:00:33,980
Why was there no struggle

15
00:00:34,100 --> 00:00:35,900
or cries for help when he drowned?

16
00:00:36,300 --> 00:00:37,180
Most importantly,

17
00:00:37,180 --> 00:00:37,820
was it

18
00:00:37,820 --> 00:00:39,200
truly an accident or murder?

19
00:00:39,540 --> 00:00:41,010
Once these questions are answered,

20
00:00:41,340 --> 00:00:43,050
you may punish me at your leisure.

21
00:00:44,700 --> 00:00:46,120
Whoever tries to
obstruct the investigation

22
00:00:46,500 --> 00:00:48,400
must be concealing the truth!

23
00:00:50,580 --> 00:00:51,290
First Madam,

24
00:00:51,580 --> 00:00:52,700
I believe

25
00:00:52,700 --> 00:00:53,460
we must report this

26
00:00:53,460 --> 00:00:54,480
to the authorities.

27
00:00:55,180 --> 00:00:57,080
If we just beat Qiuyue to death,

28
00:00:57,380 --> 00:00:58,520
when the authorities inquire later,

29
00:00:58,860 --> 00:01:00,330
we won't be able to explain ourselves.

30
00:01:00,500 --> 00:01:01,200
First Madam,

31
00:01:01,660 --> 00:01:03,580
let's report this to the authorities.

32
00:01:03,580 --> 00:01:06,220
We must find who murdered the Master.

33
00:01:07,060 --> 00:01:08,640
The law stipulates

34
00:01:09,020 --> 00:01:10,940
that children must observe

35
00:01:10,940 --> 00:01:12,860
three years of mourning
upon a parent's death,

36
00:01:13,540 --> 00:01:16,000
during which all imperial examinations
are forbidden.

37
00:01:16,620 --> 00:01:18,220
If we report this,

38
00:01:18,220 --> 00:01:19,300
Xingyan cannot

39
00:01:19,300 --> 00:01:21,000
sit for the imperial examination
for three years.

40
00:01:21,780 --> 00:01:23,140
How many three-year spans
does he have?

41
00:01:23,140 --> 00:01:25,090
How many do any of us possess?

42
00:01:27,260 --> 00:01:29,060
We must avoid official involvement.

43
00:01:29,260 --> 00:01:30,000
First Madam,

44
00:01:30,860 --> 00:01:32,810
let's bury the Master.

45
00:01:34,060 --> 00:01:35,700
It seems we have no better choice.

46
00:01:35,700 --> 00:01:36,280
Proceed with the burial.

47
00:01:37,420 --> 00:01:39,120
Concealing a death
is a far greater crime!

48
00:01:39,340 --> 00:01:40,020
If it is discovered,

49
00:01:40,020 --> 00:01:41,780
the penalty exceeds
mere three years' prohibition.

50
00:01:42,300 --> 00:01:44,380
It means lifetime disqualification
from office,

51
00:01:44,380 --> 00:01:45,460
likely ending up exiled to the frontier

52
00:01:45,460 --> 00:01:46,420
or imprisoned.

53
00:01:47,700 --> 00:01:49,200
You wretch!

54
00:01:50,540 --> 00:01:52,220
The Shen family affairs

55
00:01:52,220 --> 00:01:53,340
are none of your business!

56
00:01:53,340 --> 00:01:54,200
Enough, mother.

57
00:01:54,700 --> 00:01:55,890
There's no use hiding it any longer.

58
00:01:57,300 --> 00:01:58,970
I want no part in court intrigues.

59
00:01:59,780 --> 00:02:01,200
So I never sat
for the imperial examination.

60
00:02:01,740 --> 00:02:02,560
Xingyan,

61
00:02:03,260 --> 00:02:04,780
are you telling the truth?

62
00:02:06,260 --> 00:02:07,360
Yes, Madam.

63
00:02:10,220 --> 00:02:10,900
Alright.

64
00:02:11,820 --> 00:02:13,700
It seems fate has decreed

65
00:02:13,700 --> 00:02:15,200
this calamity upon the Shen family.

66
00:02:15,940 --> 00:02:17,260
The Master is dead.

67
00:02:17,340 --> 00:02:19,180
From now on, all household affairs

68
00:02:19,180 --> 00:02:21,020
fall to you.

69
00:02:21,900 --> 00:02:22,700
Reporting

70
00:02:22,700 --> 00:02:23,900
is a serious matter.

71
00:02:24,140 --> 00:02:25,360
Let me think it over.

72
00:02:26,060 --> 00:02:26,820
And,

73
00:02:27,060 --> 00:02:28,800
you must keep it a strict secret.

74
00:02:29,140 --> 00:02:31,460
If any of you breathe a word of this,

75
00:02:31,460 --> 00:02:33,640
you will be cast out.

76
00:02:47,460 --> 00:02:48,760
Trying to buy time?

77
00:02:51,180 --> 00:02:52,480
Not that easy.

78
00:02:55,180 --> 00:02:55,780
Mr. Shen,

79
00:02:55,780 --> 00:02:56,420
something's wrong.

80
00:02:56,580 --> 00:02:57,820
Zhou Furong has also fainted.

81
00:02:57,820 --> 00:02:59,420
Just like the other girls,

82
00:02:59,420 --> 00:03:00,300
she's in a coma.

83
00:03:01,860 --> 00:03:03,800
Of all times.

84
00:03:04,940 --> 00:03:05,980
Search now!

85
00:03:06,460 --> 00:03:07,080
Understood.

86
00:03:15,580 --> 00:03:17,010
I'll give you one more chance.

87
00:03:17,580 --> 00:03:18,130
Tell me,

88
00:03:18,540 --> 00:03:20,290
who put you up to this?

89
00:03:20,940 --> 00:03:22,260
No one.

90
00:03:22,780 --> 00:03:24,520
I didn't kill your father.

91
00:03:25,140 --> 00:03:27,050
Still defiant even with death
at your doorstep!

92
00:03:27,500 --> 00:03:29,300
It really wasn't me.

93
00:03:32,900 --> 00:03:35,080
If I find out you're the murderer,

94
00:03:35,540 --> 00:03:37,050
you'll pay dearly.

95
00:03:43,460 --> 00:03:44,240
From now on,

96
00:03:45,100 --> 00:03:46,730
you do not leave my sight.

97
00:03:54,940 --> 00:03:55,980
Shen Xingyan,

98
00:03:56,700 --> 00:03:58,800
our feud will be settled later.

99
00:03:59,380 --> 00:04:00,980
For now, I need to find a way

100
00:04:00,980 --> 00:04:02,540
to clear my name.

101
00:04:04,540 --> 00:04:04,900
Madam,

102
00:04:04,900 --> 00:04:05,540
disaster.

103
00:04:05,700 --> 00:04:06,100
The Chen,

104
00:04:06,100 --> 00:04:06,420
Li,

105
00:04:06,420 --> 00:04:07,240
and Gao families

106
00:04:07,380 --> 00:04:08,610
have come to offer condolences.

107
00:04:08,940 --> 00:04:09,760
What?

108
00:04:10,340 --> 00:04:12,240
But I gave strict orders
not to breathe a word.

109
00:04:18,060 --> 00:04:19,140
Madam, I'm sorry for your loss.

110
00:04:19,140 --> 00:04:19,920
Thank you.

111
00:04:19,980 --> 00:04:20,800
My condolences.

112
00:04:21,100 --> 00:04:21,880
Take care of yourself.

113
00:04:22,340 --> 00:04:23,000
I'm sorry for your loss.

114
00:04:23,940 --> 00:04:24,800
You've come all this way.

115
00:04:25,020 --> 00:04:25,560
We appreciate it.

116
00:04:27,020 --> 00:04:27,440
Thank you.

117
00:04:28,420 --> 00:04:30,290
Now that my father's death
is known throughout the city.

118
00:04:30,980 --> 00:04:33,000
Someone might try to
make you the scapegoat.

119
00:04:33,300 --> 00:04:34,920
Until we uncover the truth,

120
00:04:35,420 --> 00:04:36,920
you will stay right here.

121
00:04:37,380 --> 00:04:37,730
Ziming,

122
00:04:38,220 --> 00:04:38,880
keep an eye on her.

123
00:04:45,340 --> 00:04:46,290
Mr. Shen,

124
00:04:49,900 --> 00:04:52,420
I'm here on behalf of the Su family
to pay my respects.

125
00:04:52,420 --> 00:04:53,620
You can't turn me away now, can you?

126
00:04:54,060 --> 00:04:55,380
Do you even know

127
00:04:55,380 --> 00:04:56,580
the meaning of shame?

128
00:04:59,540 --> 00:05:00,100
I heard

129
00:05:00,100 --> 00:05:01,880
you cast aside that wretch Zhou Furong.

130
00:05:02,420 --> 00:05:04,480
Though one shouldn't
rejoice during mourning,

131
00:05:04,740 --> 00:05:06,000
I couldn't help but smile

132
00:05:06,180 --> 00:05:07,320
at the news.

133
00:05:08,060 --> 00:05:09,260
You don't mind, do you?

134
00:05:09,260 --> 00:05:11,300
How did you fool Su Yunqing

135
00:05:11,300 --> 00:05:13,320
into believing you were ever good?

136
00:05:14,940 --> 00:05:16,850
Am I not?

137
00:05:17,900 --> 00:05:18,920
Zhaohua?

138
00:05:19,500 --> 00:05:21,410
Though I knew you wanted to marry her,

139
00:05:21,540 --> 00:05:23,700
I feared she would suffer.

140
00:05:24,020 --> 00:05:26,240
So I took her place to marry you.

141
00:05:26,500 --> 00:05:28,000
Doesn't that make me a good sister?

142
00:05:28,860 --> 00:05:31,000
Shen Xingyan wanted to marry me?

143
00:05:31,700 --> 00:05:33,020
Did he call off the betrothal

144
00:05:33,020 --> 00:05:34,500
because he realized this trick?

145
00:05:34,900 --> 00:05:37,020
After Zhou Furong schemed
to annul our betrothal,

146
00:05:37,180 --> 00:05:38,440
how could I face my family?

147
00:05:39,060 --> 00:05:40,970
Watching Yunqing storm the Shen mansion,

148
00:05:41,020 --> 00:05:41,850
my heart ached.

149
00:05:42,340 --> 00:05:43,740
So I placed the sachet she gave me

150
00:05:43,740 --> 00:05:44,700
on a corpse,

151
00:05:45,140 --> 00:05:46,140
making her believe that I was dead

152
00:05:46,140 --> 00:05:47,320
so that she would stop grieving.

153
00:05:47,780 --> 00:05:49,240
That was my kindness to her.

154
00:05:49,500 --> 00:05:51,290
Blame her naivety.

155
00:05:51,980 --> 00:05:53,300
This is just her fate.

156
00:05:53,300 --> 00:05:54,100
You can't blame me for that.

157
00:05:54,100 --> 00:05:55,820
Don't you feel
the slightest bit of regret?

158
00:05:58,460 --> 00:05:59,480
Regret?

159
00:05:59,540 --> 00:06:00,940
Why should I?

160
00:06:01,100 --> 00:06:02,820
She's in a coma now.

161
00:06:02,940 --> 00:06:05,320
I'm the only daughter left
in the Su family.

162
00:06:06,060 --> 00:06:07,880
No one will compete with me anymore.

163
00:06:08,380 --> 00:06:10,610
Otherwise, I wouldn't be
standing before you today.

164
00:06:16,460 --> 00:06:18,700
Yunqing thinks you're dead!

165
00:06:19,340 --> 00:06:21,220
She's been trying to avenge you.

166
00:06:21,220 --> 00:06:22,820
She's suffered so much!

167
00:06:24,060 --> 00:06:25,580
Why did you do this to her?

168
00:06:25,580 --> 00:06:26,920
Are you even human?

169
00:06:28,060 --> 00:06:28,940
Who do you think you are

170
00:06:28,940 --> 00:06:30,020
to lay a hand on me?

171
00:06:30,140 --> 00:06:31,620
What is Su Yunqing to you?

172
00:06:32,180 --> 00:06:32,660
She's part of the Shen family.

173
00:06:32,660 --> 00:06:33,290
Let go!

174
00:06:33,780 --> 00:06:35,060
It's not your place to lecture her.

175
00:06:35,060 --> 00:06:35,650
Xingyan,

176
00:06:35,700 --> 00:06:36,740
is this how you

177
00:06:36,740 --> 00:06:37,140
treat your guests?

178
00:06:37,140 --> 00:06:37,970
Let me go!

179
00:06:38,540 --> 00:06:39,440
Out!

180
00:06:49,700 --> 00:06:50,800
Is it her?

181
00:06:55,540 --> 00:06:57,620
What was the point of all the suffering

182
00:06:57,860 --> 00:06:59,360
I endured here?

183
00:07:00,580 --> 00:07:02,880
I risked everything for the truth,

184
00:07:03,460 --> 00:07:04,730
only to learn

185
00:07:05,100 --> 00:07:07,560
my own sister was the one
who wanted to harm me.

186
00:07:08,860 --> 00:07:11,260
Now, wearing another's face,

187
00:07:11,820 --> 00:07:13,320
there's no turning back.

188
00:07:14,420 --> 00:07:16,060
What should I do?

189
00:07:17,700 --> 00:07:18,410
No.

190
00:07:19,020 --> 00:07:20,730
If I'm sent to the authorities tomorrow,

191
00:07:20,980 --> 00:07:22,440
it'll be even harder for me to get out.

192
00:07:23,140 --> 00:07:24,880
I need to think of something.

193
00:07:27,620 --> 00:07:28,560
Second Madam?

194
00:07:28,740 --> 00:07:29,730
Second Madam!

195
00:07:29,820 --> 00:07:30,020
Second Madam,

196
00:07:30,020 --> 00:07:31,260
I have something to say!

197
00:07:31,460 --> 00:07:32,140
Second Madam!

198
00:07:32,420 --> 00:07:33,100
Don't you want to know

199
00:07:33,100 --> 00:07:34,850
the truth about the Master's death?

200
00:07:55,740 --> 00:07:56,480
Do you

201
00:07:56,940 --> 00:07:58,770
have a way?

202
00:07:59,260 --> 00:08:00,090
Madam,

203
00:08:00,420 --> 00:08:02,060
the characteristics of drowning a living
and a dead person

204
00:08:02,060 --> 00:08:03,090
are quite different.

205
00:08:03,300 --> 00:08:05,220
When a living person drowns,
water fills their abdomen,

206
00:08:05,220 --> 00:08:06,320
causing the belly to swell.

207
00:08:06,780 --> 00:08:08,440
But a corpse thrown into water does not.

208
00:08:09,620 --> 00:08:10,480
Are you saying

209
00:08:10,780 --> 00:08:12,580
the Master was already dead
in the carriage?

210
00:08:12,580 --> 00:08:13,320
Exactly.

211
00:08:13,460 --> 00:08:15,240
Most likely murdered by the First Madam.

212
00:08:15,860 --> 00:08:16,860
Spout such nonsense,

213
00:08:16,860 --> 00:08:18,560
and I'll have your tongue cut out!

214
00:08:19,580 --> 00:08:20,880
Why didn't you speak up yesterday?

215
00:08:22,440 --> 00:08:23,210
Madam,

216
00:08:23,440 --> 00:08:25,050
no one else in the Shen family

217
00:08:25,610 --> 00:08:27,410
cares about justice for the Master.

218
00:08:28,090 --> 00:08:29,050
Besides,

219
00:08:29,360 --> 00:08:30,770
I'm of low status.

220
00:08:30,970 --> 00:08:32,370
Who would believe me?

221
00:08:35,370 --> 00:08:37,770
You're quite a clever little thing.

222
00:08:39,890 --> 00:08:41,130
But frankly,

223
00:08:42,170 --> 00:08:43,560
you're hoping I'll save you, aren't you

224
00:08:44,320 --> 00:08:45,920
Mutual benefits, that's all.

225
00:08:45,920 --> 00:08:46,840
Alright.

226
00:08:46,920 --> 00:08:47,890
Wait for my word.
