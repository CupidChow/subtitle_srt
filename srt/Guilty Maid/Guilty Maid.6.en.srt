00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:10,080
[Guilty Maid]
[Episode 6]

2
00:00:15,960 --> 00:00:16,720
Shumeng?

3
00:00:17,820 --> 00:00:18,460
Shumeng.

4
00:00:19,060 --> 00:00:20,020
Shumeng, come here.

5
00:00:20,720 --> 00:00:21,650
You know me?

6
00:00:22,020 --> 00:00:22,820
You were taken in

7
00:00:22,980 --> 00:00:24,620
by the Second Madam after hiding

8
00:00:24,860 --> 00:00:26,060
forbidden drug in the workshop.

9
00:00:26,060 --> 00:00:27,020
You exposed Ms. Rong

10
00:00:27,020 --> 00:00:29,300
for embezzling the maids' wages,

11
00:00:29,300 --> 00:00:30,380
got her dismissed,

12
00:00:30,380 --> 00:00:31,940
and that's how you ended up
in the mansion, isn't it?

13
00:00:31,940 --> 00:00:32,660
So what?

14
00:00:32,840 --> 00:00:34,250
Planning to report me to Ms. Rong?

15
00:00:34,250 --> 00:00:35,650
I just need a favor.

16
00:00:36,840 --> 00:00:37,660
What favor?

17
00:00:38,080 --> 00:00:39,940
Find the key to the woodshed

18
00:00:40,300 --> 00:00:41,860
and unlock the door for me.

19
00:00:42,300 --> 00:00:43,580
Why should I help you?

20
00:00:47,660 --> 00:00:48,260
Here.

21
00:00:48,420 --> 00:00:49,260
Take it.

22
00:01:02,200 --> 00:01:03,620
This is the key to the woodshed.

23
00:01:05,280 --> 00:01:06,940
Give me your gold jewelry,

24
00:01:07,060 --> 00:01:08,120
and the key

25
00:01:08,120 --> 00:01:09,200
is yours.

26
00:01:16,280 --> 00:01:17,860
If Mr. Shen fails the examination,

27
00:01:17,860 --> 00:01:19,120
you'd better flee.

28
00:01:25,360 --> 00:01:27,120
He never sat
for the imperial examination.

29
00:01:27,500 --> 00:01:29,640
The Second Madam will never let me go.

30
00:01:30,480 --> 00:01:32,200
If I leave now,

31
00:01:32,420 --> 00:01:33,940
what about my sister?

32
00:01:37,500 --> 00:01:38,300
Su Yunqing,

33
00:01:39,360 --> 00:01:40,920
where are you?

34
00:01:56,780 --> 00:01:57,840
Shen Xingyan?

35
00:01:58,330 --> 00:01:59,060
What happened?

36
00:01:59,060 --> 00:02:00,020
You're injured?

37
00:02:01,920 --> 00:02:02,780
Don't scream.

38
00:02:03,480 --> 00:02:04,280
Help me up.

39
00:02:13,020 --> 00:02:15,140
First, go to the Third Madam
and find Liuli.

40
00:02:15,800 --> 00:02:17,140
Tell her I'm claiming

41
00:02:17,680 --> 00:02:18,800
that maid.

42
00:02:19,480 --> 00:02:20,260
Liuli?

43
00:02:21,680 --> 00:02:22,480
You can barely save yourself,

44
00:02:22,480 --> 00:02:23,680
yet you worry about others?

45
00:02:23,900 --> 00:02:24,960
Let me get you medicine.

46
00:02:33,800 --> 00:02:35,920
The antidote powder is
an ancient prescription

47
00:02:35,920 --> 00:02:36,900
from a renowned healer.

48
00:02:37,240 --> 00:02:38,800
It should work.

49
00:02:40,980 --> 00:02:41,860
Cold.

50
00:02:42,360 --> 00:02:43,800
So cold.

51
00:02:45,980 --> 00:02:47,180
Why is he burning up like this?

52
00:02:54,020 --> 00:02:55,020
So cold.

53
00:02:55,620 --> 00:02:56,860
It's so cold here.

54
00:02:56,860 --> 00:02:58,700
If this continues, he'll be in danger.

55
00:02:58,900 --> 00:03:01,140
Now that I've entered
the Shen family's main house,

56
00:03:01,520 --> 00:03:03,200
you can't die

57
00:03:03,300 --> 00:03:04,380
until I find my sister.

58
00:03:14,260 --> 00:03:14,860
Cold.

59
00:03:15,980 --> 00:03:17,300
So cold.

60
00:03:17,380 --> 00:03:18,900
Why were you looking for Liuli?

61
00:03:19,660 --> 00:03:20,360
Is it because you knew

62
00:03:20,360 --> 00:03:21,860
I once became Liuli?

63
00:03:23,240 --> 00:03:24,890
But the current Liuli

64
00:03:25,260 --> 00:03:27,080
is no longer Su Yunqing.

65
00:03:28,360 --> 00:03:29,760
The real Su Yunqing

66
00:03:30,640 --> 00:03:32,760
is right here before you.

67
00:04:17,820 --> 00:04:19,060
Had your fill of staring
and now you want to leave?

68
00:04:20,060 --> 00:04:21,780
You're fine now. I should go.

69
00:04:22,940 --> 00:04:23,920
Seems you're well indeed.

70
00:04:23,920 --> 00:04:24,770
You've got so much strength.

71
00:04:26,380 --> 00:04:27,500
Throw yourself into my arms,

72
00:04:27,620 --> 00:04:28,800
then leave as you please.

73
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:30,180
So presumptuously?

74
00:04:31,500 --> 00:04:32,180
Who...

75
00:04:32,260 --> 00:04:33,500
Who's being presumptuous?

76
00:04:34,080 --> 00:04:35,000
If not for me,

77
00:04:35,120 --> 00:04:36,700
you'd have died from the poison.

78
00:04:39,160 --> 00:04:40,610
I've saved you countless times.

79
00:04:41,130 --> 00:04:42,570
You save me once

80
00:04:43,610 --> 00:04:44,770
and expect praise?

81
00:04:45,570 --> 00:04:45,890
What...

82
00:04:45,890 --> 00:04:46,970
What nonsense are you spouting?

83
00:04:53,650 --> 00:04:55,570
I'll always remember this sigil.

84
00:04:56,450 --> 00:04:57,450
Su Yunqing,

85
00:05:00,770 --> 00:05:02,330
how could I not recognize you?

86
00:05:07,530 --> 00:05:09,050
If you keep this up, I'll scream.

87
00:05:09,890 --> 00:05:11,250
No one can know I've returned.

88
00:05:13,570 --> 00:05:14,610
Why?

89
00:05:16,930 --> 00:05:17,650
You

90
00:05:18,530 --> 00:05:19,490
don't need to know about this.

91
00:05:19,770 --> 00:05:20,970
You don't care,

92
00:05:21,970 --> 00:05:23,050
but I'm doomed.

93
00:05:24,250 --> 00:05:25,610
If you don't become

94
00:05:25,850 --> 00:05:26,530
the top scholar,

95
00:05:26,810 --> 00:05:27,650
the Second Madam
will be even more convinced

96
00:05:27,650 --> 00:05:29,330
it's the consequence
of the talisman's backlash.

97
00:05:30,610 --> 00:05:31,570
I'm as good as dead.

98
00:06:03,210 --> 00:06:04,650
This is the final dose.

99
00:06:04,850 --> 00:06:06,850
Finish it, and you'll be fully healed.

100
00:06:06,970 --> 00:06:07,610
In return

101
00:06:07,890 --> 00:06:09,530
for saving you, I hope you'll

102
00:06:09,610 --> 00:06:11,410
plead my case with the Second Madam.

103
00:06:13,650 --> 00:06:14,490
Don't worry.

104
00:06:14,890 --> 00:06:16,130
You'll be fine.

105
00:06:35,770 --> 00:06:36,930
What did you feed me?

106
00:06:37,610 --> 00:06:38,330
Is it...?

107
00:06:38,490 --> 00:06:39,530
Don't be absurd.

108
00:06:40,210 --> 00:06:41,130
To purge

109
00:06:41,130 --> 00:06:42,770
the last traces of poison,

110
00:06:42,890 --> 00:06:44,610
a rejection reaction is inevitable.

111
00:06:45,210 --> 00:06:46,530
The fever is normal.

112
00:06:46,530 --> 00:06:47,450
Just bear with it for a while.

113
00:06:48,530 --> 00:06:49,250
Sweating it out

114
00:06:49,250 --> 00:06:50,050
will speed your recovery.

115
00:06:50,770 --> 00:06:51,970
You can't take off any more clothes.

116
00:06:53,290 --> 00:06:54,610
Stop taking off your clothes.

117
00:07:04,010 --> 00:07:04,570
Xingyan,

118
00:07:04,890 --> 00:07:06,050
what are you doing here?

119
00:07:06,650 --> 00:07:07,650
You wretch!

120
00:07:07,650 --> 00:07:09,170
How dare you seduce my son?

121
00:07:09,290 --> 00:07:10,770
I'll teach you...

122
00:07:11,450 --> 00:07:12,210
Second Madam,

123
00:07:12,210 --> 00:07:13,090
are you alright?

124
00:07:13,130 --> 00:07:13,970
Second Madam.
