00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:10,080
[Guilty Maid]
[Episode 9]

2
00:00:26,940 --> 00:00:28,260
Rest assured, Yunqing.

3
00:00:28,660 --> 00:00:30,340
I would never take advantage of you.

4
00:00:31,700 --> 00:00:33,260
This outcome

5
00:00:33,820 --> 00:00:35,220
was never my intention.

6
00:00:37,140 --> 00:00:38,140
I promise you.

7
00:00:38,780 --> 00:00:40,380
Whether it's your sister's case

8
00:00:40,980 --> 00:00:42,380
or the curse upon you,

9
00:00:43,220 --> 00:00:44,900
I will exhaust every means

10
00:00:45,660 --> 00:00:46,700
to help you.

11
00:00:59,460 --> 00:01:00,460
Don't be afraid.

12
00:01:01,940 --> 00:01:02,980
I won't look.

13
00:01:18,660 --> 00:01:19,580
Darn it.

14
00:01:19,940 --> 00:01:21,980
Why is the allergic reaction so severe?

15
00:01:22,020 --> 00:01:23,860
I can't even move.

16
00:01:25,020 --> 00:01:26,060
This is unbearable.

17
00:01:26,260 --> 00:01:27,220
Somebody help me.

18
00:01:27,860 --> 00:01:29,500
I can barely breathe.

19
00:01:30,460 --> 00:01:31,340
What's wrong with you?

20
00:01:36,140 --> 00:01:37,020
How is it you?

21
00:01:51,260 --> 00:01:52,820
Taking a concubine is one thing,

22
00:01:53,100 --> 00:01:55,140
but why pull this switcheroo?

23
00:01:56,460 --> 00:01:58,220
Seems this wedding would be ruined.

24
00:01:59,060 --> 00:02:00,340
The furniture is quite exquisite.

25
00:02:01,220 --> 00:02:02,460
If it's no longer needed,

26
00:02:02,620 --> 00:02:03,900
how about moving it to my room?

27
00:02:05,500 --> 00:02:06,420
Sir, how is she?

28
00:02:06,620 --> 00:02:07,660
Second Madam,

29
00:02:07,660 --> 00:02:09,020
she's unconscious.

30
00:02:09,100 --> 00:02:11,060
Seems the entire room's furniture

31
00:02:11,060 --> 00:02:12,260
has been coated with a potent toxin.

32
00:02:12,740 --> 00:02:13,940
Prolonged exposure

33
00:02:13,940 --> 00:02:15,620
causes full-body itching and festering.

34
00:02:15,620 --> 00:02:16,100
Run!

35
00:02:16,260 --> 00:02:17,020
Second Madam, leave now!

36
00:02:22,300 --> 00:02:23,060
Zhou Furong,

37
00:02:23,540 --> 00:02:25,060
you're so vicious.

38
00:02:25,260 --> 00:02:26,340
Where is Cuiqiao?

39
00:02:26,620 --> 00:02:27,300
Mr. Shen.

40
00:02:27,300 --> 00:02:27,900
Get lost!

41
00:02:28,860 --> 00:02:29,700
Trouble!

42
00:02:29,700 --> 00:02:31,660
Cuiqiao has fainted in the woodshed!

43
00:02:32,380 --> 00:02:32,900
Trouble!

44
00:02:32,900 --> 00:02:33,500
Xingyan.

45
00:02:33,500 --> 00:02:34,180
Cuiqiao has fainted in the woodshed!

46
00:02:34,180 --> 00:02:34,820
Where are you going?

47
00:02:45,980 --> 00:02:46,980
It's alright now, Su Yunqing.

48
00:02:48,380 --> 00:02:49,580
Are you hurt?

49
00:02:52,380 --> 00:02:53,220
Su Yunqing?

50
00:03:00,580 --> 00:03:01,780
Why has the sigil vanished?

51
00:03:02,580 --> 00:03:03,340
Su Yunqing,

52
00:03:04,020 --> 00:03:05,220
where are you?

53
00:03:06,280 --> 00:03:08,420
[Shen Mansion]

54
00:03:08,420 --> 00:03:11,860
Seems I've been too lenient with you.

55
00:03:12,980 --> 00:03:14,180
Look at what you've done

56
00:03:14,180 --> 00:03:16,020
to the Shen family's reputation!

57
00:03:16,860 --> 00:03:18,420
The imperial results
hasn't even been publicized.

58
00:03:18,780 --> 00:03:20,820
Why take a concubine now?

59
00:03:21,220 --> 00:03:23,100
And now you've reduced Furong to this.

60
00:03:23,300 --> 00:03:25,220
How am I supposed to explain this
to Master Zhou?

61
00:03:25,260 --> 00:03:26,700
Zhou Furong is vile.

62
00:03:26,900 --> 00:03:28,060
She tried to poison Cuiqiao.

63
00:03:28,660 --> 00:03:30,820
She brought this upon herself.

64
00:03:30,820 --> 00:03:31,460
Outrageous!

65
00:03:32,180 --> 00:03:34,780
Master's business in the capital thrives

66
00:03:35,020 --> 00:03:38,020
solely because of Master Zhou's support.

67
00:03:38,900 --> 00:03:41,260
This concerns the Zhou family's dignity.

68
00:03:41,460 --> 00:03:42,980
It must not be made public.

69
00:03:43,500 --> 00:03:45,140
I've already discussed with Master Zhou.

70
00:03:45,700 --> 00:03:47,220
You two should marry soon

71
00:03:47,580 --> 00:03:49,220
to avoid further scandal.

72
00:03:49,300 --> 00:03:50,140
Aunt,

73
00:03:50,300 --> 00:03:51,940
I will never marry Zhou Furong.

74
00:03:52,060 --> 00:03:54,020
Parents decide who their children
will marry.

75
00:03:55,940 --> 00:03:57,380
This is not your decision to make.

76
00:04:06,220 --> 00:04:07,020
Mr. Shen,

77
00:04:07,380 --> 00:04:09,380
I've observed everyone in the mansion.

78
00:04:09,580 --> 00:04:11,580
No one's behavior seems unusual.

79
00:04:12,340 --> 00:04:15,020
I think Su Yunqing is no longer here.

80
00:04:17,300 --> 00:04:19,980
Mr. Shen, are you truly
going against Zhou Furong?

81
00:04:19,980 --> 00:04:22,060
She's repeatedly tried to
poison Yunqing.

82
00:04:22,940 --> 00:04:24,100
She's gone too far.

83
00:04:43,060 --> 00:04:43,980
Oh no.

84
00:04:43,980 --> 00:04:46,260
He must have mistaken me
for Zhou Furong.

85
00:04:57,860 --> 00:04:58,620
Look.

86
00:04:59,100 --> 00:05:00,860
This place should be familiar to you.

87
00:05:01,540 --> 00:05:03,980
You kidnapped Su Zhaohua,

88
00:05:05,500 --> 00:05:07,260
forcing me to break off the engagement,

89
00:05:09,140 --> 00:05:10,620
not knowing

90
00:05:12,100 --> 00:05:13,540
I'd already wanted to.

91
00:05:15,140 --> 00:05:16,260
If anything,

92
00:05:17,860 --> 00:05:19,940
I despise her more than you do.

93
00:05:20,060 --> 00:05:21,460
Or did you really believe

94
00:05:22,180 --> 00:05:24,820
you could take her away so easily?

95
00:05:25,980 --> 00:05:28,380
So my sister's death
really is tied to you.

96
00:05:28,820 --> 00:05:30,340
You knew she was in danger

97
00:05:30,380 --> 00:05:31,500
and did nothing.

98
00:05:32,380 --> 00:05:33,180
Shen Xingyan,

99
00:05:34,260 --> 00:05:36,060
why did you lie to me?

100
00:05:37,100 --> 00:05:40,220
You love dragging people here.

101
00:05:40,820 --> 00:05:42,340
Why not experience it yourself?

102
00:05:43,780 --> 00:05:44,820
Tonight,

103
00:05:45,820 --> 00:05:47,060
you'll reflect

104
00:05:48,860 --> 00:05:50,940
on your sins here.

105
00:06:08,750 --> 00:06:11,080
[Shen Mansion]

106
00:06:20,580 --> 00:06:20,980
Fu...

107
00:06:21,380 --> 00:06:21,780
Fu...

108
00:06:22,140 --> 00:06:22,980
Furong?

109
00:06:24,300 --> 00:06:24,740
What...

110
00:06:25,020 --> 00:06:25,500
What are you

111
00:06:25,580 --> 00:06:26,180
doing here?

112
00:06:27,740 --> 00:06:28,740
Don't scare me like this.

113
00:06:29,980 --> 00:06:31,900
You want a grandchild, don't you?

114
00:06:34,180 --> 00:06:36,180
Let me marry Mr. Shen.

115
00:06:37,100 --> 00:06:38,820
I'll marry him tomorrow.

116
00:06:40,940 --> 00:06:42,900
I don't need formalities.

117
00:06:44,500 --> 00:06:46,820
I don't need blessings from others.

118
00:06:47,740 --> 00:06:49,380
Just let me marry him.

119
00:06:50,620 --> 00:06:51,420
Or

120
00:06:52,780 --> 00:06:55,580
you may never have a grandchild.

121
00:06:55,940 --> 00:06:56,740
Rest assured.

122
00:06:57,260 --> 00:07:00,180
I'll let you marry him
as soon as possible.

123
00:07:00,620 --> 00:07:01,580
But you have to...

124
00:07:01,580 --> 00:07:02,100
No.

125
00:07:02,100 --> 00:07:03,060
recover your health.

126
00:07:03,060 --> 00:07:03,740
No.

127
00:07:04,460 --> 00:07:05,380
Tomorrow.

128
00:07:06,220 --> 00:07:07,940
I want the wedding tomorrow.

129
00:07:08,660 --> 00:07:10,500
I won't wait a moment longer.

130
00:07:10,500 --> 00:07:11,300
Alright.

131
00:07:11,300 --> 00:07:13,340
I'll send a word to your father tonight.

132
00:07:13,900 --> 00:07:14,620
Tomorrow.

133
00:07:16,300 --> 00:07:17,900
Shen Xingyan,

134
00:07:18,300 --> 00:07:19,740
I will marry you.

135
00:07:20,300 --> 00:07:22,260
I will find the proof.

136
00:07:22,580 --> 00:07:24,620
And you will pay

137
00:07:24,940 --> 00:07:26,500
for my sister's death.
