[Guilty Maid]
[Episode 18]

2
00:00:19,760 --> 00:00:21,210
Aren't you scared?

3
00:00:21,300 --> 00:00:22,600
I am.

4
00:00:23,120 --> 00:00:24,440
But the living terrify me

5
00:00:24,620 --> 00:00:25,720
more than the dead.

6
00:00:26,370 --> 00:00:28,050
There are things I have to uncover.

7
00:00:28,120 --> 00:00:29,600
I can't just become a scapegoat.

8
00:00:30,620 --> 00:00:32,260
Wait for me.

9
00:00:34,860 --> 00:00:35,660
Master,

10
00:00:36,300 --> 00:00:37,860
I have to protect Xingyan.

11
00:00:40,120 --> 00:00:40,930
Qiuyue.

12
00:00:41,980 --> 00:00:43,020
Call for me

13
00:00:43,140 --> 00:00:43,980
when you're done.

14
00:00:44,400 --> 00:00:45,370
Madam,

15
00:00:45,760 --> 00:00:46,580
you're upright and honorable.

16
00:00:46,580 --> 00:00:47,900
So there's no need to be afraid.

17
00:00:48,120 --> 00:00:48,800
Come here.

18
00:00:49,720 --> 00:00:51,050
You know how to conduct an autopsy?

19
00:00:51,440 --> 00:00:52,250
Common knowledge.

20
00:00:54,220 --> 00:00:55,440
No abdominal swelling.

21
00:00:57,120 --> 00:00:58,120
No wrinkled soles.

22
00:01:00,720 --> 00:01:02,290
No silt under the nails.

23
00:01:02,720 --> 00:01:04,450
No foam or mud in the nose or mouth.

24
00:01:05,280 --> 00:01:07,760
Hands clenched in a defensive posture.

25
00:01:08,920 --> 00:01:09,730
Madam,

26
00:01:10,140 --> 00:01:11,780
the Master didn't die from drowning.

27
00:01:12,400 --> 00:01:13,530
He was thrown into water after death.

28
00:01:13,760 --> 00:01:14,660
Clenched fists.

29
00:01:14,660 --> 00:01:15,500
Defensive posture.

30
00:01:20,700 --> 00:01:22,200
He was defending himself.

31
00:01:22,840 --> 00:01:24,170
That proves he was murdered.

32
00:01:27,660 --> 00:01:29,220
But I only know how to
check for drowning.

33
00:01:29,360 --> 00:01:31,530
Still, we've confirmed
it was a staged drowning.

34
00:01:31,780 --> 00:01:32,580
So, Second Madam,

35
00:01:32,840 --> 00:01:34,920
you can rest assured
and invite a coroner now.

36
00:01:35,660 --> 00:01:38,060
The First Madam left the mansion late
at night with the Master's body.

37
00:01:38,400 --> 00:01:39,400
She's implicated

38
00:01:39,940 --> 00:01:41,140
in his death.

39
00:01:50,760 --> 00:01:51,610
Now,

40
00:01:52,060 --> 00:01:54,400
there's no point in staying here.

41
00:01:54,840 --> 00:01:56,700
But with this face,

42
00:01:56,700 --> 00:01:58,060
even if I return to the Su family

43
00:01:58,360 --> 00:02:00,330
and confront Shaohua,

44
00:02:01,140 --> 00:02:02,700
will my parents believe me?

45
00:02:04,220 --> 00:02:06,400
This curse upon me

46
00:02:06,420 --> 00:02:07,920
was likely brought about by Shaohua.

47
00:02:09,020 --> 00:02:10,260
The world is vast.

48
00:02:10,800 --> 00:02:13,330
Yet where do I belong?

49
00:02:15,900 --> 00:02:17,380
What are you doing now?

50
00:02:19,140 --> 00:02:20,760
Zhou Furong is in a coma.

51
00:02:20,760 --> 00:02:21,920
Did you know?

52
00:02:22,960 --> 00:02:24,410
How would I know?

53
00:02:25,020 --> 00:02:26,580
Qiuyue is all thumbs.

54
00:02:26,580 --> 00:02:28,520
She can't administer an abortifacient.

55
00:02:28,620 --> 00:02:30,200
How could she conduct an autopsy

56
00:02:30,680 --> 00:02:32,360
or use my mother

57
00:02:32,360 --> 00:02:34,130
to absolve herself?

58
00:02:34,300 --> 00:02:34,760
I...

59
00:02:35,960 --> 00:02:37,410
I was pretending all along.

60
00:02:37,760 --> 00:02:39,080
Now it's a matter of life and death.

61
00:02:40,020 --> 00:02:41,300
I just don't want to hide anymore.

62
00:02:42,200 --> 00:02:43,200
I'll give you a chance.

63
00:02:43,900 --> 00:02:45,140
Tell me you're not Qiuyue,

64
00:02:45,140 --> 00:02:46,260
and I'll spare you.

65
00:02:47,820 --> 00:02:48,800
Shen Xingyan,

66
00:02:49,620 --> 00:02:51,300
I won't trust you again.

67
00:02:52,200 --> 00:02:53,960
Mr. Shen, what do you mean?

68
00:02:53,960 --> 00:02:55,130
I am Qiuyue.

69
00:02:57,520 --> 00:02:58,640
No sigil?

70
00:03:04,700 --> 00:03:06,520
Mr. Shen, if you want me,

71
00:03:07,480 --> 00:03:08,850
I'd be more than delighted.

72
00:03:10,800 --> 00:03:12,330
Why resort to force?

73
00:03:32,860 --> 00:03:34,100
You're indeed not her.

74
00:03:40,760 --> 00:03:41,730
Mr. Shen,

75
00:03:42,520 --> 00:03:44,410
I'm already carrying your child.

76
00:03:46,100 --> 00:03:47,820
Why play hard to get?

77
00:03:49,360 --> 00:03:51,610
Stop spouting nonsense.

78
00:04:16,440 --> 00:04:17,050
Xingyan,

79
00:04:17,360 --> 00:04:19,530
[Account Book]
these are our family's accounts.

80
00:04:19,530 --> 00:04:21,000
I've reviewed them. There's no problem.

81
00:04:21,240 --> 00:04:22,820
Take a look at this.

82
00:04:22,820 --> 00:04:24,820
Someone left it at my doorstep.

83
00:04:24,820 --> 00:04:26,680
It scared me to death when I opened it.

84
00:04:27,380 --> 00:04:29,500
It records all the secret accounts
of the Shen family

85
00:04:29,500 --> 00:04:30,820
over the years.

86
00:04:31,500 --> 00:04:32,360
Secret accounts?

87
00:04:32,680 --> 00:04:34,050
Take a look.

88
00:04:34,480 --> 00:04:35,740
The jewelry we sold

89
00:04:35,740 --> 00:04:37,680
to those officials and nobles

90
00:04:37,680 --> 00:04:38,680
in the capital

91
00:04:39,060 --> 00:04:41,580
turns out to be
gold-plated silver fakes!

92
00:04:42,060 --> 00:04:44,220
If this ever reaches the capital,

93
00:04:44,260 --> 00:04:46,380
the entire Shen clan
couldn't appease their fury.

94
00:04:48,540 --> 00:04:49,940
Check this out.

95
00:04:50,100 --> 00:04:51,340
This was ordered by the Princess.

96
00:04:51,820 --> 00:04:54,500
She's wearing it at the Marquis's
birthday banquet next month.

97
00:04:54,500 --> 00:04:55,820
It's all fake.

98
00:04:55,940 --> 00:04:56,860
Strange.

99
00:04:57,180 --> 00:05:00,220
Why are there so many transactions
with the Su family?

100
00:05:00,380 --> 00:05:00,980
Xingyan,

101
00:05:01,420 --> 00:05:03,100
the Princess and the Marquis

102
00:05:03,580 --> 00:05:05,580
are ruthless killers.

103
00:05:06,100 --> 00:05:07,420
What will we do

104
00:05:07,420 --> 00:05:08,500
if they ever find out?

105
00:05:09,140 --> 00:05:10,020
Oh no, we're doomed.

106
00:05:10,020 --> 00:05:11,100
The Shen family this time...

107
00:05:11,100 --> 00:05:12,860
We're truly finished.

108
00:05:12,860 --> 00:05:15,260
What do we do?

109
00:05:16,820 --> 00:05:17,380
What should we do?

110
00:05:17,380 --> 00:05:18,100
Mother,

111
00:05:18,340 --> 00:05:20,820
you're the mistress of the house now.

112
00:05:20,820 --> 00:05:22,140
No more panic like this, OK?

113
00:05:22,140 --> 00:05:22,820
I...

114
00:05:23,340 --> 00:05:24,260
I'll investigate

115
00:05:24,260 --> 00:05:25,580
these secret accounts.

116
00:05:32,620 --> 00:05:35,020
The Su family has always dealt
in medicinal herbs.

117
00:05:35,420 --> 00:05:37,300
I've never heard
of any business dealings

118
00:05:37,300 --> 00:05:39,100
with the Shen family.

119
00:05:43,620 --> 00:05:44,580
Is it

120
00:05:46,540 --> 00:05:47,820
connected to my sister?

121
00:05:50,780 --> 00:05:51,420
Mr. Shen,

122
00:05:51,820 --> 00:05:53,460
we still haven't found Miss Su.

123
00:05:54,100 --> 00:05:54,980
Keep searching.

124
00:05:55,620 --> 00:05:56,340
Mr. Shen,

125
00:05:56,460 --> 00:05:57,820
with the Shen family in such turmoil...

126
00:05:58,020 --> 00:05:58,940
I told you to search.

127
00:05:59,660 --> 00:06:01,180
Need I repeat myself?

128
00:06:03,380 --> 00:06:04,140
No, sir.

129
00:06:07,580 --> 00:06:08,460
[Account Book]

130
00:06:09,740 --> 00:06:10,540
Su Yunqing,

131
00:06:11,380 --> 00:06:13,460
why do you always make me
search for you?

132
00:06:20,220 --> 00:06:21,500
Greetings, Fourth Madam.

133
00:06:21,900 --> 00:06:22,860
Qiuyue, come and sit.

134
00:06:23,140 --> 00:06:24,060
No need for formalities.

135
00:06:26,820 --> 00:06:28,620
Though we've never interacted before,

136
00:06:28,900 --> 00:06:29,780
I've seen what you did

137
00:06:29,780 --> 00:06:31,180
regarding the Master's death.

138
00:06:31,580 --> 00:06:33,500
I just like

139
00:06:33,500 --> 00:06:35,060
clever girls like you.

140
00:06:36,780 --> 00:06:37,260
Here.

141
00:06:37,260 --> 00:06:37,940
Thank you, Madam.

142
00:06:39,060 --> 00:06:39,580
But

143
00:06:40,140 --> 00:06:41,820
I don't think you called me here

144
00:06:42,020 --> 00:06:43,260
just to say that.

145
00:06:45,820 --> 00:06:46,460
Qiuyue,

146
00:06:46,780 --> 00:06:48,500
what are your plans for the future?

147
00:06:49,060 --> 00:06:49,940
Plans?

148
00:06:51,300 --> 00:06:53,100
What plans could I possibly have

149
00:06:53,380 --> 00:06:54,820
with this face now?

150
00:06:54,820 --> 00:06:57,220
With your insight, you didn't come here

151
00:06:57,300 --> 00:06:59,060
just to be a concubine, did you?

152
00:07:01,940 --> 00:07:03,860
Rather than living under others' roof,

153
00:07:03,860 --> 00:07:05,220
at their mercy,

154
00:07:05,820 --> 00:07:06,580
why not

155
00:07:07,100 --> 00:07:09,660
stand tall as your true self?
