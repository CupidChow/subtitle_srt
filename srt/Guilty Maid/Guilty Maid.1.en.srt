00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:10,080
[Guilty Maid]
[Episode 1]

2
00:00:10,590 --> 00:00:12,080
I have loads of money.

3
00:00:12,080 --> 00:00:15,000
I doubt whether you possess
anything of genuine worth.

4
00:00:15,510 --> 00:00:17,510
I've devoted my entire life

5
00:00:17,960 --> 00:00:19,550
to refining this elixir.

6
00:00:20,160 --> 00:00:21,120
Upon ingestion,

7
00:00:21,120 --> 00:00:22,390
it concentrates one's vital energy

8
00:00:22,390 --> 00:00:23,760
to form a lycoris radiata sigil

9
00:00:23,760 --> 00:00:25,830
at the Yunmen acupoint.

10
00:00:26,320 --> 00:00:27,350
Will it

11
00:00:27,550 --> 00:00:29,870
truly condemn her
to a lifetime of misery?

12
00:00:30,280 --> 00:00:32,790
Whenever those she despises face peril,

13
00:00:33,350 --> 00:00:35,000
she shall assume their forms

14
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:36,470
to bear their misfortunes

15
00:00:36,750 --> 00:00:37,960
and to live eternally

16
00:00:38,280 --> 00:00:41,070
wearing the faces of her loathed ones.

17
00:00:41,960 --> 00:00:43,600
Are you satisfied?

18
00:01:00,040 --> 00:01:03,040
[Su Yunqing]
[Second Young Miss of the Su family]

19
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:14,150
Come to your senses?

20
00:01:15,280 --> 00:01:17,710
Then leave now.

21
00:01:26,150 --> 00:01:28,040
You think you can find your sister?

22
00:01:29,590 --> 00:01:30,510
Shen Xingyan,

23
00:01:30,760 --> 00:01:32,120
you are callously taking people's lives.

24
00:01:32,120 --> 00:01:33,280
Karma will come after you!

25
00:01:37,590 --> 00:01:38,280
Leave.

26
00:01:39,070 --> 00:01:41,120
Return to the Su household
where you belong to.

27
00:01:41,310 --> 00:01:44,000
This is no place for childish games.

28
00:01:44,280 --> 00:01:45,840
I fought hard to get in here.

29
00:01:46,120 --> 00:01:49,350
I'll uncover who has murdered my sister!

30
00:01:51,120 --> 00:01:51,760
Very well.

31
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:55,040
You have three months.

32
00:01:56,400 --> 00:01:57,150
Three months?

33
00:01:57,150 --> 00:01:59,120
I'll arrange for you to work as a maid

34
00:01:59,280 --> 00:02:00,400
in the Shen family workshop.

35
00:02:00,510 --> 00:02:01,840
If you can

36
00:02:01,840 --> 00:02:03,430
enter the main house

37
00:02:03,560 --> 00:02:04,920
within three months,

38
00:02:05,590 --> 00:02:07,430
I'll tell you the truth.

39
00:02:10,430 --> 00:02:12,800
Open your eyes and look where you are.

40
00:02:12,800 --> 00:02:14,030
You think you can barge
into the Shen mansion

41
00:02:14,190 --> 00:02:15,000
[Matron Rong]
[Head servant of the Third Madam]

42
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:16,320
to search for someone?

43
00:02:16,630 --> 00:02:19,150
Shen family's heir
was betrothed to our Su family.

44
00:02:19,150 --> 00:02:20,840
Yet he abruptly broke the engagement
on the wedding day.

45
00:02:21,360 --> 00:02:22,560
My sister came to demand answers

46
00:02:22,750 --> 00:02:23,870
and vanished without a trace.

47
00:02:23,960 --> 00:02:24,280
I know

48
00:02:24,870 --> 00:02:26,240
the Shens use illegal torture.

49
00:02:26,310 --> 00:02:27,910
They even beat people to death.

50
00:02:28,360 --> 00:02:29,630
But even if my sister made a mistake,

51
00:02:29,840 --> 00:02:31,030
you can't violate the law

52
00:02:31,030 --> 00:02:31,870
and torture her illegally!

53
00:02:31,870 --> 00:02:32,800
Outrageous!

54
00:02:32,870 --> 00:02:34,310
How dare you slander
the Shen family in public?

55
00:02:34,310 --> 00:02:35,150
Stop.

56
00:02:37,310 --> 00:02:38,000
Madam.

57
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:40,150
Brawling in broad daylight.

58
00:02:40,280 --> 00:02:41,400
[Third Madam of the Shen family]
What would outsiders think

59
00:02:41,400 --> 00:02:42,400
of such spectacle?

60
00:02:42,710 --> 00:02:44,190
She keeps clamoring

61
00:02:44,190 --> 00:02:45,800
to see the First Madam.

62
00:02:45,960 --> 00:02:46,240
Claims she's searching...

63
00:02:46,240 --> 00:02:46,630
First Madam?

64
00:02:46,630 --> 00:02:48,240
for her older sister Su Zhaohua.

65
00:02:53,080 --> 00:02:53,750
Rise.

66
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:00,590
Take her to search the mass graves.

67
00:03:02,190 --> 00:03:03,560
You should thank Third Madam.

68
00:03:03,560 --> 00:03:04,960
Look carefully when you get there.

69
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:05,960
Let me go!

70
00:03:18,570 --> 00:03:22,050
[Su]

71
00:03:25,710 --> 00:03:26,280
This is

72
00:03:26,590 --> 00:03:27,750
my sister's sachet.

73
00:03:30,800 --> 00:03:31,710
Zhaohua.

74
00:03:32,710 --> 00:03:33,560
Where are you,

75
00:03:33,560 --> 00:03:34,430
Zhaohua?

76
00:03:35,310 --> 00:03:36,520
Who killed you?

77
00:03:38,280 --> 00:03:40,870
I will get justice for you!

78
00:03:51,870 --> 00:03:52,630
That's her?

79
00:03:53,150 --> 00:03:54,030
Yes, Mr. Shen.

80
00:03:54,470 --> 00:03:55,150
Mr. Shen?

81
00:03:55,870 --> 00:03:56,470
Go.

82
00:03:57,080 --> 00:03:57,560
Yes.

83
00:04:14,280 --> 00:04:15,280
So it is you.

84
00:04:17,800 --> 00:04:18,750
I'll kill you!

85
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:21,190
Is this how you greet

86
00:04:21,190 --> 00:04:22,160
your brother-in-law?

87
00:04:22,920 --> 00:04:23,920
Brother-in-law?

88
00:04:24,600 --> 00:04:25,510
Shen Xingyan?

89
00:04:28,830 --> 00:04:31,000
You're the one who killed my sister!

90
00:04:33,310 --> 00:04:34,480
Let me go!

91
00:04:35,430 --> 00:04:37,000
Give her back to me!

92
00:04:37,190 --> 00:04:38,390
Let me go!

93
00:04:38,390 --> 00:04:39,390
Let go!

94
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:48,950
Wipe your face.

95
00:04:49,950 --> 00:04:50,920
Or the workshop

96
00:04:51,360 --> 00:04:52,480
won't take you.

97
00:04:53,070 --> 00:04:54,920
If you really killed her,

98
00:04:55,720 --> 00:04:57,830
I'll drag you to prison myself.

99
00:05:03,870 --> 00:05:05,560
The Shen mansion is a nest of vipers.

100
00:05:06,360 --> 00:05:08,070
If you want the truth,

101
00:05:08,270 --> 00:05:10,040
you'll have to learn patience.

102
00:05:11,040 --> 00:05:12,870
I'd rather not return

103
00:05:13,270 --> 00:05:15,270
to find you in the mass graves.

104
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:25,800
From now on,

105
00:05:25,950 --> 00:05:27,920
I'm your new matron.

106
00:05:30,870 --> 00:05:33,390
The First Madam needs a new maid.

107
00:05:33,430 --> 00:05:35,950
One of you will be chosen.

108
00:05:36,240 --> 00:05:38,480
They could come
to select someone someday.

109
00:05:38,800 --> 00:05:39,950
Why her?

110
00:05:40,390 --> 00:05:41,750
Starting now,

111
00:05:41,950 --> 00:05:44,160
I'll enforce strict rules.

112
00:05:44,600 --> 00:05:46,310
All of you, stay sharp!

113
00:05:46,510 --> 00:05:47,310
- Yes!
- Yes!

114
00:05:48,430 --> 00:05:49,120
Qiuyue.

115
00:05:49,870 --> 00:05:51,430
Greetings, Ms. Rong.

116
00:05:51,870 --> 00:05:53,430
Qiuyue's needlework is exquisite.

117
00:05:53,720 --> 00:05:55,480
The First Madam praised her highly.

118
00:05:56,310 --> 00:05:58,720
She'll have a bright future.

119
00:05:58,950 --> 00:06:00,950
If you want to serve the First Madam,

120
00:06:01,920 --> 00:06:03,510
learn from her.

121
00:06:04,510 --> 00:06:05,870
Especially you, Shumeng!

122
00:06:06,600 --> 00:06:08,750
One more clumsy mistake, and you're out.

123
00:06:10,070 --> 00:06:12,270
You're really disappointing.

124
00:06:12,630 --> 00:06:13,800
Back to work!

125
00:06:14,160 --> 00:06:16,120
Since when did Qiuyue become so skilled?

126
00:06:16,920 --> 00:06:17,600
Yunqing,

127
00:06:17,920 --> 00:06:19,360
thank you for helping me
with the jewelry last time.

128
00:06:19,390 --> 00:06:20,510
You've always been so kind to me.

129
00:06:21,040 --> 00:06:23,870
You looked out for me
when I first joined the workshop.

130
00:06:31,310 --> 00:06:32,720
It's all my fault for being so clumsy.

131
00:06:33,160 --> 00:06:34,360
If only I had

132
00:06:34,430 --> 00:06:36,510
your skills.

133
00:06:37,240 --> 00:06:38,390
Skill comes with practice.

134
00:06:38,480 --> 00:06:39,480
You can't rush it.

135
00:06:41,720 --> 00:06:42,510
Yunqing,

136
00:06:42,720 --> 00:06:44,040
you're talented.

137
00:06:44,190 --> 00:06:46,040
Why not let the First Madam know?

138
00:06:46,600 --> 00:06:48,720
If you could serve the First Madam,

139
00:06:49,040 --> 00:06:50,160
investigating your sister's death

140
00:06:50,160 --> 00:06:51,480
would be much easier.

141
00:06:52,390 --> 00:06:53,920
The Shen family's affairs
are too complicated.

142
00:06:54,360 --> 00:06:55,600
I can't act rashly.

143
00:06:58,160 --> 00:06:58,510
Here.

144
00:06:59,360 --> 00:07:00,830
This is the hairpiece commissioned
by the Princess.

145
00:07:00,950 --> 00:07:01,390
Tomorrow,

146
00:07:01,560 --> 00:07:03,270
use this filigree as the base...

147
00:07:03,270 --> 00:07:05,240
Then accent it with 18 rubies.

148
00:07:05,600 --> 00:07:06,950
Don't let others know

149
00:07:06,950 --> 00:07:08,310
I assisted you.

150
00:07:08,430 --> 00:07:10,070
Or I'll face terrible consequences.

151
00:07:10,360 --> 00:07:11,000
Don't worry.

152
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:11,800
I've memorized

153
00:07:11,800 --> 00:07:12,630
everything you taught me.

154
00:07:13,870 --> 00:07:14,600
Let's go.

155
00:07:16,360 --> 00:07:17,360
Your shoulder pains you again?

156
00:07:18,040 --> 00:07:18,800
An old ailment.

157
00:07:18,870 --> 00:07:19,630
It's nothing.

158
00:07:20,750 --> 00:07:21,270
Let's go.

159
00:07:24,310 --> 00:07:26,390
So it was Su Yunqing helping her.

160
00:07:35,800 --> 00:07:36,510
Su Yunqing.

161
00:07:37,310 --> 00:07:38,160
What are you doing?

162
00:07:41,190 --> 00:07:42,430
Trying to seduce men?

163
00:07:43,310 --> 00:07:44,310
Do I really need to report

164
00:07:44,310 --> 00:07:45,240
my every move to you?

165
00:07:45,830 --> 00:07:47,070
As a newcomer,

166
00:07:47,600 --> 00:07:49,560
do you even understand hierarchy?

167
00:07:50,070 --> 00:07:51,560
I'm doing you a favor.

168
00:07:53,040 --> 00:07:54,190
Did you hurt your shoulder?

169
00:07:54,430 --> 00:07:54,920
Here.

170
00:07:55,800 --> 00:07:56,240
Su Yunqing,

171
00:07:56,240 --> 00:07:57,240
listen well.

172
00:07:57,360 --> 00:07:58,390
The First Madam's

173
00:07:58,390 --> 00:07:59,630
personal maid position

174
00:07:59,630 --> 00:08:01,040
is mine.

175
00:08:01,430 --> 00:08:02,750
I'm warning you and Qiuyue

176
00:08:03,190 --> 00:08:04,430
to back off.

177
00:08:06,240 --> 00:08:07,800
When did I ever compete with you?

178
00:08:07,920 --> 00:08:08,870
You're still lying?

179
00:08:18,600 --> 00:08:19,360
Sneaking food again?

180
00:08:20,600 --> 00:08:21,360
Mr. Shen,

181
00:08:21,920 --> 00:08:22,560
aren't you supposed to

182
00:08:22,560 --> 00:08:24,240
depart for the capital
for the imperial examination?

183
00:08:24,600 --> 00:08:25,270
It's fine.

184
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:27,000
I just wanted to check on things.

185
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:28,920
Don't worry.

186
00:08:29,040 --> 00:08:30,160
She's careful.

187
00:08:30,800 --> 00:08:31,560
Even without us,

188
00:08:31,720 --> 00:08:32,510
she'll be safe.

189
00:08:32,510 --> 00:08:33,080
Shumeng.

190
00:08:33,510 --> 00:08:34,120
Shumeng.

191
00:08:34,200 --> 00:08:34,910
Come here.

192
00:08:35,080 --> 00:08:35,870
Listen,

193
00:08:40,080 --> 00:08:42,000
this sleeping draught looks too dark.

194
00:08:42,120 --> 00:08:43,910
Use less of it later.

195
00:08:44,510 --> 00:08:46,480
When Ms. Rong

196
00:08:46,840 --> 00:08:49,960
finds Qiuyue sleeps like a log
during inspection,

197
00:08:50,360 --> 00:08:51,720
she'll have her expelled.

198
00:08:52,240 --> 00:08:53,000
Liuli,

199
00:08:53,030 --> 00:08:54,910
possessing the prohibited drug
is a grave offense.

200
00:08:55,030 --> 00:08:56,150
You're making me administer it.

201
00:08:56,150 --> 00:08:56,550
It's...

202
00:08:56,550 --> 00:08:58,750
I'm keeping watch for you.

203
00:08:59,150 --> 00:09:00,080
Relax.

204
00:09:00,480 --> 00:09:01,600
I wouldn't harm you.

205
00:09:03,840 --> 00:09:04,480
Do you think

206
00:09:04,480 --> 00:09:05,790
the First Madam

207
00:09:05,960 --> 00:09:07,660
will choose us after Qiuyue's gone?

208
00:09:12,390 --> 00:09:13,780
Qiuyue isn't the only one

209
00:09:14,990 --> 00:09:16,470
I want to get rid of.

210
00:09:16,940 --> 00:09:18,150
Go. Now.

211
00:09:18,150 --> 00:09:18,510
Hurry.

212
00:09:36,390 --> 00:09:37,900
They had the audacity to break the rules

213
00:09:38,780 --> 00:09:40,630
just for a maid's position.

214
00:09:40,990 --> 00:09:43,300
The mansion pays
triple the workshop's wages.

215
00:09:43,900 --> 00:09:45,630
You should pretend
you never saw this, Mr. Shen.

216
00:09:46,110 --> 00:09:47,020
Your father

217
00:09:47,180 --> 00:09:48,750
has high expectations
for this imperial examination.

218
00:09:49,270 --> 00:09:51,470
If the madams find out
about your midnight visits at workshop,

219
00:09:51,870 --> 00:09:52,750
I'm afraid

220
00:09:52,750 --> 00:09:54,390
they'll start trouble.

221
00:09:56,110 --> 00:09:57,700
Is this Qiuyue the girl

222
00:09:58,540 --> 00:09:59,870
always

223
00:10:00,110 --> 00:10:02,230
keeping Su Yunqing company?

224
00:10:15,940 --> 00:10:18,270
I've hidden osmanthus honey here.

225
00:10:18,270 --> 00:10:19,020
Very sweet.

226
00:10:19,270 --> 00:10:19,900
Try it.

227
00:10:20,180 --> 00:10:21,110
I don't want it.

228
00:10:24,270 --> 00:10:26,350
Hasn't anyone taught you
not to eat things randomly?

229
00:10:30,180 --> 00:10:31,300
Mr. Shen.

230
00:10:34,060 --> 00:10:35,060
What are you doing here?

231
00:10:41,900 --> 00:10:42,780
Qiuyue?

232
00:10:59,150 --> 00:10:59,900
Who's there?

233
00:11:09,470 --> 00:11:09,870
Show yourself.
