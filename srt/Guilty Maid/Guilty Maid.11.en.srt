00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:10,080
[Guilty Maid]
[Episode 11]

2
00:00:18,480 --> 00:00:19,440
Su Yunqing,

3
00:00:20,070 --> 00:00:21,480
you actually hurt yourself with pollen

4
00:00:21,960 --> 00:00:23,960
to hide your identity.

5
00:00:27,070 --> 00:00:28,230
Who's Su Yunqing?

6
00:00:28,670 --> 00:00:30,230
I don't know what you're talking about.

7
00:00:30,800 --> 00:00:31,440
It's just that

8
00:00:31,440 --> 00:00:32,920
my previous wounds haven't fully healed.

9
00:00:33,920 --> 00:00:35,280
I was afraid you'd find me disgusting,

10
00:00:35,670 --> 00:00:36,840
so I...

11
00:00:40,150 --> 00:00:42,030
Everywhere else has healed,

12
00:00:42,880 --> 00:00:45,150
except the scar with your sigil.

13
00:00:45,840 --> 00:00:46,880
Su Yunqing,

14
00:00:47,070 --> 00:00:48,000
your acting

15
00:00:48,240 --> 00:00:49,430
is truly awkward.

16
00:00:50,350 --> 00:00:51,070
I never said

17
00:00:51,070 --> 00:00:52,960
all my injuries have recovered.

18
00:00:53,880 --> 00:00:54,670
Fine then.

19
00:00:55,670 --> 00:00:56,390
Let me check

20
00:00:56,390 --> 00:00:57,710
if your other wounds

21
00:00:58,840 --> 00:01:00,240
have healed or not.

22
00:01:00,750 --> 00:01:01,750
You shameless!

23
00:01:02,280 --> 00:01:03,110
What are you doing?

24
00:01:03,280 --> 00:01:04,200
Put me down!

25
00:01:04,400 --> 00:01:05,400
I said put me down!

26
00:01:05,950 --> 00:01:06,790
Hands off me!

27
00:01:06,790 --> 00:01:07,840
Shen Xingyan, don't touch me!

28
00:01:07,840 --> 00:01:09,000
I'm your husband.

29
00:01:09,070 --> 00:01:10,070
What's shameless about that?

30
00:01:12,040 --> 00:01:12,840
Shen Xingyan,

31
00:01:13,230 --> 00:01:14,120
I'm warning you.

32
00:01:14,310 --> 00:01:15,200
If you come any closer,

33
00:01:15,200 --> 00:01:16,560
I swear I'll kill you!

34
00:01:16,920 --> 00:01:18,710
You wanted this yesterday,

35
00:01:18,870 --> 00:01:20,430
but today you don't let me touch you.

36
00:01:20,590 --> 00:01:22,000
You change your mind awfully fast.

37
00:01:22,350 --> 00:01:23,480
Let me go!

38
00:01:23,920 --> 00:01:24,950
Let go!

39
00:01:58,680 --> 00:02:00,280
I'm not interested

40
00:02:00,350 --> 00:02:01,560
in the rest of you.

41
00:02:01,950 --> 00:02:02,870
From now on,

42
00:02:03,640 --> 00:02:04,870
I'll come daily to apply your medicine.

43
00:02:16,310 --> 00:02:17,120
First Madam,

44
00:02:17,280 --> 00:02:18,430
I'm here to pay respects to you.

45
00:02:18,750 --> 00:02:19,910
Thank you for your kindness

46
00:02:19,910 --> 00:02:21,120
all these years.

47
00:02:21,120 --> 00:02:21,910
Rise.

48
00:02:22,470 --> 00:02:24,150
Ms. Liu told me

49
00:02:24,240 --> 00:02:26,400
there's a clever girl named Qiuyue

50
00:02:26,680 --> 00:02:28,190
in the workshop.

51
00:02:28,430 --> 00:02:29,630
Now that I see you,

52
00:02:29,750 --> 00:02:31,310
you are indeed delightful.

53
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:33,430
Thank you for your favor, First Madam.

54
00:02:33,910 --> 00:02:34,800
What a pity...

55
00:02:34,840 --> 00:02:36,240
Having you serve me

56
00:02:36,680 --> 00:02:39,360
is a waste of your beauty.

57
00:02:39,560 --> 00:02:40,240
First Madam, you...

58
00:02:40,310 --> 00:02:41,150
What if

59
00:02:41,870 --> 00:02:43,590
I made you Shen Xingyan's wife?

60
00:02:43,840 --> 00:02:45,240
Would you dare to try?

61
00:02:47,710 --> 00:02:49,630
Hasn't anyone taught you
not to eat things randomly?

62
00:02:54,030 --> 00:02:55,560
What grievance troubles you?

63
00:02:55,840 --> 00:02:57,590
Someone drugged my congee.

64
00:02:57,590 --> 00:02:59,910
Yet Ms. Rong insists we were drinking.

65
00:03:00,240 --> 00:03:03,400
She slapped and struck us.

66
00:03:04,120 --> 00:03:05,360
It hurts terribly.

67
00:03:05,590 --> 00:03:06,360
Don't worry.

68
00:03:07,560 --> 00:03:09,150
I'll do you justice.

69
00:03:10,750 --> 00:03:11,960
But Miss Zhou

70
00:03:13,190 --> 00:03:15,080
is his wife now.

71
00:03:15,280 --> 00:03:16,150
Relax.

72
00:03:16,590 --> 00:03:19,120
He's not into her.

73
00:03:19,280 --> 00:03:20,840
With my help,

74
00:03:21,190 --> 00:03:23,870
stealing him from her is easy.

75
00:03:24,430 --> 00:03:25,430
If you get pregnant with his child

76
00:03:25,430 --> 00:03:27,590
before Zhou Furong does,

77
00:03:28,310 --> 00:03:30,400
I promise I'll make you his wife.

78
00:03:30,960 --> 00:03:32,120
But this child must be

79
00:03:32,430 --> 00:03:33,750
given to me to raise.

80
00:03:34,310 --> 00:03:35,560
Are you willing to do that?

81
00:03:36,750 --> 00:03:37,870
Yes, I am.

82
00:03:44,560 --> 00:03:45,870
Shen Xingyan,

83
00:03:46,240 --> 00:03:47,870
what kind of man are you?

84
00:03:48,910 --> 00:03:50,870
Your cruelty terrifies me,

85
00:03:51,360 --> 00:03:52,470
yet your tenderness

86
00:03:52,870 --> 00:03:55,680
feels so strangely familiar.

87
00:03:59,080 --> 00:04:00,840
You blind fool!

88
00:04:00,870 --> 00:04:02,840
I told you to deliver tonic
to Mrs. Shen,

89
00:04:03,120 --> 00:04:04,030
and you spilled it

90
00:04:04,150 --> 00:04:06,150
all over Mr. Shen!

91
00:04:06,360 --> 00:04:06,910
Oh,

92
00:04:07,430 --> 00:04:07,910
you...

93
00:04:08,120 --> 00:04:08,560
You...

94
00:04:08,750 --> 00:04:09,150
You!

95
00:04:09,470 --> 00:04:11,840
How could we have such an idiot!

96
00:04:13,560 --> 00:04:14,400
Qiuyue?

97
00:04:14,910 --> 00:04:16,560
She's finally entered the Shen family?

98
00:04:16,720 --> 00:04:18,430
Beg Mr. Shen for mercy now!

99
00:04:18,430 --> 00:04:19,160
What a stupid maid!

100
00:04:19,160 --> 00:04:20,120
Mr. Shen, spare me!

101
00:04:20,270 --> 00:04:21,630
I'll never do it again!

102
00:04:21,750 --> 00:04:22,870
Please forgive me!

103
00:04:22,870 --> 00:04:23,600
Stop it!

104
00:04:25,560 --> 00:04:26,720
What's going on here?

105
00:04:27,750 --> 00:04:29,240
This useless maid

106
00:04:29,240 --> 00:04:31,120
ruined Mr. Shen's clothes!

107
00:04:31,240 --> 00:04:31,950
Such an idiot!

108
00:04:31,950 --> 00:04:33,000
I said stop it!

109
00:04:35,630 --> 00:04:36,920
If the clothes got dirty,

110
00:04:36,950 --> 00:04:38,160
just wash them.

111
00:04:38,310 --> 00:04:39,480
It's no big deal.

112
00:04:39,720 --> 00:04:42,270
Mrs. Shen, you're overstepping a bit.

113
00:04:42,430 --> 00:04:43,950
She's not even your maid.

114
00:04:44,070 --> 00:04:46,630
First Madam prepared tonic for you,

115
00:04:46,800 --> 00:04:48,390
and this fool spilled it!

116
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:50,600
She wasn't my maid before,

117
00:04:50,830 --> 00:04:52,040
but she is now.

118
00:04:52,750 --> 00:04:54,560
As Mrs. Shen,

119
00:04:54,560 --> 00:04:56,600
asking for a maid isn't too much, is it?

120
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:58,480
From now on, she serves me.

121
00:04:58,680 --> 00:04:59,270
Qiuyue,

122
00:04:59,430 --> 00:05:00,310
let's go.

123
00:05:03,720 --> 00:05:04,600
Mr. Shen,

124
00:05:04,630 --> 00:05:06,000
won't you discipline your wife?

125
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:06,800
She's right.

126
00:05:07,310 --> 00:05:09,040
She's my wife now,

127
00:05:09,040 --> 00:05:10,750
so she deserves a personal maid.

128
00:05:12,040 --> 00:05:13,600
Please tell First Madam

129
00:05:13,600 --> 00:05:16,040
the tonic is tasty.

130
00:05:16,270 --> 00:05:17,040
Yes.

131
00:05:20,190 --> 00:05:21,360
Not once

132
00:05:21,950 --> 00:05:23,870
did anyone say her name was Qiuyue.

133
00:05:25,600 --> 00:05:27,120
How did you know?

134
00:05:30,560 --> 00:05:31,430
Mr. Shen.

135
00:05:31,870 --> 00:05:34,310
Any findings about Qiuyue's background?

136
00:05:37,750 --> 00:05:38,480
She used to be

137
00:05:38,480 --> 00:05:39,630
a workshop worker.

138
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:41,270
Later, for her great skill,

139
00:05:41,310 --> 00:05:42,750
First Madam took notice of her.

140
00:05:42,920 --> 00:05:44,600
She's Su Yunqing's only friend.

141
00:05:45,360 --> 00:05:46,600
You've likely met her before,

142
00:05:46,600 --> 00:05:47,480
but you just forgot.

143
00:05:48,920 --> 00:05:49,750
As expected.

144
00:05:50,630 --> 00:05:51,600
At this point,

145
00:05:51,920 --> 00:05:53,720
I wonder what excuses you will make.

146
00:06:13,270 --> 00:06:15,680
You secretly applied pollen again.

147
00:06:19,680 --> 00:06:20,750
Did you really think

148
00:06:21,920 --> 00:06:23,870
you could fool me forever?

149
00:06:25,040 --> 00:06:26,950
You want to know

150
00:06:27,240 --> 00:06:29,560
what I said to your sister

151
00:06:29,950 --> 00:06:31,120
and what I did to her.

152
00:06:32,630 --> 00:06:34,120
I don't know what you mean.

153
00:06:45,920 --> 00:06:47,390
If you were truly Zhou Furong,

154
00:06:48,040 --> 00:06:49,310
I wouldn't care

155
00:06:50,040 --> 00:06:51,600
if you lived or died.

156
00:06:51,920 --> 00:06:54,070
But if you're Su Yunqing,

157
00:06:54,630 --> 00:06:55,720
I won't allow

158
00:06:56,160 --> 00:06:57,830
you to harm yourself.

159
00:06:59,920 --> 00:07:01,070
Who is Su Yunqing?

160
00:07:01,920 --> 00:07:04,070
Now you've made me even more curious.

161
00:07:07,430 --> 00:07:09,160
You think besides the sigil,

162
00:07:09,560 --> 00:07:10,720
I have no other way

163
00:07:10,720 --> 00:07:12,360
to prove who you are?

164
00:07:14,920 --> 00:07:15,720
Fine.

165
00:07:16,480 --> 00:07:18,360
Then I'll send your dearest friend

166
00:07:19,070 --> 00:07:20,950
to the mass graves.

167
00:07:22,720 --> 00:07:24,600
Qiuyue is my best friend.

168
00:07:24,830 --> 00:07:25,830
If you hurt her,

169
00:07:26,310 --> 00:07:27,430
I'll kill you!

170
00:07:33,310 --> 00:07:34,070
Good.

171
00:07:35,830 --> 00:07:37,600
Then I'll give you the chance.

172
00:07:39,680 --> 00:07:40,480
Do it.

173
00:07:42,270 --> 00:07:43,560
If you don't let go,

174
00:07:43,720 --> 00:07:45,070
I swear I'll kill you!

175
00:07:47,560 --> 00:07:48,430
Are you crazy?

176
00:07:48,560 --> 00:07:49,680
Have you lost your mind?

177
00:07:58,480 --> 00:07:59,870
If you were really Zhou Furong,

178
00:08:00,630 --> 00:08:02,270
you wouldn't panic

179
00:08:02,480 --> 00:08:03,830
when hurting someone.

180
00:08:05,560 --> 00:08:07,240
I should've recognized you sooner.

181
00:08:13,830 --> 00:08:14,680
I'm sorry.

182
00:08:28,480 --> 00:08:29,630
I'll go get the medicine.

183
00:08:31,950 --> 00:08:33,120
Weren't you going to kill me?

184
00:08:36,150 --> 00:08:38,120
What did you do to my sister?

185
00:08:38,440 --> 00:08:40,120
Where is she now?

186
00:08:40,960 --> 00:08:42,030
I didn't harm her.

187
00:08:43,670 --> 00:08:44,750
And I'd never harm you.

188
00:09:15,150 --> 00:09:16,320
My sister's situation

189
00:09:16,600 --> 00:09:17,790
seems far more complicated

190
00:09:17,790 --> 00:09:19,080
than I imagined.

191
00:09:20,120 --> 00:09:21,630
Is she even alive?

192
00:09:22,360 --> 00:09:23,790
Where is she now?

193
00:09:30,200 --> 00:09:31,720
Su Zhaohua.
