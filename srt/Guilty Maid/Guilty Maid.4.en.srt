00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:10,080
[Guilty Maid]
[Episode 4]

2
00:00:12,220 --> 00:00:13,020
Wei Xian!

3
00:00:16,780 --> 00:00:17,700
Wei Xian?

4
00:00:22,140 --> 00:00:23,020
Wei Xian?

5
00:00:32,340 --> 00:00:33,580
Wei Xian?

6
00:00:34,380 --> 00:00:35,900
So there really was a man.

7
00:00:36,620 --> 00:00:38,420
I'll report this to the Third Madam.

8
00:00:38,420 --> 00:00:39,900
This will earn me great favor.

9
00:00:47,820 --> 00:00:49,820
So the Third Madam never

10
00:00:49,980 --> 00:00:51,660
intended to let me go.

11
00:00:52,060 --> 00:00:53,940
This was all part of her scheme.

12
00:00:55,740 --> 00:00:57,180
I underestimated her.

13
00:01:11,820 --> 00:01:12,620
A rabbit?

14
00:01:20,820 --> 00:01:21,620
Wei Xian,

15
00:01:22,620 --> 00:01:23,900
is Liuli with you?

16
00:01:24,740 --> 00:01:26,060
Stay out of this.

17
00:01:27,140 --> 00:01:28,180
Don't act rashly.

18
00:01:28,580 --> 00:01:29,580
Don't stop me.

19
00:01:29,580 --> 00:01:30,620
I'll kill her!

20
00:01:31,100 --> 00:01:32,660
Don't let others manipulate you.

21
00:01:32,780 --> 00:01:34,620
A jade pendant proves nothing.

22
00:01:35,100 --> 00:01:36,500
Anyone associated with the Third Madam

23
00:01:36,620 --> 00:01:38,180
must die.

24
00:01:38,180 --> 00:01:38,660
Wei Xian,

25
00:01:38,980 --> 00:01:40,380
I want revenge too.

26
00:01:40,460 --> 00:01:41,940
But now is not the time.

27
00:01:41,940 --> 00:01:43,580
Patience is key to big plans.

28
00:01:44,020 --> 00:01:45,380
What shameless adulterers

29
00:01:45,380 --> 00:01:48,180
are making out in the dead of night?

30
00:01:51,260 --> 00:01:51,940
If it isn't

31
00:01:51,940 --> 00:01:54,260
the Fourth Madam,
carrying the Shen family's heir.

32
00:01:57,740 --> 00:01:59,700
Soak the rope in vegetable juice.

33
00:01:59,780 --> 00:02:01,020
It might work.

34
00:02:05,140 --> 00:02:06,180
Bunny,

35
00:02:06,460 --> 00:02:07,620
help me.

36
00:02:09,900 --> 00:02:10,740
Hurry!

37
00:02:13,780 --> 00:02:14,860
There's no time.

38
00:02:24,460 --> 00:02:25,940
What brings the two dear madams here?

39
00:02:26,180 --> 00:02:27,300
Drop the act.

40
00:02:27,300 --> 00:02:27,980
Shameless.

41
00:02:28,500 --> 00:02:30,860
With the Master away, you sneak out
to fool around with men.

42
00:02:31,140 --> 00:02:32,180
Xingyan

43
00:02:32,340 --> 00:02:33,500
will soon be the top scholar.

44
00:02:33,900 --> 00:02:35,860
If he ends up calling
an illegitimate child his brother,

45
00:02:35,860 --> 00:02:36,940
won't that be a joke?

46
00:02:38,580 --> 00:02:40,460
The Second Madam's words
may lack refinement,

47
00:02:40,500 --> 00:02:42,020
but the truth in them is plain.

48
00:02:42,220 --> 00:02:44,500
It was your pregnancy
with the Master's child

49
00:02:44,500 --> 00:02:45,860
that secured you the title.

50
00:02:46,220 --> 00:02:47,740
Given the current situation,

51
00:02:47,900 --> 00:02:48,660
that title

52
00:02:48,660 --> 00:02:50,820
may have been granted too hastily.

53
00:02:57,780 --> 00:02:59,060
Don't you slander me.

54
00:02:59,260 --> 00:03:01,500
Whether this child is the Master's,

55
00:03:01,500 --> 00:03:02,860
he knows best.

56
00:03:03,580 --> 00:03:04,900
With him away,

57
00:03:05,020 --> 00:03:06,460
if anything happens to me,

58
00:03:06,660 --> 00:03:08,220
he'll hold every one of you accountable!

59
00:03:08,700 --> 00:03:10,460
The Third Madam ruined countless lives

60
00:03:10,660 --> 00:03:12,020
with her wicked deeds.

61
00:03:12,820 --> 00:03:15,020
Fourth Madam prioritizes
self-preservation,

62
00:03:15,220 --> 00:03:16,900
but she still possesses kindness.

63
00:03:17,860 --> 00:03:20,380
If Shen Xingyan refuses
to tell me the truth,

64
00:03:20,740 --> 00:03:23,020
perhaps I can find clues through her.

65
00:03:23,740 --> 00:03:24,780
With the Master absent

66
00:03:25,180 --> 00:03:26,460
and the First Madam not present,

67
00:03:28,580 --> 00:03:29,300
well,

68
00:03:29,300 --> 00:03:30,380
why don't you

69
00:03:30,380 --> 00:03:32,740
assume the role
of the lady of the house instead?

70
00:03:32,820 --> 00:03:34,500
I'm sure

71
00:03:34,500 --> 00:03:35,820
the First Madam'd be grateful.

72
00:03:36,580 --> 00:03:37,500
You're right.

73
00:03:38,060 --> 00:03:38,900
Qingqiu,

74
00:03:38,900 --> 00:03:41,260
it's my rightful duty to discipline you.

75
00:03:41,260 --> 00:03:41,860
You two,

76
00:03:41,860 --> 00:03:42,900
seize them!

77
00:03:43,340 --> 00:03:44,060
Fourth Madam.

78
00:03:45,620 --> 00:03:46,140
Fourth Madam,

79
00:03:46,700 --> 00:03:47,220
there is

80
00:03:47,620 --> 00:03:48,780
no need to shield me any longer.

81
00:03:48,940 --> 00:03:49,700
Liuli?

82
00:03:50,100 --> 00:03:51,020
Madams,

83
00:03:51,020 --> 00:03:52,140
you got it wrong.

84
00:03:52,340 --> 00:03:53,380
Actually,

85
00:03:53,660 --> 00:03:55,580
I've long admired this man.

86
00:03:55,580 --> 00:03:56,220
That's why

87
00:03:56,420 --> 00:03:58,260
I've been meeting him in secret.

88
00:03:58,340 --> 00:04:00,300
The Fourth Madam is worried about me,

89
00:04:00,300 --> 00:04:01,940
fearing I'll be pregnant
before marriage,

90
00:04:02,140 --> 00:04:03,300
so she's come

91
00:04:03,780 --> 00:04:05,500
to help me secure a proper status.

92
00:04:09,500 --> 00:04:10,220
Mr. Shen,

93
00:04:10,420 --> 00:04:11,460
your injuries are serious.

94
00:04:12,100 --> 00:04:14,300
We don't even know if the Fourth Madam
is truly Su Yunqing.

95
00:04:14,460 --> 00:04:15,340
There's no need for you to...

96
00:04:15,340 --> 00:04:16,780
That man's name is Wei Xian, right?

97
00:04:17,300 --> 00:04:17,860
Yes.

98
00:04:20,220 --> 00:04:21,780
Remember your place.

99
00:04:22,140 --> 00:04:23,740
I sent you to serve her temporarily.

100
00:04:23,980 --> 00:04:25,460
Did you truly see her as your madam?

101
00:04:25,460 --> 00:04:26,820
Why complicate things?

102
00:04:27,300 --> 00:04:29,020
If I say Qingqiu
fooled around with a guy,

103
00:04:29,020 --> 00:04:30,180
then she did!

104
00:04:30,460 --> 00:04:31,260
You two,

105
00:04:31,380 --> 00:04:32,660
drag this insolent girl back

106
00:04:32,660 --> 00:04:33,580
and interrogate her thoroughly!

107
00:04:33,860 --> 00:04:34,420
Now!

108
00:04:35,180 --> 00:04:35,860
Who dares?

109
00:04:36,180 --> 00:04:36,900
Why don't we dare?

110
00:04:37,580 --> 00:04:39,900
We witnessed everything.

111
00:04:39,940 --> 00:04:41,260
Do you think the Master would doubt us?

112
00:04:41,460 --> 00:04:42,100
Do it!

113
00:04:44,220 --> 00:04:45,100
Wei Xian,

114
00:04:45,100 --> 00:04:46,740
what's with all the guests today?

115
00:04:48,700 --> 00:04:50,260
Shen Xingyan's guard?

116
00:04:51,500 --> 00:04:52,980
He must be nearby.

117
00:04:53,180 --> 00:04:55,220
He sent his guard instead coming
in person for convenience.

118
00:04:56,380 --> 00:04:58,500
But he doesn't know I'm Su Yunqing.

119
00:04:59,380 --> 00:05:00,140
Is he here

120
00:05:00,260 --> 00:05:02,300
to help the Fourth Madam?

121
00:05:06,260 --> 00:05:07,020
Liuli,

122
00:05:07,020 --> 00:05:07,940
it's been days.

123
00:05:07,940 --> 00:05:08,820
You've become even more beautiful.

124
00:05:09,700 --> 00:05:10,580
You flatter me.

125
00:05:11,860 --> 00:05:13,140
And these ladies are...?

126
00:05:13,500 --> 00:05:15,180
They're the Shen family's madams.

127
00:05:15,300 --> 00:05:16,820
They've heard about me and Wei Xian

128
00:05:17,220 --> 00:05:18,500
and come to offer guidance.

129
00:05:19,860 --> 00:05:20,980
Ah, esteemed guests from Shen family.

130
00:05:21,380 --> 00:05:22,340
My apologies for lack of respect.

131
00:05:22,860 --> 00:05:24,180
This involves an outsider now.

132
00:05:24,300 --> 00:05:25,460
It might tarnish
the Shen family's reputation.

133
00:05:25,460 --> 00:05:26,340
What's there to fear?

134
00:05:26,660 --> 00:05:27,300
By the way,

135
00:05:27,580 --> 00:05:29,700
the manager and staff from Xingyuan Bank

136
00:05:29,700 --> 00:05:30,260
are behind us.

137
00:05:32,500 --> 00:05:33,420
Well,

138
00:05:33,740 --> 00:05:35,420
perhaps we should call it a day?

139
00:05:36,300 --> 00:05:37,460
Are we just giving up like this?

140
00:05:38,980 --> 00:05:40,220
If outsiders see this,

141
00:05:40,220 --> 00:05:41,140
we'll be the laughingstock.

142
00:05:41,180 --> 00:05:42,340
And when the Master knows

143
00:05:42,500 --> 00:05:43,780
and demands answers,

144
00:05:44,580 --> 00:05:45,740
who will take responsibility?

145
00:05:47,620 --> 00:05:48,260
Liuli,

146
00:05:48,260 --> 00:05:49,100
come back with me.

147
00:05:49,100 --> 00:05:50,100
She's coming with me!

148
00:05:52,900 --> 00:05:54,220
Remember who hold

149
00:05:54,220 --> 00:05:55,620
your contract.

150
00:06:01,580 --> 00:06:02,780
Where did he go?

151
00:06:03,580 --> 00:06:04,220
No.

152
00:06:04,220 --> 00:06:05,180
Move!

153
00:06:05,180 --> 00:06:07,100
Still remember our three-month pact?
