[Guilty Maid]
[Episode 23]

2
00:00:12,920 --> 00:00:14,000
You two may go now.

3
00:00:14,230 --> 00:00:15,070
Without my order,

4
00:00:15,070 --> 00:00:16,200
don't let anyone in.

5
00:00:18,520 --> 00:00:19,320
Ms. Rong,

6
00:00:20,040 --> 00:00:22,110
how long have we been together?

7
00:00:24,270 --> 00:00:25,160
Do you still remember?

8
00:00:25,800 --> 00:00:27,710
We've been together since we were kids.

9
00:00:28,360 --> 00:00:29,840
Even after my family fell into decline,

10
00:00:30,070 --> 00:00:31,270
I never cast you aside.

11
00:00:32,360 --> 00:00:33,790
I've always remembered

12
00:00:33,920 --> 00:00:35,470
that you love mooncakes.

13
00:00:35,920 --> 00:00:36,830
Even if I didn't eat any myself,

14
00:00:37,790 --> 00:00:39,430
I'd save a few extra pieces for you.

15
00:00:40,320 --> 00:00:41,240
Later,

16
00:00:41,430 --> 00:00:43,190
you accompanied me to the Shen family.

17
00:00:45,430 --> 00:00:47,600
Even the maids dared to bully me.

18
00:00:48,390 --> 00:00:50,470
Yet every time, you shielded me.

19
00:00:50,470 --> 00:00:53,000
I wouldn't be surprised
at betrayal from anyone else.

20
00:00:53,750 --> 00:00:54,790
But you.

21
00:00:56,040 --> 00:00:57,280
I can't understand

22
00:00:57,880 --> 00:00:59,510
why you would betray me.

23
00:00:59,510 --> 00:01:01,360
Not everyone

24
00:01:01,790 --> 00:01:03,320
is as selfish

25
00:01:03,360 --> 00:01:04,630
and wicked as you are.

26
00:01:06,390 --> 00:01:08,040
I'm wicked?

27
00:01:10,880 --> 00:01:11,990
I don't understand.

28
00:01:13,630 --> 00:01:14,910
I don't understand!

29
00:01:16,160 --> 00:01:17,630
What did the Fourth Madam promise you

30
00:01:17,630 --> 00:01:18,750
that made you betray me?

31
00:01:21,960 --> 00:01:23,440
What's your plan?

32
00:01:50,320 --> 00:01:52,520
An ordinary physician
might be powerless.

33
00:01:53,040 --> 00:01:54,880
But the Su family has a method.

34
00:01:55,270 --> 00:01:56,270
Dare you try?

35
00:02:17,160 --> 00:02:19,510
Knowing fate denies us,
I dare not linger.

36
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:23,720
How could I vie

37
00:02:24,750 --> 00:02:25,950
with blossoms dancing free?

38
00:02:27,510 --> 00:02:29,320
I can arrange for you to work
at the Shen family workshop.

39
00:02:30,040 --> 00:02:31,070
If you can

40
00:02:31,320 --> 00:02:34,120
enter the main house within three months

41
00:02:34,470 --> 00:02:36,190
and step into this room again,

42
00:02:37,230 --> 00:02:38,720
I'll tell you the truth.

43
00:02:40,400 --> 00:02:42,190
If you seek something,

44
00:02:42,280 --> 00:02:44,720
you must contend
with both the heaven and men.

45
00:02:45,190 --> 00:02:46,350
If this displeases you,

46
00:02:46,750 --> 00:02:48,910
you can leave now.

47
00:02:49,910 --> 00:02:51,400
I've saved you countless times.

48
00:02:51,510 --> 00:02:53,070
You save me once

49
00:02:53,190 --> 00:02:54,470
and expect praise?

50
00:02:56,040 --> 00:02:57,120
Everything I've done

51
00:02:57,470 --> 00:02:58,720
has been to protect you.

52
00:03:00,160 --> 00:03:01,040
I promise you,

53
00:03:01,350 --> 00:03:02,880
whether it's your sister's situation

54
00:03:03,120 --> 00:03:04,470
or the curse upon you,

55
00:03:04,910 --> 00:03:06,320
I will exhaust every means

56
00:03:06,750 --> 00:03:07,910
to help you.

57
00:03:08,230 --> 00:03:09,230
Yunqing,

58
00:03:09,720 --> 00:03:10,910
I'm sorry.

59
00:03:11,470 --> 00:03:13,840
I failed your trust.

60
00:03:15,070 --> 00:03:16,440
It's all my fault

61
00:03:17,510 --> 00:03:18,910
for not being able to protect you.

62
00:03:20,720 --> 00:03:21,350
Mr. Shen,

63
00:03:21,840 --> 00:03:23,670
the assassin has been handed over
to the authorities.

64
00:03:23,670 --> 00:03:26,510
All the evidence we've collected
has also been submitted.

65
00:03:26,910 --> 00:03:28,550
Those who brought ruin
upon the Shen family

66
00:03:28,550 --> 00:03:29,420
and murdered the Master

67
00:03:29,420 --> 00:03:31,160
will be punished.

68
00:03:33,470 --> 00:03:36,000
Qiuyue and the First Madam
have also been laid to rest.

69
00:03:36,720 --> 00:03:37,510
I'm sorry for your loss.

70
00:03:41,350 --> 00:03:42,000
Mr. Shen.

71
00:03:58,400 --> 00:03:59,320
Su Yunqing,

72
00:03:59,750 --> 00:04:00,880
I'm sorry.

73
00:04:02,070 --> 00:04:03,000
It's all my fault

74
00:04:04,750 --> 00:04:06,230
for not being able to protect you.

75
00:04:07,400 --> 00:04:09,230
I'll make those who harmed you

76
00:04:11,160 --> 00:04:12,750
pay the price.

77
00:04:16,640 --> 00:04:17,280
If

78
00:04:17,470 --> 00:04:19,110
I hadn't been on my guard this time,

79
00:04:19,200 --> 00:04:20,840
I would have been sold out by you.

80
00:04:21,040 --> 00:04:22,280
Even now,

81
00:04:23,870 --> 00:04:24,910
you're still not going to speak up?

82
00:04:27,350 --> 00:04:28,230
Why is it blank?

83
00:04:28,310 --> 00:04:30,080
After all these years by my side,

84
00:04:30,230 --> 00:04:31,310
you should know exactly

85
00:04:31,430 --> 00:04:32,470
what I'm capable of.

86
00:04:35,520 --> 00:04:36,430
Too bad

87
00:04:36,820 --> 00:04:38,260
you overlooked one detail.

88
00:04:41,940 --> 00:04:43,020
What are you talking about?

89
00:04:43,260 --> 00:04:44,180
You don't have

90
00:04:44,620 --> 00:04:45,820
that set of keys on you, do you?

91
00:04:46,980 --> 00:04:48,140
If I recall correctly,

92
00:04:48,260 --> 00:04:49,420
those keys

93
00:04:49,420 --> 00:04:51,260
can also open another wooden box, right?

94
00:05:02,420 --> 00:05:03,380
You two may go now.

95
00:05:03,740 --> 00:05:04,620
Without my order,

96
00:05:04,620 --> 00:05:05,820
don't let anyone in.

97
00:05:06,140 --> 00:05:06,660
Understood.

98
00:05:22,660 --> 00:05:23,580
Madam,

99
00:05:23,580 --> 00:05:25,100
you hid the most critical evidence

100
00:05:25,100 --> 00:05:27,140
right under everyone's noses.

101
00:05:27,260 --> 00:05:29,180
Bold move indeed.

102
00:05:29,180 --> 00:05:29,740
You!

103
00:05:32,460 --> 00:05:33,380
With

104
00:05:33,380 --> 00:05:35,340
both witnesses and evidence now in hand,

105
00:05:35,740 --> 00:05:37,380
[Account Book]
what defense do you have left?

106
00:05:38,300 --> 00:05:39,020
Impossible.

107
00:05:39,460 --> 00:05:40,260
Impossible.

108
00:05:42,820 --> 00:05:44,740
Now that the First Madam is dead,

109
00:05:45,340 --> 00:05:47,980
if we can find evidence
that the Third Madam hired assassins,

110
00:05:48,420 --> 00:05:50,220
we can send her to the authorities.

111
00:05:50,660 --> 00:05:51,940
Given your current position,

112
00:05:51,980 --> 00:05:53,060
it shouldn't be difficult.

113
00:05:53,060 --> 00:05:55,020
I noticed the Third Madam
keeps a ledger.

114
00:05:55,380 --> 00:05:58,860
It likely holds evidence of her usury
and assassin hiring.

115
00:05:59,140 --> 00:06:00,660
The Third Madam is naturally suspicious

116
00:06:00,740 --> 00:06:01,660
and cunning.

117
00:06:02,500 --> 00:06:03,940
We must never take risks

118
00:06:04,740 --> 00:06:05,940
without absolute certainty.

119
00:06:07,420 --> 00:06:08,580
What's your plan?

120
00:06:09,060 --> 00:06:10,500
I need Wei Xian's help.

121
00:06:11,300 --> 00:06:12,860
If we secure the evidence,

122
00:06:12,900 --> 00:06:13,820
all the better.

123
00:06:15,020 --> 00:06:16,220
If not,

124
00:06:17,620 --> 00:06:19,460
I have a way
to trick her into exposing it.

125
00:06:20,780 --> 00:06:22,380
The handwriting in the secret accounts

126
00:06:23,260 --> 00:06:24,420
matches that in the ledger.

127
00:06:27,340 --> 00:06:28,300
Now that

128
00:06:28,300 --> 00:06:31,100
we have evidence of your usury
and assassin hiring.

129
00:06:31,220 --> 00:06:34,060
Save your explanations
for the authorities.

130
00:06:37,540 --> 00:06:38,380
Nobody move!
