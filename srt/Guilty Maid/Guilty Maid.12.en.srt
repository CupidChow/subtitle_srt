00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:10,080
[Guilty Maid]
[Episode 12]

2
00:00:17,480 --> 00:00:18,600
Su Zhaohua.

3
00:00:19,640 --> 00:00:22,030
Mr. Shen, you act like
you've seen a ghost.

4
00:00:23,830 --> 00:00:25,670
You dare step into my place again?

5
00:00:26,120 --> 00:00:27,670
Not afraid of dying a second time?

6
00:00:29,830 --> 00:00:31,230
I heard someone's been

7
00:00:31,230 --> 00:00:32,470
asking about my whereabouts lately.

8
00:00:32,790 --> 00:00:33,790
Turns out,

9
00:00:33,920 --> 00:00:35,350
it was you, Mr. Shen.

10
00:00:36,470 --> 00:00:37,150
What?

11
00:00:37,710 --> 00:00:39,150
Miss me

12
00:00:39,670 --> 00:00:40,960
after all this time apart?

13
00:00:42,350 --> 00:00:44,430
But why did you stop
searching for me lately?

14
00:00:44,920 --> 00:00:46,350
You keep blowing hot and cold,

15
00:00:46,670 --> 00:00:49,000
and it's driving me crazy.

16
00:00:49,600 --> 00:00:51,150
Then I found out

17
00:00:51,790 --> 00:00:54,240
you married that wretched Zhou Furong!

18
00:01:05,640 --> 00:01:07,590
You really miss me,

19
00:01:07,920 --> 00:01:09,790
bringing me to your wedding chamber.

20
00:01:09,790 --> 00:01:10,400
Shut up.

21
00:01:14,790 --> 00:01:16,760
Your wedding bed is quite comfortable.

22
00:01:18,920 --> 00:01:20,000
One more word,

23
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:21,280
and I won't be polite.

24
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:23,000
Shen Xingyan,

25
00:01:23,200 --> 00:01:24,640
is something wrong?

26
00:01:25,070 --> 00:01:26,000
Leave!

27
00:01:33,590 --> 00:01:34,590
This is my room.

28
00:01:34,590 --> 00:01:35,790
Why should I leave?

29
00:01:36,200 --> 00:01:36,950
Su Yunqing,

30
00:01:36,950 --> 00:01:38,200
you can't see her yet.

31
00:01:38,200 --> 00:01:39,760
Right now, you're Zhou Furong.

32
00:01:39,760 --> 00:01:41,230
Su Zhaohua won't let you off easily.

33
00:01:41,430 --> 00:01:42,400
Shen Xingyan,

34
00:01:42,710 --> 00:01:43,870
if you want a concubine,

35
00:01:43,870 --> 00:01:45,400
I've no right to interfere.

36
00:01:45,590 --> 00:01:47,280
But we share this wedding chamber.

37
00:01:47,590 --> 00:01:49,480
This is beyond disrespectful!

38
00:01:57,150 --> 00:01:59,000
Shen Xingyan, let go!

39
00:01:59,430 --> 00:02:01,040
Are you hiding someone in there?

40
00:02:01,200 --> 00:02:02,150
Too afraid to take responsibility?

41
00:02:02,150 --> 00:02:02,950
You're such a creep!

42
00:02:02,950 --> 00:02:03,790
Su Yunqing,

43
00:02:04,070 --> 00:02:05,200
trust me.

44
00:02:05,230 --> 00:02:06,790
Give me some time to handle this.

45
00:02:07,430 --> 00:02:08,310
You can't

46
00:02:08,310 --> 00:02:09,360
meet her yet.

47
00:02:17,150 --> 00:02:18,430
We sent Su Zhaohua away

48
00:02:18,750 --> 00:02:20,150
and will tighten security here.

49
00:02:20,560 --> 00:02:21,430
She won't return

50
00:02:21,430 --> 00:02:22,560
to bother you or your wife.

51
00:02:22,710 --> 00:02:23,840
I should've guessed

52
00:02:24,310 --> 00:02:25,280
that Su Zhaohua would slink back

53
00:02:25,280 --> 00:02:26,400
to take over her family's business.

54
00:02:26,870 --> 00:02:28,800
She's been holed up
at home for months,

55
00:02:28,800 --> 00:02:29,910
never once stepping out.

56
00:02:30,430 --> 00:02:32,400
No wonder
I couldn't track her down.

57
00:02:32,750 --> 00:02:33,910
The safest place

58
00:02:34,680 --> 00:02:35,910
is right under your nose.

59
00:02:36,590 --> 00:02:37,280
But

60
00:02:37,360 --> 00:02:38,710
the timing of her takeover

61
00:02:38,910 --> 00:02:40,080
coincides with Su Yunqing

62
00:02:40,080 --> 00:02:41,470
entering your family's workshop.

63
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:43,400
That's no mere coincidence.

64
00:02:43,910 --> 00:02:44,710
Do you think

65
00:02:44,800 --> 00:02:45,750
her disappearance

66
00:02:45,750 --> 00:02:47,680
was a show for Su Yunqing?

67
00:02:49,960 --> 00:02:50,910
Su Zhaohua

68
00:02:51,120 --> 00:02:52,360
has no principles,

69
00:02:52,910 --> 00:02:53,910
while Su Yunqing

70
00:02:54,430 --> 00:02:56,190
values loyalty above all.

71
00:02:56,630 --> 00:02:57,710
The Su family

72
00:02:57,840 --> 00:02:59,000
deals in medicinal herbs.

73
00:02:59,360 --> 00:03:00,630
Generations of reputation

74
00:03:00,960 --> 00:03:02,470
were built on virtue.

75
00:03:02,840 --> 00:03:03,750
Mr. Su

76
00:03:03,960 --> 00:03:06,000
knows his daughters' true natures.

77
00:03:06,360 --> 00:03:08,240
If Su Yunqing were still alive,

78
00:03:08,560 --> 00:03:09,400
Su Zhaohua would never

79
00:03:09,400 --> 00:03:11,280
have been put in charge.

80
00:03:11,430 --> 00:03:12,800
I see now.

81
00:03:13,840 --> 00:03:15,280
Su Yunqing probably still believes

82
00:03:15,630 --> 00:03:17,470
her sister is kind.

83
00:03:17,910 --> 00:03:20,000
If she learns the sister she yearns for

84
00:03:20,400 --> 00:03:22,000
is the one who betrayed her,

85
00:03:23,800 --> 00:03:24,400
I fear

86
00:03:25,310 --> 00:03:26,630
it would destroy her.

87
00:03:27,240 --> 00:03:28,240
But the truth

88
00:03:28,800 --> 00:03:30,240
won't stay hidden forever.

89
00:03:30,400 --> 00:03:32,150
We'll conceal it as long as we can.

90
00:03:35,560 --> 00:03:37,840
He was never one to chase skirts.

91
00:03:38,470 --> 00:03:40,190
Then who could it be

92
00:03:40,190 --> 00:03:41,680
that he was hiding so desperately?

93
00:03:44,430 --> 00:03:45,470
My sister.

94
00:03:49,870 --> 00:03:50,800
Lu Ziming!

95
00:03:53,430 --> 00:03:54,150
Come here.

96
00:04:00,080 --> 00:04:01,120
Have you been

97
00:04:01,120 --> 00:04:03,310
investigating my sister's whereabouts?

98
00:04:03,910 --> 00:04:05,120
Your sister?

99
00:04:05,360 --> 00:04:07,710
Mrs. Shen, stop joking.

100
00:04:07,840 --> 00:04:09,310
You're the Zhou family's only daughter.

101
00:04:09,430 --> 00:04:10,750
You don't have a sister.

102
00:04:11,280 --> 00:04:13,400
My husband trusts you the most.

103
00:04:13,560 --> 00:04:15,190
You know who I really am.

104
00:04:15,520 --> 00:04:16,560
Drop the act.

105
00:04:16,750 --> 00:04:17,920
Just tell me the truth.

106
00:04:19,750 --> 00:04:22,040
Am I truly his most trusted?

107
00:04:22,430 --> 00:04:23,240
That's great!

108
00:04:23,240 --> 00:04:24,120
Mrs. Shen,

109
00:04:24,120 --> 00:04:25,310
you should get some rest.

110
00:04:25,600 --> 00:04:26,310
I'll take my leave.

111
00:04:26,480 --> 00:04:27,310
Stop!

112
00:04:35,720 --> 00:04:36,390
Never mind.

113
00:04:36,830 --> 00:04:39,120
You'd never betray him.

114
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:41,040
Then just tell me,

115
00:04:41,040 --> 00:04:42,920
why did Su Zhaohua come today?

116
00:04:43,240 --> 00:04:44,430
Surely that's harmless?

117
00:04:44,560 --> 00:04:45,310
I truly don't know

118
00:04:45,360 --> 00:04:46,800
what passed between him and Ms. Su.

119
00:04:47,560 --> 00:04:48,750
Ms. Su?

120
00:04:50,190 --> 00:04:50,560
Alright.

121
00:04:50,750 --> 00:04:51,270
You may leave.

122
00:04:55,480 --> 00:04:56,430
Where is my sister?

123
00:04:57,360 --> 00:04:58,310
Haven't found her.

124
00:04:58,680 --> 00:04:59,920
Are you sure?

125
00:05:01,830 --> 00:05:02,920
Stop lying!

126
00:05:03,600 --> 00:05:05,360
She was in your bed that day!

127
00:05:05,360 --> 00:05:07,270
She must've tried to cry out,

128
00:05:07,360 --> 00:05:09,160
and you silenced her

129
00:05:09,240 --> 00:05:10,560
like you did to me last time!

130
00:05:11,040 --> 00:05:12,000
Shen Xingyan,

131
00:05:12,270 --> 00:05:13,800
you've gone too far!

132
00:05:18,750 --> 00:05:21,750
I have countless ways to silence others.

133
00:05:24,240 --> 00:05:25,480
But only with you

134
00:05:26,190 --> 00:05:27,560
did I ever resort to that.

135
00:05:41,040 --> 00:05:43,190
Mr. Shen will be mine someday.

136
00:05:49,950 --> 00:05:51,480
I know you still distrust me.

137
00:05:51,920 --> 00:05:53,720
My hatred for her is real.

138
00:05:53,720 --> 00:05:55,480
But so is the fact that I saved her.

139
00:05:58,630 --> 00:05:59,630
She's your sister,

140
00:06:00,950 --> 00:06:01,750
so there's much

141
00:06:01,750 --> 00:06:03,070
I can't reveal.

142
00:06:03,950 --> 00:06:05,390
But I beg you to trust me.

143
00:06:06,750 --> 00:06:08,160
Stop pressing for answers.

144
00:06:09,270 --> 00:06:10,680
But the reason I'm here

145
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:12,600
is to find my sister

146
00:06:13,190 --> 00:06:14,870
and demand justice for her.

147
00:06:15,680 --> 00:06:17,830
I don't understand
why you won't tell me.

148
00:06:18,120 --> 00:06:19,120
If I revealed

149
00:06:19,240 --> 00:06:20,240
what she's done,

150
00:06:20,750 --> 00:06:21,920
could you bear it?

151
00:06:23,600 --> 00:06:24,600
What has she done?

152
00:06:25,120 --> 00:06:26,390
Don't sow discord between us.

153
00:06:26,480 --> 00:06:28,000
My sister would never harm me.

154
00:06:29,040 --> 00:06:30,120
Su Zhaohua

155
00:06:30,430 --> 00:06:32,310
is nothing like you imagine.

156
00:06:47,800 --> 00:06:48,630
Qiuyue,

157
00:06:49,430 --> 00:06:52,190
do you think emotions can be faked?

158
00:06:53,430 --> 00:06:54,870
I heard you once had a friend

159
00:06:54,870 --> 00:06:56,190
in the workshop.

160
00:06:56,480 --> 00:06:57,950
What did she mean to you?

161
00:06:58,390 --> 00:06:59,430
Mrs. Shen,

162
00:06:59,950 --> 00:07:01,560
at the workshop,

163
00:07:01,560 --> 00:07:02,870
everyone shunned me.

164
00:07:03,560 --> 00:07:04,480
I had no friends.

165
00:07:05,240 --> 00:07:06,390
What?

166
00:07:07,040 --> 00:07:08,390
Not even one?

167
00:07:10,800 --> 00:07:11,950
No.

168
00:07:17,120 --> 00:07:17,680
Forget it.

169
00:07:17,680 --> 00:07:18,630
I don't feel like drinking.

170
00:07:20,720 --> 00:07:21,830
Mrs. Shen, please forgive me!

171
00:07:22,040 --> 00:07:23,720
Being an outcast was my fault.

172
00:07:23,720 --> 00:07:25,430
Having no friends was my fault, too.

173
00:07:25,430 --> 00:07:27,270
Please don't be angry!

174
00:07:27,950 --> 00:07:29,270
I'm not angry.

175
00:07:30,190 --> 00:07:31,310
I just thought

176
00:07:32,920 --> 00:07:35,040
someone must've
truly cared for you once.

177
00:07:49,310 --> 00:07:50,680
Mr. Shen, help!

178
00:07:50,680 --> 00:07:51,560
Mr. Shen!

179
00:07:51,750 --> 00:07:52,720
Mr. Shen!

180
00:07:53,920 --> 00:07:55,360
I just broke a teacup,

181
00:07:55,360 --> 00:07:57,240
and Mrs. Shen flew into a rage!

182
00:07:57,310 --> 00:07:59,560
I didn't mean to, Mr. Shen!

183
00:08:00,480 --> 00:08:01,480
Mr. Shen,

184
00:08:01,630 --> 00:08:03,800
please make her stop beating me.

185
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:06,390
Mr. Shen, I'm sorry.

186
00:08:06,390 --> 00:08:08,430
I didn't mean to, I swear.

187
00:08:08,680 --> 00:08:10,600
Mr. Shen, it won't happen again.

188
00:08:11,120 --> 00:08:12,720
Mr. Shen, please.

189
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:14,240
I'm sorry.

190
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:17,000
Say that again.

191
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:19,120
I said

192
00:08:19,430 --> 00:08:21,630
you should seduce Qiuyue.

193
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:28,430
What kind of man do you take me for?

194
00:08:28,870 --> 00:08:30,600
Some cheap gigolo?

195
00:08:33,750 --> 00:08:35,750
You've seen how Qiuyue's changed.

196
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:38,240
You're her target,

197
00:08:38,390 --> 00:08:40,960
and that makes you the perfect bait.

198
00:08:41,910 --> 00:08:44,000
I need to know if she's truly changed

199
00:08:44,360 --> 00:08:46,120
or is acting on First Madam's orders.

200
00:08:46,480 --> 00:08:48,240
If not for you,

201
00:08:48,270 --> 00:08:50,030
I'd have kicked her out long ago.

202
00:08:50,270 --> 00:08:51,600
Why bother with this charade?

203
00:08:52,360 --> 00:08:54,080
She's my dearest friend.

204
00:08:54,360 --> 00:08:56,120
I can't bear to see her bullied.

205
00:08:58,790 --> 00:08:59,750
Kindness

206
00:08:59,910 --> 00:09:01,480
is your greatest weakness.

207
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:04,870
I know I shouldn't harm anyone

208
00:09:04,870 --> 00:09:06,480
but keep my guard up.

209
00:09:07,550 --> 00:09:09,320
She hasn't hurt me yet,

210
00:09:09,320 --> 00:09:10,080
has she?

211
00:09:10,120 --> 00:09:11,720
"Yet" being the word.

212
00:09:13,320 --> 00:09:14,480
Aren't you afraid

213
00:09:15,120 --> 00:09:16,670
I might take the role too seriously?

214
00:09:19,550 --> 00:09:20,510
Would you?

215
00:09:48,200 --> 00:09:49,200
Mrs. Shen.

216
00:09:58,480 --> 00:10:00,440
Sweet and cool, 3 to 5 qian a measure.

217
00:10:01,200 --> 00:10:03,720
This relieves water retention
and internal heat agitation.

218
00:10:04,550 --> 00:10:05,390
Qiuyue,

219
00:10:05,750 --> 00:10:07,320
you can't even grasp basic herbology,

220
00:10:07,960 --> 00:10:09,600
yet you dare try poisoning me?
