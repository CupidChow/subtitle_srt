00:00:06,220 --> 00:00:10,020
[Guilty Maid]
[Episode 7]

2
00:00:10,180 --> 00:00:12,560
[Seven days ago]

3
00:00:19,160 --> 00:00:20,710
You declined
the First Prince's invitations

4
00:00:20,710 --> 00:00:21,600
time and again,

5
00:00:22,640 --> 00:00:25,160
yet now you cozy up
to the Second Prince's faction.

6
00:00:25,710 --> 00:00:27,160
Since you refuse
to appreciate his favor,

7
00:00:27,870 --> 00:00:29,710
remember in your next life

8
00:00:29,830 --> 00:00:30,870
not to pick the wrong side!

9
00:00:40,790 --> 00:00:42,000
I won't kill you.

10
00:00:42,320 --> 00:00:43,750
Go back and tell the First Prince

11
00:00:44,390 --> 00:00:45,560
I

12
00:00:45,750 --> 00:00:47,880
have never had any interest
in court intrigues.

13
00:00:48,320 --> 00:00:49,350
I sat for the imperial examination

14
00:00:49,790 --> 00:00:51,920
solely for the sake of the people.

15
00:00:52,110 --> 00:00:54,200
If forced to choose
between the First Prince

16
00:00:54,200 --> 00:00:55,320
and the Second Prince,

17
00:00:55,960 --> 00:00:57,070
I'd rather

18
00:00:57,670 --> 00:00:59,000
abandon the examination.

19
00:01:04,310 --> 00:01:05,070
Let him go.

20
00:01:09,430 --> 00:01:10,710
Allow him to deliver his message.

21
00:01:11,200 --> 00:01:12,040
That was how it was.

22
00:01:12,560 --> 00:01:13,790
Cuiqiao was assisting me.

23
00:01:14,040 --> 00:01:15,640
That shameless wretch.

24
00:01:15,950 --> 00:01:17,790
I haven't even settled accounts
with her over the amulet incident,

25
00:01:18,310 --> 00:01:19,070
and now

26
00:01:19,400 --> 00:01:21,230
she dares to seduce you?

27
00:01:21,230 --> 00:01:21,840
Mother,

28
00:01:22,150 --> 00:01:23,480
she has nothing to do with this.

29
00:01:23,480 --> 00:01:24,200
Nothing?

30
00:01:24,560 --> 00:01:25,310
Then...

31
00:01:26,560 --> 00:01:27,680
You've taken a liking to her?

32
00:01:29,680 --> 00:01:30,480
Alright.

33
00:01:31,040 --> 00:01:31,870
Fine.

34
00:01:32,430 --> 00:01:33,840
Once the imperial results
are publicized,

35
00:01:33,950 --> 00:01:34,680
the entire Shen family

36
00:01:34,680 --> 00:01:36,200
will know of your failure.

37
00:01:38,200 --> 00:01:40,430
Our days here

38
00:01:40,710 --> 00:01:42,310
will become unbearable.

39
00:01:42,920 --> 00:01:44,480
Keep your absence
from the imperial examination

40
00:01:44,710 --> 00:01:45,870
a secret.

41
00:01:46,950 --> 00:01:48,310
Since you like that girl,

42
00:01:48,400 --> 00:01:49,230
take her as a concubine.

43
00:01:49,230 --> 00:01:50,710
She'll be a luck-bringing maid.

44
00:01:50,710 --> 00:01:52,430
Let her bear a child for the Shen family

45
00:01:53,710 --> 00:01:55,350
to bring luck

46
00:01:55,560 --> 00:01:56,480
and ward off this misfortune.

47
00:01:57,350 --> 00:01:58,790
At present, the court is in chaos,

48
00:01:58,790 --> 00:01:59,590
and the political climate is unstable,

49
00:02:00,560 --> 00:02:01,230
so failing the exams

50
00:02:01,560 --> 00:02:02,950
may not be such a misfortune.

51
00:02:03,230 --> 00:02:04,310
As for a luck-bringing maid,

52
00:02:04,310 --> 00:02:04,920
that's out of the question.

53
00:02:05,230 --> 00:02:06,230
You'd ruin her life.

54
00:02:06,230 --> 00:02:07,480
I'm saving her!

55
00:02:07,950 --> 00:02:09,590
Think carefully.

56
00:02:10,870 --> 00:02:12,910
She betrayed the Third Madam.

57
00:02:13,190 --> 00:02:15,120
Even if I overlook the amulet incident,

58
00:02:15,470 --> 00:02:16,470
she's doomed.

59
00:02:16,470 --> 00:02:17,080
Mother.

60
00:02:19,360 --> 00:02:20,560
If you want to save her,

61
00:02:20,910 --> 00:02:22,430
this is the only way.

62
00:02:24,360 --> 00:02:25,360
Let me out!

63
00:02:32,470 --> 00:02:33,910
You know there's no escape.

64
00:02:34,150 --> 00:02:35,360
Have you still not figured it out

65
00:02:35,560 --> 00:02:36,800
after all these days of thinking?

66
00:02:38,120 --> 00:02:39,630
You'd better accept your fate
and marry me.

67
00:02:40,120 --> 00:02:41,630
Shen Xingyan,
you're nothing but a beast!

68
00:02:44,190 --> 00:02:46,310
You promised to tell me the truth
if I could work my way

69
00:02:46,560 --> 00:02:47,910
from the workshop to the main house.

70
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:49,120
Well, I did it.

71
00:02:49,560 --> 00:02:50,360
And what did you do?

72
00:02:50,910 --> 00:02:51,710
This was just

73
00:02:52,150 --> 00:02:54,030
your scheme to get me into your bed!

74
00:02:55,030 --> 00:02:56,360
Well, well, Shen Xingyan.

75
00:02:58,000 --> 00:02:59,280
You think it's fun to have me dance

76
00:02:59,280 --> 00:03:00,400
to your tune, don't you?

77
00:03:02,840 --> 00:03:04,000
There you go again.

78
00:03:06,630 --> 00:03:08,430
Never strike unless you're certain

79
00:03:08,430 --> 00:03:10,000
to wound your enemy.

80
00:03:10,840 --> 00:03:12,000
With such recklessness,

81
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:14,080
how do you expect to uncover the truth
in the Shen family?

82
00:03:15,680 --> 00:03:17,560
So my sister acted rashly too,

83
00:03:17,590 --> 00:03:19,190
and that was why you killed her
in a fit of anger?

84
00:03:23,800 --> 00:03:25,280
With your current abilities,

85
00:03:25,590 --> 00:03:26,910
even if I tell you,

86
00:03:27,150 --> 00:03:28,710
you'll end up losing your life.

87
00:03:29,120 --> 00:03:30,360
Everything I've done

88
00:03:30,800 --> 00:03:32,280
has been to protect you.

89
00:03:32,910 --> 00:03:34,630
Just stay quietly in the Shen family.

90
00:03:34,960 --> 00:03:36,240
Once the three-month period is up,

91
00:03:36,630 --> 00:03:38,400
I'll tell you the truth.

92
00:03:39,680 --> 00:03:40,800
I don't need your protection.

93
00:03:41,030 --> 00:03:42,750
I'd rather die than marry you!

94
00:03:43,400 --> 00:03:44,470
That's not for you to decide.

95
00:04:04,710 --> 00:04:05,750
Drink this.

96
00:04:11,030 --> 00:04:12,630
Unless you'd prefer I force it
down your throat.

97
00:04:19,360 --> 00:04:20,160
Keep an eye on her!

98
00:04:20,560 --> 00:04:21,430
Lock the door.

99
00:04:21,560 --> 00:04:22,000
Yes,

100
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:22,630
Mr. Shen.

101
00:04:29,540 --> 00:04:32,220
[Zhou Furong, Shen Xingyan's betrothed]

102
00:04:32,600 --> 00:04:33,720
I heard from my father

103
00:04:33,920 --> 00:04:36,270
that Xingyan is returning
from the capital.

104
00:04:37,190 --> 00:04:38,560
He's resting

105
00:04:38,630 --> 00:04:39,430
after the long journey.

106
00:04:39,430 --> 00:04:40,870
How is your father's health?

107
00:04:42,120 --> 00:04:43,360
My father?

108
00:04:43,360 --> 00:04:45,040
He fell ill suddenly.

109
00:04:46,070 --> 00:04:47,480
He was perfectly fine just days ago.

110
00:04:47,680 --> 00:04:49,190
How could he take ill so abruptly?

111
00:04:50,160 --> 00:04:51,750
Before I even married Xingyan,

112
00:04:52,040 --> 00:04:54,560
he's already taking in
a luck-bringing maid.

113
00:04:55,390 --> 00:04:56,560
Father fears

114
00:04:56,800 --> 00:04:58,190
that if the girl pleases him,

115
00:04:58,190 --> 00:04:59,390
he'll cast me aside.

116
00:04:59,920 --> 00:05:01,270
The shock of it

117
00:05:01,390 --> 00:05:02,630
made him ill.

118
00:05:02,830 --> 00:05:04,560
Nonsense.

119
00:05:05,040 --> 00:05:06,920
That girl is, at best,
a concubine for the night.

120
00:05:07,480 --> 00:05:09,240
You are the future mistress
of this household.

121
00:05:09,430 --> 00:05:10,390
You've known each other for years.

122
00:05:10,390 --> 00:05:11,240
What is there to fear?

123
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:14,270
How much longer must we wait?

124
00:05:14,430 --> 00:05:15,800
Why hasn't she been brought out yet?

125
00:05:18,360 --> 00:05:19,240
Greetings, Second Madam,

126
00:05:19,240 --> 00:05:20,160
Miss Zhou.

127
00:05:21,920 --> 00:05:23,950
So, you're the luck-bringing maid?

128
00:05:24,160 --> 00:05:25,560
What a wretched face.

129
00:05:25,720 --> 00:05:27,600
How could you possibly
bring anyone luck?

130
00:05:29,800 --> 00:05:30,750
I'm speaking to you!

131
00:05:30,750 --> 00:05:31,920
Are you mute?

132
00:05:32,560 --> 00:05:33,800
This is Miss Zhou,

133
00:05:33,800 --> 00:05:35,000
Mr. Shen's betrothed.

134
00:05:35,190 --> 00:05:36,240
Go on, explain yourself.

135
00:05:36,830 --> 00:05:38,310
Miss Zhou, please don't be mad.

136
00:05:38,630 --> 00:05:40,560
Cuiqiao hasn't eaten in days.

137
00:05:40,560 --> 00:05:41,830
No one asked you.

138
00:05:41,830 --> 00:05:42,630
On your knees!

139
00:05:43,360 --> 00:05:44,630
And you.

140
00:05:44,720 --> 00:05:45,720
No manners at all.

141
00:05:45,720 --> 00:05:46,800
Kneel!

142
00:05:51,160 --> 00:05:52,870
The wedding day is approaching.

143
00:05:53,120 --> 00:05:54,310
There must be no bloodshed.

144
00:05:54,830 --> 00:05:56,190
If I'm injured,

145
00:05:56,630 --> 00:05:57,800
the luck-bringing ritual

146
00:05:57,870 --> 00:05:59,390
can at least be delayed.

147
00:05:59,480 --> 00:06:01,680
We've always stood before Second Madam.

148
00:06:01,830 --> 00:06:03,950
If we knelt without her command,

149
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:05,390
that would truly be against manners.

150
00:06:05,870 --> 00:06:07,070
Does the Zhou family

151
00:06:07,800 --> 00:06:09,310
place the young mistress

152
00:06:09,750 --> 00:06:11,160
above the Madam?

153
00:06:13,120 --> 00:06:14,560
Don't you dare sow discord!

154
00:06:15,310 --> 00:06:16,560
On your knees!

155
00:06:20,630 --> 00:06:21,430
Xingyan!

156
00:06:27,830 --> 00:06:28,800
Are you hurt?

157
00:06:44,830 --> 00:06:45,800
Since when

158
00:06:46,830 --> 00:06:48,160
do outsiders

159
00:06:48,800 --> 00:06:50,920
dare raise a hand in the Shen family?

160
00:06:52,800 --> 00:06:54,120
How am I an outsider?

161
00:06:54,240 --> 00:06:55,830
We're betrothed.

162
00:06:55,830 --> 00:06:57,190
I'm the future mistress,

163
00:06:57,190 --> 00:06:58,160
your wife.

164
00:06:59,240 --> 00:07:01,800
My wife would never bully the weak

165
00:07:01,800 --> 00:07:03,360
or harm others without cause!

166
00:07:03,800 --> 00:07:04,600
I'll speak

167
00:07:05,120 --> 00:07:07,430
to Master Zhou myself

168
00:07:07,950 --> 00:07:09,240
and cancel this engagement.

169
00:07:09,240 --> 00:07:10,040
What?

170
00:07:10,360 --> 00:07:11,160
Cancle the engagement?

171
00:07:11,680 --> 00:07:13,270
This marriage was arranged
between two families!

172
00:07:13,310 --> 00:07:14,920
You can't just call it off!

173
00:07:15,750 --> 00:07:16,750
And Furong,

174
00:07:17,160 --> 00:07:19,430
why stoop to quarreling with a maid?

175
00:07:19,630 --> 00:07:20,480
Apologize now.

176
00:07:20,480 --> 00:07:21,750
She harmed my people.

177
00:07:22,390 --> 00:07:23,160
This

178
00:07:23,720 --> 00:07:25,040
won't be settled

179
00:07:25,240 --> 00:07:26,750
with mere apologies.

180
00:07:28,360 --> 00:07:28,950
Shumeng.

181
00:07:29,360 --> 00:07:30,160
Escort her out.

182
00:07:30,560 --> 00:07:31,070
Yes.

183
00:07:33,800 --> 00:07:35,600
[Shen Mansion]

184
00:07:44,310 --> 00:07:45,560
You're finally awake.

185
00:07:45,800 --> 00:07:46,720
Have some congee.

186
00:07:46,750 --> 00:07:48,720
The physician said
you fainted from hunger.

187
00:07:50,190 --> 00:07:51,310
Just leave it.

188
00:07:51,310 --> 00:07:52,600
I'll eat later.

189
00:07:53,390 --> 00:07:55,040
Mr. Shen gave strict orders

190
00:07:55,040 --> 00:07:56,360
before leaving for the Zhou mansion.

191
00:07:56,560 --> 00:07:58,720
If you haven't eaten by his return,

192
00:07:58,720 --> 00:07:59,800
I'll be punished.

193
00:08:00,070 --> 00:08:00,750
Cuiqiao,

194
00:08:01,040 --> 00:08:02,190
please, just a bite.

195
00:08:02,190 --> 00:08:03,160
I beg you.

196
00:08:10,870 --> 00:08:12,160
Mr. Shen went to the Zhou mansion?

197
00:08:12,270 --> 00:08:13,560
While you were unconscious,

198
00:08:13,630 --> 00:08:15,360
he confronted Zhou Furong
about canceling the engagement.

199
00:08:15,630 --> 00:08:18,040
At first I thought
it was just anger talking.

200
00:08:18,070 --> 00:08:19,430
But if he succeeds,

201
00:08:19,870 --> 00:08:21,950
you might escape this calamity.

202
00:08:22,630 --> 00:08:23,870
Why do you say that?

203
00:08:26,720 --> 00:08:29,360
When Mr. Shen was to marry
Miss Su of the Su family,

204
00:08:29,390 --> 00:08:31,160
she vanished on their wedding day.

205
00:08:31,390 --> 00:08:32,150
Rumors say

206
00:08:32,390 --> 00:08:34,320
Zhou Furong had her killed.

207
00:08:34,630 --> 00:08:36,270
For someone of your standing,

208
00:08:37,030 --> 00:08:38,870
she'd never let you marry him.

209
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:40,000
Miss Su?

210
00:08:40,080 --> 00:08:41,270
You mean Su Zhaohua?

211
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:43,790
I don't recall.

212
00:08:44,030 --> 00:08:45,870
Only that she was a daughter
of the Su family.

213
00:08:47,150 --> 00:08:47,910
So my sister

214
00:08:48,320 --> 00:08:50,600
was murdered by Zhou Furong.

215
00:08:50,670 --> 00:08:51,750
Don't worry.

216
00:08:51,790 --> 00:08:53,440
Mr. Shen defended you so fiercely today.

217
00:08:53,480 --> 00:08:54,670
You'll be safe.

218
00:08:55,790 --> 00:08:57,270
With your current abilities,

219
00:08:57,630 --> 00:08:58,960
even if I tell you,

220
00:08:59,320 --> 00:09:00,630
you'll end up losing your life.

221
00:09:01,840 --> 00:09:02,480
Indeed.

222
00:09:03,390 --> 00:09:06,270
Even with his covert protection,
every step here

223
00:09:06,480 --> 00:09:07,840
is perilous.

224
00:09:08,390 --> 00:09:10,700
If I rashly confront Zhou Furong
at the Zhou mansion,

225
00:09:11,390 --> 00:09:13,060
it would be a disaster.

226
00:09:19,060 --> 00:09:20,350
I'll live well

227
00:09:21,300 --> 00:09:22,940
and marry Mr. Shen in grand style.

228
00:09:24,940 --> 00:09:25,870
Only then

229
00:09:26,300 --> 00:09:28,940
will Zhou Furong be driven
to reckless fury, exposing her crimes

230
00:09:29,470 --> 00:09:31,350
so I can avenge my sister.

231
00:09:47,110 --> 00:09:49,780
This is the bridal chamber
they prepared?

232
00:09:50,180 --> 00:09:52,150
How stingy of the Shen family.

233
00:09:52,300 --> 00:09:53,180
Couldn't they arrange

234
00:09:53,180 --> 00:09:54,510
something better?

235
00:09:56,020 --> 00:09:57,150
Ms. Yang,

236
00:09:57,510 --> 00:09:58,900
even our puppy

237
00:09:58,900 --> 00:10:00,350
live better than this, right?

238
00:10:01,110 --> 00:10:02,060
Miss,

239
00:10:02,150 --> 00:10:03,630
you're being blunt again.

240
00:10:04,060 --> 00:10:04,990
Look,

241
00:10:04,990 --> 00:10:07,300
Cuiqiao is standing right there.

242
00:10:10,750 --> 00:10:12,110
Oh, Cuiqiao,

243
00:10:12,300 --> 00:10:13,230
I'm sorry.

244
00:10:13,230 --> 00:10:14,420
I didn't see you there.

245
00:10:15,020 --> 00:10:16,510
Last night,

246
00:10:16,510 --> 00:10:18,470
Second Madam asked me to assist

247
00:10:18,470 --> 00:10:19,630
with the concubine-taking arrangements.

248
00:10:20,180 --> 00:10:21,020
As the principal wife,

249
00:10:21,020 --> 00:10:22,300
I admit I overstepped.

250
00:10:22,990 --> 00:10:24,420
So today

251
00:10:24,470 --> 00:10:25,700
I've brought you dowry

252
00:10:25,750 --> 00:10:26,900
to make amends.

253
00:10:37,150 --> 00:10:38,350
Such lavish items

254
00:10:38,750 --> 00:10:40,750
should belong to a principal wife.

255
00:10:41,420 --> 00:10:42,900
Is this meant to humiliate me,

256
00:10:43,510 --> 00:10:44,870
or to frame me

257
00:10:44,870 --> 00:10:46,150
before the Shen family?

258
00:10:46,540 --> 00:10:47,270
Cuiqiao,

259
00:10:47,510 --> 00:10:48,700
and this too.

260
00:10:50,270 --> 00:10:51,180
Look.

261
00:10:51,180 --> 00:10:52,900
Premium pollen.

262
00:10:52,900 --> 00:10:54,150
Exceptionally fragrant.

263
00:10:54,900 --> 00:10:55,900
Too bad

264
00:10:56,300 --> 00:10:57,940
I'm deathly allergic to it.

265
00:10:58,470 --> 00:11:01,230
The kind that kills.

266
00:11:02,350 --> 00:11:05,020
Otherwise I'd never part with it.

267
00:11:05,510 --> 00:11:06,300
Help!

268
00:11:06,300 --> 00:11:07,390
Someone!

269
00:11:07,390 --> 00:11:09,630
Miss Zhou is collapsing!
