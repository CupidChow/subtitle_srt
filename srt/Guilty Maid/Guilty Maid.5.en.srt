00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:10,080
[Guilty Maid]
[Episode 5]

2
00:00:13,960 --> 00:00:15,960
Do you still remember
our three-month pact?

3
00:00:16,920 --> 00:00:18,000
Do you still remember?

4
00:00:19,070 --> 00:00:19,800
Mr. Shen,

5
00:00:20,440 --> 00:00:21,640
did you hear that?

6
00:00:21,830 --> 00:00:22,760
So Wei Xian

7
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:24,440
is truly your lover?

8
00:00:24,670 --> 00:00:25,480
Yes.

9
00:00:26,350 --> 00:00:27,480
The Fourth Madam

10
00:00:27,480 --> 00:00:28,960
threatened me with my account books.

11
00:00:29,230 --> 00:00:30,830
I finally found an opportunity

12
00:00:30,830 --> 00:00:32,000
to bring her down.

13
00:00:32,150 --> 00:00:33,030
Why must you

14
00:00:33,350 --> 00:00:35,560
ruin your own reputation to shield her?

15
00:00:35,840 --> 00:00:37,240
She is innocent.

16
00:00:37,560 --> 00:00:38,560
I'm not shielding her.

17
00:00:39,070 --> 00:00:41,150
You're still denying it?

18
00:00:42,240 --> 00:00:44,560
The Fourth Madam
has already exposed my secret ledgers

19
00:00:44,640 --> 00:00:45,750
to the First Madam.

20
00:00:46,200 --> 00:00:47,640
If she pursues this,

21
00:00:47,670 --> 00:00:50,070
years of my efforts will be wasted.

22
00:00:50,070 --> 00:00:52,110
And it's all thanks to you!

23
00:00:55,030 --> 00:00:56,000
Quietly throw her

24
00:00:56,430 --> 00:00:58,470
into the well
in the Fourth Madam's courtyard.

25
00:00:59,840 --> 00:01:01,030
Don't let her sully the feng shui here.

26
00:01:01,070 --> 00:01:01,790
Understood.

27
00:01:01,840 --> 00:01:03,110
I can't die yet.

28
00:01:03,430 --> 00:01:04,870
I haven't found my sister.

29
00:01:05,400 --> 00:01:06,870
If you want to survive,

30
00:01:07,200 --> 00:01:08,920
you'll have to learn patience.

31
00:01:10,230 --> 00:01:11,950
I'd rather not return

32
00:01:12,480 --> 00:01:14,680
to find you in the mass graves.

33
00:01:18,590 --> 00:01:19,350
No.

34
00:01:19,350 --> 00:01:20,200
No, please!

35
00:01:20,200 --> 00:01:21,590
Third Madam!

36
00:01:21,870 --> 00:01:23,040
Third Madam, have mercy!

37
00:01:23,230 --> 00:01:24,590
The matter of the falsified accounts
can be a big deal or a minor one.

38
00:01:25,120 --> 00:01:26,950
If I can help you
get through this crisis,

39
00:01:27,280 --> 00:01:29,070
will you spare my life?

40
00:01:31,400 --> 00:01:32,350
Falsifying ledgers

41
00:01:32,350 --> 00:01:33,230
is no trivial offense.

42
00:01:33,280 --> 00:01:34,760
We might as well hear her out.

43
00:01:37,710 --> 00:01:38,760
Spare you?

44
00:01:39,590 --> 00:01:41,400
Why should I trust you again?

45
00:01:42,640 --> 00:01:43,560
I have a plan.

46
00:01:44,350 --> 00:01:45,430
Please hear me out.

47
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:48,790
Speak.

48
00:01:57,280 --> 00:01:58,310
It could work.

49
00:01:59,590 --> 00:02:00,790
But I don't trust you.

50
00:02:01,480 --> 00:02:02,120
Cuiqiao,

51
00:02:02,430 --> 00:02:03,070
keep an eye on her.

52
00:02:03,710 --> 00:02:04,310
Yes.

53
00:02:08,800 --> 00:02:09,960
Mount Wudang's Fuzhen Temple

54
00:02:09,960 --> 00:02:11,120
is a sacred place for scholars.

55
00:02:11,470 --> 00:02:13,190
Each Chinese New Year,

56
00:02:13,400 --> 00:02:14,470
only the first ten devotees

57
00:02:14,470 --> 00:02:15,710
who offer incense may receive

58
00:02:15,710 --> 00:02:16,680
the Taoist master's blessed amulet.

59
00:02:17,430 --> 00:02:19,080
Some have offered
a thousand liang of gold,

60
00:02:19,150 --> 00:02:20,430
yet failed to obtain
such divine blessings.

61
00:02:21,190 --> 00:02:22,030
This amulet

62
00:02:22,030 --> 00:02:22,960
cannot be acquired on a whim.

63
00:02:23,430 --> 00:02:25,400
Third Madam could have someone
purchase a common talisman.

64
00:02:25,470 --> 00:02:26,870
I can craft a convincing replica.

65
00:02:27,400 --> 00:02:28,190
Liuli.

66
00:02:32,280 --> 00:02:33,680
This concerns Mr. Shen's future.

67
00:02:34,080 --> 00:02:36,400
No one would dare tear open the amulet
to verify its authenticity.

68
00:02:36,680 --> 00:02:38,870
Thus, the plan is foolproof.

69
00:02:41,560 --> 00:02:42,240
Third Madam,

70
00:02:42,680 --> 00:02:43,910
[Shen Mansion]
what do you have to say?

71
00:02:43,910 --> 00:02:44,710
First Madam,

72
00:02:45,150 --> 00:02:46,960
I did falsify the accounts.

73
00:02:47,240 --> 00:02:48,280
But some transactions

74
00:02:48,280 --> 00:02:49,680
simply cannot be recorded openly.

75
00:02:50,120 --> 00:02:50,870
Well, well.

76
00:02:50,870 --> 00:02:51,710
[First Madam of the Shen family]

77
00:02:51,710 --> 00:02:52,960
Abusing your position

78
00:02:52,960 --> 00:02:54,030
to embezzle family funds

79
00:02:54,030 --> 00:02:55,560
and you still dare to justify yourself?

80
00:02:56,080 --> 00:02:56,910
Ms. Liu.

81
00:02:57,470 --> 00:02:58,350
[Ms. Liu, First Madam's Head Servant]
Mete out the family's punishment.

82
00:02:58,840 --> 00:02:59,960
First Madam, do not be hasty.

83
00:03:02,240 --> 00:03:03,190
Look.

84
00:03:03,710 --> 00:03:04,750
Divine blessings are beyond price.

85
00:03:04,800 --> 00:03:05,960
The more one sacrifices,

86
00:03:05,960 --> 00:03:07,190
the more one gains.

87
00:03:08,190 --> 00:03:09,960
This is an amulet

88
00:03:09,960 --> 00:03:10,870
I secured for Mr. Shen

89
00:03:11,310 --> 00:03:12,840
to ensure his smooth career advancement.

90
00:03:13,710 --> 00:03:16,030
You spent so much on an amulet?

91
00:03:16,470 --> 00:03:18,710
If it truly came from Mount Wudang,

92
00:03:18,960 --> 00:03:20,710
no amount of money would be excessive.

93
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:22,190
Divine blessings are beyond price.

94
00:03:23,430 --> 00:03:24,360
What worries me

95
00:03:25,120 --> 00:03:27,080
is that someone might deceive us
with a fake.

96
00:03:27,630 --> 00:03:28,430
A fake?

97
00:03:29,750 --> 00:03:32,430
This was consecrated
by Mount Wudang's Taoist master himself.

98
00:03:33,910 --> 00:03:34,680
Second Madam,

99
00:03:34,960 --> 00:03:36,750
if you doubt its authenticity,

100
00:03:36,750 --> 00:03:38,630
you may open it and check.

101
00:03:38,870 --> 00:03:40,400
But let me warn you,

102
00:03:40,560 --> 00:03:41,630
once opened,

103
00:03:41,840 --> 00:03:43,910
Mr. Shen's career
will suffer dire consequences.

104
00:03:44,470 --> 00:03:45,240
First Madam,

105
00:03:45,400 --> 00:03:46,910
if you wish to examine it,

106
00:03:47,080 --> 00:03:48,240
I will tear it open

107
00:03:48,240 --> 00:03:49,280
to prove my innocence.

108
00:03:49,430 --> 00:03:51,190
Mr. Shen's future

109
00:03:51,190 --> 00:03:52,590
outweighs all else.

110
00:03:53,120 --> 00:03:54,120
This is no trivial matter.

111
00:03:58,030 --> 00:03:59,400
You're only so bold

112
00:03:59,470 --> 00:04:01,430
because you know no one would dare

113
00:04:02,120 --> 00:04:04,150
gamble with Mr. Shen's prospects.

114
00:04:04,910 --> 00:04:06,560
What a clever move.

115
00:04:06,750 --> 00:04:07,310
Admit

116
00:04:07,630 --> 00:04:08,870
this is your forgery!

117
00:04:09,430 --> 00:04:10,190
Second Madam,

118
00:04:10,470 --> 00:04:12,870
how could I possibly
have fabricated this amulet?

119
00:04:14,510 --> 00:04:15,750
[Cuiqiao, Head maid]

120
00:04:15,750 --> 00:04:16,630
On your knees!

121
00:04:17,270 --> 00:04:18,720
Even Cuiqiao left her

122
00:04:18,750 --> 00:04:20,430
after all those years.

123
00:04:21,310 --> 00:04:22,360
You're new here.

124
00:04:22,360 --> 00:04:23,600
How dare you hide things?

125
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:25,430
Say this amulet is fake!

126
00:04:25,950 --> 00:04:27,310
The the funds she embezzled

127
00:04:27,310 --> 00:04:29,000
were never spent on this.

128
00:04:29,240 --> 00:04:30,070
Second Madam,

129
00:04:30,160 --> 00:04:31,720
Cuiqiao sacrificed Mr. Shen's future

130
00:04:31,870 --> 00:04:33,390
for her own gain.

131
00:04:33,630 --> 00:04:34,800
She's the one who should be punished.

132
00:04:35,240 --> 00:04:37,040
Still defiant, are you?

133
00:04:37,070 --> 00:04:38,160
You think I won't risk

134
00:04:38,160 --> 00:04:40,270
my son's future, don't you?

135
00:04:41,040 --> 00:04:41,720
Fine.

136
00:04:41,950 --> 00:04:42,720
Cuiqiao,

137
00:04:42,720 --> 00:04:43,630
fetch the scissors.

138
00:04:43,950 --> 00:04:44,600
Now,

139
00:04:44,830 --> 00:04:46,480
I'll cut open this amulet

140
00:04:46,480 --> 00:04:48,480
and see what's truly inside!

141
00:04:49,920 --> 00:04:51,270
I've seen consecrated ones before.

142
00:04:51,270 --> 00:04:52,600
They cannot be replicated.

143
00:04:52,680 --> 00:04:53,270
Look.

144
00:04:53,390 --> 00:04:54,190
Look!

145
00:04:54,480 --> 00:04:55,480
This is clearly...

146
00:04:55,480 --> 00:04:56,000
This is...

147
00:04:59,000 --> 00:04:59,680
It's...

148
00:05:00,270 --> 00:05:01,000
It's...

149
00:05:01,720 --> 00:05:02,800
This is clearly...

150
00:05:10,720 --> 00:05:13,160
Last time, I ruined
Cuiqiao's chance at merit.

151
00:05:13,160 --> 00:05:14,480
And she holds grudges.

152
00:05:14,630 --> 00:05:16,950
If she exposes this,
I'll be in grave trouble.

153
00:05:17,480 --> 00:05:19,040
Fortunately, my sister's sachet

154
00:05:19,040 --> 00:05:20,310
contains the very talisman
I once procured for her.

155
00:05:20,830 --> 00:05:22,040
I've kept it with me all this time.

156
00:05:22,870 --> 00:05:24,270
It was consecrated.

157
00:05:24,680 --> 00:05:26,190
They shouldn't be able to
tell the difference.

158
00:05:29,310 --> 00:05:30,000
Madam,

159
00:05:30,120 --> 00:05:32,600
it's indeed from Mount Wudang.

160
00:05:33,600 --> 00:05:36,000
They say Mount Wudang's Fuzhen Temple

161
00:05:36,240 --> 00:05:37,830
is a sacred place for scholars.

162
00:05:37,830 --> 00:05:39,120
Miraculously potent.

163
00:05:39,430 --> 00:05:41,360
Truly hard to obtain.

164
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:43,000
How can this be real?

165
00:05:43,680 --> 00:05:44,750
How can this be real?

166
00:05:46,040 --> 00:05:46,430
How...

167
00:05:46,430 --> 00:05:48,240
How could this happen?

168
00:05:49,750 --> 00:05:51,630
As Mr. Shen's mother,

169
00:05:51,720 --> 00:05:53,270
how dare you sever his divine blessings!

170
00:05:53,920 --> 00:05:55,630
You seek to ruin his career,

171
00:05:55,630 --> 00:05:57,360
to destroy the Master's plans
in the capital!

172
00:05:57,360 --> 00:05:58,190
Impossible!

173
00:05:58,560 --> 00:05:59,390
This can't be real!

174
00:05:59,560 --> 00:06:00,310
You!

175
00:06:01,070 --> 00:06:02,000
Didn't you claim

176
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:03,070
it was fake?

177
00:06:03,480 --> 00:06:04,630
You're the one who set me up!

178
00:06:05,240 --> 00:06:05,830
I...

179
00:06:11,480 --> 00:06:12,720
This is what you get for crossing me!

180
00:06:12,830 --> 00:06:14,600
Taking my money and lying to me!

181
00:06:15,680 --> 00:06:17,920
You'd better pray my son
becomes the top scholar,

182
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:19,390
or you'll pay dearly!

183
00:06:30,360 --> 00:06:31,390
I must inform Shen Xingyan

184
00:06:31,390 --> 00:06:32,310
of my situation

185
00:06:32,600 --> 00:06:34,360
and ask him to tell me
where my sister is.

186
00:06:34,630 --> 00:06:36,120
But where can I find him?

187
00:06:36,390 --> 00:06:38,120
If I speak rashly,

188
00:06:38,600 --> 00:06:39,800
will he even believe me?

189
00:06:46,680 --> 00:06:47,430
What's happening?

190
00:06:48,190 --> 00:06:49,070
This feeling

191
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:51,360
is like last time.

192
00:07:10,430 --> 00:07:11,360
This is

193
00:07:12,120 --> 00:07:13,160
the woodshed?

194
00:07:23,160 --> 00:07:25,070
I've become Cuiqiao this time?

195
00:07:30,560 --> 00:07:31,750
I have loads of money.

196
00:07:31,800 --> 00:07:34,680
I doubt whether you possess
anything of genuine worth.

197
00:07:35,190 --> 00:07:37,120
I've devoted my entire life

198
00:07:37,720 --> 00:07:39,190
to refining this elixir.

199
00:07:39,870 --> 00:07:42,000
Upon ingestion,
it concentrates one's vital energy

200
00:07:42,160 --> 00:07:43,240
to form a lycoris radiata sigil

201
00:07:43,560 --> 00:07:45,680
at the Yunmen acupoint.

202
00:07:46,040 --> 00:07:46,750
Will this

203
00:07:47,240 --> 00:07:49,360
truly condemn her
to a lifetime of misery?

204
00:07:49,950 --> 00:07:52,430
Whenever those she despises face peril,

205
00:07:53,120 --> 00:07:56,120
she shall assume their forms
to bear their misfortunes

206
00:07:56,390 --> 00:07:57,390
and to live eternally

207
00:07:57,750 --> 00:08:00,800
wearing the faces of her loathed ones.

208
00:08:01,680 --> 00:08:03,070
Are you satisfied?

209
00:08:13,800 --> 00:08:14,480
Su Yunqing.

210
00:08:14,750 --> 00:08:16,560
I feel like I've become someone else.

211
00:08:16,560 --> 00:08:17,240
Su Yunqing!

212
00:08:17,560 --> 00:08:18,480
Su Yunqing!

213
00:08:25,830 --> 00:08:27,800
So this is the sigil.

214
00:08:28,270 --> 00:08:31,310
She was truly cursed
with something so vile.

215
00:08:33,960 --> 00:08:35,080
You're finally awake, Mr. Shen.

216
00:08:36,750 --> 00:08:37,270
Here.

217
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:41,750
The physician said it was krait venom.

218
00:08:42,150 --> 00:08:43,080
A moment later,

219
00:08:43,080 --> 00:08:43,750
and you might have been dead.

220
00:08:44,790 --> 00:08:45,870
This is all my negligence.

221
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:48,150
Don't blame yourself.

222
00:08:49,320 --> 00:08:50,960
Who could have thought
the First Prince's men

223
00:08:50,960 --> 00:08:51,780
would resort to venom?

224
00:08:52,960 --> 00:08:54,200
How long was I unconscious?

225
00:08:54,750 --> 00:08:55,750
Five days.

226
00:08:56,440 --> 00:08:58,720
What about the investigation
into the Fourth Madam?

227
00:08:59,200 --> 00:09:01,320
I've been secretly observing.

228
00:09:02,030 --> 00:09:04,320
But she bears no resemblance
to Su Yunqing.

229
00:09:05,200 --> 00:09:05,960
However,

230
00:09:06,200 --> 00:09:08,150
when we rescued
the Fourth Madam that day,

231
00:09:08,150 --> 00:09:09,750
a maid mentioned something

232
00:09:10,200 --> 00:09:11,320
about a three-month pact.

233
00:09:13,120 --> 00:09:13,870
Where is that maid now?

234
00:09:13,870 --> 00:09:14,630
Mr. Shen,

235
00:09:14,670 --> 00:09:15,600
easy there.

236
00:09:17,240 --> 00:09:18,240
It was the one

237
00:09:18,240 --> 00:09:19,790
who exposed Wei Xian's identity.

238
00:09:20,030 --> 00:09:22,000
But the Third Madam
took her away afterward.

239
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:24,080
Get her back now.

240
00:09:24,960 --> 00:09:25,750
Understood.

241
00:09:27,960 --> 00:09:28,870
Su Yunqing,

242
00:09:29,240 --> 00:09:30,870
no matter what you become,

243
00:09:31,200 --> 00:09:32,720
I'll always find you.

244
00:09:33,480 --> 00:09:34,390
Wait for me.

245
00:09:35,790 --> 00:09:37,320
You'll remain here

246
00:09:37,550 --> 00:09:39,200
until the imperial results
are announced.

247
00:09:39,240 --> 00:09:41,030
If my son fails to place first,

248
00:09:41,240 --> 00:09:42,960
you'll suffer dearly.

249
00:09:50,550 --> 00:09:52,270
But he never sat
for the imperial examination.

250
00:09:52,550 --> 00:09:53,720
How could he possibly place first?

251
00:09:54,440 --> 00:09:55,670
What should I do?
