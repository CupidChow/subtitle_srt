00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:10,080
[Guilty Maid]
[Episode 19]

2
00:00:10,400 --> 00:00:12,270
Rather than living under others' roof,

3
00:00:12,560 --> 00:00:13,960
at their mercy,

4
00:00:14,110 --> 00:00:14,880
why not

5
00:00:14,880 --> 00:00:17,390
stand tall as your true self?

6
00:00:18,510 --> 00:00:19,760
So you already know?

7
00:00:22,280 --> 00:00:23,800
You also know
about the secret accounts?

8
00:00:28,760 --> 00:00:30,070
That secret account book was planted

9
00:00:30,070 --> 00:00:31,440
in the Second Madam's place
on my orders.

10
00:00:31,440 --> 00:00:32,670
How could I not know?

11
00:00:35,350 --> 00:00:37,560
I thought she discovered my identity.

12
00:00:37,560 --> 00:00:38,560
Yet

13
00:00:38,560 --> 00:00:39,520
no matter how many times

14
00:00:39,520 --> 00:00:41,600
I've studied that secret account book,

15
00:00:41,670 --> 00:00:44,280
it remains beyond my grasp.

16
00:00:45,240 --> 00:00:47,280
Xingyan is currently

17
00:00:47,280 --> 00:00:48,430
overwhelmed by this matter.

18
00:00:48,840 --> 00:00:50,710
I think your brilliance

19
00:00:50,710 --> 00:00:52,110
could ease his burden.

20
00:00:52,430 --> 00:00:53,390
This could also

21
00:00:53,390 --> 00:00:55,880
bring you closer to him.

22
00:00:55,960 --> 00:00:56,790
Once

23
00:00:56,790 --> 00:01:00,560
the three-year mourning period ends,
you'll be his principal wife.

24
00:01:02,320 --> 00:01:03,520
If I investigate the accounts,

25
00:01:03,790 --> 00:01:05,950
I might uncover more about my sister.

26
00:01:13,870 --> 00:01:14,790
These account books

27
00:01:15,350 --> 00:01:16,790
can't be checked in such a short time.

28
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:18,790
Xingyan, this is of great importance.

29
00:01:18,790 --> 00:01:20,280
There's no time to waste.

30
00:01:23,840 --> 00:01:24,870
I can help.

31
00:01:28,590 --> 00:01:29,150
Out.

32
00:01:30,510 --> 00:01:31,840
With so many account books,

33
00:01:32,560 --> 00:01:34,560
how long will it take you
to do it alone?

34
00:01:35,350 --> 00:01:36,680
How could a workshop girl like you

35
00:01:37,310 --> 00:01:38,350
know how to check accounts?

36
00:01:39,310 --> 00:01:41,590
We'll know if I can do it once I try.

37
00:01:49,230 --> 00:01:50,040
Qingqiu,

38
00:01:50,710 --> 00:01:52,640
if you fear the account books
implicating the entire Shen family

39
00:01:52,640 --> 00:01:53,840
when handed to the authorities,

40
00:01:54,400 --> 00:01:55,000
then I'll just

41
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:56,350
silence those women.

42
00:01:56,350 --> 00:01:57,510
Why go to such great lengths

43
00:01:57,510 --> 00:01:58,590
to win over Qiuyue

44
00:01:58,590 --> 00:01:59,840
to help Shen Xingyan check the accounts?

45
00:02:00,230 --> 00:02:01,350
Especially when you're carrying...

46
00:02:03,560 --> 00:02:05,040
We're running out of time.

47
00:02:06,230 --> 00:02:08,400
You've already taken a life.

48
00:02:08,400 --> 00:02:09,120
How can I

49
00:02:09,120 --> 00:02:10,840
let you risk your life again?

50
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:12,870
Besides,

51
00:02:13,030 --> 00:02:13,710
vengeance

52
00:02:13,710 --> 00:02:14,840
has its proper targets.

53
00:02:15,680 --> 00:02:17,590
We can't harm the innocent.

54
00:02:18,560 --> 00:02:22,240
A maid who knows the law
and conducts an autopsy

55
00:02:22,910 --> 00:02:24,310
is no ordinary girl.

56
00:02:25,240 --> 00:02:28,430
If she can stir up trouble
within the Shen family

57
00:02:28,800 --> 00:02:30,400
and make them turn on each other,

58
00:02:31,470 --> 00:02:32,590
wouldn't that be delightful?

59
00:02:34,360 --> 00:02:35,630
Send people

60
00:02:35,630 --> 00:02:37,560
to spread the word
outside the Third Madam's doorstep.

61
00:02:37,840 --> 00:02:38,630
Say

62
00:02:38,910 --> 00:02:40,960
their secret accounts
have been discovered.

63
00:02:51,800 --> 00:02:52,630
Have you found anything?

64
00:02:52,750 --> 00:02:53,800
The gold-plated silver materials

65
00:02:53,960 --> 00:02:55,870
are valued at 74,000 taels of gold.

66
00:02:56,800 --> 00:02:58,190
I've cross-checked

67
00:02:58,190 --> 00:02:59,520
all the suppliers' account books,

68
00:03:00,710 --> 00:03:02,000
but I still can't find
the source of the goods.

69
00:03:02,150 --> 00:03:02,870
Not surprising.

70
00:03:03,520 --> 00:03:04,840
They wouldn't dare take such a risk

71
00:03:05,120 --> 00:03:06,590
without a foolproof method.

72
00:03:07,150 --> 00:03:09,430
These are just the overt records.

73
00:03:09,590 --> 00:03:11,430
There are also many clues
hidden between the lines.

74
00:03:12,310 --> 00:03:13,190
What do you mean?

75
00:03:13,360 --> 00:03:14,430
When keeping accounts,

76
00:03:14,520 --> 00:03:16,840
each family has its own coded language.

77
00:03:17,080 --> 00:03:17,840
Coded language?

78
00:03:20,560 --> 00:03:21,680
Back when I was in the Su...

79
00:03:26,750 --> 00:03:27,590
That was close.

80
00:03:27,960 --> 00:03:29,190
I almost slipped up.

81
00:03:31,240 --> 00:03:31,870
Well,

82
00:03:31,870 --> 00:03:33,470
may I see the secret accounts?

83
00:03:34,150 --> 00:03:36,120
Su Yunqing used to mention the Su family's

84
00:03:36,120 --> 00:03:37,470
coded language in business.

85
00:03:37,750 --> 00:03:39,150
Let me see if I can match it up.

86
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:49,190
Take notes for me.

87
00:03:50,310 --> 00:03:52,150
There's something fishy
about the expenditures on the 16th.

88
00:03:52,240 --> 00:03:53,680
The Su family's rule is

89
00:03:53,960 --> 00:03:56,150
that two-character names
must have titles prefixed,

90
00:03:56,150 --> 00:03:58,280
while three-character names must not.

91
00:03:58,680 --> 00:04:00,000
Otherwise, it's coded language.

92
00:04:01,590 --> 00:04:04,910
Liu, Yue, Wang, Zai, Zhong, Shen

93
00:04:05,360 --> 00:04:06,910
correspond to one, two,
three, four, five, six.

94
00:04:07,520 --> 00:04:08,800
"Chen" stands for Shen.

95
00:04:09,470 --> 00:04:10,750
So here, "Chen" means six.

96
00:04:11,120 --> 00:04:12,750
Character "Fan" has three strokes.
Three signifies a hundred.

97
00:04:13,120 --> 00:04:13,910
So

98
00:04:14,150 --> 00:04:15,520
six hundred taels
have been falsely reported here.

99
00:04:15,680 --> 00:04:16,720
"Liu" for Liu.

100
00:04:16,720 --> 00:04:17,630
"Liu" means one.

101
00:04:17,920 --> 00:04:19,600
[Liu Hongcai]
"Cai" in given name with three strokes.

102
00:04:20,560 --> 00:04:21,600
Three signifies a hundred.

103
00:04:22,070 --> 00:04:22,680
Here,

104
00:04:22,870 --> 00:04:24,070
one hundred taels
have been falsely reported.

105
00:04:25,120 --> 00:04:27,600
"Zhang" for Zhang. Zhang means eight.

106
00:04:45,510 --> 00:04:46,390
It matches.

107
00:04:46,830 --> 00:04:49,920
The falsely reported amount is
exactly 74,000 taels.

108
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:53,750
How dare the Su family

109
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:55,920
swindle us like this?

110
00:04:57,040 --> 00:04:57,870
Zhaohua,

111
00:04:58,360 --> 00:05:00,630
just how much have you hidden from me?

112
00:05:01,070 --> 00:05:02,000
Mr. Shen,

113
00:05:02,120 --> 00:05:04,430
Miss Su is waiting for you
in the council hall.

114
00:05:24,240 --> 00:05:25,270
The falsification

115
00:05:25,270 --> 00:05:27,120
did occur under my family's oversight.

116
00:05:27,510 --> 00:05:29,510
But we are also victims.

117
00:05:29,600 --> 00:05:31,120
You're welcome to investigate.

118
00:05:31,240 --> 00:05:32,630
Su Yunqing was in charge

119
00:05:32,630 --> 00:05:34,310
of financial matters in previous years.

120
00:05:34,870 --> 00:05:36,360
Now that she's unconscious,

121
00:05:36,480 --> 00:05:37,720
I'm worried sick.

122
00:05:38,070 --> 00:05:38,950
So

123
00:05:39,680 --> 00:05:41,390
I've been dragged into this after all.

124
00:05:41,510 --> 00:05:43,270
You deliberately put Su Yunqing

125
00:05:43,270 --> 00:05:44,870
in charge of the Su family's finances.

126
00:05:45,160 --> 00:05:47,800
You exploited her trust
to cook the books

127
00:05:48,310 --> 00:05:49,000
while

128
00:05:49,270 --> 00:05:50,870
colluding with the Shens

129
00:05:50,870 --> 00:05:52,830
to embezzle funds
and issue illegal loans.

130
00:05:53,720 --> 00:05:54,950
Later, the account books were stolen.

131
00:05:55,270 --> 00:05:57,430
You were afraid of being discovered
by the Su family.

132
00:05:57,800 --> 00:05:58,560
So

133
00:05:59,120 --> 00:06:01,240
you faked your disappearance
and hid your identity.

134
00:06:01,870 --> 00:06:03,510
After Su Yunqing fell into a coma,

135
00:06:03,630 --> 00:06:05,870
you seized the opportunity to return
the Su family

136
00:06:05,950 --> 00:06:07,920
and took over its finances.

137
00:06:10,310 --> 00:06:12,920
I was just heartbroken
after our broken betrothal

138
00:06:12,920 --> 00:06:14,480
and needed time to recover.

139
00:06:14,830 --> 00:06:16,240
Besides, these are

140
00:06:16,240 --> 00:06:17,680
just your baseless accusations.

141
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:19,000
Do you have any proof?

142
00:06:19,560 --> 00:06:20,720
If you do,

143
00:06:20,720 --> 00:06:22,240
go ahead and sue me.

144
00:06:23,560 --> 00:06:25,750
You once schemed to replace Su Yunqing

145
00:06:26,070 --> 00:06:27,510
as my bride,

146
00:06:27,750 --> 00:06:29,950
just to pin your crimes

147
00:06:30,120 --> 00:06:31,510
on her.

148
00:06:31,510 --> 00:06:32,800
Now you're

149
00:06:32,830 --> 00:06:34,680
being a bit distant.

150
00:06:35,190 --> 00:06:36,870
I did want to marry you.

151
00:06:37,430 --> 00:06:39,000
But I really don't understand

152
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:41,310
what you see in Su Yunqing.

153
00:06:41,920 --> 00:06:43,000
Do you even know?

154
00:06:43,240 --> 00:06:44,160
Su Yunqing is just

155
00:06:44,160 --> 00:06:45,830
a lapdog my father gave me.

156
00:06:45,950 --> 00:06:47,070
A little kindness from me,

157
00:06:47,070 --> 00:06:48,190
and she'd call me dear sister non-stop.

158
00:06:48,480 --> 00:06:49,830
Isn't she just pathetic?

159
00:06:50,310 --> 00:06:51,070
Speak!

160
00:06:51,480 --> 00:06:52,870
Who in the Shen family

161
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:54,070
was your accomplice?

162
00:06:56,480 --> 00:06:57,600
Are you furious now?

163
00:06:58,070 --> 00:06:59,390
Does it hurt to hear her insulted?

164
00:06:59,630 --> 00:07:00,830
But I'll keep insulting her!

165
00:07:01,680 --> 00:07:03,430
What's so great about Su Yunqing?

166
00:07:03,430 --> 00:07:04,800
Everyone adores her!

167
00:07:05,160 --> 00:07:05,800
In her presence,

168
00:07:05,800 --> 00:07:06,510
everyone forgets

169
00:07:06,600 --> 00:07:08,120
I'm the heiress of the Su family.

170
00:07:08,310 --> 00:07:09,920
She's nothing but a...

171
00:07:19,800 --> 00:07:20,680
Are you alright?

172
00:07:21,870 --> 00:07:22,920
Wake up.

173
00:07:23,430 --> 00:07:24,600
Open your eyes.

174
00:07:24,600 --> 00:07:25,600
Please.

175
00:07:25,600 --> 00:07:26,310
Su Zhaohua,

176
00:07:26,310 --> 00:07:27,120
wake up.

177
00:07:27,510 --> 00:07:28,390
Wake up.

178
00:07:28,480 --> 00:07:29,240
Open your eyes

179
00:07:29,240 --> 00:07:29,720
and look at me.

180
00:07:29,720 --> 00:07:30,600
The tea was poisoned.

181
00:07:30,600 --> 00:07:31,430
Su Zhaohua.

182
00:07:32,600 --> 00:07:34,950
There's still so much I need to ask you.

183
00:07:35,630 --> 00:07:37,190
Please, just open your eyes

184
00:07:37,190 --> 00:07:38,680
and look at me.

185
00:07:39,040 --> 00:07:41,480
I'm begging you.

186
00:07:41,830 --> 00:07:42,920
Su Zhaohua,

187
00:07:42,920 --> 00:07:45,070
don't leave me!

188
00:07:45,800 --> 00:07:47,720
How could she

189
00:07:47,800 --> 00:07:50,240
just drop dead here?

190
00:07:50,430 --> 00:07:52,510
How do we explain this to the Su family?

191
00:07:53,240 --> 00:07:54,510
The rumors already claimed

192
00:07:54,510 --> 00:07:55,720
she died here before.

193
00:07:56,160 --> 00:07:57,480
There were no issues

194
00:07:57,630 --> 00:07:59,270
when the First Madam was around.

195
00:07:59,510 --> 00:08:01,240
Of all times,

196
00:08:01,240 --> 00:08:03,040
why now?

197
00:08:05,430 --> 00:08:06,480
Second Madam, forgive me.

198
00:08:06,870 --> 00:08:08,920
My mind wandered for a moment.

199
00:08:09,480 --> 00:08:10,750
Look at the two of you.

200
00:08:11,120 --> 00:08:12,270
Terrified

201
00:08:12,270 --> 00:08:13,600
over such a trivial matter.

202
00:08:15,510 --> 00:08:17,190
If the Shen family
is left in your hands,

203
00:08:17,720 --> 00:08:18,480
ruin

204
00:08:18,950 --> 00:08:20,800
is inevitable.

205
00:08:23,360 --> 00:08:24,870
Then what do you suggest?

206
00:08:25,630 --> 00:08:26,720
I think

207
00:08:27,560 --> 00:08:29,600
we could just bury her somewhere.

208
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:30,950
If the Su family comes asking,

209
00:08:31,270 --> 00:08:32,750
we simply deny she was ever here.

210
00:08:33,480 --> 00:08:35,790
It's not like
they can cause trouble anyway.

211
00:08:36,480 --> 00:08:37,080
Third Madam,

212
00:08:37,080 --> 00:08:39,000
you speak so lightly of a human life.

213
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:39,910
Have you taken her

214
00:08:39,910 --> 00:08:41,480
for one of the maids here?

215
00:08:41,480 --> 00:08:42,360
How dare you!

216
00:08:43,080 --> 00:08:44,510
This isn't your place to talk.

217
00:08:48,150 --> 00:08:48,840
Second Madam,

218
00:08:49,790 --> 00:08:51,120
the tea was tested earlier.

219
00:08:51,600 --> 00:08:53,320
Though no poison was found,

220
00:08:53,870 --> 00:08:54,630
it did

221
00:08:54,870 --> 00:08:56,630
come from you.

222
00:08:57,030 --> 00:08:58,000
If we report this,

223
00:08:58,200 --> 00:08:59,200
I'm afraid

224
00:08:59,440 --> 00:09:01,480
you'll be taken in for questioning.

225
00:09:03,440 --> 00:09:04,510
Xingyan also

226
00:09:04,510 --> 00:09:06,080
laid hands on Su Zhaohua.

227
00:09:07,200 --> 00:09:09,000
He's a suspect too.

228
00:09:10,300 --> 00:09:11,660
If you want to report this,

229
00:09:11,660 --> 00:09:12,820
I have no objections.

230
00:09:13,700 --> 00:09:16,860
But both you and your son

231
00:09:16,860 --> 00:09:18,660
might end up like the First Madam.

232
00:09:18,780 --> 00:09:20,100
Think carefully.

233
00:09:20,740 --> 00:09:21,780
Why bother reporting this?

234
00:09:22,740 --> 00:09:23,660
Pretend she was never here!

235
00:09:23,660 --> 00:09:24,660
Just bury her!

236
00:09:25,820 --> 00:09:26,540
Third Madam,

237
00:09:26,740 --> 00:09:28,580
handle this as you see fit.

238
00:09:30,700 --> 00:09:31,580
I've got a headache.

239
00:09:32,540 --> 00:09:33,460
Then I'll take care of it.

240
00:09:35,140 --> 00:09:37,180
In compounding medicines,
observe compatibility.

241
00:09:37,180 --> 00:09:40,100
Roasting, frying, and boiling
must never clash.

242
00:09:42,740 --> 00:09:45,140
So you know the Nineteen Medicaments
of Mutual Restraint.

243
00:09:48,460 --> 00:09:49,980
What's that?

244
00:09:50,900 --> 00:09:52,060
You're talking nonsense.

245
00:09:59,260 --> 00:10:00,020
Qiuyue,

246
00:10:00,460 --> 00:10:02,180
what did you mean earlier?

247
00:10:03,460 --> 00:10:04,340
I've heard

248
00:10:04,540 --> 00:10:05,140
many herbs

249
00:10:05,140 --> 00:10:07,020
are beneficial when taken alone,

250
00:10:07,620 --> 00:10:09,860
but become deadly poisons
when combined.

251
00:10:10,460 --> 00:10:12,380
Like this blood ginseng tea.

252
00:10:12,700 --> 00:10:14,140
The Second Madam uses it

253
00:10:14,140 --> 00:10:15,260
to nourish her health,

254
00:10:15,780 --> 00:10:17,380
proving its worth as a tonic.

255
00:10:18,060 --> 00:10:19,540
But who knows

256
00:10:19,540 --> 00:10:20,980
what red ginseng reacts with

257
00:10:21,580 --> 00:10:23,260
causing people to die?

258
00:10:28,020 --> 00:10:29,260
Are you speaking the truth?

259
00:10:29,980 --> 00:10:30,820
Could blood ginseng truly

260
00:10:31,100 --> 00:10:32,660
be lethal?

261
00:10:33,220 --> 00:10:35,660
All medicinal substances
have contraindications.

262
00:10:37,100 --> 00:10:38,100
Too bad

263
00:10:38,660 --> 00:10:40,900
what Su Zhaohua ingested before

264
00:10:41,820 --> 00:10:43,260
may forever remain a mystery.

265
00:10:46,980 --> 00:10:49,780
The Fourth Madam wants proof
of the Third Madam's poisoning.

266
00:10:50,300 --> 00:10:51,820
No doubt it will

267
00:10:52,060 --> 00:10:53,500
advance her own schemes.

268
00:10:57,380 --> 00:10:58,980
That maid Qiuyue must be silenced.

269
00:10:59,660 --> 00:11:01,380
I thought the Second Madam's stupidity

270
00:11:01,380 --> 00:11:02,500
made her harmless.

271
00:11:03,380 --> 00:11:05,180
But with Qiuyue advising her...

272
00:11:05,740 --> 00:11:07,140
If they learn

273
00:11:07,220 --> 00:11:08,340
I killed Su Zhaohua,

274
00:11:09,020 --> 00:11:10,140
the secret accounts

275
00:11:10,140 --> 00:11:11,100
will be exposed.

276
00:11:12,700 --> 00:11:14,180
And I've heard

277
00:11:14,940 --> 00:11:17,260
the Master wasn't murdered
by the First Madam.

278
00:11:17,980 --> 00:11:19,780
She'll be released soon.

279
00:11:20,060 --> 00:11:20,700
Oh no.

280
00:11:21,780 --> 00:11:22,900
We're doomed.

281
00:11:23,260 --> 00:11:24,460
If the First Madam returns,

282
00:11:24,540 --> 00:11:25,740
they'll expose

283
00:11:25,740 --> 00:11:26,340
the secret accounts.

284
00:11:27,900 --> 00:11:28,700
What do we do?

285
00:11:29,140 --> 00:11:30,060
Matters will only worsen

286
00:11:30,060 --> 00:11:31,300
when that day comes.

287
00:11:32,020 --> 00:11:33,220
I must strike first.

288
00:11:33,940 --> 00:11:35,100
I must strike first.

289
00:11:35,660 --> 00:11:36,660
Madam, calm yourself.

290
00:11:37,820 --> 00:11:38,500
Better

291
00:11:39,460 --> 00:11:41,420
to finish what we've started.

292
00:11:42,460 --> 00:11:43,660
We'll seize this chance

293
00:11:44,500 --> 00:11:46,140
to eliminate the First Madam.
