2
00:00:31,020 --> 00:00:32,700
What are you doing, Mr. Shen?

3
00:00:33,900 --> 00:00:35,620
[Zhou Furong cheated on you.]
Tell me, what are you trying to do?

4
00:00:35,620 --> 00:00:36,100
[Come back soon!]

5
00:00:37,260 --> 00:00:38,420
To be honest, Mr. Chen,

6
00:00:38,780 --> 00:00:39,900
I was sent by First Madam

7
00:00:39,900 --> 00:00:41,260
to keep an eye on Mrs. Chen.

8
00:00:41,740 --> 00:00:42,900
But I never expected

9
00:00:42,900 --> 00:00:44,260
she would have an affair.

10
00:00:45,060 --> 00:00:46,500
I couldn't let you be humiliated,

11
00:00:46,900 --> 00:00:49,580
so I told you right away.

12
00:00:51,660 --> 00:00:53,580
You think that'll work on me?

13
00:00:55,620 --> 00:00:56,860
Then you can just kill me.

14
00:00:59,740 --> 00:01:01,940
Madams are coming to catch them.

15
00:01:03,020 --> 00:01:03,940
Just think,

16
00:01:04,820 --> 00:01:07,580
what will they do to her

17
00:01:08,860 --> 00:01:10,380
when they find her cheating?

18
00:01:19,380 --> 00:01:20,340
Without me,

19
00:01:20,900 --> 00:01:22,220
no one can lead the way.

20
00:01:22,460 --> 00:01:24,300
Just get ready to collect her corpse.

21
00:01:24,300 --> 00:01:25,340
Take me to her.

22
00:01:26,620 --> 00:01:27,820
I'm afraid

23
00:01:27,820 --> 00:01:29,620
I can't do that, Mr. Shen.

24
00:01:30,260 --> 00:01:31,140
Unless...

25
00:01:31,260 --> 00:01:32,860
You dare bargain with me?

26
00:01:34,260 --> 00:01:35,940
If you won't agree,

27
00:01:35,940 --> 00:01:37,420
then do whatever you want to me.

28
00:01:50,660 --> 00:01:52,180
What exactly do you want?

29
00:02:00,740 --> 00:02:02,380
I want to be your wife.

30
00:02:03,020 --> 00:02:04,900
I want you to divorce Zhou Furong.

31
00:02:06,020 --> 00:02:06,660
No,

32
00:02:10,580 --> 00:02:11,380
to be exact,

33
00:02:11,900 --> 00:02:13,300
I want you to divorce Su Yunqing.

[Divorce Letter]

35
00:02:25,460 --> 00:02:26,900
That wretched woman...

36
00:02:27,020 --> 00:02:28,060
I knew she was bad news

37
00:02:28,060 --> 00:02:29,180
from the very beginning.

38
00:02:29,180 --> 00:02:30,580
She's disgraced our whole family!

39
00:02:31,580 --> 00:02:32,220
Watch out.

40
00:02:32,900 --> 00:02:34,300
When bad luck hits,

41
00:02:34,300 --> 00:02:35,620
even water breaks your teeth!

42
00:02:38,620 --> 00:02:40,140
Zhou Furong, you filthy wench!

43
00:02:40,220 --> 00:02:42,340
What are you doing in there?

44
00:02:43,500 --> 00:02:44,620
Open the door!

45
00:02:46,140 --> 00:02:47,340
What are you doing?

46
00:02:47,500 --> 00:02:48,300
Filthy wench!

47
00:03:00,340 --> 00:03:01,140
You,

48
00:03:01,580 --> 00:03:01,980
Zhou...

49
00:03:02,300 --> 00:03:03,300
Zhou Furong,

50
00:03:03,300 --> 00:03:04,660
have I ever wronged you?

51
00:03:04,740 --> 00:03:06,340
Has Xingyan ever wronged you?

52
00:03:06,620 --> 00:03:07,260
How could you

53
00:03:07,420 --> 00:03:09,660
do something so shameless?

54
00:03:09,700 --> 00:03:10,900
Why are you all standing there?

55
00:03:10,940 --> 00:03:12,820
Go catch that man!

56
00:03:18,700 --> 00:03:20,260
Still won't tell us, huh?

57
00:03:20,580 --> 00:03:23,020
Want to die for that son of a gun?

58
00:03:23,940 --> 00:03:24,980
I'd told you before,

59
00:03:26,140 --> 00:03:28,220
I was framed by Qiuyue!

60
00:03:29,020 --> 00:03:30,620
I'm innocent!

61
00:03:31,140 --> 00:03:32,020
Innocent?

62
00:03:32,460 --> 00:03:33,740
You mean she lured you out at midnight

63
00:03:33,740 --> 00:03:35,140
to meet a man in secret?

64
00:03:35,460 --> 00:03:37,460
I caught you in bed
and you still deny it.

65
00:03:39,020 --> 00:03:40,220
Keep beating

66
00:03:40,220 --> 00:03:42,060
till she confesses who that man is!

67
00:03:42,780 --> 00:03:43,500
Wait.

68
00:03:44,940 --> 00:03:45,780
Second Madam,

69
00:03:46,260 --> 00:03:47,940
please calm down.

70
00:03:48,380 --> 00:03:50,100
She's still the young mistress.

71
00:03:50,300 --> 00:03:51,140
Ha!

72
00:03:51,340 --> 00:03:52,940
She doesn't deserve that title!

73
00:03:53,060 --> 00:03:54,380
Adultery is punishable by death.

74
00:03:54,700 --> 00:03:55,980
Confess

75
00:03:56,140 --> 00:03:57,460
or I'll force you!

76
00:03:58,140 --> 00:03:59,900
This's a family scandal,

77
00:04:00,340 --> 00:04:01,860
so keep your voice down.

78
00:04:05,860 --> 00:04:07,100
Still not talking?

79
00:04:07,580 --> 00:04:08,260
Fine.

80
00:04:08,900 --> 00:04:10,860
Drown her in the vat!

81
00:04:14,140 --> 00:04:14,940
You shameless woman!

82
00:04:14,940 --> 00:04:15,660
Speak up!

83
00:04:20,180 --> 00:04:22,140
Thank you for helping me
with the jewelry last time.

84
00:04:24,220 --> 00:04:26,260
I've hidden osmanthus honey here.

85
00:04:26,260 --> 00:04:27,380
Very sweet.

86
00:04:30,580 --> 00:04:31,500
Mr. Shen.

87
00:04:31,820 --> 00:04:33,060
You're right.

88
00:04:33,060 --> 00:04:33,740
It's me!

89
00:04:33,740 --> 00:04:35,580
So this is how it feels

90
00:04:35,780 --> 00:04:37,100
to be betrayed by someone you trust.

91
00:04:39,100 --> 00:04:39,900
Qiuyue,

92
00:04:40,780 --> 00:04:42,620
thank you for the final lesson.

93
00:04:48,300 --> 00:04:49,980
If I survive today,

94
00:04:50,700 --> 00:04:52,660
I'll make you regret it.

95
00:04:53,420 --> 00:04:54,620
Still won't talk?

96
00:04:54,620 --> 00:04:55,380
Keep drowning her!

97
00:04:56,340 --> 00:04:57,140
Stop!

98
00:05:06,020 --> 00:05:07,260
Who told you to do this?

99
00:05:08,220 --> 00:05:09,780
You have no humanity!

100
00:05:10,700 --> 00:05:11,420
My son,

101
00:05:11,700 --> 00:05:13,340
do you know what this wench has done?

102
00:05:13,340 --> 00:05:14,220
First,

103
00:05:14,620 --> 00:05:15,860
I don't need you to tell me

104
00:05:16,100 --> 00:05:17,740
what kind of woman she is.

105
00:05:18,100 --> 00:05:18,860
Second,

106
00:05:19,180 --> 00:05:20,860
what did she do

107
00:05:20,860 --> 00:05:21,580
and how to deal with her

108
00:05:21,580 --> 00:05:22,700
are my business,

109
00:05:23,660 --> 00:05:25,460
not yours.

110
00:05:25,940 --> 00:05:27,700
How can you say that?

111
00:05:27,980 --> 00:05:28,580
She...

112
00:05:28,580 --> 00:05:30,220
She's already cheated on you!

113
00:05:30,260 --> 00:05:31,380
And you still defend her?

114
00:05:31,780 --> 00:05:34,660
Since he says it's his business,

115
00:05:35,100 --> 00:05:36,940
let's hear him out.

116
00:05:44,820 --> 00:05:46,820
I asked Qiuyue to come with her.

117
00:05:47,620 --> 00:05:48,780
The man she met.

118
00:05:49,300 --> 00:05:50,820
I arranged that.

119
00:05:51,780 --> 00:05:53,060
I did all this

120
00:05:55,260 --> 00:05:56,740
to divorce her.

121
00:05:59,340 --> 00:06:00,500
I want Qiuyue to be my wife.

122
00:06:06,820 --> 00:06:07,340
Tell me,

123
00:06:07,500 --> 00:06:08,940
what happened?

124
00:06:09,180 --> 00:06:10,260
Yes, Second Madam.

125
00:06:10,620 --> 00:06:11,900
I'm already pregnant.

126
00:06:12,340 --> 00:06:14,180
It's Mr. Shen's child.

127
00:06:19,060 --> 00:06:20,060
Really?

128
00:06:22,180 --> 00:06:23,020
Absolutely.

129
00:06:25,180 --> 00:06:27,020
Was it that night in the study?

130
00:06:34,620 --> 00:06:36,460
Not just that night.

131
00:06:38,260 --> 00:06:39,820
There were many more.

132
00:06:40,180 --> 00:06:42,380
We've done plenty in secret.

133
00:06:47,980 --> 00:06:49,860
He won't tell you about these.

134
00:07:01,040 --> 00:07:02,160
Shen Xingyan.

135
00:07:02,360 --> 00:07:03,840
Tell me it's a lie!

136
00:07:12,190 --> 00:07:13,110
It's true.

137
00:07:15,070 --> 00:07:16,840
I'm marrying Qiuyue soon.

138
00:07:17,870 --> 00:07:19,400
Don't be silly.

139
00:07:20,240 --> 00:07:21,670
Pack your things

140
00:07:21,670 --> 00:07:22,870
and leave Shen family.

141
00:07:24,070 --> 00:07:26,040
Don't end up like Su Zhaohua.

142
00:07:27,720 --> 00:07:28,430
At the scene,

143
00:07:28,990 --> 00:07:30,960
if she'd broken off the marriage,

144
00:07:31,670 --> 00:07:33,160
and stopped clinging to me,

145
00:07:33,920 --> 00:07:36,280
she wouldn't have gone missing.

146
00:07:36,550 --> 00:07:37,280
So it was all

147
00:07:37,670 --> 00:07:39,240
a misunderstanding.

148
00:07:40,070 --> 00:07:41,990
Let Zhou Furong go.

149
00:07:42,920 --> 00:07:44,360
If this gets out,

150
00:07:44,630 --> 00:07:46,670
Shen family's name will suffer.

151
00:07:48,190 --> 00:07:51,360
As for Xingyan and Qiuyue,

152
00:07:51,800 --> 00:07:53,800
we'll discuss the marriage at home.

153
00:07:56,550 --> 00:07:58,110
You brat!

[Divorce Letter]

155
00:08:40,630 --> 00:08:41,720
Qiuyue,

156
00:08:41,990 --> 00:08:43,360
Shen Xingyan,

157
00:08:44,110 --> 00:08:46,560
I will make you both pay!
