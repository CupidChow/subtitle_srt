00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:10,080
[Guilty Maid]
[Episode 8]

2
00:00:16,660 --> 00:00:18,940
Poor Miss Zhou.

3
00:00:21,580 --> 00:00:22,300
Second Madam,

4
00:00:22,380 --> 00:00:24,060
you must stand up for us.

5
00:00:24,420 --> 00:00:27,140
Miss Zhou accidentally
injured Cuiqiao yesterday.

6
00:00:27,340 --> 00:00:28,940
Today she specially prepared dowry

7
00:00:28,940 --> 00:00:30,300
to make amends.

8
00:00:30,660 --> 00:00:32,700
Yet Cuiqiao refused the gesture

9
00:00:32,940 --> 00:00:33,500
and even flung the pollen

10
00:00:33,500 --> 00:00:35,740
right into Miss Zhou's face!

11
00:00:36,620 --> 00:00:37,660
Is this true,

12
00:00:37,660 --> 00:00:38,460
Cuiqiao?

13
00:00:40,780 --> 00:00:42,340
Dowry as an apology?

14
00:00:43,660 --> 00:00:45,220
Then if she harmed Miss Zhou,

15
00:00:46,100 --> 00:00:48,660
could I offer dowry on her behalf
to make amends?

16
00:00:49,580 --> 00:00:50,420
Mr. Shen,

17
00:00:50,740 --> 00:00:51,180
this...

18
00:00:51,420 --> 00:00:52,700
This is different.

19
00:00:53,580 --> 00:00:54,380
Absurd.

20
00:00:54,940 --> 00:00:56,500
If Miss Zhou can atone

21
00:00:56,660 --> 00:00:58,220
for harming someone with dowry,

22
00:00:58,220 --> 00:00:59,340
why can't Cuiqiao?

23
00:01:00,780 --> 00:01:03,140
Is it because my woman is unworthy,

24
00:01:03,580 --> 00:01:05,140
or is it because the Shen family
is unworthy?

25
00:01:06,260 --> 00:01:07,100
Mr. Shen,

26
00:01:07,100 --> 00:01:08,380
look at how severely injured

27
00:01:08,420 --> 00:01:10,300
Miss Zhou is now!

28
00:01:10,460 --> 00:01:11,420
She did it on purpose!

29
00:01:12,420 --> 00:01:13,380
On purpose?

30
00:01:19,340 --> 00:01:21,140
Whether she acted deliberately,
I cannot say.

31
00:01:21,340 --> 00:01:22,500
But I certainly did.

32
00:01:23,220 --> 00:01:24,500
If you have the courage,

33
00:01:24,980 --> 00:01:26,380
you're welcome to come at me.

34
00:01:27,220 --> 00:01:28,420
Let's see

35
00:01:28,700 --> 00:01:30,380
whether it's the pollen that's poisonous

36
00:01:30,700 --> 00:01:33,340
or Miss Zhou, who's the problem.

37
00:01:37,260 --> 00:01:38,180
Miss.

38
00:01:38,580 --> 00:01:39,060
Shen Xingyan,

39
00:01:39,060 --> 00:01:40,180
just you wait!

40
00:01:41,100 --> 00:01:42,780
This is beyond humiliation!

41
00:01:42,900 --> 00:01:44,780
I have no idea
what you're talking about.

42
00:01:44,980 --> 00:01:47,380
Let's consider it your blessing to us.

43
00:01:47,940 --> 00:01:48,940
Leave the dowry.

44
00:01:49,620 --> 00:01:50,860
You may go.

45
00:01:51,100 --> 00:01:51,660
You...

46
00:01:51,900 --> 00:01:52,460
You...

47
00:01:52,700 --> 00:01:54,860
Since she's gifted you
the principal wife's dowry,

48
00:01:55,340 --> 00:01:56,780
you may as well accept it.

49
00:01:58,180 --> 00:01:59,940
If any of it doesn't fit,

50
00:02:00,300 --> 00:02:01,620
send it back to them

51
00:02:02,020 --> 00:02:03,460
for alterations.

52
00:02:06,860 --> 00:02:07,660
Miss.

53
00:02:10,260 --> 00:02:11,660
Hurry!

54
00:02:11,740 --> 00:02:12,860
Carry it inside.

55
00:02:15,700 --> 00:02:17,580
Though you've accepted the dowry,

56
00:02:17,780 --> 00:02:19,940
this place still

57
00:02:20,100 --> 00:02:20,700
looks wretched

58
00:02:20,700 --> 00:02:22,180
without proper furnishings.

59
00:02:23,500 --> 00:02:24,500
What are you muttering about?

60
00:02:25,140 --> 00:02:26,300
You're not making any sense.

61
00:02:27,260 --> 00:02:28,100
Did you ingest the pollen?

62
00:02:28,340 --> 00:02:29,020
You...

63
00:02:30,420 --> 00:02:31,180
Parrot every word

64
00:02:31,180 --> 00:02:32,220
I say.

65
00:02:33,380 --> 00:02:35,020
Look at this place.

66
00:02:35,140 --> 00:02:36,500
No ceremony,

67
00:02:36,900 --> 00:02:38,140
no servants.

68
00:02:38,700 --> 00:02:39,740
Not a single soul

69
00:02:39,980 --> 00:02:42,420
to wish you marital bliss.

70
00:02:45,060 --> 00:02:47,020
How bitterly unfair it must feel.

71
00:02:48,300 --> 00:02:49,700
Here you stand alone

72
00:02:49,900 --> 00:02:51,340
in your bridal red,

73
00:02:51,340 --> 00:02:52,980
surrounded by ruins.

74
00:02:53,220 --> 00:02:54,620
If I were you,

75
00:02:54,660 --> 00:02:56,780
I'd be wishing for death.

76
00:02:57,780 --> 00:02:59,420
Look at this place.

77
00:02:59,460 --> 00:03:00,460
No ceremony,

78
00:03:01,140 --> 00:03:02,340
no servants.

79
00:03:02,500 --> 00:03:03,740
Not a single soul

80
00:03:03,740 --> 00:03:05,460
to wish you marital bliss.

81
00:03:06,820 --> 00:03:07,820
If I were you,

82
00:03:07,820 --> 00:03:08,260
I'd be wishing...

83
00:03:08,260 --> 00:03:09,380
Enough.

84
00:03:10,020 --> 00:03:11,060
Told you to mimic her,

85
00:03:11,100 --> 00:03:12,180
not surpass her.

86
00:03:13,340 --> 00:03:14,180
So,

87
00:03:14,260 --> 00:03:15,460
you've come out of pity

88
00:03:15,460 --> 00:03:16,980
to deliver furniture, is that it?

89
00:03:17,460 --> 00:03:18,180
Well then, bring it in.

90
00:03:18,820 --> 00:03:20,260
No reason to refuse free gifts.

91
00:04:11,660 --> 00:04:13,060
Look at this place.

92
00:04:13,500 --> 00:04:15,940
No ceremony, no servants.

93
00:04:16,420 --> 00:04:17,580
Not a single soul

94
00:04:17,580 --> 00:04:19,340
to wish you marital bliss.

95
00:04:20,340 --> 00:04:22,140
Here you stand alone in your bridal red,

96
00:04:22,220 --> 00:04:23,780
surrounded by ruins.

97
00:04:23,980 --> 00:04:25,060
How bitterly unfair it must feel.

98
00:04:25,060 --> 00:04:26,220
It's a curse.

99
00:04:26,580 --> 00:04:28,420
It could transform you
into someone else.

100
00:04:28,940 --> 00:04:30,980
You might become a filthy beggar

101
00:04:31,220 --> 00:04:32,980
or a rather sharp-tongued elder.

102
00:04:33,460 --> 00:04:34,100
Anyway,

103
00:04:34,580 --> 00:04:36,060
no one will ever love you.

104
00:04:36,780 --> 00:04:38,340
No one.

105
00:04:39,180 --> 00:04:41,140
He couldn't even bother
with proper wedding attire.

106
00:04:42,860 --> 00:04:44,380
Let alone receive
anyone's blessings for us.

107
00:04:46,340 --> 00:04:47,340
I'm just a maid
brought in to bring luck,

108
00:04:47,340 --> 00:04:48,980
lower in status than a concubine.

109
00:04:50,660 --> 00:04:51,580
I'm merely a pawn for the Second Madam

110
00:04:51,580 --> 00:04:53,220
to secure her position.

111
00:05:09,780 --> 00:05:11,620
This lacquer smells off.

112
00:05:13,180 --> 00:05:14,620
The plants were just watered.

113
00:05:15,060 --> 00:05:16,300
But they're withered.

114
00:05:25,380 --> 00:05:26,460
The leaves are dead.

115
00:05:27,260 --> 00:05:28,380
The lacquer is poisoned.

116
00:05:35,700 --> 00:05:37,740
Failing to frame me, you resorted
to poisoning the lacquer.

117
00:05:38,300 --> 00:05:39,060
Zhou Furong,

118
00:05:39,380 --> 00:05:41,060
your malice knows no bounds.

119
00:05:42,860 --> 00:05:43,900
Thankfully, I carry

120
00:05:43,900 --> 00:05:45,460
an antidote sachet.

121
00:05:45,940 --> 00:05:46,860
Otherwise,

122
00:05:47,700 --> 00:05:49,700
I'd be suffering tonight.

123
00:05:57,700 --> 00:05:59,340
Grant me a sliver of hope,

124
00:05:59,940 --> 00:06:00,660
and

125
00:06:00,900 --> 00:06:02,620
we may yet coexist in peace.

126
00:06:20,660 --> 00:06:21,980
Let's see

127
00:06:22,100 --> 00:06:23,820
what this antidote

128
00:06:23,820 --> 00:06:25,140
of yours is.

129
00:06:27,700 --> 00:06:28,260
Oh no!

130
00:06:28,300 --> 00:06:29,220
It's pollen!

131
00:06:34,780 --> 00:06:35,700
Is anyone there?

132
00:06:35,940 --> 00:06:36,780
Help!

133
00:06:37,860 --> 00:06:38,700
Help me.

134
00:06:40,260 --> 00:06:41,140
Help me.

135
00:07:03,780 --> 00:07:06,740
When Mr. Shen was to marry
Miss Su of the Su family,

136
00:07:06,900 --> 00:07:08,620
she vanished on their wedding day.

137
00:07:09,060 --> 00:07:09,980
Rumors say

138
00:07:10,060 --> 00:07:12,060
Zhou Furong had her killed.

139
00:07:13,260 --> 00:07:15,060
First, you killed my sister.

140
00:07:16,020 --> 00:07:17,700
Now you come for me.

141
00:07:18,900 --> 00:07:20,420
I will find proof

142
00:07:21,300 --> 00:07:23,580
and see you punished as you deserve.

143
00:07:24,380 --> 00:07:26,300
But the Zhou family is powerful.

144
00:07:28,740 --> 00:07:29,940
No matter

145
00:07:30,340 --> 00:07:31,980
who's right or wrong,

146
00:07:32,500 --> 00:07:34,140
everyone will side with you.

147
00:07:34,140 --> 00:07:35,860
If you're found here

148
00:07:35,900 --> 00:07:37,140
like this,

149
00:07:37,460 --> 00:07:39,260
I'll be blamed.

150
00:07:42,860 --> 00:07:45,180
If I pretend to have been tied up
in the woodshed,

151
00:07:45,500 --> 00:07:47,700
they can't pin this on me.

152
00:07:51,060 --> 00:07:52,660
Why do I have this feeling again?

153
00:07:53,500 --> 00:07:54,420
Oh no.

154
00:08:06,820 --> 00:08:08,060
What's happening?

155
00:08:08,300 --> 00:08:09,620
Why can't I move?

156
00:08:10,460 --> 00:08:12,180
And why do I feel so terrible?

157
00:08:12,780 --> 00:08:13,860
Especially my face.

158
00:08:14,220 --> 00:08:15,340
It's so painful and itchy.

159
00:08:15,900 --> 00:08:17,460
Like my skin's been torn off.

160
00:08:19,900 --> 00:08:21,460
I've become Zhou Furong?

161
00:08:23,500 --> 00:08:25,940
Why do I always possess evil people?
