1
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:10,080
[Guilty Maid]
[Episode 2]

2
00:00:11,480 --> 00:00:12,640
Do not breathe a word

3
00:00:13,160 --> 00:00:14,670
about my visit to here today.

4
00:00:14,830 --> 00:00:15,670
Or

5
00:00:16,280 --> 00:00:18,230
you'll never learn
your sister's whereabouts.

6
00:00:18,870 --> 00:00:21,670
You mean my sister still lives?

7
00:00:22,870 --> 00:00:23,760
I said

8
00:00:23,760 --> 00:00:25,320
I'd tell you the truth

9
00:00:25,320 --> 00:00:26,710
if you could defeat me.

10
00:00:31,830 --> 00:00:35,070
So he implied my sister is still alive?

11
00:00:35,840 --> 00:00:38,000
Then what about the sachet found
in the mass graves?

12
00:00:39,110 --> 00:00:41,000
A pity he departs
for the capital tomorrow.

13
00:00:41,200 --> 00:00:43,150
Or I'd seize another chance to ask him.

14
00:00:43,150 --> 00:00:45,070
What are you two roaming at this hour?

15
00:00:47,240 --> 00:00:48,320
Sober now?

16
00:00:49,030 --> 00:00:50,150
Shall I douse you again?

17
00:00:52,110 --> 00:00:52,560
Yes...

18
00:00:52,560 --> 00:00:53,430
I'm sober.

19
00:00:53,670 --> 00:00:54,640
Ms. Rong, spare me!

20
00:00:54,920 --> 00:00:57,070
Sneaking out to drink
in the middle of the night,

21
00:00:57,350 --> 00:00:59,240
and even getting drunk.

22
00:00:59,790 --> 00:01:02,030
You two really think this is your place?

23
00:01:02,320 --> 00:01:02,960
Go

24
00:01:02,960 --> 00:01:04,310
get me the paddle.

25
00:01:04,560 --> 00:01:05,000
Ms. Rong, have mercy!

26
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:05,760
Let this be a lesson to all!

27
00:01:05,760 --> 00:01:06,590
Ms. Rong, have mercy!

28
00:01:06,760 --> 00:01:09,680
Defy the workshop rules,
and this is your fate!

29
00:01:09,840 --> 00:01:10,640
Ms. Rong, spare me!

30
00:01:11,120 --> 00:01:12,230
I was drugged!

31
00:01:12,310 --> 00:01:12,790
The congee...

32
00:01:12,790 --> 00:01:14,000
The congee is still on the stove.

33
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:16,000
Call a physician over to examine it.

34
00:01:16,790 --> 00:01:18,000
You wretch!

35
00:01:18,280 --> 00:01:21,680
How dare you slander
the Shen family's reputation?

36
00:01:22,560 --> 00:01:23,920
The sleeping draught looks dark.

37
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:25,310
It might not be noticeable in congee,

38
00:01:25,350 --> 00:01:27,150
but it's extremely obvious in water.

39
00:01:29,400 --> 00:01:30,790
Now I recall.

40
00:01:30,950 --> 00:01:34,000
You're the one who came here
searching for someone.

41
00:01:35,710 --> 00:01:37,070
You brat!

42
00:01:37,590 --> 00:01:40,350
To deceive me under my nose!

43
00:01:40,790 --> 00:01:41,680
Where's that paddle?

44
00:01:42,590 --> 00:01:43,280
Ms. Rong!

45
00:01:43,280 --> 00:01:44,280
Please judge wisely!

46
00:01:44,280 --> 00:01:45,070
I wasn't drugged.

47
00:01:45,400 --> 00:01:46,710
It was my own fault for being so sleepy!

48
00:01:46,840 --> 00:01:48,430
Ms. Rong, please spare Yunqing!

49
00:01:48,430 --> 00:01:49,230
Ms. Rong.

50
00:01:49,230 --> 00:01:50,640
Ms. Rong, please spare Yunqing!

51
00:01:53,230 --> 00:01:53,870
Get away!

52
00:01:54,120 --> 00:01:54,870
Qiuyue!

53
00:01:56,040 --> 00:01:58,230
What a lively scene this late at night.

54
00:02:02,840 --> 00:02:05,280
Fancy stumbling upon such a show

55
00:02:05,790 --> 00:02:07,400
during my evening stroll.

56
00:02:10,080 --> 00:02:10,910
Mr. Shen.

57
00:02:12,120 --> 00:02:14,190
Resorting to private punishment

58
00:02:14,310 --> 00:02:15,560
before proper investigation.

59
00:02:15,560 --> 00:02:16,430
Ms. Rong,

60
00:02:16,750 --> 00:02:18,840
is this how you manage the workshop?

61
00:02:35,470 --> 00:02:36,710
What grievance troubles you?

62
00:02:37,240 --> 00:02:39,030
Someone drugged my congee.

63
00:02:39,080 --> 00:02:41,470
Yet Ms. Rong insists we were drinking.

64
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:45,190
She slapped and struck us.

65
00:02:45,910 --> 00:02:47,280
It hurts terribly.

66
00:02:47,400 --> 00:02:48,240
Don't worry.

67
00:02:49,310 --> 00:02:50,800
I'll do you justice.

68
00:02:55,590 --> 00:02:56,910
Having witnessed this tonight,

69
00:02:57,430 --> 00:02:59,000
I can't turn a blind eye.

70
00:02:59,120 --> 00:03:00,150
Slap yourself

71
00:03:00,150 --> 00:03:01,080
four times.

72
00:03:02,470 --> 00:03:03,470
Mr. Shen,

73
00:03:03,470 --> 00:03:05,030
forgive my bluntness,

74
00:03:05,310 --> 00:03:07,030
but this is a workshop affair.

75
00:03:07,240 --> 00:03:09,000
And this is the dormitory
for female workers.

76
00:03:09,400 --> 00:03:11,680
Logically speaking,
you shouldn't be involved.

77
00:03:11,680 --> 00:03:12,840
Eight times.

78
00:03:14,240 --> 00:03:16,150
But I am the matron here.

79
00:03:16,150 --> 00:03:17,150
Sixteen times.

80
00:03:18,590 --> 00:03:19,710
Will you continue?

81
00:03:35,280 --> 00:03:36,030
Mr. Shen.

82
00:03:36,280 --> 00:03:37,000
Enough.

83
00:03:37,470 --> 00:03:39,630
Another instance of private punishment,

84
00:03:39,840 --> 00:03:40,870
and I won't spare you.

85
00:03:46,400 --> 00:03:49,560
[Fifteen days later]

86
00:03:53,680 --> 00:03:54,560
What's this?

87
00:03:54,840 --> 00:03:56,910
Perhaps with the Mr. Shen
poised for the top scholar,

88
00:03:56,910 --> 00:03:58,870
the Master fancies literary pursuits.

89
00:03:59,120 --> 00:03:59,910
Yunqing,

90
00:04:00,470 --> 00:04:02,870
do you think Mr. Shen likes me?

91
00:04:02,870 --> 00:04:04,310
You're moonstruck.

92
00:04:04,560 --> 00:04:06,240
Still can't get him out of your mind?

93
00:04:07,190 --> 00:04:08,150
Frankly,

94
00:04:08,150 --> 00:04:10,240
you'd better mind your own situation.

95
00:04:10,710 --> 00:04:12,120
Last time was mere luck.

96
00:04:12,120 --> 00:04:13,470
But hidden threats strike hardest.

97
00:04:16,360 --> 00:04:18,920
Mr. Shen has departed for the capital
for the imperial examination.

98
00:04:18,920 --> 00:04:21,190
Complete the madams' new jewelry soon.

99
00:04:21,750 --> 00:04:23,390
If they're not satisfied,

100
00:04:23,390 --> 00:04:24,750
punishment awaits you!

101
00:04:29,750 --> 00:04:31,630
Qiuyue's custom jewelry for
the Second Madam's trip to the capital

102
00:04:31,630 --> 00:04:32,800
is exquisite.

103
00:04:32,830 --> 00:04:33,720
Everyone, look!

104
00:04:33,720 --> 00:04:34,630
Shumeng, be careful.

105
00:04:34,630 --> 00:04:36,600
It's not sealed yet.

106
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:37,600
What is it?

107
00:04:37,680 --> 00:04:38,160
Oh, what's this?

108
00:04:38,160 --> 00:04:38,830
So beautiful.

109
00:04:39,040 --> 00:04:39,920
Look, what's this?

110
00:04:39,920 --> 00:04:40,600
Look.

111
00:04:43,120 --> 00:04:43,750
We should go.

112
00:04:44,310 --> 00:04:44,920
Let's leave.

113
00:04:44,920 --> 00:04:45,600
Seriously.

114
00:04:50,750 --> 00:04:52,430
Liuli, what are you doing?

115
00:04:52,750 --> 00:04:53,920
No wonder

116
00:04:54,070 --> 00:04:55,750
I feel something poking my foot.

117
00:04:56,270 --> 00:04:56,830
Go!

118
00:05:04,070 --> 00:05:05,390
The jade is cracked.

119
00:05:07,360 --> 00:05:08,430
What should I do?

120
00:05:08,630 --> 00:05:10,240
The Second Madam
will be here any moment.

121
00:05:16,480 --> 00:05:17,870
Then what will you do?

122
00:05:18,800 --> 00:05:19,750
I have a plan.

123
00:05:20,870 --> 00:05:22,070
The bead string

124
00:05:22,070 --> 00:05:24,160
best reflects one's refinement.

125
00:05:24,240 --> 00:05:25,390
Well done.

126
00:05:25,480 --> 00:05:26,750
[Second Madam]
All my guidance hasn't gone to...

127
00:05:29,830 --> 00:05:31,310
Such audacity!

128
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:33,750
While the madams vie for elegance,

129
00:05:33,950 --> 00:05:34,950
who

130
00:05:35,240 --> 00:05:37,070
dares insult the Second Madam

131
00:05:37,070 --> 00:05:38,160
with such inferior materials?

132
00:05:38,310 --> 00:05:39,950
You've got a death wish?

133
00:05:41,600 --> 00:05:43,240
What's so serious?

134
00:05:44,190 --> 00:05:45,070
Second Madam.

135
00:05:45,080 --> 00:05:46,080
[Second Madam of the Shen family]

136
00:05:48,470 --> 00:05:51,160
[Second Madam]

137
00:05:52,160 --> 00:05:53,390
Who made this?

138
00:05:56,630 --> 00:05:57,630
Answer me!

139
00:06:00,070 --> 00:06:00,830
I did.

140
00:06:03,070 --> 00:06:03,830
Second Madam,

141
00:06:04,160 --> 00:06:05,920
I have something to report in private.

142
00:06:09,270 --> 00:06:11,190
Second Madam, have you noticed
the Master's poem?

143
00:06:11,950 --> 00:06:14,480
Why would he post it in the workshop

144
00:06:14,750 --> 00:06:16,390
instead of his study?

145
00:06:17,160 --> 00:06:18,310
I suspect

146
00:06:18,560 --> 00:06:21,310
he's testing who truly cares
for the Shen family's business

147
00:06:21,310 --> 00:06:23,270
and who neglects the workshop.

148
00:06:23,310 --> 00:06:26,430
What does this poem have to do
with the bead string?

149
00:06:27,360 --> 00:06:29,120
A home made where footsteps tread.

150
00:06:29,120 --> 00:06:30,800
A fortune scattered like loose sand.

151
00:06:30,830 --> 00:06:33,070
It means that the fortunes
of merchant families are unpredictable.

152
00:06:33,160 --> 00:06:35,680
Even immense wealth
can be lost in an instant.

153
00:06:35,680 --> 00:06:37,600
One should not cling
to worldly possessions.

154
00:06:38,040 --> 00:06:39,720
Plain garments outshine the stars.

155
00:06:39,950 --> 00:06:41,750
Why chase jade flowers from the palace?

156
00:06:41,870 --> 00:06:43,830
This praises the beauty
in simple attire.

157
00:06:43,950 --> 00:06:45,720
The court frowns
upon mercantile families.

158
00:06:45,800 --> 00:06:47,430
If Mr. Shen becomes the top scholar,

159
00:06:47,600 --> 00:06:49,830
the Shen family will surely give up
half of the wealth.

160
00:06:50,480 --> 00:06:52,040
Thus, modesty in dress

161
00:06:52,040 --> 00:06:53,560
pleases the Master most.

162
00:06:54,390 --> 00:06:56,120
The Master never speaks plainly

163
00:06:56,120 --> 00:06:57,480
nor acts without leaving a way out.

164
00:06:58,040 --> 00:06:59,120
Who else

165
00:06:59,160 --> 00:07:00,390
knows about this matter?

166
00:07:01,600 --> 00:07:02,800
No one else.

167
00:07:06,310 --> 00:07:07,160
A reward for you.

168
00:07:07,680 --> 00:07:08,720
Second Madam,

169
00:07:08,750 --> 00:07:09,920
I seek no reward.

170
00:07:10,560 --> 00:07:11,750
Only a favor.

171
00:07:14,750 --> 00:07:15,630
Ms. Rong,

172
00:07:15,950 --> 00:07:17,360
how could you be so careless?

173
00:07:17,920 --> 00:07:20,360
You've broken my finest bead string.

174
00:07:21,240 --> 00:07:23,270
Hand over all the remaining materials.

175
00:07:23,390 --> 00:07:24,830
The oversight was mine.

176
00:07:24,830 --> 00:07:26,120
I'll accept punishment.

177
00:07:26,390 --> 00:07:29,310
Given your years of service,

178
00:07:29,680 --> 00:07:31,360
I'll let this pass.

179
00:07:31,920 --> 00:07:33,600
Consider it my silent concession.

180
00:07:33,600 --> 00:07:34,750
Thank you, Second Madam.

181
00:07:36,920 --> 00:07:38,070
Madam, please forgive me.

182
00:07:38,070 --> 00:07:39,360
The most precious jade piece

183
00:07:39,360 --> 00:07:40,680
is nowhere to be found.

184
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:43,070
And I dare not search
through others' personal belongings.

185
00:07:43,070 --> 00:07:43,950
With me here,

186
00:07:43,950 --> 00:07:45,190
what are you afraid of?

187
00:07:45,390 --> 00:07:46,120
Find it!

188
00:07:46,830 --> 00:07:47,430
Yes.

189
00:07:52,630 --> 00:07:54,560
Your jade isn't with me.

190
00:07:54,680 --> 00:07:56,950
If you're going to frame someone,
at least do it skillfully.

191
00:07:56,950 --> 00:07:58,310
You misunderstood.

192
00:07:58,750 --> 00:07:59,750
This isn't

193
00:08:00,070 --> 00:08:01,190
about the jade.

194
00:08:13,120 --> 00:08:14,430
There it is, as expected.

195
00:08:19,870 --> 00:08:20,800
Found it.

196
00:08:20,950 --> 00:08:23,270
It must have accidentally
slipped into this bag.

197
00:08:24,040 --> 00:08:25,000
Su Yunqing,

198
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:26,160
don't you dare slander me!

199
00:08:26,160 --> 00:08:27,870
How could your jade possibly be with me?

200
00:08:33,200 --> 00:08:34,720
Datura pollen?

201
00:08:34,750 --> 00:08:36,790
You dare to hide the prohibited drug?

202
00:08:37,480 --> 00:08:38,080
Second Madam,

203
00:08:38,080 --> 00:08:39,000
I didn't!

204
00:08:40,550 --> 00:08:41,630
Second Madam,

205
00:08:41,630 --> 00:08:42,750
please do me justice.

206
00:08:43,200 --> 00:08:45,200
I was drugged and fell unconscious
a few days ago.

207
00:08:45,480 --> 00:08:47,840
Never expected to find
the prohibited drug here.

208
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:48,910
Absurd!

209
00:08:49,030 --> 00:08:50,360
This is outrageous!

210
00:08:50,600 --> 00:08:51,030
It wasn't me!

211
00:08:51,270 --> 00:08:52,480
Liuli, help me!

212
00:08:52,630 --> 00:08:53,080
Liuli!

213
00:08:53,080 --> 00:08:54,200
You're still denying it?

214
00:08:54,200 --> 00:08:54,840
Out of here!

215
00:08:55,240 --> 00:08:55,720
Liuli!

216
00:08:55,720 --> 00:08:56,960
I'll find out where this drug is hidden.

217
00:08:56,960 --> 00:08:57,440
Liuli!

218
00:08:58,000 --> 00:08:58,910
Get out!

219
00:08:59,030 --> 00:08:59,750
Liuli!

220
00:09:00,600 --> 00:09:01,080
Liuli!

221
00:09:01,080 --> 00:09:01,630
Out!

222
00:09:01,630 --> 00:09:02,150
Liuli!

223
00:09:07,240 --> 00:09:08,600
Did you give her the drug?

224
00:09:08,600 --> 00:09:09,480
I was wrong.

225
00:09:09,750 --> 00:09:10,910
I'll never do it again.

226
00:09:13,030 --> 00:09:13,840
Wrong?

227
00:09:14,750 --> 00:09:15,670
What did you do wrong?

228
00:09:15,670 --> 00:09:16,480
Wrong...

229
00:09:17,550 --> 00:09:19,390
Wrong for drugging her.

230
00:09:22,390 --> 00:09:23,080
Ridiculous.

231
00:09:25,120 --> 00:09:26,360
As if the Shen family

232
00:09:26,670 --> 00:09:28,910
couldn't tolerate some prohibited drugs.

233
00:09:31,630 --> 00:09:32,630
But do you realize?

234
00:09:34,840 --> 00:09:36,670
You've given the Second Madam a reason.

235
00:09:37,240 --> 00:09:39,720
A reason to remove my people
from the workshop.

236
00:09:41,630 --> 00:09:43,200
Do you know how much effort I put

237
00:09:43,200 --> 00:09:44,670
into getting Ms. Rong into the workshop?

238
00:09:45,840 --> 00:09:46,750
Now you've ruined everything!

239
00:09:46,750 --> 00:09:47,630
Third Madam, spare me.

240
00:09:47,630 --> 00:09:48,550
Third Madam, please have mercy.

241
00:09:48,550 --> 00:09:49,670
It's my fault.

242
00:09:49,670 --> 00:09:51,270
I'll go explain to the Second Madam now

243
00:09:51,630 --> 00:09:53,150
that this has nothing to do
with Ms. Rong.

244
00:09:55,150 --> 00:09:57,080
What a naive girl.

245
00:09:58,440 --> 00:09:59,600
Drink it.

246
00:10:00,120 --> 00:10:01,360
Spare yourself the physical pain.

247
00:10:13,270 --> 00:10:14,000
You...

248
00:10:16,150 --> 00:10:17,720
Didn't you just leave?

249
00:10:18,150 --> 00:10:19,440
Shouldn't you be in the capital by now?

250
00:10:20,360 --> 00:10:21,440
Do I need to report

251
00:10:21,750 --> 00:10:23,360
my every move to you?

252
00:10:24,550 --> 00:10:25,320
Stop right there.

253
00:10:26,750 --> 00:10:28,200
When you came to help me out last time,

254
00:10:28,200 --> 00:10:29,150
I wondered

255
00:10:29,550 --> 00:10:31,320
why you'd be strolling
around the workshop at midnight.

256
00:10:32,870 --> 00:10:34,240
Then I figured it out.

257
00:10:34,750 --> 00:10:36,790
So you've been secretly observing me.

258
00:10:37,120 --> 00:10:38,200
What do you take me for?

259
00:10:38,270 --> 00:10:39,480
Your plaything?

260
00:10:39,840 --> 00:10:41,030
I saved you

261
00:10:41,670 --> 00:10:42,790
and allowed you to stay

262
00:10:42,790 --> 00:10:44,630
to investigate your sister's case.

263
00:10:46,550 --> 00:10:48,150
Is this how you talk to me?

264
00:10:49,150 --> 00:10:50,480
Who knows if you're helping me

265
00:10:50,480 --> 00:10:51,720
or just using me.

266
00:10:52,390 --> 00:10:53,550
What exactly do you want,

267
00:10:53,550 --> 00:10:54,360
Shen Xingyan?

268
00:10:55,120 --> 00:10:56,600
Where is my sister?

269
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:58,200
Did you lure her

270
00:10:58,200 --> 00:10:59,120
into this nest of vipers

271
00:10:59,120 --> 00:11:00,200
like you did to me,

272
00:11:00,240 --> 00:11:01,750
forcing her to fight for survival?

273
00:11:01,840 --> 00:11:03,240
If you seek something,

274
00:11:03,440 --> 00:11:04,790
you have to contend with both the heaven

275
00:11:04,790 --> 00:11:06,080
and men.

276
00:11:06,270 --> 00:11:07,150
If this displeases you,

277
00:11:07,150 --> 00:11:08,240
you can

278
00:11:09,790 --> 00:11:11,150
leave now.

279
00:11:17,480 --> 00:11:18,720
Tell me where my sister is,

280
00:11:18,840 --> 00:11:19,840
and I'll leave immediately.

281
00:11:21,200 --> 00:11:22,670
The time isn't right.

282
00:11:23,200 --> 00:11:24,200
I can't tell you.

283
00:11:25,240 --> 00:11:26,750
But I want to know now.

284
00:11:29,270 --> 00:11:30,630
With your current abilities,

285
00:11:31,080 --> 00:11:32,240
even if I tell you,

286
00:11:32,240 --> 00:11:33,480
what can you do?

287
00:11:34,600 --> 00:11:36,240
Before tackling the intrigues
of the Shen family,

288
00:11:36,960 --> 00:11:38,750
you'd better become stronger.

289
00:11:38,750 --> 00:11:40,630
If you can enter the main house,

290
00:11:40,670 --> 00:11:41,390
I'll help you.

291
00:11:42,150 --> 00:11:42,870
If not,

292
00:11:43,720 --> 00:11:45,320
no one can help you.

293
00:11:46,480 --> 00:11:47,320
You've

294
00:11:48,360 --> 00:11:49,600
had your chance.

295
00:12:00,750 --> 00:12:01,240
What's wrong?

296
00:12:03,390 --> 00:12:04,030
I won't drink it.

297
00:12:04,030 --> 00:12:04,910
I won't!

298
00:12:05,320 --> 00:12:06,120
Su Yunqing.

299
00:12:08,120 --> 00:12:08,750
Su Yunqing!

300
00:12:08,870 --> 00:12:10,910
I feel like I've become someone else.

301
00:12:11,120 --> 00:12:11,550
Don't test my patience.

302
00:12:11,550 --> 00:12:12,240
No!

303
00:12:12,320 --> 00:12:13,360
Drink it!

304
00:12:13,720 --> 00:12:14,270
Su Yunqing.

305
00:12:14,790 --> 00:12:15,360
Su Yunqing!

306
00:12:15,870 --> 00:12:17,240
They're forcing me to drink poison.

307
00:12:17,240 --> 00:12:17,720
I won't.

308
00:12:17,720 --> 00:12:19,080
Don't be ungrateful!

309
00:12:19,120 --> 00:12:19,670
No!

310
00:12:20,630 --> 00:12:22,150
Drink it!

311
00:12:22,320 --> 00:12:24,120
At least you'll die intact.

312
00:12:24,240 --> 00:12:24,750
Su Yunqing!

313
00:12:24,750 --> 00:12:26,240
Drink it!

314
00:12:26,840 --> 00:12:27,440
Su Yunqing.

315
00:12:27,870 --> 00:12:28,480
Su Yunqing!

316
00:12:28,600 --> 00:12:29,000
Drink!

317
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:29,720
Su Yunqing!

318
00:12:29,870 --> 00:12:30,270
Drink!

319
00:12:31,790 --> 00:12:32,840
Drink up!

320
00:12:34,270 --> 00:12:35,240
Drink it!

321
00:12:36,440 --> 00:12:36,910
Drink!

322
00:12:37,790 --> 00:12:38,600
Liuli?

323
00:12:39,240 --> 00:12:40,320
What's going on?

324
00:12:40,550 --> 00:12:41,960
How did I become Liuli?

325
00:12:42,960 --> 00:12:44,200
I must be dreaming.

326
00:12:45,720 --> 00:12:46,440
What happened?

327
00:12:46,440 --> 00:12:47,150
Don't be ungrateful.

328
00:12:47,150 --> 00:12:48,200
Why is the Third Madam
trying to kill Liuli?

329
00:12:48,200 --> 00:12:49,000
Drink it!

330
00:12:49,320 --> 00:12:50,440
At least you'll die intact.
