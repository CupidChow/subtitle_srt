00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:10,080
[Guilty Maid]
[Episode 20]

2
00:00:17,870 --> 00:00:20,070
The Su family is nothing but trouble.

3
00:00:22,800 --> 00:00:24,390
Because of your family,

4
00:00:25,120 --> 00:00:26,350
I've had to come to this place

5
00:00:26,550 --> 00:00:27,640
more times than I can count.

6
00:00:28,710 --> 00:00:29,960
What wretched luck.

7
00:00:33,670 --> 00:00:34,600
Zhaohua,

8
00:00:35,030 --> 00:00:37,470
now you truly lie dead
in the mass graves.

9
00:00:38,200 --> 00:00:39,750
Fate plays such cruel tricks.

10
00:00:40,790 --> 00:00:43,390
Had I uncovered these truths sooner,

11
00:00:44,070 --> 00:00:45,840
perhaps I could've stopped you

12
00:00:46,790 --> 00:00:49,070
and spared you this grim end.

13
00:00:56,320 --> 00:00:57,110
Wei Xian?

14
00:00:58,350 --> 00:01:00,600
So the Fourth Madam has begun
her covert investigation.

15
00:01:13,790 --> 00:01:15,480
Are you sure it was Wei Xian
who took the body?

16
00:01:16,040 --> 00:01:16,590
Yes.

17
00:01:16,870 --> 00:01:17,920
He was the man falsely accused

18
00:01:17,920 --> 00:01:19,150
of having an affair
with the Fourth Madam.

19
00:01:19,790 --> 00:01:21,840
He must be one
of her trusted confidants.

20
00:01:22,430 --> 00:01:24,400
Seems the Fourth Madam
has many secrets.

21
00:01:25,310 --> 00:01:26,400
Keep watching.

22
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:27,950
Find out

23
00:01:27,950 --> 00:01:30,150
why she took the body.

24
00:01:30,430 --> 00:01:31,040
Understood.

25
00:01:31,480 --> 00:01:32,120
By the way, Mr. Shen,

26
00:01:32,310 --> 00:01:33,310
I heard

27
00:01:33,590 --> 00:01:35,510
the First Madam had nothing to do
with the Master's death.

28
00:01:36,040 --> 00:01:37,950
She'll soon be acquitted and released.

29
00:01:38,400 --> 00:01:40,840
You spread news of the Master's death,

30
00:01:40,840 --> 00:01:42,640
leading to her imprisonment.

31
00:01:42,870 --> 00:01:43,760
I fear

32
00:01:43,950 --> 00:01:46,430
she may seek revenge upon her return.

33
00:01:47,200 --> 00:01:48,200
The First Madam

34
00:01:48,230 --> 00:01:49,640
was the prime suspect
in my father's death.

35
00:01:49,680 --> 00:01:51,070
Of course I had to
investigate thoroughly.

36
00:01:51,510 --> 00:01:52,710
Even without this,

37
00:01:53,070 --> 00:01:54,510
she would have found a way
to undermine me.

38
00:01:55,400 --> 00:01:56,040
But

39
00:01:56,590 --> 00:01:58,590
I'm not her primary target.

40
00:01:59,280 --> 00:02:00,920
No need to worry about it for now.

41
00:02:01,760 --> 00:02:02,310
Then

42
00:02:02,760 --> 00:02:03,510
Su Yunqing?

43
00:02:03,640 --> 00:02:04,480
Hold the search for now.

44
00:02:05,150 --> 00:02:06,480
I already know where she is.

45
00:02:38,120 --> 00:02:39,710
Why are you suddenly

46
00:02:39,710 --> 00:02:40,680
burning paper offerings?

47
00:02:42,120 --> 00:02:43,150
Mr. Shen,

48
00:02:43,870 --> 00:02:46,120
I recently lost a family member.

49
00:02:48,240 --> 00:02:49,000
What a coincidence.

50
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:52,630
What did you need me for?

51
00:02:54,080 --> 00:02:55,190
Come with me to the room.

52
00:02:55,470 --> 00:02:56,710
I have questions for you.

53
00:02:59,430 --> 00:03:00,470
About what?

54
00:03:05,840 --> 00:03:07,280
This is no place for details.

55
00:03:08,470 --> 00:03:09,960
Just speak here.

56
00:03:15,360 --> 00:03:17,080
Shen Xingyan, put me down!

57
00:03:17,240 --> 00:03:19,120
Let me go!

58
00:03:19,630 --> 00:03:20,840
Shen Xingyan!

59
00:03:20,840 --> 00:03:21,430
Let go of me!

60
00:03:22,190 --> 00:03:24,400
What do you want, Shen Xingyan?

61
00:03:25,470 --> 00:03:26,960
Aren't you carrying my child?

62
00:03:27,710 --> 00:03:29,030
Why so distant?

63
00:03:29,030 --> 00:03:29,470
I...

64
00:03:30,120 --> 00:03:31,710
Qiuyue once bribed the physician

65
00:03:32,150 --> 00:03:33,430
to fake her pregnancy.

66
00:03:33,870 --> 00:03:35,310
If you were truly her,

67
00:03:36,190 --> 00:03:37,400
how could you not know?

68
00:03:38,360 --> 00:03:39,280
It was because Qiuyue uncovered

69
00:03:39,280 --> 00:03:40,560
Su Yunqing's secret

70
00:03:41,470 --> 00:03:44,000
that I was forced
to cast aside my beloved.

71
00:03:44,400 --> 00:03:45,590
Whether it was Zhou Furong

72
00:03:45,800 --> 00:03:46,840
or Qiuyue,

73
00:03:47,240 --> 00:03:49,430
they were merely facades.

74
00:03:50,310 --> 00:03:52,280
There has only ever been

75
00:03:52,840 --> 00:03:54,560
one person in my heart.

76
00:03:57,280 --> 00:03:58,080
Su Yunqing,

77
00:04:00,470 --> 00:04:02,360
how much longer will you
hide it from me?

78
00:04:19,430 --> 00:04:20,430
I knew

79
00:04:21,270 --> 00:04:22,950
no matter what I become,

80
00:04:23,630 --> 00:04:25,160
you'd always find me.

81
00:05:33,420 --> 00:05:35,100
Qiuyue deceived the First Madam,

82
00:05:35,100 --> 00:05:36,540
pretending to be pregnant

83
00:05:36,860 --> 00:05:38,340
to save herself.

84
00:05:39,100 --> 00:05:40,780
Now the First Madam has returned.

85
00:05:41,700 --> 00:05:43,500
She will surely pin her hopes on that.

86
00:05:46,380 --> 00:05:47,980
You must protect yourself.

87
00:05:48,340 --> 00:05:50,140
I can't bear to lose you again.

88
00:05:56,580 --> 00:05:57,500
The Shen family

89
00:05:58,380 --> 00:05:59,620
is about to face a storm.

90
00:06:02,140 --> 00:06:05,060
[Shen Mansion]

91
00:06:05,060 --> 00:06:06,980
I hear that the moment I left,

92
00:06:08,100 --> 00:06:10,980
someone was already
eyeing my position?

93
00:06:12,820 --> 00:06:13,780
First Madam, you jest.

94
00:06:13,780 --> 00:06:14,780
Did I permit you to speak?

95
00:06:16,380 --> 00:06:17,420
Don't forget,

96
00:06:17,540 --> 00:06:19,060
you are all mere concubines.

97
00:06:19,060 --> 00:06:20,820
The Master may be gone,

98
00:06:21,020 --> 00:06:22,660
but the Shen family

99
00:06:22,900 --> 00:06:24,700
still answers to me.

100
00:06:24,980 --> 00:06:26,460
You will kneel

101
00:06:26,660 --> 00:06:28,860
when I command it.

102
00:06:35,460 --> 00:06:37,940
Do you know why

103
00:06:37,940 --> 00:06:39,380
they released me?

104
00:06:39,380 --> 00:06:40,740
Innocence speaks for itself.

105
00:06:40,740 --> 00:06:41,980
You didn't do it.

106
00:06:42,500 --> 00:06:44,340
Of course they found no evidence.

107
00:06:44,340 --> 00:06:44,860
Exactly.

108
00:06:45,700 --> 00:06:46,460
The Master

109
00:06:46,860 --> 00:06:48,380
wasn't drowned.

110
00:06:48,700 --> 00:06:49,500
But

111
00:06:49,740 --> 00:06:51,380
his death wasn't my doing.

112
00:06:51,740 --> 00:06:53,740
When I found his body,

113
00:06:53,900 --> 00:06:55,420
I concealed his death

114
00:06:55,420 --> 00:06:56,660
to protect the Shen family.

115
00:06:56,940 --> 00:06:59,460
I secretly transported his body away.

116
00:07:00,300 --> 00:07:02,180
The coroner confirmed

117
00:07:03,140 --> 00:07:05,020
he had been dead for seven days

118
00:07:05,700 --> 00:07:07,300
and was killed with a single fatal blow.

119
00:07:07,660 --> 00:07:09,740
Clearly, someone murdered him,

120
00:07:09,980 --> 00:07:11,380
then dumped his body in my courtyard

121
00:07:11,380 --> 00:07:12,980
to frame me

122
00:07:13,140 --> 00:07:16,380
so as to become the lady of the house.

123
00:07:16,380 --> 00:07:17,060
First Madam,

124
00:07:17,260 --> 00:07:18,460
you misunderstood.

125
00:07:18,460 --> 00:07:21,660
I took on the role
to help you manage things

126
00:07:21,660 --> 00:07:22,940
and prevent any mishaps.

127
00:07:23,300 --> 00:07:24,980
Prevent mishaps?

128
00:07:25,780 --> 00:07:27,140
Look at the mess you've made

129
00:07:27,580 --> 00:07:29,420
while I was away.

130
00:07:30,060 --> 00:07:31,460
A mere Su Zhaohua

131
00:07:31,500 --> 00:07:33,380
was enough to throw you into disarray.

132
00:07:33,380 --> 00:07:35,140
You can't even handle
such trivial matters.

133
00:07:35,540 --> 00:07:38,140
I don't think you have the guts
to kill the Master.

134
00:07:38,460 --> 00:07:39,580
You're absolutely right.

135
00:07:46,500 --> 00:07:47,460
First Madam,

136
00:07:47,860 --> 00:07:48,900
this began

137
00:07:49,100 --> 00:07:50,740
when someone left a secret account book

138
00:07:50,740 --> 00:07:51,500
at my mother's doorstep.

139
00:07:52,060 --> 00:07:53,660
With Qiuyue's help,

140
00:07:53,660 --> 00:07:54,980
we uncovered that someone
in the Shen family

141
00:07:55,340 --> 00:07:56,860
colluded with Su Zhaohua

142
00:07:56,860 --> 00:07:58,580
to embezzle workshop funds
for private loans.

143
00:07:59,140 --> 00:08:00,580
I called Su Zhaohua here

144
00:08:01,220 --> 00:08:03,060
to coax out who in the Shen family

145
00:08:03,260 --> 00:08:05,340
was her accomplice.

146
00:08:05,740 --> 00:08:06,900
Never did I expect

147
00:08:07,100 --> 00:08:08,860
such a turn of events.

148
00:08:08,900 --> 00:08:11,620
Qiuyue is just a maid.

149
00:08:12,020 --> 00:08:13,980
How could she possibly
understand the accounts?

150
00:08:14,140 --> 00:08:14,820
If you ask me,

151
00:08:15,260 --> 00:08:16,220
someone behind Qiuyue

152
00:08:16,220 --> 00:08:17,460
is probably

153
00:08:17,580 --> 00:08:19,660
using the secret accounts

154
00:08:20,180 --> 00:08:21,500
to sow discord.

155
00:08:23,060 --> 00:08:24,380
The Third Madam

156
00:08:25,580 --> 00:08:26,740
makes a valid point.

157
00:08:28,260 --> 00:08:29,060
Xingyan,

158
00:08:29,540 --> 00:08:31,300
bring me those account books

159
00:08:31,300 --> 00:08:32,580
for review.

160
00:08:33,860 --> 00:08:34,980
Third Madam,

161
00:08:34,980 --> 00:08:37,860
you're relieved of workshop oversight
from now on.

162
00:08:37,980 --> 00:08:39,260
Before everything is cleared up,

163
00:08:39,260 --> 00:08:40,900
all the payment transactions

164
00:08:41,020 --> 00:08:42,380
should be reviewed by me.

165
00:08:42,660 --> 00:08:43,380
First Madam, but...

166
00:08:43,380 --> 00:08:44,060
What's the matter?

167
00:08:46,180 --> 00:08:46,900
Understood.

168
00:08:52,660 --> 00:08:53,300
First Madam,

169
00:08:53,300 --> 00:08:53,940
disaster.

170
00:08:54,020 --> 00:08:55,260
Qiuyue has been kidnapped.

171
00:08:55,260 --> 00:08:56,620
The kidnapper is highly skilled.

172
00:08:56,620 --> 00:08:58,820
Even a dozen of us couldn't stop him.

173
00:09:00,300 --> 00:09:01,220
To kidnap someone

174
00:09:01,220 --> 00:09:02,340
from the Shen family in broad daylight?

175
00:09:02,380 --> 00:09:03,220
Su Yunqing.

176
00:09:03,260 --> 00:09:05,020
They simply show no respect for us.

177
00:09:05,300 --> 00:09:05,940
Xingyan!

178
00:09:26,860 --> 00:09:27,700
Who are you?

179
00:09:27,860 --> 00:09:29,180
Why did you bring me here?

180
00:09:35,820 --> 00:09:36,900
It's you.

181
00:09:37,980 --> 00:09:39,020
You know me?

182
00:09:40,100 --> 00:09:40,820
No.

183
00:09:43,620 --> 00:09:45,460
Last time, it's the First Madam

184
00:09:45,780 --> 00:09:47,580
who framed me for adultery.

185
00:09:48,220 --> 00:09:49,260
Is she

186
00:09:49,620 --> 00:09:51,460
after me again now?

187
00:09:52,500 --> 00:09:53,900
But why?

188
00:09:56,580 --> 00:09:57,220
Why...

189
00:09:57,220 --> 00:09:58,420
Why did you kidnap me?

190
00:09:58,420 --> 00:10:00,340
I'm highly favored by the First Madam.

191
00:10:00,700 --> 00:10:01,980
I think you've got the wrong person.

192
00:10:01,980 --> 00:10:03,060
You'd better shut your mouth!

193
00:10:03,460 --> 00:10:04,340
Otherwise,

194
00:10:04,940 --> 00:10:06,580
if anger me,

195
00:10:06,780 --> 00:10:08,220
you'll regret it.

196
00:10:13,460 --> 00:10:14,180
Ms. Liu.

197
00:10:14,180 --> 00:10:14,900
Hurry.

198
00:10:15,380 --> 00:10:16,980
Why have you tied her up?

199
00:10:16,980 --> 00:10:18,060
With your skills,

200
00:10:18,100 --> 00:10:19,540
are you afraid she'll escape?

201
00:10:19,620 --> 00:10:20,780
I don't want complications.

202
00:10:22,820 --> 00:10:23,340
Ms. Liu,

203
00:10:23,620 --> 00:10:24,140
hurry.

204
00:10:24,140 --> 00:10:25,500
Go get her something to eat.

205
00:10:25,500 --> 00:10:27,940
We don't want to starve her baby.

206
00:10:28,740 --> 00:10:29,340
Water.

207
00:10:33,740 --> 00:10:34,180
Here.

208
00:10:34,180 --> 00:10:34,980
Have some water.

209
00:10:44,220 --> 00:10:45,780
If you want the baby,

210
00:10:45,780 --> 00:10:47,420
then why kidnap me?

211
00:10:48,820 --> 00:10:50,300
Someone wants you dead.

212
00:10:50,300 --> 00:10:52,380
I took you to protect you.

213
00:10:52,660 --> 00:10:54,900
You should thank the child
you're carrying.

214
00:10:54,900 --> 00:10:56,100
Without it,

215
00:10:56,100 --> 00:10:58,060
your life wouldn't be worth this much.

216
00:10:58,860 --> 00:10:59,580
Ms. Liu,

217
00:10:59,900 --> 00:11:01,260
examine her.

218
00:11:05,460 --> 00:11:06,180
Ms. Liu.

219
00:11:06,820 --> 00:11:07,620
Where is she?

220
00:11:09,900 --> 00:11:10,700
Ms. Liu?

221
00:11:14,820 --> 00:11:15,420
Ms. Liu...

222
00:11:20,300 --> 00:11:22,380
Madam, where are you going?

223
00:11:26,620 --> 00:11:27,300
You...
