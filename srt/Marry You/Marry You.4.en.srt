FILMING FOR CHILD ACTORS TOOK PLACE
UNDER BROADCASTING GUIDELINES

3
00:00:40,790 --> 00:00:44,210
Firstly,
he stands out with his unique looks.

4
00:00:44,294 --> 00:00:46,421
He'd be great for promotional purposes.

5
00:00:47,130 --> 00:00:50,592
The market became quite slow recently…

6
00:01:00,435 --> 00:01:02,729
Suspicion leads to misunderstanding.

7
00:01:03,646 --> 00:01:05,523
And when misunderstandings
start piling up,

8
00:01:07,776 --> 00:01:09,611
they ruin a well-built foundation,

9
00:01:10,820 --> 00:01:12,530
and the trust is lost.

10
00:01:13,490 --> 00:01:16,326
And relationships are completely ruined.

11
00:01:16,409 --> 00:01:17,577
That's how we expect it.

12
00:01:18,244 --> 00:01:20,663
In conclusion, Bong Cheol-hui became

13
00:01:20,747 --> 00:01:25,001
the first ambassador of
Marriage Morale Boost Project.

14
00:01:25,668 --> 00:01:28,588
He got some attention
on Instagram recently too.

15
00:01:29,172 --> 00:01:31,382
And he is our mayor's favorite.

16
00:01:33,593 --> 00:01:36,554
Ms. Jeong, is the poster
photo shoot today?

17
00:01:44,187 --> 00:01:45,188
Ms. Jeong?

18
00:01:48,942 --> 00:01:50,693
Oh, yes.

19
00:01:52,862 --> 00:01:54,239
Is something wrong, Ms. Jeong?

20
00:01:55,198 --> 00:01:56,574
Nothing's wrong.

21
00:01:58,952 --> 00:02:02,288
Yes. Well, if you'll take a look at this…

22
00:02:18,763 --> 00:02:19,889
Darn it.

23
00:02:21,975 --> 00:02:23,309
Oh, no!

24
00:02:35,905 --> 00:02:38,908
There are no applicants. Oh, no.

25
00:02:41,703 --> 00:02:44,247
There are no applicants, right. Oh, no.

26
00:02:44,330 --> 00:02:46,499
What to do? We'll figure something out.

27
00:02:58,303 --> 00:02:59,762
Oh, come in.

28
00:03:05,894 --> 00:03:08,479
This is Na Ji-won,
an intern who is joining us.

29
00:03:09,230 --> 00:03:10,732
An intern?

30
00:03:10,815 --> 00:03:12,066
She looks familiar.

31
00:03:12,984 --> 00:03:14,485
That applicant from last time?

32
00:03:15,945 --> 00:03:17,906
Yes, I applied.

33
00:03:17,989 --> 00:03:20,199
They were hiring
a university student intern.

34
00:03:21,951 --> 00:03:24,996
The mayor has high hopes
for the Marriage Morale Boost Team.

35
00:03:25,079 --> 00:03:28,374
We'll get busier with more applicants
in the future,

36
00:03:29,125 --> 00:03:31,127
so he added an intern
to our team in advance.

37
00:03:31,210 --> 00:03:33,463
Mr. Han, teach her well.

38
00:03:33,546 --> 00:03:34,964
Yes, sir.

39
00:03:35,548 --> 00:03:37,342
- Take a seat over there.
- Okay.

40
00:03:41,763 --> 00:03:44,849
As for there being
no online applicants at all,

41
00:03:44,933 --> 00:03:47,352
I believe it will get better
once the poster is out

42
00:03:47,435 --> 00:03:49,479
and we start promoting in earnest.

43
00:03:50,438 --> 00:03:51,522
It's strange.

44
00:03:51,606 --> 00:03:53,691
I think we had at least one or two before.

45
00:03:54,984 --> 00:03:58,488
We do get phone inquiries regularly.

46
00:03:59,072 --> 00:04:00,240
It's like buying a ticket.

47
00:04:02,909 --> 00:04:05,870
How dare you,
when the team leader is talking?

48
00:04:05,954 --> 00:04:07,580
Don't cut in like that.

49
00:04:07,664 --> 00:04:08,706
Buying a ticket?

50
00:04:08,790 --> 00:04:11,459
Yes, as in buying a concert ticket.

51
00:04:11,542 --> 00:04:14,212
I used to work part-time at TicketLand.

52
00:04:14,295 --> 00:04:17,048
When the site went down,
they'd call us to buy the tickets

53
00:04:18,258 --> 00:04:19,425
since they couldn't online.

54
00:04:21,010 --> 00:04:23,763
Mr. Han, is the site working fine?

55
00:04:25,223 --> 00:04:26,349
Give me a moment.

56
00:04:26,849 --> 00:04:28,893
MARRIAGE MORALE BOOST PROJECT

ERROR UPLOADING

58
00:04:35,191 --> 00:04:37,735
I really can't apply online, Mr. Choi.

59
00:04:38,695 --> 00:04:40,738
The one in charge of the site is Mr. Yang.

60
00:04:40,822 --> 00:04:42,532
Yes, it's me.

61
00:04:42,615 --> 00:04:43,950
Contact the site provider.

62
00:04:44,701 --> 00:04:45,702
Yes, sir.

63
00:04:46,703 --> 00:04:48,246
Just a moment, please.

64
00:04:48,830 --> 00:04:49,872
The number was…

65
00:04:57,088 --> 00:04:59,382
Which page…

66
00:05:02,302 --> 00:05:05,263
- Gosh, change your notebook, Mr. Yang.
- You startled me.

67
00:05:05,346 --> 00:05:07,765
It's practically decomposed.

68
00:05:08,599 --> 00:05:12,937
Who writes down phone numbers
in a notebook nowadays?

69
00:05:13,021 --> 00:05:15,523
Be quiet, will you?

70
00:05:15,606 --> 00:05:17,191
You're distracting me.

71
00:05:18,067 --> 00:05:19,110
Let's see.

72
00:05:31,789 --> 00:05:34,792
The number you called doesn't exist.

73
00:05:34,876 --> 00:05:37,211
Check the number and try again.

74
00:05:44,844 --> 00:05:47,680
They're not picking up.

75
00:05:47,764 --> 00:05:50,516
I'll call them again later.

76
00:05:50,600 --> 00:05:53,227
Okay. Then, Mr. Yang,
get in touch with the provider

77
00:05:53,311 --> 00:05:54,896
and get the site restored by today.

78
00:05:57,106 --> 00:06:00,735
I'm going to the mayor's office.

79
00:06:07,283 --> 00:06:10,244
This is terrible. What should I do?

80
00:06:11,954 --> 00:06:13,289
What's wrong, Mr. Yang?

81
00:06:14,957 --> 00:06:18,002
- The number doesn't exist.
- What? It doesn't exist?

82
00:06:18,086 --> 00:06:20,797
The number of the website provider
doesn't exist.

83
00:06:20,880 --> 00:06:21,839
What?

84
00:06:21,923 --> 00:06:24,258
Did the provider go out of business?

85
00:06:25,384 --> 00:06:28,221
I'll be disciplined if this gets reported.

86
00:06:28,304 --> 00:06:30,348
Just this one time,

87
00:06:30,431 --> 00:06:34,977
can we settle it ourselves
so Mr. Choi doesn't know?

88
00:06:36,187 --> 00:06:37,021
Please?

89
00:06:41,651 --> 00:06:42,485
Let's try.

90
00:06:44,570 --> 00:06:46,864
We just need to restore it by today.

91
00:06:47,448 --> 00:06:48,616
That's right.

92
00:06:48,699 --> 00:06:50,201
You sure are loyal, Ms. Jeong.

93
00:06:51,202 --> 00:06:54,872
Mr. Yang, go to their office
and check if they really went under.

94
00:06:54,956 --> 00:06:55,957
I got it.

95
00:06:56,040 --> 00:06:59,585
- We'll reach out to other providers.
- Okay.

96
00:06:59,669 --> 00:07:01,963
- Mr. Han, can you be in charge?
- Okay.

97
00:07:02,046 --> 00:07:04,715
Ms. Lee, answer the phone inquiries.

98
00:07:05,800 --> 00:07:08,511
Then what about you, Ms. Jeong?

99
00:07:10,805 --> 00:07:12,056
For me…

100
00:07:29,073 --> 00:07:30,116
By the way,

101
00:07:31,993 --> 00:07:35,455
do I have to go with you?

102
00:07:35,538 --> 00:07:38,833
Of course. This is
for our first promotional poster.

103
00:07:41,085 --> 00:07:43,212
Cheol-hui doesn't make you uncomfortable,
does he?

104
00:07:45,006 --> 00:07:47,842
No, that's not it.

105
00:07:50,011 --> 00:07:52,138
He doesn't exactly make me
comfortable either.

106
00:07:53,389 --> 00:07:54,682
Shall we go then?

107
00:08:46,275 --> 00:08:47,610
How have you been?

108
00:08:48,110 --> 00:08:49,153
Have a seat.

109
00:08:57,036 --> 00:08:59,497
You must've known I was waiting for you.

110
00:09:03,543 --> 00:09:05,002
How heedless of you.

111
00:09:07,088 --> 00:09:08,714
Coming here

112
00:09:10,341 --> 00:09:11,717
was hard for me.

113
00:09:14,595 --> 00:09:16,138
Is it because you're afraid…

114
00:09:19,183 --> 00:09:22,478
of being reminded of that day
if you see me?

115
00:09:26,315 --> 00:09:32,196
Still, shouldn't I do my duty
for his sake?

116
00:09:35,074 --> 00:09:37,034
You shouldn't concern yourself.

117
00:09:38,494 --> 00:09:41,372
It's a memory I should handle myself.

118
00:09:42,039 --> 00:09:45,042
When I read the article
on your marriage project,

119
00:09:45,126 --> 00:09:46,919
I was secretly glad.

120
00:09:48,379 --> 00:09:50,840
Also the fact that you left the island.

121
00:09:53,551 --> 00:09:58,389
Someone helped me make up my mind.

122
00:10:00,016 --> 00:10:03,144
So you don't have to worry about me now.

123
00:10:06,731 --> 00:10:08,649
If you need my help,

124
00:10:08,733 --> 00:10:11,402
do not hesitate to call me anytime, okay?

125
00:10:15,615 --> 00:10:16,574
Thank you.

126
00:10:18,034 --> 00:10:21,454
Take good care of yourself too, sir.

127
00:10:33,466 --> 00:10:34,300
My gosh.

128
00:10:37,428 --> 00:10:38,554
Nice to meet you.

129
00:10:39,180 --> 00:10:40,640
Hi, nice to meet you too.

130
00:10:41,891 --> 00:10:43,768
My gosh, you're incredible.

131
00:10:43,851 --> 00:10:46,979
I'm being challenged
for the first time in a while.

132
00:10:47,063 --> 00:10:49,148
Dear, just trust me.

133
00:10:49,231 --> 00:10:51,984
We'll tear it up today.

134
00:10:54,612 --> 00:10:55,821
Hae-rin.

135
00:10:57,073 --> 00:10:58,115
Hae-rin!

136
00:10:59,950 --> 00:11:00,951
What's with him?

137
00:11:04,330 --> 00:11:06,165
They haven't started the photo shoot yet.

138
00:11:06,999 --> 00:11:07,833
You're right.

139
00:11:09,418 --> 00:11:11,170
Where is Cheol-hui?

140
00:11:15,841 --> 00:11:16,926
Excuse me for a bit.

141
00:11:18,511 --> 00:11:19,929
Where are you going?

142
00:11:21,597 --> 00:11:23,891

MR. YANG

144
00:11:31,690 --> 00:11:32,608
Hello, Mr. Yang.

145
00:11:34,110 --> 00:11:36,695
This is bad. They really shut down.

146
00:11:36,779 --> 00:11:38,447
What? They shut down?

147
00:11:40,741 --> 00:11:43,077
Please look for a company to replace them.

148
00:11:43,160 --> 00:11:45,996
I'll leave it to you, Mr. Han.

149
00:11:50,209 --> 00:11:51,252
What is it?

150
00:11:51,335 --> 00:11:54,672
It was Mr. Yang.
The website provider shut down.

151
00:11:54,755 --> 00:11:57,341
What? That's nonsense.

152
00:11:57,425 --> 00:12:00,761
Goodness, this isn't a small matter.
This is a serious matter.

153
00:12:03,305 --> 00:12:06,767
I know of a developer.
Would you like to meet him?

154
00:12:06,851 --> 00:12:09,520
Who is that?

155
00:12:10,646 --> 00:12:12,773
My uncle is a developer.

156
00:12:27,246 --> 00:12:29,540
- As expected of Lonely Boy.
- How did he debug that?

157
00:12:29,623 --> 00:12:32,042
- Lonely Boy is amazing!
- I came to worship you again.

158
00:12:38,966 --> 00:12:41,469
Take your time and get changed.
Watch out for your head.

159
00:12:42,094 --> 00:12:43,345
I'll be back soon.

160
00:12:45,306 --> 00:12:47,683
I feel like I'm back to my rookie days.

161
00:12:47,766 --> 00:12:49,602
- Hello.
- Hello.

162
00:12:49,685 --> 00:12:51,103
Hae-rin!

163
00:13:15,878 --> 00:13:18,130
Emergency. The website provider shut down!

164
00:13:19,715 --> 00:13:22,885
Ji-won's uncle is a developer.
Should we try to recruit him?

165
00:13:24,845 --> 00:13:26,805
I'm for it. Contact him quickly.

166
00:13:27,806 --> 00:13:30,309
Ji-won, let's go together now!

167
00:13:43,989 --> 00:13:45,366
Cheol-hui.

168
00:13:45,449 --> 00:13:48,035
Ha-na, you're full of riddles.

169
00:13:48,786 --> 00:13:50,412
You have a strange hobby too.

170
00:13:51,080 --> 00:13:53,082
No, that's not it.

171
00:13:53,165 --> 00:13:54,208
Interested in my body?

172
00:13:54,792 --> 00:13:58,045
Tell me. Which part of my body
are you interested in?

173
00:13:58,712 --> 00:13:59,713
It's nothing.

174
00:13:59,797 --> 00:14:02,591
The staff is waiting,
so finish getting ready quickly.

175
00:14:20,526 --> 00:14:21,360
Uncle!

176
00:14:21,944 --> 00:14:23,195
I know you're in there.

177
00:14:23,279 --> 00:14:25,698
Open the door, Uncle!

178
00:14:26,907 --> 00:14:28,617
Mr. Developer.

179
00:14:29,493 --> 00:14:30,494
Mr…

180
00:14:31,412 --> 00:14:32,997
What should we do?

181
00:14:33,080 --> 00:14:34,665
What is it?

182
00:14:37,585 --> 00:14:40,588
Our website has an error.

183
00:14:40,671 --> 00:14:42,965
You're the only person who can fix it.

184
00:14:44,550 --> 00:14:47,636
We must get it done by today.

185
00:14:47,720 --> 00:14:49,555
Please help us.

186
00:14:54,435 --> 00:14:56,270
It's past my work hours.
Come back tomorrow.

187
00:14:59,815 --> 00:15:00,816
Uncle!

188
00:15:01,609 --> 00:15:05,029
What does your uncle like?

189
00:15:05,779 --> 00:15:08,824
It seems like we need some bait.

190
00:15:08,908 --> 00:15:10,451
- Bait?
- Yes.

191
00:15:11,243 --> 00:15:12,620
Oh, right.

192
00:15:13,162 --> 00:15:17,458
Uncle. You know the customized keyboard
my dad bought for me last time?

193
00:15:17,541 --> 00:15:19,293
I'll give it to you.

194
00:15:19,376 --> 00:15:22,254
There are only two of them
in the world, you know?

195
00:15:22,338 --> 00:15:25,215
So please help us, Uncle.

196
00:15:25,299 --> 00:15:26,467
Uncle.

197
00:15:29,887 --> 00:15:31,639
RECLUSE UNCLE

198
00:15:31,722 --> 00:15:32,848
Deal.

199
00:15:37,353 --> 00:15:38,729
Gosh, you startled me.

200
00:15:38,812 --> 00:15:40,147
Thank you.

201
00:15:40,940 --> 00:15:42,775
- He's here.
- Where?

202
00:15:43,859 --> 00:15:44,902
That car.

203
00:16:02,586 --> 00:16:03,837
Location?

204
00:16:06,382 --> 00:16:10,302
Injeong City Hall,
Marriage Morale Boost Team.

205
00:16:13,305 --> 00:16:14,515
What?

206
00:16:22,523 --> 00:16:23,983
Your uncle is single, isn't he?

207
00:16:27,152 --> 00:16:28,654
Poor man.

208
00:16:32,533 --> 00:16:34,451
You seem to have a lot on your mind today.

209
00:16:34,535 --> 00:16:35,411
Pardon?

210
00:16:38,455 --> 00:16:40,749
Are you worried about something?

211
00:16:41,750 --> 00:16:45,421
It's more about distrust than worry.

212
00:16:47,006 --> 00:16:48,257
Distrust?

213
00:16:50,175 --> 00:16:53,804
Now that I suddenly started
to find him suspicious,

214
00:16:53,887 --> 00:16:55,681
it is spiraling out of hand.

215
00:17:00,477 --> 00:17:02,896
Here comes the model.

216
00:17:45,522 --> 00:17:49,568
Well, do I look okay?

217
00:17:51,987 --> 00:17:52,905
- Ha-na?
- Yes?

218
00:17:54,031 --> 00:17:55,616
Do I look okay?

219
00:17:56,116 --> 00:17:59,661
Yes. You look more than okay.

220
00:17:59,745 --> 00:18:00,954
I don't know if this fits.

221
00:18:01,038 --> 00:18:03,999
This thing is choking me,
and the shoes are hard.

222
00:18:04,083 --> 00:18:06,543
It's very uncomfortable.

223
00:18:06,627 --> 00:18:08,629
Cheol-hui, you look very cool.

224
00:18:08,712 --> 00:18:11,381
Have some confidence,
and let's start the photo shoot.

225
00:18:13,467 --> 00:18:16,720
Okay, Cheol-hui. Stand however you like.

226
00:18:16,804 --> 00:18:18,764
Look over there.

227
00:18:19,431 --> 00:18:20,724
Cheol-hui.

228
00:18:21,350 --> 00:18:23,393
You still look a bit nervous.

229
00:18:23,477 --> 00:18:25,437
Try striking this pose.

230
00:18:25,521 --> 00:18:28,398
Imagine you're pulling
your wife's hand like this.

231
00:18:31,568 --> 00:18:32,528
That's it.

232
00:18:32,611 --> 00:18:36,198
That's it. A bit more like this.
Stand more comfortably.

233
00:18:36,281 --> 00:18:37,533
And put on a nice face.

234
00:18:39,368 --> 00:18:41,703
Smile romantically.

235
00:18:41,787 --> 00:18:43,747
Straighten your back. Balance yourself.

236
00:18:45,457 --> 00:18:47,376
Be more emotional.

237
00:18:47,459 --> 00:18:51,130
Well, sir, I don't have any experience.

238
00:18:51,213 --> 00:18:56,135
It's hard to do this alone
without anyone actually in front of me.

239
00:18:56,218 --> 00:18:58,262
Okay. Then, let's see…

240
00:18:59,388 --> 00:19:01,682
Oh, the lady here can help.

241
00:19:01,765 --> 00:19:04,351
What? Me?

242
00:19:04,434 --> 00:19:06,353
Yes. Help us out.

243
00:19:07,813 --> 00:19:10,023
Ha-na, are you okay with it?

244
00:19:15,946 --> 00:19:17,364
I'll help.

245
00:19:25,038 --> 00:19:26,456
I can help too, right?

246
00:19:26,540 --> 00:19:28,876
Whoever is helping him
won't be in the photo anyway.

247
00:19:30,043 --> 00:19:31,211
Please take my jacket.

248
00:19:33,380 --> 00:19:34,298
But…

249
00:19:36,091 --> 00:19:38,010
- Are you serious?
- Yes.

250
00:19:40,721 --> 00:19:42,723
- Like this?
- That's right.

251
00:19:43,724 --> 00:19:45,851
If you're ready, let's continue.

252
00:19:50,772 --> 00:19:51,607
What…

253
00:19:53,609 --> 00:19:55,027
What are you doing?

254
00:19:55,110 --> 00:19:57,029
If we're doing it, we should go all out.

255
00:20:02,117 --> 00:20:04,578
Photographer, we're ready. Let's start.

256
00:20:04,661 --> 00:20:06,788
Okay. It looks great!

257
00:20:07,372 --> 00:20:10,334
Stay there. One, two, three.

258
00:20:12,836 --> 00:20:15,464
- What about this?
- That looks nice. One, two, three.

259
00:20:17,257 --> 00:20:18,467
Okay.

260
00:20:19,635 --> 00:20:22,471
That's nice too. One, two, three.

261
00:20:38,445 --> 00:20:41,406
Are you Ji-won's uncle?

262
00:20:43,951 --> 00:20:45,327
Are you the developer?

263
00:20:46,912 --> 00:20:47,829
Yes.

264
00:20:52,709 --> 00:20:54,336
He is my uncle.

265
00:20:54,419 --> 00:20:57,881
As you can see, he's an extreme introvert.
He is very shy.

266
00:20:58,423 --> 00:21:02,177
But is he really a competent developer?

267
00:21:02,761 --> 00:21:03,720
You'll see.

268
00:21:06,431 --> 00:21:08,016
I heard our savior was here.

269
00:21:08,100 --> 00:21:10,060
Goodness, sir. It's nice to meet you.

270
00:21:10,143 --> 00:21:11,645
I look forward to your work.

271
00:21:13,188 --> 00:21:16,275
- Where is Mr. Choi?
- Still at the poster shooting set.

272
00:21:16,358 --> 00:21:18,735
But it should be ending soon.

273
00:21:19,403 --> 00:21:20,946
We don't have time. Let's hurry.

274
00:21:21,029 --> 00:21:24,116
- Hurry.
- Okay. Mr. Savior, this way.

275
00:21:35,252 --> 00:21:38,755
This is the sign-up page of our project.

276
00:21:38,839 --> 00:21:43,135
The project sign-up option is deactivated.

277
00:21:47,139 --> 00:21:48,974
I checked the source,

278
00:21:49,057 --> 00:21:51,727
and the sign-up button leads
to another route.

279
00:21:52,436 --> 00:21:55,689
Someone is stealing
the information from your server.

280
00:21:55,772 --> 00:21:58,317
In other words, it has to be
reverted, merged to master,

281
00:21:58,400 --> 00:22:00,319
and deployed.

282
00:22:01,486 --> 00:22:04,614
I need to check further
for more details, but…

283
00:22:14,833 --> 00:22:18,170
I'm saying it can be fixed today.

284
00:22:20,464 --> 00:22:22,924
Thank you so much, sir.

285
00:22:28,221 --> 00:22:31,683
MARRIAGE MORALE BOOST PROJECT

286
00:22:32,267 --> 00:22:33,268
How about this?

287
00:22:34,436 --> 00:22:37,397
It looks fine.
What do you think, Mr. Choi?

288
00:22:38,440 --> 00:22:41,068
Yes, well, I like it. It's eye-catching.

289
00:22:41,651 --> 00:22:43,570
We'll go with this.

290
00:22:43,653 --> 00:22:46,406
Edit the details
and send it straight to the print shop.

291
00:22:46,490 --> 00:22:48,617
We'll go collect them
when they're printed.

292
00:22:48,700 --> 00:22:49,576
I understand.

293
00:22:49,659 --> 00:22:52,329
- Okay, thank you.
- Thank you.

294
00:22:52,412 --> 00:22:54,956
Everyone, let's pack up
the equipment first.

295
00:22:59,961 --> 00:23:01,755
Cheol-hui, you did a good job.

296
00:23:01,838 --> 00:23:03,507
I saw you in a new light today.

297
00:23:03,590 --> 00:23:05,092
You're a well-prepared groom.

298
00:23:06,426 --> 00:23:09,513
I'm grateful to Mr. Choi.
It went well thanks to him.

299
00:23:11,765 --> 00:23:12,766
Yes, well.

300
00:23:13,850 --> 00:23:15,602
I don't want to do that ever again.

301
00:23:16,561 --> 00:23:18,563
Cheol-hui, let's go back together.

302
00:23:18,647 --> 00:23:22,109
No, it's okay. I need to wash up
and return to the restaurant.

303
00:23:22,192 --> 00:23:23,902
You guys go ahead.

304
00:23:25,028 --> 00:23:26,738
Then we'll get going first.

305
00:23:26,822 --> 00:23:28,490
- I'm off too. Bye.
- Okay.

306
00:23:28,573 --> 00:23:29,616
See you.

307
00:23:32,410 --> 00:23:33,578
Let's go now.

308
00:23:33,662 --> 00:23:34,996
Okay.

309
00:23:53,807 --> 00:23:55,642
We're done with the poster photo shoot.

310
00:23:56,143 --> 00:23:57,352
We're on our way back.

311
00:23:58,436 --> 00:23:59,563
Oh, no.

312
00:24:36,057 --> 00:24:40,353
Is this the team where you matchmake
those who want to get married?

313
00:24:41,188 --> 00:24:43,899
I couldn't sign up on your website.

314
00:24:43,982 --> 00:24:45,317
You're right.

315
00:24:45,400 --> 00:24:48,486
Can you follow me inside?

316
00:24:49,279 --> 00:24:50,739
Over there, to the meeting room.

317
00:25:09,341 --> 00:25:11,218
Make yourself at home.

318
00:25:13,261 --> 00:25:14,471
Stall for time.

319
00:25:17,599 --> 00:25:18,808
Mr. Choi.

320
00:25:19,726 --> 00:25:20,769
Yes?

321
00:25:24,564 --> 00:25:28,401
Why don't we stop by the print shop
and collect the posters?

322
00:25:30,153 --> 00:25:32,906
It's better to start promoting
as soon as we can.

323
00:25:32,989 --> 00:25:36,826
If you're free in the evening,
we can have dinner together too.

324
00:25:39,162 --> 00:25:40,622
Sure, let's do that.

325
00:25:42,332 --> 00:25:43,625
Shall we go, then?

326
00:25:57,138 --> 00:26:00,016
So the most important thing for you

327
00:26:00,100 --> 00:26:04,271
is the trust between you and your partner?

328
00:26:04,354 --> 00:26:05,689
Yes, that's right.

329
00:26:05,772 --> 00:26:11,069
I see. We'll find the perfect one
for you and contact you.

330
00:26:11,820 --> 00:26:13,238
Okay, thank you.

331
00:26:13,321 --> 00:26:15,949
- Have a safe trip back.
- See you.

332
00:26:27,711 --> 00:26:29,045
- Cheol-hui.
- Yes.

333
00:26:29,921 --> 00:26:31,715
Ha-na. Why are you here at this hour?

334
00:26:32,299 --> 00:26:33,508
Did something happen?

335
00:26:34,301 --> 00:26:36,386
MARRIAGE MORALE BOOST PROJECT
MARRY YOU

336
00:26:36,469 --> 00:26:37,304
Looks good, right?

337
00:26:40,807 --> 00:26:43,310
- I'm going to put up the poster.
- Okay.

338
00:26:52,569 --> 00:26:54,779
- Mr. Choi.
- Yes?

339
00:26:54,863 --> 00:26:57,824
Can you put one outside of the store?

340
00:26:57,907 --> 00:26:59,826
I got the permission beforehand.

341
00:27:03,455 --> 00:27:04,456
Okay.

342
00:27:05,457 --> 00:27:06,458
I will.

343
00:27:10,295 --> 00:27:11,588
It looks good.

344
00:27:25,226 --> 00:27:26,186
You know…

345
00:27:26,770 --> 00:27:27,604
Yes?

346
00:27:28,521 --> 00:27:30,982
Actually, I've been wanting to ask you.

347
00:27:31,066 --> 00:27:32,150
What is it?

348
00:27:34,694 --> 00:27:36,112
Are you hurt anywhere?

349
00:27:37,364 --> 00:27:38,406
Hurt?

350
00:27:39,741 --> 00:27:42,202
- Am I hurt?
- No, yesterday…

351
00:27:47,040 --> 00:27:48,625
What about yesterday?

352
00:27:48,708 --> 00:27:50,835
Nothing. If you're fine, that's good.

353
00:27:51,461 --> 00:27:53,380
You're so boring.

354
00:27:53,963 --> 00:27:56,091
Do you need some salt
to spice yourself up?

355
00:27:57,759 --> 00:28:01,179
Did you check the match request heart
sent by Oh In-a yesterday?

356
00:28:02,180 --> 00:28:06,434
I got the notification
but didn't see anything on the screen.

357
00:28:06,518 --> 00:28:09,270
It must be because the site went down.

358
00:28:09,354 --> 00:28:11,523
We suddenly had a system error.

359
00:28:11,606 --> 00:28:13,942
I see. Well, things happen.

360
00:28:17,612 --> 00:28:20,573
Are you sure nothing bad happened to you?

361
00:28:21,449 --> 00:28:22,826
Something bad?

362
00:28:23,952 --> 00:28:25,120
Hold on.

363
00:28:25,203 --> 00:28:28,415
It's too bright
for something bad to happen to me.

364
00:28:31,209 --> 00:28:34,754
The city isn't like the island,
so you must go home early.

365
00:28:34,838 --> 00:28:37,215
The twins will also be worried
if you come home late.

366
00:28:37,298 --> 00:28:40,468
I get it. Don't worry about me.

367
00:28:41,594 --> 00:28:43,388
And Cheol-hui.

368
00:28:45,265 --> 00:28:46,433
I'm going to trust you.

369
00:28:49,060 --> 00:28:50,687
Okay. Be on your way.

370
00:28:54,649 --> 00:28:56,484
Okay. Let's go.

371
00:28:56,568 --> 00:28:58,194
- See you.
- We're off.

372
00:29:12,333 --> 00:29:13,752
Can we go back now?

373
00:29:13,835 --> 00:29:15,170
TEAM GROUP CHAT

374
00:29:16,004 --> 00:29:18,256
We're almost done,
but we need a bit more time.

375
00:29:18,339 --> 00:29:19,466
Aren't we leaving?

376
00:29:23,845 --> 00:29:27,599
Mr. Choi, where would you like
to eat dinner?

377
00:29:28,600 --> 00:29:30,185
I need to go back now.

378
00:29:30,268 --> 00:29:32,771
What? Already?

379
00:29:33,563 --> 00:29:34,689
"Already"?

380
00:29:36,524 --> 00:29:38,818
I mean, since we're out anyway,

381
00:29:38,902 --> 00:29:42,197
we can visit other restaurants
to put up the posters.

382
00:29:42,280 --> 00:29:44,991
I have to go back and report to the mayor.

383
00:29:45,074 --> 00:29:47,744
I need to check
if the website has been restored too.

384
00:29:47,827 --> 00:29:50,747
It's a simple task, so let's
finish it fast and then eat together.

385
00:29:50,830 --> 00:29:55,084
Oh, then you should go back first.

386
00:29:55,168 --> 00:29:56,419
Yes, that's right.

387
00:29:57,003 --> 00:29:58,254
Let's go.

388
00:29:58,338 --> 00:29:59,506
Okay.

389
00:30:03,343 --> 00:30:06,304
He can't go back yet. This is bad.

390
00:30:11,392 --> 00:30:13,144
- My goodness!
- I'm back.

391
00:30:13,228 --> 00:30:15,146
Ms. Jeong.

392
00:30:15,230 --> 00:30:17,440
You almost gave me a heart attack.

393
00:30:18,316 --> 00:30:20,985
Mr. Choi went to report to the mayor.

394
00:30:21,069 --> 00:30:23,071
I don't think he'll take long.

395
00:30:24,113 --> 00:30:26,366
- Is this your uncle, Ji-won?
- Yes.

396
00:30:27,617 --> 00:30:29,661
If this goes well,

397
00:30:29,744 --> 00:30:31,830
I'll make sure you get infinite matches.

398
00:30:32,664 --> 00:30:35,083
Oh, it's all right.

399
00:30:50,932 --> 00:30:53,768
As expected, is it praise over punishment?

400
00:30:55,103 --> 00:30:56,271
He got much faster.

401
00:31:18,209 --> 00:31:19,586
How much longer do you need?

402
00:31:19,669 --> 00:31:22,839
I still need more time.

403
00:31:22,922 --> 00:31:26,092
We're doomed.
Mr. Choi should be here soon.

404
00:31:35,935 --> 00:31:38,563
This is bad! I think Mr. Choi is here.

405
00:31:38,646 --> 00:31:39,772
Really?

406
00:31:39,856 --> 00:31:41,149
What should we do?

407
00:31:44,819 --> 00:31:45,820
Mr. Choi.

408
00:31:48,406 --> 00:31:50,450
Are you going somewhere, Ms. Jeong?

409
00:31:51,034 --> 00:31:53,411
No. I was waiting for you to come back.

410
00:31:54,203 --> 00:31:56,205
For me? Again?

411
00:31:56,289 --> 00:31:57,290
What took you so long?

412
00:31:57,373 --> 00:32:01,085
Why were you suddenly waiting for me?

413
00:32:01,169 --> 00:32:04,380
I think I had a conception dream recently.

414
00:32:04,464 --> 00:32:06,090
Yes, a conception dream.

415
00:32:06,174 --> 00:32:08,009
Yes, a conception dream.

416
00:32:09,302 --> 00:32:10,428
Aren't you curious?

417
00:32:10,511 --> 00:32:13,598
Wait here. Follow me, Mr. Choi.

418
00:32:13,681 --> 00:32:16,309
So I had a dream.

419
00:32:16,392 --> 00:32:17,977
A child this small

420
00:32:19,437 --> 00:32:21,481
appeared in my dream. When I saw…

421
00:32:24,984 --> 00:32:27,820
Mr. Choi will be back very soon. Hurry up.

422
00:32:27,904 --> 00:32:28,780
Okay.

423
00:32:47,382 --> 00:32:48,633
Please be quick.

424
00:33:26,462 --> 00:33:28,131
- Mr. Choi.
- Yes?

425
00:33:28,214 --> 00:33:29,841
The website is restored.

426
00:33:29,924 --> 00:33:31,759
When you go to the applicant list page,

427
00:33:31,843 --> 00:33:36,180
you can find the list of people
who walked in for consultations today too.

428
00:33:41,352 --> 00:33:42,603
Good job, Mr. Yang.

429
00:33:42,687 --> 00:33:44,188
It's my pleasure.

430
00:33:45,314 --> 00:33:47,567
Everyone, it's late. You can go home.

431
00:33:47,650 --> 00:33:48,860
Okay.

432
00:33:55,033 --> 00:33:56,075
Oh, wait.

433
00:33:57,410 --> 00:34:00,163
Ms. Jeong, see me
for a bit before you leave.

434
00:34:02,415 --> 00:34:04,876
I'll see you tomorrow, then.

435
00:34:05,626 --> 00:34:06,878
- Goodness.
- See you tomorrow.

436
00:34:20,183 --> 00:34:22,018
The website has been restored.

437
00:34:22,101 --> 00:34:25,646
You have three days to accept the match
after checking the heart.

438
00:34:25,730 --> 00:34:27,148
Don't forget!

439
00:34:30,818 --> 00:34:34,781
A HEART SENT TO YOU
BY OH IN-A, 32 YEARS OLD

440
00:34:35,948 --> 00:34:39,327
When I read the article
on your marriage project,

441
00:34:39,410 --> 00:34:40,453
I was secretly glad.

442
00:34:41,704 --> 00:34:43,873
Also the fact that you left the island.

443
00:34:44,874 --> 00:34:48,920
So you don't have to worry about me now.

444
00:35:01,808 --> 00:35:03,184
In-a.

445
00:35:03,851 --> 00:35:05,394
What brings you here?

446
00:35:08,272 --> 00:35:09,816
The restaurant is closed, right?

447
00:35:11,442 --> 00:35:13,653
I didn't get to have a single meal.

448
00:35:13,736 --> 00:35:15,321
You didn't eat at all until now?

449
00:35:16,489 --> 00:35:18,491
What were you doing?

450
00:35:19,534 --> 00:35:21,494
Are you okay with a simple rice bowl?

451
00:35:22,537 --> 00:35:23,955
That sounds nice.

452
00:35:24,038 --> 00:35:26,040
Then have a seat. I'll make a simple one.

453
00:35:28,876 --> 00:35:30,253
Thank you.

454
00:35:35,466 --> 00:35:38,594
WE'RE CLOSED EARLY TODAY
AS WE RAN OUT OF INGREDIENTS

455
00:35:39,762 --> 00:35:40,763
Here you go.

456
00:35:44,016 --> 00:35:44,892
Thank you.

457
00:35:55,528 --> 00:35:56,362
By the way,

458
00:35:58,030 --> 00:36:00,241
you still haven't accepted it.

459
00:36:02,618 --> 00:36:04,203
Do you not like me?

460
00:36:06,789 --> 00:36:09,000
That's impossible.

461
00:36:11,586 --> 00:36:16,090
I see. Have you not received the message
about the website being restored yet?

462
00:36:16,174 --> 00:36:18,050
Is that why?

463
00:36:21,137 --> 00:36:22,388
I did see it just now.

464
00:36:23,347 --> 00:36:26,350
What? So you did see it.

465
00:36:27,852 --> 00:36:29,979
Then why didn't you accept it?

466
00:36:30,062 --> 00:36:31,814
Do you really not like me?

467
00:36:32,565 --> 00:36:34,317
That's not it.

468
00:36:35,276 --> 00:36:38,946
I read your answer for the question
asking what marriage was

469
00:36:39,030 --> 00:36:41,741
on your information card.

470
00:36:43,242 --> 00:36:48,122
You wrote that it was trusting each other
and living together forever.

471
00:36:51,042 --> 00:36:56,672
Well, too many people approached me
with ulterior motives.

472
00:36:58,090 --> 00:37:01,135
How can I trust someone like that
and live together forever?

473
00:37:01,844 --> 00:37:04,805
I guess that could happen to you
since you're from a rich family.

474
00:37:06,224 --> 00:37:10,061
But I won't keep any secrets
from the person I'm going to marry.

475
00:37:11,938 --> 00:37:14,398
When secrets pile up,
they create a misunderstanding.

476
00:37:15,441 --> 00:37:17,652
In the end,
that relationship doesn't last.

477
00:37:22,823 --> 00:37:24,200
Wait, do you have a secret?

478
00:37:25,952 --> 00:37:29,121
Are Ba-da and San-i
actually your children or something?

479
00:37:30,915 --> 00:37:32,166
You could tell?

480
00:37:33,542 --> 00:37:34,669
My goodness.

481
00:37:35,836 --> 00:37:37,880
I was just joking.

482
00:37:50,685 --> 00:37:53,354
They're practically my own children.
Why would you…

483
00:38:00,736 --> 00:38:01,988
What is it?

484
00:38:04,949 --> 00:38:05,992
Look at this.

485
00:38:09,829 --> 00:38:11,122
What?

486
00:38:13,541 --> 00:38:16,335
My heart beats this fast
just from looking at you.

487
00:38:19,338 --> 00:38:21,215
So my confession was serious.

488
00:38:22,800 --> 00:38:23,801
Okay.

489
00:38:27,430 --> 00:38:29,473
I guess so.

490
00:38:31,559 --> 00:38:34,603
So go on a date with me.

491
00:38:36,397 --> 00:38:39,191
It'll be even better
if you tell me your secret then.

492
00:38:41,861 --> 00:38:42,862
Okay?

493
00:38:43,612 --> 00:38:46,449
Well, we'll see.

494
00:39:08,721 --> 00:39:10,056
Why did you want to see me?

495
00:39:10,890 --> 00:39:12,391
Is the dinner still on?

496
00:39:13,517 --> 00:39:14,518
What?

497
00:39:16,312 --> 00:39:19,357
Oh, right. Dinner.

498
00:39:20,441 --> 00:39:22,234
Actually…

499
00:39:23,819 --> 00:39:27,448
Forget it.
You worked extra hard today, Ms. Jeong.

500
00:39:28,407 --> 00:39:31,118
You stuck with me all day long
to help Mr. Yang.

501
00:39:31,202 --> 00:39:32,119
I knew that.

502
00:39:34,497 --> 00:39:37,291
I should've helped you
with the problem. I feel bad.

503
00:39:40,086 --> 00:39:42,129
I'm on this team too.

504
00:39:42,213 --> 00:39:44,215
For now, whether I like it or not.

505
00:39:45,341 --> 00:39:48,844
And you believed in your team members
and waited as the team leader.

506
00:39:48,928 --> 00:39:50,846
Let's say we both trusted each other.

507
00:39:53,224 --> 00:39:54,433
Let's do that.

508
00:39:55,309 --> 00:39:57,561
We can skip the dinner
if you're uncomfortable.

509
00:39:59,188 --> 00:40:03,484
Then I'd like to go somewhere with you
instead of dinner.

510
00:40:13,160 --> 00:40:14,453
It's been a while.

511
00:40:15,204 --> 00:40:18,874
Right. We first came here
for our group assignment in college.

512
00:40:21,085 --> 00:40:22,044
Yes.

513
00:40:22,753 --> 00:40:25,631
Oh In-a didn't show up,
so we struggled on our own.

514
00:40:29,677 --> 00:40:31,095
That's true.

515
00:40:41,939 --> 00:40:45,734
Choi Gi-jun, where are you?
You told me to come to campus.

516
00:40:45,818 --> 00:40:48,612
I'm sorry. Just go home today.

517
00:40:54,994 --> 00:40:57,538
Why isn't In-a here yet?

518
00:40:57,621 --> 00:40:59,582
What? Well…

519
00:41:01,584 --> 00:41:03,961
I'm not sure. I think she ditched us.

520
00:41:04,044 --> 00:41:05,671
Let's just do it ourselves.

521
00:41:07,173 --> 00:41:11,510
Gi-jun, I don't understand what
"international city Injeong City" means.

522
00:41:12,595 --> 00:41:15,598
Goods of different cultures
used to enter Korea from there,

523
00:41:15,681 --> 00:41:16,682
so it was crowded.

524
00:41:17,266 --> 00:41:20,853
It must be their vision to turn the city
into a renaissance like before.

525
00:41:22,104 --> 00:41:25,649
There are too many things to research.
We'll need to pull an all-nighter again.

526
00:41:26,233 --> 00:41:27,860
Don't worry and sleep well.

527
00:41:29,528 --> 00:41:30,362
Do you trust me?

528
00:41:34,825 --> 00:41:38,162
CAFÉ GURAKBU

529
00:41:42,458 --> 00:41:43,626
I remember.

530
00:41:44,627 --> 00:41:48,255
You asked if I trusted you and stayed up
all night to finish the assignment.

531
00:41:57,389 --> 00:42:00,601
After you got discharged,
you confessed to me at this café.

532
00:42:01,936 --> 00:42:04,605
You said, "I'll treat you well. Trust me."

533
00:42:06,565 --> 00:42:09,568
To keep my word, I studied hard
for the administration exam.

534
00:42:10,903 --> 00:42:12,363
I liked what you said.

535
00:42:13,489 --> 00:42:18,118
It felt like my world would be safe
as long as I kept trusting you.

536
00:42:21,872 --> 00:42:22,957
Ha-na.

537
00:42:23,457 --> 00:42:24,583
I'm sorry.

538
00:42:29,755 --> 00:42:31,382
I wanted to apologize, too.

539
00:42:33,050 --> 00:42:35,219
Even if I knew about it back then,

540
00:42:37,012 --> 00:42:39,014
I probably couldn't have handled it.

541
00:42:41,433 --> 00:42:44,687
So stop feeling bad about it.

542
00:42:47,064 --> 00:42:48,065
Just like before--

543
00:42:48,148 --> 00:42:51,694
Things have changed a lot for both of us.

544
00:42:58,200 --> 00:43:02,079
So let's just stay
as a senior and a junior.

545
00:43:04,582 --> 00:43:05,833
Don't you agree, Mr. Choi?

546
00:43:09,295 --> 00:43:12,923
Fine, that's cool. A senior and a junior.

547
00:43:14,758 --> 00:43:18,053
We can start from scratch.
Again from the starting line.

548
00:43:19,805 --> 00:43:21,223
Don't even dream of it.

549
00:43:33,861 --> 00:43:35,613
Wait, do you have a secret?

550
00:43:36,322 --> 00:43:39,033
When secrets pile up,
they create a misunderstanding.

551
00:43:39,992 --> 00:43:42,202
In the end,
that relationship doesn't last.

552
00:43:43,454 --> 00:43:46,582
Are you sure nothing bad happened to you?

553
00:43:47,541 --> 00:43:49,209
I'm going to trust you.

554
00:44:56,402 --> 00:44:59,405
Ha-na, why did you get so startled?

555
00:44:59,488 --> 00:45:00,656
Did something happen?

556
00:45:03,200 --> 00:45:05,911
My goodness. Are you okay?

557
00:45:07,371 --> 00:45:08,914
Thank goodness.

558
00:45:10,416 --> 00:45:13,794
I keep feeling like
someone is watching me nowadays.

559
00:45:15,421 --> 00:45:18,715
Goodness. There's nobody around.

560
00:45:18,799 --> 00:45:20,884
It's just me, Bong Cheol-hui.

561
00:45:21,468 --> 00:45:23,512
Let's hurry home.

562
00:45:24,179 --> 00:45:25,222
Oh, dear.

563
00:45:40,487 --> 00:45:41,530
Thank you.

564
00:45:43,740 --> 00:45:44,825
For what?

565
00:45:45,993 --> 00:45:47,953
I'm so glad it was you.

566
00:45:49,830 --> 00:45:52,875
That's right.
What would've happened if it wasn't me?

567
00:45:53,375 --> 00:45:56,336
You almost became a ghost
before you even got married.

568
00:45:57,004 --> 00:45:57,838
What?

569
00:45:59,965 --> 00:46:01,884
Thank the heavens for it.

570
00:46:03,594 --> 00:46:04,720
This is my home.

571
00:46:05,804 --> 00:46:08,265
Okay. Go in. I'll be on my way too.

572
00:46:12,978 --> 00:46:14,229
Cheol-hui.

573
00:46:14,730 --> 00:46:15,898
Yes?

574
00:46:16,482 --> 00:46:20,402
I told you to go back home early.
Why were you near my house?

575
00:46:21,069 --> 00:46:22,446
Did you want to say anything?

576
00:46:24,364 --> 00:46:26,366
I was taking a night walk.

577
00:46:27,743 --> 00:46:30,787
I should go home now. See you.

578
00:46:30,871 --> 00:46:31,997
Bye.

579
00:46:55,812 --> 00:46:57,606
Mr. Han, put up the email.

580
00:46:57,689 --> 00:46:58,857
Okay.

581
00:47:01,193 --> 00:47:02,611
JEONG HA-NA BE IN CHARGE OF ME

582
00:47:02,694 --> 00:47:04,446
Gosh, that's…

583
00:47:04,530 --> 00:47:06,114
The savior uncle.

584
00:47:07,991 --> 00:47:11,119
Ji-seok, who fixed the website,
sent us this email.

585
00:47:12,996 --> 00:47:15,082
Mr. Choi, did you know about this?

586
00:47:16,333 --> 00:47:18,752
I contacted him myself
to ask about modifications.

587
00:47:18,835 --> 00:47:20,254
I wanted to thank him too.

588
00:47:20,963 --> 00:47:25,384
Of course, I'm grateful to Mr. Yang
and the team's prompt action.

589
00:47:28,470 --> 00:47:32,057
But why is his application so long-winded?

590
00:47:33,267 --> 00:47:37,521
The point is, he wants to join
Marriage Morale Boost Project officially.

591
00:47:37,604 --> 00:47:38,855
Also,

592
00:47:39,815 --> 00:47:43,652
he wants Ms. Jeong Ha-na
to be in charge of him.

593
00:47:47,489 --> 00:47:49,950
It'll be another long day.

594
00:47:50,742 --> 00:47:52,619
- Let's end the meeting here.
- Okay.

595
00:47:52,703 --> 00:47:54,871
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

596
00:47:54,955 --> 00:47:55,998
Thank you.

597
00:48:01,211 --> 00:48:02,504
Ha-na.

598
00:48:02,588 --> 00:48:04,715
Are you not coming
to singing practice today?

599
00:48:04,798 --> 00:48:07,050
I can't make it today either.

600
00:48:07,134 --> 00:48:09,052
MUSIC TEACHER

601
00:48:15,058 --> 00:48:16,977
TODAY'S LUNCH SPECIAL,
ABALONE RICE BOWL

602
00:48:41,668 --> 00:48:43,170
I hate to say this,

603
00:48:43,253 --> 00:48:45,505
but there's no special
since it's past lunchtime.

604
00:48:47,424 --> 00:48:49,926
But if you're here for that, I'll make it.

605
00:48:53,972 --> 00:48:57,601
Yes, I'm the Marriage Morale
Boost Project's island guy,

606
00:48:57,684 --> 00:48:58,810
Bong Cheol-hui.

607
00:49:00,520 --> 00:49:04,399
I'll cook you the special.
Give me a moment.

608
00:49:08,654 --> 00:49:09,529
Wait.

609
00:49:18,455 --> 00:49:24,503
So you're saying
you applied for the project too, right?

610
00:49:25,420 --> 00:49:26,546
Yes.

611
00:49:26,630 --> 00:49:31,259
But you're worried about sending a heart
to the person you want to be matched with.

612
00:49:33,261 --> 00:49:34,346
Yes.

613
00:49:34,429 --> 00:49:37,057
On that topic, I also have
a lot to worry about.

614
00:49:38,684 --> 00:49:40,852
Did you feel the same way too?

615
00:49:40,936 --> 00:49:42,479
Of course.

616
00:49:42,562 --> 00:49:45,357
This isn't just some blind date.
I'm looking for my spouse.

617
00:49:45,440 --> 00:49:46,608
Of course I got worried.

618
00:49:48,735 --> 00:49:52,698
I have trouble talking with strangers.

619
00:49:53,240 --> 00:49:54,241
What?

620
00:49:58,161 --> 00:50:02,999
Then is your MBTI…

621
00:50:04,418 --> 00:50:08,672
Yes, a 100%, extreme I for introvert.

622
00:50:11,508 --> 00:50:14,594
Then that changes things.

623
00:50:25,480 --> 00:50:26,565
Hey.

624
00:50:27,149 --> 00:50:28,692
Are you going out for work?

625
00:50:30,819 --> 00:50:34,698
Ji-seok is very introverted,
so the blind date location is important.

626
00:50:35,282 --> 00:50:36,366
I see.

627
00:50:38,034 --> 00:50:40,078
- I'll go with you--
- Hello?

628
00:50:42,539 --> 00:50:43,623
I…

629
00:50:46,877 --> 00:50:48,462
I can go with her.

630
00:50:53,383 --> 00:50:55,927
I want to send my heart to her.

631
00:50:58,764 --> 00:51:01,850
"Someone I can trust."

632
00:51:02,434 --> 00:51:05,145
Yes. I like honest people.

633
00:51:05,228 --> 00:51:08,857
I like coding because it gives me
exactly what I put in.

634
00:51:10,275 --> 00:51:13,111
It feels like working with someone
who doesn't lie.

635
00:51:14,863 --> 00:51:15,906
That's right.

636
00:51:16,615 --> 00:51:19,743
When you lie, it turns into a secret.

637
00:51:19,826 --> 00:51:22,746
When secrets pile up,
it creates a misunderstanding.

638
00:51:24,623 --> 00:51:26,291
I should start being honest.

639
00:51:30,754 --> 00:51:33,632
Here. Try to have the courage.

640
00:51:33,715 --> 00:51:34,966
What?

641
00:51:35,050 --> 00:51:36,176
Come on.

642
00:51:45,769 --> 00:51:46,770
Goodness.

643
00:51:48,814 --> 00:51:51,858
It'll go well.

644
00:51:53,193 --> 00:51:54,361
MATCH COMPLETE

645
00:51:56,530 --> 00:51:59,074
Gosh, I pressed it…

646
00:52:01,159 --> 00:52:02,786
It's okay.

647
00:52:05,831 --> 00:52:06,915
Cheol-hui.

648
00:52:09,376 --> 00:52:10,961
Hello, Ha-na.

649
00:52:11,920 --> 00:52:13,630
- Hello, Ji-seok.
- Hello.

650
00:52:14,756 --> 00:52:18,802
Ji-seok pressed the match request himself.

651
00:52:19,386 --> 00:52:20,220
Really?

652
00:52:20,303 --> 00:52:23,306
I knew you two would get along just fine.

653
00:52:27,853 --> 00:52:31,106
I recommended he come and have a meal here
when he was worried.

654
00:52:31,189 --> 00:52:34,025
Then all his worries would disappear.

655
00:52:37,070 --> 00:52:38,196
Oh, gosh.

656
00:52:38,280 --> 00:52:39,823
MATCH ACCEPTED

657
00:52:39,906 --> 00:52:41,783
She just accepted the match.

658
00:52:43,493 --> 00:52:44,870
She accepted it.

659
00:52:46,204 --> 00:52:48,748
- I--
- I told you it'd work out.

660
00:52:48,832 --> 00:52:51,084
I knew she would like you too.

661
00:52:51,751 --> 00:52:53,587
This has never happened before, right?

662
00:52:55,797 --> 00:52:58,717
Cheol-hui, thank you so much.
It's thanks to you.

663
00:53:30,957 --> 00:53:33,710
Would you like to order?

664
00:53:34,377 --> 00:53:38,423
Yes, I'll get what I had last time.

665
00:53:38,506 --> 00:53:41,176
The abalones from Wando Island.

666
00:53:41,259 --> 00:53:42,260
- Yes.
- Okay.

667
00:53:42,344 --> 00:53:44,220
And for her…

668
00:53:45,639 --> 00:53:46,890
Well…

669
00:53:48,892 --> 00:53:51,227
Can you recommend something?

670
00:53:51,811 --> 00:53:52,729
A recommendation?

671
00:53:52,812 --> 00:53:55,649
Then what about this?
There's a dish called kaisen yaki udon.

672
00:53:55,732 --> 00:53:57,067
It's not on the menu,

673
00:53:57,150 --> 00:54:00,195
but since Ji-seok brought you here,
I'll cook it specially for you.

674
00:54:01,655 --> 00:54:03,448
That would be great.

675
00:54:03,531 --> 00:54:05,241
I'd like that.

676
00:54:05,325 --> 00:54:06,910
Wait for a while.

677
00:54:20,966 --> 00:54:22,509
You go first.

678
00:54:22,592 --> 00:54:24,302
No, you go first, Ji-seok.

679
00:54:59,796 --> 00:55:01,840
Enjoy your food.

680
00:55:01,923 --> 00:55:03,049
Thank you.

681
00:55:06,553 --> 00:55:08,221
- Go ahead.
- Okay.

682
00:55:17,272 --> 00:55:18,898
It's very delicious.

683
00:55:18,982 --> 00:55:20,233
Yes, it's delicious.

684
00:55:26,448 --> 00:55:32,620
For me, choosing what to eat and ordering
are the hardest things to do in the world.

685
00:55:33,830 --> 00:55:37,917
So I prefer restaurants with kiosks.

686
00:55:38,877 --> 00:55:41,713
It's hard to call a waiter and order.

687
00:55:43,173 --> 00:55:47,218
I also tend to go to places
that I'm familiar with.

688
00:55:48,136 --> 00:55:51,389
It's hard for me to go to crowded places.

689
00:55:52,891 --> 00:55:58,271
Nowadays, we can do pretty much everything
from home, which I'm grateful for.

690
00:56:01,107 --> 00:56:02,901
I'm relieved.

691
00:56:04,277 --> 00:56:05,278
What?

692
00:56:05,904 --> 00:56:08,198
We're both introverts, so we can relate.

693
00:56:09,449 --> 00:56:11,785
We won't misunderstand each other either.

694
00:56:14,370 --> 00:56:15,955
I'm relieved

695
00:56:16,039 --> 00:56:19,667
that I met someone
who likes my personality.

696
00:56:21,211 --> 00:56:24,589
Especially the fact that you can
anticipate where the other person will be.

697
00:56:24,672 --> 00:56:26,716
That's a huge merit.

698
00:56:26,800 --> 00:56:29,511
It prevents unnecessary misunderstandings.

699
00:56:30,261 --> 00:56:31,638
Yes, I agree.

700
00:56:31,721 --> 00:56:35,308
You need to get rid of unnecessary
misunderstandings to trust each other.

701
00:56:36,935 --> 00:56:41,689
If I were to get married, I'd like to
get married to someone who trusts me.

702
00:56:42,398 --> 00:56:44,359
For that to happen,

703
00:56:44,442 --> 00:56:47,946
I believe I must behave
in a trustworthy manner first.

704
00:56:49,948 --> 00:56:53,576
Actually, I wrote "someone I can trust"

705
00:56:53,660 --> 00:56:57,038
as the most important thing
I see in my partner.

706
00:56:57,122 --> 00:57:00,708
Rather than someone who is fun

707
00:57:00,792 --> 00:57:04,963
but likes to bluff and exaggerate
and is unpredictable,

708
00:57:05,046 --> 00:57:09,175
I prefer someone who is quiet
but careful, honest,

709
00:57:09,259 --> 00:57:11,052
and predictable.

710
00:57:11,719 --> 00:57:15,890
Then I think I fit in those categories.

711
00:57:22,147 --> 00:57:24,983
They say trust is the glue of life.

712
00:57:27,026 --> 00:57:29,904
The stronger the trust,
the closer the relationship gets.

713
00:57:31,322 --> 00:57:33,658
But building that trust

714
00:57:34,701 --> 00:57:36,661
isn't as easy as we think.

715
00:57:38,663 --> 00:57:41,082
Trust is directly proportional.

716
00:57:42,917 --> 00:57:45,378
If I find someone suspicious,

717
00:57:46,087 --> 00:57:48,631
it means that person
finds me suspicious too.

718
00:57:51,050 --> 00:57:52,760
If I trust someone,

719
00:57:53,720 --> 00:57:57,932
it means that person trusts me
to the same degree.

720
00:58:01,936 --> 00:58:06,107
How trustworthy will others find me?

721
00:58:09,068 --> 00:58:11,571
WE FINALLY HAVE
A SUCCESSFUL MATCH!

722
00:58:13,156 --> 00:58:15,783
It succeeded. Look.

723
00:58:15,867 --> 00:58:17,076
Yes!

724
00:58:20,413 --> 00:58:21,456
Mr. Choi.

725
00:58:39,516 --> 00:58:41,100
What is wrong with him?

726
00:58:41,893 --> 00:58:44,437
- It's his first love.
- What?

727
00:58:45,188 --> 00:58:46,439
Since when?

728
00:58:46,523 --> 00:58:48,983
He met her last week on a playground
and fell in love.

729
00:58:49,859 --> 00:58:53,238
- Did she reject him?
- He didn't even confess.

730
00:58:53,321 --> 00:58:55,949
Even when they played on the swings
and the slide together.

731
00:58:57,158 --> 00:58:59,869
Oh, dear.

732
00:58:59,953 --> 00:59:03,748
She even said my dialect was cute.

733
00:59:06,000 --> 00:59:07,126
Goodness.

734
00:59:08,461 --> 00:59:10,380
A week? That was fast.

735
00:59:11,464 --> 00:59:13,341
- Uncle.
- Yes?

736
00:59:13,424 --> 00:59:17,011
Stuff like that isn't important
when it comes to love.

737
00:59:17,971 --> 00:59:20,139
It's all about timing.

738
00:59:23,518 --> 00:59:24,519
Timing?

739
00:59:27,021 --> 00:59:29,440
I'm going out for a bit. Stay here.

740
00:59:29,524 --> 00:59:30,358
Okay.

741
00:59:38,116 --> 00:59:39,325
How cute.

742
00:59:42,954 --> 00:59:43,955
What's this?

743
00:59:45,748 --> 00:59:48,167
Did he not live on the island
five years ago?

744
00:59:50,128 --> 00:59:54,549
I WILL REMEMBER YOU

745
01:00:14,819 --> 01:00:15,903
Cheol-hui.

746
01:00:17,572 --> 01:00:19,115
What brings you here at this hour?

747
01:00:21,576 --> 01:00:22,660
Ha-na.

748
01:00:23,244 --> 01:00:24,120
Yes?

749
01:00:24,203 --> 01:00:27,540
There's something I must tell you.

750
01:00:29,000 --> 01:00:30,043
What is it?

751
01:00:31,044 --> 01:00:36,633
I am… telling you this
because I trust you.

752
01:00:40,303 --> 01:00:42,597
I have something to confess to you.

753
01:00:45,892 --> 01:00:47,060
You want to confess?

754
01:00:48,478 --> 01:00:50,063
I am…

755
01:00:54,067 --> 01:00:55,151
Who's that?

756
01:00:55,943 --> 01:00:56,778
Who's there?

757
01:01:02,950 --> 01:01:04,619
Cheol-hui, what's happening?

758
01:01:19,467 --> 01:01:20,635
Don't look.

759
01:01:27,600 --> 01:01:31,771
GET LOST

760
01:01:59,716 --> 01:02:01,467
What's going on over there?

761
01:02:01,551 --> 01:02:03,302
Did you apply?

762
01:02:03,386 --> 01:02:05,346
Marriage has a rule

763
01:02:05,430 --> 01:02:09,350
of sticking to one person forever.

764
01:02:09,434 --> 01:02:11,686
- Are you prepared…
- They're my nephew and niece.

765
01:02:11,769 --> 01:02:13,479
…for it?

766
01:02:13,563 --> 01:02:16,774
You can feel fluttered in a short moment.

767
01:02:16,858 --> 01:02:18,943
I think In-a is very determined.
Good for her.

768
01:02:19,026 --> 01:02:21,237
You stayed out all night
on your first blind date?

769
01:02:21,320 --> 01:02:24,323
It'll be bad if they fall in too quickly
and cool down fast.

770
01:02:24,407 --> 01:02:27,452
What is Oh In-a thinking
when she goes straight for him?

771
01:02:27,535 --> 01:02:31,414
Will In-a think the twins are a burden?

772
01:02:31,497 --> 01:02:35,042
Your nephew and niece could
hinder your future.

773
01:02:35,126 --> 01:02:36,043
Dad?

774
01:02:36,127 --> 01:02:38,880
He said he'd come back to take us
when we were ten.

775
01:02:38,963 --> 01:02:40,214
How old are you guys now?

776
01:02:40,298 --> 01:02:42,049
We're ten now.

777
01:02:42,133 --> 01:02:45,803
A suspicious man with a similar build
keeps being spotted around your house.

778
01:02:45,887 --> 01:02:47,388
I didn't order anything.

779
01:02:49,056 --> 01:02:50,558
It's not…

780
01:02:51,225 --> 01:02:52,435
What happened?

781
01:02:52,518 --> 01:02:55,021
It's not clear, but it's him.

782
01:02:55,104 --> 01:02:57,482
Who on earth are you?

783
01:03:00,151 --> 01:03:05,156
