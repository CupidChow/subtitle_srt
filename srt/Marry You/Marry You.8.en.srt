1
00:00:36,578 --> 00:00:37,871
ALL CHARACTERS, ORGANIZATIONS,
AND PLACES ARE FICTITIOUS

2
00:00:37,954 --> 00:00:39,289
FILMING OF CHILD ACTORS DONE
UNDER BROADCASTING GUIDELINES

3
00:00:57,432 --> 00:00:58,683
Excuse me, Ha-na.

4
00:00:59,976 --> 00:01:01,436
Why are we here?

5
00:01:02,353 --> 00:01:04,481
You said you wanted to
rewrite your profile.

6
00:01:04,564 --> 00:01:07,484
Your preferences differ
depending on the books you like.

7
00:01:07,567 --> 00:01:12,280
Really? I guess that kind of stuff
is important these days.

8
00:01:12,363 --> 00:01:13,823
Go and choose a book you like.

9
00:01:19,829 --> 00:01:20,789
Okay.

10
00:01:25,043 --> 00:01:28,213
A PANDA'S DAY

11
00:01:29,631 --> 00:01:32,258
San-i and Ba-da would love this.

12
00:01:34,093 --> 00:01:36,471
Cheol-hui, choose a book that you like.

13
00:01:37,889 --> 00:01:39,349
What happened?

14
00:01:39,432 --> 00:01:40,809
Did you cut yourself?

15
00:01:43,770 --> 00:01:44,813
Hold on a second.

16
00:01:48,817 --> 00:01:51,945
Ba-da always puts one of these in my bag.

17
00:01:52,028 --> 00:01:53,696
I get to use it today.

18
00:01:55,406 --> 00:01:56,533
What?

19
00:01:59,119 --> 00:02:00,245
This must hurt.

20
00:02:08,419 --> 00:02:09,546
Are you okay?

21
00:02:10,755 --> 00:02:12,966
THE CUPID
WHO SHOT A GOLDEN ARROW

22
00:02:13,758 --> 00:02:17,137
It found its mark.

23
00:02:17,804 --> 00:02:19,180
Excuse me?

24
00:02:29,315 --> 00:02:30,692
I just…

25
00:02:33,903 --> 00:02:36,531
You almost ended up
with a bump on your head.

26
00:02:45,331 --> 00:02:46,416
Where did they go?

27
00:02:46,499 --> 00:02:48,167
I don't know. They were just here.

28
00:02:48,918 --> 00:02:50,795
THE CUPID
WHO SHOT A GOLDEN ARROW

29
00:02:53,923 --> 00:02:55,675
Why did you bring that book?

30
00:02:59,012 --> 00:03:00,346
How did this get here?

31
00:03:03,224 --> 00:03:04,684
I meant to choose this one.

32
00:03:07,437 --> 00:03:10,481
What's your travel destination preference?

33
00:03:11,816 --> 00:03:13,776
Do you like
tourist attractions or resorts?

34
00:03:13,860 --> 00:03:15,445
I like tourist attractions.

35
00:03:17,822 --> 00:03:20,533
I like resorts.

36
00:03:23,661 --> 00:03:25,580
Where will we sleep?

37
00:03:27,373 --> 00:03:28,583
Sleep?

38
00:03:29,250 --> 00:03:30,960
What do you mean "where will we sleep?"

39
00:03:31,044 --> 00:03:32,295
What?

40
00:03:32,378 --> 00:03:36,007
That's not what I was asking.
You know what I mean.

41
00:03:36,090 --> 00:03:40,553
Some people like to camp
while others like hotels.

42
00:03:42,472 --> 00:03:45,308
I like hotels
and their delicious breakfast.

43
00:03:45,934 --> 00:03:47,602
I like camping.

44
00:03:47,685 --> 00:03:50,438
You know, with a bonfire.

45
00:03:53,358 --> 00:03:56,736
Then which country
would you like to travel to?

46
00:03:56,819 --> 00:03:58,196
I like warm countries.

47
00:03:58,279 --> 00:04:01,449
I like countries with tons of snow.
It's so cold that your hands freeze.

48
00:04:05,536 --> 00:04:06,621
Well…

49
00:04:14,170 --> 00:04:17,131
You and I have completely opposite tastes.

50
00:04:17,799 --> 00:04:21,469
Right, I suppose so.

51
00:04:22,804 --> 00:04:23,638
Let's go.

52
00:04:25,974 --> 00:04:26,975
They're leaving.

53
00:04:27,058 --> 00:04:28,226
What are you doing?

54
00:04:28,309 --> 00:04:29,310
Let's go.

55
00:04:35,108 --> 00:04:36,401
Shall we eat now?

56
00:04:36,943 --> 00:04:38,486
Why don't you decide what to eat?

57
00:04:38,987 --> 00:04:40,029
Okay.

58
00:04:44,993 --> 00:04:46,369
How about tteokbokki?

59
00:04:47,912 --> 00:04:48,788
Okay.

60
00:04:50,957 --> 00:04:52,625
Are you not a fan of tteokbokki?

61
00:04:53,334 --> 00:04:54,877
Then how about pizza?

62
00:04:55,795 --> 00:04:56,796
Okay.

63
00:04:59,007 --> 00:05:00,466
You don't care for pizza?

64
00:05:01,009 --> 00:05:02,385
Then how about…

65
00:05:03,011 --> 00:05:04,512
How about grilled meat?

66
00:05:04,595 --> 00:05:05,596
Okay.

67
00:05:07,390 --> 00:05:08,683
You don't like that either?

68
00:05:11,602 --> 00:05:13,229
- Cheol-hui!
- Yes?

69
00:05:21,946 --> 00:05:24,240
I can't do this.

70
00:05:24,324 --> 00:05:25,658
What do you mean?

71
00:05:25,742 --> 00:05:28,661
I have an important appointment today,

72
00:05:28,745 --> 00:05:29,912
but it slipped my mind.

73
00:05:30,997 --> 00:05:33,333
Didn't you want to find
your preferences today?

74
00:05:33,416 --> 00:05:36,044
Right. I wanted to, but…

75
00:05:36,127 --> 00:05:38,046
Ha-na, you should go singing.

76
00:05:38,129 --> 00:05:40,173
It's the weekend after all.

77
00:05:40,965 --> 00:05:42,759
We should still eat before we go.

78
00:05:42,842 --> 00:05:44,010
I'm on a diet now.

79
00:05:44,093 --> 00:05:45,636
What? All of a sudden?

80
00:05:45,720 --> 00:05:49,015
I have a body profile photo shoot
two weeks from now.

81
00:05:49,515 --> 00:05:51,100
See you later.

82
00:05:52,143 --> 00:05:53,895
You're seriously taking off?

83
00:05:55,104 --> 00:05:57,648
Darn it.

84
00:06:02,528 --> 00:06:04,864
When did they get untied?

85
00:06:10,078 --> 00:06:11,370
What is he doing?

86
00:06:15,500 --> 00:06:17,919
Noticing little things like this means
it's game over.

87
00:06:18,002 --> 00:06:20,296
Don't trip and fall
on your way home again.

88
00:06:25,885 --> 00:06:27,345
I'm going now.

89
00:06:28,554 --> 00:06:30,056
You're really leaving?

90
00:06:30,139 --> 00:06:31,140
Yes.

91
00:06:47,824 --> 00:06:51,327
I once thought being curious
about someone with different tastes

92
00:06:51,410 --> 00:06:54,038
was a green flag.

93
00:06:56,666 --> 00:06:58,543
But now I know better.

94
00:07:01,087 --> 00:07:04,924
It's a fleeting emotion
stemming from curiosity.

95
00:07:06,968 --> 00:07:10,596
It's an emotion
that you tend to lose easily.

96
00:07:19,480 --> 00:07:20,606
Can I take your order?

97
00:07:20,690 --> 00:07:22,650
- We'll get--
- The super supreme pizza.

98
00:07:22,733 --> 00:07:24,193
With the thinnest crust possible.

99
00:07:24,277 --> 00:07:25,236
And no parsley.

100
00:07:25,319 --> 00:07:27,530
- With two zero sugar sodas.
- And no pickles.

101
00:07:27,613 --> 00:07:29,490
- For the dipping sauce--
- Garlic, please.

102
00:07:31,325 --> 00:07:34,078
Right. I'll put your order in.

103
00:07:42,753 --> 00:07:44,338
They looked very close.

104
00:07:44,839 --> 00:07:46,215
Right?

105
00:07:48,009 --> 00:07:49,594
They touched each other too.

106
00:07:51,804 --> 00:07:53,014
Maybe they like each other?

107
00:07:54,182 --> 00:07:56,684
No, that can't be right.

108
00:07:57,393 --> 00:07:59,270
I'm Oh In-a, and he turned me down.

109
00:08:00,563 --> 00:08:02,231
Cheol-hui wouldn't go for Ha-na.

110
00:08:03,316 --> 00:08:06,736
That makes no sense at all.

111
00:08:07,361 --> 00:08:08,362
Right.

112
00:08:09,238 --> 00:08:11,782
Ha-na isn't the type to meet just anyone.

113
00:08:12,533 --> 00:08:14,368
Hey, Choi Gi-jun.

114
00:08:15,161 --> 00:08:15,995
What?

115
00:08:18,122 --> 00:08:20,291
Forget it.

116
00:08:20,374 --> 00:08:23,628
She's obviously acting this way
because she hates you so much.

117
00:08:24,879 --> 00:08:26,714
She must've been desperate to escape you.

118
00:08:26,797 --> 00:08:28,966
What civil servant gives up their weekend?

119
00:08:29,050 --> 00:08:31,135
She's not the type to do that.

120
00:08:32,345 --> 00:08:33,888
Here's your pizza.

121
00:08:36,015 --> 00:08:37,350
- Enjoy.
- Thank you.

122
00:08:49,946 --> 00:08:51,280
I can't do this.

123
00:08:52,615 --> 00:08:54,450
What do you mean?

124
00:09:14,262 --> 00:09:15,888
What's wrong? Are you okay?

125
00:09:15,972 --> 00:09:17,348
Uncle, your face is red.

126
00:09:19,725 --> 00:09:21,018
Are you sick?

127
00:09:21,978 --> 00:09:23,020
I just…

128
00:09:24,063 --> 00:09:26,023
I feel a little weird.

129
00:09:26,691 --> 00:09:28,818
You do? Go to the hospital then.

130
00:09:30,695 --> 00:09:33,739
I don't think a doctor can help me.

131
00:09:38,661 --> 00:09:40,538
Uncle, what's this?

132
00:09:40,621 --> 00:09:41,747
I'm reading this first.

133
00:09:41,831 --> 00:09:43,207
No, I will!

134
00:09:43,291 --> 00:09:46,127
- No, me first!
- Give that back!

135
00:09:46,210 --> 00:09:48,087
- After I'm done!
- No!

136
00:09:48,170 --> 00:09:49,463
Give it to me!

137
00:09:51,757 --> 00:09:54,302
Will you stop racing?

138
00:09:59,640 --> 00:10:00,850
Cut it out!

139
00:10:04,979 --> 00:10:07,690
Stop it!

140
00:10:21,037 --> 00:10:22,413
Ha-na!

141
00:10:24,957 --> 00:10:26,751
Hurry up and come here!

142
00:10:51,942 --> 00:10:52,902
Oh, no.

143
00:11:00,743 --> 00:11:02,328
I'm wearing comfortable shoes.

144
00:11:05,456 --> 00:11:07,833
These are light. If I run, I'll make it.

145
00:11:10,002 --> 00:11:11,754
Please wait!

146
00:11:11,837 --> 00:11:13,047
I'm sorry.

147
00:11:15,257 --> 00:11:16,217
TEAM GROUP CHAT

148
00:11:16,300 --> 00:11:18,177
I'M RUNNING LATE

149
00:11:21,180 --> 00:11:22,139
I'm running late.

150
00:12:45,097 --> 00:12:46,515
Let's have our weekly meeting.

151
00:12:48,017 --> 00:12:52,104
Here's the status report
on the Marriage Morale Boost Project.

152
00:12:52,188 --> 00:12:54,815
As you can see,
we have a total of 90 applicants.

153
00:12:54,899 --> 00:12:57,985
There are 28 people in their 20s,
44 people in their 30s,

154
00:12:58,068 --> 00:13:01,697
16 people in their 40s,
and 2 people in their 50s.

155
00:13:01,780 --> 00:13:03,824
We have 35 matched couples so far.

156
00:13:03,908 --> 00:13:06,368
THINK CAREFULLY AND ANSWER
FIND YOUR IDEAL TYPE

157
00:13:06,452 --> 00:13:09,538
TOP 3 IDEAL TYPE REQUIREMENTS

158
00:13:15,211 --> 00:13:16,795
FIND YOUR IDEAL TYPE

159
00:13:16,879 --> 00:13:19,798
Questions about finding your ideal type?

160
00:13:23,177 --> 00:13:26,263
Come to think of it,
I've never asked about your ideal type.

161
00:13:28,682 --> 00:13:32,144
I don't really have a specific type.

162
00:13:32,228 --> 00:13:34,730
Does someone come to mind
in terms of looks?

163
00:13:37,274 --> 00:13:38,317
Well…

164
00:13:39,401 --> 00:13:42,196
It looks like you do.

165
00:13:42,279 --> 00:13:44,990
Yes, I suppose so.

166
00:13:45,074 --> 00:13:47,201
Who is it?

167
00:13:50,329 --> 00:13:53,040
Ms. Moon.

168
00:13:54,250 --> 00:13:58,587
Are you attracted to someone
with similar or different tastes?

169
00:13:59,880 --> 00:14:04,593
Well, having different tastes
can be a bit difficult

170
00:14:04,677 --> 00:14:06,804
because there's not much
you can do together.

171
00:14:07,596 --> 00:14:09,515
What's so difficult?

172
00:14:09,598 --> 00:14:12,059
It could be fun
getting to know each other.

173
00:14:13,143 --> 00:14:14,270
Really?

174
00:14:15,813 --> 00:14:20,067
So, Cheol-hui,
does this ideal woman of yours

175
00:14:20,150 --> 00:14:22,653
have different tastes from you?

176
00:14:26,490 --> 00:14:27,491
Yes.

177
00:14:28,701 --> 00:14:30,160
What?

178
00:14:30,244 --> 00:14:32,496
No.

179
00:14:33,205 --> 00:14:34,665
Who could it be?

180
00:14:34,748 --> 00:14:36,750
Who made you like this?

181
00:14:36,834 --> 00:14:38,210
It's no one.

182
00:14:40,045 --> 00:14:42,047
Who is it? Tell me.

183
00:14:52,141 --> 00:14:54,226
Kim Jun-wu and Lee Yeo-reum could be

184
00:14:54,310 --> 00:14:56,937
our team's first marriage success case.

185
00:14:57,021 --> 00:14:57,938
Yes.

186
00:14:58,022 --> 00:15:01,150
But Ms. Lee said there was one thing
she was concerned about

187
00:15:01,233 --> 00:15:03,235
among the special notes she handed over.

188
00:15:03,319 --> 00:15:04,570
What is it?

189
00:15:05,154 --> 00:15:08,115
Well, you worry about everything
before a wedding.

190
00:15:08,198 --> 00:15:11,911
You can't agree on anything from A to Z
and fight to death.

191
00:15:11,994 --> 00:15:15,372
You even talk about how
you can't go through with the wedding.

192
00:15:15,456 --> 00:15:20,085
What is it called? "Blue marry"?
There's a reason that term exists.

193
00:15:21,670 --> 00:15:23,339
Does he mean marriage blues?

194
00:15:23,422 --> 00:15:26,967
But if you somehow
make your way down the aisle,

195
00:15:27,051 --> 00:15:31,263
then your love will rekindle and such.

196
00:15:32,097 --> 00:15:33,807
It's not really about the marriage blues.

197
00:15:33,891 --> 00:15:37,853
They're worried about
being too busy to plan a wedding.

198
00:15:37,937 --> 00:15:39,229
Oh, they're busy.

199
00:15:40,356 --> 00:15:42,900
If that's the case, we can help them.

200
00:15:42,983 --> 00:15:44,443
Welcome, sir!

201
00:15:45,903 --> 00:15:49,740
I've seen this before.
I have a bad feeling about this.

202
00:15:50,491 --> 00:15:52,993
I think I arrived at the right time.

203
00:15:53,077 --> 00:15:55,329
Great timing, sir.

204
00:15:56,246 --> 00:16:00,668
Our team should step up and handle
any concerns the applicants have, right?

205
00:16:02,044 --> 00:16:04,046
Our first matched couple
is getting married.

206
00:16:04,129 --> 00:16:05,965
We can't just stand by, can we?

207
00:16:06,048 --> 00:16:09,843
Yes, sir. We'll do our best
to help the newlyweds-to-be.

208
00:16:11,553 --> 00:16:13,055
I knew it.

209
00:16:13,138 --> 00:16:14,098
You're the best.

210
00:16:24,108 --> 00:16:25,484
As the mayor said,

211
00:16:25,567 --> 00:16:29,488
I believe we should step up
and help this couple.

212
00:16:35,285 --> 00:16:36,996
Ms. Jeong, please manage this case.

213
00:16:39,415 --> 00:16:40,374
Excuse me?

214
00:16:40,457 --> 00:16:44,211
Ms. Lee isn't here,
so someone should follow up on this.

215
00:16:44,294 --> 00:16:48,507
I think Mr. Yang and I will need to divide
Ms. Lee's workload and take over.

216
00:16:49,466 --> 00:16:52,219
I'd like to focus more on Mr. Bong's case.

217
00:16:52,302 --> 00:16:54,054
You won't handle his case anymore.

218
00:16:54,596 --> 00:16:56,056
Excuse me?

219
00:16:56,140 --> 00:16:57,516
Didn't you hear me?

220
00:16:57,599 --> 00:16:59,601
I'll handle Mr. Bong's case for now.

221
00:17:01,770 --> 00:17:03,355
Why all of a sudden?

222
00:17:03,439 --> 00:17:05,691
You've failed to match him twice,

223
00:17:05,774 --> 00:17:08,402
and at this point,
I think it's time to regroup.

224
00:17:09,945 --> 00:17:13,699
I made a promise to him,
and he's trusting me to--

225
00:17:13,782 --> 00:17:14,908
It's my decision.

226
00:17:14,992 --> 00:17:16,493
That's all for today's meeting.

227
00:17:17,202 --> 00:17:18,954
- Okay.
- Yes, sir.

228
00:17:20,539 --> 00:17:22,332
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

229
00:17:34,678 --> 00:17:37,639
Is it because
you have feelings for that someone?

230
00:17:37,723 --> 00:17:40,768
Yes, I think so.

231
00:17:52,654 --> 00:17:54,198
MS. JEONG HA-NA

232
00:18:00,579 --> 00:18:03,207
MR. BONG CHEOL-HUI

233
00:18:09,421 --> 00:18:10,714
Ms. Jeong?

234
00:18:11,840 --> 00:18:13,467
Are you coming to lunch with us?

235
00:18:14,635 --> 00:18:16,720
She probably has no appetite.

236
00:18:16,804 --> 00:18:18,388
Let's just go.

237
00:18:19,098 --> 00:18:21,308
We'll see you later then.

238
00:18:21,391 --> 00:18:22,351
Okay.

239
00:18:33,195 --> 00:18:37,324
What do I like?
What's a good match for me?

240
00:18:37,407 --> 00:18:38,659
I want to find out.

241
00:18:39,326 --> 00:18:40,994
So I'd like you to help me.

242
00:18:41,787 --> 00:18:44,998
That's the after-sales service I want.

243
00:19:07,729 --> 00:19:08,814
Where's the sauce?

244
00:19:13,694 --> 00:19:14,736
Cheol-hui?

245
00:19:14,820 --> 00:19:15,654
Yes?

246
00:19:16,321 --> 00:19:17,573
Ha-na, you're here.

247
00:19:19,491 --> 00:19:20,909
Don't you see me?

248
00:19:20,993 --> 00:19:22,119
Hey.

249
00:19:23,287 --> 00:19:25,873
Cheol-hui, did you take care
of that urgent matter?

250
00:19:27,124 --> 00:19:28,709
Yes.

251
00:19:31,420 --> 00:19:32,671
Is it a slow work day?

252
00:19:35,757 --> 00:19:38,552
No. There's a crisis.

253
00:19:39,178 --> 00:19:41,555
What is it?
Did Choi Gi-jun give you a hard time?

254
00:19:43,056 --> 00:19:44,725
Did Mr. Choi give you a hard time?

255
00:19:44,808 --> 00:19:46,560
Do you want me to rough him up?

256
00:19:46,643 --> 00:19:48,145
Will you?

257
00:19:48,228 --> 00:19:50,147
Hold on a second.

258
00:19:50,230 --> 00:19:51,899
Let me grab my tools.

259
00:19:55,986 --> 00:19:57,362
Cheol-hui.

260
00:19:59,656 --> 00:20:04,369
I'm afraid I won't be able
to manage your case for a while.

261
00:20:05,037 --> 00:20:06,747
- What?
- Why?

262
00:20:07,581 --> 00:20:08,957
The thing is…

263
00:20:09,917 --> 00:20:12,586
Ms. Lee managed a case
before going on maternity leave.

264
00:20:12,669 --> 00:20:14,171
I was told to handle that first.

265
00:20:15,422 --> 00:20:17,299
Choi Gi-jun gave me the order.

266
00:20:17,382 --> 00:20:20,594
You're not the only person on that team.

267
00:20:20,677 --> 00:20:22,512
What's wrong with him?

268
00:20:22,596 --> 00:20:24,598
You're the one who persuaded me to come!

269
00:20:24,681 --> 00:20:26,767
It was a huge decision
to leave the island!

270
00:20:26,850 --> 00:20:28,977
What about the twins? What about my life?

271
00:20:29,061 --> 00:20:30,979
I can't believe this!

272
00:20:31,063 --> 00:20:33,065
This isn't a morale boost! It's a scam!

273
00:20:33,148 --> 00:20:34,983
This is just a scam, isn't it? Why…

274
00:20:43,492 --> 00:20:48,121
I'm afraid Choi Gi-jun will manage you
for the time being.

275
00:20:49,623 --> 00:20:50,999
Mr. Choi?

276
00:20:54,253 --> 00:20:56,797
- You're really leaving?
- Yes.

277
00:21:18,193 --> 00:21:19,236
Excuse me?

278
00:21:19,319 --> 00:21:20,529
I'll be right there!

279
00:21:28,996 --> 00:21:30,580
- Cheol-hui?
- Yes?

280
00:21:31,248 --> 00:21:33,250
What are you thinking about?

281
00:21:33,834 --> 00:21:35,335
Nothing much.

282
00:21:35,419 --> 00:21:38,672
I was thinking of which tool to use
to rough up Mr. Choi.

283
00:21:38,755 --> 00:21:41,675
Which one would scare him the most?

284
00:21:43,927 --> 00:21:46,096
In any case, you have to focus.

285
00:21:46,179 --> 00:21:49,224
It may not seem like it,
but I always keep promises.

286
00:21:49,308 --> 00:21:51,351
I promise to take care of you, Cheol-hui.

287
00:21:54,271 --> 00:21:56,398
THE DYAN PRINCESS
WHO USED THE ISLAND BACHELOR

288
00:21:56,898 --> 00:21:58,984
DID OH IN-A DATE AN AVERAGE
CITIZEN TO BOOST HER IMAGE?

289
00:22:05,657 --> 00:22:08,035
You must be heartbroken.

290
00:22:08,702 --> 00:22:12,164
It's not easy for two people
to connect with each other right away

291
00:22:12,247 --> 00:22:14,041
on the first try.

292
00:22:15,876 --> 00:22:16,960
You mean me?

293
00:22:17,627 --> 00:22:20,005
I'm not that upset.

294
00:22:20,088 --> 00:22:24,593
I know you're wearing sunglasses
to hide your puffy eyes.

295
00:22:25,177 --> 00:22:26,762
No, you got it wrong.

296
00:22:26,845 --> 00:22:29,723
I ate ramyeon last night, so…

297
00:22:31,516 --> 00:22:35,145
I'm not the type who gets low-spirited
over something like this.

298
00:22:35,228 --> 00:22:36,897
I knew it.

299
00:22:36,980 --> 00:22:40,233
You're as strong as the size of Dyan.

300
00:22:41,860 --> 00:22:44,571
You're here
for the project sponsorship, right?

301
00:22:46,448 --> 00:22:48,158
Are you afraid I might withdraw it?

302
00:22:48,241 --> 00:22:50,744
I'm sure you won't, but…

303
00:22:52,412 --> 00:22:54,790
Ms. Jeong Ha-na is in charge of me,

304
00:22:55,749 --> 00:22:59,836
but you're here instead,
so the reason is rather predictable.

305
00:23:00,378 --> 00:23:02,339
There's the sponsorship matter,

306
00:23:02,422 --> 00:23:06,468
but Ms. Jeong was suddenly put in charge
of a wedding preparation case,

307
00:23:06,551 --> 00:23:09,888
so that's why I reached out
to check in with you.

308
00:23:10,722 --> 00:23:12,349
A wedding preparation case?

309
00:23:12,432 --> 00:23:15,268
Out of all the couples
that our team matched,

310
00:23:15,352 --> 00:23:17,813
they're the first who will get married.

311
00:23:17,896 --> 00:23:19,523
I see.

312
00:23:19,606 --> 00:23:23,568
You can say this is the result
of all of my hard work.

313
00:23:26,822 --> 00:23:29,199
I should've been
the first one to get married.

314
00:23:29,991 --> 00:23:34,162
Well, Ms. Oh,
it's definitely possible for you too.

315
00:23:34,246 --> 00:23:37,582
I'll make every effort
to make that happen.

316
00:23:39,459 --> 00:23:40,418
In that case…

317
00:23:41,002 --> 00:23:42,212
In that case?

318
00:23:44,172 --> 00:23:46,716
I'll add product sponsorship as well.

319
00:23:47,467 --> 00:23:50,595
Dyan Mart will provide
all the newlywed furnishings

320
00:23:50,679 --> 00:23:52,973
for the first couple.

321
00:23:54,850 --> 00:23:56,017
If I do that,

322
00:23:57,644 --> 00:23:59,813
will they see my innocent intentions?

323
00:24:02,649 --> 00:24:05,026
Why yes, of course!

324
00:24:05,110 --> 00:24:07,028
We'll put out lots of positive articles.

325
00:24:07,112 --> 00:24:08,530
- Really?
- Yes.

326
00:24:08,613 --> 00:24:09,948
- Lots of them?
- Yes.

327
00:24:10,532 --> 00:24:11,700
Cheers.

328
00:24:29,092 --> 00:24:30,260
Mr. Kim Jun-wu?

329
00:24:31,928 --> 00:24:32,929
Yes?

330
00:24:35,265 --> 00:24:36,099
Ms. Lee Yeo-reum?

331
00:24:36,683 --> 00:24:38,059
Yes?

332
00:24:39,936 --> 00:24:41,938
You two really must be busy.

333
00:24:43,315 --> 00:24:44,482
No, we're not.

334
00:24:47,277 --> 00:24:49,863
I got a call from work.

335
00:24:49,946 --> 00:24:50,906
I'm sorry.

336
00:24:50,989 --> 00:24:54,492
You do plan on getting married, right?

337
00:24:54,576 --> 00:24:56,077
Yes, of course.

338
00:24:56,161 --> 00:24:59,623
We're both very busy
and can't find time to see each other,

339
00:24:59,706 --> 00:25:01,958
so we decided to get married
and live together.

340
00:25:02,584 --> 00:25:06,046
Few men are understanding
of women who work a lot.

341
00:25:06,129 --> 00:25:09,758
But Jun-wu says he'll respect my lifestyle
even after we get married.

342
00:25:09,841 --> 00:25:11,092
Of course, I will.

343
00:25:14,554 --> 00:25:17,807
You two seem sincere
about wanting to get married.

344
00:25:17,891 --> 00:25:18,892
Of course, we are.

345
00:25:19,809 --> 00:25:24,231
But to get married,
we have to prepare for a wedding

346
00:25:24,314 --> 00:25:26,483
and find furniture for our new home.

347
00:25:26,566 --> 00:25:28,109
There's just so much to do.

348
00:25:28,193 --> 00:25:30,737
You're right. There's a lot to do.

349
00:25:31,571 --> 00:25:34,616
It's good that you took
your wedding photos ahead of time.

350
00:25:34,699 --> 00:25:37,577
I'm already grateful
you helped me find Yeo-reum,

351
00:25:37,661 --> 00:25:40,080
but I didn't know you'd help
with wedding preparations.

352
00:25:40,664 --> 00:25:43,375
Do you have experience
in this by any chance?

353
00:25:44,542 --> 00:25:47,754
Does calling off a wedding
count as experience?

354
00:25:48,880 --> 00:25:52,008
I worked at a matchmaking agency before.

355
00:25:53,802 --> 00:25:58,056
It's our first time doing this,
so we're not sure where to start.

356
00:25:59,182 --> 00:26:03,228
If you send us some options,
we'll get back to you right away.

357
00:26:03,937 --> 00:26:05,605
Okay.

358
00:26:06,189 --> 00:26:07,399
Yes, sir?

359
00:26:08,525 --> 00:26:09,567
Just a minute.

360
00:26:10,318 --> 00:26:12,070
Is it okay to go now?

361
00:26:13,613 --> 00:26:15,573
Thank you. Please contact us.

362
00:26:18,660 --> 00:26:21,246
Okay. I'll take care of things.

363
00:26:21,329 --> 00:26:23,081
I understand, sir.

364
00:26:24,165 --> 00:26:25,667
I'll send it over right now.

365
00:26:28,878 --> 00:26:30,297
They told me to do everything.

366
00:26:36,761 --> 00:26:39,014
NEWLYWED HOUSE PROSPECTS

367
00:26:39,097 --> 00:26:41,266
NEWLYWED FURNISHINGS

368
00:26:43,143 --> 00:26:46,146
I never thought
I'd have to prepare a wedding again.

369
00:26:47,147 --> 00:26:48,732
This feels strange.

370
00:26:52,193 --> 00:26:54,446
It's a process
where you share your choices

371
00:26:55,071 --> 00:26:57,240
and piece them together one by one.

372
00:26:59,159 --> 00:27:02,454
It's the first gateway to marriage

373
00:27:02,537 --> 00:27:04,039
as well as the first test.

374
00:27:06,291 --> 00:27:10,045
Yes. I think it's best if I don't do this.

375
00:27:23,892 --> 00:27:25,101
What's wrong?

376
00:27:25,185 --> 00:27:26,811
I don't know.

377
00:27:26,895 --> 00:27:30,023
I think I have a neck cramp.

378
00:27:30,106 --> 00:27:31,149
A neck cramp?

379
00:27:31,232 --> 00:27:33,109
Do kids get neck cramps?

380
00:27:33,193 --> 00:27:36,988
When uncle woke up one morning,

381
00:27:37,072 --> 00:27:40,116
he couldn't move his neck
and said it was a cramp.

382
00:27:40,200 --> 00:27:43,578
You shouldn't have burst your pillow then.

383
00:27:44,829 --> 00:27:48,041
Uncle will buy one for me today, right?

384
00:27:48,124 --> 00:27:50,919
Yes. He said he had time today.

385
00:27:51,461 --> 00:27:55,298
While he's at it, should we ask him
to get one for Ha-na too?

386
00:27:56,257 --> 00:27:59,761
Don't you think you're moving too fast?

387
00:27:59,844 --> 00:28:01,596
We need to help them out.

388
00:28:01,679 --> 00:28:04,265
If we don't, this drama won't be fun.

389
00:28:13,691 --> 00:28:15,693
Ms. Jeong, you're really something.

390
00:28:15,777 --> 00:28:18,238
You've already completed this report.

391
00:28:18,321 --> 00:28:20,281
It's like you've done it before.

392
00:28:21,783 --> 00:28:23,118
Don't you agree, Mr. Choi?

393
00:28:23,201 --> 00:28:25,620
What? I suppose…

394
00:28:27,455 --> 00:28:32,669
Oh, I got Dyan to provide
all of the newlywed furnishings.

395
00:28:32,752 --> 00:28:35,171
So they can get whatever they want.

396
00:28:35,255 --> 00:28:40,176
Okay. I'll make sure the couple knows
it's all thanks to your hard effort.

397
00:28:41,720 --> 00:28:44,639
Let's give Ms. Oh the credit
since she probably doesn't feel good.

398
00:28:46,433 --> 00:28:49,644
Yes, you're right.

399
00:28:53,648 --> 00:28:55,358
I'll be out on business for a bit.

400
00:29:16,171 --> 00:29:18,131
They'd like the ceremony
on Saturday 1:00 p.m.

401
00:29:18,214 --> 00:29:19,466
Is there an available date?

402
00:29:19,549 --> 00:29:21,760
There will be 200 guests.

403
00:29:22,844 --> 00:29:25,305
There's one date left
on the third week of next month.

404
00:29:25,388 --> 00:29:28,475
I'll ask the couple
and get back to you then.

405
00:29:28,558 --> 00:29:29,517
Okay.

406
00:29:30,435 --> 00:29:31,561
Here's my business card.

407
00:29:32,812 --> 00:29:35,148
INJEONG CITY
JEONG HA-NA

408
00:29:35,231 --> 00:29:37,484
I thought you were a wedding planner.

409
00:29:39,527 --> 00:29:43,656
Let's say I'm performing a public duty
to help couples with wedding planning.

410
00:29:44,783 --> 00:29:46,367
- Shall we go?
- Yes.

411
00:29:50,038 --> 00:29:51,498
- Take care.
- Thank you.

412
00:29:56,878 --> 00:29:58,046
Hello?

413
00:29:58,588 --> 00:30:01,633
Ms. Lee, does this mean
you like the wedding hall?

414
00:30:01,716 --> 00:30:04,010
Yes, and the date is perfect.

415
00:30:04,093 --> 00:30:05,762
Jun-wu agrees too.

416
00:30:05,845 --> 00:30:07,263
That's good to hear.

417
00:30:07,347 --> 00:30:10,934
I'll video call you in an hour
for the dress tour then, right?

418
00:30:11,810 --> 00:30:14,020
I have a meeting with a vendor right now.

419
00:30:14,103 --> 00:30:16,689
Can I ask you to do
something else instead?

420
00:30:17,816 --> 00:30:19,067
What would that be?

421
00:30:39,420 --> 00:30:41,589
Are you here to look at some bedding, sir?

422
00:30:42,257 --> 00:30:43,716
Yes, that's right.

423
00:30:43,800 --> 00:30:47,720
There's a new mattress
that would go great with that.

424
00:30:47,804 --> 00:30:51,391
There's a new arrival promotion
where you can get 30% off.

425
00:30:52,016 --> 00:30:54,269
- A mattress?
- Yes.

426
00:30:54,352 --> 00:30:55,603
Please follow me.

427
00:31:01,067 --> 00:31:02,485
This is it.

428
00:31:02,569 --> 00:31:06,239
It's especially popular
among newlywed customers.

429
00:31:06,906 --> 00:31:09,033
- Really?
- Yes.

430
00:31:09,534 --> 00:31:11,035
Why don't you lie down?

431
00:31:11,119 --> 00:31:13,872
It'll feel like you're floating on clouds.

432
00:31:13,955 --> 00:31:17,750
I lay down here once
and almost slept until the end of the day.

433
00:31:19,961 --> 00:31:22,338
- If you don't mind, I'll try it out then.
- Okay.

434
00:31:24,048 --> 00:31:25,800
Wow, this seems great.

435
00:31:26,968 --> 00:31:27,927
It's soft, right?

436
00:31:28,011 --> 00:31:29,095
Excuse me?

437
00:31:29,178 --> 00:31:30,221
I'm coming!

438
00:31:30,722 --> 00:31:32,974
- Please take your time then.
- Okay.

439
00:31:40,690 --> 00:31:44,402
It's so fluffy. I have to admit it's nice.

440
00:32:03,087 --> 00:32:04,464
Hi, honey.

441
00:32:05,131 --> 00:32:06,174
Hi.

442
00:32:06,758 --> 00:32:08,176
Wake up.

443
00:32:10,637 --> 00:32:11,846
Honey.

444
00:32:11,930 --> 00:32:13,056
Honey.

445
00:32:15,016 --> 00:32:16,100
Hey there.

446
00:32:16,935 --> 00:32:18,227
Wake up.

447
00:32:25,860 --> 00:32:29,113
Ha-na, are you okay?

448
00:32:29,197 --> 00:32:30,531
I think I hit you hard.

449
00:32:30,615 --> 00:32:32,450
No, I'm okay.

450
00:32:32,533 --> 00:32:35,787
- I'm so sorry.
- It's really okay.

451
00:32:36,537 --> 00:32:38,581
But what brings you here?

452
00:32:38,665 --> 00:32:39,832
What?

453
00:32:41,000 --> 00:32:44,295
I'm here to buy the twins some pillows.

454
00:32:44,379 --> 00:32:46,297
But what brings you here, Ha-na?

455
00:32:46,381 --> 00:32:49,258
Shouldn't you be at work?

456
00:32:49,342 --> 00:32:54,222
Oh, I'm here to take care
of the urgent case I told you about.

457
00:32:54,305 --> 00:32:57,600
The "first matched couple
wedding planning support project."

458
00:32:57,684 --> 00:33:00,269
They asked me
to check the size of this bed.

459
00:33:01,104 --> 00:33:02,105
I see.

460
00:33:05,817 --> 00:33:06,651
Cheol-hui.

461
00:33:08,444 --> 00:33:09,904
Are you busy right now?

462
00:33:11,280 --> 00:33:12,532
Me? Right now?

463
00:33:13,366 --> 00:33:17,662
No, I'm not really busy. Why?

464
00:33:32,010 --> 00:33:33,261
To be honest,

465
00:33:34,303 --> 00:33:37,140
I didn't feel comfortable
coming here alone.

466
00:33:38,891 --> 00:33:40,268
It reminded me of the past.

467
00:33:43,062 --> 00:33:45,648
But I also wanted to get over it.

468
00:33:46,607 --> 00:33:48,234
I didn't do anything wrong,

469
00:33:48,317 --> 00:33:50,737
so I shouldn't feel
traumatized by wedding dresses.

470
00:33:53,156 --> 00:33:55,700
Ha-na, you're really amazing.

471
00:33:55,783 --> 00:33:59,245
Not everyone can get over
a traumatic ordeal on their own.

472
00:34:01,748 --> 00:34:03,416
I tried to hide.

473
00:34:05,710 --> 00:34:10,173
But you got a satisfying slap
as well as a settlement.

474
00:34:10,256 --> 00:34:11,591
I knew right then.

475
00:34:14,010 --> 00:34:16,179
- I'm pretty cool, right?
- Yes.

476
00:34:17,722 --> 00:34:21,059
Since you're cool,
you should wear a tuxedo.

477
00:34:21,726 --> 00:34:22,602
And I…

478
00:34:27,732 --> 00:34:29,233
I'll try a Cheongdo mermaid look.

479
00:34:29,317 --> 00:34:31,486
What do you think? Does it look good?

480
00:34:31,569 --> 00:34:32,945
Under the sea

481
00:34:33,738 --> 00:34:35,031
It looks perfect on you.

482
00:34:36,991 --> 00:34:38,367
Are you done selecting?

483
00:34:38,451 --> 00:34:41,079
Let me video call the bride right now.

484
00:34:41,162 --> 00:34:42,497
Sure.

485
00:34:47,627 --> 00:34:48,878
CONNECTING

486
00:34:49,504 --> 00:34:50,713
We're connected now.

487
00:34:50,797 --> 00:34:53,466
Let me go ahead and show you the dresses.

488
00:34:53,549 --> 00:34:54,675
- Okay.
- Okay.

489
00:34:54,759 --> 00:34:56,761
Cheol-hui, can you show this one?

490
00:34:58,054 --> 00:34:59,097
Okay.

491
00:35:02,016 --> 00:35:03,810
Here's number one.

492
00:35:03,893 --> 00:35:06,104
It has a puffed sleeve design.

493
00:35:07,563 --> 00:35:09,107
I can't see it well.

494
00:35:10,108 --> 00:35:11,859
- Can you lift it up a bit?
- Okay.

495
00:35:14,737 --> 00:35:16,531
Okay. What about the next one?

496
00:35:18,407 --> 00:35:19,951
This is number two.

497
00:35:20,034 --> 00:35:22,787
This has a simple sleeveless design.

498
00:35:27,750 --> 00:35:29,961
Let's show her number three.

499
00:35:33,798 --> 00:35:36,134
The third one is
an off-the-shoulder dress.

500
00:35:36,217 --> 00:35:37,969
- I like number three.
- Me too.

501
00:35:38,052 --> 00:35:40,888
Ms. Jeong,
I think the third one will work.

502
00:35:40,972 --> 00:35:43,599
Do you think you can try it on for me?

503
00:35:43,683 --> 00:35:45,434
I'm curious to see
what it looks like on a person.

504
00:35:46,644 --> 00:35:47,854
Me?

505
00:35:47,937 --> 00:35:52,358
We have similar physiques,
so it'll help me know for sure.

506
00:35:52,441 --> 00:35:55,486
Would you mind trying on a tuxedo too?

507
00:35:57,989 --> 00:35:59,615
Tuxedo? Do you mean me?

508
00:36:05,746 --> 00:36:06,873
Ha-na, the size is…

509
00:36:17,216 --> 00:36:18,259
What do you think?

510
00:36:21,012 --> 00:36:22,513
You don't like it?

511
00:36:23,723 --> 00:36:24,765
What?

512
00:36:26,726 --> 00:36:27,602
Cheol-hui?

513
00:36:28,603 --> 00:36:29,854
It's pretty.

514
00:36:31,355 --> 00:36:32,982
It'll look good on Ms. Lee, right?

515
00:36:33,566 --> 00:36:35,067
You're pretty, Ha-na.

516
00:36:36,068 --> 00:36:39,113
You look good too.
You wanted a compliment, right?

517
00:36:41,824 --> 00:36:44,744
Excuse me, but may we take a photo?

518
00:36:44,827 --> 00:36:48,623
I think it'll help my clients
if they see this through a photo.

519
00:36:48,706 --> 00:36:50,833
Taking photos is generally prohibited,

520
00:36:51,459 --> 00:36:54,587
but you look great together,
so I'll take one for you as a keepsake.

521
00:37:02,386 --> 00:37:03,429
Okay.

522
00:37:06,682 --> 00:37:08,643
One, two, three.

523
00:37:12,230 --> 00:37:14,148
You must be newlyweds.

524
00:37:14,232 --> 00:37:16,234
I can't believe
how good you look together.

525
00:37:16,317 --> 00:37:18,486
It's not like that.

526
00:37:18,569 --> 00:37:20,738
He's acting as a proxy for the groom.

527
00:37:24,158 --> 00:37:26,410
Right. We're not a newlywed couple.

528
00:37:27,745 --> 00:37:29,205
It's this house right here.

529
00:37:29,288 --> 00:37:32,500
I'll wait outside,
so take your time looking around.

530
00:37:32,583 --> 00:37:33,834
- Okay.
- Okay.

531
00:38:06,951 --> 00:38:08,869
I like this place.

532
00:38:09,912 --> 00:38:11,330
Really?

533
00:38:11,414 --> 00:38:13,666
Your expression tells me you don't.

534
00:38:14,959 --> 00:38:17,253
I think Mr. Kim will like it,

535
00:38:17,336 --> 00:38:19,255
but Ms. Lee said she prefers apartments.

536
00:38:19,338 --> 00:38:22,008
They still haven't come to an agreement?

537
00:38:23,092 --> 00:38:26,429
They want a room big enough
to push two beds together,

538
00:38:26,512 --> 00:38:28,389
but they haven't yet decided on
a house or apartment.

539
00:38:30,683 --> 00:38:31,684
What about you?

540
00:38:32,768 --> 00:38:35,146
Me? I like apartments.

541
00:38:36,355 --> 00:38:38,733
They're easy to manage
and have many amenities.

542
00:38:40,234 --> 00:38:42,737
I really like houses like this one.

543
00:38:43,654 --> 00:38:47,450
You can have a barbecue in the yard
and look at the stars. Isn't that great?

544
00:38:47,533 --> 00:38:49,618
Think about having to clean this place.

545
00:38:49,702 --> 00:38:51,037
You can't rest on weekends.

546
00:38:52,621 --> 00:38:55,374
You know the meaning of romance, right?

547
00:38:55,458 --> 00:38:56,959
I don't know what that is.

548
00:38:57,918 --> 00:38:59,754
I'm checking out the other rooms.

549
00:39:12,975 --> 00:39:15,936
This is where
Ms. Lee really wanted me to check out.

550
00:39:16,020 --> 00:39:17,188
I see.

551
00:39:17,271 --> 00:39:18,522
That's Building 101.

552
00:39:18,606 --> 00:39:20,066
The location is good, right?

553
00:39:20,149 --> 00:39:21,650
Right. Building 101.

554
00:39:24,070 --> 00:39:26,405
Ma'am, Building 101 is a quick sale.

555
00:39:26,489 --> 00:39:28,240
We can look at it first, right?

556
00:39:28,324 --> 00:39:29,784
Of course, ma'am.

557
00:39:38,125 --> 00:39:39,668
Ha-na, hold my hand.

558
00:40:24,130 --> 00:40:28,217
I'm so sorry to do this!

559
00:41:03,711 --> 00:41:06,130
We're here! Building 101!

560
00:41:06,213 --> 00:41:07,506
We did it!

561
00:41:08,591 --> 00:41:10,009
We did it!

562
00:41:19,852 --> 00:41:21,896
What in the world is going on?

563
00:41:21,979 --> 00:41:23,063
Let's go in now.

564
00:41:35,910 --> 00:41:37,953
What made you do something nice like that?

565
00:41:38,537 --> 00:41:39,997
Expanding the sponsorship?

566
00:41:41,540 --> 00:41:42,750
You know me.

567
00:41:43,667 --> 00:41:45,085
I did it for myself.

568
00:41:47,963 --> 00:41:48,881
Are you depressed?

569
00:41:50,299 --> 00:41:51,425
Do you feel better now?

570
00:41:52,927 --> 00:41:53,969
No.

571
00:41:56,889 --> 00:41:58,766
Recovery is taking longer than I thought.

572
00:42:03,187 --> 00:42:04,396
Speaking of which…

573
00:42:06,690 --> 00:42:07,900
Why? What is it?

574
00:42:10,236 --> 00:42:11,654
No.

575
00:42:12,821 --> 00:42:14,365
Seriously. Not today.

576
00:42:15,950 --> 00:42:18,661
Why not? You like that movie too.

577
00:42:19,954 --> 00:42:22,915
Oh In-a's getting-over-a-heartbreak
project has started again.

578
00:42:22,998 --> 00:42:26,961
You watch the same movie
over and over again after a breakup.

579
00:42:27,044 --> 00:42:29,588
At this point, I've memorized
the main character's lines.

580
00:42:31,799 --> 00:42:34,301
It's the only thing that comforts me.

581
00:42:38,013 --> 00:42:39,473
I wish I could erase

582
00:42:39,557 --> 00:42:42,393
Cheol-hui from my mind like in the movie.

583
00:42:43,310 --> 00:42:44,311
Right?

584
00:42:45,563 --> 00:42:47,314
I disagree.

585
00:42:47,398 --> 00:42:50,693
I want to keep every memory,
even the sad ones.

586
00:42:53,112 --> 00:42:56,031
Even if I have to give up on Ha-na…

587
00:42:58,450 --> 00:43:00,786
The time I spent with Ha-na is something

588
00:43:02,329 --> 00:43:03,664
I don't want to forget.

589
00:43:07,960 --> 00:43:09,837
You're right.

590
00:43:11,964 --> 00:43:14,383
To be honest, I feel the same way.

591
00:43:15,426 --> 00:43:16,969
This is so sad.

592
00:43:18,554 --> 00:43:19,680
Goodness.

593
00:43:21,140 --> 00:43:22,808
I'm about to cry.

594
00:43:26,228 --> 00:43:27,771
Okay, I got it. Just stop.

595
00:43:29,106 --> 00:43:30,149
I knew it.

596
00:43:31,483 --> 00:43:34,111
You're all I've got, buddy.

597
00:43:46,123 --> 00:43:48,000
How was it today?

598
00:43:48,083 --> 00:43:51,754
I finished planning my wedding in my head.

599
00:43:52,588 --> 00:43:54,632
You don't plan a wedding on your own.

600
00:43:54,715 --> 00:43:56,800
It's something you do with your partner.

601
00:43:57,509 --> 00:44:00,387
Think of it as
the first gateway to marriage.

602
00:44:01,639 --> 00:44:03,932
People lead separate lives for decades.

603
00:44:04,016 --> 00:44:06,727
Imagine how much effort it'd take
for them to live together.

604
00:44:07,686 --> 00:44:12,399
So, Ha-na, do you think that's difficult?

605
00:44:14,943 --> 00:44:16,737
I think it's uncomfortable.

606
00:44:17,529 --> 00:44:19,615
That's why I think
it's better to live alone.

607
00:44:21,450 --> 00:44:25,371
But it might be a different story
if I share similar tastes with someone.

608
00:44:27,373 --> 00:44:31,126
So how do you feel when you're with me?

609
00:44:31,210 --> 00:44:32,127
Are you comfortable?

610
00:44:33,295 --> 00:44:35,172
It's fun when I'm with you.

611
00:44:35,255 --> 00:44:36,882
We have the same sense of humor.

612
00:44:38,342 --> 00:44:41,804
I was so glad to run into you
at the furniture store earlier.

613
00:44:41,887 --> 00:44:43,305
That's all that matters then.

614
00:44:48,477 --> 00:44:49,770
Ha-na!

615
00:44:50,896 --> 00:44:52,106
Hurry up and come here!

616
00:44:54,233 --> 00:44:56,318
Maybe that's why I had that dream.

617
00:44:58,445 --> 00:45:01,281
What did you dream about?

618
00:45:02,408 --> 00:45:04,368
It's nothing. Go inside!

619
00:45:04,451 --> 00:45:05,661
Okay.

620
00:45:29,059 --> 00:45:31,061
- Are you home?
- You're back.

621
00:45:43,115 --> 00:45:44,450
Why are you like this again?

622
00:45:44,533 --> 00:45:46,660
Uncle, your face is red.

623
00:45:46,743 --> 00:45:48,912
What if something bad happens?

624
00:45:48,996 --> 00:45:50,539
I know, right?

625
00:45:51,582 --> 00:45:52,749
What's this?

626
00:45:52,833 --> 00:45:53,917
What is it?

627
00:46:03,343 --> 00:46:04,553
Geez.

628
00:46:06,763 --> 00:46:10,017
It's been more than ten years
since you debuted.

629
00:46:10,100 --> 00:46:14,646
Su-ji, you've had no dating rumors
until this sudden marriage announcement.

630
00:46:14,730 --> 00:46:18,025
It's to the point where people thought
it was an April Fool's prank.

631
00:46:18,108 --> 00:46:19,359
What are your thoughts?

632
00:46:19,443 --> 00:46:22,279
Until I entered the wedding hall,

633
00:46:22,362 --> 00:46:25,282
I wondered if I was being punked.

634
00:46:26,825 --> 00:46:31,455
So what made you decide
to get married all of a sudden?

635
00:46:32,414 --> 00:46:35,876
You can have different tastes
in genres or music.

636
00:46:35,959 --> 00:46:40,255
But if your laughing
and crying points are the same,

637
00:46:40,339 --> 00:46:42,633
a short film can become a feature film.

638
00:46:43,425 --> 00:46:45,385
Laughing and crying points?

639
00:46:46,136 --> 00:46:48,347
You can just become my partner.

640
00:46:48,430 --> 00:46:49,306
What?

641
00:46:51,642 --> 00:46:54,353
"We're getting married."
Didn't you say that?

642
00:46:54,436 --> 00:46:56,104
Stop teasing me already!

643
00:46:56,188 --> 00:46:58,524
- What? That is what you said.
- Unbelievable.

644
00:46:58,607 --> 00:47:00,442
You said we were getting married.

645
00:47:00,526 --> 00:47:02,194
We linked arms and everything.

646
00:47:02,277 --> 00:47:05,864
How does a car say goodbye?

647
00:47:06,532 --> 00:47:08,909
- How does a car say goodbye?
- Yes.

648
00:47:08,992 --> 00:47:09,910
Oil be seeing you!

649
00:47:13,664 --> 00:47:15,457
Try this.

650
00:47:19,711 --> 00:47:21,213
I'll try a Cheongdo mermaid look.

651
00:47:21,296 --> 00:47:23,340
What do you think? Does it look good?

652
00:47:23,423 --> 00:47:25,133
Under the sea

653
00:47:25,717 --> 00:47:31,598
We not only have
the same laughing and crying points,

654
00:47:31,682 --> 00:47:34,518
but our boiling points are the same,

655
00:47:34,601 --> 00:47:37,437
and our moral boundaries are similar.

656
00:47:43,110 --> 00:47:46,280
It really upset me,
so I went to see my boyfriend.

657
00:47:46,363 --> 00:47:48,115
I found him cheating on me.

658
00:47:50,576 --> 00:47:51,952
See you next time.

659
00:47:52,035 --> 00:47:53,954
I doubt it.

660
00:47:58,083 --> 00:47:59,543
I'm against this match.

661
00:47:59,626 --> 00:48:01,712
I can't send you off to her.

662
00:48:03,964 --> 00:48:07,593
How can you remember a sad past
for centuries and millenniums?

663
00:48:09,219 --> 00:48:11,930
There must be an expiry date
for the pain too.

664
00:48:17,060 --> 00:48:21,982
So we understand the range of our emotions
and can better empathize with each other,

665
00:48:22,065 --> 00:48:24,776
which means
we fit well together in that sense.

666
00:48:25,944 --> 00:48:28,739
It has be to be that way
in a relationship.

667
00:48:28,822 --> 00:48:30,115
Ha-na.

668
00:48:30,991 --> 00:48:32,242
I have something to say.

669
00:48:35,120 --> 00:48:36,079
Let's…

670
00:48:39,249 --> 00:48:40,792
Let's meet tomorrow.

671
00:48:42,836 --> 00:48:44,880
HA-NA

672
00:48:56,350 --> 00:48:58,685
- Excuse me, Mr. Han.
- Yes, sir?

673
00:48:59,603 --> 00:49:00,896
What's that?

674
00:49:00,979 --> 00:49:04,524
That box came for Ms. Jeong,
but I don't know what it is.

675
00:49:05,108 --> 00:49:08,945
What? They're supposed
to sign the contract today.

676
00:49:09,029 --> 00:49:10,656
They haven't arrived?

677
00:49:10,739 --> 00:49:13,325
Let me check and get back to you.

678
00:49:13,408 --> 00:49:14,326
Okay.

679
00:49:18,538 --> 00:49:19,790
It's here.

680
00:49:28,382 --> 00:49:30,425
These are for Mr. Kim and Ms. Lee.

681
00:49:33,595 --> 00:49:37,099
KIM JUN-WU AND LEE YEO-REUM

682
00:49:40,018 --> 00:49:43,105
- It's because of you!
- We're here. Just stop.

683
00:49:47,734 --> 00:49:50,737
I was about to call you.

684
00:49:52,364 --> 00:49:54,074
Your invitations arrived.

685
00:49:54,157 --> 00:49:55,450
Aren't they pretty?

686
00:49:56,159 --> 00:49:58,036
We have something to tell you.

687
00:49:59,121 --> 00:50:00,080
Excuse me?

688
00:50:00,163 --> 00:50:02,082
- The wedding is off.
- The wedding is off.

689
00:50:07,254 --> 00:50:10,006
Where is this coming from?

690
00:50:10,549 --> 00:50:15,011
You said you're really compatible
and that you're a fantastic couple.

691
00:50:15,971 --> 00:50:17,347
Fantastic?

692
00:50:17,431 --> 00:50:19,099
Crazy is more like it.

693
00:50:21,643 --> 00:50:23,145
I should be the one saying that.

694
00:50:35,574 --> 00:50:38,660
If you can just explain to me
what the problem is--

695
00:50:38,744 --> 00:50:40,537
Listen to me.

696
00:50:41,204 --> 00:50:44,082
We had already decided on
a dowry and wedding gifts.

697
00:50:45,625 --> 00:50:48,211
Wedding gifts are a common problem.

698
00:50:48,295 --> 00:50:51,256
It's the first obstacle to overcome
when planning a wedding.

699
00:50:51,840 --> 00:50:53,508
We can't help with wedding gifts.

700
00:50:57,471 --> 00:50:59,890
Because we were rushing to get married,

701
00:50:59,973 --> 00:51:02,225
we agreed not to give each other anything.

702
00:51:03,268 --> 00:51:05,645
But it's a once in a lifetime event.

703
00:51:05,729 --> 00:51:08,815
I suggested giving each other
reasonable gifts as a token.

704
00:51:08,899 --> 00:51:11,318
Right, so that's what we decided to do.

705
00:51:12,110 --> 00:51:12,944
Excuse me?

706
00:51:14,613 --> 00:51:16,907
I hate going back on promises,

707
00:51:16,990 --> 00:51:19,159
but I didn't want to be petty over money.

708
00:51:19,743 --> 00:51:21,411
So then why…

709
00:51:21,495 --> 00:51:22,746
It's because of Gyeo-wul.

710
00:51:24,247 --> 00:51:25,499
Gyeo-wul?

711
00:51:26,208 --> 00:51:29,419
I actually have a dog.

712
00:51:29,503 --> 00:51:30,796
His name is Gyeo-wul.

713
00:51:32,422 --> 00:51:34,174
Companion animal preferences.

714
00:51:34,257 --> 00:51:37,469
This is also a common problem,
but it's a critical one.

715
00:51:37,552 --> 00:51:41,515
I adopted him from a shelter
after he was abandoned by his owner.

716
00:51:41,598 --> 00:51:46,311
But Yeo-reum asked
that we send him away once we get married.

717
00:51:47,521 --> 00:51:51,024
I can't stand the thought
of raising a dog indoors.

718
00:51:51,107 --> 00:51:52,859
They shed, and their poop smells.

719
00:51:54,903 --> 00:51:57,531
I thought I should accept that much,

720
00:51:57,614 --> 00:52:00,158
so we decided to move into an apartment.

721
00:52:00,242 --> 00:52:01,785
Then what happened?

722
00:52:01,868 --> 00:52:05,705
My friend who was supposed to take him
said something came up and said no.

723
00:52:06,331 --> 00:52:09,042
So I asked if we could
keep him for a while.

724
00:52:09,960 --> 00:52:12,170
But she said no.

725
00:52:15,632 --> 00:52:20,470
Isn't there a different way
to work through this problem?

726
00:52:21,513 --> 00:52:24,558
You two matched
because you had similar tastes,

727
00:52:24,641 --> 00:52:27,394
so you decided to get married.

728
00:52:27,477 --> 00:52:31,189
Maybe you can compromise a bit
and come to an agreement--

729
00:52:31,273 --> 00:52:32,190
No.

730
00:52:34,276 --> 00:52:37,070
It's Yeo-reum's attitude and the way
she views and treats Gyeo-wul.

731
00:52:37,153 --> 00:52:39,281
There won't be
an agreement on that matter.

732
00:52:41,867 --> 00:52:43,201
Her attitude?

733
00:52:43,285 --> 00:52:45,078
Yeo-reum wanted to send Gyeo-wul

734
00:52:45,787 --> 00:52:48,331
back to the shelter.

735
00:52:48,915 --> 00:52:52,210
It means she's incapable of understanding

736
00:52:53,169 --> 00:52:55,422
the pain that Gyeo-wul went through.

737
00:52:59,217 --> 00:53:02,429
It means she can't relate at all

738
00:53:02,512 --> 00:53:05,932
to why I tear up when I see Gyeo-wul

739
00:53:06,600 --> 00:53:08,768
or why I laugh when he yawns.

740
00:53:14,399 --> 00:53:15,942
Maybe I'm being sensitive.

741
00:53:16,526 --> 00:53:19,571
But I want to reconsider this

742
00:53:21,156 --> 00:53:25,869
because I think I need to marry someone
on the same emotional wavelength.

743
00:53:26,828 --> 00:53:27,996
Same here.

744
00:53:29,581 --> 00:53:33,043
Instead of a person who simply shares
the same interests,

745
00:53:33,126 --> 00:53:36,338
shouldn't we be with someone
with the same emotional qualities

746
00:53:36,421 --> 00:53:39,049
for our marriage to last forever?

747
00:53:49,059 --> 00:53:50,977
When a man and a woman first meet,

748
00:53:51,061 --> 00:53:54,147
they begin to piece together
their tastes and hobbies like a puzzle.

749
00:53:54,230 --> 00:53:56,358
HONEYMOON

750
00:53:56,441 --> 00:53:58,860
But what makes a relationship last

751
00:53:58,944 --> 00:54:01,029
isn't taste but relatability.

752
00:54:02,906 --> 00:54:06,701
Good couples can sense
when they laugh over the same thing

753
00:54:06,785 --> 00:54:11,081
or when they feel sadness
or rage at the same moment.

754
00:54:12,999 --> 00:54:16,878
That means their attitudes
and values toward the world

755
00:54:16,962 --> 00:54:19,047
align with each other.

756
00:54:28,848 --> 00:54:30,517
Are you kidding me?

757
00:54:32,686 --> 00:54:34,980
Ms. Jeong, I thought
you were better than this.

758
00:54:35,063 --> 00:54:38,650
You're just full of compassion
when it comes to work, aren't you?

759
00:54:39,693 --> 00:54:40,902
I'm ashamed, sir.

760
00:54:41,945 --> 00:54:43,279
I'm sorry, sir.

761
00:54:43,863 --> 00:54:46,992
So how are you going to handle this?

762
00:54:47,075 --> 00:54:49,119
How does Ms. Jeong manage

763
00:54:49,202 --> 00:54:51,913
to ruin every case she's involved in?

764
00:54:53,373 --> 00:54:55,041
If something else goes wrong,

765
00:54:55,125 --> 00:54:59,462
I won't be able to keep
my promise with you.

766
00:55:00,296 --> 00:55:01,548
I'll handle this, sir.

767
00:55:01,631 --> 00:55:02,882
Of course, you will!

768
00:55:05,427 --> 00:55:07,887
Ms. Jeong, I can't help but think

769
00:55:07,971 --> 00:55:11,141
that you're so focused on the reward,
you're losing sight of your job.

770
00:55:11,224 --> 00:55:14,728
If this is how it's going to be,
I'll have to add another condition.

771
00:55:16,479 --> 00:55:18,606
If you can't take care of this problem,

772
00:55:18,690 --> 00:55:24,320
I can't guarantee you won't end up
working at a province office, Ms. Jeong!

773
00:55:24,904 --> 00:55:26,322
- But, sir--
- Forget it!

774
00:55:28,283 --> 00:55:29,743
Get out.

775
00:55:34,581 --> 00:55:35,832
Get out right now!

776
00:55:55,143 --> 00:55:56,269
I'm sorry.

777
00:55:58,772 --> 00:56:00,899
- Are you okay?
- Yes, I'm fine.

778
00:56:12,077 --> 00:56:13,036
MARRIAGE MORALE BOOST TEAM

779
00:56:13,119 --> 00:56:14,329
FIRST MATCHED COUPLE
TO GET MARRIED

780
00:56:22,754 --> 00:56:23,880
Thank you.

781
00:56:45,693 --> 00:56:47,070
Hey, Ha-na.

782
00:56:49,989 --> 00:56:53,076
I'll do whatever it takes
to take care of that couple.

783
00:57:04,587 --> 00:57:07,298
EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR
OH IN-A

784
00:57:07,382 --> 00:57:08,591
Yes, come in.

785
00:57:11,678 --> 00:57:13,388
What is it, Mr. Kim?

786
00:57:13,972 --> 00:57:16,766
I think you need to look at this.

787
00:57:28,153 --> 00:57:29,362
What is this?

788
00:57:45,462 --> 00:57:48,673
Ha-na, is something the matter?

789
00:57:52,218 --> 00:57:54,304
It's Ms. Lee and Mr. Kim.

790
00:57:54,387 --> 00:57:57,640
We worked really hard
to help prepare their wedding, right?

791
00:57:58,433 --> 00:58:00,018
Of course, we did.

792
00:58:00,101 --> 00:58:01,936
But they're breaking up.

793
00:58:03,897 --> 00:58:06,191
And I couldn't set up your next date.

794
00:58:06,274 --> 00:58:07,984
I even worked overtime for this.

795
00:58:08,067 --> 00:58:10,820
I thought all that was left
was the wedding.

796
00:58:10,904 --> 00:58:12,655
What's with the sudden breakup?

797
00:58:12,739 --> 00:58:16,284
They thought they had
similar enough tastes.

798
00:58:16,367 --> 00:58:19,370
But relatability is what's important
and that didn't match.

799
00:58:19,454 --> 00:58:21,206
What could I do about that?

800
00:58:21,831 --> 00:58:24,209
Even they said it wasn't my fault.

801
00:58:24,292 --> 00:58:26,211
So why does the mayor keep blaming me?

802
00:58:26,294 --> 00:58:27,545
You're right.

803
00:58:27,629 --> 00:58:29,422
This isn't your fault.

804
00:58:30,048 --> 00:58:33,176
He says it's all my fault and that
he'll send me to a province office.

805
00:58:33,259 --> 00:58:34,302
Unbelievable.

806
00:58:39,724 --> 00:58:42,393
I'm not leaving like this.

807
00:58:44,521 --> 00:58:46,397
Jeong Ha-na doesn't just sit back.

808
00:58:48,816 --> 00:58:50,276
Right, Cheol-hui?

809
00:58:51,694 --> 00:58:53,613
I…

810
00:58:56,783 --> 00:58:59,869
I'm going to make sure you get married.

811
00:59:03,831 --> 00:59:06,834
Don't worry. I'll eat
two bowls of rice and power through.

812
00:59:10,797 --> 00:59:13,049
I promise to take care of you, Cheol-hui.

813
00:59:26,646 --> 00:59:27,855
I've made a decision too.

814
00:59:29,274 --> 00:59:30,608
What?

815
00:59:31,192 --> 00:59:34,153
If you need good results
to avoid getting in trouble,

816
00:59:35,238 --> 00:59:39,951
let's get those results together, Ha-na.

817
00:59:46,874 --> 00:59:50,169
I like you, Ha-na.

818
01:00:02,098 --> 01:00:04,809
I mean, when I said I liked you…

819
01:00:04,892 --> 01:00:07,854
Liking the twins is a type of liking,
and I can like you too…

820
01:00:08,980 --> 01:00:11,608
When you looked me in the eye
and promised to--

821
01:00:14,402 --> 01:00:16,112
What?

822
01:00:53,650 --> 01:00:54,525
You.

823
01:00:54,609 --> 01:00:56,402
- What?
- What happened with Cheol-hui?

824
01:00:56,486 --> 01:00:59,947
If they kissed,
there's nothing else left to say.

825
01:01:00,031 --> 01:01:02,408
It's time we stepped up, right?

826
01:01:02,492 --> 01:01:04,369
We'll take care of this no matter what.

827
01:01:04,452 --> 01:01:05,620
Call her.

828
01:01:06,371 --> 01:01:07,622
- Ms. Jeong?
- Yes?

829
01:01:07,705 --> 01:01:08,956
Are you dating someone?

830
01:01:09,040 --> 01:01:11,793
You do want Mr. Bong to succeed, right?

831
01:01:11,876 --> 01:01:13,127
Yes.

832
01:01:13,211 --> 01:01:15,755
You wrote that marriage is responsibility.

833
01:01:15,838 --> 01:01:17,423
I did a long time ago.

834
01:01:17,507 --> 01:01:19,008
But it didn't end well.

835
01:01:19,092 --> 01:01:20,510
It didn't end well?

836
01:01:21,511 --> 01:01:24,555
Cheol-hui, do you have any life goals?

837
01:01:24,639 --> 01:01:26,516
Ha-na, you came into my life,

838
01:01:26,599 --> 01:01:28,810
so I want to plan it with you.

839
01:01:28,893 --> 01:01:31,854
Marriage is about being responsible
for each other forever.

840
01:01:31,938 --> 01:01:33,690
If you liked it, why are you worried?

841
01:01:33,773 --> 01:01:35,900
Marriage is a different matter.

842
01:01:35,983 --> 01:01:38,861
Ha-na, everything is fun
as long as it's with you.

843
01:01:39,404 --> 01:01:42,240
Ha-na, don't feel stressed.

844
01:01:42,323 --> 01:01:43,950
Don't worry about me.

845
01:01:44,742 --> 01:01:48,246
I have a meeting with Mr. Choi today.

846
01:01:48,329 --> 01:01:49,706
Is that okay?

847
01:01:49,789 --> 01:01:53,418
Can I really get married?

848
01:01:53,501 --> 01:01:58,506
