1
00:00:36,578 --> 00:00:37,871
ALL CHARACTERS, ORGANIZATIONS,
AND PLACES ARE FICTITIOUS

00:00:37,954 --> 00:00:39,247
FILMING OF CHILD ACTORS DONE
UNDER BROADCASTING GUIDELINES

3
00:00:54,471 --> 00:00:57,766
How much cash do you have?

4
00:00:58,391 --> 00:00:59,350
Pardon?

5
00:01:00,226 --> 00:01:03,229
Do you invest in stocks
or crypto, by chance?

6
00:01:05,398 --> 00:01:07,859
I tend to be straightforward.

7
00:01:07,942 --> 00:01:10,820
I believe it's important to be
completely open about finances

8
00:01:10,904 --> 00:01:12,655
when marriage is on the table.

9
00:01:14,365 --> 00:01:16,659
We met only 30 minutes ago.

10
00:01:16,743 --> 00:01:18,745
Isn't it too early to talk about marriage?

11
00:01:19,537 --> 00:01:21,998
I thought this was
just a casual blind date.

12
00:01:23,041 --> 00:01:27,754
This is the time to be open about
our objectives to increase efficiency.

13
00:01:27,837 --> 00:01:29,339
Let's be honest,

14
00:01:30,048 --> 00:01:32,133
when a woman is over 30…

15
00:01:34,469 --> 00:01:37,597
I still have a bit more to go
before I pass 30.

16
00:01:41,392 --> 00:01:44,771
I guess there's still one thing
positive about you.

17
00:01:45,563 --> 00:01:48,233
A civil servant isn't the best job,

18
00:01:48,316 --> 00:01:50,485
but your retirement age and pension are

19
00:01:51,402 --> 00:01:52,487
set in stone.

20
00:01:54,948 --> 00:01:57,826
- Yes, I do plan on working until--
- And maternity

21
00:01:57,909 --> 00:02:00,161
and parental leave shouldn't be an issue.

22
00:02:00,245 --> 00:02:01,329
Maternity?

23
00:02:01,412 --> 00:02:02,622
Since we're on the subject,

24
00:02:02,705 --> 00:02:04,874
you're not exactly young,
so we should have

25
00:02:04,958 --> 00:02:06,835
kids as soon as we're married.

26
00:02:06,918 --> 00:02:07,919
Pardon?

27
00:02:08,670 --> 00:02:10,547
I'm single by choice.

28
00:02:11,631 --> 00:02:14,050
- Single by choice?
- I think you misunderstood.

29
00:02:14,134 --> 00:02:17,303
I'm here for a casual date,
not looking for a spouse.

30
00:02:18,179 --> 00:02:22,767
If not for marriage, why would you go
on a blind date at this age?

31
00:02:25,854 --> 00:02:28,606
I believe you must meet
certain criteria to get married.

32
00:02:30,733 --> 00:02:33,987
Marriage between incompatible individuals
will only lead to issues.

33
00:02:34,571 --> 00:02:35,738
In that regard,

34
00:02:36,739 --> 00:02:39,242
I believe I don't meet those criteria yet.

35
00:02:42,620 --> 00:02:44,831
Then, you should've never agreed to this.

36
00:02:45,456 --> 00:02:48,918
Just because I don't want to marry,
doesn't mean I don't want to date men.

37
00:02:49,002 --> 00:02:50,962
Plus, I figured I might luck out and meet

38
00:02:51,045 --> 00:02:53,131
someone I just want to sleep with.

39
00:02:56,301 --> 00:02:57,510
Just to sleep with?

40
00:02:58,887 --> 00:03:00,430
But maybe not today.

41
00:03:01,306 --> 00:03:03,850
Also, I'm a civil servant.
To avoid ending up

42
00:03:03,933 --> 00:03:06,060
in a miserable marriage
with someone like you,

43
00:03:06,644 --> 00:03:10,440
I'll be sure to keep your advice today
deep in my heart.

44
00:03:13,192 --> 00:03:14,193
Wait.

45
00:03:35,298 --> 00:03:36,341
Thank you.

46
00:03:39,469 --> 00:03:42,513
Marriage? I'm not really interested in it.

47
00:03:42,597 --> 00:03:44,849
I can't be buried in a miserable grave

48
00:03:44,933 --> 00:03:48,978
filled with duties and responsibilities
I never wanted for the rest of my life.

49
00:03:49,062 --> 00:03:50,772
I'm sort of seeing someone,

50
00:03:50,855 --> 00:03:52,774
and I think that's just good enough.

51
00:03:52,857 --> 00:03:54,359
I enjoy living alone too much.

52
00:03:54,442 --> 00:03:56,736
My mom sometimes says

53
00:03:56,819 --> 00:03:58,488
that she has lost her sense of self.

54
00:03:58,571 --> 00:04:00,114
I'm not going to end up like that.

55
00:04:00,198 --> 00:04:03,117
I study during the day
and work at a convenience store at night.

56
00:04:03,201 --> 00:04:05,620
I wouldn't dare
to even dream about marriage.

57
00:04:05,703 --> 00:04:08,873
Why do I want to get married
when I already have a stable job?

58
00:04:08,957 --> 00:04:11,125
I personally wonder why I must

59
00:04:11,209 --> 00:04:13,544
more than why I am not.

60
00:04:13,628 --> 00:04:15,755
No one is required to get married.

61
00:04:17,340 --> 00:04:19,092
The camera loves me.

62
00:04:19,676 --> 00:04:22,804
I think a solo life is pretty great.

63
00:04:23,972 --> 00:04:26,975
REMINDER 20:00
SINGING LESSON

64
00:04:27,475 --> 00:04:29,811
I am Jeong Ha-na.
I'm 29 years old and single.

65
00:04:29,894 --> 00:04:31,562
Single by choice.

66
00:04:32,438 --> 00:04:35,483
As we walk down this path together

67
00:04:35,566 --> 00:04:38,486
I hope every moment

68
00:04:38,569 --> 00:04:40,154
You and I share together

69
00:04:40,238 --> 00:04:43,366
Sparkles brilliantly

70
00:04:47,328 --> 00:04:49,122
Good. Great job.

71
00:04:49,205 --> 00:04:52,417
It's just so amazing.
Every time it's a different song.

72
00:04:53,167 --> 00:04:54,627
I'm just not getting any better.

73
00:04:54,711 --> 00:04:55,795
Well,

74
00:04:55,878 --> 00:04:58,214
the thing with rhythm is…

75
00:05:03,553 --> 00:05:06,472
You should be one with the rhythm,
as if it was tattooed on.

76
00:05:07,056 --> 00:05:08,349
Now, relax those vocal cords.

77
00:05:08,433 --> 00:05:10,727
One, two, three, go.

78
00:05:10,810 --> 00:05:14,397
As we walk down this path together

79
00:05:14,480 --> 00:05:18,693
I get to check things off my bucket list
at my pace, as I see fit.

80
00:05:25,867 --> 00:05:27,952
I get to focus only on myself

81
00:05:28,036 --> 00:05:30,288
in my peaceful apartment.

82
00:05:44,510 --> 00:05:46,387
JEONG HA-NA'S LIFE GOALS

83
00:05:46,471 --> 00:05:49,515
I currently work as a civil servant,

84
00:05:49,599 --> 00:05:50,641
second-year, grade 7.

85
00:05:50,725 --> 00:05:53,394
My salary is meager, but it's fine.

86
00:05:53,478 --> 00:05:57,190
It's not like I'm going
to get married or have kids.

87
00:05:57,857 --> 00:06:01,110
If everything goes to plan,
I'll head to the Mediterranean Sea

88
00:06:01,194 --> 00:06:02,737
after I retire.

89
00:06:02,820 --> 00:06:04,155
TO LIVE BY THE MEDITERRANEAN SEA

90
00:06:08,367 --> 00:06:10,495
So I'm perfectly content

91
00:06:10,578 --> 00:06:13,915
with my life now
where I'm able to conclude

92
00:06:14,499 --> 00:06:16,918
my day with a can of beer.

93
00:06:18,753 --> 00:06:21,422
I'm so happy to be solo.

94
00:06:30,264 --> 00:06:32,517
INJEONG CITY IS HERE
TO SERVE ITS RESIDENTS

95
00:06:35,853 --> 00:06:38,940
If I want to maintain my single life,

96
00:06:39,941 --> 00:06:43,361
I need to hold on to
my rock-steady government job.

97
00:06:49,242 --> 00:06:51,786
Thanks for calling.
Jeong Ha-na at Parks and Greenery.

98
00:06:51,869 --> 00:06:54,455
Hey, get me the guy
I was just speaking to.

99
00:06:54,539 --> 00:06:55,540
Pardon?

100
00:06:55,623 --> 00:06:58,126
Get that prick on the phone right now!

101
00:07:00,419 --> 00:07:01,504
Sir…

102
00:07:12,098 --> 00:07:14,684
I'm sorry, sir,

103
00:07:14,767 --> 00:07:17,937
but if you could tell me
the name of the person…

104
00:07:19,981 --> 00:07:20,982
Hello?

105
00:07:22,024 --> 00:07:24,694
Where is the team manager?
Get them over here!

106
00:07:32,243 --> 00:07:34,537
Do you know

107
00:07:36,080 --> 00:07:37,331
how many times

108
00:07:38,499 --> 00:07:41,711
I've requested this trash to be cleared?

109
00:07:42,420 --> 00:07:44,505
Sir, if you could just calm down first--

110
00:07:44,589 --> 00:07:46,883
"Calm down. Calm down. Calm down!"

111
00:07:46,966 --> 00:07:49,552
That's all you ever say!

112
00:07:50,261 --> 00:07:53,139
If you could tell us
which walking path it is exactly,

113
00:07:53,222 --> 00:07:55,183
then we'll take care of it immediately.

114
00:07:55,266 --> 00:07:57,310
It's 50 San, Injeong City.

115
00:07:59,103 --> 00:08:02,815
Sir, because that is
located in a residential area,

116
00:08:02,899 --> 00:08:05,109
the Sanitation Department can assist you.

117
00:08:52,573 --> 00:08:53,741
My goodness!

118
00:08:54,742 --> 00:08:56,327
What's wrong with you?

119
00:08:56,410 --> 00:08:58,496
- What is all this?
- Damn it…

120
00:08:59,580 --> 00:09:00,873
What are you doing?

121
00:09:01,832 --> 00:09:03,167
Unfortunately,

122
00:09:03,751 --> 00:09:06,003
the job comes
with its share of shit storms.

123
00:09:07,129 --> 00:09:10,758
They say there are ten Heavenly Stems
when it comes to social hierarchy

124
00:09:10,841 --> 00:09:13,719
and that civil servants are
part of the lowest branch.

125
00:09:13,803 --> 00:09:15,137
You have to work like a dog.

126
00:09:18,683 --> 00:09:20,685
MAYOR IM GU-SIK

127
00:09:27,275 --> 00:09:29,944
CITY OF TONGJU
SUPPORTS YOUTH DATING

128
00:09:30,027 --> 00:09:34,156
How many likes is that? Seriously?

129
00:09:35,449 --> 00:09:37,702
Must I lose to Mayor Gong?

130
00:09:40,913 --> 00:09:42,748
Likes.

131
00:09:43,916 --> 00:09:47,044
So this is what people like nowadays?

132
00:09:48,588 --> 00:09:51,591
Then maybe we should assist
with marriages?

133
00:09:51,674 --> 00:09:52,633
Pardon?

134
00:09:52,717 --> 00:09:55,052
I hear it's so hard
to get married nowadays.

135
00:09:55,136 --> 00:09:58,723
A program geared for the youth
could resonate

136
00:09:58,806 --> 00:10:02,852
with the currently lacking 20s electorate
to increase your approval rating

137
00:10:02,935 --> 00:10:05,896
and help with your reelection.

138
00:10:07,148 --> 00:10:08,733
Reelection, you say?

139
00:10:10,109 --> 00:10:13,029
Then shall I give it a go?

140
00:10:17,033 --> 00:10:20,119
MARRIAGE MORALE BOOST

141
00:10:20,202 --> 00:10:23,122
We're going to need
to put together a fresh team.

142
00:10:23,956 --> 00:10:27,418
JOIN THE
MARRIAGE MORALE BOOST TEAM

143
00:10:28,919 --> 00:10:30,671
This can't be for everyone.

144
00:10:40,681 --> 00:10:42,767
- What's that smell?
- Geez.

145
00:10:48,356 --> 00:10:49,649
Tough day for you today.

146
00:10:50,316 --> 00:10:53,778
Now, they even want civil servants
to play matchmaker?

147
00:10:53,861 --> 00:10:54,987
What do you think?

148
00:10:55,571 --> 00:10:56,739
Maybe for a sham marriage.

149
00:10:56,822 --> 00:10:59,325
I don't think anyone can boost
morale for marriage.

150
00:10:59,408 --> 00:11:02,203
"The role will be positively reflected
in performance reviews."

151
00:11:02,286 --> 00:11:04,705
Maybe this is a chance
to get an in with the mayor?

152
00:11:05,915 --> 00:11:08,250
High risks and hurdles precede
high rewards.

153
00:11:11,462 --> 00:11:13,756
Maybe you should just toss the clothes.

154
00:11:15,466 --> 00:11:17,593
They're worth four times my hourly pay.

155
00:11:17,676 --> 00:11:18,803
I can't just toss them.

156
00:11:22,973 --> 00:11:24,392
It'll cost more to clean them.

157
00:11:43,077 --> 00:11:46,247
Is Ms. Jeong not back yet?

158
00:11:49,750 --> 00:11:52,920
I hope he took it over to Sanitation.

159
00:11:53,838 --> 00:11:55,881
I can't have him come after me again.

160
00:12:03,514 --> 00:12:05,474
Did someone bring a dog in here?

161
00:12:11,981 --> 00:12:14,525
DIRTY MONGREL
CHICKEN TEAM MANAGER

162
00:12:17,778 --> 00:12:20,531
The caller you are trying
to reach is unavailable.

163
00:12:20,614 --> 00:12:21,949
Please leave a message…

164
00:12:24,160 --> 00:12:25,202
Am I a dog?

165
00:12:27,496 --> 00:12:28,789
Am I a chicken?

166
00:12:30,082 --> 00:12:31,542
Sir, that's not it--

167
00:12:33,043 --> 00:12:35,504
I know bad-mouthing your boss helps
when it's tough.

168
00:12:35,588 --> 00:12:38,716
I won't be petty and hold
a grudge over something like this.

169
00:12:38,799 --> 00:12:41,051
You are quite witty.

170
00:12:41,135 --> 00:12:42,845
Such a great sense of humor.

171
00:12:42,928 --> 00:12:45,806
Feel free to take this chance
to share some more.

172
00:12:50,769 --> 00:12:52,855
A challenging complaint, bathroom break.

173
00:12:52,938 --> 00:12:56,358
Difficult project, pass off
to your subordinates. You say you're fine…

174
00:13:10,164 --> 00:13:11,332
Is there more?

175
00:13:11,415 --> 00:13:14,293
I can't think of any more right now.

176
00:13:15,044 --> 00:13:17,588
Okay. Let me know
if you think of some more.

177
00:13:18,214 --> 00:13:22,384
All right. It's almost time to go home.
Everyone, enjoy the rest of the day.

178
00:13:30,643 --> 00:13:32,561
You know once he holds a grudge,

179
00:13:32,645 --> 00:13:34,647
he makes your life a living hell.

180
00:13:35,231 --> 00:13:36,774
What are you going to do?

181
00:13:43,948 --> 00:13:45,241
Good luck.

182
00:13:45,324 --> 00:13:49,453
It'll be great. Put your years
at the matchmaking agency to good use.

183
00:13:49,537 --> 00:13:52,831
I made this special recommendation,
just for you.

184
00:13:56,335 --> 00:14:00,673
I was transferred to where I never wished
to go, the Marriage Morale team.

185
00:14:01,590 --> 00:14:03,384
In other words, I was screwed over.

186
00:14:10,474 --> 00:14:11,809
Hey, how's it going?

187
00:14:13,561 --> 00:14:15,104
What did you end up eating?

188
00:14:16,105 --> 00:14:17,940
Are you Ms. Jeong Ha-na?

189
00:14:24,864 --> 00:14:25,990
It's nice to meet you.

190
00:14:26,073 --> 00:14:29,243
LEE JI-GYEONG, PREGNANT
WITH SNIFFLES, HAPPILY MARRIED

191
00:14:30,077 --> 00:14:33,122
Oh, right. That desk over there is yours.

192
00:14:33,205 --> 00:14:35,249
Here. Let me help you.

193
00:14:35,332 --> 00:14:36,542
No, it's fine.

194
00:14:36,625 --> 00:14:39,378
Please let me. I can help you with that.

195
00:14:39,461 --> 00:14:41,630
And I'm Han Bin.

196
00:14:41,714 --> 00:14:42,756
Here's to great things.

197
00:14:43,340 --> 00:14:47,344
HAN BIN, PROBATIONARY PERIOD,
BLINDLY PASSIONATE

198
00:14:49,054 --> 00:14:50,055
What?

199
00:14:50,139 --> 00:14:53,976
Ms. Jeong from your team used to work
at a matchmaking agency?

200
00:14:54,059 --> 00:14:58,063
YANG SEUNG-GU, SECTION CHIEF,
CLOCKS OUT ON TIME

201
00:14:58,147 --> 00:14:59,565
Hold on a second.

202
00:14:59,648 --> 00:15:02,943
Yeah, we should grab a drink soon.
Okay, bye.

203
00:15:05,154 --> 00:15:06,989
Thanks to our matchmaking whiz here,

204
00:15:07,072 --> 00:15:10,159
we'll be able to take care of this
for the mayor in no time.

205
00:15:10,242 --> 00:15:13,078
You used to work at a matchmaking agency?

206
00:15:13,162 --> 00:15:15,748
- Then she's an expert!
- Correct.

207
00:15:15,831 --> 00:15:18,042
So did you volunteer for this position?

208
00:15:18,125 --> 00:15:19,627
I definitely did not.

209
00:15:25,299 --> 00:15:26,926
I definitely did not.

210
00:15:31,639 --> 00:15:33,974
- I see.
- Sure.

211
00:15:35,392 --> 00:15:38,896
We don't even have a team manager yet,
and we already have an assignment?

212
00:15:38,979 --> 00:15:40,940
I know, right?

213
00:15:41,523 --> 00:15:44,526
Marriage Morale Bust isn't going
to be a cakewalk, either.

214
00:15:44,610 --> 00:15:45,819
- Mr. Yang.
- Yes?

215
00:15:45,903 --> 00:15:47,905
It's "Marriage Morale Boost."

216
00:15:49,073 --> 00:15:50,407
Right. Boost.

217
00:15:52,117 --> 00:15:54,662
I already have a bad feeling about this.

218
00:16:02,920 --> 00:16:04,546
So basically,

219
00:16:04,630 --> 00:16:06,173
this team is screwed.

220
00:16:06,256 --> 00:16:07,883
Why? How so?

221
00:16:07,967 --> 00:16:10,469
One hopelessly awaiting retirement,

222
00:16:10,552 --> 00:16:12,262
one happily awaiting maternity leave,

223
00:16:12,346 --> 00:16:14,473
and one cluelessly awaiting full-time.

224
00:16:14,556 --> 00:16:15,557
And the team manager?

225
00:16:16,433 --> 00:16:17,685
Not assigned yet.

226
00:16:17,768 --> 00:16:20,020
But I'm worried about them, too.

227
00:16:20,104 --> 00:16:24,858
Then does this mean you won't be able
to clock out on the dot anymore?

228
00:16:27,403 --> 00:16:29,446
How incredibly ironic.

229
00:16:29,530 --> 00:16:32,408
Ms. Single by Choice
is promoting marriage.

230
00:16:36,203 --> 00:16:37,955
I know, right?

231
00:16:38,038 --> 00:16:40,499
I quit that matchmaking agency
for a reason.

232
00:17:10,571 --> 00:17:11,655
Are you kidding me?

233
00:17:11,739 --> 00:17:13,365
MATCHMAKING AGENCY
NO. 1 IN SALES

234
00:17:13,449 --> 00:17:15,534
Three years ago, I worked

235
00:17:15,617 --> 00:17:18,495
at a matchmaking agency
as a couples manager.

236
00:17:18,579 --> 00:17:21,790
I told you we just need to look
at the numbers and ranking.

237
00:17:21,874 --> 00:17:23,584
Who are you to call your own shots?

238
00:17:24,752 --> 00:17:28,172
Mr. Lee had some issues
during the last match and--

239
00:17:28,255 --> 00:17:30,090
Who doesn't?

240
00:17:31,508 --> 00:17:32,676
Wake up.

241
00:17:32,760 --> 00:17:35,387
Hiding those issues is a part of your job.

242
00:17:42,436 --> 00:17:44,480
This is all your fault.

243
00:17:44,563 --> 00:17:48,025
How could you set her up
with someone like that?

244
00:17:48,650 --> 00:17:50,736
Just look at her.

245
00:17:51,528 --> 00:17:52,780
My poor daughter…

246
00:17:52,863 --> 00:17:56,825
Succumbing to the pressures of achieving
the most matches

247
00:17:57,451 --> 00:17:59,828
led to calamity in the end.

248
00:18:07,127 --> 00:18:09,713
It led to the demise
of someone else's marriage…

249
00:18:10,255 --> 00:18:11,465
CHOI GI-JUN AND JEONG HA-NA

250
00:18:11,548 --> 00:18:14,134
…but I still had hopes for mine.

251
00:18:28,315 --> 00:18:29,858
Unfortunately, in the end,

252
00:18:31,443 --> 00:18:34,571
my marriage also met its demise that day.

253
00:18:39,159 --> 00:18:41,703
I became a civil servant to get away

254
00:18:41,787 --> 00:18:43,580
from everything related to marriage.

255
00:18:44,498 --> 00:18:47,459
And now, I must foster
someone else's marriage again.

256
00:18:51,588 --> 00:18:53,507
Mr. Bong of Cheongdo.

257
00:18:53,590 --> 00:18:56,009
Bong Cheol-hui is a 34-year-old bachelor.

258
00:18:56,885 --> 00:18:58,679
He is old enough to be married,

259
00:18:58,762 --> 00:19:02,432
but he's too busy
looking after his twin nephew and niece.

260
00:19:04,351 --> 00:19:05,727
What do you…

261
00:19:06,436 --> 00:19:10,149
He plays an essential role
for all the villagers on the island.

262
00:19:10,232 --> 00:19:11,859
What do you think?

263
00:19:13,861 --> 00:19:15,696
About what, sir?

264
00:19:15,779 --> 00:19:18,490
Would you marry someone like that?

265
00:19:18,574 --> 00:19:20,534
Who do you mean?

266
00:19:22,452 --> 00:19:24,204
It's summer now.

267
00:19:24,288 --> 00:19:28,542
HUMAN CINEMA
ISLAND BACHELOR BONG CHEOL-HUI

268
00:20:00,532 --> 00:20:05,245
Are you talking about that hopeless,
bottom-tier, Island Bachelor?

269
00:20:06,496 --> 00:20:07,497
Right?

270
00:20:08,582 --> 00:20:10,667
- It'll be hard, right?
- A bit.

271
00:20:12,294 --> 00:20:14,713
If we can get
someone like that married off,

272
00:20:15,297 --> 00:20:17,257
wouldn't it be simply awe-inspiring?

273
00:20:19,343 --> 00:20:22,721
Mr. Bong Cheol-hui of Cheongdo.

274
00:20:23,597 --> 00:20:26,308
Will he ever get the chance
to hear wedding bells?

275
00:20:27,309 --> 00:20:31,897
We wish him luck and hope
that his wedding wishes come true soon.

276
00:20:38,528 --> 00:20:40,948
As you can see,
65% of the survey participants

277
00:20:41,031 --> 00:20:44,326
in their 20s and 30s
don't see marriage as a necessity.

278
00:20:44,409 --> 00:20:47,246
Gosh, 65%? That's over half.

279
00:20:47,829 --> 00:20:49,122
As for their reasoning…

280
00:20:49,206 --> 00:20:50,749
Men cited a lack of wedding funds,

281
00:20:50,832 --> 00:20:52,292
job insecurity,

282
00:20:52,376 --> 00:20:54,044
and other financial issues.

283
00:20:54,127 --> 00:20:55,921
A lot of women cited the pressures

284
00:20:56,004 --> 00:20:58,340
of married life and child-rearing.

285
00:20:58,423 --> 00:21:00,550
To summarize,
money is the deterrent for men

286
00:21:00,634 --> 00:21:04,388
and the dread of married life is
the deterrent for women.

287
00:21:05,013 --> 00:21:06,556
Hence, living alone is the answer.

288
00:21:12,896 --> 00:21:14,147
Just my personal opinion.

289
00:21:15,232 --> 00:21:18,568
Geez, that's not really poor.
We were poor back then.

290
00:21:18,652 --> 00:21:20,696
No money, no car, no house. Nothing.

291
00:21:20,779 --> 00:21:23,031
But still, you need to get married.

292
00:21:23,115 --> 00:21:26,243
Have some kids and raise them well.
That's joy. That's happiness.

293
00:21:26,326 --> 00:21:28,370
You know… Right?

294
00:21:31,540 --> 00:21:32,666
Me?

295
00:21:35,544 --> 00:21:37,629
What? I can't believe this.

296
00:21:37,713 --> 00:21:39,589
I'm not of your generation.

297
00:21:40,924 --> 00:21:43,385
Sniffles will hear you. Don't be absurd.

298
00:21:43,468 --> 00:21:44,678
Sorry, Sniffles.

299
00:21:45,429 --> 00:21:47,681
But where are we going
to find our participants?

300
00:21:48,265 --> 00:21:50,434
I don't even know how we'll promote it.

301
00:21:51,351 --> 00:21:53,603
This man will be doing the promotion.

302
00:21:53,687 --> 00:21:54,855
Hello, sir!

303
00:21:55,689 --> 00:21:58,025
Yes, hello. Thank you for your hard work.

304
00:21:58,108 --> 00:21:59,943
You can set it down there.

305
00:22:03,572 --> 00:22:07,075
For the first participant in the project
you're all worried about…

306
00:22:07,826 --> 00:22:09,286
I'd like to propose him.

307
00:22:12,789 --> 00:22:15,250
- Don't use spit.
- Calm down.

308
00:22:15,334 --> 00:22:17,419
Wait. This is…

309
00:22:18,128 --> 00:22:20,422
Hold on. I've seen him on TV.

310
00:22:22,382 --> 00:22:26,344
He was really trending
in the mom communities for a while.

311
00:22:26,428 --> 00:22:30,223
I'm sure
his TV fame will help make a splash,

312
00:22:30,307 --> 00:22:32,893
but if we fail,
it'll be equally as damaging, won't it?

313
00:22:32,976 --> 00:22:34,227
Exactly.

314
00:22:34,311 --> 00:22:36,146
So you just need to succeed.

315
00:22:36,646 --> 00:22:38,774
Injeong is known for its benevolence.

316
00:22:38,857 --> 00:22:40,776
We need to help this chap out.

317
00:22:40,859 --> 00:22:43,153
From what I hear,
we even have a pro with us.

318
00:22:43,236 --> 00:22:47,365
Yes, sir. Ms. Jeong here used to work
at a matchmaking agency.

319
00:22:47,449 --> 00:22:49,076
Is that so?

320
00:22:51,745 --> 00:22:53,497
I wasn't there for that long.

321
00:22:53,580 --> 00:22:54,915
And I quit a long time ago.

322
00:22:57,125 --> 00:22:59,377
How would you feel about taking the lead?

323
00:22:59,461 --> 00:23:00,462
Pardon?

324
00:23:00,545 --> 00:23:04,257
If you can bring Mr. Bong here
and find him a spouse,

325
00:23:04,341 --> 00:23:06,551
I can guarantee you a handsome reward.

326
00:23:10,680 --> 00:23:11,807
Tell him you'll do it.

327
00:23:11,890 --> 00:23:13,850
- Say yes.
- You got this.

328
00:23:24,861 --> 00:23:25,987
Jeong Ha-na.

329
00:23:28,573 --> 00:23:29,658
Jeong Ha-na!

330
00:23:35,330 --> 00:23:37,499
You finally lost your mind.

331
00:23:38,416 --> 00:23:43,004
I'm just trying to figure out a way
to escape the Marriage Morale Boost Team.

332
00:23:43,505 --> 00:23:45,173
Does such a way even exist?

333
00:23:48,718 --> 00:23:50,679
Option one. I resign.

334
00:23:50,762 --> 00:23:54,182
Okay. Clean finish. Great.

335
00:23:55,725 --> 00:23:57,936
I killed myself to get that job.

336
00:23:58,687 --> 00:24:01,022
I need that pension
if I'm living until I'm 100.

337
00:24:03,441 --> 00:24:05,193
What do you want me to say?

338
00:24:05,277 --> 00:24:08,071
Option two. I make the department go away.

339
00:24:09,322 --> 00:24:12,409
Why would the mayor get rid of it
when he made it?

340
00:24:15,328 --> 00:24:16,538
Option three.

341
00:24:16,621 --> 00:24:19,541
I excel beyond expectations
and land a special promotion.

342
00:24:19,624 --> 00:24:20,876
Done. That's it.

343
00:24:20,959 --> 00:24:23,545
- I do exceptionally well…
- Yeah.

344
00:24:23,628 --> 00:24:24,921
- And get promoted?
- Yeah.

345
00:24:26,506 --> 00:24:30,844
If you can bring Mr. Bong here
and find him a spouse,

346
00:24:30,927 --> 00:24:32,971
I can guarantee you a handsome reward.

347
00:24:34,181 --> 00:24:36,224
"A handsome reward."

348
00:24:37,517 --> 00:24:38,643
You just wait and see.

349
00:24:41,104 --> 00:24:42,480
- I'm off.
- "Just wait"?

350
00:24:43,690 --> 00:24:44,566
Wait!

351
00:24:52,699 --> 00:24:54,951
What just happened?

352
00:24:59,831 --> 00:25:03,210
- Ms. Jeong?
- Sir, I need to speak to you.

353
00:25:03,710 --> 00:25:05,212
What is it?

354
00:25:07,839 --> 00:25:10,008
I'll take care of Mr. Bong.

355
00:25:10,675 --> 00:25:12,636
What? Really?

356
00:25:12,719 --> 00:25:15,680
You made a wise decision, Ms. Jeong.

357
00:25:17,349 --> 00:25:19,100
But please promise me something.

358
00:25:19,184 --> 00:25:20,644
Promise?

359
00:26:04,396 --> 00:26:05,355
BONG CHEOL-HUI

360
00:26:05,438 --> 00:26:08,358
BONG-GYVER, PRIDE OF CHEONGDO
KNOWN FOR ASSISTING THE ELDERS

361
00:26:08,441 --> 00:26:10,277
There's no shot of his face.

362
00:26:12,696 --> 00:26:14,114
ISLAND BACHELOR
BONG CHEOL-HUI, 34,

363
00:26:14,197 --> 00:26:15,323
IS THE TALK OF THE TOWN

364
00:26:15,407 --> 00:26:17,325
AFTER HIS APPEARANCE
ON HUMAN CINEMA

365
00:26:24,457 --> 00:26:26,334
Maybe he looks like a monster?

366
00:26:36,594 --> 00:26:37,804
Hurry up already.

367
00:26:45,020 --> 00:26:47,522
- Spray some water here.
- Stop that.

368
00:26:48,189 --> 00:26:50,817
My goodness. Pour it already.

369
00:27:24,976 --> 00:27:27,020
Cheol-hui is the best!

370
00:27:27,103 --> 00:27:30,065
Oh my! Just look at those broad shoulders.

371
00:27:30,148 --> 00:27:33,943
- Bong Cheol-hui is the best.
- The best.

372
00:27:56,758 --> 00:27:57,884
Darn it.

373
00:28:08,269 --> 00:28:10,563
San-i, Ba-da, breakfast.

374
00:28:30,834 --> 00:28:32,710
My life is in shambles.

375
00:28:33,753 --> 00:28:36,714
I'm back to being a couples manager.

376
00:28:38,508 --> 00:28:41,594
This is my one chance to escape all this.

377
00:28:41,678 --> 00:28:42,887
Promise?

378
00:28:42,971 --> 00:28:45,640
If I succeed, please transfer me
to another department.

379
00:28:45,724 --> 00:28:47,892
Just get Mr. Bong married.

380
00:28:47,976 --> 00:28:52,313
Then I'll gladly fulfill that promise
and transfer you to another department.

381
00:28:53,022 --> 00:28:54,983
Island Bachelor Bong Cheol-hui,

382
00:28:55,066 --> 00:28:57,193
I will marry you off no matter what.

383
00:29:12,625 --> 00:29:15,003
Hold on.
Are you going out to sea today too?

384
00:29:15,086 --> 00:29:17,213
Yeah, I have to.

385
00:29:17,297 --> 00:29:19,090
Always be careful.

386
00:29:19,174 --> 00:29:22,010
Of course. I'll be sure to.

387
00:29:22,093 --> 00:29:23,970
Are you busy right now?

388
00:29:25,764 --> 00:29:26,765
Why do you ask?

389
00:29:26,848 --> 00:29:29,934
I think my boat is messed up.

390
00:29:30,018 --> 00:29:33,062
I almost didn't make it back two days ago.

391
00:29:33,146 --> 00:29:34,689
You could've been in big trouble.

392
00:29:34,773 --> 00:29:38,610
It's fine. What's the worst thing
that could happen? I die?

393
00:29:40,570 --> 00:29:43,156
Well, do you want me to take a look?

394
00:29:43,239 --> 00:29:44,240
Will you?

395
00:30:13,812 --> 00:30:14,813
Hey.

396
00:30:16,523 --> 00:30:17,565
What's up?

397
00:30:24,781 --> 00:30:25,949
Thank you.

398
00:30:28,201 --> 00:30:29,869
Thank you for the ride.

399
00:30:35,959 --> 00:30:37,293
Where could he be?

400
00:30:48,012 --> 00:30:49,013
Stab them.

401
00:30:52,225 --> 00:30:54,185
Just slice them open. Show no mercy.

402
00:30:59,148 --> 00:31:00,483
Slice them?

403
00:31:01,150 --> 00:31:04,279
Slice them up
and be sure to bury them deep.

404
00:31:05,989 --> 00:31:06,990
Is he a gangster?

405
00:31:13,580 --> 00:31:14,581
What…

406
00:31:15,123 --> 00:31:16,124
I'll call you back.

407
00:31:32,140 --> 00:31:33,141
Please don't!

408
00:31:36,436 --> 00:31:38,813
Hey, are you hurt?

409
00:31:39,314 --> 00:31:40,398
Geez.

410
00:31:44,986 --> 00:31:47,155
Any louder,
and you'll scare yourself to death.

411
00:31:47,238 --> 00:31:48,239
Death?

412
00:31:48,865 --> 00:31:51,159
Slice them up
and be sure to bury them deep.

413
00:31:53,036 --> 00:31:54,621
No! I'm too young!

414
00:31:56,205 --> 00:31:57,206
What?

415
00:31:58,249 --> 00:31:59,834
What's wrong with you? What now?

416
00:32:02,337 --> 00:32:04,714
- What the…
- Don't come any closer!

417
00:32:04,797 --> 00:32:06,382
What's up? What's wrong?

418
00:32:07,216 --> 00:32:08,217
What?

419
00:32:10,219 --> 00:32:11,220
What's wrong with her?

420
00:32:15,558 --> 00:32:17,226
I've never seen her before.

421
00:32:36,788 --> 00:32:38,164
Did he stop chasing me?

422
00:32:38,706 --> 00:32:40,416
What's his deal?

423
00:32:43,378 --> 00:32:44,837
- You stink.
- You stink.

424
00:32:50,259 --> 00:32:51,803
Did something bad happen to you?

425
00:32:51,886 --> 00:32:53,262
No, I'm fine.

426
00:32:53,346 --> 00:32:54,973
Do you two live here?

427
00:32:56,474 --> 00:33:00,478
Then, by any chance, do you know
a man named Bong Cheol-hui?

428
00:33:02,438 --> 00:33:03,564
Why do you ask?

429
00:33:04,148 --> 00:33:05,942
I need to meet him.

430
00:33:06,025 --> 00:33:07,276
Right. But why?

431
00:33:08,236 --> 00:33:09,237
Marriage…

432
00:33:13,199 --> 00:33:14,993
It's just something important.

433
00:33:16,828 --> 00:33:18,454
- We don't know him.
- We don't know him.

434
00:33:18,997 --> 00:33:20,790
- Let's go.
- Okay.

435
00:33:20,873 --> 00:33:23,418
- Geez. She stinks.
- Gosh.

436
00:33:30,049 --> 00:33:31,718
- Have a seat and try it.
- Go on.

437
00:33:31,801 --> 00:33:33,553
- All right.
- My goodness.

438
00:33:34,721 --> 00:33:37,015
How is it?

439
00:33:37,890 --> 00:33:38,891
Unbelievable.

440
00:33:39,392 --> 00:33:40,309
What's this?

441
00:33:41,728 --> 00:33:43,312
Going after Paik Jong-won's job?

442
00:33:43,396 --> 00:33:45,481
My goodness. Don't embarrass me.

443
00:33:45,565 --> 00:33:49,068
I sliced open those clams you gave me
and mixed them right in.

444
00:33:49,152 --> 00:33:50,236
I see.

445
00:33:50,820 --> 00:33:52,447
Where did you bury the rest?

446
00:33:52,530 --> 00:33:55,616
We buried them
in the village chief's yard.

447
00:33:55,700 --> 00:33:57,827
My goodness. All that work.

448
00:33:57,910 --> 00:33:59,037
You deserve some praise.

449
00:33:59,120 --> 00:34:00,538
- Uncle!
- Uncle!

450
00:34:00,621 --> 00:34:01,748
Here they come.

451
00:34:01,831 --> 00:34:04,167
- Hello, ma'am.
- Hello, ma'am.

452
00:34:05,126 --> 00:34:07,295
- We should get going.
- Yeah, let's go.

453
00:34:07,378 --> 00:34:08,629
Thank you for all this.

454
00:34:08,713 --> 00:34:10,131
Take care.

455
00:34:10,214 --> 00:34:12,133
- Travel safely.
- Bye.

456
00:34:12,216 --> 00:34:13,885
- Come back soon.
- Okay.

457
00:34:30,151 --> 00:34:31,402
Excuse me, sir.

458
00:34:31,486 --> 00:34:33,362
Do you know Mr. Bong Cheol-hui,
by any chance?

459
00:34:33,446 --> 00:34:34,822
What? Who?

460
00:34:36,699 --> 00:34:37,867
Never mind.

461
00:34:42,246 --> 00:34:44,874
Am I ever going to find him?

462
00:34:47,919 --> 00:34:50,671
VILLAGE CHIEF PARK

463
00:34:56,844 --> 00:34:57,845
Hello?

464
00:34:58,429 --> 00:34:59,472
Hello?

465
00:35:00,014 --> 00:35:01,015
Hello, Chief Park.

466
00:35:01,099 --> 00:35:03,935
This is Jeong Ha-na
from Injeong City Hall.

467
00:35:04,018 --> 00:35:06,813
From the Marriage Morale "Bust" Team?

468
00:35:06,896 --> 00:35:08,689
I did receive the announcement.

469
00:35:09,899 --> 00:35:13,444
It's actually the Marriage
Morale Boost team, not "bust."

470
00:35:13,528 --> 00:35:16,197
Anyhow, I was hoping
to meet Mr. Bong today.

471
00:35:16,280 --> 00:35:17,949
Where should I go?

472
00:35:18,699 --> 00:35:22,912
What? Someone came looking for me?

473
00:35:22,995 --> 00:35:23,913
A lady.

474
00:35:23,996 --> 00:35:25,248
A lady?

475
00:35:25,331 --> 00:35:27,333
Talking about marriage.

476
00:35:27,416 --> 00:35:28,417
Marriage?

477
00:35:28,918 --> 00:35:31,879
Uncle, are you hiding something from us?

478
00:35:31,963 --> 00:35:34,132
What would I be hiding from you two?

479
00:35:35,007 --> 00:35:37,718
Have you already forgotten
that we promised to never keep

480
00:35:37,802 --> 00:35:38,886
any secrets between us?

481
00:35:39,387 --> 00:35:40,304
No.

482
00:35:40,388 --> 00:35:43,933
Then why would such a pretty lady
come looking for you?

483
00:35:44,016 --> 00:35:45,476
A pretty lady?

484
00:35:45,977 --> 00:35:46,894
Yeah.

485
00:35:49,313 --> 00:35:50,773
She sounds insane.

486
00:35:52,483 --> 00:35:54,527
- She did seem a bit off.
- Yeah.

487
00:35:55,069 --> 00:35:56,571
Well, that's that.

488
00:36:01,534 --> 00:36:02,785
Who's calling?

489
00:36:03,452 --> 00:36:04,662
Hello, Chief Park.

490
00:36:12,461 --> 00:36:13,713
Jeong Ha-na,

491
00:36:15,089 --> 00:36:17,675
marrying off
an island bachelor won't be easy.

492
00:36:18,885 --> 00:36:21,596
Maybe I should ask the mayor
for a different mission?

493
00:36:27,226 --> 00:36:28,227
Hello?

494
00:36:38,571 --> 00:36:40,031
Mr. Bong Cheol-hui?

495
00:36:43,618 --> 00:36:44,702
Who are you?

496
00:36:46,370 --> 00:36:50,208
Right. I'm Jeong Ha-na
from Injeong City Hall.

497
00:36:50,291 --> 00:36:51,959
City Hall?

498
00:36:52,043 --> 00:36:54,170
- Are you a civil servant?
- Yes.

499
00:36:56,130 --> 00:36:57,506
Can you prove it?

500
00:36:58,674 --> 00:37:01,385
I thought maybe you pooped
your pants earlier.

501
00:37:05,264 --> 00:37:07,558
Hey, are you hurt?

502
00:37:09,018 --> 00:37:10,102
Did you poop?

503
00:37:12,939 --> 00:37:15,733
I think I misunderstood
the situation earlier.

504
00:37:16,234 --> 00:37:18,361
But what is a civil servant doing here?

505
00:37:18,444 --> 00:37:19,528
Right…

506
00:37:22,114 --> 00:37:23,324
CIVIL SERVANT ID
JEONG HA-NA

507
00:37:24,992 --> 00:37:28,663
I'm from the Marriage Morale Boost Team,
and I'm here to help you…

508
00:37:29,330 --> 00:37:33,125
I have to take this Shrek of a man
with gangster vibes…

509
00:37:35,002 --> 00:37:36,712
and marry him off?

510
00:37:38,005 --> 00:37:39,507
Marriage Morale "Bust"?

511
00:37:40,549 --> 00:37:42,218
It sounds like you're trying to scam me

512
00:37:42,301 --> 00:37:44,720
because you think
I'm some island simpleton.

513
00:37:44,804 --> 00:37:46,639
Let me see that ID again.

514
00:37:46,722 --> 00:37:48,140
How do I know it's not fake?

515
00:37:50,017 --> 00:37:52,979
It's not "bust," it's "boost."

516
00:37:53,062 --> 00:37:55,773
And with that objective,
I'm here to help you.

517
00:37:55,856 --> 00:37:59,652
So you just show up out of the blue
and offer to help me get married?

518
00:37:59,735 --> 00:38:02,154
Our department did pop out of nowhere,

519
00:38:02,238 --> 00:38:04,282
but this will be
a great opportunity for you.

520
00:38:04,365 --> 00:38:05,616
Whatever.

521
00:38:05,700 --> 00:38:07,952
I have no darn interest in marriage.

522
00:38:09,120 --> 00:38:10,288
Leave.

523
00:38:10,371 --> 00:38:11,747
- But--
- I'm busy.

524
00:38:12,248 --> 00:38:14,458
But… Could you
just hear me out a bit more?

525
00:38:14,542 --> 00:38:16,752
Forget it. I'm busy.

526
00:38:19,088 --> 00:38:22,425
No! You can't!
You can't just leave like this.

527
00:38:24,093 --> 00:38:24,927
Excuse me.

528
00:38:25,011 --> 00:38:27,221
You can't just snatch away my phone!

529
00:38:27,305 --> 00:38:28,472
Seriously? Give it back!

530
00:38:32,935 --> 00:38:34,770
Just please hear me out. Please.

531
00:38:43,988 --> 00:38:45,156
Darn it!

532
00:38:47,533 --> 00:38:49,076
It's cracked!

533
00:38:50,244 --> 00:38:51,412
Just look at this!

534
00:38:51,495 --> 00:38:54,123
- I'm sorry.
- I can't believe this.

535
00:38:56,292 --> 00:38:59,295
May I have your attention, please?
Congratulations are in order.

536
00:38:59,378 --> 00:39:01,672
It looks like the pride

537
00:39:01,756 --> 00:39:03,549
and the mascot of our island,

538
00:39:03,632 --> 00:39:06,510
Bong Cheol-hui, is getting married.

539
00:39:06,594 --> 00:39:07,636
- What?
- What?

540
00:39:10,765 --> 00:39:12,183
Cheol-hui is getting married.

541
00:39:12,266 --> 00:39:13,851
- What?
- For real?

542
00:39:13,934 --> 00:39:15,728
What? Cheol-hui is getting married?

543
00:39:16,312 --> 00:39:17,563
What did you just say?

544
00:39:18,230 --> 00:39:21,984
Cheol-hui, did you give a warm welcome
to our guest from Injeong?

545
00:39:22,068 --> 00:39:24,070
My goodness. Congratulations!

546
00:39:24,779 --> 00:39:25,654
Gosh!

547
00:39:26,697 --> 00:39:28,741
You shouldn't have taken
my phone like that.

548
00:39:28,824 --> 00:39:29,992
Just look at this!

549
00:39:30,951 --> 00:39:31,952
I'm sorry.

550
00:39:33,579 --> 00:39:34,580
Anyway,

551
00:39:35,289 --> 00:39:39,251
are you really here to get me married?

552
00:39:40,086 --> 00:39:41,087
Hold on.

553
00:39:41,170 --> 00:39:42,880
What are they saying?

554
00:39:42,963 --> 00:39:45,383
- Calm down.
- Get down.

555
00:39:50,513 --> 00:39:54,141
"Injeong City Hall
Marriage Morale Boost Project"?

556
00:39:54,225 --> 00:39:55,434
An application form?

557
00:39:58,687 --> 00:39:59,688
Not interested.

558
00:40:00,481 --> 00:40:03,442
What… But you said
you wanted to get married.

559
00:40:03,984 --> 00:40:05,903
I've never said that.

560
00:40:07,113 --> 00:40:09,281
But in that documentary, you wanted to.

561
00:40:09,365 --> 00:40:11,367
You just felt like it was out of reach…

562
00:40:11,450 --> 00:40:15,121
I didn't say that.
The producer just spiced it up on his own.

563
00:40:16,205 --> 00:40:18,165
So you don't want to participate?

564
00:40:18,249 --> 00:40:20,876
Marriage, or whatever,
is a luxury I can't afford.

565
00:40:20,960 --> 00:40:21,919
I'm busy.

566
00:40:23,129 --> 00:40:24,839
I never saw this coming.

567
00:40:25,756 --> 00:40:27,842
We're done here. Leave.

568
00:40:29,969 --> 00:40:31,303
Wait, Mr. Bong.

569
00:40:31,387 --> 00:40:33,055
- My goodness!
- Goodness me!

570
00:40:33,639 --> 00:40:36,475
Goodness gracious! What are you doing?

571
00:40:39,186 --> 00:40:42,231
They say you gain a teammate
when you get married.

572
00:40:42,314 --> 00:40:46,277
Wouldn't gaining someone
who empathizes with you and supports you

573
00:40:46,360 --> 00:40:47,611
be a good thing?

574
00:40:54,952 --> 00:40:56,579
Do you really believe that?

575
00:40:57,413 --> 00:40:58,497
What?

576
00:40:58,581 --> 00:41:01,333
Do you truly believe that?

577
00:41:03,210 --> 00:41:04,211
I…

578
00:41:10,843 --> 00:41:11,719
REMINDER

00:41:11,802 --> 00:41:13,679

580
00:41:19,435 --> 00:41:20,936
Don't miss the last boat out.

581
00:41:22,730 --> 00:41:25,024
If I want to piece
my old life back together,

582
00:41:25,524 --> 00:41:26,609
I must

583
00:41:27,651 --> 00:41:29,236
marry this Shrek off.

584
00:41:31,697 --> 00:41:33,824
You'll miss it if you don't leave now.

585
00:41:37,995 --> 00:41:38,996
Bye.

586
00:41:41,457 --> 00:41:42,666
- Goodness me!
- Goodness me!

587
00:41:42,750 --> 00:41:44,585
I can't just go back like this.

588
00:41:45,127 --> 00:41:48,672
I must escape
the Marriage Morale Boost Team.

589
00:41:48,756 --> 00:41:49,882
Cheol-hui, do you

590
00:41:51,383 --> 00:41:52,468
have a spare room?

591
00:41:54,553 --> 00:41:55,554
A spare room?

592
00:41:56,222 --> 00:41:57,306
- A spare room?
- A spare room?

00:41:57,389 --> 00:41:59,225

MAYOR IM GU-SIK

596
00:42:21,580 --> 00:42:24,291
REQUEST:
MARRIAGE MORALE BOOST TEAM

597
00:42:24,375 --> 00:42:25,543
NAME: CHOI GI-JUN

598
00:42:26,919 --> 00:42:29,004
He went out of his way to request it?

599
00:42:31,048 --> 00:42:32,258
Why did he do that?

600
00:42:36,845 --> 00:42:39,014
This is it. Come on in.

601
00:43:04,039 --> 00:43:06,125
What are you doing? Hurry up.

602
00:43:07,251 --> 00:43:08,294
Okay.

603
00:43:36,697 --> 00:43:38,616
BA-DA, UNCLE CHEOL-HUI,
UNCLE'S BRIDE, SAN-I

604
00:43:38,699 --> 00:43:42,369
An island bachelor who must
look after his twin nephew and niece.

605
00:43:48,626 --> 00:43:50,336
It's that lady from before.

606
00:43:57,593 --> 00:43:59,720
I thought Uncle had no secrets.

607
00:43:59,803 --> 00:44:01,847
She said she was a civil servant, right?

608
00:44:01,930 --> 00:44:04,683
Yeah. Isn't that a good job to have?

609
00:44:04,767 --> 00:44:06,560
For now, I approve.

610
00:44:06,644 --> 00:44:09,772
But what happens to us if he gets married?

611
00:44:09,855 --> 00:44:12,316
We need to let him go at some point.

612
00:44:12,399 --> 00:44:14,443
Do you want him to die alone?

613
00:44:15,903 --> 00:44:18,322
You better get it together.

614
00:44:18,405 --> 00:44:22,534
He needs to find a good partner
for us to stay together longer.

615
00:44:24,453 --> 00:44:27,998
Although we still need to see
if she'd be a good partner for him.

616
00:44:36,924 --> 00:44:38,717
Did you make all this by yourself?

617
00:44:39,218 --> 00:44:41,261
I didn't know what you'd like,

618
00:44:41,345 --> 00:44:43,347
so I just made what I could
with what I had.

619
00:44:43,931 --> 00:44:44,932
Let's eat.

620
00:44:45,015 --> 00:44:46,809
Thank you for the food.

621
00:44:56,235 --> 00:44:57,611
How is it so good?

622
00:44:58,570 --> 00:44:59,613
It's nothing.

623
00:44:59,696 --> 00:45:01,407
Our uncle is good at everything.

624
00:45:03,617 --> 00:45:07,246
What do you like so much about our uncle?

625
00:45:10,290 --> 00:45:12,459
We know what's up.

626
00:45:13,210 --> 00:45:15,379
You fall in love and get married.

627
00:45:15,462 --> 00:45:16,964
What's up with you two?

628
00:45:18,674 --> 00:45:19,883
Look at her, all tense.

629
00:45:19,967 --> 00:45:24,221
I definitely heard the village chief say
that you were getting married.

630
00:45:24,304 --> 00:45:26,849
Isn't that why she's here for dinner?

631
00:45:26,932 --> 00:45:28,016
That's enough.

632
00:45:28,892 --> 00:45:32,229
It would've been nice
if you had told us when we met earlier.

633
00:45:39,736 --> 00:45:43,490
I'm here to help your uncle get married.

634
00:45:51,331 --> 00:45:53,292
I like you.

635
00:45:53,917 --> 00:45:57,171
Uncle, you don't need to worry about us.

636
00:46:00,382 --> 00:46:02,551
Don't you want to see
your uncle get married?

637
00:46:03,802 --> 00:46:06,597
You shouldn't ask such questions to kids.

638
00:46:06,680 --> 00:46:07,890
Uncle,

639
00:46:07,973 --> 00:46:11,059
we're all good living with your wife.

640
00:46:13,395 --> 00:46:15,939
- Shush. Just eat now.
- Okay.

641
00:46:45,594 --> 00:46:46,803
What are you up to?

642
00:46:47,804 --> 00:46:49,932
You know… The breeze and all…

643
00:46:52,017 --> 00:46:53,560
Dinner was delicious.

644
00:46:54,186 --> 00:46:56,146
I'm glad you enjoyed it.

645
00:47:06,782 --> 00:47:10,369
I was wondering… Are you married?

646
00:47:14,039 --> 00:47:15,040
It's a bit

647
00:47:15,541 --> 00:47:18,252
complicated,
but I'm actually single by choice.

648
00:47:20,212 --> 00:47:24,758
It's like I walked away from marriage
just to end up in front of it again.

649
00:47:26,552 --> 00:47:29,137
I used to be a couples' manager
at a matchmaking agency.

650
00:47:29,680 --> 00:47:31,515
Before I became a civil servant.

651
00:47:33,517 --> 00:47:35,394
There was this problematic client,

652
00:47:36,103 --> 00:47:38,021
but I looked the other way.

653
00:47:39,231 --> 00:47:41,275
It led to a disastrous end

654
00:47:41,358 --> 00:47:44,945
where the woman he was matched with
was hospitalized after he beat her.

655
00:47:47,489 --> 00:47:50,033
It really upset me,
so I went to see my boyfriend…

656
00:48:19,062 --> 00:48:20,480
So we're finally here.

657
00:48:42,127 --> 00:48:47,090
CHOI GI-JUN AND JEONG HA-NA

658
00:48:48,342 --> 00:48:49,968
I found him cheating on me.

659
00:48:51,345 --> 00:48:53,805
That was also the day
our wedding invites were ready.

660
00:48:55,098 --> 00:48:57,726
I began to wonder
if I was cursed by marriage.

661
00:48:57,809 --> 00:48:59,770
Did I do something wrong?

662
00:48:59,853 --> 00:49:02,064
After a whole lot of regret and torture,

663
00:49:02,648 --> 00:49:05,275
I ended up asking myself
the most important question.

664
00:49:05,359 --> 00:49:07,402
Why did I want to marry him?

665
00:49:10,280 --> 00:49:11,990
And did you figure out an answer?

666
00:49:15,494 --> 00:49:17,621
I realized I was unqualified
to get married.

667
00:49:19,665 --> 00:49:23,043
Like most people, I thought I needed
to get married with someone decent

668
00:49:23,126 --> 00:49:25,587
when I was old enough
because my parents said so.

669
00:49:25,671 --> 00:49:30,384
But I realized there were other things
I'd much rather do than get married.

670
00:49:32,344 --> 00:49:33,345
And now?

671
00:49:35,639 --> 00:49:37,140
I'm very much content.

672
00:49:37,849 --> 00:49:39,476
I like my everyday life.

673
00:49:41,561 --> 00:49:44,606
But do you remember
what you asked me earlier?

674
00:49:45,357 --> 00:49:48,026
They say you gain a teammate
when you get married.

675
00:49:48,110 --> 00:49:52,030
Wouldn't gaining someone
who empathizes with you and supports you

676
00:49:52,114 --> 00:49:53,407
be a good thing?

677
00:49:53,907 --> 00:49:55,659
Do you really believe that?

678
00:49:56,159 --> 00:49:57,202
What?

679
00:49:57,911 --> 00:50:01,415
Do you truly believe that?

680
00:50:05,335 --> 00:50:06,378
Honestly, I felt guilty.

681
00:50:08,046 --> 00:50:09,923
Because I don't believe that.

682
00:50:10,924 --> 00:50:13,176
And that's what made me more curious.

683
00:50:13,260 --> 00:50:15,137
I thought you might be different.

684
00:50:16,430 --> 00:50:17,931
Different…

685
00:50:19,558 --> 00:50:21,017
What makes you think that?

686
00:50:22,018 --> 00:50:25,105
You know, I believe one needs
to qualify for marriage.

687
00:50:26,356 --> 00:50:27,649
Qualify?

688
00:50:28,567 --> 00:50:32,654
I believe that only people who are able
to fully trust and support their partners,

689
00:50:32,738 --> 00:50:36,032
and be truly happy when they give
themselves wholly to their partners,

690
00:50:36,116 --> 00:50:38,160
should get married.

691
00:50:39,327 --> 00:50:40,495
I agree.

692
00:50:41,872 --> 00:50:47,085
Then are you saying you believe
that I have such qualifications?

693
00:50:49,921 --> 00:50:52,424
Seeing you support
the people around you makes me think

694
00:50:53,967 --> 00:50:55,385
you're a good man.

695
00:50:57,095 --> 00:50:58,096
And…

696
00:50:58,180 --> 00:50:59,931
There's more?

697
00:51:00,015 --> 00:51:02,976
That curly hair is a bit of an issue.

698
00:51:06,938 --> 00:51:08,899
But you seem dependable.

699
00:51:09,483 --> 00:51:10,484
Hold on.

700
00:51:11,443 --> 00:51:14,237
Why does every woman
act like this around me?

701
00:51:14,321 --> 00:51:16,990
- Have you fallen for my charms as well?
- What?

702
00:51:19,785 --> 00:51:23,538
You need to think twice
before you say such things.

703
00:51:23,622 --> 00:51:25,248
And we're suddenly romantic leads?

704
00:51:25,874 --> 00:51:27,542
Listen, I'm a man

705
00:51:27,626 --> 00:51:30,545
who sees it through to the bitter end
like a powerful bulldozer,

706
00:51:30,629 --> 00:51:32,589
once I set my sights on something.

707
00:51:33,173 --> 00:51:35,675
Do you understand what I'm saying?

708
00:51:37,219 --> 00:51:38,762
MARRIAGE MORALE BOOST

709
00:51:40,764 --> 00:51:41,765
Cheol-hui.

710
00:51:42,516 --> 00:51:44,476
Please help me out here.

711
00:51:45,143 --> 00:51:48,688
I must get you married. Please?

712
00:51:53,985 --> 00:51:54,986
Forget it.

713
00:51:55,487 --> 00:51:57,155
Read it over, at least.

714
00:52:53,503 --> 00:52:56,006
BONG CHEOL-HUI

715
00:52:56,089 --> 00:52:58,258
- Maybe some day drinking--
- I'd love that!

716
00:52:58,341 --> 00:52:59,426
- See you later.
- Bye.

717
00:53:04,014 --> 00:53:05,974
No word from Mr. Bong yet?

718
00:53:06,558 --> 00:53:08,268
You went to see him last weekend.

719
00:53:09,644 --> 00:53:13,189
His nephew, niece
and the villagers are his priority.

720
00:53:13,273 --> 00:53:15,400
He's not interested in marriage yet.

721
00:53:15,483 --> 00:53:16,526
- Really?
- Really?

722
00:53:19,237 --> 00:53:21,072
So you just came back?

723
00:53:21,156 --> 00:53:23,575
I did leave the application form with him,

724
00:53:24,326 --> 00:53:26,077
but I don't think he'll do it.

725
00:53:27,537 --> 00:53:29,664
How about waiting a few more days?

726
00:53:30,290 --> 00:53:32,626
Yeah, let's just give it a few more days.

727
00:53:32,709 --> 00:53:34,002
Maybe not?

728
00:53:34,085 --> 00:53:37,672
This was a special assignment
from Mayor Im, so maybe we finish it ASAP?

729
00:53:37,756 --> 00:53:39,841
Right. We need to finish it. ASAP.

730
00:53:39,925 --> 00:53:42,093
But pressuring him won't make him do it.

731
00:53:42,177 --> 00:53:43,720
Totally.

732
00:53:43,803 --> 00:53:45,597
Pressuring people never works.

733
00:53:52,270 --> 00:53:54,189
Why are you so easily swayed?

734
00:53:55,649 --> 00:53:57,025
Because I'm under your sway?

735
00:53:59,277 --> 00:54:00,779
I think…

736
00:54:00,862 --> 00:54:01,738
Yes?

737
00:54:02,322 --> 00:54:04,199
We should report this to the mayor.

738
00:54:04,282 --> 00:54:05,659
Right. We should.

739
00:54:07,911 --> 00:54:08,912
I should?

740
00:54:10,872 --> 00:54:13,750
No, no. When is our team manager coming?

741
00:54:17,253 --> 00:54:18,922
That's why he'll never be promoted.

742
00:54:57,502 --> 00:55:01,840
INJEONG CITY WILL HELP
YOUNG PEOPLE GET MARRIED

743
00:55:30,702 --> 00:55:32,746
This place is incredible.

744
00:55:40,712 --> 00:55:41,755
Ms. Jeong.

745
00:55:42,547 --> 00:55:44,632
You have a guest waiting
for you in the lobby.

746
00:55:45,383 --> 00:55:47,093
- A guest?
- Yes.

747
00:55:58,980 --> 00:56:00,690
MISSED CALL: BONG CHEOL-HUI

748
00:56:21,294 --> 00:56:22,295
Mr. Bong!

749
00:56:25,423 --> 00:56:26,591
- Cheol-hui.
- My goodness.

750
00:56:27,967 --> 00:56:29,135
Ha-na.

751
00:56:29,761 --> 00:56:31,971
You gave me a bit of a scare there.

752
00:56:32,055 --> 00:56:34,224
I was just so happy to see you.

753
00:56:35,517 --> 00:56:38,436
I saw some blanks and filled them in.

754
00:56:42,982 --> 00:56:44,317
So you decided.

755
00:56:44,901 --> 00:56:48,321
Yeah. You can stay single by choice.

756
00:56:48,905 --> 00:56:50,365
I choose to get married.

757
00:56:53,076 --> 00:56:54,911
You said I needed to be qualified, right?

758
00:56:56,329 --> 00:57:01,709
Then let's see if I'm qualified
to get married or not.

759
00:57:02,627 --> 00:57:04,671
Okay, I'll give it my best shot.

760
00:57:04,754 --> 00:57:05,755
Okay.

761
00:57:06,339 --> 00:57:08,383
That's it. Get back to work.

762
00:57:08,466 --> 00:57:11,052
Wait, Cheol-hui.
How about a cup of coffee…

763
00:57:13,221 --> 00:57:14,222
But…

764
00:57:18,518 --> 00:57:19,561
Ha-na.

765
00:57:43,793 --> 00:57:44,878
It's been a while.

766
00:57:49,716 --> 00:57:51,342
What brings you here?

767
00:57:53,303 --> 00:57:54,512
I was transferred.

768
00:57:55,722 --> 00:57:56,723
I see.

769
00:57:58,308 --> 00:58:00,435
But you don't seem very surprised.

770
00:58:00,518 --> 00:58:02,645
I tried calling earlier
because I was worried.

771
00:58:07,734 --> 00:58:10,445
- Ha-na--
- You can't call me that anymore.

772
00:58:10,528 --> 00:58:11,529
What?

773
00:58:11,613 --> 00:58:13,156
Anyway, this is perfect.

774
00:58:13,740 --> 00:58:15,867
Let's consider this our closure.

775
00:58:16,409 --> 00:58:17,827
Our closure?

776
00:58:26,169 --> 00:58:29,589
I should've done that three years ago.
Apologies for the tardiness.

777
00:58:31,633 --> 00:58:33,968
Ha-na, what's wrong? What happened?

778
00:58:35,178 --> 00:58:36,304
Well?

779
00:58:37,931 --> 00:58:40,767
Oh, right. Let me introduce you.

780
00:58:42,143 --> 00:58:44,562
- We're getting married.
- Yeah… What?

781
00:58:47,273 --> 00:58:48,399
We're getting

782
00:58:48,483 --> 00:58:49,859
married?

783
00:59:31,985 --> 00:59:33,486
When are we getting married?

784
00:59:33,570 --> 00:59:36,489
Are you moving in with
that pretty young lady from last time?

785
00:59:36,573 --> 00:59:39,242
Who knows? I'll know when I get there.

786
00:59:39,325 --> 00:59:42,245
They say you must share meals
to become a real family.

787
00:59:42,912 --> 00:59:43,913
Take your coat off.

788
00:59:43,997 --> 00:59:45,081
I heard Choi Gi-jun is

789
00:59:45,164 --> 00:59:47,208
- your new team manager.
- Am I too late?

790
00:59:47,959 --> 00:59:49,377
That was him, right?

791
00:59:49,460 --> 00:59:51,879
The bastard you told me about
back on the island.

792
00:59:51,963 --> 00:59:54,924
I'm Team Manager Choi Gi-jun
of the Marriage Morale Boost Team.

793
00:59:55,008 --> 00:59:55,883
Team manager?

794
00:59:55,967 --> 00:59:58,094
Is the Bong Cheol-hui project
coming along?

795
00:59:58,177 --> 00:59:59,470
I'll give it my best shot.

796
01:00:00,305 --> 01:00:01,347
That's amazing.

797
01:00:01,431 --> 01:00:05,018
Bong Cheol-hui needs to start strong.

798
01:00:05,101 --> 01:00:07,562
Don't be too nervous
about tomorrow's blind date.

799
01:00:07,645 --> 01:00:10,189
I'm not nervous in the least.
I know I'll do well.

800
01:00:10,273 --> 01:00:11,399
What do you think?

801
01:00:12,442 --> 01:00:13,443
I feel good.

802
01:00:14,777 --> 01:00:16,362
Why do you refuse to be set up?

803
01:00:16,446 --> 01:00:19,616
At the very least,
I'll choose who I marry.

804
01:00:19,699 --> 01:00:21,868
Incredible. It's even on the news.

805
01:00:22,452 --> 01:00:25,872
Maybe Mr. Bong doesn't need
to get married here?

806
01:00:25,955 --> 01:00:27,290
What about all this?

807
01:00:27,373 --> 01:00:28,333
Cheol-hui.

808
01:00:31,961 --> 01:00:36,966
