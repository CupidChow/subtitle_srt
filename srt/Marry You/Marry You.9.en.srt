1
00:00:36,619 --> 00:00:37,912
ALL CHARACTERS, ORGANIZATIONS,
AND PLACES ARE FICTITIOUS

2
00:00:37,996 --> 00:00:39,330
FILMING OF CHILD ACTORS DONE
UNDER BROADCASTING GUIDELINES

3
00:00:44,169 --> 00:00:46,796
I'm not leaving like this.

4
00:00:48,965 --> 00:00:50,759
Jeong Ha-na doesn't just sit back.

5
00:00:53,219 --> 00:00:54,679
Right, Cheol-hui?

6
00:00:56,264 --> 00:00:57,432
I…

7
00:01:01,186 --> 00:01:04,814
I'm going to make sure you get married.

8
00:01:08,276 --> 00:01:11,237
Don't worry. I'll eat
two bowls of rice and power through.

9
00:01:15,116 --> 00:01:17,535
I promise to take care of you, Cheol-hui.

10
00:01:31,090 --> 00:01:32,467
I've made a decision too.

11
00:01:33,760 --> 00:01:35,011
What?

12
00:01:35,637 --> 00:01:38,723
If you need good results
to avoid getting in trouble,

13
00:01:39,641 --> 00:01:44,312
let's get those results together, Ha-na.

14
00:01:51,319 --> 00:01:54,572
I like you, Ha-na.

15
00:02:06,543 --> 00:02:09,212
I mean, when I said I liked you…

16
00:02:09,295 --> 00:02:12,257
Liking the twins is a type of liking,
and I can like you too…

17
00:02:13,508 --> 00:02:16,177
When you looked me in the eye
and promised to--

18
00:02:18,888 --> 00:02:20,515
What?

19
00:02:39,033 --> 00:02:41,369
This is all your fault.

20
00:02:45,081 --> 00:02:46,249
I'm sorry.

21
00:03:13,818 --> 00:03:17,906
Before I knew it,
my emotions got the best of me.

22
00:03:25,455 --> 00:03:26,456
MR. BONG CHEOL-HUI

23
00:03:26,539 --> 00:03:27,540
Ha-na!

24
00:03:28,207 --> 00:03:29,626
Did you get home safely?

25
00:03:32,128 --> 00:03:36,466
I'm a bit worried,
so let me know when you get back.

26
00:03:41,721 --> 00:03:45,016
I like you, Ha-na.

27
00:03:54,692 --> 00:03:56,236
I think I liked it.

28
00:04:02,283 --> 00:04:05,161
What am I talking about? Get it together.

29
00:04:11,209 --> 00:04:13,711
TO MAINTAIN MY ROUTINE LIFE,

30
00:04:13,795 --> 00:04:17,632
I MUST ESCAPE
THE MARRIAGE MORALE BOOST TEAM

31
00:04:23,221 --> 00:04:25,098
I don't believe in marriage.

32
00:04:25,974 --> 00:04:28,643
Cheol-hui is
a marital matchmaking applicant.

33
00:04:38,861 --> 00:04:41,322
This relationship was never meant to be.

34
00:04:42,865 --> 00:04:44,951
You said I needed to be qualified, right?

35
00:04:46,369 --> 00:04:50,415
Then let's see if I'm qualified

36
00:04:50,498 --> 00:04:52,333
to get married or not.

37
00:04:52,417 --> 00:04:53,876
But just until the end of break.

38
00:04:53,960 --> 00:04:56,462
Of course, just during the school break.

39
00:04:57,046 --> 00:05:00,133
But if things don't work out
for me by then,

40
00:05:00,216 --> 00:05:02,302
you'll stay by my side forever, right?

41
00:05:03,886 --> 00:05:06,222
Can you really stay by his side, Ha-na?

42
00:05:09,100 --> 00:05:10,143
Ha-na.

43
00:05:24,073 --> 00:05:27,493
Marriage is about being responsible
for each other forever.

44
00:05:32,332 --> 00:05:35,501
But I can barely take care of myself.

45
00:05:35,585 --> 00:05:38,504
So how can I be responsible
for someone else?

46
00:06:01,277 --> 00:06:03,863
Ms. Jeong, you're here early today.

47
00:06:05,364 --> 00:06:06,741
Good morning.

48
00:06:07,658 --> 00:06:11,204
Hold on. Ms. Jeong, you look a bit…

49
00:06:12,288 --> 00:06:14,707
I didn't sleep well last night.

50
00:06:14,791 --> 00:06:16,042
Oh, dear.

51
00:06:16,834 --> 00:06:19,962
- Good morning.
- Good morning.

52
00:06:20,046 --> 00:06:22,256
Good morning, Mr. Choi. Hi, Ms. Na.

53
00:06:27,470 --> 00:06:30,556
Hello, this is Ms. Jeong
from the Marriage Morale Boost Team.

54
00:06:31,224 --> 00:06:32,391
It's me.

55
00:06:33,518 --> 00:06:34,602
Cheol-hui?

56
00:06:37,647 --> 00:06:39,941
Why are you calling me here?

57
00:06:40,024 --> 00:06:42,777
Because you never texted me back.

58
00:06:43,820 --> 00:06:45,988
It's not safe at night,

59
00:06:46,072 --> 00:06:48,074
so I was worried if you got home okay.

60
00:06:49,826 --> 00:06:52,870
And I wanted to ask you something.

61
00:06:55,414 --> 00:06:58,668
You want to ask me something? Now?

62
00:06:58,751 --> 00:07:00,503
What did yesterday's kiss mean?

63
00:07:00,586 --> 00:07:01,838
What?

64
00:07:06,551 --> 00:07:08,553
Are you trying to make me go deaf?

65
00:07:10,513 --> 00:07:13,558
I wish I could give you
plenty of time to respond,

66
00:07:14,142 --> 00:07:17,687
but I have a meeting with Mr. Choi today.

67
00:07:20,898 --> 00:07:22,233
It's today?

68
00:07:24,944 --> 00:07:26,571
Is that okay?

69
00:07:34,370 --> 00:07:36,998
Yes, of course. You agreed to.

70
00:07:38,958 --> 00:07:40,001
Really?

71
00:07:41,752 --> 00:07:44,255
Okay then. I'll see you later.

72
00:07:44,338 --> 00:07:45,673
- Okay.
- Bye.

73
00:07:57,727 --> 00:08:00,062
They've already kissed?

74
00:08:01,481 --> 00:08:03,608
What's wrong with your face?

75
00:08:03,691 --> 00:08:04,692
What do you mean?

76
00:08:05,234 --> 00:08:07,945
I'm asking why your cheeks
look like strawberries.

77
00:08:08,029 --> 00:08:09,655
You're such a little kid.

78
00:08:09,739 --> 00:08:13,034
From here on out,
minors aren't allowed here.

79
00:08:15,912 --> 00:08:17,788
What do you mean?

80
00:08:17,872 --> 00:08:19,207
Forget it.

81
00:08:20,041 --> 00:08:21,375
Just tell me.

82
00:08:26,422 --> 00:08:27,423
Yeong-eun.

83
00:08:27,507 --> 00:08:29,509
What brings you here at this hour?

84
00:08:35,890 --> 00:08:38,559
Did Cheol-hui go somewhere?

85
00:08:38,643 --> 00:08:41,062
He went to the city hall.

86
00:08:41,145 --> 00:08:42,688
You're not here to see me?

87
00:08:43,397 --> 00:08:44,398
No.

88
00:08:45,274 --> 00:08:48,236
Something's wrong, right? What is it?

89
00:08:49,946 --> 00:08:51,113
Well…

90
00:08:58,204 --> 00:09:00,748
Something happened
between you and Cheol-hui, right?

91
00:09:00,831 --> 00:09:02,333
What? How did you know?

92
00:09:03,167 --> 00:09:05,127
Did he tell you already?

93
00:09:05,211 --> 00:09:07,547
Look at you. What's with that reaction?

94
00:09:11,592 --> 00:09:15,388
Don't tell me you and Cheol-hui…

95
00:09:19,058 --> 00:09:23,062
- Did you two kiss?
- What? Of course not!

96
00:09:24,647 --> 00:09:27,692
Looks like I'm right.
So why did you kiss him?

97
00:09:33,281 --> 00:09:35,533
It just happened.

98
00:09:36,117 --> 00:09:38,202
So, have you two decided to date?

99
00:09:38,828 --> 00:09:40,371
No, we haven't.

100
00:09:40,454 --> 00:09:44,041
You don't plan on dating,
but you went ahead and kissed him?

101
00:09:46,961 --> 00:09:48,629
I wanted to check something.

102
00:09:48,713 --> 00:09:52,550
Right. Checking to see
if you want to kiss the guy,

103
00:09:52,633 --> 00:09:55,636
or if you can or not, is very important.

104
00:09:56,887 --> 00:09:59,724
So, what's the verdict?

105
00:10:04,895 --> 00:10:06,480
It was incredible.

106
00:10:06,564 --> 00:10:08,774
What am I going to do?

107
00:10:08,858 --> 00:10:11,152
If you liked it, why are you worried?

108
00:10:14,071 --> 00:10:16,157
Marriage is a different matter.

109
00:10:17,158 --> 00:10:19,744
And Cheol-hui is
a marital matchmaking applicant.

110
00:10:28,502 --> 00:10:30,630
This is your previous case profile.

111
00:10:30,713 --> 00:10:32,882
Are you still into the same type of women?

112
00:10:32,965 --> 00:10:34,050
About that…

113
00:10:35,301 --> 00:10:37,219
I've thought about it,

114
00:10:37,303 --> 00:10:41,849
and I'd like to add
a bit more detail to it.

115
00:10:41,932 --> 00:10:44,226
What do you want to add?

116
00:10:44,310 --> 00:10:46,729
Regarding the person I want to marry,

117
00:10:47,521 --> 00:10:50,566
I want us to share
the same sense of humor.

118
00:10:52,568 --> 00:10:53,569
Stop teasing me!

119
00:10:53,653 --> 00:10:56,614
That is what you said. Am I wrong?

120
00:10:58,366 --> 00:10:59,700
You should go inside now.

121
00:11:01,452 --> 00:11:02,995
"Sense of humor."

122
00:11:04,330 --> 00:11:08,584
And she needs to look adorable
when her shoelaces are untied.

123
00:11:10,503 --> 00:11:13,381
When you notice little things like that,
it's game over.

124
00:11:19,220 --> 00:11:20,888
Shoelaces. Right.

125
00:11:20,971 --> 00:11:24,558
And I'd like to add my strong suit.

126
00:11:24,642 --> 00:11:25,935
Which is what?

127
00:11:26,018 --> 00:11:30,940
Bong Cheol-hui is
an extremely responsible person.

128
00:11:31,023 --> 00:11:32,149
I'd like to add that.

129
00:11:33,275 --> 00:11:34,402
I'm not like

130
00:11:34,485 --> 00:11:37,238
a certain person who runs off
when there's a problem.

131
00:11:38,322 --> 00:11:40,783
As long as she likes me,

132
00:11:40,866 --> 00:11:42,576
even if the world ends,

133
00:11:42,660 --> 00:11:46,247
I'll make sure that she's happy.
That's what I'm saying.

134
00:11:46,330 --> 00:11:47,790
"Even if the world ends"?

135
00:11:49,708 --> 00:11:51,919
Why add this "strong suit"
all of a sudden?

136
00:11:54,547 --> 00:11:57,049
I want her to know
there's no pressure on her.

137
00:12:02,805 --> 00:12:04,140
What's with that look?

138
00:12:05,057 --> 00:12:06,350
What's with yours?

139
00:12:07,518 --> 00:12:08,811
Mine?

140
00:12:23,492 --> 00:12:24,994
Hi there.

141
00:12:36,797 --> 00:12:39,592
Ms. Jeong, did you go day drinking?

142
00:12:40,342 --> 00:12:41,886
No.

143
00:12:41,969 --> 00:12:44,472
Your face is about to explode.

144
00:12:44,555 --> 00:12:45,890
It's super red.

145
00:12:50,853 --> 00:12:54,064
Mr. Choi is definitely different
from other team leaders.

146
00:12:54,148 --> 00:12:55,357
Really?

147
00:12:55,441 --> 00:12:59,445
Of course. What team leader
personally interviews an applicant?

148
00:12:59,528 --> 00:13:01,405
I suppose you're right.

149
00:13:01,489 --> 00:13:05,034
Now that Mr. Choi is involved,
Mr. Bong will soon…

150
00:13:07,536 --> 00:13:08,996
get married, right?

151
00:13:09,079 --> 00:13:10,956
Ms. Jeong, it must be a relief for you.

152
00:13:15,419 --> 00:13:18,631
If Cheol-hui matches with someone else…

153
00:13:31,435 --> 00:13:32,686
Cheol-hui!

154
00:13:51,580 --> 00:13:52,831
Good work.

155
00:13:55,709 --> 00:13:58,587
The CEO asked about
your personal schedule.

156
00:14:00,214 --> 00:14:02,049
Isn't the reason obvious?

157
00:14:04,176 --> 00:14:08,013
He's even more frustrated after hearing
how it ended between you and Mr. Bong.

158
00:14:10,849 --> 00:14:13,269
MARRIAGE MORALE BOOST TEAM
SOMEONE SENT YOU A HEART

159
00:14:24,905 --> 00:14:27,199
JOO DONG-SEOK, 29 YEARS OLD

160
00:14:31,579 --> 00:14:33,455
Thank you, Mr. Choi.

161
00:14:41,130 --> 00:14:42,256
Can you talk right now?

162
00:14:42,339 --> 00:14:46,093
Yes, I can. Please go ahead.

163
00:14:46,176 --> 00:14:47,970
I have something to ask you.

164
00:14:48,637 --> 00:14:51,140
Somebody named
Joo Dong-seok sent me a heart.

165
00:14:51,223 --> 00:14:53,142
- I'll get going.
- Goodbye.

166
00:14:53,225 --> 00:14:56,228
- What should I do?
- Are you saying you got a match?

167
00:14:56,312 --> 00:14:58,856
Yes, just now. I got a notification.

168
00:14:58,939 --> 00:15:01,442
Take a look into this
and get back to me. Thanks.

169
00:15:01,525 --> 00:15:02,610
You're welcome.

170
00:15:16,624 --> 00:15:18,042
NAME: JOO DONG-SEOK
BIRTH DATE: MAY 15, 1994

171
00:15:20,252 --> 00:15:22,630
CLIENT: JOO DONG-SEOK
MANAGER: YANG SEUNG-GU

172
00:15:23,380 --> 00:15:25,507
- Mr. Yang?
- Yes, Ms. Jeong?

173
00:15:25,591 --> 00:15:27,468
Do you remember Mr. Joo Dong-seok?

174
00:15:28,802 --> 00:15:30,721
Joo… Who?

175
00:15:30,804 --> 00:15:32,139
Mr. Joo Dong-seok.

176
00:15:32,890 --> 00:15:35,309
It says here you're his manager,

177
00:15:35,392 --> 00:15:37,436
but there's no record of consultation.

178
00:15:39,313 --> 00:15:41,315
Of course. I remember him.

179
00:15:41,398 --> 00:15:42,608
How was he?

180
00:15:42,691 --> 00:15:45,277
He's a really great guy.

181
00:15:47,613 --> 00:15:50,366
Are you sure you updated
his consultation records?

182
00:15:50,449 --> 00:15:51,617
When was it?

183
00:15:51,700 --> 00:15:55,746
Hold on a second. When was it again?

184
00:15:56,789 --> 00:15:58,415
Let's see here.

185
00:15:59,959 --> 00:16:02,419
Mr. Joo Dong-seok…

186
00:16:06,799 --> 00:16:08,968
It's time we stepped up, right?

187
00:16:09,843 --> 00:16:10,844
Yes.

188
00:16:11,512 --> 00:16:14,848
If they kissed, he has to follow through.

189
00:16:14,932 --> 00:16:16,266
If we don't step up,

190
00:16:16,350 --> 00:16:19,395
our uncle won't get married
even when he gets really old.

191
00:16:19,478 --> 00:16:24,316
Right. A real man takes responsibility.

192
00:16:25,484 --> 00:16:26,694
Call her.

193
00:16:35,119 --> 00:16:37,454
CHEONGDO GRANDMA

194
00:16:37,538 --> 00:16:40,332
Hello, grandma!

195
00:16:40,416 --> 00:16:42,710
Goodness! Is that you, San-i?

196
00:16:42,793 --> 00:16:44,461
It's been so long!

197
00:16:44,545 --> 00:16:45,838
Yes.

198
00:16:50,926 --> 00:16:52,261
We're going to head out now.

199
00:16:52,344 --> 00:16:53,512
Take care.

200
00:16:54,930 --> 00:16:57,016
ACTIVE USER COUNT: 104
MEN: 62 - WOMEN: 42

201
00:17:04,064 --> 00:17:05,899
- Ms. Jeong?
- Yes?

202
00:17:05,983 --> 00:17:08,861
I'm joining you in Mr. Joo's consultation.

203
00:17:09,445 --> 00:17:12,322
Didn't you say you've already
spoken to him before?

204
00:17:12,406 --> 00:17:16,326
That's true, but I'm still his manager.

205
00:17:17,161 --> 00:17:20,039
Okay. I was just worried you'd be busy.

206
00:17:20,122 --> 00:17:22,332
No, I'm not busy at all.

207
00:17:23,500 --> 00:17:25,711
All right then. See you tomorrow.

208
00:17:25,794 --> 00:17:27,546
Take care, sir.

209
00:17:36,138 --> 00:17:37,056
MATCHING STATUS

210
00:17:37,139 --> 00:17:39,892
CURRENT STATUS: WAITING ON MATCH

211
00:17:49,651 --> 00:17:51,153
You haven't left yet?

212
00:17:51,236 --> 00:17:54,281
I still have work to do.

213
00:17:56,158 --> 00:18:00,204
You want Mr. Bong's case
to work out, right?

214
00:18:00,287 --> 00:18:01,413
Excuse me?

215
00:18:01,497 --> 00:18:04,249
I trust you'll keep your work
and personal life separate

216
00:18:04,333 --> 00:18:05,417
as you dislike trouble.

217
00:18:09,088 --> 00:18:10,881
- Right.
- And I asked the mayor

218
00:18:10,964 --> 00:18:14,968
to let you make up for the outcome
of Mr. Bong's case with a different one.

219
00:18:15,052 --> 00:18:18,722
He also knows it's not your fault
the couple called off their wedding,

220
00:18:18,806 --> 00:18:20,015
so don't worry about that.

221
00:18:22,017 --> 00:18:23,769
Right. Thank you.

222
00:18:27,606 --> 00:18:29,858
Is there anything else you want to say?

223
00:18:31,944 --> 00:18:33,237
No.

224
00:18:43,747 --> 00:18:45,582
There has been a surge in crimes

225
00:18:45,666 --> 00:18:48,710
targeting only women on their way home
in deserted alleyways.

226
00:18:48,794 --> 00:18:50,587
Misogynistic online communities

227
00:18:50,671 --> 00:18:53,549
continue to post messages
supporting these crimes.

228
00:18:53,632 --> 00:18:55,926
There are now concerns
about copycat crimes.

229
00:18:56,009 --> 00:18:57,344
Now to reporter Kim Dong-wook.

230
00:19:07,062 --> 00:19:08,188
Hey, In-a.

231
00:19:09,648 --> 00:19:10,858
Did you just get off work?

232
00:19:11,692 --> 00:19:13,360
I think you work late too much.

233
00:19:13,443 --> 00:19:16,446
You look pretty terrible.

234
00:19:18,115 --> 00:19:19,950
You look fine though.

235
00:19:21,493 --> 00:19:23,537
I came to my senses.

236
00:19:24,705 --> 00:19:27,082
Letting someone go
after giving it your all is

237
00:19:27,166 --> 00:19:29,001
the best thing to do.

238
00:19:29,710 --> 00:19:32,296
For both that person and myself.

239
00:19:35,424 --> 00:19:36,675
That's so typical of you.

240
00:19:37,676 --> 00:19:40,345
Mark my words, okay?

241
00:19:41,221 --> 00:19:42,598
Okay.

242
00:19:42,681 --> 00:19:46,518
Hey, guess what? I received a heart.

243
00:19:46,602 --> 00:19:48,103
I heard from Ha-na.

244
00:19:48,187 --> 00:19:50,314
She's meeting with the guy
who sent it to you.

245
00:19:50,898 --> 00:19:53,275
Wow, go Ha-na.

246
00:19:55,152 --> 00:19:57,571
So, do you have a good feeling about it?

247
00:20:01,158 --> 00:20:03,577
I'm still thinking,

248
00:20:03,660 --> 00:20:05,370
but his profile seemed decent.

249
00:20:08,040 --> 00:20:09,374
Just meet with him.

250
00:20:09,458 --> 00:20:12,377
It's better than
getting set up by your father.

251
00:20:12,920 --> 00:20:14,379
Please pull it off

252
00:20:14,463 --> 00:20:16,548
and give our team
a positive outcome, okay?

253
00:20:19,593 --> 00:20:22,638
Hey, Gi-jun.
For someone supporting a friend,

254
00:20:22,721 --> 00:20:24,598
it sounds like
you have an ulterior motive.

255
00:20:27,059 --> 00:20:28,810
- Was it obvious?
- Yes.

256
00:20:30,646 --> 00:20:31,980
In any case, this is good.

257
00:20:32,064 --> 00:20:34,483
Promise me you'll go
on that blind date, okay?

258
00:20:35,192 --> 00:20:36,944
Hey.

259
00:20:37,027 --> 00:20:39,279
You punk. Whatever.

260
00:20:39,363 --> 00:20:40,948
- I'm serious.
- Go work out already.

261
00:20:41,031 --> 00:20:42,366
Promise me!

262
00:20:46,411 --> 00:20:49,498
PROFILE INFORMATION

263
00:20:49,581 --> 00:20:52,376
"Someone who looks cute
with untied shoelaces"?

264
00:20:54,461 --> 00:20:56,004
He wanted me to see this.

265
00:20:58,048 --> 00:21:00,926
"As long as we share the same feelings,

266
00:21:01,009 --> 00:21:03,679
- I'll be responsible for their happiness…
- I'll be responsible for their happiness…

267
00:21:03,762 --> 00:21:05,889
- …until the world ends."
- …until the world ends.

268
00:21:08,558 --> 00:21:11,603
- You'll stay by my side forever, right?
- I told you to trust me.

269
00:21:11,687 --> 00:21:14,064
You ruined Cheol-hui's life too.

270
00:21:16,316 --> 00:21:19,319
Don't worry. I'll be responsible for him.

271
00:21:20,654 --> 00:21:22,948
I promise to take care of you, Cheol-hui.

272
00:21:24,032 --> 00:21:26,118
I'm the one who promised
to be responsible.

273
00:21:27,119 --> 00:21:29,413
Is this his way of saying
not to feel pressure?

274
00:21:37,379 --> 00:21:40,507
MR. BONG CHEOL-HUI

275
00:21:47,764 --> 00:21:48,974
Ha-na,

276
00:21:49,057 --> 00:21:51,810
did you get home safely?

277
00:21:51,893 --> 00:21:54,438
I'm getting off work right now.

278
00:21:54,521 --> 00:21:56,940
I just wanted you to know.

279
00:21:57,024 --> 00:21:59,026
No pressure.

280
00:22:24,593 --> 00:22:28,180
A relationship doesn't always
have to end in marriage.

281
00:22:29,765 --> 00:22:34,227
I think I ran away from relationships
to avoid feeling that kind of pressure.

282
00:22:36,063 --> 00:22:41,068
But this time, I just want to
go with the flow and see what happens…

283
00:22:44,738 --> 00:22:47,365
because being able
to get excited like this again is

284
00:22:47,449 --> 00:22:49,367
something to be grateful for.

285
00:23:04,966 --> 00:23:06,093
Ha-na!

286
00:23:11,848 --> 00:23:14,476
What's going on? Were you waiting for me?

287
00:23:15,519 --> 00:23:16,520
Yes.

288
00:23:16,603 --> 00:23:19,022
I said be careful at night.
You shouldn't be here.

289
00:23:25,028 --> 00:23:27,364
But still, seeing you here like this

290
00:23:27,447 --> 00:23:31,118
is really nice.

291
00:23:34,955 --> 00:23:39,501
I was worried
you'd feel awkward around me,

292
00:23:39,584 --> 00:23:42,754
and you wouldn't want to see me.

293
00:23:46,091 --> 00:23:47,342
Cheol-hui.

294
00:23:47,425 --> 00:23:48,510
Yes?

295
00:23:50,762 --> 00:23:52,305
I…

296
00:23:52,389 --> 00:23:53,723
Yes?

297
00:23:56,852 --> 00:23:58,270
I liked kissing you, Cheol-hui.

298
00:24:11,783 --> 00:24:13,827
I know I shouldn't feel like this,

299
00:24:15,036 --> 00:24:17,247
but I want to be honest with myself.

300
00:24:28,550 --> 00:24:32,137
I'll take responsibility for you.

301
00:24:34,890 --> 00:24:38,059
My word, it looks like
Cheol-hui will get married!

302
00:24:46,943 --> 00:24:48,361
Hello.

303
00:24:49,321 --> 00:24:50,739
I'd better get going.

304
00:24:50,822 --> 00:24:51,907
What?

305
00:24:51,990 --> 00:24:55,869
We're leaving,
so finish what you were doing.

306
00:24:58,955 --> 00:25:02,709
But what you brings you here?

307
00:25:03,710 --> 00:25:05,212
We came to see the twins

308
00:25:05,295 --> 00:25:07,964
and to see your special lady, Cheol-hui.

309
00:25:09,382 --> 00:25:11,927
Miss, we made a few
of your favorite side dishes.

310
00:25:12,010 --> 00:25:13,637
Excuse me?

311
00:25:13,720 --> 00:25:15,222
Make sure to have some.

312
00:25:15,305 --> 00:25:18,058
I guess it's time for us
to let go of Cheol-hui.

313
00:25:24,272 --> 00:25:25,273
The cab is here.

314
00:25:25,774 --> 00:25:27,776
In any case, congratulations.

315
00:25:27,859 --> 00:25:30,028
We'll talk more in detail later.

316
00:25:30,904 --> 00:25:31,780
- Okay.
- Good.

317
00:25:31,863 --> 00:25:33,156
- Let's go.
- See you then.

318
00:25:33,240 --> 00:25:35,367
- Goodbye.
- Take care.

319
00:25:36,076 --> 00:25:37,619
Hurry and get in.

320
00:25:39,871 --> 00:25:40,872
See you.

321
00:26:11,278 --> 00:26:13,029
I'm sorry for making you come twice.

322
00:26:17,575 --> 00:26:20,578
Ms. Jeong is adamant
about doing things her way.

323
00:26:20,662 --> 00:26:22,789
I ask for your kind understanding.

324
00:26:22,872 --> 00:26:26,501
You see, Ms. Jeong is
Ms. Oh In-a's manager.

325
00:26:29,504 --> 00:26:30,964
It's okay.

326
00:26:31,047 --> 00:26:33,758
It's a city hall project,
so you should be meticulous.

327
00:26:38,305 --> 00:26:41,641
What's his deal? Why is he staring at me?

328
00:26:41,725 --> 00:26:43,601
MARRIAGE IS A RESPONSIBILITY

329
00:26:43,685 --> 00:26:46,229
You wrote that marriage
is a responsibility.

330
00:26:47,856 --> 00:26:48,857
Yes.

331
00:26:49,983 --> 00:26:50,984
Obviously.

332
00:26:57,866 --> 00:27:02,495
"A couple must feel responsible
for each other in a marriage."

333
00:27:02,579 --> 00:27:05,415
I think that's what you said last time.

334
00:27:05,498 --> 00:27:09,961
I meant that people who can
take responsibility should be together.

335
00:27:10,795 --> 00:27:14,049
There are so many people who can't
take responsibility for themselves.

336
00:27:14,132 --> 00:27:17,010
People who judge others
but don't know their own place.

337
00:27:18,595 --> 00:27:21,056
"People who don't know their own place"?

338
00:27:21,639 --> 00:27:24,017
If you think about it in the extreme, yes.

339
00:27:25,518 --> 00:27:26,728
You're right.

340
00:27:26,811 --> 00:27:30,315
Mature adults shouldn't act that way.

341
00:27:34,110 --> 00:27:35,987
Is there anything else you want to know?

342
00:27:37,614 --> 00:27:40,575
Have we met by any chance?

343
00:27:40,658 --> 00:27:42,035
You look familiar.

344
00:27:44,704 --> 00:27:45,955
Ms. Jeong.

345
00:27:47,749 --> 00:27:50,585
You shouldn't ask personal questions here.

346
00:27:54,506 --> 00:27:56,174
If you live in Injeong City,

347
00:27:57,759 --> 00:28:00,178
it's possible we've run into each other.

348
00:28:08,645 --> 00:28:11,147
You sent a match request to Ms. Oh.

349
00:28:11,231 --> 00:28:13,566
Is there a particular place
you'd like to meet?

350
00:28:17,612 --> 00:28:19,322
I'd like somewhere private.

351
00:28:20,907 --> 00:28:22,784
I don't like having people around me.

352
00:28:23,368 --> 00:28:26,913
If Ms. Oh agrees to it,
will it be possible to see her alone?

353
00:28:29,165 --> 00:28:32,585
I'm afraid that goes against
our program's regulations.

354
00:28:35,004 --> 00:28:36,005
Is that so?

355
00:28:39,175 --> 00:28:43,054
Are you saying that no one has
ever met each other in private before?

356
00:28:46,266 --> 00:28:49,394
There was just one time when it happened.
Right, Ms. Jeong?

357
00:28:58,820 --> 00:29:02,115
It looks like I've come
just at the right time…

358
00:29:02,198 --> 00:29:03,783
Or not.

359
00:29:06,453 --> 00:29:07,454
Hello, sir.

360
00:29:07,537 --> 00:29:09,289
- Hello, sir.
- Yes, hello there.

361
00:29:11,040 --> 00:29:12,959
Don't mind me. Feel free to be at ease.

362
00:29:14,961 --> 00:29:17,046
Where's Mr. Choi?

363
00:29:17,130 --> 00:29:19,174
He's attending an out-of-office meeting.

364
00:29:19,257 --> 00:29:21,176
Is he now?

365
00:29:21,760 --> 00:29:24,262
Shall I send word
that you're looking for him?

366
00:29:24,345 --> 00:29:27,599
No, that won't be necessary.

367
00:29:30,727 --> 00:29:33,563
- Hurry up and contact him.
- But he said not to.

368
00:29:33,646 --> 00:29:35,982
- Hurry!
- Just wait a second.

369
00:29:37,066 --> 00:29:39,986
I see there's a consultation
going on in the meeting room.

370
00:29:41,029 --> 00:29:42,113
Yes, sir.

371
00:29:42,197 --> 00:29:45,784
It's the man who sent a heart
to Ms. Oh of Dyan Group.

372
00:29:48,244 --> 00:29:49,829
If you need something done,

373
00:29:49,913 --> 00:29:52,165
should I go in and get Mr. Yang?

374
00:29:52,248 --> 00:29:54,918
No, that won't be necessary.

375
00:29:55,001 --> 00:29:56,503
- It's okay.
- Yes, sir.

376
00:30:04,302 --> 00:30:07,972
- Just be at ease.
- Okay, sir.

377
00:30:08,056 --> 00:30:10,183
- I'll take my leave then.
- Yes, sir.

378
00:30:10,266 --> 00:30:11,392
- Take it easy.
- Goodbye.

379
00:30:11,476 --> 00:30:12,644
- Goodbye, sir.
- Bye.

380
00:30:23,655 --> 00:30:25,740
I'll let you know
if she accepts the match.

381
00:30:27,784 --> 00:30:28,827
What's going on?

382
00:30:28,910 --> 00:30:30,662
Did somebody stop by?

383
00:30:30,745 --> 00:30:32,080
The mayor did, sir.

384
00:30:32,163 --> 00:30:35,333
The mayor?
You should've come and gotten me!

385
00:30:35,416 --> 00:30:38,753
We wanted to, but he said
to feel free and be at ease.

386
00:30:38,837 --> 00:30:40,463
You should've felt free to get me!

387
00:30:40,547 --> 00:30:44,175
How could I when the mayor told me not to?

388
00:30:46,511 --> 00:30:47,846
I'm counting on you.

389
00:30:47,929 --> 00:30:49,597
Okay. Goodbye then.

390
00:30:57,897 --> 00:31:01,025
We reexamined Mr. Joo Dong-seok.

391
00:31:01,109 --> 00:31:03,736
You can think it through
before making a decision.

392
00:31:10,577 --> 00:31:13,079
JOO DONG-SEOK, 29 YEARS OLD

393
00:31:13,162 --> 00:31:16,875
MARRIAGE IS A RESPONSIBILITY

394
00:31:17,667 --> 00:31:19,419
"Marriage is a responsibility"?

395
00:31:23,298 --> 00:31:26,718
That's not half bad.

396
00:31:30,305 --> 00:31:32,682
MATCH ACCEPTED

397
00:31:45,862 --> 00:31:47,196
What about you, Ms. Oh?

398
00:31:48,197 --> 00:31:49,824
I like watching movies.

399
00:31:50,783 --> 00:31:52,118
I like movies too.

400
00:31:53,453 --> 00:31:56,164
I really hope this turns out well.

401
00:31:56,247 --> 00:31:59,542
You must really mean it this time.

402
00:31:59,626 --> 00:32:02,045
I can tell that you're
seriously pulling for him.

403
00:32:02,128 --> 00:32:04,172
I've always meant it.

404
00:32:04,255 --> 00:32:06,716
It's just that if this works out,

405
00:32:06,799 --> 00:32:09,093
it'll double my job performance figures.

406
00:32:20,605 --> 00:32:24,108
What's your dating style, Mr. Joo?

407
00:32:27,570 --> 00:32:29,781
I haven't dated much, so I'm not sure.

408
00:32:31,991 --> 00:32:35,203
What do you mean
that you haven't dated much?

409
00:32:35,954 --> 00:32:38,456
I feel more comfortable
around my guy friends,

410
00:32:38,539 --> 00:32:39,958
so I have little experience.

411
00:32:40,541 --> 00:32:41,542
I see.

412
00:32:43,503 --> 00:32:45,171
I did a long time ago.

413
00:32:46,172 --> 00:32:47,465
But it didn't end well.

414
00:32:48,174 --> 00:32:50,009
It didn't end well?

415
00:32:53,221 --> 00:32:55,223
It wasn't my fault though.

416
00:32:57,100 --> 00:33:00,853
I hope you don't think I approached you
because of your background.

417
00:33:03,439 --> 00:33:08,152
I felt a connection with you
when I read your profile card.

418
00:33:08,236 --> 00:33:09,529
That's why I took a chance.

419
00:33:14,117 --> 00:33:16,536
Mr. Joo seems sincere, right?

420
00:33:16,619 --> 00:33:20,331
What do you think, Ms. Jeong?
Do you think it'll go well?

421
00:33:21,791 --> 00:33:23,835
He does seem sincere.

422
00:33:29,048 --> 00:33:32,010
But why are there
so many posts like these?

423
00:33:32,093 --> 00:33:35,054
DYAN'S EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR'S
FACE SAYS IT ALL

424
00:33:35,138 --> 00:33:36,723
CITY HALL IS WASTING
TAXPAYER MONEY

425
00:33:36,806 --> 00:33:37,807
YES, IT'S DISGUSTING

426
00:33:37,890 --> 00:33:40,893
Popularity always comes at a cost.

427
00:33:40,977 --> 00:33:43,438
It just means the promotion is going well.

428
00:33:45,356 --> 00:33:46,733
But this is just…

429
00:33:47,483 --> 00:33:50,695
MEN, DON'T FALL FOR WOMEN
WHO APPEAR IN THIS PROGRAM

430
00:34:00,079 --> 00:34:02,290
Have a good night, then.

431
00:34:02,373 --> 00:34:03,624
I'll take you home.

432
00:34:04,250 --> 00:34:05,334
Why?

433
00:34:08,004 --> 00:34:11,132
I'm not ready to say goodbye,
and it's rather late.

434
00:34:13,051 --> 00:34:15,094
Did you watch the news today?

435
00:34:15,178 --> 00:34:17,055
Women need to be careful at night.

436
00:34:18,222 --> 00:34:19,682
I see.

437
00:34:19,766 --> 00:34:22,518
I'll be fine though. My secretary is here.

438
00:34:34,197 --> 00:34:36,032
See you again then.

439
00:34:52,799 --> 00:34:55,843
Ms. Oh said she'll see him again, right?

440
00:34:55,927 --> 00:34:58,387
Yes, Mr. Yang. Your hunch was right.

441
00:34:58,471 --> 00:35:00,473
Of course it was. I'm that good.

442
00:35:06,854 --> 00:35:08,481
Now for the next incident report.

443
00:35:08,564 --> 00:35:11,901
There has been a series of assaults

444
00:35:11,984 --> 00:35:15,196
targeting women in their 20s and 30s
walking alone at night.

445
00:35:15,279 --> 00:35:18,658
Misogynistic online communities
continue to support these crimes.

446
00:35:18,741 --> 00:35:22,787
Many are getting increasingly fearful
of such random attacks.

447
00:35:23,788 --> 00:35:27,917
What words end with "-iss"?

448
00:35:29,502 --> 00:35:33,005
There's Swiss, miss, bliss

449
00:35:33,089 --> 00:35:34,298
And kiss!

450
00:35:36,008 --> 00:35:37,593
It looks like Ha-na is coming!

451
00:35:37,677 --> 00:35:39,762
Now it's up to us.

452
00:35:39,846 --> 00:35:43,015
Right. We can't let her
take back the kiss.

453
00:35:48,646 --> 00:35:50,690
I'm coming, Ha-na!

454
00:35:51,440 --> 00:35:52,650
Here you are.

455
00:36:12,211 --> 00:36:13,921
Why aren't you guys eating?

456
00:36:14,964 --> 00:36:16,966
- Oh, right.
- Right.

457
00:36:21,179 --> 00:36:23,890
Go to the next step already.

458
00:36:24,849 --> 00:36:28,436
You guys kissed,
so what else is there left to do?

459
00:36:34,317 --> 00:36:35,735
How did you find out?

460
00:36:35,818 --> 00:36:37,528
You made it so obvious.

461
00:36:37,612 --> 00:36:39,655
You'd have to be blind not to know.

462
00:36:39,739 --> 00:36:41,407
The rumors have reached Cheongdo.

463
00:36:43,201 --> 00:36:44,202
Cheol-hui!

464
00:36:45,244 --> 00:36:48,539
I was going to tell them here tonight.

465
00:36:49,624 --> 00:36:50,625
Ha-na.

466
00:36:51,626 --> 00:36:53,794
How much do you like our uncle?

467
00:36:54,378 --> 00:36:57,173
Do you love him to the moon and back?

468
00:36:57,256 --> 00:36:58,382
Come on.

469
00:36:58,466 --> 00:37:02,637
Uncle, she's your responsibility. Got it?

470
00:37:02,720 --> 00:37:04,138
Hey, cut it out!

471
00:37:04,222 --> 00:37:06,599
You'll give Ha-na indigestion.

472
00:37:06,682 --> 00:37:08,601
- Please eat.
- Thank you.

473
00:37:12,188 --> 00:37:13,564
By the way,

474
00:37:13,648 --> 00:37:15,816
how much do you like me, Ha-na?

475
00:37:15,900 --> 00:37:17,652
Seriously!

476
00:37:19,445 --> 00:37:20,905
I'm curious too.

477
00:37:28,454 --> 00:37:29,622
I like your uncle…

478
00:37:31,415 --> 00:37:33,125
lots and lots.

479
00:37:33,918 --> 00:37:36,128
- She said, "lots and lots"!
- "Lots and lots"!

480
00:37:40,341 --> 00:37:42,510
So just how much is lots and lots?

481
00:37:42,593 --> 00:37:43,844
This much!

482
00:37:52,103 --> 00:37:55,856
Thanks to Dyan's sponsorship,
there's an increase in male applicants.

483
00:37:56,399 --> 00:38:00,027
But as you can see,
there's also an increase in hate comments.

484
00:38:01,445 --> 00:38:03,990
Ms. Lee was the best
at handling complaints like that.

485
00:38:04,073 --> 00:38:07,618
I know. It's a shame she's not here.

486
00:38:08,703 --> 00:38:10,663
What do you think, Mr. Yang?

487
00:38:11,289 --> 00:38:15,251
We need to track them down
and block their access.

488
00:38:16,127 --> 00:38:18,504
- Right.
- I'm a cut above Ms. Lee

489
00:38:18,587 --> 00:38:21,215
when it comes to processing complaints.

490
00:38:22,758 --> 00:38:25,011
Then we should proceed as you say.

491
00:38:25,094 --> 00:38:27,138
Yes, of course.

492
00:38:27,221 --> 00:38:29,223
Then you'll take charge of this matter.

493
00:38:29,307 --> 00:38:30,349
LET'S GO ON A DATE

494
00:38:30,433 --> 00:38:32,226
Excuse me?

495
00:38:33,227 --> 00:38:37,106
Will Ms. Oh and Mr. Joo's second date
take place this weekend?

496
00:38:40,151 --> 00:38:42,528
Okay. See you this weekend.

497
00:38:43,154 --> 00:38:44,447
Ms. Jeong?

498
00:38:45,698 --> 00:38:46,699
What?

499
00:38:48,326 --> 00:38:50,328
Oh, right.

500
00:38:50,411 --> 00:38:53,539
The applicants agreed to see each other,

501
00:38:53,622 --> 00:38:57,001
but they haven't exchanged numbers yet,
so I passed on the necessary details.

502
00:38:58,336 --> 00:39:01,714
Okay. Let's end our meeting then.

503
00:39:01,797 --> 00:39:03,924
- Yes, sir.
- Thank you.

504
00:39:04,008 --> 00:39:05,509
- Good work.
- Thank you.

505
00:39:11,724 --> 00:39:13,684
- Ms. Jeong?
- Yes?

506
00:39:13,768 --> 00:39:15,019
Are you dating someone?

507
00:39:15,102 --> 00:39:16,354
What?

508
00:39:16,854 --> 00:39:18,439
No.

509
00:39:18,522 --> 00:39:20,816
Why don't I believe you?

510
00:39:21,942 --> 00:39:24,320
Your face looks different too.

511
00:39:28,157 --> 00:39:30,242
Lucky you.

512
00:39:43,547 --> 00:39:44,548
Here you go, Ha-na.

513
00:39:45,341 --> 00:39:46,342
It's hot.

514
00:39:57,103 --> 00:40:00,523
Does my face look different today?

515
00:40:00,606 --> 00:40:01,774
What?

516
00:40:02,316 --> 00:40:04,443
Yes. A lot.

517
00:40:07,196 --> 00:40:09,532
Did something change?

518
00:40:09,615 --> 00:40:11,534
I'm not sure if I see it.

519
00:40:17,581 --> 00:40:18,749
You two…

520
00:40:21,419 --> 00:40:22,628
decided to date, right?

521
00:40:22,711 --> 00:40:24,422
When is day one for you guys?

522
00:40:25,506 --> 00:40:28,676
Have rumors spread already?

523
00:40:29,844 --> 00:40:31,262
That's not good.

524
00:40:32,096 --> 00:40:35,683
"I'm dating" is written
all over your face.

525
00:40:35,766 --> 00:40:39,937
And you're grinning from ear to ear.

526
00:40:43,065 --> 00:40:46,986
Actually, when I was
texting you at the office,

527
00:40:47,069 --> 00:40:49,947
I found myself smiling.

528
00:40:52,825 --> 00:40:55,453
But I think Ji-won saw that.

529
00:40:55,536 --> 00:40:58,539
I'm trying to be cautious
especially around the office.

530
00:41:02,376 --> 00:41:04,211
If you're being cautious,

531
00:41:04,962 --> 00:41:07,214
then I have an idea.

532
00:41:26,650 --> 00:41:28,402
I should've gone to the dermatologist.

533
00:41:45,878 --> 00:41:49,882
SECRET DATES

534
00:42:03,062 --> 00:42:05,356
Wow, my skin is so smooth.

535
00:42:05,856 --> 00:42:08,817
I can't believe I have to
cover up my glowing skin.

536
00:42:11,779 --> 00:42:13,864
You can pass as a high school student.

537
00:42:14,365 --> 00:42:15,741
Do I look good?

538
00:42:15,824 --> 00:42:17,535
You can be a middle schooler.

539
00:42:18,410 --> 00:42:20,454
You look good too, Cheol-hui.

540
00:42:20,538 --> 00:42:21,789
I'm a little embarrassed.

541
00:42:23,958 --> 00:42:25,709
Ha-na, come with me.

542
00:42:36,303 --> 00:42:37,304
Come here.

543
00:42:42,977 --> 00:42:43,978
Here we go.

544
00:42:48,482 --> 00:42:51,819
We're in trouble because you look
even more beautiful today.

545
00:42:51,902 --> 00:42:52,987
Why is that?

546
00:42:53,070 --> 00:42:56,073
I spent extra time getting ready for you.

547
00:42:57,950 --> 00:42:59,243
Hold on.

548
00:43:00,202 --> 00:43:01,328
These here.

549
00:43:01,870 --> 00:43:03,038
Try these on.

550
00:43:07,001 --> 00:43:08,794
You can't tell it's me, right?

551
00:43:10,796 --> 00:43:12,172
You're pretty.

552
00:43:12,256 --> 00:43:15,134
Come on, you said that
we have to disguise ourselves.

553
00:43:15,217 --> 00:43:16,719
That's right. A disguise.

554
00:43:19,722 --> 00:43:22,057
A disguise. What do you think?

555
00:43:22,141 --> 00:43:23,183
They look good on you.

556
00:43:23,267 --> 00:43:24,351
- Really?
- Yes.

557
00:43:24,435 --> 00:43:26,895
Excuse me, we'll buy these three items.

558
00:43:31,483 --> 00:43:34,403
- Mr. Han is over there.
- Mr. Han?

559
00:43:35,321 --> 00:43:37,072
No, don't look.

560
00:43:38,240 --> 00:43:39,950
Don't look!

561
00:43:43,621 --> 00:43:45,956
Honey, shall we go to a café?

562
00:43:48,334 --> 00:43:49,460
"Honey"?

563
00:43:50,878 --> 00:43:52,296
- Let's go.
- Okay.

564
00:43:59,094 --> 00:44:00,596
That was a close call.

565
00:44:01,221 --> 00:44:02,890
Honey.

566
00:44:02,973 --> 00:44:04,266
Cheol-hui!

567
00:44:05,893 --> 00:44:09,271
Honey, will you have a coffee with me?

568
00:44:10,439 --> 00:44:11,690
Sure.

569
00:44:11,774 --> 00:44:14,360
- Let's go.
- Okay.

570
00:44:40,344 --> 00:44:42,137
- Hello?
- Yes?

571
00:44:42,221 --> 00:44:45,641
Mr. Joo and I were supposed to meet
at 5 p.m., but he's still not here.

572
00:44:45,724 --> 00:44:47,476
It's been ten minutes.

573
00:44:47,559 --> 00:44:50,145
Yes, we agreed to meet at Central Park.

574
00:44:50,813 --> 00:44:53,982
Central Park?
Not Incheon Open Port Street?

575
00:44:54,775 --> 00:44:58,529
Mr. Joo called this morning
to change locations.

576
00:44:59,571 --> 00:45:00,614
Hold on.

577
00:45:00,697 --> 00:45:03,283
I got in a small accident on the way,
so I'm running late.

578
00:45:03,367 --> 00:45:04,743
I'm almost there.

579
00:45:05,702 --> 00:45:08,163
He says he got into
a small accident on the way here.

580
00:45:08,247 --> 00:45:09,790
He'll be here soon.

581
00:45:09,873 --> 00:45:12,751
But when did you two exchange numbers?

582
00:45:13,377 --> 00:45:14,378
What?

583
00:45:14,878 --> 00:45:16,046
Ms. Oh!

584
00:45:20,217 --> 00:45:21,844
Is something the matter?

585
00:45:26,682 --> 00:45:29,476
I think we can stay in this boat longer.

586
00:45:30,811 --> 00:45:32,438
A longer date sounds good to me.

587
00:45:33,021 --> 00:45:35,441
But I also think I should leave right now.

588
00:45:36,692 --> 00:45:37,776
Right now?

589
00:45:39,319 --> 00:45:43,031
Ms. Oh is at Central Park
on a date at the moment.

590
00:45:43,115 --> 00:45:45,993
Doesn't that mean we should stay here?

591
00:45:48,620 --> 00:45:50,539
Will it be possible to see her alone?

592
00:45:50,622 --> 00:45:52,791
I don't like having people around me.

593
00:45:55,669 --> 00:45:59,298
There's something strange
about her blind date,

594
00:45:59,381 --> 00:46:01,008
so I'm worried about her.

595
00:46:02,676 --> 00:46:03,677
What?

596
00:46:09,641 --> 00:46:13,061
What a shame.
I thought a boat ride would be fun.

597
00:46:16,148 --> 00:46:18,192
We're still awkward around each other.

598
00:46:19,026 --> 00:46:20,819
Is this what they call irony?

599
00:46:21,862 --> 00:46:24,781
You're wearing a short skirt
and look all dolled up,

600
00:46:24,865 --> 00:46:26,992
so I thought you'd agree to anything.

601
00:46:28,660 --> 00:46:30,913
Why would you think that?

602
00:46:30,996 --> 00:46:32,581
This is only our second date.

603
00:46:39,338 --> 00:46:41,381
Darn it, what are they saying?

604
00:46:41,465 --> 00:46:43,759
I think he said something
about a short skirt.

605
00:46:43,842 --> 00:46:46,220
Why in the world would anyone

606
00:46:46,303 --> 00:46:48,472
talk about short skirts on a blind date?

607
00:47:00,359 --> 00:47:03,987
Doesn't it seem like he got caught
trying to do something?

608
00:47:04,071 --> 00:47:05,072
What?

609
00:47:06,156 --> 00:47:07,157
Hold on a second.

610
00:47:14,373 --> 00:47:16,250
He's not doing anything right now.

611
00:47:29,263 --> 00:47:31,640
Going on a date isn't easy.

612
00:47:33,350 --> 00:47:36,270
But I always have fun when I'm with you.

613
00:47:38,605 --> 00:47:39,648
Let's see.

614
00:47:52,369 --> 00:47:53,495
Thank you.

615
00:47:58,333 --> 00:48:00,502
I'm not good at holding back my curiosity.

616
00:48:02,087 --> 00:48:04,590
You told me before

617
00:48:04,673 --> 00:48:06,758
that you broke up
because of the other person.

618
00:48:07,384 --> 00:48:09,469
And that you haven't dated much,

619
00:48:10,178 --> 00:48:12,097
so you don't know your dating style.

620
00:48:13,098 --> 00:48:15,225
Right. What about it?

621
00:48:17,603 --> 00:48:19,313
What was the problem?

622
00:48:22,274 --> 00:48:23,483
I think it's something

623
00:48:24,443 --> 00:48:29,197
that will help determine
if we should keep seeing each other.

624
00:48:33,160 --> 00:48:35,746
I was just an ATM to my ex.

625
00:48:36,830 --> 00:48:39,124
It was okay at first because I liked her,

626
00:48:39,958 --> 00:48:41,627
but it got progressively worse.

627
00:48:43,587 --> 00:48:44,963
When I asked for a breakup…

628
00:48:48,925 --> 00:48:51,637
she told me she was pregnant
and to take responsibility.

629
00:48:55,432 --> 00:49:00,687
Even if the relationship didn't work,
you're still responsible for the child.

630
00:49:01,521 --> 00:49:03,982
I didn't think it was mine
because the dates were off.

631
00:49:07,361 --> 00:49:09,696
She was cheating on me with someone else.

632
00:49:12,491 --> 00:49:16,620
Why did she tell you
instead of going to that other man?

633
00:49:19,289 --> 00:49:20,582
I think he abandoned her.

634
00:49:23,585 --> 00:49:26,630
There was no sense of responsibility
in their relationship.

635
00:49:31,385 --> 00:49:33,261
That sounds like a soap opera.

636
00:49:34,346 --> 00:49:36,431
After that, I was afraid to be with women.

637
00:49:40,686 --> 00:49:42,187
After an experience like that,

638
00:49:43,021 --> 00:49:45,315
it must be hard to meet someone.

639
00:49:47,526 --> 00:49:50,153
Marriage is a responsibility.

640
00:49:50,237 --> 00:49:52,489
Sending you a match request

641
00:49:52,572 --> 00:49:55,158
took a lot of courage on my part.

642
00:49:58,829 --> 00:50:00,414
So, that's why you said

643
00:50:00,497 --> 00:50:05,043
you were struck by my profile card.

644
00:50:07,671 --> 00:50:09,381
Marriage is a responsibility.

645
00:50:17,264 --> 00:50:18,974
I think we can leave now.

646
00:50:20,726 --> 00:50:21,852
Okay.

647
00:50:32,738 --> 00:50:34,156
Do you see something?

648
00:50:36,783 --> 00:50:38,535
I thought I recognized someone.

649
00:50:41,288 --> 00:50:43,540
Is it okay to have dinner in private now?

650
00:50:47,544 --> 00:50:48,754
Yes.

651
00:50:54,342 --> 00:50:56,845
Goodness, this is sour.

652
00:50:58,930 --> 00:51:00,974
This is nice.

653
00:51:01,725 --> 00:51:04,644
Hold on. Isn't that Cheol-hui?

654
00:51:04,728 --> 00:51:07,063
Hey, Bong Cheol-hui!

655
00:51:08,648 --> 00:51:10,400
- What?
- Goodness.

656
00:51:11,526 --> 00:51:12,611
You're so busted!

657
00:51:13,278 --> 00:51:14,780
Come over here already.

658
00:51:18,366 --> 00:51:20,243
- Okay.
- Hello.

659
00:51:21,661 --> 00:51:23,789
My goodness.

660
00:51:26,416 --> 00:51:31,004
Why haven't you two
returned to Cheongdo yet?

661
00:51:31,087 --> 00:51:32,631
Did you fight with your husband?

662
00:51:32,714 --> 00:51:36,009
I'm still here
because I can't stand that man.

663
00:51:36,802 --> 00:51:40,931
So I might as well enjoy
a nice long staycation before I go back.

664
00:51:42,098 --> 00:51:44,518
So, you're here because
you fought with your husband?

665
00:51:44,601 --> 00:51:47,270
Don't get married, young lady.

666
00:51:47,354 --> 00:51:51,191
Everything men say
before they seal the deal is a lie.

667
00:51:51,274 --> 00:51:53,860
Hey, what are you saying to Ha-na?

668
00:51:54,528 --> 00:51:56,196
Pretend you didn't hear that.

669
00:51:58,198 --> 00:52:00,575
Isn't it uncomfortable
to be away from home?

670
00:52:00,659 --> 00:52:03,620
It's probably uncomfortable
for my husband.

671
00:52:03,703 --> 00:52:06,414
Why did he have to go and cause trouble?

672
00:52:07,791 --> 00:52:09,918
What kind of trouble did he get into?

673
00:52:10,001 --> 00:52:14,422
He sold his boat,
saying he wanted to open a music bar.

674
00:52:15,215 --> 00:52:19,302
"A music bar"?
Isn't that just a regular bar?

675
00:52:19,386 --> 00:52:25,642
Yes. He spent his whole life
working on the boat to raise our kids,

676
00:52:25,725 --> 00:52:29,396
but something came over him.
Now he keeps talking about his dream.

677
00:52:29,479 --> 00:52:33,775
But he even quit smoking to help pay
for the kids' private tutoring.

678
00:52:36,069 --> 00:52:40,198
Right. I have a bucket list too.

679
00:52:41,032 --> 00:52:45,704
Can I make sacrifices like that
for my own family?

680
00:52:45,787 --> 00:52:47,539
If nothing else,

681
00:52:47,622 --> 00:52:51,543
my husband had a strong sense
of responsibility to his family.

682
00:52:51,626 --> 00:52:55,964
But now he's saying
he'll support us by running a music bar.

683
00:52:56,047 --> 00:52:59,301
I don't know whether to trust him or not.

684
00:52:59,384 --> 00:53:01,511
It seems like you already are.

685
00:53:02,178 --> 00:53:04,389
Everything here is for him.

686
00:53:04,472 --> 00:53:05,640
No, that's just--

687
00:53:05,724 --> 00:53:08,643
What's this? Is this for me then?

688
00:53:09,227 --> 00:53:12,731
That'll look good on my husband, right?

689
00:53:13,565 --> 00:53:16,610
She's always like this, you know.

690
00:53:17,235 --> 00:53:19,487
He's going to love this.

691
00:53:20,155 --> 00:53:21,990
He'll be the fashionista of Cheongdo.

692
00:53:22,741 --> 00:53:25,201
You got him a gift
even though you can't stand him?

693
00:53:25,285 --> 00:53:27,621
I can't stand him, but what can I do?

694
00:53:27,704 --> 00:53:30,332
We announced to all of our relatives

695
00:53:30,415 --> 00:53:33,293
we'd take responsibility
for each other's faults.

696
00:53:33,376 --> 00:53:36,504
I just wish he wouldn't
cause trouble like this.

697
00:53:36,588 --> 00:53:37,964
You're right.

698
00:53:38,048 --> 00:53:40,717
Being married means
taking full responsibility

699
00:53:40,800 --> 00:53:43,511
for unpredictable situations
and overcoming them.

700
00:53:44,512 --> 00:53:46,139
Don't worry, Ha-na.

701
00:53:47,223 --> 00:53:50,435
I'm good at living a predictable life.

702
00:53:52,437 --> 00:53:56,483
Marriage means
not being in control of my life.

703
00:53:56,566 --> 00:53:59,819
I'd forgotten this for a moment.

704
00:54:00,654 --> 00:54:02,280
A husband is reassuring to have,

705
00:54:02,364 --> 00:54:06,034
but when he's not around, you feel empty.

706
00:54:06,117 --> 00:54:09,371
You'll know what I mean
after you get married.

707
00:54:10,455 --> 00:54:12,749
Ha-na, you don't need to know that.

708
00:54:12,832 --> 00:54:14,417
I'll take full responsibility.

709
00:54:15,210 --> 00:54:20,048
Look at that.
Cheol-hui is grinning from ear to ear.

710
00:54:22,676 --> 00:54:26,680
So, have you two set a date?

711
00:54:28,014 --> 00:54:31,726
Can I really get married?

712
00:54:39,943 --> 00:54:44,364
INJEONG CITY
GOODBYE INJEONG

713
00:54:46,574 --> 00:54:48,243
Where are we going right now?

714
00:54:49,119 --> 00:54:51,079
I know a good restaurant.

715
00:54:52,330 --> 00:54:53,999
Is it far from here?

716
00:54:54,082 --> 00:54:57,002
No, we'll be there soon.

717
00:54:58,670 --> 00:55:00,255
Okay.

718
00:55:28,158 --> 00:55:31,077
Cheol-hui, have you made a life plan?

719
00:55:31,995 --> 00:55:33,747
A life plan?

720
00:55:34,581 --> 00:55:37,542
Do you mean how I'm going
to make a living and such things?

721
00:55:37,625 --> 00:55:38,626
Yes.

722
00:55:41,713 --> 00:55:43,882
Before I met you,

723
00:55:43,965 --> 00:55:48,470
I thought raising the twins well
was my entire life.

724
00:55:49,679 --> 00:55:51,014
What about now?

725
00:55:52,557 --> 00:55:54,017
Well, now…

726
00:55:55,727 --> 00:55:57,812
Now that you're in my life,

727
00:55:58,646 --> 00:56:00,523
I want to plan it with you.

728
00:56:03,693 --> 00:56:04,819
Right.

729
00:56:05,612 --> 00:56:07,947
Now I have to think
about our future together

730
00:56:08,656 --> 00:56:11,034
and not just my own life.

731
00:56:19,375 --> 00:56:20,668
What about you, Ha-na?

732
00:56:23,630 --> 00:56:26,007
Do you have any other plans?

733
00:56:29,636 --> 00:56:31,137
Let's just take our time.

734
00:56:32,138 --> 00:56:34,682
I've already made up my mind anyway.

735
00:56:38,436 --> 00:56:43,233
It's a relationship that requires more
than having feelings for each other.

736
00:56:44,651 --> 00:56:46,319
It requires

737
00:56:46,402 --> 00:56:49,572
the determination to be responsible
for each other forever.

738
00:56:50,573 --> 00:56:55,453
I think I'm qualified to get married now.

739
00:56:57,914 --> 00:56:59,541
Thanks to you,

740
00:57:01,000 --> 00:57:03,294
I figured out
what those qualifications are.

741
00:57:06,172 --> 00:57:10,051
Can I accept

742
00:57:10,635 --> 00:57:12,637
this person's life?

743
00:58:31,007 --> 00:58:32,300
She hasn't called home.

744
00:58:32,383 --> 00:58:34,302
He's not that kind of person.

745
00:58:34,385 --> 00:58:36,304
You should've kept to yourself.

746
00:58:36,387 --> 00:58:40,058
We've received this many hate comments
from yesterday morning until 2 p.m.

747
00:58:40,141 --> 00:58:41,309
Track down the IP address.

748
00:58:41,392 --> 00:58:43,770
This looks like Ms. Jeong's address.

749
00:58:43,853 --> 00:58:46,147
I want you to prove who you were with

750
00:58:46,231 --> 00:58:49,150
and what you were doing
when all of those posts were made.

751
00:58:49,234 --> 00:58:51,277
This isn't something you can hide.

752
00:58:51,361 --> 00:58:53,446
Did you hate the team this much?

753
00:58:53,530 --> 00:58:55,907
I can't say anything right now.

754
00:58:55,990 --> 00:58:58,785
Did Ms. Jeong ever seem suspicious to you?

755
00:58:58,868 --> 00:59:00,453
You can't suspect her like this!

756
00:59:00,537 --> 00:59:01,579
I have proof.

757
00:59:01,663 --> 00:59:02,705
What brings you here?

758
00:59:03,414 --> 00:59:05,041
Do you need money or something?

759
00:59:05,124 --> 00:59:06,751
I'll take care of it myself.

760
00:59:06,834 --> 00:59:08,461
It's my problem after all.

761
00:59:08,545 --> 00:59:11,256
Ha-na, no matter what you say,

762
00:59:11,339 --> 00:59:12,507
I'm on your side.

763
00:59:14,634 --> 00:59:17,136
It's because I feel guilty towards you.

764
00:59:17,762 --> 00:59:19,556
It's enough for me

765
00:59:19,639 --> 00:59:22,850
to be by your side
when you're having a hard time.

766
00:59:23,685 --> 00:59:25,687
But what if I can't do the same?

767
00:59:26,354 --> 00:59:31,359
