1
00:00:36,578 --> 00:00:37,871
ALL CHARACTERS, ORGANIZATIONS,
AND PLACES ARE FICTITIOUS

2
00:00:37,954 --> 00:00:39,289
FILMING OF CHILD ACTORS DONE
UNDER BROADCASTING GUIDELINES

3
00:00:41,124 --> 00:00:42,167
Cheol-hui.

4
00:00:43,042 --> 00:00:44,627
What brings you here at this hour?

5
00:00:47,046 --> 00:00:48,131
Ha-na.

6
00:00:48,214 --> 00:00:49,591
Yes?

7
00:00:49,674 --> 00:00:53,011
There's something I must tell you.

8
00:00:54,512 --> 00:00:55,722
What is it?

9
00:00:56,723 --> 00:01:02,812
I'm… telling you this because I trust you.

10
00:01:06,024 --> 00:01:08,276
I have something to confess to you.

11
00:01:09,736 --> 00:01:11,029
You want to confess?

12
00:01:12,489 --> 00:01:14,157
I am…

13
00:01:17,035 --> 00:01:18,620
Who's that?

14
00:01:19,746 --> 00:01:20,747
Who's there?

15
00:01:26,920 --> 00:01:28,630
Cheol-hui, what's happening?

16
00:01:40,391 --> 00:01:43,937
GET LOST

17
00:01:47,357 --> 00:01:51,277
The dash cam did capture the culprit,

18
00:01:51,361 --> 00:01:54,781
but he was using an umbrella,
so we can't see his face clearly.

19
00:01:54,864 --> 00:01:57,700
A lot of teens are
into car vandalism nowadays,

20
00:01:57,784 --> 00:02:01,454
so it's highly likely that it was them
without malicious intent.

21
00:02:02,288 --> 00:02:06,626
The surveillance camera seemed
to be working until yesterday.

22
00:02:06,709 --> 00:02:09,420
I will get the dash cams
of the nearby cars too.

23
00:02:09,504 --> 00:02:12,048
We'll check the footage and let you know.

24
00:02:12,841 --> 00:02:13,883
Okay.

25
00:02:14,425 --> 00:02:15,844
- Let's go.
- Yes, sir.

26
00:02:30,775 --> 00:02:32,360
How did this happen?

27
00:02:33,111 --> 00:02:35,071
No wonder I kept feeling uneasy.

28
00:02:38,199 --> 00:02:39,409
Cheol-hui.

29
00:02:39,492 --> 00:02:40,451
Yes?

30
00:02:40,535 --> 00:02:42,912
What were you going to say just now?

31
00:02:44,247 --> 00:02:45,456
Well…

32
00:02:48,459 --> 00:02:49,544
Actually…

33
00:02:53,882 --> 00:02:56,217
It's about my past.

34
00:02:57,635 --> 00:03:01,973
I wanted to tell you about it honestly.

35
00:03:04,767 --> 00:03:05,894
Your past?

36
00:03:07,145 --> 00:03:12,317
Actually, until five years ago,
I worked as a firefighter.

37
00:03:15,570 --> 00:03:18,990
But after a big accident, I quit my job.

38
00:03:19,991 --> 00:03:23,912
Since then, I moved to the island
and lived there until now.

39
00:03:25,580 --> 00:03:30,209
I got the scar on my back
from that accident too.

40
00:03:36,799 --> 00:03:38,509
Dispatch, dispatch.

41
00:03:38,593 --> 00:03:41,262
We are searching the offices
in the building first.

42
00:03:41,346 --> 00:03:44,182
Search the chairperson's office
on the lower floor first.

43
00:03:45,058 --> 00:03:48,561
Injeong Zero Eight,
we'll arrive in five minutes.

44
00:03:58,071 --> 00:04:00,990
DA-BIN

45
00:04:01,074 --> 00:04:02,492
Hello, Da-bin.

46
00:04:03,326 --> 00:04:05,453
Where are you? What's taking you so long?

47
00:04:06,955 --> 00:04:08,498
I'm sorry.

48
00:04:08,581 --> 00:04:10,792
There's an emergency,

49
00:04:10,875 --> 00:04:13,336
and I'm being dispatched,
so I can't go to meet you.

50
00:04:13,419 --> 00:04:16,506
I postponed the meetup of our parents
twice because of you.

51
00:04:16,589 --> 00:04:18,174
Does nobody work besides you?

52
00:04:18,258 --> 00:04:19,759
I'm very sorry.

53
00:04:20,969 --> 00:04:23,805
I'll explain to our parents myself.

54
00:04:23,888 --> 00:04:25,848
You're always like this.

55
00:04:25,932 --> 00:04:28,268
You don't have the right to get married.

56
00:04:28,351 --> 00:04:31,479
Keep doing whatever you want to do.
I can't stand you anymore.

57
00:04:33,648 --> 00:04:35,817
- What?
- Injeong Zero Eight, hurry up.

58
00:04:35,900 --> 00:04:36,901
It's an emergency.

59
00:04:36,985 --> 00:04:39,654
- Da-bin.
- An imperiled person found.

60
00:04:39,737 --> 00:04:41,864
Injeong Zero Eight, where are you? Hurry.

61
00:04:47,954 --> 00:04:51,791
Why did those guys in suits come?

62
00:04:53,751 --> 00:04:54,919
Did you see them?

63
00:04:58,381 --> 00:05:02,593
They are the secretaries of the chairman
whom I saved from the accident.

64
00:05:04,095 --> 00:05:07,640
He saw me on social media
for the first time in a while.

65
00:05:07,724 --> 00:05:09,684
So I just went to say hello.

66
00:05:16,733 --> 00:05:19,527
There's a person that needs to be rescued!

67
00:05:19,610 --> 00:05:20,653
Chairman!

68
00:05:22,947 --> 00:05:24,490
Sir, are you okay?

69
00:05:30,038 --> 00:05:31,080
Sir.

70
00:05:51,976 --> 00:05:52,977
Sir.

71
00:05:53,853 --> 00:05:55,021
Let's get up.

72
00:06:06,365 --> 00:06:08,576
I saved Chairman Jin,

73
00:06:09,202 --> 00:06:13,831
but I belatedly found out my girlfriend
had died in a car accident on that day.

74
00:06:22,215 --> 00:06:25,802
If dating someone again was
that hard for you,

75
00:06:25,885 --> 00:06:28,304
I thought there must be a reason.

76
00:06:31,182 --> 00:06:34,435
Like something in the past
that's painful to recall.

77
00:06:36,145 --> 00:06:37,855
Just like me three years ago.

78
00:06:42,777 --> 00:06:45,947
Anyway, you're a good person,
not a bad one.

79
00:06:47,323 --> 00:06:49,408
You're a lifesaver, not a thug.

80
00:06:59,252 --> 00:07:01,420
Thank you for believing in me.

81
00:07:02,839 --> 00:07:03,965
It's okay.

82
00:07:04,048 --> 00:07:07,051
I know it wasn't easy. Thank you
for trusting and telling me anyway.

83
00:07:08,553 --> 00:07:11,472
I'm sorry for making you see
such an unpleasant sight.

84
00:07:11,556 --> 00:07:14,225
I'll look into this tomorrow again.

85
00:07:14,976 --> 00:07:16,853
Okay. I'll get going then.

86
00:07:16,936 --> 00:07:17,937
Sure.

87
00:07:46,632 --> 00:07:48,468
Why is he so warm?

88
00:07:50,803 --> 00:07:53,139
GET LOST

89
00:07:57,643 --> 00:08:00,646
The graffiti isn't the problem
with this car.

90
00:08:01,314 --> 00:08:02,315
What?

91
00:08:02,398 --> 00:08:04,525
It's way too old.

92
00:08:07,528 --> 00:08:11,282
You've been driving
such an old car all this time.

93
00:08:12,533 --> 00:08:15,912
Look here. The car is too aged.

94
00:08:15,995 --> 00:08:19,415
Gosh, sir. Sony could hear you.

95
00:08:19,499 --> 00:08:20,958
What? Who?

96
00:08:22,793 --> 00:08:23,878
My car.

97
00:08:27,590 --> 00:08:31,093
Even if I fix it now, it will keep
breaking down here and there.

98
00:08:31,177 --> 00:08:32,887
Do you still want to get it fixed?

99
00:08:36,724 --> 00:08:38,059
This is your first car, right?

100
00:08:38,893 --> 00:08:40,186
That's right.

101
00:08:41,521 --> 00:08:44,815
Most people hesitate a lot
when it's their first car.

102
00:08:44,899 --> 00:08:48,486
But cars have an expiry date too.

103
00:08:50,738 --> 00:08:54,659
Get a new car.
It'll make your heart race again.

104
00:09:04,001 --> 00:09:06,254
Both for love and objects,

105
00:09:06,337 --> 00:09:08,798
every relationship has an expiry date.

106
00:09:10,841 --> 00:09:13,594
But to say it has expired,

107
00:09:13,678 --> 00:09:17,223
the piled up times spent together
are too precious to let go.

108
00:09:18,015 --> 00:09:22,144
Still, nobody wouldn't welcome
a new racing sensation.

109
00:09:23,729 --> 00:09:24,897
It's complicated.

110
00:09:25,982 --> 00:09:29,110
Is this the end between Sony and me?

111
00:09:37,493 --> 00:09:38,911
Uncle.

112
00:09:38,995 --> 00:09:42,081
You're up. Have a seat.

113
00:09:48,754 --> 00:09:50,047
Here.

114
00:09:51,966 --> 00:09:53,134
Let's eat.

115
00:09:54,010 --> 00:09:57,013
Uncle. Why did you
come home late yesterday?

116
00:09:59,890 --> 00:10:02,226
Well, it's a long story.

117
00:10:02,310 --> 00:10:05,855
Something bad happened to Ha-na's car.

118
00:10:07,690 --> 00:10:09,275
You shouldn't ask stuff like that.

119
00:10:10,026 --> 00:10:11,777
Uncle has his privacy too.

120
00:10:14,572 --> 00:10:16,532
Let's eat. I'll scoop it for you.

121
00:10:17,241 --> 00:10:18,743
Don't give me a lot.

122
00:10:18,826 --> 00:10:20,411
What? Why suddenly?

123
00:10:20,494 --> 00:10:23,831
My stomach feels uncomfortable.
I can't poop.

124
00:10:24,415 --> 00:10:25,791
How disgusting.

125
00:10:27,460 --> 00:10:29,128
Hold on. Come here.

126
00:10:31,631 --> 00:10:33,341
Do you feel pain anywhere else?

127
00:10:33,424 --> 00:10:37,219
No. I'll be fine once I poop later.

128
00:10:41,390 --> 00:10:42,892
Good morning.

129
00:10:57,782 --> 00:11:01,327
Ms. Jeong. Set an official date
for the blind date right now.

130
00:11:01,410 --> 00:11:02,787
Right now?

131
00:11:03,454 --> 00:11:04,664
Tomorrow sounds good.

132
00:11:05,706 --> 00:11:07,166
It's a weekend too.

133
00:11:07,249 --> 00:11:09,251
No, never mind.

134
00:11:09,335 --> 00:11:11,754
He needs a day to prepare
physically and mentally.

135
00:11:11,837 --> 00:11:13,881
Tell him to meet me on Sunday.

136
00:11:15,007 --> 00:11:16,842
I need to check with Cheol-hui--

137
00:11:16,926 --> 00:11:18,844
I can decide on the location.

138
00:11:18,928 --> 00:11:20,429
Wait, no.

139
00:11:20,513 --> 00:11:22,598
Should I ask Cheol-hui first?

140
00:11:22,681 --> 00:11:26,435
No, Cheol-hui might feel pressured
if I ask him.

141
00:11:26,519 --> 00:11:27,770
I'll just decide myself.

142
00:11:27,853 --> 00:11:29,688
Anyway, I'll leave it to you.

143
00:11:30,272 --> 00:11:32,191
And for the blind date,

144
00:11:33,192 --> 00:11:36,362
I heard those on the team
would come and help.

145
00:11:36,445 --> 00:11:38,447
Gosh, I hate that.

146
00:11:38,531 --> 00:11:39,740
I'd feel so uncomfortable.

147
00:11:40,658 --> 00:11:45,579
I'm sorry to take away the chance
for them to earn the weekend allowance,

148
00:11:45,663 --> 00:11:48,165
but tell them to rest this weekend, okay?

149
00:11:48,249 --> 00:11:49,250
Bye.

150
00:11:53,879 --> 00:11:56,799
I'm in charge of her,
but I have nothing to take charge.

151
00:11:56,882 --> 00:11:57,925
Come here.

152
00:11:59,218 --> 00:12:02,763
Don't worry and go to work.

153
00:12:03,848 --> 00:12:05,266
You don't have a fever.

154
00:12:06,934 --> 00:12:08,936
I'll come back home early today.

155
00:12:09,019 --> 00:12:11,856
If you are still unwell,
let's go to the hospital.

156
00:12:11,939 --> 00:12:15,651
Uncle. San-i doesn't have a stomachache.

157
00:12:15,734 --> 00:12:17,987
He has a heartache.

158
00:12:18,070 --> 00:12:19,780
That's not true.

159
00:12:19,864 --> 00:12:22,992
It is. Aren't you unwell
because you have another crush?

160
00:12:23,075 --> 00:12:25,286
Did you fall for someone else?

161
00:12:25,369 --> 00:12:27,163
That's not true!

162
00:12:27,955 --> 00:12:31,917
Aren't you worried you won't be
able to confess like last time?

163
00:12:32,501 --> 00:12:34,086
I said no!

164
00:12:34,170 --> 00:12:36,672
- That's not true.
- It's true.

165
00:12:36,755 --> 00:12:38,883
- You can't confess.
- No.

166
00:12:38,966 --> 00:12:40,759
San-i, you'll have a fever. Don't run.

167
00:12:40,843 --> 00:12:42,219
- Hey, San-i.
- No!

168
00:12:48,976 --> 00:12:50,019
Why was she here?

169
00:12:50,102 --> 00:12:52,938
To set the date to meet Bong Cheol-hui.

170
00:12:53,022 --> 00:12:56,859
I see. She is assertive.

171
00:12:57,943 --> 00:13:00,946
Falling in love quickly
and cooling down quickly won't do well.

172
00:13:03,073 --> 00:13:05,075
- Welcome back, Mr. Choi.
- Hi.

173
00:13:05,159 --> 00:13:07,369
Why did the mayor want to see you?

174
00:13:07,453 --> 00:13:08,829
He increased our budget

175
00:13:10,080 --> 00:13:12,082
to celebrate the first successful couple.

176
00:13:12,166 --> 00:13:13,250
Did he?

177
00:13:14,418 --> 00:13:17,838
He is also looking forward to
Cheol-hui and In-a's official blind date.

178
00:13:17,922 --> 00:13:18,964
I see.

179
00:13:23,427 --> 00:13:25,679
Did the surveillance camera
capture anything?

180
00:13:25,763 --> 00:13:29,266
It was indeed that guy
who smashed the camera in the front.

181
00:13:29,350 --> 00:13:31,644
After that, he disappeared
into a blind spot,

182
00:13:31,727 --> 00:13:33,854
so no other camera caught him, but…

183
00:13:33,938 --> 00:13:35,356
But?

184
00:13:36,524 --> 00:13:40,277
We got one dash cam of a car
that was parked far away.

185
00:13:40,361 --> 00:13:41,904
Did it film the culprit?

186
00:13:41,987 --> 00:13:43,572
How does he look?

187
00:13:44,865 --> 00:13:47,618
It was too dark at night,
so they need to analyze it.

188
00:13:48,702 --> 00:13:50,913
How tall is he roughly?

189
00:13:50,996 --> 00:13:52,873
Between 175 to 180 cm?

190
00:13:52,957 --> 00:13:55,668
But that's the average height nowadays.

191
00:13:57,002 --> 00:14:00,464
Please patrol the area more securely
just in case.

192
00:14:00,548 --> 00:14:03,133
What else could happen?

193
00:14:04,218 --> 00:14:06,762
Anyway, I'll call you
when the analysis is done.

194
00:14:08,597 --> 00:14:09,682
You can go now.

195
00:14:14,478 --> 00:14:16,230
My goodness.

196
00:14:20,985 --> 00:14:22,486
Gosh, you scared me!

197
00:14:23,445 --> 00:14:26,866
Why are you looking at me like that?
It's scary.

198
00:14:26,949 --> 00:14:28,075
Mr. Detective.

199
00:14:28,993 --> 00:14:32,371
If you don't investigate properly,
I'll step in myself.

200
00:14:32,454 --> 00:14:33,789
Step in and do what?

201
00:14:33,873 --> 00:14:37,376
If you find anything,
make sure to call me.

202
00:14:37,459 --> 00:14:38,586
Do you understand?

203
00:14:39,795 --> 00:14:42,381
Well, okay.

204
00:14:46,552 --> 00:14:47,553
Goodness.

205
00:14:49,305 --> 00:14:50,389
What's with him?

206
00:14:51,724 --> 00:14:54,268
Welcome. My gosh.

207
00:14:54,351 --> 00:14:56,645
I'm pleasantly surprised to see you here.

208
00:14:58,022 --> 00:15:01,275
Is that how you say thank you?

209
00:15:01,358 --> 00:15:02,818
Fine, fine.

210
00:15:02,902 --> 00:15:06,113
Thanks to the beautiful and generous owner
who let us borrow her place,

211
00:15:06,196 --> 00:15:09,116
we got our first successful match.

212
00:15:09,199 --> 00:15:13,162
You must be pretty free. It's quite early.

213
00:15:13,245 --> 00:15:15,497
- I'm here for Cheol-hui.
- What?

214
00:15:15,581 --> 00:15:17,583
He said he'd be late today.

215
00:15:19,209 --> 00:15:20,461
I see.

216
00:15:21,503 --> 00:15:23,964
Jeong Ha-na, you're working really hard.

217
00:15:24,048 --> 00:15:27,551
Is there anyone
who would be a good fit for me?

218
00:15:28,719 --> 00:15:31,847
You were married once.
Do you really want to do it again?

219
00:15:31,931 --> 00:15:33,140
Of course.

220
00:15:33,223 --> 00:15:35,559
I was too young then.

221
00:15:35,643 --> 00:15:39,438
I thought love was everything.

222
00:15:41,315 --> 00:15:43,067
Is that not all then?

223
00:15:43,609 --> 00:15:45,653
In marriage,

224
00:15:45,736 --> 00:15:50,115
you need to maintain
the relationship forever

225
00:15:50,699 --> 00:15:52,993
even after love dies down.

226
00:15:54,870 --> 00:15:56,288
"Forever?"

227
00:15:58,499 --> 00:16:03,545
What is Oh In-a thinking
when she goes straight for Cheol-hui?

228
00:16:11,553 --> 00:16:13,097
Hello, Ha-na.

229
00:16:13,180 --> 00:16:16,850
I'm going to proceed
with you and In-a's official blind date.

230
00:16:16,934 --> 00:16:18,644
Are you free this weekend?

231
00:16:19,228 --> 00:16:21,188
Well, sure then.

232
00:16:21,271 --> 00:16:23,899
I'll tell you the time and location later.

233
00:16:24,483 --> 00:16:26,568
Are you not coming, Ha-na?

234
00:16:26,652 --> 00:16:29,530
I won't be coming.

235
00:16:29,613 --> 00:16:33,450
In-a made a special request
to be alone with you.

236
00:16:34,076 --> 00:16:35,869
Then what's your plan for the weekend?

237
00:16:36,704 --> 00:16:38,247
Me?

238
00:16:38,330 --> 00:16:42,042
Yes. I think I only talked about myself.

239
00:16:42,126 --> 00:16:44,420
I never asked what you were up to.

240
00:16:46,714 --> 00:16:49,758
Well, since it's a weekend,

241
00:16:51,176 --> 00:16:55,097
I'll go to singing class
and buy some stuff.

242
00:16:56,515 --> 00:16:58,642
The first peaceful weekend in a while.

243
00:16:59,727 --> 00:17:03,105
I'll end it with good news from you.

244
00:17:04,231 --> 00:17:07,317
You already have everything planned out.

245
00:17:07,985 --> 00:17:12,322
Focus on the blind date
so you can bring me good news.

246
00:17:12,406 --> 00:17:15,284
I get it. Don't worry.

247
00:17:15,367 --> 00:17:17,536
Have a good day.

248
00:17:32,509 --> 00:17:36,138
Yes. Sure.

249
00:17:36,221 --> 00:17:38,974
Thank you. Bye.

250
00:17:48,609 --> 00:17:49,610
HA-NA

251
00:17:49,693 --> 00:17:53,781
Wear something dandy
that goes well with a jazzy restaurant.

252
00:17:59,578 --> 00:18:01,163
Am I too early?

253
00:18:01,246 --> 00:18:02,456
Ha-na.

254
00:18:05,584 --> 00:18:07,294
You're not Ha-na.

255
00:18:09,963 --> 00:18:12,257
Guys, don't go ahead without me.

256
00:18:13,342 --> 00:18:15,260
Hi, Cheol-hui.

257
00:18:15,344 --> 00:18:17,012
Hi. You're early.

258
00:18:17,096 --> 00:18:20,390
Yes. I wanted to meet you quickly,
so I came early.

259
00:18:22,059 --> 00:18:23,936
They're my niece and nephew.

260
00:18:24,645 --> 00:18:27,731
Hello. They are so cute.

261
00:18:27,815 --> 00:18:29,274
Say hi.

262
00:18:29,358 --> 00:18:31,151
- Hello.
- Hello.

263
00:18:31,235 --> 00:18:33,612
Auntie Yeong-eun will come get you soon.

264
00:18:33,695 --> 00:18:35,989
So go back in. I'll be off.

265
00:18:36,073 --> 00:18:37,157
- Okay.
- Okay.

266
00:18:37,658 --> 00:18:39,159
Goodbye.

267
00:18:39,243 --> 00:18:41,286
Okay, bye. See you again.

268
00:18:43,497 --> 00:18:44,498
Let's go.

269
00:18:46,708 --> 00:18:47,793
Go back in.

270
00:18:56,760 --> 00:18:59,930
Go in now. See you later.

271
00:19:03,183 --> 00:19:07,396
Where is Ha-na, and who is she?

272
00:19:07,479 --> 00:19:09,648
Things will get messy like this.

273
00:19:23,871 --> 00:19:25,831
Finally, I get to rest.

274
00:19:29,168 --> 00:19:30,669
Come and get your car tomorrow.

275
00:19:35,674 --> 00:19:38,427
After a big accident, I quit my job.

276
00:19:38,510 --> 00:19:42,014
Since then, I moved to the island
and lived there until now.

277
00:19:42,598 --> 00:19:47,144
I got the scar on my back
from that accident too.

278
00:19:48,604 --> 00:19:51,064
I hope the blind date is going fine.

279
00:19:53,066 --> 00:19:55,027
He has a lot of emotional scars.

280
00:19:57,654 --> 00:19:59,531
Why does it have to be Oh In-a?

281
00:20:00,741 --> 00:20:02,910
No, get a grip, Jeong Ha-na.

282
00:20:03,493 --> 00:20:06,955
If Cheol-hui's blind date works out,
I can go back to my previous life.

283
00:20:07,706 --> 00:20:09,082
Yes, it's a good thing.

284
00:20:12,711 --> 00:20:15,631
I'll do my very best to have fun today.

285
00:20:32,272 --> 00:20:33,690
This is my first time.

286
00:20:34,816 --> 00:20:36,568
Huh? For what?

287
00:20:37,110 --> 00:20:42,532
Letting a man in this car
besides my secretary.

288
00:20:44,326 --> 00:20:47,621
But this car looks pretty new.

289
00:20:47,704 --> 00:20:49,456
Isn't this a new model?

290
00:20:49,539 --> 00:20:51,917
You could've pretended not to know.

291
00:20:53,710 --> 00:20:56,630
I'm going to become new
starting today too.

292
00:20:56,713 --> 00:20:59,132
What? What do you mean?

293
00:20:59,758 --> 00:21:02,803
Since you're being so honest with me,

294
00:21:02,886 --> 00:21:04,471
I should be honest with you too.

295
00:21:05,097 --> 00:21:08,433
Cheol-hui, do you really have a secret?

296
00:21:08,517 --> 00:21:12,187
Well, it's not exactly a secret.

297
00:21:12,271 --> 00:21:16,817
Actually, five years ago, my job was

298
00:21:18,360 --> 00:21:19,778
a firefighter.

299
00:21:20,946 --> 00:21:22,197
As in 911?

300
00:21:23,198 --> 00:21:24,199
Yes.

301
00:21:24,908 --> 00:21:29,913
I see. Your profile said your current job
was in fishing business.

302
00:21:29,997 --> 00:21:31,331
Why did you quit?

303
00:21:33,583 --> 00:21:34,793
Well--

304
00:21:34,876 --> 00:21:36,837
Because it didn't pay you well?

305
00:21:36,920 --> 00:21:38,755
I heard somewhere

306
00:21:38,839 --> 00:21:41,800
firefighters get paid little
compared to their dangerous work.

307
00:21:41,883 --> 00:21:43,760
Yes, well.

308
00:21:43,844 --> 00:21:46,388
They should pay you
a lot more for the danger, no?

309
00:21:46,471 --> 00:21:48,515
That's why they lost
someone as good as you.

310
00:21:48,598 --> 00:21:50,058
That's right, yes.

311
00:21:50,142 --> 00:21:53,478
So? Did you quit completely?

312
00:21:54,855 --> 00:21:57,441
Living as an island man
makes me feel happier now.

313
00:22:00,861 --> 00:22:02,988
Cheol-hui, you became really honest.

314
00:22:04,531 --> 00:22:05,866
I like you even more.

315
00:22:12,664 --> 00:22:15,917
Every moment

316
00:22:16,001 --> 00:22:18,795
That we'll walk together

317
00:22:18,879 --> 00:22:21,923
Open up your throat.

318
00:22:22,674 --> 00:22:25,135
Every

319
00:22:25,218 --> 00:22:29,097
Every moment

320
00:22:29,181 --> 00:22:32,100
That we'll walk together

321
00:22:32,184 --> 00:22:34,102
She's getting worse and worse.

322
00:22:34,186 --> 00:22:35,395
Am I dreaming?

323
00:22:55,123 --> 00:22:58,001
D BOOK'S, WUJEONG BOOKSTORE,
INFINITE SUSHI

324
00:23:39,793 --> 00:23:42,379
This restaurant has no customers.

325
00:23:42,462 --> 00:23:44,756
The restaurant might be gone tomorrow.

326
00:23:45,632 --> 00:23:46,633
Here?

327
00:23:47,676 --> 00:23:49,511
It's hard to reserve a table here.

328
00:23:49,594 --> 00:23:50,929
Really?

329
00:23:54,891 --> 00:23:57,435
Ha-na must've rented the whole restaurant.

330
00:23:58,562 --> 00:23:59,563
I did it.

331
00:24:00,605 --> 00:24:03,650
I wanted to spend a lovely time
with you alone.

332
00:24:07,112 --> 00:24:08,655
"Lovely…"

333
00:24:12,534 --> 00:24:13,827
Thanks.

334
00:24:15,453 --> 00:24:16,496
Thank you.

335
00:24:17,289 --> 00:24:18,790
In-a.

336
00:24:19,457 --> 00:24:20,625
Try some.

337
00:24:21,459 --> 00:24:22,961
Thank you.

338
00:24:23,044 --> 00:24:26,798
Cheol-hui,
what kind of person do you like?

339
00:24:29,759 --> 00:24:31,219
I like

340
00:24:32,387 --> 00:24:34,431
someone who makes me feel at ease.

341
00:24:34,514 --> 00:24:38,852
What? I've never heard that one before.

342
00:24:38,935 --> 00:24:42,772
You know, at first, people try their best
to make a good impression.

343
00:24:42,856 --> 00:24:44,441
Your heart races too.

344
00:24:45,901 --> 00:24:48,361
But even if my heart doesn't race as fast,

345
00:24:48,445 --> 00:24:54,326
I like a stable relationship where
we can think about the future together.

346
00:24:55,702 --> 00:24:59,206
Since marriage happens
only once in your life.

347
00:25:01,249 --> 00:25:05,337
I like someone who is fun to be with.

348
00:25:06,880 --> 00:25:11,551
You are fun to be with
because you make me curious.

349
00:25:12,761 --> 00:25:13,762
In-a.

350
00:25:15,305 --> 00:25:19,017
Do you know what the road
only fishermen like me can take is?

351
00:25:20,101 --> 00:25:22,938
The road only fishermen can take?

352
00:25:23,021 --> 00:25:25,273
Is this about your future?

353
00:25:26,650 --> 00:25:27,692
It's fisherman's…

354
00:25:30,028 --> 00:25:31,363
fishing rod.

355
00:25:34,407 --> 00:25:35,408
A fishing rod.

356
00:25:36,409 --> 00:25:37,744
How funny.

357
00:25:38,828 --> 00:25:40,580
MEDITERRANEAN SEA

358
00:25:47,379 --> 00:25:51,675
I'VE WANTED TO COME HERE
ONCE IN MY LIFE

359
00:26:11,319 --> 00:26:13,822
Did you sing 15 songs
at the music academy?

360
00:26:13,905 --> 00:26:17,492
No, I sang one song 15 times.

361
00:26:17,575 --> 00:26:20,328
I see. It was the same song.

362
00:26:30,964 --> 00:26:33,341
Who are you
and why do you keep following me?

363
00:26:33,425 --> 00:26:35,677
You vandalized my car too, didn't you?

364
00:26:35,760 --> 00:26:38,972
- Why do you follow me around? Who are you?
- I'm not that kind of person.

365
00:26:44,853 --> 00:26:47,355
She found me. Yes.

366
00:26:48,982 --> 00:26:50,150
Here.

367
00:26:53,445 --> 00:26:54,696
Ha-na.

368
00:26:55,280 --> 00:26:56,573
Cheol-hui?

369
00:26:57,574 --> 00:26:59,868
That's right, you're correct.

370
00:26:59,951 --> 00:27:03,455
This time, it's division.

371
00:27:03,538 --> 00:27:05,749
What is eight divided by four?

372
00:27:10,253 --> 00:27:13,923
- Imagine you have 80,000 won.
- Yes.

373
00:27:14,007 --> 00:27:17,218
You must invest in four different assets
using the money.

374
00:27:17,302 --> 00:27:20,221
How much can you invest in each asset?

375
00:27:20,305 --> 00:27:22,474
Must I invest in all four?

376
00:27:22,557 --> 00:27:23,683
That's not much money.

377
00:27:23,767 --> 00:27:27,145
Why don't I invest half each
in two assets?

378
00:27:27,228 --> 00:27:29,022
Goodness.

379
00:27:30,982 --> 00:27:33,360
I want half fried, half spicy chicken.

380
00:27:33,443 --> 00:27:34,652
Goodness.

381
00:27:35,362 --> 00:27:36,613
Welcome--

382
00:27:38,573 --> 00:27:39,741
- What?
- What?

383
00:27:44,913 --> 00:27:47,582
Yes. Don't worry about me
and enjoy your date.

384
00:27:47,665 --> 00:27:50,043
If he shows up, I'll just…

385
00:27:50,126 --> 00:27:53,671
This is why I got him to follow you.
I'm worried about you.

386
00:27:53,755 --> 00:27:55,215
Come on.

387
00:27:55,965 --> 00:27:58,343
Okay. I'll call you after the date.

388
00:27:58,426 --> 00:27:59,636
Okay.

389
00:28:06,976 --> 00:28:10,647
You should've told me honestly
from the start.

390
00:28:10,730 --> 00:28:13,149
He told me to make sure
you didn't find out.

391
00:28:13,733 --> 00:28:15,735
You were so obvious I couldn't ignore you.

392
00:28:17,862 --> 00:28:20,240
You'll be accompanying me today, right?

393
00:28:21,908 --> 00:28:23,410
Shall we go?

394
00:28:23,493 --> 00:28:24,494
Okay.

395
00:28:32,961 --> 00:28:34,421
I'm sorry.

396
00:28:36,798 --> 00:28:37,966
Was it Ha-na?

397
00:28:39,175 --> 00:28:40,677
What happened?

398
00:28:40,760 --> 00:28:42,178
It was nothing.

399
00:28:42,762 --> 00:28:45,223
I asked a friend to keep an eye on her

400
00:28:45,306 --> 00:28:47,350
without telling her,

401
00:28:47,434 --> 00:28:48,977
so she called to ask about that.

402
00:28:49,978 --> 00:28:51,730
Ha-na?

403
00:28:51,813 --> 00:28:53,106
Keep an eye on her?

404
00:28:53,189 --> 00:28:55,775
Not Ba-da and San-i?

405
00:28:55,859 --> 00:28:58,361
Ba-da and San-i take care
of themselves just fine.

406
00:28:58,445 --> 00:28:59,946
Ha-na is the problem.

407
00:29:03,199 --> 00:29:04,951
You two must've become very close.

408
00:29:05,034 --> 00:29:05,869
What?

409
00:29:05,952 --> 00:29:10,373
You kept checking your phone
for any messages.

410
00:29:11,916 --> 00:29:14,794
You acted as if you were waiting
for someone to contact you.

411
00:29:27,140 --> 00:29:29,309
You must've seen the sign outside.

412
00:29:29,392 --> 00:29:30,852
I was too hungry.

413
00:29:34,814 --> 00:29:38,401
There's an idiom.
Kill your enemy with kindness.

414
00:29:53,458 --> 00:29:56,085
Why are Cheol-hui's niece and nephew here?

415
00:29:56,169 --> 00:29:59,172
You must know
Cheol-hui has a blind date today.

416
00:29:59,255 --> 00:30:01,174
It's a weekend,
so their academy is closed.

417
00:30:01,257 --> 00:30:04,761
My friend who runs a kids café
is busy today, so the café is closed too.

418
00:30:05,553 --> 00:30:06,679
I see.

419
00:30:07,722 --> 00:30:10,266
If this will help Ha-na
get out of that place quickly,

420
00:30:10,350 --> 00:30:11,434
this is a piece of cake.

421
00:30:14,813 --> 00:30:16,731
Will Ha-na be coming here today?

422
00:30:18,066 --> 00:30:19,234
Yeong-eun.

423
00:30:19,901 --> 00:30:21,110
Speak of the devil.

424
00:30:26,032 --> 00:30:27,033
You're here.

425
00:30:27,742 --> 00:30:28,827
Hi.

426
00:30:31,663 --> 00:30:33,373
Who is he?

427
00:30:40,296 --> 00:30:41,840
You look happy.

428
00:30:41,923 --> 00:30:43,508
It's not what you think it is.

429
00:30:45,218 --> 00:30:46,511
Hello.

430
00:30:46,594 --> 00:30:49,848
Hello. I'm Ha-na's best friend

431
00:30:49,931 --> 00:30:51,933
and the owner of the restaurant.

432
00:30:52,016 --> 00:30:53,977
I heard this place had the best food.

433
00:30:54,060 --> 00:30:57,397
Gosh, Ha-na spoke the truth.

434
00:30:58,857 --> 00:31:01,651
But why is Mr. Choi here?

435
00:31:01,734 --> 00:31:04,112
I don't think it's over yet.

436
00:31:04,195 --> 00:31:05,572
What isn't?

437
00:31:11,578 --> 00:31:13,454
What's going on over there?

438
00:31:14,080 --> 00:31:16,040
She must be cheating too.

439
00:31:16,124 --> 00:31:19,377
- This will be total chaos.
- Yes.

440
00:31:23,798 --> 00:31:26,009
If you're done eating, pay for it.

441
00:31:27,468 --> 00:31:29,929
I haven't finished eating.

442
00:31:30,013 --> 00:31:31,514
I think you have.

443
00:31:33,349 --> 00:31:36,769
Kids, go outside and have fun
with this uncle here.

444
00:31:36,853 --> 00:31:39,856
- I'm not done eating.
- Yes, you are.

445
00:31:39,939 --> 00:31:42,734
Kids, go out and have fun.

446
00:31:42,817 --> 00:31:44,235
All of a sudden?

447
00:31:44,319 --> 00:31:46,321
- Wait.
- Goodness.

448
00:31:46,404 --> 00:31:48,364
Read the room and get out.

449
00:31:48,448 --> 00:31:50,491
- But…
- Go.

450
00:31:50,575 --> 00:31:51,993
Have fun, kids.

451
00:32:08,509 --> 00:32:10,178
What are you doing?

452
00:32:10,762 --> 00:32:14,098
Did your butt heal well?

453
00:32:16,976 --> 00:32:18,436
It must've hurt a lot.

454
00:32:18,519 --> 00:32:21,648
No. Thanks to you guys,
it's completely healed.

455
00:32:22,231 --> 00:32:25,443
But why is Ha-na seeing another guy?

456
00:32:25,526 --> 00:32:26,611
What?

457
00:32:27,987 --> 00:32:30,823
And why is my uncle seeing another woman?

458
00:32:30,907 --> 00:32:33,284
Did they have a fight?

459
00:32:35,370 --> 00:32:36,412
Well…

460
00:32:37,789 --> 00:32:40,166
In the world of adults,

461
00:32:40,249 --> 00:32:44,295
things happen now and then
that's hard to explain to kids.

462
00:32:47,048 --> 00:32:49,133
The world of kids is even worse.

463
00:32:50,385 --> 00:32:52,720
My class seatmate

464
00:32:52,804 --> 00:32:54,806
cheated on me and left yesterday.

465
00:32:56,099 --> 00:32:58,685
He had a hard time. He couldn't even poop.

466
00:33:00,019 --> 00:33:01,896
Why would you tell him that?

467
00:33:01,980 --> 00:33:03,690
I'm worried for you.

468
00:33:03,773 --> 00:33:05,024
That's enough.

469
00:33:05,108 --> 00:33:08,569
Anyway, it's not what you think,
so don't worry.

470
00:33:08,653 --> 00:33:10,113
Right?

471
00:33:10,196 --> 00:33:14,200
Ha-na is our uncle's partner,
so they wouldn't do that.

472
00:33:17,537 --> 00:33:18,621
"Partner?"

473
00:33:24,502 --> 00:33:27,714
Is this tanghulu that I saw on TV?

474
00:33:27,797 --> 00:33:32,760
Yes. This is tanghulu
that's all the rage nowadays.

475
00:33:32,844 --> 00:33:34,137
How is it?

476
00:33:34,220 --> 00:33:36,305
- It's the best.
- It's the best.

477
00:33:37,598 --> 00:33:41,519
Doesn't this remind you of the time
we went to Everland with dad?

478
00:33:41,602 --> 00:33:42,770
Yes.

479
00:33:42,854 --> 00:33:44,272
Dad?

480
00:33:44,355 --> 00:33:48,359
Yes. He went to Seoul
to earn lots of money.

481
00:33:48,443 --> 00:33:51,404
He said he'd come back to take us
when we were ten.

482
00:33:53,573 --> 00:33:55,366
How old are you guys now?

483
00:33:55,992 --> 00:33:57,702
We're ten now.

484
00:34:15,470 --> 00:34:20,808
How did you end up
taking care of your niece and nephew?

485
00:34:20,892 --> 00:34:22,477
It must not have been easy.

486
00:34:23,936 --> 00:34:24,937
It was easy.

487
00:34:25,980 --> 00:34:27,440
They're my niece and nephew.

488
00:34:29,567 --> 00:34:32,320
My parents passed away when I was little,

489
00:34:32,403 --> 00:34:33,946
so I grew up just with my brother.

490
00:34:35,198 --> 00:34:38,493
They are my older brother's kids,
so they're like my own.

491
00:34:40,411 --> 00:34:45,166
Still, the kids might become
a hindrance to your future.

492
00:34:45,249 --> 00:34:49,712
I'm living like a human being
thanks to the twins.

493
00:34:49,796 --> 00:34:53,132
Oh, no. I must've said
something rude, didn't I?

494
00:34:53,841 --> 00:34:55,343
That's not what I mean.

495
00:34:55,426 --> 00:34:59,680
I'm just saying
they give me the strength to live on.

496
00:35:04,644 --> 00:35:10,358
Cheol-hui, you are
kindhearted and positive.

497
00:35:12,193 --> 00:35:13,027
By the way,

498
00:35:14,195 --> 00:35:19,992
will the twins become
a burden to you, In-a?

499
00:35:35,550 --> 00:35:36,926
Move aside.

500
00:35:40,596 --> 00:35:43,933
Cheol-hui is very attentive.

501
00:35:44,016 --> 00:35:46,060
He even got his friend to follow you.

502
00:35:46,727 --> 00:35:47,770
Yes.

503
00:35:48,729 --> 00:35:49,939
He is attentive.

504
00:35:51,190 --> 00:35:52,525
Is he sending you a signal?

505
00:35:53,276 --> 00:35:54,277
Stop that.

506
00:35:55,611 --> 00:35:56,863
What's your name?

507
00:35:56,946 --> 00:35:58,990
I am Jeong Seong-chan.

508
00:35:59,073 --> 00:36:01,284
What a nice name. How old are you?

509
00:36:01,367 --> 00:36:02,243
I'm 25.

510
00:36:02,326 --> 00:36:05,079
That's perfect. Do you have a girlfriend?

511
00:36:05,163 --> 00:36:08,207
- No.
- You don't? It's perfect.

512
00:36:08,291 --> 00:36:09,792
- What's perfect?
- It's perfect.

513
00:36:09,876 --> 00:36:11,502
I'm helping you.

514
00:36:11,586 --> 00:36:15,590
Seong-chan, are you interested in
applying for the Marriage Boost Project?

515
00:36:15,673 --> 00:36:17,717
Not "Marriage Boost."
"Marriage Morale Boost."

516
00:36:17,800 --> 00:36:19,468
Interested in getting married?

517
00:36:19,552 --> 00:36:21,846
It's not that I don't want to,

518
00:36:21,929 --> 00:36:23,848
but I'm not sure if I want to.

519
00:36:23,931 --> 00:36:25,266
Why?

520
00:36:25,349 --> 00:36:27,310
I have trouble settling down.

521
00:36:27,393 --> 00:36:29,562
My relationships don't last long.

522
00:36:29,645 --> 00:36:33,566
When I get fired up quickly,
I cool down quickly too.

523
00:36:33,649 --> 00:36:35,193
Seong-chan, you're a bad guy.

524
00:36:35,276 --> 00:36:37,111
Your partner would get hurt.

525
00:36:37,195 --> 00:36:38,613
I take it back. Don't apply.

526
00:36:39,947 --> 00:36:40,948
By the way…

527
00:36:42,575 --> 00:36:44,869
Did you apply?

528
00:36:46,704 --> 00:36:48,456
I'm divorced, actually.

529
00:36:48,539 --> 00:36:49,665
I see.

530
00:36:49,749 --> 00:36:52,793
Since you were married once,
you wouldn't want to do it again.

531
00:36:52,877 --> 00:36:54,879
No, I want to get married again.

532
00:36:54,962 --> 00:36:57,548
I'm going to do it really well this time.

533
00:36:59,133 --> 00:37:02,053
If I apply, can I meet a woman like you?

534
00:37:03,137 --> 00:37:05,389
If you say that, I'll misunderstand.

535
00:37:05,473 --> 00:37:08,976
Why, do you think
you can meet someone like me?

536
00:37:09,060 --> 00:37:09,894
Yes.

537
00:37:09,977 --> 00:37:12,939
If you stare at me with your doe eyes,
you'll make my heart race.

538
00:37:13,022 --> 00:37:17,360
You can feel fluttered
over a short, fleeting moment.

539
00:37:18,986 --> 00:37:23,199
But how long the fluttering feeling lasts

540
00:37:23,824 --> 00:37:25,493
depends on the individual.

541
00:37:27,203 --> 00:37:29,538
When the fluttering feeling disappears,

542
00:37:30,331 --> 00:37:34,418
what kind of emotions must you have
to maintain the relationship?

543
00:37:39,048 --> 00:37:42,260
TEAM LEADER CHOI GI-JUN

544
00:37:45,554 --> 00:37:47,640
Is the date still ongoing?

545
00:37:53,104 --> 00:37:55,106
Are you ready for the next course?

546
00:37:55,898 --> 00:37:58,025
There's a next course prepared?

547
00:38:00,528 --> 00:38:03,656
Next time, send me
the schedule beforehand.

548
00:38:04,949 --> 00:38:07,118
There's a bar in my neighbor that I like.

549
00:38:07,201 --> 00:38:08,494
Let's go there.

550
00:38:11,330 --> 00:38:13,582
Well, today--

551
00:38:13,666 --> 00:38:18,004
I'm really tired
from driving all day today.

552
00:38:19,839 --> 00:38:22,383
You'll come with me, right?

553
00:38:22,967 --> 00:38:26,262
Yes, let's go. We can go.

554
00:38:33,978 --> 00:38:34,979
Hey.

555
00:38:42,361 --> 00:38:43,863
You're alone.

556
00:38:43,946 --> 00:38:45,364
Where are the twins?

557
00:38:45,948 --> 00:38:48,284
I played with them all day
and sent them home now.

558
00:38:48,367 --> 00:38:50,286
I see. That's good.

559
00:38:51,203 --> 00:38:53,456
But I think Cheol-hui will be late today.

560
00:38:53,539 --> 00:38:55,624
You know the bar in front of In-a's house?

561
00:38:55,708 --> 00:38:58,711
She doesn't take anyone there,
but she took him there.

562
00:39:00,671 --> 00:39:03,674
I think In-a is really serious.
It's for the better.

563
00:39:05,092 --> 00:39:07,595
They're drinking at this hour?

564
00:39:09,221 --> 00:39:10,222
By the way,

565
00:39:11,474 --> 00:39:13,934
who was that friend just now?

566
00:39:15,269 --> 00:39:16,270
He--

567
00:39:18,356 --> 00:39:19,231
Let me answer this.

568
00:39:20,649 --> 00:39:22,651
Yes, I'm on my way home.

569
00:39:24,320 --> 00:39:25,905
Gosh.

570
00:39:25,988 --> 00:39:27,573
What a nice weather today.

571
00:39:30,868 --> 00:39:34,246
Yes. Make sure to lock the door.
It's unsettling nowadays.

572
00:39:34,872 --> 00:39:36,165
Okay, bye.

573
00:39:47,301 --> 00:39:49,512
What if In-a comes on to him?

574
00:39:54,892 --> 00:39:56,227
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

575
00:40:19,333 --> 00:40:21,502
I feel so much better.

576
00:40:23,129 --> 00:40:24,839
Drink slowly.

577
00:40:28,342 --> 00:40:29,844
I must've been too tense.

578
00:40:32,096 --> 00:40:33,097
What?

579
00:40:33,180 --> 00:40:35,599
What did you say?

580
00:40:37,518 --> 00:40:39,895
I must've been too tense.

581
00:40:40,688 --> 00:40:42,815
Really? Excuse…

582
00:40:45,985 --> 00:40:49,113
Wait here. I'll bring some water.

583
00:41:03,794 --> 00:41:05,546
See that?

584
00:41:06,714 --> 00:41:08,883
Cheol-hui is kind to me too.

585
00:41:15,431 --> 00:41:17,558
I'll just check and leave.

586
00:41:17,641 --> 00:41:21,562
Just for risk management's sake,
since I'm in charge of Cheol-hui.

587
00:41:32,364 --> 00:41:33,532
Well…

588
00:41:34,492 --> 00:41:38,245
You know, when I'm with you,

589
00:41:38,329 --> 00:41:41,790
my heart flutters, and I really like that.

590
00:41:42,791 --> 00:41:44,168
I see.

591
00:41:47,213 --> 00:41:51,300
I think, "This is what
fluttering feels like."

592
00:41:52,218 --> 00:41:53,552
My goodness.

593
00:41:54,762 --> 00:41:56,639
Goodness.

594
00:42:25,834 --> 00:42:27,461
What are they doing there?

595
00:42:35,052 --> 00:42:36,178
What?

596
00:42:39,181 --> 00:42:41,016
What are you doing here?

597
00:42:41,934 --> 00:42:44,853
Why did you follow me?

598
00:42:44,937 --> 00:42:47,356
I promised Cheol-hui

599
00:42:47,439 --> 00:42:48,941
to send you home safely.

600
00:42:50,109 --> 00:42:52,319
What were you doing here?

601
00:42:52,403 --> 00:42:55,155
Well,

602
00:42:55,239 --> 00:42:56,949
since I'm in charge of Cheol-hui,

603
00:42:57,032 --> 00:43:00,411
I came to check
if his date was going well.

604
00:43:00,494 --> 00:43:03,372
Do you even know what time it is?

605
00:43:03,455 --> 00:43:05,416
Don't civil servants get off work too?

606
00:43:05,499 --> 00:43:07,334
I was going to go home.

607
00:43:07,418 --> 00:43:09,628
I did step my right foot in it.

608
00:43:20,639 --> 00:43:21,724
Get in.

609
00:43:23,267 --> 00:43:25,394
- Sir, to Injeong-dong, please.
- Okay.

610
00:43:37,448 --> 00:43:39,116
Why did I go there?

611
00:43:42,995 --> 00:43:44,872
Are they still together?

612
00:43:51,503 --> 00:43:53,380
What am I thinking about?

613
00:43:56,008 --> 00:43:58,552
INJEONG CITY HALL

614
00:44:03,223 --> 00:44:04,892
Yes, come in.

615
00:44:07,269 --> 00:44:08,771
Hi, Mr. Choi.

616
00:44:12,608 --> 00:44:13,859
I heard you called.

617
00:44:15,861 --> 00:44:17,446
Mr. Choi.

618
00:44:19,239 --> 00:44:20,407
Did you see this?

619
00:44:25,245 --> 00:44:28,374
3RD GENERATION CONGLOMERATE
AND THE ISLAND MAN

620
00:44:29,124 --> 00:44:32,461
I didn't take you for it.

621
00:44:34,797 --> 00:44:36,465
Mr. Choi,

622
00:44:37,633 --> 00:44:39,760
you work very nicely.

623
00:44:40,636 --> 00:44:41,679
Pardon?

624
00:44:41,762 --> 00:44:45,516
Thanks to that post,
we got 103 more followers.

625
00:44:48,644 --> 00:44:51,063
You should strike while the iron is hot.

626
00:44:51,146 --> 00:44:52,147
Don't you agree?

627
00:44:52,231 --> 00:44:54,525
Yes. We'll focus more on promoting.

628
00:44:54,608 --> 00:44:55,692
Do that.

629
00:45:01,031 --> 00:45:03,575
I'm here to submit an application.

630
00:45:03,659 --> 00:45:05,536
I see.

631
00:45:05,619 --> 00:45:08,914
Welcome.

632
00:45:09,873 --> 00:45:13,210
I'm Lee Ji-gyeong,
in charge of offline applications.

633
00:45:13,293 --> 00:45:14,545
Hello.

634
00:45:14,628 --> 00:45:17,714
You took such a nice photo.

635
00:45:17,798 --> 00:45:22,052
Let's talk about it in detail inside,
shall we?

636
00:45:22,136 --> 00:45:24,138
- Okay.
- It's that way.

637
00:45:24,221 --> 00:45:26,432
- Mr. Han, join me.
- Okay.

638
00:45:27,641 --> 00:45:30,602
My goodness, he's so fine.

639
00:45:31,937 --> 00:45:33,272
Why is he here?

640
00:45:34,064 --> 00:45:36,024
Isn't it too early for him to get married?

641
00:45:36,817 --> 00:45:40,946
If I apply here, how many times
can I go on blind dates?

642
00:45:42,948 --> 00:45:45,742
If I break up with one applicant,

643
00:45:45,826 --> 00:45:48,495
can't I date another applicant?

644
00:45:49,621 --> 00:45:50,789
Seong-chan.

645
00:45:50,873 --> 00:45:56,170
People who are determined to get married
apply for our project.

646
00:45:56,253 --> 00:45:58,547
For marriage.

647
00:45:58,630 --> 00:46:03,469
You need to be prepared to be with
only one person for the rest of your life.

648
00:46:03,552 --> 00:46:09,266
Are you actually mentally prepared for it?

649
00:46:09,850 --> 00:46:12,019
Couldn't it be because I haven't found

650
00:46:12,102 --> 00:46:15,105
someone who attracts me enough
to settle down with?

651
00:46:16,982 --> 00:46:19,193
Attraction. It's important.

652
00:46:19,776 --> 00:46:22,529
Honestly, now that I'm married,

653
00:46:22,613 --> 00:46:25,491
moments of crisis arrive.

654
00:46:27,075 --> 00:46:30,329
I miss the heart-fluttering days
when we used to date.

655
00:46:30,412 --> 00:46:33,123
We don't love each other
as passionately as before.

656
00:46:33,207 --> 00:46:37,127
"Can I maintain this marriage well?"

657
00:46:37,211 --> 00:46:38,462
I start to worry too.

658
00:46:38,545 --> 00:46:41,548
Isn't that because of your partner?

659
00:46:41,632 --> 00:46:43,967
They say everyone changes
once they get married.

660
00:46:45,761 --> 00:46:48,514
The moment you start blaming someone else,

661
00:46:48,597 --> 00:46:50,349
your misery starts.

662
00:46:52,267 --> 00:46:55,395
It's so different from dating.

663
00:46:55,479 --> 00:46:56,480
It's hard.

664
00:46:56,563 --> 00:47:00,734
People say they maintain the marriage
out of loyalty.

665
00:47:00,817 --> 00:47:02,486
Now that I'm married,

666
00:47:02,569 --> 00:47:05,197
I realized love wasn't just about

667
00:47:05,280 --> 00:47:07,950
those stimulations
that make your heart race.

668
00:47:08,033 --> 00:47:11,578
It won't turn into a soap opera
only when you realize this.

669
00:47:11,662 --> 00:47:15,040
Are you saying loyalty is
more important than love?

670
00:47:15,123 --> 00:47:18,502
You can't just sum it up as loyalty.

671
00:47:18,585 --> 00:47:20,879
There's something else too.

672
00:47:22,172 --> 00:47:25,259
Something that connects you two firmly.

673
00:47:25,342 --> 00:47:29,263
It's comfortable, reliable, and stable.

674
00:47:29,346 --> 00:47:31,640
Loyalty and love.

675
00:47:31,723 --> 00:47:36,186
Somewhere in between the two,
I should say.

676
00:47:37,312 --> 00:47:41,483
Anyway, Seong-chan,
are you mentally prepared to get married

677
00:47:41,567 --> 00:47:46,947
and only stick to one person
for the rest of your life?

678
00:47:47,030 --> 00:47:49,366
Do give it some thought.

679
00:47:57,416 --> 00:47:59,418
You didn't have to bring this.

680
00:47:59,501 --> 00:48:02,254
I packed some
since I'm taking away your lunchtime.

681
00:48:04,506 --> 00:48:05,507
Thank you.

682
00:48:07,301 --> 00:48:09,052
Seong-chan came by.

683
00:48:09,136 --> 00:48:10,053
Chan did?

684
00:48:11,263 --> 00:48:12,723
That's unexpected.

685
00:48:12,806 --> 00:48:17,769
I've never seen him date a girl
for longer than six months.

686
00:48:19,062 --> 00:48:22,524
I think he came to apply to
find out if he was suitable for marriage.

687
00:48:22,608 --> 00:48:24,776
They confirmed he wasn't,
and he went back.

688
00:48:26,945 --> 00:48:29,656
Injeong City Hall has
a solid checking system.

689
00:48:31,325 --> 00:48:34,995
Chan doesn't know the levels of love.

690
00:48:36,204 --> 00:48:38,915
Cheol-hui who knows the levels of love,
how was yesterday?

691
00:48:40,292 --> 00:48:42,461
Your photo was on Instagram too.

692
00:48:42,544 --> 00:48:45,005
Didn't you prepare it for my sake?

693
00:48:45,797 --> 00:48:48,842
I did my best for you.

694
00:48:48,925 --> 00:48:51,678
It was the first date,
so I shouldn't reject everything.

695
00:48:53,764 --> 00:48:55,515
That's true.

696
00:48:57,976 --> 00:48:59,561
When did you go home yesterday?

697
00:49:00,145 --> 00:49:01,146
Yesterday?

698
00:49:01,772 --> 00:49:04,399
Yesterday. Hold on. Yesterday…

699
00:49:05,192 --> 00:49:07,986
It wasn't yesterday. I went home today.

700
00:49:08,070 --> 00:49:11,406
What? You stayed out on the first date?

701
00:49:11,490 --> 00:49:13,825
Isn't it today if it's past midnight?

702
00:49:17,913 --> 00:49:19,623
Eat this and this.

703
00:49:20,499 --> 00:49:23,043
I'm going to meet In-a later.

704
00:49:24,503 --> 00:49:25,796
Again today?

705
00:49:25,879 --> 00:49:27,339
She got so drunk yesterday.

706
00:49:27,422 --> 00:49:29,091
I had a hard time sending her home.

707
00:49:29,174 --> 00:49:30,926
She wanted to make it up to me.

708
00:49:31,009 --> 00:49:32,427
So I let her.

709
00:49:34,054 --> 00:49:35,931
Why does she want to do it immediately?

710
00:49:36,014 --> 00:49:38,016
She doesn't know how to play hard to get.

711
00:49:38,684 --> 00:49:41,645
Why? Is there a problem?

712
00:49:42,813 --> 00:49:44,147
No.

713
00:49:46,149 --> 00:49:49,486
If there isn't, try this.

714
00:49:51,947 --> 00:49:53,031
It's delicious.

715
00:49:55,575 --> 00:49:57,744
OH IN-A OF DYAN GROUP
DATING THE ISLAND MAN?

716
00:49:57,828 --> 00:50:00,038
They'll be meeting today too?

717
00:50:05,669 --> 00:50:08,213
Hello. I hope you're doing well.

718
00:50:08,296 --> 00:50:10,716
Is this Ms. Oh In-a's secretary's office?

719
00:50:11,883 --> 00:50:13,802
SURVEILLANCE CAMERA RECORDING

720
00:50:23,520 --> 00:50:25,397
There's nobody to visit me at this hour.

721
00:50:33,280 --> 00:50:34,322
Who are you?

722
00:50:34,406 --> 00:50:37,868
I'm Assistant Inspector Park Seon-wu
of Injeong Police Station.

723
00:50:37,951 --> 00:50:40,203
You remember me, right?

724
00:50:40,746 --> 00:50:44,833
Oh, yes. What is it about?

725
00:50:45,417 --> 00:50:47,669
I checked the dash cams of nearby cars.

726
00:50:47,753 --> 00:50:50,213
A suspicious-looking man
with a similar build

727
00:50:50,297 --> 00:50:52,466
was spotted often
around the victim's house.

728
00:50:52,549 --> 00:50:55,802
Really? Who is it? Did you identify him?

729
00:50:55,886 --> 00:50:58,930
He was wearing a mask, so it's unclear.

730
00:50:59,014 --> 00:51:00,265
It's him.

731
00:51:03,602 --> 00:51:07,397
Does the victim owe anyone money

732
00:51:07,481 --> 00:51:10,609
or break up with her previous boyfriend
on bad terms?

733
00:51:10,692 --> 00:51:13,111
In that case,
we'll have to investigate differently

734
00:51:13,195 --> 00:51:15,113
and start from scratch.

735
00:51:19,701 --> 00:51:21,119
I understand.

736
00:51:24,831 --> 00:51:25,999
Thank you.

737
00:51:26,792 --> 00:51:28,084
Hey, wait.

738
00:51:32,964 --> 00:51:34,382
After the paparazzi's photo,

739
00:51:34,466 --> 00:51:37,719
there's a constant increase in
news articles and shares on social media.

740
00:51:40,722 --> 00:51:43,892
Can you find the first person
who uploaded the photo?

741
00:51:43,975 --> 00:51:45,477
Shall I take legal actions?

742
00:51:46,561 --> 00:51:47,646
No.

743
00:51:48,647 --> 00:51:51,817
Find them and get the original copy.

744
00:51:51,900 --> 00:51:53,777
Even better if we look very close.

745
00:51:55,487 --> 00:51:56,530
I will.

746
00:52:01,451 --> 00:52:02,953
I'm sorry, In-a.

747
00:52:03,620 --> 00:52:07,040
There's an emergency,
so I can't meet you today.

748
00:52:07,123 --> 00:52:08,166
See you next time.

749
00:52:08,250 --> 00:52:09,376
CHEOL-HUI

750
00:52:10,085 --> 00:52:13,713
You can go home now.

751
00:52:15,048 --> 00:52:16,299
Right now?

752
00:52:17,384 --> 00:52:19,010
My evening plan got canceled.

753
00:52:29,312 --> 00:52:33,316
Hard times that we've endured

754
00:52:33,400 --> 00:52:36,611
Hope it will shine on us brightly one day

755
00:52:36,695 --> 00:52:37,821
I'm beat.

756
00:52:40,031 --> 00:52:41,199
I did my best.

757
00:52:45,871 --> 00:52:47,581
Who is it?

758
00:52:50,709 --> 00:52:51,918
You have a delivery.

759
00:52:53,295 --> 00:52:55,839
But I didn't order anything.

760
00:53:32,792 --> 00:53:36,421
CHEOL-HUI AND DA-BIN,
OUR LOVE FOREVER, GET LOST

761
00:53:39,215 --> 00:53:41,676
The person is unable to answer the call.

762
00:53:41,760 --> 00:53:43,428
What is she doing?

763
00:54:00,445 --> 00:54:01,488
Excuse me.

764
00:54:09,579 --> 00:54:10,580
Hey!

765
00:54:31,810 --> 00:54:32,811
Stop!

766
00:54:50,412 --> 00:54:53,039
Who are you?

767
00:55:02,382 --> 00:55:05,343
You… Aren't you Jin-hyeong?

768
00:55:11,266 --> 00:55:12,350
Why are you…

769
00:55:26,114 --> 00:55:27,407
Why did you do that?

770
00:55:29,492 --> 00:55:31,244
You damaged the car too?

771
00:55:33,580 --> 00:55:35,040
Do you know him?

772
00:55:39,461 --> 00:55:41,921
He is my ex-girlfriend's younger brother.

773
00:55:42,672 --> 00:55:44,049
It's not that simple.

774
00:55:46,259 --> 00:55:48,595
We would've become family
if you had married her.

775
00:55:51,431 --> 00:55:53,183
If she didn't die in the accident…

776
00:55:58,563 --> 00:56:00,315
I was so angry.

777
00:56:02,901 --> 00:56:05,737
The sight of you
finding a marriage partner pained me.

778
00:56:10,450 --> 00:56:12,869
But why did you target me?

779
00:56:13,495 --> 00:56:15,455
What do I have to do with this?

780
00:56:16,039 --> 00:56:18,166
You persuaded him.

781
00:56:18,249 --> 00:56:21,795
He was doing fine alone,
but you lured him out of the island.

782
00:56:27,258 --> 00:56:28,259
It's sickening.

783
00:56:30,595 --> 00:56:32,806
How could you forget her so easily?

784
00:56:39,395 --> 00:56:41,564
You said you wouldn't accept anyone else.

785
00:56:43,650 --> 00:56:46,486
So why would you
look for a marriage partner?

786
00:56:55,578 --> 00:56:57,330
I never forgot her.

787
00:57:00,291 --> 00:57:02,335
Because I blamed myself every day.

788
00:57:04,546 --> 00:57:07,173
I wanted to forget
because it was painful, but I couldn't.

789
00:57:10,635 --> 00:57:12,804
If I had kept my promise that day…

790
00:57:15,932 --> 00:57:18,059
I could've prevented the accident.

791
00:57:20,979 --> 00:57:22,939
I can't erase that thought.

792
00:57:32,323 --> 00:57:34,826
Then you can continue to live that way.

793
00:57:40,165 --> 00:57:42,625
You must remember my sister forever.

794
00:57:59,601 --> 00:58:03,229
How can you remember a sad past
for centuries and millenniums?

795
00:58:06,441 --> 00:58:08,860
There must be an expiry date
for the pain too.

796
00:58:12,947 --> 00:58:15,116
The longer it gets,
the deeper the wound gets.

797
00:58:16,034 --> 00:58:19,370
Living miserably for the rest of the life
isn't courtesy to the past love.

798
00:58:22,540 --> 00:58:24,125
Your sister…

799
00:58:26,169 --> 00:58:28,046
wouldn't want that either.

800
00:58:55,865 --> 00:58:57,992
It came off clean.

801
00:58:58,076 --> 00:58:59,869
I didn't just remove the paint.

802
00:59:00,453 --> 00:59:03,498
I repaired all the parts
that seemed unstable.

803
00:59:03,581 --> 00:59:05,291
It should be fine for the time being.

804
00:59:05,875 --> 00:59:08,711
But if something does break down,
come to me right away.

805
00:59:09,212 --> 00:59:11,548
Its expiry date has been pushed back.

806
00:59:11,631 --> 00:59:14,050
Thank you. I'll ride it carefully.

807
00:59:14,133 --> 00:59:15,134
Goodness.

808
00:59:21,849 --> 00:59:24,769
Remembering that a wound was there…

809
00:59:28,189 --> 00:59:32,193
means you shared the pain of that moment.

810
00:59:34,237 --> 00:59:37,073
When moments like that pile up
one after another,

811
00:59:38,866 --> 00:59:41,119
it builds a relationship deeper

812
00:59:41,202 --> 00:59:43,830
than what something new can give you.

813
00:59:53,131 --> 00:59:57,051
Everything definitely has an expiry date.

814
00:59:58,011 --> 01:00:02,390
But only I can decide the expiry date.

815
01:00:11,482 --> 01:00:16,821
I decided to spend more time
with my car, Sony.

816
01:00:28,958 --> 01:00:30,960
Did you send him off well?

817
01:00:32,545 --> 01:00:35,423
Yes, thanks to you.

818
01:00:38,801 --> 01:00:41,387
It took you five years to say goodbye.

819
01:00:42,263 --> 01:00:45,141
Thank you, Ha-na.

820
01:00:49,062 --> 01:00:51,272
Shall we start anew?

821
01:00:52,523 --> 01:00:54,609
Okay, let's do that.

822
01:00:57,695 --> 01:01:01,282
Why is this…
Is it supposed to be like this?

823
01:01:01,366 --> 01:01:03,284
- What's wrong? Is it not working?
- This…

824
01:01:03,368 --> 01:01:06,496
- Try again.
- If I do this…

825
01:01:06,579 --> 01:01:07,789
Like this.

826
01:01:26,808 --> 01:01:29,143
- Wear it properly. Let's go.
- Okay.

827
01:01:31,771 --> 01:01:35,149
Why is this… Is this for kids?

828
01:01:36,025 --> 01:01:37,568
Do I just put my arm in?

829
01:01:38,986 --> 01:01:42,031
Aren't they Ba-da and San-i?

830
01:01:52,709 --> 01:01:55,002
Darn it. Wait here.

831
01:02:22,947 --> 01:02:25,283
Cheol-hui, what kind of marriage
do you dream of?

832
01:02:25,366 --> 01:02:29,245
Someone who finds my downsides cute too.

833
01:02:29,328 --> 01:02:31,998
It's my dream to get married
to someone like that.

834
01:02:32,081 --> 01:02:34,417
It's my dream to marry a husband
who waits for me

835
01:02:34,500 --> 01:02:35,877
to come home and cooks for me.

836
01:02:35,960 --> 01:02:40,339
Marriage cannot be accomplished
with just one person's fantasy.

837
01:02:40,423 --> 01:02:42,383
Because marriage is reality.

838
01:02:42,467 --> 01:02:46,053
I must be rich like her
to do everything I want.

839
01:02:46,137 --> 01:02:47,972
Marriage is reality.

840
01:02:48,055 --> 01:02:49,807
Everything's ready on my part.

841
01:02:49,891 --> 01:02:51,267
You know my conditions.

842
01:02:51,350 --> 01:02:52,894
What brings you here?

843
01:02:52,977 --> 01:02:54,228
I'm off.

844
01:02:54,312 --> 01:02:56,230
Don't tell me…

845
01:02:56,314 --> 01:02:59,066
Jeong Ha-na, stop pretending
like you're living in a bubble.

846
01:02:59,150 --> 01:03:01,486
Gi-jun and your relationship fell apart

847
01:03:01,569 --> 01:03:03,196
because of realistic issues.

848
01:03:03,279 --> 01:03:06,699
I know all sorts of things
can become issues when we get married.

849
01:03:06,783 --> 01:03:09,202
But I'll make sure none of them
are money-related.

850
01:03:09,285 --> 01:03:10,453
This is…

851
01:03:10,536 --> 01:03:13,664
You guys must disappear
for your uncle to live happily.

852
01:03:13,748 --> 01:03:16,918
We'll start dating for real
after we drink this.

853
01:03:18,461 --> 01:03:23,466
