1
00:00:36,578 --> 00:00:37,912
ALL CHARACTERS, ORGANIZATIONS,
AND PLACES ARE FICTITIOUS

2
00:00:37,996 --> 00:00:39,289
FILMING OF CHILD ACTORS DONE
UNDER BROADCASTING GUIDELINES

3
00:00:42,459 --> 00:00:45,253
Cheol-hui, have you made a life plan?

4
00:00:46,296 --> 00:00:47,922
A life plan?

5
00:00:48,840 --> 00:00:51,885
Do you mean how I'm going
to make a living and such things?

6
00:00:51,968 --> 00:00:52,927
Yes.

7
00:00:55,972 --> 00:00:58,183
Before I met you,

8
00:00:58,266 --> 00:01:00,977
I thought raising the twins well

9
00:01:01,061 --> 00:01:02,812
was my entire life.

10
00:01:03,980 --> 00:01:05,315
What about now?

11
00:01:06,858 --> 00:01:08,234
Well, now…

12
00:01:09,986 --> 00:01:12,781
Now that you're in my life,

13
00:01:12,864 --> 00:01:14,741
I want to plan it with you.

14
00:01:18,161 --> 00:01:19,162
Right.

15
00:01:20,163 --> 00:01:23,249
Now I have to think
about our future together

16
00:01:23,333 --> 00:01:26,961
and not just my own life.

17
00:01:27,587 --> 00:01:29,506
I'd forgotten

18
00:01:29,589 --> 00:01:32,300
that this is what marriage is about.

19
00:01:33,843 --> 00:01:35,637
What about you, Ha-na?

20
00:01:38,097 --> 00:01:40,475
Do you have any other plans?

21
00:01:41,601 --> 00:01:46,439
It's a relationship that requires
more than having feelings for each other.

22
00:01:47,607 --> 00:01:52,570
It requires the determination
to be responsible for each other forever.

23
00:01:52,654 --> 00:01:54,489
Let's just take our time.

24
00:01:55,657 --> 00:01:58,201
I've already made up my mind anyway.

25
00:02:03,873 --> 00:02:08,753
I think I'm qualified to get married now.

26
00:02:11,714 --> 00:02:13,007
Thanks to you,

27
00:02:14,300 --> 00:02:16,469
I figured out
what those qualifications are.

28
00:02:19,597 --> 00:02:23,351
Am I qualified to get married?

29
00:02:44,289 --> 00:02:46,332
I don't think this will work.

30
00:03:03,141 --> 00:03:03,975
Ha-na.

31
00:03:06,477 --> 00:03:08,313
Look at me.

32
00:03:12,275 --> 00:03:13,568
I don't want you…

33
00:03:15,695 --> 00:03:18,239
to feel pressured because of me.

34
00:03:28,416 --> 00:03:30,752
I think it's best if we stop here.

35
00:03:34,255 --> 00:03:36,466
Cheol-hui, I don't think…

36
00:03:39,928 --> 00:03:43,431
I'm ready to accept anyone
into my life in the way you expect.

37
00:03:45,683 --> 00:03:48,019
I'll end up hurting you.

38
00:03:58,696 --> 00:04:02,283
I don't know when it started.

39
00:04:05,662 --> 00:04:08,164
But whenever you look at me
with a big smile…

40
00:04:10,792 --> 00:04:13,169
I feel the happiest I've ever felt.

41
00:04:17,340 --> 00:04:18,675
Ha-na.

42
00:04:20,635 --> 00:04:24,264
I'm not sure what I mean to you.

43
00:04:28,268 --> 00:04:29,811
But I know that…

44
00:04:32,146 --> 00:04:34,023
I became a better person because of you.

45
00:04:37,819 --> 00:04:38,987
So there's no need…

46
00:04:41,698 --> 00:04:43,950
to feel guilty about this.

47
00:04:46,160 --> 00:04:48,079
Don't worry about me.

48
00:04:52,083 --> 00:04:53,584
I'm not going anywhere.

49
00:04:58,089 --> 00:04:59,215
All I want is…

50
00:05:02,176 --> 00:05:04,429
for you to have no regrets.

51
00:05:36,586 --> 00:05:38,254
MOM'S KIMCHI,
PONYTAIL RADISH KIMCHI

52
00:05:38,337 --> 00:05:40,006
MOM'S BEAN SPROUTS, SPINACH

53
00:05:40,089 --> 00:05:41,758
STIR-FRIED MUSHROOMS,
DRIED SQUID

54
00:05:55,480 --> 00:05:57,273
TO MY SWEET DAUGHTER
LOVE, MOM

55
00:06:10,912 --> 00:06:13,623
Ha-na, did I ever tell you?

56
00:06:16,250 --> 00:06:20,630
I fought a lot with your dad
while we were married.

57
00:06:21,380 --> 00:06:24,092
But if something came along
that I couldn't handle alone,

58
00:06:24,967 --> 00:06:28,262
your dad was by my side
to help me get through it.

59
00:06:32,517 --> 00:06:35,019
One day, when I'm no longer here,

60
00:06:36,145 --> 00:06:38,356
I wonder who will be on your side?

61
00:06:41,400 --> 00:06:43,611
A person who will stay
by your side forever

62
00:06:43,694 --> 00:06:46,614
in place of your mom and dad.

63
00:06:47,281 --> 00:06:49,534
I hope you'll meet him soon.

64
00:07:28,364 --> 00:07:31,284
This is where I am.
I'll call you after my date.

65
00:07:33,494 --> 00:07:34,996
Is the date not over yet?

66
00:07:47,508 --> 00:07:50,219
Your call cannot be connected
and will go to voicemail.

67
00:07:50,303 --> 00:07:52,722
Charges will apply after the beep.

68
00:07:55,766 --> 00:07:56,893
POWER OFF

69
00:08:11,491 --> 00:08:13,784
You shouldn't have
brought attention to yourself.

70
00:08:44,398 --> 00:08:46,234
You should've kept to yourself.

71
00:08:57,870 --> 00:09:00,289
Okay. Thank you.

72
00:09:03,918 --> 00:09:05,795
She hasn't called home either.

73
00:09:05,878 --> 00:09:07,547
What about her secretary?

74
00:09:07,630 --> 00:09:09,048
He said the same thing.

75
00:09:09,715 --> 00:09:12,510
I shouldn't have set them up.

76
00:09:12,593 --> 00:09:13,886
It didn't feel right.

77
00:09:13,970 --> 00:09:15,513
Don't blame yourself.

78
00:09:15,596 --> 00:09:17,473
Nothing has happened yet.

79
00:09:18,641 --> 00:09:19,892
In-a will be fine.

80
00:10:08,316 --> 00:10:09,442
Damn it.

81
00:10:27,835 --> 00:10:30,212
Hey, In-a. What just happened?

82
00:10:31,922 --> 00:10:35,635
You have to see what men do
when they're drunk.

83
00:10:35,718 --> 00:10:37,386
Is that a nosebleed?

84
00:10:38,512 --> 00:10:41,515
He got drunk as a skunk,
so I taught him a lesson.

85
00:10:41,599 --> 00:10:43,184
Why you…

86
00:10:45,728 --> 00:10:46,854
Hey.

87
00:10:48,105 --> 00:10:49,565
Give me your phone.

88
00:10:51,901 --> 00:10:53,986
I know you took pictures of me.

89
00:11:14,423 --> 00:11:17,843
If you do this one more time,
I'll come after you.

90
00:11:43,119 --> 00:11:45,830
Thanks, Ha-na.

91
00:11:54,713 --> 00:11:57,883
If there's alcohol there,
just pretend to drink.

92
00:11:57,967 --> 00:11:59,385
I'll come and get you.

93
00:12:04,306 --> 00:12:07,184
I'm not a fast runner, you see.

94
00:12:07,768 --> 00:12:09,645
How can you joke at a time like this?

95
00:12:09,728 --> 00:12:11,021
You were in danger.

96
00:12:11,105 --> 00:12:13,482
If you knew he was a bastard,
you should've just left

97
00:12:13,566 --> 00:12:15,151
instead of teaching him a lesson!

98
00:12:17,403 --> 00:12:19,864
Are you blaming me
while pretending to be on my side?

99
00:12:20,698 --> 00:12:23,325
You should be asking if I'm okay instead.

100
00:12:26,787 --> 00:12:27,830
Yes, well…

101
00:12:29,665 --> 00:12:30,958
I'm on Ha-na's side.

102
00:12:32,501 --> 00:12:34,336
No, thank you.

103
00:12:34,420 --> 00:12:37,131
Hey, she just turned you down.

104
00:12:37,214 --> 00:12:39,175
Give it a rest already.

105
00:12:40,509 --> 00:12:41,635
I don't want to.

106
00:12:42,511 --> 00:12:45,181
Whatever. You're being so obvious.

107
00:12:46,390 --> 00:12:49,226
I turned down people
who offered to be on my side

108
00:12:50,311 --> 00:12:52,271
and chose to stand alone.

109
00:12:54,857 --> 00:12:59,570
I don't have the confidence
to be on anyone's side.

110
00:13:33,687 --> 00:13:37,233
"The Marriage Morale Bust Team
is corrupt and must dissolve"?

111
00:13:38,025 --> 00:13:39,860
How did this happen?

112
00:13:41,862 --> 00:13:43,948
Maybe they were really rude.

113
00:13:50,287 --> 00:13:52,289
SINGLE LIFE IS THE ANSWER

114
00:13:52,373 --> 00:13:54,416
ELIMINATE ADMINISTRATIVE WASTE
FORCING MARRIAGE!

115
00:14:01,131 --> 00:14:02,591
Sir.

116
00:14:04,510 --> 00:14:05,803
Take a look at this.

117
00:14:06,303 --> 00:14:07,471
I already know.

118
00:14:07,555 --> 00:14:10,224
How could anyone do this
to our precious city hall?

119
00:14:10,307 --> 00:14:13,519
We need to catch this bastard
and throw him in jail.

120
00:14:14,103 --> 00:14:18,107
Boosting marriage morale is
part of your grand plan for our citizens.

121
00:14:18,190 --> 00:14:22,486
How dare they try to misrepresent
your intentions like this?

122
00:14:23,988 --> 00:14:26,657
Sir, I've secured all CCTV footage.

123
00:14:26,740 --> 00:14:29,159
At least one camera must have caught him.

124
00:14:30,536 --> 00:14:32,079
Is that the best thing to do?

125
00:14:32,162 --> 00:14:33,080
Excuse me?

126
00:14:33,664 --> 00:14:36,417
I'll take care of this matter quietly.

127
00:14:37,626 --> 00:14:41,171
Imagine what everyone will say
about this issue.

128
00:14:41,255 --> 00:14:43,591
There's no point in making matters worse.

129
00:14:43,674 --> 00:14:46,677
I see. You're the best, sir.

130
00:14:48,470 --> 00:14:49,513
Please leave now.

131
00:14:49,597 --> 00:14:50,681
Yes, sir.

132
00:15:00,566 --> 00:15:02,943
SINGLE LIFE IS THE ANSWER

133
00:15:03,027 --> 00:15:05,404
ELIMINATE ADMINISTRATIVE WASTE
FORCING MARRIAGE!

134
00:15:10,993 --> 00:15:12,703
The lobby was bad enough,

135
00:15:12,786 --> 00:15:16,123
but we received this many hate comments
between yesterday morning and 2:00 p.m.

136
00:15:16,206 --> 00:15:18,834
WHY FORCE MARRIAGE YOU CAN'T
TAKE RESPONSIBILITY FOR

137
00:15:18,918 --> 00:15:23,714
Since then, people have been canceling
their applications and blind dates.

138
00:15:25,132 --> 00:15:27,635
What if our team disbands?

139
00:15:27,718 --> 00:15:29,428
We can't let that happen.

140
00:15:29,511 --> 00:15:33,557
I told Ms. Lee I'd hold down the fort
until she comes back.

141
00:15:35,434 --> 00:15:38,854
Mr. Yang, track down
the hate comments and their IP addresses

142
00:15:38,938 --> 00:15:40,230
as quickly as possible.

143
00:15:40,314 --> 00:15:42,024
Yes, sir. I'll take care of it.

144
00:15:42,566 --> 00:15:45,194
Anything else to report, Ms. Jeong?

145
00:15:45,277 --> 00:15:48,781
Ms. Oh In-a and Mr. Joo Dong-seok had
their second blind date yesterday.

146
00:15:49,406 --> 00:15:51,325
- Did it go well?
- How did it go?

147
00:15:51,408 --> 00:15:54,328
We need that case to go well
for the mayor to show us leniency.

148
00:15:55,996 --> 00:15:57,414
It didn't work out.

149
00:15:59,959 --> 00:16:02,544
The afternoon date went well enough.

150
00:16:02,628 --> 00:16:05,005
Then Mr. Joo got
drunk as a skunk that night.

151
00:16:05,089 --> 00:16:06,048
A skunk?

152
00:16:06,131 --> 00:16:07,257
- A skunk?
- Skunk?

153
00:16:08,133 --> 00:16:10,344
But he's not that kind of person.

154
00:16:11,387 --> 00:16:13,931
How do you know that, Mr. Yang?

155
00:16:15,808 --> 00:16:18,268
I mean, I can tell by his facial features.

156
00:16:19,979 --> 00:16:23,148
He exhibited
a deliberate act of disrespect.

157
00:16:23,232 --> 00:16:25,109
We'll need to blacklist him.

158
00:16:30,155 --> 00:16:31,824
- Give it to me!
- No!

159
00:16:31,907 --> 00:16:33,450
It's mine!

160
00:16:35,619 --> 00:16:37,997
Why are you packing all of a sudden?

161
00:16:38,080 --> 00:16:40,874
We should head back to Cheongdo now.

162
00:16:42,001 --> 00:16:43,711
Does that mean Ha-na…

163
00:16:43,794 --> 00:16:46,255
I mean, is Aunt Ha-na going with us?

164
00:16:47,881 --> 00:16:50,634
Are we going to
live on the island together?

165
00:16:52,219 --> 00:16:54,054
No, we're not.

166
00:16:55,139 --> 00:16:58,058
Your school break is almost over,
so you need to head back.

167
00:16:58,142 --> 00:16:59,977
Then what about Aunt Ha-na?

168
00:17:01,687 --> 00:17:04,106
Ha-na needs to stay in Injeong City.

169
00:17:04,189 --> 00:17:06,400
She has to keep working
as a civil servant.

170
00:17:06,483 --> 00:17:11,655
Wait, did it not work out
with you and Aunt Ha-na?

171
00:17:12,281 --> 00:17:13,490
It didn't?

172
00:17:17,161 --> 00:17:19,663
Say something, will you?

173
00:17:23,083 --> 00:17:25,836
This is so frustrating!

174
00:17:27,629 --> 00:17:32,134
This is grown-up stuff
that kids don't know about.

175
00:17:34,303 --> 00:17:35,971
What's the big deal?

176
00:17:36,055 --> 00:17:38,390
- I don't want to go.
- What's he talking about?

177
00:17:38,474 --> 00:17:40,267
Something happened to our uncle.

178
00:17:44,855 --> 00:17:46,523
Did you track down the IP addresses?

179
00:17:48,817 --> 00:17:51,236
I only managed to find one address.

180
00:17:53,530 --> 00:17:57,367
"Injeong City, Nam-gu, Asan 1-gil, 16."

181
00:17:57,951 --> 00:18:00,913
The suspect was right under our nose.

182
00:18:04,374 --> 00:18:07,044
What time were the comments
posted from this address?

183
00:18:07,127 --> 00:18:10,631
This is the address where all those posts
came from yesterday morning.

184
00:18:10,714 --> 00:18:13,258
I'm checking to see
if any earlier posts came from there.

185
00:18:14,301 --> 00:18:18,639
So what now?
Shall I report this straight to the mayor?

186
00:18:18,722 --> 00:18:21,934
Good work. I'll take care of this quietly.

187
00:18:22,017 --> 00:18:23,102
Excuse me?

188
00:18:24,103 --> 00:18:25,521
Quietly, sir?

189
00:18:35,489 --> 00:18:38,117
I'M NOT MARRIED
AND LIVE JUST FINE

190
00:18:38,200 --> 00:18:40,119
INCREASE YOUTH ALLOWANCE INSTEAD

191
00:18:40,202 --> 00:18:41,703
DISSOLVE
MARRIAGE MORALE BOOST TEAM

192
00:18:44,123 --> 00:18:47,459
If this is what they want,
I should oblige them.

193
00:18:56,343 --> 00:18:58,262
The mayor promised me

194
00:18:58,345 --> 00:19:00,806
a department transfer
if I succeeded with Mr. Bong.

195
00:19:03,976 --> 00:19:05,310
THE MAYOR HAS LOST HIS MIND

196
00:19:05,394 --> 00:19:07,479
IRRESPONSIBLE PEOPLE
SHOULDN'T GET MARRIED

197
00:19:09,189 --> 00:19:13,861
INJEONG CITY,
NAM-GU, ASAN 1-GIL, 16

198
00:19:20,576 --> 00:19:24,079
Your call cannot be connected
and will go to voicemail.

199
00:19:40,387 --> 00:19:41,805
SEO-GU, SARYONG-GIL 21-5

200
00:19:46,685 --> 00:19:48,395
- Mr. Yang.
- Yes?

201
00:19:51,106 --> 00:19:53,358
You said nothing came up
from this address, right?

202
00:19:55,694 --> 00:19:58,739
Right. Whose address is this?

203
00:19:59,656 --> 00:20:01,491
Mr. Joo Dong-seok.

204
00:20:01,575 --> 00:20:05,829
Ms. Jeong, you shouldn't suspect
an innocent person

205
00:20:05,913 --> 00:20:07,331
no matter how urgent the situation feels.

206
00:20:07,414 --> 00:20:09,541
He's not an innocent person.

207
00:20:09,625 --> 00:20:12,044
Yesterday's date could've gone badly.

208
00:20:13,837 --> 00:20:16,590
I have a bad feeling about him.

209
00:20:16,673 --> 00:20:20,802
Look, I talked to Mr. Joo
on the phone earlier.

210
00:20:20,886 --> 00:20:23,889
He said he tried to take Ms. Oh home
because she was too drunk.

211
00:20:23,972 --> 00:20:26,308
You shouldn't accuse people like that.

212
00:20:27,142 --> 00:20:29,311
He even lied about it?

213
00:20:34,233 --> 00:20:35,275
Hello.

214
00:20:37,736 --> 00:20:38,820
Ms. Jeong.

215
00:20:38,904 --> 00:20:41,657
The mayor wants to see you and Mr. Choi.

216
00:20:44,952 --> 00:20:46,453
He wants to see me?

217
00:20:53,710 --> 00:20:55,087
Why? What is it?

218
00:20:58,966 --> 00:21:03,262
I stole a glance at the IP address
that Mr. Yang found.

219
00:21:03,345 --> 00:21:06,098
Why did you do that
when Mr. Choi is handling the matter?

220
00:21:07,307 --> 00:21:08,475
He won't be able to.

221
00:21:08,558 --> 00:21:09,601
Why?

222
00:21:09,685 --> 00:21:12,479
Because I think the address
belongs to Ms. Jeong.

223
00:21:12,562 --> 00:21:13,939
- What?
- Hush!

224
00:21:17,276 --> 00:21:20,362
That's why the mayor called Ms. Jeong in.

225
00:21:21,613 --> 00:21:24,908
Ms. Jeong never liked working on the team.

226
00:21:24,992 --> 00:21:28,620
She was promised a transfer
if she succeeded in matching Mr. Bong.

227
00:21:29,204 --> 00:21:30,706
Where did you hear that from?

228
00:21:31,415 --> 00:21:33,208
You're missing the point.

229
00:21:33,292 --> 00:21:36,336
What's shocking is that
Ms. Jeong was never on our side.

230
00:21:38,046 --> 00:21:39,881
If that's true, then…

231
00:21:39,965 --> 00:21:41,133
It's obvious.

232
00:21:41,216 --> 00:21:44,886
The team will get dissolved,
and that will be the end of my internship.

233
00:21:47,514 --> 00:21:50,517
I hope I don't get dismissed
before the end of my probation period.

234
00:21:54,771 --> 00:21:56,523
Ms. Moon?

235
00:21:57,149 --> 00:21:59,568
I don't think I want to hear this.

236
00:22:00,319 --> 00:22:02,070
I want to leave.

237
00:22:03,947 --> 00:22:07,743
It'll be easy for me to tell you
since you already have an idea.

238
00:22:10,746 --> 00:22:15,042
I'm going back to Cheongdo.

239
00:22:15,125 --> 00:22:16,668
Is it because of Ha-na?

240
00:22:17,461 --> 00:22:20,881
She said she liked kissing you.
What's the matter with her?

241
00:22:22,632 --> 00:22:23,717
She liked it?

242
00:22:24,509 --> 00:22:27,095
I shouldn't be the one to tell you this.

243
00:22:28,555 --> 00:22:30,182
What else did she like?

244
00:22:30,265 --> 00:22:32,017
I don't know. Ask her yourself.

245
00:22:32,100 --> 00:22:34,186
She would need days to list everything.

246
00:22:35,687 --> 00:22:40,400
I don't think she feels
comfortable around me like before.

247
00:22:42,569 --> 00:22:44,696
She's so frustrating.

248
00:22:45,655 --> 00:22:48,700
If you like someone,
you kiss them, sleep with them,

249
00:22:48,784 --> 00:22:51,078
marry them, and live with them.

250
00:22:51,161 --> 00:22:53,205
Why does she complicate things?

251
00:22:53,288 --> 00:22:54,956
I'd like to try it again myself.

252
00:22:55,499 --> 00:22:58,835
But marriage isn't
just about liking each other.

253
00:22:58,919 --> 00:23:02,214
It's about living with someone
who's on my side forever.

254
00:23:03,298 --> 00:23:06,301
Now that you say that,
I guess you're right.

255
00:23:06,885 --> 00:23:09,554
So have you told Ha-na
you're going back to Cheongdo?

256
00:23:11,431 --> 00:23:12,891
No, not yet.

257
00:23:13,809 --> 00:23:15,894
I'll get to it at some point.

258
00:23:16,394 --> 00:23:18,730
Like, today? Now? Right this moment?

259
00:23:20,107 --> 00:23:23,777
I'm afraid that won't work for Ha-na.

260
00:23:25,487 --> 00:23:26,530
Why?

261
00:23:27,114 --> 00:23:28,740
Is something the matter with her?

262
00:23:29,991 --> 00:23:32,160
I think her team is in big trouble.

263
00:23:32,244 --> 00:23:33,411
What?

264
00:23:35,163 --> 00:23:36,540
You can't tell her today.

265
00:23:45,340 --> 00:23:48,385
I heard you reviewed
the CCTV footage yourself, sir.

266
00:23:49,136 --> 00:23:50,595
That's right.

267
00:23:50,679 --> 00:23:53,849
But the suspect's face wasn't visible.

268
00:23:56,101 --> 00:23:58,645
They spray painted the camera.

269
00:23:59,312 --> 00:24:02,023
This is one smart person.

270
00:24:02,107 --> 00:24:04,734
I'll ask the police for cooperation
and look into it more.

271
00:24:05,861 --> 00:24:09,030
Mr. Choi, why make this
a bigger deal than it already is

272
00:24:10,448 --> 00:24:12,117
when the instigator is right here?

273
00:24:13,952 --> 00:24:15,328
The instigator, sir?

274
00:24:26,256 --> 00:24:28,842
INJEONG CITY,
NAM-GU, ASAN 1-GIL, 16

275
00:24:29,593 --> 00:24:32,387
Why is my address on here?

276
00:24:32,470 --> 00:24:35,348
That's what I want to ask you, Ms. Jeong.

277
00:24:35,891 --> 00:24:38,393
Did you hate the team this much?

278
00:24:39,352 --> 00:24:41,646
After you failed
every assignment I gave you,

279
00:24:41,730 --> 00:24:43,940
did you decide
to get things done your way?

280
00:24:44,024 --> 00:24:45,775
It wasn't me, sir.

281
00:24:46,443 --> 00:24:49,946
And why did you play dumb
after getting this report?

282
00:24:52,699 --> 00:24:55,076
Because I wasn't done fact-checking, sir.

283
00:24:55,160 --> 00:24:57,245
Fact-checking?

284
00:24:57,329 --> 00:25:00,665
Right. You should always fact-check.

285
00:25:01,708 --> 00:25:02,834
Ms. Jeong.

286
00:25:03,627 --> 00:25:05,378
Between yesterday morning and 2:00 p.m.,

287
00:25:05,462 --> 00:25:08,423
where were you and what were you doing?

288
00:25:10,300 --> 00:25:13,637
Honey, will you have a coffee with me?

289
00:25:14,763 --> 00:25:16,014
Sure.

290
00:25:16,097 --> 00:25:18,016
- Let's go.
- Okay.

291
00:25:18,850 --> 00:25:19,935
And two nights ago?

292
00:25:21,061 --> 00:25:23,813
I like your uncle lots and lots.

293
00:25:24,564 --> 00:25:26,775
- She said "lots and lots"!
- "Lots and lots"!

294
00:25:31,029 --> 00:25:32,364
And three nights ago?

295
00:25:42,624 --> 00:25:46,419
I'll take responsibility for you.

296
00:25:50,090 --> 00:25:52,384
I want you to prove who you were with

297
00:25:52,467 --> 00:25:55,053
and what you were doing
when all of those posts were made.

298
00:25:55,136 --> 00:25:58,390
If you do that, then I'll believe you.

299
00:25:59,683 --> 00:26:03,478
What's wrong?
Is there something you want to hide?

300
00:26:10,026 --> 00:26:13,446
You want Mr. Bong's case
to work out, right?

301
00:26:13,530 --> 00:26:14,656
Excuse me?

302
00:26:14,739 --> 00:26:17,534
I trust you'll keep your work
and personal life separate

303
00:26:17,617 --> 00:26:19,119
as you dislike trouble.

304
00:26:23,123 --> 00:26:25,542
After failing every assignment,

305
00:26:25,625 --> 00:26:27,961
and having no justification
to leave the team,

306
00:26:28,044 --> 00:26:30,547
did you try to get rid
of the team entirely

307
00:26:30,630 --> 00:26:32,757
by posting hate comments
these past few days?

308
00:26:34,592 --> 00:26:37,178
Ms. Jeong, say something.

309
00:26:39,389 --> 00:26:43,143
In my 40 years as a civil servant,
I've never been so offended.

310
00:26:45,103 --> 00:26:48,189
Sir, these files aren't right.

311
00:26:48,273 --> 00:26:49,649
I'm being set up.

312
00:26:49,733 --> 00:26:52,986
Since you want to see
this team dissolved so badly,

313
00:26:53,069 --> 00:26:55,989
as the mayor,
I feel obligated to fulfill your wish.

314
00:26:56,531 --> 00:26:59,034
What do you think, Mr. Choi?

315
00:26:59,117 --> 00:27:00,660
Sir, I don't think--

316
00:27:02,120 --> 00:27:03,913
Just give me one more day.

317
00:27:03,997 --> 00:27:06,583
I'll bring you proof
that will support my alibi.

318
00:27:06,666 --> 00:27:08,126
What for?

319
00:27:08,209 --> 00:27:10,545
I'm dissolving the team,
just like you wanted.

320
00:27:10,628 --> 00:27:12,255
Is that not good enough for you?

321
00:27:14,966 --> 00:27:16,051
Sir.

322
00:27:16,134 --> 00:27:19,721
Everyone on this team feels
a great sense of duty in our work.

323
00:27:19,804 --> 00:27:22,098
The same goes for Ms. Jeong.

324
00:27:22,182 --> 00:27:24,392
Please trust us one more time and wait.

325
00:27:28,855 --> 00:27:30,899
It must be nice, Ms. Jeong,

326
00:27:30,982 --> 00:27:32,609
to have Mr. Choi on your side.

327
00:27:34,652 --> 00:27:36,529
Please, sir.

328
00:27:40,867 --> 00:27:44,245
Fine. I'll give you until tomorrow.

329
00:27:44,329 --> 00:27:47,457
After tomorrow,
I'll hold you fully responsible

330
00:27:47,540 --> 00:27:50,960
and dissolve
the Marriage Morale Boost Team.

331
00:27:57,217 --> 00:28:00,178
I took time out and came here
as a favor to Yeong-eun,

332
00:28:00,261 --> 00:28:02,931
but there's a big problem with the team.

333
00:28:03,014 --> 00:28:05,141
I need to get back quickly.

334
00:28:05,725 --> 00:28:07,143
That's why I'm here.

335
00:28:08,436 --> 00:28:11,272
I wanted to know if I could help.

336
00:28:12,440 --> 00:28:13,400
You, Mr. Bong?

337
00:28:15,068 --> 00:28:19,656
Then did Ms. Jeong
ever seem suspicious to you?

338
00:28:19,739 --> 00:28:21,741
Suspicious? Ha-na?

339
00:28:23,368 --> 00:28:25,870
She wouldn't do anything like that.

340
00:28:25,954 --> 00:28:31,084
Are you telling me that Ms. Jeong
didn't deliberately sabotage your case?

341
00:28:31,167 --> 00:28:34,337
Ha-na would never do something like that!

342
00:28:34,421 --> 00:28:37,048
You can't suspect her like this!

343
00:28:37,549 --> 00:28:40,009
She pulled a fast one on you too!

344
00:28:40,719 --> 00:28:41,678
There's even proof.

345
00:28:42,971 --> 00:28:45,557
If Ms. Jeong is really innocent,

346
00:28:45,640 --> 00:28:48,601
then explain how the IP addresses
of the hate comments

347
00:28:48,685 --> 00:28:51,813
all trace back to her home address?

348
00:28:53,898 --> 00:28:55,734
They really set her up.

349
00:28:55,817 --> 00:28:58,903
Wait until I get my hands on that bastard.

350
00:29:00,405 --> 00:29:05,326
Didn't you say the bastard
who hung the banner early that morning

351
00:29:05,410 --> 00:29:07,328
wasn't caught on camera?

352
00:29:08,580 --> 00:29:12,417
He's obviously the culprit and instigator,
so why are you hiding that fact?

353
00:29:12,500 --> 00:29:14,377
We're not hiding anything.

354
00:29:14,461 --> 00:29:16,337
We already have the instigator,

355
00:29:16,421 --> 00:29:19,549
so there's no point in making this
into an even bigger deal.

356
00:29:19,632 --> 00:29:20,884
What?

357
00:29:20,967 --> 00:29:22,802
If the IP addresses were fake,

358
00:29:22,886 --> 00:29:26,264
all Ms. Jeong had to do
was provide an airtight alibi

359
00:29:26,347 --> 00:29:28,808
proving where and with whom she was,

360
00:29:28,892 --> 00:29:31,019
but she couldn't say anything.

361
00:29:34,606 --> 00:29:35,482
Well, she…

362
00:29:36,065 --> 00:29:39,068
She could have personal reasons for that.

363
00:29:40,069 --> 00:29:43,156
It's not right to go after her like this!

364
00:29:44,032 --> 00:29:46,534
You'll end up losing the real culprit.

365
00:29:55,710 --> 00:30:01,299
By the way, when does this get delivered?

366
00:30:01,883 --> 00:30:03,510
Every morning at dawn.

367
00:30:06,387 --> 00:30:08,306
At dawn?

368
00:30:46,970 --> 00:30:48,596
I'm sorry, everyone.

369
00:30:49,180 --> 00:30:53,518
I promise to set things straight tomorrow
and keep our team together.

370
00:30:56,062 --> 00:30:57,272
Ms. Jeong.

371
00:30:58,648 --> 00:31:00,108
Can I see you for a minute?

372
00:31:08,575 --> 00:31:10,952
Of all people, I deserve an explanation.

373
00:31:11,619 --> 00:31:13,955
I can't tell you anything right now.

374
00:31:14,998 --> 00:31:19,127
Besides, it's true
I wanted to leave this team.

375
00:31:20,503 --> 00:31:23,256
That was for a different reason.
Why are you acting like this?

376
00:31:23,339 --> 00:31:26,134
No, it's still my problem.

377
00:31:28,136 --> 00:31:31,598
I don't want the team to think
that I'm making excuses.

378
00:31:33,558 --> 00:31:35,894
All the evidence points to you.

379
00:31:35,977 --> 00:31:38,938
Everyone suspects you.
This isn't something you can hide.

380
00:31:39,022 --> 00:31:41,566
We need to know
what's going on to help you.

381
00:31:44,193 --> 00:31:45,778
I'll tell you tomorrow.

382
00:31:46,738 --> 00:31:48,907
Is there something else
that can be misconstrued?

383
00:31:48,990 --> 00:31:50,950
Why is it okay to tell me tomorrow
but not today?

384
00:31:53,244 --> 00:31:56,623
I'll take care of it myself.
It's my problem after all.

385
00:31:58,583 --> 00:32:01,628
I'm sorry I caused trouble for the team.

386
00:32:11,638 --> 00:32:13,723
You can at least give me
a chance to help you.

387
00:32:22,899 --> 00:32:26,444
This isn't the ending I hoped for.

388
00:32:29,697 --> 00:32:33,409
Why couldn't I bring myself
to tell the truth?

389
00:32:34,118 --> 00:32:35,912
Between yesterday morning and 2:00 p.m.,

390
00:32:35,995 --> 00:32:38,998
where were you and what were you doing?

391
00:32:41,250 --> 00:32:44,003
Maybe it wasn't for Cheol-hui.

392
00:32:44,087 --> 00:32:47,298
Maybe I hid the truth to protect myself.

393
00:32:48,216 --> 00:32:50,510
Of all people, I deserve an explanation.

394
00:32:50,593 --> 00:32:52,845
Is there something else
that can be misconstrued?

395
00:32:54,055 --> 00:32:57,642
What choice would Cheol-hui have made?

396
00:33:05,566 --> 00:33:07,318
Ha-na…

397
00:33:17,662 --> 00:33:20,331
How are things these days?

398
00:33:20,415 --> 00:33:22,041
Just the usual.

399
00:33:23,626 --> 00:33:26,379
But what brings you here?
Did you want to see me?

400
00:33:26,462 --> 00:33:28,339
No.

401
00:33:30,049 --> 00:33:31,175
I mean…

402
00:33:34,053 --> 00:33:35,138
Yes, I did.

403
00:33:35,221 --> 00:33:36,723
But…

404
00:33:40,560 --> 00:33:41,811
I'm over you, Cheol-hui.

405
00:33:43,146 --> 00:33:45,231
I'm not the clingy type.

406
00:33:47,942 --> 00:33:49,444
That's good to hear.

407
00:33:50,028 --> 00:33:52,030
So what really brings you here?

408
00:33:54,240 --> 00:33:57,410
I have a favor to ask you.

409
00:33:58,995 --> 00:34:00,204
A favor?

410
00:34:01,539 --> 00:34:03,833
Do you need money or something?

411
00:34:04,667 --> 00:34:07,003
No, it's not that.

412
00:34:09,714 --> 00:34:14,177
It's about the Dyan Mart
delivery truck that delivers at dawn.

413
00:34:25,271 --> 00:34:27,690
Uncle said he was
going to see Aunt Ha-na, right?

414
00:34:27,774 --> 00:34:29,817
Yes, it's his last chance.

415
00:34:31,027 --> 00:34:32,445
I hope it goes well.

416
00:34:35,448 --> 00:34:38,493
How am I going to pack
all of that in here?

417
00:34:39,660 --> 00:34:40,912
Geez.

418
00:34:45,458 --> 00:34:47,335
Can you take some of mine?

419
00:34:47,418 --> 00:34:49,253
Forget it.

420
00:34:51,547 --> 00:34:53,341
You're so selfish.

421
00:34:54,926 --> 00:34:56,719
You're younger than me.

422
00:34:57,303 --> 00:34:59,430
And you have a lot of room.

423
00:35:04,227 --> 00:35:05,228
Ha-na!

424
00:35:14,445 --> 00:35:17,406
I was on pins and needles waiting for you.

425
00:35:17,490 --> 00:35:19,117
Do you know how worried I was?

426
00:35:21,536 --> 00:35:23,788
I heard your team came under attack.

427
00:35:24,997 --> 00:35:26,290
I know all about it.

428
00:35:28,459 --> 00:35:31,587
He's more worried about me than himself.

429
00:35:32,130 --> 00:35:34,674
You don't have to protect me.

430
00:35:35,967 --> 00:35:39,011
Why did you hide our date
and get yourself in trouble?

431
00:35:39,595 --> 00:35:43,766
He doesn't jump to conclusions
and waits for me instead.

432
00:35:43,850 --> 00:35:45,685
You should've just said

433
00:35:45,768 --> 00:35:49,021
that Bong Cheol-hui kept
pursuing and bothering you.

434
00:35:50,940 --> 00:35:53,442
Ha-na, no matter what you say,

435
00:35:54,443 --> 00:35:56,028
I'm on your side.

436
00:35:59,157 --> 00:36:02,743
Cheol-hui is on my side.

437
00:36:03,953 --> 00:36:05,121
Thank you.

438
00:36:19,760 --> 00:36:20,761
Look at this.

439
00:36:23,973 --> 00:36:27,059
That guy in the black hat and mask.

440
00:36:28,144 --> 00:36:29,478
He looks suspicious, right?

441
00:36:29,562 --> 00:36:31,105
The time code in this footage

442
00:36:31,189 --> 00:36:34,400
is very close to when the camera
in the city hall was spray painted.

443
00:36:34,483 --> 00:36:37,653
He got caught on this dashcam
after making that mess in the lobby.

444
00:36:40,072 --> 00:36:43,242
But this isn't enough to identify him.

445
00:36:43,826 --> 00:36:46,204
I thought of that, so I had it blown up.

446
00:36:55,880 --> 00:36:57,632
I still can't tell.

447
00:36:58,799 --> 00:37:00,509
Look at his wrist.

448
00:37:01,093 --> 00:37:02,345
There's a silver bracelet.

449
00:37:04,180 --> 00:37:06,015
Hey, that's…

450
00:37:06,515 --> 00:37:09,352
You wrote that marriage is
a responsibility.

451
00:37:09,435 --> 00:37:10,478
Yes.

452
00:37:11,771 --> 00:37:12,813
Obviously.

453
00:37:22,490 --> 00:37:25,159
Mr. Joo Dong-seok wore the same bracelet.

454
00:37:25,243 --> 00:37:28,246
Right. In-a's blind date.

455
00:37:28,329 --> 00:37:30,414
He had it on yesterday too.

456
00:37:30,498 --> 00:37:32,250
I remember it clearly.

457
00:37:35,211 --> 00:37:36,796
Is it really him?

458
00:37:37,797 --> 00:37:41,175
The thing is, their blind date ended
rather strangely yesterday.

459
00:37:41,926 --> 00:37:44,345
We caught him
trying to do something with her.

460
00:37:45,054 --> 00:37:47,765
Yes, I heard about that from In-a.

461
00:37:47,848 --> 00:37:49,767
I got this dashcam footage

462
00:37:49,850 --> 00:37:52,353
from a Dyan Mart delivery truck.

463
00:37:54,397 --> 00:37:56,774
But there's no proof
he's the one who posted

464
00:37:56,857 --> 00:37:58,818
the hate comments
through fake IP addresses.

465
00:38:01,821 --> 00:38:04,907
There's a connection.

466
00:38:10,371 --> 00:38:12,456
POSTED BY: HONG GIL-DONG

467
00:38:12,540 --> 00:38:16,252
This bastard, Joo Dong-seok, is well-known
in the misogynistic online community.

468
00:38:17,753 --> 00:38:21,007
When the mayor kept
pushing people to get married,

469
00:38:21,090 --> 00:38:22,341
he got really irritated.

470
00:38:23,843 --> 00:38:24,969
Hong Gil-dong?

471
00:38:27,888 --> 00:38:32,143
So how about it?
Shall we go catch this bastard?

472
00:38:33,519 --> 00:38:35,813
I'D RATHER DIE ALONE
THAN MARRY A WOMAN

473
00:38:40,109 --> 00:38:41,110
Hold on.

474
00:38:47,283 --> 00:38:48,659
Someone's inside.

475
00:38:53,331 --> 00:38:54,498
This is the right place.

476
00:38:56,625 --> 00:38:57,501
Who is it?

477
00:39:03,591 --> 00:39:05,176
Sir?

478
00:39:10,097 --> 00:39:11,932
SINGLE LIFE IS THE ANSWER

479
00:39:35,790 --> 00:39:37,166
Dad, this is all your fault!

480
00:39:49,428 --> 00:39:52,014
How could you do this, sir?

481
00:39:52,098 --> 00:39:54,266
Did you cover up the culprit on purpose?

482
00:39:55,643 --> 00:39:56,519
Ms. Jeong…

483
00:39:56,602 --> 00:39:58,771
How could you frame Ha-na like this?

484
00:40:00,356 --> 00:40:02,316
No matter how important your child is,

485
00:40:02,400 --> 00:40:05,027
you can't dissolve the team
to cover up a crime!

486
00:40:05,611 --> 00:40:09,698
But isn't that what you wanted, Ms. Jeong?

487
00:40:10,741 --> 00:40:11,867
Everything aside,

488
00:40:11,951 --> 00:40:14,829
I thought you and I were on the same page.

489
00:40:16,038 --> 00:40:17,790
Not like this.

490
00:40:19,542 --> 00:40:21,460
Did it occur to you that things got worse

491
00:40:21,544 --> 00:40:23,546
after hiding your relationship
with Mr. Bong?

492
00:40:25,756 --> 00:40:29,385
If Mr. Joo didn't do this
in the first place, we wouldn't be here.

493
00:40:29,468 --> 00:40:31,137
You can't place the blame on her.

494
00:40:33,514 --> 00:40:35,933
I'm formally raising an issue about this.

495
00:40:36,016 --> 00:40:37,685
I have enough evidence to do so.

496
00:40:37,768 --> 00:40:39,979
Ms. Jeong.

497
00:40:43,107 --> 00:40:45,276
I had the wrong idea.

498
00:40:45,359 --> 00:40:48,571
Please reconsider what you just said.

499
00:40:49,655 --> 00:40:53,325
Dong-seok has suffered a lot.

500
00:40:53,993 --> 00:40:58,038
He was born out of wedlock
and then abandoned by his mother.

501
00:40:58,122 --> 00:41:00,124
He's been through a lot of pain.

502
00:41:00,207 --> 00:41:03,461
I started this marriage project
in the hopes that

503
00:41:03,544 --> 00:41:07,882
Dong-seok might meet someone
and become happy.

504
00:41:10,092 --> 00:41:13,262
I was so confident
that I lived a good life.

505
00:41:14,930 --> 00:41:17,224
But that wasn't the case
when it came to my child.

506
00:41:24,273 --> 00:41:25,107
Ms. Jeong.

507
00:41:26,108 --> 00:41:28,360
I'll do whatever you want.

508
00:41:28,444 --> 00:41:31,280
I'll resign as mayor if necessary.

509
00:41:33,866 --> 00:41:35,409
But my son

510
00:41:36,494 --> 00:41:38,412
only has me on his side.

511
00:41:39,872 --> 00:41:41,749
Please let me protect him.

512
00:41:43,876 --> 00:41:45,085
Help me.

513
00:41:49,507 --> 00:41:50,883
I beg of you.

514
00:41:53,093 --> 00:41:54,261
Sir…

515
00:42:22,414 --> 00:42:24,792
It's late, but he's not back yet, so…

516
00:42:24,875 --> 00:42:27,378
We should probably unpack, right?

517
00:42:28,462 --> 00:42:31,882
It finally looks like
they'll walk down the aisle.

518
00:42:31,966 --> 00:42:33,842
It's a sure thing now.

519
00:42:33,926 --> 00:42:35,636
It sure is.

520
00:42:35,719 --> 00:42:37,721
You have to really pull it together now.

521
00:42:38,347 --> 00:42:41,809
We can't let anything happen
until the wedding.

522
00:42:41,892 --> 00:42:45,354
I'm fine. You're the one
who needs to do well.

523
00:42:55,072 --> 00:42:57,741
- It's uncle!
- Uncle!

524
00:43:04,415 --> 00:43:05,791
What happened?

525
00:43:06,542 --> 00:43:08,544
Do we have to pack again?

526
00:43:10,212 --> 00:43:11,964
Did it not work out?

527
00:43:21,223 --> 00:43:22,641
We just finished unpacking.

528
00:43:33,819 --> 00:43:35,362
Toothbrush…

529
00:43:47,541 --> 00:43:50,711
I knew things would work out.

530
00:43:50,794 --> 00:43:52,087
Same here, sir.

531
00:43:52,838 --> 00:43:55,049
When did you get here, Ms. Jeong?

532
00:43:55,132 --> 00:43:56,133
There you are.

533
00:43:57,801 --> 00:43:59,887
I hope we can work well together again.

534
00:43:59,970 --> 00:44:02,181
Of course. That goes without saying.

535
00:44:02,264 --> 00:44:04,183
We're all on the same side.

536
00:44:05,684 --> 00:44:08,812
Should we eat what Ms. Jeong likes
for lunch today?

537
00:44:10,439 --> 00:44:12,149
She likes pork cutlet.

538
00:44:28,999 --> 00:44:31,085
I'M SORRY

539
00:44:31,168 --> 00:44:32,336
In-a.

540
00:44:32,419 --> 00:44:34,380
Thank you for your help yesterday.

541
00:44:34,463 --> 00:44:35,839
This is your reward.

542
00:44:39,009 --> 00:44:41,970
He's so considerate.

543
00:44:50,020 --> 00:44:53,148
I wasn't there for you again
when you needed me.

544
00:44:55,609 --> 00:44:57,611
It was my fault though.

545
00:44:58,112 --> 00:45:00,531
Please don't worry about it.

546
00:45:04,451 --> 00:45:06,328
Thanks to this incident,

547
00:45:06,412 --> 00:45:10,124
I realized I'm not the kind of person
who can let go of my pride or career

548
00:45:10,207 --> 00:45:12,418
to stand up for you.

549
00:45:27,433 --> 00:45:30,227
I'll stop making up for the past now.

550
00:45:38,986 --> 00:45:43,574
FROM BONG CHEOL-HUI

551
00:45:50,247 --> 00:45:53,208
Are we really going back?

552
00:45:53,292 --> 00:45:55,961
How many times must I tell you?

553
00:45:56,044 --> 00:45:58,464
Break is almost over,
so you have to go back to school.

554
00:46:00,007 --> 00:46:02,426
But I like it here.

555
00:46:02,509 --> 00:46:04,970
But I like Aunt Ha-na.

556
00:46:08,474 --> 00:46:09,766
I'm not going.

557
00:46:10,517 --> 00:46:11,852
I'm not going either!

558
00:46:11,935 --> 00:46:12,811
What?

559
00:46:12,895 --> 00:46:15,439
You shouldn't have looked so happy.

560
00:46:15,522 --> 00:46:17,316
I got excited over nothing.

561
00:46:22,404 --> 00:46:24,656
Throw this away!
Why bother taking any of this?

562
00:46:24,740 --> 00:46:27,743
Trash it. It's all useless anyway.

563
00:46:42,758 --> 00:46:44,218
Dear Ha-na.

564
00:46:45,928 --> 00:46:49,932
Everyone wants to hide their weaknesses.

565
00:46:50,807 --> 00:46:54,478
For Joo Dong-seok, it was his rage
and insecurity towards women.

566
00:46:54,561 --> 00:46:55,687
For me,

567
00:46:55,771 --> 00:47:00,317
it was the pressure of responsibility
arising from my past.

568
00:47:00,817 --> 00:47:02,569
You said I needed to be qualified.

569
00:47:03,946 --> 00:47:09,576
Then let's see if I'm qualified
to get married or not.

570
00:47:10,452 --> 00:47:14,665
I was afraid to get married
because of my weaknesses.

571
00:47:15,624 --> 00:47:18,210
That is, until I met you.

572
00:47:18,293 --> 00:47:20,087
Cheol-hui, I'm going to trust you.

573
00:47:20,170 --> 00:47:23,590
Your warm encouragement and faith

574
00:47:24,341 --> 00:47:27,261
changed the dark side in me.

575
00:47:28,720 --> 00:47:34,726
But I don't think you're aware
of these special powers you possess.

576
00:47:35,269 --> 00:47:36,937
I wanted to trust you.

577
00:47:37,020 --> 00:47:40,315
You trusted me and came to Injeong City,

578
00:47:40,399 --> 00:47:43,360
so I thought it was only fair
that I do the same for you.

579
00:47:43,944 --> 00:47:46,363
Thank you for believing in me.

580
00:47:48,574 --> 00:47:50,659
I hope you'll no longer feel uncomfortable

581
00:47:50,742 --> 00:47:53,996
because of my feelings for you.

582
00:47:59,251 --> 00:48:03,547
So regarding
the Marriage Morale Boost project,

583
00:48:04,256 --> 00:48:05,591
I'm dropping out of it.

584
00:48:15,350 --> 00:48:19,438
Thank you so much
for shining a light on my life.

585
00:48:45,505 --> 00:48:49,259
Sharing a burden
doesn't lessen it by half.

586
00:48:52,054 --> 00:48:55,849
Sharing your sadness
doesn't lessen it by half.

587
00:48:57,976 --> 00:48:59,019
However,

588
00:49:00,187 --> 00:49:03,065
I realized that having someone
by your side

589
00:49:03,148 --> 00:49:05,776
is enough to give you
the strength to carry on.

590
00:49:24,920 --> 00:49:27,631
CHEOL-HUI

591
00:49:27,714 --> 00:49:28,924
MOM

592
00:49:32,177 --> 00:49:33,387
MOM

593
00:49:35,889 --> 00:49:36,848
Ha-na.

594
00:49:36,932 --> 00:49:39,226
Mom, why are you calling at this hour?

595
00:49:39,309 --> 00:49:40,769
Just because.

596
00:49:40,852 --> 00:49:42,396
Have you eaten yet?

597
00:49:42,479 --> 00:49:44,523
Did you see the side dishes I made you?

598
00:49:45,774 --> 00:49:48,068
Why did you make so much?

599
00:49:48,694 --> 00:49:51,613
Because I want you to eat well
and get some energy.

600
00:49:51,697 --> 00:49:55,867
Make sure not to skip any meals, okay?

601
00:49:55,951 --> 00:49:58,745
I might not be able
to take care of you much longer.

602
00:50:01,331 --> 00:50:02,332
What?

603
00:50:04,042 --> 00:50:05,627
What do you mean?

604
00:50:05,711 --> 00:50:07,629
Something's wrong, isn't it?

605
00:50:07,713 --> 00:50:09,589
It's nothing much.

606
00:50:10,298 --> 00:50:12,342
I'm at the hospital right now.

607
00:50:12,426 --> 00:50:15,262
What? Why are you at the hospital?

608
00:50:16,930 --> 00:50:18,974
It's not serious, but…

609
00:50:22,102 --> 00:50:25,689
If it's not serious, then what is it?

610
00:50:29,526 --> 00:50:31,695
I might have stomach cancer.

611
00:50:32,446 --> 00:50:33,864
Mom, where are you?

612
00:50:35,782 --> 00:50:37,242
At the hospital.

613
00:50:38,493 --> 00:50:40,370
I was admitted yesterday.

614
00:50:42,456 --> 00:50:44,541
Why are you only telling me this now?

615
00:50:47,169 --> 00:50:49,504
Which hospital is it? I'm on my way.

616
00:51:04,603 --> 00:51:07,063
Is Aunt Ha-na not coming to say goodbye?

617
00:51:09,441 --> 00:51:13,153
Uncle, did you really tell her
that we're leaving?

618
00:51:14,863 --> 00:51:17,324
The thing is…

619
00:51:17,407 --> 00:51:20,619
Did Aunt Ha-na say
she'll meet us there? Is that it?

620
00:51:22,662 --> 00:51:24,206
No, that's not it.

621
00:51:25,081 --> 00:51:27,000
Read the room already.

622
00:51:27,083 --> 00:51:28,460
What did I do?

623
00:51:30,128 --> 00:51:31,254
What are you doing?

624
00:51:31,338 --> 00:51:32,714
I'm calling her.

625
00:51:33,298 --> 00:51:34,883
Are you sure it's a good idea?

626
00:51:34,966 --> 00:51:36,218
Yes.

627
00:51:36,301 --> 00:51:37,552
HA-NA

628
00:51:37,636 --> 00:51:39,054
Don't do it.

629
00:51:39,137 --> 00:51:40,347
Take it.

630
00:51:40,430 --> 00:51:41,431
Take what?

631
00:51:42,933 --> 00:51:44,684
Wait, what did you do?

632
00:51:50,315 --> 00:51:51,483
Ha-na?

633
00:51:52,359 --> 00:51:53,902
Cheol-hui…

634
00:52:45,787 --> 00:52:48,832
HORIM UNIVERSITY HOSPITAL

635
00:52:54,379 --> 00:52:59,593
It's such a relief to hear
that it's not cancer.

636
00:53:01,553 --> 00:53:06,266
Did you know that my stomach dropped
when I talked to you on the phone?

637
00:53:06,933 --> 00:53:08,727
It almost fell out.

638
00:53:12,105 --> 00:53:16,067
Let me know
if you want to borrow my stomach,

639
00:53:16,151 --> 00:53:17,944
since mine is pretty healthy.

640
00:53:27,746 --> 00:53:28,747
Ha-na.

641
00:53:30,665 --> 00:53:33,043
What do you call a shrimp
that won't share?

642
00:53:33,752 --> 00:53:34,920
What?

643
00:53:35,003 --> 00:53:38,298
Shellfish.

644
00:53:39,925 --> 00:53:42,469
Then what about…

645
00:53:44,596 --> 00:53:47,182
What did the dog say
when it sat on sandpaper?

646
00:53:48,516 --> 00:53:50,810
Rough! Rough!

647
00:53:52,354 --> 00:53:55,231
What do you call a dragon who can juggle?

648
00:53:56,274 --> 00:53:57,275
What?

649
00:53:58,109 --> 00:53:59,361
"Talon-ted."

650
00:54:06,534 --> 00:54:08,161
I'm okay now.

651
00:54:11,039 --> 00:54:15,335
I'll tell you funnier jokes next time.

652
00:54:15,418 --> 00:54:18,505
The twins get a kick out of them though.

653
00:54:24,302 --> 00:54:26,888
It's because I feel guilty about this.

654
00:54:28,890 --> 00:54:30,934
What is there to feel guilty about?

655
00:54:32,185 --> 00:54:33,812
It's enough for me

656
00:54:33,895 --> 00:54:36,314
to be by your side
when you're having a hard time.

657
00:54:40,402 --> 00:54:42,320
But what if I can't do the same?

658
00:54:45,949 --> 00:54:47,867
That's okay.

659
00:54:49,160 --> 00:54:52,247
It's harder for me
not knowing when you're sad.

660
00:54:53,123 --> 00:54:55,333
Can I manage to live

661
00:54:56,543 --> 00:54:58,753
in this world alone?

662
00:55:00,046 --> 00:55:02,340
Why were you going to leave
without saying goodbye?

663
00:55:06,678 --> 00:55:09,055
Because that would've
really meant the end.

664
00:55:17,605 --> 00:55:18,440
Cheol-hui.

665
00:55:18,523 --> 00:55:19,774
Yes?

666
00:55:22,485 --> 00:55:25,030
It might be a mistake to say this…

667
00:55:28,491 --> 00:55:30,577
But I don't want a life without you.

668
00:55:32,454 --> 00:55:33,496
What?

669
00:55:37,625 --> 00:55:39,377
I'm telling you that I like you.

670
00:56:06,071 --> 00:56:07,238
Dad.

671
00:56:08,073 --> 00:56:09,365
Dad?

672
00:56:17,791 --> 00:56:18,625
All right.

673
00:56:21,336 --> 00:56:22,629
I approve.

674
00:56:27,008 --> 00:56:29,052
Thank you, sir.

675
00:56:29,135 --> 00:56:32,013
You seem very reliable. I like that.

676
00:56:41,981 --> 00:56:44,400
As we continue to go through life,

677
00:56:44,484 --> 00:56:47,612
we'll likely encounter
even more unpredictable things than this.

678
00:56:48,655 --> 00:56:52,534
To have someone on my side
during those times is

679
00:56:54,160 --> 00:56:56,412
something to be grateful for.

680
00:57:17,183 --> 00:57:18,768
What about the wedding invitations?

681
00:57:18,852 --> 00:57:20,311
Are you curious?

682
00:57:20,395 --> 00:57:23,022
Did you increase
the font size like I told you?

683
00:57:24,274 --> 00:57:26,693
Yes. Older guests can read it easily.

684
00:57:31,906 --> 00:57:33,450
BAE HAN-SU
OH IN-A

685
00:57:33,533 --> 00:57:36,161
Good job.

686
00:57:36,244 --> 00:57:37,954
Just as I thought.

687
00:57:39,289 --> 00:57:41,040
Someone with experience always helps.

688
00:57:43,918 --> 00:57:47,005
I thought you said
you'd never let your father set you up.

689
00:57:49,299 --> 00:57:52,552
I thought about it and realized
that marriage is about reality.

690
00:57:54,220 --> 00:57:57,849
I figured it'd be easier
to live with someone

691
00:57:57,932 --> 00:58:01,144
with a similar background,
who shares similar values,

692
00:58:01,227 --> 00:58:03,396
and respects my likes and dislikes.

693
00:58:03,980 --> 00:58:05,690
What about realizing your dream?

694
00:58:06,274 --> 00:58:07,775
You've grown up since then.

695
00:58:08,610 --> 00:58:09,944
In any case, congratulations.

696
00:58:12,113 --> 00:58:13,406
What about you?

697
00:58:13,490 --> 00:58:14,657
Me?

698
00:58:17,619 --> 00:58:21,080
I'm not getting married.

699
00:58:22,874 --> 00:58:24,000
Seriously?

700
00:58:24,584 --> 00:58:28,213
I was too focused
on making up for the past.

701
00:58:28,838 --> 00:58:31,841
Now that I don't have
a goal anymore, I feel empty.

702
00:58:31,925 --> 00:58:33,801
And I don't know who I am.

703
00:58:37,013 --> 00:58:40,808
Have some fun on your own
and let me know if you get bored.

704
00:58:40,892 --> 00:58:42,644
Why? Will you hang out with me?

705
00:58:42,727 --> 00:58:45,063
Yes, but only if
my husband says it's okay.

706
00:58:45,772 --> 00:58:47,023
Forget it.

707
00:58:49,150 --> 00:58:51,236
Right, who's singing at the wedding?

708
00:58:57,659 --> 00:58:58,701
Jeong Ha-na.

709
00:59:14,551 --> 00:59:19,347
The future I had dreamed of
was surprisingly closer than I'd thought.

710
00:59:19,430 --> 00:59:24,769
For every moment
That we walk alongside each other

711
00:59:24,852 --> 00:59:29,524
I hope that we'll shine brightly

712
00:59:29,607 --> 00:59:34,862
All the time we spent
Overcoming hardships

713
00:59:34,946 --> 00:59:37,949
I hope it will someday
Shine down on us

714
00:59:38,032 --> 00:59:39,075
Ha-na.

715
00:59:39,659 --> 00:59:41,494
Aren't you going to pack?

716
00:59:41,578 --> 00:59:43,830
- Hey, that's mine.
- It's Mask Man!

717
00:59:43,913 --> 00:59:48,126
I'm starting to notice
the crow's feet around my eyes.

718
00:59:48,209 --> 00:59:51,337
I need to take care of my face
if I want to keep up with you.

719
00:59:51,421 --> 00:59:52,922
I don't have time for much else.

720
00:59:55,216 --> 00:59:57,594
Uncle, I want to try it on.

721
00:59:57,677 --> 01:00:00,054
I want to get popular too.

722
01:00:00,555 --> 01:00:01,848
Okay.

723
01:00:03,099 --> 01:00:04,392
I hope you get popular.

724
01:00:07,562 --> 01:00:09,355
Hey, what's going on?

725
01:00:09,439 --> 01:00:11,232
It hurts my eyes.

726
01:00:12,400 --> 01:00:15,486
- Here. Go and get popular.
- Thank you.

727
01:00:15,570 --> 01:00:17,614
No, me first!

728
01:00:17,697 --> 01:00:19,240
But I'm older than you!

729
01:00:19,324 --> 01:00:21,993
Ha-na, you should get going now.

730
01:00:22,076 --> 01:00:23,745
Or else you'll settle down here.

731
01:00:26,331 --> 01:00:27,540
But I don't want to go.

732
01:00:38,176 --> 01:00:41,387
There are still many things I want to do.

733
01:00:44,557 --> 01:00:46,601
But if we continue to walk together…

734
01:00:49,854 --> 01:00:52,982
I believe we'll reach our goals
before we know it.

735
01:01:12,126 --> 01:01:14,587
It's time to celebrate!

736
01:01:15,171 --> 01:01:18,132
Look, they're even wearing matching shoes.

737
01:01:18,216 --> 01:01:19,801
What a great time to be in love.

738
01:01:22,970 --> 01:01:26,182
You should get your wife
something like that too!

739
01:01:26,265 --> 01:01:27,684
No, thanks!

740
01:01:27,767 --> 01:01:29,268
Hush!

741
01:01:29,894 --> 01:01:31,604
Please be quiet.

742
01:01:31,688 --> 01:01:35,108
They're happy right now.
Let's give them some privacy.

743
01:01:35,191 --> 01:01:36,693
You understand, right?

744
01:01:42,699 --> 01:01:44,033
Uncle!

745
01:01:44,992 --> 01:01:46,244
Auntie!

746
01:01:54,293 --> 01:01:57,630
I don't think married life
will always be happy.

747
01:01:59,465 --> 01:02:03,803
But right now,
with so many people on my side,

748
01:02:03,886 --> 01:02:05,388
I'm happy.

749
01:02:08,182 --> 01:02:11,352
So what's your baby's nickname?

750
01:02:11,978 --> 01:02:13,146
It's One Time.

751
01:02:13,229 --> 01:02:16,274
It's because we only did it
one time and got pregnant.

752
01:02:16,357 --> 01:02:18,651
Where's Mr. Choi?

753
01:02:18,735 --> 01:02:21,070
Someone got hired
as a special civil servant,

754
01:02:21,154 --> 01:02:22,363
so he went to get them.

755
01:02:24,866 --> 01:02:27,160
I wonder who it could be?

756
01:02:27,744 --> 01:02:30,079
Lucky you, Mr. Han.

757
01:02:31,038 --> 01:02:32,123
Hello, Mr. Choi.

758
01:02:33,124 --> 01:02:34,208
Come on in.

759
01:02:40,506 --> 01:02:41,799
Hello.

760
01:02:41,883 --> 01:02:44,135
Is that Mr. Bong Cheol-hui?

761
01:02:45,928 --> 01:02:49,307
Starting today, Mr. Bong will join
the Marriage Morale Boost Team.

762
01:02:49,390 --> 01:02:51,768
I'll skip the introductions
since you know each other.

763
01:02:51,851 --> 01:02:53,644
What's that in your hand?

764
01:02:53,728 --> 01:02:56,898
Oh, it's not much.

765
01:02:56,981 --> 01:02:59,942
I got something for Ms. Lee
to congratulate her

766
01:03:00,026 --> 01:03:01,569
on her second pregnancy.

767
01:03:02,820 --> 01:03:04,572
Goodness, this is for me?

768
01:03:04,655 --> 01:03:07,575
I can't believe this. Thank you so much.

769
01:03:07,658 --> 01:03:08,659
Hold on.

770
01:03:09,577 --> 01:03:13,456
This feels really light.

771
01:03:13,539 --> 01:03:15,374
Open it.

772
01:03:15,458 --> 01:03:17,794
Those are very light shoes

773
01:03:17,877 --> 01:03:19,670
that are perfect for pregnant women.

774
01:03:19,754 --> 01:03:21,464
Oh, shoes?

775
01:03:21,547 --> 01:03:24,258
My goodness, are you serious?

776
01:03:25,343 --> 01:03:28,805
Look at them. They match my outfit!

777
01:03:30,264 --> 01:03:31,641
Try them on.

778
01:03:31,724 --> 01:03:34,727
I can't even tell that I'm wearing shoes.

779
01:03:35,603 --> 01:03:38,397
They're so light and comfortable!

780
01:03:38,481 --> 01:03:39,607
Hold on!

781
01:03:39,690 --> 01:03:41,317
Hello, sir.

782
01:03:43,110 --> 01:03:45,321
I arrived just at the right time again.

783
01:03:46,948 --> 01:03:51,160
Let's start with this person
as our first new project.

784
01:03:59,168 --> 01:04:00,336
This person, sir?

785
01:04:05,299 --> 01:04:06,467
But, sir…

786
01:04:08,469 --> 01:04:10,680
Doesn't this person look familiar?

787
01:04:10,763 --> 01:04:12,723
Is it my turn to step up now?

788
01:04:12,807 --> 01:04:14,308
Sir, I'll take--

789
01:04:14,392 --> 01:04:18,020
How about if Mr. Bong
takes charge of this case?

790
01:04:18,104 --> 01:04:19,105
What?

791
01:04:20,940 --> 01:04:22,066
Me?

792
01:04:22,149 --> 01:04:24,819
I'm counting on you, Mr. Bong.

793
01:04:25,862 --> 01:04:27,905
I don't have anything special in mind.

794
01:04:27,989 --> 01:04:30,241
If I think they're a good match,

795
01:04:30,324 --> 01:04:32,577
I'll sit them down
and tell them one thing.

796
01:04:34,120 --> 01:04:35,580
Get married.

797
01:04:37,456 --> 01:04:39,375
Is this over now?

798
01:04:39,458 --> 01:04:41,586
It feels like something is missing.

799
01:04:41,669 --> 01:04:43,921
It made me realize

800
01:04:44,005 --> 01:04:46,883
that you need to be
qualified to get married.

801
01:04:46,966 --> 01:04:48,926
So am I going to give up?

802
01:04:49,427 --> 01:04:51,178
No.

803
01:04:51,262 --> 01:04:54,223
I think this time will be better

804
01:04:54,307 --> 01:04:58,185
because I found out
how to give love to the fullest.

805
01:04:59,228 --> 01:05:00,229
Is it my turn now?

806
01:05:00,313 --> 01:05:03,900
Ha-na, come quickly! I'm up next.

807
01:05:04,901 --> 01:05:06,277
Hello.

808
01:05:06,360 --> 01:05:08,446
My name is Bong Cheol-hui.

809
01:05:08,529 --> 01:05:10,698
THE TWO OF US CAN LIVE
HAPPILY TOGETHER

810
01:05:10,781 --> 01:05:12,992
What do you think
are the advantages of marriage?

811
01:05:14,285 --> 01:05:15,661
Look.

812
01:05:16,329 --> 01:05:18,831
There isn't any advantage in a marriage!

813
01:05:18,915 --> 01:05:21,250
It just means more responsibility.

814
01:05:21,334 --> 01:05:23,961
It's easier to live alone,
don't you think?

815
01:05:24,879 --> 01:05:26,005
But…

816
01:05:28,257 --> 01:05:29,842
I'm planning on getting married.

817
01:05:32,803 --> 01:05:33,846
Ha-na.

818
01:05:37,600 --> 01:05:40,561
Will you marry me?

819
01:05:44,231 --> 01:05:45,983
- Cheol-hui.
- Yes?

820
01:05:48,736 --> 01:05:50,071
I love you.

821
01:05:50,154 --> 01:05:51,489
Love?

822
01:06:01,207 --> 01:06:02,208
Ha-na.

823
01:06:03,292 --> 01:06:04,543
Yes?

824
01:06:08,130 --> 01:06:08,965
I love you.

825
01:06:13,427 --> 01:06:16,055
Wait, it's not over yet!

826
01:06:16,847 --> 01:06:19,934
I went absolutely crazy
over her profile picture.

827
01:06:20,017 --> 01:06:21,936
He really hit on me.

828
01:06:23,187 --> 01:06:26,023
We were college sweethearts.

829
01:06:26,107 --> 01:06:27,191
And because

830
01:06:27,274 --> 01:06:28,859
she was pretty.

831
01:06:29,652 --> 01:06:34,490
The moment I saw him,
I had a feeling I was going to marry him.

832
01:06:34,573 --> 01:06:37,368
I think that's why
I opened up to him naturally.

833
01:06:37,451 --> 01:06:39,245
How many years has it been?

834
01:06:39,328 --> 01:06:42,164
It's been 33 years.

835
01:06:42,248 --> 01:06:43,624
Oh, 33 years?

836
01:06:44,542 --> 01:06:47,086
I don't think his looks were a factor.

837
01:06:47,169 --> 01:06:49,588
You should talk about
how smart I was and such.

838
01:06:49,672 --> 01:06:51,007
That's right.

839
01:06:51,090 --> 01:06:53,509
I thought she was my type of woman.

840
01:06:54,677 --> 01:06:57,430
Oh, and she was pretty.

841
01:06:57,513 --> 01:06:59,098
Too late.

842
01:06:59,974 --> 01:07:02,101
I had a rough time with her

843
01:07:02,184 --> 01:07:04,437
because she couldn't forget about her ex.

844
01:07:04,520 --> 01:07:09,567
We tried our best to remain platonic.

845
01:07:09,650 --> 01:07:12,194
But then I realized
I couldn't live without her.

846
01:07:12,278 --> 01:07:14,030
I was sure of it.

847
01:07:14,113 --> 01:07:15,489
So one day, after drinking…

848
01:07:15,573 --> 01:07:18,951
He said, "If you say yes,
then it's yes forever.

849
01:07:19,035 --> 01:07:21,328
But if you say no, it'll be no forever."

850
01:07:21,412 --> 01:07:25,374
Then he said he wanted
a straight answer immediately.

851
01:07:25,458 --> 01:07:28,961
After living together for a while,

852
01:07:29,045 --> 01:07:32,381
I noticed things
that I missed when we were dating.

853
01:07:32,465 --> 01:07:34,300
You know what I'm talking about, right?

854
01:07:34,383 --> 01:07:38,345
You experience different degrees of love.

855
01:07:38,429 --> 01:07:41,974
When you first start dating, it's hot.

856
01:07:42,058 --> 01:07:45,102
But after you get married,
you're too busy making a living, so…

857
01:07:45,186 --> 01:07:47,438
To be honest, compared to the past,

858
01:07:47,521 --> 01:07:49,523
I think I walk on eggshells more.

859
01:07:49,607 --> 01:07:51,150
We fought a lot.

860
01:07:51,233 --> 01:07:53,027
- Like, a ton.
- We let it all out.

861
01:07:53,110 --> 01:07:56,822
What's important is
how you make up after a fight.

862
01:07:56,906 --> 01:07:58,949
We might fight tooth and nail,

863
01:07:59,033 --> 01:08:02,161
but we've never slept in separate rooms.

864
01:08:02,244 --> 01:08:04,747
We always make up within a day.

865
01:08:04,830 --> 01:08:06,373
It's as if

866
01:08:06,457 --> 01:08:09,335
a rough boulder meets a skilled mason

867
01:08:09,418 --> 01:08:11,170
and becomes an elaborate Buddha statue.

868
01:08:11,253 --> 01:08:14,840
To be honest,
married life can't always be good.

869
01:08:14,924 --> 01:08:16,509
Being a family

870
01:08:16,592 --> 01:08:20,471
and the happiness you get from that
is beyond what you can imagine.

871
01:08:20,554 --> 01:08:23,516
Having our children was
the happiest time, right?

872
01:08:23,599 --> 01:08:24,433
Right.

873
01:08:24,517 --> 01:08:29,855
This joy is something
you can't describe in words.

874
01:08:29,939 --> 01:08:31,440
I just got goose bumps.

875
01:08:31,524 --> 01:08:34,443
I think life is much better right now.

876
01:08:34,527 --> 01:08:38,906
I'm learning what true happiness
and thankfulness means.

877
01:08:38,989 --> 01:08:42,576
I feel reassured in a way
when we eat and watch TV together

878
01:08:42,660 --> 01:08:47,373
and knowing that he's waiting for me
at home when I get off work.

879
01:08:47,456 --> 01:08:50,668
We're both struggling.

880
01:08:50,751 --> 01:08:54,755
We have no money,
and our future isn't certain.

881
01:08:54,839 --> 01:08:59,343
I'm not sure if I agree with the idea
of everyone having to get married,

882
01:08:59,426 --> 01:09:02,304
so I've been against getting married.

883
01:09:02,388 --> 01:09:04,849
When I go to my friends' weddings,

884
01:09:04,932 --> 01:09:06,308
I find myself tearing up.

885
01:09:06,392 --> 01:09:09,603
I don't know. It makes me feel strange.

886
01:09:09,687 --> 01:09:14,441
This is somebody
you have to live with for decades.

887
01:09:14,525 --> 01:09:18,154
I think a certain amount of money
is needed for marriage.

888
01:09:18,237 --> 01:09:20,197
For couples with a lot of money,

889
01:09:20,281 --> 01:09:22,283
I think about 60 percent
or more seem happy.

890
01:09:22,366 --> 01:09:24,577
This is why money is
the most important factor.

891
01:09:24,660 --> 01:09:27,204
Marriage?

892
01:09:27,288 --> 01:09:30,291
I think it's best
to get married if possible.

893
01:09:30,374 --> 01:09:32,960
But why is it a good idea?

894
01:09:33,043 --> 01:09:37,548
I'm always thankful that he's on my side.

895
01:09:39,800 --> 01:09:42,553
He believes in me
more than I believe in myself.

896
01:09:42,636 --> 01:09:46,307
That's why I can lean on him.

897
01:09:46,390 --> 01:09:51,729
I love watching
young couples pushing strollers.

898
01:09:51,812 --> 01:09:53,898
It's a beautiful sight.

899
01:09:53,981 --> 01:09:57,651
We matured more after having our baby.

900
01:09:57,735 --> 01:10:00,237
And you make more money.

901
01:10:00,321 --> 01:10:02,406
You can't save money on your own.

902
01:10:02,489 --> 01:10:04,700
But after you get married, it happens.

903
01:10:04,783 --> 01:10:09,330
My husband is changing
a lot as he gets older.

904
01:10:09,413 --> 01:10:13,918
It's why I'm enjoying
the happiest days of my life.

905
01:10:14,001 --> 01:10:16,962
Please give me a little more time.

906
01:10:17,046 --> 01:10:19,256
I promise to show you what I can do.

907
01:10:19,340 --> 01:10:21,091
I just nod and pretend to believe him.

908
01:10:21,175 --> 01:10:25,262
I just want to say sorry and thank you.

909
01:10:28,432 --> 01:10:33,020
I'm the one who wanted to get married,
but now I can't think of anything.

910
01:10:33,103 --> 01:10:35,981
All you need is your husband, right?

911
01:10:36,065 --> 01:10:38,192
Marriage is a necessity.

912
01:10:39,652 --> 01:10:42,071
I'm thinking about it.

913
01:10:44,073 --> 01:10:45,741
I love you.

914
01:10:48,577 --> 01:10:50,454
Let's live together for a long time.

915
01:10:50,537 --> 01:10:52,998
Okay. I love you.

916
01:10:54,708 --> 01:10:56,085
Did you think we were done?

917
01:10:57,711 --> 01:10:58,921
It's not over yet.

918
01:10:59,004 --> 01:11:00,381
THANK YOU FOR WATCHING OUR SHOW

919
01:11:00,464 --> 01:11:02,091
PLEASE STAY TUNED
FOR THE BLOOPER REEL

920
01:11:30,035 --> 01:11:31,704
You don't have to worry about me.

921
01:11:31,787 --> 01:11:33,038
CHEOL-HUI IS SAD

922
01:11:33,122 --> 01:11:34,373
I'm sorry.

923
01:11:35,207 --> 01:11:37,710
WE PREPARED A LITTLE SOMETHING

924
01:11:37,793 --> 01:11:38,877
PEEKABOO

925
01:11:38,961 --> 01:11:40,671
IT'S BLOOPER REEL TIME!

926
01:11:40,754 --> 01:11:44,133
What type of house
does the number five hate the most?

927
01:11:44,216 --> 01:11:45,634
Opera House.

928
01:11:45,718 --> 01:11:47,052
HA-HA

929
01:11:47,136 --> 01:11:49,096
What does a dragon have on its floors?

930
01:11:49,179 --> 01:11:50,347
WHAT?

931
01:11:50,431 --> 01:11:52,766
Rep-tiles!

932
01:11:52,850 --> 01:11:55,185
What did the cat say
after making a bad joke?

933
01:11:55,269 --> 01:11:56,895
GETTING READY

934
01:11:56,979 --> 01:11:58,480
Just kitten!

935
01:11:58,564 --> 01:12:00,774
What do you say to a naughty cat?

936
01:12:00,858 --> 01:12:02,109
GULP

937
01:12:02,192 --> 01:12:05,154
Stop stressing "meowt"!

938
01:12:05,237 --> 01:12:06,280
What?

939
01:12:06,864 --> 01:12:08,657
I'm okay now.

940
01:12:08,741 --> 01:12:09,783
Cut.

941
01:12:10,534 --> 01:12:12,494
I'm on your side.

942
01:12:12,578 --> 01:12:13,829
Thank you.

943
01:12:14,538 --> 01:12:16,332
Then lend me 30 million won.

944
01:12:17,249 --> 01:12:18,709
I won't eat it!

945
01:12:18,792 --> 01:12:20,252
- Eat it.
- Give it to me then.

946
01:12:20,336 --> 01:12:21,420
No!

947
01:12:22,880 --> 01:12:24,673
Ba-da, what's that?

948
01:12:24,757 --> 01:12:27,217
Uncle, haven't you heard of Cupid?

949
01:12:27,301 --> 01:12:28,761
You shoot…

950
01:12:28,844 --> 01:12:30,512
You're way too excited to shoot me.

951
01:12:31,096 --> 01:12:32,556
Heave-ho!

952
01:12:32,639 --> 01:12:34,016
WE'VE BEEN WORKING HARD

953
01:12:34,099 --> 01:12:35,517
Cut!

954
01:12:35,601 --> 01:12:36,852
Thank you.

955
01:12:37,895 --> 01:12:39,688
A scolding…

956
01:12:40,481 --> 01:12:41,857
WE CAN'T END THINGS HERE, SO…

957
01:12:41,940 --> 01:12:42,775
SMOOCH

958
01:12:42,858 --> 01:12:46,278
This drama was
very warm, healing, and sweet.

959
01:12:46,362 --> 01:12:48,322
Thankfully, we wrapped things up well.

960
01:12:48,405 --> 01:12:52,451
I hope I'll get to work
with this cast again.

961
01:12:52,534 --> 01:12:54,745
Thank you so much
for watching our show until the end.

962
01:12:54,828 --> 01:12:59,833
