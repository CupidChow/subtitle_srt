FILMING OF CHILD ACTORS DONE
UNDER BROADCASTING GUIDELINES

3
00:00:42,125 --> 00:00:44,335
Can you two clink glasses?

4
00:00:44,419 --> 00:00:45,962
- Clink glasses?
- Yes.

5
00:00:46,045 --> 00:00:47,630
- Cheers.
- It has to be visible.

6
00:00:47,714 --> 00:00:49,424
- Is this good? Cheers.
- Okay.

7
00:00:56,556 --> 00:00:58,099
Can you do it one more time?

8
00:00:59,184 --> 00:01:00,727
- It's for the shoot.
- Yes.

9
00:01:01,978 --> 00:01:03,354
Cheol-hui, have another shot.

10
00:01:08,943 --> 00:01:12,155
In-a, give me that. I'll drink it.

11
00:01:22,999 --> 00:01:24,292
Wow.

12
00:01:36,679 --> 00:01:37,889
Cheers.

13
00:01:39,641 --> 00:01:43,019
If we drink this,
we'll officially start dating.

14
00:01:43,102 --> 00:01:45,939
We'll officially be a couple.

15
00:01:46,022 --> 00:01:48,608
It's cemented. You can't go back on it.

16
00:01:49,567 --> 00:01:51,986
Bang bang ding dong.

17
00:01:52,070 --> 00:01:53,321
Bottoms up.

18
00:01:55,907 --> 00:01:58,118
Let me switch the battery.

19
00:01:58,201 --> 00:01:59,369
- I need a fresh one.
- Okay.

20
00:02:10,255 --> 00:02:11,256
Excuse me.

21
00:02:21,558 --> 00:02:23,059
- Mr. Bong Cheol-hui?
- Yes?

22
00:02:25,562 --> 00:02:26,938
I'm against this match.

23
00:02:31,442 --> 00:02:33,319
I can't send you off to her.

24
00:02:35,989 --> 00:02:37,907
Ha-na, what's wrong?

25
00:02:40,160 --> 00:02:41,452
Ha-na?

26
00:02:53,840 --> 00:02:55,633
1 UNREAD MESSAGE

27
00:02:55,717 --> 00:02:59,178
A woman showed up at the airport,
so I couldn't send off the kids.

28
00:02:59,262 --> 00:03:01,055
I'll try again next time.

29
00:03:04,350 --> 00:03:05,852
This isn't what you promised.

30
00:03:07,437 --> 00:03:08,855
What is this about?

31
00:03:12,191 --> 00:03:14,152
Ask In-a to explain.

32
00:03:17,655 --> 00:03:18,656
Goodness!

33
00:03:20,909 --> 00:03:22,744
Explain properly. What are you doing?

34
00:03:23,912 --> 00:03:25,330
Didn't you hear me?

35
00:03:25,830 --> 00:03:27,624
I'm against this match.

36
00:03:28,499 --> 00:03:30,335
I can't let Cheol-hui go like this.

37
00:03:30,418 --> 00:03:32,295
So why?

38
00:03:32,378 --> 00:03:35,173
Because Ms. Oh In-a doesn't deserve him.

39
00:03:47,769 --> 00:03:49,395
Do you see what's going on here?

40
00:03:53,816 --> 00:03:57,195
You're the one who set up this match.

41
00:03:58,279 --> 00:04:00,490
But you're the one who's ruining it.

42
00:04:02,075 --> 00:04:05,203
Are civil servants allowed
to do this to citizens?

43
00:04:06,579 --> 00:04:09,707
You of all people know why I'm doing this.

44
00:04:15,004 --> 00:04:16,381
Let's go, Cheol-hui.

45
00:04:18,091 --> 00:04:21,344
Get up.

46
00:04:27,308 --> 00:04:29,727
Ba-da and San-i are waiting at home,

47
00:04:29,811 --> 00:04:31,229
so I have to go.

48
00:05:13,021 --> 00:05:14,272
Are you awake, San-i?

49
00:05:15,648 --> 00:05:19,777
Don't tell Uncle Cheol-hui.

50
00:05:21,446 --> 00:05:24,115
If he finds out our dad was here,

51
00:05:25,658 --> 00:05:27,410
it'll make him sad.

52
00:05:38,004 --> 00:05:39,839
Promise me, okay?

53
00:05:40,882 --> 00:05:44,093
If you don't, you'll grow hair everywhere.

54
00:05:53,061 --> 00:05:56,522
I'M TAKING THE KIDS, SO LIVE
YOUR OWN LIFE - YOUR BROTHER

55
00:05:58,524 --> 00:06:00,234
Marriage is different than dating.

56
00:06:01,611 --> 00:06:05,615
When you get married,
you become husband and wife.

57
00:06:05,698 --> 00:06:08,826
You have kids and become a family.

58
00:06:09,869 --> 00:06:14,040
Then those kids grow up and get married

59
00:06:15,083 --> 00:06:16,959
and form their own families.

60
00:06:18,044 --> 00:06:23,299
Just because two people want this
doesn't mean it can happen,

61
00:06:23,382 --> 00:06:24,801
so it's hard.

62
00:06:36,562 --> 00:06:38,231
- Uncle.
- Uncle.

63
00:06:50,576 --> 00:06:51,619
Did you sleep well?

64
00:06:51,702 --> 00:06:54,789
- Uncle.
- Why did you get home so late?

65
00:06:54,872 --> 00:06:55,998
I'm sorry.

66
00:06:56,082 --> 00:06:58,000
When did you get in?

67
00:06:59,460 --> 00:07:01,504
Adults do this sometimes.

68
00:07:04,757 --> 00:07:06,092
What in the world?

69
00:07:07,635 --> 00:07:09,053
Who could it be? Come here.

70
00:07:10,012 --> 00:07:11,055
Who is it?

71
00:07:20,523 --> 00:07:21,732
- It's Ha-na!
- It's Ha-na!

72
00:07:21,816 --> 00:07:22,650
Ha-na?

73
00:07:23,651 --> 00:07:24,944
Morning delivery, sir.

74
00:07:26,863 --> 00:07:28,656
- Let me down.
- Okay.

75
00:07:31,367 --> 00:07:34,120
- What's that?
- What is it?

76
00:07:34,203 --> 00:07:36,914
- What did you bring?
- Is it a present?

77
00:07:36,998 --> 00:07:38,249
It's breakfast.

78
00:07:40,126 --> 00:07:42,336
What brings you here this morning?

79
00:07:42,420 --> 00:07:44,922
- I wanted to eat breakfast together.
- That looks good.

80
00:07:47,091 --> 00:07:49,343
- It looks delicious, right?
- Yes.

81
00:07:58,686 --> 00:08:02,690
Sitting here together makes it feel
like we're a family, right?

82
00:08:02,773 --> 00:08:03,900
Yes.

83
00:08:09,113 --> 00:08:11,908
By the way,
did something happen last night?

84
00:08:13,284 --> 00:08:16,996
I feel sore all over,
but I don't know why.

85
00:08:19,999 --> 00:08:21,125
No, not really.

86
00:08:22,418 --> 00:08:27,173
I thought something big happened
because you brought breakfast.

87
00:08:29,550 --> 00:08:31,344
What do you remember?

88
00:08:31,427 --> 00:08:32,261
What?

89
00:08:34,805 --> 00:08:35,848
Oh.

90
00:08:38,309 --> 00:08:40,186
How did I get home?

91
00:08:42,146 --> 00:08:43,606
I used my superpower.

92
00:08:46,317 --> 00:08:48,528
I mean,

93
00:08:48,611 --> 00:08:53,115
we were drinking in front of a camera,
so I couldn't say no.

94
00:08:53,199 --> 00:08:57,161
It had been a while since I drank,
and it hit me hard.

95
00:08:57,245 --> 00:08:58,871
Jeez, I feel awful.

96
00:09:00,414 --> 00:09:02,833
Hey, when did you put all that there?

97
00:09:06,712 --> 00:09:08,756
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

98
00:09:26,607 --> 00:09:27,650
- So…
- So…

99
00:09:29,694 --> 00:09:31,112
You go first, Ha-na.

100
00:09:31,195 --> 00:09:33,155
Go ahead, Cheol-hui.

101
00:09:36,242 --> 00:09:37,493
Thank you.

102
00:09:38,911 --> 00:09:40,037
For what?

103
00:09:41,038 --> 00:09:44,542
For putting me and the twins to bed.

104
00:09:47,753 --> 00:09:49,839
I'm glad you don't remember everything.

105
00:09:51,882 --> 00:09:54,051
Why? Did I slip up badly?

106
00:09:55,803 --> 00:09:57,305
No, not you.

107
00:09:58,097 --> 00:09:59,056
What?

108
00:10:01,767 --> 00:10:03,894
Will you bring me a boxed lunch later?

109
00:10:05,563 --> 00:10:07,982
Okay. Sure thing.

110
00:10:08,065 --> 00:10:09,900
- Promise me, okay?
- Okay.

111
00:10:09,984 --> 00:10:11,193
See you.

112
00:10:27,710 --> 00:10:28,961
Is your head clear now?

113
00:10:29,670 --> 00:10:31,172
Then tell me in detail.

114
00:10:33,799 --> 00:10:35,009
Tell you what?

115
00:10:38,262 --> 00:10:39,472
If you won't, I'll just go.

116
00:10:40,389 --> 00:10:41,807
Hey, come on!

117
00:10:42,391 --> 00:10:43,976
Not you too.

118
00:10:46,395 --> 00:10:47,563
Sit down.

119
00:10:52,568 --> 00:10:54,862
Then give me a detailed explanation.

120
00:10:59,533 --> 00:11:01,911
Cheol-hui's older brother
contacted me first.

121
00:11:03,120 --> 00:11:05,247
So you gave him money and told him to go?

122
00:11:05,331 --> 00:11:07,833
Oh, come on!

123
00:11:08,793 --> 00:11:12,338
He said he was bad off.

124
00:11:12,421 --> 00:11:15,049
And isn't it better for kids
to be with their real dad?

125
00:11:16,634 --> 00:11:18,260
You said you'd play fair.

126
00:11:19,220 --> 00:11:23,557
I thought Cheol-hui's brother
would tell him before taking them.

127
00:11:27,395 --> 00:11:29,939
Jeez, are you really that naive?

128
00:11:31,941 --> 00:11:35,069
Hey, you know what my parents are like.

129
00:11:36,445 --> 00:11:38,697
If things don't work out with Cheol-hui,

130
00:11:38,781 --> 00:11:42,952
they'll drag me back
into an endless cycle of emotional labor.

131
00:11:43,035 --> 00:11:46,539
You sound so dramatic
when you talk about marital matchmaking.

132
00:11:48,499 --> 00:11:50,835
Isn't Jeong Ha-na the weird one here?

133
00:11:50,918 --> 00:11:54,296
I'm not some kind of supervillain.

134
00:11:54,380 --> 00:11:56,924
Why did she suddenly show up
that night to oppose me?

135
00:11:57,007 --> 00:12:01,762
Well, under the circumstances,
Ha-na just naturally--

136
00:12:01,846 --> 00:12:04,432
Shouldn't she have asked me first?

137
00:12:05,349 --> 00:12:07,476
Plus, Cheol-hui's brother is
the bad guy here.

138
00:12:12,982 --> 00:12:14,984
You saw my Cheol-hui

139
00:12:15,067 --> 00:12:19,613
in Jeong Ha-na's arms last night, right?

140
00:12:21,907 --> 00:12:24,368
I was really angry about that too.

141
00:12:24,452 --> 00:12:26,954
Ha-na even took Mr. Bong home.

142
00:12:31,417 --> 00:12:33,085
Hey, you don't think…

143
00:12:36,505 --> 00:12:37,965
Think what?

144
00:12:38,048 --> 00:12:40,593
MARRIAGE MORALE BOOST PROJECT
FIRST COUPLE IS BORN

145
00:12:42,928 --> 00:12:43,929
It looks good, right?

146
00:12:44,013 --> 00:12:47,266
Is this the promo flyer
that'll be distributed today?

147
00:12:47,349 --> 00:12:50,686
Yes, the PR office showed it to me,
so I brought it here.

148
00:12:50,769 --> 00:12:52,188
Here, take a seat.

149
00:12:52,271 --> 00:12:54,148
That's okay.

150
00:12:54,231 --> 00:12:56,650
My stomach seems lighter these days.

151
00:12:56,734 --> 00:12:59,528
It feels just right.
Plus, I can breathe easily.

152
00:12:59,612 --> 00:13:02,698
You should still sit down.
You're making me nervous.

153
00:13:02,781 --> 00:13:03,866
Fine then.

154
00:13:03,949 --> 00:13:08,287
My wife was the same way.
Then she called me from the hospital.

155
00:13:08,370 --> 00:13:10,122
- That's not good.
- Not good at all.

156
00:13:11,165 --> 00:13:12,291
Let's see here.

157
00:13:12,374 --> 00:13:17,213
My goodness! The photo turned out so well!

158
00:13:17,296 --> 00:13:20,758
Mr. Bong will be part
of the Dyan family then, right?

159
00:13:22,593 --> 00:13:25,095
There's no guarantee
until they get married.

160
00:13:25,179 --> 00:13:26,722
Getting married isn't easy.

161
00:13:27,640 --> 00:13:30,559
Mr. Han, why are you overthinking things?

162
00:13:30,643 --> 00:13:33,437
Watching dramas has made you prejudiced.

163
00:13:33,521 --> 00:13:35,105
You're right.

164
00:13:37,191 --> 00:13:39,485
Hey.

165
00:13:39,568 --> 00:13:41,487
Ms. Jeong, have you seen the promo flyer?

166
00:13:42,571 --> 00:13:44,573
This flyer won't be distributed today.

167
00:13:50,621 --> 00:13:52,623
Ms. Jeong Ha-na, wait a minute!

168
00:13:54,625 --> 00:13:56,252
What is it?

169
00:13:56,335 --> 00:13:58,587
You're too arbitrary
when it comes to work.

170
00:13:58,671 --> 00:13:59,964
Excuse me?

171
00:14:00,047 --> 00:14:02,800
You suddenly stopped
the photo shoot last night

172
00:14:02,883 --> 00:14:05,803
as well as the flyer distribution.
If we're on the same team--

173
00:14:05,886 --> 00:14:08,097
Are you saying I acted rashly?

174
00:14:08,180 --> 00:14:09,640
Am I wrong?

175
00:14:09,723 --> 00:14:12,935
I'm not the one who acted rashly.
That would be Ms. Oh In-a.

176
00:14:13,018 --> 00:14:14,353
Do you even know the facts?

177
00:14:15,020 --> 00:14:16,230
As the person in charge,

178
00:14:16,313 --> 00:14:20,359
shouldn't you give them a chance
to work out their misunderstandings?

179
00:14:20,442 --> 00:14:23,779
And shouldn't you trust
your team member's judgment?

180
00:14:23,863 --> 00:14:27,074
- Ms. Jeong!
- You're right. I acted rashly.

181
00:14:27,157 --> 00:14:28,784
I was too focused on transferring--

182
00:14:28,868 --> 00:14:30,160
I'm worried about you!

183
00:14:34,456 --> 00:14:36,500
You don't feel comfortable around me.

184
00:14:36,584 --> 00:14:38,502
You're miserable working for the team.

185
00:14:38,586 --> 00:14:39,753
Then doesn't that mean…

186
00:14:41,839 --> 00:14:43,424
you need this to succeed?

187
00:14:47,219 --> 00:14:48,387
Not like this.

188
00:14:51,891 --> 00:14:55,269
I don't want anyone to get hurt
because of me ever again.

189
00:15:00,941 --> 00:15:02,359
Is it because

190
00:15:03,402 --> 00:15:05,154
you have feelings for that someone?

191
00:15:16,707 --> 00:15:18,083
Cheol-hui.

192
00:15:18,167 --> 00:15:19,209
Come on in.

193
00:15:19,293 --> 00:15:21,587
- Cheol-hui.
- Hey.

194
00:15:22,630 --> 00:15:24,798
How did it go yesterday?

195
00:15:26,133 --> 00:15:27,134
Yesterday?

196
00:15:28,260 --> 00:15:30,220
Yesterday…

197
00:15:30,304 --> 00:15:32,973
Oh, my memories are blurry.

198
00:15:33,057 --> 00:15:35,309
What? Did you black out?

199
00:15:36,977 --> 00:15:39,396
I must have been nervous yesterday.

200
00:15:39,480 --> 00:15:43,150
I'm not usually the type who blacks out.

201
00:15:43,233 --> 00:15:46,946
Maybe you don't have memories,
but there are still feelings, right?

202
00:15:48,072 --> 00:15:49,698
How was it with Oh In-a?

203
00:15:50,491 --> 00:15:52,868
Was it different
talking to her while drunk?

204
00:15:55,537 --> 00:15:58,791
Ms. Oh In-a…

205
00:15:58,874 --> 00:16:00,459
Oh, right.

206
00:16:01,043 --> 00:16:02,294
That's a blur too.

207
00:16:03,170 --> 00:16:04,880
What's the last thing you remember?

208
00:16:07,257 --> 00:16:10,302
The last thing? I'm not sure…

209
00:16:16,016 --> 00:16:17,726
Ha-na.

210
00:16:20,312 --> 00:16:22,314
I can't send you off to her.

211
00:16:26,068 --> 00:16:27,277
Ha-na.

212
00:16:27,861 --> 00:16:30,739
Who? Jeong Ha-na?

213
00:16:30,823 --> 00:16:32,157
Yes.

214
00:16:33,826 --> 00:16:35,202
I'm sorry, sir.

215
00:16:35,285 --> 00:16:39,373
I'll take care of Mr. Bong's case quickly
before it gets out of hand.

216
00:16:40,040 --> 00:16:44,378
Mr. Choi, I thought you were
a perfectionist when it came to work,

217
00:16:44,461 --> 00:16:46,630
but you made a mistake.

218
00:16:46,714 --> 00:16:49,091
Good for you for being human.

219
00:16:50,259 --> 00:16:53,637
I couldn't let this slide,
so I took issue with the matter.

220
00:16:53,721 --> 00:16:56,015
I'll take responsibility for this.
Not Mr. Choi.

221
00:16:56,098 --> 00:16:57,516
You, Ms. Jeong?

222
00:16:59,268 --> 00:17:01,687
Yes. I'll stay with
the Marriage Morale Boost Team

223
00:17:01,770 --> 00:17:04,940
and successfully match Mr. Bong again.

224
00:17:09,236 --> 00:17:10,946
If this goes wrong again,

225
00:17:11,030 --> 00:17:14,491
I can't keep my promise to you.

226
00:17:14,575 --> 00:17:15,409
Do you understand?

227
00:17:23,584 --> 00:17:27,212
I'm basically unemployed now.

228
00:17:31,050 --> 00:17:33,135
Oh, dear, I can't believe this.

229
00:17:35,304 --> 00:17:39,683
Mr. Jo, does it mean I have to put down
a different occupation?

230
00:17:41,185 --> 00:17:42,394
Mr. Han.

231
00:17:45,355 --> 00:17:49,193
Are you interested
in appearing in a documentary?

232
00:17:49,276 --> 00:17:50,444
Excuse me?

233
00:17:52,112 --> 00:17:55,991
Turning a Problematic Probationary Worker
Into a Productive Society Member Project…

234
00:17:57,076 --> 00:17:59,119
I can picture it now.

235
00:18:00,788 --> 00:18:02,081
Mr. Jo?

236
00:18:02,164 --> 00:18:03,290
Yes?

237
00:18:03,957 --> 00:18:06,210
How about an interview with me?

238
00:18:07,294 --> 00:18:08,670
I'd love that.

239
00:18:08,754 --> 00:18:10,589
That's great.

240
00:18:10,672 --> 00:18:14,718
We finished the first screening
of your documents,

241
00:18:14,802 --> 00:18:15,636
but we must know

242
00:18:16,929 --> 00:18:18,388
more about your ideal woman.

243
00:18:20,182 --> 00:18:22,434
What? Me?

244
00:18:24,103 --> 00:18:25,521
Not you, Mr. Han?

245
00:18:31,026 --> 00:18:32,111
All right.

246
00:18:34,029 --> 00:18:40,035
Now please tell us
about your ideal woman in full detail.

247
00:18:41,286 --> 00:18:42,621
My ideal woman…

248
00:18:45,415 --> 00:18:46,500
Oh, I…

249
00:18:47,709 --> 00:18:49,294
That is…

250
00:18:57,803 --> 00:19:00,097
Anything is fine.

251
00:19:00,180 --> 00:19:03,142
Maybe you want to share the same hobbies.

252
00:19:03,225 --> 00:19:06,937
You can talk about
which celebrity she looks like

253
00:19:07,563 --> 00:19:10,482
or whether you want someone
who's good with kids.

254
00:19:13,277 --> 00:19:14,194
In that case…

255
00:19:18,782 --> 00:19:20,075
In terms of looks…

256
00:19:24,246 --> 00:19:26,415
Regarding hobbies…

257
00:19:30,586 --> 00:19:32,004
- Jeez.
- Come on!

258
00:19:38,594 --> 00:19:39,887
My stomach hurts.

259
00:19:42,389 --> 00:19:43,432
Are you okay?

260
00:19:43,515 --> 00:19:46,185
I'm so stressed that I might give birth!

261
00:19:46,268 --> 00:19:47,644
I'm sorry.

262
00:19:47,728 --> 00:19:51,523
Goodness. Don't be. I'm sorry.

263
00:20:03,744 --> 00:20:06,496
Hey, Sister-in-law.
Are you avoiding my calls?

264
00:20:13,337 --> 00:20:14,922
People avoid calls

265
00:20:16,173 --> 00:20:18,258
when they've done something wrong.

266
00:20:18,884 --> 00:20:20,302
Well…

267
00:20:20,385 --> 00:20:24,348
I'm going to need more money

268
00:20:24,431 --> 00:20:25,641
to make another attempt.

269
00:20:27,517 --> 00:20:28,936
There's no need to.

270
00:20:30,312 --> 00:20:32,105
Are you backing out?

271
00:20:34,191 --> 00:20:36,610
But from what I can tell,

272
00:20:36,693 --> 00:20:39,780
Cheol-hui doesn't know you gave me money

273
00:20:39,863 --> 00:20:42,950
to get rid of Ba-da and San-i.

274
00:20:43,033 --> 00:20:44,076
So what?

275
00:20:44,993 --> 00:20:48,747
I suppose I'll be
more or less inclined to talk

276
00:20:48,830 --> 00:20:50,999
depending on my bank account balance.

277
00:20:54,920 --> 00:20:58,340
Are you blackmailing me right now?

278
00:20:59,049 --> 00:21:02,636
Goodness, I wouldn't blackmail someone
who's about to become family.

279
00:21:02,719 --> 00:21:05,055
Let's just get along, okay?

280
00:21:05,138 --> 00:21:06,640
I'll be waiting.

281
00:21:08,433 --> 00:21:09,810
So how long will you wait?

282
00:21:24,658 --> 00:21:25,659
How long has it been?

283
00:21:29,079 --> 00:21:33,458
The person who came to see the kids.
That was you, wasn't it?

284
00:21:34,418 --> 00:21:36,503
Yes. I was just curious.

285
00:21:36,586 --> 00:21:37,963
Curious?

286
00:21:39,172 --> 00:21:40,716
All of a sudden?

287
00:21:40,799 --> 00:21:42,634
After five years?

288
00:21:42,718 --> 00:21:46,555
I heard you left the island,
so I was worried about that too.

289
00:21:46,638 --> 00:21:47,889
Why?

290
00:21:48,557 --> 00:21:50,434
You think I'll abandon them like you did?

291
00:21:51,226 --> 00:21:53,145
That's not it.

292
00:21:53,228 --> 00:21:55,897
You need to live your own life now.

293
00:21:56,606 --> 00:21:59,234
So you took money from In-a
to send the kids away?

294
00:21:59,985 --> 00:22:02,946
Studying abroad is better
for them than staying here.

295
00:22:04,072 --> 00:22:07,326
And since she's into you,
you should just--

296
00:22:07,409 --> 00:22:09,036
Are you serious right now?

297
00:22:20,339 --> 00:22:22,049
Don't you feel sorry for the kids?

298
00:22:24,176 --> 00:22:26,720
You have to be responsible
when it comes to family.

299
00:22:28,221 --> 00:22:31,933
I've given up on my life a long time ago.

300
00:22:32,684 --> 00:22:34,102
Your family is

301
00:22:35,645 --> 00:22:38,065
still your family
regardless of how hard life is.

302
00:22:39,900 --> 00:22:41,860
They're like my own kids.

303
00:22:43,361 --> 00:22:45,405
But from where they stand,

304
00:22:46,448 --> 00:22:49,493
you're their one and only father.

305
00:22:49,993 --> 00:22:53,872
If I can't provide for them,
it's better not to see them at all.

306
00:22:53,955 --> 00:22:55,832
Why suffer in hell together--

307
00:22:55,916 --> 00:22:57,292
Hell?

308
00:23:00,545 --> 00:23:03,632
Then you hold their hands tightly in hell
and survive together.

309
00:23:03,715 --> 00:23:05,467
That's what a family does.

310
00:23:06,510 --> 00:23:09,763
Fine, I get it. That's enough.

311
00:23:21,983 --> 00:23:23,151
So now what?

312
00:23:25,445 --> 00:23:27,114
What are you going to do?

313
00:23:28,198 --> 00:23:29,658
What about you?

314
00:23:31,201 --> 00:23:32,828
Are you going to marry her?

315
00:23:37,624 --> 00:23:40,627
Right. It's true that I used the woman

316
00:23:40,710 --> 00:23:43,421
whom you like for my own benefit.

317
00:23:43,505 --> 00:23:45,173
But you're different than me.

318
00:23:46,925 --> 00:23:49,553
You should be with someone

319
00:23:49,636 --> 00:23:52,889
who will stay with you forever
even if you have nothing.

320
00:23:52,973 --> 00:23:55,142
Then you won't get divorced like I did.

321
00:23:55,725 --> 00:23:57,227
Are you kidding me?

322
00:24:03,900 --> 00:24:08,530
By the way, I think the kids have
a different woman in mind for you.

323
00:24:11,825 --> 00:24:13,160
Who are you talking about?

324
00:24:13,243 --> 00:24:16,079
The woman who picked up
the kids at the airport.

325
00:24:16,163 --> 00:24:20,834
She used all of her strength
to protect them. Jeez.

326
00:24:22,669 --> 00:24:24,045
Are you talking about Ha-na?

327
00:24:24,129 --> 00:24:26,256
I don't know.

328
00:24:26,339 --> 00:24:28,383
I'm the twins' father,

329
00:24:29,009 --> 00:24:33,471
but they said she was going
to live with you, so they went with her.

330
00:24:33,555 --> 00:24:34,848
Didn't they tell you?

331
00:24:37,851 --> 00:24:39,060
I…

332
00:24:41,855 --> 00:24:43,398
MARRIAGE MORALE BOOST PROJECT

333
00:24:43,481 --> 00:24:45,692
Your interview
in the Injeong City promo flyer

334
00:24:45,775 --> 00:24:47,319
has been put on hold.

335
00:24:47,402 --> 00:24:49,946
They're also revisiting
the documentary footage release.

336
00:24:53,200 --> 00:24:55,160
I'm so sad, Mr. Kim.

337
00:24:56,870 --> 00:24:59,581
Things were going well
with Cheol-hui yesterday,

338
00:25:00,624 --> 00:25:02,876
but I can't declare it our first date.

339
00:25:04,794 --> 00:25:06,713
What should we do about this sponsorship?

340
00:25:12,552 --> 00:25:15,722
I'm going to keep trying
and see what fate has in store for me.

341
00:25:15,805 --> 00:25:19,309
DYAN MART
EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR, OH IN-A

342
00:25:25,106 --> 00:25:27,275
This boxed lunch is my apology.

343
00:25:32,906 --> 00:25:34,449
I met with my brother.

344
00:25:35,283 --> 00:25:39,162
You went through a lot
to bring the twins back.

345
00:25:40,330 --> 00:25:42,540
But I had no idea and got drunk.

346
00:25:45,794 --> 00:25:47,837
I guess you heard the whole story.

347
00:25:48,838 --> 00:25:53,802
I also heard you say
you couldn't send me off to In-a.

348
00:25:54,552 --> 00:25:58,098
Oh, about that…

349
00:25:58,848 --> 00:25:59,766
Thank you.

350
00:26:01,184 --> 00:26:02,894
It was a family matter, yet…

351
00:26:05,146 --> 00:26:07,399
While I'm here, I'm still in charge.

352
00:26:08,525 --> 00:26:10,318
We stopped printing the promo flyers

353
00:26:10,402 --> 00:26:12,070
that were to be distributed today.

354
00:26:12,779 --> 00:26:15,824
I thought I should ask you about it first.

355
00:26:17,158 --> 00:26:19,953
I should also talk to In-a.

356
00:26:20,036 --> 00:26:22,038
She must be troubled over this too.

357
00:26:22,998 --> 00:26:25,917
Talking to her is the best way
to avoid any misunderstanding.

358
00:26:26,668 --> 00:26:29,296
I'm sure Ms. Oh is waiting for you.

359
00:26:31,506 --> 00:26:34,050
I feel very lucky

360
00:26:34,134 --> 00:26:35,802
that you're in charge of me.

361
00:26:50,358 --> 00:26:52,736
When it comes to family,

362
00:26:52,819 --> 00:26:56,197
everyone has at least
one story they can't tell others.

363
00:26:57,073 --> 00:26:59,451
They say life is the same for everyone

364
00:26:59,534 --> 00:27:01,786
in a brave effort to comfort themselves.

365
00:27:04,497 --> 00:27:06,374
Let's put everything back in its place.

366
00:27:07,876 --> 00:27:09,127
I have to.

367
00:27:18,553 --> 00:27:20,764
KIM SI-EUN, 33 YEARS OLD

368
00:27:36,738 --> 00:27:39,366
Do you really think this is right?

369
00:27:41,034 --> 00:27:43,078
But, Mr. Jo,

370
00:27:43,161 --> 00:27:46,915
you said she came closest
to your idea of an ideal woman.

371
00:27:47,874 --> 00:27:50,960
I know, but…

372
00:27:52,545 --> 00:27:55,298
Shouldn't I be more prudent?

373
00:27:55,382 --> 00:27:59,803
Just because you send a heart
doesn't mean you'll match immediately.

374
00:27:59,886 --> 00:28:02,138
You have to meet her first

375
00:28:02,222 --> 00:28:05,892
before you know
if you're right for each other.

376
00:28:07,102 --> 00:28:08,019
Right.

377
00:28:12,273 --> 00:28:13,691
I'm going to press it.

378
00:28:27,997 --> 00:28:29,040
MATCH REQUEST COMPLETE

379
00:28:32,836 --> 00:28:33,878
Wow.

380
00:28:46,224 --> 00:28:47,434
I'm here…

381
00:28:49,811 --> 00:28:51,521
to make a confession.

382
00:28:53,732 --> 00:28:58,069
I tried to send
Ba-da and San-i to your brother.

383
00:28:59,696 --> 00:29:00,864
I know.

384
00:29:00,947 --> 00:29:02,365
Excuse me?

385
00:29:02,449 --> 00:29:03,992
He told me.

386
00:29:16,546 --> 00:29:17,714
I'm sorry.

387
00:29:20,508 --> 00:29:22,886
I'm the one who should be sorry.

388
00:29:23,636 --> 00:29:28,475
My brother is the one
who used your innocence against you.

389
00:29:30,268 --> 00:29:31,770
But you know,

390
00:29:31,853 --> 00:29:35,315
you shouldn't give money to people

391
00:29:37,108 --> 00:29:38,318
whom you don't know well.

392
00:29:39,736 --> 00:29:40,945
I did that

393
00:29:42,614 --> 00:29:45,283
because we might become family.

394
00:29:45,867 --> 00:29:48,119
I know being the twins' guardian

395
00:29:49,621 --> 00:29:54,167
makes it uncomfortable
for the other person.

396
00:29:57,212 --> 00:29:58,588
I thought if I helped,

397
00:30:00,006 --> 00:30:03,259
both you and the kids would like it.

398
00:30:09,682 --> 00:30:10,642
In-a.

399
00:30:12,477 --> 00:30:14,312
Being family is about

400
00:30:15,730 --> 00:30:18,274
bickering and fighting
while living together.

401
00:30:19,651 --> 00:30:23,112
If there's a problem,
you should talk it out

402
00:30:23,196 --> 00:30:25,240
or fight it out to solve the problem.

403
00:30:26,449 --> 00:30:29,577
Sending family away
because you have a lot of money is…

404
00:30:32,205 --> 00:30:33,957
That isn't being family.

405
00:30:40,255 --> 00:30:41,673
I grew up in a family…

406
00:30:44,259 --> 00:30:46,553
with a lot of money but no love to give.

407
00:30:47,971 --> 00:30:51,474
I hated it when I was young…

408
00:30:54,561 --> 00:30:57,897
but now it seems I've become one of them.

409
00:31:10,869 --> 00:31:14,414
In-a, you're a really good person.

410
00:31:19,043 --> 00:31:21,379
A person who is truly sincere.

411
00:31:26,009 --> 00:31:27,302
In-a.

412
00:31:29,012 --> 00:31:30,513
I don't think

413
00:31:31,431 --> 00:31:33,224
we're the right match…

414
00:31:35,643 --> 00:31:39,022
for each other.

415
00:31:43,943 --> 00:31:48,823
I know that in my head.

416
00:31:50,742 --> 00:31:55,038
But my heart keeps telling me
that I like you, Cheol-hui.

417
00:32:00,376 --> 00:32:03,922
We've lived in different worlds
for the past 30 years.

418
00:32:06,090 --> 00:32:07,967
So how can you tell

419
00:32:08,635 --> 00:32:11,054
we're not a good match
after meeting only a few times?

420
00:32:15,725 --> 00:32:17,352
Cheol-hui.

421
00:32:20,939 --> 00:32:25,485
By any chance, do you have feelings
for someone other than me?

422
00:32:33,743 --> 00:32:36,621
The age gap between Cheol-hui
and this person is too wide.

423
00:32:41,584 --> 00:32:44,003
This person prefers the DINK lifestyle.

424
00:32:44,754 --> 00:32:46,214
MR. BONG CHEOL-HUI

425
00:32:49,884 --> 00:32:53,221
EVERYTHING ENDED WELL WITH IN-A

426
00:32:58,017 --> 00:32:59,102
Hurry!

427
00:33:01,062 --> 00:33:02,188
I said, hurry up!

428
00:33:02,271 --> 00:33:04,691
Hey! Stop running,
or they'll complain downstairs!

429
00:33:04,774 --> 00:33:06,734
It's okay.

430
00:33:06,818 --> 00:33:09,612
It's not okay!
Our downstairs neighbors will suffer!

431
00:33:09,696 --> 00:33:11,948
Ba-da is an angel right now,

432
00:33:12,031 --> 00:33:13,366
so she's flying.

433
00:33:13,449 --> 00:33:14,409
What?

434
00:33:15,618 --> 00:33:16,953
Hey, Ba-da. What's that?

435
00:33:17,036 --> 00:33:19,247
Uncle, haven't you heard of Cupid?

436
00:33:19,330 --> 00:33:21,249
If his arrow hits you, you fall in love.

437
00:33:33,344 --> 00:33:35,263
- Uncle?
- Are you okay?

438
00:33:36,389 --> 00:33:38,850
- Are you okay?
- Maybe he isn't.

439
00:33:57,660 --> 00:33:58,661
My stomach hurts.

440
00:33:59,620 --> 00:34:01,080
Good work today.

441
00:34:01,164 --> 00:34:02,123
Good work today.

442
00:34:05,334 --> 00:34:07,628
What's with the weird vibe?

443
00:34:09,172 --> 00:34:12,175
I think Mr. Jo likes to sabotage himself.

444
00:34:12,258 --> 00:34:14,927
It took him forever
to complete a match request.

445
00:34:15,011 --> 00:34:16,471
Did something happen?

446
00:34:16,554 --> 00:34:19,140
Everything was great in the beginning.

447
00:34:24,854 --> 00:34:27,690
So you're saying when you feel frustrated,

448
00:34:27,774 --> 00:34:29,358
you go to a temple, right?

449
00:34:29,442 --> 00:34:32,403
Yes. I like to eat temple food because--

450
00:34:32,487 --> 00:34:34,989
- Because you'll have a good year?
- That's right.

451
00:34:35,073 --> 00:34:37,366
That's what my mom says often.

452
00:34:37,450 --> 00:34:40,411
Oh, so your mother goes to temples too.

453
00:34:40,495 --> 00:34:41,537
Yes.

454
00:34:43,414 --> 00:34:45,124
What do you do on weekends?

455
00:34:46,084 --> 00:34:48,544
I'm not sure. What about you?

456
00:34:48,628 --> 00:34:52,548
I always spend at least one day
to have a family meal.

457
00:34:52,632 --> 00:34:53,633
Don't say that!

458
00:34:55,426 --> 00:34:57,470
That's not easy to do these days.

459
00:34:57,553 --> 00:34:59,931
You must've grown up in a happy household.

460
00:35:00,807 --> 00:35:02,183
I guess so.

461
00:35:03,810 --> 00:35:07,105
I go hiking with my father on the weekends

462
00:35:07,188 --> 00:35:10,441
and have drinks with his friends often.

463
00:35:12,110 --> 00:35:14,862
I see. Often?

464
00:35:17,990 --> 00:35:19,200
Ms. Si-eun.

465
00:35:20,201 --> 00:35:22,161
I think you'll get along well with my mom.

466
00:35:22,245 --> 00:35:23,329
Excuse me?

467
00:35:23,412 --> 00:35:25,498
Do you want to meet my mom next time?

468
00:35:27,959 --> 00:35:29,794
We'll need to call Mr. Jo back.

469
00:35:40,054 --> 00:35:42,348
Someone is here.

470
00:35:42,431 --> 00:35:44,600
Hello, I heard that my Won-sang

471
00:35:44,684 --> 00:35:46,769
- was here--
- Mom?

472
00:35:50,356 --> 00:35:52,859
Thank you for your hard work.

473
00:35:52,942 --> 00:35:56,612
I'm Won-sang's mother.

474
00:35:56,696 --> 00:35:59,740
What brings you here, ma'am?

475
00:35:59,824 --> 00:36:01,993
I was just passing by

476
00:36:02,076 --> 00:36:05,997
and remembered Won-sang had a meeting
with this team and decided to pop in.

477
00:36:06,080 --> 00:36:07,874
I was rather curious too.

478
00:36:09,125 --> 00:36:13,921
Will my Won-sang go
on a second date right away?

479
00:36:16,591 --> 00:36:18,176
No, ma'am.

480
00:36:18,259 --> 00:36:20,595
I'm afraid that won't be possible.

481
00:36:21,637 --> 00:36:22,471
Why?

482
00:36:23,431 --> 00:36:25,224
Did my son get rejected?

483
00:36:26,392 --> 00:36:28,394
No, not exactly.

484
00:36:28,978 --> 00:36:30,563
We received some feedback.

485
00:36:31,856 --> 00:36:34,233
The lady who met with Mr. Jo said

486
00:36:34,317 --> 00:36:37,695
she didn't have a problem
interacting with his family

487
00:36:37,778 --> 00:36:41,407
or meeting up often if they got married.

488
00:36:41,490 --> 00:36:42,658
But?

489
00:36:42,742 --> 00:36:46,579
But if she marries Mr. Jo,

490
00:36:46,662 --> 00:36:51,584
it'll feel like she's marrying you
and not Mr. Jo himself.

491
00:36:51,667 --> 00:36:53,002
What?

492
00:36:53,085 --> 00:36:56,589
Wait, I thought
we were a really good match.

493
00:36:56,672 --> 00:36:59,675
Not with you, Mr. Jo,
but with your mother.

494
00:37:02,470 --> 00:37:05,890
Saying you want your mother
at the second meeting

495
00:37:05,973 --> 00:37:06,849
was really…

496
00:37:10,186 --> 00:37:12,104
Did you really say that, Son?

497
00:37:13,731 --> 00:37:15,107
Well, I mean…

498
00:37:16,651 --> 00:37:17,944
Mr. Jo.

499
00:37:18,027 --> 00:37:20,988
Do you want to see her
because you really like her?

500
00:37:21,822 --> 00:37:25,576
Your ideal woman requirements
seemed a bit peculiar.

501
00:37:25,660 --> 00:37:26,953
What kind of requirements?

502
00:37:28,120 --> 00:37:29,330
The first one is

503
00:37:29,413 --> 00:37:32,333
someone who isn't busy
and can use her time freely.

504
00:37:32,416 --> 00:37:36,295
That's because we have
weekly family meals.

505
00:37:38,005 --> 00:37:40,091
The second requirement is about religion.

506
00:37:40,174 --> 00:37:43,052
But that's because Mom likes temples.

507
00:37:45,972 --> 00:37:48,224
Then what about a person who lives nearby?

508
00:37:48,933 --> 00:37:51,185
I thought if she visits frequently,

509
00:37:51,269 --> 00:37:54,021
my parents would like it…

510
00:37:54,105 --> 00:37:55,856
Out of all these conditions,

511
00:37:55,940 --> 00:37:58,567
not one of them has to do
with what you like.

512
00:38:03,739 --> 00:38:05,199
Is that true?

513
00:38:05,783 --> 00:38:07,618
Yes. None of them.

514
00:38:08,577 --> 00:38:10,788
Won-sang, why did you do that?

515
00:38:11,455 --> 00:38:13,541
The son whose parents are proud of him.

516
00:38:14,667 --> 00:38:16,877
It's because of that pressure, right?

517
00:38:21,465 --> 00:38:25,386
I didn't know my son felt
this way because of me.

518
00:38:25,970 --> 00:38:28,347
Mom, I thought that

519
00:38:28,431 --> 00:38:32,727
I might as well marry someone
who got along with you.

520
00:38:32,810 --> 00:38:36,731
Are you kidding me?
I'm not the one getting married. You are.

521
00:38:36,814 --> 00:38:37,982
That hurts.

522
00:38:39,275 --> 00:38:40,192
Son.

523
00:38:40,276 --> 00:38:43,487
Thank you for living up
to my expectations.

524
00:38:43,571 --> 00:38:47,742
But you should choose the person
whom you really want to marry.

525
00:38:47,825 --> 00:38:50,411
It's okay even if
I don't see you all year round.

526
00:38:50,494 --> 00:38:53,205
Please just get married, okay?

527
00:38:53,289 --> 00:38:54,582
Okay.

528
00:39:03,132 --> 00:39:06,594
WE HELP YOUNG PEOPLE GET MARRIED

MARRIAGE MORALE BOOST
PROJECT APPLICATION

530
00:39:23,319 --> 00:39:24,570
Excuse me.

531
00:39:24,653 --> 00:39:29,075
Is this the Marriage Morale Boost Team
that can match you before the ink dries

532
00:39:29,158 --> 00:39:30,826
on your application?

533
00:39:31,911 --> 00:39:34,705
Cheol-hui, you didn't say you were coming!

534
00:39:34,789 --> 00:39:37,375
You said that you provide
after-sales service.

535
00:39:38,292 --> 00:39:40,544
- Of course. Right this way.
- Okay.

536
00:39:42,630 --> 00:39:44,340
- Please excuse me.
- Sure.

537
00:39:44,423 --> 00:39:46,801
You're all working so hard.

538
00:39:50,888 --> 00:39:52,598
Do we really provide such services?

539
00:39:56,102 --> 00:39:58,062
I don't know.

540
00:39:59,438 --> 00:40:01,023
I'm going to the PR office.

541
00:40:01,107 --> 00:40:03,651
I want after-sales service too!

542
00:40:03,734 --> 00:40:06,570
Why won't you do it? What about me?

543
00:40:15,287 --> 00:40:16,122
What?

544
00:40:16,705 --> 00:40:20,251
I narrowed it down to people
whom I think will be decent matches.

545
00:40:22,795 --> 00:40:24,046
I'm not here for this.

546
00:40:25,881 --> 00:40:28,008
I came to rewrite my profile.

547
00:40:29,051 --> 00:40:30,219
Your profile?

548
00:40:30,302 --> 00:40:32,972
In-a liked me, so I was thankful

549
00:40:33,055 --> 00:40:36,350
and thought I should become
a good match for her.

550
00:40:36,434 --> 00:40:38,894
But I couldn't maintain that thought.

551
00:40:39,854 --> 00:40:44,483
By any chance, do you have feelings
for someone other than me?

552
00:40:47,194 --> 00:40:50,531
What do I like?
What's a good match for me?

553
00:40:50,614 --> 00:40:52,199
I want to find out.

554
00:40:52,992 --> 00:40:54,660
So I'd like you to help me.

555
00:40:55,369 --> 00:40:57,997
That's the after-sales service I want.

556
00:40:59,623 --> 00:41:01,417
Okay. I'll do it.

557
00:41:05,421 --> 00:41:07,006
What exactly is it?

558
00:41:07,089 --> 00:41:09,383
We don't offer
after-sales service to just anyone--

559
00:41:09,467 --> 00:41:10,634
Just anyone?

560
00:41:10,718 --> 00:41:12,219
What I mean is…

561
00:41:14,221 --> 00:41:16,182
- Good day, sir.
- Good day.

562
00:41:16,265 --> 00:41:18,809
You're…

563
00:41:18,893 --> 00:41:20,978
I'm Han Bin from
Marriage Morale Boost Team.

564
00:41:21,061 --> 00:41:23,314
Right. The Marriage Morale Boost Team.

565
00:41:23,397 --> 00:41:25,107
Is your probationary period almost up?

566
00:41:25,191 --> 00:41:26,108
Yes, sir.

567
00:41:27,443 --> 00:41:28,903
Your parents must be happy.

568
00:41:28,986 --> 00:41:30,404
Yes, they are.

569
00:41:30,488 --> 00:41:33,324
So how old are you, Mr. Han?

570
00:41:33,407 --> 00:41:34,658
Excuse me?

571
00:41:34,742 --> 00:41:37,369
You seem to be the same age as my son.

572
00:41:37,953 --> 00:41:39,788
His birthday is coming up soon,

573
00:41:39,872 --> 00:41:44,084
but I have no idea
what young people like these days.

574
00:41:46,086 --> 00:41:49,507
I think it depends on each person's taste.

575
00:41:50,716 --> 00:41:52,968
Yes, I suppose you're right.

576
00:41:53,052 --> 00:41:55,513
What about the preferences of young people

577
00:41:55,596 --> 00:41:58,140
who enjoy staying at home
and like computers?

578
00:41:58,224 --> 00:42:01,101
He sounds like an introvert.

579
00:42:01,185 --> 00:42:03,437
Would he like games by any chance?

580
00:42:03,521 --> 00:42:05,648
No, I don't think so.

581
00:42:05,731 --> 00:42:09,068
But I suppose he's not like you, Mr. Han.

582
00:42:11,904 --> 00:42:13,072
Here's the elevator.

583
00:42:17,993 --> 00:42:19,662
Aren't you getting on?

584
00:42:19,745 --> 00:42:22,039
We're going down, sir.

585
00:42:22,122 --> 00:42:24,458
I see. Have a good day then.

586
00:42:24,542 --> 00:42:26,126
- Goodbye, sir.
- Goodbye.

587
00:42:33,801 --> 00:42:34,677
Where do we begin?

588
00:42:45,813 --> 00:42:47,856
- Oh, dear!
- Sit down!

589
00:42:47,940 --> 00:42:50,317
- Sit here!
- My water broke!

590
00:42:52,069 --> 00:42:53,612
We need to call your husband!

591
00:42:53,696 --> 00:42:55,406
- He's on a business trip.
- What?

592
00:42:55,489 --> 00:42:58,367
It's not my due date yet!

593
00:42:58,450 --> 00:43:00,828
You have another family member
or a guardian?

594
00:43:00,911 --> 00:43:02,663
We don't have time for this!

595
00:43:02,746 --> 00:43:03,872
The hospital!

596
00:43:03,956 --> 00:43:05,833
Cheol-hui, give me the car keys!

597
00:43:05,916 --> 00:43:07,710
Just breathe!

598
00:43:10,004 --> 00:43:12,798
Mr. Yang, please call her husband.

599
00:43:12,881 --> 00:43:14,466
Her husband? Right.

600
00:43:15,009 --> 00:43:15,843
What is it?

601
00:43:26,145 --> 00:43:27,271
Ha-na, step on it!

602
00:43:51,253 --> 00:43:53,547
- Ha-na!
- It's killing me.

603
00:43:53,631 --> 00:43:55,299
Step on the gas!

604
00:44:00,220 --> 00:44:02,890
KS WOMEN'S CLINIC

605
00:44:02,973 --> 00:44:03,932
This is an emergency!

606
00:44:04,016 --> 00:44:06,477
There's a baby coming!

607
00:44:06,560 --> 00:44:07,895
Get a wheelchair.

608
00:44:08,646 --> 00:44:10,105
Gosh, are you family?

609
00:44:10,189 --> 00:44:11,982
No, we're her co-workers.

610
00:44:12,066 --> 00:44:13,734
The family will be a bit late.

611
00:44:13,817 --> 00:44:17,154
- Here, sit down.
- Goodness.

612
00:44:18,113 --> 00:44:20,616
You can let go now.

613
00:44:24,078 --> 00:44:26,872
Mom!

614
00:44:27,623 --> 00:44:28,582
Mr. Yang?

615
00:44:28,666 --> 00:44:29,792
Are you at the hospital?

616
00:44:29,875 --> 00:44:33,212
It'll take Ms. Lee's husband another hour.

617
00:44:33,295 --> 00:44:35,798
Her husband will be here in an hour.

618
00:44:35,881 --> 00:44:38,175
Mom!

619
00:44:38,258 --> 00:44:41,387
She needs to go straight into surgery,

620
00:44:41,470 --> 00:44:42,596
so please check in first.

621
00:44:42,680 --> 00:44:44,264
- Okay.
- I'm hanging up now.

622
00:44:49,478 --> 00:44:50,687
Thank you.

623
00:44:56,652 --> 00:44:58,320
Look at your hair, Cheol-hui.

624
00:45:00,489 --> 00:45:02,366
I thought I was going to go bald.

625
00:45:02,449 --> 00:45:04,493
- Come here.
- What?

626
00:45:17,339 --> 00:45:18,340
All done.

627
00:45:24,721 --> 00:45:26,056
Are you sick?

628
00:45:27,057 --> 00:45:28,517
No.

629
00:45:35,941 --> 00:45:37,317
Mr. Choi.

630
00:45:38,235 --> 00:45:39,653
Are you alone, Mr. Yang?

631
00:45:39,736 --> 00:45:41,530
Ms. Lee went into labor.

632
00:45:42,364 --> 00:45:44,074
What? All of a sudden?

633
00:45:44,158 --> 00:45:46,952
But her due date isn't for another month.

634
00:45:47,035 --> 00:45:50,998
Yes. Anyway, Ms. Jeong
and Mr. Bong took her to the hospital.

635
00:45:51,081 --> 00:45:52,791
Mr. Bong went with them?

636
00:45:52,875 --> 00:45:55,919
Yes, he came by earlier
asking for after-sales service.

637
00:45:56,003 --> 00:45:58,464
- Did you contact the rest of her family?
- Yes.

638
00:46:04,595 --> 00:46:06,346
Are you Ms. Lee Ji-gyeong's guardian?

639
00:46:06,430 --> 00:46:07,598
Yes, I'm her husband.

640
00:46:07,681 --> 00:46:10,767
Your wife just gave birth
and is now in the recovery room.

641
00:46:13,145 --> 00:46:15,022
Would you like to see your baby now?

642
00:46:15,105 --> 00:46:16,607
- Yes.
- Follow me.

643
00:46:24,531 --> 00:46:26,033
My goodness.

644
00:46:26,909 --> 00:46:28,702
What a pretty baby.

645
00:46:31,371 --> 00:46:33,540
How can you be so pretty?

646
00:46:33,624 --> 00:46:35,125
You're beautiful.

647
00:46:38,795 --> 00:46:40,797
The baby is so tiny.

648
00:46:42,049 --> 00:46:43,217
Thank you so much.

649
00:46:45,052 --> 00:46:47,804
It would've been hard
for my wife if she'd been alone.

650
00:46:54,269 --> 00:46:57,564
Why are you crying on such a happy day?

651
00:46:59,816 --> 00:47:01,443
Visiting hours are over now.

652
00:47:01,527 --> 00:47:02,653
- Okay.
- Thank you.

653
00:47:06,490 --> 00:47:09,284
By the way,
when will Ms. Lee's parents arrive?

654
00:47:10,285 --> 00:47:12,621
Well, the thing is…

655
00:47:14,081 --> 00:47:18,418
What is it?
Don't tell me you didn't contact them.

656
00:47:18,502 --> 00:47:19,670
It's just that…

657
00:47:20,754 --> 00:47:23,090
After we got married,
we became estranged from them.

658
00:47:23,173 --> 00:47:25,592
My mother-in-law was
very opposed to our marriage.

659
00:47:26,134 --> 00:47:30,264
She probably doesn't even know
Ji-gyeong was pregnant.

660
00:47:30,847 --> 00:47:32,891
What a shame.

661
00:47:34,017 --> 00:47:36,228
You should still call her.

662
00:47:36,311 --> 00:47:38,981
I'm sure that's what Ms. Lee would want.

663
00:47:54,246 --> 00:47:56,456
- Hello.
- Mother.

664
00:47:56,540 --> 00:48:00,627
- Father.
- Goodness, I'm so proud of you!

665
00:48:00,711 --> 00:48:02,796
Thank you.

666
00:48:02,879 --> 00:48:04,381
Congratulations.

667
00:48:04,464 --> 00:48:07,342
- The baby takes after me a lot.
- Gosh.

668
00:48:07,426 --> 00:48:09,428
Yes, I heard the baby looks just like you.

669
00:48:09,511 --> 00:48:11,430
I heard the baby looks bright and clever.

670
00:48:11,513 --> 00:48:14,182
How's Ji-gyeong? Is she okay?

671
00:48:14,808 --> 00:48:16,935
You stopped calling us.

672
00:48:17,019 --> 00:48:18,687
- I'm sorry.
- You should've visited.

673
00:48:21,773 --> 00:48:23,483
- Here you go.
- Thank you.

674
00:48:25,736 --> 00:48:27,404
You had a hectic day today.

675
00:48:30,324 --> 00:48:32,075
Today was rather amazing.

676
00:48:32,159 --> 00:48:34,119
A new life came into being,
and I was there.

677
00:48:34,870 --> 00:48:36,538
Isn't that moving?

678
00:48:36,622 --> 00:48:37,998
Yes.

679
00:48:39,916 --> 00:48:42,169
Did you see Ms. Lee's mother's shoes?

680
00:48:42,252 --> 00:48:44,546
She came running with slippers on.

681
00:48:44,630 --> 00:48:46,590
That was very touching too.

682
00:48:47,507 --> 00:48:50,719
So was the way
Mr. Lee's father-in-law hugged him.

683
00:48:52,679 --> 00:48:57,184
Ha-na, have you ever thought about it?

684
00:48:58,310 --> 00:49:00,479
Me? Think about what?

685
00:49:00,562 --> 00:49:03,148
About having a baby who's just like you.

686
00:49:03,857 --> 00:49:05,692
I think it would be very cute.

687
00:49:06,818 --> 00:49:07,903
It would be, right?

688
00:49:08,487 --> 00:49:09,446
Yes.

689
00:49:11,490 --> 00:49:14,368
I don't plan on getting married,
so how can I have a baby?

690
00:49:19,164 --> 00:49:22,501
In Ms. Lee's case,
she married her compatible husband.

691
00:49:22,584 --> 00:49:25,962
She lives happily with him
without her parents in the equation.

692
00:49:26,630 --> 00:49:28,507
You have to be lucky to end up like them.

693
00:49:30,884 --> 00:49:33,261
But isn't it possible
to live well together?

694
00:49:34,304 --> 00:49:36,598
Why overthink things from the start?

695
00:49:37,683 --> 00:49:38,850
Don't you agree?

696
00:50:13,677 --> 00:50:15,303
TEAM GROUP CHAT

697
00:50:15,387 --> 00:50:18,181
Our little Thump Thump says hello!

698
00:50:18,265 --> 00:50:22,102
I'm so grateful.
Thanks to you, my baby and I are well.

699
00:50:22,185 --> 00:50:23,895
That's amazing. Congratulations.

700
00:50:23,979 --> 00:50:26,440
Wow, Thump Thump is amazing.

701
00:50:26,523 --> 00:50:28,567
How are you feeling?

702
00:50:28,650 --> 00:50:30,736
Take good care of yourself, Ms. Lee.

703
00:50:45,792 --> 00:50:46,918
Hi, Mom.

704
00:50:47,002 --> 00:50:50,672
Hello, my darling daughter.
Are you off work now?

705
00:50:50,756 --> 00:50:54,050
Did you eat before going home?
You're not sick, are you?

706
00:50:54,134 --> 00:50:56,219
Everything is okay, right?

707
00:50:56,303 --> 00:50:57,804
Yes.

708
00:50:57,888 --> 00:51:00,474
I wanted to hear your voice, so I called.

709
00:51:01,183 --> 00:51:03,769
Why? Did you have a rough day at work?

710
00:51:03,852 --> 00:51:07,397
Remember Ms. Lee from my team?
The pregnant lady?

711
00:51:08,190 --> 00:51:10,609
She suddenly had her baby today.

712
00:51:10,692 --> 00:51:12,486
And I took her to the hospital.

713
00:51:12,569 --> 00:51:14,780
Good job, sweetheart.

714
00:51:15,363 --> 00:51:17,908
The baby was so tiny and cute.

715
00:51:18,909 --> 00:51:20,660
It felt a little strange.

716
00:51:21,244 --> 00:51:23,455
But you didn't like babies before.

717
00:51:24,247 --> 00:51:25,665
What's going on?

718
00:51:26,500 --> 00:51:28,084
Are you seeing someone?

719
00:51:29,002 --> 00:51:31,254
Where is this coming from?

720
00:51:31,338 --> 00:51:35,217
What? You helped to bring
new life into the world for a family.

721
00:51:35,300 --> 00:51:37,761
There's no law saying
you can't make your own family.

722
00:51:38,386 --> 00:51:41,223
I'm happy to have you in my life, Ha-na.

723
00:51:41,306 --> 00:51:44,184
I just want you
to feel the same happiness.

724
00:51:46,895 --> 00:51:49,231
Mom, what if I bring someone

725
00:51:49,314 --> 00:51:51,900
you don't like and marry him?

726
00:51:52,526 --> 00:51:55,654
I'm fine as long as you like him.

727
00:51:55,737 --> 00:51:58,698
It'll be someone
you'll spend the rest of your life with.

728
00:51:58,782 --> 00:52:00,450
That's what's important.

729
00:52:01,910 --> 00:52:03,119
Really?

730
00:52:03,203 --> 00:52:04,329
Of course.

731
00:52:04,412 --> 00:52:06,998
I'm sure this is how
all parents feel these days.

732
00:52:07,082 --> 00:52:10,001
They're all saying,
"Please just get married."

733
00:52:10,085 --> 00:52:11,670
Nobody is nitpicky.

734
00:52:11,753 --> 00:52:15,674
They're more concerned about their kids
growing old and dying alone.

735
00:52:16,341 --> 00:52:19,010
The old saying that marriage is
the union of two families

736
00:52:19,094 --> 00:52:20,887
is becoming a thing of the past.

737
00:52:20,971 --> 00:52:22,722
- Show your face, Won-sang.
- Why a photo?

738
00:52:22,806 --> 00:52:25,767
I want to show off
to my neighbors. One, two…

739
00:52:25,851 --> 00:52:29,604
Parents these days are
younger than before.

740
00:52:29,688 --> 00:52:31,523
The baby is smiling!

741
00:52:31,606 --> 00:52:33,024
You did well.

742
00:52:35,819 --> 00:52:37,654
Babies born as unexpected gifts

743
00:52:38,989 --> 00:52:40,907
always create miracles.

744
00:52:46,955 --> 00:52:49,708
In the end, what's important is
the couple's feelings.

745
00:52:50,458 --> 00:52:52,627
Now, family problems are obstacles

746
00:52:52,711 --> 00:52:55,881
that can be easily overcome
based on how much

747
00:52:55,964 --> 00:52:58,174
the couple cares for each other.

748
00:53:02,387 --> 00:53:04,097
MARRIAGE IS A HOME-COOKED MEAL

749
00:53:04,681 --> 00:53:08,685
MR. BONG'S AFTER-SALES SERVICE

750
00:53:15,108 --> 00:53:16,234
Here we go.

751
00:53:20,405 --> 00:53:21,573
All done.

752
00:53:37,005 --> 00:53:39,549
DYAN EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR
AND ISLAND BACHELOR SPLIT

753
00:53:42,928 --> 00:53:44,054
Choi Gi-jun.

754
00:53:44,971 --> 00:53:47,557
Your friend here never got
to date properly

755
00:53:48,391 --> 00:53:50,894
and is getting hate comments.
Don't you feel bad for me?

756
00:53:52,270 --> 00:53:54,648
That's why I'm spending
the weekend with you.

757
00:53:55,732 --> 00:53:58,068
I'm your excuse
to skip out on family dinner, right?

758
00:54:00,654 --> 00:54:04,282
What are friends for, right?

759
00:54:08,453 --> 00:54:10,163
What's gotten you upset again?

760
00:54:12,499 --> 00:54:14,751
Hey, you need to be good to me.

761
00:54:15,710 --> 00:54:19,214
While trying to hook you up with Mr. Bong,
I've drifted apart from Ha-na.

762
00:54:20,256 --> 00:54:22,509
Were you really on my side?

763
00:54:23,927 --> 00:54:27,973
Or were you trying to look good
in front of Jeong Ha-na?

764
00:54:31,601 --> 00:54:35,397
I wonder what Cheol-hui is doing today.

765
00:54:36,022 --> 00:54:37,607
I wonder what Ha-na is doing.

766
00:54:40,860 --> 00:54:43,446
She had to help Ms. Lee yesterday,

767
00:54:43,530 --> 00:54:46,658
so she told me
she couldn't finish up with Mr. Bong.

768
00:54:47,993 --> 00:54:49,327
You don't think…

769
00:54:51,955 --> 00:54:56,084
You don't think they'll meet up
this weekend to work together, do you?

770
00:54:56,167 --> 00:54:57,293
Hey.

771
00:54:57,377 --> 00:54:58,461
What?

772
00:54:59,170 --> 00:55:00,338
They did meet up.

773
00:55:24,863 --> 00:55:26,114
Excuse me, Ha-na.

774
00:55:27,449 --> 00:55:28,950
Why are we here?

775
00:55:29,868 --> 00:55:31,911
You said you wanted to
rewrite your profile.

776
00:55:31,995 --> 00:55:34,914
Your preferences differ
depending on the books you like.

777
00:55:34,998 --> 00:55:36,291
Really?

778
00:55:37,042 --> 00:55:39,711
I guess that kind of stuff is
important these days.

779
00:55:39,794 --> 00:55:41,254
Go and choose a book you like.

780
00:55:47,427 --> 00:55:48,344
Okay.

781
00:56:06,029 --> 00:56:09,032
A PANDA'S DAY

782
00:56:09,616 --> 00:56:12,410
San-i and Ba-da would love this.

783
00:56:14,162 --> 00:56:16,456
Cheol-hui, choose a book that you like.

784
00:56:17,874 --> 00:56:19,334
What happened?

785
00:56:19,417 --> 00:56:20,752
Did you cut yourself?

786
00:56:25,757 --> 00:56:26,716
Hold on a second.

787
00:56:30,720 --> 00:56:32,847
Ba-da always puts one of these in my bag.

788
00:56:35,016 --> 00:56:36,226
I get to use it today.

789
00:56:38,061 --> 00:56:38,937
What?

790
00:56:41,106 --> 00:56:42,649
This must hurt.

791
00:56:52,075 --> 00:56:54,953
In-a, you're a really good person.

792
00:56:57,413 --> 00:56:58,873
I don't think

793
00:56:59,833 --> 00:57:01,334
we're the right match…

794
00:57:04,003 --> 00:57:07,382
for each other.

795
00:57:09,092 --> 00:57:13,388
By any chance, do you have feelings
for someone other than me?

796
00:57:16,850 --> 00:57:18,226
I think so.

797
00:57:19,644 --> 00:57:20,895
I think someone else found

798
00:57:21,896 --> 00:57:23,898
her way into my heart.

799
00:57:28,945 --> 00:57:30,155
This must hurt.

800
00:57:34,617 --> 00:57:38,288
I don't want anyone to get hurt
because of me ever again.

801
00:57:39,247 --> 00:57:40,915
Is it because…

802
00:57:42,792 --> 00:57:44,419
you have feelings for that someone?

803
00:57:48,631 --> 00:57:51,509
Yes, I think so.

804
00:57:58,099 --> 00:57:59,225
Are you okay?

805
00:58:00,477 --> 00:58:02,687
THE CUPID
WHO SHOT A GOLDEN ARROW

806
00:58:02,770 --> 00:58:05,064
Uncle, haven't you heard of Cupid?

807
00:58:05,148 --> 00:58:06,941
If his arrow hits you, you fall in love.

808
00:58:16,993 --> 00:58:20,580
It found its mark.

809
00:58:21,080 --> 00:58:22,457
Excuse me?

810
00:58:47,065 --> 00:58:50,360
PETITION TITLE - DISSOLVE
THE MARRIAGE MORALE BOOST TEAM

811
00:59:25,311 --> 00:59:27,605
We have our first couple match
to get married.

812
00:59:27,689 --> 00:59:29,065
We're connected now.

813
00:59:29,148 --> 00:59:31,484
We didn't know you'd help
with wedding preparations.

814
00:59:31,568 --> 00:59:33,361
When a man and a woman first meet,

815
00:59:33,444 --> 00:59:36,531
they begin to piece together
their tastes and hobbies like a puzzle.

816
00:59:36,614 --> 00:59:39,117
I really like houses like this one.

817
00:59:39,200 --> 00:59:40,868
- What about you?
- I like apartments.

818
00:59:42,620 --> 00:59:43,997
Where will we sleep?

819
00:59:44,080 --> 00:59:45,957
What do you mean "where will we sleep?"

820
00:59:46,040 --> 00:59:47,083
I like hotels.

821
00:59:47,166 --> 00:59:48,793
I like camping.

822
00:59:48,876 --> 00:59:51,212
You know, with a bonfire.

823
00:59:52,422 --> 00:59:54,507
I think you need to look at this.

824
00:59:54,591 --> 00:59:56,551
What is this?

825
00:59:56,634 --> 00:59:58,511
If you can't take care of this problem,

826
00:59:58,595 --> 01:00:04,017
I can't guarantee you won't end up
working at a province office, Ms. Jeong!

827
01:00:04,100 --> 01:00:05,560
You're off Mr. Bong's case.

828
01:00:05,643 --> 01:00:08,563
I think Choi Gi-jun is
taking over your case.

829
01:00:08,646 --> 01:00:11,858
If you need results
to avoid getting in trouble,

830
01:00:11,941 --> 01:00:15,361
let's get those results together, Ha-na.

831
01:00:16,738 --> 01:00:20,575
Don't you think you're moving too fast?

832
01:00:21,743 --> 01:00:26,748
