Mr. Homeless.

13
00:00:49,855 --> 00:00:52,164
What are you doing? Let's go inside.

14
00:01:27,801 --> 00:01:29,260
Here, dry yourself.

15
00:01:29,260 --> 00:01:33,301
You said you hated the rain,
so why did you let yourself get soaked?

16
00:01:40,520 --> 00:01:42,034
Madam!

17
00:01:44,193 --> 00:01:45,871
Excuse me...

18
00:01:50,589 --> 00:01:55,528
The one who was with the madam
right before the accident was him.

19
00:01:58,523 --> 00:02:01,131
Madam! Wake up!

20
00:02:01,131 --> 00:02:02,730
Madam!

21
00:02:06,187 --> 00:02:07,988
Help!

22
00:02:08,999 --> 00:02:11,172
She's dying!

23
00:02:11,172 --> 00:02:13,382
Please, someone help!

24
00:02:18,003 --> 00:02:23,137
If he was still there at the time
of the madam's accident...

25
00:02:24,430 --> 00:02:27,262
Perhaps her accident was...

26
00:02:27,262 --> 00:02:30,965
You really are a handful.

27
00:02:30,965 --> 00:02:34,561
If you fall sick, I'll be the one to suffer.

28
00:02:34,561 --> 00:02:36,436
Stop, young lady!

29
00:02:36,436 --> 00:02:38,853
I was in the middle of something important

30
00:02:38,853 --> 00:02:40,828
and you interrupted my stream of thoughts.

31
00:02:40,828 --> 00:02:42,967
On what?

32
00:02:42,967 --> 00:02:44,790
The madam's...

33
00:02:47,249 --> 00:02:48,379
Never mind.

34
00:02:48,379 --> 00:02:51,811
Why stop mid-sentence?
Don't leave me hanging.

35
00:02:51,811 --> 00:02:53,698
What is it?

36
00:02:57,205 --> 00:03:00,958
I'm not sure
if I should tell you this first.

37
00:03:00,958 --> 00:03:02,686
But I think...

38
00:03:11,578 --> 00:03:14,316
Go get changed now!

39
00:03:27,470 --> 00:03:29,170
Did he...

40
00:03:30,231 --> 00:03:32,500
really see me?

41
00:04:09,121 --> 00:04:10,657
Madam!

42
00:04:16,087 --> 00:04:17,451
Madam! Wake up!

43
00:04:17,451 --> 00:04:19,003
Madam!

44
00:04:20,703 --> 00:04:22,585
Help!

45
00:04:22,585 --> 00:04:24,599
Is no one around?

46
00:04:25,328 --> 00:04:27,527
She's dying!

47
00:04:27,527 --> 00:04:29,646
Help!

48
00:04:29,646 --> 00:04:31,136
Madam!

49
00:04:31,136 --> 00:04:32,901
Madam, get up!

50
00:04:34,557 --> 00:04:36,994
Madam, wake up!

51
00:04:38,794 --> 00:04:40,357
Madam!

52
00:04:42,063 --> 00:04:44,278
How could this happen.

53
00:04:45,772 --> 00:04:47,836
How much did he see?

54
00:05:11,468 --> 00:05:13,233
What's the matter?

55
00:05:14,464 --> 00:05:17,316
The jar my mom cherished...

56
00:05:17,316 --> 00:05:19,425
Why is it broken?

57
00:05:20,247 --> 00:05:22,478
Did you do this?

58
00:05:23,758 --> 00:05:26,120
I was out with you and just got back.

59
00:05:26,120 --> 00:05:28,229
When would I have had the time?

60
00:05:47,512 --> 00:05:51,141
Someone's been rummaging through the kitchen.

61
00:05:52,116 --> 00:05:53,729
A thief?

62
00:06:26,878 --> 00:06:30,760
Other than the broken jar,
is anything missing?

63
00:06:30,760 --> 00:06:32,225
I don't think so.

64
00:06:32,225 --> 00:06:34,761
The cash at the counter is untouched,

65
00:06:34,761 --> 00:06:37,213
and all the ingredients
are still here, right?

66
00:06:37,213 --> 00:06:38,899
That's right.

67
00:06:38,899 --> 00:06:42,464
But someone definitely
went through the kitchen.

68
00:06:42,464 --> 00:06:44,045
Really?

69
00:06:44,741 --> 00:06:49,031
By any chance, do you know
how much that broken jar is worth?

70
00:06:49,694 --> 00:06:51,830
I'm not sure.

71
00:06:51,830 --> 00:06:56,081
My mom treasured it so much
she wouldn't even let me touch it

72
00:06:56,081 --> 00:06:58,256
I'll file a report for now.

73
00:06:58,256 --> 00:07:02,172
Check again for any other missing items
and let me know.

74
00:07:03,456 --> 00:07:05,447
Thank you, detective.

75
00:07:05,447 --> 00:07:08,156
You've been through a lot.
Would you like a cup of coffee?

76
00:07:08,156 --> 00:07:09,821
No, I'm good.

77
00:07:09,821 --> 00:07:11,811
I no longer drink coffee.

78
00:07:12,673 --> 00:07:13,916
Then maybe the others...

79
00:07:13,916 --> 00:07:16,479
No.

80
00:07:16,479 --> 00:07:19,569
They all quit, too.

81
00:07:19,569 --> 00:07:23,341
I'll go upstairs and check
if anything else is missing.

82
00:07:28,331 --> 00:07:30,347
You got all the fingerprints, right?

83
00:07:30,347 --> 00:07:32,294
- Yes, sir.
- Okay.

84
00:07:33,766 --> 00:07:36,077
- Goodnight.
- Excuse me!

85
00:07:38,109 --> 00:07:40,437
What is it this time?

86
00:07:41,495 --> 00:07:45,664
Are you trying to drag up the past
and start another argument?

87
00:07:47,645 --> 00:07:50,941
I have something important to tell you.

88
00:07:51,900 --> 00:07:54,058
What could possibly be so important?

89
00:07:54,058 --> 00:07:56,475
Why are you acting so serious?

90
00:07:56,475 --> 00:07:58,783
It's about the madam.

91
00:08:00,609 --> 00:08:02,621
Not that again.

92
00:08:02,621 --> 00:08:05,688
I told you, she was alone that day.

93
00:08:05,688 --> 00:08:09,163
No, she was not alone that day.

94
00:08:10,427 --> 00:08:13,924
She had company,
and I think I know who it was.

95
00:08:47,897 --> 00:08:52,219
You said you didn't see the person's face.

96
00:08:52,219 --> 00:08:54,027
That's right.

97
00:08:54,027 --> 00:08:57,832
But I remember everything else,

98
00:08:59,495 --> 00:09:02,806
and I've found someone who matches.

99
00:09:03,752 --> 00:09:05,809
Come on.

100
00:09:05,809 --> 00:09:09,121
Without the face, it could be anyone.

101
00:09:09,121 --> 00:09:11,478
How can you identify someone
just by their body shape?

102
00:09:11,478 --> 00:09:15,486
Do not underestimate the memory
of the Transcendent Genius.

103
00:09:17,289 --> 00:09:19,117
I'm certain.

104
00:09:19,117 --> 00:09:20,794
It was him.

105
00:09:20,794 --> 00:09:23,494
Do you have any proof?

106
00:09:30,400 --> 00:09:31,623
[Mr. Lee]

107
00:09:38,162 --> 00:09:40,033
The evidence I have,

108
00:09:41,193 --> 00:09:43,364
is what I saw and heard.

109
00:09:43,997 --> 00:09:46,412
So I need your help.

110
00:09:46,412 --> 00:09:48,823
Please investigate him thoroughly.

111
00:09:48,823 --> 00:09:52,101
Find out why he met the madam
just before the accident

112
00:09:52,101 --> 00:09:55,230
and what exactly happened
on those stairs that day…

113
00:09:55,230 --> 00:09:57,017
What did you just say?

114
00:10:01,813 --> 00:10:05,634
Who did my mom meet
just before the accident?

115
00:10:07,105 --> 00:10:10,318
Well, that is…

116
00:10:16,823 --> 00:10:20,321
I asked you a question.
Who was the person my mom met?

117
00:10:39,596 --> 00:10:42,744
This has gotten out of hand.

118
00:10:42,744 --> 00:10:44,503
What should we do?

119
00:10:45,302 --> 00:10:46,551
What else?

120
00:10:46,551 --> 00:10:49,289
Detective Kang, you need to contain it again.

121
00:10:52,118 --> 00:10:55,820
A witness has come forward,
and the victim's family will take action.

122
00:10:55,820 --> 00:10:58,284
What exactly do you expect me to do?

123
00:10:58,284 --> 00:11:03,209
Believe it or not, I'm a cop.
I can't ignore the procedures,

124
00:11:03,209 --> 00:11:05,998
and keep covering for you.

125
00:11:05,998 --> 00:11:09,419
But you've been doing exactly that all this time.

126
00:11:09,419 --> 00:11:11,565
And willingly, at that.

127
00:11:13,897 --> 00:11:18,667
There's only so much
I can sweep under the rug.

128
00:11:19,560 --> 00:11:21,313
Now that it's come to this

129
00:11:21,313 --> 00:11:25,601
I have no choice but to investigate you.

130
00:11:25,601 --> 00:11:30,941
Investigate me based on the words
of someone with no clear identity?

131
00:11:33,622 --> 00:11:37,620
Even if we ignore him,
what about Bong Eun Sil?

132
00:11:37,620 --> 00:11:41,373
You really think the victim's daughter
will just let this go?

133
00:11:41,373 --> 00:11:45,888
So, you're saying she's suspecting me
just because of what he said.

134
00:11:45,888 --> 00:11:49,235
Then, all we need to do
is invalidate what she heard.

135
00:11:50,006 --> 00:11:54,244
How do we invalidate something
that she has already heard?

136
00:11:54,244 --> 00:11:56,864
Try making some sense.

137
00:12:14,689 --> 00:12:16,502
Eun Sil.

138
00:12:16,502 --> 00:12:19,356
I figured you'd come, so I waited.

139
00:12:20,508 --> 00:12:23,536
You should've called me
instead of waiting outside in the cold.

140
00:12:23,536 --> 00:12:26,114
This isn't something to talk about
over the phone.

141
00:12:27,338 --> 00:12:28,920
Let's go inside.

142
00:12:39,187 --> 00:12:41,741
Thank you so much for earlier.

143
00:12:41,741 --> 00:12:44,154
I was caught off guard
when it suddenly started raining.

144
00:12:48,071 --> 00:12:51,107
I'll buy you a new umbrella.

145
00:12:52,219 --> 00:12:56,668
I left mine in front of the restaurant,
but I can't find it anymore.

146
00:12:57,840 --> 00:13:01,298
That's not what I'm here for.

147
00:13:06,364 --> 00:13:10,823
Chef, I heard you met my mom.

148
00:13:11,656 --> 00:13:14,002
Just before her accident.

149
00:13:17,322 --> 00:13:19,238
That's true.

150
00:13:19,238 --> 00:13:23,219
I saw her that morning, just before dawn.

151
00:13:23,219 --> 00:13:25,594
Then why didn't you tell me?

152
00:13:25,594 --> 00:13:27,348
I wanted to.

153
00:13:27,348 --> 00:13:30,378
I wanted to tell you so many times, but…

154
00:13:32,792 --> 00:13:36,623
Every time I tried, that person was there.

155
00:13:36,623 --> 00:13:39,358
That person? Who?

156
00:13:41,063 --> 00:13:43,264
Oh, do you mean Mr. Homeless?

157
00:13:45,341 --> 00:13:50,705
I assume he's the one who told you
that I met your mother.

158
00:13:52,237 --> 00:13:55,066
Yes, that's right.

159
00:13:56,606 --> 00:13:58,994
He's keeping me in check.

160
00:14:00,894 --> 00:14:04,418
Why would he do that?

161
00:14:05,297 --> 00:14:08,522
Because he's afraid of the truth I know.

162
00:14:09,350 --> 00:14:13,215
He wanted to make sure
you wouldn't trust me.

163
00:14:20,719 --> 00:14:25,112
What is taking her so long?

164
00:14:37,332 --> 00:14:40,836
[Eun Sil]

165
00:14:49,738 --> 00:14:53,489
The recipient is unavailable
Please leave a message after the beep.

166
00:14:53,489 --> 00:14:55,900
A service charge may apply.

167
00:14:58,312 --> 00:15:00,717
Who is this speaking?

168
00:15:00,717 --> 00:15:03,310
Where is Lady Eun Sil?

169
00:15:03,310 --> 00:15:05,740
Call her here at once!

170
00:15:05,740 --> 00:15:06,919
Excuse me?

171
00:15:06,919 --> 00:15:10,965
[Mr. Homeless]

172
00:15:16,193 --> 00:15:17,604
Go on.

173
00:15:17,604 --> 00:15:22,929
The truth is…
your mother called for me that night.

174
00:15:22,929 --> 00:15:25,945
She said she had something important to discuss.

175
00:15:27,390 --> 00:15:29,363
At that hour?

176
00:15:30,367 --> 00:15:33,498
She seemed restless, unable to sleep

177
00:15:33,498 --> 00:15:35,481
and for good reason.

178
00:15:37,055 --> 00:15:39,997
She told me she had been scammed.

179
00:15:39,997 --> 00:15:43,271
My mom… was scammed?

180
00:15:44,250 --> 00:15:45,817
Yes.

181
00:15:46,657 --> 00:15:50,504
By the man you're working with now.

182
00:15:51,376 --> 00:15:53,468
Gyosan.

183
00:15:54,807 --> 00:15:56,831
What?

184
00:15:56,831 --> 00:15:58,605
Mr. Homeless?

185
00:16:01,428 --> 00:16:03,664
Chef, what are you trying to say?

186
00:16:03,664 --> 00:16:06,883
That man isn't the type
to do something like that.

187
00:16:06,883 --> 00:16:08,621
Then...

188
00:16:09,342 --> 00:16:13,278
Do I look like someone who would lie to you?

189
00:16:15,360 --> 00:16:17,688
That's not what I meant...

190
00:16:19,400 --> 00:16:23,431
He barely even knows how the world works
What kind of scam could he pull?

191
00:16:23,431 --> 00:16:26,094
That naïveté is exactly what
deceived your mother.

192
00:16:26,094 --> 00:16:30,615
That night, she told me

193
00:16:30,615 --> 00:16:33,793
she had helped him out of pity...

194
00:16:33,793 --> 00:16:36,287
Only to have him stab her in the back.

195
00:16:39,492 --> 00:16:44,123
Now, do you understand
why I never trusted him?

196
00:16:45,721 --> 00:16:50,656
I've been trying to warn you all along.

197
00:16:52,520 --> 00:16:54,929
You must be mistaken.

198
00:16:56,236 --> 00:17:01,261
- The Mr. Homeless, I know...
- And what exactly do you know about him?

199
00:17:03,404 --> 00:17:06,486
- Well...
- That he came from Joseon?

200
00:17:07,443 --> 00:17:10,884
That a man who supposedly
never cooked before

201
00:17:10,884 --> 00:17:14,194
can suddenly make quality dishes overnight?

202
00:17:14,194 --> 00:17:16,752
All those ridiculous lies.

203
00:17:18,120 --> 00:17:19,871
How could you...

204
00:17:20,996 --> 00:17:24,013
possibly believe them?

205
00:17:24,013 --> 00:17:26,616
It wasn't his words I believed.

206
00:17:27,613 --> 00:17:31,184
I believed in the character
he revealed through his actions.

207
00:17:31,184 --> 00:17:33,219
His character.

208
00:17:33,219 --> 00:17:36,836
Sure, your mother must have thought the same.

209
00:17:36,836 --> 00:17:40,494
And yet, she was deceived and came to me.

210
00:17:42,679 --> 00:17:47,875
That day, your mother and I
met for a brief moment.

211
00:17:49,926 --> 00:17:51,902
And I...

212
00:17:51,902 --> 00:17:54,654
I regret that more than anything.

213
00:17:55,608 --> 00:18:00,630
If I had just walked her home that night...

214
00:18:03,536 --> 00:18:06,154
this accident wouldn't have happened.

215
00:18:08,787 --> 00:18:11,646
I understand what you're saying,

216
00:18:12,339 --> 00:18:13,657
but I need to confirm it myself.

217
00:18:13,657 --> 00:18:15,341
Eun Sil.

218
00:18:17,332 --> 00:18:22,187
Don't you find all of this suspicious?

219
00:18:22,187 --> 00:18:25,880
That man, Gyosan was there
when your mother had her accident.

220
00:18:25,880 --> 00:18:29,305
Do you think that's just a coincidence?

221
00:18:31,952 --> 00:18:34,698
But what were you doing there last night?

222
00:18:35,618 --> 00:18:38,299
Didn't we part ways
in front of Changdeokgung?

223
00:18:38,299 --> 00:18:42,285
I was merely looking around
the neighborhood...

224
00:18:45,510 --> 00:18:47,402
What if he was involved in your mother's accident?

225
00:18:47,402 --> 00:18:49,311
That's enough!

226
00:18:50,963 --> 00:18:53,270
I don't want to hear it anymore.

227
00:18:57,947 --> 00:19:00,874
I have no idea what's going on.

228
00:19:02,419 --> 00:19:05,036
You must be confused.

229
00:19:05,036 --> 00:19:06,808
I understand.

230
00:19:07,415 --> 00:19:10,966
If you can't trust me...

231
00:19:11,789 --> 00:19:14,538
Then ask someone else.

232
00:19:14,538 --> 00:19:16,536
For example...

233
00:19:19,380 --> 00:19:22,377
The police.

234
00:19:22,377 --> 00:19:25,829
Please leave a message after the beep...

235
00:19:25,829 --> 00:19:28,706
It's the other lady again.

236
00:19:28,706 --> 00:19:30,859
She says the same thing every time!

237
00:19:36,421 --> 00:19:38,312
Young lady!

238
00:19:38,312 --> 00:19:41,710
Where have you been this late at night?

239
00:19:41,710 --> 00:19:43,657
Do you know how worried I was?

240
00:19:43,657 --> 00:19:46,131
You were worried about me?

241
00:19:46,131 --> 00:19:48,591
Of course, I was.

242
00:19:49,969 --> 00:19:52,727
Why didn't you answer your phone?

243
00:19:52,727 --> 00:19:55,736
You told me to always keep this with me
and pick up when you call.

244
00:19:55,736 --> 00:19:57,452
Mister.

245
00:19:58,747 --> 00:20:01,356
Are you hiding anything from me?

246
00:20:01,356 --> 00:20:04,405
What are you talking about all of a sudden?

247
00:20:04,405 --> 00:20:06,735
Something about my mother.

248
00:20:08,490 --> 00:20:12,470
Is there really nothing you need to tell me?

249
00:20:14,042 --> 00:20:18,859
She's better off not knowing
until I'm certain.

250
00:20:22,883 --> 00:20:24,782
No.

251
00:20:27,004 --> 00:20:29,690
The day my mom had her accident…

252
00:20:29,690 --> 00:20:32,288
Why were you there?

253
00:20:33,230 --> 00:20:35,388
That's...

254
00:20:35,388 --> 00:20:37,804
Give me an honest answer.

255
00:20:37,804 --> 00:20:41,294
Fine, I'll tell you the truth.

256
00:20:41,294 --> 00:20:45,225
That night, I returned to that place
because I was trying to go back to Joseon.

257
00:20:45,225 --> 00:20:49,215
Enough with that nonsense about Joseon!

258
00:20:50,147 --> 00:20:53,354
Give me something I can actually believe!

259
00:20:53,354 --> 00:20:54,611
Tell me why!

260
00:20:54,611 --> 00:20:57,381
Why were you there, at that time,
at that exact place?

261
00:20:57,381 --> 00:20:59,717
Give me a reason that makes sense!

262
00:20:59,717 --> 00:21:02,392
Everything I've told you is the truth!

263
00:21:04,129 --> 00:21:06,221
Wait...

264
00:21:06,221 --> 00:21:08,160
Young lady,

265
00:21:09,183 --> 00:21:11,656
are you doubting me?

266
00:21:12,709 --> 00:21:15,398
I want to believe you.

267
00:21:16,340 --> 00:21:19,177
So give me an answer I can believe.

268
00:21:21,073 --> 00:21:25,903
If you refuse to accept the truth...

269
00:21:27,824 --> 00:21:30,531
then there's nothing more I can say.

270
00:21:58,733 --> 00:22:00,278
Great! Isn't this fun?

271
00:22:00,278 --> 00:22:03,420
You need to match the line.

272
00:22:04,165 --> 00:22:05,742
Heo's Diner, let's make it big!

273
00:22:05,742 --> 00:22:07,510
Heo's Diner, let's make it big!

274
00:22:07,510 --> 00:22:10,151
Heo's Diner, let's go!

275
00:22:10,151 --> 00:22:12,394
Heo's Diner, let's go!

276
00:22:13,875 --> 00:22:17,017
Everything I saw was a lie?

277
00:22:20,251 --> 00:22:22,333
That can't be true.

278
00:23:08,374 --> 00:23:10,256
Where did he go?

279
00:23:14,519 --> 00:23:16,165
[Mr. Homeless]

280
00:23:46,082 --> 00:23:47,962
Help!

281
00:23:47,962 --> 00:23:49,745
Is no one around?

282
00:23:49,745 --> 00:23:51,513
I need solid proof.

283
00:23:51,513 --> 00:23:55,794
Only then can I reveal the culprit
and clear the young lady's misunderstanding.

284
00:23:56,686 --> 00:24:00,463
But too much time has passed,
and there were no witnesses…

285
00:24:01,104 --> 00:24:03,184
What should I do?

286
00:24:16,232 --> 00:24:19,836
Young lady, this is the first time
you've called me first.

287
00:24:19,836 --> 00:24:21,939
Did you sleep well?

288
00:24:21,939 --> 00:24:25,048
- About yesterday, we both misunderstood.
- Where are you?

289
00:24:26,420 --> 00:24:28,539
I'm out to find...

290
00:24:29,478 --> 00:24:31,881
I'm out to buy groceries.

291
00:24:31,881 --> 00:24:33,532
You're at the market?

292
00:24:33,532 --> 00:24:34,891
Yes.

293
00:24:34,891 --> 00:24:38,903
I'll take care of it myself,
so you should rest a little longer.

294
00:24:45,072 --> 00:24:47,431
So… you're at the market right now?

295
00:24:50,099 --> 00:24:51,831
I understand.

296
00:24:59,969 --> 00:25:01,699
Detective Kang.

297
00:25:07,021 --> 00:25:08,688
Bong Eun Sil.

298
00:25:09,629 --> 00:25:13,173
I'm sorry for dropping by so early…

299
00:25:15,981 --> 00:25:20,518
So, you're saying she's suspecting me
just because of what he said.

300
00:25:20,518 --> 00:25:23,574
Then, all we need to do
is invalidate what she heard.

301
00:25:23,574 --> 00:25:27,847
How do we invalidate something
that she has already heard?

302
00:25:27,847 --> 00:25:30,420
Try making some sense.

303
00:25:37,897 --> 00:25:41,758
Before long, Bong Eun Sil will come to you

304
00:25:41,758 --> 00:25:44,100
asking about that man, Gyosan.

305
00:25:44,100 --> 00:25:49,119
When that happens, Detective Kang,
just handle it the right way.

306
00:25:50,341 --> 00:25:53,116
No need to apologize.

307
00:25:53,116 --> 00:25:55,553
Tell me what's on your mind.

308
00:25:55,553 --> 00:25:59,364
Today's guest on Talk Lounge is someone
at the center of all the buzz lately.

309
00:25:59,364 --> 00:26:04,048
From a beloved CF fairy to a rising actress,
please welcome Jung Mi Sol!

310
00:26:04,048 --> 00:26:08,150
Hello, everyone. I'm actress Jung Mi Sol.

311
00:26:08,150 --> 00:26:12,203
The studio already feels
so much brighter with you here!

312
00:26:12,203 --> 00:26:13,943
Oh no, already?

313
00:26:13,943 --> 00:26:17,441
What if it reaches dangerous levels
by the time we're done?

314
00:26:20,480 --> 00:26:22,003
You're as cheerful as ever.

315
00:26:22,003 --> 00:26:25,429
But I heard you went through
a tough time recently.

316
00:26:25,429 --> 00:26:29,679
Yes, because of the eating disorder
I was struggling with.

317
00:26:29,679 --> 00:26:33,406
There were some misunderstandings,
and I ended up worrying a lot of people.

318
00:26:33,406 --> 00:26:37,433
First and foremost,
I want to sincerely apologize for that.

319
00:26:37,433 --> 00:26:40,082
But I'm doing so much better now

320
00:26:40,082 --> 00:26:42,949
I even have a go-to restaurant.

321
00:26:54,948 --> 00:26:58,027
I wish it were all just a misunderstanding.

322
00:27:03,250 --> 00:27:05,026
[Detective Kang Jin Su]

323
00:27:06,334 --> 00:27:08,075
Yes, detective.

324
00:27:08,075 --> 00:27:09,205
Bong Eun Sil?

325
00:27:09,205 --> 00:27:12,825
I looked into the identity you asked about.

326
00:27:12,825 --> 00:27:14,632
Yes, please go on.

327
00:27:14,632 --> 00:27:17,844
Just so you know,
sharing this information is illegal.

328
00:27:17,844 --> 00:27:21,091
So you cannot say
that you heard this from me

329
00:27:21,091 --> 00:27:23,946
I swear, I won't say a word.

330
00:27:25,015 --> 00:27:27,160
That man has quite the record.

331
00:27:27,160 --> 00:27:30,962
Fourteen prior convictions, all for fraud.

332
00:27:37,773 --> 00:27:40,752
Young lady, what are you doing out here?

333
00:27:40,752 --> 00:27:42,406
Let's go inside.

334
00:28:00,992 --> 00:28:02,633
Detective Kang.

335
00:28:03,593 --> 00:28:04,883
Yes?

336
00:28:04,883 --> 00:28:07,264
What are you doing here?

337
00:28:07,264 --> 00:28:08,705
Just looking for something real quick.

338
00:28:08,705 --> 00:28:11,964
Where did I put my phone? Jeez...

339
00:28:16,387 --> 00:28:18,620
Oh, it's in my hand.

340
00:28:18,620 --> 00:28:21,360
Pull yourself together.

341
00:28:21,360 --> 00:28:23,128
You've been acting strange lately.

342
00:28:23,128 --> 00:28:25,205
There's nothing to be strange about.

343
00:28:25,205 --> 00:28:26,954
Let's just go.

344
00:28:29,506 --> 00:28:32,418
When I was young,
so many people adored me

345
00:28:32,418 --> 00:28:34,899
for being cute and charming

346
00:28:34,899 --> 00:28:36,672
I think I felt pressured

347
00:28:36,672 --> 00:28:40,137
to maintain that image

348
00:28:40,137 --> 00:28:42,704
for as long as possible.

349
00:28:42,704 --> 00:28:44,953
As a result, whenever I ate something

350
00:28:44,953 --> 00:28:47,448
I'd think, "What if I lose this look?"

351
00:28:47,448 --> 00:28:50,227
"What if people no longer like me?"

352
00:28:50,227 --> 00:28:53,602
That fear… it got to me.

353
00:28:53,602 --> 00:28:57,933
And before I knew it, I was caught
in a cycle of eating and purging...

354
00:28:57,933 --> 00:28:59,089
Cut!

355
00:28:59,089 --> 00:29:01,493
Let's take a short break.

356
00:29:01,493 --> 00:29:02,957
Well done.

357
00:29:04,190 --> 00:29:05,607
Jung Mi Sol.

358
00:29:05,607 --> 00:29:07,125
The content is great

359
00:29:07,125 --> 00:29:10,230
but you're saying it too flatly.

360
00:29:10,230 --> 00:29:13,678
Try to bring out more feeling, okay?

361
00:29:13,678 --> 00:29:16,964
Huh? How do I…?

362
00:29:16,964 --> 00:29:19,356
Make the audience feel
the struggles of a child model.

363
00:29:19,356 --> 00:29:22,640
Get emotional, maybe even shed a few tears.

364
00:29:22,640 --> 00:29:26,275
We need viewers to connect with you.

365
00:29:26,275 --> 00:29:27,763
Got it?

366
00:29:28,663 --> 00:29:30,303
Yes, okay.

367
00:29:30,303 --> 00:29:31,832
Okay, let's go again.

368
00:29:31,832 --> 00:29:33,494
You can do this!

369
00:29:34,786 --> 00:29:36,145
Let's begin.

370
00:29:36,145 --> 00:29:38,292
Okay, cue!

371
00:29:40,104 --> 00:29:43,030
I think I felt a lot of pressure

372
00:29:43,030 --> 00:29:48,359
to maintain my childhood image
for as long as possible…

373
00:29:48,359 --> 00:29:50,236
So...

374
00:29:54,047 --> 00:29:56,908
Whenever I ate something, I'd...

375
00:30:02,749 --> 00:30:05,697
I'd be afraid...

376
00:30:08,219 --> 00:30:10,292
Darn it.

377
00:30:11,019 --> 00:30:12,164
I quit!

378
00:30:12,164 --> 00:30:15,315
Why do I have to act
when I'm talking about my own story?!

379
00:30:15,315 --> 00:30:16,381
Seriously!

380
00:30:16,381 --> 00:30:19,518
Even back then, I never cried about it.
So why should I now?!

381
00:30:19,518 --> 00:30:21,440
Let's go.

382
00:30:22,862 --> 00:30:25,867
I'm really sorry! Really sorry!

383
00:30:37,892 --> 00:30:41,216
We're here to eat Are you open?

384
00:30:43,199 --> 00:30:44,266
Have a seat.

385
00:30:44,266 --> 00:30:45,486
Thank you.

386
00:30:45,486 --> 00:30:47,255
Sit.

387
00:30:58,751 --> 00:31:01,858
- Hey, mister.
- Mae Chang.

388
00:31:01,858 --> 00:31:04,432
Excuse me, can we get two set menus?

389
00:31:04,432 --> 00:31:05,916
Of course.

390
00:31:05,916 --> 00:31:07,764
Please wait a moment.

391
00:31:09,450 --> 00:31:11,870
Where's Eun Sil?

392
00:31:11,870 --> 00:31:14,582
Why is she making him do all the hard work?

393
00:31:14,582 --> 00:31:16,455
Could we get some more side dishes?

394
00:31:16,455 --> 00:31:18,601
Side dish refills are self-serve.

395
00:31:33,550 --> 00:31:35,989
Here, I'll serve the food.

396
00:31:35,989 --> 00:31:37,433
You stay in the kitchen.

397
00:31:37,433 --> 00:31:39,853
At this rate, everyone's going to leave.

398
00:31:39,853 --> 00:31:42,278
But you're also a customer.
I couldn't possibly...

399
00:31:42,278 --> 00:31:46,101
I'll just ask Eun Sil to pay me,
so don't worry.

400
00:31:47,075 --> 00:31:49,182
Very well, then.

401
00:31:54,013 --> 00:31:57,031
- Mi Sol, you're so pretty.
- Thank you.

402
00:31:57,031 --> 00:31:59,417
- I'm your fan.
- Enjoy.

403
00:31:59,417 --> 00:32:01,380
Thank you.

404
00:32:07,781 --> 00:32:09,700
Chef Lee.

405
00:32:12,932 --> 00:32:15,399
You were right about everything.

406
00:32:16,421 --> 00:32:18,461
That man...

407
00:32:19,191 --> 00:32:21,226
He was...

408
00:32:23,795 --> 00:32:25,977
You must be in shock.

409
00:32:26,809 --> 00:32:29,953
Sit down, take a breath,
and tell me everything.

410
00:32:37,721 --> 00:32:40,706
Why didn't I think to check sooner?

411
00:32:40,706 --> 00:32:45,843
Why did I just laugh off
all the strange things he said?

412
00:32:48,086 --> 00:32:49,800
Don't blame yourself.

413
00:32:49,800 --> 00:32:52,090
When people like him
set their minds to deception

414
00:32:52,090 --> 00:32:54,312
it's almost impossible not to fall for it.

415
00:32:56,259 --> 00:32:58,960
This isn't your fault, Eun Sil.

416
00:32:58,960 --> 00:33:04,432
Did he really do that to my mom?

417
00:33:04,432 --> 00:33:07,462
Did he really try to hurt her?

418
00:33:09,860 --> 00:33:12,380
That's how I see it.

419
00:33:13,219 --> 00:33:15,960
He's a very dangerous man.

420
00:33:15,960 --> 00:33:20,783
You should avoid being alone with him for now.

421
00:33:21,536 --> 00:33:24,033
But it doesn't make sense.

422
00:33:25,300 --> 00:33:28,607
If he really did that to my mom,

423
00:33:28,607 --> 00:33:31,226
why didn't he run? Why is he still here...

424
00:33:31,226 --> 00:33:34,424
working at our restaurant?

425
00:33:35,271 --> 00:33:36,996
I don't know...

426
00:33:38,624 --> 00:33:44,698
But do you remember the day you came here,
saying you wanted to sell the diner?

427
00:33:45,983 --> 00:33:47,756
Yes.

428
00:33:47,756 --> 00:33:49,363
But he stopped me...

429
00:33:49,363 --> 00:33:51,875
Yes, so it wasn't concluded.

430
00:33:52,502 --> 00:33:56,786
Back then, he said something like this...

431
00:33:58,242 --> 00:34:02,637
It's not a diner, it's "Heo's Diner".

432
00:34:02,637 --> 00:34:04,723
Stay out of this, mister.

433
00:34:04,723 --> 00:34:06,509
The diner is my business to handle.

434
00:34:06,509 --> 00:34:09,645
Excuse me, it's not just a diner.

435
00:34:11,609 --> 00:34:13,708
It's "Heo's Diner".

436
00:34:15,452 --> 00:34:19,566
And since the diner bears my name
and I run the kitchen as suksu,

437
00:34:19,566 --> 00:34:21,657
I have a say in this.

438
00:34:21,657 --> 00:34:23,889
Then, he...

439
00:34:24,537 --> 00:34:27,186
He wasn't trying to protect the diner.

440
00:34:27,186 --> 00:34:30,655
He was trying to take it for himself.

441
00:34:31,442 --> 00:34:34,091
I had no idea.

442
00:34:34,091 --> 00:34:37,564
I went and named the diner after him.

443
00:34:38,297 --> 00:34:40,989
At least you know now.

444
00:34:45,875 --> 00:34:48,044
I'll help you.

445
00:34:50,744 --> 00:34:53,112
Thank you, Chef Lee.

446
00:34:58,127 --> 00:35:00,069
Ugh, why is this so exhausting?

447
00:35:00,069 --> 00:35:02,099
I'll pass out at this rate.

448
00:35:08,341 --> 00:35:11,510
I'm sorry, today's service is over.

449
00:35:12,134 --> 00:35:13,333
What are you saying?

450
00:35:13,333 --> 00:35:15,487
There's still food left.
How can you just close up?

451
00:35:15,487 --> 00:35:18,195
If Eun Sil finds out, she'll be furious.

452
00:35:18,195 --> 00:35:21,866
She skipped work today,
so who is she to get mad?

453
00:35:21,866 --> 00:35:24,596
Anyway, I can't do this any further.

454
00:35:25,510 --> 00:35:27,186
I guess there's no other choice.

455
00:35:27,186 --> 00:35:30,216
I suppose we'll have to call it a day early.

456
00:35:30,890 --> 00:35:33,829
Apologies, today's service is over.

457
00:35:36,958 --> 00:35:40,048
It's a bit late, but let's eat.

458
00:35:40,048 --> 00:35:43,455
I was so busy that I forgot how hungry I was.

459
00:35:43,455 --> 00:35:45,749
Seriously, you're the best.

460
00:35:52,439 --> 00:35:54,917
By the way, do you know where Eun Sil went?

461
00:35:57,739 --> 00:35:59,914
It seems I made Lady Eun Sil
hear something unnecessary yesterday

462
00:35:59,914 --> 00:36:03,375
and it's been weighing heavily on her mind.

463
00:36:03,375 --> 00:36:05,182
You two fought again?

464
00:36:05,182 --> 00:36:08,042
You're like a couple of kids.

465
00:36:08,042 --> 00:36:10,514
It wasn't a fight...

466
00:36:18,305 --> 00:36:19,898
What's going on?

467
00:36:20,948 --> 00:36:22,769
Should I follow him?

468
00:36:23,698 --> 00:36:26,244
I need to talk to him

469
00:36:26,244 --> 00:36:27,883
and find out what he really wants.

470
00:36:27,883 --> 00:36:30,242
I told you, he's dangerous.

471
00:36:30,242 --> 00:36:33,143
If you insist on seeing him,
take me with you.

472
00:36:33,143 --> 00:36:35,068
Young lady.

473
00:36:37,649 --> 00:36:41,023
Why are you with this man?

474
00:36:41,023 --> 00:36:43,333
"This man?"

475
00:36:43,333 --> 00:36:47,233
Just yesterday, you were clinging to me,
calling me "Gwansong".

476
00:36:47,233 --> 00:36:50,917
Now, your whole attitude
has changed overnight.

477
00:36:51,586 --> 00:36:54,777
I know what you've done to the madam.

478
00:36:54,777 --> 00:36:58,533
I will no longer call you a friend.

479
00:36:58,533 --> 00:37:01,485
Young lady, come with me.

480
00:37:01,485 --> 00:37:03,761
This man is dishonest.

481
00:37:06,731 --> 00:37:08,985
The one I can't trust is you.

482
00:37:08,985 --> 00:37:10,264
What are you saying…?

483
00:37:10,264 --> 00:37:12,671
Who are you, really?

484
00:37:12,671 --> 00:37:14,276
Tell me the truth.

485
00:37:14,276 --> 00:37:17,144
You approached me and my mom
to deceive us, didn't you?

486
00:37:17,144 --> 00:37:19,175
Deceive you?

487
00:37:19,175 --> 00:37:23,048
I have never lied to you or your mother.

488
00:37:23,818 --> 00:37:26,113
Why are you saying this all of a sudden?

489
00:37:26,113 --> 00:37:28,813
What have you done to my mom?

490
00:37:29,568 --> 00:37:32,130
And after everything, why are you still here?
Why are you still at the diner?

491
00:37:32,130 --> 00:37:34,056
What do you want from me?

492
00:37:34,056 --> 00:37:36,220
I have no idea why you are doing this.

493
00:37:37,803 --> 00:37:39,508
You!

494
00:37:39,508 --> 00:37:41,902
You've been manipulating her!

495
00:37:41,902 --> 00:37:44,347
You were the one who harmed her mother!

496
00:37:45,779 --> 00:37:49,192
It's not worth listening to him anymore.

497
00:37:49,192 --> 00:37:53,939
Make sure he never sets foot
in your mother's diner again.

498
00:37:55,070 --> 00:37:56,709
Mister.

499
00:37:59,894 --> 00:38:02,546
Please leave our diner.

500
00:38:02,546 --> 00:38:06,319
Young lady, you can't let him fool you.

501
00:38:07,153 --> 00:38:09,278
Let's talk, just the two of us.

502
00:38:10,387 --> 00:38:13,269
Eun Sil has made her decision.

503
00:38:14,046 --> 00:38:16,785
So, leave the diner.

504
00:38:19,401 --> 00:38:21,209
How dare you!

505
00:38:21,209 --> 00:38:24,080
Face me fairly and fight me head-on!

506
00:38:24,080 --> 00:38:27,012
Don't hide behind her and twist the truth!

507
00:38:27,012 --> 00:38:30,992
Are you saying he is plotting something
against them?

508
00:38:37,236 --> 00:38:38,523
It's my fault.

509
00:38:38,523 --> 00:38:42,026
I rejected his offer, and now my friends...

510
00:38:43,399 --> 00:38:45,341
Mister!

511
00:38:46,792 --> 00:38:49,097
What is all this about?

512
00:38:49,097 --> 00:38:51,265
Eun Sil, why are you treating him like this?

513
00:38:51,265 --> 00:38:56,332
After everything he's done for this place,
you're just kicking him out?

514
00:38:58,204 --> 00:39:00,352
You don't know anything, Mi Sol.

515
00:39:01,216 --> 00:39:02,902
Stay out of this.

516
00:39:02,902 --> 00:39:05,340
I'm really disappointed in you.

517
00:39:07,017 --> 00:39:08,617
Mister, let's go.

518
00:39:08,617 --> 00:39:10,550
I'll find you another restaurant.

519
00:39:10,550 --> 00:39:13,088
You don't need to cling to
this second-rate diner.

520
00:39:22,440 --> 00:39:26,274
Make yourself at home.

521
00:39:27,144 --> 00:39:29,115
Thank you.

522
00:39:29,115 --> 00:39:31,245
Come sit over here.

523
00:39:32,284 --> 00:39:34,631
How are you feeling?

524
00:39:36,929 --> 00:39:39,347
I'm feeling much better.

525
00:39:39,347 --> 00:39:41,200
Thanks to you.

526
00:39:42,687 --> 00:39:45,293
This whole thing is making me so mad.

527
00:39:45,293 --> 00:39:48,910
Why is Eun Sil even siding with
that smug jerk, Lee Hyuk?

528
00:39:51,764 --> 00:39:54,732
People like him aren't worth
getting upset over.

529
00:39:54,732 --> 00:39:56,869
Just forget about it.

530
00:40:00,105 --> 00:40:02,054
Anyway, get some rest.

531
00:40:14,425 --> 00:40:17,261
No, he would never.

532
00:40:17,261 --> 00:40:21,792
But I saw it with my own eyes.

533
00:40:21,792 --> 00:40:24,467
The letter written in his own hand.

534
00:40:25,328 --> 00:40:28,303
Is this a piece of memory I had lost?

535
00:40:29,004 --> 00:40:34,412
What exactly happened
to me and my friends?

536
00:40:51,907 --> 00:40:53,594
Lady Eun Sil.

537
00:40:56,332 --> 00:40:58,153
Taste this.

538
00:41:14,936 --> 00:41:16,705
Did you sleep well?

539
00:41:43,921 --> 00:41:46,557
Mister, sit here for a second.

540
00:41:58,948 --> 00:42:01,815
- Why am I the only one having a hard time?
- Hilarious, right?

541
00:42:01,815 --> 00:42:05,892
Everyone laughs,
while watching my wooden acting.

542
00:42:09,019 --> 00:42:11,349
Come on, lighten up a little.

543
00:42:11,349 --> 00:42:14,596
Being gloomy doesn't suit you at all.

544
00:42:14,596 --> 00:42:17,832
But what does it mean to act like wood?

545
00:42:17,832 --> 00:42:21,831
Acting stiff like wood.

546
00:42:21,831 --> 00:42:24,494
It means my acting is terrible.

547
00:42:26,322 --> 00:42:29,828
I kept trying to become an actress

548
00:42:29,828 --> 00:42:31,968
but I was always just a joke to people.

549
00:42:31,968 --> 00:42:34,994
I don't see what's so funny about this.

550
00:42:36,607 --> 00:42:39,985
Mocking you is not amusing at all.

551
00:42:39,985 --> 00:42:43,466
You really know how to say
the right things, don't you?

552
00:42:44,855 --> 00:42:47,944
But they're right, my acting is wooden.

553
00:42:48,644 --> 00:42:52,775
I don't really understand
what feeling sad really is.

554
00:42:52,775 --> 00:42:54,892
That's why I'll never make it as an actress.

555
00:42:55,792 --> 00:42:58,282
That's not true.

556
00:42:58,282 --> 00:43:01,203
You are a gifted artist, Mae Chang.

557
00:43:01,203 --> 00:43:08,315
The Mae Chang I knew was brilliant
in poetry, in music, in every instrument.

558
00:43:08,315 --> 00:43:12,488
Was she really that incredible?

559
00:43:12,488 --> 00:43:14,702
Yes.

560
00:43:14,702 --> 00:43:18,843
I was a huge fan of her talent.

561
00:43:20,662 --> 00:43:23,362
Did she resemble me that much?

562
00:43:23,362 --> 00:43:26,544
You resemble her so much.
Almost as if you are the same person.

563
00:43:26,544 --> 00:43:29,645
That's not exactly common, you know?

564
00:43:29,645 --> 00:43:34,281
Anyway, my name is Jung Mi Sol.

565
00:43:34,912 --> 00:43:38,560
Jung Mi Sol doesn't have any of those talents.

566
00:43:38,560 --> 00:43:40,695
Take my word,

567
00:43:40,695 --> 00:43:42,500
Mae Chang.

568
00:43:42,500 --> 00:43:46,330
No, Jung Mi Sol...

569
00:43:46,330 --> 00:43:48,958
is an artist with a gifted talent.

570
00:44:19,864 --> 00:44:22,640
Even the most beautiful melodies…

571
00:44:23,599 --> 00:44:26,881
If there is no one to hear them

572
00:44:26,881 --> 00:44:31,773
they are no different from
the fleeting whispers of the wind.

573
00:44:32,787 --> 00:44:35,126
My Lord, Gyosan.

574
00:44:42,611 --> 00:44:46,472
My Lady, terrible news!

575
00:44:54,340 --> 00:44:57,384
Stop! Stop!

576
00:44:57,384 --> 00:45:00,441
Please stop.

577
00:45:01,162 --> 00:45:04,110
I'll confess everything!

578
00:45:04,110 --> 00:45:07,189
Please stop.

579
00:45:18,509 --> 00:45:22,732
So, do you finally remember?

580
00:45:25,196 --> 00:45:28,496
Do you recall the crime
you and your men have committed?

581
00:45:29,731 --> 00:45:31,606
I...

582
00:45:32,929 --> 00:45:36,382
I have committed treason.

583
00:45:37,510 --> 00:45:40,136
I defied the King

584
00:45:40,136 --> 00:45:45,147
and I conspired to place
Prince Yeongchang on the throne.

585
00:45:45,854 --> 00:45:48,693
I am guilty of high treason.

586
00:45:48,693 --> 00:45:51,104
So please.

587
00:45:51,104 --> 00:45:54,458
Just end my life.

588
00:45:56,759 --> 00:45:59,763
The criminal has confessed.

589
00:45:59,763 --> 00:46:02,519
For the crime of treason

590
00:46:02,519 --> 00:46:05,185
he shall face the severest punishment.

591
00:46:08,345 --> 00:46:10,701
On the coming new moon...

592
00:46:13,147 --> 00:46:16,046
carry out their execution.

593
00:46:16,046 --> 00:46:17,886
- Yes, Your Excellency!
- Yes, Your Excellency!

594
00:46:28,875 --> 00:46:30,824
I have to go.

595
00:46:32,190 --> 00:46:34,115
Go where?

596
00:46:34,115 --> 00:46:36,170
Gwansong.

597
00:46:36,170 --> 00:46:40,508
No, Lee Hyuk is a dangerous man.

598
00:46:40,508 --> 00:46:43,530
I can't let Lady Eun Sil stay by his side.

599
00:46:44,364 --> 00:46:47,401
She made her choice.

600
00:46:47,401 --> 00:46:50,594
It's her life. Let her deal with it.

601
00:46:50,594 --> 00:46:52,554
I have to go.

602
00:46:55,173 --> 00:46:59,838
You're not even in good shape.
Rest today and go tomorrow.

603
00:46:59,838 --> 00:47:04,158
If I wait and something happens to her...

604
00:47:04,158 --> 00:47:06,990
I won't be able to live with myself.

605
00:47:06,990 --> 00:47:09,230
Thank you for everything.

606
00:47:11,286 --> 00:47:13,473
Fine.

607
00:47:13,473 --> 00:47:15,824
I'll take you there.

608
00:47:19,685 --> 00:47:21,619
Mom, I'm here.

609
00:47:23,410 --> 00:47:25,903
Chef Lee is here with me, too.

610
00:47:31,349 --> 00:47:35,389
I heard everything about Mr. Homeless.

611
00:47:38,477 --> 00:47:41,399
I can't believe I was so clueless…

612
00:47:41,399 --> 00:47:45,228
Thinking he was protecting our diner,
I was grateful to him.

613
00:47:46,809 --> 00:47:49,013
I feel so stupid.

614
00:47:53,616 --> 00:47:56,300
But thanks to Chef Lee

615
00:47:56,300 --> 00:47:59,198
at least I know the truth now.

616
00:47:59,817 --> 00:48:03,555
I kicked him out of the diner.

617
00:48:03,555 --> 00:48:08,325
And I'll make sure he pays
for what he did to you.

618
00:48:12,642 --> 00:48:15,019
I'm going to talk to the nurse for a bit.

619
00:48:15,019 --> 00:48:18,282
That man might try to come see my mom again.

620
00:48:18,282 --> 00:48:21,135
So I need to warn them.

621
00:48:21,135 --> 00:48:24,723
Okay, I'll wait here.

622
00:48:24,723 --> 00:48:26,249
Okay.

623
00:48:28,178 --> 00:48:30,486
Mom, I'll be back.

624
00:48:42,196 --> 00:48:45,253
And you don't know where he went?

625
00:48:56,598 --> 00:48:58,102
Yes.

626
00:48:58,102 --> 00:48:59,898
I understand.

627
00:48:59,898 --> 00:49:01,598
Yes.

628
00:49:02,765 --> 00:49:05,040
Is she not at home?

629
00:49:05,040 --> 00:49:09,270
I called the restaurant,
but they said Lee Hyuk is out.

630
00:49:09,270 --> 00:49:11,946
Looks like they went somewhere together.

631
00:49:15,545 --> 00:49:18,191
I hope nothing bad happens…

632
00:49:18,191 --> 00:49:21,940
Let's just go back, mister.
We don't even know when they'll return.

633
00:49:23,388 --> 00:49:28,579
No, I have someone else I need to meet.
You should head home, Mae Chang.

634
00:49:28,579 --> 00:49:30,296
Thank you.

635
00:49:32,780 --> 00:49:34,714
And for the clothes, too.

636
00:49:38,682 --> 00:49:40,920
[Inspector Kim Gap Su's Special Promotion
All staff at Seonbuk Police Station.]

637
00:49:40,920 --> 00:49:43,291
Congratulations, inspector!

638
00:50:01,670 --> 00:50:03,851
You there, officer!

639
00:50:03,851 --> 00:50:05,636
What?

640
00:50:06,794 --> 00:50:09,592
How did you know I was here?

641
00:50:09,592 --> 00:50:12,269
I'm come from the police station.

642
00:50:12,269 --> 00:50:15,223
They said you were in this area,
so I searched everywhere.

643
00:50:17,562 --> 00:50:19,578
Let's talk outside.

644
00:50:20,185 --> 00:50:22,889
How is the investigation on Lee Hyuk going?

645
00:50:22,889 --> 00:50:25,027
You can't afford to waste any more time.

646
00:50:25,027 --> 00:50:30,135
That man not only harmed the diner's madam,
but now he's targeting Eun Sil!

647
00:50:30,135 --> 00:50:33,194
Why haven't I heard any updates?

648
00:50:33,194 --> 00:50:35,515
Hey, Kang.

649
00:50:35,515 --> 00:50:37,631
What's going on?

650
00:50:37,631 --> 00:50:40,569
It's nothing.

651
00:50:41,775 --> 00:50:43,567
Follow me.

652
00:50:45,516 --> 00:50:46,794
Where are you going?

653
00:50:46,794 --> 00:50:48,612
Hey, officer!

654
00:50:49,360 --> 00:50:51,532
You're doing this to me on purpose, aren't you?

655
00:50:51,532 --> 00:50:55,940
You deliberately came to a police gathering
to spout that nonsense, didn't you?

656
00:50:55,940 --> 00:50:59,672
I only spoke the truth,
so why are you so upset?

657
00:51:00,385 --> 00:51:04,795
I've got enough on my plate as it is!

658
00:51:04,795 --> 00:51:06,989
I've made a formal request for an investigation.

659
00:51:06,989 --> 00:51:10,108
You need to reveal the truth
about Lee Hyuk's crimes.

660
00:51:10,108 --> 00:51:13,213
- We have no time to lose.
- Reveal what, exactly?

661
00:51:13,213 --> 00:51:15,674
You are the suspect!

662
00:51:16,486 --> 00:51:17,657
What did you say?

663
00:51:17,657 --> 00:51:22,780
Bong Eun Sil thinks you were the one
who hurt her mother!

664
00:51:22,780 --> 00:51:25,381
How would you know that?

665
00:51:25,381 --> 00:51:28,177
Because I'm the one
who's supposed to arrest you.

666
00:51:28,177 --> 00:51:31,165
But if you go down, I go down with you.

667
00:51:33,272 --> 00:51:36,316
Ever since I helped you in the beginning,
letting an unidentified person walk free

668
00:51:36,316 --> 00:51:38,413
and today's identification...

669
00:51:40,039 --> 00:51:41,883
Forget it.

670
00:51:41,883 --> 00:51:44,429
Can you please...

671
00:51:44,429 --> 00:51:46,520
just disappear?

672
00:51:46,520 --> 00:51:50,445
I'm begging you.
Don't make things worse and just go.

673
00:51:50,445 --> 00:51:54,197
Lee Hyuk isn't someone you can take on.

674
00:51:54,197 --> 00:51:58,596
So you never planned to investigate
Lee Hyuk at all, did you?

675
00:52:00,634 --> 00:52:03,818
How long have you been his lapdog?

676
00:52:04,708 --> 00:52:06,404
What?

677
00:52:06,404 --> 00:52:08,580
Lapdog?

678
00:52:08,580 --> 00:52:10,128
Say that again.

679
00:52:10,128 --> 00:52:11,760
Say that again!

680
00:52:11,760 --> 00:52:13,418
Move out of the way.

681
00:52:14,122 --> 00:52:17,779
I have nothing more to say
to someone like you.

682
00:52:17,779 --> 00:52:20,310
I'll find help elsewhere.

683
00:52:21,716 --> 00:52:25,618
I told you not make things worse!

684
00:52:26,306 --> 00:52:27,336
I said, move!

685
00:52:27,336 --> 00:52:29,287
Why, you...

686
00:52:29,287 --> 00:52:30,779
What are you doing?

687
00:52:30,779 --> 00:52:32,632
I should have just...!

688
00:52:33,719 --> 00:52:35,460
Let go of me!

689
00:52:36,143 --> 00:52:38,038
You bastard!

690
00:52:40,712 --> 00:52:44,959
Come on, why did you have to do that?

691
00:52:57,514 --> 00:52:59,805
It's time for you to go.

692
00:53:07,087 --> 00:53:08,567
Hey.

693
00:53:08,567 --> 00:53:11,399
What's the matter?

694
00:53:11,399 --> 00:53:13,073
Huh?

695
00:53:13,823 --> 00:53:15,696
Kang!

696
00:53:25,201 --> 00:53:27,243
My Lord, your friends are in danger.

697
00:53:27,243 --> 00:53:30,340
The seven illegitimate sons you cherish!
They are in grave danger.

698
00:53:30,340 --> 00:53:32,622
My friends? In danger?

699
00:53:32,622 --> 00:53:34,457
It's my fault.

700
00:53:34,457 --> 00:53:37,420
I rejected his offer, and now my friends...

701
00:53:37,420 --> 00:53:41,731
I take it Gwansong was the one
who ordered my death.

702
00:53:44,872 --> 00:53:47,410
I will. Now, it's time to go.
