[The characters, organizations,
and events in this drama]

9
00:00:28,475 --> 00:00:30,132
[are purely fictional
and unrelated to historical facts]

10
00:00:30,132 --> 00:00:34,252
[Animals were filmed under expert supervision
in accordance with welfare guidelines]

11
00:00:54,859 --> 00:00:57,982
Hey, Mal Bok, come over here.

12
00:01:00,529 --> 00:01:03,010
What's he plotting this time?

13
00:01:03,010 --> 00:01:05,549
Has that nobleman

14
00:01:05,549 --> 00:01:08,020
ever seemed sane to you?

15
00:01:08,020 --> 00:01:12,365
It's strange how he's so close to lowborns.

16
00:01:12,365 --> 00:01:13,627
That's what I'm saying.

17
00:01:13,627 --> 00:01:17,682
Is he really a nobleman
from a prestigious family?

18
00:01:17,682 --> 00:01:22,842
But he acts no different from Mal Bok.

19
00:01:23,747 --> 00:01:25,506
Don't be so quick to judge.

20
00:01:25,506 --> 00:01:28,992
Believe it or not,
they say he was famous in Hanyang

21
00:01:28,992 --> 00:01:31,836
for being brilliant.

22
00:01:31,836 --> 00:01:35,434
You sure they didn't mean
brilliantly bizarre?

23
00:01:36,850 --> 00:01:38,650
Mom.

24
00:01:40,609 --> 00:01:43,292
Mom, I need to borrow this.

25
00:01:43,292 --> 00:01:44,565
What now?

26
00:01:44,565 --> 00:01:46,618
You little rascal,
why do you need my skirt?

27
00:01:46,618 --> 00:01:48,064
Hurry and bring it back.

28
00:01:48,064 --> 00:01:52,277
He said he'd turn your old skirt
into a new one!

29
00:02:01,103 --> 00:02:02,710
Now!

30
00:02:02,710 --> 00:02:05,327
The most important task remains.

31
00:02:05,327 --> 00:02:07,336
- Are you ready?
- Yes!

32
00:02:07,336 --> 00:02:09,136
Let's go!

33
00:02:09,854 --> 00:02:11,876
Come here.

34
00:02:11,876 --> 00:02:13,773
Come here.

35
00:02:13,773 --> 00:02:16,691
Come over here! Come here!

36
00:02:16,691 --> 00:02:19,491
My goodness! My goodness!

37
00:02:24,617 --> 00:02:26,573
Everyone, look!

38
00:02:27,775 --> 00:02:30,189
[Gyosan, Heo Gyun's alias]

39
00:02:30,189 --> 00:02:32,720
<i>Gyosan.</i>

40
00:02:32,720 --> 00:02:37,228
<i>That man is like a fleeting shadow.</i>

41
00:02:37,813 --> 00:02:40,556
His thoughts stray beyond reason

42
00:02:40,556 --> 00:02:43,746
and his actions follow no order.

43
00:02:43,746 --> 00:02:46,305
He's like a goblin.

44
00:02:46,305 --> 00:02:49,639
But is that not what makes him so charming?

45
00:02:49,639 --> 00:02:53,215
Being free-spirited and relentless, that is.

46
00:02:53,215 --> 00:02:56,654
This nation stands upon
a traditional order that must be upheld.

47
00:02:56,654 --> 00:03:00,631
Yet Gyosan sought to shake
that very order to its roots.

48
00:03:03,697 --> 00:03:05,860
Your Highness.

49
00:03:05,860 --> 00:03:07,832
To neglect a virtuous and talented man

50
00:03:07,832 --> 00:03:12,018
solely because of his illegitimate birth
is a great loss to the nation.

51
00:03:12,876 --> 00:03:15,373
The heavens do not favor noble birth
in bestowing talent.

52
00:03:15,373 --> 00:03:20,059
Yet in this land, only the legitimate sons
of noble families may attain office.

53
00:03:20,059 --> 00:03:23,459
Is it any wonder, then, that we are always
in need of capable men?

54
00:03:24,622 --> 00:03:30,626
I humbly ask that you extend your grace
to these gifted illegitimate sons

55
00:03:30,626 --> 00:03:34,045
so that their abilities may serve
the nation to the fullest.

56
00:03:39,150 --> 00:03:42,270
As expected, Mae Chang,
you are the finest artist in Joseon!

57
00:03:43,595 --> 00:03:47,017
Come now, let's have another drink.

58
00:03:55,026 --> 00:03:57,944
Ah, Gwansong!

59
00:03:59,092 --> 00:04:03,756
I have something to discuss Gyosan,
step outside with me for a moment.

60
00:04:03,756 --> 00:04:05,579
Please come inside.

61
00:04:05,579 --> 00:04:07,679
Why not join us in conversation
with my friends?

62
00:04:07,679 --> 00:04:10,572
I'm here to discuss national affairs.

63
00:04:11,355 --> 00:04:15,155
This is not a discussion to be had
with the likes of these illegitimate sons.

64
00:04:17,499 --> 00:04:21,659
That is too harsh a remark.

65
00:04:21,659 --> 00:04:25,538
Is this because of the petition
I submitted to His Highness today?

66
00:04:25,538 --> 00:04:30,433
Do not waste your time chasing
foolish dreams of ever holding office.

67
00:04:30,433 --> 00:04:32,893
The traditional order of this land

68
00:04:32,893 --> 00:04:35,756
will not be so easily undone.

69
00:04:35,756 --> 00:04:38,274
I see it differently.

70
00:04:39,466 --> 00:04:44,202
Should we not reform outdated traditions
as times change?

71
00:04:46,386 --> 00:04:48,487
Did you not see it yourself that day?

72
00:04:48,487 --> 00:04:52,387
The way Gyosan defied this nation's order?

73
00:04:53,065 --> 00:04:57,002
Yet you know as well as I do

74
00:04:57,002 --> 00:05:01,032
that he is too brilliant
to waste away in a place like this.

75
00:05:01,032 --> 00:05:03,993
I, too, value Gyosan's talent.

76
00:05:03,993 --> 00:05:08,581
That is why I sent him here.

77
00:05:11,386 --> 00:05:14,272
When this horse first came to me

78
00:05:14,272 --> 00:05:18,465
it was impossible for any man to tame him.

79
00:05:18,465 --> 00:05:24,089
He was no different from a wild horse,
but I made him obedient.

80
00:05:24,089 --> 00:05:28,231
How did you manage to tame him?

81
00:05:28,231 --> 00:05:30,667
I taught him a lesson.

82
00:05:30,667 --> 00:05:34,160
One does not recklessly defy the world

83
00:05:34,160 --> 00:05:37,036
without consequences.

84
00:05:58,443 --> 00:06:01,697
Gyosan is a wise man.

85
00:06:01,697 --> 00:06:05,321
By now, he must have understood.

86
00:06:05,321 --> 00:06:08,204
I'd like to believe so...

87
00:06:17,388 --> 00:06:19,195
Inspector General!

88
00:06:19,195 --> 00:06:23,793
To have you grace this humble
and distant place is an honor beyond words.

89
00:06:23,793 --> 00:06:28,585
We gathered renowned bondmaids to prepare
a banquet for you to unwind...

90
00:06:33,628 --> 00:06:37,667
I didn't realize you had company.

91
00:06:37,667 --> 00:06:41,594
I shall make arrangements
so that the two of you may rest in private.

92
00:06:41,594 --> 00:06:43,396
That won't be necessary.

93
00:06:43,396 --> 00:06:45,196
More importantly…

94
00:06:46,147 --> 00:06:50,339
There's something I wish to see at once.

95
00:06:57,398 --> 00:07:00,861
If you sell these,
you'll have enough to afford a new skirt.

96
00:07:00,861 --> 00:07:04,728
Oh my, you caught this many
in such a short time?

97
00:07:04,728 --> 00:07:07,058
There's more.

98
00:07:14,830 --> 00:07:17,739
Share them with the villagers
so everyone can enjoy.

99
00:07:17,739 --> 00:07:20,379
A nice, hot fish soup
would be refreshing and delicious.

100
00:07:20,379 --> 00:07:22,409
What are you talking about?

101
00:07:22,409 --> 00:07:24,075
We should grill them!

102
00:07:24,075 --> 00:07:26,007
They're fresh!

103
00:07:26,007 --> 00:07:27,807
Wait!

104
00:07:29,442 --> 00:07:32,617
I know a recipe from my younger days.

105
00:07:34,912 --> 00:07:37,912
So delicious, you wouldn't notice
if the person next to you dropped dead!

106
00:07:40,877 --> 00:07:44,908
<i>First, scale the crucian carp,
remove the bones and entrails</i>

107
00:07:44,908 --> 00:07:47,381
<i>and soak it in saltwater</i>

108
00:07:48,981 --> 00:07:51,848
<i>Soak dried radish greens in water,
chop them finely</i>

109
00:07:51,848 --> 00:07:56,129
<i>and season with soy sauce,
ginger, and sesame oil</i>

110
00:07:56,129 --> 00:07:58,449
<i>before stuffing them inside the fish</i>

111
00:08:00,665 --> 00:08:02,719
<i>Then, blend old pumpkin into a puree
and pour it over the fish</i>

112
00:08:02,719 --> 00:08:06,719
<i>The salty greens and the pumpkin's natural
sweetness create the perfect harmony</i>

113
00:08:07,924 --> 00:08:10,250
<i>Finally, steam it over boiling water</i>

114
00:08:10,250 --> 00:08:13,771
Goodness, this is unbelievably delicious!

115
00:08:13,771 --> 00:08:17,447
I've never tasted anything like this before.

116
00:08:17,447 --> 00:08:22,224
Amazing, amazing! Is this really
the same crucian carp I know?

117
00:08:22,224 --> 00:08:28,977
The sweet pumpkin melts in your mouth.

118
00:08:30,733 --> 00:08:35,283
According to the memory
of this Transcendent Genius

119
00:08:35,283 --> 00:08:37,845
topping the fish with egg and beef garnish

120
00:08:37,845 --> 00:08:41,188
would make the flavors even richer.

121
00:08:41,188 --> 00:08:44,452
But those are hard to find here...

122
00:08:44,452 --> 00:08:47,350
This should be delicious enough, so enjoy!

123
00:09:05,152 --> 00:09:07,893
I have heard he shares a deep connection
with Your Excellency.

124
00:09:07,893 --> 00:09:12,666
I have ensured there will be
no discomfort in his stay.

125
00:09:17,164 --> 00:09:22,128
Are you confessing that you have been
conspiring with an exiled criminal?

126
00:09:22,128 --> 00:09:24,633
That's not what I meant.

127
00:09:24,633 --> 00:09:27,007
Or...

128
00:09:27,007 --> 00:09:31,766
Are you admitting your own incompetence
that you have failed to control a criminal?

129
00:09:31,766 --> 00:09:34,631
Your Excellency,
I have committed an unforgivable mistake.

130
00:09:34,631 --> 00:09:37,254
It was my poor judgment…

131
00:09:41,673 --> 00:09:43,763
Enjoy the food, everyone.

132
00:09:47,173 --> 00:09:49,407
It'd be nice if we could all eat together

133
00:09:49,407 --> 00:09:52,703
but since you always keep to yourselves,
I brought some over.

134
00:09:52,703 --> 00:09:55,763
It tastes quite decent,
so go ahead and try it.

135
00:09:56,349 --> 00:10:01,321
Look at you, pitying others
when you can't even see your own fate.

136
00:10:01,321 --> 00:10:04,779
I'm just sharing good food.

137
00:10:04,779 --> 00:10:07,115
Why go for the sore spot?

138
00:10:09,453 --> 00:10:11,480
But you're right.

139
00:10:11,480 --> 00:10:14,908
Given my situation,
who am I to pity anyone?

140
00:10:16,028 --> 00:10:19,936
So this isn't pity. It's just a small treat.

141
00:10:19,936 --> 00:10:21,736
Satisfied?

142
00:10:26,572 --> 00:10:30,859
You don't even realize
your own life is hanging by a thread.

143
00:10:38,722 --> 00:10:40,887
What do you mean?

144
00:10:40,887 --> 00:10:44,937
What did you just say about my life?

145
00:10:44,937 --> 00:10:47,119
Sir!

146
00:10:47,119 --> 00:10:50,021
Don't waste your time
talking to that madman!

147
00:10:50,021 --> 00:10:52,033
He's a terrible old man.

148
00:10:52,033 --> 00:10:56,627
That's right! Stay near him too long,
and misfortune is bound to follow.

149
00:10:56,627 --> 00:10:58,787
Don't mind him and join us instead.

150
00:11:08,408 --> 00:11:10,699
I'll admit it's not bad.

151
00:11:11,502 --> 00:11:16,976
Consider yourself lucky
This mere treat just saved your life.

152
00:11:28,351 --> 00:11:29,801
Oh! Magistrate!

153
00:11:29,801 --> 00:11:31,901
What brings you here?

154
00:11:35,394 --> 00:11:39,226
Arrest the criminal, Heo Gyun!

155
00:11:43,729 --> 00:11:47,803
Whoa, Magistrate, what's all this about?

156
00:11:47,803 --> 00:11:50,461
Are you upset because we didn't share
the good food with you?

157
00:11:50,461 --> 00:11:53,218
I'll catch more and cook for you, so…

158
00:11:53,218 --> 00:11:55,356
From this moment forward!

159
00:11:55,356 --> 00:11:59,003
Sinner Heo Gyun will be enclosed
in a thorn hedge.

160
00:11:59,003 --> 00:12:03,139
[A Joseon-era punishment where exiled criminals
were confined within a thorn hedge to prevent escape]

161
00:12:07,869 --> 00:12:13,404
Bear in mind! Heo Gyun is forbidden from
stepping even a foot outside his dwelling!

162
00:12:32,292 --> 00:12:34,155
Whoa there!

163
00:12:34,155 --> 00:12:36,635
My foot hasn't even touched the ground yet.

164
00:12:43,963 --> 00:12:45,946
You almost stabbed me!

165
00:12:46,723 --> 00:12:49,807
You're surprisingly quick.

166
00:12:59,121 --> 00:13:01,594
I already feel suffocated.

167
00:13:02,387 --> 00:13:05,829
How much longer must I stay trapped in here?

168
00:13:09,130 --> 00:13:13,267
With your temperament,
I doubt you'll last even three days.

169
00:13:13,267 --> 00:13:16,133
Ah, Gwansong!

170
00:13:17,647 --> 00:13:21,198
Had I known you were coming,
I would've gone to greet you.

171
00:13:23,420 --> 00:13:25,128
Oh, wait.

172
00:13:25,128 --> 00:13:27,068
I can't go outside.

173
00:13:35,758 --> 00:13:39,051
You haven't changed
Still as lighthearted as ever

174
00:13:39,051 --> 00:13:42,579
I've missed you terribly.

175
00:13:44,091 --> 00:13:47,571
You look even more dashing
than when I last saw you.

176
00:13:47,571 --> 00:13:50,414
Oh, how dazzling! My eyes, my eyes!

177
00:13:51,735 --> 00:13:53,774
Oh, come on now…

178
00:13:56,282 --> 00:13:58,582
Just look at yourself.

179
00:13:58,582 --> 00:14:03,388
A man as full of life as you,
wasting away for the rest of his days

180
00:14:03,388 --> 00:14:06,579
locked in a house
without even a single window?

181
00:14:07,854 --> 00:14:10,437
But what choice do I have?

182
00:14:10,437 --> 00:14:13,278
Until His Highness calls for me...

183
00:14:13,278 --> 00:14:15,192
In other words

184
00:14:15,192 --> 00:14:20,135
it'll be resolved if His Highness summons you.

185
00:14:20,135 --> 00:14:23,949
Did His Highness ask for me?

186
00:14:25,209 --> 00:14:27,351
Not yet.

187
00:14:30,028 --> 00:14:34,546
But you can make him.

188
00:14:34,546 --> 00:14:40,240
Gyosan, if you become someone
His Highness cannot do without.

189
00:14:40,240 --> 00:14:44,396
Then, His Highness will call for me.

190
00:14:46,136 --> 00:14:49,259
Tell me, what does His Highness need?

191
00:14:49,259 --> 00:14:51,499
I'll do whatever it takes! Anything!

192
00:15:03,301 --> 00:15:05,402
You're not serious, are you?

193
00:15:06,331 --> 00:15:11,015
Have I ever been anything but serious?

194
00:15:12,192 --> 00:15:15,195
It's just… too absurd to believe.

195
00:15:15,195 --> 00:15:18,835
Did you think becoming someone
His Highness needs

196
00:15:18,835 --> 00:15:21,715
would be easy?

197
00:15:21,715 --> 00:15:25,200
It's not about whether
it's easy or difficult.

198
00:15:25,200 --> 00:15:30,375
I cannot bring myself to commit
an act that defies morality.

199
00:15:30,375 --> 00:15:32,557
Then.

200
00:15:32,557 --> 00:15:36,138
Are you content to live like this
for the rest of your days?

201
00:15:37,048 --> 00:15:40,787
Even if I were to leave this place
by such means

202
00:15:42,136 --> 00:15:44,899
would I truly be free?

203
00:15:52,330 --> 00:15:54,279
Who dares come here?

204
00:15:55,807 --> 00:15:58,124
Please, calm down.

205
00:15:58,124 --> 00:16:01,543
They're my friends
the ones have helped me through exile.

206
00:16:04,929 --> 00:16:07,258
You haven't changed one bit.

207
00:16:07,258 --> 00:16:10,738
In Hanyang, you wasted your time
with illegitimate sons, and now.

208
00:16:12,482 --> 00:16:15,208
You surround yourself with lowborns?

209
00:16:16,042 --> 00:16:19,353
Even in exile,
you refuse to come to your senses!

210
00:16:22,628 --> 00:16:25,692
Do you not know that loitering near

211
00:16:25,692 --> 00:16:28,932
the house enclosed in a thorn hedge
is punishable by flogging?

212
00:16:30,532 --> 00:16:34,060
Gwansong, they're just children.

213
00:16:34,724 --> 00:16:37,892
I will speak to them
and make sure they never return.

214
00:16:37,892 --> 00:16:41,029
Please, just this once.

215
00:16:43,330 --> 00:16:45,650
And yet you think you're in a position

216
00:16:46,349 --> 00:16:50,063
to worry about those lowborns?

217
00:16:56,943 --> 00:16:59,702
You'll regret

218
00:17:01,184 --> 00:17:03,913
turning down my offer
for the rest of your life.

219
00:17:17,844 --> 00:17:19,809
You little rascals!

220
00:17:19,809 --> 00:17:22,040
Did you miss me that much?

221
00:17:24,947 --> 00:17:27,168
Ah, the price of fame…

222
00:17:28,421 --> 00:17:31,054
But still, you mustn't come here anymore.

223
00:17:31,054 --> 00:17:34,253
But you promised you'd tell us

224
00:17:34,253 --> 00:17:36,077
a fun story at dusk!

225
00:17:36,077 --> 00:17:39,284
Ah, that's right!

226
00:17:41,857 --> 00:17:45,756
Well then, I should finish the story today.

227
00:17:45,756 --> 00:17:47,277
Now, where did I leave off?

228
00:17:47,277 --> 00:17:50,231
Right when Hong Gil Dong
made a scarecrow out of straw

229
00:17:50,231 --> 00:17:52,766
and tricked the Commissioner General!

230
00:18:01,023 --> 00:18:05,271
Ah, yes! And so, Gil Dong
rebuked the General, saying.

231
00:18:05,271 --> 00:18:07,085
"You insolent wretch!"

232
00:18:07,085 --> 00:18:09,677
"You know full well what you've done!"

233
00:18:09,677 --> 00:18:11,222
Not you...

234
00:18:11,222 --> 00:18:13,412
Gil Dong said that, not me.

235
00:18:16,493 --> 00:18:19,967
"You brute! Being big doesn't mean
you can do whatever you want!"

236
00:18:20,622 --> 00:18:22,167
No, no!

237
00:18:22,167 --> 00:18:24,799
To the Commissioner General, not you.

238
00:18:35,101 --> 00:18:36,942
You've returned.

239
00:18:36,942 --> 00:18:38,927
How did it go?

240
00:18:38,927 --> 00:18:41,685
Is Gyosan safe and sound?

241
00:18:42,491 --> 00:18:47,720
He's coming back to Hanyang
with us now, isn't he?

242
00:18:47,720 --> 00:18:49,653
It was a waste of time

243
00:18:49,653 --> 00:18:52,145
I entertained a foolish hope.

244
00:18:53,128 --> 00:18:56,406
We leave at first light
Prepare yourself.

245
00:18:56,406 --> 00:18:58,503
Please.

246
00:18:58,503 --> 00:19:01,668
Let me speak with him, Your Excellency.

247
00:19:03,218 --> 00:19:06,600
Gyosan is a man who easily loses all reason
when it comes to women

248
00:19:06,600 --> 00:19:08,583
but this isn't something

249
00:19:08,583 --> 00:19:10,901
for you to meddle in, Mae Chang.

250
00:19:10,901 --> 00:19:13,418
Please, just give me a chance.

251
00:19:13,418 --> 00:19:18,580
Gyosan and I have been
close friends for years.

252
00:19:18,580 --> 00:19:21,298
If anyone can persuade him, it's me.

253
00:19:21,298 --> 00:19:23,098
Friends?

254
00:19:24,497 --> 00:19:28,352
Why is it that everyone Gyosan
surrounds himself with is so...

255
00:19:30,730 --> 00:19:33,014
Completely useless.

256
00:19:33,014 --> 00:19:35,821
The fool doesn't even realize what he has.

257
00:19:37,094 --> 00:19:39,119
He always said.

258
00:19:39,119 --> 00:19:44,425
Every person holds value,
a gift bestowed upon them by the heavens.

259
00:19:51,383 --> 00:19:55,486
And that is precisely the kind
of reckless thinking that led him here.

260
00:19:56,792 --> 00:20:00,670
If exile has not taught him his lesson.

261
00:20:05,271 --> 00:20:08,471
Then I have no choice but to prescribe
something far stronger.

262
00:20:15,049 --> 00:20:17,371
When Gil Dong used his shapeshifting skills
to turn into a tree

263
00:20:17,371 --> 00:20:21,352
he stood right before his pursuers,
yet no one could find him.

264
00:20:23,220 --> 00:20:25,087
Whoosh!

265
00:20:25,087 --> 00:20:28,487
And when he fled, he covered vast distances
in the blink of an eye.

266
00:20:29,337 --> 00:20:30,558
How's that?

267
00:20:30,558 --> 00:20:32,518
You can't see my feet, right?

268
00:20:39,030 --> 00:20:41,306
Then, one fateful night.

269
00:20:41,306 --> 00:20:45,571
As Hong Gil Dong gazed at the night sky

270
00:20:45,571 --> 00:20:50,390
a shooting star streaked across!

271
00:20:53,040 --> 00:20:55,744
The moment he saw it, he knew

272
00:20:57,357 --> 00:21:01,060
his father had passed away.

273
00:21:02,496 --> 00:21:06,442
Though he was never allowed
to call him "Father"

274
00:21:06,442 --> 00:21:10,993
he swore, through tears,
to fulfill his final duty as a son.

275
00:21:23,476 --> 00:21:26,097
After mourning for three years,
Hong Gil Dong led his men

276
00:21:26,097 --> 00:21:30,739
to a land called Yuldoguk,
where they would make a new home.

277
00:21:30,739 --> 00:21:32,147
Why?

278
00:21:32,147 --> 00:21:33,551
Why, you ask?

279
00:21:33,551 --> 00:21:35,484
Because...

280
00:21:35,484 --> 00:21:37,806
Yuldoguk was a land like no other.

281
00:21:37,806 --> 00:21:40,771
What makes it so special?

282
00:21:40,771 --> 00:21:43,808
Well… it was like paradise itself.

283
00:21:43,808 --> 00:21:46,293
What's paradise?

284
00:21:46,293 --> 00:21:48,405
How should I put it…

285
00:21:50,463 --> 00:21:54,136
A place where there's no difference
between high and lowborns

286
00:21:56,112 --> 00:22:00,591
where food is abundant,
so no one goes hungry

287
00:22:02,760 --> 00:22:07,524
where the landscapes are
as breathtaking as a painted folding screen.

288
00:22:09,409 --> 00:22:12,403
So, Yuldoguk is a place that...

289
00:22:14,017 --> 00:22:16,340
That is...

290
00:22:17,782 --> 00:22:19,773
Never mind!

291
00:22:19,773 --> 00:22:21,603
I'll write the rest down for you!

292
00:22:21,603 --> 00:22:25,022
But we don't know how to read.

293
00:22:31,560 --> 00:22:33,854
You know how to read, right?

294
00:22:37,155 --> 00:22:39,068
Ask that man to read it for you.

295
00:22:39,068 --> 00:22:42,700
Can't you just keep telling the story?

296
00:22:43,573 --> 00:22:45,734
I can't.

297
00:22:47,360 --> 00:22:51,020
If you keep coming here,
you might end up getting flogged.

298
00:22:55,444 --> 00:22:59,004
But if you really, really insist...

299
00:23:07,030 --> 00:23:11,796
Guess they're more afraid of flogging.

300
00:23:14,656 --> 00:23:16,984
Yuldoguk...

301
00:23:16,984 --> 00:23:19,365
Yuldoguk...

302
00:23:21,382 --> 00:23:25,064
How could the imagination
of this Transcendent Genius hit a wall?

303
00:23:27,325 --> 00:23:30,618
This is all because my stomach is empty.

304
00:23:35,658 --> 00:23:39,956
<i>In Yuldoguk, vast fertile fields
stretch beyond the horizon…</i>

305
00:23:39,956 --> 00:23:43,779
<i>From their rich soil,
the finest white rice is harvested</i>

306
00:23:43,779 --> 00:23:47,419
<i>Steamed to perfection and served with
a tender skewer of grilled meat…</i>

307
00:23:51,648 --> 00:23:53,804
Wait, what am I even writing?

308
00:23:53,804 --> 00:23:55,616
Again!

309
00:23:57,357 --> 00:24:02,071
<i>In the lands of Yuldoguk, conquered
by Hong Gil Dong, vibrant flowers bloom</i>

310
00:24:02,071 --> 00:24:05,596
<i>and sweet birds sing in the mountains…</i>

311
00:24:05,596 --> 00:24:08,716
<i>Pluck that bird's neck, skewer it</i>

312
00:24:08,716 --> 00:24:11,072
<i>season it with salt,
and roast it over glowing charcoal…</i>

313
00:24:11,072 --> 00:24:14,312
<i>So delicious, you'd scorch your mouth
and still keep eating!</i>

314
00:24:33,084 --> 00:24:37,262
I should've kept that braised fish for myself
instead of giving it away!

315
00:24:39,323 --> 00:24:43,546
Look at you, pitying others
when you can't even see your own fate.

316
00:24:51,183 --> 00:24:55,514
If I can't stop thinking about food, I might
as well write down every dish I crave!

317
00:25:10,338 --> 00:25:12,319
Deliver this letter.

318
00:25:12,319 --> 00:25:14,119
Yes, My Lord.

319
00:25:24,382 --> 00:25:26,088
What?!

320
00:25:26,088 --> 00:25:28,635
I'd like to take a look at that letter.

321
00:25:28,635 --> 00:25:29,927
You can't.

322
00:25:29,927 --> 00:25:32,932
If he finds out,
I'll be severely punished.

323
00:25:34,385 --> 00:25:39,170
But wouldn't the punishment be even worse
if he knew you've been using his name

324
00:25:39,170 --> 00:25:42,407
to slip in and out of courtesan houses?

325
00:25:44,416 --> 00:25:46,632
Show me.

326
00:25:46,632 --> 00:25:49,885
It'll be fine as long as
we keep this between us.

327
00:25:55,379 --> 00:25:57,273
Shh.

328
00:26:01,167 --> 00:26:04,531
[The faction of reckless illegitimate sons
is causing unrest in the nation.]

329
00:26:04,531 --> 00:26:08,805
[Find any excuse necessary to have
all seven of them arrested.]

330
00:26:13,961 --> 00:26:15,761
Unbelievable.

331
00:26:19,420 --> 00:26:22,525
I never realized there were
so many things I wanted to eat.

332
00:26:26,335 --> 00:26:31,398
Well, given all the meals I've missed
during exile, it's no surprise.

333
00:26:35,867 --> 00:26:40,189
I shall capture how people gnaw on nothing
but air while staring at a butcher's gate

334
00:26:40,189 --> 00:26:43,629
to suppress their craving for meat

335
00:26:43,629 --> 00:26:47,241
and name this book "Domundaejak".

336
00:27:32,141 --> 00:27:33,993
Is someone there?

337
00:28:14,952 --> 00:28:16,393
A ghost!?

338
00:28:16,393 --> 00:28:19,188
It's Mae Chang, My Lord.

339
00:28:21,161 --> 00:28:22,755
Mae Chang?

340
00:28:22,755 --> 00:28:25,084
Is it truly you, Mae Chang?

341
00:28:29,136 --> 00:28:32,890
Yes, it's me.

342
00:28:40,427 --> 00:28:42,514
What dream did I have last night

343
00:28:42,514 --> 00:28:46,065
to be blessed with
so many familiar faces today?

344
00:28:49,187 --> 00:28:51,016
But the guards must have been watching

345
00:28:51,016 --> 00:28:55,115
I found a way to distract them for a moment.

346
00:28:57,076 --> 00:28:58,598
Then come inside.

347
00:28:58,598 --> 00:29:01,774
We shall speak of all that has passed.

348
00:29:01,774 --> 00:29:06,307
I wish we could, but now is not the time.

349
00:29:08,788 --> 00:29:11,740
The Inspector General was here, was he not?

350
00:29:11,740 --> 00:29:13,708
And how would you know that?

351
00:29:13,708 --> 00:29:16,556
You must listen to his request, My Lord.

352
00:29:17,880 --> 00:29:20,431
Did Gwansong send you?

353
00:29:20,431 --> 00:29:22,118
To persuade me?

354
00:29:22,118 --> 00:29:26,868
No, I slipped away unnoticed.

355
00:29:26,868 --> 00:29:31,150
Do not press me for answers
Just heed my words.

356
00:29:31,150 --> 00:29:33,741
I cannot.

357
00:29:33,741 --> 00:29:36,593
I refuse to even consider it

358
00:29:36,593 --> 00:29:38,451
so do not speak of it again.

359
00:29:38,451 --> 00:29:40,610
But if you refuse now...

360
00:29:40,610 --> 00:29:42,446
I know.

361
00:29:43,388 --> 00:29:47,652
I will live out my days
trapped within these walls.

362
00:29:48,998 --> 00:29:51,976
I have accepted my fate
Now leave.

363
00:29:51,976 --> 00:29:55,939
And if that's all you have to say,
do not return.

364
00:29:57,106 --> 00:29:59,858
My Lord, your friends are in danger.

365
00:30:01,140 --> 00:30:05,485
The seven illegitimate sons you cherish!
They are in grave danger.

366
00:30:05,485 --> 00:30:07,934
What did you say?

367
00:30:07,934 --> 00:30:10,494
My friends? In danger?

368
00:30:10,494 --> 00:30:14,577
You know better than anyone
that once the Inspector General sets

369
00:30:14,577 --> 00:30:18,791
his mind on something, he does not relent.

370
00:30:18,791 --> 00:30:23,149
If you refuse, he will not waver.

371
00:30:23,149 --> 00:30:25,582
He will simply use your friends instead.

372
00:30:25,582 --> 00:30:28,930
That isn't something my friends can do.

373
00:30:28,930 --> 00:30:30,565
Are you saying

374
00:30:30,565 --> 00:30:34,881
he is plotting something against them?

375
00:30:35,982 --> 00:30:38,785
No, he would never.

376
00:30:38,785 --> 00:30:43,393
But I saw it with my own eye.

377
00:30:43,393 --> 00:30:46,225
The letter written in his own hand.

378
00:30:54,647 --> 00:30:56,533
My Lord!

379
00:31:01,784 --> 00:31:04,065
My Lord!

380
00:31:04,065 --> 00:31:05,983
My Lord!

381
00:31:06,730 --> 00:31:09,713
<i>Does he mean to achieve his will</i>

382
00:31:09,713 --> 00:31:12,711
<i>by sacrificing my friends instead?</i>

383
00:31:12,711 --> 00:31:14,488
<i>It's my fault</i>

384
00:31:14,488 --> 00:31:18,008
<i>I rejected his offer, and now my friends…</i>

385
00:31:23,352 --> 00:31:25,120
Your Excellency!

386
00:31:25,120 --> 00:31:28,127
Heo Gyun escaped his dwelling.

387
00:31:28,127 --> 00:31:30,056
What nonsense is this?

388
00:31:30,664 --> 00:31:33,373
How could you have let this happen?

389
00:31:34,663 --> 00:31:36,549
Bring her!

390
00:31:48,780 --> 00:31:52,558
I only did as you wished

391
00:31:52,558 --> 00:31:56,141
I tried to change Gyosan's mind.

392
00:31:56,141 --> 00:32:00,317
And so, I told him about the letter.

393
00:32:01,275 --> 00:32:03,698
You fool...

394
00:32:03,698 --> 00:32:07,031
Do you realize what you've done?

395
00:32:07,619 --> 00:32:10,918
You have killed Gyosan.

396
00:32:10,918 --> 00:32:13,259
I beg your pardon.

397
00:32:13,259 --> 00:32:15,545
Killed him?

398
00:32:15,545 --> 00:32:18,522
Now that Gyosan knows my plans

399
00:32:18,522 --> 00:32:19,972
he cannot be allowed to live.

400
00:32:19,972 --> 00:32:21,829
So tell me

401
00:32:22,646 --> 00:32:25,524
did you not kill him yourself?

402
00:32:26,159 --> 00:32:28,593
I was blind to the consequences.

403
00:32:28,593 --> 00:32:31,393
Please, I beg you, abandon this course.

404
00:32:35,325 --> 00:32:38,552
You should worry about your own life.

405
00:32:42,630 --> 00:32:44,430
Your Excellency.

406
00:32:46,533 --> 00:32:52,041
We searched the entire village,
but he is already gone.

407
00:32:52,041 --> 00:32:55,718
Shall I request cooperation
from the neighboring villages?

408
00:32:55,718 --> 00:32:57,142
No need.

409
00:32:57,142 --> 00:33:00,185
He is heading for Hanyang.

410
00:33:00,185 --> 00:33:03,401
All we need to do is block his path.

411
00:33:03,401 --> 00:33:06,463
I have a trusted swordsman waiting ahead.

412
00:33:07,110 --> 00:33:09,822
Words reach me soon enough.

413
00:34:34,746 --> 00:34:39,172
Had I not been starving,
I'd have crossed this hill in half an hour.

414
00:34:39,782 --> 00:34:42,828
You wouldn't happen to have
a rice ball, would you?

415
00:34:42,828 --> 00:34:46,308
They say even ghosts look better
when they've died on a full stomach.

416
00:34:47,048 --> 00:34:49,743
Have a little mercy on a dying man.

417
00:34:55,570 --> 00:34:59,401
Don't underestimate me
I once practiced the sword myself!

418
00:34:59,401 --> 00:35:01,458
Let's see what you've got!

419
00:35:10,709 --> 00:35:12,509
Check him.

420
00:35:21,949 --> 00:35:23,749
Oh?

421
00:35:29,857 --> 00:35:32,354
So books really are mightier than swords!

422
00:35:39,734 --> 00:35:44,207
I take it Gwansong was the one
who ordered my death.

423
00:35:45,148 --> 00:35:47,021
Tell him

424
00:35:47,871 --> 00:35:50,775
that I accept my fate without resentment.

425
00:35:50,775 --> 00:35:54,736
But in return, I ask that
my innocent friends be spared.

426
00:35:55,988 --> 00:35:57,988
Will you deliver that message?

427
00:36:03,108 --> 00:36:05,782
I will. Now, it's time to go.

428
00:36:21,850 --> 00:36:24,173
Go and stop him!

429
00:36:24,173 --> 00:36:27,144
You don't need to kill him!

430
00:36:27,144 --> 00:36:28,944
Run now!

431
00:36:33,891 --> 00:36:36,118
It's time for you to go.

432
00:37:02,476 --> 00:37:04,698
<i>I want to disappear.</i>

433
00:37:04,698 --> 00:37:06,999
<i>I want to vanish.</i>

434
00:37:07,750 --> 00:37:12,381
<i>Sink right into the ground and be gone.</i>

435
00:37:15,620 --> 00:37:18,070
If things ever get tough,
you can always talk to me.

436
00:37:18,070 --> 00:37:20,536
You know where my office is, right?

437
00:37:20,536 --> 00:37:23,116
Or what are you up to this weekend?

438
00:37:23,116 --> 00:37:26,432
Where did you say you live?

439
00:37:26,432 --> 00:37:29,832
Not too far from work, I hope?

440
00:37:29,832 --> 00:37:33,220
<i>Don't do it, Eun Sil.</i>

441
00:37:33,220 --> 00:37:35,429
<i>You already know how this ends.</i>

442
00:37:35,429 --> 00:37:37,986
<i>Standing up to power, exposing corruption.</i>

443
00:37:37,986 --> 00:37:41,162
<i>will only get you fired, not those bastards.</i>

444
00:37:42,609 --> 00:37:44,198
Drink up, up, up!

445
00:37:44,198 --> 00:37:46,445
<i>Hold it in.</i>

446
00:37:46,445 --> 00:37:48,900
<i>You have to...</i>

447
00:37:48,900 --> 00:37:51,218
<i>Hold yourself back.</i>

448
00:37:51,218 --> 00:37:53,592
<i>Stay quiet, Bong Eun Sil.</i>

449
00:38:00,416 --> 00:38:01,976
What the?

450
00:38:01,976 --> 00:38:03,635
This is too good to keep to myself

451
00:38:03,635 --> 00:38:07,096
so I figured I'd capture the moment
to remember the company dinner.

452
00:38:07,096 --> 00:38:09,780
Sir, you look terrible right now.

453
00:38:09,780 --> 00:38:11,580
Smile.

454
00:38:12,522 --> 00:38:14,060
Have you lost your mind?

455
00:38:14,060 --> 00:38:17,212
- Hey, turn the music off.
- Hey!

456
00:38:17,212 --> 00:38:19,563
Turn off that music.

457
00:38:19,563 --> 00:38:22,221
- Give me that!
- Sorry, no can do!

458
00:38:22,221 --> 00:38:25,821
Still got 20 months left on the payments,
so it's practically brand new.

459
00:38:27,229 --> 00:38:29,951
Don't you know who I am?

460
00:38:30,813 --> 00:38:32,562
Of course I know who you are.

461
00:38:32,562 --> 00:38:35,011
You're the CEO's one-and-only brother.

462
00:38:35,011 --> 00:38:37,101
The almighty No.2 of our company.

463
00:38:37,101 --> 00:38:39,374
Director Ko.

464
00:38:39,374 --> 00:38:43,228
That's why, even now, you still get away
with harassing female employees.

465
00:38:43,228 --> 00:38:46,454
Do you have a death wish or something?

466
00:38:46,454 --> 00:38:49,768
I very much want to live.

467
00:38:49,768 --> 00:38:51,828
But if I have to go down…

468
00:38:51,828 --> 00:38:54,679
I'm not going alone.

469
00:38:54,679 --> 00:38:57,053
You're coming with me, Director.

470
00:39:13,254 --> 00:39:15,348
Darn it.

471
00:39:17,719 --> 00:39:20,093
<i>I'm doomed.</i>

472
00:39:37,891 --> 00:39:40,873
Thanks to you, My Lord.
We're eating well today.

473
00:39:40,873 --> 00:39:43,056
Gwansong!

474
00:39:43,056 --> 00:39:44,856
How's that?

475
00:39:53,476 --> 00:39:56,753
<i>I remember falling asleep while writing...</i>

476
00:39:57,845 --> 00:40:00,214
<i>But where am I?</i>

477
00:40:07,832 --> 00:40:10,930
No... My topknot!

478
00:40:10,930 --> 00:40:13,099
Where did my topknot go?

479
00:40:13,099 --> 00:40:15,278
What misfortune is this?

480
00:40:17,641 --> 00:40:22,490
What on earth happened while I was asleep?

481
00:40:27,937 --> 00:40:30,353
<i>A wretched world.</i>

482
00:40:37,748 --> 00:40:39,852
<i>What the?</i>

483
00:40:42,559 --> 00:40:47,071
Mister, you can't just sleep here like this.

484
00:40:49,002 --> 00:40:51,111
Bong Eun Sil, mind your business!

485
00:40:51,111 --> 00:40:53,901
Okay, stop being nosy!

486
00:40:53,901 --> 00:40:55,733
Excuse me, young lady!

487
00:40:57,008 --> 00:40:59,471
Where is this place?

488
00:40:59,471 --> 00:41:01,906
You want to know where we are?

489
00:41:03,923 --> 00:41:06,098
This is hell.

490
00:41:06,098 --> 00:41:08,091
A living hell.

491
00:41:08,091 --> 00:41:09,891
Hell?

492
00:41:10,735 --> 00:41:14,083
Then, am I dead?

493
00:41:16,682 --> 00:41:19,349
I got fired today, too.

494
00:41:20,236 --> 00:41:23,576
Were you burnt at the stake?

495
00:41:23,576 --> 00:41:25,623
But then, I...

496
00:41:25,623 --> 00:41:28,791
I have no idea why I've died.

497
00:41:31,110 --> 00:41:33,397
Did I starve to death?

498
00:41:34,614 --> 00:41:36,723
Mister.

499
00:41:37,545 --> 00:41:40,263
In our next life

500
00:41:40,263 --> 00:41:44,088
let's be reborn as a CEO's little brother.

501
00:41:44,088 --> 00:41:46,190
Promise.

502
00:41:46,986 --> 00:41:49,934
If you're drunk, just come home quietly
instead of making a fuss!

503
00:41:49,934 --> 00:41:51,081
Go inside!

504
00:41:51,081 --> 00:41:52,594
That was delicious.

505
00:41:52,594 --> 00:41:54,454
Thanks, take care.

506
00:41:54,454 --> 00:41:56,254
Excuse me!

507
00:41:57,221 --> 00:41:58,793
This is my first time in the afterlife

508
00:41:58,793 --> 00:42:02,202
so forgive my boldness.

509
00:42:02,202 --> 00:42:04,481
Could you spare some food?

510
00:42:04,481 --> 00:42:08,038
We're closed for today,
come back in the morning.

511
00:42:08,038 --> 00:42:09,957
Madam, please!

512
00:42:25,770 --> 00:42:27,729
Take your time eating.

513
00:42:27,729 --> 00:42:30,480
I won't close up until you finish.

514
00:42:30,480 --> 00:42:32,401
Thank you.

515
00:42:36,500 --> 00:42:39,672
Your hair is in the way.

516
00:42:42,457 --> 00:42:45,178
Try tying it back with this.

517
00:43:02,655 --> 00:43:06,890
Hunger makes the best seasoning,
but this is beyond amazing!

518
00:43:06,890 --> 00:43:10,420
People might come to the afterlife
just to eat this!

519
00:43:10,420 --> 00:43:12,566
You are quite witty.

520
00:43:12,566 --> 00:43:14,128
Are you a comedian?

521
00:43:14,128 --> 00:43:16,247
You surely look like one.

522
00:43:16,875 --> 00:43:19,004
Gomedwian?

523
00:43:19,004 --> 00:43:21,216
Is there such a public post in Joseon?

524
00:43:21,216 --> 00:43:22,756
I've never heard of it.

525
00:43:22,756 --> 00:43:26,320
Mom, water.

526
00:43:26,320 --> 00:43:28,564
Get it yourself!

527
00:43:29,815 --> 00:43:32,344
Would you like some more kkakdugi?

528
00:43:32,344 --> 00:43:34,681
Ugh, my head…

529
00:43:52,781 --> 00:43:55,223
You're awake, my fellow afterlife traveler.

530
00:43:55,223 --> 00:43:57,226
What fellow traveler?

531
00:43:57,226 --> 00:43:59,507
Didn't you say it earlier?

532
00:44:00,657 --> 00:44:02,457
That you got fired.

533
00:44:03,382 --> 00:44:06,935
Keep it down!
Mom will kill me if she finds out.

534
00:44:08,023 --> 00:44:10,181
Aren't you already dead?

535
00:44:12,246 --> 00:44:15,442
Mister, do you even have money?

536
00:44:16,086 --> 00:44:18,781
For the meal, do you?

537
00:44:20,856 --> 00:44:23,857
I usually keep some coins right here…

538
00:44:30,438 --> 00:44:32,264
I knew it.

539
00:44:32,264 --> 00:44:35,447
You're obviously homeless.

540
00:44:38,989 --> 00:44:42,339
No kkakdugi for you!
Mom, this guy has no money.

541
00:44:42,339 --> 00:44:45,083
Just eat. Don't worry about the money.

542
00:44:46,145 --> 00:44:48,199
Are we running a charity here?

543
00:44:48,199 --> 00:44:50,437
This guy doesn't pay because he's broke.

544
00:44:50,437 --> 00:44:53,066
That guy eats for free because he's sick.

545
00:44:53,066 --> 00:44:57,208
And that's why, no matter how hard you work,
you never save a dime.

546
00:44:57,208 --> 00:44:59,979
You talk like you run the place

547
00:44:59,979 --> 00:45:03,176
but you don't lift a finger
so stay out of it.

548
00:45:03,176 --> 00:45:07,564
I'll run the restaurant,
you just focus on keeping your job.

549
00:45:10,138 --> 00:45:12,695
Don't mind her, just eat.

550
00:45:20,002 --> 00:45:23,665
Serving a warm meal to someone hungry

551
00:45:23,665 --> 00:45:25,351
is a good deed.

552
00:45:25,351 --> 00:45:27,931
Yeah, yeah, I've heard that one before.

553
00:45:27,931 --> 00:45:31,515
I'm going to run this place till I drop.

554
00:45:33,124 --> 00:45:34,192
Ugh, my head…

555
00:45:34,192 --> 00:45:37,228
If I may ask…

556
00:45:37,228 --> 00:45:40,967
Why do you two keep talking
about life and death?

557
00:45:40,967 --> 00:45:43,440
Can one even die twice?

558
00:45:48,140 --> 00:45:51,881
I haven't died before,
but I sure feel like I did.

559
00:45:51,881 --> 00:45:54,830
So this is what being alive feels like.

560
00:45:54,830 --> 00:45:57,347
I feel like I could do anything!

561
00:45:59,041 --> 00:46:01,652
Wow, he's completely lost it.

562
00:46:04,138 --> 00:46:06,584
I may have nothing right now

563
00:46:06,584 --> 00:46:09,295
but I'll return to repay
the cost of this meal.

564
00:46:09,295 --> 00:46:11,187
Until then...

565
00:46:14,175 --> 00:46:17,005
Keep this as collateral.

566
00:46:17,005 --> 00:46:20,136
I said you don't need to pay.

567
00:46:20,828 --> 00:46:22,628
Just take it.

568
00:46:24,922 --> 00:46:27,003
Do you have a place to stay?

569
00:46:28,037 --> 00:46:32,897
A man doesn't die
just because he sleeps under the stars.

570
00:46:33,959 --> 00:46:37,137
Many a time, I spent the night like that
on my way to the civil service exam.

571
00:46:37,137 --> 00:46:39,500
Civil service exams...

572
00:46:39,500 --> 00:46:41,300
Then...

573
00:46:45,385 --> 00:46:49,281
Wow, he's really deep in character.

574
00:46:52,404 --> 00:46:54,204
Go inside.

575
00:47:15,356 --> 00:47:16,750
<i>Incredible.</i>

576
00:47:16,750 --> 00:47:19,286
<i>Houses towering higher than mountains…</i>

577
00:47:24,190 --> 00:47:26,889
<i>Carriages swifter than horses…</i>

578
00:47:28,294 --> 00:47:30,162
This place...

579
00:47:31,124 --> 00:47:33,308
This is not Joseon!

580
00:47:37,492 --> 00:47:41,463
<i>They speak Joseon's tongue
yet wear foreign clothes.</i>

581
00:47:42,438 --> 00:47:46,266
<i>Men and women mingle freely,
without restraint.</i>

582
00:47:46,266 --> 00:47:50,292
<i>Food is plentiful, and no one starves.</i>

583
00:47:52,419 --> 00:47:54,240
This must be!

584
00:47:54,991 --> 00:47:58,586
The Yuldoguk I dreamed of!

585
00:47:59,238 --> 00:48:01,992
Yuldoguk is real!

586
00:48:03,768 --> 00:48:06,771
No, that can't be…!

587
00:48:06,771 --> 00:48:08,859
[Youngest Korean Cuisine
Master's Restaurant, Dorae]

588
00:48:08,859 --> 00:48:10,676
[Chef Lee Hyuk]

589
00:48:10,676 --> 00:48:12,987
Gwansong?

590
00:48:46,605 --> 00:48:48,789
I'm sorry, Ms. Bong.

591
00:48:48,789 --> 00:48:50,960
Because of me...

592
00:48:52,080 --> 00:48:54,298
You're severely mistaken.

593
00:48:54,298 --> 00:48:56,701
Do you think I did it for you?

594
00:48:56,701 --> 00:48:59,097
It was for my own peace of mind.

595
00:48:59,097 --> 00:49:01,151
But still...

596
00:49:03,145 --> 00:49:06,719
But you should express yourself firmly.

597
00:49:06,719 --> 00:49:11,468
Director Ko only preys on those
who won't push back.

598
00:49:12,433 --> 00:49:16,129
Ji Eun, about what I asked earlier.

599
00:49:16,129 --> 00:49:17,969
You should get going.

600
00:49:27,389 --> 00:49:30,697
Even while getting fired,
I still can't mind my own business.

601
00:49:46,220 --> 00:49:48,020
Hello.

602
00:49:49,565 --> 00:49:51,035
Chef Lee Hyuk?

603
00:49:51,035 --> 00:49:53,646
Hello.

604
00:49:53,646 --> 00:49:56,160
You look even better in person.

605
00:49:58,017 --> 00:50:00,180
I've seen you a lot on TV.

606
00:50:00,180 --> 00:50:01,906
Thank you.

607
00:50:01,906 --> 00:50:04,926
You must be the daughter
of the diner owner, right?

608
00:50:05,980 --> 00:50:07,700
Do you know me?

609
00:50:07,700 --> 00:50:11,555
Of course, we're neighbors.

610
00:50:12,520 --> 00:50:14,573
"We?"

611
00:50:14,573 --> 00:50:18,603
Oh, do you have some time to spare?

612
00:50:18,603 --> 00:50:20,600
Of course!

613
00:50:21,603 --> 00:50:23,403
Please come inside.

614
00:50:42,852 --> 00:50:45,348
Why is everything so expensive?

615
00:50:53,289 --> 00:50:56,893
It's an appetizer made
with truffles and sea bream.

616
00:50:56,893 --> 00:50:58,490
Do you eat raw fish?

617
00:50:58,490 --> 00:51:01,335
Only when I can get my hands on it.

618
00:51:03,102 --> 00:51:05,902
But why all this for me?

619
00:51:05,902 --> 00:51:10,819
I've always wanted to serve my food
to my neighbors at least once.

620
00:51:10,819 --> 00:51:14,077
Wow, how thoughtful of you.

621
00:51:24,051 --> 00:51:26,468
This is incredible.

622
00:51:26,468 --> 00:51:28,390
Does it suit your taste?

623
00:51:28,390 --> 00:51:30,438
It's so refined.

624
00:51:30,438 --> 00:51:32,948
A whole different level from diner food.

625
00:51:35,060 --> 00:51:37,183
Not that I should be saying this…

626
00:51:37,956 --> 00:51:41,726
Speaking of which...

627
00:51:41,726 --> 00:51:45,774
I actually have some questions
about your mother's place.

628
00:51:52,494 --> 00:51:55,785
- Excuse me, can I ask you something?
- Yes?

629
00:51:55,785 --> 00:51:59,294
Do you know what "Dorae" is?

630
00:51:59,294 --> 00:52:01,162
Over there.

631
00:52:09,963 --> 00:52:11,548
[Dorae]

632
00:52:11,548 --> 00:52:13,556
Gwansong!

633
00:52:13,556 --> 00:52:15,968
I came to the right place.

634
00:52:17,170 --> 00:52:20,834
I never thought
I'd find Gwansong in Yuldoguk.

635
00:52:20,834 --> 00:52:22,808
Oh, don't even get me started.

636
00:52:22,808 --> 00:52:26,073
Can you believe it's only 5,000 won
in this economy? Just 5,000 won!

637
00:52:26,073 --> 00:52:29,317
We barely make 500 won per serving

638
00:52:29,317 --> 00:52:33,935
and on top of that, my mom keeps finding
excuses to give meals away for free.

639
00:52:33,935 --> 00:52:36,707
The more we sell,
the deeper we sink into the red.

640
00:52:36,707 --> 00:52:42,036
Why does your mother insist on continuing
this profitless and tough business?

641
00:52:42,036 --> 00:52:44,120
I have no clue!

642
00:52:44,120 --> 00:52:47,781
I've been nagging her to close it down.

643
00:52:47,781 --> 00:52:52,573
But my mom said
she'll run the business till she drops.

644
00:52:52,573 --> 00:52:54,713
She's unstoppable.

645
00:52:54,713 --> 00:52:56,513
I see.

646
00:52:57,479 --> 00:53:00,328
Hello there.

647
00:53:04,087 --> 00:53:06,730
Hello there.

648
00:53:07,814 --> 00:53:10,139
Is anyone inside?

649
00:53:11,430 --> 00:53:14,039
Hello there!

650
00:53:17,854 --> 00:53:20,027
- Who...
- Gwansong!

651
00:53:21,984 --> 00:53:23,606
Why are you here again?

652
00:53:23,606 --> 00:53:26,453
Don't be rude to the chef!

653
00:53:26,453 --> 00:53:29,761
Are you okay?

654
00:53:30,774 --> 00:53:32,866
I'm okay.

655
00:53:34,572 --> 00:53:36,189
Do you know him?

656
00:53:36,189 --> 00:53:37,768
Know him?

657
00:53:37,768 --> 00:53:41,396
He ate at our place yesterday,

658
00:53:41,396 --> 00:53:43,436
but he seems mentally unwell...

659
00:53:44,142 --> 00:53:47,476
Wait, you're the lady from last night...

660
00:53:50,436 --> 00:53:54,480
Does this mean I've returned
to last night's tavern?

661
00:53:54,480 --> 00:53:56,601
What's he on about?
