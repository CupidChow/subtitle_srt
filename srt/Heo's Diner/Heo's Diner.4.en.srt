00:01:25,375 --> 00:01:26,707
Huh?

What exactly do you believe in?

30
00:01:31,549 --> 00:01:34,470
Well, that you're...

31
00:01:38,929 --> 00:01:42,178
From Joseon and destined to return there.

32
00:01:42,178 --> 00:01:44,265
You know me well.

33
00:01:44,265 --> 00:01:48,618
I must figure out why I came here
and how to return to Joseon.

34
00:01:48,618 --> 00:01:50,945
I have no time to be tied down elsewhere.

35
00:01:51,867 --> 00:01:53,467
Then...

36
00:01:55,242 --> 00:01:57,413
Do you have anywhere to go?

37
00:01:59,140 --> 00:02:00,969
It's freezing these days.

38
00:02:00,969 --> 00:02:04,805
Are you planning to search for
your reason and method out on the streets?

39
00:02:07,833 --> 00:02:11,727
If you work here, food and lodging
will be sorted out immediately.

40
00:02:13,209 --> 00:02:15,781
So, let's run this place...

41
00:02:15,781 --> 00:02:17,381
together.

42
00:02:18,594 --> 00:02:19,867
Whoa!

Leaving now would be impolite.

45
00:02:26,217 --> 00:02:28,600
I suppose I'll hear you out a bit more.

46
00:02:31,079 --> 00:02:33,424
Since you have much to do

47
00:02:33,424 --> 00:02:36,913
we'll only open for lunch,
and the rest is your free time.

48

That's all?

49
00:02:40,250 --> 00:02:43,065
I'll also give you vacation days
with mutual agreement.

And?

51
00:02:44,294 --> 00:02:45,894
And more?

53

So, what more?

54
00:02:54,882 --> 00:02:57,335
If that's what you're asking.

55
00:02:57,335 --> 00:02:59,209
Then, how about working together

56
00:02:59,209 --> 00:03:01,601
not just as boss and employee

57
00:03:01,601 --> 00:03:03,543
but like a family.

58
00:03:04,247 --> 00:03:06,514
"A family?"

59
00:03:09,065 --> 00:03:11,870
That just sounds like empty flattery.

60
00:03:11,870 --> 00:03:13,529
Not at all.

61
00:03:13,529 --> 00:03:14,930
Maybe not in Joseon

62
00:03:14,930 --> 00:03:17,776
but plenty of companies work this way here.

63
00:03:18,966 --> 00:03:21,317
Like so-called families.

64
00:03:24,096 --> 00:03:26,673
This is Yuldoguk, your paradise.

65
00:03:27,502 --> 00:03:29,889
So why not give it a shot?

66
00:03:36,987 --> 00:03:40,504
Can I think about it overnight?

67
00:03:40,504 --> 00:03:42,435
You need more time?

68
00:03:43,950 --> 00:03:45,386
Will that be a problem?

69
00:03:45,386 --> 00:03:46,971
Of course not.

70
00:03:46,971 --> 00:03:48,490
Think it over.

71
00:03:48,490 --> 00:03:51,090
I'm not the type to pressure people anyway.

72
00:03:52,735 --> 00:03:54,666
I see.

73
00:03:55,952 --> 00:03:59,216
Then go ahead and make the bed.

74
00:04:03,859 --> 00:04:07,553
I've had a long day, so I'm exhausted.

75
00:04:11,954 --> 00:04:15,454
Oh, and take care of this
while you're at it.

76
00:04:16,734 --> 00:04:19,132
What am I supposed to do with this?

77
00:04:19,132 --> 00:04:21,527
Are you asking me to wash it?

78
00:04:21,527 --> 00:04:23,212
Exactly.

79
00:04:24,481 --> 00:04:26,331
Like a family.

80
00:04:26,972 --> 00:04:29,968
Yes, like a family.

81
00:04:31,048 --> 00:04:35,377
Be gentle, like washing a baby.

82
00:04:35,999 --> 00:04:38,271
It's cotton from the Ming Dynasty.

83
00:04:38,271 --> 00:04:39,871
Got it.

84
00:04:47,880 --> 00:04:49,789
Cotton from the Ming Dynasty?

85
00:04:50,379 --> 00:04:53,401
I thought he was just a lunatic,
but he's sly like a fox.

86
00:04:53,401 --> 00:04:55,472
I better not let my guard down.

87
00:04:55,472 --> 00:04:57,453
I need to stay sharp.

88
00:05:14,527 --> 00:05:17,964
This is the place where I first arrived

89
00:05:17,964 --> 00:05:21,286
and for some reason, I keep returning to it.

90
00:05:27,067 --> 00:05:28,667
Madam!

91
00:05:30,698 --> 00:05:35,167
Is there something here that I must find?

92
00:05:36,848 --> 00:05:40,329
If so, staying here wouldn't be so bad.

93
00:05:41,553 --> 00:05:44,280
It's quite warm and comforting.

94
00:06:04,243 --> 00:06:05,896
Is anyone there?

95
00:06:18,808 --> 00:06:20,408
Mae Chang!

96
00:06:23,280 --> 00:06:27,572
Mae Chang, why do you look so sad?

97
00:06:29,761 --> 00:06:31,746
What?

98
00:06:31,746 --> 00:06:34,100
Speak a little louder.

99
00:06:34,692 --> 00:06:36,327
Mae Chang!

100
00:06:37,748 --> 00:06:39,657
Mister.

101
00:06:39,657 --> 00:06:41,268
Mister.

102
00:06:46,324 --> 00:06:47,952
Why are you here?

103
00:06:48,749 --> 00:06:50,445
What about Mae Chang?

104
00:06:50,445 --> 00:06:52,224
Where is Mae Chang...

105
00:06:53,540 --> 00:06:55,595
I was worried for nothing.

106
00:06:55,595 --> 00:06:58,567
You must've had a deep sleep, even dreaming.

107
00:07:00,141 --> 00:07:04,708
Now that it's morning, we should wrap up
our conversation from last night, right?

108
00:07:04,708 --> 00:07:06,693
What do you mean...

109
00:07:06,693 --> 00:07:09,065
I knew you'd play innocent.

110
00:07:09,065 --> 00:07:12,678
So, I stayed up all night drafting
an employment contract.

111
00:07:12,678 --> 00:07:16,028
Since you don't have a signature or a seal

112
00:07:17,740 --> 00:07:20,836
you can just press your thumbprint right here.

113
00:07:20,836 --> 00:07:23,687
Oh, a thumbprint.

114
00:07:23,687 --> 00:07:28,241
In Joseon, we didn't use fingerprints,
but rather drew the shape of the hand.

115
00:07:28,241 --> 00:07:30,073
It was called a hand seal.

116
00:07:30,073 --> 00:07:33,711
Oh, if Joseon had it too,
no need for an explanation then.

117
00:07:38,052 --> 00:07:39,935
Just stamp here.

118
00:07:41,503 --> 00:07:44,537
Here and here…

119
00:07:46,799 --> 00:07:50,276
Once you draw your handprint like that

120
00:07:51,157 --> 00:07:52,636
you and your descendants

121
00:07:52,636 --> 00:07:55,220
would live as servants
of that household for generations.

122
00:07:56,019 --> 00:07:57,651
What are you talking about?

123
00:07:57,651 --> 00:08:01,345
This is a standard contract,
a standard contract!

124
00:08:01,345 --> 00:08:04,011
Seriously, why would I do that?

125
00:08:04,611 --> 00:08:07,827
Of course, I know
you're not that kind of person.

126
00:08:13,806 --> 00:08:18,044
But today, I have somewhere important to be.

127
00:08:18,044 --> 00:08:19,867
So, let's talk after I return.

128
00:08:19,867 --> 00:08:21,373
Putting it off again?

129
00:08:21,373 --> 00:08:24,151
You said you'd give me an answer
after sleeping on it!

130
00:08:24,151 --> 00:08:26,457
I'll be back soon.

131
00:08:26,457 --> 00:08:28,758
Where are the clothes
I left with you last night?

132
00:08:28,758 --> 00:08:30,409
I washed them last night

133
00:08:30,409 --> 00:08:32,312
so they're still wet!

134
00:08:33,712 --> 00:08:35,661
How unfortunate.

135
00:08:50,616 --> 00:08:52,216
What's that?

136
00:08:54,157 --> 00:08:56,526
What am I doing here?

137
00:08:57,127 --> 00:08:58,707
Look at him.

138
00:08:58,707 --> 00:09:01,115
He's no ordinary fox.

139
00:09:03,881 --> 00:09:06,116
Mister, you're going the wrong way!

140
00:09:07,353 --> 00:09:09,295
Take a pick.

141
00:09:09,295 --> 00:09:11,208
How about this? Something trendy.

142
00:09:11,208 --> 00:09:13,376
Like a hipster. In a hip style.

143
00:09:13,376 --> 00:09:15,088
What does "hip" mean?

144
00:09:15,088 --> 00:09:16,549
It's this.

145
00:09:16,549 --> 00:09:18,902
The colors seem rather dull.

146
00:09:20,722 --> 00:09:22,682
It's dangerous. Move out of the way.

147
00:09:23,371 --> 00:09:24,713
- Wait!
- Step aside.

148
00:09:24,713 --> 00:09:26,768
How are you coming down?

149
00:09:29,666 --> 00:09:31,266
What are you doing?

150
00:09:33,588 --> 00:09:37,708
I've never seen such an array
of vibrant fabrics before!

151
00:09:37,708 --> 00:09:39,385
Welcome.

152
00:09:39,385 --> 00:09:40,672
Hello.

153
00:09:40,672 --> 00:09:43,459
I've been through too much
to let him slip away today.

154
00:09:43,459 --> 00:09:46,078
I will get my answer.

155
00:09:53,167 --> 00:09:55,212
To think such colors can be created…

156
00:10:01,871 --> 00:10:03,586
Mister.

157
00:10:03,586 --> 00:10:04,937
What about this one?

158
00:10:04,937 --> 00:10:06,537
This looks nice.

159
00:10:13,665 --> 00:10:17,298
I don't think it suits me.

160
00:10:17,298 --> 00:10:18,898
Why?

161
00:10:21,840 --> 00:10:23,543
How about this?

162
00:10:24,494 --> 00:10:26,488
How much is this?

163
00:10:30,347 --> 00:10:32,889
Come on, this is prettier.

164
00:10:32,889 --> 00:10:34,843
Are you only getting for the groom?

165
00:10:34,843 --> 00:10:36,330
Huh?

166
00:10:36,330 --> 00:10:37,901
You should get one for the bride as well.

167
00:10:37,901 --> 00:10:40,261
I'll give you a discount if you buy together.

168
00:10:41,232 --> 00:10:43,964
Bride and groom?
Now, that's just absurd!

169
00:10:43,964 --> 00:10:47,082
I can tell even from a glance.

170
00:10:47,082 --> 00:10:48,753
You're mistaken.

171
00:10:48,753 --> 00:10:50,473
Let's just go with this one.

172
00:10:51,192 --> 00:10:52,371
What do you think?

173
00:10:52,371 --> 00:10:54,111
That's a great choice. Looks amazing!

174
00:10:54,111 --> 00:10:55,289
- Is that so?
- Over there.

175
00:10:55,289 --> 00:10:57,953
- Try it on over there.
- Oh, over there? Okay.

176
00:11:06,285 --> 00:11:08,345
Oh, my goodness.

177
00:11:09,133 --> 00:11:12,361
They say clothes make the man, but wow...

178
00:11:12,361 --> 00:11:13,807
Bride, what do you think?

179
00:11:13,807 --> 00:11:15,572
Doesn't he look stunning?

180
00:11:16,645 --> 00:11:18,687
I'm not the bride.

181
00:11:18,687 --> 00:11:20,641
But then...

182
00:11:20,641 --> 00:11:25,420
Before the wedding,
you should something with his hair.

183
00:11:26,435 --> 00:11:28,299
Can I just get the bill?

184
00:11:43,441 --> 00:11:45,869
I was meaning to call you.

185
00:11:47,183 --> 00:11:50,200
Everything should be wrapped up in a few days.

186
00:11:50,200 --> 00:11:52,103
So go ahead as planned.

187
00:11:54,122 --> 00:11:55,552
Yes.

188
00:11:55,552 --> 00:11:58,826
I'll get in touch
after the advertisement meeting.

189
00:12:04,498 --> 00:12:07,762
I told you not to schedule anything
in the morning, I have low blood pressure.

190
00:12:07,762 --> 00:12:09,324
It's just for today.

191
00:12:09,324 --> 00:12:13,074
It was hard to adjust the time
because he had busy schedules.

192
00:12:13,074 --> 00:12:15,151
Let's get this over with.

193
00:12:15,151 --> 00:12:16,751
I'm exhausted.

194
00:12:17,991 --> 00:12:20,102
Tell them I'm not taking pictures.

195
00:12:22,256 --> 00:12:23,487
What?

196
00:12:23,487 --> 00:12:25,533
Is he also a celebrity?

197
00:12:25,533 --> 00:12:27,360
All together!
Let's take a photo together.

198
00:12:27,360 --> 00:12:28,879
- One, two, three.
- That's Chef Lee Hyuk.

199
00:12:28,879 --> 00:12:31,836
And he's also the advertiser
we're meeting today.

200
00:12:31,836 --> 00:12:34,517
You seriously don't know him? He's huge.

201
00:12:36,266 --> 00:12:37,938
Yeah, I can see that.

202
00:12:38,556 --> 00:12:41,922
Think this could land on Issue Patch?

203
00:12:41,922 --> 00:12:43,896
Issue Patch?

204
00:12:44,620 --> 00:12:47,808
I mean, standing next to him in a two-shot
doesn't sound too bad.

205
00:12:47,808 --> 00:12:49,827
What are you talking about?

206
00:12:50,730 --> 00:12:52,688
You said kids these days don't know me.

207
00:12:52,688 --> 00:12:54,575
So, it's time I let them know who I am.

208
00:12:54,575 --> 00:12:59,238
Nothing works better than a dating scandal.

209
00:12:59,238 --> 00:13:01,292
Let's hit the salon first.

210
00:13:01,292 --> 00:13:04,503
Hey, the meeting is in ten minutes.

211
00:13:04,503 --> 00:13:07,473
Come on, think!

212
00:13:07,473 --> 00:13:11,018
How am I supposed to fake a dating scandal
looking like this?

213
00:13:21,007 --> 00:13:24,553
How would you like your hair styled?

214
00:13:27,915 --> 00:13:31,047
One's body, skin, and hair
are gifts from one's parents.

215
00:13:33,259 --> 00:13:35,379
Yet here I stand, having lost my hair.

216
00:13:37,441 --> 00:13:41,670
I do not know how to atone
for such filial disrespect.

217
00:13:44,740 --> 00:13:47,970
However, as this is not Joseon

218
00:13:47,970 --> 00:13:51,984
if I were to tidy up what little remains

219
00:13:51,984 --> 00:13:55,479
perhaps I could redeem myself, even slightly.

220
00:13:57,789 --> 00:13:58,929
Now, your hair…

221
00:13:58,929 --> 00:14:02,299
How did you end up being
a pushover, Bong Eun Sil?

222
00:14:02,299 --> 00:14:04,752
You were always so shrewd with numbers.

223
00:14:06,564 --> 00:14:10,507
That fox must be a wily beast
that humans are no match for.

224
00:14:10,507 --> 00:14:11,898
That's it.

225
00:14:11,898 --> 00:14:14,225
I need to cut ties while I still can!

226
00:14:14,225 --> 00:14:17,470
There are countless talented chefs out there.

227
00:14:17,470 --> 00:14:20,101
Why cling to a homeless drifter?

228
00:14:22,930 --> 00:14:26,661
[Restaurant recruit]

229
00:14:27,682 --> 00:14:29,457
[Experienced talent ready to start immediately]
That's more like it!

230
00:14:29,457 --> 00:14:31,396
Why would I rely on some vagrant

231
00:14:31,396 --> 00:14:35,213
when there are seasoned professionals available?

232
00:14:35,213 --> 00:14:36,198

[Desired Working Conditions]
[Annual salary of 40 million won]

236
00:14:42,877 --> 00:14:44,577
It's okay.

237
00:14:44,577 --> 00:14:46,426
Let's lower the standards.

238
00:14:46,426 --> 00:14:48,589
A bit less experience
isn't the end of the world!

239
00:14:48,589 --> 00:14:52,103
Even a guy who's never set foot
in a kitchen can cook…

240
00:14:52,103 --> 00:14:54,308
[Entry-level]

241

Miss?

249
00:15:13,538 --> 00:15:15,251
Yes?

250
00:15:15,251 --> 00:15:19,515
Your boyfriend doesn't seem to understand me.

251
00:15:19,515 --> 00:15:22,171
How would you like his hair done?

252
00:15:22,171 --> 00:15:23,653
A trim?

253
00:15:23,653 --> 00:15:25,294
A perm?

254
00:15:25,294 --> 00:15:27,369
Color? Or just a style?

255
00:15:34,940 --> 00:15:36,540
All of it.

256
00:15:38,382 --> 00:15:41,132
Just do whatever you can.

257
00:15:51,484 --> 00:15:54,198
Why isn't she here yet?

258
00:15:54,198 --> 00:15:56,817
Is she turning down the advertisement?

259
00:15:57,568 --> 00:16:00,219
She seems to have her reasons.

260
00:16:01,205 --> 00:16:04,311
They begged us to wait a bit longer.

261
00:16:04,311 --> 00:16:05,911
What should we do?

262
00:16:15,826 --> 00:16:17,426
Young lady.

263
00:16:19,789 --> 00:16:21,534
Lady Eun Sil.

264
00:16:23,666 --> 00:16:25,266
Young lady!

265
00:16:42,209 --> 00:16:44,531
Mr. Homeless?

266
00:16:56,189 --> 00:16:57,789
Mae Chang!

267
00:17:02,214 --> 00:17:03,814
What the...

268
00:17:09,577 --> 00:17:11,177
Can I get the bill?

269
00:17:15,502 --> 00:17:17,777
Go, quick! Hurry up!

270
00:17:20,731 --> 00:17:22,331
Mae Chang!

271
00:17:30,115 --> 00:17:32,763
Why does he keep following me?

272
00:17:33,632 --> 00:17:37,126
Did you see that? I'm still popular.

273
00:17:43,856 --> 00:17:46,937
I can't believe my heart skipped a beat
for a drifter like that.

274
00:17:46,937 --> 00:17:49,320
Heart, you better self-reflect.

275
00:17:52,520 --> 00:17:54,138
Young lady.

276
00:17:56,001 --> 00:17:58,632
You finally see me now?

277
00:17:58,632 --> 00:18:00,063
What do you mean...

278
00:18:00,063 --> 00:18:02,381
You completely lost your mind over a woman

279
00:18:02,381 --> 00:18:04,889
and left me behind.

280
00:18:04,889 --> 00:18:07,135
Only to come back empty-handed?

281
00:18:08,199 --> 00:18:10,119
You must be mistaken.

282
00:18:10,119 --> 00:18:13,386
I thought I saw someone I knew.

283
00:18:13,386 --> 00:18:15,991
Wow, what a classic pick-up line.

284
00:18:15,991 --> 00:18:18,644
I bet even Joseon women
wouldn't fall for that.

285
00:18:18,644 --> 00:18:20,745
I'm serious.

286
00:18:20,745 --> 00:18:23,570
Mae Chang was an artist I cherished in Joseon.

287
00:18:24,938 --> 00:18:29,096
But why are you so upset?

288
00:18:29,096 --> 00:18:31,740
Do I not have a reason to be?

289
00:18:31,740 --> 00:18:33,724
Do you have any idea...

290
00:18:36,738 --> 00:18:39,739
how much money I've spent on you?

291
00:18:43,312 --> 00:18:46,231
Yet, you haven't given me a definite answer.

292
00:18:49,089 --> 00:18:52,229
I thought you did all that
because we were like family.

293
00:18:52,229 --> 00:18:55,295
Since when were we family?

294
00:18:55,295 --> 00:18:58,904
Forget that "like a family" nonsense!
It's canceled!

295
00:18:58,904 --> 00:19:02,562
From now on, this is strictly business.

296
00:19:02,562 --> 00:19:04,740
I understand.

297
00:19:04,740 --> 00:19:07,591
What a shame, I actually liked it.

298
00:19:08,673 --> 00:19:11,745
But then, what's "business?"

299
00:19:11,745 --> 00:19:14,382
It means we're only connected through work.

300
00:19:15,855 --> 00:19:17,951
So, give me a clear answer.

301
00:19:17,951 --> 00:19:20,232
Are you in or out of the diner?

302
00:19:21,357 --> 00:19:24,509
You're quite impatient.

303
00:19:24,509 --> 00:19:28,149
Didn't I say I'd give you an answer
after I got back from an important place?

304
00:19:31,837 --> 00:19:34,377
Where are you off to this time?

305
00:19:49,092 --> 00:19:51,042
I'm Jung Mi Sol.

306
00:19:51,042 --> 00:19:53,118
You must be Chef Lee Hyuk.

307
00:19:54,782 --> 00:19:56,356
Yes, I'm Lee Hyuk.

308
00:19:56,356 --> 00:19:58,898
Where are we having the meeting?

309
00:20:00,509 --> 00:20:02,366
The meeting...

310
00:20:02,366 --> 00:20:03,448
Is over.

311
00:20:03,448 --> 00:20:05,767
The scheduled time has passed.

312
00:20:05,767 --> 00:20:08,630
Chef, we sincerely apologize for being late

313
00:20:08,630 --> 00:20:10,532
but we should still have the meeting...

314
00:20:10,532 --> 00:20:13,809
You must be really upset.

315
00:20:13,809 --> 00:20:16,528
I should've apologized first.

316
00:20:16,528 --> 00:20:19,344
I'm sorry, we ran a little late.

317
00:20:24,026 --> 00:20:26,786
Precisely one hour
and forty-three minutes late.

318
00:20:26,786 --> 00:20:29,076
That amount of time isn't usually

319
00:20:29,076 --> 00:20:31,625
referred to as "a little".

320
00:20:33,584 --> 00:20:35,184
Please leave.

321
00:20:39,037 --> 00:20:41,050
Leave?

322
00:20:41,050 --> 00:20:43,984
Yes, please step out.

323
00:20:43,984 --> 00:20:46,696
I have to start preparing lunch service now.

324
00:20:50,471 --> 00:20:53,514
What are you all standing around for?
Get ready for lunch!

325
00:20:54,743 --> 00:20:56,473
We'll wait.

326
00:20:59,116 --> 00:21:02,493
We'll wait until lunch service is over.

327
00:21:02,493 --> 00:21:05,106
Since you waited for us

328
00:21:05,106 --> 00:21:08,438
it's only fair that
we wait for you too, right?

329
00:21:08,438 --> 00:21:10,811
We'll come back during the break.

330
00:21:12,414 --> 00:21:15,585
If you insist.

331
00:21:21,781 --> 00:21:23,395
Let's go.

332
00:21:27,220 --> 00:21:28,511
What?

333
00:21:28,511 --> 00:21:31,640
Changdeokgung is your important place?

334
00:21:31,640 --> 00:21:35,830
You spent all that money to look decent
just to come here?

335
00:21:35,830 --> 00:21:38,234
You sure grumble a lot.

336
00:21:38,234 --> 00:21:40,979
I told you there was no need to follow me.

337
00:21:41,711 --> 00:21:43,735
And if you ran off again?

338
00:21:43,735 --> 00:21:46,839
What, was I supposed to
just stand there like a fool?

339
00:21:46,839 --> 00:21:48,411
Ran off?

340
00:21:48,411 --> 00:21:51,044
I told you, I'm no shameless freeloader.

341
00:21:53,965 --> 00:21:56,399
Take that back at once!

342
00:21:56,399 --> 00:21:58,749
What's wrong with the weather?

343
00:22:12,344 --> 00:22:14,360
Excuse me, would you mind
taking a quick photo for us?

344
00:22:14,360 --> 00:22:15,535
Oh, yes.

345
00:22:15,535 --> 00:22:17,135
Thank you.

346
00:22:20,644 --> 00:22:22,918
One, two, three.

347
00:22:23,626 --> 00:22:25,226
I'll take one more.

348
00:22:27,108 --> 00:22:29,361
One, two, three.

349
00:22:31,854 --> 00:22:33,533
Thank you.

350
00:22:36,532 --> 00:22:39,067
Ugh, I knew this would happen.

351
00:22:39,067 --> 00:22:40,868
He ran off, didn't he?

352
00:22:47,379 --> 00:22:52,681
Your Highness, I, Gyosan,
may have traveled far from you

353
00:22:52,681 --> 00:22:56,851
my unwavering loyalty remains unchanged.

354
00:22:56,851 --> 00:23:01,876
I will find my way back to Joseon.

355
00:23:01,876 --> 00:23:05,653
Until that day, I wish you
peace and good health.

356
00:23:07,388 --> 00:23:09,452
What is he doing now…?

357
00:23:25,405 --> 00:23:27,383
Young lady.

358
00:23:27,383 --> 00:23:29,561
The one who just took a step back.

359
00:23:31,450 --> 00:23:33,367
Look at me.

360
00:23:33,367 --> 00:23:35,485
I am not a runaway.

361
00:23:37,168 --> 00:23:39,036
Looks like you aren't.

362
00:23:39,657 --> 00:23:43,332
Now that I have fulfilled my duty
as a loyal subject...

363
00:23:43,942 --> 00:23:46,434
Then, the diner?

364
00:23:46,434 --> 00:23:49,034
It's time to pay my respects
to my father as a son.

365
00:23:49,740 --> 00:23:53,122
Let's visit my late father's grave.

366
00:23:57,089 --> 00:23:58,305
And where's that?

367
00:23:58,305 --> 00:24:02,575
In Joseon, I laid him to rest in Yongin.

368
00:24:03,289 --> 00:24:05,978
But since the land has changed

369
00:24:05,978 --> 00:24:08,446
I'll need to find it first.

370
00:24:08,446 --> 00:24:10,241
Unbelievable! That's it!

371
00:24:10,241 --> 00:24:12,196
I'm done!

372
00:24:12,196 --> 00:24:15,113
Since when was I ever the devoted daughter
to protect my mom's diner?

373
00:24:15,113 --> 00:24:17,599
I was out of my mind!

374
00:24:17,599 --> 00:24:19,432
Go!

375
00:24:19,432 --> 00:24:23,445
Go ahead! Go to your father's grave
or Joseon or wherever!

376
00:24:24,410 --> 00:24:26,888
How about grilled mackerel?

377
00:24:26,888 --> 00:24:29,617
Oh, so now you're mooching a meal off me too?

378
00:24:29,617 --> 00:24:30,970
Do you even have a conscience?!

379
00:24:30,970 --> 00:24:33,766
I meant for our first menu at the diner.

380
00:24:33,766 --> 00:24:37,851
I wasn't planning on searching
for my father's grave today anyway.

381
00:24:38,606 --> 00:24:43,570
Before such a significant moment,
I wanted to pay my respects at the palace.

382
00:24:44,963 --> 00:24:49,736
Even if my country has fallen,
I'm still from Joseon.

383
00:24:51,012 --> 00:24:52,734
Then...

384
00:24:52,734 --> 00:24:55,662
You had already made up your mind...

385
00:24:58,039 --> 00:25:01,525
But still put me through all this?!

386
00:25:01,525 --> 00:25:03,836
You're unbelievable!

387
00:25:03,836 --> 00:25:05,446
Stop!

388
00:25:06,192 --> 00:25:08,359
People are staring.

389
00:25:10,205 --> 00:25:11,888
Let's head back.

390
00:25:11,888 --> 00:25:14,488
If we're opening tomorrow,
there's much to prepare.

391
00:25:17,396 --> 00:25:19,596
The weather is as unpredictable as ever.

392
00:25:21,878 --> 00:25:25,115
Time is crawling, seriously.

393
00:25:25,115 --> 00:25:29,666
If this dating rumor gets out,
I'm ending it immediately

394
00:25:29,666 --> 00:25:33,382
saying that I dumped him
in the cruelest way possible.

395
00:25:34,304 --> 00:25:35,939
Dating rumor?

396
00:25:35,939 --> 00:25:37,115
I don't think so.

397
00:25:37,115 --> 00:25:40,196
I feel like you've already hit
peak public disfavor.

398
00:25:40,196 --> 00:25:43,030
Let's just focus on the advertisement.

399
00:25:43,030 --> 00:25:46,528
Hey, even hate comments are still attention.

400
00:25:46,528 --> 00:25:50,133
That chef is already starting
to take an interest in me.

401
00:25:58,682 --> 00:26:01,069
Who dares to leave their palanquin
blocking the entrance?!

402
00:26:01,069 --> 00:26:02,634
How utterly thoughtless!

403
00:26:02,634 --> 00:26:05,605
The diner isn't even opening today.
Just leave it be.

404
00:26:05,605 --> 00:26:07,522
They'll move it soon enough.

405
00:26:07,522 --> 00:26:09,145
That will not do.

406
00:26:10,187 --> 00:26:12,203
Now that I have taken charge of this diner,

407
00:26:12,203 --> 00:26:15,216
I shall not be careless in anything.

408
00:26:15,216 --> 00:26:16,847
Yeah, yeah.

409
00:26:24,164 --> 00:26:26,273
Come forth!

410
00:26:32,279 --> 00:26:34,367
Come forth!

411
00:26:36,690 --> 00:26:39,193
I'm sure I sensed someone's presence.

412
00:26:39,945 --> 00:26:42,233
Why is no one answering?

413
00:26:44,202 --> 00:26:45,744
- This palanquin is so dark…
- Oh, my gosh

414
00:26:45,744 --> 00:26:47,136
so I can't see a thing inside.

415
00:26:47,136 --> 00:26:48,436
Oh, my!

416
00:26:48,436 --> 00:26:52,023
- Oh! That's the guy from the salon!
- Is anyone there?

417
00:26:52,023 --> 00:26:53,902
Did he follow me all the way here?
Is he a stalker?

418
00:26:53,902 --> 00:26:55,409
- Come out at once!
- I'll chase him away.

419
00:26:55,409 --> 00:26:59,617
Forget it. Dealing with him will only make it worse.

420
00:26:59,617 --> 00:27:03,345
This isn't his fault.

421
00:27:03,935 --> 00:27:06,027
It's my fault.

422
00:27:06,027 --> 00:27:10,601
Jung Mi Sol is a woman that is hard to forget
once you fall in love with her.

423
00:27:11,255 --> 00:27:12,316
Take a good look.

424
00:27:12,316 --> 00:27:15,250
This will be Chef Lee in the future.

425
00:27:18,606 --> 00:27:20,099
Look at them!

426
00:27:20,099 --> 00:27:23,670
If you've done something wrong,
the right thing to do is to apologize!

427
00:27:23,670 --> 00:27:25,766
They're so shameless...

428
00:27:27,095 --> 00:27:28,695
Let's go.

429
00:27:35,582 --> 00:27:38,094
We've reviewed the proposal you sent over.

430
00:27:38,094 --> 00:27:40,399
And we think the third option would work best.

431
00:27:40,399 --> 00:27:43,404
It aligns well with Mi Sol's image.

432
00:27:44,186 --> 00:27:47,100
The third option requires acting

433
00:27:47,100 --> 00:27:49,074
but you can't act.

434
00:27:50,148 --> 00:27:52,572
We did some research

435
00:27:52,572 --> 00:27:54,504
and it seems like the third option
would be difficult.

436
00:27:54,504 --> 00:27:57,431
Well... That's technically true.

437
00:27:57,431 --> 00:28:00,330
But did you have to be that blunt?

438
00:28:01,130 --> 00:28:05,706
Then, Chef Lee, what's your suggestion?

439
00:28:10,761 --> 00:28:12,824
Forget all the previous plans

440
00:28:12,824 --> 00:28:15,957
and let's go with reality.

441
00:28:15,957 --> 00:28:17,274
Reality?

442
00:28:17,274 --> 00:28:18,455
Yes.

443
00:28:18,455 --> 00:28:19,860
You'll eat my food

444
00:28:19,860 --> 00:28:24,618
and we'll capture your honest reaction as it is.

445
00:28:24,618 --> 00:28:26,847
Like a mukbang?

446
00:28:27,434 --> 00:28:29,532
Yes, something similar.

447
00:28:30,518 --> 00:28:32,223
That actually sounds good.

448
00:28:34,568 --> 00:28:38,618
But Mi Sol hasn't really done
anything like that before...

449
00:28:40,380 --> 00:28:45,006
That's even better.
It'll be fresh for the audience.

450
00:28:45,006 --> 00:28:49,063
Sorry, but that's not going to work.

451
00:28:51,153 --> 00:28:52,753
Why not?

452
00:28:56,810 --> 00:28:59,790
I've never reacted to food before.

453
00:28:59,790 --> 00:29:02,254
I have a very picky palate

454
00:29:02,254 --> 00:29:06,290
I've never thought
something's delicious after eating.

455
00:29:06,290 --> 00:29:07,414
That's true.

456
00:29:07,414 --> 00:29:10,163
I don't think I've ever seen her
really enjoy food.

457
00:29:10,163 --> 00:29:13,745
That won't be a problem.

458
00:29:13,745 --> 00:29:16,647
Because I'll be the one making the food.

459
00:29:20,643 --> 00:29:23,973
And what if it doesn't get
the reaction you're expecting?

460
00:29:25,874 --> 00:29:28,341
That won't happen.

461
00:29:28,341 --> 00:29:31,251
I guarantee that I'll make Jung Mi Sol say...

462
00:29:31,251 --> 00:29:33,884
"This is delicious."

463
00:29:42,087 --> 00:29:43,846
Mister, come over here.

464
00:29:45,165 --> 00:29:47,541
- This place has the cheapest mackerel.
- Welcome!

465
00:29:47,541 --> 00:29:50,631
Sir, can we get 50 of these?

466
00:29:50,631 --> 00:29:52,503
Will you give me a discount if I buy a lot?

467
00:29:52,503 --> 00:29:54,172
Oh, of course!

468
00:29:54,172 --> 00:29:56,092
How would you like them prepared?

469
00:29:56,701 --> 00:29:58,146
How should we?

470
00:29:58,146 --> 00:29:59,430
No.

471
00:29:59,430 --> 00:30:01,448
This mackerel won't do.

472
00:30:01,448 --> 00:30:03,004
Why?

473
00:30:03,004 --> 00:30:04,355
Look here.

474
00:30:04,355 --> 00:30:06,301
The gills are flared open.

475
00:30:06,301 --> 00:30:08,540
The color is dark brown.

476
00:30:11,149 --> 00:30:13,069
Let alone this fishy odor...

477
00:30:16,989 --> 00:30:19,729
And there's no firmness at all.

478
00:30:19,729 --> 00:30:22,219
I wouldn't eat this even if it were free.

479
00:30:22,219 --> 00:30:23,819
Really?

480
00:30:28,825 --> 00:30:29,952
Shoo!

481
00:30:29,952 --> 00:30:31,652
- Shoo, shoo!
- What's wrong with you?

482
00:30:31,652 --> 00:30:33,252
Shoo!

483
00:30:38,119 --> 00:30:40,198
How do you even know this stuff?

484
00:30:41,173 --> 00:30:42,517
Never mind.

485
00:30:42,517 --> 00:30:43,685
You'll just say...

486
00:30:43,685 --> 00:30:47,224
"This Transcendent Genius
never forgets what he sees"

487
00:30:47,224 --> 00:30:49,267
and go on and on.

488
00:30:50,256 --> 00:30:52,134
I learned it from my father.

489
00:31:10,758 --> 00:31:15,130
My father loved charcoal-grilled mackerel.

490
00:31:18,119 --> 00:31:20,543
Why the sudden shift in mood...?

491
00:31:21,516 --> 00:31:24,404
Is that why you suggested grilled mackerel?

492
00:31:24,404 --> 00:31:26,576
Because you couldn't visit your father's grave?

493
00:31:26,576 --> 00:31:28,820
Well, I also just wanted to eat it.

494
00:31:28,820 --> 00:31:30,605
Might as well.

495
00:31:34,262 --> 00:31:35,862
That's the one!

496
00:31:38,302 --> 00:31:39,902
Hello.

497
00:31:41,736 --> 00:31:44,688
These fresh, crimson gills,
this greenish sheen.

498
00:31:45,376 --> 00:31:48,288
This is exactly the mackerel
I've been looking for.

499
00:31:48,288 --> 00:31:50,892
[7,000 won per mackerel]

500
00:31:50,892 --> 00:31:53,414
But this is way too expensive!

501
00:31:53,414 --> 00:31:57,223
Then, are you suggesting we serve
subpar food on our first day?

502
00:32:00,545 --> 00:32:02,145
Can we get a discount?

503
00:32:10,692 --> 00:32:11,847
Since this is our grand opening

504
00:32:11,847 --> 00:32:16,490
we should serve red bean rice cake
to ward off bad luck.

505
00:32:16,490 --> 00:32:19,048
Do you even know how tight our budget is?

506
00:32:19,048 --> 00:32:22,657
We still have so much to buy.
Forget the rice cakes.

507
00:32:22,657 --> 00:32:25,443
In Joseon, it was customary

508
00:32:25,443 --> 00:32:29,139
to eat red bean dishes on important days
to drive away misfortune.

509
00:32:30,300 --> 00:32:32,084
Think about it.

510
00:32:32,084 --> 00:32:35,966
If you could ward off bad luck
with just a little money, wouldn't you?

511
00:32:36,615 --> 00:32:39,238
I don't believe in such things.

512
00:32:39,238 --> 00:32:42,783
Only weak-minded people cling to superstitions.

513
00:32:42,783 --> 00:32:44,383
Let's go, hurry up.

514
00:32:52,978 --> 00:32:54,931
These look delicious.

515
00:32:55,542 --> 00:32:57,438
I should add them to today's stew.

516
00:32:57,438 --> 00:32:58,904
Good idea.

517
00:32:58,904 --> 00:33:02,168
Sir, we'll take all the zucchinis.

518
00:33:02,168 --> 00:33:03,864
Thank you.

519
00:33:06,937 --> 00:33:08,537
Thank you.

520
00:33:09,423 --> 00:33:11,023
Have a nice day.

521
00:33:19,553 --> 00:33:21,647
We got the mackerel

522
00:33:22,440 --> 00:33:24,255
and zucchinis.

523
00:33:27,595 --> 00:33:29,135
What's wrong?

524
00:33:29,135 --> 00:33:30,993
Did we forget something?

525
00:33:38,745 --> 00:33:40,953
What is it?

526
00:33:40,953 --> 00:33:43,119
That old man...

527
00:33:43,119 --> 00:33:45,007
He's gone.

528
00:33:47,993 --> 00:33:52,004
You don't even realize
your own life is hanging by a thread.

529
00:33:53,624 --> 00:33:55,861
What do you mean?

530
00:33:55,861 --> 00:33:58,012
What did you just say

531
00:33:58,012 --> 00:33:59,586
about my life?

532
00:33:59,586 --> 00:34:04,805
Consider yourself lucky.
This mere treat just saved your life.

533
00:34:21,121 --> 00:34:24,022
He was right here… Where did he go?

534
00:34:26,680 --> 00:34:28,329
Welcome.

535
00:34:31,401 --> 00:34:33,569
- Can I ask you something?
- Sure.

536
00:34:33,569 --> 00:34:35,753
Have you seen the old man
who was selling zucchinis here?

537
00:34:35,753 --> 00:34:37,217
What are you talking about?

538
00:34:37,217 --> 00:34:39,864
That's just our storage area.

539
00:34:42,038 --> 00:34:45,687
Mister, do you remember
where red bean rice cakes were sold?

540
00:34:49,725 --> 00:34:51,340
We're going live?

541
00:34:51,340 --> 00:34:53,676
Of course, it's a live broadcast.

542
00:34:53,676 --> 00:34:57,413
How would we prove it's a reality
if it's not streamed live?

543
00:35:02,353 --> 00:35:04,907
Wait, and who are those people?

544
00:35:06,158 --> 00:35:09,010
We invited influencers in this field.

545
00:35:09,010 --> 00:35:13,565
They'll be eating the same dish as you
to help set the mood.

546
00:35:13,565 --> 00:35:16,271
You never mentioned that.

547
00:35:16,271 --> 00:35:19,200
Are you saying you can't handle
a little unpredictability?

548
00:35:20,435 --> 00:35:22,683
Aren't you a professional?

549
00:35:27,905 --> 00:35:31,129
If it weren't for that Issue Patch article,
I swear...!

550
00:35:31,129 --> 00:35:35,537
What do I do if I can't warm up
to my fake dating scandal partner?

551
00:35:35,537 --> 00:35:37,777
You look pretty today, so just endure it.

552
00:35:40,819 --> 00:35:44,893
Mom, I'm reopening the diner starting today.

553
00:35:46,250 --> 00:35:50,216
Turns out, this guy can actually cook.

554
00:35:50,216 --> 00:35:52,816
Guess even a dung beetle has its tricks.

555
00:35:52,816 --> 00:35:54,196
How dare you

556
00:35:54,196 --> 00:35:56,636
compare a Transcendent Genius
to a dung beetle?

557
00:35:57,832 --> 00:36:01,126
He insisted on visiting you

558
00:36:01,126 --> 00:36:02,974
so we came together.

559
00:36:02,974 --> 00:36:04,138
Madam.

560
00:36:04,138 --> 00:36:06,582
I'll be helping your daughter
keep the diner running

561
00:36:06,582 --> 00:36:08,383
so get well soon.

562
00:36:09,244 --> 00:36:11,186
Yeah.

563
00:36:11,186 --> 00:36:15,803
If you don't want to see me struggling,
wake up soon, okay?

564
00:36:19,444 --> 00:36:21,820
Visiting hours are over.

565
00:36:22,894 --> 00:36:24,298
Has it already been ten minutes?

566
00:36:24,298 --> 00:36:25,898
Yes.

567
00:36:27,465 --> 00:36:29,292
Mom, I'll be back.

568
00:36:44,213 --> 00:36:48,312
I haven't forgotten the meal
you generously gave me.

569
00:36:48,961 --> 00:36:53,511
How can I possibly forget it
when that meal saved my life?

570
00:36:54,165 --> 00:36:58,782
So now, I'll start repaying that debt.

571
00:36:58,782 --> 00:37:00,382
Mister.

572
00:37:02,982 --> 00:37:06,920
I won't let her struggle, so don't worry.

573
00:37:06,920 --> 00:37:08,641
Then...

574
00:37:08,641 --> 00:37:10,299
Wait for me!

575
00:38:08,310 --> 00:38:10,038
Okay, we're going live.

576
00:38:10,038 --> 00:38:13,319
Five, four, three.

577
00:38:27,146 --> 00:38:29,276
So gorgeous.

578
00:38:30,188 --> 00:38:33,259
[Dorae Taste Evaluation LIVE]
My hair and makeup are flawless.

579
00:38:34,365 --> 00:38:36,249
Ms. Mi Sol?

580
00:38:36,249 --> 00:38:38,255
Please focus on the food.

581
00:38:38,255 --> 00:38:39,476
[Where's the dress from?]
[Her hair looks amazing]

582
00:38:39,476 --> 00:38:42,188
[Worst actress ever]
[Need that dress info]

583
00:38:42,188 --> 00:38:44,062
Here's the appetizer.

584
00:38:44,062 --> 00:38:48,195
Its flavor is just as vibrant as the plating.

585
00:38:56,665 --> 00:38:58,394
It's delicious.

586
00:39:05,295 --> 00:39:06,709
[What does it taste like?]
[Dorae's food is top-tier]

587
00:39:06,709 --> 00:39:08,246
[Tell us what it tastes like!]
[It must melt in your mouth]

588
00:39:08,246 --> 00:39:09,603
[Wish I had a seat there]
[Save me a spot]

589
00:39:09,603 --> 00:39:10,894
[What's that?]
[I'm hungry]

590
00:39:10,894 --> 00:39:13,174
[Is that shrimp?]
[What is she eating now?]

591
00:39:18,368 --> 00:39:21,325
This dish is our hairtail gullim mandutguk.

592
00:39:21,325 --> 00:39:25,411
Enjoy the mandu first, then savor the broth.

593
00:39:31,125 --> 00:39:32,605
[Please describe the taste!]
[A taste test with no review?]

594
00:39:32,605 --> 00:39:33,791
[What's hairtail gullim mandutguk?]
[Never heard of it]

595
00:39:33,791 --> 00:39:35,043
[Intriguing]
[Wonder what it tastes like]

596
00:39:35,043 --> 00:39:37,218
[Is hairtail really inside the mandu?]
[Is the filling made with hairtail?]

597
00:39:44,524 --> 00:39:47,027
Mi Sol is eating well today.

598
00:39:53,976 --> 00:39:57,577
Mom, I don't feel good.

599
00:40:02,135 --> 00:40:03,735
Cut.

600
00:40:04,851 --> 00:40:06,855
She looks bigger.

601
00:40:06,855 --> 00:40:08,261
Yeah, she does.

602
00:40:08,261 --> 00:40:11,042
Director, she's a growing child.

603
00:40:12,233 --> 00:40:13,891
No one's managing this?

604
00:40:15,721 --> 00:40:17,465
Let's move on to the next scene!

605
00:40:17,465 --> 00:40:19,862
Bring the batteries here.

606
00:40:35,098 --> 00:40:37,761
She's gotten way too big.

607
00:40:37,761 --> 00:40:41,419
She was so cute as a kid, but now...

608
00:40:41,419 --> 00:40:42,919
Mi Sol's done for.

609
00:40:42,919 --> 00:40:45,009
Poor girl, really.

610
00:40:45,009 --> 00:40:46,804
She's only doing this
because her mom makes her.

611
00:40:46,804 --> 00:40:50,597
Exactly, it's always about the money.

612
00:40:50,597 --> 00:40:53,077
She's not even a child actor anymore.
She's junior now.

613
00:40:53,077 --> 00:40:55,688
Yeah, she could pass for a student now.

614
00:41:10,292 --> 00:41:11,437
[Why isn't she eating?]
[She suddenly stopped]

615
00:41:11,437 --> 00:41:13,797
[Mi Sol looks off]
[Why does she look scared...?]

616
00:41:14,468 --> 00:41:16,146
This is our signature dish.

617
00:41:16,146 --> 00:41:19,688
A Korean beef strip loin steak,
delicately infused with saffron.

618
00:41:19,688 --> 00:41:23,491
The plating takes inspiration
from traditional ink-wash paintings.

619
00:41:23,491 --> 00:41:27,098
First, feast with your eyes,
then take in the aroma, and savor the taste.

620
00:41:27,098 --> 00:41:31,014
All three sensations
come together on a single plate.

621
00:41:31,014 --> 00:41:32,710
Give me a moment.

622
00:41:32,710 --> 00:41:34,114
Just a moment.

623
00:41:34,114 --> 00:41:36,390
Can we take a break for a moment?

624
00:41:36,390 --> 00:41:38,691
We can't stop the broadcast.

625
00:41:38,691 --> 00:41:40,854
People will suspect it's staged.

626
00:41:40,854 --> 00:41:42,876
Please.

627
00:41:57,368 --> 00:42:00,088
The rice is cooked so perfectly,
I wonder who made it.

628
00:42:02,517 --> 00:42:04,117
We're all set.

629
00:42:13,192 --> 00:42:16,086
Get in line!

630
00:42:26,432 --> 00:42:28,582
Not a single soul.

631
00:42:32,013 --> 00:42:35,603
Did closing for a few days
really drive everyone away?

632
00:42:40,975 --> 00:42:43,808
We bought way too much mackerel.

633
00:42:43,808 --> 00:42:46,640
Not to mention all this rice.

634
00:42:46,640 --> 00:42:49,806
And that rice cake we didn't even plan for.

635
00:42:49,806 --> 00:42:52,366
What are we going to do
if we can't sell all this?

636
00:42:53,886 --> 00:42:57,709
How deep in the red are we today?

637
00:43:01,319 --> 00:43:04,671
Why do I keep running into people here

638
00:43:04,671 --> 00:43:07,031
who look exactly like those I knew in Joseon?

639
00:43:10,839 --> 00:43:13,656
I'm stressing over the business

640
00:43:13,656 --> 00:43:16,281
but look at you, all carefree.

641
00:43:17,771 --> 00:43:22,177
As long as you get paid, you don't care
if we have customers or not, huh?

642
00:43:25,362 --> 00:43:27,483
There's somewhere I need to go.

643
00:43:28,086 --> 00:43:30,686
You're on the clock, so no.

644
00:43:33,353 --> 00:43:35,273
I'll go and share the rice cakes.

645
00:43:37,451 --> 00:43:38,923
[If you don't want it, I'll take it]
[Why the long face?]

646
00:43:38,923 --> 00:43:40,462
[Wow, Korean beef strip loin]
[Korean beef never goes wrong]

647
00:43:40,462 --> 00:43:42,056
[Meat never disappoints]
[This is making me so hungry]

648
00:43:42,056 --> 00:43:43,310
[They even used saffron? Unreal]
[This looks way too good]

649
00:43:43,310 --> 00:43:44,436
[Huh?]
[What the?]

650
00:43:44,436 --> 00:43:45,475
[What's going on?]

651
00:43:45,475 --> 00:43:49,605
[The broadcast has ended]
[Thank you for watching]

652
00:43:55,593 --> 00:43:57,193
Mae Chang!

653
00:44:00,603 --> 00:44:02,365
Are you feeling unwell?

654
00:44:05,517 --> 00:44:07,146
I'll call the doctor.

655
00:44:07,146 --> 00:44:08,902
Uh, wait...

656
00:44:08,902 --> 00:44:11,404
My hair, hold my hair.

657
00:44:11,404 --> 00:44:14,047
Hair...?

658
00:44:15,922 --> 00:44:18,471
Then, please excuse me.

659
00:44:22,713 --> 00:44:24,329
Yes, sir.

660
00:44:24,926 --> 00:44:26,188
Oh, the live broadcast...

661
00:44:26,188 --> 00:44:29,181
I have no idea what just happened either.

662
00:44:30,478 --> 00:44:32,298
I sincerely apologize.

663
00:44:32,298 --> 00:44:34,726
Ah, that's better.

664
00:44:37,203 --> 00:44:41,052
Wait, aren't you that stalker?

665
00:44:41,052 --> 00:44:42,652
Do you know me?

666
00:44:43,601 --> 00:44:46,043
I know you, too.

667
00:44:46,043 --> 00:44:49,035
Mae Chang, do you remember me?

668
00:44:49,035 --> 00:44:50,355
Oh, dear.

669
00:44:50,355 --> 00:44:51,862
Jung Mi Sol!

670
00:44:51,862 --> 00:44:53,888
What do you think you're doing?

671
00:44:53,888 --> 00:44:56,598
Are you trying to ruin my career?!

672
00:44:58,263 --> 00:45:02,852
How do you plan to make up for this?!

673
00:45:05,206 --> 00:45:08,504
I don't know what happened

674
00:45:08,504 --> 00:45:11,486
but it's not right to push someone
who's clearly unwell.

675
00:45:11,486 --> 00:45:14,640
And what brings you here again?

676
00:45:16,148 --> 00:45:18,525
- Jung Mi Sol!
- Please!

677
00:45:20,261 --> 00:45:22,108
What's the meaning of this?

678
00:45:23,279 --> 00:45:24,879
Here!

679
00:45:26,190 --> 00:45:28,989
Have this to calm yourself.

680
00:45:28,989 --> 00:45:30,732
It's for our opening.

681
00:45:31,862 --> 00:45:33,462
Opening?

682
00:45:39,194 --> 00:45:41,529
Welcome. Are you here to dine?

683
00:45:41,529 --> 00:45:43,045
Yes, can I get the set menu?

684
00:45:43,045 --> 00:45:44,645
One set...

685
00:45:45,675 --> 00:45:48,239
Oh, right! He's not here.

686
00:45:48,239 --> 00:45:50,838
Seriously, this guy...

687
00:45:51,864 --> 00:45:53,715
Please wait here. Don't go anywhere.

688
00:45:53,715 --> 00:45:55,315
Okay.

689
00:45:59,216 --> 00:46:02,536
How am I supposed to find someone
who doesn't even have a cell phone?

690
00:46:04,359 --> 00:46:05,541
Huh?

691
00:46:05,541 --> 00:46:07,567
Isn't that Jung Mi Sol?

692
00:46:08,775 --> 00:46:11,657
Come to think of it,
I saw her at the salon as well...

693
00:46:13,619 --> 00:46:15,219
Mae Chang!

694
00:46:19,868 --> 00:46:21,987
Why, that mister...

695
00:46:23,563 --> 00:46:27,653
Mister, you can't just run after a woman
during work hours.

696
00:46:27,653 --> 00:46:30,121
Are you going to keep doing this?

697
00:46:30,121 --> 00:46:32,327
We have a customer!

698
00:46:35,631 --> 00:46:37,231
Chef Lee.

699
00:46:38,558 --> 00:46:40,144
I didn't know you were there.

700
00:46:40,144 --> 00:46:42,244
Eun Sil...

701
00:46:42,244 --> 00:46:44,168
What's going on?

702
00:46:44,829 --> 00:46:47,261
Am I supposed to believe
what this man is saying?

703
00:46:47,261 --> 00:46:51,478
You're reopening the diner?

704
00:46:51,478 --> 00:46:53,097
Well...

705
00:46:54,240 --> 00:46:57,327
Things got so hectic,
so I didn't get a chance to tell you...

706
00:46:59,029 --> 00:47:01,749
Mister, get back inside
and take the customer's order.

707
00:47:03,138 --> 00:47:06,032
I wanted to have a talk with him

708
00:47:06,642 --> 00:47:09,412
but let's save this conversation for later.

709
00:47:10,877 --> 00:47:13,921
I'll leave the rice cake here.

710
00:47:21,542 --> 00:47:24,970
I hope Mae Chang is okay...

711
00:47:29,632 --> 00:47:31,992
Oh, the customer!

712
00:47:31,992 --> 00:47:35,102
I've decided to reopen the diner.

713
00:47:35,739 --> 00:47:38,512
That man will be running the kitchen.

714
00:47:39,387 --> 00:47:42,747
Wait, Eun Sil, you can't be serious...

715
00:47:43,821 --> 00:47:47,231
You're really running the place with that man?

716
00:47:47,231 --> 00:47:51,272
We shouldn't have a vagrant like that
in our neighborhood!

717
00:47:51,272 --> 00:47:53,349
I thought we agreed on that?

718
00:47:54,158 --> 00:47:55,926
We did.

719
00:47:57,135 --> 00:48:00,253
I'm not usually this indecisive

720
00:48:01,093 --> 00:48:04,767
but he saved my mom, and...

721
00:48:04,767 --> 00:48:08,122
Right now, he's someone I really need.

722
00:48:08,122 --> 00:48:13,281
I thought you and I
were on the same page, Eun Sil.

723
00:48:16,172 --> 00:48:18,301
But I guess I was wrong.

724
00:48:19,825 --> 00:48:21,606
I'll keep him in check.

725
00:48:21,606 --> 00:48:24,403
I won't let him cause you any trouble.

726
00:48:30,714 --> 00:48:32,289
Just existing is a nuisance!

727
00:48:32,289 --> 00:48:35,551
The existence of that diner itself!

728
00:48:40,555 --> 00:48:43,177
Excuse me, sir.

729
00:48:43,177 --> 00:48:45,103
There's been an accident.

730
00:48:54,383 --> 00:48:57,096
The meal isn't over yet.

731
00:48:59,726 --> 00:49:01,773
Please take your seats.

732
00:49:01,773 --> 00:49:04,882
You should at least stay for the main dish.

733
00:49:19,916 --> 00:49:22,226
Rosy seabass, found in deep waters

734
00:49:22,226 --> 00:49:26,584
is a delicacy known for its rich flavor.

735
00:49:27,183 --> 00:49:28,904
The main dish of the day

736
00:49:28,904 --> 00:49:31,717
is rosy seabass hot stone pot rice.

737
00:49:38,703 --> 00:49:42,766
Wait, does this smell like mackerel?

738
00:49:43,399 --> 00:49:44,609
Mackerel?

739
00:49:44,609 --> 00:49:46,926
Oh? You're right.

740
00:49:46,926 --> 00:49:49,110
This smells like mackerel.

741
00:49:49,110 --> 00:49:51,331
Is this really rosy seabass?

742
00:50:29,511 --> 00:50:31,926
The restaurant is full,
so don't let anyone else in.

743
00:50:31,926 --> 00:50:33,540
Okay.

744
00:50:36,019 --> 00:50:38,257
Get in line!

745
00:50:53,282 --> 00:50:54,882
My man!
