[Animals were filmed under expert supervision

11
00:00:37,220 --> 00:00:42,334
Now that we have uncovered those conspiring
to enthrone Prince Yeongchang,

12
00:00:42,334 --> 00:00:46,177
all those who once stood behind him

13
00:00:46,177 --> 00:00:49,458
will cower in fear.

14
00:00:52,490 --> 00:00:57,140
If this has eased His Highness's concerns.

15
00:00:57,140 --> 00:00:59,937
I have nothing more to wish for.

16
00:01:00,827 --> 00:01:07,671
And to think that all those traitors
turned out to be illegitimate sons.

17
00:01:07,671 --> 00:01:10,925
How remarkable is that?

18
00:01:10,925 --> 00:01:17,513
We have triumphed without so much as
staining our hands with blood.

19
00:01:17,513 --> 00:01:22,698
Your acumen never fails to impress me.

20
00:01:24,839 --> 00:01:27,387
You flatter me.

21
00:01:29,847 --> 00:01:32,056
I suppose the blood of illegitimate sons

22
00:01:32,661 --> 00:01:35,835
is as clear as this wine,
so clear that you fail to see it.

23
00:01:37,811 --> 00:01:39,460
What?

24
00:01:40,104 --> 00:01:44,515
A great cause often demands
minor sacrifices.

25
00:01:49,006 --> 00:01:52,614
It's merely the reckless words of a lowly girl
who knows nothing of state affairs.

26
00:01:52,614 --> 00:01:55,107
So please pay it no mind.

27
00:01:59,187 --> 00:02:00,682
Speaking of which...

28
00:02:01,895 --> 00:02:06,732
When do you plan to conclude this matter?

29
00:02:09,657 --> 00:02:11,726

30
00:02:13,140 --> 00:02:19,395

32
00:02:21,182 --> 00:02:23,618
<i>I must return.</i>

33
00:02:29,170 --> 00:02:33,425
I must return and set everything straight.

00:03:00,378 --> 00:03:02,753
<i>Was I mistaken?</i>

35
00:03:02,753 --> 00:03:06,567

<i>If, by any chance...</i>

37
00:03:16,808 --> 00:03:19,826
<i>If she regains consciousness,
everything will be over.</i>

38
00:03:36,791 --> 00:03:39,208
- Hello.
- Oh, you're here.

39
00:03:39,208 --> 00:03:41,797
I was meaning to contact you.

40
00:03:41,797 --> 00:03:43,585
Pardon?

41
00:03:43,585 --> 00:03:44,982
Why?

42
00:03:44,982 --> 00:03:48,108
I'm afraid we'll need to free up the ICU.

43
00:03:48,108 --> 00:03:50,519
We're short on beds, and…

44
00:03:50,519 --> 00:03:53,932
There's nothing more
we can do for your mother here.

45
00:03:55,812 --> 00:03:59,134
Then what happens to my mom?

46
00:03:59,134 --> 00:04:01,231
Well...

47
00:04:01,231 --> 00:04:02,931
Excuse me.

48
00:04:16,434 --> 00:04:19,042
Mr. Lee Sang Cheol.
Mr. Lee Sang Cheol, are you okay?

49
00:04:19,042 --> 00:04:20,902
Mr. Lee Sang Cheol!

50
00:04:23,941 --> 00:04:26,705
Mr. Lee Sang Cheol, sir!

51
00:04:26,705 --> 00:04:29,303
Sir, can you hear me?

52
00:04:30,818 --> 00:04:33,244
Lee Sang Cheol, are you okay?

53
00:04:33,924 --> 00:04:35,898
Sir!

54
00:04:41,510 --> 00:04:45,006
What did they say about
your mother's condition?

55
00:04:46,798 --> 00:04:48,908
There's been no improvement.

56
00:04:48,908 --> 00:04:50,090
No improvement?

57
00:04:50,090 --> 00:04:53,525
No response or movement

58
00:04:53,525 --> 00:04:55,964
of any kind?

59
00:04:55,964 --> 00:04:57,625
None.

60
00:04:59,050 --> 00:05:03,223
They said continuing ICU treatment
is meaningless now

61
00:05:03,223 --> 00:05:05,803
and advised moving her to a general ward.

62
00:05:08,483 --> 00:05:13,516
Once she's moved, she'll need
someone by her side at all times.

63
00:05:13,516 --> 00:05:15,926
Then, what about the diner?

64
00:05:17,336 --> 00:05:20,182
Well, with Mr. Homeless gone...

65
00:05:20,182 --> 00:05:24,105
I can't run the diner alone.

66
00:05:24,105 --> 00:05:26,584
I'll have to focus on taking care of my mom.

67
00:05:27,307 --> 00:05:28,929
I see.

68
00:05:29,615 --> 00:05:31,710
Then, Eun Sil, let's proceed with the contract...

69
00:05:31,710 --> 00:05:33,549
Chef Lee!

70
00:05:33,549 --> 00:05:35,484
Could you pull over here for a moment?

71
00:05:35,484 --> 00:05:37,206
What?

72
00:05:48,520 --> 00:05:51,166
Hey, be honest with me.

73
00:05:51,166 --> 00:05:52,872
What's going on?

74
00:05:53,465 --> 00:05:55,045
It's no big deal.

75
00:05:55,045 --> 00:05:56,767
You didn't have to come all the way here.

76
00:05:56,767 --> 00:05:58,706
Cut the act.

77
00:05:58,706 --> 00:06:01,277
It looked like you were arguing with someone.

78
00:06:01,277 --> 00:06:03,681
You've been acting strange lately.

79
00:06:04,389 --> 00:06:08,290
Just some unstable civilian
has been pestering me, and that's all.

80
00:06:08,290 --> 00:06:12,333
I'll reason with him, so don't worry.

81
00:06:13,431 --> 00:06:15,215
You mean that, right?

82
00:06:15,215 --> 00:06:18,750
Yes, of course! Don't you trust me?

83
00:06:18,750 --> 00:06:22,083
You should return to the gathering
or you'll get an earful.

84
00:06:22,083 --> 00:06:24,465
Go on ahead. I'll be right behind you.

85
00:06:24,465 --> 00:06:26,018
Okay, don't take too long.

86
00:06:26,018 --> 00:06:27,469
Okay.

87
00:06:55,930 --> 00:06:58,094
Excuse me...

88
00:06:58,094 --> 00:06:59,896
We're closed.

89
00:06:59,896 --> 00:07:01,994
I just have a quick question.

90
00:07:01,994 --> 00:07:06,542
Have you seen an elderly man around here?
Short in stature, slightly hunched?

91
00:07:06,542 --> 00:07:09,022
You again?
Didn't you ask the same thing last time?

92
00:07:09,022 --> 00:07:11,315
I already told you
I've never seen anyone like that.

93
00:07:11,315 --> 00:07:13,055
Is that so?

94
00:07:24,017 --> 00:07:25,926
Excuse me, old man!

95
00:07:28,485 --> 00:07:30,143
Yes?

96
00:07:31,304 --> 00:07:32,883
Apologies…

97
00:07:47,187 --> 00:07:52,663
A thief broke into our diner
and smashed a jar my mom cherished.

98
00:07:53,694 --> 00:07:57,375
I wanted to see if it could be restored

99
00:07:57,375 --> 00:08:00,057
and also find out what exactly it is.

100
00:08:00,763 --> 00:08:02,449
I see.

101
00:08:04,820 --> 00:08:06,585
But I could've come alone.

102
00:08:06,585 --> 00:08:09,424
You've been stuck with me all day
and couldn't even work.

103
00:08:09,424 --> 00:08:11,452
You should head home, Chef.

104
00:08:11,452 --> 00:08:13,501
It's fine.

105
00:08:15,653 --> 00:08:19,043
You're making me feel bad...

106
00:08:19,043 --> 00:08:21,173
I told you I'd help.

107
00:08:21,173 --> 00:08:23,221
Don't worry about it.

108
00:08:27,075 --> 00:08:30,380
Do you think this will take long?

109
00:08:32,692 --> 00:08:36,061
I think it's a Joseon-era
white porcelain piece.

110
00:08:36,061 --> 00:08:38,368
Do you think it can be restored?

111
00:08:39,896 --> 00:08:43,551
My mom treasured it so much…

112
00:08:44,681 --> 00:08:47,541
How much do you think it's worth?

113
00:08:49,946 --> 00:08:52,296
It's got a couple of zeros.

114
00:08:53,449 --> 00:08:55,303
A couple of zeros…

115
00:08:55,303 --> 00:08:56,921
Is it 100 million won?

116
00:09:00,253 --> 00:09:02,048
Or 10 million won?

117
00:09:05,132 --> 00:09:07,222
It's worth 10,000 won.

118
00:09:08,687 --> 00:09:11,577
A mass-produced, low-grade piece.

119
00:09:12,561 --> 00:09:15,321
So, do you still want to restore it?

120
00:09:17,496 --> 00:09:21,029
Why did Mom cherish a jar
that was only 10,000 won?

121
00:09:21,675 --> 00:09:24,577
She must not have known.

122
00:09:27,825 --> 00:09:30,871
I guess this makes it awkward
to ask the police to track down the thief…

123
00:10:02,735 --> 00:10:05,986
Thank you for everything today, Chef.

124
00:10:05,986 --> 00:10:07,779
I'll head in now.

125
00:10:08,474 --> 00:10:10,334
Eun Sil...

126
00:10:11,919 --> 00:10:13,581
I'm exhausted.

127
00:10:13,581 --> 00:10:16,895
Can I have a cup of coffee before I go?

128
00:10:16,895 --> 00:10:19,508
Of course, come on in.

129
00:10:41,949 --> 00:10:44,516
Old man, show yourself!

130
00:10:45,595 --> 00:10:47,601
If you were the one who brought me here

131
00:10:47,601 --> 00:10:50,562
then surely, you're the one
who can send me back!

132
00:10:52,098 --> 00:10:54,421
I must return!

133
00:10:55,492 --> 00:10:57,974
The lives of my friends depend on it.

134
00:10:59,028 --> 00:11:01,394
So, please!

135
00:11:01,394 --> 00:11:03,927
Send me back to Joseon!

136
00:11:49,641 --> 00:11:51,800
Oh, my goodness!

137
00:12:25,425 --> 00:12:27,729
Who are you?

138
00:12:30,797 --> 00:12:34,001
Wasn't it you who came looking for me?

139
00:12:34,001 --> 00:12:35,479
Old man!

140
00:12:39,250 --> 00:12:42,755
All the memories I lost have returned.

141
00:12:42,755 --> 00:12:46,995
I now clearly remember what happened...

142
00:12:46,995 --> 00:12:48,692
before I ended up here.

143
00:12:48,692 --> 00:12:53,118
But I do not belong in this place.

144
00:12:53,118 --> 00:12:55,494
Please send me back to Joseon.

145
00:12:56,937 --> 00:12:59,038
I saved you from drowning

146
00:12:59,038 --> 00:13:01,904
and now you demand I grant your wishes?

147
00:13:01,904 --> 00:13:04,830
Was saving your life not enough?

148
00:13:05,617 --> 00:13:09,667
I cannot thank you enough for that.

149
00:13:10,417 --> 00:13:17,129
But I will not stand by
and let my friends die so I can live.

150
00:13:17,129 --> 00:13:19,496
I told you I would save your life.

151
00:13:19,496 --> 00:13:23,286
I never said I would send you
where you wish to go.

152
00:13:24,685 --> 00:13:26,521
I beg you, old man.

153
00:13:26,521 --> 00:13:29,126
There are people I must protect.

154
00:13:35,335 --> 00:13:39,342
And what can you offer me in return?

155
00:13:39,342 --> 00:13:41,337
What do you want?

156
00:13:41,337 --> 00:13:43,342
Name your price, and I'll pay it.

157
00:14:00,283 --> 00:14:03,817
Very well, I give you my word.

158
00:14:03,817 --> 00:14:05,556
So, send me to Joseon...

159
00:14:05,556 --> 00:14:07,054
One thing, though…

160
00:14:07,054 --> 00:14:12,088
If you return this time,
you will never be able to come back.

161
00:14:14,618 --> 00:14:16,244
I understand.

162
00:14:45,438 --> 00:14:46,479
You!

163
00:14:46,479 --> 00:14:48,837
You've been manipulating her!

164
00:14:48,837 --> 00:14:51,870
You were the one who harmed her mother!

165
00:14:51,870 --> 00:14:54,798
It's not worth listening to him anymore.

166
00:14:55,589 --> 00:14:58,055
Wait! Stop!

167
00:14:58,915 --> 00:15:00,313
Why?

168
00:15:00,313 --> 00:15:02,597
Have you changed your mind already?

169
00:15:04,086 --> 00:15:06,205
No.

170
00:15:06,205 --> 00:15:08,467
I will return.

171
00:15:08,467 --> 00:15:11,387
But there is something I must do first.

172
00:15:11,387 --> 00:15:13,579
Oh?

173
00:15:13,579 --> 00:15:18,443
But by then, your friends will all be dead.

174
00:15:18,443 --> 00:15:20,831
Then send me back to before they die.

175
00:15:22,459 --> 00:15:26,374
Do you think time bends to your will?

176
00:15:27,276 --> 00:15:31,399
As the moon waxes here,
so it waxes there.

177
00:15:31,399 --> 00:15:36,245
As the moon wanes here,
so too does it wane there.

178
00:15:42,457 --> 00:15:47,230
Your friends will be executed
on the night of the coming new moon.

179
00:15:47,230 --> 00:15:50,218
The new moon...?

180
00:15:51,593 --> 00:15:53,606
That's far too soon!

181
00:15:53,606 --> 00:15:56,289
So, make your decision.

182
00:15:56,289 --> 00:15:58,900
Will you return to their side?

183
00:15:58,900 --> 00:16:01,311
Or will you stay here?

184
00:16:04,122 --> 00:16:07,453
<i>Only six days remain until the new moon.</i>

185
00:16:08,143 --> 00:16:12,395
<i>Even if I return now,
I may not be able to save them.</i>

186
00:16:12,395 --> 00:16:14,067
<i>However...</i>

187
00:16:15,574 --> 00:16:18,065
I cannot return like this.

188
00:16:18,065 --> 00:16:20,208
Give me a few more days.

189
00:16:37,063 --> 00:16:38,685
I enjoyed the coffee.

190
00:16:38,685 --> 00:16:40,508
Thank you, Eun Sil.

191
00:16:41,589 --> 00:16:44,108
I should be the one thanking you.

192
00:16:44,108 --> 00:16:45,941
Drive home safely.

193
00:17:11,153 --> 00:17:13,973
Was this house always this quiet?

194
00:17:40,117 --> 00:17:42,727
So careless…

195
00:17:42,727 --> 00:17:44,954
What if another thief breaks in?

196
00:17:47,272 --> 00:17:50,284
This is why I cannot leave with ease.

197
00:17:59,533 --> 00:18:01,107
What was that…?

198
00:18:01,796 --> 00:18:04,715
No way, another thief?

199
00:18:20,424 --> 00:18:23,868
Is someone there?

200
00:18:27,523 --> 00:18:30,049
I'm calling the police!

201
00:18:58,167 --> 00:19:00,817
Fortunately, everything looks fine.

202
00:19:07,243 --> 00:19:08,924
Time for round two!

203
00:19:08,924 --> 00:19:10,346
Let's go.

204
00:19:10,346 --> 00:19:11,744
We had enough.

205
00:19:11,744 --> 00:19:13,792
But still, let's go for one more!

206
00:19:13,792 --> 00:19:14,702
- Second round!
- I'm in!

207
00:19:14,702 --> 00:19:17,595
- Let's go, let's go!
- Where to? Karaoke?

208
00:19:17,595 --> 00:19:18,744
Sounds good!

209
00:19:18,744 --> 00:19:20,102
We need to unwind today.

210
00:19:20,102 --> 00:19:21,973
What's this?

211
00:19:22,941 --> 00:19:24,639
Why aren't you picking up?

212
00:19:26,451 --> 00:19:28,424
It's my wife…

213
00:19:28,424 --> 00:19:30,518
She'll just nag me to come home early.

214
00:19:30,518 --> 00:19:31,769
Give it to me, I'll talk to her...

215
00:19:31,769 --> 00:19:33,712
No, no, no!

216
00:19:33,712 --> 00:19:35,485
I'll handle it.

217
00:19:35,485 --> 00:19:38,137
Why go the hard way?

218
00:19:41,674 --> 00:19:43,232
Yes, honey.

219
00:19:43,232 --> 00:19:47,481
I told you, it's a work dinner.

220
00:19:48,098 --> 00:19:49,619
What?

221
00:20:08,086 --> 00:20:10,488
You can't just barge in like this.

222
00:20:10,488 --> 00:20:12,839
Do you know how many eyes are on us?

223
00:20:13,873 --> 00:20:17,534
Didn't you say she was
neither dead nor alive?

224
00:20:17,534 --> 00:20:18,810
What?

225
00:20:18,810 --> 00:20:20,824
The owner of the diner.

226
00:20:20,824 --> 00:20:23,766
You said she was
unconscious and unresponsive.

227
00:20:23,766 --> 00:20:25,884
Yes, I did.

228
00:20:28,862 --> 00:20:30,610
She moved.

229
00:20:32,083 --> 00:20:33,550
What?

230
00:20:33,550 --> 00:20:35,660
I saw it with my own eyes.

231
00:20:35,660 --> 00:20:37,199
She moved.

232
00:20:42,416 --> 00:20:44,590
We should get out of here first.

233
00:20:46,555 --> 00:20:48,670
Let's talk somewhere else.

234
00:20:53,578 --> 00:20:56,567
I told you to keep a close watch on her.

235
00:20:56,567 --> 00:20:58,292
Detective Kang...

236
00:20:58,292 --> 00:21:01,152
Is there anything you can do properly?

237
00:21:02,934 --> 00:21:04,682
Excuse me?

238
00:21:17,293 --> 00:21:19,337
At the diner, Heo's Diner or something

239
00:21:19,337 --> 00:21:23,647
there was a break-in,
and I was investigating.

240
00:21:23,647 --> 00:21:26,143
And somehow, you're involved again.

241
00:21:29,695 --> 00:21:31,595
I had my reasons.

242
00:21:45,008 --> 00:21:47,478
I'm too anxious to sleep.

243
00:21:49,095 --> 00:21:52,590
This never happened
when Mr. Homeless was around.

244
00:21:55,125 --> 00:21:57,366
What are you saying, Bong Eun Sil?

245
00:21:57,366 --> 00:21:59,994
He's the one you should fear the most!

246
00:22:03,810 --> 00:22:07,225
Should I ask my friends to come over?

247
00:22:16,193 --> 00:22:19,045
<i>You have a new voice mail
Press the call button to listen.</i>

248
00:22:26,220 --> 00:22:28,674
<i>And who are you?</i>

249
00:22:28,674 --> 00:22:31,236
<i>Where is Lady Eun Sil?</i>

250
00:22:31,236 --> 00:22:33,680
<i>Please call Lady Eun Sil for me.</i>

251
00:22:33,680 --> 00:22:35,307
<i>Excuse me.</i>

252
00:22:37,383 --> 00:22:41,649
If Lady Eun Sil is there, please tell her.

253
00:22:41,649 --> 00:22:45,402
I'm waiting for her at home, worried.

254
00:22:46,646 --> 00:22:49,241
Please tell her to come home soon.

255
00:22:51,617 --> 00:22:56,655
<i>I must have troubled her by bringing up
what should've been left unsaid.</i>

256
00:22:58,000 --> 00:23:02,723
<i>Despite her tough front,
she's a soft-hearted lady…</i>

257
00:23:07,929 --> 00:23:10,220
What's with this mister?

258
00:23:10,220 --> 00:23:13,063
This is so confusing.

259
00:23:13,063 --> 00:23:16,869
Young lady, you can't let him fool you.

260
00:23:17,580 --> 00:23:19,721
Let's talk, just the two of us.

261
00:23:20,546 --> 00:23:23,526
What was he trying to say then?

262
00:23:28,830 --> 00:23:31,470
<i>Mr. Homeless.</i>

263
00:23:39,785 --> 00:23:41,453
<i>Hello?</i>

264
00:23:43,193 --> 00:23:45,053
<i>Eun Sil?</i>

265
00:23:47,243 --> 00:23:49,516
It's you, Mi Sol.

266
00:23:50,904 --> 00:23:53,646
I guess you're with Mr. Homeless.

267
00:23:53,646 --> 00:23:55,433
<i>Why are you asking about him?</i>

268
00:23:57,001 --> 00:23:58,653
Well...

269
00:23:58,653 --> 00:24:00,969
You kicked him out so heartlessly earlier

270
00:24:00,969 --> 00:24:03,592
so why are you looking for him now?

271
00:24:03,592 --> 00:24:05,458
<i>You're right.</i>

272
00:24:06,166 --> 00:24:08,635
<i>I shouldn't have called.</i>

273
00:24:08,635 --> 00:24:10,312
I'll hang up.

274
00:24:10,312 --> 00:24:13,128
<i>He's not here.</i>

275
00:24:13,128 --> 00:24:15,603
He left his phone behind.

276
00:24:16,208 --> 00:24:17,463
He wasn't feeling well

277
00:24:17,463 --> 00:24:20,708
but he still went back to Seonbuk-dong
because he was worried about you.

278
00:24:20,708 --> 00:24:22,478
What?

279
00:24:23,305 --> 00:24:26,074
If I were him, I would've cut ties with you
without a second thought.

280
00:24:26,074 --> 00:24:27,886
What's so great about you...

281
00:24:27,886 --> 00:24:29,207
Hello?

282
00:24:29,207 --> 00:24:30,801
Hello?

283
00:24:32,112 --> 00:24:34,030
Did she hang up?

284
00:24:34,734 --> 00:24:37,765
Ugh, this girl has no manners!

285
00:24:40,036 --> 00:24:41,571
Mister?

286
00:24:43,504 --> 00:24:44,885
What mister?

287
00:24:44,885 --> 00:24:47,165
Do you have some mister
I don't know about?

288
00:24:47,165 --> 00:24:48,725
That's not funny.

289
00:24:48,725 --> 00:24:52,761
Didn't I tell you to call before coming?

290
00:24:52,761 --> 00:24:56,885
I did, but you didn't pick up.

291
00:24:56,885 --> 00:24:59,079
What are you mad about this time?

292
00:24:59,079 --> 00:25:01,335
Why are you here?

293
00:25:01,335 --> 00:25:03,581
If you're not feeling well,
we can talk later.

294
00:25:03,581 --> 00:25:05,217
It's important.

295
00:25:05,217 --> 00:25:08,045
Just say it and go I'm exhausted.

296
00:25:09,029 --> 00:25:10,802
I came to give you this.

297
00:25:11,525 --> 00:25:13,244
What is it?

298
00:25:14,228 --> 00:25:16,604
A script?

299
00:25:16,604 --> 00:25:19,585
I told you I'm not acting.

300
00:25:19,585 --> 00:25:20,651
Take it back.

301
00:25:20,651 --> 00:25:23,217
I never said you had to accept it.
Just read it.

302
00:25:23,217 --> 00:25:25,972
- I'm leaving.
- Take it with you!

303
00:25:25,972 --> 00:25:27,767
Throw it away then.

304
00:26:11,913 --> 00:26:16,688
[Consideration: Concerns and worries]

305
00:26:18,807 --> 00:26:21,147
Why did you go to Heo's Diner?

306
00:26:21,954 --> 00:26:24,003
It was nothing.

307
00:26:24,953 --> 00:26:27,314
The door was open, so I stepped in

308
00:26:27,314 --> 00:26:29,698
and I accidentally broke a jar.

309
00:26:29,698 --> 00:26:33,344
Turns out it was just a cheap knockoff.

310
00:26:34,020 --> 00:26:36,896
So closing the case won't be an issue.

311
00:26:38,315 --> 00:26:41,131
You say things so easily…

312
00:26:42,402 --> 00:26:44,121
Well, fine.

313
00:26:44,121 --> 00:26:45,653
Let's say that checks out.

314
00:26:45,653 --> 00:26:48,617
But that man, Heo Gyosan,
or was it Heo Gyun?

315
00:26:48,617 --> 00:26:50,651
He knows what's between us.

316
00:26:50,651 --> 00:26:52,434
What are you going to do about this?

317
00:26:54,788 --> 00:26:57,237
It doesn't matter.

318
00:26:57,237 --> 00:27:00,608
No one's going to believe him now.

319
00:27:01,609 --> 00:27:04,528
So stop worrying about useless things

320
00:27:04,528 --> 00:27:08,213
and focus on keeping tabs
on the diner owner's condition.

321
00:27:11,010 --> 00:27:12,930
As long as...

322
00:27:13,555 --> 00:27:15,723
As long as she doesn't wake up

323
00:27:16,557 --> 00:27:18,928
everything will be fine.

324
00:27:19,601 --> 00:27:25,010
What the hell happened that day
between you and the diner owner?

325
00:27:25,010 --> 00:27:30,317
I need to know what I'm covering for
if you want me to defend you properly.

326
00:27:33,620 --> 00:27:35,751
Don't cross the line.

327
00:27:36,735 --> 00:27:39,674
Just do as I say.

328
00:27:51,686 --> 00:27:53,014
Huh?

329
00:27:53,014 --> 00:27:55,224
That's the chef's car…

330
00:27:55,224 --> 00:27:57,090
He hasn't left yet?

331
00:28:17,078 --> 00:28:21,083
Does Chef and Detective Kang know each other?

332
00:28:29,957 --> 00:28:31,977
<i>The moon will wane soon…</i>

333
00:28:31,977 --> 00:28:34,745
<i>There's far too little time.</i>

334
00:28:34,745 --> 00:28:36,391
<i>And on top of that, Lady Eun Sil...</i>

335
00:28:36,391 --> 00:28:38,512
<i>The one I can't trust is you.</i>

336
00:28:38,512 --> 00:28:41,293
Who are you, really?

337
00:28:41,944 --> 00:28:44,519
Tell me the truth.

338
00:28:44,519 --> 00:28:47,273
She doesn't trust me.

339
00:28:54,275 --> 00:28:57,167
If I fail to turn this around

340
00:28:57,167 --> 00:28:59,844
I cannot call myself a Transcendent Genius.

341
00:28:59,844 --> 00:29:03,066
I must settle these matters quickly

342
00:29:03,066 --> 00:29:05,596
and return to save my friends.

343
00:29:08,399 --> 00:29:10,990
Just hold on a little longer…

344
00:29:49,578 --> 00:29:52,848
Chef Lee, what a brilliant idea!

345
00:29:52,848 --> 00:29:55,811
Donating lunchboxes to the underprivileged.
How thoughtful.

346
00:29:55,811 --> 00:29:58,898
I'm flattered you're here to visit

347
00:29:58,898 --> 00:30:01,509
for something so insignificant.

348
00:30:02,378 --> 00:30:03,811
You donated such a large quantity of meals

349
00:30:03,811 --> 00:30:07,987
and at the exact time of the dignitary's
visit to the underprivileged.

350
00:30:07,987 --> 00:30:10,809
Of course, I had to come see you in person.

351
00:30:11,747 --> 00:30:16,586
Were you aware of the
dignitary's schedule in advance?

352
00:30:18,177 --> 00:30:20,991
If I overstepped, I apologize.

353
00:30:20,991 --> 00:30:22,411
Not at all.

354
00:30:22,411 --> 00:30:24,969
Even the dignitary will be pleased.

355
00:30:24,969 --> 00:30:27,011
And it reflects well on me, too.

356
00:30:28,867 --> 00:30:30,455
Thank you.

357
00:30:31,208 --> 00:30:33,863
Actually, I'd like to discuss
with you in private…

358
00:30:34,840 --> 00:30:37,337
Oh, what a shame

359
00:30:37,337 --> 00:30:39,212
I really should be heading out now.

360
00:30:39,212 --> 00:30:43,155
The menu for the state banquet
has been finalized.

361
00:30:43,155 --> 00:30:44,863
Oh?

362
00:30:47,131 --> 00:30:49,842
I'll only be available until late tomorrow.

363
00:30:50,647 --> 00:30:53,020
Then please stop by whenever you can.

364
00:30:53,020 --> 00:30:56,933
I'll clear my entire evening.

365
00:30:56,933 --> 00:31:00,450
Okay, then I'll give you a call
when I leave tomorrow.

366
00:31:00,450 --> 00:31:02,153
Understood.

367
00:31:06,582 --> 00:31:09,435
So, the guy who just left…
that was the Secretary-General?

368
00:31:09,435 --> 00:31:10,746
That's what they're saying.

369
00:31:10,746 --> 00:31:13,138
How does Mr. Lee know someone like him?

370
00:31:13,138 --> 00:31:17,941
Seriously, his business skills are something else.

371
00:31:17,941 --> 00:31:19,904
When did he manage to build
such golden connections?

372
00:31:19,904 --> 00:31:21,350
Exactly.

373
00:31:30,359 --> 00:31:34,638
Mr. Lee, what brings
the Secretary-General here?

374
00:31:36,542 --> 00:31:38,221
I'm...

375
00:31:39,812 --> 00:31:42,867
Set to be appointed as the head chef

376
00:31:42,867 --> 00:31:45,385
for the state banquet
hosted by the President.

377
00:31:47,502 --> 00:31:52,530
It will serve as a crucial platform
to introduce Dorae to the world.

378
00:31:52,530 --> 00:31:55,197
The day when Dorae
and the Korean Cuisine Theme Village

379
00:31:55,197 --> 00:31:59,533
become the heart of the Hallyu is not far off.

380
00:31:59,533 --> 00:32:01,219
Wow!

381
00:32:01,931 --> 00:32:04,846
But it's too soon to be impressed.

382
00:32:05,518 --> 00:32:11,094
There's even better news
that will delight you all.

383
00:32:12,523 --> 00:32:14,241
The final piece...

384
00:32:16,577 --> 00:32:20,985
of the Theme Village puzzle
has finally fallen into place.

385
00:32:20,985 --> 00:32:24,263
You did a great job, Mr. Lee.

386
00:32:25,146 --> 00:32:27,921
You never disappoint.

387
00:32:30,376 --> 00:32:32,576
This is all I have to offer...

388
00:32:32,576 --> 00:32:34,846
It might not be to your taste.

389
00:32:36,563 --> 00:32:38,313
It's okay.

390
00:32:47,694 --> 00:32:49,496
This is good.

391
00:32:49,496 --> 00:32:51,344
Really?

392
00:32:51,344 --> 00:32:54,033
You must be tired.
Go ahead and drink up.

393
00:33:06,929 --> 00:33:08,896
Want another?

394
00:33:08,896 --> 00:33:11,729
No, no, it's okay.

395
00:33:13,457 --> 00:33:16,039
Eun Sil.

396
00:33:16,039 --> 00:33:19,523
I know taking care of your mother
must be a heavy burden

397
00:33:19,523 --> 00:33:22,989
so I'd like to help lighten it for you.

398
00:33:33,878 --> 00:33:37,214
I'm sure your mother would want the same.

399
00:33:38,565 --> 00:33:42,085
Since we finally secured the diner
after years of waiting,

400
00:33:42,085 --> 00:33:46,064
I will create a Korean dessert café

401
00:33:46,064 --> 00:33:49,253
a place so remarkable
it will leave everyone in awe.

402
00:33:49,253 --> 00:33:54,562
I would like to thank you all

403
00:33:54,562 --> 00:33:56,958
for being patient and believing in me.

404
00:33:56,958 --> 00:33:59,374
I knew we could count on Mr. Lee!

405
00:33:59,374 --> 00:34:02,211
I've never doubted him once.

406
00:34:02,211 --> 00:34:04,291
So this was it…!

407
00:34:07,875 --> 00:34:11,252
This is why you harmed the madam.

408
00:34:21,340 --> 00:34:23,097
Mom.

409
00:34:24,167 --> 00:34:27,646
They're moving you
to a general ward this afternoon.

410
00:34:27,646 --> 00:34:31,247
Once you're there,
I'll be by your side all day.

411
00:34:31,247 --> 00:34:33,057
Isn't that nice?

412
00:34:37,208 --> 00:34:40,611
I sold the restaurant.

413
00:34:42,060 --> 00:34:45,760
Chef Lee offered a good deal.

414
00:34:45,760 --> 00:34:49,916
If this was how it was going to end,
I should've just sold it sooner.

415
00:34:52,183 --> 00:34:55,112
Then I wouldn't have met that mister…

416
00:35:02,543 --> 00:35:05,546
From now on,
I'll focus only on taking care of you.

417
00:35:06,747 --> 00:35:09,553
I'll make sure you wake up, Mom.

418
00:35:23,919 --> 00:35:25,602
Detective Kang!

419
00:35:27,429 --> 00:35:28,911
Detective Kang!

420
00:35:32,299 --> 00:35:35,487
I should've asked if he caught the culprit

421
00:35:35,487 --> 00:35:37,613
but we keep missing each other
since yesterday.

422
00:35:41,575 --> 00:35:43,601
I have something to say!

423
00:35:43,601 --> 00:35:44,771
You can't go in here!

424
00:35:44,771 --> 00:35:46,223
Let go of me!

425
00:35:46,223 --> 00:35:47,907
I said, let go!

426
00:35:47,907 --> 00:35:50,209
I must speak with him!

427
00:36:00,837 --> 00:36:02,997
[State Banquet Menu List]

428
00:36:06,110 --> 00:36:10,401
I knew you had your reasons
to harm the madam.

429
00:36:10,401 --> 00:36:14,057
However, was it all just to get
your hands on the diner?

430
00:36:14,057 --> 00:36:16,052
Is that why you left her to die?

431
00:36:18,817 --> 00:36:22,843
Yes, I took over the diner.

432
00:36:22,843 --> 00:36:25,851
But the rest of your claims are
nothing more than wild conspiracy theories.

433
00:36:25,851 --> 00:36:28,852
Eun Sil thinks you are the one responsible

434
00:36:28,852 --> 00:36:33,012
for what happened to the diner owner.

435
00:36:35,880 --> 00:36:42,413
That day, I heard music
at the scene of the accident.

436
00:36:44,246 --> 00:36:46,082
It was the alarm you set

437
00:36:46,082 --> 00:36:50,175
the one that rings at the same time
every day to wake you up.

438
00:36:51,417 --> 00:36:56,641
You were there at that very moment.
And yet, you didn't rush to the injured madam.

439
00:36:56,641 --> 00:36:58,827
Which means...

440
00:36:58,827 --> 00:37:01,813
you were hoping for the worst to happen.

441
00:37:01,813 --> 00:37:04,643
So you could take over
the diner without a hitch!

442
00:37:15,898 --> 00:37:19,551
If you're going to make such absurd accusations

443
00:37:19,551 --> 00:37:22,482
you'd better bring proof.

444
00:37:26,446 --> 00:37:30,681
Achieving your desires by all means...

445
00:37:32,371 --> 00:37:34,924
Gwansong was just like you.

446
00:37:37,227 --> 00:37:38,768
Fine.

447
00:37:38,768 --> 00:37:40,986
I will bring the evidence.

448
00:37:42,153 --> 00:37:45,134
Evidence so undeniable,
you won't be able to talk your way out of it.

449
00:37:57,148 --> 00:37:59,792
There's no such thing.

450
00:38:05,582 --> 00:38:08,940
This is my attorney.
He'll be assisting us with the process.

451
00:38:08,940 --> 00:38:10,788
Hello.

452
00:38:10,788 --> 00:38:12,359
Yes, hello.

453
00:38:13,305 --> 00:38:15,864
Let's discuss things comfortably.

454
00:38:15,864 --> 00:38:19,777
For the real estate transaction to be
fully completed on behalf of your mother

455
00:38:19,777 --> 00:38:22,448
you'll need a court ruling to appoint you
as her legal guardian.

456
00:38:22,448 --> 00:38:25,468
Since your mother is completely unconscious

457
00:38:25,468 --> 00:38:31,160
and you have no other family,
the process should move relatively quickly.

458
00:38:32,400 --> 00:38:33,934
I see.

459
00:38:34,631 --> 00:38:36,490
How long will it take?

460
00:38:36,490 --> 00:38:40,451
It usually takes around six months,
but I'll try to wrap it up within three.

461
00:38:40,451 --> 00:38:42,385
Three months?

462
00:38:50,449 --> 00:38:53,770
That's far too long.

463
00:38:53,770 --> 00:38:55,825
That's the standard time frame.

464
00:38:55,825 --> 00:38:59,555
I explicitly told you this is a priority.

465
00:38:59,555 --> 00:39:02,720
Did I not make myself clear?

466
00:39:02,720 --> 00:39:07,831
Do you think I'm paying your high legal fees
for this kind of delay?

467
00:39:11,711 --> 00:39:14,410
Get it done in a month.

468
00:39:15,685 --> 00:39:17,235
Chef.

469
00:39:24,710 --> 00:39:28,099
There are business matters involved.

470
00:39:28,852 --> 00:39:31,964
Was it that urgent?

471
00:39:31,964 --> 00:39:34,559
Why didn't you tell me before?

472
00:39:34,559 --> 00:39:37,463
You don't need to worry about it, Eun Sil.

473
00:39:38,961 --> 00:39:41,025
Attorney.

474
00:39:41,025 --> 00:39:42,896
Is it possible?

475
00:39:44,100 --> 00:39:47,633
Yes, I'll do my best to shorten it to a month.

476
00:39:47,633 --> 00:39:49,320
Did you bring the documents I requested?

477
00:39:49,320 --> 00:39:50,786
Yes.

478
00:39:58,560 --> 00:40:04,062
This is the agreement
regarding the real estate contract.

479
00:40:04,062 --> 00:40:05,798
An agreement?

480
00:40:06,728 --> 00:40:12,089
It includes the penalty clause in case
you decide to cancel during the review period.

481
00:40:14,674 --> 00:40:16,716
A penalty… ten times the damages?

482
00:40:16,716 --> 00:40:18,287
If the contract is terminated

483
00:40:18,287 --> 00:40:21,356
you'll have to pay ten times
the deposit amount.

484
00:40:21,356 --> 00:40:24,851
You're not planning on backing out, are you?

485
00:40:27,290 --> 00:40:30,047
No, of course not.

486
00:40:46,055 --> 00:40:48,185
I've sent 150 million won to you.

487
00:40:48,185 --> 00:40:49,792
Please check.

488
00:40:55,171 --> 00:40:57,168
[Lee Hyuk - Deposit of 150,145,000 won.]

489
00:40:57,168 --> 00:41:00,017
Yes, I received it.

490
00:41:03,113 --> 00:41:05,309
I guess there's no turning back now.

491
00:41:06,174 --> 00:41:09,576
Well then, I'll get going.

492
00:41:15,091 --> 00:41:17,482
I'll be on my way as well.

493
00:41:18,602 --> 00:41:23,324
Stay for some tea before you go.

494
00:41:23,324 --> 00:41:24,516
No.

495
00:41:24,516 --> 00:41:28,130
No, I wouldn't want to take up your time.

496
00:41:28,130 --> 00:41:30,284
I still have to clear out the diner

497
00:41:30,284 --> 00:41:33,047
and take care of my mom.

498
00:41:35,072 --> 00:41:40,487
You're personally taking care of her?

499
00:41:43,585 --> 00:41:49,300
I was thinking of arranging
a caregiver for your mother.

500
00:41:50,216 --> 00:41:53,045
I appreciate the thought

501
00:41:53,045 --> 00:41:57,292
but now that I have nothing else to do,
I'd rather just stay by her side.

502
00:41:57,292 --> 00:42:00,535
Besides, I have someone
who can check in when I step out.

503
00:42:01,702 --> 00:42:03,367
I see.

504
00:42:07,943 --> 00:42:09,951
Oh, by the way!

505
00:42:09,951 --> 00:42:13,367
About the break-in at our diner…

506
00:42:13,367 --> 00:42:16,639
Could you ask about it for me?

507
00:42:16,639 --> 00:42:19,125
I haven't been able to get in touch
with Detective Kang.

508
00:42:21,497 --> 00:42:23,216
Me?

509
00:42:24,868 --> 00:42:28,094
I can't reach Detective Kang.

510
00:42:28,094 --> 00:42:30,185
You know Detective Kang, right?

511
00:42:32,835 --> 00:42:34,876
No.

512
00:42:34,876 --> 00:42:36,871
Who is he?

513
00:42:38,460 --> 00:42:40,197
You don't know him?

514
00:42:40,835 --> 00:42:43,686
- But yesterday...
- I don't know...

515
00:42:43,686 --> 00:42:45,377
anyone by that name.

516
00:42:46,112 --> 00:42:49,123
I see

517
00:42:49,123 --> 00:42:51,432
I must've been mistaken.

518
00:43:06,245 --> 00:43:09,387
<i>That's far too long.</i>

519
00:43:09,387 --> 00:43:14,855
Do you think I'm paying your high legal fees
for this kind of delay?

520
00:43:14,855 --> 00:43:18,263
<i>I never expected to see
that side of Chef Lee…</i>

521
00:43:18,858 --> 00:43:21,680
<i>What could be so urgent?</i>

522
00:43:21,680 --> 00:43:24,053
You know Detective Kang, right?

523
00:43:26,485 --> 00:43:28,460
No.

524
00:43:28,460 --> 00:43:30,367
<i>Who is he?</i>

525
00:43:31,172 --> 00:43:34,018
I'm sure it was the chef's car.

526
00:43:35,132 --> 00:43:37,648
I couldn't have been mistaken.

527
00:44:06,001 --> 00:44:06,990
Mister!

528
00:44:06,990 --> 00:44:10,960
Mae Chang, I'm here to retrieve
the phone I left behind.

529
00:44:10,960 --> 00:44:12,253
What?

530
00:44:12,253 --> 00:44:15,778
Can't you just say that you're here
because you missed me?

531
00:44:15,778 --> 00:44:17,968
That is also true.

532
00:44:17,968 --> 00:44:20,668
I had to twist your arm to hear that.

533
00:44:21,324 --> 00:44:25,331
Thank you. This is essential for what I must do.

534
00:44:25,331 --> 00:44:26,731
But then...

535
00:44:26,731 --> 00:44:28,771
I'm hungry.

536
00:44:35,120 --> 00:44:38,844
There's nothing I can do for you
because you have no ingredients at home.

537
00:44:40,869 --> 00:44:44,344
Mae Chang, instead of starving,
use sesame oil and salt

538
00:44:44,344 --> 00:44:46,951
to make rice balls like this.

539
00:44:46,951 --> 00:44:49,956
Here, go ahead.

540
00:44:49,956 --> 00:44:53,473
No, I'll just eat what you make me.

541
00:44:55,967 --> 00:44:59,567
I'm telling you this
because I can't cook for you anymore.

542
00:44:59,567 --> 00:45:01,153
Why?

543
00:45:02,034 --> 00:45:05,404
Because I'm leaving this place.

544
00:45:05,404 --> 00:45:07,709
You got a job, didn't you?!

545
00:45:07,709 --> 00:45:11,239
Which restaurant? I'll come visit you.

546
00:45:11,239 --> 00:45:13,370
It's a place you can't come to.

547
00:45:13,370 --> 00:45:15,147
How far is it?

548
00:45:15,147 --> 00:45:17,175
Somewhere in the countryside?

549
00:45:18,006 --> 00:45:21,024
Or are you going abroad?

550
00:45:21,024 --> 00:45:23,164
Much farther than that.

551
00:45:23,164 --> 00:45:27,167
Then, just find a new job in Korea.
I'll help you look.

552
00:45:31,749 --> 00:45:33,488
I must go.

553
00:45:33,488 --> 00:45:37,062
So, learn how to cook for yourself.

554
00:45:37,062 --> 00:45:39,647
You must never skip your meals.

555
00:45:40,541 --> 00:45:43,109
Way to kill my appetite…

556
00:45:44,649 --> 00:45:47,070
You'll change your mind after you taste it.

557
00:45:50,973 --> 00:45:54,191
Come, let's eat before it gets cold.

558
00:45:57,812 --> 00:46:00,194
What's that?

559
00:46:00,194 --> 00:46:01,825
Nothing important.

560
00:46:02,514 --> 00:46:04,310
It looked like a book.

561
00:46:04,310 --> 00:46:09,313
I got offered a role in a movie…

562
00:46:10,161 --> 00:46:12,364
But I'm not going to take it

563
00:46:12,364 --> 00:46:14,664
because I'll probably ruin it again.

564
00:46:14,664 --> 00:46:15,864
Nonsense!

565
00:46:15,864 --> 00:46:17,995
How can you say that without even trying?

566
00:46:17,995 --> 00:46:20,625
I know myself better than anyone.

567
00:46:21,285 --> 00:46:26,695
They'll just mock me for bad acting again
because of another crying scene, anyway.

568
00:46:26,695 --> 00:46:28,878
So you're afraid.

569
00:46:28,878 --> 00:46:32,094
Whatever, let's just eat.

570
00:46:38,577 --> 00:46:41,163
Wait, this is really just
sesame oil and salt?

571
00:46:41,163 --> 00:46:43,792
It's so good!

572
00:46:43,792 --> 00:46:48,562
Before coming here,
I never knew I could cook.

573
00:46:48,562 --> 00:46:53,246
I was reluctant even to enter the kitchen.

574
00:46:53,246 --> 00:46:56,775
But once I did,
I realized it was nothing at all.

575
00:46:56,775 --> 00:47:01,993
If I had let my hesitation stop me,
I wouldn't be here now

576
00:47:01,993 --> 00:47:05,694
sharing this meal with you.

577
00:47:27,492 --> 00:47:29,019
Miss.

578
00:47:29,797 --> 00:47:31,070
Hello.

579
00:47:31,070 --> 00:47:33,591
I stopped by during shift change.

580
00:47:33,591 --> 00:47:35,993
How's your mother doing?

581
00:47:35,993 --> 00:47:37,768
Yes.

582
00:47:37,768 --> 00:47:40,450
She seems calm…
Almost like she doesn't even realize

583
00:47:40,450 --> 00:47:42,233
she's in a different room.

584
00:47:43,287 --> 00:47:46,548
By the way, did her nephew leave?

585
00:47:46,548 --> 00:47:48,051
Pardon?

586
00:47:48,051 --> 00:47:49,814
Nephew?

587
00:47:49,814 --> 00:47:52,146
He visited this morning as well.

588
00:47:53,303 --> 00:47:55,352
- He came to see my mom?
- Yes.

589
00:47:55,352 --> 00:47:59,384
He asked when she'd be moved,
so I assumed he'd be here.

590
00:48:00,589 --> 00:48:06,751
What does he look like?

591
00:48:11,333 --> 00:48:15,073
Mister, do you have to go?

592
00:48:17,641 --> 00:48:19,452
I do.

593
00:48:21,560 --> 00:48:23,420
Thank you for everything.

594
00:48:23,420 --> 00:48:27,124
Why are you talking like
we'll never see each other again?

595
00:48:27,124 --> 00:48:31,074
Even if you're going overseas,
it's just a few hours away.

596
00:48:32,084 --> 00:48:33,809
Give me your phone.

597
00:48:40,188 --> 00:48:44,458
I saved my phone so you can call me.

598
00:48:44,458 --> 00:48:46,781
And if you ever get curious about
what I'm up to

599
00:48:46,781 --> 00:48:50,296
just search "Jung Mi Sol".

600
00:48:50,296 --> 00:48:52,508
Like this.

601
00:48:52,508 --> 00:48:55,601
You can look me up like this, okay?

602
00:48:57,045 --> 00:48:59,277
So many words and pictures…

603
00:49:00,102 --> 00:49:02,764
If I type in my name,
will things about me show up as well?

604
00:49:02,764 --> 00:49:04,706
Come on, your name won't show any results.

605
00:49:04,706 --> 00:49:07,960
This is only possible for
celebrities like me... So...

606
00:49:07,960 --> 00:49:11,556
Only famous people can be searched for.

607
00:49:11,556 --> 00:49:13,322
Is that so?

608
00:49:14,447 --> 00:49:17,162
Be sure to call me.

609
00:49:17,162 --> 00:49:20,313
And return as soon as possible.

610
00:49:22,731 --> 00:49:25,044
That might not be possible.

611
00:49:25,790 --> 00:49:30,214
Stay healthy without any regrets, Mae Chang.

612
00:49:30,214 --> 00:49:31,829
I mean,

613
00:49:33,051 --> 00:49:35,117
Lady Mi Sol.

614
00:49:42,584 --> 00:49:46,115
<i>He looked to be in his late 30s…</i>

615
00:49:46,779 --> 00:49:50,829
<i>Quite tall, with sharp, striking features.</i>

616
00:49:51,853 --> 00:49:54,781
<i>This morning, he was wearing
a navy padded jacket.</i>

617
00:49:57,207 --> 00:49:59,000
Detective Kang!

618
00:50:00,807 --> 00:50:02,677
Detective Kang.

619
00:50:04,307 --> 00:50:08,115
<i>Why would Detective Kang
pretend to be my mom's nephew?</i>

620
00:50:16,019 --> 00:50:18,416
You've been manipulating her!

621
00:50:18,416 --> 00:50:20,880
You were the one who harmed her mother!

622
00:50:20,880 --> 00:50:24,508
What if he was telling the truth

623
00:50:24,508 --> 00:50:27,143
and the chef was lying?

624
00:50:30,543 --> 00:50:34,234
That would mean
he really did come from Joseon.

625
00:50:35,304 --> 00:50:37,090
That's ridiculous.

626
00:50:46,710 --> 00:50:48,321
Excuse me...

627
00:50:49,934 --> 00:50:54,216
Oh, you're the owner of the 10,000-won jar.

628
00:50:54,216 --> 00:50:56,493
Are you here to restore your jar?

629
00:50:56,493 --> 00:50:59,954
No, this time, I brought this.

630
00:51:01,633 --> 00:51:03,340
It's a new book.

631
00:51:37,311 --> 00:51:40,680
Just from this, I could learn everything
there is to know about Lady Mi Sol.

632
00:51:47,571 --> 00:51:49,308
Oh! Oops!

633
00:51:58,418 --> 00:52:00,432
Wait.

634
00:52:00,432 --> 00:52:04,182

candidate for the Blue House state banquet.]

639
00:52:27,565 --> 00:52:30,738
I cannot give a value to this.

640
00:52:32,264 --> 00:52:33,741
As I expected.

641
00:52:33,741 --> 00:52:35,815
Is that so?

642
00:52:35,815 --> 00:52:37,673
This is "Domundaejak".

643
00:52:38,331 --> 00:52:41,211
It was written over 400 years ago

644
00:52:41,211 --> 00:52:45,561
and only the manuscripts remain to this date.

645
00:52:45,561 --> 00:52:47,540
But this...

646
00:52:47,540 --> 00:52:51,007
This seems to be the original version,
no matter how much I look at it.

647
00:52:51,007 --> 00:52:55,262
Let alone the content, this handwriting...

648
00:52:55,262 --> 00:52:57,889
The paper looks new

649
00:52:58,474 --> 00:53:02,791
but it's undoubtedly a technique
used during the mid-Joseon Dynasty.

650
00:53:04,803 --> 00:53:07,545
Then, the person who wrote this is...

651
00:53:07,545 --> 00:53:09,060
Heo Gyun!

652
00:53:10,919 --> 00:53:12,539
Look.

653
00:53:13,242 --> 00:53:18,160
Where did you get this?

654
00:53:18,873 --> 00:53:20,750
Can I take the book back?

655
00:53:20,750 --> 00:53:23,088
What have you done?

656
00:53:23,088 --> 00:53:26,752
How did you store a book
from 400 years ago

657
00:53:26,752 --> 00:53:29,693
to make it look like it was written
only a few days ago?

658
00:53:29,693 --> 00:53:31,639
Give it to me.

659
00:53:31,639 --> 00:53:33,556
How much do you want?

660
00:53:33,556 --> 00:53:35,666
Tell me, I'll give you as much as you want.

661
00:53:35,666 --> 00:53:37,565
Oh, give it to me!

662
00:53:37,565 --> 00:53:39,967
I need to return it.

663
00:53:42,492 --> 00:53:44,768
