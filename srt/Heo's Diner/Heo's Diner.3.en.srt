And yet, Gyosan's words move me today.

shortage of talent since the war?

Does it trouble you as well
that I was born of a concubine?

183
00:13:17,675 --> 00:13:21,024
Perish the thought, Your Highness.

184
00:13:21,024 --> 00:13:25,220
You, of all people, have always
recoiled at the idea of illegitimate sons.

185
00:13:25,220 --> 00:13:30,351
And yet, despite Prince Yeongchang
being the rightful heir to the throne,

186
00:13:30,351 --> 00:13:33,080
not once have you entertained
treasonous thoughts?

187
00:13:33,080 --> 00:13:35,769
Your Highness was rightfully enthroned

188
00:13:35,769 --> 00:13:38,464
by the late king himself.

189
00:13:38,464 --> 00:13:40,077
No one...

190
00:13:41,691 --> 00:13:44,383
No one would dare harbor such disloyalty.

191
00:13:44,383 --> 00:13:46,610
Yet my father, even in his final moments

192
00:13:47,495 --> 00:13:50,017
clung only to Yeongchang.

193
00:13:50,017 --> 00:13:55,194
Had Yeongchang been a little older, I…

194
00:13:55,194 --> 00:13:58,419
Your Highness, trust in me.

195
00:13:58,419 --> 00:14:01,281
I will root out every last speck

196
00:14:01,281 --> 00:14:04,135
of defiance before you.

197
00:14:11,596 --> 00:14:15,316
Inspector General, I'm here to report.

198
00:14:15,316 --> 00:14:17,244
What is the situation?

199
00:14:17,244 --> 00:14:21,130
Have the so-called
Seven Riverside Friends confessed?

200
00:14:22,457 --> 00:14:24,381
My apologies, sir.

201
00:14:24,381 --> 00:14:26,822
They have endured three days
and nights of interrogation

202
00:14:26,822 --> 00:14:29,104
but refuse to speak.

203
00:14:32,605 --> 00:14:35,333
Then push them harder.

204
00:14:35,333 --> 00:14:37,300
Until Prince Yeongchang's name

205
00:14:38,117 --> 00:14:40,791
leaves their lips.

206
00:14:40,791 --> 00:14:42,597
Understood, sir.

207
00:14:48,823 --> 00:14:51,163
Wait, speaking of which...

208
00:14:51,893 --> 00:14:57,367
Mae Chang, weren't you
acquainted with those seven?

209
00:14:57,367 --> 00:14:59,289
Well...

210
00:14:59,289 --> 00:15:04,320
I merely filled their cups
as a gisaeng, nothing more.

211
00:15:06,048 --> 00:15:07,709
I see.

212
00:15:07,709 --> 00:15:10,917
It's best to keep your distance
from traitors like them.

213
00:15:10,917 --> 00:15:13,341
I'd hate to see their misfortune

214
00:15:13,341 --> 00:15:16,055
drag you down with them.

215
00:15:16,055 --> 00:15:17,710
Sir...

216
00:15:19,991 --> 00:15:21,591
Oh, dear.

217
00:15:22,321 --> 00:15:25,301
Your face is clouded with worry.

218
00:15:26,507 --> 00:15:30,849
If you want to resent someone,
resent Gyosan, not me.

219
00:15:30,849 --> 00:15:34,169
Had he only listened to me back then

220
00:15:34,169 --> 00:15:38,228
those illegitimate sons wouldn't have been
branded as traitors.

221
00:15:40,231 --> 00:15:45,884
Gyosan, if you become someone
His Highness cannot do without.

222
00:15:45,884 --> 00:15:49,727
Then, His Highness will call for me.

223
00:15:51,773 --> 00:15:54,891
Tell me, what does His Highness need?

224
00:15:54,891 --> 00:15:56,901
I'll do whatever I can.

225
00:16:04,925 --> 00:16:09,496
Lately, His Highness has been
unable to sleep through the night.

226
00:16:10,795 --> 00:16:14,845
Even before you were exiled,
the signs were there

227
00:16:15,706 --> 00:16:18,428
but it has only worsened over time.

228
00:16:21,232 --> 00:16:23,386
That is troubling indeed.

229
00:16:26,624 --> 00:16:28,807
What is the cause?

230
00:16:30,718 --> 00:16:33,196
Worry, what else?

231
00:16:33,196 --> 00:16:37,880
There are still factions within the palace
loyal to Prince Yeongchang.

232
00:16:37,880 --> 00:16:41,599
As long as they remain,
His Highness will never be at peace.

233
00:16:41,599 --> 00:16:44,906
But I thought most of them

234
00:16:44,906 --> 00:16:47,291
had already been purged.

235
00:16:47,291 --> 00:16:50,165
As long as the seed of treason remains.

236
00:16:50,165 --> 00:16:53,390
His Highness's worries will never fade.

237
00:16:54,249 --> 00:16:55,855
Which is why…

238
00:16:59,228 --> 00:17:03,422
I need you to root it out.

239
00:17:04,129 --> 00:17:06,751
Are you suggesting... the prince?

240
00:17:10,704 --> 00:17:12,656
You're not serious, are you?

241
00:17:13,755 --> 00:17:18,438
Have I ever been anything but serious?

242
00:17:19,609 --> 00:17:22,605
It's just… too absurd to believe.

243
00:17:22,605 --> 00:17:26,295
Did you think becoming someone
His Highness needs

244
00:17:26,295 --> 00:17:29,112
would be easy?

245
00:17:29,112 --> 00:17:32,066
It's not about whether
it's easy or difficult.

246
00:17:32,655 --> 00:17:37,750
I cannot bring myself to commit
an act that defies morality.

247
00:17:38,350 --> 00:17:39,950
Then.

248
00:17:41,057 --> 00:17:45,281
Are you content to live like this
for the rest of your days?

249
00:17:46,289 --> 00:17:49,720
Even if I were to leave this place
by such means

250
00:17:50,651 --> 00:17:56,370
would I truly be free?

251
00:17:59,098 --> 00:18:03,167
Because of his stubbornness,
he doomed not only his friends...

252
00:18:05,613 --> 00:18:08,912
but himself as well.

253
00:18:13,408 --> 00:18:16,676
How foolish can one be?

254
00:18:29,111 --> 00:18:31,779
Today, the wine tastes especially

255
00:18:31,779 --> 00:18:33,508
sweet.

256
00:18:43,681 --> 00:18:45,316
The rice isn't sticky at all!

257
00:18:45,316 --> 00:18:47,793
The kimchi is as salty as pure salt!

258
00:18:47,793 --> 00:18:50,447
And the doenjangguk is so scorched,
it's barely edible!

259
00:18:50,447 --> 00:18:52,697
This isn't a place for complaints.

260
00:18:52,697 --> 00:18:55,006
Eat what you're given, and stop whining.

261
00:18:55,006 --> 00:18:57,599
I can't put this filth in my mouth!

262
00:19:03,254 --> 00:19:05,805
I miss her cheonggukjang…

263
00:19:07,800 --> 00:19:12,191
Speaking of which,
I wonder how she's doing.

264
00:19:12,191 --> 00:19:14,942
I hope she regained consciousness.

265
00:19:16,650 --> 00:19:19,273
Madam! Wake up!

266
00:19:19,273 --> 00:19:21,867
Madam! Excuse me...

267
00:19:26,113 --> 00:19:27,586
You there.

268
00:19:27,586 --> 00:19:30,337
Can you call the officer who questioned me?

269
00:19:33,343 --> 00:19:34,601
Doctor!

270
00:19:34,601 --> 00:19:36,686
How's my mom...?

271
00:19:36,686 --> 00:19:38,854
We took all the necessary measures

272
00:19:38,854 --> 00:19:43,419
but due to severe intracerebral hemorrhage,
we can't guarantee anything.

273
00:19:44,015 --> 00:19:45,452
Are you...

274
00:19:45,452 --> 00:19:48,159
Are you saying she might not make it?

275
00:19:50,632 --> 00:19:52,215
Doctor...

276
00:19:52,215 --> 00:19:54,607
Please save my mom.

277
00:19:54,607 --> 00:19:59,022
The surgery went well,
so let's wait and see.

278
00:20:01,699 --> 00:20:04,998
She was fortunate to have been brought in
right after the accident.

279
00:20:04,998 --> 00:20:08,780
If she had arrived any later,
it might have been too late.

280
00:20:32,648 --> 00:20:36,557
Mom, I think someone's at the store.

281
00:20:42,929 --> 00:20:46,842
Mom, can you check outside?

282
00:20:52,329 --> 00:20:54,256
Where did she go?

283
00:20:58,291 --> 00:21:00,434
I'm coming! I'm coming!

284
00:21:00,434 --> 00:21:02,642
Who is it at this hour?

285
00:21:04,807 --> 00:21:06,407
Young lady!

286
00:21:07,651 --> 00:21:09,667
- Oh, seriously...
- Your mother is in danger!

287
00:21:09,667 --> 00:21:11,267
Hurry!

288
00:21:14,306 --> 00:21:17,053
Who on earth is that homeless guy?

289
00:21:17,904 --> 00:21:19,999
Is he a friend or foe?

290
00:21:22,057 --> 00:21:23,395
As far as I recall...

291
00:21:23,395 --> 00:21:26,785
The madam was with someone
right before the accident.

292
00:21:28,677 --> 00:21:31,445
You can't just make things up

293
00:21:31,445 --> 00:21:34,168
to get yourself out of this

294
00:21:34,168 --> 00:21:36,121
I'm not making it up!

295
00:21:37,637 --> 00:21:40,003
There was someone

296
00:21:41,357 --> 00:21:43,599
standing next to her.

297
00:21:43,599 --> 00:21:46,006
I never forget what I've seen.

298
00:21:46,006 --> 00:21:47,799
Are you sure?

299
00:21:48,823 --> 00:21:51,797
I stake my honor
as a Transcendent Genius on it.

300
00:21:51,797 --> 00:21:53,690
Did you see the person's face?

301
00:21:55,602 --> 00:21:57,641
No.

302
00:21:57,641 --> 00:22:01,257
It was raining, and the person
was holding a syurup.

303
00:22:02,390 --> 00:22:05,601
But I swear, she wasn't alone.

304
00:22:05,601 --> 00:22:07,632
Syurup? Kim Hye Soo...

305
00:22:07,632 --> 00:22:09,342
Oh, an umbrella?

306
00:22:11,328 --> 00:22:16,303
Was that person still there
when you found her?

307
00:22:20,188 --> 00:22:21,923
Help!

308
00:22:21,923 --> 00:22:23,803
Is no one around?!

309
00:22:23,803 --> 00:22:25,993
She's dying!

310
00:22:25,993 --> 00:22:27,624
Please, someone help!

311
00:22:27,624 --> 00:22:28,986
That's right.

312
00:22:28,986 --> 00:22:31,264
There was no one around then.

313
00:22:33,875 --> 00:22:35,953
I should check this out.

314
00:22:35,953 --> 00:22:37,721
Good idea!

315
00:22:38,323 --> 00:22:41,039
I'll take the lead.

316
00:22:41,039 --> 00:22:42,984
Why am I locked up again?

317
00:22:46,609 --> 00:22:48,380
How could you do this to me?!

318
00:22:53,365 --> 00:22:57,034
No wonder he looked so ominous in my dream.

319
00:22:59,996 --> 00:23:01,394
Apparently, this place is amazing.

320
00:23:01,394 --> 00:23:02,563
I'm starving.

321
00:23:02,563 --> 00:23:05,083
A place this cheap
and delicious is hard to find.

322
00:23:06,345 --> 00:23:07,735
I'm sorry.

323
00:23:07,735 --> 00:23:11,048
The diner is closed for now.
I apologize.

324
00:23:11,048 --> 00:23:12,133
We came all this way.

325
00:23:12,133 --> 00:23:15,045
Let's just come back another time.

326
00:23:25,619 --> 00:23:27,219
Eun Sil.

327
00:23:27,976 --> 00:23:30,160
Oh, Chef Lee?

328
00:23:31,955 --> 00:23:34,225
I heard the news.

329
00:23:34,225 --> 00:23:36,341
About your mother's injury...

330
00:23:38,310 --> 00:23:41,711
How is she?

331
00:23:42,638 --> 00:23:44,273
She's...

332
00:23:44,906 --> 00:23:46,940
She's unconscious.

333
00:23:52,717 --> 00:23:54,534
Have you eaten?

334
00:23:54,534 --> 00:23:57,268
You shouldn't skip meals.

335
00:23:59,474 --> 00:24:01,443
I don't feel like eating.

336
00:24:02,726 --> 00:24:06,673
At times like this, you need to stay strong.

337
00:24:07,411 --> 00:24:10,120
I'll cook something for you.

338
00:24:10,120 --> 00:24:11,835
Come with me.

339
00:24:16,518 --> 00:24:19,436
The family must stay strong
to take care of the patient

340
00:24:19,436 --> 00:24:21,483
and pay hospital expenses.

341
00:24:22,305 --> 00:24:24,266
Hospital expenses...

342
00:24:24,266 --> 00:24:28,385
Sorry, but I just remembered
I have something to take care of.

343
00:24:48,638 --> 00:24:52,013
Darn it, everyone of these is an overdraft account.

344
00:24:52,013 --> 00:24:54,945
What was Mom doing without
even getting general insurance?

345
00:24:55,553 --> 00:24:59,790
So nosy, yet far from substantial.

346
00:25:02,521 --> 00:25:04,414
Let's see.

347
00:25:04,414 --> 00:25:08,274
These two add up to 5.3 million won.

348
00:25:08,982 --> 00:25:11,293
This should be enough...

349
00:25:18,275 --> 00:25:21,039
Gyeong Won! It's me, Eun Sil.

350
00:25:21,039 --> 00:25:24,604
Eun Sil, is your mother okay?

351
00:25:26,605 --> 00:25:28,713
She's unconscious.

352
00:25:29,761 --> 00:25:35,109
Speaking of which,
can you lend me some money?

353
00:25:35,109 --> 00:25:37,349
My credit card's been overdue
for three months.

354
00:25:37,349 --> 00:25:39,078
Oh, really?

355
00:25:40,623 --> 00:25:43,480
Sang Eun, can I borrow some money?

356
00:25:43,480 --> 00:25:47,714
I maxed out my loans
preparing for my wedding.

357
00:25:47,714 --> 00:25:50,317
No, no, never mind. It's nothing urgent.

358
00:25:50,317 --> 00:25:53,514
Uncle, it's me, Eun Sil.

359
00:25:53,514 --> 00:25:55,036
What?

360
00:25:55,036 --> 00:25:56,652
Cancer?

361
00:25:58,109 --> 00:25:59,918
How did that happen...

362
00:26:05,930 --> 00:26:09,631
Didn't you say feeding people
at a low price was a virtue?

363
00:26:09,631 --> 00:26:12,718
You're in debt, Mom.

364
00:26:14,852 --> 00:26:16,681
This must be a dream.

365
00:26:18,111 --> 00:26:19,579
Wake up, Bong Eun Sil!

366
00:26:19,579 --> 00:26:23,347
Snap out of this nightmare already!

367
00:26:39,127 --> 00:26:41,389
I'm from Seonbuk Police Station.

368
00:26:41,389 --> 00:26:45,953
Can I check the surveillance footage
from outside your store?

369
00:27:04,242 --> 00:27:07,048
I need this for the investigation.

370
00:27:07,048 --> 00:27:09,651
Can I get a copy of this video?

371
00:27:17,601 --> 00:27:22,908
Closed due to personal matters.

372
00:27:22,908 --> 00:27:25,445
This must be the diner.

373
00:27:25,445 --> 00:27:27,045
Detective.

374
00:27:38,203 --> 00:27:40,070
Oh, thank you.

375
00:27:48,890 --> 00:27:51,216
You're here about my mom's case, right?

376
00:27:51,216 --> 00:27:52,389
Yes.

377
00:27:52,389 --> 00:27:53,976
Uh...

378
00:27:53,976 --> 00:27:56,966
I checked all the nearby surveillance cameras.

379
00:27:56,966 --> 00:28:01,228
But there was none at the accident site.

380
00:28:01,228 --> 00:28:04,460
However, we found footage
from a different street.

381
00:28:05,217 --> 00:28:06,979
Did you find anything?

382
00:28:08,194 --> 00:28:10,226
Well...

383
00:28:13,520 --> 00:28:15,125
Oh, chef! Are you okay?

384
00:28:15,125 --> 00:28:16,834
Oh, no! You're bleeding.

385
00:28:16,834 --> 00:28:18,459
What should we do?

386
00:28:18,459 --> 00:28:19,897
Oh, my.

387
00:28:19,897 --> 00:28:22,743
Stop fussing and get back to work.

388
00:28:22,743 --> 00:28:24,010
Sous chef, finish this up.

389
00:28:24,010 --> 00:28:25,610
Got it.

390
00:28:30,963 --> 00:28:33,057
Are you okay, sir?

391
00:28:34,471 --> 00:28:36,929
I'm fine It's just a small cut.

392
00:28:36,929 --> 00:28:39,638
Leave it here. I'll take care of it.

393
00:28:40,236 --> 00:28:41,986
Yes, sir.

394
00:28:47,186 --> 00:28:49,367
You must've come in early this morning.

395
00:28:51,692 --> 00:28:52,911
Excuse me?

396
00:28:52,911 --> 00:28:54,978
It wasn't raining when I came in

397
00:28:54,978 --> 00:28:57,121
but I heard it poured in the morning.

398
00:28:58,756 --> 00:29:01,922
Should I dry this outside?

399
00:29:03,331 --> 00:29:06,827
- No, throw it away.
- Pardon?

400
00:29:06,827 --> 00:29:08,976
It looks new.

401
00:29:10,659 --> 00:29:12,215
Toss it.

402
00:29:12,215 --> 00:29:13,890
Understood.

403
00:29:25,902 --> 00:29:27,970
There was nothing unusual.

404
00:29:27,970 --> 00:29:30,792
Your mother was alone the entire time.

405
00:29:30,792 --> 00:29:34,918
And the man who was with you
at the hospital earlier…

406
00:29:34,918 --> 00:29:36,568
Mr. Homeless?

407
00:29:36,568 --> 00:29:39,172
Yes, the footage shows him
heading toward the stairs

408
00:29:39,172 --> 00:29:41,991
after the accident.

409
00:29:41,991 --> 00:29:43,666
Oh, is that so?

410
00:29:43,666 --> 00:29:45,825
He was a friend, then.

411
00:29:45,825 --> 00:29:46,824
Pardon?

412
00:29:46,824 --> 00:29:48,866
Never mind.

413
00:29:50,047 --> 00:29:54,958
So, your mother's case
will be processed as an accident.

414
00:29:56,616 --> 00:29:58,714
But why was she there in the rain…

415
00:29:58,714 --> 00:30:00,981
Anyway, I'll take my leave now.

416
00:30:00,981 --> 00:30:02,581
Okay.

417
00:30:04,251 --> 00:30:09,767
By the way!
What will happen to Mr. Homeless?

418
00:30:12,475 --> 00:30:15,614
You locked up an innocent man
and didn't even apologize!

419
00:30:15,614 --> 00:30:18,990
I have something to say
to that grumpy officer!

420
00:30:27,583 --> 00:30:28,868
Let go of me!

421
00:30:28,868 --> 00:30:31,702
Wait! Let go of me!

422
00:30:32,672 --> 00:30:35,311
The team leader's out on duty.

423
00:30:35,311 --> 00:30:37,646
You made such a fuss to be freed,
so what now?

424
00:30:37,646 --> 00:30:39,379
Just leave already!

425
00:30:41,643 --> 00:30:43,599
Actually...

426
00:30:48,065 --> 00:30:50,336
I have nowhere to return to.

427
00:30:56,077 --> 00:30:59,707
Joseon fell, and in its place...
stands a nation of my descendants.

428
00:31:00,629 --> 00:31:03,206
I don't know

429
00:31:03,206 --> 00:31:05,918
how I got here

430
00:31:05,918 --> 00:31:07,866
or how to return.

431
00:31:18,044 --> 00:31:21,545
Ma'am, why can't we cross the road?

432
00:31:21,545 --> 00:31:23,172
Because the light is red.

433
00:31:23,172 --> 00:31:25,189
Why is it red?

434
00:31:25,189 --> 00:31:27,356
Because the green light went off.

435
00:31:27,356 --> 00:31:30,144
Why did the green light go off?

436
00:31:30,144 --> 00:31:32,744
Because it was time
for the red light to come on.

437
00:31:35,657 --> 00:31:38,855
Why are you wearing a hanbok?

438
00:31:38,855 --> 00:31:42,987
Why are your clothes so dirty?

439
00:31:42,987 --> 00:31:44,318
Don't you go to work?

440
00:31:44,318 --> 00:31:46,016
- Why?
- Why?

441
00:31:46,016 --> 00:31:48,191
Why?

442
00:31:48,191 --> 00:31:51,063
The pedestrian light is now green.

443
00:31:51,063 --> 00:31:53,544
You may cross.

444
00:31:55,034 --> 00:31:58,762
Okay, let's change the question.

445
00:31:58,762 --> 00:32:01,592
Not "how," but "why".

446
00:32:02,756 --> 00:32:05,361
Why did I end up in the land
of my descendants?

447
00:32:05,361 --> 00:32:07,770
There must be a reason.

448
00:32:09,601 --> 00:32:14,326
And maybe, just maybe...
That reason will lead me back to Joseon.

449
00:32:24,406 --> 00:32:28,341
[Ilsin Hospital]

450
00:32:37,322 --> 00:32:40,439
You actually let that lunatic go?

451
00:32:41,286 --> 00:32:43,414
Yes.

452
00:32:43,414 --> 00:32:45,546
He had no identification

453
00:32:45,546 --> 00:32:48,472
so it wasn't easy to release him.

454
00:32:48,472 --> 00:32:50,488
He said he saw me.

455
00:32:50,488 --> 00:32:52,678
How could you let him go?

456
00:32:54,282 --> 00:32:56,228
He only claimed

457
00:32:56,228 --> 00:33:00,492
to have seen someone, not you.

458
00:33:01,787 --> 00:33:03,463
This case will be closed as an accident

459
00:33:03,463 --> 00:33:08,395
so we can't have him claiming
he saw someone at the station.

460
00:33:11,298 --> 00:33:16,566
Still, I don't like
how I keep crossing paths with him.

461
00:33:17,629 --> 00:33:20,439
He didn't even seem sane.

462
00:33:20,439 --> 00:33:23,491
Wouldn't it be better to put him in a hospital?

463
00:33:24,155 --> 00:33:27,274
Why are you so uneasy?

464
00:33:28,841 --> 00:33:30,574
This case.

465
00:33:31,753 --> 00:33:35,317
It was just an accident, right?

466
00:33:37,689 --> 00:33:41,468
Chef Lee, I'll get going now.

467
00:33:50,739 --> 00:33:52,375
Madam.

468
00:33:54,370 --> 00:33:55,960
It was an accident.

469
00:33:55,960 --> 00:33:57,563
Right?

470
00:34:00,341 --> 00:34:01,663
Even if it was...

471
00:34:01,663 --> 00:34:05,502
just being there with her
is enough to start rumors.

472
00:34:05,502 --> 00:34:09,997
And rumors alone
can ruin someone like me.

473
00:34:10,608 --> 00:34:13,219
That's why I'm here

474
00:34:13,219 --> 00:34:15,576
to deal with troublesome matters.

475
00:34:16,539 --> 00:34:18,084
The surveillance footage is gone.

476
00:34:18,084 --> 00:34:20,080
And the case will be closed soon.

477
00:34:20,080 --> 00:34:25,148
So don't worry,
just focus on your business.

478
00:34:25,148 --> 00:34:28,862
You're already running behind schedule.

479
00:34:29,780 --> 00:34:32,721
I'll handle my business my way.

480
00:34:33,872 --> 00:34:35,814
Come on, don't be like that.

481
00:34:36,454 --> 00:34:39,834
Even if it's a small stake,
I am part of this business.

482
00:34:39,834 --> 00:34:42,649
Don't I have the right to an opinion?

483
00:34:45,386 --> 00:34:48,896
Well, I guess that puts us in the same boat.

484
00:34:55,835 --> 00:34:57,435
Please get out.

485
00:34:58,035 --> 00:34:59,281
Huh?

486
00:34:59,281 --> 00:35:02,961
I need to go and resolve
the delayed business.

487
00:35:03,614 --> 00:35:05,479
So get out.

488
00:35:22,986 --> 00:35:25,629
I thought he was just some cook

489
00:35:25,629 --> 00:35:27,569
but he's got some bite.

490
00:35:41,552 --> 00:35:45,141
Are you dissatisfied with the offer?

491
00:35:45,141 --> 00:35:48,337
No, it's far too much.

492
00:35:48,960 --> 00:35:52,528
Are you sure this is the correct sum?

493
00:35:52,528 --> 00:35:56,652
Yes, it's the amount your mother agreed to.

494
00:35:56,652 --> 00:35:59,309
All that was left was her signature

495
00:36:00,335 --> 00:36:02,332
but then the accident occurred.

496
00:36:03,909 --> 00:36:06,469
It's truly regrettable.

497
00:36:06,469 --> 00:36:10,783
Did Mom really agree to sell this place?

498
00:36:12,340 --> 00:36:14,227
That's strange.

499
00:36:15,206 --> 00:36:18,324
She always said
she'd run this place till she drops.

500
00:36:19,337 --> 00:36:20,694
Was she just bluffing?

501
00:36:20,694 --> 00:36:23,656
Well, she could've changed her mind.

502
00:36:23,656 --> 00:36:27,417
Working at a restaurant is demanding.

503
00:36:28,380 --> 00:36:29,980
That's true.

504
00:36:30,602 --> 00:36:32,211
Eun Sil.

505
00:36:32,990 --> 00:36:38,591
Can you run this restaurant alone
without your mother?

506
00:36:38,591 --> 00:36:40,191
No.

507
00:36:40,951 --> 00:36:43,529
I'm a terrible cook.

508
00:36:43,529 --> 00:36:45,174
No skills at all.

509
00:36:47,514 --> 00:36:51,678
Even instant noodles taste bitter
when I cook them.

510
00:36:52,926 --> 00:36:55,162
Then, why are you hesitating?

511
00:36:55,162 --> 00:36:59,919
But selling it with my own hands feels...

512
00:37:00,627 --> 00:37:03,613
My attorney will handle the paperwork.

513
00:37:03,613 --> 00:37:06,349
You can sign on behalf

514
00:37:06,349 --> 00:37:10,514
of your unconscious mother.

515
00:37:10,514 --> 00:37:12,561
That's not what I meant.

516
00:37:13,764 --> 00:37:16,159
Let's sign the contract after she wakes up.

517
00:37:16,159 --> 00:37:18,121
That's the right way to do this.

518
00:37:18,121 --> 00:37:19,882
Then...

519
00:37:20,994 --> 00:37:22,914
What about the hospital expenses?

520
00:37:25,075 --> 00:37:27,215
Eun Sil.

521
00:37:27,215 --> 00:37:30,314
Aren't you in desperate need of money?

522
00:37:32,026 --> 00:37:33,984
I really do need the money.

523
00:37:34,980 --> 00:37:38,272
When matters are pressing,
and you have no other family members

524
00:37:38,272 --> 00:37:40,583
the legal procedures can be
processed much faster.

525
00:37:40,583 --> 00:37:42,277
So...

526
00:37:45,079 --> 00:37:48,764
All you need to do is sign it, Eun Sil.

527
00:37:49,831 --> 00:37:52,001
And leave...

528
00:37:52,001 --> 00:37:53,869
the rest to me.

529
00:37:56,040 --> 00:37:59,824
I'm just signing what my mom
already agreed to, right?

530
00:38:00,442 --> 00:38:02,569
Yes, that's right.

531
00:38:11,673 --> 00:38:13,356
I can't do it.

532
00:38:15,513 --> 00:38:17,787
What's the matter?

533
00:38:17,787 --> 00:38:22,452
Eun Sil, you said
you were sick of this place.

534
00:38:22,452 --> 00:38:24,272
I did.

535
00:38:25,276 --> 00:38:28,883
It was my goal to break away
from this diner.

536
00:38:28,883 --> 00:38:31,637
Then, what's the problem?

537
00:38:31,637 --> 00:38:33,469
I don't know.

538
00:38:35,191 --> 00:38:38,064
My mom has been working here
for all her life.

539
00:38:40,819 --> 00:38:44,715
She always said
she'd run this place till the end.

540
00:38:46,763 --> 00:38:49,583
If I sell it, she'll have
nowhere to return to.

541
00:38:50,784 --> 00:38:53,205
And if she has nowhere to return to...

542
00:38:53,205 --> 00:38:56,313
She might never wake up.

543
00:38:56,313 --> 00:38:58,913
Wait, what kind of stupid...

544
00:39:13,238 --> 00:39:17,030
I guess this isn't the right time.

545
00:39:17,030 --> 00:39:20,534
You must be troubled enough
with your mother's accident.

546
00:39:21,144 --> 00:39:24,116
You should take a few more days
to bring yourself together.

547
00:39:24,116 --> 00:39:26,352
And let's talk again then.

548
00:39:27,309 --> 00:39:28,909
Okay.

549
00:39:30,207 --> 00:39:32,364
I'm sorry.

550
00:39:34,017 --> 00:39:36,531
Wake up, Bong Eun Sil.

551
00:39:37,449 --> 00:39:39,631
If you don't sell this

552
00:39:39,631 --> 00:39:42,879
do you plan to cook meals
instead of Mom or something?

553
00:39:54,943 --> 00:39:56,976
Why not?

554
00:39:56,976 --> 00:39:59,873
It's just that I never tried.
But if I do, cooking?

555
00:39:59,873 --> 00:40:02,865
It's just grilling and stir-frying, right?

556
00:40:11,245 --> 00:40:13,807
I wonder if the madam
has regained consciousness.

557
00:40:15,032 --> 00:40:19,109
I owe her a favor.
A visit is the least I can do.

558
00:40:21,568 --> 00:40:23,523
Honey!

559
00:40:23,523 --> 00:40:26,615
- Honey! Wake up, honey!
- Can I ask you something?

560
00:40:26,615 --> 00:40:28,799
- I'm looking for the madam who runs a diner...
- Excuse me.

561
00:40:28,799 --> 00:40:31,023
Patient incoming!

562
00:40:31,819 --> 00:40:33,406
Are you a patient?

563
00:40:33,406 --> 00:40:35,221
Where are you injured?

564
00:40:39,937 --> 00:40:41,902
I'm not injured.

565
00:40:41,902 --> 00:40:43,977
How many fingers?

566
00:40:43,977 --> 00:40:45,940
Three?

567
00:40:45,940 --> 00:40:47,595
What's the date today?

568
00:40:47,595 --> 00:40:49,358
Today is...

569
00:40:49,358 --> 00:40:51,457
That's what I want to know.

570
00:40:51,457 --> 00:40:54,227
Tell me, what year, month, and day is it?

571
00:40:55,299 --> 00:40:58,432
Emergency over here!
Get a CT scan of his brain first!

572
00:40:58,432 --> 00:41:00,969
Take off your shoes and lie down.

573
00:41:04,058 --> 00:41:06,080
Lie down please.

574
00:41:06,883 --> 00:41:08,526
Wait!

575
00:41:09,670 --> 00:41:13,278
Where are you taking me?

576
00:41:13,278 --> 00:41:15,815
You're not going anywhere, just lie down.

577
00:41:15,815 --> 00:41:18,711
Hold your breath and stay put.

578
00:41:18,711 --> 00:41:21,484
Hold my breath?

579
00:41:25,291 --> 00:41:27,375
You said it's not taking me anywhere!

580
00:41:27,375 --> 00:41:28,945
Where is it taking me?

581
00:41:28,945 --> 00:41:30,158
I...

582
00:41:30,158 --> 00:41:33,048
I'm here to look for the madam!

583
00:41:37,899 --> 00:41:42,195
Why does no one listen in this place?!

584
00:41:42,195 --> 00:41:43,795
Sir!

585
00:41:48,422 --> 00:41:50,244
Sir!

586
00:41:54,605 --> 00:41:58,161
Chop the cleaned vegetables
into large pieces.

587
00:41:59,874 --> 00:42:01,867
Why won't these chop properly?

588
00:42:04,702 --> 00:42:05,772
Ow! That's hot!

589
00:42:05,772 --> 00:42:07,943
Remove the kelp once it starts to boil.

590
00:42:07,943 --> 00:42:09,581
Ow! It's hot!

591
00:42:15,880 --> 00:42:17,980
Why can't I hold it?

592
00:42:18,949 --> 00:42:22,611
Wait, why aren't they telling me
how to remove the kelp?

593
00:42:22,611 --> 00:42:25,104
Now, stir-fry the vegetables.

594
00:42:32,458 --> 00:42:35,927
Of course, you know you need to remove
the moisture before stir-frying, right?

595
00:42:35,927 --> 00:42:38,509
Why are you telling me this now?

596
00:42:41,864 --> 00:42:43,485
Hello?

597
00:42:44,693 --> 00:42:46,441
Who is it?

598
00:42:53,122 --> 00:42:55,198
Did something happen to my mom?

599
00:42:55,198 --> 00:42:56,825
Well...

600
00:43:00,279 --> 00:43:02,426
Young lady!

601
00:43:02,426 --> 00:43:06,535
We told him he couldn't visit,
but he entered the ICU...

602
00:43:08,417 --> 00:43:11,853
I only wanted to see how she was.

603
00:43:19,923 --> 00:43:22,192
Why are you in a patient's gown?

604
00:43:22,960 --> 00:43:24,895
Are you injured?

605
00:43:27,512 --> 00:43:29,564
It's a long story.

606
00:43:29,564 --> 00:43:33,127
I'm not injured.
I came here to visit your mother.

607
00:43:34,591 --> 00:43:37,604
The madam is yet to wake up.

608
00:43:38,535 --> 00:43:40,849
You must be worried.

609
00:43:40,849 --> 00:43:42,783
The doctor said

610
00:43:42,783 --> 00:43:47,838
that if it weren't for you, my mom
wouldn't have been able to have surgery.

611
00:43:50,137 --> 00:43:53,261
I'm sorry for doubting you earlier.

612
00:43:54,813 --> 00:43:57,226
Wasn't it rough at the police station?

613
00:43:57,226 --> 00:43:59,732
Don't even get me started.

614
00:43:59,732 --> 00:44:01,716
They locked up an innocent man.

615
00:44:01,716 --> 00:44:03,737
The food was so awful.

616
00:44:03,737 --> 00:44:06,288
I couldn't even eat it.

617
00:44:06,288 --> 00:44:10,097
Then, have you been starving all along?

618
00:44:15,981 --> 00:44:19,436
Want me to make you something?

619
00:44:33,992 --> 00:44:37,782
Why does it sound like
you're having a war in the kitchen?

620
00:44:40,465 --> 00:44:42,144
Ta-da!

621
00:44:44,992 --> 00:44:46,595
I made it.

622
00:44:57,253 --> 00:45:01,777
But why are you being so nice to me
all of a sudden?

623
00:45:01,777 --> 00:45:04,417
You didn't even let me set foot
into the restaurant.

624
00:45:05,008 --> 00:45:07,855
I mean, you helped my mom.

625
00:45:07,855 --> 00:45:10,823
I feel grateful and bad for this and that.

626
00:45:10,823 --> 00:45:12,945
And I needed a guinea pig.

627
00:45:13,883 --> 00:45:16,064
What did you say?

628
00:45:16,064 --> 00:45:17,946
No, nothing.

629
00:45:17,946 --> 00:45:19,769
Hurry and try it.

630
00:45:20,664 --> 00:45:22,855
Then, I'll enjoy the meal.

631
00:45:41,239 --> 00:45:43,279
You did that on purpose, didn't you?

632
00:45:44,735 --> 00:45:46,938
No, that was unintentional.

633
00:45:47,772 --> 00:45:51,490
The rice was so smoky,
I thought I was chewing on gunpowder.

634
00:45:51,490 --> 00:45:53,281
Why?

635
00:45:53,996 --> 00:45:56,059
Did I add too much pepper?

636
00:46:06,582 --> 00:46:08,721
I can't suffer alone.

637
00:46:09,841 --> 00:46:12,078
What on earth did you do to the rice?

638
00:46:12,078 --> 00:46:15,564
I need to see what went wrong.
Do it again.

639
00:46:15,564 --> 00:46:19,018
All I did was stir-fry kimchi and scallions

640
00:46:19,018 --> 00:46:21,356
then toss in some meat, rice, and seasoning.

641
00:46:21,356 --> 00:46:25,211
How did you turn such great ingredients
into a culinary disaster?

642
00:46:26,302 --> 00:46:29,251
It's a talent the Minister of Defense would desire.

643
00:46:32,008 --> 00:46:33,810
Look at that!

644
00:46:35,101 --> 00:46:37,150
You don't even know the basics of chopping!

645
00:46:37,150 --> 00:46:40,511
If you mash the scallions like that,
they lose their texture and just taste spicy.

646
00:46:40,511 --> 00:46:44,409
Why don't you come
and try it yourself, know-it-all?

647
00:46:45,994 --> 00:46:48,248
That's impossible.

648
00:46:48,248 --> 00:46:50,039
I'm an honorable man,
so I can't enter the kitchen.

649
00:46:50,039 --> 00:46:51,412
There you go again!

650
00:46:51,412 --> 00:46:53,492
Stop talking like such a fuddy-duddy!

651
00:46:54,623 --> 00:46:56,428
A fuddy-duddy?

652
00:46:57,212 --> 00:46:58,902
That clearly sounds offensive.

653
00:46:58,902 --> 00:47:03,542
People who are stuck-up
and outdated like you are called boomers!

654
00:47:03,542 --> 00:47:06,578
And you're the worst fuddy-duddy!

655
00:47:07,326 --> 00:47:10,524
That's the most insulting thing
I've ever heard!

656
00:47:13,295 --> 00:47:17,037
I was said to be liberal
and ahead of my time!

657
00:47:17,810 --> 00:47:21,317
Ahead of your time?
You can't even step into a kitchen!

658
00:47:22,144 --> 00:47:24,966
Hey, don't tell me
you actually believe something falls off

659
00:47:24,966 --> 00:47:27,595
if a man enters the kitchen.

660
00:47:27,595 --> 00:47:29,691
Something falls...

661
00:47:32,790 --> 00:47:35,506
How crude and shameless!

662
00:47:35,506 --> 00:47:38,334
All this time, you're scared to come in.

663
00:47:39,894 --> 00:47:41,537
Is that correct?

664
00:47:41,537 --> 00:47:43,407
What are you doing?!

665
00:47:43,407 --> 00:47:44,748
It's because...

666
00:47:44,748 --> 00:47:46,840
I'm crude and shameless!

667
00:47:46,840 --> 00:47:48,629
Stop!

668
00:47:48,629 --> 00:47:50,498
What if I don't?

669
00:47:50,498 --> 00:47:52,938
Are you going to come inside
to chase after me?

670
00:48:20,468 --> 00:48:22,857
You must be stunned

671
00:48:22,857 --> 00:48:26,606
by my bold and non-fuddy-duddy steps!

672
00:48:28,069 --> 00:48:29,669
Wait.

673
00:48:43,446 --> 00:48:45,046
Get out.

674
00:48:46,112 --> 00:48:47,173
Excuse me?

675
00:48:47,173 --> 00:48:49,995
I said get out of the kitchen.

676
00:48:49,995 --> 00:48:53,124
I'll show you what real food tastes like.

677
00:48:58,252 --> 00:49:02,962
The taste, aroma, and warmth
of the food I remember.

678
00:49:03,600 --> 00:49:06,662
I will serve all of them in a single bowl.

679
00:49:38,635 --> 00:49:42,664
Well, you made something pretty close.

680
00:49:42,664 --> 00:49:47,012
But then, cooking isn't just about theory.

681
00:49:47,600 --> 00:49:51,628
I'll judge you fairly, considering
it's your first time in the kitchen.

682
00:50:13,719 --> 00:50:15,604
Why did you stop eating?

683
00:50:17,325 --> 00:50:19,044
Does it taste bad?

684
00:50:24,946 --> 00:50:26,814
Tastes fine to me.

685
00:50:30,614 --> 00:50:32,528
It's the same.

686
00:50:34,998 --> 00:50:37,827
It tastes just like Mom's gukbap.

687
00:50:41,902 --> 00:50:45,276
I can't eat it because it reminds me of her.

688
00:50:47,486 --> 00:50:49,031
That's because...

689
00:50:49,031 --> 00:50:51,041
I, a Transcendent Genius, never forget the flavors

690
00:50:51,041 --> 00:50:53,008
I've had before.

691
00:50:53,008 --> 00:50:55,288
So, I figured out the recipe in reverse...

692
00:50:55,932 --> 00:50:58,025
Mr. Homeless, shut up.

693
00:50:58,835 --> 00:51:01,103
What a mood-killer.

694
00:51:03,459 --> 00:51:05,287
Let's do this.

695
00:51:07,971 --> 00:51:10,368
Do what?

696
00:51:13,016 --> 00:51:17,118
Let's run this diner together.
