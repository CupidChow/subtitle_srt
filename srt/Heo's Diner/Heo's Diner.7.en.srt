11
00:00:32,609 --> 00:00:34,477
Let's work together.

12
00:00:34,477 --> 00:00:37,273
I'll give you the best possible offer.

13
00:00:50,841 --> 00:00:56,937
As you said, the diner looks humble,
with barely any customers.

14
00:00:56,937 --> 00:01:01,270
But still, I am the one
in charge of the kitchen at that diner.

15
00:01:01,983 --> 00:01:05,401
This place will be fine without me.

16
00:01:05,401 --> 00:01:10,079
But the diner wouldn't even be open
if I'm not there.

17
00:01:13,038 --> 00:01:18,230
Lady Eun Sil, you see,
has a knack for making inedible food.

18
00:01:22,077 --> 00:01:25,524
You must care about her a lot.

19
00:01:26,667 --> 00:01:30,638
She may put on a tough front

20
00:01:30,638 --> 00:01:32,530
but deep down, she's quite delicate.

21
00:01:33,236 --> 00:01:38,167
That's precisely why I'm saying this.

22
00:01:38,963 --> 00:01:41,058
Right now, she must be feeling

23
00:01:41,058 --> 00:01:43,641
incredibly anxious about money.

24
00:01:43,641 --> 00:01:49,567
From what I know, she can barely cover
her mother's hospital bills.

25
00:01:49,567 --> 00:01:51,373
Indeed.

26
00:01:52,975 --> 00:01:56,341
Money is all she can think about these days.

27
00:01:58,032 --> 00:02:00,358
If I accept your offer

28
00:02:00,358 --> 00:02:03,750
will you provide enough to cover
the hospital expenses?

29
00:02:03,750 --> 00:02:08,488
Of course, haven't I promised you
the best possible offer?

30
00:02:38,588 --> 00:02:43,267
It's an offer I never once considered,
so I can't help but feel conflicted.

31
00:02:46,402 --> 00:02:49,414
Then start considering it now.

32
00:02:49,414 --> 00:02:51,157
Have a seat.

33
00:02:57,003 --> 00:03:00,634
By the way, what should I call you?

34
00:03:00,634 --> 00:03:03,349
Please call me Gyosan.

35
00:03:03,349 --> 00:03:06,928
That's what Gwansong used to call me.

36
00:03:06,928 --> 00:03:10,082
The one you said I resemble?

37
00:03:10,082 --> 00:03:11,609
Yes.

38
00:03:11,609 --> 00:03:17,681
Strangely enough, this moment feels like
something I've seen before.

39
00:03:18,690 --> 00:03:22,782
Gwansong once made me
a special offer as well.

40
00:03:23,450 --> 00:03:27,094
That was the last time I saw him.

41
00:03:27,094 --> 00:03:29,110
What was he like?

42
00:03:29,110 --> 00:03:31,536
The man who resembles me.

43
00:03:33,070 --> 00:03:37,823
He was entirely devoted to his work

44
00:03:37,823 --> 00:03:41,289
a man completely different
from a wanderer like me.

45
00:03:42,080 --> 00:03:44,682
Yet, despite our differences,
he always looked out for me

46
00:03:44,682 --> 00:03:47,221
I'll always be grateful for that.

47
00:03:48,556 --> 00:03:50,354
That's intriguing.

48
00:03:51,244 --> 00:03:54,115
I'd like to hear more.

49
00:03:55,219 --> 00:03:57,504
There's still some drink left

50
00:03:57,504 --> 00:03:59,774
so why not stay for a few more?

51
00:03:59,774 --> 00:04:02,474
The night is long, after all.

52
00:04:48,198 --> 00:04:51,130
What a pitiful display.

53
00:04:51,889 --> 00:04:55,053
Confess now, and this will all end swiftly.

54
00:04:55,053 --> 00:05:01,542
How can we confess to a crime
we never committed?

55
00:05:03,426 --> 00:05:07,608
You conspired treason against the throne.

56
00:05:09,146 --> 00:05:11,145
Plotted to slay the king

57
00:05:11,772 --> 00:05:14,465
and sought to enthrone Prince Yeongchang.

58
00:05:14,465 --> 00:05:16,974
Treason?

59
00:05:16,974 --> 00:05:19,808
That's absurd.

60
00:05:19,808 --> 00:05:22,573
We are mere illegitimate sons.

61
00:05:22,573 --> 00:05:25,383
You, of all people, should know

62
00:05:25,383 --> 00:05:29,723
we are utterly powerless
to attempt such a thing.

63
00:05:32,290 --> 00:05:36,735
Denying it won't make the crime vanish.

64
00:05:39,383 --> 00:05:42,288
You are only prolonging your agony.

65
00:05:47,535 --> 00:05:50,209
You're far more foolish than I thought.

66
00:05:58,096 --> 00:06:00,692
Your Excellency!

67
00:06:01,741 --> 00:06:04,135
Please summon Gyosan.

68
00:06:04,135 --> 00:06:10,898
He will prove our innocence!

69
00:06:10,898 --> 00:06:13,515
I would like to grant your request…

70
00:06:13,515 --> 00:06:15,168
But unfortunately.

71
00:06:16,342 --> 00:06:19,675
I have no means to summon the dead.

72
00:06:20,453 --> 00:06:26,256
Gyosan is dead?

73
00:06:27,372 --> 00:06:30,040
How… Why?!

74
00:06:30,792 --> 00:06:32,599
Unbelievable.

75
00:06:33,838 --> 00:06:39,450
Even now, you choose to worry about others?

76
00:07:09,595 --> 00:07:14,220
Tonight, the moon's radiance is at its peak

77
00:07:14,220 --> 00:07:17,777
I drink, reluctant to let
the sight go to waste.

78
00:07:17,777 --> 00:07:20,842
The wanderer's heart grows wistful.

79
00:07:21,503 --> 00:07:25,881
Ancient souls must have gazed upon
this same moon.

80
00:07:26,506 --> 00:07:30,835
Yet, who among them still remains?

81
00:07:36,631 --> 00:07:39,498
That's a truly beautiful poem.

82
00:07:39,498 --> 00:07:42,951
And it fits the mood of tonight perfectly.

83
00:07:42,951 --> 00:07:45,371
It feels a little embarrassing
to say this myself

84
00:07:45,371 --> 00:07:46,785
but when it comes to literary talent

85
00:07:46,785 --> 00:07:50,198
this Transcendent Genius
stands second to none.

86
00:07:50,802 --> 00:07:54,474
You truly are a man of many talents.

87
00:07:54,474 --> 00:07:59,399
The more I learn about you,
the more I want us to work together.

88
00:08:01,241 --> 00:08:03,297
My goodness...

89
00:08:04,334 --> 00:08:07,831
The less time you spend hesitating, the better.

90
00:08:07,831 --> 00:08:11,848
Especially if you consider Eun Sil

91
00:08:12,867 --> 00:08:16,205
who's struggling to make
ends meet as we speak.

92
00:08:16,925 --> 00:08:18,620
I...

93
00:08:30,123 --> 00:08:31,969
Sorry, it's my alarm.

94

95
00:08:35,558 --> 00:08:37,385
Alarm?

96
00:08:38,550 --> 00:08:41,520
It's music that wakes you up.

97
00:08:41,520 --> 00:08:47,033
I wake up to this music every day at 4 AM.

98
00:08:47,714 --> 00:08:51,620
Wait, so dawn has already broken?

99
00:08:52,723 --> 00:08:56,755
Yes, we stayed up all night.

100
00:08:56,755 --> 00:08:59,818
I didn't even notice the time passing.

101
00:08:59,818 --> 00:09:02,185
I better get going now.

102
00:09:03,595 --> 00:09:05,565
As for your offer,

103
00:09:05,565 --> 00:09:09,102
I will give it careful thought and decide soon.

104
00:09:10,642 --> 00:09:15,398
Good, I will be waiting for good news.

105
00:09:20,635 --> 00:09:22,555
Oh, and…

106
00:09:22,555 --> 00:09:27,930
About that music called "alarm".

107
00:09:28,800 --> 00:09:31,650
It feels strangely familiar.

108
00:09:34,966 --> 00:09:36,440
Never mind.

109
00:09:36,440 --> 00:09:41,400
If I had heard it before, there's no way
a Transcendent Genius like me would forget.

110
00:09:42,294 --> 00:09:45,737
It must be the drinks confusing me.

111
00:09:46,875 --> 00:09:48,771
Then, I'll take my leave.

112
00:10:14,669 --> 00:10:16,549
Mr. Homeless?

113
00:10:18,242 --> 00:10:20,631
What took you so long to get back?

114
00:10:21,855 --> 00:10:25,594
Why aren't you resting upstairs?

115
00:10:25,594 --> 00:10:30,562
How could I possibly sleep
when you left without a word?

116
00:10:33,561 --> 00:10:35,128
Wait.

117
00:10:35,128 --> 00:10:37,029
You stayed out all night.

118
00:10:37,029 --> 00:10:40,231
Where have you been?

119
00:10:40,231 --> 00:10:41,863
Let's work together.

120
00:10:41,863 --> 00:10:44,381
I'll give you the best possible offer.

121
00:10:44,381 --> 00:10:47,480
I was meeting a friend.

122
00:10:47,480 --> 00:10:49,378
A friend?

123
00:10:49,378 --> 00:10:53,540
You came from the past, with no home or ties,
and now you have a friend?

124
00:10:53,540 --> 00:10:55,140
Oh.

125
00:11:00,834 --> 00:11:04,868
- Hang on! You even had drinks.
- Enough!

126
00:11:04,868 --> 00:11:09,066
You can't condemn a man
for enjoying drinks with a friend.

127
00:11:09,066 --> 00:11:10,666
Must you pry so much?

128
00:11:10,666 --> 00:11:13,487
So you waltzed out in the middle of work

129
00:11:13,487 --> 00:11:16,485
while I was left painting
and setting up all alone

130
00:11:16,485 --> 00:11:19,748
and now you stroll in the next day,
acting all high and mighty?

131
00:11:23,363 --> 00:11:26,436
Well, you're the one who started it

132
00:11:26,436 --> 00:11:29,790
so it's only right you finish it.

133
00:11:29,790 --> 00:11:31,715
Excuse me?

134
00:11:33,651 --> 00:11:35,455
I'm exhausted.

135
00:11:37,450 --> 00:11:40,119
I should rest my eyes even for a bit.

136
00:11:53,094 --> 00:11:57,324
Perhaps among all places in the future,
there is a reason I ended up here.

137
00:11:57,324 --> 00:12:02,754
And that reason is most likely tied to Gwansong.

138
00:12:02,754 --> 00:12:05,515
Otherwise...

139
00:12:05,515 --> 00:12:11,222
Are you content to stay in that shabby diner
for the rest of your days?

140
00:12:11,222 --> 00:12:14,797
Are you content to live like this
for the rest of your days?

141
00:12:15,411 --> 00:12:21,280
Could it really be a mere coincidence
that someone so much like him exists here?

142
00:12:21,280 --> 00:12:26,031
If I work with him,
perhaps I'll find the answer.

143
00:12:27,508 --> 00:12:34,226
And in doing so, I may uncover
why I ended up here...

144
00:12:34,226 --> 00:12:36,637
and how I can return.

145
00:12:38,225 --> 00:12:43,676
One thing is certain, I'll gain far more
than I would by staying at the diner.

146
00:12:43,676 --> 00:12:45,294
Gain what?

147
00:12:49,498 --> 00:12:52,560
Gain what more than staying at the diner?

148
00:12:54,934 --> 00:12:56,769
I heard everything!

149
00:12:56,769 --> 00:12:59,861
Don't talk to someone who's asleep.

150
00:12:59,861 --> 00:13:03,879
Who talks back in their sleep?

151
00:13:04,505 --> 00:13:08,215
I'm talking in my sleep, that's all.

152
00:13:20,294 --> 00:13:23,079

Mister!

156
00:13:54,386 --> 00:13:55,781
What did you say?

157
00:13:55,781 --> 00:13:58,808
I asked if you noticed any changes!

158
00:14:02,142 --> 00:14:06,498
The walls are cleaner,
and so are the tables.

159
00:14:07,930 --> 00:14:09,487
What else?

160
00:14:10,986 --> 00:14:13,057
What else is there?

161
00:14:13,888 --> 00:14:16,348
Take a close look.

163
00:14:20,355 --> 00:14:22,968
- Mister!
- Yes, yes?

164
00:14:22,968 --> 00:14:25,829
Why are you so distracted?

165
00:14:27,718 --> 00:14:30,032
Did you ask me if I noticed something?

166
00:14:34,664 --> 00:14:38,085
Forget it, let's get ready to open.

167
00:15:08,533 --> 00:15:11,702
I thought today would be busy…

168
00:15:11,702 --> 00:15:15,183
We caught the culprit, cleared our name

169
00:15:16,064 --> 00:15:18,924
and even gave the place a full makeover.

170
00:15:20,667 --> 00:15:25,372
I did everything I could,
so why aren't there any customers?

171
00:16:11,376 --> 00:16:15,002
Young lady, sit down for a moment.

172
00:16:23,770 --> 00:16:25,597
Business is still slow

173
00:16:25,597 --> 00:16:28,783
so instead of the both of us waiting
for customers who never come…

174
00:16:28,783 --> 00:16:32,924
Wouldn't it be better if at least one of us
goes out and earns some money?

175

You said you were desperate for money.

176
00:16:35,724 --> 00:16:40,510
I was already thinking of picking up
a night shift somewhere.

177
00:16:40,510 --> 00:16:43,104
Though it won't be much.

178
00:16:43,104 --> 00:16:48,345
Instead of that, how about I work
at another restaurant?

179
00:16:48,345 --> 00:16:50,404
What do you mean?

180
00:16:53,535 --> 00:16:58,065
Are you saying you're quitting?

181
00:17:00,925 --> 00:17:04,477
Is this related to your overnight trip?

182
00:17:04,477 --> 00:17:07,967
That's why you've been acting so weird!

183
00:17:07,967 --> 00:17:11,606
I knew something was off!

184
00:17:12,969 --> 00:17:16,502
I was offered a good deal last night.

185
00:17:17,094 --> 00:17:21,707
If I go work for them,
they'll pay enough to cover all my concerns.

186
00:17:21,707 --> 00:17:23,179
So,

187
00:17:23,984 --> 00:17:26,220
what's your thought?

188
00:17:27,265 --> 00:17:29,385
Do you want to go?

189
00:17:30,211 --> 00:17:32,886
- There aren't any customers…
- Don't use that as an excuse

190
00:17:32,886 --> 00:17:35,672
I'm asking what you want.

191
00:17:39,308 --> 00:17:41,451
I want to work there.

192
00:17:42,236 --> 00:17:46,314
I feel like the answers
I'm searching for are there.

193
00:17:46,985 --> 00:17:49,033
Where would that be?

194
00:17:50,497 --> 00:17:53,510
Who's offering you so much?

195
00:17:55,176 --> 00:17:57,302
Actually...

196
00:17:58,283 --> 00:18:01,108
The one who made me that offer last night…

197
00:18:01,782 --> 00:18:04,384
Ah, I'm starving.

198
00:18:05,086 --> 00:18:06,663
So hungry I'm getting dizzy.

199
00:18:06,663 --> 00:18:09,753
You did say I could come anytime, right?

200
00:18:12,757 --> 00:18:18,244
Then why does it always feel so tense here?

201
00:18:19,178 --> 00:18:20,595
Mi Sol, you're here.

202
00:18:20,595 --> 00:18:23,087
Yeah, I'm here.

203
00:18:23,087 --> 00:18:25,449
But I feel like I shouldn't be.

204
00:18:25,449 --> 00:18:27,894
That's not true. Take a seat.

205
00:18:33,176 --> 00:18:34,939
What's going on?

206
00:18:34,939 --> 00:18:36,636
Did you two fight again?

207
00:18:38,959 --> 00:18:40,933
Are you eating well, Mae Chang?

208
00:18:40,933 --> 00:18:44,928
If I were, I wouldn't be here.

209
00:18:44,928 --> 00:18:49,258
I tried eating again after your porridge…

210
00:18:49,258 --> 00:18:51,561
Wait, that's Jung Mi Sol, right?

211
00:18:51,561 --> 00:18:53,960
I heard she binge-vomits.

212
00:18:53,960 --> 00:18:55,638
Is she here to eat?

213
00:19:07,789 --> 00:19:09,726
Guess the rumors were true.

214
00:19:12,234 --> 00:19:14,750
I failed every time.

215
00:19:14,750 --> 00:19:18,849
But what's worse is the people
who film and upload videos of me.

216
00:19:19,557 --> 00:19:22,937
They get off on other people's misery.

217
00:19:22,937 --> 00:19:25,695
My faith in humanity is at an all-time low.

218
00:19:27,547 --> 00:19:29,525
What do you feel like eating, Mae Chang?

219
00:19:29,525 --> 00:19:32,143
Since you're here, have as much as you want.

220
00:19:32,143 --> 00:19:34,047
Something quick, please.

221
00:19:34,047 --> 00:19:36,705
I'm seriously starving.

222
00:19:36,705 --> 00:19:39,228
When I wasn't eating at all,
I didn't feel it.

223
00:19:39,228 --> 00:19:42,436
But ever since I had your porridge,
I've been getting hungry all the time.

224
00:19:43,271 --> 00:19:46,154
All right, wait just a moment.

225
00:19:48,966 --> 00:19:52,529
I wish someone would film me
actually eating for once.

226
00:19:54,869 --> 00:19:57,656
How is this place so empty?

227
00:19:59,418 --> 00:20:01,366
It just happened somehow.

228
00:20:03,046 --> 00:20:05,645
What is this diner's problem, anyway?

229
00:20:05,645 --> 00:20:09,352
I mean, the food's good, the atmosphere is…

230
00:20:10,354 --> 00:20:11,713
decent.

231
00:20:11,713 --> 00:20:14,059
And it's affordable.

232
00:20:14,059 --> 00:20:17,968
I really don't know
what more I can do at this point.

233
00:20:18,957 --> 00:20:24,879
You might just be our last customer.

234
00:20:34,199 --> 00:20:35,882
Here's goldongban.

235
00:20:37,621 --> 00:20:39,978
I mean, bibimbap.

236
00:20:43,111 --> 00:20:46,662
We prepared quite a lot,
expecting more customers.

237
00:20:46,662 --> 00:20:48,946
I'm glad you're here to eat some, at least.

238
00:20:48,946 --> 00:20:53,135
Why are you two so down today?

239
00:20:53,135 --> 00:20:55,546
You're not the only ones struggling here

240
00:20:55,546 --> 00:20:58,803
I'm flopping too!

241
00:20:58,803 --> 00:21:03,808
So let's not sit here
acting like it's the end of the world.

242
00:21:03,808 --> 00:21:05,689
You're right.

243
00:21:05,689 --> 00:21:08,349
It's not like I was ever a success anyway.

244
00:21:09,418 --> 00:21:10,853
Let's do that!

245
00:21:10,853 --> 00:21:12,691
Yeah, exactly.

246
00:21:12,691 --> 00:21:15,780
By the way, is this soy sauce?

247
00:21:15,780 --> 00:21:17,185
Where's the gochujang?

248
00:21:17,185 --> 00:21:20,715
Try it first.
If you don't like it, I'll switch it.

249
00:21:33,560 --> 00:21:35,945
It's amazing.

250
00:21:35,945 --> 00:21:38,947
Is this the same soy sauce I know?

251
00:21:38,947 --> 00:21:43,137
I simmered it with clams and vegetables
for a deeper flavor.

252
00:21:45,375 --> 00:21:48,389
Take your time eating, no need to rush.

253
00:21:50,152 --> 00:21:53,633
I need to show people how well I can eat.

254
00:21:55,138 --> 00:21:56,477
Eun Sil.

255
00:21:57,598 --> 00:21:59,595
Film me!

256
00:22:01,399 --> 00:22:03,041
Me?

257
00:22:03,041 --> 00:22:05,654
Just act like you're not the owner

258
00:22:05,654 --> 00:22:07,957
like you just happened to walk in for a meal

259
00:22:07,957 --> 00:22:10,617
and stumbled upon
the lovely Jung Mi Sol enjoying her food.

260
00:22:10,617 --> 00:22:12,755
Something like that.

261
00:22:14,089 --> 00:22:16,628
Why should I?

262
00:22:16,628 --> 00:22:17,938
At least one of us should make it.

263
00:22:17,938 --> 00:22:20,015
We can't all go down together.

264
00:22:20,605 --> 00:22:23,089
Make sure it shows clearly up to here.

265
00:22:23,089 --> 00:22:24,754
Okay.

266
00:22:43,020 --> 00:22:44,590
Here you go.

267
00:22:44,590 --> 00:22:47,090
You do know I'm single-handedly
raising your sales, right?

268
00:22:47,090 --> 00:22:49,856
I should be your VIP.

269
00:22:50,503 --> 00:22:52,567
A VIP at a diner?

270
00:22:52,567 --> 00:22:53,952
What was that?

271
00:22:53,952 --> 00:22:55,538
Nothing.

272
00:22:56,785 --> 00:22:58,741
Don't fight when I'm gone.

273
00:22:58,741 --> 00:23:01,535
I hope you two run this business peacefully.

274
00:23:01,535 --> 00:23:03,694
Will do. Get home safe.

275
00:23:03,694 --> 00:23:05,165
Okay, bye.

276
00:23:05,165 --> 00:23:06,715
See you.

277
00:23:12,397 --> 00:23:14,583
We should head inside.

278
00:23:16,297 --> 00:23:18,360
Mr. Homeless.

279
00:23:21,402 --> 00:23:24,138
I've been thinking.

280
00:23:24,138 --> 00:23:26,554
You truly are gifted.

281
00:23:26,554 --> 00:23:31,372
I knew your talent was something
anyone would want.

282
00:23:31,977 --> 00:23:35,715
And I've always felt bad for not giving you

283
00:23:35,715 --> 00:23:38,055
the treatment you deserved.

284
00:23:40,096 --> 00:23:43,484
But now that there's a place
willing to do that.

285
00:23:43,484 --> 00:23:45,794
I'm truly happy for you.

286
00:23:45,794 --> 00:23:48,300
This works out well for all of us.

287
00:23:49,146 --> 00:23:51,706
I'll cover the madam's hospital bills.

288
00:23:53,335 --> 00:23:56,256
Why would you do that?

289
00:23:56,256 --> 00:23:58,665
You should be careful.

290
00:23:58,665 --> 00:24:00,861
You can't go around giving money
to someone you barely know.

291
00:24:00,861 --> 00:24:04,516
Do this for the wrong person,
and you'll be taken advantage of.

292
00:24:04,516 --> 00:24:07,428
I don't need money.

293
00:24:07,428 --> 00:24:11,467
I only considered another job
because I needed to confirm something.

294
00:24:11,467 --> 00:24:13,761
That's all there is to it.

295
00:24:13,761 --> 00:24:18,846
- So, take my earnings for your mother's hospital...
- I'll handle my mom's hospital bills myself

296
00:24:21,407 --> 00:24:25,094
by selling this diner.

297
00:24:27,543 --> 00:24:29,457
That should cover the cost.

298
00:24:29,457 --> 00:24:35,024
But you said you'd keep the place
until she woke up.

299
00:24:35,024 --> 00:24:37,100
Life doesn't go as planned.

300
00:24:38,935 --> 00:24:40,964
Come to think of it,

301
00:24:40,964 --> 00:24:44,118
I don't think it ever went as planned.

302
00:24:47,294 --> 00:24:49,817
Enough talking.

303
00:24:51,001 --> 00:24:55,756
I wish you all the best.

304
00:24:56,523 --> 00:24:58,219
Young lady.

305
00:24:59,325 --> 00:25:01,907
Thank you for everything.

306
00:25:07,473 --> 00:25:09,269
Young lady!

307
00:25:20,853 --> 00:25:24,776
She held onto this place all this time, but why...

308
00:25:32,715 --> 00:25:34,252
Wait.

309
00:25:34,252 --> 00:25:35,848
This is...

310
00:25:36,737 --> 00:25:39,749
I took care of the sign while I was out.

311
00:25:39,749 --> 00:25:41,414
I picked a name for the restaurant.

312
00:25:41,414 --> 00:25:43,035
What did you name it?

313
00:25:43,035 --> 00:25:46,168
You'll see for yourself later.

314
00:25:46,168 --> 00:25:48,434
[Heo's Diner]

315
00:25:49,236 --> 00:25:51,385
So, she knew my name.

316
00:25:57,772 --> 00:26:01,010
[Dorae]

317
00:26:01,999 --> 00:26:03,718
However,

318
00:26:03,718 --> 00:26:06,422
I must find a way to return.

319
00:26:42,580 --> 00:26:45,649
I know you were always tied to the diner.

320
00:26:46,812 --> 00:26:49,688
But Mom, we don't have a single photo
of us on a trip together.

321
00:26:58,501 --> 00:27:02,288
Back then, all I wanted was
to escape this place.

322
00:27:06,421 --> 00:27:08,221
Mom, I'm here.

323
00:27:15,087 --> 00:27:17,507
I've decided...

324
00:27:17,507 --> 00:27:19,234
to close the diner.

325
00:27:21,934 --> 00:27:25,660
Selling meals for 5,000 won
barely makes any money

326
00:27:26,540 --> 00:27:29,096
and it's just too exhausting.

327
00:27:30,753 --> 00:27:32,997
I guess this is just who I am.

328
00:27:35,612 --> 00:27:39,103
I've never been able to see
anything through.

329
00:27:40,965 --> 00:27:43,865
I keep getting fired from jobs,
one after another...

330
00:27:50,894 --> 00:27:53,254
I'm sorry, Mom.

331
00:28:03,072 --> 00:28:07,252
I wanted to hold out until you came back...

332
00:28:14,110 --> 00:28:18,017
but I don't even know why I'm like this.

333
00:28:42,905 --> 00:28:44,851
Miss.

334
00:28:44,851 --> 00:28:46,147
Hello.

335
00:28:46,147 --> 00:28:50,244
A little while ago,
your mother's nephew came to visit.

336
00:28:51,371 --> 00:28:53,923
- My mom's nephew?
- Yes.

337
00:28:53,923 --> 00:28:57,127
He was very persistent,
so I let him in just for a moment

338
00:28:57,127 --> 00:28:59,405
but I wanted to let you know.

339
00:28:59,405 --> 00:29:00,571
I see.

340
00:29:00,571 --> 00:29:02,783
He seemed really concerned about her

341
00:29:02,783 --> 00:29:04,978
and asked a lot of questions about her

342
00:29:04,978 --> 00:29:07,542
but I didn't say anything
due to medical privacy laws.

343
00:29:07,542 --> 00:29:10,435
Okay, thank you.

344
00:29:11,694 --> 00:29:13,340
Who could it be?

345
00:29:13,340 --> 00:29:16,671
[Dorae]

346
00:29:21,530 --> 00:29:23,246
Eun Sil.

347
00:29:24,820 --> 00:29:28,930
I'm sorry for dropping by unannounced.

348
00:29:29,722 --> 00:29:32,230
No need to apologize.

349
00:29:32,230 --> 00:29:33,847
Have a seat.

350
00:29:42,455 --> 00:29:45,190
So, what brings you here?

351
00:29:47,286 --> 00:29:49,382
I know this is shameless of me,

352
00:29:49,382 --> 00:29:53,139
but I came to beg you to buy our diner.

353
00:29:54,349 --> 00:29:56,499
You haven't forgotten, have you?

354
00:29:56,499 --> 00:30:00,484
You once said you'd buy it at a good price.

355
00:30:04,956 --> 00:30:08,821
Are you closing the diner?

356
00:30:10,157 --> 00:30:11,667
Yes.

357
00:30:13,665 --> 00:30:17,706
I should've never run a restaurant
when I can't even cook.

358
00:30:19,937 --> 00:30:23,297
Am I too late?

359
00:30:23,297 --> 00:30:25,365
No, not at all.

360
00:30:25,365 --> 00:30:28,999
I told you to come anytime, didn't I?

361
00:30:28,999 --> 00:30:32,319
Let's move forward right away.

362
00:30:48,397 --> 00:30:50,288
Right away?

363
00:30:51,380 --> 00:30:54,536
Didn't you already made up your mind?

364
00:30:55,461 --> 00:30:58,378
Yes, I did.

365
00:30:58,378 --> 00:31:01,367
I just didn't think it'd happen this fast...

366
00:31:03,944 --> 00:31:05,281
You know what?

367
00:31:05,281 --> 00:31:07,755
Let's just get it done and dusted.

368
00:31:08,360 --> 00:31:09,812
Do I sign here?

369
00:31:09,812 --> 00:31:10,853
Yes.

370
00:31:10,853 --> 00:31:12,472
Right here.

371
00:31:13,523 --> 00:31:15,207
Stop right there!

372
00:31:23,659 --> 00:31:26,792
How did you know I was here?

373
00:31:29,088 --> 00:31:31,683
Are you here to bother the chef again?

374
00:31:31,683 --> 00:31:34,279
I told you to stop that!

375
00:31:39,261 --> 00:31:41,415
I'm sorry,

376
00:31:42,774 --> 00:31:45,736
but this will be the last time.

377
00:31:45,736 --> 00:31:50,039
Mr. Homeless is leaving our diner
for another place.

378
00:31:50,039 --> 00:31:52,536
So, this won't happen again.

379
00:31:55,451 --> 00:31:57,703
I need an explanation, young lady.

380
00:31:58,504 --> 00:32:01,366
I'm handing over the diner to Chef Lee.

381
00:32:01,990 --> 00:32:04,298
I've already made up my mind.

382
00:32:08,200 --> 00:32:10,475
What should we do with this?

383
00:32:10,475 --> 00:32:13,835
It's fine. I'll get you a new one right away.

384
00:32:13,835 --> 00:32:18,792
Are you truly willing to sell the place
your mother built with blood and sweat?

385
00:32:21,684 --> 00:32:23,787
Stay out of this, mister.

386
00:32:23,787 --> 00:32:25,476
The diner is my business to handle.

387
00:32:25,476 --> 00:32:28,809
Excuse me, it's not just a diner.

388
00:32:30,655 --> 00:32:32,710
It's Heo's Diner.

389
00:32:35,001 --> 00:32:38,900
And since the diner bears my name
and I run the kitchen as suksu.

390
00:32:38,900 --> 00:32:41,241
[Suksu: Cook]
I have a say in this.

391
00:32:44,344 --> 00:32:46,397
Let's go.

392
00:32:46,397 --> 00:32:48,585
What do you think you're doing?!

393
00:32:51,048 --> 00:32:53,039
Let go of her arm.

394
00:32:56,722 --> 00:32:59,103
Gwansong, I'm very sorry.

395
00:32:59,103 --> 00:33:02,656
I cannot stand by
and watch this deal happen.

396
00:33:03,248 --> 00:33:06,223
You said you were leaving for a better place,
so why are you doing this?

397
00:33:06,223 --> 00:33:07,779
No.

398
00:33:08,629 --> 00:33:10,759
I'm not going anywhere.

399
00:33:11,435 --> 00:33:13,931
I'm staying at Heo's Diner.

400
00:33:15,110 --> 00:33:19,116
Even if you stay, there are no customers.

401
00:33:19,116 --> 00:33:21,763
There's no hope!

402
00:33:21,763 --> 00:33:25,202
Whether we make it or break it,
let's at least see it through to the end.

403
00:33:26,307 --> 00:33:28,513
Isn't that what you want too?

404
00:33:29,111 --> 00:33:31,324
No, I've had enough.

405
00:33:31,324 --> 00:33:32,758
I'm sick and tired of it now.

406
00:33:32,758 --> 00:33:35,333
I don't want to do it anymore.

407
00:33:35,333 --> 00:33:37,235
If that's true,

408
00:33:37,235 --> 00:33:40,670
why did you cry your heart out
in front of your mother?

409
00:33:41,264 --> 00:33:44,389
How do you know that...

410
00:33:47,231 --> 00:33:49,093
Let's go.

411
00:33:49,093 --> 00:33:53,437
If you don't want to regret it later,
let's give it everything we've got now.

412
00:33:54,536 --> 00:33:57,094
I know this is what you want.

413
00:34:01,775 --> 00:34:02,828
Eun Sil!

414
00:34:02,828 --> 00:34:03,971
Young lady!

415
00:34:03,971 --> 00:34:06,279
Wait a moment.

416
00:34:06,279 --> 00:34:09,402
Gyosan, don't you still have
unfinished business with me?

417
00:34:16,709 --> 00:34:19,675
I regretfully decline your offer.

418
00:34:20,432 --> 00:34:23,468
It pains me because
I genuinely wanted to work alongside you

419
00:34:23,468 --> 00:34:26,437
to get to know you better, to grow closer.

420
00:34:26,437 --> 00:34:28,565
Then, why?

421
00:34:28,565 --> 00:34:31,537
Even a beast repays kindness when it's saved.

422
00:34:31,537 --> 00:34:33,743
Turning my back at a time like this

423
00:34:33,743 --> 00:34:36,532
wouldn't be something a person should do.

424
00:34:37,636 --> 00:34:42,043
Even if it means delaying my own path,

425
00:34:43,186 --> 00:34:45,793
this is something worth staying for.

426
00:34:45,793 --> 00:34:50,544
All because of a single meal?

427
00:34:50,544 --> 00:34:53,020
Yes, it was a single meal.

428
00:34:53,020 --> 00:34:55,524
But it saved me.

429
00:34:56,361 --> 00:34:58,911
Even if I can't work with you...

430
00:34:58,911 --> 00:35:03,767
if you ever need my cooking,
I will always be willing to help.

431
00:35:03,767 --> 00:35:06,328
Who do you think you are,
offering to help me?

432
00:35:06,328 --> 00:35:08,097
I was the one offering to help you.

433
00:35:08,097 --> 00:35:11,433
I don't need your cooking.

434
00:35:12,955 --> 00:35:16,689
I can make better food with my eyes closed.

435
00:35:17,454 --> 00:35:19,500
Well, of course.

436
00:35:19,500 --> 00:35:21,909
You are the finest suksu, after all.

437
00:35:21,909 --> 00:35:24,464
Forgive my audacity.

438
00:35:28,345 --> 00:35:30,729
You'll regret turning down my offer

439
00:35:30,729 --> 00:35:33,504
- for the rest...
- "For the rest of your life?"

440
00:35:37,947 --> 00:35:40,611
This may be your first time saying it

441
00:35:40,611 --> 00:35:43,031
but I've heard it before.

442
00:35:43,750 --> 00:35:45,905
What do you mean?

443
00:35:45,905 --> 00:35:51,639
So please, don't resent me for this.

444
00:35:52,723 --> 00:35:56,449
I still need your help.

445
00:35:57,388 --> 00:35:59,658
Seriously...

446
00:35:59,658 --> 00:36:04,791
The more I learn about you,
the stranger you become.

447
00:36:29,980 --> 00:36:32,913
You went to see my mom at the hospital?

448
00:36:35,010 --> 00:36:38,468
Yes, I visited her.

449
00:36:38,468 --> 00:36:43,149
So, you heard everything I told her?

450
00:36:44,098 --> 00:36:47,705
It wasn't intentional, but yes, I did.

451
00:36:49,125 --> 00:36:51,262
This is so embarrassing.

452
00:36:52,362 --> 00:36:56,238
I never meant to make her cry.

453
00:36:58,000 --> 00:37:00,019
I'm to blame for everything.

454
00:37:03,071 --> 00:37:07,315
I assure you, I'll never be
the reason for her tears again.

455
00:37:07,315 --> 00:37:09,735
Rest assured.

456
00:37:12,723 --> 00:37:15,135
I heard you pretended to be my mom's nephew

457
00:37:15,135 --> 00:37:18,035
to ask the nurse about her condition.

458
00:37:19,170 --> 00:37:22,610
I sneaked inside, avoiding the nurses.

459
00:37:22,610 --> 00:37:25,268
Because I learned my lesson last time.

460
00:37:26,784 --> 00:37:28,906
Then, who was it?

461
00:37:29,737 --> 00:37:34,100
Let's not waste time
and prepare for business.

462
00:37:34,819 --> 00:37:36,565
Business? Who are we serving?

463
00:37:36,565 --> 00:37:38,463
We need customers for that.

464
00:37:39,756 --> 00:37:42,861
Looks like another day
of twiddling our thumbs.

465
00:37:42,861 --> 00:37:45,154
Again!

466
00:37:45,154 --> 00:37:47,111
Did I not say words have power?

467
00:37:47,834 --> 00:37:50,663
Now then, repeat after me.

468
00:37:51,432 --> 00:37:54,259
Heo's Diner, let's make it big!

469
00:37:54,259 --> 00:37:56,825
No, why would I do such a thing?

470
00:37:56,825 --> 00:38:00,129
Don't you want Heo's Diner to succeed?

471
00:38:03,079 --> 00:38:05,194
Heo's Diner, let's make it big.

472
00:38:05,194 --> 00:38:07,752
No! Louder!

473
00:38:07,752 --> 00:38:10,247
Heo's Diner, let's make it big!

474
00:38:12,493 --> 00:38:14,819
Heo's Diner, let's make it big!

475
00:38:14,819 --> 00:38:17,298
Heo's Diner, let's go!

476
00:38:17,298 --> 00:38:19,603
Heo's Diner, let's go!

477
00:38:21,050 --> 00:38:22,244
Excuse me...

478
00:38:22,244 --> 00:38:26,518
Is this the place Jung Mi Sol visited?

479
00:38:26,518 --> 00:38:28,097
Yes, it is.

480
00:38:28,097 --> 00:38:29,946
This is the place!

481
00:38:29,946 --> 00:38:31,644
No way!

482
00:38:31,644 --> 00:38:34,516
See? I told you.

483
00:38:34,516 --> 00:38:36,649
Please take a seat.

484
00:38:36,649 --> 00:38:39,110
Welcome.

485
00:38:39,110 --> 00:38:42,216
Here are two pork kimchi stews.

486
00:38:46,297 --> 00:38:48,369
Enjoy.

487
00:38:48,369 --> 00:38:50,091
This looks amazing.

488
00:38:52,905 --> 00:38:56,127
- How do you know Jung Mi Sol?
- Sorry?

489
00:38:56,127 --> 00:38:59,798
You asked if this was the place she visited.

490
00:38:59,798 --> 00:39:02,597
You haven't seen her bibimbap video?

491
00:39:02,597 --> 00:39:05,669
She probably doesn't know it went viral.

492
00:39:18,816 --> 00:39:22,030
When did she even get it edited
and uploaded everywhere?

493
00:39:23,779 --> 00:39:26,553
One million views in a day?

494
00:39:31,715 --> 00:39:35,723
Heo's Diner in Seonbuk-dong,
approved by Jung Mi Sol.

495
00:39:35,723 --> 00:39:39,086
You can find it on the search engine.

496
00:39:39,086 --> 00:39:42,170
I've been there, and it was amazing.

497
00:39:42,170 --> 00:39:44,553
Heo's Diner is the best!

498
00:39:45,207 --> 00:39:47,768
Heo's Diner serves new menus daily.
5,000 won per serving.

499
00:39:47,768 --> 00:39:49,953
Is this price real?

500
00:39:52,226 --> 00:39:54,688
Owner of Heo's Diner coming through.

501
00:39:58,478 --> 00:39:59,525
- Welcome.
- Do you have a table for two?

502
00:39:59,525 --> 00:40:01,008
Yes.

503
00:40:20,605 --> 00:40:22,480
Who's that?

504
00:40:29,649 --> 00:40:30,719
Hello?

505
00:40:30,719 --> 00:40:34,306
Your VIP is here,
and you're just letting me stand around?

506
00:40:36,081 --> 00:40:37,880
Come and sit over here.

507
00:40:42,003 --> 00:40:44,591
You must've been working today.

508
00:40:44,591 --> 00:40:46,503
No?

509
00:40:46,503 --> 00:40:48,767
I was at home.

510
00:40:48,767 --> 00:40:51,666
But your outfit...

511
00:40:51,666 --> 00:40:54,570
This is just my neighborhood look.

512
00:40:55,780 --> 00:40:59,053
A fancy face with a not-so-fancy palate.

513
00:40:59,053 --> 00:41:01,455
This is what drives people wild.

514
00:41:03,731 --> 00:41:05,480
Feel free to take pictures.

515
00:41:05,480 --> 00:41:07,348
Please upload them.

516
00:41:09,813 --> 00:41:12,635
Anyway, thanks.

517
00:41:14,629 --> 00:41:16,944
Looks like the place is blowing up
thanks to you.

518
00:41:16,944 --> 00:41:18,620
I know, right?

519
00:41:18,620 --> 00:41:22,302
This type of celebrity marketing
comes with a price.

520
00:41:22,302 --> 00:41:25,701
But since we were all flopping together,
I'll do it for free.

521
00:41:25,701 --> 00:41:27,789
Yeah, yeah.

522
00:41:27,789 --> 00:41:32,438
From now on, you're the VVIP of Heo's Diner.

523
00:41:32,438 --> 00:41:34,170
Mae Chang!

524
00:41:41,091 --> 00:41:42,668
Here.

525
00:41:44,713 --> 00:41:47,364
I added extra meat to your stew, Mae Chang.

526
00:41:47,364 --> 00:41:48,615
You're the best!

527
00:41:48,615 --> 00:41:51,318
How did you know I was craving meat?

528
00:41:51,318 --> 00:41:52,822
Thank you.

529
00:41:56,813 --> 00:42:00,891
What a shame...
If only he was as famous as Lee Hyuk.

530
00:42:00,891 --> 00:42:03,693
I could've skyrocketed his fame
with a dating scandal.

531
00:42:05,073 --> 00:42:07,125
Who would he even date?

532
00:42:07,125 --> 00:42:09,697
Who else? Me, obviously.

533
00:42:09,697 --> 00:42:12,114
He's single, right?

534
00:42:12,114 --> 00:42:13,782
Yeah.

535
00:42:13,782 --> 00:42:16,536
Okay, then I call dibs!

536
00:42:16,536 --> 00:42:18,806
Eun Sil, can you get me some water?

537
00:42:18,806 --> 00:42:21,538
Water is self-serve! Self-serve!

538
00:42:21,538 --> 00:42:22,640
What?

539
00:42:22,640 --> 00:42:25,875
You said I was the VVIP!

540
00:42:33,683 --> 00:42:39,530
The dignitary hopes to introduce
state guests to traditional Korean flavors.

541
00:42:57,616 --> 00:42:59,053
She asked, "Can I eat this?"

542
00:42:59,053 --> 00:43:00,502
- Seriously?
- No, you can't!

543
00:43:00,502 --> 00:43:02,567
What's that about?

544
00:43:05,927 --> 00:43:10,476
Didn't I tell you not to interrupt me
while I'm developing a recipe?

545
00:43:10,476 --> 00:43:12,176
We're sorry.

546
00:43:27,490 --> 00:43:31,871
If you ever need my cooking,
I will always be willing to help.

547
00:43:36,594 --> 00:43:39,181
How dare he...

548
00:43:42,846 --> 00:43:44,705
Well, what do we have here?

549
00:43:45,724 --> 00:43:48,117
Aren't you Chef Lee?

550
00:43:48,117 --> 00:43:49,420
Long time no see.

551
00:43:49,420 --> 00:43:51,160
What brings you here?

552
00:43:51,160 --> 00:43:53,512
Are you here to harm me again?

553
00:43:54,498 --> 00:43:58,871
Let me be clear,
if you try anything like last time…

554
00:43:59,638 --> 00:44:02,883
I'll make sure you don't get to
wander around so freely.

555
00:44:02,883 --> 00:44:07,080
Relax, I'm not here to start trouble.
I just came to eat.

556
00:44:07,080 --> 00:44:08,726
Don't be so paranoid.

557
00:44:10,298 --> 00:44:15,372
Jung Mi Sol, you're banned
from ever stepping foot in my restaurant.

558
00:44:15,372 --> 00:44:18,779
Who said I wanted to?

559
00:44:18,779 --> 00:44:20,899
I only eat at Heo's Diner.

560
00:44:20,899 --> 00:44:24,798
At least their food doesn't sit
like a rock in my stomach.

561
00:44:27,760 --> 00:44:30,583
Why couldn't they have put
another restaurant across from Heo's Diner?

562
00:44:31,429 --> 00:44:36,215
Anyway, as a VIP,
I'll be visiting Heo's Diner often.

563
00:44:36,215 --> 00:44:38,822
Let's do our best to avoid each other.

564
00:44:38,822 --> 00:44:41,038
I'd rather not ruin my appetite.

565
00:44:58,608 --> 00:45:00,622
Welcome.

566
00:45:04,021 --> 00:45:06,107
Please have a seat over here.

567
00:45:13,470 --> 00:45:16,481
Excuse me? Can we change seats?

568
00:45:18,427 --> 00:45:21,356
I'm sorry, but there are
no other seats available.

569
00:45:21,356 --> 00:45:23,601
Then, send this old man out.

570
00:45:23,601 --> 00:45:25,756
How are we supposed to eat like this?

571
00:45:25,756 --> 00:45:29,566
I'm sorry, but we can't ask a customer
to leave for that reason.

572
00:45:29,566 --> 00:45:34,107
If you feel that way,
you're free to leave instead.

573
00:45:34,107 --> 00:45:36,162
Would you like to cancel your order?

574
00:45:37,830 --> 00:45:40,162
Unbelievable.

575
00:45:40,162 --> 00:45:42,891
Come on, let's go.

576
00:45:49,198 --> 00:45:51,264
Would you like a set?

577
00:45:55,446 --> 00:45:58,684
All right, one set coming right up!

578
00:46:15,378 --> 00:46:17,677
Don't worry about it.

579
00:46:20,091 --> 00:46:25,399
Do I look like a shameless old man
who came to eat for free?

580
00:46:25,399 --> 00:46:27,511
That's not what I meant...

581
00:46:28,317 --> 00:46:29,747
Sir!

582
00:46:29,747 --> 00:46:32,202
You should take your change.

583
00:46:33,655 --> 00:46:36,460
Then, take care.

584
00:46:37,107 --> 00:46:40,051
How is your mother doing?

585
00:46:42,751 --> 00:46:44,643
Do you know my mom?

586
00:46:44,643 --> 00:46:47,512
I used to come here to eat
from time to time.

587
00:46:47,512 --> 00:46:49,600
She was a truly kind person…

588
00:46:49,600 --> 00:46:52,061
It's such a shame what happened to her.

589
00:46:52,061 --> 00:46:54,202
Thank you.

590
00:46:55,336 --> 00:46:57,766
She hasn't gotten any better.

591
00:47:06,909 --> 00:47:09,053
Why are you giving this to me?

592
00:47:11,807 --> 00:47:15,321
It's going to rain, a heavy one.

593
00:47:27,556 --> 00:47:30,091
Excuse me...

594
00:47:30,091 --> 00:47:34,036
I heard that the patient in the ICU
is in critical condition.

595
00:47:34,036 --> 00:47:36,673
Could you give me an update
on her current status?

596
00:47:36,673 --> 00:47:38,810
I'm just really anxious…

597
00:47:39,436 --> 00:47:41,732
One moment, please.

598
00:47:41,732 --> 00:47:43,138
Which patient's guardian are you?

599
00:47:43,138 --> 00:47:45,382
This one right here

600
00:47:45,382 --> 00:47:47,424
I'm her nephew.

601
00:47:47,424 --> 00:47:49,397
We've taken all the necessary measures

602
00:47:49,397 --> 00:47:52,663
but we'll need to monitor
the situation over time.

603
00:47:52,663 --> 00:47:55,226
Okay, thank you.

604
00:47:59,324 --> 00:48:03,954
Neither alive nor dead.

605
00:48:04,857 --> 00:48:07,308
She's unconscious and unresponsive.

606
00:48:07,308 --> 00:48:10,279
Still breathing just as she was
at the time of the accident.

607
00:48:10,279 --> 00:48:14,025
But her independent breathing is weakening.

608
00:48:14,025 --> 00:48:16,913
How long do they think she has?

609
00:48:16,913 --> 00:48:18,401
Who knows?

610
00:48:18,401 --> 00:48:21,325
They don't really share
that kind of information.

611
00:48:21,325 --> 00:48:23,298
Hospital staff are strict.

612
00:48:23,298 --> 00:48:27,490
Even if you're the police,
they'll tell you to bring a warrant.

613
00:48:27,490 --> 00:48:31,519
This is all I managed to find out.

614
00:48:33,560 --> 00:48:38,722
I wish she'd just disappear already.

615
00:48:40,091 --> 00:48:43,005
Come on, you shouldn't say such a thing.

616
00:48:48,317 --> 00:48:50,528
What did you just say?

617
00:48:52,311 --> 00:48:54,320
It's nothing.

618
00:49:03,317 --> 00:49:07,831
I know I'm running errands for him,

619
00:49:07,831 --> 00:49:11,393
but I'm a cop. He should mind what he says.

620
00:49:15,459 --> 00:49:17,140
[Unconscious, unresponsive, same condition,
independent breathing weakening.]

621
00:49:18,791 --> 00:49:22,461
Getting treated like a fool
by some snot-nosed kid…

622
00:49:22,461 --> 00:49:24,894
How much longer
do I have to put up with this?

623
00:49:53,610 --> 00:49:55,361
Hey there.

624
00:49:55,361 --> 00:49:57,698
One moment.

625
00:49:57,698 --> 00:50:00,073
I was trying to slip by quietly.

626
00:50:00,073 --> 00:50:01,977
Forget that.

627
00:50:01,977 --> 00:50:04,746
Go buy a set menu from the diner nearby.

628
00:50:04,746 --> 00:50:07,107
Why...

629
00:50:09,522 --> 00:50:12,590
I just noticed earlier that they were closed.

630
00:50:12,590 --> 00:50:17,460
Seems like they shut down
as soon as they run out of ingredients.

631
00:50:22,671 --> 00:50:25,258
I see. You can go.

632
00:50:26,739 --> 00:50:28,960
[Huge bonus gifts]
[Maximum subsidy support]

633
00:50:30,605 --> 00:50:32,628
I have never seen colors like these before.

634
00:50:32,628 --> 00:50:35,113
They are truly mesmerizing.

635
00:50:36,170 --> 00:50:38,117
What kind of color is this?

636
00:50:38,117 --> 00:50:40,403
- Would you like to see it?
- Yes, please.

637
00:50:40,403 --> 00:50:43,272
- This one, too!
- This one as well?

638
00:50:43,272 --> 00:50:44,975
I want to see it.

639
00:50:45,668 --> 00:50:47,559
- This is...
- Mister.

640
00:50:47,559 --> 00:50:49,533
Here, come over here.

641
00:50:50,806 --> 00:50:52,762
Choose one from here.

642
00:50:52,762 --> 00:50:54,420
Right here.

643
00:50:55,472 --> 00:51:00,122
With this, you can freeze moments in time,
just like Mae Chang did?

644
00:51:00,122 --> 00:51:01,797
Yes, you can film videos.

645
00:51:01,797 --> 00:51:03,958
Pick a fight.

646
00:51:05,061 --> 00:51:07,301
Yes, leave comments.

647
00:51:07,301 --> 00:51:10,034
Can I also track down someone?

648
00:51:10,034 --> 00:51:12,981
Yes, you can access the Internet.

649
00:51:13,748 --> 00:51:16,077
Splendid.

650
00:51:16,077 --> 00:51:19,235
Then, how about this...

651
00:51:19,235 --> 00:51:21,664
They're all pretty much the same.

652
00:51:21,664 --> 00:51:23,603
We'll take this one.

653
00:51:26,929 --> 00:51:28,807
Got it.

654
00:51:28,807 --> 00:51:31,089
Yes, I'm Bong Eun Sil

655
00:51:31,089 --> 00:51:33,324
and I can hear you clearly.

656
00:51:35,272 --> 00:51:37,143
Can you still hear me?

657
00:51:42,008 --> 00:51:43,959
Can you hear me?

658
00:51:46,759 --> 00:51:49,021
Can you really hear me?

659
00:51:50,404 --> 00:51:51,819
This is unbelievable!

660
00:51:51,819 --> 00:51:55,832
How does it sound so clear from afar?

661
00:51:55,832 --> 00:51:58,540
We can talk without the phone now.

662
00:51:58,540 --> 00:52:00,401
Oh, right!

663
00:52:00,401 --> 00:52:03,893
It sounds so real, I nearly forgot!

664
00:52:04,909 --> 00:52:09,090
Wherever you go,
make sure you keep it with you.

665
00:52:09,090 --> 00:52:13,565
Every time you disappear, my heart drops.

666
00:52:15,866 --> 00:52:19,370
Because you fear never seeing me again?

667
00:52:19,370 --> 00:52:22,339
Because I fear the diner won't open.

668
00:52:23,855 --> 00:52:28,135
Understood.
I'll keep it in my grasp at all times.

669
00:52:35,626 --> 00:52:39,696
But why are you carrying that around?

670
00:52:39,696 --> 00:52:42,567
Someone said it might rain today.

671
00:52:42,567 --> 00:52:44,233
Rain?

672
00:52:47,505 --> 00:52:49,782
The sky is clear.

673
00:52:50,544 --> 00:52:51,766
You're right.

674
00:52:51,766 --> 00:52:55,047
Even the weather forecast
said nothing about rain…

675
00:52:55,816 --> 00:53:00,154
But for some reason,
I felt like I should bring it.

676
00:53:08,064 --> 00:53:11,333
Just what on earth is the problem?

677
00:53:16,032 --> 00:53:18,331
Excuse me, sir.

678
00:53:19,473 --> 00:53:22,075
It's time to prepare for dinner service.

679
00:53:22,975 --> 00:53:25,241
Should I tell them to wait a little longer?

680
00:53:27,129 --> 00:53:29,478
No.

681
00:53:29,478 --> 00:53:33,482
I'll just step out for a moment.
Make sure everything's ready.

682
00:54:00,845 --> 00:54:02,528
Anyone here?

683
00:54:04,160 --> 00:54:05,839
Eun Sil?

684
00:54:08,278 --> 00:54:09,963
Gyosan?

685
00:55:01,399 --> 00:55:03,633
This is truly fascinating.

686
00:55:03,633 --> 00:55:05,789
How can something so small...

687
00:55:09,478 --> 00:55:13,583
Can this also play music called an "alarm?"

688
00:55:13,583 --> 00:55:16,026
How do you even know about alarms?

689
00:55:17,128 --> 00:55:20,210
Yeah, you can set alarms and ringtones too.

690
00:55:20,210 --> 00:55:22,007
What would you like?

691
00:55:23,323 --> 00:55:26,360
I liked Gwansong's music.

692
00:55:26,990 --> 00:55:29,620
It sounded strangely familiar.

693
00:55:29,620 --> 00:55:31,964
Chef Lee's?

694
00:55:31,964 --> 00:55:36,290
Then it's probably not a default tone
He must have saved it manually.

695
00:55:36,290 --> 00:55:38,412
If you don't know the title,
I can't set it for you.

696
00:55:38,412 --> 00:55:40,115
Is that so?

697
00:55:40,115 --> 00:55:42,111
What a shame.

698
00:55:44,738 --> 00:55:46,298
It looks like it's going to rain.

699
00:55:46,298 --> 00:55:48,180
Let's hurry.

700
00:56:35,221 --> 00:56:38,230
Wow, it really is raining.

701
00:56:38,230 --> 00:56:40,133
I got goosebumps.

702
00:56:40,133 --> 00:56:42,523
How did that old man know?

703
00:56:43,513 --> 00:56:45,472
I despise rainy days.

704
00:56:45,472 --> 00:56:46,856
Let's hurry.

705
00:56:46,856 --> 00:56:48,213
Really?

706
00:56:48,213 --> 00:56:49,899
I like the rain.

707
00:56:49,899 --> 00:56:54,068
Try to listen.
Doesn't it sound just like music?

708
00:56:55,258 --> 00:56:57,598
You're sentimental for no reason.

709
00:56:57,598 --> 00:56:59,537
Let's hurry.

710
00:56:59,537 --> 00:57:02,075
It's coming down harder than I thought.

711
00:57:02,075 --> 00:57:04,160
That was so sudden…

712
00:57:04,160 --> 00:57:05,922
Oh, chef!

713
00:57:11,565 --> 00:57:13,612
You must be freezing in the rain.

714
00:57:13,612 --> 00:57:17,626
Where are you headed?

715
00:57:19,515 --> 00:57:22,291
Oh, well, I was...

716
00:57:27,433 --> 00:57:30,427
Where did you get this umbrella?

717
00:57:31,707 --> 00:57:33,390
You should take this.

718
00:57:33,390 --> 00:57:35,810
We can just run inside.

719
00:57:37,299 --> 00:57:39,280
No, uh...

720
00:57:39,280 --> 00:57:41,618
Where did you get this?

721
00:57:41,618 --> 00:57:45,392
Some old man gave it to me.

722
00:57:45,392 --> 00:57:47,072
Why do you ask?

723
00:57:51,089 --> 00:57:53,635
Mister, we should head inside.

724
00:58:05,439 --> 00:58:07,096
Try to listen.

725
00:58:07,096 --> 00:58:09,401
Doesn't it sound just like music?

726
00:58:12,246 --> 00:58:14,661
It's music that wakes you up.

727
00:58:14,661 --> 00:58:20,125
I wake up to this music every day at 4 AM.

728
00:58:21,548 --> 00:58:25,422
I knew I heard it before,
but I couldn't remember why…

729
00:58:27,672 --> 00:58:30,127
The rain must have drowned it out.

730
00:58:30,127 --> 00:58:31,735
Wake up!

731
00:58:31,735 --> 00:58:33,375
Madam!

732
00:58:36,803 --> 00:58:40,190
Help! Is no one around?

733
00:58:41,302 --> 00:58:43,577
It was unmistakably...

734
00:58:44,595 --> 00:58:46,727
in the hour of the tiger
