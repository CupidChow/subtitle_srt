56

Are you assuming I have something
to feel guilty about, Detective Kang?

75
00:06:28,743 --> 00:06:31,581
Even went as far as
pretending to be her nephew.

76
00:06:33,625 --> 00:06:35,503
That's because...

77
00:06:36,487 --> 00:06:38,801
Was it because of Chef Lee?

79
00:06:44,471 --> 00:06:47,224
Did you really think I wouldn't find out?

80
00:06:50,988 --> 00:06:54,719
Mr. Lee asked me to do it.

81
00:06:55,480 --> 00:06:58,589
He wanted me to check on
your mother's condition.

82
00:06:58,589 --> 00:07:01,794
And that's all he asked you to do?

83
00:07:01,794 --> 00:07:05,454
Yes, that's all.

84
00:07:05,454 --> 00:07:09,192
Just to monitor her condition.

85
00:07:09,192 --> 00:07:12,370
Even if he had asked for more,
I wouldn't have done it.

the man who worked at our diner, Heo Gyun.

92
00:07:44,855 --> 00:07:47,551
He's not an ex-convict, is he?

93
00:07:50,603 --> 00:07:53,665
Tell me the truth.

94
00:07:53,665 --> 00:07:56,512
Did you actually dig up anything on him?

95
00:07:57,448 --> 00:07:59,579
The truth is…

96
00:07:59,579 --> 00:08:02,538
I couldn't find anything on him.

97
00:08:04,408 --> 00:08:07,442
Then, why did you lie...?

98
00:08:07,442 --> 00:08:09,265
I'm sorry.

I let money cloud my judgment.

100

But now that I've told you everything,
I actually feel relieved.

101
00:08:20,674 --> 00:08:22,898
I knew this wasn't right.

102
00:08:22,898 --> 00:08:25,444
And all this time, I hurt him so much

103

without even knowing the truth.

104
00:08:32,381 --> 00:08:35,417
Then, everything he said was true.

105
00:08:36,101 --> 00:08:37,991
If he was telling the truth...

106
00:08:37,991 --> 00:08:41,523
Does that mean Lee Hyuk is the one
who did this to my mom?

107
00:08:43,074 --> 00:08:45,225
That's...

108
00:08:48,520 --> 00:08:50,103
I don't know, either.

109
00:08:50,103 --> 00:08:52,042
However

110
00:08:52,042 --> 00:08:57,235
one thing is clear, Lee Hyuk
doesn't want your mother to wake up.

111
00:08:57,235 --> 00:09:01,290
That alone is suspicious.

112
00:09:01,290 --> 00:09:03,578
Because if she does

113
00:09:04,320 --> 00:09:07,117
she'll expose everything he did.

114
00:09:10,024 --> 00:09:11,771
But the problem is,

115
00:09:11,771 --> 00:09:14,602
I don't have solid proof.

116
00:09:15,636 --> 00:09:18,800
If only we had surveillance footage
from the accident site...

117
00:09:20,495 --> 00:09:22,986
How could he...

118
00:09:24,084 --> 00:09:29,119
It's not from the exact site,
but I do have footage from a different area.

119
00:09:29,119 --> 00:09:32,223
If you want, I'll give you the file.

120
00:09:33,621 --> 00:09:39,217
Looking back, that was where I went wrong.

121
00:09:39,217 --> 00:09:42,647

123
00:09:45,611 --> 00:09:49,346
that I'm sorry.

Chef Lee is running away.

125
00:10:12,695 --> 00:10:15,909
Something must've happened when he met Mom.

126
00:10:15,909 --> 00:10:18,688
And Mr. Homeless was aware of everything.

127
00:10:21,834 --> 00:10:24,070

Please answer the phone.

129

Why? What's the matter?

You know what?

155
00:12:25,008 --> 00:12:30,122
I thought I could make easy money
as long as I put my head around it.

156
00:12:30,122 --> 00:12:33,556

You should also keep this in mind.

I finally understand everything you said

162
00:13:11,023 --> 00:13:12,911
was true.

163
00:13:14,460 --> 00:13:19,082
I'm sorry for doubting you
and believing others instead.

164
00:13:21,040 --> 00:13:23,255
You must have resented me.

165
00:13:24,762 --> 00:13:26,899
I did.

166
00:13:26,899 --> 00:13:29,379
I was deeply disappointed.

167
00:13:30,778 --> 00:13:35,031
You refused to hear me out,
but you trusted Lee Hyuk without question.

168
00:13:35,031 --> 00:13:37,638
It drove me mad.

169

I'm not usually this slow to catch on.

170
00:13:44,053 --> 00:13:46,788
But the things you told me…

171
00:13:46,788 --> 00:13:50,114
They were beyond anything
I could comprehend.

172
00:13:51,210 --> 00:13:55,537
So, do you believe me now?

173
00:13:55,537 --> 00:13:59,191
Honestly, I can't say I trust you 100%.

But I'm ready to believe

175
00:14:09,056 --> 00:14:11,600
that you wrote this book,

176
00:14:11,600 --> 00:14:14,215
that you are Heo Gyun

That's right.

184
00:14:36,373 --> 00:14:38,796
And I have no doubt about it.

185
00:14:38,796 --> 00:14:40,643
But why?

186
00:14:41,611 --> 00:14:44,946
Why would he do that to my mom?

187
00:14:44,946 --> 00:14:48,194
My mom never wronged anyone.

188
00:14:49,239 --> 00:14:51,427
It's because of the diner.

189
00:14:52,663 --> 00:14:54,755
The diner?

190
00:14:54,755 --> 00:14:58,438
He's wanted that place for a long time.

191
00:14:58,438 --> 00:15:02,745
He needed Heo's Diner to expand his business.

192
00:15:03,449 --> 00:15:05,677
And when your mother refused to sell,

193
00:15:06,500 --> 00:15:08,731
he tried to get rid of her.

194
00:15:10,350 --> 00:15:13,106
I should have never let go of the diner…

195
00:15:13,106 --> 00:15:15,051
I was such a fool…

196
00:15:15,934 --> 00:15:18,154
Don't blame yourself.

197
00:15:18,154 --> 00:15:20,532
If you had refused

198
00:15:20,532 --> 00:15:24,300
you might have met the same fate
as your mother.

199
00:15:25,288 --> 00:15:27,878
I can never forgive Lee Hyuk.

200
00:15:29,227 --> 00:15:32,965
I have to make sure he pays for what he did.

201
00:15:32,965 --> 00:15:35,009
Is there a way?

202
00:15:35,009 --> 00:15:39,828
I will find the proof to bring him down.

203
00:15:39,828 --> 00:15:41,401
You will?

204
00:15:41,401 --> 00:15:42,933
How?

205
00:15:42,933 --> 00:15:47,893
Tonight, lend me the kitchen at Heo's Diner.

206
00:16:24,017 --> 00:16:25,984
Sir.

207
00:16:25,984 --> 00:16:28,779
Did you stay in the kitchen all night?

208
00:16:31,560 --> 00:16:36,206
Let's all focus on
today's state banquet evaluation.

209
00:16:36,206 --> 00:16:37,817
- Yes, sir!
- Yes, sir!

210
00:16:46,912 --> 00:16:50,228
You said you were looking for evidence.
So why are we at the market?

211
00:16:50,228 --> 00:16:52,661
And why do you need the kitchen?

212
00:16:54,214 --> 00:16:57,453
I know Lee Hyuk's nature all too well.

213
00:16:57,453 --> 00:17:01,279
He stops at nothing to get what he wants.

214
00:17:04,177 --> 00:17:06,826
If anything stands in his way

215
00:17:06,826 --> 00:17:09,428
he will do whatever it takes to remove it.

216
00:17:12,024 --> 00:17:13,436
- I'll take this.
- Okay.

217
00:17:13,436 --> 00:17:16,439
That'll be 5,000 won.

218
00:17:18,116 --> 00:17:20,062
Here.

219
00:17:20,062 --> 00:17:24,784
Then, is it also true
that you're returning?

220
00:17:31,440 --> 00:17:32,635
Do you have to go?

221
00:17:32,635 --> 00:17:34,511
Can't you stay?

222
00:17:36,280 --> 00:17:38,561
Let's not talk about that now.

223
00:17:40,597 --> 00:17:42,644
Don't go, mister.

224
00:17:45,457 --> 00:17:50,687
I must've made you work at the diner so much
that you're eager to leave.

225
00:17:50,687 --> 00:17:54,663
But that's just because you don't know
the sweet delights of this place!

226
00:17:55,503 --> 00:17:57,413
"Sweet delights?"

227
00:17:57,413 --> 00:18:00,177
They sound delicious.

228
00:18:06,927 --> 00:18:08,800
Come over here.

229
00:18:11,005 --> 00:18:13,211
What should we wear?

230
00:18:13,211 --> 00:18:17,381
Wait, why are we going here
instead of the diner?

231
00:18:17,381 --> 00:18:20,370
This looks nice. It's nice and hip.

232
00:18:20,370 --> 00:18:22,143
Try it on.

233
00:18:24,429 --> 00:18:26,185
Let's try this, too.

234
00:18:26,852 --> 00:18:28,214
Okay.

235
00:18:28,214 --> 00:18:31,896
I'm going with something cute.

236
00:18:34,386 --> 00:18:36,725
What do you think? Do I look cute?

237
00:18:37,449 --> 00:18:39,000
I can't see a thing.

238
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:40,338
Smile, smile, smile.

239
00:18:40,338 --> 00:18:41,656
Cheek heart! Do a cheek heart!

240
00:18:41,656 --> 00:18:44,098
Heart? What's that?

241
00:18:48,754 --> 00:18:51,205
Look at this! You look ridiculous!

242
00:18:51,205 --> 00:18:53,754
What on earth are we doing?

243
00:18:53,754 --> 00:18:55,236
I have important matters to take care of.

244
00:18:55,236 --> 00:18:56,924
Mister, look at this.

245
00:18:56,924 --> 00:18:58,521
Isn't this hilarious?

246
00:18:58,521 --> 00:19:00,907
Is this what you call a sweet delight?

247
00:19:02,012 --> 00:19:04,787
I thought it was something delicious.

248
00:19:06,495 --> 00:19:08,199
Oh, there's plenty of good food as well.

249
00:19:08,199 --> 00:19:09,835
Let's go.

250
00:19:10,775 --> 00:19:16,801
Now for the final touch,
you crack an egg right in!

251
00:19:22,269 --> 00:19:24,457
Fascinating.

252
00:19:28,745 --> 00:19:30,601
Here.

253
00:19:30,601 --> 00:19:35,021
Nothing beats a hot bowl of ramyeon
by the Han River in winter.

254
00:19:37,705 --> 00:19:40,069
It looks delicious.

255
00:19:40,069 --> 00:19:43,215
Once we finish, we should head back.

256
00:19:43,215 --> 00:19:44,583
No.

257
00:19:44,583 --> 00:19:47,827
There's still so much left to do.

258
00:19:47,827 --> 00:19:51,053
We have to go to the arcade, karaoke

259
00:19:51,053 --> 00:19:52,817
and even a ski resort!

260
00:19:52,817 --> 00:19:55,444
I don't have time for that.

261
00:19:55,444 --> 00:19:59,426
I need to return to the diner
and prepare the ingredients.

262
00:19:59,426 --> 00:20:04,110
Then hurry up and say
you won't go back to Joseon.

263
00:20:06,871 --> 00:20:08,778
I can't do that.

264
00:20:08,778 --> 00:20:11,237
Don't go.

265
00:20:13,154 --> 00:20:15,848
If you return to Joseon...

266
00:20:17,343 --> 00:20:19,224
You'll die.

267
00:20:19,224 --> 00:20:21,671
And not just die,
you'll face a horrible fate.

268
00:20:22,997 --> 00:20:24,935
I know.

269
00:20:24,935 --> 00:20:26,985
I know exactly how I die.

270
00:20:30,716 --> 00:20:33,160
I, too, have tracked down myself.

271
00:20:33,160 --> 00:20:35,242
You knew?

272
00:20:39,018 --> 00:20:42,831
Yet you're still going back?

273
00:20:42,831 --> 00:20:44,927
I have made up my mind.

274
00:20:49,544 --> 00:20:51,577
Let's eat while it's still warm.

275
00:21:02,891 --> 00:21:04,570
If you choose not to return

276
00:21:04,570 --> 00:21:08,969
you will never have to face those horrors.

277
00:21:09,770 --> 00:21:11,502
So, what will it be?

278
00:21:12,129 --> 00:21:14,899
Do you still wish to return?

279
00:21:20,179 --> 00:21:21,914
I guess.

280
00:21:21,914 --> 00:21:26,266
Living a new life under a new name…
That doesn't sound so bad, does it?

281
00:21:33,762 --> 00:21:36,053
I will return to Joseon.

282
00:21:36,053 --> 00:21:38,382
Are you hoping for a miracle?

283
00:21:40,494 --> 00:21:42,708
I will return to my friends

284
00:21:43,564 --> 00:21:45,717
to the people of Joseon

285
00:21:46,769 --> 00:21:50,499
and tell them of what I have seen,
heard, and experienced in this world.

286
00:21:52,615 --> 00:21:55,190
That there is no difference
between high and lowborns

287
00:21:55,190 --> 00:21:57,590
that those of legitimate
and illegitimate birth do not differ

288
00:21:58,550 --> 00:22:03,195
and that a world without kings
is drawing near.

289
00:22:03,195 --> 00:22:05,539
They must know.

290
00:22:07,213 --> 00:22:10,980
You truly have a knack for saying things
that will get you torn apart.

291
00:22:11,685 --> 00:22:15,367
I will choose the time and date of my return.

292
00:22:16,917 --> 00:22:21,265
There are still people here
that I must protect.

293
00:22:22,937 --> 00:22:25,783
[Heo's Diner]
[Serving meals with sincerity]

294
00:22:30,070 --> 00:22:32,616
Ta-da! Isn't it pretty?

295
00:22:34,438 --> 00:22:36,716
What is this?

296
00:22:36,716 --> 00:22:39,096
Did you change your clothes
because you're leaving?

297
00:22:39,096 --> 00:22:42,973
I simply changed into fresh clothes
for an important occasion.

298
00:22:44,407 --> 00:22:46,304
I like the embroidery, too.

299
00:22:52,594 --> 00:22:55,547
This must be one of those sweet delights.

300
00:22:55,547 --> 00:22:57,321
Are you giving this to me?

301
00:22:58,625 --> 00:23:01,845
Well… yeah.

302
00:23:01,845 --> 00:23:06,121
If I take it with me when I return,
I won't forget your face.

303
00:23:10,001 --> 00:23:12,538
I should just tie you up
so you can't leave.

304
00:23:14,062 --> 00:23:15,988
I look forward to working with you.

305
00:23:22,451 --> 00:23:25,873
Next is Jung Mi Sol.

306
00:23:25,873 --> 00:23:28,440
Jung Mi Sol?
The Jung Mi Sol we know?

307
00:23:28,440 --> 00:23:29,623
Oh, yes.

308
00:23:29,623 --> 00:23:32,684
But she informed us
that she won't be auditioning.

309
00:23:32,684 --> 00:23:34,191
I'm sorry.

310
00:23:34,191 --> 00:23:38,486
I'm not good with directions,
so I got lost for about 30 minutes out front.

311
00:23:38,486 --> 00:23:41,186
Your manager told us
that you're not auditioning.

312
00:23:42,637 --> 00:23:44,596
That was the plan.

313
00:23:44,596 --> 00:23:46,315
But I'm here.

314
00:23:48,395 --> 00:23:51,336
Is there a reason why
you changed your mind?

315
00:23:52,599 --> 00:23:56,988
I wanted to check if I had talent.

316
00:23:56,988 --> 00:23:59,774
And live without regrets.

317
00:24:19,227 --> 00:24:20,693
Please come inside.

318
00:24:33,451 --> 00:24:35,705
This is pumpkin porridge,
served as an appetizer.

319
00:24:35,705 --> 00:24:39,358
The natural sweetness of the pumpkin
will whet your appetite.

320
00:24:54,373 --> 00:24:57,444
The sweetness comes through beautifully.

321
00:25:03,701 --> 00:25:06,754
For the main course, we have eel japchae,
pine mushroom skewers, grilled galbi patties

322
00:25:06,754 --> 00:25:10,718
beef bone soup,
and a trio of seasoned vegetables.

323
00:25:40,693 --> 00:25:44,609
I can tell you've put in
a lot of effort, Chef Lee.

324
00:25:46,059 --> 00:25:47,688
But then...

325
00:25:48,409 --> 00:25:52,225
Is there something
that doesn't meet your expectations?

326
00:25:53,465 --> 00:25:57,026
No, I believe there will be good news.

327
00:25:59,385 --> 00:26:01,582
Thank you, sir.

328
00:26:10,853 --> 00:26:14,941
I am Gyosan, preparing dishes
across the street at Heo's Diner.

329
00:26:15,870 --> 00:26:18,871
Please, don't waste your time on him.

330
00:26:23,435 --> 00:26:26,021
I heard you were looking for
traditional cuisine.

331
00:26:26,021 --> 00:26:28,213
How was the food there?

332
00:26:31,547 --> 00:26:33,222
Excuse me, Gyosan.

333
00:26:33,222 --> 00:26:35,639
What are you trying to do here?

334
00:26:37,542 --> 00:26:39,846
Do you have any idea who you're talking to?

335
00:26:42,918 --> 00:26:49,628
I can confidently say that what you just ate
was nothing more than an imitation.

336
00:26:49,628 --> 00:26:50,693
What?

337
00:26:50,693 --> 00:26:52,315
I beg your pardon?

338
00:26:52,315 --> 00:26:57,194
I mean to offer you a chance to taste
real, authentic cuisine.

339
00:27:00,894 --> 00:27:07,066
Do you think the Secretary-General
would eat food made by someone like you?

340
00:27:09,233 --> 00:27:10,903
Let's try it.

341
00:27:11,555 --> 00:27:15,811
I've heard much about the restaurant
across from Dorae.

342
00:27:17,744 --> 00:27:19,653
Please come inside.

343
00:27:51,636 --> 00:27:54,822
This is bangpungjuk,
known for its rich aroma.

344
00:27:56,535 --> 00:27:59,067
I've never had porridge like this before.

345
00:28:14,705 --> 00:28:16,966
The flavor is truly unexpected.

346
00:28:17,656 --> 00:28:20,049
Wait.

347
00:28:20,049 --> 00:28:22,059
I'd like to try a bit more.

348
00:28:41,641 --> 00:28:46,824
Serving our national guests
such uninspired food would be

349
00:28:46,824 --> 00:28:49,536
disrespectful.

350
00:28:49,536 --> 00:28:53,444
Indeed, the plating does seem a bit lacking.

351
00:28:55,367 --> 00:28:57,485
This is samseok eoaltang,
a three-colored fish stew

352
00:28:57,485 --> 00:28:59,729
enjoyed by noble scholars of Andong.

353
00:28:59,729 --> 00:29:04,171
The five traditional colors in the broth
reflect the wisdom of the literati.

354
00:29:04,820 --> 00:29:06,953
What's this?

355
00:29:07,879 --> 00:29:09,666
It's japchae.

356
00:29:10,256 --> 00:29:14,124
This is japchae?

357
00:29:14,124 --> 00:29:16,465
During the reign of King...

358
00:29:16,465 --> 00:29:22,418
I mean, the reign of Gwanghae, japchae was
first introduced at a royal banquet.

359
00:29:23,651 --> 00:29:27,139
It was originally made by mixing
assorted vegetables and meat

360
00:29:27,139 --> 00:29:29,936
seasoned with doenjang,
and combined with wheat starch sauce.

361
00:29:57,423 --> 00:30:02,679
The taste is remarkable, but the story
behind it makes it even more special.

362
00:30:03,705 --> 00:30:09,614
It seems that this is exactly
the missing essence

363
00:30:09,614 --> 00:30:11,689
in Chef Lee's dishes.

364
00:30:14,124 --> 00:30:18,215
Sir, it's a little belated to say this

365
00:30:18,215 --> 00:30:21,321
but this man's identity
is completely unverified.

366
00:30:21,321 --> 00:30:26,913
How can we entrust such an important meal
to someone we know nothing about?

367
00:30:26,913 --> 00:30:28,605
Is this true?

368
00:30:29,741 --> 00:30:31,808
Then, what about you?

369
00:30:34,128 --> 00:30:37,294
Are you someone who can be trusted to cook?

370
00:30:39,760 --> 00:30:41,403
Eun Sil?

371
00:30:41,403 --> 00:30:43,254
You tried to...

372
00:30:45,417 --> 00:30:48,499
You tried to kill my mom.

373
00:30:52,252 --> 00:30:55,345
What nonsense is this?
What are you talking about?

374
00:30:55,345 --> 00:30:56,718
I know everything.

375
00:30:56,718 --> 00:31:01,321
You had Detective Kang keep an eye on her,
afraid that she might wake up.

376
00:31:04,977 --> 00:31:10,009
Chef Lee, I thought
I emphasized how important

377
00:31:10,009 --> 00:31:11,877
this state banquet is.

378
00:31:13,292 --> 00:31:15,311
It's a misunderstanding, sir.

379
00:31:15,311 --> 00:31:20,425
Whatever it is, I do not want any trouble.

380
00:31:20,425 --> 00:31:25,951
I'm afraid we can't entrust you to the job
until everything is resolved.

381
00:31:28,686 --> 00:31:30,650
What was your name again?

382
00:31:30,650 --> 00:31:32,367
I'm Heo Gyosan.

383
00:31:32,367 --> 00:31:36,015
Is it true that your identity is uncertain?

384
00:31:36,015 --> 00:31:37,798
Yes, it's true.

385
00:31:38,578 --> 00:31:40,545
That's unfortunate.

386
00:31:40,545 --> 00:31:42,416
Your dishes were exquisite.

387
00:31:47,712 --> 00:31:49,198
Sir.

388
00:31:49,198 --> 00:31:50,853
Sir!

389
00:31:53,463 --> 00:31:55,201
Young lady.

390
00:31:56,069 --> 00:31:58,511
Do not let this shake you.

391
00:31:59,523 --> 00:32:02,758
From now on,
you must face these battles alone.

392
00:32:02,758 --> 00:32:04,776
Stay strong.

393
00:32:08,844 --> 00:32:11,442
Sir, this is all a misunderstanding!

394
00:32:11,442 --> 00:32:13,805
I'm being framed, sir!

395
00:32:27,858 --> 00:32:29,085
What are you?

396
00:32:29,085 --> 00:32:31,239
How long have you been planning this?

397
00:32:31,239 --> 00:32:34,333
Since when have you been
scheming to ruin me?

398
00:32:37,791 --> 00:32:40,038
It's too early to be angry.

399
00:32:41,320 --> 00:32:42,379
What?

400
00:32:42,379 --> 00:32:44,917
Did I not tell you?

401
00:32:44,917 --> 00:32:47,917
That I'd bring undeniable evidence
you couldn't escape from.

402
00:32:54,038 --> 00:32:56,131
Don't be ridiculous.

403
00:32:56,131 --> 00:32:58,761
There is no such thing because...

404
00:32:59,879 --> 00:33:01,881
I didn't do anything.

405
00:33:04,253 --> 00:33:08,633
Well, in that case, I'll have
no choice but to... What was it called?

406
00:33:10,166 --> 00:33:11,848
The Internet!

407
00:33:12,997 --> 00:33:16,709
I suppose I'll have to post it there first.

408
00:33:20,032 --> 00:33:21,552
Wait.

409
00:33:29,003 --> 00:33:33,387
Let me see what it is.

410
00:33:40,430 --> 00:33:42,683
Not just yet…

411
00:33:44,858 --> 00:33:48,099
I'll call you when the time comes.

412
00:34:00,912 --> 00:34:04,859
Mister, I need to go see my mom.

413
00:34:05,472 --> 00:34:10,270
You're not going to disappear to Joseon
while I'm gone, right?

414
00:34:11,428 --> 00:34:16,657
Even if you must go,
you have to say goodbye before you leave.

415
00:34:16,657 --> 00:34:18,312
I understand.

416
00:34:18,312 --> 00:34:19,858
You mean that, right?

417
00:34:19,858 --> 00:34:22,143
It's a promise.

418
00:34:22,143 --> 00:34:24,089
You have my word.

419
00:34:26,799 --> 00:34:28,838
Wait, young lady.

420
00:34:49,453 --> 00:34:51,284
Take this with you.

421
00:34:52,144 --> 00:34:53,662
What's this?

422
00:34:53,662 --> 00:34:56,174
This is the evidence
of your mother's accident.

423
00:34:57,221 --> 00:34:59,379
Come on, how can this be?

424
00:35:01,678 --> 00:35:03,781
Keep it safe.

425
00:35:22,146 --> 00:35:24,505
What on earth is this?

426
00:35:59,826 --> 00:36:02,154
Now's the time.

427
00:36:02,154 --> 00:36:05,576
Come to the place I tell you.

428
00:36:22,711 --> 00:36:26,279
From that end

429
00:36:26,279 --> 00:36:28,304
to the other…

430
00:36:28,906 --> 00:36:31,876
This will be Dorae Theme Village.

431
00:36:32,900 --> 00:36:37,646
And right in the center is your diner.

432
00:36:51,224 --> 00:36:54,086
Our diner just happens to be
right in the middle...

433
00:36:55,106 --> 00:36:56,834
Yes.

434
00:36:56,834 --> 00:37:02,727
As you can see, if your diner remains

435
00:37:02,727 --> 00:37:07,237
my entire plan will fall apart.

436
00:37:08,313 --> 00:37:11,385
I understand your situation

437
00:37:11,385 --> 00:37:14,978
but I have my reasons
for wanting to hold on to my diner.

438
00:37:15,832 --> 00:37:18,520
That diner may be old and shabby

439
00:37:18,520 --> 00:37:21,314
but it's a legacy
handed down for generations.

440
00:37:23,290 --> 00:37:29,082
Generations ago, my great-grandfather
opened a tavern right there.

441
00:37:29,082 --> 00:37:34,370
And it has been passed down ever since.

442
00:37:47,065 --> 00:37:49,113
Chef Lee.

443
00:37:49,113 --> 00:37:51,073
Are you listening?

444
00:38:18,697 --> 00:38:20,343
You're here.

445
00:38:27,330 --> 00:38:31,531
You look like you haven't slept a wink
out of sheer anxiety.

446
00:38:31,531 --> 00:38:36,174
Cut the nonsense
and show me the evidence.

447
00:38:38,552 --> 00:38:40,514
Is this the place?

448
00:38:41,209 --> 00:38:44,013
Where you pushed Eun Sil's mother.

449
00:38:45,689 --> 00:38:48,122
The madam fell all the way down there

450
00:38:48,122 --> 00:38:50,444
and I was rushing over from this side.

451
00:38:50,444 --> 00:38:54,164
Enough with the talking,
just show me that so-called evidence.

452
00:38:54,164 --> 00:38:56,083
Right now!

453
00:38:58,088 --> 00:39:00,816
The time should be just about right.

454
00:39:13,599 --> 00:39:16,720
I heard this sound

455
00:39:17,308 --> 00:39:22,354
and while I ran off to find help,
you fled the scene.

456
00:39:22,982 --> 00:39:26,107
And I have it all recorded.

457
00:39:30,465 --> 00:39:34,634
There's no surveillance camera here.

458
00:39:35,977 --> 00:39:39,707
Then what do you suppose this is?

459
00:39:43,330 --> 00:39:44,826
Give it to me.

460
00:39:46,372 --> 00:39:48,908
If you did nothing wrong

461
00:39:49,498 --> 00:39:51,736
there's no reason to be this desperate.

462
00:39:51,736 --> 00:39:52,915
Hand it over!

463
00:39:52,915 --> 00:39:55,613
Hold it! What do you think you're doing?

464
00:39:55,613 --> 00:39:57,330
Step aside!

465
00:40:08,908 --> 00:40:11,178
What's this sound?

466
00:40:11,178 --> 00:40:14,754
Pay the price for harming the madam.

467
00:40:19,167 --> 00:40:21,903
I do not want any trouble.

468
00:40:21,903 --> 00:40:26,898
I'm afraid we can't entrust you to the job
until everything is resolved.

469
00:41:29,609 --> 00:41:31,240
This is...

470
00:41:35,252 --> 00:41:36,934
Old man!

471
00:41:38,961 --> 00:41:40,962
Old man, are you there?

472
00:41:55,312 --> 00:41:57,542
May I ask something?

473
00:41:57,542 --> 00:42:01,682
Is this the right way to Yukjo Street?

474
00:42:01,682 --> 00:42:03,346
That's right.

475
00:42:16,905 --> 00:42:18,858
Well, this is a disaster.

476
00:42:26,206 --> 00:42:27,540
What brings you here?

477
00:42:27,540 --> 00:42:29,657
I've come to see His Excellency.

478
00:42:29,657 --> 00:42:32,442
He has yet to wake.

479
00:42:32,442 --> 00:42:33,694
Your Excellency!

480
00:42:33,694 --> 00:42:35,546
Your Excellency!

481
00:42:41,533 --> 00:42:44,370
What is all this commotion so early?

482
00:42:44,370 --> 00:42:48,149
Forgive me, but there is an urgent matter.

483
00:42:53,842 --> 00:42:55,618
What is it?

484
00:42:57,944 --> 00:43:03,613
There are reports of a man without a topknot
roaming within the Four Gates.

485
00:43:03,613 --> 00:43:05,569
What?

486
00:43:05,569 --> 00:43:07,681
Could it be…

487
00:43:09,587 --> 00:43:11,979
Are you saying Gyosan is here?

488
00:43:11,979 --> 00:43:15,997
Based on the description,
it seems to be him.

489
00:43:15,997 --> 00:43:20,994
You swore he was struck down,
a blade through his throat!

490
00:43:20,994 --> 00:43:23,303
I cannot explain it myself.

491
00:43:25,065 --> 00:43:28,849
Seize him at once and bring him before me!

492
00:43:28,849 --> 00:43:30,949
Yes, Your Excellency.

493
00:43:30,949 --> 00:43:33,023
There is no need

494
00:43:33,023 --> 00:43:35,289
to bring him back alive.

495
00:43:48,929 --> 00:43:51,574
They say he ran away, ran away.

496
00:43:52,244 --> 00:43:54,652
I'm almost at Yukjo Street.

497
00:43:54,652 --> 00:43:56,751
I'm almost there.

498
00:44:02,147 --> 00:44:04,187
Wait.

499
00:44:04,187 --> 00:44:06,816
I made a promise to the old man.

500
00:44:12,999 --> 00:44:15,776
But saving my friends comes first.

501
00:44:21,093 --> 00:44:23,008
However...

502
00:44:53,424 --> 00:44:56,096
This should be the right place.

503
00:44:59,091 --> 00:45:00,921
That must be her.

504
00:45:03,381 --> 00:45:05,705
- Excuse me.
- Huh?

505
00:45:05,705 --> 00:45:08,279
Oh my, who might you be?

506
00:45:08,279 --> 00:45:12,931
Just a passing traveler.
I have a message to deliver to you.

507
00:45:12,931 --> 00:45:15,289
To me?

508
00:45:15,289 --> 00:45:17,867
What is it?

509
00:45:17,867 --> 00:45:22,349
Your father, who built this tavern, asked me
to deliver a message to his daughter.

510
00:45:24,105 --> 00:45:25,639
Oh, well then...

511
00:45:25,639 --> 00:45:29,577
I only work here.

512
00:45:29,577 --> 00:45:33,286
The daughter is over there.

513
00:45:37,504 --> 00:45:39,228
Thank you.

514
00:45:45,415 --> 00:45:47,378
What a waste.

515
00:45:50,050 --> 00:45:52,019
But then...

516
00:45:52,019 --> 00:45:55,982
He looks awfully familiar.

517
00:46:02,096 --> 00:46:03,986
Are you the owner of this place?

518
00:46:06,706 --> 00:46:09,816
I bring a message from your father.

519
00:46:10,585 --> 00:46:13,432
My father passed away last year

520
00:46:13,432 --> 00:46:16,091
so how could he have sent you?

521
00:46:17,139 --> 00:46:18,826
He told me

522
00:46:18,826 --> 00:46:22,136
there was something
he never got to say to his daughter.

523
00:46:26,994 --> 00:46:33,160
Pass this tavern down
not by son or daughter

524
00:46:33,160 --> 00:46:38,509
but to the child with the kindest heart,
the one most deserving.

525
00:46:39,590 --> 00:46:46,597
Let it remain a place of warmth
and generosity for generations to come.

526
00:46:46,597 --> 00:46:48,214
And I...

527
00:46:48,214 --> 00:46:51,798
I shall watch over it even in death.

528
00:46:56,719 --> 00:47:01,013
And as for your mother's ring…

529
00:47:06,995 --> 00:47:08,787
Dad.

530
00:47:13,993 --> 00:47:15,906
Dad!

531
00:47:20,822 --> 00:47:23,551
How could a mere traveler

532
00:47:23,551 --> 00:47:25,934
possibly know that?

533
00:47:46,081 --> 00:47:47,777
Young lady!

534
00:47:49,420 --> 00:47:50,583
I knew it.

535
00:47:50,583 --> 00:47:53,628
If you're trying to pull a trick, get lost!

536
00:48:06,996 --> 00:48:08,076
I see now.

537
00:48:08,076 --> 00:48:10,521
This place will one day become Seonbuk-dong

538
00:48:10,521 --> 00:48:13,597
and this very tavern will
turn into the diner.

539
00:48:15,191 --> 00:48:17,636
Do you need a bucket of water on your head
to make you leave?

540
00:48:17,636 --> 00:48:19,565
According to your father

541
00:48:20,291 --> 00:48:24,543
your late mother's ring wasn't lost to gambling…

542
00:48:24,543 --> 00:48:27,396
Every time I looked at it,
I wanted to follow her to the afterlife.

543
00:48:27,396 --> 00:48:29,947
So I hid it inside the seed soy sauce jar.

544
00:48:29,947 --> 00:48:32,008
Please tell her that.

545
00:48:44,735 --> 00:48:48,251
Could it really be true?

546
00:48:48,251 --> 00:48:51,931
You're just as doubtful as Lady Eun Sil.

547
00:48:51,931 --> 00:48:56,727
His smooth face resembles the man
on the wanted notice!

548
00:48:56,727 --> 00:48:59,575
Hurry over!

549
00:49:02,859 --> 00:49:05,228
Are the royal guards after you?

550
00:49:07,233 --> 00:49:08,616
It seems so.

551
00:49:08,616 --> 00:49:10,536
Hurry, this way!

552
00:49:14,483 --> 00:49:17,636
Do not come out until I tell you.

553
00:49:29,539 --> 00:49:31,508
Mister!

554
00:49:32,982 --> 00:49:34,539
Mister!

555
00:49:35,582 --> 00:49:37,578
Mister!

556
00:49:43,109 --> 00:49:44,896
No...

557
00:49:52,302 --> 00:49:56,098
The number you have dialed is turned off
Please leave a message after the beep.

558
00:49:56,098 --> 00:49:59,870
Why isn't he picking up?

559
00:50:01,570 --> 00:50:03,497
Excuse me.

560
00:50:03,497 --> 00:50:05,226
I'm here for the demolition estimate.

561
00:50:05,226 --> 00:50:09,286
Can I check the kitchen
for the gas and water lines?

562
00:50:10,285 --> 00:50:12,456
Wait a second.

563
00:50:13,227 --> 00:50:14,575
What are you doing in my diner?

564
00:50:14,575 --> 00:50:16,329
It's now...

565
00:50:17,077 --> 00:50:19,222
My diner.

566
00:50:20,610 --> 00:50:22,664
Please continue.

567
00:50:25,774 --> 00:50:29,268
The contract has yet to be concluded.
Don't you think you're overstepping?

568
00:50:29,268 --> 00:50:31,648
This eyesore needs to be torn down

569
00:50:32,351 --> 00:50:37,310
to make room for something better.

570
00:50:39,042 --> 00:50:42,228
You really do wipe out
anything in your way, don't you?

571
00:50:42,895 --> 00:50:45,889
Just like how you put my mom in a coma.

572
00:50:45,889 --> 00:50:48,627
Stop being stubborn

573
00:50:48,627 --> 00:50:51,439
and go live somewhere nice.

574
00:50:51,439 --> 00:50:57,020
You can't run this place on your own anyway.

575
00:50:57,020 --> 00:51:02,360
You talk like Mr. Homeless is gone for good.

576
00:51:05,332 --> 00:51:06,984
What do you mean?

577
00:51:06,984 --> 00:51:09,116
You met with him, didn't you?

578
00:51:09,948 --> 00:51:12,703
Where is he right now?

579
00:51:12,703 --> 00:51:16,243
Why ask me that?

580
00:51:19,837 --> 00:51:22,364
You didn't do something to him, did you?

581
00:51:23,036 --> 00:51:25,017
I'm done here.

582
00:51:27,765 --> 00:51:29,803
Yes, let's go.

583
00:51:44,902 --> 00:51:48,860
Detective Kang, it's me, Bong Eun Sil.

584
00:51:48,860 --> 00:51:50,318
Yes, Bong Eun Sil.

585
00:51:50,318 --> 00:51:52,251
Daddy!

586
00:51:55,390 --> 00:51:57,720
Lee Hyuk again?

587
00:52:01,028 --> 00:52:03,661
Well, I understand your situation

588
00:52:03,661 --> 00:52:05,814
but I'm not a cop anymore.

589
00:52:05,814 --> 00:52:08,483
You should report it in person.

590
00:52:10,793 --> 00:52:13,757
Oh yeah, he was unidentified.

591
00:52:15,937 --> 00:52:20,493
All right, I'll see what I can do.

592
00:52:20,493 --> 00:52:22,925
Thank you, detective.

593
00:52:22,925 --> 00:52:24,810
Please help me with this.

594
00:52:57,890 --> 00:53:01,375
Wasn't this what was in the jar?

595
00:53:10,056 --> 00:53:11,127
Yes, detective

596
00:53:11,127 --> 00:53:13,058
I looked into it

597
00:53:13,058 --> 00:53:16,342
and it turns out his phone's last signal
before shutting off

598
00:53:16,342 --> 00:53:18,965
was detected near that area.

599
00:53:26,931 --> 00:53:29,342
Mister!

600
00:53:29,342 --> 00:53:31,577
Mr. Homeless!

601
00:53:32,329 --> 00:53:33,822
Who are you looking for?

602
00:53:33,822 --> 00:53:35,413
Mister!

603
00:53:39,073 --> 00:53:41,548
Where is he?

604
00:53:43,185 --> 00:53:44,308
Come on out.

605
00:53:44,308 --> 00:53:45,859
- Haven't you seen Mr. Homeless?
- You need to leave.

606
00:53:45,859 --> 00:53:47,390
Wait, let go of me.

607
00:53:47,390 --> 00:53:49,811
I said, haven't you seen Mr. Homeless?

608
00:53:50,616 --> 00:53:53,392
Haven't you seen Mr. Homeless?

609
00:53:53,392 --> 00:53:55,764
We really haven't seen him.

610
00:54:04,833 --> 00:54:07,255
Did something really happen to him?

611
00:54:07,928 --> 00:54:11,322
Did he return?

612
00:54:26,130 --> 00:54:28,250
Wait, young lady.

613
00:54:28,250 --> 00:54:30,114
Take this with you.

614
00:54:31,013 --> 00:54:32,562
What is it?

615
00:54:32,562 --> 00:54:34,880
This is the evidence
of your mother's accident.

616
00:54:56,463 --> 00:54:59,312
It should be somewhere around here.

617
00:55:00,293 --> 00:55:02,714
Why did he have to draw the map like this?

618
00:55:02,714 --> 00:55:05,039
How am I supposed to find this?

619
00:55:20,695 --> 00:55:22,692
This was recorded at dawn.

620
00:55:23,830 --> 00:55:26,854
He filmed a video for over three hours.

621
00:55:28,639 --> 00:55:31,114
No wonder the battery is out.

622
00:55:55,420 --> 00:55:57,407
Lee Hyuk…

623
00:55:57,407 --> 00:56:00,157
So, he did meet Mr. Homeless.

624
00:56:03,336 --> 00:56:05,184
Is this the place?

625
00:56:05,887 --> 00:56:08,688
Where you pushed Eun Sil's mother?

626
00:56:10,678 --> 00:56:11,849
Give it to me.

627
00:56:11,849 --> 00:56:15,023
If you did nothing wrong

628
00:56:15,023 --> 00:56:17,219
there's no reason to be this desperate.

629
00:56:17,219 --> 00:56:18,513
Hand it over!

630
00:56:18,513 --> 00:56:19,858
Hold it!

631
00:56:27,094 --> 00:56:28,858
You can come out now.

632
00:56:32,219 --> 00:56:34,580
The guards might return

633
00:56:34,580 --> 00:56:37,544
so you should leave quickly.

634
00:56:40,486 --> 00:56:43,214
You'll be caught if you go out like that.

635
00:56:43,214 --> 00:56:44,890
Here, take this.

636
00:56:46,075 --> 00:56:49,075
Why are you helping me?

637
00:56:49,075 --> 00:56:52,323
For all you know,
I could be a dangerous criminal.

638
00:56:52,323 --> 00:56:54,515
I don't know about that.

639
00:56:55,240 --> 00:56:57,770
But you delivered
my father's final words to me

640
00:56:57,770 --> 00:57:01,103
and found my mother's ring...

641
00:57:01,103 --> 00:57:03,811
I can't just stand by
and let you be captured.

642
00:57:04,573 --> 00:57:07,129
You really are just like her.

643
00:57:07,129 --> 00:57:10,211
Who are you talking about?

644
00:57:11,424 --> 00:57:13,557
Someone I know.

645
00:57:14,874 --> 00:57:19,084
She's full of doubt and very nosy.

646
00:57:24,666 --> 00:57:27,300
I have a favor to ask.

647
00:57:35,698 --> 00:57:37,566
Gyosan.

648
00:57:38,344 --> 00:57:41,404
Where have you been hiding all along?

649
00:57:43,498 --> 00:57:47,223
He's unpredictable,
which makes him even more dangerous.

650
00:57:52,597 --> 00:57:55,047
And yet, still no sign of him?

651
00:57:55,047 --> 00:57:57,068
My apologies, Your Excellency.

652
00:57:58,982 --> 00:58:00,760
Shall I release more men?

653
00:58:00,760 --> 00:58:02,960
That's unnecessary.

654
00:58:02,960 --> 00:58:05,735
His goal is clear.

655
00:58:05,735 --> 00:58:08,588
So all we've to do is to ruin it.

656
00:58:09,946 --> 00:58:12,892
We must hasten the execution
of the illegitimate sons.

657
00:58:12,892 --> 00:58:14,694
To when?

658
00:58:17,144 --> 00:58:18,783
Immediately.

659
00:58:19,552 --> 00:58:21,183
Yes, Your Excellency.

660
00:58:29,882 --> 00:58:33,121
So they're finally executing the traitors?

661
00:58:33,121 --> 00:58:35,068
- It's happening today.
- The whole town is in chaos.

662
00:58:35,068 --> 00:58:37,289
Why has the market been so restless lately?

663
00:58:37,289 --> 00:58:38,418
I don't know.

664
00:58:38,418 --> 00:58:39,977
But they say they'll wipe them all out.

665
00:58:39,977 --> 00:58:43,478
People are talking about it non-stop.

666
00:58:43,478 --> 00:58:45,450
It's a mess.

667
00:58:46,505 --> 00:58:48,818
Excuse me, what...

668
00:58:51,417 --> 00:58:53,151
What is going on?

669
00:58:53,151 --> 00:58:58,482
The Administration of Inspections is
executing the illegitimate traitors today.

670
00:58:58,482 --> 00:59:00,399
What did you just say?

671
00:59:00,399 --> 00:59:02,479
But today isn't the new moon!

672
00:59:07,108 --> 00:59:08,408
That man...!

673
00:59:08,408 --> 00:59:12,047
That's the traitor on the wanted notice!

674
00:59:17,444 --> 00:59:19,222
Lord Gyosan.

675
00:59:23,217 --> 00:59:26,875
Have you seen this man?

676
00:59:27,527 --> 00:59:30,738
He's said to be in the area,
so report immediately if you find him.

677
00:59:47,897 --> 00:59:49,639
My Lord!

678
00:59:51,507 --> 00:59:52,766
My Lord!

679
00:59:52,766 --> 00:59:53,840
Mae Chang.

680
00:59:53,840 --> 00:59:57,528
There's no time to waste,
they are at the Administration of Inspections.

681
00:59:58,382 --> 01:00:01,435
Leave this to me and go now!

682
01:00:03,098 --> 01:00:04,387
Seize him!

683
01:00:04,387 --> 01:00:05,961
- Seize him!
- Seize him!

684
01:00:05,961 --> 01:00:09,583
Seize him!

685
01:00:09,583 --> 01:00:12,235
Seize him now!

686
01:00:20,142 --> 01:00:22,731
Thank you, Mae Chang.

687
01:00:43,872 --> 01:00:45,649
Excuse me.

688
01:00:58,083 --> 01:01:01,218
If you clear the way, I'll give you this.

689
01:01:04,762 --> 01:01:06,491
I'll give you 15 minutes.

690
01:01:15,221 --> 01:01:17,185
My friend.

691
01:01:17,185 --> 01:01:19,506
Gyosan...

692
01:01:20,983 --> 01:01:23,355
I thought you were dead.

693
01:01:23,355 --> 01:01:26,894
I never imagined we'd meet again,
not in this world, but in the afterlife.

694
01:01:26,894 --> 01:01:31,524
I have not been in the afterlife
but in the future.

695
01:01:31,524 --> 01:01:33,316
The future?

696
01:01:33,316 --> 01:01:36,958
I came back to clear your names

697
01:01:36,958 --> 01:01:39,658
and stop this execution.

698
01:01:39,658 --> 01:01:44,182
But unfortunately,
I do not have the power to do that.

699
01:01:46,900 --> 01:01:51,665
Forgive this useless friend of yours.

700
01:01:56,674 --> 01:01:59,470
Do not say such things.

701
01:02:00,970 --> 01:02:05,485
Even when our own families cast us aside

702
01:02:06,142 --> 01:02:11,254
you stood by us as a true friend.

703
01:02:11,876 --> 01:02:14,639
I don't know if this will bring you
any comfort.

704
01:02:15,702 --> 01:02:18,499
But the future I saw

705
01:02:19,092 --> 01:02:22,522
had neither legitimate nor illegitimate births.

706
01:02:22,522 --> 01:02:25,005
It's free of high and lowborns.

707
01:02:25,005 --> 01:02:29,264
People could become whatever they wished

708
01:02:29,264 --> 01:02:31,502
regardless of their birth.

709
01:02:32,862 --> 01:02:34,730
You...

710
01:02:35,546 --> 01:02:40,396
You mean you went to
such a wondrous place alone?

711
01:02:43,182 --> 01:02:45,194
In the next life…

712
01:02:48,419 --> 01:02:50,549
In the next life, we will…

713
01:02:56,634 --> 01:02:58,996
Wait, that's...

714
01:02:58,996 --> 01:03:02,763
Isn't that Gyosan,
whom His Highness cherishes?

715
01:03:02,763 --> 01:03:05,472
It seems to be...

716
01:03:05,472 --> 01:03:07,767
But what happened to his hair?

717
01:03:12,964 --> 01:03:14,956
Gyosan!

718
01:03:18,821 --> 01:03:21,524
Do you have any idea how much I worried

719
01:03:21,524 --> 01:03:23,402
about you?

720
01:03:25,701 --> 01:03:28,784
I'm relieved to see you safe.

721
01:03:32,974 --> 01:03:35,182
Don't be reckless.

722
01:03:35,182 --> 01:03:40,368
You're not foolish enough to act in vain.

723
01:03:54,333 --> 01:03:57,240
Where have you been hiding all this time?

724
01:03:58,674 --> 01:04:01,382
Who helped you disappear

725
01:04:01,382 --> 01:04:03,551
without a trace?

726
01:04:03,551 --> 01:04:08,897
I was never in hiding. I was traveling.

727
01:04:10,218 --> 01:04:12,173
Traveling where?

728
01:04:13,383 --> 01:04:16,318
It was a place where
houses towered higher than mountains.

729
01:04:16,318 --> 01:04:18,812
Carriages were swifter than horses.

730
01:04:19,403 --> 01:04:22,476
And the day was bright as night.

731
01:04:24,579 --> 01:04:26,424
Unbelievable.

732
01:04:27,268 --> 01:04:30,289
Still wasting time with your fantasies.

733
01:04:31,579 --> 01:04:37,739
Haven't I told you before?
It's all pointless.

734
01:04:39,058 --> 01:04:41,651
This is no fantasy.

735
01:04:41,651 --> 01:04:45,218
I returned without a single wound

736
01:04:45,218 --> 01:04:49,154
after being stabbed by an assassin you sent.

737
01:04:50,375 --> 01:04:52,885
That itself is proof.

738
01:05:00,191 --> 01:05:05,010
Our entire lives, yours and mine,
were recorded in mere lines.

739
01:05:06,060 --> 01:05:11,589
When we were born, what we did,
and how we would die.

740
01:05:15,308 --> 01:05:19,049
Don't look away and watch carefully.

741
01:05:20,024 --> 01:05:23,513
Soon enough, you will take their place.

742
01:05:24,789 --> 01:05:26,541
What?

743
01:05:28,002 --> 01:05:31,074
Lee Yi Chum, the one who ruled with tyranny

744
01:05:31,074 --> 01:05:33,293
was overthrown by anti-government forces.

745
01:05:33,293 --> 01:05:36,372
While fleeing to a different province

746
01:05:37,438 --> 01:05:39,863
he was captured and beheaded.

747
01:05:42,184 --> 01:05:44,752
That was your record.

748
01:05:47,125 --> 01:05:49,093
How dare you!

749
01:06:37,128 --> 01:06:39,659
Everything has been taken care of.

750
01:06:39,659 --> 01:06:44,611
I sincerely apologize for the trouble, sir.

751
01:06:44,611 --> 01:06:46,883
Can I trust that it's truly resolved?

752
01:06:48,316 --> 01:06:54,265
In business, you sometimes attract
unwanted attention.

753
01:06:58,938 --> 01:07:01,089
Excuse us.

754
01:07:01,751 --> 01:07:05,009
We're from Seonbuk Police Station.
Are you Lee Hyuk?

755
01:07:05,989 --> 01:07:08,649
We need you to come with us.

756
01:07:14,547 --> 01:07:16,782
Why would I need to go
to the police station?

757
01:07:16,782 --> 01:07:22,823
We received a report with a video
showing you pushing a man down the stairs.

758
01:07:24,933 --> 01:07:26,037
Sir.

759
01:07:26,037 --> 01:07:27,522
Sir, this is a misunderstanding!

760
01:07:27,522 --> 01:07:28,566
Sir.

761
01:07:28,566 --> 01:07:30,351
Sir, this is a misunderstanding!

762
01:07:30,351 --> 01:07:32,235
Sir!

763
01:07:41,223 --> 01:07:43,604
- There he is!
- It's Chef Lee!

764
01:07:45,661 --> 01:07:48,038
Are you the man in the video?

765
01:07:48,038 --> 01:07:49,191
What happened to the victim?

766
01:07:49,191 --> 01:07:51,468
Did you intend to kill him?

767
01:07:51,468 --> 01:07:54,542
How can there be a case
where no victim exists?

768
01:07:54,542 --> 01:07:56,731
This entire situation is absurd.

769
01:07:56,731 --> 01:07:58,752
This is nothing but speculation.

770
01:07:58,752 --> 01:08:00,614
I will cooperate with the investigation
and clear my name.

771
01:08:00,614 --> 01:08:01,868
Was it spontaneous?

772
01:08:01,868 --> 01:08:03,232
Or was it premeditated?

773
01:08:03,232 --> 01:08:04,631
Please say something.

774
01:08:04,631 --> 01:08:07,087
Just one statement!

775
01:08:07,087 --> 01:08:09,001
A comment, please!

776
01:08:09,001 --> 01:08:10,411
Where did you get this umbrella?

777
01:08:10,411 --> 01:08:14,031
I swear I got rid of it!
Where did you get it?

778
01:08:16,269 --> 01:08:17,958
What umbrella?

779
01:08:25,309 --> 01:08:27,095
Is the conversation in the video real?

780
01:08:27,095 --> 01:08:29,555
Please say something!

781
01:08:32,947 --> 01:08:34,611
Mi Sol.

782
01:08:35,322 --> 01:08:38,068
Our movie is making headlines,
eight articles already!

783
01:08:38,068 --> 01:08:39,520
Let me see.

784
01:08:42,354 --> 01:08:44,022
Why did they use this photo?

785
01:08:44,022 --> 01:08:45,644
Is the journalist my hater?

786
01:08:45,644 --> 01:08:47,107
You look great.

787
01:08:47,107 --> 01:08:48,258
Come on.

788
01:08:48,258 --> 01:08:52,464
Anyway, do you think you'll be able to handle
the emotional scene this time?

789
01:08:52,464 --> 01:08:55,504
[Chef Lee Hyuk Sentenced to 8 Years
for Attempted Murder]

790
01:08:55,504 --> 01:08:57,069
Whoa, no way!

791
01:08:57,069 --> 01:08:58,907
Lee Hyuk must've caused trouble!

792
01:08:58,907 --> 01:09:01,696
I knew he'd get caught someday.

793
01:09:01,696 --> 01:09:04,709
Hey, focus! You need to
stay composed for your scene.

794
01:09:04,709 --> 01:09:07,855
Okay, okay.

795
01:09:07,855 --> 01:09:09,542
These comments are pure gold.

796
01:09:09,542 --> 01:09:12,151
Everyone's just tearing him apart.

797
01:09:13,868 --> 01:09:14,951
Oh, what's this?

798
01:09:14,951 --> 01:09:16,885
Looks like there's even a video clip.

799
01:09:16,885 --> 01:09:18,662
Jung Mi Sol, we're ready for you.

800
01:09:18,662 --> 01:09:20,273
Yes, we're coming.

801
01:09:20,273 --> 01:09:22,795
Mi Sol, put your phone away, and let's go.

802
01:09:37,277 --> 01:09:39,151
Why are you acting like this?

803
01:09:39,151 --> 01:09:43,093
It really feels like
I'm the only one in love these days.

804
01:09:43,093 --> 01:09:47,765
You're always the one who's late,
but I'm always the one worrying.

805
01:09:59,412 --> 01:10:02,088
She's not supposed to cry here...

806
01:10:02,088 --> 01:10:03,783
Leave her alone.

807
01:10:20,312 --> 01:10:24,301
I wanted Mr. Homeless to stay.

808
01:10:24,301 --> 01:10:28,061
But perhaps it's for the best
that he returned safely.

809
01:10:28,722 --> 01:10:30,301
Still...

810
01:10:31,086 --> 01:10:34,440
I wish I could have seen him one last time.

811
01:10:38,025 --> 01:10:40,512
I don't know what's better.

812
01:11:15,523 --> 01:11:19,288
Please pass this embroidery down for generations.

813
01:11:19,288 --> 01:11:21,412
It's a treasured piece.

814
01:11:24,982 --> 01:11:28,342
He must have returned safely.

815
01:11:29,117 --> 01:11:32,310
He said he wouldn't leave
without saying goodbye.

816
01:11:33,505 --> 01:11:35,797
He's such a liar.

817
01:12:03,135 --> 01:12:06,710
Mom, do you recognize me?

818
01:12:16,888 --> 01:12:19,992
Mom, do you really recognize me?

819
01:12:25,142 --> 01:12:27,266
Doctor!

820
01:12:28,457 --> 01:12:31,767
Mom quickly recovered
after regaining consciousness...

821
01:12:31,767 --> 01:12:34,840
which led to the dismissal
of my guardianship hearing.

822
01:12:34,840 --> 01:12:36,274
[A year later]

823
01:12:36,274 --> 01:12:39,950
Naturally, the contract for Heo's Diner was voided.

824
01:12:39,950 --> 01:12:41,284
Enjoy.

825
01:12:41,284 --> 01:12:43,199
[Due to health reasons,
only 50 servings are available per day]

826
01:12:43,199 --> 01:12:45,368
Enjoy.

827
01:12:45,368 --> 01:12:46,641
Have you seen this?

828
01:12:46,641 --> 01:12:48,507
He tried to kill the owner of this diner.

829
01:12:48,507 --> 01:12:51,348
- Seriously?
- Yeah.

830
01:12:52,782 --> 01:12:54,796
Lee Hyuk, who coveted Heo's Diner

831
01:12:54,796 --> 01:12:58,681
was acquitted due to insufficient evidence
regarding Mr. Homeless.

832
01:12:58,681 --> 01:13:01,657
However, he was convicted
for attempting to murder Mom.

833
01:13:03,611 --> 01:13:06,376
- Take care.
- Thank you, we enjoyed the meal.

834
01:13:18,204 --> 01:13:20,864
Eun Sil, I'm here.

835
01:13:20,864 --> 01:13:22,346
Hey, Mi Sol.

836
01:13:22,346 --> 01:13:24,660
You've been ordering to-go a lot these days
You must be busy.

837
01:13:24,660 --> 01:13:26,934
My schedule is absolutely hectic.

838
01:13:26,934 --> 01:13:31,224
You won't see me much from now on
so take a good look while you can.

839
01:13:31,224 --> 01:13:32,858
All right.

840
01:13:32,858 --> 01:13:35,454
- Mom, to-go!
- Yes, I'm all done.

841
01:13:37,333 --> 01:13:38,989
- Here you go.
- Thank you.

842
01:13:38,989 --> 01:13:40,430
I'll carry it for you.

843
01:13:40,430 --> 01:13:41,804
Since you're our VVIP.

844
01:13:41,804 --> 01:13:44,556
Forget it, my car is right outside.

845
01:13:44,556 --> 01:13:45,920
Thank you for the meal, ma'am.

846
01:13:45,920 --> 01:13:47,359
Enjoy!

847
01:13:47,359 --> 01:13:49,034
Take care.

848
01:13:52,415 --> 01:13:54,749
That makes 50, including Mi Sol's order.

849
01:13:54,749 --> 01:13:56,655
We're sold out for the day!

850
01:13:57,866 --> 01:14:01,477
Ma'am, your spinach is here.

851
01:14:01,477 --> 01:14:03,671
Enough for three days!

852
01:14:03,671 --> 01:14:04,770
They're fresh, right?

853
01:14:04,770 --> 01:14:06,353
Of course.

854
01:14:06,353 --> 01:14:09,192
I only deliver the best to Heo's Diner.

855
01:14:09,192 --> 01:14:11,665
Eun Sil, what are you doing?
Go get Mr. Kang some coffee.

856
01:14:11,665 --> 01:14:14,899
- Oh, coffee!
- No, no! I quit coffee!

857
01:14:14,899 --> 01:14:17,450
I'm behind on deliveries. See you next week!

858
01:14:17,450 --> 01:14:19,449
Drive safely!

859
01:14:21,108 --> 01:14:23,394
Detective Kang's business
must be doing well.

860
01:14:23,394 --> 01:14:25,283
I guess so.

861
01:14:37,060 --> 01:14:40,064
- Thank you, take care.
- Thank you for the meal.

862
01:14:40,064 --> 01:14:41,202
Thank you for the meal.

863
01:14:41,202 --> 01:14:43,343
Take care.

864
01:14:56,417 --> 01:14:59,442
It wasn't until long after Mr. Homeless left

865
01:14:59,442 --> 01:15:03,733
that I realized he had already said goodbye.

866
01:15:06,158 --> 01:15:08,272
Lady Eun Sil.

867
01:15:08,272 --> 01:15:12,368
Please forgive me for bidding farewell in writing.

868
01:15:14,782 --> 01:15:19,253
Living in this world and the other,
I came to understand...

869
01:15:22,705 --> 01:15:28,606
that whether in the past or the future,
one can only live in the present.

870
01:15:29,252 --> 01:15:33,595
So do your best to be happy.

871
01:15:39,719 --> 01:15:41,963
Happiness is self-service.

872
01:15:44,397 --> 01:15:47,210
- We're closed today.
- Welcome.

873
01:15:48,956 --> 01:15:52,088
- Mom.
- Don't complain and take the order.

874
01:15:55,729 --> 01:15:57,561
Would you like a set meal?

875
01:15:57,561 --> 01:15:59,211
Yes, please.
