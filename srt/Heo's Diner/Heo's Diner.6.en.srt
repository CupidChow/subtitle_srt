Yes, I think so.

00:01:01,925 --> 00:01:03,518

Jung Mi Sol, I know you're awake.

29

That's it, I'm calling the police.

00:02:25,702 --> 00:02:27,316
Oh, don't!

31
00:02:28,563 --> 00:02:31,178

32

Thank goodness you regained consciousness.

33
00:02:33,302 --> 00:02:36,606
Didn't I hit you with my car earlier?

34
00:02:37,202 --> 00:02:39,445
As you can see, I'm perfectly fine.

35
00:02:39,445 --> 00:02:41,235
No one got hurt.

36
00:02:41,235 --> 00:02:44,073
Still, why would you do
something like that?

37
00:02:44,073 --> 00:02:46,370
That was way too dangerous.

38
00:02:46,370 --> 00:02:48,887
I have to ask, did you drink?

39
00:02:48,887 --> 00:02:52,394
You're already caught up in enough scandals.

40
00:02:52,394 --> 00:02:54,520
Are you really adding drunk driving to the list?

41
00:02:54,520 --> 00:02:55,925
What?

42
00:02:55,925 --> 00:02:58,427
I didn't drink a single drop!

43
00:03:00,202 --> 00:03:03,788
Lee Hyuk was my target.
You two just got in the way.

44
00:03:03,788 --> 00:03:05,028
No way.

45
00:03:05,028 --> 00:03:07,908
Then, you tried to hit Chef Lee on purpose?

46
00:03:07,908 --> 00:03:12,154
He ruined my life, so I better give him
a taste of his own medicine.

47
00:03:12,154 --> 00:03:15,210
Ah, I wanted revenge on Lee Hyuk...

48
00:03:15,210 --> 00:03:17,751
But you two ruined my plan!

49
00:03:17,751 --> 00:03:19,923
Don't slander him.

50
00:03:19,923 --> 00:03:21,259
He's a good person.

51
00:03:21,259 --> 00:03:22,888
Huh?

52
00:03:22,888 --> 00:03:24,830
That's true.

53
00:03:24,830 --> 00:03:27,005
He's not a bad person.

54
00:03:27,720 --> 00:03:29,685
There seems to be a misunderstanding.

55
00:03:29,685 --> 00:03:32,345
Do you have any idea
what he put me through?

56
00:03:32,345 --> 00:03:33,803
I thought you were my fan, mister.

57
00:03:33,803 --> 00:03:36,526
If you're my fan, you should take my side.

58
00:03:36,526 --> 00:03:38,963
You keep calling me a "fan".

59
00:03:38,963 --> 00:03:40,340
What does that mean?

60
00:03:40,340 --> 00:03:41,423
Oh, wow.

61
00:03:41,423 --> 00:03:44,384
Did you already leave my fandom
now that my career is over?

62
00:03:44,384 --> 00:03:45,459
What is leaving a fandom?

63
00:03:45,459 --> 00:03:48,636
Okay, that's enough.

64
00:03:48,636 --> 00:03:53,115
Jung Mi Sol, this guy stopped me
from calling the cops.

65
00:03:53,115 --> 00:03:57,061
So just drop the revenge act
and live your life properly

66
00:03:58,186 --> 00:04:01,463
I've had a rough day too.

67
00:04:01,463 --> 00:04:04,301
But I wouldn't act as recklessly as you.

68
00:04:04,301 --> 00:04:05,679
She's right.

69
00:04:05,679 --> 00:04:09,249
One moment of anger
can bring a hundred days of regret.

70
00:04:09,968 --> 00:04:12,286
Hurting him won't fix anything.

71
00:04:12,286 --> 00:04:13,794
What a joke.

72
00:04:13,794 --> 00:04:16,747
Neither of you even know
what he's really like.

73
00:04:17,849 --> 00:04:19,620
Oh, Mae Chang!

74
00:04:20,636 --> 00:04:24,321
You're still weak.
Lie down a little longer.

75
00:04:24,944 --> 00:04:26,098
Here?

76
00:04:26,098 --> 00:04:28,279
This is my room!

77
00:04:28,279 --> 00:04:30,803
Where am I supposed to sleep, then?

78
00:04:30,803 --> 00:04:32,041
My, my!

79
00:04:32,041 --> 00:04:34,670
Do you have no compassion, young lady?

80
00:04:34,670 --> 00:04:36,647
Are you going to kick Mae Chang out

81
00:04:36,647 --> 00:04:39,780
into the freezing cold when she looks this pale?

82
00:04:39,780 --> 00:04:41,892
That's heartless.

83
00:04:41,892 --> 00:04:44,043
You can't be serious.

84
00:04:44,043 --> 00:04:46,826
Who's been feeding you
and giving you shelter this whole time?

85
00:04:47,501 --> 00:04:51,850
Now I see why they say
never to take in a black-haired beast.

86
00:04:51,850 --> 00:04:55,856
Forget it, I don't want to rest
in this shabby room any longer.

87
00:04:56,788 --> 00:04:59,731
Did you say, "shabby?"

88
00:04:59,731 --> 00:05:02,418
I can't get myself behind the wheel today

89
00:05:02,418 --> 00:05:04,904
so can you take me home in my car, mister?

90
00:05:04,904 --> 00:05:06,168
Let's go.

91
00:05:06,168 --> 00:05:07,902
Hang on!

92
00:05:07,902 --> 00:05:09,886
Why are you taking Mr. Homeless?

93
00:05:09,886 --> 00:05:12,342
Call your manager.

94
00:05:12,342 --> 00:05:16,003
I don't have a manager.

95
00:05:16,774 --> 00:05:18,576
I fired him.

96
00:05:18,576 --> 00:05:21,335
I couldn't stand seeing him cry
because of me anymore.

97
00:05:21,335 --> 00:05:23,607
So, take me home.

98
00:05:23,607 --> 00:05:25,453
All right.

99
00:05:25,453 --> 00:05:27,916
I will take her home.

100
00:05:27,916 --> 00:05:29,623
What do you mean, "All right?"

101
00:05:29,623 --> 00:05:31,618
You don't even have a driver's license!

102
00:05:31,618 --> 00:05:33,446
What? He doesn't have a license?

103
00:05:34,080 --> 00:05:36,421
There's only so much he can do.

104
00:05:37,690 --> 00:05:41,424
I guess I need something called
a driver's license.

105
00:05:43,384 --> 00:05:47,595
Don't... I'm Jung Mi Sol.

106
00:05:58,885 --> 00:06:01,476
Look at her, sleeping soundly
in this shabby room.

107
00:06:02,425 --> 00:06:06,262
How is she so carefree
after causing so much trouble?

108
00:06:07,996 --> 00:06:12,455
And yet, I can't sleep just thinking about
reopening the diner tomorrow.

109
00:06:19,885 --> 00:06:21,052
Wait!

110
00:06:21,052 --> 00:06:23,132
There's a cockroach in my soup

111
00:06:23,132 --> 00:06:25,631
and that's your reaction?!

112
00:06:25,631 --> 00:06:27,414
Oh, my head hurts.

113
00:06:31,022 --> 00:06:32,794
Why is it so cold?

114
00:06:35,558 --> 00:06:37,597
I better repair this soon.

115
00:06:38,466 --> 00:06:40,119
Ugh, it's freezing.

116
00:06:47,744 --> 00:06:49,998
Aren't you cold, Mr. Homeless?

117
00:06:54,642 --> 00:06:56,687
- Thank you-
- Mae Chang!

118
00:06:56,687 --> 00:06:59,293
Don't you even have compassion, young lady?

119
00:06:59,293 --> 00:07:01,224
Are you going to kick Mae Chang out

120
00:07:01,224 --> 00:07:04,036
into the freezing cold
when she looks this pale?

121
00:07:04,036 --> 00:07:06,722
Who cares if he's cold?

122
00:07:14,193 --> 00:07:16,633
Mister, Mr. Homeless!

123
00:07:19,149 --> 00:07:20,838
Mister!

124
00:07:22,462 --> 00:07:24,561
He's freezing.

125
00:07:24,561 --> 00:07:26,110
Mister, wake up.

126
00:07:26,110 --> 00:07:28,185
You'll freeze to death if you sleep here!

127
00:07:28,185 --> 00:07:29,514
Mister!

128
00:07:31,541 --> 00:07:34,171
What is the matter?

129
00:07:34,171 --> 00:07:36,449
A young lady grabbing a man like that.

130
00:07:36,449 --> 00:07:38,642
Are you in heat or something?

131
00:07:38,642 --> 00:07:42,951
I should've just let you freeze.

132
00:07:47,828 --> 00:07:51,262
But why is it so cold here?

133
00:07:54,131 --> 00:07:57,657
Until I get that window fixed,
you should sleep upstairs.

134
00:08:01,623 --> 00:08:03,785
Come on, just go up.

135
00:08:03,785 --> 00:08:07,111
I'm not ready for this.

136
00:08:07,111 --> 00:08:09,665
Fine, then stay here and freeze.

137
00:08:17,635 --> 00:08:19,673
On second thought, I'm ready.

138
00:08:26,908 --> 00:08:29,043
What's that sound?

139
00:08:29,043 --> 00:08:30,899
Is it Mae Chang?

140
00:08:30,899 --> 00:08:32,314
Yes.

141
00:08:33,697 --> 00:08:36,388
So much for getting any sleep tonight.

142
00:08:37,644 --> 00:08:40,202
At least she seems to be sleeping well.

143
00:08:40,202 --> 00:08:43,208
Even her snoring makes you happy, huh?

144
00:08:43,208 --> 00:08:45,482
Wow, your dedication as a fan is next-level.

145
00:08:45,482 --> 00:08:47,321
Again, with that "fan" thing!

146
00:08:47,321 --> 00:08:49,488
What does that even mean?

147
00:08:49,488 --> 00:08:54,603
It just means liking and supporting someone.

148
00:08:56,158 --> 00:08:59,624
So that's why Mae Chang keeps calling me a fan.

149
00:08:59,624 --> 00:09:02,795
Among them, lunatic fans like you,
who chase after celebrities

150
00:09:02,795 --> 00:09:05,296
as if their life depended on it,
are called stalkers.

151
00:09:05,296 --> 00:09:08,209
My mind is perfectly sound!

152
00:09:09,008 --> 00:09:12,572
Of course, I cherish Mae Chang as an artist.

153
00:09:12,572 --> 00:09:14,235
But that's purely...

154
00:09:14,235 --> 00:09:16,043
Okay, stop right there.

155
00:09:16,043 --> 00:09:19,090
I don't need to hear the details.

156
00:09:20,091 --> 00:09:22,691
I left a blanket here,
so lay it down and sleep.

157
00:09:24,443 --> 00:09:26,083
Wait, this is...

158
00:09:26,083 --> 00:09:28,179
You washed my robe.

159
00:09:32,365 --> 00:09:34,703
It's spotless, perfectly cleaned.

160
00:09:34,703 --> 00:09:36,945
Of course.

161
00:09:36,945 --> 00:09:40,242
I almost dislocated my shoulder
trying to hand-wash that thing.

162
00:09:41,444 --> 00:09:43,026
Huh?

163
00:09:43,026 --> 00:09:44,682
What's this?

164
00:09:45,864 --> 00:09:48,930
It was ripped, so I stitched it up.

165
00:09:48,930 --> 00:09:50,671
And no, I wasn't the one who tore it.

166
00:09:50,671 --> 00:09:52,166
I know.

167
00:09:52,844 --> 00:09:54,787
But this...

168
00:09:56,058 --> 00:09:58,035
I was just bored.

169
00:09:58,035 --> 00:09:59,808
Is this... bungeoppang?

170
00:09:59,808 --> 00:10:02,356
Wait, why is this one only half a fish?

171
00:10:03,053 --> 00:10:04,577
I ran out of thread.

172
00:10:04,577 --> 00:10:06,645
If you don't like it, I can take it out.

173
00:10:07,256 --> 00:10:09,344
Who said I didn't like it?

174
00:10:09,344 --> 00:10:11,372
I was just making an observation.

175
00:10:13,859 --> 00:10:15,845
Then go to sleep.

176
00:10:18,283 --> 00:10:20,574
Thank you.

177
00:10:20,574 --> 00:10:24,418
The more I see you, the more I realize...
you're truly a warm-hearted person.

178
00:10:25,412 --> 00:10:31,092
I can't tell you how relieved I am that I met you
instead of someone else in this unfamiliar world.

179
00:10:36,554 --> 00:10:39,094
Didn't you call me heartless earlier?

180
00:10:41,224 --> 00:10:43,933
You even stormed out, saying
you didn't want to be used for money.

181
00:10:43,933 --> 00:10:46,728
And yet, here you are again.

182
00:10:46,728 --> 00:10:50,407
Come to think of it,
you're surprisingly spineless.

183
00:10:51,500 --> 00:10:53,168
How did you know?

184
00:10:53,168 --> 00:10:56,035
If there's one thing this Transcendent Genius lacks

185
00:10:56,035 --> 00:10:58,001
it's exactly that.

186
00:11:00,541 --> 00:11:03,061
And I'm the fool for taking you seriously.

187
00:11:03,061 --> 00:11:05,150
I came back because

188
00:11:05,150 --> 00:11:08,228
I realized you were right.

189
00:11:09,517 --> 00:11:12,950
After hearing what you said, I looked again.

190
00:11:13,917 --> 00:11:17,152
And this place isn't the Yuldoguk I dreamed of.

191
00:11:18,693 --> 00:11:23,159
Now, I think I understand
why you're so desperate for money.

192
00:11:25,450 --> 00:11:28,957
I'm sorry for pushing you earlier.

193
00:11:29,606 --> 00:11:33,652
I was just anxious about not being able
to pay my mom's hospital bills

194
00:11:33,652 --> 00:11:35,855
if the diner failed.

195
00:11:35,855 --> 00:11:39,595
However, money can be earned.

196
00:11:40,311 --> 00:11:44,492
If it helps you make money,
I'll gladly lend a hand.

197
00:11:46,063 --> 00:11:48,630
Because I never want to see you cry

198
00:11:49,496 --> 00:11:51,475
over money again.

199
00:11:53,750 --> 00:11:57,824
You don't want to see me cry?

200
00:11:58,830 --> 00:12:00,432
Why?

201
00:12:05,857 --> 00:12:07,635
Why, you ask?

202
00:12:08,859 --> 00:12:10,413
Because...

203
00:12:33,275 --> 00:12:34,368
Excuse me.

204
00:12:34,368 --> 00:12:37,857
About the car parked out front,
have you seen Jung Mi Sol by any chance?

205
00:12:37,857 --> 00:12:39,574
Oh, she's upstairs...

206
00:12:40,415 --> 00:12:42,965
Hey, aren't you Mi Sol's stalker?

207
00:12:42,965 --> 00:12:44,458
Where's Mi Sol?

208
00:12:44,458 --> 00:12:45,606
Watch your mouth!

209
00:12:45,606 --> 00:12:47,798
I'm not some lunatic!

210
00:12:48,702 --> 00:12:50,238
You're here for Jung Mi Sol, right?

211
00:12:50,238 --> 00:12:54,118
Yes, I'm her manager.
I've been looking everywhere for her.

212
00:12:59,995 --> 00:13:02,288
So that's what happened.

213
00:13:02,288 --> 00:13:06,219
She was acting strangely during our last call
so I was worried sick.

214
00:13:06,219 --> 00:13:09,288
Thank goodness nothing happened.

215
00:13:10,108 --> 00:13:13,912
This guy deserves a lot of credit for that.

216
00:13:14,597 --> 00:13:16,275
Thank you.

217
00:13:18,680 --> 00:13:22,287
I am not a stalker, just a regular fan!

218
00:13:23,919 --> 00:13:25,571
Mae Chang is sleeping soundly.

219
00:13:25,571 --> 00:13:29,446
So don't wake her.
Come back in the morning.

220
00:13:29,446 --> 00:13:30,937
Still, I can't just impose like this.

221
00:13:30,937 --> 00:13:34,256
She's been through a lot lately.

222
00:13:34,256 --> 00:13:36,553
At least let her get some proper rest.

223
00:13:39,081 --> 00:13:40,655
Then...

224
00:13:42,932 --> 00:13:45,152
Please contact me when she wakes up.

225
00:13:45,152 --> 00:13:46,717
Got it.

226
00:13:56,232 --> 00:13:58,215
Let's go upstairs and get some rest.

227
00:13:58,215 --> 00:13:59,731
It's late.

228
00:13:59,731 --> 00:14:01,432
Wait.

229
00:14:03,605 --> 00:14:06,332
We need to finish our conversation first.

230
00:14:07,587 --> 00:14:09,811
What conversation...?

231
00:14:09,811 --> 00:14:13,101
That thing you were about to say earlier.

232
00:14:13,101 --> 00:14:16,413
What exactly did you mean...

233
00:14:19,483 --> 00:14:23,482
when you said you don't want to see me cry?

234
00:14:26,182 --> 00:14:27,823
Well...

235
00:14:28,811 --> 00:14:32,136
When you cry...

236
00:14:38,111 --> 00:14:40,466
I'll just go first.

237
00:14:41,128 --> 00:14:43,329
Mr. Homeless, I think I...

238
00:14:43,329 --> 00:14:45,335
Because it's ugly!

239
00:14:45,335 --> 00:14:47,194
What?

240
00:14:47,194 --> 00:14:51,102
Your crying face is so ugly,

241
00:14:53,114 --> 00:14:55,726
that I couldn't possibly
bear to see it twice!

242
00:14:56,786 --> 00:14:58,190
Excuse me?

243
00:14:58,190 --> 00:15:03,383
I've seen a lot of ugly faces
back in Joseon...

244
00:15:03,383 --> 00:15:06,156
But compared to your crying face,
they were practically noble...

245
00:15:15,373 --> 00:15:17,722
I'm someone who has to return.

246
00:15:18,479 --> 00:15:21,938
I can't afford to let myself
have useless emotions.

247
00:15:58,056 --> 00:16:00,191
What's with the vibe here?

248
00:16:03,371 --> 00:16:05,450
Mae Chang, did you sleep well?

249
00:16:05,450 --> 00:16:08,732
I couldn't sleep a wink
because it was uncomfortable.

250
00:16:09,376 --> 00:16:11,974
But this feels even more awkward.

251
00:16:14,937 --> 00:16:17,918
Says the person waking up at noon.

252
00:16:17,918 --> 00:16:20,081
It's already that late?

253
00:16:21,029 --> 00:16:25,809
But why isn't there a single customer?

254
00:16:25,809 --> 00:16:27,573
Is it closed today?

255
00:16:27,573 --> 00:16:29,113
No.

256
00:16:29,113 --> 00:16:31,811
We're open, but we're having a slow day.

257
00:16:34,055 --> 00:16:36,195
You'll go out of business soon.

258
00:16:37,168 --> 00:16:39,260
Thanks for the vote of confidence.

259
00:16:39,260 --> 00:16:41,834
I'm just saying, it's a shame.

260
00:16:41,834 --> 00:16:45,955
If this were back when I was still popular,
I could've promoted the place.

261
00:16:45,955 --> 00:16:48,268
But now, that's not even an option.

262
00:16:48,875 --> 00:16:50,468
All right!

263
00:16:50,468 --> 00:16:52,943
Instead of waiting around
for customers who may never come,

264
00:16:52,943 --> 00:16:55,252
we should eat.

265
00:16:55,252 --> 00:16:57,267
I'll prepare something special.

266
00:16:58,002 --> 00:17:00,584
No thanks. I'll just throw it up anyway.

267
00:17:00,584 --> 00:17:03,110
You two enjoy your meal.

268
00:17:07,250 --> 00:17:08,910
I'll get going now.

269
00:17:08,910 --> 00:17:10,523
That won't do!

270
00:17:11,845 --> 00:17:15,988
This is a diner, after all,
so I can't let you leave on an empty stomach.

271
00:17:16,857 --> 00:17:20,936
I saw in a video that you have nausea issues.

272
00:17:20,936 --> 00:17:24,911
Even if you throw up,
you need to eat something to keep going.

273
00:17:26,964 --> 00:17:30,805
Not sure I want to eat food
from this kind of place...

274
00:17:33,517 --> 00:17:36,159
And what exactly do you mean by
this kind of place?

275
00:17:36,159 --> 00:17:40,059
It's lunchtime, and the place is empty.

276
00:17:40,059 --> 00:17:41,894
Isn't that a sign the food's bad.

277
00:17:41,894 --> 00:17:43,354
For crying out loud...

278
00:17:43,354 --> 00:17:45,822
Our food tastes amazing.

279
00:17:45,822 --> 00:17:49,168
Mr. Homeless, show her.

280
00:17:49,168 --> 00:17:50,785
I will.

281
00:17:50,785 --> 00:17:52,797
Please give me a moment.

282
00:18:02,903 --> 00:18:04,341
Wait.

283
00:18:04,341 --> 00:18:07,511
Your "special dish" is just porridge?

284
00:18:07,511 --> 00:18:09,295
I don't even like porridge.

285
00:18:09,295 --> 00:18:12,509
Did you say, "just porridge?"

286
00:18:12,509 --> 00:18:14,899
This is no ordinary porridge!

287
00:18:14,899 --> 00:18:18,970
It's Bangpungjuk, made from wild parsnip sprouts
that survive harsh winters before sprouting.

288
00:18:18,970 --> 00:18:22,463
Not only is it known to prevent strokes

289
00:18:22,463 --> 00:18:25,106
but it also improves circulation

290
00:18:25,106 --> 00:18:27,730
and relieves pain.

291
00:18:27,730 --> 00:18:30,155
And the flavor!

292
00:18:30,914 --> 00:18:34,354
The rich aroma fills your mouth
and lingers for days

293
00:18:34,354 --> 00:18:37,194
leaving you in a good mood
long after you've eaten it.

294
00:18:37,194 --> 00:18:41,383
That's why, despite having tasted
all of Joseon's finest dishes

295
00:18:41,383 --> 00:18:44,077
this remains one of my personal favorites.

296
00:18:44,914 --> 00:18:47,176
Fine, I'll try it.

297
00:18:47,176 --> 00:18:50,079
This guy must've sold
a lot of snake oil in his time.

298
00:19:01,548 --> 00:19:03,382
Oh?

299
00:19:03,382 --> 00:19:04,884
This is delicious.

300
00:19:05,770 --> 00:19:09,124
See? I told you so.

301
00:19:09,124 --> 00:19:12,066
Mr. Homeless is an amazing chef.

302
00:19:14,432 --> 00:19:16,111
Eat as much as you like.

303
00:19:16,720 --> 00:19:20,457
If the food is this good,
then why aren't there any customers?

304
00:19:22,376 --> 00:19:25,232
There was a cockroach incident yesterday.

305
00:19:26,642 --> 00:19:28,543
That is absolutely false!

306
00:19:28,543 --> 00:19:32,313
From the ingredients to the cooking tools,

307
00:19:32,313 --> 00:19:36,118
every part of my dish is meticulously controlled.

308
00:19:38,223 --> 00:19:42,132
Nothing enters my kitchen unless I allow it.

309
00:19:42,784 --> 00:19:44,230
I swear on my honor.

310
00:19:44,230 --> 00:19:47,639
No, my very life that this is the truth!

311
00:19:48,692 --> 00:19:50,263
It's really strange, isn't it?

312
00:19:50,263 --> 00:19:54,248
I've lived here since I was a kid

313
00:19:54,248 --> 00:19:57,190
and I've never once seen a cockroach.

314
00:19:57,951 --> 00:20:00,292
My mom was really sensitive about it.

315
00:20:00,292 --> 00:20:02,345
And yet somehow,
one magically appears in our soup?

316
00:20:02,345 --> 00:20:04,790
A paparazzi must've scammed you.

317
00:20:06,219 --> 00:20:08,080
- Paparazzi?
- Paparazzi?

318
00:20:09,267 --> 00:20:12,022
You know, those people who stalk celebrities,
waiting for dirt to use against them?

319
00:20:12,022 --> 00:20:14,729
They snap a bad photo,
then demand hush money.

320
00:20:16,537 --> 00:20:18,195
Didn't they ask for money?

321
00:20:24,436 --> 00:20:25,886
Detective Kang.

322
00:20:29,024 --> 00:20:30,565
You guys go on ahead.

323
00:20:30,565 --> 00:20:32,142
Let's go.

324
00:20:37,941 --> 00:20:40,143
You punk...

325
00:20:40,143 --> 00:20:42,536
How dare you come here! Huh?

326
00:20:44,012 --> 00:20:46,713
Come on, a job well done
deserves fair pay, doesn't it?

327
00:20:46,713 --> 00:20:48,790
You're just gonna ghost me like this?

328
00:20:48,790 --> 00:20:51,000
Look at this punk.

329
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:52,250
Are you crazy?

330
00:20:52,250 --> 00:20:53,527
Have you lost your mind?

331
00:20:53,527 --> 00:20:56,406
Why? Should we go inside together?

332
00:20:56,406 --> 00:21:00,852
What, missed the taste
of prison food after a few years?

333
00:21:02,306 --> 00:21:04,912
If people find out what you had me do...

334
00:21:04,912 --> 00:21:07,482
I doubt it'd be good for you either.

335
00:21:09,580 --> 00:21:12,172
And you think anyone would believe you?

336
00:21:12,172 --> 00:21:14,660
A punk like you who has been swindling

337
00:21:14,660 --> 00:21:16,666
and threatening people for a lifetime.

338
00:21:16,666 --> 00:21:19,117
Beat it, you punk.

339
00:21:19,117 --> 00:21:21,133
And don't even think about showing
your face around here again.

340
00:21:21,133 --> 00:21:24,797
And especially that alley,
stay the hell away.

341
00:21:24,797 --> 00:21:26,232
You heard me.

342
00:21:27,634 --> 00:21:29,592
I said, do you hear me?

343
00:21:40,982 --> 00:21:43,380
He didn't ask for money.

344
00:21:44,559 --> 00:21:48,642
Well. Some reporters publish
articles without demanding money.

345
00:21:50,897 --> 00:21:52,386
All done.

346
00:21:56,228 --> 00:21:58,847
You finished the whole bowl.

347
00:21:58,847 --> 00:22:01,388
Strangely enough, this porridge is amazing.

348
00:22:02,306 --> 00:22:03,727
I told you.

349
00:22:03,727 --> 00:22:06,377
Bangpungjuk is a true delicacy.

350
00:22:06,377 --> 00:22:07,828
Mi Sol!

351
00:22:09,443 --> 00:22:10,982
Hey...

352
00:22:10,982 --> 00:22:13,621
How did you even find this place?

353
00:22:14,233 --> 00:22:15,761
He was here last night, too.

354
00:22:15,761 --> 00:22:17,650
While you were sleeping.

355
00:22:17,650 --> 00:22:20,509
I told you to find other ways
to make a living.

356
00:22:20,509 --> 00:22:22,525
Why won't you ever listen?

357
00:22:22,525 --> 00:22:25,729
We're on the same boat.

358
00:22:25,729 --> 00:22:29,311
I practically raised you on my back.

359
00:22:29,311 --> 00:22:31,723
Look at your face, all worn out.

360
00:22:31,723 --> 00:22:33,914
You haven't been eating well, have you?

361
00:22:37,072 --> 00:22:38,410
Sorry.

362
00:22:38,410 --> 00:22:42,077
She slept well and had a good meal,
so don't worry.

363
00:22:43,501 --> 00:22:45,442
Is that so?

364
00:22:45,442 --> 00:22:49,080
Thanks anyway.

365
00:22:49,080 --> 00:22:51,153
Mi Sol, let's go.

366
00:22:51,153 --> 00:22:53,718
Sit and wait a little.

367
00:22:58,569 --> 00:23:01,148
As you can see, I just ate.

368
00:23:01,148 --> 00:23:03,822
If I leave now and throw up,
that'd be a waste.

369
00:23:03,822 --> 00:23:07,116
You know how expensive
my car's Italian leather seats are.

370
00:23:07,116 --> 00:23:10,025
If you've been dealing with this,
you should have told me.

371
00:23:10,025 --> 00:23:12,482
Why hide it from me as well?

372
00:23:12,482 --> 00:23:13,789
It's nothing I'm proud of.

373
00:23:13,789 --> 00:23:18,420
Mi Sol, can't you stop
making yourself throw up?

374
00:23:18,420 --> 00:23:20,961
It's ruining your body.

375
00:23:20,961 --> 00:23:22,977
You're not even working right now.

376
00:23:22,977 --> 00:23:24,402
Why not take a break from dieting?

377
00:23:24,402 --> 00:23:27,276
It's not because I'm on a diet!

378
00:23:27,276 --> 00:23:28,748
No?

379
00:23:29,333 --> 00:23:31,529
I wish that were true.

380
00:23:31,529 --> 00:23:35,018
Don't tell me Lee Hyuk fooled you too.

381
00:23:36,323 --> 00:23:40,147
Then why do you throw up everything you eat?

382
00:23:43,726 --> 00:23:45,571
Back when...

383
00:23:45,571 --> 00:23:48,409
I was doing a lot of commercials as a kid.

384
00:23:48,409 --> 00:23:51,630
Everyone wanted me to stop growing.

385
00:23:51,630 --> 00:23:54,419
Directors, advertisers...

386
00:23:54,419 --> 00:23:56,172
and even fans.

387
00:23:56,902 --> 00:23:58,887
But especially my mom.

388
00:24:02,917 --> 00:24:04,671
Jung Mi Sol!

389
00:24:08,117 --> 00:24:09,518
Mi Sol, are you out of your mind?

390
00:24:09,518 --> 00:24:12,181
Did you hear what the director said?

391
00:24:12,181 --> 00:24:16,170
Everyone here is relying on you

392
00:24:16,943 --> 00:24:20,977
and you can't even stop eating?

393
00:24:22,755 --> 00:24:24,411
Open your mouth.

394
00:24:26,478 --> 00:24:29,164
Open up and spit it out!

395
00:24:31,427 --> 00:24:33,490
Mom...

396
00:24:35,619 --> 00:24:38,513
If you keep growing

397
00:24:38,513 --> 00:24:41,217
your career is over.

398
00:24:41,880 --> 00:24:45,597
No one will even look at you.

399
00:24:46,818 --> 00:24:48,829
Is that what you want?

400
00:24:50,884 --> 00:24:52,961
As your mom...

401
00:24:52,961 --> 00:24:55,537
I believe in you.

402
00:24:58,015 --> 00:25:01,513
The pressure not to eat kept getting worse.

403
00:25:02,173 --> 00:25:05,203
Eventually, my body started rejecting food.

404
00:25:05,203 --> 00:25:06,992
Yes, mom.

405
00:25:08,346 --> 00:25:10,843
She's gotten way too big.

406
00:25:10,843 --> 00:25:13,652
She was so cute as a kid, but now...

407
00:25:14,700 --> 00:25:16,408
A child model's career ends
the moment they grow taller.

408
00:25:16,408 --> 00:25:18,602
Why put so much pressure on a kid?

409
00:25:20,167 --> 00:25:22,265
As your mom.

410
00:25:22,265 --> 00:25:24,804
I believe in you.

411
00:25:26,696 --> 00:25:29,029
At first, it only happened sometimes

412
00:25:29,659 --> 00:25:31,683
but then it became constant.

413
00:25:31,683 --> 00:25:35,808
Now, no matter what I eat,
I throw it back up

414
00:25:37,073 --> 00:25:39,723
I've been to so many doctors

415
00:25:39,723 --> 00:25:41,673
but nothing helps.

416
00:25:43,359 --> 00:25:46,487
I had no idea...

417
00:25:46,487 --> 00:25:48,615
I'm sorry, Mi Sol.

418
00:25:51,000 --> 00:25:53,841
So, it comes from deep pain.

419
00:25:53,841 --> 00:25:55,737
It must have been hard for you.

420
00:25:58,344 --> 00:25:59,647
Oh?

421
00:25:59,647 --> 00:26:03,424
Wait… It's been a while since you ate.

422
00:26:03,424 --> 00:26:06,092
Shouldn't you have thrown up by now?

423
00:26:06,092 --> 00:26:08,251
You're right.

424
00:26:08,251 --> 00:26:09,866
It's weird.

425
00:26:09,866 --> 00:26:12,542
Are you okay? Do you feel sick?

426
00:26:12,542 --> 00:26:14,638
No.

427
00:26:14,638 --> 00:26:16,905
This has never happened before...

428
00:26:19,880 --> 00:26:23,592
I made plenty, so take some home with you.

429
00:26:30,032 --> 00:26:31,517
Here you go.

430
00:26:32,512 --> 00:26:35,308
Come by anytime you're hungry.

431
00:26:35,308 --> 00:26:37,908
There will always be a meal
waiting for you here.

432
00:26:39,174 --> 00:26:42,040
I really wasn't planning on
taking in a stalker.

433
00:26:42,040 --> 00:26:44,197
But you keep impressing me.

434
00:26:44,197 --> 00:26:47,349
I'm not a stalker.

435
00:26:48,196 --> 00:26:49,802
I'm just a fan.

436
00:26:51,785 --> 00:26:55,347
Take care of yourself, Mi Sol.

437
00:26:55,347 --> 00:26:57,221
Both your body and your heart.

438
00:26:57,221 --> 00:26:59,906
Can I call you Eun Sil?

439
00:26:59,906 --> 00:27:01,867
Thank you, Eun Sil.

440
00:27:05,522 --> 00:27:08,521
So, how long have you two
been living together?

441
00:27:08,521 --> 00:27:09,880
Huh?

442
00:27:11,444 --> 00:27:14,435
Live together? It's nothing like that!

443
00:27:15,580 --> 00:27:17,890
Mister, why are you just standing there?

444
00:27:17,890 --> 00:27:19,543
Say something.

445
00:27:21,481 --> 00:27:23,454
We are, uh...

446
00:27:25,719 --> 00:27:28,662
We are strictly… business partners.

447
00:27:29,512 --> 00:27:31,345
I see.

448
00:27:32,920 --> 00:27:34,609
That's perfect.

449
00:27:41,910 --> 00:27:43,717
Thank you.

450
00:27:44,386 --> 00:27:46,039
Take care.

451
00:27:49,695 --> 00:27:51,494
"That's perfect?"

452
00:27:52,560 --> 00:27:54,406
What's perfect?

453
00:27:57,352 --> 00:27:58,554
What's wrong?

454
00:27:58,554 --> 00:28:02,193
Did my ugly face startle you
after looking at pretty Mi Sol for too long?

455
00:28:02,193 --> 00:28:04,444
There you go again!

456
00:28:04,444 --> 00:28:06,468
You're not ugly.

457
00:28:07,885 --> 00:28:10,437
Just your crying face is.

458
00:28:10,437 --> 00:28:12,359
Why, you!

459
00:28:14,024 --> 00:28:15,708
Never mind.

460
00:28:15,708 --> 00:28:18,125
There's something more important right now.

461
00:28:19,200 --> 00:28:20,992
More important?

462
00:28:20,992 --> 00:28:22,619
Like what?

463
00:28:31,173 --> 00:28:32,795
What are you doing?

464
00:28:33,624 --> 00:28:36,455
Are you picking fights
with those haters again?

465
00:28:36,455 --> 00:28:37,946
No.

466
00:28:37,946 --> 00:28:39,561
Like Mi Sol said.

467
00:28:39,561 --> 00:28:44,560
If the guy who claimed to find a cockroach
in our food was after money…

468
00:28:44,560 --> 00:28:47,377
Then he's probably pulled this scam before.

469
00:28:47,377 --> 00:28:49,353
[Some shady guy's been lurking around]
If I dig through similar cases

470
00:28:49,353 --> 00:28:52,155
I might find a lead.

471
00:28:52,155 --> 00:28:55,371
So you can pick fights
and track down criminals

472
00:28:55,371 --> 00:28:59,033
all on that tiny plank?

473
00:29:00,205 --> 00:29:02,361
What an enchanting object.

474
00:29:03,959 --> 00:29:06,370
Mister, can you untie this for me?

475
00:29:07,824 --> 00:29:10,989
You should keep it on a bit longer.

476
00:29:10,989 --> 00:29:13,055
This is life or death for our diner.

477
00:29:13,055 --> 00:29:14,528
Hurry.

478
00:29:15,648 --> 00:29:17,285
All right.

479
00:29:29,329 --> 00:29:31,277
Let's see...

480
00:29:34,084 --> 00:29:36,121
Luckily, it looks like it's healing well.

481
00:29:36,121 --> 00:29:37,678
You should be fine.

482
00:29:51,593 --> 00:29:55,239
I better go buy ingredients for tomorrow.

483
00:30:49,996 --> 00:30:52,810
Did you enjoy the meal?

484
00:30:52,810 --> 00:30:54,790
I enjoyed it very much.

485
00:30:54,790 --> 00:30:56,290
But then...

486
00:30:57,094 --> 00:31:00,330
How should I put it?
The dishes feel a bit modern.

487
00:31:01,244 --> 00:31:07,404
The dignitary wishes to showcase
authentic Korean flavors to the state guests.

488
00:31:07,404 --> 00:31:09,695
Yes, I understand.

489
00:31:09,695 --> 00:31:12,997
I'll revise the course menu
to focus on traditional elements.

490
00:31:12,997 --> 00:31:17,288
I know you're deeply invested in
globalizing Korean cuisine, Chef Lee.

491
00:31:17,288 --> 00:31:19,793
Taking charge of this state dinner

492
00:31:19,793 --> 00:31:22,562
will be a great opportunity for you as well.

493
00:31:22,562 --> 00:31:25,246
It would be a tremendous honor.

494
00:31:25,246 --> 00:31:30,062
I'll do my best to craft a menu
that meets your expectations.

495
00:31:34,484 --> 00:31:37,160
I heard you're working on
a Korean cuisine-themed project.

496
00:31:37,160 --> 00:31:39,027
Is everything going well?

497
00:31:39,027 --> 00:31:41,584
Yes, it's in the final stages.

498
00:31:41,584 --> 00:31:43,309
I'm looking forward to it.

499
00:31:44,619 --> 00:31:46,348
No need to see me out.

500
00:31:51,560 --> 00:31:53,516
Sir.

501
00:31:53,516 --> 00:31:56,143
There's a call for you.

502
00:31:56,143 --> 00:31:57,870
Who is it?

503
00:31:57,870 --> 00:31:59,510
Well...

504
00:31:59,510 --> 00:32:04,082
He didn't give a name
but said he works with Detective Kang.

505
00:32:07,891 --> 00:32:09,489
Hang up.

506
00:32:10,852 --> 00:32:13,339
From now on

507
00:32:13,339 --> 00:32:17,504
handle these calls without informing me.

508
00:32:25,492 --> 00:32:27,732
[I think I got scammed by a shady customer]

509
00:32:32,718 --> 00:32:34,340
Found him.

510
00:32:36,915 --> 00:32:40,522
[If you've had a similar experience
with this man, please get in touch]

511
00:32:40,522 --> 00:32:42,430
[Your post has been uploaded]

512
00:32:48,465 --> 00:32:50,173
Chef Lee!

513
00:32:53,051 --> 00:32:54,917
No customers...

514
00:32:54,917 --> 00:32:56,536
Again.

515
00:32:57,188 --> 00:33:00,105
We only had one table earlier,
and that was it.

516
00:33:00,105 --> 00:33:02,711
Keeping the place open
with no customers every day...

517
00:33:02,711 --> 00:33:05,717
The losses must be piling up.

518
00:33:07,561 --> 00:33:11,027
At this rate, we really might go under.

519
00:33:11,027 --> 00:33:12,241
Would you like some coffee?

520
00:33:12,241 --> 00:33:14,107
No.

521
00:33:14,107 --> 00:33:15,625
But thank you.

522
00:33:15,625 --> 00:33:17,226
Please have a seat.

523
00:33:22,293 --> 00:33:27,800
Once a bad rumor spreads,
it's hard to recover.

524
00:33:27,800 --> 00:33:31,071
I've experienced it firsthand,

525
00:33:31,071 --> 00:33:33,161
so I know how it feels.

526
00:33:34,556 --> 00:33:36,654
You mean Jung Mi Sol's case?

527
00:33:38,496 --> 00:33:44,718
Eun Sil, even with things like this...
Do you still want to keep running this place?

528
00:33:46,069 --> 00:33:50,222
I can cover all your losses.

529
00:33:50,222 --> 00:33:53,912
With that money,
you wouldn't have to struggle.

530
00:33:53,912 --> 00:33:56,953
You could focus entirely on
caring for your mother.

531
00:33:58,364 --> 00:34:01,275
It's a generous offer

532
00:34:01,275 --> 00:34:03,448
but I can't just walk away.

533
00:34:03,448 --> 00:34:06,831
This is the place my mom
built from the ground up.

534
00:34:06,831 --> 00:34:09,927
Even if I have to close,
I need to restore its reputation first.

535
00:34:09,927 --> 00:34:13,456
But your losses will only keep growing

536
00:34:13,456 --> 00:34:17,603
and restoring a reputation
is easier said than done.

537
00:34:17,603 --> 00:34:20,622
That's why I started looking into that guy.

538
00:34:20,622 --> 00:34:22,524
Turns out, he's a repeat offender.

539
00:34:23,295 --> 00:34:26,687
I posted his photo
in restaurant owner communities.

540
00:34:26,687 --> 00:34:28,383
Want to see?

541
00:34:29,141 --> 00:34:31,560
No, that's okay.

542
00:34:33,696 --> 00:34:34,991
Uh...

543
00:34:34,991 --> 00:34:39,175
But... will catching him really change anything?

544
00:34:39,175 --> 00:34:42,259
At the very least, it'll stop him
from targeting other restaurants.

545
00:34:42,259 --> 00:34:44,920
That's reason enough for me.

546
00:34:44,920 --> 00:34:46,816
I'll make sure he gets caught.

547
00:34:46,816 --> 00:34:50,245
And once we clear our name...

548
00:34:51,824 --> 00:34:53,362
Even then...

549
00:34:54,279 --> 00:34:58,155
If things still don't improve...

550
00:34:59,139 --> 00:35:03,619
then you have to buy this place
at a good price.

551
00:35:05,463 --> 00:35:06,768
I will.

552
00:35:06,768 --> 00:35:10,292
But if it ever gets too hard, don't hesitate.

553
00:35:10,292 --> 00:35:12,372
Come straight to me.

554
00:35:23,167 --> 00:35:24,720
My man!

555
00:35:25,768 --> 00:35:28,068
You seem to be in a good mood.

556
00:35:29,007 --> 00:35:31,291
Not really.

557
00:35:31,291 --> 00:35:33,852
If it's something good, you should share it.

558
00:35:35,057 --> 00:35:37,678
Just like bungeoppang.

559
00:35:37,678 --> 00:35:40,983
I'm fine, really.

560
00:35:40,983 --> 00:35:42,787
It's still warm.

561
00:35:44,036 --> 00:35:47,252
I'm not feeling too well.

562
00:35:47,252 --> 00:35:50,830
Oh, that is concerning.

563
00:35:50,830 --> 00:35:53,893
Could it be from the accident?

564
00:35:54,865 --> 00:35:56,091
Oh, right!

565
00:35:56,091 --> 00:35:58,971
Thank you for letting it slide back then.

566
00:35:58,971 --> 00:36:03,588
It's nothing, I didn't want things
to go out of hand, either.

567
00:36:03,588 --> 00:36:06,729
As expected, you're a man of great generosity!

568
00:36:06,729 --> 00:36:10,311
I made sure Mae Chang understands
not to pull anything like that again

569
00:36:10,311 --> 00:36:12,363
so you don't have to worry.

570
00:36:12,363 --> 00:36:14,740
Yes, then...

571
00:36:20,851 --> 00:36:25,209
I hope he stays healthy.

572
00:36:41,701 --> 00:36:44,489
Traditional flavors...

573
00:36:58,481 --> 00:37:00,002
Mister.

574
00:37:01,708 --> 00:37:06,326
If the diner really goes under,
what will you do?

575
00:37:07,207 --> 00:37:09,173
Watch your words!

576
00:37:09,173 --> 00:37:10,596
Don't say such things!

577
00:37:10,596 --> 00:37:12,570
They say words have power.

578
00:37:15,462 --> 00:37:17,575
The truth will come out eventually

579
00:37:17,575 --> 00:37:20,315
and customers will return.

580
00:37:21,206 --> 00:37:23,099
Easy for you to say.

581
00:37:24,463 --> 00:37:28,249
Why are you cooking so hard
when we barely have any customers?

582
00:37:28,249 --> 00:37:32,791
My man said he wasn't feeling well,
so I'm making Bangpungjuk for him.

583
00:37:32,791 --> 00:37:35,230
Chef Lee said he's unwell?

584
00:37:35,230 --> 00:37:39,380
He seemed to be in a good mood,
but he did say so.

585
00:37:40,209 --> 00:37:42,985
He seemed fine earlier.

586
00:37:44,102 --> 00:37:46,575
All right, then...

587
00:37:47,389 --> 00:37:50,121
How should I pack this for him?

588
00:37:58,990 --> 00:38:00,238
This looks perfect!

589
00:38:00,238 --> 00:38:02,652
Oh, not that!

590
00:38:02,652 --> 00:38:05,396
This is my mom's prized jar.

591
00:38:05,396 --> 00:38:08,569
It's been passed down
to the daughters in our family.

592
00:38:09,354 --> 00:38:10,958
Oh?

593
00:38:11,556 --> 00:38:14,753
I just thought it'd be perfect
since it has a lid.

594
00:38:18,311 --> 00:38:19,966
Close it, now.

595
00:38:19,966 --> 00:38:23,219
If you open it, my mom will flip out.

596
00:38:23,219 --> 00:38:26,483
There's something inside...

597
00:38:27,234 --> 00:38:30,459
She said it's an heirloom
from our ancestors.

598
00:38:30,459 --> 00:38:34,250
If it's been passed down that long,
it must be worth a fortune, right?

599
00:38:35,448 --> 00:38:38,655
Should I take it
to a TV show for appraisal?

600
00:38:38,655 --> 00:38:41,672
It doesn't seem all that valuable...

601
00:38:41,672 --> 00:38:43,339
Excuse me?!

602
00:38:44,412 --> 00:38:48,099
Anyway, what should I use
to pack the porridge?

603
00:39:02,032 --> 00:39:04,058
Sir.

604
00:39:04,058 --> 00:39:06,131
You have a visitor.

605
00:39:12,745 --> 00:39:14,467
Who are you?

606
00:39:14,467 --> 00:39:16,613
Oh, Chef Lee Hyuk!

607
00:39:18,233 --> 00:39:22,281
I've tried calling you several times,
but you're not easy to reach.

608
00:39:23,582 --> 00:39:26,529
I asked who you are.

609
00:39:28,003 --> 00:39:31,234
Come on, you don't recognize me?

610
00:39:31,234 --> 00:39:34,526
You must've seen the video
I sent Detective Kang.

611
00:39:35,616 --> 00:39:38,317
I have no idea what you're talking about

612
00:39:38,317 --> 00:39:41,514
I knew something was up
the moment Kang started snooping around

613
00:39:41,514 --> 00:39:44,870
this fancy restaurant of yours.

614
00:39:44,870 --> 00:39:48,733
The guy seriously underestimates me.

615
00:39:49,696 --> 00:39:53,659
By the way, this place is impressive.

616
00:39:53,659 --> 00:39:56,008
You must be making good money.

617
00:39:56,008 --> 00:40:00,089
Please stop blathering and leave.

618
00:40:00,089 --> 00:40:02,297
Before I report you for business interference.

619
00:40:08,252 --> 00:40:10,265
It was you.

620
00:40:10,265 --> 00:40:12,506
The one who ordered to shut down that diner.

621
00:40:15,552 --> 00:40:21,064
Look, I didn't want to come here
and cause a scene.

622
00:40:21,064 --> 00:40:24,131
But now, the entire nation knows my face
thanks to someone.

623
00:40:24,131 --> 00:40:26,517
So now I can't even make a living.

624
00:40:28,059 --> 00:40:30,123
Let's cut to the chase.

625
00:40:30,123 --> 00:40:33,572
Just pay me what I'm owed,

626
00:40:33,572 --> 00:40:36,650
and I'll walk away quietly.

627
00:40:39,486 --> 00:40:43,983
Whatever you've done has nothing to do with me.

628
00:40:43,983 --> 00:40:46,470
Take your complaints elsewhere.

629
00:40:47,964 --> 00:40:49,987
Over here!

630
00:40:49,987 --> 00:40:52,691
Send this man out right now.

631
00:40:52,691 --> 00:40:54,272
- Please leave.
- Please leave, sir.

632
00:40:54,272 --> 00:40:55,906
- Come on out!
- Thank you.

633
00:40:57,121 --> 00:40:59,262
- Coming through.
- Let go of me!

634
00:41:05,755 --> 00:41:08,806
Detective Kang, how the hell...

635
00:41:09,978 --> 00:41:12,254
are you planning to handle this?!

636
00:41:13,426 --> 00:41:15,198
- Get out!
- Why are you doing this to me?

637
00:41:15,198 --> 00:41:16,190
Careful!

638
00:41:16,190 --> 00:41:19,664
Watch yourself,
you nearly spilled the porridge!

639
00:41:20,779 --> 00:41:23,376
Wait, you're...

640
00:41:24,718 --> 00:41:28,344
You're that pyeonsa who falsely
claimed there was filth in my food!

641
00:41:28,344 --> 00:41:30,306
[Pyeonsa: A swindler in the Joseon era]

642
00:41:30,306 --> 00:41:32,066
Hold this for me.

643
00:41:33,372 --> 00:41:35,574
I've been waiting for this moment!

644
00:41:35,574 --> 00:41:38,976
What do you mean, false claim?
I just said what I saw!

645
00:41:38,976 --> 00:41:41,283
Then why did you run away back then?

646
00:41:41,283 --> 00:41:44,280
Let's settle this once and for all.

647
00:41:44,280 --> 00:41:47,082
A fraud like you deserves
to be paraded around Gwanghwamun!

648
00:41:47,082 --> 00:41:49,579
You got proof, huh?
Where's your proof I was lying?

649
00:41:49,579 --> 00:41:52,159
- You have none, do you? Now let go!
- You're still spouting lies!

650
00:41:52,159 --> 00:41:55,572
- Let go of me!
- How long do you plan on lying?

651
00:41:55,572 --> 00:41:57,497
Why are you like this?! Let's talk it out!

652
00:41:57,497 --> 00:41:59,391
Oh, let go...

653
00:42:00,098 --> 00:42:01,450
You!

654
00:42:02,596 --> 00:42:05,070
What are you doing here?!

655
00:42:08,558 --> 00:42:12,226
Chef Lee, what should I do?
Should I spill the beans or not?

656
00:42:13,329 --> 00:42:15,893
Go inside. Okay.

657
00:42:15,893 --> 00:42:18,947
Chef, do you know this man?

658
00:42:21,121 --> 00:42:24,627
This is the bastard who lied about
finding a cockroach in our food!

659
00:42:24,627 --> 00:42:26,947
I mean... This is the guy.

660
00:42:26,947 --> 00:42:29,908
Who said I was lying?
Where's your proof, huh?

661
00:42:29,908 --> 00:42:31,295
All you do is serve dirty food.

662
00:42:31,295 --> 00:42:33,216
How dare you!

663
00:42:33,216 --> 00:42:36,153
How dare you spew more lies?!

664
00:42:37,595 --> 00:42:40,164
You want proof?

665
00:42:40,901 --> 00:42:42,703
Take a good look.

666
00:42:43,548 --> 00:42:46,647
It's the cries of the restaurant owners you've scammed!

667
00:42:48,264 --> 00:42:49,995
Darn it.

668
00:42:50,609 --> 00:42:52,947
So, you're the one who put my face
all over the internet!

669
00:42:56,342 --> 00:42:59,769
Chef, how do you know him?

670
00:43:00,884 --> 00:43:04,565
I don't know him.

671
00:43:04,565 --> 00:43:06,207
Of course.

672
00:43:06,207 --> 00:43:08,861
My man wouldn't be
involved with trash like him!

673
00:43:08,861 --> 00:43:10,451
Oh, really?

674
00:43:11,408 --> 00:43:14,998
Then why was he coming out of Dorae?

675
00:43:18,562 --> 00:43:20,039
That's because...

676
00:43:32,422 --> 00:43:33,978
You, punk...

677
00:43:33,978 --> 00:43:36,171
Didn't I tell you not to set foot
in this neighborhood again?

678
00:43:36,171 --> 00:43:37,827
You are...

679
00:43:38,540 --> 00:43:40,113
that officer!

680
00:43:41,175 --> 00:43:43,931
What brings you here, Detective Kang?

681
00:43:45,923 --> 00:43:48,966
He tried the same stunt at our restaurant.

682
00:43:48,966 --> 00:43:51,489
I just finished calling the police on him.

683
00:43:52,354 --> 00:43:55,178
- What the hell are you talking about?!
- You, punk.

684
00:43:55,178 --> 00:43:58,736
I didn't know he was the man
you were looking for, Eun Sil.

685
00:43:58,736 --> 00:44:00,325
This is great.

686
00:44:00,926 --> 00:44:04,184
So, after messing with our place,
you went after my man too?

687
00:44:04,184 --> 00:44:06,600
What a scoundrel!

688
00:44:06,600 --> 00:44:08,495
Oh, you want me to talk?

689
00:44:08,495 --> 00:44:09,815
Should I start spilling
who the real scumbag is here?!

690
00:44:09,815 --> 00:44:11,670
You, punk...

691
00:44:11,670 --> 00:44:13,349
Save it and just come with me.

692
00:44:29,814 --> 00:44:31,228
Chef Lee.

693
00:44:31,228 --> 00:44:34,313
You just saved our diner.

694
00:44:34,959 --> 00:44:37,926
Did I... Save your diner?

695
00:44:37,926 --> 00:44:40,180
Once the police confirm his crimes

696
00:44:40,180 --> 00:44:42,958
our diner will finally clear its name.

697
00:44:45,346 --> 00:44:47,841
You've saved us!

698
00:44:49,158 --> 00:44:52,658
You could say that
from a little further away.

699
00:44:54,454 --> 00:44:57,325
I'm glad I could help.

700
00:44:58,122 --> 00:45:02,164
Now I feel like I can keep going.

701
00:45:02,164 --> 00:45:04,848
It's all thanks to you.

702
00:45:04,848 --> 00:45:07,447
Oh, wow!

703
00:45:07,447 --> 00:45:09,963
I don't even know
how to express my gratitude!

704
00:45:11,498 --> 00:45:15,174
I get it, enough of that.

705
00:45:15,174 --> 00:45:18,967
I won't give up and do my best.

706
00:45:18,967 --> 00:45:21,231
Thinking of you, Chef Lee.

707
00:45:25,062 --> 00:45:26,699
I can do this!

708
00:45:30,054 --> 00:45:33,110
Someone in hanbok dropped this off earlier…

709
00:46:02,929 --> 00:46:04,889
Come to think of it…

710
00:46:04,889 --> 00:46:08,784
I can still get rid of him
to bring down that diner.

711
00:46:18,553 --> 00:46:21,819
What's all that?

712
00:46:21,819 --> 00:46:24,798
We can't just sit around
waiting for customers.

713
00:46:24,798 --> 00:46:26,697
What's the point of saying that we're clean?

714
00:46:26,697 --> 00:46:28,984
We have to show it.

715
00:46:29,798 --> 00:46:31,727
That makes sense.

716
00:46:31,727 --> 00:46:33,959
Seeing is believing, after all.

717
00:46:36,694 --> 00:46:39,707
You said words have power, right?

718
00:46:41,123 --> 00:46:44,775
One step back for two steps forward!
Let's turn crisis into opportunity!

719
00:46:44,775 --> 00:46:46,643
Let's do this!

720
00:46:48,136 --> 00:46:51,682
That's quite a bit of enthusiasm.

721
00:46:54,024 --> 00:46:56,210
Down, like this.

722
00:46:58,104 --> 00:46:59,258
Okay?

723
00:47:02,434 --> 00:47:03,273
Going up!

724
00:47:03,273 --> 00:47:06,098
No, not up! Go down.

725
00:47:06,098 --> 00:47:07,577
Great! Isn't this fun?

726
00:47:07,577 --> 00:47:10,521
You need to match the line.

727
00:47:20,816 --> 00:47:22,611
My goodness, look at me

728
00:47:22,611 --> 00:47:24,727
I almost missed my mom's visiting hours

729
00:47:24,727 --> 00:47:25,958
I'll be back soon,

730
00:47:25,958 --> 00:47:28,481
so make sure to finish painting all of this.

731
00:47:28,481 --> 00:47:30,019
All of it?

732
00:47:30,019 --> 00:47:31,397
- All of it.
- Alone?

733
00:47:31,397 --> 00:47:32,730
I'm off!

734
00:47:32,730 --> 00:47:34,716
Finish everything!

735
00:47:34,716 --> 00:47:36,564
Have a safe trip.

736
00:47:50,863 --> 00:47:53,033
Was it like this?

737
00:47:57,091 --> 00:47:58,470
My man!

738
00:48:01,917 --> 00:48:04,777
I was wondering if you had a moment.

739
00:48:06,084 --> 00:48:08,849
The young lady went to the hospital.

740
00:48:09,869 --> 00:48:12,728
But I'm not here to see her.

741
00:48:12,728 --> 00:48:14,477
I'm here for you.

742
00:48:15,384 --> 00:48:16,981
Me?

743
00:48:18,352 --> 00:48:22,153
Never thought I'd see the day
you'd seek me out first.

744
00:48:22,153 --> 00:48:24,118
I am all yours.

745
00:48:24,812 --> 00:48:28,580
This isn't the best place to talk.

746
00:48:28,580 --> 00:48:30,812
Shall we head to my restaurant?

747
00:48:30,812 --> 00:48:33,141
What is this about?

748
00:48:33,776 --> 00:48:37,798
Mom, I spread that guy's photo all over the place

749
00:48:37,798 --> 00:48:40,127
so he can never pull that trick again.

750
00:48:40,127 --> 00:48:42,034
But can you believe it?

751
00:48:42,034 --> 00:48:48,073
He tried it again at Chef Lee's
restaurant and got caught.

752
00:48:48,073 --> 00:48:51,809
Guess the saying is true,
"Bad guys always get what they deserve".

753
00:48:51,809 --> 00:48:55,094
Maybe there is some truth to that.

754
00:48:56,142 --> 00:48:57,861
Well...

755
00:48:57,861 --> 00:49:00,514
This time, it wasn't heaven that punished him.

756
00:49:00,514 --> 00:49:02,758
It was Chef Lee.

757
00:49:04,519 --> 00:49:07,380
He's such a generous person.

758
00:49:12,604 --> 00:49:17,099
Mom, we're remodeling the diner right now.

759
00:49:17,099 --> 00:49:20,973
You'll be surprised when you see it.

760
00:49:22,049 --> 00:49:24,155
If you're curious, wake up soon.

761
00:49:24,155 --> 00:49:25,867
I'll get going now.

762
00:49:43,806 --> 00:49:45,874
Where did Mr. Homeless go?

763
00:49:58,407 --> 00:50:00,438
Where's this chill coming from…

764
00:50:09,853 --> 00:50:14,949
I don't think we ever had a chance
to sit down and talk.

765
00:50:15,935 --> 00:50:21,165
I thought it'd be good to talk openly at least once.

766
00:50:22,050 --> 00:50:24,966
I've been wanting that for a while, my man.

767
00:50:25,823 --> 00:50:30,845
A proper talk needs a drink between men.

768
00:50:30,845 --> 00:50:32,208
Here, have some.

769
00:50:44,089 --> 00:50:46,556
I should be finishing the paint job...

770
00:50:49,943 --> 00:50:52,524
But I suppose one glass wouldn't hurt.

771
00:51:00,303 --> 00:51:01,867
Wait...

772
00:51:02,582 --> 00:51:04,590
Did you...

773
00:51:05,619 --> 00:51:06,608
Yes?

774
00:51:06,608 --> 00:51:09,941
Does something seem off?

775
00:51:09,941 --> 00:51:12,202
Did you add honey to the liquor?

776
00:51:13,122 --> 00:51:15,921
There's no way I can stop at one.

777
00:51:18,356 --> 00:51:20,553
Drink as much as you like.

778
00:51:20,553 --> 00:51:23,355
We have plenty of liquor.

779
00:51:29,912 --> 00:51:34,026
Where did he and why isn't he back yet?

780
00:51:34,026 --> 00:51:36,824
Did he run away just because
I made him paint?

781
00:51:57,241 --> 00:51:58,648
[Heo's Diner]
[Serving meals with sincerity]

782
00:52:06,542 --> 00:52:10,334
Your cooking skills are exquisite.

783
00:52:11,762 --> 00:52:13,631
The porridge was truly delicious.

784
00:52:13,631 --> 00:52:16,015
Really?

785
00:52:16,015 --> 00:52:19,809
Hearing that from you,
I feel like I'm soaring.

786
00:52:21,747 --> 00:52:24,212
If you don't mind me asking

787
00:52:24,962 --> 00:52:27,125
what's your secret?

788
00:52:27,125 --> 00:52:29,829
There are no secrets.

789
00:52:29,829 --> 00:52:32,578
If there is anything, it must be the palate,

790
00:52:32,578 --> 00:52:38,421
memory and touch of this Transcendent Genius.

791
00:52:40,391 --> 00:52:43,648
With such talent

792
00:52:43,648 --> 00:52:46,639
why waste it in a rundown diner

793
00:52:47,597 --> 00:52:50,896
with no customers?

794
00:52:50,896 --> 00:52:54,024
Just look at yourself.

795
00:52:54,024 --> 00:52:58,495
A man as full of life as you,
wasting away for the rest of his days

796
00:52:59,359 --> 00:53:02,490
locked in a house
without even a single window?

797
00:53:04,512 --> 00:53:06,215
What's the matter?

798
00:53:08,510 --> 00:53:10,451
Nothing.

799
00:53:10,451 --> 00:53:14,121
After a few drinks,
you seem to resemble my friend even more.

800
00:53:14,855 --> 00:53:16,411
Is that so?

801
00:53:17,859 --> 00:53:19,470
I...

802
00:53:20,272 --> 00:53:22,383
don't look that old, do I?

803
00:53:23,641 --> 00:53:25,381
It's strange, isn't it?

804
00:53:27,086 --> 00:53:29,292
You are not my man

805
00:53:29,292 --> 00:53:31,681
but you are just like him.

806
00:53:33,590 --> 00:53:39,267
The dignitary wishes to showcase
authentic Korean flavors to the state guests.

807
00:53:57,702 --> 00:54:01,048
Leave that diner

808
00:54:02,050 --> 00:54:04,354
and join me.

809
00:54:05,081 --> 00:54:10,744
I'll turn you into the finest Korean chef.

810
00:54:10,744 --> 00:54:12,238
Pardon?

811
00:54:14,364 --> 00:54:16,781
You have quite the sense of humor
when you're drunk.

812
00:54:19,249 --> 00:54:23,515
I have always been anything but humorous.

813
00:54:23,515 --> 00:54:28,161
Have I ever been anything but serious?

814
00:54:30,978 --> 00:54:33,088
It's been a while since I drank

815
00:54:33,864 --> 00:54:35,913
and it's really getting to me.

816
00:54:37,610 --> 00:54:40,153
I should call it a day.

817
00:54:40,153 --> 00:54:42,205
This is a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity.

818
00:54:43,313 --> 00:54:45,909
Are you content to stay

819
00:54:45,909 --> 00:54:49,166
in that shabby diner
for the rest of your days?

820
00:54:49,166 --> 00:54:50,649
Then,

821
00:54:51,624 --> 00:54:55,353
are you content to live like this
for the rest of your days?

822
00:54:56,193 --> 00:54:57,938
Gwansong.

823
00:54:59,345 --> 00:55:01,631
I missed you.

824
00:55:07,221 --> 00:55:11,793
This will guide Mr. Homeless
even on the darkest nights.

825
00:55:13,052 --> 00:55:15,286
Let's work together.

826
00:55:15,286 --> 00:55:18,433
I'll give you the best possible offer.
