Who is Chef Lee Hyuk?

12
00:00:36,301 --> 00:00:38,680
Recognized for his exceptional
culinary talent from an early age

13
00:00:38,680 --> 00:00:40,957
he set his sights high and trained

14
00:00:40,957 --> 00:00:46,060
at the renowned CAA in Switzerland
and Le Cordon Bleu in France.

15
00:00:46,060 --> 00:00:49,562
Afterward, he became a professor at
a prestigious culinary university in Japan.

16
00:00:50,221 --> 00:00:54,255
However, driven by a sense of duty
to promote Korean cuisine, he returned.

17
00:00:54,255 --> 00:00:58,028
And, within just three years,
he became the youngest Korean Master Chef!

18
00:00:58,028 --> 00:01:03,572
He then went on to sweep awards at
numerous international culinary competitions.

19
00:01:06,645 --> 00:01:10,968
Most recently, in his ambition to introduce
a wider variety of dishes to more people

20
00:01:10,968 --> 00:01:15,157
he opened Dorae, a fine dining
Korean restaurant in Seongbuk-dong.

21
00:01:17,952 --> 00:01:20,435
And has been thriving ever since.

22
00:01:23,108 --> 00:01:24,734
Do you get it now?

23
00:01:24,734 --> 00:01:28,463
Chef Lee Hyuk is an incredible person.

24
00:01:28,463 --> 00:01:32,081
Not someone a random homeless man
like you would know.

25
00:01:32,081 --> 00:01:34,874
Are you truly not Gwansong?

26
00:01:37,944 --> 00:01:39,864
But you look exactly like him!

27
00:01:39,864 --> 00:01:42,803
Do you not recognize me?

28
00:01:42,803 --> 00:01:44,721
I'm Gyosan.

29
00:01:46,085 --> 00:01:47,929
I don't.

30
00:01:47,929 --> 00:01:49,870
I don't believe we've ever met before.

31
00:01:49,870 --> 00:01:51,565
No...

32
00:01:51,565 --> 00:01:54,880
You've yet to come to your senses.

33
00:01:54,880 --> 00:01:58,688
You should head inside, Chef Lee
I'll handle this.

34
00:01:58,688 --> 00:02:00,299
You should come inside with me

35
00:02:00,299 --> 00:02:02,887
I'll have the staff take care of him.

36
00:02:02,887 --> 00:02:06,240
No, I'm an expert at dealing with
these types of people.

37
00:02:06,240 --> 00:02:07,920
But still...

38
00:02:07,920 --> 00:02:12,107
Going inside is the best way to help,
so go inside if you want to help.

39
00:02:12,107 --> 00:02:13,692
Quick.

40
00:02:13,692 --> 00:02:16,117
Wait, Gwansong!

41
00:02:16,117 --> 00:02:17,228
Please step aside.

42
00:02:17,228 --> 00:02:19,482
- Gwansong! It's me!
- Hey!

43
00:02:19,482 --> 00:02:22,516
I'm Gyosan, a friend
who passed the state exams with you!

44
00:02:22,516 --> 00:02:24,738
Why don't you recognize me?

45
00:02:26,523 --> 00:02:29,524
I have no idea who you're mistaking him for

46
00:02:29,524 --> 00:02:33,428
but do you think faces like his are common?

47
00:02:33,428 --> 00:02:36,831
Do you know how rare it is
to be that good-looking?

48
00:02:36,831 --> 00:02:41,758
And clearly, he looks way too young
for you two to have taken the exam together.

49
00:02:43,558 --> 00:02:46,826
Perhaps I was mistaken after all…

50
00:02:46,826 --> 00:02:48,190
Good.

51
00:02:48,190 --> 00:02:50,581
Now that you understand, please leave.

52
00:02:52,515 --> 00:02:55,274
Then let me at least apologize in person!

53
00:02:55,274 --> 00:02:58,056
Oh, come on!

54
00:02:58,056 --> 00:02:59,479
What did you eat to be this strong?

55
00:02:59,479 --> 00:03:03,472
Mister, did you bring the money?

56
00:03:03,472 --> 00:03:06,311
The money for your meal.

57
00:03:10,994 --> 00:03:13,774
I figured as much.

58
00:03:13,774 --> 00:03:16,504
From the moment you left this as a "collateral"...

59
00:03:16,504 --> 00:03:19,045
I knew you were a runner.

60
00:03:19,045 --> 00:03:21,794
But I just didn't expect you to come back.

61
00:03:21,794 --> 00:03:24,944
A runner? What's that?

62
00:03:24,944 --> 00:03:26,907
Someone who eats and runs. Like you.

63
00:03:26,907 --> 00:03:28,831
How rude! Runs?!

64
00:03:28,831 --> 00:03:31,216
What an undignified accusation!

65
00:03:31,216 --> 00:03:33,995
I'm no shameless freeloader.

66
00:03:33,995 --> 00:03:38,085
I may not have money right now.

67
00:03:39,847 --> 00:03:42,232
Is there a stream nearby?

68
00:03:42,232 --> 00:03:44,643
I'll catch some fish and repay my debt!

69
00:03:47,995 --> 00:03:50,234
Mr. Homeless.

70
00:03:50,234 --> 00:03:54,036
Forget the money
Just stay away from here.

71
00:03:54,036 --> 00:03:55,074
Understood?

72
00:03:55,074 --> 00:03:58,050
Why did you put that there?

73
00:03:58,050 --> 00:03:59,793
Domundaejak is not a book
to be tossed aside like rubbish!

74
00:03:59,793 --> 00:04:01,203
If you show up here again

75
00:04:01,203 --> 00:04:04,446
I'll report you for dining and dashing, okay?

76
00:04:10,651 --> 00:04:13,243
What brings you here at this hour?

77
00:04:14,187 --> 00:04:16,411
I was working out of the office.

78
00:04:18,629 --> 00:04:21,488
- I'm serious.
- Ma'am, can we get more kimchi?

79
00:04:21,488 --> 00:04:23,071
Perfect, help me out.

80
00:04:23,071 --> 00:04:25,303
Take this to that table over there.

81
00:04:25,303 --> 00:04:28,156
Didn't you say
you'd handle the diner yourself?

82
00:04:32,581 --> 00:04:35,608
Apologies, but I'm taking this back.

83
00:04:41,490 --> 00:04:43,338
Excuse me, young lady.

84
00:04:45,093 --> 00:04:49,159
This book I gave you is not something
to be treated so carelessly.

85
00:04:49,159 --> 00:04:52,631
This transcendent genius,
Heo Gyun, wrote about food for the first...

86
00:04:55,465 --> 00:04:58,579
Wait, what is this scent!?

87
00:05:00,026 --> 00:05:01,962
You're back.

88
00:05:03,157 --> 00:05:05,640
The aroma of cheonggukjang
is more fragrant than flowers.

89
00:05:05,640 --> 00:05:07,237
You must be hungry.

90
00:05:07,237 --> 00:05:09,026
But I'm afraid you'll have to wait.

91
00:05:09,026 --> 00:05:11,500
There are many customers ahead of you.

92
00:05:13,881 --> 00:05:16,117
This guy is unbelievable.

93
00:05:16,117 --> 00:05:19,806
Didn't I tell you not to show up here again?

94
00:05:19,806 --> 00:05:21,604
Do I sound like a joke to you?

95
00:05:21,604 --> 00:05:23,184
That's enough!

96
00:05:23,184 --> 00:05:26,222
If you're not helping,
go upstairs and don't add to the chaos.

97
00:05:26,222 --> 00:05:28,773
Mister, come back another time, okay?

98
00:05:28,773 --> 00:05:30,499
Come back?

99
00:05:32,407 --> 00:05:34,299
Try showing up here again

100
00:05:34,299 --> 00:05:36,803
and I swear I'll report you! Okay?

101
00:05:37,855 --> 00:05:40,926
Oh, for heaven's sake,
that's enough already.

102
00:05:52,689 --> 00:05:54,388
It's all saved.

103
00:05:59,145 --> 00:06:01,853
Excuse me, where's our food?

104
00:06:01,853 --> 00:06:04,027
Coming right up!

105
00:06:09,605 --> 00:06:11,615
Stop pestering her.

106
00:06:11,615 --> 00:06:13,617
Can't you see she's busy?

107
00:06:15,846 --> 00:06:18,218
I thought only Joseon people were impatient

108
00:06:18,218 --> 00:06:20,718
but Yuldoguk is no different.

109
00:06:20,718 --> 00:06:23,428
Why don't you lend a hand?

110
00:06:23,428 --> 00:06:24,601
I'll even pay you for it.

111
00:06:24,601 --> 00:06:27,092
Mom!

112
00:06:27,092 --> 00:06:29,077
Mom, go inside.

113
00:06:29,711 --> 00:06:33,052
I am of noble birth. Such labor is beneath me.

114
00:06:33,052 --> 00:06:34,475
Excuse me?

115
00:06:34,475 --> 00:06:37,667
So you're saying people
like my mom are lowborns?

116
00:06:37,667 --> 00:06:41,390
No, I simply meant that nobles and commoners
have different roles in society

117
00:06:41,390 --> 00:06:45,599
and since I've never done such work,
I'd only be a burden.

118
00:06:45,599 --> 00:06:47,431
Please do not take offense.

119
00:06:48,368 --> 00:06:51,507
Wow, I never thought
I'd be bossed around by a homeless guy.

120
00:06:52,334 --> 00:06:56,201
Keep talking like that and you'll be "poof".

121
00:06:56,201 --> 00:06:58,609
Gone before you know it.

122
00:06:58,609 --> 00:07:00,614
- Poof?
- Poof!

123
00:07:00,614 --> 00:07:04,499
Are you saying that in Yuldoguk,
even nobles can do this kind of work?

124
00:07:04,499 --> 00:07:05,813
No, they can't.

125
00:07:05,813 --> 00:07:06,941
See?

126
00:07:06,941 --> 00:07:09,980
Because there are no nobles.

127
00:07:13,249 --> 00:07:18,021
There are no class distinctions.
Everyone earns their living by working.

128
00:07:20,220 --> 00:07:23,072
No wonder you're still wandering around.

129
00:07:26,654 --> 00:07:31,990
So, it's not forbidding discrimination…
The very concept doesn't exist here?

130
00:07:31,990 --> 00:07:33,933
I always thought of myself
as open-minded, but…

131
00:07:33,933 --> 00:07:36,924
That never even crossed my mind.

132
00:07:37,554 --> 00:07:42,783
Yuldoguk truly surpasses
my wildest imagination.

133
00:07:44,758 --> 00:07:46,546
Stop right there.

134
00:07:46,546 --> 00:07:49,071
From this moment,
anyone who isn't working or eating

135
00:07:49,071 --> 00:07:51,750
needs to leave this diner.

136
00:07:51,750 --> 00:07:53,054
One.

137
00:07:53,054 --> 00:07:54,831
Two

138
00:07:56,728 --> 00:07:58,702
I'll do my best.

139
00:08:04,710 --> 00:08:07,607
This belonged to Eun Sil's late father,
and it fits you perfectly.

140
00:08:10,569 --> 00:08:12,755
Now, put on this apron.

141
00:08:23,950 --> 00:08:26,879
Make use of your hands

142
00:08:26,879 --> 00:08:28,813
and take them yourselves.

143
00:08:30,870 --> 00:08:32,772
I'm sorry.

144
00:08:42,819 --> 00:08:45,097
That's my credit card...

145
00:08:45,097 --> 00:08:47,174
But you gave it to me.

146
00:08:49,108 --> 00:08:51,201
I'm sorry.

147
00:08:51,942 --> 00:08:53,757
Hurry and hand it over.

148
00:09:01,061 --> 00:09:02,928
What's this?

149
00:09:06,761 --> 00:09:09,027
Why is there cold air inside?

150
00:09:09,027 --> 00:09:12,048
Mister, come over here.

151
00:09:12,048 --> 00:09:14,650
Wait, what are you doing?

152
00:09:22,715 --> 00:09:24,685
- Last dish.
- Yes, Chef!

153
00:09:24,685 --> 00:09:26,177
No more customers after this.

154
00:09:26,177 --> 00:09:28,198
I have an important meeting.

155
00:09:49,045 --> 00:09:51,242
Had a course meal at Dorae for lunch.

156
00:09:51,242 --> 00:09:53,761
The flavors and presentation are
as flawless as Chef Lee Hyuk himself.

157
00:09:53,761 --> 00:09:57,254
Beautiful, but ridiculously expensive!
My wallet is in shambles.

158
00:09:57,254 --> 00:09:58,456
Have you tried the diner across?
Super cost-efficient.

159
00:09:58,456 --> 00:09:59,708
The set meals there are amazing.

160
00:09:59,708 --> 00:10:01,751
It's 60 times cheaper than Dorae? Unreal.

161
00:10:01,751 --> 00:10:05,470
No wonder there's always a line.
I'm going next week.

162
00:10:11,098 --> 00:10:14,368
I struck him down without a doubt...

163
00:10:15,009 --> 00:10:17,595
but he vanished without a trace.

164
00:10:17,595 --> 00:10:19,462
Vanished?

165
00:10:20,936 --> 00:10:24,122
And you expect me to believe that?

166
00:10:24,829 --> 00:10:28,940
Even I could hardly believe it myself.

167
00:10:28,940 --> 00:10:31,602
It was as if I were bewitched…

168
00:10:33,024 --> 00:10:35,907
As if you were bewitched?

169
00:10:42,223 --> 00:10:46,574
So, you drove this blade
straight into Gyosan's neck?

170
00:10:46,574 --> 00:10:50,134
I am certain of it.

171
00:10:50,134 --> 00:10:53,219
Unless I see it with my own eyes...

172
00:10:53,219 --> 00:10:56,019
I cannot trust such words.

173
00:10:58,595 --> 00:11:05,451
But if I kill you now,
I'll never find Gyosan.

174
00:11:09,303 --> 00:11:11,318
So bring him to me.

175
00:11:11,318 --> 00:11:15,671
His body, his remains...
Find something.

176
00:11:17,190 --> 00:11:19,301
If you fail…

177
00:11:22,282 --> 00:11:25,307
You'll prove with your own neck

178
00:11:25,307 --> 00:11:30,200
how a dead man vanished without a trace.

179
00:11:30,200 --> 00:11:32,023
Yes, My Lord.

180
00:11:47,838 --> 00:11:51,121
Indeed, a goblin he is...

181
00:11:53,015 --> 00:11:58,370
To take a blade to the neck
and simply disappear.

182
00:12:04,259 --> 00:12:07,232
What's wrong?
Something stuck in your throat?

183
00:12:08,732 --> 00:12:11,067
It's so delicious.

184
00:12:11,067 --> 00:12:14,052
I don't want to share it
even with my own throat.

185
00:12:14,052 --> 00:12:17,054
You sure have a way with words.

186
00:12:20,544 --> 00:12:23,513
Maybe it's because I worked today,
but the food tastes even more divine.

187
00:12:23,513 --> 00:12:27,708
As expected, this Transcendent Genius,
Heo Gyun, is truly a master of all trades!

188
00:12:32,846 --> 00:12:36,587
What is that hideous smell
before such precious food?

189
00:12:36,587 --> 00:12:38,114
Hideous?

190
00:12:38,114 --> 00:12:40,306
This is Channel No.5.

191
00:12:40,306 --> 00:12:42,395
I splurged on this, okay?

192
00:12:43,096 --> 00:12:44,407
Mom, I'm heading out.

193
00:12:44,407 --> 00:12:45,846
Eat before you go.

194
00:12:45,846 --> 00:12:48,993
Since when have I ever eaten cheonggukjang?

195
00:12:50,053 --> 00:12:53,196
You never eat anything good for you.

196
00:13:00,167 --> 00:13:02,696
Here's your pay for today.

197
00:13:02,696 --> 00:13:04,357
Your share for today's work.

198
00:13:13,331 --> 00:13:15,875
Hang on, let me do a quick audit.

199
00:13:15,875 --> 00:13:17,367
Weren't you leaving?

200
00:13:17,367 --> 00:13:19,218
I knew it.

201
00:13:19,218 --> 00:13:21,786
Why is the hourly rate so high?

202
00:13:21,786 --> 00:13:23,422
Let's see.

203
00:13:23,422 --> 00:13:26,603
A total newbie worked six hours.

204
00:13:26,603 --> 00:13:29,023
So minimum wage times six...

205
00:13:31,344 --> 00:13:33,258
Then subtract three servings of gukbap
from yesterday

206
00:13:33,258 --> 00:13:34,745
two servings of cheonggukjang today...

207
00:13:34,745 --> 00:13:37,343
and the dish you broke...

208
00:13:39,238 --> 00:13:41,845
That leaves this much.

209
00:13:41,845 --> 00:13:43,904
Is this Yuldoguk's currency?

210
00:13:43,904 --> 00:13:47,249
Hey, are you the owner here?
Give it back.

211
00:13:48,342 --> 00:13:51,624
You're not helping
by spoiling him like this.

212
00:13:51,624 --> 00:13:55,043
He already has trouble
distinguishing fantasy from reality.

213
00:13:55,043 --> 00:13:57,568
You might be reinforcing his delusions.

214
00:13:57,568 --> 00:14:00,349
You always think you're right.

215
00:14:00,349 --> 00:14:02,036
Wait.

216
00:14:02,036 --> 00:14:04,933
Is this person wearing gonryongpo?

217
00:14:04,933 --> 00:14:08,687
Why does Yuldoguk's currency
bear a Joseon royal portrait?

218
00:14:08,687 --> 00:14:10,100
Of course, it does.

219
00:14:10,100 --> 00:14:12,463
That's Sejong the Great!

220
00:14:13,779 --> 00:14:15,733
I failed to recognize His Highness

221
00:14:15,733 --> 00:14:18,762
I humbly implore your gracious understanding!

222
00:14:19,779 --> 00:14:22,029
That's just too much to handle.

223
00:14:22,029 --> 00:14:23,100
Give it back to him before you go.

224
00:14:23,100 --> 00:14:25,422
Hey, hey, hey, hey! Give it!

225
00:14:28,321 --> 00:14:30,056
I'm going.

226
00:14:31,738 --> 00:14:34,321
I humbly implore
your gracious understanding!

227
00:14:39,356 --> 00:14:40,959
This belongs to you, right?

228
00:14:40,959 --> 00:14:42,561
Yes.

229
00:14:45,875 --> 00:14:49,756
I'm usually not this careless, you know

230
00:14:49,756 --> 00:14:52,065
but I was so distracted earlier

231
00:14:52,065 --> 00:14:54,404
I can't believe I left these behind.

232
00:14:54,404 --> 00:14:56,723
By the way, are you okay?

233
00:14:56,723 --> 00:14:59,092
You must've been surprised.

234
00:14:59,092 --> 00:15:02,598
But thanks to you, I'm fine.

235
00:15:07,011 --> 00:15:10,138
Can I call you by your name, Eun Sil?

236
00:15:12,734 --> 00:15:15,855
I didn't expect you to know my name.

237
00:15:15,855 --> 00:15:17,788
Call me all you want.

238
00:15:19,507 --> 00:15:25,101
Well, you seem to know all about my career.

239
00:15:26,142 --> 00:15:27,859
Well...

240
00:15:31,408 --> 00:15:33,086
I was pleased.

241
00:15:33,086 --> 00:15:35,374
And thank you for helping me

242
00:15:35,374 --> 00:15:37,365
when I was in difficult situation.

243
00:15:37,365 --> 00:15:41,739
Oh, it was nothing.

244
00:15:41,739 --> 00:15:44,859
That's just what neighbors do.

245
00:15:56,313 --> 00:15:59,177
Speaking of neighbors

246
00:15:59,177 --> 00:16:04,299
I'd rather not have
dangerous people roaming around here.

247
00:16:04,299 --> 00:16:06,163
My thoughts exactly.

248
00:16:06,163 --> 00:16:10,877
How do you and I think so much alike?

249
00:16:12,579 --> 00:16:14,235
To make that happen

250
00:16:14,235 --> 00:16:19,672
I believe this neighborhood needs
a touch of refinement.

251
00:16:19,672 --> 00:16:21,559
Refinement.

252
00:16:22,240 --> 00:16:23,989
That's right.

253
00:16:30,543 --> 00:16:32,697
Eun Sil.

254
00:16:32,697 --> 00:16:37,254
Have you ever heard of
the Broken Window Theory?

255
00:16:38,364 --> 00:16:40,374
If a broken window is left unattended

256
00:16:40,374 --> 00:16:43,286
the whole area eventually turns into a slum.

257
00:16:43,286 --> 00:16:44,588
Right?

258
00:16:44,588 --> 00:16:49,148
I don't think we should...

259
00:16:49,148 --> 00:16:53,221
let that broken window fester here.

260
00:16:54,073 --> 00:16:56,204
I completely agree.

261
00:16:58,968 --> 00:17:02,336
Has your mother mentioned anything?

262
00:17:03,360 --> 00:17:05,642
My mom?

263
00:17:05,642 --> 00:17:07,731
About what?

264
00:17:10,027 --> 00:17:11,816
It's nothing.

265
00:17:21,201 --> 00:17:25,583
I'll give you about a week to think it over.

266
00:17:25,583 --> 00:17:29,446
There's nothing to think about.

267
00:17:30,221 --> 00:17:33,225
The price I'm offering
is far above market value.

268
00:17:33,225 --> 00:17:39,081
With this money, you could open
a much bigger restaurant somewhere else.

269
00:17:39,081 --> 00:17:42,765
A bigger restaurant just means more work.

270
00:17:42,765 --> 00:17:46,465
And why would I leave my own place
to go somewhere else?

271
00:17:47,921 --> 00:17:52,903
I'll double the price I've just offered you.

272
00:17:52,903 --> 00:17:54,893
You really are persistent.

273
00:17:54,893 --> 00:17:57,472
I told you, it's not about the money.

274
00:17:57,472 --> 00:18:00,812
What exactly do you plan to do
with this rundown little diner?

275
00:18:02,190 --> 00:18:05,387
I intend to open a Korean dessert café.

276
00:18:05,387 --> 00:18:08,069
My goal is to turn this entire area into

277
00:18:08,069 --> 00:18:10,978
a high-end Korean cuisine-themed village.

278
00:18:10,978 --> 00:18:14,987
Every other store
has already been secured.

279
00:18:14,987 --> 00:18:19,345
This diner is the only one left.

280
00:18:19,345 --> 00:18:23,181
And what about the people who eat here?

281
00:18:25,138 --> 00:18:27,406
Some of my regulars rely on this place

282
00:18:27,406 --> 00:18:30,698
because they have nowhere else to go.

283
00:18:32,032 --> 00:18:35,564
Does it have to be this exact spot?

284
00:18:35,564 --> 00:18:37,316
You could serve the same meals elsewhere…

285
00:18:37,316 --> 00:18:39,830
But doesn't that apply to you, too?

286
00:18:39,830 --> 00:18:43,978
Why do you insist on having it here?

287
00:18:46,978 --> 00:18:48,850
Look, I get it.

288
00:18:48,850 --> 00:18:51,172
I feel bad about getting in the way
of a young person

289
00:18:51,172 --> 00:18:54,519
trying to make something of themselves.

290
00:18:55,667 --> 00:18:57,847
So, I'll think about it.

291
00:18:57,847 --> 00:19:00,500
But don't get your hopes up.

292
00:19:00,500 --> 00:19:05,323
I have my own reasons
for wanting to hold on to this place.

293
00:19:29,619 --> 00:19:33,062
So she hasn't even told her daughter…

294
00:19:34,661 --> 00:19:37,104
Does this mean it's a no?

295
00:19:42,920 --> 00:19:47,603
But why does Yuldoguk's currency
bear the portrait of Sejong the Great?

296
00:19:47,603 --> 00:19:51,870
Because he's a respected figure.

297
00:19:51,870 --> 00:19:56,013
His achievements have spread
even to Yuldoguk?

298
00:19:56,013 --> 00:20:00,027
What kind of king does this land have
to hold such noble admiration?

299
00:20:00,027 --> 00:20:02,691
There are no kings anymore.

300
00:20:04,980 --> 00:20:09,915
No kings, no nobles, no commoners…
yet everything functions so seamlessly.

301
00:20:09,915 --> 00:20:13,437
I think I'm growing even fonder of Yuldoguk.

302
00:20:13,437 --> 00:20:15,485
Good.

303
00:20:15,485 --> 00:20:18,345
Then why not settle down here?

304
00:20:19,562 --> 00:20:21,846
That won't do.

305
00:20:22,493 --> 00:20:25,037
There's a saying that
one must never forget their roots.

306
00:20:25,037 --> 00:20:29,469
Even animals turn toward home
in their final moments.

307
00:20:29,469 --> 00:20:30,979
No matter how much I admire Yuldoguk

308
00:20:30,979 --> 00:20:33,868
I must return to Joseon,
where my family and friends await.

309
00:20:33,868 --> 00:20:35,739
Wouldn't you agree?

310
00:20:37,299 --> 00:20:41,380
I'll go back and tell the world
how remarkable this place is.

311
00:20:41,380 --> 00:20:44,271
If Joseon could advance like Yuldoguk

312
00:20:44,271 --> 00:20:46,597
our people would suffer far less.

313
00:20:49,669 --> 00:20:54,481
Speaking of which, how much does
one of those Seobinggo cost?

314
00:20:55,509 --> 00:20:57,579
The refrigerator?

315
00:20:57,579 --> 00:21:01,735
Well, the latest models
go for at least 3 million won.

316
00:21:01,735 --> 00:21:03,826
Three million?

317
00:21:03,826 --> 00:21:06,771
That means I'd need 300 portraits
of His Highness to afford one?!

318
00:21:06,771 --> 00:21:09,628
You'll earn that in no time if you work hard.

319
00:21:09,628 --> 00:21:12,915
If you've got nowhere to go,
why don't you work here?

320
00:21:12,915 --> 00:21:14,566
- Mom!
- Oh, geez!

321
00:21:14,566 --> 00:21:15,631
When did you get here?

322
00:21:15,631 --> 00:21:17,445
Are you out of your mind?

323
00:21:17,445 --> 00:21:20,652
You're letting a man with no background
and questionable sanity work here?!

324
00:21:24,441 --> 00:21:28,111
I bit my tongue once today,
but I can't hold back anymore.

325
00:21:28,111 --> 00:21:31,296
Choose.
Is it me or that homeless man?

326
00:21:36,629 --> 00:21:39,358
Wait, what's that?

327
00:21:43,678 --> 00:21:47,146
Did you...
You quit your job again, didn't you?

328
00:21:48,179 --> 00:21:50,203
- That's not it.
- Get out.

329
00:21:50,203 --> 00:21:51,366
- Get out, get out.
- Mom!

330
00:21:51,366 --> 00:21:53,256
Go live however you want!

331
00:22:02,839 --> 00:22:04,232
Young lady.

332
00:22:04,232 --> 00:22:07,840
Madam wants you to return the money
you stashed away earlier.

333
00:22:10,705 --> 00:22:14,443
Tell her I wish her all the best
after chasing her only daughter out.

334
00:22:14,443 --> 00:22:16,156
Got it.

335
00:22:19,117 --> 00:22:20,991
- Young lady!
- What?

336
00:22:20,991 --> 00:22:23,937
Tell her it's too late to stop me.

337
00:22:23,937 --> 00:22:27,053
She says 5,000 won is missing.

338
00:22:31,256 --> 00:22:32,793
Happy now?

339
00:22:32,793 --> 00:22:35,129
Now it's settled. Take care.

340
00:22:39,794 --> 00:22:42,485
Lastly, the site for the Korean dessert café

341
00:22:42,485 --> 00:22:44,845
will replace an old diner

342
00:22:44,845 --> 00:22:47,979
with a newly constructed
four-story glass-walled building.

343
00:22:47,979 --> 00:22:52,933
This will serve as an observatory
overlooking the entire themed village.

344
00:22:52,933 --> 00:22:54,590
Mr. Lee.

345
00:22:56,588 --> 00:22:58,642
Mr. Lee?

346
00:22:58,642 --> 00:22:59,775
Yes?

347
00:22:59,775 --> 00:23:02,808
I asked about the café contract status.

348
00:23:02,808 --> 00:23:04,416
It will be finalized soon.

349
00:23:04,416 --> 00:23:07,108
Didn't you say it would be done by today?

350
00:23:09,019 --> 00:23:12,072
I apologize.
I'll wrap it up as quickly as possible.

351
00:23:12,072 --> 00:23:16,070
That diner, the one at the café site,
seems to be quite a hidden gem.

352
00:23:16,070 --> 00:23:18,711
It doesn't even have a sign,
but there's always a line of customers.

353
00:23:18,711 --> 00:23:21,516
I doubt they'd want to sell.

354
00:23:21,516 --> 00:23:25,368
You should give us immediate updates
if it seems unlikely.

355
00:23:25,368 --> 00:23:27,672
We're relying on you,
but we're just wasting time at this point.

356
00:23:27,672 --> 00:23:31,141
I said it would be done.

357
00:23:37,708 --> 00:23:41,292
So please, leave
the contract negotiations to me

358
00:23:41,292 --> 00:23:43,978
and let's move on to reviewing
other agenda items.

359
00:23:47,791 --> 00:23:51,731
Have we finalized
the promotional model for advertising?

360
00:24:10,121 --> 00:24:12,695
Okay, nice.

361
00:24:12,695 --> 00:24:15,451
Let's take a two-shot with our new model.

362
00:24:16,601 --> 00:24:19,958
Excuse me, the other cast is coming through.

363
00:24:21,036 --> 00:24:22,716
Other cast?

364
00:24:22,716 --> 00:24:24,760
Yes, sir.

365
00:24:24,760 --> 00:24:28,071
We'll make sure to adjust
our schedule accordingly.

366
00:24:28,071 --> 00:24:30,878
- No problem.
- Hey!

367
00:24:33,496 --> 00:24:35,670
Why didn't you tell me?

368
00:24:35,670 --> 00:24:39,545
Why didn't you tell me
this was my last commercial?

369
00:24:39,545 --> 00:24:43,765
If you had known, you wouldn't have done it.

370
00:24:43,765 --> 00:24:45,170
This is unbelievable.

371
00:24:45,170 --> 00:24:48,352
They're dropping me
for some no-name old hag?

372
00:24:48,352 --> 00:24:50,343
Don't you know who she is?

373
00:24:50,343 --> 00:24:54,160
She just won the Best Actress at Cannes.

374
00:24:54,160 --> 00:24:56,175
Seriously?

375
00:24:56,175 --> 00:24:59,380
Mi Sol, you are the no-name here.

376
00:24:59,380 --> 00:25:01,037
Kids these days don't know who you are

377
00:25:01,037 --> 00:25:03,470
since they never saw you back in your prime.

378
00:25:03,470 --> 00:25:05,587
You need to start taking adult roles.

379
00:25:05,587 --> 00:25:08,734
How long are you going to rely on
your childhood fame to shoot commercials?

380
00:25:08,734 --> 00:25:11,173
It's not like I haven't tried!

381
00:25:11,173 --> 00:25:14,963
Every time I do, I become a meme
for my awful acting.

382
00:25:17,518 --> 00:25:19,174
[Even tearing paper feels dull.]
Why am I the only one having a hard time?

383
00:25:19,174 --> 00:25:20,292
[This is hard for me, too.]
Why!

384
00:25:20,292 --> 00:25:21,974
[Great volume, terrible acting.]
Why!

385
00:25:21,974 --> 00:25:23,414
[Ugh, so loud.]

386
00:25:23,414 --> 00:25:25,949
[Is she gargling?]

387
00:25:25,949 --> 00:25:29,255
[A pterosaur has entered the scene.]

388
00:25:31,246 --> 00:25:35,128
[Definitely not crying.]

389
00:25:35,128 --> 00:25:38,893
[Even her grabbing looks awkward.]
Young Master, don't abandon me.

390
00:25:38,893 --> 00:25:42,194
[Just abandon her.]

391
00:25:42,194 --> 00:25:47,434
[What a diction, BOO. HOO. HOO.]

392
00:25:47,434 --> 00:25:51,978
[Where is she suddenly looking?]

393
00:25:51,978 --> 00:25:53,708
[Even Mi Sol would cry watching this.]

394
00:25:53,708 --> 00:25:55,431
My father.

395
00:25:55,431 --> 00:25:56,574
Bring him back!

396
00:25:56,574 --> 00:25:58,634
[Bring this drama back to life.]

397
00:25:58,634 --> 00:26:02,919
[Why is she always looking off into the distance?]

398
00:26:02,919 --> 00:26:05,880
[Whoa, why did she suddenly start smiling?]

399
00:26:05,880 --> 00:26:07,597
[What on earth am I watching?]

400
00:26:07,597 --> 00:26:10,832
Other than your crying scenes,
you're not that bad.

401
00:26:10,832 --> 00:26:12,450
Let's work on it.

402
00:26:12,450 --> 00:26:14,169
Forget it.

403
00:26:14,169 --> 00:26:16,090
Just get me another cosmetics commercial.

404
00:26:16,090 --> 00:26:20,179
A higher-end brand than this one.

405
00:26:20,179 --> 00:26:24,468
You're not in a position to be picky anymore.

406
00:26:25,220 --> 00:26:27,608
Nonsense! I'm Jung Mi Sol, the CF fairy!

407
00:26:27,608 --> 00:26:30,098
Ever since I was five years old!

408
00:26:34,254 --> 00:26:37,004
If you want to keep doing commercials,
take a look at this.

409
00:26:37,004 --> 00:26:39,120
What's this?

410
00:26:40,617 --> 00:26:42,925
What? A restaurant commercial?

411
00:26:42,925 --> 00:26:46,636
Not just any restaurant,
a fine dining establishment.

412
00:26:46,636 --> 00:26:49,230
Same thing.

413
00:26:50,099 --> 00:26:51,367
I don't do food ads.

414
00:26:51,367 --> 00:26:52,961
Why not?

415
00:26:55,881 --> 00:26:57,849
Because I'll gain weight!

416
00:26:57,849 --> 00:26:59,593
I'll have to be in shape!

417
00:26:59,593 --> 00:27:02,758
Do you think it's easy
to maintain how I look?

418
00:27:02,758 --> 00:27:05,276
So you don't want dramas
because you'll get roasted for bad acting

419
00:27:05,276 --> 00:27:06,624
and you don't want ads
because you might gain weight…

420
00:27:06,624 --> 00:27:08,840
Then what exactly do you want to do?

421
00:27:13,677 --> 00:27:15,756
Maybe I should just get married.

422
00:27:15,756 --> 00:27:17,548
Got any decent guys around?

423
00:27:17,548 --> 00:27:19,584
Hey, Jung Mi Sol!

424
00:27:19,584 --> 00:27:22,172
I'm warning you Pick one.

425
00:27:22,172 --> 00:27:24,712
A drama or an ad.

426
00:27:45,691 --> 00:27:47,691
Ah, you startled me!

427
00:27:47,691 --> 00:27:49,790
Who are you?

428
00:27:49,790 --> 00:27:51,858
How did you get in here?

429
00:27:53,927 --> 00:27:56,017
The door was opened.

430
00:27:58,191 --> 00:28:01,225
Oh, don't be alarmed.

431
00:28:01,225 --> 00:28:04,218
I came to apologize for earlier today.

432
00:28:04,218 --> 00:28:07,018
You resemble someone I know so closely

433
00:28:07,018 --> 00:28:10,419
that I mistook you for him
and acted discourteously.

434
00:28:10,419 --> 00:28:13,548
Of course, Gwansong wouldn't be here.

435
00:28:13,548 --> 00:28:16,948
I must have been confused,
being in a foreign place.

436
00:28:17,680 --> 00:28:19,417
Get out.

437
00:28:21,793 --> 00:28:24,029
I said get out now.

438
00:28:24,879 --> 00:28:26,365
That's no way to treat someone

439
00:28:26,365 --> 00:28:28,640
offering an apology.

440
00:28:30,632 --> 00:28:34,084
I don't need your apology.

441
00:28:34,084 --> 00:28:36,484
Just don't ever come back.

442
00:28:37,256 --> 00:28:42,014
I was already planning to return
to where I came from.

443
00:28:42,702 --> 00:28:45,775
So you won't have to worry about
seeing me again.

444
00:28:46,447 --> 00:28:49,757
Regardless, I regret the misunderstanding.

445
00:28:54,061 --> 00:28:55,850
Wait, this is...

446
00:28:57,762 --> 00:29:00,361
This is Mae Chang!

447
00:29:00,361 --> 00:29:03,586
Does that mean Mae Chang is here as well?

448
00:29:04,435 --> 00:29:07,799
Then, as expected...

449
00:29:09,664 --> 00:29:11,323
You are Gwansong!

450
00:29:11,968 --> 00:29:13,727
It is you, Gwansong!

451
00:29:13,727 --> 00:29:14,969
Why are you pretending not to know me?

452
00:29:14,969 --> 00:29:17,007
What nonsense is this?

453
00:29:17,007 --> 00:29:18,685
Gwansong!

454
00:29:24,891 --> 00:29:28,964
The offer is much appreciated,
but I have a home to return to.

455
00:29:29,594 --> 00:29:33,749
I'll stay in Yuldoguk for a few days
to write my travelogue, then return to Joseon.

456
00:29:33,749 --> 00:29:35,537
So don't take it personally.

457
00:29:35,537 --> 00:29:38,439
Return to where? Joseon?

458
00:29:38,439 --> 00:29:40,304
That's right.

459
00:29:41,763 --> 00:29:45,259
You won't be able to go back,
so why not just stay here?

460
00:29:45,259 --> 00:29:48,719
If there's a way here,
there must be a way back.

461
00:29:49,748 --> 00:29:51,680
Thank you for everything.

462
00:29:51,680 --> 00:29:55,020
Even after I return,
I won't forget your kindness.

463
00:29:55,808 --> 00:29:58,221
If you ever visit Joseon, come find me.

464
00:29:58,221 --> 00:30:01,347
I will repay this debt properly then.

465
00:30:01,950 --> 00:30:04,791
- Such a fine young man, yet out of his mind.
- Let go of me! What are you doing?

466
00:30:04,791 --> 00:30:05,783
Let me go!

467
00:30:05,783 --> 00:30:08,104
- How painful it must be for his parents…
- Madam!

468
00:30:08,104 --> 00:30:09,683
Madam!

469
00:30:09,683 --> 00:30:11,476
- Madam! Madam!
- Get him in, quickly.

470
00:30:11,476 --> 00:30:14,940
- Madam! Madam!
- Oh! Hurry inside!

471
00:30:18,290 --> 00:30:20,920
Madam! Madam!

472
00:30:22,544 --> 00:30:24,326
Madam!

473
00:30:26,472 --> 00:30:29,652
Where on earth is Eun Sil?
Why isn't she home yet?

474
00:30:29,652 --> 00:30:32,014
She should know better!

475
00:30:32,014 --> 00:30:34,188
Just wait till she gets here!

476
00:30:51,021 --> 00:30:53,251
I'm getting wasted today

477
00:30:53,251 --> 00:30:54,769
so make sure to take care of the aftermath.

478
00:30:54,769 --> 00:30:56,630
Why? What happened?

479
00:30:56,630 --> 00:30:58,646
What happened?

480
00:30:58,646 --> 00:31:00,546
I have a whole series of disasters.

481
00:31:00,546 --> 00:31:02,742
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

482
00:31:02,742 --> 00:31:04,795
Come on, spill it!

483
00:31:05,637 --> 00:31:08,816
Which season do you want me to start from?

484
00:31:13,435 --> 00:31:14,455
What's the matter?

485
00:31:14,455 --> 00:31:16,834
Defying a noble's will…

486
00:31:16,834 --> 00:31:19,092
Come here!

487
00:31:19,092 --> 00:31:21,138
Is there anyone inside?

488
00:31:22,833 --> 00:31:28,277
Sir, can you turn the TV off?
I'm about to have a trauma flashback!

489
00:31:30,672 --> 00:31:32,072
Stop.

490
00:31:32,072 --> 00:31:34,494
Where are you taking me?

491
00:31:34,494 --> 00:31:37,579
Mister, we're just taking you home.

492
00:31:37,579 --> 00:31:40,031
So stop going to that restaurant, okay?

493
00:31:40,031 --> 00:31:41,422
Stop!

494
00:31:41,422 --> 00:31:43,304
I said stop immediately!

495
00:31:43,304 --> 00:31:46,031
Stop! I said...

496
00:31:46,031 --> 00:31:48,003
Don't stop.

497
00:31:56,639 --> 00:31:59,907
This is my first time riding
a Yuldoguk palanquin!

498
00:31:59,907 --> 00:32:03,658
How does it move without horses or people?

499
00:32:03,658 --> 00:32:06,692
What pulls it to make it so fast?

500
00:32:06,692 --> 00:32:09,654
Just tell me where you live.

501
00:32:09,654 --> 00:32:11,970
My home is in Joseon.

502
00:32:12,800 --> 00:32:14,334
If I ride this palanquin

503
00:32:14,334 --> 00:32:17,107
I think I could reach Joseon in a few days.

504
00:32:17,107 --> 00:32:19,123
Do you happen to know the way?

505
00:32:19,123 --> 00:32:22,134
Do you think this is a joke?

506
00:32:25,018 --> 00:32:29,996
Jewelry store robbery
at Seojong 3-ga, K Gold Shop.

507
00:32:29,996 --> 00:32:32,130
Nearby units, proceed for urgent inspection.

508
00:32:32,130 --> 00:32:33,707
Who is it?

509
00:32:33,707 --> 00:32:35,909
Where is this voice coming from?

510
00:32:41,330 --> 00:32:43,318
Mister, just get out of the car!

511
00:32:43,318 --> 00:32:45,311
Hurry and get out!

512
00:32:50,700 --> 00:32:51,969
Hey!

513
00:32:51,969 --> 00:32:53,666
Where am I supposed to go?!

514
00:32:53,666 --> 00:32:55,426
Excuse me!

515
00:33:07,670 --> 00:33:09,958
What place could that be?

516
00:33:30,279 --> 00:33:34,396
The night is no different from the day.
Have the stars descended?

517
00:33:35,779 --> 00:33:40,539
The songs of sleepless souls
mock the moon itself.

518
00:33:47,277 --> 00:33:51,251
A single drink shared between strangers,
and time fades away, what does it matter?

519
00:34:04,684 --> 00:34:07,146
What a beautiful world this is!

520
00:34:13,957 --> 00:34:16,004
He's hilarious.

521
00:34:16,004 --> 00:34:17,269
Hold up!

522
00:34:17,269 --> 00:34:18,623
Oh, man…

523
00:34:18,623 --> 00:34:20,710
Hey, check this guy out!

524
00:34:20,710 --> 00:34:22,381
Bro, can I interview you?

525
00:34:22,381 --> 00:34:25,315
- Interview? What is that?
- A friendly chat.

526
00:34:25,315 --> 00:34:28,776
- Oh, ah… A friendly chat!
- Say hello Hi.

527
00:34:28,776 --> 00:34:30,641
Hi.

528
00:34:30,641 --> 00:34:33,636
Got fired from work…

529
00:34:33,636 --> 00:34:36,364
Kicked out of my house…

530
00:34:37,756 --> 00:34:41,405
It's like getting kicked
when I'm already down.

531
00:34:41,405 --> 00:34:43,242
Don't you agree?

532
00:34:44,194 --> 00:34:46,467
- Hey, check this out!
- What?

533
00:34:46,467 --> 00:34:48,768
- Huh? What is it?
- Right?

534
00:34:49,548 --> 00:34:53,121
Now even you guys
are kicking me while I'm down?

535
00:34:53,121 --> 00:34:54,530
No, it's not that.

536
00:34:54,530 --> 00:34:57,013
Look at this.

537
00:34:57,013 --> 00:35:00,400
Isn't this the homeless guy you were
talking about earlier? It's him, right?

538
00:35:00,400 --> 00:35:01,836
[LIVE Flirting with
Drunk Strangers on the Street!]

539
00:35:01,836 --> 00:35:03,024
Gasp.

540
00:35:03,024 --> 00:35:04,959
Yeah, it's him.

541
00:35:04,959 --> 00:35:07,416
He must be nearby!

542
00:35:10,175 --> 00:35:13,303
Yuldoguk is truly a marvelous place!

543
00:35:13,303 --> 00:35:17,425
Everywhere I turn,
marvels of progress surround me!

544
00:35:17,425 --> 00:35:20,399
The air is filled with the scent of food
and the sound of music, never fading!

545
00:35:20,399 --> 00:35:23,697
So, I can't help but smile.

546
00:35:23,697 --> 00:35:27,637
And the drinks are absolutely exquisite!

547
00:35:28,909 --> 00:35:34,000
Here, people of all ages and backgrounds
mingle freely without class or rank.

548
00:35:35,693 --> 00:35:39,799
If only the people of Joseon
could see this wonder!

549
00:35:39,799 --> 00:35:42,096
But soon, I will return to Joseon!

550
00:35:42,096 --> 00:35:46,875
And when I do, I will spread
the tale of Yuldoguk's wonders!

551
00:35:46,875 --> 00:35:50,228
Hey, Mr. Homeless!

552
00:35:50,228 --> 00:35:53,807
That insolent voice…

553
00:35:53,807 --> 00:35:56,607
Stay right there!

554
00:35:56,607 --> 00:35:58,801
Don't move!

555
00:36:02,478 --> 00:36:05,396
I said don't move!

556
00:36:09,388 --> 00:36:13,788
How did such a rude daughter
come from such a refined mother?

557
00:36:13,788 --> 00:36:15,853
Eun Sil, try this.

558
00:36:15,853 --> 00:36:17,605
Eun Sil.

559
00:36:19,445 --> 00:36:20,858
Eun Sil.

560
00:36:20,858 --> 00:36:24,070
Eun Sil, wake up! Eun Sil.

561
00:36:24,070 --> 00:36:25,614
Oh, my! Breaking news!

562
00:36:25,614 --> 00:36:26,973
Thunder Boys are at a bar across the street!

563
00:36:26,973 --> 00:36:28,484
[Thunder Boys spotted at a bar in Samoh-dong!]
What? For real?

564
00:36:28,484 --> 00:36:32,256
- We have to go! Now!
- How? She's totally wasted.

565
00:36:32,947 --> 00:36:35,310
Eun Sil, Eun Sil.

566
00:36:35,310 --> 00:36:38,194
Eun Sil, wake up Eun Sil!

567
00:36:38,194 --> 00:36:39,963
She's completely out!

568
00:36:39,963 --> 00:36:41,619
Excuse me...

569
00:36:41,619 --> 00:36:44,033
What is "wasted"?

570
00:36:44,033 --> 00:36:45,829
Mister…

571
00:36:45,829 --> 00:36:48,427
What's with that peculiar look?

572
00:36:48,427 --> 00:36:50,546
Can you watch Eun Sil for a moment?

573
00:36:50,546 --> 00:36:53,049
Just for a moment!

574
00:36:53,049 --> 00:36:54,094
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

575
00:36:54,094 --> 00:36:55,865
Excuse me!

576
00:36:57,743 --> 00:37:01,516
Ow! Why'd you hit me?

577
00:37:08,761 --> 00:37:11,319
Ugh, you again?

578
00:37:12,466 --> 00:37:13,553
No!

579
00:37:13,553 --> 00:37:14,748
It's a misunderstanding!

580
00:37:14,748 --> 00:37:16,673
It wasn't me, it was.

581
00:37:46,626 --> 00:37:48,917
Clean up everything before you go!

582
00:37:59,077 --> 00:38:00,857
Mister.

583
00:38:00,857 --> 00:38:05,071
You still smell like cheonggukjang.

584
00:38:05,847 --> 00:38:08,208
That smell is coming from your mouth.

585
00:38:12,235 --> 00:38:16,105
Can you go slowly?
I feel nauseous.

586
00:38:18,764 --> 00:38:20,403
Fine.

587
00:38:21,009 --> 00:38:24,778
By the way, why do you keep
calling me "Mr. Homeless"?

588
00:38:25,407 --> 00:38:29,384
Am I not allowed to call
a homeless guy Mr. Homeless?

589
00:38:29,384 --> 00:38:33,872
I have a name, and I don't like
being called homeless.

590
00:38:33,872 --> 00:38:38,527
You call this place Yuldoguk
without a second thought.

591
00:38:38,527 --> 00:38:41,442
So let's just call things how we like.

592
00:38:42,998 --> 00:38:47,608
Well, I suppose today will be
the last time you call me that.

593
00:38:47,608 --> 00:38:49,870
So, do as you please.

594
00:38:49,870 --> 00:38:52,039
The last time?

595
00:38:52,039 --> 00:38:55,915
I'm returning to Joseon.

596
00:38:55,915 --> 00:39:00,981
So stop arguing with your mother over me
and be a good daughter.

597
00:39:05,087 --> 00:39:06,845
Why are you laughing?

598
00:39:06,845 --> 00:39:10,376
And just how are you planning to get back?

599
00:39:10,376 --> 00:39:13,845
What, do you have a hidden
time machine or something?

600
00:39:13,845 --> 00:39:15,920
What's a machine?

601
00:39:15,920 --> 00:39:18,934
Is that something people in Yuldoguk use?

602
00:39:26,817 --> 00:39:28,423
Wait!

603
00:39:28,423 --> 00:39:30,896
That looks familiar...

604
00:39:30,896 --> 00:39:34,013
Don't tell me you don't know Changdeokgung.

605
00:39:35,652 --> 00:39:38,498
There's a Changdeokgung in Yuldoguk too?

606
00:39:38,498 --> 00:39:41,416
It looks exactly the same
as the one in Joseon.

607
00:39:41,416 --> 00:39:45,762
Of course it does,
because it's the same one.

608
00:39:45,762 --> 00:39:47,602
What do you mean?

609
00:39:47,602 --> 00:39:54,068
That is the actual Changdeokgung from Joseon.

610
00:40:02,774 --> 00:40:07,542
But this isn't Joseon.

611
00:40:07,542 --> 00:40:10,871
Of course not!
Joseon fell a long time ago.

612
00:40:10,871 --> 00:40:12,605
Fell?

613
00:40:12,605 --> 00:40:15,954
You insolent wench!
How dare you speak such nonsense!

614
00:40:15,954 --> 00:40:18,403
What? Wench?

615
00:40:18,403 --> 00:40:20,404
Are you truly out of your mind?

616
00:40:20,404 --> 00:40:25,171
If Joseon fell, then what is this place?

617
00:40:26,344 --> 00:40:29,792
If that's acting, he deserves an Oscar.

618
00:40:29,792 --> 00:40:31,888
Or maybe he's actually crazy.

619
00:40:31,888 --> 00:40:33,725
I'm asking you, what is this place?!

620
00:40:33,725 --> 00:40:36,391
Why are you yelling at me?

621
00:40:39,850 --> 00:40:43,338
Joseon fell over a hundred years ago.

622
00:40:43,338 --> 00:40:45,840
The Yi dynasty is gone.

623
00:40:45,840 --> 00:40:49,179
This is the 21st-century Republic of Korea.

624
00:40:52,328 --> 00:40:55,665
So pull yourself together

625
00:40:55,665 --> 00:40:58,486
and start adjusting to reality.

626
00:41:04,954 --> 00:41:07,160
Here, over here.

627
00:41:13,067 --> 00:41:16,384
So this is the nation that followed Joseon?

628
00:41:18,461 --> 00:41:21,616
I didn't just end up in another country.

629
00:41:21,616 --> 00:41:24,102
I've been sent to the future.

630
00:41:25,590 --> 00:41:28,242
How could such a thing be possible?

631
00:41:30,677 --> 00:41:34,026
Mister, are you going to stay there?

632
00:41:36,874 --> 00:41:41,601
Well, I guess that makes sense.
You're used to sleeping under the open sky.

633
00:41:48,063 --> 00:41:51,248
If you want a ride, come now
before I change my mind.

634
00:42:00,109 --> 00:42:02,243
I'm leaving for real.

635
00:42:08,011 --> 00:42:10,171
Let's go.

636
00:42:31,010 --> 00:42:33,474
You look like the world just ended.

637
00:42:34,104 --> 00:42:37,072
If I hadn't thrown up,
I would've just ignored you completely.

638
00:42:44,932 --> 00:42:46,642
Here.

639
00:42:50,178 --> 00:42:52,563
Consider your debt paid.

640
00:43:08,389 --> 00:43:11,562
He won't just sit there all night… will he?

641
00:43:11,562 --> 00:43:13,691
Not in this rain…

642
00:43:16,151 --> 00:43:17,722
What do I care?

643
00:43:17,722 --> 00:43:21,096
Mr. Homeless, get out of my head!

644
00:43:34,601 --> 00:43:36,951
Jeez!

645
00:43:36,951 --> 00:43:39,954
Why are you just sitting there?

646
00:43:39,954 --> 00:43:43,640
How could a mother sleep
when her daughter isn't home?

647
00:43:44,950 --> 00:43:47,267
Didn't you kick me out?

648
00:43:47,267 --> 00:43:50,302
Don't pretend you care.

649
00:43:50,302 --> 00:43:53,431
Other people always come first with you.

650
00:43:53,431 --> 00:43:54,840
You reek of alcohol.

651
00:43:54,840 --> 00:43:57,534
If you're drunk, just go to bed.

652
00:43:57,534 --> 00:43:59,476
Tell me I'm wrong.

653
00:43:59,476 --> 00:44:02,574
Have I ever been your priority?

654
00:44:03,343 --> 00:44:05,873
You never once took me on a trip

655
00:44:05,873 --> 00:44:09,309
not even a school event.

656
00:44:16,086 --> 00:44:19,450
The kids always teased me
about smelling like food.

657
00:44:19,450 --> 00:44:21,761
So I wore my gym clothes
instead of my uniform at school.

658
00:44:21,761 --> 00:44:23,964
You never even noticed, did you?

659
00:44:25,320 --> 00:44:28,277
Why bring up old stories now?

660
00:44:29,230 --> 00:44:31,024
Just like yesterday.

661
00:44:31,660 --> 00:44:33,880
You never even asked what happened at work.

662
00:44:33,880 --> 00:44:36,471
You just blamed me like always.

663
00:44:38,787 --> 00:44:40,259
Did something happen?

664
00:44:40,259 --> 00:44:41,898
Forget it.

665
00:44:41,898 --> 00:44:44,327
It's not like you really care.

666
00:44:45,189 --> 00:44:47,502
You told me to leave and live my own life.

667
00:44:48,961 --> 00:44:51,124
Starting tomorrow,
I'm looking for my own place

668
00:44:51,124 --> 00:44:53,262
I'm not living with you anymore.

669
00:45:09,896 --> 00:45:12,120
No matter how far into
the future this may be...

670
00:45:12,120 --> 00:45:15,084
If there was a way here,
there must be a way back.

671
00:45:22,957 --> 00:45:25,398
I must retrace my steps.

672
00:45:26,473 --> 00:45:28,851
From the moment
I first arrived in this place...

673
00:45:30,613 --> 00:45:33,923
How could a Transcendent Genius like me
fail to find a way?

674
00:45:35,962 --> 00:45:37,703
Ah, it's freezing…

675
00:45:37,703 --> 00:45:40,264
Ugh! Absolutely freezing!

676
00:45:41,854 --> 00:45:45,404
I woke up somewhere around here...

677
00:45:46,457 --> 00:45:49,204
but the rain has washed away any trace.

678
00:45:52,050 --> 00:45:54,446
Perhaps the madam would know.

679
00:45:59,464 --> 00:46:01,102
Madam!

680
00:46:10,478 --> 00:46:12,204
Excuse me...

681
00:46:14,536 --> 00:46:16,558
I was just a moment too late.

682
00:46:18,163 --> 00:46:20,479
She couldn't have gone far.

683
00:46:27,894 --> 00:46:31,490
Why is it pouring so hard?

684
00:46:57,914 --> 00:47:00,079
It's time for you to go.

685
00:47:12,316 --> 00:47:15,233
What a vivid dream.

686
00:47:33,587 --> 00:47:36,435
Am I still half-asleep, hearing things?

687
00:47:37,838 --> 00:47:40,243
I thought I heard something…

688
00:47:59,654 --> 00:48:01,399
Madam!

689
00:48:03,653 --> 00:48:06,187
Madam! Wake up!

690
00:48:06,187 --> 00:48:07,960
Madam!

691
00:48:11,307 --> 00:48:13,078
Help!

692
00:48:13,078 --> 00:48:15,164
Is no one around?!

693
00:48:15,925 --> 00:48:18,164
She's dying!

694
00:48:18,164 --> 00:48:20,514
Please, someone help!
