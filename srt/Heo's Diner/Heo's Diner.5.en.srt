you must carefully peel every last skin.

183
00:12:32,031 --> 00:12:35,903
Ugh, I was up all night
fighting haters online.

184
00:12:36,540 --> 00:12:40,057
I had to defend our chef.

185
00:12:42,028 --> 00:12:45,264
A grown woman spending the night brawling.

186
00:12:45,264 --> 00:12:47,702
If your mother knew,
she'd have given you a scolding.

187
00:12:48,903 --> 00:12:52,077
Why are we even making tofu from scratch?

188
00:12:52,077 --> 00:12:54,171
They sell it at the market!

189
00:12:54,171 --> 00:12:57,346
You really have no sense of efficiency.

190
00:12:57,346 --> 00:12:59,524
Back in Joseon,
the people outside Changuimun

191
00:12:59,524 --> 00:13:02,599
were known for their smooth and delicate tofu.

192
00:13:02,599 --> 00:13:05,267
But such tofu is hard to find here

193
00:13:05,267 --> 00:13:07,980
so we must make it ourselves.

194
00:13:07,980 --> 00:13:10,147
Changuimun tofu?

195
00:13:10,147 --> 00:13:11,742
That's a thing?

196
00:13:11,742 --> 00:13:13,679
I've never heard of it.

197
00:13:14,526 --> 00:13:16,799
Did you not read
the "Domundaejak" I gave you?

198
00:13:16,799 --> 00:13:19,212
It's written in there.

199
00:13:19,212 --> 00:13:21,425
"Domundaejak?"

200
00:13:21,425 --> 00:13:23,513
Oh, the collateral?

201
00:13:23,513 --> 00:13:26,582
How was I supposed to read it?
It's all in classical Chinese!

202
00:13:28,681 --> 00:13:31,333
But you didn't even write that, did you?

203
00:13:31,333 --> 00:13:32,659
You copied it from somewhere, right?

204
00:13:32,659 --> 00:13:35,855
How dare you question the integrity
of a Transcendent Genius!

205
00:13:37,533 --> 00:13:41,065
Regardless, good food begins with sincerity.

206
00:13:41,902 --> 00:13:45,391
When I think about the customers coming
all this way for our cooking

207
00:13:45,391 --> 00:13:47,763
how could I serve them
anything less than my best?

208
00:13:47,763 --> 00:13:51,396
Yeah, yeah. You sound even more
dramatic than my mom.

209
00:13:53,279 --> 00:13:54,897
Mr. Homeless.

210
00:13:54,897 --> 00:13:57,934
Then how about we raise the price

211
00:13:57,934 --> 00:13:59,826
just a little?

212
00:14:00,518 --> 00:14:03,896
I mean, our prices are ridiculously low.

213
00:14:03,896 --> 00:14:06,998
Where else can you get a meal
for 5,000 won these days?

214
00:14:06,998 --> 00:14:08,238
Impossible.

215
00:14:08,238 --> 00:14:09,415
Why not?

216
00:14:09,415 --> 00:14:11,510
Your mother wouldn't approve.

217
00:14:11,510 --> 00:14:14,670
Which is exactly why we should raise it
before she gets back.

218
00:14:15,586 --> 00:14:19,039
I chose to cook here
because I respect her wish

219
00:14:19,039 --> 00:14:23,487
to serve affordable meals
to the hungry.

220
00:14:25,069 --> 00:14:26,826
- Just 2,000 won more.
- Impossible.

221
00:14:26,826 --> 00:14:29,261
Oh, just 1,000 won.

222
00:14:29,261 --> 00:14:30,970
Absolutely not.

223
00:14:30,970 --> 00:14:33,155
Ugh, I quit! I'm not peeling the beans!

224
00:14:33,155 --> 00:14:36,093
You expect me to do this kind of labor
for just 5,000 won?

225
00:14:36,093 --> 00:14:37,826
It all tastes the same anyway.

226
00:14:37,826 --> 00:14:39,844
Let's just take it easy!

227
00:15:02,184 --> 00:15:03,593
Taste it.

228
00:15:03,593 --> 00:15:05,267
No thanks.

229
00:15:07,282 --> 00:15:08,542
Just one bite

230
00:15:08,542 --> 00:15:09,937
I said I'm good.

231
00:15:09,937 --> 00:15:11,814
- Just one bite!
- Oh, I said...

232
00:15:15,001 --> 00:15:17,046
Is it that good?

233
00:15:17,733 --> 00:15:20,418
It's hot!

234
00:15:20,418 --> 00:15:22,326
Oh...

235
00:15:22,326 --> 00:15:25,789
Ah, I forgot it was still boiling.

236
00:15:25,789 --> 00:15:28,022
But then...

237
00:15:28,022 --> 00:15:30,001
It's like hot ice cream?

238
00:15:34,775 --> 00:15:38,472
It just melts instantly,
leaving only the nutty flavor behind.

239
00:15:38,472 --> 00:15:42,164
That's because you peeled
the beans so thoroughly.

240
00:15:47,884 --> 00:15:50,657
Fine, I'll keep peeling…

241
00:15:50,657 --> 00:15:52,810
But we are revisiting the price talk later.

242
00:15:54,240 --> 00:15:55,818
Agreed.

243
00:15:55,818 --> 00:15:57,621
Keep peeling.

244
00:16:04,012 --> 00:16:06,110
[Dorae]

245
00:16:06,110 --> 00:16:09,009
[Closed for today]

246
00:16:18,686 --> 00:16:21,607
Mr. Lee will be with you shortly.

247
00:16:21,607 --> 00:16:24,438
So he calls us here,
only to keep us waiting?

248
00:16:24,438 --> 00:16:26,406
What kind of nonsense is this?

249
00:16:26,406 --> 00:16:27,951
I'm sorry.

250
00:16:27,951 --> 00:16:30,144
Tell him to hurry up.

251
00:16:36,834 --> 00:16:40,224
But why insist on meeting in person?

252
00:16:40,224 --> 00:16:42,229
What does he want?

253
00:16:42,934 --> 00:16:47,047
You're giving me a headache
Just sit down.

254
00:16:47,047 --> 00:16:49,943
You always overthink things.

255
00:16:49,943 --> 00:16:51,627
Isn't it obvious?

256
00:16:51,627 --> 00:16:53,540
What is?

257
00:16:53,540 --> 00:16:56,730
Even if we're done for good...

258
00:16:56,730 --> 00:16:59,401
He still wants to see me one last time.

259
00:17:00,443 --> 00:17:05,105
You really do live
in your own fantasy world.

260
00:17:08,108 --> 00:17:10,192
- Welcome.
- Table for two.

261
00:17:11,135 --> 00:17:15,052
Here's your two soft tofu stews.

262
00:17:15,052 --> 00:17:17,116
Enjoy your meal.

263
00:17:19,188 --> 00:17:20,993
Detective Kang!

264
00:17:23,119 --> 00:17:25,151
So, you've reopened.

265
00:17:25,151 --> 00:17:27,095
Yes, would you like to eat?

266
00:17:27,095 --> 00:17:28,678
Sure, why not?

267
00:17:28,678 --> 00:17:30,820
You!

268
00:17:30,820 --> 00:17:34,177
You're the officer who locked me up
without so much as an apology!

269
00:17:35,045 --> 00:17:36,791
How dare you show your face here?!

270
00:17:39,341 --> 00:17:42,406
Don't tell me, he's...

271
00:17:42,406 --> 00:17:47,188
Yes, he's in charge of our kitchen.

272
00:17:47,188 --> 00:17:49,811
I refuse to serve him my food.

273
00:17:49,811 --> 00:17:51,186
Oh, come on…

274
00:17:51,186 --> 00:17:52,756
Yeah, well...

275
00:17:52,756 --> 00:17:55,115
I guess that means no food for me today.

276
00:17:55,115 --> 00:17:58,118
Nonsense, have a seat.

277
00:17:58,118 --> 00:17:59,786
No!

278
00:17:59,786 --> 00:18:01,281
Go.

279
00:18:03,819 --> 00:18:04,940
[Heo Gyun]

280
00:18:04,940 --> 00:18:06,245
[Eun Sil]

281
00:18:24,296 --> 00:18:25,793
Would you like a bowl of soft tofu?

282
00:18:25,793 --> 00:18:27,907
Yes, yes.

283
00:18:27,907 --> 00:18:29,545
One soft tofu stew.

284
00:18:31,062 --> 00:18:32,660
He's not coming.

285
00:18:33,667 --> 00:18:35,107
Let's just go.

286
00:18:35,107 --> 00:18:37,307
Huh? Just like that?

287
00:18:37,307 --> 00:18:40,345
How long are we supposed to wait?

288
00:18:40,345 --> 00:18:42,151
Ugh, seriously.

289
00:18:46,711 --> 00:18:49,284
Apologies for keeping you waiting.

290
00:18:49,284 --> 00:18:51,171
Chef Lee.

291
00:18:51,171 --> 00:18:53,340
You railed at me when I was late

292
00:18:53,340 --> 00:18:55,259
but now look at you.

293
00:19:00,127 --> 00:19:01,665
Please, have a seat, Mi Sol.

294
00:19:01,665 --> 00:19:03,731
This won't take long.

295
00:19:09,644 --> 00:19:12,675
Okay, let me explain the incident

296
00:19:12,675 --> 00:19:18,497
behind the much-talked-about
promotional video for Restaurant Dorae.

297
00:19:22,364 --> 00:19:24,040
This is good.

298
00:19:24,040 --> 00:19:25,754
How strange.

299
00:19:29,167 --> 00:19:30,770
So?

300
00:19:30,770 --> 00:19:33,594
Did you find the person she met
right before the accident?

301
00:19:35,611 --> 00:19:38,636
Oh, that?

302
00:19:38,636 --> 00:19:41,471
You seem to be mistaken.

303
00:19:41,471 --> 00:19:44,367
There was no one next to her that day.

304
00:19:44,367 --> 00:19:45,642
Unbelievable!

305
00:19:45,642 --> 00:19:49,808
I thought you were just a nasty officer,
but you're an incompetent one too!

306
00:19:49,808 --> 00:19:52,053
I saw someone with my own eyes!

307
00:19:52,053 --> 00:19:56,143
There's footage of her walking alone.

308
00:19:56,143 --> 00:19:59,500
So let's not go over this again, okay?

309
00:19:59,500 --> 00:20:01,136
Footage?

310
00:20:03,455 --> 00:20:07,921
Are you talking about the marvel
that captures the past?

311
00:20:07,921 --> 00:20:09,240
Let me see it, too.

312
00:20:09,240 --> 00:20:11,622
Oh, please.

313
00:20:11,622 --> 00:20:15,373
Not just anyone gets to see that.

314
00:20:15,373 --> 00:20:18,077
I said there was no one, so drop it.

315
00:20:19,263 --> 00:20:21,943
That can't be right…

316
00:20:23,104 --> 00:20:25,112
Wait.

317
00:20:25,112 --> 00:20:27,123
Are you absolutely sure?

318
00:20:27,123 --> 00:20:29,093
Yes, I am.

319
00:20:29,093 --> 00:20:32,679
Mister, stop pestering the detective.

320
00:20:33,967 --> 00:20:36,379
Could I have imagined it?

321
00:20:37,295 --> 00:20:38,559
Thank you.

322
00:20:38,559 --> 00:20:40,546
That was a good meal.

323
00:20:42,169 --> 00:20:44,217
Thank you, detective. Come again!

324
00:20:44,217 --> 00:20:47,241
She said, "Come again,"
but do not come again!

325
00:20:54,463 --> 00:20:56,917
I thought they were closed today.

326
00:20:56,917 --> 00:20:59,260
Then what's with all those cars?

327
00:21:03,323 --> 00:21:05,891
The reason I've gathered you all here today

328
00:21:05,891 --> 00:21:09,115
is at the request of Jung Mi Sol.

329
00:21:09,115 --> 00:21:13,247
The statement you see now
was sent by her company's CEO.

330
00:21:14,734 --> 00:21:18,059
Since Mi Sol found it difficult
to speak on her own

331
00:21:18,059 --> 00:21:20,077
they asked me to do so in her place.

332
00:21:20,077 --> 00:21:21,303
Our CEO?

333
00:21:21,303 --> 00:21:23,458
I had no idea...

334
00:21:27,795 --> 00:21:29,454
Ow! That's hot!

335
00:21:32,064 --> 00:21:33,799
Are you all right?

336
00:21:35,012 --> 00:21:38,294
We should get this treated first.

337
00:21:38,294 --> 00:21:39,855
We're closing for today.

338
00:21:39,855 --> 00:21:42,185
Everyone, please leave!

339
00:21:42,185 --> 00:21:43,696
What are you talking about?

340
00:21:43,696 --> 00:21:46,311
It's all money sitting there!

341
00:21:46,311 --> 00:21:49,156
We're still open, please don't go.

342
00:21:49,842 --> 00:21:52,453
How do you plan to work with that hand?

343
00:21:53,398 --> 00:21:55,075
I'm fine.

344
00:21:55,075 --> 00:21:57,588
Stop overreacting and go make soft tofu.

345
00:21:57,588 --> 00:21:59,604
One more soft tofu, please.

346
00:21:59,604 --> 00:22:01,437
- Got it! One more soft tofu!
- Yes.

347
00:22:01,437 --> 00:22:03,048
Mister, hurry up.

348
00:22:04,920 --> 00:22:06,885
How...

349
00:22:08,600 --> 00:22:10,616
From a young age, Jung Mi Sol

350
00:22:10,616 --> 00:22:15,084
captured the nation's heart
as the Commercial Film Fairy.

351
00:22:17,973 --> 00:22:20,592
Why am I the only one
having a hard time? Why!

352
00:22:20,592 --> 00:22:22,943
Why!

353
00:22:22,943 --> 00:22:25,281
But after transitioning to acting,
her career hit a slump

354
00:22:25,281 --> 00:22:28,199
due to criticism of her poor performances.

355
00:22:28,199 --> 00:22:31,558
Desperate to reclaim her popularity,
Mi Sol didn't focus on improving her acting.

356
00:22:31,558 --> 00:22:35,897
Instead, she became obsessed
with her appearance.

357
00:22:35,897 --> 00:22:39,844
And that led her to develop
an eating disorder.

358
00:22:39,844 --> 00:22:43,863
In other words,
she forces herself to vomit after eating.

359
00:22:43,863 --> 00:22:47,793
These days, they call it
"binge-purge syndrome".

360
00:22:48,454 --> 00:22:55,527
She came to the hospital,
fully covered in a hat and mask.

361
00:22:55,527 --> 00:22:57,935
But I recognized Jung Mi Sol's voice.

362
00:22:57,935 --> 00:23:02,199
She kept saying she'd throw up
everything she ate…

363
00:23:07,415 --> 00:23:10,288
- Seriously?
- No way.

364
00:23:11,120 --> 00:23:13,354
Ah, yes.

365
00:23:13,354 --> 00:23:15,752
I know this may be hard to believe.

366
00:23:15,752 --> 00:23:20,741
After all, Mi Sol has always claimed
to maintain her figure solely through exercise.

367
00:23:20,741 --> 00:23:24,730
I just squeeze in workouts
whenever I can at home.

368
00:23:24,730 --> 00:23:28,778
That way, I never let calories
settle in my body.

369
00:23:30,284 --> 00:23:34,402
You can lose weight healthily,
just like me!

370
00:23:38,149 --> 00:23:41,108
But it was all a lie.

371
00:23:41,108 --> 00:23:45,033
I looked into it, and turns out
that entire clip was a paid product placement.

372
00:23:45,033 --> 00:23:47,625
PPL? Without me knowing?

373
00:23:47,625 --> 00:23:50,054
That's not the issue right now.

374
00:23:51,242 --> 00:23:53,541
And now, this case is no different.

375
00:23:53,541 --> 00:23:55,468
Without disclosing her health issues,

376
00:23:55,468 --> 00:23:58,142
Mi Sol took part in the promotional video

377
00:23:58,142 --> 00:24:02,298
tarnishing Dorae's image

378
00:24:03,014 --> 00:24:06,001
and causing immense financial damage.

379
00:24:06,001 --> 00:24:13,202
But neither I nor Dorae intend to
take legal action over the losses.

380
00:24:13,202 --> 00:24:15,251
What we truly hope,

381
00:24:15,251 --> 00:24:19,808
is for Jung Mi Sol to break free
from her distorted obsession with beauty

382
00:24:20,597 --> 00:24:27,827
and truly overcome her eating disorder.

383
00:24:29,249 --> 00:24:32,449
Jung Mi Sol, is this all true?

384
00:24:32,449 --> 00:24:34,139
Do you have anything to say in response?

385
00:24:34,139 --> 00:24:35,697
How are you feeling right now?

386
00:24:35,697 --> 00:24:38,434
Is it true that you force yourself to throw up?

387
00:24:39,360 --> 00:24:44,456
What the hell do you know about me
to talk like that?

388
00:24:46,653 --> 00:24:47,694
Mi Sol!

389
00:24:47,694 --> 00:24:49,004
- Jung Mi Sol!
- Jung Mi Sol!

390
00:24:49,004 --> 00:24:50,259
Please say something!

391
00:24:50,259 --> 00:24:51,437
Is this all true?

392
00:24:51,437 --> 00:24:53,612
Give a comment, Jung Mi Sol!

393
00:24:59,268 --> 00:25:02,006
So, this was your plan.

394
00:25:02,006 --> 00:25:04,163
I had faith in you, Mr. Lee.

395
00:25:04,163 --> 00:25:05,631
What did I tell you?

396
00:25:05,631 --> 00:25:08,114
Didn't I say he would handle it just fine?

397
00:25:08,114 --> 00:25:12,253
I know there's no one like Mr. Lee.

398
00:25:12,253 --> 00:25:14,424
After that mess with the diner,

399
00:25:14,424 --> 00:25:16,763
I was worried he'd just talk
his way through again.

400
00:25:16,763 --> 00:25:18,707
It was out of concern.

401
00:25:19,454 --> 00:25:23,821
On my way here,
I saw that the diner reopened.

402
00:25:23,821 --> 00:25:25,890
Are you sure there's nothing to worry about?

403
00:25:27,119 --> 00:25:30,861
If you mean the one across the street,
there's nothing to worry about.

404
00:25:30,861 --> 00:25:35,533
A man with zero cooking experience
is running the kitchen.

405
00:25:35,533 --> 00:25:39,054
But as you know, running a restaurant
is not some children's play.

406
00:25:39,054 --> 00:25:40,823
There's no way that'll work.

407
00:25:41,827 --> 00:25:44,744
They'll crash and burn soon enough.

408
00:25:44,744 --> 00:25:48,550
Well, if you say so,
I guess there's nothing to worry about.

409
00:25:49,270 --> 00:25:52,061
We're counting on you, Mr. Lee.

410
00:25:52,061 --> 00:25:53,652
Good work.

411
00:25:56,053 --> 00:25:58,057
- Nice job.
- Well done.

412
00:26:04,091 --> 00:26:09,489
Wow, I was wondering
how you'd get out of the Jung Mi Sol mess.

413
00:26:09,489 --> 00:26:11,501
That was impressive.

414
00:26:11,501 --> 00:26:14,405
- Glad you think so.
- Then...

415
00:26:14,405 --> 00:26:19,513
But you seem a little too confident
about that diner.

416
00:26:19,513 --> 00:26:21,967
"They'll crash and burn on their own?"

417
00:26:23,000 --> 00:26:26,605
That sounds a bit too optimistic,
don't you think?

418
00:26:26,605 --> 00:26:30,085
That's my professional assessment
as a restaurant owner.

419
00:26:30,085 --> 00:26:33,521
Someone like him can't revive a diner.

420
00:26:33,521 --> 00:26:36,208
Have you tried their food?

421
00:26:36,208 --> 00:26:37,882
You haven't, have you?

422
00:26:39,151 --> 00:26:42,026
He probably just copied something he saw.

423
00:26:42,026 --> 00:26:45,699
I wouldn't call that real cooking.

424
00:26:46,451 --> 00:26:48,782
It was phenomenal.

425
00:26:48,782 --> 00:26:50,659
How should I put it?

426
00:26:50,659 --> 00:26:54,885
It's familiar yet oddly new.

427
00:26:56,447 --> 00:27:02,239
So why not put your pride aside and use me?

428
00:27:02,239 --> 00:27:04,223
I'm offering to take care
of the dirty work for you

429
00:27:04,223 --> 00:27:06,245
but you keep pushing me away.

430
00:27:06,245 --> 00:27:08,042
Kind of hurts my feelings.

431
00:27:11,817 --> 00:27:15,463
It's because you keep
crossing the line, Detective Kang.

432
00:27:15,463 --> 00:27:18,330
So I have no choice but to draw it again.

433
00:27:23,223 --> 00:27:26,894
From now on, stay out of my restaurant.

434
00:27:26,894 --> 00:27:30,025
Unless I call for you first.

435
00:27:31,248 --> 00:27:32,846
Then...

436
00:27:43,321 --> 00:27:44,972
Mi Sol!

437
00:27:47,291 --> 00:27:49,591
Where did Jung Mi Sol go?

438
00:27:49,591 --> 00:27:51,693
Where is she?

439
00:27:51,693 --> 00:27:53,097
Let's go that way.

440
00:27:53,097 --> 00:27:54,689
To the right?

441
00:27:54,689 --> 00:27:56,067
Hurry.

442
00:27:56,067 --> 00:27:57,845
Are they gone?

443
00:28:00,568 --> 00:28:02,067
They're gone.

444
00:28:06,545 --> 00:28:08,432
Stay put for a bit longer.

445
00:28:08,432 --> 00:28:11,361
- Is that Jung Mi Sol?
- Looks like her.

446
00:28:12,088 --> 00:28:13,713
Yeah, I think it's her.

447

00:28:27,492 --> 00:28:30,245
Where did he go? We're swamped here!

449
00:28:31,665 --> 00:28:34,552
Mr. Homeless!

450
00:28:34,552 --> 00:28:37,178
Mr. Homeless!

451
00:28:37,178 --> 00:28:39,110
Stay here for a moment

452
00:28:39,110 --> 00:28:41,039
I'll tell you when the coast is clear.

453
00:28:41,873 --> 00:28:43,404
Excuse me.

454
00:28:44,609 --> 00:28:47,464
I appreciate the help since last time

455
00:28:48,162 --> 00:28:50,815
but I don't take in stalkers.

456
00:28:50,815 --> 00:28:51,831
Take in what?

457
00:28:51,831 --> 00:28:53,605
Mr. Homeless!

458
00:28:54,428 --> 00:28:56,353
Let's talk again later.

459
00:29:41,092 --> 00:29:42,850
This is the last bowl of soft tofu.

460
00:29:43,794 --> 00:29:45,888
Enjoy.

461
00:29:45,888 --> 00:29:47,792
Goodbye.

462
00:29:50,400 --> 00:29:53,700
That's it for today!

463
00:29:59,650 --> 00:30:02,896
See? You are not okay at all!

464
00:30:03,563 --> 00:30:05,691
My goodness.

465
00:30:07,059 --> 00:30:08,756
Come over here.

466
00:30:13,834 --> 00:30:18,334
How many bowls did you serve
with your hand like this?

467
00:30:18,334 --> 00:30:20,110
125 bowls!

468
00:30:20,731 --> 00:30:23,399
We sold 125 servings today!

469
00:30:23,399 --> 00:30:26,112
Sales are even higher than yesterday.

470
00:30:28,334 --> 00:30:30,126
But your injury is serious.

471
00:30:30,126 --> 00:30:34,466
I think we should close tomorrow
so you can rest.

472
00:30:34,466 --> 00:30:36,112
What are you talking about?

473
00:30:36,112 --> 00:30:38,523
If we keep closing for every little thing

474
00:30:38,523 --> 00:30:40,523
when are we ever going to make money?

475
00:30:41,327 --> 00:30:43,629
Health comes before money.

476
00:30:43,629 --> 00:30:45,322
No, money!

477
00:30:45,322 --> 00:30:47,763
Money always comes first!

478
00:30:47,763 --> 00:30:51,750
We should push even harder
while we're on an upswing!

479
00:30:51,750 --> 00:30:55,710
Oh, first, let's name this diner.

480
00:30:56,898 --> 00:31:00,306
We've done just fine without one.

481
00:31:00,306 --> 00:31:02,660
Why do we need one now?

482
00:31:03,575 --> 00:31:06,478
Because we need it for social media,

483
00:31:06,478 --> 00:31:08,011
delivery apps,

484
00:31:08,011 --> 00:31:10,286
and GPS.

485
00:31:10,286 --> 00:31:12,153
GP?

486
00:31:12,153 --> 00:31:13,840
Is it a pot?

487
00:31:13,840 --> 00:31:16,633
I have no idea what you're saying.

488
00:31:16,633 --> 00:31:18,301
Well...

489
00:31:18,301 --> 00:31:20,317
It's hard to explain, but trust me.

490
00:31:20,317 --> 00:31:22,789
Having a name is incredibly important.

491
00:31:22,789 --> 00:31:27,415
Maybe I should go to a naming center
and get one that brings in money?

I could've sworn I told you before.

497
00:31:49,977 --> 00:31:52,036
I better go see Mom.

498
00:31:52,993 --> 00:31:54,357
I'll be back.

499
00:31:58,155 --> 00:32:00,292
She says names are important

500
00:32:00,292 --> 00:32:03,165
yet she doesn't even know the name
of the person she's with.

501
00:32:03,165 --> 00:32:05,372

Since you insist...

541
00:36:10,499 --> 00:36:13,564
I took care of the sign while I was out.

542
00:36:13,564 --> 00:36:15,710
I picked a name for the restaurant.

543
00:36:16,575 --> 00:36:18,261
What did you name it?

544
00:36:19,676 --> 00:36:22,510
You'll see for yourself later.

545
00:36:29,331 --> 00:36:31,130
They taste good, right?

546
00:36:33,860 --> 00:36:37,045
But then, where is the fish?

547
00:36:37,045 --> 00:36:39,049
I do not see it at all.

548
00:36:39,049 --> 00:36:42,178
Bungeoppang doesn't actually have fish in it.

549
00:36:45,960 --> 00:36:47,767
Then isn't that fraud?

550
00:36:47,767 --> 00:36:51,288
That's like selling beef gukbap
with no beef in it!

551
00:37:00,488 --> 00:37:02,994
It's me, Detective Kang.

552
00:37:04,806 --> 00:37:08,261
I'll leave it in your hands.

553
00:37:29,850 --> 00:37:33,066
[Beef Gukbap]

554
00:37:34,683 --> 00:37:38,142
"Side dish refills are self-serve!"

555
00:37:38,142 --> 00:37:39,945
"Self-serve?"

556
00:37:40,878 --> 00:37:44,344
Since my hand is injured,
I might be slow serving food.

557
00:37:44,344 --> 00:37:47,309
So I figured customers could
help themselves to side dishes.

558
00:37:48,168 --> 00:37:51,507
"Self-serve" must mean helping oneself.

559
00:37:51,507 --> 00:37:52,908
That's right.

560
00:37:52,908 --> 00:37:54,749
That's a great phrase.

561
00:37:54,749 --> 00:37:58,561
Of all the words I've learned here,
this is my favorite.

562
00:37:59,853 --> 00:38:03,585
Now, shall we open the diner?

563
00:38:09,509 --> 00:38:12,109
Get in line!

564
00:38:12,109 --> 00:38:14,084
Side dish refills are self-serve!

565
00:38:14,084 --> 00:38:16,568
More kkakdugi, please!

566
00:38:16,568 --> 00:38:18,698
Side dish refills are self-serve!

567
00:38:18,698 --> 00:38:21,433
Can we get three bowls of gukbap over here?

568
00:38:21,433 --> 00:38:23,554
Got it, just a moment.

569
00:38:23,554 --> 00:38:25,690
The kkakdugi is perfectly fermented.

570
00:38:25,690 --> 00:38:27,355
Thank you for the meal.

571
00:38:29,168 --> 00:38:31,655
Wow, beef gukbap!

572
00:38:32,263 --> 00:38:34,051
- Some water here, please.
- Welcome.

573
00:38:34,051 --> 00:38:35,323
Mister, water.

574
00:38:35,323 --> 00:38:36,792
Okay.

575
00:39:14,878 --> 00:39:16,133
Wait!

576
00:39:16,133 --> 00:39:20,317
There's a cockroach in my soup,
and that's your reaction?!

577
00:39:20,317 --> 00:39:23,173
There's nothing wrong with my food.

578
00:39:23,173 --> 00:39:26,337
Only the right ingredients ever go in.

579
00:39:26,337 --> 00:39:28,944
Are you saying I'm lying?

580
00:39:28,944 --> 00:39:31,689
Yes. Why cause trouble with a false accusation?

581
00:39:31,689 --> 00:39:33,384
Get out of here!

582
00:39:34,770 --> 00:39:37,799
Oh, look at this!

583
00:39:37,799 --> 00:39:41,248
Maybe a health inspection report
will knock some sense into you.

584
00:39:41,248 --> 00:39:43,044
Mister, stay inside.

585
00:39:44,451 --> 00:39:46,726
You want me to just stand by
while this happens?

586
00:39:47,315 --> 00:39:49,214
Just go inside.

587
00:39:49,947 --> 00:39:53,945
I sincerely apologize, sir.

588
00:39:53,945 --> 00:39:55,705
Why are you apologizing?

589
00:39:56,409 --> 00:39:58,932
Do you also believe that thug's lie?

590
00:39:58,932 --> 00:40:00,564
Hey, hey!

591
00:40:00,564 --> 00:40:01,894
What's going on?

592
00:40:01,894 --> 00:40:03,428
Young lady!

593
00:40:07,142 --> 00:40:08,975
How dare you!

594
00:40:21,165 --> 00:40:24,650
Chef, we'll serve the dessert
for the main table.

595
00:40:24,650 --> 00:40:27,406
No, I'll do it.

596
00:40:39,856 --> 00:40:42,773
Is this the final course?

597
00:40:42,773 --> 00:40:46,662
I've never had
such a luxurious meal in my life.

598
00:40:46,662 --> 00:40:50,101
You can't afford something like this
with the salary of a civil servant.

599
00:40:58,619 --> 00:41:00,003
Nice.

600
00:41:01,213 --> 00:41:03,152
Wow.

601
00:41:03,152 --> 00:41:06,402
Did you get the job done?

602
00:41:15,892 --> 00:41:17,354
I told you.

603
00:41:17,354 --> 00:41:20,013
By the time I finish this meal,
it'll be done.

604
00:41:21,498 --> 00:41:25,484
The method may be outdated,
but what matters is that it works.

605
00:41:25,484 --> 00:41:27,708
Classic never goes out of style, you know?

606
00:41:30,305 --> 00:41:32,661
They won't be able to reopen
the diner for a while.

607
00:41:36,024 --> 00:41:38,088
Well done.

608
00:41:38,088 --> 00:41:42,919
But why the change of heart?

609
00:41:42,919 --> 00:41:46,017
I didn't think you'd reach out to me.

610
00:41:46,816 --> 00:41:48,560
Because he irritates me.

611
00:41:49,377 --> 00:41:51,149
Gwansong!

612
00:41:58,052 --> 00:42:00,288
Everything about him.

613
00:42:13,413 --> 00:42:14,664
Stop.

614
00:42:14,664 --> 00:42:16,290
With that hand…

615
00:42:16,954 --> 00:42:18,823
You'll make it worse.

616
00:42:18,823 --> 00:42:21,521
We need to clean up quickly
and get back to business.

617
00:42:22,840 --> 00:42:26,516
You still want to run the diner
in this situation?

618
00:42:28,085 --> 00:42:32,353
If we throw out the gukbap
and make a fresh batch,

619
00:42:32,353 --> 00:42:34,712
we can still hit our sales target.

620
00:42:34,712 --> 00:42:37,138
There's nothing wrong with my gukbap.

621
00:42:37,734 --> 00:42:40,372
So, stop worrying about that

622
00:42:40,372 --> 00:42:42,447
and focus on getting treatment first.

623
00:42:43,869 --> 00:42:45,653
I'll go get groceries.

624
00:42:49,294 --> 00:42:51,268
Why are you doing this?

625
00:42:53,396 --> 00:42:55,145
We need to run the business.

626
00:42:55,145 --> 00:42:56,958
Don't you want to make money?

627
00:42:57,549 --> 00:43:00,262
You and your money, money, money!

628
00:43:00,262 --> 00:43:04,098
Is that all you ever think about?

629
00:43:04,098 --> 00:43:06,882
Yes, that's right.

630
00:43:07,729 --> 00:43:09,829
I only care about money.

631
00:43:11,783 --> 00:43:14,310
I'm not like my mom or you

632
00:43:14,310 --> 00:43:18,059
feeding the hungry
out of some noble sense of duty.

633
00:43:18,914 --> 00:43:21,201
I just want to make money.

634
00:43:23,500 --> 00:43:27,926
Clinging to profit like that is
the behavior of small-minded people.

635
00:43:28,889 --> 00:43:31,212
You talk like such a free spirit.

636
00:43:33,747 --> 00:43:35,648
Maybe in Joseon,
being born into a noble family

637
00:43:35,648 --> 00:43:39,330
meant you could scoff at money, but here!

638
00:43:39,330 --> 00:43:41,918
Money makes you noble.

639
00:43:41,918 --> 00:43:44,441
The rich are the kings with power.

640
00:43:46,231 --> 00:43:49,207
You need money to be treated like a person.

641
00:43:49,974 --> 00:43:52,908
Without it, even the living get left to die.

642
00:43:54,078 --> 00:43:58,218
This is the reality of
your so-called paradise, Yuldoguk.

643
00:44:00,071 --> 00:44:03,503
So stop talking and start cooking.

644
00:44:03,503 --> 00:44:05,699
I refuse to go down like this.

645
00:44:07,639 --> 00:44:12,175
So, in the end,
I'm just your means to make money?

646
00:44:12,175 --> 00:44:13,996
If that's the case…

647
00:44:14,663 --> 00:44:17,036
I don't want to be used anymore.

648
00:44:26,530 --> 00:44:29,725
I'm struggling too, you know.

649
00:44:53,931 --> 00:44:58,000
But here, money makes you noble.

650
00:44:58,000 --> 00:45:00,649
The rich are the kings with power.

651
00:45:02,378 --> 00:45:05,366
You need money
to be treated like a person.

652
00:45:06,105 --> 00:45:08,936
Without it, even the living get left to die.

653
00:45:11,592 --> 00:45:15,643
This is the reality of
your so-called paradise, Yuldoguk.

654
00:45:19,284 --> 00:45:23,802
Does the world I dreamed of
not exist even in the future?

655
00:45:39,567 --> 00:45:41,117
Bungeoppang!

656
00:45:53,806 --> 00:45:56,737
So this is how they're made.

657
00:45:56,737 --> 00:45:59,764
The same flour batter and red bean filling

658
00:45:59,764 --> 00:46:03,043
but if you use a fish-shaped mold,
it's bungeoppang.

659
00:46:03,043 --> 00:46:05,846
A chrysanthemum mold makes gukhwa-ppang.

660
00:46:05,846 --> 00:46:09,416
And a walnut mold makes Hodugwaja.

661
00:46:10,117 --> 00:46:11,391
Is that so?

662
00:46:11,391 --> 00:46:13,452
That's fascinating.

663
00:46:14,172 --> 00:46:17,386
How they are baked determines their names.

664
00:46:22,479 --> 00:46:24,519
Give me ten fish-shaped ones.

665
00:46:34,241 --> 00:46:37,319
I need to deliver them
before they get cold, so...

666
00:46:39,008 --> 00:46:41,923
Then, what mold are you in now?

667
00:46:41,923 --> 00:46:45,795
Are you really okay with it changing your name.

668
00:46:57,360 --> 00:46:58,970
Where did he go?

669
00:47:00,350 --> 00:47:02,433
Where did that old man go?

670
00:47:02,433 --> 00:47:04,387
Old man?

671
00:47:04,387 --> 00:47:06,901
The old man who made these for me.

672
00:47:06,901 --> 00:47:09,761
You bought them from me just now.

00:47:29,085 --> 00:47:30,955
Where should I install it?

675
00:47:32,578 --> 00:47:34,308
Signboard...

676
00:47:36,403 --> 00:47:38,865
Just leave it there.

677
00:47:38,865 --> 00:47:41,029
Aren't you going to install it?

678
00:47:41,755 --> 00:47:43,551
Please leave it there.

679
00:47:43,551 --> 00:47:46,531
Okay. Then, I'll leave it here.
