1
00:01:06,031 --> 00:01:07,365
You're here again.

2
00:01:07,365 --> 00:01:08,423
Sorry?

3
00:01:08,934 --> 00:01:11,425
Americano coffee with
an extra shot, right?

4
00:01:13,505 --> 00:01:14,972
Espresso...

5
00:01:20,679 --> 00:01:22,306
Do you come here every day?

6
00:01:23,482 --> 00:01:27,319
Um... yeah.

7
00:01:27,319 --> 00:01:29,287
I live just across the street.

8
00:01:50,141 --> 00:01:51,108
Honey!

9
00:01:52,277 --> 00:01:54,211
Sorry I'm late.

10
00:02:13,899 --> 00:02:16,231
She was about to become his wife.

11
00:02:19,471 --> 00:02:23,430
I returned to Canada and during
my research on marine life,

12
00:02:23,875 --> 00:02:27,777
I was swept away in the rapids
and I fell into a coma.

13
00:02:29,180 --> 00:02:31,080
The day I woke up,

14
00:02:31,216 --> 00:02:32,740
they were married.

15
00:02:37,956 --> 00:02:39,890
Do twins share destiny also?

16
00:02:41,893 --> 00:02:46,057
He was injured in the mountain
and like me, he fell into a coma.

17
00:02:47,232 --> 00:02:49,723
When I met her again,

18
00:02:52,804 --> 00:02:57,764
She had become a wilted flower.

19
00:02:58,443 --> 00:03:01,640
Yeon, I'm sorry.
I'm so late.

20
00:03:25,236 --> 00:03:26,972
Today, it's Jin-woo and Yeon's
wedding day.

21
00:03:26,972 --> 00:03:29,107
This is where
we're getting married.

22
00:03:29,107 --> 00:03:31,575
Hello everyone.
I'll see you later.

23
00:03:47,892 --> 00:03:50,360
I, LEE Jin-woo, Mikael

24
00:03:50,528 --> 00:03:52,689
take you, Yeon,
to be my wife

25
00:03:52,764 --> 00:03:54,733
to have and to hold
from this day forward,

26
00:03:54,733 --> 00:03:57,168
in sickness and in health.

27
00:03:57,168 --> 00:04:02,007
To love and to cherish and
to be faithful until death part us.

28
00:04:02,007 --> 00:04:05,602
Please give a round of applause
to the bride and the groom.

29
00:04:13,585 --> 00:04:16,554
Please take this ring

30
00:04:16,655 --> 00:04:20,819
as a sign of my love
and faithfulness.

31
00:04:22,527 --> 00:04:24,654
What lovely hands she has.

32
00:04:26,197 --> 00:04:29,462
In the name of the Father,
the Son and the Holy Spirit.

33
00:04:36,608 --> 00:04:39,509
The ring is a bit small.

34
00:04:42,847 --> 00:04:45,281
He must have gained
a lot of weight.

35
00:04:47,485 --> 00:04:48,918
However,

36
00:04:49,654 --> 00:04:52,851
to make this wedding happen...

37
00:04:54,759 --> 00:04:57,284
Even if it only fits half way
that's enough.

38
00:04:57,662 --> 00:05:00,222
- Don't you agree?
- Yes!

39
00:05:24,389 --> 00:05:25,822
Mr. LEE!

40
00:05:27,358 --> 00:05:28,518
Say something.

41
00:05:28,626 --> 00:05:32,687
In all my life, I've never felt
happiness like I did today.

42
00:05:33,398 --> 00:05:35,423
Because of two reasons.

43
00:05:35,500 --> 00:05:38,628
First, today is the day that
I'll be with my true love,

44
00:05:38,770 --> 00:05:42,604
HA Yeon,
for the rest of my life.

45
00:05:43,541 --> 00:05:45,977
By the way, her name is Yeon,

46
00:05:45,977 --> 00:05:50,812
which means
'the girl who greets the dew'.

47
00:05:51,850 --> 00:05:52,817
Right?

48
00:05:52,817 --> 00:05:55,877
- Yeon, like Yeonsei University?
- Silly sausage.

49
00:05:56,020 --> 00:05:59,457
- You always get it mixed up.
- And I've just heard that

50
00:05:59,457 --> 00:06:00,947
Jin-ho,

51
00:06:03,895 --> 00:06:09,527
my younger brother,
has woken up from his coma.

52
00:06:25,583 --> 00:06:27,574
Yes, I'm sorry.

53
00:06:28,319 --> 00:06:30,184
I'll try to finish it
by this weekend.

54
00:06:31,156 --> 00:06:32,885
No, that's not it.

55
00:06:34,959 --> 00:06:38,622
I'm sorry. Please just give me
till the end of the week.

56
00:06:41,299 --> 00:06:45,292
It's been published
for more than 3 months.

57
00:06:47,038 --> 00:06:49,598
You need to pay me
so I can pay the bills.

58
00:06:50,809 --> 00:06:52,174
Hello?

59
00:06:57,816 --> 00:06:59,841
No. I didn't mean it
that way.

60
00:07:01,186 --> 00:07:02,983
Alright, I'll keep that in mind.

61
00:07:04,389 --> 00:07:05,720
Bye.

62
00:07:21,639 --> 00:07:25,973
We are expecting heavy rainfall
and typhoons again this year.

63
00:07:26,110 --> 00:07:28,746
The rainy season has
changed over the years.

64
00:07:28,746 --> 00:07:32,083
Yes it has. Recent variations
in weather patterns

65
00:07:32,083 --> 00:07:35,951
show that monsoon rains occur
after a swift seasonal change.

66
00:07:45,730 --> 00:07:47,197
Yeah, Mom?

67
00:07:47,966 --> 00:07:50,268
Do you even know
what he looks like?

68
00:07:50,268 --> 00:07:52,702
No, I've never seen him before.

69
00:07:52,804 --> 00:07:54,362
Then, how will you recognize him?

70
00:07:54,539 --> 00:07:56,307
Don't worry,
I'll recognize him.

71
00:07:56,307 --> 00:07:58,537
They must look alike
if they're brothers.

72
00:07:58,776 --> 00:07:59,936
Alight.

73
00:08:00,445 --> 00:08:03,147
Thanks mom.
Please take good care of him.

74
00:08:03,147 --> 00:08:04,910
Don't worry.
Drive back safely.

75
00:08:25,336 --> 00:08:27,327
Frankfurt...

76
00:08:29,007 --> 00:08:30,872
San Francisco...

77
00:09:04,542 --> 00:09:05,668
HA Yeon?

78
00:09:12,784 --> 00:09:14,308
Are you HA Yeon?

79
00:09:19,757 --> 00:09:21,224
Yeon?

80
00:09:23,895 --> 00:09:28,696
Who... are you?

81
00:09:41,546 --> 00:09:43,446
HA Yeon...

82
00:09:45,750 --> 00:09:47,809
Yeon...

83
00:09:49,587 --> 00:09:50,679
Yeon?

84
00:09:54,125 --> 00:09:56,753
Are you okay to drive?

85
00:10:28,860 --> 00:10:30,088
Jin-woo...

86
00:10:33,564 --> 00:10:35,327
I'm sorry.

87
00:10:39,070 --> 00:10:40,867
I'm sorry for being late.

88
00:10:44,742 --> 00:10:46,607
I'm so sorry.

89
00:10:56,721 --> 00:10:59,451
It seems like
he has lost some weight.

90
00:11:10,902 --> 00:11:12,460
I'm sorry, Jin-woo.

91
00:11:12,870 --> 00:11:14,929
Sorry... Jin-ho.

92
00:11:24,449 --> 00:11:25,746
This tree...

93
00:11:26,217 --> 00:11:28,742
Me and my brother planted it
when we were little.

94
00:11:28,920 --> 00:11:31,582
It was dying
when I saw it two years ago.

95
00:11:34,859 --> 00:11:36,850
We liked playing this game.

96
00:11:39,964 --> 00:11:44,128
Surprising people by hiding the
fact that we're twin brothers.

97
00:12:09,026 --> 00:12:12,689
There are some good lines
in the book that you translated.

98
00:12:13,131 --> 00:12:14,996
To have hope...

99
00:12:15,566 --> 00:12:18,501
Throw it in the trash can.

100
00:12:23,107 --> 00:12:24,699
It's all a lie.

101
00:12:25,376 --> 00:12:28,140
That our destiny is
to endure through time.

102
00:12:28,479 --> 00:12:31,209
And that hope rises from
the ashes of despair.

103
00:12:32,350 --> 00:12:33,942
It's too cruel.

104
00:12:38,523 --> 00:12:41,492
They're the words of a person who
hasn't tasted the bitterness of life.

105
00:12:42,593 --> 00:12:44,185
Like these people.

106
00:12:50,801 --> 00:12:52,666
That's so cruel.

107
00:12:58,309 --> 00:13:01,379
Then think of something cheerful.

108
00:13:01,379 --> 00:13:04,109
For instance, what you'd like
to do when Jin-woo wakes up.

109
00:13:09,987 --> 00:13:11,318
Yeon, are you alright?

110
00:13:14,125 --> 00:13:16,685
You wanna go?
It's such a waste...

111
00:13:54,966 --> 00:13:57,230
Geez! Even a cockroach could
starve to death.

112
00:14:23,394 --> 00:14:25,055
Will this be enough?

113
00:14:25,229 --> 00:14:27,254
You need a proper meal.

114
00:14:29,667 --> 00:14:32,329
Isn't bread part of a meal
in Canada?

115
00:14:35,439 --> 00:14:37,430
Why do you use my first name?

116
00:14:38,409 --> 00:14:41,173
Why aren't you
calling me Mrs. LEE?

117
00:14:44,015 --> 00:14:47,075
Then shouldn't you call me
with more courtesy, too?

118
00:14:49,754 --> 00:14:51,346
Excuse me.

119
00:14:51,622 --> 00:14:54,090
How much would it cost
to run a place like this?

120
00:14:57,094 --> 00:14:58,584
I just...

121
00:14:59,397 --> 00:15:01,228
thought it would be nice

122
00:15:01,399 --> 00:15:05,062
for the three of us to run
a place like that together.

123
00:15:10,241 --> 00:15:12,835
That is,
if things were different.

124
00:15:28,292 --> 00:15:30,760
Where was I?

125
00:15:33,564 --> 00:15:36,934
The appearance of his wife,
holding a blue umbrella,

126
00:15:36,934 --> 00:15:39,027
looked unfamiliar to him.

127
00:15:40,104 --> 00:15:44,473
Never have I seen her walk
so cheerfully like that.

128
00:15:46,010 --> 00:15:49,537
Like a little girl, she stepped
lightly as she walked.

129
00:15:49,647 --> 00:15:54,584
She turned many corners and
headed towards an unknown place.

130
00:15:58,389 --> 00:16:01,722
He became enraptured
by the sense of mystery.

131
00:16:01,826 --> 00:16:05,557
And almost lost his wife
at an intersection.

132
00:16:43,634 --> 00:16:45,295
C'mon, wake up.

133
00:16:54,578 --> 00:16:56,068
Wake up!

134
00:17:00,451 --> 00:17:01,975
Please, wake up.

135
00:17:03,220 --> 00:17:04,744
Jin-woo.

136
00:17:05,289 --> 00:17:06,881
Move your hands like this.

137
00:17:07,925 --> 00:17:09,392
Please move.

138
00:17:33,584 --> 00:17:35,984
How long are you
going to stay like that?

139
00:17:39,023 --> 00:17:40,923
Why are you doing this to me?

140
00:17:52,303 --> 00:17:54,533
Jin-woo, please wake up.

141
00:17:57,475 --> 00:17:59,409
Let's go shopping together.

142
00:18:00,478 --> 00:18:02,412
Have afternoon naps.

143
00:18:04,648 --> 00:18:07,344
Eat in the market stalls.

144
00:18:10,221 --> 00:18:14,681
Drink beer and
watch PLEIN SOLEIL together.

145
00:18:18,362 --> 00:18:21,456
Can we do that?

146
00:18:30,541 --> 00:18:33,203
Former priests passed
down this saying...

147
00:18:37,047 --> 00:18:40,039
that smoking after every meal
will give you eternal life.

148
00:18:45,389 --> 00:18:47,625
Few days ago, I was
watching the world news.

149
00:18:47,625 --> 00:18:49,217
In China,

150
00:18:49,627 --> 00:18:53,961
the country is so big and full of
people, strange things happen.

151
00:18:54,365 --> 00:18:56,856
Some girl in a coma
suddenly woke up.

152
00:18:56,967 --> 00:18:58,264
Just like that.

153
00:18:58,536 --> 00:19:02,063
The reason was

154
00:19:02,773 --> 00:19:06,539
her mom playing her daughter's
favourite Korean music

155
00:19:06,677 --> 00:19:09,578
on full blast.

156
00:19:09,914 --> 00:19:11,482
My goodness!

157
00:19:11,482 --> 00:19:12,881
Miracles!

158
00:19:13,350 --> 00:19:15,250
Sometimes do happen.

159
00:19:15,386 --> 00:19:18,514
- What's important is faith.
- Faith in what?

160
00:19:20,024 --> 00:19:22,458
Faith in love!

161
00:19:23,260 --> 00:19:26,991
Do you think my love
isn't strong enough?

162
00:19:28,933 --> 00:19:30,167
Lucky you.

163
00:19:30,167 --> 00:19:33,466
Now you have to take care
of your brother-in-law too.

164
00:19:33,671 --> 00:19:36,774
When you told me you were getting
married after dating for 2 months

165
00:19:36,774 --> 00:19:38,275
I should've stopped you.

166
00:19:38,275 --> 00:19:40,244
Mom, stop it, will you?

167
00:19:40,244 --> 00:19:42,179
What? What?

168
00:19:42,179 --> 00:19:43,737
Did I say something wrong?

169
00:19:43,847 --> 00:19:48,385
You're not exactly
living a happy life

170
00:19:48,385 --> 00:19:51,149
when he's lying there
like a vegetable.

171
00:19:52,456 --> 00:19:54,356
But, you know...

172
00:19:54,592 --> 00:19:57,993
I wouldn't be here
if Jin-woo hadn't saved me.

173
00:19:59,597 --> 00:20:01,189
I guess...

174
00:20:02,499 --> 00:20:05,662
I don't know what I'm doing.

175
00:20:08,572 --> 00:20:10,441
Isn't he uncle's friend?

176
00:20:10,441 --> 00:20:13,899
I noticed
the way you look at him.

177
00:20:14,178 --> 00:20:15,975
Are you crazy?

178
00:20:16,113 --> 00:20:18,274
You're talking nonsense!

179
00:20:18,515 --> 00:20:22,611
I'm just saying, he looked good,
especially his broad shoulders!

180
00:20:22,720 --> 00:20:23,921
- You little...
- Ouch!

181
00:20:23,921 --> 00:20:25,081
He's a priest for god's sake!

182
00:20:40,337 --> 00:20:41,895
Mr. LEE,

183
00:20:44,541 --> 00:20:50,377
Do you remember who I am?

184
00:20:52,950 --> 00:20:54,577
In the mountain,

185
00:20:57,521 --> 00:21:00,251
when you tided my shoe laces...

186
00:21:01,325 --> 00:21:06,627
I thought that
you were my true love.

187
00:21:08,298 --> 00:21:09,856
But because of her...

188
00:21:11,835 --> 00:21:13,234
But...

189
00:21:17,341 --> 00:21:19,434
I wanted you to be happy.

190
00:21:33,924 --> 00:21:35,755
I'm sorry.

191
00:23:13,724 --> 00:23:16,989
Congratulations Mr. LEE.

192
00:23:18,862 --> 00:23:22,889
I remember you once said that
you preferred mountains to women.

193
00:23:25,936 --> 00:23:28,131
Mr. LEE... I...

194
00:23:28,939 --> 00:23:31,874
I'm thankful for
having known you.

195
00:23:59,870 --> 00:24:00,962
Yeon.

196
00:24:15,452 --> 00:24:16,578
Yeon!

197
00:24:16,987 --> 00:24:19,717
Yeon? Yeon?

198
00:24:20,324 --> 00:24:21,222
Yeon.

199
00:24:32,603 --> 00:24:34,371
To love and to cherish,

200
00:24:34,371 --> 00:24:38,205
and I promise to be faithful
to you until death parts us.

201
00:24:42,946 --> 00:24:46,040
The ring is a bit small.

202
00:24:49,519 --> 00:24:50,383
But...

203
00:25:02,966 --> 00:25:04,263
2 years ago...

204
00:25:05,502 --> 00:25:10,633
I passed out after
I got lost in the mountains.

205
00:25:12,109 --> 00:25:15,738
It was Jin-woo who saved my life.

206
00:25:18,582 --> 00:25:19,913
Destiny...

207
00:25:20,250 --> 00:25:24,118
If there was such a thing,
I thought he was the one for me.

208
00:25:48,412 --> 00:25:49,572
Excuse me.

209
00:25:50,781 --> 00:25:51,839
Excuse me.

210
00:25:53,350 --> 00:25:54,442
Are you ok?

211
00:26:16,873 --> 00:26:20,741
Come throw a dart and get
a free pack of toothpaste!

212
00:26:21,011 --> 00:26:23,673
It will give you young
and healthy teeth.

213
00:26:23,914 --> 00:26:26,906
That was close!
Try it again.

214
00:26:27,451 --> 00:26:28,884
Better luck next time.

215
00:26:33,190 --> 00:26:34,782
You have one more to go.

216
00:26:39,696 --> 00:26:44,565
Who's next? Any volunteers?

217
00:26:45,035 --> 00:26:48,129
Wow! The handsome man
over there.

218
00:26:48,405 --> 00:26:50,669
He has really long limbs.

219
00:26:50,807 --> 00:26:54,800
Use those long arms and

220
00:26:55,979 --> 00:26:58,709
throw the dart to win the prize!

221
00:27:06,923 --> 00:27:10,791
He's finally back from
his business trip.

222
00:27:11,361 --> 00:27:13,397
He's been away for quite a while.

223
00:27:13,397 --> 00:27:14,329
Yes!

224
00:27:18,602 --> 00:27:20,661
A family set!

225
00:27:24,307 --> 00:27:25,475
Congratulations!

226
00:27:25,475 --> 00:27:28,745
It's the first time anyone
has won this prize.

227
00:27:28,745 --> 00:27:30,881
Please come and collect
your family toothpaste set.

228
00:27:30,881 --> 00:27:31,915
Congratulations!

229
00:27:31,915 --> 00:27:32,783
Thank you.

230
00:27:32,783 --> 00:27:34,384
Looks like you've
got one too many.

231
00:27:34,384 --> 00:27:35,919
- Do you want one?
- No, it's okay.

232
00:27:35,919 --> 00:27:37,011
Congratulations!

233
00:27:41,425 --> 00:27:43,222
What's wrong?

234
00:27:44,428 --> 00:27:46,828
I'm late.
I've got to go to the hospital.

235
00:27:47,164 --> 00:27:49,962
It's you who needs
to see the doctor.

236
00:27:50,300 --> 00:27:51,902
I made an appointment.
I'll go with you.

237
00:27:51,902 --> 00:27:53,130
I'm fine.

238
00:27:56,506 --> 00:27:58,303
No, you're not!

239
00:27:58,408 --> 00:28:00,433
Sorry, but please
leave my house.

240
00:28:00,644 --> 00:28:02,578
Or I will.

241
00:28:19,262 --> 00:28:21,822
PSYCHIATRIC CLINIC

242
00:28:28,905 --> 00:28:31,840
- What's wrong?
- He can't breathe.

243
00:28:32,008 --> 00:28:33,407
What happened?

244
00:28:33,677 --> 00:28:37,078
I couldn't contact you
because your phone was off.

245
00:28:46,123 --> 00:28:47,647
Consent form for what?

246
00:28:48,158 --> 00:28:51,628
The truth is, no one knows
if he will make it.

247
00:28:51,628 --> 00:28:54,893
For now, he's in the ICU.

248
00:28:55,031 --> 00:28:57,522
We'll monitor
his progress carefully.

249
00:28:58,268 --> 00:29:00,964
The nurse will take care
of him from now on.

250
00:29:02,205 --> 00:29:04,264
You're telling me to
just stand by and watch?

251
00:29:19,823 --> 00:29:21,723
When he wakes up,

252
00:29:22,392 --> 00:29:26,385
I want to go on a trip with him.

253
00:29:28,365 --> 00:29:30,560
To somewhere quiet.

254
00:29:34,070 --> 00:29:36,129
If we get hungry on the way

255
00:29:36,940 --> 00:29:41,673
we'll find somewhere
by the road and have a nice meal.

256
00:29:43,914 --> 00:29:46,075
When we wake up in the morning,

257
00:29:47,250 --> 00:29:49,548
we'll look up at the clear sky.

258
00:29:50,020 --> 00:29:51,248
I'm sorry.

259
00:29:56,626 --> 00:29:58,150
Jin-woo...

260
00:29:59,229 --> 00:30:02,221
really wanted to make you happy.

261
00:30:09,072 --> 00:30:10,539
Don't worry.

262
00:30:11,575 --> 00:30:14,203
I'll put in a claim for
damages and expenses.

263
00:30:14,544 --> 00:30:15,841
All of it.

264
00:30:19,316 --> 00:30:20,783
That thing...

265
00:30:22,919 --> 00:30:24,682
Can I do it for you instead?

266
00:31:45,035 --> 00:31:47,697
First, move the couch
close to the window.

267
00:31:48,838 --> 00:31:52,205
Oh! Turn it towards
the tree outside.

268
00:31:53,743 --> 00:31:55,210
It's a bit heavy, isn't it?

269
00:31:56,780 --> 00:32:00,580
Now, look at the branches
shaking in the wind.

270
00:32:03,853 --> 00:32:06,117
Pull the blanket
up to your shoulder.

271
00:32:06,356 --> 00:32:12,056
Now... slowly, fall asleep.

272
00:32:15,031 --> 00:32:19,798
One, two, three...

273
00:32:39,255 --> 00:32:41,723
I think I was too focused on
my pain.

274
00:32:45,128 --> 00:32:46,686
Thank you.

275
00:32:47,831 --> 00:32:49,594
It really worked.

276
00:32:53,036 --> 00:32:55,630
It took me 10 years
to master the secret.

277
00:33:01,144 --> 00:33:03,442
I'm going to meet someone.
Would you come with me?

278
00:33:04,314 --> 00:33:05,713
Who?

279
00:33:22,232 --> 00:33:23,631
Mom and Dad.

280
00:33:27,704 --> 00:33:29,501
I think my sister-in-law...

281
00:33:33,176 --> 00:33:37,704
shouldn't suffer any more
than she has already.

282
00:33:41,851 --> 00:33:43,910
You know what I mean, right?

283
00:34:09,145 --> 00:34:10,305
Now...

284
00:34:13,049 --> 00:34:14,812
I'm afraid of everything.

285
00:34:18,955 --> 00:34:20,183
Really...

286
00:34:23,560 --> 00:34:25,790
Will he ever wake up?

287
00:34:30,500 --> 00:34:33,264
Just like the time he saved me

288
00:34:34,270 --> 00:34:37,865
I believed that I could wake him.

289
00:34:41,411 --> 00:34:43,140
But, now...

290
00:34:44,881 --> 00:34:50,478
I sometimes think that I'm
the reason he won't wake up.

291
00:34:56,526 --> 00:34:57,891
Everything...

292
00:34:58,261 --> 00:35:01,230
- Everything is my fault.
- Don't be stupid.

293
00:35:28,758 --> 00:35:30,123
Don't touch me.

294
00:35:31,394 --> 00:35:32,759
It looks like a sprain.

295
00:35:33,663 --> 00:35:35,563
Well done.
Now, look what you've done!

296
00:35:36,199 --> 00:35:37,894
Stop moving.

297
00:35:38,334 --> 00:35:40,632
I could just leave you here.

298
00:35:42,138 --> 00:35:44,470
Go then!
Just leave me alone!

299
00:35:46,075 --> 00:35:48,407
I don't want to be carried
by anyone ever again!

300
00:35:55,385 --> 00:35:57,785
I never thought I would
have to carry you again.

301
00:35:59,656 --> 00:36:01,487
What do you mean?

302
00:36:05,962 --> 00:36:07,725
What do you mean by that?

303
00:36:59,716 --> 00:37:01,911
ALFEIOS RIVER

304
00:37:23,873 --> 00:37:26,342
Water was the reason
you fell into a coma.

305
00:37:26,342 --> 00:37:28,333
Aren't you afraid?

306
00:37:33,716 --> 00:37:36,742
That's why I'm not going in
the water and just sitting here.

307
00:37:42,725 --> 00:37:45,091
Tell me something fun.

308
00:37:45,762 --> 00:37:47,252
Anything.

309
00:37:48,831 --> 00:37:52,267
I don't know any stories.

310
00:37:53,269 --> 00:37:55,863
Don't you know any folk tales?

311
00:38:03,346 --> 00:38:05,507
Once upon a time...

312
00:38:16,092 --> 00:38:18,117
There was a hunter

313
00:38:19,896 --> 00:38:21,830
who loved a woman.

314
00:38:27,370 --> 00:38:31,864
But the woman refused
to accept his love

315
00:38:32,442 --> 00:38:36,538
and turned into spring water.

316
00:38:37,113 --> 00:38:38,603
And then?

317
00:38:42,285 --> 00:38:45,948
The hunter
decided to become a river.

318
00:38:47,090 --> 00:38:49,752
To go through the oceans
towards the spring waters

319
00:38:50,793 --> 00:38:52,761
so he can be with her.

320
00:38:57,333 --> 00:38:59,267
That river is called
Alfeios River.

321
00:39:01,070 --> 00:39:03,231
The name of this lodge?

322
00:39:05,742 --> 00:39:07,209
But the interesting thing is...

323
00:39:07,510 --> 00:39:09,341
The spring water from Italy

324
00:39:09,479 --> 00:39:12,539
tastes exactly the same as
the river water in Greece.

325
00:39:12,849 --> 00:39:14,373
That's amazing.

326
00:39:15,718 --> 00:39:18,551
Do marine biologists have
to know that kind of stuff?

327
00:39:22,658 --> 00:39:24,387
Well, it is about water.

328
00:39:26,896 --> 00:39:28,329
But now,

329
00:39:29,332 --> 00:39:31,493
it doesn't interest me anymore.

330
00:39:35,538 --> 00:39:37,563
But you...

331
00:39:41,244 --> 00:39:43,474
You've become my only interest.

332
00:40:32,762 --> 00:40:34,320
Tell me the truth.

333
00:40:37,066 --> 00:40:39,330
Aren't you interested in me too?

334
00:40:42,238 --> 00:40:43,899
I remember now...

335
00:40:44,841 --> 00:40:47,366
what your eyes looked like.

336
00:41:21,677 --> 00:41:27,047
Wow! My daughter's clothes
fit you perfectly.

337
00:41:28,851 --> 00:41:35,188
Let me take a picture of you.
Believe me, I'm good at this.

338
00:41:35,358 --> 00:41:39,988
What's going on there?
Smile!

339
00:41:41,731 --> 00:41:44,256
Smile for goodness sake!

340
00:41:44,467 --> 00:41:46,935
Stop frowning
like some guilty person.

341
00:41:47,136 --> 00:41:51,505
Take two steps to the right.

342
00:41:53,209 --> 00:41:55,473
Come on.

343
00:41:56,112 --> 00:41:57,443
A little more.

344
00:41:57,747 --> 00:42:00,648
Ok, one, two.

345
00:42:35,017 --> 00:42:37,417
That place looks good.

346
00:42:51,869 --> 00:42:54,269
C'mon, do it properly.
What was that?

347
00:44:36,106 --> 00:44:40,042
Forbidden to love
the one I adore.

348
00:44:41,945 --> 00:44:45,745
Because to love her is a sin.

349
00:44:47,418 --> 00:44:51,377
I keep my love
hidden in my heart.

350
00:44:54,258 --> 00:44:55,691
Elisabeth,

351
00:44:56,427 --> 00:44:59,988
Who do you think would eat
more vegetables, me or a monk?

352
00:45:00,397 --> 00:45:04,834
Father, these vegetables aren't
that much as they look.

353
00:45:15,312 --> 00:45:17,872
I can do this by myself.

354
00:45:32,329 --> 00:45:36,834
I'll toss the vegetables
in the soup.

355
00:45:36,834 --> 00:45:40,702
And then I'll add a drop
of sesame oil to finish.

356
00:45:58,288 --> 00:46:03,089
Father above must
have felt pity on me.

357
00:46:03,360 --> 00:46:05,760
Watching me chain smoke
out of boredom.

358
00:46:07,030 --> 00:46:10,227
Maybe that's why
he sent you to me.

359
00:46:11,401 --> 00:46:14,393
But he doesn't seem to worry
about my potbelly like I do.

360
00:46:19,176 --> 00:46:20,143
Jin-ho! Watch out!

361
00:46:39,630 --> 00:46:41,120
Are you alright?

362
00:46:44,368 --> 00:46:45,767
Sorry.

363
00:47:12,596 --> 00:47:13,688
Anybody here?

364
00:48:00,711 --> 00:48:02,042
Get some rest.

365
00:48:35,579 --> 00:48:37,274
Why, can't you sleep?

366
00:48:51,561 --> 00:48:52,528
Yeon...

367
00:49:00,704 --> 00:49:03,298
Were you moved by my singing?

368
00:51:52,069 --> 00:51:56,301
When I saw that picture
in the diary

369
00:51:58,108 --> 00:52:00,042
I somehow knew...

370
00:52:00,677 --> 00:52:05,046
That this person was
going to be my husband.

371
00:52:09,920 --> 00:52:11,820
When you saw that little boy?

372
00:52:12,689 --> 00:52:17,626
Does that mean that I had your
picture with me all this time?

373
00:52:21,364 --> 00:52:25,198
Silly of you to carry it,
when he's right here.

374
00:52:27,471 --> 00:52:28,631
Look.

375
00:52:29,773 --> 00:52:32,571
My parents always put me
on Jin-woo's left.

376
00:52:32,709 --> 00:52:35,837
That's why my head
is slightly tilted to the right.

377
00:52:37,647 --> 00:52:38,807
Don't I look the same?

378
00:52:57,167 --> 00:52:58,998
I told you the things
I did...

379
00:53:01,037 --> 00:53:04,996
So, you wouldn't
have to feel guilty.

380
00:53:17,487 --> 00:53:18,545
Is it the hospital?

381
00:53:18,922 --> 00:53:20,048
Let me get it.

382
00:53:24,694 --> 00:53:25,888
Hello?

383
00:53:35,226 --> 00:53:36,557
Who is this?

384
00:53:37,261 --> 00:53:38,489
It's me...

385
00:53:43,768 --> 00:53:45,469
I think you've
got the wrong number.

386
00:53:45,469 --> 00:53:50,031
It's... me...

387
00:53:54,011 --> 00:53:55,672
Jin-woo.

388
00:54:03,159 --> 00:54:05,184
You're here!

389
00:54:05,628 --> 00:54:07,930
Where the hell have you been?

390
00:54:07,930 --> 00:54:08,964
Oh my God!

391
00:54:08,964 --> 00:54:12,229
Who would've guessed that
a miracle could happen here!

392
00:54:17,473 --> 00:54:22,467
You told me to call you
right away if he woke up.

393
00:54:22,745 --> 00:54:24,980
But I didn't know your number.

394
00:54:24,980 --> 00:54:27,039
If only I had it sooner...

395
00:54:44,667 --> 00:54:46,969
Where have you been
all this time?

396
00:54:46,969 --> 00:54:50,200
You weren't home
nor at the hospital.

397
00:55:06,355 --> 00:55:08,016
Excuse my late introduction.

398
00:55:08,290 --> 00:55:10,520
I'm Jin-ho,
Jin-woo's brother.

399
00:55:18,100 --> 00:55:19,294
Jin-woo.

400
00:55:25,941 --> 00:55:28,341
Yeon...

401
00:55:39,154 --> 00:55:40,519
Jin-woo.

402
00:55:54,770 --> 00:55:57,330
Relax your arm and
take it slow.

403
00:56:06,415 --> 00:56:08,007
A little more.

404
00:56:33,776 --> 00:56:40,648
The next piece is by the most
influential Italian composer,

405
00:56:40,749 --> 00:56:43,684
Giuseppe Verdi's DON CARLOS.

406
00:56:44,386 --> 00:56:49,949
And it tells the story about a man
who fell in love with a woman

407
00:56:50,559 --> 00:56:57,123
who was betrothed to his brother.

408
00:56:57,866 --> 00:56:58,867
Let's listen.

409
00:56:58,867 --> 00:57:00,129
Jin-ho.

410
00:57:00,436 --> 00:57:03,200
- Yes, Jin-woo?
- Give me your hand.

411
00:57:07,676 --> 00:57:11,077
I'm so glad that you're here.

412
00:57:13,182 --> 00:57:16,242
This is why it's great
to have a brother.

413
00:57:19,054 --> 00:57:21,022
After I'm discharged,

414
00:57:22,958 --> 00:57:26,189
shall we go on a trip together,
just three of us?

415
00:57:27,863 --> 00:57:33,460
You two have been through
a lot because of me.

416
00:57:35,404 --> 00:57:38,737
Let's think about it
when you're better.

417
00:58:46,075 --> 00:58:49,442
Slowly, right foot, left foot.

418
00:58:49,611 --> 00:58:51,914
Try not to go too fast.
Slowly now.

419
00:58:51,914 --> 00:58:53,905
Slowly now.
You're doing well.

420
00:58:54,216 --> 00:58:55,877
That's good.

421
00:59:32,654 --> 00:59:34,246
It's been a long time.

422
00:59:42,731 --> 00:59:44,494
It was you.

423
01:00:09,191 --> 01:00:11,989
Is she Jin-woo's woman?

424
01:00:18,233 --> 01:00:20,133
Is it really
that important to you?

425
01:00:23,572 --> 01:00:24,903
Is it?

426
01:01:06,315 --> 01:01:07,543
I'm a bastard, right?

427
01:02:00,202 --> 01:02:01,903
The rehab exercise
isn't over yet, is it?

428
01:02:01,903 --> 01:02:04,303
Um, no.
Not yet.

429
01:02:04,439 --> 01:02:07,374
No, he was on his way up
just now.

430
01:02:12,447 --> 01:02:15,041
You're so naive.

431
01:02:15,284 --> 01:02:17,479
There's no such thing
as unconditional love.

432
01:02:17,819 --> 01:02:21,846
But she's been so consistent.

433
01:02:22,157 --> 01:02:23,886
Do you know what I think?

434
01:02:25,227 --> 01:02:27,161
It's because of the jealousy.

435
01:02:27,462 --> 01:02:29,828
I still can't believe
she did that.

436
01:02:29,931 --> 01:02:31,796
Hey! Think about it.

437
01:02:32,134 --> 01:02:35,570
Imagine if your wife
was having an affair

438
01:02:35,570 --> 01:02:38,006
with your own twin brother.

439
01:02:38,006 --> 01:02:39,708
Wouldn't you wake up?

440
01:02:39,708 --> 01:02:42,233
Poor guy.

441
01:02:44,212 --> 01:02:47,015
Jealousy is scarier
than a miracle.

442
01:02:47,015 --> 01:02:48,778
Would you please bring me

443
01:02:49,351 --> 01:02:51,386
today's newspaper
to my room?

444
01:02:51,386 --> 01:02:52,683
Huh?

445
01:03:00,529 --> 01:03:01,655
Sure.

446
01:03:35,263 --> 01:03:36,423
Jin-woo...

447
01:03:37,933 --> 01:03:40,527
Don't you think it's too soon
to leave the hospital?

448
01:03:55,150 --> 01:03:57,584
It's okay.

449
01:04:10,399 --> 01:04:12,060
How does it feel?

450
01:04:12,167 --> 01:04:13,498
Coming home...

451
01:04:20,308 --> 01:04:22,333
We'll have to change
the wallpaper.

452
01:04:27,048 --> 01:04:28,481
Yeon.

453
01:04:29,384 --> 01:04:31,750
You know I hate this colour.

454
01:06:14,689 --> 01:06:17,123
I'm going to have some water.

455
01:07:17,986 --> 01:07:19,180
Yeon!

456
01:07:19,387 --> 01:07:20,285
Yes?

457
01:07:23,592 --> 01:07:25,924
The man...
who followed the woman...

458
01:07:35,303 --> 01:07:37,066
What happened next?

459
01:07:45,046 --> 01:07:47,810
It looks like you haven't
cut your hair for a while.

460
01:07:49,517 --> 01:07:51,485
Any style you'd like to try?

461
01:07:51,620 --> 01:07:55,886
Or you could try a trendy look.

462
01:07:59,361 --> 01:08:01,454
WHEN ARE YOU GOING TO TELL HIM?

463
01:08:36,798 --> 01:08:41,030
I thought you hated us
having the same hairstyle.

464
01:08:45,607 --> 01:08:50,067
Isn't your style
what's hot these days?

465
01:08:51,980 --> 01:08:56,781
I've been out for so long,
I didn't know what was trendy.

466
01:09:18,807 --> 01:09:21,367
0315.

467
01:09:23,144 --> 01:09:26,443
I saved it with our birthday
so it's easy to remember.

468
01:09:40,628 --> 01:09:41,925
Jin-ho.

469
01:09:44,599 --> 01:09:48,558
Do you remember playing the
game where we exchanged roles?

470
01:09:50,505 --> 01:09:52,607
When you came to Korea
a few years ago,

471
01:09:52,607 --> 01:09:55,176
You went hiking instead of me
'cause I had the flu.

472
01:09:55,176 --> 01:09:57,371
You told me that you scored
with some woman.

473
01:10:01,616 --> 01:10:02,981
What do you mean?

474
01:10:04,552 --> 01:10:08,818
You tied her laces and told her
that it was fate.

475
01:10:10,658 --> 01:10:14,617
Have you forgotten already?
She's even in my wedding video.

476
01:10:17,532 --> 01:10:22,162
After that, she came to me and
told me that she loves me.

477
01:10:23,204 --> 01:10:24,606
Really?

478
01:10:24,606 --> 01:10:26,597
I couldn't tell.

479
01:10:27,208 --> 01:10:28,937
If she loved me,

480
01:10:29,344 --> 01:10:35,650
or you.
I couldn't make it out.

481
01:10:35,650 --> 01:10:37,709
Why are you bringing it up
all of a sudden?

482
01:10:38,186 --> 01:10:40,021
I did it because of you.

483
01:10:40,021 --> 01:10:42,285
I wanted you to
meet some girls and...

484
01:10:43,825 --> 01:10:45,349
Jin-ho.

485
01:10:46,161 --> 01:10:50,689
We promised never to play
that kind of game again!

486
01:10:51,399 --> 01:10:52,764
Didn't we?

487
01:10:53,034 --> 01:10:57,061
You agreed that it's dangerous
to play that game!

488
01:10:58,306 --> 01:10:59,671
Right?

489
01:11:02,343 --> 01:11:03,640
I did.

490
01:11:04,345 --> 01:11:06,438
We're too old for playing games.

491
01:11:16,491 --> 01:11:18,152
As long as that's clear.

492
01:11:22,397 --> 01:11:23,955
And another thing.

493
01:11:25,600 --> 01:11:27,830
I think Yeon's feeling
a bit uneasy around us.

494
01:11:28,102 --> 01:11:31,128
Having two identical men
walking around in the same place.

495
01:11:32,841 --> 01:11:34,502
Do you like this place?

496
01:13:32,894 --> 01:13:34,122
Jin... ho?

497
01:13:35,897 --> 01:13:37,262
You're back.

498
01:13:38,800 --> 01:13:43,931
I guess I've lost some weight.
None of my clothes seem to fit.

499
01:13:44,739 --> 01:13:47,075
I think I look
alright in this style.

500
01:13:47,075 --> 01:13:49,373
What do you think?

501
01:13:52,814 --> 01:13:54,873
Why do you have to wear
your brother's clothes?

502
01:14:23,344 --> 01:14:25,013
YEON, YOU ARE THE ONE THAT I LIKE
MORE THAN MOUNTAIN

503
01:14:25,013 --> 01:14:26,947
MAYBE I WON'T GIVE THIS TO YOU
'CAUSE IT'S TOO CHEESEY

504
01:14:58,713 --> 01:15:01,375
I'll leave your towel
and underwear here.

505
01:15:03,618 --> 01:15:05,449
Could you scrub my back?

506
01:15:13,628 --> 01:15:15,095
That day,

507
01:15:15,997 --> 01:15:20,195
when you saved me
in the mountain.

508
01:15:23,337 --> 01:15:25,567
Your back smelled

509
01:15:27,675 --> 01:15:30,508
like some kinds of
soap fragrance.

510
01:15:32,780 --> 01:15:39,185
I didn't know a man could smell
the way that you did that day.

511
01:18:31,859 --> 01:18:34,828
Come out, Jin-ho.
The water's getting cold.

512
01:18:37,732 --> 01:18:39,700
What did you just call me?

513
01:18:41,602 --> 01:18:42,899
What?

514
01:18:43,404 --> 01:18:45,395
I called you Jin-woo.

515
01:18:52,513 --> 01:18:54,071
Who?

516
01:20:23,371 --> 01:20:26,238
Hello, I'm calling from the Seaworld.

517
01:20:48,095 --> 01:20:49,722
Thank you, come again.

518
01:21:18,859 --> 01:21:21,623
Jin-ho, it's me.

519
01:21:41,749 --> 01:21:43,216
I'm sorry.

520
01:21:44,852 --> 01:21:46,479
I can't do this anymore.

521
01:21:48,255 --> 01:21:51,520
I came to tell you this...

522
01:23:00,628 --> 01:23:02,152
I'm sorry.

523
01:23:05,332 --> 01:23:07,926
I missed you so much.

524
01:23:46,807 --> 01:23:48,206
That river...

525
01:23:49,877 --> 01:23:52,345
Is it true that
it can make love happen?

526
01:23:57,418 --> 01:24:00,148
I'm a bad woman, aren't I?

527
01:24:23,877 --> 01:24:26,038
Please vanish me away.

528
01:26:54,895 --> 01:26:55,987
Let me see.

529
01:27:38,405 --> 01:27:40,896
Jin-woo... Jin-ho...

530
01:27:59,059 --> 01:28:01,892
Yeon...

531
01:28:45,953 --> 01:28:47,477
Mom, are you out of your mind?

532
01:28:48,222 --> 01:28:49,712
Let's not do this right now.

533
01:28:50,524 --> 01:28:51,718
Pack your bags.

534
01:28:51,859 --> 01:28:54,128
- Let's go to my place.
- I don't want to go.

535
01:28:54,128 --> 01:28:56,530
- Come on, mom.
- I won't

536
01:28:56,530 --> 01:28:59,266
C'mon.
Let's go to my place.

537
01:28:59,266 --> 01:29:01,869
Why does it have to be
so difficult to love someone?

538
01:29:01,869 --> 01:29:03,632
Mom, he's a priest.

539
01:29:04,238 --> 01:29:06,729
It's not the priest that I love.

540
01:29:07,708 --> 01:29:10,541
The man I love
just happens to be a priest.

541
01:29:11,078 --> 01:29:12,670
Why must you do this to me too?

542
01:29:15,049 --> 01:29:17,040
Why...

543
01:29:50,417 --> 01:29:52,442
YOU HAVE RECEIVED A MESSAGE.

544
01:29:55,990 --> 01:30:01,929
Jin-woo, now that you're back,
I'll be returning to my own life.

545
01:30:03,831 --> 01:30:06,425
I'm sorry for
leaving so suddenly.

546
01:30:07,401 --> 01:30:08,959
Take care of yourself.

547
01:30:10,771 --> 01:30:12,432
Make your wife happy.

548
01:30:13,440 --> 01:30:14,407
Bye.

549
01:30:59,019 --> 01:31:00,421
Jin-woo?

550
01:31:00,421 --> 01:31:03,788
I just got your message.

551
01:31:05,092 --> 01:31:08,687
You won't be back
for a few years.

552
01:31:08,929 --> 01:31:11,659
So we should go
to see mom and dad.

553
01:31:13,167 --> 01:31:16,967
Are you sure?
You're not fully recovered yet.

554
01:31:18,205 --> 01:31:20,036
Well, you'll be with me,
so it's okay.

555
01:31:21,609 --> 01:31:23,736
It's been a long time
since I visited them.

556
01:31:23,844 --> 01:31:27,871
You haven't visited them yet,
have you?

557
01:31:31,285 --> 01:31:32,513
I'll see you then.

558
01:32:01,115 --> 01:32:05,252
3 people have gone missing
so far.

559
01:32:05,252 --> 01:32:08,653
Approximately 2000 houses
were damaged in torrential rains.

560
01:32:08,756 --> 01:32:15,355
The amount of damage is
expected to increase.

561
01:32:15,729 --> 01:32:22,191
The storm will get worse in the
afternoon with strong winds.

562
01:33:02,876 --> 01:33:05,401
There's someone
here for you, miss.

563
01:33:05,512 --> 01:33:06,604
Alright.

564
01:33:16,557 --> 01:33:20,459
Are you sure that
Jin-ho is your true love?

565
01:33:22,963 --> 01:33:25,864
You don't have to hide it,
just tell me.

566
01:33:29,002 --> 01:33:33,574
Are you still wasting your time
looking for your soul mate?

567
01:33:33,574 --> 01:33:34,675
Don't mock me.

568
01:33:34,675 --> 01:33:37,269
So, you still believe
it's important.

569
01:33:37,644 --> 01:33:41,045
Whether he's your soul mate
or not.

570
01:33:42,950 --> 01:33:46,613
Do you think
that I don't know?

571
01:33:46,954 --> 01:33:48,615
You think you do?

572
01:33:51,024 --> 01:33:54,425
Then how come you're still
wandering about in a dream

573
01:33:55,095 --> 01:33:57,495
after making such a big mistake?

574
01:33:59,400 --> 01:34:01,300
Big...

575
01:34:09,543 --> 01:34:11,511
I never knew that I would
have to carry you again.

576
01:34:12,146 --> 01:34:13,204
I'm a bastard, right?

577
01:34:23,056 --> 01:34:24,523
Mistake!

578
01:34:26,427 --> 01:34:27,985
She's pretty, isn't she?

579
01:34:28,262 --> 01:34:30,127
I met her in the mountain.

580
01:34:30,531 --> 01:34:32,465
I wish you could
come to my wedding.

581
01:34:39,740 --> 01:34:41,435
Come on.
Let's move down quickly.

582
01:34:43,210 --> 01:34:45,474
There's going to be a
heavy rain soon.

583
01:35:04,364 --> 01:35:08,061
Jin-woo, where are you going?

584
01:35:10,003 --> 01:35:11,129
Jin-woo.

585
01:36:03,023 --> 01:36:04,991
Which one of us saved Yeon?

586
01:36:07,361 --> 01:36:10,296
Who saved Yeon on this mountain?

587
01:36:13,166 --> 01:36:14,633
Why did you do it?

588
01:36:15,035 --> 01:36:20,029
Why did you have to lie,
and steal my wife from me?

589
01:36:26,914 --> 01:36:28,814
This picture hanging in her car.

590
01:36:29,616 --> 01:36:32,642
She said the little boy looked
like her soul-mate.

591
01:36:32,786 --> 01:36:34,720
It's because that boy was me.

592
01:36:34,821 --> 01:36:37,517
You think that gave you the right?
Son of a bitch.

593
01:37:19,433 --> 01:37:21,230
When I saw her at the hospital,

594
01:37:23,904 --> 01:37:26,634
she looked like a wilted flower.

595
01:37:27,808 --> 01:37:29,867
It hurt to see her like that.

596
01:37:30,644 --> 01:37:33,306
I wanted to make her
feel alive again.

597
01:37:35,616 --> 01:37:38,210
To make her feel alive again?

598
01:37:40,654 --> 01:37:44,954
Why don't you admit that you
just wanted to fuck my wife!

599
01:37:46,159 --> 01:37:47,592
I'm sorry, Jin-woo.

600
01:37:48,395 --> 01:37:49,419
I'm sorry.

601
01:37:55,002 --> 01:37:56,492
Don't flatter yourself!

602
01:37:56,970 --> 01:38:00,907
She only accepted you
because you look like me.

603
01:38:00,907 --> 01:38:03,102
As long as you have my face

604
01:38:03,543 --> 01:38:05,704
whatever she felt was not love.

605
01:38:06,146 --> 01:38:09,673
She never loved you, you bastard.

606
01:38:20,694 --> 01:38:23,993
You hated the fact that
you had a twin brother

607
01:38:25,999 --> 01:38:29,264
enough to make you want to
hide my existence from Yeon.

608
01:38:59,199 --> 01:39:05,104
It would have been better
if we were the same person.

609
01:39:19,286 --> 01:39:20,776
Let's go down.

610
01:39:24,391 --> 01:39:25,915
Jin-woo, where are you going?

611
01:39:27,494 --> 01:39:29,792
Let's just go.
It's pouring down.

612
01:39:30,097 --> 01:39:33,294
Let's go.

613
01:39:34,501 --> 01:39:36,765
Let's just go.

614
01:39:37,037 --> 01:39:39,130
Do you think I'll give in?

615
01:39:40,240 --> 01:39:43,437
- You can leave!
- No! I'm not leaving you.

616
01:39:44,010 --> 01:39:46,740
Where are you going?
Let's just go down.

617
01:40:17,677 --> 01:40:18,939
Stop it and let's just go.

618
01:40:19,446 --> 01:40:20,435
Stop, Jin-woo...

619
01:40:34,628 --> 01:40:35,262
Please.

620
01:40:35,262 --> 01:40:36,854
Don't follow me.

621
01:40:39,065 --> 01:40:39,793
Jin-woo.

622
01:41:03,089 --> 01:41:04,750
Take care of her.

623
01:41:13,533 --> 01:41:14,334
Jin-woo!

624
01:41:14,334 --> 01:41:15,266
No!

625
01:41:15,535 --> 01:41:17,025
Jin-woo!

626
01:41:54,140 --> 01:41:55,334
Jin-woo!

627
01:41:57,010 --> 01:41:58,136
Jin-ho!

628
01:41:59,112 --> 01:42:00,443
Jin-woo!

629
01:42:03,049 --> 01:42:04,141
Jin-ho!

630
01:42:32,479 --> 01:42:37,484
Anyway, I'll live happily
with the woman I love

631
01:42:37,484 --> 01:42:38,951
and my brother

632
01:42:39,219 --> 01:42:42,746
forever and ever.

633
01:42:42,923 --> 01:42:43,912
Thank you.

634
01:43:31,504 --> 01:43:32,562
I'm here.

635
01:43:37,744 --> 01:43:41,348
Don't think I should be bossed
around by a bakery owner.

636
01:43:41,348 --> 01:43:43,441
I sell sandwiches.
Not bread.

637
01:43:43,750 --> 01:43:45,980
Whatever, they're the same to me.

638
01:43:46,886 --> 01:43:48,353
Is the manuscript ready?

639
01:43:50,523 --> 01:43:53,617
Do you even have time to write?

640
01:43:54,060 --> 01:43:57,052
Gas bills, health insurance.

641
01:43:57,397 --> 01:43:59,592
You should check your mail.

642
01:44:00,900 --> 01:44:02,492
Another parking ticket?

643
01:44:06,039 --> 01:44:07,199
What's this?

644
01:44:09,709 --> 01:44:11,142
A love letter?

645
01:44:13,146 --> 01:44:15,046
I'm not kidding.
Look.

646
01:45:36,496 --> 01:45:44,062
Which one of us
did you really love?

647
01:45:56,182 --> 01:45:58,309
The man I loved...

648
01:45:59,285 --> 01:46:00,718
Was you...

649
01:46:01,588 --> 01:46:04,022
It was you...
