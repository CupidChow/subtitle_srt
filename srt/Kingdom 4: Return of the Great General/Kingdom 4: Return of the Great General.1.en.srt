1
00:01:07,609 --> 00:01:08,526
<i>Hyo.</i>

2
00:01:09,736 --> 00:01:14,157
<i>This is our first step toward</i>
<i>the greatest general on Earth.</i>

3
00:01:14,240 --> 00:01:17,160
A BOY WHO DREAMS OF
BECOMING THE GREAT GENERAL, SHIN

4
00:01:34,594 --> 00:01:36,721
Zhao broke into our state?

5
00:01:36,805 --> 00:01:39,766
The Zhao Army is now headed towards Bayo.

6
00:01:39,849 --> 00:01:42,894
<i>Bayo is the key</i>
<i>to our front line. If it falls,</i>

7
00:01:42,977 --> 00:01:46,314
the Zhao Army
will penetrate deep into our state.

8
00:01:46,981 --> 00:01:48,733
Bring Shoheikun here.

9
00:01:48,817 --> 00:01:51,027
THE YOUNG KING OF QIN, EISEI

10
00:01:51,111 --> 00:01:53,446
I had already made a request
to General Ohki.

11
00:01:54,489 --> 00:01:56,825
To offer him the top position.

12
00:01:56,908 --> 00:01:59,869
You expect me to step down so easily?

13
00:02:00,662 --> 00:02:04,165
I am your army leader.
My decision will not be overturned.

14
00:02:04,249 --> 00:02:07,293
There's something I'd like to confirm.

15
00:02:07,836 --> 00:02:12,674
The reason why
you wish to unify all of China.

16
00:02:13,925 --> 00:02:15,677
<i>I made a promise.</i>

17
00:02:18,805 --> 00:02:20,014
<i>Not only for Shika.</i>

18
00:02:20,890 --> 00:02:23,643
For those who died protecting me.

19
00:02:24,853 --> 00:02:28,982
This is why I am on a journey
that no one's dared to go on.

20
00:02:30,817 --> 00:02:33,862
Why did you decide to participate, Ohki?

21
00:02:33,945 --> 00:02:36,739
Because of King Eisei's past story.

22
00:02:36,823 --> 00:02:40,702
I too, must come face to face
with my past.

23
00:02:40,785 --> 00:02:42,829
THE MONSTROUS BIRD OF QIN
AND ONE OF THE SIX GREAT GENERALS, OHKI

24
00:02:42,912 --> 00:02:46,708
<i>That's why you cannot</i>
<i>give up the land where Kyo fell.</i>

25
00:02:47,208 --> 00:02:48,126
BAYO CASTLE

26
00:02:48,209 --> 00:02:52,171
General Ohki, I appoint you
as our commander-in-chief.

27
00:02:53,131 --> 00:02:58,845
<i>Actually, I have something important</i>
<i>to convey to you.</i>

28
00:03:00,388 --> 00:03:03,057
A message from King Sho

29
00:03:03,808 --> 00:03:06,144
to you, King Eisei.

30
00:03:07,312 --> 00:03:09,314
From King Sho?

31
00:03:09,397 --> 00:03:11,941
I decided while you were gone.

32
00:03:12,775 --> 00:03:14,152
I'm going to war.

33
00:03:14,944 --> 00:03:15,778
<i>What?</i>

34
00:03:15,862 --> 00:03:17,155
A DESCENDANT OF THE MOUNTAIN TRIBE,
KARYOTEN

35
00:03:17,238 --> 00:03:18,948
With my brains.

36
00:03:19,657 --> 00:03:20,867
As a "Strategist."

37
00:03:21,451 --> 00:03:25,413
Up until now, we weren't aware of
any generals who could lead big armies.

38
00:03:26,581 --> 00:03:27,457
Generals?

39
00:03:27,540 --> 00:03:33,171
<i>Zhao once had the Three Great Heavens</i>
<i>but not anymore.</i>

40
00:03:33,254 --> 00:03:37,592
I guess it means,
a new general has appeared.

41
00:03:37,675 --> 00:03:40,303
I've finally found out
the whereabouts of that big shot.

42
00:03:41,012 --> 00:03:41,846
Shin?

43
00:03:41,930 --> 00:03:44,807
<i>It turns out he's been training</i>
<i>under Ohki.</i>

44
00:03:45,558 --> 00:03:47,268
<i>I'll give you a mission.</i>

45
00:03:47,852 --> 00:03:50,063
Show me what you've learned.

46
00:03:50,730 --> 00:03:55,902
<i>Your unit will charge from the side</i>
<i>where both armies are fighting</i>

47
00:03:55,985 --> 00:03:59,656
and amidst the confusion,
you will take Fuki's head.

48
00:04:00,448 --> 00:04:01,783
Kyokai!

49
00:04:06,829 --> 00:04:07,914
<i>Shin, go!</i>

50
00:04:11,793 --> 00:04:15,046
Hey, kid. Did our Lord name your unit?

51
00:04:15,129 --> 00:04:19,008
As of now, you will call your unit,
Hishin Unit.

52
00:04:21,052 --> 00:04:22,428
They're retreating.

53
00:04:22,512 --> 00:04:25,181
The Zhao Army has fled.

54
00:04:25,974 --> 00:04:26,808
Who are you?

55
00:04:26,891 --> 00:04:28,518
No need to be alarmed.

56
00:04:29,519 --> 00:04:31,271
<i>Our battle isn't over.</i>

57
00:04:31,354 --> 00:04:34,565
There's a man
who'll lead us to our victory.

58
00:04:36,234 --> 00:04:37,151
Let's get them.

59
00:04:37,235 --> 00:04:39,153
The farthest you can go

60
00:04:39,237 --> 00:04:43,449
is up to where you see Zhao's
former mountaintop headquarters.

61
00:04:44,117 --> 00:04:47,620
All of you. Never ever break this promise.

62
00:04:50,123 --> 00:04:54,085
Zhao's commander-in-chief
is a man called Hoken.

63
00:04:54,168 --> 00:04:56,587
We're not the only ones.

64
00:04:57,171 --> 00:05:00,425
<i>Some masters of martial arts</i>
<i>can do the same.</i>

65
00:05:00,508 --> 00:05:01,801
A DESCENDANT OF THE SHIYU ASSASSIN TRIBE,
KYOKAI

66
00:05:01,884 --> 00:05:03,428
<i>But what's more terrifying are</i>

67
00:05:03,511 --> 00:05:06,180
those who host god within.

68
00:05:08,516 --> 00:05:09,726
We called them

69
00:05:10,435 --> 00:05:11,978
Bushin "War God."

70
00:05:12,061 --> 00:05:14,147
I'll stop him. Run!

71
00:05:16,316 --> 00:05:18,151
Bro!

72
00:05:23,573 --> 00:05:25,408
<i>This is a fateful battle</i>

73
00:05:26,576 --> 00:05:28,870
<i>that goes back nine years.</i>

74
00:05:29,370 --> 00:05:31,372
<i>A war of vengeance.</i>

75
00:05:34,959 --> 00:05:35,960
Who the hell are you?

76
00:05:38,129 --> 00:05:41,382
I am Hoken, Bushin "War God."

77
00:05:42,800 --> 00:05:44,093
"Bushin"?

78
00:06:02,278 --> 00:06:05,323
Is he the "War God"
you were talking about?

79
00:06:05,823 --> 00:06:06,783
I don't know.

80
00:06:07,283 --> 00:06:10,953
But if it's the real "War God" stay away.

81
00:06:11,454 --> 00:06:13,664
That's what we were taught.

82
00:06:16,250 --> 00:06:21,422
I don't care who he is.
He killed my buddies.

83
00:06:22,590 --> 00:06:24,175
I'll never forgive him.

84
00:06:25,718 --> 00:06:27,178
Let's make him pay.

85
00:06:28,763 --> 00:06:30,098
Of course.

86
00:06:42,110 --> 00:06:44,028
What can we do?

87
00:06:44,112 --> 00:06:45,905
We're no help.

88
00:06:45,988 --> 00:06:48,991
You sure? They're up against a monster.

89
00:06:49,075 --> 00:06:52,829
But it's Shin and Kyokai together.

90
00:07:24,652 --> 00:07:25,778
Shin!

91
00:07:27,613 --> 00:07:28,364
Shin!

92
00:07:36,706 --> 00:07:38,249
Are you okay?

93
00:07:38,833 --> 00:07:40,001
Wake up.

94
00:07:41,085 --> 00:07:41,919
Shin!

95
00:07:42,503 --> 00:07:43,588
No good.

96
00:07:59,145 --> 00:08:00,980
To-on, tan-tan.

97
00:08:02,023 --> 00:08:03,900
To-on, tan-tan.

98
00:08:04,817 --> 00:08:09,155
Bounce…

99
00:08:10,698 --> 00:08:14,702
Bounce…

100
00:08:18,122 --> 00:08:21,918
Bounce…

101
00:08:22,543 --> 00:08:26,756
Bounce…

102
00:08:27,298 --> 00:08:28,758
Bounce…

103
00:08:29,842 --> 00:08:33,638
Bounce…

104
00:08:34,430 --> 00:08:38,142
Bounce…

105
00:08:38,935 --> 00:08:40,520
Bounce…

106
00:09:14,387 --> 00:09:15,888
-Shin!
-Shin!

107
00:09:15,972 --> 00:09:17,390
-Hey!
-Shin!

108
00:09:36,200 --> 00:09:37,994
-Kyokai!
-Kyokai!

109
00:09:39,328 --> 00:09:41,205
You okay, Kyokai?

110
00:09:42,456 --> 00:09:43,874
She looks bad.

111
00:09:52,842 --> 00:09:53,718
Run, Kyokai!

112
00:09:56,846 --> 00:09:57,930
Get away!

113
00:10:04,145 --> 00:10:05,688
Stop!

114
00:10:07,231 --> 00:10:08,065
Kyokai!

115
00:10:09,734 --> 00:10:12,153
-This isn't good.
-Kyokai.

116
00:10:39,263 --> 00:10:40,097
Kyokai!

117
00:10:47,355 --> 00:10:49,774
I came for my adversary.

118
00:10:50,691 --> 00:10:54,612
Only to find another enemy
who can summon god.

119
00:10:58,449 --> 00:11:00,534
Heavens' guide.

120
00:11:01,786 --> 00:11:05,748
But the Heavens fear only one being.

121
00:11:09,919 --> 00:11:12,463
It is I, Hoken alone.

122
00:11:22,098 --> 00:11:24,308
-Your spears!
-Got it!

123
00:11:24,392 --> 00:11:26,519
Get out your spears.

124
00:11:49,250 --> 00:11:50,709
Throw them, now!

125
00:12:11,939 --> 00:12:12,940
Gotcha!

126
00:12:36,255 --> 00:12:37,923
Commander Shin!

127
00:12:45,306 --> 00:12:46,849
No!

128
00:12:46,932 --> 00:12:48,476
-Shin!
-Shin!

129
00:13:04,116 --> 00:13:05,910
You okay, Bro?

130
00:13:16,629 --> 00:13:18,380
Protect Shin!

131
00:13:42,112 --> 00:13:43,072
Shin!

132
00:14:07,263 --> 00:14:10,391
What kind of monster is he?

133
00:14:13,435 --> 00:14:15,729
To all soldiers!

134
00:14:24,530 --> 00:14:27,658
He is the Zhao Army's
commander-in-chief, Hoken.

135
00:14:29,618 --> 00:14:30,619
What?

136
00:14:31,370 --> 00:14:34,999
That bastard is our enemy's
commander-in-chief?

137
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:40,045
A 100,000-man commander came here alone?

138
00:14:40,129 --> 00:14:42,131
Commander-in-chief…

139
00:14:43,257 --> 00:14:44,383
Hoken…

140
00:14:44,884 --> 00:14:46,635
He's right here.

141
00:14:47,386 --> 00:14:50,556
Take Hoken's head!

142
00:14:53,559 --> 00:14:54,560
Good grief.

143
00:15:04,695 --> 00:15:06,530
Not so fast.

144
00:15:07,823 --> 00:15:09,700
Charge!

145
00:15:11,118 --> 00:15:12,703
Get them.

146
00:15:18,876 --> 00:15:20,920
-They're coming.
-Take Shin.

147
00:15:21,003 --> 00:15:22,296
-Shin!
-They're here.

148
00:15:22,379 --> 00:15:23,213
Shin.

149
00:15:31,263 --> 00:15:32,431
Hurry.

150
00:15:37,853 --> 00:15:39,897
Unit, retreat!

151
00:15:39,980 --> 00:15:42,900
Hishin Unit, retreat!

152
00:15:42,983 --> 00:15:44,818
Hishin Unit!

153
00:15:44,902 --> 00:15:46,403
Hishin Unit?

154
00:15:48,405 --> 00:15:51,909
So, that's the unit that defeated Fuki.

155
00:16:08,092 --> 00:16:10,678
-How many did we lose?
-No idea.

156
00:16:11,887 --> 00:16:13,138
Where's Kyokai?

157
00:16:14,139 --> 00:16:18,185
I saw Ryusen carrying her,
but we've lost them.

158
00:16:19,311 --> 00:16:20,396
Why?

159
00:16:20,479 --> 00:16:24,316
We were having a good time talking silly.

160
00:16:24,817 --> 00:16:27,027
How could this happen to us?

161
00:16:27,111 --> 00:16:28,404
Quit whining.

162
00:16:28,487 --> 00:16:32,491
We were this close
to defeating the enemy commander.

163
00:16:33,200 --> 00:16:34,576
We sure were.

164
00:16:34,660 --> 00:16:36,870
We almost had him.

165
00:16:37,913 --> 00:16:40,290
Anyhow, Shin's amazing.

166
00:16:41,125 --> 00:16:43,002
A true commander.

167
00:16:44,420 --> 00:16:45,462
Yeah.

168
00:16:47,423 --> 00:16:48,632
Bito.

169
00:16:49,717 --> 00:16:51,677
Guard Shin with your life.

170
00:16:53,220 --> 00:16:56,598
As long as he survives,
our Hishin Unit will too.

171
00:16:57,725 --> 00:17:00,811
I know. Leave it to me.

172
00:17:07,568 --> 00:17:08,569
They're coming!

173
00:17:20,289 --> 00:17:22,458
Hishin Unit!

174
00:17:23,167 --> 00:17:25,878
Surround them! Every one of them.

175
00:17:51,028 --> 00:17:53,113
So, you're the leader.

176
00:17:53,197 --> 00:17:57,326
You've left gaps everywhere.

177
00:17:58,744 --> 00:18:03,582
We're the Hishin Unit
that defeated 20,000 of Fuki's men.

178
00:18:04,249 --> 00:18:08,504
Mess with us, and we'll chop off
that stupid head of yours!

179
00:18:12,674 --> 00:18:14,343
Try it.

180
00:18:17,805 --> 00:18:19,640
You know what to do.

181
00:18:30,234 --> 00:18:31,652
Guys.

182
00:18:34,071 --> 00:18:35,864
Run!

183
00:18:47,960 --> 00:18:50,879
They're letting us escape.

184
00:18:51,421 --> 00:18:52,714
Not us.

185
00:18:54,550 --> 00:18:55,843
It's Shin.

186
00:18:58,220 --> 00:19:01,557
-Let's go, Bito.
-Right.

187
00:19:05,519 --> 00:19:08,522
Are we not going after them?

188
00:19:09,022 --> 00:19:14,319
The leader who defeated Fuki was a brat.
He wasn't amongst that unit.

189
00:19:16,446 --> 00:19:18,115
Search for him!

190
00:19:18,198 --> 00:19:19,408
Yes, sir!

191
00:19:34,965 --> 00:19:35,799
Tohbi.

192
00:19:37,134 --> 00:19:38,260
Yuri.

193
00:19:40,429 --> 00:19:42,890
Praying for Bihei so late at night?

194
00:19:44,474 --> 00:19:46,435
You are too, Yuri.

195
00:20:01,783 --> 00:20:04,077
Ko's mom and grandma.

196
00:20:04,703 --> 00:20:07,956
Ko and Kei were recruited with Bito.

197
00:20:40,030 --> 00:20:43,575
Yuri. The thought scares me.

198
00:20:47,162 --> 00:20:48,497
Maybe…

199
00:20:50,499 --> 00:20:53,669
Bihei and his men are already gone.

200
00:20:56,046 --> 00:20:57,214
Don't worry.

201
00:20:58,048 --> 00:21:02,135
They're undependable,
but they get things done.

202
00:21:11,520 --> 00:21:13,522
Let them come back safely.

203
00:21:16,108 --> 00:21:17,651
Please.

204
00:21:21,905 --> 00:21:22,823
Bito.

205
00:21:56,815 --> 00:21:57,941
Bro!

206
00:21:58,567 --> 00:22:00,819
We ain't over yet.

207
00:22:01,320 --> 00:22:03,780
We can't end here.

208
00:22:04,573 --> 00:22:05,490
Bro!

209
00:22:33,185 --> 00:22:34,186
Bito.

210
00:22:35,854 --> 00:22:37,856
Is Shin's heart beating?

211
00:22:42,861 --> 00:22:43,779
It is.

212
00:22:45,030 --> 00:22:47,991
So's mine and yours too.

213
00:22:50,077 --> 00:22:52,287
Then Shin would say,

214
00:22:53,497 --> 00:22:55,624
"Nothing's over yet."

215
00:23:07,803 --> 00:23:08,887
Can you still walk?

216
00:23:11,223 --> 00:23:12,057
Sure.

217
00:23:17,020 --> 00:23:18,939
Then we'll part here.

218
00:23:27,072 --> 00:23:29,449
They're following our blood.

219
00:23:30,158 --> 00:23:33,537
I'll be a decoy and go off track.

220
00:23:34,037 --> 00:23:38,250
You stop your bleeding
with my strap and go.

221
00:23:39,876 --> 00:23:42,879
But then they'll go after you and…

222
00:23:42,963 --> 00:23:43,964
Bito!

223
00:23:45,298 --> 00:23:47,259
We need to protect Shin.

224
00:23:50,679 --> 00:23:52,472
As members of his unit,

225
00:23:54,015 --> 00:23:56,143
and as his homies.

226
00:23:59,896 --> 00:24:01,148
Bro!

227
00:24:06,361 --> 00:24:09,823
Don't give me that look.
I'll join you when I lose them.

228
00:24:10,407 --> 00:24:11,741
I won't die.

229
00:24:13,243 --> 00:24:15,287
Tohbi is waiting for me.

230
00:24:24,129 --> 00:24:25,714
Take care of Shin.

231
00:24:28,008 --> 00:24:28,884
Bito.

232
00:24:36,057 --> 00:24:36,975
I will.

233
00:24:59,789 --> 00:25:01,291
Still fresh.

234
00:25:04,544 --> 00:25:06,922
There are traces of blood.

235
00:25:08,632 --> 00:25:10,175
Two sets of footprints.

236
00:25:10,258 --> 00:25:13,511
They must be severely wounded.

237
00:25:14,596 --> 00:25:15,722
It's him.

238
00:25:17,182 --> 00:25:19,100
I'm sure of it.

239
00:25:19,601 --> 00:25:21,144
Follow the blood!

240
00:25:49,965 --> 00:25:51,549
We won't die.

241
00:25:52,676 --> 00:25:57,389
We Joto village men
are known for our sturdiness.

242
00:25:58,056 --> 00:25:59,641
Right, Shin?

243
00:26:36,386 --> 00:26:37,887
You've woken up.

244
00:26:39,180 --> 00:26:40,557
Hey, Bito.

245
00:26:41,182 --> 00:26:43,435
I dreamt about our village.

246
00:26:44,352 --> 00:26:45,770
Me too.

247
00:26:46,354 --> 00:26:49,733
I was thinking about the day we first met.

248
00:26:53,528 --> 00:26:54,696
Hoken…

249
00:26:55,363 --> 00:26:56,406
Hoken!

250
00:26:57,991 --> 00:26:59,701
Keep still for a while.

251
00:27:01,244 --> 00:27:04,873
What happened? Where am I, Bito?

252
00:27:06,791 --> 00:27:08,460
We're good for now.

253
00:27:09,169 --> 00:27:10,962
Just lie down.

254
00:27:30,607 --> 00:27:31,775
Yuri.

255
00:27:34,569 --> 00:27:35,779
You're here again.

256
00:27:36,446 --> 00:27:37,280
Yes.

257
00:27:42,535 --> 00:27:46,539
Somehow, I have a feeling
something's not right.

258
00:27:47,415 --> 00:27:48,666
You too?

259
00:28:13,650 --> 00:28:14,609
Then,

260
00:28:15,735 --> 00:28:18,863
you all risked your lives to get me out.

261
00:28:20,490 --> 00:28:21,908
Damn it.

262
00:28:22,951 --> 00:28:24,828
What am I doing?

263
00:28:28,998 --> 00:28:31,876
What happened to Kanoh? And Hoken?

264
00:28:32,377 --> 00:28:33,378
Shin.

265
00:28:36,881 --> 00:28:39,592
Let's not talk about it now.

266
00:28:42,721 --> 00:28:45,014
Thinking of Hoken

267
00:28:46,558 --> 00:28:49,853
might stop our wounds from healing.

268
00:28:52,355 --> 00:28:54,733
Bito, are you wounded?

269
00:28:54,816 --> 00:28:58,820
I'll be fine. It's not as bad as yours.

270
00:29:00,780 --> 00:29:04,868
What I wanna do right now
just for a while,

271
00:29:06,077 --> 00:29:08,037
is have a fun chat.

272
00:29:12,083 --> 00:29:12,959
Shin.

273
00:29:15,378 --> 00:29:18,465
Remember the first time we met?

274
00:29:19,758 --> 00:29:20,592
Huh?

275
00:29:22,844 --> 00:29:23,845
Yeah.

276
00:29:27,182 --> 00:29:32,604
Bihei started picking on me,
so I bashed your faces in.

277
00:29:35,648 --> 00:29:38,193
We were always busy fighting.

278
00:29:41,112 --> 00:29:44,073
You kept on about being a general.

279
00:29:44,616 --> 00:29:46,951
We all made fun of you.

280
00:29:47,035 --> 00:29:50,830
That's why I bashed
your faces in every time.

281
00:30:00,173 --> 00:30:01,090
Shin.

282
00:30:05,553 --> 00:30:07,555
Will you become one?

283
00:30:09,182 --> 00:30:10,517
A general?

284
00:30:21,152 --> 00:30:23,863
For a slave to rise to a general,

285
00:30:24,823 --> 00:30:26,616
that ain't easy.

286
00:30:30,578 --> 00:30:32,914
The battlefield taught me

287
00:30:34,582 --> 00:30:37,001
that it was a mere dream.

288
00:30:40,380 --> 00:30:42,215
Just one screw-up

289
00:30:44,092 --> 00:30:45,844
can kill you on the spot.

290
00:30:48,513 --> 00:30:50,139
But you.

291
00:30:51,641 --> 00:30:54,018
You survived Hoken.

292
00:30:55,979 --> 00:30:57,480
That's because

293
00:30:59,274 --> 00:31:02,026
we all protected you with our lives.

294
00:31:04,863 --> 00:31:08,575
We did so without any given orders.

295
00:31:11,619 --> 00:31:13,663
That's something.

296
00:31:15,123 --> 00:31:17,458
We'd never do that for anyone.

297
00:31:18,793 --> 00:31:20,295
That's how I know.

298
00:31:23,256 --> 00:31:24,465
Shin.

299
00:31:26,342 --> 00:31:29,137
You will truly become a general.

300
00:31:30,471 --> 00:31:32,265
Hey, are you okay?

301
00:31:33,433 --> 00:31:34,767
Listen.

302
00:31:37,896 --> 00:31:40,440
I'm glad you're my friend.

303
00:31:43,026 --> 00:31:45,111
Stop kidding, Bito.

304
00:31:45,194 --> 00:31:46,154
Shin.

305
00:31:48,781 --> 00:31:49,824
We all…

306
00:31:52,744 --> 00:31:55,413
We wanted to keep on dreaming with you.

307
00:31:57,040 --> 00:31:58,708
That's all we hoped for.

308
00:32:02,295 --> 00:32:04,130
Keep it up.

309
00:32:04,881 --> 00:32:06,007
For us all.

310
00:32:09,218 --> 00:32:12,388
Take our hopes with you.

311
00:32:14,557 --> 00:32:19,354
And rise to the top,
to be the greatest general on Earth.

312
00:32:21,898 --> 00:32:23,775
Hey, Bito.

313
00:32:23,858 --> 00:32:25,777
You can do it.

314
00:32:28,446 --> 00:32:29,405
Shin.

315
00:32:35,161 --> 00:32:36,245
Bito?

316
00:32:39,874 --> 00:32:40,959
Bito!

317
00:32:44,587 --> 00:32:45,421
Hey!

318
00:32:46,798 --> 00:32:50,051
Bito! Don't you die on me!

319
00:32:51,135 --> 00:32:52,303
Bito!

320
00:32:53,513 --> 00:32:55,306
Hey, Bito!

321
00:32:55,807 --> 00:32:57,266
Just kidding.

322
00:33:02,397 --> 00:33:04,649
Cut the crap, moron!

323
00:33:05,441 --> 00:33:06,526
Sorry.

324
00:33:09,278 --> 00:33:10,738
Get some sleep.

325
00:33:11,698 --> 00:33:16,285
I've talked too much. So tired.

326
00:33:19,122 --> 00:33:19,998
Right.

327
00:33:29,132 --> 00:33:30,258
Yuri…

328
00:33:59,996 --> 00:34:01,497
What's the matter, Yuri?

329
00:34:03,458 --> 00:34:04,417
Just now.

330
00:34:06,753 --> 00:34:08,379
I heard Bito say,

331
00:34:09,881 --> 00:34:11,257
"Forgive me."

332
00:35:08,773 --> 00:35:09,690
Bito.

333
00:35:17,448 --> 00:35:18,282
Bito?

334
00:35:22,453 --> 00:35:23,371
Wake up.

335
00:35:32,922 --> 00:35:33,881
Bito.

336
00:35:38,177 --> 00:35:39,053
Hey.

337
00:35:41,305 --> 00:35:43,516
I won't fall for it this time.

338
00:35:45,810 --> 00:35:46,727
Hey!

339
00:35:49,021 --> 00:35:50,773
Cut the crap!

340
00:35:52,900 --> 00:35:54,360
Wake up.

341
00:35:58,197 --> 00:35:59,949
Open your eyes.

342
00:36:03,536 --> 00:36:04,620
Bito.

343
00:36:09,542 --> 00:36:11,210
Stop kidding!

344
00:36:13,004 --> 00:36:14,547
You bastard.

345
00:36:19,427 --> 00:36:20,928
You bastard…

346
00:36:45,203 --> 00:36:46,787
Squad Leader Hairo!

347
00:36:47,663 --> 00:36:50,833
Squad Leader Ryusen
and Vice Commander Kyokai.

348
00:36:51,500 --> 00:36:52,793
You made it!

349
00:36:52,877 --> 00:36:56,005
-You're all okay.
-Squad Leader Ryusen.

350
00:36:56,088 --> 00:36:59,008
Thank goodness you're okay!

351
00:37:02,178 --> 00:37:03,429
Leader Ryusen!

352
00:37:03,512 --> 00:37:05,139
Everyone!

353
00:37:05,223 --> 00:37:07,808
-All of you!
-Kyokai!

354
00:37:07,892 --> 00:37:09,769
-Bihei.
-You've made it.

355
00:37:09,852 --> 00:37:10,811
What a relief.

356
00:37:12,313 --> 00:37:13,272
Bihei?

357
00:37:13,856 --> 00:37:16,234
Why are you with Bihei?

358
00:37:16,317 --> 00:37:18,694
Where are Shin and Bito?

359
00:37:20,529 --> 00:37:22,990
Bihei became a decoy.

360
00:37:23,741 --> 00:37:27,495
We were following Shin
when we met Bihei all worn out.

361
00:37:28,037 --> 00:37:29,914
Then our enemy caught up.

362
00:37:30,414 --> 00:37:33,125
But Vice Commander Kyokai guarded us.

363
00:37:35,002 --> 00:37:38,256
-Put me down. I'm okay.
-Right.

364
00:37:41,384 --> 00:37:45,096
Then the only one with Shin is Bito.

365
00:37:46,973 --> 00:37:48,140
Bito will do fine.

366
00:37:49,183 --> 00:37:50,142
Bihei.

367
00:37:50,226 --> 00:37:52,228
Count on him.

368
00:37:53,437 --> 00:37:55,356
He's hurt and can't move.

369
00:37:56,607 --> 00:38:00,152
Send a search team.
I have an idea where they are.

370
00:38:00,236 --> 00:38:03,531
I'll lead the way. Please!

371
00:38:04,031 --> 00:38:05,241
Let's go.

372
00:38:05,783 --> 00:38:09,453
No need for that.
Our Commander has returned.

373
00:38:18,921 --> 00:38:20,006
Shin!

374
00:38:20,089 --> 00:38:21,424
You're alive!

375
00:38:21,507 --> 00:38:22,466
Commander Shin!

376
00:38:22,550 --> 00:38:25,428
-Commander!
-Shin! Bito!

377
00:38:27,847 --> 00:38:29,056
Are you okay?

378
00:38:32,018 --> 00:38:35,229
You've made it back. Shin.

379
00:38:42,445 --> 00:38:43,446
Bihei.

380
00:38:45,531 --> 00:38:46,574
I'm sorry.

381
00:38:53,122 --> 00:38:54,123
Bito…

382
00:39:19,565 --> 00:39:20,649
Stop crying.

383
00:39:22,985 --> 00:39:24,862
No need to be sorry.

384
00:39:27,323 --> 00:39:28,991
Bito saw it through.

385
00:39:31,410 --> 00:39:33,454
He finished his duty.

386
00:39:36,248 --> 00:39:38,501
No tears or apologies.

387
00:39:42,046 --> 00:39:43,297
Let's smile,

388
00:39:46,342 --> 00:39:47,843
and praise him.

389
00:39:52,848 --> 00:39:54,850
You really did great.

390
00:39:55,976 --> 00:39:56,852
Bito.

391
00:40:45,776 --> 00:40:46,986
Hoken.

392
00:40:48,821 --> 00:40:50,656
What is he anyway?

393
00:40:52,324 --> 00:40:53,868
Isn't he human?

394
00:40:54,410 --> 00:40:56,036
Of course he is.

395
00:40:59,623 --> 00:41:02,710
Then how can he be so powerful?

396
00:41:05,254 --> 00:41:06,630
That man,

397
00:41:07,631 --> 00:41:10,593
seeks to master the martial path.

398
00:41:12,511 --> 00:41:13,888
His power,

399
00:41:14,555 --> 00:41:18,476
is the result of unbelievably
hard and endless training.

400
00:41:22,521 --> 00:41:24,648
<i>The move he used on you.</i>

401
00:41:25,524 --> 00:41:30,946
<i>We, Shiyu use it</i>
<i>to destroy our enemy from within.</i>

402
00:41:38,954 --> 00:41:42,500
<i>You're lucky to have survived that.</i>

403
00:41:53,844 --> 00:41:55,763
I'll defeat Hoken.

404
00:41:56,847 --> 00:42:00,768
I have to, as long as
he's the enemy's commander-in-chief.

405
00:42:10,110 --> 00:42:11,278
Bito.

406
00:42:15,783 --> 00:42:17,284
He was a good soul.

407
00:42:23,666 --> 00:42:24,542
Yeah.

408
00:42:27,127 --> 00:42:29,171
There's our flag!

409
00:42:39,473 --> 00:42:41,892
Mobu and Kanoh have set off.

410
00:42:56,407 --> 00:42:59,827
Your men have been
reduced to half over night.

411
00:43:00,327 --> 00:43:01,954
Hishin Unit.

412
00:43:06,041 --> 00:43:07,543
Having a rough time?

413
00:43:08,335 --> 00:43:09,878
Shin, my boy.

414
00:43:14,258 --> 00:43:16,427
I'm trying not to look back.

415
00:43:17,553 --> 00:43:19,054
Otherwise,

416
00:43:19,555 --> 00:43:23,350
I'll break down and stop completely.

417
00:43:24,893 --> 00:43:28,606
But my dead comrades wouldn't want that.

418
00:43:29,815 --> 00:43:30,941
No way.

419
00:43:33,235 --> 00:43:38,699
So, all I'm thinking about now
is how to fight with 36 of us.

420
00:43:39,533 --> 00:43:41,076
That's all.

421
00:43:48,876 --> 00:43:51,378
I was going to encourage him.

422
00:43:51,879 --> 00:43:55,966
-But there seems to be no need, Toh.
-My Lord.

423
00:43:57,760 --> 00:43:59,470
What a spoilsport.

424
00:44:03,349 --> 00:44:07,061
I like your attitude, Shin, my boy.

425
00:44:09,104 --> 00:44:13,067
The path of a general,
is the path of sacrifice.

426
00:44:14,902 --> 00:44:17,237
The more you overcome,

427
00:44:17,321 --> 00:44:22,534
the stronger you and your unit will grow.

428
00:44:27,414 --> 00:44:30,209
You have lived up to the name,
Hishin Unit.

429
00:44:46,266 --> 00:44:48,227
Let us set off.

430
00:44:49,103 --> 00:44:51,772
Our battle awaits.

431
00:45:22,386 --> 00:45:25,264
Glad to see you safe and sound.

432
00:45:26,265 --> 00:45:28,934
I thought Ohki appeared.

433
00:45:29,518 --> 00:45:33,981
As long as you are safe,
nothing interferes with our plan.

434
00:45:34,606 --> 00:45:39,194
However next time,
please let me know in advance.

435
00:45:39,278 --> 00:45:43,866
Otherwise, everything could be ruined.

436
00:45:43,949 --> 00:45:45,284
I know.

437
00:45:46,034 --> 00:45:47,953
Enemy attack!

438
00:45:48,454 --> 00:45:50,372
-Who is it?
-It's Mobu.

439
00:45:51,373 --> 00:45:53,750
-All armies, fall back.
-Yes, sir.

440
00:45:53,834 --> 00:45:55,335
The signal fire!

441
00:45:55,419 --> 00:45:57,379
We're ready for you, Ohki.

442
00:46:06,096 --> 00:46:07,431
Mobu's coming!

443
00:46:08,974 --> 00:46:13,270
Rear garrisons,
brace against enemy attack!

444
00:46:34,291 --> 00:46:35,834
A signal fire.

445
00:46:36,376 --> 00:46:38,712
The battle has begun.

446
00:46:39,213 --> 00:46:41,381
Mountain battles are hard.

447
00:46:41,882 --> 00:46:45,385
That signal fire is the only way
to communicate.

448
00:46:45,886 --> 00:46:49,306
There are other ways of communication
between allies.

449
00:46:49,806 --> 00:46:51,600
Like what, Lord Riboku?

450
00:46:52,100 --> 00:46:53,268
The flag.

451
00:46:54,144 --> 00:46:54,978
Look.

452
00:46:55,854 --> 00:46:58,732
Qin's headquarters flag has changed.

453
00:47:01,568 --> 00:47:06,532
One can send detailed information
by combining colors and positions.

454
00:47:08,116 --> 00:47:09,535
However,

455
00:47:10,494 --> 00:47:14,414
the flag's sighting is restricted.

456
00:47:29,471 --> 00:47:34,142
We could go farther.
But we'll lose sight of the flag.

457
00:47:34,810 --> 00:47:36,937
Cannot disobey our Lord.

458
00:47:52,536 --> 00:47:53,620
Hoken!

459
00:48:08,385 --> 00:48:10,804
Mobu, don't go any farther!

460
00:48:11,305 --> 00:48:13,640
General Ohki's orders.

461
00:48:14,308 --> 00:48:16,685
Our chance to behead Hoken!

462
00:48:17,436 --> 00:48:19,563
Let's go!

463
00:48:32,784 --> 00:48:38,665
QIN STATE, KING'S CAPITAL, XIANYANG

464
00:48:46,048 --> 00:48:47,257
Your Majesty.

465
00:48:47,883 --> 00:48:49,134
We have a visitor.

466
00:49:01,521 --> 00:49:05,609
It's been a long time.
To what do I owe the honor?

467
00:49:06,610 --> 00:49:08,028
Yotanwa.

468
00:49:09,363 --> 00:49:13,450
You look well. Eisei, the King of Qin.

469
00:49:15,160 --> 00:49:17,621
I'm aware of your situation.

470
00:49:18,121 --> 00:49:23,335
But I have come with urgent news
concerning the war you're engaged in.

471
00:49:38,016 --> 00:49:39,434
I see.

472
00:49:39,935 --> 00:49:43,063
So, you're playing strategist
with those men.

473
00:49:43,146 --> 00:49:46,566
I'm not playing.
I'm gonna be a real strategist.

474
00:49:49,111 --> 00:49:52,322
-Bad idea.
-How so?

475
00:49:53,532 --> 00:49:56,827
-I'm smarter than you think.
-That's not it.

476
00:49:58,245 --> 00:50:00,497
You don't get it, do you?

477
00:50:01,915 --> 00:50:02,958
Get what?

478
00:50:04,876 --> 00:50:06,378
The nature of a strategist.

479
00:50:08,296 --> 00:50:13,510
Being a strategist is more painful than
the soldiers bleeding at the front line.

480
00:50:14,720 --> 00:50:15,846
What's more,

481
00:50:18,056 --> 00:50:19,641
they're ruthless.

482
00:51:25,624 --> 00:51:27,334
Shut them up.

483
00:51:31,671 --> 00:51:32,839
It's not him.

484
00:51:34,257 --> 00:51:36,092
He's a decoy.

485
00:51:37,552 --> 00:51:38,804
What?

486
00:52:25,016 --> 00:52:30,272
If we go any farther,
we'll lose sight of our headquarters too.

487
00:52:30,355 --> 00:52:35,485
Which means we will lose sight
of this vast battlefield.

488
00:52:36,319 --> 00:52:38,238
It can't be helped.

489
00:52:38,822 --> 00:52:43,493
If we do nothing,
Mobu's life will end here.

490
00:52:47,581 --> 00:52:50,292
General Mobu? Why?

491
00:52:51,501 --> 00:52:54,963
A year since we put down
your brother's rebellion,

492
00:52:55,463 --> 00:52:58,341
we delved into battle
back in the mountains.

493
00:52:58,842 --> 00:53:02,554
As a result, our tribe have gained power

494
00:53:02,637 --> 00:53:06,933
and our land has spread
to the northern nomad's.

495
00:53:08,810 --> 00:53:09,853
The Huns.

496
00:53:09,936 --> 00:53:11,062
That's right.

497
00:53:12,022 --> 00:53:16,067
Their combat power, tactics,
the size of their armies.

498
00:53:16,151 --> 00:53:19,070
The Huns are exceptional in every way.

499
00:53:19,154 --> 00:53:20,989
I'm well aware.

500
00:53:21,072 --> 00:53:27,037
That's why we built the Great Wall
by the borders of Qin, Zhao, and Yan.

501
00:53:30,665 --> 00:53:32,876
To conquer the Huns

502
00:53:33,585 --> 00:53:39,382
we set off to invade their land
with my 80,000 men.

503
00:53:40,926 --> 00:53:41,843
I see.

504
00:53:43,428 --> 00:53:47,557
And now, you have appeared
looking as composed as ever.

505
00:53:47,641 --> 00:53:52,103
Yotanwa, have you defeated the Huns?

506
00:53:54,189 --> 00:53:55,065
No.

507
00:53:56,608 --> 00:53:58,318
I could not.

508
00:54:00,111 --> 00:54:01,446
What do you mean?

509
00:54:04,115 --> 00:54:05,825
They weren't there.

510
00:54:08,286 --> 00:54:09,746
Weren't there?

511
00:54:12,374 --> 00:54:13,500
Eisei.

512
00:54:14,709 --> 00:54:17,337
Instead, there was a horrific sight.

513
00:54:31,601 --> 00:54:35,647
<i>The dead bodies of over 100,000 Huns.</i>

514
00:54:50,787 --> 00:54:52,914
100,000 bodies?

515
00:54:53,873 --> 00:54:58,211
Who could have done it
before your Mountain tribes arrived?

516
00:54:58,837 --> 00:55:00,422
Who in god's name?

517
00:55:05,260 --> 00:55:07,679
The one who killed them,

518
00:55:08,805 --> 00:55:09,973
is in the Zhao Army.

519
00:55:10,056 --> 00:55:12,851
What? The Zhao Army?

520
00:55:13,435 --> 00:55:16,104
It was close to the Zhao border.

521
00:55:16,187 --> 00:55:21,901
The northern garrisons of Zhao
got into battle with the Huns,

522
00:55:21,985 --> 00:55:24,070
and wiped them out.

523
00:55:27,657 --> 00:55:29,325
That's impossible.

524
00:55:29,826 --> 00:55:34,706
If the Zhao Army was in a war
involving 100,000 of their men,

525
00:55:34,789 --> 00:55:39,085
our spy would have surely informed us
in Xianyang.

526
00:55:39,169 --> 00:55:40,378
Of course.

527
00:55:41,463 --> 00:55:45,425
But as you can see,
you were clearly not informed.

528
00:55:48,720 --> 00:55:51,639
Don't you find that alarming?

529
00:55:53,058 --> 00:55:54,100
Eisei?

530
00:55:57,979 --> 00:56:00,607
Why haven't you been informed?

531
00:56:03,985 --> 00:56:08,031
Zhao is blocking information
in the northern region.

532
00:56:08,114 --> 00:56:09,449
Why would they?

533
00:56:11,367 --> 00:56:16,539
To hide someone powerful
who is capable of defeating the Huns.

534
00:56:17,791 --> 00:56:19,167
What for?

535
00:56:20,085 --> 00:56:21,377
To hide…

536
00:56:26,466 --> 00:56:28,510
I see now.

537
00:56:30,136 --> 00:56:31,054
Do you?

538
00:56:32,555 --> 00:56:33,389
Your Majesty?

539
00:56:33,473 --> 00:56:35,558
Zhao is scheming

540
00:56:35,642 --> 00:56:39,854
to add the hidden army
to the ones in battle now.

541
00:56:40,855 --> 00:56:47,445
If by chance both Qin and Zhao forces
are neck and neck,

542
00:56:49,280 --> 00:56:54,410
this battle will end
with the appearance of this unseen army.

543
00:56:54,994 --> 00:56:58,331
That's absurd!

544
00:56:58,915 --> 00:57:01,084
This is only a hunch.

545
00:57:01,584 --> 00:57:03,962
But if it's true,

546
00:57:04,045 --> 00:57:07,590
it must be the work
of a merciless strategist.

547
00:57:08,883 --> 00:57:13,930
100,000 Huns were wiped out completely
by this strategist.

548
00:57:16,141 --> 00:57:18,935
Who was leading that army?

549
00:57:19,978 --> 00:57:23,940
The name I got from a surviving Hun was,

550
00:57:26,192 --> 00:57:27,277
Riboku!

551
00:57:35,785 --> 00:57:36,870
What?

552
00:57:37,370 --> 00:57:38,621
They're here.

553
00:57:48,631 --> 00:57:49,716
The Zhao Army?

554
00:57:50,216 --> 00:57:51,718
Why are they here?

555
00:57:54,345 --> 00:57:57,182
We've come for you, Lord Riboku.

556
00:57:58,224 --> 00:58:02,187
<i>Choso has cornered their central army</i>
<i>and is engaged in battle.</i>

557
00:58:12,572 --> 00:58:16,618
<i>Their main army</i>
<i>should be destroyed soon enough.</i>

558
00:58:21,539 --> 00:58:23,124
Good job.

559
00:58:28,129 --> 00:58:29,964
What is this?

560
00:58:33,134 --> 00:58:35,303
You tricked us, Kaine.

561
00:58:36,387 --> 00:58:38,681
Thought you were nice.

562
00:58:41,684 --> 00:58:44,103
This isn't a kid's fight.

563
00:58:44,812 --> 00:58:46,147
This is war.

564
00:58:47,774 --> 00:58:50,401
Are you going to kill us?

565
00:58:51,361 --> 00:58:52,570
Don't worry.

566
00:58:52,654 --> 00:58:55,198
Lord Riboku doesn't kill noncombatants.

567
00:58:56,157 --> 00:58:57,700
Go back to Qin.

568
00:59:01,204 --> 00:59:02,914
So long, Karyoten.

569
00:59:03,790 --> 00:59:06,584
If you really become a strategist,

570
00:59:07,335 --> 00:59:09,379
we may cross paths again.

571
00:59:11,756 --> 00:59:12,966
As enemies.

572
00:59:18,137 --> 00:59:19,347
Wait!

573
00:59:20,390 --> 00:59:24,102
Please tell me. Who is Riboku?

574
00:59:26,020 --> 00:59:28,690
Heard of Zhao's Three Great Heavens?

575
00:59:29,857 --> 00:59:31,276
Of course.

576
00:59:34,112 --> 00:59:35,238
That's him.

577
00:59:39,450 --> 00:59:44,622
That man is one of
the new Three Great Heavens?

578
00:59:50,336 --> 00:59:51,838
RI

579
00:59:51,921 --> 00:59:56,259
As of now, Riboku's men will join Choso's!

580
00:59:56,342 --> 00:59:59,429
Central army, to the north!

581
01:00:01,139 --> 01:00:03,891
Left army, to the north!

582
01:00:03,975 --> 01:00:06,686
Right army, to the north!

583
01:00:07,395 --> 01:00:10,023
All armies, forward!

584
01:00:26,748 --> 01:00:29,375
Ohki's men are behind us!

585
01:00:35,214 --> 01:00:36,507
This can't be.

586
01:00:38,343 --> 01:00:40,720
Ohki…

587
01:00:41,763 --> 01:00:44,140
Sacrificed his army for us.

588
01:01:01,115 --> 01:01:03,201
ZHAO

589
01:01:04,577 --> 01:01:06,537
There you are, Ohki.

590
01:01:08,748 --> 01:01:09,999
Toh.

591
01:01:10,500 --> 01:01:12,418
Let's go with our plan.

592
01:01:12,960 --> 01:01:15,004
My Lord, our plan.

593
01:01:15,505 --> 01:01:17,965
That's right, our plan.

594
01:01:18,549 --> 01:01:19,676
My Lord.

595
01:01:21,469 --> 01:01:22,887
What is it?

596
01:01:49,414 --> 01:01:51,958
He's going for Lord Choso!

597
01:01:52,542 --> 01:01:54,335
Block the way!

598
01:02:31,456 --> 01:02:32,957
Wow…

599
01:02:34,375 --> 01:02:37,336
Now for the Hishin Unit.

600
01:02:37,837 --> 01:02:40,006
I have a big task for you.

601
01:02:44,761 --> 01:02:45,845
First,

602
01:02:47,221 --> 01:02:51,726
run straight towards Mobu's army,
if you please.

603
01:02:59,400 --> 01:03:00,526
Then what?

604
01:03:01,569 --> 01:03:02,987
That's all.

605
01:03:03,863 --> 01:03:04,697
Huh?

606
01:03:14,999 --> 01:03:17,335
-The second wave is coming.
-Which way?

607
01:03:17,418 --> 01:03:19,712
Running towards Mobu's army.

608
01:03:29,055 --> 01:03:31,015
Confront their infantry!

609
01:03:37,355 --> 01:03:38,523
Ohki.

610
01:03:39,190 --> 01:03:42,193
How do you expect to succeed?

611
01:03:43,402 --> 01:03:46,072
Second troops, charge!

612
01:03:46,823 --> 01:03:49,659
First unit, destroy their left infantry.

613
01:03:49,742 --> 01:03:53,371
Second unit, destroy their right cavalry.

614
01:03:54,664 --> 01:03:57,041
Reinforcements are here!

615
01:03:58,835 --> 01:04:00,044
It's hopeless.

616
01:04:00,127 --> 01:04:01,838
This plan is crazy!

617
01:04:01,921 --> 01:04:04,382
No, General Ohki was right.

618
01:04:04,465 --> 01:04:05,466
Huh?

619
01:04:05,550 --> 01:04:07,885
They're breaking up.

620
01:04:08,678 --> 01:04:10,346
I see a gap.

621
01:04:16,686 --> 01:04:18,688
The cavalry is coming!

622
01:04:28,072 --> 01:04:31,701
We'll have your headquarters
in no time, Choso.

623
01:04:42,545 --> 01:04:45,172
Wow, no stopping him.

624
01:04:51,679 --> 01:04:54,599
-There's General Ohki.
-General Ohki.

625
01:05:00,062 --> 01:05:01,564
Ohki…

626
01:05:21,876 --> 01:05:25,713
All left armies, charge!
Follow General Ohki!

627
01:05:31,802 --> 01:05:35,139
Leave the cavalry. Keep the peasants away.

628
01:05:35,222 --> 01:05:36,724
Stop them!

629
01:05:40,686 --> 01:05:42,521
To the right cavalry!

630
01:05:42,605 --> 01:05:45,483
Attack their headquarters.

631
01:05:45,566 --> 01:05:47,818
Let's get Choso's head!

632
01:05:57,328 --> 01:05:58,329
Lord Choso.

633
01:05:58,412 --> 01:06:02,667
Their right army is coming.
This is a full-scale attack.

634
01:06:03,167 --> 01:06:07,296
But that's absurd.
It's too soon for a big gamble.

635
01:06:07,380 --> 01:06:09,340
Ohki must be insane.

636
01:06:09,423 --> 01:06:10,967
Why the hurry?

637
01:06:12,426 --> 01:06:14,971
Has he seen through us?

638
01:06:15,638 --> 01:06:17,306
Our scheme?

639
01:06:46,752 --> 01:06:49,672
Raise the Great Heavens' flag!

640
01:06:51,132 --> 01:06:53,634
THE GREAT HEAVENS

641
01:06:53,718 --> 01:06:57,388
THE GREAT HEAVENS

642
01:07:10,568 --> 01:07:11,694
What is it?

643
01:07:17,283 --> 01:07:18,784
The Great Heavens' flag.

644
01:07:40,222 --> 01:07:42,058
It's been nine years.

645
01:07:43,309 --> 01:07:46,771
Well, well. We finally meet again.

646
01:07:47,813 --> 01:07:49,565
Hoken.

647
01:07:49,648 --> 01:07:52,109
Get out of my way!

648
01:07:56,489 --> 01:07:57,656
Hoken.

649
01:08:02,620 --> 01:08:04,497
I'm surprised.

650
01:08:05,122 --> 01:08:08,250
I thought you were dead.

651
01:08:08,334 --> 01:08:13,047
You suddenly appear as
the commander-in-chief of 100,000 men.

652
01:08:14,381 --> 01:08:16,383
You amuse me.

653
01:08:17,968 --> 01:08:20,429
I will take you down

654
01:08:21,514 --> 01:08:25,309
and prove to the Heavens
that I am the Bushin.

655
01:08:29,438 --> 01:08:32,191
Glad to see you haven't changed.

656
01:08:36,403 --> 01:08:38,489
<i>I've always wondered</i>

657
01:08:41,158 --> 01:08:43,285
about Ohki and Hoken.

658
01:08:43,786 --> 01:08:47,748
And one of the Six Great Generals, Kyo.

659
01:08:50,626 --> 01:08:54,380
What kind of general was Kyo?

660
01:08:57,258 --> 01:09:01,720
I'm afraid much about Kyo remains unknown.

661
01:09:02,221 --> 01:09:03,639
Why?

662
01:09:04,682 --> 01:09:07,768
King Sho forbade any talks about it.

663
01:09:09,937 --> 01:09:11,313
King Sho?

664
01:09:12,648 --> 01:09:14,150
Forgive me.

665
01:09:14,650 --> 01:09:19,613
Now that Ohki and Hoken are in conflict,
I should have informed you earlier.

666
01:09:20,656 --> 01:09:22,366
Who was General Kyo?

667
01:09:28,038 --> 01:09:32,960
The secret concerning Kyo
was extremely complicated.

668
01:09:34,044 --> 01:09:36,881
But most importantly

669
01:09:38,090 --> 01:09:40,176
to Ohki,

670
01:09:41,135 --> 01:09:44,555
Kyo was someone very special.

671
01:09:54,440 --> 01:09:57,067
<i>General Kyo,</i>

672
01:09:59,862 --> 01:10:01,280
<i>was a woman.</i>

673
01:10:06,785 --> 01:10:07,995
<i>And,</i>

674
01:10:10,372 --> 01:10:13,876
<i>she was to become Ohki's wife.</i>

675
01:10:37,650 --> 01:10:40,653
The first time I saw Kyo,

676
01:10:42,112 --> 01:10:46,075
was at a campsite
on my way to a battlefield.

677
01:10:48,410 --> 01:10:55,000
TERRITORY OF QIN STATE, CAMPSITE
21 YEARS AGO

678
01:11:13,352 --> 01:11:14,728
Who is that woman?

679
01:11:14,812 --> 01:11:16,146
Don't you know?

680
01:11:16,647 --> 01:11:21,652
She's Kyo, the much-talked-about
woman soldier and aide to General Ohki.

681
01:11:21,735 --> 01:11:23,112
Woman soldier?

682
01:11:23,195 --> 01:11:26,991
I heard she's the child of
Ohki's house servant.

683
01:11:27,491 --> 01:11:31,704
Since childhood,
she learned martial arts watching Ohki.

684
01:11:31,787 --> 01:11:33,622
She's a great warrior.

685
01:11:33,706 --> 01:11:37,584
Warrior my ass.
A woman like her can't fight.

686
01:11:40,921 --> 01:11:42,006
<i>However…</i>

687
01:11:45,009 --> 01:11:48,512
<i>After sharing the battlefields</i>
<i>in the Ohki army,</i>

688
01:11:49,388 --> 01:11:53,684
<i>I came to realize</i>
<i>she excelled in military skills.</i>

689
01:11:56,645 --> 01:11:59,606
<i>Both in combat and tactics,</i>

690
01:12:00,399 --> 01:12:01,984
<i>Kyo was indeed,</i>

691
01:12:02,860 --> 01:12:05,571
<i>a prodigy at warfare.</i>

692
01:12:10,367 --> 01:12:11,785
Then,

693
01:12:13,287 --> 01:12:18,334
the Battle of Nanan
that cost the lives of many occurred.

694
01:12:23,630 --> 01:12:26,675
<i>Our army ended up losing soldiers</i>

695
01:12:27,176 --> 01:12:29,887
<i>and several generals.</i>

696
01:12:30,929 --> 01:12:32,806
<i>And so came a day,</i>

697
01:12:33,557 --> 01:12:38,145
<i>when Ohki was appointed</i>
<i>commander-in-chief for the first time.</i>

698
01:12:49,156 --> 01:12:50,491
Shobunkun.

699
01:12:51,742 --> 01:12:55,996
You and your unit
will act in line with Kyo's unit.

700
01:12:56,580 --> 01:12:58,207
As a commander,

701
01:12:58,290 --> 01:13:02,086
I won't be able to move around so easily.

702
01:13:03,087 --> 01:13:05,923
Take good care of Kyo.

703
01:13:11,178 --> 01:13:14,848
You know she won't be needing any help.

704
01:13:15,349 --> 01:13:16,600
Kyo,

705
01:13:17,476 --> 01:13:19,895
is loved by the War God.

706
01:13:21,397 --> 01:13:23,941
Kyo is comfortable fighting,

707
01:13:24,441 --> 01:13:28,237
because she knows
you always have her back.

708
01:13:29,405 --> 01:13:31,156
She told me so.

709
01:13:31,657 --> 01:13:33,784
"Fighting is easy-peasy."

710
01:13:33,867 --> 01:13:37,704
"Thanks to old gramps and his hard work."

711
01:13:38,789 --> 01:13:40,916
That cocky girl.

712
01:13:42,459 --> 01:13:44,711
I agree with her.

713
01:13:45,462 --> 01:13:48,841
It'll be a relief to have you with Kyo.

714
01:13:51,260 --> 01:13:52,469
Shobunkun.

715
01:13:53,429 --> 01:13:57,391
Now that I am commander
in a tough situation,

716
01:13:57,474 --> 01:14:00,727
I may lose my life at any time.

717
01:14:04,606 --> 01:14:06,442
So I must tell you,

718
01:14:08,193 --> 01:14:11,530
and only you, about this secret.

719
01:14:15,159 --> 01:14:17,453
This is important.

720
01:14:24,460 --> 01:14:26,128
<i>Ohki told me,</i>

721
01:14:27,004 --> 01:14:30,007
<i>about the life of a court attendant.</i>

722
01:14:33,260 --> 01:14:35,053
<i>The woman,</i>

723
01:14:35,554 --> 01:14:39,516
<i>won King Sho's favor,</i>
<i>and gave birth to his child.</i>

724
01:14:40,434 --> 01:14:45,272
<i>She was from a low-class military family,</i>
<i>and had no allies.</i>

725
01:14:46,565 --> 01:14:50,444
<i>Her baby would be involved</i>
<i>in a war of succession,</i>

726
01:14:51,278 --> 01:14:55,908
<i>and she feared</i>
<i>that she would not be able to protect it.</i>

727
01:14:57,701 --> 01:14:59,119
<i>And so,</i>

728
01:14:59,786 --> 01:15:03,290
<i>she sent her baby to her father's comrade</i>

729
01:15:04,583 --> 01:15:06,919
<i>in order to save its life.</i>

730
01:15:12,007 --> 01:15:13,926
Please be well.

731
01:15:17,095 --> 01:15:18,096
Kyo.

732
01:15:20,766 --> 01:15:21,934
<i>No…</i>

733
01:15:24,686 --> 01:15:27,606
Kyo is the daughter of King Sho?

734
01:15:28,899 --> 01:15:29,775
That's right.

735
01:16:01,098 --> 01:16:04,309
You're lighter than I'd expected.

736
01:16:05,978 --> 01:16:10,232
<i>The one who took her in was Ohki's father.</i>

737
01:16:13,235 --> 01:16:15,112
With discretion

738
01:16:16,405 --> 01:16:19,366
she was raised as the child of a servant.

739
01:16:23,036 --> 01:16:24,496
Unbelievable.

740
01:16:26,623 --> 01:16:31,962
Ohki's words weren't enough
for me to believe in them.

741
01:16:33,046 --> 01:16:34,548
Until,

742
01:16:36,675 --> 01:16:42,347
there was an incident which made it clear
that King Sho and Kyo were related.

743
01:16:47,269 --> 01:16:52,399
King Sho visited Ohki's army
at the Battle of Nanan

744
01:16:54,401 --> 01:16:57,195
to commend his men.

745
01:17:07,748 --> 01:17:09,958
QIN

746
01:17:28,518 --> 01:17:30,312
Brilliant as ever.

747
01:17:31,396 --> 01:17:33,523
My treasured sword, Ohki.

748
01:17:36,693 --> 01:17:38,320
This Nanan region,

749
01:17:38,820 --> 01:17:42,949
had long been an impregnable place for us.

750
01:17:44,117 --> 01:17:47,120
You have lived up to my expectations.

751
01:17:48,205 --> 01:17:50,499
Undeserved words.

752
01:17:58,382 --> 01:18:01,385
By the way, Ohki.

753
01:18:02,886 --> 01:18:04,888
Where is that soldier?

754
01:18:05,972 --> 01:18:08,392
The one active on the battlefield.

755
01:18:09,851 --> 01:18:14,481
That woman soldier and aide of yours, Kyo.

756
01:18:16,483 --> 01:18:18,944
I hear her name frequently.

757
01:18:23,782 --> 01:18:24,866
Where is she?

758
01:18:28,870 --> 01:18:29,788
Kyo.

759
01:18:31,039 --> 01:18:31,998
Yes, Commander.

760
01:18:34,668 --> 01:18:37,629
<i>They knew nothing of the truth,</i>

761
01:18:39,005 --> 01:18:41,675
<i>as they met for the first time.</i>

762
01:18:49,558 --> 01:18:50,976
<i>However…</i>

763
01:18:53,186 --> 01:18:55,272
<i>At that moment</i>

764
01:18:57,399 --> 01:19:00,861
<i>they understood</i>
<i>they were father and daughter.</i>

765
01:19:10,454 --> 01:19:11,580
Kyo.

766
01:19:13,165 --> 01:19:14,833
How old are you?

767
01:19:18,211 --> 01:19:19,588
Sixteen, Your Majesty.

768
01:19:24,593 --> 01:19:25,761
I see.

769
01:19:29,806 --> 01:19:32,934
You've done very well, Kyo.

770
01:19:36,688 --> 01:19:38,315
As well as Ohki,

771
01:19:40,609 --> 01:19:42,903
you are my treasure.

772
01:20:14,017 --> 01:20:15,644
King Sho,

773
01:20:17,854 --> 01:20:22,317
could not acknowledge Kyo
as his daughter openly.

774
01:20:24,277 --> 01:20:28,448
If a baby was let out of the palace
without permission,

775
01:20:28,990 --> 01:20:31,326
he would set a bad example.

776
01:20:33,829 --> 01:20:36,289
Kyo understood that.

777
01:20:36,373 --> 01:20:40,836
Since then, she hid her face with a mask.

778
01:20:42,462 --> 01:20:44,756
<i>As for Kyo,</i>

779
01:20:45,966 --> 01:20:49,553
<i>it was forbidden to discuss her identity.</i>

780
01:20:56,101 --> 01:20:57,978
You're a woman.

781
01:20:58,812 --> 01:21:03,108
You still have the choice
of putting down the sword.

782
01:21:03,775 --> 01:21:05,110
I won't put it down.

783
01:21:06,903 --> 01:21:11,199
But what will you gain
through all this fighting?

784
01:21:12,659 --> 01:21:14,536
I'll be a great general.

785
01:21:16,037 --> 01:21:17,038
Huh?

786
01:21:23,378 --> 01:21:25,672
The reason I fight

787
01:21:26,464 --> 01:21:30,468
comes from a trivial childhood promise.

788
01:21:32,053 --> 01:21:33,930
A childhood promise?

789
01:21:36,474 --> 01:21:40,270
When I was a little girl,
I asked Lord Ohki.

790
01:21:41,813 --> 01:21:44,316
If I were to aim high like him,

791
01:21:45,108 --> 01:21:49,946
to become a great general
and conquer the 100th castle,

792
01:21:51,990 --> 01:21:54,367
would he make me his wife?

793
01:21:55,702 --> 01:21:59,039
-He said, "Okay."
-That's ridiculous.

794
01:21:59,122 --> 01:22:00,582
I know.

795
01:22:01,207 --> 01:22:03,627
It was just a silly promise.

796
01:22:05,045 --> 01:22:09,674
But at the time, I was dead serious.

797
01:22:11,259 --> 01:22:14,721
That's why I fought hard.

798
01:22:21,478 --> 01:22:25,815
My place is here.
I have lots of friends and comrades.

799
01:22:27,859 --> 01:22:28,985
Besides,

800
01:22:31,112 --> 01:22:33,323
I have my father watching.

801
01:22:41,247 --> 01:22:42,707
My mind is set.

802
01:23:09,609 --> 01:23:13,822
<i>Soon, Kyo was made general</i>
<i>with many accomplishments…</i>

803
01:23:13,905 --> 01:23:14,990
KYO

804
01:23:15,073 --> 01:23:18,660
<i>…and became one of the Six Great Generals.</i>

805
01:23:23,248 --> 01:23:27,585
KYO

806
01:23:37,470 --> 01:23:38,763
And then,

807
01:23:40,682 --> 01:23:43,059
the time had finally come.

808
01:24:11,087 --> 01:24:15,050
The pain inflicted on my body
will disappear in time.

809
01:24:19,137 --> 01:24:20,096
However,

810
01:24:21,097 --> 01:24:25,310
the pain inflicted on my soul
will never disappear.

811
01:24:27,187 --> 01:24:28,354
Ohki.

812
01:24:29,147 --> 01:24:31,483
It must be the same for you.

813
01:24:33,234 --> 01:24:35,111
Anger is power.

814
01:24:36,946 --> 01:24:38,323
Remember,

815
01:24:40,158 --> 01:24:43,119
how she died nine years ago.

816
01:24:52,545 --> 01:24:53,963
Lord Ohki.

817
01:24:54,631 --> 01:24:57,592
I heard you won another battle.

818
01:24:59,928 --> 01:25:00,929
Are you hurt?

819
01:25:09,813 --> 01:25:11,356
It's just a scratch.

820
01:25:21,991 --> 01:25:25,578
Lord Ohki, I can do that myself.

821
01:25:26,412 --> 01:25:28,206
Just a while back,

822
01:25:28,790 --> 01:25:31,626
I treated your wound every day.

823
01:25:31,709 --> 01:25:34,003
How long ago was that?

824
01:25:34,504 --> 01:25:37,215
I'm not a child any more.

825
01:25:39,843 --> 01:25:42,637
It's been a while, Kyo.

826
01:25:43,346 --> 01:25:49,352
As we're both great generals,
the wars have kept us busy.

827
01:25:50,228 --> 01:25:51,062
Indeed.

828
01:26:02,407 --> 01:26:04,617
What brings you here?

829
01:26:07,453 --> 01:26:12,250
I traveled all this way
just to see your face.

830
01:26:12,917 --> 01:26:13,751
What?

831
01:26:15,545 --> 01:26:17,088
I'm just joking.

832
01:26:18,006 --> 01:26:20,091
There's another war.

833
01:26:20,675 --> 01:26:22,260
Another?

834
01:26:22,343 --> 01:26:23,178
KYO

835
01:26:23,261 --> 01:26:28,099
In this next battle, you and I
will fight together as allied forces.

836
01:26:28,683 --> 01:26:30,393
Lord Ohki and I?

837
01:26:33,688 --> 01:26:38,943
I'll be your adjutant,
and you'll be my commander, Kyo.

838
01:26:44,073 --> 01:26:46,284
The time has come, Kyo.

839
01:26:50,121 --> 01:26:54,292
The next castle in Bayo
will be the 100th to conquer.

840
01:27:08,264 --> 01:27:10,558
He remembered.

841
01:27:12,227 --> 01:27:14,145
The numbers too.

842
01:28:10,285 --> 01:28:12,370
I remember, Hoken.

843
01:28:13,830 --> 01:28:15,915
No need to remind me.

844
01:28:18,584 --> 01:28:21,879
My anger has never subsided!

845
01:28:31,264 --> 01:28:32,724
<i>Bayo has been taken!</i>

846
01:28:33,224 --> 01:28:35,018
BAYO CASTLE

847
01:29:05,423 --> 01:29:06,716
Kyo.

848
01:29:30,198 --> 01:29:31,616
That's it.

849
01:29:35,745 --> 01:29:38,414
I have come to destroy you.

850
01:30:11,697 --> 01:30:13,783
Ready! Shoot!

851
01:32:32,380 --> 01:32:36,425
To a warrior like you
who thinks he has mastered the arts,

852
01:32:37,009 --> 01:32:39,220
it must make no sense.

853
01:32:40,930 --> 01:32:44,392
Being a general is not easy.

854
01:32:44,892 --> 01:32:47,520
I've toured countless battlefields.

855
01:32:47,603 --> 01:32:52,066
Lost tens of thousands of comrades
and buried hundreds of thousands of foes.

856
01:32:53,776 --> 01:32:57,446
Their hopes that faded
with the spark of life,

857
01:32:58,781 --> 01:33:02,618
all dwell deeply upon my shoulders.

858
01:33:05,371 --> 01:33:06,455
Needless to say,

859
01:33:08,624 --> 01:33:10,668
along with Kyo's hopes!

860
01:33:15,423 --> 01:33:18,009
Their right cavalry is coming!

861
01:33:18,092 --> 01:33:19,802
Our third line, broken through!

862
01:33:20,344 --> 01:33:22,596
Who is that man?

863
01:33:23,097 --> 01:33:24,307
Ohki.

864
01:33:25,141 --> 01:33:27,685
He had a monster up his sleeve.

865
01:33:28,269 --> 01:33:30,604
Please retreat.

866
01:33:34,358 --> 01:33:37,445
Get him! General Ohki!

867
01:33:43,200 --> 01:33:45,411
Bushin, Hoken.

868
01:33:46,871 --> 01:33:52,585
A Bushin will eliminate all his emotions
and become a monster of war.

869
01:33:53,961 --> 01:33:56,839
I never thought any man could beat him.

870
01:34:00,801 --> 01:34:05,181
How could Ohki be
so overwhelmingly powerful?

871
01:34:28,996 --> 01:34:30,873
In the afterlife…

872
01:34:38,672 --> 01:34:41,092
Have Kyo teach you why you lost!

873
01:34:43,052 --> 01:34:44,678
Go!

874
01:34:59,402 --> 01:35:00,528
What the hell…

875
01:35:39,483 --> 01:35:42,111
RI

876
01:36:15,895 --> 01:36:18,522
Raise the Great Heavens' flag!

877
01:36:22,526 --> 01:36:25,946
THE GREAT HEAVENS

878
01:36:34,538 --> 01:36:35,706
Another flag.

879
01:36:36,207 --> 01:36:38,417
Another Great Heavens?

880
01:36:38,501 --> 01:36:39,376
How many?

881
01:36:39,460 --> 01:36:42,421
No idea. They're all the Zhao Army.

882
01:36:46,175 --> 01:36:48,928
Lord Choso,
where did our allies come from?

883
01:36:49,011 --> 01:36:49,845
ZHAO

884
01:36:49,929 --> 01:36:51,597
I'll tell you later.

885
01:36:52,097 --> 01:36:53,974
What's important is

886
01:36:54,850 --> 01:36:58,270
that this battle is all ours.

887
01:36:58,354 --> 01:36:59,313
They're coming!

888
01:36:59,396 --> 01:37:02,191
Retreat and guard Lord Choso!

889
01:37:03,609 --> 01:37:04,985
Choso is escaping.

890
01:37:05,069 --> 01:37:06,654
-Let's get him.
-Yes, sir.

891
01:37:07,571 --> 01:37:09,323
THE GREAT HEAVENS

892
01:37:09,406 --> 01:37:14,370
Why go all this way
just to take down a single general?

893
01:37:15,287 --> 01:37:18,582
We didn't go this far for the Huns.

894
01:37:20,376 --> 01:37:25,506
We even manipulated information
so Ohki would know Hoken was commander.

895
01:37:26,549 --> 01:37:28,175
Was that necessary?

896
01:37:29,802 --> 01:37:32,096
It's Ohki we're dealing with.

897
01:37:32,763 --> 01:37:36,100
We can never be too careful.

898
01:37:36,976 --> 01:37:39,603
We must keep our guards up.

899
01:37:42,481 --> 01:37:44,608
Riboku's army first line!

900
01:37:44,692 --> 01:37:46,860
Charge!

901
01:37:51,949 --> 01:37:53,993
Rear units, ready.

902
01:37:54,660 --> 01:37:55,995
Guard General Ohki!

903
01:38:19,893 --> 01:38:21,145
General Ohki!

904
01:38:29,320 --> 01:38:33,907
They're much earlier than I'd expected.

905
01:38:35,159 --> 01:38:36,910
Impressive!

906
01:38:40,331 --> 01:38:43,792
Twenty years since I last
had this feeling.

907
01:38:46,003 --> 01:38:47,421
It's been a while.

908
01:38:50,090 --> 01:38:51,925
Gives me the chills!

909
01:38:54,219 --> 01:38:56,889
Fall back as we search for a gap.

910
01:38:56,972 --> 01:39:00,601
First line, guard.
Second line, lead the infantry.

911
01:39:00,684 --> 01:39:04,730
Third and fourth,
secure a base behind Choso's left wing.

912
01:39:04,813 --> 01:39:06,106
Yes sir!

913
01:39:06,190 --> 01:39:07,524
Commander Shin!

914
01:39:07,608 --> 01:39:10,861
We haven't given up yet. Let's join them!

915
01:39:10,944 --> 01:39:11,779
Yes!

916
01:39:12,488 --> 01:39:14,657
Where do you think you're going?

917
01:39:24,249 --> 01:39:26,585
We are not yet through.

918
01:39:39,973 --> 01:39:41,642
Guard General Ohki!

919
01:39:41,725 --> 01:39:43,602
Pull Hoken away!

920
01:39:49,608 --> 01:39:51,652
Protect General Hoken!

921
01:40:00,661 --> 01:40:03,497
The Monstrous Bird has fallen.

922
01:40:04,581 --> 01:40:07,793
In all the states of present China

923
01:40:07,876 --> 01:40:12,798
there is no other general
that is as hated and feared as Ohki.

924
01:40:15,342 --> 01:40:18,137
But at the same time, it proves

925
01:40:18,721 --> 01:40:24,393
he will become a historical hero
and that he is well acknowledged.

926
01:40:26,186 --> 01:40:28,021
That Ohki,

927
01:40:28,105 --> 01:40:30,733
will be defeated today.

928
01:40:32,151 --> 01:40:36,488
Ohki who is said to be the strongest
of the Six Great Generals.

929
01:40:39,283 --> 01:40:41,326
Do you know why, Kaine?

930
01:40:43,912 --> 01:40:47,875
It's because Lord Riboku here,

931
01:40:47,958 --> 01:40:51,128
is an even bigger monster than Ohki.

932
01:40:55,549 --> 01:40:59,845
A new era has
finally come upon Lord Riboku.

933
01:41:04,475 --> 01:41:07,936
Now, I will go fulfil my duty.

934
01:41:10,063 --> 01:41:11,148
Where to?

935
01:41:12,691 --> 01:41:14,151
To mark a new era

936
01:41:14,234 --> 01:41:18,781
we cannot let General Hoken perish
at this moment.

937
01:41:19,406 --> 01:41:23,827
On this observed stage
I, Gika, will leave a mark.

938
01:41:24,411 --> 01:41:29,041
Though I may ruin their sacred battle.

939
01:41:30,250 --> 01:41:31,585
Much appreciated.

940
01:41:57,611 --> 01:41:58,821
What's wrong?

941
01:42:01,073 --> 01:42:02,991
Your thrust is quivering.

942
01:42:11,792 --> 01:42:14,378
-He's too fast.
-He'll catch up!

943
01:42:19,967 --> 01:42:21,885
The time has finally come.

944
01:42:22,386 --> 01:42:26,473
Ohki will die in the battle I serve
as deputy general.

945
01:42:28,183 --> 01:42:30,394
I cannot help but laugh.

946
01:42:31,728 --> 01:42:33,814
My only regret is,

947
01:42:35,148 --> 01:42:37,693
I won't be able to witness it.

948
01:42:43,156 --> 01:42:45,993
We have Choso's head!

949
01:42:46,076 --> 01:42:48,412
Back to our Lord!

950
01:43:14,980 --> 01:43:16,356
General Ohki!

951
01:43:17,149 --> 01:43:18,483
Take down Ohki!

952
01:43:40,422 --> 01:43:42,299
Honestly.

953
01:43:42,799 --> 01:43:48,055
Dealing with both a strategist
and a warrior is quite a task.

954
01:43:50,349 --> 01:43:52,809
Especially the strategist.

955
01:43:53,310 --> 01:43:56,813
He had me racking my brain.

956
01:44:01,234 --> 01:44:04,279
Although I must confess,

957
01:44:05,948 --> 01:44:08,909
I'm completely out of ideas.

958
01:44:16,083 --> 01:44:17,751
Still…

959
01:44:20,504 --> 01:44:23,131
If we have no plan,

960
01:44:23,215 --> 01:44:25,384
strength we have!

961
01:44:46,113 --> 01:44:49,074
Hishin Unit, follow him!

962
01:44:53,954 --> 01:44:56,873
Fight for your dead comrades!

963
01:45:12,764 --> 01:45:14,266
Who are they?

964
01:45:16,143 --> 01:45:17,978
We're the Hishin Unit!

965
01:45:29,823 --> 01:45:33,577
To all our soldiers who can hear me.

966
01:45:34,411 --> 01:45:36,830
We are outnumbered ten times over.

967
01:45:38,165 --> 01:45:42,502
Therefore, I order you
to take down ten men each.

968
01:45:43,253 --> 01:45:47,883
Until you slay ten of the enemy,
I will not allow you to fall!

969
01:45:49,342 --> 01:45:50,469
Everyone.

970
01:45:51,636 --> 01:45:54,598
Fight as if you were beasts!

971
01:45:56,099 --> 01:45:57,476
Now,

972
01:46:00,437 --> 01:46:03,440
is the time to show our true worth.

973
01:46:04,524 --> 01:46:09,154
Use our strength
to open a path in this deathtrap!

974
01:46:13,700 --> 01:46:15,494
For I, Ohki,

975
01:46:18,663 --> 01:46:21,374
shall be right behind you all!

976
01:46:55,659 --> 01:46:57,953
A contest of strength.

977
01:47:00,914 --> 01:47:02,541
Second line,

978
01:47:03,125 --> 01:47:05,127
charge!

979
01:47:13,260 --> 01:47:14,344
No way.

980
01:47:21,184 --> 01:47:24,479
If we're engulfed,
our chain of command will fall apart.

981
01:47:31,778 --> 01:47:33,655
They're after General Ohki.

982
01:47:37,492 --> 01:47:38,994
We're engulfed!

983
01:48:07,230 --> 01:48:08,648
Shin, look!

984
01:48:42,265 --> 01:48:43,934
Hoken.

985
01:48:46,561 --> 01:48:47,687
You're finished!

986
01:49:20,679 --> 01:49:22,305
No!

987
01:49:22,389 --> 01:49:23,473
General Ohki!

988
01:49:32,065 --> 01:49:33,441
Bastard!

989
01:49:47,706 --> 01:49:49,749
Interference.

990
01:49:51,209 --> 01:49:53,795
This is why battlefields are dull.

991
01:49:56,172 --> 01:49:58,967
However, this is your place.

992
01:50:00,635 --> 01:50:02,595
You're finished.

993
01:50:03,305 --> 01:50:04,514
Ohki.

994
01:50:10,645 --> 01:50:14,816
How annoying it is
to have defeat forced upon you.

995
01:50:16,901 --> 01:50:20,071
I am angered by my men too.

996
01:50:22,490 --> 01:50:24,868
Why do you stop fighting?

997
01:50:29,748 --> 01:50:31,958
Even amidst death

998
01:50:33,501 --> 01:50:36,129
we will never give up.

999
01:50:37,130 --> 01:50:39,883
That's the pride of the Ohki army!

1000
01:50:46,014 --> 01:50:47,140
General Ohki.

1001
01:50:51,936 --> 01:50:53,480
I am still here.

1002
01:50:57,150 --> 01:50:59,903
This is not our place to die.

1003
01:51:39,317 --> 01:51:40,819
Bastard…

1004
01:51:41,444 --> 01:51:43,279
General is

1005
01:51:44,239 --> 01:51:46,950
nothing more than a position.

1006
01:51:48,034 --> 01:51:49,160
However,

1007
01:51:50,078 --> 01:51:54,374
only a few are able to reach
and achieve that position.

1008
01:51:58,711 --> 01:52:00,630
A general,

1009
01:52:01,673 --> 01:52:07,971
must overcome dangers
and make numerous accomplishments.

1010
01:52:10,181 --> 01:52:12,684
As a result, a general

1011
01:52:13,393 --> 01:52:17,939
holds responsibility for
the lives of tens and millions of men

1012
01:52:18,523 --> 01:52:20,942
and is rewarded with honor.

1013
01:52:30,618 --> 01:52:32,704
Who are you?

1014
01:52:33,955 --> 01:52:36,416
What in god's name are you?

1015
01:52:40,879 --> 01:52:42,797
What else could I be?

1016
01:52:44,799 --> 01:52:48,344
The greatest general on Earth!

1017
01:53:16,080 --> 01:53:17,499
All armies, through this gap!

1018
01:53:18,208 --> 01:53:21,461
We'll charge
straight to enemy headquarters,

1019
01:53:21,544 --> 01:53:23,087
and guard our Lord's unit!

1020
01:53:31,679 --> 01:53:33,056
Go, Shin!

1021
01:53:36,601 --> 01:53:38,686
Don't let them get away!

1022
01:53:39,187 --> 01:53:40,647
Leave them.

1023
01:53:44,275 --> 01:53:45,443
General Hoken…

1024
01:53:51,824 --> 01:53:52,951
Let them go.

1025
01:54:00,083 --> 01:54:03,378
Go after them! Stop their cavalry!

1026
01:54:20,311 --> 01:54:22,230
<i>Though Ohki is dying,</i>

1027
01:54:23,064 --> 01:54:26,109
they're still desperate to take him back.

1028
01:54:28,695 --> 01:54:32,073
The present Ohki army
could be the most powerful.

1029
01:54:33,324 --> 01:54:38,538
If we were in their shoes,
we would fight to our deaths too.

1030
01:54:40,164 --> 01:54:42,709
How heartbreaking.

1031
01:54:44,919 --> 01:54:47,088
This is why I dislike war.

1032
01:55:12,363 --> 01:55:15,783
You amaze me, Shin, my boy.

1033
01:55:17,118 --> 01:55:21,331
I have never seen my steed, Oh,
so obedient to anyone else.

1034
01:55:21,414 --> 01:55:25,251
It's running on its own.
I ain't doing nothing.

1035
01:55:38,973 --> 01:55:40,558
Shin, my boy.

1036
01:55:41,976 --> 01:55:44,187
Sit up straight.

1037
01:55:44,812 --> 01:55:46,606
Close your eyes.

1038
01:55:47,482 --> 01:55:49,817
Deep breaths.

1039
01:55:51,194 --> 01:55:52,195
What?

1040
01:55:52,695 --> 01:55:56,574
It's not every day that one gets
to ride with the great general.

1041
01:55:58,952 --> 01:56:01,871
A rare and precious experience.

1042
01:56:03,164 --> 01:56:06,918
-But…
-Close your eyes and breathe deeply.

1043
01:56:16,010 --> 01:56:18,262
Now listen carefully.

1044
01:56:19,639 --> 01:56:24,185
At this moment,
you are running through this battlefield

1045
01:56:24,686 --> 01:56:28,064
mounted on the general's horse.

1046
01:56:29,983 --> 01:56:31,609
When you understand,

1047
01:56:33,444 --> 01:56:35,905
open your eyes slowly

1048
01:56:37,240 --> 01:56:40,702
and take a good look
at everything before you.

1049
01:56:48,418 --> 01:56:52,130
The enemy masses, the enemy faces.

1050
01:56:53,464 --> 01:56:56,134
And the faces of your allies.

1051
01:57:04,392 --> 01:57:06,060
The sky and earth.

1052
01:57:14,986 --> 01:57:16,279
Behold.

1053
01:57:18,072 --> 01:57:20,700
The view only generals can see!

1054
01:57:46,642 --> 01:57:48,061
Do you get it?

1055
01:57:51,272 --> 01:57:55,276
Yeah, I think I'm starting to see
what it's like.

1056
01:57:58,446 --> 01:58:01,824
The eyes of the general
can see many things.

1057
01:58:04,035 --> 01:58:05,536
For example,

1058
01:58:06,287 --> 01:58:09,540
our way out is right before us.

1059
01:58:22,845 --> 01:58:24,013
Mobu.

1060
01:58:38,736 --> 01:58:40,696
My Lord!

1061
01:58:43,533 --> 01:58:46,452
Let us be on our way.

1062
01:58:47,912 --> 01:58:50,665
We shall escape this deathtrap.

1063
01:59:12,270 --> 01:59:15,982
Leave them to us.
Please stand by General Ohki.

1064
01:59:22,113 --> 01:59:25,658
Ohki has broken our blockade!

1065
01:59:32,707 --> 01:59:34,041
Why not go after Ohki?

1066
01:59:35,334 --> 01:59:36,752
Enough is done.

1067
01:59:38,045 --> 01:59:42,466
Ohki's life shall come to an end.
No need to chase them.

1068
01:59:42,550 --> 01:59:45,511
But if we don't bring back his head…

1069
01:59:46,762 --> 01:59:48,890
There are two types of commanders.

1070
01:59:50,099 --> 01:59:53,519
Once killed, his men's morale is lost,

1071
01:59:54,020 --> 01:59:55,938
ending the battle right there.

1072
01:59:56,647 --> 02:00:00,735
While the other,
becomes a symbol of martyrdom,

1073
02:00:00,818 --> 02:00:03,446
causing his men to fight till the end.

1074
02:00:04,780 --> 02:00:07,992
Ohki is no doubt the latter.

1075
02:00:11,204 --> 02:00:13,206
If we took Ohki's head,

1076
02:00:14,749 --> 02:00:20,630
his men would tremble with anger
and come at us on a suicide mission.

1077
02:00:22,131 --> 02:00:23,382
If this happens,

1078
02:00:24,425 --> 02:00:28,763
not even all our armies put together
wouldn't stand a chance.

1079
02:00:31,057 --> 02:00:32,308
The goal,

1080
02:00:33,142 --> 02:00:37,313
isn't to invade Qin
or to defeat the Ohki army.

1081
02:00:39,148 --> 02:00:41,317
It's the death of Ohki.

1082
02:00:43,778 --> 02:00:48,991
Now that our goal has been reached,
there's no meaning in more bloodshed.

1083
02:00:51,786 --> 02:00:56,874
None of us must die in vain.
I will not tolerate it.

1084
02:01:06,968 --> 02:01:08,261
The battle,

1085
02:01:09,136 --> 02:01:10,596
ends right here.

1086
02:01:53,973 --> 02:01:54,890
Toh.

1087
02:01:57,560 --> 02:01:58,394
My Lord.

1088
02:02:01,314 --> 02:02:06,944
I will not allow anyone to follow me
and take their lives.

1089
02:02:08,029 --> 02:02:10,781
Not even the commanders.

1090
02:02:13,451 --> 02:02:14,285
My Lord.

1091
02:02:16,829 --> 02:02:19,832
You have long supported me.

1092
02:02:20,958 --> 02:02:26,213
Your professional skills
have always been as good as mine.

1093
02:02:29,175 --> 02:02:32,928
I shall leave my men
and their future in your hands.

1094
02:02:41,103 --> 02:02:41,979
Kanoh.

1095
02:02:42,813 --> 02:02:44,106
Be my witness.

1096
02:02:46,525 --> 02:02:47,401
My Lord!

1097
02:02:52,239 --> 02:02:55,326
I'll be counting on you, Toh.

1098
02:03:07,838 --> 02:03:08,672
My Lord.

1099
02:03:22,895 --> 02:03:23,938
Ohki.

1100
02:03:26,482 --> 02:03:27,483
Forgive me.

1101
02:03:28,192 --> 02:03:30,194
This is all my fault.

1102
02:03:31,237 --> 02:03:32,655
Mobu.

1103
02:03:34,698 --> 02:03:37,535
Your problem is clear.

1104
02:03:37,618 --> 02:03:40,830
There's no need to go into that.

1105
02:03:42,331 --> 02:03:44,625
You will undoubtedly

1106
02:03:45,543 --> 02:03:49,088
become one of the best generals of Qin.

1107
02:03:51,549 --> 02:03:54,218
Keep that in mind.

1108
02:03:54,969 --> 02:03:58,097
I look forward to your future progress.

1109
02:04:00,516 --> 02:04:02,059
After all,

1110
02:04:03,561 --> 02:04:08,732
the Zhao general who appeared
turned out to be the toughest enemy ever.

1111
02:04:11,318 --> 02:04:14,530
We fell into their hands completely.

1112
02:04:21,579 --> 02:04:23,664
Honestly.

1113
02:04:24,665 --> 02:04:27,209
These are tough times.

1114
02:04:28,752 --> 02:04:32,673
No matter the era,
the strongest general appears

1115
02:04:34,258 --> 02:04:37,678
only to be defeated by another.

1116
02:04:39,013 --> 02:04:43,893
The wars of China revolve
around that man for a while.

1117
02:04:46,187 --> 02:04:49,773
But until when, is another matter.

1118
02:04:51,150 --> 02:04:54,737
He will always be defeated

1119
02:04:54,820 --> 02:04:58,157
and pass on his role of the era.

1120
02:05:02,203 --> 02:05:04,038
Those in power.

1121
02:05:05,331 --> 02:05:08,501
Their endless life-staking battle.

1122
02:05:13,839 --> 02:05:15,966
Honestly.

1123
02:05:16,967 --> 02:05:19,929
This is why these turbulent times are fun.

1124
02:05:36,195 --> 02:05:37,613
Shin, my boy.

1125
02:05:44,078 --> 02:05:46,914
I believe I promised to train you.

1126
02:05:48,290 --> 02:05:52,836
But as you can see,
that is no longer possible.

1127
02:05:55,464 --> 02:05:57,216
Besides,

1128
02:05:57,841 --> 02:06:03,222
how selfish of you to impose on me
to teach you directly.

1129
02:06:06,559 --> 02:06:08,561
Learn by

1130
02:06:09,603 --> 02:06:13,607
putting your time and effort in
on the battlefields.

1131
02:06:15,901 --> 02:06:17,194
You fool.

1132
02:06:29,456 --> 02:06:32,918
Strive like hell with your comrades.

1133
02:06:37,590 --> 02:06:39,425
You have talent.

1134
02:06:40,843 --> 02:06:41,802
Shin.

1135
02:07:03,907 --> 02:07:05,075
General Ohki?

1136
02:07:24,803 --> 02:07:26,180
General Ohki!

1137
02:07:33,479 --> 02:07:35,105
General Ohki!

1138
02:07:40,903 --> 02:07:43,364
My Lord!

1139
02:08:59,732 --> 02:09:01,108
Ohki…

1140
02:09:08,282 --> 02:09:10,242
Before Ohki set out to war,

1141
02:09:12,286 --> 02:09:14,788
he conveyed King Sho's will to me.

1142
02:09:19,084 --> 02:09:20,043
It was

1143
02:09:23,088 --> 02:09:26,508
a lecture on
what the King of China should be.

1144
02:09:29,428 --> 02:09:30,512
<i>Lastly,</i>

1145
02:09:33,015 --> 02:09:35,392
though compassion is needless,

1146
02:09:35,934 --> 02:09:39,438
do not treat those you conquer as slaves.

1147
02:09:39,938 --> 02:09:41,732
Do not oppress them

1148
02:09:43,192 --> 02:09:47,196
but treat them with the same love
as your people.

1149
02:09:49,239 --> 02:09:50,157
This is

1150
02:09:50,657 --> 02:09:56,121
the will I've been entrusted with
by King Sho for the present King of Qin.

1151
02:09:58,040 --> 02:10:00,000
I thank you, Ohki.

1152
02:10:01,502 --> 02:10:04,379
I had never been taught that by him.

1153
02:10:05,339 --> 02:10:07,841
Of course you haven't been taught.

1154
02:10:09,426 --> 02:10:12,971
I haven't even conveyed his words
to our former King.

1155
02:10:16,934 --> 02:10:18,101
These words

1156
02:10:18,811 --> 02:10:23,398
were only meant for the one
who is fit to take on King Sho's will.

1157
02:10:24,650 --> 02:10:28,570
King Sho left me responsible
for the decision.

1158
02:10:30,489 --> 02:10:35,536
To convey these words only to the one
who is worthy of my services.

1159
02:10:39,248 --> 02:10:40,207
Ohki.

1160
02:10:51,260 --> 02:10:53,679
Let us unite all of China.

1161
02:10:54,972 --> 02:10:56,014
Your Majesty!

1162
02:11:14,992 --> 02:11:17,369
That fool…

1163
02:12:08,962 --> 02:12:13,842
You've defeated your adversary,
yet you seem dissatisfied.

1164
02:12:16,595 --> 02:12:18,472
We will return to Zhao.

1165
02:12:19,556 --> 02:12:22,100
How about you, Hoken?

1166
02:12:25,103 --> 02:12:27,022
Train in the mountains?

1167
02:12:33,946 --> 02:12:36,365
The secret to Ohki's powers

1168
02:12:37,157 --> 02:12:39,326
was on the battlefield.

1169
02:12:41,620 --> 02:12:43,622
I will not fall for that.

1170
02:12:46,750 --> 02:12:48,710
I have no interest in this place.

1171
02:12:52,339 --> 02:12:54,049
I'll send a messenger.

1172
02:12:55,884 --> 02:12:59,888
If you ever change your mind,
we're here with open arms.

1173
02:13:10,607 --> 02:13:11,733
After all,

1174
02:13:13,485 --> 02:13:17,114
another era of turmoil is coming our way.

1175
02:15:04,638 --> 02:15:05,597
Shin.

1176
02:15:09,101 --> 02:15:10,143
General Toh.

1177
02:15:12,896 --> 02:15:14,064
Do me a favor.

1178
02:15:20,904 --> 02:15:24,574
Your Majesty,
the news of General Ohki's death

1179
02:15:25,367 --> 02:15:29,287
has brought a significant loss
to our state.

1180
02:15:34,918 --> 02:15:36,086
Exactly.

1181
02:15:37,629 --> 02:15:39,381
General Ohki was defeated.

1182
02:15:42,843 --> 02:15:47,472
However, with the dedicated support
of Ohki's army

1183
02:15:47,556 --> 02:15:51,518
Zhao retreated, and all of Bayo was saved.

1184
02:15:56,189 --> 02:15:57,482
Our state of Qin,

1185
02:15:58,400 --> 02:16:00,110
has won this battle.

1186
02:16:06,950 --> 02:16:08,702
<i>Moreover, our soldiers</i>

1187
02:16:10,412 --> 02:16:13,957
<i>did not give up our general to our enemy.</i>

1188
02:16:14,583 --> 02:16:18,920
<i>They will soon return to Xianyang</i>
<i>with his body.</i>

1189
02:16:22,465 --> 02:16:24,384
Though General Ohki is gone,

1190
02:16:26,595 --> 02:16:29,931
his soul will live forever inside us!

1191
02:16:46,781 --> 02:16:49,117
Shin of the Hishin Unit.

1192
02:16:51,494 --> 02:16:54,873
Speak if you have something to convey.

1193
02:17:31,159 --> 02:17:33,370
Lift up your heads!

1194
02:17:41,086 --> 02:17:43,004
We saved Bayo!

1195
02:17:45,757 --> 02:17:47,801
So, don't look down.

1196
02:17:54,766 --> 02:17:56,017
Hold your heads high.

1197
02:17:57,727 --> 02:17:59,521
Hold your heads high,

1198
02:18:00,605 --> 02:18:05,110
and return with General Ohki
in this moment of triumph!

1199
02:18:16,579 --> 02:18:18,498
Be proud!

1200
02:19:15,513 --> 02:19:17,640
Open our main gate!

1201
02:19:21,061 --> 02:19:24,898
As of now, our great general of Qin,

1202
02:19:27,108 --> 02:19:29,235
Ohki will return!

1203
02:19:42,874 --> 02:19:44,209
All armies…

1204
02:19:45,001 --> 02:19:46,544
forward!

1205
02:21:47,540 --> 02:21:50,835
