00:13:05,200 --> 00:13:08,120
You didn't jump in because you were worried about me, did you?

194
00:13:08,120 --> 00:13:10,150
I just acted on impulse.

195
00:13:10,520 --> 00:13:12,190
I don't know why I jumped in.

196
00:13:12,870 --> 00:13:15,480
Well, you're so brave.

197
00:13:17,550 --> 00:13:19,320
Actually, looking at it now,

198
00:13:19,630 --> 00:13:21,890
the water doesn't seem so scary anymore.

199
00:13:22,390 --> 00:13:24,440
But that day at the pool...

200
00:13:28,200 --> 00:13:28,800
I'm sorry.

201
00:13:30,320 --> 00:13:31,220
It's not your fault.

202
00:13:31,220 --> 00:13:32,580
I'm just too useless.

203
00:13:32,910 --> 00:13:34,310
I'm even afraid of water.

204
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:36,660
Whenever I get close to water,

205
00:13:37,600 --> 00:13:40,330
I remember how my dad looked in the water that day.

206
00:13:41,080 --> 00:13:43,140
It was as if he knew he was going to die.

207
00:13:43,630 --> 00:13:47,020
He desperately tried to reach the surface to see me one last time.

208
00:13:47,020 --> 00:13:49,500
And I couldn't do anything.

209
00:13:50,200 --> 00:13:52,260
He hadn't even started to enjoy life.

210
00:13:52,480 --> 00:13:54,210
He never got to see me graduate,

211
00:13:54,240 --> 00:13:57,000
never got the chance to fix the light by the door,

212
00:13:57,000 --> 00:14:00,010
never waited for New Year's to eat the dumplings I made.

213
00:14:00,010 --> 00:14:01,410
He just died so suddenly.

214
00:14:07,160 --> 00:14:08,420
What's wrong with you?

215
00:14:08,600 --> 00:14:10,730
Did I upset you by telling you all this?

216
00:14:18,060 --> 00:14:18,610
No.

217
00:14:21,530 --> 00:14:22,730
Don't be sad anymore.

218
00:14:24,320 --> 00:14:25,360
It'll pass.

219
00:14:25,920 --> 00:14:27,720
Death is inevitable sooner or later.

220
00:14:27,720 --> 00:14:28,920
We all have to face it.

221
00:14:29,510 --> 00:14:30,910
He's always by your side,

222
00:14:31,320 --> 00:14:33,270
just existing in a different form.

223
00:14:34,120 --> 00:14:36,600
He would want you to live happily too.

224
00:14:37,200 --> 00:14:38,800
I really want to comfort you,

225
00:14:40,390 --> 00:14:42,860
but I know how empty these words can sound.

226
00:14:45,720 --> 00:14:48,660
No one can truly understand what you're going through.

227
00:14:48,660 --> 00:14:49,820
Unless they've lost someone close,

228
00:14:49,820 --> 00:14:52,580
they just can't get it.

229
00:14:54,750 --> 00:14:56,480
Would you like to hear my story?

230
00:15:15,680 --> 00:15:17,930
[Invitation: Jiang Bohan]

231
00:15:17,550 --> 00:15:17,870
Bro,

232
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:19,750
I wrote a song.

233
00:15:19,750 --> 00:15:21,880
Can you take a look at the lyrics for me?

234
00:15:33,090 --> 00:15:34,570
Are you in love, kid?

235
00:15:35,480 --> 00:15:36,680
You seem so inspired.

236
00:15:36,870 --> 00:15:37,630
No.

237
00:15:39,030 --> 00:15:40,560
I've got a surprise for you.

238
00:15:42,840 --> 00:15:43,440
What surprise?

239
00:15:43,440 --> 00:15:44,440
Why so secretive?

240
00:15:45,360 --> 00:15:46,200
Just leave it here for now.

241
00:15:46,200 --> 00:15:47,190
I'll check it when I get back.

242
00:15:47,190 --> 00:15:47,720
Alright.

243
00:16:06,630 --> 00:16:07,870
Bohan, Boyang.

244
00:16:09,060 --> 00:16:11,190
The delicious afternoon tea is ready.

245
00:16:11,240 --> 00:16:11,700
Come on.

246
00:16:11,920 --> 00:16:12,690
Wow, this looks amazing.

247
00:16:12,690 --> 00:16:14,690
What's the special occasion today?

248
00:16:14,840 --> 00:16:16,500
Your big bro got a 4.0 GPA again

249
00:16:16,620 --> 00:16:18,030
this semester.

250
00:16:19,120 --> 00:16:20,120
That's awesome!

251
00:16:20,960 --> 00:16:22,280
See how excellent your brother is.

252
00:16:22,280 --> 00:16:23,840
When are you gonna step up

253
00:16:24,240 --> 00:16:25,670
and get first place in your class?

254
00:16:25,670 --> 00:16:27,600
Let Mom be proud of you for once too.

255
00:16:28,870 --> 00:16:29,200
Here,

256
00:16:29,880 --> 00:16:31,940
give your brother a piece as a reward.

257
00:16:32,120 --> 00:16:32,550
Here.

258
00:16:39,440 --> 00:16:40,440
Thanks, brother.

259
00:16:45,840 --> 00:16:46,550
Alright,

260
00:16:47,850 --> 00:16:48,560
you eat too.

261
00:16:50,120 --> 00:16:52,380
My little brother has a gift for the arts.

262
00:16:52,660 --> 00:16:55,660
He can play guitar, sing, and even write his own songs.

263
00:16:55,750 --> 00:16:57,150
But in my mother's eyes,

264
00:16:57,150 --> 00:17:00,010
none of that matters as much as getting good grades.

265
00:17:00,160 --> 00:17:01,080
He struggled with his studies

266
00:17:01,080 --> 00:17:02,610
and felt like he was stupid.

267
00:17:03,120 --> 00:17:03,790
Back then,

268
00:17:04,640 --> 00:17:07,339
I was only focused on playing basketball and studying,

269
00:17:07,339 --> 00:17:09,599
enjoying all kinds of praise and honors.

270
00:17:10,760 --> 00:17:12,760
I completely ignored his feelings.

271
00:17:15,030 --> 00:17:16,160
Later, I realized

272
00:17:16,670 --> 00:17:18,200
he had become melancholic.

273
00:17:19,060 --> 00:17:20,960
I thought it was because of songwriting

274
00:17:20,960 --> 00:17:22,420
that he became depressed.

275
00:17:24,270 --> 00:17:25,400
Why isn't he coming?

276
00:17:26,579 --> 00:17:27,980
It's just a performance.

277
00:17:28,099 --> 00:17:30,160
Why are you getting so angry about it?

278
00:17:31,230 --> 00:17:32,800
Did you stop him from coming?

279
00:17:32,800 --> 00:17:34,660
You didn't want me at your performance,

280
00:17:34,660 --> 00:17:36,400
but you secretly invited your brother.

281
00:17:36,400 --> 00:17:36,960
Now he's not coming,

282
00:17:36,960 --> 00:17:38,110
and you're blaming me?

283
00:17:38,110 --> 00:17:38,880
I don't invite you

284
00:17:38,880 --> 00:17:40,510
because you look down on me,

285
00:17:40,510 --> 00:17:42,440
you don't even care about my music.

286
00:17:42,470 --> 00:17:44,390
And now you're slamming the table at me?

287
00:17:44,390 --> 00:17:46,400
If your grades were like your brother's,

288
00:17:46,400 --> 00:17:48,400
I wouldn't mind your hobbies at all.

289
00:17:49,960 --> 00:17:51,200
I just want to play the guitar.

290
00:17:51,200 --> 00:17:52,510
I just want to sing.

291
00:17:53,190 --> 00:17:54,950
Why can't you support me?

292
00:17:55,960 --> 00:17:56,480
Alright, alright.

293
00:17:56,480 --> 00:17:57,610
I won't control you,

294
00:17:57,750 --> 00:17:58,670
but let me tell you,

295
00:17:58,670 --> 00:17:59,130
Boyang,

296
00:17:59,480 --> 00:18:01,210
you can't affect your brother.

297
00:18:01,350 --> 00:18:04,210
He's at a crucial time for his school applications.

298
00:18:04,720 --> 00:18:05,920
Don't lose your temper,

299
00:18:05,920 --> 00:18:07,050
and affect his mood.

300
00:18:07,070 --> 00:18:07,830
Got it?

301
00:18:09,680 --> 00:18:11,010
You only care about him.

302
00:18:11,750 --> 00:18:13,150
I'm not important at all.

303
00:18:14,310 --> 00:18:16,160
Am I even your son anymore?

304
00:18:21,510 --> 00:18:22,310
Jiang Boyang.
