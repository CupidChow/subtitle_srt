1
00:00:06,440 --> 00:00:08,700
What's his relationship with Yu Mingxi?

2
00:00:13,350 --> 00:00:15,550
Since when do you care so much about her?

3
00:00:18,800 --> 00:00:19,760
I care about you.

4
00:00:20,350 --> 00:00:21,410
You care about her.

5
00:00:21,880 --> 00:00:23,740
Of course I care about her as well.

6
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:27,330
I think they have a special relationship.

7
00:00:28,160 --> 00:00:28,600
Fine.

8
00:00:31,800 --> 00:00:34,130
I'll ask her for you when I have the chance.

9
00:00:37,150 --> 00:00:38,810
You're going to see her later,

10
00:00:39,280 --> 00:00:39,680
right?

11
00:00:49,760 --> 00:00:50,520
I envy her.

12
00:02:10,490 --> 00:02:13,300
[Close to You]

13
00:02:13,420 --> 00:02:15,810
[Episode 14: Rose Is for Her, But the Thorn Is for Me]

14
00:02:35,120 --> 00:02:36,180
Don't always sigh.

15
00:02:36,920 --> 00:02:39,450
If you sigh too much, your luck will get worse.

16
00:02:43,430 --> 00:02:45,000
Why the long face?

17
00:02:45,490 --> 00:02:46,640
It's not worth it

18
00:02:47,150 --> 00:02:47,870
for the guy just now.

19
00:02:47,870 --> 00:02:48,930
It's not about him.

20
00:02:50,030 --> 00:02:52,290
Were you thinking about the suspension?

21
00:02:53,150 --> 00:02:54,240
I was just thinking

22
00:02:54,630 --> 00:02:56,290
why things ended up like this.

23
00:02:56,960 --> 00:02:58,079
I didn't do anything,

24
00:02:58,079 --> 00:03:00,210
but I still need to prove my innocence.

25
00:03:03,300 --> 00:03:04,190
Let me ask you.

26
00:03:05,080 --> 00:03:06,010
How many friends

27
00:03:06,400 --> 00:03:07,800
can a person have at most?

28
00:03:09,680 --> 00:03:10,410
I don't know.

29
00:03:10,910 --> 00:03:12,560
But I have three friends now.

30
00:03:13,360 --> 00:03:14,000
You.

31
00:03:14,470 --> 00:03:15,000
Nian.

32
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:16,840
And...

33
00:03:17,430 --> 00:03:18,160
Jiang Bohan.

34
00:03:18,280 --> 00:03:19,880
He's one of your friends now?

35
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:27,130
According to the big data statistics,

36
00:03:27,190 --> 00:03:29,190
there are at most five close people.

37
00:03:29,750 --> 00:03:30,840
The number of people you can chat with

38
00:03:30,840 --> 00:03:31,470
is 15.

39
00:03:31,910 --> 00:03:33,450
And there are about 100 nodding friends.

40
00:03:33,450 --> 00:03:35,610
Less than 150 people in total.

41
00:03:36,910 --> 00:03:38,560
How many are there in Jingcai College?

42
00:03:38,560 --> 00:03:40,290
Approximately a few thousand?

43
00:03:40,970 --> 00:03:43,200
How can you possibly make so many people know you

44
00:03:43,200 --> 00:03:44,250
and acknowledge you?

45
00:03:44,250 --> 00:03:46,630
But they can't distort the truth or make trouble out of nothing.

46
00:03:46,630 --> 00:03:49,030
Gossip is just the way they socialize.

47
00:03:49,030 --> 00:03:50,520
Don't take it seriously.

48
00:03:51,140 --> 00:03:54,020
You'll be completely free

49
00:03:54,510 --> 00:03:57,040
when you stop caring about what others think.

50
00:03:58,760 --> 00:03:59,620
Don't you care?

51
00:04:00,520 --> 00:04:01,430
I never care.

52
00:04:04,800 --> 00:04:05,560
Well,

53
00:04:05,870 --> 00:04:07,600
what about your loss in boxing?

54
00:04:09,470 --> 00:04:10,600
That doesn't count.

55
00:04:12,430 --> 00:04:13,000
Anyway,

56
00:04:14,120 --> 00:04:16,510
human life is so short.

57
00:04:16,959 --> 00:04:18,839
I don't want to waste my time

58
00:04:19,750 --> 00:04:21,680
on unimportant people and things.

59
00:04:25,680 --> 00:04:26,480
You're right.

60
00:04:26,600 --> 00:04:27,120
So,

61
00:04:28,430 --> 00:04:30,310
you have to choose carefully

62
00:04:30,980 --> 00:04:32,940
who can enter your life.

63
00:04:35,909 --> 00:04:36,640
Understand?

64
00:04:44,480 --> 00:04:45,280
Yu Mingxi!

65
00:04:45,930 --> 00:04:46,990
Do you understand?

66
00:04:47,600 --> 00:04:48,240
So silly.

67
00:04:50,680 --> 00:04:51,310
Get up.

68
00:04:51,330 --> 00:04:52,930
Let's shout aloud together.

69
00:04:53,630 --> 00:04:54,630
Yu Mingxi!

70
00:04:54,970 --> 00:04:56,030
Do you understand?

71
00:04:56,730 --> 00:04:58,360
Understand.

72
00:04:58,380 --> 00:04:59,240
Louder!

73
00:05:00,360 --> 00:05:01,600
Understand!

74
00:05:02,610 --> 00:05:03,400
Come on!

75
00:05:04,460 --> 00:05:05,770
Understand!

76
00:05:29,550 --> 00:05:30,280
You're home.

77
00:05:32,560 --> 00:05:33,020
Go back.

78
00:05:38,120 --> 00:05:39,250
I need to talk to you.

79
00:05:42,120 --> 00:05:42,870
What else

80
00:05:42,870 --> 00:05:43,800
haven't I heard?

81
00:05:55,440 --> 00:05:56,170
Rest early.

82
00:05:59,120 --> 00:05:59,850
Jiang Bohan.

83
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:09,400
I don't like you anymore.

84
00:06:20,160 --> 00:06:21,750
I just want to tell you that

85
00:06:23,080 --> 00:06:24,680
I don't think you deserve me.

86
00:06:34,680 --> 00:06:35,480
From now on,

87
00:06:38,070 --> 00:06:39,600
we are just normal friends.

88
00:06:47,190 --> 00:06:47,720
Okay.

89
00:06:48,250 --> 00:06:49,450
Just normal friends.

90
00:06:53,290 --> 00:06:54,680
Given what I said today,

91
00:06:57,409 --> 00:06:59,140
there's no turning back for me.

92
00:07:02,160 --> 00:07:03,620
I can't embarrass myself.

93
00:07:13,760 --> 00:07:16,090
But you still have to go to the ball with me.

94
00:07:20,950 --> 00:07:21,720
Consider it

95
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:25,800
the last time.

96
00:07:46,170 --> 00:07:47,030
New boyfriend?

97
00:07:47,550 --> 00:07:48,120
Manager,

98
00:07:48,140 --> 00:07:48,900
stop joking.

99
00:07:49,010 --> 00:07:50,340
He is my little brother.

100
00:07:50,750 --> 00:07:51,120
Hey.

101
00:07:51,360 --> 00:07:54,120
You just said you were only two months older than me.

102
00:07:54,120 --> 00:07:54,890
That's what makes you

103
00:07:54,890 --> 00:07:55,950
my little brother.

104
00:07:56,830 --> 00:07:57,159
Fine.

105
00:07:57,830 --> 00:07:58,850
Here comes the double standard, huh?

106
00:07:58,850 --> 00:07:59,360
Here.

107
00:07:59,770 --> 00:08:00,900
Thank you, Manager.

108
00:08:01,040 --> 00:08:02,090
Turn off the lights when you leave.

109
00:08:02,090 --> 00:08:02,420
Okay.

110
00:08:02,420 --> 00:08:03,080
Let me do it.

111
00:08:03,480 --> 00:08:04,040
Bye, Little Brother.

112
00:08:04,040 --> 00:08:04,580
Okay. Okay.

113
00:08:04,580 --> 00:08:05,380
Bye, Manager.

114
00:08:05,800 --> 00:08:07,040
So enthusiastic?

115
00:08:07,310 --> 00:08:08,170
Are you hungry?

116
00:08:12,480 --> 00:08:13,090
So,

117
00:08:13,630 --> 00:08:16,090
that's how those near-expired foods at home

118
00:08:17,480 --> 00:08:18,140
came about?

119
00:08:19,250 --> 00:08:19,800
Yeah.

120
00:08:20,130 --> 00:08:21,370
I think it's good.

121
00:08:21,890 --> 00:08:22,600
In doing so,

122
00:08:22,620 --> 00:08:23,560
it saves money

123
00:08:23,580 --> 00:08:25,040
without wasting any food.

124
00:08:35,309 --> 00:08:36,039
Uncle

125
00:08:36,600 --> 00:08:37,799
has owed a lot, right?

126
00:08:40,340 --> 00:08:41,940
Why are you bringing that up?

127
00:08:45,630 --> 00:08:46,590
How much debt is left now?

128
00:08:46,590 --> 00:08:48,050
Let me help you pay it back.

129
00:08:48,670 --> 00:08:49,690
What are you talking about?

130
00:08:49,690 --> 00:08:51,360
How could I possibly ask you to do that?

131
00:08:51,360 --> 00:08:52,530
If it weren't for my dad,

132
00:08:52,530 --> 00:08:54,310
your dad wouldn't have made an investment,

133
00:08:54,310 --> 00:08:56,040
nor would he have been swindled out of money.

134
00:08:56,040 --> 00:08:56,940
Given what you just said,

135
00:08:56,940 --> 00:08:58,000
it's also my fault.

136
00:08:58,510 --> 00:09:00,720
If my dad hadn't forced me to go to Jingcai College,

137
00:09:00,720 --> 00:09:02,360
he wouldn't have been in such a hurry to make money,

138
00:09:02,360 --> 00:09:03,960
nor would he have taken the risk

139
00:09:03,960 --> 00:09:05,420
to borrow money to invest.

140
00:09:07,630 --> 00:09:08,490
No matter what,

141
00:09:09,030 --> 00:09:09,960
my dad

142
00:09:09,980 --> 00:09:11,400
dragged your family into this.

143
00:09:11,400 --> 00:09:12,930
I'll take responsibility.

144
00:09:13,720 --> 00:09:14,320
You

145
00:09:14,490 --> 00:09:15,420
are not your dad.

146
00:09:15,520 --> 00:09:16,880
You have your own life.

147
00:09:19,060 --> 00:09:20,260
What about your life?

148
00:09:24,760 --> 00:09:25,790
My mom and I

149
00:09:25,930 --> 00:09:28,130
have a serious plan to pay back the debt.

150
00:09:29,070 --> 00:09:30,420
If everything goes well,

151
00:09:30,420 --> 00:09:32,150
we can clear the debt this year.

152
00:09:32,840 --> 00:09:34,150
I think it's good.

153
00:09:36,200 --> 00:09:37,670
Your class has been suspended.

154
00:09:37,670 --> 00:09:39,000
What's so good about it?

155
00:09:40,210 --> 00:09:42,070
You're so annoying, You Jingchu.

156
00:09:42,200 --> 00:09:43,270
Why are you bringing that up?

157
00:09:43,270 --> 00:09:44,720
I finally forgot it!

158
00:09:46,270 --> 00:09:46,870
Let's forget about it.

159
00:09:46,870 --> 00:09:47,840
Let's forget about it.

160
00:09:47,840 --> 00:09:48,510
I'll take a shower first

161
00:09:48,510 --> 00:09:49,180

162
00:09:49,180 --> 00:09:50,380
Don't fight me for it.

163
00:09:51,720 --> 00:09:52,570
Remember to turn off the lights and lock the door.

164
00:09:52,570 --> 00:09:53,100
Bye-bye.

165
00:09:53,960 --> 00:09:55,030
Whoever gets home first

166
00:09:55,030 --> 00:09:55,980
takes a shower!

167
00:09:58,180 --> 00:09:58,770
Gosh...

168
00:09:58,900 --> 00:10:00,630
You Jingchu, stop right there!

169
00:10:12,080 --> 00:10:12,720
Hurry.

170
00:10:12,840 --> 00:10:13,640
Open the door.

172
00:10:55,600 --> 00:10:56,730
If you're not ready,

173
00:10:58,440 --> 00:10:59,970
you don't have to answer it.

174
00:11:07,700 --> 00:11:09,300
Do you want something to eat?

175
00:11:12,840 --> 00:11:14,390
Can I eat this red bean bun?

176
00:11:16,940 --> 00:11:17,480
No.

177
00:11:17,630 --> 00:11:19,430
This is for Nian to eat tomorrow.

178
00:11:24,470 --> 00:11:25,030
I'm going to sleep.

179
00:11:25,030 --> 00:11:26,760
You should go to bed early, too.

180
00:12:07,120 --> 00:12:08,790
He and Qin Siyao grew up together.

181
00:12:08,790 --> 00:12:11,050
Why am I getting worked up over this here?

182
00:12:14,120 --> 00:12:15,280
He said he likes you.

183
00:12:15,310 --> 00:12:16,370
Yet you really believed it?

184
00:12:16,370 --> 00:12:17,770
Don't flatter yourself.

185
00:12:23,270 --> 00:12:23,800
Come out.

186
00:12:24,090 --> 00:12:25,290
I'm at your doorstep.

187
00:12:39,550 --> 00:12:40,080
Oh no.

188
00:12:40,080 --> 00:12:40,910
Why is he here?

189
00:12:51,850 --> 00:12:52,630
I'm going to bed.

190
00:12:52,630 --> 00:12:53,870
Let's talk tomorrow.

191
00:12:58,300 --> 00:12:59,630
I have to talk to you now.

192

00:13:19,550 --> 00:13:20,270
Yu Mingxi.

195
00:13:22,520 --> 00:13:23,400
Yu Mingxi.

196
00:13:24,960 --> 00:13:25,890
I'll count to 10.

197
00:13:25,940 --> 00:13:27,740
I'll shout if you don't come out.

198
00:13:28,430 --> 00:13:29,030
Ten.

199
00:13:31,210 --> 00:13:31,850
Nine.

200
00:13:33,630 --> 00:13:34,200
Eight.

201
00:13:36,240 --> 00:13:36,870
Seven.

202
00:13:38,630 --> 00:13:39,240
Six.

203
00:13:40,550 --> 00:13:41,440
Five.

204
00:13:42,820 --> 00:13:44,140
What a lunatic.

205
00:13:45,080 --> 00:13:45,670
Four.

206
00:13:49,570 --> 00:13:50,180
Three.

207
00:13:54,030 --> 00:13:54,480
Two.

208
00:13:57,480 --> 00:13:58,200
One.

209
00:13:58,550 --> 00:13:58,960
Stop shouting.

210
00:13:58,960 --> 00:13:59,750
I'm here now.

211
00:14:08,150 --> 00:14:09,060
Jiang Bohan, are you crazy?

212
00:14:09,060 --> 00:14:10,600
Are you going to wake up all the residents in this building?

213
00:14:10,600 --> 00:14:11,530
What do you want?

214
00:14:11,570 --> 00:14:12,170
What is it?

215
00:14:13,810 --> 00:14:14,440
Talk here?

216
00:14:14,460 --> 00:14:14,820
Yes.

217
00:14:18,030 --> 00:14:19,870
Why didn't you answer your phone?

218
00:14:19,870 --> 00:14:20,670
Are you angry?

219
00:14:21,030 --> 00:14:22,200
I'm not your childhood friend.

220
00:14:22,200 --> 00:14:23,400
Why should I be angry?

221
00:14:24,140 --> 00:14:25,150
Don't be.

222
00:14:25,150 --> 00:14:27,150
There's nothing between me and her.

223
00:14:29,660 --> 00:14:30,030
Yes.

224
00:14:30,050 --> 00:14:30,750
Nothing.

225
00:14:31,320 --> 00:14:33,320
It's just a bouquet and a hug, right?

226
00:14:35,370 --> 00:14:36,100
Do you care about me?

227
00:14:36,100 --> 00:14:36,750
No.

228
00:14:41,080 --> 00:14:42,280
Let's talk about you.

229
00:14:42,750 --> 00:14:43,950
What's wrong with me?

230
00:14:44,360 --> 00:14:45,760
Who is You Jingchu to you?

231
00:14:46,040 --> 00:14:47,900
What kind of little brother is he?

232
00:14:48,360 --> 00:14:50,490
Why can he stay at your home for so long?

233
00:14:50,950 --> 00:14:52,960
His father and my dad are good friends.

234
00:14:52,960 --> 00:14:54,030
He's new here.

235
00:14:54,050 --> 00:14:55,360
Of course I have to take care of him.

236
00:14:55,360 --> 00:14:56,600
Then I can help rent a house for him,

237
00:14:56,600 --> 00:14:57,860
so he can live outside.

238
00:14:57,870 --> 00:14:59,790
How could I let you pay?

239
00:14:59,870 --> 00:15:00,340
Besides,

240
00:15:00,340 --> 00:15:01,450
he might not want to.

241
00:15:01,450 --> 00:15:03,980
But he can't stay at your home forever, right?

242
00:15:04,850 --> 00:15:07,250
He's just staying at my place temporarily.

243
00:15:09,030 --> 00:15:09,960
No way.

244
00:15:16,930 --> 00:15:17,680
Hello?

245
00:15:19,360 --> 00:15:20,270
Headmistress?

246
00:15:20,620 --> 00:15:21,250
Hello, Headmistress.

247
00:15:21,250 --> 00:15:22,650
Is there anything wrong?

248
00:15:25,200 --> 00:15:26,030
Really?

249
00:15:27,240 --> 00:15:28,700
