I don't know.

00:00:37,280 --> 00:00:38,110

May I ask if you've seen Jiang Bohan?

14
00:00:58,750 --> 00:00:59,750
Haven't seen him.

No, he didn't.

24
00:01:15,710 --> 00:01:17,620
He's been acting all mysterious lately.

29
00:01:24,070 --> 00:01:24,870
Of course not.

30
00:01:28,120 --> 00:01:29,590
Is it possible

31
00:01:29,870 --> 00:01:31,930
that he might be in danger somewhere?

33

00:12:25,630 --> 00:12:27,090
you indeed have your ways.

192
00:12:27,580 --> 00:12:29,110
How am I inferior to you?

193
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:33,930
Don't expose your emotions easily

194
00:12:34,280 --> 00:12:36,140
to let others know your weakness.

195
00:12:37,440 --> 00:12:39,240
Whether you improve your skills

196
00:12:40,030 --> 00:12:41,700
or use connections,

197
00:12:43,270 --> 00:12:45,000
you can use any means necessary

198
00:12:45,300 --> 00:12:46,980
to achieve your goal.

199
00:13:01,270 --> 00:13:01,790
Hello?

200
00:13:02,550 --> 00:13:03,360
Auntie Jiang.

201
00:13:04,770 --> 00:13:05,440
It's me.

202
00:13:05,940 --> 00:13:07,200
I came to see you today.

203
00:13:09,040 --> 00:13:09,840
It's nothing.

204
00:13:10,280 --> 00:13:11,280
I'll leave soon.

205
00:13:26,110 --> 00:13:27,380
What would you like to drink?

206
00:13:27,380 --> 00:13:28,670
Just boiled water is fine.

207
00:13:28,670 --> 00:13:29,240
I don't have any.

208
00:13:29,240 --> 00:13:30,390
I'll just grab something for you.

209
00:13:30,390 --> 00:13:31,060
Okay.

210
00:13:31,080 --> 00:13:31,630
Thanks.

211
00:13:38,690 --> 00:13:39,090
Here.

212
00:13:51,550 --> 00:13:52,670
So,

213
00:13:53,400 --> 00:13:55,130
you didn't come to school today

214
00:13:55,150 --> 00:13:56,810
just because of those people?

215
00:13:57,750 --> 00:13:58,150
No,

216
00:13:59,170 --> 00:13:59,900
I overslept.

217
00:14:01,910 --> 00:14:02,960
Are you sure?

218
00:14:06,270 --> 00:14:06,870
Are...

219
00:14:07,140 --> 00:14:08,270
You caring about me?

220
00:14:10,030 --> 00:14:10,910
I'm not.

221
00:14:13,240 --> 00:14:13,910
However,

222
00:14:14,720 --> 00:14:17,180
why do those people always give you trouble?

223
00:14:17,750 --> 00:14:18,880
I don't know either.

224
00:14:19,720 --> 00:14:21,420
Just forget it if you don't want to say anything.

225
00:14:21,420 --> 00:14:22,210
Anyway,

226
00:14:22,480 --> 00:14:24,140
I pretty much know it already.

227
00:14:24,960 --> 00:14:26,620
What do you think you know now?

228
00:14:28,270 --> 00:14:29,200
Because...

229
00:14:34,450 --> 00:14:35,180
Who is it?

230
00:14:35,710 --> 00:14:36,910
I think my mom is back.

231
00:14:37,940 --> 00:14:38,720
Headmaster?

232
00:14:38,760 --> 00:14:39,690
What should I do?

233
00:14:40,720 --> 00:14:41,480
This is Headmaster.

234
00:14:41,480 --> 00:14:42,610
Where should I hide?

235
00:14:43,060 --> 00:14:43,990
What should I do?

236
00:14:44,400 --> 00:14:45,080
I'm over. It's all over.

237
00:14:45,080 --> 00:14:46,240
What should I do?

238
00:14:48,480 --> 00:14:49,670
What should I do?

239
00:14:58,270 --> 00:15:00,530
Bohan, you haven't had dinner, have you?

240
00:15:00,720 --> 00:15:01,520
No, I haven't.

241
00:15:04,360 --> 00:15:06,360
Yao just called and said she came by.

242
00:15:09,100 --> 00:15:10,700
I met her briefly at the door.

243
00:15:14,360 --> 00:15:15,680
Is this milk yours?

244
00:15:19,510 --> 00:15:21,970
Since when did you start liking this flavor?

245
00:15:26,580 --> 00:15:27,580
I like it now.

246
00:15:41,290 --> 00:15:42,360
What do you want to eat tonight?

247
00:15:42,360 --> 00:15:43,360
I'll cook for you.

248
00:15:43,680 --> 00:15:44,680
Anything is fine.

249
00:15:46,550 --> 00:15:47,550
When did you

250
00:15:47,550 --> 00:15:49,960
buy so much strawberry-flavored milk?

251
00:15:53,670 --> 00:15:54,400
Jiang Bohan,

252
00:15:55,030 --> 00:15:58,230
your clothes are so dirty. Why are you still wearing them?

253
00:15:58,310 --> 00:16:00,040
Did you get into another fight?

254
00:16:03,040 --> 00:16:05,300
Take off your clothes and give them to me.

255
00:16:09,070 --> 00:16:09,810
Jiang Bohan.

256
00:16:10,540 --> 00:16:11,740
What should we do now?

257
00:16:53,720 --> 00:16:54,920
What should we do now?

258
00:16:56,390 --> 00:16:58,190
Jiang Bohan, what are you doing?

259
00:16:58,480 --> 00:17:00,080
My mom asked me to change clothes.

260
00:17:00,080 --> 00:17:01,740
I can't go out to change, can I?

261
00:17:02,190 --> 00:17:04,319
Let me know when you're done changing.

262
00:17:04,849 --> 00:17:06,980
I'll go downstairs for dinner in a bit.

263
00:17:07,310 --> 00:17:09,180
I'll find a chance for you to leave.

264
00:17:09,180 --> 00:17:10,210
Now?

265
00:17:10,680 --> 00:17:13,010
Should I wait until Headmaster is asleep?

266
00:17:13,950 --> 00:17:15,550
It's only seven o'clock now.

267
00:17:15,589 --> 00:17:17,119
Wait until my mom is asleep?

268
00:17:17,250 --> 00:17:18,450
You want to stay here?

269
00:17:18,910 --> 00:17:19,910
I'll do as you say.

270
00:17:28,349 --> 00:17:29,410
I'm done changing.

271
00:17:30,180 --> 00:17:32,240
So, what do you think we should do now?

272
00:17:34,160 --> 00:17:36,290
You have to agree to a condition first.

273
00:17:36,880 --> 00:17:38,920
You're taking advantage of the situation.

274
00:17:38,920 --> 00:17:40,110
I...

275
00:17:43,810 --> 00:17:45,810
Tell me what the condition is first.

276
00:17:50,370 --> 00:17:51,970
Don't avoid me in the future.

277
00:18:03,500 --> 00:18:07,640
[Close to You]
