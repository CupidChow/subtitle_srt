I've got a cold.

00:06:15,630 --> 00:06:17,090

106

107
00:07:52,510 --> 00:07:53,360

and let her back to class.

118
00:09:13,750 --> 00:09:15,240

119
00:09:18,320 --> 00:09:19,580

122
00:09:28,070 --> 00:09:29,510
I want you to go on a date with me

123
00:09:29,510 --> 00:09:31,270
and send me flowers at my concert.

124
00:09:31,270 --> 00:09:31,670
No way.

125
00:09:32,330 --> 00:09:33,200
Something else.

126
00:09:33,200 --> 00:09:34,060
Forget it then.

127
00:09:40,840 --> 00:09:41,200
Wait.

128
00:09:43,480 --> 00:09:44,880
Fine, I'll date with you.

129
00:09:45,400 --> 00:09:46,640
But just for today.

130
00:09:49,440 --> 00:09:50,510
Starting now.

131
00:09:59,080 --> 00:10:01,740
Why does Qin Siyao go to school with Jiang Bohan?

132
00:10:02,080 --> 00:10:04,880

00:10:23,910 --> 00:10:25,840

00:10:32,170 --> 00:10:32,830
You tell me.

144
00:10:33,220 --> 00:10:33,950
I wonder too.

145
00:10:34,600 --> 00:10:37,260
I don't think Captain signed up for this course.

146
00:10:39,320 --> 00:10:40,980
Let's start with a question:

147
00:10:41,440 --> 00:10:42,900
If the parameter changes,

148
00:10:43,390 --> 00:10:45,550
will the roots of the equation change?

149
00:10:46,630 --> 00:10:49,030
That is, what happens to the number of roots

150
00:10:49,390 --> 00:10:51,120
when the parameter increases?

151
00:10:52,120 --> 00:10:54,550
If we figure that out, we can find the critical points

152
00:10:54,550 --> 00:10:55,960
and solve the problem.

153
00:10:55,960 --> 00:10:56,890
What's going on?

154
00:10:57,080 --> 00:10:59,140
Why didn't you tell us you're dating?

155
00:10:59,510 --> 00:11:00,320
Jiang Bohan,

156
00:11:01,030 --> 00:11:02,830
come up and solve this question.

157
00:11:13,240 --> 00:11:14,040
I'll go with D.

158
00:11:18,440 --> 00:11:19,000
Ma'am,

159
00:11:20,200 --> 00:11:21,440
I've solved this question before.

160
00:11:21,440 --> 00:11:21,970
Alright.

161
00:11:22,030 --> 00:11:22,790
Sit down.

162
00:11:23,280 --> 00:11:24,670
Pay attention in class.

163
00:11:26,390 --> 00:11:27,150
Jiang Bohan,

164
00:11:28,200 --> 00:11:29,930
aren't you in the senior class?

165
00:11:30,440 --> 00:11:31,030
Ma'am,

166
00:11:31,050 --> 00:11:32,380
he came to class with me.

167
00:11:35,530 --> 00:11:36,370
Alright.

168
00:11:36,910 --> 00:11:38,990
It's good to help others study.

169
00:11:39,610 --> 00:11:41,410
The one with glasses at the back,

170
00:11:41,630 --> 00:11:43,690
come up and write down your solution.

171
00:12:08,920 --> 00:12:09,830
Sorry, Ma'am.

172
00:12:10,040 --> 00:12:12,240
I don't know how to solve this question.

173
00:12:25,120 --> 00:12:26,180
Congratulations.

174
00:12:26,720 --> 00:12:28,450
The performance was a success.

175
00:12:29,120 --> 00:12:30,320
Thank you for coming.

176
00:12:36,900 --> 00:12:38,100
Is this fun?

177
00:12:41,690 --> 00:12:43,350
When did you become so stingy?

178
00:12:55,960 --> 00:12:56,720
Mingxi.

179
00:12:57,030 --> 00:12:58,030
I found

180
00:12:58,360 --> 00:13:01,270
Jiang Bohan and Qin Siyao grew up together.

181
00:13:01,290 --> 00:13:03,320
They made it public at school today.

182
00:13:03,510 --> 00:13:04,970
Check out the photo I took.

183
00:13:05,870 --> 00:13:07,440
I really don't get it.

184
00:13:07,600 --> 00:13:09,220
They used to act like they had a blood feud.

185
00:13:09,220 --> 00:13:11,220
Now they're showing off their love.

186
00:13:16,960 --> 00:13:18,290
What are you looking at?

187
00:13:18,790 --> 00:13:21,480
Are you part of their play?

188
00:13:23,200 --> 00:13:23,630
What?

189
00:13:24,390 --> 00:13:25,990
I didn't say anything wrong.

190
00:13:27,080 --> 00:13:28,610
They are in a relationship.

191
00:13:31,200 --> 00:13:32,060
How do you know?

192
00:13:36,280 --> 00:13:37,910
Actually,

193
00:13:37,980 --> 00:13:39,380
I met Jiang Bohan before.

194
00:13:39,780 --> 00:13:41,600
He was with this girl back then.

195
00:13:43,030 --> 00:13:43,840
When?

196
00:13:55,220 --> 00:13:56,240
The road is so wide.

197
00:13:56,240 --> 00:13:57,040
Are you blind?

198
00:14:01,240 --> 00:14:02,120
No apology?

199
00:14:04,150 --> 00:14:04,870
Why?

200
00:14:07,510 --> 00:14:08,710
You're from Jingcai?

201
00:14:09,440 --> 00:14:10,960
No wonder you're so arrogant.

202
00:14:10,960 --> 00:14:11,890
What do you mean?

203
00:14:14,120 --> 00:14:15,550
I mean

204
00:14:16,320 --> 00:14:18,080
how would students from Jingcai

205
00:14:18,080 --> 00:14:20,320
ride bikes to school?

206
00:14:20,870 --> 00:14:22,200
Try catching up with me.

207
00:14:31,670 --> 00:14:32,730
Why are you so late?

208
00:14:32,790 --> 00:14:33,910
The show is about to start.

209
00:14:33,910 --> 00:14:34,440
Let's go.

210
00:14:40,790 --> 00:14:43,030
I just can't stand those from Jingcai.

211
00:14:43,420 --> 00:14:45,330
There's nothing to be proud of.

212
00:14:46,320 --> 00:14:47,720
I'm from Jingcai now too.

213
00:14:48,120 --> 00:14:49,180
You're different.

214
00:14:52,240 --> 00:14:52,840
Well,

215
00:14:53,720 --> 00:14:56,150
when was that?

216
00:14:58,550 --> 00:14:59,790
About...

217
00:15:01,120 --> 00:15:01,920
two years ago.

218
00:15:03,840 --> 00:15:06,120
They were fine two years ago.

219
00:15:11,020 --> 00:15:12,280
What are you thinking?

220
00:15:14,510 --> 00:15:15,040
Nothing.

221
00:15:15,240 --> 00:15:16,370
Let's pack up and go.

222
00:15:17,240 --> 00:15:17,630
Go?

223
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:19,840
Where are we going?

224
00:15:19,840 --> 00:15:20,500
To work out.

225
00:15:21,070 --> 00:15:22,270
What kind of workout?

226
00:15:22,320 --> 00:15:23,920
You'll see when we get there.

227
00:15:24,080 --> 00:15:24,510
Get up.

228
00:15:24,820 --> 00:15:25,820
Let's go for a run.

229
00:15:32,600 --> 00:15:32,930
Corn.

230
00:15:34,630 --> 00:15:35,150
Corn.

231
00:15:35,550 --> 00:15:35,880
Corn.

232
00:15:36,720 --> 00:15:38,250
It has been ten kilometers.

233
00:15:38,320 --> 00:15:39,380
Let's take a break.

234
00:15:43,720 --> 00:15:44,080
Wait,

235
00:15:44,510 --> 00:15:46,370
I think you're getting back at me.

236
00:15:47,030 --> 00:15:48,200
Cut the crap.

237
00:15:48,200 --> 00:15:49,930
Whoever comes late will treat.

238
00:15:55,960 --> 00:15:58,760
On a spring night, drunk with the breeze, I met you.

239
00:15:59,050 --> 00:16:01,250
Since then, all winds are the same to me.

240
00:16:02,340 --> 00:16:03,650
Morning is night.

241
00:16:05,420 --> 00:16:07,550
Not thinking of you is thinking of you.

242
00:16:08,630 --> 00:16:09,550
But

243
00:16:09,790 --> 00:16:11,600
it seems like early autumn now.

244
00:16:13,360 --> 00:16:14,090
Jiang Bohan,

245
00:16:14,270 --> 00:16:16,470
you really don't get the romance at all.

246
00:16:17,080 --> 00:16:17,680
Is that so?

247
00:16:22,270 --> 00:16:23,220
After tonight,

248
00:16:24,720 --> 00:16:26,080
our agreement ends.

249
00:16:26,750 --> 00:16:27,840
So I hope

250
00:16:28,240 --> 00:16:29,300
time passes slowly

251
00:16:30,440 --> 00:16:32,500
and the pumpkin carriage comes late.

252
00:16:34,270 --> 00:16:35,630
You're not Cinderella.

253
00:16:37,200 --> 00:16:39,260
Cinderella has her Prince Charming.

254
00:16:42,240 --> 00:16:44,100
You still believe in fairy tales?

255
00:16:44,340 --> 00:16:45,150
Why not?

256
00:16:46,160 --> 00:16:48,080
I feel our life before

257
00:16:49,280 --> 00:16:50,480
was like a fairy tale.

258
00:16:56,840 --> 00:16:57,200
Yes.

259
00:16:58,840 --> 00:17:00,080
The previous life

260
00:17:02,480 --> 00:17:03,410
was quite happy.

261
00:17:06,109 --> 00:17:07,000
Happy things

262
00:17:07,819 --> 00:17:09,950
are worth remembering for a lifetime.

263
00:17:11,640 --> 00:17:13,030
Why are you cheating?

264
00:17:29,270 --> 00:17:29,640
Hi.

265
00:17:30,640 --> 00:17:31,770
What a coincidence.

266
00:17:33,590 --> 00:17:34,920
I just finished my show.

267
00:17:35,090 --> 00:17:36,750
Jiang Bohan is taking me home.

268
00:17:37,750 --> 00:17:38,750
And you are...

269
00:17:41,920 --> 00:17:43,640
We're here for training.

270
00:17:45,810 --> 00:17:47,030
I'm here to accompany Corn

271
00:17:47,030 --> 00:17:48,030
for her training.

272
00:17:51,480 --> 00:17:53,070
We won't disturb your date.

273
00:18:01,180 --> 00:18:02,040
We're leaving.

274
00:18:02,550 --> 00:18:02,920
Bye.

275
00:18:10,310 --> 00:18:10,960
That's

276
00:18:11,610 --> 00:18:12,810
the girl in the photo?

277
00:18:16,310 --> 00:18:17,910
You're upset because of her?

278
00:18:18,830 --> 00:18:19,720
No.

279
00:18:20,440 --> 00:18:22,830
You want to know what their relationship is?

280
00:18:22,830 --> 00:18:24,160
I'll go ask them for you.

281
00:18:24,610 --> 00:18:26,540
Why are you disturbing their date?

282
00:18:32,310 --> 00:18:33,030
What are you thinking?

283
00:18:33,030 --> 00:18:33,790
Sister Corn.

284
00:18:35,030 --> 00:18:36,030
Don't call me that.

285
00:18:36,030 --> 00:18:37,550
I'm only two months older than you.

286
00:18:37,550 --> 00:18:38,750
It sounds awkward.

287
00:18:40,680 --> 00:18:42,210
Then what should I call you?

288
00:18:43,070 --> 00:18:44,000
Xi,

289
00:18:44,830 --> 00:18:46,000
Mingxi,

290
00:18:46,590 --> 00:18:47,270
or...

291
00:18:49,350 --> 00:18:49,750
baby?

292
00:18:50,590 --> 00:18:51,640
Do you want to die?

293
00:18:51,640 --> 00:18:53,040
How dare you call me that?

294
00:18:58,250 --> 00:19:02,450
[Close to You]
