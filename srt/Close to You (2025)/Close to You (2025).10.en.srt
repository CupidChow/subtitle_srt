it feels like a single moment like this can heal it all

187
00:12:31,630 --> 00:12:32,630
with just a smile.

188
00:12:50,990 --> 00:12:51,390
Here.

189
00:12:51,420 --> 00:12:52,040
Towel.

190
00:12:52,060 --> 00:12:53,000
Dry off a bit first.

191
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:54,640
Why did you have to get off halfway?

192
00:12:54,640 --> 00:12:56,120
Who asked you to follow me?

193
00:12:56,910 --> 00:12:58,670
I'm just worried about you.

194
00:13:15,550 --> 00:13:17,070
Change out of your wet clothes.

195
00:13:17,070 --> 00:13:18,630
These are some old pajamas I have lying around.

196
00:13:18,630 --> 00:13:19,470
Just make do.

197
00:13:19,880 --> 00:13:21,610
I'll wash your clothes for you.

198
00:13:28,120 --> 00:13:28,850
Jiang Bohan.

199
00:13:29,290 --> 00:13:30,690
The toilet is over there.

200
00:13:31,270 --> 00:13:32,000
I know.

201
00:13:35,940 --> 00:13:36,540
Go.

202
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:51,030
Whose clothes

203
00:13:53,360 --> 00:13:54,080
are these?

204
00:13:55,360 --> 00:13:56,000
My dad's.

205
00:13:57,360 --> 00:13:59,670
It's inappropriate for me to wear his clothes.

206
00:13:59,670 --> 00:14:01,200
What if he still wants them?

207
00:14:01,740 --> 00:14:03,270
He can't wear them anymore.

208
00:14:03,630 --> 00:14:04,720
After my dad left,

209
00:14:05,210 --> 00:14:06,320
my mom was angry with him

210
00:14:06,320 --> 00:14:07,690
and threw out all his stuff

211
00:14:07,690 --> 00:14:09,150
except this one outfit.

212
00:14:19,930 --> 00:14:20,740
I'm sorry.

213
00:14:28,120 --> 00:14:28,760
It's okay.

214
00:14:29,200 --> 00:14:29,870
It's been

215
00:14:29,980 --> 00:14:30,910
over a year now.

216
00:14:31,150 --> 00:14:31,870
Look.

217
00:14:32,190 --> 00:14:33,950
I'm doing just fine now.

218
00:14:42,920 --> 00:14:43,520
By the way,

219
00:14:43,690 --> 00:14:46,060
do you mean what you said in the car?

220
00:14:47,400 --> 00:14:48,060
Which part?

221
00:14:48,600 --> 00:14:49,510
You said

222
00:14:49,530 --> 00:14:51,390
you wanted to do something for me.

223
00:14:52,480 --> 00:14:53,080
Of course.

224
00:14:54,080 --> 00:14:54,670
Then,

225
00:14:55,150 --> 00:14:56,550
can you teach me English?

226
00:14:59,800 --> 00:15:01,600
Let's start with this sentence.

227
00:15:01,930 --> 00:15:04,840
When I stand before thee at the day's end,

228
00:15:05,800 --> 00:15:10,200
thou shalt see my scars and know that I had my wounds —

229
00:15:10,230 --> 00:15:11,560
and also my healing.

230
00:15:12,900 --> 00:15:13,960
What does it mean?

231
00:15:15,080 --> 00:15:16,220
It means,

232
00:15:16,950 --> 00:15:18,150
when my days are over,

233
00:15:19,850 --> 00:15:21,480
and I stand before you,

234
00:15:23,990 --> 00:15:25,540
you will see my scars.

235
00:15:26,940 --> 00:15:28,630
You will know I was once hurt,

236
00:15:30,600 --> 00:15:31,800
and recovered.

237
00:15:33,930 --> 00:15:35,260
It's written by Tagore.

238
00:15:39,200 --> 00:15:39,910
Yu Mingxi.

239
00:15:40,170 --> 00:15:41,300
Starting tomorrow,

240
00:15:41,430 --> 00:15:42,670
I'll be your teacher.

241
00:16:28,630 --> 00:16:29,490
This question,

242
00:16:31,110 --> 00:16:34,170
you can solve it by using the formula from this morning.

243
00:16:34,230 --> 00:16:36,610
The formula from this morning?

244
00:16:37,580 --> 00:16:38,790
Are you a fish?

245
00:16:38,810 --> 00:16:39,690
Have you forgotten already?

246
00:16:39,690 --> 00:16:41,750
Don’t dish it out if you can’t take it.

247
00:16:44,080 --> 00:16:44,910
