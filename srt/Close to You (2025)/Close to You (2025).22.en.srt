it's just like that, isn't it?

189
00:11:22,100 --> 00:11:22,730
Qin Siyao!

190
00:11:22,790 --> 00:11:24,120
Why’d you throw my cake?

191
00:11:24,840 --> 00:11:25,360
Cake?

192
00:11:25,950 --> 00:11:26,620
I'm sorry,

193
00:11:26,770 --> 00:11:28,030
I thought it was trash.

194
00:11:28,150 --> 00:11:29,350
You did it on purpose.

195
00:11:30,240 --> 00:11:31,030
Don't bother.

196
00:11:31,030 --> 00:11:33,480
Jiang Bohan doesn't like these little tricks.

197
00:11:33,480 --> 00:11:35,480
What nonsense are you talking about?

198
00:11:35,480 --> 00:11:36,670
It's just a cake, isn't it?

199
00:11:36,670 --> 00:11:37,320
How much was it?

200
00:11:37,320 --> 00:11:38,840
I'll compensate you later.

201
00:11:38,840 --> 00:11:39,370
Don't go.

202
00:11:39,470 --> 00:11:40,170
Explain yourself clearly.

203
00:11:40,170 --> 00:11:41,700
I have nothing to say to you.

204
00:11:48,410 --> 00:11:49,670
Yu Mingxi, you savage!

205
00:11:54,030 --> 00:11:56,090
Qin Siyao, you've provoked me today.

206
00:12:00,910 --> 00:12:01,720
Yu Mingxi!

207
00:12:06,780 --> 00:12:07,380
Let go!

208
00:12:16,410 --> 00:12:17,180
Let go!

209
00:12:17,760 --> 00:12:18,500
You let go first!

210
00:12:18,500 --> 00:12:19,560
What are you doing?

211
00:12:19,860 --> 00:12:20,650
Let go!

212
00:12:22,170 --> 00:12:22,900
Jiang Bohan!

213
00:12:23,040 --> 00:12:24,090
Yu Mingxi hit me!

214
00:12:24,120 --> 00:12:25,850
You just can't keep up the act anymore, can you?

215
00:12:25,850 --> 00:12:26,670
What act are you talking about?

216
00:12:26,670 --> 00:12:27,910
You threw my cake first,

217
00:12:27,910 --> 00:12:28,790
and pushed me!

218
00:12:28,790 --> 00:12:29,390
Pay me back for the cake!

219
00:12:29,390 --> 00:12:30,240
You need to compensate me for my bracelet!

220
00:12:30,240 --> 00:12:31,910
Can you even afford to compensate me?

221
00:12:31,910 --> 00:12:32,440
Alright!

222
00:12:32,510 --> 00:12:33,270
I'll pay for it.

223
00:12:33,270 --> 00:12:34,870
You pay me for the cake first!

224
00:12:35,570 --> 00:12:36,130
Here you go.

225
00:12:36,130 --> 00:12:37,030
Just string it back together.

226
00:12:37,030 --> 00:12:38,510
How can it be the same after stringing it back together?

227
00:12:38,510 --> 00:12:40,570
You compensate me for the cake first!

228
00:12:40,670 --> 00:12:41,270
Fine.

229
00:12:41,390 --> 00:12:42,200
You're trying to extort money from me, aren't you?

230
00:12:42,200 --> 00:12:42,670
How much?

231
00:12:42,670 --> 00:12:43,640
I'll compensate you.

232
00:12:43,640 --> 00:12:44,630
I made that myself.

233
00:12:44,630 --> 00:12:46,360
You compensate me with an identical one!

234
00:12:46,360 --> 00:12:48,030
If you made it, it’s even more worthless!

235
00:12:48,030 --> 00:12:48,720
Who are you calling worthless?

236
00:12:48,720 --> 00:12:49,790
I’m calling you worthless!

237
00:12:49,790 --> 00:12:50,850
You're worthless!

238
00:12:51,390 --> 00:12:51,750
You!

239
00:12:52,030 --> 00:12:53,090
You're worthless!

240
00:12:53,240 --> 00:12:54,270
Jiang Bohan, let me go!

241
00:12:54,270 --> 00:12:54,910
Let go!

242
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:56,020
You're worthless!

243
00:12:56,020 --> 00:12:57,090
Don't pull me!

244
00:13:00,710 --> 00:13:01,370
Here you go.

245
00:13:07,670 --> 00:13:08,750
You’re going too far.

246
00:13:08,750 --> 00:13:10,670
I picked it up for you out of kindness.

247
00:13:10,670 --> 00:13:12,200
It's none of your business.

248
00:13:12,910 --> 00:13:14,580
Mingxi made that cake for me.

249
00:13:14,670 --> 00:13:16,130
It wasn't for Jiang Bohan.

250
00:13:16,510 --> 00:13:18,750
The more you play these little tricks,

251
00:13:18,830 --> 00:13:20,490
the closer those two will get.

252
00:13:21,800 --> 00:13:22,930
What about you then?

253
00:13:22,960 --> 00:13:24,870
Always hanging around the basketball team,

254
00:13:24,870 --> 00:13:25,800
clinging to him.

255
00:13:25,970 --> 00:13:27,700
You think you're not annoying?

256
00:13:28,750 --> 00:13:30,750
Aren't you always hovering around Jiang Bohan too?

257
00:13:30,750 --> 00:13:31,870
What right do you have to criticize me?

258
00:13:31,870 --> 00:13:33,380
At least I have more right than you do.

259
00:13:33,380 --> 00:13:33,980
Qin Siyao,

260
00:13:34,630 --> 00:13:36,170
you don't need to take it out on her.

261
00:13:36,170 --> 00:13:37,100
I'm not leaving.

262
00:13:37,820 --> 00:13:38,960
Your temper is so bad,

263
00:13:38,960 --> 00:13:39,730
and your tongue is so sharp.

264
00:13:39,730 --> 00:13:41,190
You're way more annoying.

265
00:13:41,280 --> 00:13:43,140
Stop acting like you’re all that.

266
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:45,330
Your dancing is so poor,

267
00:13:45,360 --> 00:13:46,880
and your body's out of shape.

268
00:13:46,880 --> 00:13:48,430
You still dare to eat cake?

269
00:13:49,070 --> 00:13:51,930
I've never seen such a thick-skinned girl like you.

270
00:13:52,150 --> 00:13:53,550
Every day, apart from acting cute and being boy-crazy,

271
00:13:53,550 --> 00:13:54,680
what else can you do?

272
00:13:55,090 --> 00:13:56,490
No one will ever like you.

273
00:13:56,510 --> 00:13:57,270
Qin Siyao.

274
00:13:58,510 --> 00:13:59,440
Don't go too far.

275
00:14:06,750 --> 00:14:07,480
Are you okay?

276
00:14:10,400 --> 00:14:11,090
It's alright.

277
00:14:11,090 --> 00:14:12,290
It's fine, it's fine.

278
00:14:19,360 --> 00:14:21,420
Jiang Bohan, where are you taking me?

279
00:14:24,200 --> 00:14:24,860
Let go!

280
00:14:25,800 --> 00:14:26,840
It's not my fault.

281
00:14:26,840 --> 00:14:27,870
Why are you pulling me outside?

282
00:14:27,870 --> 00:14:29,000
If I don't pull you, who should I pull?

283
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:30,360
Should I pull Qin Siyao instead?

284
00:14:30,360 --> 00:14:30,870
Sure.

285
00:14:30,890 --> 00:14:32,690
If you want to pull her, go ahead.

286
00:14:33,150 --> 00:14:34,510
I haven't even settled the score with you yet.

287
00:14:34,510 --> 00:14:36,370
Why are you getting angry with me?

288
00:14:36,750 --> 00:14:38,950
What score do you have to settle with me?

289
00:14:40,720 --> 00:14:43,040
What exactly is your relationship with You Jingchu?

290
00:14:43,040 --> 00:14:45,300
Why is he staying at your place every day?

291
00:14:45,390 --> 00:14:47,120
Didn't I tell you before?

292
00:14:47,440 --> 00:14:49,720
You think you can flirt every day and be attached at the hip

293
00:14:49,720 --> 00:14:50,620
under the guise of being siblings?

294
00:14:50,620 --> 00:14:51,810
We're not flirting.

295
00:14:51,840 --> 00:14:53,320
Looks like flirting to me!

296
00:14:53,390 --> 00:14:55,390
Jiang Bohan, can you be reasonable?

297
00:14:58,200 --> 00:14:58,720
Fine.

298
00:14:58,920 --> 00:15:00,440
I'll talk reason.

299
00:15:00,960 --> 00:15:02,200
He drives you everywhere,

300
00:15:02,200 --> 00:15:03,350
and you have couple toothbrushes.

301
00:15:03,350 --> 00:15:05,950
Do you think I'm happy seeing you together every day?

302
00:15:05,950 --> 00:15:08,000
I didn’t tell you because I didn’t want to pressure you,

303
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:09,390
not because I don't care about you.

304
00:15:09,390 --> 00:15:10,790
The injury on your leg...

305
00:15:19,840 --> 00:15:21,770
Yu Mingxi, explain yourself to me.

306
00:15:23,200 --> 00:15:25,130
What exactly is our relationship?

307
00:15:28,530 --> 00:15:29,290
The two of us...

308
00:15:29,290 --> 00:15:31,550
What kind of relationship could we have?

309
00:15:33,630 --> 00:15:35,230
You don't want to say it, huh?

310
00:15:36,500 --> 00:15:37,100
Forget it.

311
00:15:37,710 --> 00:15:38,910
I'm tired of chasing.

312
00:15:39,160 --> 00:15:44,450

This is...

326
00:16:51,910 --> 00:16:52,910
Probably,

327
00:16:53,200 --> 00:16:54,460
when You Jingchu left,

328
00:16:54,630 --> 00:16:55,240
he was in a hurry,

329
00:16:55,240 --> 00:16:55,600
so he

330
00:16:55,980 --> 00:16:56,910
made such a mess.

331
00:16:58,080 --> 00:16:58,680
It's okay.

332
00:17:02,510 --> 00:17:04,109
He's quite tidy, huh?

333
00:17:08,599 --> 00:17:09,460
Where did he go?

334
00:17:10,829 --> 00:17:11,440
He...

335
00:17:11,589 --> 00:17:13,190
went to play in a tournament.

336
00:17:13,480 --> 00:17:15,810
He’ll probably be back in a couple of days.

337
00:17:25,430 --> 00:17:26,510
Why’s the power out?

338
00:17:26,510 --> 00:17:27,339
It's an old house.

339
00:17:27,339 --> 00:17:28,740
It'll be fine in a moment.

340
00:17:30,950 --> 00:17:31,350
Right!

341
00:17:31,570 --> 00:17:32,500
Hold on a second.

342
00:17:43,480 --> 00:17:45,890
The cake you gave to Wang Chunian today,

343
00:17:47,240 --> 00:17:48,440
you made it yourself?

344
00:17:50,220 --> 00:17:50,750
Yeah.

345
00:17:50,920 --> 00:17:53,120
She wanted to eat it, so I made it for her.

346
00:17:54,080 --> 00:17:54,950
However,

347
00:17:54,980 --> 00:17:56,000
it doesn't look very appetizing.

348
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:57,200
I hope you don't mind.

349
00:17:57,200 --> 00:17:58,200
Why would I mind?

350
00:18:03,510 --> 00:18:04,440
It's delicious.

351
00:18:04,690 --> 00:18:05,290
Come here.

00:18:27,190 --> 00:18:31,390
