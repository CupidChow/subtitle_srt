You just won't leave me alone, will you?

00:00:21,830 --> 00:00:22,430
I told you,

3
00:00:22,890 --> 00:00:24,330
I'd beat you up every time I see you,

4
00:00:24,330 --> 00:00:25,330
until you submit.

5
00:00:27,040 --> 00:00:28,970
I didn't expect you, Yan Zhengwen,

6
00:00:29,830 --> 00:00:31,790
to actually keep your word for once.

7
00:00:31,790 --> 00:00:32,920
Cut the crap.

8
00:01:11,520 --> 00:01:12,530
What are you doing?

9
00:01:12,530 --> 00:01:15,000
Why are so many of you ganging up on one person?

10
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:15,590
Kid,

11
00:01:15,840 --> 00:01:17,240
hurry home after school.

12
00:01:17,430 --> 00:01:18,630
Don't look for trouble.

13
00:01:18,630 --> 00:01:19,820
You shouldn't fight.

14
00:01:19,820 --> 00:01:22,220
If you fight again, I'm calling the police.

15
00:01:24,350 --> 00:01:25,610
Are you leaving or not?

16
00:01:25,710 --> 00:01:27,310
If not, we'll beat you up too.

17
00:01:27,890 --> 00:01:28,480

They beat you up.

52
00:04:24,580 --> 00:04:26,040
Why didn't you call the police?

53
00:04:26,040 --> 00:04:26,640
Forget it.

54
00:04:27,120 --> 00:04:28,120
I fought back too.

55
00:04:28,520 --> 00:04:29,830
What will you do next time?

56
00:04:29,830 --> 00:04:30,390
Without me,

57
00:04:30,390 --> 00:04:31,790
you might not be so lucky.

58
00:04:33,390 --> 00:04:35,450
Yan Zhengwen won't do anything to me.

Oh, you know each other?

I guess so.

61
00:04:39,110 --> 00:04:40,310
Then you should have a good talk.

62
00:04:40,310 --> 00:04:41,640
You can't always fight.

63
00:04:42,790 --> 00:04:44,250
You seem quite concerned.

64
00:04:44,830 --> 00:04:45,750
No matter what,

65
00:04:45,880 --> 00:04:48,210
you should go straight home after school.

66
00:04:48,240 --> 00:04:50,100
Hasn't your mother told you that?

67
00:04:50,800 --> 00:04:51,400
Thank you.

68

My mom...

69
00:04:52,830 --> 00:04:54,630
She actually never told me that.

you were hurt pretty badly just now.

00:04:57,800 --> 00:04:58,920
Do you want to go to the hospital?

74
00:04:58,920 --> 00:04:59,380
No need.

75
00:04:59,760 --> 00:05:01,560
It'll be fine in a couple of days.

76
00:05:01,560 --> 00:05:03,510
But you took that hit for me.

77
00:05:06,120 --> 00:05:06,920
It's nothing.

78
00:05:07,360 --> 00:05:08,600

81
00:05:10,430 --> 00:05:11,690
No need to feel guilty.

82
00:05:11,720 --> 00:05:12,510
What loss?

83
00:05:13,040 --> 00:05:15,040
Didn't you throw away your food too?

84
00:05:15,100 --> 00:05:16,760

I feel a surge in my heart.

98

204
00:10:57,320 --> 00:10:58,320
you just go for it.

205
00:10:58,670 --> 00:10:59,600
I'm a bit afraid.

Are they going to give our captain another love letter?

213
00:11:09,630 --> 00:11:11,120
There are too many people at the school gate today.

214

How could you blow such a great opportunity?

238

I underestimated the situation before.

239
00:12:07,670 --> 00:12:08,730
In that situation,

240
00:12:08,750 --> 00:12:10,150
you should just go for it.

241
00:12:10,510 --> 00:12:11,960
The worst that could happen is he rejects you.

I think you're right.

251
00:12:26,600 --> 00:12:29,000
Using stickers on a love letter isn't good.

252

Could you help me write another one?

253
00:12:34,440 --> 00:12:35,910
I've already given you the content.

Three of the students were allegedly beaten by civilians.

00:17:20,160 --> 00:17:21,960
we shouldn't waste food, right?

383
00:17:22,400 --> 00:17:23,329
Keep it a secret.

384
00:17:24,089 --> 00:17:24,920
Goodbye, Manager.

385
00:17:24,920 --> 00:17:25,579
Go home now.

386
00:17:30,880 --> 00:17:31,740
We finally won.

387
00:17:31,960 --> 00:17:34,090
Where should we go to celebrate later?

388
00:17:35,060 --> 00:17:37,520
A three-point narrow victory is still a win?

389
00:17:37,960 --> 00:17:38,920
Keep practicing.

390
00:17:38,920 --> 00:17:39,450
Captain,

391
00:17:39,960 --> 00:17:42,240
we just finished the game, don't we get a break?

392
00:17:42,240 --> 00:17:43,100
I'm a bit tired.

393
00:17:43,640 --> 00:17:44,830
If you're tired and thirsty,

394
00:17:44,830 --> 00:17:46,170
there's a new promotion at the convenience store.

395
00:17:46,170 --> 00:17:48,100
Buy one get one free on cold drinks.

396
00:17:54,810 --> 00:17:55,310
No need.

397
00:17:55,310 --> 00:17:55,910
Thank you.

398
00:17:57,470 --> 00:17:58,620
How about I take one?

399
00:17:58,810 --> 00:17:59,610
I said no need.

400
00:18:01,700 --> 00:18:04,560
How do you know if you need it or not without looking?

401
00:18:08,040 --> 00:18:09,210
We need to start training.

402
00:18:09,210 --> 00:18:09,930
Why don't you

403
00:18:09,930 --> 00:18:10,790
go wait on the side for a while?

404
00:18:10,790 --> 00:18:12,650
I'm afraid the ball might hit you.

405
00:18:14,250 --> 00:18:15,100
Wang Chunian,

406
00:18:15,580 --> 00:18:16,200
come back.

407
00:18:17,060 --> 00:18:17,880
Come back.

408
00:18:18,200 --> 00:18:19,110
I told you so.

409
00:18:19,110 --> 00:18:19,960
Watch out!

410
00:18:23,680 --> 00:18:24,280
Watch out!

411
00:18:37,570 --> 00:18:41,510
[Close to You]
