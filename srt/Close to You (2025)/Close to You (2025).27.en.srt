Come on.

2
00:00:09,500 --> 00:00:11,560
Time-out over, and the game resumes.

3
00:00:16,790 --> 00:00:17,630
Jingcai!

4
00:00:17,800 --> 00:00:18,710
Let's go!

5
00:00:25,390 --> 00:00:27,640
Jingcai makes the throw-in from the sideline.

6
00:00:27,640 --> 00:00:29,240
The ball goes to Jiang Bohan.

7
00:00:29,600 --> 00:00:31,800
Jiang Bohan drives down the right side.

8
00:00:31,910 --> 00:00:33,380
Double-team coming in.

9
00:00:33,660 --> 00:00:36,520
He passes to the weak side—Chen Sujie with the shot!

10
00:00:44,440 --> 00:00:46,030
Jingcai has tied the score!

11
00:00:46,580 --> 00:00:49,830
And they have a chance to win the game
with a free throw!

12
00:00:51,650 --> 00:00:53,300
Nanli commits a hand-check foul.

13
00:00:53,300 --> 00:00:55,190
Jingcai gets a free throw.

14
00:00:55,560 --> 00:00:56,520
This shot could secure the victory!

15
00:00:56,520 --> 00:00:57,850
But can Chen Sujie do it?

16
00:00:58,430 --> 00:00:59,840
He's already so badly injured!

17
00:00:59,840 --> 00:01:03,110
-Game-winner!
-Game-winner!

18
00:01:04,019 --> 00:01:05,019
Don't be nervous.

19
00:01:06,420 --> 00:01:07,070
Relax.

20
00:01:09,990 --> 00:01:11,260
Show your true level.

21
00:01:11,280 --> 00:01:12,210
You've got this.

00:01:22,120 --> 00:01:23,050
I believe in you.

23
00:02:09,970 --> 00:02:12,670

of gleaming steel,

00:02:12,670 --> 00:02:16,530
I would, drunk with might, cleave the sky
and bring down the rainbow!"

25
00:02:16,780 --> 00:02:19,380
At this moment, they rewrote team history

26
00:02:19,400 --> 00:02:21,010
and found redemption.

27
00:02:21,560 --> 00:02:24,360
Only by facing challenges head-on with courage

28
00:02:24,380 --> 00:02:26,350
can one gain the favor of destiny.

How far does she have left?

34
00:02:47,280 --> 00:02:48,560
You Jingchu said we can make it.

35
00:02:48,560 --> 00:02:49,470

You've got this!

00:03:22,250 --> 00:03:24,980
That 20 km split was 30 seconds faster than usual.

52
00:03:25,430 --> 00:03:26,960
Just a little more, Yu Mingxi!

53
00:03:26,960 --> 00:03:28,760
Already one minute and forty-five seconds faster!

I'm starving.

Aren't those two in the honeymoon phase?

Sorry,

Really?

81
00:06:33,800 --> 00:06:34,670
Do you want this?

82
00:06:34,670 --> 00:06:35,000
Yes.

83
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:38,159
How did Captain and Yu Mingxi get together?

84
00:06:38,720 --> 00:06:40,630
Was it because of that love letter?

85
00:06:40,630 --> 00:06:41,690
Well, in that case,

86
00:06:41,920 --> 00:06:43,650
I was their number one wingman.

87
00:06:44,600 --> 00:06:45,680
Well, in that case,

88
00:06:46,320 --> 00:06:48,720
you also wrote a love letter to Jiang Bohan?

89
00:06:50,350 --> 00:06:51,680
That's all in the past.

90
00:06:53,070 --> 00:06:54,070
That's not right.

91
00:06:54,430 --> 00:06:56,280
I think it was earlier than the love letter.

92
00:06:56,280 --> 00:06:57,340
Earlier than that?

93
00:06:57,600 --> 00:06:58,720
Then when was it?

94
00:06:59,480 --> 00:07:01,240
They first met at a barbershop.

95
00:07:01,260 --> 00:07:03,320
It must have been love at first sight.

96
00:07:04,560 --> 00:07:05,360

He's basically her brother.

106
00:07:20,510 --> 00:07:21,120
He must know

107
00:07:21,120 --> 00:07:23,120
when Yu Mingxi started liking Captain.

108
00:07:23,120 --> 00:07:24,250

180
00:09:59,770 --> 00:10:01,430
I've had the lawyer review the contract.

181
00:10:01,430 --> 00:10:02,960
Everything looks good now.

182
00:10:03,030 --> 00:10:04,830
But you need to think it through.

183
00:10:05,050 --> 00:10:06,850
This is a four-year commitment.

184
00:10:07,210 --> 00:10:09,300
Once you sign, there's no backing out.

185
00:10:09,300 --> 00:10:10,420
If you breach the contract,

186
00:10:10,420 --> 00:10:13,680
the team won't be able to compromise
on the penalty clause.

187
00:10:23,790 --> 00:10:25,590
The team's been pushing so hard.

188
00:10:25,680 --> 00:10:27,480
I need to notify them right away.

189
00:10:38,530 --> 00:10:39,240
I signed it.

190
00:10:41,320 --> 00:10:42,120
That's great.

191
00:10:42,450 --> 00:10:43,510
Congratulations!

192
00:10:46,840 --> 00:10:48,970
I'll take you to meet someone tonight.

193
00:10:50,360 --> 00:10:51,840
Who is it? So mysterious.

194
00:10:52,150 --> 00:10:53,750
You'll see when we get there.

195
00:10:53,790 --> 00:10:55,480
It's someone who's very important to me.

196
00:10:55,480 --> 00:10:55,970
Okay.

197
00:10:56,030 --> 00:10:57,750
I still have an hour before I get off work.

198
00:10:57,750 --> 00:10:58,950
I'll come pick you up.

199
00:11:08,580 --> 00:11:10,910
How's it going? Did you sign the contract?

200
00:11:11,300 --> 00:11:12,210
Just signed it.

201
00:11:13,960 --> 00:11:14,670
What are you doing?

202
00:11:14,670 --> 00:11:16,270
Why is it so noisy over there?

203
00:11:16,600 --> 00:11:19,120
Today's the last round of UCLA's admission interviews.

204
00:11:19,120 --> 00:11:20,080
I've come to help.

205
00:11:20,080 --> 00:11:22,010
We need to meet all the applicants.

206
00:11:26,240 --> 00:11:27,770
Wait, what did you just say?

207
00:11:28,550 --> 00:11:30,300
I said I'm doing interviews.

208
00:11:30,360 --> 00:11:31,440
There's half an hour left.

209
00:11:31,440 --> 00:11:32,910
I'll come find you when it's over.

210
00:11:32,910 --> 00:11:33,570
I have to go.

211
00:11:33,630 --> 00:11:34,020
I'm hanging up.

212
00:11:34,020 --> 00:11:34,560
Bye-bye.

213
00:12:01,170 --> 00:12:02,320
I'm at work right now.

214
00:12:02,320 --> 00:12:03,550
It's not convenient to take calls.

215
00:12:03,550 --> 00:12:04,350
What's wrong?

216
00:12:05,600 --> 00:12:07,660
What time did your shift start today?

217
00:12:08,030 --> 00:12:08,910
I'm on the early shift today.

218
00:12:08,910 --> 00:12:10,510
Of course, it started at 8 AM.

219
00:12:10,840 --> 00:12:12,570
Didn't you go to the interview?

220
00:12:13,790 --> 00:12:15,120
Wait for me at the store.

221
00:12:15,280 --> 00:12:16,410
I'm coming over now.

222
00:12:20,890 --> 00:12:23,090
Why does Jiang Bohan sound a little off?

223
00:12:24,020 --> 00:12:24,850
Oh no,

224
00:12:25,040 --> 00:12:27,100
he couldn't have found out, could he?

225
00:12:38,210 --> 00:12:39,480
Did you know all along

226
00:12:39,480 --> 00:12:41,910
that Yu Mingxi didn't apply to UCLA?

227
00:12:48,870 --> 00:12:50,000
Where are you going?

228
00:12:50,130 --> 00:12:54,190
Today is Boyang's death anniversary.
We have to go visit his grave later.

229
00:12:56,010 --> 00:12:56,910
What's the matter, Corn?

230
00:12:56,910 --> 00:12:58,060
Why are we running?

231
00:13:04,510 --> 00:13:05,440
What's going on?

232
00:13:14,390 --> 00:13:15,150
Yu Mingxi!

233
00:13:17,840 --> 00:13:18,320
Yu Mingxi!

234
00:13:18,320 --> 00:13:19,050
Jiang Bohan!

235
00:13:20,500 --> 00:13:21,240
Yu Mingxi!

236
00:13:21,240 --> 00:13:22,320
Explain yourself!

237
00:13:49,140 --> 00:13:50,800
What's wrong with you two now?

238
00:13:51,120 --> 00:13:52,180
Don't ask anymore.

239
00:13:53,790 --> 00:13:55,480
Why can't you just talk to him?

240
00:13:56,750 --> 00:13:58,910
You can't keep hiding from him forever, right?

241
00:13:58,910 --> 00:14:00,100
I lied to him.

242
00:14:02,250 --> 00:14:03,560
He won't forgive me.

243
00:14:12,530 --> 00:14:13,480
Yu Mingxi!

244
00:14:14,330 --> 00:14:15,330
Yu Mingxi.

245
00:14:17,820 --> 00:14:18,480
If you don't go,

246
00:14:18,480 --> 00:14:19,740
then I won't go either.

247
00:14:21,120 --> 00:14:21,790
Yu Mingxi.

248
00:14:24,120 --> 00:14:25,380
I know you're in there.

249
00:14:27,480 --> 00:14:28,940
I'll wait for you outside.

250
00:14:30,820 --> 00:14:32,420
I'll wait until you come out.

251
00:15:09,550 --> 00:15:10,610
It's already late.

252
00:15:11,120 --> 00:15:13,320
Why don't you go outside and talk to him?

253
00:15:15,540 --> 00:15:16,800
He's stubborn as hell.

254
00:15:17,550 --> 00:15:18,670
If you don't go out,

255
00:15:19,840 --> 00:15:21,370
he definitely won't leave.

256
00:15:54,200 --> 00:15:55,460
Corn is not coming out.

257
00:15:57,000 --> 00:15:57,800
You should go.

258
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:00,550
Go back.

259
00:16:01,530 --> 00:16:02,170
It's so late.

260
00:16:02,170 --> 00:16:02,840
Go home.

261
00:16:08,390 --> 00:16:10,720
Since when can you make decisions for her?

262
00:16:14,790 --> 00:16:17,120
I don't think I made myself clear just now.

263
00:16:17,870 --> 00:16:18,790
What I mean is,

264
00:16:19,980 --> 00:16:21,360
stop bothering her.

265
00:16:21,840 --> 00:16:22,510
Get lost.

266
00:16:28,150 --> 00:16:28,750
Do it.

267
00:16:30,320 --> 00:16:31,320
If hitting me

268
00:16:32,120 --> 00:16:33,850
will make you stop blaming her,

269
00:16:34,670 --> 00:16:36,200
then go ahead and continue.

270
00:16:56,750 --> 00:16:57,790
I promised my dad

271
00:16:58,320 --> 00:16:59,850
I'd go out and see the world.

272
00:17:01,120 --> 00:17:01,850
Jiang Bohan,

273
00:17:02,240 --> 00:17:03,700
let's go abroad together.

274
00:17:05,680 --> 00:17:07,480
Then, let's work hard together.

275
00:17:12,290 --> 00:17:14,020
How's your application going?

276
00:17:14,400 --> 00:17:17,000
Have you submitted your language test scores?

277
00:17:29,400 --> 00:17:31,880
I've... never been good at pretending.

278
00:17:32,120 --> 00:17:34,720
The look of love in one's eyes cannot be hidden.

279
00:17:44,350 --> 00:17:45,570
Just make a wish.

280
00:17:47,310 --> 00:17:47,840
Alright.

281
00:17:48,180 --> 00:17:50,380
Then I'll share half of my wish with you.

282
00:17:50,800 --> 00:17:51,320
Really?

283
00:17:52,790 --> 00:17:54,070
I read a book recently.

284
00:17:54,880 --> 00:17:55,750
It said,

285
00:17:56,720 --> 00:17:58,270
"The most honest way to live

286
00:17:58,270 --> 00:18:00,930
is to follow what your heart and body truly want.

287
00:18:01,210 --> 00:18:02,770
Eat when you're hungry,

288
00:18:03,600 --> 00:18:06,320
and don't lie when you're in love."

289
00:18:08,090 --> 00:18:09,090
What do you think?

290
00:18:12,100 --> 00:18:14,100
I think that's pretty well written.

291
00:18:34,490 --> 00:18:38,530
[Close to You]
