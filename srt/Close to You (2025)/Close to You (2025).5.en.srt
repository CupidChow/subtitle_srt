1
00:00:09,030 --> 00:00:10,030
Then give it a try.

2
00:00:36,010 --> 00:00:37,140
You saw everything.

3
00:00:40,200 --> 00:00:40,790
Saw what?

4
00:00:41,100 --> 00:00:41,960
I just got here.

5
00:00:42,980 --> 00:00:44,240
Why did it take so long?

6
00:00:44,470 --> 00:00:46,400
I've been waiting for you for ages.

7
00:00:46,450 --> 00:00:47,580
Where are you going?

8
00:00:48,390 --> 00:00:48,880
Home.

9
00:00:51,670 --> 00:00:52,730
You must be hungry.

10
00:00:53,380 --> 00:00:55,380
I'll take you somewhere nice to eat.

11
00:01:54,009 --> 00:01:56,990
[Close to You]

12
00:01:57,009 --> 00:01:59,440
[Episode 5, Keep a distance]

13
00:02:03,640 --> 00:02:04,120
Nian!

14
00:02:07,120 --> 00:02:08,250
You're pretty fast.

15
00:02:08,910 --> 00:02:10,840
Thanks for covering my shift yesterday.

16
00:02:10,840 --> 00:02:11,770
It's no big deal.

17
00:02:12,120 --> 00:02:12,840
I just wanted to see

18
00:02:12,840 --> 00:02:14,080
what working part-time feels like.

19
00:02:14,080 --> 00:02:16,079
Turns out making money is kinda fun.

20
00:02:16,829 --> 00:02:17,430
By the way,

21
00:02:18,079 --> 00:02:19,410
where's my red bean bun?

22
00:02:21,350 --> 00:02:21,760
Wait.

23
00:02:22,030 --> 00:02:24,290
Are you sure it won't upset your stomach?

24
00:02:24,400 --> 00:02:25,730
It just barely expired.

25
00:02:25,800 --> 00:02:27,060
I'm not that delicate.

26
00:02:27,270 --> 00:02:27,870
Besides,

27
00:02:28,050 --> 00:02:30,450
this way you won't forget to eat breakfast.

28
00:02:34,040 --> 00:02:34,920
After school,

29
00:02:35,230 --> 00:02:37,190
I'll go with you to tear down those flyers.

30
00:02:37,190 --> 00:02:37,680
Okay.

31
00:02:44,829 --> 00:02:46,510
About you and Jiang Bohan...

32
00:02:46,540 --> 00:02:48,220
I'm afraid I can't help you with that.

33
00:02:48,220 --> 00:02:49,180
It's okay.

34
00:02:49,270 --> 00:02:50,870
I still have Lin Shaoyang,

35
00:02:50,910 --> 00:02:51,800
Chen Sujie,

36
00:02:51,800 --> 00:02:53,000
and He Shuhao anyway.

37
00:02:53,030 --> 00:02:54,079
Fine.

38
00:02:54,079 --> 00:02:56,079
The whole basketball team is yours.

39
00:02:56,840 --> 00:02:57,640
Oh, by the way,

40
00:02:57,870 --> 00:02:59,329
I have a secret to tell you.

41
00:02:59,470 --> 00:03:00,080
What is it?

42
00:03:01,590 --> 00:03:04,000
Jiang Bohan is actually Headmaster's son.

43
00:03:04,280 --> 00:03:05,080
What?

44
00:03:05,290 --> 00:03:06,190
The Headmaster is actually

45
00:03:06,190 --> 00:03:07,450
Jiang Bohan's mother?

46
00:03:11,940 --> 00:03:13,050
It's inappropriate

47
00:03:13,050 --> 00:03:14,840
to tell his secrets to others

48
00:03:16,590 --> 00:03:17,990
without his permission.

49
00:03:24,470 --> 00:03:24,960
Wait,

50
00:03:26,520 --> 00:03:27,140
Jiang Bohan,

51
00:03:27,140 --> 00:03:27,790
I'm sorry.

52
00:03:30,320 --> 00:03:31,450
And your clothes...

53
00:03:32,030 --> 00:03:32,520
Keep it.

54
00:03:33,180 --> 00:03:33,850
Why?

55
00:03:35,040 --> 00:03:35,880
I'm giving it to you.

56
00:03:35,880 --> 00:03:36,230
But

57
00:03:36,250 --> 00:03:37,500
it's expensive.

58
00:03:39,320 --> 00:03:40,740
Jiang Bohan has already turned you down;

59
00:03:40,740 --> 00:03:42,540
why are you still pestering him?

60
00:03:42,829 --> 00:03:44,710
Troublemakers really are full of tricks.

61
00:03:44,710 --> 00:03:45,660
Jiang Bohan would never

62
00:03:45,660 --> 00:03:47,590
fall for your cheap little tricks.

63
00:03:47,950 --> 00:03:49,420
You really think just because he stood up for you once,

64
00:03:49,420 --> 00:03:50,750
you two are friends now?

65
00:03:51,050 --> 00:03:53,510
Have you never taken a good look at yourself?

66
00:03:57,030 --> 00:03:58,150
How annoying.

67
00:03:59,280 --> 00:04:00,880
What's going on with you two?

68
00:04:01,120 --> 00:04:01,680
Yesterday, he

69
00:04:01,680 --> 00:04:03,880
defended you in front of so many people.

70
00:04:05,030 --> 00:04:06,520
Of all people to mess with,

71
00:04:06,560 --> 00:04:08,520
why would you pick Headmaster's son?

72
00:04:08,520 --> 00:04:10,680
He is so low-key.

73
00:04:12,030 --> 00:04:13,310
He's really nice.

74
00:04:32,040 --> 00:04:32,830
Mingxi,

75
00:04:33,390 --> 00:04:35,720
can you help me write another love letter?

76
00:04:36,070 --> 00:04:37,000
To whom?

77
00:04:37,480 --> 00:04:39,540
Don't tell me it's still Jiang Bohan.

78
00:04:39,630 --> 00:04:40,120
No.

79
00:04:40,550 --> 00:04:42,130
I need to think this through.

80
00:04:42,130 --> 00:04:43,180
With your strict

81
00:04:43,200 --> 00:04:43,940
rating system,

82
00:04:43,940 --> 00:04:45,270
you still need to think?

83
00:04:48,560 --> 00:04:50,270
Those four are super close.

84
00:04:50,800 --> 00:04:52,659
I only get one shot at confessing.

85
00:04:52,950 --> 00:04:54,810
I'm not gonna risk losing all my options

86
00:04:54,810 --> 00:04:56,180
just for one guy.

87
00:05:08,320 --> 00:05:09,640
I've already come up with a strategy.

88
00:05:09,640 --> 00:05:10,080
Go on.

89
00:05:10,120 --> 00:05:11,750
Tomorrow we'll run a pick-and-roll for you,

90
00:05:11,750 --> 00:05:12,800
then you pop out,

91
00:05:12,820 --> 00:05:13,970
take a jump shot, right?

92
00:05:13,970 --> 00:05:15,600
But what if we don't get the rebound?

93
00:05:15,600 --> 00:05:16,000
Right?

94
00:05:16,100 --> 00:05:17,120
If we can't get the rebound,

95
00:05:17,120 --> 00:05:18,580
then we won't have this...

96
00:05:31,020 --> 00:05:32,680
Captain, where are you going?

97
00:05:36,930 --> 00:05:37,990
Captain, sit here.

98
00:05:59,790 --> 00:06:00,230
Hello.

99
00:06:05,490 --> 00:06:06,240
What's with the greeting?

100
00:06:06,240 --> 00:06:07,270
Do you think you're doing well with your training?

101
00:06:07,270 --> 00:06:08,600
I'm heading back first.

102
00:06:09,630 --> 00:06:10,430
Ten push-ups.

103
00:06:11,230 --> 00:06:12,430
Go do them over there!

104
00:06:17,190 --> 00:06:17,830
Mingxi!

105
00:06:18,070 --> 00:06:18,720
Mingxi!

106
00:06:24,860 --> 00:06:25,310
I'm just saying,

107
00:06:25,310 --> 00:06:25,840
Captain,

108
00:06:26,370 --> 00:06:27,390
have we figured out

109
00:06:27,390 --> 00:06:28,610
who posted that love letter yet?

110
00:06:28,610 --> 00:06:29,120
Whoever put it up

111
00:06:29,120 --> 00:06:30,850
should be the one to clean it off, don't you think?

112
00:06:30,850 --> 00:06:31,320
Shut up.

113
00:06:34,800 --> 00:06:36,640
I should have brought some adhesive remover.

114
00:06:36,640 --> 00:06:38,100
This is too hard to remove.

115
00:06:38,800 --> 00:06:39,860
Where's Yu Mingxi?

116
00:06:41,700 --> 00:06:42,230
Captain,

117
00:06:43,510 --> 00:06:45,170
did you two have a falling out?

118
00:06:49,830 --> 00:06:51,159
Just focus on your work.

119
00:06:55,909 --> 00:06:57,440
Why hasn't Jie arrived yet?

120
00:06:57,450 --> 00:06:58,750
He said he had something to do.

121
00:06:58,750 --> 00:06:59,750
He'll come later.

122
00:06:59,830 --> 00:07:02,490
What else could he be doing besides basketball?

123
00:07:03,400 --> 00:07:04,400
He's being all mysterious about it.

124
00:07:04,400 --> 00:07:05,930
Maybe he's dating someone.

125
00:07:10,200 --> 00:07:11,010
Mingxi!

126
00:07:11,040 --> 00:07:11,920
I'm here.

127
00:07:19,940 --> 00:07:20,620
I'm sorry.

128
00:07:21,410 --> 00:07:22,810
I went to the wrong place.

129
00:07:29,740 --> 00:07:33,170
♪ Nobody knows ♪

130
00:07:33,310 --> 00:07:37,170
♪ This feeling I'll be hold ♪

131
00:07:37,190 --> 00:07:40,350
♪ I feel younger when I'm wrong ♪

132
00:07:40,880 --> 00:07:42,840
♪ I've seen highs ♪

133
00:07:42,860 --> 00:07:45,440
♪ I've seen lows ♪

134
00:07:46,370 --> 00:07:47,690
What are you two doing?

135
00:07:52,360 --> 00:07:53,970
Why are you all here?

136
00:07:55,550 --> 00:07:56,610
Well, it's because

137
00:07:56,950 --> 00:07:58,350
we're trying to help you.

138
00:07:58,380 --> 00:07:59,360
You should go back.

139
00:07:59,360 --> 00:08:01,020
Headmaster only punished me.

140
00:08:01,080 --> 00:08:02,370
It's no use telling me.

141
00:08:12,830 --> 00:08:13,430
Jiang Bohan.

142
00:08:13,430 --> 00:08:13,830
Speak.

143
00:08:14,950 --> 00:08:16,080
Tell them to go back.

144
00:08:17,620 --> 00:08:18,460
You should go back.

145
00:08:18,460 --> 00:08:19,630
We'll handle this.

146
00:08:21,390 --> 00:08:22,070
No need.

147
00:08:23,800 --> 00:08:25,460
I find you quite interesting.

148
00:08:25,480 --> 00:08:26,720
Yesterday you said we should keep our distance,

149
00:08:26,720 --> 00:08:28,510
yet here you are again today.

150
00:08:28,510 --> 00:08:30,040
Are you playing hard to get?

151
00:08:30,570 --> 00:08:31,310
Me?

152
00:08:31,680 --> 00:08:32,549
If that's not the case,

153
00:08:32,549 --> 00:08:33,350
please leave.

154
00:08:34,750 --> 00:08:35,280
Alright.

155
00:08:35,750 --> 00:08:36,159
Nian,

156
00:08:36,179 --> 00:08:36,710
let's go.

157
00:08:46,250 --> 00:08:47,580
What are you looking at?

158
00:08:47,960 --> 00:08:48,890
Get back to work.

159
00:08:52,400 --> 00:08:53,070
I told you,

160
00:08:53,130 --> 00:08:54,730
they definitely had a fight.

161
00:08:55,670 --> 00:08:56,730
What are you doing?

162
00:08:58,630 --> 00:09:00,090
I don't want to be scolded.

163
00:09:37,570 --> 00:09:38,300
Jiang Bohan,

164
00:09:38,510 --> 00:09:40,310
why didn't you turn on the light?

165
00:09:46,290 --> 00:09:47,380
I'm talking to you.

166
00:09:49,270 --> 00:09:50,590
Everything's been cleaned up.

167
00:09:50,590 --> 00:09:52,510
Is there anything else that needs to be done?

168
00:09:52,510 --> 00:09:53,150
I know

169
00:09:53,150 --> 00:09:54,320
it was you who got the basketball team

170
00:09:54,320 --> 00:09:55,510
to help her clean.

171
00:09:55,900 --> 00:09:57,100
You're just using her

172
00:09:57,120 --> 00:09:57,990
to go against me.

173
00:09:57,990 --> 00:09:58,630
Can you

174
00:09:58,630 --> 00:10:00,320
stop defining me

175
00:10:00,320 --> 00:10:01,720
by your own assumptions?

176
00:10:01,810 --> 00:10:02,320
How long are you going to

177
00:10:02,320 --> 00:10:04,120
keep fighting with me like this?

178
00:10:08,080 --> 00:10:09,440
A few teams overseas

179
00:10:10,330 --> 00:10:11,190
emailed again.

180
00:10:11,790 --> 00:10:13,590
They're waiting for your reply.

181
00:10:13,680 --> 00:10:14,280
I told you,

182
00:10:17,150 --> 00:10:17,950
I'm not going.

183
00:10:21,300 --> 00:10:22,860
You're really giving up

184
00:10:22,880 --> 00:10:24,680
six years abroad just like that?

185
00:10:25,670 --> 00:10:26,810
Getting into UCLA

186
00:10:26,840 --> 00:10:29,000
isn't something you can just throw away.

187
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:31,670
You're the one who wanted to go pro with basketball—

188
00:10:31,670 --> 00:10:33,270
now you're just giving it up?

189
00:10:37,370 --> 00:10:39,370
Please stop arranging things for me

190
00:10:41,210 --> 00:10:42,940
and stop trying to convince me.

191
00:10:51,780 --> 00:10:53,580
They won't wait for you forever.

192
00:10:55,150 --> 00:10:56,320
All you do lately is waste time.

benefit you?

199
00:11:21,520 --> 00:11:23,000
I'd never been yelled at,

200
00:11:23,280 --> 00:11:25,120

201
00:11:25,120 --> 00:11:27,520

202
00:11:30,050 --> 00:11:31,380

I'll keep my distance from now on.

208
00:11:44,560 --> 00:11:46,870
Did my words hurt him?

209
00:11:47,490 --> 00:11:48,900
Was I too harsh?

210
00:11:50,890 --> 00:11:53,770
Should I add him on WeChat and apologize?

211
00:11:59,630 --> 00:12:01,270
I find you quite interesting.

212
00:12:01,270 --> 00:12:02,550
Yesterday you said we should keep our distance,

213
00:12:02,550 --> 00:12:04,320
yet here you are again today.

214

If that's what he thinks of me,

219
00:12:12,480 --> 00:12:13,810

00:12:22,960 --> 00:12:25,430
you've been working so hard just so I could attend Jingcai College,

222
00:12:25,430 --> 00:12:28,290
but I didn't expect the new semester to be like this.

223
00:12:28,750 --> 00:12:30,240
I've fallen behind in class

224
00:12:30,240 --> 00:12:32,390
and failed to get along with my classmates.

225
00:12:32,390 --> 00:12:33,720
I've disappointed you.

is really overestimating herself.

279
00:14:06,630 --> 00:14:08,720
Her parents must have sent her to Jingcai College

If I were her,

Didn't they say in the group chat?

00:14:18,030 --> 00:14:19,130
Her grades are too poor.

286
00:14:19,130 --> 00:14:21,230
Headmaster has already given her an ultimatum.

287
00:14:21,230 --> 00:14:22,080
Is that true?

288
00:14:22,660 --> 00:14:24,830
Looks like she won't be able to complete her mission.

289
00:14:24,830 --> 00:14:26,630
Of course she can't complete it.

but fortunately, he pulled back in time.

Now he doesn't even pay attention to her.

293
00:14:33,320 --> 00:14:34,200

297
00:14:38,820 --> 00:14:40,600
how could he possibly fall for this trick?

298
00:14:40,600 --> 00:14:42,510
He must have figured it out long ago

If you dare to do it,

00:17:34,940 --> 00:17:35,800
Let me tell you,

383
00:17:35,900 --> 00:17:37,130
I, Yu Mingxi, stand tall

384
00:17:37,130 --> 00:17:37,800
and proud.

385
00:17:37,930 --> 00:17:39,000
Every penny I earn

386
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:40,330
is from my own hard work.

387
00:17:40,400 --> 00:17:41,110
Your baseless rumors

388
00:17:41,110 --> 00:17:42,240
won't bring me down.

389
00:17:43,940 --> 00:17:44,610
Are you finished?

390
00:17:44,610 --> 00:17:45,110
Yes.

391
00:17:51,390 --> 00:17:52,300
Mingxi!

392
00:18:07,310 --> 00:18:08,240
What's going on?

393
00:18:08,420 --> 00:18:09,350
She scolded you.

394
00:18:09,690 --> 00:18:12,170
I meant what happened at school.

395
00:18:12,200 --> 00:18:13,730
She called you a parasite living in luxury.

396
00:18:13,730 --> 00:18:14,100
I...

397
00:18:25,510 --> 00:18:26,440
Did training for three hours

398
00:18:26,440 --> 00:18:27,470
make me miss so much?

399
00:18:27,470 --> 00:18:28,470
That's too harsh.

400
00:18:28,900 --> 00:18:30,300
No wonder she's so angry.

401
00:18:38,320 --> 00:18:42,250
[Close to You]
