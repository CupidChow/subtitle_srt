1
00:00:09,240 --> 00:00:09,750
So,

2
00:00:09,750 --> 00:00:11,190
you didn't get hurt just now, right?

3
00:00:11,190 --> 00:00:11,880
I'm fine.

4
00:00:12,030 --> 00:00:13,240
Did they do anything to you?

5
00:00:13,240 --> 00:00:14,000
Nothing.

6
00:00:15,910 --> 00:00:16,600
But...

7
00:00:16,920 --> 00:00:17,510
why did you run

8
00:00:17,510 --> 00:00:18,670
so far away?

9
00:00:19,880 --> 00:00:21,030
If we had started a fight in your shop,

10
00:00:21,030 --> 00:00:21,960
setting everything else aside,

11
00:00:21,960 --> 00:00:23,420
how would you keep your job

12
00:00:23,560 --> 00:00:24,760
if your boss saw that?

13
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:28,550
You're quite considerate.

14
00:00:31,420 --> 00:00:33,080
Then why did you come after me?

15
00:00:33,560 --> 00:00:35,070
Well, I was just worried you'd get into a fight

16
00:00:35,070 --> 00:00:36,130
and get hurt again.

17
00:00:36,870 --> 00:00:38,330
You were worried about me?

18
00:00:39,200 --> 00:00:40,160
No, I wasn't.

19
00:00:41,350 --> 00:00:42,120
But...

20
00:00:42,780 --> 00:00:44,010
why did you come here?

21
00:00:45,390 --> 00:00:45,960
Me?

22
00:00:47,310 --> 00:00:47,840
I...

23
00:00:48,210 --> 00:00:49,410
I was just passing by.

24
00:00:52,410 --> 00:00:53,210
Are you...

25
00:00:53,240 --> 00:00:54,700
the only one here at night?

26
00:00:55,440 --> 00:00:56,540
Usually, the manager's around,

27
00:00:56,540 --> 00:00:57,890
but he took a day off today.

28
00:00:57,890 --> 00:00:58,420
Besides,

29
00:00:58,440 --> 00:01:00,840
there's a surveillance camera over there.

30
00:01:02,990 --> 00:01:04,050
Aren't you afraid?

31
00:01:04,250 --> 00:01:05,060
Not at all.

32
00:01:11,039 --> 00:01:12,150
What happened to your hand?

33
00:01:12,150 --> 00:01:12,760
Is it okay?

34
00:01:14,020 --> 00:01:14,940
It's fine, really.

35
00:01:14,940 --> 00:01:16,539
Let me get you some medicine.

36
00:01:17,660 --> 00:01:18,590
No need, thanks.

37
00:01:19,400 --> 00:01:20,200
Alright then.

38
00:01:20,310 --> 00:01:21,120
Remember to

39
00:01:21,120 --> 00:01:22,350
put on some ointment when you get home.

40
00:01:22,350 --> 00:01:24,410
After all, you got hurt because of me.

41
00:01:25,220 --> 00:01:27,020
I don't mean anything more by it.

42
00:01:29,890 --> 00:01:30,350
Okay.

43
00:01:30,370 --> 00:01:32,039
If there's nothing else,

44
00:01:32,070 --> 00:01:33,130
I'll be going then.

45
00:01:34,830 --> 00:01:35,509
Wait!

46
00:01:35,850 --> 00:01:36,350
Well.

47
00:01:38,310 --> 00:01:40,039
My flyers were left

48
00:01:40,060 --> 00:01:41,200
on the sports field the other day,

49
00:01:41,200 --> 00:01:42,150
and I heard from my classmates

50
00:01:42,150 --> 00:01:43,770
that someone from your basketball team found them.

51
00:01:43,770 --> 00:01:44,520
Could you

52
00:01:44,539 --> 00:01:45,270
maybe help me ask around?

53
00:01:45,270 --> 00:01:46,320
The

54
00:01:46,479 --> 00:01:47,400
flyers...

55
00:01:50,660 --> 00:01:51,320
I have them.

56
00:01:51,880 --> 00:01:52,590
Really?

57
00:01:53,280 --> 00:01:55,280
Then, could you give them back to me?

58
00:01:56,080 --> 00:01:56,600
Sure,

59
00:01:56,620 --> 00:01:57,390
I'll bring them to you tomorrow.

60
00:01:57,390 --> 00:01:57,720
Okay.

61
00:01:57,740 --> 00:01:58,340
Thank you.

62
00:01:59,190 --> 00:02:00,120
Just the flyers?

63
00:02:02,040 --> 00:02:02,950
Oh no,

64
00:02:03,330 --> 00:02:05,460
he didn't see that love letter, did he?

65
00:02:10,190 --> 00:02:10,680
A

66
00:02:10,680 --> 00:02:11,680
customer is here.

67
00:02:11,870 --> 00:02:12,590
You should get back to work now.

68
00:02:12,590 --> 00:02:13,000
Okay.

69
00:02:35,400 --> 00:02:35,870
Hello?

70
00:02:37,850 --> 00:02:38,970
Be careful

71
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:41,000
when working the night shift alone.

72
00:02:41,460 --> 00:02:42,710
Jiang Bohan?

73
00:02:44,130 --> 00:02:45,190
This is my number.

74
00:02:45,480 --> 00:02:46,190
Save it.

75
00:02:48,480 --> 00:02:49,640
If you're in danger,

76
00:02:50,290 --> 00:02:51,000
call me.

77
00:02:56,310 --> 00:02:57,710
How did you get my number?

78
00:02:59,520 --> 00:03:00,780
Tomorrow morning at 7,

79
00:03:01,360 --> 00:03:02,960
I'll wait for you at the school gate.

80
00:03:02,960 --> 00:03:03,760
Don't be late.

81
00:04:14,270 --> 00:04:17,180
[Close to You]

82
00:04:17,200 --> 00:04:19,660
[EP. 3: I Wrote the Love Letter,
But the One Who Likes You Isn't Me]

83
00:04:21,070 --> 00:04:22,000
Girlfriend?

84
00:04:22,790 --> 00:04:23,990
How is that possible?

85
00:04:24,210 --> 00:04:25,340
It's true.

86
00:04:25,710 --> 00:04:26,880
He said it himself.

87
00:04:27,430 --> 00:04:28,630
His exact words were,

88
00:04:28,870 --> 00:04:30,130
"She is my girlfriend.

89
00:04:30,160 --> 00:04:31,090
Remember that."

90
00:04:31,430 --> 00:04:33,240
"If you dare to mess with her again,

91
00:04:33,240 --> 00:04:34,970
I won't be so gentle next time."

92
00:04:41,920 --> 00:04:42,800
Is she really

93
00:04:42,800 --> 00:04:44,530
worth you getting so worked up?

94
00:04:44,870 --> 00:04:46,680
How could she possibly compare to you?

95
00:04:46,680 --> 00:04:48,409
Since the day I met Jiang Bohan,

96
00:04:48,680 --> 00:04:51,140
no girl has ever been able to get close to him.

97
00:04:51,560 --> 00:04:52,120
This Yu Mingxi,

98
00:04:52,120 --> 00:04:53,920
where on earth did she come from?

99
00:04:55,159 --> 00:04:55,680
I can look into this

100
00:04:55,680 --> 00:04:56,740
if you want to know.

101
00:04:57,040 --> 00:04:57,680
However,

102
00:04:58,190 --> 00:04:58,560
they must have

103
00:04:58,560 --> 00:05:00,220
been together for a while now.

104
00:05:00,800 --> 00:05:01,360
What?

105
00:05:02,190 --> 00:05:04,120
The last time I tried to corner him,

106
00:05:04,190 --> 00:05:05,430
I saw that girl.

107
00:05:08,480 --> 00:05:11,070
Don't go causing trouble for Jiang Bohan anymore.

108
00:05:11,070 --> 00:05:11,600
What?

109
00:05:11,950 --> 00:05:13,410
Feeling sorry for him now?

110
00:05:14,360 --> 00:05:16,020
It's no secret that I like him.

111
00:05:22,600 --> 00:05:23,730
I get hurt every day,

112
00:05:23,750 --> 00:05:25,810
but I've never seen you care about me.

113
00:05:25,830 --> 00:05:26,510
Every day,

114
00:05:26,510 --> 00:05:29,110
I throw myself at you, and you don't give a damn.

115
00:05:29,630 --> 00:05:30,430
Yan Zhengwen,

116
00:05:30,720 --> 00:05:32,180
don't talk to me like that.

117
00:05:32,630 --> 00:05:33,750
You're my brother.

118
00:05:34,830 --> 00:05:36,600
I will never be your brother.

119
00:05:37,240 --> 00:05:38,720
Our parents will never have that kind of relationship.

120
00:05:38,720 --> 00:05:40,320
You don't get to decide that.

121
00:05:44,240 --> 00:05:45,040
Yan Zhengwen.

122
00:05:47,510 --> 00:05:48,190
Help me find out

123
00:05:48,190 --> 00:05:49,790
who this Yu Mingxi really is.

124
00:05:50,510 --> 00:05:51,770
Will you give up if I do?

125
00:05:52,510 --> 00:05:55,370
When have you ever seen me, Qin Siyao, admit defeat?

126
00:05:57,510 --> 00:05:57,920
Fine.

127
00:05:58,720 --> 00:06:01,320
You really won't stop until you hit a wall, huh?

128
00:06:01,950 --> 00:06:03,210
You underestimate me.

129
00:06:04,200 --> 00:06:05,600
Anything I want,

130
00:06:06,350 --> 00:06:07,550
I must have it.

131
00:07:19,920 --> 00:07:20,480
Sorry.

132
00:07:20,600 --> 00:07:21,240
I'm late.

133
00:07:22,070 --> 00:07:22,800
Two minutes.

134
00:07:23,480 --> 00:07:24,280
Are you tired?

135
00:07:24,360 --> 00:07:25,190
It's okay.

136
00:07:27,950 --> 00:07:28,870
Here, your flyers.

137
00:07:28,870 --> 00:07:29,470
Thank you.

138
00:07:36,140 --> 00:07:37,700
What about the other item?

139
00:07:40,870 --> 00:07:41,630
What item?

140
00:07:42,750 --> 00:07:43,800
It's...

141
00:07:44,040 --> 00:07:44,680
just a piece of paper,

142
00:07:44,680 --> 00:07:45,240
and

143
00:07:45,240 --> 00:07:46,720
on it is...

144
00:07:50,430 --> 00:07:51,230
A love letter?

145
00:07:54,159 --> 00:07:55,510
Once a love letter is sent,

146
00:07:55,510 --> 00:07:57,000
there's no taking it back.

147
00:07:58,040 --> 00:07:58,600
But...

148
00:07:58,830 --> 00:08:00,270
didn't you just pick it up?

149
00:08:00,270 --> 00:08:01,430
It wasn't written for you either.

150
00:08:01,430 --> 00:08:02,870
Of course, you should return it to me.

151
00:08:02,870 --> 00:08:04,390
But it has my name on it.

152
00:08:04,390 --> 00:08:05,680
If it wasn't for me...

153
00:08:06,920 --> 00:08:08,360
was it for Lin Shaoyang?

154
00:08:09,240 --> 00:08:10,360
You read it?

155
00:08:13,270 --> 00:08:14,310
It's the first time I've seen a love letter

156
00:08:14,310 --> 00:08:16,110
that uses a universal template.

157
00:08:16,680 --> 00:08:20,080
Just change the name, and it can be given to different people.

158
00:08:24,260 --> 00:08:26,120
How many copies have you sent out?

159
00:08:27,270 --> 00:08:28,190
Was it passed to me

160
00:08:28,190 --> 00:08:29,270
because someone else rejected it?

161
00:08:29,270 --> 00:08:30,330
It's not like that.

162
00:08:31,240 --> 00:08:32,270
So, you had the guts to write it

163
00:08:32,270 --> 00:08:33,330
but not to admit it?

164
00:08:33,630 --> 00:08:34,840
Admit what?

165
00:08:35,080 --> 00:08:36,600
I wrote the love letter,

166
00:08:36,840 --> 00:08:38,640
but I'm not the one who likes you.

167
00:08:40,270 --> 00:08:41,200
But your name

168
00:08:41,200 --> 00:08:42,510
isn't on the letter either.

169
00:08:42,510 --> 00:08:43,390
How can you prove

170
00:08:43,390 --> 00:08:44,270
that the love letter is yours?

171
00:08:44,270 --> 00:08:46,030
There were so many people on the playground that day

172
00:08:46,030 --> 00:08:47,080
who saw that.

173
00:08:47,150 --> 00:08:49,080
It fell down along with the flyers.

174
00:08:49,390 --> 00:08:51,650
But that still doesn't prove it's yours.

175
00:08:53,960 --> 00:08:54,750
Then test me.

176
00:08:59,720 --> 00:09:00,850
The third sentence.

177
00:09:03,520 --> 00:09:04,360
I've...

178
00:09:04,440 --> 00:09:06,170
never been good at pretending.

179
00:09:06,210 --> 00:09:07,440
When I like someone,

180
00:09:07,440 --> 00:09:09,100
it's written all over my eyes.

181
00:09:09,200 --> 00:09:10,460
The seventh sentence.

182
00:09:12,440 --> 00:09:13,440
I...

183
00:09:13,520 --> 00:09:15,600
must find a way to understand you

184
00:09:15,870 --> 00:09:17,840
to tame the wildness in your eyes.

185
00:09:18,200 --> 00:09:19,390
I want to see

186
00:09:19,390 --> 00:09:20,510
your true self,

187
00:09:20,530 --> 00:09:21,460
your true smile.

188
00:09:22,670 --> 00:09:24,960
You borrowed that from Borges

189
00:09:25,630 --> 00:09:28,030
but didn't quite capture the essence, huh?

190
00:09:28,600 --> 00:09:29,660
You even know that?

191
00:09:31,030 --> 00:09:32,690
What about the last sentence?

192
00:09:32,910 --> 00:09:33,390
The...

193
00:09:36,200 --> 00:09:37,000
Well...

194
00:09:37,480 --> 00:09:39,540
Maybe we should just forget about it.

195
00:09:45,480 --> 00:09:46,550
Looks like you don't know after all.

196
00:09:46,550 --> 00:09:47,720
That love letter

197
00:09:47,870 --> 00:09:50,070
probably wasn't written by you, right?

198
00:09:51,390 --> 00:09:51,850
Well...

199
00:09:52,080 --> 00:09:52,670
My lips

200
00:09:52,670 --> 00:09:53,630
taste like strawberries!

201
00:09:53,630 --> 00:09:54,200
Do you

202
00:09:54,200 --> 00:09:54,790
wanna have

203
00:09:54,790 --> 00:09:55,960

Send me the video.

233
00:11:22,120 --> 00:11:23,720
Doesn't she want to confess?

234
00:11:24,360 --> 00:11:25,160
I'll help her.

235
00:11:39,790 --> 00:11:40,510
I'm sorry,

236
00:11:40,510 --> 00:11:40,840
Nian.

237
00:11:40,840 --> 00:11:41,790
I'm late.

238
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:43,080
Where were you?

239
00:11:44,670 --> 00:11:47,200
They were fixing the road in front of my house.

240
00:11:48,510 --> 00:11:50,120
You're not on the sports team.

241
00:11:50,120 --> 00:11:52,180
Why are you so obsessed with running?

242
00:11:52,200 --> 00:11:54,150
Aren't I about to run a marathon?

243
00:11:55,290 --> 00:11:56,150
I don't know what's wrong with me today.

244
00:11:56,150 --> 00:11:56,910
Something...

245
00:11:56,910 --> 00:11:58,000
doesn't feel right.

246
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:00,460
Did you not adjust your breathing properly?

247
00:12:00,510 --> 00:12:02,800
Maybe it's because I didn't have breakfast.

248
00:12:02,800 --> 00:12:04,630
Are you sure it's not an aftereffect

249
00:12:04,630 --> 00:12:06,560
from being hit by that soccer ball?

250
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:07,530
Let's go.

251
00:12:07,550 --> 00:12:09,120
Head to the basketball team...

252
00:12:09,120 --> 00:12:09,790
and confront them.

253
00:12:09,790 --> 00:12:10,480
Do you dare?

254
00:12:11,600 --> 00:12:12,080
I don't.

255
00:12:12,390 --> 00:12:12,850
I don't.

256
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:16,200
What's all the commotion about?

257
00:12:16,200 --> 00:12:16,630
My lips...

258
00:12:16,630 --> 00:12:17,870
Let's go take a look too.

259
00:12:17,870 --> 00:12:19,630
Do you wanna have a little taste?

260
00:12:19,630 --> 00:12:20,290
No, I don't.

261
00:12:22,870 --> 00:12:23,960
What is this?

262
00:12:25,790 --> 00:12:26,990
So, you're Yu Mingxi?

263
00:12:27,120 --> 00:12:28,680
You're the one who likes Jiang Bohan?

264
00:12:28,680 --> 00:12:30,740
Did you really write the love letter?

265
00:12:31,270 --> 00:12:32,960
Did your lips really taste like strawberries?

266
00:12:32,960 --> 00:12:33,840
I don't believe it.

267
00:12:33,840 --> 00:12:34,630
Me neither.

268
00:12:35,240 --> 00:12:36,120
I have a PDF document here.

269
00:12:36,120 --> 00:12:37,520
Do you want to take a look?

270
00:12:39,370 --> 00:12:40,150
Stop tearing them off.

271
00:12:40,150 --> 00:12:41,020
It's useless.

272
00:12:41,240 --> 00:12:42,300
They're already plastered all over the school.

273
00:12:42,300 --> 00:12:43,880
[I want to see your true self, your true smile]

274
00:12:42,300 --> 00:12:43,880
[I must find a way to understand you, to tame the wildness in your eyes]

275
00:12:43,940 --> 00:12:45,960
[I've never been good at pretending; When I like someone,
it's written all over my eyes]

276
00:12:45,990 --> 00:12:46,930
[My lips taste like strawberries;
Do you wanna have a little taste]

277
00:12:52,220 --> 00:12:53,270
Is this her?

278
00:12:53,360 --> 00:12:54,200
It seems to be.

279
00:12:54,330 --> 00:12:55,490
She wrote it?

280
00:12:56,890 --> 00:12:57,950
Let's go, let's go.

281
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:14,790
Yu Mingxi.

282
00:13:15,600 --> 00:13:16,530
What's going on?

283
00:13:17,570 --> 00:13:18,240
It wasn't me.

284
00:13:18,240 --> 00:13:19,390
It really wasn't me.

285
00:13:21,320 --> 00:13:22,830
You have to believe me.

286
00:13:28,080 --> 00:13:29,210
This is a nightmare.

287
00:13:45,510 --> 00:13:46,440
Mingxi,

288
00:13:46,910 --> 00:13:47,790
I'm sorry.

289
00:13:48,200 --> 00:13:49,460
It's all because of me.

290
00:13:49,870 --> 00:13:50,270
But

291
00:13:50,440 --> 00:13:50,720
you

292
00:13:50,870 --> 00:13:53,130
can't keep attending classes like this.

293
00:13:53,870 --> 00:13:55,550
Let's wait until the teacher comes.

294
00:13:55,550 --> 00:13:57,150
I'm a public enemy right now.

295
00:13:58,000 --> 00:13:59,480
Thankfully, we have a class rotation system,

296
00:13:59,480 --> 00:14:01,880
so I don't have to see Jiang Bohan every day.

297
00:14:01,910 --> 00:14:03,310
Who posted those anyway?

298
00:14:03,980 --> 00:14:05,430
Did you offend someone?

299
00:14:05,650 --> 00:14:06,810
I want to know too.

300
00:14:08,340 --> 00:14:09,270
Could it be

301
00:14:09,510 --> 00:14:10,480
Jiang Bohan?

302
00:14:11,720 --> 00:14:12,630
Could it be

303
00:14:12,790 --> 00:14:14,440
that I asked him to give the letter back,

304
00:14:14,440 --> 00:14:16,570
and he got angry out of embarrassment?

305
00:14:19,390 --> 00:14:20,320
Thinking about it that way,

306
00:14:20,320 --> 00:14:21,980
he does seem a bit suspicious.

307
00:14:27,810 --> 00:14:29,410
No wonder he asked to meet up.

308
00:14:29,470 --> 00:14:31,530
He was just planning to humiliate me.

309
00:14:37,620 --> 00:14:39,480
What's the use of being handsome?

310
00:14:39,650 --> 00:14:40,980
I didn't expect that...

311
00:14:41,230 --> 00:14:43,490
He doesn't seem like that kind of person.

312
00:14:46,910 --> 00:14:47,550
Yu Mingxi,

313
00:14:47,550 --> 00:14:48,150
come out for a moment.

314
00:14:48,150 --> 00:14:49,680
I have something to ask you.

315
00:14:50,030 --> 00:14:50,720
Can't it wait

316
00:14:50,720 --> 00:14:51,750
until after school?

317
00:14:51,750 --> 00:14:52,480
No, it can't.

318
00:15:00,390 --> 00:15:02,920
Others might get the wrong idea if they see us.

319
00:15:05,200 --> 00:15:07,000
Jiang Bohan, what exactly are you trying to do?

320
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:09,060
Trying to find a private place to talk.

321
00:15:09,060 --> 00:15:10,510
Then let me walk on my own.

322
00:15:12,080 --> 00:15:12,750
No way.

323
00:15:14,150 --> 00:15:15,150
In 10 minutes,

324
00:15:15,210 --> 00:15:17,400
all students, please gather in the auditorium

325
00:15:17,400 --> 00:15:19,800
for the basketball team's award ceremony.

326
00:15:34,910 --> 00:15:36,030
Jiang Bohan.

327
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:38,330
What are you doing here?

328
00:15:38,910 --> 00:15:40,170
The basketball team's award ceremony is about to start.

329
00:15:40,170 --> 00:15:41,570
Hurry to the auditorium.

330
00:15:44,360 --> 00:15:45,000
The director is looking for you.

331
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:45,800
I'll go first.

332
00:15:49,670 --> 00:15:50,270
Come here.

333
00:15:57,240 --> 00:15:58,720
Jiang Bohan, what exactly do you want to say?

334
00:15:58,720 --> 00:16:00,310
The basketball awards ceremony is about to start now.

335
00:16:00,310 --> 00:16:01,910
As the team captain, you definitely need to be on stage!

336
00:16:01,910 --> 00:16:03,170
The director will surely be looking for you!

337
00:16:03,170 --> 00:16:04,320
I'm tired of all that praise.

338
00:16:04,320 --> 00:16:05,510
It doesn't matter if I go or not.

339
00:16:05,510 --> 00:16:07,370
If you're not going, then I'll go.

340
00:16:08,130 --> 00:16:08,630
Don't you have anything

341
00:16:08,630 --> 00:16:09,720
to explain to me?

342
00:16:10,040 --> 00:16:11,040
Explain what?

343
00:16:11,180 --> 00:16:11,600
The way you're acting,

344
00:16:11,600 --> 00:16:13,030
everyone thinks there's something between us.

345
00:16:13,030 --> 00:16:14,270
Everyone thinks there's something between us.

346
00:16:14,270 --> 00:16:15,480
Isn't that because you posted those love letters

347
00:16:15,480 --> 00:16:16,360
all over the school?

348
00:16:16,360 --> 00:16:17,320
I posted them?

349
00:16:17,390 --> 00:16:18,670
I thought you were the one who did it!

350
00:16:18,670 --> 00:16:19,440
Me?

351
00:16:19,520 --> 00:16:20,290
You set

352
00:16:20,320 --> 00:16:21,600
the time and place for our meeting that day!

353
00:16:21,600 --> 00:16:23,200
You're the most suspicious!

354
00:16:24,910 --> 00:16:26,040
This is ridiculous.

355
00:16:27,720 --> 00:16:28,180
Anyway,

356
00:16:28,300 --> 00:16:29,120
now the whole school

357
00:16:29,120 --> 00:16:30,320
knows that I like you.

358
00:16:31,600 --> 00:16:33,000
They think I like you!

359
00:16:34,030 --> 00:16:35,750
Does it matter what they think?

360
00:16:35,750 --> 00:16:36,510
It does!

361
00:16:36,670 --> 00:16:38,120
You're basically a celebrity around here,

362
00:16:38,120 --> 00:16:39,240
while I'm just a new transfer student!

363
00:16:39,240 --> 00:16:40,670
I haven't even caught up with my studies yet!

364
00:16:40,670 --> 00:16:41,390
Now, because of this,

365
00:16:41,390 --> 00:16:42,470
everyone is isolating me!

366
00:16:42,470 --> 00:16:44,200
Don't you think I feel wronged?

367
00:16:50,910 --> 00:16:51,790
A celebrity...

368
00:16:55,750 --> 00:16:56,280
Let's go.

369
00:16:57,120 --> 00:16:58,050
To the ceremony.

370
00:17:01,480 --> 00:17:01,940
Come on.

371
00:17:14,920 --> 00:17:15,650
Don't worry.

372
00:17:16,510 --> 00:17:18,040
