♪ What to do ♪

194
00:11:45,550 --> 00:11:46,360
Yu Mingxi,

195
00:11:46,860 --> 00:11:48,790
how could you ever compete with me?

196
00:12:12,130 --> 00:12:12,940
Mingxi,

197
00:12:13,380 --> 00:12:15,790
wasn't Jiang Bohan with you this afternoon?

198
00:12:15,790 --> 00:12:18,250
Why did he go on a date with Qin Siyao tonight?

199
00:12:18,390 --> 00:12:20,250
Look at the screenshot I sent you.

200
00:12:38,270 --> 00:12:39,960
Guys, who can relate?

201
00:12:41,670 --> 00:12:43,520
I'm literally speechless.

202
00:12:44,680 --> 00:12:45,890
Such a turnoff guy.

203
00:13:07,320 --> 00:13:09,330
I think we should stop being friends.

204
00:13:09,330 --> 00:13:09,960
Why?

205
00:13:09,980 --> 00:13:11,720
Didn't we just agree yesterday?

206
00:13:11,720 --> 00:13:12,840
Because I like you!

207
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:26,000
You casually take those kinds of photos
with another girl,

208
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:27,440
and yet you say you like me?

209
00:13:27,440 --> 00:13:28,620
Jiang Bohan.

210
00:13:43,030 --> 00:13:44,630
Why did you get up late today?

211
00:13:45,360 --> 00:13:47,090
I didn't sleep well last night.

212
00:13:48,210 --> 00:13:49,070
I'll pick you up

213
00:13:49,080 --> 00:13:50,410
after school today too?

214
00:13:54,460 --> 00:13:55,260
What's wrong?

215
00:13:55,270 --> 00:13:56,070
You seem down.

216
00:13:59,030 --> 00:13:59,560
Nothing.

217
00:14:02,200 --> 00:14:03,360
Do boys

218
00:14:03,360 --> 00:14:04,960
only hug girls they like?

219
00:14:08,030 --> 00:14:09,690
Wait, Jiang Bohan hugged you?

220
00:14:23,630 --> 00:14:24,290
We're here.

221
00:14:40,550 --> 00:14:41,920
Why is he dropping you off again?

222
00:14:41,920 --> 00:14:42,840
Who takes me to school

223
00:14:42,840 --> 00:14:44,240
is none of your business.

224
00:14:44,600 --> 00:14:46,000
And what are we, exactly?

225
00:14:46,150 --> 00:14:47,360
Classmates or friends?

226
00:14:47,360 --> 00:14:49,150
Or childhood sweethearts like you and Qin Siyao?

227
00:14:49,150 --> 00:14:50,550
What did she do this time?

228
00:14:52,580 --> 00:14:54,240
I don't want to argue with you.

229
00:14:54,270 --> 00:14:54,800
Corn.

230
00:14:55,720 --> 00:14:57,380
I'll pick you up after school.

231
00:15:10,870 --> 00:15:12,000
Am I crazy?

232
00:15:12,240 --> 00:15:14,510
I actually brought up Qin Siyao in front of him.

233
00:15:14,510 --> 00:15:15,600
Mingxi,

234
00:15:16,390 --> 00:15:18,720
have you fallen for Jiang Bohan?

235
00:15:19,720 --> 00:15:21,150
Whether I like him or not,

236
00:15:21,320 --> 00:15:22,360
what's the point?

237
00:15:23,160 --> 00:15:24,890
Given my current situation...

238
00:15:29,900 --> 00:15:30,570
Yu Mingxi!

239
00:15:32,270 --> 00:15:33,200
Wait for me after school.

240
00:15:33,200 --> 00:15:34,260
I'll take you home.

241
00:15:35,040 --> 00:15:36,300
Thank you, but no need.

242
00:15:47,600 --> 00:15:48,100
Alright,

243
00:15:48,100 --> 00:15:49,840
everyone, go home and review well.

244
00:15:49,840 --> 00:15:50,840
Class dismissed.

245
00:15:55,560 --> 00:15:56,960
What should we eat later?

246
00:15:57,270 --> 00:15:57,670
I don't know.

247
00:15:57,670 --> 00:15:58,720
Do you want to eat at the cafeteria

248
00:15:58,720 --> 00:15:59,550
or dine outside?

249
00:15:59,550 --> 00:16:00,630
I want to dine outside.

250
00:16:00,630 --> 00:16:01,870
I don't want to go to the cafeteria.

251
00:16:01,870 --> 00:16:03,870
What do you want to eat, then?

252
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:06,930
Didn't a new Western restaurant
just open up nearby?

253
00:16:07,290 --> 00:16:08,150
I want to try it.

254
00:16:08,700 --> 00:16:09,770
Do you want that?

255
00:16:09,790 --> 00:16:10,520
Let's go, go.

256
00:16:13,510 --> 00:16:15,170
Why are you avoiding me again?

257
00:16:16,960 --> 00:16:17,820
School is over.

258
00:16:18,870 --> 00:16:20,200
Let's go home together.

259
00:16:21,790 --> 00:16:22,250
No need.

260
00:16:22,720 --> 00:16:23,250
Let's go.

261
00:16:26,800 --> 00:16:27,530
Yu Mingxi.

262
00:16:28,750 --> 00:16:30,150
Stay behind for a moment.

263
00:16:30,710 --> 00:16:31,840
You two go out first.

264
00:16:33,910 --> 00:16:35,510
I'll wait for you at the door.

265
00:16:44,700 --> 00:16:47,120
I heard that you never attend swimming class.

266
00:16:47,120 --> 00:16:48,720
Is it because of your father?

267
00:16:51,510 --> 00:16:52,240
I...

268
00:16:54,900 --> 00:16:57,280
No matter the reason, skipping class isn't right.

269
00:16:57,280 --> 00:17:00,010
The coach was right to make you clean
the natatorium as punishment.

270
00:17:00,010 --> 00:17:01,140
But I want to ask you,

271
00:17:01,350 --> 00:17:03,240
do you plan to just give up that credit?

272
00:17:03,240 --> 00:17:04,099
Headmistress,

273
00:17:04,160 --> 00:17:06,560
may I make up the credit with other classes?

274
00:17:06,589 --> 00:17:07,750
Basketball, track,

275
00:17:08,030 --> 00:17:08,720
running drills,

276
00:17:08,720 --> 00:17:09,869
or even cheerleading.

277
00:17:09,869 --> 00:17:12,660
Jingcai College is a school known for
its swimming program.

278
00:17:12,660 --> 00:17:15,390
Your father, as a coach, was always proud of that.

279
00:17:15,750 --> 00:17:18,410
Every student at Jingcai must learn how to swim.

280
00:17:18,619 --> 00:17:20,250
It's also a survival skill.

281
00:17:22,030 --> 00:17:23,510
But he drowned...

282
00:17:25,109 --> 00:17:26,200
If he were still here,

283
00:17:26,200 --> 00:17:27,130
what do you think

284
00:17:27,640 --> 00:17:28,900
he would want you to do?

285
00:17:36,120 --> 00:17:38,450
Here's the access card to the natatorium.

286
00:17:39,090 --> 00:17:40,750
Remember to find a good coach.

287
00:17:40,790 --> 00:17:41,510
Be safe.

288
00:17:43,790 --> 00:17:45,250
Thank you, Headmistress.

289
00:17:49,070 --> 00:17:51,000
Don't let others know about this.

290
00:17:52,270 --> 00:17:52,720
Okay.

291
00:18:08,170 --> 00:18:09,430
What did she say to you?

292
00:18:09,960 --> 00:18:10,550
Nothing.

293
00:18:10,880 --> 00:18:12,340
Just told me to study hard.

294
00:18:14,830 --> 00:18:15,290
Really?

295
00:18:16,400 --> 00:18:16,830
Yes.

296
00:18:17,670 --> 00:18:19,270
Then why are you avoiding me?

297
00:18:20,480 --> 00:18:21,270
I'm not.

298
00:18:23,230 --> 00:18:23,920
No?

299
00:18:25,720 --> 00:18:27,120
Then why are you running?

300
00:18:31,400 --> 00:18:32,530
I'm coming! Coming!

301
00:18:32,970 --> 00:18:33,970
Did you wait long?

302
00:18:34,110 --> 00:18:36,920
Put on your little safety helmet.

303
00:18:39,400 --> 00:18:40,200
Let's go home.

304
00:18:42,420 --> 00:18:42,960
Ready?

305
00:18:43,290 --> 00:18:43,820
Let's go.

306
00:18:49,810 --> 00:18:54,180
[Close to You]
