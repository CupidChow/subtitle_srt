00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:11,330
I've finally found you.

2
00:00:13,030 --> 00:00:13,960
Why are you here?

3
00:00:17,230 --> 00:00:18,630
I brought you breakfast.

4
00:00:20,480 --> 00:00:21,940
And I'm worried about you.

5
00:00:23,830 --> 00:00:24,830
I've grown up now.

6
00:00:25,250 --> 00:00:26,280
You don't have to worry about me.

7
00:00:26,280 --> 00:00:27,480
How can I not worry?

8
00:00:33,520 --> 00:00:34,520
Your mother said

9
00:00:35,880 --> 00:00:37,480
that whenever you're troubled,

10
00:00:37,480 --> 00:00:38,880
you will come here alone.

11
00:00:41,670 --> 00:00:42,240
Tell me,

12
00:00:43,210 --> 00:00:43,870
what

13
00:00:44,920 --> 00:00:45,520
happened?

14
00:00:49,790 --> 00:00:50,390
Nothing.

15
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:51,790
I just

16
00:00:52,920 --> 00:00:54,470
wanted to talk to my dad.

17
00:00:59,990 --> 00:01:00,410
Okay.

18
00:01:01,390 --> 00:01:02,790
Then I'll accompany you.

19
00:01:03,350 --> 00:01:04,069
Actually,

20
00:01:04,760 --> 00:01:06,690
I have something to say to him, too.

21
00:01:07,930 --> 00:01:09,330
What are you going to say?

22
00:01:11,810 --> 00:01:12,930
I'll tell him that Corn

23
00:01:12,930 --> 00:01:14,050
has grown up.

24
00:01:14,590 --> 00:01:15,950
She can earn money on her own

25
00:01:15,950 --> 00:01:17,590
and take care of herself.

26
00:01:18,920 --> 00:01:21,320
He doesn't need to worry about her anymore.

00:01:41,640 --> 00:01:42,500

32
00:01:43,759 --> 00:01:44,280

You didn't even tell us in advance.

I didn't have time to meet up with you until today.

100
00:06:28,760 --> 00:06:31,010
I regret not having a daughter.

00:11:11,740 --> 00:11:12,580
You know it.

194
00:11:15,240 --> 00:11:16,640
Stealing a kiss from you?

195
00:11:16,910 --> 00:11:17,390
Shut up.

196
00:11:19,450 --> 00:11:21,050
Didn't you kiss me that time?

197
00:11:21,270 --> 00:11:22,730
You're talking nonsense.

198
00:11:39,880 --> 00:11:41,810
This time, it wasn't a stolen kiss.

199
00:12:22,630 --> 00:12:24,690
Jiang Bohan, you did that on purpose.

200
00:12:33,200 --> 00:12:33,930
Jiang Bohan,

201
00:12:34,360 --> 00:12:35,410
where is the highest place

202
00:12:35,410 --> 00:12:36,440
you've been to?

203
00:12:37,950 --> 00:12:38,590
The

204
00:12:38,800 --> 00:12:39,660
highest place?

205
00:12:40,440 --> 00:12:41,770
Commercial airliners.

206
00:12:41,980 --> 00:12:45,600
The typical cruising altitude is between 8,000 and 10,000 meters.

207
00:12:45,600 --> 00:12:47,460
I'm talking about a place on land.

208
00:12:47,910 --> 00:12:49,750
It would be

209
00:12:50,120 --> 00:12:51,910
Mauna Kea Volcano in Hawaii.

210
00:12:52,750 --> 00:12:54,220
If we don't count elevation,

211
00:12:54,220 --> 00:12:56,890
it is the tallest mountain in the world.

212
00:12:59,850 --> 00:13:01,660
The highest place I've been to

213
00:13:02,130 --> 00:13:03,370
is probably here.

214
00:13:22,510 --> 00:13:23,110
It's okay.

215
00:13:23,970 --> 00:13:27,170
You will have many opportunities to travel in the future.

216
00:13:28,240 --> 00:13:28,790
I

217
00:13:29,320 --> 00:13:31,180
don't want to wait for the future.

218
00:13:31,200 --> 00:13:33,000
I want to go out and see the world.

219
00:13:35,080 --> 00:13:35,810
Jiang Bohan,

220
00:13:38,670 --> 00:13:40,130
let's go abroad together.

221
00:13:41,510 --> 00:13:43,640
Why are you suddenly mentioning this?

222
00:13:44,840 --> 00:13:46,960
My dad borrowed a lot of money

223
00:13:47,750 --> 00:13:49,210
and got into debt to invest

224
00:13:49,260 --> 00:13:50,990
to make me go to Jingcai College

225
00:13:51,380 --> 00:13:52,840
and see the outside world.

226
00:13:53,510 --> 00:13:54,510
So,

227
00:13:55,140 --> 00:13:56,400
I want to study abroad.

228
00:13:56,830 --> 00:13:58,710
It's also a way to fulfil his wish.

229
00:14:00,240 --> 00:14:02,440
Why haven't you mentioned this before?

230
00:14:03,140 --> 00:14:04,530
You know

231
00:14:05,630 --> 00:14:06,830
my family situation.

232
00:14:08,910 --> 00:14:09,770
What about now?

233
00:14:11,960 --> 00:14:12,760
A few days ago,

234
00:14:13,290 --> 00:14:15,090
Senior Dong Zihui came to see me.

235
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:16,790
She said

236
00:14:17,160 --> 00:14:19,030
she wanted me to go abroad with you.

237
00:14:19,030 --> 00:14:19,870
She's willing

238
00:14:20,290 --> 00:14:22,020
to cover my tuition fees first.

239
00:14:23,190 --> 00:14:23,920
Don't worry.

240
00:14:26,030 --> 00:14:26,830
I'll deal with

241
00:14:27,600 --> 00:14:28,530
the money issue.

242
00:14:30,360 --> 00:14:32,090
I want to get the money on my own.

243
00:14:32,240 --> 00:14:34,300
I can apply for school scholarships.

244
00:14:35,180 --> 00:14:37,380
I don't want to owe anyone else anymore.

245
00:14:57,780 --> 00:14:59,020
Didn't you say

246
00:14:59,390 --> 00:15:00,670
you want to go to UCLA?

247
00:15:03,270 --> 00:15:03,750
Yeah.

248
00:15:05,140 --> 00:15:07,270
After my younger brother passed away,

249
00:15:08,380 --> 00:15:09,540
I blamed my mom.

250
00:15:10,270 --> 00:15:12,350
I thought it was all her fault.

251
00:15:15,390 --> 00:15:16,920
I rejected her suggestions

252
00:15:16,960 --> 00:15:18,720
because I wanted to spite her.

253
00:15:22,080 --> 00:15:23,000
But later,

254
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:24,790
I joined the Jingcai College basketball team

255
00:15:24,790 --> 00:15:26,520
and attended the youth league.

256
00:15:27,080 --> 00:15:29,080
I couldn't abandon my teammates

257
00:15:30,010 --> 00:15:31,370
and let down my team

258
00:15:31,690 --> 00:15:33,290
for the sake of my own dreams.

259
00:15:34,880 --> 00:15:35,550
So,

260
00:15:36,140 --> 00:15:37,540
after this competition,

261
00:15:37,790 --> 00:15:40,050
you can think about going abroad, right?

262
00:15:41,140 --> 00:15:42,000
What about you?

263
00:15:44,510 --> 00:15:45,200
I...

264
00:15:45,220 --> 00:15:46,300
I will definitely do

265
00:15:46,300 --> 00:15:47,300
what I promised.

266
00:16:01,810 --> 00:16:03,000
It's a deal.

267
00:16:10,910 --> 00:16:11,710
That's great.

268
00:16:12,120 --> 00:16:13,190
In a few days,

269
00:16:13,590 --> 00:16:16,030
you'll go play in the basketball tournament,

270
00:16:16,030 --> 00:16:18,160
and I'll participate in the marathon.

271
00:16:18,240 --> 00:16:19,200
We'll both have

272
00:16:19,550 --> 00:16:20,480
a bright future.

274
00:16:23,010 --> 00:16:24,120
Then, let's

00:16:26,270 --> 00:16:27,400
cheer each other on.

Today,

279
00:16:57,600 --> 00:16:58,640
let's say goodbye here.

280
00:16:58,640 --> 00:16:59,190
It's too late.

281
00:16:59,190 --> 00:17:00,450
You should go back now.

282
00:17:01,480 --> 00:17:04,010
I always walk you up to your apartment before.

283
00:17:04,720 --> 00:17:05,920
Today is different.

284
00:17:07,030 --> 00:17:07,829
Why?

285
00:17:09,190 --> 00:17:10,950
The weather forecast says

286
00:17:11,200 --> 00:17:12,599
it's going to rain tonight.

287
00:17:12,599 --> 00:17:14,160
You have a game coming up soon.

288
00:17:14,160 --> 00:17:15,109
Don't catch a cold.

289
00:17:15,109 --> 00:17:16,640
Or I'll be worried.

290
00:17:17,829 --> 00:17:18,359
Alright.

291
00:17:19,010 --> 00:17:20,000
Go back by yourself, then.

292
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:21,000
I'm heading home.

293
00:17:21,619 --> 00:17:22,140
Bye.

294
00:17:22,480 --> 00:17:22,910
Bye.

295
00:17:22,940 --> 00:17:24,270
I'll text you when I get home.

296
00:17:24,270 --> 00:17:24,630
Okay.

297
00:17:24,650 --> 00:17:25,109
I'm off.

298
00:17:25,440 --> 00:17:25,790
Bye.

299
00:17:47,840 --> 00:17:49,260
I've already paid back the money my dad owed you.

300
00:17:49,260 --> 00:17:50,340
What else do you want?

301
00:17:50,340 --> 00:17:51,510
The contract your father signed with us

302
00:17:51,510 --> 00:17:52,880
clearly states that

303
00:17:54,860 --> 00:17:55,820
late payment

304
00:17:56,320 --> 00:17:57,580
doubles the interest.

305
00:17:57,770 --> 00:17:59,630
There are traps in your contract.

306
00:17:59,810 --> 00:18:02,140
I won't pay money that I shouldn't have to.

307
00:18:04,070 --> 00:18:05,730
If you don't pay back the money

308
00:18:06,440 --> 00:18:07,640
in three days,

309
00:18:08,720 --> 00:18:09,830
wait and see.

310
00:18:10,830 --> 00:18:11,630
Cut the crap.

311
00:18:11,650 --> 00:18:12,180
Let's go.
