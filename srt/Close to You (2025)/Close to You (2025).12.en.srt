1
00:00:21,020 --> 00:00:22,480
Stop looking for that guy.

2
00:00:22,830 --> 00:00:24,490
I’m the one who is keeping her.

3
00:00:34,300 --> 00:00:35,630
Yu Mingxi, go out first.

4
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:40,730
Jiang Bohan, watch your mouth.

5
00:00:48,350 --> 00:00:49,240
This is my car.

6
00:00:49,240 --> 00:00:50,300
I think you know it.

7
00:00:53,920 --> 00:00:55,880
I've been tutoring her recently.

8
00:00:56,660 --> 00:00:58,200
She needs a scholarship.

9
00:00:58,200 --> 00:01:00,130
She needs to take the midterm exam.

10
00:01:00,710 --> 00:01:03,000
First, you threatened her to drop out with her grades.

11
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:04,480
Then, you didn't allow her to take the exam.

12
00:01:04,480 --> 00:01:06,040
Is this your plan?

13
00:01:06,480 --> 00:01:07,370
Are you done?

14
00:01:08,840 --> 00:01:10,630
I didn't force her to drop out.

15
00:01:10,850 --> 00:01:12,130
With her grades,

16
00:01:12,330 --> 00:01:15,050
she cannot adapt to studying in an international school.

17
00:01:15,050 --> 00:01:15,970
She can't get an offer.

18
00:01:15,970 --> 00:01:17,280
when she graduates.

19
00:01:17,910 --> 00:01:18,870
Returning to the original school

20
00:01:18,870 --> 00:01:20,840
is a better choice for her.

21
00:01:21,310 --> 00:01:23,310
It's not because of her bad grades

22
00:01:23,330 --> 00:01:24,590
but because of her family.

23
00:01:24,590 --> 00:01:25,330
She is under too much pressure.

24
00:01:25,330 --> 00:01:25,930
Her dad...

25
00:01:30,430 --> 00:01:31,710
Her mom is always away.

26
00:01:31,710 --> 00:01:33,310
She has to be her own parents.

27
00:01:33,400 --> 00:01:34,350
As a teacher,

28
00:01:34,350 --> 00:01:35,789
have you ever cared about her?

29
00:01:35,789 --> 00:01:37,590
I'm concerned about her now.

30
00:01:39,350 --> 00:01:41,280
Then why did you suspend her class?

31
00:01:41,870 --> 00:01:43,420
Do you think I can solve

32
00:01:43,580 --> 00:01:45,720
every problem in the school easily?

33
00:01:45,950 --> 00:01:47,979
I have to explain to the parents

34
00:01:48,070 --> 00:01:50,030
and even the school board.

35
00:01:50,580 --> 00:01:51,310
Jiang Bohan,

36
00:01:51,509 --> 00:01:53,350
can you consider yourself

37
00:01:53,490 --> 00:01:55,360
and your future first?

38
00:01:56,070 --> 00:01:57,870
Don't waste your time on a girl,

39
00:01:58,240 --> 00:01:59,080
which will affect your future

40
00:01:59,080 --> 00:01:59,900
and delay your studying abroad.

41
00:01:59,900 --> 00:02:02,100
Don't you know why I'm not going abroad?

42
00:02:07,040 --> 00:02:09,169
Don't pretend that nothing happened.

43
00:02:12,580 --> 00:02:14,580
Don't think you're irresponsible.

44
00:03:20,250 --> 00:03:22,790
[Close to You]

45
00:03:22,820 --> 00:03:25,250
[Episode 12 Corn, how have you been?]

46
00:03:28,280 --> 00:03:29,240
Mingxi,

47
00:03:29,690 --> 00:03:30,940
you did nothing wrong.

48
00:03:30,940 --> 00:03:32,710
Why aren't you allowed to attend class?

49
00:03:32,710 --> 00:03:35,430
The school officers said they should follow the procedures.

50
00:03:35,430 --> 00:03:36,870
This is bullying.

51
00:03:37,060 --> 00:03:39,130
When did Jingcai College have such procedures?

52
00:03:39,130 --> 00:03:40,320
Students are suspended from classes

53
00:03:40,320 --> 00:03:41,880
because of some rumors, huh?

54
00:03:41,880 --> 00:03:42,940
I'll go to the Headmaster.

55
00:03:42,940 --> 00:03:43,400
Alright.

56
00:03:43,400 --> 00:03:44,000
Forget it.

57
00:03:44,400 --> 00:03:45,079
That's it.

58
00:03:45,360 --> 00:03:46,990
I will take it as a rest at home for a few days.

59
00:03:46,990 --> 00:03:48,470
But you are wronged.

60
00:03:49,120 --> 00:03:49,720
It's okay.

61
00:03:49,910 --> 00:03:50,840
Go back now.

62
00:03:50,990 --> 00:03:52,650
Remember to take notes for me.

63
00:03:53,560 --> 00:03:55,630
I'll tell you what happens at school.

64
00:04:00,010 --> 00:04:00,450
Bye.

65
00:04:17,870 --> 00:04:19,390
She needs to take the midterm exam.

66
00:04:19,390 --> 00:04:20,870
She needs a scholarship.

67
00:04:21,290 --> 00:04:24,220
Do you know how important this scholarship is to her?

68
00:04:26,850 --> 00:04:27,390
Hello.

69
00:04:27,390 --> 00:04:29,120
Do you want a haircut or a style?

70
00:04:30,180 --> 00:04:30,630
Okay.

71
00:04:30,650 --> 00:04:31,650
This way, please.

72
00:04:48,240 --> 00:04:48,830
Hello.

73
00:04:48,960 --> 00:04:51,090
Are you sure you want to sell your hair?

74
00:04:52,380 --> 00:04:53,380
Cut it short here?

75
00:05:21,590 --> 00:05:22,810
It's 1,200 yuan in total.

76
00:05:22,810 --> 00:05:26,340
The staff at the reception will transfer the money to you later.

77
00:05:32,220 --> 00:05:32,880
Hello, Mom.

78
00:05:34,080 --> 00:05:34,600
Baby,

79
00:05:35,080 --> 00:05:36,409
how is your school life?

80
00:05:37,630 --> 00:05:38,310
I got

81
00:05:38,860 --> 00:05:40,140
a scholarship of

82
00:05:40,750 --> 00:05:42,750
1,200 yuan.

83
00:05:43,490 --> 00:05:46,310
You don't have to give me this month's living expenses.

84
00:05:46,310 --> 00:05:47,120
Really?

85
00:05:47,850 --> 00:05:49,310
My daughter is excellent.

86
00:05:50,500 --> 00:05:51,020
Mom,

87
00:05:51,750 --> 00:05:53,080
when will you come back?

88
00:05:53,590 --> 00:05:55,310
I'll treat you to something nice.

89
00:05:55,310 --> 00:05:57,240
You don't even want to buy yourself delicious food.

90
00:05:57,240 --> 00:05:58,640
I'll treat you this time.

91
00:05:58,800 --> 00:06:00,380
I've been busy in the factory lately.

92
00:06:00,380 --> 00:06:02,500
I'll be available after we finish this order.

93
00:06:02,500 --> 00:06:03,450
Let's celebrate

94
00:06:03,640 --> 00:06:05,560
after I go back home.

95
00:06:05,810 --> 00:06:06,330
Mom,

96
00:06:07,240 --> 00:06:08,160
I miss you.

97
00:06:08,600 --> 00:06:10,000
I miss you too.

98
00:06:10,400 --> 00:06:11,660
Take care of yourself.

99
00:06:11,830 --> 00:06:13,160
Have your meals on time.

100
00:06:13,420 --> 00:06:14,370
I have to go.

101
00:06:14,400 --> 00:06:14,920
Bye.

102
00:07:06,830 --> 00:07:07,560
Where is he?

103
00:07:08,400 --> 00:07:09,060
He escaped.

104
00:07:10,090 --> 00:07:10,650
Go after him!

105
00:07:10,650 --> 00:07:11,580
Don't let him go.

106
00:07:37,450 --> 00:07:39,180
Why did You Jingchu run so fast?

107
00:07:43,560 --> 00:07:44,270
Hello.

108
00:07:44,680 --> 00:07:46,310
How can I help you?

109
00:07:51,920 --> 00:07:52,600
Corn?

110
00:07:54,080 --> 00:07:54,710
It's me,

111
00:07:55,590 --> 00:07:56,510
You Jingchu.

112
00:07:58,750 --> 00:07:59,870
You Jingchu?

113
00:08:00,390 --> 00:08:02,560
You are grown up now and so tall.

114
00:08:03,090 --> 00:08:05,150
You're only two months older than me.

115
00:08:05,550 --> 00:08:07,210
Why haven't you grown taller?

116
00:08:07,680 --> 00:08:08,940
I want to know why, too.

117
00:08:17,150 --> 00:08:17,810
Who are you?

118
00:08:18,040 --> 00:08:18,600
Who is he?

119
00:08:19,430 --> 00:08:20,960
What's your relationship?

120
00:08:21,310 --> 00:08:22,840
What's your relationship?

121
00:08:23,700 --> 00:08:24,720
This is my

122
00:08:24,830 --> 00:08:25,490
classmate.

123
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:27,270
This is my...

124
00:08:27,270 --> 00:08:28,750
We bathed together when we were young.

125
00:08:28,750 --> 00:08:30,040
What nonsense are you talking about?

126
00:08:30,040 --> 00:08:31,040
I'm not talking nonsense.

127
00:08:31,040 --> 00:08:32,000
I have a photo.

128
00:08:32,020 --> 00:08:32,390
Okay.

129
00:08:32,390 --> 00:08:32,669
Stop. Stop.

130
00:08:32,669 --> 00:08:33,130
No need.

131
00:08:34,480 --> 00:08:35,080
By the way,

132
00:08:35,390 --> 00:08:37,250
why did those people go after you?

133
00:08:37,720 --> 00:08:38,270
They...

134
00:08:39,169 --> 00:08:40,320
They failed to defeat me.

135
00:08:40,320 --> 00:08:41,580
So, they want revenge.

136
00:08:42,390 --> 00:08:43,120
It seems

137
00:08:43,610 --> 00:08:44,870
you are quite naughty.

138
00:08:45,080 --> 00:08:45,480
You...

139
00:08:46,950 --> 00:08:48,320
You are her classmate, right?

140
00:08:48,320 --> 00:08:49,200
You're already wet.

141
00:08:49,200 --> 00:08:49,840
It is too crowded.

142
00:08:49,840 --> 00:08:50,310
Go out.

143
00:08:52,050 --> 00:08:52,980
Aren't you wet, too?

144
00:08:52,980 --> 00:08:54,440
Why do you need an umbrella?

145
00:08:54,440 --> 00:08:56,120
I'm going home with Corn.

146
00:08:56,120 --> 00:08:56,720
Your home isn't in this direction.

147
00:08:56,720 --> 00:08:56,910
What do you want to do?

148
00:08:56,910 --> 00:08:58,000
Who said you can go home together?

149
00:08:58,000 --> 00:08:58,480
No.

150
00:08:58,480 --> 00:08:59,630
Why can't we go home together?

151
00:08:59,630 --> 00:09:00,510
Give it to me.

152
00:09:00,630 --> 00:09:01,150
Give it to me.

153
00:09:01,150 --> 00:09:02,120
No.

154
00:09:02,200 --> 00:09:02,840
No.

155
00:09:02,840 --> 00:09:03,270
Give it to me.

156
00:09:03,270 --> 00:09:04,200
Get out!

157
00:09:04,220 --> 00:09:05,150
Get out!

158
00:09:05,340 --> 00:09:06,750
You go out. We'll go back together.

159
00:09:06,750 --> 00:09:07,480
Get out!

160
00:09:07,480 --> 00:09:07,720
Get out!

161
00:09:07,720 --> 00:09:08,170
Alright.

162
00:09:08,170 --> 00:09:09,130
Stop fighting.

163
00:09:12,440 --> 00:09:13,000
It seems

164
00:09:13,510 --> 00:09:14,510
the rain stopped.

165
00:09:18,510 --> 00:09:19,370
Since the rain has stopped,

166
00:09:19,370 --> 00:09:20,700
let's go home together.

167
00:09:22,390 --> 00:09:23,200
Why?

168
00:09:24,920 --> 00:09:25,930
Good.

169
00:09:25,960 --> 00:09:27,660
You're so chubby now.

170
00:09:32,080 --> 00:09:32,810
Are you done?

171
00:09:39,680 --> 00:09:41,280
There are three of you today.

172
00:09:43,470 --> 00:09:44,420
So many people.

173
00:09:48,350 --> 00:09:49,280
You two go first.

174
00:10:10,640 --> 00:10:11,300
Who are you?

175
00:10:12,170 --> 00:10:13,200
None of your business.

176
00:10:13,200 --> 00:10:14,060
Get lost!

177
00:10:32,180 --> 00:10:33,110
Watch your back!

178
00:10:52,080 --> 00:10:52,750
Help!

179
00:11:04,350 --> 00:11:05,280
Let me beat them.

180
00:11:07,270 --> 00:11:08,060
Alright.

181
00:11:08,080 --> 00:11:08,610
Let's go.

182
00:11:09,410 --> 00:11:09,970
My bag.

183
00:11:22,400 --> 00:11:23,080
Come in.

184
00:11:23,190 --> 00:11:24,790
No need to change your shoes.

185
00:11:26,990 --> 00:11:27,600
My clothes are wet.

186
00:11:27,600 --> 00:11:28,930
I'll get changed first.

187
00:11:43,630 --> 00:11:45,920
This is the school uniform you left here last time.

188
00:11:45,920 --> 00:11:46,980
I washed it for you.

189
00:11:48,670 --> 00:11:49,130
Thanks.

190
00:11:51,120 --> 00:11:51,840
You Jingchu,

191
00:11:51,840 --> 00:11:54,550
can't you wait until I get in to change your clothes?

192
00:11:54,550 --> 00:11:55,320
What?

193
00:11:55,450 --> 00:11:56,740
You saw my body before.

194
00:11:57,290 --> 00:11:59,350
What nonsense are you talking about?

195
00:11:59,600 --> 00:12:00,840
When we took a shower together in our childhood...

196
00:12:00,840 --> 00:12:01,670
You Jingchu!

197
00:12:10,440 --> 00:12:11,120
By the way,

198
00:12:11,600 --> 00:12:13,200
did you two get hurt just now?

199
00:12:15,350 --> 00:12:16,510
I'm fine. Don't worry.

200
00:12:16,510 --> 00:12:17,040
I'm fine.

201
00:12:24,030 --> 00:12:24,840
Who are you?

202
00:12:28,440 --> 00:12:28,790
Mom,

203
00:12:28,810 --> 00:12:29,600
you're back.

204
00:12:30,510 --> 00:12:31,630
They are my friends.

205
00:12:31,630 --> 00:12:32,830
They will leave soon.

206
00:12:33,200 --> 00:12:34,550
-Hello, aunt.
-Hello, aunt.

207
00:12:34,550 --> 00:12:35,550
Watch your mouth.

208
00:12:35,630 --> 00:12:37,090
Let your friends sit down.

209
00:12:38,550 --> 00:12:39,000
Aunt,

210
00:12:40,320 --> 00:12:41,580
don't you remember me?

211
00:12:42,270 --> 00:12:43,000
I'm Jingchu.

212
00:12:46,010 --> 00:12:47,320
Jingchu.

213
00:12:48,200 --> 00:12:50,150
I haven't seen you for so many years.

214
00:12:50,150 --> 00:12:51,150
You're so strong.

215
00:12:51,550 --> 00:12:52,420
I've been well.

216
00:12:53,240 --> 00:12:54,770
Let me help you carry these things.

217
00:12:54,770 --> 00:12:55,240
Okay.

218
00:12:56,670 --> 00:12:57,440
By the way, Mom,

219
00:12:57,440 --> 00:12:58,510
he's my classmate,

220
00:12:58,510 --> 00:12:59,240
Jiang Bohan.

221
00:13:00,230 --> 00:13:00,720
Hello, aunt.

222
00:13:00,720 --> 00:13:01,600
Hello.

223
00:13:02,200 --> 00:13:02,600
Look,

224
00:13:02,950 --> 00:13:05,670
before school started, I was worried that you couldn't fit in.

225
00:13:05,670 --> 00:13:07,360
Now I feel relieved

226
00:13:07,680 --> 00:13:09,260
after seeing you get along with your classmates.

227
00:13:09,260 --> 00:13:10,720
We're getting along well.

228
00:13:11,150 --> 00:13:12,980
I wanted to come back early to cook for you

229
00:13:12,980 --> 00:13:13,910
to surprise you.

230
00:13:14,220 --> 00:13:15,870
Why are you back so early today?

231
00:13:15,870 --> 00:13:17,080
Didn't you go to school?

232
00:13:17,080 --> 00:13:17,360
I...

233
00:13:17,650 --> 00:13:18,030
Yes.

234
00:13:18,050 --> 00:13:19,780
Why are you back so early today?

235
00:13:21,960 --> 00:13:23,500
There's an event at school today.

236
00:13:23,500 --> 00:13:24,900
The school is over early.

237
00:13:25,550 --> 00:13:26,550
I'll wash the fruits for you.

238
00:13:26,550 --> 00:13:27,630
Did you skip class?

239
00:13:29,160 --> 00:13:31,220
You haven't changed your childhood habit.

240
00:13:31,220 --> 00:13:32,080
Let me help you.

241
00:13:34,550 --> 00:13:35,210
Have a seat.

242
00:13:50,030 --> 00:13:50,890
Who's calling?

243
00:13:50,910 --> 00:13:52,240
Why don't you answer it?

244
00:13:52,460 --> 00:13:52,990
Nothing.

245
00:13:57,670 --> 00:13:58,550
What is it?

246
00:13:59,180 --> 00:13:59,980
Where are you?

247
00:14:01,030 --> 00:14:02,910
Are you with Yu Mingxi again?

248
00:14:03,170 --> 00:14:04,300
I'm at her house now.

249
00:14:05,450 --> 00:14:06,250
Come back quickly.

250
00:14:06,250 --> 00:14:07,320
I need to talk to you.

251
00:14:07,320 --> 00:14:09,270
Why can't you tell me on the phone?

252
00:14:09,840 --> 00:14:10,900
Come back quickly.

253
00:14:13,830 --> 00:14:14,390
What happened?

254
00:14:14,390 --> 00:14:14,920
Who is it?

255
00:14:17,720 --> 00:14:18,270
My mom.

256
00:14:19,080 --> 00:14:19,920
Then you should leave now.

257
00:14:19,920 --> 00:14:21,200
She must have something to do with you.

258
00:14:21,200 --> 00:14:21,510
Nothing.

259
00:14:21,510 --> 00:14:22,030
Come on.

260
00:14:22,200 --> 00:14:23,130
Have some pears.

261
00:14:23,960 --> 00:14:24,270
Mom,

262
00:14:24,440 --> 00:14:25,120
Jiang Bohan has something to do.

263
00:14:25,120 --> 00:14:25,980
He has to leave.

264
00:14:27,960 --> 00:14:30,010
I'll visit you another day.

265
00:14:30,310 --> 00:14:31,150
You're going to leave?

266
00:14:31,150 --> 00:14:32,050
Why don't you stay here a bit longer?

267
00:14:32,050 --> 00:14:32,550
No.

268
00:14:32,630 --> 00:14:34,160
His mother wants to see him.

269
00:14:35,720 --> 00:14:36,080
Bye.

270
00:14:36,520 --> 00:14:37,380
Goodbye, aunt.

271
00:14:38,250 --> 00:14:39,000
Take care.

272
00:14:39,600 --> 00:14:40,200
Take care.

273
00:14:41,910 --> 00:14:43,240
Why aren't you leaving?

274
00:14:43,960 --> 00:14:44,890
I just came here.

275
00:14:45,050 --> 00:14:47,010
I have a lot to say to aunt.

276
00:14:47,390 --> 00:14:47,750
Okay.

277
00:14:48,200 --> 00:14:49,260
Then, talk to aunt.

278
00:14:49,680 --> 00:14:50,880
Yu Mingxi, see me off.

279
00:14:51,670 --> 00:14:52,870
I’ll see him off.

280
00:14:53,240 --> 00:14:53,630
Okay.

281
00:14:54,040 --> 00:14:54,890
Your coat.

282
00:15:08,200 --> 00:15:09,480
You are really a young master.

283
00:15:09,480 --> 00:15:11,680
You even need me to send you downstairs.

284
00:15:20,480 --> 00:15:21,670
Jiang Bohan, what are you doing?

285
00:15:21,670 --> 00:15:23,130
Why did you suddenly stop?

286
00:15:27,720 --> 00:15:28,480
I'll help you

287
00:15:29,580 --> 00:15:30,780
with the suspension.

288
00:15:35,080 --> 00:15:36,150
I don't know

289
00:15:37,070 --> 00:15:38,330
how to comfort others.

290
00:15:39,720 --> 00:15:41,240
If you feel wronged,

291
00:15:44,660 --> 00:15:45,790
you can bite me, too.

292
00:15:50,630 --> 00:15:51,630
Are you crazy?

293
00:15:51,630 --> 00:15:52,320
I'm not a dog.

294
00:15:52,320 --> 00:15:53,520
Why should I bite you?

295
00:15:58,600 --> 00:15:59,460
One more thing.

296
00:16:00,170 --> 00:16:02,430
What's your relationship with that guy?

297
00:16:05,370 --> 00:16:06,570
You mean You Jingchu?

298
00:16:06,840 --> 00:16:08,790
We grew up together.

299
00:16:08,960 --> 00:16:10,820
I treat him as my younger brother.

300
00:16:10,940 --> 00:16:11,530
Really?

301
00:16:16,680 --> 00:16:18,900
Tell him to go home as soon as possible.

302
00:16:18,950 --> 00:16:20,750
Do not let him stay at your house.

303
00:16:22,230 --> 00:16:22,760
Let's go.

304
00:16:27,560 --> 00:16:29,360
Don't worry about the suspension.

305
00:16:29,360 --> 00:16:29,890
I’m here.

306
00:16:57,100 --> 00:16:58,670
Mingxi was immature back then.

307
00:16:58,670 --> 00:16:59,790
She bullied you a lot.

308
00:16:59,790 --> 00:17:00,150
Yes.

309
00:17:00,150 --> 00:17:01,240
Look at the mark she just bit.

310
00:17:01,240 --> 00:17:02,170
It's still here.

311
00:17:02,390 --> 00:17:03,030
She bit you again?

312
00:17:03,030 --> 00:17:03,270
Yes.

313
00:17:03,270 --> 00:17:04,470
You should scold her.

314
00:17:04,660 --> 00:17:05,550
She can't always bully me.

315
00:17:05,550 --> 00:17:07,550
-I will scold her.
-We have grown up.

316
00:17:09,270 --> 00:17:09,790
Mingxi,

317
00:17:10,960 --> 00:17:12,160
Jingchu just came here.

318
00:17:12,160 --> 00:17:12,760
You need to

319
00:17:12,920 --> 00:17:13,849
take care of him.

320
00:17:14,130 --> 00:17:14,579
Okay.

321
00:17:16,030 --> 00:17:16,359
Aunt,

322
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:17,640
I

323
00:17:18,240 --> 00:17:19,640
just enrolled in a sports school.

324
00:17:19,640 --> 00:17:21,440
I'm not familiar with this place.

325
00:17:21,440 --> 00:17:23,550
I came to you before informing you.

326
00:17:23,750 --> 00:17:25,349
Sorry for causing you trouble.

327
00:17:25,349 --> 00:17:26,730
Jingchu, you're too courteous.

328
00:17:26,730 --> 00:17:28,530
Your father and Mingxi's father

329
00:17:28,610 --> 00:17:29,740
were like brothers.

330
00:17:29,880 --> 00:17:30,880
Though they died,

331
00:17:31,240 --> 00:17:33,240
we have to rely on each other, right?

332
00:17:35,510 --> 00:17:38,040
Maybe they are shooting the breeze in heaven.

333
00:17:38,410 --> 00:17:39,910
We should live a good life.

334
00:17:44,900 --> 00:17:45,280
By the way,

335
00:17:45,280 --> 00:17:47,650
what did you say you majored in?

336
00:17:49,240 --> 00:17:49,700
Boxing.

337
00:17:49,750 --> 00:17:50,440
Boxing?

338
00:17:51,200 --> 00:17:52,130
Is it dangerous?

339
00:17:52,440 --> 00:17:53,640
Is it easy to get hurt?

340
00:17:54,200 --> 00:17:55,130
It's okay, aunt.

341
00:17:55,200 --> 00:17:56,550
I am professional.

342
00:17:56,850 --> 00:17:58,110
I will protect myself.

343
00:17:58,510 --> 00:17:59,480
I’m relieved.

344
00:18:00,070 --> 00:18:02,200
With you at home with Mingxi,

345
00:18:02,510 --> 00:18:03,370
I feel relieved

346
00:18:03,920 --> 00:18:04,810
when I'm away.

347
00:18:05,590 --> 00:18:07,390
But you have to sleep on the sofa.

348
00:18:08,030 --> 00:18:08,630
It's okay.

349
00:18:09,240 --> 00:18:10,800
It's a small house. Let's squeeze in it.

350
00:18:10,800 --> 00:18:11,400
We're close,

351
00:18:11,400 --> 00:18:11,830
right?

352
00:18:12,240 --> 00:18:13,180
Wait, Mom,

353
00:18:13,550 --> 00:18:15,150
you let him live in our house?

354
00:18:20,160 --> 00:18:24,280
[Close to You]
