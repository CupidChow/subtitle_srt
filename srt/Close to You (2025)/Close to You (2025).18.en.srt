He's going through puberty now.

7
00:00:26,430 --> 00:00:28,400
He needs to vent his temper.

8
00:00:28,830 --> 00:00:31,120
He'll come back after he figures things out.

9
00:00:31,120 --> 00:00:32,310
There's a physical fitness test tomorrow.

if I had chased after him then,

00:00:53,350 --> 00:00:55,240
it would be the last time I saw him.

16

On the day of his funeral,

I felt like I was in a dream.

18
00:01:01,680 --> 00:01:04,209
I thought maybe he had gone somewhere to play.

19
00:01:04,840 --> 00:01:06,210
Maybe he just went on a long trip

20
00:01:06,210 --> 00:01:07,940
and would be back after a while.

21
00:01:09,710 --> 00:01:10,950

22
00:01:11,539 --> 00:01:12,380

157
00:10:15,790 --> 00:10:17,480

158
00:10:17,480 --> 00:10:18,790
I was your dance partner and never told me in advance.

159
00:10:18,790 --> 00:10:20,200

160
00:10:20,200 --> 00:10:22,530

162
00:10:25,750 --> 00:10:28,150

164
00:10:31,080 --> 00:10:32,610

170

I'm here for you.

190
00:12:23,510 --> 00:12:25,370
No one will dare gossip about you.

191
00:12:26,320 --> 00:12:29,050
I don't want to see him dancing with Yu Mingxi.

192
00:12:30,960 --> 00:12:31,690
Don't worry.

193
00:12:32,240 --> 00:12:33,770
They won't be able to dance.

194
00:12:42,870 --> 00:12:43,870
Tell me,

195
00:12:44,230 --> 00:12:45,790
did I say yes to Jiang Bohan

196
00:12:45,950 --> 00:12:47,040
too casually?

197
00:12:49,210 --> 00:12:50,930
You'll be Jiang Bohan's dance partner,

198
00:12:50,930 --> 00:12:52,240
but you're still not satisfied?

199
00:12:52,240 --> 00:12:54,440
You really don't know how lucky you are.

200
00:12:55,320 --> 00:12:57,730
I have to work at the convenience store on Wednesday.

201
00:12:57,730 --> 00:12:59,850
I have to take a half-day off and my salary will be deducted.

202
00:12:59,850 --> 00:13:02,180
Besides, I'm not fit for such an occasion.

203
00:13:02,470 --> 00:13:04,270
Maybe I should refuse him later.

204
00:13:04,390 --> 00:13:05,480
You must go.

205
00:13:05,890 --> 00:13:07,640
No one invited me to be his dance partner.

206
00:13:07,640 --> 00:13:08,800
If you don't go,

207
00:13:09,150 --> 00:13:10,630
I'll be all alone.

208
00:13:11,780 --> 00:13:14,270
There are so many boys in the basketball team.

209
00:13:14,270 --> 00:13:15,910
Why don't you just invite one of them?

210
00:13:15,910 --> 00:13:18,040
What if none of them agree to go with me?

211
00:13:19,720 --> 00:13:20,840
They?

212
00:13:23,200 --> 00:13:24,480
Mingxi,

213
00:13:24,960 --> 00:13:26,510
you're all I have.

214
00:13:29,910 --> 00:13:30,440
Alright.

215
00:13:32,370 --> 00:13:34,280
What clothes and shoes are you going to wear?

216
00:13:34,280 --> 00:13:36,040
We can match sister outfits.

217
00:13:37,440 --> 00:13:39,730
I can make the clothes myself,

218
00:13:40,150 --> 00:13:41,510
but as for the shoes...

219
00:13:42,120 --> 00:13:43,150
It's easy!

220
00:13:43,470 --> 00:13:44,470
You can wear mine.

221
00:13:45,480 --> 00:13:46,320
Your foot size is 36

222
00:13:46,320 --> 00:13:48,380
while mine is 38. How can I wear yours?

223
00:13:48,670 --> 00:13:49,570
If there is no better choice,

224
00:13:49,570 --> 00:13:50,700
I'll wear sneakers.

225
00:13:50,840 --> 00:13:51,910
Maybe

226
00:13:51,910 --> 00:13:54,240
I can spin a couple more times than others.

227
00:13:55,630 --> 00:13:56,390
Mingxi,

228
00:13:57,050 --> 00:13:59,380
can you help me pick out clothes and shoes?

229
00:13:59,390 --> 00:13:59,840
Sure.

230
00:14:00,030 --> 00:14:00,560
Let's go.

231
00:14:03,110 --> 00:14:03,640
Let's go.

232
00:14:10,400 --> 00:14:12,450
These are the ones I've picked out.

233
00:14:12,500 --> 00:14:13,960
Can you help me choose one?

234
00:14:14,930 --> 00:14:17,500
But I think they all look great.

235
00:14:18,670 --> 00:14:19,800
You must choose one.

236
00:14:21,630 --> 00:14:22,430
Then this one.

237
00:14:23,550 --> 00:14:25,530
What about the skirt with puff sleeves?

238
00:14:25,530 --> 00:14:26,800
Is it too formal?

239
00:14:27,480 --> 00:14:29,360
Attending a ball should be formal.

240
00:14:29,360 --> 00:14:31,490
You need to dress up beautifully, too.

241
00:14:31,510 --> 00:14:33,270
I've picked out these shoes,

242
00:14:33,550 --> 00:14:36,120
designed by my favorite FZ.

243
00:14:36,850 --> 00:14:37,920
Who's FZ?

244
00:14:38,550 --> 00:14:40,240
Fiona Zhang.

245
00:14:40,390 --> 00:14:41,790
She's currently the most

246
00:14:42,100 --> 00:14:43,900
famous domestic shoe designer.

247
00:14:46,390 --> 00:14:48,360
They all look so nice.

248
00:14:49,790 --> 00:14:50,920
These with diamonds

249
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:53,870
will sparkle under the lights.

250
00:14:54,630 --> 00:14:55,480
The pink ones

251
00:14:55,480 --> 00:14:56,610
are beautiful, too.

252
00:14:56,910 --> 00:14:58,840
I think these two pairs look good too.

253
00:14:58,840 --> 00:14:59,790
Well,

254
00:14:59,790 --> 00:15:01,200
I'll buy this pink pair.

255
00:15:01,440 --> 00:15:03,460
It matches the dress we just chose better.

256
00:15:03,460 --> 00:15:05,870
I'll buy the crystal shoes next time.

257
00:15:08,280 --> 00:15:10,440
But these crystal ones are amazing.

258
00:15:10,750 --> 00:15:11,320
Yes.

259
00:15:11,650 --> 00:15:13,200
I like this designer.

260
00:15:13,860 --> 00:15:14,860
What was her name?

261
00:15:15,550 --> 00:15:16,390
Fiona Zhang.

262
00:15:20,470 --> 00:15:23,930
You'd look attractive in these crystal shoes with a red dress.

263
00:15:24,270 --> 00:15:26,400
You'll be the most beautiful one then.

264
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:27,930
Just take a look.

265
00:15:27,960 --> 00:15:28,930
These shoes are too expensive.

266
00:15:28,930 --> 00:15:30,060
