You're

192
00:12:51,310 --> 00:12:52,980
not a teenager anymore.

193
00:12:53,270 --> 00:12:55,000
Yet you're still so impulsive.

194
00:12:56,600 --> 00:12:57,750
I told

195
00:12:57,880 --> 00:12:59,270
Yu Mingxi

196
00:12:59,960 --> 00:13:02,240
to focus on her studies now.

197
00:13:02,670 --> 00:13:04,870
But she didn't take my words seriously.

198
00:13:04,990 --> 00:13:06,450
Don't give her a hard time.

199
00:13:06,870 --> 00:13:09,840
Now, even Qin Siyao's mother knew her.

200
00:13:10,130 --> 00:13:11,860
Do I need to give her a hard time?

201
00:13:12,480 --> 00:13:13,720
No matter who it is,

202
00:13:14,800 --> 00:13:17,400
giving her a hard time means making me awkward.

203
00:13:18,150 --> 00:13:19,080
What do you mean?

204
00:13:19,630 --> 00:13:20,710
It means

205
00:13:24,260 --> 00:13:25,090
I like her.

206
00:13:28,570 --> 00:13:29,450
Jiang Bohan,

207
00:13:30,490 --> 00:13:31,720
are you serious?

208
00:13:33,670 --> 00:13:36,130
I'm going to express my love to her tomorrow.

209
00:13:42,950 --> 00:13:44,290
I finished the whole distance

210
00:13:44,290 --> 00:13:46,090
within twenty-one minutes and fifty-three seconds.

211
00:13:46,090 --> 00:13:47,020
You're amazing.

212
00:13:47,410 --> 00:13:49,340
You're running faster and faster.

213
00:13:50,600 --> 00:13:51,200
But,

214
00:13:51,200 --> 00:13:52,130
it's not enough.

215
00:13:52,670 --> 00:13:53,320
What's the big deal?

216
00:13:53,320 --> 00:13:54,580
Just keep practicing.

217
00:13:55,470 --> 00:13:57,400
The competition is coming up soon.

218
00:13:58,280 --> 00:13:58,880
Yu Mingxi,

219
00:14:01,100 --> 00:14:02,700
I have something to tell you.

220
00:14:04,340 --> 00:14:05,750
Can't it wait until after school?

221
00:14:05,750 --> 00:14:06,150
No.

222
00:14:07,050 --> 00:14:07,910
Then, go ahead.

223
00:14:08,310 --> 00:14:10,330
You said it wasn't you who wrote the love letter last time.

224
00:14:10,330 --> 00:14:11,390
Then, who wrote it?

225
00:14:16,040 --> 00:14:16,640
You did it?

226
00:14:17,640 --> 00:14:18,640
I don't remember.

227
00:14:19,040 --> 00:14:20,730
You have something to discuss with Mingxi, right?

228
00:14:20,730 --> 00:14:22,190
It's not proper for me to be here.

229
00:14:22,190 --> 00:14:23,190
I'll leave first.

230
00:14:24,010 --> 00:14:24,550
Wang Chunian,

231
00:14:24,550 --> 00:14:24,830
you…

232
00:14:28,960 --> 00:14:30,160
I've changed my mind.

233
00:14:30,550 --> 00:14:31,270
About what?

234
00:14:35,070 --> 00:14:35,870
I think we should

235
00:14:35,870 --> 00:14:37,000
not be friends anymore.

236
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:37,640
Why?

237
00:14:37,660 --> 00:14:39,460
Didn't we just agree yesterday?

238
00:14:41,490 --> 00:14:42,660
Because I like you.

239
00:14:42,860 --> 00:14:44,170

what did you do just now?

You saw it.

00:15:32,100 --> 00:15:33,340
