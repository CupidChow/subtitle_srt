00:00:45,320 --> 00:00:46,120
It's nothing.

12
00:00:46,350 --> 00:00:47,550
Just pulled a muscle.

13
00:00:47,820 --> 00:00:48,880
I'll be going then.

14
00:00:50,470 --> 00:00:51,930
Go back and have more rest.

Captain,

00:00:54,670 --> 00:00:56,110
I have a dinner date with a senior.

17
00:00:56,110 --> 00:00:57,170
I'm leaving first.

18
00:01:00,620 --> 00:01:01,680
You have plans too?

19
00:01:03,290 --> 00:01:03,820
Captain,

20
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:06,000
don't you have a date with Yu Mingxi today?

21
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:07,400
Stop gossiping about me.

22
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:09,200
That's not gossip.

23
00:01:09,480 --> 00:01:11,590
I'm just showing concern for my teammate.

24
00:01:11,590 --> 00:01:12,070
Do you know

25
00:01:12,070 --> 00:01:14,310
how Jie got together with Wang Chunian?

26
00:01:14,789 --> 00:01:15,400
Last time,

27
00:01:15,539 --> 00:01:18,270
Jie injured Wang Chunian's leg during training.

28
00:01:18,400 --> 00:01:19,890
I said Jie should take responsibility.

29
00:01:19,890 --> 00:01:20,480
And then?

30
00:01:20,640 --> 00:01:22,840
Jie accompanied her to the hospital every day.

31
00:01:22,840 --> 00:01:23,789
As time went on,

32
00:01:23,920 --> 00:01:26,180
they developed feelings for each other.

33
00:01:27,789 --> 00:01:30,050
I didn't see Wang Chunian's leg injured.

34
00:01:30,200 --> 00:01:31,180
Regardless of how it happened,

35
00:01:31,180 --> 00:01:32,710

I had basketball training today.

Basketball training.

Basketball training all the time!

I haven't seen you achieve anything remarkable!

Didn't we agree

Torn meniscus and ligament.

00:05:33,580 --> 00:05:34,510
you can scold me,

74
00:05:36,970 --> 00:05:38,500
but I must play in the match.

75
00:05:50,750 --> 00:05:53,680
You're in no position to negotiate with me right now.

76
00:06:19,920 --> 00:06:22,720

it's simply not possible.

Dr. Zhang,

82
00:06:33,310 --> 00:06:35,210
can you give me a nerve block injection?

83
00:06:35,210 --> 00:06:37,540
Although a nerve block can provide short-term

84
00:06:37,540 --> 00:06:39,000
pain relief and numbness,

85
00:06:39,360 --> 00:06:40,120
doing so

86
00:06:40,270 --> 00:06:42,040
could lead to a second injury

87
00:06:42,280 --> 00:06:44,010

88
00:06:44,240 --> 00:06:46,440
You're a professional athlete, right?

89
00:06:47,120 --> 00:06:48,830
Don't risk it for just one game.

90
00:06:48,830 --> 00:06:50,230
It will ruin your future.

91
00:06:52,480 --> 00:06:54,210
I'll play as many games as I can.

92
00:06:55,990 --> 00:06:57,320
You should reconsider.

93
00:06:57,620 --> 00:06:58,960
If you've made up your mind,

94
00:06:58,960 --> 00:07:00,820

It's okay.

00:07:13,600 --> 00:07:14,330
Don't worry.

Look, if I sell this little video,

117
00:08:57,800 --> 00:08:59,200
could I make extra money?

118
00:09:02,480 --> 00:09:03,390
Let me tell you,

119
00:09:03,440 --> 00:09:04,480
I know a guy

120
00:09:05,420 --> 00:09:07,480
who specifically collects these kinds of videos.

121
00:09:07,480 --> 00:09:08,120

00:09:08,150 --> 00:09:08,750

123
00:09:14,270 --> 00:09:14,750
Buddy.

124
00:09:15,590 --> 00:09:16,250
Got a light?

125
00:09:28,210 --> 00:09:29,740
I forgot my cigarettes too.

126
00:09:30,710 --> 00:09:31,640
What do you mean?

127
00:09:32,390 --> 00:09:34,200
I just overheard you guys talking about

128
00:09:34,200 --> 00:09:35,670
some video of a girl.

129
00:09:36,790 --> 00:09:37,850
Got anything good?

130
00:09:38,360 --> 00:09:39,490
Can I take a look too?

131
00:09:40,440 --> 00:09:41,480
There's no video.

132
00:09:41,560 --> 00:09:42,960

136
00:09:58,510 --> 00:09:59,440

138
00:10:06,530 --> 00:10:07,170

140
00:10:19,840 --> 00:10:21,300
It doesn't mean anything.

142
00:10:23,780 --> 00:10:24,910
You don't have a backup, huh?

143
00:10:24,910 --> 00:10:26,040
Don't worry, buddy.

144
00:10:26,130 --> 00:10:27,370
I know the rules.

145
00:11:00,220 --> 00:11:02,620
I hate people who use dirty tricks the most.

146

149
00:11:51,870 --> 00:11:53,270
Where did this come from?

150
00:11:54,940 --> 00:11:57,400
Yu Mingxi must have offended some lowlifes.

151
00:11:57,510 --> 00:11:58,440
These two people

152
00:11:58,440 --> 00:11:59,450
secretly recorded a video of her

153
00:11:59,450 --> 00:12:00,630
and were trying to blackmail her.

154
00:12:00,630 --> 00:12:02,560
I happened to catch them in the act.

155
00:12:03,790 --> 00:12:06,190
What kind of scumbags would do such a thing?

156
00:12:06,840 --> 00:12:08,970
Are you sure there are no other copies?

157
00:12:09,150 --> 00:12:10,210
I've confirmed it.

158
00:12:10,480 --> 00:12:11,680

159
00:12:12,340 --> 00:12:13,030
Then I'll destroy it.

Wait.

161
00:12:15,050 --> 00:12:15,510
What?

162
00:12:15,510 --> 00:12:16,970
Why are you injured again?

163
00:12:17,620 --> 00:12:19,420
They're much worse off than I am.

164
00:12:44,790 --> 00:12:45,850
What are you doing?

165
00:12:46,750 --> 00:12:48,810
Do you want everyone to see you naked?

166
00:12:48,850 --> 00:12:50,380

167
00:12:57,320 --> 00:12:58,240
What's this?

168
00:12:58,350 --> 00:12:59,350
Did you take this?

169
00:12:59,670 --> 00:13:02,530
When have I, Qin Siyao, ever used such dirty tricks?

170
00:13:02,940 --> 00:13:03,480
I don't know

171

who you've offended.

172
00:13:04,910 --> 00:13:07,790
These videos were bought from those people.

173
00:13:11,320 --> 00:13:13,520
So are you here to help me or threaten me?

174
00:13:14,150 --> 00:13:14,880
Don't worry.

175
00:13:15,840 --> 00:13:16,790

176
00:13:16,790 --> 00:13:17,600

177
00:13:18,480 --> 00:13:19,880
But I have one condition.

178
00:13:21,510 --> 00:13:22,440
What condition?

179
00:13:25,710 --> 00:13:28,440
You promise me you'll stop pursuing Jiang Bohan,

180
00:13:28,630 --> 00:13:30,960
and I'll completely delete these videos.

181
00:13:33,440 --> 00:13:35,700
You don't need to use this to threaten me.

182
00:13:36,630 --> 00:13:37,360
Don't worry.

183
00:13:37,750 --> 00:13:39,030
We won't be together.

184
00:13:41,480 --> 00:13:42,540
He's going abroad,

185
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:44,270
and I'm staying here.

186
00:13:46,030 --> 00:13:48,090
How can you be so sure he'll go abroad?

187
00:13:50,750 --> 00:13:51,410
Because...

188
00:13:52,640 --> 00:13:54,550
he promised to go with me before.

189
00:13:56,440 --> 00:13:58,570
I hope you can help me keep this secret.

190
00:14:02,750 --> 00:14:04,350
You're going to deceive him?

191
00:14:05,500 --> 00:14:07,360
He'll never forgive you for this.

192
00:14:12,200 --> 00:14:13,730
It doesn't matter anymore.

194
00:16:13,960 --> 00:16:14,630
Corn,

195
00:16:14,630 --> 00:16:15,360
I'm back.

196
00:16:25,550 --> 00:16:26,750
Why are you standing?

197
00:16:28,270 --> 00:16:28,800
Nothing.

198
00:16:30,670 --> 00:16:31,400
It's just...

199
00:16:32,440 --> 00:16:34,700
the shoes I lost a few days ago are broken.

200
00:16:35,030 --> 00:16:35,640
Broken?

201
00:16:41,550 --> 00:16:42,140
It's okay.

202
00:16:42,140 --> 00:16:43,550
They have a 30-day warranty.

203
00:16:43,550 --> 00:16:45,280
I can take them back for repair.

204
00:16:48,200 --> 00:16:49,200
How do you know

205
00:16:49,630 --> 00:16:50,960
the warranty is 30 days?

206
00:16:54,530 --> 00:16:58,290
Such expensive shoes usually have a 30-day warranty.

207
00:17:00,150 --> 00:17:01,480
Did you buy these shoes?

208
00:17:02,960 --> 00:17:03,750
Are you kidding?

209
00:17:03,750 --> 00:17:05,030
These shoes are so expensive.

210
00:17:05,030 --> 00:17:06,359
How could I afford them?

211
00:17:06,400 --> 00:17:07,460
You're lying to me!

212
00:17:12,810 --> 00:17:14,270
I didn't mean to deceive you.

213
00:17:14,270 --> 00:17:16,440
I just wanted you to look

214
00:17:17,200 --> 00:17:18,069
beautiful at the prom

215
00:17:18,069 --> 00:17:19,270
and to make you happy.

216
00:17:19,440 --> 00:17:20,240
These shoes are so expensive.

217
00:17:20,240 --> 00:17:21,770
Where did you get the money?

218
00:17:22,240 --> 00:17:22,960
And,

219
00:17:23,310 --> 00:17:25,680
what happened when you fought with Jiang Bohan last time?

220
00:17:25,680 --> 00:17:27,280
What were you hiding from me?

221
00:17:27,349 --> 00:17:28,160
I...

222
00:17:29,880 --> 00:17:31,590
I still have some small savings.

223
00:17:31,590 --> 00:17:32,510
You Jingchu!

224
00:17:34,030 --> 00:17:34,830
What's wrong?

225
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:41,720
I'm sorry.

226
00:17:42,030 --> 00:17:43,030
I didn't mean to.

227
00:17:43,440 --> 00:17:44,170
Are you okay?

228
00:17:45,680 --> 00:17:46,480
It wasn't you.

229
00:17:47,590 --> 00:17:50,270
I was just too clumsy when I was sparring a few days ago

230
00:17:50,270 --> 00:17:52,000
and accidentally hit a pillar.

231
00:17:52,520 --> 00:17:53,980
It'll be fine in a few days.

232
00:17:56,590 --> 00:17:58,990
You went to be someone's sparring partner?

233
00:18:02,800 --> 00:18:03,320
I...

234
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:08,350
Corn.
