1
00:00:12,690 --> 00:00:13,350
Be careful!

2
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:23,060
Can you be careful?

3
00:00:24,960 --> 00:00:26,440
You're here.

4
00:00:35,080 --> 00:00:35,610
Let's go.

5
00:00:38,170 --> 00:00:39,430
What do you want to eat?

6
00:00:45,840 --> 00:00:47,560
It's not like we're doing anything shady.

7
00:00:47,560 --> 00:00:49,220
The less trouble, the better.

8
00:00:54,960 --> 00:00:55,640
I'm hungry.

9
00:00:55,880 --> 00:00:56,320
Let's go.

10
00:00:56,320 --> 00:00:57,200
Have a sausage.

11
00:00:59,500 --> 00:01:00,110
Don't go.

12
00:01:00,670 --> 00:01:01,150
Why?

13
00:01:02,350 --> 00:01:04,510
I'll take you to eat something delicious.

14
00:01:04,510 --> 00:01:04,989
Okay.

15
00:01:05,129 --> 00:01:05,660
Let's go.

16
00:02:13,270 --> 00:02:16,120
[Close to You]

17
00:02:16,250 --> 00:02:18,640
[Episode 11, Hello, Mr Jiang.]

18
00:02:26,690 --> 00:02:28,430
This restaurant looks expensive.

19
00:02:28,430 --> 00:02:30,230
Let's go to another restaurant.

20
00:02:31,910 --> 00:02:33,040
It's my treat today.

21
00:02:33,800 --> 00:02:34,980
You help me with my tutoring.

22
00:02:34,980 --> 00:02:36,500
I should treat you.

23
00:02:37,630 --> 00:02:38,230
Next time.

24
00:02:39,030 --> 00:02:41,360
I just want to take you to this restaurant.

25
00:02:57,770 --> 00:02:59,560
This is complimentary bread

26
00:03:00,360 --> 00:03:01,820
and black truffle butter.

27
00:03:02,150 --> 00:03:02,950
Please enjoy.

28
00:03:03,630 --> 00:03:04,230
Thank you.

29
00:03:21,910 --> 00:03:22,640
Jiang Bohan,

30
00:03:22,710 --> 00:03:24,030
you don't have to be so nice to me.

31
00:03:24,030 --> 00:03:24,960
Your mother is not here.

32
00:03:24,960 --> 00:03:27,220
It's not like you can annoy her with this.

33
00:03:27,560 --> 00:03:28,890
Then I'll call her over.

34
00:03:29,150 --> 00:03:30,470
That's not necessary.

35
00:03:31,390 --> 00:03:33,590
Boys being rebellious is really scary.

36
00:03:34,520 --> 00:03:36,050
My relationship with my mom

37
00:03:36,710 --> 00:03:39,110
was already like this before you showed up.

38
00:03:40,590 --> 00:03:41,850
It won't get any worse,

39
00:03:43,170 --> 00:03:44,700
and it won't get any better.

40
00:03:44,910 --> 00:03:45,630
But

41
00:03:45,960 --> 00:03:48,290
I don't want you two to argue because of me.

42
00:03:49,120 --> 00:03:50,360
You're overthinking it.

43
00:03:50,360 --> 00:03:51,590
How am I overthinking?

44
00:03:51,590 --> 00:03:52,470
She's your mom.

45
00:03:54,280 --> 00:03:55,740
Are you going to eat or not?

46
00:03:57,380 --> 00:03:58,450
If I eat too much bread,

47
00:03:58,450 --> 00:03:59,040
I won't have room

48
00:03:59,040 --> 00:04:00,500
for the main course later.

49
00:04:01,470 --> 00:04:04,870
You can really judge the quality of a restaurant by its bread.

50
00:04:21,360 --> 00:04:23,000
This is your medium-rare

51
00:04:23,160 --> 00:04:23,960
filet mignon,

52
00:04:23,970 --> 00:04:25,970
topped with ten-year-aged caviar.

53
00:04:26,160 --> 00:04:27,090
Okay, thank you.

54
00:05:05,950 --> 00:05:06,360
Try it.

55
00:05:07,430 --> 00:05:08,560
It looks different.

56
00:05:30,270 --> 00:05:30,720
Try it.

57
00:05:32,840 --> 00:05:33,840
Just a small bite.

58
00:05:34,480 --> 00:05:35,409
What do you want?

59
00:05:36,050 --> 00:05:37,190
I was just quoting.

60
00:05:38,610 --> 00:05:41,070
That was my first time writing a love letter.

61
00:05:41,490 --> 00:05:42,490
Then I'm honored.

62
00:05:42,830 --> 00:05:44,760
But it was actually for Nian.

63
00:05:44,780 --> 00:05:46,480
I put a lot of effort into it.

64
00:05:50,510 --> 00:05:52,000
The writing was pretty good.

65
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:53,170
You almost moved me.

66
00:05:53,800 --> 00:05:55,400
Who could possibly move you?

67
00:05:55,530 --> 00:05:56,700
You've got a heart of stone.

68
00:05:56,700 --> 00:05:59,030
Aren't you the one with the heart of stone?

69
00:06:05,430 --> 00:06:06,760
Aren't you going to eat?

70
00:06:40,310 --> 00:06:40,720
Thank you,

71
00:06:40,720 --> 00:06:41,430
Jiang Bohan.

72
00:06:41,430 --> 00:06:42,180
You're welcome,

73
00:06:42,180 --> 00:06:42,780
Yu Mingxi.

74
00:06:43,430 --> 00:06:45,920
If my grades improve in the midterms,

75
00:06:46,120 --> 00:06:48,050
then your debt to me will be repaid.

76
00:06:51,080 --> 00:06:53,010
And what if I don't want to repay it?

77
00:06:54,680 --> 00:06:55,120
What?

78
00:06:58,190 --> 00:06:58,600
Fine.

79
00:06:59,720 --> 00:07:01,240
Even if I repay my debt,

80
00:07:02,370 --> 00:07:03,310
then next,

81
00:07:04,830 --> 00:07:06,160
it's your turn to owe me.

82
00:07:07,070 --> 00:07:08,070
What do I owe you?

83
00:07:08,680 --> 00:07:09,310
Don't you know

84
00:07:09,310 --> 00:07:10,170
what you owe me?

85
00:07:25,790 --> 00:07:26,450
Think about it slowly,

86
00:07:26,450 --> 00:07:27,080
kid.

87
00:07:37,270 --> 00:07:37,930
Wait for me!

88
00:07:38,470 --> 00:07:39,150
Crush:

89
00:07:39,300 --> 00:07:40,880
enlighten, ardor.

90
00:07:41,340 --> 00:07:42,550
Anticipate:

91
00:07:42,830 --> 00:07:43,890
to look forward to,

92
00:07:44,070 --> 00:07:44,870
to hope for.

93
00:07:45,270 --> 00:07:46,240
Infatuation:

94
00:07:46,800 --> 00:07:48,130
passionate obsession,

95
00:07:48,390 --> 00:07:49,390
deep attraction.

96
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:58,730
Today's mission is fulfilled.

97
00:07:59,430 --> 00:08:00,560
Good memorization.

98
00:08:00,680 --> 00:08:02,010
I'll test you tomorrow.

99
00:08:02,310 --> 00:08:02,800
Thank you,

100
00:08:02,800 --> 00:08:03,530
Jiang Bohan,

101
00:08:03,750 --> 00:08:04,950
for treating me to a meal today

102
00:08:04,950 --> 00:08:06,680
and even accompanying me home.

103
00:08:07,830 --> 00:08:09,360
I've taught you for so long,

104
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:12,130
and you're still calling me by my name.

105
00:08:12,310 --> 00:08:13,840
What else should I call you?

106
00:08:14,190 --> 00:08:15,390
Are you playing dumb?

107
00:08:16,650 --> 00:08:17,650
Call me Mr. Jiang.

108
00:08:24,600 --> 00:08:25,600
Call me Mr. Jiang.

109
00:08:30,600 --> 00:08:31,830
Mr. Jiang.

110
00:08:33,640 --> 00:08:34,770
That's more like it.

111
00:08:36,590 --> 00:08:37,390
Call it again.

112
00:08:39,909 --> 00:08:41,270
Mr. Jiang.

113
00:08:43,630 --> 00:08:46,160
You can't force someone to call you Mr. Jiang.

114
00:08:47,240 --> 00:08:48,000
Jiang Bohan.

115
00:08:49,390 --> 00:08:50,120
Jiang Bohan!

116
00:08:50,240 --> 00:08:51,270
Jiang Bohan!

117
00:08:54,630 --> 00:08:55,150
Stop!

118
00:08:55,330 --> 00:08:55,950
Don't run.

119
00:08:55,970 --> 00:08:59,330
Jiang Bohan!

120
00:09:36,080 --> 00:09:36,610
Alright.

121
00:09:39,270 --> 00:09:41,870
The sun will set if you don't come out.

122
00:09:42,550 --> 00:09:44,480
I've worked hard for five hours.

123
00:09:44,630 --> 00:09:45,720
I didn't slack off.

124
00:09:46,840 --> 00:09:47,970
What flavor is this?

125
00:09:48,020 --> 00:09:49,440
I really have good luck with food.

126
00:09:49,440 --> 00:09:50,290
The one you like the most—

127
00:09:50,290 --> 00:09:51,350
blueberry cheese.

128
00:09:52,720 --> 00:09:54,630
So when it's my birthday,

129
00:09:55,180 --> 00:09:56,980
I should get the same treatment.

130
00:09:57,770 --> 00:09:59,200
I need to think about it.

131
00:09:59,430 --> 00:10:01,330
You little brat, what are you talking about?

132
00:10:01,330 --> 00:10:01,930
I dare not.

133
00:10:02,400 --> 00:10:03,060
Make a wish.

134
00:10:03,060 --> 00:10:03,720
Make a wish.

135
00:10:05,980 --> 00:10:06,710
This will do.

136
00:10:11,790 --> 00:10:12,390
Come here.

137
00:10:14,240 --> 00:10:15,240
Close your eyes.

138
00:10:16,410 --> 00:10:18,050
Why should we close our eyes if you make a wish?

139
00:10:18,050 --> 00:10:18,580
Exactly.

140
00:10:19,160 --> 00:10:20,480

00:12:30,360 --> 00:12:31,760
I need to watch my weight.

194
00:12:33,360 --> 00:12:34,120
Alright,

195
00:12:34,120 --> 00:12:35,080
no cake then.

196
00:12:35,910 --> 00:12:36,710
Yan Zhengwen,

197
00:12:37,140 --> 00:12:39,400
keep an eye on Yu Mingxi for me these days.

198
00:12:39,750 --> 00:12:40,320
Got it.

199
00:12:40,340 --> 00:12:42,980
[Special Event for the Anniversary]

200
00:12:46,160 --> 00:12:47,310
So that.

201
00:12:49,220 --> 00:12:50,220
Make sure.

202
00:12:54,120 --> 00:12:54,910
Yu Mingxi!

203
00:13:00,480 --> 00:13:03,480
Here's your chemistry, history, and geography work.

204
00:13:03,500 --> 00:13:04,100
Thank you.

205
00:13:05,720 --> 00:13:07,000
Call me Mr. Jiang.

206
00:13:07,670 --> 00:13:08,400
Give it to me.

207
00:13:08,840 --> 00:13:09,570
Give it to me!

208
00:13:10,680 --> 00:13:12,280
Are you giving it to me or not?

209
00:13:18,780 --> 00:13:19,510
Here you are.

210
00:13:21,800 --> 00:13:22,360
Thank you.

211
00:13:22,360 --> 00:13:23,360
I'm leaving. Bye.

212
00:13:30,180 --> 00:13:31,380
Let's go, Uncle Chen.

213
00:13:37,600 --> 00:13:38,390
Come on.

214
00:13:38,390 --> 00:13:39,870
Let me see.

215
00:13:50,010 --> 00:13:51,230
Sweet.

216
00:13:55,030 --> 00:13:57,360
I can't let Yaoyao see Jiang Bohan's face.

217
00:14:03,440 --> 00:14:04,890
This one must not work.

218
00:14:09,030 --> 00:14:09,760
You're here.

219
00:14:11,390 --> 00:14:12,320
What do you want?

220
00:14:14,370 --> 00:14:16,090
I have a gift for you.

221
00:14:16,480 --> 00:14:17,200
What gift?

222
00:14:24,350 --> 00:14:25,030
Look.

223
00:14:33,750 --> 00:14:34,630
You are right.

224
00:14:36,120 --> 00:14:37,850
Yu Mingxi is really something.

225
00:14:41,750 --> 00:14:43,460
I have a birthday wish.

226
00:14:45,440 --> 00:14:46,250
What?

227
00:14:46,830 --> 00:14:48,490
I want Yu Mingxi to disappear.

228
00:14:53,020 --> 00:14:54,150
It's not difficult.

229
00:14:55,200 --> 00:14:56,600
But I have one condition.

230
00:14:59,470 --> 00:15:00,000
Go ahead.

231
00:15:01,080 --> 00:15:03,540
You have to be willing to give up Jiang Bohan.

232
00:15:05,550 --> 00:15:06,480
What do you mean?

233
00:15:07,790 --> 00:15:09,320
Are you willing or not?

234
00:15:23,550 --> 00:15:24,320
Mingxi,

235
00:15:24,340 --> 00:15:25,080
you're finally here.

236
00:15:25,080 --> 00:15:26,080
Something bad happened.

237
00:15:26,080 --> 00:15:26,880
What's wrong?

238
00:15:27,440 --> 00:15:29,100
Did your creditor come to you?

239
00:15:29,480 --> 00:15:29,910
What?

240
00:15:30,270 --> 00:15:30,750
Look.

241
00:15:32,880 --> 00:15:34,600
It's said online that you're adopted.

242
00:15:34,600 --> 00:15:35,840
Who's in the car?

243
00:15:51,550 --> 00:15:52,810
She must be suspended.

244
00:15:55,020 --> 00:15:57,280
You're suspending her over a few photos?

245
00:15:57,750 --> 00:15:59,350
That's totally over the top.

246
00:15:59,670 --> 00:16:01,390
Besides, exams are next week.

247
00:16:01,670 --> 00:16:02,840
Suspending her now

248
00:16:02,840 --> 00:16:04,910
would seriously affect her.

249
00:16:06,270 --> 00:16:08,730
And you don't think this affects the school?

250
00:16:09,750 --> 00:16:11,550
We're in the age of social media—

251
00:16:11,670 --> 00:16:13,360
the media loves to twist things

252
00:16:13,360 --> 00:16:14,360
and stir up drama.

253
00:16:16,360 --> 00:16:19,290
If the school doesn't take action, doesn't respond,

254
00:16:19,790 --> 00:16:22,020
how do you think the media will report it?

255
00:16:22,020 --> 00:16:23,620
What will the parents think?

256
00:16:25,010 --> 00:16:27,510
This is a critical time for student admissions—

257
00:16:27,510 --> 00:16:28,200
can you

258
00:16:28,980 --> 00:16:31,710
take full responsibility for the consequences?

259
00:16:31,760 --> 00:16:33,290
I believe in her character.

260
00:16:33,790 --> 00:16:35,120
We'll know exactly what happened

261
00:16:35,120 --> 00:16:35,960
once she gets here

262
00:16:35,960 --> 00:16:37,120
and we ask her.

263
00:16:37,600 --> 00:16:40,270
I'll have the PR department issue a statement

264
00:16:40,490 --> 00:16:41,920
to clarify the facts.

265
00:16:43,240 --> 00:16:45,080
Do you know her outside school?

266
00:16:45,080 --> 00:16:47,280
And yet you're defending her like this?

267
00:16:50,740 --> 00:16:52,470
I forgot to tell you something.

268
00:16:52,950 --> 00:16:55,200
Last time, when Jiang Bohan got into that fight,

269
00:16:55,200 --> 00:16:58,330
I had someone take the video down from the trending list,

270
00:16:58,460 --> 00:17:01,910
but she was in that video too.

271
00:17:02,910 --> 00:17:06,000
What does that have to do with this?

272
00:17:06,470 --> 00:17:08,800
Don't you understand what I said?

273
00:17:09,530 --> 00:17:12,099
Yu Mingxi does not represent Jingcai College.

274
00:17:12,099 --> 00:17:15,200
This is the image Jingcai College has in the public eye right now.

275
00:17:15,200 --> 00:17:17,530
She has to be suspended and investigated.

276
00:17:17,880 --> 00:17:18,540
Otherwise,

277
00:17:20,510 --> 00:17:22,920
I won't be able to keep Jiang Bohan's incident

278
00:17:22,920 --> 00:17:24,240
under wraps either.

279
00:17:28,610 --> 00:17:30,670
If this is the only way to satisfy you,

280
00:17:31,820 --> 00:17:32,580
then so be it.

281
00:17:44,790 --> 00:17:45,720
What's going on?

282
00:17:46,140 --> 00:17:47,430
Headmistress, trust me.

283
00:17:47,430 --> 00:17:48,590
I'm not being kept.

284
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:49,880
I trust you.

285
00:17:50,420 --> 00:17:52,550
But you have to tell me the whole story.

286
00:17:52,790 --> 00:17:54,390
Who was the person in the car?

287
00:17:55,720 --> 00:17:56,650
I can't tell you.

288
00:17:57,240 --> 00:17:57,920
Why?

289
00:17:58,990 --> 00:18:00,520
Because I don't want to lie.

290
00:18:00,520 --> 00:18:01,970
If you don't tell me the truth,

291
00:18:01,970 --> 00:18:03,570
how am I supposed to help you?

292
00:18:07,950 --> 00:18:09,280
Since you refuse to say,

293
00:18:09,920 --> 00:18:12,250
the school will have to follow procedure.

294
00:18:12,550 --> 00:18:14,160
You'll be suspended for a week.

295
00:18:14,160 --> 00:18:15,350
Once everything is cleared up,

296
00:18:15,350 --> 00:18:16,680
you can return to class.

297
00:18:16,880 --> 00:18:17,400
But

298
00:18:17,550 --> 00:18:18,160
if I'm suspended,

299
00:18:18,160 --> 00:18:19,830
I won't be able to take the midterm exam.

300
00:18:19,830 --> 00:18:21,340
What about the scholarship?

301
00:18:21,340 --> 00:18:24,480
Jingcai College cares most about its reputation and public image.

302
00:18:24,480 --> 00:18:26,160
It's the board putting pressure on me

303
00:18:26,160 --> 00:18:27,070
to suspend you.

304
00:18:27,590 --> 00:18:28,640
Not to the mention scholarship,

305
00:18:28,640 --> 00:18:31,300
whether you can go to school or not is uncertain.

306
00:18:46,240 --> 00:18:47,570
No need to keep looking.

307
00:18:48,310 --> 00:18:49,550
I'm the one who raised her.
