00:12:22,630 --> 00:12:24,160
I need to ask you something.

193
00:12:25,190 --> 00:12:26,990
Why is Yu Mingxi afraid of water?

194
00:12:29,770 --> 00:12:30,570
It's a secret.

195
00:12:35,840 --> 00:12:36,840
You won't tell me?

196
00:12:37,540 --> 00:12:38,120
If you won't tell me,

197
00:12:38,120 --> 00:12:39,250
I'll ask her myself.

198
00:12:43,690 --> 00:12:44,480
Let's talk.

199
00:12:54,480 --> 00:12:55,270
Uncle

200
00:12:56,540 --> 00:12:57,690
drowned while

201
00:12:58,680 --> 00:13:00,010
trying to save someone.

202
00:13:01,400 --> 00:13:03,130
Why didn't you tell me earlier?

203
00:13:03,320 --> 00:13:04,520
Why should I tell you?

204
00:13:08,670 --> 00:13:10,600
How long are you going to stay here?

205
00:13:12,750 --> 00:13:14,320
I should be asking you that.

206
00:13:14,600 --> 00:13:16,240
How long are you staying?

207
00:13:16,580 --> 00:13:16,960
I...

208
00:13:20,230 --> 00:13:22,060
I've already told you everything.

209
00:13:22,060 --> 00:13:22,660
Leave now.

210
00:13:24,520 --> 00:13:25,150
Fine.

211
00:13:34,710 --> 00:13:36,500
I don't know how to open the door.

212
00:13:36,500 --> 00:13:37,300
Open it for me.

213
00:13:37,960 --> 00:13:39,270
So troublesome.

214
00:13:48,730 --> 00:13:49,270
What?

215
00:13:50,240 --> 00:13:51,100
Get some sleep.

216
00:13:53,720 --> 00:13:54,980
You're sleeping here?

217
00:13:55,400 --> 00:13:57,530
It's not safe to go back alone at night.

218
00:13:57,770 --> 00:13:58,170
Get up.

219
00:13:58,280 --> 00:13:59,340
I'll take you home.

220
00:13:59,670 --> 00:14:00,270
I'm tired.

221
00:14:00,440 --> 00:14:01,170
I can't walk.

222
00:14:01,280 --> 00:14:02,680
You have to carry me back.

223
00:14:04,170 --> 00:14:04,690
What?

224
00:14:05,140 --> 00:14:06,000
If you sleep here,

225
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:06,930
where do I sleep?

226
00:14:07,200 --> 00:14:08,030
Anywhere.

227
00:14:08,050 --> 00:14:09,240
You don't need to ask for my permission.

228
00:14:09,240 --> 00:14:10,120
Find your own spot.

229
00:14:10,120 --> 00:14:10,670
Be quiet.

230
00:14:14,540 --> 00:14:15,770
I'm sleeping on the couch too.

231
00:14:15,770 --> 00:14:16,280
Move.

232
00:14:18,220 --> 00:14:18,720
Get up.

233
00:15:10,120 --> 00:15:11,150
Good morning.

234
00:15:28,700 --> 00:15:29,150
Here.

235
00:15:30,410 --> 00:15:31,010
Thank you.

236
00:15:42,230 --> 00:15:43,660
Shrimp wonton noodles.

237
00:15:46,150 --> 00:15:48,680
You didn't even know that she hates cilantro.

238
00:15:49,710 --> 00:15:51,510
It's not too late to find out now.

239
00:15:53,770 --> 00:15:54,800
I'll eat it.

240
00:16:01,240 --> 00:16:02,100
Barbecue pork.

241
00:16:02,730 --> 00:16:05,390
You didn't even know she doesn't eat fatty meat.

242
00:16:11,510 --> 00:16:12,570
Shrimp dumplings?

243
00:16:12,970 --> 00:16:13,770
Of course not.

244
00:16:14,490 --> 00:16:16,730
You didn't even know I don't eat shrimp dumplings.

245
00:16:16,730 --> 00:16:18,750
What does whether you eat them have to do with me?

246
00:16:18,750 --> 00:16:20,140
Are you looking for trouble?

247
00:16:20,140 --> 00:16:21,120
Don't listen to him.

248
00:16:21,120 --> 00:16:21,930
I eat everything.

249
00:16:21,930 --> 00:16:22,730
I'm not picky.

250
00:16:25,090 --> 00:16:27,150
I really don't eat shrimp dumplings.

251
00:16:31,630 --> 00:16:32,230
By the way,

252
00:16:32,870 --> 00:16:33,720
we'll

253
00:16:33,840 --> 00:16:34,600
go out later.

254
00:16:36,060 --> 00:16:36,950
-We?
-We?

255
00:16:40,140 --> 00:16:44,150
[Close to You]
