1
00:00:10,480 --> 00:00:11,480
Look at yourself.

2
00:00:11,980 --> 00:00:13,780
What did you play at the concert?

3
00:00:14,080 --> 00:00:16,309
Secretly changing the piece is one thing,

4
00:00:16,309 --> 00:00:18,390
but getting drunk and causing a scene at Jiang Bohan's house?

5
00:00:18,390 --> 00:00:21,390
Don't you think you've embarrassed yourself enough?

6
00:00:34,800 --> 00:00:36,470
Yao won't be going to school today.

7
00:00:36,470 --> 00:00:37,370
You don't need to take her.

8
00:00:37,370 --> 00:00:39,830
Let her stay home and reflect on her actions.

9
00:01:04,220 --> 00:01:05,250
Who let you in?

10
00:01:06,100 --> 00:01:06,560
Get out!

11
00:01:10,570 --> 00:01:12,030
Does your head still hurt?

12
00:01:13,760 --> 00:01:15,289
It's none of your business.

13
00:01:17,200 --> 00:01:19,670
I bought your favorite rock sugar bird's nest.

14
00:01:19,670 --> 00:01:20,870
Remember to drink it.

15
00:01:27,240 --> 00:01:28,039
Yan Zhengwen.

16
00:01:33,140 --> 00:01:34,070
I'm not leaving.

17
00:01:49,300 --> 00:01:51,710
Please don't be with Yu Mingxi, okay?

18
00:01:56,229 --> 00:01:59,150
Can you please not be with Yu Mingxi?

19
00:02:08,310 --> 00:02:09,009
I'm hungry.

20
00:02:11,030 --> 00:02:11,750
Let's eat.

21
00:02:14,250 --> 00:02:15,710
Look what I bought for you.

22
00:02:22,700 --> 00:02:24,030
Drink it while it's hot.

23
00:02:28,270 --> 00:02:29,800
When I got drunk last night,

24
00:02:30,079 --> 00:02:31,290
did I say anything?

25
00:02:32,680 --> 00:02:33,610
What did you say?

26
00:02:34,340 --> 00:02:35,600
I didn't say anything?

27
00:02:36,070 --> 00:02:36,660
No.

28
00:02:36,960 --> 00:02:38,430
You drank too much yesterday.

29
00:02:38,430 --> 00:02:39,190
You slept

30
00:02:39,740 --> 00:02:40,470
very quietly

31
00:02:40,920 --> 00:02:41,780
and so soundly.

32
00:02:43,750 --> 00:02:44,880
And I didn't cry too?

33
00:02:46,750 --> 00:02:47,400
You...

34
00:02:47,850 --> 00:02:49,800
didn't cry.

35
00:02:52,490 --> 00:02:53,800
My mom said I cried the whole time,

36
00:02:53,800 --> 00:02:55,630
screaming like a lunatic.

37
00:02:59,480 --> 00:03:00,200
Is that so?

38
00:03:01,490 --> 00:03:02,220
I had no idea.

39
00:03:04,690 --> 00:03:05,750
Give me your phone.

40
00:03:06,910 --> 00:03:07,430
Why?

41
00:03:08,270 --> 00:03:10,400
To see if you took any ugly photos of me.

42
00:03:11,590 --> 00:03:13,320
In my heart, you're never ugly.

43
00:03:16,190 --> 00:03:17,590
What's the point of that?

44
00:03:26,450 --> 00:03:28,450
Next time you want to drink, call me.

45
00:03:28,860 --> 00:03:30,120
I'll keep you company.

00:03:48,050 --> 00:03:49,579
can you do something for me?

48
00:03:50,900 --> 00:03:51,470
Sure.

I'm going the same way.

I'm going to work.

00:06:18,370 --> 00:06:20,230
are you an ostrich or just stupid?

00:07:52,990 --> 00:07:53,650
No, I'm not.

103
00:07:56,440 --> 00:07:57,700
I have a heart of stone.

104
00:07:59,159 --> 00:08:00,520
You're so young.

105
00:08:00,760 --> 00:08:02,960
Have you been through some rough times?

106
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:07,260
Why aren't you eating?

107
00:08:10,270 --> 00:08:11,830
Why do you always like to eat

108
00:08:11,830 --> 00:08:12,870
these junk food?

109
00:08:13,200 --> 00:08:14,480
How are these junk food?

110
00:08:14,480 --> 00:08:16,280
I even ordered some vegetables.

111
00:08:17,310 --> 00:08:18,040
High in salt,

112
00:08:18,340 --> 00:08:19,140
high in sugar,

113
00:08:19,960 --> 00:08:20,720
high in fat.

114
00:08:20,760 --> 00:08:22,140
How are these not junk food?

115
00:08:22,140 --> 00:08:23,500
But it's really delicious.

116
00:08:23,500 --> 00:08:24,210
Try it.

117
00:08:27,100 --> 00:08:28,230
Come on, just try it.

118
00:08:29,360 --> 00:08:30,560
Really, have a taste.

119
00:08:43,320 --> 00:08:44,039
How is it?

120
00:08:44,130 --> 00:08:45,260
Isn't it delicious?

121
00:08:48,390 --> 00:08:49,190
It's alright.

122
00:08:49,560 --> 00:08:51,110
How can that be?

123
00:08:51,270 --> 00:08:52,640
This is the best street food

124
00:08:52,640 --> 00:08:54,280
within a two-kilometer radius.

125
00:08:54,280 --> 00:08:55,840
I don't usually treat people,

126
00:08:55,840 --> 00:08:57,870
but this whole table of food only costs 30 yuan.

127
00:08:57,870 --> 00:08:59,700
It's economical and delicious.

128
00:08:59,980 --> 00:09:01,840
You're quite easy to buy off then.

129
00:09:03,580 --> 00:09:05,580
But why did you transfer schools?

130
00:09:05,600 --> 00:09:08,400
Did you make some mistake at your previous school?

131
00:09:08,510 --> 00:09:09,510
Of course not.

132
00:09:10,610 --> 00:09:11,200
My dad

133
00:09:11,200 --> 00:09:13,420
used to be the swimming coach at Jingcai College.

134
00:09:13,420 --> 00:09:15,460
To honor his act of bravery, the school

135
00:09:15,460 --> 00:09:16,760
made an exception to admit me.

136
00:09:16,760 --> 00:09:18,520
They even waived my tuition fees.

137
00:09:18,520 --> 00:09:19,920
So that's why I came here.

138
00:09:23,130 --> 00:09:26,000
Then why are you still working at a convenience store?

139
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:26,630
It's because

140
00:09:26,630 --> 00:09:28,690
there are always school activities,

141
00:09:29,050 --> 00:09:31,200
and my mom alone can't afford to support me.

142
00:09:31,200 --> 00:09:33,600
So I have to work part-time while studying.

143
00:09:34,910 --> 00:09:37,040
But it's okay, I have a lot of free time,

144
00:09:37,390 --> 00:09:38,840
so I can still make money.

145
00:09:43,580 --> 00:09:48,150
Is that discount at your convenience store still valid?

146
00:09:48,540 --> 00:09:49,140
Yes, it is.

147
00:09:50,790 --> 00:09:51,520
You saw it?

148
00:09:52,960 --> 00:09:54,890
Like I said, persistence pays off.

149
00:09:57,100 --> 00:09:58,500
What you did is called...

150
00:10:00,490 --> 00:10:01,690
relentless pursuit.

151
00:10:02,110 --> 00:10:03,030
Me?

152
00:10:03,060 --> 00:10:05,080
What you did at the convenience store today was...

153
00:10:05,080 --> 00:10:06,240
What did I do?

154
00:10:07,400 --> 00:10:09,260
What you did is called pestering.

155
00:10:15,600 --> 00:10:16,730
Where are you going?

156
00:10:18,800 --> 00:10:19,590
Pestering.

157
00:10:44,300 --> 00:10:45,500
Is this what you meant by

158
00:10:45,500 --> 00:10:46,470
buying a little?

159
00:10:47,200 --> 00:10:48,530
Nothing here is on sale.

160
00:11:07,170 --> 00:11:08,230

00:11:23,740 --> 00:11:24,800

Okay.

193
00:12:41,170 --> 00:12:42,910
You got away with it last time.

194
00:12:43,800 --> 00:12:45,800
You think you can run away this time?

195
00:12:50,690 --> 00:12:51,550
Jiang Bohan.

196
00:12:52,520 --> 00:12:53,850
What are you guys doing?

197
00:12:57,910 --> 00:13:00,200
Just chatting with some friends.

198
00:13:00,220 --> 00:13:01,950
It's none of your business. Go.

199
00:13:09,270 --> 00:13:10,400
What a coincidence.

200
00:13:10,610 --> 00:13:12,910
I was just looking for your little girlfriend.

201
00:13:12,910 --> 00:13:13,550
Me?

202
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:14,550
Yes,

203
00:13:14,970 --> 00:13:15,640
you.

204
00:13:16,450 --> 00:13:18,060
What are you doing?

205
00:13:18,420 --> 00:13:19,550
Are you going to fight again?

206
00:13:19,550 --> 00:13:20,880
I'm calling the police.

207
00:13:23,520 --> 00:13:24,920
What do you want with her?

208
00:13:25,330 --> 00:13:26,590
Why are you so nervous?

209
00:13:27,330 --> 00:13:28,660
Just want to talk to her.

210
00:13:30,050 --> 00:13:30,870
Yu Mingxi,

211
00:13:31,730 --> 00:13:32,490
I

212
00:13:32,710 --> 00:13:34,830
have been good friends with Yan Zhengwen for many years.

213
00:13:34,830 --> 00:13:36,630
Today we're just catching up.

214
00:13:36,650 --> 00:13:37,250
Nothing else.

215
00:13:37,250 --> 00:13:38,250
You should go now.

216
00:13:48,350 --> 00:13:48,880
Alright.

217
00:13:53,030 --> 00:13:54,360
Why aren't you leaving?

218
00:13:54,860 --> 00:13:55,530
Really?

219
00:13:55,740 --> 00:13:56,720
Go back quickly.

220
00:13:57,150 --> 00:13:58,400
I'll be going then.

221
00:13:58,420 --> 00:13:59,270
Have fun.

222
00:13:59,550 --> 00:14:00,320
Take care.

223
00:14:12,800 --> 00:14:13,460
Never mind.

224
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:33,120
What's wrong with Jiang Bohan?

225
00:14:33,310 --> 00:14:35,040
He's nice one moment and bad the next.

226
00:14:35,040 --> 00:14:37,370
Why is he hanging out with that thug again?

227
00:15:03,220 --> 00:15:03,840
No,

228
00:15:04,130 --> 00:15:05,460
something's not right.

229
00:16:00,210 --> 00:16:04,100
[Close to You]
