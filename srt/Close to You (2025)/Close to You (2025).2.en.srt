1
00:00:08,480 --> 00:00:09,550
This is the last chance.

2
00:00:09,550 --> 00:00:11,550
Whose name do you want to write down?

3
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:15,080
Still Jiang Bohan.

4
00:00:16,230 --> 00:00:16,780
Are...

5
00:00:16,800 --> 00:00:17,330
You sure?

6
00:00:19,370 --> 00:00:21,430
Originally, they were neck and neck.

7
00:00:21,610 --> 00:00:22,160
However,

8
00:00:22,190 --> 00:00:24,190
I carefully calculated last night.

9
00:00:24,440 --> 00:00:26,370
According to my scoring standard,

10
00:00:26,600 --> 00:00:27,280
Jiang Bohan

11
00:00:27,830 --> 00:00:28,630
scored eight,

12
00:00:28,810 --> 00:00:29,700
and Lin Shaoyang

13
00:00:29,700 --> 00:00:30,500
scored seven.

14
00:00:30,770 --> 00:00:31,450
But

15
00:00:31,480 --> 00:00:32,880
Jiang Bohan is a Scorpio.

16
00:00:33,070 --> 00:00:33,800
I'm a Gemini.

17
00:00:34,320 --> 00:00:34,780
So here,

18
00:00:34,800 --> 00:00:36,070
I deducted one point from him.

19
00:00:36,070 --> 00:00:36,710
Well,

20
00:00:36,730 --> 00:00:38,880
doesn't Lin Shaoyang have any bonus points?

21
00:00:38,880 --> 00:00:39,390
He does.

22
00:00:40,450 --> 00:00:42,180
After adding and subtracting,

23
00:00:42,390 --> 00:00:44,280
he still ends up with seven points in total.

24
00:00:44,280 --> 00:00:44,840
Then,

25
00:00:44,840 --> 00:00:46,700
doesn't he have any other merits?

26
00:00:48,030 --> 00:00:49,320
He seems

27
00:00:49,450 --> 00:00:50,450
to be quite loyal.

28
00:00:50,860 --> 00:00:53,590
He had a relationship that lasted for a few years.

29
00:00:53,750 --> 00:00:55,680
His girlfriend went abroad later,

30
00:00:56,130 --> 00:00:58,150
and they broke up due to the long distance.

31
00:00:58,150 --> 00:00:59,480
What about Jiang Bohan?

32
00:01:00,030 --> 00:01:01,000
Jiang Bohan...

33
00:01:01,480 --> 00:01:02,820
I don't know much about him.

34
00:01:02,820 --> 00:01:03,460
He appears

35
00:01:03,490 --> 00:01:05,450
to have never been in a relationship.

36
00:01:05,450 --> 00:01:06,750
He's been single all along?

37
00:01:06,750 --> 00:01:07,230
That's not good.

38
00:01:07,230 --> 00:01:08,230
You should deduct 10 points from him.

39
00:01:08,230 --> 00:01:08,789
But

40
00:01:08,789 --> 00:01:09,870
in my scoring system,

41
00:01:09,870 --> 00:01:11,670
there's no such deduction item.

42
00:01:11,690 --> 00:01:12,120
No,

43
00:01:12,350 --> 00:01:14,350
I have to remain fair and objective.

44
00:01:14,420 --> 00:01:15,750
It's still Jiang Bohan.

45
00:01:15,930 --> 00:01:16,460
Alright,

46
00:01:16,470 --> 00:01:17,840
as long as you've made your decision.

47
00:01:17,840 --> 00:01:18,870
After their game is over,

48
00:01:18,870 --> 00:01:19,630
we'll go and give it to him.

49
00:01:19,630 --> 00:01:21,960
But what if there are too many people then?

50
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:22,640
Nian,

51
00:01:22,789 --> 00:01:23,280
every time we tried to do so,

52
00:01:23,280 --> 00:01:24,350
you would excuse it by saying that the paper was inappropriate,

53
00:01:24,350 --> 00:01:25,070
the handwriting didn't meet the standard,

54
00:01:25,070 --> 00:01:26,510
or there were too many people.

55
00:01:26,510 --> 00:01:29,370
Your feelings for him should be bravely expressed.

56
00:01:36,410 --> 00:01:37,210
Captain!

57
00:01:37,800 --> 00:01:38,330
Captain!

58
00:01:38,740 --> 00:01:39,470
We won again!

59
00:01:40,759 --> 00:01:41,690
The game is over.

60
00:01:41,870 --> 00:01:42,200
Go.

61
00:01:43,430 --> 00:01:43,890
Well...

62
00:01:44,150 --> 00:01:46,229
What if he doesn't take it?

63
00:01:46,430 --> 00:01:47,150
That won't happen.

64
00:01:47,150 --> 00:01:48,610
Just treat the love letter like a flyer

65
00:01:48,610 --> 00:01:49,960
and pretend he's just a random passerby.

66
00:01:49,960 --> 00:01:51,360
That's all you need to do.

67
00:01:51,950 --> 00:01:53,680
I still don't have the courage.

68
00:01:54,310 --> 00:01:55,120
How about this?

69
00:01:55,120 --> 00:01:56,340
I'll go hand out flyers first.

70
00:01:56,340 --> 00:01:57,170
After I'm done,

71
00:01:57,170 --> 00:01:58,500
you can go give it to him.

72
00:01:59,860 --> 00:02:00,920
I'll be going then.

73
00:02:04,170 --> 00:02:05,030
We finally won!

74
00:02:05,440 --> 00:02:07,500
Where shall we go to celebrate later?

75
00:02:07,720 --> 00:02:10,650
Can you really call a three-point narrow win a victory?

76
00:02:10,650 --> 00:02:11,520
Keep practicing.

77
00:02:11,520 --> 00:02:12,150
Captain,

78
00:02:12,520 --> 00:02:14,710
since we've just finished the game, shouldn't we have a break?

79
00:02:14,710 --> 00:02:15,570
I'm a bit tired.

80
00:02:16,310 --> 00:02:17,540
If you're tired or thirsty,

81
00:02:17,540 --> 00:02:18,850
there's a new promotion at the convenience store.

82
00:02:18,850 --> 00:02:20,850
Buy one, get one free on cold drinks.

83
00:02:27,490 --> 00:02:28,000
No need.

84
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:28,600
Thank you.

85
00:02:30,180 --> 00:02:31,430
How about I help you take one?

86
00:02:31,430 --> 00:02:32,230
I said no need.

87
00:02:34,480 --> 00:02:35,400
You haven't even looked at it yet.

88
00:02:35,400 --> 00:02:37,329
How do you know if you need it or not?

89
00:02:38,590 --> 00:02:39,710
We need to start training.

90
00:02:39,710 --> 00:02:40,360
Why don't you

91
00:02:40,360 --> 00:02:41,120
stay over there for a while?

92
00:02:41,120 --> 00:02:42,980
I'm afraid the ball might hit you.

93
00:02:44,620 --> 00:02:45,420
Wang Chunian!

94
00:02:46,079 --> 00:02:46,680
Come back!

95
00:02:47,720 --> 00:02:48,360
Come back!

96
00:02:48,610 --> 00:02:49,280
I told you so...

97
00:02:49,280 --> 00:02:50,810
Fellow student, watch out!

98
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:54,660
Be careful!

99
00:03:08,910 --> 00:03:10,670
I'll deal with you after I come back.

100
00:03:10,670 --> 00:03:12,030
I really didn't mean to!

101
00:04:12,460 --> 00:04:15,490
[Close to You]

102
00:04:15,520 --> 00:04:18,310
[Episode 2: Does he think I wrote the love letter?]

103
00:04:48,540 --> 00:04:49,680
There's a story behind.

104
00:04:49,680 --> 00:04:50,740
What kind of story?

105
00:04:51,350 --> 00:04:52,310
The way Captain was looking at that girl

106
00:04:52,310 --> 00:04:53,159
is not simple.

107
00:04:53,680 --> 00:04:54,880
Don't talk nonsense.

108
00:05:03,950 --> 00:05:05,480
You actually got it right.

109
00:05:42,730 --> 00:05:43,340
Hi.

110
00:05:43,690 --> 00:05:44,720
May I ask

111
00:05:44,740 --> 00:05:46,140
how long I've passed out?

112
00:05:46,830 --> 00:05:47,890
About an hour or so.

113
00:05:48,580 --> 00:05:49,510
I'm sorry.

114
00:05:49,530 --> 00:05:51,390
I've interrupted your training.

115
00:05:59,690 --> 00:06:00,290
It's okay.

116
00:06:06,050 --> 00:06:07,470
The school doctor said you're not in good health.

117
00:06:07,470 --> 00:06:08,610
Your blood sugar is a bit low.

118
00:06:08,610 --> 00:06:10,670
And you're suffering from insomnia.

119
00:06:11,450 --> 00:06:12,100
Take this.

120
00:06:14,270 --> 00:06:14,870
Thank you.

121
00:06:15,360 --> 00:06:15,800
I'm sorry.

122
00:06:15,800 --> 00:06:16,800
I've caused you trouble.

123
00:06:16,800 --> 00:06:18,290
There's nothing to be sorry about.

124
00:06:18,290 --> 00:06:19,420
It's not your fault.

125
00:06:20,240 --> 00:06:20,700
In a moment,

126
00:06:20,700 --> 00:06:22,430
I'll have He Shuhao come and apologize to you.

127
00:06:22,430 --> 00:06:23,690
He didn't mean to do so.

128
00:06:24,070 --> 00:06:24,560
Also,

129
00:06:25,040 --> 00:06:26,960
the soccer team should come and apologize too.

130
00:06:26,960 --> 00:06:28,230
No, no, that's not necessary.

131
00:06:28,230 --> 00:06:29,040
It's my fault.

132
00:06:29,060 --> 00:06:31,120
I shouldn't have forced the flyer on you.

133
00:06:31,120 --> 00:06:31,950
I fainted

134
00:06:31,950 --> 00:06:33,140
because I didn't have time to eat breakfast this morning.

135
00:06:33,140 --> 00:06:34,280
That's why my blood sugar is a bit low.

136
00:06:34,280 --> 00:06:35,560
I'll be fine in a moment.

137
00:06:35,560 --> 00:06:37,220
Why didn't you eat breakfast?

138
00:06:37,750 --> 00:06:39,210
Did you go play hero again?

139
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:41,130
You still remember?

140
00:06:41,950 --> 00:06:43,550
I'm not a goldfish, you know.

141
00:06:46,300 --> 00:06:47,070
Mingxi.

142
00:06:48,550 --> 00:06:49,310
Are you okay?

143
00:06:57,650 --> 00:06:58,090
Hi,

144
00:06:58,750 --> 00:06:59,600
Jiang Bohan.

145
00:07:00,680 --> 00:07:01,360
Jiang Bohan,

146
00:07:01,360 --> 00:07:02,120
this is

147
00:07:02,120 --> 00:07:03,130
my good friend, Wang Chunian.

148
00:07:03,130 --> 00:07:04,450
She really likes you...

149
00:07:04,450 --> 00:07:05,710
Your basketball team.

150
00:07:07,680 --> 00:07:08,830
If there's nothing else,

151
00:07:08,830 --> 00:07:09,830
I'll be going now.

152
00:07:10,650 --> 00:07:12,850
Love letter, love letter, love letter.

153
00:07:12,850 --> 00:07:13,650
My head aches!

154
00:07:18,680 --> 00:07:19,350
I guess

155
00:07:19,380 --> 00:07:21,710
it's because I was hit by the ball just now.

156
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:23,120
I don't know

157
00:07:23,140 --> 00:07:25,140
when they can find out the sequelae.

158
00:07:25,640 --> 00:07:26,440
How about this?

159
00:07:26,440 --> 00:07:27,750
Nian is my agent.

160
00:07:27,770 --> 00:07:29,660
You two can contact each other if anything comes up.

161
00:07:29,660 --> 00:07:30,420
Agent?

162
00:07:33,240 --> 00:07:33,950
Sequelae?

163
00:07:35,950 --> 00:07:36,600
Anyway,

164
00:07:36,920 --> 00:07:37,680
for the sequelae,

165
00:07:37,680 --> 00:07:39,060
you should take responsibility, right?

166
00:07:39,060 --> 00:07:39,750
Well,

167
00:07:39,890 --> 00:07:42,490
why don't you leave your contact information?

168
00:07:46,430 --> 00:07:46,960
Alright.

169
00:07:48,950 --> 00:07:50,280
I didn't bring my phone.

170
00:07:51,310 --> 00:07:52,840
I didn't bring mine either.

171
00:07:59,360 --> 00:08:00,340
Where should I write it?

172
00:08:00,340 --> 00:08:01,290
Paper, paper, paper.

173
00:08:01,290 --> 00:08:02,490
Paper, paper, paper.

174
00:08:05,600 --> 00:08:07,040
Well done, Wang Chunian.

175
00:08:07,190 --> 00:08:08,700
You've finally worked it out.

176
00:08:08,700 --> 00:08:09,530
Be quick and give it to him.

177
00:08:09,530 --> 00:08:10,990
Be quick and give it to him.

178
00:08:12,830 --> 00:08:13,360
Oh my god.

179
00:08:13,750 --> 00:08:14,630
Love letter?

180
00:08:14,870 --> 00:08:15,360
No.

181
00:08:16,170 --> 00:08:16,760
Why not?

182
00:08:17,630 --> 00:08:18,090
Well...

183
00:08:18,430 --> 00:08:19,090
There are already words

184
00:08:19,090 --> 00:08:19,830
on this paper.

185
00:08:19,830 --> 00:08:21,690
If he wants it, just give it to him.

186
00:08:22,950 --> 00:08:24,880
The doctor said you need more rest.

187
00:08:25,020 --> 00:08:25,680
Don't move.

188
00:08:41,630 --> 00:08:43,000
If there are any sequelae,

189
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:44,400
contact me immediately.

190
00:08:50,520 --> 00:08:51,200
Let me see.

191
00:08:51,790 --> 00:08:52,550
Let me see.

192
00:08:53,310 --> 00:08:53,910
Five yuan.

193
00:08:54,160 --> 00:08:54,600
Deal.

194
00:08:55,490 --> 00:08:56,750
How many is this?

195
00:08:59,840 --> 00:09:00,320
Get up.

196
00:09:05,080 --> 00:09:05,890
Jiang Bohan.

197
00:09:08,960 --> 00:09:10,300
That girl is not ordinary.

198
00:09:10,300 --> 00:09:11,760
I advise you to be careful.

199
00:09:11,830 --> 00:09:12,760
What do you mean?

200
00:09:13,910 --> 00:09:15,120
Can't you see it?

201
00:09:16,200 --> 00:09:16,890
See what?

202
00:09:17,290 --> 00:09:18,690
She doesn't belong here.

203
00:09:18,840 --> 00:09:20,240
She's a student at this school.

204
00:09:20,240 --> 00:09:20,960
If she doesn't belong here,

205
00:09:20,960 --> 00:09:21,720
where does she belong then?

206
00:09:21,720 --> 00:09:22,630
Don't be silly.

207
00:09:23,100 --> 00:09:24,760
I've heard that some parents sold everything they own

208
00:09:24,760 --> 00:09:26,570
just to send their children to this school.

209
00:09:26,570 --> 00:09:27,980
They did this not for anything else,

210
00:09:27,980 --> 00:09:29,090
but to let their children make friends

211
00:09:29,090 --> 00:09:29,670
with those from prestigious families

212
00:09:29,670 --> 00:09:31,130
and with influential backgrounds.

213
00:09:31,130 --> 00:09:33,060
These students work part-time to pay for their studies

214
00:09:33,060 --> 00:09:35,370
while trying every means to get close to you.

215
00:09:35,370 --> 00:09:37,230
I just hope you won't be deceived.

216
00:09:40,600 --> 00:09:41,600
Are you finished?

217
00:09:43,070 --> 00:09:44,440
You're overthinking it.

218
00:09:44,440 --> 00:09:45,360
What kind of person she is

219
00:09:45,360 --> 00:09:46,760
is none of your business.

220
00:09:57,910 --> 00:09:58,910
Look at you.

221
00:09:59,230 --> 00:10:01,690
It was almost directly handed into his hand.

222
00:10:02,030 --> 00:10:02,560
And also,

223
00:10:02,560 --> 00:10:03,760
where did you just go?

224
00:10:04,320 --> 00:10:06,050
Stop criticizing me.

225
00:10:06,270 --> 00:10:08,670
I know I always mess up at critical moments.

226
00:10:09,170 --> 00:10:11,790
I just have the intention but not the courage, you know?

227
00:10:11,790 --> 00:10:12,630
I knew it.

228
00:10:13,440 --> 00:10:13,970
However,

229
00:10:14,190 --> 00:10:16,120
luckily, I got his phone number.

230
00:10:17,380 --> 00:10:18,120
Let me copy it down.

231
00:10:18,120 --> 00:10:18,520
No way.

232
00:10:18,790 --> 00:10:19,950
Let me copy it down.

233
00:10:22,150 --> 00:10:23,740
The flyers I just left here,

234
00:10:23,760 --> 00:10:24,840
where did they go?

235
00:10:25,960 --> 00:10:26,910
It doesn't matter

236
00:10:26,910 --> 00:10:27,870
if you can't find them.

237
00:10:27,870 --> 00:10:28,840
It matters.

238
00:10:29,960 --> 00:10:31,360
Did someone pick them up?

239
00:10:33,240 --> 00:10:34,080
I hope so.

240
00:10:34,390 --> 00:10:36,390
The love letter was also with the flyers.

241
00:10:36,390 --> 00:10:37,990
Are you sure you dropped it here?

242
00:10:37,990 --> 00:10:39,140
When I was demonstrating to you earlier,

243
00:10:39,140 --> 00:10:41,470
I slipped the love letter into the flyers.

244
00:10:41,480 --> 00:10:42,360
What if

245
00:10:42,770 --> 00:10:44,110
the basketball team members picked it up

246
00:10:44,110 --> 00:10:45,370
and Jiang Bohan saw it?

247
00:10:46,260 --> 00:10:46,680
But

248
00:10:46,710 --> 00:10:48,770
isn't it meant for Jiang Bohan to see?

249
00:10:50,180 --> 00:10:52,040
He won't think I wrote it, will he?

250
00:10:52,230 --> 00:10:53,030
Fortunately,

251
00:10:53,230 --> 00:10:54,200
you did write it.

252
00:10:54,480 --> 00:10:56,320
Wang Chunian!

253
00:11:04,760 --> 00:11:05,360
Hey.

254
00:11:07,600 --> 00:11:08,550
Are you looking for

255
00:11:08,550 --> 00:11:10,750
the flyers that just fell on the ground?

256
00:11:12,050 --> 00:11:13,960
They were all picked up by the basketball team members.

257
00:11:13,960 --> 00:11:14,800
I see.

258
00:11:15,160 --> 00:11:16,500
You fainted just now and scared us to death.

259
00:11:16,500 --> 00:11:17,230
Are you okay?

260
00:11:18,170 --> 00:11:19,050
I'm fine.

261
00:11:20,440 --> 00:11:22,960
I heard from Jiang Bohan that your blood sugar is low.

262
00:11:22,960 --> 00:11:24,040
Here's a drink for you

263
00:11:24,040 --> 00:11:25,500
to replenish your energy.

264
00:11:27,240 --> 00:11:28,080
Thank you.

265
00:11:28,950 --> 00:11:29,510
It's nothing.

266
00:11:29,510 --> 00:11:30,240
My pleasure.

267
00:11:31,740 --> 00:11:32,240
By the way,

268
00:11:32,240 --> 00:11:33,080
I'm Qin Siyao.

269
00:11:33,630 --> 00:11:34,630
I'm Yu Mingxi.

270
00:11:34,700 --> 00:11:36,760
This is my good friend, Wang Chunian.

271
00:11:37,250 --> 00:11:38,580
You're new here, right?

272
00:11:39,280 --> 00:11:40,390
If you need any help,

273
00:11:40,390 --> 00:11:41,740
just let us know anytime.

274
00:11:41,740 --> 00:11:43,200
-Sure. Sure.
-Sure. Sure.

275
00:11:51,430 --> 00:11:52,830
She's so nice.

276
00:11:53,870 --> 00:11:55,670
She's the cheerleading captain

277
00:11:56,040 --> 00:11:57,300
and the school beauty.

278
00:11:57,790 --> 00:11:58,630
Everyone in our school

279
00:11:58,630 --> 00:12:00,230
wants to be friends with her.

280
00:12:00,910 --> 00:12:03,040
She actually came over to check on you.

281
00:12:03,190 --> 00:12:04,830
It's a blessing in disguise.

282
00:12:11,990 --> 00:12:12,440
Oh no.

283
00:12:14,040 --> 00:12:15,170
Do you have a backup?

284
00:12:37,400 --> 00:12:39,440
Fairly good at writing.

285
00:12:43,250 --> 00:12:44,510
It's just a bit cheesy.

286
00:13:01,560 --> 00:13:02,630
Lin...

287
00:13:04,870 --> 00:13:05,270
Lin...

288
00:13:05,270 --> 00:13:06,550
Shaoyang?

289
00:13:12,390 --> 00:13:14,630
So half-heartedly, even when writing a love letter.

290
00:13:14,630 --> 00:13:15,820
As if I were blind.

291
00:13:35,510 --> 00:13:35,910
Hello?

292
00:13:36,220 --> 00:13:36,700
Hello.

293
00:13:36,930 --> 00:13:37,910
May I ask

294
00:13:37,910 --> 00:13:39,170
if this is Jiang Bohan?

295
00:13:40,120 --> 00:13:40,970
I'm sorry

296
00:13:40,990 --> 00:13:41,850
to disturb you.

297
00:13:45,840 --> 00:13:46,870
This is the 78th time

298
00:13:46,870 --> 00:13:48,390
for me to make a call.

299
00:13:48,510 --> 00:13:49,820
Why isn't it right yet?

300
00:13:51,340 --> 00:13:53,540
The new love letter hasn't been delivered,

301
00:13:53,540 --> 00:13:55,020
and the old one is lost.

302
00:13:55,410 --> 00:13:57,010
And the phone number is gone.

303
00:13:57,840 --> 00:13:58,930
My love journey

304
00:13:58,960 --> 00:14:00,440
is really bumpy.

305
00:14:01,280 --> 00:14:03,160
The new love letter will be delivered,

306
00:14:03,160 --> 00:14:05,090
and the old one will surely be found.

307
00:14:05,090 --> 00:14:05,720
As for the phone numbers,

308
00:14:05,720 --> 00:14:07,600
there are still...

309
00:14:07,600 --> 00:14:08,200
22 left.

310
00:14:08,430 --> 00:14:10,230
Your love journey hasn't even begun yet.

311
00:14:10,230 --> 00:14:11,560
There are still 22 left?

312
00:14:12,510 --> 00:14:13,910
Why don't we just give up?

313
00:14:14,370 --> 00:14:16,300
The love letter doesn't have my name on it anyway.

314
00:14:16,300 --> 00:14:17,330
Just let it be.

315
00:14:17,360 --> 00:14:17,870
No way.

316
00:14:18,300 --> 00:14:19,180
Didn't I say?

317
00:14:19,210 --> 00:14:20,810
What if they think I wrote it?

318
00:14:43,970 --> 00:14:47,470
♪ The days keep flashing by ♪

319
00:14:44,270 --> 00:14:45,150
Mingxi,

320
00:14:45,470 --> 00:14:46,290
I have something else to attend to.

321
00:14:46,290 --> 00:14:47,090
I'll go first.

322
00:14:47,610 --> 00:14:52,510
♪ It's like being stuck in the wind, not knowing which way to go ♪

323
00:14:48,260 --> 00:14:48,750
Hey,

324
00:14:48,850 --> 00:14:49,810
what is it?

325
00:14:50,690 --> 00:14:52,620
Another mess has been dumped on me?

326
00:14:56,110 --> 00:14:56,840
I'm sorry.

327
00:14:57,160 --> 00:14:58,620
Watch where you're going.

328
00:15:01,090 --> 00:15:01,670
Wen,

329
00:15:02,750 --> 00:15:05,550
isn't that the woman who caused trouble last time?

330
00:15:06,220 --> 00:15:07,350
What a coincidence.

331
00:15:08,240 --> 00:15:09,500
She got away last time.

332
00:15:09,630 --> 00:15:11,230
It won't be so easy this time.

333
00:15:12,070 --> 00:15:13,270
I need to go pick up Yao.

334
00:15:13,270 --> 00:15:14,600
You two go deal with her.

335
00:15:15,040 --> 00:15:15,710
Got it, Wen.

336
00:15:35,870 --> 00:15:36,320
Hello?

337
00:15:36,960 --> 00:15:37,510
Hello.

338
00:15:37,690 --> 00:15:39,420
May I ask if this is Jiang Bohan?

339
00:15:41,350 --> 00:15:42,870
Making personal calls during work hours?

340
00:15:42,870 --> 00:15:44,520
Do you still want to do business or not?

341
00:15:44,520 --> 00:15:45,440
The cigarettes I bought

342
00:15:45,440 --> 00:15:47,240
last time at your store are fake.

343
00:15:47,380 --> 00:15:48,690
Hurry and give me a refund.

344
00:15:48,690 --> 00:15:50,290
How come it's you guys again?

345
00:15:51,140 --> 00:15:52,200
So you remember us.

346
00:15:54,140 --> 00:15:54,900
Yu.

347
00:15:54,930 --> 00:15:55,690
Ming.

348
00:15:55,730 --> 00:15:56,450
Xi.

349
00:15:58,000 --> 00:15:58,880
Got it, got it.

350
00:15:59,410 --> 00:16:01,870
First, resolve this cigarette issue for us.

351
00:16:02,220 --> 00:16:02,910
Sir,

352
00:16:03,030 --> 00:16:04,570
we have never sold this type of cigarettes in our store.

353
00:16:04,570 --> 00:16:06,450
The cigarettes were bought from your store.

354
00:16:06,450 --> 00:16:09,780
Are you suggesting that I'm deliberately causing trouble?

355
00:16:11,260 --> 00:16:12,740
You've already smoked them all.

356
00:16:12,740 --> 00:16:15,570
How would I have known they're fake without smoking them?

357
00:16:15,570 --> 00:16:15,960
Fine.

358
00:16:16,560 --> 00:16:17,320
Then, sir,

359
00:16:17,420 --> 00:16:18,950
please show me the receipt.

360
00:16:18,960 --> 00:16:19,550
Receipt?

361
00:16:20,750 --> 00:16:22,160
Did I not make myself clear?

362
00:16:22,160 --> 00:16:23,510
Hurry and give me a refund,

363
00:16:23,510 --> 00:16:25,180
or I'll make sure your store can't even open for business!

364
00:16:25,180 --> 00:16:26,190
Without a receipt,

365
00:16:26,190 --> 00:16:26,720
how can you prove

366
00:16:26,720 --> 00:16:28,260
that our company sold these cigarettes?

367
00:16:28,260 --> 00:16:29,720
How can I give you a refund?

368
00:16:31,200 --> 00:16:32,800
If you have any other issues,

369
00:16:32,840 --> 00:16:34,670
you can call our store's complaint hotline.

370
00:16:34,670 --> 00:16:35,930
If there's nothing else,

371
00:16:35,930 --> 00:16:36,730
please leave.

372
00:16:36,780 --> 00:16:37,710
I have work to do.

373
00:16:44,680 --> 00:16:46,010
What the hell are these?

374
00:17:06,589 --> 00:17:08,440
Why is it

375
00:17:10,730 --> 00:17:12,130
you useless trash again?

376
00:17:14,290 --> 00:17:15,579
Don't bully the girl.

377
00:17:16,310 --> 00:17:17,440
If you're a real man,

378
00:17:18,160 --> 00:17:19,420
if you have any issues,

379
00:17:20,680 --> 00:17:21,280
come at me.

380
00:17:22,200 --> 00:17:22,640
Fine,

381
00:17:23,200 --> 00:17:24,660
today we're coming at you.

382
00:17:41,070 --> 00:17:41,600
Useless

383
00:17:41,990 --> 00:17:42,510
trash.

384
00:17:42,610 --> 00:17:44,210
You're asking for a beating.

385
00:17:48,750 --> 00:17:49,200
Hey!

386
00:17:49,370 --> 00:17:50,020
Jiang Bohan!

387
00:17:50,020 --> 00:17:50,680
Wait for me!

388
00:18:03,840 --> 00:18:05,320
If you mess with her again,

389
00:18:07,130 --> 00:18:08,790
I won't be so gentle next time.

390
00:18:14,200 --> 00:18:15,960
Who is she to you anyway?

391
00:18:19,680 --> 00:18:20,110
She...

392
00:18:22,650 --> 00:18:23,910
Listen up, both of you.

393
00:18:25,080 --> 00:18:26,280
She's my girlfriend.

394
00:18:28,730 --> 00:18:29,260
Let's go.

395
00:18:29,510 --> 00:18:30,040
Let's go.

396
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:52,800
What are you standing there for?

397
00:18:53,480 --> 00:18:55,830
Are you not going back to the convenience store?

398
00:18:55,830 --> 00:18:56,360
Let's go.

399
00:19:07,400 --> 00:19:11,340
[Close to You]
