00:00:07,080 --> 00:00:08,109
When I was little,

2
00:00:08,670 --> 00:00:10,430
we used to have blackouts all the time.

3
00:00:10,430 --> 00:00:11,630
When I was home alone,

4
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:13,130
I was really scared.

5
00:00:13,980 --> 00:00:14,830
Then one day,

6
00:00:14,870 --> 00:00:16,460
I discovered this sound.

7
00:00:17,800 --> 00:00:18,920
When I closed my eyes,

8
00:00:18,920 --> 00:00:19,710
it was as if

9
00:00:19,730 --> 00:00:20,550
I was living in

10
00:00:20,550 --> 00:00:23,280
a little cabin, with a snowstorm raging outside,

11
00:00:23,800 --> 00:00:24,510
Inside,

12
00:00:24,800 --> 00:00:25,760
by the fire,

13
00:00:26,480 --> 00:00:28,010
I wasn't so scared anymore.

14
00:00:29,600 --> 00:00:30,920
It was like

15
00:00:31,440 --> 00:00:33,100
no matter how big the world is,

16
00:00:33,560 --> 00:00:34,820
there's always a place

17
00:00:34,920 --> 00:00:36,250
where I can feel warmth.

18
00:00:42,280 --> 00:00:42,880
Thank you

19
00:00:46,030 --> 00:00:47,290
for making my birthday

20
00:00:48,640 --> 00:00:49,960
quite meaningful.

21
00:00:52,110 --> 00:00:53,440
Today is your birthday?

22
00:00:56,320 --> 00:00:57,240
There's still

23
00:00:58,560 --> 00:00:59,840
20 minutes left.

24
00:01:00,430 --> 00:01:02,160

25
00:01:02,640 --> 00:01:04,640

26
00:01:04,640 --> 00:01:06,700
There's nothing much to say about it.

27
00:01:06,840 --> 00:01:07,310

just disappear?

189
00:11:02,390 --> 00:11:03,550
so it doesn’t stick to your lips —

190
00:11:03,550 --> 00:11:04,140
it’s more elegant

191
00:11:04,140 --> 00:11:04,710
to drink.

192
00:11:04,930 --> 00:11:06,480
That’s why it suits you.

193
00:11:09,030 --> 00:11:11,290
I remember you didn't use to like coffee.

194
00:11:11,580 --> 00:11:12,950
Well, you liked it,

195
00:11:13,080 --> 00:11:14,270
so I looked into it.

196
00:11:15,230 --> 00:11:17,830
Then why keep drinking it if you didn’t like it?

197
00:11:23,620 --> 00:11:25,020
I didn't like it at first,

198
00:11:25,550 --> 00:11:27,010
because it tastes bitter.

199
00:11:27,150 --> 00:11:28,410
But the more I drank it,

200
00:11:29,030 --> 00:11:30,630
the more I started to like it.

201
00:11:35,360 --> 00:11:36,000
So you see,

202
00:11:36,810 --> 00:11:38,480
forming a new habit...

203
00:11:38,500 --> 00:11:40,230
It only takes twenty-one days.

204
00:11:46,910 --> 00:11:49,310
You haven’t seen your therapist in a while.

205
00:11:49,390 --> 00:11:50,650
Are you doing okay now?

206
00:11:52,670 --> 00:11:55,070
Did you two keep in touch after the breakup?

207
00:11:56,670 --> 00:11:57,800
It’s been two years.

208
00:11:58,810 --> 00:12:00,210
We haven’t spoken since.

209
00:12:00,750 --> 00:12:01,390
Now,

210
00:12:02,630 --> 00:12:04,630
I don't want to contact her anymore.

211
00:12:06,810 --> 00:12:08,810
Actually, I kind of want to meet her.

212
00:12:10,720 --> 00:12:11,120
Why?

213
00:12:11,870 --> 00:12:12,600
To thank her.

214
00:12:13,060 --> 00:12:14,790
If it weren’t for her, I wouldn’t have met you.

215
00:12:14,790 --> 00:12:16,320
Finding joy in sorrow, huh?

216
00:12:17,200 --> 00:12:17,670
This is

217
00:12:17,670 --> 00:12:18,320
called

218
00:12:19,200 --> 00:12:21,280
looking for the silver lining.

219
00:12:26,370 --> 00:12:29,130
I thought you went abroad to live your happily-ever-after

220
00:12:29,130 --> 00:12:30,390
and forgot all about us.

221
00:12:30,390 --> 00:12:31,510
I just went abroad.

222
00:12:31,510 --> 00:12:33,170
It's not like I have dementia.

223
00:12:34,840 --> 00:12:35,840
I really envy you.

224
00:12:36,320 --> 00:12:40,440
You're so young, and you've already found someone worth loving for a lifetime.

225
00:12:40,440 --> 00:12:41,700
A lifetime is too long.

226
00:12:42,550 --> 00:12:44,550
Living well in the moment is enough.

227
00:12:45,840 --> 00:12:47,080
My birthday is coming up.

228
00:12:47,080 --> 00:12:48,510
What are you getting me?

229
00:12:51,270 --> 00:12:52,120
How about me?

230
00:12:53,510 --> 00:12:55,970
You little rascal, how dare you joke with me?

231
00:12:57,480 --> 00:12:58,520
If you don't like it,

232
00:12:58,520 --> 00:13:00,380
I won't give myself as a gift then.

233
00:13:06,320 --> 00:13:06,870
Mingxi,

234
00:13:07,390 --> 00:13:09,150
take Jingchu to stay somewhere else for a couple of days.

235
00:13:09,150 --> 00:13:09,840
Go now.

236
00:13:10,200 --> 00:13:10,750
Why?

237
00:13:10,870 --> 00:13:11,910
Why so sudden?

238
00:13:12,440 --> 00:13:14,670
Those debt collectors are getting bolder.

239
00:13:14,670 --> 00:13:15,930
I'm worried about you.

240
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:17,800
I'm afraid they'll come and cause trouble for you.

241
00:13:17,800 --> 00:13:18,290
Mom,

242
00:13:18,320 --> 00:13:19,030
don't worry.

243
00:13:19,030 --> 00:13:20,080
We live in a society governed by law now.

244
00:13:20,080 --> 00:13:21,680
They won't do anything to me.

245
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:22,360
No.

246
00:13:22,840 --> 00:13:23,570
Listen to me.

247
00:13:23,720 --> 00:13:24,390
Leave now.

248
00:13:24,870 --> 00:13:26,070
Don't worry about us.

249
00:13:26,120 --> 00:13:27,600
Remember to come back early.

250
00:13:27,600 --> 00:13:28,000
Okay.

251
00:13:29,230 --> 00:13:29,710
Mom,

252
00:13:29,730 --> 00:13:30,660
I’ll hang up now.

253
00:13:31,200 --> 00:13:31,790
Stop right there!

254
00:13:31,790 --> 00:13:32,920
Why are you running?

255
00:13:33,450 --> 00:13:34,010
Stop!

256
00:13:39,720 --> 00:13:40,390
Yu Mingxi.

257
00:13:40,570 --> 00:13:41,120
Who are you?

258
00:13:41,120 --> 00:13:41,620
Get in the car.

259
00:13:41,620 --> 00:13:42,220
Don't run!

260
00:13:42,390 --> 00:13:42,870
Stop!

261
00:13:58,000 --> 00:13:58,910
She got away.

262
00:14:06,230 --> 00:14:08,630
So you're Jiang Bohan's senior.

263
00:14:08,870 --> 00:14:09,440
Yes, I am.

264
00:14:09,460 --> 00:14:11,200
I also graduated from Jingcai College.

265
00:14:11,200 --> 00:14:13,030
Who were those people just now?

266
00:14:13,870 --> 00:14:14,720
They're

267
00:14:15,150 --> 00:14:16,150
debt collectors.

268
00:14:18,360 --> 00:14:19,120
But,

269
00:14:19,390 --> 00:14:20,200
Senior,

270
00:14:20,280 --> 00:14:21,810
why were you at my doorstep?

271
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:25,000
I came here specifically to see you.

272
00:14:26,870 --> 00:14:29,520
I want to ask for your help in persuading Jiang Bohan

273
00:14:29,520 --> 00:14:32,320
to accept the Blue Wolves' offer to play overseas.

274
00:14:33,770 --> 00:14:34,720
Blue Wolves?

275
00:14:37,480 --> 00:14:40,750
Jiang Bohan has been playing basketball since elementary school.

276
00:14:40,750 --> 00:14:43,350
He was rated a four-star player in high school,

277
00:14:43,510 --> 00:14:47,110
and after graduation, he got an invitation from the Blue Wolves.

278
00:14:47,840 --> 00:14:50,370
Back then, he had a bright future ahead of him.

279
00:14:54,910 --> 00:14:57,240
He must have told you about Boyang, right?

280
00:14:58,790 --> 00:14:59,240
Since then,

281
00:14:59,240 --> 00:15:01,170
he's been like a different person.

282
00:15:01,200 --> 00:15:03,400
He never mentioned going abroad again,

283
00:15:03,750 --> 00:15:05,480
and even turned down the offer.

284
00:15:05,670 --> 00:15:08,330
Thankfully, his mom managed to stop him in time.

285
00:15:09,150 --> 00:15:10,550
It's been over two years.

286
00:15:11,200 --> 00:15:12,660
It's time to move forward.

287
00:15:16,120 --> 00:15:17,790
Actually, ever since he met you,

288
00:15:17,790 --> 00:15:19,320
he’s become a lot more open.

289
00:15:20,490 --> 00:15:22,490
I know you're very important to him.

290
00:15:23,270 --> 00:15:24,800
If you truly care about him,

291
00:15:25,190 --> 00:15:26,790
please help me persuade him.

292
00:15:29,720 --> 00:15:30,440
But...

293
00:15:30,750 --> 00:15:31,220
Would he

294
00:15:31,240 --> 00:15:32,710
even listen to me?

295
00:15:34,710 --> 00:15:36,140
I've never seen

296
00:15:36,440 --> 00:15:38,640
him care this much about any other girl.

297
00:15:40,510 --> 00:15:42,150
After Boyang left,

298
00:15:42,960 --> 00:15:45,760
he stopped celebrating his birthday altogether.

299
00:15:46,200 --> 00:15:48,800
But he was willing to blow out candles with you.

300
00:15:49,670 --> 00:15:52,600
That means you’ve already found a place in his heart.

301
00:15:58,630 --> 00:16:00,050
Go abroad with him.

302
00:16:01,080 --> 00:16:01,850
But...

303
00:16:01,880 --> 00:16:02,480
Senior,

304
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:04,060
you know about

305
00:16:04,320 --> 00:16:05,650
my family's situation.

306
00:16:06,440 --> 00:16:07,870
So you're working so hard

307
00:16:08,910 --> 00:16:10,110
just to pay off debts?

308
00:16:11,950 --> 00:16:12,430
Senior,

309
00:16:12,680 --> 00:16:14,280
please promise me you’ll keep this a secret.

310
00:16:14,280 --> 00:16:16,030
You absolutely can’t tell Jiang Bohan.

311
00:16:16,030 --> 00:16:16,760
Don't worry,

312
00:16:16,840 --> 00:16:18,040
I won't say anything.

313
00:16:18,440 --> 00:16:20,440
Actually, if you have financial difficulties,

314
00:16:20,440 --> 00:16:22,500
I can also try to find a way to help you.

315
00:16:23,080 --> 00:16:23,550
No need.

316
00:16:23,960 --> 00:16:24,840
This is my

317
00:16:25,110 --> 00:16:26,150
family’s problem.

318
00:16:26,150 --> 00:16:26,950
I still want to

319
00:16:27,150 --> 00:16:28,150
handle it myself.

320
00:16:28,150 --> 00:16:29,750
You don't have to be so polite with me.

321
00:16:29,750 --> 00:16:31,310
It's not like I'm asking you not to pay me back.

322
00:16:31,310 --> 00:16:33,710
I'm just waiving the interest, that's all.

323
00:16:33,910 --> 00:16:35,750
You're so young, yet already

324
00:16:35,750 --> 00:16:36,750
burdened by life.

325
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:38,060
Even I feel for you.

326
00:16:38,150 --> 00:16:39,430
Let alone Jiang Bohan.

327
00:16:42,960 --> 00:16:43,610
Or,

328
00:16:43,850 --> 00:16:45,520
if you need someone to talk to,

329
00:16:45,600 --> 00:16:46,600
you can come to me.

330
00:16:46,750 --> 00:16:47,480
Trust me,

331
00:16:47,670 --> 00:16:49,930
I'm a professional emotional dumpster.

332
00:17:09,630 --> 00:17:11,849
You’ve already found your way into his heart.

333
00:17:11,849 --> 00:17:13,130
Go abroad with him.

334
00:17:14,270 --> 00:17:15,030
Do me a favor.

335
00:17:15,790 --> 00:17:17,510
Please don't break his heart.

336
00:17:41,580 --> 00:17:45,390
[Close to You]
