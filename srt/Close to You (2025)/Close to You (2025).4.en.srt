00:00:06,590 --> 00:00:07,870
Congratulations to the Jingcai basketball team

[Jingcai College]

3
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:09,480
on winning last week's

4
00:00:09,580 --> 00:00:10,580
basketball game!

5
00:00:10,670 --> 00:00:11,080
Next,

6
00:00:11,080 --> 00:00:12,000
let's take a look back at

7
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:12,560
the basketball team's

8
00:00:12,560 --> 00:00:15,240
excellent performance in this match.

9
00:00:15,260 --> 00:00:15,920
Applause!

10
00:00:31,960 --> 00:00:32,890
What's going on?

11
00:00:33,600 --> 00:00:34,730
Is that Jiang Bohan?

12
00:00:36,030 --> 00:00:36,760
Who did this?

13
00:00:37,640 --> 00:00:38,670
Come over here, quickly!

14
00:00:38,670 --> 00:00:39,430
Here he comes!

15
00:00:39,430 --> 00:00:40,560
Jiang Bohan is here!

16
00:00:40,640 --> 00:00:41,770
Jiang Bohan is here!

17
00:00:43,450 --> 00:00:44,130
Turn it off!

18
00:00:45,020 --> 00:00:45,880
Turn it off now!

19
00:00:46,880 --> 00:00:47,960
Where are you going?

20
00:00:47,960 --> 00:00:48,810
What?

21
00:00:50,010 --> 00:00:50,740
Come with me.

22
00:01:02,540 --> 00:01:03,540
Why is it her?

23
00:01:03,720 --> 00:01:05,489
Like a toad dreaming of dating a swan.

24
00:01:05,489 --> 00:01:06,610
She should look in the mirror.

25
00:01:06,610 --> 00:01:09,010
Why does she think she can like Jiang Bohan?

26
00:01:13,880 --> 00:01:14,770
First of all,

27
00:01:14,789 --> 00:01:15,490
I don't know who

28
00:01:15,490 --> 00:01:16,330
was so bored

29
00:01:16,670 --> 00:01:17,400
to make a poster

30
00:01:17,400 --> 00:01:18,800
and paste it everywhere.

31
00:01:18,920 --> 00:01:20,220
But to be fair, the poster looks good.

32
00:01:20,220 --> 00:01:22,280
Remember to smooth my skin next time.

33
00:01:22,780 --> 00:01:23,780
Secondly,

34
00:01:23,960 --> 00:01:25,789
I hope everyone will gossip less

35
00:01:25,820 --> 00:01:26,900
and study more.

36
00:01:27,030 --> 00:01:28,850
Otherwise, you'll be looked down upon like me,

37
00:01:28,850 --> 00:01:30,550
and become the target of rumors.

38
00:01:30,550 --> 00:01:31,350
Lastly,

39
00:01:31,890 --> 00:01:34,690
I despise people who scheme behind others' backs.

40
00:01:35,789 --> 00:01:37,729
You all want to know who wrote the love letter, right?

41
00:01:37,729 --> 00:01:38,420
That's right,

42
00:01:38,420 --> 00:01:38,970
it was...

43
00:01:39,680 --> 00:01:40,740
What are you doing?

44
00:01:44,160 --> 00:01:45,080
First of all,

45
00:01:45,590 --> 00:01:48,160
today is indeed a pretty good day.

46
00:01:48,640 --> 00:01:50,080
Yu Mingxi is right,

47
00:01:51,120 --> 00:01:52,430
the poster looks good.

48
00:01:52,680 --> 00:01:53,880
Keep up the good work.

49
00:01:56,680 --> 00:01:57,560
To be honest,

50
00:01:57,920 --> 00:02:00,070
I've always hated strawberry flavor.

51
00:02:00,800 --> 00:02:01,600
But,

52
00:02:01,620 --> 00:02:02,900
starting from today,

53
00:02:17,990 --> 00:02:18,760
I like it.

54
00:02:30,640 --> 00:02:31,370
Give her a kiss!

55
00:02:31,370 --> 00:02:32,090
Kiss...

56
00:02:37,530 --> 00:02:39,000
Was I out of my mind?

57
00:02:40,340 --> 00:02:40,990
Not at all.

58
00:02:41,360 --> 00:02:42,960
I think you were pretty cool.

59
00:02:43,020 --> 00:02:43,840
What am I going to do

60
00:02:43,840 --> 00:02:45,040
at school from now on?

61
00:02:46,079 --> 00:02:46,810
Don't worry.

62
00:02:46,950 --> 00:02:47,740
If the sky falls...

63
00:02:47,740 --> 00:02:49,140
You'll hold it up, right?

64
00:03:53,800 --> 00:03:56,790
[Close to You]

65
00:03:56,810 --> 00:03:59,150
[Episode 4: If the Sky Falls, I'll Hold It Up for You]

66
00:03:59,329 --> 00:04:00,780
[Headmaster's Office]

67
00:04:03,200 --> 00:04:04,190
You'll hold it up.

68
00:04:04,190 --> 00:04:05,590
Can you really hold it up?

69
00:04:08,080 --> 00:04:09,520
If not me, then who? You?

70
00:04:10,580 --> 00:04:11,660
Easy for you to say.

71
00:04:12,500 --> 00:04:13,290
Come in.

72
00:04:26,550 --> 00:04:27,950
You're Yu Mingxi, right?

73
00:04:28,710 --> 00:04:31,080
Your grades were quite good at your previous school.

74
00:04:31,080 --> 00:04:33,990
How come you're now at the bottom, even in basic bilingual classes?

75
00:04:33,990 --> 00:04:35,720
Especially Academic English.

76
00:04:35,860 --> 00:04:38,550
You haven't met the language requirements for the international 2+2 program.

77
00:04:38,550 --> 00:04:41,380
Even if you score A in all your major courses, it won't matter.

78
00:04:41,380 --> 00:04:42,520
I'm sorry, Headmaster.

79
00:04:42,520 --> 00:04:44,180
I will work hard on my English.

80
00:04:46,190 --> 00:04:47,159
Or is it that

81
00:04:47,159 --> 00:04:48,190
your mind

82
00:04:48,190 --> 00:04:50,050
hasn't been on your studies at all

83
00:04:50,070 --> 00:04:51,600
and that you've been too busy writing love letters,

84
00:04:51,600 --> 00:04:52,680
confessing your feelings?

85
00:04:52,680 --> 00:04:53,280
Is that it?

86
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:54,730
That's not true, Headmaster.

87
00:04:54,730 --> 00:04:56,470
That was truly a misunderstanding.

88
00:04:56,470 --> 00:04:58,530
We at Jingcai College made an exception

89
00:04:58,530 --> 00:05:00,000
to reduce your tuition fees

90
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:01,310
out of respect for your father

91
00:05:01,310 --> 00:05:03,170
and allowed you to transfer here.

92
00:05:04,120 --> 00:05:06,920
It's one thing if you don't put in effort yourself,

93
00:05:06,980 --> 00:05:08,840
but don't affect other students.

94
00:05:10,550 --> 00:05:11,870
I'm sorry, Headmaster.

95
00:05:11,870 --> 00:05:14,130
I will definitely study hard from now on.

96
00:05:14,130 --> 00:05:14,890
This time,

97
00:05:15,160 --> 00:05:16,070
can we not let it affect

98
00:05:16,070 --> 00:05:17,750
my scholarship application?

99
00:05:19,270 --> 00:05:20,270
For your situation,

100
00:05:20,270 --> 00:05:23,190
although you meet the application criteria for the scholarship,

101
00:05:23,190 --> 00:05:23,920
it's awarded to students

102
00:05:23,920 --> 00:05:26,320
who excel in both character and academics.

103
00:05:26,480 --> 00:05:27,940
With your current grades,

104
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:29,830
whether you can even stay on is already in question,

105
00:05:29,830 --> 00:05:31,430
let alone a scholarship.

106
00:05:34,280 --> 00:05:36,110
For the upcoming GPA rankings,

107
00:05:36,190 --> 00:05:37,720
if there's no improvement,

108
00:05:37,790 --> 00:05:39,720
please return to your old college.

109
00:05:41,690 --> 00:05:42,690
Yes, Headmaster.

110
00:05:43,720 --> 00:05:45,680
This time, we'll consider it misconduct.

111
00:05:45,680 --> 00:05:46,710
Just write a reflection.

112
00:05:46,710 --> 00:05:48,640
We won’t pursue anything further.

113
00:05:49,430 --> 00:05:49,970
Thank you, Headmaster.

114
00:05:49,970 --> 00:05:50,970
Are you finished?

115
00:05:52,020 --> 00:05:52,909
What are you doing?

116
00:05:52,909 --> 00:05:54,600
You don't need to beat around the bush.

117
00:05:54,600 --> 00:05:55,870
The student you mentioned

118
00:05:55,870 --> 00:05:56,920
who was affected by her,

119
00:05:56,920 --> 00:05:58,000
was me, right?

120
00:05:58,950 --> 00:06:01,170
May I ask which of my grades she has affected?

121
00:06:01,170 --> 00:06:01,800
If one day

122
00:06:01,830 --> 00:06:03,540
I fall to second place in the school,

123
00:06:03,540 --> 00:06:05,700
then you can come and condemn me.

124
00:06:07,100 --> 00:06:07,890
Yu Mingxi

125
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:10,200
wrote a love letter

126
00:06:10,820 --> 00:06:12,150
and that's misconduct?

127
00:06:13,300 --> 00:06:14,960
Our school's moral standards

128
00:06:15,050 --> 00:06:16,780
are too outdated, aren't they?

129
00:06:17,130 --> 00:06:18,010
Jiang Bohan,

130
00:06:18,640 --> 00:06:20,900
you're getting more and more out of line.

131
00:06:22,060 --> 00:06:22,670
Can't help it,

132
00:06:22,670 --> 00:06:23,670
I was raised well.

133
00:06:24,720 --> 00:06:25,430
Well,

134
00:06:25,780 --> 00:06:27,140
why don't you invite my father here

135
00:06:27,140 --> 00:06:28,460
to lecture me as well?

136
00:06:28,980 --> 00:06:29,980
What do you think?

137
00:06:32,159 --> 00:06:32,600
Mom.

138
00:06:35,590 --> 00:06:35,980
Mom?

139
00:06:39,240 --> 00:06:39,920
Get out.

140
00:06:40,110 --> 00:06:41,240
Both of you, get out!

141
00:06:43,200 --> 00:06:43,680
Wait.

142
00:06:45,040 --> 00:06:46,500
Stay behind after school.

143
00:06:46,530 --> 00:06:47,870
Remove every love letter

144
00:06:47,870 --> 00:06:49,390
stuck on the wall before you leave.

145
00:06:49,390 --> 00:06:50,180
Why don't you punish

146
00:06:50,180 --> 00:06:51,850
the person who put the love letters up?

147
00:06:51,850 --> 00:06:54,409
You two were directly involved in the incident.

148
00:06:54,409 --> 00:06:55,370
Is it wrong to punish you?

149
00:06:55,370 --> 00:06:56,380
What incident exactly?

150
00:06:56,380 --> 00:06:58,050
Writing love letters or defacing property?

151
00:06:58,050 --> 00:06:58,800
Neither.

152
00:06:59,950 --> 00:07:00,680
Jiang Bohan,

153
00:07:01,240 --> 00:07:04,120
now is not the time for you to be in a relationship.

154
00:07:06,560 --> 00:07:07,000
Fine.

155
00:07:07,920 --> 00:07:08,870
Well, since

156
00:07:09,660 --> 00:07:12,060
you've already defined our relationship,

157
00:07:12,890 --> 00:07:13,570
I'll

158
00:07:13,640 --> 00:07:14,810
respectfully obey.

159
00:07:15,720 --> 00:07:16,450
I'm leaving.

160
00:07:23,620 --> 00:07:24,350
Headmaster,

161
00:07:25,630 --> 00:07:26,270
I...

162
00:07:28,070 --> 00:07:28,750
Yu Mingxi,

163
00:07:29,720 --> 00:07:31,520
I'm telling you very seriously,

164
00:07:31,630 --> 00:07:33,390
if you don't want to be expelled,

165
00:07:33,390 --> 00:07:34,630
you must strictly follow

166
00:07:34,630 --> 00:07:36,560
Jingcai College's rules and regulations.

167
00:07:36,560 --> 00:07:37,620
Do you understand?

168
00:07:37,920 --> 00:07:38,980
Yes, I understand.

169
00:07:40,050 --> 00:07:41,710
Given your family situation,

170
00:07:42,330 --> 00:07:43,640
regarding the scholarship,

171
00:07:43,640 --> 00:07:45,190
I will give it extra consideration.

172
00:07:45,190 --> 00:07:45,990
You can go now.

173
00:07:48,159 --> 00:07:49,490
Thank you, Headmaster.

174
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:54,530
Let's go.

175
00:08:03,160 --> 00:08:03,720
Manager,

176
00:08:04,160 --> 00:08:04,800
I'm sorry,

177
00:08:04,800 --> 00:08:07,060
I need someone to cover my shift tonight.

178
00:08:08,120 --> 00:08:08,600
Yes.

179
00:08:08,730 --> 00:08:09,270
It's the

180
00:08:09,270 --> 00:08:10,870
super cute girl

181
00:08:10,870 --> 00:08:12,070
called Wang Chunian.

182
00:08:12,720 --> 00:08:13,120
Okay.

183
00:08:13,320 --> 00:08:14,450
Thank you, Manager.

184
00:08:21,490 --> 00:08:23,720
Jiang Bohan, why are you still sitting around?

185
00:08:23,720 --> 00:08:26,380
If you don’t start cleaning, it’ll be dark soon.

186
00:08:27,240 --> 00:08:27,920
Yu Mingxi.

187
00:08:29,480 --> 00:08:31,680
Do you know how much tuition is per year?

188
00:08:31,830 --> 00:08:32,760
Of course I know.

189
00:08:33,720 --> 00:08:35,080
We didn't pay all that money

190
00:08:35,080 --> 00:08:36,720
to come and clean.

191
00:08:37,200 --> 00:08:38,659
You think I want to do this?

192
00:08:40,360 --> 00:08:41,360
So, how exactly did you

193
00:08:41,360 --> 00:08:43,000
get exceptional admission?

194
00:08:43,909 --> 00:08:45,440
Because of my father.

195
00:08:49,750 --> 00:08:50,360
It's all your fault that

196
00:08:50,360 --> 00:08:51,530
I'm getting punished.

197
00:08:51,530 --> 00:08:52,260
So annoying.

198
00:08:57,870 --> 00:08:58,670
Because of me?

199
00:08:59,200 --> 00:08:59,750
Yeah.

200
00:09:05,670 --> 00:09:06,000
Fine.

201
00:09:07,630 --> 00:09:08,360
Give it to me.

202
00:09:09,370 --> 00:09:10,360
If you don't want to do it, forget it.

203
00:09:10,360 --> 00:09:11,360
I won't force you.

204
00:09:11,480 --> 00:09:12,210
Give it to me.

205
00:09:13,240 --> 00:09:13,910
Never mind.

206
00:09:13,910 --> 00:09:14,510
Give it to me.

207
00:09:14,510 --> 00:09:15,080
Never mind.

208
00:09:15,080 --> 00:09:15,870
Give it to me!

209
00:09:24,130 --> 00:09:25,630
I'm covered in dirty water.

210
00:09:25,630 --> 00:09:26,390
How fitting.

211
00:09:52,270 --> 00:09:54,670
Why are you wearing the old school uniform?

212
00:09:54,870 --> 00:09:55,850
You think I want to?

213
00:09:55,850 --> 00:09:57,710
The new uniform costs 1,880 yuan.

214
00:10:02,570 --> 00:10:04,030
It doesn't matter anyway.

215
00:10:04,470 --> 00:10:06,530
The headmaster gave me an ultimatum,

216
00:10:06,850 --> 00:10:07,750
to improve

217
00:10:07,750 --> 00:10:08,870
my grades quickly,

218
00:10:09,950 --> 00:10:11,340
or drop out.

219
00:10:12,710 --> 00:10:14,910
Improving your grades isn’t that hard.

220
00:10:15,290 --> 00:10:16,490
It's not that simple.

221
00:10:16,690 --> 00:10:17,550
I'll teach you.

222
00:10:18,750 --> 00:10:19,440
Forget it.

223
00:10:19,910 --> 00:10:21,040
The headmaster said

224
00:10:21,250 --> 00:10:23,310
you have more important things to do.

225
00:10:23,910 --> 00:10:24,910
Besides,

226
00:10:24,930 --> 00:10:27,150
even though there’s nothing going on between us,

227
00:10:27,150 --> 00:10:27,980
but

228
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:29,660
to put the headmaster at ease,

229
00:10:29,670 --> 00:10:31,200
I should stay away from you.

230
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:33,790
What good does

231
00:10:33,790 --> 00:10:35,520
staying away from me do for you?

232
00:10:36,720 --> 00:10:38,120
It doesn't do me any good.

233
00:10:38,440 --> 00:10:39,570
But before I met you,

234
00:10:39,630 --> 00:10:40,840
I was never insulted,

235
00:10:40,910 --> 00:10:42,170
never gossiped about,

236
00:10:42,270 --> 00:10:42,790
and I didn't have to deal with

237
00:10:42,790 --> 00:10:44,390
all these messy situations.

238
00:10:54,600 --> 00:10:56,000
I didn't mean it that way.

239
00:10:56,510 --> 00:10:57,320
It's because

240
00:10:57,920 --> 00:10:59,730
the headmaster has high hopes for you.

241
00:10:59,730 --> 00:11:01,530
You're her only source of pride.

242
00:11:02,200 --> 00:11:03,150
So,

243
00:11:03,670 --> 00:11:05,670
let's keep our distance from now on.

244
00:11:07,910 --> 00:11:08,360
Fine.

245
00:11:12,080 --> 00:11:13,740
Let's keep our distance then.

246
00:11:18,110 --> 00:11:18,970
You can go back.

247
00:11:18,980 --> 00:11:20,640
You don't need to clean today.

248
00:11:21,480 --> 00:11:21,910
But

249
00:11:21,930 --> 00:11:22,850
if I don't finish cleaning today,

250
00:11:22,850 --> 00:11:24,110
I'll be dead tomorrow.

251
00:11:30,200 --> 00:11:30,800
You won't.

252
00:11:31,510 --> 00:11:32,840
Remember what you said.

253
00:11:35,190 --> 00:11:36,320
Keep your distance.

254
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:41,690
Your clothes.

255
00:11:41,690 --> 00:11:42,420
Go!

256
00:12:18,950 --> 00:12:20,190
Starting today,

257
00:12:21,550 --> 00:12:23,810
you'd better keep your distance from me.

258
00:12:24,390 --> 00:12:25,590
Are you done talking?

259
00:12:25,690 --> 00:12:26,790
You're overthinking it.

260
00:12:26,790 --> 00:12:27,670
What kind of person she is

261
00:12:27,670 --> 00:12:29,070
is none of your business.

262
00:12:29,240 --> 00:12:31,390
I really hate strawberry flavor.

263
00:12:31,910 --> 00:12:32,790
But,

264
00:12:32,810 --> 00:12:33,880
from today on,

265
00:12:34,270 --> 00:12:36,000
I like it.

266
00:12:42,150 --> 00:12:44,080
Why can't you hold your composure?

267
00:12:46,060 --> 00:12:46,630
Mom,

268
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:48,330
what are you doing here?

269
00:12:50,750 --> 00:12:53,080
I just attended the school board meeting.

270
00:12:54,240 --> 00:12:55,870
I saw the concert program.

271
00:12:56,300 --> 00:12:57,810
Why aren't you the finale?

272
00:13:02,840 --> 00:13:05,170
Did you make a mistake during rehearsals?

273
00:13:13,030 --> 00:13:15,630
When did you become so mediocre?

274
00:13:20,550 --> 00:13:22,000
At the next concert,

275
00:13:22,790 --> 00:13:24,750
my daughter must be the finale.

276
00:13:25,840 --> 00:13:27,270
I don't want to turn up

277
00:13:27,270 --> 00:13:29,000
and be mocked by other mothers.

278
00:13:35,910 --> 00:13:37,710
Whether you improve your skills

279
00:13:38,630 --> 00:13:40,080
or pull some strings,

280
00:13:43,510 --> 00:13:44,840
use any means necessary

281
00:13:45,360 --> 00:13:46,790
to achieve your goal.

282
00:13:49,600 --> 00:13:50,400
I understand,

283
00:13:50,670 --> 00:13:51,000
Mom.

284
00:13:57,430 --> 00:13:59,360
Don't expose your emotions easily

285
00:13:59,790 --> 00:14:01,850
and let others know your weaknesses.

286
00:14:05,870 --> 00:14:06,390
Got it,

287
00:14:07,910 --> 00:14:08,270
Mom.

288
00:14:27,120 --> 00:14:27,850
Jiang Bohan.

289
00:14:31,200 --> 00:14:32,510
I don’t have time to mess around with you today.

290
00:14:32,510 --> 00:14:33,240
Jiang Bohan.

291
00:14:38,030 --> 00:14:40,160
It's been so long since that incident.

292
00:14:40,240 --> 00:14:42,300
Why do you still refuse to forgive me?

293
00:14:45,750 --> 00:14:47,950
It has nothing to do with that incident.

294
00:14:49,030 --> 00:14:49,630
Moreover,

295
00:14:51,270 --> 00:14:52,530
you've crossed a line.

296
00:14:54,270 --> 00:14:55,200
I crossed a line?

297
00:14:56,510 --> 00:14:58,240
So you’re treating me like this

298
00:14:58,900 --> 00:15:00,560
all because of that Yu Mingxi?

299
00:15:04,150 --> 00:15:06,010
You asked me to stay away from you.

300
00:15:06,110 --> 00:15:06,750
I agreed.

301
00:15:08,270 --> 00:15:09,840
I joined the cheerleading squad to watch you from afar

302
00:15:09,840 --> 00:15:10,770
and cheer you on.

303
00:15:11,590 --> 00:15:12,650
But what about you?

304
00:15:13,600 --> 00:15:14,440
I didn't give you space

305
00:15:14,440 --> 00:15:14,840
so you could

306
00:15:14,840 --> 00:15:16,360
date someone else.

307
00:15:20,610 --> 00:15:21,660
Give me space?

308
00:15:24,080 --> 00:15:25,240
Where do you get the confidence

309
00:15:25,240 --> 00:15:26,390
to say such things?

310
00:15:27,320 --> 00:15:28,080
Confidence?

311
00:15:28,600 --> 00:15:29,600
We've been childhood sweethearts

312
00:15:29,600 --> 00:15:30,800
and grew up together.

313
00:15:30,980 --> 00:15:35,240
If anyone has the right to speak with confidence, it's me, Qin Siyao, not her!

314
00:15:35,240 --> 00:15:36,030
In terms of family background,

315
00:15:36,030 --> 00:15:36,720
grades,

316
00:15:36,720 --> 00:15:37,240
and looks,

317
00:15:37,240 --> 00:15:38,720
how am I inferior to her in any way?

318
00:15:38,720 --> 00:15:41,080
I have never judged someone's worth

319
00:15:41,080 --> 00:15:42,460
based on material things,

320
00:15:42,460 --> 00:15:43,670
Moreover, you're too obsessive.

321
00:15:43,670 --> 00:15:44,270
The things you did...

322
00:15:44,270 --> 00:15:45,000
The things I did,

323
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:46,720
don't you know why I did them?

324
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:57,030
So I'm sorry

325
00:16:01,990 --> 00:16:02,920
that you like me.

326
00:16:05,080 --> 00:16:06,880
All you have for me is an apology?

327
00:16:09,080 --> 00:16:11,010
Then what do you feel for Yu Mingxi?

328
00:16:11,630 --> 00:16:12,890
None of your business.

329
00:16:16,630 --> 00:16:17,440
Jiang Bohan!

330
00:16:18,030 --> 00:16:18,910
If you dare to like her,

331
00:16:18,910 --> 00:16:20,390
I'll never let her off!

332
00:16:43,430 --> 00:16:44,630
Go ahead and try then.

333
00:16:50,730 --> 00:16:54,960
[Close to You]
