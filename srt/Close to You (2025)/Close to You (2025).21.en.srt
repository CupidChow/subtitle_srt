I'm the stain in her past

192
00:11:30,270 --> 00:11:32,800
that makes her hang her head in her new family.

193
00:11:33,150 --> 00:11:34,680
And I'm not thick-skinned,

194
00:11:35,030 --> 00:11:36,030
so eventually...

195
00:11:36,440 --> 00:11:37,840
I stopped bothering her.

196
00:11:39,030 --> 00:11:39,810
So...

197
00:11:40,720 --> 00:11:43,410
you went to live with Yu Mingxi's family

198
00:11:44,600 --> 00:11:46,000
just to make it up to them?

199
00:11:50,190 --> 00:11:51,320
Make it up to them...

200
00:11:54,930 --> 00:11:56,460
It'd be hard to ever do that.

201
00:11:58,080 --> 00:11:59,140
Besides those two,

202
00:12:00,080 --> 00:12:01,360
I've got

203
00:12:02,110 --> 00:12:03,510
no one else in this world.

204
00:12:04,760 --> 00:12:06,620
I also don't know where else to go.

205
00:12:15,240 --> 00:12:17,370
You fought in those boxing matches...

206
00:12:18,120 --> 00:12:20,120
to help them pay off the debt, right?

207
00:12:23,440 --> 00:12:24,170
I did before,

208
00:12:25,150 --> 00:12:26,080
but not anymore.

209
00:12:29,120 --> 00:12:31,270
I didn't expect those high heels to be so expensive.

210
00:12:31,270 --> 00:12:33,530
It cost me two months' salary in advance.

211
00:12:37,840 --> 00:12:38,700
No matter what,

212
00:12:39,120 --> 00:12:40,580
she can't know about this.

213
00:12:45,600 --> 00:12:47,200
Don't go out boxing anymore.

214
00:12:49,080 --> 00:12:50,140
As for the money...

215
00:12:51,710 --> 00:12:52,840
I'll take care of it.

216
00:12:54,150 --> 00:12:55,680
What are you talking about?

217
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:57,860
What does this have to do with you?

218
00:12:58,550 --> 00:13:00,680
Don't take everything upon yourself.

219
00:13:01,540 --> 00:13:03,740
How does this have nothing to do with me?

220
00:13:05,240 --> 00:13:06,500
I care about Yu Mingxi.

221
00:13:08,320 --> 00:13:09,450
She cares about you.

222
00:13:13,800 --> 00:13:16,260
Consider this as me caring about both of you.

223
00:13:22,470 --> 00:13:23,630
You still want your Coke or not?

224
00:13:23,630 --> 00:13:24,760
If not, give it to me.

225
00:13:40,090 --> 00:13:41,750
You don't need to send me home.

226
00:13:42,860 --> 00:13:44,520
Who said I'm sending you home?

227
00:13:46,370 --> 00:13:47,890
I'm here to see Yu Mingxi.

228
00:13:49,320 --> 00:13:50,270
Hands off.

229
00:13:51,050 --> 00:13:52,050
No respect at all.

230
00:13:54,030 --> 00:13:56,940
Yu Mingxi has always treated you like her own brother.

231
00:13:56,940 --> 00:13:58,910
So shouldn't you call me...

232
00:13:59,660 --> 00:14:00,790
"Brother-in-law?"

233
00:14:02,270 --> 00:14:04,330
Wait until it's official to say that.

234
00:14:09,360 --> 00:14:11,760
-Why did you come out?
-Why did you come out?

235
00:14:11,980 --> 00:14:12,490
I...

236
00:14:19,410 --> 00:14:20,940
Did you two get into a fight?

237
00:14:23,030 --> 00:14:23,840
Well...

238
00:14:26,150 --> 00:14:26,840
We just...

239
00:14:27,390 --> 00:14:28,520
had a little scuffle,

240
00:14:28,520 --> 00:14:29,720
but we've already...

241
00:14:30,370 --> 00:14:30,890
made up.

242
00:14:31,480 --> 00:14:32,010
It hurts!

243
00:14:33,710 --> 00:14:34,590
What's wrong?

244
00:14:36,390 --> 00:14:37,450
Where does it hurt?

245
00:14:38,730 --> 00:14:39,590
I hurt all over.

246
00:14:40,820 --> 00:14:41,910
Everywhere hurts.

247
00:14:41,930 --> 00:14:43,010
Why did you hit him?

248
00:14:43,380 --> 00:14:44,230
Come on, let's go home.

249
00:14:44,230 --> 00:14:44,740
Okay.

250
00:15:02,150 --> 00:15:03,610
What's with your clothes?

251
00:15:08,320 --> 00:15:10,850
I accidentally spilled Coke on them earlier.

252
00:15:11,630 --> 00:15:12,430
Take them off.

253
00:15:12,870 --> 00:15:13,300
Why?

254
00:15:13,870 --> 00:15:15,030
They're all dirty.

255
00:15:15,660 --> 00:15:16,300
It's fine.

256
00:15:16,440 --> 00:15:17,720
I'll wash them myself when I have time.

257
00:15:17,720 --> 00:15:18,270
Now!

258
00:15:19,890 --> 00:15:20,420
Alright.

259
00:15:23,910 --> 00:15:25,020
Doesn't he have hands of his own?

260
00:15:25,020 --> 00:15:27,150
Why do you need to wash his clothes for him?

261
00:15:27,150 --> 00:15:28,810
They need to be washed anyway.

262
00:15:28,810 --> 00:15:30,210
Might as well save water.

263
00:15:31,870 --> 00:15:32,690
Jealous, aren't you?

264
00:15:32,690 --> 00:15:33,910
You Jingchu.

265
00:15:35,290 --> 00:15:36,130
How childish.

266
00:15:40,380 --> 00:15:41,840
What happened to your leg?

267
00:15:44,120 --> 00:15:44,920
It's nothing.

268
00:15:45,120 --> 00:15:47,050
I accidentally fell a few days ago.

269
00:15:47,320 --> 00:15:48,320
How did it happen?

270
00:15:49,630 --> 00:15:51,040
We were messing around a couple of days ago,

271
00:15:51,040 --> 00:15:53,570
and she accidentally bumped into something.

272
00:15:59,160 --> 00:15:59,590
Here.

273
00:16:05,270 --> 00:16:06,270
You Jingchu!

274
00:16:06,900 --> 00:16:08,700
Why are you all bruised up again?

275
00:16:10,800 --> 00:16:11,440
I'm fine.

276
00:16:11,460 --> 00:16:12,120
No big deal.

277
00:16:13,440 --> 00:16:15,640
Why do you always get yourself injured?

278
00:16:17,720 --> 00:16:18,880
It's because

279
00:16:18,910 --> 00:16:19,840
I have thin skin.

280
00:16:20,480 --> 00:16:21,680
I bruise like a peach.

281
00:16:21,960 --> 00:16:22,630
It looks worse than it actually is,

282
00:16:22,630 --> 00:16:24,290
but it doesn't hurt that much.

283
00:16:24,600 --> 00:16:26,080
I'm going to do the laundry now.

284
00:16:26,080 --> 00:16:26,630
Sit down.

285
00:16:26,890 --> 00:16:27,920
Let me put some ointment on you first.

286
00:16:27,920 --> 00:16:29,120
Give me your clothes.

287
00:16:54,030 --> 00:16:55,560
I'm not telling you all this

288
00:16:55,900 --> 00:16:57,540
to gain your sympathy...

289
00:16:59,510 --> 00:17:00,440
but to make you

290
00:17:01,240 --> 00:17:02,280
back off.

291
00:17:05,599 --> 00:17:06,530
What do you mean?

292
00:17:08,270 --> 00:17:10,200
You two are from different worlds.

293
00:17:10,960 --> 00:17:12,290
You can like her on a whim

294
00:17:12,440 --> 00:17:14,839
without thinking about the consequences.

295
00:17:15,109 --> 00:17:16,400
And even if you break up,

296
00:17:16,400 --> 00:17:17,310
you both go your separate ways

297
00:17:17,310 --> 00:17:17,920
amicably, and you think

298
00:17:17,920 --> 00:17:19,319
you can still be friends.

299
00:17:19,349 --> 00:17:20,069
But her?

300
00:17:21,869 --> 00:17:23,130
You can afford to lose,

301
00:17:23,480 --> 00:17:24,280
but she can't.

302
00:17:28,750 --> 00:17:30,310
I just hope the world

303
00:17:31,160 --> 00:17:32,640
can be a bit kinder to Yu Mingxi

304
00:17:32,640 --> 00:17:34,370
and let her be a little happier.

305
00:17:35,300 --> 00:17:37,100
This is my way of protecting her.

306
00:17:44,770 --> 00:17:45,510
Come sit here!

307
00:17:45,510 --> 00:17:47,170
Let me put some medicine on it!

308
00:17:47,330 --> 00:17:48,030
It's really nothing.

309
00:17:48,030 --> 00:17:49,490
It'll be fine in a few days.

310
00:17:49,790 --> 00:17:51,440
It's all bruised, and you say it's nothing?

311
00:17:51,440 --> 00:17:52,530
Where's the bruise?

312
00:17:52,530 --> 00:17:53,860
It's just the lighting.

313
00:17:56,680 --> 00:17:57,200
Corn,

314
00:17:57,960 --> 00:17:59,290
don't be angry anymore.

315
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:00,660
I was wrong.

316
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:04,750
Does it hurt?

317
00:18:05,440 --> 00:18:06,000
Nope.

318
00:18:06,270 --> 00:18:08,000
This little injury is nothing.

319
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:09,160
Then why did you act like it hurt so much

320
00:18:09,160 --> 00:18:10,560
when Jiang Bohan hit you?

321
00:18:12,680 --> 00:18:14,610
I was just pretending to upset him.

322
00:18:15,250 --> 00:18:15,660
Fine,

323
00:18:15,840 --> 00:18:17,380
you two are ganging up to annoy me, huh?

324
00:18:17,380 --> 00:18:18,680
Apply the ointment yourself.

325
00:18:18,680 --> 00:18:19,510
I was wrong, okay?

326
00:18:19,510 --> 00:18:20,220
I was wrong. I was wrong.

327
00:18:20,220 --> 00:18:21,600
Don't be mad anymore. Please.

328
00:18:21,600 --> 00:18:22,340
I was wrong.

329
00:18:25,680 --> 00:18:26,440
Keep acting.

330
00:18:26,990 --> 00:18:28,450
It really hurts this time.

331
00:18:29,370 --> 00:18:30,270
Really?

332
00:18:32,090 --> 00:18:33,090
I'm just kidding.

333
00:18:34,140 --> 00:18:35,720
You Jingchu, don't be so childish!

334
00:18:35,720 --> 00:18:36,620
This really hurts!

335
00:18:36,620 --> 00:18:37,480
That's what you get for fighting.

336
00:18:37,480 --> 00:18:38,680
Will you fight again?

337
00:18:39,070 --> 00:18:39,920
No, I won't.

338
00:18:39,950 --> 00:18:41,280
No more fighting, okay?

339
00:18:41,510 --> 00:18:42,440
I'm leaving now.

340
00:18:54,710 --> 00:18:58,930
[Close to You]
