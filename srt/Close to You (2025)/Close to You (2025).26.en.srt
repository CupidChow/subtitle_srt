00:00:20,120 --> 00:00:21,550
get you the heels

10
00:00:21,550 --> 00:00:23,190
so you could look all beautiful at the party.

11
00:00:23,190 --> 00:00:25,320
Everyone will be wearing heels there.

12
00:00:25,960 --> 00:00:27,010
Jiang Bohan is so tall.

13
00:00:27,010 --> 00:00:28,070

Can you come out and take a look?

18
00:00:37,030 --> 00:00:38,430
I can't handle it myself.

19
00:00:38,960 --> 00:00:41,020
It's not going to be incurable, is it?

20
00:00:42,640 --> 00:00:44,070
If this turns into a fungal infection,

21
00:00:44,070 --> 00:00:45,790
you'll have to take me to get a manicure.

22
00:00:45,790 --> 00:00:48,320
I'm afraid people will notice and laugh at me.

23
00:00:51,110 --> 00:00:53,770
I won't even be able to wear slippers after this.

25
00:01:10,120 --> 00:01:11,760
it's just a pair of high heels, isn't it?

26
00:01:11,760 --> 00:01:13,020
It's not that serious.

27
00:01:17,510 --> 00:01:18,150

run faster.

188
00:15:56,720 --> 00:15:57,940
Only two minutes left.

189
00:15:57,940 --> 00:15:58,690
Run quickly!

190
00:16:06,080 --> 00:16:06,670
Mingxi.

191
00:16:16,290 --> 00:16:17,010
Dad?

192
00:16:17,790 --> 00:16:18,590
What's wrong?

193
00:16:18,670 --> 00:16:20,600
Your shoelaces came undone again?

194
00:16:20,700 --> 00:16:22,160
Didn't I teach you before?

195
00:16:27,960 --> 00:16:29,020
Tie them like this,

196
00:16:29,360 --> 00:16:31,160
and they won't come loose again.

197
00:16:34,390 --> 00:16:34,870
Mingxi,

198
00:16:35,670 --> 00:16:36,320
come on.

199
00:16:37,360 --> 00:16:37,910
Go for it.

200
00:16:55,430 --> 00:16:57,580
There's nothing special about a marathon.

201
00:16:57,580 --> 00:16:59,040
Dad is here to protect you.

202
00:17:10,569 --> 00:17:12,690
In the second half, Jingcai mounted a strong comeback

203
00:17:12,690 --> 00:17:14,349
and gradually closed the gap.

204
00:17:14,410 --> 00:17:16,380
But time is running out.

205
00:17:17,359 --> 00:17:19,359
They're still three points behind.

206
00:17:20,069 --> 00:17:21,829
These final 10.4 seconds

207
00:17:21,920 --> 00:17:24,190
will decide who takes home the championship title

208
00:17:24,190 --> 00:17:25,910
in this year's league.

209
00:17:40,230 --> 00:17:40,790
Captain,

210
00:17:42,240 --> 00:17:43,050
let me play.

211
00:17:44,640 --> 00:17:45,830
It's the last game.

212
00:17:47,130 --> 00:17:48,990
Can you let me finish it standing?

213
00:17:56,830 --> 00:17:57,660
Chen Sujie,

214
00:18:04,260 --> 00:18:05,810
you're in for the final attack.

215
00:18:05,810 --> 00:18:07,210
I'll pass the ball to you.

216
00:18:09,500 --> 00:18:10,110
Alright.

217
00:18:16,930 --> 00:18:20,670
[Close to You]
