1
00:00:08,960 --> 00:00:11,080
You have to agree to one condition first.

2
00:00:11,080 --> 00:00:12,640
You're trying to take advantage of this.

3
00:00:12,640 --> 00:00:13,100
Then...

4
00:00:18,480 --> 00:00:20,480
Tell me what the condition is first.

5
00:00:22,160 --> 00:00:24,420
Don't hide from me anymore in the future.

6
00:00:27,440 --> 00:00:27,920
Okay.

7
00:00:29,950 --> 00:00:31,880
Later, count to 60, and then go out.

8
00:00:32,450 --> 00:00:33,110
60 seconds?

9
00:00:33,380 --> 00:00:34,190
Trust me.

10
00:00:56,320 --> 00:00:58,470
Don't you still want to graduate on time?

11
00:00:58,470 --> 00:01:00,560
Do you still want to keep playing basketball?

12
00:01:00,560 --> 00:01:03,110
Can you stop making a big deal out of everything

13
00:01:03,110 --> 00:01:04,370
and being so dramatic?

14
00:01:04,900 --> 00:01:07,740
You'd rather sacrifice your future

15
00:01:07,760 --> 00:01:09,230
just to go against me?

16
00:01:09,640 --> 00:01:10,840
I'm an adult!

17
00:01:11,070 --> 00:01:13,420
I can take responsibility for my own future.

18
00:01:13,420 --> 00:01:15,370
With your flippant and carefree attitude,

19
00:01:15,370 --> 00:01:18,300
can you really take responsibility for your future?

20
00:01:24,230 --> 00:01:26,039
Go back abroad for summer vacation.

21
00:01:26,039 --> 00:01:27,310
Let your father manage you,

22
00:01:27,310 --> 00:01:28,950
and you can attend some team tryouts.

23
00:01:28,950 --> 00:01:29,350
No!

24
00:01:30,950 --> 00:01:33,070
If you don't want to follow my arrangement,

25
00:01:33,070 --> 00:01:34,720
then at least listen to your dad!

26
00:01:34,720 --> 00:01:35,310
No.

27
00:01:36,560 --> 00:01:38,490
I think things are fine as they are.

28
00:01:39,710 --> 00:01:41,240
Fine, do whatever you want.

29
00:01:42,229 --> 00:01:43,229
Get some rest!

30
00:01:51,680 --> 00:01:52,310
Let's go.

[EP. 9: Don't Hide from Me Anymore]

33
00:03:36,110 --> 00:03:36,630
Hello,

34
00:03:36,750 --> 00:03:37,280
Mingxi?

35
00:03:37,520 --> 00:03:38,050
Nian,

36
00:03:38,079 --> 00:03:38,880
where are you?

37
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:40,390
How about I come to you now?

38
00:03:40,390 --> 00:03:41,200
I'm...

39
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:43,030
I'm busy.

40
00:03:44,790 --> 00:03:45,920
I have to go now.

41
00:03:46,230 --> 00:03:46,680
Bye-bye.

42
00:03:46,680 --> 00:03:47,540
I'm hanging up.

43
00:03:55,670 --> 00:03:56,320
Did you...

44
00:03:56,910 --> 00:03:58,060
need something from me,

45
00:03:58,060 --> 00:03:58,570
Miss?

46
00:04:00,110 --> 00:04:01,440
I want to buy some books.

47
00:04:05,520 --> 00:04:08,000
"How to Stay Sober in Love?"

48
00:04:08,800 --> 00:04:09,930
I want it for Mingxi.

49
00:04:12,200 --> 00:04:15,250
"Sports Injuries and Rehabilitation."

50
00:04:16,660 --> 00:04:17,630
You're hurt?

51
00:04:23,140 --> 00:04:24,670
How did you injure your leg?

52
00:04:24,800 --> 00:04:25,980
Keep your voice down.

53
00:04:25,980 --> 00:04:27,330
No one heard us just now.

54
00:04:27,430 --> 00:04:28,630
We're in the library.

55
00:04:34,500 --> 00:04:34,980
But...

56
00:04:43,270 --> 00:04:44,470
Why did you follow me?

57
00:04:44,630 --> 00:04:45,270
I didn't.

58
00:04:45,880 --> 00:04:46,540
You didn't?

59
00:04:47,720 --> 00:04:49,180
Then how do you prove that?

60
00:04:50,390 --> 00:04:52,120
Then how do you prove that I did?

61
00:05:04,870 --> 00:05:06,070
Good enough as proof?

62
00:05:07,550 --> 00:05:08,810
Kinda cute, actually.

63
00:05:16,160 --> 00:05:16,870
I heard...

64
00:05:27,370 --> 00:05:30,230
you wrote love letters to a bunch of guys on our team.

65
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:34,390
Yes.

66
00:05:39,270 --> 00:05:40,270
I'm very curious.

67
00:05:41,850 --> 00:05:42,680
How do you manage to

68
00:05:42,680 --> 00:05:45,610
write love letters to so many people at the same time?

69
00:05:48,120 --> 00:05:49,580
You don't know how painful

70
00:05:50,600 --> 00:05:52,830
it is to be rejected by someone you like.

71
00:05:53,950 --> 00:05:54,390
So,

72
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:57,800
I split my feelings into smaller pieces and shared them around.

73
00:05:57,800 --> 00:05:59,120
That way, if I get hurt,

74
00:05:59,120 --> 00:06:01,050
it doesn't hurt as much all at once.

75
00:06:04,310 --> 00:06:07,370
I don't have the confidence to make anyone like me back.

76
00:06:08,040 --> 00:06:09,310
No expectations

77
00:06:09,830 --> 00:06:11,290
means no disappointment.

78
00:06:11,630 --> 00:06:12,630
I like you...

79
00:06:14,880 --> 00:06:15,340
all,

80
00:06:16,240 --> 00:06:17,300
and that's enough.

81
00:06:38,390 --> 00:06:39,159
When did you

82
00:06:39,159 --> 00:06:40,870
start liking that flavor?

83
00:06:42,070 --> 00:06:43,120
I like it now.

84
00:07:11,140 --> 00:07:12,940
Jiang Bohan, what are you doing?

85
00:07:13,180 --> 00:07:14,660
My mom asked me to change my clothes.

86
00:07:14,660 --> 00:07:16,320
I can't go out to change, can I?

87
00:07:41,820 --> 00:07:42,630
Mingxi,

88
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:44,750
why are you here so late?

89
00:07:44,880 --> 00:07:46,159
If I hadn't been here,

90
00:07:46,159 --> 00:07:48,070
I wouldn't have known that you were with Chen Sujie.

91
00:07:48,070 --> 00:07:48,560
Spill it.

92
00:07:48,560 --> 00:07:49,490
What's going on?

93
00:07:50,360 --> 00:07:52,560
We really did just bump into each other.

94
00:07:53,630 --> 00:07:54,830
Bump into each other.

95
00:07:56,040 --> 00:07:57,920
I don't remember seeing Chen Sujie's name

96
00:07:57,920 --> 00:08:00,450
when you asked me to write those love letters.

97
00:08:02,190 --> 00:08:04,180
There are so many boys on the basketball team.

98
00:08:04,180 --> 00:08:05,580
Who do you actually like?

99
00:08:06,550 --> 00:08:08,460
I like all the good-looking ones.

100
00:08:08,680 --> 00:08:09,940
Any problem with that?

101
00:08:10,190 --> 00:08:11,190
Fine, fine.

102
00:08:13,450 --> 00:08:14,510
By the way, Mingxi,

103
00:08:14,950 --> 00:08:17,630
earlier you asked me to go with you to find Jiang Bohan.

104
00:08:17,630 --> 00:08:18,630
Why?

105
00:08:19,230 --> 00:08:19,840
He...

106
00:08:19,860 --> 00:08:20,770
left his phone with me.

107
00:08:20,770 --> 00:08:22,100
I was going to return it.

108
00:08:24,070 --> 00:08:24,670
Wait a sec.

109
00:08:25,460 --> 00:08:26,120
His home...

110
00:08:26,830 --> 00:08:28,490
How do you know where he lives?

111
00:08:30,070 --> 00:08:31,510
You two...

112
00:08:31,530 --> 00:08:31,920
No!

113
00:08:31,950 --> 00:08:32,240
Never mind.

114
00:08:32,240 --> 00:08:32,789
Let's go home.

115
00:08:32,789 --> 00:08:33,850
It's going to rain!

116
00:08:41,809 --> 00:08:45,000
[Talk to Bohan tomorrow. I'm really exhausted.]

117
00:09:22,030 --> 00:09:23,980
Bohan still hasn't let go.

118
00:09:25,430 --> 00:09:27,640
Did I really do something wrong?

119
00:09:48,780 --> 00:09:49,270
Nian,

120
00:09:49,390 --> 00:09:50,120
I'm ready.

121
00:09:56,200 --> 00:09:56,750
Mingxi,

122
00:09:56,960 --> 00:09:57,870
you need to run faster.

123
00:09:57,870 --> 00:09:59,200
You're going to be late.

124
00:10:13,750 --> 00:10:14,830
Why are you here?

125
00:10:16,140 --> 00:10:17,070
Waiting for you.

126
00:10:21,330 --> 00:10:21,970
For me?

127
00:10:23,270 --> 00:10:25,400
You haven't had breakfast yet, right?

128
00:10:27,980 --> 00:10:28,650
Thank you.

129
00:10:29,790 --> 00:10:32,000
You run on an empty stomach every morning.

130
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:33,840
No wonder you have low blood sugar.

131
00:10:33,840 --> 00:10:35,440
I don't have time in the mornings.

132
00:10:35,440 --> 00:10:37,300
I usually eat once I get to school.

133
00:10:39,600 --> 00:10:40,330
Fair enough.

134
00:10:40,500 --> 00:10:43,160
It's late after you get off work at the convenience store.

135
00:10:43,160 --> 00:10:44,080
You worked hard,

136
00:10:44,080 --> 00:10:44,890
Yu Mingxi.

137
00:10:51,990 --> 00:10:53,050
I told you

138
00:10:53,080 --> 00:10:54,080
not to pat my head.

139
00:10:55,930 --> 00:10:56,650
Hop on.

140
00:10:56,730 --> 00:10:58,390
Give yourself a day off today.

141
00:11:02,450 --> 00:11:03,120
Come on,

142
00:11:03,120 --> 00:11:04,980
we will be late if you don't get on.

143
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:07,530

This isn't early enough?

162
00:12:51,190 --> 00:12:51,840
Fine.

163
00:12:52,120 --> 00:12:53,180
I'll be going then.

164
00:12:54,630 --> 00:12:56,160
You haven't thanked me yet.

165
00:12:56,910 --> 00:12:57,750
Thank you.

166
00:13:06,770 --> 00:13:07,240
Sorry,

I'll come pick you up after class!

168
00:13:08,080 --> 00:13:09,140
Class is starting!

169
00:13:27,710 --> 00:13:29,280
Check out my new bangs.

170
00:13:29,430 --> 00:13:30,030
Not bad,

171
00:13:30,030 --> 00:13:30,960
it's quite neat.

172
00:13:33,120 --> 00:13:34,380
Hand in your homework.

173
00:13:34,800 --> 00:13:36,730
Yu Mingxi, where is your homework?

174
00:13:44,560 --> 00:13:45,900
I clearly put it in here.

175
00:13:54,630 --> 00:13:55,390
Hurry up.

176
00:13:57,430 --> 00:13:58,290
I'm going to hand these in.

177
00:13:58,290 --> 00:14:00,080
Turn your homework in yourself when you find it.

178
00:14:00,080 --> 00:14:00,510
Okay.

179
00:14:03,840 --> 00:14:04,650
Mingxi,

180
00:14:04,900 --> 00:14:06,670
did you forget to do it or forget to bring it?

181
00:14:06,670 --> 00:14:08,200
I did it, but I can't find it.

182
00:14:17,550 --> 00:14:18,200
Yu Mingxi,

183
00:14:19,440 --> 00:14:22,640
your English grades have shown zero improvement lately.

184
00:14:23,360 --> 00:14:25,770
And you're not turning in your practical English paper either?

185
00:14:25,770 --> 00:14:26,550
Your English teacher

186
00:14:26,550 --> 00:14:28,350
has already reported this to me.

187
00:14:30,680 --> 00:14:31,370
Tell me.

188
00:14:33,600 --> 00:14:34,530
What's going on?

189
00:14:35,780 --> 00:14:36,690
I can't find it.

190
00:14:37,070 --> 00:14:39,240
Did you lose it, or did you simply not write it?

191
00:14:39,240 --> 00:14:41,300
Headmistress, I really did write it.

192
00:14:44,660 --> 00:14:46,390
What were you doing last night?

193
00:14:50,220 --> 00:14:50,980
I...

194
00:14:55,480 --> 00:14:57,480
Are you working part-time at night?

195
00:15:00,950 --> 00:15:02,110
And because of that,

196
00:15:02,220 --> 00:15:04,560
you didn't have time for your English paper?

197
00:15:04,560 --> 00:15:05,460
No, Headmistress,

198
00:15:05,460 --> 00:15:08,590
my part-time job's never gotten in the way of my studies.

199
00:15:09,740 --> 00:15:11,680
Do you still remember saying

200
00:15:11,870 --> 00:15:13,730
you wanted to earn a scholarship?

201
00:15:15,200 --> 00:15:16,260
Don't worry, Headmistress.

202
00:15:16,260 --> 00:15:17,750
I'll definitely do well in the midterms.

203
00:15:17,750 --> 00:15:18,880
Can you get A grades?

204
00:15:21,360 --> 00:15:22,160
Straight A's?

205
00:15:23,550 --> 00:15:24,960
Including English,

206
00:15:25,030 --> 00:15:26,570
you need at least five A grades.

207
00:15:26,570 --> 00:15:30,090
This is the most basic requirement for applying for a scholarship.

208
00:15:30,090 --> 00:15:30,760
No problem.

209
00:15:31,510 --> 00:15:32,590
You have my word, Headmistress.

210
00:15:32,590 --> 00:15:33,670
I will study hard.

211
00:15:35,590 --> 00:15:36,720
Go to your class teacher

212
00:15:36,720 --> 00:15:37,920
and get a new uniform.

213
00:15:39,610 --> 00:15:40,360
Headmistress,

214
00:15:40,360 --> 00:15:42,550
my clothes are fine.

215
00:15:43,080 --> 00:15:44,680
Just go get it like I told you.

216
00:15:44,720 --> 00:15:47,720
Looking sloppy like that affects the school's image.

217
00:15:48,030 --> 00:15:48,840
But,

218
00:15:49,240 --> 00:15:50,700
the cost of the uniform...

219
00:15:51,480 --> 00:15:52,440
This one's free.

220
00:15:53,320 --> 00:15:53,910
Really?

221
00:15:55,750 --> 00:15:56,450
Hurry now.

222
00:15:56,480 --> 00:15:57,790
Don't delay my work.

223
00:15:58,170 --> 00:15:59,630
Thank you, Headmistress!

224
00:16:00,520 --> 00:16:02,720
Turn in that English paper by tomorrow.

225
00:16:02,870 --> 00:16:03,440
Also,

226
00:16:04,550 --> 00:16:07,080
go pick up those fallen bikes in the bike shed.

227
00:16:08,080 --> 00:16:08,600
Goodbye.

228
00:16:08,600 --> 00:16:09,260
Go on, then.

229
00:16:34,220 --> 00:16:35,120
Yu Mingxi.

230
00:16:42,030 --> 00:16:44,550
I want you to disappear from my world.

231
00:16:54,790 --> 00:16:56,670
Our game has just begun.

232
00:17:03,500 --> 00:17:04,109
How nice,

233
00:17:04,130 --> 00:17:05,660
I have a new uniform to wear.

234
00:17:20,440 --> 00:17:21,040
Yu Mingxi?

235
00:17:21,839 --> 00:17:22,550
Qin Siyao,

236
00:17:22,609 --> 00:17:24,069
I was just looking for you.

237
00:17:24,270 --> 00:17:25,640
Yesterday was just a misunderstanding.

238
00:17:25,640 --> 00:17:26,480
I can explain.

239
00:17:36,860 --> 00:17:37,760
What do you want?

240
00:17:37,760 --> 00:17:39,090
I just came to tell you,

241
00:17:39,640 --> 00:17:42,240
don't think that Jiang Bohan really likes you.

242
00:17:42,250 --> 00:17:44,440
He's just never met someone as plain as you before.

243
00:17:44,440 --> 00:17:46,100
It's just a fleeting novelty.

244
00:17:46,440 --> 00:17:48,230
You should have some self-awareness.

245
00:17:48,230 --> 00:17:50,690
When did I ever say that Jiang Bohan liked me?

246
00:17:50,830 --> 00:17:51,770
Whatever grudge you two have,

247
00:17:51,770 --> 00:17:53,150
don't take it out on me!

248
00:17:53,170 --> 00:17:54,200
You really know how to play innocent,

249
00:17:54,200 --> 00:17:54,880
Yu Mingxi.

250
00:17:55,310 --> 00:17:55,750
No one is here.

251
00:17:55,750 --> 00:17:56,920
You can drop the act.

252
00:17:57,240 --> 00:17:58,170
I'm warning you,

253
00:17:58,440 --> 00:18:00,770
stop using dirty tricks to get close to Jiang Bohan.

254
00:18:00,770 --> 00:18:02,100
How am I playing innocent?

255
00:18:02,100 --> 00:18:03,560
What dirty trick did I use?

256
00:18:06,160 --> 00:18:06,790
Qin Siyao.

257
00:18:11,540 --> 00:18:12,640
Don't go too far.

258
00:18:22,790 --> 00:18:23,520
Jiang Bohan,

259
00:18:23,590 --> 00:18:24,440
if you're trying to piss me off,

260
00:18:24,440 --> 00:18:25,410
can you at least pick someone else?

261
00:18:25,410 --> 00:18:26,310
She has nothing!

262
00:18:26,310 --> 00:18:27,960
How is she better than me in any way?

263
00:18:27,960 --> 00:18:29,270
If you have a problem, come to me directly.

264
00:18:29,270 --> 00:18:30,290
Leave others out of it.

265
00:18:30,290 --> 00:18:32,080
Yu Mingxi has nothing to do with this.

266
00:18:32,080 --> 00:18:33,210
How does she not?

267
00:18:34,470 --> 00:18:35,800
If you keep ignoring me,

268
00:18:35,900 --> 00:18:36,900
I'll go after her.

269
00:18:37,030 --> 00:18:38,500
Qin Siyao, are you done yet?

270
00:18:38,500 --> 00:18:40,110
You think we all just sit around doing nothing like you?

271
00:18:40,110 --> 00:18:41,640
Can't you see that I'm busy?

272
00:18:42,320 --> 00:18:44,380
Can't you two settle this on your own?

273
00:18:54,550 --> 00:18:56,010
You want to say something?

274
00:18:57,160 --> 00:18:58,290
Here's your chance.

275
00:19:00,910 --> 00:19:01,670
Come with me.
