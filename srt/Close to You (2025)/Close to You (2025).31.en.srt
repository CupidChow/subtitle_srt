1
00:00:06,670 --> 00:00:07,630
It's really you.

2
00:00:08,640 --> 00:00:10,040
Qin Siyao, are you crazy?

3
00:00:11,030 --> 00:00:11,640
What's wrong with me?

4
00:00:11,640 --> 00:00:13,170
Do you know this is illegal?

5
00:00:13,400 --> 00:00:14,460
Where's the phone?

6
00:00:14,560 --> 00:00:15,430
What phone?

7
00:00:17,950 --> 00:00:18,950
Stop right there.

8
00:00:22,980 --> 00:00:24,440
You're still pretending.

9
00:00:25,350 --> 00:00:26,350
Oh, you mean this.

10
00:00:27,340 --> 00:00:28,340
I didn't take it.

11
00:00:28,880 --> 00:00:31,010
It was taken by Yu Mingxi's creditors.

12
00:00:31,480 --> 00:00:32,409
What creditors?

13
00:00:33,450 --> 00:00:34,910
Didn't Yu Mingxi tell you?

14
00:00:35,880 --> 00:00:37,320
She owes a ton of money.

15
00:00:38,310 --> 00:00:40,920
Those creditors installed cameras in her house,

16
00:00:40,920 --> 00:00:42,780
using the videos to threaten her.

17
00:00:47,110 --> 00:00:48,440
Did you know about this?

18
00:00:50,840 --> 00:00:52,370
Then why didn't you tell me?

19
00:00:52,740 --> 00:00:55,070
Do you think Mingxi would want you to know?

20
00:00:56,080 --> 00:00:57,930
Sort out your own problems.

21
00:00:58,860 --> 00:00:59,720
Leave me alone.

22
00:01:01,560 --> 00:01:02,490
Qin Siyao, stop!

23
00:01:08,070 --> 00:01:09,480
Why do you have their videos?

24
00:01:09,480 --> 00:01:10,680
Why should I tell you?

25
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:14,070
I think it was you who installed them.

26
00:01:15,240 --> 00:01:17,310
I can't be bothered explaining to you.

27
00:01:17,310 --> 00:01:18,370
Where's the phone?

28
00:01:18,950 --> 00:01:19,610
I burned it.

29
00:01:20,280 --> 00:01:22,480
Do you have any proof that you burned it?

30
00:01:23,840 --> 00:01:26,100
You won't believe me no matter what I say.

31
00:01:26,280 --> 00:01:27,940
I don't want to explain to you.

32
00:01:28,150 --> 00:01:28,680
Go away.

33
00:01:29,060 --> 00:01:30,590
You're not going anywhere.

34
00:01:30,860 --> 00:01:31,560
I've already told you.

35
00:01:31,560 --> 00:01:33,039
I don't have the phone.

36
00:01:36,220 --> 00:01:37,590
Explain yourself clearly first.

37
00:01:37,590 --> 00:01:39,050
I have nothing to explain.

38
00:01:39,150 --> 00:01:40,680
I didn't do anything wrong!

39
00:01:40,710 --> 00:01:41,870
Why don't you go ask Yu Mingxi?

40
00:01:41,870 --> 00:01:42,560
Why is she in debt?

41
00:01:42,560 --> 00:01:44,160
Why was she secretly filmed?

42
00:01:47,039 --> 00:01:48,070
Say that again.

43
00:01:48,590 --> 00:01:49,380
Let go of me!

44
00:01:49,840 --> 00:01:50,570
You Jingchu,

45
00:01:50,910 --> 00:01:52,610
let's get this straight first.

46
00:01:52,610 --> 00:01:53,430
Qin Siyao,

47
00:01:54,470 --> 00:01:55,479
hand over the phone.

48
00:01:55,479 --> 00:01:57,350
I don't have the phone. I burned it.

49
00:01:57,350 --> 00:01:58,450
Don't you understand?

50
00:01:58,450 --> 00:01:59,400
Get out, both of you!

51
00:01:59,400 --> 00:02:00,130
Give it to me!

52
00:02:00,610 --> 00:02:01,270
Let go of me.

53
00:02:01,430 --> 00:02:01,710
Let go!

54
00:02:01,710 --> 00:02:02,230
Don't you leave.

55
00:02:02,230 --> 00:02:02,870
Stop it.

56
00:02:02,920 --> 00:02:03,710
Let go!

57
00:02:04,620 --> 00:02:05,090
Let go!

58
00:02:05,680 --> 00:02:06,540
Don't touch me!

59
00:02:12,840 --> 00:02:13,470
Qin Siyao!

60
00:02:29,280 --> 00:02:30,360
How's Yao?

61
00:02:30,610 --> 00:02:31,910
I'm on my way.

62
00:02:33,120 --> 00:02:34,050
The doctor's...

63
00:02:34,710 --> 00:02:35,840
still treating her.

64
00:02:36,710 --> 00:02:38,360
We don't know her condition yet.

65
00:02:38,360 --> 00:02:38,960
Okay.

66
00:02:39,310 --> 00:02:40,579
Let me know if there's any news.

67
00:02:40,579 --> 00:02:41,640
I'll be there soon.

68
00:02:47,190 --> 00:02:47,800
Doctor,

69
00:02:47,960 --> 00:02:48,560
how is she?

70
00:02:49,030 --> 00:02:50,430
Everything else is fine,

71
00:02:50,660 --> 00:02:52,810
but the leg issue is quite serious.

72
00:02:53,210 --> 00:02:55,670
It's likely she won't be able to dance again.

73
00:03:02,460 --> 00:03:04,130
This isn't over between us.

74
00:03:30,260 --> 00:03:31,050
Mom.

75
00:03:32,230 --> 00:03:33,070
Lie down.

76
00:03:35,050 --> 00:03:36,380
What did the doctor say?

77
00:03:40,800 --> 00:03:41,360
Yao,

78
00:03:42,470 --> 00:03:43,190
tell me,

79
00:03:43,870 --> 00:03:44,870
what happened?

80
00:03:45,500 --> 00:03:46,780
Who pushed you?

81
00:03:50,390 --> 00:03:51,710
I've already called the police.

82
00:03:51,710 --> 00:03:54,710
The police will check the surveillance footage soon.

83
00:03:56,240 --> 00:03:57,430
I lost my balance

84
00:03:58,190 --> 00:03:59,560
and accidentally fell.

85
00:04:00,060 --> 00:04:01,220
At a time like this,

86
00:04:02,180 --> 00:04:03,420
you're still lying?

87
00:04:04,080 --> 00:04:05,540
Do I have to ask the police?

88
00:04:06,590 --> 00:04:07,430
Actually,

89
00:04:08,360 --> 00:04:11,000
they came to get that phone from me.

90
00:04:11,020 --> 00:04:11,610
It was me.

91
00:04:13,620 --> 00:04:14,590
The phone...

92
00:04:20,680 --> 00:04:21,800
The phone

93
00:04:23,630 --> 00:04:25,310
has photos of Yu Mingxi and me.

94
00:04:25,940 --> 00:04:27,270
I came to get it from her.

95
00:04:27,750 --> 00:04:29,510
During the struggle,

96
00:04:29,830 --> 00:04:32,230
I accidentally pushed her down the stairs.

97
00:04:32,360 --> 00:04:33,360
I'm sorry, ma'am.

98
00:04:33,770 --> 00:04:35,630
I will take full responsibility.

99
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:38,260
Full responsibility?

100
00:04:39,510 --> 00:04:41,770
Do you think money can solve everything?

101
00:04:42,070 --> 00:04:45,000
Do you think your mother can clean up all your messes?

102
00:04:45,720 --> 00:04:47,840
Yao will never be able to dance again.

103
00:04:48,430 --> 00:04:50,360
Can you bear that responsibility?

104
00:04:50,450 --> 00:04:51,070
Mom.

105
00:04:52,990 --> 00:04:53,920
What did you say?

106
00:05:06,670 --> 00:05:07,220
I said,

107
00:05:07,750 --> 00:05:08,680
this is not over.

108
00:05:09,160 --> 00:05:11,090
I'll see you at the police station.

Mom.

110
00:05:22,960 --> 00:05:24,360
Don't blame Jiang Bohan.

111
00:05:29,480 --> 00:05:30,040
Yao,

112
00:05:31,750 --> 00:05:33,310
you're just too kind.

113
00:05:35,120 --> 00:05:36,650
In your current condition,

114
00:05:36,750 --> 00:05:38,409
what will you do in the future?

115
00:05:45,680 --> 00:05:46,159
I...

116
00:05:54,620 --> 00:05:55,350
Jiang Bohan,

117
00:05:57,040 --> 00:06:00,360
you're just getting carried away because Yao likes you.

118
00:06:03,870 --> 00:06:05,960
There is indeed something wrong with your mother's education.

119
00:06:05,960 --> 00:06:07,000
Neither of

00:06:07,630 --> 00:06:08,890

This accident

122
00:06:18,840 --> 00:06:20,160
was caused by me.

123
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:23,860
Whatever compensation you need,

124
00:06:24,310 --> 00:06:25,640
please feel free to ask.

125
00:06:27,950 --> 00:06:29,080
I'll agree to it all.

126
00:06:31,750 --> 00:06:34,230
But this has nothing to do with my mother.

127
00:06:37,270 --> 00:06:39,070
If there's any issue, come to me.

128
00:06:43,600 --> 00:06:45,400
I'll take full responsibility.

[Episode 31 This Time Let Me Get Closer to You]

131
00:07:57,480 --> 00:07:59,740
Qin Siyao's mother has finally relented

132
00:07:59,850 --> 00:08:01,050
and agreed to settle.

133
00:08:01,720 --> 00:08:03,120
But on one condition that

134
00:08:04,190 --> 00:08:07,160
you must accompany Yao abroad for medical treatment.

135
00:08:07,160 --> 00:08:08,370
And during this time,

136
00:08:08,600 --> 00:08:11,000
you cannot have any contact with Yu Mingxi.

137
00:08:11,310 --> 00:08:12,000
Her mother

138
00:08:12,460 --> 00:08:14,390
is afraid Yao might be upset again.

00:08:18,300 --> 00:08:18,890
This

140
00:08:19,390 --> 00:08:21,850
is the termination agreement with the team.

This is your passport.

142
00:08:27,310 --> 00:08:28,310
It's your choice.

143
00:08:29,920 --> 00:08:32,320
Either stay here to bear the consequences
