1
00:00:32,866 --> 00:00:35,326
It's been a long time.

2
00:00:36,202 --> 00:00:39,873
Many of you remember
the first time I met her.

3
00:00:41,624 --> 00:00:44,544
I got beat up a lot by her.

4
00:00:44,627 --> 00:00:46,921
I think I may have sustained brain injury

5
00:00:47,005 --> 00:00:50,258
since I still can't memorize
my home phone number.

6
00:00:51,259 --> 00:00:54,304
Remember when I first met her?

7
00:00:55,263 --> 00:01:00,477
Well, one day, she declared
there's no such thing as fate

8
00:01:00,560 --> 00:01:03,313
and with that, she was gone.

9
00:01:14,908 --> 00:01:16,493
ALL IS VANITY

10
00:01:19,245 --> 00:01:24,834
My love is gone.
The love of my life is gone.

11
00:01:25,293 --> 00:01:27,754
Give me that. I'll take it. Hold this.

12
00:01:29,297 --> 00:01:31,466
He got dumped by his girlfriend.

13
00:01:34,093 --> 00:01:35,136
Thank you.

14
00:01:40,558 --> 00:01:41,976
"All is vanity."

15
00:01:43,603 --> 00:01:44,604
What?

16
00:01:45,355 --> 00:01:46,981
"All is vanity."

17
00:01:48,358 --> 00:01:50,318
What does that mean?

18
00:01:50,401 --> 00:01:53,613
All is illusion.

19
00:01:59,661 --> 00:02:02,372
That's what that meant.

20
00:02:08,128 --> 00:02:11,339
I never knew the meaning all this while.

21
00:02:12,674 --> 00:02:16,719
And our destiny together ended,
just like a dream.

22
00:02:18,847 --> 00:02:24,519
MY NEW SASSY GIRL

23
00:02:25,186 --> 00:02:28,523
A FEW YEARS LATER

24
00:02:30,316 --> 00:02:35,363
What a bunch of losers.
What am I going to do with you fools?

25
00:02:36,573 --> 00:02:37,657
Hey, Full-Time.

26
00:02:38,074 --> 00:02:40,368
"Full-Time"? Did you change your name?

27
00:02:40,451 --> 00:02:42,287
He just got a job. A full-time job.

28
00:02:42,370 --> 00:02:46,040
Nothing like a hard day's work
to make a man out of you all.

29
00:02:46,124 --> 00:02:48,209
I should know, now that I'm employed.

30
00:02:48,293 --> 00:02:51,379
-What? You think we're lazy?
-Right.

31
00:02:51,462 --> 00:02:53,464
Kyun-woo, isn't that right?

32
00:02:57,886 --> 00:02:59,888
Whatever, you dipshits.

33
00:03:00,638 --> 00:03:06,895
Girls? Job? It's all an illusion.

34
00:03:08,187 --> 00:03:10,773
Here's takoyaki, on the house.

35
00:03:11,149 --> 00:03:15,028
-Thank you.
-Thank you.

36
00:03:20,491 --> 00:03:25,330
Why? Why would you give me
something like this?

37
00:03:25,413 --> 00:03:27,206
What's the matter?

38
00:03:27,332 --> 00:03:33,630
I never said I wanted this. Why?
It's all round. Round, I say, round.

39
00:03:56,069 --> 00:03:57,070
Hey!

40
00:04:13,044 --> 00:04:15,463
INCHEON STATION
(CHINATOWN)

41
00:04:15,546 --> 00:04:17,465
Damn! It's cold.

42
00:04:24,430 --> 00:04:26,766
-Hello?
-You little ingrate.

43
00:04:27,433 --> 00:04:29,352
Mom?

44
00:04:29,435 --> 00:04:32,313
Yes, this is your mother.
I am in the hospital

45
00:04:32,397 --> 00:04:35,358
and I can't even reach you.
Where the hell are you?

46
00:04:35,441 --> 00:04:37,068
You're my only son

47
00:04:37,151 --> 00:04:39,654
and you're not worried about me?
You ungrateful jerk.

48
00:04:39,737 --> 00:04:41,572
What's the point of having children?

49
00:04:41,656 --> 00:04:45,326
Mom, I'm on my way to see you.

50
00:04:45,410 --> 00:04:46,911
Then bring some fried chicken.

51
00:04:47,453 --> 00:04:49,372
But don't you have to pass gas first?

52
00:04:49,455 --> 00:04:50,748
I passed gas.

53
00:04:50,832 --> 00:04:53,001
That's why
I'm asking you to bring chicken.

54
00:05:02,302 --> 00:05:07,015
This is my son Kyun-woo.
Say hello to your aunties.

55
00:05:09,267 --> 00:05:12,145
What? He doesn't look
at all like Kim Soo-hyun.

56
00:05:12,228 --> 00:05:14,147
Does he really have an IQ of 160?

57
00:05:14,772 --> 00:05:17,692
He doesn't look like
he's popular with the girls.

58
00:05:20,778 --> 00:05:22,864
Kyun-woo, put this in the fridge.

59
00:05:23,614 --> 00:05:25,241
We're not done yet.

60
00:05:25,325 --> 00:05:26,701
We're done. You can all leave.

61
00:05:26,784 --> 00:05:27,702
What's wrong?

62
00:05:27,785 --> 00:05:30,747
My son brought me this
and you are eating all of them.

63
00:05:30,830 --> 00:05:32,623
Fine. It's all yours.

64
00:05:32,707 --> 00:05:33,833
Go on, get out of here.

65
00:05:33,916 --> 00:05:36,711
What's wrong with you?

66
00:05:36,794 --> 00:05:40,131
Hey, you've had enough. Go, go.

67
00:05:49,432 --> 00:05:50,433
Hey.

68
00:05:55,855 --> 00:05:57,982
Come here

69
00:06:02,403 --> 00:06:03,488
Who, me?

70
00:06:05,198 --> 00:06:06,240
Scratch.

71
00:06:15,875 --> 00:06:16,876
Are you Chinese?

72
00:06:16,959 --> 00:06:18,169
I'm itchy.

73
00:06:19,962 --> 00:06:21,464
My back.

74
00:06:21,923 --> 00:06:22,924
My back.

75
00:06:25,843 --> 00:06:29,847
I see. Now, let's see here…

76
00:06:30,973 --> 00:06:33,684
Down, down, down, down.

77
00:06:33,768 --> 00:06:34,811
Down.

78
00:06:34,894 --> 00:06:36,896
You mean "down"?

79
00:06:36,979 --> 00:06:38,106
Down.

80
00:06:38,189 --> 00:06:41,025
Up, up, up, up.

81
00:06:41,109 --> 00:06:43,069
You aren't cursing at me, are you?

82
00:06:43,611 --> 00:06:47,865
Left, left, left,

83
00:06:47,949 --> 00:06:49,826
right, right, right.

84
00:06:49,909 --> 00:06:51,994
Okay, here? Here?

85
00:06:54,914 --> 00:06:59,836
Is that better? Well, get well soon.

86
00:07:13,850 --> 00:07:15,935
Thank you, Pee Wee.

87
00:07:16,811 --> 00:07:18,980
Come on. Why Pee Wee?

88
00:07:22,733 --> 00:07:25,403
Wait. What is this?

89
00:07:26,404 --> 00:07:30,032
This feels like fate.

90
00:07:57,059 --> 00:07:58,060
Hey. Hey. Miss!

91
00:08:35,765 --> 00:08:38,768
DO NOT TOUCH

92
00:08:39,060 --> 00:08:42,355
You… You're…

93
00:08:42,438 --> 00:08:46,859
Want to know who she is?
She is someone from my childhood.

94
00:08:46,943 --> 00:08:49,529
How've you been, Pee Wee?

95
00:08:50,029 --> 00:08:51,447
My first love.

96
00:08:52,031 --> 00:08:55,952
Didn't I tell you to come find me?

97
00:08:58,079 --> 00:09:01,415
What is this familiar feeling?

98
00:09:02,041 --> 00:09:04,085
What are you doing? Hurry up.

99
00:09:06,087 --> 00:09:09,924
Come on down from there.

100
00:09:10,007 --> 00:09:11,509
Hello.

101
00:09:12,510 --> 00:09:13,970
Good morning.

102
00:09:17,014 --> 00:09:19,225
Kyun-woo. You know Master, right?
Say hello.

103
00:09:19,308 --> 00:09:20,142
Hello, sir.

104
00:09:20,226 --> 00:09:23,813
Kyun-woo. You both go to
the same school, right?

105
00:09:23,896 --> 00:09:26,732
This is my niece from China.
Please take good care of her.

106
00:09:26,816 --> 00:09:29,860
Kyun-woo, you're in the sixth grade.
He's older than you.

107
00:09:30,194 --> 00:09:36,325
She's a loner,
always looking into the sky.

108
00:09:37,827 --> 00:09:40,621
Call me big sister.
Then I'll help you carry it.

109
00:09:41,122 --> 00:09:42,748
It's not heavy at all.

110
00:09:59,432 --> 00:10:01,767
Look at him. Little Pee Wee.

111
00:10:01,851 --> 00:10:06,647
From that day on,
she only knew me as Pee Wee.

113
00:10:20,995 --> 00:10:21,996
Here.

114
00:10:30,838 --> 00:10:31,839
Little Pee Wee.

115
00:10:38,262 --> 00:10:43,100
She lost her parents.
So her uncle brought her here.

116
00:10:43,184 --> 00:10:47,480
Poor little girl. She must be so lonely.

117
00:10:48,022 --> 00:10:51,734
Kyun-woo, you should look after her.

118
00:10:51,817 --> 00:10:52,818
Yes.

119
00:10:54,111 --> 00:10:57,657
By the way, why does she
keep calling you Pee Wee?

120
00:10:59,158 --> 00:11:03,037
I… I don't know.
She doesn't speak Korean too well.

121
00:11:03,996 --> 00:11:06,999
She thinks Pee Wee means handsome.

122
00:11:07,083 --> 00:11:09,293
Really?

PHOTO STUDIO
ID, PASSPORT IN 3 MINUTES

124
00:11:25,810 --> 00:11:30,523
The girls who teased me
also wouldn't leave her alone.

125
00:11:30,731 --> 00:11:32,274
So… Where are your parents?

126
00:11:33,192 --> 00:11:36,278
Up there. Far away.

127
00:11:36,654 --> 00:11:38,697
Far away? Far away where?

128
00:11:39,407 --> 00:11:40,241
It's a secret.

129
00:11:40,324 --> 00:11:42,785
See? I knew it. You can't say it.
They're both dead.

130
00:11:42,868 --> 00:11:44,286
Ugly monster!

131
00:11:45,121 --> 00:11:46,080
What?

132
00:11:46,956 --> 00:11:47,957
You're ugly.

133
00:11:48,040 --> 00:11:50,251
What did you say?
I dare you to say it again!

134
00:11:50,334 --> 00:11:52,086
-What did you say?
-Are you kidding? I'll get you.

135
00:12:02,263 --> 00:12:04,223
Hey! You little bitches!

136
00:12:05,433 --> 00:12:06,434
Kyun-woo.

137
00:12:12,189 --> 00:12:15,234
Run! Let's get outta here!

138
00:12:43,888 --> 00:12:48,184
DO NOT TOUCH

139
00:12:48,267 --> 00:12:54,315
From that day on, we were known
as the "Do Not Touch" couple.

140
00:12:58,235 --> 00:13:01,197
-You wanna know a secret?
-A secret?

141
00:13:01,280 --> 00:13:05,201
-You see how my hair is shiny?
-Yes.

142
00:13:05,284 --> 00:13:09,205
-And my eyes are twinkling?
-Yes. Twinkling.

143
00:13:09,788 --> 00:13:16,337
That's because my mom and dad
are on that star. I need to go there.

144
00:13:17,338 --> 00:13:24,261
No wonder. But if you leave,
how will we meet again?

145
00:13:26,347 --> 00:13:29,350
Pee Wee, do you like me?

146
00:13:33,062 --> 00:13:34,230
I think so.

147
00:13:34,980 --> 00:13:38,359
I like you too. Then let's go together.
To my mom and dad.

148
00:13:39,401 --> 00:13:40,694
Together?

149
00:13:42,112 --> 00:13:45,783
I'll go there first.
You come find me. Promise?

150
00:13:46,825 --> 00:13:49,286
How will I get there?

151
00:13:50,788 --> 00:13:54,208
Pee Wee, I will never forget you.

152
00:13:54,291 --> 00:13:57,378
You're my bridegroom.

153
00:13:58,295 --> 00:14:04,343
Okay. But Pee Wee is not a good word.
Just call me Kyun-woo.

154
00:14:04,426 --> 00:14:08,430
Okay. Pee Wee Kyun-woo.

155
00:14:08,514 --> 00:14:10,140
Wo Ai Ni.

156
00:14:11,183 --> 00:14:14,353
"Wo Ai Ni"? What does that mean?

157
00:14:20,317 --> 00:14:24,363
It means you promise to come find me.

158
00:14:25,781 --> 00:14:30,452
Okay. I'll find you. Wo Ai Ni.

159
00:14:53,475 --> 00:14:57,354
Sadly, our first love…

160
00:14:57,980 --> 00:14:58,814
Wait!

161
00:14:58,898 --> 00:15:00,691
…did not blossom.

162
00:15:03,402 --> 00:15:05,362
-Kyun-woo.
-Stop!

163
00:15:05,446 --> 00:15:09,074
Kyun-woo. Don't forget me!
You have to come find me.

164
00:15:09,158 --> 00:15:10,409
Wait!

165
00:15:13,662 --> 00:15:16,916
You have to find me! Wo Ai Ni!

166
00:15:30,429 --> 00:15:34,433
I shed so many tears the day she left me.

167
00:15:35,392 --> 00:15:42,274
She was gone and I would look
into the skies, thinking of her.

168
00:15:45,861 --> 00:15:49,531
She was in town for a show.

169
00:15:49,615 --> 00:15:53,243
Doesn't she look cool
while working hard like that?

170
00:15:55,037 --> 00:16:00,834
It's like a dream, to have her back again
and my heart's beating so fast.

171
00:16:04,213 --> 00:16:08,759
You're so awesome.
So you're in Korea for a show?

172
00:16:09,551 --> 00:16:12,805
Yes. That and I came to get married.

173
00:16:15,474 --> 00:16:16,600
So, what do you do?

174
00:16:20,270 --> 00:16:23,691
Me? Well, I do a lot of things.

175
00:16:24,233 --> 00:16:25,567
You're a jobless loser.

176
00:16:26,610 --> 00:16:30,364
Where'd you learn expressions
like that? Don't say stuff like that.

177
00:16:32,032 --> 00:16:34,868
You can't get anything past her.

178
00:16:34,952 --> 00:16:38,622
Well, it's great then.
Since you have time,

179
00:16:38,706 --> 00:16:42,626
how about showing me around?
I want to explore Korea.

180
00:16:43,919 --> 00:16:47,881
A trip? I'll be your personal guide.

181
00:16:47,965 --> 00:16:49,466
-Leave it all to me.
-Great!

182
00:16:49,550 --> 00:16:53,470
How can a jobless loser explore Korea?
Where there's a will, there's a way.

183
00:16:53,554 --> 00:16:54,555
8 SCENIC SITES OF NONSAN
FREE TOUR TICKET

184
00:16:54,638 --> 00:16:57,516
Welcome, ladies and gents.

185
00:16:57,599 --> 00:17:00,477
I'm Suh, in charge of
your entertainment today.

186
00:17:00,561 --> 00:17:03,313
Now, everyone,
have you finished your snack?

187
00:17:03,397 --> 00:17:04,606
You call this food?

188
00:17:04,690 --> 00:17:07,776
Okay, now we are fast approaching
the eight scenic sites of Nonsan.

189
00:17:07,860 --> 00:17:10,571
To make things easier
for our elderly guests,

190
00:17:10,654 --> 00:17:14,450
let's all enjoy the view from the bus.

191
00:17:14,533 --> 00:17:17,786
Okay, now look over there.
That's Ongnyeobong Peak over there.

192
00:17:17,870 --> 00:17:19,997
That place is bursting with good energy.

193
00:17:20,080 --> 00:17:24,418
Look here. You drink from that spring
and your wrinkles will be gone.

194
00:17:24,501 --> 00:17:26,420
I never knew such places existed in Korea.

195
00:17:26,503 --> 00:17:28,172
-Everyone get a good look?
-Yes.

196
00:17:28,255 --> 00:17:30,215
Now, before we get to
our final destination.

197
00:17:30,299 --> 00:17:33,594
I love this. Thank you, thank you.

198
00:17:33,677 --> 00:17:36,555
We are going to stop by Geumsan
and discover a miracle tonic

199
00:17:36,638 --> 00:17:39,850
that's been developed for over 13 years
with a renowned hospital.

200
00:17:39,933 --> 00:17:40,768
Yes.

201
00:17:40,851 --> 00:17:44,229
All right. Why don't we enjoy
some music now?

202
00:17:44,313 --> 00:17:45,439
Let's go.

203
00:18:07,586 --> 00:18:10,547
Kyun-woo, where are you going?
I have to buy some more things.

204
00:18:10,631 --> 00:18:12,549
Let's go. Come on.

205
00:18:12,633 --> 00:18:14,635
What about the bus?

206
00:18:14,718 --> 00:18:20,015
We'll go broke if we get on that bus.
Let's hitch a ride back to Seoul.

207
00:18:20,099 --> 00:18:21,141
Follow me.

208
00:18:27,898 --> 00:18:28,899
Hey.

209
00:18:30,609 --> 00:18:33,612
Why are we going further into the woods?

210
00:18:35,739 --> 00:18:39,743
We just need to get over there
to get to the road.

211
00:18:44,706 --> 00:18:48,585
No cars or houses. Where are we?

212
00:18:48,669 --> 00:18:50,546
Are you sure you know where you're going?

213
00:18:50,629 --> 00:18:53,715
Of course. Just trust me.
Call me Mr. GPS. GPS Kyun-woo.

214
00:18:55,634 --> 00:18:57,636
The air is so cool.

215
00:18:58,887 --> 00:19:02,099
A ghost! It's a ghost!

216
00:19:02,724 --> 00:19:04,101
You okay?

217
00:19:10,524 --> 00:19:14,486
You hungry? Your stomach is growling.

218
00:19:14,570 --> 00:19:16,405
Why don't we drink some of this?

219
00:19:18,782 --> 00:19:21,785
It's gross. You can drink mine too.

220
00:19:25,205 --> 00:19:30,085
Kyun-woo, are you okay?
Are you sick? You're sweating.

221
00:19:30,169 --> 00:19:31,211
I'm okay. I'm fine.

222
00:19:32,087 --> 00:19:33,088
You don't look fine.

223
00:19:33,172 --> 00:19:35,424
I'm fine. I'm fine. I'm fine.

224
00:19:35,507 --> 00:19:36,550
Really?

225
00:19:39,887 --> 00:19:42,139
Kyun-woo! What is it? What's wrong?

226
00:19:42,222 --> 00:19:43,724
Are you sure you're okay?

227
00:19:43,807 --> 00:19:47,144
I'm okay. I'm good.

228
00:19:49,521 --> 00:19:51,231
MULBERRY JUICE

229
00:19:51,315 --> 00:19:53,066
Oh, man… Oh, man, oh, man…

230
00:19:53,150 --> 00:19:59,615
"Don't drink more than one serving a day.
Ten times more potent than Viagra…"

231
00:20:03,076 --> 00:20:04,578
Kyun-woo, what are you doing?

232
00:20:09,833 --> 00:20:12,044
Stop it, you're scaring me.

233
00:20:12,127 --> 00:20:16,131
I'm okay, I'm okay. Don't mind me.
Don't mind me.

234
00:20:16,965 --> 00:20:20,302
What are you doing? Watch
where your hands are going! Get off me.

235
00:20:20,385 --> 00:20:22,387
Just stay still…
Just a minute, will you…

236
00:20:49,623 --> 00:20:52,834
-Fantastic.
-"Fantastic"?

237
00:20:52,918 --> 00:20:58,131
Yes. I love it. The sky was our blanket.
The field was our bed.

238
00:20:58,215 --> 00:21:03,595
And that was our spa.
We really spent the night in a suite room.

239
00:21:06,848 --> 00:21:10,686
Look at that plane. Hi, I'm here!

240
00:21:10,769 --> 00:21:14,982
I'm sorry. I really wanted to
take you somewhere special.

241
00:21:20,362 --> 00:21:22,823
Why? I loved it.

242
00:21:23,824 --> 00:21:25,826
This is our first trip together,

243
00:21:26,535 --> 00:21:30,706
so I wanted to hold hands
like lovers do…

244
00:21:32,416 --> 00:21:35,752
Well, I mean… Never mind.

245
00:21:36,712 --> 00:21:39,881
I just wanted to make things
special for you.

246
00:21:41,466 --> 00:21:42,426
Really?

247
00:21:42,843 --> 00:21:47,889
Then, do you want to hold hands
and do something special?

248
00:21:49,891 --> 00:21:52,477
Yes, but right now?

249
00:21:52,853 --> 00:21:55,939
Yes, right now. Let's go.

250
00:21:56,648 --> 00:21:58,358
Wait. The jade rug, the jade rug.

251
00:21:58,442 --> 00:22:02,821
This is not what I had in mind!

252
00:22:56,041 --> 00:22:57,918
Kyun-woo!

253
00:22:58,710 --> 00:22:59,920
I'm here.

254
00:23:00,921 --> 00:23:02,005
Kyun-woo!

255
00:23:03,006 --> 00:23:03,965
Kyun-woo.

256
00:23:04,132 --> 00:23:06,218
Oh, God, no, no…

257
00:23:06,301 --> 00:23:07,511
Kyun-woo.

258
00:23:08,303 --> 00:23:10,680
You weak sauce.
How do you expect to marry me?

259
00:23:11,848 --> 00:23:13,141
What?

260
00:23:13,225 --> 00:23:16,937
Did I just hear her right? Marry her?

261
00:23:19,231 --> 00:23:24,861
What? Is the tonic taking its toll on you?

262
00:23:25,028 --> 00:23:26,363
No.

263
00:23:27,405 --> 00:23:32,661
Pee Wee, you're my bridegroom.
Don't you remember?

264
00:23:35,831 --> 00:23:38,375
Hello? Yes. I'm on my way.

265
00:23:38,458 --> 00:23:39,459
Mom,

266
00:23:41,002 --> 00:23:43,922
I think I'm getting married.

267
00:23:44,005 --> 00:23:47,884
Are you crazy? You're unemployed.
Who'd marry you?

268
00:23:47,968 --> 00:23:49,719
Stop this nonsense and get back here.

269
00:23:49,803 --> 00:23:51,096
She's right.

270
00:23:51,930 --> 00:23:55,976
But I can't let her,
my first true love, leave like this.

271
00:23:56,059 --> 00:23:58,979
I am the only man she's got.

272
00:23:59,646 --> 00:24:03,859
And I will give it everything.
I have to find a job.

273
00:24:16,496 --> 00:24:19,457
You see… Well, this is, you know…

274
00:24:20,959 --> 00:24:22,210
What did you do to your eyes?

275
00:24:24,087 --> 00:24:25,964
Well, it's just that this is…

276
00:24:26,047 --> 00:24:28,550
Who said you could lay
a finger on this face?

277
00:24:35,056 --> 00:24:38,226
I'm fine. It's all good. I'm fine.

278
00:24:38,310 --> 00:24:41,980
You don't understand.
You have no idea how hard this is.

279
00:24:42,981 --> 00:24:46,401
I've applied to many places
but I'm not getting any calls.

280
00:24:47,068 --> 00:24:50,780
And a lot of people get plastic surgery
for their job interviews these days.

281
00:24:51,573 --> 00:24:52,574
Plastic surgery?

282
00:24:53,783 --> 00:24:55,535
Yes, like this double-eye lid surgery.

283
00:25:00,707 --> 00:25:04,669
Double eyelid. How about a nose job
like this? And here…

284
00:25:06,671 --> 00:25:08,381
Hey, come on.

285
00:25:08,590 --> 00:25:13,011
See? Why do you need a job
before getting married?

286
00:25:13,094 --> 00:25:16,598
Let's get married first
and then you can look for a job.

287
00:25:17,140 --> 00:25:22,646
No. I just want to do things right.

288
00:25:23,521 --> 00:25:24,648
"Do things right"?

289
00:25:25,565 --> 00:25:28,652
Are you sure you're not making excuses?

290
00:25:28,735 --> 00:25:31,154
No. It's the truth.

291
00:25:33,365 --> 00:25:34,199
What's this?

292
00:25:34,282 --> 00:25:37,953

Hi, is this MTJ Telecom?
My name is Kyun-woo.

312
00:26:39,180 --> 00:26:41,850
I think I got the wrong text from you.

313
00:26:42,684 --> 00:26:46,313
I actually didn't apply for the position
but got an acceptance notice.

314
00:26:47,981 --> 00:26:48,857
Yes.

What?

318
00:27:10,962 --> 00:27:14,341
I got in
and I didn't even apply for the job.

319
00:27:15,300 --> 00:27:19,304
I applied for you.
I told you, you could do it.

320
00:27:23,266 --> 00:27:26,102
Thank you, thank you so much.

321
00:27:27,979 --> 00:27:33,234

345
00:29:51,289 --> 00:29:54,626

ILLGIKALITY

350
00:30:35,208 --> 00:30:37,335
Mom, what's wrong?

351
00:30:38,461 --> 00:30:41,297
I'm telling you she's not right.

352
00:30:41,673 --> 00:30:46,010
She'd never marry a loser like you.

353
00:30:46,094 --> 00:30:48,805
Mom, you said I'm not a loser.

354
00:30:48,888 --> 00:30:54,394
You are. She's too good for you.
Way too good for you.

355
00:30:55,478 --> 00:30:56,563
Mother.

356
00:30:57,313 --> 00:30:58,898
CHANGE THE MAN

357
00:30:58,982 --> 00:31:00,650
I'll take responsibility.

358
00:31:04,529 --> 00:31:05,572
Is it possible?

359
00:31:07,657 --> 00:31:08,700
It sure is.

360
00:31:16,040 --> 00:31:21,212
But this wasn't the end of our test.
We had one more obstacle to overcome.

361
00:31:24,549 --> 00:31:29,470
By the way, why do you use
such an old camera?

362
00:31:30,847 --> 00:31:32,307
I like using this camera.

363
00:31:32,515 --> 00:31:37,645
You can't tell if it came out okay
or delete it if you don't like it.

364
00:31:38,563 --> 00:31:45,486
Hey! One shouldn't delete photos
on a whim. They're all precious.

365
00:31:47,113 --> 00:31:48,364
I almost died up there.

366
00:31:48,448 --> 00:31:49,407
Hey.

367
00:31:50,450 --> 00:31:52,452
You scared me.

368
00:31:52,535 --> 00:31:53,494
Hey.

369
00:31:56,247 --> 00:31:58,541
There, over there. Village. A village.

370
00:31:59,500 --> 00:32:01,836
Is that where your grandfather is?

371
00:32:01,920 --> 00:32:05,256
Yes. My grandpa is there. Let's go!

372
00:32:08,885 --> 00:32:11,930
Man! I'm starving. I can't go any further.

373
00:32:12,013 --> 00:32:17,226
I'm hungry. Who am I talking to?

374
00:32:17,310 --> 00:32:19,103
I'm out of breath.

375
00:32:29,572 --> 00:32:30,657
Grandpa.

376
00:32:31,491 --> 00:32:32,450
Xing Xing.

377
00:32:37,997 --> 00:32:39,666
Grandpa.

378
00:32:41,584 --> 00:32:44,087
-I missed you.
-Welcome.

379
00:32:44,170 --> 00:32:50,426
This is Grandpa Zhig Zheet.
He calls her Xing Xing.

380
00:32:50,510 --> 00:32:53,096
Xing Xing means star.

381
00:32:54,055 --> 00:32:55,598
Grandpa, this is my bridegroom.

382
00:32:55,682 --> 00:32:58,726
The one I told you about
from when I was young.

383
00:33:02,355 --> 00:33:03,356
Hello.

384
00:33:11,114 --> 00:33:18,037
This glass bottle has a small opening
and a wider base.

385
00:33:18,121 --> 00:33:25,086
I found a baby bird who'd lost its mother
and I put her in here.

386
00:33:25,586 --> 00:33:30,633
When I tried to take her out,
she'd grown too big.

387
00:33:31,134 --> 00:33:34,595
How would you take the bird out

388
00:33:35,680 --> 00:33:39,350
without hurting it or the bottle?

389
00:33:40,643 --> 00:33:45,356
If you walk that way,
you'll find my friend's home.

390
00:33:45,440 --> 00:33:50,611
Think about this question
and tell me your answer then.

391
00:33:50,695 --> 00:33:54,365
If you get it right,
I'll allow this marriage.

392
00:33:57,118 --> 00:34:00,496
I'll see you there, Kyun-woo.

393
00:34:34,572 --> 00:34:36,824
This must be your answer.
All right, tell me.

394
00:34:36,908 --> 00:34:41,245
I really could not figure it out.

395
00:34:42,622 --> 00:34:47,335
But I began to think that the little bird
might have been lonely in here.

396
00:34:48,086 --> 00:34:53,257
So, to keep it company,
I put another small bird in the bottle.

397
00:34:55,259 --> 00:34:57,553
I thought of this
after I saw this drawing.

398
00:35:01,599 --> 00:35:06,604
These are the writings of the villagers.
Do you know its meaning?

399
00:35:08,439 --> 00:35:09,440
No, sir.

400
00:35:13,945 --> 00:35:17,365
This means love. Love.

401
00:35:23,162 --> 00:35:25,123
You really are my bridegroom!

402
00:35:29,752 --> 00:35:30,962
Please help yourself.

403
00:35:34,966 --> 00:35:36,676
Isn't my bridegroom handsome?

404
00:35:41,764 --> 00:35:44,058
MARRIAGE

405
00:35:44,559 --> 00:35:49,730
Full of luck. Grow old together.
Live long lives.

406
00:35:52,441 --> 00:35:54,652
Thank you.

407
00:36:08,833 --> 00:36:14,755
Have you seen such a beautiful wedding?
This is how we tied the knot.

408
00:36:15,548 --> 00:36:19,093
Grandpa, are you worried about me?

409
00:36:21,846 --> 00:36:24,724
Was his answer the wrong one?

410
00:36:27,685 --> 00:36:33,858
There is no right answer.
He found his own answer.

411
00:36:36,611 --> 00:36:37,528
Really?

412
00:36:40,489 --> 00:36:45,912
Yes. But, Xing Xing,
I have to ask you to remember.

413
00:36:47,914 --> 00:36:52,752
Life is about a journey together.
You both have to work together.

414
00:36:53,878 --> 00:37:00,801
You can't do it alone.
You understand this?

415
00:37:02,845 --> 00:37:06,057
I do. I also have you, Grandpa.

416
00:37:09,518 --> 00:37:11,687
Look at all the stars.

417
00:37:11,771 --> 00:37:14,065
Yes, the Milky Way.

418
00:37:16,317 --> 00:37:19,278
And remember my mom and dad's stars?

419
00:37:20,363 --> 00:37:21,280
Yes.

420
00:37:22,198 --> 00:37:25,785
Let's make a promise.

421
00:37:26,702 --> 00:37:27,787
Okay.

422
00:37:28,913 --> 00:37:34,835
No matter what, even if we fight,
let's never turn our backs on one another.

423
00:37:35,836 --> 00:37:38,381
Of course. That would never happen.

424
00:37:39,632 --> 00:37:43,719
Okay, but let's promise to count to ten
and we have to turn around

425
00:37:43,803 --> 00:37:47,056
before the count of ten. Okay?

426
00:37:47,765 --> 00:37:53,854
Of course. Here I seal
my promise and scan it.

427
00:38:31,684 --> 00:38:33,185
Oh, my!

428
00:38:57,668 --> 00:39:00,254
Now, those are our stars.

429
00:39:45,716 --> 00:39:49,053
At MTJ, we used
man's best friend to create

430
00:39:49,136 --> 00:39:54,600
a friendly and family-like image and logo.

431
00:39:56,644 --> 00:40:00,689
Look over here.
Do you know the MTJ slogan?

432
00:40:01,315 --> 00:40:02,733
You don't, right?

433
00:40:03,067 --> 00:40:04,443
It's "Home Sweet Home."

434
00:40:04,527 --> 00:40:07,321
We want our employees and
our customers to be like family…

435
00:40:07,405 --> 00:40:08,406
That's Yuko from HR.

436
00:40:08,489 --> 00:40:10,574
Graduated top of her class
from Keio University

437
00:40:10,658 --> 00:40:13,494
and despite numerous attempts to
woo her by male colleagues,

438
00:40:13,577 --> 00:40:15,121
she's never let anyone in.

439
00:40:16,038 --> 00:40:21,001
But fortresses were meant to be scaled.
And I am here to scale those walls.

440
00:40:23,879 --> 00:40:25,965
Hello, Mr. Kim.

441
00:40:26,632 --> 00:40:28,134
-New guys?
-Yes.

442
00:40:29,093 --> 00:40:31,053
Hello, Mr. Kim.

443
00:40:31,137 --> 00:40:36,267
You've all been very lucky to be accepted.
So let's test your luck today.

444
00:40:36,350 --> 00:40:41,564
Korean has 50 million people,
but 53 million mobile phone subscribers.

445
00:40:41,647 --> 00:40:45,568
That means anyone over the age of eight
has a mobile phone.

446
00:40:45,651 --> 00:40:48,028
Many have two phones.

447
00:40:48,112 --> 00:40:52,491
So can we say that market is oversaturated
and give up?

448
00:40:53,742 --> 00:40:59,790
Giving up is for losers. Never.
We must pioneer new frontiers.

449
00:40:59,874 --> 00:41:01,459
-That's right.
-Yes.

450
00:41:01,542 --> 00:41:04,587
So, what are the new frontiers?

451
00:41:10,009 --> 00:41:12,928
The new frontier is
the children of Korea.

452
00:41:13,971 --> 00:41:19,310
Put a thousand-dollar cell phone in their
snot-ridden, chubby little hands.

453
00:41:19,393 --> 00:41:23,522
Plant those seeds when they're young.
Young habits will die hard.

454
00:41:25,816 --> 00:41:27,359
What? Do you have an objection?

455
00:41:28,861 --> 00:41:32,072
I mean, well…

456
00:41:32,156 --> 00:41:36,118
The electromagnetic waves…
It would be really bad for them.

457
00:41:36,494 --> 00:41:39,997
A cell phone to a three-year-old…

458
00:41:40,372 --> 00:41:42,082
That's just nonsense.

459
00:41:42,166 --> 00:41:43,334
What department is he?

460
00:41:45,127 --> 00:41:47,379
The Oxford team.

461
00:41:48,088 --> 00:41:49,256
Oxford?

462
00:41:51,550 --> 00:41:55,721
How about writing an apology letter?
He'll have many to write very soon.

463
00:41:55,804 --> 00:41:57,097
Get some practice.

464
00:41:58,098 --> 00:42:00,059
Oxford, my ass.

465
00:42:02,144 --> 00:42:04,980
-Is there a Kyun-woo here?
-Yes?

466
00:42:05,064 --> 00:42:06,190
You have a package.

467
00:42:10,444 --> 00:42:11,612
Gosh.

468
00:42:15,991 --> 00:42:18,786
"Congratulations to my Kyun-woo's
first day at work."

469
00:42:24,959 --> 00:42:29,088
Did you get my gift?
Take a picture in front of it.

470
00:42:38,138 --> 00:42:40,975
-Take it, take it.
-You scared me.

471
00:42:43,060 --> 00:42:45,020
You've become famous on your first day.

472
00:42:46,605 --> 00:42:47,606
Yeah.

473
00:42:48,107 --> 00:42:49,692
Newlyweds?

474
00:42:51,110 --> 00:42:54,071
-Yes, it's been only a week.
-The best of times.

475
00:42:54,738 --> 00:42:56,824
By the way, we're the same age.

476
00:42:57,575 --> 00:42:58,993
No, really?

477
00:42:59,076 --> 00:43:02,329
It's true. I still have my baby fat.

478
00:43:03,205 --> 00:43:08,127
By the way, you need to get
the upper hand early on.

479
00:43:08,210 --> 00:43:09,128
Pardon me?

480
00:43:09,211 --> 00:43:11,463
Stop with the formalities,
we're the same age.

481
00:43:11,755 --> 00:43:13,924
Okay. All right.

482
00:43:16,927 --> 00:43:23,058
By the way, why are we the Oxford team?

483
00:43:25,686 --> 00:43:28,355
Did you go to Oxford?

484
00:43:29,148 --> 00:43:30,983
Oxford? I wish.

485
00:43:32,151 --> 00:43:37,323
Tired from a long day at work. But once
I'm home, I have to get my game on.

486
00:43:37,406 --> 00:43:40,367
My energy drink waits for me.

487
00:44:25,204 --> 00:44:28,207
Do you love me?

488
00:44:31,168 --> 00:44:32,670
Without knowing,

489
00:44:33,295 --> 00:44:39,218
I have fallen hopelessly for you.

490
00:44:43,222 --> 00:44:47,309
I am… a bad man.

491
00:44:50,562 --> 00:44:53,148
Stay with me tonight?

492
00:45:00,280 --> 00:45:02,199
My husband doesn't talk like that.

493
00:45:04,952 --> 00:45:05,994
Then how?

494
00:45:16,213 --> 00:45:18,257
Seduce me.

495
00:45:20,717 --> 00:45:22,803
Never mind. Let's get on with it.

496
00:45:22,886 --> 00:45:24,930
Did you not memorize everything?

497
00:45:25,013 --> 00:45:29,977
Stop goofing around.
No lines, no action.

498
00:45:30,060 --> 00:45:33,730
His mother didn't feel well
and went back to her mother's house.

499
00:45:36,733 --> 00:45:38,694
I did memorize everything.

500
00:45:38,777 --> 00:45:40,279
It's intense. No joke.

501
00:45:40,362 --> 00:45:43,282
Without a proper proposition
in the specified language,

502
00:45:43,365 --> 00:45:45,367
I can't even lay a finger on her.

503
00:46:04,386 --> 00:46:06,263
All right, let's do it.

504
00:46:08,307 --> 00:46:10,184
My beautiful girl.

505
00:46:10,267 --> 00:46:13,437
You are brighter and hotter than the sun.

506
00:46:13,520 --> 00:46:15,022
Come with me!

507
00:46:15,105 --> 00:46:18,275
I love you. I can't wait any longer.

508
00:46:19,651 --> 00:46:22,321
I love you so much.

509
00:46:26,325 --> 00:46:31,246
It is time to make you mine for eternity.

510
00:46:31,330 --> 00:46:33,248
Bravo.

511
00:46:45,344 --> 00:46:47,888
Tomorrow, it's Japanese.

512
00:46:47,971 --> 00:46:50,891
Are you kidding me?
Is your head just there as a decoration?

513
00:46:51,350 --> 00:46:55,312
You understand Korean?
You keep this up and you're out. Out!

514
00:46:57,356 --> 00:46:59,358
I apologize, sir.

515
00:47:21,421 --> 00:47:23,215
Yuko.

516
00:47:24,424 --> 00:47:25,717
How are you?

517
00:47:27,928 --> 00:47:30,347
Can I ask you something?

518
00:47:31,390 --> 00:47:32,349
Yes.

519
00:47:33,392 --> 00:47:35,519
What does this mean?

520
00:47:38,897 --> 00:47:40,482
"I knew it.

521
00:47:43,235 --> 00:47:47,531
That you were always waiting
to be found by someone."

522
00:47:56,415 --> 00:47:57,833
You're right.

523
00:47:59,126 --> 00:48:01,128
-What?
-What?

524
00:48:01,962 --> 00:48:05,173
What do you mean you knew?

525
00:48:07,467 --> 00:48:09,344
No. Never mind, Kyun-woo.

526
00:48:09,845 --> 00:48:11,388
Yuko.

527
00:48:12,431 --> 00:48:14,516
What'd I do?

528
00:48:15,434 --> 00:48:17,352
How are you?

529
00:48:19,271 --> 00:48:21,773
I'm fine.

530
00:48:24,109 --> 00:48:28,030
Today wasn't Japanese?
We're going Joseon dynasty style?

531
00:48:28,447 --> 00:48:31,325
I can dig that.

532
00:48:31,408 --> 00:48:33,744
Keeping it real and local.

533
00:48:34,411 --> 00:48:35,954
I'll change in a jiffy.

534
00:48:40,292 --> 00:48:44,796
Milady. Gonna make you pass out tonight.

535
00:48:49,176 --> 00:48:52,387
Mom? Mom, what are you doing here?

536
00:48:52,471 --> 00:48:55,307
"Pass out"? You foolish boy.

537
00:48:55,390 --> 00:48:57,976
Today's the anniversary
of your father's death.

538
00:48:58,060 --> 00:49:00,020
You selfish ingrate. My God.

539
00:49:00,103 --> 00:49:02,981
-Wait, that's today?
-That's right. Yes, yes.

540
00:49:03,065 --> 00:49:05,651
Calm down, Mother.

541
00:49:05,734 --> 00:49:10,155
From now on,
I'll make sure we never forget this day.

542
00:49:11,490 --> 00:49:17,329
My precious daughter.
I always said you're too good for him.

543
00:49:17,412 --> 00:49:18,747
That crazy fool.

544
00:49:21,458 --> 00:49:25,379
Hi, it's me. I'm going to China
on a last-minute business trip.

545
00:49:25,462 --> 00:49:27,464
You're going on a business trip?

546
00:49:27,547 --> 00:49:30,175
They said they really need me
for tomorrow's seminar.

547
00:49:31,551 --> 00:49:33,512
They say they can't do without me.

548
00:49:33,595 --> 00:49:36,431
I've always wanted to pack
for your business trip.

549
00:49:37,474 --> 00:49:38,433
Honey!

550
00:49:43,522 --> 00:49:47,651
Come on. How can I carry all this?
Where'd she go?

551
00:50:21,226 --> 00:50:25,480
Who could ask for a cuter, lovelier
cheerleader wife?

552
00:50:27,566 --> 00:50:28,608
Hooray for Kyun-woo!

553
00:50:29,693 --> 00:50:31,611
Hooray for Pee Wee!

554
00:50:32,487 --> 00:50:34,197
Kyun-woo! Hooray, hooray!

555
00:50:41,496 --> 00:50:42,497
Go, go, go, Pee Wee!

556
00:50:43,415 --> 00:50:45,500
I'll be back. Be back soon.

557
00:50:45,584 --> 00:50:51,465
Go, go, go, Pee Wee!

558
00:50:51,548 --> 00:50:53,425
Have a good trip!

559
00:51:06,521 --> 00:51:09,357
The seminar will start in one hour.

560
00:51:09,441 --> 00:51:12,694
So please prepare
before the guests arrive, okay?

561
00:51:16,573 --> 00:51:21,495
We will start soon.
Can you finish in time? Please hurry.

562
00:51:21,578 --> 00:51:22,496
Okay.

563
00:51:24,623 --> 00:51:27,584
Damn, where is Yong-sub?

564
00:51:31,087 --> 00:51:34,132
-Will you join us for the company dinner?
-Yes.

565
00:51:34,216 --> 00:51:36,593
-Do you like to drink?
-A little.

566
00:51:36,676 --> 00:51:38,929
-You have to join us, okay?
-Okay.

567
00:51:40,222 --> 00:51:42,682
I will finally get a chance
to scale those walls tonight.

568
00:51:42,974 --> 00:51:46,603
It's a company dinner…

569
00:51:51,650 --> 00:51:54,611
Honey. What're you doing?

570
00:51:55,570 --> 00:51:57,781
Stop thinking about me so much.

571
00:51:58,365 --> 00:51:59,783
You'll get hurt.

572
00:52:00,492 --> 00:52:01,618
Of course I won't make it.

573
00:52:02,035 --> 00:52:04,704
What're you wearing? What?

574
00:52:04,788 --> 00:52:07,123
I told you to always be naked
when we talk on the phone.

575
00:52:07,207 --> 00:52:09,042
Hey! Stop with this nonsense.

576
00:52:09,125 --> 00:52:10,126
I'm going to bed.

577
00:52:10,210 --> 00:52:12,671
Okay, okay. You love me that much?

578
00:52:13,171 --> 00:52:14,464
I love you too.

579
00:52:14,548 --> 00:52:16,675
Don't be too lonely without me.

580
00:52:17,801 --> 00:52:20,804
What are you doing. Honey?
Miss you!

581
00:52:24,516 --> 00:52:25,517
No view.

582
00:52:25,600 --> 00:52:28,562
Me, too.
You can see the beach, right?

583
00:52:28,645 --> 00:52:33,316
Yeah, it's cool. They booked
a great room with a nice view for me.

584
00:52:33,400 --> 00:52:36,403
I'm playing around on the beach too.

585
00:52:38,321 --> 00:52:41,867
I wanna be in the real beach.
And also, miss you.

586
00:52:41,950 --> 00:52:45,203
Can I come over? Anything I can help with?

587
00:52:45,287 --> 00:52:50,041
No, no. it's already done for today.
You don't need to come.

588
00:52:51,376 --> 00:52:57,757
I couldn't show her that all I got to do
was move boxes on this trip.

589
00:52:59,509 --> 00:53:02,554
Then write romantic poems on the beach
when the sun rises.

590
00:53:02,637 --> 00:53:04,973
As much as you love me. Super-size.

591
00:53:05,056 --> 00:53:07,559
How big should it be?

592
00:53:07,642 --> 00:53:12,230
Big enough so that I can see it from space
or on Google maps. Okay?

593
00:53:15,609 --> 00:53:16,610
Come on.

594
00:53:16,693 --> 00:53:19,654
Let's check out some mainland hotties.

595
00:53:19,738 --> 00:53:21,698
Nah, I'm too tired.

596
00:53:22,574 --> 00:53:25,035
And I have something to do
at the crack of dawn.

597
00:53:26,828 --> 00:53:28,580
We party until the crack of dawn, bro.

598
00:53:29,831 --> 00:53:31,875
-You go ahead.
-Come on.

599
00:53:34,878 --> 00:53:35,837
Who could that be?

600
00:53:54,397 --> 00:53:57,442
So… You're gonna stay in?

601
00:54:05,450 --> 00:54:12,040
It's hot tonight. Tonight is your night.

602
00:54:12,123 --> 00:54:16,169
I have a special gift for you.

603
00:54:26,805 --> 00:54:29,724
Kyun-woo, you're all grown up.

604
00:54:39,359 --> 00:54:40,860
Pee Wee!

605
00:54:42,821 --> 00:54:45,991
Pee Wee, I'm here.

606
00:54:49,619 --> 00:54:50,662
Honey!

607
00:55:15,854 --> 00:55:19,941
Hey, who are you?

608
00:55:20,900 --> 00:55:22,402
Where's Kyun-woo?

609
00:55:24,904 --> 00:55:27,907
Kyun-woo? Where is he?

610
00:55:37,959 --> 00:55:40,545
Who the hell are you?

611
00:56:00,899 --> 00:56:01,858
Honey!

612
00:56:03,943 --> 00:56:04,861
Honey.

613
00:56:12,619 --> 00:56:17,040
One all-nighter and I'm hearing voices.

614
00:56:23,880 --> 00:56:24,964
Pee Wee.

615
00:56:26,007 --> 00:56:30,136
My bridegroom. Thank you.

616
00:56:33,014 --> 00:56:35,391
You're really here?

617
00:56:36,935 --> 00:56:38,061
Let's take pictures.

618
00:56:47,028 --> 00:56:48,947
Hurry, the water is coming in.

619
00:57:04,045 --> 00:57:06,005
Is that all I get? Wo Ai Ni?

620
00:57:07,048 --> 00:57:08,967
Why, didn't you like it?

621
00:57:11,636 --> 00:57:13,972
I wanted a poem written in huge letters.

622
00:57:17,016 --> 00:57:19,519
Well, it was Wo Ai Ni
that brought you here.

623
00:57:21,062 --> 00:57:23,064
What do you mean?

624
00:57:24,107 --> 00:57:25,567
Don't you remember?

625
00:57:25,650 --> 00:57:27,277
You told me that Wo Ai Ni

626
00:57:27,360 --> 00:57:29,904
meant "come find me"
and that's why I wrote that.

627
00:57:30,447 --> 00:57:34,033
In huge letters.
So you would come find me.

628
00:57:37,912 --> 00:57:38,997
Oh, really?

629
00:57:40,457 --> 00:57:44,002
You're not just making things up, are you?

630
00:57:45,545 --> 00:57:49,507
So I'm here because of you?

631
00:57:50,425 --> 00:57:51,426
Yes.

632
00:57:55,763 --> 00:57:57,557
You sure have a way with words.

633
00:58:08,693 --> 00:58:10,028
What's going on? What's that?

634
00:58:10,111 --> 00:58:11,863
Look at those moves.

635
00:58:11,946 --> 00:58:14,032
Why would you take this and put it up?

636
00:58:14,449 --> 00:58:16,993
-I'm so sorry, Yuko.
-It's okay.

637
00:58:17,076 --> 00:58:19,787
Right, you think your wife will mind?

638
00:58:19,871 --> 00:58:21,206
-What do you think?
-Guess not.

639
00:58:21,289 --> 00:58:23,166
Are you crazy? Oh, my God!

640
00:58:23,249 --> 00:58:24,876
Wait! What's up with her?

641
00:58:24,959 --> 00:58:26,044
Take it down now.

642
00:58:26,127 --> 00:58:27,921
Did you not tell her you were married?

643
00:58:41,100 --> 00:58:44,020
Honey. You home? It's me.

644
00:58:49,442 --> 00:58:52,111
Are we having a memorial ceremony?

645
00:58:53,154 --> 00:58:54,989
For who?

646
00:58:58,159 --> 00:59:00,036
Go ahead, make a toast.

647
00:59:01,704 --> 00:59:02,747
Okay.

648
00:59:12,006 --> 00:59:14,008
Who could this be for?

649
00:59:26,646 --> 00:59:29,023
No, Stop! Shit.

650
00:59:34,779 --> 00:59:35,989
Who is this for?

651
00:59:37,198 --> 00:59:38,199
It's for you.

652
00:59:44,622 --> 00:59:46,791
First rule, never say you're sorry.

653
00:59:47,667 --> 00:59:50,169
The rule of thumb in taming your wife.

654
00:59:50,253 --> 00:59:53,715
When you say those words,
she'll ask, "Why are you sorry?"

655
00:59:53,798 --> 00:59:56,342
And you're done. It'll never end.

656
00:59:56,426 --> 01:00:00,722
Take the words "I'm sorry"
out of your vocabulary. Erase them.

657
01:00:00,930 --> 01:00:02,098
Erase them.

658
01:00:02,181 --> 01:00:04,100
Just walk in yelling
and asserting your manhood.

659
01:00:04,183 --> 01:00:05,727
-Ma'am!
-Yes?

660
01:00:05,810 --> 01:00:07,186
Hello.

661
01:00:07,270 --> 01:00:09,188
I'm Yong-sub. How're you?

662
01:00:09,272 --> 01:00:10,231
Come on in.

663
01:00:12,650 --> 01:00:13,651
We meet again.

664
01:00:13,985 --> 01:00:15,987
What do you mean, "again"?

665
01:00:16,070 --> 01:00:17,947
We sure did meet last time.

666
01:00:18,031 --> 01:00:19,866
What?

667
01:00:19,949 --> 01:00:22,619
Well, I want to say a proper hello.
I'm Choi Yong-sub.

668
01:00:22,702 --> 01:00:24,162
And you are beautiful.

669
01:00:24,954 --> 01:00:27,957
Let's see how good you are in the kitchen.

670
01:00:28,041 --> 01:00:30,001
I'll be the judge of that.

671
01:00:50,021 --> 01:00:51,064
You, too?

672
01:01:10,958 --> 01:01:13,753
It's hot in here.

673
01:01:13,836 --> 01:01:17,715
Take my socks off.
Why don't you wash my feet?

674
01:01:33,481 --> 01:01:35,483
Hey, come on, he's watching.

675
01:01:35,566 --> 01:01:38,361
Not here, come on.

676
01:01:39,195 --> 01:01:42,031
Not here, we have company.

677
01:01:42,281 --> 01:01:44,158
Yong-sub is here.

678
01:01:44,575 --> 01:01:45,535
Look…

679
01:01:47,620 --> 01:01:50,164
You're going to sponge me clean?

680
01:01:50,957 --> 01:01:54,043
But Yong-sub's here.

681
01:01:54,127 --> 01:01:55,712
What chemistry.

682
01:01:56,796 --> 01:01:58,047
A happily married couple.

683
01:01:58,131 --> 01:02:00,133
Maybe not the front.

684
01:02:00,883 --> 01:02:02,969
You're so bold, honey.

685
01:02:03,052 --> 01:02:05,138
We should keep this private between us.

686
01:02:05,221 --> 01:02:07,140
The booze is tasting fine.

687
01:02:10,601 --> 01:02:13,813
Did you know they call this flogging?

688
01:02:16,315 --> 01:02:17,316
Ma'am!

689
01:02:22,989 --> 01:02:25,032
-Honey!
-I thought you were hot?

690
01:02:25,116 --> 01:02:28,870
Yong-sub, wait. Yong-sub!

691
01:02:28,953 --> 01:02:31,122
You cool now? You cooling off?

692
01:02:31,205 --> 01:02:33,416
Yong-sub! Yong-sub!

693
01:02:33,499 --> 01:02:36,169
Honey, it was all his idea. Yong-sub!

694
01:02:38,087 --> 01:02:39,088
Honey!

695
01:02:40,965 --> 01:02:44,177
I'm sorry. I'll never do it again.

696
01:02:56,189 --> 01:02:58,149
-Yong-sub?
-Yes, ma'am.

697
01:02:59,150 --> 01:03:02,069
It's not much but please help yourself.

698
01:03:02,153 --> 01:03:03,112
Thank you, ma'am.

699
01:03:06,866 --> 01:03:08,576
This is for Yong-sub.

700
01:03:09,160 --> 01:03:11,245
This is for you.

701
01:03:15,166 --> 01:03:16,709
Go ahead.

702
01:03:26,177 --> 01:03:29,597
No, not this.
We need hangover soup.

703
01:03:30,181 --> 01:03:31,140
Hangover soup?

704
01:03:31,224 --> 01:03:35,102
Yeah, something that hits the spot.
Soupy and hot.

705
01:03:35,186 --> 01:03:39,148
Just eat it.
She worked hard to cook for us.

706
01:03:39,232 --> 01:03:44,153
Okay, just a minute.
I'll make you some hangover soup.

707
01:03:44,237 --> 01:03:46,197
See, I told you she'd do it.

708
01:03:55,164 --> 01:03:58,209
What's this? This is soju!

709
01:04:04,340 --> 01:04:10,179
The cure for a hangover is more alcohol.
Here, take a shot.

710
01:04:10,263 --> 01:04:14,892
I even made you hangover soup
after a late drunken night.

711
01:04:16,894 --> 01:04:18,646
Aren't you impressed?

712
01:04:19,981 --> 01:04:20,982
Drink it.

713
01:04:37,248 --> 01:04:42,295
Kyun-woo. What do you want for lunch?

714
01:04:43,212 --> 01:04:44,213
Let's get spicy noodles.

715
01:04:44,297 --> 01:04:48,217
Spicy noodles? There's a fabulous place
on Mara Island. Wanna go?

716
01:04:49,343 --> 01:04:52,388
You think we can make it back in time?

717
01:04:53,306 --> 01:04:55,308
Mr. Kim is asking for you.

718
01:04:58,978 --> 01:05:01,272
You have any idea
why you're called the Oxford team?

719
01:05:03,274 --> 01:05:05,109
Still not a clue.

720
01:05:06,277 --> 01:05:09,155
Let me tell you the reason behind
such an auspicious name.

721
01:05:09,530 --> 01:05:10,948
Last year, we were pressured

722
01:05:11,073 --> 01:05:13,534
by the government
to hire local college graduates.

723
01:05:13,618 --> 01:05:18,122
So, reluctantly, we put out an ad.

724
01:05:18,664 --> 01:05:21,208
Do you know how many applications we got?
Fifty thousand.

725
01:05:21,292 --> 01:05:24,128
Who has the time to review all of them?
We were beside ourselves.

726
01:05:24,211 --> 01:05:27,256
But our chairman had a brilliant idea.

727
01:05:27,340 --> 01:05:28,841
Let's have Oxford choose.

728
01:05:28,925 --> 01:05:32,386
You know who Oxford is?
He is the chairman's dog.

729
01:05:32,470 --> 01:05:34,138
INTERVIEWER OXFORD
I WILL PICK

730
01:05:34,221 --> 01:05:36,307
Pick the right ones, okay?

731
01:05:42,021 --> 01:05:48,110
We can't have our employees waste precious
company time on this. It's wasteful.

732
01:05:48,194 --> 01:05:49,362
You're absolutely right!

733
01:05:50,279 --> 01:05:52,365
Now I propose a toast!

734
01:05:53,282 --> 01:05:56,827
Why do you think you're constantly
made to write apology letters?

735
01:05:58,496 --> 01:06:02,708
Bring me the restructuring plan.
And where's my frigging coffee? Coffee!

736
01:06:05,378 --> 01:06:07,171
Hurry. Get in here. Hurry!

737
01:06:07,254 --> 01:06:08,339
I'm sorry, sir.

738
01:06:14,845 --> 01:06:17,139
This is an organizational
restructuring proposal.

739
01:06:17,223 --> 01:06:18,641
Why don't you take a look?

740
01:06:29,402 --> 01:06:33,030
Congratulations on being picked by a dog.

741
01:06:33,114 --> 01:06:36,117
-Congrats!
-Congrats to you, too.

742
01:06:36,200 --> 01:06:37,785
Chosen by a dog.

743
01:06:56,303 --> 01:06:59,807
Did you know about this, Yuko?

744
01:07:00,850 --> 01:07:05,021
I know we don't have much to offer
but this is not right.

745
01:07:09,358 --> 01:07:14,697
We must have been the butt
of all jokes. Such losers.

746
01:07:16,449 --> 01:07:17,533
That's not true.

747
01:07:17,616 --> 01:07:21,328
But this type of hiring practice
is so demeaning.

748
01:07:23,414 --> 01:07:25,416
It's awful.

749
01:07:26,500 --> 01:07:31,630
Are you thinking of resigning?

750
01:07:32,965 --> 01:07:33,966
No.

751
01:07:35,968 --> 01:07:40,389
I'm going to do my best to stay put.

752
01:07:41,223 --> 01:07:43,309
I got in by the skin of my teeth

753
01:07:43,893 --> 01:07:50,483
and I can't disappoint my wife like that.

754
01:07:52,359 --> 01:07:54,612
Cheer up, Kyun-woo.

755
01:07:57,406 --> 01:08:00,326
Yes, I will.

756
01:08:12,463 --> 01:08:14,715
Happy birthday, honey.

757
01:08:14,799 --> 01:08:16,675
Come on, let's blow out the candles.

758
01:08:21,430 --> 01:08:23,432
A wish, make a wish.

759
01:08:26,477 --> 01:08:29,855
Whether I run with the dogs
or cattle out in the world,

760
01:08:29,939 --> 01:08:33,526
I want to be
the best husband ever for her.

761
01:08:38,489 --> 01:08:39,740
Here, this is for you.

762
01:08:41,492 --> 01:08:42,535
Okay.

763
01:08:48,999 --> 01:08:53,546
Cheer up, Kyun-woo. For your wife, too.

764
01:08:53,629 --> 01:08:55,965
-I will be cheering you on from the sides.
-Okay.

765
01:09:07,601 --> 01:09:12,106
One, two, three,

766
01:09:12,648 --> 01:09:16,652
four, five, six…

767
01:09:20,447 --> 01:09:23,450
Why is that Oxford dude always
hovering around Yuko?

768
01:09:23,534 --> 01:09:26,745
-It's getting on my nerves.
-Leave him be. His days are numbered.

769
01:09:26,829 --> 01:09:29,957
He and Yong-sub
are hanging by a thread.

770
01:09:30,541 --> 01:09:34,545
How much longer will those two
picked by a dog be hanging around her?

771
01:09:37,506 --> 01:09:42,428
Here, take this home. This, too.
Take that Oxford sign off.

772
01:09:42,511 --> 01:09:44,013
This is my desk.

773
01:09:44,346 --> 01:09:48,642
This area was never yours.
Finally, the office is back to normal.

774
01:09:49,643 --> 01:09:50,686
Kyun-woo.

775
01:09:54,106 --> 01:09:58,736
Yong-sub, you're being sent
to the satellite office on Mara Island.

776
01:09:59,612 --> 01:10:04,450
And Kyun-woo, how about
being my personal driver?

777
01:10:05,618 --> 01:10:09,622
Think about it and decide.
You can always resign.

778
01:10:11,123 --> 01:10:13,083
So cool.

779
01:10:14,126 --> 01:10:19,673
This is so romantic.
So what's the occasion?

780
01:10:26,680 --> 01:10:30,684
I got transferred today. A better team.

781
01:10:33,646 --> 01:10:37,483
Really? Congratulations.

782
01:10:38,609 --> 01:10:43,697
It's good, huh?
Things are going to go well for us.

783
01:10:46,325 --> 01:10:48,244
I like things the way they are.

784
01:10:50,955 --> 01:10:52,581
What about Yong-sub?

785
01:10:52,665 --> 01:10:54,708
Is he going with you?

786
01:10:57,628 --> 01:11:02,716
Yong-sub? Yes, he did too.

787
01:11:05,386 --> 01:11:06,679
That's great.

788
01:11:08,639 --> 01:11:13,227
Yes, honey, I have a substitute driver
and am on my way home.

789
01:11:13,310 --> 01:11:17,147
What about the kids? Okay, honey.

790
01:11:19,733 --> 01:11:23,737
Drop me off at home.
There's some ball game tomorrow.

791
01:11:24,571 --> 01:11:26,573
Go stand in line tonight
and buy the tickets.

792
01:11:26,657 --> 01:11:27,741
Yes, sir.

793
01:11:41,338 --> 01:11:45,676
Dad, Mom. Are you watching over us?

794
01:11:49,221 --> 01:11:50,806
What should I do?

795
01:11:54,310 --> 01:11:57,104
Should I keep waiting for

796
01:11:58,689 --> 01:12:02,735
Kyun-woo to find his way?

797
01:12:15,247 --> 01:12:17,416
A dog picks the humans!

798
01:12:17,499 --> 01:12:22,129
I'm Yong-sub and this is unbelievable!
MTJ, you must respond!

799
01:12:22,212 --> 01:12:25,507
I came to this company
ready to give my life

800
01:12:25,591 --> 01:12:29,970
to make the best company in the world.

801
01:12:30,054 --> 01:12:32,848
How old is Oxford?

802
01:12:33,807 --> 01:12:35,768
How old? Why would…

803
01:12:38,896 --> 01:12:42,691
Yong-sub. What's this? Are we on TV?

804
01:12:43,817 --> 01:12:45,903
Hello, everyone.

805
01:12:47,321 --> 01:12:48,489
Hey.

806
01:12:48,989 --> 01:12:50,366
LET'S FIGHT

807
01:12:50,449 --> 01:12:52,368
Here, have some. I made it.

808
01:13:03,379 --> 01:13:04,380
There.

809
01:13:11,595 --> 01:13:16,183
It's not soju this time. It's warm.

810
01:13:20,854 --> 01:13:22,648
There's plenty.

811
01:13:33,200 --> 01:13:34,201
Darn.

812
01:13:37,871 --> 01:13:39,832
Aren't you finished with my homework?

813
01:13:39,915 --> 01:13:42,251
Might as well do it myself.

814
01:13:42,793 --> 01:13:45,421
-Yes, hurry up.
-Hurry up.

815
01:13:45,754 --> 01:13:46,839
Hey.

816
01:13:48,590 --> 01:13:49,800
Yes, Mr. Kim.

817
01:13:50,592 --> 01:13:53,720
Yes, I'm at
your children's soccer practice.

818
01:13:54,930 --> 01:13:57,975
Right now? Okay.

819
01:13:58,767 --> 01:13:59,768
You do it yourselves.

820
01:13:59,852 --> 01:14:01,478
No. Why?

821
01:14:01,562 --> 01:14:06,817
Can't believe these ingrates.
Giving interviews and doing a media play.

822
01:14:06,900 --> 01:14:08,068
One sec.

823
01:14:10,863 --> 01:14:13,866
You want to send out this release?
Nicely written.

824
01:14:13,949 --> 01:14:18,579
This should shut those Oxford losers
on unlawful dismissal.

825
01:14:20,914 --> 01:14:23,792
Yong-sub. Really?

826
01:14:23,876 --> 01:14:27,796
He sounds like a real scumbag.
Sexually harassing our female staff.

827
01:14:27,921 --> 01:14:30,591
Yong-sub didn't do anything like that.

828
01:14:30,674 --> 01:14:32,926
What? I see, you're friends.

829
01:14:33,010 --> 01:14:36,722
I thought you were out of that Oxford rut.

830
01:14:36,805 --> 01:14:39,850
Look, I want you to send out
the release to all the media outlets.

831
01:14:39,933 --> 01:14:44,605
You can always resign if you're not
up for it. Quit and go join your friends.

832
01:15:07,586 --> 01:15:08,587
Honey.

833
01:15:10,339 --> 01:15:12,216
Don't you have something to tell me?

834
01:15:13,884 --> 01:15:16,970
Something? Not really.

835
01:15:18,931 --> 01:15:23,018
Tell me what's on your mind.
I'm a really good listener.

836
01:15:24,895 --> 01:15:25,938
I really don't.

837
01:15:30,025 --> 01:15:31,985
Honey, you remember that time…

838
01:15:34,029 --> 01:15:36,990
when your mother hugged me?

839
01:15:38,951 --> 01:15:41,078
I really loved that.

840
01:15:41,912 --> 01:15:46,208
She embraced me
as if to say she accepted me.

841
01:15:47,876 --> 01:15:48,961
I felt it then.

842
01:15:49,044 --> 01:15:55,008
That being a family is about
embracing one another and accepting them.

843
01:16:09,231 --> 01:16:10,232
Yes, sir.

844
01:16:13,360 --> 01:16:14,444
Friday evening?

845
01:16:14,987 --> 01:16:16,947
Yes, yes, sir.

846
01:16:17,614 --> 01:16:18,657
No, it's fine, sir.

847
01:16:18,740 --> 01:16:19,825
I'm accusing Yong-sub of the Oxford team

848
01:16:19,908 --> 01:16:21,118
Yes, yes, sir.

849
01:16:31,795 --> 01:16:32,921
Cheers.

850
01:16:38,343 --> 01:16:40,304
-Mr. Kim!
-Mr. Kim!

851
01:16:44,850 --> 01:16:46,226
Mr. Kim!

852
01:16:46,310 --> 01:16:48,395
Yong-sub is here.

853
01:16:48,478 --> 01:16:50,188
-Mr. Kim!
-Mr. Kim!

854
01:16:54,526 --> 01:16:55,986
What are you doing here?

855
01:16:56,069 --> 01:16:57,946
How dare you show up here of all places?

856
01:16:58,030 --> 01:16:59,615
Please. Hear us out.

857
01:16:59,698 --> 01:17:01,992
-What are we covering?
-Mr. Kim!

858
01:17:02,075 --> 01:17:03,285
Take your hands off them.

859
01:17:05,120 --> 01:17:06,121
Kyun-woo.

860
01:17:07,080 --> 01:17:10,083
Yong-sub. How'd you know we were here?

861
01:17:10,667 --> 01:17:11,793
I told him.

862
01:17:12,461 --> 01:17:13,295
What?

863
01:17:14,004 --> 01:17:17,633
I told him to talk to Mr. Kim directly.
No one is listening to him.

864
01:17:17,716 --> 01:17:20,719
Are you crazy?
This is not your concern.

865
01:17:20,802 --> 01:17:22,012
Mr. Kim.

866
01:17:23,055 --> 01:17:23,930
Where are you going?

867
01:17:24,014 --> 01:17:26,391
Hey, stop.

868
01:17:27,059 --> 01:17:28,727
Please give us one more chance.

869
01:17:28,810 --> 01:17:31,021
Apologize to Yong-sub.

870
01:17:31,146 --> 01:17:33,940
Are you nuts?
You're out of your mind. Get out.

871
01:17:34,024 --> 01:17:36,485
Guards! Don't just stand there.
Throw her out.

872
01:17:42,074 --> 01:17:43,909
What are you doing? No, I just…

873
01:17:43,992 --> 01:17:45,202
Honey, honey.

874
01:17:45,285 --> 01:17:48,080
-Move away!
-Honey!

875
01:17:48,163 --> 01:17:49,373
Why are you doing this?

876
01:18:11,144 --> 01:18:12,145
Sir!

877
01:18:17,150 --> 01:18:18,694
Water, water!

878
01:18:36,086 --> 01:18:38,088
Sir, sir!

879
01:18:40,006 --> 01:18:42,092
Sir, are you all right?

880
01:18:44,970 --> 01:18:47,013
-Move.
-Cover him.

881
01:18:47,097 --> 01:18:49,307
-Let me cover him.
-It's freezing.

882
01:18:50,267 --> 01:18:52,060
I almost died.

883
01:18:52,144 --> 01:18:53,186
Ma'am, are you okay?

884
01:18:53,270 --> 01:18:57,190
You! How dare you barge
in here and ruin everything?

885
01:18:57,274 --> 01:18:59,651
Calm down, Kyun-woo.

886
01:19:00,193 --> 01:19:02,529
What do you want from me?

887
01:19:04,281 --> 01:19:06,074
Why didn't you tell me?

888
01:19:07,117 --> 01:19:09,035
Yong-sub was already fired.

889
01:19:09,119 --> 01:19:11,913
No matter how much we try,
I won't get another job.

890
01:19:11,997 --> 01:19:16,001
Not that. Why didn't you tell me
from the beginning?

891
01:19:16,251 --> 01:19:19,254
What? About Oxford?

892
01:19:20,255 --> 01:19:24,176
That I got hired by a dog?

893
01:19:24,342 --> 01:19:27,888
I got the job of my dreams
because of a mutt.

894
01:19:27,971 --> 01:19:30,640
There, you happy now?
Are you satisfied now?

895
01:19:32,267 --> 01:19:36,104
I won't let you work at a company
that treats you this badly.

896
01:19:36,188 --> 01:19:40,150
Why not? It's because
that's what it takes.

897
01:19:40,233 --> 01:19:42,569
Everyone takes it and lives on.

898
01:19:42,652 --> 01:19:45,530
You don't need this job.
We can do better.

899
01:19:45,947 --> 01:19:50,243
How do we live?
This is why I didn't tell you.

900
01:19:50,327 --> 01:19:53,830
Because you would react like this
and ruin everything like a little child.

901
01:19:53,914 --> 01:19:57,542
See? Now look what you've done.

902
01:19:59,294 --> 01:20:05,425
I know you're just saying things
but you don't mean them.

903
01:20:06,051 --> 01:20:09,846
Just saying things?
This is the truth.

904
01:20:10,931 --> 01:20:16,937
Grinning like an idiot and saying yes
to everything, that's not the truth.

905
01:20:18,939 --> 01:20:20,357
I waited for you.

906
01:20:23,068 --> 01:20:26,112
I waited for you to tell me the truth.

907
01:20:26,196 --> 01:20:28,532
Then you should have kept
waiting 'til the end.

908
01:20:29,199 --> 01:20:32,619
You didn't trust me, that's all.

909
01:20:35,872 --> 01:20:39,292
No, that's not true.
That's not true, honey.

910
01:20:42,963 --> 01:20:44,339
I'm so tired.

911
01:20:45,841 --> 01:20:51,346
Making you laugh
has now become burdensome.

912
01:20:54,391 --> 01:20:57,853
Kyun-woo. Kyun-woo. Kyun-woo!

913
01:20:58,728 --> 01:21:00,063
Wait!

914
01:21:06,236 --> 01:21:07,237
One,

915
01:21:08,280 --> 01:21:09,281
two,

916
01:21:10,699 --> 01:21:11,700
three,

917
01:21:12,367 --> 01:21:13,743
four,

918
01:21:15,161 --> 01:21:16,371
five,

919
01:21:17,330 --> 01:21:18,498
six,

920
01:21:19,541 --> 01:21:20,542
seven,

921
01:21:23,753 --> 01:21:24,838
eight,

922
01:21:27,799 --> 01:21:29,175
nine,

923
01:21:29,467 --> 01:21:31,177
Kyun-woo…

924
01:21:31,261 --> 01:21:32,721
Nine…

925
01:21:36,266 --> 01:21:37,309
Nine…

926
01:22:44,542 --> 01:22:51,508
I think I held onto you too tightly
and made things hard for you.

927
01:22:52,467 --> 01:22:56,513
I'm going to let go of you now
so you can be free.

928
01:23:08,441 --> 01:23:10,402
Are you really okay?

929
01:23:12,529 --> 01:23:14,864
-Yes.
-I was really worried about you.

930
01:23:16,491 --> 01:23:18,326
Let me know if I missed anything.

931
01:23:19,452 --> 01:23:20,495
No, that's okay.

932
01:23:23,164 --> 01:23:24,165
Thank you.

933
01:23:28,044 --> 01:23:33,299
Your wife, she seems like a great person.

934
01:23:37,387 --> 01:23:39,222
He may be a nobody to others,

935
01:23:39,305 --> 01:23:42,475
but he is the most precious one
and the only person in my heart.

936
01:23:43,435 --> 01:23:45,562
Please don't hurt him anymore.

937
01:23:47,480 --> 01:23:48,940
Please.

938
01:23:50,275 --> 01:23:51,568
What's she jabbering about?

939
01:23:51,651 --> 01:23:53,069
Idiot.

940
01:23:57,490 --> 01:23:59,492
Good bye, Kyun-woo.

941
01:23:59,576 --> 01:24:01,411
Be happy.

942
01:24:02,537 --> 01:24:03,621
Thank you.

943
01:24:53,880 --> 01:24:56,633
Now, those are our stars.

944
01:25:38,341 --> 01:25:41,511
I'll make you smile everyday.

945
01:26:22,552 --> 01:26:24,721
Goose, goose, goose

946
01:26:25,638 --> 01:26:28,725
Your bent neck
Points to the skies as you sing

947
01:26:29,684 --> 01:26:32,937
White feathers floating on the blue waters

948
01:26:34,439 --> 01:26:38,109
Your red soles touched by the blue sea

949
01:26:48,411 --> 01:26:50,997
I'm playing in the ocean.

950
01:26:51,080 --> 01:26:52,832
Swimming in a small sea.

951
01:27:27,784 --> 01:27:33,665
I'll go there first.
You come find me. Promise?

952
01:27:34,791 --> 01:27:37,627
How will I get there?

953
01:27:40,713 --> 01:27:43,716
Pee Wee, I will never forget you.

954
01:27:44,425 --> 01:27:46,970
You're my bridegroom.

955
01:28:05,655 --> 01:28:06,739
Wo Ai Ni.

956
01:28:07,782 --> 01:28:10,785
It means you promise to come find me.

957
01:28:11,869 --> 01:28:16,791
Okay. I'll find you. Wo Ai Ni.

958
01:28:45,486 --> 01:28:50,491
I walk the paths
that I walked once with her.

959
01:28:51,868 --> 01:28:55,580
It's hard and scary but I'm okay.

960
01:28:57,457 --> 01:29:04,422
She had to walk these paths to find me.

961
01:29:07,967 --> 01:29:11,888
These letters. Do you know this village?

962
01:31:40,036 --> 01:31:41,120
I'm sorry.

963
01:31:42,747 --> 01:31:45,333
I was always afraid you'd leave.

964
01:31:46,626 --> 01:31:50,004
That you'd stop needing me.

965
01:31:52,048 --> 01:31:56,052
Even when you're the one
that came to find me.

966
01:31:57,094 --> 01:31:59,138
I haven't done anything for you.

967
01:32:01,057 --> 01:32:04,644
Thank you and I'm sorry.

968
01:32:07,021 --> 01:32:09,023
But I won't let you go again.

969
01:32:10,566 --> 01:32:12,109
No matter how far you go.

970
01:32:13,027 --> 01:32:18,324
Even if I disappoint you and you leave me.

971
01:32:18,991 --> 01:32:24,080
I'll go to the end of the world
to find you.

972
01:32:27,124 --> 01:32:30,920
I told you before. Wo Ai Ni.

973
01:32:45,101 --> 01:32:50,982
You've always been there for me

974
01:32:51,065 --> 01:32:52,984
and you took my hand.

975
01:32:54,068 --> 01:32:55,444
That's everything.

976
01:33:00,199 --> 01:33:05,246
You're the star
that my mom and dad sent to me.

977
01:33:05,871 --> 01:33:08,624
My precious star.

978
01:33:11,127 --> 01:33:14,297
You're perfect the way you are.

979
01:33:15,715 --> 01:33:17,341
You are just perfect.

980
01:33:19,135 --> 01:33:25,099
Thank you so much for finding me.

981
01:33:34,191 --> 01:33:36,444
Because next time, you're dead meat.

982
01:33:38,070 --> 01:33:39,989
Okay, okay, of course.

983
01:33:40,072 --> 01:33:44,327
I haven't finished counting to ten yet.

984
01:33:46,120 --> 01:33:47,163
You're lucky.

985
01:34:14,231 --> 01:34:18,152
Who knows? I may lose my way again.

986
01:34:18,235 --> 01:34:19,320
BEAUTIFUL STAR

987
01:34:19,403 --> 01:34:22,823
I may step onto a path
not shown on the map

988
01:34:22,907 --> 01:34:28,746
or run into a desert,
or if I'm lucky, an oasis.

989
01:34:28,829 --> 01:34:30,081
ANGEL MOM, PEE WEE DAD

990
01:34:30,164 --> 01:34:32,375
But it doesn't matter.

991
01:34:32,458 --> 01:34:37,171
Because I'm with them, my own stars
and nothing matters.

992
01:34:38,631 --> 01:34:41,092
Even if we're lost in the desert,

993
01:34:41,175 --> 01:34:44,136
the sun will shine on us
and the stars will light our way.

994
01:34:44,929 --> 01:34:47,390
As long as the stars shine in our hearts,

995
01:34:47,473 --> 01:34:54,397
we will stay on the path
and stand up to find the way.

996
01:35:08,244 --> 01:35:09,662
Daddy. It's for you.

997
01:35:10,162 --> 01:35:13,249
It's some lady who says
she's come down from the mountains.

998
01:35:13,332 --> 01:35:14,333
What?

999
01:35:14,417 --> 01:35:16,293
What? Lady?
