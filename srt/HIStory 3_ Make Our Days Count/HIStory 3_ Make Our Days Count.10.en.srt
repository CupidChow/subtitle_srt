[HIStory 3: Make Our Days Count]
[Episode 10]

14
00:01:46,200 --> 00:01:47,100
What is it?

15
00:01:47,101 --> 00:01:50,100
Did you get in touch with the professors?

16
00:01:50,100 --> 00:01:51,599
Just about.

17
00:01:51,600 --> 00:01:54,299
When are you planning to book the tickets?

18
00:01:54,300 --> 00:01:57,099
- Mid-July.
- Jul... Mid-July?

19
00:01:57,100 --> 00:01:59,299
This quick?

20
00:01:59,300 --> 00:02:03,399
I want to get there earlier to get used to the environment. That would be more ideal.

21
00:02:03,400 --> 00:02:05,900
Then, I'll have to let dad know. He's been asking.

22
00:02:05,900 --> 00:02:08,300
He's asked me quite a few times already.

23
00:02:10,700 --> 00:02:12,199
Right, did you tell me that

24
00:02:12,200 --> 00:02:15,499
tomorrow or the day after, you need to go to the airport and pick someone up?

25
00:02:15,500 --> 00:02:16,799
He hasn't bought a ticket yet.

26
00:02:16,800 --> 00:02:18,299
I'm also waiting for him to let me know.

27
00:02:18,300 --> 00:02:20,299
Then, where are you going to stay when you get back?

28
00:02:20,300 --> 00:02:23,499
Should I prepare your room for you guys?

29
00:02:23,500 --> 00:02:25,599
Or give you guys the master bedroom?

30
00:02:25,600 --> 00:02:27,299
It's okay.

31
00:02:27,300 --> 00:02:29,399
I won't give up my rental so soon.

32
00:02:29,400 --> 00:02:32,080
Besides, there's still a lot of things to take care of.

33
00:02:33,100 --> 00:02:35,699
I'm also planning to take him for an island tour around Taiwan.

34
00:02:35,700 --> 00:02:39,599
Since, after we leave this time, it'll be a while before we come back.

35
00:02:39,600 --> 00:02:42,699
You should take him for a tour around the island.

36
00:02:42,700 --> 00:02:44,799
Although he went two years before you,

37
00:02:44,800 --> 00:02:47,900
this time, he helped you get into a U.S. graduate school.

38
00:02:47,900 --> 00:02:49,699
And then to take care of all the school matters,

39
00:02:49,700 --> 00:02:53,599
it's good to thank him. It's a must.

40
00:02:53,600 --> 00:02:55,700
I will.

41
00:02:55,700 --> 00:02:57,400
Wait a bit.

42
00:02:59,600 --> 00:03:01,700
Smells good.

43
00:03:02,900 --> 00:03:07,699
I don't know when Xiang Haoting will be able to drink this again.

44
00:03:07,699 --> 00:03:10,900
Mom's home-cooked pineapple bitter melon chicken soup.

45
00:03:11,800 --> 00:03:14,300
I'm so reluctant to see you go.

46
00:03:37,440 --> 00:03:39,330
Hey!

47
00:03:41,550 --> 00:03:43,360
Hey!

48
00:03:48,400 --> 00:03:50,200
Why so suddenly?

49
00:04:03,500 --> 00:04:06,300
Uncle, you should change the decor a bit.

50
00:04:06,300 --> 00:04:08,200
It's been so long.

51
00:04:09,600 --> 00:04:10,900
Here.

52
00:04:15,900 --> 00:04:19,200
This really means something to me.

53
00:04:19,200 --> 00:04:21,299
Oh yeah.

54
00:04:21,300 --> 00:04:23,600
Try our store's new drink.

55
00:04:28,700 --> 00:04:30,300
It's not bad.

56
00:04:31,300 --> 00:04:33,399
Your business is really big now.

57
00:04:33,400 --> 00:04:35,099
Franchises all over Taiwan.

58
00:04:35,100 --> 00:04:37,300
Not really. It's just a few friends who wanted to invest.

59
00:04:37,300 --> 00:04:38,799
Invest?

60
00:04:38,800 --> 00:04:40,399
Then, do you want to invest in my movie?

61
00:04:40,400 --> 00:04:42,799
Movie?

62
00:04:42,800 --> 00:04:45,699
Movies, I don't think I can.

63
00:04:45,700 --> 00:04:47,999
How about you be our cover page?

64
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:50,299
Cover page?

65
00:04:50,300 --> 00:04:51,599
Sure.

66
00:04:51,600 --> 00:04:52,699
Then, how much are you going to pay me?

67
00:04:52,700 --> 00:04:53,700
You little rascal!

68
00:04:53,701 --> 00:04:55,499
I'm your uncle!

69
00:04:55,500 --> 00:04:56,500
Uncle?

70
00:04:56,501 --> 00:04:59,799
Then I'll give you a 10% discount.

71
00:05:03,800 --> 00:05:07,099
Tell me. What's up?

72
00:05:13,900 --> 00:05:16,199
Grandpa wanted me to give these to you.

73
00:05:16,200 --> 00:05:18,300
He said he didn't need them.

74
00:05:21,200 --> 00:05:23,300
Grandpa's still the same.

75
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:25,600
Yeah.

76
00:05:26,700 --> 00:05:28,799
I really admire the two of you.

77
00:05:28,800 --> 00:05:31,299
Persisting for so long without giving in.

78
00:05:31,300 --> 00:05:33,899
Who said? I gave up very early on.

79
00:05:33,900 --> 00:05:36,300
This is a gift from Boxiang.

80
00:05:37,200 --> 00:05:38,499
No wonder!

81
00:05:38,500 --> 00:05:41,499
I was about to say, every time you see this, you have a frown on your face.

82
00:05:41,500 --> 00:05:42,999
This time, you smiled.

83
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:46,400
I'm just smiling through my frown, okay?

84
00:05:49,400 --> 00:05:50,499
Finally, we got everyone together.

85
00:05:50,500 --> 00:05:52,299
How long has it been since we saw each other?

86
00:05:52,300 --> 00:05:54,399
I really missed all of you.

87
00:05:54,400 --> 00:05:55,499
What have you been up to lately?

88
00:05:55,500 --> 00:05:58,099
Lately? I've been busy working with a lot of different websites.

89
00:05:58,099 --> 00:06:00,201
That's great! You should ask me to help out.

90
00:06:00,201 --> 00:06:04,199
Let me tell you! I've really elevated my shooting skills.

91
00:06:04,200 --> 00:06:06,499
You should ask him to shoot for you.

92
00:06:06,500 --> 00:06:08,500
How about next time we do it together?

93
00:06:08,500 --> 00:06:09,600
Are you being serious?

94
00:06:09,601 --> 00:06:11,200
I'm serious.

95
00:06:12,300 --> 00:06:14,099
Let's take a picture.

96
00:06:14,100 --> 00:06:15,799
It's been too long since we've seen each other. Let's take a picture.

97
00:06:15,800 --> 00:06:17,099
Wait for Sun Bo.

98
00:06:17,100 --> 00:06:19,700
He's late, forget him!

99
00:06:20,600 --> 00:06:22,600
- Miss me?
- You're late! How dare you?

100
00:06:22,600 --> 00:06:24,099
It's been so long and you're still late.

101
00:06:24,100 --> 00:06:25,499
I am? Am I late?

102
00:06:25,500 --> 00:06:26,699
- I'm here just on time.
- How dare you?

103
00:06:26,700 --> 00:06:27,899
You know what being late means, don't you?

104
00:06:27,900 --> 00:06:29,700
- What?
- Three shots!

105
00:06:29,700 --> 00:06:31,799
I can't, I drove today.

106
00:06:31,800 --> 00:06:33,399
- Stop kidding around.
- You're using the driving excuse.

107
00:06:33,400 --> 00:06:34,699
I'm telling you guys!

108
00:06:34,700 --> 00:06:35,700
Soda!

109
00:06:35,701 --> 00:06:37,699
Boss, give me a big bottle of soda!

110
00:06:37,700 --> 00:06:38,600
Boring.

111
00:06:38,601 --> 00:06:39,699
No excuses now with soda.

112
00:06:39,700 --> 00:06:40,500
No excuses.

113
00:06:40,501 --> 00:06:42,199
Thanks.

114
00:06:42,200 --> 00:06:45,900
- What were you talking about just now?
- Old Sun! Just for you.

115
00:06:45,900 --> 00:06:48,100
- That's too much.
- Here. Let me in.

116
00:06:48,100 --> 00:06:49,100
You can't hide now.

117
00:06:49,100 --> 00:06:50,000
Drink up!

118
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:50,900
Drink!

119
00:06:50,901 --> 00:06:51,999
Okay, I'll drink.

120
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:53,699
Bottoms up!

121
00:06:53,700 --> 00:06:57,100
- Okay. That's too much!
- This is just soda.

122
00:06:57,100 --> 00:06:59,500
- Drink.
- Drink.

123
00:07:00,600 --> 00:07:02,200
- Wait!
- What?

124
00:07:02,200 --> 00:07:04,199
Why did we get together this time?

125
00:07:04,200 --> 00:07:05,599
Because of you.

126
00:07:05,600 --> 00:07:07,899
You should drink, too.

127
00:07:07,900 --> 00:07:09,499
Don't change the subject!

128
00:07:09,500 --> 00:07:10,500
You drink first,

129
00:07:10,501 --> 00:07:12,200
Bottoms up!

130
00:07:14,400 --> 00:07:15,899
Drink up!

131
00:07:15,900 --> 00:07:18,599
Give me a break, it's only soda.

132
00:07:18,600 --> 00:07:20,199
Try coming late again.

133
00:07:20,200 --> 00:07:22,200
- It's been so long since we've got together.
- I'll never be late again, okay?

134
00:07:22,200 --> 00:07:23,200
Really.

135
00:07:23,200 --> 00:07:24,100
Here, let me pour you another cup.

136
00:07:24,101 --> 00:07:25,699
Just one more. Stop kidding around!

137
00:07:25,700 --> 00:07:27,499
We agreed on three!

138
00:07:27,500 --> 00:07:29,099
What?

139
00:07:29,100 --> 00:07:31,299
- Drink.
- That's enough.

140
00:07:31,300 --> 00:07:32,799
How about adding mentos to it?

141
00:07:32,800 --> 00:07:34,199
Stop fooling around!

142
00:07:34,200 --> 00:07:35,399
Stop feeding them lousy ideas!

143
00:07:35,400 --> 00:07:36,400
I'll go buy some!

144
00:07:36,400 --> 00:07:37,501
Bro, sit down.

145
00:07:37,501 --> 00:07:38,799
Sorry, my bad.

146
00:07:38,800 --> 00:07:40,099
Stop fooling around, okay?

147
00:07:40,100 --> 00:07:41,701
- I'm scared.
- Wait!

148
00:07:41,701 --> 00:07:43,999
Mentos only works in cola,

149
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:45,700
not with Sprite

150
00:07:47,100 --> 00:07:48,799
Physics major!

151
00:07:48,800 --> 00:07:51,100
Not the same.

152
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:53,499
But since you were able to graduate,

153
00:07:53,500 --> 00:07:54,999
you're pretty amazing.

154
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:58,200
Speaking of which. You've been quite disrespectful.

155
00:07:58,200 --> 00:07:59,599
It's been so long!

156
00:07:59,600 --> 00:08:02,199
That's true. It's your turn to drink.

157
00:08:02,199 --> 00:08:03,300
I just graduated last week.

158
00:08:03,300 --> 00:08:04,499
It's been quite a few days now.

159
00:08:04,500 --> 00:08:06,099
I've been organizing my grad study papers

160
00:08:06,100 --> 00:08:07,800
and recommendations along with other stuff.

161
00:08:07,800 --> 00:08:09,899
I'm getting ready to go to Stanford.

162
00:08:09,900 --> 00:08:11,899
Stanford!

163
00:08:11,900 --> 00:08:13,299
The haircut place?

164
00:08:13,300 --> 00:08:15,799
Right, the one on Chunghsiao East Road.

165
00:08:15,800 --> 00:08:19,100
It has the best physics faculty in the U.S.

166
00:08:20,400 --> 00:08:23,199
- The world's different now.
- True.

167
00:08:23,200 --> 00:08:24,599
A-hao, not only did you graduate,

168
00:08:24,600 --> 00:08:26,699
you're also the crème of the crop.

169
00:08:26,700 --> 00:08:28,199
Crème of the crop.

170
00:08:28,200 --> 00:08:29,999
Best of the best is truly different.

171
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:33,200
- Universal genius.
- Universal genius.

172
00:08:33,200 --> 00:08:36,099
- What do you mean?
- Universal genius?

173
00:08:36,099 --> 00:08:37,599
Gao Chun is speaking proverbs!

174
00:08:37,600 --> 00:08:39,700
Old Sun, give it here.

175
00:08:41,200 --> 00:08:42,899
I graduated from university, too. You know?

176
00:08:42,900 --> 00:08:45,699
And have had two years of experience in the work field.

177
00:08:45,700 --> 00:08:48,599
What have you been doing these past two years?

178
00:08:48,600 --> 00:08:50,400
You have balls asking me this.

179
00:08:52,100 --> 00:08:53,100
Fashion management.

180
00:08:53,100 --> 00:08:54,000
Right.

181
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:56,300
- That's my brother. He understands me.
- That goes without saying.

182
00:08:56,301 --> 00:08:57,599
Fooling around like me.

183
00:08:57,600 --> 00:08:59,599
Who's fooling around like you?

184
00:08:59,600 --> 00:09:00,600
Different indeed.

185
00:09:00,601 --> 00:09:03,279
Some people really work, you're unemployed.

186
00:09:03,280 --> 00:09:04,699
What are you talking about?

187
00:09:04,700 --> 00:09:06,099
I have to explain this, let me tell you.

188
00:09:06,100 --> 00:09:09,100
I've been really studying up on photography.

189
00:09:09,100 --> 00:09:11,499
Dreams have to be built one step at a time.

190
00:09:11,500 --> 00:09:12,500
That's great!

191
00:09:12,501 --> 00:09:15,199
Have you taken that step yet?

192
00:09:15,200 --> 00:09:17,099
What do you mean?

193
00:09:17,100 --> 00:09:17,900
Drink!

194
00:09:17,901 --> 00:09:19,300
What should we drink to?

195
00:09:20,400 --> 00:09:21,600
Making a fortune!

196
00:09:21,600 --> 00:09:23,499
To Lamborghini.

197
00:09:23,500 --> 00:09:25,999
- To friendship.
- Friendship!

198
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:27,700
Bottoms up!

199
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:34,399
Coach, give us some pointers.

200
00:09:34,400 --> 00:09:35,799
Sure, you the one that doesn't want to train.

201
00:09:35,800 --> 00:09:38,300
- What the hell are you doing?
- So strong!

202
00:09:38,300 --> 00:09:40,100
- I can do it, too.
- Get out of here, you're out!

203
00:09:40,100 --> 00:09:41,099
I can, too!

204
00:09:41,100 --> 00:09:42,100
You're so tiny!

205
00:09:42,101 --> 00:09:44,100
It's okay, you know how to take photos.

206
00:09:45,800 --> 00:09:47,400
When is your son coming back?

207
00:09:47,400 --> 00:09:49,399
I've finished cooking the last dish already.

208
00:09:49,400 --> 00:09:51,900
Should be... He's home now.

209
00:09:51,900 --> 00:09:53,900
How come you're home so late?

210
00:09:53,900 --> 00:09:57,300
After I finished dinner with Sun Bo and the guys, Professor Chen asked me to help out.

211
00:09:57,300 --> 00:09:58,999
That professor of yours really can't bear to let you go.

212
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:01,899
Your brother is now a top student. Unlike you.

213
00:10:01,899 --> 00:10:03,100
I just hope you can graduate university.

214
00:10:03,100 --> 00:10:04,899
Okay, okay, Dad. Let's just eat.

215
00:10:04,900 --> 00:10:07,099
I'll graduate university for sure, okay?

216
00:10:07,100 --> 00:10:09,099
That's right! It'll be no problem.

217
00:10:09,100 --> 00:10:10,199
Do you have a boyfriend?

218
00:10:10,200 --> 00:10:11,999
Why have you been dressing up lately?

219
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:13,599
I have not.

220
00:10:13,600 --> 00:10:15,299
- No?
- Listen to your brother.

221
00:10:15,300 --> 00:10:16,899
Your attire is too revealing.

222
00:10:16,900 --> 00:10:20,100
Is it? I bought them, they're fine.

223
00:10:20,100 --> 00:10:21,399
Let me put away my bag first.

224
00:10:21,400 --> 00:10:23,800
Remember to wash your hands.

225
00:10:23,800 --> 00:10:27,400
Dad, when I was young and dressed like that, you said I looked beautiful.

226
00:10:27,400 --> 00:10:31,400
Not the same. A daughter needs to look like a daughter.

227
00:10:31,400 --> 00:10:33,600
Then listen to your father.

228
00:12:05,200 --> 00:12:07,599
Wasn't he just putting away his bag and washing his hands? Why is he taking so long?

229
00:12:07,599 --> 00:12:09,900
Xiang Haoting, come out.

230
00:12:16,800 --> 00:12:18,250
Son.

231
00:12:20,600 --> 00:12:22,400
Come eat.

232
00:12:25,700 --> 00:12:26,999
It's your first time going abroad,

233
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:29,999
if there are things that you can't bring with you this time,

234
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:31,499
just put them all together.

235
00:12:31,500 --> 00:12:33,600
Mom will mail them to you.

236
00:12:34,500 --> 00:12:35,899
Hurry, come out and eat.

237
00:12:35,900 --> 00:12:37,899
The dishes are getting cold.

238
00:12:37,900 --> 00:12:39,400
Okay.

239
00:12:54,200 --> 00:12:55,800
Son.

240
00:13:07,500 --> 00:13:12,099
These past few years you've been so busy every day.

241
00:13:12,100 --> 00:13:15,699
Like a spinning top, spinning round and round. Never stopping.

242
00:13:17,900 --> 00:13:20,799
I know that you think maybe it's better this way.

243
00:13:20,800 --> 00:13:22,260
But...

244
00:13:23,700 --> 00:13:26,500
it's time you should slow down a bit.

245
00:13:26,500 --> 00:13:29,800
Let yourself live again.

246
00:13:31,900 --> 00:13:35,500
Or else, you will...

247
00:13:35,500 --> 00:13:39,100
you will miss a lot of what's going on in your life.

248
00:13:41,500 --> 00:13:43,050
Besides...

249
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:47,700
Besides, you're surrounded by many people that love you.

250
00:14:48,800 --> 00:14:50,800
Baby, I'm home.

251
00:14:56,800 --> 00:14:59,400
Looks delicious!

252
00:15:28,600 --> 00:15:31,100
What's wrong? What are you upset about?

253
00:15:31,100 --> 00:15:34,799
- Is there something you're not telling me?
- Huh?

254
00:15:34,800 --> 00:15:36,500
No.

255
00:15:42,800 --> 00:15:44,800
It got returned again?

256
00:15:45,800 --> 00:15:47,899
I thought that since it was your dad's birthday,

257
00:15:47,900 --> 00:15:49,800
we should do something for him.

258
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:54,700
Didn't we agree to not send any more presents?

259
00:15:54,700 --> 00:15:58,200
Don't forget. Every year we go to give him a present, we get kicked out.

260
00:15:58,200 --> 00:16:01,300
But it seems like it's getting better, year after year.

261
00:16:01,300 --> 00:16:03,000
Do you remember the first time we went?

262
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:06,299
Your dad took out the butcher knife and chased us out.

263
00:16:06,300 --> 00:16:08,300
This year, at least we stepped into the house.

264
00:16:08,300 --> 00:16:09,999
Yes, we did step in.

265
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:12,099
But then we got kicked out immediately.

266
00:16:12,100 --> 00:16:15,199
Besides, it made everyone in the family quite awkward.

267
00:16:15,200 --> 00:16:18,299
But this year's awkwardness was

268
00:16:18,300 --> 00:16:19,999
a little less than before, that's an improvement.

269
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:22,200
I doubt it.

270
00:16:23,700 --> 00:16:26,599
I think your dad snuck a smile this year.

271
00:16:26,600 --> 00:16:28,199
Smile?

272
00:16:28,200 --> 00:16:31,000
I think you've been designing too much. So much that your eyes can't focus.

273
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:34,699
Probably. But that's also what keeps me going.

274
00:16:34,699 --> 00:16:37,399
We can only hope to get a chance by continuing to do it, right?

275
00:16:39,100 --> 00:16:40,699
I know.

276
00:16:40,700 --> 00:16:42,699
I know you're doing this for my benefit,

277
00:16:42,700 --> 00:16:45,500
but this is not our responsibility.

278
00:16:46,700 --> 00:16:48,800
It makes me feel bad.

279
00:16:49,700 --> 00:16:51,899
We're so happy now.

280
00:16:51,900 --> 00:16:55,599
Letting your dad bother us once in a while is not bad either.

281
00:16:56,900 --> 00:17:00,000
Forget it. I can't talk you out of it.

282
00:17:03,200 --> 00:17:05,500
Then, do it my way.

283
00:17:08,600 --> 00:17:11,999
Not only can you cook, you really are good with a knife.

284
00:17:13,400 --> 00:17:15,800
Your punishment tonight is you can only eat one bowl for dinner.

285
00:18:44,700 --> 00:18:47,799
Senior, you're late again.

286
00:18:47,799 --> 00:18:48,700
I'm sorry.

287
00:18:48,701 --> 00:18:50,800
Seriously.

288
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:53,799
Senior, hurry and eat.

289
00:18:53,800 --> 00:18:56,699
I'm telling you! The chicken wings at this place are super good.

290
00:18:56,700 --> 00:18:58,900
Or do you want to have caramel pudding?

291
00:19:00,900 --> 00:19:03,199
What do you want to drink? I'll go and order it for you.

292
00:19:03,200 --> 00:19:04,630
- Anything is fine.
- Anything?

293
00:19:06,700 --> 00:19:10,600
I'm going to have another store favorite: berry soda.

294
00:19:11,400 --> 00:19:13,499
Senior, we all thought that you would pick

295
00:19:13,500 --> 00:19:16,799
one of the European schools from England or Germany.

296
00:19:16,800 --> 00:19:18,899
I never thought you'd choose the U.S. in the end.

297
00:19:18,900 --> 00:19:21,399
But the States is pretty cool, too.

298
00:19:21,399 --> 00:19:25,800
We all really envy you. I also really want to go.

299
00:19:29,600 --> 00:19:33,300
Oh right! Last time, when we went hiking the Northern Chatien Mountain with EI and Chinhao,

300
00:19:33,300 --> 00:19:35,799
I heard them say that your girlfriend is coming back.

301
00:19:35,800 --> 00:19:39,399
You really are something. You told them before me.

302
00:19:39,400 --> 00:19:41,399
We've known each other for much longer.

303
00:19:41,400 --> 00:19:42,999
Tell me! What do you mean by this?

304
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:46,299
It's nothing. I just mentioned it to them.

305
00:19:48,100 --> 00:19:50,000
How did you two meet?

306
00:19:51,900 --> 00:19:53,499
She was my senior sister.

307
00:19:53,500 --> 00:19:56,100
We got together just before she graduated.

308
00:19:56,100 --> 00:19:58,999
That's so good.

309
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:00,399
I'm not as lucky as you.

310
00:20:00,400 --> 00:20:01,699
I really want one, too.

311
00:20:01,700 --> 00:20:04,299
I don't know any good looking senior sisters.

312
00:20:04,300 --> 00:20:05,999
Excuse me, your berry soda.

313
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:07,400
Thank you.

314
00:20:15,500 --> 00:20:18,400
What? Do I have something on my face?

315
00:20:24,800 --> 00:20:26,599
Take a look at this.

316
00:20:26,600 --> 00:20:28,400
What is it?

317
00:20:28,400 --> 00:20:29,599
My equipment.

318
00:20:29,600 --> 00:20:30,600
Equipment?

319
00:20:30,601 --> 00:20:32,100
Why do I need to look at it?

320
00:20:32,100 --> 00:20:34,500
See what you want and let me know.

321
00:20:35,700 --> 00:20:37,600
Are you serious?

322
00:20:39,200 --> 00:20:41,900
Senior, you have so much equipment.

323
00:20:43,600 --> 00:20:45,699
You're not going to hike after you go abroad?

324
00:20:45,700 --> 00:20:48,300
If I need anything, I'll just buy it there.

325
00:20:48,300 --> 00:20:49,399
I knew it!

326
00:20:49,400 --> 00:20:51,699
You like the stars so much, you're like an astronaut.

327
00:20:51,700 --> 00:20:54,299
How can you just say you're going to quit?

328
00:20:54,300 --> 00:20:57,199
Then I'm not going to pick.

329
00:20:57,200 --> 00:20:59,100
I'll take it all!

330
00:21:00,500 --> 00:21:03,199
That's great. It's all mine.

331
00:21:03,199 --> 00:21:05,300
This is so great!

332
00:21:06,200 --> 00:21:08,299
I'll find a time to pick them up from you.

333
00:21:08,300 --> 00:21:09,799
Sure.

334
00:21:09,800 --> 00:21:13,000
If you don't have time to meet, I'll mail them to you.

335
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:15,499
Before you leave, we should get together again.

336
00:21:15,500 --> 00:21:18,599
Besides, you've given me so much equipment, I need to treat you to a big meal.

337
00:21:18,599 --> 00:21:22,699
Under NT$150, I'll buy.

338
00:21:28,900 --> 00:21:34,199
Do you know? That day when the apple was going to compete with the pear.

339
00:21:34,199 --> 00:21:37,599
Whoever said their own name first would lose.

340
00:21:37,599 --> 00:21:40,800
The pear said, "Come on."

341
00:21:42,199 --> 00:21:44,000
Then the pear lost.

342
00:21:46,400 --> 00:21:48,400
What?

343
00:21:51,700 --> 00:21:53,599
- It's a joke.
- Joke?

344
00:21:53,600 --> 00:21:55,499
What's the joke?

345
00:21:55,500 --> 00:21:59,599
Senior, that's not funny at all.

346
00:21:59,599 --> 00:22:01,999
I'm telling you, I really can't laugh at all.

347
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:04,800
You really need to work harder.

348
00:22:20,800 --> 00:22:22,400
Bye-bye.

349
00:22:22,410 --> 00:22:24,000
Huh?

350
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:26,600
This isn't another one of your jokes, is it?

351
00:22:27,800 --> 00:22:31,100
This time, I'm really going to say goodbye to you.

352
00:22:31,100 --> 00:22:33,700
How come you're saying it like we're never going to see each other again?

353
00:22:33,700 --> 00:22:37,299
I'm telling you. There are a lot of mountains that everyone's not climbed yet.

354
00:22:37,300 --> 00:22:39,500
You can't just leave like this.

355
00:22:43,100 --> 00:22:45,200
That's too much!

356
00:22:46,400 --> 00:22:49,600
Like this every time. Leaves whenever he wants.

357
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:53,800
Someone's treating.

358
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:05,399
I'm not a kid.

359
00:23:05,400 --> 00:23:07,699
Don't keep patting my head.

360
00:23:07,700 --> 00:23:08,999
Fine.

361
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:11,200
Who did you meet up with today?

362
00:23:12,500 --> 00:23:14,500
Someone I met hiking.

363
00:23:15,800 --> 00:23:17,999
Thanks for coming with me shopping.

364
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:20,000
Of course, I'm going to help you.

365
00:23:23,500 --> 00:23:25,900
- Looks like it's going to rain soon. Let's go.
- Let's go.

366
00:23:36,900 --> 00:23:38,699
Miss. Miss!

367
00:23:38,700 --> 00:23:39,899
Sorry, excuse me.

368
00:23:39,900 --> 00:23:41,699
Do you have this in another color?

369
00:23:41,700 --> 00:23:44,599
- Yes, it comes in blue and yellow.
- Where is it?

370
00:23:44,599 --> 00:23:45,799
Over there, the rack over there!

371
00:23:45,800 --> 00:23:47,400
Okay.

372
00:24:01,800 --> 00:24:06,400
Brother, I remembered Sister Phoebe likes to wear earth tones, doesn't she?

373
00:24:06,400 --> 00:24:07,800
Yes.

374
00:24:09,400 --> 00:24:11,700
Then take a look at this one.

375
00:24:13,300 --> 00:24:14,800
It's okay.

376
00:24:16,100 --> 00:24:18,499
Is it the end of the world if you don't look at your phone?

377
00:24:18,500 --> 00:24:21,600
Playing with it even when you're shopping.

378
00:24:21,600 --> 00:24:23,800
I trust your judgment.

379
00:24:25,900 --> 00:24:28,320
Then how about this one. Is this one more suitable for her?

380
00:24:37,200 --> 00:24:39,199
From the time we came in until now,

381
00:24:39,200 --> 00:24:42,200
that store clerk over there has been starring at you.

382
00:24:49,200 --> 00:24:51,299
Xiang Haoting.

383
00:24:51,300 --> 00:24:52,800
Li Shiyu.

384
00:25:00,700 --> 00:25:03,599
I never thought I'd bump into you there.

385
00:25:03,600 --> 00:25:06,600
That's all girls stuff over there.

386
00:25:06,600 --> 00:25:08,400
It really is a coincidence.

387
00:25:09,500 --> 00:25:11,799
Being able to get together with old friends

388
00:25:11,800 --> 00:25:13,599
before going abroad is pretty nice.

389
00:25:13,600 --> 00:25:15,300
Thanks to your sister.

390
00:25:18,500 --> 00:25:20,099
Are your glasses real or fake?

391
00:25:20,100 --> 00:25:22,099
They're real!

392
00:25:22,100 --> 00:25:24,899
When did you start to wear glasses?

393
00:25:24,900 --> 00:25:28,000
Even wearing a necklace, looking very artsy.

394
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:30,599
You really have changed a lot.

395
00:25:30,600 --> 00:25:31,999
You haven't changed much.

396
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:34,799
Of course, I'm Li Shiyu.

397
00:25:34,800 --> 00:25:37,999
I keep telling my boyfriend I look the same as when I was in high school.

398
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:39,470
Do you think so?

399
00:25:53,100 --> 00:25:55,299
Besides appearance,

400
00:25:55,300 --> 00:26:00,100
you seem to have become much more mature.

401
00:26:02,100 --> 00:26:05,400
Where did that monkey crab from high school go?

402
00:26:06,500 --> 00:26:08,500
I really never thought

403
00:26:10,100 --> 00:26:12,500
people could change.

404
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:25,499
How about you? How are things going?

405
00:26:25,499 --> 00:26:27,399
Pretty good.

406
00:26:27,400 --> 00:26:29,299
After graduating I thought getting a job would be easy.

407
00:26:29,300 --> 00:26:32,900
But it seemed harder than I thought.

408
00:26:32,900 --> 00:26:36,099
So I interviewed for this job first.

409
00:26:36,100 --> 00:26:38,100
I thought I'd just try it out.

410
00:26:40,100 --> 00:26:43,799
But I never thought that your sister would like our clothing.

411
00:26:43,800 --> 00:26:45,799
Tell her to look for me next time.

412
00:26:45,800 --> 00:26:47,599
I can give her our employee discount.

413
00:26:47,600 --> 00:26:49,600
Okay. Thank you.

414
00:26:49,600 --> 00:26:51,360
You're welcome.

415
00:26:53,400 --> 00:26:55,699
How about you? Where are you working?

416
00:26:55,700 --> 00:26:57,799
I just graduated from university.

417
00:26:57,800 --> 00:26:59,920
You delayed graduating from National Central University?

418
00:27:00,900 --> 00:27:02,899
After graduating, I retook the exams for two years

419
00:27:02,900 --> 00:27:05,699
before getting into the physics department at National Taiwan University.

420
00:27:05,700 --> 00:27:07,450
NTU physics?

421
00:27:08,300 --> 00:27:10,499
Are you serious? That's so hard to get into!

422
00:27:10,500 --> 00:27:13,599
You retook your exams and got into NTU Physics?

423
00:27:13,600 --> 00:27:16,700
Back then, didn't our school only have Yu Shi...

424
00:27:40,100 --> 00:27:43,100
That accident was all too sudden.

425
00:27:45,300 --> 00:27:49,100
I heard from Meifang that he didn't have any parents,

426
00:27:49,100 --> 00:27:53,599
so his aunt took care of the funeral.

427
00:27:55,100 --> 00:27:59,199
His aunt wanted it to be very simple and very low profile.

428
00:27:59,200 --> 00:28:02,710
No one knew the time or the place of the funeral.

429
00:28:03,500 --> 00:28:06,999
So I wasn't able to go and see Yu Shigu one last time.

430
00:28:13,200 --> 00:28:15,699
If I didn't see you today,

431
00:28:15,700 --> 00:28:18,300
I probably wouldn't have thought about him.

432
00:28:20,400 --> 00:28:22,899
Knowing that you are doing very well right now,

433
00:28:22,900 --> 00:28:24,900
I'm very happy for you.

434
00:28:30,500 --> 00:28:32,200
Thank you.

435
00:30:15,100 --> 00:30:17,100
You're Yu Shigu?

436
00:30:33,900 --> 00:30:35,900
I really like you!

437
00:31:08,100 --> 00:31:13,390
♫ Hey, lean on my back ♫

438
00:31:13,390 --> 00:31:17,020
♫ Let yourself have a good cry ♫

439
00:31:18,390 --> 00:31:23,930
♫ I will face you with my back and not disrupt your tears ♫

440
00:31:23,930 --> 00:31:27,670
♫ Let yourself be fragile for once ♫

441
00:31:27,670 --> 00:31:32,470
♫ I will be like this in front of you ♫

442
00:31:32,470 --> 00:31:38,170
♫ At the time that you need it, gently say ‘Hey’ ♫

443
00:32:11,630 --> 00:32:16,500
♫ Hey, lean on my back ♫

444
00:32:16,500 --> 00:32:21,730
I love you.

445
00:32:21,800 --> 00:32:26,900
♫ I will face you with my back and not disrupt your tears ♫

446
00:32:26,900 --> 00:32:31,100
♫ Let yourself be fragile for once ♫

447
00:32:31,100 --> 00:32:35,900
♫ I will be like this in front of you ♫

448
00:32:35,980 --> 00:32:42,000
♫ At the time that you need it, gently say ‘Hey’ ♫

449
00:32:45,730 --> 00:32:48,870
♫ gently say ‘Hey’ ♫

450
00:32:59,130 --> 00:33:02,630
♫ Hey, whispering in my ear ♫

451
00:33:02,630 --> 00:33:06,450
♫ Giving the warmest comfort ♫

452
00:33:07,600 --> 00:33:13,600
♫ And then staying by your side listening to your tears ♫

453
00:33:13,600 --> 00:33:17,200
♫ To let pain hurt again ♫

454
00:33:17,200 --> 00:33:21,800
♫ And to understand pain again ♫

455
00:33:21,800 --> 00:33:29,940
♫ To encounter pain again, I can still gently say ‘Hey’ ♫

456
00:33:57,100 --> 00:33:59,799
Showered and changed.

457
00:33:59,800 --> 00:34:01,599
Don't worry.

458
00:34:01,600 --> 00:34:03,400
Bye-bye.

459
00:34:16,300 --> 00:34:18,100
Everyone's looking for you.

460
00:34:18,100 --> 00:34:20,600
Do you know that you let everyone worry about you?

461
00:34:24,700 --> 00:34:26,900
What are you thinking?

462
00:34:28,800 --> 00:34:30,710
I've changed.

463
00:34:32,200 --> 00:34:34,399
We've all changed.

464
00:34:34,400 --> 00:34:36,300
But he hasn't changed.

465
00:35:00,740 --> 00:35:05,260
His time stopped when he was eighteen.

466
00:35:08,600 --> 00:35:10,900
But mine will continue to move on.

467
00:35:10,900 --> 00:35:12,900
Unable to stop.

468
00:35:20,900 --> 00:35:23,400
I keep longing to be able to close the distance between us.

469
00:35:23,400 --> 00:35:24,899
So I keep climbing mountains,

470
00:35:24,900 --> 00:35:28,099
and continue to climb mountains that are even closer to the stars.

471
00:35:28,100 --> 00:35:30,699
It's like I can touch the stars when I reach out my hand,

472
00:35:30,700 --> 00:35:33,300
like being able to touch...

473
00:35:47,800 --> 00:35:49,400
That's enough.

474
00:35:58,600 --> 00:36:00,400
But it's wrong.

475
00:36:02,300 --> 00:36:05,699
No matter how much I want to get closer to him,

476
00:36:05,700 --> 00:36:09,000
reality is that our distance

477
00:36:10,200 --> 00:36:12,299
will become further and further apart.

478
00:36:12,300 --> 00:36:14,500
He's still eighteen.

479
00:36:16,300 --> 00:36:17,800
Only I've changed.

480
00:36:21,100 --> 00:36:23,100
I'm so scared.

481
00:36:25,100 --> 00:36:27,300
I'm very frightened.

482
00:36:44,000 --> 00:36:46,999
But for him at eighteen,

483
00:36:47,000 --> 00:36:49,500
will always have you at eighteen beside him.

484
00:36:56,300 --> 00:36:58,100
I still...

485
00:36:59,300 --> 00:37:03,100
I still often dream about that intersection.

486
00:37:05,800 --> 00:37:07,800
That car.

487
00:37:11,800 --> 00:37:13,630
Him lying there.

488
00:37:14,400 --> 00:37:16,000
But I couldn't do anything.

489
00:37:16,000 --> 00:37:18,000
I didn't do anything.

490
00:37:23,100 --> 00:37:24,900
That's enough!

491
00:37:25,600 --> 00:37:28,140
He left so little behind.

492
00:37:28,800 --> 00:37:30,499
But do you know?

493
00:37:30,500 --> 00:37:33,300
You know that every one is a picture.

494
00:37:33,300 --> 00:37:35,500
Every one is a memory.

495
00:37:38,000 --> 00:37:41,099
All of those things have left me so full...

496
00:37:41,100 --> 00:37:43,700
so full that I'm ready to explode.

497
00:37:52,100 --> 00:37:53,700
Sun Bo,

498
00:37:56,300 --> 00:37:58,300
do you know?

499
00:38:00,200 --> 00:38:03,100
I tried to forget him.

500
00:38:15,100 --> 00:38:17,300
I couldn't.

501
00:38:22,400 --> 00:38:25,400
The only thing I managed to do was to keep remembering him.

502
00:38:26,200 --> 00:38:28,700
Carry him with me as I lived.

503
00:38:33,200 --> 00:38:36,000
But it really hurts.

504
00:38:38,300 --> 00:38:40,800
I really miss him.

505
00:38:46,800 --> 00:38:49,000
I miss him so much my heart hurts.

506
00:38:55,000 --> 00:38:58,199
If I keep on like this, I won't be able to handle it.

507
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:02,300
You don't need to forget him.

508
00:39:04,300 --> 00:39:06,599
You only need to keep moving forward.

509
00:39:06,600 --> 00:39:09,000
You've carried him this far.

510
00:39:09,000 --> 00:39:11,599
If you can't find your direction,

511
00:39:11,600 --> 00:39:14,430
you just keep going in the direction you're heading.

512
00:39:15,300 --> 00:39:17,300
You will find the exit.

513
00:39:47,200 --> 00:39:49,900
I really don't know how to continue on my own.

514
00:39:53,300 --> 00:39:55,300
You still have all of us.

515
00:40:01,500 --> 00:40:03,800
You were never alone.

516
00:40:13,100 --> 00:40:14,999
It's okay.

517
00:40:15,000 --> 00:40:16,800
It's all right.

518
00:40:40,100 --> 00:40:42,499
It smells so good.

519
00:40:42,500 --> 00:40:45,799
Dad, you're getting so much better.

520
00:40:45,800 --> 00:40:50,300
I never knew you had this hidden talent.

521
00:40:50,300 --> 00:40:52,400
- Here.
- It's just--

522
00:40:53,500 --> 00:40:55,199
This plating is so amazing!

523
00:40:55,200 --> 00:40:57,899
Like the restaurants that serve brunch.

524
00:40:57,900 --> 00:41:00,199
Like Mei & Mei.

525
00:41:00,200 --> 00:41:03,199
Then, we'll call ourselves Beautiful Mother Xiang's.
(Mei means beautiful)

526
00:41:03,200 --> 00:41:05,000
I'm just talking to myself.

527
00:41:06,600 --> 00:41:09,200
Oh no! Xiang Haoting!

528
00:41:10,200 --> 00:41:12,300
Xiang Haoting, get up. Stop sleeping!

529
00:41:12,300 --> 00:41:13,899
Didn't you ask me to wake you?

530
00:41:13,900 --> 00:41:15,299
It's after ten!

531
00:41:15,300 --> 00:41:17,599
Don't you have an appointment with someone?

532
00:41:17,600 --> 00:41:18,799
He came back so late last night.

533
00:41:18,800 --> 00:41:20,899
He's rarely home, let him sleep some more.

534
00:41:20,900 --> 00:41:22,999
I also want him to sleep more.

535
00:41:23,000 --> 00:41:25,499
But yesterday, he didn't answer his professor's calls.

536
00:41:25,500 --> 00:41:27,900
This morning, he's already called twice and asked him to return his calls.

537
00:41:27,900 --> 00:41:30,000
- Sister, come eat.
- Come, Sister.

538
00:41:30,000 --> 00:41:31,899
- Coming.
- Xiang Haoting, get up!

539
00:41:31,900 --> 00:41:33,599
Stop sleeping in!

540
00:41:33,600 --> 00:41:36,599
Sister, you're beautiful enough. Hurry up.

541
00:41:38,900 --> 00:41:40,499
Xiang Haoting!

542
00:41:40,500 --> 00:41:42,299
I'm up.

543
00:41:42,300 --> 00:41:43,500
- Come.
- Good morning.

544
00:41:43,500 --> 00:41:45,100
Morning.

545
00:41:47,700 --> 00:41:50,899
- My head hurts.
- Headache?

546
00:41:50,900 --> 00:41:53,399
Sister, go get an aspirin for him.

547
00:41:53,400 --> 00:41:55,199
He's probably hung over.

548
00:41:55,200 --> 00:41:57,599
Last night, when he came home, he smelled like alcohol.

549
00:41:57,600 --> 00:41:59,799
Right, it must be a hangover.

550
00:41:59,800 --> 00:42:02,799
Then go down to the convenience store and buy some hangover remedy.

551
00:42:02,800 --> 00:42:04,999
Okay.

552
00:42:05,000 --> 00:42:09,000
Dad, nowadays you really favor him.

553
00:42:09,800 --> 00:42:13,400
That's enough. Your brother's about to go abroad and he won't be home for much longer.

554
00:42:13,400 --> 00:42:15,399
Siblings shouldn't be so fussy. Hurry up and go.

555
00:42:15,401 --> 00:42:17,140
Hurry up.

556
00:42:19,900 --> 00:42:23,800
Haoting, I'm telling you, Phaebe is a nice girl.

557
00:42:23,800 --> 00:42:26,700
- Dad, "Phoebe."
- Phoebe.

558
00:42:26,700 --> 00:42:29,799
Right, you have to remember. Don't forget when they come over and you say it wrong.

559
00:42:29,799 --> 00:42:32,099
- Phoebe.
- That would be awkward.

560
00:42:32,100 --> 00:42:33,899
Phoebe is a nice girl.

561
00:42:33,900 --> 00:42:36,399
This time when you go abroad with her, see if you are used to being with her.

562
00:42:36,399 --> 00:42:38,900
If the feeling is mutual, you might as well settle down.

563
00:42:38,900 --> 00:42:41,000
Such a nice girl like that. If you don't take the opportunity,

564
00:42:41,000 --> 00:42:42,599
others will steal her away.

565
00:42:42,600 --> 00:42:45,300
Really. What dad's saying is right.

566
00:42:45,300 --> 00:42:47,199
Good girls are hard to find.

567
00:42:47,200 --> 00:42:51,599
Besides the two of you have so much in common and have so much to talk about, right?

568
00:42:51,600 --> 00:42:55,499
But if you have other plans, you have to tell the other person as soon as possible.

569
00:42:55,500 --> 00:42:57,900
Don't waste the other person's time.

570
00:43:00,600 --> 00:43:02,400
I'm going to shower first.

571
00:43:05,800 --> 00:43:07,799
Then come eat after you shower.

572
00:43:07,800 --> 00:43:09,800
Dad made it.

573
00:43:12,400 --> 00:43:15,299
He... never responded.

574
00:43:15,299 --> 00:43:16,999
Right, not yet.

575
00:43:17,000 --> 00:43:18,599
We'll continue to ask him after he has showered.

576
00:43:18,600 --> 00:43:21,099
It's okay. It'll be fine.

577
00:43:21,100 --> 00:43:22,700
Dad, are you cooking something?

578
00:43:22,701 --> 00:43:24,299
It smells like it's burning.

579
00:43:24,300 --> 00:43:26,000
My hot dogs!

580
00:43:26,500 --> 00:43:29,700
There's no way you can be the boss like this.

581
00:43:38,100 --> 00:43:39,299
Uncle, you're back.

582
00:43:39,300 --> 00:43:41,099
Why are you here all of a sudden?

583
00:43:41,100 --> 00:43:43,700
I have something that I need your help with.

584
00:43:43,700 --> 00:43:45,100
[Welcome home]

585
00:43:45,100 --> 00:43:46,599
What have you been up to lately?

586
00:43:46,600 --> 00:43:47,999
I just finished shooting a film.

587
00:43:48,000 --> 00:43:50,101
- I'm telling you, I'm exhausted.
- Thank you.

588
00:43:50,101 --> 00:43:51,299
That's so cool.

589
00:43:51,300 --> 00:43:52,899
It's so hard to imagine your lifestyle.

590
00:43:52,900 --> 00:43:55,600
No need to imagine. It's not humanly possible.

591
00:43:56,800 --> 00:44:00,599
Busy man, why did you have time to drop by today?

592
00:44:06,300 --> 00:44:07,700
Fine.

593
00:44:09,400 --> 00:44:13,200
I've been thinking about how to apologize to the two of you.

594
00:44:13,200 --> 00:44:15,700
For my past misunderstanding.

595
00:44:18,100 --> 00:44:19,900
Why do you need to apologize?

596
00:44:22,000 --> 00:44:23,200
I misunderstood.

597
00:44:23,200 --> 00:44:25,200
What do you mean?

598
00:44:27,400 --> 00:44:30,000
Whatever's on your mind, just say it. It's okay.

599
00:44:31,400 --> 00:44:33,599
It's that health food.

600
00:44:33,600 --> 00:44:35,399
Grandpa wanted me to return it to you.

601
00:44:35,400 --> 00:44:37,299
I thought that was it,

602
00:44:37,300 --> 00:44:40,099
but he had another message.

603
00:44:40,100 --> 00:44:41,800
What message?

604
00:44:49,400 --> 00:44:52,800
Grandpa wishes that the two of you will not give him any more presents.

605
00:44:52,800 --> 00:44:54,699
If Grandpa doesn't like those presents,

606
00:44:54,700 --> 00:44:56,299
we can gift him something else.

607
00:44:56,300 --> 00:44:58,799
It's not about what the present is.

608
00:44:58,800 --> 00:45:02,100
Even if you get him even more presents, Grandpa will still not be able to understand.

609
00:45:02,900 --> 00:45:04,299
What he wants to say is...

610
00:45:04,300 --> 00:45:05,699
Wait!

611
00:45:05,700 --> 00:45:09,400
If it's the same negative stuff, you don't need to say it.

612
00:45:09,400 --> 00:45:11,600
We'll use our imagination.

613
00:45:20,500 --> 00:45:23,300
What he wants to say to you two is...

614
00:45:26,700 --> 00:45:28,300
Uncle,

615
00:45:29,500 --> 00:45:31,700
you can come home.

616
00:45:34,900 --> 00:45:37,699
You said... Chigang can go home?

617
00:45:37,699 --> 00:45:40,700
Grandpa gave you permission, too.

618
00:45:40,700 --> 00:45:41,999
Me!

619
00:45:42,000 --> 00:45:44,000
I can go, too!

620
00:45:52,900 --> 00:45:55,799
Were you being serious just now?

621
00:45:55,800 --> 00:45:57,499
Everyone's waiting for the two of you to go home.

622
00:45:57,500 --> 00:46:00,399
Let me go check on him. You just sit tight.

623
00:46:15,100 --> 00:46:16,899
Don't cry.

624
00:46:16,900 --> 00:46:19,500
Isn't this something to be happy about?

625
00:46:30,600 --> 00:46:32,800
Tomorrow, we'll go home together.

626
00:47:41,500 --> 00:47:47,800
♫ The correct feeling is waiting ♫

647
00:50:14,300 --> 00:50:15,800
Are you over it yet?

648
00:50:16,700 --> 00:50:18,500
Over it.

649
00:50:22,300 --> 00:50:26,400
In the future, no matter if you're in Taiwan or abroad,

650
00:50:26,400 --> 00:50:28,499
whether it's calling you or texting you,

651
00:50:28,500 --> 00:50:30,599
if you disappear again,

652
00:50:30,600 --> 00:50:32,400
we're not brothers.

653
00:50:38,900 --> 00:50:40,800
I won't do that again.

654
00:50:42,800 --> 00:50:44,299
What are your plans?

655
00:50:44,300 --> 00:50:46,900
What will you do after graduating?

656
00:50:48,600 --> 00:50:51,699
I want to stay abroad for a couple of more years.

657
00:50:51,700 --> 00:50:54,299
I want to find different places to travel to.

658
00:50:54,300 --> 00:50:57,899
Get to know more people and do more things.

659
00:50:59,600 --> 00:51:01,700
This world is very big

660
00:51:03,100 --> 00:51:04,700
Really.

661
00:51:10,200 --> 00:51:12,699
I have something that I've been wanting to ask you.

662
00:51:12,700 --> 00:51:15,399
But if you don't want to answer, that's fine, too.

663
00:51:15,400 --> 00:51:18,299
That time you told me, you didn't like boys.

664
00:51:18,299 --> 00:51:20,399
You only liked Yu Shigu.

665
00:51:20,400 --> 00:51:22,899
But now that you've met him,

666
00:51:22,900 --> 00:51:24,999
you don't have any feelings

667
00:51:25,000 --> 00:51:27,500
or want to try.

668
00:51:45,600 --> 00:51:48,000
Because no one can replace him.

669
00:51:56,800 --> 00:51:58,500
Understood.

670
00:52:01,100 --> 00:52:03,700
I will make a trip to the Himalayan mountains later.

671
00:52:08,000 --> 00:52:12,700
I feel that I'm ready to see him.

672
00:52:24,900 --> 00:52:28,399
Stop talking about me. How about you guys?

673
00:52:28,399 --> 00:52:30,099
What about us?

674
00:52:30,100 --> 00:52:33,200
Do you have any plans? It's been six years already.

675
00:52:33,200 --> 00:52:35,400
Plans?

676
00:52:35,400 --> 00:52:37,499
I really want to get married.

677
00:52:37,500 --> 00:52:40,099
But he's super career-driven.

678
00:52:40,100 --> 00:52:42,400
Busy.

679
00:52:42,400 --> 00:52:45,900
See, I told you. You didn't want to listen.

680
00:52:45,900 --> 00:52:51,299
Just the other day, we were talking about a dog and started arguing.

681
00:52:51,800 --> 00:52:55,600
I've noticed that we like arguing over very little and insignificant things.

682
00:52:55,600 --> 00:52:57,400
When he starts nagging,

683
00:52:59,200 --> 00:53:00,599
I really can't stand it.

684
00:53:00,600 --> 00:53:02,999
Do you know what we fought about?

685
00:53:03,000 --> 00:53:06,199
I said I wanted to get a Doberman. Super cool.

686
00:53:06,200 --> 00:53:08,500
He said he wanted a French bulldog.

687
00:53:10,900 --> 00:53:12,299
Very cute.

688
00:53:12,300 --> 00:53:15,500
We argued and argued. Argued until we agreed.

689
00:53:15,500 --> 00:53:19,400
We decided to go to the dog shelter.

690
00:53:19,400 --> 00:53:22,200
He said he wanted to let fate let us meet our dog.

691
00:53:22,200 --> 00:53:23,399
Why leave it to fate?

692
00:53:23,400 --> 00:53:25,599
Just ask him to take you in.

693
00:53:25,600 --> 00:53:27,700
I'm the one that's taking him in.

694
00:53:29,500 --> 00:53:30,900
Please!

695
00:53:32,300 --> 00:53:34,000
Silly!

696
00:53:35,660 --> 00:53:42,160
[When we're pushed to move forward by time,
that's when we realize all the precious memories in our hearts
are all the "that day" when we walked together]

697
00:53:42,160 --> 00:53:47,310
[Best, Every "That Day"]

698
00:53:47,310 --> 00:53:52,300
[The End]

♫ I still don’t understand why you left ♫

700
00:53:57,690 --> 00:54:03,740
♫ I still don’t understand why I’m waiting ♫

701
00:54:03,740 --> 00:54:09,460
♫ Waiting for who will remember their responsibility ♫

702
00:54:09,460 --> 00:54:15,250
♫ I’m left at the original place wandering around alone ♫

703
00:54:15,250 --> 00:54:20,700
♫ When the blue sky and white clouds disappear ♫

704
00:54:20,700 --> 00:54:25,990
♫ When you take away the yellow sneakers and the red sweater ♫

705
00:54:25,990 --> 00:54:31,360
♫ When all the colors are gone along with you ♫

706
00:54:31,360 --> 00:54:38,130
♫ Only transparent tears that unceasingly fall accompany me ♫

707
00:54:38,130 --> 00:54:43,590
♫ I still don’t understand why you left ♫

♫ I still don’t understand why I’m waiting ♫

♫ Waiting for who will remember their responsibility ♫

♫ I’m left at the original place wandering around alone ♫

711
00:54:59,770 --> 00:55:05,030
♫ When one story becomes two regrets ♫

712
00:55:05,030 --> 00:55:11,530
♫ Letting two hearts run towards two different futures ♫

713
00:55:11,530 --> 00:55:16,930
♫ All those that can’t be forgotten can only become regrets ♫

714
00:55:16,930 --> 00:55:25,470
♫ But I still can’t understand why the tears won’t stop ♫
