[HIStory 3: Make Our Days Count]
[Episode 8]

13
00:01:49,300 --> 00:01:51,233
This is too empty.

14
00:01:53,100 --> 00:01:54,699
What is?

15
00:01:54,700 --> 00:01:56,900
You can't shut the door.

16
00:01:59,100 --> 00:02:01,800
Xiang Yongching.

17
00:02:06,200 --> 00:02:07,400
Mom and dad aren't home.

18
00:02:07,400 --> 00:02:09,200
Can't you just give us a break?

19
00:02:09,200 --> 00:02:11,399
- Mom said, you're an animal and a monster!
- Me--

20
00:02:11,399 --> 00:02:13,400
The door must be kept open!

21
00:02:15,300 --> 00:02:17,199
How much do you want?

22
00:02:17,200 --> 00:02:18,799
It's not a matter of how much.

23
00:02:18,800 --> 00:02:21,599
Your sister's right. Don't close the door.

24
00:02:21,599 --> 00:02:23,800
Hurry up and start studying!

25
00:02:25,900 --> 00:02:28,000
Just leave it like this.

26
00:02:31,400 --> 00:02:34,300
- You haven't memorized the formulas.
- Study hard!

27
00:02:37,400 --> 00:02:40,799
Look over here. Parabola.

28
00:02:40,799 --> 00:02:43,632
The square of bracket Y minus 2...

29
00:02:43,633 --> 00:02:47,199
equals the intersection of 8 bracket x plus 1.

30
00:02:47,200 --> 00:02:48,799
And the tangent line...

31
00:02:48,800 --> 00:02:51,132
Teacher Huang told us that when we see this,

32
00:02:51,132 --> 00:02:54,033
we have to focus on the intersection point first.

33
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:56,799
Next, the square of Y minus 2...

34
00:02:56,800 --> 00:02:58,700
Do you know how to solve it?

35
00:02:59,633 --> 00:03:01,800
Then calculate this first.

36
00:03:03,300 --> 00:03:05,000
Xiang Haoting!

37
00:03:06,533 --> 00:03:08,400
Weren't you going to give me a reward.

38
00:03:13,300 --> 00:03:15,700
- What is this?
- A reward.

39
00:03:21,300 --> 00:03:23,000
Anything else.

40
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:25,399
What else?

41
00:03:25,400 --> 00:03:27,299
That's it.

42
00:03:27,300 --> 00:03:30,100
I don't care. I want more!

43
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:38,632
I thought that you were going to give me more rewards for not going to your celebration dinner.

44
00:03:38,632 --> 00:03:40,532
You're playing me.

45
00:03:40,533 --> 00:03:41,999
We haven't officially started going out yet.

46
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:43,599
We need to wait until you get into a national university before it's okay.

47
00:03:43,600 --> 00:03:44,999
No!

48
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:46,432
Don't be so technical about it.

49
00:03:46,433 --> 00:03:47,699
You did so poorly on your placement testing.

50
00:03:47,700 --> 00:03:49,600
Do you still want us to be together?

51
00:03:49,600 --> 00:03:51,100
Of course.

52
00:03:52,500 --> 00:03:54,832
But I want my reward.

53
00:03:54,833 --> 00:03:58,299
Okay, forget studying and forget about being together.

54
00:04:04,300 --> 00:04:06,233
I'm sorry.

55
00:04:09,900 --> 00:04:12,899
I'm not taking this seriously.

56
00:04:12,900 --> 00:04:15,099
Starting from today, I will study much harder,

57
00:04:15,100 --> 00:04:18,100
concentrate more, and put more effort into this!

58
00:04:29,700 --> 00:04:35,399
When you get into college, I will swallow both you and the Lollipop.

59
00:04:39,300 --> 00:04:41,000
Thank you.

60
00:04:45,700 --> 00:04:47,699
I don't know how to solve this question.

61
00:04:47,700 --> 00:04:50,100
This one.

62
00:04:50,100 --> 00:04:52,400
First, you need to find the intersecting point.

63
00:04:56,633 --> 00:04:58,300
Negative 1.2.

64
00:05:01,400 --> 00:05:02,900
Keep going!

65
00:05:07,650 --> 00:05:08,999
Gao Xiao-chun, give me a pack!

66
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:10,100
Gao Xiao-chun, I want some!

67
00:05:10,100 --> 00:05:11,200
I don't want to eat this!

68
00:05:11,201 --> 00:05:13,100
What is this?

69
00:05:16,800 --> 00:05:20,599
Is this the legendary man who will do whatever it takes for love?

70
00:05:21,333 --> 00:05:23,333
So handsome.

71
00:05:25,200 --> 00:05:27,599
It's Xiang Haoting.

72
00:05:27,600 --> 00:05:30,033
So this is what being in love is like.

73
00:05:38,600 --> 00:05:40,933
Sun Bo.

74
00:05:43,033 --> 00:05:44,900
Not even close!

75
00:05:46,533 --> 00:05:48,800
Give it to Gao Xiao-chun.

76
00:05:50,433 --> 00:05:53,100
No way!

77
00:05:57,800 --> 00:06:00,000
What are you doing?

78
00:06:10,300 --> 00:06:13,999
How many light years have we distanced ourselves from the stars?

79
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:17,999
Using 32.6 lightyears as a reference.

80
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:18,900
Xiang Haoting.

81
00:06:18,900 --> 00:06:19,800
Yes!

82
00:06:19,801 --> 00:06:21,399
You're sleeping in class?

83
00:06:21,400 --> 00:06:23,599
I'm not.

84
00:06:23,600 --> 00:06:25,632
I'm taking notes.

85
00:06:25,633 --> 00:06:29,499
Let me see if you're taking notes or sleeping. We'll find out right now.

86
00:06:29,499 --> 00:06:32,599
Okay, the color of the star and its surface temperature.

87
00:06:32,600 --> 00:06:35,099
He Weiguang, answer.

88
00:06:35,100 --> 00:06:37,400
The general term for electromagnetic waves.

89
00:06:40,100 --> 00:06:42,099
The two bands observed by astronomy.

90
00:06:42,100 --> 00:06:43,800
Answer.

91
00:06:44,400 --> 00:06:47,399
Visible light and...

92
00:06:47,400 --> 00:06:48,999
radio waves.

93
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:51,899
- Not bad.
- Nice!

94
00:06:51,900 --> 00:06:54,533
What's everyone doing? Applaud.

95
00:07:05,200 --> 00:07:08,732
You have to remember the difference between this and this,

96
00:07:08,732 --> 00:07:10,299
because these are very similar.

97
00:07:10,300 --> 00:07:12,099
If you aren't careful,

98
00:07:12,100 --> 00:07:14,499
you won't be able to finish the rest of the questions.

99
00:07:14,500 --> 00:07:17,599
This... I feel you can just delete it completely.

100
00:07:17,600 --> 00:07:19,400
The one in the front--

101
00:07:20,200 --> 00:07:21,899
What's up with you?

102
00:07:21,900 --> 00:07:24,701
I don't know. I'm feeling a bit sick.

103
00:07:25,833 --> 00:07:27,500
- Let me see.
- It's fine.

104
00:07:27,500 --> 00:07:29,200
Let me see.

105
00:07:51,300 --> 00:07:52,599
Your mouth is a little dirty.

106
00:07:52,600 --> 00:07:55,801
Look, it's so oily. You didn't wipe properly after eating lunch. See?

107
00:07:55,801 --> 00:07:58,800
Now, I have to go wash my hands.

108
00:08:00,100 --> 00:08:03,999
Is it still... dirty?

109
00:08:11,733 --> 00:08:14,600
Xiang Haoting, what are you doing?

110
00:08:15,100 --> 00:08:17,533
What just happened?

111
00:08:19,100 --> 00:08:23,099
But he was so... so delicious.

112
00:08:24,400 --> 00:08:26,199
No.

113
00:08:26,200 --> 00:08:28,333
The exams are just around the corner.

114
00:08:32,900 --> 00:08:35,133
I really want...

115
00:08:36,200 --> 00:08:38,000
No.

116
00:08:38,600 --> 00:08:40,299
Calm down.

117
00:08:40,300 --> 00:08:41,933
Fighting!

118
00:08:50,433 --> 00:08:52,333
What are you doing here?

119
00:08:53,100 --> 00:08:55,300
You don't recognize me?

120
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:57,999
Long time no see!

121
00:08:58,000 --> 00:08:59,099
What are you doing here?

122
00:08:59,100 --> 00:09:01,000
Buying some books.

123
00:09:05,150 --> 00:09:08,099
I never thought I'd get a lift from a big star.

124
00:09:08,100 --> 00:09:10,000
Give me a break.

125
00:09:13,800 --> 00:09:15,799
I wanted to ask just now.

126
00:09:15,800 --> 00:09:17,432
You've graduated a while now from high school.

127
00:09:17,433 --> 00:09:20,833
These books... I bought them for a friend.

128
00:09:21,533 --> 00:09:23,200
Friend?

129
00:09:32,100 --> 00:09:34,299
A boyfriend, right?

130
00:09:34,300 --> 00:09:35,800
Yeah.

131
00:09:36,400 --> 00:09:38,000
What's the matter?

132
00:09:39,800 --> 00:09:41,599
Nothing.

133
00:09:41,600 --> 00:09:43,500
A boyfriend is good.

134
00:09:46,300 --> 00:09:48,400
How's your family?

135
00:09:49,400 --> 00:09:50,799
Everyone's fine.

136
00:09:50,800 --> 00:09:52,399
Everyone's healthy.

137
00:09:52,400 --> 00:09:55,100
How about you? You need to study and work.

138
00:09:55,100 --> 00:09:58,099
I heard that the design department is a lot of pressure.

139
00:09:58,100 --> 00:09:59,833
It is a lot.

140
00:10:00,800 --> 00:10:02,800
But I'm already used to it now.

141
00:10:04,633 --> 00:10:07,699
Do you have someone now?

142
00:10:07,700 --> 00:10:11,533
What's that supposed to mean? Are you trying to get some gossip on a big star?

143
00:10:13,900 --> 00:10:15,899
But I want to thank you.

144
00:10:15,900 --> 00:10:17,932
Thank me for what?

145
00:10:17,933 --> 00:10:21,532
Thank you for your heroic sacrifice to fend off all the pressure

146
00:10:21,532 --> 00:10:25,300
so that I could be able to live the way I want in front of my family.

147
00:10:26,400 --> 00:10:29,399
Then, today's meal is on you.

148
00:10:29,400 --> 00:10:30,999
I'm just a student.

149
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:34,800
Student? It's always convenient for you to say you're a student at times like this.

150
00:10:42,600 --> 00:10:46,799
My mom and grandma both miss you very much.

151
00:10:47,400 --> 00:10:52,799
But I don't know if Grandpa misses you or not.

152
00:10:53,900 --> 00:10:55,399
Because everyone is still the same.

153
00:10:55,400 --> 00:10:58,899
Scared to bring up your name in front of Grandpa.

154
00:11:02,400 --> 00:11:04,100
But!

155
00:11:05,700 --> 00:11:08,999
I'm sensing and I have a feeling.

156
00:11:11,600 --> 00:11:15,599
It won't be long before you come home, Uncle.

157
00:11:18,800 --> 00:11:22,433
Please sense what we're going to eat later.

158
00:11:22,433 --> 00:11:23,899
Wait.

159
00:11:23,900 --> 00:11:26,099
- I'm telling you, you can't water them that way.
- Be careful.

160
00:11:26,100 --> 00:11:27,932
You have to love these plants and flowers.

161
00:11:27,933 --> 00:11:32,200
You need to really focus to nourish them, okay?

162
00:11:32,200 --> 00:11:34,600
Sun Bo, this time, I'll let you use this one.

163
00:11:34,600 --> 00:11:36,832
Next time, you hold this; see how much love you have.

164
00:11:36,832 --> 00:11:37,833
Why do you keep looking at me?

165
00:11:37,834 --> 00:11:39,299
If you don't have love, stop blaming the hardware.

166
00:11:39,300 --> 00:11:41,432
Because you're cuter than the flower.

167
00:11:41,433 --> 00:11:42,832
Right!

168
00:11:42,833 --> 00:11:44,199
- You started–
- You tickled me first.

169
00:11:44,200 --> 00:11:46,133
- Are you sure you want to tickle me?
- Don't come any closer.

170
00:11:46,133 --> 00:11:47,400
No. Don't!

171
00:11:47,400 --> 00:11:48,599
Hello!

172
00:11:48,600 --> 00:11:50,299
Hello, two fellow students!

173
00:11:50,300 --> 00:11:52,299
Um, this is the school.

174
00:11:52,300 --> 00:11:53,000
So?

175
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:54,999
Can you stop doing that flirting thing?

176
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:58,132
What's wrong? Are you jealous?

177
00:11:58,132 --> 00:11:59,800
Actually, a little bit.

178
00:11:59,800 --> 00:12:01,999
- Aren't you scared I'll squirt you?
- Don't!

179
00:12:01,999 --> 00:12:04,832
Spray me, don't spray him!

180
00:12:04,833 --> 00:12:05,800
Stop messing around!

181
00:12:05,801 --> 00:12:08,000
Spray him!

182
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:11,399
Aim!

183
00:12:11,400 --> 00:12:13,532
Yu Shigu! Don't come any closer!

184
00:12:13,532 --> 00:12:15,532
Move!

185
00:12:15,533 --> 00:12:16,533
Get out of the way!

186
00:12:16,534 --> 00:12:19,300
Stop protecting him every time!

187
00:12:19,300 --> 00:12:21,333
I'm spraying!

188
00:12:22,900 --> 00:12:24,900
I'll protect you!

189
00:12:25,600 --> 00:12:27,400
Traitor!

190
00:12:28,100 --> 00:12:29,732
Get out of the way!

191
00:12:29,733 --> 00:12:31,700
Stop hiding!

192
00:12:35,800 --> 00:12:38,600
- What are you hiding beside him for?
- I'll protect you!

193
00:12:38,600 --> 00:12:41,099
Stop protecting him. Move!

194
00:12:44,900 --> 00:12:46,100
Attack them!

195
00:12:46,100 --> 00:12:47,800
Move!

196
00:12:48,700 --> 00:12:50,499
Yu Shigu!

197
00:12:50,500 --> 00:12:52,600
Annoying Gu. Come on!

198
00:12:52,600 --> 00:12:56,000
I thought you were scared! Grab it!

199
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:58,833
Help, Brothers!

200
00:12:58,833 --> 00:13:01,833
Give me a little bit. Cut me some slack.

201
00:13:01,833 --> 00:13:04,200
Sun Bo, move to the front!

202
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:08,000
Help, come on!

203
00:13:12,600 --> 00:13:13,999
Gao Xiao-chun, go and attack them!

204
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:16,932
Gao Xiao-chun!

205
00:13:16,933 --> 00:13:19,933
I don't know why am I always on top!

206
00:13:28,733 --> 00:13:30,832
Surprise!

207
00:13:30,833 --> 00:13:32,799
Shouldn't you be studying?

208
00:13:32,800 --> 00:13:34,833
Happy Birthday.

209
00:13:36,200 --> 00:13:38,700
Are you joking? Eighteen years old.

210
00:13:38,700 --> 00:13:41,932
How can you not celebrate your eighteenth birthday?

211
00:13:41,933 --> 00:13:43,433
Look.

212
00:13:44,800 --> 00:13:48,499
For you, I made this myself.

213
00:13:51,200 --> 00:13:53,800
A firefly can bake cakes.

214
00:13:56,400 --> 00:14:01,280
♪ Happy Birthday to you ♪

215
00:14:02,230 --> 00:14:09,900
♪ Happy Birthday to you ♪

216
00:14:11,533 --> 00:14:12,632
Happy Birthday!

217
00:14:12,633 --> 00:14:14,300
Make a wish.

218
00:14:18,300 --> 00:14:20,299
First wish.

219
00:14:20,300 --> 00:14:23,599
I hope that Xiang Haoting will get into a top-five school.

220
00:14:23,600 --> 00:14:25,299
Such a waste.

221
00:14:25,300 --> 00:14:26,499
You don't need to waste a wish on this.

222
00:14:26,500 --> 00:14:29,000
For sure, I'll get in.

223
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:30,499
I hope so!

224
00:14:30,500 --> 00:14:32,499
Quick, number two.

225
00:14:32,500 --> 00:14:34,599
Second wish.

226
00:14:34,600 --> 00:14:37,832
I hope that Aunt, Brother Chigang and Sun Bo,

227
00:14:37,833 --> 00:14:40,199
Xia En, Xia De, Gao Chun

228
00:14:40,200 --> 00:14:42,600
will all be safe and healthy.

229
00:14:44,600 --> 00:14:45,600
All right, all right.!

230
00:14:45,600 --> 00:14:46,600
Your third wish.

231
00:14:46,601 --> 00:14:48,500
Can't say it out loud!

232
00:15:02,600 --> 00:15:04,400
Blow out the candles.

233
00:15:26,600 --> 00:15:28,333
Thank you.

234
00:15:38,300 --> 00:15:40,100
How is it?

235
00:15:41,300 --> 00:15:42,699
It's good.

236
00:15:42,700 --> 00:15:45,000
This is all for you.

237
00:16:02,200 --> 00:16:03,900
Let's take a picture.

238
00:16:24,500 --> 00:16:26,600
Xiang Haoting,

239
00:16:27,600 --> 00:16:30,133
you can't run away.

240
00:17:02,200 --> 00:17:05,000
Fighting! Okay.

241
00:17:16,500 --> 00:17:18,333
Okay.

242
00:17:22,300 --> 00:17:23,499
Son!

243
00:17:23,500 --> 00:17:25,899
- Mommy.
- Hungry?

244
00:17:25,899 --> 00:17:27,899
So hungry.

245
00:17:27,900 --> 00:17:30,500
You're working so hard.

246
00:17:31,500 --> 00:17:33,399
Thank you, Mommy.

247
00:17:33,400 --> 00:17:35,100
Try it.

248
00:17:37,600 --> 00:17:40,299
How does it taste?

249
00:17:40,300 --> 00:17:41,899
Very good.

250
00:17:41,900 --> 00:17:44,000
Your dad cooked it.

251
00:18:00,900 --> 00:18:04,200
The caramel topping on the pudding just now was delicious.

252
00:18:05,700 --> 00:18:08,200
Oh right! You need to self-study a bit more for the quiz.

253
00:18:08,200 --> 00:18:09,632
That's really important.

254
00:18:09,633 --> 00:18:12,100
I marked the main points for you already.

255
00:18:15,900 --> 00:18:18,500
What's up with you? Are you okay?

256
00:18:18,500 --> 00:18:21,499
Nothing, I was just thinking.

257
00:18:21,500 --> 00:18:24,299
Now that you've scheduled your weekends full with work.

258
00:18:24,300 --> 00:18:26,399
Besides, I'm pretty well prepared with my studies.

259
00:18:26,400 --> 00:18:28,732
I'm okay on my own for the rest.

260
00:18:28,733 --> 00:18:30,199
It's okay.

261
00:18:30,200 --> 00:18:31,999
I will use my time wisely.

262
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:35,099
Before school starts, I'll be able to make a bit more money.

263
00:18:35,099 --> 00:18:36,732
You can't.

264
00:18:36,733 --> 00:18:39,600
What if you tire yourself out?

265
00:18:40,700 --> 00:18:42,799
Then you better come home with me.

266
00:18:42,800 --> 00:18:45,399
I have to give Genius some notes.

267
00:18:45,400 --> 00:18:48,199
It's okay. Just give them to me tomorrow.

268
00:18:48,199 --> 00:18:50,700
I'll head home first, bye.

269
00:18:53,700 --> 00:18:55,500
Bye-bye.

270
00:18:59,400 --> 00:19:01,800
In the end, it was up to the three countries of China, the U.S., and England

271
00:19:01,800 --> 00:19:03,599
to confirm the results of the Cairo summit.

272
00:19:03,600 --> 00:19:05,799
Which was that Japan must surrender unconditionally.

273
00:19:05,800 --> 00:19:06,633
Any questions?

274
00:19:06,634 --> 00:19:07,732
No!

275
00:19:07,733 --> 00:19:10,233
Then we'll stop here for today. Class is dismissed!

276
00:19:22,533 --> 00:19:25,300
I'm going to the cafeteria, need me to get you anything?

277
00:19:27,500 --> 00:19:29,200
Shigu.

278
00:19:30,100 --> 00:19:32,800
I don't need anything. Thanks.

279
00:19:32,800 --> 00:19:34,600
Then I'm going.

280
00:19:41,400 --> 00:19:43,400
You didn't even look!

281
00:19:45,300 --> 00:19:46,933
Sun Bo!

282
00:19:48,433 --> 00:19:49,999
Are you looking for Xiang Haoting?

283
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:52,599
Yeah, where is he?

284
00:19:52,600 --> 00:19:55,099
He asked for a sick day and took the day off. He didn't tell you?

285
00:19:55,099 --> 00:19:57,599
Sick day? No.

286
00:19:57,599 --> 00:19:59,899
That's weird

287
00:19:59,900 --> 00:20:01,899
When I called him and asked him,

288
00:20:01,899 --> 00:20:04,299
he kept spouting English vocabulary.

289
00:20:04,300 --> 00:20:06,999
He's probably crazy.

290
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:08,532
Did he say what was wrong with him?

291
00:20:08,533 --> 00:20:10,600
I thought he would tell you!

292
00:20:14,633 --> 00:20:18,199
It's probably from overuse of his brain lately and too much pressure

293
00:20:18,199 --> 00:20:19,799
and his body is feeling weak.

294
00:20:19,800 --> 00:20:24,199
That's why he's like this all of a sudden and got a fever.

295
00:20:24,199 --> 00:20:26,800
That's too bad.

296
00:20:26,800 --> 00:20:28,399
He kicked his covers off again.

297
00:20:28,400 --> 00:20:29,999
Last night was like this, too.

298
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:31,899
His fever's been up and down.

299
00:20:31,900 --> 00:20:35,600
He said he was dizzy and hit his head.

300
00:20:35,600 --> 00:20:39,700
Good thing, we took him to the doctor this morning.

301
00:20:39,700 --> 00:20:42,300
How could this have happened?

302
00:20:42,300 --> 00:20:45,299
Auntie, what did the doctor say?

303
00:20:45,299 --> 00:20:48,200
The doctor said that it'll be okay. He just needs to get some rest,

304
00:20:48,200 --> 00:20:49,999
take the medication on time, and just let him sweat it out

305
00:20:49,999 --> 00:20:52,700
then he'll get better faster.

306
00:20:54,300 --> 00:20:57,000
Good thing you're here. I need to go out with Dad in a little bit.

307
00:20:57,000 --> 00:20:59,100
Can you take care of him for me for a while?

308
00:20:59,100 --> 00:21:01,299
I'm sorry.

309
00:21:01,300 --> 00:21:03,299
Hello, Mr. Liu.

310
00:21:03,300 --> 00:21:04,799
I'm leaving right now.

311
00:21:04,800 --> 00:21:07,800
We'll be there in about ten minutes.

312
00:21:09,900 --> 00:21:10,533
Right!

313
00:21:10,534 --> 00:21:11,899
Okay, see you in a bit.

314
00:21:11,900 --> 00:21:14,433
Okay, goodbye.

315
00:21:24,200 --> 00:21:26,100
Xiang Haoting.

316
00:21:28,200 --> 00:21:30,100
Xiang Haoting.

317
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:32,833
Why are you so hot?

318
00:21:34,900 --> 00:21:36,400
Yu Shi...

319
00:21:40,600 --> 00:21:42,800
So hot.

320
00:22:03,600 --> 00:22:05,199
Lie down!

321
00:22:05,200 --> 00:22:07,330
You have a fever, don't do that!

322
00:22:07,330 --> 00:22:09,270
Come over here.

323
00:22:10,300 --> 00:22:12,400
I missed you so much.

324
00:22:16,820 --> 00:22:19,340
Stay put.

325
00:22:19,340 --> 00:22:21,230
Get better sooner.

326
00:22:29,100 --> 00:22:31,000
Give it to me.

327
00:22:33,700 --> 00:22:35,199
I really want you.

328
00:22:35,200 --> 00:22:37,500
Stop fooling around!

329
00:22:46,600 --> 00:22:48,300
Xiang Haoting.

330
00:23:09,533 --> 00:23:11,400
Help me.

331
00:23:36,300 --> 00:23:37,732
I will also help you!

332
00:23:37,733 --> 00:23:39,400
No need.

333
00:25:06,100 --> 00:25:08,999
Why are you here?

334
00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:10,700
I...

335
00:25:13,900 --> 00:25:16,300
I came to give some notes to your brother.

336
00:25:24,800 --> 00:25:27,133
So weird.

337
00:25:47,533 --> 00:25:50,400
The exams are almost here. Are you nervous?

338
00:25:50,400 --> 00:25:52,499
I'm okay.

339
00:25:52,500 --> 00:25:55,199
I'm just still a bit lacking.

340
00:25:55,200 --> 00:25:57,999
Lacking? Lacking what?

341
00:25:58,000 --> 00:25:59,800
Lacking you.

342
00:26:11,900 --> 00:26:13,900
You really kissed me.

343
00:26:15,100 --> 00:26:16,900
You didn't want me to?

344
00:26:19,000 --> 00:26:21,000
Five more kisses, please!

345
00:26:22,400 --> 00:26:24,299
You little naughty kid!

346
00:26:24,300 --> 00:26:26,200
You're too greedy.

347
00:26:30,600 --> 00:26:32,400
Thank you.

348
00:26:37,400 --> 00:26:39,833
Thank you for showing up in my life,

349
00:26:40,400 --> 00:26:43,200
and making my life worthwhile.

350
00:26:46,200 --> 00:26:48,932
No matter what happens,

351
00:26:48,933 --> 00:26:51,532
as long as you continue to be with me,

352
00:26:51,533 --> 00:26:52,999
love me,

353
00:26:53,000 --> 00:26:55,300
it's enough.

354
00:27:05,533 --> 00:27:07,199
- Sister.
- Yeah.

355
00:27:07,200 --> 00:27:09,900
Mom's got to go to the travel agency.

356
00:27:11,700 --> 00:27:14,000
Mommy, you're so cute today.

357
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:15,099
What day am I not cute?

358
00:27:15,100 --> 00:27:17,199
This way, your dad will always like me.

359
00:27:17,200 --> 00:27:18,299
Yes.

360
00:27:18,300 --> 00:27:19,699
Mommy.

361
00:27:19,700 --> 00:27:20,899
You're awake.

362
00:27:20,900 --> 00:27:22,299
You're up?

363
00:27:22,300 --> 00:27:23,700
Mommy needs to go out.

364
00:27:23,700 --> 00:27:25,200
What is it?

365
00:27:26,933 --> 00:27:28,299
Why are you sweating so much?

366
00:27:28,300 --> 00:27:30,299
I want to go take a shower first.

367
00:27:30,300 --> 00:27:32,500
Remember to take your medicine.

368
00:27:34,500 --> 00:27:37,733
Right. You need to thank your classmate, Yu Shigu.

369
00:27:37,733 --> 00:27:38,932
Yes, Yu Shigu.

370
00:27:38,933 --> 00:27:41,832
- Why?
- Why? You forgot?

371
00:27:41,832 --> 00:27:42,999
I forgot.

372
00:27:43,000 --> 00:27:46,200
Yesterday afternoon, he came to help me take care of you.

373
00:27:51,100 --> 00:27:53,099
Yesterday?

374
00:27:53,100 --> 00:27:54,532
He came yesterday?

375
00:27:54,533 --> 00:27:55,500
Yes.

376
00:27:55,501 --> 00:27:57,799
He said he came to drop off some notes for you.

377
00:27:57,800 --> 00:27:58,899
Yesterday?

378
00:27:58,900 --> 00:28:00,500
Yeah.

379
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:05,532
So it wasn't a dream after all.

380
00:28:05,533 --> 00:28:08,432
You really are sick?

381
00:28:08,433 --> 00:28:10,299
Sister, please take care of your brother for me.

382
00:28:10,300 --> 00:28:11,699
If anything happens, call me okay.

383
00:28:11,700 --> 00:28:12,899
Okay.

384
00:28:12,900 --> 00:28:15,099
I'm running late! I really need to go now.

385
00:28:15,099 --> 00:28:16,000
Hurry, bye-bye.

386
00:28:16,001 --> 00:28:18,000
Mommy, bye-bye.

387
00:28:36,200 --> 00:28:38,500
Xiang Yongching.

388
00:28:40,100 --> 00:28:41,499
Your brother succeeded!

389
00:28:41,500 --> 00:28:43,400
What?

390
00:28:50,433 --> 00:28:52,633
You're sick.

391
00:29:25,400 --> 00:29:26,600
Haoting.

392
00:29:28,400 --> 00:29:30,100
Haoting.

393
00:29:40,200 --> 00:29:42,599
Yu Shigu.

394
00:29:42,600 --> 00:29:45,999
You... Are you mad?

395
00:29:51,200 --> 00:29:54,100
Me... Yesterday with my high fever, I don't remember too much.

396
00:29:54,100 --> 00:29:56,099
Everything is kind of unclear and in bits and pieces!

397
00:29:56,100 --> 00:29:57,520
I--

398
00:30:03,100 --> 00:30:05,100
I'm sorry.

399
00:30:09,500 --> 00:30:11,199
Yesterday, I--

400
00:30:11,200 --> 00:30:15,099
Did I do... that?

401
00:30:15,099 --> 00:30:17,000
Really, no.

402
00:30:18,800 --> 00:30:22,299
Actually... we...

403
00:30:29,000 --> 00:30:31,600
we actually...

404
00:30:38,300 --> 00:30:40,340
Actually what?

405
00:30:41,500 --> 00:30:43,230
Just...

406
00:30:44,300 --> 00:30:46,500
Just that...

407
00:31:10,633 --> 00:31:13,100
We didn't do that.

408
00:31:15,800 --> 00:31:17,533
Just touched.

409
00:31:32,700 --> 00:31:34,400
I'm sorry.

410
00:31:36,100 --> 00:31:40,299
Just one month left and I'm still like this.

411
00:31:45,900 --> 00:31:48,090
It's okay.

412
00:31:48,800 --> 00:31:50,899
I know you didn't do it on purpose.

413
00:31:50,900 --> 00:31:54,499
Besides, I'll know you'll get in for sure!

414
00:31:57,733 --> 00:31:59,699
I'm doing it for you.

415
00:31:59,700 --> 00:32:02,099
For sure.

416
00:32:02,100 --> 00:32:04,200
For sure, I'll make it happen!

417
00:32:05,070 --> 00:32:08,450
♫ ...lean on my back ♫

418
00:32:08,450 --> 00:32:13,220
♫ Let yourself have a good cry ♫

419
00:32:13,220 --> 00:32:19,010
♫ I will face you with my back and not disrupt your tears ♫

420
00:32:19,010 --> 00:32:22,350
♫ Let yourself be fragile for once ♫

421
00:32:22,350 --> 00:32:27,500
♫ I will be like this in front of you ♫

422
00:32:27,500 --> 00:32:32,100
♫ At the time that you need it, gently say ‘Hey’ ♫

423
00:32:32,100 --> 00:32:35,099
Dad, you're so nervous.

424
00:32:35,100 --> 00:32:35,800
A little.

425
00:32:35,801 --> 00:32:37,399
Me, too.

426
00:32:37,400 --> 00:32:39,000
What is it?

427
00:32:39,000 --> 00:32:41,399
Just checking the web for the mark analysis.

428
00:32:41,400 --> 00:32:45,599
Even though the scores are high, if we want to get into the top five,

429
00:32:45,599 --> 00:32:47,600
it's still be quite difficult.

430
00:32:50,200 --> 00:32:53,500
Daddy! That's my cup.

431
00:32:53,500 --> 00:32:55,399
You're my wife. It's okay for me to take a sip.

432
00:32:55,399 --> 00:32:57,933
But that's coffee! I'm scared you won't be able to sleep tonight.

433
00:32:57,933 --> 00:33:00,300
Didn't he have insomnia last night?

434
00:33:02,700 --> 00:33:05,300
National Central University!

435
00:33:06,300 --> 00:33:08,600
I can get into National Central University!

436
00:33:11,900 --> 00:33:13,200
I--

437
00:33:14,000 --> 00:33:16,399
I'm going to look for Yu Shigu!

438
00:33:16,400 --> 00:33:17,999
- Xiang Haoting.
- Daddy.

439
00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:19,700
You already agreed.

440
00:33:19,700 --> 00:33:22,899
You said yourself, people need to have credibility. You can't take back what you said.

441
00:33:25,500 --> 00:33:26,999
Daddy, it's fine.

442
00:33:27,000 --> 00:33:28,999
Don't think too much about it now.

443
00:33:29,000 --> 00:33:32,599
He got into a good school now which is a very good thing!

444
00:33:32,599 --> 00:33:35,300
Regarding what's going on with that young boy and being together,

445
00:33:35,300 --> 00:33:37,600
just don't worry about it for now.

446
00:33:38,300 --> 00:33:40,733
Finally, we can relax. Have some coffee.

447
00:33:55,900 --> 00:33:57,779
If you're worried,

448
00:33:57,780 --> 00:33:59,579
just call him.

449
00:33:59,580 --> 00:34:03,000
I can't. He's already under a lot of pressure.

450
00:34:03,000 --> 00:34:06,799
If I call him, he'll feel even more pressure.

451
00:34:09,100 --> 00:34:13,132
If he doesn't get in, then what?

452
00:34:14,800 --> 00:34:17,299
I don't know either.

453
00:34:17,300 --> 00:34:20,999
But I'll do my best to comfort him.

454
00:34:21,000 --> 00:34:22,699
What I mean is...

455
00:34:22,700 --> 00:34:26,732
If his parents won't allow it, then what will you guys do?

456
00:34:29,400 --> 00:34:32,133
The two of you already assumed you'd be together.

457
00:34:34,300 --> 00:34:36,433
Good morning.

458
00:35:01,000 --> 00:35:02,699
So, what's the verdict?

459
00:35:02,700 --> 00:35:04,299
National Central University!

460
00:35:04,300 --> 00:35:06,299
- I got it!
- Really?

461
00:35:06,299 --> 00:35:08,400
For sure, I'm in!

462
00:35:11,700 --> 00:35:13,900
That's great!

463
00:35:19,100 --> 00:35:22,060
Are you prepared to give yourself to me?

464
00:35:22,060 --> 00:35:23,399
What?

465
00:35:23,400 --> 00:35:24,300
Hi.

466
00:35:24,301 --> 00:35:26,799
Hello, I'm still here.

467
00:35:26,800 --> 00:35:28,433
There's someone here.

468
00:35:35,533 --> 00:35:40,399
Yes. We should really help you guys celebrate.

469
00:35:41,300 --> 00:35:43,600
Thank you, Brother Chigang!

470
00:35:48,000 --> 00:35:50,100
I'm still here.

471
00:35:54,700 --> 00:35:56,700
- Is that okay?
- Brother Jiawei.

472
00:35:56,700 --> 00:36:00,499
I see that your training is really paying off.

473
00:36:00,499 --> 00:36:01,999
Yeah!

474
00:36:02,000 --> 00:36:05,999
Also, let me tell you I've arranged your future classes for you already.

475
00:36:05,999 --> 00:36:08,299
Sun Bo, you're really professional.

476
00:36:08,300 --> 00:36:11,500
Don't say that. It's because you're dedicated.

477
00:36:11,500 --> 00:36:14,299
Besides, out of all the members here,

478
00:36:14,300 --> 00:36:17,299
I think that Brother Jiawei is the most focused.

479
00:36:17,300 --> 00:36:21,000
It's because my sales rep is always here to help me.

480
00:36:23,000 --> 00:36:25,100
Wake up!

481
00:36:26,500 --> 00:36:30,399
I see you continue to stare and stare, you're going to get sucked in.

482
00:36:30,399 --> 00:36:33,399
What are you staring at?

483
00:36:33,400 --> 00:36:35,299
You know...

484
00:36:35,300 --> 00:36:38,699
All of your thoughts are always in the gutter.

485
00:36:38,700 --> 00:36:40,832
It's you that made me think in the gutter.

486
00:36:40,833 --> 00:36:45,299
Just now, we didn't even finish the set and you've taken at least 100 looks that way. You know?

487
00:36:45,299 --> 00:36:46,599
You're over exaggerating.

488
00:36:46,600 --> 00:36:49,499
I'm just worried about how he did on his exams.

489
00:36:49,500 --> 00:36:51,832
Worried about how he did on exams?

490
00:36:51,833 --> 00:36:53,099
It's just that simple?

491
00:36:53,100 --> 00:36:55,000
Just that simple.

492
00:36:56,500 --> 00:37:00,800
Let me look into those evil eyes of yours.

493
00:37:00,800 --> 00:37:03,999
They're completely filled with lies.

494
00:37:04,000 --> 00:37:05,632
Sun Wenjie!

495
00:37:05,633 --> 00:37:07,999
Are you suspecting me of stealing your Brother Chigang again?

496
00:37:08,000 --> 00:37:10,832
I'm telling you, it's a complete misunderstanding.

497
00:37:10,833 --> 00:37:13,900
We're just worried about how you did on your exams, that's all.

498
00:37:15,200 --> 00:37:18,000
So that's why I keep saying that.

499
00:37:19,733 --> 00:37:20,932
Exactly.

500
00:37:20,933 --> 00:37:22,499
Did he do anything to you?

501
00:37:22,500 --> 00:37:25,799
I just said I didn't and you're still asking?

502
00:37:28,200 --> 00:37:30,533
So mean.

503
00:37:35,200 --> 00:37:38,299
Xiang Haoting got into National Central University.

504
00:37:38,300 --> 00:37:40,399
How about you?

505
00:37:40,400 --> 00:37:41,800
Me.

506
00:37:43,500 --> 00:37:46,499
My marks placed me at National Cheng Kung University.

507
00:37:46,500 --> 00:37:48,099
Cheng Kung University?

508
00:37:48,100 --> 00:37:49,999
That's very good.

509
00:37:50,000 --> 00:37:51,632
What's so good about it?

510
00:37:51,633 --> 00:37:54,732
I don't want it. It's so far.

511
00:37:54,732 --> 00:37:56,632
We just started seeing each other.

512
00:37:56,633 --> 00:37:59,499
I don't want to have a long-distance relationship with you.

513
00:37:59,500 --> 00:38:02,699
I've decided I'll help you complete your application.

514
00:38:02,700 --> 00:38:07,633
I don't want it. I don't want it!

515
00:38:07,633 --> 00:38:09,700
No room for discussion.

516
00:38:26,070 --> 00:38:30,710
[List of Universities]

517
00:38:35,300 --> 00:38:36,999
Be serious.

518
00:38:37,000 --> 00:38:39,099
Come look at what department you like better.

519
00:38:39,100 --> 00:38:41,000
Or what you are interested in.

520
00:38:42,300 --> 00:38:44,700
I'm only interested in you.

521
00:38:52,000 --> 00:38:55,100
I'm serious, I'll study whatever.

522
00:38:55,100 --> 00:39:00,499
I think the most important thing now is we need to find a place to live.

523
00:39:02,100 --> 00:39:03,999
We need to find a place to live?

524
00:39:04,000 --> 00:39:05,199
That's right.

525
00:39:05,200 --> 00:39:07,532
We're going out; of course, we need to live together.

526
00:39:07,533 --> 00:39:10,199
But you're in Chungli,

527
00:39:10,200 --> 00:39:11,699
I'm in Taipei.

528
00:39:11,700 --> 00:39:14,099
That's no problem.

529
00:39:14,100 --> 00:39:15,899
You're the priority!

530
00:39:15,900 --> 00:39:18,400
Then, you'll have to commute every day.

531
00:39:21,100 --> 00:39:23,033
But...

532
00:39:24,300 --> 00:39:25,899
Why are there so many buts?

533
00:39:25,900 --> 00:39:29,699
I've worked so long finally to achieve my goal to be with you.

534
00:39:30,500 --> 00:39:36,999
Of course, I want to be able to see you each and every day, right?

535
00:39:36,999 --> 00:39:37,933
Fine.

536
00:39:37,934 --> 00:39:40,200
Then, let's start to look for a place to live.

537
00:40:22,000 --> 00:40:24,300
I really want you.

538
00:40:33,800 --> 00:40:36,333
When will you give yourself to me?

539
00:40:50,300 --> 00:40:52,500
Let's look for a place to live.

540
00:41:00,000 --> 00:41:04,999
Is a condo better or an apartment?

541
00:41:10,933 --> 00:41:12,499
- How are you, Sir?
- Thank you.

542
00:41:12,499 --> 00:41:15,800
How are you, Miss? Can you take a look at this for me?

543
00:41:15,800 --> 00:41:18,800
- How are you? Please take a look, Sir.
- Please take a look. Thank you.

544
00:41:18,800 --> 00:41:21,200
- Sir, have you got one already?
- Thank you.

545
00:41:29,900 --> 00:41:32,099
He really agreed to go away with you?

546
00:41:32,100 --> 00:41:34,333
Miss, take a look. Thank you.

547
00:41:37,600 --> 00:41:39,100
Overnight.

548
00:41:40,900 --> 00:41:43,500
- No wonder you're working so hard.
- That's right.

549
00:41:43,500 --> 00:41:45,733
What? You're really going to go all out?

550
00:41:46,833 --> 00:41:48,700
What are you laughing for?

551
00:41:50,200 --> 00:41:52,299
Tell me!

552
00:41:52,300 --> 00:41:53,999
Just that the first time is very important.

553
00:41:54,000 --> 00:41:56,800
It has to be more perfect than perfect.

554
00:42:02,300 --> 00:42:04,133
My first time.

555
00:42:06,000 --> 00:42:07,632
I won't allow it.

556
00:42:07,633 --> 00:42:09,099
What?

557
00:42:09,100 --> 00:42:10,932
I want the same.

558
00:42:10,933 --> 00:42:12,600
What do you want?

559
00:42:14,533 --> 00:42:15,832
Hello?

560
00:42:15,833 --> 00:42:19,099
Sun Wenjie, I want a raise.

561
00:42:21,300 --> 00:42:23,100
All for love.

562
00:42:25,300 --> 00:42:26,999
I don't care!

563
00:42:27,000 --> 00:42:28,399
Make it happen!

564
00:42:28,400 --> 00:42:30,000
Bye-bye.

565
00:42:30,900 --> 00:42:33,999
Asking for a raise and you get the money right away?

566
00:42:34,000 --> 00:42:35,799
Of course.

567
00:42:35,800 --> 00:42:37,732
Late-night snacks on you then.

568
00:42:37,733 --> 00:42:39,800
This time I can't.

569
00:42:40,433 --> 00:42:42,099
Because I need to save up, too.

570
00:42:42,100 --> 00:42:43,899
I want to go all out, too.

571
00:42:43,900 --> 00:42:45,199
Selfish little kid!

572
00:42:45,200 --> 00:42:47,100
It's the first time.

573
00:42:48,900 --> 00:42:52,200
- How are you? Please take a look. Thank you.
- How are you? Miss, please take a look.

574
00:42:52,200 --> 00:42:53,800
Thank you.

575
00:42:55,400 --> 00:42:57,599
Don't put it on the bed.

576
00:42:57,600 --> 00:42:59,179
- Pick it up.
- Let me do it.

577
00:42:59,180 --> 00:43:01,733
You still have these rules now?

578
00:43:06,633 --> 00:43:08,899
It's too hot.

579
00:43:08,900 --> 00:43:10,199
What's the temperature today?

580
00:43:10,200 --> 00:43:12,100
Fan!

581
00:43:12,100 --> 00:43:15,199
I don't have a fan.

582
00:43:15,200 --> 00:43:16,880
Oh yeah.

583
00:43:17,700 --> 00:43:19,500
I forgot to buy one.

584
00:43:27,800 --> 00:43:30,100
You're so sticky.

585
00:43:32,300 --> 00:43:34,100
Get away.

586
00:43:34,100 --> 00:43:35,932
Don't you need to work?

587
00:43:35,933 --> 00:43:37,399
Go get ready.

588
00:43:37,400 --> 00:43:39,100
Hurry up.

589
00:43:57,300 --> 00:43:59,133
I'm dying from the heat.

590
00:44:00,900 --> 00:44:02,800
So sweet.

591
00:44:34,100 --> 00:44:35,999
You're really something.

592
00:44:36,000 --> 00:44:38,400
How can you sweat so much?

593
00:44:50,100 --> 00:44:51,900
Wipe yourself.

594
00:44:55,300 --> 00:44:58,000
Why did you put it on the floor?

595
00:44:58,000 --> 00:44:59,900
I can't?

596
00:45:04,400 --> 00:45:07,199
What? You want to eat some?

597
00:45:23,801 --> 00:45:25,533
That tickles.

598
00:45:27,400 --> 00:45:29,400
What do you want?

599
00:45:38,180 --> 00:45:43,700
♫ I still don’t understand why you left ♫

600
00:45:43,700 --> 00:45:49,760
♫ I still don’t understand why I’m waiting ♫

601
00:45:49,760 --> 00:45:55,460
♫ Waiting for who will remember their responsibility ♫

602
00:45:55,460 --> 00:46:01,230
♫ I’m left at the original place wandering around alone ♫

603
00:46:01,230 --> 00:46:06,530
♫ When the blue sky and white clouds disappear ♫

604
00:46:06,530 --> 00:46:11,980
♫ When you take away the yellow sneakers and the red sweater ♫

605
00:46:11,980 --> 00:46:17,270
♫ When all the colors are gone along with you ♫

606
00:46:17,270 --> 00:46:24,080
♫ Only transparent tears that unceasingly fall accompany me ♫

607
00:46:24,080 --> 00:46:29,530
♫ I still don’t understand why you left ♫

608
00:46:29,530 --> 00:46:35,490
♫ I still don’t understand why I’m waiting ♫

609
00:46:35,490 --> 00:46:41,330
♫ Waiting for who will remember their responsibility ♫

610
00:46:41,330 --> 00:46:45,620
♫ I’m left at the original place wandering around alone ♫

611
00:46:45,620 --> 00:46:51,040
♫ When one story becomes two regrets ♫

612
00:46:51,040 --> 00:46:57,250
♫ Letting two hearts run towards two different futures ♫

613
00:46:57,250 --> 00:47:02,840
♫ All those that can’t be forgotten can only become regrets ♫

614
00:47:02,840 --> 00:47:09,810
♫ But I still can’t understand why the tears won’t stop ♫
