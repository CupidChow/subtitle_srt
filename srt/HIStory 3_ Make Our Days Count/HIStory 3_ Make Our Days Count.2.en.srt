[HIStory 3: Make Our Days Count]
[Episode 2]

13
00:01:30,083 --> 00:01:31,883
What do you guys want anyway?

14
00:01:31,884 --> 00:01:33,116
Stop hassling me.

15
00:01:37,650 --> 00:01:39,215
What do you mean it's none of my business?

16
00:01:39,216 --> 00:01:42,115
Anything to do with Brother Chigang is something to do with me.

17
00:01:42,116 --> 00:01:44,416
Do you also like Brother Chigang?

18
00:01:44,417 --> 00:01:45,417
Let go!

19
00:01:45,418 --> 00:01:46,482
He's mine.

20
00:01:46,483 --> 00:01:47,783
No one can interfere or sabotage me!

21
00:01:47,784 --> 00:01:50,049
I don't understand what you're talking about...

22
00:01:50,050 --> 00:01:51,449
Sun Boxiang, what are you doing?

23
00:01:51,450 --> 00:01:53,550
Bothering another student?

24
00:01:59,884 --> 00:02:01,549
Student, are you okay?

25
00:02:01,550 --> 00:02:02,417
I'm fine.

26
00:02:02,418 --> 00:02:04,949
If anything's wrong, remember to tell teacher.

27
00:02:04,950 --> 00:02:06,383
Thank you, Teacher.

28
00:02:10,283 --> 00:02:12,349
Did he provoke a group that he shouldn't have?

29
00:02:12,350 --> 00:02:14,083
Look at it now.

30
00:02:24,980 --> 00:02:27,249
Xiang Haoting said you stood him up,

31
00:02:27,250 --> 00:02:29,149
so he kidnapped your desk and chair.

32
00:02:29,150 --> 00:02:31,070
He wants you to meet him in the engineering building.

33
00:02:33,150 --> 00:02:34,883
Can you return my desk and chair?

34
00:02:34,884 --> 00:02:35,684
Apologize.

35
00:02:35,685 --> 00:02:37,316
Why do I need to apologize?

36
00:02:37,317 --> 00:02:38,549
You didn't show up yesterday.

37
00:02:38,550 --> 00:02:39,916
I never agreed to show up.

38
00:02:39,917 --> 00:02:42,749
You got my brothers into trouble and they've been punished to sweep the schoolyard.

39
00:02:42,750 --> 00:02:44,582
That's because they hit me.

40
00:02:44,583 --> 00:02:45,950
They hit you because you were stealing my girlfriend.

41
00:02:45,951 --> 00:02:47,317
I'm not stealing your girlfriend.

42
00:02:52,050 --> 00:02:54,090
She sat down and asked me to tutor her with homework.

43
00:02:57,050 --> 00:02:58,249
She said she didn't bring a jacket

44
00:02:58,250 --> 00:02:59,010
and it was cold.

45
00:02:59,010 --> 00:03:00,010
Are you a man?

46
00:03:00,011 --> 00:03:01,417
Blaming the girl for everything?

47
00:03:03,484 --> 00:03:05,749
A bookworm like you...

48
00:03:05,750 --> 00:03:08,083
Do you think the world revolves around you?

49
00:03:09,050 --> 00:03:10,783
I don't like her.

50
00:03:10,784 --> 00:03:12,082
Then, why do you keep getting close to her?

51
00:03:12,083 --> 00:03:13,516
I told you I'm not trying to get close to her!

52
00:03:13,517 --> 00:03:15,884
All you can say is "I didn't," do you know how to say anything else?

53
00:03:18,250 --> 00:03:20,082
I'm just asking for a simple apology, is that so hard?

54
00:03:20,083 --> 00:03:21,482
I didn't do anything wrong, why should I apologize?

55
00:03:21,483 --> 00:03:22,649
Say it again.

56
00:03:22,650 --> 00:03:24,979
I didn't do anything wrong so I will never apologize!

57
00:03:24,980 --> 00:03:26,082
Xiang Haoting!

58
00:03:26,083 --> 00:03:27,980
Let go!

59
00:03:28,980 --> 00:03:30,009
If you don't let go,

60
00:03:30,010 --> 00:03:31,750
I'll ask your parents to come to school!

61
00:03:35,917 --> 00:03:36,850
Okay, okay.

62
00:03:36,851 --> 00:03:39,115
You get back to class right now!

63
00:03:39,116 --> 00:03:40,050
You...

64
00:03:40,051 --> 00:03:42,150
Come with me to the instructor's office!

65
00:03:55,850 --> 00:03:57,649
Yu Shigu!

66
00:03:57,650 --> 00:04:00,082
Are you okay? Did he hurt you?

67
00:04:00,083 --> 00:04:01,149
You're the one that asked the school instructor to come?

68
00:04:01,150 --> 00:04:02,010
Of course.

69
00:04:02,011 --> 00:04:04,011
Because when Xiang Haoting gets angry, he's scary.

70
00:04:05,817 --> 00:04:07,282
Stop meddling in my business.

71
00:04:07,283 --> 00:04:08,516
I don't want to be wrongly accused of anything anymore.

72
00:04:08,517 --> 00:04:10,215
You don't need to worry.

73
00:04:10,216 --> 00:04:11,979
I already planned on breaking up with Xiang Haoting.

74
00:04:11,980 --> 00:04:13,649
I don't like you getting so close to me.

75
00:04:13,650 --> 00:04:15,784
Please stay far away from me.

76
00:04:22,583 --> 00:04:24,583
Who likes you?

77
00:04:38,150 --> 00:04:39,215
That's enough.

78
00:04:39,216 --> 00:04:40,383
Get up.

79
00:04:42,850 --> 00:04:44,750
There are still 32 minutes left.

80
00:04:47,517 --> 00:04:48,050
You--

81
00:04:48,051 --> 00:04:51,182
You really are stubborn!

82
00:04:51,183 --> 00:04:52,616
Don't blame your father for making you kneel.

83
00:04:52,617 --> 00:04:54,482
This time, it really was your fault.

84
00:04:54,483 --> 00:04:57,009
You promised us that you would never beat up anyone again.

85
00:04:57,010 --> 00:04:58,182
I remember!

86
00:04:58,183 --> 00:04:59,483
So I only pushed and pulled him a little.

87
00:04:59,484 --> 00:05:01,149
I didn't do anything else.

88
00:05:01,150 --> 00:05:03,215
You're still so young.

89
00:05:03,216 --> 00:05:03,784
Just a student... What's the need to make this into such a big deal?

90
00:05:03,785 --> 00:05:06,049
Just a student... What's the need to make this into such a big deal?

91
00:05:06,050 --> 00:05:07,115
Besides, you're a big kid!

92
00:05:07,116 --> 00:05:09,349
You lifted the other person up. If he got injured, then what would you do?

93
00:05:09,350 --> 00:05:10,216
Promise me!

94
00:05:10,217 --> 00:05:11,249
Never again!

95
00:05:11,250 --> 00:05:12,083
Mommy, this is a matter of principle.

96
00:05:12,084 --> 00:05:13,817
Mommy, this is a matter of principle.

97
00:05:14,550 --> 00:05:17,115
So what if he's the valedictorian.

98
00:05:17,116 --> 00:05:18,083
No sense of honor at all.

99
00:05:18,084 --> 00:05:20,215
Blames the girl for everything!

100
00:05:20,216 --> 00:05:21,183
And also likes to snitch! I despise these types of people.

101
00:05:21,184 --> 00:05:22,884
And also likes to snitch! I despise these types of people.

102
00:05:25,116 --> 00:05:26,649
That's easy then.

103
00:05:26,650 --> 00:05:27,849
You go and get the top mark on the next exam

104
00:05:27,850 --> 00:05:29,450
and make him angry.

105
00:05:34,383 --> 00:05:36,349
Reverse psychology doesn't work on me.

106
00:05:36,350 --> 00:05:38,684
I will find some other way to make him angry.

107
00:05:40,483 --> 00:05:41,783
I really don't understand.

108
00:05:41,784 --> 00:05:42,617
You--

109
00:05:42,618 --> 00:05:46,009
What's the point of moving someone's desk and chair?

110
00:05:46,010 --> 00:05:46,980
The instructor told you to move it back. Do you hear me?

111
00:05:46,981 --> 00:05:48,884
The instructor told you to move it back. Do you hear me?

112
00:05:51,517 --> 00:05:53,517
You're really not getting up?

113
00:05:55,617 --> 00:05:57,917
I really don't know what to do with you!

114
00:06:14,517 --> 00:06:16,784
- Bye-bye.
- Bye-bye.

115
00:06:24,517 --> 00:06:26,784
- Bye-bye.
- Bye-bye.

116
00:07:02,116 --> 00:07:03,784
You're mopping the place yourself?

117
00:07:31,450 --> 00:07:33,049
Are you hungry?

118
00:07:33,050 --> 00:07:34,950
Do you want to grab something to eat?

119
00:07:41,250 --> 00:07:43,716
I've noticed that your training's improving lately.

120
00:07:43,717 --> 00:07:45,383
How about if we…

121
00:07:50,483 --> 00:07:52,382
We've known each other so long now.

122
00:07:52,383 --> 00:07:53,683
Do you want to... go catch a movie with me?

123
00:07:53,684 --> 00:07:55,650
Do you want to... go catch a movie with me?

124
00:08:15,550 --> 00:08:17,250
Brother Chigang!

125
00:08:23,250 --> 00:08:25,116
Don't be like that, okay?

126
00:09:22,267 --> 00:09:25,165
Waiting is so boring!

127
00:09:25,166 --> 00:09:27,634
Why did Old Sun take a leave of absence?

128
00:09:28,930 --> 00:09:30,399
No need to wait.

129
00:09:30,400 --> 00:09:31,867
I'm starving.

130
00:09:34,083 --> 00:09:35,584
You're provoking us!

131
00:09:36,617 --> 00:09:38,016
Are you my brother or not?

132
00:09:39,083 --> 00:09:39,717
I'm here.

133
00:09:39,718 --> 00:09:41,550
You're finally here!

134
00:09:42,417 --> 00:09:44,382
I got your favorite.

135
00:09:44,383 --> 00:09:45,879
You know me best.

136
00:09:45,880 --> 00:09:47,417
Awesome.

137
00:09:49,750 --> 00:09:51,217
Yours.

138
00:09:52,317 --> 00:09:53,016
Thanks.

139
00:09:53,017 --> 00:09:54,049
A-hao, why did you return his desk and chair?

140
00:09:54,050 --> 00:09:56,050
A-hao, why did you return his desk and chair?

141
00:09:57,450 --> 00:09:59,182
Don't bring it up.

142
00:09:59,183 --> 00:10:01,282
We can't just let this go.

143
00:10:01,283 --> 00:10:03,149
Why keep hassling him?

144
00:10:03,150 --> 00:10:04,382
Don't you feel that he's pretty self arrogant and really needs a good beating?

145
00:10:04,383 --> 00:10:06,316
Don't you feel that he's pretty self arrogant and really needs a good beating?

146
00:10:06,317 --> 00:10:08,282
Don't forget what happened in the first year.

147
00:10:08,283 --> 00:10:09,616
His eyes were way up on his forehead.

148
00:10:09,617 --> 00:10:11,249
That arrogance.

149
00:10:11,250 --> 00:10:13,417
All day, he would be with that Zhuang person.

150
00:10:14,417 --> 00:10:15,116
Forget it.

151
00:10:15,117 --> 00:10:17,015
Bookworms like to be with their same kind.

152
00:10:17,016 --> 00:10:18,449
They look down on us.

153
00:10:18,450 --> 00:10:19,716
Why say that?

154
00:10:19,717 --> 00:10:20,909
He just studies harder and cares about his grades.

155
00:10:20,910 --> 00:10:22,182
He just studies harder and cares about his grades.

156
00:10:22,183 --> 00:10:23,616
Not like us.

157
00:10:23,617 --> 00:10:25,683
Why do you keep sticking up for that Gu guy?

158
00:10:25,684 --> 00:10:27,317
I can't stand him.

159
00:10:28,450 --> 00:10:30,015
Forget it.

160
00:10:30,016 --> 00:10:32,083
I'll handle the bookworm.

161
00:10:32,910 --> 00:10:34,015
What are you going to do?

162
00:10:34,016 --> 00:10:35,349
Take care of him?

163
00:10:35,350 --> 00:10:36,183
Me too.

164
00:10:36,184 --> 00:10:38,880
I must find a way to piss him off.

165
00:10:40,350 --> 00:10:41,683
Hey, don't joke around.

166
00:10:41,684 --> 00:10:43,249
We're in the third year.

167
00:10:43,250 --> 00:10:45,717
We need to think about what we should do after graduation

168
00:10:48,617 --> 00:10:49,483
A-hao, what would you like to do after graduating?

169
00:10:49,484 --> 00:10:51,164
A-hao, what would you like to do after graduating?

170
00:10:53,116 --> 00:10:54,016
Are you asking me?

171
00:10:54,017 --> 00:10:55,282
Look at him being so cocky.

172
00:10:55,283 --> 00:10:56,183
I know! Be in the mob.

173
00:10:56,184 --> 00:10:57,879
I know! Be in the mob.

174
00:10:57,880 --> 00:10:59,449
You're going to be in the mob. I have my own plans.

175
00:10:59,450 --> 00:11:00,879
You're going to be in the mob. I have my own plans.

176
00:11:00,880 --> 00:11:02,879
You're not going to try to get into university?

177
00:11:02,880 --> 00:11:04,849
Is university mandatory?

178
00:11:04,850 --> 00:11:06,182
Guess not.

179
00:11:06,183 --> 00:11:07,950
Sounds reasonable.

180
00:11:10,784 --> 00:11:12,249
You have the guts to tell your mom and dad?

181
00:11:12,250 --> 00:11:13,749
Of course, I have the guts to do so, why wouldn't I?

182
00:11:13,750 --> 00:11:15,183
I don't have the guts.

183
00:11:16,450 --> 00:11:18,049
Wimp!

184
00:11:18,050 --> 00:11:19,416
Just eat.

185
00:11:19,417 --> 00:11:21,015
He'll be okay!

186
00:11:21,016 --> 00:11:23,316
His parents, teachers, girlfriend: he doesn't need to care.

187
00:11:23,317 --> 00:11:24,516
His parents, teachers, girlfriend: he doesn't need to care.

188
00:11:24,517 --> 00:11:25,849
He's not worried.

189
00:11:25,850 --> 00:11:28,449
His worry (care) factor is zero.

190
00:11:28,450 --> 00:11:29,583
That's true.

191
00:11:29,584 --> 00:11:31,317
Could you be like him?

192
00:11:31,983 --> 00:11:33,784
I'll just eat

193
00:11:44,650 --> 00:11:45,749
Let me see!

194
00:11:45,750 --> 00:11:46,750
I don't believe you!

195
00:11:46,751 --> 00:11:48,583
I'm serious!

196
00:11:48,584 --> 00:11:50,880
You're the one that made everything up!

197
00:11:53,717 --> 00:11:55,116
Hi!

198
00:12:01,350 --> 00:12:02,417
Bye.

199
00:12:03,483 --> 00:12:05,083
Going back to class.

200
00:12:15,850 --> 00:12:16,650
Baby, you haven't returned any of my messages.

201
00:12:16,651 --> 00:12:18,216
Baby, you haven't returned any of my messages.

202
00:12:18,217 --> 00:12:20,417
You're still mad at me?

203
00:12:21,910 --> 00:12:23,382
No.

204
00:12:23,383 --> 00:12:25,717
You're clearly still mad.

205
00:12:26,684 --> 00:12:28,750
Didn't you say you like Yu Shigu?

206
00:12:29,983 --> 00:12:33,482
Are you serious or just pretending?

207
00:12:33,483 --> 00:12:36,449
I said that only to make you angry.

208
00:12:36,450 --> 00:12:39,483
Because you haven't even bothered to talk to me for so long.

209
00:12:48,317 --> 00:12:50,316
I'm sorry.

210
00:12:50,317 --> 00:12:52,183
I like you.

211
00:12:58,183 --> 00:13:00,009
Going forward... I won't have much time to spend on you, either.

212
00:13:00,010 --> 00:13:01,917
Going forward... I won't have much time to spend on you, either.

213
00:13:02,917 --> 00:13:04,582
That's okay.

214
00:13:04,583 --> 00:13:06,783
We can concentrate on preparing for the midterm exams.

215
00:13:06,784 --> 00:13:08,516
But after our exams, let's plan a trip together. Okay?

216
00:13:08,517 --> 00:13:10,817
But after our exams, let's plan a trip together. Okay?

217
00:13:16,980 --> 00:13:19,049
I'm really sorry.

218
00:13:19,050 --> 00:13:21,316
Baby, kiss-kiss.

219
00:13:21,317 --> 00:13:23,317
Let's make up, kiss-kiss.

220
00:13:27,917 --> 00:13:29,917
You!

221
00:13:41,900 --> 00:13:43,399
They're really spontaneous.

222
00:13:43,400 --> 00:13:45,466
Start kissing just like that.

223
00:13:45,467 --> 00:13:47,033
You really want to, too.

224
00:14:04,166 --> 00:14:05,733
What is it?

225
00:14:05,734 --> 00:14:07,667
Can you buy me some soymilk?

226
00:14:08,667 --> 00:14:09,959
What the hell's your problem? Asking me to come all this way just to buy you a cup of soymilk.

227
00:14:09,960 --> 00:14:13,299
What the hell's your problem? Asking me to come all this way just to buy you a cup of soymilk.

228
00:14:13,300 --> 00:14:15,467
And then tell him sorry for me, I know I was wrong.

229
00:14:15,467 --> 00:14:17,033
I didn't do it on purpose, can he forgive me?

230
00:14:17,034 --> 00:14:18,499
And then can we be like we were before? Everything was okay--

231
00:14:18,500 --> 00:14:19,467
And then can we be like we were before? Everything was okay--

232
00:14:19,468 --> 00:14:20,734
Wait!

233
00:14:25,333 --> 00:14:27,132
So you want me to be your sorry bag now to help you apologize to the girl you like?

234
00:14:27,133 --> 00:14:29,266
So you want me to be your sorry bag now to help you apologize to the girl you like?

235
00:14:29,267 --> 00:14:30,766
No!

236
00:14:30,767 --> 00:14:32,133
Then, what is it?

237
00:14:40,367 --> 00:14:42,100
It's a guy.

238
00:14:49,533 --> 00:14:50,733
You're joking!

239
00:14:50,734 --> 00:14:52,432
You're the manly man! Tell me.

240
00:14:52,433 --> 00:14:53,867
What are you really doing?

241
00:14:55,066 --> 00:14:55,867
Why are you getting so pissed off? What are you mad about?

242
00:14:55,868 --> 00:14:56,899
Why are you getting so pissed off? What are you mad about?

243
00:14:56,900 --> 00:14:59,999
I really do like him!

244
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:02,233
Really, really, really like!

245
00:15:10,734 --> 00:15:12,834
So you're being for real?

246
00:15:18,960 --> 00:15:21,099
I thought you...

247
00:15:21,100 --> 00:15:25,467
I thought you went to the gym to see those--

248
00:15:32,634 --> 00:15:34,100
I got you, Brother!

249
00:15:35,267 --> 00:15:36,466
Which one?

250
00:15:36,467 --> 00:15:38,165
The one on the left or the one on the right?

251
00:15:38,166 --> 00:15:40,333
The one inside.

252
00:15:41,400 --> 00:15:43,799
The one inside.

253
00:15:43,800 --> 00:15:45,432
The one inside is kind of old.

254
00:15:45,433 --> 00:15:46,930
Are you going to help or not?

255
00:15:48,600 --> 00:15:50,799
Brother, it's not that I don't want to help you.

256
00:15:50,800 --> 00:15:51,433
If you want to apologize, you need to do it yourself for it to be sincere.

257
00:15:51,434 --> 00:15:53,733
If you want to apologize, you need to do it yourself for it to be sincere.

258
00:15:53,734 --> 00:15:55,233
Asking someone else to apologize for you is totally insincere. Why would anyone forgive you?

259
00:15:55,234 --> 00:15:58,032
Asking someone else to apologize for you is totally insincere. Why would anyone forgive you?

260
00:15:58,033 --> 00:15:59,599
I'm afraid he won't listen to me.

261
00:15:59,600 --> 00:16:00,999
Scared?

262
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:01,930
Everyone is scared! That's why you need to go and do it!

263
00:16:01,930 --> 00:16:03,930
Everyone is scared! That's why you need to go and do it!

264
00:16:04,734 --> 00:16:06,999
To show you're determined.

265
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:08,666
Understand?

266
00:16:08,667 --> 00:16:10,232
Did you bring your little mushroom?

267
00:16:10,233 --> 00:16:10,867
Yup.

268
00:16:10,868 --> 00:16:12,500
Then go!

269
00:16:14,400 --> 00:16:16,099
You can do it.

270
00:16:16,100 --> 00:16:17,930
I'll wait for you here.

271
00:16:20,734 --> 00:16:22,900
Go!

272
00:16:33,930 --> 00:16:35,433
Welcome.

273
00:16:36,433 --> 00:16:38,099
I'm not here to apologize!

274
00:16:38,100 --> 00:16:39,066
It's not wrong to like you!

275
00:16:39,066 --> 00:16:39,960
You...

276
00:16:39,960 --> 00:16:40,800
Keep it down.

277
00:16:40,801 --> 00:16:42,266
I don't want to be quiet!

278
00:16:42,267 --> 00:16:43,033
Lu Chigang, I like you!

279
00:16:43,034 --> 00:16:44,132
Lu Chigang, I like you!

280
00:16:44,133 --> 00:16:46,165
Also, I don't regret what happened in the bathroom--

281
00:16:46,166 --> 00:16:47,699
Can you act more mature?

282
00:16:47,700 --> 00:16:49,633
This is my work place.

283
00:16:49,634 --> 00:16:51,833
Do you know what you're doing?

284
00:16:51,834 --> 00:16:53,734
Why come here to make trouble?

285
00:16:57,700 --> 00:17:00,500
Did you think about what your actions would result in?

286
00:17:01,800 --> 00:17:02,899
First, it was the gym. Now, at my place of work.

287
00:17:02,900 --> 00:17:05,133
First, it was the gym. Now, at my place of work.

288
00:17:06,400 --> 00:17:07,867
I'm sorry.

289
00:17:10,233 --> 00:17:11,699
Let me tell you one more time.

290
00:17:11,700 --> 00:17:13,599
Please don't come to make trouble anymore.

291
00:17:13,600 --> 00:17:15,433
Okay?

292
00:17:59,367 --> 00:18:00,666
Student Yu Shigu, you really did very well this time.

293
00:18:00,667 --> 00:18:02,532
Student Yu Shigu, you really did very well this time.

294
00:18:02,533 --> 00:18:04,532
Teacher is very happy.

295
00:18:04,533 --> 00:18:06,299
And here is an exam.

296
00:18:06,300 --> 00:18:07,766
Take it home and work on it.

297
00:18:07,767 --> 00:18:10,199
This summer if you're not too busy, practice more.

298
00:18:10,200 --> 00:18:13,267
Because I believe that these questions will benefit you a lot.

299
00:18:14,300 --> 00:18:17,199
What's the zodiac sign of people born on this day?

300
00:18:17,200 --> 00:18:19,032
Raise your hand if you know the answer.

301
00:18:19,033 --> 00:18:19,900
Okay, please speak.

302
00:18:19,900 --> 00:18:20,433
Pisces.

303
00:18:20,433 --> 00:18:21,233
That's right.

304
00:18:21,234 --> 00:18:22,633
Here, next question.

305
00:18:22,634 --> 00:18:24,432
People born on the day of Summer Solstice are what zodiac sign?

306
00:18:24,433 --> 00:18:26,366
People born on the day of Summer Solstice are what zodiac sign?

307
00:18:26,367 --> 00:18:27,133
Here.

308
00:18:27,133 --> 00:18:27,533
You.

309
00:18:27,533 --> 00:18:28,533
Please reply.

310
00:18:57,367 --> 00:18:58,333
Carry me a little, quick!

311
00:18:58,334 --> 00:18:59,999
Carry me.

312
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:01,032
Didn't I carry you?

313
00:19:01,033 --> 00:19:03,033
I'm out of blood, quick!

314
00:19:04,167 --> 00:19:05,432
Lost again.

315
00:19:05,433 --> 00:19:06,499
You're the worst.

316
00:19:06,500 --> 00:19:08,733
These types of days, when will they end?

317
00:19:08,734 --> 00:19:11,766
That's right. Every day it's exam, exam, exam.

318
00:19:11,767 --> 00:19:13,433
I really can't stand it anymore.

319
00:19:14,300 --> 00:19:15,966
Exams are good.

320
00:19:17,033 --> 00:19:19,432
Concentrate on exams.

321
00:19:19,433 --> 00:19:22,032
Then, you'll have no time to think about anything else.

322
00:19:22,033 --> 00:19:23,829
Old Sun, you didn't do so well on the exam.

323
00:19:23,830 --> 00:19:25,267
Old Sun, you didn't do so well on the exam.

324
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:26,830
Yeah.

325
00:19:26,831 --> 00:19:29,032
Lately, you've been acting kind of strange.

326
00:19:29,033 --> 00:19:30,899
Speak.

327
00:19:30,900 --> 00:19:32,032
That's enough.

328
00:19:32,033 --> 00:19:33,899
Don't bother him.

329
00:19:33,900 --> 00:19:35,399
This is us caring for him.

330
00:19:35,400 --> 00:19:36,634
That's right!

331
00:19:41,200 --> 00:19:43,166
You're all the same.

332
00:19:43,167 --> 00:19:44,033
Why is school not over?

333
00:19:44,034 --> 00:19:45,700
I really want to play basketball.

334
00:19:47,066 --> 00:19:48,965
Midterm exams are tomorrow.

335
00:19:48,966 --> 00:19:50,633
Xia De, didn't you prepare the exam questions?

336
00:19:50,634 --> 00:19:51,699
Weren't we going to get together and go over them?

337
00:19:51,700 --> 00:19:52,433
- No.
- No way!

338
00:19:52,434 --> 00:19:53,599
- No.
- No way!

339
00:19:53,600 --> 00:19:56,666
Then I'm going to take off, I won't hang out with you guys after school.

340
00:19:56,667 --> 00:19:58,830
I have something way more important to do.

341
00:20:00,333 --> 00:20:01,965
Are you going to Chambers?

342
00:20:01,966 --> 00:20:03,232
Why don't you take us with you?

343
00:20:03,233 --> 00:20:04,433
That's right, together.

344
00:20:06,066 --> 00:20:07,633
You'll find out soon.

345
00:20:07,634 --> 00:20:08,600
Here we go again.

346
00:20:08,601 --> 00:20:10,300
I'm going to get something to drink.

347
00:20:12,500 --> 00:20:14,566
Being mysterious again.

348
00:20:14,567 --> 00:20:16,133
Always keeps us in the dark.

349
00:20:18,167 --> 00:20:20,634
Yu Shigu, this is for you.

350
00:20:22,667 --> 00:20:24,634
No need, thanks.

351
00:20:26,400 --> 00:20:27,633
Isn't that Xiang Haoting?

352
00:20:27,634 --> 00:20:28,400
That's right.

353
00:20:28,401 --> 00:20:30,333
Is it really him?

354
00:20:35,167 --> 00:20:36,266
It's really him.

355
00:20:36,267 --> 00:20:37,599
So handsome.

356
00:20:37,600 --> 00:20:38,989
A-hao!

357
00:20:38,990 --> 00:20:40,900
De!

358
00:20:53,367 --> 00:20:54,666
Senior!

359
00:20:54,667 --> 00:20:56,432
Last time the school editorial didn't get a chance to interview you. We really--

360
00:20:56,433 --> 00:20:56,900
Last time the school editorial didn't get a chance to interview you. We really--

361
00:20:56,901 --> 00:20:58,232
Don't have time!

362
00:20:58,233 --> 00:20:59,299
Please, Senior, please. Just give us a little bit of time.

363
00:20:59,300 --> 00:21:01,699
Please, Senior, please. Just give us a little bit of time.

364
00:21:01,700 --> 00:21:03,766
Then, how about if we add your LINE.

365
00:21:03,767 --> 00:21:04,932
Add your LINE.

366
00:21:04,933 --> 00:21:06,065
Can we get your LINE account? Senior, add our LINE, please!

367
00:21:06,066 --> 00:21:07,466
Can we get your LINE account? Senior, add our LINE, please!

368
00:21:07,467 --> 00:21:09,300
Add LINE!

369
00:21:10,500 --> 00:21:11,999
Thank you, Senior!

370
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:13,333
This is great!

371
00:21:29,567 --> 00:21:32,500
It's so late, what are you doing still in the classroom?

372
00:21:38,400 --> 00:21:40,766
I'm starving.

373
00:21:40,767 --> 00:21:42,830
You don't need to eat?

374
00:21:55,200 --> 00:21:56,534
No way.

375
00:21:58,600 --> 00:22:00,299
Student Yu, it's about time.

376
00:22:00,300 --> 00:22:01,300
Okay.

377
00:22:01,301 --> 00:22:02,566
Be careful on your way home. Remember to turn off the lights and close the door.

378
00:22:02,567 --> 00:22:04,432
Be careful on your way home. Remember to turn off the lights and close the door.

379
00:22:04,433 --> 00:22:05,400
Thank you, Brother Lin.

380
00:22:05,401 --> 00:22:06,830
- Bye-bye.
- Bye-bye.

381
00:22:49,700 --> 00:22:50,859
How long do we need to walk? Why not take the bus when it's available?

382
00:22:50,860 --> 00:22:52,734
How long do we need to walk? Why not take the bus when it's available?

383
00:22:54,167 --> 00:22:55,667
Weird.

384
00:23:13,066 --> 00:23:15,100
I got you

385
00:25:05,300 --> 00:25:06,900
I'm leaving!

386
00:25:11,066 --> 00:25:12,900
No way!

387
00:25:18,600 --> 00:25:20,100
Who's there?

388
00:25:21,133 --> 00:25:21,767
Hello.

389
00:25:21,768 --> 00:25:23,233
Xiang Haoting>

390
00:25:23,900 --> 00:25:24,500
Don't be a bother now. It's midterm exams today!

391
00:25:24,501 --> 00:25:25,899
Don't be a bother now. It's midterm exams today!

392
00:25:25,900 --> 00:25:26,700
I know.

393
00:25:26,701 --> 00:25:28,634
That's why I picked today.

394
00:25:31,700 --> 00:25:33,534
Xiang Haoting, what do you want?

395
00:25:43,830 --> 00:25:45,166
You want me to apologize, is that it?

396
00:25:45,167 --> 00:25:46,799
I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

397
00:25:46,800 --> 00:25:48,400
Is that okay?

398
00:25:53,066 --> 00:25:54,399
Get out of the way.

399
00:25:54,400 --> 00:25:55,700
I want to go out!

400
00:26:23,033 --> 00:26:24,534
Move!

401
00:26:33,830 --> 00:26:34,734
What the heck are you doing?

402
00:26:34,735 --> 00:26:36,400
Don't hassle me!

403
00:27:07,500 --> 00:27:09,267
Why are you sleeping?

404
00:27:10,300 --> 00:27:11,499
Reporting!

405
00:27:11,500 --> 00:27:12,533
Teacher, I'm sorry I'm late!

406
00:27:12,534 --> 00:27:13,933
I will go take the exam right now!

407
00:27:15,233 --> 00:27:16,432
Student Yu, it's already too late.

408
00:27:16,433 --> 00:27:18,099
Student Yu, it's already too late.

409
00:27:18,100 --> 00:27:19,299
You will need to wait for the make-up exam.

410
00:27:19,300 --> 00:27:20,859
Teacher, in these three years I've only been late once.

411
00:27:20,860 --> 00:27:23,132
I'm begging you, please let me take the exam.

412
00:27:23,133 --> 00:27:24,667
What are you doing?

413
00:27:26,300 --> 00:27:28,066
Teacher, I beg you!

414
00:27:30,133 --> 00:27:31,533
Don't bother the students.

415
00:27:31,534 --> 00:27:33,300
Come outside with me.

416
00:27:34,667 --> 00:27:36,267
Xiang Haoting, what are you doing here?

417
00:27:37,700 --> 00:27:38,999
You can see me?

418
00:27:39,000 --> 00:27:40,699
What are you talking about?

419
00:27:40,700 --> 00:27:41,700
Teacher, please!

420
00:27:41,700 --> 00:27:42,333
Please.

421
00:27:42,334 --> 00:27:43,533
I only need three minutes.

422
00:27:43,534 --> 00:27:44,932
I'll be done in three minutes.

423
00:27:44,933 --> 00:27:45,860
The rules are rules.

424
00:27:45,861 --> 00:27:47,032
Begging me will be of no use!

425
00:27:47,033 --> 00:27:48,132
That's right.

426
00:27:48,133 --> 00:27:49,199
If you don't stop, I'll call for the school instructor.

427
00:27:49,200 --> 00:27:51,133
If you don't stop, I'll call for the school instructor.

428
00:27:55,767 --> 00:27:56,467
Teacher, I'm begging you!

429
00:27:56,468 --> 00:27:57,499
Yu Shigu, get up.

430
00:27:57,500 --> 00:27:58,300
Please.

431
00:27:58,300 --> 00:27:59,200
Teacher, please.

432
00:27:59,200 --> 00:28:00,033
You, get up!

433
00:28:00,033 --> 00:28:00,667
If you do that, I--

434
00:28:00,668 --> 00:28:02,299
I won't get up unless you agree!

435
00:28:02,300 --> 00:28:03,999
I can't agree!

436
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:06,366
You're really too much!

437
00:28:06,367 --> 00:28:08,266
Everyone's watching!

438
00:28:08,267 --> 00:28:10,233
Is this really necessary?

439
00:28:55,267 --> 00:28:57,600
Auntie!

440
00:28:58,767 --> 00:28:59,859
Shi-shi, starting today, you'll be living with me.

441
00:28:59,860 --> 00:29:02,900
Shi-shi, starting today, you'll be living with me.

442
00:29:03,567 --> 00:29:06,232
Okay, then how many days will I live with you?

443
00:29:06,233 --> 00:29:07,766
For a very very long time, because Mom and Dad

444
00:29:07,767 --> 00:29:10,332
For a very very long time, because Mom and Dad

445
00:29:10,333 --> 00:29:13,199
went on an exploration with the stars.

446
00:29:13,200 --> 00:29:15,860
What's wrong, Auntie?

447
00:29:22,567 --> 00:29:23,534
Auntie, then is a very, very long time, one month?

448
00:29:23,535 --> 00:29:26,467
Auntie, then is a very, very long time, one month?

449
00:29:28,300 --> 00:29:31,300
When will they come to pick me up?

450
00:29:55,734 --> 00:29:58,467
Can the rain stop just for a while?

451
00:29:59,667 --> 00:30:01,830
I miss you guys so much.

452
00:30:19,567 --> 00:30:21,333
Hi, is anyone home?

453
00:30:22,050 --> 00:30:24,015
How did you come up with that one?

454
00:30:24,016 --> 00:30:25,249
That was a really good one he pulled.

455
00:30:25,250 --> 00:30:26,583
It was awesome!

456
00:30:26,584 --> 00:30:28,049
Bang!

457
00:30:28,050 --> 00:30:29,880
Bullseye!

458
00:30:32,116 --> 00:30:33,282
Where're you going?

459
00:30:33,283 --> 00:30:34,316
It's lunch time.

460
00:30:34,317 --> 00:30:35,250
He's not happy.

461
00:30:35,251 --> 00:30:36,317
Why?

462
00:30:38,016 --> 00:30:40,183
I don't think what A-hao did was okay.

463
00:30:41,650 --> 00:30:43,909
Was it that serious?

464
00:30:43,910 --> 00:30:46,416
He just missed one of his exams.

465
00:30:46,417 --> 00:30:48,382
I bet for that Straight A student,

466
00:30:48,383 --> 00:30:50,817
this incident will be very hard for him to take.

467
00:30:51,817 --> 00:30:53,416
You've really hurt the enemy this time.

468
00:30:53,417 --> 00:30:55,982
I heard that he punched you pretty hard.

469
00:30:55,983 --> 00:30:57,616
It was a fight.

470
00:30:57,617 --> 00:30:58,783
It wasn't getting hit.

471
00:30:58,784 --> 00:31:00,749
It wasn't a fight.

472
00:31:00,750 --> 00:31:01,849
But what I heard was he didn't even care about the teacher trying to hold him back.

473
00:31:01,850 --> 00:31:03,115
But what I heard was he didn't even care about the teacher trying to hold him back.

474
00:31:03,116 --> 00:31:04,616
He almost got hit.

475
00:31:04,617 --> 00:31:05,716
Also, he cried like someone gone mad.

476
00:31:05,717 --> 00:31:07,909
Also, he cried like someone gone mad.

477
00:31:07,910 --> 00:31:09,082
No way!

478
00:31:09,083 --> 00:31:10,649
None of that's real.

479
00:31:10,650 --> 00:31:11,550
But that's what everyone is saying. Isn't that right?

480
00:31:11,550 --> 00:31:12,050
But that's what everyone is saying. Isn't that right?

481
00:31:12,051 --> 00:31:13,216
Just to be able to take the exam, he begged the teacher.

482
00:31:13,217 --> 00:31:14,549
Just to be able to take the exam, he begged the teacher.

483
00:31:14,550 --> 00:31:15,982
Xiang Haoting was there, too.

484
00:31:15,983 --> 00:31:17,449
If you don't believe me, go ask Xiang Haoting.

485
00:31:17,450 --> 00:31:18,283
Really?

486
00:31:18,283 --> 00:31:19,050
Tell us.

487
00:31:19,051 --> 00:31:20,383
What really happened?

488
00:31:26,350 --> 00:31:28,150
Hey!

489
00:31:29,617 --> 00:31:31,483
Why don't you say it?

490
00:31:38,950 --> 00:31:42,350
Let's think about where we're going for winter break, okay?

491
00:31:46,483 --> 00:31:48,450
How about going to the hot springs?

492
00:31:51,050 --> 00:31:53,349
Sure.

493
00:31:53,350 --> 00:31:55,350
Can we really?

494
00:31:59,584 --> 00:32:01,382
Then... this time, only the two of us.

495
00:32:01,383 --> 00:32:03,983
Then... this time, only the two of us.

496
00:32:05,350 --> 00:32:08,417
None of your brothers can come.

497
00:32:12,850 --> 00:32:14,483
Understand?

498
00:32:39,450 --> 00:32:41,250
Let's go.

499
00:32:52,250 --> 00:32:55,349
So he was looking at the grades just now.

500
00:32:55,350 --> 00:32:57,049
For him, grades are really very important.

501
00:32:57,050 --> 00:32:58,817
For him, grades are really very important.

502
00:33:01,483 --> 00:33:02,817
Let me see how you did this time.

503
00:33:03,983 --> 00:33:07,016
It'll be faster counting from the last place.

504
00:33:09,116 --> 00:33:10,716
Wow, 50 points.

505
00:33:10,717 --> 00:33:12,849
How did you manage to get that?

506
00:33:12,850 --> 00:33:15,283
Your dad's going to give you hell.

507
00:33:22,983 --> 00:33:26,584
So that's why I wanted to ask Brother Chigang to help me out.

508
00:33:29,483 --> 00:33:31,879
Don't you need to prepare for next January's GSATs?

509
00:33:31,880 --> 00:33:34,349
I don't want to affect my studies either.

510
00:33:34,350 --> 00:33:35,516
That's why I'm asking if Brother Chigang has any high paying part-time work.

511
00:33:35,517 --> 00:33:38,416
That's why I'm asking if Brother Chigang has any high paying part-time work.

512
00:33:38,417 --> 00:33:41,115
I'm hoping you can refer me.

513
00:33:41,116 --> 00:33:42,717
You're short on cash?

514
00:33:44,717 --> 00:33:46,750
How can you not have enough money?

515
00:33:52,483 --> 00:33:54,483
Don't be afraid, tell me the truth.

516
00:33:55,880 --> 00:33:57,182
Brother Chigang, I really can't find any high paying part-time jobs.

517
00:33:57,183 --> 00:33:59,216
Brother Chigang, I really can't find any high paying part-time jobs.

518
00:33:59,217 --> 00:34:01,150
Please help me.

519
00:34:09,250 --> 00:34:10,880
Little Gu, if you're really in trouble,

520
00:34:12,317 --> 00:34:14,115
Little Gu, if you're really in trouble,

521
00:34:14,116 --> 00:34:15,349
you have to let me know.

522
00:34:15,350 --> 00:34:17,350
Okay?

523
00:34:26,083 --> 00:34:28,050
I'm not stealing your girlfriend.

524
00:34:38,283 --> 00:34:40,282
I didn't do anything wrong, why should I apologize?

525
00:34:40,283 --> 00:34:42,382
I won't get up unless you agree.

526
00:34:42,383 --> 00:34:44,417
I can't agree.

527
00:36:28,317 --> 00:36:29,910
Hi-Hi--

528
00:36:32,250 --> 00:36:33,616
Why are you walking so fast?

529
00:36:33,617 --> 00:36:35,657
How am I going to pretend to meet you by coincidence?

530
00:37:00,784 --> 00:37:03,116
What are you doing here?

531
00:37:06,150 --> 00:37:09,150
I... I...

532
00:37:11,083 --> 00:37:14,483
- I was passing by.
- Passing by?

533
00:37:36,584 --> 00:37:38,449
What am I saying?

534
00:37:38,450 --> 00:37:39,879
Passing by?

535
00:37:39,880 --> 00:37:41,850
Am I stupid?

536
00:37:43,116 --> 00:37:45,083
What a lousy excuse.

537
00:37:57,450 --> 00:37:59,516
You bought too much stuff.

538
00:37:59,517 --> 00:38:01,350
Why did you come see me today?

539
00:38:03,550 --> 00:38:04,880
I have something to ask you.

540
00:38:06,250 --> 00:38:07,317
NT$300.

541
00:38:08,150 --> 00:38:11,349
I'm trying to look out for your brother.

542
00:38:11,350 --> 00:38:13,049
You're really looking out for him?

543
00:38:13,050 --> 00:38:14,149
Of course.

544
00:38:14,150 --> 00:38:15,749
Then add another NT$100.

545
00:38:15,750 --> 00:38:18,550
Why are you Xiang's all alike?

546
00:38:24,750 --> 00:38:26,283
What's the matter with him?

547
00:38:27,517 --> 00:38:31,049
Lately, he's been in like a monkey state.

548
00:38:31,050 --> 00:38:32,549
Monkey state?

549
00:38:32,550 --> 00:38:34,016
Like this.

550
00:38:35,383 --> 00:38:37,483
"Nobody bother me now."

551
00:38:38,950 --> 00:38:40,416
Looks so much alike.

552
00:38:40,417 --> 00:38:43,482
Every time he regrets something, he turns into this monkey state.

553
00:38:43,483 --> 00:38:45,516
Every time he regrets something, he turns into this monkey state.

554
00:38:45,517 --> 00:38:46,549
Regret?

555
00:38:46,550 --> 00:38:49,683
Last time I saw him like this was in elementary school.

556
00:38:49,684 --> 00:38:53,049
He made the whole class dislike another student.

557
00:38:53,050 --> 00:38:56,583
Later, although he apologized and told everyone what really happened,

558
00:38:56,584 --> 00:38:58,824
but no one wanted anything to do with that student anyway.

559
00:39:01,617 --> 00:39:03,182
That's cruel.

560
00:39:03,183 --> 00:39:04,417
Yeah.

561
00:39:05,517 --> 00:39:07,317
So he's regretting something now?

562
00:39:11,550 --> 00:39:12,350
Regret?

563
00:39:12,351 --> 00:39:13,649
He knows how to regret?

564
00:39:13,650 --> 00:39:15,015
Seriously.

565
00:39:15,016 --> 00:39:16,684
What is he regretting now?

566
00:39:17,684 --> 00:39:19,050
You really want to know?

567
00:39:20,650 --> 00:39:22,217
NT$500.

568
00:39:24,350 --> 00:39:26,249
You really are low!

569
00:39:26,250 --> 00:39:27,817
What?

570
00:39:28,750 --> 00:39:32,382
Xiang Yongching! Xiang Yongching! Xiang Yongching!

571
00:39:32,383 --> 00:39:33,879
You really are something!

572
00:39:33,880 --> 00:39:34,750
Immature!

573
00:39:34,751 --> 00:39:36,183
You're immature.

574
00:39:36,950 --> 00:39:38,015
Retard!

575
00:39:38,016 --> 00:39:39,880
You're the retard!

576
00:39:45,417 --> 00:39:47,283
Have you been waiting long?

577
00:39:50,150 --> 00:39:51,583
Sorry.

578
00:39:51,584 --> 00:39:53,182
I asked to meet you and had you come all this way.

579
00:39:53,183 --> 00:39:55,683
The young guy you referred... is he really capable?

580
00:39:55,684 --> 00:39:57,749
The young guy you referred... is he really capable?

581
00:39:57,750 --> 00:39:59,182
As long as you don't give him too many hours,

582
00:39:59,183 --> 00:40:01,216
keep things simple and uncomplicated.

583
00:40:01,217 --> 00:40:02,949
Because he's still a student, he'll probably need to keep a low profile.

584
00:40:02,950 --> 00:40:05,784
Because he's still a student, he'll probably need to keep a low profile.

585
00:40:06,450 --> 00:40:08,149
Another thing...

586
00:40:08,150 --> 00:40:09,349
If possible, I'd like to come by your workplace to take a look.

587
00:40:09,350 --> 00:40:12,217
If possible, I'd like to come by your workplace to take a look.

588
00:40:16,083 --> 00:40:18,516
Is he your boyfriend?

589
00:40:18,517 --> 00:40:19,616
No.

590
00:40:19,617 --> 00:40:23,182
If not, then how come I haven't been able to get you to come out lately.

591
00:40:23,183 --> 00:40:25,684
To have some drinks.

592
00:40:36,217 --> 00:40:37,716
You, are always too serious.

593
00:40:37,717 --> 00:40:39,850
You, are always too serious.

594
00:40:41,183 --> 00:40:43,116
Let's find a time to have a drink sometime.

595
00:40:46,880 --> 00:40:49,083
Do you have anything else you want to say to me?

596
00:40:51,050 --> 00:40:52,616
Right.

597
00:40:52,617 --> 00:40:54,350
Thank you.

598
00:40:56,150 --> 00:40:58,784
That's not what I was looking for.

599
00:41:06,550 --> 00:41:08,617
Come pick it up when you make your delivery tomorrow.

600
00:41:09,383 --> 00:41:11,149
It's nothing, you always take care of us.

601
00:41:11,150 --> 00:41:12,182
Okay.

602
00:41:12,183 --> 00:41:13,016
Owner Chang, bye-bye.

603
00:41:13,017 --> 00:41:14,817
Little Gu!

604
00:41:16,183 --> 00:41:17,850
Brother Chigang.

605
00:41:19,684 --> 00:41:21,050
I found a job for you.

606
00:41:22,150 --> 00:41:23,516
Thank you, Brother Chigang.

607
00:41:23,517 --> 00:41:24,483
The pay's pretty good, too. NT$400 per hour

608
00:41:24,484 --> 00:41:25,716
The pay's pretty good, too. NT$400 per hour

609
00:41:25,717 --> 00:41:27,849
NT$400?

610
00:41:27,850 --> 00:41:30,549
It's a bar owned by my friend.

611
00:41:30,550 --> 00:41:32,116
A bar?

612
00:41:32,910 --> 00:41:34,549
Don't worry.

613
00:41:34,550 --> 00:41:36,879
The place is quite uncomplicated and clean.

614
00:41:36,880 --> 00:41:38,583
I go there myself, too.

615
00:41:38,584 --> 00:41:40,650
I go to get drinks, eat meals, and listen to music.

616
00:41:41,950 --> 00:41:43,416
The only thing is that his place is open until very late.

617
00:41:43,417 --> 00:41:45,749
Until 3:00 a.m.

618
00:41:45,750 --> 00:41:47,349
So I already took care of everything.

619
00:41:47,350 --> 00:41:49,449
You can only work on weekends.

620
00:41:49,450 --> 00:41:51,716
Did you hear me?

621
00:41:51,717 --> 00:41:53,149
Thank you, Brother Chigang.

622
00:41:53,150 --> 00:41:53,750
Also, you promised me before to put your studies first.

623
00:41:53,750 --> 00:41:56,416
Also, you promised me before to put your studies first.

624
00:41:56,417 --> 00:41:59,097
Once you've saved up enough money, I don't want you to go there anymore.

625
00:42:02,880 --> 00:42:04,283
Come.

626
00:42:07,050 --> 00:42:08,149
This bowl of noodles, finish it right now.

627
00:42:08,150 --> 00:42:10,416
This bowl of noodles, finish it right now.

628
00:42:10,417 --> 00:42:11,849
Brother Chigang...

629
00:42:11,850 --> 00:42:13,316
If you want to thank me, be good and listen to me.

630
00:42:13,317 --> 00:42:14,950
If you want to thank me, be good and listen to me.

631
00:42:19,584 --> 00:42:21,250
Eat it while it's still hot.

632
00:42:55,450 --> 00:42:57,482
Sad.

633
00:42:57,483 --> 00:43:00,617
I can only see you through my phone.

634
00:43:55,717 --> 00:43:58,050
You really haven't spent time with me lately.

635
00:44:45,784 --> 00:44:47,549
Should I answer it for you?

636
00:44:47,550 --> 00:44:49,183
No need.

637
00:44:50,083 --> 00:44:51,115
Hello?

638
00:44:51,116 --> 00:44:52,982
You get out of the car right now!

639
00:44:52,983 --> 00:44:54,784
Get out?

640
00:44:56,584 --> 00:44:58,449
Why do I need to get out of the car?

641
00:44:58,450 --> 00:45:00,650
I'm coming to find you now!

642
00:45:02,850 --> 00:45:03,817
Wait...

643
00:45:03,818 --> 00:45:05,149
You're following me?

644
00:45:05,150 --> 00:45:06,116
That's right!

645
00:45:06,117 --> 00:45:07,349
Lu Chigang, get out of the car, right now!

646
00:45:07,350 --> 00:45:09,817
Lu Chigang, get out of the car, right now!

647
00:45:36,750 --> 00:45:39,217
Can you please pull over up there?

648
00:45:48,983 --> 00:45:50,115
I'm sorry.

649
00:45:50,116 --> 00:45:52,550
Don't say sorry.

650
00:45:59,083 --> 00:46:01,417
If you have any trouble, call me.

651
00:46:23,710 --> 00:46:28,760
♫ I still don’t understand why you left ♫

652
00:46:28,810 --> 00:46:34,860
♫ I still don’t understand why I’m waiting ♫

653
00:46:34,900 --> 00:46:40,770
♫ Waiting for who will remember their responsibility ♫

654
00:46:40,900 --> 00:46:46,400
♫ I’m left at the original place wandering around alone ♫

655
00:46:46,400 --> 00:46:51,770
♫ When the blue sky and white clouds disappear ♫

656
00:46:51,790 --> 00:46:57,210
♫ When you take away the yellow sneakers and the red sweater ♫

657
00:46:57,210 --> 00:47:02,510
♫ When all the colors are gone along with you ♫

658
00:47:02,520 --> 00:47:09,370
♫ Only transparent tears that unceasingly fall accompany me ♫

659
00:47:09,400 --> 00:47:14,900
♫ I still don’t understand why you left ♫

00:47:21,010 --> 00:47:26,750
♫ Waiting for who will remember their responsibility ♫

662
00:47:26,800 --> 00:47:31,210
♫ I’m left at the original place wandering around alone ♫

663
00:47:31,220 --> 00:47:36,340
♫ When one story becomes two regrets ♫

664
00:47:36,360 --> 00:47:42,790
♫ Letting two hearts run towards two different futures ♫

665
00:47:42,830 --> 00:47:48,080
♫ All those that can’t be forgotten can only become regrets ♫

666
00:47:48,110 --> 00:47:55,690
♫ But I still can’t understand why the tears won’t stop ♫
