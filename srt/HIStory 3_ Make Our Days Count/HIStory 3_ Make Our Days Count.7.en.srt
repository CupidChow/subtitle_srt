14
00:03:21,600 --> 00:03:22,900
Hello?

15
00:03:23,600 --> 00:03:24,800
Hello?

16
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:27,800
Can you hear me?

17
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:31,300
Why don't you pick up the phone?

18
00:03:34,800 --> 00:03:37,299
Do you know how worried I was about you?

19
00:03:37,300 --> 00:03:39,800
What? What are you doing right now? Talk!

20
00:03:39,800 --> 00:03:42,899
Are you giving up? Don't want this anymore?

21
00:03:44,420 --> 00:03:45,980
Hello?

22
00:03:48,900 --> 00:03:50,800
Xiang Haoting.

23
00:03:53,600 --> 00:03:59,500
Xiang Haoting. Xiang Haoting. Xiang Haoting.

24
00:04:04,500 --> 00:04:07,699
You calling me, I heard everything.

25
00:04:08,400 --> 00:04:11,900
I will reply to your every word now.

26
00:04:11,900 --> 00:04:13,600
Did you hear me?

27
00:04:17,100 --> 00:04:18,700
Yes, I heard.

28
00:04:24,500 --> 00:04:27,800
You don't need to worry, I won't give up.

29
00:04:27,800 --> 00:04:31,399
I will do my best for you and for myself.

30
00:04:32,170 --> 00:04:34,090
You have to trust me.

31
00:04:38,700 --> 00:04:41,399
Work hard together.

32
00:04:41,400 --> 00:04:43,200
Be brave together.

33
00:04:44,900 --> 00:04:49,299
We need to continue, continue,

34
00:04:49,300 --> 00:04:51,100
and continue to be together.

35
00:04:53,200 --> 00:04:54,800
Together.

36
00:04:57,600 --> 00:04:59,550
Xiang Haoting.

37
00:04:59,550 --> 00:05:04,580
Xiang Haoting, bye-bye.

38
00:05:09,700 --> 00:05:11,800
Xiang Haoting.

39
00:05:20,800 --> 00:05:22,099
This is your soy milk.

40
00:05:22,100 --> 00:05:24,200
Be careful when you drink it, it's hot.

41
00:05:26,500 --> 00:05:28,100
Thank you!

42
00:05:30,850 --> 00:05:32,690
[I'm at work]
[Okay, then good luck at work]

43
00:05:41,400 --> 00:05:44,500
You have time to play with your phone at work.

44
00:05:45,600 --> 00:05:47,001
I... Because Xiang Haoting--

45
00:05:47,001 --> 00:05:49,399
When did you buy a phone?

46
00:05:49,400 --> 00:05:51,100
A few days ago.

47
00:05:56,700 --> 00:06:00,300
All because of him, you actually spent money to buy a phone?

48
00:06:00,300 --> 00:06:01,600
Not really.

49
00:06:01,600 --> 00:06:04,600
He gave this to me as a gift.

50
00:06:08,600 --> 00:06:11,700
Because it's from him, you agreed to keep the present.

51
00:06:11,700 --> 00:06:13,500
I...

52
00:06:17,520 --> 00:06:20,700
[When do you get off work]
[Why are you ignoring me]

53
00:06:20,700 --> 00:06:22,899
Seems like he's really looking for you.

54
00:06:22,900 --> 00:06:25,600
His messages are non-stop.

55
00:06:25,600 --> 00:06:27,399
They're nothing really important.

56
00:06:27,400 --> 00:06:29,500
- I'll turn off my phone now.
- Wait.

57
00:06:29,500 --> 00:06:34,799
If you turn off the phone, with Xiang Haoting's personality, for sure, he's going to rush to our store immediately.

58
00:06:36,400 --> 00:06:37,599
No, he won't.

59
00:06:37,600 --> 00:06:41,199
He's grounded at home now and can't leave the house unexpectedly.

60
00:06:50,400 --> 00:06:53,180
So, his parents are still against the idea of you two?

61
00:06:55,400 --> 00:06:58,599
But I promised him I won't give up.

62
00:07:05,800 --> 00:07:07,599
It's New Year's Eve today.

63
00:07:07,600 --> 00:07:11,599
Spend it with me. I'll take you out to dinner.

64
00:07:13,900 --> 00:07:15,800
Thank you, Brother Chigang.

65
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:22,999
I'm giving you five minutes. Hurry up and go reply to his messages.

66
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:24,600
I'll look after the store here.

67
00:07:39,900 --> 00:07:44,199
Hello, Aunt (on mother's side)! Happy New Year!

68
00:07:44,199 --> 00:07:46,199
I was just thinking. We just finished eating.

69
00:07:46,199 --> 00:07:47,699
I was going to take a shower before I called you,

70
00:07:47,700 --> 00:07:50,099
but you called me first.

71
00:07:50,100 --> 00:07:52,100
Aunt, wait. I'm going to ask the kids to wish you Happy New Year.

72
00:07:52,100 --> 00:07:53,299
Grand Aunt.

73
00:07:53,300 --> 00:07:55,099
Grand Aunt, Happy New Year!

74
00:07:55,100 --> 00:07:56,499
Wishing you good luck and prosperity.

75
00:07:56,500 --> 00:07:57,400
So obedient.

76
00:07:57,400 --> 00:07:58,400
Wait, Haoting's here, too.

77
00:07:58,401 --> 00:08:00,999
Haoting, it's Grand Aunt.

78
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:03,599
Grand Aunt, Happy New Year.

79
00:08:03,600 --> 00:08:04,450
Bye-bye.

80
00:08:04,451 --> 00:08:05,400
Be more energetic.

81
00:08:05,400 --> 00:08:06,899
Hello, Aunt.

82
00:08:06,900 --> 00:08:08,399
Nothing, he's doing some housework.

83
00:08:08,400 --> 00:08:11,099
So, yes! Yes.

84
00:08:11,100 --> 00:08:13,700
He's watching TV. Hang on, hang on.

85
00:08:13,700 --> 00:08:15,499
Aunt.

86
00:08:15,500 --> 00:08:19,199
Hello, Aunt. Happy New Year, may you have lots of luck in the Year of the Rat!

87
00:08:21,800 --> 00:08:23,199
All's good, all's good.

88
00:08:23,200 --> 00:08:25,399
Next time when Uncle and Aunt come up to visit,

89
00:08:25,400 --> 00:08:29,399
I'll be the host. I'll make up for New Year's dinner.

90
00:08:29,399 --> 00:08:31,110
Okay, wait a minute.

91
00:08:32,100 --> 00:08:34,899
Hello, Aunt.

92
00:08:34,900 --> 00:08:37,400
Let me tell you, Tomorrow morning, I'll give Aunt (on father's side) a call.

93
00:08:37,400 --> 00:08:39,299
I'll call her to give her New Year greetings, okay?

94
00:08:39,300 --> 00:08:42,099
Okay, Happy New Year! Goodbye.

95
00:08:43,200 --> 00:08:44,499
Swiping on his phone all day.

96
00:08:44,500 --> 00:08:46,700
I don't know what he's doing.

97
00:08:49,600 --> 00:08:51,799
It's okay. Daddy don't be angry.

98
00:08:51,800 --> 00:08:53,599
It's New Year's, be happy, keep smiling.

99
00:08:53,600 --> 00:08:57,570
This way, we'll have a good and smooth year. Okay?

100
00:08:57,570 --> 00:08:59,320
Okay.

101
00:09:04,400 --> 00:09:05,900
Here.

102
00:09:05,900 --> 00:09:08,399
Mommy, Happy New Year!

103
00:09:08,400 --> 00:09:10,500
You're giving it to me first.

104
00:09:12,300 --> 00:09:15,100
"To my most beloved..."

105
00:09:16,500 --> 00:09:18,800
So romantic.

106
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:25,500
Mommy, thank you for all your hard work this year.

107
00:09:25,500 --> 00:09:27,600
It's my duty.

108
00:09:28,800 --> 00:09:30,400
Okay.

109
00:09:32,901 --> 00:09:37,000
Come. Red envelopes. Who wants them, come and get them.

110
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:40,299
I'm here before Brother. I want the big one.

111
00:09:40,300 --> 00:09:42,600
Say something auspicious.

112
00:09:42,600 --> 00:09:46,399
I wish Dad to be filled with happiness as vast as the Eastern Seas and your longevity as everlasting as the Southern Mountains.

113
00:09:46,400 --> 00:09:48,799
Daughter, this is New Year's, not a birthday celebration!

114
00:09:48,800 --> 00:09:50,599
Right! It's auspicious words nevertheless.

115
00:09:50,600 --> 00:09:51,799
Here's Mommy's.

116
00:09:51,800 --> 00:09:53,700
Thank you, Mommy.

117
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:56,799
Happy New Year!

118
00:09:56,800 --> 00:09:59,299
Give me the red envelope.

119
00:09:59,300 --> 00:10:00,900
- Why are you young kids like this?
- Think of something creative.

120
00:10:00,901 --> 00:10:02,199
More sweet talk.

121
00:10:02,200 --> 00:10:03,100
Everlasting youth and beauty!

122
00:10:03,101 --> 00:10:06,099
Right, that's the way to say it!

123
00:10:06,100 --> 00:10:07,499
Okay.

124
00:10:07,500 --> 00:10:08,800
Then...

125
00:10:10,300 --> 00:10:12,880
There's still a red envelope. Who hasn't got one yet?

126
00:10:15,200 --> 00:10:18,299
- Xiang Haoting!
- What?

127
00:10:18,299 --> 00:10:19,800
Red envelope.

128
00:10:23,500 --> 00:10:25,199
Thank you. Thank you.

129
00:10:25,200 --> 00:10:26,599
What thanks?

130
00:10:26,600 --> 00:10:29,700
Besides this, you don't have anything else to say?

131
00:10:31,600 --> 00:10:33,799
You haven't agreed to let us date.

132
00:10:33,800 --> 00:10:36,800
I don't want to say any auspicious words to you.

133
00:10:39,500 --> 00:10:41,700
You're not going to say anything, but expect to get red envelopes from us?

134
00:10:41,700 --> 00:10:42,899
You called me to come over here.

135
00:10:42,900 --> 00:10:44,299
If you don't want to give it, then don't.

136
00:10:44,300 --> 00:10:45,499
Strange.

137
00:10:45,500 --> 00:10:48,280
It's New Year's, what's with that tone of voice?

138
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:52,400
Take them back.

139
00:10:54,700 --> 00:10:57,600
Tomorrow, ask Yu Shigu to come by the house.

140
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:03,499
What do you mean?

141
00:11:03,499 --> 00:11:05,299
Why are you looking for him? What do you want to do with him?

142
00:11:05,300 --> 00:11:09,099
What's with your attitude? Do you think we're going to hit him and beat him?

143
00:11:11,900 --> 00:11:13,599
Regarding Student Yu's request,

144
00:11:13,600 --> 00:11:15,599
Dad and I have already discussed it.

145
00:11:15,600 --> 00:11:18,599
We want to let him know our decision.

146
00:11:18,600 --> 00:11:22,699
If you're going to refuse him or yell at him, just direct it to me.

147
00:11:22,699 --> 00:11:24,999
We want to talk to him, not you.

148
00:11:25,001 --> 00:11:28,499
If you don't ask him to come by, then forget it.

149
00:11:32,400 --> 00:11:34,299
Sister, come.

150
00:11:34,300 --> 00:11:36,299
Take all of these red envelopes.

151
00:11:36,300 --> 00:11:37,799
Really?

152
00:11:37,800 --> 00:11:40,200
Thank you, Mommy.

153
00:11:40,200 --> 00:11:43,600
Mommy is the most beautiful woman in this world.

154
00:11:43,600 --> 00:11:45,100
Thank you!

155
00:11:47,500 --> 00:11:49,100
So sweet.

156
00:11:57,400 --> 00:12:00,099
Everyone, eat more.

157
00:12:00,100 --> 00:12:02,399
Happy New Year!

158
00:12:02,400 --> 00:12:04,200
Bottoms up!

159
00:12:06,900 --> 00:12:09,900
Brother Chigang. Here, let me give you a new glass.

160
00:12:09,900 --> 00:12:11,699
So kind.

161
00:12:11,700 --> 00:12:13,310
Happy New Year.

162
00:12:17,300 --> 00:12:19,600
You need to eat more. So thin.

163
00:12:19,600 --> 00:12:21,580
- Hurry, it's almost time.
- Hurry, give me one.

164
00:12:21,600 --> 00:12:23,700
- Here.
- Hurry and pass it.

165
00:12:23,700 --> 00:12:25,600
Here, use your mouth to open it.

166
00:12:25,601 --> 00:12:27,499
I don't dare to.

167
00:12:27,500 --> 00:12:28,500
You can do it.

168
00:12:28,501 --> 00:12:30,299
Okay, take it.

169
00:12:30,300 --> 00:12:32,299
- Give one to Yu Shi.
- Thanks.

170
00:12:32,299 --> 00:12:34,000
Ten seconds left.

171
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:35,900
Hurry, ten seconds!

172
00:12:35,901 --> 00:12:40,199
Five, four, three, two, one!

173
00:12:40,200 --> 00:12:42,400
Happy New Year!

174
00:12:49,700 --> 00:12:53,100
Cheers!

175
00:12:53,100 --> 00:12:53,999
Together!

176
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:54,900
Happy New Year!

177
00:12:54,901 --> 00:12:56,480
Together!

178
00:12:57,600 --> 00:13:00,100
Time for the main event!

179
00:13:00,100 --> 00:13:02,899
Doesn't it feel like something is missing now that we're here?

180
00:13:02,900 --> 00:13:04,499
Lucky money!

181
00:13:04,500 --> 00:13:06,800
Get your red envelopes!

182
00:13:09,600 --> 00:13:11,200
This!

183
00:13:12,600 --> 00:13:14,599
There are no free lunches in this world.

184
00:13:14,600 --> 00:13:16,199
Give me some auspicious words.

185
00:13:16,200 --> 00:13:17,200
Who wants to start? Who?

186
00:13:17,201 --> 00:13:18,399
I'll go.

187
00:13:18,400 --> 00:13:19,499
Three "su" tiau brothers.
(T/N: sounds the same as French fry, with "su" same sound as Rat in Chinese to mean Year of the Rat)

188
00:13:19,500 --> 00:13:20,300
What?

189
00:13:20,301 --> 00:13:21,399
That's too crappy.

190
00:13:21,400 --> 00:13:22,499
I have some dishes in the kitchen.

191
00:13:22,500 --> 00:13:24,099
Help me get them. Thanks!

192
00:13:24,100 --> 00:13:25,199
Just kidding!

193
00:13:25,200 --> 00:13:26,699
Here, even this will get one.

194
00:13:26,700 --> 00:13:27,999
My turn!

195
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:29,299
They say...

196
00:13:29,300 --> 00:13:33,500
All lovers will find their other half.
(T/N: using a play on the same word sound as Rat for the Year of the Rat)

197
00:13:35,100 --> 00:13:37,900
Come! Continue to eat, okay?

198
00:13:37,900 --> 00:13:39,899
One day the rabbit said,

199
00:13:39,900 --> 00:13:41,499
"I want to be a rabbit fairy in the future."

200
00:13:41,500 --> 00:13:43,699
Then the rat said, "I want to be a rat fairy."

201
00:13:43,700 --> 00:13:46,300
Then the eagle said, "I don't want to play anymore."

202
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:53,699
Little Gu, so you high school students are into these types of jokes now.

203
00:13:54,599 --> 00:13:56,699
Brother Chigang, thank you.

204
00:13:56,700 --> 00:13:58,300
Today was really fun.

205
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:02,499
Which dish did you like the best?

206
00:14:02,500 --> 00:14:03,799
Hot pot.

207
00:14:03,800 --> 00:14:05,299
I knew you liked the hot pot best.

208
00:14:05,300 --> 00:14:08,000
I watched you eating it non-stop from the beginning until the end.

209
00:14:09,500 --> 00:14:12,899
My friends all said that you have a very cute personality.

210
00:14:12,900 --> 00:14:16,299
They all seem really nice and very interesting.

211
00:14:18,200 --> 00:14:20,499
Thanks for walking me out, I'm good here.

212
00:14:20,500 --> 00:14:22,699
This isn't your house yet.

213
00:14:22,700 --> 00:14:25,300
I want to go buy something first.

214
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:28,300
Here.

215
00:14:33,100 --> 00:14:34,600
Brother Chigang.

216
00:14:36,100 --> 00:14:39,199
This is a little something for you. Accept it.

217
00:14:42,300 --> 00:14:45,100
Trust me, things will get better.

218
00:14:55,400 --> 00:14:58,000
Thank you, Big Brother.

219
00:15:03,700 --> 00:15:05,530
Let me know when you get home.

220
00:15:06,400 --> 00:15:07,900
Be careful going home.

221
00:15:07,900 --> 00:15:09,600
Bye-bye.

222
00:16:01,780 --> 00:16:06,270
[Dad]

223
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:21,700
Happy New Year.

224
00:16:41,900 --> 00:16:45,700
Another year. I'm a little late tonight.

225
00:16:45,700 --> 00:16:47,900
Happy New Year!

226
00:17:00,300 --> 00:17:02,700
Look. My sister still loves me.

227
00:17:02,700 --> 00:17:05,000
She returned my red envelopes to me.

228
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:08,500
You start thinking about where we should go and what we should eat.

229
00:17:08,500 --> 00:17:10,200
Remember.

230
00:17:11,300 --> 00:17:13,300
I really miss you.

231
00:17:13,300 --> 00:17:15,599
I really wish that as soon as I open my eyes,

232
00:17:15,600 --> 00:17:18,399
you will suddenly appear in front of me.

233
00:17:18,400 --> 00:17:23,000
How many more hours must I wait until I can see you?

234
00:17:25,200 --> 00:17:26,599
Persevere.

235
00:17:26,600 --> 00:17:30,699
For us. You must continue to work hard, too.

236
00:17:30,699 --> 00:17:33,600
Okay. Hurry and get to bed.

237
00:17:34,400 --> 00:17:35,999
Don't run off somewhere.

238
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:39,900
I will send it to check on you.

239
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:50,499
I want to tell you "I'm sorry."

240
00:17:50,500 --> 00:17:54,299
Next New Year's I will for sure be right beside you.

241
00:17:54,300 --> 00:17:57,499
We still need to celebrate many, many more New Year's

242
00:17:57,500 --> 00:17:59,200
Don't get rid of me.

243
00:18:01,700 --> 00:18:03,300
Bye-bye. Goodnight.

244
00:18:03,300 --> 00:18:04,800
See you tomorrow.

245
00:18:09,300 --> 00:18:11,100
So silly, right?

246
00:19:02,500 --> 00:19:04,300
Brother Chigang.

247
00:19:10,300 --> 00:19:12,100
What are you doing here?

248
00:19:23,700 --> 00:19:25,800
Didn't you just finish New Year's Eve dinner?

249
00:19:25,800 --> 00:19:28,500
Won't your parents get mad?

250
00:19:28,500 --> 00:19:30,900
It's past midnight already.

251
00:19:30,900 --> 00:19:32,900
I just want to see you.

252
00:19:40,100 --> 00:19:44,000
Besides, I have something to tell you.

253
00:19:44,600 --> 00:19:46,300
What is it?

254
00:19:49,300 --> 00:19:52,299
Do you know what my new year's wish is?

255
00:19:52,300 --> 00:19:53,300
I don't know.

256
00:19:53,301 --> 00:19:54,900
What is it?

257
00:19:56,500 --> 00:19:59,400
I want to take you home.

258
00:19:59,400 --> 00:20:01,300
He let you leave home.

259
00:20:01,300 --> 00:20:03,699
I will let you go home.

260
00:20:03,700 --> 00:20:05,700
Go back to your own home.

261
00:20:07,800 --> 00:20:09,899
I want to let your parents accept you,

262
00:20:09,900 --> 00:20:12,200
and believe in our love.

263
00:20:15,500 --> 00:20:17,500
He was your first love.

264
00:20:20,600 --> 00:20:22,800
I want to be your last lover.

265
00:20:38,400 --> 00:20:39,900
Look.

266
00:20:40,500 --> 00:20:43,499
This has our names engraved on it.

267
00:20:43,500 --> 00:20:47,299
Which means that from today forward,

268
00:20:47,300 --> 00:20:49,400
you belong to me.

269
00:20:51,100 --> 00:20:57,370
♫ Just let us be good together ♫

270
00:20:57,370 --> 00:21:02,900
♫ Don’t guess how many storms will be in the future ♫

271
00:21:02,900 --> 00:21:09,800
♫ No one can be sure of what tomorrow’s weather will be like ♫

272
00:21:09,800 --> 00:21:14,930
♫ I only know that once I wake up, I want to see you the most ♫

273
00:21:18,400 --> 00:21:19,799
Maybe in the future technology will advance

274
00:21:19,800 --> 00:21:22,399
to let us live to 100 years old.

275
00:21:22,400 --> 00:21:25,299
But I feel that...

276
00:21:25,300 --> 00:21:28,000
fourteen times more is just right.

277
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:31,099
Why fourteen times?

278
00:21:31,100 --> 00:21:34,100
Because fourteen times more, you'll be 100.

279
00:21:38,400 --> 00:21:40,400
Silly.

280
00:21:42,240 --> 00:21:45,480
♫ Don’t be in a rush to prove that in between us ♫

281
00:21:45,480 --> 00:21:48,500
♫ Complicated languages do not exist ♫

282
00:21:48,500 --> 00:21:51,500
♫ Compared to passionate, I more so want to slowly ♫

283
00:21:51,500 --> 00:21:59,300
♫ Love you using the most familiar way for you ♫

284
00:22:01,370 --> 00:22:07,380
♫ Just let us be good together ♫

285
00:22:07,380 --> 00:22:14,200
♫ We’ve both lost ourselves before in love ♫

286
00:22:14,200 --> 00:22:18,700
I love you.

287
00:22:18,700 --> 00:22:20,070
I love you more.

288
00:22:20,070 --> 00:22:25,550
♫ I only know that in the future, I want to see you the most ♫

289
00:22:26,600 --> 00:22:32,040
♫ I want to see you the most ♫

290
00:23:11,500 --> 00:23:13,000
Let's go.

291
00:23:16,400 --> 00:23:17,900
So nervous.

292
00:23:20,900 --> 00:23:25,199
Don't worry. If my parents agree to let us be together, then all will be great.

293
00:23:25,199 --> 00:23:27,699
But if my dad starts to say unpleasant things,

294
00:23:27,700 --> 00:23:29,699
don't let it get to you.

295
00:23:29,700 --> 00:23:30,899
You just need to remember.

296
00:23:30,900 --> 00:23:33,099
Just make sure you do well on your college exams and that's all that matters.

297
00:23:33,100 --> 00:23:35,699
You're not taking your college exams?

298
00:23:35,700 --> 00:23:38,400
If my parents don't agree to let us be together, why bother taking the exams?

299
00:23:38,400 --> 00:23:39,799
I'll start working after I graduate.

300
00:23:39,800 --> 00:23:40,800
I won't allow it!

301
00:23:40,801 --> 00:23:43,399
I said that we're going to have a great future.

302
00:23:43,400 --> 00:23:46,800
Entering the workforce now, who cares what college you graduated from?

303
00:23:46,800 --> 00:23:47,600
But...

304
00:23:47,601 --> 00:23:48,999
It's okay.

305
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:51,999
I can work first then take my exams.

306
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:55,200
How about you go to college first then I'll go after you graduate?

307
00:23:58,000 --> 00:23:59,599
If you're not going, then I'm not going either.

308
00:23:59,600 --> 00:24:00,699
We'll work and make money together.

309
00:24:00,700 --> 00:24:02,200
No!

310
00:24:03,600 --> 00:24:08,000
No matter what we do, we will be together. Right?

311
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:10,700
Then listen to me; trust me.

312
00:24:10,700 --> 00:24:14,599
We will be able to prove to everyone that we will have a great life.

313
00:24:18,500 --> 00:24:21,199
Excuse me. To have to interrupt you two now,

314
00:24:21,200 --> 00:24:23,700
can you speed it up? Mom and Dad have been waiting a long time.

315
00:24:23,700 --> 00:24:24,901
Hurry, hurry, hurry. What's the rush?

316
00:24:24,901 --> 00:24:27,200
Can't you have better timing?

317
00:24:28,100 --> 00:24:29,100
Thank you.

318
00:24:29,101 --> 00:24:30,900
Xiang Haoting!

319
00:24:55,800 --> 00:24:58,500
Here! We've prepared tea.

320
00:24:59,600 --> 00:25:00,400
Daddy.

321
00:25:00,400 --> 00:25:02,800
Whoa! Mommy, is it Butterfly Pea tea?

322
00:25:02,800 --> 00:25:04,600
This is my mom's signature tea. It's very delicious.

323
00:25:04,600 --> 00:25:06,299
Thank you, Auntie.

324
00:25:06,300 --> 00:25:08,500
Here, Sister. Come sit here.

325
00:25:08,500 --> 00:25:09,899
And, Daddy, just wait a bit for the water.

326
00:25:09,900 --> 00:25:12,999
I'll sit off to the side. You guys talk.

327
00:25:15,800 --> 00:25:19,100
Then, I'll just cut right to the point.

328
00:25:19,800 --> 00:25:23,299
Student Yu, last time when you came to our house

329
00:25:23,299 --> 00:25:24,999
and said all those things to us,

330
00:25:25,000 --> 00:25:27,899
Haoting's dad and I have discussed it.

331
00:25:27,900 --> 00:25:30,599
We understand our son very well.

332
00:25:30,600 --> 00:25:33,099
We know too well what he's capable of.

333
00:25:33,100 --> 00:25:37,401
So as long as he gives a bit more effort, studies a little harder,

334
00:25:37,401 --> 00:25:40,300
he should be able to get into college this year.

335
00:25:41,200 --> 00:25:43,199
So, about your request,

336
00:25:43,200 --> 00:25:44,700
we...

337
00:25:48,200 --> 00:25:50,000
don't agree.

338
00:25:51,500 --> 00:25:53,400
No way, Mommy! No!

339
00:25:53,400 --> 00:25:55,699
That's because, during mid-terms, the test didn't cover that much material.

340
00:25:55,699 --> 00:25:57,900
So I could complete it without much effort and place second place.

341
00:25:57,900 --> 00:26:01,200
This time it's different. This exam covers six subjects and it's a huge amount of material.

342
00:26:01,200 --> 00:26:03,099
How can I do this alone?

343
00:26:03,100 --> 00:26:04,499
I will need Yu Shigu's help for sure.

344
00:26:04,500 --> 00:26:06,199
You can get in, yet you say you can't get in.

345
00:26:06,200 --> 00:26:07,799
So reckless!

346
00:26:07,800 --> 00:26:09,199
Don't even take your own future seriously!

347
00:26:09,200 --> 00:26:12,200
Then you guys help me take my future seriously!

348
00:26:12,200 --> 00:26:14,999
Just accept his request. It's not that hard.

349
00:26:14,999 --> 00:26:17,299
I just can't accept it!

350
00:26:17,300 --> 00:26:20,399
- I just don't want to let you do whatever you want.
- Dad, lately you've been very impolite when speaking.

351
00:26:20,399 --> 00:26:21,400
What's with your attitude?

352
00:26:21,401 --> 00:26:22,599
Don't argue!

353
00:26:22,600 --> 00:26:25,401
We're discussing the issue. Sit down. Sit.

354
00:26:30,700 --> 00:26:34,299
I was just starting now.

355
00:26:34,300 --> 00:26:36,399
I haven't gotten to the point yet.

356
00:26:36,400 --> 00:26:39,199
Main point? What main point?

357
00:26:43,900 --> 00:26:45,200
Mom.

358
00:26:51,600 --> 00:26:55,099
This main point is very important.

359
00:26:55,099 --> 00:26:59,999
So let's have Dad say it.

360
00:27:02,200 --> 00:27:05,499
You, kid, really need someone to teach you a lesson. Always going against me.

361
00:27:05,499 --> 00:27:07,299
I'm telling you, I'm your father!

362
00:27:07,300 --> 00:27:09,900
What I say goes here in this place!

363
00:27:15,500 --> 00:27:18,100
Dad, have you finished telling us the main point?

364
00:27:19,800 --> 00:27:21,999
Just say whatever it is you want to say!

365
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:24,700
What the main point is, you still don't understand?

366
00:27:24,700 --> 00:27:27,799
Let me tell you that getting into college is just the basics.

367
00:27:27,799 --> 00:27:29,770
It's too easy!

368
00:27:30,600 --> 00:27:33,099
You say your future is going to be great,

369
00:27:33,100 --> 00:27:35,200
then the defining point is--

370
00:27:40,600 --> 00:27:43,499
Area of study. Physics! I'll study Physics, all right?

371
00:27:43,499 --> 00:27:46,100
Whatever faculty you get into is not that important!

372
00:27:46,100 --> 00:27:47,799
Since the change from year to year is so large now,

373
00:27:47,800 --> 00:27:49,399
whatever the trends are changes very quickly.

374
00:27:49,400 --> 00:27:51,799
Just like those computer things before.

375
00:27:51,800 --> 00:27:53,399
After graduating four years later, all of it was gone.

376
00:27:53,399 --> 00:27:55,699
Right, trends will die out.

377
00:27:55,700 --> 00:27:58,400
I'm almost out of patience. Dad, what is the main point you're trying to say? Can you just say it?

378
00:27:58,400 --> 00:28:02,100
You're really strange. Your classmate hasn't said anything. What's your rush?

379
00:28:03,600 --> 00:28:06,299
Uncle. Auntie. As long as you agree to let us be together,

380
00:28:06,300 --> 00:28:08,599
whatever your requests are, I will do whatever I can to achieve them.

381
00:28:08,600 --> 00:28:11,900
You see that? See how polite other people are? Do you understand that?

382
00:28:12,800 --> 00:28:14,499
Actually, my request is very simple.

383
00:28:14,500 --> 00:28:17,999
As long as you can let this kid get into college this year!

384
00:28:17,999 --> 00:28:19,800
Retaking the exam doesn't count!

385
00:28:19,800 --> 00:28:21,600
It doesn't even have to be the most popular department,

386
00:28:21,600 --> 00:28:23,599
but it can't be one that's too unpopular.

387
00:28:23,600 --> 00:28:26,800
The most important thing is to be able to get into a national college.

388
00:28:26,800 --> 00:28:28,400
For sure!

389
00:28:31,200 --> 00:28:33,499
Any of the top five national colleges.

390
00:28:33,500 --> 00:28:36,699
As long as he can get in, I'll agree to let you guys be together.

391
00:28:36,699 --> 00:28:37,999
No problem!

392
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:39,299
What are you agreeing for?

393
00:28:39,300 --> 00:28:40,899
I didn't ask you..

394
00:28:40,900 --> 00:28:43,299
But I'm the one that needs to take the test.

395
00:28:43,300 --> 00:28:45,999
For sure! Probably.

396
00:28:45,999 --> 00:28:47,600
It doesn't matter!

397
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:52,700
For sure. I will do whatever it takes to achieve this.

398
00:28:52,700 --> 00:28:54,599
Top five!

399
00:28:54,600 --> 00:28:56,299
Get in first and we'll see.

400
00:28:56,300 --> 00:28:58,499
- Top five.
- Top five.

401
00:28:58,500 --> 00:29:00,100
National.

402
00:29:05,100 --> 00:29:06,699
Drink some water.

403
00:29:06,700 --> 00:29:08,600
Dad, do you have enough?

404
00:29:22,300 --> 00:29:24,100
Lately, I'm tired from studying.

405
00:29:26,800 --> 00:29:29,899
I brought him home to my parents yesterday.

406
00:29:29,899 --> 00:29:31,399
Really?

407
00:29:31,400 --> 00:29:33,799
So, you guys have decided to go public?

408
00:29:33,800 --> 00:29:34,899
Yeah.

409
00:29:34,900 --> 00:29:37,199
But your parents really agreed?

410
00:29:37,200 --> 00:29:38,100
I guess so.

411
00:29:38,101 --> 00:29:40,399
- Really?
- That's amazing!

412
00:29:40,400 --> 00:29:42,499
Condition is that he has to get into a national college.

413
00:29:42,500 --> 00:29:44,099
Impossible! National!

414
00:29:44,100 --> 00:29:46,500
Top five ranking.

415
00:29:46,500 --> 00:29:47,999
Top five!

416
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:50,599
I sit here and regret to inform the two of you,

417
00:29:50,600 --> 00:29:53,700
please cherish your every day together staring now.

418
00:29:54,700 --> 00:29:56,599
We all support you. Good luck!

419
00:29:56,599 --> 00:29:58,099
- You have my support! Good luck.
- Good luck.

420
00:29:58,100 --> 00:29:59,899
Get out of here with the good luck!

421
00:29:59,900 --> 00:30:02,099
And the cherish every day!

422
00:30:02,100 --> 00:30:03,699
Brothers don't support your brother.

423
00:30:03,700 --> 00:30:06,299
No one seems to believe I can do it.

424
00:30:06,300 --> 00:30:08,099
Getting into the top five is really hard.

425
00:30:08,100 --> 00:30:09,000
I know.

426
00:30:09,001 --> 00:30:14,199
So, this is how I can show my conviction. Right?

427
00:30:14,200 --> 00:30:15,599
True!

428
00:30:15,600 --> 00:30:16,899
For sure, give it your all!

429
00:30:16,900 --> 00:30:19,499
A-hao doesn't seem like he's messing around this time.

430
00:30:19,500 --> 00:30:22,099
If you don't achieve it, what will you guys do?

431
00:30:22,099 --> 00:30:23,399
We will achieve it for sure!

432
00:30:23,400 --> 00:30:25,399
Besides, he's here!

433
00:30:25,400 --> 00:30:26,599
Right?

434
00:30:26,600 --> 00:30:29,100
But what if you really don't get in?

435
00:30:32,200 --> 00:30:35,699
I won't let something like that happen, okay?

436
00:30:35,699 --> 00:30:37,800
You have to trust me.

437
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:41,499
But there are only five months left?

438
00:30:41,500 --> 00:30:43,400
No buts.

439
00:30:46,600 --> 00:30:48,199
Five months is still a long time.

440
00:30:48,200 --> 00:30:49,399
You saw how I didn't really put much into it,

441
00:30:49,400 --> 00:30:51,900
prepared for a week or two, and beat out Zhuang last time.

442
00:30:51,900 --> 00:30:55,499
If I really focus, I would scare even myself.

443
00:30:55,499 --> 00:30:58,800
Maybe I might even score better than you.

444
00:30:59,800 --> 00:31:01,500
Fine.

445
00:31:15,700 --> 00:31:17,300
Thank you.

446
00:31:20,900 --> 00:31:22,700
What are you guys doing?

447
00:31:32,300 --> 00:31:33,899
What are you guys doing?

448
00:31:33,900 --> 00:31:35,599
Wasn't someone being romantic just now?
(T/N: lit. aren't you two dispersing dog treats?)

449
00:31:35,600 --> 00:31:37,500
Just trying to fit in.

450
00:31:42,600 --> 00:31:46,000
Good. Very good.

451
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:47,800
Husky!

452
00:31:49,400 --> 00:31:51,100
Wolf!

453
00:31:52,200 --> 00:31:53,399
Your reward.

454
00:31:53,400 --> 00:31:54,900
Your turn.

455
00:31:59,500 --> 00:32:01,100
Shake.

456
00:32:01,100 --> 00:32:03,199
Hello, how are you?

457
00:32:03,200 --> 00:32:05,000
That's low.

458
00:32:06,300 --> 00:32:07,900
What are you doing?

459
00:32:08,500 --> 00:32:10,600
Paralyzed Chihuahua.

460
00:32:12,800 --> 00:32:15,399
The brother of the paralyzed Chihuahua.

461
00:32:15,400 --> 00:32:16,799
Twins.

462
00:32:16,800 --> 00:32:19,199
Not bad, pretty talented dogs.

463
00:32:19,200 --> 00:32:20,399
You're the dog!

464
00:32:20,400 --> 00:32:21,699
King of dogs.

465
00:32:21,700 --> 00:32:23,700
King of dogs, right! You're the dog king.

466
00:32:23,700 --> 00:32:26,300
- I'm dog king?
- Yeah.

467
00:32:26,300 --> 00:32:28,200
I want to hear the dog king bark.

468
00:32:29,300 --> 00:32:30,300
- Me?
- That's right.

469
00:32:30,300 --> 00:32:31,300
Okay.

470
00:32:31,301 --> 00:32:32,799
Wait!

471
00:32:32,800 --> 00:32:35,800
I want to hear the "in heat" version.

472
00:32:35,800 --> 00:32:37,799
Sure.

473
00:32:37,800 --> 00:32:41,699
In heat version. Leave that for my master.

474
00:32:41,699 --> 00:32:42,999
Okay.

475
00:32:43,000 --> 00:32:45,600
Study god. Call of the Study god.

476
00:32:59,300 --> 00:33:02,000
Here, you just stick to eating your carrots.

477
00:33:02,700 --> 00:33:04,600
So cute.

478
00:33:15,100 --> 00:33:17,099
Reporting the target's location.

479
00:33:17,100 --> 00:33:19,900
Left 45 degrees.

480
00:33:21,600 --> 00:33:23,599
Locked on target.

481
00:33:23,600 --> 00:33:25,000
Fire!

482
00:33:27,400 --> 00:33:28,200
Nice shot!

483
00:33:28,201 --> 00:33:29,699
Great job, soldier Xia En!

484
00:33:29,700 --> 00:33:31,499
Mission report!

485
00:33:31,500 --> 00:33:34,000
Reporting, Officer. Target is eliminated.

486
00:33:36,400 --> 00:33:37,899
Gao Xiao-chun, what are you doing?

487
00:33:37,900 --> 00:33:39,899
Are you upset?

488
00:33:39,900 --> 00:33:41,600
I didn't do well on the exam and got yelled at by my mom.

489
00:33:41,600 --> 00:33:42,999
How bad did you do?

490
00:33:43,000 --> 00:33:45,799
Don't ask. You'd be afraid.

491
00:33:47,400 --> 00:33:49,199
How did you do?

492
00:33:49,200 --> 00:33:50,999
Don't ask. You'll be scared.

493
00:33:50,999 --> 00:33:52,099
Scared!

494
00:33:52,100 --> 00:33:54,599
The one that should be afraid now is Xiang Haoting.

495
00:33:54,600 --> 00:33:56,799
That's right. Where is he?

496
00:33:56,799 --> 00:33:59,599
Him? He probably did really bad.

497
00:33:59,599 --> 00:34:02,500
So he's comforting his little lover.

498
00:34:03,200 --> 00:34:04,999
Right, Gao Chun-chun.

499
00:34:05,000 --> 00:34:07,300
- Don't approach!
- Why not?

500
00:34:15,800 --> 00:34:18,000
He's not going to save me! Don't come close!

501
00:34:19,400 --> 00:34:21,700
Why don't you come down?

502
00:34:33,700 --> 00:34:37,100
This round of tests isn't accurate anyway.

503
00:34:37,900 --> 00:34:41,200
I didn't really concentrate this time.

504
00:34:41,200 --> 00:34:44,099
We were kept apart then.

505
00:34:44,100 --> 00:34:46,599
Don't care too much about the mark this time.

506
00:34:46,600 --> 00:34:48,899
But you really scored very low this time.

507
00:34:48,900 --> 00:34:51,099
I know!

508
00:34:51,100 --> 00:34:54,099
Because I wrote recklessly!

509
00:34:54,100 --> 00:34:55,299
I saw the question before I finished reading the question I just wrote down the answer.

510
00:34:55,300 --> 00:34:57,500
I saw the question before I finished reading the question I just wrote down the answer.

511
00:34:57,500 --> 00:34:58,599
AACCB.

512
00:34:58,600 --> 00:35:00,299
BBCAA.

513
00:35:00,300 --> 00:35:02,100
I just filled in haphazardly!

514
00:35:07,500 --> 00:35:10,799
You have to believe me. I will get into a national college!

515
00:35:10,799 --> 00:35:12,200
Really!

516
00:35:15,700 --> 00:35:19,000
Look. This is my study schedule.

517
00:35:19,000 --> 00:35:21,499
Pretty detailed, right?

518
00:35:21,500 --> 00:35:24,199
I even put in my shower times.

519
00:35:24,200 --> 00:35:28,500
Once we get to the mock exams, I'll definitely beat out Zhuang for sure.

520
00:35:31,800 --> 00:35:33,699
Okay.

521
00:35:33,700 --> 00:35:36,600
Then, this week, Brother Chigang invited me to celebrate by getting me full-marks meal.

522
00:35:36,600 --> 00:35:38,299
You can't come.

523
00:35:38,300 --> 00:35:40,600
Study per your study schedule.

524
00:35:47,800 --> 00:35:50,200
I still need to eat.

525
00:35:54,300 --> 00:35:56,399
Hunger breeds discontentment, eating is my first priority.

526
00:35:56,400 --> 00:35:59,299
How can you not eat because of studying?

527
00:35:59,300 --> 00:36:02,199
Eating is to ensure you have what it takes to continue to go on.

528
00:36:02,200 --> 00:36:04,499
Then you eat at home.

529
00:36:04,500 --> 00:36:06,099
Brother Chigang invited me to a restaurant.

530
00:36:06,100 --> 00:36:08,500
I don't know how long it takes to get there and back.

531
00:36:08,500 --> 00:36:10,199
You still want to waste time?

532
00:36:10,200 --> 00:36:13,000
I want to help you celebrate, too.

533
00:36:58,400 --> 00:37:00,800
I'll come and find you after we eat.

534
00:37:12,200 --> 00:37:15,000
I'll concentrate.

535
00:37:15,000 --> 00:37:16,900
I'll work hard.

536
00:37:16,900 --> 00:37:22,699
Then this weekend, you... will you give me a reward?

537
00:37:39,900 --> 00:37:43,599
Sunday afternoon 1:00 to 3:00 p.m. Chinese literature review.

538
00:38:06,100 --> 00:38:07,499
What is it?

539
00:38:07,500 --> 00:38:09,399
You called me over right after school.

540
00:38:09,400 --> 00:38:11,799
You don't need to be with your Yu Shigu?

541
00:38:11,800 --> 00:38:13,500
I have something to ask you.

542
00:38:15,200 --> 00:38:16,800
Very serious.

543
00:38:19,900 --> 00:38:22,100
He's coming to my place over the weekend.

544
00:38:23,600 --> 00:38:25,300
And then?

545
00:38:29,600 --> 00:38:32,500
Have you and your Brother Chigang done that before?

546
00:38:34,600 --> 00:38:36,800
You know, that…

547
00:38:37,600 --> 00:38:39,099
What are you talking about?

548
00:38:39,100 --> 00:38:41,199
I'm very serious now by asking you this question.

549
00:38:41,200 --> 00:38:42,599
Why are you asking such a stupid question?

550
00:38:42,600 --> 00:38:43,899
Why is this a stupid question?

551
00:38:43,900 --> 00:38:45,399
I haven't been with a guy like that before.

552
00:38:45,400 --> 00:38:47,099
I only know to ask you.

553
00:38:47,100 --> 00:38:48,899
We're exam students now.

554
00:38:48,900 --> 00:38:51,499
So? As exam students, we're not able to do that?

555
00:38:51,499 --> 00:38:54,000
I don't believe you guys haven't.

556
00:38:54,000 --> 00:38:55,800
Have you or not?

557
00:39:07,600 --> 00:39:09,799
Hurry up!

558
00:39:09,800 --> 00:39:10,999
Just go search online!

559
00:39:11,000 --> 00:39:12,299
I have already!

560
00:39:12,300 --> 00:39:14,099
The internet said that the first time will really hurt,

561
00:39:14,100 --> 00:39:15,799
but I don't want his first time to hurt.

562
00:39:15,800 --> 00:39:17,699
I would feel really bad.

563
00:39:17,700 --> 00:39:19,600
So, that's why I'm asking you.

564
00:39:20,600 --> 00:39:22,400
I don't know, just...

565
00:39:25,100 --> 00:39:27,699
If the mood is right, then...

566
00:39:27,700 --> 00:39:30,199
It won't hurt if the mood is right?

567
00:39:30,200 --> 00:39:32,800
How is that possible? It was your first time.

568
00:39:36,000 --> 00:39:38,500
I was the one that did this!

569
00:39:46,200 --> 00:39:48,500
Retard!

570
00:39:52,200 --> 00:39:55,900
Brother Chigang is really kind to you.

571
00:39:57,000 --> 00:39:59,599
This is called love.

572
00:39:59,600 --> 00:40:02,500
But I still haven't solved my problem!

573
00:40:02,500 --> 00:40:04,700
The weekend's almost here.

574
00:40:11,000 --> 00:40:13,800
How about we go and ask your Brother Chigang?

575
00:40:16,300 --> 00:40:18,500
Do you want to die right now?

576
00:40:22,400 --> 00:40:25,600
Then, you tell me what happened during your first time.

577
00:40:25,600 --> 00:40:28,101
Also, what was it like?

578
00:40:28,101 --> 00:40:30,299
Just the right time and right place and it happened?

579
00:40:30,300 --> 00:40:32,199
And if there are any special tricks?

580
00:40:32,200 --> 00:40:34,200
Or skills or things to watch out for,

581
00:40:34,200 --> 00:40:37,199
so that he can relax so it won't hurt as much--

582
00:40:37,200 --> 00:40:40,000
Please!

583
00:40:43,500 --> 00:40:49,300
Please! Besides you, there's no one else I can ask this question to.

584
00:40:49,300 --> 00:40:50,900
Sun Bo!

585
00:40:50,900 --> 00:40:53,000
I don't know.

586
00:40:56,000 --> 00:40:57,999
Get away!

587
00:40:58,000 --> 00:41:00,000
Just get away!

588
00:41:10,200 --> 00:41:12,630
My heart hurts so much.

589
00:41:13,200 --> 00:41:17,099
My friend is not my friend.

590
00:41:20,300 --> 00:41:21,800
Fine.

591
00:41:23,200 --> 00:41:24,600
Fine!

592
00:41:32,700 --> 00:41:34,750
What is it?

593
00:41:35,700 --> 00:41:37,799
That day...

594
00:41:37,800 --> 00:41:39,840
Which day?

595
00:41:39,840 --> 00:41:42,410
[Young Little White]

596
00:41:45,600 --> 00:41:47,500
Who can understand this?

597
00:42:13,700 --> 00:42:15,799
Your done for the day?

598
00:42:15,800 --> 00:42:17,100
Yeah.

599
00:42:18,700 --> 00:42:20,499
Is Xiang Haoting coming to pick you up?

600
00:42:20,500 --> 00:42:23,900
I told him to use his time to study at home.

601
00:42:33,500 --> 00:42:35,600
Do I have something on my pants?

602
00:42:36,900 --> 00:42:39,499
No, I was thinking about something.

603
00:42:39,500 --> 00:42:42,399
Little Gu, you're taking off?

604
00:42:44,900 --> 00:42:46,799
Didn't you get into a good school already?

605
00:42:46,800 --> 00:42:48,499
Why don't you take on more hours?

606
00:42:48,500 --> 00:42:51,299
I want to help Haoting review his study materials.

607
00:42:51,300 --> 00:42:53,899
Don't forget, you have to start saving for your school fees early.

608
00:42:53,900 --> 00:42:56,320
College tuition is much more than high school tuition.

609
00:42:57,000 --> 00:42:59,700
I know! I've already been planning for it

610
00:43:01,080 --> 00:43:02,900
Then hurry home. You've had a long day today.

611
00:43:02,900 --> 00:43:05,599
Then, I'm going to take off. Brother Chigang, bye-bye.

612
00:43:05,599 --> 00:43:06,500
Bye-bye.

613
00:43:06,501 --> 00:43:09,300
Sun Bo, bye-bye.

614
00:43:09,300 --> 00:43:10,600
Bye-bye.

615
00:43:21,400 --> 00:43:23,866
So tired.

616
00:43:26,600 --> 00:43:28,232
I have something to ask you.

617
00:43:28,233 --> 00:43:29,865
What is it?

618
00:43:31,101 --> 00:43:33,400
You know it was my first time.

619
00:43:34,433 --> 00:43:37,766
So, I was thinking about the day in the shower,

620
00:43:38,533 --> 00:43:40,632
did it hurt?

621
00:43:40,633 --> 00:43:42,400
Did it feel good?

622
00:43:46,033 --> 00:43:47,566
Did it feel good?

623
00:43:55,166 --> 00:43:56,966
It felt good.

624
00:44:02,980 --> 00:44:08,550
♫ I still don’t understand why you left ♫

625
00:44:08,550 --> 00:44:14,600
♫ I still don’t understand why I’m waiting ♫

626
00:44:14,600 --> 00:44:20,350
♫ Waiting for who will remember their responsibility ♫

627
00:44:20,350 --> 00:44:26,050
♫ I’m left at the original place wandering around alone ♫

628
00:44:26,050 --> 00:44:31,440
♫ When the blue sky and white clouds disappear ♫

629
00:44:31,440 --> 00:44:36,860
♫ When you take away the yellow sneakers and the red sweater ♫

630
00:44:36,860 --> 00:44:42,220
♫ When all the colors are gone along with you ♫

631
00:44:42,220 --> 00:44:48,930
♫ Only transparent tears that unceasingly fall accompany me ♫

632
00:44:48,930 --> 00:44:54,360
♫ I still don’t understand why you left ♫

♫ I still don’t understand why I’m waiting ♫

634
00:45:00,350 --> 00:45:06,110
♫ Waiting for who will remember their responsibility ♫

♫ I’m left at the original place wandering around alone ♫

636
00:45:10,530 --> 00:45:15,920
♫ When one story becomes two regrets ♫

637
00:45:15,920 --> 00:45:22,220
♫ Letting two hearts run towards two different futures ♫

638
00:45:22,220 --> 00:45:27,680
♫ All those that can’t be forgotten can only become regrets ♫

639
00:45:27,680 --> 00:45:34,850
♫ But I still can’t understand why the tears won’t stop ♫
