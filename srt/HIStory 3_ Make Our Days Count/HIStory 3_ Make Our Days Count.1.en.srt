[HIStory 3: Make Our Days Count]
[Episode 1]

13
00:01:33,283 --> 00:01:35,749
Gao Chun is starving.

14
00:01:35,750 --> 00:01:39,782
Give me some.

15
00:01:39,783 --> 00:01:40,982
Hurry up!

16
00:01:40,983 --> 00:01:42,415
Are you retarded?

17
00:01:42,416 --> 00:01:43,250
Are you going to let me have some?

18
00:01:43,250 --> 00:01:44,150
Here.

19
00:01:44,151 --> 00:01:45,249
Okay, wait.

20
00:01:45,250 --> 00:01:46,449
Let me give you another one.

21
00:01:46,450 --> 00:01:47,450
Idiot!

22
00:01:47,451 --> 00:01:49,583
There's none left.

23
00:01:50,350 --> 00:01:54,216
Xie Yichen, 28 points.

24
00:01:55,316 --> 00:01:59,350
Jiang Sensen, 38 points.

25
00:02:01,183 --> 00:02:03,682
Xiang Haoting!

26
00:02:03,683 --> 00:02:04,683
Here.

27
00:02:05,316 --> 00:02:08,216
Xiang Haoting's score is...

28
00:02:10,916 --> 00:02:13,416
13 points!

29
00:02:15,416 --> 00:02:17,849
Teacher, is there a mistake with the marks?

30
00:02:17,850 --> 00:02:21,416
I planned on scoring single digits only.

31
00:02:21,980 --> 00:02:23,915
The last exam you clearly got 100%!

32
00:02:23,916 --> 00:02:27,782
This time, with this sort of score, you obviously don't even care about Chinese class!

33
00:02:27,783 --> 00:02:29,682
I thought that since Teacher's Day was almost here,

34
00:02:29,683 --> 00:02:32,180
I wanted to give teacher a present.

35
00:02:32,180 --> 00:02:36,550
Actually, the reason I scored so well last time was because of my sister.

36
00:02:36,550 --> 00:02:39,079
She doesn't do well in school and she always uses me as an excuse.

37
00:02:39,080 --> 00:02:43,216
I thought that since I'm her older brother I should set an example for her.

38
00:02:43,216 --> 00:02:46,283
This is called, teaching by example.

39
00:02:47,283 --> 00:02:49,382
You purposely did so poorly on the exam and you still have excuses?!

40
00:02:49,383 --> 00:02:51,515
Teacher, I really didn't do it on purpose.

41
00:02:51,516 --> 00:02:53,249
You have to believe me.

42
00:02:53,250 --> 00:02:55,715
I really planned everything meticulously.

43
00:02:55,716 --> 00:02:58,449
I'm challenging myself to have the determination to do what I say.

44
00:02:58,449 --> 00:03:00,216
Really.

45
00:03:00,216 --> 00:03:01,749
You're already in your third year,

46
00:03:01,750 --> 00:03:04,150
yet you still have this type of attitude of just trying to have fun every day.

47
00:03:04,150 --> 00:03:05,949
Do you really want to graduate?!

48
00:03:05,950 --> 00:03:08,810
Teacher, this is called freedom.

49
00:03:09,416 --> 00:03:11,415
This is Chinese class, not English class.

50
00:03:11,416 --> 00:03:14,050
Free will.

51
00:03:15,916 --> 00:03:18,016
Just shut up!

52
00:03:19,050 --> 00:03:21,849
As a student, not doing what you're supposed to do.

53
00:03:21,849 --> 00:03:24,215
Not taking studying seriously. What do you mean by freedom?

54
00:03:24,215 --> 00:03:26,182
Freedom?

55
00:03:26,183 --> 00:03:28,516
You think if you don't want to come to class, you can just not attend class?

56
00:03:28,516 --> 00:03:29,283
Can I?

57
00:03:29,284 --> 00:03:32,637
If you have the guts to leave here, then you can!

58
00:03:40,383 --> 00:03:42,016
For freedom.

59
00:03:43,283 --> 00:03:45,382
Freedom!

60
00:03:45,383 --> 00:03:47,049
What are you doing?

61
00:03:47,050 --> 00:03:48,050
Rebelling?

62
00:03:48,051 --> 00:03:50,083
- All of you get back here! Sit down!
- A-hao!

63
00:03:50,083 --> 00:03:51,949
- Buy me something to eat.
- Get back here!

64
00:03:51,950 --> 00:03:54,149
Everyone sit down!

65
00:03:54,150 --> 00:03:55,649
Come back!

66
00:03:55,650 --> 00:03:57,449
Come back soon!

67
00:03:57,450 --> 00:04:00,316
A-hao!

68
00:04:00,316 --> 00:04:02,316
Xiang Haoting!

69
00:04:02,316 --> 00:04:04,949
What freedom?! What free will?!

70
00:04:04,949 --> 00:04:06,315
Don't want to come to class so you don't need to come!

71
00:04:06,316 --> 00:04:07,680
- Such a good impression.
- So much alike.

72
00:04:07,680 --> 00:04:09,315
Show him the video. Quick!

73
00:04:09,316 --> 00:04:11,315
Look. This is the video of A-hao taking off just now.

74
00:04:11,316 --> 00:04:13,115
He looked so cool taking off just now.

75
00:04:13,116 --> 00:04:15,949
He just hopped over another student and then flew out the door.

76
00:04:15,949 --> 00:04:17,915
And everyone came out to cheer him on.

77
00:04:17,916 --> 00:04:20,116
You know what the most important part is? He didn't have to attend class after.

78
00:04:20,116 --> 00:04:22,350
- So awesome.
- So cool!

79
00:04:23,483 --> 00:04:24,316
To freedom.

80
00:04:24,317 --> 00:04:27,615
Freedom!

81
00:04:27,616 --> 00:04:29,650
NT$300 each.
(approx. $10)

82
00:04:29,650 --> 00:04:31,883
You're robbing us?

83
00:04:33,383 --> 00:04:36,516
- Why do we need to pay NT$300?
- I don't know.

84
00:04:37,250 --> 00:04:40,383
Skipping class to buy you fried chicken,

85
00:04:40,383 --> 00:04:42,715
don't you need to pay the delivery fee?

86
00:04:42,716 --> 00:04:44,715
But you ate some, too.

87
00:04:44,716 --> 00:04:47,683
That's right. Besides, you left on your own.

88
00:04:47,683 --> 00:04:50,282
- No one forced you.
- Old Sun is right.

89
00:04:50,283 --> 00:04:51,883
- That's being unreasonable.
- Fatso!

90
00:04:51,884 --> 00:04:54,616
You don't pay, so don't eat.

91
00:04:54,616 --> 00:04:56,979
NT$300 just for your fried chicken?

92
00:04:56,980 --> 00:04:58,382
Have you been low on cash lately?

93
00:04:58,383 --> 00:04:59,582
Just NT$300, should be okay.

94
00:04:59,583 --> 00:05:01,682
You're a rich jerk, what do you know?

95
00:05:01,683 --> 00:05:03,650
Lately, I'm seriously low on cash.

96
00:05:03,650 --> 00:05:06,116
I really want to buy a Switch.

97
00:05:08,216 --> 00:05:10,636
How come there's only a dollar and five dollar coins?

98
00:05:11,283 --> 00:05:14,016
You don't want it? Don't want it? Then give it back

99
00:05:14,716 --> 00:05:16,315
Old Sun really knows how to get him.

100
00:05:16,316 --> 00:05:17,915
Better to have little then nothing at all.

101
00:05:17,916 --> 00:05:19,949
Thank you, Big Brother, for the fried chicken.

102
00:05:19,950 --> 00:05:21,949
Didn't someone say just now NT$300 was not too much?

103
00:05:21,950 --> 00:05:24,149
- Give me NT$500 then.
- That's way too much!

104
00:05:24,149 --> 00:05:26,079
Then, let me help you eat some more.

105
00:05:26,080 --> 00:05:28,616
Is there anyone that hasn't paid yet? This student.

106
00:05:28,616 --> 00:05:32,082
I didn't hear anything you were saying just now. What do you mean?

107
00:05:32,082 --> 00:05:33,782
Gao Xiao-chun, are you looking for a death wish?

108
00:05:33,783 --> 00:05:35,382
- Paying up or not?
- What do you mean?

109
00:05:35,383 --> 00:05:38,315
Fine, I'll pay in a bit.

110
00:05:38,316 --> 00:05:40,183
You said it.

111
00:05:47,783 --> 00:05:49,249
Going to look for trouble again?

112
00:05:49,250 --> 00:05:51,516
- You should be ashamed.
- Oh no.

113
00:05:51,516 --> 00:05:53,016
Girlfriend.

114
00:05:54,050 --> 00:05:55,750
Get lost.

115
00:05:56,850 --> 00:05:59,760
- Take your time!
- Don't bother coming back!

116
00:05:59,760 --> 00:06:02,600
You skipped class again and got yourself hurt, too.

117
00:06:02,600 --> 00:06:05,050
You seriously are something.

118
00:06:05,050 --> 00:06:07,016
Here?

119
00:06:09,980 --> 00:06:12,383
Who jumped the wall and still brought food back?

120
00:06:13,216 --> 00:06:16,416
So impulsive, like a wild horse.

121
00:06:21,083 --> 00:06:23,050
Where else does it hurt?

122
00:06:26,916 --> 00:06:28,783
It hurts really bad right here.

123
00:06:32,116 --> 00:06:33,849
I'm warning you.

124
00:06:33,850 --> 00:06:36,283
Don't do that again next time.

125
00:06:36,283 --> 00:06:38,450
I worry when you get hurt

126
00:07:57,183 --> 00:07:58,883
Pull it closed!

127
00:08:30,716 --> 00:08:32,816
Drink some water.

128
00:08:33,450 --> 00:08:36,531
So, are you feeling better?

129
00:08:37,716 --> 00:08:41,749
After I ate something, I didn't feel sick anymore.

130
00:08:41,749 --> 00:08:45,015
You are always trying to save money by not eating lunch.

131
00:08:45,015 --> 00:08:47,283
If you keep this up, your stomach won't be able to stand it.

132
00:08:47,283 --> 00:08:48,849
It's just sometimes.

133
00:08:48,850 --> 00:08:53,080
Besides, Teacher always gives me some snacks.

134
00:08:55,350 --> 00:09:00,883
You, didn't I tell you before that eating regular meals is important?

135
00:09:03,916 --> 00:09:08,479
Fine. Just remember if you feel sick, don't ignore it.

136
00:09:08,479 --> 00:09:11,416
Get to the hospital and have it looked at, okay?

137
00:09:11,416 --> 00:09:13,083
Thank you, Teacher.

138
00:09:13,083 --> 00:09:15,415
When you're done, get to class.

139
00:09:15,416 --> 00:09:17,850
- I need to get back to work.
- Okay.

140
00:09:25,683 --> 00:09:27,316
Give it to me.

141
00:09:32,250 --> 00:09:34,183
Let's go.

142
00:09:34,183 --> 00:09:37,450
They beat us again in their school ranking.

143
00:09:39,150 --> 00:09:41,783
Yu Shigu got first place again?

144
00:09:41,783 --> 00:09:43,215
Why pay so much attention to him?

145
00:09:43,216 --> 00:09:44,815
He's so good looking!

146
00:09:44,816 --> 00:09:46,979
All of us fujoshi fans secretly take photos of him.
(lit. 'spoiled girls'; a reclaimed Japanese term for female fans who enjoy any media works or fanworks with romantic relationships between men)

147
00:09:46,980 --> 00:09:50,683
We're all die-hard fans of Yu.

148
00:09:52,483 --> 00:09:55,450
Let me show you a couple of photos. He's so good looking.

149
00:09:59,850 --> 00:10:02,950
- This one is edited right?
- Nope.

150
00:10:02,950 --> 00:10:04,816
Perfect angle.

151
00:10:05,716 --> 00:10:08,382
How come he's the only one in the photos.

152
00:10:08,383 --> 00:10:09,749
He doesn't have any friends?

153
00:10:09,750 --> 00:10:11,649
Nope, he's quite an ice-cold loner.

154
00:10:11,650 --> 00:10:14,816
He only studies, studies, and studies.

155
00:10:14,816 --> 00:10:16,783
My love.

156
00:10:17,850 --> 00:10:20,270
Does he have a girlfriend?

157
00:10:20,270 --> 00:10:22,080
Nope.

158
00:10:24,216 --> 00:10:27,383
Just a nerd. Let's go.

159
00:10:28,450 --> 00:10:31,190
Let me show you a few really good-looking shots.

160
00:10:34,583 --> 00:10:36,783
Everyone's full? How was the chicken soup today?

161
00:10:36,783 --> 00:10:38,950
Delicious.

162
00:10:38,950 --> 00:10:41,150
Thanks, Mommy.

163
00:10:41,150 --> 00:10:43,249
You all are so in sync.

164
00:10:43,250 --> 00:10:45,082
I'm happy as long as you all like it.

165
00:10:45,083 --> 00:10:47,716
Okay, let me go prepare some fruit.

166
00:10:49,950 --> 00:10:54,150
Ching-ching, eat more broccoli. Don't let him eat it all.

167
00:10:54,150 --> 00:10:55,716
I know.

168
00:10:58,416 --> 00:11:00,415
Why did you eat so slowly today?

169
00:11:00,416 --> 00:11:01,933
You have a toothache?

170
00:11:01,934 --> 00:11:06,950
- No, I saw on TV that if you chew slowly it helps digestion.
- No way.

171
00:11:06,950 --> 00:11:09,882
Hello, Uncle Huang.

172
00:11:09,883 --> 00:11:13,615
I know, I remember everything that you told me.

173
00:11:13,700 --> 00:11:15,600
Neighbor's problems are my problems.

174
00:11:15,700 --> 00:11:18,900
Don't you worry. I will be sure to handle the situation for you, okay?

175
00:11:20,383 --> 00:11:22,649
I'll help you call them in a bit to find out, okay?

176
00:11:22,649 --> 00:11:25,183
What are you scheming now?

177
00:11:26,916 --> 00:11:30,316
Nothing. Finish the chicken soup for me.

178
00:11:37,250 --> 00:11:39,182
What's the stupid smile for?

179
00:11:39,183 --> 00:11:43,250
Mommy, can I get an advance on my allowance?

180
00:11:43,250 --> 00:11:45,501
NT$3,000 is in the drawer, go get it yourself.
(approx. $100)

181
00:11:45,502 --> 00:11:48,415
NT$3,000 isn't enough. I need a half year's allowance.

182
00:11:48,415 --> 00:11:50,449
What do you need so much money for?

183
00:11:50,450 --> 00:11:52,016
Keep it down. I want to buy a Switch.
(T/N: Nintendo Switch, the latest gaming hybrid console; stationary and portable device.)

184
00:11:52,016 --> 00:11:54,510
Switch? You really…

185
00:11:55,683 --> 00:11:58,550
Don't waste your money.

186
00:11:58,550 --> 00:11:59,979
I really want to buy it, I've been wanting to for a long time.

187
00:11:59,980 --> 00:12:01,315
That's really expensive.

188
00:12:01,316 --> 00:12:04,049
- Don't be so reckless.
- Keep it down.

189
00:12:04,050 --> 00:12:08,010
Xiang Haoting, what are you doing now?

190
00:12:08,010 --> 00:12:10,083
He wants to buy a Switch.

191
00:12:11,750 --> 00:12:14,681
You got such poor marks this time, and you still want to buy a game console?

192
00:12:14,682 --> 00:12:18,715
Dad, getting poor marks and wanting to buy a game console are two completely different things.

193
00:12:18,715 --> 00:12:20,182
Neither are related, okay?

194
00:12:20,183 --> 00:12:22,882
You need to consider the matters by themselves, don't just stand there.

195
00:12:22,882 --> 00:12:24,315
Completely different matter, my butt!

196
00:12:24,316 --> 00:12:27,482
Without a game console, you managed to score second from last of all third year students.

197
00:12:27,483 --> 00:12:29,250
Imagine if I let you buy it?

198
00:12:29,250 --> 00:12:32,582
I bet you probably wouldn't even go to school. You wouldn't even get last place.

199
00:12:32,582 --> 00:12:34,980
How about if I borrow from you then?

200
00:12:34,980 --> 00:12:37,882
Whether you want me to do housework, or run errands, or anything is fine.

201
00:12:37,882 --> 00:12:39,415
Mommy, I can help you with community work.

202
00:12:39,416 --> 00:12:40,682
You want to help me with community work?

203
00:12:40,683 --> 00:12:44,149
No way. He's a third year student; he needs to study!

204
00:12:44,150 --> 00:12:46,582
Why do you always have to block my means to wealth?

205
00:12:46,583 --> 00:12:48,950
I'm borrowing from Mommy and not you!

206
00:12:48,950 --> 00:12:50,549
So strange. It's the same thing every single time.

207
00:12:50,550 --> 00:12:52,750
So annoying!

208
00:12:52,750 --> 00:12:57,651
- Fine then, I can give you a half years allowance.
- Really?

209
00:12:57,651 --> 00:12:59,749
As long as you promise on the remaining exams

210
00:12:59,750 --> 00:13:03,582
that you do as well as you did in your second year and score in the top three of your school.

211
00:13:05,200 --> 00:13:07,800
That's enough. Let's eat fruit.

212
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:11,600
This time, I'm only willing to sell my body but I won't sell my brain.

213
00:13:11,715 --> 00:13:14,200
A scholar prefers death rather than humiliation!

214
00:13:14,516 --> 00:13:16,200
What are you talking about?

215
00:13:16,650 --> 00:13:20,211
Is asking you to do better on exams, insulting you?

216
00:13:20,211 --> 00:13:22,716
You think you can get into university with your grades?

217
00:13:23,916 --> 00:13:27,416
What are you going to do in the future? Say it again.

218
00:13:27,416 --> 00:13:29,916
I said it already. Why do I need to say it a second time?

219
00:13:29,916 --> 00:13:31,690
I can't hear you.

220
00:13:31,690 --> 00:13:33,600
Come here.

221
00:13:35,750 --> 00:13:38,716
I should give you a beating to see if I can't knock some sense into you!

222
00:13:39,450 --> 00:13:41,116
Open the door, Xiang Haoting!

223
00:13:41,116 --> 00:13:44,515
- I don't want to, I don't want to! 
- Our little sister is still the best. Here.

224
00:13:44,516 --> 00:13:46,249
Here's the money for doing the housework.

225
00:13:46,250 --> 00:13:48,050
- Love you.
- I love you, too.

226
00:13:48,050 --> 00:13:51,670
- Xiang Haoting!
- What did you say? I can't hear you!

227
00:13:51,670 --> 00:13:53,980
If they don't want to eat it, more for us.

228
00:13:53,983 --> 00:13:56,250
They argue once every three hours.

229
00:13:56,250 --> 00:13:59,816
- Incredible.
- Get used to it.

230
00:14:12,980 --> 00:14:16,850
♫ Come on, wake up ♫

231
00:14:16,850 --> 00:14:21,410
♫ The world is as you see ♫

232
00:14:23,140 --> 00:14:26,740
♫ There's no excuse ♫

233
00:14:26,740 --> 00:14:31,280
♫ You know it's all inside of you ♫

234
00:14:32,130 --> 00:14:36,983
♫ Turn to me. Come to me. Is any way you know... ♫

235
00:14:36,983 --> 00:14:38,580
What are you doing?

236
00:14:41,583 --> 00:14:42,849
What are you doing?

237
00:14:42,850 --> 00:14:44,782
I should be asking you, what you're doing?

238
00:14:44,783 --> 00:14:48,282
I run an upfront operation and you're taking sneak photos.

239
00:14:48,300 --> 00:14:50,400
I'm not taking sneak photos.

240
00:14:50,450 --> 00:14:51,782
I didn't even get the shot.

241
00:14:51,783 --> 00:14:53,549
If you did get it, I'd be in worse trouble.

242
00:14:53,550 --> 00:14:55,349
No one would dare come to the gym to work out anymore.

243
00:14:55,350 --> 00:14:56,845
Don't exaggerate.

244
00:14:56,846 --> 00:14:59,949
Listen kid, I asked you to maintain the machines here,

245
00:14:59,950 --> 00:15:03,249
but you and your inappropriate thoughts; taking sneak photos?

246
00:15:03,249 --> 00:15:05,411
- Let me see who you took photos of?
- No!

247
00:15:05,411 --> 00:15:07,715
- Let me see.
- No!

248
00:15:07,716 --> 00:15:09,350
What's the matter?

249
00:15:09,350 --> 00:15:11,084
You're fighting again?

250
00:15:11,085 --> 00:15:16,231
It's nothing, I caught him taking sneak photos right here.

251
00:15:16,232 --> 00:15:17,738
Don't talk nonsense.

252
00:15:17,739 --> 00:15:22,113
I'm not. I saw you taking pictures of Little Gang with my own eyes, didn't you?

253
00:15:22,113 --> 00:15:23,715
Which eye did you see me sneaking photos?

254
00:15:23,716 --> 00:15:27,610
My left, my right, both my eyes.

255
00:15:28,783 --> 00:15:32,080
You took photos of me? Let me see.

256
00:15:35,716 --> 00:15:39,616
Talking nonsense again! Trying to get me in trouble again.

257
00:15:39,616 --> 00:15:42,283
- He did take photos.
- I didn't.

258
00:15:42,283 --> 00:15:45,415
I was merely trying to help you record members progress.

259
00:15:45,416 --> 00:15:47,620
Record what progress?

260
00:15:47,621 --> 00:15:51,582
All the members-- You see, he's had some progress.

261
00:15:51,583 --> 00:15:54,580
Little Gang? Not much has changed.

262
00:15:54,580 --> 00:15:56,550
Here, let me take a look.

263
00:15:57,650 --> 00:16:00,149
Yes, you did! You've been secretly training.

264
00:16:00,150 --> 00:16:03,582
Manager, if you keep this up, I'm going to return my membership.

265
00:16:03,582 --> 00:16:06,615
Don't do that. What do you have that I haven't seen already?

266
00:16:06,615 --> 00:16:10,550
I've even seen that limb called your calf.

267
00:16:21,550 --> 00:16:23,350
Are you okay?

268
00:16:26,516 --> 00:16:29,316
Why are you sweating so much all of a sudden?

269
00:16:36,316 --> 00:16:39,082
Little Gang, we just got some new whey protein at the office.

270
00:16:39,082 --> 00:16:40,650
- You want to try some?
- Sure.

271
00:16:40,651 --> 00:16:42,282
The brand you recommended last time was pretty good.

272
00:16:42,283 --> 00:16:44,651
- Right.
- I just ran out but let me tell you,

273
00:16:44,651 --> 00:16:46,182
I don't want any chocolate flavored ones.

274
00:16:46,183 --> 00:16:48,350
Okay, then strawberry.

275
00:17:02,316 --> 00:17:05,283
Little Gu, it's time to go home; it's time to close up.

276
00:17:05,284 --> 00:17:07,315
I'll stock the inventory before heading home.

277
00:17:07,316 --> 00:17:09,150
It's okay. You're in your third year of high school.

278
00:17:09,150 --> 00:17:12,117
You need to get more rest so that you can study better.

279
00:17:12,117 --> 00:17:16,082
More importantly, you need to stock up on energy.

280
00:17:16,082 --> 00:17:17,950
Did you eat dinner yet?

281
00:17:18,650 --> 00:17:19,682
I ate today already.

282
00:17:19,683 --> 00:17:21,882
Looking at you, I know you didn't eat.

283
00:17:21,883 --> 00:17:24,350
Listen to me, okay?

284
00:17:31,316 --> 00:17:32,616
You need to eat it all.

285
00:17:32,616 --> 00:17:34,416
Thanks, Brother Chigang.

286
00:17:38,416 --> 00:17:41,616
Yu Shigu, wait for me. Yu Shigu.

287
00:17:41,616 --> 00:17:43,860
Can you tutor me at math?

288
00:17:43,860 --> 00:17:46,016
I don't have time.

289
00:17:46,016 --> 00:17:47,816
How can you not have time?

290
00:17:47,816 --> 00:17:50,650
You don't leave the school even after school.

291
00:17:50,650 --> 00:17:53,516
I don't stay every day.

292
00:17:53,516 --> 00:17:54,649
I've been watching you.

293
00:17:54,650 --> 00:17:57,650
You stay at school two days out of the week.

294
00:17:59,416 --> 00:18:01,315
I have my own study schedule to keep.

295
00:18:01,316 --> 00:18:03,180
I don't want to disrupt it.

296
00:18:03,180 --> 00:18:05,030
But–

297
00:18:05,030 --> 00:18:06,910
Damn!

298
00:18:19,450 --> 00:18:21,183
Thank you.

299
00:18:27,816 --> 00:18:29,810
What the…

300
00:18:32,010 --> 00:18:36,100
What the heck! Why is no one paying attention to me?

301
00:18:37,951 --> 00:18:39,615
You all don't believe me.

302
00:18:39,616 --> 00:18:42,883
- Yours is better than mine.
- Right. Go buy some.

303
00:18:43,483 --> 00:18:45,630
Are any of you listening?

304
00:18:46,683 --> 00:18:48,483
Old Sun!

305
00:18:49,350 --> 00:18:51,950
I saw them with my own eyes.

306
00:18:51,950 --> 00:18:55,349
So, Yu Shigu is trying to steal Li Shiyu, or is Li Shiyu trying to steal Yu Shigu?

307
00:18:55,350 --> 00:18:57,783
Of course, it's Yu Shigu.

308
00:18:58,516 --> 00:19:01,783
Your fellow student, is that okay?

309
00:19:02,550 --> 00:19:03,749
Do you have pictures?

310
00:19:03,750 --> 00:19:06,316
- Didn't you not believe me just now.
- Is this for real?

311
00:19:07,350 --> 00:19:09,549
Your girlfriend is hugging someone else.

312
00:19:09,550 --> 00:19:11,150
Are you seeing this?

313
00:19:12,450 --> 00:19:15,549
A-hao, you let someone else hug your girlfriend?

314
00:19:16,183 --> 00:19:18,959
- Who?
- Yu Shigu!

315
00:19:18,960 --> 00:19:20,749
Who is he?

316
00:19:20,750 --> 00:19:23,416
That "study machine."

317
00:19:23,416 --> 00:19:25,979
- I don't know him.
- You really don't care.

318
00:19:25,980 --> 00:19:28,180
They held each other like this.

319
00:19:28,180 --> 00:19:30,082
Let me tell you, it's not like this.

320
00:19:30,083 --> 00:19:32,750
They first held each other like this.

321
00:19:34,683 --> 00:19:36,516
Then like this.

322
00:19:37,416 --> 00:19:40,406
- Shigu.
- Shiyu.

323
00:19:40,406 --> 00:19:42,151
So romantic!

324
00:19:42,151 --> 00:19:45,149
- Shigu.
- Shiyu.
- You really don't care?

325
00:19:45,150 --> 00:19:46,582
Hey, you guys are crazy.

326
00:19:46,583 --> 00:19:48,049
They couldn't have been like that.

327
00:19:48,050 --> 00:19:49,916
There must have been a reason.

328
00:19:51,650 --> 00:19:54,782
I'm your brother! You still won't believe me.

329
00:19:56,816 --> 00:19:59,250
She wouldn't like him.

330
00:19:59,250 --> 00:20:00,980
I'm going to sleep.

331
00:20:02,016 --> 00:20:05,430
A-hao, don't you even care?

332
00:20:05,430 --> 00:20:06,883
Okay, forget it.

333
00:20:06,883 --> 00:20:09,115
The only thing on his mind now is Switch.

334
00:20:09,116 --> 00:20:11,382
You can't just let it go like this.

335
00:20:11,383 --> 00:20:12,849
Us brothers need to think of something.

336
00:20:12,850 --> 00:20:15,160
It's his girlfriend. You don't need to care so much.

337
00:20:15,160 --> 00:20:17,010
Old Sun!

338
00:20:17,010 --> 00:20:20,083
Fine. Let's talk about it later, okay?

339
00:20:32,283 --> 00:20:34,183
You again.

340
00:20:34,183 --> 00:20:37,383
Interrupted me last time and now stealing my bed.

341
00:20:37,383 --> 00:20:39,083
Such bad luck.

342
00:21:09,616 --> 00:21:11,310
Xiang Haoting.

343
00:21:18,250 --> 00:21:19,783
Come here!

344
00:21:21,016 --> 00:21:22,950
Stand up!

345
00:21:22,950 --> 00:21:25,149
Why are you bothering another student that's sleeping?

346
00:21:25,150 --> 00:21:27,583
I want to sleep, too.

347
00:21:28,980 --> 00:21:30,883
What's wrong with you?

348
00:21:30,883 --> 00:21:33,249
Me... I'm feeling exhausted.

349
00:21:33,250 --> 00:21:34,949
Feeling exhausted? Get back to class and sleep on your desk!

350
00:21:34,950 --> 00:21:36,249
If you hadn't distubed me, I'd already be sleeping.

351
00:21:36,250 --> 00:21:37,649
Don't try to talk your way out of it.

352
00:21:37,650 --> 00:21:40,883
Come outside with me. Get out here!

353
00:21:48,283 --> 00:21:53,682
Bye? Think about it? All the good spots will be taken!

354
00:21:53,683 --> 00:21:54,970
Fine.

355
00:21:54,970 --> 00:21:59,210
Fine and you're still walking. Hurry up!

356
00:22:00,116 --> 00:22:03,816
- Yu Shigu, bye-bye.
- Hurry up.

357
00:22:09,950 --> 00:22:12,550
Yu Shigu, why are you still here?

358
00:22:12,550 --> 00:22:14,716
Wait for me a sec.

359
00:22:14,716 --> 00:22:16,282
Why should we wait for you?

360
00:22:16,283 --> 00:22:19,549
It's after school. Don't become a hassle for everyone.

361
00:22:19,549 --> 00:22:20,949
You guys are interrupting me

362
00:22:20,950 --> 00:22:22,682
and will make my half hour even longer.

363
00:22:22,683 --> 00:22:24,549
So what if you're so good at studying. Big deal!

364
00:22:24,550 --> 00:22:26,450
- You get to do what you want.
- Forget it, En.

365
00:22:26,451 --> 00:22:27,749
Forget what?

366
00:22:27,750 --> 00:22:29,682
If he wants to do homework, he should go home and do it.

367
00:22:29,683 --> 00:22:31,315
Why do it here? Who is he trying to impress?

368
00:22:31,316 --> 00:22:33,483
Showing off.

369
00:22:37,483 --> 00:22:39,382
Wasting my time.

370
00:22:39,383 --> 00:22:41,680
Can't you just leave earlier.

371
00:22:49,783 --> 00:22:51,849
Wait! Did you see the eyebrows?

372
00:22:51,850 --> 00:22:54,382
- His eyebrows are so thick.
- It's ridiculous.

373
00:22:54,383 --> 00:22:56,516
I've never seen such ugly…

374
00:23:08,950 --> 00:23:11,783
Mr. Xiang didn't pick you up today?

375
00:23:12,650 --> 00:23:15,516
I haven't seen much of him lately.

376
00:23:17,050 --> 00:23:18,883
You guys are fighting?

377
00:23:19,516 --> 00:23:21,616
How come?

378
00:23:22,916 --> 00:23:25,516
It wouldn't be because of Yu Baby, could it?

379
00:23:29,216 --> 00:23:32,949
What's wrong? Mr. Xiang is really perfect.

380
00:23:32,950 --> 00:23:35,583
What's being handsome good for anyway?

381
00:23:35,583 --> 00:23:38,350
Like a sugar cane; sweet at first, then you're left with the flavorless pulp at the end.

382
00:23:43,350 --> 00:23:45,715
After thinking about it, Yu Shigu is much better.

383
00:23:45,716 --> 00:23:47,149
He's good looking and smart.

384
00:23:47,150 --> 00:23:49,349
He'll get into a national university for sure.

385
00:23:49,350 --> 00:23:51,182
You're already thinking about the future?

386
00:23:51,183 --> 00:23:53,349
If I want to get into the top three schools,

387
00:23:53,350 --> 00:23:55,887
wanting a boyfriend from a national university is normal. Is it not?

388
00:23:55,888 --> 00:23:58,150
That's true.

389
00:24:02,750 --> 00:24:04,450
What are you doing?

390
00:24:05,010 --> 00:24:07,550
Getting into a national university isn't a bad idea.

391
00:24:08,516 --> 00:24:10,816
You really are an idiot.

392
00:24:13,950 --> 00:24:15,182
What are you doing?

393
00:24:15,183 --> 00:24:17,282
She's already in a bad mood.

394
00:24:17,283 --> 00:24:19,482
What? Is studying idiotic?

395
00:24:19,483 --> 00:24:21,010
It's you that's an idiot.

396
00:24:21,950 --> 00:24:24,150
It's-- What--

397
00:24:24,150 --> 00:24:26,510
You really don't think I can get in?

398
00:25:22,550 --> 00:25:24,150
Thank you, Mommy.

399
00:25:24,150 --> 00:25:25,740
You really are a genius.

400
00:25:25,750 --> 00:25:28,749
All for your beloved Switch, you really did give your all.

401
00:25:28,750 --> 00:25:31,682
You ran errands for our community members to make the extra money,

402
00:25:31,683 --> 00:25:34,282
and even handed out flyers on the weekends.

403
00:25:34,283 --> 00:25:36,316
Not even two weeks, and you made all this money.

404
00:25:36,317 --> 00:25:39,723
I'm telling you! This attitude of yours is just like your mom.

405
00:25:39,723 --> 00:25:42,182
Recalling back then,

406
00:25:42,183 --> 00:25:45,749
I did my best to stand out from all of your dad's die-hard fans.

407
00:25:45,750 --> 00:25:48,182
I gave my youth and prime years

408
00:25:48,183 --> 00:25:49,917
in order to get a good husband for myself.

409
00:25:49,917 --> 00:25:54,482
- Hub-- Hubby, Hubby, Hubby.
- Good genes!

410
00:25:54,483 --> 00:25:55,350
You're even better than me.

411
00:25:55,351 --> 00:25:57,360
Isn't that right, Hubby?

412
00:25:57,360 --> 00:25:59,110
That's right.

413
00:26:01,916 --> 00:26:04,283
If you used that effort on your studies,

414
00:26:04,283 --> 00:26:06,549
ten Switches, I, your dad would buy for you.

415
00:26:06,550 --> 00:26:08,716
Did you hear that?

416
00:26:08,716 --> 00:26:12,615
Dad, I feel that one shouldn't be so greedy.

417
00:26:12,616 --> 00:26:16,816
You only have two hands to play, one Switch is enough.

418
00:26:16,816 --> 00:26:20,215
You-- I'm just speaking metaphorically; I'm making fun of you.

419
00:26:20,215 --> 00:26:23,010
Turning it around and preaching to me "people shouldn't be too greedy." Are you being serious?

420
00:26:23,010 --> 00:26:24,615
Okay, Daddy, don't be angry.

421
00:26:24,616 --> 00:26:26,315
You're most handsome when you're not angry.

422
00:26:26,316 --> 00:26:30,082
Xiang Haoting, how much did you say you made handing out flyers?

423
00:26:30,083 --> 00:26:32,950
NT$1,000. Why? Do you want to, too?
(approx. $33)

424
00:26:32,951 --> 00:26:36,849
No, but that doesn't seem right.

425
00:26:36,850 --> 00:26:41,049
It's not even two weeks, how can you make NT$18,000?
(approx. $590)

426
00:26:46,650 --> 00:26:48,883
Dad, phone call.

427
00:26:50,010 --> 00:26:51,979
It's your teacher calling.

428
00:26:51,980 --> 00:26:54,315
What trouble did you get into now?

429
00:26:54,316 --> 00:26:57,250
- Let's find out.
- Hello, Teacher.

430
00:27:04,083 --> 00:27:05,549
Then, I'll be extra careful.

431
00:27:05,550 --> 00:27:09,380
Yes, I'm very sorry, Teacher. I guarantee this won't ever happen again.

432
00:27:09,380 --> 00:27:10,850
Yes.

433
00:27:10,850 --> 00:27:13,150
Thank you, Teacher. Goodbye.

434
00:27:15,683 --> 00:27:17,416
Let me have it.

435
00:27:19,050 --> 00:27:20,549
I know you need to let it out.

436
00:27:20,550 --> 00:27:23,515
In the last two weeks, you skipped three days of classes.

437
00:27:23,516 --> 00:27:25,282
Just to buy your Switch, you skipped classes!

438
00:27:25,283 --> 00:27:27,683
If you keep this up, how can you get into university?

439
00:27:27,683 --> 00:27:30,250
Where did you go off to?

440
00:27:30,250 --> 00:27:31,949
Watch me beat some sense into you.

441
00:27:31,950 --> 00:27:33,716
Come on!

442
00:27:37,950 --> 00:27:39,950
Missed me!

443
00:27:39,950 --> 00:27:42,883
Xiang Yongching, block for me!

444
00:27:45,883 --> 00:27:47,583
You're too old.

445
00:27:48,916 --> 00:27:51,683
- Can't get me.
- Okay, stop. Quiet!

446
00:27:51,684 --> 00:27:53,815
Both of you, be good. Okay?

447
00:27:53,816 --> 00:27:55,660
- Love Mommy the best.
- You--

448
00:27:57,583 --> 00:28:00,180
Xiang Haoting, what are you doing?

449
00:28:01,183 --> 00:28:02,616
- Look at him.
- I know.

450
00:28:02,617 --> 00:28:07,010
Forget it! Don't get angry. Sit down.

451
00:28:07,010 --> 00:28:07,984
Is he studying at all?

452
00:28:07,984 --> 00:28:12,050
Seriously! He just infuriates me, I'll go scold him later.

- It's really, Yu Shigu.

456
00:28:46,583 --> 00:28:48,983
What are you doing here?

457
00:28:49,583 --> 00:28:50,782
I'm going to class.

458
00:28:50,783 --> 00:28:53,979
Then, can you help carry these to the gym?

459
00:28:53,980 --> 00:28:55,816
Move them yourself.

460
00:28:55,816 --> 00:28:58,882
Hurry, class is starting. Just help me, okay?

461
00:28:58,883 --> 00:29:01,150
Please.

462
00:29:01,150 --> 00:29:03,583
Hurry!

463
00:29:03,583 --> 00:29:05,883
He really did, just like that.

464
00:29:07,980 --> 00:29:10,780
You guys are already into the second lesson?

465
00:29:12,783 --> 00:29:14,649
But I fell asleep during class,

466
00:29:14,650 --> 00:29:17,550
can you tutor me a little?

467
00:29:19,283 --> 00:29:20,850
Please.

468
00:29:22,183 --> 00:29:23,850
This, this.

469
00:29:25,116 --> 00:29:27,082
- Did you do your homework?
- What homework?

470
00:29:27,083 --> 00:29:29,150
Let's play ball.

471
00:29:31,150 --> 00:29:32,515
What is he trying to do?

472
00:29:32,516 --> 00:29:34,816
Take a picture. That's too much.

473
00:29:35,483 --> 00:29:38,616
- What time is it now?
- They're holding hands.

474
00:29:38,616 --> 00:29:40,482
- 4:00.
- Hugging, and then holding hands.

475
00:29:40,483 --> 00:29:41,849
You should tell him.

476
00:29:41,850 --> 00:29:43,149
Maybe, it's just a misunderstanding?

477
00:29:43,150 --> 00:29:45,750
It's not a misunderstanding. He's trying to steal A-hao's girlfriend.

478
00:29:45,750 --> 00:29:47,816
Let's go.

479

I can't believe it.

480

He gave you his jacket so quickly?

00:29:55,716 --> 00:29:59,583
I don't know why either. I told him I was feeling a bit cold, and he just lent it to me.

482
00:30:00,483 --> 00:30:03,800
Yu Baby's jacket. My heart's broken.

483
00:30:03,800 --> 00:30:05,880
Crying.

484
00:30:05,883 --> 00:30:08,916
I'm so envious. It must be so nice to be beautiful and have good grades.

485
00:30:08,916 --> 00:30:11,515
Both the school's top two "husbands" are yours.

486
00:30:11,516 --> 00:30:12,949
The pictures you took are out of focus.

487
00:30:12,950 --> 00:30:16,010
- Are they?
- I'll take them myself.

488
00:30:16,010 --> 00:30:19,616
You're not planning to post them, are you?

489
00:30:19,616 --> 00:30:20,517
That's right.

490
00:30:20,517 --> 00:30:23,009
You're not afraid that your Mr. Xiang will explode?

491
00:30:23,010 --> 00:30:24,749
If he explodes, he explodes.

492
00:30:24,750 --> 00:30:26,316
I want him to explode.

493
00:30:26,316 --> 00:30:29,382
Don't post it. So many girls are fans of Yu Baby.

494
00:30:29,383 --> 00:30:31,149
You think I'm afraid of them?

495
00:30:31,150 --> 00:30:34,416
He's in such high demand.

496
00:30:34,416 --> 00:30:36,516
Then let's take a photo together.

497
00:30:36,516 --> 00:30:37,979
Yu Baby's jacket.

498
00:30:37,980 --> 00:30:39,249
Let's do one of those three consecutive shots.

499
00:30:39,250 --> 00:30:41,650
Okay, here.

500
00:30:43,416 --> 00:30:45,260
A handsome pose.

501
00:30:45,260 --> 00:30:47,410
Will Yu Baby see it?

502
00:30:51,750 --> 00:30:55,482
Here. Good looking guy playing with flowers.

503
00:30:55,483 --> 00:30:57,583
The lighting is really good here. Help me take a picture, too.

504
00:30:57,583 --> 00:30:59,743
I got a really handsome one of you.

505
00:31:03,450 --> 00:31:05,616
They want to ask you something.

506
00:31:09,283 --> 00:31:11,116
What do you want with me?

507
00:31:12,183 --> 00:31:14,216
What do you mean by this?

508
00:31:16,250 --> 00:31:17,382
I don't know what you're asking.

509
00:31:17,383 --> 00:31:18,549
What are you so arrogant about?

510
00:31:18,550 --> 00:31:20,516
Don't you know what giving your jacket to a girl means?

511
00:31:20,517 --> 00:31:22,082
I'm not stealing Xiang Haoting's girlfriend.

512
00:31:22,083 --> 00:31:24,782
I'm warning you. Don't hang around with Li Shiyu.

513
00:31:24,782 --> 00:31:25,583
You watch yourself.

514
00:31:25,584 --> 00:31:28,250
You should go tell Li Shiyu the same thing.

515
00:31:28,250 --> 00:31:29,979
Xia En, calm down!

516
00:31:29,980 --> 00:31:31,215
What are you doing protecting him?

517
00:31:31,216 --> 00:31:33,715
Li Shiyu is Xiang Haoting's girlfriend.

518
00:31:33,716 --> 00:31:35,616
If you don't want to cause a misunderstanding,

519
00:31:35,616 --> 00:31:38,051
- then stop being in contact with her.
- Say something!

520
00:31:38,051 --> 00:31:40,050
I just told you already!

521
00:31:40,050 --> 00:31:42,383
You should go talk to Li Shiyu.

522
00:31:43,350 --> 00:31:45,150
Big Brother.

523
00:31:45,150 --> 00:31:46,815
- Xia En! Xia En!
- What did you just say?

524
00:31:46,816 --> 00:31:47,716
What kind of attitude is that?

525
00:31:47,717 --> 00:31:50,009
Let's go. That's enough. Why did you hit him?

526
00:31:50,010 --> 00:31:51,183
- You watch yourself.
- Let's go!

527
00:31:51,184 --> 00:31:52,615
Touch my brother's girlfriend?

528
00:31:52,616 --> 00:31:55,816
- Keep your mouth shut.
- Gao Chun.
- Let's go!

529
00:32:15,916 --> 00:32:18,815
After subtracting the two formulas, you'll get 5A+B equals 4.

530
00:32:18,816 --> 00:32:19,750
This is formula five.

531
00:32:19,751 --> 00:32:20,782
Then keep subtracting as you work down--

532
00:32:20,783 --> 00:32:22,580
Reporting.

533
00:32:24,150 --> 00:32:25,979
Why are you so late for class?

534
00:32:25,980 --> 00:32:29,150
Teacher, I'm sorry. My stomach hurt.

535
00:32:29,150 --> 00:32:30,882
Hurry up to your seat and sit down.

536
00:32:30,883 --> 00:32:32,450
Thank you, Teacher.

537
00:32:32,450 --> 00:32:35,016
As we were saying, 5A--

538
00:32:37,050 --> 00:32:38,710
Are you really all right?

539
00:32:38,710 --> 00:32:40,480
I'm fine, really.

540
00:32:41,583 --> 00:32:43,850
Hurry up and get to your seat.

541
00:32:51,383 --> 00:32:53,415
Okay, as I was saying, this formula five...

542
00:32:53,416 --> 00:32:55,749
If we subtract it from formula four,

543
00:32:55,750 --> 00:32:59,410
we'll be able to find A plus B.

544
00:33:05,316 --> 00:33:07,116
Teacher Huang.

545
00:33:08,010 --> 00:33:10,616
Can you please not report me as skipping class?

546
00:33:11,650 --> 00:33:14,216
You want me to not note that you skipped class?

547
00:33:15,183 --> 00:33:16,415
I can't miss class.

548
00:33:16,416 --> 00:33:19,216
I really need to get that scholarship.

549
00:33:19,216 --> 00:33:21,549
You knew that I was already halfway through the class before you came in.

550
00:33:21,550 --> 00:33:23,482
According to the rules, that counts as a skipped class.

551
00:33:23,483 --> 00:33:25,782
Teacher, I really wasn't late on purpose.

552
00:33:25,783 --> 00:33:27,215
Can you just make an exception this time?

553
00:33:27,216 --> 00:33:28,949
You're really putting me in a difficult position.

554
00:33:28,950 --> 00:33:30,949
When you came in just now, everyone saw you.

555
00:33:30,950 --> 00:33:33,650
if I don't report it, wouldn't it be unfair?

556
00:33:38,650 --> 00:33:41,083
But I really need to get that scholarship.

557
00:33:45,416 --> 00:33:47,649
Then, how about telling me why you were late.

558
00:33:47,650 --> 00:33:51,110
I'll be the judge of whether I need to report your absence or not.

559
00:33:51,110 --> 00:33:52,550
I--

560
00:34:02,616 --> 00:34:05,949
- You're so awesome.
- You've really got balls.

561
00:34:05,950 --> 00:34:08,215
- Skipping class to make money.
- Super tiring.

562
00:34:08,216 --> 00:34:10,215
I'm working during the day, working the night shift at night,

563
00:34:10,216 --> 00:34:12,249
handing out flyers on the weekend.

564
00:34:12,250 --> 00:34:13,715
All this and your mom didn't even notice?

565
00:34:13,716 --> 00:34:15,120
For Switch.

566
00:34:15,120 --> 00:34:17,840
- Switch.
- If you bought a Switch,

567
00:34:17,850 --> 00:34:19,690
what games do you want to play?

568
00:34:20,850 --> 00:34:22,715
We'll go pick them out after class.

569
00:34:22,716 --> 00:34:24,582
This money should be enough for each of you to pick a game.

570
00:34:24,583 --> 00:34:27,945
- Brother!
- Brother! I want the Legend of Zelda.

571
00:34:27,946 --> 00:34:31,782
- Super Smash Brothers!
- We can play together.

572
00:34:31,783 --> 00:34:34,050
- Listen to me!
- Old Sun.

573
00:34:34,050 --> 00:34:36,710
Boxiang, Xia En, Gao Chun.

574
00:34:36,717 --> 00:34:39,150
The school instructor is looking for you guys.

575
00:34:39,150 --> 00:34:41,080
What's the matter?

576
00:34:41,080 --> 00:34:43,110
Why?

577
00:34:43,110 --> 00:34:44,950
Xiang Haoting!

578
00:34:47,483 --> 00:34:48,979
Haven't you gone too far?

579
00:34:48,980 --> 00:34:52,649
I was just getting a little close to Yu Shigu, did you really need to hit him?

580
00:34:52,650 --> 00:34:53,516
I didn't.

581
00:34:53,517 --> 00:34:55,482
Why did you ask Xia En and Xia De to hit him?

582
00:34:55,483 --> 00:34:57,115
I didn't.

583
00:34:57,116 --> 00:34:58,515
They all listen to you and support you.

584
00:34:58,516 --> 00:35:00,282
The school instructor already asked for them.

585
00:35:00,283 --> 00:35:03,215
No matter how much you like me, you have no right to tell me who I can and can't be friends with.

586
00:35:03,215 --> 00:35:05,009
What exactly are you talking about?

587
00:35:05,010 --> 00:35:06,846
If I did it, I would admit it. If I didn't do it, I didn't.

588
00:35:06,846 --> 00:35:10,746
You-- You already know I don't like it when people wrongly accuse me of something!

589
00:35:13,816 --> 00:35:16,950
Fine, then let's say you didn't do it.

590
00:35:16,950 --> 00:35:19,749
Then you should at least reflect on yourself and how you've treated me lately.

591
00:35:19,750 --> 00:35:22,010
What do I need to reflect about?

592
00:35:22,010 --> 00:35:24,716
Do you still consider me your girlfriend?

593
00:35:27,616 --> 00:35:29,510
What do you think?

594
00:35:32,750 --> 00:35:35,416
I think I'm starting to like Yu Shigu.

595
00:36:00,050 --> 00:36:02,716
Sweep it and they keep falling.

596
00:36:02,716 --> 00:36:05,550
How are we going to finish this yard?

597
00:36:10,283 --> 00:36:11,716
Keep sweeping.

598
00:36:11,716 --> 00:36:14,484
That's right. Our punishment is to sweep for a week; this is too ridiculous!

599
00:36:14,484 --> 00:36:16,115
Forget it. We were wrong, too.

600
00:36:16,116 --> 00:36:18,980
I really hate that blabber mouth.

601
00:36:18,980 --> 00:36:20,050
Gao Xiao-chun.

602
00:36:20,050 --> 00:36:23,160
Gao Xiao-chun! Are you tired of living?

603
00:36:23,160 --> 00:36:25,710
Here we go.

604
00:36:26,783 --> 00:36:28,616
Hurry up and sweep.

605
00:36:30,083 --> 00:36:31,350
Not funny.

606
00:36:31,350 --> 00:36:34,049
It was just one punch. It wasn't like we ganged up and beat him up.

607
00:36:34,050 --> 00:36:35,915
He can't help being the top student.

608
00:36:35,916 --> 00:36:38,576
The school is looking at him to get into the No.1 university.

609
00:36:40,683 --> 00:36:42,783
Why do I need to sweep?

610
00:36:44,010 --> 00:36:46,483
What's the matter? What's wrong?

611
00:36:46,483 --> 00:36:49,216
I was going to go to the fitness gym today.

612
00:36:49,216 --> 00:36:51,316
He comes in only once a week.

613
00:36:54,316 --> 00:36:56,950
It's only a week.

614
00:36:59,450 --> 00:37:02,982
Maybe if you don't show up this week, he'll miss you more.

615
00:37:06,250 --> 00:37:08,850
You can laugh now?

616
00:37:09,650 --> 00:37:11,402
You have a point.

617
00:37:11,403 --> 00:37:14,582
How can you laugh? Didn't you see his attitude?

618
00:37:14,583 --> 00:37:15,849
Should've given him a few more punches.

619
00:37:15,850 --> 00:37:18,550
How about after we sweep today, I'll treat everyone to something to eat. Okay?

620
00:37:18,550 --> 00:37:19,910
No way. How about steaks?

621
00:37:19,910 --> 00:37:21,650
Okay!

622
00:37:21,650 --> 00:37:23,282
But weren't you planning to go buy your games?

623
00:37:23,283 --> 00:37:24,815
I've saved up the money,

624
00:37:24,816 --> 00:37:26,715
b.ut with all your faces looking so disgusted

625
00:37:26,716 --> 00:37:29,010
How can I just ignore that?

626
00:37:29,010 --> 00:37:32,649
- Get that on video!
- Hurry up and record it.

627
00:37:32,650 --> 00:37:35,683
- Better not be joking with us.
- I'm not. I'll say it again.

628
00:37:35,684 --> 00:37:37,115
Every day this week after school,

629
00:37:37,116 --> 00:37:39,382
- I will treat everyone to...
- Steak!

630
00:37:39,383 --> 00:37:41,216
instant noodles.

631
00:37:41,216 --> 00:37:42,460
Fine, steaks.

632
00:37:42,460 --> 00:37:47,950
- Meat! Meat! Meat!
- Hurry up and sweep!

633
00:37:47,950 --> 00:37:49,882
After we sweep, we can eat meat.

634
00:37:49,883 --> 00:37:51,749
Just this section here. Almost done!

635
00:37:51,750 --> 00:37:54,649
- Eat meat.
- I want to eat Wang Ping!

636
00:37:54,650 --> 00:37:57,650
Going to eat.

637
00:38:08,916 --> 00:38:10,650
And up!

638
00:38:14,050 --> 00:38:15,850
And up!

639
00:38:16,916 --> 00:38:18,816
And up!

640
00:38:19,916 --> 00:38:21,650
And up!

641
00:38:23,416 --> 00:38:25,760
How come Boxiang isn't here today?

642
00:38:26,416 --> 00:38:28,282
He said he had something at school

643
00:38:28,283 --> 00:38:30,420
and won't be coming this week.

644
00:38:31,950 --> 00:38:35,049
He's at the age of having pretty short-lived enthusiasm.

645
00:38:35,050 --> 00:38:37,715
Whatever interests him these days will only last for a short time.

646
00:38:37,715 --> 00:38:40,609
This time, having him help me out has already been a pretty long time.

647
00:38:40,609 --> 00:38:42,450
I've been pretty moved by it.

648
00:38:42,450 --> 00:38:45,979
That's true. At his age now, he's pretty quick to liking something,

649
00:38:45,980 --> 00:38:48,420
then at the same time very quickly change his mind.

650
00:38:50,350 --> 00:38:54,115
Lu Chigang, is that your correct weight for training?

651
00:38:54,115 --> 00:38:57,849
When you're here at my place, forget about taking it easy.

652
00:38:57,850 --> 00:39:01,082
- Add another two plates.
- Okay.

653
00:39:01,083 --> 00:39:03,830
- Again, another 10.
- Start.

654
00:39:04,950 --> 00:39:07,216
Don't tense the shoulders. Use your core muscles.

655
00:39:07,216 --> 00:39:09,720
Go. Hold up your chest.

656
00:39:09,720 --> 00:39:11,640
Let's go!

657
00:39:14,583 --> 00:39:17,930
And up. Yell it for more power. And up!

658
00:39:19,480 --> 00:39:23,920
And up!

659
00:39:24,660 --> 00:39:26,690
And...

660
00:39:27,200 --> 00:39:28,740
up!

661
00:39:28,750 --> 00:39:31,750
Again. Scream it. And up!

662
00:39:52,516 --> 00:39:53,916
I'm sitting at your desk.

663
00:39:58,883 --> 00:40:01,703
I feel that there are some things that we need to clear up.

664
00:40:05,250 --> 00:40:07,270
See you in the back, after school.

665
00:40:19,283 --> 00:40:21,582
Hey, why can't we come with?

666
00:40:21,583 --> 00:40:23,550
- Yeah.
- We can get him, too.

667
00:40:24,283 --> 00:40:26,049
It's between him and me.

668
00:40:26,050 --> 00:40:28,300
All of you stay out of it.

669
00:40:28,300 --> 00:40:30,000
Especially you.

670
00:40:30,010 --> 00:40:31,816
So aggressive.

671
00:40:32,650 --> 00:40:34,550
How are you going to negotiate with him?

672
00:40:36,116 --> 00:40:39,349
Yeah, how am I going to negotiate with him?

673
00:40:39,350 --> 00:40:42,149
Negotiate? Are you in the mob?

674
00:40:42,150 --> 00:40:44,049
Get your head straight.

675
00:40:44,050 --> 00:40:45,910
Then, what are you going to do?

676
00:40:45,910 --> 00:40:47,815
Just say it like it is.

677
00:40:47,816 --> 00:40:51,016
If he needs to apologize, then he apologizes. That's it.

678
00:40:51,016 --> 00:40:52,904
That's not like you at all.

679
00:40:52,904 --> 00:40:54,960
If he was a girl,

680
00:40:54,960 --> 00:40:59,483
there may be the tiniest chance to consider... being friends.

681
00:40:59,483 --> 00:41:02,116
Sad.

682
00:41:07,483 --> 00:41:09,450
Feeling good?

683
00:41:09,450 --> 00:41:12,150
- Feeling good.
- I can see that.

684
00:41:13,150 --> 00:41:14,916
It's very obvious?

685
00:41:14,916 --> 00:41:16,883
Super obvious.

686
00:41:20,150 --> 00:41:21,649
What is it?

687
00:41:21,650 --> 00:41:24,216
My cousin told me he asked about me.

688
00:41:25,750 --> 00:41:28,510
No. Give it to me.

689
00:41:28,510 --> 00:41:30,880
Let me see it.

690
00:41:30,950 --> 00:41:33,216
Stingy.

691
00:42:01,383 --> 00:42:03,083
Stand me up?

692
00:42:07,650 --> 00:42:10,183
I should've got his number.

693
00:42:16,916 --> 00:42:18,850
Yu Shigu!

694
00:42:21,816 --> 00:42:24,515
- Teacher Huang.
- What is it, Xiang Haoting?

695
00:42:24,516 --> 00:42:27,150
Yu Shigu's not here. Are you looking for him?

696
00:42:32,950 --> 00:42:35,616
I'm just passing by.

697
00:42:47,450 --> 00:42:49,050
Write quickly.

698
00:42:59,083 --> 00:43:00,549
If they continue to cook like that,

699
00:43:00,600 --> 00:43:02,600
the pearls for the bubble tea will become meatballs

700
00:43:02,800 --> 00:43:04,100
I'm sorry!

701
00:43:04,340 --> 00:43:06,450
It's okay, I shut it off.

702
00:43:07,783 --> 00:43:10,915
What's wrong? You're not feeling well?

703
00:43:10,916 --> 00:43:13,515
- Got something on your mind?
- It's nothing.

704
00:43:13,516 --> 00:43:15,350
Are you sure it's nothing?

705
00:43:15,980 --> 00:43:17,349
Or are you worried about money again?

706
00:43:17,350 --> 00:43:18,890
It's not that.

707
00:43:18,890 --> 00:43:20,740
Did you eat dinner?

708
00:43:20,750 --> 00:43:24,050
I prepared dinner. I was going to eat it later.

709
00:43:24,050 --> 00:43:25,749
I know, it's the end of the month.

710
00:43:25,750 --> 00:43:28,283
Eating dinner later so you won't be hungry in the morning,

711
00:43:28,283 --> 00:43:30,815
there's no one else like you. Eating one meal to take the place of two.

712
00:43:30,816 --> 00:43:32,349
Here, take this home.

713
00:43:32,350 --> 00:43:33,882
Brother Chigang, it's not necessary.

714
00:43:33,883 --> 00:43:36,480
Listen to me. Go home early today.

715
00:43:37,250 --> 00:43:38,615
But I need to work until 9:00.

716
00:43:38,616 --> 00:43:41,383
You're in your third year now. There's a lot to study for.

717
00:43:41,383 --> 00:43:43,183
Hurry home and get to studying.

718
00:43:44,383 --> 00:43:47,450
Go home. Get going.

719
00:43:49,316 --> 00:43:51,349
Didn't I tell you to just leave it?

720
00:43:51,350 --> 00:43:52,882
I'll take care of it later.

721
00:43:52,883 --> 00:43:55,650
Touch it again and I'll deduce your pay.

722
00:43:56,350 --> 00:43:58,716
Hurry home and study.

723
00:44:02,883 --> 00:44:06,749
Sun Wenjie, there's no soy bean stand around here.

724
00:44:06,749 --> 00:44:10,850
You're lying! You must have got the wrong address. No way.

725
00:44:11,383 --> 00:44:15,050
Wait, I found it. Don't tell him!

726
00:44:15,051 --> 00:44:16,979
I want to give him a surprise.

727
00:44:16,980 --> 00:44:19,150
Fine, I won't say anything. Bye-bye.

728
00:44:36,010 --> 00:44:37,850
So handsome.

729
00:44:43,810 --> 00:44:46,050
What's your relationship with Brother Chigang?

730
00:44:48,550 --> 00:44:50,950
Don't say you don't know him.

731
00:44:50,950 --> 00:44:53,150
I saw the two of you last night.

732
00:44:56,050 --> 00:44:57,615
It's none of your business

733
00:44:57,616 --> 00:44:59,383
What do you guys want anyway?

734
00:44:59,383 --> 00:45:01,350
Stop hassling me.

735
00:45:08,930 --> 00:45:14,420
♫ I still don’t understand why you left ♫

736
00:45:14,420 --> 00:45:20,390
♫ I still don’t understand why I’m waiting ♫

737
00:45:20,390 --> 00:45:26,250
♫ Waiting for who will remember their responsibility ♫

738
00:45:26,250 --> 00:45:31,950
♫ I’m left at the original place wandering around alone ♫

739
00:45:31,950 --> 00:45:37,290
♫ When the blue sky and white clouds disappear ♫

740
00:45:37,290 --> 00:45:42,690
♫ When you take away the yellow sneakers and the red sweater ♫

741
00:45:42,690 --> 00:45:48,060
♫ When all the colors are gone along with you ♫

742
00:45:48,060 --> 00:45:54,820
♫ Only transparent tears that unceasingly fall accompany me ♫

743
00:45:54,820 --> 00:46:00,280
♫ I still don’t understand why you left ♫

744

♫ I’m left at the original place wandering around alone ♫

747
00:46:16,430 --> 00:46:21,780
♫ When one story becomes two regrets ♫

748
00:46:21,780 --> 00:46:28,040
♫ Letting two hearts run towards two different futures ♫

749
00:46:28,040 --> 00:46:33,550
♫ All those that can’t be forgotten can only become regrets ♫

750
00:46:33,550 --> 00:46:40,870
♫ But I still can’t understand why the tears won’t stop ♫
