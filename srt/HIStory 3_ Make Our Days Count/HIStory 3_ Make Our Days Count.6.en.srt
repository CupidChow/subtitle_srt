[HIStory 3: Make Our Days Count]
[Episode 6]

14
00:01:46,400 --> 00:01:47,300
I'm almost done.

15
00:01:47,301 --> 00:01:48,565
Wait for me to come out and help you.

16
00:01:48,566 --> 00:01:50,200
Okay.

17
00:03:53,500 --> 00:03:55,100
I love you.

18
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:10,500
Be careful.

19
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:14,200
What do you want to do in the future?

20
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:16,699
I don't know.

21
00:05:16,700 --> 00:05:18,900
I'll do whatever you do.

22
00:05:34,166 --> 00:05:36,400
What a beautiful nightscape!

23
00:05:37,800 --> 00:05:40,265
When I used to come as a kid, the trees weren't as tall yet.

24
00:05:40,265 --> 00:05:42,300
You could see even further.

25
00:05:42,800 --> 00:05:44,365
Really?

26
00:05:44,366 --> 00:05:45,700
Look.

27
00:05:49,666 --> 00:05:51,665
What is this?

28
00:05:51,666 --> 00:05:52,899
Guess.

29
00:05:52,900 --> 00:05:55,500
This... Who would put something here?

30
00:05:55,500 --> 00:05:57,200
Me.

31
00:06:16,900 --> 00:06:18,200
Thank you.

32
00:06:24,300 --> 00:06:26,400
Here.

33
00:06:29,300 --> 00:06:30,700
Careful.

34
00:06:31,766 --> 00:06:33,600
Smells so good.

35
00:06:36,800 --> 00:06:38,499
How does it taste?

36
00:06:38,500 --> 00:06:39,599
Really sweet.

37
00:06:39,600 --> 00:06:41,300
I need to cook it a bit longer.

38
00:06:47,800 --> 00:06:50,199
I loved stargazing since I was a kid.

39
00:06:50,200 --> 00:06:51,899
Like my mom and dad.

40
00:06:51,900 --> 00:06:53,300
Really?

41
00:06:54,300 --> 00:06:58,099
Some say that when we leave, we become stars.

42
00:06:58,100 --> 00:07:00,500
Watching over the living people in the sky.

43
00:07:03,500 --> 00:07:06,700
So when I was young, when I didn't know what to do,

44
00:07:06,700 --> 00:07:09,000
I would talk to the stars.

45
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:11,666
In the end, it seemed like I'd always find the answers.

46
00:07:13,200 --> 00:07:18,899
That day, Mom and Dad went to chase after the Rose Nebula.

47
00:07:22,500 --> 00:07:24,500
Then they never came back.

48
00:07:29,066 --> 00:07:34,365
So I continue to believe they are living on that Nebula now.

49
00:07:43,100 --> 00:07:44,966
Do you believe it?

50
00:08:05,166 --> 00:08:06,800
I believe you.

51
00:08:28,400 --> 00:08:29,900
And...

52
00:08:31,900 --> 00:08:35,400
they're probably smiling down at you now.

53
00:08:43,900 --> 00:08:46,260
In the future, I'll for sure study the stars.

54
00:08:47,200 --> 00:08:50,165
Study stars...

55
00:08:50,166 --> 00:08:55,365
To study the stars you'll need to get into Zoology, right?

56
00:08:57,600 --> 00:08:58,999
It's physics.

57
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:01,000
Physics?

58
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:04,500
Because astrologers are usually involved in many different fields.

59
00:09:04,500 --> 00:09:07,066
Like mechanics, electromagnetism,

60
00:09:07,066 --> 00:09:09,700
statistical mechanics, quantum mechanics,

61
00:09:09,700 --> 00:09:12,700
also relativity and particle physics.

62
00:09:12,700 --> 00:09:14,466
Relativity?

63
00:09:16,066 --> 00:09:18,800
Sounds really difficult.

64
00:09:18,800 --> 00:09:21,220
If that's the case, how am I ever going to get in?

65
00:09:22,700 --> 00:09:25,399
You're also interested in the stars?

66
00:09:25,400 --> 00:09:27,999
Because of you.

67
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:30,366
I want to study in the same department as you.

68
00:09:31,500 --> 00:09:33,899
How can you be so careless in determining your future?

69
00:09:33,899 --> 00:09:35,850
I'm not.

70
00:09:37,300 --> 00:09:39,010
I'm serious.

71
00:09:56,600 --> 00:09:58,066
I've decided.

72
00:09:59,800 --> 00:10:01,666
Physics it is.

73
00:10:02,800 --> 00:10:05,299
You better not regret it later on.

74
00:10:05,300 --> 00:10:08,400
I won't.

75
00:10:47,066 --> 00:10:52,266
Let us welcome the return of number two in the entire school,

76
00:10:52,266 --> 00:10:56,000
Xiang Haoting!

77
00:10:58,200 --> 00:11:01,265
Xiang Haoting!

78
00:11:01,266 --> 00:11:02,699
Your award.

79
00:11:02,700 --> 00:11:06,300
Do you see? The real study machine is here!

80
00:11:08,666 --> 00:11:09,799
Almighty and powerful.

81
00:11:09,800 --> 00:11:12,765
Once again, our mistress has returned.

82
00:11:12,766 --> 00:11:14,065
Please say a few words.

83
00:11:14,066 --> 00:11:15,700
Thank you.

84
00:11:16,700 --> 00:11:21,799
Firstly, I have to thank my Yu Shigu.

85
00:11:21,799 --> 00:11:25,100
Also, Yu Shigu and Yu Shigu.

86
00:11:25,100 --> 00:11:28,099
Thank you, everyone. I did it!

87
00:11:29,300 --> 00:11:30,967
Even this, he can display public affection.

88
00:11:30,967 --> 00:11:33,500
Yes. Very good!

89
00:11:34,700 --> 00:11:35,999
You should treat us to a meal.

90
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:37,099
Treat us!

91
00:11:37,100 --> 00:11:39,265
Not a problem.

92
00:11:39,266 --> 00:11:40,699
How about today?

93
00:11:40,700 --> 00:11:42,266
Sure!

94
00:11:43,900 --> 00:11:45,599
Today, I can't.

95
00:11:45,600 --> 00:11:47,565
Why?

96
00:11:47,566 --> 00:11:50,965
Because today I need to be with my Brother Chigang.

97
00:11:52,100 --> 00:11:55,199
Old Sun, we are also your boy friends.

98
00:11:55,199 --> 00:11:56,799
- Yeah.
- Exactly.

99
00:11:56,800 --> 00:11:57,965
Not the same!

100
00:11:57,966 --> 00:11:59,765
Your lover before friends.

101
00:11:59,766 --> 00:12:01,900
That's not true!

102
00:12:04,166 --> 00:12:07,299
We-dg-ie!

103
00:12:07,300 --> 00:12:09,099
You better not.

104
00:12:09,100 --> 00:12:10,399
Don't come closer!

105
00:12:10,400 --> 00:12:11,765
Better not!

106
00:12:11,766 --> 00:12:13,699
Get lost!

107
00:12:13,700 --> 00:12:16,500
No! Stop!

108
00:12:16,500 --> 00:12:17,565
Not good enough.

109
00:12:17,566 --> 00:12:18,866
Take it off!

110
00:12:19,366 --> 00:12:20,200
Take it off!

111
00:12:20,200 --> 00:12:23,500
I can't. I already belong to Brother Chigang.

112
00:12:28,900 --> 00:12:30,500
Stop!

113
00:12:33,400 --> 00:12:34,965
What are you guys doing?

114
00:12:34,966 --> 00:12:36,600
We...

115
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:46,265
Yeah. What are you guys doing?

116
00:12:46,265 --> 00:12:48,399
What is this? Flasher?

117
00:12:48,399 --> 00:12:49,966
Dirty.

118
00:12:50,600 --> 00:12:52,999
Let's just ignore them.

119
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:55,500
My dad told me he wanted to treat you to a meal to properly thank you.

120
00:12:55,500 --> 00:12:57,365
Really? Okay.

121
00:12:57,365 --> 00:12:59,299
Let's go.

122
00:12:59,300 --> 00:13:00,810
Wait!

123
00:13:01,766 --> 00:13:03,199
Sorry to disturb you.

124
00:13:03,200 --> 00:13:04,800
Bye-bye.

125
00:13:06,366 --> 00:13:07,100
An award, too.

126
00:13:07,101 --> 00:13:08,865
Really?

127
00:13:08,866 --> 00:13:10,366
Where you going?

128
00:13:11,300 --> 00:13:14,700
Nothing. If we're done here, I'm going to take off.

129
00:13:16,366 --> 00:13:17,000
Stop playing!

130
00:13:17,001 --> 00:13:19,265
We-dg-ie!

131
00:13:19,266 --> 00:13:20,599
Wait!

132
00:13:20,600 --> 00:13:22,800
We should be giving it to him.

133
00:13:24,700 --> 00:13:26,566
Gao Xiao-chun!

134
00:13:28,300 --> 00:13:30,299
You don't need to lock your house door?

135
00:13:30,300 --> 00:13:33,300
No need. It's very safe here.

136
00:13:33,300 --> 00:13:35,999
Are Uncle and Auntie here? I want to say hi to them.

137
00:13:35,999 --> 00:13:37,900
It's okay. They're not home.

138
00:13:37,900 --> 00:13:41,200
My dad went to his friends; my mom went to do community work.

139
00:13:41,200 --> 00:13:42,599
Where's your sister?

140
00:13:42,600 --> 00:13:43,965
Shopping for makeup.

141
00:13:43,966 --> 00:13:45,299
So there's no one home right now?

142
00:13:45,300 --> 00:13:47,166
Yup.

143
00:13:57,166 --> 00:13:59,065
Then I should come back later.

144
00:13:59,066 --> 00:14:00,800
Why come back later?

145
00:14:14,200 --> 00:14:16,200
So sensual.

146
00:14:17,300 --> 00:14:19,500
I haven't said anything yet,

147
00:14:20,766 --> 00:14:22,999
and you're already thinking it.

148
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:25,666
I just thought that we don't need to be in the bedroom.

149
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:31,800
I feel like watching TV in the living room.

150
00:14:35,300 --> 00:14:36,200
What for?

151
00:14:36,201 --> 00:14:39,265
Scared to be like Sun Bo, having your pants ripped off?

152
00:14:39,265 --> 00:14:42,400
There's nothing that you guys are not capable of.

153
00:14:47,600 --> 00:14:49,200
How do you know?

154
00:14:50,800 --> 00:14:53,066
Also, we don't care where we are either.

155
00:14:54,800 --> 00:14:56,800
Stop fooling around.

156
00:15:04,966 --> 00:15:07,800
I'm not fooling around. I'm very serious.

157
00:15:13,500 --> 00:15:16,070
I really want to kiss you right now.

158
00:16:02,100 --> 00:16:07,300
♫ Hey, lean on my back ♫

159
00:16:07,300 --> 00:16:11,000
♫ Let yourself have a good cry ♫

160
00:16:12,200 --> 00:16:17,600
♫ I will face you with my back and not disrupt your tears ♫

161
00:16:17,600 --> 00:16:21,300
♫ Let yourself be fragile for once ♫

162
00:16:21,300 --> 00:16:26,100
♫ I will be like this in front of you ♫

163
00:16:26,190 --> 00:16:32,000
♫ At the time that you need it, gently say ‘Hey’ ♫

164
00:17:01,800 --> 00:17:03,699
What the heck are you guys doing?

165
00:17:03,700 --> 00:17:05,900
Dad!

166
00:17:11,400 --> 00:17:13,099
What are you two doing?

167
00:17:13,100 --> 00:17:14,365
I forced him.

168
00:17:14,366 --> 00:17:17,099
I harassed him and told him to like me.

169
00:17:17,100 --> 00:17:18,699
So he was forced to like me.

170
00:17:18,700 --> 00:17:19,866
You still have an excuse!

171
00:17:19,866 --> 00:17:21,699
Stop joking around.

172
00:17:21,700 --> 00:17:24,266
I'm not joking. It's all the truth.

173
00:17:24,266 --> 00:17:27,966
Like the mock-up picture incident. The person I framed was him.

174
00:17:27,966 --> 00:17:30,266
Is he telling the truth?

175
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:33,100
Tell me the truth!

176
00:17:33,101 --> 00:17:35,865
Dad, don't be so loud!

177
00:17:35,866 --> 00:17:37,600
If you want to blame someone, blame me.

178
00:17:37,600 --> 00:17:39,065
What are you talking back for?

179
00:17:39,066 --> 00:17:40,899
Do you have any ethics and morals? Have no sense of shame?

180
00:17:40,899 --> 00:17:42,199
Do you want any grace for yourself?

181
00:17:42,200 --> 00:17:45,599
Get involved in such an absurd relationship and to act as if it's normal.

182
00:17:47,366 --> 00:17:50,899
So to like a boy is shameless and not normal?

183
00:17:52,900 --> 00:17:54,599
I can like who I want, it's my freedom!

184
00:17:54,600 --> 00:17:55,466
Xiang Haoting!

185
00:17:55,467 --> 00:17:57,410
Let me finish!

186
00:17:58,366 --> 00:18:00,366
It's all my fault.

187
00:18:08,866 --> 00:18:11,070
But we've decided to be together.

188
00:18:12,300 --> 00:18:14,166
- You can't!
- Why can't we?

189
00:18:14,166 --> 00:18:15,965
Because I said so.

190
00:18:15,966 --> 00:18:17,965
How can it be right for two boys to be together?

191
00:18:17,966 --> 00:18:19,265
You're being a disgrace to the Xiang family.

192
00:18:19,266 --> 00:18:22,865
As long as you have the same last name as I do, I just won't allow it.

193
00:18:23,400 --> 00:18:24,866
Then I'll change my name.

194
00:18:26,100 --> 00:18:27,900
What did you say?

195
00:18:29,266 --> 00:18:33,099
What are you guys doing? Stop arguing!

196
00:18:36,100 --> 00:18:37,966
I'm sorry.

197
00:18:42,600 --> 00:18:46,065
Student Yu, please leave our house.

198
00:18:47,600 --> 00:18:49,400
I'm sorry.

199
00:18:52,300 --> 00:18:54,000
Yu Shigu!

200
00:18:57,000 --> 00:18:58,999
Xiang Haoting, you stay right there!

201
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:00,600
Where are you going?

202
00:19:01,800 --> 00:19:04,400
Just go to your room!

203
00:19:19,330 --> 00:19:23,020
[Super Gym]

204
00:19:26,700 --> 00:19:30,599
Miss you so much, miss you, miss you!

205
00:19:30,600 --> 00:19:34,399
This is the gym. Keep your distance.

206
00:19:36,500 --> 00:19:37,799
There's no one here now.

207
00:19:37,800 --> 00:19:39,466
Still, don't.

208
00:19:40,266 --> 00:19:43,799
I have something really important to tell you.

209
00:19:43,800 --> 00:19:44,800
What is it?

210
00:19:44,801 --> 00:19:46,799
My winter break is coming.

211
00:19:46,800 --> 00:19:48,465
Let's go on a date.

212
00:19:48,466 --> 00:19:50,700
One of those really long dates.

213
00:19:52,066 --> 00:19:54,365
You're a student getting ready for exams now. You need to focus on your studies.

214
00:19:54,365 --> 00:19:56,600
Exam students have a right to relax, don't we?

215
00:19:56,600 --> 00:19:59,265
When you succeed in getting the grades, then you'll have the right to relax.

216
00:19:59,266 --> 00:20:01,399
I improved seven places from last time.

217
00:20:01,400 --> 00:20:03,166
Now, do I have the right?

218
00:20:04,566 --> 00:20:06,066
Yes.

219
00:20:23,866 --> 00:20:27,099
I'll take care of everything. Give me your work schedule.

220
00:20:27,101 --> 00:20:30,299
Okay. Hurry up and get to work.

221
00:20:30,300 --> 00:20:31,799
Work hard.

222
00:20:31,800 --> 00:20:33,499
You...

223
00:20:33,500 --> 00:20:39,100
We're going on a date. We're going on a date.

224
00:20:54,100 --> 00:20:55,600
What's up with you?

225
00:20:57,766 --> 00:21:00,400
Sun Wenjie, what are you doing? Stop messing around.

226
00:21:01,266 --> 00:21:03,000
Immature!

227
00:21:12,700 --> 00:21:15,200
Anyway, for the next few days,

228
00:21:17,100 --> 00:21:19,500
please take care of him for me.

229
00:21:24,800 --> 00:21:27,300
Mom said you didn't eat any dinner.

230
00:21:28,200 --> 00:21:30,200
I'm not hungry.

231
00:21:37,200 --> 00:21:42,465
Brother, you really like boys?

232
00:21:46,600 --> 00:21:48,800
Not all boys, I only like him.

233
00:21:50,766 --> 00:21:53,765
Don't you like big boobs?

234
00:21:53,766 --> 00:21:58,800
I like him much more than big boobs.

235
00:21:58,800 --> 00:22:03,265
That's true. You've never been so kind to any of your ex-girlfriends.

236
00:22:03,265 --> 00:22:05,566
You even have someone to look after him for you.

237
00:22:11,766 --> 00:22:14,499
Because he doesn't have a cell phone.

238
00:22:14,500 --> 00:22:16,799
He doesn't have a cell phone?

239
00:22:16,800 --> 00:22:19,566
Who doesn't have a cell phone these days?

240
00:22:26,166 --> 00:22:28,200
I can't get in touch with him.

241
00:22:30,900 --> 00:22:33,300
He's probably very scared now.

242
00:22:37,200 --> 00:22:40,866
If he's scared, it'll affect his studies...

243
00:22:40,866 --> 00:22:43,799
and will affect his future.

244
00:22:43,800 --> 00:22:47,866
I know. He's persevered for so long

245
00:22:47,866 --> 00:22:50,866
and finally made it to third year.

246
00:22:52,166 --> 00:22:54,140
But just because of me...

247
00:23:17,300 --> 00:23:19,900
Why did I have to be so rash?

248
00:23:29,700 --> 00:23:32,300
You know, he walked out just like that.

249
00:23:33,300 --> 00:23:37,000
I really wanted to chase after him. Call out and stop him

250
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:40,400
and tell him, "Don't be scared!

251
00:23:40,400 --> 00:23:42,300
I'm right here!"

252
00:23:47,300 --> 00:23:49,000
But I couldn't

253
00:24:06,500 --> 00:24:09,400
Anyway, I'm free once I get to college.

254
00:24:10,100 --> 00:24:15,300
Before then, I can... stop contacting him,

255
00:24:15,300 --> 00:24:17,566
not see him, not talk to him.

256
00:24:17,566 --> 00:24:19,299
I can also say that I don't like him,

257
00:24:19,300 --> 00:24:21,600
I can even say that I don't,,,

258
00:24:23,566 --> 00:24:26,400
I can also say I don't love him,

259
00:24:31,200 --> 00:24:33,500
But what if he gives up?

260
00:24:48,100 --> 00:24:50,600
What if he backs away?

261
00:24:53,066 --> 00:24:55,900
I'm so scared that he'll back away.

262
00:25:03,900 --> 00:25:05,666
Don't worry.

263
00:25:07,200 --> 00:25:09,465
Your brother is very brave.

264
00:25:09,466 --> 00:25:12,066
Brother, you are the bravest.

265
00:25:47,300 --> 00:25:48,966
Good morning! How are you?

266
00:25:57,400 --> 00:25:58,949
Do you have time to talk?

267
00:25:58,950 --> 00:26:00,500
Sure.

268
00:26:12,700 --> 00:26:15,666
I noticed that you don't have many customers here.

269
00:26:15,666 --> 00:26:17,900
How's your business?

270
00:26:17,900 --> 00:26:20,865
You haven't lost a few million yet, have you?

271
00:26:20,866 --> 00:26:23,666
I'm okay. Still hanging on.

272
00:26:25,966 --> 00:26:28,166
That's good!

273
00:26:29,466 --> 00:26:33,899
You came here to talk about my business?

274
00:26:35,166 --> 00:26:38,065
We are considered friends, after all.

275
00:26:38,066 --> 00:26:42,299
I came to see how you were doing, to see how the store is doing.

276
00:26:42,299 --> 00:26:43,966
Isn't that okay?

277
00:26:44,566 --> 00:26:48,499
So you really came just to Buddy Talk.

278
00:26:51,400 --> 00:26:52,700
No.

279
00:26:55,700 --> 00:26:57,699
Just say whatever you want to say.

280
00:26:57,700 --> 00:26:59,965
But I won't leave him.

281
00:26:59,966 --> 00:27:02,500
I know your cousin's still very young, his ways aren't completely set yet.

282
00:27:02,500 --> 00:27:05,300
But I believe and have faith that we will continue to be together for a long time.

283
00:27:05,300 --> 00:27:06,699
Because we're not like other people.

284
00:27:06,700 --> 00:27:08,600
Okay, stop.

285
00:27:10,200 --> 00:27:15,099
I came here not to listen to how steadfast your love story is.

286
00:27:15,100 --> 00:27:17,299
I came to remind you.

287
00:27:17,300 --> 00:27:19,300
Remind me?

288
00:27:19,300 --> 00:27:20,999
You said it.

289
00:27:21,000 --> 00:27:22,999
Your age difference is too much.

290
00:27:23,000 --> 00:27:26,999
Besides with your personality, for sure he's going to have you on a very tight leash.

291
00:27:26,999 --> 00:27:29,599
At his age now, he's like a monkey.

292
00:27:29,600 --> 00:27:31,799
He doesn't understand what people are saying.

293
00:27:31,800 --> 00:27:34,000
So I thought about it for a long time.

294
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:37,065
I feel that you will need to control this.

295
00:27:37,066 --> 00:27:38,966
Control?

296
00:27:48,400 --> 00:27:52,900
However long both of your love will last is both of your business.

297
00:27:52,900 --> 00:27:54,865
But he's my cousin!

298
00:27:54,866 --> 00:27:57,665
I need to protect him.

299
00:27:57,666 --> 00:28:03,799
So safe sex is very important.

300
00:28:11,000 --> 00:28:12,800
Okay?

301
00:28:21,466 --> 00:28:23,300
Hurry up and...

302
00:28:30,800 --> 00:28:33,166
put them away.

303
00:28:43,566 --> 00:28:45,899
Sun Wenjie!

304
00:28:45,900 --> 00:28:47,565
Why did you give him condoms?

305
00:28:47,566 --> 00:28:49,565
Keep it down, you little brat!

306
00:28:49,566 --> 00:28:52,600
Also, what kind of tone is that?

307
00:28:52,600 --> 00:28:54,299
What are you scheming?

308
00:28:54,300 --> 00:28:56,199
If you dare mess this up,

309
00:28:56,200 --> 00:28:58,066
I'll tell your girlfriend you're cheating on her!

310
00:28:58,066 --> 00:29:01,666
When did you ever see me wanting to mess things up?

311
00:29:01,666 --> 00:29:03,999
I'm seeing it with both my eyes!

312
00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:06,800
Then I'll poke them out for you!

313
00:29:07,600 --> 00:29:08,467
Enough!

314
00:29:08,467 --> 00:29:10,499
Why are you trying to mess up my love life?

315
00:29:10,500 --> 00:29:12,999
Who's trying to mess up your love life?

316
00:29:13,000 --> 00:29:16,000
You need to calm down!

317
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:18,299
- Excuse me, Boss.
- Good morning. How are you?

318
00:29:18,299 --> 00:29:20,200
I want a bottle of soymilk.

319
00:29:20,200 --> 00:29:22,200
Sure. Over here, please.

320
00:29:23,900 --> 00:29:25,100
Do you want warm, hot, or iced?

321
00:29:25,100 --> 00:29:27,100
- Iced.
- Okay.

322
00:29:27,100 --> 00:29:29,466
Would you like anything else?

323
00:29:39,100 --> 00:29:41,060
My brother wanted me to give this to you.

324
00:29:42,266 --> 00:29:44,900
Take it.

325
00:29:46,300 --> 00:29:48,700
I gave it to you. Bye-bye.

326
00:30:17,700 --> 00:30:19,666
Xiang Yongching!

327
00:30:21,500 --> 00:30:23,965
Where did you run off to so late? Look at you, wearing that.

328
00:30:23,965 --> 00:30:27,700
Don't you know that it's very dangerous?

329
00:30:27,700 --> 00:30:30,465
When you came back at midnight last time, I warned you already.

330
00:30:30,466 --> 00:30:35,700
If you do this again, I'm going to take away your allowance and ground you for ten days.

331
00:30:35,700 --> 00:30:39,299
Mommy, last time it was because my phone ran out of battery,

332
00:30:39,299 --> 00:30:41,965
so I didn't realize the time.

333
00:30:41,966 --> 00:30:43,900
I won't do it again.

334
00:30:44,500 --> 00:30:46,500
What about this time?

335
00:30:50,100 --> 00:30:52,700
What did you go do for your brother?

336
00:30:55,500 --> 00:30:58,065
Don't think that Mommy doesn't know anything.

337
00:30:58,066 --> 00:31:00,399
Both of you are my kids.

338
00:31:00,400 --> 00:31:02,899
Wherever your eyes dart, whatever joint is out of place,

339
00:31:02,899 --> 00:31:05,499
I know all.

340
00:31:05,500 --> 00:31:06,800
Also,

341
00:31:09,566 --> 00:31:11,499
helping your brother is okay,

342
00:31:11,500 --> 00:31:13,865
but don't do anything dangerous.

343
00:31:13,866 --> 00:31:15,666
Understand?

344
00:31:16,900 --> 00:31:18,701
Okay. It's very late.

345
00:31:18,701 --> 00:31:21,200
Hurry up and take a shower and get to sleep.

346
00:31:23,466 --> 00:31:24,565
Look at you wearing that.

347
00:31:24,566 --> 00:31:26,599
So dangerous now for girls that go outside these days.

348
00:31:26,600 --> 00:31:27,699
Goodnight, Mommy.

349
00:31:27,700 --> 00:31:28,666
Goodnight!

350
00:31:28,667 --> 00:31:30,165
Hurry up to bed.

351
00:31:30,166 --> 00:31:32,499
It's really too much. I was worried to death.

352
00:31:32,499 --> 00:31:36,399
- Wearing such short shorts.
- Xiang Haoting.

353
00:31:49,066 --> 00:31:52,400
Why didn't you come out and speak for me just now?

354
00:31:54,800 --> 00:31:55,500
Did you give him the stuff?

355
00:31:55,501 --> 00:31:57,066
Yes.

356
00:32:00,200 --> 00:32:01,600
Thank you.

357
00:32:10,300 --> 00:32:12,200
Life.

00:33:53,500 --> 00:33:54,700
Hello.

Hello!

363
00:34:01,400 --> 00:34:02,999
Hello?

364
00:34:03,000 --> 00:34:04,600
Yu Shigu!

365
00:34:07,500 --> 00:34:10,200
Yu Shigu, can you hear me?

366
00:34:10,200 --> 00:34:11,600
Hello?

367
00:34:16,800 --> 00:34:18,366
I'm sorry.

368
00:34:22,400 --> 00:34:25,366
I let you suffer.

369
00:34:25,366 --> 00:34:27,500
You have to keep working hard.

370
00:34:29,500 --> 00:34:30,999
I'll continue to be brave.

371
00:34:31,000 --> 00:34:32,900
Trust me!

372
00:34:34,566 --> 00:34:36,400
Do you hear me?

373
00:34:48,066 --> 00:34:50,000
Yu Shigu?

374
00:34:53,600 --> 00:34:55,066
Yu Shigu?

375
00:34:55,510 --> 00:34:57,520
Yu Shigu?

376
00:35:48,866 --> 00:35:50,800
You bought too much stuff!

377
00:35:50,800 --> 00:35:53,200
It's New Years. It's mandatory.

378
00:35:53,200 --> 00:35:55,200
It's a lot of money.

379
00:35:56,000 --> 00:35:59,000
Here. A New Year's present for you.

380
00:36:01,166 --> 00:36:03,400
How do you know I like this?

381
00:36:04,166 --> 00:36:06,300
This is for your brother and sister.

382
00:36:08,866 --> 00:36:11,000
This is for your parents.

383
00:36:12,600 --> 00:36:14,999
This is so expensive!

384
00:36:15,000 --> 00:36:16,966
Parents love this stuff.

385
00:36:19,666 --> 00:36:21,199
Wait!

386
00:36:21,200 --> 00:36:22,999
You even got this?

387
00:36:23,000 --> 00:36:24,099
You're too professional.

388
00:36:24,100 --> 00:36:25,866
When I bought all this stuff, the store gave it to me.

389
00:36:25,866 --> 00:36:28,966
I thought you guys could probably use it.

390
00:36:28,966 --> 00:36:31,200
You really are too thoughtful.

391
00:36:43,400 --> 00:36:44,966
What is it?

392
00:36:46,666 --> 00:36:50,266
Next week, I won't be able to see you at all.

393
00:36:52,766 --> 00:36:55,100
Won't you miss me?

394
00:36:55,100 --> 00:36:57,800
You haven't left yet.

395
00:36:57,800 --> 00:37:01,499
But why do I get the feeling I'm missing you already?

396
00:37:03,500 --> 00:37:05,800
It's just going back home for the holidays.

397
00:37:05,800 --> 00:37:07,965
Besides, when you go home,

398
00:37:07,966 --> 00:37:11,599
you'll be able to see all your brothers and sisters and your family.

399
00:37:13,800 --> 00:37:18,099
Don't forget. Also, the red envelopes that you've been expecting.

400
00:37:19,066 --> 00:37:22,300
I want you, I don't want red envelopes.

401
00:37:22,300 --> 00:37:24,399
What do I want red envelopes for?

402
00:37:24,400 --> 00:37:26,866
Then, can I visit you during the holidays to ask for a red envelope?

403
00:37:26,866 --> 00:37:28,965
Sure, of course, you can.

404
00:37:28,966 --> 00:37:32,500
I'll prepare a huge red envelope for you!

405
00:37:35,300 --> 00:37:40,499
Right. Then shouldn't I prepare some things to go to your house?

406
00:37:40,499 --> 00:37:43,900
What do your parents like to eat? Sweet or salty things?

407
00:37:43,900 --> 00:37:46,199
How about I'll ask my mom to make them.

408
00:37:46,200 --> 00:37:49,600
My grandma's Leek Chicken soup, it's super delicious.

409
00:37:50,966 --> 00:37:53,500
I haven't been home for a long while now.

410
00:37:54,666 --> 00:37:56,066
Why?

411
00:37:57,300 --> 00:38:01,400
At the time, I was caught in a relationship with my senior brother in college.

412
00:38:01,400 --> 00:38:04,866
After that, I didn't go home.

413
00:38:06,566 --> 00:38:09,566
The senior brother you told me about before?

414
00:38:11,966 --> 00:38:14,800
Your first love, the one you were involved with for five years?

415
00:38:23,066 --> 00:38:24,900
What is it now?

416
00:38:26,200 --> 00:38:28,099
Nothing.

417
00:38:28,100 --> 00:38:31,299
It's just during the New Year holidays,

418
00:38:31,300 --> 00:38:34,999
I can't bear you being alone.

419
00:38:37,266 --> 00:38:39,099
I'm fine.

420
00:38:39,100 --> 00:38:42,100
There's a bunch of friends that I get together with to eat New Year's dinner.

421
00:38:42,100 --> 00:38:43,799
We play some cards and Mahjong.

422
00:38:43,800 --> 00:38:45,500
You don't need to worry.

423
00:38:46,500 --> 00:38:49,799
I'll find a chance to introduce you to them.

424
00:38:49,799 --> 00:38:51,400
Okay!

425
00:38:53,000 --> 00:38:56,799
Then, in that case, I'll have to find you before the New Year Monster can get you.

426
00:39:06,900 --> 00:39:09,065
Are you sure you just play Mahjong?

427
00:39:09,066 --> 00:39:11,680
Yup, Taiwanese 16 tile style.

428
00:39:12,500 --> 00:39:13,990
That's all.

429
00:39:14,800 --> 00:39:16,999
We gamble a bit.

430
00:39:17,000 --> 00:39:19,466
You better behave yourself.

431
00:39:20,866 --> 00:39:22,065
You think too much.

432
00:39:22,066 --> 00:39:23,400
Here.

433
00:39:25,966 --> 00:39:27,766
Then you have to teach me how to play Mahjong.

434
00:39:27,766 --> 00:39:30,599
Sure, no problem.

435
00:39:30,600 --> 00:39:32,099
When you get back to Taipei, I'll teach you.

436
00:39:32,100 --> 00:39:33,480
Okay.

437
00:39:33,966 --> 00:39:37,699
Maybe I'll learn when I'm home and beat the pants off you.

438
00:39:40,400 --> 00:39:41,400
Let's go!

439
00:39:41,401 --> 00:39:43,200
There's another store up ahead that's having a sale.

440
00:39:43,200 --> 00:39:44,599
Let's go take a look.

441
00:39:44,600 --> 00:39:46,399
You want to buy more?

442
00:39:46,400 --> 00:39:49,100
Of course. If not now, when?

443
00:39:49,100 --> 00:39:51,300
Okay, I'll get the stuff,

444
00:39:53,000 --> 00:39:54,900
but I feel like going to a movie.

445
00:39:54,900 --> 00:39:56,199
No problem.

446
00:39:56,200 --> 00:39:58,700
- You shop with me first, I'll go see a movie with you.
- Okay.

447
00:39:58,700 --> 00:39:59,966
Okay? Let's go.

448
00:39:59,966 --> 00:40:00,966
Go.

449
00:40:00,967 --> 00:40:03,200
Be careful.

450
00:40:03,200 --> 00:40:05,100
Okay.

451
00:40:07,966 --> 00:40:10,065
- We're on the street.
- Who cares?

452
00:40:10,065 --> 00:40:11,600
The street.

453
00:40:16,000 --> 00:40:18,200
Son, wait, wait, wait!

454
00:40:18,200 --> 00:40:21,365
You need to clean the dust from the windows first then sweep and mop the floor.

455
00:40:21,365 --> 00:40:23,400
Do the windows first.

456
00:40:25,600 --> 00:40:28,665
Sister is so good. You continue.

457
00:40:31,766 --> 00:40:33,399
Our son is very good this year.

458
00:40:33,400 --> 00:40:35,565
Volunteering to do housework for free,

459
00:40:35,566 --> 00:40:38,265
and he didn't even ask more for his red envelope.

460
00:40:38,266 --> 00:40:41,199
Dad, don't be happy too early.

461
00:40:41,199 --> 00:40:45,099
When your son is being good, something must be wrong.

462
00:40:46,300 --> 00:40:49,200
Sister, get the door please.

463
00:40:49,200 --> 00:40:52,400
Then I'm going to put Mrs. Lin's over here.

464
00:40:55,466 --> 00:40:57,100
Brother!

465
00:41:03,800 --> 00:41:05,600
What are you doing here?

466
00:41:06,300 --> 00:41:08,199
I'm not here to see you.

467
00:41:08,200 --> 00:41:10,366
I came to see your parents.

468
00:41:14,866 --> 00:41:16,666
How are you, Uncle? Sorry to disturb.

469
00:41:16,666 --> 00:41:19,466
What are you doing here? We don't welcome you here.

470
00:41:19,466 --> 00:41:21,399
I have some things to say to you and Auntie.

471
00:41:21,400 --> 00:41:22,465
Just go home!

472
00:41:22,466 --> 00:41:25,100
What's going on? Who is it?

473
00:41:30,500 --> 00:41:32,266
Come in.

474
00:41:33,900 --> 00:41:35,666
Come in. Come in.

475
00:41:37,800 --> 00:41:40,100
Sister, go get a glass of water.

476
00:41:42,800 --> 00:41:44,799
- You, go to your room.
- It's okay.

477
00:41:44,799 --> 00:41:46,499
Here... Everyone, sit down.

478
00:41:46,500 --> 00:41:48,301
Come. Sit.

479
00:41:48,301 --> 00:41:51,800
Do you have something you want to say to us?

480
00:41:56,866 --> 00:41:59,700
I'm hoping Uncle and Auntie can allow us to see each other.

481
00:41:59,700 --> 00:42:02,565
What are you talking about? No way!

482
00:42:02,565 --> 00:42:04,399
Daddy!

483
00:42:04,400 --> 00:42:07,599
I know you two won't accept it and will be worried.

484
00:42:07,599 --> 00:42:11,200
But I really believe being together with Xiang Haoting, we can make the future much better.

485
00:42:11,200 --> 00:42:14,500
What are two of you boys getting involved for and talking about your future?

486
00:42:14,500 --> 00:42:15,799
I will never allow it!

487
00:42:15,799 --> 00:42:17,600
Don't even think about it!

488
00:42:19,600 --> 00:42:24,399
Why do you have so much faith thinking you're able to have a future?

489
00:42:24,400 --> 00:42:27,199
My grades have always been very good and have never done anything wrong or bad.

490
00:42:27,199 --> 00:42:30,200
I will for sure get into the top national university.

491
00:42:30,200 --> 00:42:31,765
I will focus even more on my studies.

492
00:42:31,766 --> 00:42:35,300
Get a good job after graduating, work hard to make a name for myself.

493
00:42:35,300 --> 00:42:38,365
You're just a kid! What do you know about the future?

494
00:42:38,366 --> 00:42:40,199
Are you too naive?

495
00:42:40,200 --> 00:42:42,700
You think things are so simple?

496
00:42:45,100 --> 00:42:46,699
You'll be great.

497
00:42:46,700 --> 00:42:50,099
But our son will not be better.

498
00:42:50,100 --> 00:42:51,499
Mommy!

499
00:42:51,500 --> 00:42:52,899
Auntie, please don't worry.

500
00:42:52,900 --> 00:42:54,199
I will tutor Xiang Haoting with his studies.

501
00:42:54,200 --> 00:42:55,999
Let him get into university.

502
00:42:56,000 --> 00:42:58,199
We will overcome a lot of problems together.

503
00:42:58,200 --> 00:43:02,400
Whether Xiang Haoting can get into university or not is none of your business!

504
00:43:03,000 --> 00:43:05,699
None of your business at all!

505
00:43:05,700 --> 00:43:07,465
This year.

506
00:43:07,466 --> 00:43:08,699
Mommy!

507
00:43:08,700 --> 00:43:09,500
For sure, I can.

508
00:43:09,501 --> 00:43:11,799
What are you sure of?

509
00:43:11,800 --> 00:43:13,365
Going to university is one thing,

510
00:43:13,366 --> 00:43:15,399
but being in love with another boy, absolutely not!

511
00:43:15,399 --> 00:43:16,799
Dad, I won't allow you to say that!

512
00:43:16,800 --> 00:43:18,199
You shut your mouth!

513
00:43:18,200 --> 00:43:19,599
What are you staring at?

514
00:43:19,600 --> 00:43:21,300
Dad!

515
00:43:23,366 --> 00:43:25,465
I came to discuss this with your parents.

516
00:43:25,466 --> 00:43:27,066
Just stay out of it.

517
00:43:37,100 --> 00:43:39,966
Uncle. Auntie. Please give me one chance.

518
00:43:40,000 --> 00:43:43,699
I'm willing to face and handle any problems that arise,

519
00:43:43,700 --> 00:43:45,366
as long as you agree to let us see each other.

520
00:43:45,366 --> 00:43:47,565
- Even if hell freezes over, I won't allow it.
- Dad!

521
00:43:47,565 --> 00:43:49,199
- What are you raising your voice for?
- Dad.

522
00:43:49,200 --> 00:43:51,465
Enough, all of you!

523
00:43:51,466 --> 00:43:53,766
We don't have an answer for you now. Give us some time.

524
00:43:53,766 --> 00:43:56,466
- Lin Caizhu.
- Daddy!

525
00:43:58,700 --> 00:44:01,100
You go home first.

526
00:44:02,100 --> 00:44:03,966
I won't give up.

527
00:44:16,400 --> 00:44:18,700
I'll come and visit again another day.

528
00:44:28,600 --> 00:44:30,300
Xiang Haoting!

529
00:44:31,166 --> 00:44:33,200
Get back to wiping the windows.

530
00:44:50,666 --> 00:44:53,000
Go get a cup of tea for your dad.

531
00:45:08,100 --> 00:45:11,299
I really don't know what to say about him. It's too ridiculous.

532
00:45:12,166 --> 00:45:16,166
Daddy, have you noticed that the atmosphere around our home is a little strange lately?

533
00:45:16,166 --> 00:45:18,100
The two of you have less and less to talk about.

534
00:45:18,100 --> 00:45:20,999
When you see each other or open your mouths, it's to argue.

535
00:45:21,000 --> 00:45:23,199
You just take it easy and calm down first, I beg you.

536
00:45:23,199 --> 00:45:25,399
How can I calm down about something like this?

537
00:45:25,400 --> 00:45:26,899
I have to oppose it to the end!

538
00:45:26,900 --> 00:45:28,099
So what are you saying?

539
00:45:28,100 --> 00:45:30,900
Are you saying you're willing to disown your son?

540
00:45:30,900 --> 00:45:32,299
You think this is enough of a threat to him?

541
00:45:32,300 --> 00:45:34,600
Trust me. Our son will not care.

542
00:45:34,600 --> 00:45:37,499
He will just go and announce to the world and then leave home immediately.

543
00:45:37,499 --> 00:45:38,499
Is that what you want?

544
00:45:38,500 --> 00:45:39,466
Go then.

545
00:45:39,467 --> 00:45:42,400
Don't say things in anger, okay?

546
00:45:42,400 --> 00:45:46,299
Since our son was three, no one's been able to control him.

547
00:45:46,300 --> 00:45:49,099
He's been safe and healthy until now,

548
00:45:49,099 --> 00:45:50,965
not going out doing foolish things,

549
00:45:50,966 --> 00:45:53,499
and not getting into fights or hurting people means he's kind-hearted.

550
00:45:53,499 --> 00:45:57,699
The most important thing in a person is to be kind and to have a good heart.

551
00:45:57,700 --> 00:46:00,300
But what can we do now?

552
00:46:01,700 --> 00:46:03,000
How do I know what we can do now?

553
00:46:03,000 --> 00:46:06,366
I don't know either what we can do now!

554
00:46:09,000 --> 00:46:11,300
Think of a way.

555
00:46:14,200 --> 00:46:16,400
Dad.

556
00:46:17,200 --> 00:46:20,665
Okay, I know you love our son, I know you're worried about him.

557
00:46:20,665 --> 00:46:25,865
But I don't want my son to distance himself farther and farther away from us.

558
00:46:33,800 --> 00:46:37,699
I've noticed our son listens to

559
00:46:37,699 --> 00:46:40,900
that young boy.

560
00:46:42,066 --> 00:46:43,920
Does he?

561
00:46:49,840 --> 00:46:55,460
♫ I still don’t understand why you left ♫

562
00:46:55,460 --> 00:47:01,400
♫ I still don’t understand why I’m waiting ♫

563
00:47:01,400 --> 00:47:07,190
♫ Waiting for who will remember their responsibility ♫

564
00:47:07,190 --> 00:47:12,930
♫ I’m left at the original place wandering around alone ♫

565
00:47:12,930 --> 00:47:18,390
♫ When the blue sky and white clouds disappear ♫

566
00:47:18,390 --> 00:47:23,800
♫ When you take away the yellow sneakers and the red sweater ♫

567
00:47:23,800 --> 00:47:29,120
♫ When all the colors are gone along with you ♫

568
00:47:29,120 --> 00:47:35,780
♫ Only transparent tears that unceasingly fall accompany me ♫

569
00:47:35,780 --> 00:47:41,310
♫ I still don’t understand why you left ♫

570
00:47:41,310 --> 00:47:47,330
♫ I still don’t understand why I’m waiting ♫

571
00:47:47,330 --> 00:47:53,030
♫ Waiting for who will remember their responsibility ♫

572
00:47:53,030 --> 00:47:57,450
♫ I’m left at the original place wandering around alone ♫

573
00:47:57,450 --> 00:48:02,740
♫ When one story becomes two regrets ♫

574
00:48:02,740 --> 00:48:09,040
♫ Letting two hearts run towards two different futures ♫

575
00:48:09,040 --> 00:48:14,940
♫ All those that can’t be forgotten can only become regrets ♫

576
00:48:14,940 --> 00:48:21,940
♫ But I still can’t understand why the tears won’t stop ♫
