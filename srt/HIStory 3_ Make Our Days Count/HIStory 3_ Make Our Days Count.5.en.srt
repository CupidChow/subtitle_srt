14
00:02:40,883 --> 00:02:42,750
What's up with you?

15
00:02:44,850 --> 00:02:46,516
I'm sorry.

16
00:02:48,116 --> 00:02:50,116
You're in a bad mood?

17
00:02:55,283 --> 00:02:58,482
It's nothing. Seeing you makes me happy.

18
00:03:01,116 --> 00:03:03,282
It's okay. There's no need to act for me.

19
00:03:03,283 --> 00:03:05,550
If you're feeling sad then feel sad.

20
00:03:07,850 --> 00:03:10,183
Everyone feels sad once in a while.

21
00:03:13,783 --> 00:03:15,783
Do you want to hear a joke?

22
00:03:19,283 --> 00:03:22,040
I don't know if you'll think it's funny or not,

23
00:03:23,350 --> 00:03:25,816
but I think it's pretty funny.

24
00:03:29,050 --> 00:03:30,650
Do you want to hear it?

25
00:03:33,516 --> 00:03:35,616
Are you trying to make me laugh?

26
00:03:37,516 --> 00:03:39,350
You succeeded.

27
00:03:40,216 --> 00:03:42,049
But I haven't even told you yet.

28
00:03:42,050 --> 00:03:45,282
Do you know what you can do to make me feel happier?

29
00:03:47,850 --> 00:03:49,750
Say you like me.

30
00:03:55,416 --> 00:03:57,350
Let me kiss you.

31
00:03:59,383 --> 00:04:01,383
Or you kiss me.

32
00:04:09,116 --> 00:04:11,616
The one that's not happy right now is me.

33
00:04:18,516 --> 00:04:20,683
So do you want to hear the joke or not?

34
00:04:25,316 --> 00:04:28,416
Do you know which performer doesn't eat lunch?

35
00:04:29,816 --> 00:04:32,182
Mika Nakashima (Jung dao Mei jia).

36
00:04:32,183 --> 00:04:33,249
Why?

37
00:04:33,250 --> 00:04:35,600
Because she doesn't eat lunch.
(Taiwanese pronunciation means: doesn't eat lunch)

It's so late already, why haven't you gone home?

40
00:04:50,816 --> 00:04:52,983
Still angry at me?

41
00:04:55,550 --> 00:04:58,449
I know he's your closest brother.

42
00:04:58,450 --> 00:05:00,882
I'm sorry for upsetting you,

43
00:05:00,883 --> 00:05:03,016
but I really can't help him.

44
00:05:04,416 --> 00:05:06,550
Do you like him that much?

45
00:05:07,850 --> 00:05:11,616
I said, do you like him that much?

46
00:05:11,616 --> 00:05:13,549
Touch his head. Give him a job.

47
00:05:13,550 --> 00:05:16,682
Now, you won't even give permission for Xiang Haoting to go out with him.

48
00:05:16,683 --> 00:05:18,982
Are you talking about Little Gu?

49
00:05:18,983 --> 00:05:20,849
Who else?

50
00:05:20,850 --> 00:05:23,949
I just found out today that you knew him much longer than you knew me.

51
00:05:23,950 --> 00:05:26,082
But you already promised you would go out with me.

52
00:05:26,083 --> 00:05:27,415
You should forget about him

53
00:05:27,416 --> 00:05:30,349
and take whatever there is of him in your heart and get rid of it.

54
00:05:30,350 --> 00:05:32,415
Our age gap is too big.

55
00:05:32,416 --> 00:05:34,249
He's like a younger brother to me.

56
00:05:34,250 --> 00:05:36,510
I'm the same age as him.

57
00:05:37,316 --> 00:05:40,182
I don't like him in the same way I like you.

58
00:05:40,183 --> 00:05:42,216
He's a little brother.

59
00:05:48,350 --> 00:05:50,183
Do you understand now?

60
00:05:52,050 --> 00:05:54,250
You kiss me out in the open like this...

61
00:05:55,950 --> 00:05:58,316
Then I want another one.

62
00:06:11,683 --> 00:06:14,380
Hurry and go home.

63
00:06:15,050 --> 00:06:16,816
Quickly, hurry home.

64
00:06:18,250 --> 00:06:20,216

Recently, a lot of unbelievable things have happened,

67
00:06:41,550 --> 00:06:43,450
but it's all good things.

68
00:06:43,450 --> 00:06:45,550
All very fortunate things.

69
00:06:47,416 --> 00:06:49,583

97.5%!

72
00:07:04,616 --> 00:07:05,882
Good, very good.

Next, rivers are classed into four different categories.

74

What four categories are there?

75
00:07:11,250 --> 00:07:14,082
Glacial, groundwater,

76
00:07:14,083 --> 00:07:17,850
frost, surface water!

77
00:07:19,216 --> 00:07:21,884
Next. This is an important point. Take notes.

78
00:07:21,884 --> 00:07:24,315
Teacher Liu, can I borrow a student?

79
00:07:24,315 --> 00:07:26,149
Sure.

80
00:07:26,150 --> 00:07:28,150
Student Yu Shigu.

81
00:07:43,500 --> 00:07:45,270
Idiot.

82
00:07:51,750 --> 00:07:53,950
My heart's beating so fast.

83
00:07:59,216 --> 00:08:01,550
As I said, this is an apology drink.

84
00:08:03,116 --> 00:08:05,483
I'm apologizing for Brother Chigang.

85
00:08:07,916 --> 00:08:09,583
I accept.

86
00:08:13,350 --> 00:08:15,150
We're fine.

87
00:08:16,416 --> 00:08:22,115
And please apologize to your Brother Chigang for me, too.

88
00:08:22,115 --> 00:08:25,082
I was too rash and was really mean to him.

89
00:08:25,083 --> 00:08:27,216
I'm sorry.

90
00:08:29,383 --> 00:08:35,582
Also, I will need to ask him a lot about him in the future.

91
00:08:36,250 --> 00:08:38,182
I really can't believe you.

92
00:08:38,183 --> 00:08:40,550
So, just now, it was all about him?

93
00:08:40,551 --> 00:08:42,083
Yup!

94
00:08:42,983 --> 00:08:45,949
Fine. I know you really really love him.

95
00:08:45,950 --> 00:08:47,482
But you have to consider him, too.

96
00:08:47,483 --> 00:08:48,450
Why?

97
00:08:48,451 --> 00:08:49,882
He's an excellent student.

98
00:08:49,883 --> 00:08:53,016
So? I'm an excellent student, too.

99
00:08:53,016 --> 00:08:56,349
If because of you, he gets reported because of rumors,

100
00:08:56,350 --> 00:08:57,949
then what?

101
00:08:57,950 --> 00:08:59,215
Would that happen?

102
00:08:59,216 --> 00:09:01,350
That wouldn't happen!

103
00:09:03,050 --> 00:09:04,550
I've never considered that before.

104
00:09:04,550 --> 00:09:06,915
Don't look.

105
00:09:06,916 --> 00:09:08,082
Just one more look.

106
00:09:08,083 --> 00:09:09,983
Put it away.

107
00:09:12,550 --> 00:09:14,915
I can't help it.

108
00:09:14,916 --> 00:09:16,216
Come out!

109
00:09:19,350 --> 00:09:20,415
Bad hands!

110
00:09:20,416 --> 00:09:21,283
Bad!

111
00:09:21,284 --> 00:09:22,949
How can you do that?

112
00:09:22,950 --> 00:09:24,415
Not listening!

113
00:09:24,416 --> 00:09:25,316
Somethings happened!

114
00:09:25,317 --> 00:09:29,415
Yu Shigu's been asked to go to the schoolmaster's office.

115
00:09:31,483 --> 00:09:34,451
- Why?
- Someone reported him going to a gay bar.

116
00:09:35,983 --> 00:09:36,816
A-hao don't go!

117
00:09:36,816 --> 00:09:38,084
What are you guys doing?

118
00:09:38,084 --> 00:09:40,083
Where are you going?

119
00:09:41,450 --> 00:09:42,749
What?

120
00:09:42,750 --> 00:09:43,782
Why hold him back?

121
00:09:43,783 --> 00:09:44,716
Why can't we hold him back?

122
00:09:44,717 --> 00:09:46,115
Why?

123
00:09:46,116 --> 00:09:48,750
Yu Shigu's picture has your signature!

124
00:09:50,916 --> 00:09:55,015
Tell the schoolmaster! Did you really go into that place?

125
00:10:00,683 --> 00:10:01,782
If you did, you did. If you didn't, you didn't.

126
00:10:01,783 --> 00:10:03,149
Just tell us.

127
00:10:03,150 --> 00:10:04,849
What do you have to say to the schoolmaster?

128
00:10:04,850 --> 00:10:06,449
It's time to speak up now.

129
00:10:06,450 --> 00:10:09,483
If not, you may be reprehended by the school.

130
00:10:11,716 --> 00:10:13,215
Reporting!

131
00:10:13,216 --> 00:10:14,150
Xiang Haoting, what are you doing here?

132
00:10:14,151 --> 00:10:15,515
It's not your turn yet.

133
00:10:15,516 --> 00:10:17,015
Since you're here, let me ask you.

134
00:10:17,016 --> 00:10:18,482
You took this photo.

135
00:10:18,483 --> 00:10:21,083
Did Yu Shigu really go into this place?

136
00:10:24,150 --> 00:10:26,215
Why aren't you talking either?

137
00:10:26,216 --> 00:10:29,849
Didn't you sign this photo and put it into the schoolmaster's mailbox?

138
00:10:34,650 --> 00:10:36,815
Since I was the one that signed it,

139
00:10:36,816 --> 00:10:38,782
then I was the one that did it.

140
00:10:38,783 --> 00:10:41,616
Did he go into that bar or not?

141
00:10:43,783 --> 00:10:45,382
He never went to that place.

142
00:10:45,383 --> 00:10:46,815
What do you mean?

143
00:10:46,816 --> 00:10:48,816
Explain.

144
00:10:54,316 --> 00:10:57,749
I photoshopped this photo.

145
00:10:57,749 --> 00:11:00,766
It's a computerized composition.

146
00:11:08,100 --> 00:11:10,466
It really looks real.

147
00:11:13,016 --> 00:11:14,815
Xiang Haoting, you–

148
00:11:14,816 --> 00:11:16,782
What are you doing?

149
00:11:16,783 --> 00:11:19,329
I really can't put up with you anymore.

150
00:11:19,330 --> 00:11:21,750
Call his parents. I want to meet his parents.

151
00:11:25,916 --> 00:11:26,783
What is going on?

152
00:11:26,784 --> 00:11:28,715
Seriously, who was the one that took the photo.

153
00:11:28,716 --> 00:11:30,415
The point is...

154
00:11:30,416 --> 00:11:33,015
You're back!

155
00:11:33,016 --> 00:11:33,950
Is everything all right?

156
00:11:33,951 --> 00:11:35,783
Wait!

157
00:11:36,616 --> 00:11:38,410
Was everything cleared up?

158
00:11:39,383 --> 00:11:40,649
Tell us quickly!

159
00:11:40,650 --> 00:11:43,183
Didn't A-hao go to the schoolmaster's office and deny it was him?

160
00:11:43,183 --> 00:11:46,016
He even said he was going to speak for you, say you didn't go to the gay bar.

161
00:11:47,150 --> 00:11:49,782
He said the photo was a digital mock-up.

162
00:11:49,783 --> 00:11:52,316
How does he know it's a digital mock-up?

163
00:11:53,750 --> 00:11:55,570
Answer me!

164
00:11:56,250 --> 00:11:58,882
He has the same exact photo on his cell phone.

165
00:11:58,883 --> 00:12:00,890
Impossible!

166
00:12:01,816 --> 00:12:04,549
But if the photo is a mock-up,

167
00:12:04,550 --> 00:12:07,249
then it means the whole thing is fake.

168
00:12:07,250 --> 00:12:08,282
Yes.

169
00:12:08,283 --> 00:12:10,949
Then, where's A-hao now?

170
00:12:10,950 --> 00:12:13,215
He said he was the one that mocked up the photo.

171
00:12:13,216 --> 00:12:15,350
That's impossible!

172
00:12:16,450 --> 00:12:18,549
Please tell us exactly what happened.

173
00:12:18,550 --> 00:12:20,916
What happened just now?

174
00:12:22,016 --> 00:12:23,382
You're still so young and don't want to learn.

175
00:12:23,383 --> 00:12:24,449
What are you doing mocking up photos for?

176
00:12:24,450 --> 00:12:28,182
Okay, whatever it is, let's discuss it when we get home.

177
00:12:28,182 --> 00:12:29,382
Schoolmaster Song, we're sorry.

178
00:12:29,383 --> 00:12:31,615
Our Haoting has often caused you much trouble.

179
00:12:31,616 --> 00:12:34,149
Thank you for showing so much patience in dealing with him.

180
00:12:34,150 --> 00:12:37,415
Asking you to come today is to let you know the situation.

181
00:12:37,415 --> 00:12:38,715
Yes.

182
00:12:38,716 --> 00:12:40,515
I'll ask you one more time.

183
00:12:40,516 --> 00:12:42,249
Where did the photo come from?

184
00:12:42,250 --> 00:12:44,415
Didn't I say Liu Meifang from Class 5 gave it to me?

185
00:12:44,416 --> 00:12:47,182
You. If you don't believe me, you can go ask her.

186
00:12:47,182 --> 00:12:49,082
What's with your attitude?

187
00:12:49,083 --> 00:12:50,849
Speak politely to the schoolmaster.

188
00:12:50,850 --> 00:12:51,915
I don't really like him.

189
00:12:51,916 --> 00:12:52,949
Xiang Haoting!

190
00:12:52,950 --> 00:12:54,982
Because of him, Sun Boxiang and the guys had to sweep for a week.

191
00:12:54,983 --> 00:12:56,049
I had to get back at him.

192
00:12:56,050 --> 00:12:58,349
What's it have to do with you? Are you that bored?

193
00:12:58,349 --> 00:12:59,615
If you wanted to get him in trouble,

194
00:12:59,616 --> 00:13:02,483
then why confess now and say that you mocked up the photo?

195
00:13:04,216 --> 00:13:06,016
Because...

196
00:13:08,383 --> 00:13:10,149
my dad taught me

197
00:13:10,150 --> 00:13:13,482
My dad said a man must take responsibility for his own actions. Right?

198
00:13:13,482 --> 00:13:15,782
I was the one that signed the photo; of course, I have to take responsibility for it.

199
00:13:15,783 --> 00:13:17,950
What are you being so arrogant about? So cocky!

200
00:13:17,950 --> 00:13:18,916
You think you're in the right now?

201
00:13:18,917 --> 00:13:20,549
Enough, Dad!

202
00:13:20,550 --> 00:13:23,915
Let's not do this at school and hit him.

203
00:13:23,915 --> 00:13:25,583
Let's talk about it when we get home.

204
00:13:25,583 --> 00:13:26,549
I'm sorry, schoolmaster.

205
00:13:26,550 --> 00:13:27,582
It's okay.

206
00:13:27,583 --> 00:13:29,449
Are you confessing now all of this was done by you alone?

207
00:13:29,450 --> 00:13:30,782
The school will have to reprimand you,

208
00:13:30,783 --> 00:13:31,815
and it won't be light.

209
00:13:31,816 --> 00:13:33,916
You better think clearly about this!

210
00:13:36,516 --> 00:13:38,249
It was me.

211
00:13:38,250 --> 00:13:39,382
Are you telling the truth?

212
00:13:39,383 --> 00:13:41,082
I'm telling the truth!

213
00:13:41,083 --> 00:13:43,782
It's because he was acting very arrogant, so I wanted to teach him a lesson. That's all.

214
00:13:43,782 --> 00:13:45,783
You doing this. What are you being so cocky for?

215
00:13:45,783 --> 00:13:47,149
Why do you do this all the time?

216
00:13:47,150 --> 00:13:48,016
Dad!

217
00:13:48,016 --> 00:13:49,016
Stop that.

218
00:13:49,017 --> 00:13:51,750
Dad Xiang.

219
00:13:51,750 --> 00:13:53,982
Such an embarrassment!

220
00:13:53,983 --> 00:13:56,251
Since he's admitted that it was all done by himself,

221
00:13:56,251 --> 00:13:59,182
the school will have a discussion to see what the punishment will be.

222
00:13:59,182 --> 00:14:01,483
We'll contact you once it's been decided.

223
00:14:03,383 --> 00:14:04,983
We're sorry.

224
00:14:04,983 --> 00:14:07,649
Thank you, schoolmaster.

225
00:14:07,650 --> 00:14:10,450
Dad.

226
00:14:11,616 --> 00:14:13,882
Schoolmaster, I'm sorry.

227
00:14:13,883 --> 00:14:17,149
Then we'll wait for the school to get back to us.

228
00:14:17,150 --> 00:14:19,415
But our Xiang Haoting,

229
00:14:19,416 --> 00:14:21,015
he's already in his third year of high school.

230
00:14:21,016 --> 00:14:23,782
We hope that he can still graduate and continue with college.

231
00:14:23,782 --> 00:14:25,216
So, I hope the schoolmaster will help us.

232
00:14:25,216 --> 00:14:26,383
I will let the school know.

233
00:14:26,383 --> 00:14:28,183
Thank you.

234
00:14:36,150 --> 00:14:40,549
Teacher, I'm sorry for disturbing your class.

235
00:14:44,050 --> 00:14:45,483
A-hao.

236
00:14:48,083 --> 00:14:49,450
A-hao.

237
00:14:50,783 --> 00:14:52,750
Please continue, all of you.

238
00:14:57,516 --> 00:15:00,183
Okay, students. Let's continue with class!

239
00:15:13,316 --> 00:15:14,649
That's way too much!

240
00:15:14,650 --> 00:15:16,950
A major demerit along with five days of suspension.

241
00:15:16,950 --> 00:15:18,716
Think about the good side.

242
00:15:18,716 --> 00:15:21,882
A-hao is probably having a good time at home. He doesn't need to go to class.

243
00:15:21,882 --> 00:15:23,315
No way!

244
00:15:23,316 --> 00:15:26,515
Not wanting to come and not being able to come are two different things.

245
00:15:26,516 --> 00:15:27,384
That's true.

246
00:15:27,384 --> 00:15:29,683
If I see that guy,

247
00:15:32,083 --> 00:15:33,783
I'll kill him for sure.

248
00:15:39,116 --> 00:15:40,283
Think about it guys.

249
00:15:40,283 --> 00:15:43,950
This whole thing could have been planned by Yu Shigu himself.

250
00:15:43,950 --> 00:15:47,415
What you're saying is he's taking revenge for the mid-term exam?

251
00:15:48,316 --> 00:15:50,415
You guys are overthinking this,

252
00:15:50,416 --> 00:15:52,882
and blaming Yu Shigu for all of it.

253
00:15:52,883 --> 00:15:55,403
You're not afraid that Xiang Haoting would come after you guys?

254
00:16:03,616 --> 00:16:05,150
I'm going.

255
00:16:18,516 --> 00:16:20,116
Yu Shigu.

256
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:26,933
- You...
- I just wanted to let you know,

257
00:16:26,933 --> 00:16:29,300
this thing wasn't done by Xiang Haoting.

258
00:16:34,300 --> 00:16:37,066
You have to believe what that fool said.

259
00:16:39,016 --> 00:16:42,382
He wasn't the one that did it. That's all.

260
00:16:43,566 --> 00:16:45,933
There is one thing that I need your help with.

261
00:16:47,766 --> 00:16:49,699
No matter how much Xiang Haoting hates Yu Shigu,

262
00:16:49,700 --> 00:16:51,699
he wouldn't do that to him.

263
00:16:51,700 --> 00:16:54,100
This isn't his style of doing things.

264
00:16:54,700 --> 00:16:57,165
But he signed his name on the photo.

265
00:16:57,166 --> 00:16:59,365
It's not about the signature.

266
00:16:59,366 --> 00:17:02,133
When he really hates someone, he would confront them directly.

267
00:17:02,133 --> 00:17:04,565
He wouldn't bother going through the school or teachers

268
00:17:04,566 --> 00:17:05,832
and relying on people snitching.

269
00:17:05,832 --> 00:17:09,366
So that's why they all disliked Yu Shigu so much before.

270
00:17:11,766 --> 00:17:13,999
But he really did ask me for the photo.

271
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:16,033
The schoolmaster even asked me down to ask me.

272
00:17:16,033 --> 00:17:18,099
Why did you give it to him?

273
00:17:18,100 --> 00:17:19,365
He tricked me.

274
00:17:19,366 --> 00:17:21,000
Dumby.

275
00:17:21,800 --> 00:17:23,199
Are you sure you're the only one that has that photo?

276
00:17:23,200 --> 00:17:25,533
Of course. Even though we exchange photos often,

277
00:17:25,533 --> 00:17:28,365
that one's so cute, it's for my personal collection.

278
00:17:28,366 --> 00:17:31,599
And for Xiang Haoting.

279
00:17:31,600 --> 00:17:33,200
Positive?

280
00:17:35,233 --> 00:17:38,399
- Tingan.
- Tingan?

281
00:17:38,400 --> 00:17:40,565
Zhang Tingan?

282
00:17:40,566 --> 00:17:42,632
Really?

283
00:17:42,633 --> 00:17:44,599
That time when we went to eat cake,

284
00:17:44,600 --> 00:17:47,199
after you left, he asked me for it.

285
00:17:47,200 --> 00:17:49,365
What did he want Yu Shigu's picture for?

286
00:17:49,366 --> 00:17:50,665
I don't know.

287
00:17:50,666 --> 00:17:52,690
I'm sorry! I'm sorry!

288
00:17:53,633 --> 00:17:55,599
Sorry for keeping you waiting so long.

289
00:17:55,600 --> 00:17:57,565
Oh my, I'm so tired.

290
00:17:57,566 --> 00:17:59,800
You mocked up the photo?

291
00:18:00,566 --> 00:18:01,900
What photo?

292
00:18:01,900 --> 00:18:05,565
- The one with Yu Shigu.
- What are you talking about?

293
00:18:05,600 --> 00:18:09,465
- Did you see the letter from Xiang Haoting to me?
- Which one?

294
00:18:09,465 --> 00:18:13,332
It's can't be Tingan. Didn't Xiang Haoting already confess?

295
00:18:16,350 --> 00:18:18,715
Did you mock-up that photo?

296
00:18:18,716 --> 00:18:20,549
I don't know what you're talking about.

297
00:18:20,550 --> 00:18:22,449
You clearly saw that letter he wrote to me.

298
00:18:22,450 --> 00:18:25,615
- The one that he signed.
- There are so many, they all look the same.

299
00:18:25,615 --> 00:18:29,582
Don't lie to me. Zhang Tingan!

300
00:18:31,816 --> 00:18:33,490
It was me.

301
00:18:34,416 --> 00:18:37,815
It was me that mocked up the photo and forged Xiang Haoting's signature.

302
00:18:37,815 --> 00:18:39,349
Why did you do that?

303
00:18:39,350 --> 00:18:41,282
I was getting revenge for you.

304
00:18:41,283 --> 00:18:43,449
Who asked him to treat you like that?

305
00:18:43,450 --> 00:18:45,930
Let's go clear it up with the schoolmaster!

306
00:18:45,930 --> 00:18:48,350
What are you doing? I'm not going.

307
00:18:48,350 --> 00:18:49,549
What do you mean you're not?

308
00:18:49,550 --> 00:18:51,750
If you didn't cry your eyes out like that and weren't that depressed,

309
00:18:51,751 --> 00:18:53,149
I wouldn't have to do something like this!

310
00:18:53,150 --> 00:18:54,883
You're really low!

311
00:18:57,750 --> 00:19:00,883
What you just said really hurts.

312
00:19:01,750 --> 00:19:04,350
Have you ever considered me a good friend?

313
00:19:05,650 --> 00:19:08,450
Someone who would do something like this isn't fit to be my friend.

314
00:19:11,316 --> 00:19:16,882
Li Shiyu, do you know that I have always liked you?

315
00:19:20,483 --> 00:19:24,182
Forget it. Do whatever you want.

316
00:19:26,150 --> 00:19:27,916
Tingan!

317
00:19:59,616 --> 00:20:02,749
Speak. What do you want?

318
00:20:16,916 --> 00:20:18,549
Got a beating and being suspended,

319
00:20:18,550 --> 00:20:22,249
you still have the mood to sing and play with your phone.

320
00:20:22,249 --> 00:20:23,616
What?

321
00:20:26,583 --> 00:20:28,482
Who gave it to you?

322
00:20:28,483 --> 00:20:32,115
♪ Hitting my children ♪

323
00:20:32,116 --> 00:20:35,316
♪ Pain in my heart ♪

324
00:20:36,716 --> 00:20:39,216
That's impolite; copying Dad.

325
00:20:43,650 --> 00:20:45,183
Come on!

326
00:20:47,983 --> 00:20:49,449
Wipe it down yourself!

327
00:20:49,450 --> 00:20:51,416
That hurts!

328
00:20:58,216 --> 00:20:59,782
What did you see?

329
00:20:59,783 --> 00:21:02,682
Who is it? Why do you care so much?

330
00:21:02,682 --> 00:21:04,049
Not telling you.

331
00:21:04,050 --> 00:21:06,083
Who cares?

332
00:21:14,383 --> 00:21:16,650
So mean.

333
00:21:44,050 --> 00:21:46,215
Long time no see.

334
00:21:46,216 --> 00:21:48,650
What is it? You're looking for me.

335
00:21:49,916 --> 00:21:52,983
There's something I need to apologize for.

336
00:21:53,950 --> 00:21:55,783
What thing?

337
00:21:59,583 --> 00:22:01,716
The photo incident.

338
00:22:06,450 --> 00:22:09,015
You're the one that did it!

339
00:22:09,016 --> 00:22:11,249
Half-true.

340
00:22:11,250 --> 00:22:14,315
How did you know about the bar?

341
00:22:14,316 --> 00:22:16,449
I didn't know about the bar.

342
00:22:16,450 --> 00:22:20,549
I was walking with Sister Meifang and just happen to see Yu Shigu walk in.

343
00:22:20,550 --> 00:22:22,015
And then?

344
00:22:22,016 --> 00:22:23,382
There's no and then.

345
00:22:23,383 --> 00:22:25,416
We just saw it.

346
00:22:28,416 --> 00:22:30,482
You scared me!

347
00:22:30,483 --> 00:22:33,016
Good thing I'm quick to react!

348
00:22:33,850 --> 00:22:36,249
I'm really something!

349
00:22:36,250 --> 00:22:38,282
You're not mad?

350
00:22:38,283 --> 00:22:39,870
Nope.

351
00:22:40,583 --> 00:22:42,349
But I still want to go tell the schoolmaster--

352
00:22:42,350 --> 00:22:43,983
Don't do that.

353
00:22:45,816 --> 00:22:47,082
Yu Shigu is not a very good talker.

354
00:22:47,083 --> 00:22:49,950
If you tell the schoolmaster, things will for sure...

355
00:22:52,283 --> 00:22:55,782
When did you start to know Yu Shigu so well?

356
00:22:55,783 --> 00:22:58,282
Are you protecting him?

357
00:22:58,283 --> 00:23:00,749
Yes, I'm protecting him.

358
00:23:00,749 --> 00:23:02,116
Why do you want to protect him?

359
00:23:02,116 --> 00:23:04,115
Didn't you used to hate him before?

360
00:23:04,116 --> 00:23:06,149
Now,

361
00:23:06,150 --> 00:23:08,015
as long as he's doing well,

362
00:23:08,016 --> 00:23:09,915
then I'm happy.

363
00:23:09,916 --> 00:23:12,216
Isn't this what it's like to like someone?

364
00:23:14,983 --> 00:23:18,583
Like before when you liked me and I liked you, that kind of like?

365
00:23:19,749 --> 00:23:22,815
I like Yu Shigu.

366
00:23:22,816 --> 00:23:25,083
I really like him!

367
00:23:31,550 --> 00:23:33,482
Thank you.

368
00:23:33,483 --> 00:23:38,282
After telling you just now, I feel so much better. YES!

369
00:23:38,282 --> 00:23:40,749
Xiang Haoting, you really are crazy.

370
00:23:40,750 --> 00:23:42,382
That's what my dad says.

371
00:23:42,383 --> 00:23:43,750
Bye!

372
00:23:47,050 --> 00:23:49,383
Good thing I broke up with him already.

373
00:24:27,816 --> 00:24:29,783
That really hurts! What are you doing?

374
00:24:29,783 --> 00:24:31,615
Who asked you to eavesdrop?

375
00:24:31,616 --> 00:24:35,016
I'm going to close the door in a bit. When I open it and if you're still there,

376
00:24:35,016 --> 00:24:36,749
what's going to hurt won't just be your ears.

377
00:24:36,750 --> 00:24:38,483
Get out.

378
00:24:46,650 --> 00:24:48,250
Take a seat on my bed first.

379
00:24:50,116 --> 00:24:51,816
No need.

380
00:24:56,383 --> 00:25:00,450
How do you know where my house is?

381
00:25:00,450 --> 00:25:02,382
I asked Sun Boxiang.

382
00:25:02,383 --> 00:25:04,383
I have something to tell you.

383
00:25:06,850 --> 00:25:08,149
Agreeing to be with me?

384
00:25:08,150 --> 00:25:09,949
No.

385
00:25:09,950 --> 00:25:13,615
What I want to say is I know you didn't do it.

386
00:25:19,383 --> 00:25:21,483
How do you know it wasn't me?

387
00:25:25,216 --> 00:25:27,450
You're not that type of person.

388
00:25:32,250 --> 00:25:34,750
You understand me so well.

389
00:25:35,916 --> 00:25:37,615
I don't care if you believe me or not.

390
00:25:37,616 --> 00:25:39,549
I know you had nothing to do with it.

391
00:25:39,550 --> 00:25:42,049
It must be because of the mid-term exam.

392
00:25:42,050 --> 00:25:43,782
They all thought you hated m,

393
00:25:43,783 --> 00:25:46,049
so they used this to get back at me.

394
00:25:46,050 --> 00:25:49,182
You could've not come to the schoolmaster's office.

395
00:25:49,183 --> 00:25:51,316
- But...
- But I went.

396
00:25:52,516 --> 00:25:54,349
And I said I did it.

397
00:25:54,350 --> 00:25:55,849
I said the photo was mocked up by me.

398
00:25:55,850 --> 00:25:57,815
Actually, you've never been to the bar.

399
00:25:57,816 --> 00:26:00,983
Then I got a major demerit and was locked up at home.

400
00:26:03,250 --> 00:26:06,083
I know you understand in your heart...

401
00:26:10,216 --> 00:26:12,616
I like you.

402
00:26:15,850 --> 00:26:18,216
I believe you understand.

403
00:26:19,083 --> 00:26:21,016
Because I know...

404
00:26:22,550 --> 00:26:24,683
that you have already started to like me.

405
00:26:25,483 --> 00:26:27,340
I don't!

406
00:26:28,116 --> 00:26:29,582
No?

407
00:26:29,583 --> 00:26:32,682
Liu Meifang LINEd 132 of your photos to me.

408
00:26:32,683 --> 00:26:35,015
How's that possible?

409
00:26:35,016 --> 00:26:37,783
Don't deny it; I have proof.

410
00:26:39,616 --> 00:26:41,516
This one.

411
00:26:41,516 --> 00:26:44,590
You're looking right at me.

412
00:26:45,650 --> 00:26:48,383
I used red circles to mark them.

413
00:26:52,616 --> 00:26:54,850
You still want to deny it.

414
00:26:58,350 --> 00:27:01,740
Yes, I was looking at you.

415
00:27:02,349 --> 00:27:04,215
You're admitting it?

416
00:27:04,216 --> 00:27:06,615
And you said you didn't like me.

417
00:27:06,616 --> 00:27:09,849
It's not like, it's because I'm curious.

418
00:27:09,849 --> 00:27:11,483
Curious?

419
00:27:12,483 --> 00:27:14,050
About what?

420
00:27:15,816 --> 00:27:20,116
Just... You know how much I care about grades?

421
00:27:21,116 --> 00:27:23,483
So I will always go look at the school rankings.

422
00:27:25,783 --> 00:27:27,915
After the 2nd year exams,

423
00:27:27,916 --> 00:27:29,782
didn't you get the second highest mark in the school?

424
00:27:29,783 --> 00:27:31,315
Yeah.

425
00:27:31,316 --> 00:27:33,149
We were only 4 marks different,

426
00:27:33,150 --> 00:27:36,316
so I thought you were my competitor.

427
00:27:38,150 --> 00:27:40,949
Wait. No way!

428
00:27:40,950 --> 00:27:45,250
So, you started noticing me because of this?

429
00:27:45,250 --> 00:27:46,415
Yeah.

430
00:27:46,416 --> 00:27:48,183
I thought...

431
00:27:49,583 --> 00:27:51,383
I thought...

432
00:27:53,816 --> 00:27:55,449
But after that time,

433
00:27:55,450 --> 00:27:58,215
you started to rank starting from the worst place.

434
00:27:58,216 --> 00:28:01,715
So I thought you were pretty unique.

435
00:28:01,715 --> 00:28:03,849
Do what you want to do.

436
00:28:03,850 --> 00:28:06,349
Whatever your heart desires. No restrictions.

437
00:28:06,349 --> 00:28:08,450
And don't even care what others think.

438
00:28:09,816 --> 00:28:12,815
Just like you've got the whole world in the palm of your hand.

439
00:28:12,815 --> 00:28:14,949
Don't flatter me too much.

440
00:28:14,950 --> 00:28:17,215
I'm not trying to flatter you.

441
00:28:17,216 --> 00:28:19,383
I really do envy you.

442
00:28:20,716 --> 00:28:23,882
I can never be like you.

443
00:28:23,883 --> 00:28:25,483
Why?

444
00:28:25,483 --> 00:28:28,250
I don't want to be a burden to others.

445
00:28:28,250 --> 00:28:31,015
I also can't be a burden to others.

446
00:28:31,015 --> 00:28:32,815
You're not.

447
00:28:32,816 --> 00:28:37,116
Doing what makes you happy, how can that be a burden?

448
00:28:37,116 --> 00:28:39,983
This is what I envy about you the most.

449
00:28:40,950 --> 00:28:43,249
I was raised by my aunt.

450
00:28:43,250 --> 00:28:47,415
She later got married and had kids.

451
00:28:47,416 --> 00:28:49,782
She got tired.

452
00:28:49,783 --> 00:28:54,183
I needed to be independent, needed to be strong,

453
00:28:54,183 --> 00:28:56,150
needed to learn to rely on myself.

454
00:28:58,716 --> 00:29:01,649
I really wanted to be like you.

455
00:29:01,650 --> 00:29:05,049
Laugh when I felt like laughing, be angry when I felt mad,

456
00:29:05,050 --> 00:29:07,515
and be able to get along with everyone so well.

457
00:29:07,516 --> 00:29:10,115
Getting punished, or getting demerits,

458
00:29:10,116 --> 00:29:11,983
not needing to care about them.

459
00:29:14,316 --> 00:29:16,216
That's how I saw you.

460
00:29:18,683 --> 00:29:21,783
I felt like I gained a little freedom, too.

461
00:29:24,683 --> 00:29:29,383
You know? After getting to know you,

462
00:29:29,383 --> 00:29:33,815
I started to think and feel that

463
00:29:35,450 --> 00:29:38,816
if my parents didn't leave me when I was so young,

464
00:29:42,316 --> 00:29:45,216
would everything be different?

465
00:29:48,750 --> 00:29:52,090
Would everything be different than it is today?

466
00:29:52,090 --> 00:29:55,760
♫ Let yourself be fragile for once ♫

467
00:29:55,760 --> 00:30:00,600
♫ I will be like this in front of you ♫

468
00:30:00,600 --> 00:30:06,900
♫ At the time that you need it, gently say ‘Hey’ ♫

469
00:30:15,083 --> 00:30:18,549
Starting from today, you have me.

470
00:30:20,616 --> 00:30:24,383
I will give you my everything

471
00:30:44,183 --> 00:30:48,115
Also, his sister told me, his dad slapped him.

472
00:30:48,115 --> 00:30:50,849
And his face got all red.

473
00:30:50,850 --> 00:30:52,815
If that person really wanted to frame him,

474
00:30:52,816 --> 00:30:54,749
then it's pretty bad for Little Gu,

475
00:30:54,750 --> 00:30:57,015
to get caught up in all of this.

476
00:30:57,016 --> 00:30:58,849
It's true if you put it that way.

477
00:30:58,850 --> 00:31:01,515
But Xiang Haoting kept protecting him.

478
00:31:01,516 --> 00:31:05,815
I'm telling you. As long as Little Gu doesn't go out with him, nothing will happen to him.

479
00:31:06,683 --> 00:31:09,049
Don't hate Xiang Haoting.

480
00:31:09,050 --> 00:31:11,549
If you got to know him longer,

481
00:31:11,550 --> 00:31:13,482
you'd know that he's a real man.

482
00:31:13,483 --> 00:31:16,515
He's only in his teens, how could he be a real man?

483
00:31:16,516 --> 00:31:19,116
Stop bringing up age all the time.

484
00:31:23,183 --> 00:31:24,990
You're mad?

485
00:31:25,916 --> 00:31:27,783
You get mad so easily.

486
00:31:27,783 --> 00:31:30,440
This proves that you're still a young boy.

487
00:31:31,083 --> 00:31:33,783
But you're my little boy.

488
00:31:35,783 --> 00:31:37,215
Forget it.

489
00:31:37,216 --> 00:31:39,915
This Sunday my cousin has me closing up the gym.

490
00:31:39,916 --> 00:31:43,482
Could you come to work out later that day,

491
00:31:43,483 --> 00:31:45,915
then be with me when I close up shop?

492
00:31:45,916 --> 00:31:47,282
Sure.

493
00:31:47,283 --> 00:31:49,815
That's perfect, I'm not working that day either.

494
00:31:49,816 --> 00:31:51,383
Let's go.

495
00:32:00,116 --> 00:32:01,649
Is this okay?

496
00:32:01,650 --> 00:32:02,682
Okay.

497
00:32:02,683 --> 00:32:04,183
Let's go.

498
00:32:35,783 --> 00:32:37,383
Good morning.

499
00:32:39,183 --> 00:32:40,983
Your breakfast.

500
00:32:46,883 --> 00:32:48,950
I missed you.

501
00:32:51,316 --> 00:32:53,182
Why did you sneak over?

502
00:32:53,183 --> 00:32:55,749
I prepared breakfast already.

503
00:32:55,750 --> 00:32:57,615
You're just eating that?

504
00:32:57,616 --> 00:32:59,615
Don't eat that.

505
00:32:59,616 --> 00:33:01,516
Eat what I prepared.

506
00:33:02,616 --> 00:33:04,150
Thanks.

507
00:33:06,616 --> 00:33:08,615
You came all this way to just give me this?

508
00:33:08,616 --> 00:33:10,283
Of course.

509
00:33:15,316 --> 00:33:19,215
Actually I have something else really important to ask for your help on.

510
00:33:20,183 --> 00:33:22,849
It's just that my dad is still pretty angry.

511
00:33:22,850 --> 00:33:25,615
I was thinking of doing better on the final exams,

512
00:33:25,616 --> 00:33:27,350
so he'll be happier.

513
00:33:30,683 --> 00:33:33,483
Currently the second from last ranking is begging you for your help.

514
00:33:35,316 --> 00:33:37,282
The finals are next next week.

515
00:33:37,283 --> 00:33:40,549
It's fine. You're great with your school work.

516
00:33:40,550 --> 00:33:42,482
It's definitely not a problem for you.

517
00:33:42,483 --> 00:33:45,815
Besides I'm pretty intelligent.

518
00:33:48,950 --> 00:33:53,882
I... When I'm not working part-time, I'm at school.

519
00:33:53,882 --> 00:33:55,515
But lately due to entrance exams,

520
00:33:55,516 --> 00:33:58,149
I've taken on fewer hours for part-time work.

521
00:33:58,150 --> 00:33:59,749
Especially on the weekends.

522
00:33:59,750 --> 00:34:01,382
Then weekends it is.

523
00:34:01,383 --> 00:34:03,049
That's good, right?

524
00:34:03,050 --> 00:34:05,482
I'll come by your place at 1:00 in the afternoon on the weekend.

525
00:34:05,483 --> 00:34:08,216
Yes, sir! Thank you, Teacher Yu.

526
00:34:09,150 --> 00:34:10,715
Okay, hurry up and go home;

527
00:34:10,716 --> 00:34:12,483
or else, you'll get yelled at again.

528
00:34:17,483 --> 00:34:19,350
I'm heading to class.

529
00:34:24,983 --> 00:34:26,249
You like this?

530
00:34:26,250 --> 00:34:28,382
Don't you think it's very cute?

531
00:34:28,383 --> 00:34:30,449
What's it called?

532
00:34:30,450 --> 00:34:33,050
It doesn't have a name.

533
00:34:36,283 --> 00:34:38,716
Then just call him Whitey.

534
00:34:40,116 --> 00:34:42,190
Whitey?

535
00:34:43,983 --> 00:34:47,315
Whitey

536
00:34:47,316 --> 00:34:50,383
Whitey, have some jello.

537
00:34:52,983 --> 00:34:54,816
Little Yu,

538
00:34:55,750 --> 00:34:57,850
have some chocolate.

539
00:35:11,783 --> 00:35:12,716
Yes, Mrs. Fu.

540
00:35:12,716 --> 00:35:16,883
Yes, I know. Mrs. Lee's dog didn't do it on purpose.

541
00:35:20,850 --> 00:35:22,583
Of course, I know.

542
00:35:22,583 --> 00:35:25,582
You know that dogs are all like that.

543
00:35:25,583 --> 00:35:27,383
Not very.

544
00:35:30,616 --> 00:35:32,616
You're so beautiful today.

545
00:35:36,983 --> 00:35:39,149
Yes, good.

546
00:35:39,150 --> 00:35:41,415
I'll go speak to her. No problem.

547
00:35:41,416 --> 00:35:42,950
It's time, I'm going to change.

548
00:35:42,950 --> 00:35:44,350
That. Okay, I will take care of it.

549
00:35:44,350 --> 00:35:46,616
Okay, bye.

550
00:35:46,616 --> 00:35:48,549
What's gotten into him today?

551
00:35:48,550 --> 00:35:50,215
He better not cause any more trouble for me.

552
00:35:50,216 --> 00:35:53,983
He said he has a friend coming over to help him with homework.

553
00:35:54,516 --> 00:35:55,649
He's trying to be studious?

554
00:35:55,650 --> 00:35:57,316
Who knows?

555
00:35:58,383 --> 00:35:59,950
I'll get it!

556
00:36:02,716 --> 00:36:04,482
Friend's a girl?

557
00:36:04,483 --> 00:36:07,650
If it's a girl, we'll have to keep the door open later.

558
00:36:10,650 --> 00:36:12,250
- Yu Shigu.
- Uncle. Auntie. How are you?

559
00:36:12,250 --> 00:36:15,749
I'm Haoting's classmate. My name's Yu Shigu.

560
00:36:15,750 --> 00:36:18,382
He's good.

561
00:36:18,383 --> 00:36:20,050
He's pretty amazing. From the first year until now,

562
00:36:20,051 --> 00:36:22,115
he's always placed first in school!

563
00:36:22,116 --> 00:36:24,449
He really is the legendary bookworm. He never fails.

564
00:36:24,449 --> 00:36:25,515
Xiang Haoting.

565
00:36:25,516 --> 00:36:26,882
That's so great. Welcome.

566
00:36:26,883 --> 00:36:29,582
Our house has never had a guest with such good grades before.

567
00:36:29,583 --> 00:36:30,815
Come, sit.

568
00:36:30,816 --> 00:36:32,190
Dad!

569
00:36:35,450 --> 00:36:37,349
He came to help me with my homework.

570
00:36:37,350 --> 00:36:38,815
Don't take up his time.

571
00:36:38,816 --> 00:36:40,316
Okay, okay.

572
00:36:40,316 --> 00:36:42,416
Go and study hard. Make the most of your time.

573
00:36:42,416 --> 00:36:45,082
Do you want anything to eat or drink? Auntie will prepare something.

574
00:36:45,082 --> 00:36:47,550
Thank you, Auntie. We're okay.

575
00:36:52,350 --> 00:36:53,682
Mommy,

576
00:36:53,683 --> 00:36:56,283
I've seen this guy's photo in brother's phone before.

577
00:36:56,283 --> 00:36:59,223
He wouldn't let me eavesdrop on their conversation last time either.

578
00:37:00,816 --> 00:37:02,983
I think something strange is going on.

579
00:37:05,016 --> 00:37:07,215
It's okay, it's a boy anyway.

580
00:37:07,216 --> 00:37:09,716
Since it's a guest, of course, we'll have to prepare something to eat.

581
00:37:09,716 --> 00:37:11,316
Right.

582
00:37:20,750 --> 00:37:23,349
I've noted some main points.

583
00:37:23,350 --> 00:37:25,983
Memorize them. I'll test you in a little bit.

584
00:37:29,016 --> 00:37:30,620
Stay with me.

585
00:37:31,416 --> 00:37:33,315
Teach me.

586
00:37:33,316 --> 00:37:35,549
Stay with me. Teach me.

587
00:37:35,551 --> 00:37:37,183
You said you wanted your dad to be happy.

588
00:37:37,183 --> 00:37:39,382
You coming already makes my dad happy.

589
00:37:39,383 --> 00:37:41,982
You said you really wanted to study and not waste my time.

590
00:37:41,982 --> 00:37:43,850
I am.

591
00:37:45,516 --> 00:37:48,649
Okay. Focus.

592
00:37:50,783 --> 00:37:52,283
I'll read.

593
00:37:53,616 --> 00:37:55,283
I finished reading.

594
00:37:59,816 --> 00:38:01,550
Fine.

595
00:38:07,716 --> 00:38:11,482
A disciple should treat their teacher with humility,

596
00:38:11,482 --> 00:38:13,982
but when accomplishing things

597
00:38:13,983 --> 00:38:16,249
modesty can be put aside.

598
00:38:16,250 --> 00:38:21,149
When facing those that are younger,

599
00:38:21,149 --> 00:38:23,650
- one must remember to be humble--
- Hello!

600
00:38:23,650 --> 00:38:26,116
- Mommy.
- Here son.

601
00:38:26,116 --> 00:38:28,182
- Here.
- Be careful.

602
00:38:28,183 --> 00:38:29,682
The two of you worked hard.

603
00:38:29,683 --> 00:38:31,582
If your eyes are tired or sore later,

604
00:38:31,583 --> 00:38:33,950
just drink some water. Then there's some fruit.

605
00:38:33,950 --> 00:38:36,982
Don't be shy.

606
00:38:36,983 --> 00:38:40,049
How about eating some apples right now?

607
00:38:40,050 --> 00:38:41,215
Here, this.

608
00:38:41,216 --> 00:38:42,516
Come eat some.

609
00:38:42,516 --> 00:38:43,649
Thank you, Auntie.

610
00:38:43,650 --> 00:38:47,182
I really need to thank you. You're really great!

611
00:38:47,182 --> 00:38:48,349
Thank you, Auntie.

612
00:38:48,350 --> 00:38:50,350
Don't be silly, you!

613
00:38:53,783 --> 00:38:55,283
Auntie...

614
00:38:56,883 --> 00:38:58,783
Your job is done here.

615
00:39:04,150 --> 00:39:06,250
Yes, good. Then you guys continue.

616
00:39:06,250 --> 00:39:08,516
Give it your all!

617
00:39:09,783 --> 00:39:11,149
Mom, close the door.

618
00:39:11,150 --> 00:39:13,016
That way I can concentrate better.

619
00:39:14,250 --> 00:39:15,983
Reasonable.

620
00:39:17,316 --> 00:39:19,883
Right. If you don't have anything to do later, stay for dinner.

621
00:39:19,883 --> 00:39:20,816
Auntie, please, there is no need to trouble you.

622
00:39:20,817 --> 00:39:21,915
It's okay.

623
00:39:21,916 --> 00:39:23,315
He will! He will!

624
00:39:23,316 --> 00:39:25,315
Fighting!

625
00:39:25,316 --> 00:39:26,982
Okay. Keep going.

626
00:39:26,982 --> 00:39:27,951
You, concentrate.

627
00:39:27,951 --> 00:39:29,716
- I'll do my best, okay?
- Okay, okay.

628
00:39:29,716 --> 00:39:31,115
Okay, I'll go and prepare.

629
00:39:31,116 --> 00:39:32,549
Okay.

630
00:39:32,550 --> 00:39:33,316
Love you, Mommy.

631
00:39:33,317 --> 00:39:34,916
Okay.

632
00:40:11,150 --> 00:40:15,149
Xiang-xiang, you'll be okay by yourself?

633
00:40:15,149 --> 00:40:17,215
No problem at all.

634
00:40:17,216 --> 00:40:19,850
You go be with your girlfriend.

635
00:40:20,783 --> 00:40:24,551
Okay. Make sure everything is clean. Also...

636
00:40:24,551 --> 00:40:26,549
I know

637
00:40:26,550 --> 00:40:28,182
All the machines have to be put back.

638
00:40:28,183 --> 00:40:30,903
Turn off the lights, close the door, and turn off the air conditioning.

639
00:40:32,716 --> 00:40:34,349
Security system!

640
00:40:34,350 --> 00:40:36,483
Right! I remember.

641
00:40:36,483 --> 00:40:38,450
Relax.

642
00:40:41,483 --> 00:40:43,715
Hello, baby.

643
00:40:43,716 --> 00:40:46,915
Yes, I'm already on my way. I'm almost there!

644
00:40:46,916 --> 00:40:48,683
I'm downstairs now, another five seconds.

645
00:40:48,684 --> 00:40:51,082
Five, four! Three point five.

646
00:40:51,082 --> 00:40:53,083
Such a nag.

647
00:41:01,083 --> 00:41:03,082
Are you being naughty again?

648
00:41:03,083 --> 00:41:04,282
No.

649
00:41:04,283 --> 00:41:05,382
Hurry up and clean up.

650
00:41:05,383 --> 00:41:07,623
I'll take you to grab a bite to eat later.

651
00:41:23,083 --> 00:41:24,683
Why are you here?

652
00:41:26,316 --> 00:41:27,783
For you.

653
00:41:28,916 --> 00:41:32,715
Working until now. You must be tired and hungry.

654
00:41:33,850 --> 00:41:36,250
I'm sweet, aren't I?

655
00:41:38,883 --> 00:41:39,915
Thank you.

656
00:41:39,916 --> 00:41:41,583
You're welcome.

657
00:41:44,283 --> 00:41:46,583
Merry Christmas!

658
00:41:50,116 --> 00:41:51,883
Merry Christmas.

659
00:41:52,883 --> 00:41:54,815
Merry Christmas.

660
00:41:54,816 --> 00:41:57,316
But I didn't prepare anything.

661
00:41:58,316 --> 00:41:59,983
I have you

662
00:42:08,050 --> 00:42:09,916
Yes!

663
00:42:12,883 --> 00:42:13,949
What are you doing?

664
00:42:13,950 --> 00:42:15,550
I'm happy.

665
00:42:16,483 --> 00:42:18,384
Silly.

666
00:42:18,384 --> 00:42:20,782
- Let's go.
- Go.

667
00:42:20,783 --> 00:42:22,350
Wait for me.

668
00:42:23,850 --> 00:42:25,182
What are you doing?

669
00:42:25,183 --> 00:42:26,515
Getting a taxi.

670
00:42:26,516 --> 00:42:28,516
No need. It's too expensive.

671
00:42:28,516 --> 00:42:30,916
How do you usually go home at this hour?

672
00:42:32,083 --> 00:42:34,115
Convenience store.

673
00:42:34,116 --> 00:42:36,782
So I brought my books with me.

674
00:42:36,783 --> 00:42:38,682
You just got off work, why study?

675
00:42:38,683 --> 00:42:41,150
What you need right now is to relax.

676
00:42:42,450 --> 00:42:44,282
Let me take you somewhere.

677
00:42:44,282 --> 00:42:46,416
There are no buses now.

678
00:42:47,650 --> 00:42:49,850
I have a ride.

679
00:42:59,616 --> 00:43:01,050
Get on.

680
00:43:03,416 --> 00:43:05,749
You can go anytime, anywhere.

681
00:43:05,750 --> 00:43:07,249
Convenient, right?

682
00:43:07,250 --> 00:43:09,216
Retard.

683
00:43:10,816 --> 00:43:12,750
Let's go!

684
00:43:14,716 --> 00:43:16,483
Keep up.

685
00:43:17,250 --> 00:43:19,050
Wait for me!

686
00:43:23,316 --> 00:43:25,483
Where are we going?

687
00:43:30,416 --> 00:43:32,349
Can't tell you yet?

688
00:43:32,350 --> 00:43:34,000
Why?

689
00:43:49,550 --> 00:43:51,650
Where the heck are we going?

690
00:44:24,683 --> 00:44:25,616
I'm almost done.

691
00:44:25,616 --> 00:44:26,982
Wait for me to come out and help you.

692
00:44:26,983 --> 00:44:28,550
Okay.

693
00:45:15,760 --> 00:45:21,340
♫ I still don’t understand why you left ♫

694
00:45:21,340 --> 00:45:27,320
♫ I still don’t understand why I’m waiting ♫

695
00:45:27,320 --> 00:45:33,140
♫ Waiting for who will remember their responsibility ♫

696
00:45:33,140 --> 00:45:38,820
♫ I’m left at the original place wandering around alone ♫

697
00:45:38,820 --> 00:45:44,240
♫ When the blue sky and white clouds disappear ♫

698
00:45:44,240 --> 00:45:49,650
♫ When you take away the yellow sneakers and the red sweater ♫

699
00:45:49,650 --> 00:45:55,000
♫ When all the colors are gone along with you ♫

700
00:45:55,000 --> 00:46:01,780
♫ Only transparent tears that unceasingly fall accompany me ♫

701
00:46:01,780 --> 00:46:07,140
♫ I still don’t understand why you left ♫

702
00:46:07,140 --> 00:46:13,160
♫ I still don’t understand why I’m waiting ♫

703
00:46:13,160 --> 00:46:18,970
♫ Waiting for who will remember their responsibility ♫

704
00:46:18,970 --> 00:46:23,350
♫ I’m left at the original place wandering around alone ♫

705
00:46:23,350 --> 00:46:28,700
♫ When one story becomes two regrets ♫

706
00:46:28,700 --> 00:46:34,980
♫ Letting two hearts run towards two different futures ♫

707
00:46:34,980 --> 00:46:40,450
♫ All those that can’t be forgotten can only become regrets ♫

708
00:46:40,450 --> 00:46:48,020
♫ But I still can’t understand why the tears won’t stop ♫
