[Episode 3]

13
00:01:30,133 --> 00:01:32,399
I'm so hungry

14
00:01:32,400 --> 00:01:33,532
I feel like my blood sugar is way too low right now.

15
00:01:33,533 --> 00:01:34,434
I'm going to faint.

16
00:01:34,434 --> 00:01:36,966
Life is so hard.

17
00:01:38,400 --> 00:01:39,100
I'm starving!

18
00:01:39,100 --> 00:01:41,200
- I want to go get something to eat.
- I'm so hungry.

19
00:01:41,266 --> 00:01:42,200
What do you want to eat?

20
00:01:42,201 --> 00:01:44,899
You guys go ahead. Get something for us, too.

21
00:01:44,899 --> 00:01:47,666
- Why don't you come with us?
- Yeah, why not come with?

22
00:01:50,333 --> 00:01:51,965
Old Sun, wait for us.

23
00:01:51,966 --> 00:01:53,700
Let's go, Gao Chun.

24
00:02:05,300 --> 00:02:07,366
You look pretty pitiful.

25
00:02:08,900 --> 00:02:11,633
He doesn't read or reply.

26
00:02:12,166 --> 00:02:13,965
It's like I'm invisible.

27
00:02:13,966 --> 00:02:16,800
Don't you know where he works?

28
00:02:16,800 --> 00:02:19,200
But I'm afraid to face him.

29
00:02:19,200 --> 00:02:21,100
Why?

30
00:02:21,100 --> 00:02:23,665
He probably thinks I'm just a kid right now.

31
00:02:23,666 --> 00:02:25,633
He won't even bother to give me any time.

32
00:02:26,500 --> 00:02:28,466
You are.

33
00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:32,432
Fine.

34
00:02:32,433 --> 00:02:35,899
I was planning to just go and see him.

35
00:02:35,899 --> 00:02:38,299
But for sure he's going to brush me off.

36
00:02:38,300 --> 00:02:40,933
Then we won't even be able to be friends.

37
00:02:43,833 --> 00:02:46,065
Your delivery is here, sir.

38
00:02:46,066 --> 00:02:47,599
That was pretty quick.

39
00:02:47,600 --> 00:02:49,433
Right?

40
00:02:50,466 --> 00:02:52,600
Why is there pizza?

41
00:02:53,966 --> 00:02:56,966
Wait. Didn't I order six chicken leg lunchboxes?

42
00:02:56,966 --> 00:02:58,232
Why are there only four?

43
00:02:58,233 --> 00:03:01,399
I... Don't you know my brother here needs to eat six chicken legs a day

44
00:03:01,399 --> 00:03:03,099
to continue being awesome?

45
00:03:03,100 --> 00:03:05,065
We're currently out of chicken legs.

46
00:03:05,066 --> 00:03:06,200
It's okay!

47
00:03:06,200 --> 00:03:10,166
We've invited our local Zen Ren Oppa Gao Xiao-chun

48
00:03:10,166 --> 00:03:12,533
to help with our one-on-one feeding service.

49
00:03:13,700 --> 00:03:15,433
Feed him.

50
00:03:16,433 --> 00:03:17,465
Excuse me, sir.

51
00:03:17,466 --> 00:03:19,732
We're going to start our feeding procedure.

52
00:03:19,732 --> 00:03:20,833
Yes.

53
00:03:20,833 --> 00:03:23,666
Little poor you, let me help feed you.

54
00:03:25,033 --> 00:03:26,532
You're all a bunch of idiots!

55
00:03:26,533 --> 00:03:28,500
How is it? Do you like our service?

56
00:03:28,500 --> 00:03:29,933
Very good. NT$200, please.

57
00:03:29,933 --> 00:03:31,966
And five stars on top.

58
00:03:35,066 --> 00:03:38,266
Gao Xiao-chun, give him a bad review!

59
00:03:38,266 --> 00:03:41,033
A-hao, where are you going?

60
00:03:41,033 --> 00:03:42,966
What's up with him lately? Always taking off like that.

61
00:03:42,966 --> 00:03:44,700
I don't know.

62
00:04:16,800 --> 00:04:18,280
Xia En!

63
00:04:20,066 --> 00:04:21,233
Where's A-hao?

64
00:04:21,233 --> 00:04:23,466
He hasn't been hanging out with us during lunch lately.

65
00:04:23,466 --> 00:04:25,232
Wasn't he looking for you?

66
00:04:25,233 --> 00:04:27,499
If he's not with you, then where could he be?

67
00:04:27,499 --> 00:04:29,700
How would I know?

68
00:04:30,966 --> 00:04:34,532
Sun Boxiang, for sure, you know where he is.

69
00:04:35,133 --> 00:04:37,365
If you're looking for him, just call him yourself.

70
00:04:37,366 --> 00:04:39,300
Why ask me?

71
00:04:39,300 --> 00:04:41,299
You're useless.

72
00:04:41,300 --> 00:04:43,300
We're useless.

73
00:04:53,133 --> 00:04:54,133
Hello.

74
00:04:54,134 --> 00:04:55,265
Where are you?

75
00:04:55,266 --> 00:04:56,133
School.

76
00:04:56,134 --> 00:04:57,832
Of course, I know you're at school.

77
00:04:57,832 --> 00:04:59,633
I'm busy. What is it?

78
00:04:59,633 --> 00:05:02,266
You forgot that we're going out for lunch.

79
00:05:02,833 --> 00:05:03,900
I'm not hungry now.

80
00:05:03,901 --> 00:05:06,299
It's not about being hungry, it's that we...

81
00:05:06,301 --> 00:05:09,199
Okay, I'm busy now. Bye-bye.

82
00:05:16,100 --> 00:05:18,100
Xiang Haoting hung up on me!

83
00:05:18,100 --> 00:05:19,400
He probably has something urgent to do.

84
00:05:19,400 --> 00:05:21,000
Really?

85
00:05:23,500 --> 00:05:25,900
He's going to the bathroom.

86
00:05:29,966 --> 00:05:33,166
And also he's wiping himself, so he doesn't have time to talk.

87
00:05:33,166 --> 00:05:35,900
- That must be it!
- Must be it.

88
00:05:35,900 --> 00:05:39,033
What kind of leader breeds the same kind of monkeys?

89
00:05:40,600 --> 00:05:42,333
Monkeys.

90
00:06:08,200 --> 00:06:10,466
You don't need to eat?

91
00:06:10,466 --> 00:06:13,299
Lunch is already half over and he's still sleeping.

92
00:06:28,233 --> 00:06:29,900
Xiang Haoting!

93
00:07:49,333 --> 00:07:51,066
What do you want?

94
00:07:52,300 --> 00:07:53,666
I...

95
00:07:54,566 --> 00:07:55,800
Nothing.

96
00:08:52,800 --> 00:08:54,966
- Idiot!
- Ring the bell.

97
00:08:54,966 --> 00:08:56,100
- Get him!
- Try to get me.

98
00:08:56,100 --> 00:08:59,933
- Get over here!
- Come here!

99
00:08:59,933 --> 00:09:01,733
Idiot.

100
00:09:18,400 --> 00:09:20,366
We'll buy you something to drink.

101
00:09:30,933 --> 00:09:32,600
What's up?

102
00:09:32,600 --> 00:09:34,400
Why did you hang up on me?

103
00:09:34,400 --> 00:09:36,430
I couldn't find you at all during lunch.

104
00:09:37,300 --> 00:09:38,600
I was busy.

105
00:09:38,600 --> 00:09:40,366
Busy doing what?

106
00:09:40,366 --> 00:09:43,633
Didn't we agree we would discuss our winter vacation?

107
00:09:43,633 --> 00:09:45,933
Didn't we say for you to plan and decide?

108
00:09:45,933 --> 00:09:46,965
I'm okay with everything.

109
00:09:46,966 --> 00:09:49,233
Why should I decide on everything?

110
00:09:50,033 --> 00:09:53,265
Feels like I'm the only one that wants to go; you don't want to go.

111
00:09:58,400 --> 00:10:00,300
Is it because I said that I like Yu Shigu before,

112
00:10:00,300 --> 00:10:03,000
so you're ignoring me?

113
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:06,700
I already said I'm sorry to you.

114
00:10:09,880 --> 00:10:12,860
Haven't we reconciled?

115
00:10:18,700 --> 00:10:20,099
I'm not ignoring you.

116
00:10:20,100 --> 00:10:21,666
Stop thinking like that

117
00:10:25,333 --> 00:10:27,266
You want to discuss it together.

118
00:10:31,733 --> 00:10:34,100
Give me a smile.

119
00:10:41,500 --> 00:10:42,366
De, I'm taking off first.

120
00:10:42,367 --> 00:10:44,066
- Bye-bye.
- Bye.

121
00:10:47,866 --> 00:10:50,066
What can I do to make peace?

122
00:10:52,933 --> 00:10:54,866
Exams are very important to me.

123
00:10:54,866 --> 00:10:57,999
If you guys want me to apologize, I'll do it.

124
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:00,300
I don't understand what you're saying.

125
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:05,265
Go ask Xiang Haoting.

126
00:11:05,266 --> 00:11:07,300
Then, let me know his response.

127
00:11:10,366 --> 00:11:13,133
You're enjoying it too much. Give it here; let me have a bite.

128
00:11:16,200 --> 00:11:17,866
If you want some, order some yourself.

129
00:11:19,533 --> 00:11:24,233
- Take your hands off that piece of cake.
- Take your hands off that piece of cake.

130
00:11:31,200 --> 00:11:33,600
Yu Shigu said that exams are really important to him.

131
00:11:33,600 --> 00:11:36,600
However you guys want him to apologize, he'll do it.

132
00:11:37,533 --> 00:11:41,001
- So you're still harassing Yu Shigu?
- No.

133
00:11:41,001 --> 00:11:43,333
Then, why did he ask my little brother to relay his message?

134
00:11:44,700 --> 00:11:45,866
He misunderstood.

135
00:11:45,866 --> 00:11:48,300
What did you do to make him misunderstand?

136
00:11:49,866 --> 00:11:52,333
Nothing. Just...

137
00:11:52,333 --> 00:11:54,733
I just followed him.

138
00:11:55,433 --> 00:11:58,865
Just following? Or stalking?

139
00:11:58,865 --> 00:11:59,900
What do you mean?

140
00:11:59,901 --> 00:12:01,465
Is there a difference?

141
00:12:01,466 --> 00:12:03,100
Of course, there is.

142
00:12:03,100 --> 00:12:05,766
Following is open and public.

143
00:12:05,766 --> 00:12:11,132
Stalking is sneaky and secret.

144
00:12:11,132 --> 00:12:12,766
I understand.

145
00:12:14,033 --> 00:12:15,565
Stalking then.

146
00:12:15,566 --> 00:12:17,166
What?

147
00:12:18,566 --> 00:12:20,601
- Stalking.
- What?

148
00:12:20,601 --> 00:12:23,165
Stalking!

149
00:12:23,166 --> 00:12:24,265
No way!

150
00:12:24,266 --> 00:12:25,599
What's the matter with you?

151
00:12:25,600 --> 00:12:26,632
What are you doing?

152
00:12:26,633 --> 00:12:29,700
He's probably regretting and wants to apologize to him.

153
00:12:29,700 --> 00:12:32,466
Don't do it. Don't any of you forget.

154
00:12:32,466 --> 00:12:35,833
Because of him, we had to sweep for half a day.

155
00:12:35,833 --> 00:12:38,365
It was a week.

156
00:12:38,366 --> 00:12:40,199
One week.

157
00:12:40,200 --> 00:12:42,799
Why care so much? It was just one subject that he missed.

158
00:12:42,799 --> 00:12:46,932
This way, we're even and we'll have nothing to do with him.

159
00:12:46,932 --> 00:12:48,832
But it seems he's still really worried.

160
00:12:48,833 --> 00:12:50,599
And scared that you're going to cause more trouble.

161
00:12:50,600 --> 00:12:52,866
Just go and talk to him and clear everything up.

162
00:12:52,866 --> 00:12:55,565
We're all even now. Then all's fine.

163
00:12:55,565 --> 00:12:57,232
Why does A-hao need to go tell him?

164
00:12:57,233 --> 00:13:00,000
You should just go and tell him. Aren't you in the same class?

165
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:02,866
If A-hao goes, it's more convincing for him.

166
00:13:02,866 --> 00:13:05,099
Give me a break, it's not that serious.

167
00:13:05,100 --> 00:13:06,599
He can believe it or not, it's up to him.

168
00:13:06,600 --> 00:13:08,210
Wait.

169
00:13:09,100 --> 00:13:11,566
I think you should go in person and tell him.

170
00:13:12,333 --> 00:13:14,866
This way, you'll feel better, too. Right?

171
00:13:21,700 --> 00:13:22,999
Boss, I want a butter one.

172
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:24,232
One butter.

173
00:13:24,233 --> 00:13:26,800
I only have NT$40.

174
00:13:27,566 --> 00:13:29,732
I can only eat four.

175
00:13:29,733 --> 00:13:31,532
Sun Bo, let me ask you something.

176
00:13:31,533 --> 00:13:33,599
Do you think I'm good looking?

177
00:13:33,600 --> 00:13:35,133
Handsome.

178
00:13:36,233 --> 00:13:39,565
I'm serious. Am I good looking?

179
00:13:39,565 --> 00:13:42,167
Very good looking. If not, why would Li Shiyu like you? Right?

180
00:13:42,167 --> 00:13:46,665
And you... When you look at me, do you get any feeling?

181
00:13:48,033 --> 00:13:49,865
Like your heart is going to jump out of your chest?

182
00:13:49,866 --> 00:13:53,266
Nope. Sounds like, boom-tsss, boom-tsss!
(beatbox sounds)

183
00:13:53,266 --> 00:13:56,000
That kind of feeling.

184
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:58,666
Boss, I want four red beans.

185
00:13:58,666 --> 00:14:00,133
Four red beans. Okay.

186
00:14:00,133 --> 00:14:01,467
- I want--
- Wait!

187
00:14:01,467 --> 00:14:03,565
Change that to two red beans and two butter.

188
00:14:03,566 --> 00:14:06,100
- Two red beans, two butter.
- Are you finished?

189
00:14:06,100 --> 00:14:07,399
Boss, four butter. Thanks.

190
00:14:07,400 --> 00:14:08,800
Four butter, okay.

191
00:14:08,800 --> 00:14:10,332
Make that two radishes.

192
00:14:10,333 --> 00:14:11,399
Two radishes.

193
00:14:11,400 --> 00:14:13,100
Wait, all butter. Thanks.

194
00:14:13,100 --> 00:14:15,166
Wow, you're so fast.

195
00:14:16,833 --> 00:14:18,866
Are you guys done?

196
00:14:21,133 --> 00:14:22,700
Thank you, Boss.

197
00:14:24,700 --> 00:14:26,399
Hurry up.

198
00:14:26,400 --> 00:14:28,266
When you see me, do you get nervous?

199
00:14:28,266 --> 00:14:30,366
Wait. When I see you, why should I be nervous?

200
00:14:30,366 --> 00:14:32,300
But I do.

201
00:14:32,300 --> 00:14:35,433
Every time I think about his protruding cheekbones...

202
00:14:35,433 --> 00:14:36,900
Here you go.

203
00:14:38,333 --> 00:14:40,300
- Thank you, boss.
- Thank you.

204
00:14:40,300 --> 00:14:42,033
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

205
00:14:44,133 --> 00:14:47,199
- Also, his long eyelashes...
- Who?

206
00:14:47,199 --> 00:14:49,866
Tender lips, I just want to...

207
00:14:50,433 --> 00:14:54,833
So juicy.

208
00:14:54,833 --> 00:14:56,733
Are you too in love with yourself?

209
00:14:57,300 --> 00:14:59,633
I'm not talking about me!

210
00:15:00,600 --> 00:15:02,400
Then, who are you talking about?

211
00:15:03,166 --> 00:15:05,066
Wait! Who are you talking about?

212
00:15:08,630 --> 00:15:12,733
- Yu Shigu.
- Yu Shigu?

213
00:15:13,666 --> 00:15:17,065
"Don't hassle me about it." That Yu Shigu?

214
00:15:21,166 --> 00:15:23,065
I really think he's good looking.

215
00:15:23,066 --> 00:15:26,833
And whenever I see him, I don't know why but my heart feels like...

216
00:15:26,833 --> 00:15:29,266
It's about to jump out of my body.

217
00:15:32,566 --> 00:15:34,165
Don't joke around with me!

218
00:15:34,166 --> 00:15:36,432
I'm not.

219
00:15:36,433 --> 00:15:38,865
At first, it was because...

220
00:15:38,866 --> 00:15:40,966
...he cried. Then when I saw him, I felt sorry for him.

221
00:15:40,966 --> 00:15:45,499
So I thought it was because I pitied him,

222
00:15:45,500 --> 00:15:47,533
but it's not like that at all.

223
00:15:50,633 --> 00:15:54,765
I realized that I'm starting to pay more attention to him.

224
00:15:54,766 --> 00:15:58,299
Like when he's studying, when he's laughing,

225
00:15:58,300 --> 00:16:00,265
when he's walking,

226
00:16:00,265 --> 00:16:03,980
even when he's standing still in one spot.

227
00:16:04,566 --> 00:16:07,733
I can't help myself but to look at him.

228
00:16:07,733 --> 00:16:10,340
Just like today in the health clinic.

229
00:16:10,833 --> 00:16:14,700
I just kept on, kept on, staring at him.

230
00:16:14,700 --> 00:16:16,466
I don't know what the heck is going on with me.

231
00:16:16,466 --> 00:16:18,200
I just think that...

232
00:16:20,417 --> 00:16:22,400
he's really cute.

233
00:16:24,500 --> 00:16:26,865
He's really cute.

234
00:16:26,866 --> 00:16:29,065
You like Yu Shigu.

235
00:16:29,066 --> 00:16:30,466
Me?

236
00:16:31,466 --> 00:16:32,632
But he's a guy.

237
00:16:32,633 --> 00:16:34,420
Sun Bo! Sun Bo!

238
00:16:35,200 --> 00:16:37,466
You like guys. You tell me.

239
00:16:37,466 --> 00:16:39,866
What's the difference between liking girls and liking guys?

240
00:16:45,933 --> 00:16:47,665
Guys and girls are both humans

241
00:16:47,666 --> 00:16:50,400
The feeling of liking them should be the same.

242
00:16:50,400 --> 00:16:53,733
So I like Yu Shigu.

243
00:16:56,433 --> 00:16:59,332
Why would you ask me? You should ask yourself that.

244
00:16:59,332 --> 00:17:01,813
Of course, I'm going to ask you. Who else am I going to ask? I just don't know, that's why I'm asking you!

245
00:17:01,813 --> 00:17:02,733
I don't know either!

246
00:17:02,734 --> 00:17:04,733
Then, how were you sure you liked Li Shiyu?

247
00:17:04,733 --> 00:17:09,165
With Li Shiyu, I kissed her and touched her. Then my little mushroom just...

248
00:17:12,400 --> 00:17:14,766
You're a beast.

249
00:17:16,300 --> 00:17:17,933
I know.

250
00:17:21,700 --> 00:17:23,599
Don't.

251
00:17:23,600 --> 00:17:26,033
What? Xiang Haoting!

252
00:17:30,714 --> 00:17:33,387
Didn't the weather forecast call for rain these days?

253
00:17:33,412 --> 00:17:35,133
Where's your umbrella?

254
00:17:35,133 --> 00:17:37,233
Didn't bring it again.

255
00:17:37,233 --> 00:17:39,566
Thanks.

256
00:17:39,566 --> 00:17:41,766
Love you.

257
00:17:41,766 --> 00:17:42,800
Okay, okay.

258
00:17:42,800 --> 00:17:44,932
If my mom and dad ask you,

259
00:17:44,933 --> 00:17:46,233
you guys need to cover for me.

260
00:17:46,233 --> 00:17:47,633
Is this really okay?

261
00:17:47,633 --> 00:17:50,033
No problem.

262
00:17:50,033 --> 00:17:53,280
You're really going to go to the hot spring with Mr. Xiang?

263
00:17:53,933 --> 00:17:56,600
Overnight, too?

264
00:17:56,600 --> 00:17:58,900
He picked the room, I paid for the train tickets.

265
00:17:58,900 --> 00:18:01,166
Isn't that Yu Baby?

266
00:18:03,066 --> 00:18:05,200
What's he doing?

267
00:18:06,733 --> 00:18:09,566
This place is a club, isn't it?

268
00:18:10,166 --> 00:18:12,266
What's he doing going into a club?

269
00:18:12,266 --> 00:18:14,466
What else do you do at a club?

270
00:18:14,466 --> 00:18:16,466
A model student in appearance.

271
00:18:16,466 --> 00:18:18,533
Underneath, he's a player.

272
00:18:18,533 --> 00:18:21,266
No way! Yu Baby is good and a very quiet guy.

273
00:18:21,266 --> 00:18:23,400
No way he's a party goer.

274
00:18:24,166 --> 00:18:26,666
A lot of people look one way but are totally opposite.

275
00:18:26,666 --> 00:18:29,632
Who knows what he's really like?

276
00:18:29,633 --> 00:18:32,366
This nightclub is kind of unique, too.

277
00:18:32,366 --> 00:18:35,766
It's a place that only guys go to.

278
00:18:35,766 --> 00:18:37,420
My god!

279
00:18:38,366 --> 00:18:40,532
A lot of guys!

280
00:18:40,533 --> 00:18:42,932
What are you doing?

281
00:18:42,933 --> 00:18:45,400
Yu baby!

282
00:18:46,533 --> 00:18:49,133
What the heck is going on with you?

283
00:18:50,166 --> 00:18:53,333
Working part-time here is NT$2000 each time.

284
00:18:53,333 --> 00:18:55,899
As long as I avoid affecting school,

285
00:18:55,900 --> 00:18:57,466
just another ten times...

286
00:18:57,466 --> 00:19:00,033
Ten times and I'll be fine.

287
00:19:10,166 --> 00:19:11,900
What do you want?

288
00:19:19,800 --> 00:19:22,733
I'm not going to bother you anymore.

289
00:19:22,733 --> 00:19:24,330
Really.

290
00:19:25,233 --> 00:19:27,533
Believe me!

291
00:19:27,533 --> 00:19:29,766
Then, why do you keep following me?

292
00:19:32,933 --> 00:19:35,732
I need you to help me confirm something.

293
00:19:35,733 --> 00:19:37,733
I don't want to. What do you need to confirm?

294
00:19:37,733 --> 00:19:40,900
When I'm certain, I will tell you for sure.

295
00:19:45,200 --> 00:19:47,066
I keep thinking about you.

296
00:19:49,800 --> 00:19:50,901
I don't know why.

297
00:19:50,901 --> 00:19:52,300
I...

298
00:19:53,166 --> 00:19:56,299
Walking, eating, showering,

299
00:19:56,300 --> 00:19:59,466
playing video games, even when I'm sleeping, I see you.

300
00:20:01,533 --> 00:20:03,566
What do you want?

301
00:20:31,433 --> 00:20:33,100
It's getting faster.

302
00:20:41,300 --> 00:20:45,000
It's real. I like you!

303
00:20:49,133 --> 00:20:50,766
What are you doing?

304
00:21:08,766 --> 00:21:10,832
What?

305
00:21:10,833 --> 00:21:12,500
This...

306
00:21:18,800 --> 00:21:22,299
Does anyone know what abolishing the feudal system is?

307
00:21:22,300 --> 00:21:23,966
Yu Shigu!

308
00:21:26,566 --> 00:21:31,433
Yu Shigu. Yu. Shigu!

309
00:21:38,133 --> 00:21:39,966
What is it?

310
00:21:42,766 --> 00:21:44,565
I don't know.

311
00:21:44,566 --> 00:21:45,633
How's that possible?

312
00:21:45,633 --> 00:21:48,165
Quiet.

313
00:21:48,166 --> 00:21:51,266
Abolishing the feudal system, you really don't know?

314
00:21:53,700 --> 00:21:57,665
Canceling the feudal privileges and obligations of the people.

315
00:21:57,666 --> 00:21:59,065
What about human rights and citizenship?

316
00:21:59,066 --> 00:22:01,900
Naturalizing human rights and sovereignty of it.

317
00:22:01,900 --> 00:22:03,499
Have a seat.

318
00:22:03,500 --> 00:22:04,980
Yes.

319
00:22:05,633 --> 00:22:07,333
Concentrate.

320
00:22:08,333 --> 00:22:10,699
Everyone else, look at your textbooks.

321
00:22:10,700 --> 00:22:12,299
Point number three, economic reform.

322
00:22:12,300 --> 00:22:14,471
Last time, we said this was very important.

323
00:22:14,471 --> 00:22:17,399
Abolishing guilds and the privileges of the rich.

324
00:22:17,400 --> 00:22:20,933
Encouraging free trade is to encourage the general public to interact through free trade.

325
00:22:20,933 --> 00:22:23,400
This will be on the exam for sure. You hear that?

326
00:22:23,400 --> 00:22:25,966
Memorize all of this. I don't want to say it again a second time.

327
00:23:12,766 --> 00:23:14,232
I reserved a bed for you.

328
00:23:14,233 --> 00:23:15,900
You can have both of them.

329
00:23:20,966 --> 00:23:22,999
You still have to eat before going to sleep.

330
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:25,466
Come over here. Let's eat together.

331
00:23:27,433 --> 00:23:28,499
I really don't understand.

332
00:23:28,500 --> 00:23:32,365
Look at you, you're so skinny. Why are you still dieting?

333
00:23:34,800 --> 00:23:36,065
You don't need to worry.

334
00:23:36,066 --> 00:23:38,566
My method of chasing after girls has always been--

335
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:41,900
Girlfriend?

336
00:23:45,200 --> 00:23:48,700
Boy...

337
00:23:48,700 --> 00:23:49,733
Never mind!

338
00:23:49,734 --> 00:23:51,700
Anyway, I'll make sure you feel--

339
00:23:51,700 --> 00:23:54,033
Stop talking nonsense!

340
00:23:54,033 --> 00:23:56,000
What do you really want?

341
00:23:57,900 --> 00:24:00,730
Didn't I say it clearly enough yesterday.

342
00:24:01,300 --> 00:24:03,300
I want to go out with you.

343
00:24:03,766 --> 00:24:05,800
Stop joking around with me!

344
00:24:08,833 --> 00:24:11,366
I really do want to go out with you.

345
00:24:11,366 --> 00:24:13,565
Are you a guy or not?

346
00:24:13,566 --> 00:24:14,999
I already apologized.

347
00:24:15,000 --> 00:24:16,965
Can't you just simply leave it at that?

348
00:24:16,966 --> 00:24:18,866
I am very simple.

349
00:24:28,766 --> 00:24:31,300
I just want to go out with you.

350
00:24:56,100 --> 00:24:58,100
Why don't you eat?

351
00:24:59,100 --> 00:25:01,133
If you don't eat it, I'll eat it for you.

352
00:25:08,266 --> 00:25:11,632
Sun Bo, what's going on with you lately?

353
00:25:11,632 --> 00:25:13,610
Why are you depressed all the time?

354
00:25:14,466 --> 00:25:16,099
Whatever trouble it is, just tell us!

355
00:25:16,100 --> 00:25:17,900
We'll all help you find a solution.

356
00:25:17,900 --> 00:25:19,332
That's right. If you have a problem, just say it.

357
00:25:19,333 --> 00:25:21,032
We'll help you solve it.

358
00:25:21,033 --> 00:25:22,433
Especially with exams coming up.

359
00:25:22,433 --> 00:25:24,634
Your emotions might affect your marks. What then?

360
00:25:24,634 --> 00:25:26,166
I've really had it with you!

361
00:25:26,166 --> 00:25:28,266
We're looking out for our brother,

362
00:25:28,266 --> 00:25:29,800
and you bring up exams!

363
00:25:29,800 --> 00:25:33,233
Seriously. Can't you just forget about exams for the moment?

364
00:25:33,233 --> 00:25:36,199
Give us back a peaceful and quiet lunch break, okay?

365
00:25:36,200 --> 00:25:37,166
I'm serious.

366
00:25:37,166 --> 00:25:39,466
We're serious, too.

367
00:25:40,166 --> 00:25:41,600
Sun Bo.

368
00:25:43,566 --> 00:25:45,200
What?

369
00:25:46,666 --> 00:25:48,665
What is it?

370
00:25:48,666 --> 00:25:49,999
What should I do?

371
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:51,265
What do you mean what should you do?

372
00:25:51,266 --> 00:25:52,799
Just...

373
00:25:52,800 --> 00:25:54,599
It's just that he!

374
00:25:54,600 --> 00:25:56,765
How do I get him to believe me more?

375
00:25:56,766 --> 00:25:57,932
Pay more attention to me?

376
00:25:57,933 --> 00:25:59,765
I don't know what to do.

377
00:25:59,766 --> 00:26:01,700
Stop saying these things here, okay?

378
00:26:01,700 --> 00:26:03,900
If I don't say it here, where am I going to say it? Tell me.

379
00:26:03,900 --> 00:26:05,100
I don't know.

380
00:26:05,100 --> 00:26:07,490
- How can you not know?
- What is it?

381
00:26:07,490 --> 00:26:09,158
Don't you really like that older uncle?

382
00:26:09,158 --> 00:26:10,599
Aren't you head over heels in love with him?

383
00:26:10,600 --> 00:26:13,300
- Okay!
- Tell me how to chase after him!

384
00:26:16,866 --> 00:26:19,666
You really are an idiot!

385
00:26:21,966 --> 00:26:24,300
Retard. I tell you all the time but you never listen.

386
00:26:25,833 --> 00:26:27,233
I--

387
00:26:32,966 --> 00:26:34,799
Forget everything!

388
00:26:34,800 --> 00:26:38,232
Sun Bo, I'm sorry!

389
00:26:38,833 --> 00:26:40,500
Did you hear?

390
00:26:49,633 --> 00:26:53,100
You're such a pain. You do the same thing every time.

391
00:26:55,233 --> 00:26:56,565
How many times have I told you?

392
00:26:56,566 --> 00:26:58,799
Sorry.

393
00:26:58,800 --> 00:27:01,066
Always do whatever you want.

394
00:27:01,066 --> 00:27:04,366
Sorry. I know I was wrong.

395
00:27:13,166 --> 00:27:15,099
I really can't help it!

396
00:27:15,100 --> 00:27:17,599
What do you mean, you can't help it?

397
00:27:17,600 --> 00:27:19,565
He's scared of me.

398
00:27:19,566 --> 00:27:21,665
What?

399
00:27:21,666 --> 00:27:24,132
I'm not sure if scared is the right word.

400
00:27:24,133 --> 00:27:28,734
But every time he sees me, he becomes really timid and very defensive.

401
00:27:28,734 --> 00:27:31,665
Like I'm going to eat him alive.

402
00:27:31,700 --> 00:27:33,399
Am I that scary?

403
00:27:33,400 --> 00:27:35,100
Of course.

404
00:27:38,100 --> 00:27:41,032
How did you get along with your older uncle?

405
00:27:41,033 --> 00:27:44,740
- Big brother.
- Big brother.

406
00:27:45,466 --> 00:27:48,080
How did you connect with him?

407
00:27:48,633 --> 00:27:50,365
Actually, it's the same.

408
00:27:50,366 --> 00:27:51,233
How's it the same?

409
00:27:51,234 --> 00:27:56,766
Let me tell you. The most important thing about being in love is being sincere.

410
00:27:56,766 --> 00:28:00,466
Keep moving forward, no matter the consequences!

411
00:28:00,466 --> 00:28:03,665
All or nothing determination!

412
00:28:03,666 --> 00:28:05,499
Otherwise, if you don't impress him,

413
00:28:05,500 --> 00:28:09,232
then why in the world would he bother liking you?

414
00:28:09,766 --> 00:28:12,200
You're being too naive.

415
00:28:13,300 --> 00:28:15,233
True.

416
00:28:16,130 --> 00:28:18,630
How come I've never thought about it like that?

417
00:28:21,966 --> 00:28:25,400
Sun Bo, what you're saying is right.

418
00:28:25,400 --> 00:28:27,366
We must let them believe.

419
00:28:27,366 --> 00:28:29,332
Even if there is no hope left,

420
00:28:29,333 --> 00:28:30,999
we have to keep trying.

421
00:28:31,000 --> 00:28:33,165
To let them know that we truly love them.

422
00:28:33,166 --> 00:28:34,766
Good luck to both of us!

423
00:28:38,633 --> 00:28:40,533
The classroom's that way.

424
00:28:51,266 --> 00:28:53,300
Please give this back to Xiang Haoting.

425
00:28:54,366 --> 00:28:56,600
Why do you have his lunchbox?

426
00:28:58,133 --> 00:29:00,100
Just return it to him.

427
00:29:00,100 --> 00:29:02,366
I didn't touch the lunchboxes.

428
00:29:02,933 --> 00:29:05,533
Thank you.

429
00:29:17,866 --> 00:29:20,265
Gao Xiao-chun, hurry up.

430
00:29:20,266 --> 00:29:22,366
How can I hurry up if you don't help?

431
00:29:22,366 --> 00:29:23,400
I'm helping.

432
00:29:23,401 --> 00:29:25,100
You call that helping?

433
00:29:25,100 --> 00:29:27,600
Hurry up, stop nagging!

434
00:29:46,233 --> 00:29:48,080
What's up with Old Sun?

435
00:29:48,700 --> 00:29:50,600
He's probably depressed.

436
00:29:54,700 --> 00:29:57,700
A-hao, the thing you said during lunch,

437
00:29:57,700 --> 00:30:00,500
was it real or not?

438
00:30:00,500 --> 00:30:02,233
What thing?

439
00:30:05,033 --> 00:30:09,466
When you asked him how to chase after a boyfriend.

440
00:30:11,566 --> 00:30:16,532
So Old Sun really likes a guy?

441
00:30:18,066 --> 00:30:19,766
Come here.

442
00:30:21,300 --> 00:30:23,033
What?

443
00:30:23,033 --> 00:30:25,833
He's not a brother because he likes guys.

444
00:30:25,833 --> 00:30:28,265
What kind of thinking is that, you guys?

445
00:30:28,266 --> 00:30:29,965
That's not what we mean.

446
00:30:29,966 --> 00:30:31,465
We're just trying to look out for him.

447
00:30:31,466 --> 00:30:34,100
If you really care and want to understand, then ask him yourself.

448
00:30:34,100 --> 00:30:37,165
Fine, so even if it is true.

449
00:30:37,166 --> 00:30:39,433
What difference does it make?

450
00:30:47,666 --> 00:30:49,832
What's with the faces?

451
00:30:49,833 --> 00:30:51,866
No way.

452
00:30:51,866 --> 00:30:53,499
You're thinking too much.

453
00:30:53,500 --> 00:30:57,599
Even if it's true, he wouldn't even bother looking at the two of you.

454
00:31:00,700 --> 00:31:03,666
At least it would be someone on my level.

455
00:31:04,766 --> 00:31:06,966
- We're trying to be serious with him.
- Don't know what he's talking about.

456
00:31:06,966 --> 00:31:08,632
What?

457
00:31:08,633 --> 00:31:10,799
Hard to talk to.

458
00:31:10,800 --> 00:31:12,465
_______

459
00:31:12,466 --> 00:31:13,932
A-hao!

460
00:31:13,933 --> 00:31:15,633
De!

461
00:31:25,000 --> 00:31:26,332
Two.

462
00:31:26,333 --> 00:31:27,933
Good, not bad. C'mon, chest up, chest up.

463
00:31:27,933 --> 00:31:30,732
Three. Focus.

464
00:31:30,732 --> 00:31:31,732
Four.

465
00:31:31,733 --> 00:31:32,965
Okay, let's go.

466
00:31:32,966 --> 00:31:34,932
Go.

467
00:31:34,933 --> 00:31:36,165
Okay, let me take a look over here.

468
00:31:36,166 --> 00:31:37,732
Everything good?

469
00:31:37,733 --> 00:31:39,533
What are you working on today?

470
00:31:41,433 --> 00:31:44,533
Xiao-gang, are you okay?

471
00:31:44,533 --> 00:31:45,899
I'm fine.

472
00:31:45,900 --> 00:31:48,232
Who called you?

473
00:31:48,233 --> 00:31:50,399
No one.

474
00:31:50,400 --> 00:31:52,070
You okay?

475
00:31:52,766 --> 00:31:54,865
Don't pinch.

476
00:31:54,866 --> 00:31:57,265
What's going on with you today?

477
00:31:57,266 --> 00:31:59,299
The whole day, your mind seems to be somewhere else.

478
00:31:59,300 --> 00:32:01,366
What is it?

479
00:32:01,366 --> 00:32:03,500
Just stuff at the office.

480
00:32:03,500 --> 00:32:07,433
You! Next time, you can't be like this, got it?

481
00:32:07,433 --> 00:32:09,765
Okay, I know.

482
00:32:09,766 --> 00:32:11,733
Are you hurt?

483
00:32:20,300 --> 00:32:21,766
[Your Brother Chigang got hurt today]

484
00:32:31,100 --> 00:32:32,333
Hello?

485
00:32:32,333 --> 00:32:34,499
Hello. What happened?

486
00:32:34,500 --> 00:32:36,065
Didn't you see the picture?

487
00:32:36,066 --> 00:32:38,599
How could you let him get hurt?

488
00:32:38,600 --> 00:32:40,432
It had nothing to do with me.

489
00:32:40,433 --> 00:32:42,432
You really are useless.

490
00:32:42,433 --> 00:32:46,032
I already helped him ice it down, okay?

491
00:32:46,033 --> 00:32:47,232
Is he okay?

492
00:32:47,233 --> 00:32:49,799
It's fine.

493
00:32:49,800 --> 00:32:52,233
You need to substitute for me this weekend. Don't forget!

494
00:32:52,233 --> 00:32:54,332
Don't skip out on me!

495
00:32:54,333 --> 00:32:55,933
Fine.

496
00:33:04,566 --> 00:33:06,332
The change that we give customers,

497
00:33:06,333 --> 00:33:07,732
we leave here.

498
00:33:07,733 --> 00:33:09,700
We count this in our daily count.

499
00:33:09,700 --> 00:33:11,733
Then this chart below here is

500
00:33:11,733 --> 00:33:13,499
something that you need to get familiar with, too.

501
00:33:13,500 --> 00:33:15,232
Because no matter if we bring in inventory or sell off stock,

502
00:33:15,233 --> 00:33:17,099
we need to record every transaction here.

503
00:33:17,100 --> 00:33:19,799
Also, office supplies are over here.

504
00:33:19,800 --> 00:33:21,833
Good afternoon, how are you?

505
00:33:23,633 --> 00:33:26,300
Brother Chigang, I heard you got hurt.

506
00:33:26,300 --> 00:33:28,199
Are you okay?

507
00:33:28,200 --> 00:33:29,399
I'm fine.

508
00:33:29,400 --> 00:33:31,433
Do you want something to drink?

509
00:33:34,700 --> 00:33:36,500
Do you have time now?

510
00:33:37,900 --> 00:33:39,900
I want to chat with you.

511
00:33:53,733 --> 00:33:57,233
So you came today to talk to me about kissing me last time.

512
00:33:57,966 --> 00:33:59,399
It's fine.

513
00:33:59,400 --> 00:34:02,532
I've let it go. You don't need to worry about it either.

514
00:34:12,033 --> 00:34:13,940
I like you.

515
00:34:15,633 --> 00:34:18,060
I'm not just going through a phase.

516
00:34:18,966 --> 00:34:21,432
Ever since I started going to my cousin's gym,
(T/N: they call their cousin 'brother'.

517
00:34:21,433 --> 00:34:23,966
I started liking you

518
00:34:23,966 --> 00:34:26,200
The first time I saw you.

519
00:34:27,166 --> 00:34:30,633
I've liked you for 473 days now.

520
00:34:32,900 --> 00:34:35,570
Then after getting to know you better,

521
00:34:36,433 --> 00:34:38,633
I'm even more sure now that I like you.

522
00:34:39,866 --> 00:34:42,899
The other day, I saw you get into another guys car,

523
00:34:42,900 --> 00:34:44,866
and the two of you were pretty intimate.

524
00:34:47,633 --> 00:34:49,940
If you can be open to guys,

525
00:34:51,033 --> 00:34:53,366
then give me a chance.

526
00:34:54,600 --> 00:34:57,100
I really do want to be with you.

527
00:34:59,533 --> 00:35:01,366
I believe you like me.

528
00:35:01,366 --> 00:35:03,965
But what about the future?

529
00:35:03,966 --> 00:35:05,540
I will.

530
00:35:07,333 --> 00:35:09,166
Do you like me?

531
00:35:10,900 --> 00:35:12,365
Who doesn't?

532
00:35:12,366 --> 00:35:15,532
You're so cute and good looking, and have a good personality.

533
00:35:15,532 --> 00:35:17,566
Of course, I like you.

534
00:35:18,766 --> 00:35:21,466
I'm talking about like as in being together, like.

535
00:35:28,966 --> 00:35:30,900
I'm very serious.

536
00:35:31,500 --> 00:35:33,766
I want to be with you forever.

537
00:35:33,766 --> 00:35:35,360
Forever?

538
00:35:37,533 --> 00:35:38,999
You're too young.

539
00:35:39,000 --> 00:35:42,266
You're in high school, what do you know about forever?

540
00:35:42,266 --> 00:35:43,965
I know.

541
00:35:43,966 --> 00:35:47,099
Can you guarantee that you'll like guys forever?

542
00:35:47,100 --> 00:35:47,942
I can.

543
00:35:47,942 --> 00:35:50,391
Maybe you'll wake up suddenly and start to like the girl teacher in class

544
00:35:50,391 --> 00:35:52,599
or the guy in the next class.

545
00:35:52,600 --> 00:35:54,199
I definitely won't.

546
00:35:54,200 --> 00:35:56,365
I was the same when I was your age.

547
00:35:56,366 --> 00:35:58,899
Don't use age as a leverage against me!

548
00:35:58,900 --> 00:36:01,400
What does age have to do with liking someone?

549
00:36:01,978 --> 00:36:03,865
Of course, it does.

550
00:36:03,865 --> 00:36:06,666
It's just that you still can't understand yet.

551
00:36:08,033 --> 00:36:11,350
Because the reality of time is eminent.

552
00:36:11,966 --> 00:36:14,032
In the future, you'll get to know some people.

553
00:36:14,033 --> 00:36:15,765
Encounter different circumstances.

554
00:36:15,766 --> 00:36:17,965
Their selfishness will let you realize

555
00:36:17,966 --> 00:36:20,866
that forever doesn't exist in this world.

556
00:36:22,433 --> 00:36:27,765
So please don't use forever casually, okay?

557
00:36:31,333 --> 00:36:33,533
But I'm not them.

558
00:36:34,566 --> 00:36:37,065
You can say that I'm young.

559
00:36:37,066 --> 00:36:39,150
You can say I don't understand.

560
00:36:40,033 --> 00:36:42,800
But you can't say that I won't love someone forever.

561
00:36:44,766 --> 00:36:47,220
Whether you're a guy or a girl,

562
00:36:48,066 --> 00:36:50,165
my body is telling me

563
00:36:50,166 --> 00:36:52,166
I just want you.

564
00:36:58,633 --> 00:37:00,230
Not possible.

565
00:38:00,866 --> 00:38:03,965
Again with the frowning. Am I that ugly?

566
00:38:03,965 --> 00:38:05,366
What do you want now?

567
00:38:05,366 --> 00:38:07,432
Can you say something else?

568
00:38:07,433 --> 00:38:09,466
What do you want?

569
00:38:13,166 --> 00:38:13,934
Eat this lunch box.

570
00:38:13,934 --> 00:38:16,166
You didn't eat anything for lunch.

571
00:38:16,166 --> 00:38:17,799
And just now had a bun.

572
00:38:17,800 --> 00:38:19,533
How can you not be hungry?

573
00:38:19,533 --> 00:38:21,233
How do you know?

574
00:38:22,333 --> 00:38:23,599
Of course, I know.

575
00:38:23,600 --> 00:38:26,766
I also know that at nine o'clock the security will come to lock the doors.

576
00:38:26,766 --> 00:38:28,900
So you better eat fast.

577
00:38:28,900 --> 00:38:31,133
You've been stalking and watching me.

578
00:38:31,133 --> 00:38:33,399
Of course.

579
00:38:33,400 --> 00:38:35,265
My love instructor told me

580
00:38:35,266 --> 00:38:37,899
that to like someone is to watch them,

581
00:38:37,900 --> 00:38:41,032
understand him, and control him.

582
00:38:41,033 --> 00:38:43,032
Give it your all.

583
00:38:43,033 --> 00:38:44,599
Then win you over.

584
00:38:44,600 --> 00:38:47,432
Let you like me.

585
00:38:47,433 --> 00:38:48,733
What do you want?

586
00:38:48,733 --> 00:38:50,433
A lot.

587
00:38:50,433 --> 00:38:52,610
I have a crush on you.

588
00:38:59,800 --> 00:39:02,200
Let me ask you.

589
00:39:02,200 --> 00:39:03,733
We're both guys.

590
00:39:03,733 --> 00:39:06,000
If we really go out together,

591
00:39:06,000 --> 00:39:08,266
isn't that a lot of pressure?

592
00:39:11,800 --> 00:39:15,933
But making the world our enemy feels pretty good.

593
00:39:15,933 --> 00:39:17,566
I like it.

594
00:39:17,566 --> 00:39:21,766
You're thinking too much. That day won't come.

595
00:39:23,633 --> 00:39:25,833
Okay, stop studying.

596
00:39:25,833 --> 00:39:27,600
Eat the lunchbox.

597
00:39:31,566 --> 00:39:33,200
You're not eating?

598
00:39:34,266 --> 00:39:37,533
You're wasting it if you don't eat it.

599
00:39:40,866 --> 00:39:42,666
You'll go to hell.

600
00:39:51,566 --> 00:39:54,066
Then consider it a gift of my apology.

601
00:40:00,366 --> 00:40:01,866
Plus!

602
00:40:02,866 --> 00:40:06,274
If you eat the lunchbox, starting today, you can ask me to do anything.

603
00:40:06,274 --> 00:40:09,132
And I'll agree. I said it, I'll do it.

604
00:40:10,266 --> 00:40:13,200
- Okay, then I want you--
- Not being able to see you doesn't count!

605
00:40:14,433 --> 00:40:17,348
- Then you can't--
- Not being able to think of you also doesn't count!

606
00:40:20,761 --> 00:40:21,853
Then...

607
00:40:21,853 --> 00:40:24,719
Not being able to chase after you, for sure doesn't count!

608
00:40:29,933 --> 00:40:32,399
Aren't you being too ridiculous?

609
00:40:32,400 --> 00:40:35,599
I've already done so much!

610
00:40:35,600 --> 00:40:38,165
It kind of hurts.

611
00:40:38,166 --> 00:40:40,260
It makes me want to cry.

612
00:40:44,800 --> 00:40:46,599
Stop studying.

613
00:40:46,600 --> 00:40:48,266
Where are you going? Hurry up and eat.

614
00:40:48,266 --> 00:40:49,832
I don't want to.

615
00:40:49,833 --> 00:40:51,299
You don't want to?

616
00:40:51,300 --> 00:40:53,699
If you don't, I'll have to get rough.

617
00:40:53,700 --> 00:40:57,499
If you dare hit me, I'll tell the school instructor tomorrow.

618
00:40:57,499 --> 00:41:00,099
Fine. Go tell him.

619
00:41:00,099 --> 00:41:01,690
Then I won't be polite.

620
00:41:01,700 --> 00:41:04,632
Are you standing up to me because you want me to kiss you?

621
00:41:06,033 --> 00:41:06,833
Lunchbox or me?

622
00:41:06,834 --> 00:41:08,433
Choose one!

623
00:41:10,233 --> 00:41:12,965
Three, two, one.

624
00:41:12,966 --> 00:41:15,233
Lunchbox! Lunchbox.

625
00:41:15,233 --> 00:41:17,233
I pick the lunchbox.

626
00:42:02,866 --> 00:42:05,165
This is my house.

627
00:42:05,166 --> 00:42:07,199
Usually, you take 26 minutes.

628
00:42:07,200 --> 00:42:09,066
Today, you only took 21 minutes.

629
00:42:09,066 --> 00:42:11,600
You really hate being around me that much?

630
00:42:11,600 --> 00:42:13,732
You can leave now.

631
00:42:13,733 --> 00:42:15,532
Can I come pick you up tomorrow?

632
00:42:15,533 --> 00:42:16,599
No, I'm studying tomorrow.

633
00:42:16,600 --> 00:42:17,665
Tomorrow?

634
00:42:17,666 --> 00:42:20,933
Morning, afternoon, or evening. I'm free.

635
00:42:20,933 --> 00:42:22,666
Morning, afternoon, and evening: I will need to study.

636
00:42:22,666 --> 00:42:24,566
Then let's study together.

637
00:42:26,766 --> 00:42:30,666
Please, I just want to be with you.

638
00:42:30,666 --> 00:42:32,180
Really.

639
00:42:32,966 --> 00:42:36,467
Okay. Come in the morning, leave after you eat lunch. That's that.

640
00:42:36,467 --> 00:42:37,800
Okay.

641
00:42:39,000 --> 00:42:40,466
Bye-bye.

642
00:42:41,633 --> 00:42:43,533
Goodnight.

643
00:42:44,600 --> 00:42:46,100
See you tomorrow.

644
00:44:11,370 --> 00:44:16,520
[Drunk Cafe]

645
00:44:31,066 --> 00:44:33,100
Bar?

646
00:44:34,133 --> 00:44:36,100
What's he doing here?

647
00:45:11,766 --> 00:45:13,965
Do you have a reservation, sir?

648
00:45:13,966 --> 00:45:15,320
Sir!

649
00:45:16,920 --> 00:45:18,360
Sir!

650
00:45:19,166 --> 00:45:21,033
Come with me.

651
00:45:21,033 --> 00:45:21,966
Let go!

652
00:45:21,967 --> 00:45:24,333
Student, what do you want?

653
00:45:28,066 --> 00:45:29,465
What are you doing?

654
00:45:29,466 --> 00:45:31,765
Wait!

655
00:45:31,766 --> 00:45:33,600
- What are you doing?
- Why are you fighting?

656
00:45:57,020 --> 00:45:58,990
Get away!

657
00:46:00,700 --> 00:46:02,266
What are you crying for?

658
00:46:02,266 --> 00:46:04,833
Do you know what this place is?

659
00:46:04,833 --> 00:46:06,400
You work here? What's your problem?

660
00:46:06,400 --> 00:46:08,565
The one with the problem is you!

661
00:46:08,566 --> 00:46:10,365
I knew you were fooling with me.

662
00:46:10,366 --> 00:46:13,266
- Just waiting for this chance, right? Destroy everything that I've worked for.
- I didn't.

663
00:46:13,266 --> 00:46:15,300
Xiang Haoting, I'm begging you to let me off the hook.

664
00:46:15,301 --> 00:46:17,566
Stop harassing me, okay?

665
00:46:19,833 --> 00:46:22,366
What do you want me to do to make you feel good and satisfied?

666
00:46:22,366 --> 00:46:24,533
You want me to kneel?

667
00:46:27,900 --> 00:46:30,166
I'm sorry.

668
00:46:30,166 --> 00:46:32,733
I can't be a character in your game.

669
00:46:32,733 --> 00:46:34,300
I don't have money.

670
00:46:34,300 --> 00:46:36,799
I'm not like you.

671
00:46:36,800 --> 00:46:38,300
I really need to make money.

672
00:46:38,300 --> 00:46:39,841
If I don't get the scholarship,

673
00:46:39,866 --> 00:46:42,900
I won't be able to afford next semester's tuition.

674
00:46:42,900 --> 00:46:45,433
Can you please spare me a chance?

675
00:46:49,720 --> 00:46:55,100
♫ I still don’t understand why you left ♫

676
00:46:55,100 --> 00:47:01,170
♫ I still don’t understand why I’m waiting ♫

677
00:47:01,170 --> 00:47:06,950
♫ Waiting for who will remember their responsibility ♫

678
00:47:06,950 --> 00:47:12,690
♫ I’m left at the original place wandering around alone ♫

679
00:47:12,690 --> 00:47:18,200
♫ When the blue sky and white clouds disappear ♫

680
00:47:18,200 --> 00:47:23,510
♫ When you take away the yellow sneakers and the red sweater ♫

681
00:47:23,510 --> 00:47:28,710
♫ When all the colors are gone along with you ♫

682
00:47:28,710 --> 00:47:35,650
♫ Only transparent tears that unceasingly fall accompany me ♫

683
00:47:35,650 --> 00:47:41,030
♫ I still don’t understand why you left ♫

684
00:47:41,030 --> 00:47:47,040
♫ I still don’t understand why I’m waiting ♫

685
00:47:47,040 --> 00:47:52,870
♫ Waiting for who will remember their responsibility ♫

686
00:47:52,870 --> 00:47:57,160
♫ I’m left at the original place wandering around alone ♫

687
00:47:57,160 --> 00:48:02,550
♫ When one story becomes two regrets ♫

688
00:48:02,550 --> 00:48:08,820
♫ Letting two hearts run towards two different futures ♫

689
00:48:08,820 --> 00:48:14,350
♫ All those that can’t be forgotten can only become regrets ♫

690
00:48:14,350 --> 00:48:21,690
♫ But I still can’t understand why the tears won’t stop ♫
