[HIStory 3: Make Our Days Count]
[Episode 9]

14
00:01:38,400 --> 00:01:39,250
Hey?

15
00:01:39,251 --> 00:01:41,300
That tickles.

16
00:01:43,200 --> 00:01:45,133
What are you doing?

17
00:01:59,200 --> 00:02:01,200
What do you want?

18
00:03:07,900 --> 00:03:10,100
Are you all right?

19
00:03:24,700 --> 00:03:26,700
Are you afraid of me?

20
00:03:32,100 --> 00:03:33,900
I'm sorry.

21
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:49,100
I didn't do it on purpose.

22
00:04:30,200 --> 00:04:33,900
- Thanks for coming.
- Thanks for coming!

23
00:04:33,900 --> 00:04:35,532
Brown sugar, cocoa steamed buns.

24
00:04:35,533 --> 00:04:36,599
They're delicious!

25
00:04:36,600 --> 00:04:38,532
Remember to come back and try them next time!

26
00:04:38,533 --> 00:04:40,100
Bye-bye.

27
00:05:08,333 --> 00:05:10,200
What are you looking at?

28
00:05:11,533 --> 00:05:12,699
Nothing.

29
00:05:12,700 --> 00:05:15,200
Don't you think that Little Gu Looks a little off today?

30
00:05:15,200 --> 00:05:17,600
Like he's got something on his mind.

31
00:05:17,600 --> 00:05:19,799
What could it be?

32
00:05:19,800 --> 00:05:22,700
He's leaving for vacation with Xiang Haoting in a couple of days.

33
00:05:32,900 --> 00:05:35,400
You're not jealous again, are you?

34
00:05:36,100 --> 00:05:39,599
You seem to care a lot about him and not me.

35
00:05:42,500 --> 00:05:45,599
Except for sleeping four hours a day,

36
00:05:45,600 --> 00:05:48,699
I spend the rest of my time either with you,

37
00:05:48,700 --> 00:05:51,199
or thinking about you.

38
00:05:51,200 --> 00:05:53,399
What about when you're sleeping?

39
00:05:53,400 --> 00:05:55,732
Do you dream about me?

40
00:05:55,733 --> 00:05:58,732
Do I appear in your dreams?

41
00:05:58,733 --> 00:06:00,099
Of course.

42
00:06:00,100 --> 00:06:02,332
And you even told me,

43
00:06:02,333 --> 00:06:04,899
you wanted to go on vacation and spend two days and one night with me.

44
00:06:04,900 --> 00:06:06,532
Sure!

45
00:06:06,533 --> 00:06:07,799
You said it!

46
00:06:07,800 --> 00:06:09,800
You said it, so you have to mean it.

47
00:06:10,900 --> 00:06:13,499
Tomorrow, we'll go with Xiang Haoting on a double date!

48
00:06:13,500 --> 00:06:15,000
Tomorrow and the day after we're closed!

49
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:17,300
Why are we closed?

50
00:06:18,100 --> 00:06:19,399
No need to close.

51
00:06:19,400 --> 00:06:22,032
- I'll just ask Judy to come and fill in.
- Okay.

52
00:06:22,032 --> 00:06:23,199
I'll start planning.

53
00:06:23,200 --> 00:06:24,599
Whatever you say!

54
00:06:24,600 --> 00:06:28,100
Then let me check up on what is good to eat there.

55
00:06:30,200 --> 00:06:33,633
Recommended restaurants, good to eat, delicious foods...

56
00:06:34,800 --> 00:06:37,199
French meal set.

57
00:06:37,200 --> 00:06:40,000
So romantic, must eat.

58
00:06:43,500 --> 00:06:45,600
- We're finally here.
- My God!

59
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:49,399
This place feels like Bali!

60
00:06:49,400 --> 00:06:50,999
What do you think? You've never been there, have you?

61
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:53,099
I've been before.

62
00:06:53,100 --> 00:06:55,099
Then going forward, you're only allowed to go with me.

63
00:06:55,100 --> 00:06:56,599
Then, what about company trips?

64
00:06:56,600 --> 00:06:59,199
You have to bring me on company trips, too.

65
00:06:59,200 --> 00:07:01,500
We'll see how you behave.

66
00:07:01,500 --> 00:07:03,200
Jerk.

67
00:07:05,200 --> 00:07:06,799
I'll go check-in first.

68
00:07:06,800 --> 00:07:10,500
Wait! Take a picture first. Take a picture.

69
00:07:10,500 --> 00:07:12,099
Little Gu, hurry and come over.

70
00:07:12,100 --> 00:07:14,432
Come on, let's get a picture. Hurry!

71
00:07:14,432 --> 00:07:16,799
It's not often we're able to go on a vacation.

72
00:07:16,800 --> 00:07:19,199
One, two, three!

73
00:07:19,200 --> 00:07:22,299
Cheer up and be happy, okay? We're on vacation.

74
00:07:24,600 --> 00:07:26,400
Okay, that's good.

75
00:07:29,300 --> 00:07:31,333
Brother Chigang, let me get one with you.

76
00:07:32,400 --> 00:07:35,732
- How are you?
- Are you Mr. Xiang?

77
00:07:35,733 --> 00:07:37,599
This is your room card.

78
00:07:37,600 --> 00:07:40,699
- Thank you.
- Can you please fill this out for me?

79
00:07:44,100 --> 00:07:46,200
- Yours.
- Thanks.

80
00:07:50,600 --> 00:07:53,500
Little Gu, what's wrong?

81
00:07:53,500 --> 00:07:55,099
You don't like it here?

82
00:07:55,100 --> 00:07:57,599
No. It's beautiful here.

83
00:07:57,599 --> 00:07:59,599
Brother Chigang, let's go check it out.

84
00:07:59,600 --> 00:08:01,300
- Sure.
- Let's go.

85
00:08:01,300 --> 00:08:03,700
Come on. We'll head up first!

86
00:08:04,500 --> 00:08:05,900
Let's go!

87
00:08:07,100 --> 00:08:08,500
I'm sorry.

88
00:08:08,500 --> 00:08:11,433
Do your rooms only have double beds?

89
00:08:11,433 --> 00:08:12,799
None have two single beds?

90
00:08:12,800 --> 00:08:15,199
That's right, all of our rooms have double beds.

91
00:08:15,200 --> 00:08:16,299
Okay, thanks.

92
00:08:16,300 --> 00:08:17,700
No problem.

93
00:09:14,433 --> 00:09:16,632
I'll sleep here tonight.

94
00:09:17,700 --> 00:09:19,733
You can have the bed.

95
00:09:33,800 --> 00:09:35,650
Xiang Haoting.

96
00:09:36,500 --> 00:09:38,599
I think I forgot my bathing trunks.

97
00:09:38,600 --> 00:09:40,199
I wonder if there's a place around here that sells some.

98
00:09:40,200 --> 00:09:41,599
Let me go see.

99
00:09:41,600 --> 00:09:43,500
It's quite beautiful here. You can go take a look around.

100
00:09:43,500 --> 00:09:46,799
I'll leave you the key.

101
00:09:46,800 --> 00:09:48,700
I'll be back a bit later.

102
00:10:07,900 --> 00:10:12,232
Brother Chigang, I really don't know what to do.

103
00:10:12,232 --> 00:10:15,632
He asked me if I was afraid of him, but I'm not.

104
00:10:15,632 --> 00:10:18,199
I really like being with him,

105
00:10:18,200 --> 00:10:20,900
and also like seeing him smile at me.

106
00:10:22,100 --> 00:10:24,699
But I really don't understand why it's like this now.

107
00:10:24,700 --> 00:10:26,299
The more he treats me nicely,

108
00:10:26,300 --> 00:10:28,530
the closer he gets to me,

109
00:10:29,300 --> 00:10:30,900
I just...

110
00:10:32,700 --> 00:10:34,732
Just want to hide from him?

111
00:10:34,733 --> 00:10:36,100
Exactly.

112
00:10:36,800 --> 00:10:38,999
This is love.

113
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:41,732
He does what he does because he really cares for you.

114
00:10:41,733 --> 00:10:45,199
If you really have any concerns, just tell him directly.

115
00:10:45,900 --> 00:10:47,699
You have to have more confidence in yourself.

116
00:10:47,700 --> 00:10:49,899
Trust your own feelings.

117
00:10:49,900 --> 00:10:52,200
Have the courage to follow your heart.

118
00:11:08,500 --> 00:11:10,500
It's about time.

119
00:11:10,500 --> 00:11:12,300
We can go and eat.

120
00:11:23,300 --> 00:11:26,400
I really, really like you

121
00:11:28,900 --> 00:11:32,999
I'm truly very happy every day I get to spend with you.

122
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:37,199
It's been so perfect that it seems I can have it all.

123
00:11:46,200 --> 00:11:48,470
I'm sorry I pushed you away.

124
00:11:49,100 --> 00:11:51,899
I've never liked anyone before,

125
00:11:51,900 --> 00:11:54,199
so I'm afraid.

126
00:11:54,200 --> 00:11:57,621
I don't know what part of me deserves to be liked by someone else.

127
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:00,600
I'm sorry.

128
00:12:04,600 --> 00:12:06,900
You don't need to be afraid from now on.

129
00:12:13,400 --> 00:12:15,533
Because you are here.

130
00:12:17,600 --> 00:12:20,000
You complete me.

131
00:12:54,700 --> 00:12:56,500
I love you.

132
00:13:01,483 --> 00:13:03,333
I love you, too.

133
00:14:51,900 --> 00:14:53,999
We're on vacation today.

134
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:56,400
You should take a vacation, too.

135
00:14:57,700 --> 00:15:00,100
Where do you want to go? You want to go there?

136
00:15:00,100 --> 00:15:03,599
Go ahead. Make yourself at home.

137
00:15:03,599 --> 00:15:05,900
I really can't stand you.

138
00:15:11,301 --> 00:15:13,599
It's already seven-thirty.

139
00:15:13,600 --> 00:15:15,800
Why hasn't Xiang Haoting come down yet?

140
00:15:19,050 --> 00:15:21,682
I'm being serious.

141
00:15:21,683 --> 00:15:24,449
Didn't you think they were kind of strange today?

142
00:15:24,450 --> 00:15:28,249
From the minute I stepped into the hotel, I noticed that Xiang Haoting was upset.

143
00:15:28,249 --> 00:15:30,682
Being on vacation means to relax and just take it easy.

144
00:15:30,683 --> 00:15:33,182
Here. Don't be picky with your food.

145
00:15:33,182 --> 00:15:34,449
I don't want it.

146
00:15:34,450 --> 00:15:36,050
I'm feeding you.

147
00:15:46,750 --> 00:15:48,249
That's not right.

148
00:15:48,250 --> 00:15:51,049
Xiang Haoting was the one that picked this restaurant.

149
00:15:51,050 --> 00:15:53,350
If he doesn't come, what's he going to eat?

150
00:15:53,350 --> 00:15:55,649
I'm going to call him.

151
00:15:55,650 --> 00:15:57,549
Student Sun Boxiang,

152
00:15:57,550 --> 00:16:00,782
from the minute you sat down, you've been "A-hao, A-hao, A-hao."

153
00:16:00,782 --> 00:16:02,149
Am I really the one in your heart?

154
00:16:02,150 --> 00:16:04,050
If you keep this up, I'm going to move to the next table.

155
00:16:04,050 --> 00:16:06,450
All right, all right! I'm sorry.

156
00:16:06,450 --> 00:16:08,350
Go ahead and eat.

157
00:16:11,050 --> 00:16:13,183
- What's wrong?
- Nothing.

158
00:16:13,183 --> 00:16:15,449
- Somethings wrong for sure!
- That tickles.

159
00:16:15,449 --> 00:16:18,150
- Are you jealous?
- That tickles!

160
00:16:18,150 --> 00:16:19,749
No!

161
00:16:19,750 --> 00:16:22,049
You get jealous so easily.

162
00:16:22,050 --> 00:16:23,950
But I like it.

163
00:16:25,750 --> 00:16:27,250
Jealous pot.

164
00:16:56,650 --> 00:16:58,850
This feels so good.

165
00:17:00,050 --> 00:17:02,950
I wish there were 48 hours today.

166
00:17:05,550 --> 00:17:08,050
So happy. (Japanese)

167
00:17:09,483 --> 00:17:11,349
Do you think you're filming a commercial?

168
00:17:11,350 --> 00:17:13,049
What do you know?

169
00:17:13,050 --> 00:17:14,149
This is being romantic, okay?

170
00:17:14,150 --> 00:17:16,450
- Romantic?
- That's right!

171
00:17:16,450 --> 00:17:18,050
Let me help you.

172
00:17:23,150 --> 00:17:24,482
How's that?

173
00:17:24,483 --> 00:17:26,351
That's nice. Here, too.

174
00:17:26,351 --> 00:17:27,583
Okay.

175
00:17:31,650 --> 00:17:34,080
Let's take a trip around the world, should we?

176
00:17:34,950 --> 00:17:36,549
Sure.

177
00:17:36,550 --> 00:17:38,249
We can go to Africa.

178
00:17:38,250 --> 00:17:40,649
See the elephants and giraffes!

179
00:17:40,650 --> 00:17:43,949
Then go to Iceland to see the Aurora Borealis.

180
00:17:43,950 --> 00:17:45,949
Go to the North Pole to see the penguins.

181
00:17:45,950 --> 00:17:48,749
- Or go to Serbia to see–
- Wait.

182
00:17:48,750 --> 00:17:50,049
There are no penguins at the North Pole.

183
00:17:50,050 --> 00:17:52,149
Penguins are in the South Pole.

184
00:17:52,150 --> 00:17:54,549
Don't make fun of me!

185
00:17:54,550 --> 00:17:57,450
I really don't know how you got into Cheng Kung University.

186
00:17:57,450 --> 00:17:58,649
I studied really hard to get in!

187
00:17:58,650 --> 00:18:00,282
Studied really hard?

188
00:18:00,283 --> 00:18:02,650
- Are you sure?
- Get away.

189
00:18:02,650 --> 00:18:04,082
Are you getting upset over a little joke?

190
00:18:04,083 --> 00:18:06,450
Here, let me comfort you.

191
00:18:09,350 --> 00:18:11,883
Fine. Don't be angry, baby.

192
00:18:12,750 --> 00:18:14,282
Let me ask you.

193
00:18:14,283 --> 00:18:17,449
If you can pick one place to go to right now,

194
00:18:17,450 --> 00:18:19,749
where would you want to go?

195
00:18:19,750 --> 00:18:21,883
I can only pick one place?

196
00:18:24,350 --> 00:18:26,583
Then I'd want to go with you...

197
00:18:28,683 --> 00:18:30,383
back to our room.

198
00:18:32,550 --> 00:18:33,450
No!

199
00:18:33,450 --> 00:18:34,450
Why not?

200
00:18:34,451 --> 00:18:36,049
- I don't want to go back to our room with you.
- Go back to our room.

201
00:18:36,050 --> 00:18:37,050
You want to go to sleep?

202
00:18:37,050 --> 00:18:37,950
That's right.

203
00:18:37,951 --> 00:18:39,549
You want to sleep this early?

204
00:18:39,550 --> 00:18:40,649
I can't go to sleep?

205
00:18:40,650 --> 00:18:42,550
You can't.

206
00:19:21,550 --> 00:19:23,050
Good morning.

207
00:19:51,650 --> 00:19:53,650
Let's go get breakfast.

208
00:19:55,950 --> 00:19:57,450
I don't want to.

209
00:19:58,350 --> 00:20:02,450
I don't want to!

210
00:20:02,450 --> 00:20:04,050
I don't want to!

211
00:20:05,780 --> 00:20:08,030
Then, what do you want to do?

212
00:20:11,680 --> 00:20:13,510
I want...

213
00:20:14,580 --> 00:20:17,579
to hold you all day long

214
00:20:17,580 --> 00:20:19,680
and go nowhere.

215
00:20:46,080 --> 00:20:47,480
Little Gu.

216
00:20:48,580 --> 00:20:50,030
Hurry up and look at this!

217
00:20:51,530 --> 00:20:53,480
Not bad.

218
00:20:55,380 --> 00:20:57,680
Did he tell you he was getting a new scooter?

219
00:20:58,880 --> 00:21:00,279
Brother Chigang, I'm going to head out.

220
00:21:00,280 --> 00:21:01,780
Sure, bye-bye.

221
00:21:09,580 --> 00:21:10,712
Why do you have this scooter?

222
00:21:10,713 --> 00:21:11,979
My parents got it for me.

223
00:21:11,980 --> 00:21:13,979
They said that this will be easier for me to commute with.

224
00:21:13,980 --> 00:21:15,379
Easier to get to the train station.

225
00:21:15,380 --> 00:21:17,180
It's so cool!

226
00:21:20,180 --> 00:21:22,680
But you don't have a license, do you?

227
00:21:26,580 --> 00:21:27,580
Hot off the printing press!

228
00:21:27,581 --> 00:21:29,679
Just got it this morning.

229
00:21:29,680 --> 00:21:30,912
Not bad.

230
00:21:30,913 --> 00:21:32,980
Of course.

231
00:21:34,380 --> 00:21:35,180
- Cool!
- Let me help you put on your helmet.

232
00:21:35,180 --> 00:21:36,180
Okay.

233
00:21:38,680 --> 00:21:40,179
The rain's getting heavy.

234
00:21:40,180 --> 00:21:41,479
Should we still ride?

235
00:21:41,480 --> 00:21:42,979
Of course.

236
00:21:42,980 --> 00:21:46,079
Don't you think that riding in the rain is really romantic?

237
00:21:47,980 --> 00:21:51,580
You're the first person I want to take for a ride.

238
00:21:55,680 --> 00:21:57,179
Let's go.

239
00:21:57,180 --> 00:21:59,579
But won't this be bad for the scooter?

240
00:21:59,580 --> 00:22:00,979
No way.

241
00:22:00,980 --> 00:22:02,480
Get on.

242
00:22:12,180 --> 00:22:14,480
- Let's go.
- Okay, go!

243
00:22:16,980 --> 00:22:19,312
This weather is really like you.

244
00:22:19,313 --> 00:22:20,579
Why?

245
00:22:20,580 --> 00:22:22,379
Changes whenever it feels like it.

246
00:22:22,380 --> 00:22:25,880
Sunny and cloudy with intermittent showers.

247
00:22:29,780 --> 00:22:31,979
I hope that it stops raining soon.

248
00:22:31,980 --> 00:22:34,379
Trust me, it won't.

249
00:22:34,380 --> 00:22:36,679
Why?

250
00:22:36,680 --> 00:22:39,780
Because my sun is behind me right now.

251
00:22:51,680 --> 00:22:54,280
Chungli is pretty far from Taipei.

252
00:22:56,080 --> 00:22:57,579
You're scared I'll be tired.

253
00:22:57,580 --> 00:22:59,279
I'm just worried about you.

254
00:22:59,280 --> 00:23:02,830
Coming up with excuses for not having time to study.

255
00:23:03,680 --> 00:23:05,480
That's quite possible.

256
00:23:11,180 --> 00:23:12,380
Hold on tight.

257
00:23:12,380 --> 00:23:14,080
Okay.

258
00:23:26,180 --> 00:23:30,280
I really want to introduce you to this friend of mine.

259
00:23:30,280 --> 00:23:33,479
But just dropping in like this and not getting anything for them,

260
00:23:33,479 --> 00:23:34,979
isn't that kind of rude?

261
00:23:34,980 --> 00:23:36,913
It should be okay.

262
00:23:41,080 --> 00:23:44,780
- Sorry to disturb you.
- Sorry to disturb you.

263
00:23:50,080 --> 00:23:51,480
This...

264
00:23:51,480 --> 00:23:54,579
What do you think? Do you like my friend?

265
00:23:54,579 --> 00:23:57,579
Isn't this the place we looked at together?

266
00:23:57,580 --> 00:23:59,512
This will be our home now.

267
00:23:59,513 --> 00:24:00,480
Really?

268
00:24:00,481 --> 00:24:01,779
I rented this place.

269
00:24:01,780 --> 00:24:03,180
You--

270
00:24:16,280 --> 00:24:17,280
This...

271
00:24:19,580 --> 00:24:21,679
What an awesome kitchen!

272
00:24:21,680 --> 00:24:24,280
We can cook together.

273
00:24:26,280 --> 00:24:27,879
This is that picture?

274
00:24:27,880 --> 00:24:29,579
Yeah.

275
00:24:29,580 --> 00:24:31,713
Wet and dry bathroom?

276
00:24:33,113 --> 00:24:34,179
Wooden floors?

277
00:24:34,180 --> 00:24:37,379
Didn't you always want a comfortable space to draw,

278
00:24:37,379 --> 00:24:39,680
and to hang all of your little things?

279
00:24:43,313 --> 00:24:45,880
I love a place with a balcony the most.

280
00:24:51,480 --> 00:24:53,079
It's bigger in person.

281
00:24:53,080 --> 00:24:55,380
This is where we're sleeping.

282
00:25:05,380 --> 00:25:07,680
What a beautiful blue color.

283
00:25:09,080 --> 00:25:11,679
But this place is really expensive.

284
00:25:11,680 --> 00:25:13,079
Yeah, it's pretty expensive.

285
00:25:13,080 --> 00:25:15,679
But we ran into a really good landlord.

286
00:25:15,680 --> 00:25:17,779
I tried a lot of different methods and was persistent

287
00:25:17,780 --> 00:25:19,779
until he finally gave us a good deal.

288
00:25:19,780 --> 00:25:22,780
I managed to get it within our budget.

289
00:25:24,780 --> 00:25:26,580
You really are something!

290
00:25:30,680 --> 00:25:33,079
We still need to buy a lot of things.

291
00:25:33,080 --> 00:25:34,179
I've already got that figured out.

292
00:25:34,180 --> 00:25:36,779
I want to put a projector here which will show onto here.

293
00:25:36,780 --> 00:25:39,380
This way we can play video games all day.

294
00:25:39,380 --> 00:25:40,979
Then, the dining area seems a bit boring.

295
00:25:40,980 --> 00:25:45,679
So, I thought about converting it to a sort of castle for Whitey.

296
00:25:45,679 --> 00:25:47,579
That's pretty creative, right?

297
00:25:47,580 --> 00:25:49,680
And over here. Here, we have to put a couch.

298
00:25:49,680 --> 00:25:51,712
See, the sun comes in from here.

299
00:25:51,713 --> 00:25:54,280
We can lie here all day.

300
00:25:54,980 --> 00:25:56,480
It'll be so wonderful.

301
00:25:57,980 --> 00:26:00,179
If you put the couch here,

302
00:26:00,180 --> 00:26:01,880
then how do we get to the balcony?

303
00:26:01,880 --> 00:26:02,979
Geez.

304
00:26:02,980 --> 00:26:03,980
It won't matter!

305
00:26:03,981 --> 00:26:05,679
Isn't this how Nordic style is like?

306
00:26:05,680 --> 00:26:08,580
Drink coffee and sit in the sun all day long?

307
00:26:09,780 --> 00:26:11,880
Silly!

308
00:26:16,180 --> 00:26:18,580
We'll be living our lives together here.

309
00:26:22,180 --> 00:26:23,879
Thank you.

310
00:26:23,880 --> 00:26:27,613
With you, I feel really lucky.

311
00:26:27,613 --> 00:26:29,580
Me, too.

312
00:27:13,413 --> 00:27:15,080
Xiang Haoting.

313
00:27:16,080 --> 00:27:18,880
University life isn't like high school.

314
00:27:18,880 --> 00:27:21,379
I think you really should move closer to the school.

315
00:27:21,380 --> 00:27:24,080
It'll be more convenient and it's a much easier commute.

316
00:27:27,113 --> 00:27:28,279
I already rented the place.

317
00:27:28,280 --> 00:27:30,613
Can we not talk about this anymore?

318
00:27:36,213 --> 00:27:38,880
You'll graduate in four years, right?

319
00:27:39,980 --> 00:27:41,079
Of course.

320
00:27:41,080 --> 00:27:43,979
I'll have to get a job as soon as I graduate.

321
00:27:43,980 --> 00:27:47,179
He'll continue his studies for sure.

322
00:27:47,180 --> 00:27:48,579
I'll need to make a lot of money,

323
00:27:48,580 --> 00:27:51,679
to help him out and support him.

324
00:28:06,280 --> 00:28:08,879
I've already kept up my part of our agreement.

325
00:28:08,880 --> 00:28:10,313
Dad,

326
00:28:12,013 --> 00:28:14,679
you'll keep your word as well. Right?

327
00:28:38,680 --> 00:28:40,879
Even though you're moving out, you still need to come and visit often.

328
00:28:40,880 --> 00:28:43,180
Remember you still have a mother and sister.

329
00:28:45,313 --> 00:28:47,913
Don't let them worry too much.

330
00:29:12,580 --> 00:29:13,581
Thanks for the hard work.

331
00:29:13,581 --> 00:29:15,180
You, too.

332
00:29:32,680 --> 00:29:33,580
All together!

333
00:29:33,581 --> 00:29:34,712
Here!

334
00:29:34,713 --> 00:29:37,280
- Just leave your shoes at the door.
- Put them by the door, thanks.

335
00:29:37,280 --> 00:29:38,980
You all came together.

336
00:29:40,580 --> 00:29:41,480
Your place is huge!

337
00:29:41,481 --> 00:29:43,579
Little love nest!

338
00:29:43,580 --> 00:29:45,079
Yu Shi.

339
00:29:45,080 --> 00:29:46,480
Thanks.

340
00:29:48,080 --> 00:29:50,379
Where's Brother Chigang?

341
00:29:50,380 --> 00:29:51,679
He went to take care of the store.

342
00:29:51,680 --> 00:29:53,312
He'll come by later.

343
00:29:53,313 --> 00:29:54,113
Then, take a seat first.

344
00:29:54,113 --> 00:29:55,913
Okay! Thanks.

345
00:29:55,913 --> 00:29:57,679
Shigu.

346
00:29:57,680 --> 00:29:58,481
Thank you.

347
00:29:58,481 --> 00:30:00,879
There's even a balcony?

348
00:30:00,880 --> 00:30:02,579
This is too luxurious.

349
00:30:02,580 --> 00:30:03,681
- Pretty expensive, right?
- No really.

350
00:30:03,681 --> 00:30:04,979
Just NT$8,000.

351
00:30:04,980 --> 00:30:06,679
No way, this is at least NT$18,000.

352
00:30:06,680 --> 00:30:08,279
Right!

353
00:30:08,280 --> 00:30:09,379
He was really something.

354
00:30:09,380 --> 00:30:12,912
Originally, it was NT$18,000. He got it down to NT$8,000!

355
00:30:14,180 --> 00:30:16,713
NT$8,000?

356
00:30:23,180 --> 00:30:24,779
That's amazing!

357
00:30:24,780 --> 00:30:26,979
No wonder you're the king of bargaining!

358
00:30:26,980 --> 00:30:28,279
Really!

359
00:30:28,280 --> 00:30:31,279
Okay, let me go and prepare.

360
00:30:31,280 --> 00:30:32,080
I'll help you.

361
00:30:32,081 --> 00:30:33,580
Sure!

362
00:30:36,280 --> 00:30:38,179
Next time, let's get our stories straight ahead of time.

363
00:30:38,180 --> 00:30:39,180
Such a considerate guy.

364
00:30:39,181 --> 00:30:40,579
Silly.

365
00:30:40,580 --> 00:30:42,512
The washrooms here if you need it.

366
00:30:42,513 --> 00:30:44,679
Okay.

367
00:30:44,680 --> 00:30:46,479
Where's your room?

368
00:30:46,480 --> 00:30:48,313
Here.

369
00:30:50,880 --> 00:30:53,112
Raid!

370
00:30:53,113 --> 00:30:55,512
Wait!

371
00:30:55,513 --> 00:30:56,579
What's there to see?

372
00:30:56,580 --> 00:30:58,312
Why can't we look?

373
00:30:58,313 --> 00:30:59,679
Okay, just one look.

374
00:30:59,680 --> 00:31:01,179
Hurry up!

375
00:31:01,180 --> 00:31:02,912
Don't get so excited!

376
00:31:02,913 --> 00:31:05,580
One, two, three!

377
00:31:05,580 --> 00:31:07,479
It's huge!

378
00:31:07,480 --> 00:31:09,779
The bed is huge!

379
00:31:09,780 --> 00:31:11,479
Okay!

380
00:31:11,480 --> 00:31:13,712
No, stop looking!

381
00:31:13,713 --> 00:31:15,779
- Okay!
- Why?

382
00:31:15,780 --> 00:31:17,813
You guys really! What is there to see?

383
00:31:17,813 --> 00:31:20,079
- Just let us take a look.
- Yeah!

384
00:31:20,080 --> 00:31:21,279
It's not convenient.

385
00:31:21,280 --> 00:31:22,280
Such a party pooper!

386
00:31:22,281 --> 00:31:23,379
Okay, just have a seat.

387
00:31:23,380 --> 00:31:24,280
The dishes are getting cold! Hurry!

388
00:31:24,281 --> 00:31:26,979
Being in love has changed you!

389
00:31:26,980 --> 00:31:29,879
What are you guys doing?!

390
00:31:29,880 --> 00:31:31,712
A-de, let me help you.

391
00:31:31,713 --> 00:31:32,580
Be careful.

392
00:31:32,581 --> 00:31:33,879
Thank you.

393
00:31:33,880 --> 00:31:35,079
So extravagant.

394
00:31:35,080 --> 00:31:36,480
Looks amazing!

395
00:31:36,480 --> 00:31:37,380
Let me tell you guys.

396
00:31:37,381 --> 00:31:39,579
This was mostly all his doing.

397
00:31:39,580 --> 00:31:42,779
That's impossible.

398
00:31:42,780 --> 00:31:45,279
I'm suspicious.

399
00:31:45,280 --> 00:31:47,280
But it's really sumptuous.

400
00:31:48,580 --> 00:31:50,512
But how come every dish has carrots?

401
00:31:50,513 --> 00:31:51,779
Shigu loves carrots.

402
00:31:51,780 --> 00:31:53,480
Right!

403
00:31:56,480 --> 00:31:57,512
Where's the meat?

404
00:31:57,513 --> 00:31:59,080
Here.

405
00:32:01,380 --> 00:32:04,479
- That's all?
- That's not enough!

406
00:32:04,480 --> 00:32:06,512
How about we order fried chicken then?

407
00:32:06,513 --> 00:32:07,980
Sure!

408
00:32:09,780 --> 00:32:11,179
What kind of attitude is that?

409
00:32:11,180 --> 00:32:14,079
Don't you know that eating carrots is good for your body?

410
00:32:14,079 --> 00:32:15,679
Understand?

411
00:32:15,680 --> 00:32:17,713
Look at this dish here. See.

412
00:32:17,713 --> 00:32:18,880
- What is it?
- This.

413
00:32:18,880 --> 00:32:19,979
Pick it up.

414
00:32:19,980 --> 00:32:21,512
Right, what is it?

415
00:32:21,513 --> 00:32:23,880
- Dragon ball.
- They're carrots.

416
00:32:23,880 --> 00:32:25,479
ART!

417
00:32:25,480 --> 00:32:27,780
Art, understand?

418
00:32:29,113 --> 00:32:31,379
Creation by Xiang-casso.

419
00:32:31,380 --> 00:32:34,179
- It's beautiful!
- Xiang-casso.

420
00:32:34,180 --> 00:32:36,479
Hurry, let's eat.

421
00:32:36,480 --> 00:32:38,179
Help pass them out!

422
00:32:38,180 --> 00:32:40,112
Here. Chopsticks.

423
00:32:40,113 --> 00:32:41,979
Thank you.

424
00:32:41,980 --> 00:32:44,913
Dig in!

425
00:32:45,980 --> 00:32:47,980
This is for you.

426
00:32:50,113 --> 00:32:51,480
The chicken's almost here.

427
00:32:51,480 --> 00:32:54,313
- Good.
- Great.

428
00:32:54,313 --> 00:32:55,979
You have to order fried chicken.

429
00:32:55,980 --> 00:32:57,179
This is for you.

430
00:32:57,180 --> 00:32:58,180
Thank you.

431
00:32:58,181 --> 00:33:00,280
You're all sweaty.

432
00:33:07,680 --> 00:33:09,912
Do you have to be this romantic even when you're eating?

433
00:33:09,913 --> 00:33:13,279
What? You have something to say?

434
00:33:13,280 --> 00:33:14,979
What is this?

435
00:33:14,980 --> 00:33:17,180
Whitey. My unicorn beetle.

436
00:33:17,180 --> 00:33:19,079
Aren't they supposed to be black?

437
00:33:19,080 --> 00:33:21,513
Yeah, he named it.

438
00:33:25,780 --> 00:33:27,379
Eat.

439
00:33:27,380 --> 00:33:28,980
What kind of logic is this?

440
00:33:29,780 --> 00:33:32,079
What's the logic?

441
00:33:32,080 --> 00:33:32,780
Don't understand.

442
00:33:32,781 --> 00:33:34,380
I want to eat this.

443
00:33:43,080 --> 00:33:45,180
The moon is so beautiful tonight.

444
00:33:47,580 --> 00:33:51,612
Can you guys see it from there?

445
00:33:58,080 --> 00:34:01,179
This afternoon, a lot of friends came over.

446
00:34:01,179 --> 00:34:03,580
We played video games and were really happy.

447
00:34:05,780 --> 00:34:08,380
This was the first time I felt like this.

448
00:34:09,580 --> 00:34:12,030
But I don't know what this is.

449
00:34:18,580 --> 00:34:20,780
Can you guys tell me?

450
00:34:37,080 --> 00:34:40,579
Handsome! Are you alone?

451
00:34:42,380 --> 00:34:43,880
For you.

452
00:34:46,780 --> 00:34:49,379
Were you happy they came by today?

453
00:34:49,380 --> 00:34:50,679
Super happy.

454
00:34:50,680 --> 00:34:53,479
We can have them come over more often and liven up this place.

455
00:34:53,479 --> 00:34:55,179
That would be great!

456
00:34:55,180 --> 00:34:58,279
But I never thought that Gao Chun was like that.

457
00:34:58,280 --> 00:35:01,580
He got so angry for losing by just two points.

458
00:35:02,080 --> 00:35:05,180
You'll have a lot of time to really get to know him.

459
00:35:05,180 --> 00:35:07,579
He's really not like what you see on the outside.

460
00:35:07,580 --> 00:35:09,180
For sure he's not.

461
00:35:10,480 --> 00:35:14,979
You'll never guess who the real evil one in our group is.

462
00:35:17,380 --> 00:35:19,180
Me?

463
00:35:19,180 --> 00:35:21,480
It's not me!

464
00:35:22,180 --> 00:35:25,279
- It's Sun Bo!
- Sun Bo?

465
00:35:25,279 --> 00:35:27,480
You didn't notice.

466
00:35:27,480 --> 00:35:30,179
That's right! I forgot how mean he got.

467
00:35:30,279 --> 00:35:32,379
He's the real king of emotions, okay?

468
00:35:32,380 --> 00:35:33,380
Please!

469
00:35:33,381 --> 00:35:35,380
Please. How could it be me?

470
00:35:52,580 --> 00:35:55,380
Do you think your parents would like me?

471
00:35:55,380 --> 00:35:57,080
Of course, they will.

472
00:35:58,913 --> 00:36:01,380
I wish they could have known you.

473
00:36:05,030 --> 00:36:06,879
Just wait, one day,

474
00:36:08,812 --> 00:36:10,980
we'll go to a place that's very close to the stars.

475
00:36:12,280 --> 00:36:15,313
Let them take a good look at us.

476
00:36:15,313 --> 00:36:19,580
You're talking about the Himalayan mountains.

477
00:36:20,520 --> 00:36:23,680
Himalayan mountains?

478
00:36:25,680 --> 00:36:28,313
I was thinking Jade mountain.

479
00:36:28,313 --> 00:36:31,379
If you want the Himalayan mountains,

480
00:36:31,380 --> 00:36:34,079
then sure. I promise you!

481
00:36:34,079 --> 00:36:35,780
I'll take you for sure.

482
00:37:50,180 --> 00:37:52,580
I'm so envious of them.

483
00:37:52,580 --> 00:37:54,580
They can live together.

484
00:37:55,813 --> 00:37:57,813
Unlike me.

485
00:37:57,813 --> 00:38:00,580
After a few days, I'll need to move to Tainan.

486
00:38:05,780 --> 00:38:08,279
Four years will pass by very quickly.

487
00:38:08,280 --> 00:38:12,080
Besides Tainan and Taipei are very close.

488
00:38:12,080 --> 00:38:13,980
Just a highspeed rail ticket away.

489
00:38:13,980 --> 00:38:16,480
Do you really know how to comfort someone?

490
00:38:16,480 --> 00:38:18,380
You even said that you like to be with someone all the time.

491
00:38:18,380 --> 00:38:20,213
It doesn't look like it to me.

492
00:38:47,280 --> 00:38:49,913
We still have a long future together, right?

493
00:38:49,913 --> 00:38:52,780
Four years will pass by very quickly.

494
00:38:52,780 --> 00:38:54,979
What do you mean, "four years will pass by very quickly?"

495
00:38:54,980 --> 00:38:57,280
Four years is 1,460 days.

496
00:38:57,280 --> 00:38:59,080
Do you even know your math?

497
00:39:03,030 --> 00:39:05,279
Emotionless person.

498
00:39:05,280 --> 00:39:07,780
Didn't we say we were going to be together forever?

499
00:39:11,280 --> 00:39:14,179
Consider these four years as an investment in our future.

500
00:39:14,180 --> 00:39:17,270
Don't think about anything else. Just study hard.

501
00:39:17,879 --> 00:39:21,829
As for me, I will work hard.

502
00:39:21,829 --> 00:39:23,579
I believe our future is going to be even better.

503
00:39:23,580 --> 00:39:24,980
Even happier.

504
00:39:24,980 --> 00:39:26,780
What do you say?

505
00:39:28,730 --> 00:39:31,680
We are already very happy.

506
00:39:33,380 --> 00:39:36,580
Okay, I understand.

507
00:39:36,580 --> 00:39:40,679
Then I'll study harder, so I'll make a lot of money later.

508
00:39:40,679 --> 00:39:43,080
So that you'll be all mine.

509
00:39:50,513 --> 00:39:52,179
What are you doing?

510
00:39:52,180 --> 00:39:54,679
Belong to you, so I'm sticking to you.

511
00:39:54,680 --> 00:39:56,780
Sticking to me?

512
00:40:03,380 --> 00:40:05,780
Didn't you say you'd stick to me?

513
00:40:06,913 --> 00:40:08,980
You don't love me at all.

514
00:40:54,880 --> 00:40:57,380
It's 11:00. Are we going to make it on time?

515
00:40:57,380 --> 00:40:59,380
11:00. It should be okay.

516
00:40:59,380 --> 00:41:01,912
I told my mom 11:30.

517
00:41:01,913 --> 00:41:05,480
But with her personality, it'll be past 12:00 before she arrives.

518
00:41:05,480 --> 00:41:07,979
It'll be fine, you'll see. We've prepared everything.

519
00:41:07,980 --> 00:41:10,780
All that's left is to stir-fry everything. Then all are ready.

520
00:41:12,113 --> 00:41:13,512
You said so.

521
00:41:13,513 --> 00:41:15,380
I'm sure.

522
00:41:25,880 --> 00:41:27,579
Taste this for me.

523
00:41:27,580 --> 00:41:29,779
Check to see if the onion pork soup is ready yet.

524
00:41:29,780 --> 00:41:31,413
Be careful.

525
00:41:33,313 --> 00:41:35,080
It's hot.

526
00:41:48,513 --> 00:41:50,680
It's so sweet; it's delicious!

527
00:41:51,480 --> 00:41:54,480
You're amazing!

528
00:41:55,713 --> 00:41:57,113
Kiss.

529
00:41:58,780 --> 00:42:00,680
Do you think Uncle and Auntie will like this?

530
00:42:00,680 --> 00:42:02,580
For sure they will.

531
00:42:05,380 --> 00:42:07,380
They like strong salty flavors more.

532
00:42:27,513 --> 00:42:31,312
When I got the cola just now, I left the salt on the shelf.

533
00:42:34,180 --> 00:42:36,479
Then I'll hurry up and get some. Watch the soup for me.

534
00:42:36,479 --> 00:42:37,980
Okay.

535
00:42:39,680 --> 00:42:41,480
Remember to bring the keys!

536
00:42:42,880 --> 00:42:45,080
Got them.

537
00:42:51,480 --> 00:42:53,780
So forgetful.

538
00:43:03,350 --> 00:43:05,313
This really is delicious.

539
00:43:42,580 --> 00:43:44,112
Hello?

540
00:43:44,113 --> 00:43:46,013
Wallet.

541
00:43:52,280 --> 00:43:55,679
Okay, walk back. I'll bring it to you.

542
00:43:55,680 --> 00:43:58,680
Okay, I'll head back now.

543
00:44:25,940 --> 00:44:31,460
♫ I still don’t understand why you left ♫

544
00:44:31,460 --> 00:44:37,360
♫ I still don’t understand why I’m waiting ♫

545
00:44:37,360 --> 00:44:43,260
♫ Waiting for who will remember their responsibility ♫

546
00:44:43,260 --> 00:44:48,960
♫ I’m left at the original place wandering around alone ♫

547
00:44:48,960 --> 00:44:54,340
♫ When the blue sky and white clouds disappear ♫

548
00:44:54,340 --> 00:44:59,770
♫ When you take away the yellow sneakers and the red sweater ♫

549
00:44:59,770 --> 00:45:05,150
♫ When all the colors are gone along with you ♫

550
00:45:05,150 --> 00:45:11,840
♫ Only transparent tears that unceasingly fall accompany me ♫

551
00:45:11,840 --> 00:45:17,300
♫ I still don’t understand why you left ♫

552
00:45:17,300 --> 00:45:23,320
♫ I still don’t understand why I’m waiting ♫

553
00:45:23,320 --> 00:45:29,040
♫ Waiting for who will remember their responsibility ♫

554
00:45:29,040 --> 00:45:33,470
♫ I’m left at the original place wandering around alone ♫

555
00:45:33,470 --> 00:45:38,840
♫ When one story becomes two regrets ♫

556
00:45:38,840 --> 00:45:45,130
♫ Letting two hearts run towards two different futures ♫

557
00:45:45,130 --> 00:45:50,760
♫ All those that can’t be forgotten can only become regrets ♫

558
00:45:50,760 --> 00:45:57,880
♫ But I still can’t understand why the tears won’t stop ♫
