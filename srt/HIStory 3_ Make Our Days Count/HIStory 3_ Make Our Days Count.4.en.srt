[HIStory 3: Make Our Days Count]
[Episode 4]

13
00:01:53,301 --> 00:01:55,533
How come you're here again?

14
00:01:58,567 --> 00:02:01,367
You've been acting pretty strange lately.

15
00:02:02,267 --> 00:02:03,867
At first, I didn't think it was anything,

16
00:02:03,868 --> 00:02:08,267
but seeing you here now seems like something really is wrong.

17
00:02:17,834 --> 00:02:22,666
Xiang Yongching, am I someone that seems very arrogant?

18
00:02:22,666 --> 00:02:24,767
You're realizing that just now?

19
00:02:33,701 --> 00:02:37,066
Dad always uses the phrase "the young man isn't worthy to be taught" when scolding me.

20
00:02:37,066 --> 00:02:40,800
The teachers at school hate it when I'm uncontrollable.

21
00:02:40,801 --> 00:02:42,667
Even Sun Bo...

22
00:02:43,768 --> 00:02:47,833
thinks I do whatever I want whenever I want and never considers other people's feelings.

23
00:02:50,167 --> 00:02:53,001
So am I really such a bad person?

24
00:02:59,300 --> 00:03:01,966
Actually, you're not that bad a person.

25
00:03:01,967 --> 00:03:05,633
Even though you are cocky sometimes and self-righteous.

26
00:03:12,401 --> 00:03:17,500
But, do you know, you have a really huge thing that you have

27
00:03:17,500 --> 00:03:19,667
which no other person has?

28
00:03:21,267 --> 00:03:24,966
It's that you are very, very kind-hearted.

29
00:03:26,067 --> 00:03:27,466
Am I?

30
00:03:27,467 --> 00:03:29,166
Of course, you are.

31
00:03:29,167 --> 00:03:31,133
You're so loyal to your friends.

32
00:03:31,134 --> 00:03:33,767
That's why they all like you so much.

33
00:03:33,768 --> 00:03:36,700
Also, you really are very good to your little sister.

34
00:03:36,701 --> 00:03:38,733
When I'm at school, I can always brag about

35
00:03:38,734 --> 00:03:41,900
h.ow I have a big brother that really takes care of me

36
00:03:43,067 --> 00:03:45,133
Really?

37
00:03:45,134 --> 00:03:48,400
Remember the last time when you were just trying to encourage me

38
00:03:48,400 --> 00:03:51,166
and you ended up getting the second-highest mark in the whole school?

39
00:03:51,167 --> 00:03:54,399
And that time at the small fishing port, everyone was yelling at you

40
00:03:54,399 --> 00:03:56,999
all because you were trying to protect me?

41
00:03:57,000 --> 00:04:00,934
I thought you were so cool, my hero.

42
00:04:02,834 --> 00:04:04,234
Really?

43
00:04:11,033 --> 00:04:15,099
So you're already pretty good.

44
00:04:15,099 --> 00:04:18,399
Just that sometimes you need to be a bit more considerate, a bit more serious.

45
00:04:18,399 --> 00:04:20,400
Then, you'll be perfect.

46
00:04:21,567 --> 00:04:25,466
Considerate and serious.

47
00:04:25,467 --> 00:04:27,566
So I'm–

48
00:04:27,567 --> 00:04:29,267
Xiang Yongching,

49
00:04:31,167 --> 00:04:32,500
you really are my sun.

50
00:04:32,501 --> 00:04:34,434
Come on! Let's go home.

51
00:04:40,900 --> 00:04:43,267
You're amazing.

52
00:05:01,234 --> 00:05:03,700
Then give me a chance.

53
00:05:04,800 --> 00:05:07,267
I really do want to be with you.

54
00:05:29,933 --> 00:05:32,033
I missed you so much.

55
00:05:37,567 --> 00:05:39,280
Sorry.

56
00:05:40,134 --> 00:05:42,700
You remember to be sorry.

57
00:05:42,701 --> 00:05:44,800
Then, if you want me to forgive you,

58
00:05:44,801 --> 00:05:48,534
t.hen, this and this

59
00:05:48,534 --> 00:05:52,133
I'm very serious in wanting to say sorry to you. That's why...

60
00:05:53,033 --> 00:05:57,432
I asked you out today. I want to clear things up.

61
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:01,001
What are you trying to say?

62
00:06:04,501 --> 00:06:08,301
I can't continue to call you "baby" anymore, Shiyu.

63
00:06:13,601 --> 00:06:15,734
Then just call me "babe."

64
00:06:20,401 --> 00:06:22,467
We can't be together anymore.

65
00:06:28,834 --> 00:06:30,734
We really can't?

66
00:06:35,868 --> 00:06:38,767
Why can't we?

67
00:06:38,768 --> 00:06:42,899
Xiang Haoting, I don't want to.

68
00:06:50,868 --> 00:06:53,433
Why can't we?

69
00:06:58,100 --> 00:07:01,133
Just give me another chance.

70
00:07:01,133 --> 00:07:04,233
What am I doing wrong? Just tell me.

71
00:07:06,234 --> 00:07:08,434
Because I like someone else.

72
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:03,768
Yu Shigu!

73
00:08:24,367 --> 00:08:26,033
Did you tell him?

74
00:08:30,834 --> 00:08:33,167
Yup, and you?

75
00:08:35,367 --> 00:08:37,067
Me, too.

76
00:08:53,734 --> 00:08:55,267
So?

77
00:09:04,900 --> 00:09:06,867
I got the death sentence.

78
00:09:15,734 --> 00:09:17,467
You're giving up?

79
00:09:23,067 --> 00:09:25,290
He said I am too young.

80
00:09:25,967 --> 00:09:28,333
I can't just all of a sudden grow up.

81
00:09:29,768 --> 00:09:32,834
He also said there's no forever.

82
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:37,368
I really want to know where I can buy it.

83
00:09:38,834 --> 00:09:42,833
I wanted to say, "Can I keep harassing you?"

84
00:09:44,601 --> 00:09:46,867
But I can't even fall in love.

85
00:09:47,900 --> 00:09:52,034
So, he would probably feel even worse if I kept harassing him.

86
00:09:52,100 --> 00:09:53,768
I don't want that.

87
00:09:56,734 --> 00:09:58,620
To love someone...

88
00:09:59,401 --> 00:10:03,234
is not to let them cry or to let them feel bad.

89
00:10:03,234 --> 00:10:05,070
To love someone...

90
00:10:05,801 --> 00:10:07,901
is to let them be happy.

91
00:10:23,267 --> 00:10:25,434
Are you writing a song?

92
00:10:38,067 --> 00:10:39,734
I'll go.

93
00:10:41,434 --> 00:10:42,801
Go where?

94
00:10:49,067 --> 00:10:50,901
To help you.

95
00:10:57,868 --> 00:10:59,868
This is your receipt and your sixty dollars change.

96
00:10:59,868 --> 00:11:00,899
Thank you.

97
00:11:00,900 --> 00:11:02,500
And your hot soybean milk.

98
00:11:02,500 --> 00:11:03,867
- Thank you.
- Be careful it's hot.

99
00:11:03,868 --> 00:11:06,234
- Hi, Brother Chigang.
- Hi, you're here.

100
00:11:06,234 --> 00:11:08,299
I've already prepared it for you.

101
00:11:08,300 --> 00:11:10,233
Okay. Thanks, bye-bye.

102
00:11:10,233 --> 00:11:11,400
Bye-bye.

103
00:11:11,401 --> 00:11:13,334
What can I get for you?

104
00:11:18,601 --> 00:11:20,667
What would you like?

105
00:11:21,367 --> 00:11:23,320
He's very serious.

106
00:11:23,967 --> 00:11:25,700
He's very naïve.

107
00:11:25,701 --> 00:11:27,701
And he's a virgin.

108
00:11:28,701 --> 00:11:30,066
And who are you?

109
00:11:30,067 --> 00:11:32,600
I'm a brother to Sun Boxiang.

110
00:11:43,734 --> 00:11:45,533
What do you guys want?

111
00:11:45,534 --> 00:11:48,567
I told him that I recently started to like a guy.

112
00:11:48,567 --> 00:11:51,299
He told me to like someone,

113
00:11:51,299 --> 00:11:53,533
you must be wholehearted and sincere in order to move the other person.

114
00:11:53,534 --> 00:11:56,433
Xiang Haoting, what are you talking about?

115
00:11:56,433 --> 00:11:58,933
He will definitely give everything

116
00:11:58,933 --> 00:12:00,967
and his first time to the person he loves the most.

117
00:12:00,967 --> 00:12:01,967
That person is you.

118
00:12:01,968 --> 00:12:03,633
You, shut up right now!

119
00:12:03,634 --> 00:12:06,000
Brother Chigang, I'm sorry! I'll get rid of him right away.

120
00:12:07,467 --> 00:12:08,600
Let me finish talking.

121
00:12:08,601 --> 00:12:09,800
- Just stop talking.
- You lost the feeling of security.

122
00:12:09,800 --> 00:12:11,534
- What's feeling secure?
- That's enough.
- Is it more important than love?

123
00:12:11,534 --> 00:12:13,668
- Are you a man?
- You just stop talking. That's enough!

124
00:12:13,668 --> 00:12:14,800
You just know how to use age to brush him off.

125
00:12:14,801 --> 00:12:16,899
Enough!

126
00:12:16,900 --> 00:12:18,900
What does this have to do with you?

127
00:12:23,467 --> 00:12:25,200
You guys just calm down.

128
00:12:25,200 --> 00:12:26,867
I have customers here.

129
00:12:26,868 --> 00:12:29,599
If you're too afraid to say it, I'll say it for you. Your business is my business.

130
00:12:29,599 --> 00:12:32,634
I told you all of this stuff not to have you come here to tell him.

131
00:12:32,634 --> 00:12:35,667
Why? You've done so much for him! Why don't you want him to know?

132
00:12:35,667 --> 00:12:37,700
What does it matter? What does it matter?!

133
00:12:37,701 --> 00:12:40,832
I don't want to see you suffer anymore, so depressed.

134
00:12:43,033 --> 00:12:44,666
Enough!

135
00:12:44,667 --> 00:12:47,499
I'm telling you! This is my place of work.

136
00:12:47,499 --> 00:12:49,166
Do the two of you understand respect?

137
00:12:49,167 --> 00:12:51,160
What the hell?!

138
00:12:51,967 --> 00:12:54,533
Ridiculous the both of you.

139
00:12:58,834 --> 00:13:00,667
Come outside with me.

140
00:13:30,167 --> 00:13:32,833
You really want to be with me?

141
00:13:32,834 --> 00:13:34,834
Have you been in love before?

142
00:13:35,601 --> 00:13:39,166
No. You're the first.

143
00:13:39,166 --> 00:13:41,166
Then, how can you fall in love with me?

144
00:13:41,167 --> 00:13:42,932
Do you understand me?

145
00:13:42,933 --> 00:13:45,166
Do you know what I like to eat?

146
00:13:45,167 --> 00:13:47,500
Do you know what to do so that I'd be happy every day?

147
00:13:47,500 --> 00:13:51,133
Do you know that when I'm depressed I need you to come and be with me at the first chance you get?

148
00:13:51,133 --> 00:13:53,168
You don't know anything.

149
00:13:55,334 --> 00:13:57,400
I've had three boyfriends.

150
00:13:57,401 --> 00:14:00,466
Each one, I had given my all to love them.

151
00:14:00,467 --> 00:14:02,634
But what did I get at the end?

152
00:14:04,301 --> 00:14:06,933
They said that I gave them too much pressure.

153
00:14:06,934 --> 00:14:08,920
No freedom.

154
00:14:09,868 --> 00:14:13,566
No matter how much I tried, giving them my all,

155
00:14:15,501 --> 00:14:17,934
they all chose to leave me.

156
00:14:18,933 --> 00:14:22,932
Yes, I'm selfish.

157
00:14:22,932 --> 00:14:25,433
I'm self-righteous.

158
00:14:25,434 --> 00:14:27,099
So I don't want to love anymore, right now.

159
00:14:27,100 --> 00:14:28,967
Do you understand?

160
00:14:33,634 --> 00:14:36,120
You're telling me all of this to make me give up on you?

161
00:14:36,701 --> 00:14:38,900
So have you given up?

162
00:15:09,030 --> 00:15:14,560
♫ This world has too many regrets, ♫

163
00:15:14,560 --> 00:15:17,360
♫ has too many difficulties ♫

164
00:15:17,360 --> 00:15:21,000

166

I don't know how to make you happy every day.

167
00:15:25,933 --> 00:15:30,733
I also don't know what to do when you get angry.

If you don't want to love anymore, that's fine.

Believe in me this one time.

What did you want to tell me?

201
00:18:54,434 --> 00:18:56,900
I wanted to explain things to you.

202
00:18:59,601 --> 00:19:02,500
I've been trying to find a time to apologize to you.

203

I really wasn't hassling you.

204
00:19:06,167 --> 00:19:08,133
After I messed up your exam,

205

I've regretted it and been feeling really guilty.

That's why I've been following you.

I just wanted to really apologize to you,

208
00:19:15,768 --> 00:19:18,267
and I broke up with Li Shiyu.

209
00:19:20,200 --> 00:19:24,100
What happened at the bar, I really didn't mean to mess up your job there either.

210
00:19:24,100 --> 00:19:26,400
It's because, that place...

How do you want to get back at him?

241
00:22:15,933 --> 00:22:20,066
He's not even afraid of the teachers and doesn't listen to his parents,

242
00:22:20,066 --> 00:22:22,000
and doesn't care about me.

I don't want to just let it go.

Then, what do you want to do?

246
00:22:34,234 --> 00:22:37,700

00:22:37,700 --> 00:22:40,167
to be my boyfriend.

248
00:22:40,167 --> 00:22:42,833
I want to really piss Xiang Haoting off.

That's it?

250
00:22:44,900 --> 00:22:47,299
You have given so much in this past half-year, been so good to him,

251
00:22:47,300 --> 00:22:49,800

00:25:11,467 --> 00:25:14,000
- Quick. Look!
- Why is he here?

261
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:15,267
A-hao, what are you doing here?

262

265

I don't know either! Don't ask me!

Right.

276
00:25:49,235 --> 00:25:50,466
What the heck's going on?

277
00:25:50,467 --> 00:25:51,434
Leaning up so close.

278
00:25:51,434 --> 00:25:52,566
- That's nothing.
 - Coming to look for him.

279
00:25:52,567 --> 00:25:55,134
- Also, with the lunchboxes.
- When were they so close?

280
00:25:55,134 --> 00:25:58,633
- What's happening, what's going on now?
- They were so close, too!

281
00:26:07,900 --> 00:26:09,683
What is it that you want?

282
00:26:09,684 --> 00:26:12,783
Last time I saw you eating braised pork ribs like you were eating poop.

283
00:26:12,783 --> 00:26:14,851
So I got you something else today.

284
00:26:16,017 --> 00:26:17,551
Do you like it?

285
00:26:21,484 --> 00:26:24,816
If you don't like it, it's okay, just tell me.

286
00:26:24,816 --> 00:26:26,116
I don't like it.

287
00:26:26,117 --> 00:26:29,084
It's okay if you don't eat it.

288
00:26:29,084 --> 00:26:30,516
But I want to let you know,

289
00:26:30,517 --> 00:26:32,851
I'm not doing this out of guilt.

290
00:26:35,150 --> 00:26:37,450
I'm chasing after you now.

291
00:26:38,451 --> 00:26:39,583
Let go of me!

292
00:26:39,584 --> 00:26:42,384
I like you! I don't want to see you hungry!

293
00:26:42,384 --> 00:26:45,950
It breaks my heart to see you hungry.

294
00:26:45,950 --> 00:26:47,683
It makes me feel bad.

295
00:26:47,684 --> 00:26:51,084
Thanks, but it's okay.

296
00:26:51,084 --> 00:26:53,251
Please!

297
00:26:55,184 --> 00:26:56,656
We're students.

298
00:26:56,657 --> 00:26:59,050
We'll be taking exams in a few months; we're going to battle.

299
00:26:59,050 --> 00:27:01,549
If you don't eat properly, take care of yourself properly.

300
00:27:01,551 --> 00:27:04,582
Then when the time comes, you'll fall over before the exams. Then what?

301
00:27:07,050 --> 00:27:08,784
Also...

302
00:27:10,384 --> 00:27:12,884
You go out at midnight to work your part-time job.

303
00:27:14,584 --> 00:27:16,017
Eat.

304
00:27:17,217 --> 00:27:19,383
I don't like taking advantage of people.

305
00:27:19,384 --> 00:27:22,049
I don't want people to pity me either.

306
00:27:22,050 --> 00:27:23,950
I'm not pitying you, I like you.

307
00:27:23,950 --> 00:27:24,883
I'm trying to give you a good impression of me.

308
00:27:24,884 --> 00:27:27,883
Because as long as you're happy, I will be happy, too.

309
00:27:27,883 --> 00:27:29,850
Then, I don't want you to be happy.

310
00:27:44,917 --> 00:27:46,183
What are you doing?

311
00:27:46,184 --> 00:27:47,949
How about like this?

312
00:27:47,950 --> 00:27:49,516
Like what?

313
00:27:49,517 --> 00:27:52,049
I'm not happy…

314
00:27:52,050 --> 00:27:53,740
Eat!

315
00:28:03,451 --> 00:28:07,116
You're laughing. You're laughing!

316
00:28:07,117 --> 00:28:09,250
YES, it was worth it!

317
00:28:11,684 --> 00:28:13,260
Eat the lunchbox.

318
00:28:14,083 --> 00:28:15,984
How can I eat with you grabbing like this?

319
00:28:15,984 --> 00:28:18,250
If I let go,

320
00:28:21,417 --> 00:28:23,584
you can't run away.

321
00:29:07,784 --> 00:29:10,550
What are you doing?

322
00:29:12,017 --> 00:29:15,617
Why are guys harder to please than girls?

323
00:29:16,850 --> 00:29:20,251
Mister, can you stop looking so happy while you complain?

324
00:29:20,251 --> 00:29:22,250
You have a split personality.

325
00:29:23,651 --> 00:29:25,882
Enough! Put your mouth back in its place!

326
00:29:25,883 --> 00:29:26,883
You're blinding me with your happy glow.

327
00:29:26,884 --> 00:29:28,483
You can't blame me.

328
00:29:28,484 --> 00:29:31,350
He finally finished the lunchbox that I got for him.

329
00:29:31,351 --> 00:29:35,517
Also, I noticed that he seemed to especially like eating carrots.

330
00:29:35,517 --> 00:29:38,350
He very tenderly picked out all the carrots,

331
00:29:38,351 --> 00:29:40,531
then when he finished everything else...

332
00:29:43,850 --> 00:29:45,982
You're really disgusting.

333
00:29:45,983 --> 00:29:49,384
He was eating his lunchbox and you just kept starring at him.

334
00:29:49,384 --> 00:29:51,016
What do you know anyway?

335
00:29:51,017 --> 00:29:53,016
This is called watching wholeheartedly.

336
00:29:53,017 --> 00:29:55,350
Truly listening and truly seeing.

337
00:29:56,050 --> 00:29:58,218
True feelings.

338
00:29:58,818 --> 00:30:00,750
That's gross.

339
00:30:04,818 --> 00:30:07,183
Do you really like guys?

340
00:30:07,184 --> 00:30:08,851
Not really.

341
00:30:10,384 --> 00:30:12,516
I only like him.

342
00:30:12,517 --> 00:30:15,016
Yu Shigu is a guy.

343
00:30:15,017 --> 00:30:17,183
I don't know how to explain it to you.

344
00:30:17,184 --> 00:30:20,083
Anyway, right now, I really like him.

345
00:30:20,084 --> 00:30:22,350
I just want to be with him.

346
00:30:22,351 --> 00:30:24,050
I just want him.

347
00:30:25,150 --> 00:30:27,584
You always say that.

348
00:30:36,017 --> 00:30:40,016
Didn't you say, when he was at your uncle's place--

349
00:30:40,016 --> 00:30:41,510
Big Brother!

350
00:30:41,510 --> 00:30:43,785
Big Brother, Big Brother...

351
00:30:43,785 --> 00:30:46,650
- Didn't he work part-time at your big brother's place?
- Yeah.

352
00:30:46,650 --> 00:30:48,982
Then go and try and find out for me what he likes,

353
00:30:48,982 --> 00:30:50,351
or where he...

354
00:30:50,351 --> 00:30:51,730
usually goes.

355
00:30:51,730 --> 00:30:53,550
I don't want to.

356
00:30:53,551 --> 00:30:55,983
- Why?
- I don't want to.

357
00:30:55,983 --> 00:30:57,984
- Got my back or not?
- It's not about watching your back or not.

358
00:30:57,984 --> 00:30:59,283
He was really good friends with Brother Chigang.

359
00:30:59,284 --> 00:31:01,949
I once saw Brother Chigang touch his head.

360
00:31:01,950 --> 00:31:03,016
Definitely, no way.

361
00:31:03,017 --> 00:31:04,083
Why did he touch his head?

362
00:31:04,084 --> 00:31:04,950
How do I know?

363
00:31:04,951 --> 00:31:06,316
I even went to confront him the other day to ask him.

364
00:31:06,317 --> 00:31:07,683
He would rather die than admit it.

365
00:31:07,684 --> 00:31:08,750
Who did you go confront?

366
00:31:08,751 --> 00:31:12,117
- Annoying Gu. Who else?
- When?

367
00:31:12,117 --> 00:31:15,084
I don't know. Before the mid-term exams.

368
00:31:19,451 --> 00:31:23,117
So you knew really early on that he was working there?

369
00:31:28,084 --> 00:31:30,283
- What do you mean?
- "What do you mean?"

370
00:31:30,284 --> 00:31:31,550
What did you say just now?

371
00:31:31,551 --> 00:31:32,882
I wasn't listening at all.

372
00:31:32,883 --> 00:31:33,718
Really?

373
00:31:33,719 --> 00:31:36,216
What do you mean? What do you mean?

374
00:31:36,217 --> 00:31:38,949
I'll give you one more chance, Sun Boxiang!

375
00:31:38,949 --> 00:31:40,116
I forgot! I forgot!

376
00:31:40,117 --> 00:31:41,350
- Sorry!
- Betraying your brother!

377
00:31:41,351 --> 00:31:42,717
I forgot!

378
00:31:42,718 --> 00:31:44,418
Move!

379
00:32:01,784 --> 00:32:03,083
Why does borrowing a book take so long?

380
00:32:03,084 --> 00:32:05,216
How long is it going to take? It's night already!

381
00:32:05,217 --> 00:32:07,618
- Did you get them?
- Got them.

382
00:32:14,384 --> 00:32:15,750
You know...

383
00:32:15,751 --> 00:32:17,949
borrowing these is scarier than borrowing porn.

384
00:32:17,950 --> 00:32:21,617
That girl kept watching me and kept smiling at me.

385
00:32:21,617 --> 00:32:22,750
Did you read them already?

386
00:32:22,751 --> 00:32:24,717
Not yet.

387
00:32:24,718 --> 00:32:26,483
I don't have the guts to read them all by myself.

388
00:32:26,484 --> 00:32:28,616
This type of material, it's better to read together.

389
00:32:28,617 --> 00:32:30,283
You're overexaggerating.

390
00:32:30,284 --> 00:32:32,016
If you want to read together, then let's read.

391
00:32:32,017 --> 00:32:34,217
Let's read mine first.

392
00:32:35,917 --> 00:32:37,083
What is it? I almost went in my pants.

393
00:32:37,084 --> 00:32:38,350
But by just reading these BL comics,

394
00:32:38,351 --> 00:32:40,551
will it really help us understand A-xiang better?

395
00:32:41,718 --> 00:32:44,282
Of course. Do it for our brother.

396
00:32:44,282 --> 00:32:45,616
Do it for our friendship.

397
00:32:45,617 --> 00:32:47,783
We must try and understand him better.

398
00:32:47,784 --> 00:32:49,350
If we accidentally say something wrong,

399
00:32:49,351 --> 00:32:50,583
or we run out of things to talk about,

400
00:32:50,584 --> 00:32:52,350
Old Sun will leave us for sure.

401
00:32:52,351 --> 00:32:54,283
Right.

402
00:32:54,284 --> 00:32:56,820
- For our brother.
- For our brother.

403
00:32:56,820 --> 00:32:58,650
For our brother.

404
00:32:59,551 --> 00:33:00,983
Start reading.

405
00:33:16,284 --> 00:33:17,117
It's so big.

406
00:33:17,118 --> 00:33:18,849
What's big?

407
00:33:18,850 --> 00:33:20,016
Fingers are big.

408
00:33:20,017 --> 00:33:23,316
- What are you thinking about?
- Scared me.

409
00:33:39,718 --> 00:33:42,149
Anyway, I just forgot to tell him.

410
00:33:42,150 --> 00:33:44,750
He just pulled me over and started kicking me.

411
00:33:49,117 --> 00:33:52,216
I told you that I was beat up today and you have no reaction at all?

412
00:33:53,651 --> 00:33:55,817
I have no love anymore.

413
00:33:55,818 --> 00:33:57,817
It's all a lie.

414
00:33:57,818 --> 00:33:59,350
My heart.

415
00:33:59,351 --> 00:34:01,651
So what do you want me to do now?

416
00:34:06,451 --> 00:34:09,284
Didn't we agree to keep our distance?

417
00:34:10,384 --> 00:34:12,551
What's the big deal?

418
00:34:17,117 --> 00:34:19,083
So, are you going to help Xiang Haoting?

419
00:34:19,084 --> 00:34:20,216
Help with what?

420
00:34:20,217 --> 00:34:22,616
I just told you five minutes ago.

421
00:34:22,617 --> 00:34:24,590
Weren't you listening?

422
00:34:24,590 --> 00:34:25,910
What?

423
00:34:25,917 --> 00:34:28,750
He wants to court Yu Shigu from your shop.

424
00:34:28,751 --> 00:34:30,550
Little Gu?

425
00:34:30,551 --> 00:34:32,450
You know each other?

426
00:34:32,451 --> 00:34:34,316
I guess so.

427
00:34:34,317 --> 00:34:35,883
What about it?

428
00:34:41,950 --> 00:34:44,051
You don't need to wait for me.

429
00:34:44,983 --> 00:34:46,116
No way.

430
00:34:46,117 --> 00:34:47,950
You going home alone is dangerous.

431
00:34:47,950 --> 00:34:49,817
I've been doing it for the past two and a half years.

432
00:34:49,818 --> 00:34:51,283
You can't let your guard down.

433
00:34:51,284 --> 00:34:53,016
If bad guys do take you away, then what?

434
00:34:53,017 --> 00:34:54,951
I'm a guy.

435
00:34:54,951 --> 00:34:59,816
So? You think those cases on TV don't include guys?

436
00:34:59,816 --> 00:35:02,316
You're paranoid.

437
00:35:02,317 --> 00:35:05,483
You the one that's paranoid. I'm helping you.

438
00:35:05,483 --> 00:35:07,217
Not necessary.

439
00:35:12,617 --> 00:35:14,016
You--

440
00:35:14,017 --> 00:35:15,684
What are you doing?

441
00:35:16,617 --> 00:35:20,183
I'm telling you! Is it me that's paranoid,

442
00:35:20,183 --> 00:35:22,951
or is it you that needs to be more careful?

443
00:35:33,718 --> 00:35:36,850
It hurts. Hurts. Hurts!

444
00:35:44,584 --> 00:35:46,049
Got you!

445
00:35:46,050 --> 00:35:48,317
And you said you didn't need me.

446
00:35:49,451 --> 00:35:51,550
What are you trying to do?

447
00:35:55,084 --> 00:35:57,417
Right now, I'm a bad guy.

448
00:35:59,651 --> 00:36:03,151
You can scream your lungs out and no one will hear you.

449
00:36:03,883 --> 00:36:05,616
Fine, I need it.

450
00:36:05,617 --> 00:36:07,340
I need it.

451
00:36:07,917 --> 00:36:09,183
What do you need?

452
00:36:09,184 --> 00:36:10,717
I need you to wait for me.

453
00:36:10,718 --> 00:36:11,916
And then?

454
00:36:11,917 --> 00:36:14,149
And then walk me home.

455
00:36:14,150 --> 00:36:17,982
- Also?
- Also...

456
00:36:19,351 --> 00:36:21,284
Also, what?

457
00:36:26,684 --> 00:36:29,184
Hurry up and like me.

458
00:36:47,117 --> 00:36:48,350
Chun-chun.

459
00:36:48,351 --> 00:36:51,350
Show off. Show off!

460
00:36:53,983 --> 00:36:56,317
Air ball!

461
00:36:56,317 --> 00:36:57,750
No need to go back to the line.

462
00:36:57,751 --> 00:36:59,719
Why does air ball need to get back to the line? Are you for real?

463
00:36:59,719 --> 00:37:01,450
Again.

464
00:37:06,883 --> 00:37:07,818
Pass!

465
00:37:07,819 --> 00:37:09,317
I'm free!

466
00:37:11,184 --> 00:37:14,383
- Little cabbage.
- Little cabbage!

467
00:37:14,384 --> 00:37:16,917
What the… Do you know how to play?

468
00:37:25,651 --> 00:37:27,350
So hot!

469
00:37:27,351 --> 00:37:29,717
So thirsty!

470
00:37:29,718 --> 00:37:30,882
Want to go get something to drink?

471
00:37:30,883 --> 00:37:32,284
- Let's go.
- Sure.

472
00:37:32,284 --> 00:37:34,184
Let's go, my treat.

473
00:37:35,651 --> 00:37:37,517
You guys are going to buy drinks, then just the two of you go.

474
00:37:37,517 --> 00:37:38,982
Why ask Sun Bo to go with you?

475
00:37:38,983 --> 00:37:40,882
That leaves the three of us. How can we keep playing?

476
00:37:40,883 --> 00:37:42,917
Sun Bo, come back.

477
00:37:44,150 --> 00:37:46,116
Wait!

478
00:37:46,117 --> 00:37:48,949
A-hao, how about if you go get them for us?

479
00:37:48,950 --> 00:37:50,049
I'll give you delivery fee.

480
00:37:50,050 --> 00:37:51,949
That's right! Didn't you want to buy a Switch?

481
00:37:51,950 --> 00:37:53,117
And haven't bought it yet?

482
00:37:53,117 --> 00:37:56,850
Asking me to buy drinks for you and giving me delivery fee on top, too.

483
00:37:56,850 --> 00:37:58,783
No wonder we're brothers.

484
00:37:58,784 --> 00:38:00,149
- Brother.
- It's nothing.

485
00:38:00,150 --> 00:38:02,651
Hurry up and go buy them.

486
00:38:02,651 --> 00:38:04,384
The two of you better not think that I didn't notice.

487
00:38:04,384 --> 00:38:05,916
You guys kept winking at each other all day.

488
00:38:05,917 --> 00:38:07,483
Winking back and forth.

489
00:38:07,484 --> 00:38:09,183
Speak!

490
00:38:09,184 --> 00:38:11,484
What do you want with Sun Bo?

491
00:38:12,417 --> 00:38:15,350
Just...

492
00:38:15,351 --> 00:38:19,650
Fine. We wanted to tell A-xiang that we understand him.

493
00:38:20,751 --> 00:38:22,550
Understand what?

494
00:38:24,451 --> 00:38:27,383
Don't you like...

495
00:38:29,651 --> 00:38:31,083
Like?

496
00:38:31,084 --> 00:38:33,451
You know, that...

497
00:38:34,084 --> 00:38:34,818
What?

498
00:38:34,819 --> 00:38:36,484
Say it.

499
00:38:39,484 --> 00:38:41,850
To be with guys like this.

500
00:38:48,318 --> 00:38:51,616
Oh, that's what they're trying to say.

501
00:38:51,617 --> 00:38:53,717
What?

502
00:38:53,718 --> 00:38:57,349
What we wanted to say is that even if you like guys,

503
00:38:57,349 --> 00:38:59,183
we are still brothers.

504
00:39:00,444 --> 00:39:01,982
Actually, we've already read some BL comics.

505
00:39:01,983 --> 00:39:04,583
It's just we don't really understand that world.

506
00:39:04,584 --> 00:39:06,216
If we say something wrong in the future,

507
00:39:06,217 --> 00:39:08,116
please don't take offense.

508
00:39:08,117 --> 00:39:09,616
Yeah, just say it.

509
00:39:09,617 --> 00:39:11,216
You're free to love whomever you like.

510
00:39:11,217 --> 00:39:16,051
- No matter what happens, we're always brothers.
- Brothers.

511
00:39:16,051 --> 00:39:18,150
I don't have a glass heart.

512
00:39:19,217 --> 00:39:20,050
I second that.

513
00:39:20,050 --> 00:39:21,883
That's the A-hao we know, he has our back.

514
00:39:21,884 --> 00:39:23,283
That's a given.

515
00:39:23,284 --> 00:39:25,017
Me, too.

516
00:39:26,017 --> 00:39:27,249
What?

517
00:39:27,250 --> 00:39:29,117
Like guys.

518
00:39:35,517 --> 00:39:37,684
That's not possible. How can you guys not know?

519
00:39:37,684 --> 00:39:40,491
I've been courting someone and have been putting a lot of effort into it.

520
00:39:42,983 --> 00:39:45,450
Seems like they really didn't notice.

521
00:39:47,050 --> 00:39:49,084
None of you even guessed it?

522
00:39:57,818 --> 00:40:01,383
A-en, don't die!

523
00:40:01,384 --> 00:40:03,184
I'm fine.

524
00:40:11,085 --> 00:40:15,284
What are we learning today?

525
00:40:15,284 --> 00:40:16,516
Let's go

526
00:40:16,517 --> 00:40:17,583
Hurry up! Let's go!

527
00:40:17,584 --> 00:40:19,184
Idiot.

528
00:40:24,351 --> 00:40:26,284
What are you doing here today?

529
00:40:28,950 --> 00:40:30,783
I'm here to see her.

530
00:40:30,784 --> 00:40:32,616
Me?

531
00:40:32,617 --> 00:40:35,217
I don't know.

532
00:40:38,990 --> 00:40:41,720
If it's about Shiyu's matter...

533
00:40:44,990 --> 00:40:47,810
I won't help you.

534
00:40:47,818 --> 00:40:50,017
What are you doing?

535
00:40:53,317 --> 00:40:54,882
You've been strange all day.

536
00:40:54,883 --> 00:40:56,717
What do you want?

537
00:40:56,718 --> 00:40:59,584
You have a lot of Yu Shigu's pictures?

538
00:40:59,584 --> 00:41:01,683
How did you know?

539
00:41:01,684 --> 00:41:04,684
Photos. Photos of Yu Shigu.

540
00:41:04,684 --> 00:41:07,717
Wait! I know that you have your differences with Yu Baby.

541
00:41:07,717 --> 00:41:09,550
I would never betray him.

542
00:41:09,551 --> 00:41:12,149
You're misunderstanding.

543
00:41:12,150 --> 00:41:15,916
Right now, we are brothers.

544
00:41:15,916 --> 00:41:18,149
That's not possible.

545
00:41:18,150 --> 00:41:21,016
Nothing is impossible.

546
00:41:21,017 --> 00:41:23,584
I don't believe you.

547
00:41:23,584 --> 00:41:25,683
- If not, let's make a trade.
- What are we going to exchange?

548
00:41:25,683 --> 00:41:27,417
The photos.

549
00:41:30,484 --> 00:41:33,350
Why do you have Yu Shigu's photos?

550
00:41:33,350 --> 00:41:34,616
Of course, I have photos.

551
00:41:34,617 --> 00:41:36,851
Right now, I study with him every day.

552
00:41:36,851 --> 00:41:38,416
Then every day after school, I walk home with him.

553
00:41:38,417 --> 00:41:40,651
It's impossible to not have any photos.

554
00:41:45,917 --> 00:41:48,617
You take really bad pictures.

555
00:41:49,284 --> 00:41:50,916
This was taken candidly.

556
00:41:50,917 --> 00:41:52,450
Mine were taken without him knowing.

557
00:41:52,450 --> 00:41:54,118
Yours are the same.

558
00:41:58,417 --> 00:42:00,351
You took these.

559
00:42:03,417 --> 00:42:05,716
This one. I want this one.

560
00:42:05,716 --> 00:42:07,382
- Wait! Wait!
- That one.

561
00:42:07,382 --> 00:42:10,184
I told you already before, I won't let you hurt my male god.

562
00:42:18,517 --> 00:42:21,184
I might as well tell you a secret then.

563
00:42:22,351 --> 00:42:24,450
What secret?

564
00:42:24,451 --> 00:42:30,316
I like Yu Shigu.

565
00:42:31,517 --> 00:42:35,017
Really? Are you for real? Really?

566
00:42:36,217 --> 00:42:37,949
Really! You're not joking with me are you?

567
00:42:37,950 --> 00:42:39,416
When? When? When?

568
00:42:39,417 --> 00:42:40,983
Right now.

569
00:42:42,917 --> 00:42:44,684
Really? You're not lying to me, right?

570
00:42:44,684 --> 00:42:46,249
Really.

571
00:42:46,250 --> 00:42:48,518
- What are you doing?
- Password.

572
00:42:55,651 --> 00:42:57,684
Am I getting a cold?

573
00:43:01,351 --> 00:43:02,783
Excuse me, let me bring the two of you some water first.

574
00:43:02,784 --> 00:43:04,583
Be careful.

575
00:43:04,584 --> 00:43:05,551
Thank you.

576
00:43:05,552 --> 00:43:08,149
How about some yogurt drinks today, okay?

577
00:43:08,150 --> 00:43:09,817
One yogurt drink, less ice.

578
00:43:09,818 --> 00:43:11,249
Yogurt drink.

579
00:43:11,250 --> 00:43:12,850
And you?

580
00:43:13,718 --> 00:43:15,817
Soda, thank you.

581
00:43:16,617 --> 00:43:17,882
Ask.

582
00:43:17,883 --> 00:43:20,316
Brother Chigang,

583
00:43:20,317 --> 00:43:22,583
Sun Bo said that you have something to tell us.

584
00:43:22,584 --> 00:43:26,383
We figured that it was perfect timing because we have something that we'd like to ask you.

585
00:43:26,383 --> 00:43:28,316
You want to ask about Little Gu, right?

586
00:43:28,317 --> 00:43:31,250
Yes, Yu Shigu.

587
00:43:31,250 --> 00:43:33,616
He works at your place,

588
00:43:33,617 --> 00:43:37,083
so we figured you must know him pretty well.

589
00:43:37,084 --> 00:43:38,050
I don't know.

590
00:43:38,051 --> 00:43:42,116
Things about him, I can't help you.

591
00:43:44,117 --> 00:43:46,016
I'm sorry.

592
00:43:46,017 --> 00:43:47,849
Sir, your yogurt drink.

593
00:43:47,850 --> 00:43:49,520
Thank you.

594
00:43:50,751 --> 00:43:52,351
- Your soda.
- Thanks.

595
00:43:52,351 --> 00:43:53,850
Enjoy.

596
00:43:56,818 --> 00:43:58,616
Do you know that Little Gu lives by himself?

597
00:43:58,617 --> 00:44:00,383
I know.

598
00:44:00,384 --> 00:44:03,716
Then, do you know why he works so hard in school for a scholarship?

599
00:44:03,716 --> 00:44:04,982
I don't know.

600
00:44:04,983 --> 00:44:08,084
Because Little Gu needs to take care of himself.

601
00:44:09,551 --> 00:44:11,617
His parents left him at a very young age.

602
00:44:11,617 --> 00:44:14,517
So, he grew up with his aunt since he was very young.

603
00:44:14,517 --> 00:44:17,417
But it seems that after aunt got married and had kids,

604
00:44:17,417 --> 00:44:19,717
he didn't want to trouble his aunt.

605
00:44:19,718 --> 00:44:21,450
So he works really hard to get a scholarship.

606
00:44:21,451 --> 00:44:24,084
Whatever the scholarship can't cover, he's worked here to make up for it.

607
00:44:24,084 --> 00:44:25,949
Why does he work so hard?

608
00:44:25,950 --> 00:44:28,049
Because he wants to get into a good university.

609
00:44:28,050 --> 00:44:31,750
Because only in a good school environment can he find a good job.

610
00:44:33,184 --> 00:44:36,950
So, that his future will become much better.

611
00:44:39,584 --> 00:44:42,350
I don't really understand what Brother Chigang is saying.

612
00:44:42,351 --> 00:44:44,583
He's not like you.

613
00:44:44,584 --> 00:44:46,249
He has ideals and ambition.

614
00:44:46,250 --> 00:44:49,016
He doesn't have time to play games with you.

615
00:44:49,017 --> 00:44:51,783
Why does he work himself so hard?

616
00:44:51,784 --> 00:44:54,350
He deserves a much better future life.

617
00:44:54,351 --> 00:44:58,183
So you showing up now will only destroy him.

618
00:45:00,117 --> 00:45:01,583
Don't.

619
00:45:01,584 --> 00:45:03,717
Little Gu's appearance is deceiving.

620
00:45:03,718 --> 00:45:05,483
He's very bashful and timid.

621
00:45:05,484 --> 00:45:06,949
He doesn't have a lot of friends.

622
00:45:06,950 --> 00:45:09,184
For sure, has never been in love.

623
00:45:10,184 --> 00:45:11,917
So?

624
00:45:12,617 --> 00:45:14,851
Please leave him alone.

625
00:45:17,950 --> 00:45:20,400
You came here today to tell me all this.

626
00:45:22,584 --> 00:45:24,185
You're not my dad and you're not my mom.

627
00:45:24,185 --> 00:45:25,949
What gives you the right to tell me all this?

628
00:45:25,950 --> 00:45:27,183
Xiang Haoting!

629
00:45:27,184 --> 00:45:29,383
It sounds like you're saying I'm useless, telling me to leave him alone,

630
00:45:29,383 --> 00:45:30,617
saying that I'm going to destroy him.

631
00:45:30,617 --> 00:45:32,083
What? What about you?

632
00:45:32,084 --> 00:45:34,000
Enough!

633
00:45:34,000 --> 00:45:36,483
Stop being so smug over there, okay? It's disgusting.

634
00:45:36,483 --> 00:45:37,616
Where are you going?

635
00:45:37,617 --> 00:45:39,957
Aren't you going out with my brother?

636
00:45:44,617 --> 00:45:46,950
I won't let you yell at Brother Chigang.

637
00:45:50,884 --> 00:45:52,950
What are you doing?

638
00:45:53,910 --> 00:46:01,250
Timing and Subtitles brought to you

639
00:46:01,940 --> 00:46:07,390
♫ I still don’t understand why you left ♫

640
00:46:07,390 --> 00:46:13,350
♫ I still don’t understand why I’m waiting ♫

641
00:46:13,350 --> 00:46:19,150
♫ Waiting for who will remember their responsibility ♫

642
00:46:19,150 --> 00:46:24,940
♫ I’m left at the original place wandering around alone ♫

643
00:46:24,940 --> 00:46:30,250
♫ When the blue sky and white clouds disappear ♫

644
00:46:30,250 --> 00:46:35,720
♫ When you take away the yellow sneakers and the red sweater ♫

645
00:46:35,720 --> 00:46:41,120
♫ When all the colors are gone along with you ♫

646
00:46:41,120 --> 00:46:47,760
♫ Only transparent tears that unceasingly fall accompany me ♫

647
00:46:47,760 --> 00:46:53,210
♫ I still don’t understand why you left ♫

648

♫ I still don’t understand why I’m waiting ♫

649
00:46:59,320 --> 00:47:05,030
♫ Waiting for who will remember their responsibility ♫

650
00:47:05,030 --> 00:47:09,450
♫ I’m left at the original place wandering around alone ♫

651
00:47:09,450 --> 00:47:14,760
♫ When one story becomes two regrets ♫

652
00:47:14,760 --> 00:47:21,120
♫ Letting two hearts run towards two different futures ♫

653
00:47:21,120 --> 00:47:26,580
♫ All those that can’t be forgotten can only become regrets ♫

654
00:47:26,580 --> 00:47:33,820
♫ But I still can’t understand why the tears won’t stop ♫
