Hey, lady,

67
00:04:47,920 --> 00:04:49,240
where are you going?

68
00:04:49,240 --> 00:04:50,040
What are you doing?

69
00:04:50,520 --> 00:04:51,480
Don't be nervous.

70
00:04:51,680 --> 00:04:54,320
Since your daughter
doesn't have a father,

71
00:04:54,320 --> 00:04:56,040
we might as well be her godfathers,

72
00:04:56,040 --> 00:04:57,640
so we can look after her.

73
00:04:58,200 --> 00:04:58,960
Come on, little girl.

74
00:04:59,320 --> 00:05:00,080
Don't come closer!

75
00:05:00,920 --> 00:05:02,800
If you don't want to die, get lost.

76
00:05:03,160 --> 00:05:04,040
Hey,

77
00:05:04,200 --> 00:05:05,880
little beggar,

78
00:05:05,880 --> 00:05:07,640
how dare you ruin my plan?

79
00:05:07,640 --> 00:05:08,360
Kill him!

80
00:05:25,280 --> 00:05:26,400
He has a knife!

81
00:05:26,720 --> 00:05:28,160
What's happening?

82
00:05:33,880 --> 00:05:35,320
Should we call the police?

83
00:05:35,920 --> 00:05:36,760
Hurry up.

84
00:05:37,320 --> 00:05:38,680
Don't come any closer!

85
00:05:38,880 --> 00:05:39,960
You little beggar,

86
00:05:39,960 --> 00:05:40,720
you...

87
00:05:41,240 --> 00:05:42,080
You just wait.

88
00:05:42,480 --> 00:05:43,760
Wait and see. Let's go!

89
00:06:03,600 --> 00:06:05,200
From now on, you can stay.

90
00:06:05,760 --> 00:06:07,560
With you as her brother,

91
00:06:07,560 --> 00:06:08,840
I'm much more at ease.

92
00:06:09,560 --> 00:06:10,200
Mom,

93
00:06:10,200 --> 00:06:13,080
shouldn't my brother have a name too?

94
00:06:17,280 --> 00:06:18,720
My name is Yunyue.

95
00:06:20,840 --> 00:06:23,000
Under the moon over a steep mountain.

96
00:06:24,880 --> 00:06:27,200
Let's call him Yunzheng.

97
00:06:27,200 --> 00:06:29,040
Fu Yunzheng.

98
00:06:31,560 --> 00:06:33,200
Fu Yunzheng.

99
00:06:35,840 --> 00:06:36,800
Mom,

100
00:06:36,800 --> 00:06:38,360
you're coughing blood again.

101
00:06:48,720 --> 00:06:49,760
Where did you get

102
00:06:49,760 --> 00:06:50,720
these medicines?

103
00:06:51,240 --> 00:06:52,640
I worked at the docks

104
00:06:52,640 --> 00:06:54,360
helping people load goods

105
00:06:54,360 --> 00:06:55,440
and earned some money.

106
00:06:55,960 --> 00:06:56,680
Tell me the truth.

107
00:07:01,920 --> 00:07:04,000
Those goods I helped load

108
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:05,840
were opium.

109
00:07:06,440 --> 00:07:07,480
You...

110
00:07:09,280 --> 00:07:11,560
- Mom.
- Mom.

111
00:07:14,720 --> 00:07:15,480
Kneel down!

112
00:07:16,240 --> 00:07:17,040
Mom,

113
00:07:17,040 --> 00:07:18,400
don't be angry.

114
00:07:18,400 --> 00:07:20,840
My brother is just worried
about your health.

115
00:07:25,560 --> 00:07:26,360
Stretch out your hand.

116
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:39,280
Do you know why I'm hitting you?

117
00:07:42,600 --> 00:07:44,160
If you still consider me your mom,

118
00:07:44,520 --> 00:07:45,640
swear to me.

119
00:07:46,280 --> 00:07:48,120
No matter how hard life gets,

120
00:07:48,120 --> 00:07:50,600
you'll never touch
those harmful things again.

121
00:07:50,960 --> 00:07:51,800
Otherwise,

122
00:07:52,200 --> 00:07:53,400
leave this house.

123
00:07:55,320 --> 00:07:57,720
I, Fu Yunzheng, swear.

124
00:08:29,440 --> 00:08:30,240
Yue,

125
00:08:31,560 --> 00:08:32,880
go boil some water.

126
00:08:32,880 --> 00:08:33,680
Alright.

127
00:08:46,840 --> 00:08:47,840
Yunzheng,

128
00:08:49,240 --> 00:08:50,240
Yue is still too young.

129
00:08:50,920 --> 00:08:52,360
She doesn't understand many things.

130
00:08:53,160 --> 00:08:54,120
But promise me,

131
00:08:54,120 --> 00:08:56,920
you'll always treat Yue as your sister.

132
00:08:57,560 --> 00:08:58,720
(Protect her,)

133
00:08:58,720 --> 00:08:59,560
(love her,)

134
00:09:01,080 --> 00:09:02,560
(and find her a good husband
in the future.)

135
00:09:20,240 --> 00:09:21,520
The beauty trap is indeed effective.

136
00:09:21,880 --> 00:09:22,880
Since you taught it to me,

137
00:09:22,880 --> 00:09:23,680
it worked.

138
00:09:24,200 --> 00:09:25,680
You're really reckless.

139
00:09:27,160 --> 00:09:29,040
If I had been an assassin just now,

140
00:09:29,040 --> 00:09:30,280
you would've died.

141
00:09:35,840 --> 00:09:37,240
I've made up my mind.

142
00:09:37,240 --> 00:09:39,440
I'll use Shen Xize to infiltrate
the Shen family.

143
00:09:39,800 --> 00:09:41,480
We'll work from the inside
and outside together

144
00:09:41,480 --> 00:09:42,320
to steal the ledger.

145
00:09:46,920 --> 00:09:47,920
I haven't agreed.

146
00:09:50,280 --> 00:09:51,480
I'm informing you,

147
00:09:51,720 --> 00:09:52,760
not negotiating.

148
00:09:53,240 --> 00:09:54,120
Besides,

149
00:09:54,120 --> 00:09:55,720
if you don't agree,

150
00:09:55,720 --> 00:09:56,880
I have other ways.

151
00:09:59,120 --> 00:10:00,040
We can cooperate,

152
00:10:00,960 --> 00:10:02,120
but there are three conditions.

153
00:10:02,520 --> 00:10:03,880
No hiding from each other,

154
00:10:03,880 --> 00:10:05,160
no acting alone,

155
00:10:05,680 --> 00:10:06,160
and

156
00:10:09,760 --> 00:10:10,720
no turning the fake act real.

157
00:10:11,680 --> 00:10:12,120
Agreed.

158
00:10:12,960 --> 00:10:14,080
But you must also follow through.

159
00:10:22,780 --> 00:10:26,460
(Train Station)

160
00:10:32,440 --> 00:10:33,200
Moli.

161
00:10:34,360 --> 00:10:35,120
Thank you.

162
00:10:36,280 --> 00:10:37,040
Moli,

163
00:10:37,640 --> 00:10:38,440
don't leave.

164
00:10:39,520 --> 00:10:41,640
I apologize on behalf
of the Shen family.

165
00:10:41,840 --> 00:10:42,720
Believe me,

166
00:10:42,720 --> 00:10:44,480
I promise this won't happen again.

167
00:10:44,480 --> 00:10:45,320
Xize,

168
00:10:45,320 --> 00:10:46,840
it's not that I don't want
to believe you.

169
00:10:48,080 --> 00:10:50,440
The Shen family can't tolerate me.

170
00:10:50,440 --> 00:10:51,600
Then let's leave the Shen family.

171
00:10:52,680 --> 00:10:53,760
Don't joke around.

172
00:10:54,400 --> 00:10:56,080
You're the son of the Shen family,

173
00:10:56,400 --> 00:10:58,320
the future big shot of Long City.

174
00:10:59,080 --> 00:11:00,760
I'm like a fragile reed,

175
00:11:00,760 --> 00:11:02,360
destined to drift in this chaotic world.

176
00:11:08,840 --> 00:11:10,360
Wherever you go, I'll go.

177
00:11:13,720 --> 00:11:15,240
But I don't want to see you torn

178
00:11:15,920 --> 00:11:17,880
between me and your family.

179
00:11:17,880 --> 00:11:18,760
Don't worry.

180
00:11:18,760 --> 00:11:20,440
They'll never treat you like this again.

181
00:11:43,440 --> 00:11:44,920
Why do you look so mysterious?

182
00:11:48,040 --> 00:11:48,800
Open it and see.

183
00:11:49,600 --> 00:11:50,480
What is it?

184
00:12:00,600 --> 00:12:01,600
This is too precious.

185
00:12:01,760 --> 00:12:02,560
In my eyes,

186
00:12:03,040 --> 00:12:04,560
you deserve all the good things
in the world.

187
00:12:08,280 --> 00:12:09,280
Then put it on me.

188
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:10,760
Gladly.

189
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:40,920
What is this?

190
00:12:44,760 --> 00:12:45,520
Xize,

191
00:12:47,680 --> 00:12:49,000
can you do me a favor?

192
00:12:51,560 --> 00:12:54,160
I've heard that body painting
is popular among foreigners.

193
00:12:54,760 --> 00:12:56,520
Since I have no model

194
00:12:56,520 --> 00:12:57,760
or paint,

195
00:12:58,280 --> 00:12:59,840
I have to use what's at hand.

196
00:13:01,920 --> 00:13:03,600
Can you help me color

197
00:13:05,440 --> 00:13:06,200
the flower's center?

198
00:13:10,800 --> 00:13:11,560
Sure.

199
00:13:42,920 --> 00:13:43,680
Xize,

200
00:13:44,800 --> 00:13:46,280
are you sincere with me?

201
00:13:47,680 --> 00:13:48,480
Of course.

202
00:13:49,520 --> 00:13:51,280
Completely sincere?

203
00:13:52,040 --> 00:13:53,040
With everything I have

204
00:13:53,680 --> 00:13:54,520
and everything you need.

205
00:13:56,040 --> 00:13:58,040
But I know nothing
about the Shen family.

206
00:13:58,640 --> 00:14:00,280
How can I trust you?

207
00:14:00,640 --> 00:14:01,840
What do you want to know?

208
00:14:02,120 --> 00:14:03,360
I'll tell you everything.
