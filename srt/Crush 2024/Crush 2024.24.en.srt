falls into your hands,

31
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:11,400

was injured by you.

00:02:16,480 --> 00:02:17,600
If you want his forgiveness,

36
00:02:18,320 --> 00:02:20,360
you need to show some sincerity.

37
00:02:34,680 --> 00:02:35,600
Is this enough?

38
00:02:35,800 --> 00:02:36,800
Mr. Kudo,

39
00:02:37,240 --> 00:02:38,600
is Fu Yunzheng sincere enough?

40
00:02:38,840 --> 00:02:40,240
Double it and it'll be enough.

41
00:03:26,200 --> 00:03:27,240

Why?

56
00:05:24,520 --> 00:05:25,840
He killed our dad.

57
00:05:25,840 --> 00:05:27,040
He destroyed the Shen family.
