Sir Fu,

15
00:01:23,040 --> 00:01:23,960
here's tea.

16
00:01:40,760 --> 00:01:42,280
Why did you drink so much?

17
00:01:43,520 --> 00:01:44,520
Moli.

18
00:01:48,120 --> 00:01:49,120
Moli.

19
00:01:58,200 --> 00:01:59,200
We should drink together.

20
00:02:27,520 --> 00:02:29,320
Xize, Xize.

21
00:03:14,440 --> 00:03:15,880
- You didn't...
- You didn't...

22
00:03:27,040 --> 00:03:28,520
I've arranged everything

23
00:03:28,520 --> 00:03:29,840
for tomorrow.

24
00:03:30,680 --> 00:03:32,920
Mom will bless us
and ensure our success.

25
00:03:54,640 --> 00:03:55,440
Xize.

26
00:03:55,440 --> 00:03:56,200
You're awake.

27
00:03:59,720 --> 00:04:00,560
Last night, I...

28
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:02,120
Last night, you drank too much.

29
00:04:02,440 --> 00:04:03,720
You just wouldn't wake up.

30
00:04:07,240 --> 00:04:08,240
It's my fault.

31
00:04:08,600 --> 00:04:09,960
I'll make it up to you tonight.

32
00:04:36,680 --> 00:04:38,960
I don't remember anything
from last night.

33
00:04:46,360 --> 00:04:47,160
Yunzheng.

34
00:04:52,680 --> 00:04:53,680
If you're awake, get up.

35
00:04:54,640 --> 00:04:56,200
We need to attend the ancestral worship.

36
00:04:59,240 --> 00:05:00,240
Yunzheng,

37
00:05:01,640 --> 00:05:03,040
last night,

38
00:05:03,280 --> 00:05:04,920
did we...

39
00:05:08,840 --> 00:05:09,680
What do you think?

40
00:05:18,320 --> 00:05:20,880
Today we open the ancestral hall
to welcome new members.

41
00:05:21,600 --> 00:05:24,280
May our ancestors bless the Shen family

42
00:05:24,760 --> 00:05:28,200
with enduring prosperity.

43
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:29,760
Good.

44
00:05:30,080 --> 00:05:31,160
You guys,

45
00:05:31,160 --> 00:05:32,600
come with me inside.

46
00:05:33,360 --> 00:05:34,240
Something's wrong!

47
00:05:34,800 --> 00:05:36,560
Something's wrong, master!

48
00:05:36,560 --> 00:05:37,760
There's a fire outside!

49
00:05:38,080 --> 00:05:38,800
Xize,

50
00:05:38,800 --> 00:05:40,000
take the guys to check it out.

51
00:05:40,920 --> 00:05:41,480
Moli,

52
00:05:41,480 --> 00:05:42,680
be careful.

53
00:05:46,280 --> 00:05:47,440
Everyone, don't panic.

54
00:05:47,440 --> 00:05:48,480
Follow me and take cover.

55
00:05:51,080 --> 00:05:52,120
Zhiwei.

56
00:06:35,820 --> 00:06:41,940
(In Memory of Beloved Wife, Fu)

57
00:07:08,840 --> 00:07:10,320
Mom?

58
00:07:11,360 --> 00:07:13,160
Put down what you're holding.

59
00:07:18,880 --> 00:07:20,720
What is your relationship
with this woman?

60
00:07:22,920 --> 00:07:24,560
Do you recognize

61
00:07:24,560 --> 00:07:26,200
the woman in the photo?

62
00:07:26,200 --> 00:07:27,000
Speak,

63
00:07:28,360 --> 00:07:29,640
or I'll burn it.

64
00:07:29,640 --> 00:07:30,560
Don't burn it!

65
00:07:32,520 --> 00:07:33,760
She was my wife,

66
00:07:33,760 --> 00:07:34,960
the woman I loved the most.

67
00:07:34,960 --> 00:07:36,240
You're lying.

68
00:07:36,240 --> 00:07:38,960
What's your relationship
with the woman in the photo?

69
00:07:38,960 --> 00:07:40,280
Who are you really?

70
00:07:41,320 --> 00:07:43,200
Fu Yaru is my mom.

71
00:07:55,520 --> 00:07:56,160
You...

72
00:07:56,960 --> 00:07:57,800
You...

73
00:07:59,200 --> 00:08:00,560
You're my daughter?

74
00:08:00,560 --> 00:08:02,240
No, I can't be.

75
00:08:02,240 --> 00:08:02,760
Child,

76
00:08:02,760 --> 00:08:03,400
listen to me.

77
00:08:03,400 --> 00:08:04,160
Child,

78
00:08:04,560 --> 00:08:06,320
let me show you something.

79
00:08:08,720 --> 00:08:10,480
This is the token of love
between your mom and me.

80
00:08:10,480 --> 00:08:11,320
She had one as well.

81
00:08:11,320 --> 00:08:12,600
You should recognize this.

82
00:08:17,120 --> 00:08:19,120
I've carried it with me all these years.

83
00:08:21,720 --> 00:08:22,720
Your mom and I

84
00:08:22,720 --> 00:08:24,960
met when I was doing business.

85
00:08:25,440 --> 00:08:27,360
We fell in love at first sight

86
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:29,320
and pledged ourselves to each other.

87
00:08:29,920 --> 00:08:31,160
But

88
00:08:31,480 --> 00:08:32,840
when your mom became pregnant,

89
00:08:32,840 --> 00:08:34,400
my family sent me overseas

90
00:08:34,400 --> 00:08:35,560
to handle a business deal.

91
00:08:35,560 --> 00:08:38,320
The trip lasted for years.

92
00:08:38,320 --> 00:08:39,200
I lost

93
00:08:39,760 --> 00:08:42,640
all contact with your mom.

94
00:08:43,240 --> 00:08:45,640
My days abroad were hard,

95
00:08:46,040 --> 00:08:47,440
but the first thing I did upon returning

96
00:08:47,440 --> 00:08:48,920
was to find your mom.

97
00:08:48,920 --> 00:08:50,000
To my surprise,

98
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:51,480
she had moved away

99
00:08:51,480 --> 00:08:52,840
and left no trace.

100
00:08:52,840 --> 00:08:54,480
Impossible, you're lying.

101
00:08:54,480 --> 00:08:55,800
I clearly saw you kill her.

102
00:08:55,800 --> 00:08:57,080
You killed her with your own hands.

103
00:08:57,080 --> 00:08:58,200
That was an accident.

104
00:08:59,680 --> 00:09:01,240
I went through great hardships

105
00:09:01,240 --> 00:09:02,800
and finally found you and your mom.

106
00:09:06,080 --> 00:09:07,320
But by then,

107
00:09:07,320 --> 00:09:09,320
your mom had been poisoned

108
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:13,040
and was already dying.

109
00:09:28,320 --> 00:09:29,320
Yaru.

110
00:09:35,400 --> 00:09:36,280
Yaru.

111
00:09:36,800 --> 00:09:38,000
Are you OK, Yaru?

112
00:09:38,920 --> 00:09:39,680
Yaru.

113
00:09:40,400 --> 00:09:41,720
Yaru, it's me.

114
00:09:42,640 --> 00:09:44,240
Yaru, are you OK?

115
00:09:45,320 --> 00:09:45,960
Yaru.

116
00:09:47,320 --> 00:09:48,080
Yaru.

117
00:09:52,280 --> 00:09:53,360
Yaru.

118
00:09:54,360 --> 00:09:55,560
Yaru.

119
00:09:59,480 --> 00:10:00,280
Impossible.

120
00:10:00,880 --> 00:10:03,040
Everything you say is a lie.

121
00:10:03,680 --> 00:10:05,360
You can't be my dad.

122
00:10:05,360 --> 00:10:06,920
I...I'm not lying.

123
00:10:06,920 --> 00:10:07,720
Yue!

124
00:10:08,160 --> 00:10:08,960
Yue!

125
00:10:09,380 --> 00:10:12,420
(Chiyan Gang)

126
00:10:24,440 --> 00:10:25,400
Yue,

127
00:10:25,400 --> 00:10:26,280
what's wrong?

128
00:10:29,360 --> 00:10:30,000
Yunzheng,

129
00:10:30,480 --> 00:10:31,440
today I heard

130
00:10:32,360 --> 00:10:34,840
the biggest joke ever.

131
00:10:36,200 --> 00:10:37,320
Master Shen

132
00:10:38,920 --> 00:10:40,640
claimed to be my real dad.

133
00:10:45,520 --> 00:10:47,040
What happened exactly?

134
00:10:53,920 --> 00:10:54,480
Dad,

135
00:10:54,480 --> 00:10:55,520
have you found Moli?

136
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:59,320
Yes, I found her, finally.

137
00:11:00,040 --> 00:11:00,840
Who did you find?

138
00:11:04,720 --> 00:11:07,200
I finally found your other sister.

139
00:11:09,200 --> 00:11:10,560
Sister?

140
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:15,120
Isn't it absurd?

141
00:11:15,120 --> 00:11:17,120
How could such a despicable person

142
00:11:18,200 --> 00:11:20,360
be my dad?

143
00:11:22,920 --> 00:11:23,760
He also said

144
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:27,200
he didn't kill my mom.

145
00:11:28,280 --> 00:11:29,480
He said my mom

146
00:11:29,480 --> 00:11:30,960
was poisoned

147
00:11:30,960 --> 00:11:32,120
and took her own life.

148
00:11:39,320 --> 00:11:40,520
How much truth can there be

149
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:42,200
in his words?

150
00:11:43,760 --> 00:11:44,640
Really?

151
00:11:48,240 --> 00:11:49,960
Since the ledger isn't
in the ancestral hall,

152
00:11:50,480 --> 00:11:51,680
marrying into the Shen family

153
00:11:51,680 --> 00:11:53,200
is meaningless.

154
00:11:53,200 --> 00:11:54,880
Let's leave

155
00:11:54,880 --> 00:11:56,320
and think of another way.

156
00:12:00,080 --> 00:12:00,840
No.

157
00:12:02,200 --> 00:12:03,800
I won't give up like this.

158
00:12:03,800 --> 00:12:04,360
Yue, you...

159
00:12:04,360 --> 00:12:05,240
Yunzheng,

160
00:12:05,880 --> 00:12:07,000
don't worry.

161
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:08,240
I know what I'm doing.

162
00:12:49,720 --> 00:12:51,080
(The sachet.)

163
00:12:59,120 --> 00:13:01,120
(Your mom had already been poisoned)

164
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:03,440
(and was dying.)

165
00:13:11,920 --> 00:13:13,640
The Shen family has a streak
of good fortune.

166
00:13:13,640 --> 00:13:14,960
Indeed.

167
00:13:14,960 --> 00:13:16,440
Even reporters
are here.

168
00:13:17,440 --> 00:13:19,520
- What do they have to announce?
- Master Shen is here.

169
00:13:19,520 --> 00:13:22,440
Hello, Master Shen.

170
00:13:22,440 --> 00:13:23,240
Everyone,

171
00:13:24,240 --> 00:13:25,400
today, I, Shen Wende,

172
00:13:25,960 --> 00:13:28,120
once again invite friends and family

173
00:13:28,120 --> 00:13:30,480
to witness the return

174
00:13:30,480 --> 00:13:32,600
of my long-lost youngest daughter

175
00:13:38,560 --> 00:13:39,680
to the Shen family.

176
00:13:40,560 --> 00:13:42,520
Bravo.

177
00:13:54,960 --> 00:13:56,160
