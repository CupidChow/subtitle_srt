00:01:17,360 --> 00:01:17,880
Sir Fu,

15
00:01:18,160 --> 00:01:19,800
Miss Zhiwei asks you to wait for a bit.

16
00:01:19,800 --> 00:01:20,800
She'll be back shortly.

17
00:01:25,360 --> 00:01:26,080
Fu Yunzheng.

18
00:01:28,280 --> 00:01:28,960
Brother-in-law.

19
00:01:30,960 --> 00:01:31,680
Yunzheng,

20
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:32,680
you came in time.

21
00:01:33,040 --> 00:01:34,040
I have something to ask you.

22
00:01:39,920 --> 00:01:41,320
I want to ask you,

23
00:01:43,240 --> 00:01:45,000
how do I confess to the girl I like?

24
00:01:48,240 --> 00:01:50,600
If you don't even know what she likes,

25
00:01:50,600 --> 00:01:52,360
I advise you not to waste your effort.

26
00:01:56,760 --> 00:01:58,680
What does she like?

27
00:02:08,760 --> 00:02:10,280
What were you doing just now?

28
00:02:10,640 --> 00:02:11,480
Yunzheng,

29
00:02:11,480 --> 00:02:12,720
I had a major discovery.

30
00:02:13,240 --> 00:02:15,520
I found Master Shen often visits
the ancestral hall.

31
00:02:17,200 --> 00:02:18,520
He's the head of the Shen family.

32
00:02:18,520 --> 00:02:19,520
It's only natural for him

33
00:02:19,520 --> 00:02:20,520
to go to the ancestral hall.

34
00:02:21,160 --> 00:02:22,160
But it's different.

35
00:02:23,400 --> 00:02:24,880
Ordinary family have the ancestral hall

36
00:02:24,880 --> 00:02:26,160
within their home.

37
00:02:26,440 --> 00:02:28,320
But the Shen family has theirs
on the back hill.

38
00:02:29,200 --> 00:02:31,000
Master Shen frequently goes there,

39
00:02:31,400 --> 00:02:33,360
often alone,

40
00:02:33,480 --> 00:02:35,040
sometimes even
in the middle of the night.

41
00:02:35,920 --> 00:02:37,440
There must be something fishy going on.

42
00:02:43,600 --> 00:02:44,400
Yunzheng,

43
00:02:44,880 --> 00:02:45,960
are you angry?

44
00:02:48,600 --> 00:02:50,000
Are you jealous?

45
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:53,960
I just want to tell you,

46
00:02:54,160 --> 00:02:55,760
when acting, be mindful
of the boundaries.

47
00:02:55,760 --> 00:02:57,160
Don't get yourself involved too deeply.

48
00:02:59,760 --> 00:03:01,960
What boundaries are appropriate?

49
00:03:03,320 --> 00:03:04,680
Holding hands can't be avoided, right?

50
00:03:05,720 --> 00:03:06,640
What about hugging?

51
00:03:07,240 --> 00:03:07,840
Kissing...

52
00:03:07,840 --> 00:03:08,200
Enough.

53
00:03:14,880 --> 00:03:15,760
Yunzheng.

54
00:03:40,560 --> 00:03:41,440
Yunzheng.

55
00:03:46,880 --> 00:03:48,240
You still remember me?

56
00:03:49,360 --> 00:03:51,000
I thought you already

57
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:53,000
fell in love with that girl named Moli.

58
00:03:54,400 --> 00:03:55,000
Sit.

59
00:03:57,520 --> 00:03:58,640
Yunzheng,

60
00:03:58,640 --> 00:04:00,320
you risked your life for Moli,

61
00:04:00,320 --> 00:04:01,600
but have you considered my feelings?

62
00:04:02,520 --> 00:04:03,400
I saved her

63
00:04:03,800 --> 00:04:05,280
for the sake of your little brother.

64
00:04:06,320 --> 00:04:07,120
My brother?

65
00:04:08,600 --> 00:04:09,840
If anything happens to her,

66
00:04:09,840 --> 00:04:11,880
Shen Xize would be devastated.

67
00:04:13,720 --> 00:04:15,800
You have a point.

68
00:04:17,720 --> 00:04:18,640
I don't know

69
00:04:18,640 --> 00:04:20,040
what's so special about that Moli.

70
00:04:20,440 --> 00:04:22,120
She's got that boy head over heels.

71
00:04:25,280 --> 00:04:26,360
Yunzheng,

72
00:04:26,760 --> 00:04:28,160
who do you think is better,

73
00:04:28,160 --> 00:04:28,960
me or Moli?

74
00:04:33,200 --> 00:04:34,600
The woman I choose

75
00:04:34,880 --> 00:04:36,400
is of course the best.

76
00:04:40,600 --> 00:04:41,680
You have good taste.

77
00:05:23,640 --> 00:05:24,440
Come.

78
00:05:35,120 --> 00:05:36,280
Catch this person.

79
00:05:36,680 --> 00:05:38,280
I want to see who he really is.

80
00:05:38,280 --> 00:05:38,840
Yes, sir.

81
00:06:10,960 --> 00:06:12,520
I knew it was you.

82
00:06:12,520 --> 00:06:13,680
Do you want to die?

83
00:06:13,680 --> 00:06:15,160
We had an agreement.

84
00:06:15,840 --> 00:06:17,320
Why did you act alone?

85
00:06:19,360 --> 00:06:20,520
I investigated.

86
00:06:21,160 --> 00:06:22,720
The times Master Shen
visits the ancestral hall

87
00:06:23,560 --> 00:06:26,000
coincide with the times
he receives and ships goods.

88
00:06:26,560 --> 00:06:28,040
The ledger must be
in the ancestral hall.

89
00:06:28,040 --> 00:06:29,760
But you shouldn't act alone.

90
00:06:29,760 --> 00:06:31,880
You saw how dangerous it's out there.

91
00:06:34,520 --> 00:06:35,280
Let me see.

92
00:06:45,640 --> 00:06:47,560
No matter how dangerous it was,

93
00:06:47,560 --> 00:06:49,200
didn't I still save you?

94
00:06:49,760 --> 00:06:51,560
You just don't trust me.

95
00:06:56,320 --> 00:06:57,160
Over there.

96
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:00,960
Your injury.

97
00:07:01,800 --> 00:07:03,000
The motorcycle is over there.

98
00:07:12,680 --> 00:07:14,480
This is your punishment
for acting alone.

99
00:07:32,280 --> 00:07:33,840
(You just don't trust me.)

100
00:07:35,320 --> 00:07:37,080
(You saw how dangerous it's out there.)

101
00:07:38,480 --> 00:07:40,440
(We had an agreement.)

102
00:07:56,960 --> 00:07:57,680
Xize.

103
00:07:58,200 --> 00:07:59,040
Moli,

104
00:07:59,040 --> 00:07:59,840
come with me.

105
00:08:01,400 --> 00:08:02,160
Where to?

106
00:08:02,600 --> 00:08:03,120
Come.

107
00:08:10,280 --> 00:08:11,200
Do you remember this place?

108
00:08:24,720 --> 00:08:25,640
You painted this?

109
00:08:25,880 --> 00:08:27,200
The first time I saw you,

110
00:08:27,760 --> 00:08:29,080
I knew I'd never forget you.

111
00:08:36,200 --> 00:08:37,280
Actually, I...

112
00:08:37,280 --> 00:08:38,080
I know.

113
00:08:38,520 --> 00:08:39,800
To you,

114
00:08:39,800 --> 00:08:40,760
what you did that day

115
00:08:40,760 --> 00:08:42,160
might've been a casual gesture.

116
00:08:42,320 --> 00:08:43,400
But to me,

117
00:08:43,640 --> 00:08:44,920
you not only saved my life,

118
00:08:44,920 --> 00:08:46,160
but also pulled me out

119
00:08:46,160 --> 00:08:47,000
of a meaningless life.

120
00:08:47,720 --> 00:08:48,320
Moli,

121
00:08:48,920 --> 00:08:50,520
you're like a light
illuminating my life.

122
00:08:51,480 --> 00:08:52,560
I want to take you

123
00:08:53,120 --> 00:08:54,720
to a place with bridges
and flowing river

124
00:08:55,240 --> 00:08:56,560
to live a peaceful life.

125
00:08:56,960 --> 00:08:58,360
You can paint all the beautiful scenery

126
00:08:59,040 --> 00:08:59,840
and I'll

127
00:08:59,840 --> 00:09:01,480
spend my life painting you.

128
00:09:04,280 --> 00:09:05,000
Xize,

129
00:09:05,440 --> 00:09:06,200
I'm sorry.

130
00:09:06,960 --> 00:09:08,400
Let's just stay friends.

131
00:09:09,160 --> 00:09:09,960
No,

132
00:09:10,560 --> 00:09:12,000
I don't want to be just friends.

133
00:09:12,400 --> 00:09:14,200
You're destined to be my woman.

134
00:09:16,480 --> 00:09:17,720
But for such an important matter,

135
00:09:17,720 --> 00:09:19,480
you should discuss it with your family.

136
00:09:19,480 --> 00:09:20,840
My dad can't control me.

137
00:09:21,520 --> 00:09:22,640
After we get married,

138
00:09:22,640 --> 00:09:23,960
I'll take you to the ancestral hall

139
00:09:23,960 --> 00:09:24,760
to see my granddad.

140
00:09:26,040 --> 00:09:26,840
The ancestral hall?

141
00:09:27,040 --> 00:09:29,080
My granddad loved me
the most in this world,

142
00:09:29,560 --> 00:09:31,120
but he passed away early.

143
00:09:31,760 --> 00:09:33,880
We can only enter the hall
on significant occasions.

144
00:09:34,280 --> 00:09:35,720
Otherwise I'd have taken you long ago.

145
00:09:36,200 --> 00:09:37,600
What significant occasion?

146
00:09:37,600 --> 00:09:38,720
A wedding, of course.

147
00:09:39,080 --> 00:09:40,920
Then they'll open it up,
making you a family member.

148
00:09:42,880 --> 00:09:43,680
I see.

149
00:09:44,880 --> 00:09:45,600
Moli,

150
00:09:45,600 --> 00:09:46,960
you agreed to my proposal,

151
00:09:46,960 --> 00:09:47,760
didn't you?

152
00:09:48,720 --> 00:09:49,600
You agreed?

153
00:09:49,880 --> 00:09:50,840
You agreed!

154
00:10:10,280 --> 00:10:11,520
This way, please.

155
00:10:30,680 --> 00:10:31,680
Our guests have arrived.

156
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:35,360
Zhiwei, Yunzheng, have a seat.

157
00:10:43,120 --> 00:10:43,800
Xize,

158
00:10:44,120 --> 00:10:46,200
you booked the entire restaurant?

159
00:10:46,200 --> 00:10:47,960
What's the big occasion?

160
00:10:48,440 --> 00:10:49,920
To celebrate

161
00:10:49,920 --> 00:10:51,000
my successful proposal.

162
00:10:52,280 --> 00:10:53,400
It's all thanks to Yunzheng.

163
00:10:53,760 --> 00:10:55,520
He taught me to cater to her interests.

164
00:10:55,520 --> 00:10:57,480
So I thought of using painting

165
00:10:57,480 --> 00:10:58,560
to confess to Moli,

166
00:10:58,960 --> 00:11:00,840
and it worked.

167
00:11:06,200 --> 00:11:07,240
In that case,

168
00:11:07,920 --> 00:11:09,200
we should toast to Sir Fu

169
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:11,040
- I'll drink.
- to thank him.

170
00:11:13,680 --> 00:11:14,760
You follow who you marry.

171
00:11:15,240 --> 00:11:16,400
What a harmonious couple.

172
00:11:17,720 --> 00:11:18,440
Of course,

173
00:11:19,760 --> 00:11:21,080
when Xize and I get married,

174
00:11:21,440 --> 00:11:22,560
we'll ask you, our matchmaker,

175
00:11:22,560 --> 00:11:24,000
to be the officiant.

176
00:11:24,520 --> 00:11:25,840
When we have children,

177
00:11:26,440 --> 00:11:28,600
we'll ask you to be the godfather.

178
00:11:34,120 --> 00:11:35,360
Sir Fu, is your hand injured?

179
00:11:35,360 --> 00:11:36,640
You can't even hold the glass steadily.

180
00:11:37,720 --> 00:11:38,680
Injured?

181
00:11:38,840 --> 00:11:39,920
When did this happen?

182
00:11:43,360 --> 00:11:45,040
Got bitten by my cat.

183
00:11:45,360 --> 00:11:47,120
I'll have to teach it a lesson.

184
00:11:51,520 --> 00:11:53,320
When raising a cat, you have to
pet it the right way

185
00:11:53,600 --> 00:11:54,800
and be wholeheartedly devoted.

186
00:11:55,960 --> 00:11:58,520
Sir Fu, did you get another one

187
00:11:58,520 --> 00:11:59,760
and made it unhappy?

188
00:12:00,080 --> 00:12:01,680
Be careful. If it runs away,

189
00:12:01,680 --> 00:12:02,760
it might never come back.
