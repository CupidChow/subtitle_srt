promise me

50

I'll take good care of Yue.

Mom,

57
00:03:36,400 --> 00:03:38,000
don't die.

58
00:03:38,480 --> 00:03:40,440
I don't want anything.

00:03:40,440 --> 00:03:42,120

68
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:06,800
who do you think

69
00:04:07,280 --> 00:04:08,440
dared to cause trouble

70
00:04:08,440 --> 00:04:10,440
in our Shen family?

71
00:04:11,320 --> 00:04:12,400
Go,

72
00:04:12,400 --> 00:04:14,040
investigate that Moli.

73
00:04:15,200 --> 00:04:16,080
Master,

74
00:04:16,080 --> 00:04:17,720
are you suspicious of her background

75
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:19,560
or does she not suit your taste?

76
00:04:25,520 --> 00:04:26,920
She's just like this orange.

77
00:04:27,760 --> 00:04:30,560
It looks enticingly green,

78
00:04:32,240 --> 00:04:33,840
but we must ensure

79
00:04:33,840 --> 00:04:35,560
it's harmless

80
00:04:35,560 --> 00:04:37,080
before we

81
00:04:37,440 --> 00:04:39,040
consume it.

88
00:05:53,600 --> 00:05:54,720
Why is she in my house?

89
00:05:55,520 --> 00:05:56,120
Miss Zhiwei,

90
00:05:56,120 --> 00:05:57,640
Sir Xize brought her back.

91
00:05:59,360 --> 00:06:00,640
She dared to seduce Yunzhen.

92
00:06:00,920 --> 00:06:02,160
I haven't settled the score with her.

93
00:06:02,760 --> 00:06:04,120
She's delivered herself to my door.

94
00:06:08,800 --> 00:06:09,800
Let's go.

95
00:06:19,960 --> 00:06:21,560
Shen Wende is very cunning.

96
00:06:22,320 --> 00:06:24,360
He won't be easily fooled.

97
00:06:24,960 --> 00:06:25,960
I've already sent someone

98
00:06:25,960 --> 00:06:27,320
to handle Miss Yue's identity.

99
00:06:27,960 --> 00:06:29,160
Send someone else

100
00:06:29,160 --> 00:06:30,200
to watch her 24 hours a day.

101
00:06:30,480 --> 00:06:31,040
Yes.

102
00:06:31,800 --> 00:06:32,320
Sir Fu,

103
00:06:32,640 --> 00:06:33,760
Master Shen is waiting.

104
00:06:41,640 --> 00:06:42,200
Moli,

105
00:06:43,440 --> 00:06:44,640
are you going to find Xize?

106
00:06:46,200 --> 00:06:47,720
He left with my dad early this morning.

107
00:06:49,680 --> 00:06:50,960
Thank you for letting me know.

108
00:06:51,160 --> 00:06:52,400
Then I'll just wait for him.

109
00:06:52,520 --> 00:06:53,800
Waiting is so boring.

110
00:06:54,040 --> 00:06:56,000
Let me take you around

111
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:57,600
and play host on Xize's behalf.

112
00:06:57,920 --> 00:06:58,360
Let's go.

113
00:07:09,040 --> 00:07:10,920
Xize said you're a student,

114
00:07:11,320 --> 00:07:12,920
working part-time at a flower shop.

115
00:07:15,120 --> 00:07:16,200
My family isn't well-off,

116
00:07:16,520 --> 00:07:17,920
so I work during the holidays

117
00:07:17,920 --> 00:07:19,120
to earn some money.

118
00:07:21,920 --> 00:07:23,000
No wonder.

119
00:07:24,200 --> 00:07:25,560
Whenever there's a wealthy man,

120
00:07:25,560 --> 00:07:26,920
you want to hook up with him.

121
00:07:29,800 --> 00:07:31,320
Miss Shen, what do you mean?

122
00:07:33,520 --> 00:07:35,760
You just met Xize
and now you're living in his house.

123
00:07:36,240 --> 00:07:38,560
You barely knew Yunzheng,
and you're already seducing him.

124
00:07:39,360 --> 00:07:42,560
You want to climb the social ladder?

125
00:07:42,560 --> 00:07:45,000
You don't look like
an innocent student at all,

126
00:07:47,520 --> 00:07:49,120
more like a shameless wretch.

127
00:07:55,840 --> 00:07:56,600
What are you doing?

128
00:07:56,920 --> 00:07:58,160
I'm a guest of your brother.

129
00:07:59,280 --> 00:08:01,400
Who you are doesn't matter to me.

130
00:08:01,920 --> 00:08:04,200
Any woman who tries
to get close to Yunzheng

131
00:08:05,360 --> 00:08:06,360
must die.

132
00:08:28,440 --> 00:08:30,320
(Being impatient will ruin my plan.)

133

in the Shen family)

Moli.

00:11:38,760 --> 00:11:39,480
How are you feeling?

156
00:11:39,480 --> 00:11:40,400
What happened?

157
00:11:43,840 --> 00:11:44,920
You should ask Miss Shen

158
00:11:45,520 --> 00:11:47,200
about what happened.

159
00:11:48,320 --> 00:11:49,920
Zhiwei, stop denying it.

160
00:11:49,920 --> 00:11:51,400
I was worried she might be dirty,

161
00:11:51,400 --> 00:11:52,800
so I helped her wash off in the lake.

162
00:11:53,320 --> 00:11:54,920
Zhiwei, you're a woman too.

163
00:11:54,920 --> 00:11:55,960
How can you compare her with me?

164
00:12:23,080 --> 00:12:23,720
Xize,

165
00:12:24,120 --> 00:12:24,800
don't fight with her

166
00:12:24,800 --> 00:12:25,640
because of me.

167
00:12:26,720 --> 00:12:27,480
Don't let me be

168
00:12:27,480 --> 00:12:28,720
the cause of discord between you two.

169
00:12:29,720 --> 00:12:31,080
If your sister doesn't like me,

170
00:12:31,520 --> 00:12:32,800
then I'll just leave.

171
00:12:35,360 --> 00:12:35,880
Moli.

172
00:12:37,640 --> 00:12:38,520
Shen Xize.

173
00:12:58,760 --> 00:12:59,200
Moli.

174
00:13:01,080 --> 00:13:02,320
This is all my sister's fault.

175
00:13:03,800 --> 00:13:04,720
She should be leaving,

176
00:13:04,720 --> 00:13:05,720
not you.

177
00:13:05,920 --> 00:13:07,680
Today was just a small lesson.

178
00:13:08,160 --> 00:13:09,480
Anyone who dares to mess with my man

179
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:11,320
won't have it easy.

180
00:13:11,760 --> 00:13:12,560
And I'm telling you,

181
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:14,520
Moli can stay in the Shen family

182
00:13:14,520 --> 00:13:15,480

183
00:13:15,800 --> 00:13:16,800
If anyone bullies her,

184
00:13:16,960 --> 00:13:17,880
there'll be consequences.

185
00:13:25,240 --> 00:13:26,720
Xize, thank you.

186
00:13:26,720 --> 00:13:28,160
Moli, you must've been frightened.

187
00:13:28,760 --> 00:13:30,440
I need to apologize
on behalf of my sister.

188
00:13:30,440 --> 00:13:32,240
I'll book a table

189
00:13:32,240 --> 00:13:33,960
