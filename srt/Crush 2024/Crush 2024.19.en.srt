14
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:20,760
Yue,

15
00:01:21,240 --> 00:01:22,960
isn't this too risky?

16
00:01:22,960 --> 00:01:24,040
At this point,

17
00:01:24,920 --> 00:01:26,800
backing out would only
raise more suspicion.

18
00:01:27,160 --> 00:01:28,920
Being Shen Wende's daughter

19
00:01:29,280 --> 00:01:31,200
will be advantageous for our plan.

20
00:01:31,200 --> 00:01:32,640
Shen Wende is cunning.

21
00:01:33,200 --> 00:01:34,840
Be wary of any schemes he might have.

22
00:01:36,120 --> 00:01:38,120
Don't worry, I'll be careful.

23
00:01:44,040 --> 00:01:46,120
(If what happened back then)

24
00:01:46,120 --> 00:01:48,880
(is truly as Shen Wende said,)

25
00:01:48,880 --> 00:01:50,960
(then would my real enemy)

26
00:01:51,320 --> 00:01:52,880
(be you,)

27
00:01:53,560 --> 00:01:55,080
(Fu Yunzheng?)

28
00:01:57,360 --> 00:01:58,040
Alright.

29
00:01:58,040 --> 00:01:58,840
Goodbye.

30
00:01:58,840 --> 00:01:59,960
Farewell, take care.

31
00:02:01,800 --> 00:02:02,280
Goodbye.

32
00:02:02,680 --> 00:02:03,320
Dad,

33
00:02:04,440 --> 00:02:05,600
I refuse to be sisters

34
00:02:05,600 --> 00:02:06,360
with that woman.

35
00:02:06,360 --> 00:02:06,760
Rascal!

36
00:02:07,560 --> 00:02:08,760
How dare you address her that?

37
00:02:09,040 --> 00:02:11,760
Watch your attitude and language.

38
00:02:13,200 --> 00:02:14,040
- Dad...
- Alright.

39
00:02:15,120 --> 00:02:16,360
Is there anything else?

40
00:02:18,240 --> 00:02:18,640
Dad,

41
00:02:19,160 --> 00:02:20,440
when will we open the ancestral hall?

42
00:02:20,720 --> 00:02:21,800
As long as Yunzheng and I

43
00:02:21,800 --> 00:02:23,400
haven't signed the marriage contract

44
00:02:23,400 --> 00:02:24,200
and get registered,

45
00:02:24,200 --> 00:02:25,680
we're not truly married.

46
00:02:26,920 --> 00:02:27,680
Hmm.

47
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:28,880
I need to

48
00:02:28,880 --> 00:02:30,200
think about this.

49
00:02:31,360 --> 00:02:31,920
In the meantime,

50
00:02:32,240 --> 00:02:33,720
stay home

51
00:02:33,720 --> 00:02:34,680
and

52
00:02:34,680 --> 00:02:35,920
don't go anywhere.

53
00:02:35,920 --> 00:02:37,600
Why? I don't want to.

54
00:02:37,600 --> 00:02:38,760
Are you defying me too?

55
00:02:40,200 --> 00:02:41,840
I'll have people watch you.

56
00:02:41,840 --> 00:02:43,400
Don't you dare run around.

57
00:02:55,120 --> 00:02:56,000
It's all your fault.

58
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:57,920
Things turned out this way
because of you.

59
00:02:58,560 --> 00:03:00,520
First, you stole my man

60
00:03:00,520 --> 00:03:02,160
and now you're stealing my father.

61
00:03:02,440 --> 00:03:03,960
You're a curse, a jinx.

62
00:03:04,520 --> 00:03:05,480
You deserve to die.

63
00:03:07,520 --> 00:03:08,040
Today,

64
00:03:08,440 --> 00:03:10,320
I'll teach you the rules
of the Shen family.

65
00:03:16,400 --> 00:03:17,360
You dare to hit me?

66
00:03:17,600 --> 00:03:18,640
I did it, so what?

67
00:03:18,640 --> 00:03:19,600
No need for a reason.

68
00:03:20,840 --> 00:03:22,160
That slap was just payback

69
00:03:22,720 --> 00:03:24,720
for you hitting me.

70
00:03:25,520 --> 00:03:27,080
Don't think your evil deeds

71
00:03:27,080 --> 00:03:28,160
go unnoticed.

72
00:03:28,520 --> 00:03:29,760
For what you did in the past,

73
00:03:29,960 --> 00:03:32,120
I'll settle the score with you
in the future.

74
00:03:45,840 --> 00:03:46,840
What's going on?

75
00:03:47,360 --> 00:03:49,000
Yesterday, you were my wife

76
00:03:49,640 --> 00:03:51,320
and today you're my sister?

77
00:03:53,360 --> 00:03:53,880
I'm sorry,

78
00:03:53,880 --> 00:03:54,640
Xize.

79
00:03:55,160 --> 00:03:56,080
I don't know

80
00:03:56,080 --> 00:03:57,200
why things turned out this way.

81
00:03:58,360 --> 00:03:59,240
It's all fake,

82
00:03:59,240 --> 00:04:00,080
right?

83
00:04:00,080 --> 00:04:01,000
You're Moli,

84
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:02,280
not my sister, right?

85
00:04:02,280 --> 00:04:03,480
This is all a misunderstanding.

86
00:04:03,800 --> 00:04:05,280
It's all fake, right?

87
00:04:08,640 --> 00:04:09,440
Xize.

88
00:04:18,240 --> 00:04:18,840
Xize,

89
00:04:20,160 --> 00:04:20,960
I'm sorry.

90
00:04:25,720 --> 00:04:27,160
Why is it after all my efforts

91
00:04:27,160 --> 00:04:28,280
- and all the time,
- Xize.

92
00:04:28,280 --> 00:04:29,560
I still can't have you?

93
00:04:29,960 --> 00:04:31,160
What do I have to do

94
00:04:31,160 --> 00:04:33,120
to make you give yourself
completely to me?

95
00:04:34,760 --> 00:04:35,800
Xize,

96
00:04:35,800 --> 00:04:37,720
love isn't an equal exchange.

97
00:04:37,720 --> 00:04:39,200
Besides, I'm your sister.

98
00:04:39,200 --> 00:04:40,520
You're deceiving me.

99
00:04:40,840 --> 00:04:42,240
Who do you truly love?

100
00:04:42,480 --> 00:04:43,320
Fu Yunzheng?

101
00:04:45,800 --> 00:04:47,040
I thought

102
00:04:47,040 --> 00:04:49,320
if I outshone Fu Yunzheng,

103
00:04:49,920 --> 00:04:51,280
you'd fall for me.

104
00:04:51,560 --> 00:04:53,160
So I competed with him at every turn,

105
00:04:53,680 --> 00:04:55,520
even using Shen Zhiwei

106
00:04:55,520 --> 00:04:57,480
to create opportunities.

107
00:04:57,480 --> 00:04:59,080
But I was always a step behind him.

108
00:05:26,280 --> 00:05:28,000
It turns out you're the one
pulling the strings.

109
00:05:50,120 --> 00:05:50,880
Shen Xize,

110
00:05:52,120 --> 00:05:53,160
from now on,

111
00:05:53,760 --> 00:05:55,120
we're only siblings,

112
00:05:55,960 --> 00:05:57,280
and nothing more.

113
00:06:17,800 --> 00:06:18,600
(Chiyan Gang)
Yunzheng,

114
00:06:19,480 --> 00:06:21,360
it's been a long time

115
00:06:21,360 --> 00:06:22,680
since we sat down

116
00:06:22,680 --> 00:06:23,840
and had a meal together.

117
00:06:24,560 --> 00:06:25,960
Tonight, we drink
to our hearts' content.

118
00:06:26,320 --> 00:06:26,920
Good.

119
00:06:38,080 --> 00:06:38,840
Yunzheng,

120
00:06:41,320 --> 00:06:42,040
is there

121
00:06:42,920 --> 00:06:44,120
a drug

122
00:06:44,800 --> 00:06:46,360
that can stimulate a person's body,

123
00:06:47,600 --> 00:06:48,960
making them

124
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:51,000
want to die from the pain?

125
00:06:55,320 --> 00:06:56,480
I'm not a doctor.

126
00:06:56,920 --> 00:06:58,080
How would I know about drugs?

127
00:07:05,320 --> 00:07:07,520
Lately, I've been dreaming
about our childhood

128
00:07:08,720 --> 00:07:09,800
and our mom.

129
00:07:17,040 --> 00:07:17,760
If she really

130
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:21,480
was injected

131
00:07:21,480 --> 00:07:22,560
with such a drug,

132
00:07:24,040 --> 00:07:25,120
how much pain

133
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:27,080
and suffering would she endure?

134
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:28,760
Right?

135
00:07:33,560 --> 00:07:34,360
Yue,

136
00:07:35,560 --> 00:07:36,600
stop overthinking it.

137
00:07:37,120 --> 00:07:38,520
Leave everything to me.

138
00:07:46,920 --> 00:07:48,520
Then tonight, let's get drunk.

139
00:07:49,840 --> 00:07:50,600
Alright.

140
00:08:20,840 --> 00:08:21,600
Sir Fu,

141
00:08:22,320 --> 00:08:23,800
did Miss Yue learn something

142
00:08:23,800 --> 00:08:24,680
from Master Shen?

143
00:08:24,960 --> 00:08:25,600
Shut up.

144
00:08:54,080 --> 00:08:55,360
Take this and get rid of it now.

145
00:08:55,360 --> 00:08:57,720
Yue must never find out.

146
00:08:57,720 --> 00:08:59,720
We've come too far

147
00:08:59,720 --> 00:09:01,080
to fail now.

148
00:09:01,080 --> 00:09:02,160
Yes, Sir Fu.

149
00:10:11,040 --> 00:10:12,720
If I remember correctly,

150
00:10:12,720 --> 00:10:13,880
there was a batch

151
00:10:13,880 --> 00:10:15,640
of smuggled anti-inflammatory drugs

152
00:10:15,640 --> 00:10:17,040
in the city a long time ago.

153
00:10:18,400 --> 00:10:19,760
But since it's a drug,

154
00:10:20,320 --> 00:10:21,600
it should be for healing,

155
00:10:21,600 --> 00:10:22,960
not harming, right?

156
00:10:24,720 --> 00:10:27,400
It's an incomplete
and defective product.

157
00:10:27,400 --> 00:10:29,800
It appears to temporarily
numb the nerves

158
00:10:29,800 --> 00:10:31,080
and suppress pain.

159
00:10:31,080 --> 00:10:31,720
But in reality,

160
00:10:31,720 --> 00:10:33,040
it causes irreversible damage

161
00:10:33,040 --> 00:10:34,600
to the body.

162
00:10:35,040 --> 00:10:35,920
Moreover,

163
00:10:35,920 --> 00:10:38,360
if the dosage isn't controlled well,

164
00:10:38,360 --> 00:10:39,600
it's highly lethal.

165
00:10:41,160 --> 00:10:42,560
That's why it was banned back then,

166
00:10:42,560 --> 00:10:43,760
because many used it

167
00:10:43,760 --> 00:10:45,520
to kill people

168
00:10:45,520 --> 00:10:47,200
without anyone noticing.

169
00:10:52,680 --> 00:10:53,480
Mom,

170
00:10:55,400 --> 00:10:56,480
I've suddenly realized,

171
00:10:56,480 --> 00:10:58,760
this world is full of deceit and lies.

172
00:11:01,800 --> 00:11:03,280
Are Shen Wende's words

173
00:11:04,280 --> 00:11:05,560
true or not?

174
00:11:07,400 --> 00:11:08,520
Is Fu Yunzheng

175
00:11:09,680 --> 00:11:11,520
deceiving me?

176
00:11:14,800 --> 00:11:16,760
Who should I truly hate?

177
00:11:18,880 --> 00:11:20,280
I can't tell anymore.

178
00:11:41,780 --> 00:11:44,060
(In Memory of Beloved Mother, Fu Yaru)

179
00:11:46,120 --> 00:11:47,120
Mom,

180
00:11:48,080 --> 00:11:48,960
rest assured.

181
00:11:49,600 --> 00:11:51,320
I'll avenge you.

182
00:11:52,200 --> 00:11:54,360
I'll make those

183
00:11:54,360 --> 00:11:55,600
who have deceived,

184
00:11:55,600 --> 00:11:57,280
lied and used us

185
00:11:57,640 --> 00:11:59,160
pay the price.

186
00:12:09,720 --> 00:12:10,480
