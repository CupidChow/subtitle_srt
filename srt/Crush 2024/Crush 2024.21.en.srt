Go.

15
00:01:51,240 --> 00:01:52,080
Yue.

16
00:01:57,120 --> 00:01:58,320
- Dad.
- Yue.

17
00:01:59,080 --> 00:02:00,520
These past few days have worn you out.

18
00:02:01,240 --> 00:02:02,280
I specifically

19
00:02:02,280 --> 00:02:04,360
asked them to make soup for you.

20
00:02:04,360 --> 00:02:05,800
Take some time to replenish yourself.

21
00:02:06,600 --> 00:02:07,440
Thank you, dad.

22
00:02:07,960 --> 00:02:09,240
This is all my duty as your daughter.

23
00:02:10,360 --> 00:02:12,520
You stalled Fu Yunzheng for me

24
00:02:12,520 --> 00:02:13,960
and secured the Chiyan Token.

25
00:02:13,960 --> 00:02:15,440
Now the waterway routes

26
00:02:15,440 --> 00:02:16,720
of the Chiyan Gang

27
00:02:16,720 --> 00:02:18,240
all belong to our Shen family.

28
00:02:19,360 --> 00:02:20,040
Yue,

29
00:02:20,360 --> 00:02:22,200
you truly are my lucky star.

30
00:02:23,600 --> 00:02:24,480
Thank you, dad.

31
00:02:26,120 --> 00:02:27,320
But

32
00:02:27,760 --> 00:02:29,240
old institutions

33
00:02:29,240 --> 00:02:30,360
die hard.

34
00:02:30,840 --> 00:02:31,840
Chiyan Gang

35
00:02:32,120 --> 00:02:33,040
was built by Fu Yunzheng

36
00:02:33,040 --> 00:02:34,800
through blood and sweat.

37
00:02:34,800 --> 00:02:36,240
Although their territory is lost,

38
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:38,120
these people

39
00:02:38,120 --> 00:02:39,640
are loyal

40
00:02:39,640 --> 00:02:41,200
to Fu Yunzheng.

41
00:02:41,200 --> 00:02:43,240
If they ever retaliate,

42
00:02:44,320 --> 00:02:45,560
it'd be a big problem.

43
00:02:47,920 --> 00:02:49,720
Even ants can kill an elephant

44
00:02:49,720 --> 00:02:51,000
by nibbling at it.

45
00:02:51,800 --> 00:02:53,160
Dad, don't worry.

46
00:02:53,760 --> 00:02:55,320
With my understanding
of the Chiyan Gang,

47
00:02:55,680 --> 00:02:57,080
it's not difficult

48
00:02:57,600 --> 00:02:58,040
to ruin it.

49
00:02:58,560 --> 00:03:00,000
I'm not questioning your ability.

50
00:03:01,560 --> 00:03:02,920
After all, you and Fu Yunzheng

51
00:03:02,920 --> 00:03:04,320
grew up together

52
00:03:04,320 --> 00:03:05,600
from childhood.

53
00:03:05,600 --> 00:03:07,800
When it comes to life and death,

54
00:03:08,160 --> 00:03:09,440
I fear you might

55
00:03:09,440 --> 00:03:11,000
feel troubled.

56
00:03:16,840 --> 00:03:18,960
I've long wanted to tear him to pieces.

57
00:03:19,520 --> 00:03:20,000
Dad,

58
00:03:20,760 --> 00:03:21,440
rest assured.

59
00:03:22,120 --> 00:03:23,880
He owes my mom his life.

60
00:03:25,800 --> 00:03:26,520
Tonight.

61
00:03:27,040 --> 00:03:28,480
Tonight, I'll send him on his way.

62
00:03:32,520 --> 00:03:33,200
Yue,

63
00:03:33,720 --> 00:03:35,240
you've achieved great merit this time.

64
00:03:35,240 --> 00:03:37,200
I'll make sure

65
00:03:37,520 --> 00:03:38,840
to note it down for you.

66
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:42,120
Master, master.

67
00:03:42,120 --> 00:03:42,840
Bad news.

68
00:03:42,840 --> 00:03:43,920
Fu Yunzheng has escaped.

69
00:03:46,400 --> 00:03:47,080
Let's go.

70
00:04:02,640 --> 00:04:03,320
What happened?

71
00:04:03,520 --> 00:04:04,680
It was Wei Zhan.

72
00:04:04,880 --> 00:04:05,640
He just escaped.

73
00:04:05,640 --> 00:04:06,120
Useless.

74
00:04:06,600 --> 00:04:07,000
Get him.

75
00:04:07,360 --> 00:04:07,800
Yes.

76
00:04:08,120 --> 00:04:08,520
Yes.

77
00:04:35,800 --> 00:04:37,120
Come with us,

78
00:04:37,800 --> 00:04:39,040
Miss Yue.

79
00:04:41,160 --> 00:04:42,320
Let go of me.

80
00:04:44,200 --> 00:04:45,200
What do you want to do?

81
00:04:46,160 --> 00:04:46,960
Do you know

82
00:04:47,360 --> 00:04:49,080
the consequence of betraying
the Chiyan Gang?

83
00:04:50,080 --> 00:04:51,400
Anyone who betrays my gang

84
00:04:52,040 --> 00:04:54,720
will be tied to the pillar
for three days.

85
00:04:54,720 --> 00:04:57,520
Any member can do as they please.

86
00:04:57,840 --> 00:05:00,600
Fu Yunzheng, you might as well kill me.

87
00:05:02,320 --> 00:05:03,680
I do want to kill you.

88
00:05:04,880 --> 00:05:06,040
But you and I

89
00:05:06,040 --> 00:05:07,320
are siblings after all.

90
00:05:07,960 --> 00:05:09,280
The punishment for you

91
00:05:10,120 --> 00:05:12,200
will naturally be special.

92
00:05:15,880 --> 00:05:17,800
Fu Yunzheng, don't you dare touch me!

93
00:05:25,560 --> 00:05:27,160
How about

94
00:05:27,440 --> 00:05:29,400
I carve my name

95
00:05:30,040 --> 00:05:31,320
on your beautiful body?

96
00:05:32,240 --> 00:05:33,880
So you'll remember for life

97
00:05:34,560 --> 00:05:36,080
the consequence of betraying me.

98
00:05:52,440 --> 00:05:53,640
This character

99
00:05:53,640 --> 00:05:55,240
will stay with you forever.

100
00:05:56,160 --> 00:05:58,400
No matter who undresses you
in the future,

101
00:05:59,440 --> 00:06:01,880
they'll know you betrayed Fu Yunzheng.

102
00:06:06,080 --> 00:06:07,200
Fu Yunzheng,

103
00:06:07,200 --> 00:06:08,560
I'll kill you!

104
00:06:38,840 --> 00:06:39,480
Master,

105
00:06:40,400 --> 00:06:41,440
we've investigated.

106
00:06:42,040 --> 00:06:43,080
Miss Yue

107
00:06:43,520 --> 00:06:45,400
was captured by Fu Yunzheng.

108
00:06:51,680 --> 00:06:52,360
Miss Yue

109
00:06:52,360 --> 00:06:53,960
caused significant losses
to the Chiyan Gang.

110
00:06:54,920 --> 00:06:56,440
Fu Yunzheng won't let her off easily.

111
00:06:56,720 --> 00:06:57,560
Now

112
00:06:57,880 --> 00:07:00,680
Fu Yunyue has found her mom's killer.

113
00:07:01,120 --> 00:07:03,000
I've seized the Chiyan Gang's territory.

114
00:07:03,480 --> 00:07:04,920
No one is at a loss.

115
00:07:05,480 --> 00:07:07,000
Master, you're wise.

116
00:07:07,760 --> 00:07:09,280
We used the pretense of leaving the city

117
00:07:09,600 --> 00:07:11,200
to secretly plan and observe.

118
00:07:11,200 --> 00:07:13,120
We learned all

119
00:07:13,120 --> 00:07:14,440
about their plans and secrets.

120
00:07:14,800 --> 00:07:16,080
With a little trick,

121
00:07:16,080 --> 00:07:18,040
we fooled Fu Yunyue completely,

122
00:07:18,040 --> 00:07:19,360
turning her and Fu Yunzheng

123
00:07:19,360 --> 00:07:20,520
against each other.

124
00:07:20,520 --> 00:07:21,480
Clever, isn't it?

125
00:07:26,600 --> 00:07:27,760
Speaking of which,

126
00:07:27,760 --> 00:07:29,960
Fu Yunyue indeed has some skills.

127
00:07:30,560 --> 00:07:31,880
But whether she truly thinks

128
00:07:31,880 --> 00:07:32,840
I'm her father

129
00:07:34,280 --> 00:07:35,280
still needs to be confirmed.

130
00:07:37,600 --> 00:07:39,640
But master, don't worry.

131
00:07:39,640 --> 00:07:41,160
Just sit back at home

132
00:07:41,160 --> 00:07:42,120
and enjoy the show.

133
00:07:42,920 --> 00:07:44,040
If Fu Yunyue

134
00:07:44,040 --> 00:07:46,040
kills Fu Yunzheng,

135
00:07:46,480 --> 00:07:47,680
you can rest assured.

136
00:07:48,560 --> 00:07:49,560
Even if they

137
00:07:49,920 --> 00:07:51,400
end up harming

138
00:07:52,120 --> 00:07:53,240
each other,

139
00:07:53,920 --> 00:07:54,960
it'll be

140
00:07:54,960 --> 00:07:56,040
beneficial to you, master.

141
00:07:57,440 --> 00:07:58,400
Well said.

142
00:08:00,120 --> 00:08:01,960
The harder they fight,

143
00:08:02,600 --> 00:08:03,960
the easier my grand plan

144
00:08:04,800 --> 00:08:05,640
will succeed.

145
00:08:21,120 --> 00:08:22,520
Miss Yue really went all out.

146
00:08:22,880 --> 00:08:24,040
She even dared to hurt you.

147
00:08:27,760 --> 00:08:28,960
The play has to be real

148
00:08:29,320 --> 00:08:30,960
for the audience to believe it.

149
00:08:30,960 --> 00:08:32,600
Do you mean to say

150
00:08:32,600 --> 00:08:33,800
Miss Yue did it on purpose?

151
00:08:33,800 --> 00:08:34,760
I know her.

152
00:08:35,600 --> 00:08:37,760
Even if Shen Wende is truly
her biological father,

153
00:08:38,560 --> 00:08:39,640
she wouldn't believe

154
00:08:39,640 --> 00:08:40,920
what he said.

155
00:08:41,440 --> 00:08:43,160
Then why would she call him father?

156
00:08:47,200 --> 00:08:48,120
She must

157
00:08:51,760 --> 00:08:53,120
have a bigger plan.

158
00:08:55,600 --> 00:08:57,640
How could she deceive Master Shen alone?

159
00:08:57,640 --> 00:08:59,400
In war, someone has to be sacrificed.

160
00:09:00,680 --> 00:09:02,320
She used me as her pledge of loyalty

161
00:09:04,560 --> 00:09:06,120
to achieve her desires.

162
00:09:06,840 --> 00:09:10,160
(Zheng)

163
00:09:10,160 --> 00:09:13,200
(Master Shen didn't come to rescue me)

164
00:09:13,200 --> 00:09:16,360
(because he still doesn't
fully trust me.)

165
00:09:17,240 --> 00:09:20,240
(The Chiyan Gang suffered
great losses because of me.)

166
00:09:20,240 --> 00:09:22,120
(Fu Yunzheng will never forgive me.)

167
00:09:23,160 --> 00:09:24,320
(How should I solve)

168
00:09:24,640 --> 00:09:26,000
(this situation?)

169
00:09:36,280 --> 00:09:37,160
Apply it yourself.

170
00:09:37,400 --> 00:09:39,200
I don't like things with scars.

171
00:09:43,720 --> 00:09:44,800
Fu Yunyue,

172
00:09:46,080 --> 00:09:47,640
I love seeing you

173
00:09:47,640 --> 00:09:50,400
wanting to kill me but being unable to.

174
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:11,920
Fu Yunzheng,

175
00:10:13,080 --> 00:10:14,480
what do you take me for?

176
00:10:16,480 --> 00:10:17,880
A woman is just a toy.

177
00:10:18,360 --> 00:10:20,280
I can play with you however I want.

178
00:10:21,680 --> 00:10:22,840
Why?

179
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:25,280
Why must you force me

180
00:10:26,200 --> 00:10:28,400
to exhaust the last bit of affection
for you?

181
00:10:30,320 --> 00:10:31,720
You talk to me about affection?

182
00:10:33,200 --> 00:10:34,000
Fu Yunyue,

183
00:10:34,480 --> 00:10:36,600
I'm your mother's killer.

184
00:10:37,880 --> 00:10:39,320
Do you know

185
00:10:39,320 --> 00:10:40,800
why your mom asked me

186
00:10:41,400 --> 00:10:42,920
to take care of you before she died?

187
00:10:45,200 --> 00:10:47,360
Because she was afraid I'd kill you too.

188
00:10:48,440 --> 00:10:49,600
It was she

189
00:10:49,600 --> 00:10:51,160
who delivered you

190
00:10:51,160 --> 00:10:52,680
into my hands

191
00:10:52,680 --> 00:10:54,440
for me to toy with.

192
00:10:56,800 --> 00:10:58,920
Shut up! Shut up! Shut up!

193
00:10:58,920 --> 00:11:00,360
Shut up!

194
00:11:00,360 --> 00:11:01,520
Miss Yue! Miss Yue!

195
00:11:02,320 --> 00:11:03,960
Sir Fu did this to make you kill him.

196
00:11:03,960 --> 00:11:04,480
Wei Zhan,

197
00:11:04,480 --> 00:11:05,080
shut up!

198
00:11:05,360 --> 00:11:06,760
Sir Fu intentionally made you suspect

199
00:11:06,760 --> 00:11:08,360
he's your mom's killer.

200
00:11:08,360 --> 00:11:10,320
He also intentionally tortured
and humiliated you.

201
00:11:10,640 --> 00:11:12,400
Only if you truly hate and kill him

202
00:11:12,400 --> 00:11:14,080
will the play be real.

203
00:11:14,080 --> 00:11:15,240
Only then will Master Shen believe.

204
00:11:17,120 --> 00:11:17,920
Shut up!

205
00:11:18,480 --> 00:11:19,280
Sir Fu,

206
00:11:20,080 --> 00:11:20,880
I can't stand by

207
00:11:20,880 --> 00:11:22,360
and watch you kill each other.

208
00:12:04,440 --> 00:12:06,400
You already knew.

209
00:12:16,360 --> 00:12:18,480
I didn't believe a word

210
00:12:19,760 --> 00:12:22,760
Master Shen said that day.

211
00:12:24,080 --> 00:12:26,600
(I just can't accept)

212
00:12:26,600 --> 00:12:29,520
(my dad is such a villain.)

213
00:12:30,360 --> 00:12:32,000
What you say is all lies.

214
00:12:32,640 --> 00:12:34,320
You can't be my dad.

215
00:12:34,320 --> 00:12:35,880
I'm not lying.

216
00:12:35,880 --> 00:12:36,480
Yue.

217
00:12:37,120 --> 00:12:37,920
Yue.

218
00:12:38,800 --> 00:12:40,320
But that day,

219
00:12:40,320 --> 00:12:42,240
in the ancestral hall,

220
00:12:42,240 --> 00:12:43,920
I discovered another secret.

221
00:12:46,080 --> 00:12:48,240
(The ledger we've been looking for)

222
00:12:48,880 --> 00:12:50,120
(is actually Master Shen's)

223
00:12:50,120 --> 00:12:51,920
(charity ledger.)

224
00:12:53,360 --> 00:12:55,880
(Every charity donation recorded)

225
00:12:55,880 --> 00:12:59,200
(is the fund for
his smuggling operation.)

226
00:12:59,200 --> 00:13:01,160
(The destination of the donation)

227
00:13:01,160 --> 00:13:03,640
(is the transaction record
of his goods.)

228
00:13:06,680 --> 00:13:08,640
(Based on the records,)

229
00:13:08,640 --> 00:13:10,240
(I determined)

230
00:13:10,240 --> 00:13:13,040
(he'll have a huge transaction
with the Japanese in three days.)

231
00:13:13,480 --> 00:13:14,840
After this deal,

232
00:13:15,120 --> 00:13:16,640
he plans to retire.

233
00:13:17,080 --> 00:13:19,440
It'll be difficult to catch him then.

234
00:13:20,680 --> 00:13:21,480
This time,

235
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:23,320
is our last and best chance

236
00:13:23,320 --> 00:13:25,480
to eliminate him.

237
00:13:28,960 --> 00:13:30,240
So,

238
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:32,640
you found

239
00:13:32,640 --> 00:13:34,440
he set a big trap

240
00:13:34,440 --> 00:13:36,160
and played along

241
00:13:36,640 --> 00:13:38,960
to get more information about this deal?

242
00:14:00,120 --> 00:14:01,120
Yue,

243
00:14:01,880 --> 00:14:02,880
he's cunning

244
00:14:02,880 --> 00:14:04,080
and deeply scheming.

245
00:14:06,160 --> 00:14:07,760
To gain his trust,

246
00:14:08,360 --> 00:14:09,800
doing these things isn't enough.

247
00:14:10,080 --> 00:14:11,960
I'm his biggest threat.

248
00:14:13,160 --> 00:14:14,640
Only by killing me,

249
00:14:14,640 --> 00:14:15,840
will he trust you.

250
00:14:18,400 --> 00:14:19,720
But...

251
00:14:21,440 --> 00:14:22,520
But...

252
00:14:24,680 --> 00:14:26,680
We're just one step away.

253
00:14:27,480 --> 00:14:29,280
Don't you want to avenge our mom?

254
00:14:36,480 --> 00:14:37,240
Shoot.

255
00:14:39,600 --> 00:14:40,520
No, Yunzheng.

256
00:14:40,880 --> 00:14:41,800
There must be another way.

257
00:14:41,800 --> 00:14:43,840
There must be another way, right?

258
00:14:46,160 --> 00:14:47,960
There must be another way!

259
00:14:50,200 --> 00:14:51,320
Sir Fu,

260
00:14:51,320 --> 00:14:53,040
Master Shen has led his men
into the Chiyan Gang.

261
00:14:53,480 --> 00:14:54,280
There is no time, shoot!

262
00:14:54,280 --> 00:14:54,720
No!

263
00:14:56,520 --> 00:14:57,000
No!

264
00:14:57,360 --> 00:14:58,120
Fu Yunzheng,

265
00:14:58,440 --> 00:14:59,720
hand over Yue!

266
00:15:00,160 --> 00:15:01,920
Or there'll be consequences!

267
00:15:02,760 --> 00:15:04,400
Fu Yunzheng, let go of my daughter.

268
00:15:07,280 --> 00:15:07,960
Fu Yunzheng,

269
00:15:09,200 --> 00:15:09,800
I'm telling you.

270
00:15:09,800 --> 00:15:10,440
Fu Yunzheng,

271
00:15:11,120 --> 00:15:12,360
if you release my daughter now,

272
00:15:12,560 --> 00:15:13,760
I won't tear you apart.

273
00:15:17,720 --> 00:15:18,120
Try it?

274
00:15:18,120 --> 00:15:18,720
Yue,

275
00:15:19,360 --> 00:15:20,960
don't be afraid. I'm here.

276
00:15:22,400 --> 00:15:23,000
Fu Yunzheng,

277
00:15:24,080 --> 00:15:24,840
let her go!

278
00:15:25,520 --> 00:15:26,240
Let her go!

279
00:15:28,240 --> 00:15:29,600
I beg you.

280
00:15:30,240 --> 00:15:31,280
Fu Yunzheng,

281
00:15:31,280 --> 00:15:32,000
don't be impulsive!

282
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:33,040
Everything is negotiable.

283
00:15:33,520 --> 00:15:34,280
Yue,

284
00:15:34,800 --> 00:15:35,560
don't be afraid.

285
00:15:39,280 --> 00:15:39,640
Yue!

286
00:15:39,920 --> 00:15:40,560
Go!

287
00:15:41,080 --> 00:15:41,720
Go after him!

288
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:44,960
Yue, are you alright?

289
00:15:47,080 --> 00:15:47,720
It's alright.

290
00:15:48,760 --> 00:15:50,120
It's alright.

291
00:15:50,920 --> 00:15:53,840
Quick, this way, block them!

292
00:16:04,840 --> 00:16:05,680
Master,

293
00:16:05,680 --> 00:16:07,040
we've captured him.

294
00:16:11,800 --> 00:16:13,280
Fu Yunzheng,

295
00:16:15,040 --> 00:16:16,760
you wretched dog.

296
00:16:16,760 --> 00:16:18,200
You wanted to harm my daughter?

297
00:16:26,440 --> 00:16:27,720
Yue,

298
00:16:28,600 --> 00:16:29,840
tell me,

299
00:16:30,360 --> 00:16:31,960
how should we deal with him?

300
00:16:47,880 --> 00:16:48,680
Miss Yue,

301
00:16:51,120 --> 00:16:52,520
don't disappoint Master Shen.

302
00:17:30,720 --> 00:17:31,800
Fu Yunyue,

303
00:17:32,640 --> 00:17:34,480
you've mistaken an enemy for your father

304
00:17:34,880 --> 00:17:35,920
and betrayed the Chiyan Gang.

305
00:17:35,920 --> 00:17:37,440
Even as a ghost, I won't spare you!

306
00:17:37,440 --> 00:17:38,680
Fu Yunzheng,

307
00:17:39,360 --> 00:17:41,240
you killed my mom

308
00:17:41,240 --> 00:17:43,640
and turned me against
my biological father.

309
00:17:44,160 --> 00:17:46,320
You're the one who deserves
to go to hell.
