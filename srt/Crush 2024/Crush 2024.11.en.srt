16

what happens if someone defies
our master.

17

Someone is coming.

18
00:01:25,480 --> 00:01:26,800
It must be Master Shen and his people.

19
00:01:28,520 --> 00:01:29,400
Someone is out.

20
00:01:29,400 --> 00:01:30,640
Fu Yunzheng is still alive.

21
00:01:39,240 --> 00:01:40,360
Sir Xize,

22
00:01:40,360 --> 00:01:41,760
why is it you?

23
00:01:58,000 --> 00:01:59,120
You should go.

24
00:01:59,120 --> 00:02:00,400
I want to be alone.

25
00:02:02,880 --> 00:02:03,880
It's all my fault

26
00:02:04,160 --> 00:02:05,360
for not protecting you well.

27
00:02:06,680 --> 00:02:07,520
Xize,

28
00:02:07,520 --> 00:02:08,560
it's not your fault.

29
00:02:09,280 --> 00:02:10,400
You're wonderful.

30
00:02:13,200 --> 00:02:14,400
But I really don't want

31
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:15,400
to become your stepmother.

32
00:02:16,280 --> 00:02:17,040
Moli,

33
00:02:17,240 --> 00:02:18,280
do you mean

34
00:02:18,640 --> 00:02:19,880
- my dad...
- Master Shen wanted to

35
00:02:19,880 --> 00:02:21,600
assault me a few times.

36
00:02:27,720 --> 00:02:29,120
I come from a humble background,

37
00:02:30,040 --> 00:02:32,000
but I'm a person of integrity.

38
00:02:33,200 --> 00:02:34,320
I'd rather die

39
00:02:34,320 --> 00:02:36,080
than suffer that humiliation.

40
00:02:37,080 --> 00:02:37,960
Moli,

41
00:02:38,240 --> 00:02:39,160
rest assured.

42
00:02:39,480 --> 00:02:40,800
I'll give you an explanation.

43
00:02:45,280 --> 00:02:46,600
Someone is coming.

44
00:02:47,040 --> 00:02:48,600
It must be Master Shen and his people.

45
00:02:48,600 --> 00:02:49,720
What should we do?

46
00:02:51,200 --> 00:02:52,520
Miss,

47
00:02:53,240 --> 00:02:54,480
it's me.

48
00:02:55,240 --> 00:02:56,440
Moli!

49
00:02:57,880 --> 00:02:58,720
Moli!

50
00:02:59,000 --> 00:02:59,760
Sir,

51
00:02:59,760 --> 00:03:01,360
- are you looking for this lady?
- Yes.

52
00:03:01,360 --> 00:03:02,320
You know where she is?

53
00:03:15,520 --> 00:03:17,000
Who told me

54
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:18,480
he saw clearly

55
00:03:19,640 --> 00:03:20,920
the prey was in the cage?

56
00:03:26,480 --> 00:03:27,560
Why do you keep hurting Moli

57
00:03:27,560 --> 00:03:28,960
over and over again?

58
00:03:31,560 --> 00:03:33,720
And why did you come here

59
00:03:34,520 --> 00:03:37,240
to shout at your dad for this woman?

60
00:03:37,240 --> 00:03:38,840
She's not an ordinary woman.

61
00:03:38,840 --> 00:03:41,040
She's the love of my life.

62
00:03:41,040 --> 00:03:43,120
I'll marry her and no one else.

63
00:03:43,120 --> 00:03:43,920
Shut up!

64
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:47,320
I'm telling you, Shen Xize.

65
00:03:49,040 --> 00:03:50,920
I won't allow

66
00:03:51,800 --> 00:03:52,640
an unvirtuous woman

67
00:03:52,640 --> 00:03:54,200
to enter our Shen family.

68
00:03:56,040 --> 00:03:56,800
Dad,

69
00:03:57,040 --> 00:03:58,560
don't you think I know the bad things

70
00:03:58,920 --> 00:03:59,920
you've done?

71
00:04:00,560 --> 00:04:02,480
Is the Shen family so respectable?

72
00:04:04,560 --> 00:04:05,160
Where to?

73
00:04:05,160 --> 00:04:05,920
Come back here!

74
00:04:10,040 --> 00:04:11,080
Listen to me, everyone.

75
00:04:11,200 --> 00:04:12,160
A month from now,

76
00:04:12,160 --> 00:04:13,400
I'll marry Miss Moli.

77
00:04:13,680 --> 00:04:14,760
From now on,

78
00:04:15,120 --> 00:04:16,480
she's the mistress of the Shen family.

79
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:18,240
Anyone who disrespects her

80
00:04:18,440 --> 00:04:19,840
is against me.

81
00:04:24,200 --> 00:04:25,240
Master! Hurry, someone!

82
00:04:25,240 --> 00:04:26,080
Master.

83
00:04:37,360 --> 00:04:37,920
Moli,

84
00:04:38,600 --> 00:04:39,440
I asked the servants

85
00:04:39,440 --> 00:04:40,240
to make soup for you.

86
00:04:43,400 --> 00:04:43,960
Thank you,

87
00:04:44,520 --> 00:04:45,080
but I'm good.

88
00:04:46,880 --> 00:04:48,280
Are you angry with me?

89
00:04:53,640 --> 00:04:54,160
I'm sorry.

90
00:04:55,200 --> 00:04:56,360
I announced our wedding date

91
00:04:56,880 --> 00:04:58,480
without your permission.

92
00:04:59,080 --> 00:05:00,200
I understand.

93
00:05:00,440 --> 00:05:01,840
You did it to protect me.

94
00:05:02,760 --> 00:05:04,160
I'm glad you understand my intentions.

95
00:05:04,520 --> 00:05:05,120
Moli,

96
00:05:05,120 --> 00:05:06,520
I sincerely want to marry you

97
00:05:06,520 --> 00:05:07,640
and to protect you for a lifetime.

98
00:05:11,360 --> 00:05:13,640
It's OK if you don't agree now.

99
00:05:14,280 --> 00:05:15,520
I'll wait for you.

100
00:05:16,840 --> 00:05:17,840
But I heard you fought

101
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:19,760
with your dad

102
00:05:20,680 --> 00:05:21,920
because of me.

103
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:24,040
It's not worth it

104
00:05:24,520 --> 00:05:25,560
for someone like me.

105
00:05:25,560 --> 00:05:26,920
If I think it's worth it, it is.

106
00:05:27,440 --> 00:05:27,920
Moli,

107
00:05:28,200 --> 00:05:29,720
my dad won't be at home recently.

108
00:05:30,520 --> 00:05:31,480
You can stay here

109
00:05:31,480 --> 00:05:32,360
and recuperate.

110
00:05:32,600 --> 00:05:33,880
No one will dare to bully you.

111
00:05:35,480 --> 00:05:36,960
Did you really fall out with your dad

112
00:05:36,960 --> 00:05:38,200
because of me?

113
00:05:38,720 --> 00:05:40,520
A shipment of his was hijacked,

114
00:05:40,520 --> 00:05:42,120
so he went out early this morning.

115
00:05:42,120 --> 00:05:43,920
He won't be back for a few weeks.

116
00:05:51,520 --> 00:05:52,840
(No Stealing)
Handle with care.

117
00:05:55,800 --> 00:05:56,840
Who is it?

118
00:05:59,560 --> 00:06:00,560
Miss Yue.

119
00:06:03,280 --> 00:06:04,320
Did you hijack

120
00:06:04,320 --> 00:06:05,280
Master Shen's goods?

121
00:06:05,880 --> 00:06:07,440
Sir Fu ordered us to.

122
00:06:07,960 --> 00:06:08,840
Master Shen has

123
00:06:08,840 --> 00:06:10,400
assaulted you repeatedly.

124
00:06:10,680 --> 00:06:12,160
He deserves some punishment.

125
00:06:13,240 --> 00:06:15,400
Now he's in a panic over this shipment,

126
00:06:15,800 --> 00:06:17,040
so you'll be safe, Miss Yue.

127
00:06:18,520 --> 00:06:19,680
Wei Zhan,

128
00:06:21,920 --> 00:06:22,960
you talk too much.

129
00:06:33,200 --> 00:06:34,240
Yunzheng,

130
00:06:34,240 --> 00:06:35,560
did you hear?

131
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:38,640
Shen Xize wants to marry me in a month.

132
00:06:39,800 --> 00:06:41,320
Should I agree or not?

133
00:06:41,320 --> 00:06:42,560
I disagree.

134
00:06:44,120 --> 00:06:46,040
But marrying into the Shen family

135
00:06:46,400 --> 00:06:48,800
will make it easier to get the ledger
from the ancestral hall.

136
00:06:49,200 --> 00:06:50,400
Withdraw now.

137
00:06:50,400 --> 00:06:52,200
Cut off all ties with Shen Xize.

138
00:06:52,200 --> 00:06:54,480
I'll have Wei Zhan send you
out of the city for a while.

139
00:06:54,480 --> 00:06:56,840
From now on, there will be
no Moli in Long City.

140
00:06:57,680 --> 00:06:59,400
But without the ledger,

141
00:06:59,400 --> 00:07:00,760
how can I avenge mom's death?

142
00:07:01,680 --> 00:07:03,600
Only by ruining him

143
00:07:03,600 --> 00:07:04,920
can I console mom's spirit in heaven.

144
00:07:04,920 --> 00:07:06,160
I'll find another way.

145
00:07:10,720 --> 00:07:12,640
Are you worried about me?

146
00:07:13,240 --> 00:07:15,160
You're worried I might be
in danger again?

147
00:07:16,440 --> 00:07:18,000
Mom's spirit in heaven

148
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:19,520
wouldn't want to see you

149
00:07:19,520 --> 00:07:21,360
sacrificing your lifelong happiness
for revenge.

150
00:07:21,520 --> 00:07:22,400
What about you?

151
00:07:23,200 --> 00:07:25,320
Would you want to see me
marry another man?

152
00:07:47,120 --> 00:07:48,160
Yunzheng,

153
00:07:48,480 --> 00:07:50,840
do you know what day it is today?

154
00:07:53,320 --> 00:07:54,720
Today is the Winter Solstice.

155
00:07:55,480 --> 00:07:58,200
Every year on the Winter Solstice,
you take me to the market.

156
00:07:58,920 --> 00:08:00,200
Will you take me this year too?

157
00:08:01,080 --> 00:08:02,040
Alright,

158
00:08:02,560 --> 00:08:04,400
I know what you want to say.

159
00:08:05,400 --> 00:08:07,720
Tonight I'm just Fu Yunyue,

160
00:08:07,720 --> 00:08:09,920
and you're just Fu Yunzheng.

161
00:08:09,920 --> 00:08:12,480
Let's not think about anything else
for now.

162
00:08:14,360 --> 00:08:15,440
Let's go.

163
00:08:16,160 --> 00:08:17,160
Come on.

164
00:08:41,600 --> 00:08:42,720
Candied haws.

165
00:08:56,560 --> 00:08:57,800
You're a grown-up.

166
00:09:01,200 --> 00:09:03,120
You still get food on the corner
of your mouth.

167
00:09:08,400 --> 00:09:10,000
It's gone now.

168
00:09:17,880 --> 00:09:18,800
Is it sweet?

169
00:09:51,980 --> 00:09:54,720
♪On cold nights, I often ride on dreams♪

170
00:09:54,860 --> 00:09:57,460

♪Just like vows of love,

175
00:10:37,080 --> 00:10:37,840
Fu Yunzheng,

176
00:10:38,520 --> 00:10:39,400
if only we were

177
00:10:39,400 --> 00:10:41,160
the only ones left in the world.

178
00:10:41,160 --> 00:10:42,120
What's good about that?

179
00:10:43,640 --> 00:10:46,360
Then we wouldn't have to care
about others' opinions.

180
00:10:47,360 --> 00:10:49,160
We could live freely

181
00:10:50,360 --> 00:10:52,640
and embrace each other

182
00:10:52,640 --> 00:10:53,880
without hesitation.

183
00:11:04,600 --> 00:11:06,560
Don't say such unrealistic things.

184
00:11:09,480 --> 00:11:10,480
So boring.

185
00:11:14,560 --> 00:11:16,880
Then dance with me.

186
00:11:17,280 --> 00:11:18,240
Is that OK?

187
00:11:19,160 --> 00:11:19,920
Here?

188
00:11:19,920 --> 00:11:21,560
Just the two of us.

189
00:11:23,600 --> 00:11:25,480
But there's no music, how can we dance?

190
00:11:27,040 --> 00:11:28,360
Hum a tune,

191
00:11:28,360 --> 00:11:29,600
just like you did

192
00:11:29,600 --> 00:11:32,200
when you sang me to sleep
as a child.

Lanterns for sale!

205
00:12:43,640 --> 00:12:44,720
Sir,

206
00:12:44,720 --> 00:12:46,800
buy a lantern for your girlfriend.

207
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:51,440
I'm not his girlfriend.

208
00:12:55,920 --> 00:12:56,800
Keep the change.

209
00:12:58,760 --> 00:13:00,240
Thank you, sir.

210
00:13:01,440 --> 00:13:04,160
Lanterns.

211
00:13:05,640 --> 00:13:06,400
Let's go.

212
00:13:30,760 --> 00:13:31,760
What did you wish for?

213
00:13:33,400 --> 00:13:34,640
I wish

214
00:13:34,640 --> 00:13:36,200
Yue to always be happy

215
00:13:36,680 --> 00:13:37,840
and safe,

216
00:13:37,840 --> 00:13:39,200
and...

217
00:13:45,360 --> 00:13:46,120
What else?

218
00:13:46,880 --> 00:13:47,680
Say it.

219
00:13:51,200 --> 00:13:52,240
Didn't you tell me

220
00:13:52,240 --> 00:13:53,440
saying it makes it not come true?

221
00:13:54,200 --> 00:13:57,000
That doesn't apply to family.

222
00:13:57,000 --> 00:13:57,680
Say it.

223
00:13:57,680 --> 00:13:59,160
Rules are rules.

224
00:13:59,160 --> 00:14:00,600
It doesn't matter
if it's family or not.

225
00:14:02,120 --> 00:14:03,080
Old-fashioned.

226
00:14:04,640 --> 00:14:05,800
River god,

227
00:14:05,800 --> 00:14:07,320
I want to change my wish.

228
00:14:07,320 --> 00:14:08,840
I wish for Fu Yunzheng

229
00:14:08,840 --> 00:14:10,320
to speak his true feelings.

230
00:14:12,160 --> 00:14:13,880
(He has a bit of love for me,)

231
00:14:13,880 --> 00:14:14,720
(doesn't he?)

232
00:14:18,160 --> 00:14:19,520
(My third wish)

233
00:14:20,440 --> 00:14:21,960
(is for us to be together)

234
00:14:21,960 --> 00:14:24,320
(for all lifetimes.)

235
00:14:25,240 --> 00:14:27,160
(But what's the use of saying it)

236
00:14:27,800 --> 00:14:29,240
(if the wish can't come true?)

237
00:14:42,760 --> 00:14:43,560
Sir Fu,

238
00:14:43,560 --> 00:14:44,320
have you eaten?

239
00:15:54,400 --> 00:15:55,320
Yunzheng,

240
00:15:56,840 --> 00:15:58,040
are the candied haws delicious?

241
00:15:59,080 --> 00:16:00,240
Why are you here?

242
00:16:01,840 --> 00:16:03,800
Someone brought you candied haws.

243
00:16:03,800 --> 00:16:05,480
I can't fall behind,

244
00:16:06,040 --> 00:16:06,920
so

245
00:16:06,920 --> 00:16:08,680
I prepared a gift for you too.

246
00:16:20,480 --> 00:16:21,240
Is it pretty?

247
00:16:22,920 --> 00:16:24,120
To tell the truth,

248
00:16:24,120 --> 00:16:26,440
when I first saw it,
I was also startled.

249
00:16:27,560 --> 00:16:29,040
I thought

250
00:16:29,040 --> 00:16:30,800
you had an affair
with my brother's fiancée.

251
00:16:31,560 --> 00:16:32,600
But it turns out

252
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:34,760
Moli's true identity

253
00:16:35,120 --> 00:16:36,480
is Fu Yunyue.

254
00:16:37,120 --> 00:16:38,880
You're actually siblings.

255
00:16:39,760 --> 00:16:41,360
It's none of your business.

256
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:47,440
Is it deep sibling affection
between you two

257
00:16:48,600 --> 00:16:50,040
or is it romantic love?

258
00:16:50,880 --> 00:16:52,800
I think my dad would be
interested to know.
