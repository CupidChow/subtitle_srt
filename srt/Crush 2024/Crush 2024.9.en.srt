I'm going to the restroom.

Excuse me for a moment.

22
00:02:21,120 --> 00:02:22,280
Why did you agree to his proposal

23
00:02:22,280 --> 00:02:23,600
without discussing it with me?

24
00:02:24,360 --> 00:02:25,200
Are you jealous?

00:02:25,200 --> 00:02:26,480
You broke your promise.

26
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:28,120
So did you.

27
00:02:28,120 --> 00:02:29,160
I learned it from you.

If Shen Zhiwei sees us,

29
00:02:35,960 --> 00:02:37,400
it won't be easy

30
00:02:37,400 --> 00:02:38,640
to explain it to her.

31
00:02:38,640 --> 00:02:40,920
Break up with Shen Xize now.

32
00:02:44,440 --> 00:02:46,800
Are you ordering me as my brother

33
00:02:47,560 --> 00:02:50,440
or as a man?

34
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:52,080
What's the difference?

35
00:02:53,520 --> 00:02:54,600
You know the answer.

36
00:03:10,960 --> 00:03:12,120
Since it's still early,

37
00:03:12,600 --> 00:03:14,160
I wonder if this beautiful lady

38
00:03:14,520 --> 00:03:15,440
would honor me

39
00:03:15,440 --> 00:03:16,640
with a walk?

40
00:03:19,240 --> 00:03:19,960
Sure.

Miss Shen,

43
00:03:47,600 --> 00:03:48,800
Sir Fu is busy with work.

44
00:03:48,800 --> 00:03:49,600
You can't enter.

45
00:03:49,600 --> 00:03:50,400
Hey!

46
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:51,160
Surprised?

47
00:03:54,520 --> 00:03:55,920
Why are you here?

48
00:03:55,920 --> 00:03:57,320
I just sent you home.

49
00:03:57,320 --> 00:03:58,240
Am I not welcome?

50
00:04:02,640 --> 00:04:03,720
I'm busy right now.

51
00:04:04,280 --> 00:04:05,320
I don't have time for you.

52
00:04:08,280 --> 00:04:10,080
But you haven't started working yet.

53
00:04:10,680 --> 00:04:12,320
Why are you so eager to kick me out?

54
00:04:13,640 --> 00:04:14,880
I'm worried

55
00:04:14,880 --> 00:04:16,160
your family might be concerned.

56
00:04:16,320 --> 00:04:17,200
Concerned?

57
00:04:21,400 --> 00:04:22,400
Concerned about what?

58
00:04:23,160 --> 00:04:24,320
Concerned

59
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:26,280
you might eat me up?

60
00:04:27,640 --> 00:04:28,920
I'll have Wei Zhan send you home.

61
00:04:29,960 --> 00:04:31,720
I haven't even had a cup of tea yet.

62
00:04:32,880 --> 00:04:34,080
Wei Zhan!

63
00:04:34,080 --> 00:04:35,280
Yes, Sir Fu?

64
00:04:36,360 --> 00:04:37,520
Pack some Biluochun tea

65
00:04:37,520 --> 00:04:38,760

66
00:04:40,600 --> 00:04:41,400

113
00:08:36,760 --> 00:08:37,560
No need.

114
00:08:39,040 --> 00:08:41,160
This is a new favorite
of the foreigners.

115
00:08:42,080 --> 00:08:43,680
I specially bought it for you to try.

116
00:08:44,280 --> 00:08:45,840
Miss Shen, if you have something to say,

117
00:08:45,840 --> 00:08:46,920
just say it.

118
00:08:48,280 --> 00:08:49,800
After all, this is the Shen family.

119
00:08:49,800 --> 00:08:50,960
We're sister-in-laws.

120
00:08:50,960 --> 00:08:52,440
There's no need to be so distant.

121
00:08:53,800 --> 00:08:55,240
I'm dependent on others.

122
00:08:55,240 --> 00:08:56,720
I should indeed be grateful.

123
00:08:58,040 --> 00:08:59,080
You're too polite.

124
00:08:59,680 --> 00:09:00,960
About what happened before,

125
00:09:00,960 --> 00:09:02,320
it was my fault.

126
00:09:02,320 --> 00:09:03,240
I apologize.

127
00:09:06,280 --> 00:09:07,400
No need for apologies.

128
00:09:07,800 --> 00:09:09,000
I just hope

129
00:09:09,440 --> 00:09:10,720
the same thing

130
00:09:10,720 --> 00:09:12,120
won't happen again.

131
00:09:14,960 --> 00:09:15,960
Of course.

132
00:09:16,440 --> 00:09:18,320
We'll be living together

133
00:09:18,320 --> 00:09:19,640
for a long time.

134
00:09:25,920 --> 00:09:27,600
Are you so guarded

135
00:09:27,600 --> 00:09:29,280
because you're afraid
I'll poison the coffee?

136
00:09:30,400 --> 00:09:31,560
I'm Chinese.

137
00:09:31,840 --> 00:09:33,040
I'm not used to it.

138
00:09:33,280 --> 00:09:34,680
I knew you wouldn't drink

139
00:09:34,680 --> 00:09:35,880
anything I offer.

140
00:09:36,880 --> 00:09:38,080
Otherwise, you'd have

141
00:09:39,080 --> 00:09:41,200
tasted the antidote.

142
00:09:48,320 --> 00:09:49,600
What have you done this time?

143
00:09:50,400 --> 00:09:52,240
How do you like

144
00:09:55,680 --> 00:09:56,440
my new incense?

145
00:10:01,640 --> 00:10:03,000
I want to see

146
00:10:04,120 --> 00:10:06,040

Master,

149
00:10:13,480 --> 00:10:16,360
Miss Zhiwei said she has a gift for you.

150
00:10:18,720 --> 00:10:20,520
- Master, take it slow.
- Alright.

151
00:10:43,200 --> 00:10:46,160
My daughter knows me well.

152
00:10:47,080 --> 00:10:48,640
