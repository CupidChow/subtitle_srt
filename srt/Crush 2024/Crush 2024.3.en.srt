00:01:17,120 --> 00:01:18,120
If you have the guts,

15
00:01:18,120 --> 00:01:19,360
lock me up for life.

16
00:01:21,080 --> 00:01:22,560
As you wish.

17
00:01:30,280 --> 00:01:31,360
Fu Yunzhen,

18
00:01:31,360 --> 00:01:32,520
you can't stop me.

19
00:01:32,960 --> 00:01:34,320
I'm not your caged bird.

20
00:01:34,320 --> 00:01:35,440
Then let's see

21
00:01:36,040 --> 00:01:37,600
how you escape from me.

22
00:01:41,080 --> 00:01:42,120
Sir Fu.

23
00:01:42,600 --> 00:01:43,560
Sir Fu.

24
00:02:00,200 --> 00:02:01,000
Sir Fu.

25
00:02:01,320 --> 00:02:02,080
Sir Fu.

26
00:02:17,720 --> 00:02:19,160
The pieces are already in play.

27
00:02:19,160 --> 00:02:20,720
Soon there will be a decisive strike,

28
00:02:20,720 --> 00:02:21,760
then checkmate.

29
00:02:22,200 --> 00:02:23,040
It's not enough.

30
00:02:25,120 --> 00:02:26,720
Send another gift.

31
00:02:29,480 --> 00:02:31,240
After all, you raised her up.

32
00:02:31,480 --> 00:02:32,600
Do you really want to do this?

33
00:02:48,800 --> 00:02:49,600
I'm tired.

34
00:02:50,200 --> 00:02:51,040
Let's sleep together.

35
00:03:08,840 --> 00:03:09,560
I'll sleep here,

36
00:03:09,800 --> 00:03:10,640
and you'll sleep there.

37
00:03:21,680 --> 00:03:22,480
What are you doing?

38
00:03:23,280 --> 00:03:24,600
How do I sleep without undressing?

39
00:03:52,840 --> 00:03:53,600
Oh no.

40
00:03:54,400 --> 00:03:55,720
I forgot to bring my pajamas.

41
00:04:02,240 --> 00:04:03,120
It's so cold, Yunzheng.

42
00:04:16,040 --> 00:04:18,480
Don't test my patience anymore.

43
00:04:18,480 --> 00:04:20,880
You treat me as your private property,

44
00:04:20,880 --> 00:04:22,880
not letting me get close to other men.

45
00:04:23,880 --> 00:04:26,080
But you don't respond
to my feelings either.

46
00:04:28,320 --> 00:04:30,280
You actually want me so much

47
00:04:30,840 --> 00:04:32,640
you're almost going crazy, right?

48
00:04:35,520 --> 00:04:36,800
You locked me up

49
00:04:38,280 --> 00:04:40,400
just for this moment, right?

50
00:05:15,600 --> 00:05:17,080
How do you know what I'm thinking?

51
00:05:21,520 --> 00:05:22,920
Just as you said,

52
00:05:23,720 --> 00:05:25,240
you've grown into a woman.

53
00:05:36,840 --> 00:05:37,960
Fu Yunzhen.

54
00:05:37,960 --> 00:05:39,760
Brother...

55
00:05:41,640 --> 00:05:43,040
Dare to provoke me again?

56
00:05:46,680 --> 00:05:48,920
Next time, use a better trick.

57
00:05:50,280 --> 00:05:51,400
Maybe,

58
00:05:51,400 --> 00:05:52,760
I'll consider changing the lock.

59
00:06:01,980 --> 00:06:04,420
(Chiyan Gang)

60
00:06:24,800 --> 00:06:25,560
Still up?

61
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:31,400
I was thinking about when we were young.

62
00:06:35,760 --> 00:06:37,280
After mom passed away,

63
00:06:38,440 --> 00:06:40,040
I'd often wake up crying,

64
00:06:41,640 --> 00:06:43,600
and you'd comfort me all night.

65
00:06:48,760 --> 00:06:50,760
Later, as the Chiyan Gang gradually

66
00:06:50,760 --> 00:06:52,880
established itself in Long City,

67
00:06:53,920 --> 00:06:55,320
you became busier and busier.

68
00:06:57,280 --> 00:06:59,160
I never thought after so many years,

69
00:07:00,800 --> 00:07:02,800
we'd share a bed again

70
00:07:03,280 --> 00:07:05,560
like this.

71
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:06,800
Yunzheng,

72
00:07:08,120 --> 00:07:09,200
can you

73
00:07:11,480 --> 00:07:13,240
comfort me to sleep one more time?

74
00:07:15,040 --> 00:07:15,960
Just think of it

75
00:07:18,040 --> 00:07:20,080
as my last wish.

76
00:07:25,920 --> 00:07:27,320
Yue.

77
00:07:39,720 --> 00:07:40,520
Yue.

78
00:07:40,960 --> 00:07:41,720
Yue.

79
00:07:47,600 --> 00:07:48,720
How about this trick?

80
00:07:49,040 --> 00:07:50,760
I bet you wouldn't dare let me get hurt.

81
00:07:50,760 --> 00:07:51,760
But I didn't expect

82
00:07:51,760 --> 00:07:53,000
the key to be on me.

83
00:07:53,400 --> 00:07:54,400
I'm free now.

84
00:08:10,120 --> 00:08:10,880
Get out.

85
00:08:13,760 --> 00:08:14,560
My luggage.

86
00:08:15,880 --> 00:08:17,800
My place can't accommodate
someone like you.

87
00:08:17,800 --> 00:08:19,120
Take your things and get out.

88
00:08:25,200 --> 00:08:25,760
Moli,

89
00:08:25,760 --> 00:08:27,000
what's going on?

90
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:28,000
Xize,

91
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:28,760
it's nothing.

92
00:08:30,400 --> 00:08:31,720
I took you in out of kindness

93
00:08:31,720 --> 00:08:32,960
because you had nowhere to go.

94
00:08:32,960 --> 00:08:34,960
I didn't expect you to bring me trouble.

95
00:08:35,320 --> 00:08:37,520
Those thugs come to the store every day.

96
00:08:38,040 --> 00:08:39,440
How am I supposed to do business?

97
00:08:40,600 --> 00:08:41,920
Didn't they say

98
00:08:41,920 --> 00:08:43,600
you saved that Sir Shen?

99
00:08:44,040 --> 00:08:45,000
Go find him.

100
00:08:46,920 --> 00:08:48,240
Have those people harassed you?

101
00:08:49,320 --> 00:08:50,080
No.

102
00:08:51,920 --> 00:08:52,960
It's not your concern.

103
00:08:53,760 --> 00:08:54,680
I didn't do my job well.

104
00:08:54,680 --> 00:08:55,880
That's my own problem.

105
00:08:56,280 --> 00:08:57,360
It has nothing to do with you.

106
00:08:57,880 --> 00:08:58,920
It's all my fault.

107
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:00,800
Come with me.

108
00:09:21,840 --> 00:09:22,400
Xize,

109
00:09:22,840 --> 00:09:24,320
I moved into your house all of a sudden.

110
00:09:24,320 --> 00:09:25,440
Isn't it too much trouble?

111
00:09:25,440 --> 00:09:26,360
You have nowhere to go

112
00:09:26,360 --> 00:09:27,320
because you saved me,

113
00:09:27,760 --> 00:09:28,880
so just stay here.

114
00:09:30,800 --> 00:09:31,480
Let's go.

115
00:09:55,360 --> 00:09:56,360
At the banquet,

116
00:09:56,360 --> 00:09:57,560
why did you leave suddenly?

117
00:09:57,880 --> 00:09:59,080
I was worried about you.

118
00:10:00,720 --> 00:10:02,080
For someone like me,

119
00:10:02,080 --> 00:10:03,320
I'm a burden wherever I go.

120
00:10:04,400 --> 00:10:06,120
I just didn't want
to trouble you anymore.

121
00:10:06,120 --> 00:10:07,240
How could that be?

122
00:10:08,040 --> 00:10:08,800
I...

123
00:10:10,080 --> 00:10:11,680
I want you to always trouble me.

124
00:10:16,440 --> 00:10:17,200
By the way,

125
00:10:17,680 --> 00:10:19,560
where will I stay?

126
00:10:20,640 --> 00:10:21,440
Over there?

127
00:10:22,680 --> 00:10:23,760
That's my dad's study.

128
00:10:24,600 --> 00:10:25,800
Outsiders can't enter.

129
00:10:26,200 --> 00:10:26,960
Oh.

130
00:10:28,520 --> 00:10:29,720
Since I've come to your house,

131
00:10:29,720 --> 00:10:30,880
shouldn't I pay respects

132
00:10:30,880 --> 00:10:31,760
to your father?

133
00:10:31,760 --> 00:10:32,920
Just to explain things.

134
00:10:33,800 --> 00:10:35,400
He has important guests today.

135
00:10:35,720 --> 00:10:36,800
Tomorrow I'll take you to him.

136
00:10:54,040 --> 00:10:55,040
Who would've thought

137
00:10:55,400 --> 00:10:57,080
the Governor and the Marshal

138
00:10:57,080 --> 00:10:58,400
were fighting each other?

139
00:10:59,680 --> 00:11:00,920
In the end, those weapons

140
00:11:01,280 --> 00:11:02,800
ended up in my hands.

141
00:11:04,600 --> 00:11:06,000
Come, cheers.

142
00:11:06,960 --> 00:11:07,480
Cheers.

143
00:11:16,240 --> 00:11:17,120
You have the supply,

144
00:11:17,720 --> 00:11:18,720
I have the sales channels,

145
00:11:19,560 --> 00:11:21,160
and he controls
the transportation routes.

146
00:11:21,640 --> 00:11:22,720
The three of us,

147
00:11:22,720 --> 00:11:24,600
we're a perfect team.

148
00:11:25,960 --> 00:11:26,920
Well said.

149
00:11:26,920 --> 00:11:27,880
A perfect team.

150
00:11:27,880 --> 00:11:28,800
Come, come.

151
00:11:28,800 --> 00:11:29,680
Let's get rich together.

152
00:11:52,440 --> 00:11:52,880
Who's there?

153
00:11:53,560 --> 00:11:54,240
Someone!

154
00:11:54,520 --> 00:11:56,600
A thief broke into the house
and you didn't know?

155
00:12:21,320 --> 00:12:21,960
Master Shen,

156
00:12:22,120 --> 00:12:22,920
we didn't find him.

157
00:12:26,760 --> 00:12:28,360
You useless people.

158
00:12:28,360 --> 00:12:28,840
Alright.

159
00:12:30,440 --> 00:12:31,400
Recently,

160
00:12:31,400 --> 00:12:33,160
has anyone come to the house?

161
00:12:33,520 --> 00:12:35,280
Sir Xize brought a friend home today.

162
00:12:52,520 --> 00:12:53,480
Who is it?

163
00:13:10,680 --> 00:13:11,720
You...

164
00:13:12,640 --> 00:13:13,720
are Moli.

165
00:13:14,240 --> 00:13:14,960
Master Shen,

166
00:13:16,040 --> 00:13:17,240
why did you come to my room?

167
00:13:21,560 --> 00:13:22,360
Don't be afraid.

168
00:13:23,560 --> 00:13:25,520
Since you're Xize's friend,

169
00:13:27,360 --> 00:13:29,440
just call me uncle.

170
00:13:30,760 --> 00:13:31,960
Uncle Shen,

171
00:13:31,960 --> 00:13:34,000
what are you doing in my room so late?

172
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:35,040
Tonight,

173
00:13:35,640 --> 00:13:37,360
a thief entered the Shen household.

174
00:13:37,800 --> 00:13:39,200
I came specially to take a look.

175
00:13:39,480 --> 00:13:40,560
A thief?

176
00:13:41,400 --> 00:13:42,440
What should we do then?

177
00:13:42,440 --> 00:13:43,200
Don't worry.

178
00:13:43,440 --> 00:13:44,560
With me here,

179
00:13:47,040 --> 00:13:48,120
the thief

180
00:13:48,120 --> 00:13:49,440
won't get away.

181
00:13:54,760 --> 00:13:55,400
Master,

182
00:13:55,880 --> 00:13:57,200
we've found a man in black.

183
00:13:59,280 --> 00:13:59,880
Don't be afraid.

184
00:14:00,600 --> 00:14:01,320
Don't be afraid.

185
00:14:06,520 --> 00:14:07,320
Let's go.

186
00:14:22,600 --> 00:14:23,360
Come out.

187
00:14:38,360 --> 00:14:39,720
Are you here to deliver yourself

188
00:14:39,720 --> 00:14:41,360
so he could take advantage of you?

189
00:14:56,040 --> 00:14:58,120
Did you send someone
to lure Master Shen away?

190
00:14:59,640 --> 00:15:01,000
If it weren't for you just now,

191
00:15:01,760 --> 00:15:03,040
I'd have succeeded.

192
00:15:05,440 --> 00:15:07,080
Do you think you can kill him

193
00:15:07,760 --> 00:15:09,160
with such a petty trick?

194
00:15:12,920 --> 00:15:15,080
That's still better than someone

195
00:15:18,160 --> 00:15:19,760
teaming up with him in disgrace.

196
00:15:28,240 --> 00:15:29,240
Did you hear anything?

197
00:15:31,720 --> 00:15:33,720
I saw the person I trusted most

198
00:15:35,280 --> 00:15:37,240
turn into a man-eating ghost.

199
00:15:38,840 --> 00:15:39,680
Fu Yunzheng,

200
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:42,560
what did you promise mom?

201
00:15:43,440 --> 00:15:45,320
You'd never smuggle in this life.

202
00:15:46,200 --> 00:15:47,960
But what did you do?

203
00:15:49,360 --> 00:15:51,040
Colluding with enemies

204
00:15:51,040 --> 00:15:52,320
and engaging in smuggling.

205
00:16:02,080 --> 00:16:03,200
You should know

206
00:16:04,080 --> 00:16:06,120
the best way to keep a secret

207
00:16:06,560 --> 00:16:07,840
is through death.

208
00:16:08,840 --> 00:16:10,240
Then kill me.

209
00:16:12,240 --> 00:16:14,040
Otherwise, I won't give up
seeking revenge.

210
00:16:21,320 --> 00:16:22,720
This safety button

211
00:16:25,040 --> 00:16:26,760
represents the promise you made to mom.

212
00:16:28,880 --> 00:16:31,120
Now that promise is broken,

213
00:16:31,120 --> 00:16:32,360
all debts are settled

214
00:16:34,440 --> 00:16:35,920
between you and me.
