Yunzheng.

16
00:01:40,320 --> 00:01:40,960
Yunzheng,

17
00:01:40,960 --> 00:01:41,720
don't kill him.

18
00:01:41,960 --> 00:01:43,840
Killing him would ruin everything
we've worked for.

19
00:01:44,160 --> 00:01:45,880
Killing him now is too easy for him.

20
00:02:01,800 --> 00:02:02,600
Yunzheng,

21
00:02:03,560 --> 00:02:05,480
what if I had really been assaulted
just now?

22
00:02:05,480 --> 00:02:06,480
That would never happen.

23
00:02:07,840 --> 00:02:09,960
But marrying him as his concubine

24
00:02:10,280 --> 00:02:12,320
would make it easier to enter
the ancestral hall.

25
00:02:13,680 --> 00:02:14,560
That's not the only way

26
00:02:14,560 --> 00:02:15,880
to get the ledger.

27
00:02:17,840 --> 00:02:18,760
Yunzheng,

28
00:02:19,400 --> 00:02:20,320
are you afraid

29
00:02:20,320 --> 00:02:21,920
I'll become someone else's wife?

30
00:02:24,200 --> 00:02:25,320
You need to rest.

31
00:02:26,360 --> 00:02:27,120
Yunzheng,

32
00:02:27,760 --> 00:02:28,680
don't leave.

33
00:02:29,080 --> 00:02:30,000
I'm scared

34
00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:31,040
to sleep alone.

35
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:35,800
I've arranged for people to protect you.

36
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:38,120
They can protect my safety,

37
00:02:38,880 --> 00:02:40,680
but they can't drive away my nightmares.

38
00:02:46,560 --> 00:02:47,280
I'll stay with you.

39
00:02:48,960 --> 00:02:50,000
But what if I can't

40
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:51,480
fall asleep for a while?

41
00:02:53,560 --> 00:02:54,720
I'll stay with you the whole time.

42
00:03:18,480 --> 00:03:20,000
I won't fall in love with anyone else.

43
00:03:22,280 --> 00:03:23,960
You shouldn't like
anyone else either,

44
00:03:23,960 --> 00:03:25,160
OK?

45
00:04:08,920 --> 00:04:09,720
Slowly.

46
00:04:16,960 --> 00:04:17,560
Miss?

47
00:04:21,480 --> 00:04:22,640
All of you, get out!

48
00:04:22,640 --> 00:04:24,840
Get out!

49
00:04:27,120 --> 00:04:27,720
Dad?

50
00:04:28,680 --> 00:04:29,280
Zhiwei?

51
00:04:31,480 --> 00:04:32,200
Dad.

52
00:04:32,480 --> 00:04:33,160
I...

53
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:39,560
Zhiwei...

54
00:04:53,440 --> 00:04:54,560
Master,

55
00:04:56,120 --> 00:04:57,120
you wouldn't really...

56
00:04:57,120 --> 00:04:57,840
With Miss Zhiwei...

57
00:04:57,840 --> 00:04:58,600
Shut up!

58
00:04:59,040 --> 00:05:00,240
I was drunk,

59
00:05:00,240 --> 00:05:01,240
not stupid.

60
00:05:02,240 --> 00:05:02,920
I'm telling you,

61
00:05:03,520 --> 00:05:04,200
if anyone dares

62
00:05:04,840 --> 00:05:05,880
to gossip about this,

63
00:05:06,640 --> 00:05:07,840
I'll cut their tongue out.

64
00:05:08,720 --> 00:05:09,800
Yes, master.

65
00:05:10,840 --> 00:05:12,080
Have some soup

66
00:05:12,080 --> 00:05:12,680
to sober up.

67
00:05:12,680 --> 00:05:13,760
Take it away! I don't want it.

68
00:05:14,200 --> 00:05:15,400
You useless bunch.

69
00:05:15,800 --> 00:05:16,800
I got tricked

70
00:05:16,800 --> 00:05:18,000
in my own house.

71
00:05:19,840 --> 00:05:20,600
Master,

72
00:05:22,280 --> 00:05:24,000
did you see who it was?

73
00:05:24,720 --> 00:05:25,240
Of course not.

74
00:05:30,680 --> 00:05:32,360
I have a plan

75
00:05:32,800 --> 00:05:34,040
to catch that person.

76
00:05:34,800 --> 00:05:35,400
What is it?

77
00:05:36,720 --> 00:05:38,000
That person attacked you

78
00:05:38,520 --> 00:05:40,480
to rescue Miss Moli, right?

79
00:05:41,160 --> 00:05:42,320
If Miss Moli

80
00:05:42,320 --> 00:05:43,520
gets into trouble again,

81
00:05:44,520 --> 00:05:45,960
won't that person show up?

82
00:06:02,280 --> 00:06:03,360
Sir Shen, please come in.

83
00:06:10,680 --> 00:06:11,280

Xize,

88
00:06:17,760 --> 00:06:19,320
I really have enough clothes.

89
00:06:19,320 --> 00:06:20,440
No need to buy more.

90
00:06:20,720 --> 00:06:22,240
I just think you don't have enough.

91
00:06:23,680 --> 00:06:24,760
These all suit you.

92
00:06:24,760 --> 00:06:25,560
Go try them on.

93
00:08:25,880 --> 00:08:26,920

100
00:09:17,280 --> 00:09:19,560

101
00:09:25,360 --> 00:09:26,240
Good.

102
00:09:36,080 --> 00:09:37,040
Did you see clearly?

103
00:09:37,440 --> 00:09:38,880
Was it really Fu Yunzheng?

104
00:09:38,880 --> 00:09:40,920
Absolutely, it was definitely him.

105
00:09:43,600 --> 00:09:44,840
Fu Yunzheng

106
00:09:45,200 --> 00:09:46,200
is cunning.

107
00:09:46,480 --> 00:09:48,840
He's slipped away many times.

108
00:09:51,400 --> 00:09:52,400
A normal person

109
00:09:52,400 --> 00:09:54,360
would be dead after an hour

110
00:09:54,360 --> 00:09:55,360
in the ice cellar.

111
00:09:56,080 --> 00:09:57,720
Let's keep them there a bit longer.

112
00:09:58,600 --> 00:10:00,240
Even a fierce tiger

113
00:10:00,840 --> 00:10:02,200
can't do anything once it's trapped.

114
00:10:02,200 --> 00:10:04,880
Then we'll catch him in our trap,

115
00:10:04,880 --> 00:10:06,160
killing two birds with one stone.

116
00:10:09,280 --> 00:10:10,160
It's a good plan,

117
00:10:12,720 --> 00:10:14,080
