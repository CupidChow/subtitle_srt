55

was once your brother

whom you grew up with.

00:04:42,240 --> 00:04:43,240
But that said,

63
00:04:44,400 --> 00:04:45,240
you killed Fu Yunzheng

64
00:04:45,240 --> 00:04:46,360
for me.

65
00:04:46,880 --> 00:04:47,880
I'm very gratified.

66
00:04:53,320 --> 00:04:53,880
Dad,

67
00:04:58,240 --> 00:04:59,680
this is what I should do.

68
00:05:00,840 --> 00:05:01,840
It's all in the past now.

69
00:05:03,360 --> 00:05:04,520
You've done a great service

70
00:05:04,520 --> 00:05:05,760
for our Shen family.

71
00:05:05,760 --> 00:05:07,960
Whatever you want, just tell me.

72
00:05:10,800 --> 00:05:11,840
I don't want a reward.

73
00:05:12,840 --> 00:05:13,840
I just want to learn

74
00:05:13,840 --> 00:05:15,080
some business tricks,

75
00:05:15,800 --> 00:05:16,880
so I can stand firm.

76
00:05:17,200 --> 00:05:17,800
That's enough.

77
00:05:19,800 --> 00:05:21,120
Yue, don't worry.

78
00:05:21,880 --> 00:05:23,080
The Shen family business

79
00:05:23,080 --> 00:05:25,000
will eventually be handed over to you.

80
00:05:25,640 --> 00:05:27,160
First, take care of yourself.

81
00:05:29,160 --> 00:05:29,760
Very soon,

82
00:05:30,680 --> 00:05:32,120
there will be goods

83
00:05:32,640 --> 00:05:33,520
that need to be sent out.

84
00:05:33,520 --> 00:05:34,440
I've decided

85
00:05:34,440 --> 00:05:36,320
to let you come with me.

86
00:05:37,600 --> 00:05:38,640
Thank you for your trust, dad.

87
00:05:39,080 --> 00:05:40,280
Aren't you curious

88
00:05:41,600 --> 00:05:42,920
what goods are being shipped

89
00:05:43,480 --> 00:05:44,600
or who we're trading with?

90
00:05:46,040 --> 00:05:47,120
None of that matters.

91
00:05:47,800 --> 00:05:48,560
What matters is

92
00:05:49,680 --> 00:05:51,320
I only follow your orders.

93
00:05:52,200 --> 00:05:52,880
Good.

94
00:05:53,960 --> 00:05:55,840

95
00:05:57,600 --> 00:05:58,360
Alright.

96
00:05:58,760 --> 00:05:59,960
You should have some rest.

97
00:06:00,360 --> 00:06:00,920
Very soon,

98
00:06:01,760 --> 00:06:03,680
I'll take you to see the world.

105
00:06:40,840 --> 00:06:41,840

00:06:41,840 --> 00:06:42,600
Long time no see.

Yue,

113
00:06:52,680 --> 00:06:53,640
greet Mr. Kudo.

114

Mr. Kudo

116
00:07:07,160 --> 00:07:09,120
is an old friend of mine.

117
00:07:09,920 --> 00:07:11,320

118
00:07:12,400 --> 00:07:14,240

119
00:07:16,840 --> 00:07:17,640
Mr. Kudo,

120
00:07:18,200 --> 00:07:19,160

121

124
00:07:39,920 --> 00:07:41,000
please come with me.

Fu Yunyue,

126
00:07:57,320 --> 00:07:58,600
you colluded with outsiders

127
00:07:58,600 --> 00:07:59,560
to harm me.

128
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:03,040
Master Shen,

129
00:08:03,400 --> 00:08:04,600
I'm honored

130
00:08:04,600 --> 00:08:05,640
to have deceived you.

131
00:08:06,320 --> 00:08:07,040
Fu...

132
00:08:08,080 --> 00:08:09,200
Fu Yunzheng!

134
00:08:14,560 --> 00:08:16,280
(Master Shen has led people
into the Chiyan Gang.)

135
00:08:16,280 --> 00:08:17,560
There is no time, shoot!

136
00:08:19,080 --> 00:08:20,080
No!

137
00:08:24,440 --> 00:08:26,520
I have an idea!

138
00:08:27,440 --> 00:08:28,160
Yunzheng,

139
00:08:28,160 --> 00:08:29,280
find a way

140
00:08:29,280 --> 00:08:30,840
to lure Master Shen to the mass grave.

141
00:08:36,040 --> 00:08:36,760
Sir Fu!

142
00:08:44,600 --> 00:08:45,240
Sir Fu,

143
00:08:45,600 --> 00:08:46,480
are you alright?

144
00:08:46,840 --> 00:08:48,000
Did the bullet hurt you?

145
00:08:54,360 --> 00:08:55,600
Nice shot.

146
00:08:57,680 --> 00:08:59,160
Thanks to my good teaching.

147
00:09:02,080 --> 00:09:03,480
Why didn't you come a little later?

148
00:09:04,240 --> 00:09:05,440
You want to wait until I'm dead?

149
00:09:11,640 --> 00:09:12,360
Yue,

150
00:09:12,960 --> 00:09:14,280
don't believe him.

151
00:09:15,440 --> 00:09:16,400
It's that animal

152
00:09:16,400 --> 00:09:17,600
who killed your mom.

153
00:09:17,600 --> 00:09:19,520
You're the one that's an animal.

154
00:09:26,160 --> 00:09:26,720
Mom,

155
00:09:27,640 --> 00:09:28,520
the medicine is here.

156
00:09:32,920 --> 00:09:33,640
Mom,

157
00:09:33,640 --> 00:09:34,840
I asked the doctor.

158
00:09:34,840 --> 00:09:36,040
Western medicine is strong.

159
00:09:36,040 --> 00:09:37,960
We need to make sure
you're not allergic.

160
00:10:02,480 --> 00:10:03,160
Mom,

161
00:10:03,160 --> 00:10:04,720
are you allergic?

162
00:10:06,040 --> 00:10:07,040
I'll go find the doctor.

163
00:10:12,840 --> 00:10:14,240
You little brat.

164
00:10:15,400 --> 00:10:17,160
Dare to steal from me?

165
00:10:17,640 --> 00:10:19,200
I'll kill you.

166
00:10:19,200 --> 00:10:19,960
Bastard!

167
00:10:21,560 --> 00:10:23,560
Mom! Mom!

168
00:10:27,680 --> 00:10:29,000
Well, well.

169
00:10:29,320 --> 00:10:31,320
It's you, you cheap woman.

170
00:10:31,320 --> 00:10:32,320
Don't you dare insult my mom!

171
00:10:32,680 --> 00:10:33,320
Get lost.

172
00:10:39,480 --> 00:10:40,120
Wicked woman,

173
00:10:40,400 --> 00:10:42,520
I'll kill both you and your son!

174
00:11:04,760 --> 00:11:05,560
Let go!

175
00:11:06,280 --> 00:11:07,320
Let go!

176
00:11:07,920 --> 00:11:09,080
Let go!

177
00:11:40,480 --> 00:11:41,120
Yue!

178
00:11:41,600 --> 00:11:42,400
Yue!

179
00:11:42,400 --> 00:11:43,240
Don't kill me, Yue.

180
00:11:43,240 --> 00:11:44,360
I'm your father.

181
00:11:45,200 --> 00:11:46,560
Even if I lied to you,

182
00:11:47,800 --> 00:11:49,360
I'm still your biological father.

183
00:11:49,360 --> 00:11:51,280
Your mother and I had true feelings.

184
00:11:51,280 --> 00:11:51,880
Yue,

185
00:11:53,560 --> 00:11:54,360
besides,

186
00:11:54,600 --> 00:11:55,520
you don't want to be

187
00:11:56,160 --> 00:11:57,840
a patricide, do you?

188
00:11:57,840 --> 00:11:58,480
Shut up!

189
00:11:58,920 --> 00:12:00,200
I've already investigated.

190
00:12:00,200 --> 00:12:01,000
It was you

191
00:12:01,440 --> 00:12:02,880
who lusted after my mom back then.

192
00:12:02,880 --> 00:12:04,040
You forced her,

193
00:12:04,200 --> 00:12:06,240
caused her to get pregnant
out of wedlock

194
00:12:06,240 --> 00:12:08,200
and left her with lifelong ailments.

195
00:12:08,840 --> 00:12:10,720
Even if you die a thousand times today,

196
00:12:10,720 --> 00:12:12,120
it wouldn't be enough
to atone for my mom.

197
00:12:17,720 --> 00:12:18,800
Wicked woman!

198
00:12:19,040 --> 00:12:19,920
Rascal!

199
00:12:20,800 --> 00:12:22,200
You're a lowly woman.

200
00:12:22,440 --> 00:12:23,880
So was your mom!

201
00:12:24,360 --> 00:12:26,160
A lowly woman gave birth to you.

202
00:12:26,440 --> 00:12:28,080
Shameless woman.

203
00:12:28,440 --> 00:12:29,600
You seduced Fu Yunzheng.

204
00:12:29,600 --> 00:12:30,600
He's your brother.

205
00:12:30,600 --> 00:12:31,440
Do you know that?

206
00:12:32,240 --> 00:12:33,160
You rascal.

207
00:12:33,160 --> 00:12:34,120
You seduced your brother.

208
00:12:34,920 --> 00:12:36,040
You two rascals.

209
00:12:41,080 --> 00:12:42,320
Mr. Kudo, hurry up.

210
00:12:48,440 --> 00:12:50,200
Yue, it's alright now.

211
00:12:58,120 --> 00:12:59,120
Sir Fu.

212
00:12:59,680 --> 00:13:01,240
Yunzheng!

213
00:13:01,720 --> 00:13:02,360
Yunzheng!

214
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:12,160
His old wounds haven't healed,

215
00:13:12,160 --> 00:13:13,120
and he has some new ones.

216
00:13:13,320 --> 00:13:14,880
He's very weak.

217
00:13:14,880 --> 00:13:17,000
He needs to rest in bed
for at least a month.

218
00:13:18,360 --> 00:13:19,240
Thank you, doctor.

219
00:13:40,440 --> 00:13:41,800
How many men do we have left?

220
00:13:45,040 --> 00:13:45,640
About 20.

221
00:13:50,280 --> 00:13:52,040
The Chiyan Gang suffered because of me.

222
00:13:53,920 --> 00:13:54,880
According to the rules,

223
00:13:55,600 --> 00:13:57,680
I should go to the Repentance Stage
to be punished.

224
00:13:57,680 --> 00:13:58,440
Absolutely not.

225
00:14:01,360 --> 00:14:02,120
Miss Yue.

226
00:14:06,360 --> 00:14:07,120
Miss Yue.

227
00:14:08,160 --> 00:14:08,960
Miss Yue.

228
00:14:09,720 --> 00:14:11,160
You were kept in the dark at that time.

229
00:14:11,160 --> 00:14:11,960
Wei Zhan,

230
00:14:13,320 --> 00:14:14,920
if we want the gang
to regain its former glory,

231
00:14:15,200 --> 00:14:16,760
we must follow the rules.

232
00:14:18,120 --> 00:14:18,920
Do it.

233
00:14:46,820 --> 00:14:50,100
(Chiyan Gang)

234
00:14:57,760 --> 00:14:58,360
Sir Fu.

235
00:14:58,880 --> 00:15:00,600
You're finally awake.

236
00:15:08,120 --> 00:15:09,520
You've been unconscious for a few days.

237
00:15:09,800 --> 00:15:11,360
The guys were all worried.

238
00:15:13,440 --> 00:15:14,600
Have you caught Kudo?

239
00:15:15,320 --> 00:15:16,080
We're still searching.

240
00:15:18,520 --> 00:15:19,840
I injured one of his legs.

241
00:15:20,560 --> 00:15:21,440
He can't run far.

242
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:23,120
Send more people.

243
00:15:23,480 --> 00:15:24,920
We must eliminate him quickly.

244
00:15:24,920 --> 00:15:25,680
Yes.

245
00:15:29,360 --> 00:15:30,280
Where's Yue?

246
00:15:32,880 --> 00:15:34,080
Miss Yue...

247
00:15:35,200 --> 00:15:36,880
She went to Shen's to clean up the mess.

248
00:15:40,920 --> 00:15:42,000
Send someone over

249
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:42,920
to bring her back.

250
00:15:43,320 --> 00:15:44,440
Well...

251
00:15:45,800 --> 00:15:47,280
Miss Yue said,

252
00:15:47,280 --> 00:15:48,960
now that the Shen family is in chaos,

253
00:15:49,400 --> 00:15:51,640
it's the best time
to take back our territory.

254
00:15:54,320 --> 00:15:55,680
She also asked me to tell you

255
00:15:56,520 --> 00:15:57,880
she'll be back in a few days.

256
00:15:57,880 --> 00:15:58,920
You should rest well.

257
00:16:25,960 --> 00:16:26,520
Sir Fu,

258
00:16:26,720 --> 00:16:27,880
the Shen family's properties

259
00:16:27,880 --> 00:16:29,160
have been cleared.

260
00:16:29,160 --> 00:16:30,720
You can review them at any time.

261
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:32,600
Isn't Miss Yue there?

262
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:34,520
It's fine as long as she is in charge.

263
00:16:34,520 --> 00:16:36,240
Miss Yue has been
on the Repentance Stage.

264
00:16:46,040 --> 00:16:47,000
Miss Yue said

265
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:47,880
she harmed our brothers

266
00:16:47,880 --> 00:16:48,680
and must be punished.

267
00:16:49,160 --> 00:16:50,080
She did nothing wrong.

268
00:16:50,320 --> 00:16:51,120
I'll take her place.

269
00:16:51,320 --> 00:16:52,080
Quick, release her.

270
00:16:57,320 --> 00:16:58,120
No.

271
00:16:58,720 --> 00:17:00,800
My punishment will be over
in half a day.

272
00:17:01,520 --> 00:17:02,920
Ending it early

273
00:17:03,200 --> 00:17:04,560
will worsen the punishment.

274
00:17:07,600 --> 00:17:08,520
Why are you so silly?

275
00:17:09,880 --> 00:17:11,280
Even for a minute or a second,

276
00:17:11,280 --> 00:17:12,440
I don't want you to suffer.

277
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:14,120
Since childhood,

278
00:17:14,120 --> 00:17:15,560
protecting you has been my only mission.

279
00:17:19,960 --> 00:17:21,800
He still has injuries.

280
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:27,040
I will take the rest

281
00:17:27,040 --> 00:17:28,000
of the punishment.

282
00:17:29,960 --> 00:17:31,360
Before the punishment starts,

283
00:17:31,360 --> 00:17:32,960
I have an announcement to make.

284
00:17:34,080 --> 00:17:35,040
Fu Yunyue

285
00:17:35,040 --> 00:17:36,920
is no longer my sister,

286
00:17:37,760 --> 00:17:39,200
but my wife.

287
00:17:39,760 --> 00:17:41,400
Her mistakes are my mistakes.

288
00:17:41,400 --> 00:17:43,200
Punishing her is punishing me.

289
00:17:43,840 --> 00:17:44,640

290
00:17:44,640 --> 00:17:45,640
