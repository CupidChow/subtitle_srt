(Chiyan Gang)

00:01:18,080 --> 00:01:18,920
Sir Fu has arrived.

16
00:01:22,640 --> 00:01:23,480
Sir Fu.

17
00:01:36,920 --> 00:01:37,560
Fu Yunzhen,

18
00:01:37,920 --> 00:01:39,200
how dare you

19
00:01:39,200 --> 00:01:40,280
kill Wang Hai?

20
00:01:40,760 --> 00:01:42,480
You've ruined
our Shen family's business,

21
00:01:42,480 --> 00:01:44,080
causing us great losses.

22
00:01:44,080 --> 00:01:45,200
What do you intend to do?

23
00:01:46,880 --> 00:01:48,080
A mere dog

24
00:01:48,080 --> 00:01:49,920
dares to bark at our Chiyan Gang?

25
00:01:54,280 --> 00:01:55,280
You...

26
00:02:05,080 --> 00:02:05,880
Fu Yunzhen,

27
00:02:07,280 --> 00:02:09,120
you killed my partner.

28
00:02:09,560 --> 00:02:12,040
You need to give me an explanation.

29
00:02:14,320 --> 00:02:15,000
Uncle,

30
00:02:16,440 --> 00:02:17,280
open your eyes and see

31
00:02:17,920 --> 00:02:19,680
who truly deserves to be your partner.

32
00:02:30,800 --> 00:02:32,480
Under the guise of partnership,

33
00:02:32,920 --> 00:02:34,320
Wang Hai was only
filling his own pocket.

34
00:02:35,440 --> 00:02:36,440
Uncle, why don't you calculate

35
00:02:37,420 --> 00:02:38,360
(Hefeng Bank)
how much profit

36
00:02:38,360 --> 00:02:40,680
(6,000 silver coins)
he embezzled from the Shen family?

37
00:02:44,400 --> 00:02:45,680
I helped the Shen family

38
00:02:45,680 --> 00:02:47,240
eliminate a traitor
feeding off you.

39
00:02:48,360 --> 00:02:49,760
How should the Shen family thank me?

40
00:02:52,560 --> 00:02:53,440
We'll get

41
00:02:53,440 --> 00:02:55,600
to the bottom of this matter.

42
00:02:56,960 --> 00:02:57,640
But

43
00:02:57,640 --> 00:02:58,560
Sir Fu,

44
00:02:58,960 --> 00:03:00,560
you only talk about others.

45
00:03:00,560 --> 00:03:02,720
Haven't you also been scheming
against the Shen family?

46
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:03,760
And

47
00:03:04,840 --> 00:03:06,040
your affair with Moli

48
00:03:06,880 --> 00:03:08,360
is unclear and suspicious.

49
00:03:13,800 --> 00:03:14,720
You've reminded me.

50
00:03:15,840 --> 00:03:17,560
Luckily, I saved her for Sir Xize.

51
00:03:18,680 --> 00:03:20,040
Otherwise, if he found out

52
00:03:20,040 --> 00:03:21,040
someone

53
00:03:21,160 --> 00:03:22,280
deliberately sent Moli

54
00:03:22,280 --> 00:03:23,880
to another man's bed,

55
00:03:24,640 --> 00:03:26,640
the Shen family would be in chaos.

56
00:03:28,680 --> 00:03:29,480
You owe me one.

57
00:03:30,520 --> 00:03:32,400
I'm waiting for you to return the favor.

58
00:03:46,040 --> 00:03:46,480
Let's go.

59
00:04:05,960 --> 00:04:07,880
Will Master Shen let it go?

60
00:04:07,880 --> 00:04:09,160
All he cares about is profit.

61
00:04:10,520 --> 00:04:11,440
How Wang Hai died

62
00:04:12,200 --> 00:04:13,000
doesn't matter at all.

63
00:04:19,080 --> 00:04:20,040
That Wang Hai

64
00:04:21,200 --> 00:04:22,440
was unscrupulous

65
00:04:23,080 --> 00:04:24,240
and greedy.

66
00:04:27,800 --> 00:04:28,400
Why?

67
00:04:28,640 --> 00:04:30,240
Why did you give Moli to someone else?

68
00:04:30,560 --> 00:04:32,200
(Fu Yunzhen.)

69
00:04:32,800 --> 00:04:34,440
You came here

70
00:04:34,680 --> 00:04:35,760
just to yell at your dad

71
00:04:35,760 --> 00:04:37,640
for a woman?

72
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:38,600
Dad,

73
00:04:38,920 --> 00:04:40,520
you know I like Moli.

74
00:04:40,520 --> 00:04:41,680
Why did you still do this?

75
00:04:41,680 --> 00:04:42,840
For the Shen family,

76
00:04:42,840 --> 00:04:43,680
and for the both of you.

77
00:04:44,440 --> 00:04:45,920
I think you did it for yourself,

78
00:04:45,920 --> 00:04:46,760
for profit,

79
00:04:46,760 --> 00:04:47,640
and for power.

80
00:04:47,640 --> 00:04:48,440
Bastard.

81
00:04:50,720 --> 00:04:51,480
Dad,

82
00:04:51,720 --> 00:04:52,600
why don't you

83
00:04:52,600 --> 00:04:54,160
estimate the price of me and my sister?

84
00:04:54,640 --> 00:04:56,080
Whoever can afford us

85
00:04:56,360 --> 00:04:57,760
can have us.

86
00:04:58,520 --> 00:04:59,360
Shen Xize,

87
00:04:59,800 --> 00:05:00,680
you little jerk!

88
00:05:00,680 --> 00:05:01,440
You...

89
00:05:03,240 --> 00:05:04,000
Master!

90
00:05:04,800 --> 00:05:05,640
Are you alright, master?

91
00:05:07,960 --> 00:05:09,360
The Shen family is vast

92
00:05:09,720 --> 00:05:10,720
and secretive.

93
00:05:11,920 --> 00:05:12,840
Recently,

94
00:05:12,840 --> 00:05:15,720
I heard from one of their distributors.

95
00:05:16,320 --> 00:05:17,720
Master Shen has a ledger,

96
00:05:18,160 --> 00:05:19,240
recording all the profit links

97
00:05:19,240 --> 00:05:21,200
and smuggling warehouses

98
00:05:21,200 --> 00:05:23,480
hidden around Long City.

99
00:05:24,200 --> 00:05:25,920
So if we find this ledger,

100
00:05:26,560 --> 00:05:28,560
we can uproot the entire Shen family

101
00:05:29,320 --> 00:05:31,120
and tear Master Shen to pieces.

102
00:05:32,320 --> 00:05:33,800
I've searched everywhere possible

103
00:05:34,360 --> 00:05:35,480
in the Shen family,

104
00:05:36,440 --> 00:05:37,720
but found nothing.

105
00:05:38,840 --> 00:05:39,880
Leave this to me.

106
00:05:40,200 --> 00:05:41,400
Don't get involved.

107
00:05:42,200 --> 00:05:43,000
Yunzheng,

108
00:05:44,480 --> 00:05:46,240
now that I know everything

109
00:05:46,240 --> 00:05:47,880
and have infiltrated the Shen family,

110
00:05:47,880 --> 00:05:49,680
I can't stand by

111
00:05:49,680 --> 00:05:51,200
and let you face danger alone.

112
00:05:53,240 --> 00:05:54,000
Yunzheng,

113
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:55,560
why don't we join forces
to steal the ledger?

114
00:05:57,360 --> 00:05:58,240
No.

115
00:05:58,720 --> 00:05:59,920
What are you thinking?

116
00:06:06,080 --> 00:06:07,000
Fu Yunzhen,

117
00:06:09,400 --> 00:06:11,280
revenge is something for both of us.

118
00:06:12,400 --> 00:06:13,720
Don't leave me out, alright?

119
00:06:18,880 --> 00:06:19,680
Yunzheng,

120
00:06:20,160 --> 00:06:21,800
what will it take for you to agree?

121
00:06:27,680 --> 00:06:28,480
Unless

122
00:06:34,280 --> 00:06:35,200
you kill me.

123
00:07:12,520 --> 00:07:12,960
Sir Fu,

124
00:07:13,960 --> 00:07:14,960
everything has been arranged.

125
00:07:20,700 --> 00:07:26,700
(Chiyan Gang)

126
00:07:31,360 --> 00:07:31,840
Yunzheng,

127
00:07:32,480 --> 00:07:33,520
I've thought it over.

128
00:07:34,160 --> 00:07:35,520
You're doing it all for my good.

129
00:07:36,280 --> 00:07:37,440
I shouldn't have been unreasonable.

130
00:07:39,320 --> 00:07:40,640
I'm here to apologize to you.

131
00:07:52,920 --> 00:07:53,320
Yunzheng,

132
00:07:54,200 --> 00:07:55,240
why aren't you drinking?

133
00:07:56,440 --> 00:07:57,600
Are you still mad at me?

134
00:08:00,520 --> 00:08:01,640
Eat something first.

135
00:08:26,840 --> 00:08:27,880
Poisoning

136
00:08:27,880 --> 00:08:29,000
and assassination,

137
00:08:29,520 --> 00:08:30,840
I taught you those.

138
00:08:31,440 --> 00:08:33,000
Trying to kill me with these tricks?

139
00:08:36,520 --> 00:08:38,120
You know I can't bring myself
to kill you.

140
00:08:38,960 --> 00:08:39,560
Alright,

141
00:08:40,360 --> 00:08:41,640
I'll give you another choice.

142
00:08:50,840 --> 00:08:51,880
Pick a target.

143
00:08:52,440 --> 00:08:53,280
Didn't you say

144
00:08:53,280 --> 00:08:54,640
you couldn't hurt me?

145
00:08:56,080 --> 00:08:57,120
Then choose someone else.

146
00:09:01,480 --> 00:09:02,360
You're crazy.

147
00:09:03,120 --> 00:09:04,800
These are innocent people.

148
00:09:04,800 --> 00:09:06,440
Did the Shen family

149
00:09:06,800 --> 00:09:07,920
spare our innocent mom?

150
00:09:10,840 --> 00:09:12,080
What do you want to say?

151
00:09:12,080 --> 00:09:13,720
I just want to ensure your safety.

152
00:09:25,880 --> 00:09:27,800
If you can't shoot a stranger,

153
00:09:31,480 --> 00:09:33,400
someone from the Shen family
should be easier.

154
00:09:35,720 --> 00:09:37,240
What's he doing here?

155
00:09:37,240 --> 00:09:39,880
Earlier, I had Wei Zhan write a letter

156
00:09:39,880 --> 00:09:41,120
in your name and handwriting.

157
00:09:41,840 --> 00:09:43,440
It says because of the filth
of the Shen family,

158
00:09:43,440 --> 00:09:44,560
you couldn't bear the humiliation

159
00:09:44,560 --> 00:09:45,960
and decided to leave Long City.

160
00:09:45,960 --> 00:09:47,520
He's now searching the city for you.

161
00:09:48,200 --> 00:09:48,960
Hello,

162
00:09:48,960 --> 00:09:50,000
have you seen her?

163
00:09:51,240 --> 00:09:52,000
No.

164
00:10:02,280 --> 00:10:04,160
Did you do all this

165
00:10:04,160 --> 00:10:05,680
just to make me give up?

166
00:10:06,640 --> 00:10:09,240
Once you decide to seek revenge,

167
00:10:09,240 --> 00:10:11,160
it's only a matter of time
before you shoot him.

168
00:10:14,240 --> 00:10:15,120
Shoot him.

169
00:10:33,840 --> 00:10:34,880
(What's your name?)

170
00:10:38,840 --> 00:10:39,880
(It's all my fault.)

171
00:10:40,800 --> 00:10:41,880
(Come with me.)

172
00:10:54,600 --> 00:10:55,400
Yue,

173
00:10:56,320 --> 00:10:57,320
I'm already in hell.

174
00:10:57,960 --> 00:10:59,960
You don't need to fall with me.

175
00:11:01,160 --> 00:11:02,520
But have you thought about it?

176
00:11:03,280 --> 00:11:04,680
If you fall into danger,

177
00:11:05,040 --> 00:11:06,800
I'll be in danger too.

178
00:11:09,800 --> 00:11:11,200
I won't give up.

179
00:11:19,360 --> 00:11:19,920
Sir Fu,

180
00:11:20,320 --> 00:11:21,440
after Miss Yue returned,

181
00:11:21,440 --> 00:11:23,000
she locked herself in her room.

182
00:11:23,760 --> 00:11:24,640
Keep an eye on her.

183
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:38,920
Who is it?

184
00:11:55,760 --> 00:11:56,560
It's me.

185
00:12:01,120 --> 00:12:02,280
Who said you could drink?

186
00:12:02,800 --> 00:12:03,520
Where's Wei Zhan?

187
00:12:03,520 --> 00:12:05,000
Didn't I tell him to watch you?

188
00:12:06,800 --> 00:12:08,480
Stop blaming others.

189
00:12:09,800 --> 00:12:10,760
It's you.

190
00:12:10,760 --> 00:12:12,160
You bullied me.

191
00:12:13,120 --> 00:12:14,280
I'll take you back to your room.

192
00:12:14,280 --> 00:12:15,240
I don't want to go back.

193
00:12:16,960 --> 00:12:19,080
You have to give me an explanation.

194
00:12:19,080 --> 00:12:20,160
What explanation do you want?

195
00:12:23,880 --> 00:12:24,640
Yuzheng,

196
00:12:25,240 --> 00:12:25,920
why do you

197
00:12:26,600 --> 00:12:29,360
keep pushing me away?

198
00:12:33,680 --> 00:12:36,040
Is it because I'm useless?

199
00:12:36,960 --> 00:12:39,040
You asked me to kill you,

200
00:12:39,040 --> 00:12:40,720
but I couldn't do it.

201
00:12:41,320 --> 00:12:42,760
You asked me to kill others,

202
00:12:43,480 --> 00:12:44,840
but I couldn't do it either.

203
00:12:46,320 --> 00:12:48,640
Do you hate me?

204
00:12:49,280 --> 00:12:50,880
You're drunk. Don't talk nonsense.

205
00:12:50,880 --> 00:12:52,480
I'm not drunk.

206
00:12:53,120 --> 00:12:54,160
You...

207
00:12:54,160 --> 00:12:56,440
You won't abandon me, will you?

208
00:13:01,920 --> 00:13:03,840
Even if I have to give up

209
00:13:03,840 --> 00:13:05,000
everything,

210
00:13:05,440 --> 00:13:06,560
I'll never abandon you.

211
00:13:18,960 --> 00:13:19,960
I knew it.

212
00:13:20,680 --> 00:13:22,400
You think about me in your heart.

213
00:13:29,080 --> 00:13:29,840
Yunzheng, come here.

214
00:13:32,800 --> 00:13:33,760
I have a question.

215
00:13:36,240 --> 00:13:36,880
Yunzheng,

216
00:13:39,080 --> 00:13:40,280
do I smell good?

217
00:13:44,600 --> 00:13:45,160
What's wrong?

218
00:13:45,160 --> 00:13:46,320
My leg.

219
00:14:03,040 --> 00:14:03,920
It hurts.
