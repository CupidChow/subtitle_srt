(In Memory of Beloved Mother, Fu Yaru)

36
00:04:03,880 --> 00:04:04,640
Mom,

37
00:04:06,040 --> 00:04:08,000
I shouldn't have made
such a big mistake.

38
00:04:08,680 --> 00:04:10,560
I shouldn't have had
such twisted thoughts.

39
00:04:12,120 --> 00:04:13,920
I broke my promise from back then.

40
00:04:14,680 --> 00:04:15,680
I'm ashamed

41
00:04:16,560 --> 00:04:18,160
of the grace of your upbringing.

42
00:04:20,440 --> 00:04:22,880
I'm simply unworthy of being a brother,

43
00:04:24,920 --> 00:04:26,760
and even more unworthy of facing Yue.

44
00:04:47,720 --> 00:04:48,520
Sir Shen,

45
00:04:49,080 --> 00:04:50,720
how about these?

46
00:04:50,720 --> 00:04:52,360
How dare you display
such inferior goods?

47
00:04:52,800 --> 00:04:54,120
Bring out the most expensive ones

48
00:04:54,120 --> 00:04:55,480
for me to see.

49
00:04:55,720 --> 00:04:56,280
Alright,

50
00:04:56,640 --> 00:04:58,920
please have a seat on the sofa.

51
00:05:09,320 --> 00:05:10,240
Sir Shen, give me a moment.

52
00:05:10,240 --> 00:05:11,360
I'll get it for you.

53
00:05:13,360 --> 00:05:14,800
There's no need for this.

54
00:05:14,800 --> 00:05:16,560
The simplest plain ring will do.

55
00:05:16,560 --> 00:05:17,320
That won't do.

56
00:05:17,760 --> 00:05:18,920
Only the brightest ring

57
00:05:18,920 --> 00:05:20,680
is worthy of our
most extravagant wedding.

58
00:05:26,160 --> 00:05:27,160
Sir Shen,

59
00:05:27,160 --> 00:05:28,160
look at this one,

60
00:05:28,160 --> 00:05:29,280
The Rose.

61
00:05:29,280 --> 00:05:30,720
It's a full ten-carat ring

62
00:05:30,720 --> 00:05:31,960
and it's imported.

63
00:05:34,400 --> 00:05:35,240
Barely acceptable.

64
00:05:36,360 --> 00:05:37,120
Moli,

65
00:05:37,560 --> 00:05:38,160
come,

66
00:05:38,600 --> 00:05:39,360
try it on.

67
00:05:43,120 --> 00:05:43,760
Do you like it?

68
00:05:44,440 --> 00:05:45,000
Hmm.

69
00:05:52,720 --> 00:05:54,120
This one is really nice.

70
00:05:55,760 --> 00:05:56,800
Sir, I'll take it.

71
00:05:56,800 --> 00:05:57,600
But,

72
00:05:57,600 --> 00:05:58,200
Zhiwei,

73
00:05:58,200 --> 00:05:59,440
I picked it first.

74
00:06:02,200 --> 00:06:03,040
Sir,

75
00:06:03,400 --> 00:06:04,520
keep the change.

76
00:06:05,120 --> 00:06:06,120
First come, first serve.

77
00:06:06,440 --> 00:06:07,360
Besides,

78
00:06:07,360 --> 00:06:08,360
The Rose,

79
00:06:08,360 --> 00:06:09,880
this ring has my name on it.

80
00:06:10,360 --> 00:06:11,200
Anyone else wearing it

81
00:06:11,600 --> 00:06:12,440
just wouldn't be fitting,

82
00:06:12,720 --> 00:06:13,120
right?

83
00:06:15,240 --> 00:06:16,000
Sir,

84
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:17,240
fill in any amount you like.

85
00:06:21,200 --> 00:06:21,840
Sir Shen,

86
00:06:22,040 --> 00:06:23,040
it's very kind of you.

87
00:06:24,120 --> 00:06:24,800
Zhiwei,

88
00:06:25,560 --> 00:06:27,360
you're still far from getting married.

89
00:06:29,560 --> 00:06:31,160
I forgot to inform you.

90
00:06:31,840 --> 00:06:32,720
I'm also

91
00:06:32,720 --> 00:06:33,880
engaged.

92
00:06:38,280 --> 00:06:39,400
As for the wedding date,

93
00:06:39,400 --> 00:06:40,560
it's the same day as yours.

94
00:06:40,960 --> 00:06:42,840
Just perfect to outshine you.

95
00:06:58,240 --> 00:06:59,680
Yunzheng, I...

96
00:06:59,680 --> 00:07:00,880
Let's get engaged.

97
00:07:05,040 --> 00:07:06,280
You've gone to great lengths

98
00:07:06,280 --> 00:07:07,880
just to marry me, right?

99
00:07:09,920 --> 00:07:11,640
Yunzheng, you've finally come around.

100
00:07:11,640 --> 00:07:13,040
I'll go tell dad right away.

101
00:07:19,360 --> 00:07:20,760
As soon as I told him,

102
00:07:20,760 --> 00:07:22,200
he agreed immediately.

103
00:07:22,920 --> 00:07:24,000
So from now on,

104
00:07:24,280 --> 00:07:25,160
Yunzheng

105
00:07:25,160 --> 00:07:27,000
will be your brother-in-law.

106
00:07:30,480 --> 00:07:31,240
Moli,

107
00:07:31,760 --> 00:07:32,760
address him that, will you?

108
00:07:34,600 --> 00:07:36,160
Are you that impatient?

109
00:07:36,400 --> 00:07:37,560
Of course.

110
00:07:37,560 --> 00:07:39,160
This was your idea.

111
00:07:51,880 --> 00:07:52,640
Alright then,

112
00:07:54,120 --> 00:07:54,920
brother-in-law.

113
00:07:56,960 --> 00:07:58,920
Moli is very gentle and graceful.

114
00:08:00,480 --> 00:08:01,720
Show some appreciation, will you?

115
00:08:11,680 --> 00:08:12,480
Sister-in-law.

116
00:08:18,080 --> 00:08:19,960
I hope you become a sweet couple.

117
00:08:20,560 --> 00:08:22,120
I won't steal your favorite.

118
00:08:29,160 --> 00:08:30,160
Yunzheng

119
00:08:30,160 --> 00:08:31,880
will make me happier than you.

120
00:08:33,320 --> 00:08:34,360
Let's go, Yunzheng.

121
00:08:34,360 --> 00:08:35,560
Let's try on the wedding dress.

122
00:08:38,200 --> 00:08:39,400
Please.

123
00:08:42,600 --> 00:08:43,920
Moli,

124
00:08:43,920 --> 00:08:45,880
give me a chance to make it up to you.

125
00:08:46,560 --> 00:08:47,520
Xize,

126
00:08:47,520 --> 00:08:49,520
I'm too tired. I want to go home
and rest.

127
00:08:49,520 --> 00:08:50,680
That won't do.

128
00:08:50,680 --> 00:08:52,120
Our wedding day is approaching

129
00:08:52,120 --> 00:08:53,760
and it's on the same day as theirs.

130
00:08:54,120 --> 00:08:55,440
We can't lose.

131

Come on, let's try on
the wedding dress too.

dressed so formally.

00:10:08,520 --> 00:10:10,200
