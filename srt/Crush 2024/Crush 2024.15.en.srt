Bear with it.

16
00:01:40,040 --> 00:01:40,760
Yunzheng,

17
00:01:41,120 --> 00:01:42,320
do you remember

18
00:01:42,320 --> 00:01:43,520
when I was little,

19
00:01:44,080 --> 00:01:45,720
I was actually very popular with boys?

20
00:01:47,120 --> 00:01:48,720
But why did all those boys

21
00:01:49,240 --> 00:01:50,480
who pursued me disappear

22
00:01:50,840 --> 00:01:52,160
after I grew up?

23
00:01:53,240 --> 00:01:54,600
Did you

24
00:01:54,600 --> 00:01:56,240
chase them all away?

25
00:01:58,560 --> 00:01:59,040
I...

26
00:02:06,680 --> 00:02:07,720
You did it on purpose.

27
00:02:07,720 --> 00:02:08,800
Thank me.

28
00:02:08,800 --> 00:02:10,120
The bullet is out

29
00:02:10,120 --> 00:02:11,320
before you even feel the pain.

30
00:02:15,440 --> 00:02:17,080
This is just the simplest treatment.

31
00:02:17,080 --> 00:02:18,440
We still need to get back quickly.

32
00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:21,840
I'm fine.

33
00:02:23,640 --> 00:02:24,800
Aren't your fiancée worried

34
00:02:25,320 --> 00:02:27,040
since you haven't been back?

35
00:02:30,440 --> 00:02:31,600
Dealing with her

36
00:02:31,600 --> 00:02:33,200
is just a temporary measure.

37
00:02:33,200 --> 00:02:34,440
I've never touched her.

38
00:02:40,400 --> 00:02:41,920
I know who was beside me

39
00:02:42,920 --> 00:02:44,200
that night.

40
00:02:57,080 --> 00:02:58,320
Then what about the things you said?

41
00:02:59,720 --> 00:03:01,040
Am I dreaming?

42
00:03:01,040 --> 00:03:02,680
You shouldn't be here.

43
00:03:03,200 --> 00:03:05,280
You shouldn't appear in my dream.

44
00:03:07,560 --> 00:03:09,000
Of course, I said it to you.

45
00:03:09,240 --> 00:03:11,200
Do you remember what you said?

46
00:03:12,040 --> 00:03:13,680
I don't want to wake up,

47
00:03:13,680 --> 00:03:15,960
so you'll belong to me forever.

48
00:03:18,760 --> 00:03:19,720
I don't really remember.

49
00:03:19,720 --> 00:03:20,760
Liar.

50
00:03:20,760 --> 00:03:21,880
You clearly remember.

51
00:03:22,920 --> 00:03:23,680
Tell me,

52
00:03:23,680 --> 00:03:25,080
do you

53
00:03:25,080 --> 00:03:26,320
also

54
00:03:26,320 --> 00:03:27,600
like me?

55
00:03:28,200 --> 00:03:30,160
The kind of love between a man
and a woman?

56
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:36,800
When will you

57
00:03:37,800 --> 00:03:39,200
finally understand?

58
00:03:40,160 --> 00:03:41,080
Understand what?

59
00:03:41,080 --> 00:03:42,280
Tell me now.

60
00:03:43,320 --> 00:03:44,560
Is it love that grows over time

61
00:03:45,080 --> 00:03:46,560
or love at first sight?

00:06:29,120 --> 00:06:30,480
You're allowed to draw on my face,

88
00:06:30,960 --> 00:06:32,120
but I'm not allowed to bite you?

89
00:06:35,440 --> 00:06:36,920
I'm drawing you.

90
00:06:37,480 --> 00:06:38,400
I'll teach you.

91
00:06:39,720 --> 00:06:41,360
Do I need you to teach me?

92
00:06:41,360 --> 00:06:43,200
I can draw you with my eyes closed.

Moli,

94
00:07:17,880 --> 00:07:19,040
I finally found you.

95
00:07:20,360 --> 00:07:21,120
Yunzheng,

96
00:07:21,720 --> 00:07:22,640
you're here too.

97
00:07:23,440 --> 00:07:24,480
He saved me.

98
00:07:24,760 --> 00:07:25,800
He's seriously injured.

99
00:07:26,080 --> 00:07:27,080
He saved you?

100
00:07:27,920 --> 00:07:28,680
What a coincidence.

101
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:33,160
Her foot is injured.

102
00:07:33,800 --> 00:07:34,880
Don't trouble yourself.

103
00:07:35,280 --> 00:07:36,480
She's my fiancée.

104
00:07:36,800 --> 00:07:37,880
I'll take care of her.

105
00:08:02,040 --> 00:08:03,000
Is your leg hurt?

106
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:03,800
Xize, I'm fine.

107
00:08:05,680 --> 00:08:06,760
You can't ignore an injury.

108
00:08:07,360 --> 00:08:08,280
I'm really fine.

109
00:08:11,040 --> 00:08:11,840
Moli,

110
00:08:12,760 --> 00:08:14,320
you seem to be connected with Yunzheng.

111
00:08:16,040 --> 00:08:17,240
He's saved you several times.

112
00:08:18,400 --> 00:08:19,240
It's just a coincidence.

113
00:08:19,880 --> 00:08:20,520
If

114
00:08:21,680 --> 00:08:22,800
I had saved you every time,

115
00:08:23,280 --> 00:08:24,080
would there be

116
00:08:24,080 --> 00:08:25,240
something different between us?

117
00:08:27,080 --> 00:08:28,240
Why do you ask?

118
00:08:30,400 --> 00:08:31,560
I'm just concerned about you.

119
00:08:31,920 --> 00:08:32,760
Yunzheng saved you,

120
00:08:33,160 --> 00:08:34,560
so he's our savior.

121
00:08:34,960 --> 00:08:35,440
We must

122
00:08:35,800 --> 00:08:37,000
thank him properly.

123
00:08:50,080 --> 00:08:50,840
Miss Zhiwei,

124
00:08:50,840 --> 00:08:52,280
I saw Fu Yunyue.

125
00:08:52,640 --> 00:08:53,560
Are you sure?

126
00:08:53,920 --> 00:08:55,160
Fu Yunyue is still alive?

127
00:08:55,160 --> 00:08:56,520
I saw her with my own eyes.

128
00:08:58,400 --> 00:09:00,680
That wicked woman is really lucky.

129
00:09:08,760 --> 00:09:09,600
Yunzheng,

130
00:09:09,600 --> 00:09:10,760
why are you here?

131
00:09:10,760 --> 00:09:11,840
I want you to meet someone.

132
00:09:16,680 --> 00:09:17,840
Miss Shen, help me!

133
00:09:17,840 --> 00:09:18,640
Miss Shen,

134
00:09:18,640 --> 00:09:19,880
only you can save me.

135
00:09:20,160 --> 00:09:20,840
Who are you?

136
00:09:20,840 --> 00:09:22,040
I don't know you.

137
00:09:22,040 --> 00:09:24,080
You paid me to abduct Moli

138
00:09:24,080 --> 00:09:25,720
- and asked me to sell her.
- Shut up!

139
00:09:25,720 --> 00:09:26,840
I don't know you at all.

140
00:09:26,840 --> 00:09:27,440
Don't...

141
00:09:35,600 --> 00:09:36,720
Yunzheng, I...

142
00:09:36,720 --> 00:09:38,240
I just want you to know

143
00:09:38,240 --> 00:09:39,560
if there's a next time,

144
00:09:39,960 --> 00:09:41,360
you'll die worse than him.

145
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:19,160
Master, bad news.

146
00:10:19,160 --> 00:10:20,240
Miss Zhiwei disappeared

147
00:10:20,240 --> 00:10:21,120
on her way back.

148
00:10:21,800 --> 00:10:22,320
What?

149
00:10:37,560 --> 00:10:38,440
Zhiwei!

150
00:10:38,440 --> 00:10:40,080
- Zhiwei!
- Miss Zhiwei!

151
00:10:40,080 --> 00:10:41,160
Search inside.

152
00:10:41,160 --> 00:10:41,920
Over there.

153
00:10:42,320 --> 00:10:43,520
- Check over there.
- Shen Zhiwei!

154
00:10:44,400 --> 00:10:45,320
Zhiwei!

155
00:10:45,520 --> 00:10:46,520
Shen Zhiwei!

156
00:10:52,720 --> 00:10:53,480
Look,

157
00:10:53,800 --> 00:10:54,920
what's this?

158
00:11:02,200 --> 00:11:03,400
This is my sister's hairpin.

159
00:11:05,760 --> 00:11:06,880
It's Zhiwei's hairpin.

160
00:11:11,440 --> 00:11:12,080
This way.

161
00:11:12,080 --> 00:11:12,840
Follow me.

162
00:11:15,320 --> 00:11:16,920
Stop, stop!

163
00:11:18,960 --> 00:11:19,440
Zhiwei!

164
00:11:19,840 --> 00:11:20,720
Zhiwei,

165
00:11:20,720 --> 00:11:22,480
- Don't worry. Dad's here.
- Hurry!

166
00:11:22,480 --> 00:11:23,680
Don't be afraid, sweetie.

167
00:11:23,680 --> 00:11:25,040
Dad's here.

168
00:11:25,040 --> 00:11:25,760
Don't be afraid.

169
00:11:25,760 --> 00:11:28,320
Hurry up!

170
00:11:29,440 --> 00:11:30,720
Careful, don't be afraid.

171
00:11:30,720 --> 00:11:32,000
Tell me what happened.

172
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:33,160
Do you know who did this?

173
00:11:35,080 --> 00:11:36,280
Dad,

174
00:11:36,280 --> 00:11:37,520
it's her.

175
00:11:37,520 --> 00:11:39,120
She wants to kill me.

176
00:11:41,560 --> 00:11:42,520
Miss Shen,

177
00:11:42,840 --> 00:11:44,240
you must be mistaken.

178
00:11:44,240 --> 00:11:45,960
Stop pretending to be innocent.

179
00:11:45,960 --> 00:11:48,160
You've been plotting
to get revenge on me.

180
00:11:48,960 --> 00:11:50,160
Miss Shen,

181
00:11:50,160 --> 00:11:52,280
I'm really confused here.

182
00:11:52,280 --> 00:11:53,760
What grudge do we have?

183
00:11:53,760 --> 00:11:54,680
Why do I get revenge?

184
00:11:56,440 --> 00:11:57,600
- Dad.
- Zhiwei.

185
00:11:57,600 --> 00:11:58,800
Stop making a scene.

186
00:12:00,040 --> 00:12:01,160
It was Moli

187
00:12:01,160 --> 00:12:02,600
who found your hairpin.

188
00:12:02,840 --> 00:12:04,000
Otherwise, we wouldn't have

189
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:05,000
made it in time.

190
00:12:05,840 --> 00:12:07,840
Alright, alright.

191
00:12:09,200 --> 00:12:10,440
There must be

192
00:12:10,920 --> 00:12:12,200
some misunderstanding.

193
00:12:13,440 --> 00:12:14,800
Zhiwei,

194
00:12:15,160 --> 00:12:16,480
come home with me first.

195
00:12:16,760 --> 00:12:17,840
But rest assured,

196
00:12:17,840 --> 00:12:18,480
I

197
00:12:19,120 --> 00:12:21,040
will find the culprit for you.

198
00:12:22,160 --> 00:12:22,760
Let's go.

199
00:12:28,480 --> 00:12:29,160
Ignore her.

200
00:12:47,080 --> 00:12:48,880
Weren't you too reckless today?

201
00:12:49,520 --> 00:12:51,240
She's bullied me so many times.

202
00:12:51,240 --> 00:12:52,520
I give her a lesson

203
00:12:52,960 --> 00:12:53,800
so she knows

204
00:12:54,560 --> 00:12:55,640
I'm not to be messed with.

205
00:12:56,320 --> 00:12:58,080
What? Are you feeling sorry for her?

206
00:13:00,800 --> 00:13:01,960
Last time, you didn't

207
00:13:02,320 --> 00:13:03,560
finish the drawing in the cave.

208
00:13:04,440 --> 00:13:05,440
That's body painting.

209
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:07,320
I need a model.

210
00:13:08,600 --> 00:13:10,120
We can continue now.

211
00:13:23,280 --> 00:13:24,040
Moli,

212
00:13:24,240 --> 00:13:25,440
