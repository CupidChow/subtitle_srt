14
00:01:22,360 --> 00:01:22,920
Moli,

15
00:01:23,400 --> 00:01:24,480
are you asleep?

16
00:01:33,080 --> 00:01:33,560
What's wrong?

17
00:01:34,480 --> 00:01:35,840
Here are the pictures
of the hotel's food

18
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:37,120
and the decoration templates.

19
00:01:37,440 --> 00:01:38,080
Pick one.

20
00:01:39,200 --> 00:01:40,360
I like them all.

21
00:01:40,360 --> 00:01:41,400
You can choose.

22
00:01:42,360 --> 00:01:43,440
Our wedding

23
00:01:43,440 --> 00:01:44,680
must be the best.

24
00:01:44,680 --> 00:01:45,840
Everything

25
00:01:45,840 --> 00:01:46,800
should be what you like.

26
00:01:47,440 --> 00:01:48,200
I...

27
00:01:52,520 --> 00:01:53,320
Are you painting?

28
00:01:56,360 --> 00:01:57,400
I'm just doodling.

29
00:01:57,960 --> 00:01:58,760
Perfect,

30
00:01:59,600 --> 00:02:00,560
let's paint you

31
00:02:00,560 --> 00:02:01,480
and me

32
00:02:01,480 --> 00:02:02,800
as our wedding picture.

33
00:02:03,560 --> 00:02:04,600
I can do it alone.

34
00:02:05,040 --> 00:02:06,240
Don't press too hard.

35
00:02:06,240 --> 00:02:07,160
Let's paint together.

36
00:02:10,200 --> 00:02:11,000
Moli,

37
00:02:11,640 --> 00:02:12,720
after we get married,

38
00:02:13,120 --> 00:02:14,640
I'll take you away from Long City.

39
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:16,440
We'll go to a place
full of jasmine.

40
00:02:17,520 --> 00:02:18,800
It'll be ours alone

41
00:02:19,400 --> 00:02:20,120
where we'll grow old.

42
00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:21,560
By that time,

43
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:23,000
no one will disturb us.

44
00:02:43,760 --> 00:02:44,600
Xize,

45
00:02:45,440 --> 00:02:46,800
I just remembered

46
00:02:46,800 --> 00:02:47,720
I need to

47
00:02:47,720 --> 00:02:48,960
pick the desserts early tomorrow.

48
00:02:49,720 --> 00:02:51,160
I want to wash up and rest early.

49
00:02:51,600 --> 00:02:52,600
You should go back now.

50
00:02:52,600 --> 00:02:53,480
Alright,

51
00:02:53,760 --> 00:02:54,880
I'll pick you up in the morning.

52
00:03:01,920 --> 00:03:02,440
Get some rest.

53
00:03:12,400 --> 00:03:13,160
What is it?

54
00:03:13,160 --> 00:03:14,040
Are you reluctant?

55
00:03:17,240 --> 00:03:18,200
How could I be?

56
00:03:18,840 --> 00:03:20,480
I just feel it's too cruel to use him.

57
00:03:22,520 --> 00:03:23,720
He is Shen Wende's son,

58
00:03:24,360 --> 00:03:26,040
the most famous playboy in Long City.

59
00:03:26,320 --> 00:03:27,680
Do you think

60
00:03:28,400 --> 00:03:29,920
he's an innocent boy?

61
00:03:31,560 --> 00:03:32,720
Everything he enjoys

62
00:03:33,080 --> 00:03:34,320
is built on Shen Wende's

63
00:03:34,840 --> 00:03:35,680
crimes

64
00:03:35,680 --> 00:03:36,600
of smuggling

65
00:03:36,600 --> 00:03:38,040
and harming countless innocent people.

66
00:03:39,200 --> 00:03:40,160
If it weren't for him,

67
00:03:40,160 --> 00:03:41,200
how would our mom have died?

68
00:03:41,200 --> 00:03:42,280
How would we bear

69
00:03:42,280 --> 00:03:43,320
so much hatred?

70
00:03:44,320 --> 00:03:45,400
If we talk about innocence,

71
00:03:46,120 --> 00:03:47,080
we're more innocent than him.

72
00:04:26,040 --> 00:04:26,760
My hands are dirty.

73
00:04:28,160 --> 00:04:29,040
Body painting

74
00:04:30,120 --> 00:04:31,480
is supposed to be done on the body.

75
00:05:03,360 --> 00:05:04,280
Fu Yunzheng, Fu Yunyue,

76
00:05:05,240 --> 00:05:06,120
I finally found out

77
00:05:06,120 --> 00:05:07,320
your true identities

78
00:05:07,320 --> 00:05:08,120
and your purpose.

79
00:05:12,280 --> 00:05:13,720
Do you think

80
00:05:15,440 --> 00:05:17,040
you can destroy my business

81
00:05:17,040 --> 00:05:18,800
and uproot the Shen family?

82
00:05:19,960 --> 00:05:21,680
What a joke.

83
00:06:32,640 --> 00:06:34,240
While I was away,

84
00:06:34,520 --> 00:06:35,960
you managed

85
00:06:35,960 --> 00:06:36,920
the family business well.

86
00:06:37,840 --> 00:06:39,360
It was my duty.

87
00:06:46,400 --> 00:06:47,880
This one looks good.

88
00:06:48,360 --> 00:06:49,200
What about this one?

89
00:06:49,200 --> 00:06:49,880
No.

90
00:06:51,360 --> 00:06:52,200
You don't like this.

91
00:06:54,600 --> 00:06:55,440
How about this?

92
00:06:56,200 --> 00:06:57,040
Here, taste it.

93
00:06:57,760 --> 00:06:59,120
Please, this way.

94
00:07:03,120 --> 00:07:04,560
Hey, Yunzheng.

95
00:07:05,280 --> 00:07:06,560
You came with my sister as well.

96
00:07:06,880 --> 00:07:08,120
The staff said

97
00:07:08,640 --> 00:07:10,880
couples who come together

98
00:07:10,880 --> 00:07:13,160
to choose the food are sweet.

99
00:07:19,200 --> 00:07:20,880
Moli, how about this one?

100
00:07:29,920 --> 00:07:31,080
Does it taste good?

101
00:07:40,600 --> 00:07:41,720
It's indeed good.

102
00:07:42,400 --> 00:07:43,320
Xize,

103
00:07:43,320 --> 00:07:45,200
who are you showing it to?

104
00:07:47,400 --> 00:07:48,920
This thing

105
00:07:48,920 --> 00:07:50,640
doesn't belong at a wedding banquet.

106
00:07:52,440 --> 00:07:53,520
Sorry, Mr. Fu.

107
00:07:53,520 --> 00:07:54,720
I'll replace it immediately.

108
00:07:57,480 --> 00:07:58,240
Xize,

109
00:07:58,800 --> 00:08:00,520
let's go for the previous dessert.

110
00:08:00,520 --> 00:08:01,960
Aren't we also choosing the venue?

111
00:08:02,200 --> 00:08:03,320
Let's go.

112
00:08:08,120 --> 00:08:09,840
We haven't decided
on the wedding dance yet.

113
00:08:16,560 --> 00:08:17,680
Yunzheng,

114
00:08:18,120 --> 00:08:19,160
look at them.

115
00:08:19,160 --> 00:08:20,440
A talented boy and a pretty girl

116
00:08:20,440 --> 00:08:21,560
openly and rightfully together.

117
00:08:21,560 --> 00:08:22,440
What a beautiful couple.

118
00:08:24,920 --> 00:08:26,160
(I have to watch you get married)

119
00:08:26,160 --> 00:08:27,560
(with my own eyes.)

120
00:08:28,240 --> 00:08:29,800
(I can't do it.)

121
00:08:30,680 --> 00:08:32,400
Put the flowers here for now.

122
00:08:38,480 --> 00:08:39,280
Yunzheng,

123
00:08:40,600 --> 00:08:41,560
these pieces of furniture

124
00:08:41,560 --> 00:08:43,520
were airlifted from abroad.

125
00:08:43,520 --> 00:08:44,680
You can't find them anywhere else.

126
00:08:45,520 --> 00:08:46,960
I've arranged everything.

127
00:08:46,960 --> 00:08:48,360
After we get married,

128
00:08:48,360 --> 00:08:49,680
we'll go abroad for our honeymoon.

129
00:08:50,120 --> 00:08:50,960
No need.

130
00:08:51,760 --> 00:08:53,320
How come?

131
00:08:53,320 --> 00:08:55,040
My wedding

132
00:08:55,040 --> 00:08:56,840
must be grand.

133
00:08:57,480 --> 00:08:59,200
I've decided to cancel the wedding.

134
00:09:07,720 --> 00:09:08,640
What's the matter?

135
00:09:08,640 --> 00:09:10,880
You can't stand your sister

136
00:09:12,120 --> 00:09:13,160
marrying another man?

137
00:09:14,920 --> 00:09:16,440
Even if she gets married,

138
00:09:17,120 --> 00:09:18,760
it can only be to me.

139
00:09:19,680 --> 00:09:21,480
Fu Yunzheng, think carefully.

140
00:09:22,880 --> 00:09:24,600
If you break off the engagement,

141
00:09:24,600 --> 00:09:26,320
I'll make one phone call

142
00:09:26,680 --> 00:09:28,720
and those indecent photos

143
00:09:28,720 --> 00:09:31,000
will be everywhere in Long City.

144
00:09:33,360 --> 00:09:34,040
Your beloved sister

145
00:09:34,040 --> 00:09:36,400
will be seen as an unvirtuous woman.

146
00:09:36,400 --> 00:09:37,960
I'll have my dad send her to the gallows

147
00:09:37,960 --> 00:09:39,680
and burn her alive.

148
00:09:57,800 --> 00:09:58,600
Come with me.

149
00:09:59,880 --> 00:10:00,680
Don't be impulsive.

150
00:10:12,760 --> 00:10:14,720
Yunzheng, we've worked
so hard for so long.

151
00:10:15,040 --> 00:10:15,920
We're just one step away

152
00:10:15,920 --> 00:10:16,920
from getting the ledger.

153
00:10:17,880 --> 00:10:19,360
Leaving now isn't worth it.

154
00:10:20,160 --> 00:10:22,200
I won't let you marry another man.

155
00:10:23,120 --> 00:10:24,400
It was all just an act.

156
00:10:24,400 --> 00:10:25,320
It's fake.

157
00:10:25,640 --> 00:10:26,920
And didn't you say

158
00:10:27,520 --> 00:10:28,320
we've borne the hatred

159
00:10:28,320 --> 00:10:29,880
for so many years

160
00:10:30,320 --> 00:10:31,240
because of Shen Wende's

161
00:10:31,240 --> 00:10:32,160
evil deeds?

162
00:10:32,880 --> 00:10:33,800
Now we have the chance

163
00:10:33,800 --> 00:10:34,680
to avenge mom

164
00:10:34,680 --> 00:10:35,600
and make him pay.

165
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:37,360
Why should we give up?

166
00:10:40,920 --> 00:10:42,200
I only want you by my side.

167
00:10:54,640 --> 00:10:56,720
You set the wedding date
for the same day.

168
00:10:56,720 --> 00:10:57,720
I'm happy about it.

169
00:10:58,720 --> 00:11:00,400
I got you here today

170
00:11:00,400 --> 00:11:02,080
mainly to discuss

171
00:11:02,080 --> 00:11:03,120
the wedding process.

172
00:11:03,360 --> 00:11:03,800
Uncle,

173
00:11:04,600 --> 00:11:05,560
I also have something

174
00:11:05,560 --> 00:11:06,800
to discuss with you today.

175
00:11:07,720 --> 00:11:08,200
Alright,

176
00:11:08,200 --> 00:11:08,960
go ahead.

177
00:11:08,960 --> 00:11:09,480
Dad,

178
00:11:10,200 --> 00:11:10,720
let me tell you

179
00:11:10,720 --> 00:11:12,120
something first.

180
00:11:19,720 --> 00:11:20,800
Some people

181
00:11:21,120 --> 00:11:22,640
choose to be animals

182
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:24,440
instead of being decent humans.

183
00:11:24,760 --> 00:11:26,520
They must be taught a lesson.

184
00:11:32,440 --> 00:11:33,520
Dad, how are the photos?

185
00:11:33,520 --> 00:11:34,720
Are they any good?

186
00:11:35,840 --> 00:11:36,600
Wonderful.

187
00:11:41,480 --> 00:11:42,440
The photos are well taken.

188
00:11:44,360 --> 00:11:46,040
But since the photos are so good,

189
00:11:46,040 --> 00:11:47,080
why not keep them to yourselves?

190
00:11:47,080 --> 00:11:48,520
No need to show them to me.

191
00:11:51,040 --> 00:11:51,840
Fu Yunzheng,

192
00:11:52,080 --> 00:11:52,640
you...

193
00:11:53,160 --> 00:11:53,920
Zhiwei,

194
00:11:55,080 --> 00:11:57,360
we had some misunderstandings before.

195
00:11:57,960 --> 00:11:58,720
I apologize.

196
00:11:59,320 --> 00:12:00,160
I promise

197
00:12:00,960 --> 00:12:02,080
to give you

198
00:12:02,080 --> 00:12:03,080
a grand wedding.

199
00:12:04,680 --> 00:12:05,280
Uncle,

200
00:12:06,440 --> 00:12:08,400
I'd like to move
the wedding date forward,

201
00:12:08,400 --> 00:12:09,520
if you permit.

202
00:12:15,640 --> 00:12:16,880
Today is mom's anniversary.

203
00:12:17,120 --> 00:12:18,680
Tell mom

204
00:12:18,920 --> 00:12:20,520
what you just told me.

205
00:12:31,400 --> 00:12:32,120
Mom,

206
00:12:32,800 --> 00:12:34,640
it's not that my brother and I
don't want to leave.

207
00:12:35,280 --> 00:12:37,720
We've suffered so much on this journey.

208
00:12:38,280 --> 00:12:39,280
If we don't kill him,

209
00:12:39,280 --> 00:12:40,960
he'll kill us.

210
00:12:40,960 --> 00:12:42,680
We have no way out.

211
00:12:50,160 --> 00:12:50,920
I permit.

212
00:12:51,680 --> 00:12:52,520
Ah,

213
00:12:53,800 --> 00:12:55,840
I'm old.

214
00:12:55,840 --> 00:12:57,080
I just wish

215
00:12:57,080 --> 00:12:59,080
for you all to be safe

216
00:12:59,080 --> 00:13:00,800
and successful.

217
00:13:01,720 --> 00:13:02,520
Uncle Shen,

218
00:13:03,160 --> 00:13:04,520
how about we make it a double wedding?

219
00:13:09,080 --> 00:13:09,720
Good.

220
00:13:10,400 --> 00:13:12,000
Since you're all in such a hurry,

221
00:13:12,280 --> 00:13:13,520
in three days,

222
00:13:14,160 --> 00:13:15,600
you shall be married.
