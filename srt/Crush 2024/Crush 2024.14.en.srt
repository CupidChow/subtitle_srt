00:01:20,200 --> 00:01:21,640
You wicked woman, trying to seduce...

15
00:01:24,960 --> 00:01:26,320
Moli, what are you doing?

16
00:01:27,840 --> 00:01:29,840
I thought this scarf would suit you,

17
00:01:29,840 --> 00:01:31,200
so I wanted to take it
for you to try,

18
00:01:31,520 --> 00:01:32,920
but the mannequin suddenly fell.

19
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:34,720
Let me help.

20
00:01:40,280 --> 00:01:41,320
Zhiwei,

21
00:01:41,320 --> 00:01:43,240
what are you suspicious about
all day long?

22
00:01:43,240 --> 00:01:44,800
I also need to try on
wedding dresses here.

23
00:01:44,800 --> 00:01:45,720
Go away.

24
00:01:46,840 --> 00:01:47,720
Go.

25
00:01:55,440 --> 00:01:56,440
You can fool Xize,

26
00:01:56,440 --> 00:01:57,560
but you can't fool me.

27
00:01:57,880 --> 00:01:59,280
The person in the room just now

28
00:01:59,280 --> 00:02:00,480
was Yunzheng.

29
00:02:01,720 --> 00:02:03,200
I don't know what you're saying.

30
00:02:04,040 --> 00:02:06,400
If you keep seducing Yunzheng,

31
00:02:06,400 --> 00:02:08,040
I'll make sure you can't
marry into my family.

32
00:02:15,560 --> 00:02:17,280
Accusing someone falsely
will bring retribution.

33
00:02:17,280 --> 00:02:19,960
Look, here it comes.

34
00:02:19,960 --> 00:02:21,280
You wicked woman.

35
00:02:21,280 --> 00:02:23,360
No one has ever dared
to treat me like that.

36
00:02:23,800 --> 00:02:25,000
I'll skin you alive.

37
00:02:26,640 --> 00:02:28,400
I've been putting up with you

38
00:02:28,400 --> 00:02:29,320
because you're family.

39
00:02:29,880 --> 00:02:30,960
Call me wicked one more time,

40
00:02:30,960 --> 00:02:32,280
I won't be so polite.

41
00:02:34,280 --> 00:02:35,400
Wicked, wicked,

42
00:02:35,400 --> 00:02:36,480
you're a wicked woman.

43
00:02:37,400 --> 00:02:38,200
You...

44
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:48,360
The scarf Moli gave me

45
00:02:48,640 --> 00:02:50,080
is really nice.

46
00:02:53,960 --> 00:02:54,960
What are you doing?

47
00:02:58,600 --> 00:03:00,120
I'm going to teach you

48
00:03:00,120 --> 00:03:01,480
how to behave.

49
00:03:09,840 --> 00:03:10,280
Moli,

50
00:03:10,280 --> 00:03:11,120
are you hurt?

51
00:03:12,160 --> 00:03:13,920
Zhiwei, you've gone too far.

52
00:03:14,240 --> 00:03:15,840
She was clearly bullying me.

53
00:03:16,800 --> 00:03:18,600
Yunzheng, help me fight back.

54
00:03:19,760 --> 00:03:20,800
Are you going to hit me too?

55
00:03:21,400 --> 00:03:22,240
As long as I'm here,

56
00:03:22,240 --> 00:03:23,360
no one can touch her.

57
00:03:23,720 --> 00:03:24,760
I won't allow it.

58
00:03:28,120 --> 00:03:29,720
We'll soon be family.

59
00:03:29,720 --> 00:03:30,440
Look at you.

60
00:03:30,880 --> 00:03:32,240
Your hair is all messed up.

61
00:03:32,640 --> 00:03:34,760
She tore my wedding dress.

62
00:03:34,760 --> 00:03:36,960
Such a vulgar dress doesn't suit you.

63
00:03:36,960 --> 00:03:38,560
I'll find a master craftsman

64
00:03:38,560 --> 00:03:39,560
to custom-make one for you.

65
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:42,200
Yunzheng, you're so kind.

66
00:03:43,480 --> 00:03:44,520
Moreover,

67
00:03:44,520 --> 00:03:46,320
it doesn't matter what dress I wear.

68
00:03:46,680 --> 00:03:48,800
What matters is the one by my side.

69
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:53,360
You have to be able to hold on to him.

70
00:03:54,360 --> 00:03:55,760
I won't disturb you anymore.

71
00:03:56,360 --> 00:03:57,960
Let's each prepare for our own weddings.

72
00:03:58,600 --> 00:03:59,360
Let's go.

We're here.

89
00:05:25,880 --> 00:05:27,000
What are you doing?

90
00:05:27,320 --> 00:05:28,920
I've noticed you haven't
been happy lately,

91
00:05:29,200 --> 00:05:30,680
so I wanted to capture
your happiest moments

92
00:05:31,240 --> 00:05:32,240
with a camera.

93
00:05:32,880 --> 00:05:33,760
This way,

94
00:05:34,200 --> 00:05:36,120
I can see the best of you every day.

95
00:05:42,160 --> 00:05:43,480
Yunzheng, look.

96
00:05:43,480 --> 00:05:45,560
These are the dowries my dad
prepared for me.

97
00:05:47,240 --> 00:05:48,160
Which one do you think

98
00:05:48,160 --> 00:05:50,080
would look best at the wedding?

99
00:05:50,080 --> 00:05:50,960
Up to you.

100
00:05:55,960 --> 00:05:57,080
How about this one?

101
00:06:14,160 --> 00:06:15,120
And this one?

102
00:06:16,720 --> 00:06:18,080
I have some matters to attend to.

103
00:06:18,080 --> 00:06:18,960
I'm heading back.

104
00:06:28,360 --> 00:06:29,480
Smile more naturally.

105
00:06:32,680 --> 00:06:33,720
Yes, very beautiful.

106
00:06:40,840 --> 00:06:41,400
Yunzheng,

107
00:06:42,880 --> 00:06:43,920
come help us out.

108
00:06:55,840 --> 00:06:56,840
Help take a picture of us.

109
00:06:57,240 --> 00:06:58,160
It won't take long.

110
00:07:06,960 --> 00:07:09,400
Three, two, one.

111
00:07:19,240 --> 00:07:20,240
Yunzheng, how is the picture?

112
00:07:26,680 --> 00:07:27,200
Fu Yunzheng,

113
00:07:27,440 --> 00:07:28,160
you did it on purpose.

114
00:07:29,440 --> 00:07:30,640
Tomorrow, I'll give you ten.

115
00:07:31,640 --> 00:07:32,840
Is it money that I care about?

116
00:07:33,640 --> 00:07:34,840
How can you compensate

117
00:07:35,320 --> 00:07:36,200
for our beautiful moments?

118
00:07:37,280 --> 00:07:38,280
Alright, Xize.

119
00:07:39,240 --> 00:07:40,600
I suddenly feel a bit cold.

120
00:07:42,760 --> 00:07:44,080
I'll go get you a coat.

121
00:08:05,960 --> 00:08:06,960
With the wedding coming,

122
00:08:08,480 --> 00:08:09,400
we should

123
00:08:09,400 --> 00:08:10,640
avoid meeting each other

124
00:08:11,520 --> 00:08:12,880
to prevent any accidents.

125
00:08:23,440 --> 00:08:24,200
I'll cover you up.

126
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:30,760
Tomorrow, I'll send a driver
to pick you up

127
00:08:30,760 --> 00:08:32,480
to check out the wedding banquet venue.

128
00:08:36,880 --> 00:08:37,360
Go,

129
00:08:38,720 --> 00:08:39,520
do something for me.

130
00:08:39,960 --> 00:08:40,320
Yes.

131
00:09:02,200 --> 00:09:03,360
Bro,

132
00:09:03,360 --> 00:09:04,240
when we arrive,

133
00:09:04,440 --> 00:09:05,200
can we

134
00:09:05,200 --> 00:09:07,160
have some fun with this girl?

135
00:09:07,160 --> 00:09:08,360
Otherwise, it'd be such a waste.

136
00:09:09,320 --> 00:09:10,600
That's not a problem.

137
00:09:10,600 --> 00:09:11,760
But I warn you,

138
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:13,800
the boss instructed us

139
00:09:13,800 --> 00:09:15,000
not to let her

140
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:16,320
return alive.

141
00:09:16,320 --> 00:09:17,160
Alright.

142
00:09:31,240 --> 00:09:32,040
Trying to run?

143
00:09:32,520 --> 00:09:33,760
Gather everyone.

144
00:09:33,760 --> 00:09:35,440
If we lose her, we're finished.

145
00:09:44,400 --> 00:09:45,160
Where's Moli?

146
00:09:45,760 --> 00:09:46,760
I didn't see her.

147
00:09:46,760 --> 00:09:48,560
Sir Xize, I was just knocked out.

148
00:09:57,960 --> 00:09:59,080
Send people to look for her.

149
00:09:59,080 --> 00:10:00,320
Turn the place upside down.

150
00:10:00,520 --> 00:10:01,280
Yes, sir.

151
00:10:14,200 --> 00:10:14,840
Sir Fu.

152
00:10:20,440 --> 00:10:21,360
Outside the city?

153
00:10:21,360 --> 00:10:22,520
Yes, Sir Fu.

154
00:10:22,880 --> 00:10:24,280
The car sped away.

155
00:10:24,280 --> 00:10:25,480
After they entered the bamboo forest,

156
00:10:25,480 --> 00:10:26,920
we lost track of her.

157
00:10:26,920 --> 00:10:28,520
Keep an eye on our goods.

158
00:10:28,520 --> 00:10:29,440
I'll go check.

159
00:10:51,840 --> 00:10:52,600
Where is she?

160
00:10:55,280 --> 00:10:56,040
Look ahead.

161
00:11:14,480 --> 00:11:16,000
Bro, I can see her.

162
00:11:21,560 --> 00:11:22,440
Stop right there!

163
00:11:27,960 --> 00:11:29,440
Finally caught you.

164
00:11:32,760 --> 00:11:34,280
Little girl,

165
00:11:34,680 --> 00:11:36,160
trying to run?

166
00:11:42,240 --> 00:11:43,840
You've got quite the strength, huh?

167
00:11:43,840 --> 00:11:44,840
My boys

168
00:11:44,840 --> 00:11:46,800
like girls like you.

169
00:11:48,880 --> 00:11:50,400
- Smells so good.
- The more you struggle,

170
00:11:51,120 --> 00:11:53,120
the more excited we get.

171
00:11:54,080 --> 00:11:55,400
What are you doing? Let go.

172
00:11:58,000 --> 00:11:59,320
So fair-skinned.

173
00:12:00,600 --> 00:12:01,920
Such a beauty.

174
00:12:28,040 --> 00:12:28,720
Go!

175
00:12:38,800 --> 00:12:40,120
Guys, let's go!

176
00:12:40,120 --> 00:12:41,560
Let's avenge our brother!

177
00:12:51,280 --> 00:12:52,280
There's no one here.

178
00:12:52,280 --> 00:12:53,080
Look over there.

179
00:12:53,080 --> 00:12:54,040
Yes.
