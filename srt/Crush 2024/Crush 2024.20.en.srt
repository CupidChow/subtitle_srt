Yue,

15
00:02:14,240 --> 00:02:15,440
you look pale.

16
00:02:15,880 --> 00:02:17,040
Are you too tired?

17
00:02:17,360 --> 00:02:19,240
Becoming the daughter of Master Shen

18
00:02:20,080 --> 00:02:21,720
can be hard to adapt.

19
00:02:22,040 --> 00:02:23,000
If you feel exhausted,

20
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:24,640
you can always return
to the Chiyan Gang.

21
00:02:24,640 --> 00:02:26,400
I'll handle everything else.

22
00:02:28,120 --> 00:02:30,640
The murderer who killed my mom

23
00:02:30,640 --> 00:02:32,840
is right here,

24
00:02:32,840 --> 00:02:34,800
but I can't catch him.

25
00:02:43,160 --> 00:02:45,680
I'll personally make the murderer pay.

26
00:02:51,400 --> 00:02:52,760
No matter who it is?

27
00:02:52,760 --> 00:02:54,360
No matter who it is.

28
00:02:56,440 --> 00:02:58,160
Once Shen Wende is eliminated,

29
00:02:58,680 --> 00:03:01,280
we can be together openly.

30
00:03:13,960 --> 00:03:16,200
Will we really be together forever?

31
00:03:16,200 --> 00:03:17,520
Of course.

32
00:03:21,480 --> 00:03:22,160
Be careful.

33
00:03:22,160 --> 00:03:24,040
Yes, especially with the calligraphy
and paintings,

34
00:03:24,040 --> 00:03:25,680
and those albums and the like.

35
00:03:25,680 --> 00:03:26,760
Be slow and careful.

36
00:03:28,440 --> 00:03:29,360
Keep them intact.

37
00:03:33,600 --> 00:03:34,600
Dad, this...

38
00:03:34,600 --> 00:03:36,280
Yue, you arrived at the right time.

39
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:38,440
This room is too small.

40
00:03:38,440 --> 00:03:39,960
I'll get you a bigger one.

41
00:03:40,320 --> 00:03:41,200
No need, dad.

42
00:03:41,200 --> 00:03:42,080
I'm used to this one.

43
00:03:42,640 --> 00:03:43,440
That won't do.

44
00:03:44,800 --> 00:03:46,160
We've just reunited.

45
00:03:47,040 --> 00:03:48,000

00:03:54,280 --> 00:03:54,600
Dad,

50
00:03:58,200 --> 00:03:59,920
I have something to discuss with you.

51
00:04:02,320 --> 00:04:03,560

Do you like it?

57
00:04:40,760 --> 00:04:42,280
You had a maid send me a message

58
00:04:42,760 --> 00:04:43,720
about something urgent.

59
00:04:44,280 --> 00:04:45,640
Turns out you prepared me a surprise.

61
00:04:54,640 --> 00:04:55,840

Fu Yunzheng,

126
00:09:19,560 --> 00:09:20,720
I've found out.

00:09:21,880 --> 00:09:23,040
My batch of goods

128
00:09:23,040 --> 00:09:24,440
was stolen by you.

129
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:28,760
Moreover,

00:09:29,680 --> 00:09:31,280
you and this Fu Yunyue

00:09:32,200 --> 00:09:33,640
are clearly siblings.

to deceive me.

00:09:37,560 --> 00:09:38,880
The enmity between you and me

135
00:09:39,200 --> 00:09:40,240
shouldn't affect others.

136

00:09:44,720 --> 00:09:45,320
Alright.

139
00:09:47,120 --> 00:09:48,360
If you want to protect this woman,

140
00:09:49,840 --> 00:09:51,520
exchange her for the Chiyan Token.

141
00:09:53,640 --> 00:09:54,560
That's no problem.

142
00:09:56,720 --> 00:09:57,400

143
00:09:57,400 --> 00:09:58,440
come and get it yourself.

144
00:10:05,440 --> 00:10:05,960
Stop.

145
00:10:06,960 --> 00:10:07,440
Let's go.

146
00:10:58,520 --> 00:10:59,520
Yue, you...

147
00:10:59,520 --> 00:11:00,760
Don't say my name.

148
00:11:01,640 --> 00:11:02,920
You killed my mother.

149
00:11:03,960 --> 00:11:05,240
You don't deserve to say my name.

150
00:11:06,320 --> 00:11:07,360
So, you know.

151
00:11:12,160 --> 00:11:12,960
Fu Yunzheng,

152
00:11:14,840 --> 00:11:16,040
if it weren't for my mom,

153
00:11:16,800 --> 00:11:18,600
you'd have been eaten
by wild dogs long ago.

154
00:11:20,240 --> 00:11:22,280
How could you bear to kill her?

155
00:11:27,520 --> 00:11:28,920
You've been a rich lady for too long.

156
00:11:30,160 --> 00:11:31,920
You really think you're one of them?

157
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:34,640
You've forgotten all the hardships
of the past.

158
00:11:36,160 --> 00:11:38,120
As an orphan who couldn't
even afford food,

159
00:11:38,520 --> 00:11:40,080
how else could I make money?

160
00:11:40,520 --> 00:11:41,720
Smuggling was my only option.

161
00:11:42,600 --> 00:11:43,840
And you killed my mom

162
00:11:45,840 --> 00:11:46,920
just to make money?

163
00:11:46,920 --> 00:11:48,240
She shouldn't have meddled.

164
00:11:49,720 --> 00:11:51,440
I kindly gave her stolen medicine,

165
00:11:51,440 --> 00:11:52,440
but she scolded me,

166
00:11:52,880 --> 00:11:54,000
even threatened to report me.

167
00:11:54,200 --> 00:11:55,240
She deserved to die.

168
00:11:55,240 --> 00:11:57,240
My mom was gravely ill.

169
00:11:57,680 --> 00:11:59,320
She couldn't have caught you.

170
00:11:59,920 --> 00:12:00,960
You could have run away

171
00:12:00,960 --> 00:12:02,040
or not save her.

172
00:12:02,040 --> 00:12:03,440
Why did you kill her?

173
00:12:04,720 --> 00:12:06,280
I didn't want to kill her at first,

174
00:12:07,480 --> 00:12:08,400
but who could have predicted

175
00:12:08,400 --> 00:12:09,160
Shen Wende

176
00:12:09,760 --> 00:12:11,960
would show up as a scapegoat?

177
00:12:12,280 --> 00:12:13,240
When you cut the grass,

178
00:12:13,440 --> 00:12:14,880
you must remove the roots.

179
00:12:18,200 --> 00:12:19,720
Because of your single thought,

180
00:12:20,680 --> 00:12:22,000
I lost my mom

181
00:12:23,040 --> 00:12:25,520
and nearly killed my biological father
by mistake.

182
00:12:28,200 --> 00:12:30,320
Blame your own fate.

183
00:12:30,600 --> 00:12:31,720
But rest assured,

184
00:12:32,800 --> 00:12:34,440
Shen Wende will also die.

185
00:12:35,080 --> 00:12:36,840
I'll personally kill him.

186
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:50,000
Do you know

187
00:12:52,640 --> 00:12:53,760
why no one came

188
00:12:53,760 --> 00:12:55,800
to rescue you during the past few days

189
00:12:57,240 --> 00:12:58,800
you went missing?

190
00:13:03,520 --> 00:13:04,440
You guessed it.

191
00:13:07,320 --> 00:13:10,640
Now all the waterways of the Chiyan Gang

192
00:13:11,720 --> 00:13:14,080
belong to our Shen family.

193
00:13:19,040 --> 00:13:20,720
You spent

194
00:13:20,720 --> 00:13:22,240
the past few days with me

195
00:13:23,360 --> 00:13:25,160
to distract me,

196
00:13:26,480 --> 00:13:28,280
so Shen Wende could seize my territory?

197
00:13:28,680 --> 00:13:29,480
Exactly.

198
00:13:30,960 --> 00:13:32,040
My dad took

199
00:13:32,040 --> 00:13:33,800
the Chiyan Token you handed him

200
00:13:34,280 --> 00:13:35,920
and boarded the Chiyan Gang's boat.

201
00:13:36,080 --> 00:13:38,240
And you, Fu Yunzheng,

202
00:13:39,280 --> 00:13:42,280
are worse than a stray dog.

203
00:13:42,680 --> 00:13:43,520
Fu Yunyue,

204
00:13:45,480 --> 00:13:46,680
you're evil.

205
00:13:47,280 --> 00:13:48,200
What about you?

206
00:13:49,440 --> 00:13:50,800
Compared to you, what am I?

207
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:54,040
Compared to you, I'm nothing.

208
00:13:55,600 --> 00:13:56,400
Fu Yunzheng,

209
00:13:58,200 --> 00:13:59,080
all these years,

210
00:14:00,520 --> 00:14:02,680
you toyed with me,

211
00:14:03,400 --> 00:14:05,440
watching me obey your every command.

212
00:14:05,440 --> 00:14:07,400
You must've been very pleased.

213
00:14:08,040 --> 00:14:09,160
You're not bad either.

214
00:14:10,040 --> 00:14:12,240
You were all lovey-dovey with Sir Xize

215
00:14:13,160 --> 00:14:15,160
while having an affair with me.

216
00:14:15,160 --> 00:14:16,960
You should thank me.

217
00:14:16,960 --> 00:14:18,240
If it weren't for me,

218
00:14:18,240 --> 00:14:20,080
you'd have married

219
00:14:20,080 --> 00:14:21,120
your own brother.

220
00:14:21,120 --> 00:14:23,080
It'd be an unthinkable atrocity.

221
00:14:23,080 --> 00:14:23,920
