14
00:01:15,320 --> 00:01:17,720
Is it deep sibling affection
between you two

15
00:01:19,040 --> 00:01:20,640
or is it romantic love?

16
00:01:21,120 --> 00:01:23,000
I think my father would be
interested to know.

17
00:01:27,280 --> 00:01:28,600
I have plenty of photos.

18
00:01:29,280 --> 00:01:30,320
If you like,

19
00:01:30,680 --> 00:01:31,600
they'll be spread all over

20
00:01:31,600 --> 00:01:33,400
every corner of Long City tomorrow.

21
00:01:36,320 --> 00:01:37,800
So the whole city will know

22
00:01:37,800 --> 00:01:39,120
what a good sister you have.

23
00:01:47,240 --> 00:01:48,240
What do you want?

24
00:01:58,600 --> 00:01:59,600
Can't you guess?

25
00:02:11,080 --> 00:02:12,040
It's simple.

26
00:02:15,720 --> 00:02:16,480
I want you.

27
00:02:19,440 --> 00:02:20,640
You should know

28
00:02:21,200 --> 00:02:22,240
our relationship

29
00:02:22,640 --> 00:02:24,680
hasn't reached the point
of sharing a bed.

30
00:02:26,160 --> 00:02:27,480
But right now,

31
00:02:28,160 --> 00:02:30,320
I just want to taste
the comfort of this bed.

32
00:02:34,080 --> 00:02:35,400
Yunzheng,

33
00:02:35,400 --> 00:02:38,240
a moment with you
is worth a thousand gold.

34
00:03:00,040 --> 00:03:01,840
(It turns out when the dream is over,)

35
00:03:02,360 --> 00:03:04,840
(you still have to return to reality.)

36
00:03:05,360 --> 00:03:08,080
(Everything is just
my wishful thinking.)

37
00:03:12,200 --> 00:03:13,440
Yunzheng.

38
00:03:17,760 --> 00:03:19,360
I also have a gift for you.

39
00:03:24,440 --> 00:03:25,960
If you push me further,

40
00:03:26,480 --> 00:03:27,800
this photo

41
00:03:28,360 --> 00:03:30,480
will be on the front page
of tomorrow's newspaper.

42
00:03:31,120 --> 00:03:32,720
The whole city will know

43
00:03:32,720 --> 00:03:34,720
about your and your dad's

44
00:03:34,720 --> 00:03:36,160
intimate relationship.

45
00:03:38,160 --> 00:03:39,760
So it was you.

46
00:03:40,440 --> 00:03:42,160
Do you really think anyone
would believe it?

47
00:03:45,640 --> 00:03:47,640
If she's in any danger,

48
00:03:47,640 --> 00:03:49,400
I'll turn the fake news

49
00:03:49,680 --> 00:03:50,960
into real news.

50
00:03:53,600 --> 00:03:55,280
Alright, Fu Yunzheng.

51
00:03:55,280 --> 00:03:57,560
If you are heartless, I'll be ruthless.

52
00:03:57,560 --> 00:03:58,840
Let's see who can endure more.

53
00:04:00,640 --> 00:04:01,840
If you want my bed so badly,

54
00:04:02,560 --> 00:04:03,880
tonight it's yours.

55
00:04:04,360 --> 00:04:05,520
You...

56
00:04:13,240 --> 00:04:14,120
Miss Zhiwei.

57
00:04:14,480 --> 00:04:15,520
Miss Zhiwei!

58
00:04:16,680 --> 00:04:17,600
if you know better,

59
00:04:17,600 --> 00:04:19,120
release her immediately.

60
00:04:19,120 --> 00:04:20,720
Master Shen might spare your life.

61
00:04:21,080 --> 00:04:22,120
To die together with her

62
00:04:22,120 --> 00:04:23,080
is worth it.

63
00:05:42,720 --> 00:05:44,920
(You'll be mine eventually.)

64
00:06:12,200 --> 00:06:12,800
Xize.

65
00:06:18,720 --> 00:06:19,520
Foreign paints?

66
00:06:19,920 --> 00:06:21,160
I searched for these

67
00:06:21,160 --> 00:06:22,680
for half a month in Long City.

68
00:06:23,480 --> 00:06:25,680
The merchant's ship docked
at the wharf yesterday.

69
00:06:26,040 --> 00:06:27,680
I waited there for them to unload.

70
00:06:28,080 --> 00:06:29,240
As soon as they came ashore,

71
00:06:29,240 --> 00:06:30,280
I brought the paints back.

72
00:06:35,920 --> 00:06:37,640
You waited at the wharf all night

73
00:06:37,640 --> 00:06:39,200
for this box of paints?

74
00:06:41,040 --> 00:06:42,040
It's not worth it.

75
00:06:42,040 --> 00:06:43,560
If it's something I like,

76
00:06:43,880 --> 00:06:45,000
I must get it.

77
00:06:45,640 --> 00:06:46,560
Besides,

78
00:06:46,880 --> 00:06:47,880
I want to give you

79
00:06:48,480 --> 00:06:48,960
the best.

80
00:06:54,400 --> 00:06:54,880
Xize,

81
00:06:56,080 --> 00:06:57,720
come to the garden tonight.

82
00:06:58,400 --> 00:06:59,600
I have something to tell you.

83
00:07:03,360 --> 00:07:04,120
OK.

84
00:07:25,400 --> 00:07:25,880
Moli.

85
00:07:28,920 --> 00:07:29,480
Xize,

86
00:07:32,760 --> 00:07:33,760
all these paintings

87
00:07:35,040 --> 00:07:37,040
are made with the paints you gave me.

88
00:07:38,120 --> 00:07:38,800
Aren't they pretty?

89
00:07:39,440 --> 00:07:39,920
They are.

90
00:07:42,760 --> 00:07:44,320
You only see their appearance,

91
00:07:44,880 --> 00:07:46,600
but you don't know what they represent.

92
00:07:48,240 --> 00:07:49,400
People are always like this.

93
00:07:51,040 --> 00:07:52,000
They don't know

94
00:07:52,640 --> 00:07:54,680
the truth and the inside

95
00:07:54,680 --> 00:07:56,360
are always quite the opposite.

96
00:07:57,440 --> 00:07:58,040
Xize,

97
00:07:58,600 --> 00:07:59,480
you and I

98
00:07:59,800 --> 00:08:01,360
aren't from the same world.

99
00:08:01,360 --> 00:08:02,000
I don't care.

100
00:08:02,360 --> 00:08:03,640
I just know I like you.

101
00:08:03,640 --> 00:08:05,120
I sincerely want to marry you.

102
00:08:06,360 --> 00:08:07,200
Xize,

103
00:08:07,640 --> 00:08:08,280
I can never

104
00:08:08,280 --> 00:08:09,600
give you my heart.

105
00:08:09,600 --> 00:08:10,480
It doesn't matter.

106
00:08:10,960 --> 00:08:11,960
I love you, and that's enough.

107
00:08:12,360 --> 00:08:12,880
Moli,

108
00:08:13,280 --> 00:08:14,840
I'll give you three seconds to consider.

109
00:08:15,240 --> 00:08:16,240
As long as you don't refuse,

110
00:08:16,600 --> 00:08:17,960
I'll take it as a yes.

111
00:08:17,960 --> 00:08:18,920
- Xize...
- Three, two, one.

112
00:08:19,760 --> 00:08:20,720
You didn't refuse.

113
00:08:21,040 --> 00:08:22,240
You agreed to marry me.

114
00:08:56,680 --> 00:08:57,640
I'm about to become

115
00:08:57,640 --> 00:08:58,680
the mistress of the Shen family.

116
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:00,360
Isn't it inappropriate for you

117
00:09:00,360 --> 00:09:01,240
to barge into my room?

118
00:09:01,520 --> 00:09:02,600
Who permitted you to marry him?

119
00:09:03,360 --> 00:09:04,640
Not only will I marry him,

120
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:06,800
I'll also be intimate with him.

121
00:09:07,120 --> 00:09:08,200
Just like you.

122
00:09:08,680 --> 00:09:09,880
I'll lie in the same bed

123
00:09:09,880 --> 00:09:11,080
with another man.

124
00:09:11,080 --> 00:09:12,080
I'm not like you.

125
00:09:12,080 --> 00:09:12,880
How are we different?

126
00:09:15,120 --> 00:09:15,880
Approaching Shen Zhiwei

127
00:09:15,880 --> 00:09:16,880
is for revenge.

128
00:09:17,040 --> 00:09:18,160
Marrying Shen Xize

129
00:09:18,160 --> 00:09:19,120
is also for revenge.

130
00:09:20,240 --> 00:09:21,840
Not only will I marry him,

131
00:09:21,840 --> 00:09:22,680
I'll also have his child.

132
00:09:22,680 --> 00:09:23,200
You...

133
00:09:26,200 --> 00:09:27,600
I won't allow it.

134
00:09:27,800 --> 00:09:29,360
I'll find another way to get the ledger.

135
00:09:29,360 --> 00:09:30,080
No need.

136
00:09:31,080 --> 00:09:32,320
I'll avenge mom myself.

137
00:09:32,880 --> 00:09:33,640
Don't trouble yourself.

138
00:09:41,920 --> 00:09:42,800
Sir Fu,

139
00:09:42,800 --> 00:09:44,280
Miss Shen has already left.

140
00:09:44,560 --> 00:09:45,760
You should go back too.

141
00:09:51,520 --> 00:09:52,480
Sir Fu,

142
00:09:52,480 --> 00:09:53,800
let's go back.

143
00:09:53,800 --> 00:09:54,800
The night is cold and dewy.

144
00:09:59,240 --> 00:10:00,040
This

145
00:10:01,200 --> 00:10:03,240
is the place where I first met her.

146
00:10:06,640 --> 00:10:07,760
Unfortunately,

147
00:10:08,360 --> 00:10:09,960
we can't go back.

148
00:10:13,720 --> 00:10:15,280
Help Sir Fu back.

149
00:10:15,280 --> 00:10:16,640
I'll go find Miss Yue.

150
00:10:27,320 --> 00:10:28,480
(Yunzheng,)

151
00:10:28,480 --> 00:10:31,200
(after tonight, you won't
be able to escape.)

152
00:11:18,680 --> 00:11:20,000
Yunzheng,

153
00:11:21,120 --> 00:11:22,760
are you feeling hot?

154
00:11:22,760 --> 00:11:23,800
Let me help you.

155
00:11:23,800 --> 00:11:24,920
What are you doing?

156
00:11:25,720 --> 00:11:27,360
We're engaged.

157
00:11:33,600 --> 00:11:35,280
Isn't it normal

158
00:11:41,440 --> 00:11:43,320
to have intimacy?

159
00:11:51,040 --> 00:11:51,760
You...

160
00:12:17,520 --> 00:12:18,160
Yunzheng,

161
00:12:18,160 --> 00:12:19,600
Wei Zhan said you were drunk.

162
00:12:19,840 --> 00:12:20,880
How did you get so drunk?

163
00:12:31,160 --> 00:12:31,800
Look carefully.

164
00:12:31,800 --> 00:12:33,000
I'm not Shen Zhiwei.

165
00:12:35,200 --> 00:12:36,080
Am I dreaming?

166
00:12:37,640 --> 00:12:38,680
You shouldn't be here.

167
00:12:39,440 --> 00:12:41,520
You shouldn't be in my dream.

168
00:12:45,920 --> 00:12:47,800
I don't want to wake up.

169
00:12:48,240 --> 00:12:50,480
This way you'll belong to me forever.
