31
00:04:15,640 --> 00:04:16,440
I'll find a doctor.

32
00:04:16,760 --> 00:04:17,560

33
00:04:20,240 --> 00:04:21,480
I'm so sorry.

34
00:04:21,480 --> 00:04:22,640
I didn't mean to.

35
00:04:23,080 --> 00:04:23,640
I'm sorry.

36
00:04:24,240 --> 00:04:25,760
I broke my promise.

37
00:04:26,920 --> 00:04:28,080
I didn't protect you well.

38
00:04:28,480 --> 00:04:30,440
No, no, no.

39
00:04:32,800 --> 00:04:35,680
It's all my fault.

40
00:04:36,680 --> 00:04:37,720
Fu Yunzhen, I beg you.

41
00:04:37,720 --> 00:04:39,120
Live on, please.

42
00:04:39,120 --> 00:04:41,280
I beg you.

43
00:04:43,480 --> 00:04:44,600
If you die now,

44
00:04:44,600 --> 00:04:45,960
I won't live alone either.

45
00:04:45,960 --> 00:04:46,800
Please.

46
00:04:48,200 --> 00:04:49,240
Such a small injury

47
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:51,320

I'm here.

Miss Yue, the doctor is here.

00:05:07,080 --> 00:05:08,000
Hurry, doctor.

56
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:08,880
Please help him.

57
00:05:08,880 --> 00:05:09,640
Let me take a look.

58
00:05:22,800 --> 00:05:23,400
Miss Yue,

59
00:05:24,440 --> 00:05:25,600
Sir Fu will be alright.

60
00:05:29,040 --> 00:05:30,040
Wei Zhan,

61
00:05:30,040 --> 00:05:31,400
tell me,

62
00:05:31,400 --> 00:05:33,160
what is Fu Yunzhen trying to do?

63
00:05:33,160 --> 00:05:35,360
Miss, please don't make it
difficult for me.

64
00:05:36,240 --> 00:05:37,720
You won't tell me, right?

65
00:05:38,920 --> 00:05:40,400
Then I'll ask Master Shen myself.

66
00:05:41,160 --> 00:05:41,920
Sir Fu did it for you.

67
00:05:49,400 --> 00:05:49,960
Actually,

68
00:05:51,400 --> 00:05:53,640
Sir Fu traced Master Shen
three years ago.

69
00:05:53,880 --> 00:05:55,000
He planned to use Shen Zhiwei

70
00:05:55,400 --> 00:05:56,000
to get close

71
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:57,240
and assassinate Master Shen.

72
00:05:57,560 --> 00:05:58,440
But he didn't expect

73
00:05:58,440 --> 00:05:59,280
an even bigger conspiracy

74
00:05:59,800 --> 00:06:01,040
lurking behind the Shen family.

75
00:06:02,680 --> 00:06:03,840
What conspiracy?

76
00:06:04,440 --> 00:06:05,640
Smuggle and treason.

77
00:06:08,920 --> 00:06:10,280
So,

78
00:06:10,280 --> 00:06:12,600
Fu Yunzhen's collusion with Master Shen

79
00:06:13,720 --> 00:06:14,760
is just an act?

80
00:06:17,680 --> 00:06:19,240
Sir Fu took all the hatred

81
00:06:19,240 --> 00:06:20,800
and infamy upon himself

82
00:06:21,560 --> 00:06:22,680
just to keep you out

83
00:06:22,680 --> 00:06:23,960
of this dangerous storm.

84
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:25,760
Miss Yue,

85
00:06:26,880 --> 00:06:27,320
please

86
00:06:28,360 --> 00:06:30,720
don't let Sir Fu's good intentions
go to waste.

87
00:06:43,200 --> 00:06:44,760
Doctor, how is he?

88
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:46,200
The bullet has been removed,

89
00:06:46,200 --> 00:06:47,360
and the bleeding has stopped.

90
00:06:47,360 --> 00:06:48,720
I'll prescribe some medicine.

91
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:50,520
He might have a fever tonight,

92
00:06:50,520 --> 00:06:51,360
so be very careful.

93
00:06:51,720 --> 00:06:53,200
The wound mustn't get infected.

94
00:06:53,680 --> 00:06:55,120
Is he out of danger?

95
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:57,560
I did my best,
and I'll leave the rest to fate.

96
00:06:58,680 --> 00:06:59,440
Whether he survives

97
00:06:59,920 --> 00:07:00,960
depends on his own will.

Fu Yunzhen killed Wang Hai

and left no survivors.

127
00:09:17,160 --> 00:09:18,200

138
00:09:43,920 --> 00:09:45,200
