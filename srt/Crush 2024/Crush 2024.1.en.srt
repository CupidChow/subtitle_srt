Yue,

15
00:02:38,920 --> 00:02:39,600
come with me.

16
00:02:40,840 --> 00:02:41,720
Yunzheng,

17
00:02:41,720 --> 00:02:42,960
why are you doing this?

18
00:02:43,160 --> 00:02:45,880
Anyone who wants to stop us
from being together

19
00:02:45,880 --> 00:02:46,640
must die.

20
00:02:46,640 --> 00:02:47,600
I'm your sister.

21
00:02:47,600 --> 00:02:49,040
You're my woman.

22
00:02:50,160 --> 00:02:51,120
Brother!

23
00:02:51,120 --> 00:02:52,480
Fu Yunzhen,

24
00:02:52,480 --> 00:02:53,720
wake up.

25
00:02:54,440 --> 00:02:56,040
From the moment I agreed to marry him,

26
00:02:56,040 --> 00:02:57,320
there wasn't any chance left for us.

27
00:02:57,320 --> 00:02:59,360
This is up to me.

28
00:03:00,320 --> 00:03:01,640
I don't care about the gossips

29
00:03:01,640 --> 00:03:02,880
or the misunderstanding.

30
00:03:02,880 --> 00:03:04,720
I only know we're destined
to be together

31
00:03:05,520 --> 00:03:06,560
lifetime after lifetime,

32
00:03:07,440 --> 00:03:08,480
and never to part.

33
00:03:11,440 --> 00:03:13,400
You were the one who pushed me away.

34
00:03:26,440 --> 00:03:27,840
You only have one choice,

35
00:03:28,480 --> 00:03:29,520
come with me.

36
00:03:33,200 --> 00:03:34,240
Let go of me.

37
00:03:49,980 --> 00:03:53,380
(Two months ago)

38
00:03:55,800 --> 00:03:56,600
- Sir Fu.
- Sir Fu.

39
00:04:05,280 --> 00:04:06,640
Tell me now.

40
00:04:09,840 --> 00:04:11,120
- Sir Fu.
- Sir Fu.

41
00:04:14,800 --> 00:04:15,520
Speak.

42
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:16,960
Where exactly is the thing?

43
00:04:23,200 --> 00:04:24,920
Don't think your Chiyan Gang

44
00:04:24,920 --> 00:04:26,200
can hide the truth.

45
00:04:26,480 --> 00:04:28,520
After I get out,

46
00:04:28,920 --> 00:04:30,160
I'll destroy you all.

47
00:04:40,720 --> 00:04:41,480
Sir Fu,

48
00:04:41,720 --> 00:04:42,480
these people

49
00:04:42,480 --> 00:04:43,520
are too stubborn.

50
00:05:12,280 --> 00:05:13,880
Before I finish cleaning up,

51
00:05:14,200 --> 00:05:15,560
if you still don't confess,

52
00:05:15,960 --> 00:05:18,280
you won't die as quickly as he did.

53
00:05:26,800 --> 00:05:28,440
I'll talk, I'll talk.

54
00:05:28,440 --> 00:05:29,360
The thing is...

55
00:05:33,080 --> 00:05:34,240
I've confessed everything.

56
00:05:34,520 --> 00:05:36,080
Just spare my life.

57
00:05:36,080 --> 00:05:37,240
Please spare me.

58
00:05:54,560 --> 00:05:55,720
Sir Fu, you're right.

59
00:05:55,720 --> 00:05:57,600
To deal with tough guys,
we have to be tougher.

60
00:05:57,600 --> 00:05:58,280
Sir Fu,

61
00:05:58,280 --> 00:05:58,920
bad news.

62
00:05:58,920 --> 00:06:00,320
Miss Yue is in trouble.

63
00:06:14,960 --> 00:06:16,200
Yue, come down.

64
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:18,680
Every year on the first day of snow,

65
00:06:20,160 --> 00:06:22,000
you'd be with me

66
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:23,040
to admire the snow,

67
00:06:23,040 --> 00:06:24,120
build snowmen,

68
00:06:24,520 --> 00:06:26,040
and eat roasted chestnuts.

69
00:06:28,040 --> 00:06:30,280
Why has everything changed now?

70
00:06:31,320 --> 00:06:32,280
Is it because of her?

71
00:06:32,280 --> 00:06:33,720
Who has been bad-mouthing me to you?

72
00:06:36,520 --> 00:06:38,240
I've been watching you all along.

73
00:06:38,520 --> 00:06:40,000
Do I need others to tell me

74
00:06:40,880 --> 00:06:42,560
whoever's around you?

75
00:06:42,560 --> 00:06:44,120
Don't be a child.

76
00:06:45,160 --> 00:06:46,280
Fu Yunzhen,

77
00:06:47,920 --> 00:06:49,400
take a good look.

78
00:06:50,640 --> 00:06:52,760
I've grown into a woman.

79
00:06:53,680 --> 00:06:54,720
You have no manners.

80
00:06:54,720 --> 00:06:55,760
I'm your brother.

81
00:06:56,560 --> 00:06:57,520
Brother?

82
00:06:59,880 --> 00:07:02,000
Then let me dance for you,

83
00:07:03,320 --> 00:07:04,880
to celebrate

84
00:07:05,600 --> 00:07:08,080
having

85
00:07:08,080 --> 00:07:09,640

Here, let me teach you.

93
00:07:51,280 --> 00:07:53,040
First, write the character for mountain.

94
00:07:56,120 --> 00:07:58,720
Then write the character for contend.

95
00:08:02,200 --> 00:08:03,520
I know how to write it.

96
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:04,880
Stop running.

97
00:08:05,800 --> 00:08:07,040
Come get me.

98
00:08:07,440 --> 00:08:08,400
Stop running.

100
00:08:21,080 --> 00:08:22,000
If there's a next time,

101
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:23,280
I'll lock you in a room for life.

102
00:08:23,280 --> 00:08:25,360
When mom died, you promised me

103
00:08:26,160 --> 00:08:27,720
to stay with me for life.

104
00:08:28,160 --> 00:08:31,000
But now we haven't found
the murderer of our mom,

105
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:32,280
you want to abandon me already.

106
00:08:43,360 --> 00:08:44,160
Wei Zhan,

107
00:08:45,960 --> 00:08:46,840
send her back.

108
00:09:02,240 --> 00:09:02,920
Miss,

109
00:09:03,280 --> 00:09:03,800
stop looking.

110
00:09:04,440 --> 00:09:05,680
At Sir Fu's age,

111
00:09:05,960 --> 00:09:07,640
it's only natural to have a wife.

112
00:09:08,400 --> 00:09:09,160
Let's go back.

113
00:09:11,200 --> 00:09:11,960
Without shoes,

114
00:09:12,800 --> 00:09:13,760
how can I walk?

115
00:09:31,440 --> 00:09:32,360
Please.

116
00:09:34,280 --> 00:09:35,280
Yunzhen,

117
00:09:35,280 --> 00:09:37,200
you're an hour late.

118
00:09:37,640 --> 00:09:38,400
Tell me,

119
00:09:39,080 --> 00:09:40,160
how should I punish you?

120
00:09:41,800 --> 00:09:42,840
In a few days,

121
00:09:42,840 --> 00:09:44,120
I'll hold a birthday party for you.

122
00:09:45,880 --> 00:09:47,000
That's more like it.

123
00:09:47,520 --> 00:09:48,680
I'll forgive you for now.

124
00:09:49,600 --> 00:09:50,160
Come,

125
00:09:50,160 --> 00:09:51,560
I've picked out a few suits for you.

126
00:10:18,240 --> 00:10:20,920
(If I weren't Fu Yunyue,)

127
00:10:22,400 --> 00:10:25,480
(In Loving Memory of Mother, Fu Yaru)
(could anything else happen between us?)

128
00:10:50,860 --> 00:10:54,260
(Maoyuan Store)

129
00:11:15,080 --> 00:11:16,040
It seems Miss Yue

130
00:11:16,040 --> 00:11:17,040
is really angry this time.

131
00:11:17,640 --> 00:11:19,080
She left home for five days.

132
00:11:19,080 --> 00:11:20,440
Luckily you had previously

133
00:11:20,440 --> 00:11:21,880
hidden her existence.

134
00:11:21,880 --> 00:11:23,080
If the enemies found out,

135
00:11:23,080 --> 00:11:24,080
it'd be trouble.

136
00:11:24,920 --> 00:11:25,640
Pass my order.

137
00:11:26,160 --> 00:11:26,920
All our brothers

138
00:11:27,520 --> 00:11:28,880
should search everywhere for her.

139
00:11:39,640 --> 00:11:40,360
Yunzhen.

140
00:11:41,600 --> 00:11:42,240
Let's go.

141
00:12:34,800 --> 00:12:35,720
Yunzhen,

142
00:12:36,160 --> 00:12:37,640
so you used the birthday party

143
00:12:37,640 --> 00:12:38,720
to propose to me.

144
00:12:40,280 --> 00:12:41,560
Sir Fu, you're really generous.

145
00:12:41,840 --> 00:12:43,400
You and Miss Shen are deeply in love.

146
00:12:43,600 --> 00:12:44,960
It makes us envious.

147
00:12:46,880 --> 00:12:49,200
Now the Chiyan Gang and the Shen family

148
00:12:49,200 --> 00:12:50,600
are joining forces.

149
00:12:50,600 --> 00:12:52,680
We'll wait to drink at your wedding.

150
00:12:59,720 --> 00:13:01,800
I'll marry you, Yunzhen.

151
00:13:01,800 --> 00:13:02,920
Put the ring on me.

152
00:13:04,240 --> 00:13:06,000
Are you so eager to marry me?

153
00:13:08,360 --> 00:13:09,240
Unfortunately,

154
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:11,240
such a small ring

155
00:13:11,960 --> 00:13:14,040
isn't worthy of my woman.

156
00:13:20,760 --> 00:13:22,080
It's a shame

157
00:13:22,480 --> 00:13:23,440
to throw away

158
00:13:23,440 --> 00:13:24,360
