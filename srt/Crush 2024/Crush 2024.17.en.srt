14
00:01:23,320 --> 00:01:24,880
Is this the result you wanted?

15
00:01:26,960 --> 00:01:28,480
You decided to advance the wedding

16
00:01:29,400 --> 00:01:30,960
without consulting me.

17
00:01:30,960 --> 00:01:32,400
If one person must be sacrificed

18
00:01:32,400 --> 00:01:33,280
to get the ledger,

19
00:01:33,840 --> 00:01:35,160
that person can only be me.

20
00:01:40,960 --> 00:01:43,160
Now, we hold the wedding together.

21
00:01:44,200 --> 00:01:45,560
We can cooperate better,

22
00:01:46,400 --> 00:01:47,840
since we can't predict

23
00:01:48,720 --> 00:01:49,760
what's hidden in the hall.

24
00:01:50,080 --> 00:01:51,440
I don't want you to marry someone else.

25
00:01:52,080 --> 00:01:52,880
If you refuse...

26
00:01:52,880 --> 00:01:54,200
Changing plans at the last minute

27
00:01:54,200 --> 00:01:55,520
will complicate everything.

28
00:01:55,680 --> 00:01:56,800
But when thinking about someone

29
00:01:58,160 --> 00:01:59,680
spending the wedding night with you,

30
00:01:59,680 --> 00:02:00,240
I want to kill

31
00:02:00,240 --> 00:02:01,640
everyone here.

32
00:02:28,040 --> 00:02:28,840
Moli.

33
00:02:36,960 --> 00:02:37,760
Moli.

34
00:02:39,640 --> 00:02:40,360
Moli.

35
00:02:44,640 --> 00:02:45,640
According to tradition,

36
00:02:45,640 --> 00:02:46,400
I can't see you

37
00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:47,080
before the wedding.

38
00:02:48,120 --> 00:02:49,000
I couldn't resist

39
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:49,840
coming to see you.

40
00:02:59,600 --> 00:03:00,680
Traditions can't be broken,

41
00:03:01,680 --> 00:03:02,680
right?

42
00:03:03,640 --> 00:03:05,000
Why don't you go back inside?

43
00:03:05,840 --> 00:03:06,400
Moli,

44
00:03:07,640 --> 00:03:08,320
when will you

45
00:03:08,320 --> 00:03:09,120
be willing to kiss me?

46
00:03:11,480 --> 00:03:12,560
We...

47
00:03:12,560 --> 00:03:13,440
We're about to get married,

48
00:03:13,440 --> 00:03:14,800
aren't we?

49
00:03:23,840 --> 00:03:24,520
Yes.

50
00:03:25,240 --> 00:03:26,240
I was too impatient.

51
00:03:27,240 --> 00:03:28,120
I'll go back now.

52
00:03:28,760 --> 00:03:29,240
Sure.

53
00:03:55,360 --> 00:03:56,800
Yesterday you wanted to call it off,

54
00:03:56,960 --> 00:03:58,400
and today you've changed your mind.

55
00:04:00,080 --> 00:04:02,320
That's not like you, Yunzheng.

56
00:04:07,720 --> 00:04:08,480
I wonder

57
00:04:08,480 --> 00:04:10,520
if you really want to marry me

58
00:04:11,680 --> 00:04:13,600
or if it's just to protect her.

59
00:04:13,720 --> 00:04:14,920
No matter the reason,

60
00:04:16,760 --> 00:04:18,160
the result is the same.

61
00:04:18,680 --> 00:04:19,960
Unless you don't want to marry me.

62
00:04:20,360 --> 00:04:22,440
In that case, I can negotiate
with the Shen family.

63
00:04:26,560 --> 00:04:28,480
Of course, I want to marry you.

64
00:04:30,440 --> 00:04:31,200
After all,

65
00:04:33,360 --> 00:04:34,720
we're the same kind of people.

66
00:05:00,840 --> 00:05:01,600
Sir Fu,

67
00:05:01,880 --> 00:05:03,560
everything has been arranged.

68
00:05:05,760 --> 00:05:06,360
Good.

69
00:05:21,280 --> 00:05:22,120
Mr. Wang,

70
00:05:22,120 --> 00:05:22,600
hello.

71
00:05:22,600 --> 00:05:24,000
Welcome, come in.

72
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:24,840
Please, come inside.

73
00:05:26,360 --> 00:05:27,160
Thank you.

74
00:05:27,600 --> 00:05:28,760
Mr. Liu, please come in.

75
00:05:28,760 --> 00:05:29,200
Please.

76
00:05:29,200 --> 00:05:30,320
Thank you.

77
00:05:42,320 --> 00:05:42,960
Yunzheng,

78
00:05:44,880 --> 00:05:45,840
you shouldn't be here.

79
00:05:46,240 --> 00:05:47,480
Remember when we were kids,

80
00:05:48,080 --> 00:05:49,800
you always wanted to play house with me.

81
00:05:52,920 --> 00:05:54,120
When we played a couple,

82
00:05:54,920 --> 00:05:56,640
I was the one to put on your veil.

83
00:05:57,760 --> 00:05:59,240
I think today should be no exception.

84
00:06:15,080 --> 00:06:15,760
Yunzheng,

85
00:06:15,960 --> 00:06:17,680
you don't have any other plans, do you?

86
00:06:26,600 --> 00:06:27,600
What are you doing here?

87
00:06:30,120 --> 00:06:31,000
Don't be nervous.

88
00:06:31,640 --> 00:06:32,960
I'm just here to remind you,

89
00:06:33,560 --> 00:06:35,320
Yunzheng will soon be mine.

90
00:06:35,920 --> 00:06:37,760
If you don't know your place,

91
00:06:38,360 --> 00:06:39,720
I'll make your life in my family

92
00:06:39,720 --> 00:06:41,000
a living hell.

93
00:06:45,640 --> 00:06:46,400
You...

94
00:06:48,160 --> 00:06:49,400
Only the victor

95
00:06:49,400 --> 00:06:50,880
gets to choose the spoils.

96
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:53,520
Throwing away something unwanted

97
00:06:53,880 --> 00:06:54,640
is no loss.

98
00:06:56,040 --> 00:06:57,520
Moli, it's time.

99
00:07:36,880 --> 00:07:37,720
Dear guests,

100
00:07:38,240 --> 00:07:40,680
welcome to witness the wedding
of these two couples.

101
00:07:41,200 --> 00:07:43,080
Please, face each other.

102
00:07:45,640 --> 00:07:46,200
Groom,

103
00:07:46,600 --> 00:07:47,200
bride,

104
00:07:47,880 --> 00:07:49,200
will you

105
00:07:49,520 --> 00:07:50,480
take this person before you

106
00:07:51,040 --> 00:07:53,760
to be your spouse

107
00:07:54,280 --> 00:07:55,280
from this day forward

108
00:07:55,800 --> 00:07:58,200
for richer or for poorer

109
00:07:58,200 --> 00:07:59,840
in sickness and in health

110
00:07:59,840 --> 00:08:02,120
to love

111
00:08:02,120 --> 00:08:03,480
and to cherish

112
00:08:03,960 --> 00:08:06,480
until death do you part?

113
00:08:10,760 --> 00:08:11,640
I do.

114
00:08:17,560 --> 00:08:18,440
I...

115
00:08:20,200 --> 00:08:21,080
She doesn't.

116
00:08:25,200 --> 00:08:25,600
Let's go!

117
00:08:27,480 --> 00:08:28,240
Fu Yunzheng!

118
00:08:28,680 --> 00:08:30,120
I dare you both to leave.

119
00:08:31,720 --> 00:08:33,160
Fu Yunzheng, you're crazy.

120
00:08:33,160 --> 00:08:34,160
Let Moli go.

121
00:08:34,520 --> 00:08:35,400
Yunzheng.

122
00:09:37,160 --> 00:09:38,000
Xize.

123
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:38,880
Xize, wake up.

124
00:09:39,680 --> 00:09:40,480
Xize.

125
00:09:41,320 --> 00:09:42,440
Xize, wake up.

126
00:09:43,040 --> 00:09:43,640
Xize.

127
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:46,760
Xize!

128
00:10:38,520 --> 00:10:39,720
Yue, come with me.

129
00:10:40,960 --> 00:10:41,840
Yunzheng,

130
00:10:41,840 --> 00:10:43,080
why are you doing this?

131
00:10:43,280 --> 00:10:45,920
Anyone who tries to stop us
from being together

132
00:10:45,920 --> 00:10:46,760
must die.

133
00:10:46,760 --> 00:10:47,720
I'm your sister.

134
00:10:47,720 --> 00:10:49,160
You're my woman.

135
00:10:50,360 --> 00:10:51,240
Brother.

136
00:10:51,240 --> 00:10:52,600
Fu Yunzheng!

137
00:10:52,600 --> 00:10:53,840
Come to your senses.

138
00:10:54,560 --> 00:10:56,160
From the moment I agreed to marry him,

139
00:10:56,160 --> 00:10:57,440
there was no chance for us.

140
00:10:57,440 --> 00:10:59,000
Whether there is or not is up to me.

141
00:11:00,440 --> 00:11:01,760
I don't care about public opinion

142
00:11:01,760 --> 00:11:03,000
or societal norms.

143
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:04,840
I only know we're destined
to be together,

144
00:11:05,400 --> 00:11:06,440
forever

145
00:11:07,440 --> 00:11:08,600
and always.

146
00:11:11,560 --> 00:11:13,720
You're the one who pushed me to others.

147
00:11:27,520 --> 00:11:28,920
You have only one choice,

148
00:11:29,560 --> 00:11:30,600
to come with me.

149
00:11:34,280 --> 00:11:35,320
Let go of me.

150
00:11:50,680 --> 00:11:51,760
I do.

151
00:11:59,800 --> 00:12:00,520
I do.

152
00:12:05,120 --> 00:12:05,920
I do.

153
00:12:06,440 --> 00:12:07,320
I declare

154
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:08,800
the ceremony is over.

155
00:12:17,880 --> 00:12:19,520
Thank you all for coming.

156
00:12:20,280 --> 00:12:21,280
Tomorrow

157
00:12:21,280 --> 00:12:23,440
is a grand day for the Shen family.

158
00:12:23,440 --> 00:12:24,600
We'll open the ancestral hall.

159
00:12:25,640 --> 00:12:26,480
Once

160
00:12:26,480 --> 00:12:27,520
the marriage certificate

161
00:12:27,520 --> 00:12:29,120
is signed, sealed

162
00:12:29,120 --> 00:12:30,480
and placed in the ancestral hall,

163
00:12:30,960 --> 00:12:31,720
they

164
00:12:31,720 --> 00:12:34,880
will be part of the Shen family.

165
00:12:34,880 --> 00:12:36,560
Please join us

166
00:12:36,560 --> 00:12:38,040
to witness this.

167
00:12:58,800 --> 00:12:59,840
Yunzheng.

168
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:52,080
Yunzheng.

169
00:13:52,560 --> 00:13:54,360
You're finally mine.

170
00:14:00,440 --> 00:14:01,960
Why did you drink so much?

171
00:14:02,600 --> 00:14:03,480
Moli.

172
00:14:07,720 --> 00:14:08,560
