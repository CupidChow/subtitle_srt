You can't let him get away with it.

24
00:02:01,120 --> 00:02:02,760
So, what do you think

25
00:02:02,760 --> 00:02:03,960
I should do?

26
00:02:07,440 --> 00:02:08,680
We should join forces

27
00:02:09,680 --> 00:02:11,640
and take back the goods
Fu Yunzheng stole.

28
00:02:12,040 --> 00:02:13,920

Why driving so fast?

180
00:11:05,640 --> 00:11:07,640
Someone gave me ten silver coins

181
00:11:07,640 --> 00:11:09,320
to drive fast in the city.

182
00:11:09,320 --> 00:11:10,200
All the money is here.

183
00:11:10,200 --> 00:11:11,040

is the plan

190
00:11:37,120 --> 00:11:38,120
going smoothly?

191
00:11:38,680 --> 00:11:39,720
No problem.

192
00:11:40,400 --> 00:11:41,720
My dad's death

193
00:11:41,720 --> 00:11:43,520
is connected to all of you.

194
00:11:48,960 --> 00:11:50,120
As far as I know,

195
00:11:50,480 --> 00:11:51,920
your enemy

196
00:11:52,480 --> 00:11:54,920
is already with your wife.

197
00:11:54,920 --> 00:11:56,440
He stole your wife.

198
00:11:56,720 --> 00:11:58,120
You wouldn't

199
00:11:58,520 --> 00:12:00,680
be magnanimous enough
to ignore it, right?

200
00:12:00,960 --> 00:12:02,880
As long as we can get back

201
00:12:02,880 --> 00:12:04,760
the weapons from Fu Yunzheng,

202
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:06,600
we both will be saved.

203
00:12:12,120 --> 00:12:14,440
I can help you retrieve those weapons,

204
00:12:14,960 --> 00:12:16,120
but in exchange,

205
00:12:16,720 --> 00:12:18,920
you must eliminate Fu Yunzheng
and the Chiyan Gang.

206
00:12:23,960 --> 00:12:25,840
Of course, I want to kill Fu Yunzheng.

207
00:12:26,160 --> 00:12:26,960
But

208
00:12:27,720 --> 00:12:30,440
it's not that easy to deal with him.

209
00:12:32,720 --> 00:12:34,240
You don't need to worry about that.

210
00:12:35,440 --> 00:12:37,040
I know Fu Yunzheng's

211
00:12:37,600 --> 00:12:38,840
weakness.

212
00:12:50,520 --> 00:12:51,560
Sir Fu, what's this?

213
00:12:51,560 --> 00:12:52,360
Yue's bracelet.

214
00:12:52,880 --> 00:12:53,960
Her bracelet?

215
00:12:53,960 --> 00:12:55,640
How did it end up on the road
to our gang?

216
00:12:56,360 --> 00:12:57,000
Oh no.

217
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:58,280
We've been lured away.

218
00:12:59,600 --> 00:13:01,560
I'll make your eyebrows thicker.

219
00:13:08,960 --> 00:13:10,320
And don't forget

220
00:13:10,320 --> 00:13:11,440
the lipstick.

221
00:13:15,640 --> 00:13:17,480
Yes, just like this.

222
00:13:18,240 --> 00:13:19,880
When I first saw you,

223
00:13:20,440 --> 00:13:23,000
you were like a newly blooming
jasmine flower.

224
00:13:28,440 --> 00:13:29,720
Shen Xize,

225
00:13:29,720 --> 00:13:32,480
you colluded with the Japanese
to besiege the Chiyan Gang.

226
00:13:32,480 --> 00:13:33,520
You traitor!

227
00:13:34,480 --> 00:13:35,560
You're treacherous

228
00:13:35,560 --> 00:13:36,760
and a disgrace to the country.

229
00:13:36,760 --> 00:13:37,840
Don't touch me!

230
00:13:39,760 --> 00:13:40,600
