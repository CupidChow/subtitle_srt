You hurt me.

00:01:32,160 --> 00:01:33,520
Why did you ask me

17
00:01:33,520 --> 00:01:34,720
to come here so late?

I have a big announcement to make.

I like you.

26
00:02:03,160 --> 00:02:04,840
Fu Yunzhen, I like you.

27

Who is this?

40
00:03:19,920 --> 00:03:20,800
Zhiwei,

41
00:03:20,800 --> 00:03:21,760
did I miss anything?

42
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:23,840
She is...

43
00:03:24,200 --> 00:03:25,440
Let me formally introduce.

44
00:03:26,280 --> 00:03:27,200
This is my girlfriend,

45
00:03:27,200 --> 00:03:27,880
Moli.

46
00:03:38,160 --> 00:03:39,560
Change out of those dirty clothes.

47
00:03:39,560 --> 00:03:41,560
You can choose any clothes here.

48
00:03:41,560 --> 00:03:42,320
Thank you.

49
00:03:42,320 --> 00:03:43,480
I'll head out then.

50
00:04:14,160 --> 00:04:14,880
Who is it?

51
00:04:47,280 --> 00:04:49,520
Miss Shen's boyfriend

52
00:04:50,280 --> 00:04:52,240
likes to watch others change?

53
00:04:57,880 --> 00:04:58,720
Have you done enough?

54
00:05:00,360 --> 00:05:01,440
I'm not joking.

55
00:05:01,440 --> 00:05:03,080
How do you know Shen Xize?

56
00:05:03,840 --> 00:05:05,160
None of your business.

57
00:05:05,160 --> 00:05:07,480
Fu Yunyue, what exactly do you want?

58
00:05:08,480 --> 00:05:09,920
Fu Yunzhen,

59
00:05:09,920 --> 00:05:11,360
you know exactly what I want.

60
00:05:12,560 --> 00:05:14,440
(Fu Yunzhen, I like you.)

61
00:05:17,160 --> 00:05:18,560
(Do you like me?)

62
00:05:19,120 --> 00:05:21,320
(I'll be waiting for your answer.)

63
00:05:24,840 --> 00:05:26,040
I'll say it again,

64
00:05:26,480 --> 00:05:28,320
a sister will always be a sister,

65
00:05:28,320 --> 00:05:30,120
and a brother will always be a brother.

66
00:05:31,520 --> 00:05:32,320
Fine,

67
00:05:33,240 --> 00:05:34,920
then I'll tell you.

68
00:05:34,920 --> 00:05:36,840
Now I've changed everything

69
00:05:36,840 --> 00:05:38,360
from the inside out, even my name.

70
00:05:38,360 --> 00:05:40,160
I'm not your sister now,

71
00:05:40,160 --> 00:05:41,520
but a woman.

72
00:05:42,440 --> 00:05:44,440
Stop being unreasonable.

73
00:05:47,760 --> 00:05:49,280
I'll marry another man,

74
00:05:50,160 --> 00:05:52,040
just like you'll marry another woman.

75
00:05:55,440 --> 00:05:57,840
It seems over the years
I've spoiled you.

76
00:05:59,720 --> 00:06:00,520
Wei Zhan.

77
00:06:02,720 --> 00:06:03,520
Sir Fu.

78
00:06:05,440 --> 00:06:06,760
Take Miss Yue back to the gang.

79
00:06:06,760 --> 00:06:07,800
Keep her under strict guard.

80
00:06:08,240 --> 00:06:09,160
If she runs away again,

81
00:06:09,760 --> 00:06:11,080
don't come back.

82
00:06:26,520 --> 00:06:27,000
Sir Shen.

83
00:06:27,640 --> 00:06:28,200
Moli,

84
00:06:28,320 --> 00:06:29,080
what's going on?

85
00:06:36,200 --> 00:06:37,680
I was just changing
in the dressing room.

86
00:06:37,960 --> 00:06:39,040
They suddenly barged in,

87
00:06:39,680 --> 00:06:40,760
and we started arguing.

88
00:06:42,040 --> 00:06:42,640
Fu Yunzhen,

89
00:06:43,080 --> 00:06:44,280
even if you're my brother-in-law,

90
00:06:44,560 --> 00:06:45,720
you can't bully my woman.

91
00:06:47,640 --> 00:06:48,400
Your woman?

92
00:06:48,800 --> 00:06:49,440
Of course.

93
00:06:50,880 --> 00:06:52,480
Stop, stop!

94
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:53,800
Stop!

95
00:06:53,800 --> 00:06:55,120
- Go get the money!
- Freeze!

96
00:06:57,520 --> 00:06:59,120
Move, move!

97
00:07:03,200 --> 00:07:04,040
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

98
00:07:04,040 --> 00:07:04,880
Miss, they're after me.

99
00:07:04,880 --> 00:07:05,800
If we don't catch him today,

100
00:07:05,800 --> 00:07:06,680
- we're doomed.
- Sir Shen?

101
00:07:06,680 --> 00:07:08,000
Let's go!

102
00:07:09,440 --> 00:07:10,240
Come with me.

103
00:07:15,520 --> 00:07:16,360
Where is he?

104
00:07:16,640 --> 00:07:17,440
Go find him.

105
00:07:17,840 --> 00:07:18,480
Go.

106
00:07:33,520 --> 00:07:34,920
(My name is Moli.)

107
00:07:36,280 --> 00:07:37,840
(What about you?)

108
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:44,080
Moli saved my life.

109
00:07:46,400 --> 00:07:47,640
She's an extraordinary girl.

110
00:07:48,640 --> 00:07:49,040
So,

111
00:07:49,440 --> 00:07:50,480
no one can bully her,

112
00:07:50,920 --> 00:07:52,160
including you, Fu Yunzhen.

113
00:08:12,080 --> 00:08:12,720
Yunzhen.

114
00:08:13,920 --> 00:08:14,760
I've been looking for you.

115
00:08:15,120 --> 00:08:15,840
Why are you here?

116
00:08:19,040 --> 00:08:20,080
It's OK, Sir Shen.

117
00:08:20,600 --> 00:08:22,080
Maybe they entered the wrong room.

118
00:08:22,440 --> 00:08:23,280
Let's go.

119
00:08:30,280 --> 00:08:31,080
Do you

120
00:08:31,400 --> 00:08:32,440
know that Moli?

121
00:08:33,840 --> 00:08:34,560
No.

122
00:08:50,840 --> 00:08:51,680
I thought

123
00:08:51,680 --> 00:08:53,720
I'd bring you here as a thank you gift.

124
00:08:53,720 --> 00:08:55,440
I didn't expect to almost
get you harassed.

125
00:08:56,440 --> 00:08:57,760
Sir Shen,

126
00:08:57,760 --> 00:08:59,440
how can this be your fault?

127
00:08:59,760 --> 00:09:01,200
If you consider me a friend,

128
00:09:01,200 --> 00:09:02,400
you can call me Xize.

129
00:09:03,400 --> 00:09:04,200
Xize.

130
00:09:05,560 --> 00:09:06,800
Master Shen is here.

131
00:09:11,720 --> 00:09:12,880
Wait for me.

132
00:09:53,400 --> 00:09:54,080
(It's him.)

133
00:09:54,880 --> 00:09:56,640
(He's the one who killed my mom.)

134
00:09:56,840 --> 00:09:58,080
- Dad.
- Dad.

135
00:09:58,720 --> 00:10:00,040
Alright.

136
00:10:00,640 --> 00:10:01,440
Yunzhen,

137
00:10:01,960 --> 00:10:03,800
the longevity wine you gave me last time

138
00:10:03,800 --> 00:10:04,640
was excellent.

139
00:10:04,640 --> 00:10:06,080
It has a strong fragrance.

140
00:10:06,360 --> 00:10:07,680
Glad you like it, uncle.

141
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:09,000
There's plenty more.

142
00:10:10,760 --> 00:10:11,520
Good.

143
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:12,800
Everyone,

144
00:10:13,160 --> 00:10:13,840
today,

145
00:10:14,360 --> 00:10:17,200
to celebrate my daughter's birthday,

146
00:10:18,040 --> 00:10:20,880
I've prepared a surprise.

147
00:10:23,480 --> 00:10:24,880
Now, please follow me

148
00:10:24,880 --> 00:10:26,040
to witness it.

149
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:29,160
Alright.

150
00:11:10,680 --> 00:11:12,400
The fireworks are so beautiful.

151
00:11:13,800 --> 00:11:15,680
Beautiful, right, Zhiwei?

152
00:11:15,680 --> 00:11:16,400
Very pretty.

153
00:12:21,240 --> 00:12:22,560
You knew all along,

154
00:12:23,320 --> 00:12:24,240
didn't you?

155
00:13:05,920 --> 00:13:06,720
Moli,

156
00:13:07,920 --> 00:13:08,840
are you alright?

157
00:13:08,840 --> 00:13:09,640
How's your foot?

158
00:13:11,560 --> 00:13:12,560
It's just a small injury.

159
00:13:13,120 --> 00:13:14,120
Still, don't ignore it.

160
00:13:14,360 --> 00:13:15,760
I'll take you for a proper check-up.

161
00:13:32,840 --> 00:13:33,880
Don't get me wrong.

162
00:13:33,880 --> 00:13:35,120
I was concerned about your injury,

163
00:13:35,120 --> 00:13:36,120
and got a bit anxious.

164
00:13:36,520 --> 00:13:37,520
I'll find a doctor.

165
00:13:55,760 --> 00:13:57,760
Don't you owe me

166
00:13:57,760 --> 00:13:59,200
an explanation for what you did?

167
00:14:01,160 --> 00:14:02,400
I don't need to explain myself

168
00:14:02,400 --> 00:14:04,400
to you.

169
00:14:08,440 --> 00:14:09,200
Fine.

170
00:14:09,720 --> 00:14:10,480
Fu Yunzhen,

171
00:14:10,800 --> 00:14:12,320
since you don't want to explain to me,

172
00:14:13,240 --> 00:14:14,600
then explain to mom.

173
00:14:24,920 --> 00:14:26,000
In a month,

174
00:14:26,600 --> 00:14:28,520
it'll be the 15th anniversary
of mom's death.

175
00:14:30,760 --> 00:14:31,560
Fu Yunzhen,

176
00:14:32,320 --> 00:14:33,880
do you remember

177
00:14:33,880 --> 00:14:35,240
how mom died?

178
00:14:37,200 --> 00:14:38,520
Do you remember

179
00:14:39,240 --> 00:14:40,960
we swore

180
00:14:40,960 --> 00:14:42,680
to avenge mom here?

181
00:14:55,320 --> 00:14:57,680
Why didn't you tell me
when you found the murderer?

182
00:14:58,880 --> 00:14:59,880
Fu Yunzhen,

183
00:15:00,960 --> 00:15:02,600
do you have any reason for this,

184
00:15:05,600 --> 00:15:07,000
or have you really fallen

185
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:08,480
for the enemy's daughter

186
00:15:08,480 --> 00:15:09,440
and can't do it yourself?

187
00:15:12,680 --> 00:15:14,040
I have my plans.

188
00:15:17,960 --> 00:15:19,440
You have plans?

189
00:15:21,920 --> 00:15:23,920
You always say you have your plans.

190
00:15:24,520 --> 00:15:25,660
You always keep me in the dark,

191
00:15:26,080 --> 00:15:27,800
making me feel like a fool.

192
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:36,000
Fu Yunzhen, I'm telling you.

193
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:37,020
I'll never back down

194
00:15:38,120 --> 00:15:39,480
on the matter of revenge.

195
00:15:39,840 --> 00:15:41,480
Since you have your plans,

196
00:15:41,920 --> 00:15:43,080
I also have my ways.

197
00:15:43,960 --> 00:15:46,680
I'll personally cut

198
00:15:46,680 --> 00:15:48,840
Shen Wende into pieces

199
00:15:48,840 --> 00:15:49,880
to avenge our mom.

200
00:15:53,640 --> 00:15:54,560
Put me down!

201
00:15:54,560 --> 00:15:55,360
You jerk!

202
00:15:56,760 --> 00:15:57,880
Let me down!

203
00:16:00,680 --> 00:16:01,480
Let go of me!

204
00:16:03,240 --> 00:16:04,040
Let go!

205
00:16:12,560 --> 00:16:13,480
You hit me!

206
00:16:13,760 --> 00:16:14,840
I hit you

207
00:16:14,840 --> 00:16:16,440
because you disappeared for no reason.

208
00:16:18,640 --> 00:16:19,840
I hit you

209
00:16:19,840 --> 00:16:21,240
because you disrespected your brother.

210
00:16:24,040 --> 00:16:25,160
I hit you

211
00:16:25,480 --> 00:16:26,920
because you overestimated yourself.

212
00:16:28,880 --> 00:16:30,280
How could you hit me?

213
00:16:30,280 --> 00:16:32,040
You no longer have the right
to discipline me.

214
00:16:33,440 --> 00:16:34,760
Well then, it seems I have to exercise

215
00:16:34,760 --> 00:16:36,320
the right I have to discipline you.
