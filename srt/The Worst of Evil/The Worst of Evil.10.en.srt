00:00:01,793 --> 00:00:08,591
THE CHARACTERS, PLACES, ORGANIZATIONS AND
EVENTS IN THIS DRAMA ARE WORKS OF FICTION

2
00:00:21,479 --> 00:00:22,480
Boss.

3
00:00:23,106 --> 00:00:24,399
Let's go grab some soju.

4
00:00:33,658 --> 00:00:36,703
Why didn't you tell me...

5
00:00:39,539 --> 00:00:40,790
about the Japanese?

6
00:00:40,874 --> 00:00:42,667
You handled the Chinese situation.

7
00:00:43,168 --> 00:00:44,502
So I should handle the Japanese.

8
00:00:45,962 --> 00:00:47,589
It all worked out, anyway.

9
00:00:48,173 --> 00:00:49,924
Sorry I didn't tell you sooner.

10
00:00:51,926 --> 00:00:53,219
About Lee Haeryun.

11
00:00:53,303 --> 00:00:54,596
How's it going with her?

12
00:00:55,263 --> 00:00:56,639
She's just...

13
00:00:57,724 --> 00:00:58,767
a business partner.

14
00:00:59,642 --> 00:01:00,769
Nothing more.

15
00:01:01,519 --> 00:01:05,148
Come on, man.
You know you can tell me anything.

16
00:01:14,574 --> 00:01:18,036
Now that I think about it,
everything went well.

17
00:01:19,245 --> 00:01:21,039
The Chinese guys trust you,

18
00:01:22,248 --> 00:01:25,210
and the old geezer
I've been dealing with is gone now.

19
00:01:26,461 --> 00:01:28,379
We now have a new Japanese connection,

20
00:01:30,173 --> 00:01:32,342
so it'll be a good place for you to start.

21
00:01:35,595 --> 00:01:37,138
Start what?

22
00:01:38,515 --> 00:01:39,849
What do you mean, sir?

23
00:01:39,933 --> 00:01:41,643
Once this thing wraps up,

24
00:01:42,185 --> 00:01:43,937
I'm walking away from this business.

25
00:01:44,020 --> 00:01:45,021
What?

26
00:01:45,105 --> 00:01:50,401
Then, you'll be in charge of it.

27
00:01:51,861 --> 00:01:52,862
Boss.

28
00:01:52,946 --> 00:01:54,739
I have a new goal now.

29
00:01:57,700 --> 00:01:58,910
A normal life.

30
00:02:00,495 --> 00:02:02,288
I just want to be a normal man

31
00:02:03,248 --> 00:02:04,916
living a safe and secure life.

32
00:02:09,796 --> 00:02:12,132
I've never had this thought before.

33
00:02:14,509 --> 00:02:16,386
But ever since I met Euijeong again,

34
00:02:17,595 --> 00:02:21,057
I've kept thinking about what I should do

35
00:02:21,141 --> 00:02:22,976
to be someone who's worthy of her.

36
00:02:24,853 --> 00:02:27,814
So from now on,
I'll show her that I've changed

37
00:02:28,731 --> 00:02:30,859
and I'll live an honest, law-abiding life.

38
00:02:30,942 --> 00:02:31,985
Boss.

39
00:02:34,195 --> 00:02:35,238
(SIGHS)

40
00:02:39,868 --> 00:02:40,994
You see,

41
00:02:41,828 --> 00:02:44,330
Euijeong is a cop. You know that.

42
00:02:46,040 --> 00:02:47,709
You're going to keep dating a cop?

43
00:02:50,420 --> 00:02:51,421
Yes, she's a cop.

44
00:02:52,714 --> 00:02:55,383
That's why I want to be a person
who's worthy of her.

45
00:03:01,973 --> 00:03:03,683
Chief Seo is too short-tempered,

46
00:03:04,851 --> 00:03:07,270
and Heesung has a lot
on his mind after having his kid.

47
00:03:09,022 --> 00:03:10,690
Seungho, you're the perfect fit.

48
00:03:17,113 --> 00:03:18,281
I'm sure you'll do well.

49
00:03:19,199 --> 00:03:20,200
I believe in you.

50
00:03:34,589 --> 00:03:40,845
THE WORST OF EVIL

51
00:03:43,806 --> 00:03:44,807
Boss.

52
00:03:46,100 --> 00:03:48,978
Are you really
getting out of this business?

53
00:03:49,771 --> 00:03:51,356
It's why I'm headed here.

54
00:03:53,233 --> 00:03:54,442
Isn't this good for you?

55
00:04:12,919 --> 00:04:14,295
Are you waiting for someone?

56
00:04:16,798 --> 00:04:17,799
Euijeong.

57
00:04:21,678 --> 00:04:23,054
I see. You invited Euijeong.

58
00:04:23,137 --> 00:04:24,472
Bit by bit, I'll show her

59
00:04:25,265 --> 00:04:26,557
how I change.

60
00:04:28,810 --> 00:04:29,811
Hey, you made it.

61
00:04:30,603 --> 00:04:31,813
So Seungho's here, too.

62
00:04:32,563 --> 00:04:33,564
Yes.

63
00:04:33,648 --> 00:04:35,900
How's your wound? Are you okay?

64
00:04:37,735 --> 00:04:38,778
Yes.

65
00:04:39,153 --> 00:04:41,239
-Let's go inside.
-Okay.

66
00:04:46,703 --> 00:04:49,580
This Free International City
and airport construction plan

67
00:04:49,706 --> 00:04:53,418
aims to make the greater Yeongjong area
the center of East Asian trade

68
00:04:53,501 --> 00:04:57,088
as the largest hub of the 21st century.

69
00:04:57,672 --> 00:05:01,050
The total estimated cost
of the project is 132.9 billion won,

70
00:05:01,134 --> 00:05:06,973
and the construction period
will last from 1995 to 2001.

71
00:05:07,432 --> 00:05:10,018
Now, I'm going to show you current photos

72
00:05:10,101 --> 00:05:12,270
of Yeongjongdo, Yongyudo,
and Muuido Islands.

73
00:05:12,353 --> 00:05:14,272
You'll also see concept drawings

74
00:05:14,355 --> 00:05:17,442
of the Free International City
and new airport after completion

75
00:05:17,525 --> 00:05:20,945
in comparison on the slides.

76
00:05:21,029 --> 00:05:22,280
The slides, please.

77
00:05:25,283 --> 00:05:27,201
(WHISPERS) That's where we went.
Muuido Island.

78
00:05:29,454 --> 00:05:33,249
And that's Yeongjongdo Island next to it.

79
00:05:34,125 --> 00:05:37,295
MAN: Right now, it's only busy
during the summer,

80
00:05:37,378 --> 00:05:40,590
but when this deal's wrapped up,
people will be visiting...

81
00:05:41,132 --> 00:05:43,676
And the Marine Tourism Complex
is next to it.

82
00:05:45,178 --> 00:05:47,680
Secondly, if you look
at the illustrations,

83
00:05:48,598 --> 00:05:50,808
the International Fishing Village is

84
00:05:50,892 --> 00:05:54,354
at the center
of the Marine Tourism Complex.

85
00:05:54,437 --> 00:05:56,314
MINGOO: (SOFTLY)
You must have made a fortune

86
00:05:56,397 --> 00:05:58,775
to invest in this kind of business. Right?

87
00:06:01,110 --> 00:06:02,653
By the way, what are you going to do?

88
00:06:04,364 --> 00:06:05,615
I'm talking about Yankees.

89
00:06:07,700 --> 00:06:11,329
Where did you hide him? You're putting me
through a wild fucking goose chase.

90
00:06:11,412 --> 00:06:12,413
Come on.

91
00:06:13,414 --> 00:06:15,375
If you continue to stay quiet,

92
00:06:16,209 --> 00:06:18,336
I'll keep following you around like this.

93
00:06:23,174 --> 00:06:27,637
(SNORTS) Wait. Did you off Yankees, too?

94
00:06:28,596 --> 00:06:29,806
Like you did with Cho?

95
00:06:31,265 --> 00:06:34,143
Could you please maintain
some class for the occasion?

96
00:06:37,522 --> 00:06:40,024
(WHISPERS) Sure. I'll speak quietly.

97
00:06:41,567 --> 00:06:43,236
Hey.

98
00:06:43,319 --> 00:06:44,320
Too bad, though.

99
00:06:45,238 --> 00:06:46,614
I know

100
00:06:47,198 --> 00:06:50,076
you're the owner of Gangnam Crystal.

101
00:06:51,160 --> 00:06:54,831
I'm sure they'll go easier
on a drug crime than murder.

102
00:06:55,665 --> 00:06:59,043
Why don't you quit the drug trade
and turn yourself in?

103
00:07:00,336 --> 00:07:03,965
Then, I'll turn a blind eye
to Manager Cho's murder.

104
00:07:04,799 --> 00:07:05,967
No more digging.

105
00:07:09,512 --> 00:07:11,055
I'm not sure what you're saying.

106
00:07:16,185 --> 00:07:18,729
I'm giving you a piece of fucking advice.

107
00:07:20,565 --> 00:07:22,191
Leave the drug trade

108
00:07:22,775 --> 00:07:25,319
to the losers.

109
00:07:25,403 --> 00:07:27,405
You're too good for it.

110
00:07:28,531 --> 00:07:30,074
Let the losers do it.

111
00:07:38,916 --> 00:07:40,334
Just do as I say.

112
00:07:41,085 --> 00:07:44,172
Then, I'll look into why Mr. Cheon died

113
00:07:44,964 --> 00:07:48,092
as a thank-you gift.

114
00:07:57,977 --> 00:08:00,271
MAN: We're making history, so to speak.

115
00:08:01,147 --> 00:08:05,818
Next, let me introduce
our most steady and leading investor

116
00:08:05,902 --> 00:08:08,488
in the tourism and entertainment district.

117
00:08:08,571 --> 00:08:11,657
The CEO of Gangnam Industry,
Jung Gicheul, will say a few words.

118
00:08:12,033 --> 00:08:13,159
Whoo!

119
00:08:14,785 --> 00:08:16,913
Ah! Come on.

120
00:08:18,164 --> 00:08:22,168
Ah! Mr. Jung! Mr. Jung Gicheul!

121
00:08:23,377 --> 00:08:26,005
Mr. Jung! Mr. Jung!

122
00:08:26,088 --> 00:08:28,132
Bravo! Here he comes!

123
00:08:28,216 --> 00:08:31,594
Mr. Jung! Here he comes!
(LAUGHS)

124
00:08:35,973 --> 00:08:37,391
Hello.

125
00:08:38,100 --> 00:08:39,185
Man, what is this?

126
00:08:40,186 --> 00:08:41,854
"Grande Joie"?

127
00:08:41,938 --> 00:08:43,481
Sounds good. Hmm?

128
00:08:44,857 --> 00:08:46,067
Bravo!

129
00:08:49,070 --> 00:08:50,404
(WHISPERS) Let's go.

130
00:08:50,488 --> 00:08:53,199
Hey, did you scan their faces?

131
00:08:53,282 --> 00:08:54,909
Yes, I took photos of them all.

132
00:08:54,992 --> 00:08:55,993
Great.

133
00:08:56,869 --> 00:08:58,079
That tastes damn good.

134
00:09:02,583 --> 00:09:03,876
Hello.

135
00:09:03,960 --> 00:09:06,170
My name is Jung Gicheul
of Gangnam Industry.

136
00:09:06,796 --> 00:09:10,132
Since our host did such a wonderful job
with the explanation,

137
00:09:10,216 --> 00:09:12,635
I'll keep it simple and short.

138
00:09:13,553 --> 00:09:18,474
The Free International City's districts,
such as the business district and...

139
00:09:18,558 --> 00:09:19,559
(SIGHS)

140
00:09:19,684 --> 00:09:22,895
Are you going to let Hwang Mingoo
keep sticking his nose in everywhere?

141
00:09:22,979 --> 00:09:26,148
He even fucking saw
Euijeong's face just now.

142
00:09:27,066 --> 00:09:30,194
Shouldn't we keep that crazy bastard
on a leash or something?

143
00:09:32,154 --> 00:09:35,241
If that bastard Hwang Mingoo

144
00:09:35,324 --> 00:09:37,285
arrests Jung Gicheul before we do,

145
00:09:38,369 --> 00:09:40,997
all the work we've done
will go down the drain.

146
00:09:41,747 --> 00:09:44,542
We'll all be fucking screwed!
Do you get it?

147
00:09:45,167 --> 00:09:47,044
Let's get it together.
(DISCONNECTS)

148
00:09:49,880 --> 00:09:53,092
Doesn't it seem like Hwang Mingoo
heard from Jaegeon Group

149
00:09:53,676 --> 00:09:55,845
about Jung Gicheul's drug trafficking?

150
00:09:55,928 --> 00:09:56,929
Yes.

151
00:09:57,054 --> 00:10:00,266
(SIGHS WEARILY)
He's such a pain in the ass.

152
00:10:02,977 --> 00:10:04,562
Hello, sir.

153
00:10:04,645 --> 00:10:06,314
CHANGSIK: It's about
Detective Hwang Mingoo.

154
00:10:06,397 --> 00:10:07,398
Yes, sir.

155
00:10:07,481 --> 00:10:09,859
He keeps getting in the way of our work.

156
00:10:11,319 --> 00:10:13,988
How may I help you with that, sir?

157
00:10:14,071 --> 00:10:17,241
Keep me updated
with his activities every day.

158
00:10:17,325 --> 00:10:21,495
Also, tell him to take it easy. Eh?

159
00:10:21,579 --> 00:10:23,205
Okay?

160
00:10:23,706 --> 00:10:24,999
Yes, sir.

161
00:10:25,082 --> 00:10:26,626
I'll keep you updated. Bye.

162
00:10:27,752 --> 00:10:29,086
(BOTH SIGH)

163
00:10:34,759 --> 00:10:35,968
(FOOTSTEPS APPROACHING)

164
00:10:36,510 --> 00:10:37,720
HAERYUN: Everyone's here early.

165
00:10:42,183 --> 00:10:45,311
This is Seungho's girlfriend,
Ms. Lee Haeryun.

166
00:10:46,187 --> 00:10:49,398
And this is my girlfriend,
Ms. Yu Euijeong.

167
00:10:49,482 --> 00:10:50,816
Nice to meet you.

168
00:10:58,074 --> 00:10:59,283
We've met before, right?

169
00:11:01,369 --> 00:11:02,411
Nice to meet you.

170
00:11:04,038 --> 00:11:06,082
I heard you two went to the same school.

171
00:11:06,165 --> 00:11:07,291
Please sit down.

172
00:11:09,794 --> 00:11:11,170
I heard you were a cop.

173
00:11:12,380 --> 00:11:13,714
So are you a corrupt cop?

174
00:11:19,970 --> 00:11:22,098
(CHUCKLES) Just kidding.

175
00:11:23,182 --> 00:11:25,768
I heard you even shot a gun
to save Mr. Jung's life.

176
00:11:26,644 --> 00:11:27,895
You must really love him.

177
00:11:29,772 --> 00:11:31,565
EUIJEONG: Haeryun,
what do you do for work?

178
00:11:31,649 --> 00:11:33,484
It's not rude to ask, right?

179
00:11:34,985 --> 00:11:36,320
I make drugs.

180
00:11:43,327 --> 00:11:46,247
(LAUGHING) I'm just kidding.

181
00:11:49,667 --> 00:11:50,876
Did you believe that?

182
00:11:51,419 --> 00:11:52,795
But you're a cop.

183
00:11:52,878 --> 00:11:53,879
That's so adorable.

184
00:11:54,296 --> 00:11:56,340
GICHEUL: Haeryun's father
is Korean-Chinese.

185
00:11:56,424 --> 00:11:57,633
And we're pretty close.

186
00:11:57,717 --> 00:12:00,428
He's looking to invest
in culinary businesses in Seoul.

187
00:12:00,511 --> 00:12:02,430
They're Korean-Chinese. I see.

188
00:12:02,513 --> 00:12:03,514
Where in China?

189
00:12:05,015 --> 00:12:06,600
GICHEUL: Beijing.

190
00:12:06,684 --> 00:12:10,604
Haeryun is helping
her father with finance.

191
00:12:10,980 --> 00:12:12,231
And in long term,

192
00:12:12,314 --> 00:12:14,692
she's hoping to invest
in real estate in Korea.

193
00:12:14,775 --> 00:12:15,776
He's right.

194
00:12:16,610 --> 00:12:19,655
Money is all I have.

195
00:12:20,197 --> 00:12:22,616
It must be nice to be rich.

196
00:12:24,827 --> 00:12:26,871
You two must be so in love.

197
00:12:26,954 --> 00:12:30,708
It's not easy to get back together
after going out in high school.

198
00:12:34,086 --> 00:12:36,547
The first time must've left
a really strong impression.

199
00:12:43,053 --> 00:12:44,054
Wasn't that funny?

200
00:12:46,807 --> 00:12:48,017
You're a tough crowd.

201
00:12:48,809 --> 00:12:50,060
I guess it's a cop thing.

202
00:12:56,358 --> 00:12:58,736
I guess it's because you work
in a family business.

203
00:12:58,819 --> 00:13:00,029
She's really funny.

204
00:13:02,782 --> 00:13:04,909
So are you two in a relationship now?

205
00:13:09,413 --> 00:13:11,957
Well, we are...

206
00:13:12,041 --> 00:13:14,710
In terms of business,

207
00:13:14,794 --> 00:13:16,837
-we're deeply...
-I like him a lot.

208
00:13:27,056 --> 00:13:28,224
How about you, Seungho?

209
00:13:36,398 --> 00:13:38,484
Don't say it out loud. It's cheesy.

210
00:13:41,028 --> 00:13:42,238
What about you, Euijeong?

211
00:13:44,114 --> 00:13:45,950
Is it okay for you to date Mr. Jung?

212
00:13:46,033 --> 00:13:47,910
-You're a cop.
-Why not?

213
00:13:49,662 --> 00:13:51,705
You know what Mr. Jung does.

214
00:13:53,165 --> 00:13:54,583
Don't you get judged for it?

215
00:13:55,417 --> 00:13:56,418
What do you mean?

216
00:13:58,712 --> 00:14:00,589
Whatever Gicheul does

217
00:14:02,299 --> 00:14:05,386
or has been doing doesn't matter to me.

218
00:14:06,136 --> 00:14:07,888
He promised he'd change.

219
00:14:10,724 --> 00:14:11,976
And I believe that.

220
00:14:19,650 --> 00:14:21,402
This is fun.

221
00:14:21,735 --> 00:14:22,987
But I have to go.

222
00:14:23,529 --> 00:14:25,531
Watching what I say isn't really my thing.

223
00:14:26,574 --> 00:14:28,367
How about we go and get a drink?

224
00:14:30,744 --> 00:14:32,329
This was fun, Euijeong.

225
00:14:46,051 --> 00:14:48,470
I'm actually not interested
in real estate.

226
00:14:52,433 --> 00:14:54,560
In my grandfather's motherland,

227
00:14:55,978 --> 00:14:58,022
I want to study, work,

228
00:14:59,690 --> 00:15:02,860
date, and be successful.

229
00:15:04,153 --> 00:15:05,863
Like regular Koreans.

230
00:15:09,325 --> 00:15:10,576
That's all I want.

231
00:15:12,703 --> 00:15:13,746
And hopefully with you.

232
00:15:29,428 --> 00:15:30,429
Hello.

233
00:15:31,138 --> 00:15:32,181
How much for an apple?

234
00:15:32,264 --> 00:15:34,016
Three thousand won for five.

235
00:15:35,935 --> 00:15:37,353
I want this one.

236
00:15:37,436 --> 00:15:39,563
I like the red color better.

237
00:15:39,647 --> 00:15:41,482
We'll take five red apples.

238
00:15:42,232 --> 00:15:45,235
In China, people love
to receive apples as gifts.

239
00:15:46,403 --> 00:15:47,404
Why?

240
00:15:47,488 --> 00:15:51,033
Because they're the symbol of peace.

241
00:15:55,913 --> 00:15:57,665
Here you are.

242
00:15:57,748 --> 00:16:01,502
Remember when Mr. Jung gave me a watch

243
00:16:01,585 --> 00:16:03,170
when I first arrived in Korea?

244
00:16:03,253 --> 00:16:05,255
In China, we never give watches as gifts.

245
00:16:08,008 --> 00:16:11,220
It means you'll die when it stops.

246
00:16:21,814 --> 00:16:22,815
Is it good?

247
00:16:24,525 --> 00:16:26,944
It's so good. Thank you.

248
00:16:31,782 --> 00:16:32,783
I'm sorry.

249
00:16:33,951 --> 00:16:35,119
What?

250
00:16:35,202 --> 00:16:37,079
About Lee Haeryun.

251
00:16:37,162 --> 00:16:38,288
It was so rude of her.

252
00:16:40,708 --> 00:16:41,709
It's okay.

253
00:16:42,251 --> 00:16:43,335
I understand.

254
00:16:44,503 --> 00:16:46,380
But we won't have to see her again.

255
00:16:49,383 --> 00:16:50,384
What do you mean?

256
00:16:51,051 --> 00:16:52,511
You saw the investment pitch.

257
00:16:54,680 --> 00:16:57,975
From now on,
I'll only introduce you to good people.

258
00:17:05,733 --> 00:17:07,067
I promised I would change,

259
00:17:08,193 --> 00:17:09,445
and I intend to keep it.

260
00:17:15,034 --> 00:17:16,660
(FOOTSTEPS APPROACH)

261
00:17:39,975 --> 00:17:40,976
Haeryun.

262
00:17:42,186 --> 00:17:45,689
I'd like to see you for a long time.

263
00:17:46,899 --> 00:17:48,317
So to do that,

264
00:17:49,943 --> 00:17:53,238
how about we keep
a little distance between us?

265
00:17:53,947 --> 00:17:55,074
For now, at least.

266
00:17:55,699 --> 00:17:56,909
Distance?

267
00:17:58,994 --> 00:17:59,995
Like this much?

268
00:18:02,372 --> 00:18:03,373
Or...

269
00:18:04,208 --> 00:18:05,250
this much?

270
00:18:07,044 --> 00:18:08,170
(CHUCKLES SOFTLY)

271
00:18:09,922 --> 00:18:12,382
All right. We do have to
see each other for a long time.

272
00:18:17,971 --> 00:18:19,932
I'm going to live in Korea from now on.

273
00:18:24,394 --> 00:18:25,813
I got my father's permission, too.

274
00:18:29,483 --> 00:18:30,484
Where did you get this?

275
00:18:30,567 --> 00:18:31,693
RESIDENT REGISTRATION CARD

276
00:18:31,777 --> 00:18:34,363
From now on,
I'm not Korean-Chinese Lee Haeryun.

277
00:18:34,446 --> 00:18:36,198
I'm Korean Lee Sunyoung.

278
00:18:40,410 --> 00:18:41,537
What are you thinking?

279
00:18:47,084 --> 00:18:49,545
Whenever you're with me,
you seem distracted.

280
00:18:52,047 --> 00:18:53,048
I do?

281
00:18:53,132 --> 00:18:54,133
Yes.

282
00:18:57,219 --> 00:18:58,428
Do you think about work?

283
00:18:59,263 --> 00:19:00,264
Or...

284
00:19:02,224 --> 00:19:03,392
someone else?

285
00:19:07,521 --> 00:19:08,814
I'm not sure about that.

286
00:19:10,983 --> 00:19:13,360
Couldn't it be that I'm bad
at expressing feelings?

287
00:19:16,363 --> 00:19:17,781
Do you even have feelings for me?

288
00:19:19,241 --> 00:19:20,242
Oh.

289
00:19:21,285 --> 00:19:22,828
If you haven't felt them,

290
00:19:22,911 --> 00:19:25,330
it means I'm really bad
at expressing them.

291
00:19:28,417 --> 00:19:30,085
Seungho, when you're with me,

292
00:19:31,879 --> 00:19:33,714
I want your undivided attention.

293
00:19:35,799 --> 00:19:36,884
You know...

294
00:19:40,137 --> 00:19:43,223
I like you a lot.

295
00:19:53,984 --> 00:19:55,861
Am I getting your attention now?

296
00:20:00,574 --> 00:20:03,660
This is just all so confusing to me.

297
00:20:04,578 --> 00:20:05,579
What is?

298
00:20:09,249 --> 00:20:10,334
It's just...

299
00:20:11,210 --> 00:20:12,711
I think

300
00:20:13,879 --> 00:20:15,047
I might like you

301
00:20:16,924 --> 00:20:18,508
even more than I thought...

302
00:20:21,011 --> 00:20:22,346
from now on.

303
00:20:38,320 --> 00:20:39,613
MINGOO: Hey, sit down.

304
00:20:39,738 --> 00:20:40,781
Come on. Sit.

305
00:20:41,531 --> 00:20:44,952
Let's put the puzzle pieces together.

306
00:20:45,535 --> 00:20:47,663
Manager Cho, Yankees,

307
00:20:48,121 --> 00:20:50,332
Mr. Cheon, Gangnam Union.

308
00:20:50,707 --> 00:20:53,001
-What do they have in common?
-What?

309
00:20:53,085 --> 00:20:54,086
It's drugs.

310
00:20:54,795 --> 00:20:55,796
Oh.

311
00:20:56,296 --> 00:20:58,882
I'm so glad you're here.

312
00:20:59,299 --> 00:21:03,679
I mean, you should know the big names

313
00:21:03,762 --> 00:21:05,889
in the drug trade better than I would.

314
00:21:06,682 --> 00:21:07,683
You're right.

315
00:21:07,766 --> 00:21:09,851
(ALL LAUGH HYSTERICALLY)

316
00:21:09,935 --> 00:21:10,978
Right?

317
00:21:11,061 --> 00:21:13,522
Let's fucking write down all their names!

318
00:21:13,605 --> 00:21:14,773
Whatever comes to mind.

319
00:21:14,856 --> 00:21:17,567
Just try to squeeze
all the names out of your memories.

320
00:21:17,651 --> 00:21:19,945
-Yes, sir!
-We have to fucking find Manager Cho.

321
00:21:20,028 --> 00:21:22,114
-Yes, sir!
-All right.

322
00:21:22,197 --> 00:21:25,409
Write down everything about people
who make, sell, and buy drugs.

323
00:21:25,492 --> 00:21:26,868
Their names, nicknames,

324
00:21:26,952 --> 00:21:28,870
addresses, and even family relations.

325
00:21:28,954 --> 00:21:30,372
-Okay?
-BOTH: Yes, sir!

326
00:21:30,455 --> 00:21:32,916
MINGOO: Every fucking thing, okay?
BOTH: Yes, sir!

327
00:21:33,917 --> 00:21:35,752
These names are dope.

328
00:21:35,836 --> 00:21:38,672
"Gullebang Bridge." Fuck. "Godori."

329
00:21:39,381 --> 00:21:40,590
Meth Park.

330
00:21:41,216 --> 00:21:42,718
You forgot Meth Park.

331
00:21:43,260 --> 00:21:44,553
-Mr. Meth Park.
-Right!

332
00:21:45,971 --> 00:21:47,472
-Meth Park?
-There's a saying

333
00:21:47,556 --> 00:21:49,850
that all drugs in Gangnam

334
00:21:49,933 --> 00:21:52,853
go to Meth Park
before they go to customers.

335
00:21:52,936 --> 00:21:54,146
That's how famous he is.

336
00:21:54,229 --> 00:21:57,190
I'm sure even Yankees can't sell the stuff

337
00:21:57,274 --> 00:21:58,525
without his verification.

338
00:21:58,608 --> 00:22:02,696
So this guy named Meth Park
must be meeting with Yankees, right?

339
00:22:02,779 --> 00:22:04,114
That's right.

340
00:22:04,197 --> 00:22:05,449
So what are you doing?

341
00:22:05,532 --> 00:22:08,118
-What?
-Call Meth Park!

342
00:22:08,869 --> 00:22:10,954
-Call him!
-Come on.

343
00:22:11,580 --> 00:22:12,789
Call him now.

344
00:22:13,749 --> 00:22:15,917
Hi. It's me, Dodgers.

345
00:22:16,585 --> 00:22:20,630
I got 10 packs of imported snacks.

346
00:22:20,714 --> 00:22:23,050
Would you be interested in trying some?

347
00:22:23,842 --> 00:22:26,970
They taste absolutely amazing.

348
00:22:27,596 --> 00:22:29,056
Page me if you're interested.

349
00:22:31,141 --> 00:22:32,225
Are you done?

350
00:22:32,309 --> 00:22:34,770
Mingoo, can I call my girlfriend?

351
00:22:36,855 --> 00:22:39,900
Hey, keep him locked up
until Meth Park contacts us.

352
00:22:39,983 --> 00:22:41,651
Yes, sir. Get up.

353
00:22:49,284 --> 00:22:50,369
Kwon Seungho.

354
00:22:50,452 --> 00:22:51,453
Yes, sir?

355
00:22:51,536 --> 00:22:54,539
How was the date with Lee Haeryun? Good?

356
00:22:54,623 --> 00:22:56,458
You bastard. You got laid, right?

357
00:22:56,541 --> 00:22:57,667
He totally got laid.

358
00:22:58,502 --> 00:23:00,879
This is why I wanted to go.

359
00:23:01,421 --> 00:23:02,756
Let's eat.

360
00:23:05,467 --> 00:23:06,468
Have a seat.

361
00:23:07,135 --> 00:23:09,554
The Chinese and Japanese issues

There's a place called Jinpo Port
in Jeolla Province.

We sail out from there, get the stuff,

370
00:23:44,047 --> 00:23:45,465
go directly to Pohang,

371
00:23:45,549 --> 00:23:48,301
and hand the stuff to one of our men.

372
00:23:48,385 --> 00:23:51,638
Half of the money we make
from this goes to our company,

373
00:23:51,721 --> 00:23:53,473
and we share the rest.

374
00:23:54,057 --> 00:23:56,893
Back then, Boss took 40%
while Jungbae and I took 30.

375
00:23:56,977 --> 00:23:58,562
But now there are four of us...

376
00:23:59,896 --> 00:24:01,064
How should we split it?

377
00:24:01,815 --> 00:24:03,358
You and I will take 30%.

378
00:24:03,442 --> 00:24:05,610
And the other two will take 20%.

379
00:24:07,070 --> 00:24:08,280
You heard him.

380
00:24:09,281 --> 00:24:12,242
Wait. That means you're taking 10% less.

381
00:24:13,785 --> 00:24:16,163
Seungho contributes the most,
so he deserves it.

382
00:24:17,247 --> 00:24:18,415

00:24:24,463 --> 00:24:27,007
So who's our man in Pohang?

A guy we know. He captains a cargo ship
that goes between Korea and Japan.

They said soon,

388
00:24:35,515 --> 00:24:36,933
and they'll let me know.

Yes, sir.

392
00:24:46,568 --> 00:24:48,945
What about him? Is he after us again?

393
00:24:51,281 --> 00:24:52,866
We might need to get rid of him.

394
00:24:53,492 --> 00:24:55,076

395
00:24:57,996 --> 00:24:59,164

about someone else, not me.

I didn't say anything,
so what can they do about it?

00:34:30,735 --> 00:34:32,278
So I guess I'll trust you.

543
00:34:33,279 --> 00:34:34,655
I'll get going, then.

544
00:34:36,199 --> 00:34:37,200

546
00:34:56,052 --> 00:34:57,303
-Mingoo.
-MINGOO: Hey, Dodgers.

547
00:34:57,386 --> 00:34:59,180
-But you promised...
-We have a guest.

548
00:35:01,599 --> 00:35:02,683
Wendy.

549
00:35:03,101 --> 00:35:05,770
Mingoo, this is Yankees' girlfriend.

550
00:35:05,853 --> 00:35:07,480
Look at this fucking idiot.

551
00:35:07,563 --> 00:35:09,315
Long time no see, Dodgers.

552
00:35:10,817 --> 00:35:13,027
I heard someone
was sucking the cops' dicks.

553
00:35:13,152 --> 00:35:14,862
-(LAUGHS)
-So it was you.

554
00:35:14,946 --> 00:35:17,240
With all of you here, it's a total mess.

555
00:35:17,323 --> 00:35:20,284
Fuck, is this a junkie reunion or what?

556
00:35:21,828 --> 00:35:24,831
Hey, Wendy. (LAUGHS)

557
00:35:26,541 --> 00:35:29,293
Why the hell do you all
have names like that?

558
00:35:29,794 --> 00:35:34,423
I heard you were looking
for that motherfucker Yankees.

559
00:35:34,507 --> 00:35:36,050
That's right.

560
00:35:36,134 --> 00:35:38,886
If you heard I was looking for Yankees,

561
00:35:39,720 --> 00:35:42,932
you must know what information I need.

562
00:35:43,015 --> 00:35:45,309
I know. That's why I'm here.

563
00:35:45,393 --> 00:35:46,644
Okay, Wendy.

564
00:35:47,728 --> 00:35:50,064
What's the thing you think I want to know?

565
00:35:50,148 --> 00:35:52,733
You want to know who killed Manager Cho.

566
00:35:53,067 --> 00:35:54,152
Oh!

567
00:35:55,236 --> 00:35:58,197
You're good.

00:36:00,449 --> 00:36:01,534
But you see,

569
00:36:03,578 --> 00:36:05,621
what I have right now is so juicy

570
00:36:05,705 --> 00:36:08,124
that it's luring so many fucking flies.

571
00:36:09,500 --> 00:36:11,419
So why should I believe

572
00:36:11,502 --> 00:36:13,254
your fucking lie

573
00:36:13,713 --> 00:36:16,257

at such a convenient moment?

574

00:36:32,481 --> 00:36:34,650

civilian government came in,

578
00:36:34,734 --> 00:36:37,612

have no respect for the police.

579
00:36:37,695 --> 00:36:39,071

580
00:36:40,156 --> 00:36:41,490
beat some sense into you? Huh?

581
00:36:45,620 --> 00:36:46,621
What's this?

582
00:36:47,413 --> 00:36:48,623
This jacket.

583
00:36:49,040 --> 00:36:51,918
It's what Yankees was wearing
on the day Manager Cho died.

584
00:36:53,211 --> 00:36:54,670
You see the blood stain here?

585
00:36:56,881 --> 00:37:00,968
He got this when Manager Cho
beat him to a damn pulp.

586
00:37:01,510 --> 00:37:04,096
And since he was beaten to a damn pulp,

587
00:37:04,889 --> 00:37:07,683
Gangnam Union offed Cho
because they back Yankees.

588
00:37:07,767 --> 00:37:08,768
I know.

589
00:37:08,851 --> 00:37:11,229
I know that, too.

590
00:37:11,312 --> 00:37:12,980
But there's no evidence.

591
00:37:13,773 --> 00:37:16,150
Either bring me evidence or Yankees.

592
00:37:16,234 --> 00:37:17,735
Not this fucking bullshit.

How do you know him?

595
00:37:29,705 --> 00:37:33,042
Yankees said Seo Jongryeol
killed Manager Cho.

596
00:37:34,168 --> 00:37:36,170
And he's committed murder before.

597
00:37:36,254 --> 00:37:37,838
What the fuck?

598
00:37:38,464 --> 00:37:41,175

-Stay away from me.

601

Including that idiot,

602
00:37:56,315 --> 00:37:59,110
everyone is looking
for that asshole Yankees now.

603
00:37:59,193 --> 00:38:02,029
But they can't find him,
so now they're all coming to me.

604
00:38:03,447 --> 00:38:05,700
I heard you were looking for me, too.

605

Stop that, you fucking bitch.

606
00:38:08,577 --> 00:38:11,539
What if those thugs
are looking for me, too?

607
00:38:11,622 --> 00:38:14,250
I don't want to end up like Manager Cho.

608
00:38:15,584 --> 00:38:17,044
And I'm sick of this life too.

609
00:38:23,509 --> 00:38:25,553
-What's this?
-That's ice.

610
00:38:26,846 --> 00:38:30,266

left only these small potatoes.

You had this all planned out, didn't you?

624
00:39:02,256 --> 00:39:05,343
I think they call it
a reward for a crime tip

625

or whatever.

626
00:39:09,430 --> 00:39:11,098
And as you can see, I'm pregnant.

to make trouble again?

00:44:16,820 --> 00:44:17,863
Hello.

721
00:44:17,946 --> 00:44:19,740
Oh, hello.

722
00:44:19,823 --> 00:44:21,784
I'm from SMPA.

723
00:44:23,369 --> 00:44:26,705
I heard you caught
Manager Cho's murder suspect.

724
00:44:26,789 --> 00:44:28,916
We were interested in that case, too.

725
00:44:29,792 --> 00:44:31,585
So I came to check how it's going.

726
00:44:32,294 --> 00:44:37,383
So you didn't kill Manager Cho, right?

728
00:44:46,850 --> 00:44:47,851
Hey, blind man.

729
00:44:49,311 --> 00:44:51,063
Stop that if you don't want to die.

730
00:44:57,319 --> 00:44:59,488
All right. (TYPING)

731
00:45:00,614 --> 00:45:01,907
Let's start over.

732
00:45:03,325 --> 00:45:06,537
You know Manager Cho, right?
(TYPING)

733
00:45:09,164 --> 00:45:10,374

734
00:45:10,457 --> 00:45:11,750
to remain

735
00:45:11,834 --> 00:45:14,044
-silent.
-You fucking bastard!

736
00:45:14,128 --> 00:45:16,588
-You motherfucker!
-Stop!

737
00:45:16,672 --> 00:45:18,966
-Put that down.
-Let go.

738
00:45:19,049 --> 00:45:20,050
Move.

739
00:45:20,592 --> 00:45:23,011
All right. Let's see how far we can go.

740
00:45:23,262 --> 00:45:24,263
What's your name?

741
00:45:24,346 --> 00:45:27,099
No. What's your father's name? Huh?

742
00:45:29,727 --> 00:45:32,563
The right to remain silent.

743
00:45:32,646 --> 00:45:33,647
Motherfucker!

744
00:45:33,731 --> 00:45:36,233
-Stop.
-You goddamn motherfucker!

745
00:45:36,316 --> 00:45:37,359
Is that his name?

746
00:45:37,443 --> 00:45:40,487
You fucking son of a bitch!

747
00:45:40,571 --> 00:45:43,031
The right to remain silent? Motherfucker!

748
00:45:44,283 --> 00:45:45,868
Hey, go and...

749
00:45:45,951 --> 00:45:47,619
Where's that fucking bitch?

750
00:45:48,245 --> 00:45:51,331
That Wendy bitch.
Yankees' girlfriend. Bring her here now.

751
00:45:53,083 --> 00:45:55,210
She was sent to the prosecution yesterday.

752
00:45:55,294 --> 00:45:56,920
Then SMPA's Narcotics team took her.

753
00:45:57,296 --> 00:45:58,672
Why SMPA's Narcotics?

754
00:45:58,756 --> 00:46:02,050
Apparently, she got extra charges
for drug manufacturing.

755
00:46:02,134 --> 00:46:03,677
God damn it!

756
00:46:03,761 --> 00:46:07,890
God fucking damn it! Fucking shit!

757
00:46:09,433 --> 00:46:12,311
Nothing ever fucking works out!

758
00:46:12,394 --> 00:46:14,980
-How did it go?
-He's not saying anything,

759
00:46:15,063 --> 00:46:17,024
and he's maintaining
his right to stay silent.

760
00:46:19,026 --> 00:46:20,402
Keep watching him.

761
00:46:20,486 --> 00:46:22,237
Yes, sir. I'll keep you updated.

762
00:46:58,857 --> 00:47:00,400
We decided the delivery date.

763
00:47:02,277 --> 00:47:04,238
-When is it?
-In two days.

764
00:47:09,535 --> 00:47:10,828
Is there a chance

765
00:47:12,788 --> 00:47:16,250
that we can increase the imports?

766
00:47:17,209 --> 00:47:19,586
It takes one whole week
to make the product.

767
00:47:21,296 --> 00:47:24,550
What? Did something happen to Mr. Jung?

768
00:47:25,717 --> 00:47:27,553
No, nothing special.

769
00:47:30,430 --> 00:47:32,099
Well, it's just...

770
00:47:32,766 --> 00:47:35,686
some detective's been pestering
the boss lately.

771
00:47:36,728 --> 00:47:40,315
And he seems to think
that could stop our trade.

772
00:47:40,440 --> 00:47:42,818
(CLICKS TONGUE)
He's very sensitive these days.

773
00:47:43,151 --> 00:47:44,152
Doesn't that mean

774
00:47:45,195 --> 00:47:47,197
something like that
could happen to me, too?

775
00:47:49,533 --> 00:47:50,909
Haeryun.

776
00:47:52,786 --> 00:47:54,663
Don't worry. Eh?

777
00:47:55,497 --> 00:47:56,748
I'm here.

778
00:47:57,457 --> 00:47:59,751
If by any chance things don't seem right,

779
00:47:59,835 --> 00:48:01,545
I'll tell you immediately.

780
00:48:02,170 --> 00:48:04,923
Then, you can go to China
for a bit and take a break.

781
00:48:05,424 --> 00:48:06,800
But for now,

782
00:48:07,843 --> 00:48:08,927
you can just relax

783
00:48:10,012 --> 00:48:11,430
and enjoy your time in Korea.

784
00:48:14,057 --> 00:48:15,559

785
00:48:17,728 --> 00:48:19,187

My father

790
00:48:38,957 --> 00:48:43,045
had bought extra in case he needed more
from the chemical suppliers.

791
00:48:45,797 --> 00:48:47,424
I'll give you all that.

792
00:48:47,507 --> 00:48:51,094
I'll make sure to bring over
the stuff safely.

793
00:48:52,346 --> 00:48:53,555
I promise.

It's Father's order.

801

(IN MANDARIN) Yes, ma'am!

(IN KOREAN) What a piece of shit.

804
00:49:51,947 --> 00:49:53,407
Some will go to Jinpo Port

805
00:49:53,490 --> 00:49:55,033
and the rest will go to Pohang.

All right, everyone.

for today and tomorrow.

that will go down in history.
