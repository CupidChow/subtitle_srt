00:00:01,710 --> 00:00:08,675
THE CHARACTERS, PLACES, ORGANIZATIONS AND
EVENTS IN THIS DRAMA ARE WORKS OF FICTION

2
00:00:13,013 --> 00:00:14,347
Who are you?

3
00:00:24,983 --> 00:00:27,235
Why the hell do you have this watch?

4
00:00:27,318 --> 00:00:30,739
I heard Taeho died
while hanging out with you guys.

5
00:00:44,669 --> 00:00:46,880
Taeho never told me he had a cousin.

6
00:00:48,089 --> 00:00:52,343
So did you find who killed Taeho or not?

7
00:00:52,427 --> 00:00:54,012
Is that why you're here?

8
00:00:55,055 --> 00:00:56,389
We're looking for him now.

9
00:00:56,473 --> 00:01:00,643
You've got to be fucking kidding me.

10
00:01:00,727 --> 00:01:01,853
What did you just say?

11
00:01:01,936 --> 00:01:03,646
-Hey.
-Fucking hell.

12
00:01:03,730 --> 00:01:04,731
Don't.

13
00:01:14,365 --> 00:01:18,745
Why the hell are you suddenly
looking for Taeho after all this time?

14
00:01:18,828 --> 00:01:20,288
That's none of your business.

15
00:01:21,623 --> 00:01:25,919
What the hell have you been doing?

16
00:01:26,002 --> 00:01:27,879
Your friend's fucking dead.

17
00:01:28,713 --> 00:01:32,217
Just watching you morons drives me nuts.

18
00:01:32,300 --> 00:01:34,552
You fucking asshole.

19
00:01:34,636 --> 00:01:38,139
So?

20
00:01:38,223 --> 00:01:41,309
Are you really Taeho's friends?

21
00:01:41,392 --> 00:01:42,644
Are you?

22
00:01:48,233 --> 00:01:50,777
Well, what should I expect
from you scumbags?

23
00:01:51,277 --> 00:01:52,278
Right?

24
00:01:57,951 --> 00:01:59,202
Where are you going?

25
00:01:59,869 --> 00:02:02,330
To find the bastard
who killed Taeho, obviously.

26
00:02:02,914 --> 00:02:03,915
And then?

27
00:02:03,998 --> 00:02:05,416
I'll rip him into pieces.

28
00:02:13,883 --> 00:02:16,136
Come by my office sometime.

29
00:02:16,219 --> 00:02:17,387
Let's talk about Taeho.

30
00:02:24,561 --> 00:02:26,146
Move!

31
00:02:31,818 --> 00:02:34,070
Are you really going to
let him go like that?

32
00:02:47,125 --> 00:02:48,251
How did it go?

33
00:02:48,918 --> 00:02:50,378
He invited me to his office.

34
00:02:51,671 --> 00:02:53,131
Hey.

35
00:02:53,214 --> 00:02:54,465
Yeah?

36
00:02:54,549 --> 00:02:57,135
My acting's pretty fucking good.

37
00:02:58,011 --> 00:02:59,345
Idiot.

38
00:03:04,434 --> 00:03:08,897
THE WORST OF EVIL

39
00:03:15,570 --> 00:03:18,114
I went to Taeho's columbarium
last week.

40
00:03:18,198 --> 00:03:20,450
The building is new and well-maintained,

41
00:03:21,159 --> 00:03:22,493
so it was comforting.

42
00:03:23,203 --> 00:03:25,455
By the way,

43
00:03:26,623 --> 00:03:29,542
why do you think Taeho
never mentioned his cousin to us?

44
00:03:42,222 --> 00:03:44,432
Why didn't you just keep the watch?

45
00:03:45,475 --> 00:03:47,227
What am I going to do with that?

46
00:03:49,687 --> 00:03:51,898
I don't see any photos of them together.

47
00:03:53,233 --> 00:03:54,234
Seungho.

48
00:03:55,318 --> 00:03:58,363
I haven't heard from him
since he joined the fishing crew,

49
00:03:58,446 --> 00:04:00,949
but he recently came back
and asked me about Taeho.

50
00:04:01,491 --> 00:04:04,244
My brother lived in Wonju.

51
00:04:04,327 --> 00:04:07,038
When Taeho was in elementary school,

52
00:04:07,121 --> 00:04:10,124
he'd stay with Seungho there
every summer vacation.

53
00:04:10,667 --> 00:04:13,711
They were always together, like twins.

54
00:04:13,795 --> 00:04:14,796
So imagine

55
00:04:16,256 --> 00:04:21,469
how shocking it must've been for him
to hear about Taeho.

56
00:04:33,731 --> 00:04:35,984
I haven't used a single cent
of the money you gave me.

57
00:04:36,067 --> 00:04:37,443
Take it and leave.

58
00:04:45,326 --> 00:04:46,869
And...

59
00:04:48,371 --> 00:04:51,124
never come back.

60
00:04:51,791 --> 00:04:53,793
Seeing you reminds me of Taeho

61
00:04:55,128 --> 00:04:59,007
and makes me resent you.

62
00:05:12,520 --> 00:05:16,024
The variable in this plan is
they could talk to Taeho's father

63
00:05:16,107 --> 00:05:18,067
to do a background check on me.

64
00:05:18,526 --> 00:05:19,861
Please be prepared for it.

65
00:05:20,403 --> 00:05:23,031
KARAOKE BAR, MASSAGE

66
00:05:26,701 --> 00:05:27,952
JUNG GICHEUL

67
00:05:43,259 --> 00:05:45,470
Those punks.

68
00:06:04,781 --> 00:06:05,948
Hey.

69
00:06:07,742 --> 00:06:09,786
Don't just stand there. Have a seat.

70
00:06:25,051 --> 00:06:26,844
I've been doing some thinking.

71
00:06:28,971 --> 00:06:32,100
A cousin who had been completely
out of touch suddenly shows up

72
00:06:32,183 --> 00:06:34,394
and causes a ruckus.

73
00:06:34,977 --> 00:06:37,063
What do you think about this situation?

74
00:06:40,983 --> 00:06:42,944
I see your intentions.

75
00:06:46,864 --> 00:06:47,949
Take it.

76
00:06:49,242 --> 00:06:51,869
And stop using his name to scam people.

77
00:06:52,495 --> 00:06:55,706
You may be his family,
but there's a limit to my patience. Okay?

78
00:06:57,291 --> 00:06:58,793
Take that and get lost.

79
00:06:58,876 --> 00:07:01,838
You low lives really are
nothing more than thugs.

80
00:07:01,921 --> 00:07:02,964
What did you say?

81
00:07:04,590 --> 00:07:06,759
Did you think

82
00:07:08,469 --> 00:07:12,765
I'd just happily take
the money and leave, you fuckers?

83
00:07:12,849 --> 00:07:14,517
You son of a bitch.

84
00:07:14,600 --> 00:07:15,852
No, don't.

85
00:07:15,935 --> 00:07:17,645
I've had it. Come here.

86
00:07:17,728 --> 00:07:19,147
-Please just...
-What?

87
00:07:19,439 --> 00:07:21,607
You've had it? Okay, bring it on.

88
00:07:23,484 --> 00:07:25,528
You want to find out
what happens next?

89
00:07:28,489 --> 00:07:30,825
Fuck you, you two-bit thug.

90
00:07:37,790 --> 00:07:39,417
Seriously, this again?

91
00:07:40,293 --> 00:07:41,752
Move, you asshole.

92
00:07:48,009 --> 00:07:49,385
Not all of you, you morons.

93
00:07:49,469 --> 00:07:50,636
We're no small-time thugs.

94
00:07:56,392 --> 00:07:57,435
Yongdae.

95
00:07:57,518 --> 00:07:58,519
Yes, sir.

96
00:08:04,609 --> 00:08:05,985
You fucking...

97
00:08:06,986 --> 00:08:08,154
Motherfucker!

98
00:08:20,416 --> 00:08:21,876
You fuckers!

99
00:08:30,676 --> 00:08:31,844
Asshole!

100
00:08:34,805 --> 00:08:36,349
Fuck.

101
00:08:37,725 --> 00:08:39,018
Clean it up, boys.

102
00:08:40,394 --> 00:08:41,479
Yes, sir.

103
00:08:41,562 --> 00:08:43,564
You fucking proud of that?

104
00:08:50,655 --> 00:08:52,657
Who kicked me just now?

105
00:09:02,875 --> 00:09:03,960
You bastards.

106
00:09:05,920 --> 00:09:06,921
Get down here.

107
00:09:07,004 --> 00:09:08,464
You fucking little...

108
00:09:11,801 --> 00:09:12,885
Motherfuckers.

109
00:09:14,595 --> 00:09:16,681
You piece of shit.

110
00:09:16,764 --> 00:09:20,643
You worthless piece of shit!

111
00:09:24,522 --> 00:09:25,731
Hey!

112
00:09:27,233 --> 00:09:28,734
You fucking bastard.

113
00:09:30,236 --> 00:09:31,362
Fuck!

114
00:09:34,574 --> 00:09:35,741
You fucker...

115
00:09:43,249 --> 00:09:46,419
Get off me, you bastard!

116
00:09:48,504 --> 00:09:50,756
You asshole.

117
00:09:50,840 --> 00:09:52,174
You piece of shit.

118
00:09:52,258 --> 00:09:53,843
You little

119
00:09:54,635 --> 00:09:56,470
piece of...

120
00:09:56,554 --> 00:09:57,638
Enough!

121
00:10:13,821 --> 00:10:15,781
I see you're not here because of money.

122
00:10:17,491 --> 00:10:20,870
You son of a bitch.

123
00:10:23,289 --> 00:10:24,373
Hey.

124
00:10:25,916 --> 00:10:27,668
Listen, you fucker.

125
00:10:27,752 --> 00:10:29,420
Do you know what my uncle said

126
00:10:30,463 --> 00:10:33,257
when he put Taeho's watch on my wrist?

127
00:10:34,592 --> 00:10:37,678
He said as long as this
is on my wrist, I'm with Taeho,

128
00:10:37,762 --> 00:10:40,014
so forget about revenge.

129
00:10:41,515 --> 00:10:42,683
But you know what?

130
00:10:44,685 --> 00:10:47,480
Since Taeho thought you pricks
were his friends,

131
00:10:47,563 --> 00:10:49,899
I feel so fucking bad for him.

132
00:10:53,444 --> 00:10:54,570
I'm...

133
00:10:56,030 --> 00:10:59,075
going to do whatever it takes
to get revenge for Taeho.

134
00:10:59,408 --> 00:11:00,409
Okay?

135
00:11:01,619 --> 00:11:03,788
You damn two-bit thugs.

136
00:11:05,247 --> 00:11:09,377
Just clean this place up
and stay fucking put.

137
00:11:10,878 --> 00:11:12,129
Because I'll bring you

138
00:11:12,213 --> 00:11:15,049
the head of the bastard who killed Taeho.

139
00:11:26,310 --> 00:11:28,312
You disloyal assholes.

140
00:11:48,332 --> 00:11:50,000
Was his name Kwon Seungho?

141
00:11:50,084 --> 00:11:51,377
Yes. Why?

142
00:11:52,628 --> 00:11:54,088
Should we ask him to join us?

143
00:11:55,047 --> 00:11:57,007
We can think of him as Taeho.

144
00:11:58,050 --> 00:11:59,885
What are you saying?

145
00:12:00,720 --> 00:12:02,304
You saw how good he was.

146
00:12:03,139 --> 00:12:05,015
Wouldn't it be nice to have

147
00:12:05,099 --> 00:12:07,601
someone other than Chief Seo
who's a good fighter?

148
00:12:07,685 --> 00:12:08,728
How can we trust him?

149
00:12:08,811 --> 00:12:11,856
He said he's Taeho's cousin.

150
00:12:11,939 --> 00:12:13,441
Heesung.

151
00:12:13,566 --> 00:12:17,027
Since when did you trust people so easily?

152
00:12:17,486 --> 00:12:18,654
Come on.

153
00:12:19,196 --> 00:12:20,531
What the fuck did you say?

154
00:12:23,284 --> 00:12:24,493
You know what I mean.

155
00:12:25,119 --> 00:12:27,413
What we're doing isn't ordinary.

156
00:12:27,496 --> 00:12:28,956
So let's be careful, okay?

157
00:12:29,039 --> 00:12:30,624
And stop being so thoughtless.

158
00:12:31,167 --> 00:12:32,543
You disrespectful bastard.

159
00:12:34,462 --> 00:12:35,671
Hey.

160
00:12:36,005 --> 00:12:38,632
You're finding faults
in everything I say lately.

161
00:12:38,716 --> 00:12:41,260
Well, what else is there to find?
God damn it.

162
00:12:41,343 --> 00:12:42,470
"God damn it"?

163
00:12:42,553 --> 00:12:44,430
"God damn it"?

164
00:12:44,555 --> 00:12:45,765
Hey.

165
00:12:47,308 --> 00:12:48,893
Hurry and go to work.

166
00:12:52,813 --> 00:12:54,648
Fine. Do whatever the fuck you want.

167
00:13:20,633 --> 00:13:23,219
Hello, sir. Have you seen
this person before?

168
00:13:25,012 --> 00:13:26,388
- Hello, sir.
- Hello.

169
00:13:26,472 --> 00:13:27,473
Have you seen...

170
00:13:27,556 --> 00:13:31,227
Wasn't it awesome yesterday?
It was so fucking good.

171
00:13:31,310 --> 00:13:32,311
Yesterday...

172
00:13:32,394 --> 00:13:33,521
What?

173
00:13:35,940 --> 00:13:37,191
Isn't that Kwon Seungho?

174
00:13:37,733 --> 00:13:39,443
-That punk...
-Hey!

175
00:13:40,027 --> 00:13:42,613
-What? Let go of me.
-Come on!

176
00:13:43,030 --> 00:13:44,365
Follow me.

177
00:13:46,325 --> 00:13:48,244
- Hello.
- Hello.

178
00:13:48,744 --> 00:13:50,287
What was he asking about?

179
00:13:50,371 --> 00:13:54,333
It was something about this flyer.

180
00:13:54,416 --> 00:13:56,252
MURDER SUSPECT

181
00:13:56,669 --> 00:13:59,088
-If you see him, call the police.
-Some soup please.

182
00:13:59,171 --> 00:14:00,339
-Thank you.
-Come on.

183
00:14:00,422 --> 00:14:01,715
Bye.

184
00:14:01,799 --> 00:14:02,842
Hello, sir.

185
00:14:02,925 --> 00:14:04,426
Have you seen this person?

186
00:14:04,510 --> 00:14:06,971
If you see him,
please report him to the police.

187
00:14:07,054 --> 00:14:08,889
That bastard...

188
00:14:10,432 --> 00:14:12,685
Please report him to the police.
Thank you.

189
00:14:19,650 --> 00:14:23,279
BUSAN, SOUTH KOREA

190
00:14:50,180 --> 00:14:51,348
-Give it.
-Yes, boss.

191
00:15:00,149 --> 00:15:01,275
Well done.

192
00:15:02,484 --> 00:15:03,485
For lunch.

193
00:15:04,236 --> 00:15:05,237
Thank you, boss.

194
00:15:09,158 --> 00:15:10,242
Go.

195
00:15:31,639 --> 00:15:32,681
Long time no see.

196
00:15:32,765 --> 00:15:34,099
You bastard!

197
00:15:35,976 --> 00:15:37,227
You damn motherfucker!

198
00:15:37,311 --> 00:15:38,771
All right, hold on.

199
00:15:39,688 --> 00:15:41,815
Calm down and hear me out.

200
00:15:43,317 --> 00:15:45,235
I came here without telling Gicheul

201
00:15:45,319 --> 00:15:47,029
to talk about something important.

202
00:15:50,074 --> 00:15:52,201
You and I clicked so well,

203
00:15:52,284 --> 00:15:54,286
so I've always wished we were friends.

204
00:15:55,371 --> 00:15:57,498
But there was a hierarchy back then.

205
00:15:58,791 --> 00:16:00,084
Hey.

206
00:16:00,709 --> 00:16:04,964
Stop beating around the bush
and get to the point.

207
00:16:05,047 --> 00:16:08,467
I'll listen and see if I'll stick
my knife into your stomach or not.

208
00:16:08,550 --> 00:16:10,552
Have you heard the rumor

209
00:16:10,636 --> 00:16:13,263
that Gicheul is raking in
a fortune these days?

210
00:16:13,347 --> 00:16:17,810
Don't ask me questions
and say what you have to say.

211
00:16:17,893 --> 00:16:20,396
Every month,
he sends the boss tens of millions.

212
00:16:20,479 --> 00:16:22,189
So imagine how much he actually earns.

213
00:16:22,815 --> 00:16:24,858
And guess how money has changed him.

214
00:16:25,484 --> 00:16:26,986
He looks down on others now.

215
00:16:27,069 --> 00:16:28,821
He thinks everyone's beneath him.

216
00:16:28,904 --> 00:16:32,199
We've been friends for 10 years
and he treats me like a slave.

217
00:16:32,282 --> 00:16:34,493
You pathetic pieces of shit.

218
00:16:35,536 --> 00:16:37,705
It's so fucking embarrassing.

219
00:16:39,123 --> 00:16:40,124
Hando.

220
00:16:41,083 --> 00:16:43,085
Let's join forces and take Gicheul down.

221
00:16:45,295 --> 00:16:48,215
For you, it's a chance to get back

222
00:16:48,298 --> 00:16:50,217
what was once yours in style.

223
00:16:50,300 --> 00:16:52,928
Let's cut him down
to put him out of commission

224
00:16:53,012 --> 00:16:55,514
and take over his businesses.

225
00:16:55,597 --> 00:16:57,808
I know how it runs inside and out.

226
00:16:58,434 --> 00:17:00,352
You piece of shit.

227
00:17:00,436 --> 00:17:03,480
You came all the way here
to stab your friend in the back?

228
00:17:09,778 --> 00:17:13,741
We didn't have a wedding,
but my girlfriend's eight months pregnant.

229
00:17:14,366 --> 00:17:18,162
I'm going to be the breadwinner,
so shouldn't I dream big?

230
00:17:19,580 --> 00:17:22,666
You can ask the boss
for permission in advance

231
00:17:22,750 --> 00:17:24,710
and assemble the old Busan gang again.

232
00:17:24,793 --> 00:17:27,504
Then, I'll have things ready in Gangnam.

233
00:17:28,297 --> 00:17:29,673
It can't be that hard.

234
00:17:42,019 --> 00:17:45,272
<i>To record a voicemail,</i>
<i>please press two.</i>

235
00:17:45,939 --> 00:17:48,067
<i>Please record your message.</i>

236
00:17:48,150 --> 00:17:50,569
Euijeong, I'm in Daegu now.

237
00:17:51,904 --> 00:17:54,656
One of the murder suspects fled this way.

238
00:17:55,240 --> 00:17:58,327
I'll have to stay here
and stake him out until we catch him.

239
00:17:59,453 --> 00:18:01,080
Don't worry too much.

240
00:18:03,415 --> 00:18:05,209
I'll leave you another message.

241
00:18:14,510 --> 00:18:15,719
What took you so long?

242
00:18:16,678 --> 00:18:18,305
I got stuck in traffic.

243
00:18:23,435 --> 00:18:24,853
Pour me a drink.

244
00:18:36,448 --> 00:18:39,118
Please give us your consent.
We promise we won't fail.

245
00:18:39,201 --> 00:18:41,411
We are direct subordinates
from the family,

246
00:18:41,495 --> 00:18:43,622
and they're just dancing monkeys
from Gangnam.

247
00:18:45,082 --> 00:18:47,167
So why were you crushed by those monkeys?

248
00:18:47,751 --> 00:18:51,505
Was it because you're stupid?

249
00:18:51,588 --> 00:18:55,634
Or was it because
you were especially stupid on that day?

250
00:18:59,388 --> 00:19:02,516
It is true you are direct subordinates,

251
00:19:03,058 --> 00:19:05,936
but Gicheul sends me money
every month without fail.

252
00:19:06,395 --> 00:19:07,938
And my sworn brother in Japan

253
00:19:08,730 --> 00:19:11,066
adores him too,
saying no one should touch him.

254
00:19:13,819 --> 00:19:15,237
And to be honest,

255
00:19:16,488 --> 00:19:18,365
if you take over that area,

256
00:19:19,658 --> 00:19:21,827
it won't make much difference to me.

257
00:19:22,828 --> 00:19:24,621
You know Hong Heesung, right?

258
00:19:24,705 --> 00:19:27,624
He's with us now.
We're sure we can do it this time.

259
00:19:28,709 --> 00:19:30,335
If you let us take over Gangnam,

260
00:19:31,170 --> 00:19:33,255
we'll give you twice as much every month.

261
00:19:37,467 --> 00:19:38,468
Jung Gicheul.

262
00:19:38,552 --> 00:19:40,846
JUNG GICHEUL

263
00:19:43,056 --> 00:19:45,350
Jung Gicheul.

264
00:19:55,986 --> 00:19:57,821
<i>This is Jung Gicheul. Let's meet.</i>

265
00:20:13,420 --> 00:20:15,380
Wasn't there a rock club here before?

266
00:20:15,797 --> 00:20:19,301
It closed and was empty,
so we took it over.

267
00:20:20,510 --> 00:20:22,930
Gicheul said the area
needs more youth to thrive,

268
00:20:23,013 --> 00:20:24,473
so he's opening a new one.

269
00:20:24,556 --> 00:20:27,726
That stupid DJ really loves
dancing and partying.

270
00:20:30,187 --> 00:20:32,231
On days we sign contracts,

271
00:20:32,314 --> 00:20:35,275
it's tradition for all of us to gather
and celebrate.

272
00:20:36,276 --> 00:20:37,736
And that party is tonight.

273
00:20:38,445 --> 00:20:40,030
Is everything ready?

274
00:20:41,031 --> 00:20:42,658
Of course.

275
00:20:42,741 --> 00:20:44,451
It'll be a perfect crime.

276
00:20:45,285 --> 00:20:48,622
The boys are hiding
in three separate motels,

277
00:20:49,248 --> 00:20:52,417
and when it's time later on,

278
00:20:52,501 --> 00:20:55,379
they'll all swarm in together.

279
00:20:57,214 --> 00:20:58,632
And to keep them hidden,

280
00:20:58,715 --> 00:21:00,175
only one will have weapons, right?

281
00:21:00,717 --> 00:21:01,843
Of course.

282
00:21:04,054 --> 00:21:05,847
Should I take them in advance

283
00:21:05,931 --> 00:21:07,683
and hide them inside?

284
00:21:10,978 --> 00:21:12,104
If you want to.

285
00:21:13,188 --> 00:21:14,481
Listen.

286
00:21:14,564 --> 00:21:17,401
There will be a small bar near the stage.

287
00:21:17,484 --> 00:21:19,027
I'll put them under it.

288
00:21:20,445 --> 00:21:21,446
All right.

289
00:21:23,240 --> 00:21:24,366
One more thing.

290
00:21:25,117 --> 00:21:26,118
What?

291
00:21:28,453 --> 00:21:31,123
They're all my friends and brothers.

292
00:21:32,082 --> 00:21:33,250
So please

293
00:21:34,209 --> 00:21:36,044
don't hurt them too much

294
00:21:36,128 --> 00:21:37,963
and make sure nothing bad happens.

295
00:21:38,380 --> 00:21:40,382
What the hell?

296
00:21:41,466 --> 00:21:42,968
That'll depend on you.

297
00:21:43,051 --> 00:21:46,388
I'm not sure if we could guarantee that.

298
00:21:46,471 --> 00:21:47,597
Let's go.

299
00:21:47,681 --> 00:21:48,849
Yes, sir.

300
00:22:37,105 --> 00:22:38,190
What the...

301
00:23:00,879 --> 00:23:03,340
Hando, please.

302
00:23:06,468 --> 00:23:08,053
You found the place all right.

303
00:23:10,514 --> 00:23:11,848
What is this place?

304
00:23:12,307 --> 00:23:13,642
What are you trying to pull?

305
00:23:13,725 --> 00:23:15,560
We're having a party here tonight.

306
00:23:16,895 --> 00:23:18,105
A party for Taeho.

307
00:23:19,314 --> 00:23:22,776
I don't have time for your crazy bullshit.

308
00:23:22,859 --> 00:23:23,860
A party?

309
00:23:27,948 --> 00:23:31,785
I hear you're looking
for the guy who killed Taeho.

310
00:23:33,745 --> 00:23:34,996
Give that up,

311
00:23:35,914 --> 00:23:37,541
and join my gang.

312
00:23:38,542 --> 00:23:41,378
I'm making this offer
only because you're Taeho's cousin.

313
00:23:58,311 --> 00:23:59,896
You want me to join your gang?

314
00:24:04,609 --> 00:24:05,652
Yeah?

315
00:24:08,029 --> 00:24:09,656
What about revenge for Taeho?

316
00:24:11,783 --> 00:24:12,784
Let's go.

317
00:24:34,347 --> 00:24:36,349
Hey, Gicheul!

318
00:24:39,436 --> 00:24:40,812
Who the hell are they?

319
00:24:41,605 --> 00:24:44,065
Sergeant Jang killed Taeho
and those are his men.

320
00:24:47,360 --> 00:24:49,946
Where's the party?

321
00:24:51,823 --> 00:24:53,116
Heesung, you bastard!

322
00:24:53,909 --> 00:24:55,035
Hando.

323
00:25:09,299 --> 00:25:11,551
Fuck.

324
00:25:13,345 --> 00:25:14,554
Get Gicheul.

325
00:25:15,013 --> 00:25:16,431
Destroy them!

326
00:26:08,149 --> 00:26:09,609
Motherfucker!

327
00:26:13,488 --> 00:26:14,489
Piece of shit!

328
00:26:17,450 --> 00:26:20,036
Get that bastard, you morons!

329
00:26:25,292 --> 00:26:26,626
Fuck!

330
00:26:34,134 --> 00:26:35,218
You bastard...

331
00:26:35,302 --> 00:26:36,720
Who the hell is this fucker?

332
00:26:40,640 --> 00:26:43,268
That bastard... Get up, damn it!

333
00:26:43,351 --> 00:26:44,853
Come on.

334
00:27:01,620 --> 00:27:02,912
Good evening.

335
00:27:10,211 --> 00:27:12,380
Fucking hell.

336
00:27:13,632 --> 00:27:14,966
Kill them all!

337
00:27:15,425 --> 00:27:16,593
Kill them!

338
00:28:09,354 --> 00:28:10,438
Little piece of shit!

339
00:28:10,522 --> 00:28:11,981
You motherfucker.

340
00:28:14,484 --> 00:28:18,238
You fucking piece of shit!

341
00:28:18,321 --> 00:28:19,698
-I'll fucking...
-Hey.

342
00:28:54,149 --> 00:28:55,275
You choose.

343
00:28:56,901 --> 00:28:58,153
Do you want to die here?

344
00:29:12,667 --> 00:29:14,335
Or stay out of my sight forever?

345
00:29:26,848 --> 00:29:28,057
Wrap it up.

346
00:29:30,685 --> 00:29:32,103
I'm tired. Let's wrap it up.

347
00:29:33,480 --> 00:29:36,065
Let go of me!

348
00:29:36,149 --> 00:29:37,901
Get off me, you bastards!

349
00:29:37,984 --> 00:29:39,986
Get off me!

350
00:29:40,069 --> 00:29:42,197
I said get off me, you fucking bastards!

351
00:29:42,280 --> 00:29:43,281
Get off me!

352
00:29:43,364 --> 00:29:44,741
Hando!

353
00:29:44,824 --> 00:29:47,243
- Get off me!
- You bastard!

354
00:29:58,713 --> 00:29:59,714
Hando!

355
00:30:20,735 --> 00:30:21,778
Bye.

356
00:30:24,989 --> 00:30:26,032
You fucker.

357
00:30:26,115 --> 00:30:27,450
Hey, friend.

358
00:30:28,785 --> 00:30:30,912
Fuck off, you bastard.

359
00:30:33,623 --> 00:30:35,208
Did you get hit a lot?

360
00:30:35,291 --> 00:30:37,335
Gangnam is our home, you know.

361
00:30:38,169 --> 00:30:39,629
So stay out.

362
00:30:40,964 --> 00:30:42,215
Sorry, man.

363
00:30:42,799 --> 00:30:44,425
You bastard.

364
00:30:44,509 --> 00:30:46,427
-We have to go, Hando.
-You bastard!

365
00:30:46,511 --> 00:30:49,806
Stay out of our turf, you country fucks!

366
00:30:51,850 --> 00:30:54,310
Hey, wipe that blood off.
It's already drying up.

367
00:30:54,394 --> 00:30:55,395
-Jaehoon.
-Well done.

368
00:30:55,478 --> 00:30:56,479
Use the mop.

369
00:30:56,563 --> 00:30:57,647
Good job.

370
00:30:57,730 --> 00:30:58,940
-Let's work.
-Yes, sir.

371
00:31:00,316 --> 00:31:02,026
You were right.

372
00:31:02,110 --> 00:31:03,903
They all took the bait.

373
00:31:05,488 --> 00:31:06,489
Thanks.

374
00:31:06,573 --> 00:31:10,410
- Hando...
- Out of fucking curiosity,

375
00:31:10,827 --> 00:31:13,621
why did you call me here?

376
00:31:14,289 --> 00:31:15,748
To make me do some fighting?

377
00:31:17,125 --> 00:31:19,002
Why don't you talk to him directly?

378
00:31:20,879 --> 00:31:22,171
Yes, boss.

379
00:31:23,214 --> 00:31:24,632
This is Jung Gicheul.

380
00:31:24,757 --> 00:31:27,677
How fucking annoying.

381
00:31:28,720 --> 00:31:31,097
I heard you allowed Sergeant Jang's boys

382
00:31:31,180 --> 00:31:32,348
to blindside me.

383
00:31:33,725 --> 00:31:38,605
After all the money
I've sent you,

384
00:31:39,397 --> 00:31:41,482
this is just wrong, isn't it?

385
00:31:42,775 --> 00:31:44,652
<i>I won't send any more money now.</i>

386
00:31:47,113 --> 00:31:48,698
Take care.

387
00:32:01,044 --> 00:32:04,923
Find Jung Gicheul in Seoul,

388
00:32:06,591 --> 00:32:10,803
cut his stomach open,
and throw him into the waters of Incheon.

389
00:32:11,512 --> 00:32:13,056
No, wait.

390
00:32:13,806 --> 00:32:19,479
Bring him here, cut his stomach open,
and throw him into the waters of Busan.

391
00:32:25,360 --> 00:32:26,694
In any case,

392
00:32:27,737 --> 00:32:29,739
shouldn't you make a call

393
00:32:29,822 --> 00:32:31,282
to Boss Kanemoto?

394
00:32:38,790 --> 00:32:42,043
You must have done some good acting.

395
00:32:42,126 --> 00:32:44,253
Busan bastards... Hey.

396
00:32:49,926 --> 00:32:54,180
I wanted to get rid
of the useless leeches in the gang,

397
00:32:54,263 --> 00:32:55,264
so I put on a ruse.

398
00:32:57,141 --> 00:32:59,018
Here, everything needs a good reason.

399
00:33:01,980 --> 00:33:03,606
So what?

400
00:33:04,524 --> 00:33:07,068
What does it have to do with me?

401
00:33:08,361 --> 00:33:09,737
What about Sergeant Jang?

402
00:33:11,531 --> 00:33:13,533
Sir, everything's finished.

403
00:33:16,285 --> 00:33:17,328
Shall we go outside?

404
00:33:29,841 --> 00:33:30,842
Yes, sir.

405
00:33:30,925 --> 00:33:32,176
Hey, the lights.

406
00:33:39,308 --> 00:33:41,436
Taeho wanted to open a business here.

407
00:33:42,729 --> 00:33:45,982
I should've done this sooner.
But I guess it's too late.

408
00:33:48,192 --> 00:33:49,235
Taeho...

409
00:33:51,446 --> 00:33:53,448
was like a brother to me.

410
00:34:02,248 --> 00:34:05,835
I want you to make his dream come true.

411
00:34:14,886 --> 00:34:15,928
I killed him.

412
00:34:18,848 --> 00:34:21,392
That son of a bitch
Sergeant Jang killed Taeho,

413
00:34:22,351 --> 00:34:23,936
and I tore him into pieces.

414
00:34:30,401 --> 00:34:33,529
I'm Kwon Seungho. Nice to meet you.

415
00:34:58,846 --> 00:35:01,766
If anyone had a grudge
against him, it's settled now.

416
00:35:02,683 --> 00:35:05,728
He's our newest member,
so treat him well. Got it?

417
00:35:07,313 --> 00:35:08,439
-Yes, sir.
-Yes, sir.

418
00:35:10,191 --> 00:35:11,484
Okay?

419
00:35:11,567 --> 00:35:12,693
Yes, sir!

420
00:35:14,237 --> 00:35:15,988
-Let's give him a hand.
-Hey.

421
00:35:19,325 --> 00:35:20,535
Give him a hand.

422
00:35:52,984 --> 00:35:56,863
So Nonhyeon-dong and Yeoksam-dong.

423
00:35:56,946 --> 00:35:58,197
Only these two are ours.

424
00:35:58,281 --> 00:35:59,657
You can't go beyond.

425
00:35:59,740 --> 00:36:01,450
Each area has its owner.

426
00:36:01,534 --> 00:36:05,246
The job of the newest members
is to patrol our area

427
00:36:05,329 --> 00:36:07,456
from 5:00 p.m. to 5:00 a.m. the next day.

428
00:36:07,540 --> 00:36:10,042
You're like patrol officers.

429
00:36:10,126 --> 00:36:13,880
Check if there's an accident
or if someone's causing a ruckus.

430
00:36:13,963 --> 00:36:17,758
If you spot guys from other gangs, we need
to report it right away. That's it.

431
00:36:18,718 --> 00:36:19,802
Got it?

432
00:36:19,886 --> 00:36:21,470
Left from there.

433
00:36:26,851 --> 00:36:32,690
By the way,
why do you use honorifics with me?

434
00:36:33,399 --> 00:36:36,569
Hey, whoever fights well
deserves my respect.

435
00:36:36,652 --> 00:36:39,530
I mean, I saw you fight,

436
00:36:39,614 --> 00:36:44,619
and even Jackie Chan and Bruce Lee
would be no match for you.

437
00:36:44,702 --> 00:36:47,622
You were amazing.

438
00:36:49,707 --> 00:36:51,876
By the way, to fight well,

439
00:36:52,001 --> 00:36:53,586
should I learn Taekwondo?

440
00:36:54,921 --> 00:36:57,590
-What's your problem?
-Who the fuck are you?

441
00:36:57,673 --> 00:36:59,425
Hey, hit me if you dare.

442
00:36:59,508 --> 00:37:01,886
You motherfucker!

443
00:37:01,969 --> 00:37:03,346
What the fuck's your problem?

444
00:37:16,025 --> 00:37:17,109
Calm down.

445
00:37:18,444 --> 00:37:20,404
You son of a bitch!

446
00:37:27,286 --> 00:37:29,997
-That bastard!
-Go! Just fucking go.

447
00:37:31,958 --> 00:37:33,417
What did you just say?

448
00:37:35,461 --> 00:37:36,879
Have a good one.

449
00:37:41,259 --> 00:37:42,343
Hello, sir.

450
00:37:43,177 --> 00:37:44,553
Yongdae, keep up the good work.

451
00:37:47,390 --> 00:37:49,725
How long are we supposed to do this for?

452
00:37:50,643 --> 00:37:53,145
Once a new guy joins, we'll be free.

453
00:37:54,146 --> 00:37:55,273
When will that happen?

454
00:37:55,356 --> 00:37:58,234
After high school kids graduate?

455
00:37:59,277 --> 00:38:00,528
It's a while away.

456
00:38:02,071 --> 00:38:03,072
Hello, sir!

457
00:38:07,034 --> 00:38:09,161
-Hello, sir!
-Yongdae.

458
00:38:09,245 --> 00:38:10,454
Yes, sir.

459
00:38:10,538 --> 00:38:11,831
Do your job.

460
00:38:11,914 --> 00:38:13,207
Okay?

461
00:38:13,291 --> 00:38:14,500
Good night, sir.

462
00:38:18,504 --> 00:38:20,881
God damn it.

463
00:38:21,632 --> 00:38:24,051
What if all you get out of this

464
00:38:24,135 --> 00:38:25,720
are just driving skills?

465
00:38:25,886 --> 00:38:28,597
Who knows.

466
00:38:30,558 --> 00:38:33,894
I'm going to get some shut-eye.
Wake me up in a bit.

467
00:38:33,978 --> 00:38:37,148
I need to go on fucking patrol again.

468
00:38:39,066 --> 00:38:43,029
<i>Most gangsters take money</i>
<i>for so-called protection.</i>

469
00:38:43,112 --> 00:38:45,698
<i>But each of our members runs a store</i>

470
00:38:45,781 --> 00:38:48,409
<i>and pays half of the profits</i>
<i>to our company.</i>

471
00:38:48,492 --> 00:38:49,577
<i>What an advanced system.</i>

472
00:38:49,702 --> 00:38:52,955
<i>Do you sell anything else</i>
<i>other than food and drinks?</i>

473
00:38:54,165 --> 00:38:55,624
<i>Anything else? Like what?</i>

474
00:38:56,042 --> 00:38:59,879
<i>Well, gambling</i>
<i>or other businesses...</i>

475
00:39:00,671 --> 00:39:04,925
<i>Look. You're the newest guy here</i>
<i>and I'm the second newest.</i>

476
00:39:05,009 --> 00:39:06,427
<i>So what would I know?</i>

477
00:39:06,552 --> 00:39:09,013
<i>All I know is which club</i>
<i>has the hotter girls.</i>

478
00:39:09,096 --> 00:39:10,973
SEOUL METROPOLITAN POLICE AGENCY,
SOUTH KOREA

479
00:39:11,057 --> 00:39:12,933
SECURITY DIVISION

480
00:39:41,670 --> 00:39:42,713
Mr. Cha Bongju.

481
00:39:43,464 --> 00:39:47,593
You'll face three to five years in prison
for violating the National Security Act.

482
00:39:47,676 --> 00:39:49,345
You'll be kicked out of college

483
00:39:49,428 --> 00:39:52,807
and have a criminal record
while your friends find jobs.

484
00:39:52,890 --> 00:39:54,183
I know nothing.

485
00:39:57,061 --> 00:40:00,022
I heard you say earlier
that you're from Jeonju.

486
00:40:02,024 --> 00:40:04,360
Me too. I went to
Jeonju Girls' High School.

487
00:40:06,904 --> 00:40:08,280
Here.

488
00:40:08,364 --> 00:40:09,532
Have one.

489
00:40:10,366 --> 00:40:12,618
It's the least I can do
for a hometown friend.

490
00:40:20,668 --> 00:40:23,003
I usually don't say
things like this, but...

491
00:40:29,093 --> 00:40:31,554
You know we're questioning
your friends as well.

492
00:40:33,180 --> 00:40:37,309
Everyone says you're the leader, Bongju.

493
00:40:38,727 --> 00:40:40,146
But that's not true, right?

494
00:40:47,445 --> 00:40:49,238
Can't you sleep at your own house?

495
00:40:49,321 --> 00:40:53,576
Right. My parents moved to Ilsan, so...

496
00:40:53,659 --> 00:40:55,870
Gosh, I really need to move out.

497
00:40:56,203 --> 00:40:57,580
Then, please go wash up.

498
00:40:57,663 --> 00:40:59,457
I did this morning.

499
00:41:00,416 --> 00:41:02,084
That was yesterday morning.

500
00:41:02,168 --> 00:41:04,837
Who cares? It's still a morning.

501
00:41:05,921 --> 00:41:08,090
Gosh, I'm hungry.

502
00:41:26,442 --> 00:41:27,526
Hello.

503
00:41:28,027 --> 00:41:29,487
<i>Did you page 2473?</i>

504
00:41:30,738 --> 00:41:32,490
Hi, Youngpil.
It's me, Yu Euijeong.

505
00:41:32,573 --> 00:41:33,824
Junmo's...

506
00:41:33,908 --> 00:41:36,660
<i>Hello, Euijeong.</i>

507
00:41:36,744 --> 00:41:37,828
How have you been?

508
00:41:37,912 --> 00:41:39,288
<i>I've been great, thanks.</i>

509
00:41:39,747 --> 00:41:42,500
I haven't heard from Junmo
since yesterday,

510
00:41:42,583 --> 00:41:43,959
so I was just worried.

511
00:41:45,377 --> 00:41:46,670
<i>What?</i>

512
00:41:46,754 --> 00:41:47,922
What is it?

513
00:41:49,381 --> 00:41:52,468
<i>He's on sick leave because of his asthma.</i>

514
00:41:57,973 --> 00:41:58,974
It's hot.

515
00:41:59,058 --> 00:42:01,435
<i>Press one to listen to your voicemail.</i>

516
00:42:02,061 --> 00:42:03,687
<i>It's me. Are you busy?</i>

517
00:42:03,771 --> 00:42:06,732
<i>I know you have asthma,</i>
<i>but we can grab a bite, right?</i>

518
00:42:20,454 --> 00:42:23,165
Hey.

519
00:42:23,916 --> 00:42:27,086
I got an urgent call from a friend.
Can I go grab a quick lunch?

520
00:42:32,299 --> 00:42:33,384
Only if it's a woman.

521
00:42:34,301 --> 00:42:35,302
It's a woman.

522
00:42:35,636 --> 00:42:37,555
Okay. Who is it?

523
00:42:39,098 --> 00:42:40,432
How about a double date?

524
00:42:42,893 --> 00:42:44,478
Handsome guys get it all.

525
00:42:44,562 --> 00:42:45,896
I don't need noodles...

526
00:42:46,855 --> 00:42:50,317
Right. Eating food
with a woman tastes better.

527
00:42:51,235 --> 00:42:53,988
And I'm eating cup noodles alone.
But it's all right.

528
00:43:01,203 --> 00:43:03,455
Euijeong, I'm sorry
I didn't tell you sooner.

529
00:43:16,844 --> 00:43:18,220
Now tell me.

530
00:43:19,388 --> 00:43:20,889
What are you up to these days?

531
00:43:23,058 --> 00:43:25,436
Who's buying you suits
behind your wife's back?

532
00:43:25,519 --> 00:43:26,687
It's not like that.

533
00:43:31,358 --> 00:43:36,739
To tell you the truth,
in order to catch drug traffickers,

534
00:43:36,822 --> 00:43:38,824
I've gone undercover in a gang.

535
00:43:44,288 --> 00:43:46,749
Seriously, that's what they said.

536
00:43:46,832 --> 00:43:48,709
I can't believe...

537
00:43:52,713 --> 00:43:53,714
Hello, sir.

538
00:43:54,798 --> 00:43:55,799
Hey, Seungho.

539
00:43:55,883 --> 00:43:57,426
- Yes, sir?
- What are you doing?

540
00:44:02,556 --> 00:44:04,808
I was just meeting with someone.

541
00:44:05,351 --> 00:44:08,479
Wait, I know her from high school.

542
00:44:09,396 --> 00:44:10,898
Funny to see you all here.

543
00:44:10,981 --> 00:44:12,274
Long time no see.

544
00:44:14,318 --> 00:44:15,319
It's been a while.

545
00:44:16,695 --> 00:44:18,906
She's my friend from elementary school.

546
00:44:18,989 --> 00:44:20,741
We were in the same Taekwondo club.

547
00:44:22,493 --> 00:44:23,702
And this is

548
00:44:24,328 --> 00:44:26,955
the president of the company
I recently joined.

549
00:44:28,791 --> 00:44:30,042
Oh, really?

550
00:44:30,459 --> 00:44:33,671
Gicheul was a grade younger than me
at church back in high school.

551
00:44:36,840 --> 00:44:38,092
How have you been?

552
00:44:38,759 --> 00:44:40,636
Good, thanks.

553
00:44:41,887 --> 00:44:43,097
How is it being a cop?

554
00:44:43,180 --> 00:44:44,807
So you've heard?

555
00:44:46,975 --> 00:44:48,519
What's your department?

556
00:44:49,561 --> 00:44:51,146
Security Division at SMPA.

557
00:44:54,525 --> 00:44:56,110
Are you finished eating?

558
00:44:56,193 --> 00:44:57,194
Yeah.

559
00:44:58,487 --> 00:45:00,114
Can I take Seungho with me?

560
00:45:09,456 --> 00:45:12,793
I'll get going now. I'll call you later.

561
00:45:19,800 --> 00:45:22,219
How dare you meet a cop, you prick?

562
00:45:22,302 --> 00:45:23,429
It's not like that.

563
00:45:23,512 --> 00:45:25,806
We've been close since elementary school.

564
00:45:26,348 --> 00:45:28,308
My dad was a junkie,

565
00:45:28,392 --> 00:45:30,269
and whenever he got high and beat me,

566
00:45:30,352 --> 00:45:33,063
I used to escape to her place.

567
00:45:33,147 --> 00:45:35,691
Why did you contact her, you bastard?

568
00:45:36,191 --> 00:45:37,276
Damn it!

569
00:45:37,359 --> 00:45:39,403
I didn't contact her.

570
00:45:40,696 --> 00:45:42,656
She contacted me first.

571
00:45:44,366 --> 00:45:47,161
Why did that fucking cop contact you?

572
00:45:47,244 --> 00:45:49,121
My dad got in trouble for taking drugs,

573
00:45:51,206 --> 00:45:53,167
and he's being held at SMPA.

574
00:45:57,045 --> 00:45:58,213
Boss.

575
00:46:00,257 --> 00:46:02,009
I seriously couldn't believe it

576
00:46:02,092 --> 00:46:04,261
when I heard you're close with Euijeong.

577
00:46:04,344 --> 00:46:06,430
But is that my fault?

578
00:46:10,392 --> 00:46:11,560
Let's go.

579
00:46:11,685 --> 00:46:13,145
-Seungho.
-Yes, sir.

580
00:46:20,986 --> 00:46:23,322
Show respect to Boss, you son of a bitch.

581
00:46:25,657 --> 00:46:26,825
I'm sorry.

582
00:46:42,925 --> 00:46:44,676
It's me, Euijeong.

583
00:46:44,802 --> 00:46:47,763
You are involved in Junmo's
meth investigation, aren't you?

584
00:46:53,060 --> 00:46:55,813
You think I'll believe
what you say, Seungho?

585
00:46:55,896 --> 00:46:56,897
Hey.

586
00:46:58,232 --> 00:47:00,567
I'm allergic to cops, you know.

587
00:47:00,651 --> 00:47:02,277
Come on. Enough.

588
00:47:10,327 --> 00:47:11,662
Try to understand.

589
00:47:12,621 --> 00:47:14,540
Taeho's cousin suddenly shows up,

590
00:47:14,873 --> 00:47:17,793
and he happened to be the neighbor

591
00:47:17,876 --> 00:47:19,962
of Boss' church friend from high school.

592
00:47:20,587 --> 00:47:22,589
Even to you, doesn't it sound weird?

593
00:47:25,342 --> 00:47:28,762
It's such a small world
in Korea, isn't it?

594
00:47:31,431 --> 00:47:36,562
Gicheul, did she like tteokbokki
from the same shop as you?

595
00:47:40,274 --> 00:47:41,692
I bet she did.

596
00:47:41,775 --> 00:47:44,695
She was his first love,
and they did everything together.

597
00:48:16,560 --> 00:48:18,437
It's from my church
back in high school.

598
00:48:19,021 --> 00:48:20,606
I should take that home.
