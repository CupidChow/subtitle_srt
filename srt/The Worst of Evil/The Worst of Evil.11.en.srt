TWO DAYS AGO

3
00:00:32,657 --> 00:00:33,658
Hey,

4
00:00:33,742 --> 00:00:36,411
can your boss get it up these days?

5
00:00:37,412 --> 00:00:39,497
Yeah, he's feeling better.

6
00:00:39,581 --> 00:00:40,999
For a guy, it'd be humiliating

7
00:00:41,082 --> 00:00:43,168
to become impotent over this, right?

8
00:00:43,251 --> 00:00:44,252
Right.

9
00:00:46,087 --> 00:00:47,088
By the way,

10
00:00:47,630 --> 00:00:50,300
I saw some girl
next to Jung Gicheul the other day.

11
00:00:50,717 --> 00:00:51,968
Do you know who she is?

12
00:00:52,052 --> 00:00:54,262
You know. When your gangs had that brawl,

13
00:00:54,345 --> 00:00:55,972
I heard he had a girl with him.

14
00:00:56,389 --> 00:00:58,808
-Right.
-Who the hell is that bitch?

15
00:00:59,142 --> 00:01:00,477
According to our men,

16
00:01:02,187 --> 00:01:03,480
she's a cop.

17
00:01:03,563 --> 00:01:05,940
-From SMPA or something.
-Ha!

18
00:01:06,858 --> 00:01:08,151
The SMPA?

19
00:01:08,943 --> 00:01:11,154
Bullshit, you motherfuckers.

20
00:01:11,237 --> 00:01:12,530
She really is.

21
00:01:12,822 --> 00:01:14,991
SMPA, my ass.

22
00:01:16,201 --> 00:01:18,995
What did you make me come
all the way here for?

23
00:01:19,079 --> 00:01:20,497
You could've come to me.

24
00:01:20,580 --> 00:01:21,748
Hey.

25
00:01:21,831 --> 00:01:23,041
I'll keep it short.

26
00:01:23,541 --> 00:01:26,920
Could you check if this person is in SMPA?

27
00:01:29,422 --> 00:01:30,423
I know her.

28
00:01:31,049 --> 00:01:32,842
She's the daughter of that guy.

29
00:01:32,926 --> 00:01:33,927
Who?

30
00:01:34,177 --> 00:01:36,679
What was the name
of the former commissioner?

31
00:01:36,763 --> 00:01:37,764
Yu Dukhoon?

32
00:01:37,847 --> 00:01:39,182
She's his daughter.

33
00:01:39,265 --> 00:01:40,642
-Really?
-Yeah.

34
00:01:41,267 --> 00:01:43,186
They're a well-known family of cops.

35
00:01:43,269 --> 00:01:45,271
Commissioner Yu's two sons,

36
00:01:45,355 --> 00:01:48,316
his daughter,
and even his son-in-law are all cops.

37
00:01:48,399 --> 00:01:50,902
Son-in-law? So she's married.

38
00:01:52,153 --> 00:01:53,279
Did she get a divorce?

39
00:01:53,363 --> 00:01:55,406
Divorce in a family of cops? No way.

40
00:01:55,990 --> 00:01:57,242
What the fuck?

41
00:01:58,201 --> 00:02:00,453
Why would a married cop date a thug?

42
00:02:00,537 --> 00:02:01,538
What?

43
00:02:01,621 --> 00:02:03,039
You sure it's her? Look again.

44
00:02:03,123 --> 00:02:04,666
Maybe you're confused. Is it her?

45
00:02:04,749 --> 00:02:05,750
Come on. Look.

46
00:02:08,169 --> 00:02:09,838
EUIJEONG: Are you going to stay here?

47
00:02:13,133 --> 00:02:14,592
This will be our house.

48
00:02:16,469 --> 00:02:18,346
Once this deal is wrapped up,

49
00:02:19,597 --> 00:02:21,266
I'm going to start fresh here.

50
00:02:21,683 --> 00:02:22,851
Will you join me?

51
00:02:24,060 --> 00:02:25,061
Gicheul.

52
00:02:36,823 --> 00:02:38,283
Isn't this place lovely?

53
00:02:38,658 --> 00:02:39,659
Gicheul.

54
00:02:40,160 --> 00:02:42,495
About that deal you just mentioned...

55
00:02:44,831 --> 00:02:45,957
Can't you just quit?

56
00:02:47,250 --> 00:02:48,835
I have to see it through.

57
00:02:48,918 --> 00:02:50,879
Everything will be okay. Don't worry.

59
00:02:57,135 --> 00:03:00,138
Junmo, can't you please stop here?

60
00:03:00,930 --> 00:03:03,224
If you don't let the trade happen...

61
00:03:04,350 --> 00:03:05,894
If you just stop here,

62
00:03:07,187 --> 00:03:09,480
nothing will happen to us.

63
00:03:10,356 --> 00:03:11,524
Who's "us"?

64
00:03:15,778 --> 00:03:17,113
Euijeong, is this...

65
00:03:25,455 --> 00:03:26,664
because of Jung Gicheul?

66
00:03:28,416 --> 00:03:29,667
Junmo.

67
00:03:30,585 --> 00:03:31,711
I...

68
00:03:34,672 --> 00:03:35,673
can't stop here.

77

Let's wrap it up.

78
00:06:18,795 --> 00:06:20,922
MINGOO: Hey, did you find anything?

79
00:06:21,005 --> 00:06:22,465
-MAN: Yes.
-What's his name again?

80
00:06:22,548 --> 00:06:23,633
Officer Park Junmo.

81
00:06:23,716 --> 00:06:26,219
-Park Junmo.
-Yes.

82
00:06:26,302 --> 00:06:28,012
-Senior police officer?
-Yes.

83
00:06:28,096 --> 00:06:29,764
-I'll treat you next time.
-What?

84
00:06:29,847 --> 00:06:30,932
Thanks.

85
00:06:32,475 --> 00:06:33,476
Who's that?

86
00:06:33,559 --> 00:06:34,936

I'll do whatever it takes

91
00:06:47,240 --> 00:06:49,033
to put you behind bars.

92
00:06:59,961 --> 00:07:01,337
I think they got the stuff.

93
00:07:01,421 --> 00:07:03,506
Good. Keep tailing them closely.

We'll get going, sir.

99
00:08:29,383 --> 00:08:33,721
Captain, that black sedan
has been there the whole time.

100
00:08:33,804 --> 00:08:36,307
Don't make any hasty assumptions.

101
00:08:36,390 --> 00:08:39,227
We'll arrest the suspects
after we see them load the boat.

102
00:08:51,322 --> 00:08:52,448
Hey, Yongdae. It's me.

103

Hello, Boss.

104
00:08:55,952 --> 00:08:57,703
Go check on Chief Seo in Gangnam.

00:08:58,412 --> 00:08:59,413
Yes, Boss.

106
00:09:05,461 --> 00:09:08,172
Why do you go to such lengths?
And by yourself?

107
00:09:10,758 --> 00:09:11,926
Because it's dangerous.

108
00:09:13,553 --> 00:09:14,971
That's why I have to do it.

109
00:09:15,721 --> 00:09:17,515
Also, I started it.

110
00:09:19,058 --> 00:09:22,061
I thought this was
the only way I could change

111
00:09:22,144 --> 00:09:24,313
my life and the lives of my men.

112
00:09:25,940 --> 00:09:28,818
But you're keeping this
a secret from them.

113
00:09:29,360 --> 00:09:31,821
If I say their stores were bought
with drug money,

114
00:09:33,364 --> 00:09:35,199
they'll feel guilty about it.

116
00:09:43,207 --> 00:09:44,875
At some point, I started to see

117
00:09:46,919 --> 00:09:48,087
myself in you.

118
00:09:50,339 --> 00:09:52,550
You pursue your goals

119
00:09:53,050 --> 00:09:54,844
persistently and tenaciously.

120
00:09:57,221 --> 00:09:59,348
That's why I'm entrusting you with this.

121
00:10:03,936 --> 00:10:05,229
It won't be easy,

122
00:10:06,522 --> 00:10:08,065
but I wish you good luck.

123
00:10:09,066 --> 00:10:10,234
Okay, sir.

124
00:10:14,947 --> 00:10:16,991
But if it gets too dangerous,

125
00:10:19,076 --> 00:10:20,494
you have to stop there.

126
00:10:39,805 --> 00:10:42,933
By the way,
where does the trade take place?

127
00:10:50,983 --> 00:10:52,276

00:10:54,111 --> 00:10:56,530
Is the dealer Japanese?

130
00:10:56,614 --> 00:10:58,699
No, he's a Korean-Japanese boat captain.

131
00:10:58,783 --> 00:11:02,244
He's fluent in Korean,
so you won't have problems communicating.

00:15:37,853 --> 00:15:40,105
Choi Jungbae and Oh Kyungjin betrayed us.

188
00:15:41,523 --> 00:15:43,275
-HEESUNG: Byungwoo.
-Yes, sir?

189
00:15:43,359 --> 00:15:45,778
What's Kyungjin up to these days?

190
00:15:46,278 --> 00:15:48,906
I don't know, sir.
He's disappeared without a trace since.

191
00:15:48,989 --> 00:15:51,617
Search every damn corner
and find those motherfuckers.

192
00:15:53,118 --> 00:15:55,496
Why the fuck are you just standing there?

193
00:15:56,163 --> 00:15:58,999
Come on. Move your asses!

194
00:15:59,083 --> 00:16:00,501
-ALL: Yes, sir.
-Let's go.

195
00:16:07,841 --> 00:16:09,969
GICHEUL: That's the list
of drug dealers we know.

196
00:16:10,469 --> 00:16:12,721
Starting now, we're going to grill them.

197
00:16:13,514 --> 00:16:15,849
Find out by any means
if they've been in touch

198
00:16:16,725 --> 00:16:18,143
with Choi Jungbae recently.

199
00:16:18,769 --> 00:16:19,770
Yes, Boss.

200
00:16:45,421 --> 00:16:47,214
One day, you'll realize

201
00:16:47,297 --> 00:16:49,466
you were blinded.

202
00:16:56,265 --> 00:16:58,517
This is the list
of Gangnam Crystal dealers.

203
00:16:58,600 --> 00:17:01,437
Jung Gicheul has his boys
searching all of Gangnam,

204
00:17:01,520 --> 00:17:04,606
so I think they'll find
that bastard Choi Jungbae soon.

205
00:17:08,193 --> 00:17:10,029
And when Choi and Oh were in our gang,

206
00:17:10,904 --> 00:17:13,323
these are the phone numbers they used.

207
00:17:13,407 --> 00:17:15,200
Check out their call logs.

208
00:17:16,160 --> 00:17:19,872
I trusted you and made a risky decision.

209
00:17:20,456 --> 00:17:22,416
You disappoint me, Mr. Jung.

210
00:17:23,625 --> 00:17:25,586
This will cause big damage

211
00:17:26,295 --> 00:17:28,922
to not only me but also to you.

212
00:17:29,548 --> 00:17:30,591
I apologize.

213
00:17:31,967 --> 00:17:33,719
I will send it to you at all cost.

214
00:17:33,802 --> 00:17:35,012
I'll give you one week.

215
00:17:35,679 --> 00:17:37,598
I cannot wait any longer than that.

216
00:17:38,348 --> 00:17:39,641
I understand.

217
00:17:39,725 --> 00:17:41,268
I will show no more mercy.

218
00:17:45,731 --> 00:17:46,732
What did he say?

219
00:17:46,815 --> 00:17:47,900
One week.

220
00:17:49,068 --> 00:17:50,569
(SIGHS)

221
00:17:51,528 --> 00:17:53,280
We must get the stuff back at all cost.

222
00:17:53,822 --> 00:17:54,823
Of course.

223
00:17:55,949 --> 00:17:59,119
This was your lifelong dream,
so we have to get it back.

224
00:18:00,913 --> 00:18:01,914
I'll be off then.

225
00:18:07,711 --> 00:18:08,879
By the way, Gicheul...

226
00:18:10,172 --> 00:18:11,548
To be perfectly honest,

227
00:18:11,632 --> 00:18:14,718
I don't see the point in doing this.
We have all of Gangnam.

228
00:18:15,511 --> 00:18:16,553
I mean,

229
00:18:17,763 --> 00:18:21,058
every day, there are new troubles
and it keeps getting dangerous.

230
00:18:22,226 --> 00:18:23,977
So the boys are raising concerns.

231
00:18:24,061 --> 00:18:26,396
Are you saying
we should fucking give up here?

232
00:18:26,480 --> 00:18:27,773
Are you?

233
00:18:27,856 --> 00:18:29,775
I'm just saying we can play it safe...

234
00:18:29,858 --> 00:18:31,485
Fuck being safe!

236
00:18:39,952 --> 00:18:41,453

00:18:41,537 --> 00:18:42,538

00:18:54,716 --> 00:18:57,010
Good afternoon, officers...

241
00:18:57,094 --> 00:18:58,971
Oh, you were alone.

242
00:18:59,054 --> 00:19:03,016
Man, you really need to fix up this place.

243
00:19:03,100 --> 00:19:04,393
How may I help you?

244
00:19:04,476 --> 00:19:07,896
I'm a detective
from Gangnam Police Station in Seoul.

245
00:19:07,980 --> 00:19:09,189
I see.

246
00:19:09,273 --> 00:19:13,026
Is Detective Park Junmo here?

247
00:19:13,110 --> 00:19:14,695
I'm here to visit him.

248
00:19:15,195 --> 00:19:16,738
He's on sick leave right now.

249
00:19:16,822 --> 00:19:17,823
What?

250
00:19:17,906 --> 00:19:18,907
Sick leave?

251
00:19:19,658 --> 00:19:21,785
Is he very ill or something?

252
00:19:22,536 --> 00:19:25,205
No, I don't think it's that serious.

253
00:19:26,039 --> 00:19:27,332
I wonder what's wrong.

254
00:19:28,250 --> 00:19:31,170
I'm sure his wife
cooks for him and everything.

255
00:19:33,505 --> 00:19:36,300
JUNMO: I know you made
a tough decision in trusting me.

256
00:19:37,676 --> 00:19:39,678
But my first trade went south...

257
00:19:41,763 --> 00:19:42,890
I apologize.

258
00:19:42,973 --> 00:19:46,143
At least I know
I was a good judge of character.

259
00:19:46,852 --> 00:19:48,353
You didn't run away

260
00:19:48,979 --> 00:19:50,606
and told me everything honestly.

261
00:19:53,358 --> 00:19:56,195
Making the stuff again is easy,

262
00:19:58,989 --> 00:20:01,575
but finding someone trustworthy isn't.

263
00:20:02,618 --> 00:20:05,746
Haeryun, I'll do whatever it takes
to get the stuff back

264
00:20:07,581 --> 00:20:09,291
and make this trade work again.

265
00:20:14,630 --> 00:20:16,757
I feel like I always owe you. I'm sorry.

266
00:20:17,466 --> 00:20:18,884
Then, pay me back.

267
00:20:28,101 --> 00:20:29,102

270
00:20:53,460 --> 00:20:54,544
Look at how down you are.

271
00:20:56,421 --> 00:20:58,674
I like you because you're confident.

272
00:21:00,050 --> 00:21:01,760
Don't shoulder it all alone.

273
00:21:03,345 --> 00:21:05,013
Let me know if you need any help.

That's what concerns me.

280
00:21:28,120 --> 00:21:30,038
I'm doing this because I want to.

00:21:30,122 --> 00:21:31,498
So please don't feel bad.

00:21:32,207 --> 00:21:33,208
Thank you.

00:21:42,384 --> 00:21:44,511
I used to smell this every morning.

285
00:21:46,471 --> 00:21:48,307
You must have lived near a river.

00:21:49,599 --> 00:21:51,643
Yes, next to Yitong River.

Did something happen?

Is Haeryun being objective
when it comes to that boy, Kwon Seungho?

would cause trouble one day.

doesn't seem that good.

(IN MANDARIN) Changchun, Jilin.

313
00:24:29,968 --> 00:24:32,387
We heard from Korea
they're based in Changchun

314
00:24:32,471 --> 00:24:38,059
and inquired the local police
about the Korean-Chinese gangs there.

315
00:24:38,477 --> 00:24:40,395
The name of the gang is Donghobang.

316
00:24:41,021 --> 00:24:42,898
Their boss is Lee Oson.

317
00:24:43,815 --> 00:24:47,110
Just as our Korean sources said,
it's been confirmed

00:27:34,611 --> 00:27:35,612
Who are you?

367
00:27:38,782 --> 00:27:40,992
Park Junmo from Eumseong Police Station.

368
00:27:42,160 --> 00:27:46,206
Oh. I see. Detective Park Junmo.

369
00:27:49,668 --> 00:27:52,295
I think I've seen him before.

370
00:27:52,962 --> 00:27:53,963
JONGRYEOL: Who?

371
00:27:54,047 --> 00:27:55,048
YONGDAE: Maybe not.

372
00:27:56,216 --> 00:27:57,217
What?

373
00:27:57,300 --> 00:27:58,635
Gosh.

374
00:27:59,928 --> 00:28:01,805
Why did you want to see me?

375
00:28:02,847 --> 00:28:05,767
I was told you were on sick leave,

376
00:28:05,850 --> 00:28:08,061
but you seem healthy.

377
00:28:08,937 --> 00:28:10,063
By the way,

378
00:28:10,772 --> 00:28:15,276
Inspector Yu Euijeong is your wife, right?

379
00:28:15,360 --> 00:28:16,361
Yes. And?

380
00:28:16,444 --> 00:28:18,738
Yu Euijeong's husband, Park Junmo.

381
00:28:19,364 --> 00:28:21,491
Why did he come to see Hwang Mingoo?

382
00:28:21,574 --> 00:28:22,659
Park Junmo?

383
00:28:24,577 --> 00:28:27,414
Is he the husband
of the Boss's girlfriend?

384
00:28:27,497 --> 00:28:30,375
Well, I don't know where to start.

385
00:28:31,668 --> 00:28:33,336
Did you know

386
00:28:33,420 --> 00:28:35,797
your wife was cheating on you?

387
00:28:37,507 --> 00:28:39,384
Of course, you didn't.

388
00:28:39,467 --> 00:28:43,138
The name of this pretty boy
in the picture is Jung Gicheul.

389
00:28:43,221 --> 00:28:44,472
He's a thug in Gangnam.

390
00:28:44,556 --> 00:28:47,809
The lady next to him.
She's your wife, right?

391
00:28:48,435 --> 00:28:49,728
Yes. And?

392
00:28:50,395 --> 00:28:53,606
(SCOFFS) What do you mean, "Yes. And?"

393
00:28:53,690 --> 00:28:55,191
It's weird.

394
00:28:55,275 --> 00:28:58,653
Your wife is having a good time
with some other man.

395
00:28:58,737 --> 00:28:59,821
Isn't this messed up?

396
00:29:00,280 --> 00:29:02,699
Could you stop caring
about our family's business

397
00:29:02,782 --> 00:29:04,909
and mind your own?

398
00:29:04,993 --> 00:29:06,870
What? How could you say that?

399
00:29:06,953 --> 00:29:08,955
I told you this for your sake.

400
00:29:10,749 --> 00:29:12,417
I'll take care of my family's business.

401
00:29:12,500 --> 00:29:13,501
What?

402
00:29:13,585 --> 00:29:15,253
You look like a pretty young man.

403
00:29:15,336 --> 00:29:16,880
Do you already want to retire?

404
00:29:16,963 --> 00:29:19,090
How could you talk to me like that?

405
00:29:19,174 --> 00:29:21,593
I feel bad watching you playing detective.

406
00:29:22,427 --> 00:29:23,595
I'll get going now.

407
00:29:36,775 --> 00:29:38,026
Right!

408
00:29:38,109 --> 00:29:39,986
I remember now. I've seen him before.

409
00:29:41,070 --> 00:29:42,071
Where?

410
00:29:42,155 --> 00:29:44,407
When I went to get
this document Boss asked for,

411
00:29:44,491 --> 00:29:45,492
I saw him there.

412
00:29:45,575 --> 00:29:46,618
I'm sure of it.

413
00:29:46,701 --> 00:29:48,411
I'm fucking smart.

414
00:29:50,371 --> 00:29:52,207
What the fuck is going on?

415
00:29:54,083 --> 00:29:58,213
We can't seem to locate
this guy called Meth Park on the list.

416
00:30:00,173 --> 00:30:01,508
If we can't fix this,

417
00:30:02,759 --> 00:30:04,177
we might get in big trouble.

418
00:30:04,260 --> 00:30:07,430
I paged him to lure him out.

419
00:30:07,514 --> 00:30:08,848
I'm sure he'll contact us.

420
00:30:08,932 --> 00:30:10,809
What? He'll contact us?

421
00:30:11,309 --> 00:30:12,310
You piece of shit.

422
00:30:14,103 --> 00:30:15,438
Follow me.

423
00:30:15,522 --> 00:30:17,565
Follow me, you son of a bitch.

424
00:30:17,649 --> 00:30:21,653
You go out right now,
do whatever it God damn takes

425
00:30:21,736 --> 00:30:24,197
and bring that bastard Meth Park to me.

426
00:30:25,156 --> 00:30:26,825
-Go get him!
-Seungho.

427
00:30:28,076 --> 00:30:29,327
Can we talk for a moment?

428
00:30:34,624 --> 00:30:36,000
In times like these,

429
00:30:36,084 --> 00:30:38,336
we've got to be level-headed.

430
00:30:38,920 --> 00:30:40,922
The stuff we lost was worth millions...

431
00:30:41,005 --> 00:30:42,882
No, it was worth billions of won.

432
00:30:43,508 --> 00:30:45,176
This might fuck everything up...

433
00:30:45,260 --> 00:30:46,970
We know that!

434
00:30:47,053 --> 00:30:49,764
So our boys are working
their asses off to find it now!

435
00:30:49,848 --> 00:30:52,725
Who the fuck did they find
after working their asses off?

436
00:30:52,809 --> 00:30:54,644
What the fuck did you just say?

437
00:30:54,727 --> 00:30:55,728
Enough.

438
00:30:55,812 --> 00:30:56,813
Say that again.

439
00:30:57,522 --> 00:30:59,399
Get a grip. I'm Hong Heesung.

440
00:31:00,316 --> 00:31:01,442
Hong Heesung.

441
00:31:02,485 --> 00:31:05,738
Contact all our alumni
and see if any one of them

442
00:31:06,573 --> 00:31:09,033
are in touch
with Choi Jungbae and Oh Kyungjin.

443
00:31:09,117 --> 00:31:10,368
You motherfucker--

444
00:31:10,451 --> 00:31:12,036
(SHOUTS) What the fuck are you doing?

445
00:31:12,787 --> 00:31:13,788
Go.

446
00:31:16,958 --> 00:31:18,084
We'll talk later.

447
00:31:23,923 --> 00:31:25,717
(DOOR OPENS, CLOSES)

448
00:31:32,807 --> 00:31:36,728
Boss, I met Haeryun the other day.

449
00:31:37,729 --> 00:31:40,273
Because we lost all of the stuff

450
00:31:41,482 --> 00:31:43,067
and haven't paid them yet,

451
00:31:44,444 --> 00:31:45,904
they seemed to be in trouble.

452
00:31:47,739 --> 00:31:48,740
It's gone.

453
00:31:49,741 --> 00:31:50,742
What?

454
00:31:50,825 --> 00:31:52,660
That day we went to get the stuff,

455
00:31:53,995 --> 00:31:56,706
Choi Jungbae came to our office
and took everything.

456
00:31:59,208 --> 00:32:01,294
God damn it!

457
00:32:01,377 --> 00:32:05,882
Choi Jungbae, that fucking bastard!
(YELLS)

458
00:32:07,175 --> 00:32:08,426
(EXHALES)

459
00:32:10,053 --> 00:32:13,473
Boss, does he have family or relatives?

460
00:32:14,599 --> 00:32:17,393
Shouldn't we go fuck them up

461
00:32:17,477 --> 00:32:19,395
to find where he is?

462
00:32:20,855 --> 00:32:22,106
Seungho.

463
00:32:23,691 --> 00:32:24,692
Kwon Seungho.

464
00:32:29,948 --> 00:32:31,282
Don't cross the line.

465
00:32:37,997 --> 00:32:38,998
You can go now.

466
00:32:56,265 --> 00:32:57,350
(PHONE RINGING)

467
00:32:57,725 --> 00:32:58,726
Hello?

468
00:33:02,438 --> 00:33:04,190
What's up?

469
00:33:04,273 --> 00:33:05,400
Is it urgent?

470
00:33:06,734 --> 00:33:09,153
I said I'd call you when it all ends.

471
00:33:09,237 --> 00:33:11,239
Dohyung told me about everything.

472
00:33:13,074 --> 00:33:15,535
-Let's talk in person.
-(EXHALES SHARPLY)

473
00:33:20,665 --> 00:33:22,417
Hello. Do you remember me?

474
00:33:23,042 --> 00:33:24,293
Yes.

475
00:33:25,169 --> 00:33:28,589
The captain of our crime unit
wants to ask some questions.

476
00:33:28,673 --> 00:33:30,008
He's here in person.

477
00:33:30,717 --> 00:33:32,343
Do you have time?

478
00:33:33,594 --> 00:33:36,264
Oh, sure.

479
00:33:36,347 --> 00:33:37,473
This way, please.

480
00:33:40,768 --> 00:33:42,562
It won't take long. Please get in.

481
00:33:50,528 --> 00:33:51,696
DOHYUNG: There he is.

482
00:33:56,617 --> 00:34:00,038
These are the communication and call logs
of the suspects you gave Dohyung.

483
00:34:01,247 --> 00:34:04,542
Choi Jungbae and Oh Kyungjin
haven't called that number yet.

484
00:34:05,918 --> 00:34:08,880
And this is the address
of where Choi Jungbae's parents live.

485
00:34:11,716 --> 00:34:14,260
These bastards must be
in contact with each other

486
00:34:14,343 --> 00:34:15,344
to sell the stuff.

487
00:34:16,304 --> 00:34:18,473
So Dohyung, make sure
to check the records often.

488
00:34:20,141 --> 00:34:21,350
Also,

489
00:34:21,434 --> 00:34:24,645
you could've told me about this
over the phone.

490
00:34:25,688 --> 00:34:28,691
You know we don't have time.

491
00:34:31,611 --> 00:34:32,737
I have to go.

492
00:34:35,823 --> 00:34:36,908
EUIJEONG: Junmo.

493
00:34:39,243 --> 00:34:40,244
JONGRYEOL: What did he say?

494
00:34:43,873 --> 00:34:45,541
Junmo, are you okay?

495
00:34:47,585 --> 00:34:48,586
Am I okay?

496
00:34:50,588 --> 00:34:51,631
Euijeong, you know

497
00:34:52,548 --> 00:34:54,967
what situation I'm in. Don't you?

498
00:34:55,968 --> 00:34:57,136
Do I look okay to you?

499
00:34:59,305 --> 00:35:00,973
Tell me if it's too much. I'll help--

500
00:35:01,057 --> 00:35:02,975
Help me with what?

501
00:35:04,060 --> 00:35:06,938
What is it that you can do
in this investigation?

502
00:35:09,065 --> 00:35:11,400
Stop showing up and distracting me.

503
00:35:11,484 --> 00:35:13,486
Just stay out of this investigation

504
00:35:14,362 --> 00:35:15,738
if you really want to help.

505
00:35:17,240 --> 00:35:18,407
Junmo...

506
00:35:19,992 --> 00:35:21,119
WOMAN: He said he was a cop.

507
00:35:21,911 --> 00:35:23,371
He needed to swap the documents.

508
00:35:23,454 --> 00:35:24,455
Damn it.

509
00:35:25,289 --> 00:35:29,085
Say it clearly. Word for word.

510
00:35:30,461 --> 00:35:32,547
He said he was a narcotics officer,

511
00:35:32,630 --> 00:35:34,257
so I did what he asked me to do.

512
00:35:34,799 --> 00:35:37,385
He said he needed some help
with his investigation.

513
00:35:38,302 --> 00:35:39,303
A narcotics officer?

514
00:35:40,388 --> 00:35:41,389
Investigation?

515
00:35:41,472 --> 00:35:42,557
Park Junmo.

516
00:35:42,640 --> 00:35:44,642
Why have you changed so much?

517
00:35:44,725 --> 00:35:46,561
You're a cop. Get it together.

518
00:35:46,644 --> 00:35:47,979
I fucking know! I'm a cop,

519
00:35:48,062 --> 00:35:50,022
so that's why I'm doing
this investigation.

520
00:35:50,523 --> 00:35:51,566
Okay?

521
00:35:52,567 --> 00:35:54,360
And why have I changed so much?

522
00:35:55,403 --> 00:35:58,156
Who pushed me to this point? Eh?

523
00:35:59,615 --> 00:36:03,911
Who dragged not only me but also Euijeong
into this fucking investigation?

524
00:36:03,995 --> 00:36:06,247
Who the fuck was it?

525
00:36:07,874 --> 00:36:10,626
-Junmo, please.
-Who made me lose my mind

526
00:36:10,710 --> 00:36:13,588
and cause someone's death? Eh?

527
00:36:15,173 --> 00:36:17,133
It was fucking you and Cho Changsik.

528
00:36:17,216 --> 00:36:18,426
Hey.

529
00:36:18,509 --> 00:36:20,303
-Am I wrong?
-EUIJEONG: Junmo.

530
00:36:20,386 --> 00:36:21,429
You know I'm right.

531
00:36:21,512 --> 00:36:23,222
I know this is hard on you.

532
00:36:24,557 --> 00:36:28,102
But you must stay strong.

533
00:36:30,938 --> 00:36:32,190
Junmo.

534
00:36:42,158 --> 00:36:45,077
He's going through a lot.

535
00:36:45,912 --> 00:36:47,163
Please be understanding.

00:36:50,541 --> 00:36:52,543
(PHONE RINGING)

537
00:36:54,795 --> 00:36:56,255
Hello, Seok Dohyung speaking.

538
00:36:56,339 --> 00:36:59,425
Hello, Detective. This is
the Retired Police Association Hall.

539
00:36:59,508 --> 00:37:01,719
Hello. What's the matter?

540
00:37:01,802 --> 00:37:04,639
You asked me to call you
if that person returned.

541
00:37:05,181 --> 00:37:06,265
Did he come again?

542
00:37:06,682 --> 00:37:07,683
Yes.

543
00:37:07,767 --> 00:37:11,145
He asked me to show that document
from before and other ones too.

544
00:37:11,229 --> 00:37:12,647
But I didn't know what to do.

545
00:37:13,773 --> 00:37:15,775
He said he'd come tomorrow morning.

546
00:37:15,858 --> 00:37:18,110
I'll be right there.

547
00:37:22,240 --> 00:37:23,366
He's coming right now.

548
00:37:24,909 --> 00:37:26,410
Did something happen?

549
00:37:26,494 --> 00:37:30,164
Gangnam Union has started to move again.

550
00:37:31,082 --> 00:37:33,042
It's where private detective
Cheon Jinpyung

551
00:37:33,125 --> 00:37:35,294
discovered Junmo's identity,

552
00:37:35,378 --> 00:37:38,172
and Gangnam Union's men have returned.

553
00:37:39,548 --> 00:37:41,259
I'll go check out the place.

554
00:37:41,342 --> 00:37:44,762
So I'd like you to keep
an eye on Jung Gicheul.

556
00:37:51,018 --> 00:37:52,019
Be careful.

557
00:37:55,106 --> 00:37:56,107
You too.

558
00:37:57,358 --> 00:37:58,359
Excuse me,

559
00:37:58,442 --> 00:37:59,652
Chief Seo?

560
00:38:00,194 --> 00:38:02,321
Shouldn't we report this to Boss?

561
00:38:02,989 --> 00:38:06,701
We can report to him
after confirming if we were right.

562
00:38:10,788 --> 00:38:14,709
But will it be okay to meet
a cop in person like this?

563
00:38:15,668 --> 00:38:16,752
What about cops?

564
00:38:18,212 --> 00:38:19,213
Are they any different?

565
00:38:20,298 --> 00:38:21,382
No, sir.

566
00:38:22,466 --> 00:38:24,552
If you stab them, they die just like us.

Chief Seo, are you out now?

578
00:39:10,473 --> 00:39:11,515
Where are you?

579
00:39:11,932 --> 00:39:14,226
We have a fucking emergency at our office.

580
00:39:14,310 --> 00:39:15,770
Choi Jungbae, that bastard...

581
00:39:16,896 --> 00:39:18,272
Let's meet and talk.

582
00:39:19,106 --> 00:39:21,067
I need to catch a rat first.

583
00:39:21,567 --> 00:39:23,235
Come over here now. And alone.

584
00:39:23,819 --> 00:39:24,862
What?

585
00:39:25,696 --> 00:39:27,281
What are you talking about?

586
00:39:28,115 --> 00:39:29,158
Write this down.

587
00:39:30,701 --> 00:39:34,538
It's 361-5, Nokbeon-dong, Eunpyeong-gu.

Nokbeon-dong? What's there?

589
00:39:39,001 --> 00:39:40,378
The Retired Police Association.

590
00:39:41,295 --> 00:39:42,421
Come right now.

591
00:39:49,929 --> 00:39:50,971
Fuck.

592
00:39:59,730 --> 00:40:00,731
EUIJEONG: Gicheul.

593
00:40:01,982 --> 00:40:03,692
Do you remember you once said

594
00:40:04,193 --> 00:40:05,945
that if anyone visited Gangnam,

595
00:40:06,028 --> 00:40:08,948
you wanted it so they had to
visit one of your stores?

596
00:40:10,408 --> 00:40:12,076
Your dream came true, right?

597
00:40:15,371 --> 00:40:19,375
So couldn't you stop
what you're doing now?

598
00:40:20,584 --> 00:40:21,752
It looks too dangerous.

599
00:40:24,338 --> 00:40:27,967
Euijeong, my dream
hasn't come completely true yet.

600
00:40:30,302 --> 00:40:32,471
I said I'd become
the "emperor of the night,"

601
00:40:33,848 --> 00:40:37,309
and I would marry you.

603

You're right. I can stop here.

604
00:40:47,403 --> 00:40:49,363
But I'm this close to the end.

605
00:40:50,072 --> 00:40:51,532
It would be a shame to give up now.

606
00:40:56,162 --> 00:40:57,329
Don't worry.

607
00:40:58,247 --> 00:40:59,331
I'll sort it all out.

-Our boys are hauling him to the office.

613

Okay, I'll be right there.

614
00:41:14,972 --> 00:41:16,474

What is it?

616
00:41:17,641 --> 00:41:19,018

Yu Euijeong's husband, right?

621

-I found him.
-Who's the cop?

637
00:44:15,903 --> 00:44:17,946

-Open up.
-What?

-go hide somewhere.

What's going on here?

652
00:46:06,972 --> 00:46:07,973
Park Junmo.

Husband of the Boss's girl.

654
00:46:12,144 --> 00:46:13,145
You know him, right?

655
00:46:14,104 --> 00:46:16,190
You said you knew that cop, Yu Euijeong.

656
00:46:17,399 --> 00:46:18,901
You must know her husband too.

00:46:23,614 --> 00:46:25,282
I do.

But he's a cop.

660
00:46:28,494 --> 00:46:31,288
I thought Yu Euijeong and her husband

661
00:46:32,706 --> 00:46:34,917
schemed up this plan to get us.

But there was more to this fucking shit.

Seok Dohyung of SMPA's
Narcotic Crime Investigation Division.

to be Park Junmo?

Hey.

667
00:47:03,987 --> 00:47:05,948
You know something about this, right?

668
00:47:13,705 --> 00:47:14,706
I guess you don't.

669
00:47:18,669 --> 00:47:20,462
Well, we can just ask him then.

670
00:47:22,256 --> 00:47:23,757
He was carrying this.

671
00:47:24,675 --> 00:47:25,843
I guess because he's a cop.

672
00:47:28,804 --> 00:47:30,180
Wait, Chief.

673
00:47:30,264 --> 00:47:31,265
God damn it.

674
00:47:32,266 --> 00:47:36,728
Look, if we kill a cop
in a situation like this,

00:47:37,437 --> 00:47:39,898
things will get fucking complicated.

is in cahoots with the cops.
