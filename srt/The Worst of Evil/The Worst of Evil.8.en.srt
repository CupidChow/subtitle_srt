When will you be back?

5
00:00:23,648 --> 00:00:25,191
The hunt's taking quite long.

00:00:25,692 --> 00:00:27,852
HAERYUN: (IN KOREAN)
It's quite interesting here, Papa.

7
00:00:28,361 --> 00:00:30,697
Can I stay a bit longer
to watch these two gangs?

8
00:00:30,780 --> 00:00:31,865
(IN MANDARIN) Of course.

9
00:00:31,948 --> 00:00:35,118
Whether it's meat or people,
you have to weigh them yourself.

10

11

00:00:45,378 --> 00:00:46,379
Sorry, ma'am.

14
00:00:49,883 --> 00:00:53,553
Haeryun must be having
a good time in Seoul.

Have you decided who?

17
00:01:01,978 --> 00:01:04,064
(SIGHS) Jung Gicheul.

18
00:01:05,315 --> 00:01:07,567
We showed him mercy by allowing him

19
00:01:07,650 --> 00:01:09,778
to leverage our trust to build wealth.

20
00:01:12,781 --> 00:01:15,325
So he'll have to pay the price
for ruining the deal.

21
00:01:18,453 --> 00:01:19,621
- Jinhwa.
- (IN MANDARIN) Yes?

22
00:01:20,205 --> 00:01:21,372
Give the kids their tea.

23
00:01:21,915 --> 00:01:22,916
Okay.

24
00:01:51,444 --> 00:01:52,445
Raise your cups!

25
00:01:59,244 --> 00:02:02,372
This is Father's blood

26
00:02:03,081 --> 00:02:04,374
and our brothers' sweat!

27
00:02:05,708 --> 00:02:07,252
Drink with gratitude!

28
00:02:09,212 --> 00:02:11,381
We're a family who shares blood and sweat.

29
00:02:11,881 --> 00:02:14,300
If you ever betray the family's trust,

30
00:02:15,593 --> 00:02:17,053
you'll have to pay the price!

31
00:02:17,846 --> 00:02:19,264

32
00:02:19,347 --> 00:02:20,682

THE WORST OF EVIL

34
00:02:48,209 --> 00:02:49,711
(IN MANDARIN) Such poor hospitality.

35
00:02:51,004 --> 00:02:53,006
(IN KOREAN) What is she saying?

36
00:02:55,300 --> 00:02:56,467
By the way,

37
00:02:56,551 --> 00:02:59,637
both your father and the Japanese boss

38
00:02:59,721 --> 00:03:02,473
deserve to have books
written about their lives.

39
00:03:02,557 --> 00:03:05,268
So I just don't understand

40
00:03:05,351 --> 00:03:08,146
why such great people worked with a nobody

41
00:03:08,229 --> 00:03:10,064
like Jung Gicheul.

42
00:03:10,148 --> 00:03:11,816
Thirty million per kilogram.

43
00:03:11,900 --> 00:03:12,942
And ten kilograms.

44
00:03:13,735 --> 00:03:15,069
Will you accept this deal?

45
00:03:16,196 --> 00:03:19,240
Normally, I don't deal with drugs.

46
00:03:22,243 --> 00:03:23,828
Okay, 20 million per kilogram.

47
00:03:24,871 --> 00:03:26,748
I'm pretty sure I just spoke in Korean.

48
00:03:27,248 --> 00:03:28,583
Make it 25 million.

49
00:03:30,585 --> 00:03:34,047
How dare you look
right into my eyes, young lady?

50
00:03:35,048 --> 00:03:37,425
- Hey, Bboknam.
- Yes, Boss?

51
00:03:37,508 --> 00:03:39,928
Is that acceptable etiquette
in our country?

52
00:03:40,553 --> 00:03:43,640
Her father may deserve his own book,
but he didn't teach her manners.

53
00:03:43,765 --> 00:03:46,559
- (LAUGHS)
- What a money-grubber.

54
00:03:46,643 --> 00:03:48,770
That's an incurable disease, you know.

55
00:03:49,812 --> 00:03:50,980
Should I drop by a pharmacy?

56
00:03:51,064 --> 00:03:53,483
Go get her some medicine.

57
00:04:23,763 --> 00:04:26,432
Am I here to make a deal
with a mom-and-pop store?

58
00:04:29,435 --> 00:04:31,688
Not knowing your place

59
00:04:33,481 --> 00:04:34,857
is also a disease, you know.

60
00:04:35,817 --> 00:04:36,901
(SNIGGERS)

61
00:04:38,611 --> 00:04:40,405
Fine. 30 million.

62
00:04:40,488 --> 00:04:42,949
Thirty million it is, okay?

63
00:04:46,828 --> 00:04:48,997
We have to take out Jung Gicheul.

64
00:04:49,622 --> 00:04:51,833
He won't just let us
take away his cash flow.

65
00:04:51,916 --> 00:04:54,669
We have to get rid of him
before he makes a move.

66
00:04:57,005 --> 00:04:59,382
He personally owes me too.

67
00:04:59,966 --> 00:05:03,094
So you want to cause a stir
and let everyone know

68
00:05:03,177 --> 00:05:04,512
that you're dealing drugs?

69
00:05:06,681 --> 00:05:08,850
In China, you get
the death penalty for that.

70
00:05:10,351 --> 00:05:13,146

71
00:05:16,274 --> 00:05:17,275

72
00:05:19,819 --> 00:05:21,237

onto something?

our investigation is going smoothly.

then how did Cheon Jinpyung
find out about us? Eh?

It's true that we didn't know
he'd look into it that far.

100
00:07:06,968 --> 00:07:10,847
But if he was certain
about his suspicions,

101
00:07:10,930 --> 00:07:13,057
he wouldn't have let
Euijeong go like that.

102
00:07:13,850 --> 00:07:17,979
And you made an excellent decision.

103
00:07:18,354 --> 00:07:20,440
If you'd let him report to Jung Gicheul,

104
00:07:20,523 --> 00:07:22,859

to wrap things up with the Chinese.

- Also,

there's a chance

119
00:08:30,635 --> 00:08:33,638
the Chinese and Japanese
could've found a new Korean carrier.

120
00:08:36,015 --> 00:08:38,184
Let's keep an eye on the Japanese

121

00:09:09,757 --> 00:09:13,302
So don't worry, and trust me.

132
00:09:14,011 --> 00:09:15,513
I'll wrap it up nicely.

133
00:09:18,099 --> 00:09:20,810
Cheon Jinpyung was Jung Gicheul's partner.

134
00:09:20,893 --> 00:09:22,812
So he was one
of our investigation targets.

135
00:09:22,895 --> 00:09:25,690
So since he's connected
to Jung Gicheul, it's fine if he died?

136
00:09:26,399 --> 00:09:28,776
Detective Park's cover was almost blown.

137
00:09:30,152 --> 00:09:34,448
Anyway, he witnessed a man's death,

138
00:09:34,532 --> 00:09:36,158

into a deadly situation,

is more people. He needs backup.

180
00:11:56,048 --> 00:11:58,676
- Give it to me. I'll do it, sir.
- No, I'm done.

181
00:11:59,093 --> 00:12:00,469
Go get ready now.

182
00:12:00,553 --> 00:12:02,304
Aren't you meeting Lee Haeryun today?

183
00:12:02,388 --> 00:12:03,472
Yes, sir. I am.

184
00:12:03,556 --> 00:12:05,891
Make sure to get it done right.

185
00:12:05,975 --> 00:12:06,976
Yes, Boss.

186
00:12:10,563 --> 00:12:11,564
Right.

187
00:12:14,942 --> 00:12:15,943
Wear that.

188
00:12:16,402 --> 00:12:17,486
What is this, sir?

189
00:12:22,408 --> 00:12:23,409
Thank you, sir.

190
00:12:28,581 --> 00:12:29,623
You said before

191
00:12:31,417 --> 00:12:32,918
that you wouldn't let me down.

192
00:12:33,919 --> 00:12:35,129
I really hope you won't.

193
00:12:36,589 --> 00:12:37,590
I won't, Boss.

Thank you.

197
00:12:56,567 --> 00:12:57,568
You too, Mr. Jung.

198
00:12:58,652 --> 00:12:59,653
You look great.

199
00:13:00,446 --> 00:13:01,489
Did you come alone?

200
00:13:01,572 --> 00:13:04,200
Yes. It's a date, after all.

201
00:13:04,658 --> 00:13:05,910
- Shall we?
- Okay.

202
00:13:09,205 --> 00:13:11,040
Hi, Gicheul. Were you waiting for me?

203
00:13:12,625 --> 00:13:13,626
Hey, Euijeong.

204
00:13:14,794 --> 00:13:15,795
Hey.

205
00:13:16,462 --> 00:13:18,130
Are you going somewhere, Seungho?

206
00:13:18,923 --> 00:13:20,090
Yes.

207
00:13:20,174 --> 00:13:22,593
But what brings you here?

208
00:13:24,720 --> 00:13:26,847
Open the door. It's our first date.

209
00:13:27,848 --> 00:13:28,849

210
00:13:35,189 --> 00:13:37,149
I hope you two have a good time.

211
00:13:37,233 --> 00:13:39,068
Have fun. Call me if anything happens.

212
00:13:39,652 --> 00:13:40,653
I will, Boss.

- Okay.

Where would you like to go today?

216
00:14:00,756 --> 00:14:04,468
Who was that lady next to Seungho?

217
00:14:04,969 --> 00:14:07,596
One of our clients
who's running a liquor business.

218
00:14:08,097 --> 00:14:11,308
I see. So it's for business.

219
00:14:14,228 --> 00:14:15,312
She likes Seungho.

220
00:14:18,482 --> 00:14:19,483
How do you know?

That's a sofa.

229
00:14:47,011 --> 00:14:49,138
There's also gym equipment for fitness.

230
00:14:54,602 --> 00:14:56,353
Do you live here?

231
00:14:56,437 --> 00:14:58,147
No, this is where Seungho lives.

232
00:15:05,446 --> 00:15:06,864
- Euijeong.
- Yes?

- Okay.

Okay.

00:15:28,969 --> 00:15:30,054
So what do you think?

Yes, sir.

No, I'm not busy.

What should we do today?

261

there's a place I want to take you to.

in Seoul, but why here?

00:17:54,948 --> 00:17:57,659
Mr. Jung also had
a tough childhood like me.

274
00:17:57,743 --> 00:18:00,037
There must be a reason why some people

They said that man fell
from the roof by accident.

and they said there was no phone.

and when we held
my mom's memorial service,

355
00:23:53,140 --> 00:23:56,435
I realized how genuinely
you cared about me.

356
00:23:59,604 --> 00:24:00,939
Are you sure?

357
00:24:02,441 --> 00:24:03,567
What do you mean?

00:24:07,362 --> 00:24:09,114
You've never lived in Wonju, right?

359
00:24:13,535 --> 00:24:15,370
No, I've never lived there.

360
00:24:16,538 --> 00:24:18,123

00:24:24,546 --> 00:24:28,341
My mom had been ill for a long time.

363
00:24:29,176 --> 00:24:32,179
So she had to go
to the hospital in Seoul regularly,

364
00:24:33,305 --> 00:24:36,099
and my mom and dad had to live separately.

365
00:24:36,892 --> 00:24:41,688
Because of that, I had to travel
between Seoul and Wonju regularly.

366
00:24:44,566 --> 00:24:47,569
How did you know I used to be in Wonju?

367
00:24:48,820 --> 00:24:50,947
I don't think I've told you about it.

368
00:24:51,740 --> 00:24:53,241
Seungho told me.

369
00:24:55,035 --> 00:24:57,162
He said you two were close
when you were young

370
00:24:57,245 --> 00:24:59,289
and you moved to Seoul in middle school.

371
00:25:01,416 --> 00:25:02,918
But the people at church

372
00:25:03,418 --> 00:25:05,795
seemed to remember you
from elementary school,

373
00:25:07,255 --> 00:25:08,924
so I thought that was odd.

374
00:25:09,591 --> 00:25:11,593
I moved when I was in elementary school.

375
00:25:13,220 --> 00:25:16,223
It was a long time ago,
so Seungho must've been confused.

376
00:25:19,935 --> 00:25:24,648
But does that cause
any issues in our relationship?

377
00:25:31,404 --> 00:25:33,281
(PHONE RINGING)

378
00:25:39,621 --> 00:25:40,622
Hello?

379
00:25:40,705 --> 00:25:42,958
I got the document, sir.

380
00:25:43,208 --> 00:25:45,126
At first, I got a flat no.

381
00:25:45,210 --> 00:25:48,505
So I had to do all kinds of cute things
I used to do as a kid.

382
00:25:49,297 --> 00:25:53,134
Anyway, that document
Cheon Jinpyung got yesterday.

383
00:25:53,593 --> 00:25:56,388
I have a copy of it right now.

384
00:25:56,846 --> 00:25:58,223
Do you want me to read it?

385
00:25:58,306 --> 00:26:00,267
- Yeah.
- One second.

386
00:26:02,561 --> 00:26:04,729
"Yu Dukhoon. Work history."

387
00:26:12,445 --> 00:26:13,446
All right. Thanks.

388
00:26:27,586 --> 00:26:28,587
Euijeong.

389
00:26:29,963 --> 00:26:31,423
Could you turn around for a bit?

390
00:27:12,172 --> 00:27:14,215
(EUIJEONG BREATHING SHAKILY)

391
00:27:28,480 --> 00:27:29,981
I'm sorry if I upset you.

392
00:27:30,190 --> 00:27:31,775
It was just a misunderstanding.

393
00:27:33,943 --> 00:27:35,236
That necklace is

394
00:27:36,029 --> 00:27:37,781
the promise I made in high school.

395
00:27:38,657 --> 00:27:40,492
I said I'd give you something nicer.

396
00:27:49,542 --> 00:27:50,835
The wind is chilly.

397
00:27:52,045 --> 00:27:53,588
Let's go inside.

398
00:27:57,300 --> 00:28:01,554
"Address, 512-9, Bongsan-dong, Wonju."

399
00:28:02,972 --> 00:28:04,224
Interesting.

400
00:28:19,322 --> 00:28:20,657
How may I help you?

401
00:28:27,122 --> 00:28:28,748
You're so beautiful.

402
00:28:33,878 --> 00:28:35,171
Sorry?

403
00:28:35,672 --> 00:28:37,173
Oh, sorry.

404
00:28:38,842 --> 00:28:42,053
All right, Bae Yongdae. Nostradamus.

405
00:28:42,554 --> 00:28:43,972
Let's give it a shot.

406
00:28:45,974 --> 00:28:47,809
Thank you for your cooperation.

407
00:28:48,476 --> 00:28:52,313
If that person or anyone
who wants to talk about this comes here,

408
00:28:52,772 --> 00:28:54,524
please call me.

409
00:28:54,607 --> 00:28:55,817
Yes, I will.

410
00:29:09,456 --> 00:29:12,542
(DOOR OPENS, CLOSES)

411
00:29:16,504 --> 00:29:17,547
Is...

412
00:29:18,465 --> 00:29:20,008
Is he your boyfriend?

413
00:29:21,885 --> 00:29:22,969
No?

414
00:29:23,595 --> 00:29:24,721
No.

415
00:29:27,140 --> 00:29:30,769
It was on the way. And this was
the last one left. (CHUCKLES NERVOUSLY)

416
00:29:31,352 --> 00:29:32,937
- Is that for me?
- Yes.

417
00:29:33,229 --> 00:29:34,272
- Please, take it.
- Okay.

418
00:29:34,355 --> 00:29:35,356
Sir.

419
00:29:36,149 --> 00:29:37,942
- Sir.
- What is it?

420
00:29:40,111 --> 00:29:42,238
You know Cheon Jinpyung, right? Mr. Cheon?

421
00:29:42,739 --> 00:29:43,740
He died yesterday.

422
00:29:44,574 --> 00:29:45,658
Who's that?

423
00:29:45,742 --> 00:29:47,827
He worked under Chief at Namdaemun.

424
00:29:48,661 --> 00:29:51,873
The one who got fired for bribery
and became a private detective.

425
00:29:51,956 --> 00:29:53,541
I caught him for forgery last year.

426
00:29:53,958 --> 00:29:54,959
What about him?

427
00:29:55,043 --> 00:29:58,922
Did you know he was working
for Jung Gicheul's Gangnam Union?

428
00:30:05,053 --> 00:30:06,137
(GRUNTS IN PAIN)

429
00:30:16,272 --> 00:30:17,524
Where and how did he die?

430
00:30:19,859 --> 00:30:23,530
I couldn't play like this
when I was young.

431
00:30:24,030 --> 00:30:26,741
You know the scary-looking guy
who always follows me around?

432
00:30:27,617 --> 00:30:29,869
He's always been with me.

433
00:30:29,953 --> 00:30:31,538
So I never had a friend.

434
00:30:32,872 --> 00:30:35,667
Can you imagine
how frustrating that was as a kid?

435
00:30:35,792 --> 00:30:37,585
(CLACKING)

436
00:30:37,669 --> 00:30:38,837
Do you get it now?

437
00:30:39,629 --> 00:30:41,172
What am I to make of

438
00:30:44,008 --> 00:30:45,718
hanging out with you like this?

439
00:30:49,097 --> 00:30:51,933
I'm trying to understand your past
as best as I can.

440
00:30:54,686 --> 00:30:56,020
A bit corny, right?

441
00:30:56,688 --> 00:30:58,273
So as you said,

442
00:30:59,440 --> 00:31:00,859
you wanted to see how I grew up.

443
00:31:02,402 --> 00:31:04,779
So what do you think? Hmm?

444
00:31:13,872 --> 00:31:15,999
- Here.
- BOY: Thank you.

445
00:31:18,293 --> 00:31:20,962
Being loyal, risking your life,

446
00:31:22,130 --> 00:31:23,673
and risking danger.

447
00:31:25,091 --> 00:31:27,135
Now I get why.

448
00:31:31,389 --> 00:31:34,434
My father would love to see you.

449
00:31:36,603 --> 00:31:37,604
Aren't you hungry?

450
00:31:39,022 --> 00:31:40,189
Let's go eat.

451
00:31:41,691 --> 00:31:43,234
Now, we'll do things my way.

452
00:31:48,031 --> 00:31:49,032
Heesung.

453
00:31:54,370 --> 00:31:55,788
Those fucking pricks.

454
00:33:10,488 --> 00:33:11,572
Why aren't you eating?

455
00:33:13,074 --> 00:33:16,953
Well, watching you makes me feel full.

456
00:33:23,835 --> 00:33:26,337
The woman with Mr. Jung this morning.

457
00:33:27,588 --> 00:33:28,589
Who is she?

458
00:33:29,924 --> 00:33:30,967
His girlfriend?

459
00:33:32,093 --> 00:33:33,219
I don't think so.

460
00:33:34,303 --> 00:33:35,388
They must be.

461
00:33:36,055 --> 00:33:38,182
They were looking at each other so dearly.

462
00:33:40,852 --> 00:33:41,894
Gicheul.

463
00:33:44,647 --> 00:33:45,732
Are you suspicious of me?

464
00:33:47,233 --> 00:33:48,317
Because I'm a cop?

465
00:33:51,529 --> 00:33:52,905
I thought you already knew

466
00:33:53,489 --> 00:33:54,824
what kind of work I did.

467
00:33:55,825 --> 00:33:56,868
Yes, I know.

468
00:33:57,535 --> 00:33:59,454
I know what you're doing isn't ordinary.

469
00:34:00,371 --> 00:34:01,622
- But...
- A thug.

470
00:34:04,167 --> 00:34:05,668
That's what everyone calls me.

471
00:34:07,170 --> 00:34:09,338
To be honest, they're not wrong though.

472
00:34:12,258 --> 00:34:13,259
At first,

473
00:34:14,761 --> 00:34:16,971
I thought we ran into each other
by coincidence.

474
00:34:18,514 --> 00:34:20,349
I'd been hoping for a while to meet you,

475
00:34:21,225 --> 00:34:23,102
so I often visited our old hang out spots.

476
00:34:25,813 --> 00:34:27,607
But after meeting you again,

477
00:34:28,107 --> 00:34:29,776
so many things started to happen.

478
00:34:31,944 --> 00:34:33,946
Seungho and you knew each other.

479
00:34:35,740 --> 00:34:37,450
And the timing of you showing up...

480
00:34:39,410 --> 00:34:40,953
You know how that happened.

481
00:34:41,037 --> 00:34:44,040
I met Seungho
because of his father's drug abuse

482
00:34:44,665 --> 00:34:47,251
and his cousin Kwon Taeho's case.

483
00:34:50,254 --> 00:34:52,840
I was just as surprised
when we ran into each other.

484
00:34:53,299 --> 00:34:55,510
Maybe all of this
wasn't just a coincidence.

485
00:34:56,135 --> 00:34:58,638
Maybe we were meant to meet again.

486
00:34:58,721 --> 00:35:00,181
Maybe this is our destiny.

487
00:35:00,556 --> 00:35:03,184
I know it's ridiculous,
but I even thought about that.

488
00:35:03,684 --> 00:35:06,604
I'm just as confused
and astounded as you are.

489
00:35:08,314 --> 00:35:10,942
Mr. Jung is kind of...

490
00:35:11,901 --> 00:35:14,320
I'd like to talk about us,
not someone who isn't here.

491
00:35:17,115 --> 00:35:19,784
I'd like to hear your answer
to the question you once asked.

492
00:35:21,202 --> 00:35:22,245
When it comes to work,

493
00:35:23,621 --> 00:35:25,373
what do you think is more important?

494
00:35:26,249 --> 00:35:27,250
Your heart or money?

495
00:35:28,835 --> 00:35:29,877
(IN MANDARIN) Hey.

496
00:35:35,049 --> 00:35:36,384
(IN KOREAN) Here's a new offer.

497
00:35:37,135 --> 00:35:39,929
As Mr. Jung promised,
we want to double the price.

498
00:35:40,555 --> 00:35:41,764
Thirty million per kilogram.

499
00:35:42,431 --> 00:35:44,934
And double the amount, too.

500
00:35:45,935 --> 00:35:47,353
So 16 kilograms per trade.

501
00:35:48,229 --> 00:35:51,858
But it could be risky
to suddenly increase the quantity.

502
00:35:51,941 --> 00:35:53,651
For both us and Japan.

503
00:35:53,860 --> 00:35:55,111
(CHUCKLES SOFTLY)

504
00:35:55,570 --> 00:35:57,738
I need a good reason

505
00:35:57,822 --> 00:35:59,740
to make my father feel better.

506
00:36:03,369 --> 00:36:05,204
Okay. I'll ask the boss about it.

507
00:36:05,580 --> 00:36:06,789
No.

508
00:36:06,873 --> 00:36:08,124
You make the decision.

509
00:36:08,207 --> 00:36:10,042
You said you'd go independent one day.

510
00:36:11,586 --> 00:36:13,796
You asked what's important
when it comes to work.

511
00:36:15,756 --> 00:36:17,091
It's money, of course.

512
00:36:18,634 --> 00:36:20,011
But I like you, Seungho.

513
00:36:21,846 --> 00:36:24,140
So I'll follow my heart this time.

514
00:36:29,562 --> 00:36:31,230
From now on, let's work together.

515
00:36:34,066 --> 00:36:36,903
Okay. I'll be honest with you now.

516
00:36:38,362 --> 00:36:40,239
To be honest, after running into you,

517
00:36:40,781 --> 00:36:43,034
I checked if you had a criminal record.

518
00:36:44,744 --> 00:36:47,121
The murdered man.
Seungho's cousin, Kwon Taeho.

519
00:36:48,372 --> 00:36:49,749
I heard he was your friend.

520
00:36:50,499 --> 00:36:53,294
And the number one suspect,
Jang Kyungchul.

521
00:36:53,836 --> 00:36:55,171
He was missing.

522
00:36:55,254 --> 00:36:57,798
- You used to work with him and...
- (TIRES SCREECH)

523
00:37:05,723 --> 00:37:07,183
So after running into me,

524
00:37:09,018 --> 00:37:10,686
you learned I was the suspect.

525
00:37:12,980 --> 00:37:15,566
Is that why you've been seeing me?
Including today?

526
00:37:15,942 --> 00:37:17,109
No, that's not true.

527
00:37:18,194 --> 00:37:20,029
I know you better than anybody.

528
00:37:20,696 --> 00:37:23,199
I know you're not related to that case.

529
00:37:26,035 --> 00:37:27,370
How can you be so sure?

530
00:37:30,206 --> 00:37:31,916
Even if you are,

531
00:37:33,542 --> 00:37:34,669
I don't care.

532
00:37:38,714 --> 00:37:39,882
I trust you.

533
00:37:42,927 --> 00:37:44,136
I mean it.

534
00:37:46,430 --> 00:37:48,182
When your father passed away,

535
00:37:50,059 --> 00:37:51,978
I shouldn't have let you go like that.

536
00:37:53,187 --> 00:37:55,314
I should've stayed with you
no matter what.

537
00:37:58,109 --> 00:37:59,402
Your dreams...

538
00:38:01,445 --> 00:38:03,572
I'll be by your side until they come true.

539
00:38:04,657 --> 00:38:06,117
Everything I can do as a cop,

540
00:38:07,201 --> 00:38:10,288
all the information I can get,
