00:00:01,835 --> 00:00:08,425
THE CHARACTERS, PLACES, ORGANIZATIONS AND
EVENTS IN THIS DRAMA ARE WORKS OF FICTION

2
00:00:12,637 --> 00:00:13,680
Fucking hell!

3
00:00:23,023 --> 00:00:24,065
Kill them!

4
00:00:24,149 --> 00:00:25,150
Kill them!

5
00:00:25,233 --> 00:00:26,234
What are you doing?

6
00:00:26,317 --> 00:00:27,569
Come on. Kill him!

7
00:00:41,791 --> 00:00:43,084
God damn it!

8
00:00:48,757 --> 00:00:50,717
Check what Jung Gicheul is up to,

9
00:00:51,176 --> 00:00:52,761
where he's going, and with who.

10
00:00:53,011 --> 00:00:55,722
Just tell us about those things
in real time.

11
00:00:58,058 --> 00:00:59,142
Motherfuckers!

12
00:01:13,198 --> 00:01:14,407
You damn son of a bitch.

13
00:01:18,745 --> 00:01:20,413
You motherfuckers!

14
00:01:26,002 --> 00:01:27,003
Fuck!

15
00:01:34,094 --> 00:01:36,012
Hyeok was sent to the ER.

16
00:01:36,096 --> 00:01:37,972
I don't think I can go fishing tomorrow.

17
00:01:38,056 --> 00:01:39,432
You two go without me.

18
00:01:39,516 --> 00:01:40,600
<i>Hi, Boss.</i>

19
00:01:40,683 --> 00:01:42,977
<i>I got a flat tire, so I'm stuck here.</i>

20
00:01:43,061 --> 00:01:44,145
<i>I apologize.</i>

21
00:01:44,479 --> 00:01:45,980
<i>Could you go on ahead first?</i>

22
00:01:49,150 --> 00:01:50,568
What the hell are you doing?

23
00:01:54,197 --> 00:01:55,198
Jung Gicheul.

24
00:01:55,865 --> 00:01:57,700
You son of a bitch!

25
00:01:57,784 --> 00:01:58,910
Fuck!

26
00:02:09,921 --> 00:02:13,258
Do I look like a backstabbing
scumbag to you, you son of a bitch?

27
00:02:21,307 --> 00:02:22,308
Seungho.

28
00:02:28,606 --> 00:02:29,649
Hurry and get in.

29
00:02:29,732 --> 00:02:30,817
You fucker!

30
00:02:45,707 --> 00:02:47,792
God damn it!

31
00:02:48,459 --> 00:02:49,586
Seungho.

32
00:02:49,669 --> 00:02:50,670
Kwon Seungho!

33
00:02:51,629 --> 00:02:53,089
Come on. Wake up.

34
00:02:55,758 --> 00:02:56,885
Seungho, stay with me.

35
00:02:59,470 --> 00:03:00,805
What are you doing? Go now!

36
00:03:08,688 --> 00:03:15,361
THE WORST OF EVIL

37
00:03:17,947 --> 00:03:21,743
OPERATING

38
00:03:23,786 --> 00:03:26,497
- We'll need a lot, so get more ready.
- Yes, Doctor.

39
00:03:26,581 --> 00:03:27,832
- He's bleeding a lot.
- Right.

40
00:03:27,916 --> 00:03:29,542
-So be careful not to touch the wound.
-Okay.

41
00:03:29,626 --> 00:03:30,627
-Gauze.
-Yes, Doctor.

42
00:03:30,710 --> 00:03:37,675
OPERATING

43
00:04:08,331 --> 00:04:10,625
Something happened
on our way to the port.

44
00:04:10,917 --> 00:04:12,293
I'll take full responsibility.

45
00:04:25,056 --> 00:04:27,308
Was it a call from the Chinese, Boss?

46
00:04:27,392 --> 00:04:30,520
Maybe you should call the Japanese too.

47
00:04:32,480 --> 00:04:33,564
Wait outside.

48
00:04:37,277 --> 00:04:38,278
Yes, Boss.

49
00:04:47,996 --> 00:04:48,997
Chief Seo.

50
00:04:49,789 --> 00:04:50,790
Yes, Boss.

51
00:04:54,585 --> 00:04:56,462
You know who knew I was going fishing

52
00:04:57,630 --> 00:04:59,340
other than the three of us, right?

53
00:05:00,758 --> 00:05:02,385
Yes, sir.

54
00:05:02,468 --> 00:05:04,345
Heesung, Jungbae, Kyungjin, and Byungwoo.

55
00:05:06,347 --> 00:05:09,058
Find out which one of them
joined hands with Jaegeon Group.

56
00:05:10,226 --> 00:05:12,353
Right now,
you're the only one I can trust.

57
00:05:14,063 --> 00:05:15,189
Yes, Boss.

58
00:05:27,910 --> 00:05:29,078
Hello, sir.

59
00:05:30,413 --> 00:05:33,750
Have you recently been asked
to handle a Mercedes with a flat tire?

60
00:05:34,876 --> 00:05:36,085
That one.

61
00:05:36,586 --> 00:05:38,463
I went to fix it,

62
00:05:38,546 --> 00:05:41,257
but the guy was so rude
and kept rushing me.

63
00:05:43,593 --> 00:05:44,886
This is the one.

64
00:05:45,386 --> 00:05:47,013
He must drive pretty aggressively.

65
00:05:47,847 --> 00:05:49,349
It's an unusual puncture.

66
00:06:02,070 --> 00:06:03,529
Is Seungho all right?

67
00:06:04,447 --> 00:06:06,074
Is Gicheul still in the hospital?

68
00:06:08,326 --> 00:06:09,494
Yes.

69
00:06:09,577 --> 00:06:12,121
Those fuckers will pay for what they did.

70
00:06:15,625 --> 00:06:16,709
Thanks.

71
00:06:19,545 --> 00:06:22,340
I was at the office
the whole time that day.

72
00:06:22,423 --> 00:06:24,133
I watched a video with him,

73
00:06:24,300 --> 00:06:26,761
and then at night,
we went to his bar and had drinks.

74
00:06:27,637 --> 00:06:29,097
We played pool before that.

75
00:06:29,639 --> 00:06:31,766
Right. We went to a billiard hall too.

76
00:06:48,116 --> 00:06:49,742
Don't move. Stay still.

77
00:06:49,826 --> 00:06:50,827
I'll call the nurse.

78
00:06:53,538 --> 00:06:57,375
Captain Seok is talking
with the doctors there,

79
00:06:57,917 --> 00:07:00,128
-so don't worry too...
-You're so irresponsible.

80
00:07:00,211 --> 00:07:03,381
You knew they were having a turf war
with Song Donghyuk's gang.

81
00:07:03,464 --> 00:07:08,428
But did you really have to
leave Junmo alone in there?

82
00:07:09,887 --> 00:07:11,973
Shouldn't you have taken some measures,

83
00:07:12,056 --> 00:07:14,183
like getting backup
or trying to mediate them?

84
00:07:15,059 --> 00:07:17,437
We can't predict every possible scenario.

85
00:07:18,312 --> 00:07:21,190
It's actually normal
to have unexpected situations arise.

86
00:07:23,568 --> 00:07:26,988
Yet after all that's happened,
you're going to push through with this.

87
00:07:30,241 --> 00:07:32,702
Did meeting with Jung Gicheul
help Junmo...

88
00:07:32,827 --> 00:07:36,330
I mean, did it actually help
with the investigation?

89
00:07:37,373 --> 00:07:39,834
If it did, let me help more actively.

90
00:07:41,085 --> 00:07:44,213
As long as I can get my husband
out without getting him hurt again,

91
00:07:45,047 --> 00:07:47,216
I'll meet Jung Gicheul
and play mind games...

92
00:07:47,300 --> 00:07:49,969
I'll do whatever it takes
to end this crazy operation!

93
00:07:57,643 --> 00:08:00,980
This is the second time
you've saved my life.

94
00:08:04,150 --> 00:08:05,568
I trust you now.

95
00:08:10,990 --> 00:08:12,408
Boss.

96
00:08:13,784 --> 00:08:14,785
In that case,

97
00:08:17,413 --> 00:08:18,998
can I have a cigarette?

98
00:08:27,632 --> 00:08:29,175
<i>We didn't get the product?</i>

99
00:08:29,550 --> 00:08:32,220
No, we didn't even get
to meet the Korean captain.

100
00:08:33,179 --> 00:08:34,680
Any word from them?

101
00:08:34,931 --> 00:08:37,266
No. His phone is turned off.

102
00:08:38,684 --> 00:08:40,978
The payment has been made
in advance, right?

103
00:08:41,062 --> 00:08:42,063
Yes, Boss.

104
00:08:45,816 --> 00:08:47,151
Keep trying to reach them.

105
00:08:47,443 --> 00:08:48,444
Yes, Boss.

106
00:08:50,154 --> 00:08:51,572
About the fishing trip...

107
00:08:52,949 --> 00:08:54,325
Do you actually go fishing?

108
00:08:56,160 --> 00:08:57,537
In the middle of the night?

109
00:08:58,037 --> 00:08:59,914
At least the sailing part, yes.

110
00:09:01,666 --> 00:09:02,667
What for?

111
00:09:07,755 --> 00:09:10,424
Honestly, after all this,
I have the right to know too.

112
00:09:11,342 --> 00:09:13,553
Do you go out to sea
to do some kind of smuggling?

113
00:09:14,011 --> 00:09:15,263
You'll know in time.

114
00:09:24,814 --> 00:09:25,815
Did you find anything?

115
00:09:26,107 --> 00:09:27,275
Not yet, sir.

116
00:09:28,067 --> 00:09:29,527
I think I know who it is though.

117
00:09:30,278 --> 00:09:31,279
Who is it, sir?

118
00:09:32,863 --> 00:09:34,490
Send all the boys back to Seoul

119
00:09:35,575 --> 00:09:38,411
and have everyone assemble
at 9:00 p.m. in the office.

120
00:09:39,078 --> 00:09:40,121
Every one of them.

121
00:09:41,080 --> 00:09:42,123
Yes, Boss.

122
00:09:44,750 --> 00:09:46,377
And before that, be clear to tell everyone

123
00:09:48,212 --> 00:09:50,673
we found out the rat
who sold out our gang to Jaegeon Group.

124
00:09:52,091 --> 00:09:55,011
And I'm going to punish him
in front of everyone.

125
00:09:57,263 --> 00:09:58,264
Yes, Boss.

126
00:10:18,409 --> 00:10:20,828
Have a safe trip.
I'll see you there.

127
00:10:23,205 --> 00:10:27,460
JEIL HOSPITAL

128
00:10:29,045 --> 00:10:31,047
Wait. I have a question.

129
00:10:31,756 --> 00:10:35,676
How are the punks who got shot?

130
00:10:37,845 --> 00:10:40,931
They're all alive, so don't worry.

131
00:10:41,432 --> 00:10:43,059
You better worry about yourself.

132
00:10:52,943 --> 00:10:53,944
Give me the car key.

133
00:11:00,326 --> 00:11:01,369
Boss.

134
00:11:20,054 --> 00:11:22,181
INTERNATIONAL CALL, JAPAN

135
00:11:26,977 --> 00:11:29,230
- Hello?
<i>- You son of a bitch.</i>

136
00:11:29,313 --> 00:11:31,565
<i>How dare you ignore our calls?</i>

137
00:11:31,732 --> 00:11:34,652
Do you think we can't find you
if you just run with our money?

138
00:11:34,777 --> 00:11:35,820
Do you?

139
00:11:49,417 --> 00:11:50,626
It's me.

140
00:11:51,377 --> 00:11:53,045
What happened?

141
00:11:53,129 --> 00:11:54,213
<i>On our way to the sea,</i>

142
00:11:54,422 --> 00:11:56,340
Song Donghyuk's boys ambushed us.

143
00:11:58,509 --> 00:12:00,594
One of our members almost died.

144
00:12:00,678 --> 00:12:01,679
<i>An ambush?</i>

145
00:12:02,012 --> 00:12:04,265
That means those boys knew

146
00:12:04,473 --> 00:12:07,268
<i>which route you took to the sea.</i>

147
00:12:12,940 --> 00:12:16,902
I also just found out
that I'm under surveillance now.

148
00:12:17,153 --> 00:12:20,448
<i>This means there's a rat</i>

149
00:12:20,531 --> 00:12:23,284
<i>running around at your feet right now.</i>

150
00:12:23,951 --> 00:12:25,369
<i>Do you have anything to say?</i>

151
00:12:25,453 --> 00:12:26,454
No.

152
00:12:26,620 --> 00:12:30,958
Anyhow, you'll have to take responsibility
for what happened.

153
00:12:40,593 --> 00:12:41,635
What do we do?

154
00:12:41,719 --> 00:12:42,887
Start the car!

155
00:13:07,244 --> 00:13:09,121
Gosh, seriously.

156
00:13:09,205 --> 00:13:10,206
Hey.

157
00:13:11,332 --> 00:13:12,333
Isn't...

158
00:13:12,416 --> 00:13:14,043
Isn't it cramped in here for you?

159
00:13:14,752 --> 00:13:16,921
You can make yourself
comfortable, you know.

160
00:13:17,213 --> 00:13:20,216
Hey, are you trying to be
like Chow Yun-fat or what?

161
00:13:20,591 --> 00:13:22,593
Wherever you go, there's a war.

162
00:13:23,677 --> 00:13:26,263
But somehow, you never die.

163
00:13:27,181 --> 00:13:28,974
Just like <i>A Better Tomorrow.</i>

164
00:13:37,775 --> 00:13:39,819
Gosh, Chow Yun-fat is so cool.

165
00:13:40,027 --> 00:13:42,822
It would've been perfect
with some matches though.

166
00:13:44,907 --> 00:13:46,909
You must've fought like this too.

167
00:13:47,576 --> 00:13:49,036
So awesome.

168
00:13:55,251 --> 00:13:59,129
JINJONG REST AREA

169
00:14:03,300 --> 00:14:05,094
I'm going to use the restroom.

170
00:14:05,177 --> 00:14:06,262
Okay.

171
00:14:14,645 --> 00:14:16,146
It seems like you need to go too.

172
00:14:17,773 --> 00:14:19,942
I'll make it real quick then.

173
00:14:20,776 --> 00:14:21,902
My stomach.

174
00:14:27,783 --> 00:14:28,993
It hurts!

175
00:14:44,508 --> 00:14:45,926
Junmo.

176
00:14:49,305 --> 00:14:50,306
Are you okay?

177
00:14:50,389 --> 00:14:52,641
I almost fucking died.

178
00:14:53,392 --> 00:14:54,393
I'm sorry.

179
00:14:55,185 --> 00:14:56,186
It's okay.

180
00:14:59,440 --> 00:15:02,860
It seems Jung Gicheul is actually
smuggling when he goes fishing.

181
00:15:03,569 --> 00:15:05,029
And tonight,

182
00:15:05,112 --> 00:15:07,156
he's planning to kill
the traitor in the gang.

183
00:15:07,239 --> 00:15:08,782
We must stop that.

184
00:15:09,283 --> 00:15:11,577
Okay. Take care.

185
00:15:11,660 --> 00:15:12,661
I will.

186
00:15:39,939 --> 00:15:42,399
INCOMING CALL

187
00:15:45,319 --> 00:15:46,320
Hello?

188
00:15:48,572 --> 00:15:50,157
Incheon Port in two days?

189
00:15:52,743 --> 00:15:54,119
They're coming here?

190
00:15:59,541 --> 00:16:00,709
All right.

191
00:16:19,770 --> 00:16:21,605
I'll make it easier for you
to address each other.

192
00:16:21,689 --> 00:16:23,899
Seungho is older than everyone here,

193
00:16:23,983 --> 00:16:25,943
so from now, you'll all call him "Sir."

194
00:16:26,360 --> 00:16:27,361
Okay?

195
00:16:27,444 --> 00:16:28,570
Yes, Boss.

196
00:16:28,696 --> 00:16:30,155
Louder, you bastards.

197
00:16:30,739 --> 00:16:31,865
Yes, Boss.

198
00:16:49,091 --> 00:16:50,759
Do you know who sold out our gang...

199
00:16:54,346 --> 00:16:55,639
to Jaegeon Group?

200
00:17:02,813 --> 00:17:03,814
Nice to meet you.

201
00:17:08,444 --> 00:17:11,780
Even if you turn us down,
somebody will take our offer and join us.

202
00:17:12,740 --> 00:17:14,116
So think wisely.

203
00:17:14,908 --> 00:17:16,076
Take a look around

204
00:17:16,785 --> 00:17:18,495
and see who's not here,

205
00:17:19,329 --> 00:17:20,914
because they didn't want to die.

206
00:17:27,379 --> 00:17:30,007
Kyungjin, Byungwoo, and Chief Seo.

207
00:17:30,090 --> 00:17:31,717
I don't see these three.

208
00:17:40,934 --> 00:17:43,228
Sorry. It was hard getting a taxi.

209
00:17:53,572 --> 00:17:54,782
Who's the traitor?

210
00:17:56,575 --> 00:17:58,494
I don't think it's Heesung or Jungbae.

211
00:17:59,536 --> 00:18:02,581
They're all alive, so don't worry.

212
00:18:03,707 --> 00:18:04,750
Oh Kyungjin.

213
00:18:05,542 --> 00:18:08,337
We should find him and get him out
as soon as possible.

214
00:18:09,505 --> 00:18:12,299
He was the only one who knew about
the situation in Jaegeon Group.

215
00:18:13,175 --> 00:18:14,343
Oh Kyungjin.

216
00:18:21,767 --> 00:18:22,768
Hello?

217
00:18:24,478 --> 00:18:25,729
Kyungjin?

218
00:18:27,064 --> 00:18:28,190
Yes, Boss.

219
00:18:35,906 --> 00:18:36,907
Oh Kyungjin.

220
00:18:39,076 --> 00:18:40,452
Oh Kyungjin!

221
00:18:52,756 --> 00:18:54,007
God damn it.

222
00:18:56,343 --> 00:18:58,428
Fuck.

223
00:19:01,849 --> 00:19:03,517
Fuck...

224
00:19:09,231 --> 00:19:12,693
Kyungjin, why did you do it?

225
00:19:13,110 --> 00:19:15,237
Why would you ask that?

226
00:19:17,072 --> 00:19:19,032
It's fucking embarrassing for me.

227
00:19:24,705 --> 00:19:26,331
Right. Why would it matter?

228
00:19:27,833 --> 00:19:30,085
What matters is
that you caused all this mess.

229
00:19:35,174 --> 00:19:36,466
I want you all to watch closely

230
00:19:36,842 --> 00:19:38,927
and see what happens
when you betray our family.

231
00:19:41,889 --> 00:19:42,890
Chief Seo.

232
00:19:59,406 --> 00:20:00,866
Fuck.

233
00:20:06,872 --> 00:20:07,873
Boss.

234
00:20:07,956 --> 00:20:08,999
Fuck!

235
00:20:09,082 --> 00:20:10,459
What are you going to do now?

236
00:20:12,753 --> 00:20:14,838
That bastard almost got you killed.

237
00:20:21,386 --> 00:20:22,638
And he has to pay for it.

238
00:20:30,479 --> 00:20:31,605
Try to bear it.

239
00:20:32,814 --> 00:20:33,815
Because it'll hurt.

240
00:20:45,118 --> 00:20:47,663
You fucking son of a bitch.

241
00:20:50,624 --> 00:20:51,625
Let's watch a little.

242
00:20:53,460 --> 00:20:56,797
Fucking son of a bitch. You motherfucker.

243
00:20:57,297 --> 00:21:00,509
You motherfucking piece of shit.

244
00:21:01,051 --> 00:21:02,636
Stupid motherfucker.

245
00:21:05,973 --> 00:21:08,058
You fucking son of a bitch.

246
00:21:09,768 --> 00:21:10,769
Fucking piece of shit.

247
00:21:15,399 --> 00:21:18,527
I almost died because of you, fucker.

248
00:21:19,069 --> 00:21:21,571
Get it? Fucking rat.

249
00:21:28,078 --> 00:21:29,079
Boss.

250
00:21:30,497 --> 00:21:33,709
I think that was enough
for almost killing me.

251
00:21:36,586 --> 00:21:37,963
-Hey, Yongdae.
-Yes, sir.

252
00:21:51,852 --> 00:21:53,312
Stay out of my sight.

253
00:21:54,896 --> 00:21:57,232
If I ever see you again,
I'm going to kill you for real.

254
00:22:02,029 --> 00:22:03,989
Heesung, Jungbae, Chief Seo, follow me.

255
00:22:04,072 --> 00:22:05,073
You too, Seungho.

256
00:22:09,578 --> 00:22:11,705
Consider yourself lucky, you bastard.

257
00:22:14,124 --> 00:22:15,208
Clean this up.

258
00:22:15,334 --> 00:22:16,460
Yes, sir.

259
00:22:17,627 --> 00:22:19,087
Throw him out somewhere far away.

260
00:22:19,421 --> 00:22:20,714
Yes, sir.

261
00:22:30,265 --> 00:22:32,476
The Chinese are coming here in two days.

262
00:22:33,769 --> 00:22:34,853
Why, all of a sudden?

263
00:22:37,731 --> 00:22:40,150
Why don't we talk about this
more privately, sir?

264
00:22:40,233 --> 00:22:43,195
No, we need more than just us three now.

265
00:22:46,198 --> 00:22:48,450
You already kind of know
what's going on, right?

266
00:22:50,243 --> 00:22:51,995
I'll deal with them when they come.

267
00:22:52,788 --> 00:22:55,332
So you prepare something
to make them feel better.

268
00:22:55,624 --> 00:22:56,792
Yes, Boss.

269
00:22:57,834 --> 00:22:58,835
And Heesung,

270
00:22:59,503 --> 00:23:01,755
see if Kyungjin's up to
any funny business.

271
00:23:03,048 --> 00:23:04,049
Okay.

272
00:23:04,591 --> 00:23:05,759
Chief Seo, take care of Seungho.

273
00:23:06,718 --> 00:23:07,719
Yes, Boss.

274
00:23:09,096 --> 00:23:10,097
You can go now.

279
00:24:06,653 --> 00:24:08,655
we thoroughly investigated
just the meth cooks.

Yoon Wongil.

282
00:24:15,120 --> 00:24:17,122
Why did you say she went to China again?

283
00:24:17,205 --> 00:24:18,707
For traveling.

284
00:24:19,040 --> 00:24:20,125
Hasn't she returned yet?

285
00:24:20,208 --> 00:24:21,209
No.

286
00:24:22,210 --> 00:24:24,546
Traveling in China for half a year?

287
00:24:29,092 --> 00:24:30,218
Bring the interpreter.

288
00:24:30,302 --> 00:24:31,595
I need to call Mr. Murayama.

289
00:24:31,678 --> 00:24:32,679
Yes, sir.

290
00:24:37,893 --> 00:24:39,311
-Hello, Captain Seok?
<i>-Hello, sir.</i>

291
00:24:39,394 --> 00:24:41,396
Do you know Professor Yoon?

292
00:24:41,480 --> 00:24:42,856
The gray-haired lady.

293
00:24:43,982 --> 00:24:45,525
I got a big one.

294
00:24:45,609 --> 00:24:48,236
This trade might not be
just between Korea and Japan

295
00:24:48,320 --> 00:24:50,989
but among Korea, China, and Japan.

296
00:24:51,740 --> 00:24:54,367
So the Chinese are
our suspects as well now.

297
00:24:55,285 --> 00:24:59,122
<i>If Detective Park joins</i>
<i>tomorrow's meeting with the Chinese,</i>

298
00:24:59,206 --> 00:25:01,374
<i>we'll be more sure</i>
<i>about this theory though.</i>

299
00:25:02,042 --> 00:25:03,460

Hello?

303
00:25:36,910 --> 00:25:38,537
Hi, Gicheul. It's me, Euijeong.

304
00:25:40,747 --> 00:25:41,748
Hi, Euijeong.

305
00:25:42,290 --> 00:25:44,000
<i>I should've called you.</i>

306
00:25:44,167 --> 00:25:46,503
<i>How are you? Are you okay?</i>

307
00:25:46,711 --> 00:25:48,046
I'm fine, thanks to you.

308
00:25:50,632 --> 00:25:52,968
Thank you so much
for coming to the funeral.

309
00:25:53,051 --> 00:25:55,428
No need to thank me.
I just did what I had to do.

310
00:25:55,845 --> 00:25:57,389
Speaking of which,

311
00:25:57,472 --> 00:25:58,848
are you free tomorrow?

312
00:25:58,974 --> 00:26:00,100
Tomorrow?

313
00:26:00,559 --> 00:26:03,019
Yeah, tomorrow is the only day I'm free.

314
00:26:03,353 --> 00:26:04,604
<i>Can we meet?</i>

315
00:26:10,777 --> 00:26:13,280
Yes, we can. Let's meet tomorrow.

316
00:26:14,739 --> 00:26:16,199
Please tell Seungho

317
00:26:17,325 --> 00:26:19,661
that I appreciate him visiting too.

318
00:26:20,537 --> 00:26:21,538
<i>I will.</i>

319
00:26:41,349 --> 00:26:43,268
I have an urgent appointment tomorrow.

320
00:26:43,351 --> 00:26:45,312
So you go deal with the Chinese.

321
00:26:47,606 --> 00:26:48,607
What happened?

322
00:26:51,151 --> 00:26:52,152
Yes, Boss.

323
00:26:54,571 --> 00:26:56,072
Did you look into any hospitals?

324
00:26:56,906 --> 00:26:57,907
Boss.

325
00:26:58,617 --> 00:27:01,286
Can I get back to you on that
with Chief Seo?

326
00:27:04,706 --> 00:27:05,874
Finish eating first.

327
00:27:06,291 --> 00:27:07,292
Yes, Boss.

328
00:27:10,712 --> 00:27:11,755
Heesung.

329
00:27:12,631 --> 00:27:13,798
What did you name your baby?

330
00:27:15,133 --> 00:27:16,176
Jaeyoung.

331
00:27:17,344 --> 00:27:18,386
Hong Jaeyoung.

332
00:27:19,012 --> 00:27:20,221
That's a great name.

333
00:27:20,305 --> 00:27:21,306
I'll visit sometime.

334
00:27:21,556 --> 00:27:23,016
Sure. The baby's so cute.

335
00:27:23,099 --> 00:27:24,726
Doesn't look like me at all.

336
00:27:25,560 --> 00:27:27,020
The baby looks like Hyeok.

337
00:27:29,773 --> 00:27:31,608
What did you want to say in private?

338
00:27:32,400 --> 00:27:33,652
Chief Seo.

339
00:27:34,319 --> 00:27:37,822
You've looked into
Oh Kyungjin's whereabouts that day, right?

340
00:27:38,323 --> 00:27:39,324
Of course, I have.

341
00:27:39,616 --> 00:27:40,617
I just wonder

342
00:27:41,785 --> 00:27:43,912
how he located our car

343
00:27:43,995 --> 00:27:45,372
and told them about it.

344
00:27:46,206 --> 00:27:50,085
It's not like he followed our car.

345
00:27:51,169 --> 00:27:53,338
Jungbae is the one
who followed us that day.

346
00:27:55,423 --> 00:27:56,925
Are you suspecting Jungbae?

347
00:28:00,720 --> 00:28:02,138
Do you agree, Chief Seo?

348
00:28:02,430 --> 00:28:05,141
Yes, I have the same suspicion.

349
00:28:05,850 --> 00:28:06,851
Boss.

350
00:28:14,067 --> 00:28:15,777
Let's do one last check.

351
00:28:17,654 --> 00:28:18,655
Boss.

352
00:28:19,406 --> 00:28:21,408
Our guests from China

353
00:28:21,491 --> 00:28:23,952
sound like important people
to your business.

354
00:28:25,954 --> 00:28:29,666
How about we send Seungho there
while I check on Jungbae?

355
00:28:31,126 --> 00:28:32,585
I think you should be careful

356
00:28:32,669 --> 00:28:35,380
until we're sure
about Jungbae and Heesung.

357
00:28:45,390 --> 00:28:47,308
Jungbae is like a little brother to me.

358
00:28:49,227 --> 00:28:50,437
Make sure to do it perfectly.

359
00:28:52,939 --> 00:28:53,940
Yes, Boss.

360
00:28:56,317 --> 00:28:57,360
Chief Seo.

361
00:29:05,994 --> 00:29:07,829
You can go now. Make sure it's done right.

362
00:29:07,912 --> 00:29:08,913
Yes, Boss.

363
00:29:24,596 --> 00:29:25,597
Hello, Boss.

364
00:29:26,055 --> 00:29:28,808
You have information
on all of my employees, right?

365
00:29:29,184 --> 00:29:30,435
Yes, I do.

366
00:29:30,852 --> 00:29:32,896
I'll need to do some background checks.

367
00:29:42,947 --> 00:29:44,491
If things go well,

368
00:29:44,574 --> 00:29:47,035
it might be out with the old,
in with the new.

369
00:29:56,628 --> 00:29:58,087
Did you call for me, Boss?

370
00:29:58,171 --> 00:29:59,714
Did you buy gifts for the Chinese?

371
00:30:00,131 --> 00:30:02,175
Yes, I got something expensive ready.

372
00:30:03,343 --> 00:30:04,344
Good job.

373
00:30:05,428 --> 00:30:06,554
Thank you, Boss.

374
00:30:11,726 --> 00:30:12,727
So...

375
00:30:14,479 --> 00:30:15,730
I feel like getting a drink,

376
00:30:17,023 --> 00:30:19,442
but I don't want to drink alone.

377
00:30:21,861 --> 00:30:23,738
Right.

378
00:30:25,031 --> 00:30:27,867
Great. I was going to grab a drink too.

379
00:30:28,576 --> 00:30:31,496
Should I get the drinks ready outside?

380
00:30:32,997 --> 00:30:34,123
Sounds good.

381
00:30:34,207 --> 00:30:35,208
Okay, sir.

382
00:30:41,381 --> 00:30:43,299
DAILY PATROL JOURNAL

383
00:31:14,998 --> 00:31:15,999
Sir.

384
00:31:17,292 --> 00:31:18,293
Sir?

385
00:31:22,839 --> 00:31:24,090
It's only a simple interview.

386
00:31:24,173 --> 00:31:27,218
You can just nod to answer my questions.

387
00:31:29,596 --> 00:31:32,015
We got stuck here in our investigation.

388
00:31:32,682 --> 00:31:36,060
How did you know which route
Jung Gicheul was taking that day?

389
00:31:37,270 --> 00:31:39,898
Did somebody tail his car
and tell you about it?

390
00:31:43,318 --> 00:31:44,527
Then, how did you know?

391
00:31:48,489 --> 00:31:50,700
Did your gang tail his car

392
00:31:50,783 --> 00:31:52,577
all the way from Seoul?

393
00:31:58,333 --> 00:32:00,168
With the car you were riding in?

394
00:32:10,887 --> 00:32:11,888
But sir...

395
00:32:15,475 --> 00:32:17,352
I know you've been shot,

396
00:32:18,603 --> 00:32:20,605
but how could you not recognize my face?

397
00:32:36,454 --> 00:32:37,830
It's me, Seo Jongryeol.

398
00:32:42,710 --> 00:32:44,545
It's so nice to talk with you alone

399
00:32:44,629 --> 00:32:45,797
without the other boys.

400
00:32:47,548 --> 00:32:49,133
It's been a while.

401
00:32:49,842 --> 00:32:50,843
Please.

402
00:32:52,178 --> 00:32:53,221
Right.

403
00:32:53,304 --> 00:32:55,014
I'll send Kwon Seungho

404
00:32:55,098 --> 00:32:56,808
to Incheon Port tomorrow morning.

405
00:32:57,100 --> 00:32:58,559
You just rest up.

406
00:33:00,019 --> 00:33:02,772
Yes, Boss.

407
00:33:22,875 --> 00:33:24,085
That's life.

408
00:33:27,588 --> 00:33:29,799
What goes around comes around.

409
00:33:31,259 --> 00:33:32,343
Think of it that way.

410
00:33:33,761 --> 00:33:34,762
And think of this

411
00:33:38,307 --> 00:33:39,976
as falling into a peaceful sleep.

412
00:34:02,165 --> 00:34:05,293
Since you brought it up...

413
00:34:05,960 --> 00:34:06,961
So...

414
00:34:09,922 --> 00:34:11,007
Just in case...

415
00:34:12,383 --> 00:34:13,593
Just to be sure,

416
00:34:14,969 --> 00:34:21,601
you didn't suspect me or Heesung, right?

417
00:34:24,854 --> 00:34:26,230
What are you talking about?

418
00:34:26,564 --> 00:34:27,690
Right.

419
00:34:27,774 --> 00:34:29,192
Sorry. Just forget it, Boss.

420
00:35:00,515 --> 00:35:01,516
Hello?

421
00:35:01,599 --> 00:35:02,809
<i>Boss, this is Jongryeol.</i>

422
00:35:03,601 --> 00:35:05,061
<i>As you instructed,</i>

423
00:35:05,186 --> 00:35:06,521
<i>I took care of Kang Geon.</i>

424
00:35:07,396 --> 00:35:08,564
<i>As for Heesung and Jungbae...</i>

425
00:35:11,275 --> 00:35:12,360
<i>they're clean.</i>

426
00:35:13,653 --> 00:35:15,822
Well done. You can go rest now.

427
00:35:19,534 --> 00:35:21,410
Who was it on the phone, Boss?

428
00:35:22,995 --> 00:35:23,996
Nobody.

429
00:35:26,582 --> 00:35:27,583
Cheers.

430
00:35:36,968 --> 00:35:38,177
If you think about it...

431
00:35:38,261 --> 00:35:39,303
Yes, Boss?

432
00:35:40,012 --> 00:35:43,808
You and I.
We've always been together, right?

433
00:35:44,767 --> 00:35:48,646
Why are you stating the obvious, Boss?

434
00:35:50,439 --> 00:35:54,318
The son of the stationery store owner
in front of school, Choi Jungbae.

435
00:35:54,443 --> 00:35:59,490
Why are you talking about the old days?
It's so awkward.

436
00:35:59,574 --> 00:36:01,617
Are you drunk?

437
00:36:02,368 --> 00:36:03,619
The only student

438
00:36:04,996 --> 00:36:06,122
in Yeoksam High

439
00:36:06,289 --> 00:36:08,207
who lived in a studio apartment was you.

440
00:36:09,584 --> 00:36:12,128
And I was the only one
who lived in a semi-basement.

441
00:36:13,045 --> 00:36:14,881
The poor ones.

442
00:36:22,597 --> 00:36:25,391
Since it's just the two of us here,

443
00:36:26,475 --> 00:36:31,522
are you not meeting
with the Chinese yourself

444
00:36:32,481 --> 00:36:34,609
because of something important?

445
00:36:36,277 --> 00:36:37,361
It's nothing.

446
00:36:39,530 --> 00:36:42,408
Boss, as you said,

447
00:36:43,284 --> 00:36:46,913
I've been tagging along
with you all my life.

448
00:36:47,288 --> 00:36:49,665
And now, I can read your mind quite well.

449
00:36:50,666 --> 00:36:52,418
Is it because of that girl, Yu Euijeong?

450
00:36:57,924 --> 00:36:59,675
-Jungbae.
-Yes, Boss?

451
00:37:01,385 --> 00:37:03,346
If you can read my mind,

452
00:37:04,680 --> 00:37:06,641
you should know how
to look the other way too.

453
00:37:11,896 --> 00:37:16,108
You're right.
But it just doesn't make sense.

454
00:37:16,984 --> 00:37:20,655
It's not like you can marry a cop.

455
00:37:22,365 --> 00:37:23,491
I can't?

456
00:37:24,909 --> 00:37:26,035
Pardon?

457
00:37:26,327 --> 00:37:27,536
Can't I marry her?

458
00:37:30,039 --> 00:37:31,415
Gosh.

459
00:37:34,460 --> 00:37:38,130
To be perfectly honest,
I'm a little scared.

460
00:37:39,507 --> 00:37:41,759
What if something bad happens
because of her?

461
00:37:42,218 --> 00:37:44,178
I just want you to keep in mind

462
00:37:44,804 --> 00:37:49,433
that you're about to start
something really dangerous.

463
00:37:55,564 --> 00:37:57,149
Well, some things are dangerous

464
00:37:59,110 --> 00:38:00,611
but worth trying, right?

465
00:38:03,739 --> 00:38:04,740
Right.

466
00:38:06,033 --> 00:38:07,034
True.

467
00:38:08,202 --> 00:38:09,495
Let's drink.

468
00:38:45,823 --> 00:38:47,783
Oh, hey.

469
00:38:58,586 --> 00:38:59,837
How have you been?

470
00:39:23,194 --> 00:39:24,195
Choi Jungbae.

471
00:39:25,780 --> 00:39:26,781
Yes, sir?

472
00:39:28,699 --> 00:39:29,700
Do you trust me?

473
00:39:37,249 --> 00:39:38,417
I trust you. I mean it.

474
00:39:42,046 --> 00:39:43,506
I trust you too.

475
00:39:44,048 --> 00:39:46,342
Jung Gicheul has started to trust me.

476
00:39:46,717 --> 00:39:48,677
From now on, whenever I get free time...

477
00:39:48,761 --> 00:39:52,139
Stop. Let's not talk about that now.

478
00:39:54,767 --> 00:39:56,936
I don't want to think about those things.

479
00:39:58,854 --> 00:39:59,855
Okay.

480
00:40:01,190 --> 00:40:02,691
I just want to think about us.

481
00:40:04,276 --> 00:40:05,569
Right.

482
00:40:08,364 --> 00:40:09,365
Your mother.

483
00:40:11,492 --> 00:40:12,827
Did the funeral go well?

484
00:40:18,207 --> 00:40:19,333
I'm sorry.

485
00:40:23,587 --> 00:40:24,713
How's your wound?

486
00:40:26,632 --> 00:40:27,675
Are you okay now?

487
00:40:29,427 --> 00:40:30,886
Yes, I'm okay.

488
00:40:34,014 --> 00:40:35,516
Eat up.

489
00:40:53,200 --> 00:40:55,327
You asshole.

490
00:40:58,914 --> 00:41:01,167
You're distracting me, you asshole.

491
00:41:01,459 --> 00:41:04,003
Think about it.

492
00:41:08,132 --> 00:41:13,846
Don't you think Gicheul is trusting
Seungho too much?

493
00:41:15,181 --> 00:41:16,182
What is it now?

494
00:41:16,265 --> 00:41:18,225
It kind of bothers me
that he's sending him

495
00:41:18,309 --> 00:41:20,936
to that important meeting and not us.

496
00:41:23,147 --> 00:41:25,065
You got some free time thanks to that.

497
00:41:28,402 --> 00:41:30,446
When he said "an urgent appointment,"

498
00:41:30,529 --> 00:41:32,656
he meant a date with the cop, right?

499
00:41:36,744 --> 00:41:38,787
Well, that kind of bothers me too.

500
00:41:38,871 --> 00:41:39,914
Right?

501
00:41:41,540 --> 00:41:43,709
Whatever. It's his fucking business.

502
00:41:45,377 --> 00:41:46,795
Let's mind our own.

503
00:41:55,304 --> 00:41:59,058
<i>Yoon Wongil. An ex-convict</i>
<i>jailed for meth who went over to China.</i>

504
00:41:59,975 --> 00:42:03,395
<i>Please check if this Chinese guest is her.</i>

505
00:42:04,188 --> 00:42:08,442
INCHEON COASTAL PASSENGER TERMINAL

506
00:42:19,370 --> 00:42:21,247
<i>Dear passengers...</i>

507
00:42:32,550 --> 00:42:33,592
Are you Mr. Jung's man?

508
00:42:34,176 --> 00:42:36,387
Yes, I am.

509
00:42:41,934 --> 00:42:42,935
Let's go.

510
00:42:58,367 --> 00:42:59,827
I said we should go somewhere nice.

511
00:43:01,203 --> 00:43:03,539
I wanted to visit the church.
It's been a while.

512
00:43:03,872 --> 00:43:05,165
Is that okay with you?

513
00:43:05,249 --> 00:43:07,418
Of course, it is.

514
00:43:14,967 --> 00:43:15,968
Oh.

515
00:43:20,097 --> 00:43:21,515
It would be nice

516
00:43:21,974 --> 00:43:24,476
if your mother started
to attend church again.

517
00:43:44,788 --> 00:43:46,248
As far as I know,

518
00:43:46,874 --> 00:43:48,208
if you're from China,

519
00:43:48,334 --> 00:43:51,128
only Korean-Chinese
who are over 55 can enter Korea.

520
00:43:51,211 --> 00:43:54,381
So I didn't expect
to see someone so young.

521
00:43:59,470 --> 00:44:01,472
We don't do this kind of job unprepared.

522
00:44:02,806 --> 00:44:04,350
I didn't know you were Korean.

523
00:44:06,477 --> 00:44:08,020
No, you're right. I'm Korean-Chinese.

524
00:44:10,648 --> 00:44:13,525
I didn't know Mr. Jung would send
someone so innocent.

525
00:44:22,826 --> 00:44:26,205
Is the person you came with taking a taxi?

526
00:44:37,675 --> 00:44:39,551
And about the recent mishap...

527
00:44:39,635 --> 00:44:41,053
Let me apologize first.

528
00:44:41,929 --> 00:44:42,930
We are very sorry.

529
00:44:49,770 --> 00:44:50,813
Is it a Korean thing

530
00:44:52,189 --> 00:44:54,191
to have other people apologize for you?

531
00:44:59,196 --> 00:45:00,948
One makes a mistake,

532
00:45:02,074 --> 00:45:03,450
and someone else apologizes.

533
00:45:28,350 --> 00:45:29,518
How interesting.

534
00:45:55,169 --> 00:45:56,378
Please get some rest.

535
00:45:57,212 --> 00:45:58,255
Your name?

536
00:45:58,338 --> 00:45:59,798
I'm Kwon Seungho.

537
00:46:33,332 --> 00:46:35,250
They're Korean-Chinese.

538
00:46:35,375 --> 00:46:38,587
Their passports must be forged,
so there's no point in background checks.

539
00:46:39,213 --> 00:46:41,965
I wonder why they came to Korea.

540
00:46:43,091 --> 00:46:45,427
To deliver the stuff on land
since they couldn't on water?

541
00:46:46,178 --> 00:46:49,014
Customs clearance at Incheon
wouldn't be that easy to pass.

542
00:46:50,015 --> 00:46:51,183
It must be something else.

543
00:46:51,266 --> 00:46:52,518
So let's watch them for now.

544
00:46:52,601 --> 00:46:54,436
What are you doing here, by the way?

545
00:46:55,854 --> 00:46:57,648
Shouldn't you be with Jung Gicheul now?

546
00:46:57,731 --> 00:46:58,982
Let me take care of this.

547
00:47:01,151 --> 00:47:02,736
Jung Gicheul is

548
00:47:02,820 --> 00:47:04,404
with Inspector Yu now.

549
00:47:04,863 --> 00:47:07,699
Why is Euijeong meeting with him?

550
00:47:07,783 --> 00:47:10,994
Didn't you see what that bastard did
to her at the funeral?

551
00:47:11,245 --> 00:47:13,914
Since you got hurt,
she decided to continue helping us.

552
00:47:14,122 --> 00:47:15,207
So why...

553
00:47:16,208 --> 00:47:19,086
Why is Euijeong helping us now?

554
00:47:20,003 --> 00:47:22,256
God damn it, before deciding
something like that,

555
00:47:22,339 --> 00:47:24,341
shouldn't you have
at least asked me first?

556
00:47:24,675 --> 00:47:27,177
Things were urgent,
and we couldn't reach out.

557
00:47:27,261 --> 00:47:29,096
We couldn't just sit back and watch.

558
00:47:29,263 --> 00:47:31,932
-Inspector Yu must've felt the same.
-God damn it.

559
00:47:32,015 --> 00:47:35,310
She insisted she'd do
anything it took to help you.

560
00:47:39,314 --> 00:47:40,941
You trust her, don't you?

561
00:47:41,149 --> 00:47:42,609
Don't think too much into it.

562
00:47:43,443 --> 00:47:46,488
Thanks to her,
these potential Chinese drug producers

563
00:47:46,572 --> 00:47:47,906
are right before our eyes now.

564
00:47:47,990 --> 00:47:49,032
God damn it.

565
00:47:58,917 --> 00:47:59,960
Excuse me.
