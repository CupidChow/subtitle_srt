00:00:01,751 --> 00:00:08,717
THE CHARACTERS, PLACES, ORGANIZATIONS AND
EVENTS IN THIS DRAMA ARE WORKS OF FICTION

2
00:00:13,972 --> 00:00:16,016
You must be very busy, Mr. Jung.

3
00:00:20,228 --> 00:00:22,647
I went to the trouble of sailing
all the way here,

4
00:00:24,566 --> 00:00:26,860
and I'm not even sure if I can meet you.

5
00:00:27,736 --> 00:00:29,571
I'll come right over to you.

6
00:00:31,614 --> 00:00:34,075
I'll see you at the bar
on the first floor.

7
00:00:34,159 --> 00:00:36,369
Also, my man is in the lobby,

8
00:00:36,453 --> 00:00:38,705
so feel free to ask him
if you need anything.

9
00:00:40,790 --> 00:00:41,791
Okay, bye.

10
00:00:47,380 --> 00:00:48,381
I'm sorry.

11
00:00:48,798 --> 00:00:50,508
Isn't this place too fancy?

12
00:00:50,592 --> 00:00:52,677
Good food will give you energy.

13
00:00:52,761 --> 00:00:55,513
I'm sure your mother wants you
to feel better soon too.

14
00:00:55,597 --> 00:00:57,474
Let's not talk about that.

15
00:00:57,891 --> 00:00:58,933
Euijeong.

16
00:00:59,684 --> 00:01:00,727
When we were young,

17
00:01:02,020 --> 00:01:04,189
I ran away without saying anything.

18
00:01:04,272 --> 00:01:05,273
I'm sorry.

19
00:01:06,149 --> 00:01:07,150
Why did you do that?

20
00:01:07,400 --> 00:01:08,985
I didn't want to trouble you.

21
00:01:10,904 --> 00:01:14,032
The whole neighborhood
would've denounced us as murderers.

22
00:01:18,286 --> 00:01:20,747
Remember the dream
I talked about back then?

23
00:01:21,081 --> 00:01:22,082
Kind of.

24
00:01:22,165 --> 00:01:23,666
I've nearly realized it, right?

25
00:01:24,793 --> 00:01:27,045
How many businesses do you own again?

26
00:01:27,670 --> 00:01:32,383
Well, most of them are run
by my employees.

27
00:01:32,926 --> 00:01:34,010
If you combine them...

28
00:01:36,304 --> 00:01:37,430
A lot.

29
00:01:37,514 --> 00:01:39,891
How were you able to open
all of those businesses?

30
00:01:40,683 --> 00:01:43,019
You seemed to be working
with your old friends.

31
00:01:43,103 --> 00:01:44,479
Are they business partners?

32
00:01:44,562 --> 00:01:46,272
Or are they your employees?

33
00:01:46,356 --> 00:01:48,066
You have a lot of questions.

34
00:01:50,276 --> 00:01:54,197
I'm just curious how your life has been.

35
00:01:56,366 --> 00:01:58,034
I've been curious about you too.

36
00:01:58,910 --> 00:02:00,286
So your dream came true?

37
00:02:02,455 --> 00:02:03,915
I should keep my promise now.

38
00:02:05,291 --> 00:02:06,292
What promise?

39
00:02:44,247 --> 00:02:45,248
What's your dream?

40
00:02:45,665 --> 00:02:46,666
My dream?

41
00:02:47,625 --> 00:02:48,626
Being a nightclub owner?

42
00:02:49,836 --> 00:02:52,046
That's the most specific dream I've heard.

43
00:02:52,130 --> 00:02:54,090
Well, not just a nightclub.

44
00:02:54,174 --> 00:02:57,427
I want to open a restaurant and a cafe
next to the nightclub.

45
00:02:57,510 --> 00:03:01,181
And a movie theater, a Chinese restaurant,
a bar, and a Korean restaurant.

46
00:03:01,639 --> 00:03:05,059
So if anyone visits Gangnam,
they have to visit one of my stores.

47
00:03:05,143 --> 00:03:06,811
Then, nobody will look down on me.

48
00:03:08,146 --> 00:03:10,899
So like an "emperor of the night"?

49
00:03:11,441 --> 00:03:12,942
Emperor?

50
00:03:13,026 --> 00:03:14,444
I like that.

51
00:03:14,944 --> 00:03:16,738
If I become famous like that,

52
00:03:16,821 --> 00:03:19,699
I won't have to go
to a prestigious university to marry you.

53
00:03:20,700 --> 00:03:21,784
What are you saying?

54
00:03:22,785 --> 00:03:24,370
I'll have to become an emperor.

55
00:03:24,454 --> 00:03:27,040
I'll become an emperor and marry you.

56
00:03:27,582 --> 00:03:28,708
I promise.

57
00:03:38,968 --> 00:03:44,933
THE WORST OF EVIL

58
00:04:00,949 --> 00:04:02,075
Where are the Chinese?

59
00:04:02,367 --> 00:04:03,451
They're upstairs now.

60
00:04:04,202 --> 00:04:05,203
Any issues?

61
00:04:05,495 --> 00:04:06,496
No, Boss.

62
00:04:08,414 --> 00:04:09,624
Did you go somewhere, sir?

63
00:04:12,627 --> 00:04:14,045
Hello, Jung Gicheul speaking.

64
00:04:14,712 --> 00:04:15,713
I've arrived.

65
00:04:42,365 --> 00:04:43,992
Thank you for coming all this way.

66
00:04:45,243 --> 00:04:46,953
You can use this during your stay.

67
00:04:50,999 --> 00:04:52,667
Are you fucking serious?

68
00:05:17,233 --> 00:05:18,234
What's this?

69
00:05:18,609 --> 00:05:19,610
A gift for you.

70
00:05:27,243 --> 00:05:29,078
Professor Yoon was wearing this watch too.

71
00:05:30,455 --> 00:05:32,957
Is this how you handle things?

72
00:05:40,340 --> 00:05:41,341
Man...

73
00:05:41,424 --> 00:05:43,343
You don't even have a fucking lighter?

74
00:05:44,093 --> 00:05:45,094
Hey.

75
00:05:51,059 --> 00:05:53,811
Considering all the loss we've incurred,

76
00:05:54,145 --> 00:05:56,481
from arranging the boat and sailors...

77
00:05:59,108 --> 00:06:01,277
Don't you at least owe me
a clock made of gold?

78
00:06:05,907 --> 00:06:07,241
I'll apologize once again.

79
00:06:07,325 --> 00:06:08,368
I'm sorry.

80
00:06:08,451 --> 00:06:09,827
It won't happen again.

81
00:06:11,579 --> 00:06:14,832
I should only work with those
who I can trust.

82
00:06:18,086 --> 00:06:19,962
That's what my father always said.

83
00:06:21,255 --> 00:06:23,549
If you continue to trade
with us like before,

84
00:06:24,467 --> 00:06:26,594
that trust will naturally be built again.

85
00:06:26,677 --> 00:06:29,097
Trust will naturally be built again?

86
00:06:30,473 --> 00:06:32,809
As they say here,

87
00:06:33,810 --> 00:06:35,103
dream on, Mr. Jung.

88
00:06:39,273 --> 00:06:40,650
What more can I do for you?

89
00:06:44,112 --> 00:06:47,490
Those Japanese must have
a lot of connections.

90
00:06:49,242 --> 00:06:52,120
I don't know how they did it,
but they called my father.

91
00:06:54,664 --> 00:06:56,916
They suggested
the three of us meet in Korea.

92
00:06:57,333 --> 00:06:58,459
That's why I'm here.

93
00:07:01,129 --> 00:07:04,715
But why meet in person
when we can talk on the phone?

94
00:07:06,509 --> 00:07:08,010
I think I know why.

95
00:07:11,931 --> 00:07:13,599
I'm tired. I'll get going.

96
00:07:15,768 --> 00:07:16,936
Haeryun.

97
00:07:19,439 --> 00:07:20,857
We want to raise our imports

98
00:07:21,566 --> 00:07:22,817
from 8kg to 10kg.

99
00:07:23,860 --> 00:07:27,613
We'll pay for the extra fee, not Japan.

100
00:07:32,910 --> 00:07:35,997
You've become very generous
after hearing the Japanese are coming,

101
00:07:36,080 --> 00:07:37,081
Mr. Jung.

102
00:07:44,630 --> 00:07:46,591
It's too little, too late.

103
00:07:59,729 --> 00:08:01,022
- <i>This is Oyama.</i>
- Hello.

104
00:08:01,439 --> 00:08:03,900
<i>Meet me at 2:00 p.m. tomorrow.</i>

105
00:08:04,317 --> 00:08:05,443
Are you in Korea now?

106
00:08:07,195 --> 00:08:08,571
Did Father come too?

107
00:08:09,280 --> 00:08:11,782
<i>I'll tell you the location tomorrow.</i>

108
00:08:20,166 --> 00:08:23,002
Mr. Murayama from Japan called me.

109
00:08:23,085 --> 00:08:27,798
He said one of the higher-ups
from Yoshioka-gumi's Yokohama branch

110
00:08:27,882 --> 00:08:30,593
is headed to Korea.

111
00:08:30,676 --> 00:08:32,762
His name is Oyama Tsuyoshi.

112
00:08:33,471 --> 00:08:35,932
He's also staying
at Grand Plaza Hotel in Gangnam

113
00:08:36,015 --> 00:08:37,850
like the Chinese.

114
00:08:38,559 --> 00:08:39,936
He's in Room 608.

115
00:08:40,394 --> 00:08:41,395
And the Chinese?

116
00:08:41,479 --> 00:08:43,564
Room 850 and 851.

117
00:08:43,648 --> 00:08:46,150
Maybe they're coming to discuss the attack

118
00:08:46,234 --> 00:08:47,985
that interrupted their trade.

119
00:08:50,071 --> 00:08:52,865
It'd be great if we could bug
all the hotel rooms.

120
00:08:52,949 --> 00:08:54,951
We can request the warrant later.

121
00:08:55,368 --> 00:08:59,247
The detectives and I will monitor
the CCTVs in the hotel corridors.

122
00:08:59,330 --> 00:09:02,917
Once we see them gather
in the same room or move somewhere,

123
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:05,002
we'll start bugging each room.

124
00:09:05,294 --> 00:09:08,422
If Jung Gicheul meets them,

125
00:09:08,506 --> 00:09:11,008
it'd be perfect
if Detective Park can be there too.

126
00:09:11,092 --> 00:09:12,718
If that happens...

127
00:09:13,469 --> 00:09:15,012
Here.

128
00:09:15,096 --> 00:09:17,515
This bug can cover a 1km radius.

129
00:09:18,266 --> 00:09:20,434
Detective Park will be wearing this.

130
00:09:20,518 --> 00:09:22,645
I'll monitor the situation around him

131
00:09:22,770 --> 00:09:24,355
and record in real-time.

132
00:09:24,438 --> 00:09:25,439
Are we done now?

133
00:09:26,983 --> 00:09:28,276
I'll get going then.

134
00:09:29,485 --> 00:09:31,112
A triangle made of three countries.

135
00:09:31,779 --> 00:09:33,281
An international drug cartel!

136
00:09:35,408 --> 00:09:37,410
By the way, Mr. Cho,

137
00:09:39,245 --> 00:09:44,041
when can Inspector Yu stop
meeting with Jung Gicheul?

138
00:09:44,959 --> 00:09:48,588
Well, we don't want to do this either.

139
00:09:48,671 --> 00:09:51,757
But we can't just let her
disappear all of a sudden.

140
00:09:52,216 --> 00:09:55,428
Let's arrest them all
with all the evidence we collect this time

141
00:09:55,511 --> 00:09:56,887
and wrap this up quickly.

142
00:10:02,143 --> 00:10:05,271
GANGNAM POLICE STATION

143
00:10:15,990 --> 00:10:17,366
The name of the missing person?

144
00:10:17,450 --> 00:10:18,743
Cho Janghyun.

145
00:10:19,744 --> 00:10:21,996
But people call him Manager Cho.

146
00:10:22,079 --> 00:10:23,581
Manager of which company?

147
00:10:25,416 --> 00:10:26,584
Which was it?

148
00:10:27,627 --> 00:10:28,753
Our company.

149
00:10:34,634 --> 00:10:36,302
When did you lose touch with him?

150
00:10:37,470 --> 00:10:38,596
-Well...
-So...

151
00:10:39,764 --> 00:10:42,266
That's not what happened.

152
00:10:42,350 --> 00:10:44,101
Was it last Monday?

153
00:10:44,727 --> 00:10:45,728
I don't know.

154
00:10:45,811 --> 00:10:47,521
Last Monday,

155
00:10:47,605 --> 00:10:50,566
he got kidnapped before our eyes.

156
00:10:50,650 --> 00:10:51,942
This is so frustrating.

157
00:10:52,026 --> 00:10:53,027
Kidnapped?

158
00:10:58,949 --> 00:11:00,159
Manager Cho, the drug dealer?

159
00:11:00,409 --> 00:11:01,410
-Yes.
-Yes.

160
00:11:04,413 --> 00:11:06,082
-Roll up your sleeves.
-What?

161
00:11:06,165 --> 00:11:07,291
Come on. Roll them up.

162
00:11:08,959 --> 00:11:11,003
Why is your arm so dirty?

163
00:11:11,379 --> 00:11:13,047
So you are Manager Cho's lackeys.

164
00:11:13,130 --> 00:11:14,131
Sorry?

165
00:11:16,384 --> 00:11:17,593
So Manager Cho...

166
00:11:19,470 --> 00:11:20,513
has been kidnapped?

167
00:11:22,890 --> 00:11:25,101
There's this thing called Gangnam Crystal.

168
00:11:25,184 --> 00:11:28,688
<i>It's a type of meth</i>
<i>that's popular these days.</i>

169
00:11:28,771 --> 00:11:30,106
Who's your boss?

170
00:11:30,940 --> 00:11:33,192
There's this drug dealer called Yankees,

171
00:11:33,275 --> 00:11:34,985
and we told him to bring his boss.

172
00:11:35,069 --> 00:11:37,947
So we brought this guy,
and three of them took Manager Cho.

173
00:11:38,030 --> 00:11:39,740
We need to catch this Yankees guy,

174
00:11:39,824 --> 00:11:41,492
but we don't know where to start,

175
00:11:41,575 --> 00:11:43,869
-and we don't...
-Hey!

176
00:11:43,953 --> 00:11:46,497
Are you high now? Why are you rambling?

177
00:11:46,872 --> 00:11:48,999
Tell me about this Yankees or whatever.

178
00:11:49,083 --> 00:11:50,084
And stop crying.

179
00:11:50,835 --> 00:11:53,713
We took him, beat him up,
and then asked him questions.

180
00:11:53,796 --> 00:11:55,047
-You mean Yankees?
-Yes.

181
00:11:55,131 --> 00:11:58,259
-And?
-And the names he told us

182
00:11:58,342 --> 00:12:00,052
were all fake.

183
00:12:01,679 --> 00:12:04,056
But we figured out
that he went to Yeoksam High.

184
00:12:04,140 --> 00:12:05,182
Yeoksam High.

185
00:12:05,975 --> 00:12:07,017
How?

186
00:12:07,101 --> 00:12:08,102
Tell me.

187
00:12:08,185 --> 00:12:09,311
How did you know that?

188
00:12:11,814 --> 00:12:13,149
It was in his pocket.

189
00:12:15,568 --> 00:12:18,320
A ticket from Dongdaemun Baseball Stadium.

190
00:12:19,572 --> 00:12:20,573
And?

191
00:12:21,490 --> 00:12:22,825
That day, there was a game

192
00:12:23,617 --> 00:12:24,785
between Yeoksam High...

193
00:12:24,869 --> 00:12:25,995
And Gwangju Jeil High!

194
00:12:28,414 --> 00:12:29,790
- The game that day?
- Yes.

195
00:12:29,874 --> 00:12:31,208
Yeoksam versus Gwangju Jeil?

196
00:12:31,292 --> 00:12:32,293
Yes!

197
00:12:32,668 --> 00:12:34,170
- That's why Yeoksam High?
- Yes.

198
00:12:36,422 --> 00:12:39,175
You God damn morons.

199
00:12:40,718 --> 00:12:42,094
We figured it out.

200
00:12:42,178 --> 00:12:44,805
Yeoksam High graduates
do have a close relationship

201
00:12:44,889 --> 00:12:46,223
- in Gangnam.
- Yes.

202
00:12:46,307 --> 00:12:47,308
Right.

203
00:13:07,953 --> 00:13:08,954
Hello?

204
00:13:09,038 --> 00:13:10,915
Come to Grand Plaza Hotel.

205
00:13:11,916 --> 00:13:13,542
Bring the Chinese too.

206
00:13:13,793 --> 00:13:15,669
Okay. I'll come with them.

207
00:13:15,753 --> 00:13:19,256
I'll tell you later where in the hotel.

208
00:13:19,799 --> 00:13:21,383
Can I come with my men?

209
00:13:22,134 --> 00:13:23,677
Bring just one bodyguard.

210
00:13:29,892 --> 00:13:31,060
Kwon Seungho.

211
00:13:31,727 --> 00:13:33,312
Yes, Boss?

212
00:13:33,395 --> 00:13:34,396
Come with me.

213
00:13:34,814 --> 00:13:36,899
The rest will wait in front of the hotel.

214
00:13:36,982 --> 00:13:37,983
Discreetly.

215
00:13:56,001 --> 00:13:57,711
What the fuck?

216
00:13:58,379 --> 00:14:00,130
Hey, move!

217
00:14:01,006 --> 00:14:02,675
You fucker.

218
00:14:02,758 --> 00:14:05,010
Where are you going in such a hurry?

219
00:14:05,302 --> 00:14:06,679
You almost hit him.

220
00:14:07,179 --> 00:14:08,973
-I'm sorry, sir.
-You almost hit him.

221
00:14:10,683 --> 00:14:12,434
Fucking Mercedes snob.

222
00:14:12,768 --> 00:14:13,811
Get out of the car.

223
00:14:13,936 --> 00:14:15,104
-This fucking...
-Come on.

224
00:14:15,396 --> 00:14:17,773
Get out. I'm a cop.

225
00:14:19,483 --> 00:14:21,277
What a moron.

226
00:14:23,988 --> 00:14:26,031
Drive better, you bastard.

227
00:14:26,782 --> 00:14:29,577
Hey, Mr. Jung. It's been a while.

228
00:14:29,660 --> 00:14:30,828
Hang on.

229
00:14:30,911 --> 00:14:31,912
Damn, my back hurts.

230
00:14:32,580 --> 00:14:34,164
Get out. I want to talk to you.

231
00:14:34,498 --> 00:14:37,334
What the fuck?

232
00:14:38,002 --> 00:14:39,295
Hey.

233
00:14:39,378 --> 00:14:41,422
What in the world are you doing?

234
00:14:41,505 --> 00:14:42,631
Do you have a warrant?

235
00:14:42,798 --> 00:14:46,719
Where did you learn about warrants?

236
00:14:46,802 --> 00:14:48,721
I said do you have a fucking warrant?

237
00:14:49,179 --> 00:14:50,472
You little...

238
00:14:51,765 --> 00:14:53,684
Wait, I haven't seen this face before.

239
00:14:54,101 --> 00:14:56,520
Are you new?

240
00:14:57,813 --> 00:14:59,356
Fucking bastard.

241
00:14:59,690 --> 00:15:01,191
Hey, aren't you coming out?

242
00:15:02,359 --> 00:15:04,028
Damn it.

243
00:15:06,071 --> 00:15:07,948
-What's going on?
-Mr. Jung.

244
00:15:08,449 --> 00:15:10,367
You know Yankees, right?

245
00:15:10,451 --> 00:15:13,370
It seems that punk offed
this dealer called Manager Cho.

246
00:15:13,913 --> 00:15:16,874
So I wanted to talk to him,
but I can't seem to locate him.

247
00:15:16,957 --> 00:15:19,084
He's your boy,
so you should know where he is.

248
00:15:19,168 --> 00:15:20,169
Where is he?

249
00:15:20,252 --> 00:15:21,462
I've never heard of him.

250
00:15:21,545 --> 00:15:22,588
Hey.

251
00:15:22,671 --> 00:15:24,131
Are you fucking serious?

252
00:15:24,214 --> 00:15:27,009
You're both
in the nightlife business in Gangnam.

253
00:15:27,134 --> 00:15:29,178
And you're all Yeoksam High alumni.

254
00:15:29,261 --> 00:15:31,305
Hello, Detective.

255
00:15:31,388 --> 00:15:33,223
What brings you here?

256
00:15:33,307 --> 00:15:34,600
Have you been well, Detective?

257
00:15:34,683 --> 00:15:35,976
Hey, Jungbae.

258
00:15:36,060 --> 00:15:38,103
No, because of you fuckers.

259
00:15:38,812 --> 00:15:41,231
Jungbae, Heesung.

260
00:15:41,315 --> 00:15:43,484
-Yes?
-Do you know Yankees?

261
00:15:43,901 --> 00:15:45,694
What? Yankees?

262
00:15:45,778 --> 00:15:47,529
No, we've never heard of him.

263
00:15:47,613 --> 00:15:50,824
Fuck, how could you not know him?
He went to your school.

264
00:15:50,950 --> 00:15:53,786
From Yeoksam High School,
the crappiest school in history.

265
00:15:54,203 --> 00:15:57,206
I know you thugs look after your alumni.

266
00:15:57,289 --> 00:15:58,832
Come on, Detective.

267
00:15:58,916 --> 00:16:02,044
There were 12 classes
for one grade in our school.

268
00:16:02,127 --> 00:16:04,838
And over 50 students in each.
So how should we know?

269
00:16:05,547 --> 00:16:09,259
Well, I can shake you guys down
to see if that's true.

270
00:16:09,343 --> 00:16:10,719
Detective.

271
00:16:11,178 --> 00:16:12,930
I'm sorry, but we're busy.

272
00:16:14,306 --> 00:16:15,349
Let's go.

273
00:16:19,019 --> 00:16:20,187
Hey, Jung Gicheul.

274
00:16:20,312 --> 00:16:23,732
If your lackey Yankees
really did off Manager Cho,

275
00:16:23,816 --> 00:16:25,401
this won't be a drug crime.

276
00:16:25,985 --> 00:16:27,319
It'll be a violent crime.

277
00:16:27,778 --> 00:16:29,238
What do you think that means?

278
00:16:32,741 --> 00:16:34,743
It means you might have to see me often.

279
00:16:36,745 --> 00:16:37,746
I'll see you around.

280
00:16:39,832 --> 00:16:40,916
Here's your damn key.

281
00:16:46,046 --> 00:16:49,550
Hey, what's your name?

282
00:16:54,722 --> 00:16:55,764
Yankees?

283
00:17:00,853 --> 00:17:01,854
Man...

284
00:17:02,938 --> 00:17:04,773
We're going to see each other often.

285
00:17:12,740 --> 00:17:15,200
What? You said you're busy.

286
00:17:16,160 --> 00:17:17,202
Get going.

287
00:17:18,078 --> 00:17:19,204
No need to see me off.

288
00:17:27,921 --> 00:17:31,050
Sir, just because you mentioned
this Yankees guy

289
00:17:31,133 --> 00:17:33,552
doesn't mean they'll go straight to him.

290
00:17:33,719 --> 00:17:35,512
What's the point of following them?

291
00:17:36,055 --> 00:17:38,140
Well, we had nothing to do anyway.

292
00:17:38,223 --> 00:17:39,224
Are you busy?

293
00:17:40,225 --> 00:17:42,478
Let's follow them just for today.

294
00:17:42,561 --> 00:17:44,521
To see where they hang out

295
00:17:44,605 --> 00:17:46,523
and what they're up to these days.

296
00:17:46,607 --> 00:17:48,067
I think we're losing them.

297
00:17:48,150 --> 00:17:50,694
It's okay. It's a fucking Mercedes.

298
00:17:50,778 --> 00:17:53,072
You can spot a Mercedes
from even 100 meters back.

299
00:18:05,167 --> 00:18:08,545
- Hello?
<i>- Come to Room 1203.</i>

300
00:18:54,466 --> 00:18:56,593
This is the security room.
All clear, over.

301
00:18:56,677 --> 00:18:58,679
Good. All areas are clear.

302
00:18:58,762 --> 00:19:00,597
No sign of any intruders.

303
00:19:00,681 --> 00:19:02,182
The parking lot is clear, over.

304
00:19:11,525 --> 00:19:12,985
Park Junmo. Nice.

305
00:19:15,445 --> 00:19:17,656
Jung Gicheul has arrived
at the hotel. Stay alert.

306
00:19:17,739 --> 00:19:20,450
Move only when we secure the evidence.

307
00:19:26,456 --> 00:19:28,917
This bug can cover a 1km radius.

308
00:19:29,543 --> 00:19:31,461
Detective Park will be wearing this.

309
00:19:31,545 --> 00:19:33,422
<i>I'll monitor the situation around him</i>

310
00:19:33,505 --> 00:19:35,090
<i>and record in real-time.</i>

311
00:19:45,851 --> 00:19:48,103
They're taking the elevator now.

312
00:19:50,731 --> 00:19:52,691
The Korean guys just entered the lobby.

313
00:19:52,774 --> 00:19:53,942
They'll get in one soon too.

314
00:19:54,193 --> 00:19:55,694
Which floor is this?

315
00:19:55,777 --> 00:19:56,778
It's the 12th floor.

316
00:20:05,162 --> 00:20:07,581
Hwang Mingoo, that damn pig.

317
00:20:08,999 --> 00:20:10,584
<i>Someone's out in the corridor.</i>

318
00:20:42,366 --> 00:20:44,701
The Korean guys have arrived
at the 12th floor.

319
00:20:50,540 --> 00:20:52,793
They're getting a pat down
before going in.

320
00:20:53,252 --> 00:20:54,378
A pat down?

321
00:21:47,848 --> 00:21:49,349
One of the Korean guys passed.

322
00:21:49,433 --> 00:21:50,809
It's the second one's turn.

323
00:21:53,895 --> 00:21:55,022
For God's sake.

324
00:22:31,683 --> 00:22:34,102
You better fucking watch it.

325
00:23:02,881 --> 00:23:06,385
You're one meticulous guy.

326
00:23:23,777 --> 00:23:25,445
-Activate the fire alarm.
-What?

327
00:23:25,529 --> 00:23:27,781
Tell them to activate the fire alarm. Now!

328
00:23:27,864 --> 00:23:30,909
Enough with the fucking patting.
Are you trying to make me hard?

329
00:23:31,743 --> 00:23:33,453
Come on. The fire alarm!

330
00:23:47,175 --> 00:23:49,302
I'll go check and see what's going on.

331
00:24:18,039 --> 00:24:19,666
Dohyung.

332
00:24:19,749 --> 00:24:22,627
The Japanese guys are doing
a thorough pat down on us.

333
00:24:22,711 --> 00:24:24,463
I think I'll have to throw away the bug.

334
00:24:24,880 --> 00:24:25,881
I'm throwing it away.

335
00:24:28,633 --> 00:24:29,718
Wait.

336
00:24:32,762 --> 00:24:34,598
I think I can handle this.

337
00:24:51,448 --> 00:24:53,033
I think it was a false alarm.

338
00:25:34,491 --> 00:25:36,660
Take those two
to the bedroom and wait.

339
00:26:10,569 --> 00:26:12,696
Damn it!

340
00:26:13,446 --> 00:26:15,532
Turn down the volume. It's too loud.

341
00:26:22,539 --> 00:26:23,582
Motherfucker.

342
00:26:25,750 --> 00:26:28,878
Hey, can't you speak?

343
00:26:36,803 --> 00:26:39,848
You seem to have
a pretty timid personality.

344
00:26:40,348 --> 00:26:44,060
The Japanese police has started
to watch us closely.

345
00:26:45,520 --> 00:26:46,896
Father couldn't make it?

346
00:26:48,481 --> 00:26:49,858
If I get the chance,

347
00:26:50,775 --> 00:26:53,987
I'd love to meet your father in China.

348
00:26:55,405 --> 00:26:56,948
You can meet with me.

349
00:26:58,992 --> 00:27:03,163
Oh, are you not the actual boss in Japan?

350
00:27:04,581 --> 00:27:06,458
How's Professor Yoon doing?

351
00:27:06,541 --> 00:27:09,294
Great. We're treating her very well.

352
00:27:09,961 --> 00:27:11,171
Do you know her well?

353
00:27:12,005 --> 00:27:16,384
We bought a lot of product
from her 20 years ago.

354
00:27:17,302 --> 00:27:18,386
What's that?

355
00:27:19,679 --> 00:27:21,473
I brought your down payment to return it.

356
00:27:22,223 --> 00:27:23,558
Why give it back?

357
00:27:23,642 --> 00:27:25,226
Are you quitting this business?

358
00:27:26,144 --> 00:27:27,228
No.

359
00:27:28,563 --> 00:27:31,107
We'll resend the product,
and when it arrives safely,

360
00:27:31,191 --> 00:27:32,525
you can pay us then.

361
00:27:32,609 --> 00:27:35,320
So you're taking it back later.

362
00:27:36,404 --> 00:27:38,281
Isn't that a bit too formal?

363
00:27:39,991 --> 00:27:40,992
What about the rat?

364
00:27:41,743 --> 00:27:43,078
Did you find him?

365
00:27:43,161 --> 00:27:44,329
Yes.

366
00:27:44,829 --> 00:27:45,997
Who was it?

367
00:27:46,289 --> 00:27:48,041
It was one of our members.

368
00:27:48,917 --> 00:27:50,669
Was he directly involved in this?

369
00:27:50,960 --> 00:27:51,961
No.

370
00:27:53,171 --> 00:27:56,216
Does he know about our business?

371
00:27:56,883 --> 00:27:57,884
No.

372
00:27:58,677 --> 00:28:00,136
I just told you.

373
00:28:00,220 --> 00:28:01,721
The police are monitoring us.

374
00:28:01,846 --> 00:28:05,016
Could that be because of Song Donghyuk?

375
00:28:05,100 --> 00:28:06,768
He must have told his gang

376
00:28:07,727 --> 00:28:10,021
that he was going to meet Father.

377
00:28:11,064 --> 00:28:13,942
But he never came back,
so maybe they reported him missing,

378
00:28:15,026 --> 00:28:17,153
and the Japanese cops
found out about that.

379
00:28:17,445 --> 00:28:20,365
So it's because of us and not you?

380
00:28:22,701 --> 00:28:26,204
You see, you might also be

381
00:28:26,287 --> 00:28:29,791
under someone's watch because of that rat.

382
00:28:37,799 --> 00:28:41,010
The bag you brought.

383
00:28:41,553 --> 00:28:45,473
Take it down, stand there
for five minutes, and come back

384
00:28:46,433 --> 00:28:49,853
as if you're waiting for a drug dealer.

385
00:28:50,979 --> 00:28:52,897
Then, I'll be able to see from here

386
00:28:52,981 --> 00:28:55,608
if there are cops following you.

387
00:28:55,692 --> 00:28:59,070
And if you're with a drug dealer or not.

388
00:29:01,239 --> 00:29:03,199
Is this Father's order?

389
00:29:03,283 --> 00:29:04,492
You don't want to do it?

390
00:29:05,702 --> 00:29:08,288
Then, our deal is over.

391
00:29:15,044 --> 00:29:17,338
Is this the end of our business?

392
00:29:18,548 --> 00:29:20,133
What a shame.

393
00:29:59,923 --> 00:30:02,801
I think those fuckers
are actually planning to get us.

394
00:30:04,636 --> 00:30:05,804
Should we keep waiting?

395
00:30:07,138 --> 00:30:08,139
What?

396
00:30:09,390 --> 00:30:10,850
They're waiting too.

397
00:30:13,728 --> 00:30:15,772
Hwang Mingoo, that fucking pig.

398
00:30:16,898 --> 00:30:19,025
Why does he always fuck with us?

399
00:30:42,298 --> 00:30:43,383
What's going on?

400
00:30:52,934 --> 00:30:54,519
I think he just came out.

401
00:31:00,066 --> 00:31:03,194
Actually, I sent him down

402
00:31:03,278 --> 00:31:05,655
so we can talk alone.

403
00:31:07,532 --> 00:31:10,952
You want to trade
with us directly, don't you?

404
00:31:17,083 --> 00:31:18,543
Because if we trade directly,

405
00:31:19,460 --> 00:31:23,256
we can share the money
that goes to Mr. Jung.

406
00:31:37,478 --> 00:31:38,938
Maybe something went wrong.

407
00:31:52,827 --> 00:31:55,872
I'm now with the woman from China.

408
00:31:56,664 --> 00:31:57,790
I'll let you two talk.

409
00:31:58,416 --> 00:31:59,542
Fuck.

410
00:31:59,626 --> 00:32:01,419
Those pricks always mess things up.

411
00:32:04,255 --> 00:32:06,466
Captain, could he be waiting for a dealer?

412
00:32:06,674 --> 00:32:08,801
Should we grab him when they meet?

413
00:32:20,146 --> 00:32:21,648
Don't move. Let's wait for now.

414
00:32:21,731 --> 00:32:23,024
Wait...

415
00:32:31,032 --> 00:32:35,119
Hey, what do you think is
inside a thug's bag like that?

416
00:32:38,623 --> 00:32:39,791
Something they stole?

417
00:32:41,334 --> 00:32:42,669
Or drugs?

418
00:32:46,089 --> 00:32:47,840
<i>Can I call you Miss Lee?</i>

419
00:32:48,758 --> 00:32:50,802
<i>I'm Kim Hwaseong.</i>

420
00:32:50,885 --> 00:32:53,721
You must be Mr. Jung's father.

421
00:32:54,222 --> 00:32:55,765
<i>My family name is Kim.</i>

422
00:32:56,349 --> 00:33:01,020
She asked if we wanted
to trade directly without Jung Gicheul.

423
00:33:01,104 --> 00:33:05,233
<i>Do you know</i>
<i>why I've used Gicheul as the carrier</i>

424
00:33:05,316 --> 00:33:07,193
<i>and made him rich?</i>

425
00:33:08,152 --> 00:33:10,822
I'm on the verge of becoming

426
00:33:11,572 --> 00:33:13,491
the boss of Yoshioka-gumi now.

427
00:33:13,616 --> 00:33:17,620
<i>I don't want my name</i>
<i>to be connected to the drug trade.</i>

428
00:33:22,125 --> 00:33:23,251
Damn.

429
00:33:23,793 --> 00:33:25,962
We're about to witness the deal.

430
00:33:27,547 --> 00:33:30,633
<i>That means I need to be invisible</i>
<i>in this trade.</i>

431
00:33:31,175 --> 00:33:34,137
<i>So even if the Japanese police</i>
<i>look in on me,</i>

432
00:33:34,262 --> 00:33:38,516
it'll appear like this was all
the Korean gang's doing

433
00:33:38,599 --> 00:33:41,394
to secretly sell illegal imports
from China in Japan.

434
00:33:42,103 --> 00:33:43,396
That is why.

435
00:33:44,856 --> 00:33:47,859
The Korean gang is
solely responsible for this.

436
00:33:49,485 --> 00:33:53,865
So what is it you want to do now?

437
00:33:56,325 --> 00:33:57,910
This is fucking annoying.

438
00:33:59,370 --> 00:34:02,623
<i>We can use someone other than Gicheul.</i>

439
00:34:02,707 --> 00:34:04,834
<i>I have a lot of friends in Korea.</i>

440
00:34:04,917 --> 00:34:07,211
<i>We can just choose one of them.</i>

441
00:34:07,295 --> 00:34:08,588
<i>My question is</i>

442
00:34:08,671 --> 00:34:11,007
<i>if you could produce</i>
<i>the same quality of product</i>

443
00:34:11,424 --> 00:34:14,844
and send it safely to the new person
as you have been doing.

444
00:34:16,304 --> 00:34:18,723
<i>Do you think you could do that?</i>

445
00:34:18,806 --> 00:34:20,933
You see, this is actually up to me.

446
00:34:22,727 --> 00:34:25,146
I decide which Korean

447
00:34:26,230 --> 00:34:27,982
I want to sell our stuff to.

448
00:34:28,691 --> 00:34:32,820
Whatever Gicheul is paying you,

449
00:34:32,904 --> 00:34:37,533
<i>I'll give you 15% extra.</i>

450
00:34:52,215 --> 00:34:54,425
We came to get Yankees,

451
00:34:54,509 --> 00:34:55,968
but we got an even bigger one.

452
00:35:24,747 --> 00:35:26,707
Who are those bastards?

453
00:35:27,125 --> 00:35:28,626
God damn it.

454
00:35:34,632 --> 00:35:35,633
Where did they go?

455
00:35:38,719 --> 00:35:40,179
They're pretty damn fast.

456
00:35:41,514 --> 00:35:43,266
Hey, stop them.

457
00:35:45,309 --> 00:35:46,769
-Stop there.
-Detective.

458
00:35:46,894 --> 00:35:49,021
There's something we need to do.

459
00:35:49,105 --> 00:35:50,815
I said stop.

460
00:35:55,153 --> 00:35:56,404
Are we good now?

461
00:35:56,654 --> 00:35:58,865
Now, it'll be Miss Lee's decision.

462
00:36:05,037 --> 00:36:06,330
Hey, Chinese man.

463
00:36:09,625 --> 00:36:10,835
Can't you speak Korean?

464
00:36:11,878 --> 00:36:13,129
Can't you speak

465
00:36:14,755 --> 00:36:15,756
Korean?

466
00:36:16,883 --> 00:36:19,135
Your boss speaks fluent Korean though.

467
00:36:23,806 --> 00:36:27,685
Does he understand me or not?

468
00:36:29,020 --> 00:36:31,814
Why are the guys here so quiet?

469
00:36:38,237 --> 00:36:40,239
Are you still using matches?

470
00:36:41,032 --> 00:36:42,950
Are you from the Qing Dynasty or what?

471
00:36:45,494 --> 00:36:47,163
Here. Take this.

472
00:36:47,622 --> 00:36:49,290
It's my gift for you. Take it.

473
00:37:10,561 --> 00:37:11,854
The police are here.

474
00:37:13,105 --> 00:37:14,815
There's a cop coming.

475
00:37:14,899 --> 00:37:16,943
I'll handle things over there.

476
00:37:17,026 --> 00:37:18,486
Take the people inside and run...

477
00:37:18,569 --> 00:37:19,779
Hey!

478
00:37:22,823 --> 00:37:25,576
I said the police are here. Understand?

479
00:37:26,244 --> 00:37:27,578
Take them and run. Now.

480
00:37:30,706 --> 00:37:31,791
Detective.

481
00:37:33,334 --> 00:37:34,418
What brings you here?

482
00:37:34,502 --> 00:37:35,753
What do you think?

483
00:37:36,420 --> 00:37:37,797
I told you we'd meet again.

484
00:37:38,422 --> 00:37:40,216
What's Jung Gicheul doing in there?

485
00:37:42,677 --> 00:37:44,220
He's doing some business.

486
00:37:44,303 --> 00:37:47,473
Business, my fucking ass. Move.

487
00:37:48,849 --> 00:37:49,850
I said move.

488
00:37:50,351 --> 00:37:51,352
You hear me?

489
00:37:52,270 --> 00:37:55,106
Stop looking at me and move.

490
00:37:55,189 --> 00:37:57,566
-Hey.
-I'm sorry.

491
00:37:57,650 --> 00:37:59,735
Have you lost your mind? Move.

492
00:37:59,819 --> 00:38:02,113
Hey, Mr. Jung!

493
00:38:02,738 --> 00:38:05,866
Jung Gicheul!

494
00:38:05,950 --> 00:38:07,910
There you are.

495
00:38:07,994 --> 00:38:10,830
Hey, Mr. Jung!

496
00:38:10,913 --> 00:38:12,665
Jung Gicheul, come here.

497
00:38:12,748 --> 00:38:15,334
Mr. Jung. Hey!

498
00:38:15,418 --> 00:38:17,962
- Let's go finish our talk.
- What were you doing?

499
00:38:18,045 --> 00:38:19,547
Were you all playing poker?

500
00:38:19,839 --> 00:38:20,840
Come here!

501
00:38:20,923 --> 00:38:22,091
Stop!

502
00:38:22,174 --> 00:38:24,635
Stop right there, you bastard!

503
00:38:25,720 --> 00:38:27,263
Have you lost your damn mind?

504
00:38:30,766 --> 00:38:32,601
Come on, Detective.

505
00:38:32,685 --> 00:38:34,520
-Don't be like this.
-Did you hit me?

506
00:38:34,603 --> 00:38:35,896
Did you just hit me?

507
00:38:52,079 --> 00:38:53,664
Come here, you bastard.

508
00:39:25,863 --> 00:39:28,574
Mr. Jung, does this mean
our trade is over now?

509
00:39:32,078 --> 00:39:33,954
I guess it really is.

510
00:39:34,038 --> 00:39:37,541
It looks like he has
great trust in his man.

511
00:39:41,962 --> 00:39:44,340
Go help Mr. Jung's man up there.

512
00:39:45,174 --> 00:39:46,175
Let's go.

513
00:39:51,806 --> 00:39:53,682
Detectives. To the 12th floor.

514
00:39:54,725 --> 00:39:56,102
-Where are they?
-Here.

515
00:39:58,312 --> 00:40:00,064
-We found them.
<i>-Arrest him.</i>

516
00:40:00,147 --> 00:40:01,565
Which one of the two?

517
00:40:01,649 --> 00:40:03,484
Who the hell are you?

518
00:40:03,901 --> 00:40:05,778
-The bigger one.
-Okay.

519
00:40:05,861 --> 00:40:07,696
-Do you have a death wish?
-Fuck off.

520
00:40:07,780 --> 00:40:09,031
Motherfucker.

521
00:40:09,115 --> 00:40:10,825
-Freeze!
-What are you doing?

522
00:40:10,908 --> 00:40:11,909
Who are you?

523
00:40:11,992 --> 00:40:13,202
You're under arrest.

524
00:40:13,285 --> 00:40:15,704
-Let go of me, you bastards!
-Stop moving!

525
00:40:15,788 --> 00:40:19,458
I'm a cop, you fuckers!

526
00:40:20,459 --> 00:40:23,337
I'm a real fucking cop, for God's sake!

527
00:40:23,421 --> 00:40:25,464
You motherfuckers!

528
00:40:25,548 --> 00:40:26,674
For fuck's sake!

529
00:40:33,889 --> 00:40:36,225
Captain, he really is a cop.

530
00:40:36,308 --> 00:40:37,435
A cop?

531
00:40:37,726 --> 00:40:39,353
<i>What about the other guy?</i>

532
00:40:39,437 --> 00:40:40,438
He ran away.

533
00:40:42,690 --> 00:40:44,066
Pull out now.

534
00:40:59,457 --> 00:41:04,587
Damn it. Those God damn fuckers!

535
00:41:07,006 --> 00:41:08,007
Are you okay?

536
00:41:08,215 --> 00:41:09,633
Yes, I'm okay.

537
00:41:09,967 --> 00:41:12,136
Let's get out when things quiet down.

538
00:41:12,470 --> 00:41:13,554
Yes, Boss.

539
00:41:35,701 --> 00:41:37,745
That fucking pig!

540
00:41:37,828 --> 00:41:39,914
You should bribe him or something.

541
00:41:39,997 --> 00:41:41,457
God damn it.

542
00:41:54,720 --> 00:41:56,764
It would've been okay to let the cop in.

543
00:42:00,518 --> 00:42:02,603
Just talking isn't illegal.

544
00:42:02,686 --> 00:42:05,272
That cop would've found
something on us somehow.

545
00:42:05,356 --> 00:42:07,191
Also, that passport of yours...

546
00:42:09,401 --> 00:42:10,778
Isn't it forged?

547
00:42:12,446 --> 00:42:13,989
So you were protecting me?

548
00:42:15,366 --> 00:42:18,202
From getting arrested?

549
00:42:22,081 --> 00:42:24,041
It seems you had a pretty wild scuffle.

550
00:42:28,546 --> 00:42:30,548
Doesn't that mean
things will get more serious?

551
00:42:31,799 --> 00:42:34,969
You have quite the talent
for making things worse.

552
00:42:39,640 --> 00:42:42,434
Mr. Jung, you have
a wild way of doing business.

553
00:42:44,520 --> 00:42:46,021
But it's too dangerous to work with.

554
00:42:46,230 --> 00:42:48,232
I got this wound recently.

555
00:42:48,315 --> 00:42:49,858
And it's minor.

556
00:42:49,984 --> 00:42:50,985
And until now,

557
00:42:51,068 --> 00:42:54,154
we've never had any issues
caused by this kind of matter.

558
00:42:54,238 --> 00:42:55,573
I can guarantee you that.

559
00:42:55,656 --> 00:42:56,657
I see.

560
00:42:58,993 --> 00:43:01,120
So this isn't even an issue to you?

561
00:43:04,081 --> 00:43:07,209
Could you at least do something
about the wound on your back?

562
00:43:07,918 --> 00:43:10,170
People might think
someone's dead and call the police.

563
00:43:12,798 --> 00:43:13,924
Come here.

564
00:43:20,681 --> 00:43:22,308
Treat his wound.

565
00:43:24,476 --> 00:43:27,104
He risked his life to take responsibility,

566
00:43:27,354 --> 00:43:29,857
which isn't a bad quality
for a business partner.

567
00:43:32,318 --> 00:43:34,945
Gosh, you're so annoying!

568
00:43:35,029 --> 00:43:38,198
How many times do I have to repeat myself?

569
00:43:38,282 --> 00:43:41,327
From Room 1203,

570
00:43:41,410 --> 00:43:44,038
a God damn parade of people came out.

571
00:43:44,121 --> 00:43:45,289
Both men and women.

572
00:43:45,372 --> 00:43:46,707
And the room was huge as hell!

573
00:43:46,790 --> 00:43:49,376
It doesn't make sense that
nobody reserved the room!

574
00:43:49,460 --> 00:43:52,838
There was no reservation made
for Room 1203 today.

575
00:43:53,088 --> 00:43:54,673
Then, who were those people?

576
00:43:54,757 --> 00:43:55,841
Ghosts?

577
00:43:57,009 --> 00:43:59,637
Hey, lady. You better tell me the truth.

578
00:44:00,346 --> 00:44:02,473
Or you'll be tagged
with a criminal record.

579
00:44:02,556 --> 00:44:03,599
Show me the register.

580
00:44:03,807 --> 00:44:05,726
You think I'm joking?

581
00:44:05,809 --> 00:44:07,019
Sir.

582
00:44:07,895 --> 00:44:09,563
-I looked for them.
-And?

583
00:44:09,647 --> 00:44:10,898
I can't find anyone.

584
00:44:11,815 --> 00:44:13,776
God damn it.

585
00:44:14,443 --> 00:44:15,486
Let's go then.

586
00:44:37,424 --> 00:44:41,679
The Japanese proposed
that we use a different Korean carrier.

587
00:44:44,348 --> 00:44:48,143
And they offered to pay me
15% more than what you do.

588
00:44:49,812 --> 00:44:51,188
We'll pay double the price

589
00:44:51,814 --> 00:44:53,691
that we used to pay per kilogram.

590
00:44:58,904 --> 00:45:00,656
Money is not the problem here.

591
00:45:03,617 --> 00:45:06,078
What are you going to do
to regain my trust?

592
00:45:12,084 --> 00:45:15,713
Of course, trading with someone new
would be a hard decision for us too.

593
00:45:16,672 --> 00:45:17,840
What should we do?

594
00:45:27,683 --> 00:45:30,602
You have a good man
who is willing to give up

595
00:45:31,353 --> 00:45:33,021
everything for you.

596
00:45:34,273 --> 00:45:37,609
I heard Korea's government
was pretty powerful too.

597
00:45:38,652 --> 00:45:40,946
Now that the police are involved,

598
00:45:41,029 --> 00:45:42,781
let's see how it goes.

599
00:45:50,622 --> 00:45:53,000
Why are you going
to such lengths for this?

600
00:46:02,468 --> 00:46:06,764
Because I trust my boss.

601
00:46:09,683 --> 00:46:12,686
You value trust too, don't you?

602
00:46:14,062 --> 00:46:17,065
We're the same.
Trust is our number one priority.

603
00:46:17,858 --> 00:46:21,904
Especially in this deal.

604
00:46:23,655 --> 00:46:25,157
What do you think

605
00:46:26,116 --> 00:46:27,242
of that crazy man?

606
00:46:30,120 --> 00:46:31,371
He seems loyal.

607
00:46:36,752 --> 00:46:38,045
Looks like a good guy.

608
00:46:38,128 --> 00:46:39,129
Hmm.

609
00:46:51,099 --> 00:46:52,684
Hello.

610
00:46:52,768 --> 00:46:54,520
I'd like to call Room 608.

611
00:46:56,480 --> 00:46:58,732
- <i>Hello?</i>
- This is Miss Lee.

612
00:46:58,982 --> 00:46:59,983
Hello.

613
00:47:02,319 --> 00:47:03,570
Must I decide today?

614
00:47:19,086 --> 00:47:20,838
I'll take a few more days to think.

615
00:47:39,022 --> 00:47:40,858
It's been a while
since I've visited Korea.

616
00:47:43,318 --> 00:47:45,153
I should do some sightseeing.

617
00:47:49,366 --> 00:47:50,951
And check out the real estate.

618
00:47:52,536 --> 00:47:55,998
I should probably stop
secretly taking money into China.

619
00:47:56,915 --> 00:47:58,500
I might as well invest it here.

620
00:48:02,379 --> 00:48:04,006
I'll need a tour guide.

621
00:48:09,219 --> 00:48:10,470
I guess you can't, right?

622
00:48:12,264 --> 00:48:14,725
You hit a cop, so you should stay low.

623
00:48:23,775 --> 00:48:24,776
Hello?

624
00:48:25,819 --> 00:48:27,821
<i>Are you with Miss Lee?</i>

625
00:48:29,448 --> 00:48:30,699
Yes, I am.

626
00:48:39,166 --> 00:48:40,375
<i>Miss Lee.</i>

627
00:48:41,668 --> 00:48:43,587
You're one impatient man.

628
00:48:43,670 --> 00:48:45,297
I didn't expect you to call already.

629
00:48:45,631 --> 00:48:47,799
The boss has delivered

630
00:48:48,342 --> 00:48:49,676
<i>his message.</i>

631
00:48:50,260 --> 00:48:53,889
<i>He says he'll be okay</i>
<i>with whatever decision you make.</i>

632
00:48:54,222 --> 00:48:57,643
However, regardless of the decision,

633
00:48:58,352 --> 00:49:03,023
<i>he wants this trade to stop</i>
<i>for the time being.</i>

634
00:49:03,106 --> 00:49:07,277
<i>And since the police</i>
<i>interrupted</i> our <i>meeting,</i>

635
00:49:07,361 --> 00:49:08,695
<i>he is furious.</i>

636
00:49:08,779 --> 00:49:10,614
That cop didn't come because of this.

637
00:49:10,697 --> 00:49:12,532
<i>Whatever the reason was,</i>

638
00:49:12,824 --> 00:49:16,203
he came because of you, didn't he?

639
00:49:16,411 --> 00:49:19,790
<i>Only when everything feels safe again,</i>

640
00:49:20,749 --> 00:49:23,293
<i>he will reopen the trade.</i>

641
00:49:23,752 --> 00:49:24,962
<i>Miss Lee.</i>

642
00:49:25,462 --> 00:49:28,382
I hope you make a wise decision.

643
00:49:32,427 --> 00:49:36,723
God damn it!

644
00:49:45,816 --> 00:49:47,567
Mr. Jung, can we talk?

645
00:50:19,307 --> 00:50:22,019
Without customers,
there's no point in production.

646
00:50:24,479 --> 00:50:27,232
That's going to play
the biggest role in my decision.

647
00:50:30,819 --> 00:50:32,320
What can I do to help you?

648
00:50:32,487 --> 00:50:34,031
There's nothing you can do right now.

649
00:50:36,408 --> 00:50:40,704
Your Japanese father is acting
like he's the king.

650
00:50:54,051 --> 00:50:56,970
Assaulting a police officer
and obstruction of justice.

651
00:51:00,182 --> 00:51:03,018
So you'll get out of prison
when your hair's gray?

652
00:51:04,644 --> 00:51:07,647
Well, I'll see you with gray hair then.

653
00:51:13,570 --> 00:51:14,863
If things work out...

654
00:51:15,864 --> 00:51:18,033
I'd like you to be my tour guide.

655
00:51:29,544 --> 00:51:31,421
- Odds.
- Damn it.

656
00:51:44,935 --> 00:51:46,228
Who are you?

657
00:51:46,311 --> 00:51:47,854
How may I help you?

658
00:51:47,938 --> 00:51:49,106
We're the police.

659
00:51:52,234 --> 00:51:54,361
Jung Gicheul is back, right?

660
00:51:58,532 --> 00:52:00,450
Gicheul!

661
00:52:00,534 --> 00:52:02,244
Come on out while I'm being nice.

662
00:52:04,287 --> 00:52:05,372
What the fuck?

663
00:52:05,455 --> 00:52:07,624
Sir!

664
00:52:07,749 --> 00:52:09,626
Fuck, what is it?

665
00:52:09,709 --> 00:52:11,294
Could you come check the CCTV?

666
00:52:11,545 --> 00:52:13,922
If you're going to investigate,
bring a warrant.

667
00:52:14,965 --> 00:52:16,299
As I always say,

668
00:52:17,217 --> 00:52:19,386
these underling pricks never listen.

669
00:52:27,227 --> 00:52:28,812
Damn, these motherfuckers.

670
00:52:29,187 --> 00:52:30,647
They're coming.

671
00:52:30,730 --> 00:52:32,065
-Did you lock the door?
-What?

672
00:52:32,190 --> 00:52:34,651
-The door.
-Go lock the door, you fuck!

673
00:52:40,365 --> 00:52:41,658
"Gangnam Industry"?

674
00:52:42,117 --> 00:52:43,535
You have to be fucking kidding me.

675
00:52:47,747 --> 00:52:50,083
Open up. This is the police.

676
00:52:53,587 --> 00:52:55,589
We're the police. Open up!

677
00:52:55,672 --> 00:52:57,841
Sir, what should we do?

678
00:52:58,049 --> 00:52:59,676
Did we commit a fucking crime?

679
00:52:59,759 --> 00:53:00,760
-I'm sorry.
-Did we?

680
00:53:00,844 --> 00:53:02,179
Step aside.

681
00:53:02,929 --> 00:53:03,972
Bastards.

682
00:53:04,055 --> 00:53:05,265
Hey!

683
00:53:07,100 --> 00:53:08,518
You're not going to open up?

684
00:53:10,562 --> 00:53:13,273
I'll give you three seconds.

685
00:53:16,276 --> 00:53:17,527
Three.

686
00:53:19,905 --> 00:53:21,323
Two!

687
00:53:21,406 --> 00:53:22,782
Those motherfuckers.

688
00:53:23,783 --> 00:53:27,329
One! Open the door, you fuckers!

689
00:53:31,374 --> 00:53:32,375
Fuck.

690
00:53:33,668 --> 00:53:37,005
Fucking bastards!

691
00:53:37,088 --> 00:53:38,715
Open up!

692
00:53:39,341 --> 00:53:41,051
Open the door, motherfuckers!

693
00:53:41,843 --> 00:53:43,094
Fuck!

694
00:53:45,931 --> 00:53:48,516
God damn it.

695
00:53:48,892 --> 00:53:50,810
You bastards!

696
00:53:52,520 --> 00:53:53,605
Fuck!

697
00:53:55,649 --> 00:53:56,983
You fuckers.

698
00:53:59,903 --> 00:54:02,447
What do you think you are doing?

699
00:54:04,157 --> 00:54:08,495
Looks like you've been doing
some manual labor.

700
00:54:12,374 --> 00:54:16,419
Just because you're a cop,
it doesn't mean you can act like this.

701
00:54:17,837 --> 00:54:19,089
Shit.

702
00:54:23,385 --> 00:54:25,762
A cop can act like this, you motherfucker.

703
00:54:26,012 --> 00:54:27,138
What the...

704
00:54:27,222 --> 00:54:29,015
Stop, you damn thugs.

705
00:54:30,225 --> 00:54:33,561
Get back. Make a line.

706
00:54:33,645 --> 00:54:37,065
-God damn it.
-I said make a line! Move!

707
00:54:38,566 --> 00:54:39,734
Where's Jung Gicheul?

708
00:54:40,151 --> 00:54:42,112
I said he's not here.

709
00:54:45,073 --> 00:54:46,866
Then, call him.

710
00:54:46,950 --> 00:54:48,827
We don't know where he went.

711
00:54:52,914 --> 00:54:55,500
Call his cellphone, you fuck.

712
00:54:55,667 --> 00:54:58,670
He didn't tell us his phone number. Okay?

713
00:54:59,879 --> 00:55:00,922
What the fuck?

714
00:55:02,590 --> 00:55:03,633
He didn't...

715
00:55:03,717 --> 00:55:04,718
tell you...

716
00:55:04,801 --> 00:55:06,511
his phone number?

717
00:55:06,594 --> 00:55:08,346
So does that mean...

718
00:55:08,430 --> 00:55:10,598
you deserve a lot of hits?

719
00:55:10,682 --> 00:55:11,766
You fuck!

720
00:55:11,850 --> 00:55:13,268
You deserve to be hit?

721
00:55:13,351 --> 00:55:15,437
A whole fucking ton?

722
00:55:15,520 --> 00:55:16,813
Is that what you mean?

723
00:55:16,896 --> 00:55:18,189
Is it, you motherfucker?

724
00:55:22,569 --> 00:55:23,653
Hey!

725
00:55:24,404 --> 00:55:27,032
I guess you don't know
his number either. Right?

726
00:55:28,616 --> 00:55:29,868
I will...

727
00:55:32,454 --> 00:55:34,164
help you remember.

728
00:55:34,581 --> 00:55:35,623
Okay.

729
00:55:36,374 --> 00:55:37,375
Got it.

730
00:55:39,919 --> 00:55:42,964
They destroyed our office and left.

731
00:55:43,423 --> 00:55:45,508
-What do we do?
-God damn it.

732
00:55:45,592 --> 00:55:47,969
Of all people, it's that fucking lunatic
Hwang Mingoo.

733
00:55:49,220 --> 00:55:50,263
Chief Seo.

734
00:55:50,347 --> 00:55:51,931
Call all of our emergency contacts.

735
00:55:52,015 --> 00:55:54,225
Tell them to close the stores and lie low.

736
00:55:54,642 --> 00:55:55,769
All of the stores?

737
00:55:56,811 --> 00:55:58,855
Just do as I say, you bastard.

738
00:55:59,022 --> 00:56:00,357
I'll turn myself in.

739
00:56:01,566 --> 00:56:03,068
What?

740
00:56:03,151 --> 00:56:05,945
Somebody has to step up to resolve this.

741
00:56:06,571 --> 00:56:08,073
I caused this,

742
00:56:08,448 --> 00:56:10,450
so I'll take care of it
one way or another.

743
00:56:18,083 --> 00:56:19,376
Hey, Kwon Seungho.

744
00:56:19,459 --> 00:56:20,877
You bastard.

745
00:56:22,003 --> 00:56:24,881
You think I'll just let you go to prison?

746
00:56:25,298 --> 00:56:26,299
Boss.

747
00:56:27,258 --> 00:56:28,760
I'll go take care of things

748
00:56:28,843 --> 00:56:30,970
so nothing bad happens
to you or the company.

749
00:56:36,267 --> 00:56:37,310
In return...

750
00:56:41,106 --> 00:56:42,774
if I manage to work things out,

751
00:56:45,985 --> 00:56:47,612
I have a favor to ask of you.

752
00:56:53,743 --> 00:56:56,204
The trade with Japan and China.

753
00:56:57,247 --> 00:56:58,957
Let me join it.

754
00:57:02,502 --> 00:57:04,337
I'll go and take care of this then.

755
00:57:11,010 --> 00:57:13,805
Hurry up and give me
an answer, you bastard.
