00:00:01,668 --> 00:00:08,466
THE CHARACTERS, PLACES, ORGANIZATIONS AND
EVENTS IN THIS DRAMA ARE WORKS OF FICTION

2
00:00:20,186 --> 00:00:21,187
Shoot!

3
00:00:29,612 --> 00:00:30,780
Fucking hell.

4
00:00:33,283 --> 00:00:34,284
Oh, boy.

5
00:00:35,493 --> 00:00:36,494
Fuck.

6
00:00:40,373 --> 00:00:43,626
This is all because of you, fucker.

7
00:00:44,252 --> 00:00:45,545
It's his first time.

8
00:00:48,006 --> 00:00:49,924
Take your time and try again.

9
00:00:51,551 --> 00:00:53,511
Aim right, motherfucker.

10
00:00:54,137 --> 00:00:55,472
Kill him.

11
00:00:55,555 --> 00:00:56,556
Hey.

12
00:00:57,432 --> 00:00:58,683
Hey!

13
00:00:58,767 --> 00:01:01,644
Are you fucking missing
on accident or on purpose?

14
00:01:11,946 --> 00:01:12,947
Ready?

15
00:01:15,950 --> 00:01:17,160
Shit.

16
00:01:20,747 --> 00:01:23,708
Damn it.

17
00:01:26,628 --> 00:01:27,712
God damn it...

18
00:01:28,838 --> 00:01:30,924
Son of a bitch.

19
00:01:51,653 --> 00:01:53,530
Killing someone's not easy.

20
00:01:55,031 --> 00:01:56,282
You need experience.

21
00:02:14,968 --> 00:02:19,264
THE WORST OF EVIL

22
00:02:43,705 --> 00:02:47,709
<i>Kwon Seungho graduated from Chudong</i>
<i>Elementary School, which closed in 1984.</i>

23
00:02:47,792 --> 00:02:51,254
He went to Sangun Middle School,
which closed in 1987,

24
00:02:51,337 --> 00:02:53,173
so there aren't any alumni groups.

25
00:02:53,256 --> 00:02:54,883
As for Gwangju Jeil High School,

26
00:02:54,966 --> 00:02:58,595
he dropped out, so his name
isn't in the student records.

27
00:02:59,053 --> 00:03:00,263
Interesting.

28
00:03:00,346 --> 00:03:01,890
Nothing can be verified.

29
00:03:01,973 --> 00:03:03,892
Well, I guess so.

30
00:03:04,434 --> 00:03:05,435
<i>Thanks.</i>

31
00:03:08,146 --> 00:03:09,355
KWON JANGSEOK

32
00:03:09,439 --> 00:03:11,024
CRIMINAL RECORD
WONJU

33
00:03:11,107 --> 00:03:13,735
VIOLATION OF NARCOTICS CONTROL ACT

34
00:03:16,446 --> 00:03:17,614
Boss.

35
00:03:17,864 --> 00:03:21,701
The girl you ran into, Yu Euijeong...

36
00:03:23,161 --> 00:03:25,079
You said she's with SMPA, right?

37
00:03:25,705 --> 00:03:27,540
She's in the Security Division.

38
00:03:27,624 --> 00:03:29,542
What would they look into us for?

39
00:03:29,626 --> 00:03:33,213
Well, that's what she said.

40
00:03:33,296 --> 00:03:37,050
And who's someone she knows? Seungho.

41
00:03:37,133 --> 00:03:40,178
What if she's using him to spy on us?

42
00:03:40,261 --> 00:03:41,763
Then according to you, shit...

43
00:03:41,846 --> 00:03:43,806
we'd already be in prison for murder.

44
00:03:43,890 --> 00:03:46,476
-Am I wrong?
-His father really was a drug addict.

45
00:03:47,685 --> 00:03:48,895
That's why the two met.

46
00:03:49,520 --> 00:03:51,606
So you're leaning toward
that idea, right?

47
00:03:51,689 --> 00:03:54,943
And the Busan guys leaving this behind
was a coincidence too?

48
00:03:55,610 --> 00:03:57,820
Look, Boss.
Ever since Kwon Seungho appeared,

49
00:03:58,029 --> 00:04:01,658
a cop named Yu Euijeong showed up,
and this thing popped up.

50
00:04:01,741 --> 00:04:04,744
And when we were attacked,
he showed up at the perfect time

51
00:04:04,827 --> 00:04:06,162
and took care of things.

52
00:04:06,663 --> 00:04:08,998
-Don't you think that's strange?
-Hey.

53
00:04:09,082 --> 00:04:12,168
He ran into them by coincidence
while on patrol with Yongdae.

54
00:04:12,252 --> 00:04:14,254
See? By coincidence again.

55
00:04:14,712 --> 00:04:17,882
If there are too many coincidences,
shouldn't you be suspicious?

56
00:04:17,966 --> 00:04:20,760
God damn it. What the fuck
do you want us to do?

57
00:04:21,427 --> 00:04:23,054
If one thing's off, it's no good.

58
00:04:23,179 --> 00:04:24,931
Isn't that our rule?

59
00:04:44,242 --> 00:04:45,451
Where are you going?

60
00:04:45,910 --> 00:04:47,203
You can't go out tonight.

61
00:04:47,578 --> 00:04:48,705
Why not?

62
00:04:49,330 --> 00:04:50,331
What?

63
00:04:54,627 --> 00:04:55,712
What did you say?

64
00:04:59,215 --> 00:05:02,135
Nothing, sir.

65
00:05:03,636 --> 00:05:04,637
Understood.

66
00:05:26,534 --> 00:05:27,535
Hey.

67
00:05:31,748 --> 00:05:33,750
Shit, you've been drinking?

68
00:05:36,836 --> 00:05:38,171
Why couldn't you shoot?

69
00:05:44,052 --> 00:05:45,094
I'm sorry.

70
00:05:47,263 --> 00:05:48,306
Hey.

71
00:05:49,140 --> 00:05:51,184
It's okay. You did great.

72
00:05:54,312 --> 00:05:58,900
Just to be sure, though...

73
00:05:58,983 --> 00:06:01,569
You're not going to call the police

74
00:06:01,652 --> 00:06:03,821
because of guilt or some shit, right?

75
00:06:03,905 --> 00:06:05,782
Call the police? Me?

76
00:06:06,240 --> 00:06:09,911
I mean, you're friends
with that policewoman.

77
00:06:09,994 --> 00:06:14,499
I thought maybe you were
going to call her and cry.

78
00:06:14,874 --> 00:06:19,087
"Hey, those bastards told me
to kill someone."

79
00:06:19,504 --> 00:06:22,382
Sir, please stop.
I don't want to hear it.

80
00:06:22,465 --> 00:06:24,926
You think you have a choice, you fuck?

81
00:06:25,426 --> 00:06:26,552
Look.

82
00:06:27,678 --> 00:06:31,182
To wear gold watches on this wrist
instead of handcuffs,

83
00:06:31,265 --> 00:06:33,684
I've been racking my brain
my whole fucking life.

84
00:06:35,019 --> 00:06:38,064
So you're Taeho's cousin. I get it.

85
00:06:41,692 --> 00:06:43,611
But you're not one of us.

86
00:06:46,489 --> 00:06:49,075
What do you mean "one of us"?

87
00:06:51,494 --> 00:06:53,621
What? Is it because I'm not from Gangnam?

88
00:07:04,006 --> 00:07:05,508
Oh, boy.

89
00:07:06,801 --> 00:07:08,428
Chief Seo.

90
00:07:08,511 --> 00:07:09,887
Put him back on patrol.

91
00:07:09,971 --> 00:07:11,264
Sir.

92
00:07:19,814 --> 00:07:20,815
Hey, Kwon Seungho.

93
00:07:21,983 --> 00:07:23,109
Sir?

94
00:07:25,945 --> 00:07:27,613
I'm not from Gangnam either.

95
00:07:37,331 --> 00:07:39,459
If we arrest them for this,

96
00:07:39,625 --> 00:07:41,461
our investigation has to stop.

97
00:07:42,336 --> 00:07:44,338
Let's just identify the victim

98
00:07:44,422 --> 00:07:45,840
and keep this quiet for now.

99
00:07:49,302 --> 00:07:52,930
<i>But didn't Detective Park</i>
<i>cause a huge disturbance among them?</i>

100
00:07:54,390 --> 00:07:56,267
<i>They seem to be suspicious of him again.</i>

101
00:07:57,310 --> 00:07:58,978
<i>We have to gain</i>
<i>their trust back.</i>

102
00:08:01,189 --> 00:08:02,231
Just this once,

103
00:08:02,315 --> 00:08:03,774
we'd like your help.

104
00:08:06,152 --> 00:08:08,029
Just what do you want help with?

105
00:08:08,196 --> 00:08:12,241
Inspector Yu,
you are the only police officer

106
00:08:12,325 --> 00:08:13,743
who can meet Jung Gicheul.

-Here's the list of the companies.
-Okay.

112
00:09:26,399 --> 00:09:27,650
Hello?

113
00:09:27,733 --> 00:09:29,318
<i>Hi, Gicheul. It's me, Euijeong.</i>

114
00:09:33,573 --> 00:09:36,242
<i>I asked Seungho for your number.</i>

115
00:09:36,325 --> 00:09:37,451
I see.

116
00:09:39,870 --> 00:09:41,289
Do you want to grab a drink?

117
00:10:11,569 --> 00:10:12,903
Who are you meeting?

118
00:10:42,933 --> 00:10:44,143
You wait here.

119
00:11:13,923 --> 00:11:15,049
Let's sit down.

120
00:11:19,887 --> 00:11:21,055
What the fuck?

121
00:11:22,765 --> 00:11:25,685
Dohyung, what's going on?

122
00:11:25,768 --> 00:11:27,937
Why is Euijeong meeting Jung Gicheul?

123
00:11:28,020 --> 00:11:29,689
Your wife is helping us.

124
00:11:29,772 --> 00:11:31,148
With what?

125
00:11:31,232 --> 00:11:33,359
She's going to tell Jung Gicheul

126
00:11:33,901 --> 00:11:37,071
that he can trust Kwon Seungho
and it's okay to keep him close.

127
00:11:37,196 --> 00:11:38,698
Why does Euijeong have to...

128
00:11:40,241 --> 00:11:42,743
This investigation we're doing
is dangerous.

129
00:11:43,452 --> 00:11:44,954
Why drag Euijeong into this?

130
00:11:45,037 --> 00:11:46,580
This isn't right.

131
00:11:47,248 --> 00:11:48,708
She agreed to do this.

132
00:11:48,791 --> 00:11:50,501
-Dohyung.
-Listen.

133
00:11:50,584 --> 00:11:52,795
We didn't ask your wife to do this.

134
00:11:52,878 --> 00:11:55,506
We asked
the talented Inspector Yu Euijeong

135
00:11:55,589 --> 00:11:57,508
of SMPA's Security Division for help.

136
00:11:59,176 --> 00:12:03,639
Junmo, I think
we can rely on Inspector Yu.

137
00:12:13,023 --> 00:12:15,401
How did you know my mom was ill?

138
00:12:15,484 --> 00:12:16,986
I know a guy with the police.

139
00:12:19,905 --> 00:12:21,532
When I ran into you that day,

140
00:12:22,908 --> 00:12:24,827
it was so unexpected,
and I was rude.

141
00:12:25,244 --> 00:12:26,245
No, you weren't.

142
00:12:27,329 --> 00:12:30,875
By the way, you've become
even more handsome.

143
00:12:34,837 --> 00:12:36,046
Ta-da.

144
00:12:40,301 --> 00:12:42,011
You still have this?

145
00:12:42,094 --> 00:12:45,556
I thought I should give it to you someday.

146
00:12:47,183 --> 00:12:48,225
Euijeong.

147
00:12:51,020 --> 00:12:52,188
Do you remember?

148
00:13:03,032 --> 00:13:04,116
Do you like it?

149
00:13:04,617 --> 00:13:05,743
Yeah.

150
00:13:05,993 --> 00:13:08,245
If you find something nice
at the church shop,

151
00:13:08,329 --> 00:13:09,497
get one for me too.

152
00:13:09,580 --> 00:13:11,707
I'll get you something even better.

153
00:13:11,791 --> 00:13:13,167
Something more expensive.

154
00:13:13,417 --> 00:13:14,752
When?

155
00:13:19,423 --> 00:13:20,591
-Hold on.
-What's wrong?

156
00:13:38,192 --> 00:13:39,985
What do you think
would've happened to us

157
00:13:40,069 --> 00:13:41,403
if it wasn't for my mother?

158
00:13:52,790 --> 00:13:54,416
I hope you're being nice to Seungho.

159
00:13:59,004 --> 00:14:01,423
He's been through a lot
since he was a kid.

160
00:14:01,507 --> 00:14:03,092
Please take good care of him.

161
00:14:12,351 --> 00:14:14,478
It must be hard
taking care of your mother.

162
00:14:14,854 --> 00:14:15,980
It's okay.

163
00:14:16,772 --> 00:14:18,858
I'll try to stop by whenever I'm free.

164
00:14:18,983 --> 00:14:21,193
Thanks, but it's really fine.

165
00:14:21,277 --> 00:14:22,695
You're busy too.

166
00:14:26,615 --> 00:14:30,995
By the way, does your husband
ever visit your mother?

167
00:14:32,746 --> 00:14:37,167
The caregiver thought
that I was her son-in-law.

168
00:14:45,426 --> 00:14:47,094
If he brings up your husband,

169
00:14:47,177 --> 00:14:48,512
just say you had a divorce

170
00:14:49,597 --> 00:14:51,473
and end it there.

171
00:14:55,102 --> 00:14:56,604
Actually, I got divorced.

172
00:14:58,731 --> 00:15:01,650
But only some of my family know about it.

173
00:15:02,443 --> 00:15:03,736
Everyone I know is a cop,

174
00:15:03,819 --> 00:15:06,572
so I was afraid it'd spread
and cause a mess.

175
00:15:08,073 --> 00:15:09,992
I didn't even tell my mom either.

176
00:15:15,414 --> 00:15:18,042
Well, things happen in life.

177
00:15:19,084 --> 00:15:20,085
It's okay.

178
00:15:27,134 --> 00:15:29,345
Did you know Euijeong
had a divorce?

179
00:15:29,428 --> 00:15:30,471
No, I didn't.

180
00:15:33,015 --> 00:15:34,850
Don't tell the others I met Euijeong.

181
00:15:35,851 --> 00:15:38,562
We've known her
since we were young, so we're fine.

182
00:15:39,688 --> 00:15:41,482
But it'll bother the other guys.

183
00:15:42,232 --> 00:15:43,400
She's a cop, after all.

184
00:15:44,652 --> 00:15:46,612
Yes, Boss.

185
00:15:48,197 --> 00:15:49,198
Welcome back, Boss.

186
00:16:03,629 --> 00:16:05,756
And I think I'll see her often
from now on,

187
00:16:06,465 --> 00:16:07,675
so keep that in mind.

188
00:16:10,010 --> 00:16:11,136
Yes, Boss.

189
00:16:12,346 --> 00:16:14,014
That's enough patrolling for now.

190
00:16:56,265 --> 00:16:57,683
Hello?

191
00:17:01,270 --> 00:17:02,396
Hi, Dad.

192
00:17:07,735 --> 00:17:08,777
Okay.

193
00:17:49,318 --> 00:17:50,319
Kwon Seungho.

194
00:17:51,820 --> 00:17:52,821
Yes, Boss.

195
00:18:00,954 --> 00:18:02,039
Get dressed.

196
00:18:03,874 --> 00:18:05,626
What's going on, sir?

197
00:18:06,085 --> 00:18:08,128
Euijeong's mother has passed away.

198
00:18:23,102 --> 00:18:28,398
FUNERAL HALL

199
00:18:59,388 --> 00:19:00,931
Wait, Boss.

200
00:19:02,141 --> 00:19:03,142
I've been thinking,

201
00:19:03,225 --> 00:19:05,394
and I think you should go by yourself.

202
00:19:06,520 --> 00:19:10,023
I think it'll look better to go in alone

203
00:19:10,107 --> 00:19:11,608
to comfort Euijeong.

204
00:19:11,692 --> 00:19:14,903
I can pay my respects
on my own later.

205
00:19:26,039 --> 00:19:29,543
MAY YOU REST IN PEACE
JUNG GICHEUL

206
00:20:03,118 --> 00:20:04,203
Are you okay?

207
00:20:18,842 --> 00:20:20,802
We used to attend the same church.

208
00:20:20,886 --> 00:20:22,471
He knew Mom well too.

209
00:20:41,198 --> 00:20:43,450
-This is my wife.
-Hello.

210
00:20:47,829 --> 00:20:49,248
Thanks for coming.

211
00:20:51,291 --> 00:20:53,919
I'm sure she's resting
in heaven right now.

212
00:21:06,181 --> 00:21:08,350
How did you know?
I didn't even contact you.

213
00:21:09,893 --> 00:21:12,604
I told you. I know someone
with the police.

214
00:21:19,987 --> 00:21:21,571
Thanks for coming too, Seungho.

215
00:21:26,660 --> 00:21:27,661
Sure.

216
00:21:31,248 --> 00:21:32,749
Uncle.

217
00:21:33,458 --> 00:21:35,460
Can you solve this for me?

218
00:21:56,773 --> 00:21:58,358
Uncle's here.

219
00:21:58,442 --> 00:22:00,736
Let's go solve it.

220
00:22:08,160 --> 00:22:09,953
EUMSEONG POLICE STATION
DETECTIVE PARK JUNMO

221
00:22:12,914 --> 00:22:16,251
Gicheul, why don't we go out
and get some fresh air?

222
00:22:16,960 --> 00:22:17,961
Sure.

223
00:22:25,302 --> 00:22:28,847
It breaks my heart to see you alone.

224
00:22:30,307 --> 00:22:31,767
You shouldn't be lonely.

225
00:22:34,936 --> 00:22:36,980
It makes me resent your husband.

226
00:22:38,732 --> 00:22:40,442
He finally shows up now?

227
00:22:48,200 --> 00:22:49,201
This is my husband.

228
00:22:51,536 --> 00:22:52,746
And this is my church friend.

229
00:22:53,163 --> 00:22:55,540
I've met her church friends
at our wedding

230
00:22:55,624 --> 00:22:56,917
and housewarming party.

231
00:22:57,793 --> 00:22:59,252
But I haven't met you before.

232
00:23:13,475 --> 00:23:15,185
Seeing that you came immediately,

233
00:23:15,602 --> 00:23:17,604
you must be a really close friend.

234
00:23:18,271 --> 00:23:21,066
I visited her mother
at the hospital a few days ago.

235
00:23:21,483 --> 00:23:23,652
And she told me

236
00:23:25,070 --> 00:23:29,032
she liked her son-in-law
more than her two sons.

237
00:23:33,495 --> 00:23:36,206
When was the last time
you visited her in the hospital?

238
00:23:38,208 --> 00:23:41,211
I know you're divorced,
but did it ever cross your mind

239
00:23:41,294 --> 00:23:44,339
that she wanted to see her son-in-law
before she passed away?

240
00:23:51,888 --> 00:23:54,307
Honestly, do you even have
the right to mourn?

241
00:23:55,016 --> 00:23:56,017
Gicheul, stop.

242
00:23:58,311 --> 00:23:59,312
Hey.

243
00:24:00,480 --> 00:24:03,024
You don't talk about
another family's business,

244
00:24:03,108 --> 00:24:05,110
especially if it's the grieving family.

245
00:24:05,193 --> 00:24:06,778
You should stop too.

246
00:24:15,495 --> 00:24:18,415
Guests are still coming,
so wrap it up and come back in.

247
00:24:39,519 --> 00:24:40,520
I'll get going.

248
00:24:41,313 --> 00:24:42,647
Thanks for coming.

249
00:24:44,191 --> 00:24:45,442
You too, Seungho.

250
00:24:49,488 --> 00:24:51,114
I'll pray a lot for your mother.

251
00:24:57,746 --> 00:24:59,706
If things get tough, call me anytime.

252
00:25:32,697 --> 00:25:34,991
I'm going to use the restroom.

253
00:25:48,463 --> 00:25:49,464
Junmo.

254
00:25:49,965 --> 00:25:51,007
Hey, Junmo!

255
00:25:52,676 --> 00:25:54,261
Why didn't you report to us?

256
00:25:57,681 --> 00:26:01,977
I should at least pay my last respects
to my mother-in-law.

257
00:26:08,650 --> 00:26:11,820
Do you want to give up
on our operation here?

258
00:26:15,574 --> 00:26:16,866
I'm really sorry, Junmo.

259
00:26:17,826 --> 00:26:18,827
I will...

260
00:26:20,328 --> 00:26:22,622
I will stay until she's laid to rest.

261
00:26:22,914 --> 00:26:24,082
God damn it.

262
00:26:24,708 --> 00:26:26,835
I'm really sorry.

263
00:27:06,249 --> 00:27:08,335
Does the food taste all right?

264
00:27:08,960 --> 00:27:13,131
Yes, ma'am. It's delicious.

265
00:27:17,052 --> 00:27:18,345
How's work?

266
00:27:18,637 --> 00:27:24,100
It's good. I'm just trying to do my best.

267
00:27:25,518 --> 00:27:29,022
Of course, you should.
Be confident.

268
00:27:29,105 --> 00:27:31,024
-I will.
-Do what you have to do...

269
00:27:31,107 --> 00:27:32,567
-Yes.
-...and what you want to do.

270
00:27:32,651 --> 00:27:33,735
Yes, ma'am.

271
00:27:34,402 --> 00:27:36,529
Euijeong's father and brothers disapprove,

272
00:27:36,613 --> 00:27:38,114
but don't worry about it.

273
00:27:42,744 --> 00:27:45,997
Euijeong really likes you, Junmo.

274
00:27:46,414 --> 00:27:49,042
And I like seeing you smile.

275
00:27:49,709 --> 00:27:51,586
That's what's important, right?

276
00:27:57,509 --> 00:28:00,220
As we share laughs and time together,

277
00:28:00,303 --> 00:28:01,805
we'll become family.

278
00:28:03,306 --> 00:28:04,391
Yes.

279
00:28:04,474 --> 00:28:05,600
Thank you.

280
00:28:43,346 --> 00:28:47,058
Seungho, do you keep up
with how your mother's doing?

281
00:28:51,354 --> 00:28:52,355
Yes.

282
00:28:53,606 --> 00:28:58,361
I heard she had a baby
with some dude,

283
00:28:59,821 --> 00:29:01,573
and she's living a happy life.

284
00:29:04,242 --> 00:29:06,453
You don't resent her
for not looking for you?

285
00:29:06,536 --> 00:29:07,537
Resent her?

286
00:29:08,288 --> 00:29:09,581
I'm not sure.

287
00:29:12,417 --> 00:29:13,418
Even if it was me,

288
00:29:15,336 --> 00:29:18,214
I would've hated
to even think about our family.

289
00:29:24,721 --> 00:29:25,722
Damn it.

290
00:29:26,765 --> 00:29:31,853
My father would beat my mother so much.

291
00:29:33,855 --> 00:29:37,275
So in high school, I ran away from home
with my sibling and mother.

292
00:29:39,360 --> 00:29:41,571
I said I'd kill him
if he tried to find us.

293
00:29:45,200 --> 00:29:46,618
But that asshole...

294
00:29:49,037 --> 00:29:50,580
he came looking with no fear.

295
00:29:55,251 --> 00:29:56,419
So he was killed.

296
00:30:02,509 --> 00:30:04,177
Not by me. By my mother.

297
00:30:16,397 --> 00:30:17,607
Boss.

298
00:30:21,778 --> 00:30:23,488
I want to be successful.

299
00:30:26,282 --> 00:30:27,367
At first,

300
00:30:28,076 --> 00:30:31,037
I came to work for you
just to get revenge for Taeho.

301
00:30:33,248 --> 00:30:34,249
But now,

302
00:30:37,544 --> 00:30:39,963
I want to be successful like you.

303
00:30:41,589 --> 00:30:43,800
I don't want to live
as a drug addict's son.

304
00:30:44,509 --> 00:30:45,510
Hear me?

305
00:30:45,593 --> 00:30:46,886
In Gangnam...

306
00:30:48,179 --> 00:30:50,056
The man who made it in Gangnam,

307
00:30:52,892 --> 00:30:54,310
Kwon Seungho.

308
00:30:56,980 --> 00:30:58,606
That's who I want to be.

309
00:31:09,784 --> 00:31:10,827
I'll help you.

310
00:31:12,412 --> 00:31:13,580
Please help me, Boss.

311
00:31:16,332 --> 00:31:18,167
But you have to do something for me.

312
00:31:18,251 --> 00:31:22,255
Sure, I'll do anything.

313
00:31:22,338 --> 00:31:23,339
What is it?

314
00:31:26,718 --> 00:31:28,845
To make sure things
work out with Euijeong,

315
00:31:30,013 --> 00:31:31,639
I need your help.

316
00:31:33,349 --> 00:31:34,350
And your support.

317
00:32:06,716 --> 00:32:10,011
Okay, sir. I will.

318
00:32:15,224 --> 00:32:16,225
I'll help you.

319
00:32:25,818 --> 00:32:26,945
Boss.

320
00:32:27,278 --> 00:32:28,321
You see,

321
00:32:29,322 --> 00:32:32,158
I'd ride on boats
in the Pacific for a year at a time.

322
00:32:33,284 --> 00:32:34,953
But it's felt a bit stifling,

323
00:32:35,912 --> 00:32:37,622
and I miss the smell of the ocean.

324
00:32:40,416 --> 00:32:42,585
When you go on your next fishing trip,

325
00:32:45,213 --> 00:32:46,923
could you take me with you?

326
00:32:47,256 --> 00:32:48,883
Just like that photo over there,

327
00:32:49,801 --> 00:32:52,428
I want to go fishing with you.

328
00:32:56,975 --> 00:32:59,686
It's a hobby for us three at the top.

329
00:33:00,979 --> 00:33:02,689
And you already want to join?

330
00:33:09,862 --> 00:33:12,907
Well, why not?

331
00:33:13,157 --> 00:33:14,158
Well...

332
00:33:15,159 --> 00:33:17,620
Didn't Euijeong ask you
to take good care of me?

333
00:33:21,249 --> 00:33:22,875
Please let me join you.

334
00:33:30,174 --> 00:33:31,634
We'll play it by ear.

335
00:33:36,222 --> 00:33:37,223
Okay, Boss.

336
00:33:46,566 --> 00:33:47,734
Thank you, sir.

337
00:33:55,116 --> 00:33:56,117
Boss.

338
00:33:57,827 --> 00:33:59,287
I'll do my best.

339
00:34:10,465 --> 00:34:11,924
<i>To call, press one.</i>

340
00:34:12,008 --> 00:34:13,092
<i>To leave a message,</i>

341
00:34:13,176 --> 00:34:14,969
<i>press two.</i>

342
00:34:16,012 --> 00:34:18,181
<i>Please, leave your message.</i>

343
00:34:19,057 --> 00:34:20,308
Hey, Euijeong.

344
00:34:24,562 --> 00:34:25,563
It's me.

345
00:34:29,067 --> 00:34:30,985
Euijeong, I'm so sorry.

346
00:34:33,029 --> 00:34:35,573
I'm so sorry I couldn't visit your mother.

347
00:34:41,996 --> 00:34:43,247
I'm just...

348
00:34:45,458 --> 00:34:49,212
I'm so sorry for causing such a mess.

349
00:35:01,432 --> 00:35:05,812
And I'm sorry for being so foolish.

350
00:35:08,314 --> 00:35:09,524
And...

351
00:35:13,319 --> 00:35:15,113
And I'm just...

352
00:35:17,073 --> 00:35:18,991
I'm sorry I'm not good enough.

353
00:35:28,918 --> 00:35:30,503
I'm just sorry for everything.

354
00:35:35,216 --> 00:35:36,384
I'm sorry.

355
00:35:40,221 --> 00:35:41,430
Euijeong.

356
00:35:48,855 --> 00:35:50,064
I love you.

357
00:36:04,912 --> 00:36:06,289
Anyone got a lighter?

358
00:36:25,892 --> 00:36:27,143
I'm good, sir.

359
00:36:35,276 --> 00:36:36,277
It's hard, isn't it?

360
00:36:36,903 --> 00:36:39,071
You always have to follow Boss's schedule,

361
00:36:39,864 --> 00:36:43,409
and at night, you don't have a store
of your own to hang out in.

362
00:36:44,660 --> 00:36:45,703
It's okay, sir.

363
00:36:47,371 --> 00:36:48,664
Don't worry.

364
00:36:48,748 --> 00:36:49,874
Around next spring,

365
00:36:49,957 --> 00:36:52,418
Boss will probably give you
a store to run.

366
00:36:52,710 --> 00:36:53,961
Thank you, sir.

367
00:36:55,880 --> 00:36:58,925
You look cute when you smile.

368
00:37:00,426 --> 00:37:01,802
-Seungho.
-Yes, sir?

369
00:37:02,386 --> 00:37:03,471
I'm younger than you,

370
00:37:03,554 --> 00:37:06,057
but doesn't it bother you
that I speak casually?

371
00:37:07,350 --> 00:37:08,851
No. It's okay, sir.

372
00:37:08,935 --> 00:37:10,019
Is that so?

373
00:37:11,938 --> 00:37:13,940
What did you do with Boss yesterday?

374
00:37:14,523 --> 00:37:16,359
Where did you go?

375
00:37:18,945 --> 00:37:20,613
Didn't Boss tell you about it?

376
00:37:23,199 --> 00:37:24,367
He did.

377
00:37:24,450 --> 00:37:25,534
What did he say?

378
00:37:30,748 --> 00:37:32,541
Do I have to tell you

379
00:37:32,625 --> 00:37:34,418
what Boss said to me?

380
00:37:38,381 --> 00:37:41,592
He told me everything, so you can tell me.

381
00:37:48,724 --> 00:37:50,309
We went to Taeho's columbarium.

382
00:38:01,070 --> 00:38:05,241
Well, why does that have to be
such a big secret?

383
00:38:05,366 --> 00:38:09,495
You should always tell me
about things like that. Okay?

384
00:38:37,398 --> 00:38:38,649
Thank you, sir.

385
00:38:38,733 --> 00:38:41,360
For doing it for me the other night.

386
00:38:48,492 --> 00:38:53,289
I hope we can continue to get along.

387
00:38:59,587 --> 00:39:01,047
Choose who you follow wisely.

388
00:39:03,549 --> 00:39:05,051
I guess I will, sir.

389
00:39:07,595 --> 00:39:10,514
Since we're both not from Gangnam, right?

390
00:39:18,898 --> 00:39:21,609
It seemed the higher-ups had
a way of making big money.

391
00:39:23,152 --> 00:39:24,820
We should figure that out soon too.

392
00:39:26,364 --> 00:39:27,573
We should, sir.

393
00:40:15,204 --> 00:40:16,414
JAEGEON LOGISTICS

394
00:40:19,417 --> 00:40:20,960
Oh, I was going to fold.

395
00:40:21,043 --> 00:40:23,087
- Sorry.
- Stay focused.

396
00:40:23,170 --> 00:40:24,672
I'll raise.

397
00:40:25,923 --> 00:40:28,008
You're going bet?
You got nothing.

398
00:40:28,884 --> 00:40:30,177
I'll bet and see.

399
00:40:30,803 --> 00:40:31,971
Who are you?

400
00:40:32,680 --> 00:40:33,889
Who the hell are you?

401
00:40:33,973 --> 00:40:35,433
Is that Kang Geon from Busan?

402
00:40:36,434 --> 00:40:38,811
Hi, Geon. Did you come by yourself?

403
00:40:44,942 --> 00:40:46,026
What brings you here?

404
00:40:53,284 --> 00:40:54,743
Let's start a war together.

405
00:41:05,087 --> 00:41:06,088
Is that me?

406
00:41:07,131 --> 00:41:09,091
I've never seen this bastard before.

407
00:41:09,175 --> 00:41:10,176
What?

408
00:41:11,844 --> 00:41:14,221
I think this photo was edited.

409
00:41:15,014 --> 00:41:18,058
What asshole did this?

410
00:41:18,142 --> 00:41:22,062
What kind of crazy bastard
would dare to make such a thing?

411
00:41:22,146 --> 00:41:23,772
Jung Gicheul of Gangnam Union.

412
00:41:25,483 --> 00:41:27,026
Help me out

413
00:41:27,109 --> 00:41:29,111
and take Nonhyeon-dong and Yeoksam-dong.

414
00:41:38,120 --> 00:41:39,163
Nice.

415
00:41:40,456 --> 00:41:41,457
What the hell?

416
00:41:44,919 --> 00:41:45,920
You know me, right?

417
00:41:46,879 --> 00:41:47,880
We need to talk.

418
00:41:47,963 --> 00:41:50,090
-You fucking...
-Hey, wait.

419
00:41:50,174 --> 00:41:52,134
I wasn't finished talking.

420
00:41:54,553 --> 00:41:55,763
Have you guys eaten yet?

421
00:41:55,846 --> 00:41:58,182
When you play pool,
Chinese food's the best.

422
00:42:03,938 --> 00:42:05,147
I can buy you some.

423
00:42:06,190 --> 00:42:07,775
-How much?
-It's 18,000 won.

424
00:42:07,900 --> 00:42:08,984
-It's 18,000?
-Yes.

425
00:42:09,985 --> 00:42:11,111
Hold on.

426
00:42:15,616 --> 00:42:17,493
You're in Gangnam Cartel, aren't you?

427
00:42:17,910 --> 00:42:18,953
What do you want?

428
00:42:23,249 --> 00:42:24,625
Nice to meet you.

429
00:42:29,380 --> 00:42:32,091
Without any elders in the organization,

430
00:42:32,216 --> 00:42:34,927
everyone's around people of the same age,

431
00:42:35,010 --> 00:42:37,221
so that must cause a lot of conflicts.

432
00:42:39,890 --> 00:42:41,809
Since you're so successful,

433
00:42:41,892 --> 00:42:44,186
my boss wants to speak with you.

434
00:42:48,315 --> 00:42:50,651
You're doing well for yourself, young man.

435
00:42:50,734 --> 00:42:51,944
This is a nice bar.

436
00:42:56,824 --> 00:42:59,785
But how long do you think
you can maintain such a rich life?

437
00:43:00,244 --> 00:43:02,371
Imagine yourself in two, three,

438
00:43:02,871 --> 00:43:04,873
and even 10 years.

439
00:43:05,833 --> 00:43:07,418
Nothing's going to change.

440
00:43:09,211 --> 00:43:12,047
You'll still have to bow down
to people your age,

441
00:43:12,381 --> 00:43:14,341
and you'll still be looked down on.

442
00:43:16,010 --> 00:43:18,554
This entire gang is abnormal.

443
00:43:19,179 --> 00:43:21,432
It all depends on one guy,
Jung Gicheul,

444
00:43:21,515 --> 00:43:22,850
and his charisma.

445
00:43:24,810 --> 00:43:28,063
What will you do
if he gets stabbed to death one day?

446
00:43:28,147 --> 00:43:30,441
Our gang controls 50% of Seoul,

447
00:43:31,400 --> 00:43:33,819
and we're willing to take you in.

448
00:43:36,113 --> 00:43:40,868
We're a nationwide organization
that's rapidly expanding.

449
00:43:42,244 --> 00:43:44,413
You're not the only one

450
00:43:44,496 --> 00:43:45,748
we're trying to recruit.

451
00:43:47,333 --> 00:43:50,711
Even if you turn us down,
someone will take our offer and join us.

452
00:43:51,629 --> 00:43:52,963
So think wisely.

453
00:43:53,964 --> 00:43:56,634
For the time being,
all you have to do for us is

454
00:43:57,509 --> 00:43:59,803
checking what Jung Gicheul is up to,

455
00:44:00,888 --> 00:44:03,307
where he's going,
and with who.

456
00:44:04,266 --> 00:44:08,228
Just tell us about those things
in real time.

457
00:44:16,445 --> 00:44:18,030
-Fuck, I'm screwed.
-Hey.

458
00:44:18,489 --> 00:44:21,241
Gicheul, I need to go to the hospital now.

459
00:44:22,034 --> 00:44:23,827
Hyeok was sent to the ER.

460
00:44:23,911 --> 00:44:26,163
Fuck, they said it's vaginal bleeding.

461
00:44:26,246 --> 00:44:27,706
What if it hurts the baby?

462
00:44:27,790 --> 00:44:28,957
What are you saying?

463
00:44:29,124 --> 00:44:32,419
I don't think I can go fishing tomorrow.
You two go without me.

464
00:44:32,503 --> 00:44:33,671
-Hey...
-I'm really sorry.

465
00:44:33,754 --> 00:44:34,838
Hey, wait.

466
00:44:36,048 --> 00:44:37,091
Call us.

467
00:44:37,633 --> 00:44:38,884
Fuck...

468
00:44:40,219 --> 00:44:44,598
Boss, I don't think
just the two of us can do it.

469
00:44:44,682 --> 00:44:48,102
We'll need at least one person
to keep watch at the port.

470
00:44:51,146 --> 00:44:52,898
Let's bring one of the guys.

471
00:44:52,981 --> 00:44:54,733
-We won't tell him what we're doing.
-Okay.

472
00:44:54,817 --> 00:44:56,902
-We'll make him wait at the port.
-Got it.

473
00:44:56,985 --> 00:45:00,114
I'll get Chief Seo ready then.

474
00:45:00,614 --> 00:45:01,615
Seungho.

475
00:45:04,618 --> 00:45:06,328
Come on, Boss. Don't be like this.

476
00:45:07,079 --> 00:45:08,997
I said we wouldn't tell him about it.

477
00:45:14,628 --> 00:45:16,588
Still, it's too soon for him.

478
00:45:21,301 --> 00:45:22,636
Jungbae.

479
00:45:22,720 --> 00:45:24,138
Yes, Boss.

480
00:45:24,847 --> 00:45:26,306
If we take Seungho with us,

481
00:45:27,599 --> 00:45:29,476
we'll be able to see

482
00:45:30,811 --> 00:45:32,229
if he brings a cop or not.

483
00:45:33,647 --> 00:45:35,482
All right, Boss.

484
00:45:41,864 --> 00:45:42,865
Kwon Seungho.

485
00:45:43,282 --> 00:45:44,366
-Sir?
-Did you wash up?

486
00:45:44,450 --> 00:45:45,451
Yes, sir.

487
00:45:45,534 --> 00:45:47,286
Don't drink tonight. Go to bed early.

488
00:45:47,786 --> 00:45:49,580
Is something up, sir?

489
00:45:50,122 --> 00:45:52,291
Again with the fucking questions.

490
00:45:53,917 --> 00:45:55,919
We're fishing tomorrow, so get ready.

491
00:45:56,837 --> 00:45:59,047
Yes, sir. I understand.

492
00:47:01,485 --> 00:47:04,196
May I ask why we changed cars?

493
00:47:07,950 --> 00:47:09,868
To make sure we're not being followed?

494
00:47:19,837 --> 00:47:23,382
Is it even possible to to go fishing
in the middle of the night?

495
00:47:33,517 --> 00:47:35,227
-Hello?
<i>-Hi, Boss.</i>

496
00:47:35,310 --> 00:47:38,605
I got a flat tire, so I'm stuck here.

497
00:47:38,689 --> 00:47:39,690
I apologize.

498
00:47:40,232 --> 00:47:43,068
<i>Man, that skid almost killed me.</i>

499
00:47:44,403 --> 00:47:47,948
I'm going to call for help.

500
00:47:49,157 --> 00:47:50,784
Could you go on ahead first?

501
00:47:52,160 --> 00:47:53,245
All right.

502
00:48:18,312 --> 00:48:19,438
What the hell?

503
00:48:19,980 --> 00:48:21,523
I'll let them go ahead.

504
00:48:56,391 --> 00:48:57,559
Fuck.

505
00:49:10,697 --> 00:49:12,240
-Just step on it!
-Damn it.

506
00:49:41,353 --> 00:49:42,437
Fucking hell!

507
00:49:42,938 --> 00:49:44,147
That fucker!

508
00:49:48,193 --> 00:49:49,194
Fuck!

509
00:49:55,993 --> 00:49:57,119
Are you all right?

510
00:50:00,372 --> 00:50:02,457
What the fuck is going on?

511
00:50:03,166 --> 00:50:04,209
Come on. Go.

512
00:50:08,880 --> 00:50:09,881
Hurry! Move!

513
00:50:14,344 --> 00:50:15,387
Over there!

514
00:50:16,179 --> 00:50:17,222
Boss!

515
00:50:19,391 --> 00:50:20,767
You motherfuckers!

516
00:50:33,238 --> 00:50:34,740
Motherfucker!

517
00:50:38,326 --> 00:50:39,369
Let go of me!

518
00:50:39,494 --> 00:50:40,912
Get them!

519
00:50:53,925 --> 00:50:54,926
Hurry up!

520
00:50:55,010 --> 00:50:56,303
Fucking hell!

521
00:50:56,386 --> 00:50:58,055
Quickly!
