00:22:51,078 --> 00:22:54,748
I'd really appreciate
your cooperation, Commissioner.

185
00:22:55,123 --> 00:22:56,249
Let's toast.

186
00:23:03,799 --> 00:23:05,634
If we don't trade with the Japanese,

187
00:23:05,717 --> 00:23:08,011
will we have to sell off all 16 kilograms?

188
00:23:08,136 --> 00:23:11,223
Hey, you saw how they cleaned out
Tae-ho Rock Cafe last time.

189
00:23:11,848 --> 00:23:14,059
Selling just a kilogram
in Gangnam is already risky.

190
00:23:14,142 --> 00:23:18,146
You can't sell all 16 kilograms of it here
unless you're crazy.

191
00:23:18,230 --> 00:23:20,816
We can think about that later.

192
00:23:21,149 --> 00:23:23,443
All of us could have died yesterday.

193
00:23:23,527 --> 00:23:26,947
I want my apology
from that son of a bitch Kanemoto.

194
00:23:27,864 --> 00:23:32,077
All our boys know
Yu Euijeong is a cop now.

195
00:23:32,160 --> 00:23:33,620
What should we tell them?

196
00:23:33,703 --> 00:23:34,788
Tell them the truth.

197
00:23:35,664 --> 00:23:37,124
Say they don't need to worry.

198
00:23:37,916 --> 00:23:39,418
Boss.

199
00:23:40,168 --> 00:23:42,879
Can I first meet with
the Japanese at the hotel?

200
00:23:42,963 --> 00:23:44,631
Didn't you hear what I just said?

201
00:23:45,549 --> 00:23:49,136
When you get rid of a rat,
you show it the way out.

202
00:23:49,219 --> 00:23:52,264
Shouldn't someone go to the Japanese
and ease the tension a bit

203
00:23:52,639 --> 00:23:55,225
so they can explain things right
to their boss?

204
00:23:55,308 --> 00:23:58,103
This is about Boss's pride.
Who cares about that?

205
00:23:58,186 --> 00:24:00,981
Pride doesn't pay the bills.

206
00:24:01,606 --> 00:24:03,525
We caused a major ruckus

207
00:24:03,608 --> 00:24:05,777
and took over all of Gangnam overnight.

208
00:24:06,611 --> 00:24:09,281
All eyes are on us right now.

209
00:24:10,490 --> 00:24:13,410
The only way
to sell off the stuff quietly is

210
00:24:13,493 --> 00:24:15,120
through those fucking Japanese.

211
00:24:16,496 --> 00:24:19,499
Getting an apology
and continuing the trade.

212
00:24:19,583 --> 00:24:22,043
Shouldn't we try to do both?

213
00:24:23,128 --> 00:24:27,549
Boss, this is business.

214
00:24:33,638 --> 00:24:35,265

218
00:24:43,356 --> 00:24:45,275
Come out or I'll break the door down.

219
00:24:47,027 --> 00:24:48,111
Man,

220
00:24:48,987 --> 00:24:51,114
I wonder who your backers are,

221
00:24:51,198 --> 00:24:54,618
because everyone's trying
to keep the knife fight quiet.

222
00:24:55,327 --> 00:24:57,078
Did you go to Korea Military Academy?

223
00:24:58,413 --> 00:25:02,501
So did you give a lot of condolence money
at Mr. Cheon's funeral?

225

So...

226
00:25:07,756 --> 00:25:11,718
I got the call log
from the late Mr. Cheon's office.

227
00:25:12,802 --> 00:25:15,305
Who was the last person
he talked with on the phone?

228
00:25:17,140 --> 00:25:20,352
It was fucking you, Jung Gicheul.

229
00:25:21,061 --> 00:25:22,062
What do you think?

230
00:25:30,445 --> 00:25:32,614
I asked him to investigate something.

231
00:25:33,615 --> 00:25:34,991
Is that wrong?

232
00:25:35,075 --> 00:25:40,872
Well, it's not wrong.
It's just fucking scary.

233
00:25:41,540 --> 00:25:44,292
After the phone call with you,
Mr. Cheon died.

234
00:25:44,918 --> 00:25:47,712
Your fellow graduate and drug dealer
Yankees went missing.

235
00:25:48,213 --> 00:25:50,340
And his rival Manager Cho died.

236
00:25:51,216 --> 00:25:52,467
At this point,

237
00:25:52,551 --> 00:25:54,261
it is reasonable to suspect

238
00:25:54,344 --> 00:25:57,889

vending machine around you.

You know what else is fucking strange?

244
00:26:20,870 --> 00:26:23,331
Mr. Cheon's phone is missing.

245
00:26:25,875 --> 00:26:27,669
Did his client take it?

246
00:26:30,380 --> 00:26:33,216
Or did Yankees take it?

247
00:26:34,384 --> 00:26:36,177
Find the lighter's owner and ask him.

248
00:26:38,138 --> 00:26:40,223
I guess that will do.

Why did you chase Mr. Cheon,
whom your boss hired, to the roof?

Also, why did you take his phone?

362
00:33:44,981 --> 00:33:46,274
He's locked up right now.

363
00:33:46,357 --> 00:33:47,859
In Seongdong Detention Center.

364
00:33:48,526 --> 00:33:49,652
In a detention center?

365
00:33:51,779 --> 00:33:53,114
PERSONAL INFORMATION

366
00:33:54,532 --> 00:33:55,658
Hey!

367
00:33:56,409 --> 00:33:57,410
Dodgers!

368
00:33:58,745 --> 00:33:59,787
Who are you?

369
00:33:59,871 --> 00:34:00,913
Mmm.

370
00:34:02,373 --> 00:34:04,250
Here.

371
00:34:05,084 --> 00:34:06,711
- "Hwang Mingoo"?
- Yeah.

372
00:34:07,420 --> 00:34:08,421
I'm Mingoo.

373
00:34:10,715 --> 00:34:12,008
Want a cigarette?

374
00:34:12,091 --> 00:34:14,427
Here. Have a smoke.

375
00:34:17,472 --> 00:34:21,642
Calling me by my name is rude though.
I'm a fucking detective.

376
00:34:21,726 --> 00:34:24,854
What brings you here, Detective?

377
00:34:24,937 --> 00:34:26,773
Gangnam Crystal.

378
00:34:27,523 --> 00:34:28,566
What?

379
00:34:28,649 --> 00:34:30,818
Let's see.

380
00:34:30,902 --> 00:34:33,154
Jeez. 500 grams of meth?

381
00:34:33,237 --> 00:34:35,573
That's 10 years in prison at least.

382
00:34:36,157 --> 00:34:37,283
You're screwed.

383
00:34:37,617 --> 00:34:40,661
Mingoo, I was only selling it.

384
00:34:41,079 --> 00:34:45,166
I know, you idiot. That's why I came here.

385
00:34:47,210 --> 00:34:50,254
Ah. Simply selling drugs

386
00:34:50,338 --> 00:34:52,173
and possessing only a hundredth of it.

387
00:34:52,840 --> 00:34:54,008
Five grams.

388
00:34:54,842 --> 00:34:56,969
Fuck, isn't that just a petty crime?

389
00:34:57,929 --> 00:34:59,430
Hey, Dodgers.

390
00:35:00,890 --> 00:35:01,891
Junsik.

391
00:35:03,059 --> 00:35:04,310
Want me to do that for you?

392
00:35:05,728 --> 00:35:06,729
Yes.

393
00:35:06,813 --> 00:35:09,273
Hey. So...

394
00:35:10,274 --> 00:35:12,235
I can take you out with me right now.

395
00:35:14,862 --> 00:35:16,906
- Really?
- Of course.

396
00:35:17,532 --> 00:35:18,616
Look.

397
00:35:19,617 --> 00:35:23,412
I'm not interested
in fucking small fries like you.

398
00:35:23,871 --> 00:35:24,914
You know what I mean?

399
00:35:28,042 --> 00:35:29,544
Let's get the fuck out of here.

400
00:35:31,087 --> 00:35:32,380
- Uncuff you?
- Yes.

401
00:35:32,463 --> 00:35:35,842
I can't fucking uncuff you, dumbass.
You've got to ask the guard.

402
00:35:35,925 --> 00:35:36,926
Follow me.

403
00:35:40,096 --> 00:35:41,347
Fuck, my cigarettes.

404
00:35:43,141 --> 00:35:44,142
Follow me.

405
00:36:00,575 --> 00:36:01,617
Boss.

406
00:36:03,077 --> 00:36:04,078
How did it go?

407
00:36:05,413 --> 00:36:06,706
Drive him to the hotel.

408
00:36:11,377 --> 00:36:12,420
(GROANS)

409
00:36:12,670 --> 00:36:13,713
Strike.

410
00:36:15,923 --> 00:36:17,383
- Detective Ko.
- Yes, sir?

411
00:36:17,466 --> 00:36:19,969
- When's the game with Gangdong again?
- Next week.

412
00:36:20,052 --> 00:36:24,098
I can't seem to control my pitches.

413
00:36:26,142 --> 00:36:28,477
I'm really sorry, Mingoo.

414
00:36:28,561 --> 00:36:30,897
Why would you do things
you'd be sorry about?

415
00:36:30,980 --> 00:36:32,523
I'm really sorry.

416
00:36:32,607 --> 00:36:35,902
Why did you do it in the first place,
you motherfucker?

417
00:36:39,322 --> 00:36:40,781
- Strike!
- Strike.

418
00:36:44,410 --> 00:36:46,829
I didn't ask you a difficult question.

419
00:36:46,913 --> 00:36:50,249
Just tell me where your boss Yankees is.

420
00:36:50,333 --> 00:36:52,126
Then, I'll set you free.

421
00:36:52,210 --> 00:36:55,129
Why don't you fucking get it,

422
00:36:55,213 --> 00:36:56,881
you damn motherfucker?

423
00:37:00,009 --> 00:37:04,263
Yankees and I don't work together.

424
00:37:04,847 --> 00:37:06,724
GANGNAM

425
00:37:06,807 --> 00:37:07,934
Okay.

426
00:37:08,976 --> 00:37:10,311
Let's do some batting practice.

427
00:37:10,394 --> 00:37:11,520
- Okay.
- Give it to me.

428
00:37:12,521 --> 00:37:13,814
Hitting is my thing.

429
00:37:15,107 --> 00:37:16,692
Wait, Mingoo!

430
00:37:16,776 --> 00:37:18,194
I mean, Detective.

431
00:37:18,277 --> 00:37:20,988
I don't know anything about Yankees.

432
00:37:21,072 --> 00:37:22,198
I really don't!

433
00:37:22,281 --> 00:37:25,451
That asshole Yankees needed money
because he knocked up his girl.

434
00:37:25,534 --> 00:37:27,954
He increased his stock a ton

435
00:37:28,037 --> 00:37:31,624
and then stole all our clients,
so I haven't talked to him since.

436
00:37:32,166 --> 00:37:34,335
What are you talking about?

437
00:37:35,002 --> 00:37:37,004
He got a girl pregnant?

438
00:37:37,713 --> 00:37:40,800
Yes, that girl's a junkie too.

439
00:37:40,883 --> 00:37:42,468
She's a real crazy bitch.

440
00:37:45,096 --> 00:37:47,181
I guess junkies
are attracted to other junkies.

441
00:37:48,266 --> 00:37:49,267
- Am I right?
- Yes.

442
00:37:50,935 --> 00:37:51,936
Yes.

443
00:37:52,353 --> 00:37:54,397
But you don't even know where she is.

444
00:37:54,480 --> 00:37:55,648
I do.

445
00:37:56,774 --> 00:37:58,192
I know where she is.

446
00:37:58,276 --> 00:37:59,527
Are you sure?

447
00:37:59,610 --> 00:38:00,611
I swear to God.

448
00:38:03,364 --> 00:38:05,116
What's the girl's name again?

449
00:38:05,199 --> 00:38:07,827
- Wendy.
- Keep quiet, you bastard.

450
00:38:08,661 --> 00:38:09,787
- Wendy?
- Yes.

451
00:38:09,954 --> 00:38:12,081
Walk quietly. Don't let them hear us.

452
00:38:12,540 --> 00:38:13,582
Where is it?

453
00:38:14,458 --> 00:38:15,459
Where?

454
00:38:15,543 --> 00:38:16,877
I think this is the place.

455
00:38:16,961 --> 00:38:17,962
Yes, this is it.

456
00:38:19,588 --> 00:38:20,881
Are you sure?

457
00:38:20,965 --> 00:38:22,091
- Are you?
- Yes, I am.

458
00:38:22,174 --> 00:38:23,551
- Yankees' girl?
- Yes.

459
00:38:23,634 --> 00:38:24,635
Step aside.

460
00:38:25,136 --> 00:38:26,178
Move.

461
00:38:26,262 --> 00:38:28,014
You fucker!

462
00:38:28,889 --> 00:38:29,890
It's open.

463
00:38:34,603 --> 00:38:35,896
Fuck, did she run away?

464
00:38:38,190 --> 00:38:39,191
She did run away.

465
00:38:39,275 --> 00:38:40,526
She ran away, you fuck!

466
00:38:40,609 --> 00:38:42,069
- Mingoo!
- You son of a bitch.

467
00:38:42,153 --> 00:38:44,864
I said no funny business, you fuck.
Where is she?

468
00:38:44,947 --> 00:38:48,200
- I didn't know she ran away!
- Where the fuck is she?

469
00:38:52,204 --> 00:38:53,284
(IN JAPANESE) Shame on you.

470
00:38:54,040 --> 00:38:56,292
Did you have to make me come
all the way here?

471
00:38:59,962 --> 00:39:02,048
He wants me to come up here personally?

472
00:39:06,635 --> 00:39:09,221
(IN KOREAN) Shouldn't you have at least
come out to welcome me?

473
00:39:11,182 --> 00:39:12,224
I was a bit busy.

474
00:39:12,808 --> 00:39:15,603
Are you trying to insult me?

475
00:39:16,187 --> 00:39:17,480
Insult?

476
00:39:18,689 --> 00:39:20,775
This is nothing compared
to what I suffered.

477
00:39:22,818 --> 00:39:24,153
You bastard.

478
00:39:25,404 --> 00:39:28,991
I guess orphans are going to be orphans.

479
00:39:34,622 --> 00:39:36,290
Watch your mouth.

480
00:39:39,668 --> 00:39:42,755
(IN JAPANESE) Hey,
guess what he just said.

481
00:39:43,714 --> 00:39:45,841
He says I should watch my mouth.

482
00:39:46,717 --> 00:39:48,177
You bastard!

483
00:39:48,260 --> 00:39:50,054
How dare you talk to him like that?

484
00:39:50,179 --> 00:39:51,806
(IN KOREAN) What the fuck is he saying?

485
00:39:51,889 --> 00:39:52,890
Calm down.

486
00:39:52,973 --> 00:39:53,974
(IN JAPANESE) Hey!

487
00:39:55,768 --> 00:39:56,894
Stop.

488
00:40:01,857 --> 00:40:03,567
(IN KOREAN) Put the knife away, Chief Seo.

489
00:40:07,321 --> 00:40:09,657
I'll be generous for one last time.

490
00:40:10,282 --> 00:40:13,661
Double the imports at the same price.

491
00:40:14,328 --> 00:40:17,331
We'll talk about that
after a proper apology.

492
00:40:35,266 --> 00:40:36,809
You son of a bitch.

493
00:40:37,726 --> 00:40:41,188
You'll pay for wasting my time.

494
00:40:47,695 --> 00:40:49,321
(DOOR OPENS, CLOSES)

495
00:40:49,405 --> 00:40:51,657
Damn, I was scared as hell.

496
00:40:53,742 --> 00:40:55,536
Why did you push so hard like that?

497
00:40:55,619 --> 00:40:57,746
How can we sell off the stuff
without them?

498
00:41:00,374 --> 00:41:01,417
Wait, Gicheul.

499
00:41:09,425 --> 00:41:11,135
INCREASE PRICE 30%, 13 MILLION YEN PER KG

500
00:41:12,428 --> 00:41:13,971
Fuck.

501
00:41:26,567 --> 00:41:27,568
(IN JAPANESE) You fool.

502
00:41:56,597 --> 00:41:58,077
(IN KOREAN) Have you seen this movie?

503
00:41:58,557 --> 00:41:59,600
Want to join me?

504
00:41:59,683 --> 00:42:00,935
Haeryun.

505
00:42:03,521 --> 00:42:04,980
I need your help.

506
00:42:09,735 --> 00:42:12,363
I heard Kanemoto called my father.

507
00:42:18,786 --> 00:42:22,248
He suggested we cut out
the Koreans and trade directly.

508
00:42:23,707 --> 00:42:25,960
He said he's sick of laying low.

509
00:42:33,759 --> 00:42:34,760
Haeryun.

510
00:42:37,429 --> 00:42:41,767
Rather than relying on
Mr. Jung or your father,

511
00:42:44,228 --> 00:42:46,564
how about we take the initiative?

512
00:42:48,983 --> 00:42:50,150
Just the two of us.

513
00:43:32,234 --> 00:43:36,488
OYAMA: (IN JAPANESE)
Boss, I'm here to keep my word.

514
00:43:43,996 --> 00:43:47,249
(IN KOREAN)
Is this how they treat their guests?

515
00:43:54,715 --> 00:43:57,343
What? Another pat-down?

516
00:44:03,974 --> 00:44:06,185
My boss has made a disrespectful mistake.

517
00:44:06,685 --> 00:44:08,604
And I'm here today to make up for it.

518
00:44:08,937 --> 00:44:10,314
(IN JAPANESE) Who is this guy?

519
00:44:11,148 --> 00:44:12,566
He's a smart kid.

520
00:44:13,108 --> 00:44:14,777
Please hear him out, sir.

521
00:44:16,487 --> 00:44:20,949
(IN KOREAN) Boss, if you can't stand
seeing someone in business,

522
00:44:21,825 --> 00:44:24,495
you don't have to see him.

523
00:44:27,081 --> 00:44:30,668
First off, let's forget
about the price increase.

524
00:44:31,585 --> 00:44:34,254
I'll take the responsibility
of sending you the product.

525
00:44:35,506 --> 00:44:37,091
And what's Miss Lee doing here?

526
00:44:38,133 --> 00:44:40,594
To talk business as well.

527
00:44:41,720 --> 00:44:44,264
I already talked about business
with your father.

528
00:44:46,809 --> 00:44:48,227
But you haven't with me.

529
00:44:49,895 --> 00:44:53,649
For us to send the product to Japan,
we have to go through Korea.

530
00:44:55,275 --> 00:44:58,320
As you just said, without the middleman,

531
00:44:58,404 --> 00:45:00,447
how in the world
can we deliver the product

532
00:45:01,365 --> 00:45:03,158
all the way from China to Japan?

533
00:45:05,911 --> 00:45:08,330
Unless you have a creative way...

534
00:45:11,417 --> 00:45:14,420
you can't just push through
and hope things will work out.

535
00:45:19,174 --> 00:45:21,009
My father produces the product,

536
00:45:21,719 --> 00:45:23,095
but I make the delivery.

537
00:45:23,804 --> 00:45:24,888
Do you understand?

538
00:45:27,725 --> 00:45:29,226
There will be no direct trade.

539
00:45:41,280 --> 00:45:43,866
So you want to be my son?

540
00:45:45,367 --> 00:45:46,368
(IN JAPANESE) Hey.

541
00:45:46,827 --> 00:45:50,205
We haven't done

(IN KOREAN) What is this?

543
00:46:08,307 --> 00:46:11,518
Becoming father and son
isn't an easy thing.

544
00:46:12,853 --> 00:46:14,688
To have a yakuza father,

545
00:46:15,773 --> 00:46:17,775
you have to do things the yakuza way.

546
00:46:24,031 --> 00:46:26,617
No determination, no trade.

547
00:46:52,851 --> 00:46:55,771
Is this really necessary?

on his own. Help him.

00:48:01,962 --> 00:48:05,340
I've thought of you as my brother.

552
00:48:06,884 --> 00:48:08,844
Why don't you stake your future

553
00:48:11,054 --> 00:48:12,055
on someone

554
00:48:13,849 --> 00:48:15,225
who sees what you're worth?

555
00:48:16,602 --> 00:48:17,686
Are you saying...

556
00:48:18,186 --> 00:48:21,773
It's time for a changing of the guard.

557
00:48:38,373 --> 00:48:40,792
Doesn't this seem familiar?

558
00:48:40,876 --> 00:48:42,628
It's too dangerous.

559
00:48:43,337 --> 00:48:44,504
Shoot him.

560
00:48:44,588 --> 00:48:49,593
When you got old,
you should've quietly quit.

(IN KOREAN) Fucking old geezer.

Now, you can do the trade with me.

What's going on here?

565
00:49:17,829 --> 00:49:21,166
I've talked it over with Mr. Jung.

566
00:49:27,673 --> 00:49:28,966
JUNMO: Wait.

567
00:49:30,467 --> 00:49:33,720
My boss knows about this?

568
00:49:34,805 --> 00:49:38,934
I'll be your new friend, Mr. Jung.

569
00:49:40,519 --> 00:49:41,979
What do you say?

570
00:49:42,062 --> 00:49:43,146
How can I trust you?

571
00:49:46,775 --> 00:49:48,276
You have to.

572
00:49:50,487 --> 00:49:51,697
There's no other option.

573
00:50:27,941 --> 00:50:29,401
That was neatly done.

574
00:50:29,484 --> 00:50:30,819
Now, can you trust me?

575
00:50:33,447 --> 00:50:34,573
Thank you.

00:50:37,200 --> 00:50:39,453
