00:14:23,904 --> 00:14:25,114
How's Dohyung?

CHANGSIK: He's recovering,
so don't worry too much.

186

How's Jung Gicheul?

187
00:14:33,706 --> 00:14:35,165
I managed to extract him all right.

188
00:14:36,250 --> 00:14:37,459
I think he's okay.

189
00:14:37,543 --> 00:14:40,296
We found traces of meth
in Hwang Mingoo's car.

190
00:14:41,255 --> 00:14:44,592
It seems Choi Jungbae
and Hwang Mingoo made a deal.

193
00:14:51,473 --> 00:14:52,474
What happened?

194
00:14:57,187 --> 00:15:01,066
Choi Jungbae and Hwang Mingoo.
Those bastards joined forces.

195
00:15:02,151 --> 00:15:03,152
And all the boys

196
00:15:03,944 --> 00:15:04,945
turned against me.

197
00:15:07,990 --> 00:15:11,327
But does Choi Jungbae know

198
00:15:12,620 --> 00:15:15,122
who our business partner in Japan is?

199
00:15:16,248 --> 00:15:17,249
Only I know that.

00:15:18,959 --> 00:15:21,086
We have to get our stuff back first.

How can we? He's with the cops now.

202
00:15:23,923 --> 00:15:24,924
You have ideas?

203
00:15:27,176 --> 00:15:28,552
From now on, our main focus is

204
00:15:29,094 --> 00:15:31,555
to pressure Gangnam Union
as much as we can.

205
00:15:32,348 --> 00:15:36,936
Let's make sure
Captain Seok's death wasn't in vain.

206
00:15:38,354 --> 00:15:39,939
Do you think catching those guys

207
00:15:40,022 --> 00:15:42,107
will pressure Gangnam Union though?

208
00:15:42,191 --> 00:15:44,902
We're not trying to kill Gangnam Union.

209
00:15:45,778 --> 00:15:49,657
We want to narrow down
their potential partners to just one.

00:16:42,167 --> 00:16:44,378
we just need them
to successfully close the deal.

that I should stop if things get too hard?

I told you to put an APB on all three
of them, including the blind man.

I did look into it,

263
00:19:58,238 --> 00:19:59,865

00:19:59,948 --> 00:20:02,993
is under custodial interrogation
at SMPA as a murder suspect.

can't get arrested right now.

What about the other lackey, Kwon Seungho?

00:20:11,210 --> 00:20:15,130
I tried to put that bastard
on the wanted list,

269
00:20:15,214 --> 00:20:16,256
but it didn't work.

God damn it. What didn't work?

271
00:20:18,592 --> 00:20:22,095
In the police intranet, I entered
Kwon Seungho's name, but it didn't work.

272
00:20:22,179 --> 00:20:23,513
Maybe it was deleted.

in the market benefits you too, right?

You seem pretty suspicious.

363
00:26:44,436 --> 00:26:47,689
I don't think someone who betrayed
his own boss has a right to say that.

364
00:26:48,773 --> 00:26:50,900
Betrayed? (LAUGHS)

365
00:26:50,984 --> 00:26:52,485
What do you mean "betrayed"?

366
00:26:53,403 --> 00:26:56,031
Those who are weak
are supposed to fall off.

367
00:26:56,114 --> 00:26:57,782
That's the way it is in our business.

368
00:26:57,866 --> 00:27:00,535
Let's have those
who are strong like us join forces.

369
00:27:00,869 --> 00:27:02,829
(CHUCKLES) You're pretty bold.

370
00:27:03,622 --> 00:27:06,750
We are bold indeed.

371
00:27:07,250 --> 00:27:11,379
It was actually my suggestion
that we receive 30kg too.

372
00:27:14,132 --> 00:27:16,968
We'll have to act swiftly
to make amends with the Japanese.

373
00:27:17,052 --> 00:27:18,136
And the location.

374
00:27:19,179 --> 00:27:20,472
You know where, right?

375
00:27:20,555 --> 00:27:21,556
Yes.

376
00:27:22,474 --> 00:27:23,767
I know the general area.

377
00:27:23,850 --> 00:27:27,145
But I drank a lot yesterday,
so not the exact location.

378
00:27:27,228 --> 00:27:28,229
Where was it?

379
00:27:29,230 --> 00:27:30,398
(CLEARS THROAT)

380
00:27:44,829 --> 00:27:45,830
Oh.

381
00:27:57,133 --> 00:27:58,301
Go to this place

382
00:27:59,386 --> 00:28:01,596
and deliver the stuff on time.

383
00:28:03,932 --> 00:28:07,477
Don't fool around, and send us the money
as soon as you get it from Japan.

384
00:28:14,651 --> 00:28:15,819
Oh, here.

385
00:28:16,611 --> 00:28:17,612
Okay.

386
00:28:17,696 --> 00:28:19,280
There won't be any setbacks

387
00:28:20,323 --> 00:28:22,033
like there were with Mr. Jung, right?

388
00:28:22,951 --> 00:28:26,246
That guy caused so many problems
when he was around, right?

389
00:28:26,329 --> 00:28:28,790
I was the one
who always cleaned up his messes.

390
00:28:32,168 --> 00:28:33,169
Let's get this done.

391
00:28:34,921 --> 00:28:36,047
Let's do that.

392
00:28:38,550 --> 00:28:39,551
(IN MANDARIN) Miss.

393
00:28:39,634 --> 00:28:41,344
You don't know them very well.

394
00:28:41,845 --> 00:28:42,846
So why were you

395
00:28:43,638 --> 00:28:45,014
so agreeable to them?

00:28:57,152 --> 00:28:58,153
(IN KOREAN) Hello?

399
00:29:00,488 --> 00:29:02,073
Seungho, I did as you said.

400
00:29:04,617 --> 00:29:06,244
The deal is tomorrow in Pohang.

401
00:29:06,911 --> 00:29:08,288
Thank you so much, Haeryun.

402
00:29:09,330 --> 00:29:11,875
But we don't know what scheme
Choi Jungbae might have,

403
00:29:12,876 --> 00:29:13,877
so be careful.

404
00:29:14,711 --> 00:29:15,712
Okay.

405
00:29:23,511 --> 00:29:25,221
They know you're close with her.

406
00:29:25,889 --> 00:29:27,348
Do you think they'll trust her?

407
00:29:27,432 --> 00:29:29,809
With a huge fortune
waiting right in front of them,

408
00:29:29,893 --> 00:29:32,312
those fools can't think clearly
to figure it out.

409
00:29:43,448 --> 00:29:46,534
Choi Jungbae will send the stuff
to the Japanese in Pohang tomorrow.

410
00:29:46,618 --> 00:29:47,786
And Jung Gicheul

411

Choi Jungbae receives.

412
00:29:51,748 --> 00:29:53,666
If the boat departs tomorrow,

413
00:29:54,250 --> 00:29:56,544
Oyama will receive it in two days.

414
00:29:56,628 --> 00:29:57,754
I guess so.

415
00:29:57,837 --> 00:30:01,090
I'll put China and Japan on standby.

416
00:30:01,841 --> 00:30:03,760
Let's make this happen this time.

417
00:30:04,511 --> 00:30:05,553
By the way,

418
00:30:08,223 --> 00:30:10,934
why can't I reach Dohyung?

419
00:30:11,768 --> 00:30:13,269
Are you sure he's all right?

420
00:30:13,853 --> 00:30:15,063
Don't worry.

421
00:30:15,146 --> 00:30:17,232
Since he's injured, I told him to rest up.

422
00:30:18,817 --> 00:30:19,984
We're almost there now.

423

Yes.

What's the name of the departed?

432
00:31:00,650 --> 00:31:01,860
Seok Dohyung.

433
00:31:01,943 --> 00:31:04,737
What is this about?

434
00:31:08,533 --> 00:31:10,451

She's actually married though.
