THE CHARACTERS, PLACES, ORGANIZATIONS AND
EVENTS IN THIS DRAMA ARE WORKS OF FICTION

2
00:02:09,504 --> 00:02:16,427
THE WORST OF EVIL

3
00:02:20,473 --> 00:02:23,518
2 YEARS AGO, 1994
SEOUL, SOUTH KOREA

4
00:02:30,817 --> 00:02:32,193
-Hey.
-Hi.

5
00:02:33,903 --> 00:02:35,029
Gosh.

6
00:02:35,697 --> 00:02:37,657
Did you feel bad
for the street vendor again?

7
00:02:38,199 --> 00:02:40,618
It's not that.
I bought it because it's tasty.

8
00:02:40,702 --> 00:02:41,870
-It is tasty.
-Yeah.

9
00:02:43,246 --> 00:02:44,497
What's with the uniform?

10
00:02:44,581 --> 00:02:47,000
I told you I'm transferring
to the security division.

11
00:02:47,834 --> 00:02:49,002
That was today?

12
00:02:53,923 --> 00:02:55,175
Let's eat.

13
00:02:57,260 --> 00:02:59,095
She's transferring
to the security division,

14
00:02:59,179 --> 00:03:02,932
marking the official beginning
of her elite career path.

15
00:03:03,808 --> 00:03:05,018
You know that, right?

16
00:03:05,101 --> 00:03:06,477
Yes, of course.

17
00:03:07,687 --> 00:03:09,397
It's something worth celebrating

18
00:03:09,480 --> 00:03:10,607
with the whole family.

19
00:03:11,649 --> 00:03:13,651
I mean, your wife was appointed to Seoul

20
00:03:13,735 --> 00:03:15,862
upon her promotion as assistant inspector.

21
00:03:17,197 --> 00:03:20,116
Have you been in touch
with your father lately?

22
00:03:20,950 --> 00:03:22,869
No, I'm not.

23
00:03:23,369 --> 00:03:25,747
Well, he's getting old,

24
00:03:25,830 --> 00:03:27,540
so he should pull himself together

25
00:03:27,624 --> 00:03:29,250
and try to stay healthy.

26
00:03:30,251 --> 00:03:31,294
Yes.

27
00:03:32,128 --> 00:03:33,296
All right.

28
00:03:33,880 --> 00:03:36,674
How's the prep
for the promotion exam going?

29
00:03:36,758 --> 00:03:39,886
I should be preparing,
but I can't seem to find time for it.

30
00:03:39,969 --> 00:03:42,764
Then make time for it, man.

31
00:03:42,847 --> 00:03:45,183
Your wife's an elite officer.

32
00:03:45,266 --> 00:03:47,185
And you're a mere low-ranking detective

33
00:03:47,268 --> 00:03:48,686
in the boondocks.

34
00:03:48,770 --> 00:03:51,064
-What?
-Could you stop saying nonsense?

35
00:03:51,147 --> 00:03:52,148
Nonsense?

36
00:03:52,232 --> 00:03:55,026
Stop being so condescending
as if you're much older.

37
00:03:55,109 --> 00:03:57,737
Your new executive title
doesn't mean you're mature.

38
00:03:57,820 --> 00:03:58,821
As I always say,

39
00:03:58,905 --> 00:04:01,950
if KNPU accepted women
when I was applying for university,

40
00:04:02,033 --> 00:04:03,368
I'd be an executive too by now.

41
00:04:03,451 --> 00:04:04,452
Enough.

42
00:04:05,078 --> 00:04:07,080
Enjoy your drink

43
00:04:08,039 --> 00:04:10,083
and stay as long as you want.

44
00:04:10,166 --> 00:04:11,960
I'm going to the hospital
to visit your mom.

45
00:04:12,043 --> 00:04:14,212
- I'll drive you.
- It's fine.

46
00:04:14,295 --> 00:04:16,839
Closing the case
didn't gain you anything.

47
00:04:16,923 --> 00:04:19,384
If you wanted to move to Seoul,
you should've come to

48
00:04:19,467 --> 00:04:20,843
the retirement ceremony,

49
00:04:20,927 --> 00:04:22,136
socialize with others...

50
00:04:48,204 --> 00:04:49,914
My brothers are such jerks, right?

51
00:04:50,581 --> 00:04:52,000
We don't have to come again.

52
00:04:52,875 --> 00:04:54,836
I'd rather visit my mom than come here.

53
00:04:58,548 --> 00:05:00,508
How's your mother? Is she all right?

54
00:05:01,801 --> 00:05:03,636
Yes, she's all right.

55
00:05:08,850 --> 00:05:12,228
Just forget
what my dad said about your father.

56
00:05:12,812 --> 00:05:14,314
I've forgotten about it too.

57
00:05:24,407 --> 00:05:26,492
It's from my church back in high school.

58
00:05:27,160 --> 00:05:28,703
I should take that home.

59
00:05:40,131 --> 00:05:41,132
GANGNAM, SOUTH KOREA

60
00:05:41,215 --> 00:05:42,592
Come to our club!

61
00:05:43,092 --> 00:05:46,179
Come to All Night Club!
Free beer for the ladies.

62
00:05:46,763 --> 00:05:48,056
Stop. Damn it.

63
00:05:48,139 --> 00:05:49,640
You bitch!

64
00:05:49,724 --> 00:05:51,976
Why are you guys not working?
Come here.

65
00:05:52,268 --> 00:05:53,603
-Hello.
-This is so annoying.

66
00:05:53,978 --> 00:05:57,231
Guys, it's "Please come
to All Night Club."

67
00:05:57,315 --> 00:05:58,941
Got it?

68
00:05:59,025 --> 00:06:00,526
Seriously, what are you doing?

69
00:06:00,985 --> 00:06:02,653
Do you wanna make Gicheul go nuts?

70
00:06:02,737 --> 00:06:03,738
DJ CHEOLI

71
00:06:27,845 --> 00:06:29,097
Hey, Superstar Lee!

72
00:06:29,180 --> 00:06:30,181
Hey, what's up?

73
00:06:30,515 --> 00:06:31,808
How's it going?

74
00:06:31,891 --> 00:06:33,559
-Good?
-Girls are super hot today.

75
00:06:33,976 --> 00:06:35,478
I mean, look.

76
00:06:38,106 --> 00:06:39,524
- Hey!
- He's so cute!

77
00:06:44,529 --> 00:06:47,448
-She was right under our noses!
-Whoo!

78
00:07:10,596 --> 00:07:13,057
He stepped on me first!

79
00:07:13,141 --> 00:07:14,392
Hey.

80
00:07:15,101 --> 00:07:17,937
If you want to flaunt your strength,
do it at your hometown.

81
00:07:18,020 --> 00:07:20,356
In Gangnam, just shut it and drink.

82
00:07:22,400 --> 00:07:23,734
If you don't want to die.

83
00:07:25,486 --> 00:07:28,448
Let's change the vibe
with something mellow.

84
00:07:29,282 --> 00:07:32,452
Okay.
Let's take these gentlemen outside.

85
00:07:34,036 --> 00:07:38,291
Next round.

86
00:07:39,292 --> 00:07:41,461
Rumor has it that

87
00:07:41,544 --> 00:07:43,296
you were born and raised here,

88
00:07:43,379 --> 00:07:46,424
have lots of connections, and can fight.

89
00:07:46,507 --> 00:07:50,261
So why are you working as a DJ?

90
00:07:51,929 --> 00:07:53,514
Let's work together.

91
00:07:54,891 --> 00:07:58,519
I want to work with legit Gangnam natives.

92
00:07:59,437 --> 00:08:01,856
Why be a night club DJ

93
00:08:01,939 --> 00:08:04,025
when you can own one?

94
00:08:05,443 --> 00:08:06,819
And I can make that happen.

95
00:08:09,739 --> 00:08:10,740
Is it for real?

96
00:08:12,408 --> 00:08:14,535
When will you make me an owner?

97
00:08:15,620 --> 00:08:18,789
-What? Are you in a rush?
-I want to make money quickly.

98
00:08:19,749 --> 00:08:21,375
Are you poor?

99
00:08:21,501 --> 00:08:24,045
You think
everyone in Gangnam is rich?

100
00:08:24,128 --> 00:08:25,963
You son of a bitch.

101
00:08:26,047 --> 00:08:27,465
Watch your language.

102
00:08:33,012 --> 00:08:34,430
Jung Gicheul.

103
00:08:34,514 --> 00:08:39,060
If you bring
all your friends to work here,

104
00:08:40,978 --> 00:08:42,438
I'll make you an owner.

105
00:08:43,439 --> 00:08:44,524
Does that sound good?

106
00:08:49,153 --> 00:08:50,488
Do I have your word?

107
00:08:51,906 --> 00:08:53,032
My word?

108
00:08:54,867 --> 00:08:56,077
Is this what you want?

109
00:08:56,410 --> 00:08:57,537
Is it?

110
00:09:11,926 --> 00:09:13,177
1 YEAR LATER, 1995
GANGNAM, SOUTH KOREA

111
00:09:15,263 --> 00:09:16,722
-Hello, sir.
-Hello.

112
00:09:16,806 --> 00:09:18,099
-Enjoy that.
-Yes, sir.

113
00:09:34,865 --> 00:09:37,952
Hello, Boss.

114
00:09:38,035 --> 00:09:39,036
Did you find her?

115
00:09:39,161 --> 00:09:41,205
It's Professor Yoon.

116
00:09:41,289 --> 00:09:43,457
I hear she's the best.

117
00:09:44,458 --> 00:09:45,501
Did you meet her?

118
00:09:46,294 --> 00:09:49,672
Yes, but I was told she's retired.

119
00:09:51,173 --> 00:09:53,175
Hey, money can solve anything.

120
00:09:54,302 --> 00:09:56,304
Stay in touch with her.

121
00:09:56,387 --> 00:09:57,888
Yes, Boss.

122
00:10:07,481 --> 00:10:09,150
Gicheul!

123
00:10:10,359 --> 00:10:12,528
We need you downstairs.

124
00:10:12,612 --> 00:10:13,654
What's up?

125
00:10:13,738 --> 00:10:15,656
I'm sorry. Please come downstairs.

126
00:10:24,415 --> 00:10:26,834
Stand up, you damn bitch.

127
00:10:27,418 --> 00:10:29,503
-Hey.
-Seriously, stop!

128
00:10:37,595 --> 00:10:38,721
Wait...

129
00:10:38,804 --> 00:10:40,306
You little...

130
00:10:40,514 --> 00:10:41,682
Let go of me!

131
00:10:41,766 --> 00:10:43,142
You annoying bitch.

132
00:10:43,225 --> 00:10:45,061
I said pour the drink!

133
00:10:45,144 --> 00:10:46,437
No, don't.

134
00:10:47,355 --> 00:10:48,773
He's from a rich family.

135
00:10:49,774 --> 00:10:51,067
Hit me.

136
00:10:51,150 --> 00:10:53,194
Go on and hit me, you bastard.

137
00:10:53,277 --> 00:10:56,864
This fucking moron can't even hit me.

138
00:10:57,698 --> 00:10:59,241
Who are these losers?

139
00:11:01,243 --> 00:11:03,287
How fucking dare you?

140
00:11:05,331 --> 00:11:06,415
Hey.

141
00:11:08,209 --> 00:11:09,627
Do you know who I am?

142
00:11:10,961 --> 00:11:13,547
Just take this and get lost.

143
00:11:16,926 --> 00:11:17,968
Get lost.

144
00:11:18,302 --> 00:11:20,638
Bullshit, fucking moron.

145
00:11:27,144 --> 00:11:30,147
Do you think our boss took you in
so you could do this?

146
00:11:30,481 --> 00:11:32,316
You good-for-nothing DJ.

147
00:11:37,571 --> 00:11:38,698
Light my cigarette.

148
00:11:52,294 --> 00:11:54,922
And what's with you?

149
00:11:55,005 --> 00:11:56,132
Are you Gen X or what?

150
00:11:56,632 --> 00:11:59,218
Huh? You and your stupid style.

151
00:12:00,219 --> 00:12:03,472
Nobody here will take you seriously
if you dress like that.

152
00:12:04,140 --> 00:12:05,141
Gicheul.

153
00:12:06,934 --> 00:12:09,937
You've got to do better, okay?

154
00:12:10,020 --> 00:12:11,021
You see...

155
00:12:11,605 --> 00:12:13,399
You motherfucker...

156
00:12:15,067 --> 00:12:18,070
Looks like losers got tempers too.

157
00:12:21,198 --> 00:12:24,493
It's been a year.
Can you keep your promise now?

158
00:12:30,875 --> 00:12:32,626
God damn it.

159
00:12:32,710 --> 00:12:36,130
Have some patience, you broke-ass bitch.

160
00:12:36,714 --> 00:12:40,926
If it's difficult, at least allow me
to make money in my own way.

161
00:12:41,010 --> 00:12:42,219
I know a way

162
00:12:42,303 --> 00:12:44,597
to make a fortune for all of us.

163
00:12:44,805 --> 00:12:46,265
And what is the way?

164
00:12:49,852 --> 00:12:50,895
Go.

165
00:12:55,816 --> 00:12:59,487
I've been in the nightlife business
for a while, and I know

166
00:12:59,570 --> 00:13:01,822
who distributes marijuana and meth.

167
00:13:02,782 --> 00:13:04,325
If we wipe out the small fries

168
00:13:04,408 --> 00:13:05,993
and take over the distribution,

169
00:13:06,076 --> 00:13:07,495
we'll make good money.

170
00:13:09,288 --> 00:13:10,581
If you fund this plan,

171
00:13:10,664 --> 00:13:12,625
I'll do the groundwork.

172
00:13:12,708 --> 00:13:14,001
Are you telling me

173
00:13:16,170 --> 00:13:18,005
to become a junkie?

174
00:13:18,088 --> 00:13:19,215
We're only selling it.

175
00:13:20,132 --> 00:13:22,968
We just need to keep our boys
from doing drugs.

176
00:13:24,637 --> 00:13:25,930
Right.

177
00:13:26,305 --> 00:13:28,224
I see.

178
00:13:31,644 --> 00:13:33,270
You son of a bitch.

179
00:13:33,896 --> 00:13:37,817
You are out of your mind.

180
00:13:40,152 --> 00:13:42,905
I'm Korea's biggest boss
Song Donghyuk's right-hand man.

181
00:13:42,988 --> 00:13:44,824
And you're telling me to sell drugs?

182
00:13:45,366 --> 00:13:48,619
You think I'm some two-bit thug?

183
00:13:49,328 --> 00:13:51,497
I'm Sergeant Jang,

184
00:13:52,540 --> 00:13:54,583
not a drug dealer.

185
00:13:54,667 --> 00:13:58,087
I'm the president of Gangnam,
Sergeant Jang, you moron.

186
00:13:58,170 --> 00:14:00,798
Do you have a death wish or what?

187
00:14:01,882 --> 00:14:03,300
Hey, you.

188
00:14:03,968 --> 00:14:06,387
Watch that stupid mouth of yours.

189
00:14:09,181 --> 00:14:10,599
I'm warning you.

190
00:14:13,811 --> 00:14:15,229
What an annoying punk.

191
00:14:30,119 --> 00:14:31,161
Jang, that bastard.

192
00:14:31,245 --> 00:14:32,997
He promised us a Mercedes.

193
00:14:34,039 --> 00:14:35,374
God damn it!

194
00:14:36,250 --> 00:14:38,502
We're shitheads,
so he can treat us like shit.

195
00:14:38,752 --> 00:14:40,963
But he can't treat Gicheul like that.

196
00:14:41,547 --> 00:14:43,340
We're all here because of Gicheul.

197
00:14:43,424 --> 00:14:46,135
But those motherfuckers
aren't giving him respect.

198
00:14:47,678 --> 00:14:48,762
Is your face okay?

199
00:14:49,471 --> 00:14:50,514
Are you guys okay?

200
00:14:53,058 --> 00:14:54,393
Living like this, I mean.

201
00:14:54,602 --> 00:14:56,478
We're okay, God damn it.

202
00:14:57,271 --> 00:14:59,732
We would've happily joined you
no matter what.

203
00:14:59,815 --> 00:15:00,858
He's right.

204
00:15:00,941 --> 00:15:04,069
We can even go to hell
if that's where you want to go.

205
00:15:04,737 --> 00:15:07,448
We can even dig out shit
if that's what you want to do.

206
00:15:07,740 --> 00:15:09,533
That's gross, you freak.

207
00:15:16,081 --> 00:15:17,917
Come on and let's do it.

208
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:19,418
Do what?

209
00:15:19,501 --> 00:15:20,961
God damn it!

210
00:15:21,545 --> 00:15:24,173
- Hey.
- I'll get it ready by tomorrow.

211
00:15:24,256 --> 00:15:25,841
Let's do it tomorrow, okay?

212
00:15:25,925 --> 00:15:27,217
Honey.

213
00:15:27,301 --> 00:15:29,011
I'll make you feel good tomorrow.

214
00:15:29,094 --> 00:15:31,347
So just get some rest today, okay?

215
00:15:32,264 --> 00:15:35,517
Tomorrow, you better...

216
00:15:50,532 --> 00:15:51,533
Fucking bitch!

217
00:16:16,809 --> 00:16:17,977
Hey, what's up?

218
00:16:18,060 --> 00:16:20,688
Your go-to hotel
in Jeongseon for holidays.

219
00:16:21,105 --> 00:16:22,272
Is it in the mountains?

220
00:16:22,731 --> 00:16:25,067
Yeah, it's in the middle of a forest.

221
00:16:25,150 --> 00:16:26,610
It has nothing but fresh air.

222
00:16:29,738 --> 00:16:31,240
Hook me up with them.

223
00:16:31,490 --> 00:16:33,158
He killed a man in middle school

224
00:16:33,242 --> 00:16:34,743
and served five years already.

225
00:16:36,036 --> 00:16:37,037
That's him.

226
00:16:44,586 --> 00:16:46,505
I already told him about us,

227
00:16:46,588 --> 00:16:48,424
so I'll leave you two alone to talk.

228
00:16:48,841 --> 00:16:50,676
RECRUIT KNIFE WIELDER

229
00:16:51,468 --> 00:16:52,511
I'm Jung Gicheul.

230
00:17:02,396 --> 00:17:03,814
You've got something inside.

231
00:17:10,487 --> 00:17:11,739
You've got something too.

232
00:17:19,204 --> 00:17:20,622
What can you do for me?

233
00:17:21,874 --> 00:17:23,250
Two clubs in Gangnam.

234
00:17:25,502 --> 00:17:26,503
Deal.

235
00:17:27,546 --> 00:17:30,257
Let's wipe out the those fucking pigs

236
00:17:33,135 --> 00:17:34,803
and take over Gangnam.

237
00:17:40,642 --> 00:17:43,270
NEW JEONGSEON HOTEL

238
00:17:49,526 --> 00:17:50,527
Is this the place?

239
00:18:00,996 --> 00:18:02,915
PRESIDENT JANG'S
MUTUAL AID SOCIETY OUTING

240
00:18:06,085 --> 00:18:08,295
- Eat up, guys.
- Thank you, sir.

241
00:18:10,589 --> 00:18:12,966
Mr. Jung Gicheul.

242
00:18:13,175 --> 00:18:15,135
You suck at soccer!

243
00:18:17,054 --> 00:18:19,473
It's okay. There's always next time.

244
00:18:21,100 --> 00:18:23,352
Man, you really sucked.

245
00:18:23,435 --> 00:18:24,937
Enjoy the food, guys.

246
00:18:29,608 --> 00:18:30,901
Hey, Kwon Taeho.

247
00:18:31,485 --> 00:18:32,569
Yes, sir!

248
00:18:36,031 --> 00:18:37,616
Where is the owner?

249
00:18:37,783 --> 00:18:41,286
He said he didn't want to interrupt
and wanted us to enjoy ourselves.

250
00:18:41,370 --> 00:18:43,539
He'll come tomorrow morning to say hi.

251
00:18:44,748 --> 00:18:45,833
Is that so?

252
00:18:47,417 --> 00:18:48,418
By the way,

253
00:18:49,586 --> 00:18:51,213
why are there no other guests?

254
00:18:52,005 --> 00:18:54,133
He said it's normal during the off-season.

255
00:18:54,716 --> 00:18:58,428
So the owner here was
your baseball team coach in middle school?

256
00:18:58,512 --> 00:19:00,722
Yes, his family is very rich.

257
00:19:00,806 --> 00:19:03,392
He said, if you like it here,

258
00:19:03,475 --> 00:19:05,686
he'd like a little help next year

259
00:19:05,769 --> 00:19:07,938
with the new hotel construction
in Gangnam.

260
00:19:09,064 --> 00:19:11,483
All right.
Tell him I'll keep that in mind.

261
00:19:11,692 --> 00:19:12,734
Yes, sir.

262
00:21:12,771 --> 00:21:13,772
Next.

263
00:21:15,899 --> 00:21:17,025
You punks!

264
00:21:45,053 --> 00:21:46,054
Fucking bastard!

265
00:21:50,767 --> 00:21:51,768
Fuck!

266
00:21:52,769 --> 00:21:56,898
You little rats!
I'm going to kill you all!

267
00:21:57,566 --> 00:21:58,608
Argh!

268
00:22:01,028 --> 00:22:02,029
You fuckers!

269
00:22:05,115 --> 00:22:06,116
Fuck!

270
00:22:09,286 --> 00:22:10,620
Fucking bastards.

271
00:22:16,335 --> 00:22:17,586
You fuckers!

272
00:22:17,669 --> 00:22:18,962
Move, you bastard!

273
00:22:29,264 --> 00:22:31,224
What the hell is all this?

274
00:22:54,664 --> 00:22:58,835
Do folks from Seoul never sleep at night?

275
00:23:01,671 --> 00:23:02,923
Kill them all.

276
00:23:03,632 --> 00:23:04,800
Wipe them out!

277
00:23:06,301 --> 00:23:07,969
Kill them all!

278
00:23:08,053 --> 00:23:09,346
Kill them!

279
00:23:42,712 --> 00:23:44,172
Son of a bitch!

280
00:24:12,367 --> 00:24:14,035
Boss!

281
00:24:16,580 --> 00:24:17,622
Boss!

282
00:24:20,834 --> 00:24:22,002
Boss!

283
00:24:35,557 --> 00:24:36,558
Damn it.

284
00:24:42,481 --> 00:24:44,149
Bastard...

285
00:24:44,774 --> 00:24:45,901
Fuck!

286
00:25:00,248 --> 00:25:01,249
Come on!

287
00:25:36,117 --> 00:25:37,410
Fine.

288
00:25:38,578 --> 00:25:40,205
Fuck.

289
00:25:41,206 --> 00:25:42,499
Enough, all right?

290
00:25:43,375 --> 00:25:44,501
You can have Gangnam.

291
00:25:45,377 --> 00:25:46,628
Take it.

292
00:25:46,920 --> 00:25:48,672
I've taken care of things outside.

293
00:25:48,755 --> 00:25:50,840
Thanks. Now, wrap it up.

294
00:25:50,924 --> 00:25:52,175
Okay.

295
00:26:00,100 --> 00:26:02,435
What now?

296
00:26:02,519 --> 00:26:04,563
Fine. Whatever.

297
00:26:09,693 --> 00:26:10,902
Get your hands off me.

298
00:26:10,986 --> 00:26:12,487
I said, get your hands off me.

299
00:26:13,405 --> 00:26:15,782
Get off me, you bastard!

300
00:26:16,533 --> 00:26:17,534
You little...

301
00:26:20,954 --> 00:26:23,123
Hey, asshole.

302
00:26:23,206 --> 00:26:25,959
Do you have a death wish? Huh?

303
00:26:31,798 --> 00:26:34,175
Can't you see what's going on?

304
00:26:36,636 --> 00:26:38,013
Taeho, no. Don't!

305
00:26:39,764 --> 00:26:40,974
You fucker.

306
00:26:41,057 --> 00:26:42,892
I told you to get your hands off me.

307
00:26:43,602 --> 00:26:45,312
-Taeho!
-You bastard.

308
00:26:46,688 --> 00:26:49,232
Let go, you bastard!

309
00:26:49,316 --> 00:26:51,067
Get off me, you asshole!

310
00:26:51,735 --> 00:26:54,529
I'm going to kill you all.

311
00:26:56,114 --> 00:26:58,408
You're all fucking dead now.

312
00:27:01,828 --> 00:27:04,164
My men from Busan
are going to come for you!

313
00:27:05,165 --> 00:27:06,166
You motherfuckers.

314
00:27:09,919 --> 00:27:11,588
Give me the damn watch

315
00:27:11,671 --> 00:27:14,466
that dead bastard has!

316
00:27:15,050 --> 00:27:16,635
That's my fucking watch, you...

317
00:27:25,185 --> 00:27:26,436
I said...

318
00:27:33,318 --> 00:27:35,403
What the...

319
00:27:35,987 --> 00:27:39,199
You son of a...

320
00:27:45,914 --> 00:27:47,290
You fucking...

321
00:27:47,374 --> 00:27:49,000
You scumbag!

322
00:27:49,084 --> 00:27:51,461
Die, you scumbag!

323
00:28:32,627 --> 00:28:35,797
BUSAN, SOUTH KOREA

324
00:28:39,759 --> 00:28:41,261
Pleased to meet you, sir.

325
00:28:41,344 --> 00:28:42,804
My name is Jung Gicheul.

326
00:28:43,930 --> 00:28:47,934
Sergeant Jang became blood brothers with
Jaegeon Group's Sung Kisoo a month ago.

327
00:28:48,226 --> 00:28:51,020
I overheard their conversation
while drinking.

328
00:28:51,563 --> 00:28:53,314
He's cutting ties with Busan

329
00:28:53,398 --> 00:28:56,025
and now wants to start anew
under Sung Kisoo in Seoul.

330
00:28:57,485 --> 00:28:59,112
In case you wouldn't believe me,

331
00:28:59,195 --> 00:29:00,447
I took a photo.

332
00:29:03,450 --> 00:29:06,411
It wouldn't be so complicated
if he were here.

333
00:29:07,579 --> 00:29:09,080
But I can't seem to reach him.

334
00:29:14,919 --> 00:29:17,714
What did you do to him?

335
00:29:19,799 --> 00:29:22,677
Did you bury him on a mountain

336
00:29:22,802 --> 00:29:23,928
or...

337
00:29:26,389 --> 00:29:27,807
throw him into the sea?

338
00:29:27,891 --> 00:29:30,435
While we were bringing him to Seoul,

339
00:29:30,518 --> 00:29:31,770
he suddenly ran away.

340
00:29:32,437 --> 00:29:34,731
We don't know where he is either.

341
00:29:34,814 --> 00:29:36,775
He killed his own family.

342
00:29:37,692 --> 00:29:40,236
And I just came from the funeral.

343
00:29:41,279 --> 00:29:43,490
Whether he betrayed or killed someone,

344
00:29:43,573 --> 00:29:45,325
he's still my guy.

345
00:29:45,575 --> 00:29:48,953
If you wanted to get rid of him,
you should've asked for permission.

346
00:29:49,746 --> 00:29:52,999
You can't do it the other way around.
That is just wrong.

347
00:30:01,674 --> 00:30:02,842
And yet,

348
00:30:03,843 --> 00:30:05,678
you came here of your own free will.

349
00:30:11,976 --> 00:30:13,311
What was your name again?

350
00:30:13,394 --> 00:30:14,771
It's Jung Gicheul.

351
00:30:15,897 --> 00:30:16,898
Jung Gicheul.

352
00:30:19,609 --> 00:30:23,446
Jung Gicheul is A, an idiot

353
00:30:23,530 --> 00:30:26,199
or B, a nutjob.

354
00:30:29,244 --> 00:30:32,372
What if there's a C?

355
00:30:34,707 --> 00:30:36,501
If you take me in,

356
00:30:37,460 --> 00:30:38,545
I promise

357
00:30:38,628 --> 00:30:41,631
to take only Nonhyeon-dong
and Yeoksam-dong.

358
00:30:41,714 --> 00:30:43,091
And...

359
00:30:43,174 --> 00:30:46,010
I'll send you 50 million won every month.

360
00:30:46,094 --> 00:30:47,262
You have my word.

361
00:31:01,818 --> 00:31:04,612
Do you even know
what you're talking about?

362
00:31:04,696 --> 00:31:06,865
If you send me 50 million every month,

363
00:31:07,949 --> 00:31:10,451
how will you pay your guys?

364
00:31:41,733 --> 00:31:43,109
You must be Professor Yoon.

365
00:31:43,192 --> 00:31:45,528
Are you from
the prosecution or the police?

366
00:31:48,197 --> 00:31:50,575
I'm the one who sent you
the China travel guide.

367
00:32:06,466 --> 00:32:07,800
It came with some gold.

368
00:32:09,093 --> 00:32:10,803
My name is Jung Gicheul.

369
00:33:24,627 --> 00:33:26,212
SEOUL CENTRAL DISTRICT
PROSECUTORS' OFFICE

370
00:33:30,216 --> 00:33:31,217
Hey.

371
00:33:34,721 --> 00:33:37,223
I'm Murayama Hideaki.
Tokyo Metropolitan Police,

372
00:33:37,306 --> 00:33:38,933
Narcotics Control Department.

373
00:33:41,269 --> 00:33:44,355
Cho Changsik, Chief Prosecutor
of Serious Crime Division.

374
00:33:48,234 --> 00:33:50,278
- Pleased to meet you.
- Likewise.

375
00:33:50,361 --> 00:33:53,156
<i>When I said the drug was too expensive,</i>

376
00:33:55,658 --> 00:33:57,410
<i>the drug dealer said</i>

377
00:33:58,911 --> 00:34:00,038
<i>he's getting the drugs</i>

378
00:34:00,955 --> 00:34:04,459
<i>from the yakuzas in Yoshioka-gumi,</i>

379
00:34:04,542 --> 00:34:06,294
<i>so he couldn't make it any cheaper.</i>

380
00:34:07,962 --> 00:34:12,300
<i>Because that premium-quality product</i>
<i>with 99% purity</i>

381
00:34:12,717 --> 00:34:14,552
<i>is imported from Korea.</i>

382
00:34:15,803 --> 00:34:17,722
<i>Don't worry though.</i>

383
00:34:18,473 --> 00:34:20,850
<i>They say we're going to get</i>

384
00:34:20,933 --> 00:34:23,186
<i>over 10 kg every month from Korea.</i>

385
00:34:23,311 --> 00:34:26,147
<i>That will naturally</i>

386
00:34:27,523 --> 00:34:29,609
<i>result in a price drop.</i>

387
00:34:29,692 --> 00:34:31,819
"It will naturally
result in a price drop."

388
00:34:33,112 --> 00:34:35,073
We freed this drug dealer

389
00:34:35,156 --> 00:34:37,241
in return for these statements,

390
00:34:37,325 --> 00:34:39,202
but he was murdered three days ago.

391
00:34:39,285 --> 00:34:42,288
We suspect it was revenge
from those in Yoshioka-gumi.

392
00:34:45,374 --> 00:34:47,418
Drug trafficking with Japan.

393
00:34:49,754 --> 00:34:52,006
There's a high chance
that it's a Korean gang.

394
00:34:54,133 --> 00:34:55,760
Having the Korean meth cook

395
00:34:55,843 --> 00:34:59,222
and trafficker arrested won't be enough.

396
00:34:59,305 --> 00:35:02,308
There are numerous
Yoshioka-gumi members across Japan.

397
00:35:02,391 --> 00:35:05,228
We must find which member
of which branch in which region

398
00:35:05,311 --> 00:35:07,063
is importing and distributing meth.

399
00:35:07,146 --> 00:35:08,981
And to secure hard evidence,

400
00:35:09,315 --> 00:35:12,360
we'll have to catch
the trafficking at the scene too.

401
00:35:13,986 --> 00:35:15,113
<i>Captain.</i>

402
00:35:15,279 --> 00:35:17,740
<i>Got anyone who suits this case?</i>

403
00:35:17,824 --> 00:35:19,033
EUMSEONG, SOUTH KOREA

404
00:35:19,117 --> 00:35:20,785
<i>Someone tenacious.</i>

405
00:35:20,868 --> 00:35:22,328
<i>A guy that can blend in.</i>

406
00:35:22,787 --> 00:35:25,248
<i>There's a guy I know.</i>

407
00:35:26,124 --> 00:35:27,291
<i>He's a bit wild,</i>

408
00:35:27,792 --> 00:35:28,793
<i>but...</i>

409
00:35:29,168 --> 00:35:30,628
<i>he'll be perfect for this job.</i>

410
00:35:33,214 --> 00:35:34,215
You fucking bastard.

411
00:35:35,299 --> 00:35:36,300
Get off me!

412
00:35:37,844 --> 00:35:39,595
Don't butt in.

413
00:35:48,563 --> 00:35:52,358
Oh.

414
00:35:57,572 --> 00:35:58,698
So refreshing.

415
00:36:04,203 --> 00:36:05,955
Don't you want to go to Seoul?

416
00:36:06,205 --> 00:36:08,249
I visit home once or twice a month.

417
00:36:09,500 --> 00:36:10,710
That's not what I meant.

418
00:36:13,087 --> 00:36:15,756
What do you think of doing
something new in Seoul?

419
00:36:19,719 --> 00:36:22,180
Something you haven't done
and a bit dangerous.

420
00:36:25,558 --> 00:36:27,059
So this is why you're here.

421
00:36:27,560 --> 00:36:28,728
You never come here.

422
00:36:32,857 --> 00:36:34,609
You'll infiltrate their group,

423
00:36:34,692 --> 00:36:38,404
and if you see, hear about,
and take part in the meth moving,

424
00:36:38,487 --> 00:36:40,698
I'm sure we can catch the Japanese too.

425
00:36:41,574 --> 00:36:44,619
So you want me to be a bad guy
to catch bad guys.

426
00:36:44,702 --> 00:36:45,703
Exactly.

427
00:36:46,871 --> 00:36:50,166
Have we ever done
investigations like this before?

428
00:36:56,172 --> 00:36:57,757
Come on.

429
00:36:57,840 --> 00:37:00,218
If you want to catch thugs,

430
00:37:00,301 --> 00:37:03,054
you track them down,
not become one of them.

431
00:37:05,139 --> 00:37:07,934
Come on, we're cops.
That's just mortifying.

432
00:37:08,684 --> 00:37:11,520
And once my wife's family
finds out about this,

433
00:37:11,604 --> 00:37:13,689
they'll say I'm doing something crazy

434
00:37:14,649 --> 00:37:17,026
instead of studying
for the promotion exam.

435
00:37:18,653 --> 00:37:22,448
Billions worth of meth that's enough
to get 330,000 people high

436
00:37:22,531 --> 00:37:24,450
is about to spread across the country.

437
00:37:24,867 --> 00:37:26,077
Think about your father.

438
00:37:33,334 --> 00:37:36,254
When you hate something so much,
you can't even look at it.

439
00:37:40,091 --> 00:37:42,218
Forget it. I'm not doing this.

440
00:37:42,468 --> 00:37:45,930
There are a lot of other cops
who can do this.

441
00:37:56,565 --> 00:37:57,775
How may I help you?

442
00:37:57,900 --> 00:38:00,278
Is Officer Park Junmo here?

443
00:38:00,361 --> 00:38:01,862
Junmo.

444
00:38:05,992 --> 00:38:07,368
He's over there.

445
00:38:07,868 --> 00:38:08,869
What is it?

446
00:38:11,205 --> 00:38:16,085
I heard you and NCID's
Captain Seok Dohyung are like brothers.

447
00:38:16,168 --> 00:38:19,839
A troubled high schooler from Daejeon
who was known for fist fights.

448
00:38:20,464 --> 00:38:24,135
And a kind police officer
who steered him towards the right path.

449
00:38:24,218 --> 00:38:25,636
I asked Captain Seok

450
00:38:25,720 --> 00:38:29,682
to recommend someone suitable
for this investigation,

451
00:38:30,224 --> 00:38:31,851
and he said your name instantly.

452
00:38:31,934 --> 00:38:34,437
I already turned him down though.

453
00:38:36,105 --> 00:38:38,149
Apparently, all the police higher-ups

454
00:38:38,232 --> 00:38:41,402
know about the incident at your wedding.

455
00:38:42,945 --> 00:38:46,949
Even I wouldn't give a promotion

456
00:38:47,033 --> 00:38:48,826
to a drug addict's son.

457
00:39:02,965 --> 00:39:04,800
<i>If this case ends well,</i>

458
00:39:04,884 --> 00:39:07,470
<i>you'll get a sizeable bonus</i>
<i>and a special promotion.</i>

459
00:39:08,804 --> 00:39:10,931
<i>You can't stay in the lower ranks forever.</i>

460
00:39:14,185 --> 00:39:15,895
<i>Officer Park,</i>

461
00:39:15,978 --> 00:39:19,523
<i>chances like this don't come every day.</i>

462
00:39:20,775 --> 00:39:22,610
<i>You can rise through the ranks</i>

463
00:39:23,486 --> 00:39:25,404
<i>with the help of the prosecution.</i>

464
00:39:27,615 --> 00:39:29,950
<i>I mean,</i>
<i>your wife was appointed to Seoul</i>

465
00:39:30,034 --> 00:39:32,161
<i>upon her promotion as assistant inspector.</i>

466
00:39:32,828 --> 00:39:33,829
<i>How great is that?</i>

467
00:39:52,556 --> 00:39:54,058
SOUTHERN SEOUL PLAZA

468
00:41:01,125 --> 00:41:02,126
Please.

469
00:41:26,275 --> 00:41:27,693
I'll do it on one condition.

470
00:41:27,776 --> 00:41:28,777
A condition?

471
00:41:28,986 --> 00:41:30,154
I don't need any bonus.

472
00:41:33,115 --> 00:41:35,409
But I want to move up two ranks.

473
00:41:39,079 --> 00:41:40,664
-Two ranks?
-Yes.

474
00:41:42,416 --> 00:41:46,253
Clearly, I'll be the only one
busting my chops in this case.

475
00:41:47,546 --> 00:41:49,423
I think I deserve that much.

476
00:41:52,426 --> 00:41:54,595
If this ends well,

477
00:41:54,678 --> 00:41:56,680
won't you rise through the ranks?

478
00:41:57,765 --> 00:41:58,891
Why don't you...

479
00:42:00,851 --> 00:42:05,397
rise through the ranks
with the help of a police underling?

480
00:42:13,447 --> 00:42:14,823
Has there been a precedent?

481
00:42:14,907 --> 00:42:16,784
In 1989 for catching Im Jongseok,

482
00:42:16,867 --> 00:42:19,995
the head of the National Council
of Student Representatives.

483
00:42:28,295 --> 00:42:29,296
All right.

484
00:42:41,058 --> 00:42:43,477
<i>Lately, premium-quality meth</i>
<i>with over 95% purity</i>

485
00:42:43,561 --> 00:42:47,106
<i>has been widespread</i>
<i>in Gangnam much like Japan.</i>

486
00:42:47,189 --> 00:42:48,899
<i>Namely, Gangnam Crystal.</i>

487
00:42:48,983 --> 00:42:51,694
<i>We thought it might be linked</i>
<i>to gangsters in Gangnam,</i>

488
00:42:51,777 --> 00:42:53,862
<i>so we did some digging.</i>

489
00:42:53,946 --> 00:42:55,281
<i>Before, Jang Kyungchul,</i>

490
00:42:55,364 --> 00:42:57,950
<i>also known as "Sergeant Jang,"</i>
<i>was the boss of the area.</i>

491
00:42:58,033 --> 00:42:59,702
<i>But Jung Gicheul took him down,</i>

492
00:42:59,785 --> 00:43:02,329
<i>which Busan's Song Donghyuk</i>
<i>turned a blind eye to.</i>

493
00:43:02,413 --> 00:43:05,165
<i>Jung Gicheul</i>
<i>is now the head of Gangnam Union,</i>

494
00:43:05,249 --> 00:43:08,627
<i>and the main members of this new gang</i>
<i>are Yeoksam High graduates.</i>

495
00:43:09,128 --> 00:43:11,797
<i>They've been like brothers</i>
<i>since they were young,</i>

496
00:43:11,880 --> 00:43:13,632
<i>so they have a strong bond</i>
<i>like a family.</i>

497
00:43:13,716 --> 00:43:16,802
<i>So we thought our usual</i>
<i>investigation methods wouldn't work,</i>

498
00:43:16,927 --> 00:43:19,388
<i>which is why we planned this.</i>

499
00:43:20,514 --> 00:43:22,308
<i>When Jung was trying</i>
<i>to get rid of Jang,</i>

500
00:43:22,391 --> 00:43:24,310
<i>one of their members was stabbed to death.</i>

501
00:43:24,602 --> 00:43:25,853
<i>His name was Kwon Taeho.</i>

502
00:43:25,936 --> 00:43:28,564
<i>He was Jung Gicheul's best friend</i>
<i>from high school.</i>

503
00:43:29,398 --> 00:43:32,693
<i>The Gangnam Union members</i>
<i>said Sergeant Jang was the murderer,</i>

504
00:43:32,776 --> 00:43:35,946
<i>but since he went missing,</i>
<i>the case remains unsolved.</i>

505
00:43:37,156 --> 00:43:38,157
<i>Gangnam Union...</i>

506
00:43:38,699 --> 00:43:41,243
<i>Is there anything else</i>
<i>special about them?</i>

507
00:43:41,327 --> 00:43:43,996
<i>Gangnam Union seized power</i>
<i>in Gangnam really quickly.</i>

508
00:43:46,290 --> 00:43:47,458
<i>On the outside,</i>

509
00:43:47,541 --> 00:43:50,919
<i>it almost looks like a social club</i>
<i>for young entrepreneurs.</i>

510
00:43:52,254 --> 00:43:55,883
<i>But during the past six months in Gangnam,</i>

511
00:43:55,966 --> 00:43:58,385
<i>they have taken over</i>
<i>almost every nightclub there.</i>

512
00:43:59,345 --> 00:44:00,971
<i>Where did they get all that money?</i>

513
00:44:01,055 --> 00:44:02,514
KARAOKE, LUCKY DISCO, LUCKY DISCO

514
00:44:02,598 --> 00:44:05,267
<i>I'm sure it has something to do</i>
<i>with Gangnam Crystal.</i>

515
00:44:06,727 --> 00:44:09,647
<i>Junmo, you'll now become</i>
<i>Kwon Taeho's fake cousin</i>

516
00:44:09,730 --> 00:44:11,857
<i>of the same age named Kwon Seungho</i>

517
00:44:11,940 --> 00:44:13,734
<i>and get close to the Gangnam Union.</i>

518
00:44:13,817 --> 00:44:16,695
<i>This is the background</i>
<i>we made up for Kwon Seungho.</i>

519
00:44:16,779 --> 00:44:18,739
<i>He works in a fishing crew.</i>

520
00:44:19,156 --> 00:44:20,157
Kwon Seungho.

521
00:44:20,240 --> 00:44:23,077
<i>I'll take care of his backstory</i>
<i>in advance.</i>

522
00:44:23,160 --> 00:44:24,161
<i>Don't worry about that.</i>

523
00:44:24,244 --> 00:44:26,246
<i>You know Sikgaek</i>
<i>in Yeoksam-dong?</i>

524
00:44:26,914 --> 00:44:29,583
<i>They recently took over that business.</i>

525
00:44:30,042 --> 00:44:33,003
<i>Some of the members have dinner there</i>
<i>multiple times a week,</i>

526
00:44:33,087 --> 00:44:34,963
<i>and we suspect they're the higher-ups.</i>

527
00:44:35,881 --> 00:44:38,342
<i>Security is key</i>
<i>to the success of this operation.</i>

528
00:44:38,425 --> 00:44:41,553
<i>There might be cops</i>
<i>who are close with the gangsters,</i>

529
00:44:41,637 --> 00:44:43,722
<i>so let's keep it discreet from the start.</i>

530
00:44:43,806 --> 00:44:44,807
Hey.

531
00:44:46,058 --> 00:44:48,644
You're taking sick leave
when you look so healthy?

532
00:44:50,396 --> 00:44:51,397
Junmo.

533
00:44:51,897 --> 00:44:52,898
Are you okay?

534
00:44:52,981 --> 00:44:53,982
Hey.

535
00:44:55,526 --> 00:44:57,361
-Take care, okay?
-Okay.

536
00:44:57,444 --> 00:44:58,904
Get well soon.

537
00:44:58,987 --> 00:45:00,030
Asthma?

538
00:45:01,865 --> 00:45:04,201
Gangnam Union's boss, Jung Gicheul.

539
00:45:06,662 --> 00:45:08,539
According to his travel records,

540
00:45:08,622 --> 00:45:10,290
in the past six months,

541
00:45:10,374 --> 00:45:12,543
he's visited Japan and China twice.

542
00:45:15,587 --> 00:45:16,588
China?

543
00:45:17,131 --> 00:45:19,800
If they're cooking
Gangnam Crystal themselves,

544
00:45:19,883 --> 00:45:23,971
they might be buying the ingredient,
ephedrine, from China.

545
00:45:25,848 --> 00:45:27,850
<i>Gangnam Union and Jung Gicheul.</i>

546
00:45:29,435 --> 00:45:32,396
<i>The worst drug crime in Korean history.</i>

547
00:45:36,108 --> 00:45:37,234
Now, let's think about

548
00:45:38,193 --> 00:45:40,237
how Kwon Seongho

549
00:45:40,320 --> 00:45:42,656
should first approach Jung Gicheul.

550
00:45:44,283 --> 00:45:45,826
Let me try my way.

551
00:45:49,538 --> 00:45:51,498
GANGNAM UNION
JUNG GICHEUL

552
00:46:16,648 --> 00:46:19,026
SIKGAEK

553
00:46:32,498 --> 00:46:35,000
Sir, you need to order.

554
00:46:35,375 --> 00:46:37,044
I'm not here to eat.

555
00:46:38,712 --> 00:46:40,380
Bring me the owner.

556
00:46:40,464 --> 00:46:42,591
I'm the owner. I'm not sure what you mean.

557
00:46:44,009 --> 00:46:46,804
I know Gangnam Union took over this place.

558
00:46:46,887 --> 00:46:48,597
Isn't Jung Gicheul the owner?

559
00:46:49,097 --> 00:46:50,474
Bring me Jung Gicheul.

560
00:46:51,975 --> 00:46:52,976
Hurry.

561
00:46:53,560 --> 00:46:54,561
He's over there.

562
00:46:59,066 --> 00:47:00,067
Who are you?

563
00:47:00,567 --> 00:47:03,237
We have customers,
so stand up quietly and leave.

564
00:47:05,155 --> 00:47:08,242
If I stand up,
you'll be lying down, you rats.

565
00:47:08,534 --> 00:47:11,703
Just bring Jung Gicheul to me already.

566
00:47:12,538 --> 00:47:13,664
What?

567
00:47:14,998 --> 00:47:17,167
Damn it. Fine.

568
00:47:19,169 --> 00:47:20,254
You fucking...

569
00:47:24,716 --> 00:47:25,717
Fuck.

570
00:47:28,053 --> 00:47:31,682
Boss, why don't we eat
somewhere other than Sikgaek today?

571
00:47:31,765 --> 00:47:33,058
Why?

572
00:47:33,433 --> 00:47:35,477
Bring Jung Gicheul to me.

573
00:47:35,811 --> 00:47:37,396
Bring the owner here.

574
00:47:38,313 --> 00:47:39,648
Do you hear me?

575
00:47:39,731 --> 00:47:41,483
Go and get Jung Gicheul.

576
00:47:41,692 --> 00:47:44,278
Apparently, some nut
is causing a scene there.

577
00:47:44,361 --> 00:47:47,030
I'll go take care of it
after we have dinner.

578
00:47:48,240 --> 00:47:49,241
Who is he?

579
00:47:49,324 --> 00:47:53,370
SIKGAEK

580
00:47:57,833 --> 00:47:59,501
No, stop!

581
00:47:59,585 --> 00:48:00,878
Don't throw that.

582
00:48:02,588 --> 00:48:04,256
He wants to speak to Gicheul.

583
00:48:05,757 --> 00:48:06,884
Me?

584
00:48:06,967 --> 00:48:08,010
Yes, Boss.

585
00:48:08,468 --> 00:48:09,553
Why?

586
00:48:09,636 --> 00:48:11,597
You know those guys never tell you why.

587
00:48:11,680 --> 00:48:12,764
Just forget it.

588
00:48:14,224 --> 00:48:15,809
Who the fuck is this?

589
00:48:19,730 --> 00:48:20,981
Fucking idiots.

590
00:48:21,607 --> 00:48:22,858
Hey, bring your boss.

591
00:48:29,031 --> 00:48:30,115
Let's go and check.

592
00:48:31,199 --> 00:48:33,535
Crazy people need some education
on etiquette.

593
00:48:36,330 --> 00:48:38,040
Bring Jung Gicheul here!

594
00:48:44,254 --> 00:48:45,547
Let's go.

595
00:49:18,914 --> 00:49:20,540
I heard you were looking for me.

596
00:49:24,169 --> 00:49:28,131
Why is it so damn hard to meet you?

597
00:49:31,510 --> 00:49:34,846
Hey.

598
00:49:37,432 --> 00:49:38,850
Are you Jung Gicheul?

599
00:49:50,529 --> 00:49:52,447
Get your hand off me, you fuck.

600
00:50:04,501 --> 00:50:05,669
Who are you?
