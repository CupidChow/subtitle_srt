1
00:00:01,710 --> 00:00:08,717
THE CHARACTERS, PLACES, ORGANIZATIONS AND
EVENTS IN THIS DRAMA ARE WORKS OF FICTION

2
00:00:12,554 --> 00:00:14,764
I confirmed
he went into the police station.

3
00:00:15,015 --> 00:00:18,018
But with obstruction of justice
and assaulting a officer,

4
00:00:18,226 --> 00:00:19,310
it won't be easy.

5
00:00:20,437 --> 00:00:22,063
Try asking around more.

6
00:00:22,147 --> 00:00:23,148
Yes, Boss.

7
00:00:23,231 --> 00:00:26,067
Also, find out what Hwang Mingoo
is suspecting us of.

8
00:00:26,151 --> 00:00:27,152
Yes, Boss.

9
00:00:39,497 --> 00:00:40,707
Hey.

10
00:00:40,832 --> 00:00:44,502
So it seems you used to be an athlete...

11
00:00:44,586 --> 00:00:46,046
But you're just a thug.

12
00:00:46,129 --> 00:00:48,256
Forget your place
and cross the line with cops,

13
00:00:48,339 --> 00:00:51,342
and you could get yourself killed.

14
00:00:53,219 --> 00:00:54,304
Did you just laugh?

15
00:00:55,263 --> 00:00:59,559
Is the Korean police a joke to you?

16
00:00:59,976 --> 00:01:01,102
All right.

17
00:01:01,186 --> 00:01:03,813
How about I take off my badge
and we go at it, you fuck?

18
00:01:03,897 --> 00:01:06,733
-Calm down, sir.
-Let's do it, motherfucker.

19
00:01:06,816 --> 00:01:08,068
Come on, you bastard!

20
00:01:08,151 --> 00:01:10,028
-Let go.
-Calm down, sir.

21
00:01:10,111 --> 00:01:11,905
You better watch your attitude.

22
00:01:11,988 --> 00:01:13,740
Or you want to go straight to jail?

23
00:01:13,823 --> 00:01:15,075
Well, as you can see,

24
00:01:15,575 --> 00:01:17,577
I'm here to turn myself in.

25
00:01:18,703 --> 00:01:20,997
Move. Is that so?

26
00:01:21,581 --> 00:01:23,333
If you came to turn yourself in,

27
00:01:23,416 --> 00:01:27,128
lift your head and list all your crimes.

28
00:01:28,880 --> 00:01:33,635
I forgot my place and crossed the line

29
00:01:33,718 --> 00:01:35,762
by assaulting a civil servant of Korea.

30
00:01:35,845 --> 00:01:36,846
I'm sorry.

31
00:01:38,473 --> 00:01:41,851
I told you to fucking list your crimes,
not apologize.

32
00:01:45,522 --> 00:01:47,315
I'm willing to accept any punishment.

33
00:01:47,440 --> 00:01:48,775
Enough with the bullshit.

34
00:01:49,818 --> 00:01:53,404
Now, tell me who those people
in the hotel room were.

35
00:01:53,488 --> 00:01:55,532
You see,

36
00:01:55,657 --> 00:02:00,036
I'm not interested
in fucking nobodies like you, okay?

37
00:02:00,787 --> 00:02:03,748
So tell me who those fuckers were.

38
00:02:03,832 --> 00:02:06,793
The ones who came out of the hotel room
with Jung Gicheul.

39
00:02:06,876 --> 00:02:07,919
Who is this?

40
00:02:08,002 --> 00:02:09,254
Who the fuck are they?

41
00:02:09,337 --> 00:02:10,880
-I don't know.
-Hey.

42
00:02:11,422 --> 00:02:14,175
Stop trying to take the fall
and tell me the truth.

43
00:02:14,259 --> 00:02:15,844
Who are they?

44
00:02:15,927 --> 00:02:18,847
I'm a fucking nobody,
so I don't know anything.

45
00:02:18,930 --> 00:02:20,223
All I know is...

46
00:02:20,306 --> 00:02:22,934
that they're my boss' investors.

47
00:02:23,017 --> 00:02:24,185
That's all.

48
00:02:24,269 --> 00:02:27,355
Come on. Who invests in a thug?

49
00:02:27,438 --> 00:02:30,066
Also, why would investors run away then?

50
00:02:30,859 --> 00:02:32,152
Look, Detective.

51
00:02:33,903 --> 00:02:35,655
It would be strange not to run away

52
00:02:35,738 --> 00:02:38,199
from an approaching cop
who's yelling like crazy.

53
00:02:38,283 --> 00:02:40,243
What the hell did you just say?

54
00:02:40,326 --> 00:02:41,953
Say that again. What?

55
00:02:44,330 --> 00:02:46,207
It seems like you were
quite an athlete too.

56
00:02:47,250 --> 00:02:49,711
Let's be honest.
If you're a former athlete,

57
00:02:49,794 --> 00:02:52,172
you either end up as a thug or a cop.

58
00:02:52,255 --> 00:02:53,256
And?

59
00:02:54,799 --> 00:02:57,343
We're basically the same people.

60
00:02:57,427 --> 00:03:00,054
You were just a little luckier

61
00:03:00,138 --> 00:03:02,807
to be in that position right now.

62
00:03:03,683 --> 00:03:06,895
Come on, Detective. Look at you.

63
00:03:06,978 --> 00:03:09,355
You're acting like a thug now.

64
00:03:09,439 --> 00:03:10,773
Jeez.

65
00:03:10,857 --> 00:03:12,942
You should be ashamed, you asshole.

66
00:03:13,026 --> 00:03:14,903
Seriously, sir. Let go of me.

67
00:03:14,986 --> 00:03:16,446
That's it, you asshole.

68
00:03:16,529 --> 00:03:19,115
You fucking son of a bitch.

69
00:03:19,199 --> 00:03:21,242
Come here, you motherfucker.

70
00:03:21,326 --> 00:03:24,954
-Sir.
-You God damn motherfucker.

71
00:03:25,038 --> 00:03:26,372
-Sir.
-Come here, you fuck.

72
00:03:27,248 --> 00:03:28,416
You motherfucker!

73
00:03:28,499 --> 00:03:29,626
Stop it, sir.

74
00:03:29,709 --> 00:03:31,002
-Stop.
-Let go.

75
00:03:31,085 --> 00:03:33,254
You God damn son of a bitch.

76
00:03:33,755 --> 00:03:35,006
Fucking bastard.

77
00:03:35,089 --> 00:03:37,342
Let go, you bastard!

78
00:03:37,425 --> 00:03:39,219
Come here.

79
00:03:39,302 --> 00:03:43,598
You think you can block
my punches, you fucker?

80
00:03:43,681 --> 00:03:46,684
Fucking bastard!

81
00:03:49,020 --> 00:03:52,649
You're blocking my punches,
you motherfucker?

82
00:03:52,732 --> 00:03:54,317
How dare you?

83
00:03:54,400 --> 00:03:58,029
You damn motherfucker!

84
00:03:58,112 --> 00:04:01,282
-How dare you?
-I said stop!

85
00:04:07,121 --> 00:04:09,707
Let go of me, you bastard! Hey!

86
00:04:25,932 --> 00:04:32,522
THE WORST OF EVIL

87
00:04:40,613 --> 00:04:44,033
All right. Let's get back to it.

88
00:04:44,951 --> 00:04:45,952
Hey.

89
00:04:47,996 --> 00:04:49,247
Who were those people?

90
00:04:49,330 --> 00:04:51,332
Fuck, I don't know.

91
00:04:52,542 --> 00:04:57,088
God damn it.
You damn son of a bitch.

92
00:04:57,880 --> 00:05:00,675
You still think I'm a joke, don't you?

93
00:05:00,758 --> 00:05:04,345
What? You're going to hit me again?

94
00:05:05,847 --> 00:05:07,765
Go on and hit me.

95
00:05:07,849 --> 00:05:09,350
Just kill me, asshole.

96
00:05:09,434 --> 00:05:12,729
All right. Die, you motherfucker.

97
00:05:12,812 --> 00:05:14,314
What is going on here?

98
00:05:34,792 --> 00:05:38,963
Does this happen often
in Gangnam Police Station?

99
00:05:39,047 --> 00:05:40,465
No, sir.

100
00:05:40,548 --> 00:05:42,759
Absolutely not.

101
00:05:42,842 --> 00:05:44,427
Sir.

102
00:05:44,510 --> 00:05:47,847
May I ask what brought you here
without any prior notice?

103
00:05:47,930 --> 00:05:51,726
Right. I have some information to share
regarding a murder case.

104
00:05:54,187 --> 00:05:56,689
I heard you were
in the middle of an investigation.

105
00:06:00,943 --> 00:06:03,696
Yes, sir. I was investigating
a missing drug dealer

106
00:06:03,780 --> 00:06:05,323
called Manager Cho.

107
00:06:06,449 --> 00:06:08,242
I think this may be the same case.

108
00:06:10,036 --> 00:06:13,206
I don't think I can help an officer
who commits assault though.

109
00:06:14,957 --> 00:06:18,086
I suppose I should report
that assault from moments ago, right?

110
00:06:18,795 --> 00:06:20,880
Please, sir.

111
00:06:20,963 --> 00:06:22,757
We're so sorry for what happened.

112
00:06:27,845 --> 00:06:31,516
I'll make sure
to thoroughly discipline my officers.

113
00:06:31,891 --> 00:06:34,060
So please let it slide just this once.

114
00:06:35,937 --> 00:06:36,938
Hey.

115
00:06:37,522 --> 00:06:39,232
I'll be more careful.

116
00:07:04,841 --> 00:07:06,217
Here.

117
00:07:11,013 --> 00:07:13,516
God damn it.

118
00:07:13,599 --> 00:07:14,684
What happened?

119
00:07:15,017 --> 00:07:18,688
They asked me to sign a paper
saying I wouldn't sue for being hit.

120
00:07:18,771 --> 00:07:21,149
They said if I forgot
about the cop hitting me,

121
00:07:21,232 --> 00:07:22,442
they would free me.

122
00:07:26,070 --> 00:07:27,613
Hey.

123
00:07:27,697 --> 00:07:28,698
Yes?

124
00:07:29,031 --> 00:07:30,616
You know everything now, right?

125
00:07:32,785 --> 00:07:33,786
Know what?

126
00:07:33,870 --> 00:07:35,496
You saw everything in the hotel.

127
00:07:35,580 --> 00:07:37,498
What's Boss doing?

128
00:07:38,040 --> 00:07:39,459
And what's this deal with China?

129
00:07:40,084 --> 00:07:43,337
Why the fuck did he have to
bring you instead of me?

130
00:07:49,051 --> 00:07:50,970
Well, it's drug-related so...

131
00:07:51,846 --> 00:07:53,848
You know my father is a junkie, right?

132
00:07:55,016 --> 00:07:57,351
So it's an area I know well.

133
00:07:58,102 --> 00:07:59,770
I fucking knew it.

134
00:08:01,898 --> 00:08:03,900
Only those three higher-ups are in this.

135
00:08:04,275 --> 00:08:06,027
We should join them too, Chief Seo.

136
00:08:06,944 --> 00:08:08,196
You wanted to make big money.

137
00:08:08,279 --> 00:08:11,115
They have to fucking let me in
to make big money.

138
00:08:11,199 --> 00:08:13,534
We've got to push our way in somehow.

139
00:08:14,702 --> 00:08:15,995
Fuck, if we can't,

140
00:08:16,746 --> 00:08:17,955
we'll push someone out.

141
00:08:21,626 --> 00:08:22,835
Are you serious?

142
00:08:22,919 --> 00:08:25,463
I'm just saying you deserve it.

143
00:08:26,130 --> 00:08:29,133
You do all the hard work.

144
00:08:29,967 --> 00:08:31,969
Seriously, this is fucking unfair.

145
00:08:32,762 --> 00:08:35,389
You deserve lots of money.

146
00:08:46,359 --> 00:08:47,360
Here.

147
00:08:49,445 --> 00:08:50,446
Well done.

148
00:08:51,364 --> 00:08:52,365
Thank you.

149
00:08:57,578 --> 00:08:59,914
He was really lucky, by the way.

150
00:09:00,373 --> 00:09:02,583
He was getting beaten up by Hwang Mingoo,

151
00:09:02,667 --> 00:09:05,836
and the Chief Prosecutor
just happened to show up then.

152
00:09:05,920 --> 00:09:09,173
Could it be that your lady cop friend

153
00:09:09,298 --> 00:09:12,385
gave him a heads-up?

154
00:09:12,760 --> 00:09:15,346
Hey, are you upset
Seungho got freed or what?

155
00:09:15,805 --> 00:09:19,725
Look. There were detectives
who were undercover in that hotel.

156
00:09:19,809 --> 00:09:21,894
What are you talking about?

157
00:09:21,978 --> 00:09:23,312
Did you see them?

158
00:09:23,396 --> 00:09:26,274
It's just my gut feeling.

159
00:09:26,357 --> 00:09:28,276
Your gut feeling?

160
00:09:29,235 --> 00:09:30,278
Jeez.

161
00:09:30,820 --> 00:09:33,698
Well, you've always had good intuitions.

162
00:09:33,781 --> 00:09:36,117
Why didn't you check it yourself then?

163
00:09:36,242 --> 00:09:39,579
I can't just walk up to them
and ask, "Are you a cop?"

164
00:09:40,288 --> 00:09:41,497
You have a point.

165
00:09:41,581 --> 00:09:43,332
Those fuckers always stick out.

166
00:09:45,334 --> 00:09:48,462
Somehow, wherever you go,
there were always civil servants.

167
00:09:48,546 --> 00:09:51,632
Undercover cops, a prosecutor,

168
00:09:51,716 --> 00:09:53,467
and that lady friend of yours.

169
00:09:53,551 --> 00:09:55,553
The cop from the Security Division.

170
00:09:56,762 --> 00:09:57,930
Jungbae.

171
00:09:58,014 --> 00:09:59,015
Yes, sir?

172
00:09:59,098 --> 00:10:00,725
What's so suspicious?

173
00:10:01,684 --> 00:10:02,852
Well, you know.

174
00:10:03,436 --> 00:10:05,980
No one gets off so easily
after hitting a cop.

175
00:10:06,063 --> 00:10:08,524
So are you saying
the cops have Seungho's back?

176
00:10:09,650 --> 00:10:12,028
Well, I'm sure that's not the case,

177
00:10:12,111 --> 00:10:14,030
but something's just off.

178
00:10:15,114 --> 00:10:17,408
Seungho dealt with this on your behalf.

179
00:10:20,953 --> 00:10:23,331
Enough about that.
Let's just enjoy our drinks.

180
00:10:28,628 --> 00:10:30,087
-Jungbae.
-Yes, sir?

181
00:10:30,963 --> 00:10:33,841
This month's ledger seemed
to have a lot of gaps.

182
00:10:34,467 --> 00:10:35,676
You should sort that out.

183
00:10:36,886 --> 00:10:38,638
Yes, Boss. I will.

184
00:11:01,619 --> 00:11:04,038
Jungbae is in charge
of the company's books,

185
00:11:04,747 --> 00:11:06,957
so he's very meticulous.
Hope you understand.

186
00:11:13,631 --> 00:11:15,091
Boss.

187
00:11:15,174 --> 00:11:17,677
How did it go with the Chinese?

188
00:11:18,719 --> 00:11:20,179
We're still stuck.

189
00:11:23,182 --> 00:11:24,558
How about you talk to them?

190
00:11:25,685 --> 00:11:26,686
Pardon?

191
00:11:26,769 --> 00:11:28,688
The Chinese woman seemed to like you.

192
00:11:29,730 --> 00:11:31,357
Why don't you meet her and talk?

193
00:11:31,440 --> 00:11:33,025
What are you talking about?

194
00:11:33,776 --> 00:11:36,362
I know Seungho's smart
and gets things done,

195
00:11:36,445 --> 00:11:38,406
but it's too early.

196
00:11:40,157 --> 00:11:43,577
Especially when it's something
so important as this.

197
00:11:44,161 --> 00:11:47,331
I think you should do it yourself.

198
00:11:48,332 --> 00:11:51,085
You have to be on the same level
to be able to talk.

199
00:11:51,585 --> 00:11:55,214
Those ungrateful bastards
from China and Japan don't remember

200
00:11:57,049 --> 00:11:59,343
they were able to make
big money thanks to me.

201
00:12:00,678 --> 00:12:02,471
They looked down on me and insulted me.

202
00:12:04,014 --> 00:12:05,850
Those motherfuckers.

203
00:12:05,933 --> 00:12:09,270
Let me take care of this, Boss.

204
00:12:10,438 --> 00:12:12,440
I'll get those bastards who insulted you

205
00:12:13,232 --> 00:12:15,234
and take care of all of them.

206
00:12:17,695 --> 00:12:19,447
Let's talk about this later

207
00:12:19,530 --> 00:12:21,949
when Jungbae is around, okay?

208
00:12:22,032 --> 00:12:24,368
All right. Let's drink.

209
00:12:24,452 --> 00:12:27,079
Kwon Seungho, you did a great job.

210
00:12:36,797 --> 00:12:40,009
And if you're with a drug dealer or not.

211
00:12:42,511 --> 00:12:44,221
<i>There's nothing you can do</i>
<i>right now.</i>

212
00:12:44,513 --> 00:12:48,684
Your Japanese father is acting
like he's the king.

213
00:12:51,896 --> 00:12:53,105
You don't want to do it?

214
00:12:54,398 --> 00:12:57,067
Then, our deal is over.

215
00:13:07,036 --> 00:13:08,037
Hello?

216
00:13:11,081 --> 00:13:12,249
Hey, Euijeong.

217
00:13:13,125 --> 00:13:17,087
LEE AND BODYGUARD

218
00:13:17,630 --> 00:13:20,841
I sent information on their fake passports
to the Chinese police,

219
00:13:20,925 --> 00:13:23,093
so they'll start an investigation too.

220
00:13:25,304 --> 00:13:27,473
Okay, we're almost there.

221
00:13:28,265 --> 00:13:30,810
Now, we know what both Japan
and China are up to.

222
00:13:31,143 --> 00:13:32,978
We can see everything they're up to.

223
00:13:34,230 --> 00:13:36,482
Why don't we just arrest them all now?

224
00:13:36,565 --> 00:13:38,025
Of course, we can't.

225
00:13:39,109 --> 00:13:43,072
What if this woman called Miss Lee
shuts down the drug production factory?

226
00:13:43,656 --> 00:13:47,660
What if the Japanese insist they were
buying eyeglass frames or fake watches?

227
00:13:48,744 --> 00:13:53,123
Then, we'd only be able to charge
Jung Gicheul with murder. That's it.

228
00:13:54,041 --> 00:13:56,961
We have one last step left.

229
00:13:59,588 --> 00:14:02,675
Catching them at the scene
of the deal with evidence.

230
00:14:02,758 --> 00:14:05,344
But the thing is
their trade is about to end.

231
00:14:06,428 --> 00:14:09,765
No way. We must get it going again.

232
00:14:09,849 --> 00:14:11,308
God damn it.

233
00:14:11,392 --> 00:14:15,855
All right.
I'll talk with the Chinese woman.

234
00:14:17,398 --> 00:14:21,318
So I want you to take care
of Choi Jungbae.

235
00:14:21,402 --> 00:14:23,195
He's the one who suspects me the most,

236
00:14:23,612 --> 00:14:25,739
and I have no idea what he'll do about it.

237
00:14:27,449 --> 00:14:30,369
We should remove him
from Jung Gicheul as soon as we can.

238
00:14:35,165 --> 00:14:37,084
Something's been bothering you lately.

239
00:14:41,505 --> 00:14:42,506
Can you tell?

240
00:14:42,590 --> 00:14:45,426
You were always quiet
when things were tough.

241
00:14:48,470 --> 00:14:50,598
Whatever it is,

242
00:14:50,681 --> 00:14:52,516
I'm sure you'll overcome it.

243
00:14:53,392 --> 00:14:55,269
Just like you always have.

244
00:14:55,352 --> 00:14:58,689
Back in the day,
we used to meet at night like this

245
00:14:59,732 --> 00:15:03,068
and talk about all sorts
of things. Remember?

246
00:15:05,321 --> 00:15:07,615
Right. We did.

247
00:15:13,203 --> 00:15:14,914
By any chance,

248
00:15:17,041 --> 00:15:19,919
if there's anything
I can help you with, tell me.

249
00:15:21,086 --> 00:15:22,463
Why?

250
00:15:22,546 --> 00:15:23,547
What?

251
00:15:24,089 --> 00:15:25,549
Do you want to help me?

252
00:15:29,094 --> 00:15:30,095
Did you help...

253
00:15:30,846 --> 00:15:32,097
Seungho too?

254
00:15:33,807 --> 00:15:35,184
What do you mean?

255
00:15:38,020 --> 00:15:39,021
Nothing.

256
00:15:42,232 --> 00:15:44,902
Talking with you makes me feel better.

257
00:16:00,334 --> 00:16:01,752
Euijeong.

258
00:16:01,835 --> 00:16:02,920
Yes?

259
00:16:04,755 --> 00:16:05,965
How do you deal with it

260
00:16:06,966 --> 00:16:08,509
when you miss your mother?

261
00:16:09,051 --> 00:16:10,177
I don't deal with it.

262
00:16:11,095 --> 00:16:14,390
I just let myself feel sad.

263
00:16:17,893 --> 00:16:20,396
It was nice talking with you.
Get back home safely.

264
00:16:21,522 --> 00:16:22,815
-Have a good night.
-All right.

265
00:16:39,915 --> 00:16:41,083
Hi.

266
00:16:49,967 --> 00:16:51,719
-Have you eaten yet?
-Well...

267
00:16:51,802 --> 00:16:53,178
No, not yet.

268
00:16:53,804 --> 00:16:54,847
For you.

269
00:16:55,681 --> 00:16:58,308
Oh, my goodness.

270
00:17:08,819 --> 00:17:09,945
Thanks for the food.

271
00:17:15,242 --> 00:17:16,243
It's really good.

272
00:17:22,458 --> 00:17:24,043
Why aren't you going to church?

273
00:17:28,547 --> 00:17:29,673
Are you ashamed of me?

274
00:17:30,716 --> 00:17:33,427
Don't talk like that.

275
00:17:33,510 --> 00:17:35,637
What kind of mother is ashamed of her son?

276
00:17:42,811 --> 00:17:44,354
Then, could you do me a favor?

277
00:17:45,898 --> 00:17:47,775
TAE-HO ROCK CAFE

278
00:17:59,203 --> 00:18:01,038
TAEHO

279
00:18:50,295 --> 00:18:51,797
How can I help you?

280
00:20:24,223 --> 00:20:25,891
<i>Hello?</i>

281
00:20:25,974 --> 00:20:27,601
Hello?

282
00:20:27,684 --> 00:20:28,727
<i>Yes?</i>

283
00:20:28,810 --> 00:20:30,896
Hello, this is Kwon Seungho.

284
00:20:30,979 --> 00:20:33,607
We met at the hotel the other day.

285
00:20:33,690 --> 00:20:36,360
<i>Right. Looks like you got it sorted out.</i>

286
00:21:08,558 --> 00:21:09,893
Hey, what are you doing?

287
00:21:12,396 --> 00:21:14,982
You think I'm hiding
a fucking bomb or something?

288
00:21:17,234 --> 00:21:21,071
Right. He can't speak Korean.

289
00:21:32,958 --> 00:21:35,627
Man, I was wondering how you got free.

290
00:21:37,838 --> 00:21:40,674
Did you sort it out by getting beaten up?

291
00:21:47,014 --> 00:21:48,015
Hey.

292
00:21:54,813 --> 00:21:58,525
Take good care of her, okay?

293
00:22:03,697 --> 00:22:07,951
So that bastard can speak Korean.

294
00:22:11,955 --> 00:22:13,457
Are you coming from the hotel?

295
00:22:14,791 --> 00:22:17,336
Maybe, maybe not.

296
00:22:17,419 --> 00:22:18,420
I see.

297
00:22:20,172 --> 00:22:21,214
Where do you want to go?

298
00:22:21,548 --> 00:22:24,676
Somewhere with a lot of land and houses.

299
00:22:33,935 --> 00:22:34,936
Who is it?

300
00:22:35,020 --> 00:22:37,147
<i>I'm here</i>
<i>to request your service.</i>

301
00:22:37,522 --> 00:22:38,648
We're closed.

302
00:22:39,358 --> 00:22:40,484
<i>You know me, sir.</i>

303
00:22:40,567 --> 00:22:42,235
<i>I'm in Boss Jung Gicheul's gang.</i>

304
00:22:50,660 --> 00:22:52,037
What brings you here?

305
00:22:52,704 --> 00:22:55,707
I'm not here
to ask for something difficult.

306
00:22:55,791 --> 00:22:59,669
Remember the woman
my boss asked you to check?

307
00:22:59,753 --> 00:23:01,963
I'd just like to know

308
00:23:02,756 --> 00:23:04,091
a little more about her.

309
00:23:05,425 --> 00:23:06,426
More in what way?

310
00:23:06,510 --> 00:23:10,138
We have this new kid called Kwon Seungho.

311
00:23:10,222 --> 00:23:12,849
He says he went
to the same school with Yu Euijeong.

312
00:23:12,933 --> 00:23:14,976
I want to know if it's true.

313
00:23:15,060 --> 00:23:17,562
I also want to know
if she'd really lived in Wonju.

314
00:23:18,522 --> 00:23:21,525
And if she did, did she really live
next door to Kwon Seungho?

315
00:23:28,490 --> 00:23:31,284
I can see you're not
very comfortable with my request.

316
00:23:36,164 --> 00:23:39,000
I'll give you three times more
once you confirm these.

317
00:24:24,546 --> 00:24:25,839
Hello, this is Cheon.

318
00:24:26,923 --> 00:24:28,592
One of your boys visited me.

319
00:24:28,675 --> 00:24:29,676
Choi Jungbae, right?

320
00:24:29,759 --> 00:24:31,428
Yes, it was him.

321
00:24:32,012 --> 00:24:33,513
Did you mention the other ledger?

322
00:24:34,514 --> 00:24:37,058
You know I only work with you, sir.

323
00:24:37,684 --> 00:24:39,019
I didn't.

324
00:25:09,591 --> 00:25:11,384
You're here as a tour guide.

325
00:25:11,468 --> 00:25:13,762
Aren't you supposed to explain things?

326
00:25:15,096 --> 00:25:17,432
Right. Well...

327
00:25:22,354 --> 00:25:23,605
Well, that is...

328
00:25:24,314 --> 00:25:26,483
a tile-roofed house
from the Joseon Dynasty.

329
00:25:27,150 --> 00:25:28,235
I see.

330
00:25:34,574 --> 00:25:35,575
Then, are these...

331
00:25:36,785 --> 00:25:38,370
carps from the Joseon Dynasty?

332
00:25:39,788 --> 00:25:42,666
Well, this is a pond
from the Joseon Dynasty, so...

333
00:25:51,550 --> 00:25:54,719
Didn't you say you wanted
to check out the real estate?

334
00:25:54,803 --> 00:25:57,430
Tile-roofed houses are real estate too.

335
00:26:02,310 --> 00:26:04,437
Are you sure you didn't come here

336
00:26:04,521 --> 00:26:05,981
to see if someone was tailing us?

337
00:26:13,697 --> 00:26:16,157
I thought you only used
your brawn to do things,

338
00:26:17,450 --> 00:26:18,743
but you've got brains too.

339
00:26:19,536 --> 00:26:21,204
Are you done checking now?

340
00:26:27,460 --> 00:26:29,296
How about we go eat something nice?

341
00:26:31,631 --> 00:26:33,341
Some really tasty local food.

342
00:27:27,062 --> 00:27:30,649
Seungho,
you don't seem like a gangster.

343
00:27:30,732 --> 00:27:32,192
You're more like a soldier.

344
00:27:34,527 --> 00:27:37,113
Then, don't think of me as a gangster.

345
00:27:37,906 --> 00:27:39,532
Just think of me

346
00:27:39,616 --> 00:27:43,078
as an aspiring entrepreneur.

347
00:27:45,497 --> 00:27:46,498
May I ask

348
00:27:48,166 --> 00:27:50,335
where in China you're from?

349
00:27:51,127 --> 00:27:54,381
Mmm... Guess.

350
00:27:56,383 --> 00:27:57,384
Shanghai?

351
00:27:59,094 --> 00:28:00,095
Beijing?

352
00:28:02,222 --> 00:28:03,640
Then...

353
00:28:05,892 --> 00:28:07,477
Before I see you next time,

354
00:28:07,560 --> 00:28:10,146
I'll make sure to study up
on Chinese geography.

355
00:28:15,318 --> 00:28:17,779
Why are you so loyal
to Mr. Jung to the extent...

356
00:28:18,780 --> 00:28:20,281
of risking your own life?

357
00:28:27,914 --> 00:28:28,915
Right.

358
00:28:30,834 --> 00:28:31,835
I'm not sure.

359
00:28:32,877 --> 00:28:33,878
I just...

360
00:28:36,464 --> 00:28:37,549
feel like it.

361
00:28:39,551 --> 00:28:40,760
You feel like it?

362
00:28:41,511 --> 00:28:43,513
-Yes.
-Well, I thought

363
00:28:43,596 --> 00:28:45,849
he was buying you a building or something.

364
00:28:46,641 --> 00:28:47,767
No.

365
00:28:50,353 --> 00:28:52,897
I just really look up to him,

366
00:28:52,981 --> 00:28:54,107
and I like him.

367
00:28:54,899 --> 00:28:57,527
And my body follows my heart.

368
00:28:58,778 --> 00:29:00,488
What a romantic guy.

369
00:29:01,448 --> 00:29:03,158
Is that a bad thing?

370
00:29:04,117 --> 00:29:09,164
No, it's not bad.
I just find it interesting.

371
00:29:10,623 --> 00:29:12,000
It's unusual.

372
00:29:19,007 --> 00:29:20,175
Right.

373
00:29:20,258 --> 00:29:22,927
I don't know your name yet.

374
00:29:28,183 --> 00:29:29,350
Lee Haeryun.

375
00:29:31,644 --> 00:29:34,522
How should I address you?

376
00:29:34,606 --> 00:29:36,983
You can call me whatever you like.

377
00:29:47,577 --> 00:29:49,120
Haeryun.

378
00:29:49,204 --> 00:29:51,331
Are you going to continue
the trade with Mr. Jung?

379
00:29:52,373 --> 00:29:54,959
This recent accident
will never happen again.

380
00:29:55,460 --> 00:29:58,463
I'll stay by Mr. Jung and make sure of it.

381
00:30:01,716 --> 00:30:03,218
Bring it in.

382
00:30:17,232 --> 00:30:20,109
Our people working
in the nightlife business here

383
00:30:20,193 --> 00:30:22,487
told me where we can get meth.

384
00:30:51,391 --> 00:30:52,725
If it sinks, it's low quality.

385
00:30:53,893 --> 00:30:55,895
If it bubbles, it's high quality.

386
00:30:55,979 --> 00:30:58,523
This one's top-notch quality.

387
00:30:58,606 --> 00:31:01,025
We're the only one
who can provide this quality.

388
00:31:01,860 --> 00:31:03,736
So what does that mean?

389
00:31:03,820 --> 00:31:05,280
Real local food.

390
00:31:05,738 --> 00:31:06,948
Try it.

391
00:31:28,511 --> 00:31:31,306
Mr. Jung has been
stashing away our products

392
00:31:31,389 --> 00:31:34,058
that were supposed to go to Japan

393
00:31:34,142 --> 00:31:36,686
and selling them in Korea.

394
00:31:38,021 --> 00:31:41,983
How can we trade
with someone we can't trust?

395
00:31:44,027 --> 00:31:45,528
I apologize.

396
00:31:45,612 --> 00:31:47,989
I don't know how my boss works.

397
00:31:48,072 --> 00:31:49,073
So?

398
00:31:50,617 --> 00:31:52,452
You have nothing more to say?

399
00:31:54,871 --> 00:31:58,207
Or nothing to suggest?

400
00:32:14,390 --> 00:32:16,517
Wait. How about this?

401
00:32:16,601 --> 00:32:18,227
If you can't trust my boss,

402
00:32:20,355 --> 00:32:21,648
you can trust me.

403
00:32:22,649 --> 00:32:23,733
The carrier to Japan.

404
00:32:24,692 --> 00:32:25,818
Instead of my boss,

405
00:32:28,488 --> 00:32:29,864
let me try it.

406
00:32:30,740 --> 00:32:33,576
So you're betraying Mr. Jung?

407
00:32:33,660 --> 00:32:35,536
No, I'm not betraying him.

408
00:32:35,620 --> 00:32:37,705
I'm going to get his permission,

409
00:32:38,247 --> 00:32:41,167
and I'll officially get involved
in the work.

410
00:32:41,459 --> 00:32:43,211
As long as I get him the money,

411
00:32:43,294 --> 00:32:45,129
there's no reason for him to object.

412
00:32:45,880 --> 00:32:46,881
I see.

413
00:32:48,383 --> 00:32:49,509
But then,

414
00:32:50,802 --> 00:32:53,137
how would replacing him with you

415
00:32:54,472 --> 00:32:56,140
make a difference for me?

416
00:33:02,981 --> 00:33:04,107
The difference is...

417
00:33:07,527 --> 00:33:09,237
If you work with me,

418
00:33:12,907 --> 00:33:15,076
you can spend more time with me.

419
00:33:16,828 --> 00:33:19,038
Seungho.

420
00:33:21,624 --> 00:33:23,084
When it comes to work,

421
00:33:24,252 --> 00:33:26,087
what do you think is more important?

422
00:33:27,171 --> 00:33:28,840
Your heart or money?

423
00:33:41,477 --> 00:33:44,981
That fucker Jung Gicheul
took the products meant for Japan

424
00:33:45,064 --> 00:33:47,275
and was caught selling them
in Korea by the Chinese.

425
00:33:47,734 --> 00:33:51,904
Fuck, the trade with the Chinese
might end up falling through.

426
00:33:54,365 --> 00:33:55,366
Let's do this first.

427
00:33:56,284 --> 00:33:58,870
Let's stop them
from selling the stuff in Korea.

428
00:33:58,953 --> 00:34:00,538
After we take care of that,

429
00:34:00,955 --> 00:34:04,042
I'll see what I can do
to coax the Chinese.

430
00:34:05,585 --> 00:34:09,380
They said you can buy the drugs
at Tae-ho Rock Cafe.

431
00:34:12,759 --> 00:34:15,094
Let's set up Choi Jungbae with this

432
00:34:15,178 --> 00:34:16,512
and get rid of him first.

433
00:34:17,972 --> 00:34:21,809
Let's go.

434
00:34:21,893 --> 00:34:23,394
Hey, how are you?

435
00:34:23,478 --> 00:34:26,522
All right. Let's go.

436
00:34:29,859 --> 00:34:34,238
Shouldn't you dress better when you come
to a place like this? What is this?

437
00:34:35,281 --> 00:34:36,282
Good evening, sir.

438
00:34:36,365 --> 00:34:38,868
All right. Let's go.

439
00:34:38,951 --> 00:34:39,994
Let's go.

440
00:34:46,042 --> 00:34:47,668
NARCOTIC CRIME INVESTIGATION DIVISION

441
00:34:52,507 --> 00:34:55,927
So about Tae-ho Rock Cafe...

442
00:34:56,010 --> 00:34:57,678
Hey, I'm fucking talking to you.

443
00:34:57,804 --> 00:34:58,930
Right.

444
00:34:59,972 --> 00:35:02,266
Rumor has it that
you can buy this new drug...

445
00:35:02,350 --> 00:35:04,727
-Okay.
-...called Gangnam Crystal there.

446
00:35:04,811 --> 00:35:06,437
-And you own the bar.
-Right.

447
00:35:06,521 --> 00:35:07,897
So you must know something.

448
00:35:10,108 --> 00:35:12,318
Can I have a cigarette?

449
00:35:27,250 --> 00:35:28,251
Ah.

450
00:35:32,713 --> 00:35:33,714
So you don't know?

451
00:35:35,424 --> 00:35:37,093
Fucking hell...

452
00:35:37,176 --> 00:35:38,678
What's all this?

453
00:35:40,179 --> 00:35:41,180
There are so many.

454
00:35:41,264 --> 00:35:43,766
You're a very curious man.

455
00:35:43,850 --> 00:35:45,893
-So many fucking Chinese characters.
-Chinese?

456
00:35:45,977 --> 00:35:48,062
Hey, bring him a Chinese dictionary.

457
00:35:48,688 --> 00:35:50,898
Do you need some alone time
to think or what?

458
00:35:51,607 --> 00:35:53,025
Should we wait outside?

459
00:35:53,943 --> 00:35:56,237
Sure, why not? We'll get out.

460
00:35:56,320 --> 00:35:58,406
Let's go work.

461
00:35:59,157 --> 00:36:02,160
Take your time to read the rest and think.

462
00:36:14,714 --> 00:36:18,092
The Chinese keep talking about trust.

463
00:36:18,176 --> 00:36:19,635
They seem to be even thinking

464
00:36:19,719 --> 00:36:22,221
of asking the Japanese
to cancel this whole thing.

465
00:36:25,141 --> 00:36:26,934
Boss.

466
00:36:27,643 --> 00:36:29,520
Instead of sitting here, we should...

467
00:36:30,062 --> 00:36:32,190
Make sure the boys don't talk.

468
00:36:33,733 --> 00:36:36,235
Gicheul, Jungbae got arrested.

469
00:36:36,903 --> 00:36:38,362
-What?
-What do we do?

470
00:36:39,447 --> 00:36:41,824
Fuck, those damn cops.

471
00:36:41,908 --> 00:36:44,202
TAE-HO ROCK CAFE

472
00:36:47,496 --> 00:36:49,248
Hey, move!

473
00:36:49,332 --> 00:36:50,458
Move!

474
00:36:51,083 --> 00:36:52,877
Move.

475
00:36:52,960 --> 00:36:54,378
Move. Get out.

476
00:36:55,129 --> 00:36:57,965
Get down from there. Turn off the music.

477
00:36:58,049 --> 00:36:59,467
I said turn off the music.

478
00:37:01,010 --> 00:37:04,180
-Come on. Get them fucking moving!
-Move them to one side!

479
00:37:05,681 --> 00:37:07,183
-Hurry and move them!
-Get down here!

480
00:37:10,228 --> 00:37:11,812
This is the police.

481
00:37:11,896 --> 00:37:12,897
What are you doing?

482
00:37:18,736 --> 00:37:20,696
It'll be over soon if you cooperate.

483
00:37:20,780 --> 00:37:22,281
Stop that already!

484
00:37:23,074 --> 00:37:25,326
Hey, you rat. Stop right now.

485
00:37:25,409 --> 00:37:26,869
Turn around and stand still.

486
00:37:26,953 --> 00:37:27,954
Get him.

487
00:37:29,288 --> 00:37:30,414
Come here!

488
00:37:30,498 --> 00:37:32,083
-Hold him tight.
-Get off me.

489
00:37:33,292 --> 00:37:35,211
What the fuck are you doing?

490
00:37:36,295 --> 00:37:37,713
Well, what do you think?

491
00:37:37,797 --> 00:37:38,839
Treasure hunting.

492
00:37:42,343 --> 00:37:43,511
There it is.

493
00:37:45,054 --> 00:37:46,055
Fuck.

494
00:37:52,103 --> 00:37:53,104
God damn.

495
00:38:06,784 --> 00:38:07,785
Detective Choi.

496
00:38:13,332 --> 00:38:17,253
Man, I envy the life of a celebrity.

497
00:38:17,962 --> 00:38:19,005
Goodness...

498
00:38:26,804 --> 00:38:28,139
Excuse me, sir.

499
00:38:28,222 --> 00:38:29,223
Wake up.

500
00:38:29,765 --> 00:38:31,183
What...

501
00:38:31,267 --> 00:38:32,768
Wake up.

502
00:38:36,814 --> 00:38:39,191
What the...

503
00:38:40,318 --> 00:38:41,444
We're from the police.

504
00:38:41,527 --> 00:38:43,279
Move it!

505
00:38:43,362 --> 00:38:44,947
- How dare you...
- Fuck!

506
00:38:45,031 --> 00:38:46,657
-What?
-Get your hands off me.

507
00:38:46,741 --> 00:38:48,117
I said move, you bastard.

508
00:38:48,909 --> 00:38:50,202
God damn it!

509
00:38:56,208 --> 00:38:58,252
-Hey, come on.
-Son of a bitch...

510
00:38:59,462 --> 00:39:01,213
Don't mind us.

511
00:39:01,297 --> 00:39:02,381
Keep thinking.

512
00:39:06,469 --> 00:39:08,971
-What?
-Get a sample of your urine.

513
00:39:11,390 --> 00:39:13,768
Tell me. Who told you about me?

514
00:39:13,851 --> 00:39:17,104
Who's the bastard
talking about me?

515
00:39:17,438 --> 00:39:19,190
In the other room over there

516
00:39:19,273 --> 00:39:22,526
is the owner of Tae-ho Rock Cafe,
Choi Jungbae.

517
00:39:23,152 --> 00:39:24,153
You know him.

518
00:39:24,570 --> 00:39:27,073
He went to Yeoksam High too, right?

519
00:39:29,408 --> 00:39:30,409
Goodness.

520
00:39:32,495 --> 00:39:33,788
Sir, we're closed.

521
00:39:35,331 --> 00:39:38,125
If you're not going to talk,
go home and sleep.

522
00:39:42,421 --> 00:39:43,923
What?

523
00:39:44,006 --> 00:39:46,217
You're not a suspect. You're a witness.

524
00:39:46,300 --> 00:39:48,177
So if you have nothing to say, just go.

525
00:39:51,889 --> 00:39:53,641
-Give me a cigarette.
-We don't have any.

526
00:39:53,724 --> 00:39:55,684
Go buy some. You have a lot of money.

527
00:40:11,075 --> 00:40:12,576
What did you tell the cops?

528
00:40:13,244 --> 00:40:16,914
Well, what could I have said?

529
00:40:18,874 --> 00:40:20,376
They mentioned it first.

530
00:40:21,293 --> 00:40:23,921
Rumors say you could buy meth
from Tae-ho Rock Cafe,

531
00:40:24,004 --> 00:40:25,589
and they asked if I knew anything.

532
00:40:26,048 --> 00:40:27,049
And?

533
00:40:31,846 --> 00:40:33,264
I didn't say anything.

534
00:40:38,978 --> 00:40:40,771
They ransacked the club after that.

535
00:40:44,316 --> 00:40:45,526
Wow.

536
00:40:48,195 --> 00:40:49,196
So are you saying...

537
00:40:51,031 --> 00:40:52,700
this happened because of me?

538
00:40:58,414 --> 00:41:00,166
Move. I need to talk to them.

539
00:41:00,958 --> 00:41:02,126
What the fuck is going on?

540
00:41:02,376 --> 00:41:04,837
Gicheul!

541
00:41:04,920 --> 00:41:07,673
-Choi Jungbae, you fucking bastard.
-What?

542
00:41:07,756 --> 00:41:09,592
How dare you rat on me?

543
00:41:09,675 --> 00:41:11,260
You motherfucker.

544
00:41:11,343 --> 00:41:14,722
How dare you try to fuck up the life
of a fellow graduate, you asshole?

545
00:41:14,805 --> 00:41:17,558
What the fuck are you talking about?
I didn't rat, you fuck!

546
00:41:17,641 --> 00:41:20,269
You told the cops I did drugs,
you motherfucker!

547
00:41:20,352 --> 00:41:22,646
Have you lost your fucking mind,
you meth head?

548
00:41:23,105 --> 00:41:24,940
I didn't fucking rat anybody out!

549
00:41:25,024 --> 00:41:26,734
Yeah. I have lost my mind, you fuck.

550
00:41:26,817 --> 00:41:28,319
If it weren't for my lawyer,

551
00:41:28,402 --> 00:41:31,071
I would've been fucked today, you asshole!

552
00:41:32,406 --> 00:41:33,657
Hey, Gicheul.

553
00:41:33,741 --> 00:41:35,993
Do something about this bastard!

554
00:41:38,829 --> 00:41:40,748
Everyone except Jungbae get out.

555
00:41:42,666 --> 00:41:43,792
Get out!

556
00:41:55,721 --> 00:41:57,473
Now we're alone,

557
00:41:58,974 --> 00:42:00,309
so tell me the truth.

558
00:42:05,272 --> 00:42:09,818
So it wasn't weird
when Kwon Seungho was freed

559
00:42:09,902 --> 00:42:12,363
and it's weird when I'm freed?

560
00:42:18,410 --> 00:42:20,371
I didn't say anything.

561
00:42:21,247 --> 00:42:23,582
Then, why did they just let you go?

562
00:42:24,291 --> 00:42:26,794
Seriously, Gicheul. Stop this.

563
00:42:28,045 --> 00:42:30,839
You know I've never lied to you.

564
00:42:31,298 --> 00:42:32,466
Are you sure?

565
00:42:32,550 --> 00:42:33,926
Gicheul.

566
00:42:42,560 --> 00:42:44,436
It's the second set of books
from your bar.

567
00:42:47,648 --> 00:42:48,857
Explain it.

568
00:42:52,403 --> 00:42:53,779
-Jungbae.
-Yes?

569
00:42:55,239 --> 00:42:57,199
Have you been stashing money
behind my back?

570
00:42:58,742 --> 00:43:00,578
Did you run a background check on me?

571
00:43:00,661 --> 00:43:01,745
Did you think...

572
00:43:03,706 --> 00:43:06,959
I wouldn't know you were selling
my stuff behind my back?

573
00:43:07,042 --> 00:43:08,127
Your stuff?

574
00:43:08,210 --> 00:43:09,211
It's our stuff.

575
00:43:09,545 --> 00:43:10,629
What the hell did you say?

576
00:43:10,713 --> 00:43:14,091
Junkies turn their backs on you
when you run out of drugs.

577
00:43:14,174 --> 00:43:17,011
So I made sure we had some
in stock just in case.

578
00:43:19,597 --> 00:43:21,181
You should've told me about it.

579
00:43:21,265 --> 00:43:23,767
As if you would've let me if I told you.

580
00:43:24,268 --> 00:43:25,978
Are you sure that's why?

581
00:43:28,022 --> 00:43:30,941
Then, bring me the stuff you put aside.

582
00:43:33,944 --> 00:43:35,446
Bring it to me.

583
00:43:38,824 --> 00:43:42,161
Did you think I wouldn't know
you've already cashed it in?

584
00:43:42,244 --> 00:43:43,495
Did you?

585
00:43:53,464 --> 00:43:58,302
Gather all your money and go somewhere
far away into the country.

586
00:43:59,470 --> 00:44:01,347
And stay out of sight from the cops.

587
00:44:22,785 --> 00:44:23,869
Why?

588
00:44:25,245 --> 00:44:31,710
Is it so wrong that I wanted
to make some money too?

589
00:44:33,087 --> 00:44:34,963
I'm an ambitious man too, you know.

590
00:44:36,548 --> 00:44:39,343
Why can't I go big time like you?

591
00:44:44,890 --> 00:44:46,642
You can do whatever you like,

592
00:44:47,976 --> 00:44:49,853
but you can't lie to me.

593
00:44:51,772 --> 00:44:53,023
I see.

594
00:45:11,709 --> 00:45:13,544
Seriously, after 20 years?

595
00:45:22,886 --> 00:45:26,181
You're going to kick me out
over something like this? Eh?

596
00:45:27,766 --> 00:45:30,227
I'm the one you need
by your side right now.

597
00:45:32,604 --> 00:45:33,605
Gicheul.

598
00:45:35,190 --> 00:45:39,528
Your judgement is totally off right now.
And I blame that fucking cop, Yu Euijeong.

599
00:45:39,611 --> 00:45:40,612
Am I wrong?

600
00:45:41,613 --> 00:45:42,990
Shut your mouth.

601
00:45:44,950 --> 00:45:46,577
Or I'll kill you.

602
00:45:47,995 --> 00:45:51,790
I'm not the one hanging around
with cops. It's you!

603
00:45:52,624 --> 00:45:55,961
And you keep bringing along Kwon Seungho
because he's close with her!

604
00:46:00,841 --> 00:46:02,926
Weird things keep happening to our gang,

605
00:46:03,010 --> 00:46:04,678
and yet, you never suspected him!

606
00:46:06,805 --> 00:46:10,142
I'm not the one you should kick out!

607
00:46:10,225 --> 00:46:12,019
It's Yu Euijeong and Kwon Seungho!

608
00:46:30,078 --> 00:46:32,414
One day, you'll realize you were blinded.

609
00:46:33,874 --> 00:46:34,917
I guarantee it.

610
00:47:02,528 --> 00:47:04,571
Hey, you. Look at my eyes.

611
00:47:07,491 --> 00:47:09,785
You have a lot in your mind, don't you?

612
00:47:11,161 --> 00:47:13,664
Get home safely, sir.

613
00:47:20,921 --> 00:47:22,506
You look great in that suit.

614
00:47:27,928 --> 00:47:29,596
Go inside and take care of Boss.

615
00:47:30,472 --> 00:47:31,515
Where are you going, sir?

616
00:47:33,809 --> 00:47:37,062
You said we should push our way in
or push someone out.

617
00:47:37,855 --> 00:47:38,939
Okay, sir.

618
00:48:16,977 --> 00:48:17,978
Who is it?

619
00:48:19,229 --> 00:48:20,397
It's me, Kwon Seungho.

620
00:48:21,481 --> 00:48:22,482
Come in.

621
00:48:39,124 --> 00:48:40,167
Boss.

622
00:48:44,379 --> 00:48:46,048
You must be upset

623
00:48:47,841 --> 00:48:49,301
because of Jungbae.

624
00:48:51,303 --> 00:48:54,431
I understand how you're feeling,
but shouldn't we continue...

625
00:48:56,642 --> 00:48:58,143
the trade that we were doing?

626
00:49:07,361 --> 00:49:08,528
I should stay strong.

627
00:49:10,697 --> 00:49:13,533
Yes, sir.

628
00:49:17,454 --> 00:49:18,497
Answer it.

629
00:49:20,082 --> 00:49:21,500
Hello. Kwon Seungho speaking.

630
00:49:21,583 --> 00:49:23,251
<i>Hi, this is Haeryun.</i>

631
00:49:25,921 --> 00:49:26,964
Hi, Haeryun.

632
00:49:27,089 --> 00:49:29,007
You're with Mr. Jung now, right?

633
00:49:29,424 --> 00:49:30,425
Yes.

634
00:49:34,930 --> 00:49:36,974
I was about to call you actually.

635
00:49:37,265 --> 00:49:38,600
<i>I was hoping we could meet</i>

636
00:49:38,684 --> 00:49:41,520
<i>to clear the air</i>
<i>and talk about out future plans.</i>

637
00:49:42,104 --> 00:49:44,439
How can we have a future

638
00:49:45,357 --> 00:49:47,484
when the present seems uncertain?

639
00:49:48,026 --> 00:49:51,446
This whole thing is on us. I apologize.

640
00:49:51,530 --> 00:49:55,283
<i>Don't you usually have</i>
<i>other people apologize for you?</i>

641
00:49:55,701 --> 00:49:57,244
When I have time later,

642
00:49:58,370 --> 00:50:00,831
I'll take the apology
from Seungho personally.

643
00:50:01,248 --> 00:50:02,749
<i>Would that be okay?</i>

644
00:50:04,501 --> 00:50:05,794
Anytime would be fine.

645
00:50:06,753 --> 00:50:08,755
Wouldn't it be better that way, Seungho?

646
00:50:11,508 --> 00:50:14,636
Sure. If you let me know when,
I'll make sure to visit you.

647
00:50:16,138 --> 00:50:17,681
I'll call you soon.

648
00:50:20,017 --> 00:50:21,393
Let's go on a date.

649
00:50:25,439 --> 00:50:27,315
I wonder what she's up to.

650
00:50:27,399 --> 00:50:30,360
Whatever it is, this is good for us.

651
00:50:30,444 --> 00:50:33,321
Lee Haeryun is giving us a chance.

652
00:50:34,990 --> 00:50:36,033
Boss.

653
00:50:36,908 --> 00:50:38,577
I'll do whatever it takes

654
00:50:39,202 --> 00:50:43,290
to change her mind.

655
00:50:43,915 --> 00:50:45,459
I promise

656
00:50:47,878 --> 00:50:49,463
I won't let you down, Boss.

657
00:50:53,759 --> 00:50:54,843
Okay.

658
00:50:57,637 --> 00:50:59,765
I don't want to be
let down anymore either.

659
00:51:39,346 --> 00:51:41,264
You look happy.

660
00:51:43,016 --> 00:51:44,976
Can you at least let me leave in peace?

661
00:51:45,268 --> 00:51:46,436
Hey, fatty.

662
00:51:47,479 --> 00:51:50,232
You always want to
fucking take the easy road.

663
00:51:50,315 --> 00:51:52,484
That's why you got so fat.

664
00:51:53,777 --> 00:51:55,153
Take the stairs down.

665
00:51:57,322 --> 00:51:59,616
Oh, no. The elevator broke down.

666
00:52:12,838 --> 00:52:14,673
God, this fucking piece of shit!

667
00:52:26,643 --> 00:52:28,019
You fucking asshole.

668
00:52:28,103 --> 00:52:29,229
You son of a bitch!

669
00:53:00,719 --> 00:53:02,762
Chief Seo, wait!

670
00:53:25,952 --> 00:53:27,829
Fuck.

671
00:53:29,915 --> 00:53:31,583
You need a good beating,

672
00:53:32,918 --> 00:53:36,880
so you won't even think about
coming back here, you motherfucker.

673
00:53:51,770 --> 00:53:52,896
Hey.

674
00:53:54,522 --> 00:53:57,317
Don't you ever step foot
in this neighborhood again.

675
00:54:28,139 --> 00:54:34,145
You fucking asshole!

676
00:54:53,540 --> 00:54:54,541
Hey.

677
00:54:54,624 --> 00:54:56,126
What's going on at the church?

678
00:54:57,252 --> 00:55:00,463
How about you go in alone? I'll wait here.

679
00:55:01,715 --> 00:55:05,552
Well, we don't want people
to see us together, right?

680
00:55:07,262 --> 00:55:08,596
What's going on?

681
00:55:09,639 --> 00:55:12,392
I thought it was Wonder Woman
holding that knife.

682
00:55:14,394 --> 00:55:17,397
I heard she was known
for being such an awesome person.

683
00:55:18,273 --> 00:55:20,650
When someone suggested we start a petition

684
00:55:20,734 --> 00:55:23,486
to oppose the construction
of a center for the disabled,

685
00:55:23,570 --> 00:55:25,572
Theresa came down hard on them.

686
00:55:25,655 --> 00:55:27,240
Yes, that's right.

687
00:55:27,657 --> 00:55:31,411
And whenever she saw children,
she wanted to buy them pencils.

688
00:55:31,494 --> 00:55:32,912
That's how sweet she was.

689
00:55:34,080 --> 00:55:36,583
The Theresa Hwang Jinsook I knew

690
00:55:36,666 --> 00:55:39,336
shined like a gem,

691
00:55:39,419 --> 00:55:43,548
but she always stepped back
to let others shine.

692
00:55:43,631 --> 00:55:46,384
And where does
this sweet Theresa reside now?

693
00:55:47,969 --> 00:55:50,430
In your memories.

694
00:55:50,513 --> 00:55:52,265
Her daughter is right here now,

695
00:55:53,391 --> 00:55:56,978
so after this, please take a moment
to share a few words with her.

696
00:55:57,062 --> 00:55:59,606
Tell her your memories of Theresa.

697
00:56:00,899 --> 00:56:05,362
And in this way,
Theresa will live on forever.

698
00:56:08,365 --> 00:56:10,658
We humbly beseech you to shower your mercy

699
00:56:10,742 --> 00:56:13,828
upon those who mourn and grieve
for their departed loved ones.

700
00:56:13,912 --> 00:56:16,998
Envelop them in your love and compassion,

701
00:56:17,082 --> 00:56:19,584
and wash away their tears.

702
00:56:20,377 --> 00:56:23,797
As believers
in your life and resurrection,

703
00:56:23,880 --> 00:56:26,299
we affirm that death is not the end,

704
00:56:26,383 --> 00:56:30,011
but the beginning of a new
and everlasting existence.

705
00:56:33,264 --> 00:56:35,600
You didn't have to prepare this.

706
00:56:35,683 --> 00:56:37,560
Of course, we had to.

707
00:56:37,644 --> 00:56:41,356
We've attended church together
for over 20 years.

708
00:56:42,565 --> 00:56:44,484
How's your older brother doing?

709
00:56:44,859 --> 00:56:48,071
He and my son, Changdae,
used to say they were going to the library

710
00:56:48,154 --> 00:56:49,572
and always slacked off together.

711
00:56:50,073 --> 00:56:52,826
He's doing well.

712
00:56:52,909 --> 00:56:55,870
You look exactly the same
as when you were in elementary school.

713
00:56:56,788 --> 00:57:00,208
I felt bad I couldn't attend her funeral.

714
00:57:00,291 --> 00:57:02,627
But then, Gicheul asked us

715
00:57:02,710 --> 00:57:04,462
to organize this.

716
00:57:10,593 --> 00:57:12,011
Thank you, ma'am.

717
00:57:14,848 --> 00:57:17,809
<i>You look exactly the same</i>

Hello, this is Jung Gicheul.

724
00:57:41,666 --> 00:57:43,042
<i>Hello, Mr. Jung.</i>

725
00:57:43,126 --> 00:57:44,919
What did Jungbae ask you to do?

726
00:57:45,295 --> 00:57:47,297
To check if Yu Euijeong lived in Wonju,

727
00:57:47,630 --> 00:57:49,883
if Kwon Seungho went to the same school,

728
00:57:51,050 --> 00:57:52,385
and if he lived next door.

729
00:57:52,927 --> 00:57:54,387
I want you to check those now.

730
00:57:54,512 --> 00:57:55,513
<i>Now?</i>

731
00:57:55,597 --> 00:58:00,101
It seems she never moved to Wonju
and has always lived in Seoul.

732
00:58:00,185 --> 00:58:01,895
<i>Yes, Mr. Jung.</i>

733
00:58:18,620 --> 00:58:19,787
Thank you.

734
00:58:40,475 --> 00:58:41,476
Euijeong.

735
00:58:42,727 --> 00:58:44,229
Let's stay one more hour.

736
00:58:45,647 --> 00:58:46,814
To do what?

737
00:58:47,565 --> 00:58:48,942
I just want to quietly...

738
00:58:50,652 --> 00:58:52,654
look at your face for an hour.

739
00:58:56,491 --> 00:58:57,784
Captain Seok just called me

740
00:58:58,451 --> 00:59:00,328
and said they're in a coffee shop now.

741
00:59:01,955 --> 00:59:03,414
Where were they before that?

742
00:59:03,498 --> 00:59:06,125
He said they went to a church,
but I'm not sure.

743
00:59:15,969 --> 00:59:17,929
- Hello?
<i>- Hello, sir. It's me.</i>

744
00:59:18,012 --> 00:59:19,180
Hi, Mr. Lee.

745
00:59:19,264 --> 00:59:21,015
That private detective Cheon came by.

746
00:59:22,308 --> 00:59:24,102
<i>He asked me to check</i>

747
00:59:24,185 --> 00:59:27,021
<i>if former Commissioner Yu Dukhoon</i>
<i>had ever worked in Gangwon.</i>

748
00:59:27,855 --> 00:59:29,816
<i>I said I couldn't do that,</i>

749
00:59:29,899 --> 00:59:33,027
<i>so he said he'd reach out</i>
<i>to the Retired Police Association.</i>

750
00:59:33,403 --> 00:59:35,905
Is Jung Gicheul taking Euijeong hostage...

751
00:59:51,212 --> 00:59:55,425
I'm writing a memoir
on former Commissioner Yu Dukhoon.

752
00:59:55,508 --> 00:59:57,385
And I need a lot of information.

753
00:59:57,468 --> 00:59:59,846
RETIRED POLICE ASSOCIATION

754
00:59:59,929 --> 01:00:01,514
My shift's over soon.

755
01:00:02,307 --> 01:00:03,850
Do you need it right now?

756
01:00:03,933 --> 01:00:07,061
I know. You have to go home, right?

757
01:00:08,187 --> 01:00:09,981
By the way, it looks like...

758
01:00:12,025 --> 01:00:13,860
he has never been...

759
01:00:14,986 --> 01:00:16,946
to Gangwon Province in his life.

760
01:00:22,619 --> 01:00:24,203
This is a big scoop.

761
01:00:48,227 --> 01:00:50,104
Hello.

762
01:00:50,188 --> 01:00:53,900
Are you Cheon Jinpyung by any chance?

763
01:00:53,983 --> 01:00:54,984
I am.

764
01:00:55,068 --> 01:00:56,110
You know me, right?

765
01:00:57,445 --> 01:00:59,530
Mr. Jung sent me.

766
01:01:03,910 --> 01:01:07,455
Can we talk for a moment?

767
01:01:07,538 --> 01:01:08,539
Sure.

768
01:01:18,007 --> 01:01:20,510
We could've talked inside
since it's raining.

769
01:01:22,011 --> 01:01:25,431
By the way, what are those documents?

770
01:01:26,015 --> 01:01:28,685
These? Why do you ask?

771
01:01:28,768 --> 01:01:30,937
Well, my boss gave me an errand to run.

772
01:01:31,938 --> 01:01:34,774
I think I should ask your boss first.

773
01:01:37,443 --> 01:01:38,695
No, wait.

774
01:01:39,278 --> 01:01:40,405
What are you doing?

775
01:01:40,488 --> 01:01:43,241
I think I should see
those documents first.

776
01:01:45,576 --> 01:01:48,413
I said these were nothing.

777
01:01:48,496 --> 01:01:49,497
Damn it!

778
01:01:58,005 --> 01:01:59,006
God damn it!

779
01:01:59,090 --> 01:02:01,759
What the fuck are you doing?
Give me the documents.

780
01:02:02,176 --> 01:02:05,596
Hey, who are you actually?

781
01:02:05,680 --> 01:02:07,473
I said it's my boss's order!

782
01:02:07,557 --> 01:02:09,225
Give me the documents now!

783
01:02:09,308 --> 01:02:10,768
Like fucking hell it's your boss.

784
01:02:11,477 --> 01:02:13,396
That's bullshit. Look.

785
01:02:13,479 --> 01:02:16,774
Why is a cop pretending
to be a gangster's lackey?

786
01:02:19,193 --> 01:02:20,862
Senior Police Officer Park Junmo.

787
01:02:20,945 --> 01:02:22,196
Yu Dukhoon's son-in-law.

788
01:02:22,530 --> 01:02:25,783
What in the world are you guys cooking up?

789
01:02:38,045 --> 01:02:40,923
Hey, Cheon Jinpyung.
Stop being a lackey for thugs,

790
01:02:41,007 --> 01:02:43,217
or you'll end up rotting in jail.

791
01:02:43,301 --> 01:02:46,929
Look, I'll have your back,

792
01:02:47,013 --> 01:02:48,431
so cooperate with the police.

793
01:02:49,223 --> 01:02:51,058
"Cooperate"?

794
01:02:51,142 --> 01:02:53,770
Sure, I'll fucking cooperate.
Here it fucking is.

795
01:02:56,397 --> 01:02:57,440
That motherfucker.

796
01:03:16,751 --> 01:03:18,628
You son of a bitch!

797
01:03:21,380 --> 01:03:22,423
Fuck.

798
01:03:47,114 --> 01:03:48,157
Fuck!

799
01:04:43,462 --> 01:04:44,463
Help me.

800
01:04:46,465 --> 01:04:47,633
Get the fuck off me.

801
01:04:55,141 --> 01:04:58,352
SENIOR POLICE OFFICER PARK JUNMO

802
01:05:06,527 --> 01:05:07,987
Gicheul.

803
01:05:08,070 --> 01:05:09,488
I need to go now.

804
01:05:13,826 --> 01:05:16,787
I'll see you again. Thanks for today.

805
01:05:48,778 --> 01:05:50,696
<i>The number you have dialed...</i>
