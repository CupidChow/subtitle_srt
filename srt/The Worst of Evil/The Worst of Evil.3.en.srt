1
00:00:01,710 --> 00:00:08,717
THE CHARACTERS, PLACES, ORGANIZATIONS AND
EVENTS IN THIS DRAMA ARE WORKS OF FICTION

2
00:00:57,348 --> 00:00:58,933
THE SHOWER

3
00:00:59,184 --> 00:01:00,185
What's this?

4
00:01:00,477 --> 00:01:01,978
Are you free this weekend?

5
00:01:02,062 --> 00:01:03,563
Let's go watch a movie.

6
00:01:05,231 --> 00:01:06,691
Oh, I have something for you.

7
00:01:07,108 --> 00:01:08,485
What is it?

8
00:01:09,360 --> 00:01:10,612
What's this?

9
00:01:13,948 --> 00:01:15,658
I got it because it was pretty.

10
00:01:15,742 --> 00:01:16,743
It is pretty.

11
00:01:19,370 --> 00:01:22,248
Euijeong and Gicheul.
Look here.

12
00:01:23,083 --> 00:01:24,501
No, we're good.

13
00:01:24,751 --> 00:01:26,169
Come on. Let's take one.

14
00:01:26,586 --> 00:01:28,463
One, two, three.

15
00:01:29,339 --> 00:01:31,966
Could you take one more?

16
00:01:32,050 --> 00:01:33,510
So we can each have one.

17
00:01:33,593 --> 00:01:37,055
Wow, Gicheul.
You're not even trying to hide it.

18
00:01:38,556 --> 00:01:39,557
One, two...

19
00:01:39,641 --> 00:01:40,725
Wait. Hold on.

20
00:01:42,685 --> 00:01:43,770
Let me do it for you.

21
00:01:46,064 --> 00:01:47,565
-There.
-Thanks.

22
00:01:49,192 --> 00:01:51,444
One, two, three.

23
00:01:54,405 --> 00:01:55,490
One more?

24
00:01:56,866 --> 00:01:57,867
Scoot closer.

25
00:02:01,913 --> 00:02:02,914
Get ready.

26
00:02:05,416 --> 00:02:07,752
THE WORST OF EVIL

27
00:02:07,836 --> 00:02:09,629
One, two, three.

28
00:02:17,512 --> 00:02:20,014
I haven't seen Junmo lately.

29
00:02:21,349 --> 00:02:23,351
He's been very busy.

30
00:02:23,434 --> 00:02:25,311
Why? Do you miss him?

31
00:02:25,562 --> 00:02:27,605
Of course, I do.

32
00:02:27,689 --> 00:02:30,066
He's the only son-in-law I have.

33
00:02:30,650 --> 00:02:32,318
I'll tell him to drop by.

34
00:02:33,820 --> 00:02:36,531
Tell him to make an appearance on TV shows

35
00:02:36,614 --> 00:02:38,366
like other detectives do.

36
00:02:38,867 --> 00:02:41,744
I want to brag about my son-in-law
like the other ladies here.

37
00:02:45,290 --> 00:02:48,168
Mom, do you remember the kid

38
00:02:48,251 --> 00:02:51,379
named Jung Gicheul from my church choir?

39
00:02:52,380 --> 00:02:54,257
Of course, I do.

40
00:02:54,340 --> 00:02:56,092
I heard he's a gangster now.

41
00:02:57,010 --> 00:02:58,553
You knew that too?

42
00:02:59,137 --> 00:03:01,222
If you live in the same area
for 20 years,

43
00:03:01,306 --> 00:03:03,057
you hear all kinds of things.

44
00:03:05,518 --> 00:03:07,812
I can't believe he ended up like that.

45
00:03:26,539 --> 00:03:29,334
Stop taking photos!
There are children here.

46
00:03:29,584 --> 00:03:31,920
This is too cruel.

47
00:03:32,003 --> 00:03:33,421
My goodness!

48
00:03:33,504 --> 00:03:34,505
Those reporters!

49
00:03:35,798 --> 00:03:37,884
Is Gicheul a senior?

50
00:03:37,967 --> 00:03:39,219
No, a junior.

51
00:04:31,437 --> 00:04:33,481
RESUME
KWON SEUNGHO

52
00:04:33,940 --> 00:04:35,650
"Kwon Seungho."

53
00:04:36,276 --> 00:04:38,486
FACT CHECK
CHECK HIS FATHER'S CRIMINAL RECORD

54
00:04:42,824 --> 00:04:44,409
SMPA YU EUIJEONG
SECURITY DIV?

55
00:04:44,492 --> 00:04:46,911
MARRIED TO A COP?
HIS NAME, PHOTO, DEPARTMENT

56
00:04:50,832 --> 00:04:51,916
"Yu Euijeong."

57
00:04:53,626 --> 00:04:54,794
Husband's photo?

58
00:05:03,094 --> 00:05:05,763
I said we met
because of my father's arrest,

59
00:05:05,847 --> 00:05:07,515
and they didn't ask any further.

60
00:05:07,598 --> 00:05:09,225
But I can't be sure

61
00:05:09,309 --> 00:05:11,019
if they believe me or not.

62
00:05:14,814 --> 00:05:16,190
By the way,

63
00:05:19,152 --> 00:05:23,698
were you and Jung Gicheul really close?

64
00:05:23,781 --> 00:05:25,783
Just for a while in high school.

65
00:05:25,867 --> 00:05:27,577
I've never met him since.

66
00:05:28,244 --> 00:05:30,163
<i>-Why?</i>
-It's nothing.

67
00:05:30,246 --> 00:05:32,248
I'll call you later.

68
00:05:32,749 --> 00:05:34,042
Don't worry.

69
00:05:35,251 --> 00:05:36,419
Okay.

70
00:05:42,550 --> 00:05:45,011
I'm sorry we didn't tell you
about Detective Park.

71
00:05:45,094 --> 00:05:46,804
It was for security reasons.

72
00:05:47,055 --> 00:05:50,099
Dohyung, I'm really disappointed.

73
00:05:50,308 --> 00:05:52,060
How could you, of all people,

74
00:05:52,143 --> 00:05:54,854
put Junmo into such a dangerous operation?

75
00:05:54,937 --> 00:05:56,731
I just don't understand.

76
00:05:56,814 --> 00:05:58,649
I'm sorry, Euijeong.

77
00:05:58,733 --> 00:06:00,068
I'm really sorry,

78
00:06:00,151 --> 00:06:02,570
but this is something only Junmo can do.

79
00:06:02,653 --> 00:06:03,696
Dohyung.

80
00:06:10,286 --> 00:06:11,746
JUNG GICHEUL

81
00:06:11,829 --> 00:06:14,957
Jung Gicheul found out
Junmo and I know each other,

82
00:06:15,041 --> 00:06:17,210
and he also knows I'm a cop.

83
00:06:17,293 --> 00:06:20,338
Are you really going to
keep Junmo in there?

84
00:06:20,421 --> 00:06:25,259
For the time being, we should wait
for Jung Gicheul's next move.

85
00:06:25,927 --> 00:06:27,762
I'll keep an eye on him,

86
00:06:27,845 --> 00:06:29,555
-so don't worry too much.
-Dohyung.

87
00:06:29,639 --> 00:06:32,683
You know Junmo way better than I do.

88
00:06:32,767 --> 00:06:35,144
Once he starts something, he never quits.

89
00:06:35,228 --> 00:06:36,312
Inspector Yu.

90
00:06:37,313 --> 00:06:40,149
You want Detective Park
to close the case quickly

91
00:06:40,233 --> 00:06:41,567
and come back home, right?

92
00:06:42,860 --> 00:06:46,030
Then, to do that,
we'd like your active support.

93
00:06:46,114 --> 00:06:47,490
Sir, please.

94
00:06:49,450 --> 00:06:50,952
I'd very much appreciate it.

95
00:07:06,426 --> 00:07:10,138
Did you really have to make me come
to the office at the crack of the dawn?

96
00:07:11,556 --> 00:07:14,392
Here. Share these with your officers.

97
00:07:14,475 --> 00:07:15,768
They're American donuts.

98
00:07:16,686 --> 00:07:17,687
Take it.

99
00:07:27,989 --> 00:07:29,323
Thanks for the donuts.

100
00:07:29,407 --> 00:07:30,616
Sure. Hope you enjoy.

101
00:07:34,537 --> 00:07:35,872
Good morning, sir.

102
00:07:35,955 --> 00:07:36,956
Hey.

103
00:08:00,813 --> 00:08:02,648
Kwon Seungho's father, Kwon Jangseok,

104
00:08:02,732 --> 00:08:06,027
was convicted four times
for violating the Narcotics Control Act.

105
00:08:06,235 --> 00:08:07,862
As for the schools he attended,

106
00:08:07,945 --> 00:08:09,280
I'll go to Wonju and check.

107
00:08:10,990 --> 00:08:14,076
Yu Euijeong's father is
the former commissioner of SMPA,

108
00:08:14,160 --> 00:08:16,287
Yu Dukhoon, and he retired last year.

109
00:08:17,288 --> 00:08:20,875
Her mother is getting cancer treatments
at Yeongdong Severance Hospital.

110
00:08:23,377 --> 00:08:24,712
She's in the Security Division

111
00:08:24,795 --> 00:08:27,924
and her husband is a detective
at Eumseong Police Station.

112
00:08:28,007 --> 00:08:29,300
Here's a photo of him.

113
00:08:49,070 --> 00:08:50,154
Kwon Seungho.

114
00:09:09,549 --> 00:09:10,925
When you met Euijeong,

115
00:09:12,301 --> 00:09:13,886
did she talk about her husband?

116
00:09:14,470 --> 00:09:15,513
No.

117
00:09:24,397 --> 00:09:26,941
"Eumseong Police Station,
Criminal Affairs Division.

118
00:09:27,692 --> 00:09:29,360
Senior Police Officer Park Junmo."

119
00:09:48,170 --> 00:09:51,048
EUMSEONG POLICE STATION
DETECTIVE PARK JUNMO

120
00:09:52,216 --> 00:09:53,759
Have you seen him before?

121
00:09:56,012 --> 00:09:57,013
No.

122
00:09:57,138 --> 00:09:58,514
Look closely.

123
00:09:59,515 --> 00:10:01,017
Have you seen him?

124
00:10:03,352 --> 00:10:05,563
No, I haven't.

125
00:10:06,564 --> 00:10:07,940
Hey.

126
00:10:10,151 --> 00:10:11,777
Who's more handsome? Me or him?

127
00:10:14,113 --> 00:10:15,114
You, Boss.

128
00:10:19,285 --> 00:10:20,286
Let's go wash up.

129
00:10:21,120 --> 00:10:22,121
Yes, Boss.

130
00:10:25,708 --> 00:10:26,709
Right.

131
00:10:29,879 --> 00:10:31,839
Is Euijeong originally from Wonju?

132
00:10:34,884 --> 00:10:40,306
As far as I know, she moved to Wonju
because of her father's work.

133
00:10:40,389 --> 00:10:43,768
Then, she moved back to Seoul
in middle school.

134
00:10:51,067 --> 00:10:55,988
Didn't you know the police intranet
saves your search history

135
00:10:56,072 --> 00:10:58,199
while you're logged in?

136
00:10:59,325 --> 00:11:00,826
I knew.

137
00:11:00,910 --> 00:11:02,828
Then, how could you be so reckless

138
00:11:03,120 --> 00:11:04,705
and sell info to a private eye?

139
00:11:04,789 --> 00:11:06,040
I'm sorry, sir.

140
00:11:06,332 --> 00:11:08,501
I know your kids aren't married yet.

141
00:11:09,543 --> 00:11:12,463
-Do you want to make the headlines?
-No, sir.

142
00:11:15,716 --> 00:11:18,928
Starting from today,
you're going to do as I say.

143
00:11:19,011 --> 00:11:23,015
If you do everything
I tell you to do, I'll let it slide.

144
00:11:23,849 --> 00:11:25,768
But if you mess up even just a little,

145
00:11:25,851 --> 00:11:27,645
you'll go straight to jail.

146
00:11:27,812 --> 00:11:29,271
Yes, sir.

147
00:11:29,605 --> 00:11:31,399
You can go now.

148
00:11:31,482 --> 00:11:33,150
And always answer when I call.

149
00:11:42,410 --> 00:11:44,787
And he calls himself a chief.

150
00:11:45,538 --> 00:11:49,625
If you hadn't prepared in advance,
we would've been in trouble.

151
00:11:49,750 --> 00:11:50,751
Right.

152
00:11:53,212 --> 00:11:56,132
Seeing how he duped
the Busan thugs at the rock club

153
00:11:56,215 --> 00:11:59,260
and ran background checks
right after meeting Inspector Yu,

154
00:11:59,468 --> 00:12:03,764
Jung Gicheul seems to be smarter
and more meticulous than I thought.

155
00:12:05,099 --> 00:12:07,685
Let's find out who's smarter.

156
00:12:08,352 --> 00:12:09,520
How?

157
00:12:12,732 --> 00:12:14,442
Let's crank it all the way up.

158
00:12:14,900 --> 00:12:16,569
Yeah, so how?

159
00:12:22,575 --> 00:12:25,953
By the way, where do you go
during the day instead of sleeping?

160
00:12:26,370 --> 00:12:29,457
I just ride the subway
and sleep in the seats.

161
00:12:29,999 --> 00:12:31,584
It helps me fall asleep more.

162
00:12:31,667 --> 00:12:33,711
Hey, don't be like that.

163
00:12:33,794 --> 00:12:35,212
You're making me feel bad.

164
00:12:35,296 --> 00:12:36,505
It's not like that.

165
00:12:36,589 --> 00:12:39,216
Everyone has their own preferences.

166
00:12:41,260 --> 00:12:42,928
That actually sounds quite cool.

167
00:12:43,012 --> 00:12:45,973
Why did you start working here?

168
00:12:46,348 --> 00:12:48,893
Because I wanted to live a cool life.

169
00:12:48,976 --> 00:12:51,395
The world's going to end in 1999 anyway.

170
00:12:51,479 --> 00:12:53,189
Nostadamus said that.

171
00:12:53,272 --> 00:12:54,398
Was that his name?

172
00:12:59,403 --> 00:13:01,864
I'll live for four fucking cool years

173
00:13:01,947 --> 00:13:05,284
and then, I'll watch the world end.

174
00:13:06,452 --> 00:13:07,453
What's wrong?

175
00:13:07,536 --> 00:13:11,832
Am I being too Gen X?

176
00:13:12,917 --> 00:13:15,753
Why are people in that car
all wearing masks?

177
00:13:16,504 --> 00:13:18,881
They're suspicious as hell.

178
00:13:20,049 --> 00:13:21,634
-Right?
-What are they doing?

179
00:13:22,051 --> 00:13:23,135
Why masks?

180
00:13:33,020 --> 00:13:34,021
That bastard.

181
00:13:34,480 --> 00:13:37,274
Shit!

182
00:14:06,554 --> 00:14:07,930
Go get Jung Gicheul!

183
00:14:08,013 --> 00:14:10,683
- Hey!
- Jung Gicheul, you bastard!

184
00:14:10,766 --> 00:14:12,643
- Come out!
- Where's Jung Gicheul?

185
00:14:12,726 --> 00:14:14,895
Come out, you bastard!

186
00:14:15,229 --> 00:14:16,564
Come on out, Jung Gicheul!

187
00:14:25,281 --> 00:14:26,282
The lights are off.

188
00:14:27,032 --> 00:14:28,659
Who are those bastards?

189
00:14:30,119 --> 00:14:31,120
Boss is inside.

190
00:14:37,293 --> 00:14:38,544
Fuck.

191
00:14:40,838 --> 00:14:43,048
Boss, we're being attacked.

192
00:14:43,132 --> 00:14:44,174
Take him with you.

193
00:14:44,258 --> 00:14:45,342
Come with me, Boss.

194
00:14:47,261 --> 00:14:48,846
-Boss!
-He's over there!

195
00:14:53,142 --> 00:14:54,184
Get Jung Gicheul!

196
00:14:54,268 --> 00:14:55,644
I'm Jung Gicheul!

197
00:14:57,563 --> 00:14:58,689
Come here, you fucker!

198
00:15:01,442 --> 00:15:02,443
Come here!

199
00:15:40,648 --> 00:15:42,066
I think they all ran.

200
00:15:50,282 --> 00:15:51,325
Are you okay, Boss?

201
00:15:51,951 --> 00:15:52,952
Are you okay?

202
00:15:53,285 --> 00:15:54,286
Yes.

203
00:15:56,163 --> 00:15:58,749
Those motherfuckers.

204
00:16:02,294 --> 00:16:05,089
SEONGMO CLINIC

205
00:16:05,381 --> 00:16:07,049
-Give me a cigarette.
-Yes, sir.

206
00:16:11,804 --> 00:16:13,472
-Give me one too.
-Here, sir.

207
00:16:26,318 --> 00:16:27,444
Does it hurt?

208
00:16:28,278 --> 00:16:29,863
No, I'm fine.

209
00:16:30,072 --> 00:16:31,156
It's just a scratch.

210
00:16:35,077 --> 00:16:37,329
What do we do
with that fucker Song Donghyuk?

211
00:16:37,413 --> 00:16:39,415
If we do nothing,
he'll think we're cowards.

212
00:16:40,040 --> 00:16:42,751
Maybe we should go to Busan
and wipe them all out.

213
00:16:42,835 --> 00:16:44,211
I'll take care of it.

214
00:16:52,970 --> 00:16:55,055
Make sure to keep the wound dry.

215
00:16:55,139 --> 00:16:57,433
-We'll remove the stitches in a week.
-Doctor.

216
00:17:06,900 --> 00:17:07,901
Good job.

217
00:17:08,819 --> 00:17:11,030
I just did what I had to do.

218
00:17:13,699 --> 00:17:17,119
Starting tomorrow,
we'll have Chief Seo on standby

219
00:17:17,202 --> 00:17:19,580
next to your room.
I'm sorry about this, Boss.

220
00:17:22,416 --> 00:17:23,834
I'm Jung Gicheul!

221
00:17:27,171 --> 00:17:28,505
I want Seungho next to me.

222
00:17:34,762 --> 00:17:38,015
Boss, Seungho just joined us.

223
00:17:38,807 --> 00:17:41,685
Don't you think
all our boys would notice that?

224
00:17:45,981 --> 00:17:50,110
Also, we can't keep a guy
who hangs out with cops close to you.

225
00:17:50,194 --> 00:17:52,488
Well, where were you or the other members

226
00:17:53,822 --> 00:17:55,491
when all of this was happening?

227
00:17:57,826 --> 00:17:59,286
Tell me.

228
00:18:00,829 --> 00:18:02,206
Just do as I say.

229
00:18:04,124 --> 00:18:05,125
Yes, Boss.

230
00:18:17,012 --> 00:18:18,180
-Yongdae, at ease.
-Yes.

231
00:18:18,597 --> 00:18:21,600
Get him a cell phone.

232
00:18:21,683 --> 00:18:23,352
-Yes, sir.
-Hey.

233
00:18:23,435 --> 00:18:24,436
Yes?

234
00:18:24,520 --> 00:18:25,729
Get him a new suit too.

235
00:18:26,230 --> 00:18:27,231
Yes, sir.

236
00:18:27,314 --> 00:18:29,149
Seriously, he looks like he's homeless.

237
00:18:29,441 --> 00:18:30,567
Get yourself one too.

238
00:18:30,651 --> 00:18:32,111
Yes...

239
00:18:32,194 --> 00:18:33,278
Yes, sir! Thank you!

240
00:18:51,964 --> 00:18:55,384
Hey, Dohyung. Our plan worked.

241
00:18:56,802 --> 00:19:00,430
Yes. From now on,
I'll be his personal bodyguard.

242
00:19:01,223 --> 00:19:02,224
Good.

243
00:19:02,307 --> 00:19:03,308
<i>By the way,</i>

244
00:19:03,392 --> 00:19:05,519
I think it would be better

245
00:19:06,645 --> 00:19:10,065
to not tell other members
that Jung Gicheul had a gun.

246
00:19:10,649 --> 00:19:12,985
All right. Thanks for your hard work.

247
00:19:13,068 --> 00:19:14,361
Then this big guy suddenly...

248
00:19:16,655 --> 00:19:18,031
-Hello, sir.
-Hello, sir.

249
00:19:18,115 --> 00:19:19,867
You did a great job.
Sit down.

250
00:19:19,950 --> 00:19:21,076
It was a smooth start.

251
00:19:21,160 --> 00:19:23,579
And you stopped next to their car
at the perfect time.

252
00:19:23,704 --> 00:19:26,415
By the way, that guy had some skills.

253
00:19:26,498 --> 00:19:27,833
He acted like he'd hit us,

254
00:19:27,916 --> 00:19:29,668
but then, he'd hit the wall or floor.

255
00:19:29,793 --> 00:19:32,671
He only brushed my thigh. It was amazing.

256
00:19:32,754 --> 00:19:34,590
What kind of work did he do?

257
00:19:34,673 --> 00:19:37,801
He's just a thug. A snitch.

258
00:19:37,885 --> 00:19:38,886
Enjoy your food.

259
00:19:38,969 --> 00:19:39,970
-Yes, sir.
-Yes, sir.

260
00:19:42,389 --> 00:19:43,390
Yes, sir.

261
00:19:43,932 --> 00:19:45,184
All right.

262
00:19:47,019 --> 00:19:49,188
Hey, man. Not there. Here.

263
00:19:50,689 --> 00:19:52,524
-You see that room over there?
-Yes.

264
00:19:52,608 --> 00:19:54,902
The top bunk above the sofa
is yours. Okay?

265
00:19:54,985 --> 00:19:56,278
Yes, sir.

266
00:19:56,361 --> 00:19:57,487
Follow me.

267
00:20:00,908 --> 00:20:02,492
We lock the office with a code.

268
00:20:02,576 --> 00:20:03,577
Okay.

269
00:20:07,122 --> 00:20:08,123
One, two, zero, six.

270
00:20:08,207 --> 00:20:09,541
Yeah, it's my birthday.

271
00:20:10,918 --> 00:20:12,628
What? You have a problem with that?

272
00:20:13,212 --> 00:20:15,255
No, sir. I'll memorize it.

273
00:20:16,798 --> 00:20:18,008
I was just wondering...

274
00:20:19,676 --> 00:20:21,803
What about the other codes here...

275
00:20:21,887 --> 00:20:24,806
God, you have so many fucking questions.

276
00:20:26,183 --> 00:20:27,726
-Hey, look.
-Yes, sir.

277
00:20:27,935 --> 00:20:30,103
This is the only one
you need to know, okay?

278
00:20:30,938 --> 00:20:32,064
Yes, sir.

279
00:21:05,430 --> 00:21:08,684
Hey, it's Seungho. How's everything?

280
00:21:09,768 --> 00:21:12,646
Yes, I'm doing fine.

281
00:21:13,355 --> 00:21:15,774
And I got a cell phone.

282
00:21:20,779 --> 00:21:24,116
Even if they look into
the call history on this phone,

283
00:21:24,199 --> 00:21:26,827
they'll let it slide
for calls with "Euijeong."

284
00:21:27,160 --> 00:21:29,997
So call this number from now on.

285
00:21:35,252 --> 00:21:37,337
You said
your father used to beat you.

286
00:21:37,421 --> 00:21:38,505
Yes, Boss.

287
00:21:38,588 --> 00:21:39,589
Was he a meth addict?

288
00:21:39,798 --> 00:21:40,799
Yes, Boss.

289
00:21:41,800 --> 00:21:43,677
It must've been hard for your mother.

290
00:21:44,469 --> 00:21:46,179
She left us when I was seven.

291
00:21:48,307 --> 00:21:50,350
People like us have similar stories.

292
00:21:51,768 --> 00:21:53,729
How was it seeing her
after all that time?

293
00:21:54,396 --> 00:21:56,773
What do you mean by...

294
00:21:56,857 --> 00:21:59,401
Is Euijeong still easy-going and cool?

295
00:22:00,694 --> 00:22:01,695
Yes.

296
00:22:01,778 --> 00:22:04,990
She should've married a rich guy
and lived comfortably.

297
00:22:05,365 --> 00:22:08,076
Why did she marry
a lame countryside detective?

298
00:22:12,748 --> 00:22:13,749
Come with me.

299
00:22:17,419 --> 00:22:19,379
I'm going out for a second.

300
00:22:19,463 --> 00:22:21,048
You can have dinner without me.

301
00:22:21,673 --> 00:22:22,883
Hey.

302
00:22:23,717 --> 00:22:25,427
Where are you going?

303
00:22:25,510 --> 00:22:27,429
It might be still dangerous.

304
00:22:27,512 --> 00:22:30,307
We're not done
with those Busan bastards yet.

305
00:22:30,390 --> 00:22:32,267
Wouldn't it be risky to split up?

306
00:22:33,185 --> 00:22:34,311
I'll see you later.

307
00:22:35,020 --> 00:22:36,188
Boss.

308
00:22:38,148 --> 00:22:42,069
We ordered some food.
Why don't we have a chat over dinner?

309
00:22:46,114 --> 00:22:48,075
-Take care, Boss.
-Take care, Boss.

310
00:23:05,133 --> 00:23:06,593
May I ask where we're going?

311
00:23:07,594 --> 00:23:08,678
Yeongdong Severance.

312
00:23:14,142 --> 00:23:19,314
YEONGDONG SEVERANCE HOSPITAL

313
00:23:14,142 --> 00:23:19,314
YEONGDONG SEVERANCE HOSPITAL

314
00:23:24,528 --> 00:23:25,529
Let's go.

315
00:23:26,655 --> 00:23:28,907
Apparently, Euijeong's mother is very ill.

316
00:23:29,533 --> 00:23:30,575
Let's go say hi.

317
00:23:31,076 --> 00:23:34,246
I'll stay here, Boss.

318
00:23:34,329 --> 00:23:36,415
You lived next door to them.

319
00:23:36,498 --> 00:23:37,666
You should say hi.

320
00:23:38,417 --> 00:23:40,627
She probably wouldn't remember me anyway.

321
00:23:41,420 --> 00:23:43,338
Also, she's ill.

322
00:23:43,422 --> 00:23:45,841
If I join you,
she'll only be more uncomfortable.

323
00:23:46,425 --> 00:23:48,677
Go ahead. I'll wait here.

324
00:23:55,058 --> 00:23:59,020
YOKOHAMA, JAPAN

325
00:23:59,896 --> 00:24:02,899
Your painting skills are extraordinary.

326
00:24:03,650 --> 00:24:06,236
I'll make sure to frame this painting

327
00:24:06,319 --> 00:24:08,780
and hang it somewhere visible.

328
00:24:09,281 --> 00:24:10,866
By the way,

329
00:24:12,993 --> 00:24:14,578
with Jung Gicheul in Seoul...

330
00:24:15,829 --> 00:24:17,664
What kind of business is he doing?

331
00:24:24,379 --> 00:24:28,300
As far as I know,
he's invested in their bars.

332
00:24:32,095 --> 00:24:36,266
Well, after we get rid of Jung Gicheul,

333
00:24:36,349 --> 00:24:39,102
I'm planning to take over Gangnam myself.

334
00:24:39,269 --> 00:24:41,688
But it shouldn't cause
any harm to my brother.

335
00:24:41,897 --> 00:24:43,231
Jung Gicheul is

336
00:24:43,982 --> 00:24:46,902
treating Boss Kanemoto
like a father figure.

337
00:24:47,986 --> 00:24:49,863
I suggest you reconsider your plan.

338
00:24:52,866 --> 00:24:55,035
We're righteous outlaws.

339
00:24:55,118 --> 00:24:59,498
But that mutt from nowhere Jung Gicheul
has no respect for order and loyalty,

340
00:24:59,581 --> 00:25:01,791
and he's running around chasing money.

341
00:25:01,875 --> 00:25:07,255
Could there be another way?

342
00:25:09,508 --> 00:25:12,802
First of all, I've made up my mind.

343
00:25:15,180 --> 00:25:16,348
Second,

344
00:25:17,057 --> 00:25:18,892
if I make up my mind, I go with it.

345
00:25:20,810 --> 00:25:25,065
Please tell my brother
exactly what I said.

346
00:25:26,983 --> 00:25:27,984
Sure.

347
00:25:30,904 --> 00:25:32,531
Will do.

348
00:25:32,614 --> 00:25:35,325
Once you make up your mind,
you have to act on it

349
00:25:36,743 --> 00:25:38,328
to not have any regrets.

350
00:25:41,748 --> 00:25:42,791
Well...

351
00:25:44,918 --> 00:25:47,379
Sometimes, you let dogs in,
and you let them out.

352
00:25:48,046 --> 00:25:49,047
Exactly.

353
00:25:55,887 --> 00:25:59,349
Goodness, this is cashmere.

354
00:26:00,141 --> 00:26:02,394
You didn't have to buy
such an expensive gift.

355
00:26:03,311 --> 00:26:06,648
Even if you go out for a short walk,
you should always stay warm.

356
00:26:06,773 --> 00:26:07,774
But still...

357
00:26:08,441 --> 00:26:11,653
Wow, that is beautiful.

358
00:26:12,862 --> 00:26:15,532
Not only is your son-in-law
tall and handsome

359
00:26:15,615 --> 00:26:18,618
but he also has a heart of gold.

360
00:26:22,122 --> 00:26:23,707
Is your mother doing well?

361
00:26:25,250 --> 00:26:26,543
Yes, she is.

362
00:26:28,670 --> 00:26:32,340
I'm sure what happened to my mother
caused quite a stir at church.

363
00:26:32,424 --> 00:26:33,925
Of course not.

364
00:26:35,635 --> 00:26:40,140
Your mother was
so dedicated to our church.

365
00:27:00,994 --> 00:27:02,370
Gicheul.

366
00:27:02,454 --> 00:27:03,538
Yes?

367
00:27:03,622 --> 00:27:06,750
Couldn't you find other things to do?

368
00:27:08,209 --> 00:27:10,754
So you think I'm a gangster too?

369
00:27:12,047 --> 00:27:15,634
There are always such rumors
about people in the nightlife business.

370
00:27:15,717 --> 00:27:16,760
Rumors?

371
00:27:17,218 --> 00:27:18,345
Yes.

372
00:27:21,848 --> 00:27:23,975
What I do is, well...

373
00:27:24,684 --> 00:27:26,811
It's like an association.

374
00:27:27,687 --> 00:27:30,565
When young people are
in the nightlife industry,

375
00:27:30,649 --> 00:27:32,901
a lot of people come and pick fights

376
00:27:32,984 --> 00:27:34,110
or look down on them.

377
00:27:34,778 --> 00:27:37,197
I thought we should help each other out.

378
00:27:37,280 --> 00:27:38,990
That's why I started my company.

379
00:27:39,407 --> 00:27:42,243
So you don't do any bad things?

380
00:27:42,661 --> 00:27:45,330
Of course not. Don't worry.

381
00:27:46,915 --> 00:27:49,626
Excuse me.

382
00:27:52,504 --> 00:27:53,505
Hello.

383
00:28:01,930 --> 00:28:03,014
Yes, Father.

384
00:28:04,933 --> 00:28:05,934
<i>There's no choice.</i>

385
00:28:07,102 --> 00:28:09,229
<i>Please, proceed with your plan.</i>

386
00:28:11,272 --> 00:28:12,440
All right.

387
00:28:15,860 --> 00:28:18,279
<i>Kanemoto, what are you doing?</i>

388
00:28:18,863 --> 00:28:20,907
Gicheul is making money for me,

389
00:28:20,990 --> 00:28:23,076
and you want to kill him, you bastard?

390
00:28:29,499 --> 00:28:31,209
Kanemoto...

391
00:28:34,212 --> 00:28:35,672
You bastards.

392
00:28:36,464 --> 00:28:37,716
You fucking bastards.

393
00:28:38,883 --> 00:28:40,009
Stay away, you fucks!

394
00:28:40,218 --> 00:28:42,137
Hey, you. Drop the gun.

395
00:28:42,220 --> 00:28:45,140
He's Japanese,
so he doesn't understand Korean.

396
00:28:45,390 --> 00:28:46,683
It's too dangerous.

397
00:28:47,600 --> 00:28:48,601
Shoot him.

398
00:29:09,122 --> 00:29:10,373
Fuck.

399
00:29:23,678 --> 00:29:24,679
Song Donghyuk.

400
00:29:25,722 --> 00:29:27,515
Father took care of him.

401
00:29:29,225 --> 00:29:30,435
What?

402
00:29:30,518 --> 00:29:32,395
I said I'd take care of it. Remember?

403
00:29:34,856 --> 00:29:37,859
That petty old fuck.
Serves you fucking right.

404
00:29:42,322 --> 00:29:43,323
Good morning, sir.

405
00:29:45,950 --> 00:29:47,952
-Hey, newbie. Come here.
-Yes, sir.

406
00:29:48,745 --> 00:29:50,371
I see you got your beauty sleep.

407
00:29:52,081 --> 00:29:53,958
Look, your skin's glowing.

408
00:29:54,292 --> 00:29:55,460
Goddamn.

409
00:29:55,543 --> 00:29:56,711
So shiny.

410
00:29:57,587 --> 00:29:58,713
Come in, asshole.

411
00:30:00,006 --> 00:30:01,800
Motherfucker.

412
00:30:09,098 --> 00:30:10,517
-You pack everything?
-Yes.

413
00:30:10,600 --> 00:30:12,060
I put everything in.

414
00:30:17,148 --> 00:30:18,525
-Hey, take these.
-Yes, sir.

415
00:30:25,490 --> 00:30:26,741
Pick that shit up.

416
00:30:31,704 --> 00:30:33,748
Today's a good day, assholes.

417
00:30:33,832 --> 00:30:35,792
- It's a company dinner, okay?
- Yes, sir.

418
00:30:35,875 --> 00:30:37,585
- Understood?
- Yes, sir!

419
00:30:38,044 --> 00:30:39,546
We'll do our best, Boss.

420
00:30:40,255 --> 00:30:41,297
Enjoy your dinner.

421
00:30:41,381 --> 00:30:43,091
-Thank you, Boss!
-Thank you, Boss!

422
00:30:43,550 --> 00:30:45,134
Excuse me, sir. Here.

423
00:30:48,638 --> 00:30:49,639
Enjoy your food.

424
00:31:09,576 --> 00:31:10,743
Can I ask something?

425
00:31:11,077 --> 00:31:15,331
How often does Boss go fishing?

426
00:31:16,791 --> 00:31:18,293
About a couple times a month.

427
00:31:19,210 --> 00:31:20,378
I see.

428
00:31:21,546 --> 00:31:23,965
What do I do while Boss is gone?

429
00:31:24,883 --> 00:31:28,344
What? You want to go out or something?

430
00:31:29,804 --> 00:31:31,472
Stay at your goddamn post.

431
00:31:31,598 --> 00:31:32,849
I'm off to have a drink.

432
00:31:33,516 --> 00:31:34,893
Call me if something's up.

433
00:31:38,897 --> 00:31:40,982
What an asshole.

434
00:32:02,253 --> 00:32:03,630
How are the waves?

435
00:32:04,005 --> 00:32:05,089
They're calm today.

436
00:32:19,437 --> 00:32:22,774
When Boss goes on fishing trips,

437
00:32:23,149 --> 00:32:24,984
when does he usually come back?

438
00:32:25,526 --> 00:32:27,695
Sometimes, he stays one night.

439
00:32:27,779 --> 00:32:29,405
Sometimes, it's two nights.

440
00:32:30,281 --> 00:32:31,491
He's not coming tonight.

441
00:32:34,619 --> 00:32:36,371
It's late. Aren't you going to bed?

442
00:32:36,913 --> 00:32:37,914
What's it to you?

443
00:32:39,248 --> 00:32:40,583
Go sweep that inner area.

444
00:32:43,711 --> 00:32:45,254
Let's go out and drink.

445
00:32:45,338 --> 00:32:46,714
-Yes, sir.
-Yes, sir.

446
00:32:46,798 --> 00:32:48,257
Come on out.

447
00:32:48,341 --> 00:32:50,468
This fucker's already drunk.

448
00:32:55,014 --> 00:32:56,015
Want to come too?

449
00:32:56,265 --> 00:32:57,558
No, it's okay.

450
00:32:58,226 --> 00:33:00,228
-Keep the place safe.
-Yes, sir.

451
00:33:00,311 --> 00:33:01,354
Take care, sir.

452
00:34:27,148 --> 00:34:28,608
GANGNAM UNION BIRTHDATES

453
00:34:44,165 --> 00:34:46,459
Damn.

454
00:34:58,012 --> 00:34:59,347
Euijeong's birthday.

455
00:35:08,773 --> 00:35:10,608
That son of a bitch.

456
00:35:12,777 --> 00:35:14,153
Motherfucker.

457
00:35:37,844 --> 00:35:40,346
So nothing special was found
in Jung Gicheul's room?

458
00:35:40,888 --> 00:35:41,931
That's right.

459
00:35:43,474 --> 00:35:45,977
Isn't it strange though?

460
00:35:46,519 --> 00:35:50,148
These bastards always go fishing
a couple times a month,

461
00:35:50,815 --> 00:35:53,276
but there is no fishing gear in the room.

462
00:35:54,110 --> 00:35:56,529
So he might not be actually going fishing.

463
00:36:00,408 --> 00:36:03,327
I'll see if I can make him
invite me to the fishing trips.

464
00:36:05,246 --> 00:36:06,789
TOKYO METROPOLITAN
POLICE DEPARTMENT, JAPAN

465
00:36:06,873 --> 00:36:08,499
Korean mob boss, Song Donghyuk.

466
00:36:08,583 --> 00:36:10,668
He may be involved in the meth trade

467
00:36:10,751 --> 00:36:12,587
according to our Korean sources.

468
00:36:12,712 --> 00:36:16,340
He entered Japan via Narita Airport
on the 15th, and now he's missing.

469
00:36:16,424 --> 00:36:19,343
His ID was found on Miura Coast
in Kanagawa Prefecture.

470
00:36:19,427 --> 00:36:21,095
We suspect he was killed nearby,

471
00:36:21,179 --> 00:36:23,306
and his body was dumped into the sea.

472
00:36:23,806 --> 00:36:24,849
Starting today,

473
00:36:24,932 --> 00:36:26,893
we'll focus our surveillance

474
00:36:26,976 --> 00:36:29,729
to Yoshioka-gumi gangsters
in Tokyo, Chiba, and Kanagawa.

475
00:36:29,812 --> 00:36:30,855
Understood?

476
00:36:30,938 --> 00:36:31,939
-Yes, sir!
-Yes, sir!

477
00:36:49,457 --> 00:36:50,458
Hey.

478
00:38:06,200 --> 00:38:07,660
Ta-da.

479
00:38:07,743 --> 00:38:09,161
Gangnam Crystal.

480
00:38:12,248 --> 00:38:14,292
This really has 99% purity?

481
00:38:14,375 --> 00:38:15,835
Please spread the word.

482
00:38:15,918 --> 00:38:16,919
Okay.

483
00:38:24,719 --> 00:38:26,012
Smash.

484
00:38:26,971 --> 00:38:28,014
Smash!

485
00:38:33,060 --> 00:38:34,979
This is fun.

486
00:38:35,062 --> 00:38:37,356
-Throttle up?
-Throttle up.

487
00:38:38,482 --> 00:38:39,734
Please don't kill me!

488
00:38:41,277 --> 00:38:42,278
Please!

489
00:38:47,658 --> 00:38:49,493
Please don't kill me!

490
00:38:49,577 --> 00:38:50,619
Stop.

491
00:38:54,290 --> 00:38:56,667
Whose stuff were you selling
until recently?

492
00:39:03,466 --> 00:39:04,717
Who could it be?

493
00:39:07,178 --> 00:39:08,679
This man.

494
00:39:10,639 --> 00:39:12,099
But what are you selling now?

495
00:39:13,225 --> 00:39:14,477
Gangnam Crystal?

496
00:39:36,916 --> 00:39:38,209
Who's your boss?

497
00:39:40,044 --> 00:39:41,462
I need to meet him.

498
00:39:45,424 --> 00:39:47,218
Come here. Raise your head.

499
00:39:47,301 --> 00:39:49,595
Keep your head up and mouth shut.

500
00:39:49,678 --> 00:39:51,180
Keep it shut!

501
00:39:52,723 --> 00:39:56,268
Wait. Just one second.

502
00:39:56,519 --> 00:39:58,771
Shut it!

503
00:39:58,854 --> 00:40:00,064
One last hit.

504
00:40:10,282 --> 00:40:12,785
This huge flashlight's useless.

505
00:40:16,372 --> 00:40:19,917
Instead of goofing around all day,
just change the battery.

506
00:40:37,518 --> 00:40:38,978
You didn't buy this, right?

507
00:40:43,941 --> 00:40:46,110
Maybe those Busan bastards dropped it

508
00:40:46,193 --> 00:40:48,028
when they attacked us the other day.

509
00:40:49,029 --> 00:40:51,949
Are you saying they were cops?

510
00:40:52,032 --> 00:40:53,200
Why would cops do that?

511
00:40:55,077 --> 00:40:56,412
I don't know.

512
00:40:58,664 --> 00:41:00,499
So the cops pretended to be thugs

513
00:41:00,583 --> 00:41:02,418
and destroyed our office?

514
00:41:03,794 --> 00:41:04,962
But why?

515
00:41:12,928 --> 00:41:14,054
Excuse me.

516
00:41:16,682 --> 00:41:18,058
Hey, what's up?

517
00:41:18,142 --> 00:41:19,143
Yeah.

518
00:41:20,144 --> 00:41:23,022
Okay. Wait there.

519
00:41:31,405 --> 00:41:32,406
Smith.

520
00:41:32,531 --> 00:41:33,866
Yes, Manager Cho?

521
00:41:33,949 --> 00:41:35,326
Do you think he came alone?

522
00:41:36,118 --> 00:41:37,161
It seems like it.

523
00:41:37,953 --> 00:41:39,079
Wake up Baby.

524
00:41:41,248 --> 00:41:44,502
-Damn it.
-Where is...

525
00:41:52,051 --> 00:41:54,094
-Get out of the car.
-Get the fuck out.

526
00:41:54,178 --> 00:41:56,597
Come on. Move your ass.

527
00:41:57,306 --> 00:41:58,557
Idiot.

528
00:42:06,148 --> 00:42:07,358
You've got a nice watch.

529
00:42:08,692 --> 00:42:09,693
Right.

530
00:42:10,528 --> 00:42:11,737
You came alone, right?

531
00:42:11,820 --> 00:42:12,905
Yes, sir.

532
00:42:14,490 --> 00:42:15,491
Baby.

533
00:42:16,700 --> 00:42:18,160
Hey. Your arms.

534
00:42:18,911 --> 00:42:20,412
Let's see...

535
00:42:24,166 --> 00:42:25,668
Hold on.

536
00:42:25,751 --> 00:42:27,378
Let me just...

537
00:42:32,758 --> 00:42:35,678
We can't talk here,
so let's go somewhere private.

538
00:42:40,641 --> 00:42:42,142
I'm sorry.

539
00:43:02,705 --> 00:43:05,249
We can't leave a dead body
at an elementary school.

540
00:43:06,834 --> 00:43:08,586
It'll scare the kids.

541
00:43:09,545 --> 00:43:10,546
Right?

542
00:43:11,839 --> 00:43:13,048
You're right, sir.

543
00:43:23,100 --> 00:43:24,101
Escort him.

544
00:43:36,697 --> 00:43:38,407
What a fucking sweet watch.

545
00:43:38,490 --> 00:43:40,576
Man, I'm so fucking jealous!

546
00:43:42,119 --> 00:43:46,206
God damn it.

547
00:43:47,374 --> 00:43:49,710
Here. Try on the watch.

548
00:43:50,502 --> 00:43:51,503
How is it?

549
00:43:53,464 --> 00:43:55,758
What the hell?

550
00:43:55,883 --> 00:43:57,009
What is it doing?

551
00:43:57,551 --> 00:43:59,053
Manager Cho.

552
00:43:59,136 --> 00:44:02,014
Hey! What the hell are you doing?

553
00:44:07,186 --> 00:44:09,688
What? What the fuck?

554
00:44:10,314 --> 00:44:12,107
Hey, Baby. Go check it out.

555
00:44:14,568 --> 00:44:16,362
My neck fucking hurts.

556
00:44:17,112 --> 00:44:18,238
Damn it!

557
00:44:26,497 --> 00:44:27,665
Hey, lady!

558
00:44:28,082 --> 00:44:31,877
Get out of the car!
My neck hurts like hell!

559
00:44:31,960 --> 00:44:33,045
Lady!

560
00:44:34,672 --> 00:44:35,881
What?

561
00:44:39,635 --> 00:44:40,803
What the fuck?

562
00:44:40,886 --> 00:44:42,930
Hey! I can't fucking see!

563
00:44:45,432 --> 00:44:47,351
Fuck!

564
00:44:47,434 --> 00:44:49,561
You fucking...

565
00:45:18,173 --> 00:45:19,341
Kwon Seungho.

566
00:45:19,425 --> 00:45:20,592
Yes?

567
00:45:21,301 --> 00:45:22,302
Hey.

568
00:45:23,971 --> 00:45:24,972
Follow me.

569
00:45:27,182 --> 00:45:28,183
Come on.

570
00:45:58,255 --> 00:45:59,465
Hey.

571
00:45:59,548 --> 00:46:03,594
Who said you could wear
fancy underwear like this, you prick?

572
00:46:04,428 --> 00:46:05,763
You fucking piece of shit.

573
00:46:07,014 --> 00:46:08,140
Hey.

574
00:46:09,349 --> 00:46:10,517
Motherfucker.

575
00:46:10,976 --> 00:46:12,311
Come on.

576
00:46:12,394 --> 00:46:13,896
Answer me.

577
00:46:13,979 --> 00:46:14,980
Who's that?

578
00:46:16,064 --> 00:46:17,316
Hey, there.

579
00:46:18,150 --> 00:46:21,153
He's such an asshole.

580
00:46:21,236 --> 00:46:22,654
He tried to kill Boss

581
00:46:22,738 --> 00:46:23,864
and ruin our business.

582
00:46:23,947 --> 00:46:25,449
What should we do with him?

583
00:46:28,076 --> 00:46:29,077
We should kill him.

584
00:46:29,369 --> 00:46:30,829
Right? You think so too?

585
00:46:31,121 --> 00:46:34,124
You son of a bitch.

586
00:46:37,795 --> 00:46:38,796
It wasn't you?

587
00:46:39,880 --> 00:46:41,256
Then, why would we do this?

588
00:46:42,090 --> 00:46:43,967
You think this shit's for no reason?

589
00:46:44,760 --> 00:46:46,595
-No?
-Stop shaking, you bitch.

590
00:46:48,055 --> 00:46:49,723
You fucker.

591
00:46:49,807 --> 00:46:51,099
Raise your head.

592
00:46:51,183 --> 00:46:53,060
Fucking bastard.

593
00:46:55,145 --> 00:46:56,146
Hold him up.

594
00:46:59,566 --> 00:47:00,609
Hey.

595
00:47:00,692 --> 00:47:01,693
Come on.

596
00:47:01,777 --> 00:47:03,403
Put your arms up.

597
00:47:03,487 --> 00:47:04,571
Hold him tight.

598
00:47:04,655 --> 00:47:05,864
One, two, three.

599
00:47:08,116 --> 00:47:10,661
You think that's going to kill him?

600
00:47:10,744 --> 00:47:12,037
You do it then.

601
00:47:12,120 --> 00:47:13,413
Do you like him or something?

602
00:47:13,747 --> 00:47:15,290
So you do it, motherfucker.

603
00:47:17,000 --> 00:47:18,085
Pick him up.

604
00:47:19,753 --> 00:47:21,296
I'm going to hit him here.

605
00:47:21,630 --> 00:47:22,631
Right here.

606
00:47:25,968 --> 00:47:27,845
Fucking bitch.

607
00:47:31,640 --> 00:47:32,641
Motherfucker.

608
00:47:33,892 --> 00:47:35,018
Stop tensing, bitch.

609
00:47:39,439 --> 00:47:42,234
This bitch deserves a spanking
for the nice underwear.

610
00:47:42,317 --> 00:47:43,318
Come here.

611
00:47:45,696 --> 00:47:46,780
Spanking time, bitch.

612
00:47:48,365 --> 00:47:49,408
One.

613
00:47:50,701 --> 00:47:52,160
Two.

614
00:47:53,662 --> 00:47:55,497
One more time.

615
00:47:55,581 --> 00:47:58,125
-Three.
-Enough. Stop.

616
00:48:00,586 --> 00:48:02,254
Enough with the play. Wrap it up.

617
00:48:03,797 --> 00:48:04,798
Yes, Boss.

618
00:48:22,816 --> 00:48:24,109
You finish it.

619
00:48:27,362 --> 00:48:28,780
So I can trust you.

620
00:48:52,304 --> 00:48:53,305
Shoot him.

621
00:49:04,149 --> 00:49:05,150
I said shoot.

622
00:49:05,859 --> 00:49:08,403
Damn it.

623
00:49:44,523 --> 00:49:45,607
Shoot!

624
00:49:49,236 --> 00:49:51,154
Fucking hell.
