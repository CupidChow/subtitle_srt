1
00:01:58,535 --> 00:01:59,369
Was it you?

2
00:02:01,955 --> 00:02:04,124
Why did you crash the plane, you bastard!

3
00:02:06,918 --> 00:02:09,629
Get out, you piece of shit!

4
00:02:38,867 --> 00:02:41,286
The grieving family members called again.

5
00:02:41,828 --> 00:02:44,539
-Making them wait any longer would be--
-I'll be down in 30 minutes.

6
00:02:44,622 --> 00:02:45,832
I'll get everything ready.

7
00:03:04,392 --> 00:03:06,352
Do you know how long we've been waiting?

8
00:03:06,436 --> 00:03:08,646
You're outright ignoring us.

9
00:03:08,730 --> 00:03:10,565
They didn't run off, did they?

10
00:03:10,648 --> 00:03:12,984
-Call them right now!
-What's going on?

11
00:03:13,067 --> 00:03:14,694
I'm sorry. I'm so sorry.

12
00:03:15,195 --> 00:03:16,404
What the hell is this?

13
00:03:16,487 --> 00:03:17,363
What's going on?

14
00:03:17,447 --> 00:03:19,657
-He should've come down by now.
-You can't do this to us!

15
00:03:19,741 --> 00:03:22,327
-Why won't you answer me?
-I apologize.

16
00:03:26,414 --> 00:03:27,832
Sorry I'm late.

17
00:03:28,499 --> 00:03:32,462
I'm Edward Park,
chief negotiator for Dynamic System.

18
00:03:34,881 --> 00:03:36,507
-We've lost our children!
-Please stop.

19
00:03:36,591 --> 00:03:37,842
You bastard!

20
00:03:37,926 --> 00:03:39,385
Bring my child back to life!

21
00:03:39,469 --> 00:03:40,762
Bring him back!

22
00:03:42,347 --> 00:03:43,348
Bring my husband back!

23
00:03:43,681 --> 00:03:44,599
Is this a joke?

24
00:03:44,682 --> 00:03:45,975
You killed my little brother!

25
00:03:46,059 --> 00:03:47,644
Bring my husband back to life!

26
00:03:47,727 --> 00:03:48,853
You're a murderer!

27
00:03:48,937 --> 00:03:51,481
-Mr. Kwang-deok, calm down.
-Get off me!

28
00:03:51,564 --> 00:03:52,398
Hey.

29
00:03:53,775 --> 00:03:54,651
Throw it.

30
00:03:55,318 --> 00:03:57,111
-What?
-Throw it.

31
00:03:57,403 --> 00:03:59,989
Son of a...

32
00:04:09,624 --> 00:04:13,253
You can call me names
and hit me all you want.

33
00:04:14,671 --> 00:04:16,839
Show us how much anger and grief

34
00:04:17,423 --> 00:04:18,841
you're feeling right now.

35
00:04:19,342 --> 00:04:20,885
What the hell are you talking about?

36
00:04:20,969 --> 00:04:25,723
Dynamic System told me
to settle with you for the lowest price.

37
00:04:26,808 --> 00:04:27,934
Are you kidding me?

38
00:04:28,017 --> 00:04:31,479
211 deceased passengers,
that's just a number to them.

39
00:04:31,938 --> 00:04:34,065
But those 211 passengers
are not just a number.

40
00:04:34,357 --> 00:04:36,150
They're your dear husbands, wives,
and children,

41
00:04:36,526 --> 00:04:39,529
who should be here,
smiling by your sides right now.

42
00:04:40,446 --> 00:04:41,864
They need to know this.

43
00:04:43,908 --> 00:04:46,244
Aren't you one of them?

44
00:04:46,577 --> 00:04:47,620
Well, actually...

45
00:04:48,746 --> 00:04:50,873
five years ago, a plane crash...

46
00:04:55,211 --> 00:04:57,046
took the lives of my wife and daughter.

47
00:05:01,384 --> 00:05:03,511
It was my daughter's birthday...

48
00:05:04,012 --> 00:05:05,346
but her party was canceled...

49
00:05:07,181 --> 00:05:09,100
because I said I was busy.

50
00:05:10,476 --> 00:05:12,520
If only we'd had dinner together
that day...

51
00:05:13,271 --> 00:05:14,856
If we'd had that dinner...

52
00:05:15,481 --> 00:05:17,066
my wife and daughter...

53
00:05:17,942 --> 00:05:20,111
wouldn't have been on that plane.

54
00:05:24,032 --> 00:05:26,701
Mi-seon wanted her husband
to have his own judo studio...

55
00:05:28,411 --> 00:05:32,665
so she sold gimbap at her store
till late at night.

56
00:05:42,091 --> 00:05:43,551
Kim Woo-gi, the co-pilot,

57
00:05:44,135 --> 00:05:47,096
his dream was running
a horse ranch on Jeju Island.

58
00:05:50,141 --> 00:05:52,435
He was more at home on land
than in the sky.

59
00:06:00,318 --> 00:06:02,070
Pil-yong was Pil-sun's little brother...

60
00:06:03,529 --> 00:06:06,991
whom she raised like her own son.

61
00:06:11,079 --> 00:06:12,163
Ui-jeong,

62
00:06:13,039 --> 00:06:17,168
Yong-jae, So-dam, Hyeok-jin, Jeong-su...

63
00:06:18,294 --> 00:06:20,213
They were all precious people...

64
00:06:21,506 --> 00:06:23,925
who shouldn't have died the way they did.

65
00:06:29,722 --> 00:06:31,224
This is terrible.

66
00:06:36,771 --> 00:06:38,439
My job is done.

67
00:06:38,606 --> 00:06:40,483
How much longer do I have to stay here?

68
00:06:59,377 --> 00:07:05,383
I feel like this is my last opportunity
to make amends with my wife and daughter.

69
00:07:06,843 --> 00:07:10,304
Please support me
in my fight against Dynamic System.

70
00:07:11,139 --> 00:07:13,057
I'll make sure to get

71
00:07:13,141 --> 00:07:18,771
whatever it is you want from them.
I mean it.

72
00:07:24,402 --> 00:07:25,445
Dal-geon?

73
00:07:25,862 --> 00:07:27,071
-Gosh.
-Dal-geon?

74
00:07:27,155 --> 00:07:28,448
There's a survivor!

75
00:07:29,073 --> 00:07:33,161
The plane crashed,
but there's a bastard who survived.

76
00:07:37,290 --> 00:07:38,291
You must be Mr. Cha Dal-geon.

77
00:07:39,917 --> 00:07:41,836
I'm not sure I understand what you mean--

78
00:07:41,919 --> 00:07:43,671
That bastard tried to shoot me!

79
00:07:46,924 --> 00:07:50,219
I know it sounds crazy...

80
00:07:51,262 --> 00:07:53,097
but I definitely saw him.

81
00:07:53,556 --> 00:07:55,516
I really did see him!

82
00:07:55,850 --> 00:07:56,767
Dal-geon...

83
00:07:57,143 --> 00:07:58,936
are you out of your mind?

84
00:07:59,020 --> 00:08:00,396
I'm not crazy.

85
00:08:00,771 --> 00:08:02,398
I'm completely sane!

86
00:08:03,191 --> 00:08:05,109
I was chasing after him...

87
00:08:06,611 --> 00:08:08,321
This is driving me nuts.

88
00:08:08,404 --> 00:08:09,572
So...

89
00:08:09,655 --> 00:08:11,073
what you're saying is...

90
00:08:11,824 --> 00:08:14,202
-you think the plane crash was--
-A terrorist attack.

91
00:08:14,827 --> 00:08:15,786
I'm sure of it!

92
00:08:18,372 --> 00:08:19,832
A terrorist attack?

93
00:08:19,916 --> 00:08:21,417
What does he mean, a terrorist attack?

94
00:08:21,501 --> 00:08:24,629
The plane exploded when it crashed.
Nobody could have survived that.

95
00:08:24,712 --> 00:08:26,923
That's why this is driving me crazy!

96
00:08:27,006 --> 00:08:29,842
I saw him clearly, with my own two eyes!

97
00:08:29,926 --> 00:08:32,386
Wait, walk us through it calmly.

98
00:08:32,470 --> 00:08:34,972
-Who did you see and where?
-Right.

99
00:08:35,556 --> 00:08:38,142
There's one other person
who saw him besides me.

100
00:08:40,019 --> 00:08:41,854
She must have...

101
00:08:46,651 --> 00:08:48,694
Maybe I shouldn't be here.

102
00:08:48,778 --> 00:08:49,612
Wait!

103
00:08:50,655 --> 00:08:53,866
Do you remember the guy
I told you to stop at the airport?

104
00:08:54,450 --> 00:08:55,284
Excuse me?

105
00:08:56,452 --> 00:08:58,412
Wait a moment.

106
00:08:58,913 --> 00:08:59,747
Come here!

107
00:09:01,123 --> 00:09:01,958
What?

108
00:09:18,432 --> 00:09:20,601
Look, it's the same guy!

109
00:09:21,394 --> 00:09:22,353
You remember him, right?

110
00:09:30,403 --> 00:09:31,571
Well...

111
00:09:35,324 --> 00:09:38,452
I'm not sure. It was so hectic,
and I only saw him for a second.

112
00:09:38,786 --> 00:09:40,329
Please try harder!

113
00:09:58,139 --> 00:09:59,599
I don't remember.

114
00:10:01,642 --> 00:10:04,645
What do you have a head and eyes for?!

115
00:10:05,521 --> 00:10:07,315
Why are you yelling at me?

116
00:10:08,733 --> 00:10:10,484
Check the airport's security footage.

117
00:10:12,111 --> 00:10:14,697
You'll believe me when you see it!

118
00:10:14,780 --> 00:10:17,491
-Okay, let's go.
-Let's go to the airport.

119
00:10:17,575 --> 00:10:18,951
-I'll go.
-Okay.

120
00:10:19,035 --> 00:10:21,537
-Sure.
-No way. What kind of nonsense...?

121
00:10:32,423 --> 00:10:34,508
Stop! That man right there.

122
00:10:53,861 --> 00:10:54,862
It's not him.

123
00:10:55,363 --> 00:10:57,281
He doesn't have a scar on his face.

124
00:10:58,032 --> 00:10:59,241
You were mistaken.

125
00:10:59,700 --> 00:11:01,786
Ask them to show us a different clip.

126
00:11:06,457 --> 00:11:07,291
This one!

127
00:11:10,378 --> 00:11:11,504
Right there.

128
00:11:29,689 --> 00:11:32,775
What are you doing,
wasting our time like this?

129
00:11:33,234 --> 00:11:34,985
I think he made an honest mistake.

130
00:11:35,569 --> 00:11:36,821
Shall we go?

131
00:11:38,322 --> 00:11:39,156
Wait.

132
00:11:41,575 --> 00:11:43,536
That bastard messed
with the security footage.

133
00:11:43,786 --> 00:11:44,620
Mr. Cha Dal-geon...

134
00:11:44,704 --> 00:11:46,664
I saw him with my own two eyes!

135
00:11:48,958 --> 00:11:50,543
I swear on my life!

136
00:11:51,711 --> 00:11:53,045
Please believe me!

137
00:11:53,129 --> 00:11:56,924
Who cares if you swear on your life?
How could you do this to us?

138
00:11:57,091 --> 00:11:58,926
We're going through enough as it is.

139
00:11:59,885 --> 00:12:03,305
These things can be
easily manipulated, right?

140
00:12:04,390 --> 00:12:06,934
Someone capable of crashing a plane
could also do something like this!

141
00:12:07,017 --> 00:12:09,186
"Manipulated"? Manipulated, my ass!

142
00:12:09,270 --> 00:12:12,231
Please stop. We shouldn't be fighting
among ourselves.

143
00:12:12,314 --> 00:12:13,941
We're on a tight schedule.

144
00:12:14,525 --> 00:12:15,401
Let's go.

145
00:12:19,864 --> 00:12:20,698
Hey...

146
00:12:21,782 --> 00:12:23,534
I run a judo studio...

147
00:12:24,660 --> 00:12:26,370
so I'm very patient.

148
00:12:27,079 --> 00:12:29,832
We've all suffered enough.

149
00:12:29,915 --> 00:12:31,709
Don't add to the pain, okay?

150
00:13:35,272 --> 00:13:36,649
His name is Cha Dal-geon.

151
00:13:38,067 --> 00:13:40,361
A member of his family died
on flight B357.

152
00:13:40,444 --> 00:13:41,612
What is he?

153
00:13:42,738 --> 00:13:44,323
FBI? NIS?

154
00:13:44,657 --> 00:13:45,574
He's a stuntman.

155
00:13:49,578 --> 00:13:50,538
A stuntman?

156
00:13:54,208 --> 00:13:55,668
Samael is looking for you.

157
00:14:03,926 --> 00:14:05,678
SAMAEL JOINED THE CHAT

158
00:14:13,394 --> 00:14:16,772
If you keep disobeying his orders,
you're as good as dead.

159
00:14:17,481 --> 00:14:19,859
My honor is more important than my life.

160
00:14:20,192 --> 00:14:23,571
I won't go back until it's restored.

161
00:14:27,533 --> 00:14:30,035
I can't help you.

162
00:14:30,119 --> 00:14:34,081
Don't worry, Busra.
I know someone who can.

163
00:14:57,813 --> 00:14:59,607
WOULD YOU LIKE TO OPEN OR SAVE THIS FILE?
SAVE

164
00:15:04,361 --> 00:15:05,529
SAVING FILE

165
00:15:52,201 --> 00:15:53,911
Ho-sik? It's Cha Dal-geon.

166
00:15:54,036 --> 00:15:55,996
Do you know where
Ms. Go Hae-ri is staying?

167
00:15:56,538 --> 00:15:57,581
Why do you ask?

168
00:15:58,207 --> 00:16:01,001
I have to give her something,
but she's not picking up.

169
00:16:08,842 --> 00:16:09,885
Ms. Go Hae-ri!

170
00:16:12,221 --> 00:16:13,389
Ms. Go Hae-ri!

171
00:16:18,769 --> 00:16:19,770
Ms. Go Hae-ri!

172
00:16:20,896 --> 00:16:21,855
Ms. Go Hae-ri!

173
00:16:45,170 --> 00:16:47,464
-Go Hae-ri?
-What are you doing here?

174
00:16:48,340 --> 00:16:49,800
Are you one of them?

175
00:16:51,051 --> 00:16:53,220
-What?
-Who are you?

176
00:16:56,098 --> 00:16:57,307
Who the hell are you?!

177
00:17:01,812 --> 00:17:05,107
Answer the question.
Who are you, really?

178
00:17:13,157 --> 00:17:17,286
So... you think I'm working
with the terrorist?

179
00:17:17,995 --> 00:17:20,039
Are you out of your mind?

180
00:17:20,706 --> 00:17:22,082
What do you think I--?

181
00:17:25,836 --> 00:17:26,712
Where is he?

182
00:17:26,795 --> 00:17:29,840
-Mr. Cha Dal-geon, look--
-I'm this close to losing it!

183
00:17:30,674 --> 00:17:32,051
Talk, or I'll blow your brains out.

184
00:17:36,847 --> 00:17:37,890
Then shoot me.

185
00:17:38,348 --> 00:17:40,642
-What?
-You're obviously crazy.

186
00:17:41,393 --> 00:17:44,688
-Pull the trigger. Do it!
-Shut up!

187
00:17:51,695 --> 00:17:54,073
I get that you're feeling crazy right now,

188
00:17:54,406 --> 00:17:57,034
but how can you accuse me
of being a terrorist?

189
00:17:58,077 --> 00:18:00,204
What are you doing? Let me go!

190
00:18:00,537 --> 00:18:02,664
-You crazy bast--
-Don't move.

191
00:18:02,748 --> 00:18:05,125
Do you want to be in big trouble?

192
00:18:05,209 --> 00:18:06,502
You'll regret this--

193
00:18:07,252 --> 00:18:09,129
-That hurts!
-Don't move!

194
00:18:22,768 --> 00:18:26,772
Don't you know what serious crimes
you're committing?

195
00:18:27,898 --> 00:18:31,693
Breaking and entering,
unlawful detainment, intimidation...

196
00:18:46,625 --> 00:18:47,709
Don't!

197
00:18:48,544 --> 00:18:49,586
Don't you touch it.

198
00:18:57,970 --> 00:18:59,429
What a pervert.

199
00:19:00,639 --> 00:19:02,224
Add sexual harassment to the list.

200
00:19:25,747 --> 00:19:27,958
NATIONAL INTELLIGENCE SERVICE

201
00:19:28,500 --> 00:19:29,459
What is this?

202
00:19:32,004 --> 00:19:33,255
National Intelligence Service?

203
00:19:33,338 --> 00:19:35,174
Now that you know, untie me.

204
00:19:36,550 --> 00:19:38,385
I told you you'd be in trouble.

205
00:19:39,344 --> 00:19:42,681
Damn it. I'm going to get punished
for having my cover blown.

206
00:19:45,809 --> 00:19:47,019
Untie me now.

207
00:19:47,769 --> 00:19:50,189
-There are tons of props like this on set.
-What?

208
00:19:50,272 --> 00:19:52,191
Want to see mine? I'm with the CIA.

209
00:19:53,775 --> 00:19:56,028
I'm telling you,
I'm a special agent with the NIS.

210
00:19:56,111 --> 00:19:59,489
How special are you
now that you're tied up and disarmed?

211
00:19:59,865 --> 00:20:01,700
I can speak three languages.

212
00:20:01,783 --> 00:20:04,328
The NIS isn't just full of people
who are good at fighting.

213
00:20:04,411 --> 00:20:06,872
Smart agents like me
are considered more special.

214
00:20:06,955 --> 00:20:08,457
Get your facts straight.

215
00:20:19,343 --> 00:20:21,511
-Who's M?
-Don't answer it.

216
00:20:21,970 --> 00:20:23,555
I'll be fired if you do.

217
00:20:25,265 --> 00:20:26,266
Answer it.

218
00:20:29,061 --> 00:20:30,229
Hey, Go Hae-ri.

219
00:20:30,771 --> 00:20:32,231
Damn it.

220
00:20:34,316 --> 00:20:35,609
Hello?

221
00:20:39,112 --> 00:20:40,113
Yes, chief.

222
00:20:40,447 --> 00:20:43,659
Ambassador O Jae-gwan
was arrested upon his arrival in Korea.

223
00:20:44,284 --> 00:20:45,452
Good work.

224
00:20:46,453 --> 00:20:49,331
By the way, when can I return

225
00:20:49,998 --> 00:20:51,667
to the National Intelligence Service?

226
00:20:52,501 --> 00:20:54,336
Stay there for the time being.

227
00:20:54,419 --> 00:20:56,380
Everything is running smoothly
without you here.

228
00:20:57,005 --> 00:20:59,925
Sir, how can you say such hurtful words?

229
00:21:00,008 --> 00:21:00,842
MIN JAE-SIK, DIRECTOR
NIS BUREAU 7

230
00:21:00,926 --> 00:21:04,721
Nobody could've handled
the ambassador case as well as I did.

231
00:21:04,805 --> 00:21:07,307
You didn't do it alone.

232
00:21:07,766 --> 00:21:10,852
You'd be an idiot not to succeed
after everything was set up for you.

233
00:21:10,936 --> 00:21:14,731
I was the one who set everything up.
The others just handcuffed him.

234
00:21:14,982 --> 00:21:17,859
Anyway, I'm booking my flight home.

235
00:21:17,943 --> 00:21:22,155
Stay put, unless you want
to be disciplined for leaving your post.

236
00:21:23,448 --> 00:21:24,283
Hello?

237
00:21:24,491 --> 00:21:26,326
Sir? Chief--

238
00:21:32,791 --> 00:21:33,709
Do you believe me now?

239
00:21:59,735 --> 00:22:02,904
Let's call it even,
although I got the short end of the stick.

240
00:22:39,816 --> 00:22:41,151
Why did you come here?

241
00:22:41,443 --> 00:22:43,862
You must have a reason
for coming here so late at night.

242
00:22:48,325 --> 00:22:51,328
Here's a video
that was taken before the crash.

243
00:22:52,454 --> 00:22:55,499
Watch it and try to remember the bastard.
You said you were smart.

244
00:22:56,958 --> 00:22:58,585
Look, Mr. Cha Dal-geon...

245
00:22:59,169 --> 00:23:02,381
I'm a busy person,
and I don't owe you anything.

246
00:23:02,464 --> 00:23:04,132
You're responsible too!

247
00:23:05,133 --> 00:23:06,176
What do you mean?

248
00:23:08,929 --> 00:23:10,055
Here, look.

249
00:23:11,348 --> 00:23:13,725
Look at your fancy name, right here!

250
00:23:13,809 --> 00:23:14,643
ORGANIZERS: GO HAE-RI, IM CHUN-SEO

251
00:23:21,483 --> 00:23:23,902
This just means that
I was one of the organizers.

252
00:23:23,985 --> 00:23:24,986
Exactly!

253
00:23:28,782 --> 00:23:29,825
I need your help.

254
00:23:31,910 --> 00:23:32,869
I'm begging you.

255
00:24:56,328 --> 00:24:58,246
Stay seated.

256
00:25:22,521 --> 00:25:24,606
You're responsible too!

257
00:25:27,651 --> 00:25:29,152
Asshole.

258
00:25:30,820 --> 00:25:32,447
Talking gibberish like that.

259
00:25:51,925 --> 00:25:55,428
I know you threw away your books.
You got busted.

260
00:25:56,471 --> 00:25:58,348
I brought them back home.

261
00:25:59,432 --> 00:26:00,850
They were so heavy.

262
00:26:03,228 --> 00:26:05,355
Why did you quit the Action Center?

263
00:26:18,577 --> 00:26:19,578
Hae-ri Go!

264
00:26:20,453 --> 00:26:22,497
I heard you scored big this time.

265
00:26:22,789 --> 00:26:24,249
Hwa-suk, where are you?

266
00:26:24,332 --> 00:26:26,126
At the office. Where else?

267
00:26:26,209 --> 00:26:29,796
I sent a video to your personal email.
I want you to check it.

268
00:26:29,879 --> 00:26:31,214
What video?

269
00:26:32,632 --> 00:26:34,217
Is it X-rated?

270
00:26:36,344 --> 00:26:37,512
CHECK THIS AUDIO PLEASE

271
00:26:40,765 --> 00:26:41,600
What is this?

272
00:26:42,267 --> 00:26:43,560
Open it.

273
00:26:50,275 --> 00:26:51,151
Oh, wow.

274
00:26:52,152 --> 00:26:54,029
Isn't this from the plane--?

275
00:26:54,362 --> 00:26:57,032
Can you see a guy on the phone
behind the kids?

276
00:26:57,365 --> 00:26:58,783
The one in a hoodie.

277
00:26:59,075 --> 00:27:00,660
Can you find out what he's saying?

278
00:27:02,912 --> 00:27:04,581
Why did you quit the Action Center?

279
00:27:05,457 --> 00:27:07,667
You said you were going to become
a famous martial arts director

280
00:27:07,751 --> 00:27:09,377
and go to Hollywood.

281
00:27:09,461 --> 00:27:12,005
It'll take a while to get this approved.

282
00:27:12,297 --> 00:27:15,550
There's no time.
Just make sure they can't find the email.

283
00:27:16,760 --> 00:27:18,136
Okay, fine.

284
00:27:18,219 --> 00:27:21,640
You should be spending your energy
on good-looking guys over there--

285
00:27:21,723 --> 00:27:22,932
This call is expensive.

286
00:27:23,224 --> 00:27:24,976
I've got to go. Thank you.

287
00:27:26,019 --> 00:27:26,895
Hello?

288
00:27:28,229 --> 00:27:29,356
You're not welcome.

289
00:27:36,988 --> 00:27:38,239

Hello, Mr. Prime Minister.

292
00:27:54,673 --> 00:27:57,550
-Great press briefing this morning.
-Thank you.

293
00:27:58,134 --> 00:27:59,844
-Where's the president?
-In his office.

294
00:28:00,762 --> 00:28:02,389
He's in a bad mood.

295
00:28:03,807 --> 00:28:04,641
Okay.

296
00:28:06,101 --> 00:28:07,477
F-X COMPANY EVALUATION REPORT
MINISTRY OF NATIONAL DEFENSE

297
00:28:09,145 --> 00:28:11,523
JEONG GOOK-PYO
PRESIDENT OF KOREA

298
00:28:13,900 --> 00:28:15,860
THE MOST PROMISING MODEL IS THE F70.

299
00:28:22,450 --> 00:28:24,619
I can wait outside if you're busy.

300
00:28:24,911 --> 00:28:26,496
It's okay. Take a seat.

301
00:28:35,672 --> 00:28:37,173
HONG SUN-JO
PRIME MINISTER OF KOREA

302
00:28:37,257 --> 00:28:38,633
When considering not only the price,

303
00:28:38,717 --> 00:28:40,635
but also the performance and technology...

304
00:28:40,719 --> 00:28:41,928
PARK MAN-YEONG
MINISTER OF NATIONAL DEFENSE

305
00:28:42,011 --> 00:28:44,681
...Dynamic's F70 is a better choice
than John & Mark's product.

306
00:28:45,098 --> 00:28:46,891
What about public opinion?

307
00:28:46,975 --> 00:28:48,309
YUN HAN-GI - SENIOR SECRETARY
TO THE PRESIDENT FOR CIVIL AFFAIRS

308
00:28:48,393 --> 00:28:50,645
Are you sure
you can handle public opposition

309
00:28:50,729 --> 00:28:52,731
to a deal with Dynamic System?

310
00:28:52,814 --> 00:28:55,775
Still, we can't rush into a decision
with such a long-term effect.

311
00:28:56,151 --> 00:28:59,946
The president's approval rating
has plummeted since the crash.

312
00:29:00,029 --> 00:29:01,990
Are you trying to make things worse?

313
00:29:02,073 --> 00:29:04,075
That's the reason I'm saying this.

314
00:29:04,409 --> 00:29:07,120
If word gets out
that we wasted over one trillion won--

315
00:29:11,082 --> 00:29:12,667
Are you seriously bickering
in front of me?

316
00:29:18,298 --> 00:29:19,132
Minister Park...

317
00:29:20,216 --> 00:29:22,635
think about it this way.

318
00:29:22,969 --> 00:29:27,974
We're going to be investing at least
11 trillion won in the F-X project.

319
00:29:28,057 --> 00:29:30,518
And where did that money come from?

320
00:29:31,436 --> 00:29:34,022
Taxes, a result
of our citizens' hard work.

321
00:29:34,314 --> 00:29:39,736
But what would you do if that money
just causes our citizens more pain?

322
00:29:39,819 --> 00:29:42,405
Our national defense is important.

323
00:29:42,489 --> 00:29:44,908
And long-term plans are important too.

324
00:29:45,408 --> 00:29:48,328
But we're doing all this
to ensure the citizens' happiness.

325
00:29:48,912 --> 00:29:52,332
I'm just representing
the Ministry of National Defense.

326
00:29:52,415 --> 00:29:58,129
Please think long and hard about which
decision would truly benefit our country.

327
00:30:01,132 --> 00:30:02,133
All right.

328
00:30:03,384 --> 00:30:06,596
I'll consider all our options carefully.
You may leave now.

329
00:30:24,030 --> 00:30:27,242
How dare that bastard try to lecture me.

330
00:30:28,243 --> 00:30:32,497
You sure chose an interesting person
as the Minister of Defense.

331
00:30:32,747 --> 00:30:34,123
Are you mocking me?

332
00:30:34,415 --> 00:30:37,126
I told you when you appointed him

333
00:30:37,210 --> 00:30:41,673
that there are plenty of upright soldiers,
but few trustworthy ones.

334
00:30:42,674 --> 00:30:43,925
Don't you remember?

335
00:30:44,133 --> 00:30:48,012
How can I convince that bullheaded man
to side with me?

336
00:30:48,096 --> 00:30:50,223
You cannot change people.

337
00:30:50,974 --> 00:30:52,350
It's easier to fire them.

338
00:30:52,433 --> 00:30:54,143
You think I don't know that?

339
00:30:54,602 --> 00:30:56,729
But the timing would be bad.

340
00:30:56,813 --> 00:31:00,108
You're not usually one to wait
for the right timing.

341
00:31:01,860 --> 00:31:03,236
What a headache.

342
00:31:03,736 --> 00:31:05,572
Let's play Go.

343
00:31:09,033 --> 00:31:12,245
The families are having
a memorial service in Morocco today.

344
00:31:12,871 --> 00:31:13,705
So what?

345
00:31:15,415 --> 00:31:18,084
What's that got to do with us playing Go?

346
00:31:19,711 --> 00:31:21,796
Nothing. I'm just letting you know.

347
00:31:22,422 --> 00:31:25,425
You have to use the black stones today
since you lost last time.

348
00:31:25,633 --> 00:31:28,094
I can do whatever I want
while I'm in the Blue House.

349
00:31:31,556 --> 00:31:35,602
I should report you to the FTC
for abusing your power.

350
00:31:36,227 --> 00:31:38,271
You'll have to use the black stones
next time if you lose today.

351
00:31:44,611 --> 00:31:45,486
Mom...

352
00:31:45,987 --> 00:31:47,155
Jin-ho.

353
00:32:04,631 --> 00:32:08,760
You can't rest in peace,
and I can't even hold you!

354
00:32:09,302 --> 00:32:13,181
I miss you so much, my love!
I can't believe you're gone!

355
00:32:14,891 --> 00:32:17,018
My son, Daddy is sorry!

356
00:32:17,602 --> 00:32:19,103
Honey, please!

357
00:32:19,812 --> 00:32:22,190
I'm begging you, honey!

358
00:32:27,695 --> 00:32:29,364
Jin-ho!

359
00:32:31,449 --> 00:32:33,493
Honey!

360
00:33:14,409 --> 00:33:15,284
Hoon!

361
00:33:18,246 --> 00:33:19,455
Hoon, I'm sorry!

362
00:33:22,709 --> 00:33:23,626
Hoon!

363
00:33:42,979 --> 00:33:43,813
Hoon!

364
00:33:59,537 --> 00:34:05,043
The citizens of Korea are all saddened
and shocked by the crash of Flight B357.

365
00:34:05,126 --> 00:34:07,420
Some even argue that Dynamic System,

366
00:34:07,628 --> 00:34:10,923
the manufacturer,
shouldn't participate in the bidding.

367
00:34:11,007 --> 00:34:12,800
What do you say about this?

368
00:34:23,811 --> 00:34:27,065
The flight software
is like the brain of a plane,

369
00:34:27,440 --> 00:34:29,525
and engines are like the heart.

370
00:34:29,776 --> 00:34:33,946
The B357 manufactured by Dynamic System

371
00:34:34,030 --> 00:34:35,907
had a software failure,

372
00:34:36,282 --> 00:34:38,201
and its engine exploded.

373
00:34:38,284 --> 00:34:41,162
A soldier with a malfunctioning
head and heart

374
00:34:41,245 --> 00:34:43,831
can't win any battles.

375
00:34:44,123 --> 00:34:45,541
That's all I can say for now.

376
00:34:55,968 --> 00:34:57,178
Hey, Chief Gang.

377
00:34:57,804 --> 00:34:59,138
What a surprise.

378
00:34:59,680 --> 00:35:00,807
What are you doing here?

379
00:35:01,265 --> 00:35:03,142
You're a bit too old
to be playing with planes.

380
00:35:03,392 --> 00:35:05,353
And are you here because
you were playing with planes?

381
00:35:05,436 --> 00:35:08,231
Why are you being so hostile?

382
00:35:08,940 --> 00:35:11,275
Oh, is it because of the transfer order?

383
00:35:12,527 --> 00:35:16,072
What's wrong with
the Psychological Intelligence Department?

384
00:35:16,155 --> 00:35:19,867
Just keep an eye on the press
and make sure there are no typos.

385
00:35:19,951 --> 00:35:21,536
Go away. I'm annoyed enough as it is.

386
00:35:23,246 --> 00:35:25,498
Man, you reek of alcohol.

387
00:35:26,541 --> 00:35:27,959
Drinking during the day again?

388
00:35:28,501 --> 00:35:33,464
This is why the boss hates you,
because you're a disgrace to the NIS.

389
00:35:33,548 --> 00:35:35,341
Get the hell out of here.

390
00:35:36,008 --> 00:35:39,178
I'm just telling you this as your friend.

391
00:35:39,262 --> 00:35:42,265
How can I give you advice
when you're not ready to listen?

392
00:35:43,182 --> 00:35:45,726
Don't be so ma-- Oh, Senior Secretary Yun?

393
00:35:47,145 --> 00:35:50,148
I went to our hometown last week
for an alumni reunion.

394
00:35:50,231 --> 00:35:53,151
You were as popular as an idol star there.

395
00:35:53,234 --> 00:35:55,194
It's because you're the first
from our tiny town

396
00:35:55,278 --> 00:35:57,572
to become Senior Secretary
to the President for Civil Affairs.

397
00:35:57,947 --> 00:36:00,324
Have you had dinner yet?
Would you like to get some sushi?

398
00:36:00,950 --> 00:36:04,203
There's a place nearby
that specializes in wild-caught fish.

399
00:36:04,287 --> 00:36:06,038
Their food is top-notch. Let's go.

400
00:36:08,291 --> 00:36:10,168
GO HAE-RI

401
00:36:11,335 --> 00:36:13,171
Why do you want to see
the flight recorder?

402
00:36:13,546 --> 00:36:15,923
I'll tell you if you promise
not to get mad.

403
00:36:16,174 --> 00:36:17,425
Don't tell me. I'll get mad anyway.

404
00:36:17,508 --> 00:36:18,593
I've heard that...

405
00:36:20,052 --> 00:36:22,805
someone survived the plane crash.

406
00:36:23,097 --> 00:36:23,973
What?

407
00:36:25,725 --> 00:36:28,186
Go tell that nonsense to Chief Min.

408
00:36:28,269 --> 00:36:30,396
Why call me and not your boss?

409
00:36:30,730 --> 00:36:34,025
You said you knew someone at the ICAO.

410
00:36:34,108 --> 00:36:37,320
-I'm going to hang up now.
-Don't do this to me, sir.

411
00:36:37,403 --> 00:36:40,656
I went to Lisbon for you.

412
00:36:41,240 --> 00:36:43,618
I got drenched out there. It was torture.

413
00:36:44,535 --> 00:36:46,913
One good turn deserves another.

414
00:36:46,996 --> 00:36:49,415
Don't be so cold.

415
00:36:49,749 --> 00:36:50,666
All right.

416
00:36:52,668 --> 00:36:54,837
I'll see what I can do,
but don't get your hopes up.

417
00:36:55,838 --> 00:36:56,756
Thank you, sir.

418
00:36:58,299 --> 00:37:01,427
By the way,
did you get the autopsy results?

419
00:37:02,470 --> 00:37:03,888
He killed himself, right?

420
00:37:04,472 --> 00:37:05,806
Something's not right.

421
00:37:06,140 --> 00:37:08,476
He wasn't the suicidal type at all.

422
00:37:09,727 --> 00:37:10,770
I've got to go.

423
00:37:12,438 --> 00:37:13,898
Excuse me.

424
00:37:16,025 --> 00:37:18,277
My name is Gang Ju-cheol.
I called you earlier.

425
00:37:19,028 --> 00:37:21,113
Oh, yes. Nice to meet you.

426
00:37:21,656 --> 00:37:23,866
You're a friend of Michael's, right?

427
00:37:23,950 --> 00:37:24,825
That's right.

428
00:37:25,826 --> 00:37:28,537
I have a couple of things
I need to ask you about him.

429
00:37:29,288 --> 00:37:31,916
I can only spare five minutes
due to my tight schedule.

430
00:37:33,000 --> 00:37:36,170
Michael's wife
hasn't been answering her phone.

431
00:37:37,880 --> 00:37:40,591
Do you know why he killed himself?

432
00:37:43,052 --> 00:37:45,221
It's not something I can share with you.

433
00:37:45,846 --> 00:37:48,557
How well did you know Michael?

434
00:37:48,849 --> 00:37:51,769
He helped me out a lot
when he was with the CIA.

435
00:37:54,605 --> 00:37:55,731
Michael...

436
00:37:57,149 --> 00:37:59,026
was involved with quite a few women.

437
00:37:59,694 --> 00:38:02,446
Do you know exactly how
he was involved, and with whom?

438
00:38:03,281 --> 00:38:06,033
That's private, so I can't tell you
any more than that.

439
00:38:06,617 --> 00:38:07,535
I'm sorry.

440
00:38:19,463 --> 00:38:21,674
This will help you
with your motion sickness.

441
00:38:22,091 --> 00:38:22,925
Thank you.

442
00:38:25,011 --> 00:38:26,429
You said you had an upset stomach?

443
00:38:26,679 --> 00:38:29,598
These pills I take are really effective.

444
00:38:29,682 --> 00:38:33,144
Take one now, and take another one later
if you still feel ill on the plane.

445
00:38:33,227 --> 00:38:34,437
Thank you for everything.

446
00:38:35,104 --> 00:38:36,105
Is everyone here?

447
00:38:39,734 --> 00:38:41,610
I don't see Mr. Cha Dal-geon.

448
00:38:41,694 --> 00:38:43,821
He decided to stay here
to catch the terrorist.

449
00:38:45,114 --> 00:38:46,365
He went back to the hotel.

450
00:38:46,949 --> 00:38:47,950
It's time to go.

451
00:38:48,993 --> 00:38:49,994
Thank you for your hard work.

452
00:38:52,955 --> 00:38:54,874
-Thank you.
-Goodbye, sir.

453
00:38:56,083 --> 00:38:57,168
This way, please.

454
00:39:07,803 --> 00:39:08,763
O-chan, it's me.

455
00:39:09,096 --> 00:39:12,016
I'm sending you a video.
Upload it to every site you can think of.

456
00:39:15,561 --> 00:39:16,479
What the...?

457
00:39:25,946 --> 00:39:26,947
Mr. Cha Dal-geon!

458
00:39:28,157 --> 00:39:30,284
What is it? What's wrong?

459
00:39:30,368 --> 00:39:32,620
The videos Hoon uploaded
to the cloud are all gone!

460
00:39:32,703 --> 00:39:33,537
What?

461
00:39:33,788 --> 00:39:35,289
Maybe they were accidentally deleted?

462
00:39:44,590 --> 00:39:46,175
-What the...?
-Shit.

463
00:39:52,098 --> 00:39:52,973
Dal-geon!

464
00:39:56,977 --> 00:39:57,812
No!

465
00:40:31,762 --> 00:40:32,596
Stop right there!

466
00:41:04,920 --> 00:41:06,338
Get over here!

467
00:41:08,924 --> 00:41:10,676
Who sent you? Tell me!

468
00:41:12,094 --> 00:41:13,095
Why are you doing this?

469
00:41:13,596 --> 00:41:15,598
I don't know anything!

470
00:41:17,141 --> 00:41:18,392
Let me live! I don't know anything!

471
00:41:18,476 --> 00:41:19,310
Plane!

472
00:41:21,061 --> 00:41:23,772
-Let me live! I don't know anything!
-What the hell are you saying?

473
00:41:23,856 --> 00:41:24,857
Get over here, damn it.

474
00:41:25,649 --> 00:41:27,234
Tell me now!

475
00:41:27,693 --> 00:41:29,862
I said speak English, you bastard!

476
00:41:29,945 --> 00:41:33,157
Hurry up and tell me
if you don't want to die!

477
00:41:33,991 --> 00:41:35,451
Tell me if you don't want to die!

478
00:41:36,827 --> 00:41:38,871
-Freeze!
-Let him go!

479
00:41:42,333 --> 00:41:43,876
Let go of me!

480
00:41:44,752 --> 00:41:47,046
Not me! Arrest him, you idiots!

481
00:41:47,338 --> 00:41:49,465
Arrest him, not me!

482
00:41:49,757 --> 00:41:50,591
Let me go!

483
00:41:56,889 --> 00:41:58,349
Can you hear anything?

484
00:41:58,432 --> 00:41:59,433
Give me a second.

485
00:42:01,810 --> 00:42:03,354
You got busted.

486
00:42:04,772 --> 00:42:06,440
-The person next to...
-I brought them back home.

487
00:42:10,027 --> 00:42:11,946
-The person next to...
-I brought them back home.

488
00:42:15,115 --> 00:42:17,076
-The person next to...
-I brought them back home.

489
00:42:18,118 --> 00:42:19,495
I can hear a bit...

490
00:42:21,163 --> 00:42:23,040
-The person next to...
-I brought them back home.

491
00:42:23,123 --> 00:42:24,833
I don't think he's speaking Korean.

492
00:42:25,709 --> 00:42:27,795
-Excuse me?
-I think it's Spanish.

493
00:42:28,379 --> 00:42:30,297
-Give me that.
-Sure.

494
00:42:34,134 --> 00:42:36,679
-Why did you quit the Action Center?
-Set your watch

495
00:42:36,762 --> 00:42:38,472
-to the current time, 11...
-You said you were going to become--

496
00:42:38,556 --> 00:42:40,182
-From the beginning.
-Okay.

497
00:42:40,599 --> 00:42:42,476
-The person next to...
-I brought them back home.

498
00:42:42,560 --> 00:42:43,435
Okay?

499
00:42:43,936 --> 00:42:47,231
-Why did you quit the Action Center?
-Set your watch...

500
00:42:47,314 --> 00:42:48,732
You said you were going to become
a famous martial arts director

501
00:42:49,233 --> 00:42:50,776
-and go to Hollywood.
-Seven...

502
00:42:50,859 --> 00:42:53,904
-Are we authorized to do--?
-Shush. Hold on.

503
00:42:55,364 --> 00:43:00,494
-Exactly 14 hours and 37 minutes from now.
-...when you're doing stunts.

504
00:43:00,578 --> 00:43:02,454
-I'm sorry I got mad at you...
-And the gift?

505
00:43:10,462 --> 00:43:11,672
Hello?

506
00:43:12,131 --> 00:43:13,966
I found out what he was saying
on the phone.

507
00:43:17,386 --> 00:43:20,514
-What did he say?
-I couldn't understand anything.

508
00:43:20,598 --> 00:43:24,476
The man in the video was speaking Spanish.

509
00:43:25,686 --> 00:43:26,520
Spanish?

510
00:43:27,104 --> 00:43:28,939
I'll read it to you. Write it down.

511
00:43:32,610 --> 00:43:34,737
Can you text it to me? Thanks.

512
00:43:36,530 --> 00:43:38,657
She's such a pain in the neck.

513
00:43:43,370 --> 00:43:45,539
-Who is it?
-It's me.

514
00:43:48,667 --> 00:43:50,294
What are you doing here so early?

515
00:43:50,377 --> 00:43:53,088
Cha Dal-geon is in police custody.

516
00:43:53,422 --> 00:43:54,298
What?

517
00:43:56,091 --> 00:43:57,301
What did he do this time?

518
00:43:59,136 --> 00:44:01,722
-Just follow me.
-I know the way.

519
00:44:01,805 --> 00:44:04,141
-Okay. Drive safely.
-Thank you.

520
00:45:48,454 --> 00:45:50,748
Hoon hasn't said a single word
in the past two months.

521
00:45:50,998 --> 00:45:52,291
The doctor said that

522
00:45:52,374 --> 00:45:55,002
it's not that he can't speak,
it's just that he won't.

523
00:45:55,085 --> 00:45:56,712
You couldn't reach his mom?

524
00:45:57,588 --> 00:45:59,423
No, that's why we called you.

525
00:46:02,050 --> 00:46:04,928
So... what you're saying is,
you want me to take him?

526
00:46:05,262 --> 00:46:07,931
-You're his family.
-Family, my ass.

527
00:46:13,479 --> 00:46:14,438
I can't.

528
00:46:14,897 --> 00:46:16,982
My life is hard enough.
I can't raise a kid.

529
00:46:17,316 --> 00:46:20,194
-We're closing down soon.
-Find another orphanage...

530
00:46:23,822 --> 00:46:25,908
Find another orphanage for him, then.

531
00:46:26,992 --> 00:46:28,160
Do it yourself.

532
00:46:29,495 --> 00:46:30,996
Hey. Hey!

533
00:46:32,873 --> 00:46:33,707
Shit.

534
00:46:41,465 --> 00:46:42,466
Lift up your arm.

535
00:46:45,886 --> 00:46:47,221
Don't you miss your mom?

536
00:46:47,971 --> 00:46:50,933
I'll find her soon,
and then you can stay with her.

537
00:46:51,892 --> 00:46:53,852
My mom abandoned me.

538
00:46:57,564 --> 00:46:59,483
Will you abandon me too, uncle?

539
00:47:01,068 --> 00:47:02,069
Looks like you can talk just fine.

540
00:47:03,153 --> 00:47:04,988
If you're going to abandon me,
then do it now.

541
00:47:06,365 --> 00:47:09,493
Family isn't like a piece of junk
that you can throw away.

542
00:47:12,746 --> 00:47:13,747
Family is...

543
00:47:18,043 --> 00:47:19,586
people living under the same roof.

544
00:47:20,420 --> 00:47:21,755
Family, my ass!

545
00:47:21,964 --> 00:47:24,049
Look at you, learning the bad words first.

546
00:47:26,385 --> 00:47:28,887
Who taught you such a bad word?

547
00:47:29,471 --> 00:47:32,307
-Stop it.
-Why you...

548
00:47:32,391 --> 00:47:34,309
You want to fight with me?

549
00:47:34,393 --> 00:47:37,855
You want to fight?
Oh, okay. I won't let you!

550
00:47:37,938 --> 00:47:39,022
Okay, you win.

551
00:47:39,106 --> 00:47:41,692
I surrender, I surrender!

552
00:47:43,318 --> 00:47:45,654
Got you.

553
00:48:18,145 --> 00:48:19,104
Come.

554
00:48:41,501 --> 00:48:43,337
We will now begin the interrogation.

555
00:48:45,464 --> 00:48:46,882
Was anything else stolen
besides the laptop?

556
00:48:47,215 --> 00:48:51,053
Tell them he's working with the man
who crashed the plane.

557
00:48:52,554 --> 00:48:54,431
I don't think that's a good idea.

558
00:48:54,681 --> 00:48:55,641
Just tell them.

559
00:48:59,978 --> 00:49:01,897
The man who crashed the plane
and this man are working together.

560
00:49:11,073 --> 00:49:12,032
He went to clean your room,

561
00:49:12,115 --> 00:49:14,201
but it was in a mess,
so he went to report it to the front desk.

562
00:49:14,660 --> 00:49:16,703
Don't lie, you son of a bitch!

563
00:49:22,334 --> 00:49:25,253
He said you suddenly started to hit him.

564
00:49:26,213 --> 00:49:28,256
You bastard!

565
00:49:29,132 --> 00:49:30,884
Damn it! You damn bastard!

566
00:49:30,968 --> 00:49:33,762
Dal-geon, you'll just make it worse
if you get worked up.

567
00:49:41,311 --> 00:49:44,481
This man is a cleaner at the hotel,
and they've checked his identity.

568
00:49:45,399 --> 00:49:46,900
Then the hotel
must be working with them too.

569
00:49:48,986 --> 00:49:49,987
Mr. Cha Dal-geon...

570
00:49:50,070 --> 00:49:51,321
Translate it, now!

571
00:49:53,198 --> 00:49:55,367
I can't. You do it.

572
00:49:56,284 --> 00:49:57,202
Damn it.

573
00:49:58,787 --> 00:50:02,499
Let the cleaner go,
and put this guy back in the cell.

574
00:50:04,459 --> 00:50:07,129
Thank you so much
for believing me, detective. Thank you.

575
00:50:08,672 --> 00:50:11,174
-Why are they uncuffing him?
-It's because--

576
00:50:11,258 --> 00:50:14,136
He's being released,
and you're going back to jail.

577
00:50:14,219 --> 00:50:16,346
What are you talking about? No!

578
00:50:18,432 --> 00:50:19,558
Shit.

579
00:50:20,809 --> 00:50:22,394
Let me go!

580
00:50:23,645 --> 00:50:25,230
Dal-geon! Hey!

581
00:50:29,484 --> 00:50:30,569
What are you doing?

582
00:50:30,944 --> 00:50:32,195
Tell that bastard

583
00:50:32,279 --> 00:50:33,655
that I'm an 18th-degree black belt.

584
00:50:33,739 --> 00:50:35,532
It won't take me a second to kill him!

585
00:50:35,866 --> 00:50:39,745
Hurry up and admit
that you're working with that terrorist!

586
00:50:39,828 --> 00:50:43,290
That's enough, Mr. Cha Dal-geon.
Do you want to rot in jail forever?

587
00:50:43,957 --> 00:50:46,251
She's right. This is not the way.

588
00:50:50,380 --> 00:50:53,175
He'll shoot you if you don't release him
on the count of three!

589
00:50:54,384 --> 00:50:56,887
Still not talking?
Let's die together, then.

590
00:50:59,264 --> 00:51:00,807
These people will shoot you!

591
00:51:01,141 --> 00:51:02,476
Admit it!

592
00:51:08,106 --> 00:51:09,024
Don't fire.

593
00:51:15,655 --> 00:51:16,573
He says...

594
00:51:17,407 --> 00:51:18,492
they'll shoot me too.

595
00:51:20,702 --> 00:51:23,538
You're gonna get me killed, asshole!

596
00:51:37,928 --> 00:51:38,970
Damn it!

597
00:52:18,969 --> 00:52:20,053
Yes, chief.

598
00:52:20,554 --> 00:52:24,683
Go to the ICAO office
and ask for Dr. Kevin Kim.

599
00:52:24,766 --> 00:52:26,226
He'll show you the flight recorder.

600
00:52:26,810 --> 00:52:29,855
He's a Korean-American
who's been working with us.

601
00:52:32,649 --> 00:52:33,650
Are you there?

602
00:52:33,984 --> 00:52:36,903
I don't think
I'll need to check it after all.

603
00:52:37,863 --> 00:52:40,240
You sent me on a wild-goose chase?

604
00:52:40,782 --> 00:52:41,783
I'm sorry, sir.

605
00:53:07,684 --> 00:53:10,103
I don't have time to lose.
Get me out of here.

606
00:53:10,604 --> 00:53:14,149
I did everything I could.
I won't help you anymore.

607
00:53:14,232 --> 00:53:16,193
What if I've been telling you the truth?

608
00:53:16,902 --> 00:53:20,739
Then you'll be the terrorist's accomplice.

609
00:53:22,449 --> 00:53:24,451
Shit. He's driving me crazy.

610
00:54:05,242 --> 00:54:06,159
Welcome.

611
00:54:09,663 --> 00:54:12,540
-I'm Go Hae-ri.
-Yes, I know. I'm Kevin Kim.

612
00:54:17,837 --> 00:54:21,049
We retrieved two flight recorders
from the plane.

613
00:54:23,969 --> 00:54:26,888
One has audio recordings from the cockpit,

614
00:54:27,347 --> 00:54:29,975
and the other has the records
of the software data.

615
00:54:37,524 --> 00:54:39,651
What's up with all those kids?

616
00:54:39,734 --> 00:54:41,569
It's a taekwondo demo team.

617
00:54:41,653 --> 00:54:43,405
Oh, a national team?

618
00:54:43,947 --> 00:54:45,657
We'll have to take good care of them.

619
00:54:48,034 --> 00:54:49,661
-May I take this call?
-Sure.

620
00:54:50,578 --> 00:54:54,332
Hi, honey. I was waiting for your call.

621
00:54:54,416 --> 00:54:56,710
Wow, you speak Spanish as well?

622
00:54:56,918 --> 00:54:59,921
Don't worry, he doesn't understand
what we're saying.

623
00:55:00,005 --> 00:55:01,840
Doctor, do you speak Spanish?

624
00:55:02,799 --> 00:55:04,050
I had it translated.

625
00:55:09,514 --> 00:55:11,891
He seems to be talking to his girlfriend.

626
00:55:12,142 --> 00:55:14,185
Okay, hold on.

627
00:55:14,769 --> 00:55:17,689
I've synchronized my watch.

628
00:55:19,858 --> 00:55:24,029
The man in the video was speaking Spanish.

629
00:56:05,195 --> 00:56:08,656
Hi, honey. I was waiting for your call.

630
00:56:09,908 --> 00:56:13,411
Don't worry, he doesn't understand
what we're saying.

631
00:56:14,079 --> 00:56:16,956
-Why did you quit the Action Center?
-Set your watch

632
00:56:17,040 --> 00:56:22,587
to the current time, 11:02 a.m.
Seven, eight, nine seconds.

633
00:56:23,046 --> 00:56:26,591
Okay, hold on. It's done.

634
00:56:27,467 --> 00:56:29,135
What time should we meet?

635
00:56:29,219 --> 00:56:33,932
Exactly 14 hours and 37 minutes from now.

636
00:56:34,432 --> 00:56:37,268
-And the gift?
-I've made all the preparations.

637
00:56:37,644 --> 00:56:39,354
You'll find it at the meeting point.

638
00:56:39,437 --> 00:56:41,189
What about our date plans, my love?

639
00:56:42,774 --> 00:56:45,527
They are set for 13:15, 13:20,

640
00:56:46,277 --> 00:56:47,612
13:23,

641
00:56:48,113 --> 00:56:49,322
13:30.

642
00:56:49,572 --> 00:56:50,490
All right.

643
00:56:51,116 --> 00:56:52,200
Do you need anything else?

644
00:56:52,492 --> 00:56:53,993
No, it's fine.

645
00:56:54,202 --> 00:56:56,621
I love you, darling.

646
00:57:02,043 --> 00:57:04,129
It seems like
they were talking to each other.

647
00:57:05,547 --> 00:57:06,381
Yes, it does.

648
00:57:06,673 --> 00:57:09,717
But if one of them is the co-pilot...

649
00:57:10,635 --> 00:57:12,053
then who's the other one?

650
00:57:27,110 --> 00:57:28,236
You are free to go.

651
00:57:38,663 --> 00:57:41,666
-What's going on?
-I spent 1,500 euros.

652
00:57:41,749 --> 00:57:44,127
I could've gotten it down to 1,000.

653
00:57:46,754 --> 00:57:49,966
-You bribed them?
-What else could I do?

654
00:57:51,843 --> 00:57:56,347
This is my bank account number,
so wire 1,500 euros to me.

655
00:58:00,101 --> 00:58:01,394
You'd better do it.

656
00:58:03,980 --> 00:58:05,398
That idiot was right.

657
00:58:06,232 --> 00:58:07,108
Excuse me?

658
00:58:09,277 --> 00:58:10,653
The B357 crash was...

659
00:58:14,282 --> 00:58:15,575
an act of terrorism.

660
00:58:20,622 --> 00:58:22,749
Why do you want to join the NIS?

661
00:58:27,795 --> 00:58:30,465
My father was a colonel
in the Marine Corps.

662
00:58:31,049 --> 00:58:32,842
A fire broke out
during a training exercise,

663
00:58:33,134 --> 00:58:35,929
and he died saving eight of his men.

664
00:58:37,388 --> 00:58:40,767
I want to follow in his noble footsteps
and serve my country--

665
00:58:40,850 --> 00:58:41,768
Boring.

666
00:58:44,395 --> 00:58:45,230
Excuse me?

667
00:58:45,688 --> 00:58:48,399
Most applicants give me the same answer.

668
00:58:53,321 --> 00:58:56,199
I'm the daughter of a national hero.

669
00:58:56,449 --> 00:59:00,411
Doubting my patriotism
is an insult to my father--

670
00:59:00,495 --> 00:59:02,038
He was worried about you.

671
00:59:03,540 --> 00:59:07,001
Colonel Go Gang-cheol,
chief of Division One of the Marine Corps.

672
00:59:08,503 --> 00:59:10,672
Did you know my father personally?

673
00:59:11,214 --> 00:59:14,634
I'm one of the eight people
that the colonel saved.

674
00:59:17,512 --> 00:59:19,347
Oh, I see.

675
00:59:19,931 --> 00:59:21,516
What a coincidence.

676
00:59:26,938 --> 00:59:29,857
I wasn't going to bring this up...

677
00:59:32,235 --> 00:59:37,574
but my mom got scammed recently
while trying to buy a shopping complex.

678
00:59:38,491 --> 00:59:41,452
And our house
is about to be auctioned off.

679
00:59:41,911 --> 00:59:44,872
And my brother failed
the college entrance exam, and decided--

680
00:59:44,956 --> 00:59:46,082
We're done here.

681
00:59:48,084 --> 00:59:49,794
I'm the sole earner for my family.

682
00:59:49,877 --> 00:59:51,629
You said my father saved your life.

683
00:59:51,713 --> 00:59:55,633
If I don't get this job,
my family will become homeless--

684
01:00:02,890 --> 01:00:03,808
