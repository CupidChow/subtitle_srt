1
00:01:19,996 --> 00:01:21,081
ROK-US ALLIANCE 59TH ANNIVERSARY

2
00:01:21,164 --> 00:01:22,332
HOSTED BY THE MINISTRY
OF NATIONAL DEFENSE

3
00:01:38,598 --> 00:01:40,642
It's been a while, Mr. Minister.

4
00:01:48,149 --> 00:01:52,195
It's so hard to get a hold of you.

5
00:01:52,904 --> 00:01:55,448
You must be busy
with the grieving families.

6
00:01:55,532 --> 00:01:59,786
Soon... they will sign the agreement,

7
00:02:00,745 --> 00:02:03,248
which will make your job a lot easier.

8
00:02:03,706 --> 00:02:06,042
Some of them plan to sue Dynamic System.

9
00:02:06,543 --> 00:02:10,755
That's why I'm being paid a high salary.
To put a stop to such things. Don't worry.

10
00:02:12,590 --> 00:02:14,467
Why would I worry about you people?

11
00:02:16,636 --> 00:02:18,263
People might misunderstand.

12
00:02:19,430 --> 00:02:21,015
Please watch what you say.

13
00:02:29,357 --> 00:02:30,859
It won't be easy this time.

14
00:02:32,152 --> 00:02:33,611
Even you...

15
00:02:34,612 --> 00:02:35,780
can't turn the tables.

16
00:02:37,907 --> 00:02:39,534
Nothing's been signed yet.

17
00:02:40,827 --> 00:02:42,203
Do you want to make a bet?

18
00:02:42,287 --> 00:02:46,166
I can bet everything I've got
on which agreement they'll sign.

19
00:02:47,292 --> 00:02:50,170
What did you do to Minister Park?

20
00:02:50,253 --> 00:02:53,673
I simply applied a tiny bit
of what I've learned from you.

21
00:02:53,756 --> 00:02:55,091
Didn't I teach you

22
00:02:55,800 --> 00:02:59,137
that you should never be certain
in this line of business?

23
00:03:00,513 --> 00:03:03,099
The plane isn't the only thing
that crashed.

24
00:03:03,183 --> 00:03:04,184
Haven't you realized?

25
00:03:04,475 --> 00:03:07,937
The reputation you've built
in this business

26
00:03:08,771 --> 00:03:10,356
has crashed as well.

27
00:03:12,567 --> 00:03:14,819
It's not too late
to forget about rebidding.

28
00:03:16,070 --> 00:03:18,281
You wouldn't want to be
any more humiliated.

29
00:03:22,785 --> 00:03:26,122
-Oh, General Bae!
-Oh, Jessica. Good to see you.

30
00:03:26,206 --> 00:03:28,708
-Likewise.
-I heard you struck a huge deal.

31
00:03:29,459 --> 00:03:30,752
It's the talk of the town.

32
00:03:34,339 --> 00:03:36,925
We just arrived. Where are you?

33
00:03:38,676 --> 00:03:39,844
Let's begin.

34
00:03:52,732 --> 00:03:55,735
-I'm sorry.
-You should watch where you're going.

35
00:04:15,129 --> 00:04:15,964
Who are you?

36
00:04:16,923 --> 00:04:18,716
Who the hell are you?!

37
00:04:19,592 --> 00:04:20,802
What's going on?

38
00:04:21,803 --> 00:04:23,263
Plan B, now.

39
00:04:24,555 --> 00:04:25,390
Open your fist.

40
00:04:27,267 --> 00:04:29,227
Open your fucking fist!

41
00:04:29,894 --> 00:04:31,646
-What's wrong with you?
-Don't move.

42
00:04:33,189 --> 00:04:34,232
What?

43
00:04:34,565 --> 00:04:35,692
Captain!

44
00:04:36,317 --> 00:04:37,777
It's almost time for take-off.

45
00:04:38,695 --> 00:04:40,863
-You need to get changed.
-Jeez.

46
00:04:42,991 --> 00:04:44,867
-Are you okay?
-I'm sorry.

47
00:04:44,951 --> 00:04:47,620
He's taking medication for his anxiety.

48
00:04:49,205 --> 00:04:50,039
You.

49
00:04:51,124 --> 00:04:52,292
Get out of there.

50
00:04:53,376 --> 00:04:55,169
-I'm sorry.
-Jeez.

51
00:05:03,886 --> 00:05:05,471
Please stop overreacting.

52
00:05:06,014 --> 00:05:08,599
You behaved the same way
at the airport in Morocco.

53
00:05:11,894 --> 00:05:12,895
Hae-ri Go!

54
00:05:13,521 --> 00:05:17,317
Oh, my gosh! How long has it been?

55
00:05:18,067 --> 00:05:21,404
Hey. You look like you've had a good time.

56
00:05:21,487 --> 00:05:22,488
Why you...

57
00:05:22,780 --> 00:05:25,158
Oh, my. Mr. Cha Dal-geon?

58
00:05:25,241 --> 00:05:29,037
Nice to meet you. I'm Gong Hwa-suk.
Hae-ri must've told you a lot about me.

59
00:05:29,120 --> 00:05:29,954
No, she hasn't.

60
00:05:30,538 --> 00:05:32,957
Oh, she hasn't. You are very direct.

61
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:36,002
You must be hungry.
What do you want for lunch?

62
00:05:36,085 --> 00:05:38,129
Kimchi stew with tons of pork.

63
00:05:38,588 --> 00:05:40,173
What about you, Dal-geon?

64
00:05:40,256 --> 00:05:41,215
I'm not hungry.

65
00:05:41,299 --> 00:05:43,176
"Not hungry"...

66
00:05:44,135 --> 00:05:45,470
Let's get to my car first.

67
00:05:45,845 --> 00:05:46,929
Let's go.

68
00:05:49,932 --> 00:05:53,978
What the hell happened in Morocco?
Tell me. I want to know.

69
00:05:54,437 --> 00:05:59,108
Where do I start?
I almost died and became a virgin ghost.

70
00:05:59,192 --> 00:06:02,695
Yeah, right. Take the word "virgin"
out of that sentence.

71
00:06:03,488 --> 00:06:04,405
Quiet!

72
00:06:12,205 --> 00:06:13,247
Nice plan.

73
00:06:14,082 --> 00:06:16,209
-Are you mocking me?
-Plan B.

74
00:06:17,001 --> 00:06:20,797
The target hasn't noticed yet.
You'll have another opportunity.

75
00:06:23,716 --> 00:06:25,134
He's a stuntman, right?

76
00:06:26,552 --> 00:06:29,764
What a nice little challenge he is.

77
00:06:34,852 --> 00:06:36,104
It's good. Eat up.

78
00:06:37,313 --> 00:06:39,857
-Did you bring what I asked for?
-What?

79
00:06:41,317 --> 00:06:42,193
Oh, that?

80
00:06:42,944 --> 00:06:44,529
It's so strange.

81
00:06:44,946 --> 00:06:48,074
There's no record
of their employment history,

82
00:06:48,157 --> 00:06:50,284
financial transactions, or call logs.

83
00:06:50,743 --> 00:06:51,661
What do you mean?

84
00:06:51,744 --> 00:06:55,623
What about Kim Ho-sik,
who died in Morocco, and the co-pilot?

85
00:06:55,706 --> 00:06:59,335
Yes, those two. There's nothing left
but their basic information.

86
00:07:01,587 --> 00:07:03,256
Is the NIS that incompetent?

87
00:07:03,339 --> 00:07:05,049
It's not that we can't...

88
00:07:05,675 --> 00:07:07,427
Never mind.

89
00:07:07,927 --> 00:07:10,847
Maybe someone got rid of the records
before we could get to them.

90
00:07:10,930 --> 00:07:13,182
That's what I was thinking.
We need to look into it.

91
00:07:16,477 --> 00:07:17,770
Let's eat first.

92
00:07:19,856 --> 00:07:22,316
What about the terrorist from the video?

93
00:07:22,400 --> 00:07:23,568
Actually...

94
00:07:24,277 --> 00:07:27,488
there's a slight problem,
so it's going to take a while.

95
00:07:27,572 --> 00:07:29,073
What? What problem?

96
00:07:30,283 --> 00:07:31,409
Hold on a second.

97
00:07:32,410 --> 00:07:34,078
Are you interrogating me?

98
00:07:37,540 --> 00:07:39,000
Does he always look this scary?

99
00:07:39,083 --> 00:07:40,501
You'll get used to it.

100
00:07:40,877 --> 00:07:41,836
Eat.

101
00:07:46,090 --> 00:07:48,009
HOON'S MOM

102
00:08:00,688 --> 00:08:03,858
-I am curious.
-About what?

103
00:08:03,941 --> 00:08:07,111
There must have been a reason
to crash the plane,

104
00:08:07,778 --> 00:08:10,239
but I can't think of any.

105
00:08:12,325 --> 00:08:16,954
I wasn't able to sleep for days
after I heard about what happened to Hoon.

106
00:08:18,498 --> 00:08:19,749
I can't believe it.

107
00:08:20,875 --> 00:08:23,920
Did you know that the families
are getting together tonight?

108
00:08:24,795 --> 00:08:29,008
If you don't want to go, I can go instead.

109
00:08:30,843 --> 00:08:32,178
Hello?

110
00:08:32,595 --> 00:08:33,554
I'm listening.

111
00:08:35,765 --> 00:08:38,267
They're meeting
to talk about compensation.

112
00:08:38,434 --> 00:08:40,853
Do you know anything about it?

113
00:08:42,939 --> 00:08:44,815
You said you weren't his mom anymore.

114
00:08:45,525 --> 00:08:46,734
Don't get me wrong.

115
00:08:47,193 --> 00:08:49,904
I'm not doing this because of the money.

116
00:08:49,987 --> 00:08:52,073
Do you know how much he missed you?

117
00:08:53,074 --> 00:08:55,701
You never visited him
after abandoning him at the orphanage,

118
00:08:56,244 --> 00:08:57,870
and now you're acting like his mom?

119
00:08:58,871 --> 00:08:59,956
Dal-geon.

120
00:09:01,541 --> 00:09:03,668
It's not my business where you go,

121
00:09:04,126 --> 00:09:05,962
but stay out of my sight.

122
00:09:07,129 --> 00:09:09,966
Otherwise, I might destroy
your precious house...

123
00:09:12,176 --> 00:09:13,886
which you love more than Hoon.

124
00:09:14,720 --> 00:09:15,555
Understood?

125
00:09:22,562 --> 00:09:23,688
Damn it.

126
00:09:27,900 --> 00:09:29,819
Mr. Cha Dal-geon?

127
00:09:31,737 --> 00:09:32,822
How do you do?

128
00:09:33,281 --> 00:09:36,200
I'm Jo Bu-yeong,
a reporter from Pyeonghwa Daily.

129
00:09:38,995 --> 00:09:40,580
-So?
-Well...

130
00:09:41,247 --> 00:09:43,457
while interviewing the grieving families,

131
00:09:44,250 --> 00:09:46,961
I was told that you claimed
the crash was caused by a terrorist.

132
00:09:48,629 --> 00:09:49,755
JO BU-YEONG

133
00:09:51,507 --> 00:09:52,341
What do you want?

134
00:09:56,053 --> 00:09:57,513
The day before the accident,

135
00:09:57,597 --> 00:10:00,641
the airport police got a call
about a terrorist attack.

136
00:10:03,227 --> 00:10:06,272
Unfortunately, a fire broke out
in the control room at the same time.

137
00:10:06,772 --> 00:10:10,735
Hello?
I just received a suspicious phone call.

138
00:10:11,152 --> 00:10:12,695
There will be a terrorist attack on--

139
00:10:15,740 --> 00:10:19,368
The officer who took the call
collapsed due to unknown causes.

140
00:10:20,119 --> 00:10:22,371
She's been brain-dead ever since,

141
00:10:22,455 --> 00:10:26,500
but the police aren't investigating,
and they're blocking press coverage.

142
00:10:27,209 --> 00:10:29,253
Something's fishy, isn't it?

143
00:10:30,880 --> 00:10:34,467
Strange things have happened to me too.

144
00:10:34,550 --> 00:10:35,718
That's why...

145
00:10:36,969 --> 00:10:39,138
I came to see you.

146
00:10:39,847 --> 00:10:44,310
Can you tell me what happened in Morocco?

147
00:10:46,103 --> 00:10:50,608
Mr. Cha, this case is very complicated.

148
00:10:50,691 --> 00:10:53,694
We need to find
as much evidence as possible,

149
00:10:53,778 --> 00:10:58,532
and put it all together
to see a clearer picture of the truth.

150
00:10:59,325 --> 00:11:00,409
I need your help.

151
00:11:05,581 --> 00:11:07,124
I'll do anything I can to help.

152
00:11:08,584 --> 00:11:12,838
But you must keep this a secret
from the NIS.

153
00:11:13,714 --> 00:11:16,592
-What?
-The ladies you're with,

154
00:11:16,676 --> 00:11:17,885
they're with the NIS, aren't they?

155
00:11:19,136 --> 00:11:21,931
-Yes. But how do--?
-Don't trust them.

156
00:11:22,932 --> 00:11:26,227
I'm giving you my advice based on
my experience and instinct as a reporter.

157
00:11:26,310 --> 00:11:28,813
You can't trust anyone,

158
00:11:28,896 --> 00:11:30,648
not even law enforcement.

159
00:11:32,024 --> 00:11:33,401
Cha Dal-geon.

160
00:11:33,484 --> 00:11:35,820
There's a coffee shop down the street.
Let's meet there.

161
00:11:40,241 --> 00:11:41,325
Who was that?

162
00:11:42,368 --> 00:11:43,452
He was asking for directions.

163
00:11:44,620 --> 00:11:47,373
How kind of you to take this long
to show him--

164
00:11:47,456 --> 00:11:49,250
If we're done here, let's go.

165
00:11:49,792 --> 00:11:50,918
Are you going home?

166
00:11:51,627 --> 00:11:54,672
We should stay together.
There's no guarantee we're safe in Korea.

167
00:11:54,755 --> 00:11:57,925
I'd be glad if those bastards
tried to mess with me. Call me later.

168
00:12:00,511 --> 00:12:02,096
What a tough guy.

169
00:12:03,431 --> 00:12:05,182
You two seem close.

170
00:12:05,266 --> 00:12:09,478
Is it like Doctor Zhivago,
where romance blossoms in times of war?

171
00:12:09,812 --> 00:12:12,398
The way he talks,
his personality and attitude...

172
00:12:12,648 --> 00:12:14,233
They're all perfect.

173
00:12:14,567 --> 00:12:17,069
Wow, that's deep.

174
00:12:17,153 --> 00:12:18,070
Yes.

175
00:12:18,738 --> 00:12:20,656
Unbelievably and perfectly...

176
00:12:21,198 --> 00:12:22,825
not my kind of thing at all.

177
00:12:22,908 --> 00:12:25,661
Not even the tiniest bit.

178
00:12:25,745 --> 00:12:28,122
Really? I had no idea.

179
00:12:28,205 --> 00:12:29,457
Let's get going, then.

180
00:12:35,463 --> 00:12:37,089
Hold on. Pull over.

181
00:12:38,716 --> 00:12:39,633
What's wrong?

182
00:12:47,183 --> 00:12:48,934
He's way too kind.

183
00:12:49,560 --> 00:12:51,437
Who would go as far as that
to give directions?

184
00:12:55,149 --> 00:12:59,195
You really did go through
a series of bizarre incidents in Morocco.

185
00:12:59,487 --> 00:13:01,238
It doesn't add up at all.

186
00:13:02,198 --> 00:13:04,033
Who'd do such a terrible thing?

187
00:13:04,408 --> 00:13:06,952
It might have something to do with
the bidding for the fighter jet project.

188
00:13:09,246 --> 00:13:11,665
The bidding for the fighter jet project?

189
00:13:15,920 --> 00:13:20,007
The government is investing ten billion
dollars in next-generation fighter jets.

190
00:13:20,299 --> 00:13:22,968
The company that stands
to benefit the most from the crash...

191
00:13:24,512 --> 00:13:25,846
is John & Mark.

192
00:13:26,555 --> 00:13:31,018
The rumors are that Dynamic,
its main competitor, will end up losing.

193
00:13:32,645 --> 00:13:35,523
Then... everything that happened...

194
00:13:36,690 --> 00:13:39,068
was planned by John & Mark?

195
00:13:39,151 --> 00:13:40,694
The question isn't who...

196
00:13:41,487 --> 00:13:42,404
but why.

197
00:13:43,364 --> 00:13:46,867
However, I'm only speculating,
so I may be wrong.

198
00:13:47,785 --> 00:13:49,954
I will know more once I meet my informant.

199
00:13:51,330 --> 00:13:52,164
Informant?

200
00:13:52,873 --> 00:13:58,045
I arranged to meet someone
to learn more about the plane crash.

201
00:13:58,128 --> 00:14:01,423
He has very important evidence
about the terrorist,

202
00:14:01,882 --> 00:14:02,716
just like you.

203
00:14:04,552 --> 00:14:06,428
Who is this informant?

204
00:14:06,512 --> 00:14:07,346
Excuse me.

205
00:14:10,975 --> 00:14:11,851
Yes, this is Jo speaking.

206
00:14:12,768 --> 00:14:14,895
Oh, okay.

207
00:14:15,104 --> 00:14:16,856
All right.
I'll be able to get there by then.

208
00:14:17,189 --> 00:14:18,524
I'll meet you there.

209
00:14:20,526 --> 00:14:22,987
Can I go with you?

210
00:14:23,070 --> 00:14:27,241
I'm not sure.
He's very cautious about being exposed.

211
00:14:38,002 --> 00:14:39,879
-Go after them.
-Really? Are you sure?

212
00:14:40,170 --> 00:14:41,005
Okay.

213
00:15:34,892 --> 00:15:37,144
What am I supposed to make of this?

214
00:15:37,937 --> 00:15:40,564
Why are those two men going into a motel?

215
00:15:42,858 --> 00:15:44,109
I'm here.

216
00:15:46,320 --> 00:15:47,363
Room 407?

217
00:15:48,030 --> 00:15:51,408
I came alone, so don't worry.

218
00:15:52,534 --> 00:15:54,161
I'll come right up.

219
00:15:55,329 --> 00:15:57,581
He seems very anxious.

220
00:16:00,334 --> 00:16:03,003
You should go up first.
Let me know when it's okay.

221
00:16:03,087 --> 00:16:05,673
Good idea. I'll call you soon.

222
00:16:05,756 --> 00:16:06,590
Okay?

223
00:16:27,861 --> 00:16:31,907
Jeez, it's been more than 30 minutes.

224
00:16:32,533 --> 00:16:35,995
What are we doing here
while two men are in there?

225
00:16:36,537 --> 00:16:38,038
Let's wait a bit more.

226
00:16:38,122 --> 00:16:39,957
Wait for what?

227
00:16:40,040 --> 00:16:41,959
To see how intimate they are?

228
00:16:42,668 --> 00:16:45,713
I see why you and Cha are not compatible.

229
00:16:46,672 --> 00:16:48,841
I don't think he's into men.

230
00:16:55,806 --> 00:16:58,642
The person you are trying to reach...

231
00:17:41,894 --> 00:17:42,936
Mr. Jo?

232
00:17:50,986 --> 00:17:51,904
Mr. Jo?

233
00:17:59,161 --> 00:17:59,995
No!

234
00:18:01,580 --> 00:18:04,208
Mr. Jo! What happened? Who did this?

235
00:18:08,045 --> 00:18:10,255
Oh, no. Mr. Jo.

236
00:18:10,964 --> 00:18:12,132
Mr. Jo... Mr. Jo!

237
00:18:12,716 --> 00:18:13,634
Shit.

238
00:18:23,060 --> 00:18:24,561
There's a man dying here.

239
00:18:25,646 --> 00:18:27,022
I think he's been stabbed.

240
00:18:28,065 --> 00:18:31,068
The address is...
It's a self-check-in motel in Sinwon-dong.

241
00:18:31,151 --> 00:18:31,985
It's called...

242
00:18:32,945 --> 00:18:34,947
Yes, that's right. Come as quick--

243
00:19:14,278 --> 00:19:15,112
Dal-geon!

244
00:19:20,993 --> 00:19:22,452
-Chase that bike!
-What?

245
00:19:22,536 --> 00:19:24,371
-Chase him!
-Chase him?

246
00:19:29,418 --> 00:19:32,129
-Drive faster!
-Okay, I heard you! Jeez.

247
00:19:36,300 --> 00:19:38,760
Just pass through. Just go!

248
00:19:42,639 --> 00:19:45,309
I told you to go!
You're a terrible driver!

249
00:19:45,392 --> 00:19:47,227
Are you crazy?!

250
00:19:47,311 --> 00:19:49,605
If we got into an accident,
who'd be responsible?

251
00:19:49,938 --> 00:19:51,440
Who was that?

252
00:19:51,523 --> 00:19:53,317
Tell me what's going on.

253
00:19:55,736 --> 00:19:56,653
There's been a homicide.

254
00:19:57,279 --> 00:19:58,238
A homicide?

255
00:19:59,031 --> 00:19:59,865
Who's the victim?

256
00:20:00,949 --> 00:20:02,451
A reporter from Pyeonghwa Daily.

257
00:20:03,493 --> 00:20:05,579
He was covering the plane crash.

258
00:20:06,413 --> 00:20:08,040
He came to meet an informant.

259
00:20:12,586 --> 00:20:14,755
-Let's go back to the motel.
-What?

260
00:20:14,838 --> 00:20:15,839
Jeez.

261
00:20:16,215 --> 00:20:17,758
What the heck is going on?

262
00:20:24,431 --> 00:20:25,891
You got a call, right?

263
00:20:26,308 --> 00:20:28,477
-Yes, about a homicide.
-I'm the one who reported it.

264
00:20:28,560 --> 00:20:29,603
Follow me, please.

265
00:20:32,564 --> 00:20:33,440
Hurry.

266
00:20:40,614 --> 00:20:41,490
Here...

267
00:20:41,949 --> 00:20:43,075
What?

268
00:20:45,035 --> 00:20:46,161
There's no one here.

269
00:20:47,287 --> 00:20:49,623
-What's going on? There's no one.
-What?

270
00:20:51,708 --> 00:20:52,668
What is this?

271
00:20:53,335 --> 00:20:54,544
You said someone was killed.

272
00:20:55,337 --> 00:20:58,131
Is this the right room?
Maybe it's a different one.

273
00:20:58,840 --> 00:21:00,550
He was right here.

274
00:21:00,634 --> 00:21:03,553
-He was bleeding heavily.
-Are you messing with us?

275
00:21:07,474 --> 00:21:08,934
You think I'm messing with you?

276
00:21:11,853 --> 00:21:13,313
This card belongs to the victim.

277
00:21:14,982 --> 00:21:17,150
And I also have his--

278
00:21:18,568 --> 00:21:20,195
I'm with the NIS.

279
00:21:21,071 --> 00:21:22,322
The NIS?

280
00:21:22,656 --> 00:21:24,449
Hwa-suk, show them your ID.

281
00:21:25,409 --> 00:21:26,243
I don't have it.

282
00:21:27,494 --> 00:21:29,997
-You don't?
-Who carries around an ID these days?

283
00:21:31,957 --> 00:21:35,335
Anyway, we saw him enter this building
with the reporter.

284
00:21:35,669 --> 00:21:38,130
Check his ID with the newspaper
and check the security footage.

285
00:21:38,213 --> 00:21:41,758
And get the Crime Scene Unit
to run a luminol test.

286
00:21:44,136 --> 00:21:45,554
Go and check the security footage.

287
00:21:46,430 --> 00:21:47,306
Okay.

288
00:21:49,933 --> 00:21:51,184
"Jo Bu-yeong."

289
00:21:56,481 --> 00:21:59,609
I'm looking for Jo Bu-yeong,
a city desk reporter.

290
00:21:59,985 --> 00:22:01,153
I can't reach him.

291
00:22:01,987 --> 00:22:02,821
Excuse me?

292
00:22:03,989 --> 00:22:04,823
On vacation?

293
00:22:05,824 --> 00:22:07,951
All right, I see.

294
00:22:08,035 --> 00:22:09,661
No, it's nothing.

295
00:22:10,078 --> 00:22:11,038
Sure.

296
00:22:12,873 --> 00:22:14,916
He went on vacation to New Zealand.

297
00:22:18,962 --> 00:22:20,672
I'm telling you, he's dead.

298
00:22:22,466 --> 00:22:24,760
Those bastards got rid of the body!

299
00:22:26,386 --> 00:22:29,348
I checked the security footage.
No one entered this room.

300
00:22:33,518 --> 00:22:34,978
Excuse me, officer...

301
00:22:37,064 --> 00:22:37,898
Sir...

302
00:22:39,066 --> 00:22:42,611
I'm going to let it slide this time,
but if this happens again,

303
00:22:42,694 --> 00:22:46,239
you'll be charged
with obstruction of justice. Got it?

304
00:22:48,158 --> 00:22:48,992
Let's go.

305
00:22:55,248 --> 00:22:56,917
What on earth is going on?

306
00:22:58,835 --> 00:23:01,338
I can't decide
whether to believe him or not.

307
00:23:01,797 --> 00:23:03,006
I believe him.

308
00:23:05,050 --> 00:23:06,301
You do?

309
00:23:06,802 --> 00:23:09,471
Something like this happened in Morocco.

310
00:23:10,764 --> 00:23:13,183
We don't need the police.
We'll investigate this ourselves.

311
00:23:17,979 --> 00:23:18,814
I almost forgot.

312
00:23:22,901 --> 00:23:24,486
What's this?

313
00:23:24,569 --> 00:23:26,071
Jo gave me this before he died.

314
00:23:31,910 --> 00:23:33,412
This is a flash drive.

315
00:23:35,038 --> 00:23:36,123
Plug it in over there.

316
00:23:41,670 --> 00:23:42,963
Doesn't it work?

317
00:23:43,338 --> 00:23:45,382
It doesn't fit. The connector is damaged.

318
00:23:45,465 --> 00:23:48,760
-Could the data be damaged as well?
-I'm not sure.

319
00:23:49,136 --> 00:23:51,346
-Let's go to my place first.
-Okay.

320
00:23:51,430 --> 00:23:52,597
You two go ahead.

321
00:23:53,181 --> 00:23:54,015
I'll catch up.

322
00:23:54,558 --> 00:23:55,392
Where are you going?

323
00:24:03,859 --> 00:24:04,693
CENTRAL PATRIOTS' MEETING HALL

324
00:24:04,776 --> 00:24:06,194
You did well.

325
00:24:06,570 --> 00:24:07,863
Next up is...

326
00:24:10,073 --> 00:24:12,617
Mr. Park Kwang-deok,
would you like to try?

327
00:24:13,577 --> 00:24:15,829
Me? Well...

328
00:24:16,830 --> 00:24:18,373
Maybe later.

329
00:24:18,457 --> 00:24:23,462
We're here to heal your emotional scars.

330
00:24:24,129 --> 00:24:28,133
You can speak freely
about whatever's on your mind.

331
00:24:37,851 --> 00:24:39,895
KEEP YOUR PROMISE, MR. PRESIDENT!

332
00:24:39,978 --> 00:24:40,937
THE GOVERNMENT MUST REVEAL THE TRUTH.

333
00:24:59,581 --> 00:25:00,415
Honey...

334
00:25:01,958 --> 00:25:02,918
do you remember?

335
00:25:03,710 --> 00:25:06,338
We didn't have an actual wedding,

336
00:25:07,047 --> 00:25:09,090
but I still got you a gold ring.

337
00:25:10,634 --> 00:25:12,302
You were so mad...

338
00:25:14,054 --> 00:25:16,723
so I went and got a refund,
just like an idiot.

339
00:25:18,892 --> 00:25:20,435
I should've put it on your finger.

340
00:25:22,229 --> 00:25:23,980
I don't know what to do.

341
00:25:27,192 --> 00:25:28,276
I feel terrible...

342
00:25:30,278 --> 00:25:33,073
for what happened to you
and our unborn baby.

343
00:25:34,449 --> 00:25:35,992
I feel so guilty.

344
00:25:36,576 --> 00:25:37,619
I'm so sorry.

345
00:25:39,371 --> 00:25:40,747
How can I go on?

346
00:25:42,791 --> 00:25:44,000
I miss you, Mi-seon.

347
00:25:49,297 --> 00:25:51,925
I'm sorry.

348
00:25:54,427 --> 00:25:56,346
REPRESENTATIVES
OF THE BEREAVED FAMILIES

349
00:26:10,652 --> 00:26:14,489
I'm surprised to see you working so hard.

350
00:26:15,073 --> 00:26:17,826
If I solve this,
I may get transferred back to Korea.

351
00:26:17,909 --> 00:26:19,536
That's not all.

352
00:26:19,619 --> 00:26:23,582
You could go up one--
No, two ranks through a promotion.

353
00:26:23,915 --> 00:26:26,334
I'll ask for a different position,
like a desk job.

354
00:26:26,835 --> 00:26:28,628
An easy road with guaranteed stability.

355
00:26:28,712 --> 00:26:31,965
Wow, you have it all planned out.

356
00:26:32,591 --> 00:26:36,928
You have been on Chief Min's bad side
because of your loyalty to Chief Gang.

357
00:26:40,307 --> 00:26:42,058
I hope this works.

358
00:26:47,105 --> 00:26:48,398
All right!

359
00:26:52,694 --> 00:26:53,903
What are all these files?

360
00:26:56,823 --> 00:26:58,366
It's information about Kim Woo-gi...

361
00:26:59,034 --> 00:27:00,201
the co-pilot of flight B357.

362
00:27:02,078 --> 00:27:03,455
I looked everywhere for this...

363
00:27:04,497 --> 00:27:05,999
and now here it is.

364
00:27:13,798 --> 00:27:16,468
Making breakfast for you
wasn't a big deal.

365
00:27:17,761 --> 00:27:19,638
I don't know why it irritated me.

366
00:27:20,013 --> 00:27:23,141
You leaving your socks everywhere
wasn't a big deal either.

367
00:27:24,392 --> 00:27:26,311
I regret it every day, honey.

368
00:27:28,438 --> 00:27:29,898
And even on that morning...

369
00:27:33,026 --> 00:27:36,154
I can't. I can't do this anymore.

370
00:27:36,529 --> 00:27:38,198
It's okay, Ms. O Sang-mi.

371
00:27:38,698 --> 00:27:39,783
ORDINARY GOVERNMENT EMPLOYEE

372
00:27:39,866 --> 00:27:41,034
There's no pressure. Take your time.

373
00:27:42,077 --> 00:27:42,994
Did you find anything?

374
00:27:43,370 --> 00:27:45,455
Kim Woo-gi's life insurance policies
are worth...

375
00:27:47,248 --> 00:27:48,375
nearly 5 billion won.

376
00:27:48,833 --> 00:27:50,794
He purchased them six months ago,

377
00:27:51,252 --> 00:27:52,420
and the beneficiary is...

378
00:27:54,381 --> 00:27:55,298
his wife.

379
00:27:56,132 --> 00:27:58,385
O Sang-mi might be an accomplice.

380
00:28:00,095 --> 00:28:01,721
They owed loan sharks over 1 billion won,

381
00:28:01,805 --> 00:28:03,932
but still paid 10 million
as a monthly premium...

382
00:28:04,724 --> 00:28:05,892
by taking out a bank loan.

383
00:28:07,852 --> 00:28:08,687
Hello?

384
00:28:09,354 --> 00:28:11,064
Dal-geon, are you there?

385
00:28:14,567 --> 00:28:16,486
-Thank you for your service.
-Thank you.

386
00:28:16,986 --> 00:28:18,446
Thank you.

387
00:28:21,616 --> 00:28:23,785
Thank you for organizing this meeting.

388
00:28:23,868 --> 00:28:26,079
I hope it helped.

389
00:28:26,621 --> 00:28:30,625
Ms. O told us a lot about you.
You're an international lawyer, right?

390
00:28:31,084 --> 00:28:33,002
Let me give you my card.

391
00:28:36,381 --> 00:28:37,465
Where's Kim Woo-gi?

392
00:28:43,555 --> 00:28:44,639
What do you mean?

393
00:28:44,723 --> 00:28:46,182
You know your husband...

394
00:28:47,559 --> 00:28:48,601
Kim Woo-gi, is alive.

395
00:28:54,733 --> 00:28:56,526
Why are you acting like this again?

396
00:28:56,776 --> 00:28:58,153
Hey, Mr. Cha--

397
00:28:58,236 --> 00:28:59,612
Where is that bastard?

398
00:28:59,696 --> 00:29:02,657
Are you crazy?
What are you doing to our representative?

399
00:29:02,907 --> 00:29:03,992
Our representative?

400
00:29:05,493 --> 00:29:07,036
Is she representing the families?

401
00:29:07,120 --> 00:29:10,749
Get out.
You don't deserve to be here. Get out!

402
00:29:10,832 --> 00:29:13,877
Get off me!
You're his accomplice, aren't you?

403
00:29:13,960 --> 00:29:15,086
Where's Kim Woo-gi?!

404
00:29:20,383 --> 00:29:22,969
He's way out of line. Enough is enough!

405
00:29:23,261 --> 00:29:24,345
Dal-geon...

406
00:29:24,429 --> 00:29:26,014
-What? What is it?
-Can someone...?

407
00:29:26,097 --> 00:29:27,807
Dal-geon?
Kwang-deok, this is serious.

408
00:29:27,891 --> 00:29:31,394
Oh, no! Dal-geon! Dal-geon, wake up!

409
00:29:31,478 --> 00:29:33,229
Hurry up and call 911!

410
00:29:34,105 --> 00:29:37,275
We have to save this man! Dal-geon!

411
00:29:37,358 --> 00:29:38,651
Dal-geon, wake up!

412
00:29:38,735 --> 00:29:41,488
-The ambulance is on its way.
-I specialize in judo, so...

413
00:29:41,946 --> 00:29:43,114
What's going on?

414
00:29:43,198 --> 00:29:45,408
He passed out.

415
00:29:45,492 --> 00:29:47,827
I threw him over my shoulder
for being a pain in the ass.

416
00:29:48,745 --> 00:29:49,954
We need...

417
00:30:07,430 --> 00:30:08,306
Shit!

418
00:30:09,474 --> 00:30:10,975
Are you okay?

419
00:30:11,518 --> 00:30:12,685
My name's Micky.

420
00:30:13,144 --> 00:30:14,479
I believe you know me.

421
00:30:15,438 --> 00:30:16,523
Where are we going?

422
00:30:16,606 --> 00:30:19,275
Mr. Edward Park
wanted you to see a doctor.

423
00:30:19,943 --> 00:30:21,277
I don't need a doctor.

424
00:30:21,986 --> 00:30:23,446
Where is he right now?

425
00:30:24,405 --> 00:30:25,490
He's busy.

426
00:30:26,282 --> 00:30:27,116
Why do you ask?

427
00:30:28,743 --> 00:30:32,205
Tell him I found the culprit
who crashed the plane.

428
00:30:34,666 --> 00:30:35,667
For now...

429
00:30:36,626 --> 00:30:38,586
it'd be best if you came to our office.

430
00:30:40,588 --> 00:30:43,716
ORDINARY GOVERNMENT EMPLOYEE

431
00:30:44,467 --> 00:30:46,427
Let us handle the case...

432
00:30:47,554 --> 00:30:48,763
against Dynamic System.

433
00:30:49,180 --> 00:30:51,266
Regardless of the outcome of the trial,

434
00:30:51,349 --> 00:30:54,602
it could take a year,
maybe even over a decade.

435
00:30:55,603 --> 00:30:57,438
And the cost will be enormous.

436
00:31:00,108 --> 00:31:02,068
Don't worry about the cost.

437
00:31:02,151 --> 00:31:06,239
Our fees will be paid once we win.

438
00:31:06,447 --> 00:31:09,909
The pain you'll experience
during the trial

439
00:31:10,785 --> 00:31:12,453
will be unbearable.

440
00:31:13,079 --> 00:31:16,124
That's right.
The trial will drag on for a long time.

441
00:31:16,207 --> 00:31:18,585
If you decide to settle, you'll be
compensated and it will end quickly.

442
00:31:19,085 --> 00:31:19,919
But...

443
00:31:21,796 --> 00:31:25,133
what about the sense of guilt
you're all suffering from?

444
00:31:25,466 --> 00:31:27,594
The pain you'll experience
during the trial...

445
00:31:28,970 --> 00:31:31,264
won't be as excruciating as the guilt.

446
00:31:32,557 --> 00:31:33,975
There's this saying that

447
00:31:34,267 --> 00:31:36,185
we don't know who we truly are

448
00:31:37,061 --> 00:31:39,439
until we have to make a choice.

449
00:31:40,857 --> 00:31:43,318
Whether you file a complaint
or settle with them,

450
00:31:43,610 --> 00:31:45,528
the choice is up to you.

451
00:31:46,696 --> 00:31:49,866
Why do we have to make that decision?

452
00:31:50,366 --> 00:31:52,327
We'd rather not
make this kind of decision.

453
00:31:53,912 --> 00:31:54,996
Oh, God...

454
00:31:57,248 --> 00:31:59,334
You should give up any hope
of reaching a settlement.

455
00:32:00,627 --> 00:32:03,379
It never occurred to me
that you'd take their case.

456
00:32:05,298 --> 00:32:06,507
Nice move.

457
00:32:07,592 --> 00:32:11,137
You used to be my hero,
but now you can't even read my moves.

458
00:32:12,805 --> 00:32:13,932
Maybe you should retire.

459
00:32:35,411 --> 00:32:36,329
Yes?

460
00:32:37,288 --> 00:32:39,374
Well, do you like the equipment?

461
00:32:39,791 --> 00:32:41,876
It's all perfect.

462
00:32:42,502 --> 00:32:45,421
Cha Dal-geon has started to run his mouth
to the grieving families.

463
00:32:45,505 --> 00:32:47,423
Get rid of him
before things get complicated.

464
00:32:47,924 --> 00:32:50,551
I'm working on it.

465
00:32:50,885 --> 00:32:53,096
Make sure that
it doesn't look like a murder.

466
00:32:53,513 --> 00:32:55,014
Come on.

467
00:32:55,723 --> 00:32:58,017
You talk too much.

468
00:32:59,018 --> 00:33:00,812
No wonder you're a lawyer.

469
00:33:01,854 --> 00:33:06,109
Once I'm done, I expect a large bonus.

470
00:33:07,694 --> 00:33:10,029
My boys are hearty eaters.

471
00:33:15,868 --> 00:33:18,079
Hey. Stop stuffing yourselves...

472
00:33:19,455 --> 00:33:21,040
and find out where he is.

473
00:33:24,293 --> 00:33:25,336
JM Pacific.

474
00:33:26,295 --> 00:33:29,257
It's the airline
Kim Woo-gi used to work for.

475
00:33:29,340 --> 00:33:30,675
It belongs to John & Mark.

476
00:33:31,300 --> 00:33:33,094
O Sang-mi was a flight attendant there.

477
00:33:34,637 --> 00:33:38,224
So when Kim Woo-gi
was in financial trouble,

478
00:33:38,516 --> 00:33:40,435
this Jessica woman recruited him?

479
00:33:40,518 --> 00:33:43,354
Yes, everything seems to point that way.

480
00:33:44,230 --> 00:33:45,481
I'm sorry, Dal-geon.

481
00:33:45,565 --> 00:33:48,776
I should've believed you back in Morocco.

482
00:33:51,779 --> 00:33:55,533
I didn't know Jessica
would be as corrupt as this.

483
00:33:55,783 --> 00:33:57,618
Do you know her well?

484
00:33:57,702 --> 00:34:00,621
The person who recruited
and mentored her in this business...

485
00:34:01,581 --> 00:34:02,498
was me.

486
00:34:03,374 --> 00:34:06,419
For her,
the end always justified the means.

487
00:34:06,794 --> 00:34:09,047
She grew dangerously ambitious,

488
00:34:09,505 --> 00:34:12,383
and eventually betrayed me
to go to John & Mark.

489
00:34:13,509 --> 00:34:16,804
It's my fault.
I should've been more careful with her.

490
00:34:17,597 --> 00:34:19,807
I don't understand.

491
00:34:19,891 --> 00:34:24,771
They killed civilians
over a fighter jet bid.

492
00:34:25,772 --> 00:34:28,566
Is this normal in your line of business?

493
00:34:30,443 --> 00:34:34,405
A few years ago in Chechnya,
hundreds of civilians were killed.

494
00:34:35,281 --> 00:34:37,200
John & Mark was involved.

495
00:34:38,993 --> 00:34:40,036
It's top secret information.

496
00:34:40,661 --> 00:34:42,914
The US government
was wary of international reaction,

497
00:34:42,997 --> 00:34:44,290
so they redacted the records.

498
00:34:45,625 --> 00:34:49,629
Do you happen to have any connections
with the police in Portugal?

499
00:34:52,882 --> 00:34:54,217
Why do you ask?

500
00:34:55,009 --> 00:34:58,513
The vice president of John & Mark
killed himself in Portugal

501
00:34:58,763 --> 00:35:02,058
on the day before the plane crash.

502
00:35:34,590 --> 00:35:38,469
Something's not right.
He wasn't the suicidal type at all.

503
00:35:39,846 --> 00:35:43,558
What if he was against the idea
of the plane crash?

504
00:35:44,350 --> 00:35:45,518
Isn't it possible

505
00:35:45,601 --> 00:35:48,938
that they killed him
and made it look like a suicide?

506
00:35:49,480 --> 00:35:50,565
Yes, that's possible.

507
00:35:50,648 --> 00:35:53,151
I have a friend
in the Portuguese intelligence service.

508
00:35:53,234 --> 00:35:54,485
I'll have him look into it.

509
00:35:56,320 --> 00:35:59,991
Will you all be going home
after you leave here?

510
00:36:00,449 --> 00:36:01,951
Where else would we go?

511
00:36:03,411 --> 00:36:06,080
I have a place nearby,

512
00:36:06,622 --> 00:36:10,168
and I want you to use it
as a safe house for the time being.

513
00:36:10,251 --> 00:36:13,045
Wow, this is scaring me.

514
00:36:13,296 --> 00:36:16,007
What about you? What happened
to your easy and stable road?

515
00:36:20,845 --> 00:36:21,762
Hello?

516
00:36:22,597 --> 00:36:23,764
Right now?

517
00:36:25,183 --> 00:36:26,809
I need to go to the office.

518
00:36:27,810 --> 00:36:29,061
Call me when you're done.

519
00:36:29,145 --> 00:36:31,147
I don't think I can make it back tonight.

520
00:36:31,230 --> 00:36:33,191
-See you later.
-Sure.

521
00:36:33,441 --> 00:36:34,358
Bye.

522
00:36:43,576 --> 00:36:46,579
It won't be uncomfortable for a few days.

523
00:36:47,163 --> 00:36:50,750
If you need anything,
contact my secretary.

524
00:36:51,584 --> 00:36:52,835
See you later.

525
00:36:57,340 --> 00:36:58,925
Edward Park.

526
00:36:59,717 --> 00:37:00,635
Long time no see.

527
00:37:01,969 --> 00:37:03,137
Do you know him?

528
00:37:03,221 --> 00:37:06,390
He could've been a client of mine,

529
00:37:06,474 --> 00:37:07,600
but I said no.

530
00:37:08,559 --> 00:37:10,394
He's a real son of a bitch.

531
00:37:37,588 --> 00:37:38,506
Those people...

532
00:37:39,173 --> 00:37:40,466
They're terrifying...

533
00:37:40,549 --> 00:37:41,926
Mr. Kim!

534
00:37:42,009 --> 00:37:43,344
Mr. Jo... Mr. Jo!

535
00:37:57,525 --> 00:37:59,986
This sister of yours
 is working on a huge case.

536
00:38:01,153 --> 00:38:05,074
If I solve this, I'll be reinstated at HQ
and I'll get a promotion.

537
00:38:05,449 --> 00:38:08,494
Don't tell Mom I'm here in Seoul.

538
00:38:08,577 --> 00:38:12,373
Because it drives me nuts
that she always asks me for money.

539
00:38:15,084 --> 00:38:16,627
I've got to go. Okay.

540
00:38:20,172 --> 00:38:23,301
-How's it going with your report?
-I told you I'm smart.

541
00:38:23,384 --> 00:38:25,803
The NIS people will be shocked
when they read it.

542
00:38:26,220 --> 00:38:27,596
GOD OF WAR

543
00:38:30,016 --> 00:38:33,394
Wow, I didn't know you were a god.

544
00:38:33,477 --> 00:38:35,521
A god of war to boot.

545
00:38:40,151 --> 00:38:41,527
Didn't you want to be
a martial arts director?

546
00:38:43,487 --> 00:38:46,741
Start acting again. It's what Hoon wanted.

547
00:38:51,203 --> 00:38:54,415
Oh, sorry. Maybe I stepped out of line.

548
00:38:56,167 --> 00:38:59,420
It's just that I remembered
what Hoon said in the video.

549
00:39:00,838 --> 00:39:01,922
Do you want some ramen?

550
00:39:02,757 --> 00:39:03,924
I make a mean ramen.

551
00:39:04,175 --> 00:39:06,052
I'm okay.

552
00:39:06,677 --> 00:39:08,888
You should rest. You must be tired.

553
00:39:21,275 --> 00:39:22,151
Thank you.

554
00:39:25,571 --> 00:39:26,781
For remembering Hoon.

555
00:39:45,257 --> 00:39:46,342
JOHN & MARK

556
00:39:56,685 --> 00:39:59,939
WILL JOHN & MARK'S NEXT GENERATION
FIGHTER PLAN PROJECT BE THE FINAL WINNER?

557
00:40:03,859 --> 00:40:06,278
JOHN & MARK'S F-X PROJECT
WAS SELECTED AS THE...

558
00:40:07,655 --> 00:40:09,573
WILL DYNAMIC SYSTEM
SURPASS JOHN & MARK?

559
00:40:09,657 --> 00:40:10,825
B-357 CRASH BECOMES NEW VARIABLE
IN FUTURE OF F-X PROJECT

560
00:40:12,743 --> 00:40:15,955
CIVIL ORGANIZATIONS DEMAND
DYNAMIC SYSTEM GIVES UP THE BID

561
00:40:19,333 --> 00:40:21,544
JOHN & MARK HOSTS CHARITY CONCERT

562
00:40:24,338 --> 00:40:26,424
THE CONCERT WILL BE AT 3 P.M.
AT HANGANG HOSPITAL

563
00:40:36,600 --> 00:40:37,768
Sorry I'm late.

564
00:40:38,477 --> 00:40:40,187
-Is Mr. O here?
-Yes, he is.

565
00:40:40,271 --> 00:40:42,106
-Okay.
-He's being very difficult.

566
00:40:42,189 --> 00:40:45,734
Well, he is the leader
of the opposition party.

567
00:40:48,237 --> 00:40:51,073
I'm sorry.
The civil liberty ceremony ended late.

568
00:40:51,157 --> 00:40:54,034
Help lighten the mood here,
Prime Minister Hong.

569
00:40:54,118 --> 00:40:55,911
It's been a while since I last saw Mr. O,

570
00:40:56,203 --> 00:40:58,164
but he's being very difficult.

571
00:40:58,414 --> 00:41:01,876
Senior Secretary Yun,
we need alcohol, not tea.

572
00:41:02,501 --> 00:41:05,629
Dear Mr. O is known
for being a heavy drinker.

573
00:41:06,422 --> 00:41:07,506
Forgive me.

574
00:41:07,590 --> 00:41:11,760
My party's stance on the F-X project
is unchanged.

575
00:41:12,094 --> 00:41:13,971
We don't understand

576
00:41:14,054 --> 00:41:17,725
why you have to choose John & Mark
and pay them an additional 1 trillion won.

577
00:41:20,686 --> 00:41:22,354
Explain it to him, Minister Park.

578
00:41:22,438 --> 00:41:25,232
Why insist on choosing John & Mark?

579
00:41:26,233 --> 00:41:28,527
Their outstanding technology
is worth the cost.

580
00:41:29,195 --> 00:41:30,196
That was concise.

581
00:41:30,613 --> 00:41:32,364
Did that answer your question?

582
00:41:32,448 --> 00:41:35,117
Reports that our experts submitted

583
00:41:35,618 --> 00:41:40,498
stated that Dynamic System's F70
is cheaper and superior.

584
00:41:40,789 --> 00:41:42,791
According to the Ministry
of National Defense's evaluation,

585
00:41:42,875 --> 00:41:46,462
John & Mark's Eagle Fighter
received a higher score.

586
00:41:47,796 --> 00:41:52,760
In any case, my party is firmly against
any supplementary budget.

587
00:41:53,093 --> 00:41:58,516
You must be well aware of
what the public thinks about Dynamic

588
00:41:58,807 --> 00:42:00,559
after the plane crash.

589
00:42:00,851 --> 00:42:03,229
Think about
the next presidential election.

590
00:42:03,312 --> 00:42:06,649
You have no business worrying about that.

591
00:42:07,566 --> 00:42:08,943
It's totally ours.

592
00:42:10,402 --> 00:42:12,446
I'm sure you know that

593
00:42:12,530 --> 00:42:15,449
independent national defense
is what I've focused on

594
00:42:15,533 --> 00:42:17,243
during my term at the Blue House.

595
00:42:17,826 --> 00:42:20,663
"When it comes to national defense,

596
00:42:20,746 --> 00:42:25,668
Jeong Gook-pyo
is like King Sejong the Great."

597
00:42:26,585 --> 00:42:28,254
That's what I want to hear.

598
00:42:30,839 --> 00:42:33,551
You know the creed I live by.

599
00:42:34,343 --> 00:42:35,844
Honesty and non-possession.

600
00:42:37,179 --> 00:42:40,474
Other than setting up a solid
and far-sighted national defense policy,

601
00:42:40,558 --> 00:42:43,143
I have no ulterior motives.

602
00:42:45,980 --> 00:42:48,148
Please work with us.

603
00:42:52,194 --> 00:42:55,197
Securing a supplementary budget
won't be easy.

604
00:42:56,615 --> 00:42:58,492
Those sons of bitches.

605
00:42:58,993 --> 00:43:02,329
It's like they have one agenda:
complaining about anything and everything.

606
00:43:02,413 --> 00:43:04,957
The opposition party is full of idiots.

607
00:43:06,709 --> 00:43:08,586
I will get to them one by one.

608
00:43:09,253 --> 00:43:11,505
We can solve this step by step.

609
00:43:11,589 --> 00:43:13,257
You don't need to be anxious.

610
00:43:14,008 --> 00:43:17,595
How did you tame Minister Park?

611
00:43:18,220 --> 00:43:20,306
He's a changed man now.

612
00:43:24,435 --> 00:43:25,728
Do you really want to know?

613
00:43:25,811 --> 00:43:29,315
I hope you didn't do anything
you shouldn't have.

614
00:43:33,027 --> 00:43:34,862
This will keep you entertained.

615
00:43:34,945 --> 00:43:36,780
-For your eyes only.
-Are you leaving?

616
00:43:37,031 --> 00:43:37,906
Yes.

617
00:43:53,631 --> 00:43:55,758
How did he even get these?

618
00:43:58,344 --> 00:44:00,971
He's a man with very odd talents.

619
00:44:05,768 --> 00:44:07,936
-It's been a while.
-How have you been?

620
00:44:08,020 --> 00:44:09,188
NATIONAL INTELLIGENCE SERVICE

621
00:44:10,022 --> 00:44:11,357
Hello.

622
00:44:12,232 --> 00:44:13,359
Hello. Oh, no.

623
00:44:16,111 --> 00:44:16,945
Shoot!

624
00:44:20,199 --> 00:44:21,075
Shit.

625
00:44:21,950 --> 00:44:22,785
Hae-ri!

626
00:44:24,244 --> 00:44:27,414
Didn't you apologize to Mr. Gi
for that incident?

627
00:44:27,498 --> 00:44:30,876
How could I?
I've been too embarrassed to call him.

628
00:44:31,335 --> 00:44:34,588
Are you stupid?
You'll run into him sooner or later.

629
00:44:34,672 --> 00:44:36,173
I don't want to think about it.

630
00:44:36,256 --> 00:44:38,592
You were the perpetrator,
and Gi was the victim.

631
00:44:38,676 --> 00:44:40,177
You can't keep avoiding him.

632
00:44:40,260 --> 00:44:42,096
-Okay?
-I don't want to hear it.

633
00:44:42,179 --> 00:44:45,391
-I don't want to hear it.
-Don't want to hear what?

634
00:44:45,474 --> 00:44:47,518
Hey, Gi Tae-ung!

635
00:44:55,901 --> 00:44:57,236
Are you deaf?

636
00:44:58,946 --> 00:45:02,408
I'm being transferred overseas.

637
00:45:02,491 --> 00:45:05,869
Far, far away to a remote place in Africa!

638
00:45:05,953 --> 00:45:07,246
She's drunk.

639
00:45:07,329 --> 00:45:10,165
What's wrong with her now?

640
00:45:10,249 --> 00:45:13,085
So what? What is it you want to say?

641
00:45:14,837 --> 00:45:15,921
You are...

642
00:45:17,548 --> 00:45:18,382
mine.

643
00:45:22,761 --> 00:45:23,595
What?

644
00:45:23,679 --> 00:45:25,806
Gi Tae-ung is mine,

645
00:45:25,889 --> 00:45:29,351
so he's off-limits to anyone.
I won't allow it.

646
00:45:29,685 --> 00:45:30,686
Understood?

647
00:45:31,979 --> 00:45:32,813
Hwa-suk!

648
00:45:35,899 --> 00:45:36,984
You're mine.

649
00:45:38,444 --> 00:45:40,946
-You're mine.
-Do something. Get her off.

650
00:45:41,029 --> 00:45:43,407
-Mine!
-Girl, are you insanely drunk?

651
00:45:43,490 --> 00:45:46,452
Sorry. Let's go home now. Let's go.

652
00:45:59,089 --> 00:46:00,090
What the...?

653
00:46:08,682 --> 00:46:10,058
Mine.

654
00:46:17,316 --> 00:46:21,528
Girl, if it wasn't for me,

655
00:46:21,612 --> 00:46:23,947
Gi would've beaten you to death.

656
00:46:24,031 --> 00:46:25,491
Where's the torture room?

657
00:46:25,574 --> 00:46:28,494
I need to be electrocuted
so my memory can be erased.

658
00:46:28,911 --> 00:46:31,079
Where is it? Where?

659
00:46:32,414 --> 00:46:33,665
He's coming this way.

660
00:46:34,666 --> 00:46:36,376
Stay if you want to keep your job.

661
00:46:46,637 --> 00:46:49,139
Hi, Mr. Gi. Good morning.

662
00:46:55,187 --> 00:46:56,939
It's been a while, Mr. Gi.

663
00:47:00,025 --> 00:47:02,820
I got back from Morocco
the day before yesterday.

664
00:47:03,320 --> 00:47:06,365
-Congratulations on your transfer--
-Do you still drink?

665
00:47:07,866 --> 00:47:08,700
I quit, sir.

666
00:47:08,784 --> 00:47:10,536
If it were up to me,
you wouldn't have been sent overseas.

667
00:47:13,664 --> 00:47:14,748
You're right.

668
00:47:15,374 --> 00:47:18,252
-I had such a hard time there.
-I'd have just fired you.

669
00:47:20,295 --> 00:47:22,798
An agent who who gets drunk
and acts carelessly?

670
00:47:24,174 --> 00:47:25,425
You're unqualified.

671
00:47:30,848 --> 00:47:31,682
What the...?

672
00:47:32,015 --> 00:47:34,142
That was so coldhearted of him.

673
00:47:36,436 --> 00:47:37,729
Are you okay?

674
00:47:39,857 --> 00:47:40,899
I'm fine.

675
00:47:41,275 --> 00:47:44,945
Once I submit my report today,
his arrogant attitude will change.

676
00:47:45,028 --> 00:47:48,240
You're right.
The NIS is going to go berserk.

677
00:47:48,323 --> 00:47:52,244
I'll totally ignore any transfer offer
from the Inspection Team.

678
00:47:53,245 --> 00:47:56,373
I can't pamper her anymore.
She's driving me nuts.

679
00:47:56,456 --> 00:47:57,666
Where are you going?

680
00:48:00,961 --> 00:48:02,004
Yes?

681
00:48:03,255 --> 00:48:04,172
Yes, sir.

682
00:48:04,882 --> 00:48:06,174
Was that the chief?

683
00:48:06,258 --> 00:48:08,802
He must've read the report.
He sounded so happy.

684
00:48:08,886 --> 00:48:10,137
Wait a second.

685
00:48:10,888 --> 00:48:12,014
Good luck, Go Hae-ri.

686
00:48:18,186 --> 00:48:20,939
What? Do you have something to say?

687
00:48:22,983 --> 00:48:25,068
I want to know why...

688
00:48:26,028 --> 00:48:27,154
there won't be an investigation.

689
00:48:28,113 --> 00:48:30,741
First, there's insufficient evidence.

690
00:48:30,824 --> 00:48:32,576
We have plenty of evidence.

691
00:48:32,910 --> 00:48:35,746
I confirmed that Kim Woo-gi
and the terrorist spoke on the phone.

692
00:48:36,246 --> 00:48:38,582
Jo Bu-yeong, a reporter
from Pyeonghwa Daily--

693
00:48:38,665 --> 00:48:41,710
Second, there's not enough evidence
to prove that John & Mark was involved.

694
00:48:42,419 --> 00:48:45,464
Did you even read the entire report?

695
00:48:45,547 --> 00:48:48,926
Third, if John & Mark tries to sue us,

696
00:48:49,009 --> 00:48:50,802
it'd be an international embarrassment.

697
00:48:50,886 --> 00:48:54,765
211 people died.
This is not the time to think about that!

698
00:48:54,848 --> 00:48:55,891
Fourth...

699
00:48:56,850 --> 00:48:59,311
I've got nowhere else to go
if I lose this job.

700
00:48:59,394 --> 00:49:01,396
-Sir!
-Shut up!

701
00:49:15,535 --> 00:49:17,454
I'll report this to the director.

702
00:49:17,788 --> 00:49:19,122
He ordered this.

703
00:49:21,041 --> 00:49:21,959
I beg your pardon?

704
00:49:22,042 --> 00:49:25,170
The order came from the director.

705
00:49:25,796 --> 00:49:28,715
You'll be assigned to a different country.

706
00:49:28,799 --> 00:49:32,344
Until then, try to keep Cha Dal-geon
from causing trouble. You may leave.

707
00:49:35,764 --> 00:49:38,558
Give me back the video evidence.

708
00:49:38,642 --> 00:49:42,187
Why are you asking me for that?
Ask the Inspection Team.

709
00:49:43,689 --> 00:49:45,565
You didn't even watch it?

710
00:49:47,359 --> 00:49:48,902
This is a warning.

711
00:49:49,152 --> 00:49:51,530
If you ever speak a word about this...

712
00:49:52,531 --> 00:49:53,490
you'll be fired.

713
00:49:54,116 --> 00:49:55,117
Keep that in mind.

714
00:49:55,200 --> 00:49:57,119
Does my return to HQ bother you that much?

715
00:49:57,202 --> 00:49:58,870
Get the hell out of here!

716
00:50:07,337 --> 00:50:08,255
Hae-ri.

717
00:50:46,168 --> 00:50:49,421
Drinking alone during the day
means you're an alcoholic.

718
00:50:49,504 --> 00:50:51,131
I can't agree
with the director's decision.

719
00:50:52,632 --> 00:50:53,550
So what?

720
00:50:54,676 --> 00:50:57,888
-What can you do about it?
-If Go Hae-ri is telling the truth...

721
00:50:58,764 --> 00:51:00,640
then we're neglecting our duty.

722
00:51:01,475 --> 00:51:04,603
Don't you feel ashamed of yourself?

723
00:51:11,026 --> 00:51:13,820
Do you still believe that
we're an intelligence agency?

724
00:51:14,780 --> 00:51:16,782
Ever since Director An was appointed,

725
00:51:17,449 --> 00:51:19,826
we've become errand boys
for the Blue House.

726
00:51:20,702 --> 00:51:22,329
Do you know what I do?

727
00:51:22,412 --> 00:51:26,208
I reply to Internet posts that criticize
the president and the government

728
00:51:26,291 --> 00:51:27,626
with nothing but lies.

729
00:51:31,463 --> 00:51:34,299
Either kiss the director's ass
like Min Jae-sik does,

730
00:51:34,382 --> 00:51:38,720
or get paid to do lame work like I do.

731
00:51:41,890 --> 00:51:43,809
I can't do either of those,

732
00:51:44,434 --> 00:51:45,769
so I should quit.

733
00:52:16,842 --> 00:52:19,344
-Hello?
-This is Park Kwang-deok.

734
00:52:19,970 --> 00:52:22,514
-Who?
-I'm sorry about the other day.

735
00:52:22,597 --> 00:52:23,849
Are you hurt in any way?

736
00:52:24,099 --> 00:52:26,476
No. I'm fine.

737
00:52:26,560 --> 00:52:30,021
Let's have lunch. My treat.
Where are you now?

738
00:52:31,022 --> 00:52:32,440
There's no need for that.

739
00:52:34,943 --> 00:52:36,027
I'm not mad.

740
00:52:37,696 --> 00:52:39,656
Look, I said I'm not mad!

741
00:52:40,073 --> 00:52:41,158
Jeez.

742
00:52:41,950 --> 00:52:42,826
Lunch?

743
00:52:43,201 --> 00:52:45,704
Fine, I'll meet you in 30 minutes.

744
00:52:48,707 --> 00:52:52,002
Our guest is getting ready to leave.
Let's get the party started.

745
00:53:06,016 --> 00:53:07,893
Get the radio frequency.

746
00:53:14,774 --> 00:53:17,402
I'm sorry about yesterday.

747
00:53:19,487 --> 00:53:21,531
Let's not talk about it.
It's embarrassing.

748
00:53:21,615 --> 00:53:23,825
As a martial artist,
I shouldn't have used so much force.

749
00:53:23,909 --> 00:53:25,785
Can you drop the subject?

750
00:53:27,746 --> 00:53:30,123
You said you need to be somewhere
by 3 p.m., right?

751
00:53:30,207 --> 00:53:32,292
We can grab something near there.
Where do you need to be?

752
00:53:32,375 --> 00:53:34,669
-Just keep going straight.
-Okay.

753
00:53:37,547 --> 00:53:38,715
Not yet?

754
00:53:39,132 --> 00:53:40,884
It's on.

755
00:53:50,602 --> 00:53:52,938
-What's wrong with this?
-Hit the brakes now!

756
00:53:53,021 --> 00:53:54,898
I... I am. I am.

757
00:54:04,950 --> 00:54:07,118
Hold on. What...? What's wrong?

758
00:54:08,078 --> 00:54:11,581
-I don't get it. It's a new car!
-Calm down. Take it easy.

759
00:54:11,665 --> 00:54:12,958
Oh, no!

760
00:54:23,677 --> 00:54:27,389
-I'll drive. Move to the back seat.
-Are you crazy? I can't switch seats now!

761
00:54:27,472 --> 00:54:29,266
I'm a stuntman! Do as I say!

762
00:54:29,933 --> 00:54:31,476
-Hold on. Grab the wheel.
-Go now!

763
00:54:31,559 --> 00:54:33,687
Grab it! Oh, no!

764
00:54:36,690 --> 00:54:37,732
What...?

765
00:54:38,233 --> 00:54:40,360
Oh, no! The car, the car!

766
00:54:41,278 --> 00:54:43,655
-Hold on tight.
-But it's a red light.

767
00:54:43,738 --> 00:54:46,866
Don't you know the program won't work
if we're not close enough?

768
00:54:49,327 --> 00:54:50,161
What's wrong with it?

769
00:54:58,461 --> 00:55:01,256
That car keeps following us.
They even jumped a red light.

770
00:55:04,217 --> 00:55:06,886
-It's them. They're trying to kill me.
-What? What did you say?

771
00:55:06,970 --> 00:55:10,223
I told you it was an act of terrorism!
They're involved!

772
00:55:10,307 --> 00:55:11,141
Damn it.

773
00:55:14,686 --> 00:55:17,355
SMALL HEART CONCERT
FOR CHILDREN WITH RARE DISEASES

774
00:55:17,439 --> 00:55:20,775
As baby's breaths are beautiful

775
00:55:21,234 --> 00:55:24,696
When together

776
00:55:25,113 --> 00:55:31,494
Let's get together
And gently embrace each other

777
00:55:31,911 --> 00:55:35,707
Into each small heart

778
00:55:35,790 --> 00:55:39,544
Plant tender love

779
00:55:39,627 --> 00:55:43,673
And let's make together

780
00:55:43,757 --> 00:55:47,302
A beautiful world!

781
00:55:55,226 --> 00:55:56,102
Shit!

782
00:55:56,186 --> 00:55:59,272
The phone's not working!
We could die here!

783
00:56:00,648 --> 00:56:04,402
Oh, Dal-geon! There are people! Oh, no!

784
00:56:04,486 --> 00:56:06,196
Quickly! There are people!

785
00:56:06,863 --> 00:56:09,449
Jeez. What the...?

786
00:56:16,539 --> 00:56:18,166
Watch out!

787
00:56:28,802 --> 00:56:30,595
Careful!

788
00:56:30,678 --> 00:56:32,597
Get out of the way!

789
00:56:42,857 --> 00:56:43,775
God! No!

790
00:56:49,114 --> 00:56:50,490
-Hold on!
-Damn it!

791
00:57:49,424 --> 00:57:51,968
Do you know what kind of people
I find most troublesome?

792
00:57:55,013 --> 00:57:56,473
Lucky sons of bitches.

793
00:58:13,323 --> 00:58:15,992
What just happened?
Tell me exactly what's going on.

794
00:58:17,160 --> 00:58:21,664
-You said you didn't believe me.
-No, I'll believe everything you say.

795
00:58:21,748 --> 00:58:23,208
I believe you, okay?

796
00:58:28,171 --> 00:58:30,673
FUND FOR TREATING CHILDREN
WITH RARE DISEASES

797
00:58:41,476 --> 00:58:42,352
Thank you.

798
00:58:44,979 --> 00:58:48,024
John & Mark has made donations
to many other organizations.

799
00:58:48,107 --> 00:58:50,860
Are these donations an effort
to sweeten the F-X deal?

800
00:58:50,944 --> 00:58:55,323
We don't want our good deeds to be known.
Please don't write about it.

801
00:58:55,406 --> 00:58:56,824
How about an interview?

802
00:58:56,908 --> 00:58:59,661
-Could you answer one question?
-I'm sorry.

803
00:58:59,744 --> 00:59:00,578
I'm sorry.

804
00:59:18,304 --> 00:59:19,347
Damn.

805
00:59:53,047 --> 00:59:53,923
