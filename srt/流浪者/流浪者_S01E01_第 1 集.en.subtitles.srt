1
00:04:18,049 --> 00:04:19,425
Nice to meet you!

2
00:04:19,968 --> 00:04:22,053
My name is Cha Dal-geon.

3
00:04:23,137 --> 00:04:26,057
I used to be in the taekwondo team
that represents Seoul.

4
00:04:26,140 --> 00:04:27,475
KOREA ACTION CENTER AUDITION

5
00:04:28,059 --> 00:04:31,938
I have a fifth-degree in taekwondo,
third in hapkido, and second in judo.

6
00:04:32,021 --> 00:04:36,567
I also practiced kendo and kickboxing
for some time, so...

7
00:04:36,651 --> 00:04:38,987
including the training,
 the total would be...

8
00:04:39,070 --> 00:04:41,447
eighteen degrees at the very least?

9
00:04:41,531 --> 00:04:43,408
Eighteen degrees at your age?

10
00:04:44,200 --> 00:04:45,785
Fifteen, then.

11
00:04:49,664 --> 00:04:50,665
Ready.

12
00:05:03,970 --> 00:05:05,763
-Hey, wake up!
-Are you okay?

13
00:05:06,180 --> 00:05:07,974
My anklebone, ouch!

14
00:05:14,105 --> 00:05:14,981
You're laughing?

15
00:05:21,696 --> 00:05:22,613
What's this?

16
00:05:23,197 --> 00:05:25,116
Man, this is embarrassing.

17
00:05:25,199 --> 00:05:27,869
I'm fine. Man, that was--

18
00:05:28,661 --> 00:05:30,621
Hey, Hoon. What's wrong?

19
00:05:30,705 --> 00:05:32,832
Hoon, I'm fine.

20
00:05:32,915 --> 00:05:34,917
Did I scare you?

21
00:05:35,001 --> 00:05:38,796
It was only a breaking demonstration.
Your uncle's fine.

22
00:05:38,880 --> 00:05:41,591
It's just a little blood.
Doesn't hurt at all. Look.

23
00:05:41,674 --> 00:05:43,051
Right? Look.

24
00:05:44,427 --> 00:05:46,429
No, don't cry. Hoon!

25
00:05:46,929 --> 00:05:48,139
This is nothing.

26
00:05:48,222 --> 00:05:50,892
This is not my son. He's my nephew.

27
00:05:51,434 --> 00:05:53,227
My big brother passed away so suddenly,

28
00:05:53,853 --> 00:05:56,773
so I have to raise this kid
into a fine young man.

29
00:05:56,856 --> 00:05:59,192
Please let me get this job.

30
00:05:59,901 --> 00:06:01,736
I'm good at anything physical.

31
00:06:02,403 --> 00:06:04,572
Just give me a chance,

32
00:06:05,031 --> 00:06:07,241
and I'll show you everything I've got.

33
00:06:07,325 --> 00:06:08,367
Thank you!

34
00:06:11,204 --> 00:06:12,038
You can go now.

35
00:06:12,121 --> 00:06:13,081
Scene one, take three!

36
00:06:13,164 --> 00:06:14,248
All right, cue. Get ready!

37
00:06:14,332 --> 00:06:17,293
-One, two, action!
-Go!

38
00:06:32,016 --> 00:06:34,769
That guy came at me for real!

39
00:06:34,852 --> 00:06:36,229
-Hurry up.
-Keep the bandage on.

40
00:06:36,312 --> 00:06:38,231
-Can you check both sides?
-Let's hurry up!

41
00:06:38,314 --> 00:06:39,899
Don't film this, please.

42
00:06:41,651 --> 00:06:42,610
Attention.

43
00:06:42,693 --> 00:06:44,612
-Bow.
-Bow!

44
00:06:52,829 --> 00:06:53,704
Congratulations.

45
00:07:09,137 --> 00:07:11,264
-Get over here!
-Are you okay?

46
00:07:12,515 --> 00:07:13,850
Help him out. Get the helmet.

47
00:07:15,017 --> 00:07:17,311
Are you okay? Take it easy.

48
00:07:18,688 --> 00:07:20,481
-You did well.
-Thank you, everyone.

49
00:07:20,565 --> 00:07:23,609
Excuse me, ma'am.
Could you move over, please?

50
00:07:25,570 --> 00:07:27,864
He's a taekwondo genius, a natural.

51
00:07:37,540 --> 00:07:38,749
One--

52
00:07:38,833 --> 00:07:39,876
On the floor!

53
00:07:40,626 --> 00:07:41,669
Put out the fire!

54
00:07:49,719 --> 00:07:51,596
-Dal-geon, are you okay?
-Yes, no problem.

55
00:07:51,679 --> 00:07:53,598
-Are we good to go?
-Okay!

56
00:07:54,974 --> 00:07:55,850
Come on.

57
00:08:11,115 --> 00:08:12,533
Why are you giving it to him?

58
00:08:13,993 --> 00:08:15,661
I'll do it.

59
00:08:15,745 --> 00:08:18,206
-I'll tie it.
-Hey, hold still.

60
00:08:18,289 --> 00:08:20,625
Take the shot of the black belt.
Come close.

61
00:08:21,125 --> 00:08:22,210
"Cha Hoon."

62
00:08:22,293 --> 00:08:23,794
-That's right. Cha Hoon.
-Come on!

63
00:08:24,629 --> 00:08:25,713
Yes!

64
00:08:39,685 --> 00:08:41,562

PARK MAN-YEONG
MINISTER OF NATIONAL DEFENSE

67
00:09:58,514 --> 00:10:02,560
A presentation on future fighter jets
that will lead Korea's air force

68
00:10:02,643 --> 00:10:05,438
took place this afternoon
at the War Memorial.

69
00:10:06,063 --> 00:10:10,067
Global defense companies
including Dynamic System, John & Mark

70
00:10:10,151 --> 00:10:13,070
and Flying Euro,
participated in this presentation,

71
00:10:13,154 --> 00:10:15,823
as well as defense officials, journalists,

72
00:10:15,906 --> 00:10:18,993
and civic groups,
and engaged in heated discussions.

73
00:10:19,076 --> 00:10:21,996
The Ministry of National Defense
will be spending 11 trillion won

74
00:10:22,079 --> 00:10:24,665
in purchasing
the next-generation fighter jets.

75
00:10:24,749 --> 00:10:27,960
The government announced that they will,
therefore, carefully select...

76
00:10:29,378 --> 00:10:30,838
Trillion, my ass.

77
00:10:31,505 --> 00:10:33,883
I can't even pay the dues
to the cab company.

78
00:10:34,592 --> 00:10:35,593
Get off, now.

79
00:10:36,010 --> 00:10:39,305
-You're really not coming back?
-Stop saying that. I quit for good.

80
00:10:39,388 --> 00:10:41,599
But you wanted to become
a martial arts director.

81
00:10:41,682 --> 00:10:44,769
After all the trouble you went through,
you will let it go to waste?

82
00:10:44,852 --> 00:10:46,062
I'm mad I wasted my time.

83
00:10:46,729 --> 00:10:49,482
If I quit earlier,
I would've saved more money by now.

84
00:10:49,565 --> 00:10:50,691
-Damn it.
-Gosh.

85
00:10:50,775 --> 00:10:52,318
Go, now. I don't want to be seen.

86
00:10:52,401 --> 00:10:55,279
Dal-geon.
We've never done it for the money, right?

87
00:10:55,363 --> 00:10:57,365
Dream. Hope.

88
00:10:57,448 --> 00:10:58,908
Vision, right?

89
00:11:00,034 --> 00:11:01,744
If I die on set,

90
00:11:01,827 --> 00:11:04,789
will you raise my nephew,
into a man with vision?

91
00:11:05,539 --> 00:11:07,917
-Vision, my ass.
-What I meant was--

92
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:09,877
HOONI

93
00:11:11,796 --> 00:11:14,340
-Yeah, Hoon.
-Where are you?

94
00:11:14,882 --> 00:11:16,509
I'm on set, of course!

95
00:11:16,592 --> 00:11:18,928
Man, it's suffocating
to be out here today.

96
00:11:19,011 --> 00:11:20,721
They cut off the water.

97
00:11:21,097 --> 00:11:24,475
If we don't pay the bills by tomorrow,
they'll shut off the gas, too.

98
00:11:24,558 --> 00:11:26,352
Those cruel bastards.

99
00:11:27,269 --> 00:11:29,438
Hey, don't worry. I'll pay it tomorrow.

100
00:11:30,564 --> 00:11:31,524
With what?

101
00:11:31,607 --> 00:11:34,193
What else?
A stuntman earns money from stunts.

102
00:11:34,860 --> 00:11:36,570
But it's not payday yet.

103
00:11:37,863 --> 00:11:40,449
Actually, I got a role
with lines this time.

104
00:11:40,533 --> 00:11:42,827
It pays better than my usual stunt roles.

105
00:11:42,952 --> 00:11:45,121
-We're filming again!
-Yes, sir!

106
00:11:45,663 --> 00:11:49,125
I'll be coming home soon.
Get the rice ready. Bye!

107
00:11:51,085 --> 00:11:53,212
Jeez. He asks so many questions.

108
00:11:54,255 --> 00:11:55,965
Give me some money.
I'll pay back next week.

109
00:11:56,048 --> 00:11:57,216
-Next week?
-Yeah.

110
00:11:58,092 --> 00:12:00,219
I knew I could count on you.

111
00:12:00,302 --> 00:12:01,429
Keep the change.

112
00:12:01,929 --> 00:12:04,390
-Hey, come on.
-Hey, come on.

113
00:12:05,558 --> 00:12:07,977
-Hey, come on!
-Stop that.

114
00:12:08,060 --> 00:12:09,645
-You cheap bastard!
-I'm going.

115
00:12:09,728 --> 00:12:11,272
-Bye!
-Hey!

116
00:12:16,735 --> 00:12:19,864
Gosh, he drank again.

117
00:12:20,656 --> 00:12:22,241
I wish he'd stop drinking.

118
00:12:24,326 --> 00:12:26,328
He's hopeless.

Hello?

126
00:13:21,050 --> 00:13:22,843
Is this the Action Center?

127
00:13:23,761 --> 00:13:25,221
Is Mr. Cha Dal-geon there?

128
00:13:26,055 --> 00:13:28,098
Dal-geon quit his job.

129
00:13:29,058 --> 00:13:30,309
Is this Hoon?

130
00:13:44,698 --> 00:13:47,785
I told you I'd get you barbecue.
Why do you want noodles?

00:13:49,620 --> 00:13:50,746
Here.

132
00:13:50,913 --> 00:13:53,916
What do you need
for your trip to Morocco next week?

133
00:13:54,750 --> 00:13:55,626
I'm not going.

134
00:13:56,794 --> 00:13:59,088
-Why not?
-I don't feel like going.

135
00:14:00,506 --> 00:14:03,050
Don't you know how amazing this is?

136
00:14:03,592 --> 00:14:07,555
Other kids would die to be
on the taekwondo demo team.

137
00:14:07,638 --> 00:14:10,724
And you're formally invited
by the Moroccan government.

138
00:14:10,808 --> 00:14:14,395
-So everything's gonna be free, no?
-Only the flight and hotel are free.

139
00:14:14,937 --> 00:14:16,272
We have to pay for the expenses.

140
00:14:19,692 --> 00:14:21,527
You think I can't afford it?

141
00:14:22,861 --> 00:14:24,530
You're only 11 years old.

142
00:14:24,613 --> 00:14:26,115
Act like a kid.

143
00:14:26,198 --> 00:14:29,326
You should be begging me to let you go,
not worrying about money.

144
00:14:29,410 --> 00:14:31,954
Then you act like a grown-up!

145
00:14:32,580 --> 00:14:35,124
Why are you yelling at me?

146
00:14:35,207 --> 00:14:36,542
You don't know anything.

147
00:14:37,167 --> 00:14:39,837
-What?
-Stupid uncle...

148
00:14:39,920 --> 00:14:42,798
Stupid? What don't I know?

149
00:14:42,882 --> 00:14:44,592
Hey, Hoon!

150
00:14:46,844 --> 00:14:49,805
He's looking down on his uncle these days.

151
00:14:49,889 --> 00:14:51,390
You just wait, kid!

152
00:14:51,473 --> 00:14:53,309
I'm going to make a lot of money,

153
00:14:53,434 --> 00:14:55,895
feed you beef every day
and buy you fancy clothes.

154
00:14:56,437 --> 00:14:59,523
I'll follow you around
buying you stuff until you've had enough.

155
00:15:03,777 --> 00:15:06,238
I mean, how great is this?

00:16:00,167 --> 00:16:02,795
Good morning! You lot are early!

164
00:16:04,046 --> 00:16:06,924
Well, there was an accident outside

165
00:16:07,007 --> 00:16:09,802
and the bike rider fell
right in front of my car.

166
00:16:09,885 --> 00:16:12,096
My heart's still pounding.

167
00:16:12,179 --> 00:16:13,681
Um, Miss Go.

168
00:16:13,764 --> 00:16:17,142
Here's the demo team's schedule
and progress report.

169
00:16:17,226 --> 00:16:21,021
It should've been ready earlier,
but the Moroccans are not helpful.

170
00:16:21,105 --> 00:16:23,357
50TH ANNIVERSARY DIPLOMATIC RELATIONS
COMMEMORATIVE EVENT REPORT

171
00:16:24,316 --> 00:16:26,402
You already have them.

172
00:16:26,485 --> 00:16:27,820
The meeting is over.

173
00:16:29,321 --> 00:16:31,407
Oh, okay.

174
00:16:31,907 --> 00:16:33,283
Sorry, sir.

175
00:16:37,997 --> 00:16:39,289
Take it.

176
00:16:40,708 --> 00:16:42,668
Mom, I'll call you back.

177
00:16:45,295 --> 00:16:47,339
Moroccan journalists are waiting outside.

178
00:16:47,423 --> 00:16:50,175
If you're not competent,
you should at least act sensibly.

179
00:16:51,176 --> 00:16:52,928
I've never seen an intern so carefree!

180
00:16:55,806 --> 00:16:56,890
I'm sorry.

181
00:16:58,142 --> 00:16:59,184
You...

182
00:17:13,907 --> 00:17:15,117
Elsa here.

183
00:17:17,786 --> 00:17:19,747
I'll retrieve it and send it right away.

184
00:17:29,298 --> 00:17:31,216
Shit, it's locked again.

185
00:17:40,309 --> 00:17:41,435
What the...

186
00:17:42,019 --> 00:17:44,646
What are you doing here, locked up alone?

187
00:17:48,150 --> 00:17:50,611
I got a run in my tights.

188
00:17:51,653 --> 00:17:53,739
I'll leave as soon as I get changed.

189
00:17:53,822 --> 00:17:57,284
You're showing us a lot of things today.

190
00:17:58,035 --> 00:18:00,496
Get it done quickly and come out.

191
00:18:26,647 --> 00:18:28,732
-Not easy?
-No, ma'am.

192
00:18:29,316 --> 00:18:32,236
Our bid is one trillion won higher
than that of Dynamic System

193
00:18:32,319 --> 00:18:36,073
and F70 is evaluated to perform better
than our Eagle Fighter.

194
00:18:36,156 --> 00:18:39,451
So what?
What is the Blue House's response exactly?

195
00:18:39,535 --> 00:18:43,705
The President wants to support us
but they also can't ignore public opinion.

196
00:18:43,789 --> 00:18:47,501
What was our lobbying for then?
Wasn't it for them to ignore such things?

197
00:18:47,584 --> 00:18:49,419
You know how the President is.

198
00:18:50,212 --> 00:18:51,880
He is very careful.

199
00:18:51,964 --> 00:18:53,090
F-X COMPANY REPORT

200
00:18:53,173 --> 00:18:55,300
That's not careful. That's sneaky.

201
00:18:55,926 --> 00:18:57,803
He only cares about his benefits.

202
00:19:01,014 --> 00:19:02,432
Is the Blue House still accessible?

203
00:19:04,518 --> 00:19:05,519
Yes, ma'am.

204
00:19:05,602 --> 00:19:07,688
We lose that then we're doomed.

205
00:19:08,230 --> 00:19:11,525
Keep it accessible until this is all over.

206
00:20:19,301 --> 00:20:20,302
ONE WEEK LATER, SEOUL

207
00:20:20,385 --> 00:20:23,430
Perfect! The yolk is safe.

208
00:20:23,513 --> 00:20:24,723
Let's eat!

209
00:20:24,806 --> 00:20:26,016
No.

210
00:20:27,809 --> 00:20:30,229
Come and have some.
I'll take you to the airport.

211
00:20:30,312 --> 00:20:32,856
You don't need to.
I'm taking the team bus.

212
00:20:35,317 --> 00:20:36,610
Hey, Hoon.

213
00:20:37,236 --> 00:20:39,571
Why are you so grumpy lately?

214
00:20:40,322 --> 00:20:41,949
Is it because of the sneakers?

215
00:20:42,491 --> 00:20:46,119
I said I'll get you the best pair of shoes
once you return from Morocco.

216
00:20:46,662 --> 00:20:47,746
Hey!

217
00:20:49,248 --> 00:20:51,250
Raising you is stressful enough.

218
00:20:51,750 --> 00:20:55,254
-The least you could do is listen to me.
-I regret living with you, too.

219
00:20:55,337 --> 00:20:57,089
Then go back to the orphanage!

220
00:21:02,469 --> 00:21:03,512
I mean...

221
00:21:05,180 --> 00:21:08,141
How should I know what's wrong
if you don't talk to me?

222
00:21:08,225 --> 00:21:10,269
Look at you, all quiet and pouting.

223
00:21:10,852 --> 00:21:13,563
You can't expect me to know what's up.
Stop.

224
00:21:15,607 --> 00:21:17,859
I still don't get it, but I'm sorry.

225
00:21:17,943 --> 00:21:20,988
So pop this into your mouth
before it gets cold.

226
00:21:24,283 --> 00:21:25,575
Last chance.

227
00:21:25,659 --> 00:21:26,743
If you don't eat it...

228
00:21:28,412 --> 00:21:29,913
this is mine.

229
00:21:29,997 --> 00:21:31,373
You're not eating it?

230
00:21:31,456 --> 00:21:32,666
One.

231
00:21:33,375 --> 00:21:34,334
Two.

232
00:21:36,003 --> 00:21:37,170
Fine.

233
00:21:37,963 --> 00:21:39,506
Oh, it's hot!

234
00:21:39,589 --> 00:21:42,426
Hey, Hoon!

235
00:21:42,509 --> 00:21:43,552
Hoon!

236
00:21:48,640 --> 00:21:50,892
What a fussy kid.
No wonder he is my nephew.

237
00:21:55,147 --> 00:21:58,400
I shouldn't have waited
for his birthday to buy those shoes.

238
00:23:34,788 --> 00:23:36,915
Incheon International Airport Police.

239
00:23:38,792 --> 00:23:41,878
We are receiving a lot of calls.
Please call again.

240
00:23:43,630 --> 00:23:44,965
We are receiving a lot of calls...

241
00:24:13,326 --> 00:24:15,162
-One, two!
-Do what the instructor says.

242
00:24:15,245 --> 00:24:16,371
Come on, kids.

243
00:24:16,872 --> 00:24:19,291
-Where's your card?
-Drink plenty of water, okay? Get up.

244
00:24:19,374 --> 00:24:21,585
-Hello.
-How are you?

245
00:24:21,668 --> 00:24:23,170
You're going so far away.

246
00:24:23,253 --> 00:24:25,422
-You've got this. You can do it, right?
-Yes.

247
00:24:34,222 --> 00:24:35,724
STUPID UNCLE

248
00:24:41,771 --> 00:24:45,317
Really? Thank you. Yes!

249
00:24:46,735 --> 00:24:47,986
I'm worried.

250
00:24:48,069 --> 00:24:51,198
Don't be. I'm not traveling alone.
It's a group tour.

251
00:24:51,281 --> 00:24:53,325
Not you. I'm worried about myself.

252
00:24:53,408 --> 00:24:55,577
How am I supposed to live without you
for a couple of weeks?

253
00:24:55,660 --> 00:24:56,536
Wow.

254
00:24:58,538 --> 00:24:59,706
Are you that happy?

255
00:25:00,749 --> 00:25:02,500
I'm having a baby.

256
00:25:03,543 --> 00:25:05,378
-What?
-Five weeks in.

257
00:25:07,672 --> 00:25:08,632
I'm going to be a dad?

258
00:25:08,715 --> 00:25:09,674
-Yes.
-Really?

259
00:25:09,758 --> 00:25:12,010
I'm a dad now!

260
00:25:14,054 --> 00:25:15,722
-Put me down.
-Oops, sorry.

261
00:25:15,805 --> 00:25:17,098
-You're embarrassing me!
-Why?

262
00:25:17,182 --> 00:25:20,393
Hey, your passport. For crying out loud.

263
00:25:20,477 --> 00:25:22,979
How do you plan to go overseas
without a passport?

264
00:25:24,022 --> 00:25:26,274
Are you sure you can take care
of all those children?

265
00:25:26,358 --> 00:25:28,026
Hush. They're listening.

266
00:25:28,109 --> 00:25:31,238
-I'm an instructor.
-Whatever. Pay for my transportation.

267
00:25:31,321 --> 00:25:33,573
Ripping off your brother?
You're really something.

268
00:25:33,657 --> 00:25:36,117
I'm also charging you for the food
I packed for you.

269
00:25:36,201 --> 00:25:39,412
Yeah, you do that.
Take everything from your only brother.

270
00:25:39,496 --> 00:25:41,289
Hey!

271
00:25:41,373 --> 00:25:43,375
Gather around, team!

272
00:25:45,752 --> 00:25:47,504
Say goodbye to your parents.

273
00:25:53,802 --> 00:25:56,263
Uncle, I'm getting on the plane now.

274
00:25:57,347 --> 00:26:00,517
I doubt you will miss me but if you do,

275
00:26:01,142 --> 00:26:02,352
check the cloud.

276
00:26:02,894 --> 00:26:04,521
I'll upload videos.

277
00:26:18,785 --> 00:26:20,620
Yes, Incheon International Airport Police.

278
00:26:44,519 --> 00:26:46,396
-Finally.
-Your passport, please.

279
00:27:19,637 --> 00:27:23,391
-What's going on?
-Where's the fire?

280
00:27:24,851 --> 00:27:25,935
Where's the fire?

281
00:27:26,478 --> 00:27:28,855
Fire!

282
00:27:47,290 --> 00:27:51,169
Hello?
I just received a suspicious phone call.

283
00:27:51,795 --> 00:27:53,421
There will be a terrorist attack on--

284
00:27:56,966 --> 00:27:58,134
Sergeant Park!

285
00:27:58,218 --> 00:28:00,220
Stay with me, Park!

286
00:28:00,303 --> 00:28:02,263
-Call the ambulance!
-Yes, sir.

287
00:28:02,931 --> 00:28:05,225
-Don't go to a naming place!
-Hello.

288
00:28:05,308 --> 00:28:07,185
We don't know yet if it's a boy or a girl.

289
00:28:07,268 --> 00:28:09,646
Listen, everyone! Make sure you see
who's sitting next to you.

290
00:28:09,729 --> 00:28:12,690
Phone calls will be too expensive,
so text them to me.

291
00:28:13,817 --> 00:28:17,237
I'll choose. Yes, wait a minute.

292
00:28:19,114 --> 00:28:22,700
You two, give me your cellphones.
The door is closing, Hoon. Sit down.

293
00:28:22,784 --> 00:28:25,495
Sit down and stay there.

294
00:28:25,578 --> 00:28:27,622
Hey, stop!
Give it to me and put your bag up there.

295
00:28:27,705 --> 00:28:29,207
Come on now, quickly.

296
00:28:30,166 --> 00:28:32,001
-Stay seated.
-Pass it to me!

297
00:28:33,586 --> 00:28:34,504
Go in.

298
00:28:34,587 --> 00:28:36,339
You pushed me first.

299
00:28:36,423 --> 00:28:38,675
-Go in. Go in and sit down.
-You pushed me first.

300
00:28:43,805 --> 00:28:46,015
What's up with all those kids?

301
00:28:46,725 --> 00:28:48,476
It's a taekwondo demo team.

302
00:28:48,560 --> 00:28:50,311
Oh, a national team?

303
00:28:50,854 --> 00:28:52,480
We'd better do our best.

304
00:28:54,190 --> 00:28:55,483
-May I take this call?
-Sure.

305
00:28:57,277 --> 00:28:58,486
Honey...

306
00:28:59,362 --> 00:29:01,114
I have been waiting for your call.

307
00:29:01,197 --> 00:29:03,324
Can you speak Spanish as well?

308
00:29:04,659 --> 00:29:08,371
Don't worry, he doesn't
understand what we're talking about.

309
00:30:31,120 --> 00:30:32,205
Miss Go Hae-ri!

310
00:30:34,999 --> 00:30:36,167
What a coincidence.

311
00:30:36,251 --> 00:30:37,752
What brings you here?

312
00:30:37,836 --> 00:30:40,505
A friend of mine is arriving from Spain.

313
00:30:41,714 --> 00:30:45,301
-You haven't heard the news, right?
-What news?

314
00:30:45,385 --> 00:30:49,305
The National Intelligence Service
arrested our consul last night.

315
00:30:49,389 --> 00:30:51,683
What? What did he do?

316
00:30:51,766 --> 00:30:54,727
He received bribes from a local drug gang.

317
00:30:54,811 --> 00:30:56,521
They're not drugs. Okay?

318
00:30:56,604 --> 00:30:58,982
And those drugs were smuggled into Korea.

319
00:31:02,527 --> 00:31:06,239
No wonder. I thought
his eyes always looked a bit drowsy.

320
00:31:08,074 --> 00:31:10,535
He didn't do drugs. He received bribes.

321
00:31:10,618 --> 00:31:12,829
-Oh.
-Darn it.

322
00:31:13,454 --> 00:31:15,373
This means trouble for us.

323
00:31:15,456 --> 00:31:17,792
The taekwondo kids are arriving tomorrow.

324
00:31:17,876 --> 00:31:20,128
I bet it leaked from the inside.

325
00:31:21,838 --> 00:31:24,090
Do you know who's the whistle-blower?

326
00:31:25,425 --> 00:31:27,343
Why are you looking at me like that?

327
00:31:27,427 --> 00:31:29,971
What about my eyes?
These are my pretty eyes.

328
00:31:30,054 --> 00:31:31,890
They are pretty. I mean...

329
00:31:32,390 --> 00:31:34,601
Anyways, let's watch out.

330
00:31:34,726 --> 00:31:37,854
We're contract workers. Who cares?
See you tomorrow.

331
00:31:40,148 --> 00:31:41,941
What was your business in Portugal?

332
00:31:46,905 --> 00:31:50,283
I noticed you making phone calls secretly
in the office.

333
00:31:50,992 --> 00:31:53,453
Is there something in Portugal?

334
00:31:54,746 --> 00:31:55,955
Like a boyfriend?

335
00:31:57,540 --> 00:31:59,500
What the hell is wrong with men?

336
00:32:00,293 --> 00:32:03,922
-What?
-How can anyone cheat on a woman like me?

337
00:32:04,672 --> 00:32:07,884
He seemed fine
but turned out to be a total lunatic.

338
00:32:08,718 --> 00:32:10,470
If only I had a gun,

339
00:32:10,553 --> 00:32:13,556
I would've shot him in the head
before coming back.

340
00:32:15,308 --> 00:32:16,726
For god's sake.

341
00:32:17,727 --> 00:32:19,520
I didn't know she was so fiery.

342
00:32:20,730 --> 00:32:22,023
Cheer up, Hae-ri!

343
00:32:22,523 --> 00:32:23,816
In this world,

344
00:32:24,442 --> 00:32:26,361
there are good men, too!

345
00:32:26,486 --> 00:32:28,279
You must be exhausted.

346
00:32:28,947 --> 00:32:30,281
Rest well!

347
00:32:30,949 --> 00:32:32,325
I love the breeze!

348
00:32:50,301 --> 00:32:52,387
I just returned from Lisbon.

349
00:32:55,014 --> 00:32:57,850
Yes. Suicide with a pistol.

350
00:33:02,772 --> 00:33:05,441
An autopsy won't change anything.

351
00:33:06,776 --> 00:33:07,694
Yes.

352
00:33:27,714 --> 00:33:28,923
BABY GIRL NAMES

00:33:32,260 --> 00:33:33,302
Ju-hui...

355
00:33:33,928 --> 00:33:35,388
Let me fill your cup.

356
00:34:07,962 --> 00:34:10,423
-A cup of coffee, please.
-Yes, sir.

357
00:35:50,940 --> 00:35:52,733
Please fasten your seat belts!

358
00:35:54,777 --> 00:35:56,070
Fasten your seat belts!

359
00:36:02,785 --> 00:36:03,786
What's wrong?

360
00:36:06,038 --> 00:36:08,374
-What is this?
-Engine number three failed.

361
00:36:08,457 --> 00:36:11,627
-The cabin altitude is rising.
-Do we have a hole somewhere?

362
00:36:19,177 --> 00:36:20,469
Put your mask on, quick!

363
00:36:21,596 --> 00:36:24,348
Ladies and gentlemen.
We're experiencing some turbulence.

364
00:36:24,432 --> 00:36:26,893
Please return to your seats
and fasten your seat belts.

365
00:36:41,449 --> 00:36:42,867
Hold on!

366
00:36:53,794 --> 00:36:57,131
Hold tight, guys! Sit down!

367
00:37:00,718 --> 00:37:02,595
Get up, quick. Sit down.

368
00:37:43,219 --> 00:37:44,762
Why isn't the panel working?

369
00:37:44,845 --> 00:37:47,556
Latitude, altitude, airspeed.
Nothing's visible, sir.

370
00:37:47,640 --> 00:37:48,975
Let's stand by and take control.

371
00:37:49,767 --> 00:37:51,811
The stick isn't working. What's wrong?

372
00:37:58,359 --> 00:38:00,945
Unable to control aircraft
due to technical problems.

THERE'S BEEN A HUGE INCIDENT

378
00:39:43,756 --> 00:39:45,966
It's an emergency.
Come to the embassy, now!

379
00:39:49,261 --> 00:39:50,554
Enjoy.

380
00:39:50,638 --> 00:39:52,807
We should've ended things
after round two last night.

381
00:39:59,730 --> 00:40:00,815
That kid.

382
00:40:01,732 --> 00:40:03,150
I should've bought them sooner.

SBC BREAKING NEWS

384
00:40:10,616 --> 00:40:11,784
What's that?

385
00:40:13,411 --> 00:40:15,079
Excuse me, turn the volume up, please.

386
00:40:19,708 --> 00:40:20,751
I repeat.

387
00:40:20,835 --> 00:40:25,005
Aircraft B357 which departed Incheon
and headed to Morocco last night,

388
00:40:25,089 --> 00:40:27,341
crashed down into the Moroccan seas.

389
00:40:27,425 --> 00:40:31,470
It was announced by the airline
that all 211 passengers,

390
00:40:31,554 --> 00:40:34,390
including the cabin crew,
were killed in this accident.

391
00:40:34,473 --> 00:40:37,560
The exact cause of the crash
is yet unknown,

392
00:40:37,643 --> 00:40:41,981
but speculations point to bad weather
or aircraft failure.

393
00:40:42,982 --> 00:40:46,235
Twenty children
from a taekwondo demonstration team

394
00:40:46,318 --> 00:40:49,196
were in the airplane,
invited by the Moroccan government

395
00:40:49,280 --> 00:40:53,325
to celebrate 50 years
 of diplomatic relations with Korea...

CHA HOON (MALE/11)

397
00:40:54,493 --> 00:40:56,245
...making the tragedy more devastating.
Meanwhile, the Korean government

398
00:40:56,328 --> 00:40:59,582
has not yet made an announcement
on the incident.

399
00:41:13,971 --> 00:41:15,723
President Jeong Gook-pyo

400
00:41:15,806 --> 00:41:18,058
just arrived from Busan.

401
00:41:18,142 --> 00:41:19,602
Please wait a little longer.

402
00:41:22,855 --> 00:41:26,400
Among the 211 passengers, 108 are Koreans,

403
00:41:26,484 --> 00:41:28,068
including 25 children.

404
00:41:28,527 --> 00:41:32,072
Since the accident took place overseas,
it's hard to get hold of the situation.

405
00:41:35,618 --> 00:41:37,745
I need to share a few words with you, sir.

406
00:41:37,828 --> 00:41:39,580
Welcome, Prime Minister Hong.

407
00:41:39,663 --> 00:41:41,290
Please excuse us.

408
00:41:41,373 --> 00:41:43,167
The makeup's not over yet.

409
00:41:44,502 --> 00:41:47,505
Looking a bit worn out
is preferable in this sort of event.

410
00:42:00,434 --> 00:42:05,105
They say even the falling leaves
can cause trouble in the final years.

411
00:42:05,189 --> 00:42:08,526
Look at all the troubles I'm facing
with only a year left to go.

412
00:42:08,609 --> 00:42:11,570
The aircraft that went down, B357,

413
00:42:12,279 --> 00:42:15,157
is said to be the latest model,
crafted by Dynamic System.

414
00:42:16,867 --> 00:42:20,704
It is highly possible that the crash
was caused by aircraft failure.

415
00:42:21,497 --> 00:42:23,332
Are you sure of that?

416
00:42:23,415 --> 00:42:25,918
According to the log
from the control center,

417
00:42:26,669 --> 00:42:27,878
we're 90% sure.

418
00:42:30,422 --> 00:42:34,009
But until we have a report
from the investigative team,

419
00:42:34,093 --> 00:42:38,097
I think it'll be best for us
to not take any formal position.

420
00:42:41,433 --> 00:42:45,813
I'm so thirsty.
They didn't even get me a cup of water.

421
00:42:55,322 --> 00:42:57,408
My dear fellow countrymen.

422
00:42:57,908 --> 00:43:04,248
I have never heard
more tragic news in my life.

423
00:43:07,751 --> 00:43:09,128
As the President,

424
00:43:10,546 --> 00:43:14,925
I have failed to protect our people
and keep them safe.

425
00:43:17,595 --> 00:43:18,721
And now,

426
00:43:19,597 --> 00:43:21,765
I feel so ashamed.

427
00:43:23,434 --> 00:43:26,562
To those who lost
their beloved family members,

428
00:43:27,146 --> 00:43:29,648
and to all the people

429
00:43:30,274 --> 00:43:33,694
who are sharing the pain
of this tragedy with them,

430
00:43:33,777 --> 00:43:35,362
I would like to...

431
00:43:37,197 --> 00:43:39,617
offer my sincere condolences.

432
00:44:11,732 --> 00:44:13,901
-Fasten your seat belt. Sit down.
-I will, in a minute.

433
00:44:13,984 --> 00:44:17,196
-Hoon, I told you to sit down.
-Someone's sitting in my seat.

434
00:44:17,279 --> 00:44:18,572
Wait.

435
00:44:21,283 --> 00:44:23,911
Stupid Uncle, sorry I got mad at you.

436
00:44:24,995 --> 00:44:27,289
Did you get mad at me, too?

437
00:44:29,124 --> 00:44:33,629
I know you threw away
your movies, CDs and books.

438
00:44:34,254 --> 00:44:35,964
You got busted.

439
00:44:37,549 --> 00:44:40,678
I brought them back home.
They were so heavy.

440
00:44:43,305 --> 00:44:45,307
Why did you quit the Action Center?

441
00:44:45,683 --> 00:44:48,143
You said you'd become
 a famous martial arts director

442
00:44:48,227 --> 00:44:49,770
and go to Hollywood.

443
00:44:51,730 --> 00:44:55,609
You said your new name will be Bruce Chan
 after Bruce Lee and Jackie Chan.

444
00:44:56,402 --> 00:45:00,864
You're the coolest when doing stunts.

445
00:45:02,282 --> 00:45:04,368
I want a fried egg when I get back.

446
00:45:05,035 --> 00:45:06,120
A good one.

447
00:45:06,662 --> 00:45:08,539
I want two, okay?

448
00:45:54,668 --> 00:45:55,794
Hoon...

449
00:45:56,753 --> 00:45:58,172
Hoon!

450
00:46:13,020 --> 00:46:15,314
DYNAMIC SYSTEM
APOLOGY PRESS CONFERENCE

451
00:46:15,397 --> 00:46:17,316
Who are you bowing to?

452
00:46:46,512 --> 00:46:51,225
Dynamic System, the manufacturer of B357,
held a press conference.

453
00:46:51,308 --> 00:46:54,603
And the bereaved families burst in,
causing a scene.

454
00:46:54,686 --> 00:46:57,856
While the accident is presumed
to be caused by aircraft failure,

455
00:46:57,940 --> 00:46:59,650
controversy is expected

456
00:46:59,733 --> 00:47:02,444
since Dynamic System
was scheduled to provide

457
00:47:02,528 --> 00:47:06,365
next-generation fighter jets
and receive 10.8 trillion won.

458
00:48:02,254 --> 00:48:04,131
More on the B357 incident.

459
00:48:04,214 --> 00:48:08,552
Some family members
are to head off to Morocco tonight

460
00:48:08,635 --> 00:48:11,471
on planes chartered by Dynamic System.

461
00:48:11,555 --> 00:48:14,600
Since it will be hard to collect remains
from the crash site,

462
00:48:15,267 --> 00:48:18,562
they have decided to hold a mass funeral

463
00:48:18,645 --> 00:48:21,648
on a beach near the accident site.

464
00:48:35,537 --> 00:48:37,789
It must have been a tiring trip.

465
00:48:37,873 --> 00:48:41,543
I'm Go Hae-ri
from the Korean Embassy in Morocco.

466
00:48:41,627 --> 00:48:43,295
I'm Kim Ho-sik.

467
00:48:44,546 --> 00:48:46,298
During your stay in Morocco,

468
00:48:46,381 --> 00:48:49,760
you'll be staying at the Continental Hotel
in downtown Tánger.

469
00:48:49,843 --> 00:48:53,263
There is a bus waiting for us outside,
so let's get moving.

470
00:48:53,347 --> 00:48:55,891
Excuse me, can I use the bathroom?

471
00:48:55,974 --> 00:48:59,728
Then I will meet all of you
after 10 minutes at Gate one.

472
00:49:33,970 --> 00:49:35,430
You sit there.

473
00:49:35,514 --> 00:49:37,683
What? Hey, you.

474
00:49:37,766 --> 00:49:39,059
Sit down. Put your seat belt on.

475
00:49:39,142 --> 00:49:40,268
-Hey, you.
-Quiet.

476
00:49:43,271 --> 00:49:44,481
Stupid Uncle...

477
00:49:51,113 --> 00:49:51,947
Get him!

478
00:49:53,407 --> 00:49:54,908
We are about to head off!

479
00:49:54,991 --> 00:49:55,826
Get off!

480
00:49:56,284 --> 00:49:57,119
Hey!

481
00:51:44,601 --> 00:51:45,644
It's you.

482
00:51:48,605 --> 00:51:49,815
But how did you...

483
00:52:13,296 --> 00:52:14,548
Who do you work for?

484
00:52:16,132 --> 00:52:17,050
How are you alive?

485
00:52:18,468 --> 00:52:20,220
Everyone on the plane died.

486
00:52:20,303 --> 00:52:22,138
How come you are alive?

487
00:52:25,350 --> 00:52:26,726
Was it you?

488
00:52:27,853 --> 00:52:29,646
Why did you kill my Hoon?

489
00:52:30,272 --> 00:52:32,232
Why did you crash the plane, you bastard!

490
00:52:56,047 --> 00:52:57,299
Why?

491
00:53:12,689 --> 00:53:14,357
-Come with me.
-What happened?

492
00:53:20,071 --> 00:53:22,115
Call the police, fast!

493
00:54:58,837 --> 00:55:01,756
-Eight hundred.
-Here's the money.

494
00:55:55,852 --> 00:55:56,936
Get out.

495
00:55:58,521 --> 00:56:02,776
Get out, you piece of shit!

496
00:58:42,894 --> 00:58:44,854
-Ms. Lee Pil-sun?
-Yes.

497
00:58:44,938 --> 00:58:46,648
It's the table in the middle.

498
00:58:49,150 --> 00:58:51,069
If you could just wait a bit longer,

499
00:58:51,152 --> 00:58:53,404
someone from Dynamic System
will arrive soon.

500
00:58:53,488 --> 00:58:57,450
Mr. Cha Dal-geon is not here yet.
Did you contact him?

501
00:58:58,743 --> 00:59:00,370
He is not answering.

502
00:59:00,828 --> 00:59:03,206
He knows where we're staying,
so he'll be fine.

503
00:59:53,172 --> 00:59:55,174
