1
00:01:16,201 --> 00:01:17,577
Ms. O Sang-mi!

2
00:02:04,165 --> 00:02:05,250
Who are you?

3
00:02:25,979 --> 00:02:30,400
Safe houses are usually for people
who aren't safe.

4
00:02:34,737 --> 00:02:38,408
The more beautiful the scenery,
the more troubled you become.

5
00:02:42,370 --> 00:02:43,204
ORDINARY GOVERNMENT EMPLOYEE

6
00:02:43,288 --> 00:02:44,831
I guess you weren't told.

7
00:02:45,623 --> 00:02:47,917
You're not allowed to use your phone here.

8
00:02:50,837 --> 00:02:51,671
Okay.

9
00:02:54,716 --> 00:02:58,386
NIS agents will be here
for your protection.

10
00:03:01,723 --> 00:03:05,101
Sir, when are you going
to interrogate O Sang-mi?

11
00:03:09,230 --> 00:03:11,816
It's time for you to stop.

12
00:03:12,859 --> 00:03:14,986
-Excuse me?
-Leave it to us.

13
00:03:15,904 --> 00:03:17,447
You've done enough.

14
00:03:26,039 --> 00:03:29,250
Damn, he really gets on my nerves.

15
00:03:32,128 --> 00:03:33,421
Are you here for a tour?

16
00:03:33,504 --> 00:03:36,674
You'd better not get caught
eating and drinking during night shifts.

17
00:03:36,758 --> 00:03:38,426
-Yes, sir.
-Stay focused.

18
00:03:39,886 --> 00:03:40,970
Thank you for your hard work.

19
00:03:41,054 --> 00:03:43,806
I have to say,
I'm also quite shocked by all this.

20
00:03:43,890 --> 00:03:46,935
-What's with all the chaos?
-You should have done a better job.

21
00:03:47,310 --> 00:03:48,811
You're right.

22
00:03:49,562 --> 00:03:53,650
By the way, did something happen
to my boss at the Blue House?

23
00:03:54,484 --> 00:03:57,946
I mean, nobody was fired,
and the office is in total chaos.

24
00:04:35,733 --> 00:04:37,610
-What are you doing here?
-What do you think?

25
00:04:37,694 --> 00:04:39,946
I'm here to protect Your Highness.

26
00:04:42,532 --> 00:04:44,033
Are you wondering why I wasn't fired?

27
00:04:44,575 --> 00:04:48,288
I told you, I can't be fired
because I'm a special agent.

28
00:04:48,371 --> 00:04:49,497
I'm that important.

29
00:04:51,666 --> 00:04:52,667
What about O Sang-mi?

30
00:04:52,917 --> 00:04:56,629
She's probably singing like a canary now.
An expert is handling her.

31
00:04:59,173 --> 00:05:00,508
Anyway, bravo.

32
00:05:00,925 --> 00:05:03,845
Breaking into the Blue House
to meet the president?

33
00:05:05,471 --> 00:05:08,182
Thumbs-up to you, Cha Dal-goen.

34
00:05:09,517 --> 00:05:12,186
The security guys came at me,

35
00:05:12,270 --> 00:05:15,940
and I managed to handle 15 of them.

36
00:05:16,024 --> 00:05:17,984
But once there were about 30 of them,

37
00:05:18,067 --> 00:05:20,153
all of them martial artists,

38
00:05:20,236 --> 00:05:21,487
it was just too much, even for me.

39
00:05:21,571 --> 00:05:23,489
Wow, 30 of them?

40
00:05:23,573 --> 00:05:25,199
That's right.

41
00:05:25,867 --> 00:05:28,286
I didn't want to scare you,
but there were more.

42
00:05:28,369 --> 00:05:30,580
-Really?
-Hell yeah.

43
00:05:30,663 --> 00:05:31,956
Where are you, Go Hae-ri?

44
00:05:32,040 --> 00:05:33,374
I'm coming!

45
00:05:33,958 --> 00:05:34,834
Hey.

46
00:05:37,628 --> 00:05:38,629
God of war.

47
00:05:40,048 --> 00:05:41,049
Nice!

48
00:05:41,341 --> 00:05:42,759
Hey, Hae-ri go, stop it.

49
00:05:43,134 --> 00:05:44,677
Amazing!

50
00:05:53,311 --> 00:05:55,938
She's been still like that for an hour.

51
00:05:59,275 --> 00:06:01,027
She's being cautious.

52
00:06:01,110 --> 00:06:02,945
She has a lot to hide.

53
00:06:04,364 --> 00:06:05,281
Hello.

54
00:06:06,074 --> 00:06:07,909
-Hello, sir.
-Don't get up.

55
00:06:08,576 --> 00:06:09,702
How's she doing?

56
00:06:10,286 --> 00:06:12,580
Considering she's probably
never been interrogated,

57
00:06:12,830 --> 00:06:15,291
-she's surprisingly calm.
-I wasn't talking to you.

58
00:06:17,585 --> 00:06:20,338
She hasn't said a single thing, sir.

59
00:06:49,617 --> 00:06:52,620
You should have one.
You're gonna need some energy.

60
00:06:54,997 --> 00:06:56,999
Why exactly did you bring me here?

61
00:06:57,291 --> 00:06:59,001
You're here as a witness...

62
00:06:59,710 --> 00:07:01,170
so relax.

63
00:07:01,254 --> 00:07:03,756
The plane exploded and crashed.

64
00:07:05,007 --> 00:07:09,762
Do you think anyone
could possibly have survived the crash?

65
00:07:09,846 --> 00:07:11,889
You'll get two billion won
in compensation,

66
00:07:11,973 --> 00:07:14,308
and five billion
from the life insurance payout.

67
00:07:14,392 --> 00:07:17,478
Not to mention the money
he was promised for crashing the plane.

68
00:07:19,397 --> 00:07:21,107
Even I wouldn't have been able
to die so easily.

69
00:07:24,193 --> 00:07:26,612
Okay, let's say he's alive...

70
00:07:28,197 --> 00:07:29,949
I still had nothing to do with it.

71
00:07:36,747 --> 00:07:40,209
Your husband was on the phone
with the terrorist right before takeoff.

72
00:07:40,543 --> 00:07:41,961
You're wrong.

73
00:07:43,045 --> 00:07:44,630
He was on the phone with me.

74
00:07:46,757 --> 00:07:48,134
Do you want to know what we talked about?

75
00:07:51,137 --> 00:07:54,974
It was an intimate conversation
between me and my husband.

76
00:07:55,349 --> 00:08:00,313
Your number was not in his call history.

77
00:08:00,646 --> 00:08:02,106
How do you explain that?

78
00:08:13,075 --> 00:08:14,160
Answer the question.

79
00:08:14,869 --> 00:08:16,454
If that really was you on the phone,

80
00:08:17,079 --> 00:08:18,498
you should be able to speak Spanish.

81
00:08:24,170 --> 00:08:26,005
Of course there's no record.

82
00:08:27,548 --> 00:08:32,887
We used a burner phone
to avoid loan sharks.

83
00:08:35,640 --> 00:08:39,185
Didn't you do a background check on her
before the interrogation?

84
00:08:39,936 --> 00:08:42,813
-Did you not know she could speak Spanish?
-I'm sorry, sir.

85
00:08:44,232 --> 00:08:46,108
I won't even bother with you.

86
00:08:46,192 --> 00:08:48,277
But what's wrong with Gi?
He's supposed to be good!

87
00:08:51,364 --> 00:08:54,408
You guys wanted to interrogate her,
so you'd better figure it out.

88
00:08:54,492 --> 00:08:55,660
Do whatever it takes!

89
00:09:00,748 --> 00:09:04,252
I told him she could speak Spanish.

90
00:09:04,919 --> 00:09:06,546
What's up with him?

91
00:09:07,296 --> 00:09:09,632
-It's his strategy.
-"Strategy"?

92
00:09:10,508 --> 00:09:11,884
But, sir...

93
00:09:11,968 --> 00:09:14,220
are we keeping this from the director?

94
00:09:15,304 --> 00:09:17,139
There's a mole in the NIS.

95
00:09:17,848 --> 00:09:19,183
We can't be too careful.

96
00:09:19,475 --> 00:09:20,351
Really?

97
00:09:37,535 --> 00:09:40,830
You should have one.
Seems like you need it more than I do.

98
00:09:47,545 --> 00:09:48,879
Kim Woo-gi is in Morocco, isn't he?

99
00:09:53,050 --> 00:09:55,261
He's probably really nervous right now...

100
00:09:57,305 --> 00:09:59,181
not knowing what information
you might give away.

101
00:10:01,267 --> 00:10:02,143
What are you talking--?

102
00:10:02,226 --> 00:10:04,895
I'm sure he received at least
ten billion won from John & Mark.

103
00:10:06,230 --> 00:10:08,190
I get it.

104
00:10:08,524 --> 00:10:12,194
You need to protect him...
in order to get that money.

105
00:10:15,948 --> 00:10:17,450
My husband is dead.

106
00:10:19,785 --> 00:10:21,203
He's dead.

107
00:10:26,375 --> 00:10:27,710
Let her go.

108
00:10:29,879 --> 00:10:31,088
But, sir...

109
00:10:31,505 --> 00:10:33,049
Do you believe her?

110
00:10:35,801 --> 00:10:38,429
I'm not done here.
I'll take full responsibility--

111
00:10:38,512 --> 00:10:40,640
Director's orders. Don't make a scene.

112
00:11:03,245 --> 00:11:05,289
What does that have to do with anything?

113
00:11:05,456 --> 00:11:07,792
It's not an easy place to break into.
It'll be dangerous.

114
00:11:10,002 --> 00:11:12,421
So it's dangerous for me,
but not for the other guy?

115
00:11:16,425 --> 00:11:17,843
Who is it?

116
00:11:19,136 --> 00:11:21,389
Who's the asshole
that stole my client from me?

117
00:11:24,517 --> 00:11:27,478
Someone deadly and very brutal.

118
00:11:36,612 --> 00:11:39,699
-Done!
-This is pissing me off.

119
00:11:39,782 --> 00:11:40,950
Thank you, sir.

120
00:11:44,787 --> 00:11:46,956
How is this 1,200,000 won?

121
00:11:47,039 --> 00:11:48,541
UNCLE

122
00:11:50,584 --> 00:11:51,877
Yes, I'm listening.

123
00:11:54,296 --> 00:11:55,798
I've already started working on it.

124
00:12:08,269 --> 00:12:09,895
Cha Dal-geon seems to be sleeping.

125
00:12:10,438 --> 00:12:12,440
Let him be.
He'll wake up when he's hungry.

126
00:12:12,523 --> 00:12:14,191
Come and eat your black bean noodles.

127
00:12:14,275 --> 00:12:15,860
I had a late lunch.

128
00:12:15,943 --> 00:12:18,738
-We'll have it.
-I never said I wasn't going to eat. Move.

129
00:12:18,821 --> 00:12:20,698
Come on.

130
00:12:21,323 --> 00:12:22,241
Man.

131
00:12:22,742 --> 00:12:23,659
Gosh.

132
00:12:25,578 --> 00:12:27,955
Are we allowed
to have food delivered here?

133
00:12:28,038 --> 00:12:31,167
Why shouldn't we be?
The delivery flyer was already here.

134
00:12:31,250 --> 00:12:33,627
The guards also have food delivered.

135
00:12:36,505 --> 00:12:38,382
It won't take too much effort.

136
00:12:39,759 --> 00:12:42,011
Don't worry about the NIS bastards.

137
00:12:42,928 --> 00:12:44,388
I'll just kill Cha Dal-geon.

138
00:12:49,643 --> 00:12:50,644
Are you ready?

139
00:12:51,604 --> 00:12:53,981
I thought you'd never ask.

140
00:12:54,690 --> 00:12:57,026
Go get the empty plates...

141
00:12:59,278 --> 00:13:01,071
along with Cha Dal-geon's head.

142
00:13:18,839 --> 00:13:20,299
I'm here to collect the plates.

143
00:13:21,801 --> 00:13:23,177
-Just a second.
-Okay.

144
00:14:44,925 --> 00:14:46,302
My head is killing me.

145
00:14:46,802 --> 00:14:48,304
Maybe I have food poisoning.

146
00:15:08,365 --> 00:15:09,366
You are...

147
00:15:37,478 --> 00:15:38,979
Where are you?

148
00:15:41,565 --> 00:15:45,736
I guess you didn't even have
a single bite of the black bean noodles.

149
00:15:49,114 --> 00:15:50,407
Weren't you hungry?

150
00:15:54,411 --> 00:15:57,164
You should've ordered
spicy noodles instead.

151
00:17:10,362 --> 00:17:12,823
Is your head made of stone?

152
00:17:12,906 --> 00:17:14,450
It's fucking hard.

153
00:17:16,493 --> 00:17:18,412
Goodbye, stonehead.

154
00:17:50,611 --> 00:17:51,487
Is he dead?

155
00:17:54,823 --> 00:17:55,866
Dal-geon...

156
00:17:57,076 --> 00:17:58,535
check to see if he's dead.

157
00:18:36,532 --> 00:18:37,366
CALL HISTORY
UNCLE

158
00:18:39,660 --> 00:18:42,412
Did I kill him? Really?

159
00:18:42,788 --> 00:18:44,790
-Dal-geon--
-Be quiet.

160
00:18:57,302 --> 00:18:58,512
Aren't you going to answer it?

161
00:18:59,179 --> 00:19:00,055
Pardon?

162
00:19:01,515 --> 00:19:02,558
Oh, right.

163
00:19:06,562 --> 00:19:08,355
Okay, tell me what happened.

164
00:19:09,857 --> 00:19:12,484
Did you get it done in time?

165
00:19:20,033 --> 00:19:22,161
Answer me, you idiot.

166
00:19:29,960 --> 00:19:31,879
What the heck are you saying?

167
00:19:32,379 --> 00:19:34,214
This line is bad. Call me back.

168
00:19:38,635 --> 00:19:39,887
Who was that?

169
00:19:40,679 --> 00:19:41,555
Fuck.

170
00:19:43,432 --> 00:19:45,267
He sounded exactly like Min Jae-sik.

171
00:19:46,560 --> 00:19:47,477
Min Jae-sik?

172
00:19:50,522 --> 00:19:51,565
M?

173
00:19:58,488 --> 00:19:59,656
Who's M?

174
00:19:59,740 --> 00:20:01,909
-Answer it.
-Hey, Go Hae-ri.

175
00:20:01,992 --> 00:20:03,118
Yes, chief.

176
00:20:19,259 --> 00:20:21,803
-What are you doing?
-Sending a text to reassure him.

177
00:20:26,099 --> 00:20:27,726
I KILLED CHA DAL...

178
00:20:28,936 --> 00:20:31,271
You're such an amateur.

179
00:20:35,776 --> 00:20:38,111
-Lie down on the floor.
-What?

180
00:20:39,905 --> 00:20:42,991
-Lie down.
-Hey, you're scaring me.

181
00:20:43,075 --> 00:20:45,285
I'm not going to jump you. Do it now.

182
00:20:49,331 --> 00:20:50,290
Why?

183
00:20:51,500 --> 00:20:52,542
Is something wrong?

184
00:20:52,626 --> 00:20:53,794
No.

185
00:20:55,295 --> 00:20:57,506
GONG-CHEOL

186
00:21:00,175 --> 00:21:02,844
He's dead... Cha Dal-geon.

187
00:21:04,471 --> 00:21:07,224
-Are you sure?
-I have proof. Would you like to see?

188
00:21:07,766 --> 00:21:10,269
Goodness, where are my manners?

189
00:21:10,936 --> 00:21:13,188
It's too gruesome for a lady to--

190
00:21:22,239 --> 00:21:23,615
What about O Sang-mi?

191
00:21:24,574 --> 00:21:25,617
Don't worry.

192
00:21:26,034 --> 00:21:29,663
She's doing what we told her to do.

193
00:21:42,676 --> 00:21:43,760
How are you?

194
00:21:47,889 --> 00:21:50,058
I heard you're fluent in Spanish.

195
00:21:51,685 --> 00:21:56,356
You're the person Kim Woo-gi talked to,
on the phoneac right before takeoff.

196
00:22:03,780 --> 00:22:04,906
Who are you?

197
00:22:05,324 --> 00:22:08,827
How can I explain who I am
in a way that you'd understand?

198
00:22:10,120 --> 00:22:13,081
Well... let's just say
I'm from John & Mark.

199
00:22:15,709 --> 00:22:21,340
There's a detailed set of instructions
for you to follow in here.

200
00:22:21,423 --> 00:22:23,467
Learn this thoroughly and do as it says.

201
00:22:23,884 --> 00:22:28,722
Then you'll be able to get through
the NIS interrogation.

202
00:22:34,770 --> 00:22:37,356
If John & Mark want my cooperation...

203
00:22:38,482 --> 00:22:40,067
it won't be cheap.

204
00:22:40,150 --> 00:22:44,863
You can talk about the details
with a professional later.

205
00:22:45,364 --> 00:22:48,408
Memorize everything
before you go to the NIS.

206
00:22:48,492 --> 00:22:51,119
There's no use putting it off.

207
00:22:57,876 --> 00:23:00,420
I put a GPS tracking device in it.

208
00:23:13,975 --> 00:23:15,811
Thank you for your cooperation.

209
00:23:30,367 --> 00:23:32,327
I hope we never meet
for something like this again.

210
00:23:33,829 --> 00:23:34,704
Come this way.

211
00:23:53,682 --> 00:23:54,975
Where to?

212
00:23:55,058 --> 00:23:57,310
-Just circle around the downtown area.
-Come again?

213
00:23:58,478 --> 00:24:01,440
Circle around downtown. I'll pay you.

214
00:24:02,941 --> 00:24:04,025
Yes, ma'am.

215
00:24:05,777 --> 00:24:07,863
She suspects that someone's tailing her.

216
00:24:10,365 --> 00:24:13,785
She was quite something
in the interrogation too.

217
00:24:14,619 --> 00:24:16,621
Maybe she's always been like that.

218
00:24:17,456 --> 00:24:21,168
Or she's getting help
from someone on the inside.

219
00:25:02,584 --> 00:25:04,503
GO HAE-RI

220
00:25:05,587 --> 00:25:07,964
O Sang-mi is getting into another cab.

221
00:25:10,550 --> 00:25:11,384
Tell me her location.

222
00:25:18,850 --> 00:25:19,684
What?

223
00:25:20,393 --> 00:25:21,603
Are you alone?

224
00:25:24,439 --> 00:25:25,273
What is it?

225
00:25:25,690 --> 00:25:28,485
I think Min Jae-sik is the mole.

226
00:25:30,070 --> 00:25:31,154
What do you mean?

227
00:25:35,033 --> 00:25:36,868
Get it together and talk to me.

228
00:25:43,542 --> 00:25:45,502
Go Hae-ri, listen very carefully.

229
00:25:46,211 --> 00:25:47,045
Yes.

230
00:25:48,213 --> 00:25:49,214
Okay, sir.

231
00:25:53,510 --> 00:25:55,095
Get him out of here.

232
00:25:57,389 --> 00:25:58,390
By myself?

233
00:26:06,648 --> 00:26:10,360
These men work for Chief Min.

234
00:26:14,281 --> 00:26:17,826
If we want to fool them,
I have to be here when they wake up.

235
00:26:49,316 --> 00:26:51,610
I need you to go and meet Chief Gang.

236
00:26:53,778 --> 00:26:55,196
You can trust him.

237
00:26:55,572 --> 00:26:57,782
I'm Cha Dal-geon.
Did you get Hae-ri's call?

238
00:27:19,220 --> 00:27:21,014
Min Jae-sik, you son of a bitch!

239
00:27:21,931 --> 00:27:22,766
Do you know this guy?

240
00:27:25,435 --> 00:27:26,353
It's none of your business.

241
00:27:27,937 --> 00:27:28,813
Hey, wait!

242
00:27:29,564 --> 00:27:31,650
You've come this far because of me.

243
00:27:31,941 --> 00:27:33,943
Shouldn't you let me in on this?

244
00:27:37,072 --> 00:27:38,573
You want to leave me out?

245
00:27:39,616 --> 00:27:40,575
Okay, fine.

246
00:27:41,534 --> 00:27:43,828
I'm going to deliver this body to the DA.

247
00:27:45,580 --> 00:27:46,414
Unkillable.

248
00:27:49,042 --> 00:27:49,959
Unkillable?

249
00:27:50,043 --> 00:27:52,796
It's a secret organization
of North Korean defectors

250
00:27:52,879 --> 00:27:54,005
who used to be in the special forces.

251
00:27:54,714 --> 00:27:56,633
What can we do?

252
00:27:56,716 --> 00:27:59,552
South and North Korea signed
an economic cooperation treaty.

253
00:27:59,636 --> 00:28:03,098
Unkillable is like a cancerous tumor now.

254
00:28:03,181 --> 00:28:04,933
You should've disbanded them.

255
00:28:05,475 --> 00:28:07,143
Why send them to get killed?

256
00:28:07,227 --> 00:28:09,896
If word got out that defectors
were being used for black ops,

257
00:28:09,979 --> 00:28:11,606
who'd take the blame?

258
00:28:11,690 --> 00:28:13,066
You? Me?

259
00:28:13,149 --> 00:28:14,734
The director?

260
00:28:15,026 --> 00:28:15,944
Come on.

261
00:28:16,444 --> 00:28:18,405
North Korea's State Security Department

262
00:28:18,488 --> 00:28:21,116
was very happy to get the list of names.

263
00:28:21,199 --> 00:28:25,453
In order to get closer to unification,
we need to offer a sacrifice.

264
00:28:27,664 --> 00:28:29,207
Unkillable was disbanded,

265
00:28:29,290 --> 00:28:30,750
but Min Jae-sik must have
got them together again.

266
00:28:33,795 --> 00:28:35,463
Then it's confirmed, right?

267
00:28:36,464 --> 00:28:38,925
That asshole Min Jae-sik
is working with John & Mark.

268
00:28:51,354 --> 00:28:53,022
GO HAE-RI

269
00:28:57,318 --> 00:28:58,153
What is it?

270
00:28:59,154 --> 00:29:01,406
It's bad news, sir.
Cha Dal-geon has gone missing.

271
00:29:01,489 --> 00:29:02,365
What?

272
00:29:02,949 --> 00:29:05,076
What the fuck were you doing?

273
00:29:05,160 --> 00:29:08,413
We kind of passed out
after we had some black bean noodles.

274
00:29:08,997 --> 00:29:10,331
When we woke up...

275
00:29:10,415 --> 00:29:12,375
Oh, there's blood spatter here...

276
00:29:13,126 --> 00:29:14,961
I think an assassin broke in.

277
00:29:15,837 --> 00:29:17,213
Good work.

278
00:29:17,297 --> 00:29:21,092
Get Hae-ri out of there,
and then delete the security footage.

279
00:29:22,802 --> 00:29:24,179
It's already taken care of.

280
00:29:24,929 --> 00:29:28,057
That son of a bitch knows what he's doing.

281
00:29:29,684 --> 00:29:30,977
Make sure Hae-ri doesn't talk.

282
00:29:31,060 --> 00:29:33,229
Tell her I'll report this
to the director myself.

283
00:29:37,984 --> 00:29:39,110
Good.

284
00:29:39,194 --> 00:29:41,696
This is how you get things done.

285
00:29:42,280 --> 00:29:43,114
MR. KIM

286
00:29:45,325 --> 00:29:47,827
-Yes, sir.
-Where's O Sang-mi?

287
00:29:48,328 --> 00:29:50,497
Her ass is right in front of me.

288
00:29:51,164 --> 00:29:53,458
Don't waste any more time. Bring her in.

289
00:29:53,541 --> 00:29:54,709
You got it.

290
00:29:56,586 --> 00:29:57,420
Turn left.

291
00:30:02,008 --> 00:30:03,009
What the fuck?

292
00:30:03,384 --> 00:30:05,220
Let me follow him and cut his throat.

293
00:30:05,678 --> 00:30:06,763
Let him go.

294
00:30:07,055 --> 00:30:08,681
He's one lucky son of a bitch.

295
00:30:09,390 --> 00:30:10,391
How far away is the target?

296
00:30:10,975 --> 00:30:12,185
About a mile.

297
00:30:12,519 --> 00:30:13,812
Something's not right.

298
00:30:13,895 --> 00:30:15,897
-Go faster.
-Okay.

299
00:30:33,998 --> 00:30:37,001
O Sang-mi went into a church
near Hagye Station.

300
00:30:37,293 --> 00:30:39,087
Let me hear her.

301
00:30:39,504 --> 00:30:40,421
Yes, sir.

302
00:31:17,792 --> 00:31:19,711
THE TRUTH LIES IN O SANG-MI'S HANDS
CAN SHE CLEAR THE SUSPICIONS?

303
00:31:21,504 --> 00:31:24,257
THE NIS IS INVESTIGATING...
HE IS SUSPECTED TO HAVE USED...

304
00:31:33,892 --> 00:31:37,145
GAIN THE SKIES
WITH THE PRAYERS OF OTHERS

305
00:31:42,650 --> 00:31:45,445
Is it okay for you to call?
Aren't you under investigation?

306
00:31:46,070 --> 00:31:48,781
Don't worry,
everything has been taken care of.

307
00:31:49,949 --> 00:31:52,243
What do you mean? How?

308
00:31:52,660 --> 00:31:55,496
We're not the only ones
who don't want the truth to get out.

309
00:31:56,706 --> 00:32:01,294
Don't tell me you trust
those people from John & Mark.

310
00:32:07,342 --> 00:32:11,346
You know me.
The only thing I trust is money.

311
00:32:11,763 --> 00:32:13,806
Did John & Mark pay you everything?

312
00:32:18,102 --> 00:32:20,480
Did you record what she just said?

313
00:32:21,439 --> 00:32:24,025
Of course. Every single word, sir.

314
00:32:25,944 --> 00:32:27,946
I'll get the rest when the time's right.

315
00:32:28,446 --> 00:32:30,073
Don't you turn your back on me.

316
00:32:30,657 --> 00:32:32,909
You'll only get the five billion
if I'm still alive.

317
00:32:33,117 --> 00:32:34,827
Things have gone too far.

318
00:32:35,411 --> 00:32:38,081
I need more than just five billion.

319
00:32:53,763 --> 00:32:54,847
Hang in there.

320
00:32:55,264 --> 00:32:57,350
The longer we stall,
the more money we'll get.

321
00:32:58,059 --> 00:33:00,186
They're more nervous than we are.

322
00:33:26,212 --> 00:33:27,380
Get off me!

323
00:33:29,465 --> 00:33:30,591
Get off me!

324
00:33:31,009 --> 00:33:32,301
Get off me!

325
00:33:32,635 --> 00:33:33,636
Shit.

326
00:33:44,814 --> 00:33:45,940
How did it go?

327
00:33:46,941 --> 00:33:49,402
I have what we need to find Kim Woo-gi.

328
00:33:50,611 --> 00:33:51,571
Be more specific.

329
00:33:52,864 --> 00:33:53,740
It's a burner phone.

330
00:33:54,490 --> 00:33:56,826
They've been using it
to talk to each other.

331
00:34:04,417 --> 00:34:05,418
Hello?

332
00:34:06,127 --> 00:34:07,211
Gi Tae-ung?

333
00:34:21,392 --> 00:34:22,310
Get her out.

334
00:34:42,789 --> 00:34:45,750
Hello? Gi Tae-ung?

335
00:34:47,335 --> 00:34:49,295
Gi Tae-ung, what's wrong?

336
00:34:51,172 --> 00:34:53,174
Gi Tae-ung! What's going on?

337
00:34:53,257 --> 00:34:54,509
CHIEF GANG

338
00:34:57,303 --> 00:35:01,808
Mr. Gang, I just got a report
about a car accident

339
00:35:02,266 --> 00:35:04,393
right where we lost Mr. Gi.

340
00:35:05,394 --> 00:35:06,562
A car accident?

341
00:35:07,355 --> 00:35:08,272
Damn it.

342
00:35:10,983 --> 00:35:12,568
Send me the location.

343
00:35:13,027 --> 00:35:15,196
And find out where the director is.

344
00:35:16,489 --> 00:35:18,324
He's not at home, and I can't reach him.

345
00:35:18,407 --> 00:35:20,409
-Hurry!
-Yes, sir.

346
00:35:23,037 --> 00:35:23,955
Pull over!

347
00:35:32,547 --> 00:35:34,132
Isn't that Cha Dal-geon?

348
00:35:43,349 --> 00:35:44,183
GONG-CHEOL

349
00:35:47,353 --> 00:35:48,312
BIG BROTHER

350
00:35:49,730 --> 00:35:50,606
It's Unkillable.

351
00:35:54,318 --> 00:35:55,153
Don't answer it.

352
00:35:59,115 --> 00:36:02,201
The person you are trying to reach...

353
00:36:09,417 --> 00:36:10,751
ANSWER THE PHONE, CHA DAL-GEON.

354
00:36:16,757 --> 00:36:17,884
They know.

355
00:36:26,934 --> 00:36:27,935
Answer it, then.

356
00:36:28,603 --> 00:36:30,271
BIG BROTHER

357
00:36:32,773 --> 00:36:34,192
What did you do to Gong-Cheol?

358
00:36:36,444 --> 00:36:38,738
Answer the question. Where is he?

359
00:36:42,241 --> 00:36:44,577
Where do you think bad guys end up?

360
00:36:45,786 --> 00:36:47,788
In hell, obviously.

361
00:36:48,289 --> 00:36:49,498
You son of a bitch.

362
00:36:50,750 --> 00:36:52,585
Don't forget my voice.

363
00:36:54,420 --> 00:36:55,880
I'll personally slit your throat.

364
00:36:59,217 --> 00:37:00,051
Do Su!

365
00:37:01,719 --> 00:37:03,262
You're Kim Do Su, right?

366
00:37:04,055 --> 00:37:05,264
It's me, Gang Ju-cheol.

367
00:37:06,474 --> 00:37:07,600
Fucking traitor.

368
00:37:12,396 --> 00:37:13,773
UNCLE

369
00:37:31,916 --> 00:37:33,084
Min Jae-sik?

370
00:37:33,417 --> 00:37:37,004
Yes, Dal-geon just warned me
that Min may know.

371
00:37:37,588 --> 00:37:38,631
Find his location.

372
00:37:39,632 --> 00:37:41,050
-Oka--
-It's urgent. Hurry.

373
00:37:41,133 --> 00:37:43,594
Okay, okay. Everybody's in a hurry today.

374
00:37:49,558 --> 00:37:50,559
I've found him.

375
00:37:54,230 --> 00:37:57,566
He's in the Gangnam nightlife district.

376
00:37:58,567 --> 00:37:59,694
Send me the coordinates.

377
00:38:16,127 --> 00:38:18,754
-Se-hun, are you okay?
-Please get out of the way.

378
00:38:20,006 --> 00:38:21,841
Gi Tae-ung! Do you recognize me?

379
00:38:22,633 --> 00:38:23,509
Tae-ung!

380
00:38:24,302 --> 00:38:25,219
Chief...

381
00:38:26,887 --> 00:38:27,847
Where's O Sang-mi?

382
00:38:29,598 --> 00:38:31,892
Move over.
Come on, move him now!

383
00:38:56,917 --> 00:38:57,752
Excuse me.

384
00:38:59,503 --> 00:39:00,755
Isn't this O Sang-mi's burner phone?

385
00:39:03,007 --> 00:39:04,258
You're right.

386
00:39:04,342 --> 00:39:07,386
Those bastards didn't know she had it.

387
00:39:08,304 --> 00:39:09,221
Fucking bastards.

388
00:39:18,189 --> 00:39:20,524
-Yes, Mr. Gang.
-What happened to Min Jae-sik?

389
00:39:21,650 --> 00:39:22,526
I found him.

390
00:39:23,694 --> 00:39:24,570
How's Gi?

391
00:39:26,030 --> 00:39:28,449
He's been taken to a hospital.
Where are you?

392
00:39:29,158 --> 00:39:30,409
I'm in Gangnam.

393
00:39:30,493 --> 00:39:32,828
Min will soon find out.

394
00:39:33,996 --> 00:39:36,624
We need to arrest him before he gets away.
Can you do it by yourself?

395
00:39:37,333 --> 00:39:38,459
Don't worry.

396
00:39:41,295 --> 00:39:42,421
I have a gun.

397
00:39:43,506 --> 00:39:47,385
I'll take full responsibility.
If he resists, just shoot him.

398
00:39:49,387 --> 00:39:51,347
-Sir?
-O Sang-mi was taken.

399
00:39:52,681 --> 00:39:55,101
What happened to Tae-ung
wasn't an accident.

400
00:39:55,184 --> 00:39:57,186
Mi Jae-sik is responsible.

401
00:39:59,063 --> 00:40:00,981
That bastard isn't even human...

402
00:40:02,233 --> 00:40:04,527
so kill him if you need to.

403
00:40:29,135 --> 00:40:32,138
Hey, miss, you can't just barge in here!

404
00:40:32,221 --> 00:40:34,223
I'm looking for my husband.
Get out of my way.

405
00:40:36,434 --> 00:40:37,810
How was it, sir?

406
00:40:38,018 --> 00:40:39,854
Did you blow off some steam?

407
00:40:42,398 --> 00:40:45,943
The president called me three times today.

408
00:40:47,945 --> 00:40:49,822
If I don't close this case soon,

409
00:40:50,781 --> 00:40:51,907
I might get fired.

410
00:40:51,991 --> 00:40:56,954
That's why I brought you here.
I wanted to cheer you up.

411
00:40:57,413 --> 00:40:58,789
Have another drink,

412
00:40:59,498 --> 00:41:01,625
then go home and get some rest.

413
00:41:03,377 --> 00:41:05,296
Excuse me, sir, let me get this.

414
00:41:07,173 --> 00:41:08,257
MR. KIM

415
00:41:10,092 --> 00:41:11,177
Hey, Kim.

416
00:41:11,719 --> 00:41:13,387
I'm busy right now, so--

417
00:41:13,471 --> 00:41:14,972
Gong-Cheol's dead.

418
00:41:15,306 --> 00:41:18,976
We're going to lay low with O Sang-mi.
You need to get out too.

419
00:41:19,059 --> 00:41:20,603
Fuck!

420
00:41:24,523 --> 00:41:25,941
What the...?

421
00:41:26,400 --> 00:41:28,611
What are you doing here?

422
00:41:33,741 --> 00:41:34,950
What the...?

423
00:41:35,951 --> 00:41:37,703
You're under arrest...

424
00:41:39,288 --> 00:41:40,998
for covering up the B357 crash
and abetting a murder.

425
00:41:42,416 --> 00:41:43,501
What the fuck are you doing?

426
00:41:43,751 --> 00:41:49,298
He sent a hitman to the safe house
to kill Cha Dal-geon.

427
00:41:50,883 --> 00:41:51,967
What's she talking about?

428
00:41:52,343 --> 00:41:56,680
He also attempted to kill Gi Tae-ung--

429
00:41:56,764 --> 00:42:00,059
-Go Hae-ri!
-If you move, I'll shot.

430
00:42:01,101 --> 00:42:02,978
What? You'll shoot me?

431
00:42:04,355 --> 00:42:07,066
I'm your direct supervisor.

432
00:42:07,149 --> 00:42:09,109
What you heard is a fucking rumor.

433
00:42:09,485 --> 00:42:11,028
You destroyed the video...

434
00:42:11,904 --> 00:42:13,030
and betrayed your colleagues.

435
00:42:14,657 --> 00:42:17,868
How much did John & Mark fucking give you?

436
00:42:19,286 --> 00:42:21,705
God, what a pain in the ass.

437
00:42:21,789 --> 00:42:23,374
You have three daughters.

438
00:42:24,208 --> 00:42:27,962
Does your dirty money
make your family happy?

439
00:42:28,420 --> 00:42:30,798
-Put the gun down and let's talk.
-I'm not kidding!

440
00:42:33,884 --> 00:42:37,054
I will shoot you, son of a bitch!

441
00:42:42,851 --> 00:42:44,436
GANG JU-CHEOL

442
00:42:45,563 --> 00:42:46,647
Yes, Gang.

443
00:43:00,744 --> 00:43:02,830
Sir, where are you?

444
00:43:08,085 --> 00:43:08,919
Fuck.

445
00:43:37,323 --> 00:43:38,699
Are you sober now?

446
00:43:39,366 --> 00:43:41,327
Yes. How's Gi Tae-ung?

447
00:43:43,037 --> 00:43:46,582
The doctor told me that he'll live
and that we don't need to worry.

448
00:43:48,167 --> 00:43:49,168
Thank God.

449
00:43:51,545 --> 00:43:52,880
What about Min Jae-sik?

450
00:43:54,423 --> 00:43:56,216
He's disappeared. His phone is off too.

451
00:43:56,925 --> 00:43:58,677
The police are helping us find him...

452
00:43:59,678 --> 00:44:01,138
so we'll know soon enough.

453
00:44:02,014 --> 00:44:04,016
It won't be easy to find him.

454
00:44:08,395 --> 00:44:09,897
Damn it.

455
00:44:15,277 --> 00:44:16,362
Shit.

456
00:44:17,655 --> 00:44:18,530
Damn.

457
00:44:31,085 --> 00:44:32,127
Mr. Min?

458
00:44:39,218 --> 00:44:41,387
You're Chief Min Jae-sik, right?

459
00:44:43,555 --> 00:44:44,390
Who are you?

460
00:44:45,224 --> 00:44:46,058
Here.

461
00:44:47,893 --> 00:44:49,269
It's for you.

462
00:44:53,190 --> 00:44:54,775
This is Min--

463
00:44:57,611 --> 00:45:01,573
Min Jae-sik isn't as bold as he looks.

464
00:45:03,534 --> 00:45:08,330
He'd never do something like this
unless he had someone to protect him.

465
00:45:11,083 --> 00:45:13,585
Are you saying someone's helping him?

466
00:45:16,588 --> 00:45:19,049
Let me lead the investigation.

467
00:45:20,092 --> 00:45:24,054
I will find an answer to every question,
from Kim Woo-gi to Min Jae-sik.

468
00:45:27,683 --> 00:45:30,477
-What if you fail?
-You don't like me, do you?

469
00:45:30,561 --> 00:45:31,603
I'll resign.

470
00:45:32,187 --> 00:45:34,898
I don't care if you resign or not.

471
00:45:36,358 --> 00:45:38,360
I'll probably get fired before that.

472
00:45:39,737 --> 00:45:41,321
We found a smoking gun.

473
00:45:43,949 --> 00:45:44,783
A smoking gun?

474
00:45:49,288 --> 00:45:52,541
We'll be able to find Kim Woo-gi soon.

475
00:45:54,835 --> 00:45:57,963
From my experience, everything we do
from this point on is very crucial.

476
00:45:58,922 --> 00:46:02,468
People who lack experience
often fail to catch their prey.

477
00:46:10,434 --> 00:46:12,978
Go ahead. I'll give you full authority.

478
00:46:14,563 --> 00:46:16,690
But if you fail,
your resignation won't be enough.

479
00:46:33,457 --> 00:46:34,625
Is he still unconscious?

480
00:46:36,627 --> 00:46:38,545
He's just sleeping.
They gave him some painkillers.

481
00:46:47,888 --> 00:46:50,599
I ran all the way here,
and the wind got in my eyes.

482
00:46:52,976 --> 00:46:54,561
Don't worry about Min Jae-sik.

483
00:46:54,645 --> 00:46:56,563
There's an APB out on him.
We'll catch him soon enough.

484
00:47:30,806 --> 00:47:31,640
Excuse me...

485
00:47:32,432 --> 00:47:34,101
you're not my type.

486
00:47:34,726 --> 00:47:37,855
I like tall, intelligent,
fair-skinned men.

487
00:47:47,114 --> 00:47:48,782
She's got no taste.

488
00:47:50,117 --> 00:47:53,787
He looks like a weasel with a bad temper.

489
00:47:56,665 --> 00:47:58,584
Dal-geon, you must be hungry...

490
00:48:30,365 --> 00:48:31,325
Oh, no.

491
00:48:33,535 --> 00:48:35,287
I made too much fried rice.

492
00:48:47,591 --> 00:48:48,675
Who is it?

493
00:48:48,759 --> 00:48:50,510
It's me, Dal-geon.

494
00:48:52,429 --> 00:48:53,305
Hae-ri Go?

495
00:48:57,893 --> 00:49:00,228
Ta-da! I've got fried chicken.

496
00:49:01,939 --> 00:49:05,484
-Why?
-Why else? Because I'm hungry.

497
00:49:06,151 --> 00:49:08,612
Oh, something smells good!
What is it? Kimchi fried rice?

498
00:49:10,155 --> 00:49:11,657
You must have read my mind.

499
00:49:11,740 --> 00:49:13,575
I was craving this on my way here.

500
00:49:13,867 --> 00:49:17,496
You should've called before you came over.
This place is a mess.

501
00:49:17,579 --> 00:49:19,915
It's good that I'm here.

502
00:49:19,998 --> 00:49:23,168
You made a lot. You even added ham!

503
00:49:28,298 --> 00:49:29,591
TTOBONGEE CHICKEN

504
00:49:37,015 --> 00:49:39,518
You're a good cook.
The seasoning is perfect.

505
00:49:40,644 --> 00:49:45,649
I'm not sure that we're close enough
for you to come here and eat with me.

506
00:49:48,694 --> 00:49:52,280
-What about Mr. Gi?
-Hwa-suk's at the hospital.

507
00:49:52,823 --> 00:49:54,241
Here, have some.

508
00:50:07,963 --> 00:50:08,797
You want some?

509
00:50:10,465 --> 00:50:12,050
Okay, I'll drink alone.

510
00:50:14,052 --> 00:50:15,387
No, pour me some too.

511
00:50:18,682 --> 00:50:22,144
I don't have any soju glasses.
Use this and sip slowly.

512
00:50:26,356 --> 00:50:27,232
Here.

513
00:50:28,316 --> 00:50:29,192
You did good today.

514
00:50:45,667 --> 00:50:46,626
What?

515
00:50:46,710 --> 00:50:48,962
Hey, hey. Take it easy.

516
00:50:52,466 --> 00:50:53,341
What's wrong with you?

517
00:50:56,178 --> 00:50:57,846
I'm trying to relax.

518
00:50:59,139 --> 00:51:00,932
So many things happened today.

519
00:51:25,999 --> 00:51:28,251
Wow, I can't believe she drank all this.

520
00:51:29,753 --> 00:51:32,047
Hae-ri Go!

521
00:51:34,132 --> 00:51:35,884
Where do you live? Let me take you home.

522
00:51:36,134 --> 00:51:39,012
No, sir, I can go home on my own.

523
00:51:40,013 --> 00:51:41,389
She's wasted.

524
00:51:41,765 --> 00:51:44,184
You can't go home on your own.
You're too drunk.

525
00:51:45,227 --> 00:51:47,687
Hae-ri Go, get up. Let's get you home.

526
00:51:58,406 --> 00:52:01,576
Do you hate me that much?

527
00:52:05,372 --> 00:52:07,457
Do you really

528
00:52:07,749 --> 00:52:11,253
hate me that much, Mr. Gi?

529
00:52:15,215 --> 00:52:19,511
What is it about me that you hate so much?

530
00:52:19,845 --> 00:52:22,472
Just tell me what it is...

531
00:52:23,265 --> 00:52:27,185
and I'll fix it.

532
00:52:35,193 --> 00:52:36,027
Hae-ri Go!

533
00:52:36,653 --> 00:52:39,865
Wake up. You should go home and sleep.

534
00:52:41,283 --> 00:52:42,450
Wake up, now.

535
00:52:42,534 --> 00:52:44,077
-Let's get you home.
-You--

536
00:52:49,082 --> 00:52:50,750
You're mine.

537
00:52:53,503 --> 00:52:54,546
What?

538
00:52:56,756 --> 00:52:58,675
You're mine.

539
00:53:01,887 --> 00:53:02,721
Hey.

540
00:53:05,056 --> 00:53:05,891
Go Hae-ri?

541
00:53:28,663 --> 00:53:30,540
Now you're mine.

542
00:53:37,923 --> 00:53:39,883
Ms. Go Hae-ri?

543
00:53:40,508 --> 00:53:42,969
Hae-ri... Hae-ri Go?

544
00:53:44,512 --> 00:53:45,597
Hae-ri Go.

545
00:53:45,972 --> 00:53:47,849
You can't sleep here.

546
00:53:50,727 --> 00:53:53,230
Hae-ri Go, wake up.

547
00:53:55,315 --> 00:53:56,816
Come here.

548
00:54:01,529 --> 00:54:02,906
An informant?

549
00:54:03,365 --> 00:54:06,952
It seems that Min Jae-sik
was bribed by John & Mark.

550
00:54:07,619 --> 00:54:10,705
He has links with
a high-ranking government official.

551
00:54:11,206 --> 00:54:14,292
-Who do you think the official is?
-We're looking into it.

552
00:54:14,376 --> 00:54:15,585
Do you have any evidence
to prove this?

553
00:54:16,211 --> 00:54:18,505
There's no other way to explain--

554
00:54:18,588 --> 00:54:20,215
Come on, Director An.

555
00:54:22,008 --> 00:54:24,219
Are you crazy?

556
00:54:24,678 --> 00:54:27,806
You're reporting this to the president
without any evidence?

557
00:54:28,056 --> 00:54:30,350
He asked me to report everything.

558
00:54:30,433 --> 00:54:33,186
But you still need basic facts.

559
00:54:35,021 --> 00:54:37,816
Can't you see he's exhausted
from doing so much work?

560
00:54:39,734 --> 00:54:41,027
Just solve the case as soon as possible.

561
00:54:42,737 --> 00:54:46,700
It's giving me such a headache.

562
00:54:47,158 --> 00:54:48,285
Yes, Mr. President.

563
00:55:03,300 --> 00:55:04,134
Down.

564
00:55:08,430 --> 00:55:09,347
I'm sorry.

565
00:55:09,764 --> 00:55:11,891
The leash slipped through my fingers.

566
00:55:14,102 --> 00:55:16,187
-You can go now.
-Yes, sir.

567
00:55:24,321 --> 00:55:27,365
This dog is smarter than An.

568
00:55:28,950 --> 00:55:31,995
You should've just bitten him real hard.

569
00:55:32,287 --> 00:55:35,290
Sometimes you need to take initiative.

570
00:55:35,540 --> 00:55:38,752
I've kept my reputation clean
during my term in office.

571
00:55:38,835 --> 00:55:40,712
I don't need a bucket of shit on me now.

572
00:55:42,464 --> 00:55:43,548
Take him away.

573
00:55:48,219 --> 00:55:52,432
It's more like you did a good job
of making sure things were cleaned up.

574
00:55:53,475 --> 00:55:55,977
And I was a part of that cleaning crew.

575
00:55:57,270 --> 00:55:58,104
Master Hong.

576
00:56:00,648 --> 00:56:02,692
It's been ages
since you've called me that.

577
00:56:02,984 --> 00:56:05,403
Use that extraordinary brain of yours

578
00:56:05,487 --> 00:56:07,572
and tell me what I should do.

579
00:56:07,655 --> 00:56:12,452
I gave you the photos of Park Man-yeong
for a time like this.

580
00:56:19,084 --> 00:56:21,378
Use the Minister of Defense
as a scapegoat?

581
00:56:21,461 --> 00:56:22,754
That's right.

582
00:56:23,254 --> 00:56:25,173
He can be used as cannon fodder,

583
00:56:25,423 --> 00:56:27,092
and he's easy to get rid of.

584
00:56:27,425 --> 00:56:28,676
You should've been...

585
00:56:30,095 --> 00:56:32,639
the director general of the NIS
instead of the prime minister.

586
00:56:35,058 --> 00:56:37,060
Then we'd already
be living in a unified country.

587
00:57:03,086 --> 00:57:05,588
REST IN PEACE
FUNERAL DAY 49 OF THE B357 VICTIMS

588
00:57:16,099 --> 00:57:18,143
KANG MI-SEON,
WIFE OF PARK KWANG-DEOK

589
00:57:22,897 --> 00:57:26,359
CHA HOON, NEPHEW OF CHA DAL-GEON

590
00:57:32,782 --> 00:57:36,661
We ask the government
to find out the truth...

591
00:57:36,744 --> 00:57:38,663
PRESIDENT JEONG GOOK-PYO,
PLEASE KEEP YOUR PROMISE

592
00:57:39,038 --> 00:57:41,166
...about what caused the B357 crash.

593
00:57:42,083 --> 00:57:43,960
President Jeong Gook-pyo

594
00:57:44,043 --> 00:57:46,588
promised to find out the truth,
but he has done nothing.

595
00:57:46,838 --> 00:57:50,133
And the  Ministry of National Defense
is working with John & Mark

596
00:57:50,508 --> 00:57:52,010
on the F-X plan.

597
00:57:52,343 --> 00:57:55,930
Politicians are not doing anything

598
00:57:56,014 --> 00:58:01,352
to investigate what happened,
or to enact a special law.

599
00:58:02,228 --> 00:58:05,565
We're not asking for compensation.

600
00:58:06,566 --> 00:58:08,359
We don't understand...

601
00:58:08,443 --> 00:58:09,944
STAYING SILENT IS ALSO A CRIME

602
00:58:10,028 --> 00:58:14,449
...why we had to lose our loved ones,
and we want this abnormal situation...

603
00:58:15,950 --> 00:58:17,619
to be made right.

604
00:58:18,870 --> 00:58:20,580
No money can heal the pain...

605
00:58:21,956 --> 00:58:24,542
that comes from losing a family.

606
00:58:26,503 --> 00:58:29,130
We want to know...

607
00:58:29,797 --> 00:58:31,758
why we had to lose our loved ones.

608
00:58:33,218 --> 00:58:37,305
Please get to the bottom
of the B357 crash.

609
00:58:38,139 --> 00:58:41,518
Please enact a special law
so that this kind of tragedy...

610
00:58:42,352 --> 00:58:44,312
will never happen again.

611
00:58:44,395 --> 00:58:46,731
Report this anonymously to the NIS.

612
00:58:46,814 --> 00:58:47,857
You got it.

613
00:58:47,941 --> 00:58:50,610
People of Korea
whose hearts are also broken...

614
00:58:51,486 --> 00:58:53,905
please give us your support,

615
00:58:54,405 --> 00:58:56,908
even though we couldn't protect...

616
00:59:01,204 --> 00:59:02,914
SEONDEOK JUDO GYM

617
00:59:02,997 --> 00:59:05,875
This is frustrating.
How's the NIS investigation going?

618
00:59:05,959 --> 00:59:07,585
Are you still in touch with Hae-ri?

619
00:59:08,795 --> 00:59:11,130
I haven't heard from her.
She must be busy.

620
00:59:11,214 --> 00:59:12,257
I see.

621
00:59:22,392 --> 00:59:24,060
Wait. That guy...

622
00:59:24,727 --> 00:59:26,354
What? Who?

623
00:59:28,147 --> 00:59:30,900
I'm Jo Bu-yeong,
a reporter from Pyeonghwa Daily.

624
00:59:31,901 --> 00:59:32,735
Mr. Jo!

625
00:59:33,695 --> 00:59:34,904
I saw him die.

626
00:59:35,196 --> 00:59:36,906
What? Who?

627
00:59:39,158 --> 00:59:41,327
Dal-geon. Dal-geon!

628
00:59:55,883 --> 00:59:57,093
Mr. Jo Bu-yeong!

629
01:00:04,642 --> 01:00:05,560
Mr. Jo!

630
01:00:06,102 --> 01:00:07,228
Mr. Jo Bu-yeong!

631
01:00:12,942 --> 01:00:13,860
