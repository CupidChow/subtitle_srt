1
00:01:14,574 --> 00:01:15,867
I swear,

2
00:01:17,535 --> 00:01:18,745
that I will tell

3
00:01:19,829 --> 00:01:21,414
the truth, the whole truth,

4
00:01:22,165 --> 00:01:23,875
and nothing but the truth,

5
00:01:25,376 --> 00:01:26,836
and should I commit perjury,

6
00:01:28,046 --> 00:01:30,882
I will accept
the pains and penalties to come.

7
00:01:35,845 --> 00:01:37,388
Defense attorney.

8
00:01:38,306 --> 00:01:39,766
You may question the witness.

9
00:01:50,527 --> 00:01:52,445
O Sang-mi held a press conference.

10
00:01:53,238 --> 00:01:55,490
Are you aware of that press conference?

11
00:01:58,451 --> 00:02:00,787
What my wife said that day

12
00:02:01,496 --> 00:02:02,622
is not true.

13
00:02:05,125 --> 00:02:06,376
It's not true?

14
00:02:07,627 --> 00:02:11,422
Does that mean you were paid
to take down the plane,

15
00:02:12,382 --> 00:02:13,591
not by Dynamic, but--

16
00:02:13,675 --> 00:02:15,510
It was Michael Almeida,

17
00:02:15,969 --> 00:02:18,388
John & Mark Asia's vice president.

18
00:02:22,851 --> 00:02:23,726
Witness.

19
00:02:24,144 --> 00:02:25,645
Do you have proof?

20
00:02:26,354 --> 00:02:29,983
We have the secret account
that you used with Dynamic.

21
00:02:30,483 --> 00:02:32,777
-If you have no proof on Michael--
-I do.

22
00:02:34,195 --> 00:02:35,196
Wait.

23
00:02:35,530 --> 00:02:37,323
Did you say you have proof?

24
00:02:37,407 --> 00:02:39,826
You can find it on my FTP site.

25
00:02:40,243 --> 00:02:41,494
Please tell us the address.

26
00:02:42,120 --> 00:02:42,954
Check it.

27
00:02:44,205 --> 00:02:48,001
A, n, o, n, y,

28
00:02:48,459 --> 00:02:53,423
m, i, t, y, 3, 5, 7.

29
00:02:53,506 --> 00:02:56,009
Password, 5247600.

30
00:02:59,470 --> 00:03:01,598
Click on the file named "Idiot."

31
00:03:03,099 --> 00:03:04,392
IDIOT

32
00:03:40,845 --> 00:03:41,679
Is that him?

33
00:03:41,763 --> 00:03:44,140
-Wait, he was an accomplice?
-It's him.

34
00:03:47,810 --> 00:03:50,480
-You bastards!
-You call yourself a human being?

35
00:03:50,563 --> 00:03:52,899
-How could you?
-Jeez, this is driving me crazy.

36
00:03:52,982 --> 00:03:56,069
-You are all assholes!
-How could you do such a thing?

37
00:03:58,238 --> 00:03:59,906
That man in the video,

38
00:03:59,989 --> 00:04:02,742
who had transferred five million dollars
to my account,

39
00:04:04,160 --> 00:04:05,536
was Vice President Michael.

40
00:04:07,538 --> 00:04:08,498
That will be all.

41
00:04:09,123 --> 00:04:12,794
-My poor babies.
-Those evil bastards.

42
00:04:12,877 --> 00:04:14,504
How can they do that?

43
00:04:14,587 --> 00:04:17,340
God, my poor baby died for nothing...

44
00:04:18,216 --> 00:04:19,592
How could you do this?

45
00:04:23,846 --> 00:04:24,931
We're done.

46
00:04:25,848 --> 00:04:29,352
They have the proof
of John & Mark's incitement.

47
00:04:29,727 --> 00:04:33,064
Yun, I think we have to meet somewhere.

48
00:04:34,065 --> 00:04:36,776
The prosecution will start
a special investigation soon.

49
00:04:36,859 --> 00:04:40,280
I need you to come up with a plan
for us to get through--

50
00:04:40,363 --> 00:04:42,657
Do you think I'm here to wipe your ass?

51
00:04:44,617 --> 00:04:46,369
What did you just say?

52
00:04:46,452 --> 00:04:49,580
Get rid of all the evidence,
pin the blame on Director An,

53
00:04:49,664 --> 00:04:52,667
and don't give incriminating statements.
Don't you know the basics?

54
00:04:53,668 --> 00:04:57,255
I'm not asking you
to give me some basic advice.

55
00:04:57,839 --> 00:05:00,049
I trusted your authority
as the senior secretary.

56
00:05:00,133 --> 00:05:02,885
Can't you at least stop
the prosecution for us?

57
00:05:02,969 --> 00:05:06,055
There's not much I can do,
so just try to get by as best as you can.

58
00:05:07,807 --> 00:05:10,393
If I'm correct, you are saying...

59
00:05:11,602 --> 00:05:13,646
that I should go to jail?

60
00:05:14,022 --> 00:05:14,939
I have to go.

61
00:05:15,273 --> 00:05:16,357
Hey, you twat.

62
00:05:18,276 --> 00:05:20,194
Aren't you the President's right-hand man?

63
00:05:20,278 --> 00:05:22,405
You told me to trust you
and do as you say.

64
00:05:22,697 --> 00:05:26,367
If I lose my job and go to jail,
who will take care of my family?

65
00:05:31,080 --> 00:05:33,291
Yun Han-gi. Hey!

66
00:05:34,667 --> 00:05:36,294
You punk-ass son of a bitch--

67
00:05:36,377 --> 00:05:37,211
Hey!

68
00:05:38,212 --> 00:05:39,589
Stop right there!

69
00:05:39,964 --> 00:05:40,798
Hey!

70
00:05:43,509 --> 00:05:44,427
Dickhead!

71
00:05:59,525 --> 00:06:01,027
Isn't he supposed to be dead?

72
00:06:01,110 --> 00:06:02,737
But I saw him die...

73
00:06:04,697 --> 00:06:06,824
So that's what happened.

74
00:06:06,908 --> 00:06:08,326
Hey, you!

75
00:06:08,409 --> 00:06:12,663
I was dying to find out
who was pulling the damn strings...

76
00:06:14,832 --> 00:06:18,127
-Ow, damn it!
-So many agents have died because of you.

77
00:06:19,045 --> 00:06:20,838
You piece of shit!

78
00:06:20,922 --> 00:06:22,924
You call yourself a human?

79
00:06:24,133 --> 00:06:25,760
You frigging animal!

80
00:06:26,677 --> 00:06:27,512
That's enough.

81
00:06:39,190 --> 00:06:41,025
I will now announce the verdict.

82
00:06:41,984 --> 00:06:46,280
Based on Article 756, Section 757
of the Civil Code,

83
00:06:46,364 --> 00:06:49,826
for the crash of the B357 aircraft,
Dynamic System is responsible

84
00:06:50,535 --> 00:06:53,538
for employee mismanagement
and security failure,

85
00:06:53,913 --> 00:06:58,751
thus ordered by this court to compensate
11.5 billion won to the bereaved.

86
00:06:58,835 --> 00:07:00,920
-Wait, what?
-What is he saying?

87
00:07:02,130 --> 00:07:03,047
PLAINTIFF

88
00:07:06,801 --> 00:07:08,511
Your Honor, I don't understand.

89
00:07:09,595 --> 00:07:11,472
John & Mark committed the crime.

90
00:07:11,556 --> 00:07:13,599
Why are we compensated by Dynamic System?

91
00:07:13,683 --> 00:07:16,394
I think Dynamic is innocent
in all of this, isn't it?

92
00:07:16,477 --> 00:07:18,980
John & Mark should be responsible
for the compensation.

93
00:07:20,606 --> 00:07:21,774
Keep quiet, please.

94
00:07:25,069 --> 00:07:26,154
Defense attorney.

95
00:07:26,237 --> 00:07:28,614
You can appeal
against the court's decision.

96
00:07:29,115 --> 00:07:31,659
I have no intention to do so.

97
00:07:32,243 --> 00:07:33,703
-Why aren't you objecting?
-What?

98
00:07:33,786 --> 00:07:34,954
Why aren't you objecting?

99
00:07:35,037 --> 00:07:38,124
Either way, we have caused pain
for the bereaved.

100
00:07:38,708 --> 00:07:40,376
We will take responsibility.

101
00:07:43,588 --> 00:07:47,341
I would also like to add
that John & Mark will be charged

102
00:07:47,425 --> 00:07:50,428
with the crime
of attacking the B357 aircraft.

103
00:07:52,597 --> 00:07:53,973
They should be damned!

104
00:08:00,480 --> 00:08:01,522
Defense attorney.

105
00:08:02,732 --> 00:08:05,568
Are you willing to exercise
your right to indemnity?

106
00:08:06,777 --> 00:08:08,988
Yes, of course. Your Honor.

107
00:08:13,618 --> 00:08:17,538
When all of you have risked your lives
to reveal the truth,

108
00:08:18,164 --> 00:08:18,998
how could I not?

109
00:08:20,500 --> 00:08:21,375
Thank you.

110
00:08:22,543 --> 00:08:24,420
Thank you so much, and...

111
00:08:26,422 --> 00:08:27,548
I am sorry.

112
00:08:29,967 --> 00:08:31,093
Thank you.

113
00:08:32,303 --> 00:08:33,387
Thank you.

114
00:08:40,978 --> 00:08:42,396
I told you he's good!

115
00:08:42,480 --> 00:08:44,482
-Jeez, I'm sorry.
-I'm sorry.

116
00:08:44,565 --> 00:08:46,776
-I'm sorry. I was wrong.
-Good work.

117
00:08:46,859 --> 00:08:50,071
-Thanks, Dal-geon.
-We owe it all to you two.

118
00:08:50,238 --> 00:08:52,198
Sorry I doubted you, Dal-geon.

119
00:08:52,281 --> 00:08:53,699
I'm sorry, Dal-geon. Sorry.

120
00:08:55,076 --> 00:08:57,078
Come on, guys, don't do this.

121
00:08:57,161 --> 00:08:59,372
I should be thanking all of you.

122
00:08:59,455 --> 00:09:02,792
Without your help,
we wouldn't even be in this court.

123
00:09:03,376 --> 00:09:04,377
You think so?

124
00:09:04,794 --> 00:09:05,795
Right, Hae-ri?

125
00:09:09,840 --> 00:09:11,384
What's wrong? Are you hurt?

126
00:09:13,553 --> 00:09:15,054
No, I'm fine.

127
00:09:16,722 --> 00:09:18,349
It's just that my waist is...

128
00:09:19,600 --> 00:09:20,434
Huh?

129
00:09:21,143 --> 00:09:22,228
-Oh, my God!
-Hey!

130
00:09:24,063 --> 00:09:25,398
You're bleeding!

131
00:09:25,481 --> 00:09:28,109
Wait, let me see. Oh, no!

132
00:09:28,192 --> 00:09:29,819
I think she was shot.

133
00:09:29,902 --> 00:09:31,112
-Really?
-What do we do?

134
00:09:31,195 --> 00:09:32,280
Go Hae-ri!

135
00:09:32,363 --> 00:09:34,323
I was okay before...

136
00:09:35,533 --> 00:09:37,702
Now, it's starting to sting.

137
00:09:39,161 --> 00:09:40,329
Oh, my!

138
00:09:40,413 --> 00:09:42,331
-Get her on your back, quick.
-Be careful!

139
00:09:42,415 --> 00:09:44,041
Make way, people!

140
00:09:44,125 --> 00:09:45,501
-Hurry!
-Careful!

141
00:09:45,585 --> 00:09:47,461
Yes, a gunshot wound!

142
00:09:47,545 --> 00:09:49,797
Send an ambulance right away!

143
00:09:50,131 --> 00:09:51,882
Let me down. I said I can walk.

144
00:09:51,966 --> 00:09:53,301
Stay still!

145
00:09:53,384 --> 00:09:55,303
Out of the way!

146
00:09:55,803 --> 00:09:57,430
Can't you see that she's hurt?

147
00:09:57,513 --> 00:10:00,057
-Tell us your true feelings.
-It'll only take a moment.

148
00:10:00,725 --> 00:10:02,518
-Please give us a comment.
-Is she okay?

149
00:10:02,602 --> 00:10:04,228
How did this happen?

150
00:10:04,312 --> 00:10:05,938
Where were you
when we brought Kim?

151
00:10:06,355 --> 00:10:08,024
Huh? Where were you!

152
00:10:10,401 --> 00:10:14,196
You never wrote a word about it,
and now you want to act like journalists?

153
00:10:14,905 --> 00:10:17,074
-Move!
-Make way!

154
00:10:18,993 --> 00:10:22,705
It has been confirmed that John & Mark
was behind the plane crash,

155
00:10:22,788 --> 00:10:25,750
based on the testimony
given by Kim Woo-gi during the trial.

156
00:10:26,167 --> 00:10:29,545
The truth about the accident
would never have been discovered,

157
00:10:29,629 --> 00:10:32,506
if it weren't for the struggle
and dedication of the bereaved.

158
00:10:33,633 --> 00:10:35,343
The whole country wants to know

159
00:10:35,426 --> 00:10:38,471
who the NIS and the police
were working for--

160
00:10:38,554 --> 00:10:39,722
Step aside!

161
00:10:39,805 --> 00:10:41,807
I see Cha Dal-geon and Go Hae-ri!

162
00:10:43,934 --> 00:10:46,354
Mr. Cha Dal-geon!

163
00:10:46,812 --> 00:10:48,564
-Move.
-Mr. Cha, people are watching.

164
00:10:48,648 --> 00:10:49,857
Please say something.

165
00:10:49,940 --> 00:10:53,736
Unimaginable things have just happened.
Who do you think is behind all this?

166
00:10:58,574 --> 00:11:02,161
Do you remember
when you told me not to worry,

167
00:11:03,162 --> 00:11:04,997
that you will discover the truth?

168
00:11:07,083 --> 00:11:08,501
Even now...

169
00:11:09,752 --> 00:11:11,337
Even now I am hoping...

170
00:11:11,420 --> 00:11:13,631
ONE OF THE BEREAVED
BEING TRANSFERRED TO HOSPITAL

171
00:11:13,714 --> 00:11:15,633
...that you are not behind this.

172
00:11:19,136 --> 00:11:20,930
Who are you talking to?

173
00:11:22,682 --> 00:11:23,683
The President.

174
00:11:27,770 --> 00:11:30,940
Are you saying that the man
behind this scandalous incident is--

175
00:11:31,023 --> 00:11:34,902
The President of the Republic of Korea,
Jeong Gook-pyo.

176
00:11:34,985 --> 00:11:37,238
That son of a bitch.

177
00:11:37,738 --> 00:11:39,907
Make an official statement right now.

178
00:11:40,366 --> 00:11:43,119
Find everyone that was involved,
punish them,

179
00:11:43,202 --> 00:11:45,037
and beg for forgiveness.

180
00:11:46,247 --> 00:11:47,832
If you are truly the President,

181
00:11:48,958 --> 00:11:50,793
that's the least you can do.

182
00:11:52,837 --> 00:11:56,716
Do you really think it was the President?
Please say something!

183
00:11:57,508 --> 00:12:00,219
Did he just shit on me?

184
00:12:00,302 --> 00:12:01,595
They're leaving, move!

185
00:12:01,679 --> 00:12:03,973
Step away! Go! Go!

186
00:12:13,149 --> 00:12:14,734
119 PARAMEDIC

187
00:12:20,072 --> 00:12:22,074
Come on, people, let us through!

188
00:12:23,075 --> 00:12:23,909
Damn it.

189
00:12:25,661 --> 00:12:27,955
WHO ORDERED NIS AND POLICE?

190
00:12:28,038 --> 00:12:28,873
Huh?

191
00:12:30,207 --> 00:12:31,041
Dal-geon.

192
00:12:31,125 --> 00:12:32,209
Yes?

193
00:12:32,293 --> 00:12:33,627
Sit me up.

194
00:12:33,711 --> 00:12:36,464
You've been shot
and they told you not to move.

195
00:12:37,256 --> 00:12:38,090
I'm fine.

196
00:12:39,425 --> 00:12:41,010
You should stay down.

197
00:12:41,093 --> 00:12:43,012
-We'll be careful.
-I'm okay.

198
00:12:44,138 --> 00:12:44,972
Easy.

199
00:12:47,057 --> 00:12:48,893
CHA SAYS
THE MASTERMIND IS THE PRESIDENT

200
00:12:48,976 --> 00:12:50,186
The Internet's gone wild.

201
00:12:50,269 --> 00:12:52,396
Look at the trending topics.

202
00:12:52,480 --> 00:12:55,649
What? Is this even possible?

203
00:12:55,733 --> 00:12:57,902
-Hey, it says that the President did it.
-What?

204
00:12:57,985 --> 00:13:00,488
JOHN & MARK DENIED THE CLAIMS

205
00:13:22,468 --> 00:13:23,886
So this is how it feels...

206
00:13:26,222 --> 00:13:28,516
to work for my country,

207
00:13:29,975 --> 00:13:32,311
and to work for the people.

208
00:13:35,481 --> 00:13:37,858
How can you laugh when you were shot?

209
00:13:37,942 --> 00:13:40,444
Well, it does hurt,

210
00:13:40,694 --> 00:13:42,321
but I can't stop laughing.

211
00:13:45,074 --> 00:13:46,367
Ouch, my shoulder.

212
00:13:51,163 --> 00:13:52,706
Without you,

213
00:13:53,499 --> 00:13:55,084
I would've given up before long.

214
00:13:56,710 --> 00:13:58,170
Thank you, Dal-geon.

215
00:14:02,216 --> 00:14:06,053
You seem to be saying all the things
that I want to say to you.

216
00:14:07,513 --> 00:14:08,514
But,

217
00:14:09,974 --> 00:14:11,559
if I have to do that again,

218
00:14:13,310 --> 00:14:14,979
I don't think I can do it.

219
00:14:18,399 --> 00:14:21,652
Stop saying things that I wanted to say.

220
00:14:30,870 --> 00:14:33,205
Is it true that the President is involved?

221
00:14:33,289 --> 00:14:36,458
No way. Don't be tricked by fake news.

222
00:14:39,295 --> 00:14:41,672
Shouldn't the President make a statement?

223
00:14:41,755 --> 00:14:43,424
He is looking into the situation.

224
00:14:43,507 --> 00:14:45,259
As soon as he is ready, he will--

225
00:14:45,342 --> 00:14:47,261
Based on Mr. Cha Dal-geon's claims,

226
00:14:47,344 --> 00:14:50,556
NIS agents have tried to kill Kim
since they were back in Morocco.

227
00:14:52,683 --> 00:14:53,767
That's not true.

228
00:14:53,851 --> 00:14:57,771
It was the NIS and the police
that stopped Kim from going to the court.

229
00:14:57,855 --> 00:15:00,399
Are you aware that they were ordered
to kill Kim Woo-gi?

230
00:15:00,482 --> 00:15:01,525
Is that true?

231
00:15:01,609 --> 00:15:03,527
-Is it?
-Answer the question!

232
00:15:03,611 --> 00:15:05,070
That is not yet--

233
00:15:05,154 --> 00:15:07,615
We already know
that Blue House revised the budget,

234
00:15:07,698 --> 00:15:09,783
just to hand over the F-X plan
to John & Mark.

235
00:15:09,867 --> 00:15:11,452
What more do we need to know?

236
00:15:12,161 --> 00:15:14,038
What she said, is it true?

237
00:15:14,121 --> 00:15:16,957
The President will be making
an official statement soon.

238
00:15:17,041 --> 00:15:18,375
I must ask,

239
00:15:18,459 --> 00:15:21,795
that you refrain from writing
any speculative articles.

240
00:15:31,096 --> 00:15:35,517
To run a country, I've always thought

241
00:15:35,893 --> 00:15:39,521
that faith comes before honesty.

242
00:15:41,607 --> 00:15:44,276
For the deaths of the victims

243
00:15:44,944 --> 00:15:47,321
to mean something,

244
00:15:47,988 --> 00:15:52,618
I must do what I can
to make this country stronger than before.

245
00:16:02,544 --> 00:16:04,254
Even rabbits

246
00:16:05,631 --> 00:16:08,759
dig up three to four holes
when they build their homes,

247
00:16:10,678 --> 00:16:13,138
to make sure they can escape
if the need should arise.

248
00:16:18,686 --> 00:16:21,522
Secretary Yun planned the whole thing.

249
00:16:22,982 --> 00:16:26,735
He may have briefed you about it,
but as for the details...

250
00:16:27,361 --> 00:16:28,821
you don't know a thing.

251
00:16:30,197 --> 00:16:32,574
You want me
to be an incompetent president?

252
00:16:32,950 --> 00:16:35,119
Incompetence leads to criticism,

253
00:16:35,995 --> 00:16:38,580
but immorality gets you stoned.

254
00:16:39,081 --> 00:16:43,085
So Yun Han-gi must be my rabbit hole.

255
00:16:43,544 --> 00:16:45,838
You have to be prepared for the worst.

256
00:17:08,110 --> 00:17:10,154
I heard her legs might get paralyzed.

257
00:17:10,487 --> 00:17:11,989
She wasn't hit directly,

258
00:17:12,990 --> 00:17:15,325
but with a ricocheted bullet.

259
00:17:15,409 --> 00:17:17,077
It's still a bullet!

260
00:17:18,120 --> 00:17:20,164
It will take a while.

261
00:17:20,247 --> 00:17:22,291
You should go home and have a rest.

262
00:17:24,251 --> 00:17:25,586
We can't do that.

263
00:17:26,295 --> 00:17:29,173
You must all be tired, right?
Please, go and get some rest.

264
00:17:29,548 --> 00:17:31,800
I'll call you.
I'm going to the lounge for now.

265
00:17:31,884 --> 00:17:32,760
Let's go.

266
00:18:59,221 --> 00:19:02,474
Although this is yet an assumption,
if the President is indeed involved,

267
00:19:02,558 --> 00:19:04,434
the impact would be immense.

268
00:19:04,518 --> 00:19:06,520
What do you think, Professor?

269
00:19:06,603 --> 00:19:10,107
If it is confirmed that he is involved,

270
00:19:10,190 --> 00:19:11,942
that would be a calamity,

271
00:19:12,025 --> 00:19:15,320
but the President has not made
any official statements yet.

272
00:19:15,404 --> 00:19:18,073
A mass protest is scheduled
in Gwanghwamun, this weekend.

273
00:19:18,157 --> 00:19:20,784
I expect it to be a watershed moment.

274
00:19:20,868 --> 00:19:22,536
To tell you what I think,

275
00:19:22,619 --> 00:19:26,540
it is common in these situations
for the President to deny the suspicions,

276
00:19:26,623 --> 00:19:29,459
but judging from his silence,
we can guess that something's up.

277
00:19:29,543 --> 00:19:31,628
A lot of people want to know--

278
00:19:34,506 --> 00:19:35,924
Where are you?

279
00:19:36,592 --> 00:19:38,468
Come to Blue House right now.

280
00:19:39,386 --> 00:19:40,804
Wait, take it slow.

281
00:19:41,805 --> 00:19:45,475
Tell him to meet you outside.
He can't be seen here.

282
00:19:47,686 --> 00:19:49,563
No, let's meet outside.

283
00:19:50,063 --> 00:19:52,900
Yes. I'll see you there, sir.

284
00:20:18,842 --> 00:20:20,469
Did you say five percent?

285
00:20:23,430 --> 00:20:25,599
Five percent of the bidding amount?

286
00:20:26,016 --> 00:20:27,684
That's over 500 million dollars.

287
00:20:27,768 --> 00:20:29,269
I can't deal with that amount.

288
00:20:29,353 --> 00:20:33,357
The President will not be reacting
to an amount any lower than that.

289
00:20:34,483 --> 00:20:35,317
Three percent.

290
00:20:43,408 --> 00:20:44,701
Why take the hard way?

291
00:20:45,327 --> 00:20:47,621
Just tell them to raise the bid.

292
00:20:48,372 --> 00:20:51,708
If I choose their side,
they'll have the difference left over.

293
00:20:51,792 --> 00:20:54,586
They won't have to spend a penny
from their pockets.

294
00:20:55,003 --> 00:20:58,423
Our people will be paying for it,

295
00:20:59,174 --> 00:21:01,301
for the sake of the country.

296
00:21:01,385 --> 00:21:04,054
If the amount is higher
than that of Dynamic,

297
00:21:04,763 --> 00:21:06,431
the public will not like it.

298
00:21:06,515 --> 00:21:09,393
Sure, we might run over a bunch of bugs.

299
00:21:09,518 --> 00:21:11,603
But we must move forward.

300
00:21:12,479 --> 00:21:14,856
Be bold and get on with it.

301
00:21:14,940 --> 00:21:17,192
I'm the President. What are you afraid of?

302
00:22:10,662 --> 00:22:12,372
The Buddha once said,

303
00:22:12,873 --> 00:22:16,001
that all disasters start from the mouth,

304
00:22:17,502 --> 00:22:19,838
that the mouth is like an ax and a blade.

305
00:22:21,048 --> 00:22:23,425
But if we think about it,

306
00:22:23,508 --> 00:22:26,928
it also means that the mouth
can ultimately prevent disasters.

307
00:22:32,476 --> 00:22:33,560
I'll take the blame.

308
00:22:35,020 --> 00:22:38,565
What could you possibly have done
to say such a thing?

309
00:22:38,648 --> 00:22:42,944
Getting into an inappropriate deal
with John & Mark,

310
00:22:43,737 --> 00:22:46,490
pressuring the NIS
and the Ministry of National Defense,

311
00:22:47,074 --> 00:22:50,410
and ordering the police
to kill a witness--

312
00:22:50,494 --> 00:22:52,371
The subject is missing.

313
00:22:54,790 --> 00:22:55,707
Who did that?

314
00:22:58,335 --> 00:22:59,503
I did.

315
00:23:01,797 --> 00:23:04,466
I did all that without your approval.

316
00:23:07,469 --> 00:23:08,512
I apologize, sir.

317
00:23:13,392 --> 00:23:16,853
I wanted to bestow a big gift
to our people.

318
00:23:17,604 --> 00:23:21,942
A nation that no other countries
could easily look down upon.

319
00:23:23,693 --> 00:23:25,946
A wealthy and powerful nation.

320
00:23:26,947 --> 00:23:28,448
We all want that, sir.

321
00:23:30,075 --> 00:23:31,201
Please don't give up.

322
00:23:40,419 --> 00:23:43,255
Things will get noisy and annoying
for a while.

323
00:23:44,214 --> 00:23:47,259
But these things have an expiry date.

324
00:23:49,094 --> 00:23:51,096
Denying is easy,

325
00:23:51,179 --> 00:23:55,600
but proving needs tons of documents
and evidence.

326
00:24:01,898 --> 00:24:03,692
Don't worry about the aftermath.

327
00:24:04,443 --> 00:24:07,320
The roof might leak
and the windows might break,

328
00:24:08,071 --> 00:24:09,406
but the house is still here.

329
00:24:10,782 --> 00:24:12,159
It's the Blue House.

330
00:24:13,952 --> 00:24:17,456
The most grand and noble house
in this country.

331
00:24:32,012 --> 00:24:32,846
Yun.

332
00:24:43,690 --> 00:24:45,984
Are you going to obey his orders?

333
00:24:49,905 --> 00:24:53,158
He's planning to cut us off
and make us the scapegoats.

334
00:24:53,658 --> 00:24:55,285
The President has to survive,

335
00:24:56,453 --> 00:24:58,622
for us to climb our way back up.

336
00:24:59,539 --> 00:25:01,208
Don't do anything foolish.

337
00:25:02,375 --> 00:25:05,253
Co-destruction is the worst
that could happen.

338
00:25:08,256 --> 00:25:09,090
For all this,

339
00:25:10,383 --> 00:25:11,927
I blame you.

340
00:25:13,845 --> 00:25:17,098
If I told the President the truth
and got fired back then--

341
00:25:17,182 --> 00:25:19,184
You didn't have the balls back then.

342
00:25:19,935 --> 00:25:21,978
You didn't want to lose anything.

343
00:25:22,062 --> 00:25:24,272
You made your decision
based on your greed.

344
00:25:26,441 --> 00:25:29,402
You should blame yourself for that.

345
00:26:17,909 --> 00:26:19,911
CHARCOAL

346
00:27:06,166 --> 00:27:07,584
WONSEI HOSPITAL

347
00:27:10,795 --> 00:27:11,755
Step aside, please.

348
00:27:11,838 --> 00:27:15,216
-Oh, my God!
-Goodness.

349
00:27:15,300 --> 00:27:17,844
Hae-ri, are you okay?
She is still unconscious.

350
00:27:22,974 --> 00:27:23,892
How did it go?

351
00:27:23,975 --> 00:27:25,769
The surgery went really well.

352
00:27:25,852 --> 00:27:28,480
We found a small fracture in her spine,

353
00:27:28,563 --> 00:27:32,442
so she might have temporary paralysis,
but she'll be fine with physical therapy.

354
00:27:34,402 --> 00:27:35,236
Thank you, sir.

355
00:27:35,320 --> 00:27:36,655
-Thank you!
-Thanks!

356
00:27:36,738 --> 00:27:39,366
-Thank you so much.
-Thank you for your hard work.

357
00:27:39,908 --> 00:27:43,036
-Oh, God, I was so worried!
-I'll be back.

358
00:27:43,662 --> 00:27:45,580
The President is making his entrance.

359
00:28:01,012 --> 00:28:03,598
My esteemed fellow citizens.

360
00:28:04,265 --> 00:28:09,020
First, I would like to apologize
with all my heart

361
00:28:10,105 --> 00:28:14,234
for raising suspicion
and bringing confusion to all of you,

362
00:28:15,819 --> 00:28:17,987
regarding the B357 incident.

363
00:28:20,031 --> 00:28:24,119
When I came to knowledge
about the current situation,

364
00:28:24,202 --> 00:28:27,497
I could not help but be overcome
with disappointment and shock.

365
00:28:28,123 --> 00:28:29,708
Standing here

366
00:28:30,291 --> 00:28:32,544
as the President of this country,

367
00:28:33,044 --> 00:28:36,172
I would like to make a clear statement.

368
00:28:36,673 --> 00:28:40,719
All the bizarre rumors about me
that are going around,

369
00:28:42,095 --> 00:28:44,681
they are completely false!

370
00:28:46,766 --> 00:28:48,476
-Jeez.
-He's saying that it's a lie.

371
00:28:48,560 --> 00:28:51,688
However, I will not deny
my share of failure

372
00:28:51,771 --> 00:28:54,649
that has caused this disaster.

373
00:28:54,733 --> 00:28:59,320
To atone my guilt in front of those
who put their trust in me,

374
00:28:59,404 --> 00:29:05,952
I will do my best to root out
the culprits that started this.

375
00:29:07,454 --> 00:29:09,038
As a first step,

376
00:29:09,122 --> 00:29:14,085
the two culprits that were confirmed,
Senior Secretary Yun Han-gi

377
00:29:14,461 --> 00:29:16,129
and Director An Gi-dong of the NIS,

378
00:29:17,881 --> 00:29:21,134
will be dismissed from their positions,
effective immediately.

379
00:29:24,637 --> 00:29:25,889
From now on,

380
00:29:26,973 --> 00:29:29,517
the judicial branch of this country

381
00:29:29,601 --> 00:29:33,563
will stop at nothing
and find out the truth as is,

382
00:29:34,189 --> 00:29:35,440
and based on the findings,

383
00:29:36,775 --> 00:29:40,737
appropriate and strict legal measures
should be taken.

384
00:29:44,365 --> 00:29:46,242
Please say a word to the citizens.

385
00:29:47,494 --> 00:29:49,037
Can you say a few words?

386
00:29:49,120 --> 00:29:52,332
Is it true that you named
Secretary Yun to be the man behind?

387
00:29:52,415 --> 00:29:54,000
Were you bribed by John & Mark?

388
00:29:55,960 --> 00:29:58,087
I'll fully cooperate
with the investigation.

389
00:29:59,756 --> 00:30:02,300
But that means nothing.
Please tell us something else!

390
00:30:02,425 --> 00:30:04,052
After the President's statement,

391
00:30:04,135 --> 00:30:07,180
Director General An Gi-dong showed up
at the Prosecutors' Office,

392
00:30:07,263 --> 00:30:10,350
but Senior Secretary Yun Han-gi
is still missing.

393
00:30:10,809 --> 00:30:13,686
The NIS task force team has named
Secretary Yun Han-gi

394
00:30:13,770 --> 00:30:15,313
as a key figure of this scandal,

395
00:30:15,396 --> 00:30:18,525
and sent an investigation team
to Yun's hometown,

396
00:30:18,608 --> 00:30:20,568
searching for his whereabouts.

397
00:31:27,010 --> 00:31:28,052
Suicide?

398
00:31:29,387 --> 00:31:30,680
Yun Han-gi?

399
00:31:37,604 --> 00:31:39,439
He committed suicide?

400
00:31:40,648 --> 00:31:44,277
Apparently, he lit up
a piece of charcoal in his car,

401
00:31:44,819 --> 00:31:47,238
but it seems
that his condition is uncertain.

402
00:31:49,407 --> 00:31:51,784
Coming up with excuses with An
would have sufficed.

403
00:31:51,868 --> 00:31:54,704
He didn't need to make
such a rash decision...

404
00:31:55,204 --> 00:31:57,248
I know Han-gi very well.

405
00:31:59,584 --> 00:32:01,920
He'd rather die and become soil,

406
00:32:03,379 --> 00:32:05,965
than to live like a corpse.

407
00:32:07,967 --> 00:32:09,093
Well...

408
00:32:09,844 --> 00:32:11,512
Anyway,

409
00:32:12,847 --> 00:32:16,309
we can now pin everything on Yun.

410
00:32:18,603 --> 00:32:20,396
Should I cry?

411
00:32:23,274 --> 00:32:25,068
Or should I smile?

412
00:32:26,110 --> 00:32:27,612
I can't decide.

413
00:32:41,459 --> 00:32:43,002
Why isn't she cooling down?

414
00:32:43,628 --> 00:32:46,005
She had some fever reducers.
She will get better.

415
00:32:53,179 --> 00:32:55,056
-Thanks.
-You're welcome.

416
00:34:18,306 --> 00:34:19,432
Cha Dal-geon.

417
00:34:21,142 --> 00:34:22,602
Do I look like that douchebag?

418
00:34:33,905 --> 00:34:36,282
Oh, Hwa-suk.

419
00:34:38,910 --> 00:34:40,578
Were you here with me last night?

420
00:34:40,661 --> 00:34:42,538
Dal-geon just left.

421
00:34:42,622 --> 00:34:44,791
I think he hasn't slept at all.

422
00:34:46,501 --> 00:34:47,627
Oh, you should know.

423
00:34:47,960 --> 00:34:52,298
Chief Gang came back to the office
as the new task force team leader.

424
00:34:52,381 --> 00:34:55,468
Mr. Gi, Se-hun
and I have all returned, too!

425
00:34:58,012 --> 00:34:58,888
What about me?

426
00:34:58,971 --> 00:35:01,390
Of course, you are back.

427
00:35:01,474 --> 00:35:03,935
You had a major role in solving this case.

428
00:35:04,018 --> 00:35:06,312
I bet you'll get a promotion and reward.

429
00:35:06,395 --> 00:35:07,355
Oh, yeah.

430
00:35:07,438 --> 00:35:09,357
Mr. Gi told me to call him when you're up.

431
00:35:09,440 --> 00:35:11,442
-Want to call him?
-Later.

432
00:35:11,734 --> 00:35:12,819
Poor girl.

433
00:35:14,654 --> 00:35:17,240
Where is Dal-geon off to?

434
00:35:17,323 --> 00:35:21,577
He said he's going
to that Jessica girl's press conference.

435
00:35:45,476 --> 00:35:48,354
Cancel the press conference.
Get ready to leave for the States.

436
00:35:48,437 --> 00:35:50,189
You're banned to leave the country.

437
00:35:51,315 --> 00:35:52,775
-What?
-Soon...

438
00:35:53,609 --> 00:35:55,111
They might come to arrest you.

439
00:35:55,194 --> 00:35:57,738
What are you talking about?
No one can arrest me!

440
00:35:57,822 --> 00:35:59,824
If Secretary Yun or Minister Park

441
00:36:00,908 --> 00:36:02,451
mention your name--

442
00:36:02,535 --> 00:36:03,744
They will never do that!

443
00:36:04,871 --> 00:36:06,956
How much did Jeong Gook-pyo take from us?

444
00:36:07,832 --> 00:36:09,417
No less than 500 million dollars.

445
00:36:09,542 --> 00:36:10,835
That's over 500 billion won!

446
00:36:10,918 --> 00:36:13,838
Do you think they'll talk
when that would destroy the Blue House?

447
00:36:13,921 --> 00:36:14,755
No way.

448
00:36:15,673 --> 00:36:17,508
The President won't let them.

449
00:36:19,343 --> 00:36:22,722
Then, are you proceeding with the deal?

450
00:36:25,474 --> 00:36:27,185
The head office is acting strange.

451
00:36:28,978 --> 00:36:33,357
I have to make this deal work
if I want to survive.

452
00:36:43,451 --> 00:36:44,785
She's coming!

453
00:36:45,328 --> 00:36:49,081
JOHN & MARK MILITARY TECHNOLOGY
EMERGENCY PRESS CONFERENCE

454
00:37:10,853 --> 00:37:14,690
As a person indirectly concerned
with this incident

455
00:37:15,608 --> 00:37:17,068
related to the B357 aircraft,

456
00:37:18,569 --> 00:37:21,405
I would like to offer
my deepest condolences.

457
00:37:22,615 --> 00:37:23,449
This crime,

458
00:37:24,617 --> 00:37:28,246
committed by the former VP
of the Asia Region, Michael Almeida,

459
00:37:28,329 --> 00:37:30,581
was caused by his twisted love
for the company,

460
00:37:30,665 --> 00:37:32,541
and he was solely involved...

461
00:37:36,128 --> 00:37:37,046
What is that?

462
00:37:49,558 --> 00:37:51,435
SEOUL CHILDREN'S TAEKWONDO
HAN SEUNG-MIN

463
00:37:51,519 --> 00:37:53,938
MAY YOU BLOSSOM
IN OUR HEARTS. WE LOVE YOU.

464
00:38:00,945 --> 00:38:02,571
OUR CHILDREN ARE CALLING OUT TO US.

465
00:38:02,655 --> 00:38:03,781
LEE PIL-YONG

466
00:38:03,864 --> 00:38:05,116
WE WANT TRUTH, NOT MONEY.

467
00:38:05,199 --> 00:38:07,034
MAY YOU BLOSSOM IN OUR HEARTS.

468
00:38:18,879 --> 00:38:22,008
I assure you that John & Mark

469
00:38:22,091 --> 00:38:26,929
will investigate, take responsibility
and compensate the victims,

470
00:38:27,013 --> 00:38:28,639
as faithfully as we can.

471
00:38:30,224 --> 00:38:34,061
However, I would also like to comment
that those who falsely identify

472
00:38:34,395 --> 00:38:36,647
this incident to the F-X plan

473
00:38:36,731 --> 00:38:39,483
will face strong legal actions
against our company--

474
00:38:39,567 --> 00:38:40,860
Is that Lim Pil-gyu?

475
00:38:40,943 --> 00:38:43,946
-Wait, this is...
-He's with a woman.

476
00:38:44,405 --> 00:38:46,699
-What is this?
-This is Lim Pil-gyu.

477
00:38:46,782 --> 00:38:47,867
Isn't that Lim Pil-gyu?

478
00:38:51,370 --> 00:38:53,497
-Did they lobby them?
-Unbelievable.

479
00:39:05,509 --> 00:39:06,886
What is he doing?

480
00:39:07,303 --> 00:39:08,804
This is definitely Lim Pil-gyu.

481
00:39:09,221 --> 00:39:11,182
-This is Lim Pil-gyu.
-What is this?

482
00:39:11,807 --> 00:39:12,933
-Huh?
-This photo.

483
00:39:13,392 --> 00:39:14,727
There's a man behind her too.

484
00:39:15,227 --> 00:39:18,898
The Minister of National Defense
and Jessica?

485
00:39:18,981 --> 00:39:20,608
-Isn't that her?
-Jessica?

486
00:39:20,941 --> 00:39:23,444
-Isn't this you?
-Is the person in this photo...

487
00:39:23,527 --> 00:39:25,321
-Is this you?
-Ms. Jessica.

488
00:39:31,285 --> 00:39:32,536
Is this you?

489
00:39:39,960 --> 00:39:40,795
Jessica Lee.

490
00:39:42,380 --> 00:39:44,006
We're from the Prosecutor's office.

491
00:39:45,633 --> 00:39:47,760
You are under arrest for illegal lobbying.

492
00:39:48,511 --> 00:39:49,345
Take her.

493
00:39:50,388 --> 00:39:52,306
Why are you being arrested by prosecutors?

494
00:39:57,186 --> 00:39:59,522
-Why did you kill them?
-Bring my son back to life!

495
00:40:09,240 --> 00:40:11,826
-Tell the truth!
-Bring my son back to life!

496
00:40:21,377 --> 00:40:25,756
Why did my Min-sang have to die?

497
00:40:34,682 --> 00:40:36,058
Come in.

498
00:40:37,643 --> 00:40:39,645
Take a seat, next to your husband.

499
00:40:40,896 --> 00:40:42,481
Take a seat.

500
00:40:47,528 --> 00:40:50,364
I asked you two the same question,

501
00:40:50,448 --> 00:40:51,949
and got two different answers.

502
00:40:52,658 --> 00:40:54,952
Who is the liar here?

503
00:40:55,953 --> 00:40:56,954
Asshole.

504
00:40:58,873 --> 00:40:59,707
What?

505
00:41:00,458 --> 00:41:02,751
Is that the first thing
you say to me in months?

506
00:41:05,045 --> 00:41:06,046
I'm innocent.

507
00:41:06,505 --> 00:41:09,341
Getting paid by John & Mark
to drop that plane,

508
00:41:09,425 --> 00:41:11,427
he did all that by himself!

509
00:41:11,510 --> 00:41:12,636
Sang-mi!

510
00:41:13,220 --> 00:41:16,432
You asked for five billion won!
For taking care of the situation here!

511
00:41:16,515 --> 00:41:19,268
-You called yourself a "partner."
-No, I didn't!

512
00:41:21,353 --> 00:41:22,897
You pathetic loser.

513
00:41:22,980 --> 00:41:26,400
You killed all those people
and now you're dragging your wife into it.

514
00:41:26,484 --> 00:41:29,737
-You bitch!
-What do you think you are doing?

515
00:41:30,362 --> 00:41:31,197
Hit me.

516
00:41:32,490 --> 00:41:33,324
Go on.

517
00:41:34,033 --> 00:41:34,950
Hit me!

518
00:41:35,034 --> 00:41:37,077
You two must be out of your minds!

519
00:41:37,161 --> 00:41:39,788
We didn't bring you together
just so you can fight!

520
00:41:40,456 --> 00:41:42,416
You ruined my life.

521
00:41:42,500 --> 00:41:44,793
Bring my life back, you asshole!

522
00:41:44,877 --> 00:41:46,629
Let me go, you psycho!

523
00:41:46,712 --> 00:41:49,298
-You ruined my life, too!
-Hey!

524
00:41:51,258 --> 00:41:52,676
Stop it, you psychos!

525
00:41:52,760 --> 00:41:54,845
-Are you people out of your minds?
-You psycho!

526
00:41:54,929 --> 00:41:56,138
Are you crazy? Hey, hey!

527
00:41:56,222 --> 00:41:59,141
I don't think we can get any more
out of those two.

528
00:42:00,100 --> 00:42:01,435
Send them back to jail.

529
00:42:03,646 --> 00:42:04,522
Sir.

530
00:42:08,484 --> 00:42:10,694
Why did you hand Jessica over
to the prosecutors?

531
00:42:11,195 --> 00:42:13,614
-What do you mean?
-The video that went around.

532
00:42:14,281 --> 00:42:15,533
Isn't that from Vagabond?

533
00:42:15,950 --> 00:42:16,784
That's not us.

534
00:42:18,869 --> 00:42:21,539
Then who could possibly have sent...

535
00:42:21,622 --> 00:42:23,791
There must be someone else.

536
00:42:25,000 --> 00:42:26,752
We should've arrested her.

537
00:42:28,379 --> 00:42:30,422
I wish we didn't lose her
to the prosecutors.

538
00:43:20,097 --> 00:43:22,641
MINISTRY OF JUSTICE
URGENT PRISONER ESCORT

539
00:43:32,151 --> 00:43:33,277
Goodness.

540
00:43:33,360 --> 00:43:35,029
Welcome back!

541
00:43:35,988 --> 00:43:37,489
You must be tired.

542
00:43:37,573 --> 00:43:39,074
Would you like some massage?

543
00:43:43,954 --> 00:43:45,289
We have a newcomer?

544
00:43:45,831 --> 00:43:49,835
I don't know what she did outside,
but she's very stuck-up.

545
00:43:52,796 --> 00:43:53,631
Hey.

546
00:43:54,757 --> 00:43:55,674
Noob.

547
00:43:57,092 --> 00:43:59,678
Can't you hear the boss calling you?

548
00:44:01,388 --> 00:44:02,890
You're so annoying...

549
00:44:07,978 --> 00:44:08,896
O Sang-mi?

550
00:44:09,313 --> 00:44:10,147
Huh?

551
00:44:11,857 --> 00:44:13,150
Do you know her?

552
00:44:15,444 --> 00:44:17,863
Nice to see you in a place like this.

553
00:44:19,990 --> 00:44:20,824
Are you smiling?

554
00:44:35,339 --> 00:44:36,674
Stomp on her,

555
00:44:37,424 --> 00:44:39,009
until she nearly dies.

556
00:44:39,635 --> 00:44:41,679
Sheesh. Let's see.

557
00:44:44,598 --> 00:44:46,642
-Hey!
-You bitch.

558
00:44:59,113 --> 00:44:59,947
Stop.

559
00:45:19,842 --> 00:45:20,676
This

560
00:45:22,094 --> 00:45:24,805
is not even close
to what you've done to me.

561
00:45:27,141 --> 00:45:28,892
I'm getting out of here soon.

562
00:45:30,978 --> 00:45:32,396
But until then,

563
00:45:34,606 --> 00:45:36,066
I will beat the shit out of you.

564
00:45:40,487 --> 00:45:41,655
Sorry little bitch.

565
00:45:42,698 --> 00:45:43,532
What?

566
00:45:43,615 --> 00:45:47,327
Now that you're in jail,
you feel like you own the world, right?

567
00:45:50,122 --> 00:45:51,665
But the world is a scary place.

568
00:45:53,292 --> 00:45:54,501
I will prove it to you.

569
00:46:04,720 --> 00:46:05,637
Continue.

570
00:46:08,015 --> 00:46:09,975
-Let's stomp on her.
-Sheesh.

571
00:46:10,058 --> 00:46:11,393
Let's stomp on her some more.

572
00:46:26,742 --> 00:46:28,327
There's no one else here.

573
00:46:28,869 --> 00:46:31,538
These are killing me. Take them off.

574
00:46:33,123 --> 00:46:34,500
Where will I be staying?

575
00:46:35,375 --> 00:46:36,877
I asked for a hotel.

576
00:46:38,670 --> 00:46:41,048
I also want a double bed

577
00:46:41,423 --> 00:46:44,510
and a luxurious meal,
delivered to my room.

578
00:46:45,427 --> 00:46:46,845
And most importantly,

579
00:46:48,263 --> 00:46:49,264
I need some candies.

580
00:46:51,266 --> 00:46:52,309
You know what I mean?

581
00:46:54,061 --> 00:46:56,104
Not as in lollies, but drugs!

582
00:47:10,828 --> 00:47:11,829
Are we here already?

583
00:47:27,803 --> 00:47:29,179
You are Jerome...

584
00:47:33,141 --> 00:47:34,309
Stop the car!

585
00:47:36,144 --> 00:47:37,271
Where are you taking me?

586
00:47:38,397 --> 00:47:40,649
Stop the car, damn it!

587
00:47:42,109 --> 00:47:44,194
Stop! Stop right now!

588
00:47:44,945 --> 00:47:46,905
Stop the car... Wait!

589
00:47:46,989 --> 00:47:48,365
Just listen to me...

590
00:48:02,671 --> 00:48:03,547
Hae-ri.

591
00:48:04,089 --> 00:48:06,425
Why are you looking all around the place?

592
00:48:06,842 --> 00:48:08,844
Huh? It's nothing.

593
00:48:10,345 --> 00:48:12,598
Are you waiting for Dal-geon?

594
00:48:13,181 --> 00:48:16,435
What? Why would I be waiting for him?

595
00:48:17,269 --> 00:48:19,479
Yeah, the whole thing is now over.

596
00:48:19,563 --> 00:48:21,982
You guys don't have any reasons
to see each other now.

597
00:48:23,400 --> 00:48:25,444
Oh, yeah. I need to drop by the office.

598
00:48:25,527 --> 00:48:27,863
-Will you be fine on your own?
-Yes, go on.

599
00:48:27,946 --> 00:48:28,780
Okay.

600
00:48:29,072 --> 00:48:29,907
Breaking news.

601
00:48:29,990 --> 00:48:33,452
Former Senior Secretary Yun Han-gi
has attempted suicide.

602
00:48:34,328 --> 00:48:37,289
He is in an intensive care unit
at a hospital downtown,

603
00:48:37,372 --> 00:48:39,416
and his life is hanging by a thread.

604
00:48:39,499 --> 00:48:43,086
Hey, he can't just die like that.

605
00:48:43,211 --> 00:48:46,924
I'll say.
The investigation's just started.

606
00:48:47,007 --> 00:48:50,594
A bad guy until the very end.

607
00:48:50,677 --> 00:48:53,013
He deserves to go to hell!

608
00:48:53,096 --> 00:48:55,474
He was in a fatal condition
when he was found.

609
00:48:56,391 --> 00:49:00,812
Politicians from the opposing parties
have commented that this incident

610
00:49:00,896 --> 00:49:04,816
was the result of the government cutting
its tail off regarding the F-X scandal.

611
00:49:05,317 --> 00:49:07,235
The Blue House, on the other hand,

612
00:49:07,319 --> 00:49:10,864
is not issuing any official statements,
keeping silence on the matter.

613
00:49:32,135 --> 00:49:33,136
Hey.

614
00:49:33,845 --> 00:49:35,430
-Are you okay?
-Huh?

615
00:49:36,807 --> 00:49:39,142
-Dal-geon!
-Jeez.

616
00:49:39,226 --> 00:49:40,894
That was dangerous.

617
00:49:43,313 --> 00:49:44,856
I thought you'd never come.

618
00:49:45,524 --> 00:49:46,400
Why not?

619
00:49:46,483 --> 00:49:50,362
I mean, the case is now solved and...

620
00:49:50,779 --> 00:49:52,739
There is no reason for you to...

621
00:49:54,950 --> 00:49:57,244
Do we need a reason to see each other?

622
00:49:57,327 --> 00:50:00,580
What? No, I didn't mean that...

623
00:50:01,665 --> 00:50:02,499
Oh!

624
00:50:03,834 --> 00:50:06,378
I wanted to give you a present.

625
00:50:08,296 --> 00:50:09,131
Give me your hand.

626
00:50:16,138 --> 00:50:18,390
Imagine this hitting Kim Woo-gi instead.

627
00:50:18,807 --> 00:50:20,642
Even the thought gives me the creeps.

628
00:50:22,644 --> 00:50:23,520
Keep it.

629
00:50:24,730 --> 00:50:26,231
It's our lucky charm.

630
00:50:26,314 --> 00:50:28,567
I'm sure it will bring you
lots of good luck.

631
00:50:32,487 --> 00:50:34,531
By the way,
are you trying to walk already?

632
00:50:35,365 --> 00:50:36,491
Just needed some air.

633
00:50:43,915 --> 00:50:44,750
Here.

634
00:50:46,251 --> 00:50:48,128
-What are you doing?
-Helping you.

635
00:50:48,962 --> 00:50:51,048
I'm okay. I have people for that.

636
00:50:54,718 --> 00:50:56,428
Put your feet on top of mine.

637
00:50:58,305 --> 00:51:00,640
Are you sure this is an exercise?

638
00:51:00,724 --> 00:51:03,143
I know how to realign bones,
massage muscles,

639
00:51:03,226 --> 00:51:04,895
basically everything.

640
00:51:05,771 --> 00:51:08,607
Don't you know I'm a martial artist?
Put them up.

641
00:51:09,483 --> 00:51:11,485
Don't you dare complain
about me being heavy.

642
00:51:14,654 --> 00:51:17,783
Easy. That's it.

643
00:51:18,575 --> 00:51:21,078
Now, slowly.
We'll take one step at a time.

644
00:51:24,539 --> 00:51:25,373
Yes.

645
00:51:33,173 --> 00:51:34,257
Slowly.

646
00:51:44,518 --> 00:51:45,477
Yes.

647
00:51:47,062 --> 00:51:48,188
That's it.

648
00:51:52,943 --> 00:51:54,820
Does it hurt? Do you regret it?

649
00:51:55,862 --> 00:51:57,364
-We should stop--
-Focus!

650
00:51:58,740 --> 00:51:59,783
Focus.

651
00:52:02,327 --> 00:52:05,122
I gained weight these days.
I'm pretty sure I'm heavy.

652
00:52:05,539 --> 00:52:06,832
Don't worry about that.

653
00:52:07,582 --> 00:52:09,751
All right, with the left foot again.

654
00:52:35,402 --> 00:52:36,236
Are you okay?

655
00:52:42,784 --> 00:52:44,911
Um, hey...

656
00:52:45,495 --> 00:52:46,329
Go back.

657
00:53:36,630 --> 00:53:39,049
I'm the warden of this prison.

658
00:53:39,132 --> 00:53:42,636
I should've paid more attention to you.
I apologize, ma'am.

659
00:53:43,511 --> 00:53:45,263
Please make yourselves comfortable.

660
00:53:45,597 --> 00:53:46,431
Well, then...

661
00:53:46,765 --> 00:53:49,351
-A cup of coffee, please.
-Sorry?

662
00:53:50,435 --> 00:53:52,020
I'd like some rich, brewed coffee.

663
00:53:53,688 --> 00:53:55,190
Yes, of course.

664
00:54:01,947 --> 00:54:05,951
You will be able to make calls
and meet visitors as you like.

665
00:54:07,702 --> 00:54:10,580
Did you find out who spread the video?

666
00:54:10,664 --> 00:54:14,251
I believe it's one of the girls
from the party.

667
00:54:15,794 --> 00:54:18,880
Those girls would never do such a thing.

668
00:54:19,673 --> 00:54:20,882
I'll look further into it.

669
00:54:20,966 --> 00:54:22,425
No, I will look into it.

670
00:54:22,968 --> 00:54:24,844
You should go back to the States tonight.

671
00:54:25,553 --> 00:54:28,640
Then extradite me with the help
of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.

672
00:54:29,349 --> 00:54:30,267
Do you understand?

673
00:54:32,102 --> 00:54:32,978
Yes, ma'am.

674
00:54:34,229 --> 00:54:35,105
By the way...

675
00:54:36,356 --> 00:54:37,857
Your face looks bad.

676
00:54:42,529 --> 00:54:46,032
Since you're here,
put in a visit request for me.

677
00:54:46,574 --> 00:54:48,410
Yes, right there.

678
00:54:52,038 --> 00:54:53,665
4038, you have a visitor.

679
00:54:55,333 --> 00:54:56,167
A visitor?

680
00:54:59,212 --> 00:55:00,714
I wasn't expecting anyone.

681
00:55:17,230 --> 00:55:18,773
You are the visitor?

682
00:55:18,857 --> 00:55:22,152
You and I need to have a conversation.

683
00:55:32,704 --> 00:55:33,538
Why?

684
00:55:36,916 --> 00:55:38,335
Scared to be alone with me?

685
00:55:38,418 --> 00:55:40,920
If you so much as touch me,

686
00:55:41,880 --> 00:55:43,298
you will regret it when we--

687
00:55:53,641 --> 00:55:57,937
What? Beat the shit out of me?
No, I will beat the shit out of you.

688
00:55:59,230 --> 00:56:01,191
Your pathway to hell has just opened.

689
00:56:19,376 --> 00:56:20,377
Stomp on her.

690
00:56:25,090 --> 00:56:26,007
Didn't you hear me?

691
00:56:29,511 --> 00:56:30,720
I said, stomp on her.

692
00:56:30,804 --> 00:56:31,971
Well...

693
00:56:33,223 --> 00:56:35,517
The warden was here before and...

694
00:56:38,019 --> 00:56:40,897
Stomp on her, until she nearly dies.

695
00:56:43,400 --> 00:56:44,401
Sorry.

696
00:56:45,110 --> 00:56:47,779
Hey. Don't touch me! Hey!

697
00:56:48,321 --> 00:56:50,490
Are you mad? Hey!

698
00:56:51,741 --> 00:56:53,576
Take your socks off!

699
00:56:56,204 --> 00:56:57,539
Get off!

700
00:57:03,920 --> 00:57:05,922
Hey, don't come to me.

701
00:57:06,005 --> 00:57:09,259
-Hey, pass her here.
-Oh my, oh my.

702
00:57:09,342 --> 00:57:11,094
Hey.

703
00:57:21,771 --> 00:57:22,605
Why?

704
00:57:23,898 --> 00:57:27,026
Why don't you go to the guards
and tell them you got beaten?

705
00:57:27,986 --> 00:57:30,613
We might wear the same clothes,
but we are not the same.

706
00:57:32,073 --> 00:57:33,825
I'm going back to the States soon,

707
00:57:33,908 --> 00:57:36,327
so just bear it until then.

708
00:57:38,329 --> 00:57:39,539
Want to bet?

709
00:57:40,874 --> 00:57:42,333
On who goes out first?

710
00:57:43,626 --> 00:57:44,461
What?

711
00:57:44,544 --> 00:57:46,504
I'll be leaving here first.

712
00:57:47,881 --> 00:57:50,800
And you will rot in here until you reek.

713
00:57:55,180 --> 00:57:57,056
Judging by her stupid remarks,

714
00:57:57,765 --> 00:57:58,975
she needs more beating.

715
00:58:01,936 --> 00:58:04,898
Hey, come on, hey!

716
00:58:05,023 --> 00:58:07,484
-Ugh, seriously.
-Get it together already.

717
00:58:07,567 --> 00:58:09,277
-Get it together!
-All right?

718
00:58:23,291 --> 00:58:24,959
Wake up now. We have to exercise.

719
00:58:26,586 --> 00:58:28,838
Just give me ten more minutes.

720
00:58:29,255 --> 00:58:31,633
-I'm so tired...
-Just ten minutes? Ugh.

721
00:58:32,091 --> 00:58:35,136
When you are tired,
you need a good exercise.

722
00:58:35,678 --> 00:58:37,514
Can I just take a day off?

723
00:58:37,847 --> 00:58:38,890
-No.
-No?

724
00:58:39,974 --> 00:58:41,059
Slowly.

725
00:58:41,476 --> 00:58:44,229
Now, left foot, yes.

726
00:58:44,312 --> 00:58:45,813
Oh, very good.

727
00:58:46,147 --> 00:58:48,566
Right foot, breathe.

728
00:58:48,650 --> 00:58:49,484
Breathe!

729
00:58:50,568 --> 00:58:52,612
Right foot! Yes!

730
00:58:53,071 --> 00:58:54,447
Looking good, Hae-ri!

731
00:58:54,531 --> 00:58:56,866
We are going to the Olympics! Yes!

732
00:58:56,950 --> 00:58:58,743
-Left!
-You're embarrassing me!

733
00:58:58,826 --> 00:58:59,786
Turn it down!

734
00:59:00,703 --> 00:59:04,207
Oh, I'm sorry, everyone.

735
00:59:04,499 --> 00:59:05,750
See how much you've walked.

736
00:59:05,833 --> 00:59:08,878
You're a natural
when it comes to physical abilities!

737
00:59:08,962 --> 00:59:11,047
Let's take 20 more steps.
Come on, let's go!

738
00:59:11,756 --> 00:59:13,258
-My legs hurt.
-What?

739
00:59:13,716 --> 00:59:14,551
Which leg?

740
00:59:14,926 --> 00:59:16,135
-Both.
-Both?

741
00:59:18,221 --> 00:59:20,557
-Maybe we've overdone it.
-Yeah.

742
00:59:20,974 --> 00:59:21,891
Aw...

743
00:59:27,897 --> 00:59:29,732
-How does this feel?
-Good.

744
00:59:30,149 --> 00:59:33,403
These muscles are connected
to your spinal cords.

745
00:59:33,486 --> 00:59:34,779
It will help you walk.

746
00:59:38,032 --> 00:59:39,784
You are not enjoying this, are you?

747
00:59:42,412 --> 00:59:44,080
Enjoy what?

748
00:59:44,789 --> 00:59:46,958
I told you I'm a martial artist...

749
00:59:47,041 --> 00:59:48,293
It's a joke.

750
00:59:48,751 --> 00:59:50,712
You take everything so seriously.

751
00:59:52,672 --> 00:59:54,507
Stay still. This is good for you.

752
01:00:02,181 --> 01:00:04,684
A WORD OF KINDNESS
COMES BACK WITH A SMILE

753
01:00:24,329 --> 01:00:26,706
I know you killed Michael,
the vice president.

754
01:00:28,124 --> 01:00:29,667
Michael was killed.

755
01:00:31,669 --> 01:00:34,964
If he didn't kill himself,
if he was killed,

756
01:00:35,381 --> 01:00:37,133
who could have done it?

757
01:00:38,051 --> 01:00:38,885
Boss!

758
01:00:42,221 --> 01:00:43,890
Where is O Sang-mi?

759
01:00:44,223 --> 01:00:45,642
She just got released.

760
01:00:46,059 --> 01:00:47,685
What? Released?

761
01:00:48,811 --> 01:00:51,356
The court decided
that she cannot be detained.

762
01:00:53,566 --> 01:00:55,109
Want to bet?

763
01:00:55,193 --> 01:00:56,903
On who goes out first?

764
01:00:57,779 --> 01:00:59,447
I'll be leaving here first.

765
01:01:00,907 --> 01:01:03,618
And you will rot in here until you reek.

766
01:01:24,472 --> 01:01:27,517
TWENTY BILLION TO A SECRET ACCOUNT
BEWARE OF TATTOOED KILLER!

767
01:01:39,696 --> 01:01:42,407
What? Hong didn't go back to the States?

768
01:01:43,032 --> 01:01:45,201
He told me that he's going back,

769
01:01:45,868 --> 01:01:47,787
but I can't find him
on the flight records.

770
01:01:49,831 --> 01:01:53,543
Do you think it's possible
that Hong spread the party video?

771
01:01:54,252 --> 01:01:56,462
But he has no reason to turn on me.

772
01:01:56,546 --> 01:01:59,340
Maybe he does. Think about it carefully.

773
01:02:01,843 --> 01:02:04,053
You have to help me from now on.

774
01:02:04,929 --> 01:02:06,055
Do you have any money?

775
01:02:06,597 --> 01:02:07,724
Aren't you broke now?

776
01:02:14,480 --> 01:02:16,399
You can use everything that's in here.

777
01:02:17,483 --> 01:02:20,111
I wonder how much is in here.

778
01:02:24,157 --> 01:02:27,243
So, what do you want me to do?

779
01:02:27,702 --> 01:02:29,746
First, go after O Sang-mi.

780
01:02:29,829 --> 01:02:32,039
I thought she was in jail.

781
01:02:32,123 --> 01:02:33,332
She was released.

782
01:02:34,083 --> 01:02:35,376
Find out who is behind her.

783
01:02:35,460 --> 01:02:38,379
Okay. Tailing is what I do best.

784
01:02:40,214 --> 01:02:41,883
And here's something more important.

785
01:02:43,760 --> 01:02:46,512
You have to send something
to Cha Dal-geon for me.

786
01:02:46,971 --> 01:02:47,972
What is it?

787
01:02:49,140 --> 01:02:50,308
A bomb?

788
01:02:50,641 --> 01:02:51,517
Boom!

789
01:02:53,478 --> 01:02:56,814
Something more powerful than a bomb.

790
01:02:59,108 --> 01:03:02,028
Here are your sandwiches!

791
01:03:05,948 --> 01:03:08,993
These are all on me,
so have as much as you want.

792
01:03:09,076 --> 01:03:10,369
No way.

793
01:03:10,453 --> 01:03:12,622
This is your business.
We are paying for these.

794
01:03:12,705 --> 01:03:14,791
He's right. I'm paying for this.

795
01:03:14,874 --> 01:03:18,085
-I say we only eat here from now on.
-Yes, agreed.

796
01:03:18,169 --> 01:03:20,588
Businesses must be hard
because of the protests.

797
01:03:20,671 --> 01:03:22,465
-We should help each other.
-Yes.

798
01:03:22,548 --> 01:03:25,510
Then I will send my kids
to your judo gym.

799
01:03:25,593 --> 01:03:27,762
Wow, thank you. I'll teach them well.

800
01:03:27,845 --> 01:03:30,014
Then I'll call Yong-jae's dad
when we move.

801
01:03:30,097 --> 01:03:31,390
Me?

802
01:03:32,683 --> 01:03:33,768
Thank you.

803
01:03:33,851 --> 01:03:36,979
We'll pack your furniture nicely
and move them safely!

804
01:03:38,856 --> 01:03:41,818
Oh, what can we do for Dal-geon?

805
01:03:41,901 --> 01:03:42,902
-Me?
-Yes.

806
01:03:43,402 --> 01:03:44,654
We should get him a wife.

807
01:03:45,112 --> 01:03:46,322
He's hit the age.

808
01:03:47,740 --> 01:03:49,367
You're not a virgin, are you?

809
01:03:49,867 --> 01:03:51,452
That was completely unnecessary.

810
01:03:52,161 --> 01:03:53,162
Look at him blushing!

811
01:03:53,246 --> 01:03:54,580
-You are, aren't you?
-Huh?

812
01:03:54,664 --> 01:03:57,750
-He's really red.
-Are you really a virgin?

813
01:03:57,834 --> 01:03:59,252
-Stop it!
-I'm so sorry!

814
01:04:00,169 --> 01:04:02,213
-Where are you going?
-To the toilet.

815
01:04:04,674 --> 01:04:06,342
I had a feeling but...

816
01:04:11,305 --> 01:04:12,306
MESSAGE

817
01:04:15,768 --> 01:04:19,522
-Me, too! Hey, me too!
-One at a time.
