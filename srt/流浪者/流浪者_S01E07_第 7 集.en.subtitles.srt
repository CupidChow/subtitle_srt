1
00:01:13,865 --> 00:01:18,203
The Ministry of National Defense
proudly announces that we've prioritized

2
00:01:18,828 --> 00:01:23,500
the interest of our nation and our people
in the selection process

3
00:01:24,125 --> 00:01:26,127
of the Next Generation Fighter plan.

4
00:01:26,920 --> 00:01:31,674
President Jeong promised to find out
the truth but has done nothing.

5
00:01:32,175 --> 00:01:36,846
And the National Defense Ministry
is pursuing the F-X plan with John & Mark.

6
00:01:36,930 --> 00:01:38,890
The F-X Plan is directly related

7
00:01:38,973 --> 00:01:43,812
to the 600,000 lives
of our soldiers in the army,

8
00:01:44,104 --> 00:01:47,190
and it will be the pillar
of our national security.

9
00:01:47,565 --> 00:01:50,819
Politicians aren't doing anything
to investigate what happened

10
00:01:51,986 --> 00:01:53,071
or enact a special law

11
00:01:53,947 --> 00:01:56,908
-for the investigation.
-For God's sake.

12
00:01:59,327 --> 00:02:03,414
Our experts have investigated thoroughly
and came to the conclusion

13
00:02:03,998 --> 00:02:08,503
that the Eagle Fighters,
manufactured by John & Mark,

14
00:02:08,878 --> 00:02:13,591
are the most appropriate jets
to our country's situation.

15
00:02:13,716 --> 00:02:17,470
We don't want compensation.

16
00:02:18,096 --> 00:02:19,848
We don't understand

17
00:02:19,931 --> 00:02:24,060
why we had to lose our loved ones
and we want this abnormal situation

18
00:02:25,436 --> 00:02:26,646
to be made right.

19
00:02:28,398 --> 00:02:29,732
The government...

20
00:02:30,191 --> 00:02:34,988
So the Ministry will be delivering
its decision with our utmost loyalty,

21
00:02:35,071 --> 00:02:39,576
to the President,
the commander-in-chief of this country.

22
00:02:50,378 --> 00:02:51,796
Chief Han.

23
00:02:52,714 --> 00:02:55,967
Who do you love more?
Your mother, your father?

24
00:02:56,843 --> 00:02:57,677
Sir?

25
00:02:57,760 --> 00:03:00,889
That's the question
I feel like I am being asked.

26
00:03:01,389 --> 00:03:05,435
From a wider point of view,
I should accept the Ministry's suggestion,

27
00:03:06,895 --> 00:03:09,647
but when I think
of the plane crash victims...

28
00:03:09,731 --> 00:03:14,235
It's not easy to ignore
the grief of our people

29
00:03:15,320 --> 00:03:16,905
as the President.

30
00:03:17,780 --> 00:03:18,656
Lately,

31
00:03:19,699 --> 00:03:21,743
it seems that a lot of people feel

32
00:03:22,202 --> 00:03:25,079
that national interest
should be put first.

33
00:03:25,163 --> 00:03:27,624
That is why I am so troubled.

34
00:03:29,042 --> 00:03:32,337
The bereft families protest,
the objectors protest.

35
00:03:32,420 --> 00:03:36,966
I see our people divided
and fighting against each other,

36
00:03:37,050 --> 00:03:38,509
and it feels as if...

37
00:03:39,969 --> 00:03:43,264
my incompetence has caused this disaster.

38
00:03:44,098 --> 00:03:45,308
It must be difficult,

39
00:03:45,767 --> 00:03:49,812
but I suggest you make a decision
before the wound festers even more.

40
00:03:51,356 --> 00:03:54,776
That is why I have invited our guests,

41
00:03:54,859 --> 00:03:57,278
delegates of every news agency.

42
00:03:57,362 --> 00:04:01,699
Please share with us
what you truly think about this matter.

43
00:04:02,158 --> 00:04:04,661
We need to put our wisdom to good use.

44
00:04:13,378 --> 00:04:17,215
Who is the fellow
that spat nonsense at the end?

45
00:04:17,298 --> 00:04:19,425
He's the SBC newsroom chief.

46
00:04:19,509 --> 00:04:21,928
If you knew he was so slow-witted,

47
00:04:22,011 --> 00:04:24,097
you should've talked to him
before the meeting.

48
00:04:24,180 --> 00:04:27,642
Sorry, sir. He was appointed recently.

49
00:04:27,725 --> 00:04:30,895
We can't let them leave like this.
Go and talk to them.

50
00:04:30,979 --> 00:04:32,855
-Yes, sir.
-Not you, Seo.

51
00:04:32,939 --> 00:04:34,357
Do it yourself, Yun.

52
00:04:35,817 --> 00:04:38,903
Isn't it your responsibility
to deal with the public's opinion?

53
00:04:42,073 --> 00:04:43,032
Let's go.

54
00:04:43,116 --> 00:04:45,201
I talked so much that now I'm hungry.

55
00:04:45,285 --> 00:04:46,119
Yes, sir.

56
00:04:47,829 --> 00:04:48,871
Thank you, guys.

57
00:05:00,675 --> 00:05:05,138
The Minister of National Defense
will take all the blame now.

58
00:05:05,221 --> 00:05:09,600
If John & Mark gets more support
from the public,

59
00:05:09,684 --> 00:05:12,061
the victims' families will calm down, too.

60
00:05:13,229 --> 00:05:14,397
Not that it will happen--

61
00:05:14,480 --> 00:05:16,316
-You can use this, sir.
-Sure.

62
00:05:17,483 --> 00:05:21,237
But what if we get unlucky
and things go wrong?

63
00:05:21,321 --> 00:05:23,197
We have Minister Park to sacrifice.

64
00:05:24,824 --> 00:05:27,785
Is he not the perfect fit
to walk the plank for us?

65
00:05:30,580 --> 00:05:33,374
-I think you're a genius.
-My gosh.

66
00:05:36,377 --> 00:05:38,588
Why aren't you eating? It's good.

67
00:05:38,671 --> 00:05:41,507
I can't digest wheat.

68
00:05:41,883 --> 00:05:43,217
Have some more, boss.

69
00:06:01,861 --> 00:06:04,697
-That guy...
-What? Who is it this time?

70
00:06:06,491 --> 00:06:09,243
I'm Jo Bu-yeong,
a reporter for Pyeonghwa Daily.

71
00:06:10,119 --> 00:06:10,953
Mr. Jo!

72
00:06:11,871 --> 00:06:13,247
He was dead.

73
00:06:13,331 --> 00:06:14,791
Sorry? Who?

74
00:06:16,626 --> 00:06:19,003
Da, Dal-geon!

75
00:06:32,350 --> 00:06:33,476
Mr. Jo Bu-yeong!

76
00:06:40,858 --> 00:06:43,611
Mr. Jo! Mr. Jo Bu-yeong!

77
00:06:48,241 --> 00:06:49,158
Dal-geon.

78
00:06:55,164 --> 00:06:55,998
Are you okay?

79
00:07:02,046 --> 00:07:05,133
A dead man walking in the streets.

80
00:07:05,550 --> 00:07:09,345
I wouldn't believe it
if it weren't from you.

81
00:07:10,930 --> 00:07:13,599
I might have been mistaken.

82
00:07:14,308 --> 00:07:16,060
What if you were not?

83
00:07:19,605 --> 00:07:22,733
If there's a possibility you're right,
we should dig into it.

84
00:07:23,401 --> 00:07:25,987
We shouldn't repeat the mistake
we made in Morocco.

85
00:07:29,740 --> 00:07:31,951
-It's time for your meeting.
-Yes.

86
00:07:33,369 --> 00:07:35,037
Let me look into Reporter Jo.

87
00:07:36,205 --> 00:07:38,416
You can contact me
whenever you need help.

88
00:07:38,958 --> 00:07:40,626
Thank you, as always.

89
00:07:40,710 --> 00:07:41,669
My pleasure.

90
00:07:56,476 --> 00:07:58,895
It's a thing called "trauma."

91
00:07:59,645 --> 00:08:00,646
When...

92
00:08:01,647 --> 00:08:03,608
-When I'm outside
-Yes.

93
00:08:04,233 --> 00:08:07,653
and I see a person who looks
like my wife I freak out.

94
00:08:11,449 --> 00:08:13,242
You should slow down.

95
00:08:13,659 --> 00:08:15,495
Don't worry. Don't worry about me.

96
00:08:17,371 --> 00:08:21,459
Lately, I don't really get drunk.

97
00:08:27,173 --> 00:08:28,007
Hey.

98
00:08:30,593 --> 00:08:34,263
Do you go home every day?

99
00:08:36,432 --> 00:08:37,308
As for me,

100
00:08:37,934 --> 00:08:40,311
I sleep at the gym when I'm not drunk.

101
00:08:42,313 --> 00:08:46,192
I just can't go home when I'm sober.

102
00:08:49,487 --> 00:08:50,530
I'm so stupid.

103
00:08:51,572 --> 00:08:54,450
I keep pressing the doorbell
even though no one's inside.

104
00:08:55,660 --> 00:08:56,494
My gosh.

105
00:09:08,548 --> 00:09:10,091
When will we get better?

106
00:09:13,427 --> 00:09:14,595
The way I see it,

107
00:09:16,556 --> 00:09:19,308
even the government doesn't care about us.

108
00:09:25,189 --> 00:09:26,023
Do you think...

109
00:09:31,112 --> 00:09:35,366
time will heal all wounds?

110
00:09:39,078 --> 00:09:39,912
But...

111
00:09:48,087 --> 00:09:49,213
Gosh...

112
00:09:50,214 --> 00:09:52,508
What if our wounds do really heal?

113
00:09:58,806 --> 00:10:01,267
My wife died so tragically.

114
00:10:03,227 --> 00:10:05,021
If I move on as well,

115
00:10:08,941 --> 00:10:10,776
what about my poor wife?

116
00:10:16,365 --> 00:10:17,783
I miss you, Mi-seon.

117
00:10:19,952 --> 00:10:21,871
Take me with you, Mi-seon.

118
00:10:23,164 --> 00:10:24,874
Let's be together.

119
00:10:44,143 --> 00:10:44,977
Hey.

120
00:10:46,145 --> 00:10:47,104
Kim Ju-yeong.

121
00:10:47,980 --> 00:10:50,274
-Yes.
-Go and get some sleep.

122
00:10:50,358 --> 00:10:51,734
I'm fine.

123
00:10:52,652 --> 00:10:54,904
I'll call you
when Kim Woo-gi turns his phone on.

124
00:10:58,032 --> 00:10:59,450
Okay, thank you.

125
00:11:07,375 --> 00:11:08,292
Girl.

126
00:11:09,126 --> 00:11:12,380
You should stop fiddling with your phone.
If you're so curious,

127
00:11:12,463 --> 00:11:14,048
why don't you just call him?

128
00:11:15,132 --> 00:11:17,802
-What?
-I heard Mr. Gi can take calls now.

129
00:11:18,511 --> 00:11:20,805
Geez, you poor thing.

130
00:11:20,888 --> 00:11:23,808
Why are you so obsessed with him
when he's not into you?

131
00:11:23,891 --> 00:11:25,059
You're wasting yourself.

132
00:11:26,060 --> 00:11:28,604
I'm off to the toilet.
Keep your eye on the signals.

133
00:11:33,734 --> 00:11:35,695
Why isn't he calling?

134
00:11:35,778 --> 00:11:37,780
He should have called
a dozen times by now.

135
00:11:37,863 --> 00:11:38,698
GOOD-FOR-NOTHING

136
00:11:42,243 --> 00:11:44,912
Did I do something wrong that day?

137
00:11:54,171 --> 00:11:56,632
I must have been a nuisance
to you yesterday.

138
00:12:00,970 --> 00:12:02,680
I'll get going, then.

139
00:12:03,806 --> 00:12:04,724
You should eat.

140
00:12:05,891 --> 00:12:06,892
I made pollack soup.

141
00:12:13,566 --> 00:12:16,152
You're right. You made all this.

142
00:12:16,235 --> 00:12:17,862
It'd be rude to just leave.

143
00:12:25,661 --> 00:12:26,787
Man, I feel much better.

144
00:12:27,538 --> 00:12:28,748
You have eye boogers.

145
00:12:31,208 --> 00:12:32,042
All gone?

146
00:12:44,555 --> 00:12:47,099
Did I do something wrong last night?

147
00:12:49,769 --> 00:12:51,353
Shit, I did.

148
00:12:52,271 --> 00:12:53,856
I don't think I threw up.

149
00:12:53,939 --> 00:12:56,567
Did I swear at you?

150
00:12:58,027 --> 00:12:58,903
Hit you?

151
00:12:59,445 --> 00:13:00,279
Not at all.

152
00:13:00,988 --> 00:13:03,574
Then what?
What happened last night?

153
00:13:04,366 --> 00:13:05,242
Nothing happened.

154
00:13:05,326 --> 00:13:06,869
Why aren't you looking at me?

155
00:13:12,666 --> 00:13:13,793
Excuse me.

156
00:13:14,210 --> 00:13:16,921
Put the dishes in the sink
when you're finished.

157
00:13:26,180 --> 00:13:27,932
GOOD-FOR-NOTHING

158
00:13:29,099 --> 00:13:30,267
Screw it.

159
00:13:32,228 --> 00:13:33,062
Hello?

160
00:13:33,854 --> 00:13:36,982
Out of toilet paper here.
Bring me a roll, girl.

161
00:13:38,984 --> 00:13:40,486
My gosh, seriously.

162
00:13:45,741 --> 00:13:47,368
-It's well cooked.
-Yes.

163
00:13:47,451 --> 00:13:50,079
Wow, the smell of meat is so good.

164
00:13:50,204 --> 00:13:51,455
Hey, eat it.

165
00:13:52,331 --> 00:13:54,959
It feels like we're back in North Korea.

166
00:13:55,042 --> 00:13:56,710
We haven't had meat in a while.
Nice.

167
00:13:56,794 --> 00:13:58,838
-Why don't you pour me a drink?
-Have a glass.

168
00:13:59,588 --> 00:14:01,799
Stop cleaning your gun and have a drink.

169
00:14:01,882 --> 00:14:05,052
-Hey, stop doing that for now.
-Pour me a glass.

170
00:14:05,177 --> 00:14:07,179
-I really need a girlfriend.
-Have a glass.

171
00:14:07,263 --> 00:14:08,430
Bring me some meat.

172
00:14:10,099 --> 00:14:13,769
Are you sure we can become
proper NIS agents?

173
00:14:14,436 --> 00:14:15,563
Why do you ask?

174
00:14:15,980 --> 00:14:19,316
I just can't trust Chief Min.

175
00:14:22,444 --> 00:14:24,738
Don't talk like that.

176
00:14:25,281 --> 00:14:28,701
Did you forget who took us in
after Gang Ju-cheol abandoned us?

177
00:14:32,413 --> 00:14:35,040
I'll kill any ungrateful animals
with my bare hands.

178
00:14:56,020 --> 00:14:56,937
Have a bite.

179
00:15:01,025 --> 00:15:02,318
Not hungry?

180
00:15:03,402 --> 00:15:04,236
Is that it?

181
00:15:08,782 --> 00:15:10,200
Then let's cut to the chase.

182
00:15:15,331 --> 00:15:16,874
Where is Kim Woo-gi?

183
00:15:18,250 --> 00:15:19,668
I know you're going to tell me.

184
00:15:20,377 --> 00:15:22,671
Don't regret it after I cripple you.

185
00:15:23,255 --> 00:15:24,423
Talk to me now.

186
00:15:26,467 --> 00:15:28,052
Where is that piece of shit?

187
00:15:29,261 --> 00:15:30,554
I told you I don't know.

188
00:15:32,306 --> 00:15:34,016
How can I tell you what I don't know?

189
00:15:42,900 --> 00:15:45,277
That bitch.
I'm going to kill that bitch.

190
00:15:52,326 --> 00:15:53,535
Don't hurt me!

191
00:15:53,619 --> 00:15:54,453
I'll talk!

192
00:15:55,287 --> 00:15:57,373
Please don't do this!

193
00:16:04,922 --> 00:16:06,298
Hey, come on in.

194
00:16:07,466 --> 00:16:10,177
How can you not have any food
in such a huge house?

195
00:16:10,678 --> 00:16:13,764
You have two big fridges
with nothing in them.

196
00:16:13,847 --> 00:16:15,516
Do you think this is a hotel?

197
00:16:15,599 --> 00:16:17,351
That's really cold.

198
00:16:17,893 --> 00:16:19,937
I wouldn't be here
if it wasn't for you.

199
00:16:26,068 --> 00:16:27,778
Yeah, go on.

200
00:16:31,156 --> 00:16:31,991
What?

201
00:16:33,951 --> 00:16:35,285
Goddamnit.

202
00:16:37,371 --> 00:16:38,205
Alright.

203
00:16:39,540 --> 00:16:41,709
I want you guys to wait there.

204
00:16:44,003 --> 00:16:45,254
What's wrong?

205
00:16:46,588 --> 00:16:50,634
O Sang-mi had a secret burner phone
to call Kim Woo-gi,

206
00:16:51,427 --> 00:16:54,388
and the NIS took it.

207
00:16:55,305 --> 00:16:56,306
What did you just say?

208
00:16:58,767 --> 00:16:59,601
Chief!

209
00:17:00,728 --> 00:17:02,146
-Take a look.
-What is it?

210
00:17:04,314 --> 00:17:07,526
These prove that John & Mark
was involved in the terror attack.

211
00:17:07,609 --> 00:17:11,238
-Where did you get these?
-It was sent by an anonymous source.

212
00:17:16,994 --> 00:17:19,246
-Get an arrest warrant for Jessica.
-Yes, sir.

213
00:17:24,043 --> 00:17:25,753
Frankly speaking,

214
00:17:26,712 --> 00:17:29,006
Gang is responsible
for losing O Sang-mi.

215
00:17:29,923 --> 00:17:30,883
On top of that,

216
00:17:30,966 --> 00:17:34,428
the exact whereabouts of Kim Woo-gi
remain unknown.

217
00:17:34,511 --> 00:17:37,389
Even his request
for Jessica's arrest warrant was denied.

218
00:17:37,848 --> 00:17:40,893
I don't see why Gang should stay
in charge of this case.

219
00:17:40,976 --> 00:17:43,854
Sir, let me lead the TF team.

220
00:17:43,937 --> 00:17:46,982
I think Choi would be
a better fit than Gang.

221
00:17:47,066 --> 00:17:48,859
I agree with him, sir.

222
00:17:48,984 --> 00:17:50,069
We think the same.

223
00:17:50,152 --> 00:17:51,403
We all agreed.

224
00:17:55,115 --> 00:17:57,034
Yes, I got played by Min Jae-sik.

225
00:17:57,117 --> 00:17:59,411
Is that why you take me for a fool?

226
00:18:00,913 --> 00:18:01,830
Choi.

227
00:18:01,914 --> 00:18:03,290
You go find Min Jae-sik.

228
00:18:05,834 --> 00:18:07,461
Park, find O Sang-mi.

229
00:18:07,544 --> 00:18:10,130
Find them within a week,
or you two are fired.

230
00:18:13,008 --> 00:18:14,676
Gang's leading the TF team.

231
00:18:15,761 --> 00:18:18,514
Anyone who has a problem with that
will have to deal with me.

232
00:18:18,889 --> 00:18:20,974
NIS
NATIONAL INTELLIGENCE SERVICE

233
00:18:30,025 --> 00:18:33,987
That's why I told you to make sure
to get the chiefs on your side!

234
00:18:34,071 --> 00:18:35,656
I did!

235
00:18:36,073 --> 00:18:39,284
But Director An is not as soft as before.

236
00:18:39,368 --> 00:18:43,080
If I don't catch you,
he's going to fire me. What should we do?

237
00:18:43,914 --> 00:18:46,250
Hey, the tables will soon turn.

238
00:18:46,333 --> 00:18:48,085
Hang in there a little longer, okay?

239
00:18:49,837 --> 00:18:50,671
Shit.

240
00:18:52,798 --> 00:18:54,758
For Christ's sake.

241
00:18:55,509 --> 00:18:58,011
I almost had things covered.

242
00:18:59,054 --> 00:19:01,682
If they find Kim Woo-gi,
that would be the end of us.

243
00:19:02,141 --> 00:19:04,059
We should call Shadow for help--

244
00:19:04,143 --> 00:19:06,395
Why poke your nose
when you can't take care of it?

245
00:19:06,937 --> 00:19:08,438
You just wasted time.

246
00:19:20,659 --> 00:19:21,618
As I expected,

247
00:19:22,327 --> 00:19:26,248
there may be another mole
in the organization.

248
00:19:27,624 --> 00:19:29,459
Set up the TF team's office outside,

249
00:19:30,294 --> 00:19:31,211
and work in secret.

250
00:19:32,254 --> 00:19:33,297
Yes, sir.

251
00:19:43,265 --> 00:19:46,768
BUILDING GA
ROW BA

252
00:19:48,854 --> 00:19:50,814
Ta-da!
We've reached your destination.

253
00:19:51,481 --> 00:19:54,818
The TF team will be using
the entire building.

254
00:19:54,902 --> 00:19:57,070
The rent was much more expensive
than I thought.

255
00:19:57,821 --> 00:20:00,741
Since we have no idea
who to trust inside the NIS,

256
00:20:00,824 --> 00:20:03,619
The Director ordered us
to work in secret...

257
00:20:15,255 --> 00:20:17,382
Did the accident block his throat?

258
00:20:18,342 --> 00:20:19,760
He's even quieter than before.

259
00:20:28,602 --> 00:20:29,519
There he is.

260
00:20:30,646 --> 00:20:33,190
-Hey, come on in.
-Careful.

261
00:20:36,735 --> 00:20:37,611
Good morning, sir.

262
00:20:40,197 --> 00:20:41,782
You assigned a patient on this job?

263
00:20:42,824 --> 00:20:45,077
You don't need crutches.
Why do you have them?

264
00:20:45,869 --> 00:20:48,413
The doctor told me to take them,
just in case.

265
00:20:48,914 --> 00:20:50,415
I'm totally fine.

266
00:20:53,210 --> 00:20:54,544
Tell me if you find anything.

267
00:20:54,878 --> 00:20:56,171
-Yes.
-Keep up the good work.

268
00:20:57,965 --> 00:20:59,132
-Goodbye, sir.
-Bye, sir.

269
00:21:03,262 --> 00:21:05,347
-Here. Use them.
-It's okay.

270
00:21:05,681 --> 00:21:08,558
We will dispatch an arrest team
as soon as we find where Kim is.

271
00:21:11,144 --> 00:21:13,522
This is the strongest painkiller
I have ever used.

272
00:21:14,606 --> 00:21:16,316
It's expensive. I bought it myself.

273
00:21:17,651 --> 00:21:18,902
Isn't this too harsh?

274
00:21:18,986 --> 00:21:20,070
It is.

275
00:21:20,696 --> 00:21:22,406
But I have no one else to trust.

276
00:21:22,489 --> 00:21:23,407
Chief.

277
00:21:23,490 --> 00:21:27,244
I know you'll do it.
Should I call someone else?

278
00:21:29,663 --> 00:21:30,622
My gosh.

279
00:21:31,290 --> 00:21:33,917
-Kim's phone just turned on!
-What?

280
00:21:46,013 --> 00:21:46,972
Shit.

281
00:21:50,726 --> 00:21:53,312
The estimated location
of Kim Woo-gi is a slum

282
00:21:53,395 --> 00:21:56,940
in the northwest region
of Tánger, Morocco.

283
00:21:57,733 --> 00:21:59,943
We think Kim is hiding

284
00:22:00,402 --> 00:22:03,822
within a three-kilometer radius
of this place.

285
00:22:03,905 --> 00:22:07,284
-Three kilometers?
-Why don't we have the exact coordinates?

286
00:22:07,367 --> 00:22:10,037
That's because this place is
a very deprived area.

287
00:22:10,120 --> 00:22:12,205
Most buildings don't even have
permits,

288
00:22:12,289 --> 00:22:14,624
so it's difficult
to get correct coordinates.

289
00:22:14,708 --> 00:22:17,961
Are you saying we need to go there
and look for him ourselves?

290
00:22:18,045 --> 00:22:20,172
As soon as we enter this zone,

291
00:22:20,255 --> 00:22:22,215
we'll be able to use our equipment

292
00:22:22,299 --> 00:22:24,593
to track the exact location
of Kim Woo-gi.

293
00:22:24,718 --> 00:22:27,471
But Kim's phone needs to be turned on.

294
00:22:29,181 --> 00:22:31,475
Ask the Moroccan Police
for their cooperation.

295
00:22:31,558 --> 00:22:33,310
Get ready and get moving.

296
00:22:33,810 --> 00:22:34,728
Yes, sir.

297
00:22:34,811 --> 00:22:36,104
Is Go Hae-ri going?

298
00:22:40,067 --> 00:22:41,443
Why would you ask that?

299
00:22:41,526 --> 00:22:42,402
She can't go.

300
00:22:42,652 --> 00:22:45,364
This is a serious mission.
I only want to take the best.

301
00:22:46,198 --> 00:22:48,617
Do you know another agent
who knows Morocco like I do?

302
00:22:51,745 --> 00:22:52,579
Take her.

303
00:22:53,663 --> 00:22:57,209
Our agents from nearby areas
will be waiting for you at the airport.

304
00:22:57,626 --> 00:22:59,419
They're trustworthy,
so work with them.

305
00:22:59,503 --> 00:23:00,379
Yes, sir.

306
00:23:12,974 --> 00:23:15,644
Hey, this job is going to be hard as hell.

307
00:23:15,727 --> 00:23:17,771
Why are you dying to go there?

308
00:23:17,854 --> 00:23:20,232
I've contributed so much to this case.

309
00:23:20,357 --> 00:23:21,775
I should see it to the end.

310
00:23:21,858 --> 00:23:24,194
Did you do that alone?
No, Cha Dal-geon did.

311
00:23:24,778 --> 00:23:26,196
I did all the brainwork.

312
00:23:26,279 --> 00:23:27,864
All he did was fight.

313
00:23:29,699 --> 00:23:30,867
Watch me.

314
00:23:30,951 --> 00:23:33,370
I'm going to make Mr. Gi surrender to me.

315
00:23:33,954 --> 00:23:35,705
Okay, fine. Good for you.

316
00:23:36,081 --> 00:23:38,375
By the way, aren't you
going to call Cha Dal-geon?

317
00:23:38,458 --> 00:23:40,919
He'll be really happy to hear this news.

318
00:23:41,044 --> 00:23:43,380
-No need.
-Come to think of it...

319
00:23:44,131 --> 00:23:47,134
He hasn't been calling you lately.

320
00:23:47,801 --> 00:23:48,677
Did you two fight?

321
00:23:48,760 --> 00:23:50,178
No way!

322
00:23:50,679 --> 00:23:53,306
My life is so much better
now that he's not bothering me.

323
00:24:01,606 --> 00:24:03,775
The person you're trying to reach...

324
00:24:04,067 --> 00:24:06,736
GOOD-FOR-NOTHING

325
00:24:11,241 --> 00:24:13,201
PARK KWANG-DEOK

326
00:24:14,453 --> 00:24:15,912
Yes, Hae-ri.

327
00:24:16,663 --> 00:24:17,497
Oh...

328
00:24:17,998 --> 00:24:18,957
Dal-geon?

329
00:24:22,210 --> 00:24:23,879
He's here. Let me get him for you.

330
00:24:23,962 --> 00:24:27,048
-Dal-geon!
-No, that's okay.

331
00:24:27,507 --> 00:24:29,509
As long as he's fine.

332
00:24:31,303 --> 00:24:33,555
Please don't tell him that I called.

333
00:24:34,473 --> 00:24:35,307
Yes.

334
00:25:00,665 --> 00:25:03,001
Oh, Hae-ri. What are you doing here?

335
00:25:07,672 --> 00:25:08,632
See you.

336
00:25:11,760 --> 00:25:14,471
I was wondering
if you could teach me judo.

337
00:25:14,554 --> 00:25:18,433
I have to go and get acupuncture
because I sprained my back.

338
00:25:19,601 --> 00:25:22,729
You should learn from Dal-geon.
He is incredibly good.

339
00:25:22,812 --> 00:25:25,440
Dal-geon! Can you teach Hae-ri?

340
00:25:42,582 --> 00:25:43,416
Let me.

341
00:25:51,258 --> 00:25:54,094
Well, since you know the basics...

342
00:25:55,720 --> 00:25:56,763
Hold my collar.

343
00:26:01,184 --> 00:26:02,227
Okay. Good.

344
00:26:03,186 --> 00:26:04,020
Your right foot--

345
00:26:06,022 --> 00:26:08,149
We found Kim Woo-gi in Morocco.

346
00:26:10,902 --> 00:26:12,988
Jessica's arrest warrant will be issued.

347
00:26:14,155 --> 00:26:15,574
We received a crucial tip-off.

348
00:26:26,751 --> 00:26:28,295
Hold me from behind.

349
00:26:28,878 --> 00:26:31,089
You're the criminal.
I'm the hostage.

350
00:26:31,172 --> 00:26:32,882
Go on. Hold me.

351
00:26:35,677 --> 00:26:36,511
Like this?

352
00:26:38,888 --> 00:26:41,600
Hold tight or you'll fly into the ceiling.

353
00:26:44,853 --> 00:26:46,396
Aren't you glad?

354
00:26:48,523 --> 00:26:50,317
I say it's fantastic news.

355
00:26:53,695 --> 00:26:54,571
Ouch.

356
00:26:59,701 --> 00:27:00,869
As you can see...

357
00:27:02,245 --> 00:27:05,832
If you channel the opponent's force,

358
00:27:06,124 --> 00:27:07,250
you can flip anyone.

359
00:27:07,334 --> 00:27:08,752
I'm the living proof.

360
00:27:08,835 --> 00:27:09,669
Channeling.

361
00:27:10,670 --> 00:27:12,005
That's how it's done.

362
00:27:12,797 --> 00:27:14,382
Hey. Cha Dal-geon!

363
00:27:15,050 --> 00:27:15,967
What?

364
00:27:16,801 --> 00:27:18,219
Can you stop being so awkward?

365
00:27:19,346 --> 00:27:20,221
What do you mean?

366
00:27:20,305 --> 00:27:21,723
Geez.

367
00:27:23,725 --> 00:27:25,268
You have to tell me

368
00:27:25,352 --> 00:27:28,063
what I've done wrong that night,
so I can make it up to you!

369
00:27:29,022 --> 00:27:30,357
You've done nothing wrong.

370
00:27:33,902 --> 00:27:34,778
End of class.

371
00:27:41,201 --> 00:27:42,327
Gosh, it hurts.

372
00:27:54,673 --> 00:27:55,548
Come here!

373
00:27:59,427 --> 00:28:00,428
Get up.

374
00:28:04,307 --> 00:28:05,558
Oh, my God!

375
00:28:15,151 --> 00:28:16,027
Come here.

376
00:28:16,861 --> 00:28:18,154
Come here, you.

377
00:28:19,531 --> 00:28:20,949
Choke!

378
00:28:24,035 --> 00:28:25,036
Whatever.

379
00:28:26,246 --> 00:28:27,539
She doesn't even remember.

380
00:28:28,415 --> 00:28:29,457
Choke!

381
00:28:30,125 --> 00:28:31,501
Choke!

382
00:28:35,171 --> 00:28:37,382
-My gosh.
-It's not over yet.

383
00:28:37,465 --> 00:28:38,466
Choke!

384
00:28:56,025 --> 00:28:56,901
Excuse me.

385
00:28:57,444 --> 00:28:58,820
Someone's looking for you.

386
00:28:59,988 --> 00:29:00,822
Me?

387
00:29:19,466 --> 00:29:20,383
What's going on?

388
00:29:21,092 --> 00:29:23,344
Can't I go on a trip?
It's my own money.

389
00:29:23,762 --> 00:29:26,222
I'm worried you might poke around
and spoil everything.

390
00:29:26,306 --> 00:29:27,640
I'm not spoiling anything.

391
00:29:28,099 --> 00:29:29,267
Don't you know who I am?

392
00:29:29,350 --> 00:29:31,060
I know. God of War.

393
00:29:31,978 --> 00:29:34,230
Hey, I was just a kid when...

394
00:29:34,314 --> 00:29:36,024
Stop talking about my tattoo!

395
00:29:36,107 --> 00:29:37,901
Go back home after we land in Morocco.

396
00:29:38,026 --> 00:29:39,944
If Gi finds out
you'll be forced to anyway.

397
00:29:41,905 --> 00:29:44,824
I'll follow you guys in the dark.
Just answer my calls.

398
00:29:44,908 --> 00:29:46,659
Do you still not trust us?

399
00:29:46,743 --> 00:29:48,369
I won't get in your way!

400
00:29:50,205 --> 00:29:52,123
Staying home drives me crazy.

401
00:29:57,378 --> 00:29:59,756
Give me everything you know
about Kim Woo-gi.

402
00:30:00,340 --> 00:30:03,635
Where he is, how you will catch him,
and what you will do with him.

403
00:30:04,427 --> 00:30:05,261
Okay?

404
00:30:07,263 --> 00:30:09,015
I'll text you when we arrive.

405
00:30:15,146 --> 00:30:16,648
Okay, my ass...

406
00:30:19,818 --> 00:30:21,736
I guess he's back to his old self now.

407
00:30:32,580 --> 00:30:34,666
I was in the toilet. I have constipation.

408
00:30:35,917 --> 00:30:37,836
You don't have to report that.

409
00:30:38,837 --> 00:30:39,671
Yes, sir.

410
00:31:29,345 --> 00:31:31,556
I'll go to the police station
with Go Hae-ri.

411
00:31:32,056 --> 00:31:33,224
You guys can go ahead.

412
00:31:33,766 --> 00:31:34,601
Yes, sir.

413
00:32:10,094 --> 00:32:14,015
I got the request for cooperation,
but it hasn't been approved yet.

414
00:32:15,308 --> 00:32:19,187
They received the cooperation request,
but his superiors haven't approved it yet.

415
00:32:21,439 --> 00:32:24,525
-Ask him when they'll approve it.
-When will they approve it?

416
00:32:25,401 --> 00:32:26,945
I have no idea.

417
00:32:27,028 --> 00:32:28,529
He doesn't know.

418
00:32:29,489 --> 00:32:31,407
Have him call us as soon as it's approved.

419
00:32:33,451 --> 00:32:36,871
You have to stop the investigation
if the residents file a complaint.

420
00:32:37,246 --> 00:32:38,206
What did he say?

421
00:32:38,289 --> 00:32:41,042
If the residents file a complaint,
the investigation stops.

422
00:32:42,418 --> 00:32:43,461
That won't happen.

423
00:32:46,547 --> 00:32:48,466
We will be careful. Don't worry.

424
00:33:49,569 --> 00:33:52,196
Seems like that went well?

425
00:33:58,745 --> 00:34:00,621
When are you going to leave this place?

426
00:34:00,705 --> 00:34:03,791
I told you.
I'm waiting for the perfect timing.

427
00:34:03,875 --> 00:34:07,086
What if we take care of everything
while you sit here waiting?

428
00:34:07,170 --> 00:34:10,840
Well, that's good!
That means everything's taken care of.

429
00:34:13,134 --> 00:34:14,135
Call Shadow.

430
00:34:16,220 --> 00:34:19,098
He should be busy grinding his swords.

431
00:34:20,683 --> 00:34:23,603
-The phone is off...
-His phone's turned off.

432
00:34:24,812 --> 00:34:28,441
Unfortunately, we messed up,
but we are not as sloppy as you think.

433
00:34:29,901 --> 00:34:30,943
Just watch.

434
00:34:31,736 --> 00:34:34,280
It will be one hell of a sword dance.

435
00:34:58,513 --> 00:34:59,889
What took you so long?

436
00:35:01,516 --> 00:35:02,433
Where's the candy?

437
00:35:30,461 --> 00:35:33,589
Get me some water and keep the rest.

438
00:35:41,973 --> 00:35:44,809
O SANG-MI GONE MISSING,
SUSPECTED TO HAVE BEEN KIDNAPPED

439
00:35:46,477 --> 00:35:48,312
THE TRUTH ABOUT B357 PLANE CRASH

440
00:35:50,815 --> 00:35:52,608
KIM WOO-GI, O SANG-MI
BOTH DISAPPEARED

441
00:35:56,028 --> 00:35:57,697
B357 CRASH
ACCIDENT OR TERROR ATTACK?

442
00:35:58,948 --> 00:36:00,575
WHERE IS KIM WOO-GI HIDING?

443
00:36:03,744 --> 00:36:05,121
O WAS USING A BURNER PHONE...

444
00:36:25,308 --> 00:36:28,102
Mr. Gi, Kim's phone is turned off.

445
00:36:28,186 --> 00:36:29,312
What do you mean?

446
00:36:29,395 --> 00:36:31,981
I'm sure we had the signals
when we got in the van.

447
00:36:32,481 --> 00:36:34,859
-But now it's gone.
-Maybe he knows we're here.

448
00:36:34,984 --> 00:36:36,944
O Sang-mi's disappearance is on the news.

449
00:36:37,028 --> 00:36:38,362
-What?
-What?

450
00:36:40,573 --> 00:36:41,741
So that was why.

451
00:36:41,824 --> 00:36:45,620
He's still within a three-kilometer
radius, so we will find him in time.

452
00:36:46,370 --> 00:36:48,164
Why aren't the local cops here?

453
00:36:48,664 --> 00:36:50,791
Procedural delay. It will take time.

454
00:36:52,919 --> 00:36:54,921
Man, I'm about to lose it.

455
00:36:56,881 --> 00:37:00,009
We will divide the area
into three sections.

456
00:37:15,441 --> 00:37:17,777
Section A will be watched
by Robin and Gorilla.

457
00:37:19,779 --> 00:37:22,531
Section B by Mustang and Zombie.

458
00:37:23,699 --> 00:37:25,743
Plato takes the control room.

459
00:37:25,826 --> 00:37:27,078
Section C, report.

460
00:37:30,122 --> 00:37:33,084
Hamster and I will be watching
over Section C.

461
00:37:34,835 --> 00:37:38,506
Drinking water in this area causes
stomachache and diarrhea to Asians.

462
00:37:39,173 --> 00:37:40,007
Which means,

463
00:37:41,092 --> 00:37:43,427
Kim has to be buying
bottles of mineral water.

464
00:37:44,929 --> 00:37:46,430
Check your sections

465
00:37:47,014 --> 00:37:49,850
and find out if an Asian man
has been buying lots of water.

466
00:37:49,934 --> 00:37:50,851
Now move.

467
00:37:51,811 --> 00:37:52,645
Yes, sir.

468
00:37:54,939 --> 00:37:56,607
Um, Mr. Gi?

469
00:37:57,817 --> 00:37:59,402
You haven't mentioned Elsa.

470
00:38:00,111 --> 00:38:01,237
Where should I stakeout?

471
00:38:01,320 --> 00:38:02,571
Can you fetch Korean food?

472
00:38:03,155 --> 00:38:04,740
-Sorry?
-Water and food.

473
00:38:05,241 --> 00:38:06,742
Our men will need plenty of them.

474
00:38:10,037 --> 00:38:12,164
-So you're saying I should--
-Be our backup.

475
00:38:13,416 --> 00:38:15,251
Your job is critical for this operation.

476
00:38:21,924 --> 00:38:24,719
If it's that critical,
someone else can do it.

477
00:38:25,177 --> 00:38:26,846
I don't want to be a delivery girl.

478
00:38:26,929 --> 00:38:28,973
Hey, Elsa. What's up with you?

479
00:38:29,056 --> 00:38:31,809
Why are you chucking me away
before even giving me a chance?

480
00:38:32,476 --> 00:38:34,312
How well do you know about me?

481
00:38:34,395 --> 00:38:37,148
I have as much skill and passion
as the other agents--

482
00:38:37,231 --> 00:38:39,317
Agents like you died in the field.

483
00:38:40,651 --> 00:38:44,238
You are inexperienced,
but overzealous at the same time.

484
00:38:45,656 --> 00:38:46,949
You can always go back home.

485
00:38:47,825 --> 00:38:49,243
My gosh.

486
00:38:51,120 --> 00:38:53,122
God, he didn't have to be so harsh.

487
00:38:53,205 --> 00:38:56,417
Hey, you know he cares about you, right?

488
00:38:56,500 --> 00:38:59,045
He doesn't care about me.
He's trying to screw me over.

489
00:38:59,128 --> 00:39:00,463
Screw over...

490
00:39:01,088 --> 00:39:02,548
Just look at me.

491
00:39:02,631 --> 00:39:04,550
While I was working for Mr. Gi,

492
00:39:04,633 --> 00:39:07,636
I had to babysit my superiors
for six months!

493
00:39:07,720 --> 00:39:09,972
That's how you learn things here.

494
00:39:43,714 --> 00:39:44,590
You startled me!

495
00:39:46,008 --> 00:39:49,095
What is this? Darth Vader?
Is it Halloween?

496
00:39:49,178 --> 00:39:50,888
This is what you call a "disguise."

497
00:39:50,971 --> 00:39:53,015
Look at you.
I recognized you from far away.

498
00:39:53,099 --> 00:39:55,559
It's hard to conceal my beauty.

499
00:39:57,436 --> 00:40:00,064
Why aren't you investigating?
Are you in charge of cooking?

500
00:40:01,190 --> 00:40:03,484
I should be understanding
since you're an amateur.

501
00:40:03,651 --> 00:40:06,946
Just so you know,
I volunteered for this job.

502
00:40:07,446 --> 00:40:08,447
Why?

503
00:40:08,989 --> 00:40:12,243
Koreans don't drink the local water.

504
00:40:12,952 --> 00:40:15,121
Kim Woo-gi will be here
to buy mineral water.

505
00:40:15,871 --> 00:40:18,958
This is valuable intel.
No other agents know about it.

506
00:40:19,041 --> 00:40:20,084
So keep that in mind.

507
00:40:20,167 --> 00:40:23,087
That is no good reason to send
an agent like you

508
00:40:23,170 --> 00:40:24,213
to go grocery shopping.

509
00:40:25,464 --> 00:40:27,716
Your boss must be out of his mind.

510
00:40:27,800 --> 00:40:29,427
Why the sudden compliment?

511
00:40:29,510 --> 00:40:32,680
Who discovered that the plane crash
was a terror attack?

512
00:40:32,763 --> 00:40:33,889
It was you!

513
00:40:33,973 --> 00:40:35,891
The best special agent in the NIS!

514
00:40:38,144 --> 00:40:39,895
Well, not the best...

515
00:40:39,979 --> 00:40:41,564
I just got a little lucky.

516
00:40:42,982 --> 00:40:43,899
Work with me.

517
00:40:45,443 --> 00:40:46,652
If you stake out,

518
00:40:46,735 --> 00:40:49,363
and Kim finds out,
the whole operation will be botched.

519
00:40:49,447 --> 00:40:51,949
But if we work with each other,
and catch the bastard--

520
00:40:55,244 --> 00:40:57,455
So that's what the sweet talk was for.
Move!

521
00:40:59,123 --> 00:41:00,374
My goodness.

522
00:41:00,458 --> 00:41:02,334
Excuse me. My gosh.

523
00:41:08,757 --> 00:41:11,552
The local police are going to help us
with the investigation,

524
00:41:11,802 --> 00:41:13,929
so don't you mess things up. Ever!

525
00:41:16,599 --> 00:41:18,684
I'll be waiting,
in case you change your mind.

526
00:41:23,606 --> 00:41:26,108
-Do you know who this guy is?
-No.

527
00:41:26,442 --> 00:41:28,319
Finish with him and I'll go there.

528
00:41:28,402 --> 00:41:30,404
One second, Ahmed.

529
00:41:33,866 --> 00:41:35,784
-I'm a police officer.
-Yes, sir?

530
00:41:36,619 --> 00:41:38,537
-Do you know who this guy is?
-No, I don't.

531
00:41:38,621 --> 00:41:39,663
Look at his face.

532
00:41:59,725 --> 00:42:01,310
NIS
NATIONAL INTELLIGENCE SERVICE

533
00:42:02,019 --> 00:42:04,146
Who are you people? Leave at once!

534
00:42:09,360 --> 00:42:11,070
A search and seizure warrant for you.

535
00:42:11,820 --> 00:42:13,906
-A warrant?
-Let me see that.

536
00:42:13,989 --> 00:42:16,283
SEARCH WARRANT

537
00:42:16,992 --> 00:42:17,826
Search everywhere.

538
00:42:27,545 --> 00:42:30,422
You are making a serious mistake
right now.

539
00:42:30,506 --> 00:42:31,840
You'll soon find out.

540
00:42:31,924 --> 00:42:33,634
Then let me make another mistake.

541
00:42:33,717 --> 00:42:34,885
Come with me.

542
00:42:35,886 --> 00:42:39,014
Say no. Foreigners don't have to cooperate
as witnesses.

543
00:42:39,098 --> 00:42:40,599
No, not as a witness.

544
00:42:41,809 --> 00:42:45,604
We are arresting you without a warrant
for suspicions regarding the B357 crash.

545
00:42:45,688 --> 00:42:46,981
Arresting me?

546
00:42:47,731 --> 00:42:48,983
You're a lawyer.

547
00:42:49,066 --> 00:42:51,485
You should know
that even foreigners can be arrested.

548
00:42:52,403 --> 00:42:53,988
Let her know her rights.

549
00:42:54,488 --> 00:42:55,322
Yes, sir.

550
00:42:56,532 --> 00:42:59,660
You are now under arrest
for violating the National Security Act.

551
00:43:00,286 --> 00:43:01,662
Hang in there for 48 hours.

552
00:43:01,745 --> 00:43:03,831
If they can't prove your guilt
within 48 hours,

553
00:43:03,956 --> 00:43:05,583
they can't get an arrest warrant.

554
00:43:05,666 --> 00:43:06,875
...file a petition.

555
00:43:35,154 --> 00:43:36,989
The NIS took Jessica.

556
00:43:43,454 --> 00:43:45,080
Is that all you can ever say?

557
00:43:47,750 --> 00:43:49,001
Make your decisions wisely.

558
00:43:50,169 --> 00:43:52,004
Even in the worst case, we will live.

559
00:43:53,255 --> 00:43:54,882
But you will die.

560
00:44:02,014 --> 00:44:05,476
BUILDING GA
ROW NA

561
00:44:20,282 --> 00:44:22,242
What a strange place to meet.

562
00:44:23,702 --> 00:44:25,412
I was called here as a witness.

563
00:44:28,165 --> 00:44:29,083
I don't think

564
00:44:30,459 --> 00:44:32,503
you know enough about me
to be a witness.

565
00:44:34,630 --> 00:44:36,840
These guys are very persistent.

566
00:44:38,801 --> 00:44:39,635
Don't worry.

567
00:44:40,969 --> 00:44:43,013
I haven't told them that we used to

568
00:44:44,014 --> 00:44:44,973
sleep together.

569
00:44:49,478 --> 00:44:51,855
Awkward. I am loving this.

570
00:44:53,982 --> 00:44:55,067
You've changed.

571
00:44:56,026 --> 00:44:59,279
You used to not handle your business
in such a dirty way.

572
00:45:00,322 --> 00:45:02,950
You were never this cruel, either.

573
00:45:03,826 --> 00:45:07,121
Do you think you've won this game?

574
00:45:07,204 --> 00:45:10,541
I never lost to a criminal before.

575
00:45:10,624 --> 00:45:14,586
You should never be sure of anything
in this business.

576
00:45:15,254 --> 00:45:16,588
That's what you taught me.

577
00:45:16,672 --> 00:45:18,882
Don't force things
when they cannot be forced.

578
00:45:19,758 --> 00:45:21,260
I taught you that, too.

579
00:45:21,927 --> 00:45:23,762
It was beneath you to crash that plane.

580
00:45:27,015 --> 00:45:28,142
You know well,

581
00:45:29,226 --> 00:45:30,602
that it wasn't me.

582
00:45:34,064 --> 00:45:36,233
You were handcuffed once before.

583
00:45:37,025 --> 00:45:38,652
Ecuador, I believe.

584
00:45:39,445 --> 00:45:42,781
I was the one
who removed those handcuffs.

585
00:45:44,324 --> 00:45:45,451
Keep in mind.

586
00:45:46,910 --> 00:45:49,246
You will be handcuffed, too.

587
00:45:50,122 --> 00:45:51,081
Very soon.

588
00:45:59,298 --> 00:46:02,468
It's been four hours.
Aren't you going to question her?

589
00:46:02,551 --> 00:46:04,636
I'll heat her up for 40 hours,

590
00:46:05,179 --> 00:46:06,930
and question her for four hours.

591
00:46:20,944 --> 00:46:24,239
We've been searching for six days.
Don't you think this is too reckless?

592
00:46:50,849 --> 00:46:53,435
You can't be a hunter
just because you're good at shooting

593
00:46:53,769 --> 00:46:55,437
or setting traps.

594
00:46:56,897 --> 00:46:58,565
-Do you know who this guy is?
-No.

595
00:46:58,649 --> 00:46:59,650
You don't know?

596
00:47:00,400 --> 00:47:02,069
Who moves first...

597
00:47:02,152 --> 00:47:03,403
Do you know this guy?

598
00:47:03,487 --> 00:47:05,739
-No, sir.
-Look closely at the photo, please.

599
00:47:05,823 --> 00:47:07,574
Okay. I have no idea.

600
00:47:07,658 --> 00:47:09,576
The one who lacks patience loses.

601
00:47:15,791 --> 00:47:18,919
Kim Woo-gi will move soon.

602
00:47:22,297 --> 00:47:23,423
It will be soon.

603
00:47:30,138 --> 00:47:31,223
Thanks.

604
00:47:32,307 --> 00:47:33,892
You're like a real beggar, now.

605
00:47:36,353 --> 00:47:38,438
Wow, you're getting more money.

606
00:47:39,314 --> 00:47:40,399
You must be starving.

607
00:47:41,567 --> 00:47:42,401
My gosh.

608
00:47:47,197 --> 00:47:48,782
No "thank you" anymore?

609
00:47:49,491 --> 00:47:51,410
Are you taking me for granted now?

610
00:47:52,786 --> 00:47:56,331
Cooperation with the local police,
is that ever going to happen?

611
00:47:57,916 --> 00:47:59,418
We're still waiting for approval.

612
00:48:01,753 --> 00:48:04,590
Cooperate with me
and we'll find that guy in a few days.

613
00:48:04,673 --> 00:48:06,717
What nonsense are you going on about?

614
00:48:06,800 --> 00:48:10,012
Going door-to-door is much quicker
than staking out.

615
00:48:10,596 --> 00:48:12,848
Didn't you see how wary the locals are?

616
00:48:13,265 --> 00:48:15,017
They'll never open their doors for us.

617
00:48:15,100 --> 00:48:16,393
I don't need them to.

618
00:48:17,311 --> 00:48:18,145
Are you saying...

619
00:48:19,187 --> 00:48:20,188
you will break in?

620
00:48:21,356 --> 00:48:22,524
What if you get caught?

621
00:48:23,108 --> 00:48:23,942
Hey.

622
00:48:25,110 --> 00:48:26,445
That's why I need your help.

623
00:48:26,862 --> 00:48:29,865
From now on, you can get your own food.

624
00:48:30,866 --> 00:48:34,202
Your teammates are leaving you out
and making you run errands.

625
00:48:34,286 --> 00:48:35,203
Aren't you mad?

626
00:48:35,287 --> 00:48:37,581
I'm not left out by anyone, here!

627
00:48:37,664 --> 00:48:40,250
If you and I team up
and look for that bastard, Kim...

628
00:48:40,876 --> 00:48:42,002
We can catch him!

629
00:48:44,421 --> 00:48:45,547
Wake up.

630
00:48:46,548 --> 00:48:47,883
That's never going to happen.

631
00:48:50,385 --> 00:48:51,261
Wake up.

632
00:49:10,948 --> 00:49:11,823
Uncle.

633
00:49:12,950 --> 00:49:14,326
Uncle!

634
00:49:15,410 --> 00:49:17,496
Wake up and take a shower.

635
00:49:18,538 --> 00:49:20,374
Please wash before you sleep!

636
00:49:21,833 --> 00:49:25,420
God, you didn't brush your teeth for days!
Come on!

637
00:49:26,546 --> 00:49:28,632
Please get up and wash!

638
00:49:29,174 --> 00:49:32,511
You stink. Come on, Uncle! Seriously.

639
00:49:40,727 --> 00:49:41,895
I'm sorry.

640
00:49:43,897 --> 00:49:45,399
I'm so sorry, Hoon.

641
00:49:47,693 --> 00:49:49,403
What are you talking about?

642
00:49:51,154 --> 00:49:52,406
Wake up already!

643
00:49:53,532 --> 00:49:54,950
You're driving me crazy.

644
00:49:55,033 --> 00:49:56,451
Brush your teeth!

645
00:50:50,422 --> 00:50:52,507
CHA DAL-GEON

646
00:50:53,258 --> 00:50:54,092
My gosh.

647
00:51:01,808 --> 00:51:03,101
Help me, Go Hae-ri.

648
00:51:09,357 --> 00:51:10,859
MISSED CALL

649
00:51:11,860 --> 00:51:12,944
My goodness.

650
00:51:13,111 --> 00:51:16,114
So I'm actually hearing his voice now.

651
00:51:24,331 --> 00:51:25,791
Jesus Christ!

652
00:51:31,838 --> 00:51:32,714
Darn it.

653
00:51:40,097 --> 00:51:41,640
Do you want me to get in trouble?

654
00:51:41,723 --> 00:51:43,600
You shouldn't be here!

655
00:51:44,101 --> 00:51:45,602
I've been thinking.

656
00:51:46,728 --> 00:51:48,480
You're the only one who can catch him.

657
00:51:49,314 --> 00:51:50,982
You're really something.

658
00:51:51,358 --> 00:51:53,276
Even my superiors are struggling.

659
00:51:53,360 --> 00:51:54,820
How will I be able to catch him?

660
00:51:54,903 --> 00:51:57,197
They might not be able to,
but I know that you can.

661
00:52:00,367 --> 00:52:01,284
Gosh...

662
00:52:09,751 --> 00:52:11,419
I'll be honest with you.

663
00:52:12,462 --> 00:52:13,713
I'm not a special agent.

664
00:52:15,423 --> 00:52:18,635
I nearly got left out of this operation
because I'm not good enough,

665
00:52:19,469 --> 00:52:22,347
and they only let me come here
because I insisted.

666
00:52:26,226 --> 00:52:28,186
Do you want to know what I do on the team?

667
00:52:29,229 --> 00:52:30,230
I...

668
00:52:38,071 --> 00:52:40,490
Why are you doing this to me?

669
00:52:42,534 --> 00:52:45,370
Why make me admit how pathetic I am?

670
00:52:46,788 --> 00:52:48,707
Who do you think you are?

671
00:53:04,556 --> 00:53:05,390
To me,

672
00:53:07,809 --> 00:53:09,477
you are the best agent in the NIS.

673
00:53:16,151 --> 00:53:18,320
You're the most brave,

674
00:53:20,113 --> 00:53:21,281
the most righteous,

675
00:53:22,782 --> 00:53:23,950
and the most competent.

676
00:53:28,079 --> 00:53:29,080
Promotion?

677
00:53:29,456 --> 00:53:30,582
Let it go.

678
00:53:31,499 --> 00:53:33,793
This isn't a case
a nobody like you can solve.

679
00:53:33,877 --> 00:53:35,462
Don't you think I can do it?

680
00:53:37,756 --> 00:53:38,590
You can't.

681
00:53:38,673 --> 00:53:40,884
Agents like you died in the field.

682
00:53:40,967 --> 00:53:42,385
You are inexperienced,

683
00:53:43,345 --> 00:53:44,971
but overzealous at the same time.

684
00:53:49,559 --> 00:53:50,727
You got me wrong.

685
00:53:51,353 --> 00:53:53,271
-I was never--
-I didn't get you wrong.

686
00:53:56,024 --> 00:53:57,442
Everyone else got you wrong.

687
00:53:57,525 --> 00:53:58,652
Even yourself.

688
00:54:10,580 --> 00:54:14,918
Are you saying that John & Mark
is controlling the local police?

689
00:54:15,669 --> 00:54:17,712
I bet they are delaying the investigation.

690
00:54:18,338 --> 00:54:20,340
Don't give them any reason
to hinder us.

691
00:54:21,633 --> 00:54:23,510
I knew something was up since...

692
00:54:23,593 --> 00:54:26,012
Oh, thanks. Give me some, too.

693
00:54:26,096 --> 00:54:28,556
We should talk to the police
and do something about it.

694
00:54:28,640 --> 00:54:31,476
-Otherwise, this is never going to work.
-Um, Mr. Gi?

695
00:54:32,727 --> 00:54:36,106
Since Kim Woo-gi hasn't shown up
until now,

696
00:54:36,481 --> 00:54:39,401
don't you think he hired someone
to deliver him water?

697
00:54:41,778 --> 00:54:45,115
Instead of using drones or staking out,
we should ask the locals--

698
00:54:45,198 --> 00:54:46,950
The locals are unkind to foreigners.

699
00:54:48,201 --> 00:54:50,745
Do you think
they will give us any information?

700
00:54:50,829 --> 00:54:53,123
I know these people better than anyone.

701
00:54:53,206 --> 00:54:55,000
They are not always unkind--

702
00:54:55,083 --> 00:54:56,126
I'm warning you.

703
00:54:57,252 --> 00:54:58,545
Just stick to your orders.

704
00:54:59,004 --> 00:55:01,381
If Kim finds out
that we've been poking around,

705
00:55:01,756 --> 00:55:02,966
it's game over.

706
00:55:03,049 --> 00:55:05,343
Let's increase
the number of drone searches.

707
00:55:05,969 --> 00:55:07,721
-Yes, sir.
-Bye, sir.

708
00:55:08,722 --> 00:55:10,890
Man, she's making me feel anxious.

709
00:55:10,974 --> 00:55:13,560
Just do as you are told.
Don't step out of your line.

710
00:55:14,311 --> 00:55:17,063
Let's not be so mean.
Rookies are scary these days.

711
00:55:17,772 --> 00:55:19,691
My gosh.

712
00:55:19,774 --> 00:55:22,235
Those guys have been so on edge lately.

713
00:55:22,319 --> 00:55:24,279
Don't get discouraged.

714
00:55:24,362 --> 00:55:25,905
I'm not.

715
00:55:28,116 --> 00:55:30,785
Can you share with me
the drone search schedule?

716
00:55:31,077 --> 00:55:33,079
I want to learn how to do my job properly.

717
00:55:33,163 --> 00:55:34,914
Sure. Okay!

718
00:55:35,957 --> 00:55:39,002
The Go Hae-ri I know
would never feel down for these things.

719
00:55:39,210 --> 00:55:40,503
I'll give you the schedule.

720
00:55:41,087 --> 00:55:42,088
Thank you.

721
00:55:47,677 --> 00:55:49,095
It's me, Dal-geon.

722
00:55:50,138 --> 00:55:53,099
There will be more drone searches.
Try not to get caught.

723
00:56:02,108 --> 00:56:03,318
Two on the ground floor.

724
00:56:04,652 --> 00:56:05,945
Zero on the second floor.

725
00:56:08,156 --> 00:56:10,575
Let's see. One on the third floor.

726
00:56:10,658 --> 00:56:13,870
Judging by their physiques,
the two on the ground floor are women.

727
00:56:14,746 --> 00:56:16,873
The man on the third floor
seems to be asleep.

728
00:56:17,207 --> 00:56:18,041
Okay.

729
00:56:41,815 --> 00:56:43,108
HAMSTER

730
00:56:46,319 --> 00:56:47,320
Yes.

731
00:56:47,404 --> 00:56:49,239
Are you bringing the entire supermarket?

732
00:56:49,697 --> 00:56:52,033
Hurry up, I'm starving!

733
00:56:52,117 --> 00:56:53,076
I'm on my--

734
00:56:55,120 --> 00:56:58,164
Do they really need to have
three meals a day out here?

735
00:57:00,750 --> 00:57:01,584
He's not here.

736
00:57:08,716 --> 00:57:09,926
I'll check next door.

737
00:57:10,718 --> 00:57:12,762
I got called in.
They are having a meeting.

738
00:57:12,887 --> 00:57:14,180
Take a rest while I'm gone.

739
00:57:15,348 --> 00:57:16,683
When do the drones pass here?

740
00:57:18,435 --> 00:57:20,812
Well... after about an hour?

741
00:57:21,479 --> 00:57:22,772
Are you going to work alone?

742
00:57:22,856 --> 00:57:24,566
I'll be careful. Get here fast.

743
00:58:07,775 --> 00:58:10,153
Mr. Gi, take a look at this.

744
00:58:10,570 --> 00:58:11,988
Look at this guy.

745
00:58:20,955 --> 00:58:23,541
-A thief?
-He's moving in and out of buildings,

746
00:58:23,625 --> 00:58:26,085
so I don't think so,
but he is very quick.

747
00:58:26,753 --> 00:58:27,754
Catch him.

748
00:58:33,593 --> 00:58:35,220
-Start the car!
-Yes, sir!

749
00:58:45,396 --> 00:58:46,439
What's going on?

750
00:58:47,106 --> 00:58:48,900
There's a strange man on sight.

751
00:59:27,814 --> 00:59:29,399
Darn it!

752
00:59:32,610 --> 00:59:34,237
Why am I seeing a drone here?

753
00:59:34,320 --> 00:59:36,739
They must have changed the patrol time.
Run away!

754
00:59:43,621 --> 00:59:45,123
I found bottles of mineral water.

755
00:59:46,457 --> 00:59:47,542
Do you see Kim Woo-gi?

756
00:59:50,587 --> 00:59:53,172
Not from here. I'll go inside.

757
00:59:53,256 --> 00:59:54,924
My teammates will be there soon.

758
00:59:55,508 --> 00:59:57,302
If Kim's not there, we are both--

759
00:59:57,385 --> 00:59:59,887
-But if he is, it's a jackpot.
-Dal-geon...

760
01:00:00,555 --> 01:00:01,431
If you get caught--

761
01:00:01,514 --> 01:00:03,391
I did this alone. Play dumb.

762
01:00:06,728 --> 01:00:08,229
Shit!

763
01:00:27,749 --> 01:00:29,917
Sorry, doors are always closed.

764
01:00:30,877 --> 01:00:34,505
-Are you the owner?
-Yes, sir. I'm sorry I didn't hear...

765
01:00:34,589 --> 01:00:35,757
Ok, sir. Go ahead.

766
01:00:38,343 --> 01:00:39,802
It seems it's not the right key.

767
01:00:58,571 --> 01:00:59,405
Come in.

768
01:01:07,705 --> 01:01:08,706
Who are you?

769
01:01:12,669 --> 01:01:14,170
What are you looking for in here?

770
01:01:25,390 --> 01:01:27,266
Can't we just talk in Korean?

771
01:01:34,982 --> 01:01:36,192
Mr. Kim Woo-gi.

772
01:01:45,660 --> 01:01:48,579
