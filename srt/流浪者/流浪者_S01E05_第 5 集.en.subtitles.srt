00:01:13,114 --> 00:01:15,575
SMALL HEART CONCERT
FOR CHILDREN WITH RARE DISEASES

2
00:01:15,658 --> 00:01:17,660
Are you willing to go on the record?

3
00:01:17,744 --> 00:01:20,455
Hey, mister, didn't you hear me?

4
00:01:20,538 --> 00:01:25,668
The man at the repair shop said that
they did something to my car.

5
00:01:25,752 --> 00:01:26,878
Did you see the car?

6
00:01:26,961 --> 00:01:28,963
I nearly got killed!

7
00:01:29,255 --> 00:01:34,010
As for the details,
Dal-geon will come out and fill you in.

8
00:01:34,094 --> 00:01:36,638
Please wait here. Don't go anywhere.

9
00:01:37,388 --> 00:01:40,600
-Okay.
-Show me the photo. Something's up here.

10
00:01:45,522 --> 00:01:46,856
This is chamomile tea.

11
00:01:47,524 --> 00:01:51,694
I heard that it calms you down,
so I asked the director to bring us some.

12
00:01:52,320 --> 00:01:53,196
You should drink up.

13
00:01:55,573 --> 00:01:57,408
You need it more than I do.

14
00:01:58,076 --> 00:01:59,828
How much did Dynamic pay you?

15
00:02:02,455 --> 00:02:03,957
What the hell are you talking about?

16
00:02:04,040 --> 00:02:06,960
The world may be ever-changing,
but some things never change.

17
00:02:08,086 --> 00:02:11,881
Like how money is power,
and power makes things become a reality.

18
00:02:13,174 --> 00:02:15,885
This isn't a fight that you should be
getting yourself involved in.

19
00:02:16,928 --> 00:02:20,473
So... it was because of money...

20
00:02:21,766 --> 00:02:23,393
and because you were power-hungry...

21
00:02:26,271 --> 00:02:27,605
that you killed all those people?

22
00:02:27,856 --> 00:02:29,732
We didn't do it.

23
00:02:31,317 --> 00:02:34,612
I can't even watch the news
because it makes me cry.

24
00:02:34,696 --> 00:02:36,948
I know you killed Vice President Michael.

25
00:02:39,534 --> 00:02:42,162
And you killed Jo Bu-yeong,
the reporter from Pyeonghwa Daily.

26
00:02:44,330 --> 00:02:48,626
It seems to me that
you're in need of some serious help.

27
00:02:50,253 --> 00:02:54,883
You're not just grieving,
you've become overwhelmed by your grief.

28
00:03:05,768 --> 00:03:09,189
Didn't anyone ever tell you that
it's wise to have morals?

29
00:03:13,151 --> 00:03:14,777
You people are idiots.

30
00:03:15,820 --> 00:03:17,614
You messed with the wrong guy.

31
00:03:18,948 --> 00:03:20,074
Watch out.

32
00:03:21,659 --> 00:03:23,828
I'm going to suck you people dry,
right down to the marrow.

33
00:03:23,912 --> 00:03:24,996
Mr. Cha...

34
00:03:27,707 --> 00:03:29,542
how can I help you?

35
00:03:30,919 --> 00:03:32,420
I feel so sorry for you.

36
00:03:36,925 --> 00:03:38,009
Bring Hoon...

37
00:03:40,929 --> 00:03:41,971
back to life.

38
00:03:54,776 --> 00:03:57,195
The car is ready, ma'am.
You can head out the back.

39
00:03:58,279 --> 00:04:02,367
What happened to the reporter
from Pyeonghwa Daily?

40
00:04:02,450 --> 00:04:05,411
He overstepped his boundaries
while investigating the case.

41
00:04:05,495 --> 00:04:08,581
-If we had left him--
-So you took him out without telling me?

42
00:04:09,874 --> 00:04:12,335
Don't you realize that we're standing
on the edge of a precipice?

43
00:04:12,585 --> 00:04:15,296
I took care of the matter
with the utmost care, so don't worry.

44
00:04:18,299 --> 00:04:21,177
-Bring the car to the front.
-You'll be hassled by the reporters.

45
00:04:21,261 --> 00:04:23,179
It'll seem more suspicious
if I avoid them.

46
00:04:25,390 --> 00:04:27,308
I need to act confident.

47
00:04:30,603 --> 00:04:34,315
So you're saying that John & Mark
is responsible for the B357 crash.

48
00:04:34,399 --> 00:04:36,109
-Is that it?
-Yes.

49
00:04:36,192 --> 00:04:38,403
And what evidence do you have?

50
00:04:38,528 --> 00:04:39,946
There's a video.

51
00:04:40,613 --> 00:04:43,157
The NIS has the video evidence
that can prove my point!

52
00:04:44,200 --> 00:04:46,828
If he's telling the truth,
this is shocking news!

53
00:04:46,911 --> 00:04:49,455
You should check with the NIS, then.

54
00:04:51,416 --> 00:04:55,461
This is not the first time
our company has heard this claim.

55
00:04:55,545 --> 00:04:59,340
But none of those accusations
were found to be true.

56
00:05:00,049 --> 00:05:01,217
Excuse us. Let us through.

57
00:05:01,592 --> 00:05:02,468
Excuse us.

58
00:05:02,969 --> 00:05:04,345
-Just a moment!
-Sorry.

59
00:05:04,429 --> 00:05:07,724
And when Mr. Cha's claim is proved false,

60
00:05:08,182 --> 00:05:10,518
please don't publish
any critical articles about him.

61
00:05:11,602 --> 00:05:13,896
He lost a family member in the accident.

62
00:05:14,147 --> 00:05:16,899
I completely understand how he must feel.

63
00:05:39,797 --> 00:05:41,215
Yes, this is the emergency call center.

64
00:05:41,299 --> 00:05:43,509
Yes, we've checked
and there's no such video.

65
00:05:43,634 --> 00:05:46,346
I have no idea
why that man is saying that.

66
00:05:46,429 --> 00:05:50,099
-No, we're not investigating that.
-I'm telling you, that's false.

67
00:05:50,767 --> 00:05:52,810
I told you to keep Cha's mouth shut.

68
00:05:53,144 --> 00:05:55,855
What the hell were you doing
while he was blabbing

69
00:05:55,938 --> 00:05:57,982
in front of all those reporters?

70
00:05:58,816 --> 00:06:01,277
But it's not like he made anything up.

71
00:06:01,986 --> 00:06:04,280
Since it's come to this,
shouldn't we launch a proper--?

72
00:06:04,364 --> 00:06:06,157
You got real ballsy
while you were in Morocco, huh?

73
00:06:07,367 --> 00:06:08,451
For crying out loud.

74
00:06:08,534 --> 00:06:10,370
CHIEF MIN JAE-SIK

75
00:06:13,623 --> 00:06:15,458
Yes, director.

76
00:06:17,085 --> 00:06:19,754
Yes, sir. Understood.

77
00:06:22,382 --> 00:06:25,301
Damn it, why do I have to deal
with the reporters--?

78
00:06:25,385 --> 00:06:27,804
This is all your fault, damn it!

79
00:06:28,429 --> 00:06:30,848
I'm going to send you to an area
with a lot of rebel forces,

80
00:06:31,391 --> 00:06:34,727
so if you don't want to get shot there,
bring me your resignation letter.

81
00:06:37,188 --> 00:06:38,064
Get out.

82
00:06:38,773 --> 00:06:39,690
Get out!

83
00:06:48,783 --> 00:06:51,035
You're one step away from being fired.

84
00:06:51,369 --> 00:06:52,495
What's your plan?

85
00:06:52,703 --> 00:06:54,872
Once it gets in the news,
the police will get involved.

86
00:06:55,665 --> 00:06:57,458
We have to take the lead.

87
00:06:58,251 --> 00:06:59,502
Where are you going?

88
00:06:59,585 --> 00:07:02,255
I'm going to die an early death
because of you.

89
00:07:37,248 --> 00:07:38,124
Yes.

90
00:07:42,003 --> 00:07:43,504
What brings you here?

91
00:07:43,588 --> 00:07:45,339
Did you see the photos I sent you?

92
00:07:47,675 --> 00:07:49,802
Well, more or less.

93
00:07:49,886 --> 00:07:53,389
I think Michael's death
is somehow related to the plane crash.

94
00:07:54,765 --> 00:07:55,641
So?

95
00:07:56,476 --> 00:07:58,853
How long are you going to let
Chief Min push you around?

96
00:07:59,562 --> 00:08:01,355
Just let us help, and--

97
00:08:04,817 --> 00:08:10,031
The incompetent one,
the obnoxious one, and the toothless one.

98
00:08:10,114 --> 00:08:12,241
-What could we accomplish?
-Chief...

99
00:08:12,533 --> 00:08:15,953
I know who the incompetent one is,
and I know who the toothless one is.

100
00:08:16,037 --> 00:08:17,246
Am I--?

101
00:08:17,330 --> 00:08:19,999
You said there was something off
about Michael's suicide.

102
00:08:20,082 --> 00:08:21,501
That and nothing more.

103
00:08:22,168 --> 00:08:24,462
I was just curious
about my friend's death.

104
00:08:24,545 --> 00:08:25,379
Get out of here.

105
00:08:27,006 --> 00:08:29,842
If we were to solve this case,
you'd get a special two-rank promotion.

106
00:08:29,926 --> 00:08:30,885
A promotion?

107
00:08:32,637 --> 00:08:33,763
Let it go.

108
00:08:34,388 --> 00:08:36,641
This isn't a case
a nobody like you can solve.

109
00:08:37,642 --> 00:08:40,144
-Chief!
-Let's just go.

110
00:08:40,478 --> 00:08:42,063
When did you become such a coward?

111
00:08:42,146 --> 00:08:45,525
What? A coward? You rude little--

112
00:08:45,608 --> 00:08:47,777
This is not like you at all.

113
00:08:47,860 --> 00:08:49,487
-I'm so disappointed in you!
-Come on.

114
00:08:49,987 --> 00:08:52,031
-Don't touch me!
-Have a nice day, sir!

115
00:08:52,114 --> 00:08:53,199
Let me go!

116
00:09:16,681 --> 00:09:18,182
Michael was murdered.

117
00:09:19,850 --> 00:09:23,563
A left-handed person couldn't pull
the trigger with their right hand.

118
00:09:23,896 --> 00:09:26,649
Check all the places
Michael went to in Portugal.

119
00:09:33,990 --> 00:09:37,326
Did you know that the president invited us
to the Blue House tomorrow?

120
00:09:39,161 --> 00:09:41,539
-What time?
-But it's not for all of us.

121
00:09:41,622 --> 00:09:43,416
Only a handful were picked to go.

122
00:09:44,709 --> 00:09:47,378
If I'd known this would happen,
I would've recommended you over me.

123
00:09:47,461 --> 00:09:48,796
B357 PLANE CRASH

124
00:09:48,879 --> 00:09:50,131
Are there any articles yet?

125
00:09:52,258 --> 00:09:53,384
Not even one.

126
00:09:53,467 --> 00:09:56,137
What?
But they were all so worked up back there.

127
00:09:58,139 --> 00:10:00,308
Do you think that woman
got to them already?

128
00:10:04,228 --> 00:10:05,563
GOOD-FOR-NOTHING

129
00:10:10,026 --> 00:10:11,652
Is it Cha Dal-geon again?

130
00:10:12,111 --> 00:10:14,155
What can we accomplish on our own?

131
00:10:14,488 --> 00:10:18,200
You should just come clean with him.

132
00:10:20,036 --> 00:10:22,038
The person you are trying to reach...

133
00:10:24,915 --> 00:10:25,791
GOOD-FOR-NOTHING

134
00:10:25,875 --> 00:10:26,917
SIX MISSED CALLS

135
00:10:27,793 --> 00:10:30,129
You have a friend in the Inspection Team.
Se-hun, right?

136
00:10:30,546 --> 00:10:32,673
He's not exactly a friend. Why do you ask?

137
00:10:32,757 --> 00:10:34,091
I'm going to find the video.

138
00:10:35,009 --> 00:10:35,843
How?

139
00:10:37,261 --> 00:10:38,429
UNEMPLOYED LIL BRO

140
00:10:41,849 --> 00:10:44,018
-What?
-Big trouble, sis.

141
00:10:44,685 --> 00:10:47,104
Someone in Mom's collection pool
ran off with the money.

142
00:10:47,188 --> 00:10:49,607
Mom's in charge of it,
so she has to repay everyone.

143
00:10:50,107 --> 00:10:52,318
Why does she
keep getting herself into trouble?

144
00:10:52,401 --> 00:10:55,154
I don't know!
She needs five million won right now.

145
00:10:55,237 --> 00:10:57,865
-Do you have any money?
-Of course I don't!

146
00:10:57,948 --> 00:10:59,408
Tell her to sort it out herself!

147
00:11:07,833 --> 00:11:09,752
You have a crappy life too.

148
00:11:11,170 --> 00:11:13,506
Jeez. Are you okay?

149
00:11:19,512 --> 00:11:21,097
Do you still want me to meet with Se-hun?

150
00:11:26,060 --> 00:11:26,936
-Cheers!
-Cheers!

151
00:11:27,019 --> 00:11:28,688
Bottoms up, okay?

152
00:11:28,771 --> 00:11:30,523
What? Again?

153
00:11:30,981 --> 00:11:32,358
Why are you pushing me so hard?

154
00:11:32,441 --> 00:11:34,944
What are you planning to do to me
once you get me drunk?

155
00:11:35,486 --> 00:11:38,072
Why, are you scared?

156
00:11:38,155 --> 00:11:39,615
Scared of you?

157
00:11:39,990 --> 00:11:42,660
You scare me all the time,
even when you're not drunk.

158
00:11:43,244 --> 00:11:44,412
Oh, God!

159
00:11:45,830 --> 00:11:48,874
Stop blathering, and just drink up!

160
00:11:52,461 --> 00:11:54,296
Oh, goodness!

161
00:11:58,300 --> 00:11:59,969
Where do you think you're going?

162
00:12:00,678 --> 00:12:02,304
Are you running away already?

163
00:12:02,388 --> 00:12:04,682
I'm just going to take a piss.
You can't stop me!

164
00:12:04,765 --> 00:12:08,227
What kind of man has such a small bladder?

165
00:12:08,310 --> 00:12:11,897
What did you say? A small bladder?

166
00:12:11,981 --> 00:12:14,608
You shouldn't have gone there.

167
00:12:14,692 --> 00:12:19,196
You'll be in for it when I get back. Okay?

168
00:12:23,784 --> 00:12:26,704
I don't even know why I'm doing this.

169
00:12:29,707 --> 00:12:30,875
Thanks.

170
00:12:39,675 --> 00:12:42,845
This chicken's so good!
This is a fantastic chicken place!

171
00:12:55,149 --> 00:12:56,901
NIS

172
00:13:04,867 --> 00:13:06,368
Hey, stop right there.

173
00:13:08,245 --> 00:13:09,330
Who's there?

174
00:13:17,338 --> 00:13:18,172
Go Hae-ri?

175
00:13:20,841 --> 00:13:23,385
What are you doing here
in the middle of the night?

176
00:13:24,345 --> 00:13:26,388
It's not like this is a night school.

177
00:13:27,056 --> 00:13:28,182
Do I need your permission to be here?

178
00:13:28,265 --> 00:13:31,644
I'm just asking because
there's no reason for you to be here.

179
00:13:33,646 --> 00:13:36,023
I'm here to write my resignation letter.
Happy?

180
00:13:36,106 --> 00:13:39,944
For God's sake,
that was just my temper speaking.

181
00:13:40,945 --> 00:13:44,907
Why can't you use your brain for once?

182
00:13:44,990 --> 00:13:46,659
Haven't you noticed
how things are these days?

183
00:13:47,952 --> 00:13:50,538
There's no point in working hard.

184
00:13:50,621 --> 00:13:52,915
And you'll get hurt
if you don't mind your own business.

185
00:13:52,998 --> 00:13:57,253
You get paid for doing nothing.
What's better than that?

186
00:13:58,003 --> 00:14:00,047
It's best to be average.

187
00:14:01,006 --> 00:14:04,343
You're lucky you have a boss like me
to give you advice like this.

188
00:14:05,553 --> 00:14:06,804
I'll take note, sir.

189
00:14:07,054 --> 00:14:08,764
Yeah, you do that.

190
00:14:10,808 --> 00:14:12,351
I don't hate you.

191
00:14:13,269 --> 00:14:14,770
I just feel bad for you.

192
00:15:38,103 --> 00:15:39,563
GO HAE-RI

193
00:15:42,274 --> 00:15:44,860
-What's up?
-I have something to tell you.

194
00:15:45,569 --> 00:15:46,570
Where are you?

195
00:15:47,488 --> 00:15:49,323
-Is this urgent?
-Yes.

196
00:15:49,823 --> 00:15:51,116
I need to meet you now.

197
00:15:52,993 --> 00:15:55,162
I'll text you an address.
Let's meet there.

198
00:16:19,019 --> 00:16:20,187
WOULD YOU LIKE TO DELETE THIS
VIDEO RECORDING?

199
00:16:20,270 --> 00:16:21,313
DELETING VIDEO

200
00:16:39,039 --> 00:16:41,583
Keep this brief.
This place is about to close.

201
00:16:41,917 --> 00:16:43,210
Explain to me...

202
00:16:44,586 --> 00:16:48,674
why the flash drive your team took
is infected with a virus.

203
00:16:50,968 --> 00:16:53,971
-How do you know that?
-I saw it with my own eyes.

204
00:16:56,223 --> 00:16:58,017
Then why do you need an explanation?

205
00:16:59,893 --> 00:17:01,520
Are you going to cover this up?

206
00:17:06,358 --> 00:17:08,986
The plane crash killed 211 people.

207
00:17:09,069 --> 00:17:12,281
Those were the director's orders.
We have to follow them.

208
00:17:12,364 --> 00:17:14,950
"Silently devote yourself
to this nation and its citizens.

209
00:17:15,451 --> 00:17:18,120
Such is the pride and duty of an agent."

210
00:17:19,747 --> 00:17:22,791
You're the one who kept on
drilling that into my head.

211
00:17:24,585 --> 00:17:26,170
Why have you changed?

212
00:17:26,420 --> 00:17:27,880
If you think you can do it...

213
00:17:29,256 --> 00:17:30,883
then go and expose this yourself.

214
00:17:31,925 --> 00:17:33,302
You don't think I can do it?

215
00:17:33,385 --> 00:17:34,428
You can't.

216
00:17:37,556 --> 00:17:38,474
You know you can't.

217
00:18:11,799 --> 00:18:13,717
-Oh, God.
-Did you have a lot to drink?

218
00:18:15,636 --> 00:18:17,763
Look at me. I look wasted, right?

219
00:18:18,555 --> 00:18:19,973
She completely fell for it.

220
00:18:21,058 --> 00:18:23,519
Man, I should have been an actor.

221
00:18:23,811 --> 00:18:25,479
Give this to Assemblyman Lee Sang-bok.

222
00:18:25,896 --> 00:18:28,065
They'll be more influential
than the prosecutor's office.

223
00:18:28,565 --> 00:18:31,485
He's on a business trip to Japan
and won't be back until the weekend.

224
00:18:31,819 --> 00:18:34,780
Mr. Gi... do you really need to do this?

225
00:18:34,863 --> 00:18:36,532
You can back out if you want.

226
00:18:38,492 --> 00:18:41,328
Not a nice thing to say to a man
who always carries a resignation letter.

227
00:18:42,871 --> 00:18:46,083
What if Go Hae-ri decides
to leak this to the press?

228
00:18:46,500 --> 00:18:48,585
She doesn't have the skill
or the courage to do that.

229
00:18:49,044 --> 00:18:50,504
Even if she does talk,

230
00:18:51,213 --> 00:18:53,340
we can always deny it.

231
00:18:56,218 --> 00:18:58,512
Keep this brief.
This place is about to close.

232
00:18:58,720 --> 00:18:59,596
Explain to me...

233
00:19:00,514 --> 00:19:04,768
why the flash drive your team took
is infected with a virus.

234
00:19:05,561 --> 00:19:08,438
-How do you know that?
-I saw it with my own eyes.

235
00:19:08,564 --> 00:19:09,439
GOOD-FOR-NOTHING

236
00:19:21,410 --> 00:19:23,078
-Yeah?
-Where are you?

237
00:19:29,835 --> 00:19:31,420
Are you kidding me?

238
00:19:32,212 --> 00:19:33,297
How can it be gone?

239
00:19:34,506 --> 00:19:35,674
It was infected by a virus.

240
00:19:37,050 --> 00:19:38,886
You don't believe that, do you?

241
00:19:39,678 --> 00:19:40,846
So what if I don't?

242
00:19:43,473 --> 00:19:46,101
Don't you remember what happened
after we came back to Korea?

243
00:19:46,185 --> 00:19:48,061
A reporter died right in front of me.

244
00:19:48,145 --> 00:19:50,689
-They're trying to kill me!
-I know.

245
00:19:52,774 --> 00:19:53,817
So what?

246
00:19:53,901 --> 00:19:57,362
This means there's a mole inside the NIS
working for John & Mark.

247
00:19:57,738 --> 00:19:59,656
We have to find out who that is!

248
00:20:00,616 --> 00:20:02,242
I don't have that kind of power.

249
00:20:06,705 --> 00:20:09,333
What about O Sang-mi?
Who's investigating her?

250
00:20:11,001 --> 00:20:12,085
There is no investigation.

251
00:20:21,762 --> 00:20:23,013
Shit.

252
00:20:24,306 --> 00:20:28,060
You told me that you serve the citizens.

253
00:20:29,311 --> 00:20:31,855
You told me to trust you
because you're the experts!

254
00:20:32,272 --> 00:20:33,482
Stop it.

255
00:20:35,400 --> 00:20:37,402
Why should I have to sit here
and take this from you?

256
00:20:37,945 --> 00:20:40,739
-What?
-I've done everything I could.

257
00:20:41,573 --> 00:20:44,368
What am I supposed to do
when my bosses are covering it up?

258
00:20:47,371 --> 00:20:49,122
Just be honest with me.

259
00:20:49,206 --> 00:20:51,917
You were doing this for a promotion,
but now that it's off the table,

260
00:20:52,542 --> 00:20:54,086
you're trying to pull out.

261
00:20:54,670 --> 00:20:55,879
Find out the truth.

262
00:20:55,963 --> 00:20:58,173
You get paid with the taxes we pay.

263
00:20:59,841 --> 00:21:03,929
Don't you have a sense of duty
as a civil servant?

264
00:21:06,265 --> 00:21:07,432
My dad...

265
00:21:09,476 --> 00:21:12,312
he died while saving eight people
when he was in the military.

266
00:21:15,274 --> 00:21:16,942
He became a hero.

267
00:21:20,320 --> 00:21:22,489
But it was hard
for the rest of the family.

268
00:21:24,574 --> 00:21:25,701
Civil servant?

269
00:21:26,576 --> 00:21:27,744
Sense of duty?

270
00:21:29,329 --> 00:21:31,581
I don't care about any of that shit.

271
00:21:32,499 --> 00:21:34,626
I'm doing this just to get by.

272
00:21:38,380 --> 00:21:39,881
If I get fired,

273
00:21:40,340 --> 00:21:42,759
my family will become homeless.

274
00:21:45,429 --> 00:21:47,848
You're not the only one who has it rough.

275
00:22:37,356 --> 00:22:40,984
HOONI'S ROOM
PLEASE KNOCK

276
00:23:36,498 --> 00:23:37,499
Keep this brief.

277
00:23:38,333 --> 00:23:39,751
This place is about to close.

278
00:23:39,835 --> 00:23:41,169
Explain to me...

279
00:23:42,712 --> 00:23:44,589
why the flash drive your team took

280
00:23:45,590 --> 00:23:48,468
-is infected with a virus.
-How do you know that?

281
00:23:48,552 --> 00:23:49,428
SHARE
DELETE

282
00:23:49,511 --> 00:23:51,012
I saw it with my own eyes.

283
00:23:53,181 --> 00:23:55,350
Then why do you need an explanation?

284
00:24:49,154 --> 00:24:52,449
...said that this event
could become the starting point.

285
00:24:52,616 --> 00:24:54,075
Now for our next story.

286
00:24:54,242 --> 00:24:57,162
The families of the B357 crash victims
will be visiting the Blue House

287
00:24:57,245 --> 00:24:59,831
to meet President Jeong Gook-pyo
at 11 a.m. today.

288
00:24:59,915 --> 00:25:03,210
The families,
who were invited by the president himself,

289
00:25:03,293 --> 00:25:07,714
will meet to talk about compensation
and future preventative measures.

290
00:25:08,507 --> 00:25:11,885
The Blue House stated that they hope
to console the grieving families,

291
00:25:12,219 --> 00:25:14,137
and looked forward
to opening communication

292
00:25:14,221 --> 00:25:17,516
between the government and the families.

293
00:25:30,070 --> 00:25:32,322
-Hello?
-It's me.

294
00:25:32,531 --> 00:25:33,365
What's up?

295
00:25:34,658 --> 00:25:36,535
I'll explain when we meet up.
Where are you?

296
00:25:40,789 --> 00:25:42,249
No, I'll come to your place.

297
00:25:43,416 --> 00:25:44,376
Hello?

298
00:25:45,377 --> 00:25:46,503
What is she saying?

299
00:25:48,129 --> 00:25:49,839
God, my head...

300
00:26:01,184 --> 00:26:02,102
That was quick.

301
00:26:02,561 --> 00:26:03,645
One sec.

302
00:26:09,484 --> 00:26:11,903
-Who is it?
-I just moved in next door.

303
00:26:11,987 --> 00:26:13,280
I brought you some rice cakes.

304
00:26:14,155 --> 00:26:15,031
I see.

305
00:26:15,949 --> 00:26:18,201
I came over last night,
but you weren't here.

306
00:26:19,202 --> 00:26:20,370
I'll leave them here.

307
00:26:20,745 --> 00:26:21,871
Just a second, please.

308
00:26:25,458 --> 00:26:26,793
Thanks for the food.

309
00:26:32,632 --> 00:26:33,508
Who sent you?

310
00:26:35,760 --> 00:26:38,054
Was it John & Mark?

311
00:26:51,318 --> 00:26:53,236
We have an emergency patient.

312
00:27:14,591 --> 00:27:16,593
Excuse us. Please make way.

313
00:27:42,952 --> 00:27:43,870
Dal-geon?

314
00:28:01,763 --> 00:28:02,764
Shit.

315
00:28:05,517 --> 00:28:08,812
This is the Central Police.
How can I help you?

316
00:28:08,895 --> 00:28:10,438
There's been a kidnapping.

317
00:28:16,945 --> 00:28:20,615
He's in critical condition and suffering
from chest discomfort and dyspnea.

318
00:28:21,116 --> 00:28:22,826
We'll be arriving in 20 minutes.

319
00:28:25,161 --> 00:28:27,580
Hurry up. He'll be conscious soon.

320
00:28:27,997 --> 00:28:29,165
Hang on.

321
00:28:32,544 --> 00:28:33,962
Let's see...

322
00:28:38,842 --> 00:28:40,385
Don't you know how to drive?

323
00:29:19,924 --> 00:29:21,009
Damn it.

324
00:29:29,058 --> 00:29:29,893
Shit.

325
00:30:31,496 --> 00:30:33,206
Get up if you're not dead.

326
00:30:49,639 --> 00:30:50,849
Are you out of your mind?

327
00:30:50,932 --> 00:30:53,643
We don't get paid if he's dead, you idiot.

328
00:30:55,937 --> 00:30:57,856
-Get in!
-Get the syringe.

329
00:31:27,218 --> 00:31:28,177
Over here!

330
00:31:29,095 --> 00:31:30,847
Are you okay?

331
00:31:30,930 --> 00:31:32,098
Are you okay, sir?

332
00:31:32,849 --> 00:31:35,602
Try to stay still.
An ambulance will be here any minute.

333
00:31:36,436 --> 00:31:37,770
Are you hurt?

334
00:31:41,316 --> 00:31:42,317
I'm fine.

335
00:31:42,817 --> 00:31:43,943
Then get in.

336
00:31:45,028 --> 00:31:46,696
There's no time, get in!

337
00:31:49,240 --> 00:31:51,618
You can't just leave.
This was reported as a kidnapping.

338
00:31:51,910 --> 00:31:53,703
Hey, sir!

339
00:32:00,126 --> 00:32:01,127
Listen to this.

340
00:32:25,610 --> 00:32:28,237
You know about the Blue House meeting
with the families, right?

341
00:32:29,739 --> 00:32:33,576
Reveal the information in that recording
in front of the president.

342
00:32:33,952 --> 00:32:35,328
That piece of shit!

343
00:32:39,415 --> 00:32:40,583
What if you get fired?

344
00:32:46,130 --> 00:32:47,674
What about your family?

345
00:32:48,424 --> 00:32:53,221
I'm the daughter of Colonel Go Gang-cheol,
chief of Division One,

346
00:32:54,138 --> 00:32:55,431
and a Marine Corps hero.

347
00:33:00,603 --> 00:33:02,355
Please don't look at me like that.

348
00:33:02,981 --> 00:33:04,899
I'm pissed off at myself too.

349
00:33:15,201 --> 00:33:16,285
Welcome.

350
00:33:16,869 --> 00:33:17,870
This way, please.

351
00:33:30,508 --> 00:33:32,844
Excuse me, sir.
What is your business here?

352
00:33:33,261 --> 00:33:34,721
I'm one of the family members
of the B357 crash victims.

353
00:33:34,804 --> 00:33:35,930
You're late.

354
00:33:36,431 --> 00:33:37,974
Your name, please?

355
00:33:38,057 --> 00:33:40,143
-Cha Dal-geon.
-Cha...

356
00:33:40,643 --> 00:33:42,353
I'm not on the guest list.

357
00:33:43,688 --> 00:33:45,648
I'm afraid you cannot enter, then.

358
00:33:45,732 --> 00:33:47,650
I'm with the NIS.

359
00:33:47,734 --> 00:33:50,403
We must speak to the president. Let us in.

360
00:33:50,486 --> 00:33:52,321
My apologies, but you must leave.

361
00:33:52,405 --> 00:33:54,949
Don't apologize, just let us in.

362
00:33:55,491 --> 00:33:58,661
How come only certain
grieving family members are allowed in?

363
00:33:58,745 --> 00:33:59,954
Open the gate.

364
00:34:00,038 --> 00:34:02,749
Please don't cause any trouble here, sir.

365
00:34:02,832 --> 00:34:03,958
Trouble?

366
00:34:04,459 --> 00:34:06,544
I'm one of the grieving family members!

367
00:34:06,627 --> 00:34:08,212
I need to see the president!

368
00:34:08,296 --> 00:34:09,839
I want to see him!

369
00:34:09,922 --> 00:34:11,174
-You can't, sir.
-What?

370
00:34:11,257 --> 00:34:13,509
-I understand.
-You're supposed to serve the people.

371
00:34:13,593 --> 00:34:15,595
This is not acceptable! Let me go!

372
00:34:15,678 --> 00:34:17,555
THE BLUE HOUSE TOUR BUS

373
00:34:28,191 --> 00:34:29,192
Do you think you can do it?

374
00:34:29,817 --> 00:34:31,944
There's been nothing in the news,
no matter how hard I try.

375
00:34:32,320 --> 00:34:33,446
I have to do this.

376
00:34:38,868 --> 00:34:41,996
Where are you going?
I told you to stay with mommy!

377
00:34:42,330 --> 00:34:43,790
Here we go.

378
00:34:47,877 --> 00:34:50,046
What have you got here? What's this?

379
00:34:51,839 --> 00:34:53,508
Yes, good job.

380
00:34:54,092 --> 00:34:55,134
Yes.

381
00:35:01,140 --> 00:35:03,935
Here are the notes for today's meeting
with the grieving families.

382
00:35:04,018 --> 00:35:05,520
Are these necessary?

383
00:35:06,145 --> 00:35:08,147
There are some people who are upset.

384
00:35:08,231 --> 00:35:09,440
In case the situation turns sour--

385
00:35:09,524 --> 00:35:11,943
You should have filtered out
people like that in advance.

386
00:35:12,902 --> 00:35:16,114
The victims aren't national heroes.

387
00:35:16,197 --> 00:35:19,992
Will people blame the government
if there's a flu outbreak too?

388
00:35:21,160 --> 00:35:23,412
Isn't this tie a bit too flashy?

389
00:35:23,996 --> 00:35:26,874
I'd prefer a plain one.

390
00:35:28,668 --> 00:35:30,586
Come on, Sang-min, smile.

391
00:35:31,379 --> 00:35:33,381
Here we go. One, two...

392
00:35:34,632 --> 00:35:36,342
-Thank you.
-It looks nice.

393
00:35:37,468 --> 00:35:38,594
Study hard.

394
00:35:44,100 --> 00:35:46,519
Excuse me, where's the restroom?

395
00:35:46,602 --> 00:35:48,771
Did you not go
back at the Exhibition Hall?

396
00:35:48,855 --> 00:35:52,692
I did, but... my stomach really hurts.

397
00:35:52,775 --> 00:35:53,985
Follow me, please.

398
00:36:03,452 --> 00:36:04,829
GUIDE MAP

399
00:36:04,912 --> 00:36:08,374
CURRENT LOCATION
BLUE HOUSE MAIN OFFICE

400
00:36:08,457 --> 00:36:09,834
The president of the Republic of Korea.

401
00:37:11,520 --> 00:37:13,231
One of the visitors has gone missing.

402
00:37:32,500 --> 00:37:35,336
This is the control room.
There's an intruder behind the annex.

403
00:37:42,468 --> 00:37:43,386
Damn.

404
00:37:47,515 --> 00:37:48,641
Follow him.

405
00:38:03,823 --> 00:38:04,865
Stop!

406
00:38:05,616 --> 00:38:06,617
Stop, sir!

407
00:38:10,663 --> 00:38:11,497
Shit.

408
00:38:16,252 --> 00:38:18,546
I'm one of the grieving family members
of Flight B357.

409
00:38:18,629 --> 00:38:19,880
I'm here to see the president.

410
00:38:20,339 --> 00:38:22,216
-Arrest him.
-Stop.

411
00:38:22,300 --> 00:38:23,884
I told you, I'm one of the grieving
family members!

412
00:38:39,483 --> 00:38:40,318
Let go.

413
00:38:41,694 --> 00:38:44,113
Let go of me, you bastards!

414
00:38:45,406 --> 00:38:47,033
I need to see the president.

415
00:38:47,283 --> 00:38:49,160
Tell him I'm here!

416
00:38:49,577 --> 00:38:51,329
Let go of me!

417
00:38:51,412 --> 00:38:52,580
What's going on?

418
00:38:52,663 --> 00:38:53,581
Let go!

419
00:38:55,708 --> 00:38:57,543
-He's an intruder.
-I'm one of the grieving family members.

420
00:38:58,836 --> 00:39:00,379
I came to meet the president.

421
00:39:01,213 --> 00:39:02,381
Remove him.

422
00:39:02,465 --> 00:39:04,467
-Let go!
-Let him in.

423
00:39:05,384 --> 00:39:06,385
We can't do that, sir.

424
00:39:06,552 --> 00:39:08,596
I'll take responsibility for him.
Let him in.

425
00:39:08,679 --> 00:39:10,306
This is a serious violation.

426
00:39:10,389 --> 00:39:13,517
Is anyone else here more serious
than that gentleman?

427
00:39:15,728 --> 00:39:17,355
That's for us to decide.

428
00:39:17,730 --> 00:39:20,775
-Even if you insist--
-How dare you disrespect the citizens!

429
00:39:23,319 --> 00:39:25,946
This is exactly why they accuse us
of being authoritarian.

430
00:39:28,366 --> 00:39:30,785
-Please bring this gentleman in.
-Yes, sir.

431
00:39:34,372 --> 00:39:35,581
Follow me, sir.

432
00:39:47,385 --> 00:39:49,470
Chief, we have a problem.

433
00:39:50,763 --> 00:39:53,933
As someone who is responsible
for the safety of all citizens,

434
00:39:54,392 --> 00:39:58,312
I sincerely apologize to you once again.

435
00:39:59,230 --> 00:40:02,525
Although the ICAO
is still investigating the accident,

436
00:40:03,609 --> 00:40:07,738
I will make sure that our government
also does everything in its power

437
00:40:08,531 --> 00:40:12,284
by launching an investigation
and passing any special laws as needed.

438
00:40:13,077 --> 00:40:14,537
Sorry to interrupt you, sir.

439
00:40:15,496 --> 00:40:17,123
A bereaved family member...

440
00:40:21,293 --> 00:40:25,381
There seems to be another guest
waiting outside this room.

441
00:40:27,842 --> 00:40:28,801
Bring him in.

442
00:40:29,635 --> 00:40:31,804
-Mr. President--
-It's okay. Let him in.

443
00:40:44,650 --> 00:40:46,360
Don't be disrespectful.

444
00:41:04,628 --> 00:41:05,880
Good to meet you.

445
00:41:06,630 --> 00:41:08,090
We welcome your visit.

446
00:41:09,300 --> 00:41:10,217
Thank you, sir.

447
00:41:12,136 --> 00:41:13,554
Did the guards do this to you?

448
00:41:14,263 --> 00:41:15,264
No, sir.

449
00:41:16,348 --> 00:41:18,893
Take a seat. Please get him a seat.

450
00:41:21,479 --> 00:41:22,730
The plane...

451
00:41:24,106 --> 00:41:26,609
There weren't any mechanical issues.
It was a terrorist attack.

452
00:41:36,869 --> 00:41:38,454
What do you mean by that?

453
00:41:39,914 --> 00:41:43,125
The co-pilot of the aircraft
conspired with a terrorist...

454
00:41:44,793 --> 00:41:46,045
to crash the plane.

455
00:41:49,924 --> 00:41:52,009
We have reporters in this room.

456
00:41:52,092 --> 00:41:53,511
Even though you're grieving,

457
00:41:53,594 --> 00:41:57,139
you'll have to take full responsibility
for any false statements you make.

458
00:41:58,098 --> 00:41:59,683
I'm not making a false statement.

459
00:42:00,768 --> 00:42:04,230
A video showing the terrorist's face
disappeared from the NIS!

460
00:42:11,320 --> 00:42:12,863
Is this true, Director An?

461
00:42:14,240 --> 00:42:15,449
Well, that's...

462
00:42:15,658 --> 00:42:19,286
I have a recording of a conversation
between two NIS agents.

463
00:42:21,664 --> 00:42:24,333
Keep this brief.
This place is about to close.

464
00:42:24,416 --> 00:42:25,751
Explain to me...

465
00:42:25,834 --> 00:42:29,838
why the flash drive your team took
is infected with a virus.

466
00:42:30,673 --> 00:42:32,049
How do you know that?

467
00:42:32,383 --> 00:42:34,385
I saw it with my own eyes.

468
00:42:34,927 --> 00:42:36,637
Then why do you need an explanation?

469
00:42:38,097 --> 00:42:39,682
Are you going to cover this up?

470
00:42:40,891 --> 00:42:43,394
The plane crash killed 211 people.

471
00:42:43,477 --> 00:42:44,645
Those were the director's orders.

472
00:42:56,448 --> 00:42:57,992
Come this way, sir.

473
00:43:12,965 --> 00:43:13,966
Dal-geon!

474
00:43:15,384 --> 00:43:17,928
Ms. O... where's your husband?

475
00:43:19,972 --> 00:43:21,724
Where is Kim Woo-gi, the co-pilot?

476
00:43:23,058 --> 00:43:24,977
Why are you doing this to me?

477
00:43:25,060 --> 00:43:27,271
You took out a five-billion-won
life insurance policy in his name,

478
00:43:27,354 --> 00:43:28,606
and you're the beneficiary!

479
00:43:41,827 --> 00:43:42,661
My...

480
00:43:44,455 --> 00:43:46,832
My husband's death is killing me!

481
00:43:49,001 --> 00:43:49,877
I...

482
00:43:56,467 --> 00:43:57,760
Say something, Sang-mi!

483
00:43:57,843 --> 00:43:59,845
Don't act like you're about to pass out!
Talk to us!

484
00:44:08,103 --> 00:44:10,064
Mr. Gi!

485
00:44:12,775 --> 00:44:14,985
I don't have to meet Assemblyman Lee.

486
00:44:16,028 --> 00:44:19,782
Go Hae-ri just loaded her gun
and pulled the trigger!

487
00:44:21,241 --> 00:44:22,493
That kid!

488
00:44:23,786 --> 00:44:24,703
Breaking news.

489
00:44:24,787 --> 00:44:27,665
A claim has been made that
a terrorist attack caused Flight B357

490
00:44:27,748 --> 00:44:30,542
to crash near the Moroccan coast.

491
00:44:30,626 --> 00:44:32,836
Mr. Cha claimed

492
00:44:32,961 --> 00:44:36,256
that the B357 crash was intentional,
and the attack was led...

493
00:44:36,340 --> 00:44:37,383
Call Shadow.

494
00:44:37,466 --> 00:44:39,009
...by John & Mark,
a global defense company.

495
00:44:39,093 --> 00:44:41,512
-I'm sure he's busy right now.
-Just call him!

496
00:44:41,595 --> 00:44:43,555
The victims' families
held an emergency press conference

497
00:44:43,639 --> 00:44:47,601
to call for a special investigation
to terminate the director of the NIS

498
00:44:47,685 --> 00:44:49,937
and to uncover the truth
behind Flight B357's crash.

499
00:44:50,020 --> 00:44:52,606
The opposition party released a statement
regarding the crash,

500
00:44:52,731 --> 00:44:55,818
and severely criticized the ruling party.

501
00:45:01,156 --> 00:45:03,200
They stated that
the government's incompetence...

502
00:45:03,534 --> 00:45:06,412
Choosing Cha Dal-geon
was a great decision, sir.

503
00:45:07,579 --> 00:45:09,790
...they are busy
protecting the president's reputation.

504
00:45:09,915 --> 00:45:13,836
Lobbyists don't use weapons
to conduct business.

505
00:45:13,919 --> 00:45:16,296
...irresponsible when it came
to protecting its citizens...

506
00:45:16,380 --> 00:45:18,048
They use people.

507
00:45:18,882 --> 00:45:22,136
Pointed out as the organizers
behind the terrorist attack,

508
00:45:22,219 --> 00:45:23,512
John & Mark stated that

509
00:45:23,595 --> 00:45:26,849
they would be conducting
a thorough investigation.

510
00:45:26,932 --> 00:45:29,101
The NIS also stated that
they would be investigating

511
00:45:29,184 --> 00:45:30,853
the people involved in the case,

512
00:45:30,936 --> 00:45:35,941
and would be looking into the whereabouts
of co-pilot Kim Woo-gi.

513
00:45:56,378 --> 00:45:58,547
CO-PILOT MIGHT BE ALIVE

514
00:46:08,182 --> 00:46:09,600
Why did I do that?

515
00:46:11,268 --> 00:46:12,436
RESIGNATION LETTER

516
00:46:14,062 --> 00:46:15,689
You're insane, Go Hae-ri.

517
00:46:18,692 --> 00:46:21,570
You're out of your mind. You're crazy.

518
00:46:36,084 --> 00:46:37,294
I need to talk to you.

519
00:46:37,753 --> 00:46:38,670
I...

520
00:46:41,048 --> 00:46:42,341
I'm really busy right now.

521
00:46:42,674 --> 00:46:44,259
That resignation letter--

522
00:46:44,343 --> 00:46:47,679
As an NIS agent,
I don't regret my actions.

523
00:46:49,973 --> 00:46:52,267
After I resign
and return to being a civilian,

524
00:46:53,018 --> 00:46:57,439
I'll give you an official
and personal apology.

525
00:47:00,984 --> 00:47:02,069
Go Hae-ri.

526
00:47:05,614 --> 00:47:06,698
Come with me.

527
00:47:26,969 --> 00:47:30,013
I'll take full responsibility,
and I'll resign.

528
00:47:30,389 --> 00:47:31,390
What?

529
00:47:32,474 --> 00:47:33,809
Take responsibility?

530
00:47:34,518 --> 00:47:36,854
Are you a chief or a deputy?

531
00:47:36,937 --> 00:47:38,522
Who are you to be taking responsibility?

532
00:47:40,774 --> 00:47:41,692
This is my letter of resignation.

533
00:47:43,777 --> 00:47:45,404
Did you think that a letter

534
00:47:45,487 --> 00:47:48,198
would help you quit in peace
and go home just like that?

535
00:47:49,449 --> 00:47:51,285
You deserve to go to prison

536
00:47:51,702 --> 00:47:53,495
for leaking confidential information.

537
00:47:54,246 --> 00:47:55,080
Excuse me?

538
00:47:55,539 --> 00:47:56,415
P...?

539
00:47:56,874 --> 00:47:58,584
-Prison?
-You...

540
00:47:59,835 --> 00:48:01,837
You never met Cha Dal-geon.

541
00:48:03,589 --> 00:48:06,008
-What?
-Just play stupid.

542
00:48:06,091 --> 00:48:08,051
You never gave him the recording.

543
00:48:09,344 --> 00:48:10,804
But Cha Dal-geon--

544
00:48:10,888 --> 00:48:13,098
He wouldn't want you
getting fired either.

545
00:48:13,932 --> 00:48:16,852
I'll try to take all the heat,
so you can just...

546
00:48:18,270 --> 00:48:19,688
Just stand there
and shamelessly stick to the lie!

547
00:48:21,106 --> 00:48:23,150
I can definitely be shameless...

548
00:48:24,234 --> 00:48:27,237
But if I do that,
Mr. Gi will take all the blame.

549
00:48:27,321 --> 00:48:29,156
You're worried about Gi?

550
00:48:30,532 --> 00:48:31,783
What about me?

551
00:48:32,159 --> 00:48:33,452
If you admit your mistake,

552
00:48:33,535 --> 00:48:37,581
I'll have to resign,
all because of a nitwit like you!

553
00:48:38,081 --> 00:48:39,791
You think I'm doing this
because I'm worried about you?

554
00:48:41,126 --> 00:48:44,171
You really don't get it, do you?

555
00:48:45,464 --> 00:48:47,507
Dear God...

556
00:48:56,391 --> 00:48:57,225
Damn it.

557
00:49:06,777 --> 00:49:07,694
Don't mind us.

558
00:49:07,778 --> 00:49:10,072
-You're supposed to drink it.
-Yes, sir.

559
00:49:19,081 --> 00:49:21,375
I heard that you almost got kidnapped
on your way here.

560
00:49:22,000 --> 00:49:23,085
Yes...

561
00:49:23,377 --> 00:49:25,587
They've been trying to kill me
since I was in Morocco.

562
00:49:25,671 --> 00:49:27,881
Who are you referring to?

563
00:49:28,090 --> 00:49:29,383
John & Mark.

564
00:49:29,883 --> 00:49:33,553
The co-pilot was working for John & Mark
up until last year,

565
00:49:33,637 --> 00:49:36,473
and his wife used to work for them
as a flight attendant.

566
00:49:37,099 --> 00:49:40,394
And the people who profited the most
from this incident--

567
00:49:40,477 --> 00:49:44,398
I'm very impressed, Mr. Cha.

568
00:49:46,108 --> 00:49:48,610
Despite the kidnapping
and murder attempts,

569
00:49:48,694 --> 00:49:51,196
you had the courage to expose the truth.

570
00:49:55,909 --> 00:50:00,539
Please be patient
while I find out exactly what happened.

571
00:50:02,082 --> 00:50:03,166
Thank you, Mr. President.

572
00:50:07,087 --> 00:50:09,756
Could I ask you for a favor?

573
00:50:10,132 --> 00:50:11,008
Yes, go ahead.

574
00:50:12,426 --> 00:50:16,138
Please don't let the NIS agents
on the recording get fired.

575
00:50:17,305 --> 00:50:20,684
Well, that's not up to me to decide.

576
00:50:20,767 --> 00:50:23,729
If it hadn't been for them,
we wouldn't have all this information.

577
00:50:24,604 --> 00:50:25,897
Please, Mr. President.

578
00:50:28,400 --> 00:50:29,985
That's not a bad idea.

579
00:50:30,152 --> 00:50:33,155
All eyes are on the NIS right now.

580
00:50:33,238 --> 00:50:36,033
It wouldn't be a good idea
to fire those agents.

581
00:50:39,661 --> 00:50:40,746
I give you my word.

582
00:50:45,250 --> 00:50:48,628
Let's hope we have smiles on our faces
the next time we meet.

583
00:50:48,879 --> 00:50:51,548
Thank you, sir. Thank you very much.

584
00:50:52,132 --> 00:50:53,258
Thank you.

585
00:51:00,432 --> 00:51:01,308
Yes?

586
00:51:02,434 --> 00:51:04,478
We have orders to escort Mr. Cha
to a safe house.

587
00:51:05,437 --> 00:51:06,605
Who gave those orders?

588
00:51:07,397 --> 00:51:09,691
I asked the chief officer of the
Presidential Security Service to do it.

589
00:51:09,775 --> 00:51:11,777
He'll be in danger now that
his identity has been revealed.

590
00:51:12,319 --> 00:51:13,820
That's fine. You don't have to--

591
00:51:13,904 --> 00:51:15,614
No, let's do what Yun says.

592
00:51:15,822 --> 00:51:18,116
You're a very important person now.

593
00:51:20,452 --> 00:51:22,037
Is the house guarded
by the Security Service?

594
00:51:22,287 --> 00:51:23,413
No, the NIS.

595
00:51:24,748 --> 00:51:26,416
I'll take him to the safe house.

596
00:51:31,505 --> 00:51:33,173
-Thank you, sir.
-Take care.

597
00:51:45,811 --> 00:51:47,020
My deepest apologies, sir.

598
00:51:48,897 --> 00:51:50,857
I'll see to it that this gets fixed--

599
00:51:55,946 --> 00:51:59,074
You already spilled the soup
and scalded my balls.

600
00:51:59,241 --> 00:52:00,158
Fix what?

601
00:52:00,909 --> 00:52:02,911
Please give me a chance.
I can fix this, sir.

602
00:52:03,120 --> 00:52:04,037
Resign.

603
00:52:06,915 --> 00:52:07,916
I made a mistake.

604
00:52:08,875 --> 00:52:09,835
Please forgive me.

605
00:52:10,085 --> 00:52:12,921
I took someone who used to monitor
the Han River's water quality

606
00:52:13,004 --> 00:52:15,215
and made you director of the NIS.

607
00:52:15,507 --> 00:52:17,884
The least you could do is earn your keep.

608
00:52:26,685 --> 00:52:28,228
Get up, Director An.

609
00:52:31,731 --> 00:52:32,858
Tell me, Prime Minister...

610
00:52:34,484 --> 00:52:36,319
how should we take care of this crisis?

611
00:52:37,195 --> 00:52:39,322
I mean, is there any other way?

612
00:52:39,823 --> 00:52:42,450
We have to fix the root of the problem.

613
00:52:44,744 --> 00:52:46,621
Who do you think should fix it?

614
00:52:47,122 --> 00:52:48,957
The police? The prosecutors?

615
00:52:49,040 --> 00:52:50,792
They'll just cause more problems.

616
00:52:50,876 --> 00:52:53,211
I think our best option
is to let Director An deal with it.

617
00:52:56,047 --> 00:52:59,009
If you give me one more chance,
I'll do everything in my power

618
00:52:59,092 --> 00:53:00,594
to take care of this.

619
00:53:01,887 --> 00:53:04,014
Don't fire the agents on the recording.

620
00:53:04,097 --> 00:53:05,891
It will only garner attention.

621
00:53:06,391 --> 00:53:07,642
Yes, sir.

622
00:53:18,320 --> 00:53:19,654
What a pity...

623
00:53:19,738 --> 00:53:21,948
to be losing John & Mark like this.

624
00:53:23,116 --> 00:53:25,368
Are you serious?

625
00:53:26,870 --> 00:53:29,206
What can I do? Look at the mess we're in.

626
00:53:29,289 --> 00:53:31,875
You may have entrusted this matter to An,

627
00:53:31,958 --> 00:53:34,836
but that doesn't mean you can't
take action from time to time.

628
00:53:36,046 --> 00:53:39,549
The truth?
We can release our version of it.

629
00:53:46,556 --> 00:53:49,476
What the hell are you saying?
Why should I take responsibility?

630
00:53:49,559 --> 00:53:52,729
If a child plays with fire,
the parents should take the blame.

631
00:53:53,438 --> 00:53:55,815
Don't you see how much shame
Go Hae-ri has brought to our organization?

632
00:53:58,026 --> 00:54:02,030
Go Hae-ri, are you the one
who leaked the recording?

633
00:54:04,991 --> 00:54:08,578
I thought you didn't know it existed,
and that you've never met Cha Dal-geon.

634
00:54:13,083 --> 00:54:16,878
Answer me, Go. I know you're not the one
who gave him the recording.

635
00:54:18,922 --> 00:54:20,090
-I apolo--
-It was me.

636
00:54:24,427 --> 00:54:25,845
I recorded our conversation...

637
00:54:26,680 --> 00:54:27,973
and gave the recording to Cha Dal-geon.

638
00:54:28,556 --> 00:54:31,017
What are you saying, Mr. Gi?

639
00:54:32,978 --> 00:54:33,937
That's not true.

640
00:54:34,020 --> 00:54:36,189
Mr. Gi doesn't even know Cha Dal-geon.
It was me.

641
00:54:36,481 --> 00:54:39,651
Are the two of you playing games with me?

642
00:54:43,154 --> 00:54:45,115
Aren't you ashamed of yourselves?

643
00:54:47,075 --> 00:54:51,329
More than 200 civilians were killed,
and yet we're so eager to cover this up.

644
00:54:51,621 --> 00:54:53,957
And now you're blaming these two?

645
00:54:54,624 --> 00:54:56,960
This is why people
criticize us all the time,

646
00:54:57,043 --> 00:54:58,712
saying that we're incompetent
and irresponsible.

647
00:54:58,795 --> 00:54:59,921
Hey, Gang...

648
00:55:00,714 --> 00:55:02,590
we're not here
to listen to your complaints.

649
00:55:03,550 --> 00:55:05,176
Let's be real for a second.

650
00:55:06,428 --> 00:55:09,306
Who here actually believes
that the video was infected by a virus?

651
00:55:11,224 --> 00:55:14,894
We all know someone deleted it,
yet we're turning a blind eye.

652
00:55:16,313 --> 00:55:17,897
It's good that you brought that up.

653
00:55:18,273 --> 00:55:19,190
Gi Tae-ung...

654
00:55:20,608 --> 00:55:22,902
did you find any evidence that
an external hacker got into our systems?

655
00:55:23,320 --> 00:55:24,154
No, sir.

656
00:55:24,571 --> 00:55:27,615
That means someone inside the NIS
planted the virus.

657
00:55:27,699 --> 00:55:31,745
All of the security footage from that day
has been deleted too.

658
00:55:31,828 --> 00:55:34,331
Only someone
at the director level or higher

659
00:55:34,789 --> 00:55:36,499
has access to the control room.

660
00:55:36,750 --> 00:55:38,793
Was it you, Min?

661
00:55:40,545 --> 00:55:41,546
Are you nuts?

662
00:55:42,297 --> 00:55:44,883
I'm the one shouldering most
of the backlash from this incident.

663
00:55:45,050 --> 00:55:46,217
Fucking hell.

664
00:55:48,053 --> 00:55:49,679
I thought it was you.

665
00:55:50,347 --> 00:55:53,308
-What?
-You hate seeing me being successful.

666
00:55:53,391 --> 00:55:55,226
Did you do this to screw me over?

667
00:55:55,310 --> 00:55:56,770
You bastard!

668
00:55:56,853 --> 00:55:58,063
Excuse me.

669
00:56:00,023 --> 00:56:02,484
The director wants to talk to all of us.

670
00:56:33,139 --> 00:56:34,182
Our president...

671
00:56:35,308 --> 00:56:36,893
has given us one more chance.

672
00:56:37,685 --> 00:56:39,396
I hope that all of you will do your best,

673
00:56:40,230 --> 00:56:41,731
not just with the B357 incident,

674
00:56:42,273 --> 00:56:44,234
but also with our national security

675
00:56:45,068 --> 00:56:47,445
and our national interest as well.

676
00:56:48,113 --> 00:56:51,282
-Understood?
-Yes, sir!

677
00:56:52,075 --> 00:56:55,578
Firstly, we always act
in the best interest

678
00:56:55,662 --> 00:56:58,164
of our government and the truth.

679
00:56:58,248 --> 00:57:01,960
Firstly, we always predict
and make the necessary preparations

680
00:57:02,043 --> 00:57:05,296
to guarantee our national security.

681
00:57:05,380 --> 00:57:08,591
Firstly, dishonoring ourselves

682
00:57:08,675 --> 00:57:11,594
is the same as dishonoring
the organization.

683
00:57:15,849 --> 00:57:18,435
Do you think we should make him
take a drug test?

684
00:57:18,518 --> 00:57:22,730
How could he not fire you
for leaking confidential information?

685
00:57:22,814 --> 00:57:24,607
I may be unlucky
when it comes to most things,

686
00:57:24,691 --> 00:57:27,026
but I have amazing luck
when it comes to my job.

687
00:57:27,110 --> 00:57:32,991
But who is the dirty traitor
who got rid of the video?

688
00:57:33,616 --> 00:57:34,742
I don't know.

689
00:57:35,118 --> 00:57:37,287
After what I saw in the meeting,
I'm pretty sure it wasn't Chief Min.

690
00:57:37,370 --> 00:57:39,539
And it probably wasn't Chief Gang either.

691
00:57:39,622 --> 00:57:41,791
What about Chief Park
from the Inspection Team?

692
00:57:41,875 --> 00:57:43,209
-Or Chief Choi--?
-That's right--

693
00:57:46,671 --> 00:57:47,714
Hello, sir.

694
00:57:52,051 --> 00:57:54,179
Hey, Hwa-suk!

695
00:57:58,725 --> 00:58:01,478
I would like to formally apologize.

696
00:58:01,728 --> 00:58:05,565
I had no intention of throwing you
under the bus for the leaked recording.

697
00:58:06,399 --> 00:58:08,985
Things got out of control
so quickly, and--

698
00:58:10,737 --> 00:58:11,905
I mean it.

699
00:58:12,322 --> 00:58:14,491
I didn't mean to cause you any trouble--

700
00:58:14,574 --> 00:58:15,617
Well done.

701
00:58:32,050 --> 00:58:34,844
Close your mouth, girl,
before flies get in!

702
00:58:35,929 --> 00:58:39,349
He just praised me.

703
00:58:40,350 --> 00:58:42,227
I just heard from Se-hun

704
00:58:42,352 --> 00:58:44,729
that you weren't the only one
who had the recording.

705
00:58:44,812 --> 00:58:48,191
Mr. Gi didn't tell you, but... Come here.

706
00:59:08,211 --> 00:59:09,963
Why is he so late?

707
00:59:10,922 --> 00:59:13,800
Did Shadow really say he'd be coming?

708
00:59:13,883 --> 00:59:16,302
What, you think I imagined it?

709
00:59:19,722 --> 00:59:21,641
It's just that he's not
an easy person to meet.

710
00:59:25,478 --> 00:59:26,980
Damn it.

711
00:59:29,232 --> 00:59:34,404
How dare he mess up the face of an angel?

712
00:59:38,199 --> 00:59:41,953
How should I crush that bastard
Cha Dal-geon?

713
00:59:49,002 --> 00:59:50,420
Yes, Mr. Hong.

714
00:59:52,630 --> 00:59:56,050
What do you think?
I'm getting ready for my revenge match.

715
00:59:56,134 --> 00:59:57,719
You can stop now.

716
00:59:59,387 --> 01:00:01,097
What are you talking about?

717
01:00:01,931 --> 01:00:03,558
Don't you want Cha Dal-geon dead?

718
01:00:03,641 --> 01:00:05,226
Another team will take over.

719
01:00:08,313 --> 01:00:09,606
Is this because...

720
01:00:10,898 --> 01:00:12,900
you don't trust me?

721
01:00:33,004 --> 01:00:35,882
Cha Dal-geon is headed
to an NIS safe house.

722
01:00:36,215 --> 01:00:38,176
What does that have to do with anything?

723
01:00:38,843 --> 01:00:41,012
It's not an easy place to break into.
It'll be dangerous.

724
01:00:43,723 --> 01:00:45,850
So it's dangerous for me,
but not for the other guy?

725
01:00:52,607 --> 01:00:53,900
Who is it?

726
01:00:54,317 --> 01:00:56,569
Who's the asshole
that stole my client from me?

727
01:00:57,945 --> 01:01:01,449
Someone deadly and very brutal.

728
01:01:05,411 --> 01:01:06,454
Send him in.

729
01:01:08,748 --> 01:01:11,334
Shadow is finally here.

730
01:01:27,809 --> 01:01:28,851
You...

731
01:01:32,814 --> 01:01:33,731
Want one?

732
01:01:36,317 --> 01:01:37,318
Thanks.

733
01:01:46,452 --> 01:01:48,830
Go get the empty plates...

734
01:01:49,664 --> 01:01:51,499
along with Cha Dal-geon's head.

735
01:01:59,298 --> 01:02:00,216
