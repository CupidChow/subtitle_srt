1
00:00:09,507 --> 00:00:11,576
Oh, my. What a beautiful park.

2
00:00:11,577 --> 00:00:14,006
- Look at this place.
- It's early in the morning.

3
00:00:14,007 --> 00:00:15,046
(It's a colorful gap between summer and winter.)

4
00:00:15,047 --> 00:00:16,707
Look at the elders here.

5
00:00:17,377 --> 00:00:19,576
They are working out to stay healthy early in the morning.

6
00:00:19,577 --> 00:00:20,717
(Impressed)

7
00:00:20,747 --> 00:00:22,386
- Hello.
- Hello.

8
00:00:22,387 --> 00:00:23,886
- It's been a while.
- It's been a while.

9
00:00:23,887 --> 00:00:25,217
Has it been three months?

10
00:00:25,287 --> 00:00:27,356
- It feels like it hasn't been...
- It feels like only yesterday.

11
00:00:27,357 --> 00:00:28,887
- that long.
- Right?

12
00:00:29,527 --> 00:00:31,397
(The first season began in April last year.)

13
00:00:31,427 --> 00:00:33,356
- We're back. My gosh.
- It's nice to be back.

14
00:00:33,357 --> 00:00:36,797
(Afterward, there had been two more seasons.)

15
00:00:36,867 --> 00:00:40,137
Our show has returned only after three months.

16
00:00:40,237 --> 00:00:41,607
The viewers might think,

17
00:00:41,737 --> 00:00:43,907
"Well, they seem to return quite often now."

18
00:00:44,377 --> 00:00:46,807
They might not be over the moon to see us.

19
00:00:47,107 --> 00:00:49,176
Instead, they're chill about it. "Oh, a new season is starting."

20
00:00:49,177 --> 00:00:51,116
- "They return whenever possible."
- Yes, that's the reaction.

21
00:00:51,117 --> 00:00:53,476
- That must be their reaction now.
- Yes. That must be it.

22
00:00:53,477 --> 00:00:55,616
We don't have to emphasize how long it's been.

23
00:00:55,617 --> 00:00:58,216
- Gosh, there's no need for that.
- Right.

24
00:00:58,217 --> 00:00:59,857
We are filming in October, though.

25
00:01:00,387 --> 00:01:02,156
It will be cold by the time this airs then.

26
00:01:02,157 --> 00:01:03,956
Right. By the time this airs,

27
00:01:03,957 --> 00:01:05,797
- it'll be cold and windy.
- Yes.

28
00:01:05,897 --> 00:01:08,126
But it's not that cold right now.

29
00:01:08,127 --> 00:01:09,696
We can't pretend to be shaking in cold...

30
00:01:09,697 --> 00:01:11,896
- or comment on how cold it is.
- We can't do that.

31
00:01:11,897 --> 00:01:13,696
- We can't see our breath now.
- Right.

32
00:01:13,697 --> 00:01:15,206
The viewers will see that it's not cold now.

33
00:01:15,207 --> 00:01:17,006
- It's not winter yet.
- It's not winter.

34
00:01:17,007 --> 00:01:18,076
- Right.
- Yes.

35
00:01:18,077 --> 00:01:20,777
So we're filming in late October and then in late November again?

36
00:01:21,107 --> 00:01:22,276
- Yes.
- It's because of you.

37
00:01:22,277 --> 00:01:23,446
Why is that because of me?

38
00:01:23,447 --> 00:01:25,446
You can't film in November because you're filming a drama.

39
00:01:25,447 --> 00:01:28,087
Well, I have to go to South America.

40
00:01:28,847 --> 00:01:29,887
Why?

41
00:01:30,217 --> 00:01:31,617
- After "When the Phone Rings,"
- Yes.

42
00:01:31,817 --> 00:01:33,286
I got a lot of fans...

43
00:01:33,287 --> 00:01:34,956
- in South America.
- I see.

44
00:01:34,957 --> 00:01:36,627
- You're going there for a fan-meet?
- Yes.

45
00:01:37,127 --> 00:01:38,656
- Really?
- Back then...

46
00:01:38,657 --> 00:01:40,126
- when the last episode aired, - Okay.

47
00:01:40,127 --> 00:01:42,666
people watched it at a food court.

48
00:01:42,667 --> 00:01:45,096
- About 700 to 800 people gathered.
- Really?

49
00:01:45,097 --> 00:01:46,536
Remember the 2002 Soccer Game?

50
00:01:46,537 --> 00:01:48,066
- We saw it on a big screen.
- Just like that.

51
00:01:48,067 --> 00:01:50,436
- They watched it just like that.
- I see.

52
00:01:50,437 --> 00:01:52,776
I couldn't go there right after the drama ended.

53
00:01:52,777 --> 00:01:54,776
- But I'll go now.
- Okay. You should go.

54
00:01:54,777 --> 00:01:57,817
This is why we can't film in November.

55
00:01:58,277 --> 00:02:00,516
Why are you blaming me for me?

56
00:02:00,517 --> 00:02:01,716
But it's true!

57
00:02:01,717 --> 00:02:03,246
But you're busy too.

58
00:02:03,247 --> 00:02:05,916
I'm busy too. But I have time to film our show.

59
00:02:05,917 --> 00:02:08,056
- Gosh, it's not fair.
- You're going to South America.

60
00:02:08,057 --> 00:02:09,756
- That's why we can't film.
- Wait.

61
00:02:09,757 --> 00:02:11,026
Then why don't you join me?

62
00:02:11,027 --> 00:02:13,456
Why would I do that? No one there is waiting to see me.

63
00:02:13,457 --> 00:02:15,526
- I'm sure there are some people.
- Why would I go there?

64
00:02:15,527 --> 00:02:17,636
- Tell them you'll be there soon.
- They can't be waiting for me.

65
00:02:17,637 --> 00:02:19,036
Say hello in Spanish.

66
00:02:19,037 --> 00:02:20,397
- Hola.
- Hola.

67
00:02:20,837 --> 00:02:23,336
Seriously. When you get there,

68
00:02:23,337 --> 00:02:25,537
- you have to...
- I can hear Jae Suk chatting.

69
00:02:25,937 --> 00:02:27,447
(Whenever Friend 2: Chuckling)

70
00:02:27,577 --> 00:02:29,006
I'm only counting on you.

71
00:02:29,007 --> 00:02:30,177
- Really?
- Yes.

72
00:02:30,307 --> 00:02:32,076
Well, don't worry. Jae Suk...

73
00:02:32,077 --> 00:02:33,987
and Yeon Seok are great with people.

74
00:02:34,217 --> 00:02:35,887
You're going to four different countries.

75
00:02:36,287 --> 00:02:37,756
Isn't it... Wait.

76
00:02:37,757 --> 00:02:39,316
- What? My gosh.
- They're here.

77
00:02:39,317 --> 00:02:40,687
- Hello.
- Hey, Je Hoon.

78
00:02:41,387 --> 00:02:42,856
- Hello.
- Hey, Je Hoon.

79
00:02:42,857 --> 00:02:44,356
It's been a long time, Ye Jin.

80
00:02:44,357 --> 00:02:45,657
- It's been so long.
- Hello.

81
00:02:46,297 --> 00:02:49,367
("Taxi Driver" has made a spectacular return.)

82
00:02:49,997 --> 00:02:53,197
(Lee Je Hoon as Kim Do Gi)

83
00:02:53,397 --> 00:02:56,067
(He's bringing justice while in disguise.)

84
00:02:56,737 --> 00:02:59,176
(She's an actress with a wide range of genres...)

85
00:02:59,177 --> 00:03:01,577
(from "Fight For My Way" and "VIP.")

86
00:03:01,647 --> 00:03:03,276
(Pyo Ye Jin has met her career-defining role,)

87
00:03:03,277 --> 00:03:04,917
(a genius hacker, in "Taxi Driver.")

88
00:03:05,047 --> 00:03:07,017
We're already ready for it.

89
00:03:07,387 --> 00:03:09,046
("'Taxi Driver' Records the Highest Ratings, 15.6 Percent")

90
00:03:09,047 --> 00:03:10,956
("'Taxi Driver' Ranks 1st Place for Popularity for 3 Weeks in a Row")

91
00:03:10,957 --> 00:03:14,157
(Even more sinister villains are dominating the drama.)

92
00:03:14,287 --> 00:03:15,287
Who are you?

93
00:03:15,727 --> 00:03:17,997
(Me? A taxi driver!)

94
00:03:18,427 --> 00:03:19,756
- Hello.
- Have you been well?

95
00:03:19,757 --> 00:03:21,396
- Gosh, Je Hoon.
- Hello.

96
00:03:21,397 --> 00:03:22,797
- Nice to meet you.
- It's early in the morning.

97
00:03:23,167 --> 00:03:24,537
- Hey, Je Hoon.
- Yeon Seok.

98
00:03:25,937 --> 00:03:29,107
- "Yeon Seok."
- We're the same age.

99
00:03:29,337 --> 00:03:30,806
- You guys are the same age?
- Yes.

100
00:03:30,807 --> 00:03:31,837
- We're the same age.
- Yes.

101
00:03:32,377 --> 00:03:34,476
- My gosh, "Taxi Driver."
- Yes.

102
00:03:34,477 --> 00:03:35,506
- The 3rd season is back.
- The 3rd season.

103
00:03:35,507 --> 00:03:37,517
Je Hoon and Ye Jin are joining us.

104
00:03:37,917 --> 00:03:40,016
- Nice to see you.
- Hello.

105
00:03:40,017 --> 00:03:41,747
- Your drama is back at last.
- Yes.

106
00:03:42,117 --> 00:03:44,616
How can a drama go for three seasons?

107
00:03:44,617 --> 00:03:48,227
I guess we're following in the footsteps of "Dr. Romantic."

108
00:03:48,587 --> 00:03:49,957
- We're back with a third season.
- This is amazing.

109
00:03:50,457 --> 00:03:52,526
- Hey, this is impressive.
- We're back again.

110
00:03:52,527 --> 00:03:54,096
- Seriously.
- Having a third season...

111
00:03:54,097 --> 00:03:56,096
at a major TV station at times like this...

112
00:03:56,097 --> 00:03:57,767
- It's not an easy feat.
- isn't easy.

113
00:03:58,267 --> 00:03:59,566
- Isn't it true?
- Yes.

114
00:03:59,567 --> 00:04:00,667
Right.

115
00:04:01,237 --> 00:04:03,766
You're dressed like an office worker today.

116
00:04:03,767 --> 00:04:04,936
- You think so?
- Yes.

117
00:04:04,937 --> 00:04:06,607
But I look too hip for someone dressed for work.

118
00:04:07,207 --> 00:04:08,807
- You do look hip.
- Okay.

119
00:04:09,377 --> 00:04:11,876
- Did that bother you?
- Gosh, no.

120
00:04:11,877 --> 00:04:12,916
I wouldn't know...

121
00:04:12,917 --> 00:04:13,917
- since I never worked in an office.
- Never?

122
00:04:14,017 --> 00:04:16,017
Didn't you have a company job before?

123
00:04:16,117 --> 00:04:19,087
I did, but my job required me to wear a uniform.

124
00:04:19,657 --> 00:04:20,756
- You were a flight attendant.
- Yes.

125
00:04:20,757 --> 00:04:24,227
- She used to be a flight attendant.
- Right.

126
00:04:24,497 --> 00:04:27,767
Anyway, we're meeting up early in the morning.

127
00:04:28,197 --> 00:04:29,767
You must be a bit tired.

128
00:04:30,097 --> 00:04:32,666
- Actually, we're still...
- Yes.

129
00:04:32,667 --> 00:04:34,407
- filming "Taxi Driver 3."
- Right.

130
00:04:34,737 --> 00:04:37,037
We were filming until late night...

131
00:04:37,677 --> 00:04:40,176
- in Sinan, South Jeolla Province.
- You just came back to Seoul?

132
00:04:40,177 --> 00:04:41,706
- Yes. We just came back.
- We came back together.

133
00:04:41,707 --> 00:04:44,246
Gosh, we should've gone down there. I'm sorry about that.

134
00:04:44,247 --> 00:04:45,547
- Why didn't you?
- Right.

135
00:04:46,347 --> 00:04:47,447
Sinan is a beautiful place.

136
00:04:48,287 --> 00:04:49,546
- That's a great place.
- Yes.

137
00:04:49,547 --> 00:04:51,016
- We should've visited them there.
- Yes.

138
00:04:51,017 --> 00:04:53,287
- The filming must be tough.
- They're still filming the drama.

139
00:04:53,457 --> 00:04:55,626
They sound a bit sensitive today.

140
00:04:55,627 --> 00:04:57,727
(The duo from "Taxi Driver" won't let empty formalities slide.)

141
00:04:57,827 --> 00:04:59,656
Wait. Yeon Seok and Je Hoon have never filmed...

142
00:04:59,657 --> 00:05:01,767
- dramas or movies together, right?
- Jae Suk.

143
00:05:01,897 --> 00:05:04,367
- Jung Seok was on our show.
- When?

144
00:05:04,597 --> 00:05:05,867
"Architecture 101."

145
00:05:06,367 --> 00:05:07,867
Right. You were in the movie.

146
00:05:08,437 --> 00:05:13,407
(They discussed "Architecture 101" with Jung Seok.)

147
00:05:14,147 --> 00:05:15,606
(He played that annoying guy.)

148
00:05:15,607 --> 00:05:17,917
(The entire country hated Yeon Seok's character.)

149
00:05:18,517 --> 00:05:20,746
(That day, Jae Suk...)

150
00:05:20,747 --> 00:05:23,917
(criticized Yeon Seok's character, Mr. Gangnam.)

151
00:05:24,787 --> 00:05:26,356
Right, you were in the movie.

152
00:05:26,357 --> 00:05:28,927
- Why point your finger at me?
- You... Right. Je Hoon.

153
00:05:29,027 --> 00:05:30,487
- My gosh. Why?
- This jerk...

154
00:05:30,657 --> 00:05:32,427
- Why point your finger at me?
- He was in the movie.

155
00:05:32,527 --> 00:05:34,566
- He was an upperclassman.
- Right.

156
00:05:34,567 --> 00:05:36,366
Je Hoon, I bet you were so angry in the movie.

157
00:05:36,367 --> 00:05:38,497
- I cried a lot in the movie.
- Yes.

158
00:05:39,497 --> 00:05:41,836
When you cried, you looked so pitiful.

159
00:05:41,837 --> 00:05:43,966
I looked more evil.

160
00:05:43,967 --> 00:05:47,336
I just dropped her home and went home.

161
00:05:47,337 --> 00:05:48,677
What did you do after dropping her home?

162
00:05:49,077 --> 00:05:50,276
- What do you mean?
- What did you do to her?

163
00:05:50,277 --> 00:05:51,476
- You should be criticized...
- But...

164
00:05:51,477 --> 00:05:52,646
for helping her get home.

165
00:05:52,647 --> 00:05:55,017
- We didn't see you go home.
- I...

166
00:05:55,217 --> 00:05:57,286
- I only helped her go in.
- We didn't see you go home.

167
00:05:57,287 --> 00:05:59,617
I went home after filming the scene where I helped her get home.

168
00:06:00,057 --> 00:06:01,726
I don't know what happened after that.

169
00:06:01,727 --> 00:06:04,157
You should have told them you needed a scene where you went home.

170
00:06:04,257 --> 00:06:06,597
Afterward, we didn't film a scene where I went home.

171
00:06:06,727 --> 00:06:08,627
- They only filmed his reaction.
- Right.

172
00:06:08,927 --> 00:06:10,727
Remember the present too?

173
00:06:11,137 --> 00:06:13,497
There are so many cute spots here on Jahamun-ro.

174
00:06:13,837 --> 00:06:15,137
- Where are we?
- My gosh.

175
00:06:15,307 --> 00:06:17,237
- Cheongwadae is behind here.
- Right.

176
00:06:17,437 --> 00:06:20,036
- We're in Hyoja-dong.
- Right.

177
00:06:20,037 --> 00:06:21,377
- Right. It was a long time ago.
- I see.

178
00:06:21,477 --> 00:06:23,377
- Have you been to Hyoja-dong?
- Hyoja-dong?

179
00:06:23,747 --> 00:06:25,847
From what I remember,

180
00:06:26,147 --> 00:06:28,016
I lived here until I was six...

181
00:06:28,017 --> 00:06:29,046
- since birth.
- You did?

182
00:06:29,047 --> 00:06:30,116
- Yes.
- What?

183
00:06:30,117 --> 00:06:31,156
- You did?
- You have ties to this place.

184
00:06:31,157 --> 00:06:32,986
- Yes.
- I didn't know you lived here.

185
00:06:32,987 --> 00:06:34,016
I did.

186
00:06:34,017 --> 00:06:37,826
Gosh, to be able to live within the four major gates,

187
00:06:37,827 --> 00:06:39,156
- When he was young.
- your families had to be noble...

188
00:06:39,157 --> 00:06:40,457
in the old times.

189
00:06:41,397 --> 00:06:43,096
- If this were a period piece, - Yes.

190
00:06:43,097 --> 00:06:44,797
he would've been from a noble family.

191
00:06:45,397 --> 00:06:46,996
(Staring at Jae Suk)

192
00:06:46,997 --> 00:06:49,267
- He probably rode horses.
- Hey.

193
00:06:49,567 --> 00:06:50,736
But...

194
00:06:50,737 --> 00:06:52,176
My gosh. Come on.

195
00:06:52,177 --> 00:06:53,507
(Getting angry in the morning)

196
00:06:54,277 --> 00:06:56,607
All right. We're filming our first episode...

197
00:06:56,977 --> 00:06:59,347
- with Je Hoon and Ye Jin.
- The first episode.

198
00:06:59,547 --> 00:07:01,716
Let's see what kind of client we'll get today.

199
00:07:01,717 --> 00:07:02,887
- Yes. Shall we?
- Yes.

200
00:07:03,417 --> 00:07:05,057
It's been a while since I opened this.

201
00:07:05,657 --> 00:07:06,816
- It's been a while.
- Yes.

202
00:07:06,817 --> 00:07:09,157
But it won't look fancy since it's our first episode.

203
00:07:09,657 --> 00:07:10,657
My gosh.

204
00:07:10,658 --> 00:07:11,697
It's our first episode.

205
00:07:11,997 --> 00:07:13,756
My gosh. It won't even drop down.

206
00:07:13,757 --> 00:07:14,866
Hey, we just started our season.

207
00:07:14,867 --> 00:07:16,766
- It used to drop down before.
- Right. Did it change?

208
00:07:16,767 --> 00:07:18,367
- We must film a few more episodes.
- But it's our first episode today.

209
00:07:18,697 --> 00:07:19,937
- There are no cards to drop down.
- I see.

210
00:07:20,037 --> 00:07:21,866
- My gosh.
- Here's our first Whenever Guest.

211
00:07:21,867 --> 00:07:23,337
It's Jung Si Hoo.

212
00:07:23,907 --> 00:07:25,436
"My left hand is there for support."

213
00:07:25,437 --> 00:07:27,276
"To become the national champion,"

214
00:07:27,277 --> 00:07:29,747
"I FMT even on a weekend."

215
00:07:30,047 --> 00:07:31,677
It stands for "finish my training."

216
00:07:32,077 --> 00:07:34,016
"My friends and I laughed and cried over the split-second moments..."

217
00:07:34,017 --> 00:07:35,586
"that determined the results."

218
00:07:35,587 --> 00:07:38,617
"But I'm preparing to say goodbye to them for a bigger stage now."

219
00:07:39,287 --> 00:07:42,027
"Please root for my last game with my juniors."

220
00:07:42,187 --> 00:07:43,526
He sounds like an athlete.

221
00:07:43,527 --> 00:07:44,856
- Is he going to quit?
- Right.

222
00:07:44,857 --> 00:07:46,126
- "My left hand only supports."
- Is he a runner?

223
00:07:46,127 --> 00:07:47,666
- Isn't that a basketball reference?
- Basketball.

224
00:07:47,667 --> 00:07:49,126
- Basketball.
- Right. It must be basketball.

225
00:07:49,127 --> 00:07:51,037
- It's a basketball reference.
- It's basketball.

226
00:07:51,467 --> 00:07:53,266
- Basketball?
- Are you good at basketball?

227
00:07:53,267 --> 00:07:55,166
- I'm not good at it.
- You're not?

228
00:07:55,167 --> 00:07:57,307
- I'm not good with ball sports.
- I see.

229
00:07:57,407 --> 00:07:58,476
What about you, Yeon Shik?

230
00:07:58,477 --> 00:07:59,677
- Yeon Shik?
- I...

231
00:08:00,207 --> 00:08:02,746
- I'm not good with big balls.
- Big balls.

232
00:08:02,747 --> 00:08:04,277
- Small ones like ping pong balls.
- Small ones like ping pong balls.

233
00:08:04,677 --> 00:08:05,877
- Ping pong balls and golf balls.
- Golf balls.

234
00:08:06,077 --> 00:08:08,717
- I'm good with small balls.
- I see.

235
00:08:09,287 --> 00:08:10,786
This is Kyungbock High School.

236
00:08:10,787 --> 00:08:12,287
Kyungbock High School?

237
00:08:12,487 --> 00:08:15,086
Is he on the basketball team and graduating soon?

238
00:08:15,087 --> 00:08:16,387
Or is he leaving the team?

239
00:08:17,227 --> 00:08:18,227
It's at the gym.

240
00:08:18,227 --> 00:08:19,227
- At the gym?
- Yes.

241
00:08:19,228 --> 00:08:20,396
- Shall we go?
- Shall we?

242
00:08:20,397 --> 00:08:21,997
- I've never been to this area.
- Seriously. This place...

243
00:08:22,697 --> 00:08:24,567
- You came from Sinan?
- Yes.

244
00:08:25,037 --> 00:08:26,336
- You must be so tired.
- But still.

245
00:08:26,337 --> 00:08:28,107
- I'm happy to be here.
- You know?

246
00:08:29,107 --> 00:08:30,977
- It's nice to be back in Seoul.
- Right.

247
00:08:31,237 --> 00:08:34,607
When you film for a long time out of Seoul,

248
00:08:34,847 --> 00:08:35,847
it's nice to be back in Seoul...

249
00:08:35,847 --> 00:08:36,847
- for a while.
- Yes.

250
00:08:36,977 --> 00:08:41,317
You know what? I once visited a production agency.

251
00:08:41,687 --> 00:08:44,016
- I watched your drama's teaser.
- Really?

252
00:08:44,017 --> 00:08:45,886
- It was for "Taxi Driver 3."
- I didn't get to watch it yet.

253
00:08:45,887 --> 00:08:47,316
Your drama looked like a blockbuster.

254
00:08:47,317 --> 00:08:49,356
You guys prepared a lot for this season.

255
00:08:49,357 --> 00:08:51,356
On his off days, Yeon Shik just doesn't rest up.

256
00:08:51,357 --> 00:08:53,657
- He butters up a lot of people.
- What do you mean?

257
00:08:55,297 --> 00:08:56,697
Jae Suk, seriously.

258
00:08:57,667 --> 00:08:58,967
- You know, I have to...
- What?

259
00:08:59,367 --> 00:09:01,706
- butter them up a lot these days.
- What?

260
00:09:01,707 --> 00:09:04,137
See? There's a reason behind his long career.

261
00:09:05,507 --> 00:09:07,677
He's very good at flattering people.

262
00:09:09,177 --> 00:09:10,707
You know what? This place...

263
00:09:11,617 --> 00:09:13,846
I always say this. It's a beautiful neighborhood.

264
00:09:13,847 --> 00:09:15,346
- It is.
- It's so beautiful.

265
00:09:15,347 --> 00:09:16,586
The alleys look beautiful.

266
00:09:16,587 --> 00:09:18,587
- Right. It's early in the morning.
- Yes.

267
00:09:18,817 --> 00:09:20,286
Gosh, what a picturesque street.

268
00:09:20,287 --> 00:09:22,886
I hear a lot of runners come to this neighborhood...

269
00:09:22,887 --> 00:09:25,526
- for a run.
- I saw them around the palace.

270
00:09:25,527 --> 00:09:26,796
Gosh, this place is popular now.

271
00:09:26,797 --> 00:09:29,697
I saw a group of 4 runners. And 1 of them was on the phone.

272
00:09:29,997 --> 00:09:31,537
I guess someone bailed.

273
00:09:32,667 --> 00:09:34,306
So the three of them crossed their arms...

274
00:09:34,307 --> 00:09:35,967
- and waited.
- With their arms crossed?

275
00:09:36,237 --> 00:09:37,306
- One of them was on the phone.
- I see.

276
00:09:37,307 --> 00:09:38,436
Should we cross here?

277
00:09:38,437 --> 00:09:39,937
- We have to cross?
- Should we cross here?

278
00:09:40,977 --> 00:09:42,306
Je Hoon, which high school did you go to?

279
00:09:42,307 --> 00:09:43,706
I went to high school in Uijeongbu.

280
00:09:43,707 --> 00:09:45,177
- Uijeongbu?
- Yes.

281
00:09:45,677 --> 00:09:47,076
I went to elementary, middle,

282
00:09:47,077 --> 00:09:48,487
- and high schools in Uijeongbu.
- I see.

283
00:09:49,147 --> 00:09:50,187
What about you, Ye Jin?

284
00:09:50,347 --> 00:09:52,986
I graduated in Changwon, South Gyeongsang Province.

285
00:09:52,987 --> 00:09:54,657
- You graduated in Changwon?
- Yes.

286
00:09:54,857 --> 00:09:57,027
- Changwon. Hold on.
- MCJ.

287
00:09:57,227 --> 00:09:58,326
- It's CMJ.
- Woo Jae...

288
00:09:58,327 --> 00:09:59,597
- What?
- It's CMJ.

289
00:10:00,897 --> 00:10:03,066
- She placed Changwon first.
- It's important for my pride.

290
00:10:03,067 --> 00:10:06,296
If you're going to be like that, I'll say JCM.

291
00:10:06,297 --> 00:10:08,567
- Are you from Jinhae?
- I'm from Jinju.

292
00:10:08,707 --> 00:10:10,867
- Jinju.
- Jinju doesn't count.

293
00:10:11,237 --> 00:10:13,276
- Does J stand for Jinhae?
- Yes, it's Jinhae.

294
00:10:13,277 --> 00:10:15,946
- It's not Jinju.
- MCJ or CMJ.

295
00:10:15,947 --> 00:10:17,976
- I didn't know the order mattered.
- Yes.

296
00:10:17,977 --> 00:10:19,646
- Some people care about this.
- We fight about this.

297
00:10:19,647 --> 00:10:21,286
- I see.
- CMJ.

298
00:10:21,287 --> 00:10:23,087
- Yes.
- We must be careful with the order.

299
00:10:23,187 --> 00:10:25,587
Yes. They're integrated as part of Changwon now.

300
00:10:26,117 --> 00:10:27,157
- I see.
- Yes.

301
00:10:27,287 --> 00:10:29,026
But I can say CJM, right?

302
00:10:29,027 --> 00:10:30,387
That doesn't matter.

303
00:10:31,097 --> 00:10:32,356
- That doesn't matter.
- The first initial matters.

304
00:10:32,357 --> 00:10:34,426
- As long as C is in the front.
- The rest doesn't matter?

305
00:10:34,427 --> 00:10:35,966
It's fine as long as C is the first initial.

306
00:10:35,967 --> 00:10:38,067
- C must be the first initial?
- Okay.

307
00:10:38,497 --> 00:10:39,796
My goodness.

308
00:10:39,797 --> 00:10:42,067
That didn't cross my mind. She really is from Changwon.

309
00:10:43,037 --> 00:10:44,936
- We can turn right from here.
- Gosh.

310
00:10:44,937 --> 00:10:46,477
- This is it.
- There it is.

311
00:10:46,577 --> 00:10:47,637
- I see.
- It was right here.

312
00:10:48,507 --> 00:10:50,206
We arrived exactly at the scheduled time.

313
00:10:50,207 --> 00:10:53,277
You know what? This looks like the old alley to school.

314
00:10:54,047 --> 00:10:55,086
I really like the vibe here.

315
00:10:55,087 --> 00:10:57,187
- Do you see the walls here?
- Yes, exactly.

316
00:10:57,347 --> 00:10:58,756
Walking here in a school uniform...

317
00:10:58,757 --> 00:11:00,117
- would feel great.
- Right?

318
00:11:00,417 --> 00:11:01,627
- But...
- Do you still have your uniform?

319
00:11:02,027 --> 00:11:03,957
I didn't have to wear one when I went to school.

320
00:11:05,527 --> 00:11:06,727
When was that?

321
00:11:06,857 --> 00:11:11,466
Students in the 80s didn't have to wear school uniforms.

322
00:11:11,467 --> 00:11:13,136
- Only for a few years, right?
- Only for a few years.

323
00:11:13,137 --> 00:11:15,006
- We went back to wearing uniforms.
- Our uniforms were black back then.

324
00:11:15,007 --> 00:11:16,136
- Right.
- Yes.

325
00:11:16,137 --> 00:11:17,837
- When I went to school...
- Like "Black Rubber Shoes?"

326
00:11:18,607 --> 00:11:21,106
- No?
- My gosh. That brat.

327
00:11:21,107 --> 00:11:23,677
- Wait. There's a payphone.
- I haven't seen one in a while.

328
00:11:24,447 --> 00:11:26,417
- It's been a while.
- It's been so long.

329
00:11:26,517 --> 00:11:27,646
I haven't seen one in a while.

330
00:11:27,647 --> 00:11:29,116
- Does it work?
- I haven't seen one in ages.

331
00:11:29,117 --> 00:11:30,386
There's a payphone...

332
00:11:30,387 --> 00:11:31,617
- in front of the school.
- I can insert a card.

333
00:11:32,557 --> 00:11:34,187
- Bukak Festival will be held.
- And coins too.

334
00:11:34,627 --> 00:11:36,486
- It's the 104th festival.
- The 104th festival?

335
00:11:36,487 --> 00:11:37,556
- That's next week.
- The school has been here...

336
00:11:37,557 --> 00:11:38,656
for over a century.

337
00:11:38,657 --> 00:11:40,397
They already had it yesterday.

338
00:11:40,627 --> 00:11:41,766
Hello.

339
00:11:41,767 --> 00:11:43,296
- Hello.
- Hello.

340
00:11:43,297 --> 00:11:44,767
You guys had the festival yesterday, right?

341
00:11:45,397 --> 00:11:46,567
- Is it over now?
- It's over.

342
00:11:47,297 --> 00:11:48,936
Was it a successful one?

343
00:11:48,937 --> 00:11:49,937
(Yes)

344
00:11:50,537 --> 00:11:53,206
Which way is to the gym?

345
00:11:53,207 --> 00:11:54,276
The basketball team is over there.

346
00:11:54,277 --> 00:11:55,607
- Is the basketball team there?
- I see. This way?

347
00:11:55,877 --> 00:11:56,976
- There.
- Over there.

348
00:11:56,977 --> 00:11:58,277
- Into the alley.
- Go into the alley.

349
00:11:58,377 --> 00:12:00,277
- Okay. Thank you.
- Thank you.

350
00:12:00,977 --> 00:12:03,246
- He gave us a hint.
- It already...

351
00:12:03,247 --> 00:12:04,287
A basketball team.

352
00:12:04,487 --> 00:12:06,087
The school is so big.

353
00:12:06,757 --> 00:12:09,527
- Gosh, this is a great school.
- There's a hill.

354
00:12:09,857 --> 00:12:10,957
- This way?
- My gosh.

355
00:12:12,897 --> 00:12:15,127
- The scenery looks great here.
- Right?

356
00:12:15,597 --> 00:12:18,897
Oh, my. There's a mountain right behind the school.

357
00:12:20,937 --> 00:12:23,607
- Hold on. Is that...
- Is that the gym?

358
00:12:23,707 --> 00:12:25,707
- Is this the gym?
- This looks like the gym.

359
00:12:27,137 --> 00:12:28,207
There?

360
00:12:29,707 --> 00:12:31,106
- Hold on. This place...
- Wait. It's this place.

361
00:12:31,107 --> 00:12:32,816
- Look for Jung Si Hoo.
- The light is on.

362
00:12:32,817 --> 00:12:34,147
- Si Hoo?
- Si Hoo.

363
00:12:34,547 --> 00:12:36,347
They're high school seniors.

364
00:12:37,317 --> 00:12:38,757
Gosh, they're already in the gym.

365
00:12:39,987 --> 00:12:41,157
I see them.

366
00:12:42,487 --> 00:12:44,356
- They're already here.
- They're training in the morning.

367
00:12:44,357 --> 00:12:47,227
- Gosh.
- Who's Si Hoo?

368
00:12:47,297 --> 00:12:49,366
- That's me.
- Nice to meet you.

369
00:12:49,367 --> 00:12:51,497
- Hello.
- Can we enter with our shoes on?

370
00:12:51,567 --> 00:12:52,567
Yes.

371
00:12:53,597 --> 00:12:55,306
- Hello.
- Hello.

372
00:12:55,307 --> 00:12:56,366
(He's with his basketball team.)

373
00:12:56,367 --> 00:12:57,467
- Gosh.
- Oh, my.

374
00:12:57,537 --> 00:12:59,436
(This is the basketball court at Kyungbock High School.)

375
00:12:59,437 --> 00:13:02,146
- This place is huge.
- What a nice gym.

376
00:13:02,147 --> 00:13:03,977
Look. They have workout machines.

377
00:13:04,177 --> 00:13:06,217
- They have workout machines.
- They have workout machines.

378
00:13:06,377 --> 00:13:08,216
Kyungbock High School is famous for its basketball team.

379
00:13:08,217 --> 00:13:09,217
- Yes.
- I see.

380
00:13:09,217 --> 00:13:10,217
Nice to meet you.

381
00:13:10,218 --> 00:13:12,216
(They finally meet the first Whenever Guest.)

382
00:13:12,217 --> 00:13:13,886
- Si Hoo. You're in your last year.
- Yes.

383
00:13:13,887 --> 00:13:16,726
- Je Hoon and Ye Jin are joining us.
- Hello.

384
00:13:16,727 --> 00:13:17,756
(First Whenever Guest, Jung Si Hoo)

385
00:13:17,757 --> 00:13:19,297
- Nice to meet you.
- Hello.

386
00:13:19,727 --> 00:13:21,057
How did you hurt your nose?

387
00:13:21,597 --> 00:13:23,626
- I got the surgery done yesterday.
- Gosh.

388
00:13:23,627 --> 00:13:25,367
- You got injured during a game.
- You got injured.

389
00:13:26,967 --> 00:13:28,806
- You get elbowed during games.
- Yes.

390
00:13:28,807 --> 00:13:30,866
- Why don't we sit down and talk?
- Yes.

391
00:13:30,867 --> 00:13:32,237
(They will sit down to have a conversation.)

392
00:13:32,407 --> 00:13:34,377
- This is crazy.
- This is insane.

393
00:13:35,577 --> 00:13:37,246
- His face is so small.
- My gosh.

394
00:13:37,247 --> 00:13:39,517
- They're both from "Taxi Driver."
- Look at them.

395
00:13:41,447 --> 00:13:43,047
What a nice gym this is.

396
00:13:44,887 --> 00:13:46,586
- It was founded in 1921.
- What?

397
00:13:46,587 --> 00:13:48,056
It's been 104 years.

398
00:13:48,057 --> 00:13:49,157
(The basketball team has a history of 104 years.)

399
00:13:49,557 --> 00:13:50,886
Kyungbock High School has...

400
00:13:50,887 --> 00:13:52,256
- a prestigious basketball team.
- Indeed.

401
00:13:52,257 --> 00:13:53,626
(Glorious moments fill the gym.)

402
00:13:53,627 --> 00:13:56,867
I can't believe I'm meeting Kyungbock High's basketball team.

403
00:13:57,097 --> 00:13:58,436
(Chun Hee Chul, Woo Ji Won, Ham Ji Hoon, Moon Seong Gon...)

404
00:13:58,437 --> 00:14:02,737
(Kyungbock High School fostered many legendary basketball players.)

405
00:14:03,667 --> 00:14:05,606
(The school's prestige remains strong.)

406
00:14:05,607 --> 00:14:07,577
("Kyungbock High School Wins Gold Medal After 11 Years")

407
00:14:08,007 --> 00:14:09,646
Kyungbock High is a prestigious school for basketball.

408
00:14:09,647 --> 00:14:10,977
Yes, that's right.

409
00:14:11,717 --> 00:14:16,047
Si Hoo is a high school senior on the basketball team.

410
00:14:16,287 --> 00:14:18,916
He's the one who applied to be on our show today.

411
00:14:18,917 --> 00:14:20,616
(Jung Si Hoo, Song Young Hoon, Lee Hak Hyun, Kim Ho Won,)

412
00:14:20,617 --> 00:14:22,186
(Lee Ji Ho, Yoon Ji Hoon, Yoon Ji Won)

413
00:14:22,187 --> 00:14:24,586
Si Hoo, what made you write to our show?

414
00:14:24,587 --> 00:14:25,896
(Si Hoo wrote a letter to the show.)

415
00:14:25,897 --> 00:14:27,457
First of all, our basketball team...

416
00:14:28,197 --> 00:14:29,296
won the championship...

417
00:14:29,297 --> 00:14:30,726
at the National Sports Festival two days ago.

418
00:14:30,727 --> 00:14:33,637
(They won the championship two days ago.)

419
00:14:34,907 --> 00:14:39,007
(The championship was held two days ago.)

420
00:14:40,507 --> 00:14:42,607
(Throughout the game, they dominated the opposing team.)

421
00:14:43,607 --> 00:14:45,277
What a nice way to wrap up.

422
00:14:46,247 --> 00:14:49,587
(They proudly won with the score difference of 39 points.)

423
00:14:50,017 --> 00:14:51,986
Kyungbock High School won by a landslide...

424
00:14:51,987 --> 00:14:52,987
with 39 points ahead.

425
00:14:52,988 --> 00:14:55,757
(Kyungbock High School)

426
00:14:56,727 --> 00:14:58,596
I told you. Their basketball team has a prestigious reputation.

427
00:14:58,597 --> 00:15:00,557
- That's right.
- They're great basketball players.

428
00:15:01,057 --> 00:15:03,326
- It felt great to win.
- Yes.

429
00:15:03,327 --> 00:15:05,396
- I'm graduating soon.
- Right.

430
00:15:05,397 --> 00:15:07,366
I wanted to create...

431
00:15:07,367 --> 00:15:08,666
good memories with my basketball team.

432
00:15:08,667 --> 00:15:09,967
That's why I wrote to the show.

433
00:15:10,407 --> 00:15:13,576
So some of you will go pro...

434
00:15:13,577 --> 00:15:15,176
- or go to college?
- Yes. That's right.

435
00:15:15,177 --> 00:15:17,206
What about you? What's next for you, Si Hoo?

436
00:15:17,207 --> 00:15:18,447
I'll be attending Sungkyunkwan University.

437
00:15:19,347 --> 00:15:20,676
- To Hyehwa-dong.
- Sungkyunkwan University.

438
00:15:20,677 --> 00:15:23,187
- You're going to Hyehwa-dong.
- That's so cool.

439
00:15:24,647 --> 00:15:27,217
Si Hoo. What's your position?

440
00:15:27,717 --> 00:15:29,686
I play forward.

441
00:15:29,687 --> 00:15:31,126
- You play forward.
- Forward.

442
00:15:31,127 --> 00:15:33,497
What about you, Hak Hyun?

443
00:15:33,527 --> 00:15:35,367
- I'm the point guard.
- Point guard?

444
00:15:35,697 --> 00:15:37,697
- That's how they say it now.
- I knew you were a point guard.

445
00:15:37,827 --> 00:15:39,067
- "Guard."
- Does anyone here play center?

446
00:15:39,197 --> 00:15:40,497
(Raising his hand)

447
00:15:40,797 --> 00:15:42,637
Ho Won plays center? He's in 11th grade.

448
00:15:43,507 --> 00:15:45,476
Ho Won, are you tall?

449
00:15:45,477 --> 00:15:46,507
My height is 195cm.

450
00:15:47,277 --> 00:15:49,477
- You'll get even taller.
- Right.

451
00:15:49,607 --> 00:15:51,977
When did you hit your growth spurt?

452
00:15:52,717 --> 00:15:53,747
I've been growing consistently.

453
00:15:54,887 --> 00:15:58,457
- He's so boring.
- He's getting nutritious meals.

454
00:15:58,657 --> 00:16:01,086
- When Ho Won answered that, - Consistently.

455
00:16:01,087 --> 00:16:02,286
they said, "He's boring."

456
00:16:02,287 --> 00:16:03,557
(Pointing out his boring, but honest answer)

457
00:16:03,827 --> 00:16:05,827
How can he be funny about his height?

458
00:16:06,357 --> 00:16:09,366
- Ji Ho. Height can't be funny.
- Honestly...

459
00:16:09,367 --> 00:16:10,896
- So...
- Young Hoon?

460
00:16:10,897 --> 00:16:12,667
I'm the energizer of the team.

461
00:16:13,497 --> 00:16:16,806
Since you're the energizer,

462
00:16:16,807 --> 00:16:18,636
- you must've played passionately.
- I was enthusiastic.

463
00:16:18,637 --> 00:16:22,046
- I can't talk clearly.
- Young Hoon.

464
00:16:22,047 --> 00:16:24,377
I get that you wanted to be here for the show.

465
00:16:24,817 --> 00:16:26,846
Shouldn't you be resting now?

466
00:16:26,847 --> 00:16:28,716
I was supposed to have the surgery today.

467
00:16:28,717 --> 00:16:30,286
But I got it done yesterday to be on the show.

468
00:16:30,287 --> 00:16:31,716
- My gosh.
- Wait.

469
00:16:31,717 --> 00:16:33,016
You pushed up your surgery?

470
00:16:33,017 --> 00:16:35,356
- Yes. I got it done yesterday.
- Right now,

471
00:16:35,357 --> 00:16:36,986
his nose is covered.

472
00:16:36,987 --> 00:16:38,626
- He can't breathe well.
- Are you all right?

473
00:16:38,627 --> 00:16:39,856
- Young Hoon.
- I'm okay.

474
00:16:39,857 --> 00:16:41,057
- Are you okay?
- Yes.

475
00:16:42,267 --> 00:16:44,167
You're going to graduate soon.

476
00:16:44,297 --> 00:16:46,637
Hak Hyun, how do you feel about graduating?

477
00:16:47,637 --> 00:16:50,406
I was held back a year.

478
00:16:50,407 --> 00:16:51,776
So I stayed a year longer than the others.

479
00:16:51,777 --> 00:16:54,377
- I spent four years in this school.
- My gosh.

480
00:16:55,047 --> 00:16:56,376
- Why did you get held back?
- He's practically a college boy.

481
00:16:56,377 --> 00:16:57,506
- A college student.
- I...

482
00:16:57,507 --> 00:16:58,547
A college student?

483
00:17:01,217 --> 00:17:04,816
So a part of me is sad, but I'm liberated at the same time.

484
00:17:04,817 --> 00:17:07,486
- "At last, I'm graduating."
- "Yes."

485
00:17:07,487 --> 00:17:08,626
(He's ready to be a college student without regrets.)

486
00:17:08,627 --> 00:17:10,287
- You must feel liberated.
- Yes. Totally.

487
00:17:10,827 --> 00:17:12,256
What about you, Ji Ho?

488
00:17:12,257 --> 00:17:14,526
Two days ago when we won the gold medal,

489
00:17:14,527 --> 00:17:15,997
I couldn't stop tearing up.

490
00:17:16,297 --> 00:17:19,036
When I thought how it was my last game with them,

491
00:17:19,037 --> 00:17:20,067
I was so sad.

492
00:17:20,297 --> 00:17:22,407
I wished that I could play with them again.

493
00:17:22,567 --> 00:17:25,206
Your seniors are leaving soon. How do you feel?

494
00:17:25,207 --> 00:17:26,276
Ji Hoon?

495
00:17:26,277 --> 00:17:28,177
Part of me actually feels relieved.

496
00:17:28,947 --> 00:17:30,107
Relieved?

497
00:17:31,547 --> 00:17:33,376
- He's honest.
- Right.

498
00:17:33,377 --> 00:17:34,747
Of course.

499
00:17:34,777 --> 00:17:36,817
It's like, "I'm the top dog here."

500
00:17:37,087 --> 00:17:38,387
- So you're relieved.
- Gosh.

501
00:17:38,617 --> 00:17:39,856
- What is it?
- No.

502
00:17:39,857 --> 00:17:42,856
- I was really good to him.
- You were?

503
00:17:42,857 --> 00:17:46,256
- He was good to Ji Hoon.
- I'm glad you were good to him.

504
00:17:46,257 --> 00:17:48,726
But it has nothing to do with that. That's how people feel.

505
00:17:48,727 --> 00:17:50,167
- Right?
- Of course.

506
00:17:50,597 --> 00:17:51,666
When you say, "guard,"

507
00:17:51,667 --> 00:17:52,697
why do you emphasize the first syllable?

508
00:17:53,167 --> 00:17:55,937
When we say it, we just put the accent on the first syllable.

509
00:17:56,207 --> 00:17:57,207
- I see.
- "Guard."

510
00:17:57,667 --> 00:17:59,006
- Are there other terms...
- "Guard."

511
00:17:59,007 --> 00:18:01,606
only basketball players use that regular people wouldn't know?

512
00:18:01,607 --> 00:18:03,277
Is there any secret jargon like "guard?"

513
00:18:03,507 --> 00:18:05,317
- We mimic the swooshing sound.
- What's that?

514
00:18:05,817 --> 00:18:08,586
Let's say our coach steps outside.

515
00:18:08,587 --> 00:18:10,187
- We should be training.
- Yes.

516
00:18:10,317 --> 00:18:12,086
- But we would be goofing around.
- Oh, that?

517
00:18:12,087 --> 00:18:13,856
When we see his silhouette,

518
00:18:13,857 --> 00:18:15,857
we mimic that sound. That means our coach is back.

519
00:18:16,787 --> 00:18:19,197
- You suddenly start training.
- You'd start dribbling.

520
00:18:20,357 --> 00:18:22,366
So what would you do then?

521
00:18:22,367 --> 00:18:23,897
We'd pretend we were training.

522
00:18:25,637 --> 00:18:27,996
- Could you stand up and show us?
- What?

523
00:18:27,997 --> 00:18:29,306
Let's say you're just resting.

524
00:18:29,307 --> 00:18:31,906
- So you're chatting like this.
- So you're not training.

525
00:18:31,907 --> 00:18:34,637
Your coach is back. You can sense your coach coming.

526
00:18:35,847 --> 00:18:38,007
(He starts shooting a 3-pointer out of the blue.)

527
00:18:38,147 --> 00:18:39,217
What?

528
00:18:39,877 --> 00:18:40,877
(Mimicking)

529
00:18:42,087 --> 00:18:44,517
(He shoots a 3-pointer as soon as he gets up.)

530
00:18:44,717 --> 00:18:45,887
(It goes in.)

531
00:18:46,657 --> 00:18:49,186
(They were laughing at his act and then surprised by his shot.)

532
00:18:49,187 --> 00:18:51,287
- And he still made the shot.
- It went in right away.

533
00:18:51,357 --> 00:18:52,656
- It went in right away.
- Hey.

534
00:18:52,657 --> 00:18:53,727
- It went in right away.
- Gosh.

535
00:18:54,397 --> 00:18:56,867
(That's the class of a student who spent 4 years here.)

536
00:18:57,267 --> 00:18:59,336
- He's good.
- That was so smooth.

537
00:18:59,337 --> 00:19:00,337
(Smiling proudly)

538
00:19:00,337 --> 00:19:01,337
He's indeed the best.

539
00:19:01,537 --> 00:19:02,566
He was sitting down...

540
00:19:02,567 --> 00:19:03,606
- only a moment ago.
- He's our captain.

541
00:19:03,607 --> 00:19:04,977
- He made the shot.
- Gosh, I knew it.

542
00:19:05,207 --> 00:19:06,737
It seemed you didn't even look at the hoop.

543
00:19:06,807 --> 00:19:08,947
- Gosh.
- He's indeed an athlete.

544
00:19:09,447 --> 00:19:10,847
How do you guys select the captain?

545
00:19:11,077 --> 00:19:12,517
We vote.

546
00:19:12,977 --> 00:19:14,046
The vote was unanimous.

547
00:19:14,047 --> 00:19:15,317
The vote was unanimous?

548
00:19:15,487 --> 00:19:16,946
He was here for four years.

549
00:19:16,947 --> 00:19:18,356
- What?
- He was here for four years.

550
00:19:18,357 --> 00:19:20,387
- He was here for four years.
- I see.

551
00:19:22,287 --> 00:19:24,757
Since he was here for four years...

552
00:19:24,857 --> 00:19:25,956
We all voted for him.

553
00:19:25,957 --> 00:19:27,157
He got a benefit.

554
00:19:28,127 --> 00:19:30,296
I'm sure you must be sad that you're graduating.

555
00:19:30,297 --> 00:19:33,037
But you're going off to college soon.

556
00:19:33,237 --> 00:19:34,936
What do you want to do once you start college?

557
00:19:34,937 --> 00:19:36,136
- Oh, right.
- Yes.

558
00:19:36,137 --> 00:19:37,506
- What do you want to do?
- They must be excited.

559
00:19:37,507 --> 00:19:39,007
- What are you looking forward to?
- Dating on campus.

560
00:19:40,437 --> 00:19:41,647
- Dating?
- Dating.

561
00:19:42,547 --> 00:19:43,547
Dating on campus?

562
00:19:43,547 --> 00:19:44,547
(Shy)

563
00:19:44,548 --> 00:19:45,976
- He's still full of energy...
- Dating on campus?

564
00:19:45,977 --> 00:19:47,376
- even after his surgery.
- Yes.

565
00:19:47,377 --> 00:19:49,317
- He's indeed the energizer.
- He kept saying, "dating."

566
00:19:49,647 --> 00:19:51,116
(Chuckling)

567
00:19:51,117 --> 00:19:52,857
So that's one. What else?

568
00:19:53,487 --> 00:19:56,086
- I don't have a girlfriend.
- Oh, you don't.

569
00:19:56,087 --> 00:19:57,557
- So you want the same thing, right?
- Yes, that's right.

570
00:19:58,157 --> 00:19:59,456
It's all about dating in the end.

571
00:19:59,457 --> 00:20:01,226
- That's it.
- Yes, it's the same thing.

572
00:20:01,227 --> 00:20:03,426
It's the same thing. You know what? Like we talked about,

573
00:20:03,427 --> 00:20:06,066
it was really cool to see him make the shot earlier.

574
00:20:06,067 --> 00:20:08,236
- His shooting form was great.
- Could you show us a bit more?

575
00:20:08,237 --> 00:20:10,536
Can't you show us a few shots? Two days ago...

576
00:20:10,537 --> 00:20:11,606
Just a few.

577
00:20:11,607 --> 00:20:14,337
(They'll check out the team's skills before the mission.)

578
00:20:14,777 --> 00:20:16,246
- Wait.
- What should we do?

579
00:20:16,247 --> 00:20:17,876
- What do we do?
- Let's go.

580
00:20:17,877 --> 00:20:19,517
- What should we show them?
- It's...

581
00:20:19,577 --> 00:20:21,116
- Can you do a dunk?
- A dunk?

582
00:20:21,117 --> 00:20:22,147
- Show them.
- No.

583
00:20:22,647 --> 00:20:24,546
- What would you like to see?
- Is there anything...

584
00:20:24,547 --> 00:20:26,856
It could be a layup or a pass.

585
00:20:26,857 --> 00:20:28,556
- Or a dunk.
- I see.

586
00:20:28,557 --> 00:20:30,486
- A layup.
- A layup.

587
00:20:30,487 --> 00:20:31,526
(Demonstrating a layup)

588
00:20:31,527 --> 00:20:33,327
(Si Hoo, the 12th grader)

589
00:20:39,897 --> 00:20:42,166
(A light movement)

590
00:20:42,167 --> 00:20:43,267
His movement was light.

591
00:20:43,737 --> 00:20:46,077
Can you show us a three-pointer, Point Guard?

592
00:20:46,537 --> 00:20:48,577
(The energizer is on the court.)

593
00:20:57,787 --> 00:20:59,987
(A nice shot)

594
00:21:00,417 --> 00:21:01,586
He has a celebratory move.

595
00:21:01,587 --> 00:21:02,886
- My gosh.
- He's the energizer.

596
00:21:02,887 --> 00:21:05,396
- His nose is injured.
- He has a celebratory move.

597
00:21:05,397 --> 00:21:07,727
He has a celebratory move.

598
00:21:08,327 --> 00:21:10,227
Je Hoon, why don't you try?

599
00:21:11,967 --> 00:21:13,096
Pass it to him.

600
00:21:13,097 --> 00:21:14,396
(He confidently catches the ball...)

601
00:21:14,397 --> 00:21:16,537
(and runs toward the rim.)

602
00:21:24,007 --> 00:21:27,277
(He pretends to have made the shot with his acting skills.)

603
00:21:27,817 --> 00:21:31,317
My gosh. He did that with his dress shoes on.

604
00:21:32,617 --> 00:21:34,386
You try it, Yeon Shik.

605
00:21:34,387 --> 00:21:35,757
- Me?
- Let's go, Yeon Seok.

606
00:21:36,427 --> 00:21:38,257
- Yeon Shik.
- How do I do this?

607
00:21:38,287 --> 00:21:39,497
I bet he's good.

608
00:21:40,127 --> 00:21:41,156
What?

609
00:21:41,157 --> 00:21:42,967
(His fast dribble gets them excited.)

610
00:21:43,027 --> 00:21:44,067
I bet he's good.

611
00:21:44,697 --> 00:21:45,697
What?

612
00:21:57,147 --> 00:21:58,746
- This is tough.
- Let me try it.

613
00:21:58,747 --> 00:22:00,216
- It's hard.
- Good luck.

614
00:22:00,217 --> 00:22:01,716
- There he is.
- He's going for it.

615
00:22:01,717 --> 00:22:03,786
(He exchanges passes like he's seen on TV.)

616
00:22:03,787 --> 00:22:05,356
- Did you see that?
- He's going for it.

617
00:22:05,357 --> 00:22:06,517
No pressure.

618
00:22:08,857 --> 00:22:11,527
- Okay. All right.
- My gosh.

619
00:22:17,867 --> 00:22:19,336
(It's hard to make a shot.)

620
00:22:19,337 --> 00:22:21,366
- None of us could make the shot.
- It's hard.

621
00:22:21,367 --> 00:22:23,266
- How come none of us could do this?
- My gosh.

622
00:22:23,267 --> 00:22:25,607
- Wait.
- Ye Jin, you try it.

623
00:22:25,777 --> 00:22:28,106
- I don't know how. Can I do it?
- Pass it to Ye Jin.

624
00:22:28,107 --> 00:22:29,146
(She's never played basketball.)

625
00:22:29,147 --> 00:22:30,377
How do you do this?

626
00:22:30,607 --> 00:22:31,877
- It's okay, Ye Jin.
- Okay.

627
00:22:32,847 --> 00:22:34,977
(She starts dribbling like she's seen on TV.)

628
00:22:35,647 --> 00:22:38,517
(Super responsive)

629
00:22:45,127 --> 00:22:47,927
(It went in!)

630
00:22:48,057 --> 00:22:49,327
(Cheering)

631
00:22:51,937 --> 00:22:53,936
- It went in. But how?
- You've got talent.

632
00:22:53,937 --> 00:22:55,506
- Nice.
- She's got a knack.

633
00:22:55,507 --> 00:22:57,507
- Well done.
- Good job.

634
00:22:57,837 --> 00:22:58,936
I'm all set now.

635
00:22:58,937 --> 00:23:00,307
(Basketball is fun.)

636
00:23:00,677 --> 00:23:02,076
(Mission time)

637
00:23:02,077 --> 00:23:03,706
(But before that)

638
00:23:03,707 --> 00:23:06,477
(Bonus coupon draw)

639
00:23:06,517 --> 00:23:08,076
(A coupon that allows the Whenever Guest...)

640
00:23:08,077 --> 00:23:10,946
(to participate in a mission in the place of one of the members)

641
00:23:10,947 --> 00:23:14,457
(When the coupon is used, it doesn't count as a try.)

642
00:23:14,557 --> 00:23:16,656
Depending on the outcome,

643
00:23:16,657 --> 00:23:18,856
our Whenever Guests...

644
00:23:18,857 --> 00:23:19,926
will be able to participate...

645
00:23:19,927 --> 00:23:21,427
- without using any tries.
- That's right.

646
00:23:21,627 --> 00:23:23,626
All right, give him the dice.

647
00:23:23,627 --> 00:23:25,766
- I'll roll for the coupon.
- It's from 0 to 2.

648
00:23:25,767 --> 00:23:26,767
- Yes.
- Good luck.

649
00:23:38,777 --> 00:23:41,277
(Obtained 1 coupon)

650
00:23:41,917 --> 00:23:43,687
- It's enough.
- One isn't bad.

651
00:23:43,717 --> 00:23:45,487
Gosh, this is a first in a while.

652
00:23:46,117 --> 00:23:49,126
- Si Hoo will draw one.
- Here.

653
00:23:49,127 --> 00:23:50,257
The first one.

654
00:23:50,527 --> 00:23:52,496
- I'm so nervous.
- What is it?

655
00:23:52,497 --> 00:23:53,857
- An expensive one.
- Crack it here.

656
00:23:54,097 --> 00:23:56,197
Here, crack it using this part.

657
00:23:57,067 --> 00:23:58,127
That's it.

658
00:23:59,397 --> 00:24:00,997
Read it out loud. What does it say?

659
00:24:01,367 --> 00:24:02,507
"We're about to graduate."

660
00:24:02,707 --> 00:24:05,007
"I want a last friendship trip with my fellow seniors."

661
00:24:05,337 --> 00:24:07,206
"Round-trip airfare to Jeju Island for three people."

662
00:24:07,207 --> 00:24:08,947
(Round 1 prize: Round-trip airfare to Jeju Island for 3)

663
00:24:09,947 --> 00:24:11,277
- For real?
- Unbelievable.

664
00:24:12,047 --> 00:24:13,076
(Round-trip airfare to Jeju Island)

665
00:24:13,077 --> 00:24:14,216
Round-trip to Jeju Island.

666
00:24:14,217 --> 00:24:15,717
- Nice.
- It's perfect for you three.

667
00:24:15,847 --> 00:24:17,687
Right? The trip is for you three.

668
00:24:17,887 --> 00:24:19,216
- Three.
- Nice.

669
00:24:19,217 --> 00:24:20,816
- Oh, my.
- What's the game?

670
00:24:20,817 --> 00:24:22,986
(Shooting Challenge)

671
00:24:22,987 --> 00:24:26,857
(Take turns shooting the ball and reach the target score to succeed.)

672
00:24:26,897 --> 00:24:29,997

- Yes.

Within ten shots?

676
00:24:38,407 --> 00:24:40,837
- Out of 10?
- No, each player gets 1 turn.

677
00:24:40,977 --> 00:24:42,577
We each get 1 turn?

678
00:24:42,707 --> 00:24:43,806
(3 points with 4 players?)

679
00:24:43,807 --> 00:24:44,876
- Wait.
- Three?

680
00:24:44,877 --> 00:24:46,176
- Three players?
- Is it three players?

681
00:24:46,177 --> 00:24:48,076
- No, four players.
- Three points by four players.

682
00:24:48,077 --> 00:24:49,217
- Three points.
- I see.

683
00:24:50,617 --> 00:24:52,117
We can totally do it, no?

684
00:24:53,917 --> 00:24:57,027
(Can you do it?)

685
00:24:57,527 --> 00:24:59,026
Can't they teach us?

686
00:24:59,027 --> 00:25:00,197
We can do it, no?

687
00:25:00,327 --> 00:25:01,327
This is worrisome.

688
00:25:01,328 --> 00:25:02,367
- I'm scared.
- Really...

689
00:25:02,567 --> 00:25:03,726
Because...

690
00:25:03,727 --> 00:25:06,166
- Either take a 3-pointer...
- Yes, take a 3-pointer...

691
00:25:06,167 --> 00:25:07,337
- or a free throw.
- Right.

692
00:25:07,597 --> 00:25:09,267
Or one point at the free throw line, right?

693
00:25:09,367 --> 00:25:10,506
We'd better practice.

694
00:25:10,507 --> 00:25:12,206
- What's a free throw?
- From here.

695
00:25:12,207 --> 00:25:13,476
- I see.
- If you shoot...

696
00:25:13,477 --> 00:25:14,776
and the ball goes in...

697
00:25:14,777 --> 00:25:16,777
from this line, it's worth one point.

698
00:25:16,977 --> 00:25:20,047
Should 1 player shoot a 3-pointer?

699
00:25:20,177 --> 00:25:21,547
- If...
- Yes?

700
00:25:21,847 --> 00:25:23,486
three of us fail, the last player...

701
00:25:23,487 --> 00:25:25,147
has to shoot a three-pointer.

702
00:25:25,587 --> 00:25:26,616
I feel the pressure.

703
00:25:26,617 --> 00:25:27,617
- This is really...
- It's hard.

704
00:25:27,618 --> 00:25:29,687
One of us four will be able to score a point.

705
00:25:30,427 --> 00:25:32,026
- Teach us.
- Please teach us.

706
00:25:32,027 --> 00:25:33,957
- Shooter.
- From here?

707
00:25:34,057 --> 00:25:36,126
- Try to hit the backboard.
- The backboard.

708
00:25:36,127 --> 00:25:37,426
Think of hitting the ring at the back.

709
00:25:37,427 --> 00:25:38,736
- What ring?
- The rectangle.

710
00:25:38,737 --> 00:25:40,867
- The rectangle.
- Target that rectangle.

711
00:25:41,497 --> 00:25:43,566
- That's not easy.
- Try to make a long shot.

712
00:25:43,567 --> 00:25:45,066
- Okay.
- Make a long shot.

713
00:25:45,067 --> 00:25:46,737
(Si Hoo's shooting tip: Make a long shot.)

714
00:25:48,707 --> 00:25:50,676
Imagine hitting the ring at the back.

715
00:25:50,677 --> 00:25:52,677
So hit the rectangle on the board, right?

716
00:25:53,817 --> 00:25:54,817
Here!

717
00:25:55,447 --> 00:25:56,846
- I'm sorry.
- From below...

718
00:25:56,847 --> 00:25:58,216
- But...
- What do I do?

719
00:25:58,217 --> 00:25:59,717
What if the ball hits your nose?

720
00:25:59,917 --> 00:26:01,987
- It's all right.
- Sorry.

721
00:26:02,557 --> 00:26:05,527
- A three-pointer.
- Jae Suk, in the past...

722
00:26:06,497 --> 00:26:07,756
For a drama...

723
00:26:07,757 --> 00:26:08,927
(He learned basketball for acting.)

724
00:26:09,927 --> 00:26:11,067
Hold on.

725
00:26:11,727 --> 00:26:12,936
Hold on.

726
00:26:12,937 --> 00:26:15,567
- Throw it higher.
- Okay.

727
00:26:17,907 --> 00:26:19,436
- Throw it further.
- Hold on.

728
00:26:19,437 --> 00:26:20,907
It's been a while. Give me a second.

729
00:26:24,977 --> 00:26:26,447
Not a single shot goes in.

730
00:26:27,577 --> 00:26:30,187
How about we go for a three-pointer?

731
00:26:30,617 --> 00:26:31,746
Wait a minute.

732
00:26:31,747 --> 00:26:33,587
Je Hoon's three-pointer.

733
00:26:33,857 --> 00:26:35,116
A three-pointer, Je Hoon?

734
00:26:35,117 --> 00:26:36,427
(Je Hoon aims a 3-pointer.)

735
00:26:37,427 --> 00:26:39,497
- Nice.
- This might be better.

736
00:26:41,657 --> 00:26:44,967
(The 3-pointer almost went in!)

737
00:26:44,997 --> 00:26:47,597
(Surprised)

738
00:26:47,767 --> 00:26:49,707
- I'll go for a 3-pointer.
- A 3-pointer is better.

739
00:26:49,807 --> 00:26:50,837
Right?

740
00:26:50,937 --> 00:26:51,937
Or...

741
00:26:51,938 --> 00:26:53,576
(Changing his shooting posture)

742
00:26:53,577 --> 00:26:55,177
- We're in trouble.
- Even just one point.

743
00:26:56,247 --> 00:26:57,347
- What?
- That's...

744
00:26:59,117 --> 00:27:00,576
(Succeeded a 3-pointer shot)

745
00:27:00,577 --> 00:27:02,747
- You did it!
- To think that'd work!

746
00:27:03,387 --> 00:27:06,317
- Yes, this will work!
- What?

747
00:27:06,687 --> 00:27:07,756
- This is better, right?
- Yes.

748
00:27:07,757 --> 00:27:09,986
- Or all 3 can try for a 3-pointer.
- Let's go for 3 points.

749
00:27:09,987 --> 00:27:11,426
- Yes.
- Let us 3 try for a 3-pointer.

750
00:27:11,427 --> 00:27:12,657
Let's try it.

751
00:27:12,927 --> 00:27:14,456
In 1, 2, 3.

752
00:27:14,457 --> 00:27:15,597
- Let's do this!
- Here we go!

753
00:27:15,797 --> 00:27:16,867
Good luck!

754
00:27:17,067 --> 00:27:19,167
- Good luck!
- You can do it!

755
00:27:19,597 --> 00:27:21,237
- One.
- Relax.

756
00:27:21,567 --> 00:27:24,106
- Aim for the backboard's rectangle.
- Rectangle.

757
00:27:24,107 --> 00:27:25,777
(Aim for the backboard's rectangle.)

758
00:27:26,807 --> 00:27:28,207
(Free throw, 1 point)

759
00:27:28,377 --> 00:27:29,607
It'll go in.

760
00:27:30,577 --> 00:27:32,846
(Player 1, Ye Jin: No goal)

761
00:27:32,847 --> 00:27:34,776
- Oh, no.
- It's okay.

762
00:27:34,777 --> 00:27:35,847
- Oh, no.
- Then...

763
00:27:36,847 --> 00:27:38,386
If 1 gets 3 points, it's over, right?

764
00:27:38,387 --> 00:27:40,187
- Yes, from here on out.
- Three points.

765
00:27:40,357 --> 00:27:41,556
(Yeon Seok)

766
00:27:41,557 --> 00:27:42,557
Good luck!

767
00:27:42,558 --> 00:27:44,326
- Good luck!
- This isn't easy.

768
00:27:44,327 --> 00:27:45,427
(Yeon Seok goes straight for 3 points.)

769
00:27:46,227 --> 00:27:47,297
It's a hard one.

770
00:27:54,667 --> 00:27:57,667
(Will they succeed in Round 1 right away?)

771
00:28:03,447 --> 00:28:06,147
(That didn't go in?)

772
00:28:09,987 --> 00:28:11,787
- What a bummer.
- That was so close.

773
00:28:12,087 --> 00:28:14,086
- It almost went it.
- I thought it'd go in.

774
00:28:14,087 --> 00:28:15,387
(Out after hitting the rim twice)

775
00:28:16,187 --> 00:28:17,326
You can do it.

776
00:28:17,327 --> 00:28:19,227
(Next is Jae Suk, who scored a 3-pointer.)

777
00:28:19,297 --> 00:28:21,897
(In the posture he succeeded)

778
00:28:22,267 --> 00:28:23,466
What matters isn't the posture.

779
00:28:23,467 --> 00:28:24,927
- It's scoring.
- Of course not.

780
00:28:25,737 --> 00:28:26,897
Just like earlier.

781
00:28:27,567 --> 00:28:30,837
(Shoot as practiced, and he'll succeed!)

782
00:28:36,777 --> 00:28:40,277
(No goal after hitting the rim)

783
00:28:40,417 --> 00:28:41,447
Just a tad bit...

784
00:28:41,677 --> 00:28:43,386
- If only I had shot from here.
- Everyone hit the rim.

785
00:28:43,387 --> 00:28:44,447
Now Je Hoon.

786
00:28:44,817 --> 00:28:45,956
- He's here.
- Let's go.

787
00:28:45,957 --> 00:28:47,657
- The man is here.
- Let's do this.

788
00:28:47,817 --> 00:28:48,856
- Je Hoon.
- Lee Je Hoon.

789
00:28:48,857 --> 00:28:49,857
Je Hoon.

790
00:28:49,858 --> 00:28:51,726
- Lee Je Hoon.
- Just like when you practiced.

791
00:28:51,727 --> 00:28:53,456
- Good luck.
- Throw with confidence.

792
00:28:53,457 --> 00:28:55,667
(Show us what you've got, Kim Do Gi!)

793
00:28:57,327 --> 00:28:58,396
- He's running toward it.
- Right?

794
00:28:58,397 --> 00:28:59,997
It's going in.

795
00:29:03,867 --> 00:29:06,077
(All of the tries hit the rim and failed.)

796
00:29:06,277 --> 00:29:07,407
To think that didn't go in.

797
00:29:10,377 --> 00:29:11,677
Oh, no.

798
00:29:12,147 --> 00:29:13,646
Everyone hit the rim.

799
00:29:13,647 --> 00:29:15,817
(First try failed)

800
00:29:16,217 --> 00:29:17,387
If only he shoots from the chest.

801
00:29:17,747 --> 00:29:19,017
- Come.
- He shot from up here.

802
00:29:20,087 --> 00:29:21,357
Help us.

803
00:29:21,517 --> 00:29:23,226
- Go lower.
- We...

804
00:29:23,227 --> 00:29:24,556
- Bend lower.
- Lower?

805
00:29:24,557 --> 00:29:26,297
- Bend your knees.
- Throw it from below.

806
00:29:26,427 --> 00:29:27,556
We have to shoot from above.

807
00:29:27,557 --> 00:29:29,927
- No, below.
- From the chest.

808
00:29:30,097 --> 00:29:31,097
From the chest.

809
00:29:31,098 --> 00:29:32,396
From the chest?

810
00:29:32,397 --> 00:29:34,237
(Learned to shoot from the chest)

811
00:29:34,297 --> 00:29:36,067
- From below?
- Yes, the chest.

812
00:29:36,407 --> 00:29:37,507
The chest.

813
00:29:39,607 --> 00:29:41,937
- Okay.
- Okay.

814
00:29:42,477 --> 00:29:44,247
(The strategy to shoot from the chest works!)

815
00:29:44,447 --> 00:29:46,116
(Nickname: Messi in the practice world)

816
00:29:46,117 --> 00:29:47,846
- Next.
- From below. From the chest.

817
00:29:47,847 --> 00:29:49,786
- From below.
- From the chest.

818
00:29:49,787 --> 00:29:51,146
- Push up.
- From below.

819
00:29:51,147 --> 00:29:52,817
(Shooting from the chest has brought hope.)

820
00:29:55,017 --> 00:29:57,726
- Yes.
- It'll work.

821
00:29:57,727 --> 00:29:59,426
- How many points?
- Three.

822
00:29:59,427 --> 00:30:00,457
(Je Hoon tries a free throw.)

823
00:30:02,667 --> 00:30:03,797
(Success!)

824
00:30:03,927 --> 00:30:04,966
- Nice.
- He'll make it.

825
00:30:04,967 --> 00:30:06,036
- They'll make it.
- Good.

826
00:30:06,037 --> 00:30:07,467
(At this rate, they'll succeed in Round 1!)

827
00:30:07,667 --> 00:30:09,406
(Ye Jin also practices a free throw.)

828
00:30:09,407 --> 00:30:10,467
It's going in.

829
00:30:14,907 --> 00:30:17,006
(All four succeeded!)

830
00:30:17,007 --> 00:30:18,146
- For real?
- Now...

831
00:30:18,147 --> 00:30:19,677
- They've got the hang of it.
- Oh, my gosh.

832
00:30:20,877 --> 00:30:22,077
The next one...

833
00:30:22,747 --> 00:30:23,886
Let's go for one point, Ye Jin.

834
00:30:23,887 --> 00:30:25,716
- All right, let's call it.
- Here we go.

835
00:30:25,717 --> 00:30:27,316
- In 1, 2, 3.
- In 2, 3.

836
00:30:27,317 --> 00:30:28,586
- Let's do this!
- Let's do this!

837
00:30:28,587 --> 00:30:29,887
- Good luck.
- Good luck.

838
00:30:30,027 --> 00:30:32,397
Do I go 1st? I'll go 1st.

839
00:30:32,757 --> 00:30:36,027
The ball goes in once you get the hang of it.

840
00:30:37,567 --> 00:30:39,166
(They've got the hang of shooting the ball!)

841
00:30:39,167 --> 00:30:40,967
Okay, like this. Good.

842
00:30:41,167 --> 00:30:42,907
- Let's go.
- Relax.

843
00:30:49,877 --> 00:30:52,206
(A smooth score!)

844
00:30:52,207 --> 00:30:54,477
(Screaming)

845
00:30:55,547 --> 00:30:56,646
(Jumping out of happiness)

846
00:30:56,647 --> 00:30:57,786
(Got 1 point)

847
00:30:57,787 --> 00:30:59,817
- Nice.
- Good shot.

848
00:31:00,787 --> 00:31:02,686
Well done. Now then.

849
00:31:02,687 --> 00:31:03,886
(Second try, Yeon Seok: 1)

850
00:31:03,887 --> 00:31:05,026
Ye Jin next?

851
00:31:05,027 --> 00:31:06,326
- You go.
- Me?

852
00:31:06,327 --> 00:31:08,657
Je Hoon. Go ahead. Good luck.

853
00:31:10,067 --> 00:31:12,367
(Shooting right away?)

854
00:31:12,937 --> 00:31:13,997
It's going in.

855
00:31:16,307 --> 00:31:17,307
It's going in.

856
00:31:17,337 --> 00:31:18,737
(Scored)

857
00:31:19,737 --> 00:31:21,537
(Got another point)

858
00:31:21,737 --> 00:31:23,806
(All that's left to succeed Round 1...)

859
00:31:23,807 --> 00:31:27,216
(is a single point!)

860
00:31:27,217 --> 00:31:28,987
Hold on.

861
00:31:29,417 --> 00:31:32,217
- Oh, no.
- Hold on a moment.

862
00:31:32,357 --> 00:31:35,087
- This time, Ye Jin should...
- I'll go.

863
00:31:35,117 --> 00:31:36,256
I'll go, and you go last.

864
00:31:36,257 --> 00:31:37,327
Me?

865
00:31:39,057 --> 00:31:41,526
- Let's end it, Ye Jin.
- Ye Jin.

866
00:31:41,527 --> 00:31:42,727
(Let's end it here, Ye Jin.)

867
00:31:43,067 --> 00:31:44,266
- Have confidence.
- Let's do this.

868
00:31:44,267 --> 00:31:45,267
Good luck.

869
00:31:50,307 --> 00:31:51,407
(No goal)

870
00:31:52,007 --> 00:31:53,136
It's going in.

871
00:31:53,137 --> 00:31:54,376
(Second try, Yeon Seok: 1, Je Hoon: 1)

872
00:31:54,377 --> 00:31:57,846
- It's okay. The last try.
- Please.

873
00:31:57,847 --> 00:32:00,077
(Jae Suk is the only one to trust now.)

874
00:32:00,847 --> 00:32:02,216
- Here he is!
- Please.

875
00:32:02,217 --> 00:32:03,446
- Here he is!
- Here he is!

876
00:32:03,447 --> 00:32:06,287
- Yoo Jae Suk!
- Yoo Jae Suk!

877
00:32:07,087 --> 00:32:09,557
(Groaning)

878
00:32:10,327 --> 00:32:12,086
Guys, don't give him too much attention.

879
00:32:12,087 --> 00:32:13,857
- Don't give Jae Suk attention.
- We'll look away.

880
00:32:14,157 --> 00:32:15,867
(Looking elsewhere to help with the game jitters)

881
00:32:19,137 --> 00:32:20,197
Here he goes.

882
00:32:21,297 --> 00:32:22,337
- It's going in.
- It's going in.

883
00:32:38,405 --> 00:32:41,065
(Groaning)

884
00:32:44,275 --> 00:32:45,345
Oh, no.

885
00:32:47,145 --> 00:32:48,314
(Second try failed)

886
00:32:48,315 --> 00:32:49,645
For goodness' sake.

887
00:32:51,015 --> 00:32:52,185
The game jitters.

888
00:32:53,315 --> 00:32:54,514
- What now?
- It's too hard.

889
00:32:54,515 --> 00:32:55,754
Hold on. How many tries was that?

890
00:32:55,755 --> 00:32:56,785
- Fourth.
- Wait.

891
00:32:57,355 --> 00:32:58,825
- We have the bonus coupon.
- Right.

892
00:32:59,484 --> 00:33:01,514
But we only have one, Jae Suk. Using it...

893
00:33:01,954 --> 00:33:05,354
We should pass Round One ourselves...

894
00:33:05,724 --> 00:33:07,724
- and use it in Round Two, Jae Suk.
- Yes, you're right.

895
00:33:08,194 --> 00:33:10,554
- This is too hard.
- Isn't it too challenging for them?

896
00:33:10,624 --> 00:33:12,193
- How about we do a cheer?
- Let's cheer.

897
00:33:12,194 --> 00:33:13,494
- Come. Hurry.
- Let's do this.

898
00:33:13,624 --> 00:33:15,493
- We have to succeed this time.
- Good luck.

899
00:33:15,494 --> 00:33:17,293
- In 1, 2, 3.
- In 1, 2, 3.

900
00:33:17,294 --> 00:33:18,663
- Good luck!
- Good luck!

901
00:33:18,664 --> 00:33:19,833
- Let's go.
- Gosh.

902
00:33:19,834 --> 00:33:21,003
(They have 7 tries left.)

903
00:33:21,004 --> 00:33:22,303
We must succeed this time.

904
00:33:22,304 --> 00:33:23,904
We have to succeed now.

905
00:33:24,804 --> 00:33:25,874
Here I go.

906
00:33:26,074 --> 00:33:28,513
Now then, Round Four. Here we go.

907
00:33:28,514 --> 00:33:29,873
In 1, 2, 3.

908
00:33:29,874 --> 00:33:31,043
- Here we go!
- Good luck!

909
00:33:31,044 --> 00:33:32,743
- Good luck!
- Good luck!

910
00:33:32,744 --> 00:33:33,813
I'm getting nervous.

911
00:33:33,814 --> 00:33:34,814
(Out of 10 total tries, they're on try number 4.)

912
00:33:34,815 --> 00:33:35,914
Gosh.

913
00:33:50,664 --> 00:33:52,004
- Yes!
- Yes!

914
00:33:54,310 --> 00:33:55,720
(Scored 3 points!)

915
00:33:56,350 --> 00:33:57,650
All right!

916
00:33:58,850 --> 00:34:01,760
(Scored 3 points in 1 go!)

917
00:34:02,190 --> 00:34:03,790
(Screaming)

918
00:34:03,860 --> 00:34:05,659
(Rushing over)

919
00:34:05,660 --> 00:34:06,789
Okay!

920
00:34:06,790 --> 00:34:08,190
(Guys!)

921
00:34:08,430 --> 00:34:11,570
(The model shooter did it!)

922
00:34:15,940 --> 00:34:17,139
(He threw the ball ever so lightly,)

923
00:34:17,140 --> 00:34:19,110
(and it went in!)

924
00:34:20,440 --> 00:34:25,310
(Even Curry would be surprised by Je Hoon's accurate shooting.)

925
00:34:26,010 --> 00:34:28,979
(A reaction more intense...)

926
00:34:28,980 --> 00:34:33,790
(than winning the national championship)

927
00:34:34,320 --> 00:34:36,620
(Thrilled)

928
00:34:38,630 --> 00:34:39,829
Did you see that?

929
00:34:39,830 --> 00:34:42,730
- Succeeded Round One!
- Where do we go?

930
00:34:43,630 --> 00:34:44,829
(Shocked)

931
00:34:44,830 --> 00:34:47,330
It's thanks to the players' cheering.

932
00:34:48,200 --> 00:34:50,099
- Okay.
- Kim Do Gi!

933
00:34:50,100 --> 00:34:51,869
- Shout out his name.
- Kim Do Gi!

934
00:34:51,870 --> 00:34:53,570
- Shout out his name.
- Kim Do Gi!

935
00:34:53,740 --> 00:34:56,379
- Kim Do Gi succeeded.
- Our dear Kim Do Gi.

936
00:34:56,380 --> 00:35:00,050
- Really, Je Hoon...
- Yes, he did it.

937
00:35:00,550 --> 00:35:04,019
With that, we've succeeded Round One.

938
00:35:04,020 --> 00:35:05,119
- Success.
- Yes.

939
00:35:05,120 --> 00:35:06,220
(Secured the round-trip airfare to Jeju Island for 3)

940
00:35:06,290 --> 00:35:07,689
It's time to decide...

941
00:35:07,690 --> 00:35:09,120
- whether to go or stop.
- Go.

942
00:35:09,320 --> 00:35:11,120
Do you want to do Round Two?

943
00:35:11,390 --> 00:35:12,529
The bonus coupon...

944
00:35:12,530 --> 00:35:13,630
- has yet to be used.
- We saved it.

945
00:35:13,930 --> 00:35:17,200
- Exactly.
- Now then, decide.

946
00:35:17,300 --> 00:35:19,369
Go or stop? In 1, 2, 3.

947
00:35:19,370 --> 00:35:20,599
(What will Si Hoo decide?)

948
00:35:20,600 --> 00:35:21,940
- Go.
- Okay.

949
00:35:22,300 --> 00:35:23,399
It'll be okay.

950
00:35:23,400 --> 00:35:25,709
- Let's do this.
- Round Two.

951
00:35:25,710 --> 00:35:27,570
- I'm exploding with dopamine.
- Right?

952
00:35:29,780 --> 00:35:30,880
- What is it?
- For real?

953
00:35:31,010 --> 00:35:32,949
"Gen Z athletes' top choice,"

954
00:35:32,950 --> 00:35:34,079
"Under Armour puffer jackets."

955
00:35:34,080 --> 00:35:35,380
(Round 2 prize: Under Armour puffer jackets for the team)

956
00:35:36,420 --> 00:35:37,550
- Nice.
- Good one.

957
00:35:39,020 --> 00:35:40,249
(An upgraded prize befitting Round 2)

958
00:35:40,250 --> 00:35:41,890
- Don't open it yet.
- Don't?

959
00:35:42,560 --> 00:35:43,689
(Under Armour puffer jackets)

960
00:35:43,690 --> 00:35:44,990
You need a long puffer jacket in winter.

961
00:35:45,930 --> 00:35:47,429
(Round 2)

962
00:35:47,430 --> 00:35:50,300
(Target score: 4 points)

963
00:35:51,330 --> 00:35:52,400
Four points?

964
00:35:53,070 --> 00:35:54,530
- That's one more point.
- Four points?

965
00:35:54,630 --> 00:35:55,840
- What?
- That's just one more point.

966
00:35:55,900 --> 00:35:57,470
In 1, 2, 3.

967
00:35:57,600 --> 00:35:58,709
- Here we go!
- Here we go!

968
00:35:58,710 --> 00:36:01,369
(Out of 10 total tries, they're on try number 5.)

969
00:36:01,370 --> 00:36:02,440
Me first?

970
00:36:04,140 --> 00:36:05,679
- I want to score once.
- Good luck.

971
00:36:05,680 --> 00:36:06,810
Just once is enough.

972
00:36:06,950 --> 00:36:08,720
- The rectangle.
- The rectangle.

973
00:36:11,520 --> 00:36:13,220
(No goal)

974
00:36:13,650 --> 00:36:14,849
(Disappointed)

975
00:36:14,850 --> 00:36:17,090
- I thought it was going to go in.
- Same here.

976
00:36:17,260 --> 00:36:18,690
Well done.

977
00:36:20,160 --> 00:36:21,260
It's a huge bummer.

978
00:36:22,000 --> 00:36:24,929
Grasshopper. Let's go, Grasshopper.

979
00:36:24,930 --> 00:36:25,930
(Show us the Grasshopper shot!)

980
00:36:26,230 --> 00:36:27,300
From below.

981
00:36:28,400 --> 00:36:29,540
It's going in.

982
00:36:33,440 --> 00:36:34,670
(A clean shot)

983
00:36:35,340 --> 00:36:36,479
That's it.

984
00:36:36,480 --> 00:36:37,609
(Jae Suk successfully got 1 point!)

985
00:36:37,610 --> 00:36:40,080
Nice. Three points left.

986
00:36:40,680 --> 00:36:42,820
- Three points.
- Three points.

987
00:36:43,450 --> 00:36:45,419
- Three more points.
- It went as planned.

988
00:36:45,420 --> 00:36:46,490
- Then...
- Here.

989
00:36:47,050 --> 00:36:48,820
- Three points.
- As planned.

990
00:36:49,360 --> 00:36:50,389
- I'll go first.
- Okay.

991
00:36:50,390 --> 00:36:51,489
Get it in one shot!

992
00:36:51,490 --> 00:36:52,989
- He's here.
- It'll definitely go in.

993
00:36:52,990 --> 00:36:54,089
It'll go in for sure.

994
00:36:54,090 --> 00:36:55,659
- Je Hoon, let's end it.
- Here I go.

995
00:36:55,660 --> 00:36:56,830
Good luck.

996
00:36:58,160 --> 00:36:59,270
Je Hoon.

997
00:37:00,900 --> 00:37:02,500
Je Hoon.

998
00:37:03,300 --> 00:37:06,510
(Je Hoon, let's end it.)

999
00:37:08,680 --> 00:37:10,380
(No goal)

1000
00:37:10,740 --> 00:37:11,810
Je Hoon.

1001
00:37:11,880 --> 00:37:12,880
(Disappointed)

1002
00:37:13,410 --> 00:37:15,280
- It almost went in.
- What a shame.

1003
00:37:15,780 --> 00:37:17,320
- It's okay.
- We leave it to you, Yeon Seok.

1004
00:37:17,880 --> 00:37:18,989
It's okay.

1005
00:37:18,990 --> 00:37:20,689
(Yeon Seok is the last hope.)

1006
00:37:20,690 --> 00:37:23,259
- Good luck.
- Good luck!

1007
00:37:23,260 --> 00:37:24,260
(Second try, Yeon Seok)

1008
00:37:24,261 --> 00:37:25,389
The great actor.

1009
00:37:25,390 --> 00:37:27,529
(Second try, Ye Jin: 0, Jae Suk: 1, Je Hoon: 0)

1010
00:37:27,530 --> 00:37:30,530
- The left hand only assists, right?
- Yes.

1011
00:37:31,730 --> 00:37:34,199
(The moment where Yeon Seok's shot is needed)

1012
00:37:34,200 --> 00:37:35,240
Shoot as you did earlier.

1013
00:37:35,900 --> 00:37:37,870
It's going in.

1014
00:37:37,940 --> 00:37:39,740
The left hand only assists, right?

1015
00:37:42,810 --> 00:37:44,410
(Groaning)

1016
00:37:45,080 --> 00:37:46,110
It's going in.

1017
00:37:47,210 --> 00:37:48,310
How come?

1018
00:37:48,850 --> 00:37:50,050
That was close.

1019
00:37:50,580 --> 00:37:51,789
- It's okay. They can do it.
- If he switches hands...

1020
00:37:51,790 --> 00:37:52,850
- Oh, no.
- Gosh.

1021
00:37:54,320 --> 00:37:56,119
If they fail, are we not even getting...

1022
00:37:56,120 --> 00:37:57,460
- the Round One prize?
- No.

1023
00:37:57,520 --> 00:37:58,590
Then...

1024
00:37:58,860 --> 00:38:02,160
If there aren't many tries left, it's best to stop in Round Two.

1025
00:38:02,930 --> 00:38:05,329
- Okay.
- Now then, our seventh try.

1026
00:38:05,330 --> 00:38:06,699
- Let's do it.
- Here they go.

1027
00:38:06,700 --> 00:38:09,140
- In 1, 2, 3. Let's do it!
- In 1, 2, 3. Let's do it!

1028
00:38:09,440 --> 00:38:10,540
Let's go!

1029
00:38:10,770 --> 00:38:12,110
- Ye Jin.
- Me?

1030
00:38:12,610 --> 00:38:13,669
The rectangle, just like earlier.

1031
00:38:13,670 --> 00:38:15,239
- The rectangle.
- Hit the rectangle.

1032
00:38:15,240 --> 00:38:16,240
(First, Ye Jin aims for 1 point.)

1033
00:38:16,580 --> 00:38:17,680
High.

1034
00:38:18,010 --> 00:38:19,050
The rectangle.

1035
00:38:20,810 --> 00:38:21,880
She'll make it.

1036
00:38:22,020 --> 00:38:23,279
(No goal!)

1037
00:38:23,280 --> 00:38:26,749
(Seventh try, Ye Jin: 0)

1038
00:38:26,750 --> 00:38:28,489
- She was so close.
- I'll try three points.

1039
00:38:28,490 --> 00:38:29,619
- Three points first.
- Three points.

1040
00:38:29,620 --> 00:38:30,690
(Seventh try, Yeon Seok)

1041
00:38:31,160 --> 00:38:32,729
Let's go. Three points.

1042
00:38:32,730 --> 00:38:34,260
Please.

1043
00:38:35,330 --> 00:38:36,760
Starting with three points is a good idea.

1044
00:38:37,860 --> 00:38:38,930
That's it.

1045
00:38:42,170 --> 00:38:43,240
That's it.

1046
00:38:46,040 --> 00:38:47,869
(Scored a 3-pointer)

1047
00:38:47,870 --> 00:38:49,040
Okay!

1048
00:38:51,740 --> 00:38:52,750
(Screaming)

1049
00:38:53,110 --> 00:38:55,320
(Rushing over again)

1050
00:38:55,850 --> 00:38:56,919
Well done.

1051
00:38:56,920 --> 00:38:58,150
- Nice.
- Good job.

1052
00:38:58,720 --> 00:38:59,790
As expected.

1053
00:39:00,720 --> 00:39:01,860
- You're the best.
- Now then...

1054
00:39:02,020 --> 00:39:03,889
One point.

1055
00:39:03,890 --> 00:39:06,330
- Is there only 1 point left?
- They only have 1 point left.

1056
00:39:06,430 --> 00:39:08,090
- We have to get one more point.
- One point.

1057
00:39:08,190 --> 00:39:09,759
- One point from either of you two.
- There's no pressure.

1058
00:39:09,760 --> 00:39:10,860
Right.

1059
00:39:11,760 --> 00:39:12,830
Okay.

1060
00:39:13,000 --> 00:39:14,070
Good luck!

1061
00:39:14,570 --> 00:39:16,139
- Let's go!
- Let's go!

1062
00:39:16,140 --> 00:39:17,200
Let's go!

1063
00:39:18,870 --> 00:39:20,510
We'll make it to Round Three.

1064
00:39:21,740 --> 00:39:22,840
It's going in.

1065
00:39:27,350 --> 00:39:28,380
It's going in.

1066
00:39:33,790 --> 00:39:35,290
(No goal!)

1067
00:39:35,790 --> 00:39:38,089
(Shutting his eyes)

1068
00:39:38,090 --> 00:39:40,829
(Seventh try, Ye Jin: 0, Yeon Seok: 3, Je Hoon: 0)

1069
00:39:40,830 --> 00:39:44,029
(Seventh try, Jae Suk)

1070
00:39:44,030 --> 00:39:45,200
- Jae Suk...
- Jae Suk...

1071
00:39:45,570 --> 00:39:46,730
- Get over your jitters!
- Don't give up.

1072
00:39:46,930 --> 00:39:48,199
- Grasshopper.
- You must get over it!

1073
00:39:48,200 --> 00:39:50,069
- You must get over it!
- You must get over it!

1074
00:39:50,070 --> 00:39:51,070
(Everyone is cheering.)

1075
00:39:51,340 --> 00:39:53,370
(Laughing)

1076
00:39:54,210 --> 00:39:55,379
You must get over it.

1077
00:39:55,380 --> 00:39:56,409
(We believe in you, Almighty Yoo.)

1078
00:39:56,410 --> 00:39:57,440
Good luck!

1079
00:39:58,750 --> 00:40:00,810
(The basketball is in the way.)

1080
00:40:03,250 --> 00:40:04,250
(The Grasshopper shooter is unnecessarily sensitive.)

1081
00:40:04,251 --> 00:40:05,349
This is...

1082
00:40:05,350 --> 00:40:06,890
(Laughing)

1083
00:40:07,190 --> 00:40:09,920
(The expectation has hit the maximum.)

1084
00:40:11,060 --> 00:40:12,130
I'm ready to rush over.

1085
00:40:14,690 --> 00:40:17,760
(Getting ready to run out)

1086
00:40:19,670 --> 00:40:20,730
Oh, no.

1087
00:40:21,370 --> 00:40:22,800
(Failed)

1088
00:40:23,700 --> 00:40:24,769
Oh, no.

1089
00:40:24,770 --> 00:40:27,870
(Oh, no...)

1090
00:40:28,240 --> 00:40:29,310
Oh, no.

1091
00:40:30,940 --> 00:40:33,250
(Dropped down)

1092
00:40:34,150 --> 00:40:36,520
(The cheering squad disbands.)

1093
00:40:36,880 --> 00:40:39,390
(My head hurts.)

1094
00:40:40,290 --> 00:40:41,789
The extreme pressure...

1095
00:40:41,790 --> 00:40:42,859
Come on, Jae Suk.

1096
00:40:42,860 --> 00:40:44,660
(Jae Suk's chronic disease came back to haunt him.)

1097
00:40:45,590 --> 00:40:46,760
Come on, Jae Suk.

1098
00:40:47,860 --> 00:40:50,059
- Let's use the bonus coupon.
- We need to use it.

1099
00:40:50,060 --> 00:40:51,729
We'll use the bonus coupon.

1100
00:40:51,730 --> 00:40:53,570
- We'll use the bonus coupon.
- We'll use it.

1101
00:40:54,070 --> 00:40:55,539
We need Si Hoo's help.

1102
00:40:55,540 --> 00:40:57,499
- We can't do it.
- Let's go, Si Hoo.

1103
00:40:57,500 --> 00:40:58,540
Now then...

1104
00:40:58,670 --> 00:41:01,539
You need to replace one of us.

1105
00:41:01,540 --> 00:41:03,779
One among us four needs to step out.

1106
00:41:03,780 --> 00:41:04,780
I'll step out.

1107
00:41:05,650 --> 00:41:07,079
- It's a slump.
- No, I will.

1108
00:41:07,080 --> 00:41:09,449
- I'm in a slump.
- I can't even get one point.

1109
00:41:09,450 --> 00:41:11,350
- You should still try, Ye Jin.
- Si Hoo.

1110
00:41:11,750 --> 00:41:12,789
- I'll step out.
- Okay.

1111
00:41:12,790 --> 00:41:13,849
- Us three?
- Ye Jin should...

1112
00:41:13,850 --> 00:41:14,989
You three do it.

1113
00:41:14,990 --> 00:41:16,220
(Jae Suk out, Si Hoo in)

1114
00:41:16,460 --> 00:41:17,690
Si Hoo needs to go last.

1115
00:41:18,160 --> 00:41:20,060
- We three should shoot first.
- Yes.

1116
00:41:20,390 --> 00:41:22,500
- Si Hoo should go last.
- Okay.

1117
00:41:22,760 --> 00:41:24,460
Si Hoo can score the rest.

1118
00:41:25,100 --> 00:41:27,129
- In 1, 2, 3. Here we go!
- Here we go!

1119
00:41:27,130 --> 00:41:29,169
(Bonus coupon try)

1120
00:41:29,170 --> 00:41:30,570
It's the rectangle, okay?

1121
00:41:30,770 --> 00:41:31,899
The rectangle.

1122
00:41:31,900 --> 00:41:32,970
(Player 1, Ye Jin's free throw)

1123
00:41:36,610 --> 00:41:37,640
The rectangle.

1124
00:41:38,510 --> 00:41:39,880
(No goal)

1125
00:41:41,350 --> 00:41:43,049
(Bonus try, Ye Jin)

1126
00:41:43,050 --> 00:41:44,079
(It means bigger pressure for him.)

1127
00:41:44,080 --> 00:41:45,180
It's okay.

1128
00:41:45,520 --> 00:41:46,720
Three points or one point?

1129
00:41:47,050 --> 00:41:49,190
- I'll go for a three-pointer.
- Three-pointer.

1130
00:41:49,660 --> 00:41:50,860
Go for three points.

1131
00:41:51,190 --> 00:41:53,360
Then, he can only score one.

1132
00:41:58,500 --> 00:42:00,170
(No goal)

1133
00:42:01,070 --> 00:42:02,199
It's far off.

1134
00:42:02,200 --> 00:42:03,340
(Je Hoon got nervous and lost the touch.)

1135
00:42:04,640 --> 00:42:05,839
- One point.
- One point.

1136
00:42:05,840 --> 00:42:06,940
- One point.
- One point.

1137
00:42:08,840 --> 00:42:10,209
- Then, I'll go for one point.
- Okay.

1138
00:42:10,210 --> 00:42:11,640
Yeon Shik, go for one point.

1139
00:42:11,940 --> 00:42:14,510
- No!
- This is...

1140
00:42:14,880 --> 00:42:16,780
Shouldn't Si Hoo shoot a three-pointer first?

1141
00:42:17,880 --> 00:42:19,320
(What?)

1142
00:42:19,590 --> 00:42:21,920
- You...
- But if I go last...

1143
00:42:22,760 --> 00:42:24,489
- Even you couldn't make it.
- Do it.

1144
00:42:24,490 --> 00:42:25,729
Do it.

1145
00:42:25,730 --> 00:42:27,530
If I miss,

1146
00:42:28,190 --> 00:42:30,100
Si Hoo doesn't even get to shoot.

1147
00:42:31,030 --> 00:42:33,199
Yes, Si Hoo, you should score three.

1148
00:42:33,200 --> 00:42:34,230
Yes.

1149
00:42:35,270 --> 00:42:36,400
Good luck!

1150
00:42:36,570 --> 00:42:39,139
- That's fair.
- Yes.

1151
00:42:39,140 --> 00:42:40,170
Let's go!

1152
00:42:40,440 --> 00:42:42,510
You have to score, Si Hoo.

1153
00:42:42,840 --> 00:42:43,840
He has to score.

1154
00:42:43,841 --> 00:42:45,210
If he misses, he's not our shooter anymore.

1155
00:42:46,010 --> 00:42:47,710
It must be a lot of pressure on Si Hoo as well.

1156
00:42:49,380 --> 00:42:51,720
(This nervous boy...)

1157
00:42:52,020 --> 00:42:54,889
(makes 3-pointers whenever possible.)

1158
00:42:54,890 --> 00:42:58,590
(He's Jung Si Hoo, a senior in Kyungbock High School.)

1159
00:42:59,590 --> 00:43:02,729
How many three-pointers has Si Hoo made today?

1160
00:43:02,730 --> 00:43:03,730
(This is probably...)

1161
00:43:03,731 --> 00:43:06,430
(the most nerve-racking moment in his basketball life.)

1162
00:43:07,070 --> 00:43:08,070
(Ready to mock him if he misses)

1163
00:43:08,071 --> 00:43:10,070
- Let's do it.
- It's cold. I need a jacket.

1164
00:43:10,340 --> 00:43:11,500
(Looking forward to it)

1165
00:43:11,640 --> 00:43:13,170
(Looking forward to it as well)

1166
00:43:13,640 --> 00:43:15,310
(Not looking forward to it?)

1167
00:43:15,980 --> 00:43:18,340
(Player 3, Si Hoo's 3-pointer)

1168
00:43:30,941 --> 00:43:33,141
(A clean 3-pointer)

1169
00:43:36,011 --> 00:43:37,911
(Cheering)

1170
00:43:43,551 --> 00:43:44,580
That was so cool.

1171
00:43:44,581 --> 00:43:46,191
(How the championship team of the National Sports Festival plays)

1172
00:43:48,691 --> 00:43:51,760
(Bonus try, Si Hoo 3)

1173
00:43:51,761 --> 00:43:52,830
(Bonus try, Yeon Seok)

1174
00:43:52,831 --> 00:43:55,430
(And there's one man who can't smile at ease.)

1175
00:43:55,431 --> 00:43:57,101
- Si Hoo.
- I believe in you.

1176
00:43:58,001 --> 00:43:59,170
Si Hoo.

1177
00:43:59,171 --> 00:44:00,370
(This middle-aged man is proud of Si Hoo.)

1178
00:44:00,371 --> 00:44:01,630
It was so clean.

1179
00:44:01,631 --> 00:44:02,701
Jae Suk.

1180
00:44:03,241 --> 00:44:05,840
Si Hoo was going to score anyway.

1181
00:44:05,841 --> 00:44:07,210
Why did you have to make me go last?

1182
00:44:07,211 --> 00:44:08,440
It's just one point.

1183
00:44:08,441 --> 00:44:10,380
- You can do it. Give it a try.
- You've got this!

1184
00:44:10,381 --> 00:44:11,410
(You've got this, Yoo One Shot.)

1185
00:44:11,411 --> 00:44:12,510
Why do you say you can't make it?

1186
00:44:12,511 --> 00:44:14,680
- Well, I can make it.
- Go on.

1187
00:44:14,681 --> 00:44:15,980
(Yeon Seok must put an end to this dramatic story.)

1188
00:44:15,981 --> 00:44:17,121
Hold on.

1189
00:44:17,581 --> 00:44:19,091
Please.

1190
00:44:22,561 --> 00:44:24,061
(Praying hands)

1191
00:44:25,491 --> 00:44:27,491
- I just need to hit the backboard.
- Right.

1192
00:44:33,371 --> 00:44:34,971
I just need to hit the backboard.

1193
00:44:37,871 --> 00:44:39,471
(Please...)

1194
00:44:47,451 --> 00:44:50,051
(The coupon round is a failure.)

1195
00:45:11,071 --> 00:45:12,671
(Dumbfounded)

1196
00:45:14,771 --> 00:45:17,811
(The shocking ending of this action comic for boys)

1197
00:45:19,951 --> 00:45:20,981
Oh, gosh.

1198
00:45:21,281 --> 00:45:23,251
It's pretty tough.

1199
00:45:23,551 --> 00:45:26,251
- Going last...
- I told you I didn't want to.

1200
00:45:27,621 --> 00:45:28,721
Si Hoo could have...

1201
00:45:29,561 --> 00:45:31,520
Si Hoo could have gone after me.

1202
00:45:31,521 --> 00:45:33,890
- What do we do?
- We only have one try left.

1203
00:45:33,891 --> 00:45:35,531
(They have one last opportunity.)

1204
00:45:36,801 --> 00:45:39,831
(Acting abnormally due to stress)

1205
00:45:40,901 --> 00:45:42,771
- This is driving me crazy.
- Last chance?

1206
00:45:42,901 --> 00:45:44,341
- Yes.
- Let's do it.

1207
00:45:44,401 --> 00:45:45,540
We can score three here.

1208
00:45:45,541 --> 00:45:48,311
(Eventually, they're on their last try.)

1209
00:45:52,511 --> 00:45:54,881
(It weighs more heavily on them.)

1210
00:45:57,681 --> 00:45:59,591
We have one last chance left.

1211
00:45:59,791 --> 00:46:01,390
One last chance.

1212
00:46:01,391 --> 00:46:02,961
(It's not over yet.)

1213
00:46:03,661 --> 00:46:05,431
(It's okay!)

1214
00:46:05,591 --> 00:46:07,790
- Let's go!
- Let's go!

1215
00:46:07,791 --> 00:46:10,400
- Last chance.
- Last chance.

1216
00:46:10,401 --> 00:46:12,830
- In 1, 2, 3. Let's go!
- Let's go!

1217
00:46:12,831 --> 00:46:14,831
- Let's create miracles.
- It's our last chance.

1218
00:46:15,231 --> 00:46:16,271
We can do it.

1219
00:46:16,471 --> 00:46:18,070
- We can do this.
- Let's do it!

1220
00:46:18,071 --> 00:46:19,471
(Out of 10 total tries, they're on the last try.)

1221
00:46:19,611 --> 00:46:20,640
Last chance.

1222
00:46:20,641 --> 00:46:23,181
(Desperate)

1223
00:46:23,281 --> 00:46:25,380
Ye Jin, go first. One point.

1224
00:46:25,381 --> 00:46:26,410
I'll make it.

1225
00:46:26,411 --> 00:46:27,450
(Player 1, Ye Jin's free throw)

1226
00:46:27,451 --> 00:46:29,550
(Last try, Ye Jin)

1227
00:46:29,551 --> 00:46:30,750
She's got it.

1228
00:46:30,751 --> 00:46:31,780
(What?)

1229
00:46:31,781 --> 00:46:33,491
- She made it.
- She made it.

1230
00:46:34,591 --> 00:46:35,661
It's going in.

1231
00:46:38,991 --> 00:46:40,061
It's going in.

1232
00:46:43,831 --> 00:46:44,831
It's going in.

1233
00:46:46,701 --> 00:46:48,231
(Goal)

1234
00:46:49,671 --> 00:46:51,770
(Ye Jin has finally done it!)

1235
00:46:51,771 --> 00:46:53,170
She's got it.

1236
00:46:53,171 --> 00:46:55,171
(Madness)

1237
00:46:57,041 --> 00:46:58,241
- You did it.
- Yes!

1238
00:46:58,381 --> 00:46:59,910
- Well done.
- Please.

1239
00:46:59,911 --> 00:47:02,120
- Great job.
- Please make it.

1240
00:47:02,121 --> 00:47:05,081
(Ye Jin reignited the spark of hope.)

1241
00:47:05,751 --> 00:47:08,051
- You go first. No, I'll go first.
- What?

1242
00:47:09,191 --> 00:47:12,130
(Player 2, Jae Suk's 3-pointer)

1243
00:47:12,131 --> 00:47:13,131
(Last try, Jae Suk)

1244
00:47:13,132 --> 00:47:15,401
(One three-pointer, and it's over.)

1245
00:47:18,201 --> 00:47:19,401
(No goal)

1246
00:47:21,231 --> 00:47:22,500
(Last try, Jae Suk)

1247
00:47:22,501 --> 00:47:23,601
Just a little more.

1248
00:47:24,801 --> 00:47:26,470
(Player 3, Yeon Seok's 3-pointer)

1249
00:47:26,471 --> 00:47:27,541
Just a little further.

1250
00:47:28,571 --> 00:47:29,610
Let's go, Kyungbock High!

1251
00:47:29,611 --> 00:47:31,141
- Yes!
- Yes!

1252
00:47:35,081 --> 00:47:36,151
Throw it far.

1253
00:47:38,921 --> 00:47:42,220
(Can he...)

1254
00:47:42,221 --> 00:47:44,290
(make it?)

1255
00:47:44,291 --> 00:47:45,431
Let's create miracles.

1256
00:47:52,301 --> 00:47:53,370
(Last try, Yeon Seok)

1257
00:47:53,371 --> 00:47:55,540
(He missed by a hair.)

1258
00:47:55,541 --> 00:47:56,800
That was so good, though.

1259
00:47:56,801 --> 00:47:58,500
He missed by an inch.

1260
00:47:58,501 --> 00:47:59,510
It was so...

1261
00:47:59,511 --> 00:48:00,571
(Last try, Yeon Seok)

1262
00:48:01,541 --> 00:48:02,711
It was a good one, though.

1263
00:48:03,581 --> 00:48:05,211
All right. I'll make this one.

1264
00:48:05,311 --> 00:48:06,481
He must score.

1265
00:48:07,581 --> 00:48:08,651
Please.

1266
00:48:10,351 --> 00:48:11,980
Je Hoon, try it. No pressure.

1267
00:48:11,981 --> 00:48:13,351
- Good luck!
- No pressure.

1268
00:48:14,491 --> 00:48:16,721
(Today's last shot)

1269
00:48:17,061 --> 00:48:18,161
He's got it.

1270
00:48:19,861 --> 00:48:21,030
He's got it.

1271
00:48:21,031 --> 00:48:22,301
- What?
- Hey!

1272
00:48:23,531 --> 00:48:24,731
- What?
- Hey!

1273
00:48:25,901 --> 00:48:28,501
(The end)

1274
00:48:36,881 --> 00:48:39,451
(The whistle blows sadly.)

1275
00:48:50,891 --> 00:48:54,831
(They fail the first mission of the new season.)

1276
00:48:58,931 --> 00:49:01,971
(There was no miracle.)

1277
00:49:03,771 --> 00:49:05,040
- Wait.
- No.

1278
00:49:05,041 --> 00:49:07,010
(They take the flight tickets and jackets away.)

1279
00:49:07,011 --> 00:49:08,470
Guard, protect them.

1280
00:49:08,471 --> 00:49:10,040
- Guard!
- Hold on.

1281
00:49:10,041 --> 00:49:11,281
Just a second.

1282
00:49:12,351 --> 00:49:13,511
Why didn't they take this?

1283
00:49:15,181 --> 00:49:17,821
- It's so difficult, though.
- It is.

1284
00:49:18,951 --> 00:49:20,720
(Why did you go for it?)

1285
00:49:20,721 --> 00:49:22,990
- What should we do?
- This is tormenting...

1286
00:49:22,991 --> 00:49:24,490
early in the morning.

1287
00:49:24,491 --> 00:49:25,990
(They can't even look at the boys.)

1288
00:49:25,991 --> 00:49:27,890
- We should've stopped.
- They took those away...

1289
00:49:27,891 --> 00:49:29,301
so cold-heartedly.

1290
00:49:30,061 --> 00:49:32,801
- We...
- First off...

1291
00:49:33,601 --> 00:49:34,831
- Gosh.
- Gosh.

1292
00:49:35,801 --> 00:49:37,540
(The humble merch appears.)

1293
00:49:37,541 --> 00:49:38,801
Goodness.

1294
00:49:40,541 --> 00:49:43,110
We should have given them the puffer jackets.

1295
00:49:43,111 --> 00:49:45,651
- Right.
- We're sorry.

1296
00:49:46,381 --> 00:49:47,611
We're truly sorry.

1297
00:49:48,011 --> 00:49:49,921
- We apologize.
- We're sorry.

1298
00:49:50,151 --> 00:49:51,281
Oh, gosh.

1299
00:49:52,391 --> 00:49:53,550
This is better.

1300
00:49:53,551 --> 00:49:55,251
- I think these are better.
- Right.

1301
00:49:55,761 --> 00:49:57,820
These are our merch.

1302
00:49:57,821 --> 00:49:59,791
(Awkward)

1303
00:50:00,331 --> 00:50:01,660
We're sorry.

1304
00:50:01,661 --> 00:50:04,101
Don't. We did pretty well.

1305
00:50:04,531 --> 00:50:06,731
Earlier... Anyway...

1306
00:50:07,001 --> 00:50:09,800
Remember the jackets you took?

1307
00:50:09,801 --> 00:50:10,940
Please bring them here.

1308
00:50:10,941 --> 00:50:12,371
- Let me buy them for them.
- You can't.

1309
00:50:12,611 --> 00:50:13,871
- You can't.
- I can't?

1310
00:50:14,041 --> 00:50:15,680
- We can't even do that?
- It's not allowed.

1311
00:50:15,681 --> 00:50:16,681
Why not?

1312
00:50:17,281 --> 00:50:18,880
I'm spending my money.

1313
00:50:18,881 --> 00:50:21,111
- We're not allowed to do that.
- This is so harsh.

1314
00:50:21,251 --> 00:50:23,551
- I know how you feel, but we can't.
- Well, then...

1315
00:50:23,881 --> 00:50:25,480
I know how you feel, but we're not allowed to do that too.

1316
00:50:25,481 --> 00:50:27,120
(How was shooting Whenever Possible today?)

1317
00:50:27,121 --> 00:50:30,061
I won't get to see my juniors next year,

1318
00:50:31,091 --> 00:50:33,960
so it was nice to have something to remember...

1319
00:50:33,961 --> 00:50:35,331
through this show.

1320
00:50:35,531 --> 00:50:37,731
I wish I could hang out with them like this again...

1321
00:50:37,801 --> 00:50:39,801
even when I'm in college.

1322
00:50:40,671 --> 00:50:43,841
- Whenever Possible!
- Whenever Possible!

1323
00:50:47,311 --> 00:50:50,481
We'll be going, then.

1324
00:50:51,181 --> 00:50:52,950
- Sorry.
- We're sorry.

1325
00:50:52,951 --> 00:50:54,350
- Good work today.
- Should we...

1326
00:50:54,351 --> 00:50:55,850
ask them to recommend a place for lunch?

1327
00:50:55,851 --> 00:50:57,280
- Are you serious?
- No?

1328
00:50:57,281 --> 00:50:58,350
(Navi Yoo is way too committed to his job.)

1329
00:50:58,351 --> 00:51:00,390
You want to ask them to recommend us lunch in this situation?

1330
00:51:00,391 --> 00:51:02,520
We could, though.

1331
00:51:02,521 --> 00:51:04,460
- The students... Should we?
- Just quietly leave today.

1332
00:51:04,461 --> 00:51:05,790
- We should leave quietly.
- It was a thought in my head.

1333
00:51:05,791 --> 00:51:07,331
Just leave quietly today.

1334
00:51:07,691 --> 00:51:09,560
We'll be going, Si Hoo.

1335
00:51:09,561 --> 00:51:10,700
- Bye!
- Bye.

1336
00:51:10,701 --> 00:51:11,930
- Thanks for today.
- Bye.

1337
00:51:11,931 --> 00:51:13,331
- Good luck, guys.
- Thanks.

1338
00:51:13,731 --> 00:51:15,330
I can't believe we missed.

1339
00:51:15,331 --> 00:51:18,040
- I feel so bad.
- It's tough.

1340
00:51:18,041 --> 00:51:21,340
- The pressure of going last...
- Yes, the pressure.

1341
00:51:21,341 --> 00:51:22,510
- It was impossible.
- Gosh.

1342
00:51:22,511 --> 00:51:23,711
I can never make it when I'm going last.

1343
00:51:23,881 --> 00:51:27,450
We were sad every time we failed,

1344
00:51:27,451 --> 00:51:29,280
but the air was the coldest...

1345
00:51:29,281 --> 00:51:30,821
after Si Hoo scored.

1346
00:51:32,891 --> 00:51:34,790
You also missed all the shots when you went last.

1347
00:51:34,791 --> 00:51:37,560
But when you missed,

1348
00:51:37,561 --> 00:51:39,591
the boys were so disappointed that they turned around.

1349
00:51:39,861 --> 00:51:41,990
(They all cut him off.)

1350
00:51:41,991 --> 00:51:43,361
They did.

1351
00:51:46,071 --> 00:51:47,430
- Nothing's easy.
- No.

1352
00:51:47,431 --> 00:51:48,600
Let's just go.

1353
00:51:48,601 --> 00:51:50,040
The next one is at 12pm, so we have some time.

1354
00:51:50,041 --> 00:51:51,670
- We should eat.
- Yes.

1355
00:51:51,671 --> 00:51:53,341
Then, one of the options is...

1356
00:51:54,241 --> 00:51:56,311
- to eat here.
- Yes.

1357
00:51:56,481 --> 00:51:59,280
Let's check out a good restaurant nearby.

1358
00:51:59,281 --> 00:52:00,681
- Sure.
- That's a first.

1359
00:52:00,851 --> 00:52:02,050
- Let's check it out.
- Yes.

1360
00:52:02,051 --> 00:52:04,780
Ye Jin and Je Hoon came all this way from Sinan.

1361
00:52:04,781 --> 00:52:06,991
- They came from Sinan.
- Right.

1362
00:52:10,591 --> 00:52:12,530
It's really depressing.

1363
00:52:12,531 --> 00:52:13,930
- You feel dispirited, right?
- Yes.

1364
00:52:13,931 --> 00:52:15,260
- I'm like, "Is this all right?"
- It makes you walk like this.

1365
00:52:15,261 --> 00:52:16,460
- You trudge.
- Right.

1366
00:52:16,461 --> 00:52:18,901
I don't exactly have an appetite right now.

1367
00:52:19,371 --> 00:52:20,730
- You lost your appetite.
- Yes.

1368
00:52:20,731 --> 00:52:22,341
Our appetite...

1369
00:52:23,241 --> 00:52:24,670
I never knew...

1370
00:52:24,671 --> 00:52:26,710
we'd shoot basketballs on the basketball court.

1371
00:52:26,711 --> 00:52:28,070
- Right.
- They normally...

1372
00:52:28,071 --> 00:52:30,880
- give us an unrelated game.
- We normally get silly games.

1373
00:52:30,881 --> 00:52:33,180
They can't get serious and make us shoot now.

1374
00:52:33,181 --> 00:52:35,010
- Right.
- Yes. It was too harsh this time.

1375
00:52:35,011 --> 00:52:36,180
It was so difficult.

1376
00:52:36,181 --> 00:52:38,180
Like when Seo Jin was here, we could have played weird games.

1377
00:52:38,181 --> 00:52:39,390
- Right.
- But...

1378
00:52:39,391 --> 00:52:41,120
- You know, riding weird stuff.
- That's doable.

1379
00:52:41,121 --> 00:52:43,160
You know, there are small basketball stands.

1380
00:52:43,161 --> 00:52:44,190
- Exactly.
- We could have done that.

1381
00:52:44,191 --> 00:52:46,061
I was expecting something like that as well.

1382
00:52:46,231 --> 00:52:48,561
They can't get all serious and make us shoot basketballs.

1383
00:52:48,591 --> 00:52:50,200
We're not even basketball players.

1384
00:52:50,201 --> 00:52:51,230
- Right.
- Tell me about it.

1385
00:52:51,231 --> 00:52:52,400
And there were no two-pointers.

1386
00:52:52,401 --> 00:52:53,700
There are two-pointers in basketball.

1387
00:52:53,701 --> 00:52:54,900
(They started complaining non-stop.)

1388
00:52:54,901 --> 00:52:57,301
This is so discouraging.

1389
00:52:57,401 --> 00:52:59,240
Earlier, I felt...

1390
00:52:59,241 --> 00:53:02,070
so much energy and a strong dopamine rush.

1391
00:53:02,071 --> 00:53:03,110
They were so happy earlier.

1392
00:53:03,111 --> 00:53:04,710
They all gasped when they saw the jackets.

1393
00:53:04,711 --> 00:53:06,410
This feeling of defeat...

1394
00:53:06,411 --> 00:53:07,950
I was dying to make it work.

1395
00:53:07,951 --> 00:53:09,721
When we passed Round One, I felt like I was...

1396
00:53:09,821 --> 00:53:11,581
- on top of the world.
- Yes, he made that three-pointer.

1397
00:53:11,651 --> 00:53:13,920
The pressure was bigger in Round Two...

1398
00:53:13,921 --> 00:53:15,620
Come to think of it, we've been talking...

1399
00:53:15,621 --> 00:53:17,121
about how disappointed we are for 20 minutes.

1400
00:53:17,361 --> 00:53:18,661
- It was too...
- Let's stop now.

1401
00:53:18,861 --> 00:53:20,831
- We have...
- Should we stop?

1402
00:53:21,031 --> 00:53:22,430
the next client waiting.

1403
00:53:22,431 --> 00:53:24,401
We should stop so that we won't be affected.

1404
00:53:25,161 --> 00:53:26,500
- We must succeed next.
- We must.

1405
00:53:26,501 --> 00:53:27,570
- Now...
- There are...

1406
00:53:27,571 --> 00:53:29,270
- two Korean restaurants.
- Should we check it out?

1407
00:53:29,271 --> 00:53:32,370
Pick between a bossam place and a cheonggukjang place.

1408
00:53:32,371 --> 00:53:33,410
- Okay.
- Sure.

1409
00:53:33,411 --> 00:53:35,240
Or there's a Chinese restaurant.

1410
00:53:35,241 --> 00:53:37,340
- Where?
- That old place.

1411
00:53:37,341 --> 00:53:38,341
Should we go there?

1412
00:53:38,342 --> 00:53:39,850
It's morning, and people are waiting in line.

1413
00:53:39,851 --> 00:53:41,280
They are waiting in line early in the morning.

1414
00:53:41,281 --> 00:53:42,850
- Why don't we...
- Should we join them?

1415
00:53:42,851 --> 00:53:44,280
- We can cross there.
- Should we?

1416
00:53:44,281 --> 00:53:45,791
We can cross over there.

1417
00:53:46,421 --> 00:53:48,190
Let's go to a place where people wait.

1418
00:53:48,191 --> 00:53:50,291
- Yes.
- What made you change your mind?

1419
00:53:50,491 --> 00:53:52,261
Normally, he never waits.

1420
00:53:52,761 --> 00:53:54,360
Are you trying to feel better by eating good food?

1421
00:53:54,361 --> 00:53:55,460
That's right.

1422
00:53:55,461 --> 00:53:57,701
I'll eat spicy jjamppong...

1423
00:53:57,831 --> 00:53:59,200
and feel stronger.

1424
00:53:59,201 --> 00:54:00,701
He likes noodles.

1425
00:54:01,301 --> 00:54:03,640
The younger ones get the lead.

1426
00:54:03,641 --> 00:54:04,671
- Right.
- Yes.

1427
00:54:05,041 --> 00:54:06,241
This place has an aura.

1428
00:54:06,471 --> 00:54:07,740
- This is...
- It looks like a good one.

1429
00:54:07,741 --> 00:54:09,680
(The appearance is approved.)

1430
00:54:09,681 --> 00:54:10,910
There were lots of good reviews.

1431
00:54:10,911 --> 00:54:12,481
People are already waiting.

1432
00:54:14,081 --> 00:54:15,251
Oh, this...

1433
00:54:15,551 --> 00:54:17,381
- The teacher!
- It was right nearby.

1434
00:54:17,981 --> 00:54:19,490
(Next to the Chinese restaurant,)

1435
00:54:19,491 --> 00:54:22,761
(there's a familiar alley?)

1436
00:54:24,261 --> 00:54:25,860
The piano teacher in the first episode.

1437
00:54:25,861 --> 00:54:27,591
- Really?
- Hold on.

1438
00:54:28,731 --> 00:54:31,231
(It was March, 2024.)

1439
00:54:31,631 --> 00:54:33,671
(The very first episode of Whenever Possible)

1440
00:54:33,971 --> 00:54:36,501
(The Chinese restaurant that they just saw)

1441
00:54:36,801 --> 00:54:39,571
(The alley they came to with Lee Kwang Soo)

1442
00:54:39,911 --> 00:54:41,441
- Hello.
- Hello.

1443
00:54:42,241 --> 00:54:45,311
(Where the piano teacher, who wanted to talk to adults, was)

1444
00:54:46,081 --> 00:54:47,351
- Oh, this...
- Oh, right!

1445
00:54:47,481 --> 00:54:50,221
(They clearly remember her.)

1446
00:54:52,351 --> 00:54:53,650
Are you trying to see if she's there?

1447
00:54:53,651 --> 00:54:54,890
(We're on our way.)

1448
00:54:54,891 --> 00:54:57,491
- Is she here?
- We once visited...

1449
00:54:57,591 --> 00:54:58,920
a piano teacher for children.

1450
00:54:58,921 --> 00:55:00,031
Is it next to this house?

1451
00:55:00,691 --> 00:55:01,991
This is the one.

1452
00:55:03,601 --> 00:55:04,761
Yes, this is it.

1453
00:55:05,561 --> 00:55:06,630
Is she here?

1454
00:55:06,631 --> 00:55:07,801
(Also excited)

1455
00:55:08,771 --> 00:55:09,871
Ma'am.

1456
00:55:10,841 --> 00:55:12,841
- Hello.
- Is this the place?

1457
00:55:12,911 --> 00:55:16,040
(They revisit the place of memory as they have spare time.)

1458
00:55:16,041 --> 00:55:17,480
- She'll be so surprised.
- What was her name?

1459
00:55:17,481 --> 00:55:18,781
(They revisit the place of memory as they have spare time.)

1460
00:55:19,451 --> 00:55:21,051
I guess it's closed on weekends.

1461
00:55:21,481 --> 00:55:23,550
(Weekends are precious.)

1462
00:55:23,551 --> 00:55:25,920
She only got to talk to kids,

1463
00:55:25,921 --> 00:55:27,320
so she wanted to talk to adults.

1464
00:55:27,321 --> 00:55:28,851
She needed some adult conversations.

1465
00:55:29,021 --> 00:55:30,221
Did you win that time?

1466
00:55:30,661 --> 00:55:32,930
- We succeeded.
- We did.

1467
00:55:32,931 --> 00:55:35,230
- We gave her the prizes.
- Did we get to Round Two?

1468
00:55:35,231 --> 00:55:36,301
We did.

1469
00:55:37,161 --> 00:55:39,000
It's already packed.

1470
00:55:39,001 --> 00:55:41,800
- Oh, they open at 10am.
- At 10am.

1471
00:55:41,801 --> 00:55:43,670
- This must be a good one.
- It's already full.

1472
00:55:43,671 --> 00:55:45,641
- It's already full.
- This looks like...

1473
00:55:45,701 --> 00:55:47,410
- Is that...
- We have to wait in line.

1474
00:55:47,411 --> 00:55:49,111
- We have to get in line.
- There's a line.

1475
00:55:49,281 --> 00:55:50,440
- Look at that.
- Goodness.

1476
00:55:50,441 --> 00:55:51,480
The line is in the back.

1477
00:55:51,481 --> 00:55:53,110
- Hello.
- Hello.

1478
00:55:53,111 --> 00:55:54,581
- Is this a famous restaurant?
- Yes.

1479
00:55:54,611 --> 00:55:55,751
What are they famous for?

1480
00:55:56,021 --> 00:55:57,420
- Jjajangmyeon.
- Really?

1481
00:55:57,421 --> 00:55:58,751
- Jjajangmyeon and jjamppong?
- Jjajangmyeon and jjamppong?

1482
00:55:59,391 --> 00:56:00,591
It must be old.

1483
00:56:00,621 --> 00:56:02,150
They're so famous...

1484
00:56:02,151 --> 00:56:04,321
- that they open at 10am.
- Did you ask?

1485
00:56:04,691 --> 00:56:06,161
- Is it 10:30am?
- Yes.

1486
00:56:06,791 --> 00:56:08,191
- Oh, no.
- What's wrong?

1487
00:56:08,591 --> 00:56:09,900
It's going to be so good.

1488
00:56:09,901 --> 00:56:11,400
- Really?
- Really? Did you get a look?

1489
00:56:11,401 --> 00:56:13,670
Yes. It's wild in there.

1490
00:56:13,671 --> 00:56:15,400
- Is it?
- The people are...

1491
00:56:15,401 --> 00:56:16,700
eating so hurriedly.

1492
00:56:16,701 --> 00:56:17,971
(His heart races.)

1493
00:56:18,101 --> 00:56:19,711
Isn't this...

1494
00:56:20,211 --> 00:56:22,140
our first time waiting in line?

1495
00:56:22,141 --> 00:56:23,611
We rarely do.

1496
00:56:24,311 --> 00:56:25,640
I can't remember the last time we did.

1497
00:56:25,641 --> 00:56:27,750
Also, jjajangmyeon and jjamppong don't take too long to eat.

1498
00:56:27,751 --> 00:56:29,011
- That's true.
- You're right.

1499
00:56:29,051 --> 00:56:30,921
- It has a high turnover rate.
- I bet it does.

1500
00:56:31,451 --> 00:56:34,250
When you go down this road,

1501
00:56:34,251 --> 00:56:36,621
there's Gyeongbokgung Palace.

1502
00:56:36,661 --> 00:56:38,891
Next to Gyeongbokgung Station is...

1503
00:56:39,091 --> 00:56:41,930
the Seoul Metropolitan Police, and I did my military service there.

1504
00:56:41,931 --> 00:56:43,800
- Oh, you did.
- I see.

1505
00:56:43,801 --> 00:56:45,760
- He was an enlisted police officer.
- I was.

1506
00:56:45,761 --> 00:56:47,570
You must know this area well.

1507
00:56:47,571 --> 00:56:49,940
I remember coming here...

1508
00:56:49,941 --> 00:56:51,301
- about ten years ago.
- You've been here?

1509
00:56:51,401 --> 00:56:53,310
Yes. It's always been famous...

1510
00:56:53,311 --> 00:56:55,770
as a good restaurant.

1511
00:56:55,771 --> 00:56:58,611
Hearing that, I can't wait to eat it,

1512
00:56:59,611 --> 00:57:00,881
but the line won't get any shorter.

1513
00:57:00,981 --> 00:57:02,281
It's not?

1514
00:57:02,951 --> 00:57:04,680
Not until the first group of customers is done.

1515
00:57:04,681 --> 00:57:06,350
- Right. But when they leave, - Or...

1516
00:57:06,351 --> 00:57:07,890
- we'll be inside in no time.
- they're cleaning up...

1517
00:57:07,891 --> 00:57:10,091
- after they're gone.
- I see.

1518
00:57:10,191 --> 00:57:12,061
- Then, they'll go in soon.
- I think so.

1519
00:57:13,191 --> 00:57:14,730
It must be so good.

1520
00:57:14,731 --> 00:57:16,800
- As I'm waiting, - I can't wait to eat it.

1521
00:57:16,801 --> 00:57:18,360
I'm thinking, "I can't wait to eat it."

1522
00:57:18,361 --> 00:57:20,870
Then, I see the empty bulgogi place across the street...

1523
00:57:20,871 --> 00:57:22,471
and think, "Should I go there instead?"

1524
00:57:22,901 --> 00:57:24,740
Then, we have to go back around to cross the street.

1525
00:57:24,741 --> 00:57:25,770
They're not even open.

1526
00:57:25,771 --> 00:57:26,870
- Right.
- I think they open at 11am.

1527
00:57:26,871 --> 00:57:28,540
- We'd have to cross again, right?
- Yes.

1528
00:57:28,541 --> 00:57:30,580
- We'd have to go back.
- Then, I must wait.

1529
00:57:30,581 --> 00:57:31,641
Yes.

1530
00:57:32,681 --> 00:57:34,110
They're going in.

1531
00:57:34,111 --> 00:57:35,450
- They are.
- A lot of them are.

1532
00:57:35,451 --> 00:57:36,821
- There they go.
- Yes.

1533
00:57:37,621 --> 00:57:39,721
Do we have to take the bus?

1534
00:57:39,891 --> 00:57:41,090
To the next destination?

1535
00:57:41,091 --> 00:57:42,591
Can't we call a deluxe taxi?

1536
00:57:44,391 --> 00:57:45,990
(Promoting his friend's new show whenever possible)

1537
00:57:45,991 --> 00:57:48,060
- Well, my taxi is...
- It's in Sinan.

1538
00:57:48,061 --> 00:57:50,330
- in Sinan right now.
- Oh, because it's far away.

1539
00:57:50,331 --> 00:57:51,760
You must have gotten very good at driving.

1540
00:57:51,761 --> 00:57:54,000
Yes. There is...

1541
00:57:54,001 --> 00:57:55,831
a scene where I drift.

1542
00:57:55,971 --> 00:57:59,540
My action director taught me how to do it,

1543
00:57:59,541 --> 00:58:01,511
and they remodeled the car for it.

1544
00:58:01,711 --> 00:58:03,781
So, I've tried it a few times.

1545
00:58:04,181 --> 00:58:06,681
It was so fascinating,

1546
00:58:06,881 --> 00:58:10,150
and I felt like the main character in a movie.

1547
00:58:10,151 --> 00:58:12,421
- But you are the main character.
- Oh, you're right.

1548
00:58:12,551 --> 00:58:14,090
- You're the lead role.
- I am.

1549
00:58:14,091 --> 00:58:16,220
You literally are the main character in a movie.

1550
00:58:16,221 --> 00:58:17,421
(He realized who he was a bit too late.)

1551
00:58:17,921 --> 00:58:20,260
But it's never felt that real.

1552
00:58:20,261 --> 00:58:22,661
It's taking longer than I expected.

1553
00:58:23,731 --> 00:58:25,161
- You're not regretting it, are you?
- No.

1554
00:58:25,201 --> 00:58:27,071
- They're coming out.
- There they are.

1555
00:58:27,401 --> 00:58:29,371
- Soon...
- I think we'll go in soon.

1556
00:58:29,641 --> 00:58:31,441
Yeon Seok, take a seat.

1557
00:58:31,571 --> 00:58:32,600
No, you can...

1558
00:58:32,601 --> 00:58:34,571
- Sit here?
- No.

1559
00:58:35,441 --> 00:58:37,481
- The old man should...
- Right.

1560
00:58:37,641 --> 00:58:38,881
- That's not what I mean.
- But...

1561
00:58:39,011 --> 00:58:40,681
there's a young boy also sitting here.

1562
00:58:41,551 --> 00:58:42,551
"A young boy."

1563
00:58:42,552 --> 00:58:44,150
You can't say that when even a young boy is sitting.

1564
00:58:44,151 --> 00:58:45,421
Age equals rank.

1565
00:58:46,021 --> 00:58:48,191
- Ye Jin, do you want to sit?
- I'm fine.

1566
00:58:48,421 --> 00:58:50,090
- You look pretty good.
- Yes.

1567
00:58:50,091 --> 00:58:51,821
(Showing etiquette)

1568
00:58:52,021 --> 00:58:54,590
Who suggested coming here? Your parents?

1569
00:58:54,591 --> 00:58:56,501
- I did.
- Oh, really?

1570
00:58:57,101 --> 00:58:59,001
He instantly began communicating with the citizens.

1571
00:58:59,161 --> 00:59:02,230
I'm not the type to wait,

1572
00:59:02,231 --> 00:59:04,900
even if it's an incredibly famous restaurant.

1573
00:59:04,901 --> 00:59:06,241
(The boy never asked.)

1574
00:59:06,441 --> 00:59:08,311
- But this place is worth the wait?
- Yes.

1575
00:59:10,581 --> 00:59:13,351
- A photo.
- I can just fill my stomach.

1576
00:59:13,981 --> 00:59:16,821
- But the staff...
- No problem.

1577
00:59:17,451 --> 00:59:19,180
(The next customers in line enter.)

1578
00:59:19,181 --> 00:59:20,291
See?

1579
00:59:20,421 --> 00:59:22,350
We're almost there.

1580
00:59:22,351 --> 00:59:23,760
And the party of four.

1581
00:59:23,761 --> 00:59:24,891
Us too?

1582
00:59:25,491 --> 00:59:27,061
- Let's go.
- My mouth is watering.

1583
00:59:27,191 --> 00:59:28,691
- I can't wait.
- All right.

1584
00:59:29,061 --> 00:59:30,930
- It feels so nice.
- Please blur other people.

1585
00:59:30,931 --> 00:59:31,961
- Okay.
- Okay.

1586
00:59:32,631 --> 00:59:34,000
They're eating jjamppong rice.

1587
00:59:34,001 --> 00:59:35,600
- Where's the menu?
- The menu?

1588
00:59:35,601 --> 00:59:37,441
- It's good? Jjamppong rice?
- It's up there.

1589
00:59:37,941 --> 00:59:39,610
Jjamppong rice is sold out first.

1590
00:59:39,611 --> 00:59:40,640
This place is famous for jjamppong rice.

1591
00:59:40,641 --> 00:59:42,070
She says their jjamppong rice is the best.

1592
00:59:42,071 --> 00:59:43,540
- Jjamppong rice.
- They're sold out first.

1593
00:59:43,541 --> 00:59:45,241
- And kkanpunggi.
- Oh, kkanpunggi!

1594
00:59:45,811 --> 00:59:48,011
- Can we order jjamppong rice?
- Yes.

1595
00:59:48,281 --> 00:59:50,350
- You've been here before.
- I have.

1596
00:59:50,351 --> 00:59:52,080
- You were here before, Je Hoon?
- You sat over there.

1597
00:59:52,081 --> 00:59:53,591
- Yes, she remembers.
- I did.

1598
00:59:53,791 --> 00:59:56,421
I'll have jjamppong rice.

1599
00:59:56,721 --> 00:59:58,021
Also, kkanpunggi and tangsuyuk.

1600
00:59:58,361 --> 00:59:59,790
Kkanpunggi is sold out today.

1601
00:59:59,791 --> 01:00:02,090
- Kkanpunggi is sold out?
- Yes.

1602
01:00:02,091 --> 01:00:03,661
- Just tangsuyuk, then.
- But it's still morning.

1603
01:00:03,761 --> 01:00:05,530
- Then...
- One tangsuyuk,

1604
01:00:05,531 --> 01:00:08,300
one jjamppong rice, one jjajangmyeon,

1605
01:00:08,301 --> 01:00:10,371
one fried rice, and one more jjajangmyeon.

1606
01:00:10,741 --> 01:00:12,670
But everyone is eating jjamppong.

1607
01:00:12,671 --> 01:00:14,810
I know. Wait, should I get jjajangmyeon?

1608
01:00:14,811 --> 01:00:16,111
Or jjamppong?

1609
01:00:17,011 --> 01:00:18,740
- Ma'am.
- Yes?

1610
01:00:18,741 --> 01:00:20,780
- I'll have jjamppong instead.
- What was your original order?

1611
01:00:20,781 --> 01:00:22,550
No, I'll just eat jjamppong rice.

1612
01:00:22,551 --> 01:00:23,580
- You can...
- No.

1613
01:00:23,581 --> 01:00:24,780
- No.
- Ignore us.

1614
01:00:24,781 --> 01:00:26,051
- So, jjamppong rice?
- Yes.

1615
01:00:26,491 --> 01:00:28,150
- Why are you so distracted?
- It's just...

1616
01:00:28,151 --> 01:00:30,591
- You can taste mine.
- that I'm anxious.

1617
01:00:31,621 --> 01:00:34,231
It makes me anxious that they're running out of food.

1618
01:00:34,331 --> 01:00:35,660
(To help him with his anxiety...)

1619
01:00:35,661 --> 01:00:36,800
- The restaurant...
- Your tangsuyuk is here.

1620
01:00:36,801 --> 01:00:37,901
Thank you.

1621
01:00:38,601 --> 01:00:40,230
- Gosh.
- They stir-fry it first.

1622
01:00:40,231 --> 01:00:41,371
Right.

1623
01:00:42,071 --> 01:00:43,500
- Oh, my gosh.
- Goodness.

1624
01:00:43,501 --> 01:00:45,000
- That looks scrumptious.
- It looks so good.

1625
01:00:45,001 --> 01:00:46,710
- This is...
- It looks so delicious.

1626
01:00:46,711 --> 01:00:47,970
- Thanks for the food.
- Let's eat.

1627
01:00:47,971 --> 01:00:49,270
(They waited 30 minutes for the 1st dish.)

1628
01:00:49,271 --> 01:00:50,941
Thank you for the food.

1629
01:00:51,011 --> 01:00:52,081
Are there two of you?

1630
01:00:52,181 --> 01:00:53,551
(Moaning)

1631
01:00:53,581 --> 01:00:55,581
Then I can take just one person?

1632
01:00:56,251 --> 01:00:57,321
It's neat.

1633
01:00:57,821 --> 01:00:59,151
(Moaning)

1634
01:00:59,481 --> 01:01:00,820
(Gasping)

1635
01:01:00,821 --> 01:01:01,891
- It's neat.
- Yes.

1636
01:01:02,151 --> 01:01:03,321
No way!

1637
01:01:04,621 --> 01:01:08,060
(Definitely worth the wait)

1638
01:01:08,061 --> 01:01:09,161
It's neat.

1639
01:01:10,131 --> 01:01:11,961
(Nodding)

1640
01:01:12,131 --> 01:01:14,031
(Nodding as well)

1641
01:01:15,571 --> 01:01:17,640
- I have to come back to this place.
- Yes.

1642
01:01:17,641 --> 01:01:19,140
(One bite of tangsuyuk, and she wants to be a regular.)

1643
01:01:19,141 --> 01:01:20,410
It opens at 10am.

1644
01:01:20,411 --> 01:01:21,741
It's insanely good.

1645
01:01:22,641 --> 01:01:23,940
How is it so crispy?

1646
01:01:23,941 --> 01:01:25,911
I bet these flat dumplings are also crispy.

1647
01:01:26,651 --> 01:01:29,151
(They're fried dumplings, not flat dumplings.)

1648
01:01:32,251 --> 01:01:33,321
The dumplings are hot.

1649
01:01:33,921 --> 01:01:35,321
(Oh, my!)

1650
01:01:37,621 --> 01:01:38,690
It's tasty.

1651
01:01:38,691 --> 01:01:42,761
(The taste you want to shove into your mouth even if it gets burnt)

1652
01:01:43,661 --> 01:01:44,930
- Here you go.
- Thank you.

1653
01:01:44,931 --> 01:01:46,530
(The 3 popular dishes of Chinese cuisine appear.)

1654
01:01:46,531 --> 01:01:48,001
The noodles are very thin.

1655
01:01:48,171 --> 01:01:49,331
They look so tasty.

1656
01:01:52,001 --> 01:01:53,410
- This dish has rice inside.
- Yes.

1657
01:01:53,411 --> 01:01:55,211
This is the last jjamppong rice of the day.

1658
01:01:55,671 --> 01:01:56,710
Really?

1659
01:01:56,711 --> 01:01:59,781
(The last jjamppong rice of the day)

1660
01:02:02,481 --> 01:02:03,651
(Impressed)

1661
01:02:04,021 --> 01:02:06,151
- It's jjamppong rice.
- It's tasty.

1662
01:02:06,591 --> 01:02:08,821
That's why this restaurant closes early.

1663
01:02:09,391 --> 01:02:10,920
- You're right. This dish...
- It's tasty.

1664
01:02:10,921 --> 01:02:12,061
Thank you.

1665
01:02:13,561 --> 01:02:15,391
People will need to come back here.

1666
01:02:15,531 --> 01:02:17,701
- Seriously.
- I know. This is the last one.

1667
01:02:19,561 --> 01:02:20,631
It's so tasty.

1668
01:02:22,431 --> 01:02:23,501
It's tasty, right?

1669
01:02:24,171 --> 01:02:26,071
This soup... My goodness.

1670
01:02:26,241 --> 01:02:27,711
- It's incredible, right?
- How fascinating.

1671
01:02:33,311 --> 01:02:34,411
It settles the stomach.

1672
01:02:35,511 --> 01:02:36,621
It settles the stomach.

1673
01:02:36,721 --> 01:02:37,781
It's tasty, right?

1674
01:02:39,051 --> 01:02:41,951
(They inhale the food wordlessly.)

1675
01:02:43,091 --> 01:02:44,891
The rice dishes are sold out.

1676
01:02:45,021 --> 01:02:46,890
Some dishes are sold out.

1677
01:02:46,891 --> 01:02:48,060
- What?
- They're done.

1678
01:02:48,061 --> 01:02:49,061
(At 11am, the rice dishes are sold out.)

1679
01:02:49,062 --> 01:02:50,400
- Are they done?
- My goodness.

1680
01:02:50,401 --> 01:02:52,330
We did an amazing job of lining up.

1681
01:02:52,331 --> 01:02:54,531
- We got lucky.
- The line got cut off.

1682
01:02:54,971 --> 01:02:56,971
(He's absorbed in the food.)

1683
01:02:59,401 --> 01:03:00,511
- It's tasty, right?
- Yes.

1684
01:03:01,271 --> 01:03:02,641
- Aren't you glad that you lined up?
- It's so tasty.

1685
01:03:03,541 --> 01:03:06,081
- That line was perfectly doable.
- Yes.

1686
01:03:06,481 --> 01:03:07,711
- Did we wait for about 20 minutes?
- Yes.

1687
01:03:08,251 --> 01:03:11,321
I forgot about the athletes for a second.

1688
01:03:11,521 --> 01:03:12,551
We're sorry.

1689
01:03:13,651 --> 01:03:16,291
- We'll cheer up and succeed in it.
- We'll succeed in it.

1690
01:03:17,191 --> 01:03:19,621
We can't play a noisy game to decide who pays today.

1691
01:03:21,061 --> 01:03:22,391
Let's play a simple game.

1692
01:03:23,731 --> 01:03:25,661
- Shall we do that?
- Sure.

1693
01:03:26,671 --> 01:03:27,671
Let's do that.

1694
01:03:27,672 --> 01:03:28,901
- Do what?
- Let's do anything.

1695
01:03:29,501 --> 01:03:31,341
- It's a game that uses AI.
- Okay.

1696
01:03:32,071 --> 01:03:34,141
You choose two random numbers...

1697
01:03:34,371 --> 01:03:36,881
- from 1 to 20.
- Okay.

1698
01:03:36,981 --> 01:03:39,411
Then you let AI choose one of the arithmetic operations.

1699
01:03:39,881 --> 01:03:43,481
Let's say you choose 2 and 10.

1700
01:03:43,781 --> 01:03:46,850
AI might choose multiplication, division,

1701
01:03:46,851 --> 01:03:49,091
- subtraction, or addition.
- Okay.

1702
01:03:49,651 --> 01:03:52,921
The person with the lowest or highest result pays.

1703
01:03:53,761 --> 01:03:55,230
Let's begin.

1704
01:03:55,231 --> 01:03:56,231
(Deciding who pays)

1705
01:03:56,501 --> 01:03:58,931
- Shall I begin?
- Je Hoon.

1706
01:04:00,471 --> 01:04:02,200
- Twenty.
- Twenty.

1707
01:04:02,201 --> 01:04:03,770
Nine. Twenty and...

1708
01:04:03,771 --> 01:04:04,971
- Twenty and nine.
- Yes.

1709
01:04:08,571 --> 01:04:09,840
You got multiplication.

1710
01:04:09,841 --> 01:04:11,640
(Je Hoon: 20 times 9, 180)

1711
01:04:11,641 --> 01:04:12,810
You got multiplication.

1712
01:04:12,811 --> 01:04:14,481
(He gets 180.)

1713
01:04:15,811 --> 01:04:16,981
Then it's 180.

1714
01:04:17,351 --> 01:04:18,550
- It looks like...
- Then it's 180.

1715
01:04:18,551 --> 01:04:20,191
- I won't pay.
- He won't get chosen.

1716
01:04:20,251 --> 01:04:21,551
I choose 3 and 18.

1717
01:04:21,921 --> 01:04:23,821
- Three and eighteen?
- Three and eighteen.

1718
01:04:24,791 --> 01:04:26,431
- You got multiplication.
- Eighteen again?

1719
01:04:26,561 --> 01:04:28,090
Why is it multiplying all the numbers?

1720
01:04:28,091 --> 01:04:29,190
You got multiplication.

1721
01:04:29,191 --> 01:04:30,260
Eighteen again?

1722
01:04:30,261 --> 01:04:31,431
Why is it multiplying all the numbers?

1723
01:04:31,731 --> 01:04:33,000
Fifty-four.

1724
01:04:33,001 --> 01:04:34,100
- What's the result?
- Fifty-four.

1725
01:04:34,101 --> 01:04:35,101
Fifty-four.

1726
01:04:35,471 --> 01:04:37,201
I choose 20 and 19.

1727
01:04:38,201 --> 01:04:39,241
You decided to take a chance.

1728
01:04:39,341 --> 01:04:40,711
- You choose 20 and 19.
- I think you'll get subtraction.

1729
01:04:40,971 --> 01:04:42,611
- Let's get multiplication.
- Okay.

1730
01:04:43,581 --> 01:04:45,211
- Please let it be multiplication.
- It's subtraction.

1731
01:04:46,341 --> 01:04:47,350
(Thus, Jae Suk's equation is 20 minus 19 equals 1.)

1732
01:04:47,351 --> 01:04:48,381
It's subtraction.

1733
01:04:48,981 --> 01:04:50,021
One.

1734
01:04:51,321 --> 01:04:52,321
- Hold on.
- One.

1735
01:04:52,322 --> 01:04:53,391
Now...

1736
01:04:53,651 --> 01:04:54,890
- Number 1.
- Number 1.

1737
01:04:54,891 --> 01:04:56,761
- I just need to avoid getting one.
- That's right.

1738
01:04:57,091 --> 01:04:58,661
Pick any numbers. How about zero?

1739
01:04:58,891 --> 01:05:00,031
Twelve and two.

1740
01:05:00,431 --> 01:05:01,791
- Twelve and two.
- Division.

1741
01:05:01,991 --> 01:05:03,361
- The result is five.
- Five.

1742
01:05:04,701 --> 01:05:05,761
That was neat.

1743
01:05:07,401 --> 01:05:09,400
- Thank you for the food.
- I don't mind paying,

1744
01:05:09,401 --> 01:05:10,471
- but it was too...
- It was so tasty.

1745
01:05:11,001 --> 01:05:12,371
What a strange game.

1746
01:05:13,541 --> 01:05:14,911
After giving us multiplication multiple times...

1747
01:05:15,541 --> 01:05:16,811
- They're busy.
- I'll go and pay.

1748
01:05:17,411 --> 01:05:18,710
Thank you for the food.

1749
01:05:18,711 --> 01:05:20,781
- Ma'am, I'm ready to pay.
- The total is 60 dollars.

1750
01:05:20,911 --> 01:05:22,010
Okay.

1751
01:05:22,011 --> 01:05:23,181
(Staring)

1752
01:05:24,081 --> 01:05:25,581
He pays out of pocket for real.

1753
01:05:25,821 --> 01:05:27,091
I don't know why I haven't come here sooner.

1754
01:05:28,221 --> 01:05:29,321
Thank you for the food.

1755
01:05:29,591 --> 01:05:31,291
- Thank you.
- Thank you for the food.

1756
01:05:38,631 --> 01:05:40,000
- Hello.
- Enjoy your meal.

1757
01:05:40,001 --> 01:05:41,071
- Okay.
- Enjoy your meal.

1758
01:05:41,701 --> 01:05:44,371
We can take a bus in front of Cheongwadae.

1759
01:05:44,501 --> 01:05:45,541
Cheongwadae?

1760
01:05:45,701 --> 01:05:47,341
We need to go that way to reach Cheongwadae.

1761
01:05:49,141 --> 01:05:50,311
You used to work...

1762
01:05:51,381 --> 01:05:53,351
- at the Office of the President.
- In a drama?

1763
01:05:53,951 --> 01:05:56,010
- You're right.
- Yes.

1764
01:05:56,011 --> 01:05:58,081
- Sure.
- You used to work there.

1765
01:05:58,221 --> 01:06:00,151
Let's go to my former workplace.

1766
01:06:00,391 --> 01:06:01,591
- You know...
- In front of Cheongwadae.

1767
01:06:02,051 --> 01:06:03,291
Look at the fountain in front of Cheongwadae.

1768
01:06:04,021 --> 01:06:05,420
- It's nice.
- What's this?

1769
01:06:05,421 --> 01:06:07,161
Gosh, it's cool.

1770
01:06:08,091 --> 01:06:09,160
- That's...
- It's a phoenix.

1771
01:06:09,161 --> 01:06:10,561
- It's a phoenix.
- A phoenix.

1772
01:06:10,731 --> 01:06:11,930
(Staring)

1773
01:06:11,931 --> 01:06:15,471
Jae Suk, his wife, and...

1774
01:06:16,541 --> 01:06:17,601
Ji Ho.

1775
01:06:19,201 --> 01:06:20,241
What's that?

1776
01:06:23,641 --> 01:06:24,641
(Thinking)

1777
01:06:24,642 --> 01:06:25,711
Those are Chinese characters.

1778
01:06:27,211 --> 01:06:29,081
I was going to read it, but the characters were difficult.

1779
01:06:29,251 --> 01:06:31,320
Gosh, look at that.

1780
01:06:31,321 --> 01:06:33,151
The view is so beautiful with the mountain in the back.

1781
01:06:33,491 --> 01:06:35,221
- It's so cool.
- It's cool.

1782
01:06:35,651 --> 01:06:37,461
The location is perfect.

1783
01:06:37,991 --> 01:06:39,061
What a view.

1784
01:06:40,861 --> 01:06:42,390
- Seriously, back in the day...
- Jae Suk.

1785
01:06:42,391 --> 01:06:43,760
- Can't we take a group photo?
- Back in the day...

1786
01:06:43,761 --> 01:06:45,201
We don't have much time.

1787
01:06:45,601 --> 01:06:47,970
- A group photo, my foot.
- We just need to cross the road.

1788
01:06:47,971 --> 01:06:49,730
- We need to hurry up.
- The bus isn't here yet.

1789
01:06:49,731 --> 01:06:51,670
Back in the day, I came here for "Exclamation Mark."

1790
01:06:51,671 --> 01:06:53,970
- It's my 1st time here.
- Then it was 20 years ago.

1791
01:06:53,971 --> 01:06:55,271
How is it your first time here?

1792
01:06:55,841 --> 01:06:57,280
You worked at the Office of the President.

1793
01:06:57,281 --> 01:06:58,741
Those scenes were filmed on a set.

1794
01:07:01,651 --> 01:07:03,881
We should've taken a photo in front of the phoenix.

1795
01:07:05,451 --> 01:07:08,591
- Yeon Seok loves taking photos.
- That's right.

1796
01:07:09,051 --> 01:07:11,220
Recently, I found a Polaroid photo...

1797
01:07:11,221 --> 01:07:13,831
I took with Suzy while filming "Architecture 101."

1798
01:07:14,091 --> 01:07:15,091
I still...

1799
01:07:15,092 --> 01:07:16,860
- Don't talk about Suzy, you punk.
- Why?

1800
01:07:16,861 --> 01:07:19,301
- I'm talking about a memory.
- You wronged Je Hoon.

1801
01:07:19,531 --> 01:07:20,670
You wronged Je Hoon.

1802
01:07:20,671 --> 01:07:22,100
I'm talking about a memory.

1803
01:07:22,101 --> 01:07:23,600
- I'm talking about an old photo.
- Senior in glasses.

1804
01:07:23,601 --> 01:07:24,740
- My goodness.
- Do you have it?

1805
01:07:24,741 --> 01:07:26,200
- I have it too. I still have it.
- Really?

1806
01:07:26,201 --> 01:07:28,071
- Really? That's right.
- Yes. You took that photo.

1807
01:07:28,211 --> 01:07:31,181
It was a Polaroid photo we took together.

1808
01:07:32,011 --> 01:07:34,710
- Even after ten years...
- I know.

1809
01:07:34,711 --> 01:07:35,750
(Even after a decade or more, they reminisce about the movie.)

1810
01:07:35,751 --> 01:07:37,921
- It was so much fun.
- You're right.

1811
01:07:38,581 --> 01:07:39,781
- It's here.
- Let's get on the bus.

1812
01:07:39,991 --> 01:07:41,391
- Nice.
- It's pretty.

1813
01:07:43,561 --> 01:07:44,690
- It's cute.
- Get on the bus first.

1814
01:07:44,691 --> 01:07:45,721
Okay.

1815
01:07:46,161 --> 01:07:47,990
- Hello.
- Hello.

1816
01:07:47,991 --> 01:07:49,961
- The weather is perfect.
- I know.

1817
01:07:50,301 --> 01:07:51,460
It isn't even cloudy. Right?

1818
01:07:51,461 --> 01:07:54,670
Soon, the weather will be too cold.

1819
01:07:54,671 --> 01:07:55,701
I know.

1820
01:07:56,431 --> 01:07:58,241
Je Hoon, we were locked on an island.

1821
01:07:58,571 --> 01:08:00,210
- I know. I'm back in the city.
- This is...

1822
01:08:00,211 --> 01:08:01,911
Yes. This is a nice outing.

1823
01:08:02,541 --> 01:08:03,841
That's what it feels like, right?

1824
01:08:06,311 --> 01:08:09,081
What? They're filming something.

1825
01:08:09,181 --> 01:08:10,221
What?

1826
01:08:10,521 --> 01:08:11,681
- Where?
- Maybe I'm wrong.

1827
01:08:11,821 --> 01:08:13,220
- They're getting ready.
- You're right.

1828
01:08:13,221 --> 01:08:14,821
- They're filming something.
- A rainy scene.

1829
01:08:15,191 --> 01:08:16,390
- They're filming something.
- Is it a rainy scene?

1830
01:08:16,391 --> 01:08:18,221
Yes. I think they'll use a sprinkler truck.

1831
01:08:18,391 --> 01:08:19,990
You're right. They'll use a sprinkler truck.

1832
01:08:19,991 --> 01:08:20,991
(It seems like they'll film a rainy scene on a sunny day.)

1833
01:08:20,992 --> 01:08:22,131
It's a filming crew.

1834
01:08:22,961 --> 01:08:25,930
We're actors who always film things.

1835
01:08:25,931 --> 01:08:27,600
- Yes.
- But when we see a crew outside,

1836
01:08:27,601 --> 01:08:29,230
- we go, "Is this a shoot?"
- That's right. I do the same.

1837
01:08:29,231 --> 01:08:30,941
I check if there's a script.

1838
01:08:31,241 --> 01:08:32,441
- I can't help but check.
- I know.

1839
01:08:33,071 --> 01:08:34,711
Do you know what she said?

1840
01:08:34,811 --> 01:08:36,681
She was on TV one time,

1841
01:08:36,841 --> 01:08:38,481
and her face looked this big.

1842
01:08:38,741 --> 01:08:40,451
She said that you shouldn't stand next to celebrities.

1843
01:08:41,681 --> 01:08:42,750
You said that, right?

1844
01:08:42,751 --> 01:08:44,120
(The two hosts are busy communicating with the citizens.)

1845
01:08:44,121 --> 01:08:45,251
Which show was it?

1846
01:08:46,251 --> 01:08:47,391
Who are the actors?

1847
01:08:48,751 --> 01:08:52,361
(They look outside the window in a carefree manner.)

1848
01:08:53,261 --> 01:08:54,630
With the two of them,

1849
01:08:54,631 --> 01:08:56,090
- it feels like an outing.
- Yes.

1850
01:08:56,091 --> 01:08:57,701
- It looks like we're on a date, no?
- It looks like you're on a date.

1851
01:08:59,501 --> 01:09:01,801
(They look like a couple who are visiting Seoul.)

1852
01:09:01,871 --> 01:09:02,930
We...

1853
01:09:02,931 --> 01:09:04,670
(How about us?)

1854
01:09:04,671 --> 01:09:06,001
It looks like we're working.

1855
01:09:07,471 --> 01:09:09,670
- It's just a shoot.
- For us, it's just a shoot.

1856
01:09:09,671 --> 01:09:11,410
- For them, it's a date.
- It looks like they're on a date.

1857
01:09:11,411 --> 01:09:13,380
Ye Jin is wearing a bag across the chest,

1858
01:09:13,381 --> 01:09:15,281
- so it really feels like a date.
- You're right.

1859
01:09:15,851 --> 01:09:18,221
Let's go and find the second Whenever Guests.

1860
01:09:18,381 --> 01:09:20,151
Yu Jeong Il and Kim Yu Jin.

1861
01:09:20,451 --> 01:09:21,921
"We're the husband who loves ballad..."

1862
01:09:22,051 --> 01:09:24,591
"and the wife who loves heavy metal."

1863
01:09:25,861 --> 01:09:27,931
"While our hairstyle is the same,"

1864
01:09:28,231 --> 01:09:29,590
"our tastes in music, personalities,"

1865
01:09:29,591 --> 01:09:30,600
- "and clothing styles are..."
- Are they different?

1866
01:09:30,601 --> 01:09:31,631
"the exact opposites."

1867
01:09:32,001 --> 01:09:34,831
"We invite Whenever Possible to the leisurely Nagwon, or paradise,"

1868
01:09:35,031 --> 01:09:36,430
"of the couple that resembles..."

1869
01:09:36,431 --> 01:09:37,840
"a beautiful harmony of different notes."

1870
01:09:37,841 --> 01:09:40,311
Are they musicians? Do they run a cafe?

1871
01:09:40,471 --> 01:09:41,970
They mentioned "Nagwon."

1872
01:09:41,971 --> 01:09:45,641
- Nagwon Arcade in Jongno.
- Nagwon Arcade.

1873
01:09:45,811 --> 01:09:47,050
- Wouldn't it be that place?
- You might be right.

1874
01:09:47,051 --> 01:09:48,850
- Right.
- There's an instrument arcade.

1875
01:09:48,851 --> 01:09:50,921
- That's right.
- That might be the case.

1876
01:09:51,221 --> 01:09:53,851
It's on the second floor.

1877
01:09:54,391 --> 01:09:55,491
The second floor.

1878
01:09:55,951 --> 01:09:57,021
Hello.

1879
01:09:57,821 --> 01:09:59,491
- Goodness.
- It's an instrument store.

1880
01:09:59,761 --> 01:10:01,091
- There are guitars.
- Gosh.

1881
01:10:01,931 --> 01:10:04,931
(The paradise of instruments where all sounds gather)

1882
01:10:05,301 --> 01:10:07,370
(Wind instruments)

1883
01:10:07,371 --> 01:10:09,670
(Percussions)

1884
01:10:09,671 --> 01:10:12,801
(String instruments)

1885
01:10:12,971 --> 01:10:14,811
- Back in the day, - Hello.

1886
01:10:14,911 --> 01:10:16,270
people who played the guitar and other instruments...

1887
01:10:16,271 --> 01:10:17,681
- came here.
- That's right.

1888
01:10:17,841 --> 01:10:19,381
- They tried the guitars.
- That's right.

1889
01:10:19,641 --> 01:10:21,981
There are so many people.

1890
01:10:22,911 --> 01:10:24,121
- It's this way.
- It's next to that place.

1891
01:10:24,321 --> 01:10:25,880
- Where?
- It's B210.

1892
01:10:25,881 --> 01:10:27,391
- It's B210.
- You're right. This is the place.

1893
01:10:27,751 --> 01:10:29,090
- This is the place.
- Jeong Il and Yu Jin.

1894
01:10:29,091 --> 01:10:30,220
(A guitar place?)

1895
01:10:30,221 --> 01:10:32,060
- Hello.
- Welcome.

1896
01:10:32,061 --> 01:10:33,930
- Hello.
- You sent us a letter, right?

1897
01:10:33,931 --> 01:10:35,190
Yu Jeong Il and Kim Yu Jin.

1898
01:10:35,191 --> 01:10:36,931
- Yes. Hello.
- Hello.

1899
01:10:37,031 --> 01:10:39,131
- Nice to meet you. Hello.
- Hello.

1900
01:10:39,231 --> 01:10:40,870
- Hello.
- Nice to meet you.

1901
01:10:40,871 --> 01:10:43,400
We came to Nagwon Arcade...

1902
01:10:43,401 --> 01:10:45,671
- thanks to the two of you.
- There are so many guitars.

1903
01:10:46,601 --> 01:10:47,770
- Welcome.
- How cool.

1904
01:10:47,771 --> 01:10:48,940
- Nice to meet you.
- Nice to meet you.

1905
01:10:48,941 --> 01:10:50,381
- Goodness.
- It's a pleasure to have you here.

1906
01:10:50,711 --> 01:10:54,651
It must be a shop that specializes in electric guitars.

1907
01:10:54,711 --> 01:10:57,081
That's right. We specialize in electric guitars.

1908
01:10:57,221 --> 01:10:59,021
Like we said earlier...

1909
01:10:59,251 --> 01:11:00,490
Perhaps it's different now.

1910
01:11:00,491 --> 01:11:02,150
But when I was in high school, this place was the mecca.

1911
01:11:02,151 --> 01:11:04,961
- It was the mecca for musicians.
- Students who played instruments.

1912
01:11:05,621 --> 01:11:09,131
- Metal and band music were popular.
- That's right.

1913
01:11:09,761 --> 01:11:12,460
- They came here every weekend.
- Yes.

1914
01:11:12,461 --> 01:11:13,471
(People grew out their hair and dreamed of becoming a rocker.)

1915
01:11:13,601 --> 01:11:14,831
How are things now?

1916
01:11:15,601 --> 01:11:18,801
- Many customers come on weekends.
- Really?

1917
01:11:18,901 --> 01:11:23,270
These days, there's a surge in college bands.

1918
01:11:23,271 --> 01:11:24,280
(There's a surge in college bands!)

1919
01:11:24,281 --> 01:11:26,180
(DAY6)

1920
01:11:26,181 --> 01:11:28,550
(SILICA GEL)

1921
01:11:28,551 --> 01:11:30,921
(TOUCHED)

1922
01:11:31,751 --> 01:11:33,120
- There's a surge in the bands.
- Yes.

1923
01:11:33,121 --> 01:11:34,291
That's right.

1924
01:11:34,391 --> 01:11:36,320
So college students visit the most.

1925
01:11:36,321 --> 01:11:37,661
- Many college students visit.
- Yes.

1926
01:11:38,091 --> 01:11:39,761
But it's currently the exam period.

1927
01:11:40,331 --> 01:11:43,130
We hoped you'd come during the in-between times...

1928
01:11:43,131 --> 01:11:46,100
and give energy to Nagwon Arcade.

1929
01:11:46,101 --> 01:11:48,470
- That was why you sent a letter.
- The in-between times.

1930
01:11:48,471 --> 01:11:49,471
Yes.

1931
01:11:49,472 --> 01:11:53,340
You mentioned in the letter that the two of you had...

1932
01:11:53,341 --> 01:11:54,640
- Different styles.
- different styles.

1933
01:11:54,641 --> 01:11:55,740
- Yes.
- Yes.

1934
01:11:55,741 --> 01:11:58,010
- The wife likes heavy metal.
- Yes.

1935
01:11:58,011 --> 01:12:01,150
- The husband likes ballad music.
- Ballad music. That's right.

1936
01:12:01,151 --> 01:12:03,650
- I began learning music...
- Okay.

1937
01:12:03,651 --> 01:12:06,181
because I liked rock and such.

1938
01:12:06,651 --> 01:12:08,591
But as I aged,

1939
01:12:09,021 --> 01:12:10,220
I began to prefer ballad music.

1940
01:12:10,221 --> 01:12:11,420
(Now, he likes the sentimental ballad music.)

1941
01:12:11,421 --> 01:12:13,690
Yu Jin, do you like heavy metal?

1942
01:12:13,691 --> 01:12:15,590
Yes. In the shop,

1943
01:12:15,591 --> 01:12:17,700
I play a heavy metal song by Pantera.

1944
01:12:17,701 --> 01:12:19,861
When it ends, he plays a ballad song.

1945
01:12:20,271 --> 01:12:22,031
We always do that.

1946
01:12:22,631 --> 01:12:26,600
Have you had that hairstyle for many years?

1947
01:12:26,601 --> 01:12:28,270
You're right. I began having this hairstyle...

1948
01:12:28,271 --> 01:12:31,380
when I liked rock.

1949
01:12:31,381 --> 01:12:33,311
That was when I began growing out my hair.

1950
01:12:33,881 --> 01:12:36,610
I love maintaining this hairstyle.

1951
01:12:36,611 --> 01:12:37,720
That's why I still have it.

1952
01:12:37,721 --> 01:12:39,480
Your gestures tell me that you're used to having long hair.

1953
01:12:39,481 --> 01:12:41,090
- You do things like this.
- Yes.

1954
01:12:41,091 --> 01:12:42,490
(Coy)

1955
01:12:42,491 --> 01:12:44,421
He takes longer to get ready.

1956
01:12:44,521 --> 01:12:46,821
- Really?
- I wear makeup, but it's like that.

1957
01:12:47,331 --> 01:12:50,661
It takes me about an hour to take a shower and dry my hair.

1958
01:12:51,201 --> 01:12:53,100
- It takes a while.
- You put a lot of care into it.

1959
01:12:53,101 --> 01:12:55,370
- Your hair is well-maintained.
- Yes.

1960
01:12:55,371 --> 01:12:57,170
Even though he put his hair in a ponytail,

1961
01:12:57,171 --> 01:13:00,870
- he kept the volume.
- Yes.

1962
01:13:00,871 --> 01:13:02,440
- It's extraordinary.
- That's right.

1963
01:13:02,441 --> 01:13:05,041
- You did that on purpose.
- Let me tell you this.

1964
01:13:05,381 --> 01:13:08,350
- I used to pull my hair tight.
- Okay.

1965
01:13:08,351 --> 01:13:10,620
When I did that, people thought I had...

1966
01:13:10,621 --> 01:13:13,950
- the Cheonghakdong style.
- Cheonghakdong.

1967
01:13:13,951 --> 01:13:17,491
- Now, I add some volume.
- You add some volume.

1968
01:13:17,821 --> 01:13:20,161
- I'm satisfied with it.
- I see.

1969
01:13:20,491 --> 01:13:21,690
That's right.

1970
01:13:21,691 --> 01:13:24,160
Yu Jin, do you play an instrument as well?

1971
01:13:24,161 --> 01:13:25,830
- I was the vocalist.
- The vocalist.

1972
01:13:25,831 --> 01:13:28,000
(The vocalist!)

1973
01:13:28,001 --> 01:13:30,640
We met by chance.

1974
01:13:30,641 --> 01:13:32,140
I followed her around.

1975
01:13:32,141 --> 01:13:33,340
(The guitarist fell in love at first sight.)

1976
01:13:33,341 --> 01:13:35,011
I guess we were meant to be.

1977
01:13:35,641 --> 01:13:38,911
- Was it love at first sight?
- Yes, I fell for her right away...

1978
01:13:39,481 --> 01:13:40,581
and followed her around.

1979
01:13:40,911 --> 01:13:43,880
For how long have you been married?

1980
01:13:43,881 --> 01:13:45,721
We've been married for...

1981
01:13:47,921 --> 01:13:48,991
For...

1982
01:13:50,191 --> 01:13:51,890
(For...)

1983
01:13:51,891 --> 01:13:52,961
fourteen years.

1984
01:13:53,121 --> 01:13:54,491
It's been fifteen years.

1985
01:13:55,031 --> 01:13:56,061
Oh, right.

1986
01:13:56,491 --> 01:13:58,931
(He answered carefully, but it was incorrect.)

1987
01:13:59,031 --> 01:14:00,200
You need to avert this crisis.

1988
01:14:00,201 --> 01:14:01,801
- Did you do the calculations?
- Yes.

1989
01:14:02,231 --> 01:14:03,370
(Chuckling)

1990
01:14:03,371 --> 01:14:06,300
- I'm sure working together...
- Yes.

1991
01:14:06,301 --> 01:14:07,870
has its own perks.

1992
01:14:07,871 --> 01:14:10,210
But what's the hardest about it?

1993
01:14:10,211 --> 01:14:11,241
What's hard?

1994
01:14:11,341 --> 01:14:13,141
There's nothing hard about it.

1995
01:14:14,411 --> 01:14:15,480
There's nothing hard about it.

1996
01:14:15,481 --> 01:14:16,850
(He answers quickly!)

1997
01:14:16,851 --> 01:14:17,950
Not at all.

1998
01:14:17,951 --> 01:14:19,250
You averted the second crisis well.

1999
01:14:19,251 --> 01:14:20,750
Thank you.

2000
01:14:20,751 --> 01:14:22,021
(He averted the 2nd crisis well.)

2001
01:14:23,521 --> 01:14:24,661
You keep testing him.

2002
01:14:24,821 --> 01:14:28,390
Are there no hardships? You work together in the same place.

2003
01:14:28,391 --> 01:14:30,500
When you go home, you're together too.

2004
01:14:30,501 --> 01:14:31,630
- Right.
- Yes.

2005
01:14:31,631 --> 01:14:32,931
It's always fun.

2006
01:14:34,601 --> 01:14:36,770
- That was the third crisis.
- Thank you.

2007
01:14:36,771 --> 01:14:38,241
You averted the third crisis well.

2008
01:14:39,001 --> 01:14:40,201
I'm sweating.

2009
01:14:41,041 --> 01:14:42,210
I averted it well, right?

2010
01:14:42,211 --> 01:14:43,241
(The unofficial couple mission was successful!)

2011
01:14:44,381 --> 01:14:45,540
From the neighboring shop,

2012
01:14:45,541 --> 01:14:47,110
(They can hear instruments being played.)

2013
01:14:47,111 --> 01:14:48,451
- we can hear music.
- Yes.

2014
01:14:48,751 --> 01:14:51,220
Jeong Il, why don't you play the guitar for us?

2015
01:14:51,221 --> 01:14:52,980
- Just a little bit.
- Sure.

2016
01:14:52,981 --> 01:14:54,021
(He readily agrees.)

2017
01:14:54,391 --> 01:14:55,520
I love it.

2018
01:14:55,521 --> 01:14:56,521
(Excited)

2019
01:14:56,522 --> 01:14:58,761
- Please let us hear it.
- I refuse to lose.

2020
01:14:59,521 --> 01:15:00,991
(Proud)

2021
01:15:01,031 --> 01:15:02,431
- He took it off the wall.
- Yes.

2022
01:15:02,531 --> 01:15:04,760
This is the guitar I cherish.

2023
01:15:04,761 --> 01:15:07,200
Is there a reason why you cherish it?

2024
01:15:07,201 --> 01:15:09,831
- Because it's pretty. And...
- I see.

2025
01:15:10,601 --> 01:15:12,100
(Playing)

2026
01:15:12,101 --> 01:15:13,141
Yes.

2027
01:15:14,311 --> 01:15:15,311
Yes.

2028
01:15:17,611 --> 01:15:20,341
(His wife's favorite genre of music, heavy metal!)

2029
01:15:25,851 --> 01:15:26,851
(Impressed)

2030
01:15:26,852 --> 01:15:27,991
I got goosebumps.

2031
01:15:36,331 --> 01:15:37,561
I got goosebumps.

2032
01:15:38,501 --> 01:15:39,630
- He's good.
- Yes.

2033
01:15:39,631 --> 01:15:40,631
(It suits the taste of the heavy metal lover.)

2034
01:15:40,632 --> 01:15:44,000
He only played it for a short while, but the melody was incredible.

2035
01:15:44,001 --> 01:15:45,301
That's so cool.

2036
01:15:46,271 --> 01:15:47,271
- Oh, my.
- What?

2037
01:15:47,272 --> 01:15:48,711
- Hello, Jae Suk.
- Hey!

2038
01:15:48,871 --> 01:15:51,710
(Kim Joon Hyun, who was passing by, appears.)

2039
01:15:51,711 --> 01:15:53,141
- You... Hey!
- Hello, Jae Suk.

2040
01:15:53,951 --> 01:15:55,510
(This is so sudden.)

2041
01:15:55,511 --> 01:15:56,880
- Hello.
- You...

2042
01:15:56,881 --> 01:15:58,780
I heard that people were filming a show.

2043
01:15:58,781 --> 01:16:01,451
- Hello.
- It has been a while.

2044
01:16:01,721 --> 01:16:03,420
He plays an instrument.

2045
01:16:03,421 --> 01:16:05,020
Really? Are you here to buy an instrument?

2046
01:16:05,021 --> 01:16:07,490
- He plays the drums.
- I bought one today.

2047
01:16:07,491 --> 01:16:08,830
What did you buy?

2048
01:16:08,831 --> 01:16:10,231
I bought a snare drum.

2049
01:16:10,431 --> 01:16:12,200
- A snare drum.
- You play the drums too.

2050
01:16:12,201 --> 01:16:13,201
Just a little bit.

2051
01:16:13,202 --> 01:16:15,101
- He's a talented drummer.
- A snare drum.

2052
01:16:15,531 --> 01:16:16,771
It was a splurge.

2053
01:16:17,071 --> 01:16:18,541
- How much was it?
- How fascinating.

2054
01:16:22,811 --> 01:16:24,641
I thought you were going somewhere with a lunchbox.

2055
01:16:25,041 --> 01:16:26,080
Is this it?

2056
01:16:26,081 --> 01:16:27,380
(A 2,000-dollar snare drum that's more precious than food)

2057
01:16:27,381 --> 01:16:29,110
You're going home with it?

2058
01:16:29,111 --> 01:16:30,750
- It's Whenever Possible, right?
- Yes.

2059
01:16:30,751 --> 01:16:32,020
My goodness.

2060
01:16:32,021 --> 01:16:34,291
- For real?
- For real?

2061
01:16:36,391 --> 01:16:37,920
- It was nice seeing you.
- Bye.

2062
01:16:37,921 --> 01:16:39,760
- Bye, Joon Hyun.
- Bye, Jae Suk.

2063
01:16:39,761 --> 01:16:41,461
- Bye, Yeon Seok.
- Okay.

2064
01:16:41,661 --> 01:16:43,460
Joon Hyun is cool.

2065
01:16:43,461 --> 01:16:44,500
(See you.)

2066
01:16:44,501 --> 01:16:45,630
- He plays an instrument.
- How fascinating.

2067
01:16:45,631 --> 01:16:47,730
- Joon Hyun is in a band.
- Yes.

2068
01:16:47,731 --> 01:16:49,330
- Yes.
- I saw it on TV.

2069
01:16:49,331 --> 01:16:51,000
- That's right.
- He can play an acoustic guitar.

2070
01:16:51,001 --> 01:16:53,301
- He can sing well.
- He can sing well.

2071
01:16:53,601 --> 01:16:57,011
The thing is, we failed last time.

2072
01:16:57,281 --> 01:16:59,180
- I see.
- We want to do better this time.

2073
01:16:59,181 --> 01:17:00,581
- We must succeed in it.
- Yes.

2074
01:17:01,011 --> 01:17:02,850
(Roll the bonus coupon dice.)

2075
01:17:02,851 --> 01:17:04,221
If we had two earlier...

2076
01:17:05,221 --> 01:17:07,251
(They acquire 1 coupon.)

2077
01:17:07,391 --> 01:17:09,691
- Here comes the Round 1 prize.
- Round 1.

2078
01:17:09,791 --> 01:17:10,961
- Please read it out loud.
- Okay.

2079
01:17:11,061 --> 01:17:13,520
"A weekend dine-out routine for a family of three."

2080
01:17:13,521 --> 01:17:15,361
"You won't get tired of it even if you go every week."

2081
01:17:15,861 --> 01:17:18,830
A 300-dollar gift card for Ashley Queens.

2082
01:17:18,831 --> 01:17:20,200
(A 300-dollar gift card for Ashley Queens, a buffet place!)

2083
01:17:20,201 --> 01:17:21,401
It's so nice.

2084
01:17:21,531 --> 01:17:23,370
You don't have to spend all of it at once, right?

2085
01:17:23,371 --> 01:17:24,371
(Very serious)

2086
01:17:24,372 --> 01:17:26,500
You can use it repeatedly.

2087
01:17:26,501 --> 01:17:27,841
- It's so nice.
- Buffet.

2088
01:17:28,311 --> 01:17:30,340
All right. Let's do well.

2089
01:17:30,341 --> 01:17:31,980
- Okay.
- We're serious about this.

2090
01:17:31,981 --> 01:17:33,310
- What is it?
- What's the game?

2091
01:17:33,311 --> 01:17:34,350
(What's the mission they must succeed in this time?)

2092
01:17:34,351 --> 01:17:36,380
(Sliding Pick)

2093
01:17:36,381 --> 01:17:38,520
(Flick the picks with fingers...)

2094
01:17:38,521 --> 01:17:42,621
(and put 2 in the Goal Zone.)

2095
01:17:42,651 --> 01:17:44,420
- How do we do it?
- In that zone between the lines.

2096
01:17:44,421 --> 01:17:45,761
Oh, between the lines.

2097
01:17:46,061 --> 01:17:47,390
- How...
- This is...

2098
01:17:47,391 --> 01:17:49,790
- We start from here.
- We start from here.

2099
01:17:49,791 --> 01:17:51,100
- In here...
- The picks need to go in.

2100
01:17:51,101 --> 01:17:52,630
- Two people need to succeed in it.
- Two picks need to go in.

2101
01:17:52,631 --> 01:17:54,130
What? That doesn't sound bad.

2102
01:17:54,131 --> 01:17:55,830
Don't you think it's doable?

2103
01:17:55,831 --> 01:17:57,701
I think it's better than basketball.

2104
01:17:57,841 --> 01:17:59,241
- It's better than basketball.
- Yes.

2105
01:17:59,301 --> 01:18:00,301
Let's try it.

2106
01:18:00,302 --> 01:18:01,711
(Practicing)

2107
01:18:01,771 --> 01:18:02,841
It's a practice.

2108
01:18:03,011 --> 01:18:04,011
(Sliding off)

2109
01:18:04,411 --> 01:18:06,480
- You need to control your strength.
- It slides very easily.

2110
01:18:06,481 --> 01:18:08,251
- It slides very easily.
- It's very light.

2111
01:18:09,551 --> 01:18:10,551
(Gently)

2112
01:18:10,551 --> 01:18:11,551
- It's hard.
- It isn't easy.

2113
01:18:11,552 --> 01:18:13,151
- It's hard.
- It isn't easy.

2114
01:18:14,891 --> 01:18:16,020
This is...

2115
01:18:16,021 --> 01:18:17,460
- Even if you flick it gently...
- It's hard.

2116
01:18:17,461 --> 01:18:18,721
Even if you flick it gently, it slides off.

2117
01:18:19,421 --> 01:18:21,290
Have the two of you done something like this?

2118
01:18:21,291 --> 01:18:23,061
- Oh, my. No, we haven't.
- No?

2119
01:18:23,331 --> 01:18:24,630
Hold on. In that case...

2120
01:18:24,631 --> 01:18:25,730
(Of course, they haven't played a game like this.)

2121
01:18:25,731 --> 01:18:26,731
It isn't easy.

2122
01:18:26,732 --> 01:18:29,201
What should I do? I feel like it's harder than basketball.

2123
01:18:29,701 --> 01:18:30,970
(Bad news)

2124
01:18:30,971 --> 01:18:32,601
- Two people need to succeed in it.
- Yes.

2125
01:18:33,641 --> 01:18:34,771
We're in trouble.

2126
01:18:36,741 --> 01:18:38,440
- Why is it so hard?
- Jae Suk,

2127
01:18:38,441 --> 01:18:39,641
it's 2 picks for Round 1.

2128
01:18:40,681 --> 01:18:41,780
My gosh.

2129
01:18:41,781 --> 01:18:43,080
It isn't easy to get two in the zone.

2130
01:18:43,081 --> 01:18:44,221
(They pick flicking the picks.)

2131
01:18:47,051 --> 01:18:48,251
A bit more.

2132
01:18:48,451 --> 01:18:49,621
That was close.

2133
01:18:49,791 --> 01:18:51,291
Suddenly, you get the hang of it.

2134
01:18:51,621 --> 01:18:52,920
- Shall we try it?
- Shall we go?

2135
01:18:52,921 --> 01:18:54,290
- Shall we try Round One?
- Yes.

2136
01:18:54,291 --> 01:18:55,861
(Strumming)

2137
01:18:56,391 --> 01:18:57,461
Then...

2138
01:18:57,831 --> 01:19:00,031
That's right. We need to get the hang of it.

2139
01:19:01,331 --> 01:19:02,471
Okay.

2140
01:19:02,931 --> 01:19:04,701
- I think they'll succeed in it.
- Yes.

2141
01:19:04,801 --> 01:19:06,900
- I think they'll succeed in it.
- Let's do a cheer.

2142
01:19:06,901 --> 01:19:07,910
- Let's do a cheer.
- Okay.

2143
01:19:07,911 --> 01:19:10,040
- One, two, three. Let's go!
- One, two, three. Let's go!

2144
01:19:10,041 --> 01:19:11,110
- Let's go.
- Let's go.

2145
01:19:11,111 --> 01:19:12,281
It's the first try.

2146
01:19:12,941 --> 01:19:14,511
- Shall I go first? Okay.
- Give it a go.

2147
01:19:15,211 --> 01:19:16,250
It'll be nice...

2148
01:19:16,251 --> 01:19:17,920
- if the first try is successful.
- Here I go!

2149
01:19:17,921 --> 01:19:19,020
(First try, Yeon Seok)

2150
01:19:19,021 --> 01:19:20,721
- I did pretty well here earlier.
- Okay.

2151
01:19:21,491 --> 01:19:22,491
From here...

2152
01:19:23,961 --> 01:19:25,061
Like this.

2153
01:19:29,091 --> 01:19:30,190
Like this.

2154
01:19:30,191 --> 01:19:32,730
(It's short.)

2155
01:19:32,731 --> 01:19:34,100
(Dejected)

2156
01:19:34,101 --> 01:19:35,800
- You need to leave it there.
- Really?

2157
01:19:35,801 --> 01:19:37,171
- Do we need to leave it there?
- Yes.

2158
01:19:37,341 --> 01:19:39,300
- Can we hit that pick then?
- You can do that.

2159
01:19:39,301 --> 01:19:40,841
- Are we allowed to do that?
- I see.

2160
01:19:41,141 --> 01:19:42,740
- It might get in the way.
- I obstructed the path...

2161
01:19:42,741 --> 01:19:43,980
by putting it in the middle.

2162
01:19:43,981 --> 01:19:45,510
(First try, Jae Suk)

2163
01:19:45,511 --> 01:19:46,541
Shall I start from the back?

2164
01:19:48,011 --> 01:19:51,321
(Jae Suk came the closest while they were practicing.)

2165
01:19:52,381 --> 01:19:53,381
(Gosh)

2166
01:19:53,851 --> 01:19:54,991
Gosh.

2167
01:19:55,991 --> 01:19:57,760
- I'll give it a go.
- We still have hope.

2168
01:19:57,761 --> 01:19:59,061
We still have two people left.

2169
01:19:59,261 --> 01:20:00,660
- Je Hoon got the hang of it.
- We might succeed in it.

2170
01:20:00,661 --> 01:20:01,730
(The remaining 2 need to succeed in it.)

2171
01:20:01,731 --> 01:20:02,731
(First try, Je Hoon)

2172
01:20:08,671 --> 01:20:09,700
(It's short again.)

2173
01:20:09,701 --> 01:20:11,370
Ye Jin, I'm sorry. I failed.

2174
01:20:11,371 --> 01:20:13,670
- You need to get the hang of it.
- I'll practice.

2175
01:20:13,671 --> 01:20:16,570
- Ye Jin, try to hit a pick.
- Then...

2176
01:20:16,571 --> 01:20:17,740
- Then two will go in.
- Okay.

2177
01:20:17,741 --> 01:20:18,980
- If she does that, - I'll flick hard.

2178
01:20:18,981 --> 01:20:21,611
- it'll make global news.
- Aim to hit another pick.

2179
01:20:23,981 --> 01:20:25,421
(What?)

2180
01:20:26,151 --> 01:20:27,151
What?

2181
01:20:27,151 --> 01:20:28,151
(Failed)

2182
01:20:28,152 --> 01:20:29,421
- It was a nice try.
- Okay.

2183
01:20:29,591 --> 01:20:31,260
- My aim was way off.
- We got the hang of it...

2184
01:20:31,261 --> 01:20:33,220
- during the first try.
- For goodness' sake.

2185
01:20:33,221 --> 01:20:34,461
It's so hard.

2186
01:20:35,191 --> 01:20:36,860
- Why is it so hard?
- Hold on.

2187
01:20:36,861 --> 01:20:38,130
We need 2 picks for Round 1.

2188
01:20:38,131 --> 01:20:39,260
- You know, - Second try.

2189
01:20:39,261 --> 01:20:40,331
I can't get the hang of it.

2190
01:20:43,071 --> 01:20:44,071
It stopped.

2191
01:20:44,541 --> 01:20:45,571
It was great.

2192
01:20:46,441 --> 01:20:48,470
It stopped. You should've done this earlier.

2193
01:20:48,471 --> 01:20:49,740
- Here we go!
- He does well during practice.

2194
01:20:49,741 --> 01:20:52,041
- He does well during practice.
- He does very well.

2195
01:20:52,381 --> 01:20:54,381
I need to flick it this hard. I got the hang of it.

2196
01:20:54,551 --> 01:20:55,951
I need to flick it this hard.

2197
01:20:56,481 --> 01:20:58,681
- With my thumb...
- I shouldn't flick too hard.

2198
01:20:59,251 --> 01:21:00,791
- Ye Jin, your aim is still off.
- Okay.

2199
01:21:01,051 --> 01:21:02,421
- It's okay.
- The middle...

2200
01:21:02,751 --> 01:21:04,061
- I failed.
- Why is it so hard?

2201
01:21:04,291 --> 01:21:06,360
Do the picks have the same weight?

2202
01:21:06,361 --> 01:21:07,491
They can weigh differently.

2203
01:21:08,591 --> 01:21:09,891
It's 1.5mm.

2204
01:21:10,631 --> 01:21:12,200
- They can weigh differently.
- All of these picks are different.

2205
01:21:12,201 --> 01:21:14,901
You're right. The four picks are different.

2206
01:21:16,901 --> 01:21:20,441
(The picks are slightly different in thickness.)

2207
01:21:20,501 --> 01:21:23,240
Then a thick one will give you an advantage.

2208
01:21:23,241 --> 01:21:24,241
You're right.

2209
01:21:24,242 --> 01:21:27,611
These picks feel different when you play the guitar.

2210
01:21:28,311 --> 01:21:29,981
- You did it.
- That was great.

2211
01:21:30,511 --> 01:21:32,351
- You did it.
- That was great.

2212
01:21:32,581 --> 01:21:34,690
- Oh, my. She did it.
- What was that?

2213
01:21:34,691 --> 01:21:36,090
- Let me try again.
- Which pick was it?

2214
01:21:36,091 --> 01:21:38,020
- The heavy one?
- The heaviest one.

2215
01:21:38,021 --> 01:21:39,690
- Okay. I'll use the heaviest one.
- Okay.

2216
01:21:39,691 --> 01:21:41,130
The heavy one is better.

2217
01:21:41,131 --> 01:21:43,060
That's right. If it's too thin...

2218
01:21:43,061 --> 01:21:44,660
- I knew it'd be harder.
- Yes.

2219
01:21:44,661 --> 01:21:45,800
- All right.
- Good.

2220
01:21:45,801 --> 01:21:46,960
- It's in the zone.
- I got the hang of it.

2221
01:21:46,961 --> 01:21:48,400
- There you go.
- Let's go.

2222
01:21:48,401 --> 01:21:49,530
- Shall we give it a go?
- Here we go!

2223
01:21:49,531 --> 01:21:51,170
- Let's go.
- Here we go!

2224
01:21:51,171 --> 01:21:52,801
- The second try.
- Let's go.

2225
01:21:53,001 --> 01:21:54,610
Let's reach Round Three this time.

2226
01:21:54,611 --> 01:21:55,870
One, two, three.

2227
01:21:55,871 --> 01:21:56,911
- Here we go!
- Here we go!

2228
01:21:57,171 --> 01:21:58,540
- The 2 of you can go 1st.
- Okay.

2229
01:21:58,541 --> 01:21:59,611
- Okay.
- Je Hoon.

2230
01:21:59,741 --> 01:22:01,210
- Then the two of you can go.
- Okay.

2231
01:22:01,211 --> 01:22:02,380
You did well earlier.

2232
01:22:02,381 --> 01:22:03,881
(Second try, Je Hoon)

2233
01:22:09,621 --> 01:22:10,721
(It went in!)

2234
01:22:11,591 --> 01:22:13,161
(Very proud)

2235
01:22:13,461 --> 01:22:14,660
(Kim Do Gi got the hang of it.)

2236
01:22:14,661 --> 01:22:15,661
Let's succeed in it.

2237
01:22:15,662 --> 01:22:16,890
- Ye Jin.
- Well done.

2238
01:22:16,891 --> 01:22:18,861
- Ye Jin.
- Good.

2239
01:22:20,731 --> 01:22:22,170
(A quick exit)

2240
01:22:22,171 --> 01:22:23,201
Okay.

2241
01:22:23,771 --> 01:22:25,041
We can do it.

2242
01:22:25,271 --> 01:22:26,341
- All right.
- One more person.

2243
01:22:27,001 --> 01:22:30,071
(Second try, Jae Suk)

2244
01:22:30,741 --> 01:22:31,781
Don't get intimidated.

2245
01:22:34,451 --> 01:22:35,680
(Gosh)

2246
01:22:35,681 --> 01:22:37,581
- You got a bit intimidated.
- You can hit mine.

2247
01:22:37,681 --> 01:22:38,751
Hold on.

2248
01:22:38,881 --> 01:22:40,650
(Second try, Yeon Seok)

2249
01:22:40,651 --> 01:22:41,950
- Hold on.
- We can do it.

2250
01:22:41,951 --> 01:22:43,451
- I succeeded in it earlier.
- All right.

2251
01:22:43,751 --> 01:22:46,661
(If Yeon Seok gets it in the zone, they'll succeed in Round 1.)

2252
01:22:48,591 --> 01:22:50,131
- From here...
- That's right.

2253
01:22:50,291 --> 01:22:51,800
- From here... Earlier, - You never know.

2254
01:22:51,801 --> 01:22:53,631
- I did it from here.
- That's right.

2255
01:22:54,031 --> 01:22:55,701
Don't think too much.

2256
01:22:59,341 --> 01:23:01,540
- Don't think too much. Flick it.
- I was about to go, okay?

2257
01:23:01,541 --> 01:23:03,611
- Don't say that.
- Don't think too much.

2258
01:23:03,711 --> 01:23:05,110
Go.

2259
01:23:05,111 --> 01:23:06,381
Go.

2260
01:23:08,481 --> 01:23:09,650
(He calms his breath once more.)

2261
01:23:09,651 --> 01:23:10,811
You can do it.

2262
01:23:11,881 --> 01:23:13,451
Flick.

2263
01:23:14,591 --> 01:23:15,591
Flick.

2264
01:23:15,592 --> 01:23:17,021
That's it!

2265
01:23:18,561 --> 01:23:21,461
(Yeon Seok did it!)

2266
01:23:21,531 --> 01:23:22,961
That's it!

2267
01:23:23,191 --> 01:23:25,000
(Well done.)

2268
01:23:25,001 --> 01:23:27,060
- That was great.
- Well done.

2269
01:23:27,061 --> 01:23:28,430
- Well done.
- My goodness.

2270
01:23:28,431 --> 01:23:30,330
- Round One is a success.
- A success.

2271
01:23:30,331 --> 01:23:31,401
Good.

2272
01:23:31,901 --> 01:23:33,571
We did it in two tries.

2273
01:23:34,341 --> 01:23:35,471
It was very clean.

2274
01:23:35,811 --> 01:23:36,970
- It was very clean.
- Je Hoon.

2275
01:23:36,971 --> 01:23:38,540
- It was great.
- Well done.

2276
01:23:38,541 --> 01:23:39,840
It was very clean.

2277
01:23:39,841 --> 01:23:41,281
- Well done.
- My goodness.

2278
01:23:41,381 --> 01:23:42,511
- Seriously.
- I like it.

2279
01:23:43,281 --> 01:23:46,580
You've acquired the Round One prize,

2280
01:23:46,581 --> 01:23:48,391
- the gift card.
- Okay.

2281
01:23:48,651 --> 01:23:52,291
Now, please decide whether to keep going or stop.

2282
01:23:52,521 --> 01:23:54,490
- We do have many remaining tries...
- We have many tries.

2283
01:23:54,491 --> 01:23:55,960
- right now.
- You're right.

2284
01:23:55,961 --> 01:23:57,730
Will you keep going or stop?

2285
01:23:57,731 --> 01:23:59,330
- One, two, three.
- Keep going.

2286
01:23:59,331 --> 01:24:00,461
Okay.

2287
01:24:00,831 --> 01:24:02,200
We have a good feeling about this.

2288
01:24:02,201 --> 01:24:03,770
- The second one.
- Let's go.

2289
01:24:03,771 --> 01:24:05,200
(They quickly decided to keep going. What's the second prize?)

2290
01:24:05,201 --> 01:24:06,541
- Please read it out loud.
- Okay.

2291
01:24:09,341 --> 01:24:11,680
"It's an item for the ponytail..."

2292
01:24:11,681 --> 01:24:13,711
"that takes you an hour to prepare every day."

2293
01:24:14,211 --> 01:24:15,481
Dyson Airwrap.

2294
01:24:15,551 --> 01:24:16,781
(Cheering)

2295
01:24:16,851 --> 01:24:18,851
- We should win it for him.
- It's a nice prize.

2296
01:24:18,981 --> 01:24:21,450
- Will it save me time?
- Gosh, it's here.

2297
01:24:21,451 --> 01:24:22,550
My goodness.

2298
01:24:22,551 --> 01:24:23,950
- This is...
- We should win it for him.

2299
01:24:23,951 --> 01:24:24,991
It's mine.

2300
01:24:25,121 --> 01:24:27,260
- It'll be great.
- You know,

2301
01:24:27,261 --> 01:24:29,990
- it's for Yu Jin too.
- Yu Jin keeps sighing.

2302
01:24:29,991 --> 01:24:31,960
- He said, "It's mine."
- It's mine.

2303
01:24:31,961 --> 01:24:33,701
- I want to give it to him.
- It's a nice item.

2304
01:24:33,861 --> 01:24:34,970
- I bet he'll love it.
- We should win it for him.

2305
01:24:34,971 --> 01:24:36,100
- Your face lit up.
- Please.

2306
01:24:36,101 --> 01:24:38,471
Thank you. I don't feel nervous anymore.

2307
01:24:38,941 --> 01:24:40,200
(Round 2)

2308
01:24:40,201 --> 01:24:42,241
(Smaller Goal Zone)

2309
01:24:42,471 --> 01:24:44,410
- What are we going to do?
- In there?

2310
01:24:44,411 --> 01:24:47,110
- In there?
- The length is the same.

2311
01:24:47,111 --> 01:24:49,380
- I see.
- The zone is smaller.

2312
01:24:49,381 --> 01:24:51,320
Two people need to succeed in it while the zone is smaller.

2313
01:24:51,321 --> 01:24:52,550
I think we can ignore it.

2314
01:24:52,551 --> 01:24:54,690
- The picks went into that zone.
- Okay.

2315
01:24:54,691 --> 01:24:56,550
- In 1, 2, 3. Here we go!
- In 1, 2, 3. Here we go!

2316
01:24:56,551 --> 01:24:57,790
(Out of 10 total tries, they're on try number 3.)

2317
01:24:57,791 --> 01:24:59,461
I'll go first.

2318
01:24:59,521 --> 01:25:02,160
Je Hoon. You've done well today.

2319
01:25:02,161 --> 01:25:03,291
He's good at things.

2320
01:25:05,931 --> 01:25:07,561
(It's goes in again!)

2321
01:25:09,901 --> 01:25:10,901
You...

2322
01:25:11,901 --> 01:25:12,901
You...

2323
01:25:12,902 --> 01:25:13,971
- We got this.
- Je Hoon.

2324
01:25:14,411 --> 01:25:15,810
- Hey.
- We got this.

2325
01:25:15,811 --> 01:25:18,140
- Seriously.
- Just one more person. Let's go.

2326
01:25:18,141 --> 01:25:19,180
- I'll go next.
- Okay.

2327
01:25:19,181 --> 01:25:20,380
- I'll go next.
- You're good at this,

2328
01:25:20,381 --> 01:25:21,911
- I'll go next.
- so you can go first.

2329
01:25:22,181 --> 01:25:23,310
- Oh, no.
- Do it the same way as before.

2330
01:25:23,311 --> 01:25:26,481
We're doing incredibly well today.

2331
01:25:26,581 --> 01:25:28,190
This is the spot.

2332
01:25:28,191 --> 01:25:29,690
You figured it out, right?

2333
01:25:29,691 --> 01:25:30,691
I figured it out.

2334
01:25:31,491 --> 01:25:32,491
All right.

2335
01:25:32,921 --> 01:25:33,990
Flick.

2336
01:25:33,991 --> 01:25:35,531
(If Yeon Seok puts it in the zone, they'll succeed in Round 2.)

2337
01:25:36,231 --> 01:25:37,900
- What will we do if it goes in?
- I think it'll go in.

2338
01:25:37,901 --> 01:25:39,300
- If it goes in...
- I think it'll go in.

2339
01:25:39,301 --> 01:25:41,401
- I think it'll go in.
- I think it'll go in. Right now...

2340
01:25:41,531 --> 01:25:42,701
Flick. I got the hang of it.

2341
01:25:43,201 --> 01:25:44,701
You got the hang of it, Yeon Seok.

2342
01:25:44,901 --> 01:25:45,901
Don't think.

2343
01:25:52,381 --> 01:25:53,680
(He actually got the hang of it!)

2344
01:25:53,681 --> 01:25:54,681
Flick.

2345
01:25:55,811 --> 01:25:56,880
Yeon Seok.

2346
01:25:56,881 --> 01:26:01,091
(I told you that I got the hang of it, didn't I?)

2347
01:26:01,821 --> 01:26:03,090
- My goodness.
- That's right.

2348
01:26:03,091 --> 01:26:05,491
- No way.
- You got the hang of it.

2349
01:26:06,261 --> 01:26:09,161
- You got the hang of it.
- My goodness.

2350
01:26:09,831 --> 01:26:11,701
Je Hoon and Yeon Seok are on fire.

2351
01:26:13,931 --> 01:26:17,770
(The 84 Duo's picks went into the zone with precision.)

2352
01:26:17,771 --> 01:26:19,571
The 84 Duo.

2353
01:26:19,871 --> 01:26:21,941
We're making up for our bad performance...

2354
01:26:22,371 --> 01:26:23,710
- in basketball.
- Seriously.

2355
01:26:23,711 --> 01:26:25,811
- Round Two is a success.
- A success.

2356
01:26:26,781 --> 01:26:29,110
- So many tries remain.
- You know,

2357
01:26:29,111 --> 01:26:30,550
eight tries remain.

2358
01:26:30,551 --> 01:26:32,181
- My goodness.
- The prize will be bigger.

2359
01:26:32,221 --> 01:26:33,621
What will be the next prize?

2360
01:26:34,351 --> 01:26:35,951
Will you keep going or stop?

2361
01:26:36,451 --> 01:26:38,020
One, two, three.

2362
01:26:38,021 --> 01:26:39,091
- Keep going.
- Keep going.

2363
01:26:39,361 --> 01:26:40,690
- We have to keep going.
- Yes.

2364
01:26:40,691 --> 01:26:41,790
- We have to.
- So many tries remain.

2365
01:26:41,791 --> 01:26:43,590
- We believe in you.
- We have to keep going.

2366
01:26:43,591 --> 01:26:45,361
- Now comes Round Three.
- Today...

2367
01:26:45,461 --> 01:26:46,560
- I've never seen...
- What is it?

2368
01:26:46,561 --> 01:26:47,601
such big fortune cookies.

2369
01:26:47,971 --> 01:26:49,431
- Please read it out loud.
- What is it?

2370
01:26:52,171 --> 01:26:53,941
- What is it? He loves it.
- Yes.

2371
01:26:54,171 --> 01:26:55,511
"We work six days a week,"

2372
01:26:55,711 --> 01:26:58,411
"so we want to enjoy our day off with our daughter."

2373
01:26:58,741 --> 01:27:00,611
PlayStation Five Pro.

2374
01:27:01,111 --> 01:27:02,151
(Cheering)

2375
01:27:03,011 --> 01:27:05,120
- I'll need to dance.
- This is insane.

2376
01:27:05,121 --> 01:27:06,551
- My goodness.
- My goodness.

2377
01:27:06,951 --> 01:27:08,191
- Pro.
- But...

2378
01:27:08,421 --> 01:27:11,091
- This is...
- Only Jeong Il keeps being happy.

2379
01:27:11,821 --> 01:27:13,991
I've dreamed of it since our newlywed days.

2380
01:27:14,291 --> 01:27:15,590
- Really?
- Yes.

2381
01:27:15,591 --> 01:27:17,430
- So...
- I didn't allow him to buy it.

2382
01:27:17,431 --> 01:27:18,600
- You didn't allow him to buy it.
- Really?

2383
01:27:18,601 --> 01:27:20,300
- Yes.
- I have one at home.

2384
01:27:20,301 --> 01:27:22,101
There are various games.

2385
01:27:22,801 --> 01:27:24,331
Please win it.

2386
01:27:24,771 --> 01:27:25,940
(Round 3)

2387
01:27:25,941 --> 01:27:27,871
(Even smaller Goal Zone)

2388
01:27:28,541 --> 01:27:29,710
I see.

2389
01:27:29,711 --> 01:27:31,480
- It's too small.
- It'll be a bit hard.

2390
01:27:31,481 --> 01:27:33,140
- It's at the edge.
- Okay.

2391
01:27:33,141 --> 01:27:34,910
- I thought it was at the front.
- This won't be easy.

2392
01:27:34,911 --> 01:27:36,281
This is...

2393
01:27:36,711 --> 01:27:38,850
It was too strong. I should flick more gently.

2394
01:27:38,851 --> 01:27:40,080
Do you use the thickest pick?

2395
01:27:40,081 --> 01:27:41,391
Yes, I use the thickest pick.

2396
01:27:41,591 --> 01:27:43,291
What are we, experts?

2397
01:27:44,021 --> 01:27:45,260
"Do you use the thickest pick?"

2398
01:27:45,261 --> 01:27:46,960
(They sound like expert gamers.)

2399
01:27:46,961 --> 01:27:49,060
- It's like a golf club number.
- Yes.

2400
01:27:49,061 --> 01:27:50,460
- Which pick do you use?
- It's a 1.50mm pick.

2401
01:27:50,461 --> 01:27:51,730
Do you use a 1.50mm pick?

2402
01:27:51,731 --> 01:27:53,160
- Do you use a 1.50mm pick?
- I do too.

2403
01:27:53,161 --> 01:27:54,871
- Do you use a 1.50mm pick?
- Yes.

2404
01:27:55,771 --> 01:27:57,201
- I think it's doable.
- Yes.

2405
01:27:57,801 --> 01:27:59,340
The older members are doing so well.

2406
01:27:59,341 --> 01:28:01,371
- Je Hoon and Yeon Seok are on fire.
- I know.

2407
01:28:01,871 --> 01:28:04,110
It's the fourth try. In 1, 2, 3.

2408
01:28:04,111 --> 01:28:05,111
- Here we go!
- Here we go!

2409
01:28:05,681 --> 01:28:07,041
- Shall I go first?
- Go ahead.

2410
01:28:07,851 --> 01:28:09,910
(Fourth try, Jae Suk)

2411
01:28:09,911 --> 01:28:11,420
Let me try to remember what I did earlier.

2412
01:28:11,421 --> 01:28:14,721
(Will they continue to succeed in the mission?)

2413
01:28:18,861 --> 01:28:20,120
(He flicked too hard.)

2414
01:28:20,121 --> 01:28:21,391
The direction was good.

2415
01:28:21,691 --> 01:28:22,760
(Fourth try, Je Hoon)

2416
01:28:22,761 --> 01:28:24,731
(The ace enters.)

2417
01:28:25,601 --> 01:28:28,701
I think Je Hoon will succeed in it.

2418
01:28:29,431 --> 01:28:31,271
- There's nothing he can't do.
- I know.

2419
01:28:31,441 --> 01:28:33,570
When he played basketball, his form was bad. Still...

2420
01:28:33,571 --> 01:28:35,171
(They look forward to Je Hoon's turn.)

2421
01:28:37,771 --> 01:28:39,080
(Sighing)

2422
01:28:39,081 --> 01:28:40,381
- I'm sorry.
- Oh, no.

2423
01:28:41,211 --> 01:28:43,880
The small Goal Zone puts more pressure on me.

2424
01:28:43,881 --> 01:28:45,180
It puts more pressure on you.

2425
01:28:45,181 --> 01:28:47,320
(Round 3 is pressuring.)

2426
01:28:47,321 --> 01:28:49,090
- Shall I go next?
- Okay.

2427
01:28:49,091 --> 01:28:50,390
(Fourth try, Yeon Seok)

2428
01:28:50,391 --> 01:28:52,390
Let's put one pick in there and see what happens.

2429
01:28:52,391 --> 01:28:54,420
- Okay. Put yourself at ease.
- Okay.

2430
01:28:54,421 --> 01:28:55,931
This is the spot.

2431
01:28:59,231 --> 01:29:00,301
Flick.

2432
01:29:03,831 --> 01:29:05,270
- It's in, right?
- It's in.

2433
01:29:05,271 --> 01:29:06,701
- It's in.
- Well done.

2434
01:29:06,841 --> 01:29:08,440
- Ye Jin.
- Let's finish it cleanly.

2435
01:29:08,441 --> 01:29:10,070
Yeon Seok is on a lucky streak.

2436
01:29:10,071 --> 01:29:12,140
- He's on a lucky streak.
- He's on a lucky streak.

2437
01:29:12,141 --> 01:29:15,151
- It's like A720.
- I see.

2438
01:29:15,251 --> 01:29:17,181
Yeon Seok is on a lucky streak.

2439
01:29:18,051 --> 01:29:20,751
- That's Round Three.
- Ye Jin.

2440
01:29:21,651 --> 01:29:22,990
- Ye Jin.
- Yes?

2441
01:29:22,991 --> 01:29:24,020
- Do it with confidence.
- Yes.

2442
01:29:24,021 --> 01:29:25,491
After all, many tries remain.

2443
01:29:25,591 --> 01:29:26,891
- That's right.
- Put yourself at ease.

2444
01:29:27,621 --> 01:29:28,890
That's right. We can try again.

2445
01:29:28,891 --> 01:29:30,661
- Yes, we can try again.
- We can try again.

2446
01:29:31,161 --> 01:29:32,501
- I'll put it in the middle.
- Okay.

2447
01:29:32,731 --> 01:29:34,730
- Now is the time.
- Don't think too much.

2448
01:29:34,731 --> 01:29:35,731
(They can try again, but this is a great chance.)

2449
01:29:37,231 --> 01:29:38,270
(Sighing)

2450
01:29:38,271 --> 01:29:40,141
- May I go again?
- No.

2451
01:29:40,301 --> 01:29:42,341
- No?
- You went already.

2452
01:29:42,711 --> 01:29:44,341
(Chuckling)

2453
01:29:45,381 --> 01:29:46,511
It's too bad.

2454
01:29:46,581 --> 01:29:48,010
All right.

2455
01:29:48,011 --> 01:29:49,210
- Okay.
- Okay.

2456
01:29:49,211 --> 01:29:50,681
It's okay.

2457
01:29:50,911 --> 01:29:52,881
I need to find the right pick.

2458
01:29:53,581 --> 01:29:55,220
So, shall we go?

2459
01:29:55,221 --> 01:29:56,950
Shall we go? Let's go.

2460
01:29:56,951 --> 01:29:57,960
(They begin to get more nervous.)

2461
01:29:57,961 --> 01:29:59,721
- My goodness.
- We can do it.

2462
01:29:59,921 --> 01:30:00,991
We can do it.

2463
01:30:01,591 --> 01:30:03,560
- This is the 6th try.
- In 1, 2, 3.

2464
01:30:03,561 --> 01:30:04,561
- Here we go!
- Here we go!

2465
01:30:04,562 --> 01:30:06,060
(Out of 10 total tries, they're on try number 6.)

2466
01:30:06,061 --> 01:30:07,201
(You go first.)

2467
01:30:07,401 --> 01:30:08,571
- I'll go first.
- Okay.

2468
01:30:09,301 --> 01:30:10,330
Je Hoon.

2469
01:30:10,331 --> 01:30:12,801
(Sixth try, Je Hoon)

2470
01:30:12,871 --> 01:30:13,941
Je Hoon is good at games.

2471
01:30:16,171 --> 01:30:17,171
It's in!

2472
01:30:18,881 --> 01:30:19,911
It's in!

2473
01:30:20,211 --> 01:30:21,910
(The ace is back.)

2474
01:30:21,911 --> 01:30:23,410
(He's the coolest.)

2475
01:30:23,411 --> 01:30:25,081
- Let's go.
- How did that happen?

2476
01:30:25,221 --> 01:30:27,350
(Tearing up)

2477
01:30:27,351 --> 01:30:28,551
- All right.
- That was incredible.

2478
01:30:28,791 --> 01:30:29,891
Let's hurry up and win it for him.

2479
01:30:30,191 --> 01:30:31,191
Okay.

2480
01:30:32,721 --> 01:30:33,890
I'll go last.

2481
01:30:33,891 --> 01:30:35,931
(Sixth try, Jae Suk)

2482
01:30:36,691 --> 01:30:37,830
- Let's finish it.
- All right.

2483
01:30:37,831 --> 01:30:39,000
If you push Je Hoon's pick, it's out.

2484
01:30:39,001 --> 01:30:40,801
I know that already. Why are you...

2485
01:30:41,231 --> 01:30:42,630
Why are you saying that so suddenly?

2486
01:30:42,631 --> 01:30:43,731
(Glaring)

2487
01:30:48,711 --> 01:30:50,270
(He flicked too hard.)

2488
01:30:50,271 --> 01:30:51,540
I thought it'd go in.

2489
01:30:51,541 --> 01:30:53,740
Yeon Shik will put it in the zone anyway.

2490
01:30:53,741 --> 01:30:55,211
That's right. We have Yeon Shik.

2491
01:30:55,451 --> 01:30:56,950
- I'll try to put it there.
- Okay.

2492
01:30:56,951 --> 01:30:59,120
- Ye Jin. You can put it in there.
- Yes?

2493
01:30:59,121 --> 01:31:00,680
- Use your experience from earlier.
- That's right.

2494
01:31:00,681 --> 01:31:02,420
- Put your elbows on the table.
- That's right.

2495
01:31:02,421 --> 01:31:03,490
Let's increase our chances.

2496
01:31:03,491 --> 01:31:04,990
- I might fail.
- You never know.

2497
01:31:04,991 --> 01:31:06,360
Ye Jin, you never know.

2498
01:31:06,361 --> 01:31:08,160
- Put it down.
- Put it down.

2499
01:31:08,161 --> 01:31:09,730
Flick a bit harder than you think.

2500
01:31:09,731 --> 01:31:11,561
- Flick harder than you think.
- Yes. A bit harder.

2501
01:31:15,615 --> 01:31:16,815
- I thought it'd go in.
- Well done.

2502
01:31:17,715 --> 01:31:18,985
You did so well.

2503
01:31:19,725 --> 01:31:22,124
This is bad.

2504
01:31:22,125 --> 01:31:23,194
(The only remaining member is Yeon Seok.)

2505
01:31:23,195 --> 01:31:24,195
Yeon Shik.

2506
01:31:24,196 --> 01:31:25,724
- You can do it.
- Yeon Shik.

2507
01:31:25,725 --> 01:31:26,725
(Sixth try, Yeon Seok)

2508
01:31:26,726 --> 01:31:28,165
- You can do it.
- Yeon Shik.

2509
01:31:28,335 --> 01:31:29,435
(The spirit of the guitar picks)

2510
01:31:30,335 --> 01:31:31,505
- Let's go.
- A 1.50mm pick.

2511
01:31:31,735 --> 01:31:33,004
- A 1.50mm pick.
- He'll do it.

2512
01:31:33,005 --> 01:31:34,264
- He'll succeed in Round Three.
- He'll do it.

2513
01:31:34,265 --> 01:31:35,674
- He'll do it.
- Let's go.

2514
01:31:35,675 --> 01:31:37,105
- Let's go.
- I know how it works.

2515
01:31:37,605 --> 01:31:38,944
I think it'll be okay.

2516
01:31:38,945 --> 01:31:40,245
- I think you'll succeed in it.
- I think he'll do it.

2517
01:31:40,875 --> 01:31:42,074
- I'll finish it off.
- Okay.

2518
01:31:42,075 --> 01:31:43,215
I saw it in my dream.

2519
01:31:45,815 --> 01:31:46,885
Here I go.

2520
01:31:48,815 --> 01:31:49,885
Flick.

2521
01:31:50,715 --> 01:31:51,885
I saw it in my dream.

2522
01:31:52,385 --> 01:31:53,525
Let's create a legend.

2523
01:31:54,055 --> 01:31:55,295
I think he'll do it.

2524
01:31:56,195 --> 01:31:57,295
Flick.

2525
01:32:02,635 --> 01:32:05,265
(Yeon Seok finished it.)

2526
01:32:05,935 --> 01:32:08,935
(Oh, my goodness)

2527
01:32:09,835 --> 01:32:12,705
(This is a paradise.)

2528
01:32:14,175 --> 01:32:15,775
(Cheering)

2529
01:32:17,245 --> 01:32:18,644
(It's more electrifying than any metal songs.)

2530
01:32:18,645 --> 01:32:21,114
- The atmosphere is so heated.
- My goodness.

2531
01:32:21,115 --> 01:32:22,215
It was incredible.

2532
01:32:22,385 --> 01:32:25,185
- You did so well.
- We made this moment together.

2533
01:32:25,925 --> 01:32:27,425
- We did it.
- It was incredible.

2534
01:32:27,585 --> 01:32:28,655
- Seriously.
- Gosh.

2535
01:32:28,855 --> 01:32:30,355
It was incredible.

2536
01:32:31,025 --> 01:32:32,165
- I'm so happy.
- Hey.

2537
01:32:32,265 --> 01:32:34,735
- Round Three is a success.
- A success.

2538
01:32:35,735 --> 01:32:38,804
- Gosh, they won PlayStation too.
- Je Hoon contributed a lot.

2539
01:32:38,805 --> 01:32:39,905
Seriously.

2540
01:32:40,035 --> 01:32:42,934
- Airwrap.
- Yeon Shik and Je Hoon did it.

2541
01:32:42,935 --> 01:32:44,304
- Gift card.
- You did all the work.

2542
01:32:44,305 --> 01:32:45,404
The friends of the same age.

2543
01:32:45,405 --> 01:32:47,144
(The 84 Duo did all the work.)

2544
01:32:47,145 --> 01:32:48,975
- The revolt of those born in 1984.
- That's right.

2545
01:32:49,115 --> 01:32:51,045
This is for everyone in the nation who was born in 1984.

2546
01:32:51,385 --> 01:32:52,885
- Cross!
- Cross!

2547
01:32:53,215 --> 01:32:55,855
We'll give them the prizes for Rounds 1, 2, and 3.

2548
01:32:59,885 --> 01:33:02,355
(Next week)

2549
01:33:03,355 --> 01:33:06,295
(Choo Young Woo)

2550
01:33:06,565 --> 01:33:09,735
(Shin Si A)

2551
01:33:17,805 --> 01:33:19,304
(A heart-fluttering story...)

2552
01:33:19,305 --> 01:33:21,345
(that happened on Christmas...)

2553
01:33:21,845 --> 01:33:27,815
(starring Jae Suk, Yeon Seok, Young Woo, and Si A)

2554
01:33:27,915 --> 01:33:29,385
(It's Christmas.)

2555
01:33:29,615 --> 01:33:30,915
(What should we do?)

2556
01:33:31,015 --> 01:33:32,525
(We need to give them presents!)

2557
01:33:32,785 --> 01:33:34,024
(Come to your senses!)

2558
01:33:34,025 --> 01:33:36,655
(Instead of coming to their senses, they become nervous.)

2559
01:33:37,025 --> 01:33:38,064
(Sighing)

2560
01:33:38,065 --> 01:33:40,064
(I do very well when I practice.)

2561
01:33:40,065 --> 01:33:41,065
(But when the actual game begins...)

2562
01:33:41,066 --> 01:33:42,265
(I'm like that.)

2563
01:33:42,465 --> 01:33:44,394
(We introduce a way to fight nervousness.)

2564
01:33:44,395 --> 01:33:45,664
(Number one:)

2565
01:33:45,665 --> 01:33:50,905
(Avert a crisis with good looks.)

2566
01:33:51,005 --> 01:33:53,204
(It's okay because you're handsome.)

2567
01:33:53,205 --> 01:33:55,245
(You can't do that, Jae Suk!)

2568
01:33:55,515 --> 01:33:57,014
(But there are exceptions.)

2569
01:33:57,015 --> 01:33:58,184
Get ready.

2570
01:33:58,185 --> 01:34:01,815
(Number two: Practice to make yourself less nervous.)

2571
01:34:01,915 --> 01:34:04,285
(But it's different for everyone.)

2572
01:34:04,415 --> 01:34:05,985
(Please wait.)

2573
01:34:06,085 --> 01:34:07,324
(Number three:)

2574
01:34:07,325 --> 01:34:10,995
(Push forward with craziness.)

2575
01:34:11,355 --> 01:34:13,664
(Will there be...)

2576
01:34:13,665 --> 01:34:17,195
(a Christmas miracle?)

2577
01:34:17,295 --> 01:34:19,735
(Whenever Possible 4)
