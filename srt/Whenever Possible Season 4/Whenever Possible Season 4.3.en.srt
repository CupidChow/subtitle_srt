1
00:00:06,406 --> 00:00:08,106
It's already the new year.

2
00:00:08,246 --> 00:00:10,316
- It's the Year of the Red Horse.
- Oh, my.

3
00:00:10,476 --> 00:00:12,445
Dear our beloved viewers,

4
00:00:12,446 --> 00:00:14,315
- happy New Year.
- Happy New Year.

5
00:00:14,316 --> 00:00:16,256
- The new year has dawned.
- Yes.

6
00:00:16,656 --> 00:00:18,655
- It's the Year of the Red Horse.
- The Year of the Red Horse.

7
00:00:18,656 --> 00:00:21,126
- It's the Year of the Horse.
- It is.

8
00:00:21,686 --> 00:00:23,225
It doesn't matter for you, right? It's not your year, is it?

9
00:00:23,226 --> 00:00:24,355
I was born in the Year of the Rat.

10
00:00:24,356 --> 00:00:26,225
- You were born in 1984, right?
- Yes. What about you?

11
00:00:26,226 --> 00:00:28,266
I was born in the Year of the Rat too, but in 1972.

12
00:00:28,866 --> 00:00:30,866
- Rats are our zodiac animal.
- Yes, that's right.

13
00:00:30,996 --> 00:00:31,996
My gosh.

14
00:00:32,766 --> 00:00:34,466
- So...
- You have a rat-like face.

15
00:00:34,966 --> 00:00:36,236
A rat-like face?

16
00:00:36,506 --> 00:00:38,575
- You...
- Of all people, you can't say that.

17
00:00:38,576 --> 00:00:40,175
You know what? When I saw you earlier, I thought...

18
00:00:40,176 --> 00:00:41,775
- you had a rat-like face.
- What are you talking about?

19
00:00:41,776 --> 00:00:43,146
What time were you born?

20
00:00:43,646 --> 00:00:45,346
I was born in the morning.

21
00:00:45,516 --> 00:00:48,485
I was born early in the morning.

22
00:00:48,486 --> 00:00:50,315
People born early in the morning in the Year of the Rat...

23
00:00:50,316 --> 00:00:52,086
- Yes? I see.
- have such a busy life.

24
00:00:52,156 --> 00:00:54,855
Rats go around early in the morning.

25
00:00:54,856 --> 00:00:56,325
They're early risers.

26
00:00:56,326 --> 00:00:58,656
But that's how they usually end up in rat traps.

27
00:00:59,526 --> 00:01:01,525
- My gosh.
- People...

28
00:01:01,526 --> 00:01:03,595
- Why bring that up in the new year?
- So listen.

29
00:01:03,596 --> 00:01:05,135
- You should say something nice.
- Listen.

30
00:01:05,136 --> 00:01:07,935
- I'm telling you to be careful.
- Hold on. What?

31
00:01:07,936 --> 00:01:09,416
Don't go around early in the morning.

32
00:01:09,506 --> 00:01:10,536
- Got it?
- Come on.

33
00:01:11,936 --> 00:01:14,205
Then do you want to check your fortune for the new year?

34
00:01:14,206 --> 00:01:15,246
For today?

35
00:01:15,306 --> 00:01:16,516
- Let's check it.
- Okay.

36
00:01:17,146 --> 00:01:20,286
But how are you checking my fortune? Did you download an app?

37
00:01:20,486 --> 00:01:22,585
- I'm using AI.
- I see. ChatGPT.

38
00:01:22,586 --> 00:01:23,985
Do you still pay for the service?

39
00:01:23,986 --> 00:01:25,556
- Of course.
- I see.

40
00:01:25,756 --> 00:01:27,855
How's my fortune for the day? Good?

41
00:01:27,856 --> 00:01:29,125
"You will shine not in the spotlight,"

42
00:01:29,126 --> 00:01:31,996
"but behind the scene while pulling everything together."

43
00:01:32,996 --> 00:01:34,796
It sounds like I'll shine in today's episode.

44
00:01:35,296 --> 00:01:36,396
But it also says...

45
00:01:36,496 --> 00:01:38,495
"Results will be better by keeping things centered..."

46
00:01:38,496 --> 00:01:40,936
"rather than trying to stand out as the leader."

47
00:01:41,636 --> 00:01:44,606
- So you should keep a low profile.
- I shouldn't overdo it.

48
00:01:44,876 --> 00:01:46,606
- Okay.
- I see.

49
00:01:46,806 --> 00:01:49,366
Actually, personality-wise, I don't like to be in the spotlight.

50
00:01:49,416 --> 00:01:50,815
But you like drawing attention.

51
00:01:50,816 --> 00:01:52,075
What are you talking about?

52
00:01:52,076 --> 00:01:53,646
Come on, it's the new year.

53
00:01:53,746 --> 00:01:55,685
- You like to draw attention.
- Wait.

54
00:01:55,686 --> 00:01:57,615
- Check yours.
- Okay. Let's see.

55
00:01:57,616 --> 00:01:59,425
"If you make a move, you will get good results."

56
00:01:59,426 --> 00:02:01,585
"If you hesitate, you'll lose the opportunity."

57
00:02:01,586 --> 00:02:03,596
Okay. "It's more advantageous for you..."

58
00:02:03,756 --> 00:02:05,555
"to carry out what you've been preparing."

59
00:02:05,556 --> 00:02:06,996
- Okay.
- I see.

60
00:02:07,396 --> 00:02:09,872
The interpretations aren't as good, given that you pay for the service.

61
00:02:09,896 --> 00:02:11,235
- What?
- You know what?

62
00:02:11,236 --> 00:02:13,336
- This is...
- It should give us clearer answers.

63
00:02:13,436 --> 00:02:16,036
It told me to keep things centered instead of overdoing things.

64
00:02:16,436 --> 00:02:17,636
Why don't you use yours?

65
00:02:17,836 --> 00:02:18,876
Gemini?

66
00:02:19,406 --> 00:02:21,076
But it's not a paid version.

67
00:02:23,516 --> 00:02:26,786
Tell me about the compatibility of Yoo Yeon Seok and Yoo Jae Suk.

68
00:02:27,816 --> 00:02:29,285
It's hard to find information...

69
00:02:29,286 --> 00:02:31,446
on the compatibility of Yoo Yeon Seok and Yoo Jae Suk.

70
00:02:32,116 --> 00:02:33,785
Jae Suk, you should get the paid version.

71
00:02:33,786 --> 00:02:36,496
Hey, you know what? You won't give me clear answers...

72
00:02:36,696 --> 00:02:38,325
because I have a free version.

73
00:02:38,326 --> 00:02:40,025
Jae Suk, Isn’t this better than...

74
00:02:40,026 --> 00:02:41,725
getting no information at all?

75
00:02:41,726 --> 00:02:42,865
I need to pay for the service.

76
00:02:42,866 --> 00:02:45,136
If you don't pay, you don't get the information now.

77
00:02:45,236 --> 00:02:47,066
So who's joining us today?

78
00:02:47,406 --> 00:02:49,075
- You'll find out later.
- Really?

79
00:02:49,076 --> 00:02:50,536
- I mean, that's obvious.
- My gosh.

80
00:02:50,736 --> 00:02:52,135
- That's...
- What is this?

81
00:02:52,136 --> 00:02:54,006
Is it because we don't pay for a subscription?

82
00:02:54,246 --> 00:02:56,346
- Is it because we didn't pay?
- Right?

83
00:02:56,546 --> 00:02:58,616
Give him some money for the new year and ask.

84
00:02:59,786 --> 00:03:02,016
- My gosh.
- Sir!

85
00:03:02,246 --> 00:03:03,816
We're meeting outside our gym.

86
00:03:04,386 --> 00:03:06,626
Right? We're meeting outside today.

87
00:03:06,786 --> 00:03:07,886
Is that so?

88
00:03:08,386 --> 00:03:09,895
Are you filming something these days?

89
00:03:09,896 --> 00:03:12,966
I'm going to start filming next month.

90
00:03:14,596 --> 00:03:15,795
You know what? I...

91
00:03:15,796 --> 00:03:17,465
- Wait. It's Tae Hyun's voice.
- That's Tae Hyun's voice.

92
00:03:17,466 --> 00:03:20,005
I can recognize his voice right away.

93
00:03:20,006 --> 00:03:21,565
- He said, "I..."
- My gosh.

94
00:03:21,566 --> 00:03:23,335
That little brat is coming again to annoy me.

95
00:03:23,336 --> 00:03:25,135
Tae Hyun is joining us again.

96
00:03:25,136 --> 00:03:26,676
How did you know it was me?

97
00:03:26,706 --> 00:03:28,545
- Gosh. What's this?
- Hello.

98
00:03:28,546 --> 00:03:29,875
- What?
- It was your voice.

99
00:03:29,876 --> 00:03:31,445
- Do Hoon.
- Hello.

100
00:03:31,446 --> 00:03:32,915
- My gosh. What...
- Hello.

101
00:03:32,916 --> 00:03:34,115
- Nice to meet you.
- Hello.

102
00:03:34,116 --> 00:03:35,515
- What's going on?
- Did you two work on a project?

103
00:03:35,516 --> 00:03:37,797
(Whenever he stars on the show, there's a dopamine rush.)

104
00:03:37,916 --> 00:03:40,126
(The episode with the highest TV ratings from Season 1)

105
00:03:40,726 --> 00:03:43,626
(The episode with the highest TV ratings from Season 2)

106
00:03:44,256 --> 00:03:47,196
(The episode with the highest TV ratings from Season 3)

107
00:03:47,826 --> 00:03:48,965
(The rating fairy...)

108
00:03:48,966 --> 00:03:50,735
(of Whenever Possible)

109
00:03:50,736 --> 00:03:52,135
(Tae Hyun joins the show for the fourth time...)

110
00:03:52,136 --> 00:03:53,466
(to celebrate the new year.)

111
00:03:54,136 --> 00:03:58,136
(The class leader with glasses in "Moving")

112
00:03:59,006 --> 00:04:02,246
(He left an impression in "Dear X" too.)

113
00:04:02,676 --> 00:04:03,945
Hello, everyone!

114
00:04:03,946 --> 00:04:06,345
(The hottest actor now, Kim Do Hoon)

115
00:04:06,346 --> 00:04:08,816
What's going on? What's up with this vibe?

116
00:04:09,216 --> 00:04:11,986
- How are you guys here together?
- Tae Hyun, how did you two...

117
00:04:12,056 --> 00:04:13,485
- It looked like...
- We talked on the phone...

118
00:04:13,486 --> 00:04:14,956
a few days ago.

119
00:04:15,126 --> 00:04:17,256
Tae Hyun went, "Hey, Jae Suk."

120
00:04:17,426 --> 00:04:19,626
"I can't tell you where, but we'll meet soon."

121
00:04:20,566 --> 00:04:21,566
(That was today.)

122
00:04:21,567 --> 00:04:24,065
- You're on our show.
- Yes.

123
00:04:24,066 --> 00:04:25,696
- Could you introduce yourself?
- Right.

124
00:04:26,036 --> 00:04:27,606
- Should I look at the camera?
- Yes.

125
00:04:27,966 --> 00:04:30,905
Hello. I'm Actor Kim Do Hoon.

126
00:04:30,906 --> 00:04:34,006
- Nice to meet you.
- Gosh, you're handsome.

127
00:04:34,106 --> 00:04:35,145
- Hello.
- I...

128
00:04:35,146 --> 00:04:36,506
- A hairstyle like that...
- Wait.

129
00:04:36,916 --> 00:04:37,976
You don't have to do that.

130
00:04:39,286 --> 00:04:41,486
Only Do Hoon needs to, not you.

131
00:04:41,546 --> 00:04:43,155
- I do many things for my career.
- Okay.

132
00:04:43,156 --> 00:04:44,856
Many things?

133
00:04:45,416 --> 00:04:47,356
- Did you work on a drama together?
- Yes?

134
00:04:47,956 --> 00:04:49,055
Tae Hyun and I...

135
00:04:49,056 --> 00:04:50,925
- worked together on "Moving."
- Come on. What was that about?

136
00:04:50,926 --> 00:04:52,465
- Jae Suk.
- On "Moving."

137
00:04:52,466 --> 00:04:54,472
- He was more powerful in the drama.
- We met for the first time there.

138
00:04:54,496 --> 00:04:55,695
- I...
- Right.

139
00:04:55,696 --> 00:04:57,936
All I could conjure up was static.

140
00:04:58,396 --> 00:05:01,105
- You played the class leader.
- That's right.

141
00:05:01,106 --> 00:05:02,405
His character was the class leader in the drama.

142
00:05:02,406 --> 00:05:04,376
He was pretty strong too.

143
00:05:04,506 --> 00:05:06,186
- Right. My character was powerful.
- Yes.

144
00:05:06,246 --> 00:05:07,675
- He was fast...
- Do Hoon...

145
00:05:07,676 --> 00:05:09,215
- and powerful.
- Fast and powerful.

146
00:05:09,216 --> 00:05:10,645
- His character was powerful.
- Yes.

147
00:05:10,646 --> 00:05:12,846
So I asked him if he filmed something new.

148
00:05:12,916 --> 00:05:15,116
If he had anything to promote. But he said, "Nothing."

149
00:05:15,786 --> 00:05:18,155
I really don't have anything to promote.

150
00:05:18,156 --> 00:05:19,226
- I see.
- Right.

151
00:05:19,556 --> 00:05:21,285
- Do Hoon, it's about your hair.
- Yes.

152
00:05:21,286 --> 00:05:23,695
You look different with your hair styled like that.

153
00:05:23,696 --> 00:05:25,925
- I wanted to look my best today.
- Right.

154
00:05:25,926 --> 00:05:28,326
- You look different with that.
- It came out really nicely.

155
00:05:28,396 --> 00:05:30,835
My gosh, Do Hoon. Your eyebrows...

156
00:05:30,836 --> 00:05:31,836
(He's amazed by Do Hoon's eyebrows next.)

157
00:05:31,837 --> 00:05:33,836
I trimmed my eyebrows quite a lot.

158
00:05:34,666 --> 00:05:35,735
- I have thick eyebrows...
- Today...

159
00:05:35,736 --> 00:05:37,636
like Angry Bird.

160
00:05:38,536 --> 00:05:40,575
- I have thick eyebrows too.
- Let me see.

161
00:05:40,576 --> 00:05:42,675
- My eyebrows are thick too.
- Yeon Shik too.

162
00:05:42,676 --> 00:05:44,845
Your eyebrows are thick in a beautiful way.

163
00:05:44,846 --> 00:05:46,915
But my eyebrows look thick and messy.

164
00:05:46,916 --> 00:05:48,315
I have to trim my eyebrows too.

165
00:05:48,316 --> 00:05:49,955
- You can just trim them.
- I have to trim them.

166
00:05:49,956 --> 00:05:52,156
If you don't trim them, will you look like an old guru?

167
00:05:53,886 --> 00:05:57,225
- Jae Suk. An old guru? Seriously?
- What?

168
00:05:57,226 --> 00:05:59,172
- An old guru?
- Will you have long eyebrows then?

169
00:05:59,196 --> 00:06:01,396
Will you have long eyebrows? Do you have to cut them?

170
00:06:01,426 --> 00:06:02,895
It must be the age. Old people like us...

171
00:06:02,896 --> 00:06:04,466
- don't have a lot of hair.
- Yes?

172
00:06:05,036 --> 00:06:06,666
- You and me both.
- Let me see.

173
00:06:06,906 --> 00:06:08,205
My eyebrows are quite thin too. Right?

174
00:06:08,206 --> 00:06:09,936
You're missing a lot of hair at the front.

175
00:06:10,806 --> 00:06:11,835
Look at them.

176
00:06:11,836 --> 00:06:13,752
- You two just have thick eyebrows.
- You have thick eyebrows.

177
00:06:13,776 --> 00:06:15,445
- You can play strong characters...
- I see.

178
00:06:15,446 --> 00:06:17,175
- with thick eyebrows.
- Right.

179
00:06:17,176 --> 00:06:18,476
No matter how hard we try,

180
00:06:18,676 --> 00:06:20,036
- We can't do it.
- it won't work.

181
00:06:22,016 --> 00:06:23,415
Do Hoon, how old are you?

182
00:06:23,416 --> 00:06:25,586
- I'm 28 years old.
- What?

183
00:06:25,656 --> 00:06:28,386
- You're older than I expected.
- You think so?

184
00:06:28,656 --> 00:06:29,725
He played a high school student...

185
00:06:29,726 --> 00:06:31,156
- in "Moving."
- Right.

186
00:06:31,356 --> 00:06:34,156
- I thought he was in his early 20s.
- I briefly played a student too.

187
00:06:34,196 --> 00:06:35,325
(He played a high school student in "Moving.")

188
00:06:35,326 --> 00:06:37,496
- You shouldn't bring that up.
- Right.

189
00:06:38,296 --> 00:06:40,235
The staff teased me.

190
00:06:40,236 --> 00:06:41,436
(Finding the staff irritating)

191
00:06:41,666 --> 00:06:43,905
Anyway, the second season of your drama...

192
00:06:43,906 --> 00:06:45,475
- In 2026...
- We're filming it this year.

193
00:06:45,476 --> 00:06:46,476
- So it will premiere...
- Yes.

194
00:06:46,477 --> 00:06:47,705
- It will premiere 2027.
- in 2027.

195
00:06:47,706 --> 00:06:49,875
- Around 2027.
- Be healthy until then.

196
00:06:49,876 --> 00:06:51,475
(Be healthy until then.)

197
00:06:51,476 --> 00:06:53,346
You must be healthy if you want to watch it.

198
00:06:53,646 --> 00:06:54,715
Anyway, it will take a while.

199
00:06:54,716 --> 00:06:55,716
He's already talking...

200
00:06:55,717 --> 00:06:57,877
- about meeting us in 2027.
- He has to do everything.

201
00:06:58,016 --> 00:06:59,325
- Make sure...
- He must do things in advance.

202
00:06:59,326 --> 00:07:01,025
To keep the show going until then.

203
00:07:01,026 --> 00:07:02,156
- Right.
- Okay?

204
00:07:02,286 --> 00:07:04,895
- I must be here to promote it.
- That's right. You have a point.

205
00:07:04,896 --> 00:07:06,042
(He reserves his spot on the show for 2027 too.)

206
00:07:06,066 --> 00:07:07,496
- You're right.
- Right.

207
00:07:07,696 --> 00:07:08,765
Do Hoon, do you have any siblings?

208
00:07:08,766 --> 00:07:11,235
- I have a younger brother.
- I see.

209
00:07:11,236 --> 00:07:12,735
He's still very young.

210
00:07:12,736 --> 00:07:13,736
- How old is he?
- What?

211
00:07:13,737 --> 00:07:15,505
- He's in tenth grade.
- What?

212
00:07:15,506 --> 00:07:17,505
- You're the big brother.
- Yes.

213
00:07:17,506 --> 00:07:19,845
- Your parents had him late.
- He's the only sibling I have.

214
00:07:19,846 --> 00:07:21,605
The age gap is about the same as the one between Yeon Seok and me.

215
00:07:21,606 --> 00:07:22,675
- About 10 years...
- Are you 12 years apart?

216
00:07:22,676 --> 00:07:23,776
- Yes, almost.
- It's...

217
00:07:24,346 --> 00:07:26,086
- Gosh.
- You must keep him on his toes.

218
00:07:26,346 --> 00:07:28,985
I've been scolding him a lot lately.

219
00:07:28,986 --> 00:07:30,315
- Why?
- Why? He's in tenth grade.

220
00:07:30,316 --> 00:07:32,686
- Why are you scolding him?
- He's at that awkward age.

221
00:07:33,286 --> 00:07:36,425
He's not scared of our parents.

222
00:07:36,426 --> 00:07:38,902
- But he's scared of you, right?
- Yes, he's a bit scared of me.

223
00:07:38,926 --> 00:07:40,366
So I'm using that.

224
00:07:40,566 --> 00:07:42,735
But when kids are at that awkward age,

225
00:07:42,736 --> 00:07:44,865
you're not supposed to mention them, are you?

226
00:07:44,866 --> 00:07:47,265
- I thought so too.
- Okay.

227
00:07:47,266 --> 00:07:48,335
But surprisingly, he likes it...

228
00:07:48,336 --> 00:07:50,375
- when I mention him on TV. Yes.
- He likes it?

229
00:07:50,376 --> 00:07:51,835
- It depends on the kid.
- Right.

230
00:07:51,836 --> 00:07:53,645
- I have a son. You know?
- What about him?

231
00:07:53,646 --> 00:07:54,705
- I can finally say his name.
- Su Chan.

232
00:07:54,706 --> 00:07:55,945
- Su Chan.
- Can you mention his name?

233
00:07:55,946 --> 00:07:58,116
- You can now...
- He's done with the CSAT now.

234
00:07:58,876 --> 00:08:00,885
- I can say his name on TV.
- At last.

235
00:08:00,886 --> 00:08:03,355
- No more beating around the bush?
- Gosh, that's over now.

236
00:08:03,356 --> 00:08:04,556
- No more of that.
- Okay.

237
00:08:04,886 --> 00:08:07,925
A while ago, I texted him a long message.

238
00:08:07,926 --> 00:08:09,556
I tend to send long messages.

239
00:08:09,956 --> 00:08:11,796
His replies were always short. "Okay." "Fine."

240
00:08:12,056 --> 00:08:14,396
- What about this time?
- He gave me two lines.

241
00:08:15,896 --> 00:08:17,065
What did he say?

242
00:08:17,066 --> 00:08:18,495
(He responded with two lines.)

243
00:08:18,496 --> 00:08:20,705
I was deeply touched.

244
00:08:20,706 --> 00:08:22,136
- Two lines?
- Two lines.

245
00:08:22,336 --> 00:08:25,706
Of course, he could've turned them into a line.

246
00:08:25,806 --> 00:08:28,806
- But he added a line break.
- But he still sent me two lines.

247
00:08:29,246 --> 00:08:30,915
I took a screenshot of that...

248
00:08:30,916 --> 00:08:32,792
- and sent it to my wife.
- You were that happy?

249
00:08:32,816 --> 00:08:36,016
- A miracle had happened.
- Right.

250
00:08:37,616 --> 00:08:40,325
All right. Let's check where we have to go.

251
00:08:40,326 --> 00:08:41,385
Let's do it.

252
00:08:41,386 --> 00:08:43,425
- "Eom Yu Jeong."
- Yu Jeong.

253
00:08:43,426 --> 00:08:47,496
Yes. "I commute by train with a four-hour round trip."

254
00:08:47,766 --> 00:08:49,395
"As soon as I come to work,"

255
00:08:49,396 --> 00:08:51,866
- "I hear a familiar hissing sound."
- Okay.

256
00:08:52,736 --> 00:08:55,135
- "Just 1g of salt, 1g of sugar,"
- Right.

257
00:08:55,136 --> 00:08:57,035
"or 1°C of temperature..."

258
00:08:57,036 --> 00:08:59,975
"can turn the sky yellow or turn my face pale."

259
00:08:59,976 --> 00:09:01,145
Is it a bakery?

260
00:09:01,146 --> 00:09:02,675
- A bakery?
- Salt goes into it.

261
00:09:02,676 --> 00:09:03,836
- Salt goes into it.
- Right.

262
00:09:04,016 --> 00:09:07,346
"I'm constantly shifting between happiness and sadness."

263
00:09:07,416 --> 00:09:08,485
- So...
- "Would you join me..."

264
00:09:08,486 --> 00:09:10,916
"during my golden and only spare time?"

265
00:09:11,156 --> 00:09:12,856
- Golden spare time?
- Golden spare time?

266
00:09:13,086 --> 00:09:15,726
- She must work in a bakery.
- I agree.

267
00:09:15,986 --> 00:09:17,355
It's on Bongeunsa-ro. We must be pretty close.

268
00:09:17,356 --> 00:09:19,156
- We're close. It's down the street.
- Right.

269
00:09:19,326 --> 00:09:21,725
I live around this neighborhood now.

270
00:09:21,726 --> 00:09:23,096
- Really?
- Yes.

271
00:09:23,596 --> 00:09:25,095
I noticed that the street...

272
00:09:25,096 --> 00:09:26,812
- along the royal tomb was...
- Do you know this bakery?

273
00:09:26,836 --> 00:09:28,565
- where I usually went for walks.
- For walks.

274
00:09:28,566 --> 00:09:31,305
And it's also my running route.

275
00:09:31,306 --> 00:09:33,405
- Really?
- Yes. I was fascinated.

276
00:09:33,406 --> 00:09:35,575
I was just here earlier. Then I came back.

277
00:09:35,576 --> 00:09:36,816
When do we have to be there by?

278
00:09:36,846 --> 00:09:38,876
- By noon.
- Let's get going then.

279
00:09:39,516 --> 00:09:40,616
Where is the place?

280
00:09:40,786 --> 00:09:43,415
- We can go down this way.
- Okay.

281
00:09:43,416 --> 00:09:45,355
Or we can go that way too.

282
00:09:45,356 --> 00:09:47,286
- This way is better.
- Then let's go that way.

283
00:09:47,356 --> 00:09:49,185
- The path here is prettier.
- Okay.

284
00:09:49,186 --> 00:09:50,655
- Okay. Do Hoon...
- This path is prettier.

285
00:09:50,656 --> 00:09:52,126
He said this path was prettier.

286
00:09:52,196 --> 00:09:53,666
(Giggling)

287
00:09:54,026 --> 00:09:56,136
There are so many cafes here.

288
00:09:56,466 --> 00:09:57,635
- Why don't we eat something...
- There are many cafes here.

289
00:09:57,636 --> 00:09:59,035
On our way there?

290
00:09:59,036 --> 00:10:01,965
- Okay. Let's go into a place.
- Like a cafe?

291
00:10:01,966 --> 00:10:04,305
- If you see one, tell us.
- Do you have a regular spot here?

292
00:10:04,306 --> 00:10:06,106
- On the way there?
- On the way there,

293
00:10:06,276 --> 00:10:08,075
- there's a cafe I frequent.
- Really?

294
00:10:08,076 --> 00:10:09,275
Is there a cafe you go to?

295
00:10:09,276 --> 00:10:12,375
Personally, I like going there in spring and autumn.

296
00:10:12,376 --> 00:10:13,885
- Let's go there.
- Okay.

297
00:10:13,886 --> 00:10:14,946
Yes.

298
00:10:15,086 --> 00:10:17,856
- This is a great place for walks.
- By the way,

299
00:10:18,616 --> 00:10:20,185
- this still feels surreal for me.
- Yes?

300
00:10:20,186 --> 00:10:22,726
I rarely get to see Tae Hyun outside.

301
00:10:22,926 --> 00:10:24,456
- Really?
- I always see him...

302
00:10:24,696 --> 00:10:26,366
at the gym. We go to the same one.

303
00:10:26,896 --> 00:10:29,426
- With Tae Hyun?
- Seeing him there is always funny.

304
00:10:29,596 --> 00:10:31,796
- There are machines at the gym.
- Yes.

305
00:10:32,036 --> 00:10:33,636
He doesn't even come near the machines.

306
00:10:33,736 --> 00:10:35,935
- He only does cardio, right?
- He doesn't even do cardio.

307
00:10:35,936 --> 00:10:38,736
- Then what does he do there?
- He goes into the rehab room.

308
00:10:38,976 --> 00:10:40,845
- He just gets the rehab therapy.
- You need the rehab therapy.

309
00:10:40,846 --> 00:10:42,126
- I can't lift weights.
- Right.

310
00:10:42,646 --> 00:10:45,076
- He leaves right after cardio.
- Yes.

311
00:10:45,176 --> 00:10:46,546
- That's typical of you.
- Right.

312
00:10:46,946 --> 00:10:48,585
As we get older, we have to train our muscles...

313
00:10:48,586 --> 00:10:50,215
- out of necessity.
- That's only natural.

314
00:10:50,216 --> 00:10:52,986
- Right. Our body starts to ache.
- Exactly.

315
00:10:53,286 --> 00:10:54,985
Actually, Do Hoon doesn't need...

316
00:10:54,986 --> 00:10:56,696
- to worry about that.
- Not at all.

317
00:10:57,226 --> 00:11:01,025
I heard that a lot from Jun Hyuk.

318
00:11:01,026 --> 00:11:02,566
- Jun Hyuk?
- Lee Jun Hyuk.

319
00:11:03,336 --> 00:11:04,695
- He... Right.
- He's the same age with me.

320
00:11:04,696 --> 00:11:06,566
- He always says his shoulders hurt.
- Right.

321
00:11:06,666 --> 00:11:08,805
- He complains of body aches.
- Right. He's at that age too.

322
00:11:08,806 --> 00:11:10,936
He and I talked on the phone after a long while.

323
00:11:11,336 --> 00:11:13,445
He asked me, "What do you eat when you film?"

324
00:11:13,446 --> 00:11:14,575
(They were both born in 1984.)

325
00:11:14,576 --> 00:11:15,605
"How do you maintain your stamina?"

326
00:11:15,606 --> 00:11:18,015
"What do you eat for that?" He asked me about that.

327
00:11:18,016 --> 00:11:20,016
When Jun Hyuk and I text,

328
00:11:20,246 --> 00:11:23,056
he often writes, "When can I have a comfortable life like you?"

329
00:11:24,716 --> 00:11:27,226
I'd write, "I don't have a comfortable life."

330
00:11:28,026 --> 00:11:29,626
- This is the royal tomb.
- Oh, my.

331
00:11:30,296 --> 00:11:31,525
The ninth king of the Joseon Dynasty.

332
00:11:31,526 --> 00:11:32,855
(The royal tomb of King Seongjong, the 9th king of the Joseon Dynasty)

333
00:11:32,856 --> 00:11:34,326
- That's huge.
- My gosh.

334
00:11:34,666 --> 00:11:36,565
Shouldn't we make a tomb as big as that...

335
00:11:36,566 --> 00:11:38,235
when Jae Suk passes away?

336
00:11:38,236 --> 00:11:39,336
Hey.

337
00:11:39,936 --> 00:11:41,736
- You know what?
- You little...

338
00:11:42,336 --> 00:11:44,617
- We should make him a big tomb too.
- My gosh. That guy.

339
00:11:45,106 --> 00:11:48,275
- Come on. That guy...
- He'll go down in history.

340
00:11:48,276 --> 00:11:51,146
We can change the name of the street to Jaesuk-ro.

341
00:11:51,776 --> 00:11:54,416
- Hey, this is the royal tomb.
- Oh, my.

342
00:11:54,546 --> 00:11:56,655
- Hey, what's that?
- That must be a bakery.

343
00:11:56,656 --> 00:11:58,132
- Do you want to go there?
- A bakery.

344
00:11:58,156 --> 00:11:59,855
- It's a roastery cafe.
- Don't they sell coffee?

345
00:11:59,856 --> 00:12:01,886
- A roastery cafe.
- The sandwiches look great.

346
00:12:02,226 --> 00:12:03,995
- What's this?
- What about the cafe you go to?

347
00:12:03,996 --> 00:12:05,625
- Does it also have baked goods?
- But I was always curious...

348
00:12:05,626 --> 00:12:07,125
about this bakery.

349
00:12:07,126 --> 00:12:09,372
- Let's go there then.
- Shall we go and get some coffee?

350
00:12:09,396 --> 00:12:10,895
- Hey, this place...
- Should we go there?

351
00:12:10,896 --> 00:12:12,565
- is...
- Yes.

352
00:12:12,566 --> 00:12:13,806
- pulling us close.
- Yes.

353
00:12:14,706 --> 00:12:15,806
Look.

354
00:12:16,706 --> 00:12:18,546
Or should we just go to the cafe you frequent?

355
00:12:18,676 --> 00:12:20,505
That cafe is slightly small.

356
00:12:20,506 --> 00:12:22,205
- Then let's go to this one.
- There are seats outside too.

357
00:12:22,206 --> 00:12:23,475
- Then let's go inside.
- Let's ask.

358
00:12:23,476 --> 00:12:24,575
- Okay.
- Wait.

359
00:12:24,576 --> 00:12:26,286
Then why did you even bother to ask?

360
00:12:26,446 --> 00:12:28,392
- Your heart is already set on it.
- This place...

361
00:12:28,416 --> 00:12:30,185
Tae Hyun, isn't this place nice?

362
00:12:30,186 --> 00:12:33,086
Hey. Given how excited he is, it won't end unless we go in. Hurry.

363
00:12:34,586 --> 00:12:36,666
- Let's check inside.
- He's like the bossy manager.

364
00:12:37,156 --> 00:12:39,026
Let's see. It opens at 7am.

365
00:12:39,926 --> 00:12:41,365
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

366
00:12:41,366 --> 00:12:42,725
- Thank you.
- She cut everything for us.

367
00:12:42,726 --> 00:12:43,836
When I went in...

368
00:12:44,036 --> 00:12:46,535
You know what? I love filming this show.

369
00:12:46,536 --> 00:12:47,705
I'm trying out a new cafe...

370
00:12:47,706 --> 00:12:49,166
- around my place.
- Right.

371
00:12:49,906 --> 00:12:51,575
Gosh, this is good.

372
00:12:51,576 --> 00:12:52,576
(Taking a bite)

373
00:12:52,976 --> 00:12:54,776
- Hey.
- I went to an acting school...

374
00:12:55,876 --> 00:12:57,946
around here for a long time.

375
00:12:58,716 --> 00:12:59,845
- Ms. Ji Eun?
- Yes, Ms. Ji Eun.

376
00:12:59,846 --> 00:13:01,245
- I'm learning from her now.
- Really?

377
00:13:01,246 --> 00:13:03,555
- You know the first-floor cafe?
- Yes.

378
00:13:03,556 --> 00:13:05,516
- That's the cafe I mentioned.
- That's the cafe?

379
00:13:05,756 --> 00:13:08,396
- You guys have a lot in common.
- You know a lot about this area.

380
00:13:08,456 --> 00:13:09,725
- So...
- We have something in common.

381
00:13:09,726 --> 00:13:10,902
(They find something in common in Seolleung.)

382
00:13:10,926 --> 00:13:12,496
- This is so good.
- Yes.

383
00:13:12,996 --> 00:13:15,296
I don't know much about coffee. But when I drink lattes,

384
00:13:15,726 --> 00:13:17,736
some lattes taste bitter...

385
00:13:17,896 --> 00:13:20,365
and some have a weird aftertaste.

386
00:13:20,366 --> 00:13:21,706
Lattes are bitter...

387
00:13:23,076 --> 00:13:24,336
when you don't add any syrup.

388
00:13:24,506 --> 00:13:26,906
No. It's different from that.

389
00:13:27,906 --> 00:13:31,016
- Syrup makes everything tasty.
- Gosh, forget it. Shut your mouth.

390
00:13:31,276 --> 00:13:32,346
Come on.

391
00:13:32,816 --> 00:13:35,215
(Unfazed)

392
00:13:35,216 --> 00:13:38,755
Whenever I say harsh things to him, he doesn't get angry.

393
00:13:38,756 --> 00:13:40,455
- It's the syrup.
- He doesn't get angry.

394
00:13:40,456 --> 00:13:41,925
- Syrup makes everything tasty.
- Tae Hyun...

395
00:13:41,926 --> 00:13:43,125
- Hey, adding syrup...
- It gets sweet.

396
00:13:43,126 --> 00:13:44,846
- It's sweet then.
- I like that about him.

397
00:13:45,596 --> 00:13:47,325
- It's almost noon. Let's go.
- Let's hurry.

398
00:13:47,326 --> 00:13:48,606
(It's almost noon as they chat.)

399
00:13:49,026 --> 00:13:50,836
- It's raining.
- It is?

400
00:13:51,236 --> 00:13:52,676
- It's raining again?
- It was good.

401
00:13:53,106 --> 00:13:55,736
Back in the day, this used to be a two-way street.

402
00:13:56,266 --> 00:13:58,506
Then Jae Suk couldn't have walked here back then.

403
00:13:59,506 --> 00:14:00,546
Why not?

404
00:14:01,246 --> 00:14:02,446
He would've been of low birth.

405
00:14:03,176 --> 00:14:05,846
- Hey, I would've been a commoner.
- "Low birth?"

406
00:14:06,986 --> 00:14:10,355
- I would've been a commoner.
- Okay.

407
00:14:10,356 --> 00:14:11,715
- Okay.
- Okay. Got it?

408
00:14:11,716 --> 00:14:12,985
- A commoner.
- I said it was a two-way street,

409
00:14:12,986 --> 00:14:14,255
not a street used by nobles.

410
00:14:14,256 --> 00:14:16,725
- You didn't say "nobles?"
- I said it was a two-way street.

411
00:14:16,726 --> 00:14:18,126
- That's what I heard too.
- I see.

412
00:14:18,326 --> 00:14:20,595
How could you mishear that?

413
00:14:20,596 --> 00:14:22,725
- It became a one-way street now.
- Two-way street.

414
00:14:22,726 --> 00:14:24,712
- Two-way street.
- It used to be a two-way street.

415
00:14:24,736 --> 00:14:25,866
That was hilarious.

416
00:14:27,206 --> 00:14:28,465
I get why the ratings...

417
00:14:28,466 --> 00:14:30,435
- were highest when you joined.
- My gosh, no.

418
00:14:30,436 --> 00:14:33,005
- You keep irritating...
- He irritates Jae Suk.

419
00:14:33,006 --> 00:14:34,045
Right. He irritates Jae Suk.

420
00:14:34,046 --> 00:14:36,846
- He annoys Jae Suk.
- So the viewers love it...

421
00:14:37,746 --> 00:14:39,986
when I get annoyed.

422
00:14:40,886 --> 00:14:43,156
Gosh, I have indigestion today because of him.

423
00:14:43,256 --> 00:14:44,385
(Having indigestion this morning)

424
00:14:44,386 --> 00:14:45,686
He's acting up already.

425
00:14:46,086 --> 00:14:47,802
Do Hoon, how did you end up becoming an actor?

426
00:14:47,826 --> 00:14:48,826
Me?

427
00:14:48,827 --> 00:14:50,925
- Yes.
- Actually, I never thought...

428
00:14:50,926 --> 00:14:52,756
I would become...

429
00:14:53,196 --> 00:14:57,166
- You never thought about acting?
- Right. But I was lucky enough...

430
00:14:57,366 --> 00:14:59,565
- to get cast on the street.
- See?

431
00:14:59,566 --> 00:15:01,065
- to get cast on the street.
- See?

432
00:15:01,066 --> 00:15:03,706
- Really?
- You were picked up on the street.

433
00:15:03,976 --> 00:15:05,575
But the agency...

434
00:15:05,576 --> 00:15:08,375
- wanted me to debut as a singer.
- I see.

435
00:15:08,376 --> 00:15:10,415
- I can see why. Right.
- So...

436
00:15:10,416 --> 00:15:11,845
did you do the camera test?

437
00:15:11,846 --> 00:15:13,385
- Yes. But...
- Did they say no afterward?

438
00:15:13,386 --> 00:15:16,615
I didn't want to be a singer. I wasn't talented enough.

439
00:15:16,616 --> 00:15:18,415
Was it your singing? What held you back?

440
00:15:18,416 --> 00:15:19,985
I was lacking in every area.

441
00:15:19,986 --> 00:15:22,125
So I thought about...

442
00:15:22,126 --> 00:15:25,195
- what I could do in this industry.
- Okay.

443
00:15:25,196 --> 00:15:27,466
I loved watching movies with my dad when I was a kid.

444
00:15:28,566 --> 00:15:30,165
I didn't know anything about acting,

445
00:15:30,166 --> 00:15:31,765
but I applied to an arts high school.

446
00:15:31,766 --> 00:15:32,835
- Did you get in?
- Yes.

447
00:15:32,836 --> 00:15:35,835
I got in then. Back then, it was my grades that got me in.

448
00:15:35,836 --> 00:15:36,875
(He got in thanks to his good grades.)

449
00:15:36,876 --> 00:15:38,305
- Really?
- When I was young,

450
00:15:38,306 --> 00:15:40,205
- I wasn't good at anything else.
- Your grades must've been good.

451
00:15:40,206 --> 00:15:41,982
- I only focused on my studies.
- You got good grades.

452
00:15:42,006 --> 00:15:43,526
- Gosh. You know what?
- That was all.

453
00:15:44,016 --> 00:15:46,375
That's a huge talent too.

454
00:15:46,376 --> 00:15:47,445
- Right.
- Yes.

455
00:15:47,446 --> 00:15:49,785
This is why parents always tell...

456
00:15:49,786 --> 00:15:52,156
their children to study at school.

457
00:15:52,256 --> 00:15:55,486
- Right.
- It's all going to help them later.

458
00:15:56,256 --> 00:15:58,155
Do Hoon has been doing a lot of things...

459
00:15:58,156 --> 00:15:59,925
after starring in "Moving."

460
00:15:59,926 --> 00:16:01,095
Right. Exactly.

461
00:16:01,096 --> 00:16:02,895
- He's on so many projects.
- Everyone's career took off.

462
00:16:02,896 --> 00:16:04,465
Right. He's in so many projects now.

463
00:16:04,466 --> 00:16:05,796
Do Hoon's career took off too.

464
00:16:05,896 --> 00:16:08,005
Jeong Ha worked with you on many projects...

465
00:16:08,006 --> 00:16:09,505
after filming "Moving."

466
00:16:09,506 --> 00:16:10,675
- Right.
- That's right.

467
00:16:10,676 --> 00:16:12,506
- I was quite envious.
- Really?

468
00:16:13,246 --> 00:16:14,475
I didn't know.

469
00:16:14,476 --> 00:16:15,476
(His wish finally comes true.)

470
00:16:15,477 --> 00:16:17,345
It's in the basement of this building.

471
00:16:17,346 --> 00:16:18,346
- Where?
- Which building?

472
00:16:18,347 --> 00:16:20,246
- The one on the right.
- On the right?

473
00:16:21,246 --> 00:16:23,016
- Wait. This place must be it.
- "Makeup?"

474
00:16:23,756 --> 00:16:25,585
- It's a bakery, right?
- It looks like a research lab.

475
00:16:25,586 --> 00:16:28,555
- Is it for baking classes? Hold on.
- We were right.

476
00:16:28,556 --> 00:16:29,556
(Is it a research lab?)

477
00:16:29,557 --> 00:16:30,896
- We were right.
- That's it.

478
00:16:31,826 --> 00:16:34,295
I saw a lab coat from above.

479
00:16:34,296 --> 00:16:35,495
(The first spare time spot is a research lab?)

480
00:16:35,496 --> 00:16:36,736
Is it a research lab?

481
00:16:37,266 --> 00:16:38,665
They set it up here.

482
00:16:38,666 --> 00:16:40,905
- Was it Yu Jeong?
- Eom Yu Jeong.

483
00:16:40,906 --> 00:16:42,436
(Eom Yu Jeong: 12pm to 1pm)

484
00:16:42,836 --> 00:16:44,075
- This is the place.
- We're right. "Lab."

485
00:16:44,076 --> 00:16:45,836
(Gently knocking)

486
00:16:46,906 --> 00:16:47,906
Gosh, hello.

487
00:16:47,907 --> 00:16:49,405
- Hello.
- Hello.

488
00:16:49,406 --> 00:16:50,675
- Is there Yu Jeong here?
- Yu Jeong?

489
00:16:50,676 --> 00:16:51,715
- I see.
- I see.

490
00:16:51,716 --> 00:16:52,915
(Whenever Guest Yu Jeong)

491
00:16:52,916 --> 00:16:53,985
- Hello.
- Hello.

492
00:16:53,986 --> 00:16:55,945
- I was right. You bake here, right?
- Hello.

493
00:16:55,946 --> 00:16:57,055
Yes. With eggs.

494
00:16:57,056 --> 00:16:58,715
(First Whenever Guest Eom Yu Jeong)

495
00:16:58,716 --> 00:17:00,385
- Nice to meet you. My gosh.
- Hello.

496
00:17:00,386 --> 00:17:02,225
You're baking something. My gosh, it smells great.

497
00:17:02,226 --> 00:17:03,325
(The Whenever Guest is experimenting.)

498
00:17:03,326 --> 00:17:05,272
- My gosh. Can you smell that?
- It's a research lab for bread.

499
00:17:05,296 --> 00:17:06,496
It smells so savory.

500
00:17:07,366 --> 00:17:09,125
- Come on in.
- Where can we talk?

501
00:17:09,126 --> 00:17:10,865
It's my lunch break soon. I'll go upstairs.

502
00:17:10,866 --> 00:17:12,065
- To the first floor. Yes.
- Should we wait there then?

503
00:17:12,066 --> 00:17:13,666
- Have a good day.
- Wait, look at that.

504
00:17:13,706 --> 00:17:15,435
- Egg tarts. Yes.
- Egg tarts.

505
00:17:15,436 --> 00:17:16,905
- Hello.
- Gosh.

506
00:17:16,906 --> 00:17:18,452
- Gosh, it smells great.
- Should we go upstairs?

507
00:17:18,476 --> 00:17:19,476
Would you like some?

508
00:17:19,477 --> 00:17:20,976
(Surprised)

509
00:17:21,646 --> 00:17:22,875
- Can we try one?
- Of course. You can try it.

510
00:17:22,876 --> 00:17:24,476
We ought to try freshly baked egg tarts.

511
00:17:25,076 --> 00:17:26,215
- They're fresh out of the oven?
- That's tasty.

512
00:17:26,216 --> 00:17:27,656
- Fresh out of the oven?
- Just one.

513
00:17:28,116 --> 00:17:29,315
- Let's split one.
- Gosh.

514
00:17:29,316 --> 00:17:31,616
- It's hot. Please try it.
- But...

515
00:17:32,286 --> 00:17:33,485
- Did it just come out of the oven?
- Yes.

516
00:17:33,486 --> 00:17:35,725
- Thank you.
- Thank you. We'll enjoy it.

517
00:17:35,726 --> 00:17:37,795
(After obtaining the egg tarts...)

518
00:17:37,796 --> 00:17:39,026
It's the lounge.

519
00:17:39,496 --> 00:17:41,165
- This is the lounge? Let's sit.
- This is the reception room.

520
00:17:41,166 --> 00:17:42,366
- The reception room?
- Yes.

521
00:17:42,426 --> 00:17:44,695
- I'll try an egg tart from the lab.
- We must try it.

522
00:17:44,696 --> 00:17:47,205
- We ought to try it.
- It just came out of the oven.

523
00:17:47,206 --> 00:17:49,235
- Yes.
- It reminds me...

524
00:17:49,236 --> 00:17:50,676
- of a custard bungeoppang.
- Right.

525
00:17:51,376 --> 00:17:53,646
(Taking a bite)

526
00:17:53,946 --> 00:17:55,246
It's nice and toasty.

527
00:17:58,116 --> 00:17:59,845
I've never had a freshly baked egg tart.

528
00:17:59,846 --> 00:18:01,586
- Gosh. Seriously.
- Really? Isn't it good?

529
00:18:03,246 --> 00:18:04,255
It's moist.

530
00:18:04,256 --> 00:18:05,936
- Right? It just came out.
- It's so good.

531
00:18:06,116 --> 00:18:09,556
I've never been to a baking lab.

532
00:18:09,686 --> 00:18:11,255
- It's an egg lab.
- Jae Suk.

533
00:18:11,256 --> 00:18:13,195
- It's an egg lab?
- An egg lab. Yes.

534
00:18:13,196 --> 00:18:14,996
- It's not a baking lab?
- Right.

535
00:18:15,596 --> 00:18:17,965
- Eggs.
- Wait. It's not a baking lab?

536
00:18:17,966 --> 00:18:18,966
- It's an egg lab.
- Eggs.

537
00:18:18,967 --> 00:18:20,247
- An egg lab.
- It's an egg lab.

538
00:18:20,666 --> 00:18:22,305
- There's an egg lab?
- Eggs.

539
00:18:22,306 --> 00:18:24,005
- This is an egg lab?
- Yes.

540
00:18:24,006 --> 00:18:26,906
- We develop products with eggs.
- This is crazy.

541
00:18:28,476 --> 00:18:30,145
(Delicious smells...)

542
00:18:30,146 --> 00:18:32,516
(waft through the lab all day long.)

543
00:18:32,946 --> 00:18:34,286
(Cracking)

544
00:18:34,786 --> 00:18:35,786
(Cracking)

545
00:18:36,286 --> 00:18:38,756
(The lab is filled with cracking sounds.)

546
00:18:39,186 --> 00:18:40,755
(Of the eggs, )

547
00:18:40,756 --> 00:18:42,385
(by the eggs, )

548
00:18:42,386 --> 00:18:44,296
(and for the eggs)

549
00:18:44,896 --> 00:18:48,496
(Whenever Guest Yu Jeong, the egg scientist)

550
00:18:48,996 --> 00:18:50,565
- This is an egg lab?
- Yes.

551
00:18:50,566 --> 00:18:51,635
It's not a baking lab?

552
00:18:51,636 --> 00:18:53,735
We develop products with eggs.

553
00:18:53,736 --> 00:18:54,736
- This is crazy.
- Right.

554
00:18:54,737 --> 00:18:56,875
- Really?
- I love eggs.

555
00:18:56,876 --> 00:18:58,336
I eat 15 eggs a day.

556
00:18:58,736 --> 00:19:00,205
- Fifteen eggs?
- Isn't that too much?

557
00:19:00,206 --> 00:19:01,775
- Why? To bulk up?
- First of all...

558
00:19:01,776 --> 00:19:03,476
No, not for that.

559
00:19:03,916 --> 00:19:05,276
I love eggs.

560
00:19:05,616 --> 00:19:07,586
I eat seven boiled eggs every day.

561
00:19:08,586 --> 00:19:10,215
- I divide up the rest.
- Gosh.

562
00:19:10,216 --> 00:19:11,915
I keep frying those eggs and eat them.

563
00:19:11,916 --> 00:19:13,825
I love fried eggs.

564
00:19:13,826 --> 00:19:15,256
If you eat that many eggs,

565
00:19:16,086 --> 00:19:17,325
won't that be bad for your health?

566
00:19:17,326 --> 00:19:18,726
So far, I'm okay.

567
00:19:18,896 --> 00:19:20,736
For now, his youth can make up for everything.

568
00:19:20,826 --> 00:19:21,826
Don't worry.

569
00:19:22,166 --> 00:19:24,135
- I mean, I love eggs too.
- Seven...

570
00:19:24,136 --> 00:19:25,265
- Fifteen eggs...
- If you eat that many eggs...

571
00:19:25,266 --> 00:19:28,365
- At this lab, you come up with...
- Yes.

572
00:19:28,366 --> 00:19:30,206
- various egg dishes, right?
- Yes.

573
00:19:31,176 --> 00:19:34,405
Then what are some popular egg products...

574
00:19:34,406 --> 00:19:36,176
your lab developed?

575
00:19:36,376 --> 00:19:37,416
Could you show them to us?

576
00:19:37,576 --> 00:19:39,546
You can now buy fried eggs.

577
00:19:39,676 --> 00:19:40,715
- Really?
- These days...

578
00:19:40,716 --> 00:19:42,685
- There are frozen fried eggs.
- Right.

579
00:19:42,686 --> 00:19:43,955
You can buy them now.

580
00:19:43,956 --> 00:19:44,985
- That's right.
- Really?

581
00:19:44,986 --> 00:19:46,785
- Frozen fried eggs.
- They sell frozen fried eggs.

582
00:19:46,786 --> 00:19:48,585
They're perfectly round.

583
00:19:48,586 --> 00:19:49,586
These are our products.

584
00:19:49,587 --> 00:19:50,955
- I see.
- Let's see.

585
00:19:50,956 --> 00:19:51,995
You can just buy rolled omelets?

586
00:19:51,996 --> 00:19:53,095
- I've seen this before!
- Gosh.

587
00:19:53,096 --> 00:19:54,596
My goodness. You startled me.

588
00:19:54,926 --> 00:19:56,835
You can find them at convenience stores these days.

589
00:19:56,836 --> 00:19:58,596
- Just like this one.
- Right.

590
00:19:58,636 --> 00:20:01,166
- This one only has egg whites.
- That's right.

591
00:20:01,536 --> 00:20:02,936
- This...
- Oh, my.

592
00:20:03,136 --> 00:20:04,906
How did they make spicy eggs?

593
00:20:05,236 --> 00:20:07,046
So these are the products you developed.

594
00:20:07,546 --> 00:20:09,406
That's right. I develop products like those.

595
00:20:09,806 --> 00:20:11,945
- Grilled egg whites.
- How does this even taste?

596
00:20:11,946 --> 00:20:13,106
- Egg whites.
- Is this good?

597
00:20:13,346 --> 00:20:14,686
Yes, I like it.

598
00:20:15,616 --> 00:20:16,715
It's my baby.

599
00:20:16,716 --> 00:20:18,115
- Really?
- Did you develop these?

600
00:20:18,116 --> 00:20:19,955
- Yes.
- This is fun.

601
00:20:19,956 --> 00:20:22,255
How did you end up joining this lab?

602
00:20:22,256 --> 00:20:25,995
I really wanted to develop regular food products.

603
00:20:25,996 --> 00:20:30,065
But I thought egg-themed products were quite unique.

604
00:20:30,066 --> 00:20:33,505
There aren't that many egg-themed products in the market.

605
00:20:33,506 --> 00:20:35,636
- That's why you chose this lab?
- So...

606
00:20:36,306 --> 00:20:38,175
How long does it take to develop one product?

607
00:20:38,176 --> 00:20:40,275
Of course, it must vary. But what's the average time?

608
00:20:40,276 --> 00:20:42,606
It takes over three years if it's a long project.

609
00:20:44,016 --> 00:20:45,745
- Over three years?
- Yes.

610
00:20:45,746 --> 00:20:46,985
Sometimes,

611
00:20:46,986 --> 00:20:50,416
we come up with over 100 ratios for 1 product.

612
00:20:50,486 --> 00:20:52,485
Then we have to taste it...

613
00:20:52,486 --> 00:20:54,155
- one hundred times.
- Then when you eat them...

614
00:20:54,156 --> 00:20:55,285
That must be really tough.

615
00:20:55,286 --> 00:20:57,555
- You must keep adjusting recipes.
- That's right.

616
00:20:57,556 --> 00:20:59,055
- Your taste buds...
- You must find the best flavor.

617
00:20:59,056 --> 00:21:00,856
- Their taste buds must be so sharp.
- Right.

618
00:21:01,396 --> 00:21:04,295
Seriously. All the researchers and experts...

619
00:21:04,296 --> 00:21:06,836
working at big companies and labs are so impressive.

620
00:21:06,936 --> 00:21:08,466
I'm serious. They're so amazing.

621
00:21:08,966 --> 00:21:11,375
You've been working with eggs at this lab...

622
00:21:11,376 --> 00:21:12,736
- for over three years.
- Right.

623
00:21:13,206 --> 00:21:16,475
Do you cook eggs at home for your meals?

624
00:21:16,476 --> 00:21:18,345
- I doubt you eat any eggs at home.
- I eat a lot of them.

625
00:21:18,346 --> 00:21:20,386
- Really?
- Yes. When I go home,

626
00:21:20,646 --> 00:21:22,715
- I eat fried eggs.
- Don't you get sick of them?

627
00:21:22,716 --> 00:21:25,956
- No, I don't. Yes.
- This is the perfect job for you.

628
00:21:26,156 --> 00:21:27,985
How do you eat your eggs?

629
00:21:27,986 --> 00:21:29,555
Sunny-side ups? Or...

630
00:21:29,556 --> 00:21:30,755
- I like over-easy eggs.
- Over-easy eggs?

631
00:21:30,756 --> 00:21:33,025
Yes. I want my yolk super runny.

632
00:21:33,026 --> 00:21:34,225
- A runny yolk.
- Yes.

633
00:21:34,226 --> 00:21:35,665
- Super runny.
- Super runny.

634
00:21:35,666 --> 00:21:39,295
I don't like a traditional sunny-side up.

635
00:21:39,296 --> 00:21:40,565
I like my yolk...

636
00:21:40,566 --> 00:21:41,965
- somewhat runny.
- I like runny yolks too.

637
00:21:41,966 --> 00:21:43,105
Do you want it to be slightly cooked?

638
00:21:43,106 --> 00:21:44,475
Just slightly cooked.

639
00:21:44,476 --> 00:21:45,975
Slightly cooked? Just when it starts to set?

640
00:21:45,976 --> 00:21:47,505
Just when it's about to firm up.

641
00:21:47,506 --> 00:21:49,675
- That's why when I cook my eggs, - Yes.

642
00:21:49,676 --> 00:21:51,245
I start with four.

643
00:21:51,246 --> 00:21:52,975
- What?
- All at the same time. So...

644
00:21:52,976 --> 00:21:55,062
- two of them are fully cooked.
- They're all different?

645
00:21:55,086 --> 00:21:57,685
One of them is slightly cooked like how you mentioned it.

646
00:21:57,686 --> 00:21:59,755
- Do Hoon really loves eggs.
- The last one...

647
00:21:59,756 --> 00:22:01,855
- has a super runny yolk.
- He eats 15 eggs a day.

648
00:22:01,856 --> 00:22:03,136
- He eats more than me.
- You...

649
00:22:03,626 --> 00:22:05,155
What's your favorite dipping sauce for fried eggs?

650
00:22:05,156 --> 00:22:06,925
I just eat them plain.

651
00:22:06,926 --> 00:22:08,525
- Just plain?
- I just eat them by themselves.

652
00:22:08,526 --> 00:22:10,026
- Do you dip it in ketchup?
- I do.

653
00:22:10,396 --> 00:22:11,696
Kids dip it in ketchup.

654
00:22:11,836 --> 00:22:13,295
- He's still young.
- I'm still a kid.

655
00:22:13,296 --> 00:22:15,496
- Kids always dip it in ketchup.
- I dip it in ketchup.

656
00:22:17,406 --> 00:22:19,535
What do you and your colleagues usually eat for lunch?

657
00:22:19,536 --> 00:22:22,545
We usually bring our own lunch...

658
00:22:22,546 --> 00:22:23,546
- and eat that.
- You can do that?

659
00:22:23,547 --> 00:22:26,345
You guys bring your own lunch and share it with the group.

660
00:22:26,346 --> 00:22:28,515
- Yes, we share it too.
- That's fun too.

661
00:22:28,516 --> 00:22:30,485
Sometimes, I make rolled omelets for them.

662
00:22:30,486 --> 00:22:31,685
- More eggs?
- Or...

663
00:22:31,686 --> 00:22:32,716
(More eggs?)

664
00:22:33,086 --> 00:22:34,155
What about that?

665
00:22:34,156 --> 00:22:35,685
- We sometimes fry up some eggs.
- Gosh.

666
00:22:35,686 --> 00:22:38,355
- But usually... Right.
- They work at an egg lab.

667
00:22:38,356 --> 00:22:39,425
You could be sick of eggs.

668
00:22:39,426 --> 00:22:40,465
Shouldn't eggs be banned from lunch?

669
00:22:40,466 --> 00:22:41,466
- From their meals?
- No.

670
00:22:41,467 --> 00:22:42,866
I would feel that way too.

671
00:22:43,066 --> 00:22:45,135
They're always working with eggs.

672
00:22:45,136 --> 00:22:46,635
They have to taste so many eggs.

673
00:22:46,636 --> 00:22:48,165
(Yu Jeong always brings egg-packed lunches.)

674
00:22:48,166 --> 00:22:49,166
She loves eggs.

675
00:22:49,167 --> 00:22:50,376
- This...
- What?

676
00:22:50,636 --> 00:22:51,935
- Wait. Is it possible...
- Gosh.

677
00:22:51,936 --> 00:22:53,436
- that you're gaslighted?
- Gosh.

678
00:22:55,076 --> 00:22:56,775
- She's serious about eggs.
- I pack...

679
00:22:56,776 --> 00:22:59,675
By the way, what made you write to our show?

680
00:22:59,676 --> 00:23:02,485
Our lab used to be in Jincheon,

681
00:23:02,486 --> 00:23:04,585
- Yes.
- South Chungcheong Province.

682
00:23:04,586 --> 00:23:06,655
Our lab moved to Seoul.

683
00:23:06,656 --> 00:23:08,155
To commute, a one-way trip takes...

684
00:23:08,156 --> 00:23:09,685
- two hours.
- So it's a four-hour round trip.

685
00:23:09,686 --> 00:23:11,455
- That explains your letter.
- Right.

686
00:23:11,456 --> 00:23:12,456
(I commute by train with a four-hour round trip.)

687
00:23:12,457 --> 00:23:13,865
- Where do you live?
- Pyeongtaek.

688
00:23:13,866 --> 00:23:15,165
- Pyeongtaek?
- Usually,

689
00:23:15,166 --> 00:23:17,765
people like it when they move to Seoul.

690
00:23:17,766 --> 00:23:19,265
- But it's too far from home.
- It's the opposite for her.

691
00:23:19,266 --> 00:23:21,105
- It's gotten farther. Right.
- It's the other way around.

692
00:23:21,106 --> 00:23:24,005
Then what do you usually do while commuting?

693
00:23:24,006 --> 00:23:25,505
She must make good use of her commuting time.

694
00:23:25,506 --> 00:23:26,975
- Of course, she can...
- She can get some sleep.

695
00:23:26,976 --> 00:23:28,175
Catch up on some sleep.

696
00:23:28,176 --> 00:23:29,445
But is there something specific you do?

697
00:23:29,446 --> 00:23:31,675
- I can't sleep because I stand.
- Really?

698
00:23:31,676 --> 00:23:32,775
- You have to stand?
- Yes.

699
00:23:32,776 --> 00:23:35,715
- So many people commute to Seoul.
- Yes, that's right.

700
00:23:35,716 --> 00:23:37,985
- I carry a foldable chair with me.
- Right.

701
00:23:37,986 --> 00:23:39,916
It's a small camping chair.

702
00:23:40,116 --> 00:23:41,125
I bet a lot of people do that.

703
00:23:41,126 --> 00:23:42,555
Right. Everyone does the same thing.

704
00:23:42,556 --> 00:23:43,696
- Really?
- Yes.

705
00:23:43,826 --> 00:23:46,125
You can see that on SRT train. Do you know telescopic stools?

706
00:23:46,126 --> 00:23:47,365
- But...
- Oh, the telescopic stools?

707
00:23:47,366 --> 00:23:49,665
- The plastic chairs?
- You can pull it vertically.

708
00:23:49,666 --> 00:23:50,795
- The circular one.
- That one.

709
00:23:50,796 --> 00:23:52,635
- The stools.
- People bring either that...

710
00:23:52,636 --> 00:23:54,335
- or camping chairs.
- The folding chairs.

711
00:23:54,336 --> 00:23:55,605
- They sit on folding chairs.
- Right.

712
00:23:55,606 --> 00:23:56,765
That must be a fun sight.

713
00:23:56,766 --> 00:23:58,075
(The commuters from Pyeongtaek to Seoul)

714
00:23:58,076 --> 00:24:00,846
What are some good things since the lab moved to Seoul?

715
00:24:01,306 --> 00:24:03,506
There's one. Starbucks is nearby.

716
00:24:04,246 --> 00:24:05,875
- Right.
- I love it.

717
00:24:05,876 --> 00:24:07,615
- That's...
- There's one...

718
00:24:07,616 --> 00:24:08,685
- right outside the main road.
- It's right there.

719
00:24:08,686 --> 00:24:10,355
There were so many cute cafes too.

720
00:24:10,356 --> 00:24:12,215
Jincheon... Is it okay to say this?

721
00:24:12,216 --> 00:24:13,585
- To go to a cafe, - Sure.

722
00:24:13,586 --> 00:24:15,055
We must drive for ten minutes.

723
00:24:15,056 --> 00:24:16,155
- But here, - When it comes to cafes...

724
00:24:16,156 --> 00:24:17,456
I can just walk there.

725
00:24:17,796 --> 00:24:19,716
- Starbucks has a certain charm.
- I'm so happy.

726
00:24:20,526 --> 00:24:22,865
Great. Now that we're here...

727
00:24:22,866 --> 00:24:25,336
during Yu Jeong's break... All right.

728
00:24:25,466 --> 00:24:27,066
- Do Hoon, why don't you try?
- Me?

729
00:24:27,106 --> 00:24:28,106
One, two, three.

730
00:24:33,506 --> 00:24:34,506
Please.

731
00:24:34,746 --> 00:24:36,105
- Okay.
- One.

732
00:24:36,106 --> 00:24:37,945
- That's good.
- Yes, that's enough.

733
00:24:37,946 --> 00:24:39,575
- As long as it's not 0, it's okay.
- I'm relieved that it wasn't 0.

734
00:24:39,576 --> 00:24:40,886
This is just enough. Here.

735
00:24:41,286 --> 00:24:42,386
- Round One.
- Let me.

736
00:24:43,086 --> 00:24:44,286
Yeon Shik.

737
00:24:44,856 --> 00:24:47,025
- The present for Round One.
- Is your zodiac animal a horse?

738
00:24:47,026 --> 00:24:48,125
No, I was born in the Year of the Rooster.

739
00:24:48,126 --> 00:24:49,585
- The Year of the Rooster.
- The Year of the Rooster?

740
00:24:49,586 --> 00:24:51,526
- For real?
- That's fate for you.

741
00:24:51,726 --> 00:24:53,425
- The Year of the Rooster?
- Yes, that's right.

742
00:24:53,426 --> 00:24:55,195
Of all years, the Year of the Rooster.

743
00:24:55,196 --> 00:24:56,225
An egg expert...

744
00:24:56,226 --> 00:24:58,186
- born in the Year of the Rooster.
- Interesting.

745
00:24:58,396 --> 00:25:00,865
"I want to read peacefully during the four-hour commute..."

746
00:25:00,866 --> 00:25:03,305
"to and from work. Sony headphones."

747
00:25:03,306 --> 00:25:05,005
(Round 1 prize: Sony headphones)

748
00:25:05,006 --> 00:25:06,336
- Headphones.
- Headphones.

749
00:25:06,606 --> 00:25:08,746
- Sony headphones.
- Nice.

750
00:25:09,046 --> 00:25:10,545
Aren't those noise-cancelling headphones?

751
00:25:10,546 --> 00:25:11,676
It's a good one.

752
00:25:12,076 --> 00:25:14,785
- Let's give her some joy...
- Right.

753
00:25:14,786 --> 00:25:16,185
With a prize that'll heal...

754
00:25:16,186 --> 00:25:17,715
both her tired heart and body...

755
00:25:17,716 --> 00:25:19,286
- during her commute.
- Yes.

756
00:25:19,616 --> 00:25:21,526
The mission is what matters.

757
00:25:22,026 --> 00:25:23,525
- It's lunch time, right?
- Yes.

758
00:25:23,526 --> 00:25:24,656
The center.

759
00:25:25,156 --> 00:25:26,825
- It's us.
- What is it?

760
00:25:26,826 --> 00:25:28,566
- The four of us.
- Where?

761
00:25:28,696 --> 00:25:30,366
(Greeting)

762
00:25:30,736 --> 00:25:32,365
It's really amazing how you're an egg expert...

763
00:25:32,366 --> 00:25:34,005
- born in the Year of the Rooster.
- Yes.

764
00:25:34,006 --> 00:25:35,982
- What about it?
- Isn't your nickname Yu the Egg?

765
00:25:36,006 --> 00:25:38,035
- There was a time.
- Right?

766
00:25:38,036 --> 00:25:39,736
My gut tells me it was Yu the Egg.

767
00:25:39,906 --> 00:25:41,275
- Correct.
- You were born for eggs.

768
00:25:41,276 --> 00:25:42,345
Most likely.

769
00:25:42,346 --> 00:25:44,015
You live close by. How about coming to work here?

770
00:25:44,016 --> 00:25:45,345
- That's a good idea.
- Gosh.

771
00:25:45,346 --> 00:25:47,615
- My house is nearby.
- How about we...

772
00:25:47,616 --> 00:25:49,215
(The mission together with the egg maniacs)

773
00:25:49,216 --> 00:25:51,786
(The Eggs are Here!)

774
00:25:51,916 --> 00:25:54,726
(Flick the egg carton to move...)

775
00:25:54,926 --> 00:25:58,156
(the ping-pong balls forward one row at a time.)

776
00:25:58,356 --> 00:26:01,466
(If the ping-pong ball leaves the row or falls off, it's a fail.)

777
00:26:02,396 --> 00:26:04,666
- One row at a time?
- Flick the egg carton?

778
00:26:05,466 --> 00:26:06,866
How can each player...

779
00:26:07,336 --> 00:26:08,736
- Like this?
- Is it possible?

780
00:26:09,506 --> 00:26:11,035
- Round One is...
- This?

781
00:26:11,036 --> 00:26:12,106
How is this...

782
00:26:12,676 --> 00:26:14,152
- Isn't it...
- The whole row has to move?

783
00:26:14,176 --> 00:26:15,575
So we have to move the ping-pong balls...

784
00:26:15,576 --> 00:26:16,946
- Yes.
- one row at a time...

785
00:26:17,046 --> 00:26:18,475
- until the other end?
- It's possible?

786
00:26:18,476 --> 00:26:19,715
Isn't this absurd?

787
00:26:19,716 --> 00:26:20,885
(It's possible?)

788
00:26:20,886 --> 00:26:22,145
- We can't do it.
- How is this Round One?

789
00:26:22,146 --> 00:26:23,545
- The egg carton...
- This is...

790
00:26:23,546 --> 00:26:24,616
I think they'll fail.

791
00:26:24,786 --> 00:26:26,155
- We can't do it.
- For real.

792
00:26:26,156 --> 00:26:27,325
- Try it.
- Hold on.

793
00:26:27,326 --> 00:26:28,326
It's hard.

794
00:26:29,156 --> 00:26:30,655
- Wait.
- You can actually do it.

795
00:26:30,656 --> 00:26:32,296
So like this?

796
00:26:33,596 --> 00:26:35,696
- But it's tough.
- Like this? You keep failing.

797
00:26:36,096 --> 00:26:37,735
The ping-pong balls are too light.

798
00:26:37,736 --> 00:26:39,495
- No methods work.
- Try it.

799
00:26:39,496 --> 00:26:40,865
- It's too difficult.
- All four succeeding...

800
00:26:40,866 --> 00:26:42,236
is the toughest.

801
00:26:42,306 --> 00:26:43,566
You really...

802
00:26:43,876 --> 00:26:45,235
Here's the hard part.

803
00:26:45,236 --> 00:26:46,935
- All of us succeeding.
- This is bad.

804
00:26:46,936 --> 00:26:48,275
See that?

805
00:26:48,276 --> 00:26:50,076
One practice isn't enough. Give us more time.

806
00:26:50,446 --> 00:26:51,876
This is bad.

807
00:26:52,476 --> 00:26:54,016
- It's...
- Isn't it...

808
00:26:54,386 --> 00:26:56,046
- This mission is too hard.
- It's...

809
00:26:56,746 --> 00:26:59,086
- Gosh.
- That's it. Nice.

810
00:27:00,086 --> 00:27:01,086
Go.

811
00:27:01,556 --> 00:27:03,486
(Succeeded on his first try?)

812
00:27:03,996 --> 00:27:05,796
(Impressed)

813
00:27:06,226 --> 00:27:07,825
- It's not impossible.
- How did you do it?

814
00:27:07,826 --> 00:27:08,966
I just did it.

815
00:27:10,366 --> 00:27:11,596
How do we each...

816
00:27:13,166 --> 00:27:14,266
- Gosh.
- Success.

817
00:27:15,336 --> 00:27:16,466
- Gosh.
- Success.

818
00:27:16,536 --> 00:27:18,175
- Hold on.
- Try it.

819
00:27:18,176 --> 00:27:19,935
- Try it.
- I've got the hang of it.

820
00:27:19,936 --> 00:27:22,276
Lightly.

821
00:27:23,146 --> 00:27:24,176
That's it.

822
00:27:24,516 --> 00:27:25,945
- It's not impossible.
- They're good at it.

823
00:27:25,946 --> 00:27:26,975
My hopes are going up.

824
00:27:26,976 --> 00:27:28,762
- You brought them this far.
- It's possible.

825
00:27:28,786 --> 00:27:31,515
(Practice: Jae Suk)

826
00:27:31,516 --> 00:27:32,616
Nice.

827
00:27:33,286 --> 00:27:34,625
- Okay.
- Things look bright.

828
00:27:34,626 --> 00:27:35,986
Right? Nice.

829
00:27:36,826 --> 00:27:39,226
- That's it. Next is Do Hoon.
- My turn.

830
00:27:39,356 --> 00:27:41,495
- The last is Do Hoon.
- Being last is tough.

831
00:27:41,496 --> 00:27:43,326
- The last is Do Hoon.
- Being last is tough.

832
00:27:46,036 --> 00:27:47,036
(Even the last, Do Hoon, succeeded!)

833
00:27:47,037 --> 00:27:48,065
At this rate, we'll succeed.

834
00:27:48,066 --> 00:27:49,542
- The bottom is where to hold.
- Okay.

835
00:27:49,566 --> 00:27:50,775
- Let's try it.
- I've got it.

836
00:27:50,776 --> 00:27:52,475
- Shall we try?
- We can succeed if we do like this.

837
00:27:52,476 --> 00:27:53,476
- Shall we?
- Yes.

838
00:27:53,477 --> 00:27:54,605
- Let's give it a shot.
- Round One.

839
00:27:54,606 --> 00:27:56,175
- Round One. Here we go.
- Let's try.

840
00:27:56,176 --> 00:27:57,275
- In one, two, three.
- Two, three.

841
00:27:57,276 --> 00:27:58,375
- Let's go!
- Let's go!

842
00:27:58,376 --> 00:28:00,045
- Here we go.
- I go first.

843
00:28:00,046 --> 00:28:02,986
(Out of 10 total tries, they're on try number 1.)

844
00:28:03,646 --> 00:28:04,755
Okay, here I go.

845
00:28:04,756 --> 00:28:07,015
(1st try, Tae Hyun)

846
00:28:07,016 --> 00:28:08,386
- Here.
- Stay calm.

847
00:28:08,856 --> 00:28:10,526
I'm strong in real games.

848
00:28:11,556 --> 00:28:13,295
- You threw the socks well.
- Right?

849
00:28:13,296 --> 00:28:14,895
- I'm weak in real games.
- Exactly.

850
00:28:14,896 --> 00:28:16,095
- Really.
- True.

851
00:28:16,096 --> 00:28:17,195
(Nickname: Practice World Messi)

852
00:28:17,196 --> 00:28:18,266
No, please.

853
00:28:20,806 --> 00:28:22,035
(Succeeded in the real game!)

854
00:28:22,036 --> 00:28:24,675
- Here. Let's go.
- We're all set.

855
00:28:24,676 --> 00:28:27,006
- Let's go. Good luck.
- What's gotten into you?

856
00:28:27,106 --> 00:28:28,645
- Good luck.
- Good luck.

857
00:28:28,646 --> 00:28:30,915
- Just do as you did earlier.
- This is a tough one.

858
00:28:30,916 --> 00:28:36,785
(1st try, Yeon Seok)

859
00:28:36,786 --> 00:28:37,786
All right.

860
00:28:39,086 --> 00:28:40,955
(The only one left is Do Hoon.)

861
00:28:40,956 --> 00:28:42,755
- All right. Good luck.
- All right.

862
00:28:42,756 --> 00:28:44,195
- My heart is pumping fast.
- Listen.

863
00:28:44,196 --> 00:28:46,455
- You've succeeded until now.
- Good luck.

864
00:28:46,456 --> 00:28:48,225
- Just do as you did earlier.
- Keep it up.

865
00:28:48,226 --> 00:28:49,326
Just like earlier.

866
00:28:49,466 --> 00:28:50,565
Good luck.

867
00:28:50,566 --> 00:28:52,395
(1st try, Do Hoon)

868
00:28:52,396 --> 00:28:53,496
This is nerve-racking.

869
00:28:53,836 --> 00:28:55,565
- Give me a minute.
- Going last is...

870
00:28:55,566 --> 00:28:56,765
- Hey.
- Little did I think...

871
00:28:56,766 --> 00:28:57,936
I'd be this nervous.

872
00:29:05,576 --> 00:29:08,616
(They'll pass Round 1 right away if Do Hoon succeeds.)

873
00:29:12,456 --> 00:29:15,026
(He failed.)

874
00:29:16,086 --> 00:29:17,156
(Screaming)

875
00:29:20,896 --> 00:29:22,025
Oh, no.

876
00:29:22,026 --> 00:29:24,096
- I'm sorry.
- It's okay.

877
00:29:26,536 --> 00:29:28,265
(Both are suffering from headaches.)

878
00:29:28,266 --> 00:29:29,836
- It's okay.
- It's okay.

879
00:29:30,366 --> 00:29:32,105
- This...
- Being last makes you nervous.

880
00:29:32,106 --> 00:29:33,875
- It's because I'm nervous.
- True, especially going last.

881
00:29:33,876 --> 00:29:36,406
Do Hoon. Aren't you a hero?

882
00:29:37,106 --> 00:29:38,275
You're a hero.

883
00:29:38,276 --> 00:29:40,986
Earlier, one of the researchers was like...

884
00:29:42,716 --> 00:29:44,685
(Screaming in high-pitch out of disappointment)

885
00:29:44,686 --> 00:29:46,086
I felt how annoyed she was.

886
00:29:46,816 --> 00:29:49,026
- Nice.
- Like that.

887
00:29:49,286 --> 00:29:50,526
- Nice.
- What?

888
00:29:51,926 --> 00:29:52,996
That was some wizardry.

889
00:29:53,056 --> 00:29:54,995
- If only I could keep this up.
- Exactly.

890
00:29:54,996 --> 00:29:56,465
- Do Hoon.
- Yes?

891
00:29:56,466 --> 00:29:57,695
- Do better in the real game.
- Succeed in the real game.

892
00:29:57,696 --> 00:30:00,336
- Got it. I'll do better.
- Focus only on yourself, okay?

893
00:30:00,766 --> 00:30:03,065
- Let's try again in this order.
- Once more?

894
00:30:03,066 --> 00:30:04,135
Once more. In 1...

895
00:30:04,136 --> 00:30:06,205
- In 1, 2, 3. Here we go!
- In 1, 2, 3. Here we go!

896
00:30:06,206 --> 00:30:07,605
- Let's go.
- Which one is it?

897
00:30:07,606 --> 00:30:08,645
Is it "here we go" or "let's go?"

898
00:30:08,646 --> 00:30:10,476
- Here we go.
- Do it again.

899
00:30:10,776 --> 00:30:11,945
- You little...
- Here.

900
00:30:11,946 --> 00:30:13,746
- In 1, 2, 3. Here we go!
- Here we go!

901
00:30:13,846 --> 00:30:14,846
(Out of 10 total tries, they're on try number 2.)

902
00:30:14,847 --> 00:30:16,416
- Were we in sync?
- Yes.

903
00:30:17,146 --> 00:30:18,955
We must pass Round Two.

904
00:30:18,956 --> 00:30:20,855
Yes, we must pass Round Two.

905
00:30:20,856 --> 00:30:21,856
Exactly.

906
00:30:31,396 --> 00:30:33,536
(Frozen as is)

907
00:30:36,336 --> 00:30:37,436
You were doing well.

908
00:30:38,376 --> 00:30:40,606
- Honestly, this was...
- How did this happen?

909
00:30:41,046 --> 00:30:42,476
This try wasn't even upsetting.

910
00:30:43,846 --> 00:30:44,915
He's right.

911
00:30:44,916 --> 00:30:46,422
(The heroes failed one after the other.)

912
00:30:46,446 --> 00:30:48,015
But this mission is truly tough.

913
00:30:48,016 --> 00:30:50,245
- Exactly.
- One wrong move and...

914
00:30:50,246 --> 00:30:51,556
We're not trying yet, are we?

915
00:30:55,356 --> 00:30:56,856
- Okay.
- You're not bad today.

916
00:30:57,026 --> 00:30:59,025
- Not bad today, am I?
- No.

917
00:30:59,026 --> 00:31:00,555
Okay. In 1, 2, 3.

918
00:31:00,556 --> 00:31:02,165
- Here we go!
- Here we go! What try are we on?

919
00:31:02,166 --> 00:31:03,926
- The 3rd.
- The 4th.

920
00:31:04,026 --> 00:31:05,095
- The fourth.
- We have to...

921
00:31:05,096 --> 00:31:07,035
- We have to succeed at this point.
- Yes. We have to.

922
00:31:07,036 --> 00:31:08,166
- Or else...
- Okay.

923
00:31:08,806 --> 00:31:10,006
- Focus.
- Please no.

924
00:31:10,606 --> 00:31:11,606
Here I go.

925
00:31:11,607 --> 00:31:13,235
(4th try, Tae Hyun)

926
00:31:13,236 --> 00:31:14,275
Good.

927
00:31:14,276 --> 00:31:15,475
(4th try, Jae Suk)

928
00:31:15,476 --> 00:31:16,646
Don't think too much.

929
00:31:18,216 --> 00:31:19,576
(He failed.)

930
00:31:20,716 --> 00:31:21,716
(Reading the room)

931
00:31:21,717 --> 00:31:23,185
- You should've thought a bit more.
- Just like me,

932
00:31:23,186 --> 00:31:24,555
the balls landed in zig-zag.

933
00:31:24,556 --> 00:31:26,256
Other than which side the balls landed,

934
00:31:26,586 --> 00:31:28,686
they look just like when I failed my try.

935
00:31:28,956 --> 00:31:31,025
When we try nonstop,

936
00:31:31,026 --> 00:31:33,326
- we find a rhythm.
- There's a rhythm.

937
00:31:33,526 --> 00:31:35,266
- You're right.
- What do we do?

938
00:31:36,126 --> 00:31:37,686
- Change the order?
- Change the order?

939
00:31:37,936 --> 00:31:38,936
- Okay.
- How about it?

940
00:31:38,937 --> 00:31:39,942
Let's start from that end.

941
00:31:39,966 --> 00:31:41,335
You start, Do Hoon.

942
00:31:41,336 --> 00:31:42,365
- Me?
- Yes, first player.

943
00:31:42,366 --> 00:31:43,606
- Let me practice.
- Go ahead.

944
00:31:45,776 --> 00:31:46,836
That's it.

945
00:31:46,936 --> 00:31:48,476
- And...
- All I have to do is this.

946
00:31:48,606 --> 00:31:50,445
- You are done.
- We have to succeed this time.

947
00:31:50,446 --> 00:31:52,276
- Or else...
- Seriously.

948
00:31:52,746 --> 00:31:54,016
- I'm really nervous.
- Oh, no.

949
00:31:54,686 --> 00:31:56,145
- Grab the end of it.
- Where?

950
00:31:56,146 --> 00:31:57,556
Further to the end.

951
00:31:57,986 --> 00:31:59,216
Do it until you succeed.

952
00:31:59,386 --> 00:32:00,415
Got it.

953
00:32:00,416 --> 00:32:01,856
(Do Hoon calms himself down.)

954
00:32:03,586 --> 00:32:04,855
(I want to succeed.)

955
00:32:04,856 --> 00:32:06,195
(I want to succeed at least once.)

956
00:32:06,196 --> 00:32:08,926
(I'm a hero.)

957
00:32:09,426 --> 00:32:11,065
- They're so cool.
- It must be nerve-racking.

958
00:32:11,066 --> 00:32:12,695
- Honestly...
- Grab here, right?

959
00:32:12,696 --> 00:32:14,366
(Trying to ease the tension)

960
00:32:14,506 --> 00:32:15,905
- He's already done it.
- Got it.

961
00:32:15,906 --> 00:32:17,535
- Let's do a cheer.
- Okay.

962
00:32:17,536 --> 00:32:19,435
- It's "let's go" this time.
- In one... "Let's go."

963
00:32:19,436 --> 00:32:21,445
- In 1, 2, 3. Let's go!
- Let's go!

964
00:32:21,446 --> 00:32:22,545
Let's use the coupon if we fail again.

965
00:32:22,546 --> 00:32:23,675
- We have to succeed.
- It's the fifth try.

966
00:32:23,676 --> 00:32:24,715
That's half our tries.

967
00:32:24,716 --> 00:32:25,745
This is bad.

968
00:32:25,746 --> 00:32:26,975
- Okay.
- We need to get to Round Two.

969
00:32:26,976 --> 00:32:28,485
(5th try, Do Hoon)

970
00:32:28,486 --> 00:32:30,146
- Lightly.
- Right.

971
00:32:30,316 --> 00:32:31,316
Toss it lightly.

972
00:32:32,356 --> 00:32:34,016
(His both hands are shaking.)

973
00:32:40,626 --> 00:32:42,196
(He failed.)

974
00:32:46,136 --> 00:32:48,305
- That's a bit...
- Hold on.

975
00:32:48,306 --> 00:32:49,606
- It's...
- Wait.

976
00:32:50,236 --> 00:32:51,705
- It's...
- Wait.

977
00:32:51,706 --> 00:32:53,775
(The air has turned ice cold.)

978
00:32:53,776 --> 00:32:55,906
- What now?
- We've suddenly hit a slump.

979
00:32:56,076 --> 00:32:57,776
- I have a bad feeling.
- But...

980
00:32:58,516 --> 00:33:00,246
Can't you cut us some slack on this one?

981
00:33:00,576 --> 00:33:02,316
- What...
- It's because...

982
00:33:03,786 --> 00:33:04,885
- At first...
- The reason has to be valid.

983
00:33:04,886 --> 00:33:06,755
- Do Hoon.
- It was our first...

984
00:33:06,756 --> 00:33:08,025
Our team has no mercy.

985
00:33:08,026 --> 00:33:10,085
- Give them a more valid reason.
- Let's practice again.

986
00:33:10,086 --> 00:33:11,595
- It's our sixth try.
- Yeon Seok...

987
00:33:11,596 --> 00:33:13,725
- We have to succeed now.
- It's better not to practice.

988
00:33:13,726 --> 00:33:15,466
- Shall we try right away?
- I'm in.

989
00:33:16,026 --> 00:33:17,225
- Here we go.
- Okay.

990
00:33:17,226 --> 00:33:18,265
(Out of 10 total tries, they're on try number 6.)

991
00:33:18,266 --> 00:33:19,535
In 1, 2, 3.

992
00:33:19,536 --> 00:33:20,635
- Here we go!
- Here we go!

993
00:33:20,636 --> 00:33:22,765
(6th try, Tae Hyun)

994
00:33:22,766 --> 00:33:24,575
- That had a rhythm.
- Just do it.

995
00:33:24,576 --> 00:33:25,736
- All right.
- No pressure.

996
00:33:26,006 --> 00:33:27,035
Find the rhythm.

997
00:33:27,036 --> 00:33:28,916
- The rhythm.
- Don't think. Don't look at him.

998
00:33:29,646 --> 00:33:31,075
(6th try, Jae Suk)

999
00:33:31,076 --> 00:33:32,275
I've lost the hang of it.

1000
00:33:32,276 --> 00:33:36,486
(6th try, Jae Suk)

1001
00:33:36,686 --> 00:33:37,885
- You did it.
- Nice.

1002
00:33:37,886 --> 00:33:40,056
- Come on. Let's go.
- He'll succeed.

1003
00:33:40,356 --> 00:33:41,686
(Even Do Hoon succeeded!)

1004
00:33:43,986 --> 00:33:46,056
- Come on.
- Now then...

1005
00:33:46,096 --> 00:33:48,296
- You must succeed.
- Please.

1006
00:33:49,266 --> 00:33:51,735
(The golden opportunity has finally come!)

1007
00:33:51,736 --> 00:33:53,696
- You must succeed.
- Please.

1008
00:33:53,966 --> 00:33:56,335
Okay. I should grab near the edge.

1009
00:33:56,336 --> 00:33:58,106
Right here. Here I go.

1010
00:33:59,036 --> 00:34:00,176
(I can't watch him.)

1011
00:34:01,076 --> 00:34:02,506
(A supernatural power?)

1012
00:34:02,846 --> 00:34:04,105
- Here I go.
- He'll make it.

1013
00:34:04,106 --> 00:34:06,076
- Just toss it.
- I have a good feeling.

1014
00:34:12,019 --> 00:34:13,189
He'll make it.

1015
00:34:21,199 --> 00:34:23,339
(Yeon Seok finished it off.)

1016
00:34:23,899 --> 00:34:26,209
(Screaming)

1017
00:34:29,679 --> 00:34:30,978
(Succeeded Round 1!)

1018
00:34:30,979 --> 00:34:33,008
- Success!
- Yes!

1019
00:34:33,009 --> 00:34:34,148
(Succeeded Round 1!)

1020
00:34:34,149 --> 00:34:35,209
Success!

1021
00:34:36,109 --> 00:34:37,918
- We did it.
- Nice.

1022
00:34:37,919 --> 00:34:38,948
- We did it.
- We did.

1023
00:34:38,949 --> 00:34:41,219
- Well done.
- The Sony headphones.

1024
00:34:41,489 --> 00:34:42,818
It's yours now.

1025
00:34:42,819 --> 00:34:44,459
(Secured the Sony headphones!)

1026
00:34:44,719 --> 00:34:46,859
- Now then, we've succeeded.
- All right.

1027
00:34:47,029 --> 00:34:48,789
- Is it a go...
- Go!

1028
00:34:48,989 --> 00:34:50,059
Come on.

1029
00:34:50,612 --> 00:34:52,181
You saw how bad we are.

1030
00:34:52,182 --> 00:34:53,221
(Already used the coupon)

1031
00:34:53,222 --> 00:34:54,451
You totally did.

1032
00:34:54,452 --> 00:34:55,692
(Go despite only 4 tries left?)

1033
00:34:55,752 --> 00:34:58,421
- Please think again.
- The mission will get harder.

1034
00:34:58,422 --> 00:34:59,762
- I know.
- The prize...

1035
00:34:59,862 --> 00:35:00,962
- You know, right?
- Yes.

1036
00:35:01,192 --> 00:35:02,322
- But...
- Go!

1037
00:35:03,092 --> 00:35:04,562
- Without hesitation...
- Okay.

1038
00:35:05,032 --> 00:35:06,761
- She said, "Go."
- Please reconsider.

1039
00:35:06,762 --> 00:35:08,001
It's...

1040
00:35:08,002 --> 00:35:09,131
- No.
- Read it out loud.

1041
00:35:09,132 --> 00:35:11,202
- It's going to get difficult.
- Gosh.

1042
00:35:11,832 --> 00:35:14,041
"I record the error down to 1g of fried eggs..."

1043
00:35:14,042 --> 00:35:15,771
"every day. An iPad."

1044
00:35:15,772 --> 00:35:18,641
(Round 2 prize: iPad)

1045
00:35:18,642 --> 00:35:19,942
- An iPad?
- For real?

1046
00:35:20,642 --> 00:35:22,111
- It's cute.
- Not that one.

1047
00:35:22,112 --> 00:35:23,481
- How cute.
- It's the mini one.

1048
00:35:23,482 --> 00:35:24,812
(It's so cute.)

1049
00:35:25,112 --> 00:35:28,482
(Record the error of fried eggs down to 1g, iPad)

1050
00:35:28,682 --> 00:35:30,191
(Round 2)

1051
00:35:30,192 --> 00:35:33,062
(Egg Carton Relay)

1052
00:35:33,162 --> 00:35:34,861
(As a relay, )

1053
00:35:34,862 --> 00:35:39,931
(each player must take turns tossing from the first to the final row.)

1054
00:35:39,932 --> 00:35:42,661
(However, the time limit is 30 seconds.)

1055
00:35:42,662 --> 00:35:43,731
That's your mission.

1056
00:35:43,732 --> 00:35:44,802
- Toss?
- Five?

1057
00:35:45,472 --> 00:35:47,341
- Toss them one row at a time.
- What we did earlier.

1058
00:35:47,342 --> 00:35:49,242
- The one from earlier.
- One wrong move and...

1059
00:35:49,342 --> 00:35:50,411
This is way better.

1060
00:35:50,412 --> 00:35:52,172
(How Jae Suk and Do Hoon succeeded before)

1061
00:35:52,812 --> 00:35:55,211
Say that the balls fall off.

1062
00:35:55,212 --> 00:35:57,132
- Like some of them.
- Start from the top again.

1063
00:35:57,282 --> 00:35:58,481
Move them to the first row...

1064
00:35:58,482 --> 00:35:59,952
Finish within 30 seconds?

1065
00:36:00,282 --> 00:36:02,282
We'll lose time setting it up again.

1066
00:36:03,552 --> 00:36:05,352
(Practicing first)

1067
00:36:05,692 --> 00:36:07,092
Give us time to set it up.

1068
00:36:07,822 --> 00:36:09,792
I'm wasting time here.

1069
00:36:10,092 --> 00:36:12,062
- How'd that work?
- Start from the top?

1070
00:36:12,592 --> 00:36:14,401
- The time...
- Setting it up takes time.

1071
00:36:14,402 --> 00:36:15,462
- All set.
- Jae Suk.

1072
00:36:15,902 --> 00:36:17,531
- This is too...
- Just how, Jae Suk?

1073
00:36:17,532 --> 00:36:19,372
- I'm doomed.
- Look, setting it up...

1074
00:36:19,772 --> 00:36:22,341
- Why are you suddenly...
- I've lost it.

1075
00:36:22,342 --> 00:36:24,022
- I've lost the hang of it.
- This is bad.

1076
00:36:24,442 --> 00:36:26,011
It's impossible once you actually try it.

1077
00:36:26,012 --> 00:36:27,942
- I told you it was hard.
- Right?

1078
00:36:30,182 --> 00:36:31,382
Nice. Okay.

1079
00:36:32,482 --> 00:36:33,802
(Succeeded in the practice round)

1080
00:36:34,122 --> 00:36:35,921
- You're doing well, Do Hoon.
- I kind of get it.

1081
00:36:35,922 --> 00:36:38,322
- Okay.
- Don't use your arms.

1082
00:36:38,722 --> 00:36:39,761
Use your legs.

1083
00:36:39,762 --> 00:36:41,322
- Use the lower body?
- The lower body.

1084
00:36:41,792 --> 00:36:43,492
Bounce, like this.

1085
00:36:45,132 --> 00:36:47,002
- He knew how to do it.
- Use the legs.

1086
00:36:47,102 --> 00:36:48,201
- Okay.
- Shall we try?

1087
00:36:48,202 --> 00:36:49,771
- Let's try.
- Let's do it.

1088
00:36:49,772 --> 00:36:52,101
- In this order?
- The 7th try. In 1, 2, 3.

1089
00:36:52,102 --> 00:36:53,102
- Here we go!
- Here we go!

1090
00:36:53,103 --> 00:36:54,272
- Ready.
- You go.

1091
00:36:54,642 --> 00:36:55,772
- In this order.
- Ready.

1092
00:36:56,712 --> 00:36:57,812
Set.

1093
00:36:59,172 --> 00:37:01,011
(Within 30 seconds, )

1094
00:37:01,012 --> 00:37:03,912
(they must succeed the relay!)

1095
00:37:04,012 --> 00:37:05,082
Set.

1096
00:37:07,252 --> 00:37:08,282
Okay.

1097
00:37:10,922 --> 00:37:11,992
Good.

1098
00:37:16,262 --> 00:37:17,331
I'm done.

1099
00:37:17,332 --> 00:37:18,692
(Succeeded smoothly up to Jae Suk)

1100
00:37:21,702 --> 00:37:23,001
- We've got plenty of time.
- Good.

1101
00:37:23,002 --> 00:37:24,102
All right.

1102
00:37:24,832 --> 00:37:26,401
Good. All right.

1103
00:37:26,402 --> 00:37:27,571
- We've got plenty of time.
- Good.

1104
00:37:27,572 --> 00:37:28,572
All right.

1105
00:37:28,573 --> 00:37:29,888
(Yeon Seok is the only one left.)

1106
00:37:29,912 --> 00:37:31,042
All right.

1107
00:37:36,552 --> 00:37:37,812
Come on. Let's go.

1108
00:37:45,222 --> 00:37:46,662
The time!

1109
00:37:49,492 --> 00:37:50,961
(Cleared the mission in one go!)

1110
00:37:50,962 --> 00:37:52,662
- The time!
- Yes!

1111
00:37:53,562 --> 00:37:57,032
(Succeeded perfectly in 17 seconds!)

1112
00:37:58,732 --> 00:38:00,502
I told you we'd succeed!

1113
00:38:00,802 --> 00:38:03,412
- Yes!
- Nice!

1114
00:38:04,072 --> 00:38:05,242
We did it! 17 seconds!

1115
00:38:05,842 --> 00:38:06,962
- Seventeen seconds!
- Okay!

1116
00:38:07,512 --> 00:38:09,411
(A self-cannon salute)

1117
00:38:09,412 --> 00:38:10,512
What are you doing?

1118
00:38:11,352 --> 00:38:12,451
What are you doing?

1119
00:38:12,452 --> 00:38:13,692
My way of saying, "Let's stop."

1120
00:38:13,882 --> 00:38:15,981
- Let's stop. We've done enough.
- Just how all of a sudden?

1121
00:38:15,982 --> 00:38:17,091
(Surprisingly, they succeeded Round 2 in 1 go.)

1122
00:38:17,092 --> 00:38:19,052
- We've made it.
- Just how did we do it?

1123
00:38:19,222 --> 00:38:20,691
- How many tries are left?
- Stop.

1124
00:38:20,692 --> 00:38:22,722
- You should stop.
- Stop.

1125
00:38:23,062 --> 00:38:24,832
- How many tries are left?
- Yu Jeong.

1126
00:38:25,032 --> 00:38:26,932
- Three times.
- Stop.

1127
00:38:27,232 --> 00:38:28,302
Please.

1128
00:38:28,462 --> 00:38:31,471
- It gets way more difficult.
- The difficulty shoots up.

1129
00:38:31,472 --> 00:38:34,102
- All right.
- We've done a few seasons...

1130
00:38:34,642 --> 00:38:36,441
- and have never succeeded.
- Yu Jeong, go or...

1131
00:38:36,442 --> 00:38:37,512
Go!

1132
00:38:38,372 --> 00:38:39,571
It's Round Three.

1133
00:38:39,572 --> 00:38:41,741
- Go!
- Unbelievable.

1134
00:38:41,742 --> 00:38:43,652
It's Round Three.

1135
00:38:43,682 --> 00:38:44,982
- But...
- Sorry.

1136
00:38:45,252 --> 00:38:46,722
- What was in the eggs?
- Just why?

1137
00:38:47,052 --> 00:38:48,581
- What's gotten into her?
- The eggs...

1138
00:38:48,582 --> 00:38:50,292
What did you put in the eggs?

1139
00:38:50,852 --> 00:38:52,852
Why would you choose go?

1140
00:38:53,322 --> 00:38:54,792
You might lose all your prizes.

1141
00:38:55,092 --> 00:38:56,191
- It's okay.
- It's okay.

1142
00:38:56,192 --> 00:38:57,262
I don't get it.

1143
00:38:57,392 --> 00:38:58,791
- Bye.
- I'm losing it.

1144
00:38:58,792 --> 00:39:00,001
- It's not back and forth, is it?
- Okay.

1145
00:39:00,002 --> 00:39:01,231
Let's check out Round Three's prize.

1146
00:39:01,232 --> 00:39:03,072
We were lucky in Round Two.

1147
00:39:03,502 --> 00:39:06,541
"Take care of the smell of eggs permeating the clothes,"

1148
00:39:06,542 --> 00:39:07,871
"LG steam closet."

1149
00:39:07,872 --> 00:39:08,941
(Round 3 prize: Steam closet)

1150
00:39:08,942 --> 00:39:10,411
- Don't tell me...
- A styler?

1151
00:39:10,412 --> 00:39:11,542
- Yes!
- A styler?

1152
00:39:12,512 --> 00:39:13,741
I see it coming.

1153
00:39:13,742 --> 00:39:14,982
- It's being delivered.
- What?

1154
00:39:18,252 --> 00:39:19,412
- For real?
- Help him.

1155
00:39:19,782 --> 00:39:20,982
A styler?

1156
00:39:21,582 --> 00:39:22,682
It's huge.

1157
00:39:23,592 --> 00:39:25,352
How hard is it for the prize to be a styler?

1158
00:39:25,852 --> 00:39:28,622
(Deodorizing the permeated smell of eggs, a steam closet)

1159
00:39:28,722 --> 00:39:30,091
(Round 3)

1160
00:39:30,092 --> 00:39:32,061
(Move the balls several rows at a time.)

1161
00:39:32,062 --> 00:39:34,061
(Toss the balls in order.)

1162
00:39:34,062 --> 00:39:35,801
(1st player: 1 row)

1163
00:39:35,802 --> 00:39:37,471
(2nd player: 2 rows)

1164
00:39:37,472 --> 00:39:39,131
(3rd player: 3 rows)

1165
00:39:39,132 --> 00:39:42,172
(4th player: 4 rows)

1166
00:39:43,642 --> 00:39:44,742
I don't get it.

1167
00:39:45,312 --> 00:39:46,382
Do what?

1168
00:39:46,542 --> 00:39:47,612
- What?
- Do what?

1169
00:39:47,882 --> 00:39:49,082
- In 1 go?
- The 1st player...

1170
00:39:49,282 --> 00:39:52,152
I get it. You move them to here, I move them to here,

1171
00:39:52,352 --> 00:39:54,081
Do Hoon moves them to here, and Yeon Seok moves them to here.

1172
00:39:54,082 --> 00:39:56,622
Do Hoon moves them to here, and Yeon Seok moves them to here.

1173
00:39:56,722 --> 00:39:57,992
I see.

1174
00:39:58,152 --> 00:40:00,691
- One player has to...
- So... When it's my turn.

1175
00:40:00,692 --> 00:40:01,692
(The 2nd player has to move them 2 rows down.)

1176
00:40:01,693 --> 00:40:02,791
So...

1177
00:40:02,792 --> 00:40:04,592
One player has to send them to the last row?

1178
00:40:05,292 --> 00:40:07,331
This will be your row, Yeon Seok.

1179
00:40:07,332 --> 00:40:09,052
The 1st player has to move them 1 row down.

1180
00:40:09,202 --> 00:40:12,001
The 3rd player has to move them 3 rows down.

1181
00:40:12,002 --> 00:40:14,001
If the ball leaves the hole or falls, it's a fail.

1182
00:40:14,002 --> 00:40:15,802
- Is it possible?
- So to this row.

1183
00:40:16,712 --> 00:40:18,012
- Yu Jeong.
- Yes?

1184
00:40:18,942 --> 00:40:20,381
It may be a mean way of putting it,

1185
00:40:20,382 --> 00:40:21,822
but you've brought this on yourself.

1186
00:40:22,412 --> 00:40:24,912
We promise to do our best.

1187
00:40:25,112 --> 00:40:26,722
We'll do our best, but this is...

1188
00:40:27,082 --> 00:40:28,552
- Got it?
- Yes.

1189
00:40:29,452 --> 00:40:30,891
Moving four rows is really tough.

1190
00:40:30,892 --> 00:40:32,752
From the top to the bottom.

1191
00:40:34,522 --> 00:40:37,631
That's it. Do Hoon is to move them to row three.

1192
00:40:37,632 --> 00:40:39,231
(I did it.)

1193
00:40:39,232 --> 00:40:41,101
- With your carton?
- Yes.

1194
00:40:41,102 --> 00:40:42,602
- It's possible, but...
- What?

1195
00:40:42,762 --> 00:40:44,632
- I did it.
- Don't throw them into the holes.

1196
00:40:44,772 --> 00:40:46,172
- Let's do it.
- It's...

1197
00:40:46,502 --> 00:40:48,342
Throw the balls up.

1198
00:40:48,742 --> 00:40:50,472
- Move the carton.
- Yes, move the carton.

1199
00:40:51,042 --> 00:40:52,172
Once, to here.

1200
00:40:52,212 --> 00:40:53,341
(Failed, but so close)

1201
00:40:53,342 --> 00:40:54,381
He'll make it next time.

1202
00:40:54,382 --> 00:40:56,412
- Done. A miracle will happen.
- Yes.

1203
00:40:56,652 --> 00:40:57,812
Let's cheer each other on.

1204
00:40:58,052 --> 00:40:59,451
- In 1, 2, 3.
- In 1, 2, 3.

1205
00:40:59,452 --> 00:41:00,521
- Let's go!
- Let's go!

1206
00:41:00,522 --> 00:41:01,651
It's the eighth try.

1207
00:41:01,652 --> 00:41:03,321
- You can do it.
- You've got it.

1208
00:41:03,322 --> 00:41:05,452
- Yes, just as I did earlier.
- All right.

1209
00:41:05,822 --> 00:41:06,961
- Go?
- Go.

1210
00:41:06,962 --> 00:41:08,022
Ready.

1211
00:41:11,562 --> 00:41:12,662
Set.

1212
00:41:13,762 --> 00:41:15,232
- Going first is... Yes.
- Nice.

1213
00:41:20,002 --> 00:41:21,072
Yes.

1214
00:41:21,572 --> 00:41:22,642
Nice.

1215
00:41:25,242 --> 00:41:26,271
Please.

1216
00:41:26,272 --> 00:41:28,112
Come on.

1217
00:41:29,112 --> 00:41:30,952
- Please.
- Come on.

1218
00:41:31,482 --> 00:41:32,781
(Ready to celebrate)

1219
00:41:32,782 --> 00:41:33,952
Please.

1220
00:41:50,002 --> 00:41:53,602
(They succeeded Round 3 in the 1st shot as well!)

1221
00:41:56,712 --> 00:41:58,612
(Another self-cannon salute)

1222
00:41:58,912 --> 00:42:01,542
(Screaming)

1223
00:42:03,652 --> 00:42:05,012
Unbelievable!

1224
00:42:06,652 --> 00:42:10,052
(A perfect teamplay of the four players)

1225
00:42:11,722 --> 00:42:13,561
- To think we'd do it!
- To think we'd do it!

1226
00:42:13,562 --> 00:42:15,362
- To think we'd do it!
- To think we'd do it!

1227
00:42:16,492 --> 00:42:17,691
(Touched)

1228
00:42:17,692 --> 00:42:18,792
Thank you.

1229
00:42:19,262 --> 00:42:21,202
All right. Round Three.

1230
00:42:21,332 --> 00:42:23,232
- Round 3, success!
- Round 3, success!

1231
00:42:24,502 --> 00:42:26,642
(Dancing)

1232
00:42:26,742 --> 00:42:29,002
Round Three, success!

1233
00:42:29,342 --> 00:42:30,712
We did it.

1234
00:42:30,812 --> 00:42:33,072
(Greeting the prize with a bright smile)

1235
00:42:33,512 --> 00:42:35,912
- It's...
- Take your jacket off.

1236
00:42:36,242 --> 00:42:38,051
- Put it all in there.
- Gosh.

1237
00:42:38,052 --> 00:42:40,622
(The Round 3 prize, steam closet, arrives.)

1238
00:42:41,882 --> 00:42:43,352
This is hard to believe.

1239
00:42:44,852 --> 00:42:46,351
- Even I was shocked.
- It's...

1240
00:42:46,352 --> 00:42:47,762
With this, Yu Jeong,

1241
00:42:48,162 --> 00:42:51,131
you also get the Round Three prize.

1242
00:42:51,132 --> 00:42:52,838
(Secured headphones, iPad, and a steam closet!)

1243
00:42:52,862 --> 00:42:54,161
(Congratulations!)

1244
00:42:54,162 --> 00:42:56,231
Yu Jeong's... How do I put it?

1245
00:42:56,232 --> 00:42:57,571
Her boldness...

1246
00:42:57,572 --> 00:42:58,871
- that knows no hesitation.
- Awesome.

1247
00:42:58,872 --> 00:43:01,512
What made you decide to push on to Round Three without hesitation?

1248
00:43:01,642 --> 00:43:02,701
Before we started,

1249
00:43:02,702 --> 00:43:03,741
- Yes?
- I had made up my mind.

1250
00:43:03,742 --> 00:43:05,742
"If there are 2 tries left, it's 3 go or die."

1251
00:43:06,112 --> 00:43:07,741
- Unconditionally?
- Unconditionally.

1252
00:43:07,742 --> 00:43:08,842
Either way, it's not mine.

1253
00:43:09,412 --> 00:43:11,693
- Either way, you never had any.
- Yes, we never had any.

1254
00:43:11,912 --> 00:43:12,912
So let's go till Round Three.

1255
00:43:12,913 --> 00:43:14,381
- All right.
- Amazing.

1256
00:43:14,382 --> 00:43:15,681
(Succeeded the New Year's 1st sparetime up to Round 3)

1257
00:43:15,682 --> 00:43:17,022
I'm shook.

1258
00:43:17,522 --> 00:43:18,751
Is this what it's like?

1259
00:43:18,752 --> 00:43:20,692
- My body keeps shaking.
- Yes.

1260
00:43:20,892 --> 00:43:22,621
- He's hyper.
- It's normal.

1261
00:43:22,622 --> 00:43:25,532
You won't stop shaking until bedtime.

1262
00:43:26,562 --> 00:43:27,832
My body won't calm down.

1263
00:43:28,562 --> 00:43:31,471
Really, this was incredible.

1264
00:43:31,472 --> 00:43:32,501
(We were incredible.)

1265
00:43:32,502 --> 00:43:34,902
- This is so...
- We had amazing teamwork.

1266
00:43:35,342 --> 00:43:37,341
That was incredible teamwork.

1267
00:43:37,342 --> 00:43:38,822
How can this happen in the first one?

1268
00:43:39,212 --> 00:43:41,812
- Do Hoon.
- Round Three was so difficult.

1269
00:43:42,042 --> 00:43:44,012
It was almost impossible.

1270
00:43:45,312 --> 00:43:47,121
We're meeting...

1271
00:43:47,122 --> 00:43:48,921
our next Whenever Guest at 3pm, right?

1272
00:43:48,922 --> 00:43:50,752
I have to see where it is.

1273
00:43:51,522 --> 00:43:52,721
It's currently 1:06pm.

1274
00:43:52,722 --> 00:43:53,991
I feel so good, though.

1275
00:43:53,992 --> 00:43:55,291
(Now that they have 2 hours, they'll have lunch.)

1276
00:43:55,292 --> 00:43:57,861
Do Hoon, is there a place nearby that you often visit?

1277
00:43:57,862 --> 00:44:00,131
- Yes, there are a few.
- Okay.

1278
00:44:00,132 --> 00:44:03,331
The one that should be open now is that way.

1279
00:44:03,332 --> 00:44:04,971
- What do they sell?
- Kimchi stew.

1280
00:44:04,972 --> 00:44:06,472
- Kimchi stew.
- Kimchi stew.

1281
00:44:07,342 --> 00:44:08,342
(Not that enthusiastic)

1282
00:44:08,343 --> 00:44:10,442
Near Seonjeongneung Station...

1283
00:44:10,472 --> 00:44:12,472
How about a Korean buffet?

1284
00:44:13,172 --> 00:44:14,711
- Korean buffet?
- Korean buffet?

1285
00:44:14,712 --> 00:44:16,281
(A Korean buffet?)

1286
00:44:16,282 --> 00:44:18,212
We do have to take the bus later.

1287
00:44:18,482 --> 00:44:19,651
It takes about 20 minutes.

1288
00:44:19,652 --> 00:44:20,798
Should we get there first, then?

1289
00:44:20,822 --> 00:44:22,421
- Should we?
- Why don't we eat in Yeoksam-dong?

1290
00:44:22,422 --> 00:44:24,121
If we do... Let's go there, then.

1291
00:44:24,122 --> 00:44:26,021
- Yes, let's get there first.
- Yes.

1292
00:44:26,022 --> 00:44:27,022
(They'll think about what to eat later.)

1293
00:44:27,023 --> 00:44:28,261
- Or should we...
- What else is there?

1294
00:44:28,262 --> 00:44:29,362
Eat jjamppong?

1295
00:44:30,232 --> 00:44:31,332
- Jjamppong?
- Jjamppong?

1296
00:44:32,362 --> 00:44:34,361
Earlier, we had...

1297
00:44:34,362 --> 00:44:36,801
- You're right.
- bread and stuff.

1298
00:44:36,802 --> 00:44:39,201
- And egg tarts.
- We feel bloated.

1299
00:44:39,202 --> 00:44:40,202
You're right.

1300
00:44:40,272 --> 00:44:42,672
You said you wanted to eat jjamppong, right?

1301
00:44:42,972 --> 00:44:45,271
There's a good jjajangmyeon place down the street.

1302
00:44:45,272 --> 00:44:46,571
Is there? Should we check it out?

1303
00:44:46,572 --> 00:44:47,711
Let's check it out.

1304
00:44:47,712 --> 00:44:49,241
Let's satisfy our hunger first.

1305
00:44:49,242 --> 00:44:51,611
- Let's satisfy our hunger first.
- Yes. Let's go.

1306
00:44:51,612 --> 00:44:53,252
Do Hoon knows the area...

1307
00:44:53,922 --> 00:44:55,452
as he lives here.

1308
00:44:55,922 --> 00:44:57,021
Right.

1309
00:44:57,022 --> 00:44:58,992
It feels strange that I'm walking here with you?

1310
00:44:59,652 --> 00:45:00,661
- Does it?
- Yes.

1311
00:45:00,662 --> 00:45:01,868
(I'm walking in my neighborhood with them?)

1312
00:45:01,892 --> 00:45:04,031
That would be nice. It must be on the second floor.

1313
00:45:04,032 --> 00:45:05,161
Yes, it's over there.

1314
00:45:05,162 --> 00:45:06,661
- Oh, it's that place?
- Yes.

1315
00:45:06,662 --> 00:45:08,861
- That place is...
- It's really famous.

1316
00:45:08,862 --> 00:45:10,471
- They sell great food.
- They do.

1317
00:45:10,472 --> 00:45:11,671
They serve delicious food.

1318
00:45:11,672 --> 00:45:13,001
- It's the main restaurant.
- Or...

1319
00:45:13,002 --> 00:45:14,002
(Looking around)

1320
00:45:14,003 --> 00:45:15,541
Should I come up with a different one?

1321
00:45:15,542 --> 00:45:16,542
No.

1322
00:45:17,272 --> 00:45:19,472
I saw your breath and thought you were smoking.

1323
00:45:20,742 --> 00:45:22,741
He had his hand down, so I thought...

1324
00:45:22,742 --> 00:45:23,852
(Coincidental timing)

1325
00:45:24,082 --> 00:45:25,481
"Should I come up with something else?"

1326
00:45:25,482 --> 00:45:26,751
(That was my breath.)

1327
00:45:26,752 --> 00:45:27,922
I thought, "Is he smoking?"

1328
00:45:28,322 --> 00:45:29,721
I was going to put my hand in the pocket, but stopped.

1329
00:45:29,722 --> 00:45:31,592
Okay. That's good.

1330
00:45:32,722 --> 00:45:34,461
(They arrive at Do Hoon's favorite Chinese restaurant.)

1331
00:45:34,462 --> 00:45:35,822
Here it is.

1332
00:45:36,292 --> 00:45:38,191
- Hello.
- Goodness.

1333
00:45:38,192 --> 00:45:40,401
- Do Hoon comes here...
- It's been a while, hasn't it?

1334
00:45:40,402 --> 00:45:42,862
- Yes, I brought them here.
- I see.

1335
00:45:43,572 --> 00:45:45,771
- Okay. Thank you.
- Thank you.

1336
00:45:45,772 --> 00:45:46,902
They're giving us a room?

1337
00:45:47,142 --> 00:45:49,071
After passing Round Three,

1338
00:45:49,072 --> 00:45:51,472
- This is for passing Round Three.
- we're living in luxury.

1339
00:45:51,542 --> 00:45:52,842
We're even getting a room.

1340
00:45:52,912 --> 00:45:55,082
We get the whole room when we pass Round Three.

1341
00:45:56,912 --> 00:45:58,992
This is nice. It's been so long since I last came...

1342
00:45:59,112 --> 00:46:01,451
- to a Chinese restaurant.
- This is...

1343
00:46:01,452 --> 00:46:03,051
It's all thanks to Do Hoon.

1344
00:46:03,052 --> 00:46:04,121
(Do Hoon did a great job with coming up with this place.)

1345
00:46:04,122 --> 00:46:06,492
We have the luxury of eating here, thanks to you.

1346
00:46:07,322 --> 00:46:08,792
Should we get a multi-course meal?

1347
00:46:10,532 --> 00:46:11,532
(Inhaling sharply)

1348
00:46:11,533 --> 00:46:13,132
These are pretty expensive.

1349
00:46:13,562 --> 00:46:15,601
Why don't we get one tangsuyuk?

1350
00:46:15,602 --> 00:46:16,632
I'd like that.

1351
00:46:16,702 --> 00:46:18,271
- I'll have jjamppong.
- I'll have jjajang.

1352
00:46:18,272 --> 00:46:20,031
- I'll also have yuni jjajang.
- And Yeon Shik?

1353
00:46:20,032 --> 00:46:22,241
- I'll try white jjamppong.
- Sure. Try it.

1354
00:46:22,242 --> 00:46:24,241
A medium-sized kkanpung shrimp.

1355
00:46:24,242 --> 00:46:25,242
(They ordered a bunch to celebrate passing Round 3.)

1356
00:46:25,243 --> 00:46:26,283
This was the right choice.

1357
00:46:26,812 --> 00:46:29,342
How is your wife doing?

1358
00:46:29,482 --> 00:46:32,381
She loved "Dear X."

1359
00:46:32,382 --> 00:46:33,481
- Seriously?
- Yes.

1360
00:46:33,482 --> 00:46:35,082
- What did she say?
- I said,

1361
00:46:35,682 --> 00:46:37,751
"Is Do Hoon You Jung's lackey?"

1362
00:46:37,752 --> 00:46:38,991
(In the show)

1363
00:46:38,992 --> 00:46:40,822
And she said, "No!"

1364
00:46:41,392 --> 00:46:43,861
Right. You were recently in "Dear X" with You Jung.

1365
00:46:43,862 --> 00:46:45,791
- You're right.
- She was like, "No, he isn't!"

1366
00:46:45,792 --> 00:46:47,432
She said Do Hook looked so cute in it.

1367
00:46:47,562 --> 00:46:49,861
There are so many platforms nowadays,

1368
00:46:49,862 --> 00:46:51,701
so it's hard...

1369
00:46:51,702 --> 00:46:52,831
to watch all the dramas.

1370
00:46:52,832 --> 00:46:54,401
- You're right. There are so many.
- So many.

1371
00:46:54,402 --> 00:46:57,271
How do you always watch all of them?

1372
00:46:57,272 --> 00:46:59,612
My day ends at 3pm, so there isn't much to do.

1373
00:47:00,212 --> 00:47:01,812
So, I just watch shows all day.

1374
00:47:02,342 --> 00:47:05,711
If Yeon Seok is in something, I watch that.

1375
00:47:05,712 --> 00:47:08,282
- He always gives me a call.
- Here's your food.

1376
00:47:08,982 --> 00:47:10,421
So, this is kkanpung shrimp.

1377
00:47:10,422 --> 00:47:12,492
- It is.
- That one looks great.

1378
00:47:13,022 --> 00:47:14,122
Thank you for the food.

1379
00:47:14,922 --> 00:47:16,021
In order of age.

1380
00:47:16,022 --> 00:47:17,762
Don't do that.

1381
00:47:19,092 --> 00:47:20,932
Please respect us when we want you to.

1382
00:47:22,362 --> 00:47:25,932
When we want you to respect us, you scream, "That's not fair!"

1383
00:47:27,042 --> 00:47:29,171
(Yeon Seok tries a piece of kkanpung shrimp.)

1384
00:47:29,172 --> 00:47:31,341
This is good.

1385
00:47:31,342 --> 00:47:32,372
It's good.

1386
00:47:33,582 --> 00:47:36,882
(It tastes better because they just passed Round 3.)

1387
00:47:37,052 --> 00:47:39,333
Kkangpung shrimp tastes pretty good as it's been a while.

1388
00:47:39,552 --> 00:47:41,582
- Do you want another one?
- No.

1389
00:47:42,322 --> 00:47:43,322
You can have them all.

1390
00:47:43,323 --> 00:47:45,322
He eats 15 eggs.

1391
00:47:45,592 --> 00:47:47,561
He hasn't had Chinese food in ages.

1392
00:47:47,562 --> 00:47:49,122
(He should be eating a lot at his age.)

1393
00:47:49,392 --> 00:47:51,191
Based on the shooting date,

1394
00:47:51,192 --> 00:47:53,161
is this my second time here this year?

1395
00:47:53,162 --> 00:47:55,861
You were on the show twice in 2025.

1396
00:47:55,862 --> 00:47:57,382
And I was on the show twice last year.

1397
00:47:57,902 --> 00:47:58,902
Gosh.

1398
00:47:58,903 --> 00:48:01,442
Why do they keep inviting me whenever possible?

1399
00:48:01,872 --> 00:48:03,472
Because you have time.

1400
00:48:03,612 --> 00:48:04,642
That's true.

1401
00:48:05,242 --> 00:48:06,812
I don't have that many regular shows.

1402
00:48:07,412 --> 00:48:08,812
(Laughing)

1403
00:48:09,482 --> 00:48:10,911
You know,

1404
00:48:10,912 --> 00:48:14,152
watching these variety shows,

1405
00:48:14,482 --> 00:48:16,482
I have huge respect for you guys.

1406
00:48:16,682 --> 00:48:18,421
- I wasn't on many, - You were on some shows.

1407
00:48:18,422 --> 00:48:20,152
But being on a few variety shows,

1408
00:48:20,562 --> 00:48:21,921
I feel the pressure...

1409
00:48:21,922 --> 00:48:24,531
of keeping things going smoothly.

1410
00:48:24,532 --> 00:48:25,631
- Right.
- Right.

1411
00:48:25,632 --> 00:48:27,802
To actors like us, variety shows are...

1412
00:48:28,102 --> 00:48:30,061
- harder because there's no script.
- You're right.

1413
00:48:30,062 --> 00:48:32,232
We're used to having scripts.

1414
00:48:33,742 --> 00:48:35,302
But you shouldn't say things like that.

1415
00:48:36,472 --> 00:48:37,918
- I don't find it difficult.
- Right.

1416
00:48:37,942 --> 00:48:38,971
You don't get to say that, at least.

1417
00:48:38,972 --> 00:48:40,812
Now, I find it tougher when there is a script.

1418
00:48:41,742 --> 00:48:43,412
What did you say yesterday? Yesterday...

1419
00:48:43,852 --> 00:48:45,982
I texted him, and...

1420
00:48:46,012 --> 00:48:47,382
- You texted Tae Hyun?
- Yes.

1421
00:48:47,752 --> 00:48:50,251
"I'm a little nervous. I'm not sure if I'll fit in."

1422
00:48:50,252 --> 00:48:52,533
He wrote, "I don't know either. I just go with the flow."

1423
00:48:53,252 --> 00:48:55,322
That's the right way. You just go with it.

1424
00:48:55,962 --> 00:48:57,092
Just go with the flow.

1425
00:48:57,432 --> 00:48:59,112
You saw earlier. That's how I realized it.

1426
00:48:59,192 --> 00:49:00,831
Watching Yu Jeong, I thought, "Fine, let's go."

1427
00:49:00,832 --> 00:49:01,832
Go!

1428
00:49:02,532 --> 00:49:03,601
- Right.
- She was reckless.

1429
00:49:03,602 --> 00:49:05,702
You just go for it if you can take it.

1430
00:49:07,242 --> 00:49:10,001
She said that she didn't think the prizes belonged to her.

1431
00:49:10,002 --> 00:49:11,411
- Right.
- It wasn't hers, to begin with...

1432
00:49:11,412 --> 00:49:14,041
Right. That mindset.

1433
00:49:14,042 --> 00:49:16,312
Those simple remarks...

1434
00:49:17,082 --> 00:49:18,211
will sometimes surprise you.

1435
00:49:18,212 --> 00:49:20,052
She was confident that she wouldn't regret it.

1436
00:49:20,882 --> 00:49:22,222
Do Hoon, where are you from?

1437
00:49:22,422 --> 00:49:25,221
I was born in Pyeongtaek,

1438
00:49:25,222 --> 00:49:27,661
but I had to move every year in my childhood.

1439
00:49:27,662 --> 00:49:28,662
Why?

1440
00:49:28,862 --> 00:49:31,531
My father was a soldier when I was a kid.

1441
00:49:31,532 --> 00:49:33,831
- Oh, I see.
- Yes, they make you move.

1442
00:49:33,832 --> 00:49:36,161
The company he joined after retirement,

1443
00:49:36,162 --> 00:49:37,372
appointed him...

1444
00:49:37,502 --> 00:49:41,041
in Gangwon Province and Gyeongsang Province.

1445
00:49:41,042 --> 00:49:43,041
The last city we settled down in was Yongin.

1446
00:49:43,042 --> 00:49:44,211
- Yongin.
- But...

1447
00:49:44,212 --> 00:49:47,041
when you often move for your place of work,

1448
00:49:47,042 --> 00:49:48,681
- it's tough for children...
- It's tough.

1449
00:49:48,682 --> 00:49:50,141
Who have to go to school.

1450
00:49:50,142 --> 00:49:51,758
They move every time they start making friends.

1451
00:49:51,782 --> 00:49:55,452
I think I was in second grade. In the exam, there was a question...

1452
00:49:55,622 --> 00:49:58,091
that said, "Write the things that changed..."

1453
00:49:58,092 --> 00:49:59,521
"in the new semester."

1454
00:49:59,522 --> 00:50:02,491
Other kids normally wrote, "Friends and classrooms."

1455
00:50:02,492 --> 00:50:04,062
But I wrote, "School."

1456
00:50:04,232 --> 00:50:05,461
Because you had to keep transferring.

1457
00:50:05,462 --> 00:50:08,231
And the teacher said it was wrong and didn't give me a point.

1458
00:50:08,232 --> 00:50:09,232
(He still remembers it vividly.)

1459
00:50:09,233 --> 00:50:11,431
- That was a bit...
- Now that I think about it,

1460
00:50:11,432 --> 00:50:12,471
it's heartbreaking.

1461
00:50:12,472 --> 00:50:13,801
My mom was pretty sad back then.

1462
00:50:13,802 --> 00:50:16,272
Just because you weren't normal...

1463
00:50:16,542 --> 00:50:18,311
Do Hoon, were you born in 1998?

1464
00:50:18,312 --> 00:50:19,872
- Yes.
- In 1998.

1465
00:50:20,142 --> 00:50:21,281
Everyone brings up the IMF Crisis...

1466
00:50:21,282 --> 00:50:22,381
when you say you were born in 1998, don't they?

1467
00:50:22,382 --> 00:50:23,382
You're right.

1468
00:50:24,312 --> 00:50:25,781
To those born in 2002, we bring up World Cup games.

1469
00:50:25,782 --> 00:50:28,221
Yes. "You were born during the IMF Crisis."

1470
00:50:28,222 --> 00:50:29,481
"I entered college in 1998."

1471
00:50:29,482 --> 00:50:30,591
(The things that those born in 1998 hear)

1472
00:50:30,592 --> 00:50:33,252
"Did you watch World Cup games? Do you remember?"

1473
00:50:34,022 --> 00:50:35,621
I'm sure you vaguely remember it.

1474
00:50:35,622 --> 00:50:37,661
- I remember nothing from 2002.
- Nothing?

1475
00:50:37,662 --> 00:50:38,662
That sounds about right.

1476
00:50:38,663 --> 00:50:40,902
It was so joyous in the 2002 soccer games.

1477
00:50:41,962 --> 00:50:43,032
It was fun.

1478
00:50:43,632 --> 00:50:47,042
- It was a glorious year.
- I was on "Terrifying Kungkungta."

1479
00:50:47,672 --> 00:50:49,371
I was on that show.

1480
00:50:49,372 --> 00:50:52,442
There were many people cheering on the streets of Samseong-dong,

1481
00:50:52,642 --> 00:50:54,141
but they were also kids.

1482
00:50:54,142 --> 00:50:56,781
Those kids were Do Hoon's age.

1483
00:50:56,782 --> 00:50:57,782
(He was a kid in 2002.)

1484
00:50:57,783 --> 00:50:59,582
- A kid?
- Those kids.

1485
00:50:59,782 --> 00:51:02,063
You know, 4 or 5 years old. I was like, "You're so cute!"

1486
00:51:02,352 --> 00:51:03,821
"So cute!"

1487
00:51:03,822 --> 00:51:07,361
And the ones that went, "Hey, there's Yoo Jae Suk,"

1488
00:51:07,362 --> 00:51:08,661
were Yeon Seok's age.

1489
00:51:08,662 --> 00:51:09,662
(He was a high school senior in 2002.)

1490
00:51:09,663 --> 00:51:10,891
Oh, that's why you were pinching my ear!

1491
00:51:10,892 --> 00:51:13,191
(Yeon Seok must have been quite playful then.)

1492
00:51:13,192 --> 00:51:15,631
Tae Hyun was in his early 20s at the time.

1493
00:51:15,632 --> 00:51:17,131
I was working hard in 2002.

1494
00:51:17,132 --> 00:51:19,931
- Right. He had just made his debut.
- Right.

1495
00:51:19,932 --> 00:51:22,541
No, that's not true. I was in my prime.

1496
00:51:22,542 --> 00:51:24,972
- Were you?
- Yes, back in 2002.

1497
00:51:25,072 --> 00:51:26,911
- Oh, you're right.
- I was living the life...

1498
00:51:26,912 --> 00:51:28,911
- after "My Sassy Girl."
- Was it after "My Sassy Girl?"

1499
00:51:28,912 --> 00:51:31,981
I couldn't be stopped by anyone.

1500
00:51:31,982 --> 00:51:33,181
"Who's that?"

1501
00:51:33,182 --> 00:51:35,252
"Who? Yoo Jae Suk? Tell him to get out of here!"

1502
00:51:35,622 --> 00:51:38,022
"Who does he think he is?"

1503
00:51:38,122 --> 00:51:39,792
"A grasshopper?"

1504
00:51:40,122 --> 00:51:42,091
"Yoo Jae Suk?" I was so famous.

1505
00:51:42,092 --> 00:51:43,092
- He's right, though.
- Yes.

1506
00:51:43,093 --> 00:51:44,131
- Tae Hyun...
- Do Hoon.

1507
00:51:44,132 --> 00:51:45,991
You heard about how popular he was, right?

1508
00:51:45,992 --> 00:51:47,431
I've heard a lot about it.

1509
00:51:47,432 --> 00:51:49,502
- What are you talking about?
- Tae Hyun was...

1510
00:51:49,562 --> 00:51:51,831
so popular that the whole street was packed...

1511
00:51:51,832 --> 00:51:54,041
whenever he appeared.

1512
00:51:54,042 --> 00:51:55,542
He was like Korea's first love.

1513
00:51:56,002 --> 00:51:57,412
Even his manager...

1514
00:51:57,842 --> 00:52:00,271
drove the most expensive sports car...

1515
00:52:00,272 --> 00:52:02,482
- Come on.
- at the time.

1516
00:52:02,812 --> 00:52:04,381
- He was...
- We were all...

1517
00:52:04,382 --> 00:52:05,682
out of our minds.

1518
00:52:09,082 --> 00:52:10,082
(The meal is over.)

1519
00:52:10,083 --> 00:52:11,283
That was a great meal, though.

1520
00:52:12,622 --> 00:52:14,191
I don't know who will pay today, but...

1521
00:52:14,192 --> 00:52:16,291
- The bill will be pretty high.
- It will be.

1522
00:52:16,292 --> 00:52:17,391
(The bill will be bigger than usual.)

1523
00:52:17,392 --> 00:52:18,792
- It will be.
- I hope it's not me.

1524
00:52:18,992 --> 00:52:19,992
I brought my wallet.

1525
00:52:19,993 --> 00:52:21,032
- Good.
- Yes.

1526
00:52:22,362 --> 00:52:23,632
What kind of game can we play?

1527
00:52:24,272 --> 00:52:26,472
We all drink a cup of coke and hold it in.

1528
00:52:26,872 --> 00:52:27,971
That's not a bad idea.

1529
00:52:27,972 --> 00:52:30,241
We drink the whole glass and hold back the burp.

1530
00:52:30,242 --> 00:52:32,171
- That's good.
- That's so primitive.

1531
00:52:32,172 --> 00:52:33,312
Primitive is good.

1532
00:52:33,412 --> 00:52:35,458
I already feel like burping, and I didn't even drink it yet.

1533
00:52:35,482 --> 00:52:36,842
You can't drink it slowly.

1534
00:52:37,552 --> 00:52:38,611
All right.

1535
00:52:38,612 --> 00:52:39,951
(Deciding who pays)

1536
00:52:39,952 --> 00:52:41,422
Should we all pour them separately?

1537
00:52:42,052 --> 00:52:43,681
- We should.
- Separately?

1538
00:52:43,682 --> 00:52:44,951
Let's be fair.

1539
00:52:44,952 --> 00:52:46,052
- Sure.
- Yes.

1540
00:52:46,752 --> 00:52:48,361
And you have to down it.

1541
00:52:48,362 --> 00:52:49,421
- Okay.
- Let's drink it.

1542
00:52:49,422 --> 00:52:51,591
- Did you already open it?
- Yes. It should be done at once.

1543
00:52:51,592 --> 00:52:53,531
- Pour it.
- Open it instantly.

1544
00:52:53,532 --> 00:52:55,162
- We're pouring it.
- In 1, 2, 3.

1545
00:52:56,332 --> 00:52:58,101
Don't let it bubble up.

1546
00:52:58,102 --> 00:53:00,131
- Okay. Don't make bubbles.
- All right.

1547
00:53:00,132 --> 00:53:01,301
To the end.

1548
00:53:01,302 --> 00:53:02,871
You have the most bubbles.

1549
00:53:02,872 --> 00:53:04,011
I have to wait.

1550
00:53:04,012 --> 00:53:05,012
- Tae Hyun.
- I'm pouring it to the brim.

1551
00:53:05,013 --> 00:53:06,071
- Hold on.
- Be honest.

1552
00:53:06,072 --> 00:53:07,982
- I'll let it die down.
- We'll check them.

1553
00:53:08,382 --> 00:53:09,712
This much.

1554
00:53:10,582 --> 00:53:11,951
- This much?
- Pour some more.

1555
00:53:11,952 --> 00:53:13,312
- You need more.
- Pour some more.

1556
00:53:13,352 --> 00:53:14,451
- Pour more.
- Good.

1557
00:53:14,452 --> 00:53:16,122
- This much?
- Pour some more.

1558
00:53:16,382 --> 00:53:18,121
(Respecting the elders)

1559
00:53:18,122 --> 00:53:19,122
I have more.

1560
00:53:19,123 --> 00:53:20,691
- No, we have the same amount.
- This much?

1561
00:53:20,692 --> 00:53:21,861
- Pour some more?
- Just a little more.

1562
00:53:21,862 --> 00:53:22,961
You need at least this much.

1563
00:53:22,962 --> 00:53:24,031
- This is...
- Okay. Let's start.

1564
00:53:24,032 --> 00:53:25,962
- We have to drink this much?
- Let's do it.

1565
00:53:26,732 --> 00:53:28,031
In 2026,

1566
00:53:28,032 --> 00:53:30,131
- stay healthy.
- Happy and healthy.

1567
00:53:30,132 --> 00:53:31,201
- Good luck this year.
- Happy New Year, guys.

1568
00:53:31,202 --> 00:53:32,571
- Happy New Year!
- Happy New Year!

1569
00:53:32,572 --> 00:53:33,802
In 1, 2, 3.

1570
00:53:43,542 --> 00:53:45,182
(They begin holding their burps.)

1571
00:53:54,992 --> 00:53:55,992
(Peeking)

1572
00:53:58,462 --> 00:54:00,392
(Tapping)

1573
00:54:05,572 --> 00:54:06,672
- Who was it?
- Hey.

1574
00:54:07,272 --> 00:54:08,572
Excuse me.

1575
00:54:09,142 --> 00:54:10,871
But Yeon Seok...

1576
00:54:10,872 --> 00:54:11,911
- How did it happen?
- Hey.

1577
00:54:11,912 --> 00:54:13,192
- Did you do something?
- But...

1578
00:54:13,442 --> 00:54:15,182
- He tapped his chest.
- That...

1579
00:54:15,482 --> 00:54:17,882
It was right here.

1580
00:54:18,482 --> 00:54:20,051
It was right here, and you...

1581
00:54:20,052 --> 00:54:21,482
- Sorry.
- But...

1582
00:54:23,522 --> 00:54:25,751
There was no rule stopping us from touching.

1583
00:54:25,752 --> 00:54:28,422
But you struck the exact area.

1584
00:54:29,062 --> 00:54:31,192
You Year-of-the-Rat-born...

1585
00:54:31,432 --> 00:54:33,832
- Thank you for the food.
- How did you know the exact spot?

1586
00:54:34,332 --> 00:54:35,801
Thanks for the food,

1587
00:54:35,802 --> 00:54:38,031
- Jae Suk.
- Thanks for the food.

1588
00:54:38,032 --> 00:54:39,331
Thanks for the food.

1589
00:54:39,332 --> 00:54:40,971
No, it was all thanks to you.

1590
00:54:40,972 --> 00:54:42,071
- Thank you for the food.
- Good boy.

1591
00:54:42,072 --> 00:54:43,441
- It was a great meal.
- I deserve this much, at least.

1592
00:54:43,442 --> 00:54:44,871
This year is going to be...

1593
00:54:44,872 --> 00:54:46,311
- Yeon Shik, - Yes.

1594
00:54:46,312 --> 00:54:47,441
That's how you should treat me.

1595
00:54:47,442 --> 00:54:49,712
It was a great meal this year.

1596
00:54:50,112 --> 00:54:51,851
- Thank you for the food.
- Thank you.

1597
00:54:51,852 --> 00:54:52,982
(Jae Suk will pay.)

1598
00:54:53,682 --> 00:54:55,181
- Thank you for coming.
- Come again.

1599
00:54:55,182 --> 00:54:56,321
Oh, I forgot my umbrella.

1600
00:54:56,322 --> 00:54:57,622
- Here it is.
- It's here.

1601
00:54:58,352 --> 00:54:59,451
(Touched)

1602
00:54:59,452 --> 00:55:01,062
- Thanks, Yeon Shik.
- Don't mention it.

1603
00:55:01,522 --> 00:55:02,591
- Yeon Shik is...
- You paid for our food.

1604
00:55:02,592 --> 00:55:03,661
It's the least I can do.

1605
00:55:03,662 --> 00:55:04,932
That's right.

1606
00:55:05,032 --> 00:55:06,062
You're right.

1607
00:55:06,492 --> 00:55:07,831
As long as you know that.

1608
00:55:07,832 --> 00:55:08,962
(Current time, 2:36pm)

1609
00:55:09,702 --> 00:55:10,971
The 3412 bus is behind it.

1610
00:55:10,972 --> 00:55:12,971
- There it comes.
- It's coming. Bus number 3412.

1611
00:55:12,972 --> 00:55:14,142
Let's go.

1612
00:55:14,342 --> 00:55:17,242
- Four people.
- Please wait.

1613
00:55:17,442 --> 00:55:18,672
Oh, boy.

1614
00:55:19,212 --> 00:55:22,841
- The seats are really big.
- It's a good bus.

1615
00:55:22,842 --> 00:55:24,182
This is nice.

1616
00:55:24,982 --> 00:55:26,352
- It must be a new bus.
- Right.

1617
00:55:26,612 --> 00:55:28,382
I know, right? It's a new model.

1618
00:55:29,152 --> 00:55:31,892
It's the perfect bus to shoot electricity at.

1619
00:55:32,452 --> 00:55:33,821
(Laughing)

1620
00:55:33,822 --> 00:55:35,622
Everything leads to that show.

1621
00:55:35,722 --> 00:55:37,332
Darn Electronic.

1622
00:55:38,592 --> 00:55:40,068
Do Hoon, do you normally take the bus?

1623
00:55:40,092 --> 00:55:43,331
Yes, and I often take the bus and subway.

1624
00:55:43,332 --> 00:55:44,602
- You like it?
- Yes.

1625
00:55:44,702 --> 00:55:46,032
It's so convenient these days.

1626
00:55:46,202 --> 00:55:49,441
- That's true.
- I guess that's why they don't...

1627
00:55:49,442 --> 00:55:51,111
their driver's license even when they turn 20.

1628
00:55:51,112 --> 00:55:53,211
Back in the day, it was the first thing we wanted.

1629
00:55:53,212 --> 00:55:54,511
We had to get a driver's license.

1630
00:55:54,512 --> 00:55:55,612
I asked Su Chan,

1631
00:55:55,642 --> 00:55:57,181
"Don't you need to get a driver's license?"

1632
00:55:57,182 --> 00:55:58,682
And he answered, "Not really."

1633
00:55:58,712 --> 00:56:00,451
The public transportation is very convenient now.

1634
00:56:00,452 --> 00:56:02,412
- That must be why...
- You can do it on the app.

1635
00:56:02,482 --> 00:56:06,322
They have different mindsets compared to us.

1636
00:56:07,052 --> 00:56:09,522
It might have taken us too long on foot.

1637
00:56:10,262 --> 00:56:12,961
We can get off at this stop.

1638
00:56:12,962 --> 00:56:14,562
- Okay.
- At this stop.

1639
00:56:14,662 --> 00:56:16,631
- Jung Sang Woo.
- Sang Woo.

1640
00:56:16,632 --> 00:56:19,471
"At home, it's a sitcom..."

1641
00:56:19,472 --> 00:56:20,672
"fueled by my son's laughter."

1642
00:56:20,802 --> 00:56:23,271
"At the studio, an obsessive thriller..."

1643
00:56:23,272 --> 00:56:25,271
"where I pull all-nighters for a single scene."

1644
00:56:25,272 --> 00:56:27,981
"On my commute, a high-octane action blockbuster..."

1645
00:56:27,982 --> 00:56:29,862
"racing at the speed of my heart rate, 200bpm."

1646
00:56:30,582 --> 00:56:32,212
"As someone who excessively indulges..."

1647
00:56:32,482 --> 00:56:35,152
"in 0.1-second sounds,"

1648
00:56:35,222 --> 00:56:36,921
"grant me a dopamine climax that will help me forget..."

1649
00:56:36,922 --> 00:56:38,592
"everything else."

1650
00:56:38,822 --> 00:56:41,421
- Sounds?
- Is he in our industry?

1651
00:56:41,422 --> 00:56:42,922
- It sounds like...
- Right?

1652
00:56:43,022 --> 00:56:44,582
- Did he write, "Sound?"
- Or webtoons.

1653
00:56:45,092 --> 00:56:47,362
He excessively indulges in 0.1-second sounds.

1654
00:56:47,732 --> 00:56:49,061
Is this it?

1655
00:56:49,062 --> 00:56:51,172
- I think it's the basement here.
- Wait.

1656
00:56:51,272 --> 00:56:53,932
- It says, "Artist."
- "Artist?"

1657
00:56:54,602 --> 00:56:56,101
- This must be it.
- Are we here?

1658
00:56:56,102 --> 00:56:57,741
(They're unsure as they enter.)

1659
00:56:57,742 --> 00:56:58,812
This is the place.

1660
00:56:59,512 --> 00:57:01,488
- Did I come to the right place?
- Is this his studio?

1661
00:57:01,512 --> 00:57:03,112
A blue door?

1662
00:57:03,312 --> 00:57:04,552
I think this is the one.

1663
00:57:04,982 --> 00:57:06,051
- Oh, my.
- Gosh.

1664
00:57:06,052 --> 00:57:07,311
- Are you Sang Woo?
- Yes.

1665
00:57:07,312 --> 00:57:08,581
- Hello.
- It is him!

1666
00:57:08,582 --> 00:57:09,981
- Hello.
- Hello.

1667
00:57:09,982 --> 00:57:11,051
So, this is it.

1668
00:57:11,052 --> 00:57:13,022
- It was a studio.
- Nice to meet you.

1669
00:57:13,092 --> 00:57:14,661
- It's good to meet you.
- We have to wear slippers, right?

1670
00:57:14,662 --> 00:57:15,791
Yes, here are the slippers.

1671
00:57:15,792 --> 00:57:16,822
Thank you.

1672
00:57:17,192 --> 00:57:18,662
I didn't know there was a studio.

1673
00:57:18,892 --> 00:57:20,932
Here? Look at that.

1674
00:57:21,702 --> 00:57:23,031
- No way!
- This is pretty cool.

1675
00:57:23,032 --> 00:57:24,502
It's my studio.

1676
00:57:25,502 --> 00:57:26,772
Gosh.

1677
00:57:27,232 --> 00:57:30,101
- It's an audio studio.
- Right.

1678
00:57:30,102 --> 00:57:31,611
He's like a sound engineer.

1679
00:57:31,612 --> 00:57:33,412
- A sound studio.
- A sound engineer.

1680
00:57:33,472 --> 00:57:34,842
He must be.

1681
00:57:34,982 --> 00:57:36,682
Do you make background music?

1682
00:57:37,012 --> 00:57:39,381
I'm making music for movies and dramas.

1683
00:57:39,382 --> 00:57:40,511
- I'm a music director.
- A music director.

1684
00:57:40,512 --> 00:57:43,022
- Yes.
- Oh, you're a music director.

1685
00:57:43,622 --> 00:57:44,891
(A music director is someone...)

1686
00:57:44,892 --> 00:57:46,151
(responsible for selecting, composing, and arranging music...)

1687
00:57:46,152 --> 00:57:47,521
(to be used in dramas, movies, and other media.)

1688
00:57:47,522 --> 00:57:51,792
(The music director for "Squid Game," Jung Jae Il)

1689
00:57:52,332 --> 00:57:53,791
(The music director for "A Tale of Two Sisters,")

1690
00:57:53,792 --> 00:57:55,462
(Lee Byeong Woo)

1691
00:57:55,762 --> 00:57:58,172
- Nice to meet you.
- Good to meet you.

1692
00:57:58,972 --> 00:58:00,232
If you're...

1693
00:58:00,532 --> 00:58:02,071
creating music here,

1694
00:58:02,072 --> 00:58:04,412
when do you come and leave?

1695
00:58:04,672 --> 00:58:06,071
- I...
- It depends on the work.

1696
00:58:06,072 --> 00:58:08,581
It depends on whether I have work or not.

1697
00:58:08,582 --> 00:58:10,241
- Right.
- When I do,

1698
00:58:10,242 --> 00:58:12,081
at around 6am.

1699
00:58:12,082 --> 00:58:13,281
That early?

1700
00:58:13,282 --> 00:58:14,981
No, that's when I go home.

1701
00:58:14,982 --> 00:58:16,151
- Oh, you go home.
- I see.

1702
00:58:16,152 --> 00:58:18,221
- They normally pull all-nighters.
- Right.

1703
00:58:18,222 --> 00:58:19,551
- You're right.
- Yes.

1704
00:58:19,552 --> 00:58:22,361
Then, I get home and send my kid to daycare.

1705
00:58:22,362 --> 00:58:24,091
- Okay.
- And then,

1706
00:58:24,092 --> 00:58:26,031
- Then, you go to bed.
- I get a little bit of sleep.

1707
00:58:26,032 --> 00:58:27,431
- Like a nap.
- Yes.

1708
00:58:27,432 --> 00:58:28,731
I sleep for 2 to 3 hours.

1709
00:58:28,732 --> 00:58:30,302
You have a child?

1710
00:58:30,832 --> 00:58:32,472
He's 31 months old.

1711
00:58:32,772 --> 00:58:34,972
That's when they need the most care.

1712
00:58:35,002 --> 00:58:38,111
Do you come back to work after 2 to 3 hours of sleep?

1713
00:58:38,112 --> 00:58:39,971
- Yes, when I'm busy.
- When you're busy.

1714
00:58:39,972 --> 00:58:41,341
- Do you...
- Have you worked...

1715
00:58:41,342 --> 00:58:43,541
on any movies or shows that we were in?

1716
00:58:43,542 --> 00:58:45,151
Not as a music director,

1717
00:58:45,152 --> 00:58:47,311
but I participated as a session musician once.

1718
00:58:47,312 --> 00:58:49,782
- It was "Mood of the Day."
- Really?

1719
00:58:49,882 --> 00:58:51,721
I participated as a session musician.

1720
00:58:51,722 --> 00:58:53,492
I see.

1721
00:58:53,552 --> 00:58:55,361
What was your first work as a music director?

1722
00:58:55,362 --> 00:58:56,621
- Your debut work.
- The first work...

1723
00:58:56,622 --> 00:58:59,891
I participated as a music director was...

1724
00:58:59,892 --> 00:59:02,761
officially "The Outlaws 2."

1725
00:59:02,762 --> 00:59:06,002
("The Outlaws 2")

1726
00:59:06,072 --> 00:59:08,902
Before that, I worked on "Extreme Job" as a music director.

1727
00:59:09,172 --> 00:59:11,842
- You worked on a lot of good ones.
- Really?

1728
00:59:12,512 --> 00:59:14,511
You must have worked on other movies,

1729
00:59:14,512 --> 00:59:16,141
- The big ones.
- but you worked on big ones.

1730
00:59:16,142 --> 00:59:17,181
They both had over ten million viewers.

1731
00:59:17,182 --> 00:59:18,512
Over ten million viewers.

1732
00:59:19,452 --> 00:59:20,921
I got lucky.

1733
00:59:20,922 --> 00:59:22,382
What were the bad ones?

1734
00:59:23,982 --> 00:59:25,451
Come on, man.

1735
00:59:25,452 --> 00:59:27,322
He's only telling us the good ones.

1736
00:59:27,492 --> 00:59:28,621
(Flustered by the classy question)

1737
00:59:28,622 --> 00:59:29,891
- He's not telling us anything else.
- If he said...

1738
00:59:29,892 --> 00:59:32,061
a movie you were in that didn't do so well,

1739
00:59:32,062 --> 00:59:34,631
- I know!
- it would have been great.

1740
00:59:34,632 --> 00:59:35,902
That's too bad.

1741
00:59:36,402 --> 00:59:38,131
When you work...

1742
00:59:38,132 --> 00:59:40,071
- as a music director, - Yes.

1743
00:59:40,072 --> 00:59:41,701
- you also receive music royalties.
- Right.

1744
00:59:41,702 --> 00:59:42,941
I do.

1745
00:59:42,942 --> 00:59:44,518
Is there a movie that constantly pays you?

1746
00:59:44,542 --> 00:59:47,472
The most constant one is...

1747
00:59:47,512 --> 00:59:50,842
also my favorite, and it's called "Be Melodramatic."

1748
00:59:51,252 --> 00:59:54,182
- Oh, right.
- That song is often played...

1749
00:59:54,622 --> 00:59:57,751
on "The Return of Superman" and "You Quiz on the Block."

1750
00:59:57,752 --> 00:59:58,851
As background music?

1751
00:59:58,852 --> 01:00:01,362
I get paid quite a lot because of that.

1752
01:00:02,062 --> 01:00:03,691
Because they use my song so often.

1753
01:00:03,692 --> 01:00:05,461
They play it a lot on other variety shows.

1754
01:00:05,462 --> 01:00:06,861
Yes, on variety shows,

1755
01:00:06,862 --> 01:00:09,701
they tend to use instrumental songs.

1756
01:00:09,702 --> 01:00:10,731
- That's nice.
- Nice.

1757
01:00:10,732 --> 01:00:12,802
- I realize that you have...
- Yes.

1758
01:00:12,832 --> 01:00:14,071
A lot of instruments.

1759
01:00:14,072 --> 01:00:15,471
You have so many guitars.

1760
01:00:15,472 --> 01:00:17,071
I used to be a guitarist.

1761
01:00:17,072 --> 01:00:18,712
I see.

1762
01:00:18,772 --> 01:00:20,141
You must have been in a band, then.

1763
01:00:20,142 --> 01:00:21,911
Yes, ever since I was little.

1764
01:00:21,912 --> 01:00:22,912
What was the band?

1765
01:00:22,913 --> 01:00:24,211
It wasn't famous at all.

1766
01:00:24,212 --> 01:00:27,012
- It's called From The Airport.
- I see.

1767
01:00:28,652 --> 01:00:31,051
(From The Airport is a 2-man electronica band.)

1768
01:00:31,052 --> 01:00:32,922
(Our Whenever Guest at the time)

1769
01:00:34,192 --> 01:00:35,861
- For about 10 or 12 years.
- "From the airport."

1770
01:00:35,862 --> 01:00:36,892
Yes.

1771
01:00:37,022 --> 01:00:38,862
It's literally "from the airport."

1772
01:00:39,132 --> 01:00:40,961
- From The Airport.
- You're right.

1773
01:00:40,962 --> 01:00:42,602
That's what it means.

1774
01:00:42,702 --> 01:00:45,001
What made you apply for the show?

1775
01:00:45,002 --> 01:00:47,102
I recently worked...

1776
01:00:47,172 --> 01:00:50,671
on a movie called "The First Ride," and...

1777
01:00:50,672 --> 01:00:52,011
Isn't that the one Kang Ha Neul is in?

1778
01:00:52,012 --> 01:00:53,911
- Yes. Ha Neul.
- I see.

1779
01:00:53,912 --> 01:00:55,482
Making music for that movie was...

1780
01:00:55,542 --> 01:00:57,441
pretty rough.

1781
01:00:57,442 --> 01:01:00,651
I could only get two hours of sleep a day...

1782
01:01:00,652 --> 01:01:02,822
for a month,

1783
01:01:02,982 --> 01:01:05,652
and I didn't even realize that I had applied.

1784
01:01:05,892 --> 01:01:07,521
But it turns out that I did. I did it in my sleep.

1785
01:01:07,522 --> 01:01:08,522
- In your sleep?
- Yes.

1786
01:01:08,523 --> 01:01:09,891
- You weren't in your right mind.
- No.

1787
01:01:09,892 --> 01:01:12,091
- But how...
- I don't even drink, and...

1788
01:01:12,092 --> 01:01:13,861
You must have been startled when you got the call.

1789
01:01:13,862 --> 01:01:15,201
I was so startled.

1790
01:01:15,202 --> 01:01:18,532
When I first got the call, I was like, "Which show?"

1791
01:01:18,732 --> 01:01:21,501
They read what I wrote, and it reminded me.

1792
01:01:21,502 --> 01:01:25,172
I remember writing something like a beam of hope.

1793
01:01:25,412 --> 01:01:27,842
You had forgotten that you even applied for it.

1794
01:01:28,182 --> 01:01:29,841
And we're here.

1795
01:01:29,842 --> 01:01:31,351
- I'm sorry.
- No, we're sorry.

1796
01:01:31,352 --> 01:01:32,582
Oh, no.

1797
01:01:33,212 --> 01:01:35,722
We should have forgotten each other.

1798
01:01:36,022 --> 01:01:37,922
Our crew just had to...

1799
01:01:37,992 --> 01:01:39,221
dig that up.

1800
01:01:39,222 --> 01:01:40,821
- No, I'm glad you're here.
- It depends...

1801
01:01:40,822 --> 01:01:42,461
- on how today's game goes.
- Right.

1802
01:01:42,462 --> 01:01:44,061
- If he wins a prize, - Right.

1803
01:01:44,062 --> 01:01:45,461
- it will be great.
- It's your lucky day.

1804
01:01:45,462 --> 01:01:47,661
- We're on a roll.
- We gave our previous guest...

1805
01:01:47,662 --> 01:01:49,862
the prize for Round Three.

1806
01:01:50,332 --> 01:01:52,231
We have great teamwork today.

1807
01:01:52,232 --> 01:01:53,771
- Tae Bal, - Okay.

1808
01:01:53,772 --> 01:01:54,872
Throw it.

1809
01:01:55,102 --> 01:01:56,142
Here I go.

1810
01:02:01,842 --> 01:02:02,882
It dropped.

1811
01:02:03,542 --> 01:02:05,251
- Wait. This isn't...
- Oh, boy.

1812
01:02:05,252 --> 01:02:07,282
- It should be on the table.
- It...

1813
01:02:07,482 --> 01:02:08,621
- It's zero.
- But...

1814
01:02:08,622 --> 01:02:09,782
- But it's...
- Zero.

1815
01:02:09,922 --> 01:02:12,492
And you tapped it in the end.

1816
01:02:12,822 --> 01:02:14,251
I didn't. It came and hit me.

1817
01:02:14,252 --> 01:02:16,161
You should have taken your foot out...

1818
01:02:16,162 --> 01:02:17,461
when it was near it.

1819
01:02:17,462 --> 01:02:18,892
Just be done with it and go home.

1820
01:02:20,532 --> 01:02:23,161
Let's try Round One. Yeon Shik will show you the prize.

1821
01:02:23,162 --> 01:02:24,702
Here's the prize.

1822
01:02:26,132 --> 01:02:27,902
It could be unexpected.

1823
01:02:28,272 --> 01:02:30,441
- Is it related to babies?
- It could be.

1824
01:02:30,442 --> 01:02:32,371
"A drink for myself..."

1825
01:02:32,372 --> 01:02:34,141
"after a long day of babysitting and pulling an all-nighter."

1826
01:02:34,142 --> 01:02:35,241
"A Johnnie Walker Blue Label."

1827
01:02:35,242 --> 01:02:36,342
It's liquor.

1828
01:02:36,542 --> 01:02:39,211
(High-end liquor, a drink for myself after a long day)

1829
01:02:39,212 --> 01:02:40,551
But you have so much liquor.

1830
01:02:40,552 --> 01:02:42,051
It's not exactly for myself.

1831
01:02:42,052 --> 01:02:43,221
- When I have guests over...
- It's for your guests.

1832
01:02:43,222 --> 01:02:45,321
When I have directors or CEOs over...

1833
01:02:45,322 --> 01:02:47,322
You can add it to your collection.

1834
01:02:47,592 --> 01:02:49,061
(The mission for a bottle of whiskey)

1835
01:02:49,062 --> 01:02:51,632
(Hands Up! OST Quiz)

1836
01:02:51,662 --> 01:02:53,391
(Round 1)

1837
01:02:53,392 --> 01:02:55,101
(Listen to an original soundtrack for 10 seconds, )

1838
01:02:55,102 --> 01:02:57,231
(and guess which movie or show it's from.)

1839
01:02:57,232 --> 01:02:59,701
(They succeed if all 4 of them guess correctly.)

1840
01:02:59,702 --> 01:03:01,342
All four of us?

1841
01:03:01,502 --> 01:03:02,802
It's the toughest one.

1842
01:03:02,972 --> 01:03:04,671
- We're guessing the song.
- That's...

1843
01:03:04,672 --> 01:03:06,541
- We're terrible at this.
- We're so bad at this.

1844
01:03:06,542 --> 01:03:07,812
We're bad at this.

1845
01:03:07,842 --> 01:03:09,041
If that's the game...

1846
01:03:09,042 --> 01:03:11,782
This one is so tricky.

1847
01:03:12,212 --> 01:03:13,681
- You get four songs.
- And we have to guess...

1848
01:03:13,682 --> 01:03:14,781
- all four of them?
- Yes.

1849
01:03:14,782 --> 01:03:16,022
We've...

1850
01:03:16,182 --> 01:03:18,551
never succeeded in these quizzes.

1851
01:03:18,552 --> 01:03:21,392
Back then, was it special effects?

1852
01:03:21,422 --> 01:03:22,422
Yes.

1853
01:03:22,462 --> 01:03:23,521
Kim Jung Eun?

1854
01:03:23,522 --> 01:03:25,861
(Not only Jae Suk...)

1855
01:03:25,862 --> 01:03:28,101
(and Yeon Seok, )

1856
01:03:28,102 --> 01:03:30,262
(but also Tae Hyun struggled with quizzes.)

1857
01:03:30,332 --> 01:03:31,702
It's such a tricky one.

1858
01:03:32,002 --> 01:03:34,202
The director should've joined.

1859
01:03:34,402 --> 01:03:35,741
You're right. We don't have a bonus chance.

1860
01:03:35,742 --> 01:03:36,841
(They don't even have a music director chance.)

1861
01:03:36,842 --> 01:03:38,312
Regardless of the sitting order,

1862
01:03:38,442 --> 01:03:40,741
say, "Let me answer." If you are correct, you can escape.

1863
01:03:40,742 --> 01:03:41,781
Okay.

1864
01:03:41,782 --> 01:03:44,482
- You need to go last.
- In that case, we'll do...

1865
01:03:44,782 --> 01:03:46,552
- the easy ones.
- Okay.

1866
01:03:46,912 --> 01:03:47,981
Let's do this.

1867
01:03:47,982 --> 01:03:49,081
Let's do a cheer.

1868
01:03:49,082 --> 01:03:51,252
- In 1, 2, 3. Let's go!
- In 1, 2, 3. Let's go!

1869
01:03:51,692 --> 01:03:53,121
- Here comes the 1st try.
- The 1st try.

1870
01:03:53,122 --> 01:03:54,252
We can't even practice.

1871
01:03:54,392 --> 01:03:56,068
You'll get ten seconds of the music. Ready.

1872
01:03:56,092 --> 01:03:57,192
We're in trouble.

1873
01:03:59,062 --> 01:04:01,092
Music, cue.

1874
01:04:01,802 --> 01:04:03,832
(1st question, try number 1)

1875
01:04:04,672 --> 01:04:05,732
Let me answer.

1876
01:04:06,232 --> 01:04:07,501
- We got the title.
- It gave us the title.

1877
01:04:07,502 --> 01:04:09,671
- It gave us the title.
- But...

1878
01:04:09,672 --> 01:04:12,148
- We need to guess which one.
- We must guess which "High Kick."

1879
01:04:12,172 --> 01:04:13,211
"High Kick Through the Roof."

1880
01:04:13,212 --> 01:04:15,241
("High Kick!" versus "High Kick Through the Roof")

1881
01:04:15,242 --> 01:04:16,312
Incorrect.

1882
01:04:17,112 --> 01:04:18,881
- Is it the other one?
- It's "High Kick!"

1883
01:04:18,882 --> 01:04:19,882
(The answer is "High Kick!")

1884
01:04:19,883 --> 01:04:21,481
Why did you answer so quickly...

1885
01:04:21,482 --> 01:04:23,162
- from the start?
- It's from "High Kick!"

1886
01:04:23,452 --> 01:04:24,621
- Jae Suk.
- He's really bad at this.

1887
01:04:24,622 --> 01:04:26,092
You got it wrong so quickly.

1888
01:04:26,222 --> 01:04:27,861
Is there a drama titled "High Kick Through the Roof?"

1889
01:04:27,862 --> 01:04:31,021
Yes, there is. Is the second one "High Kick Through the Roof?"

1890
01:04:31,022 --> 01:04:32,192
Yes, it's the second one.

1891
01:04:33,132 --> 01:04:34,268
- Seriously.
- Did we fail already?

1892
01:04:34,292 --> 01:04:36,292
- The first try failed.
- I answered accidentally.

1893
01:04:36,802 --> 01:04:38,671
- It was an accident.
- I answered accidentally.

1894
01:04:38,672 --> 01:04:40,132
You answered too quickly.

1895
01:04:40,802 --> 01:04:42,402
- The first try...
- Do Hoon, come here.

1896
01:04:42,472 --> 01:04:43,901
- Me?
- The sitting order doesn't matter.

1897
01:04:43,902 --> 01:04:45,372
When I'm in the middle,

1898
01:04:45,742 --> 01:04:47,772
I answer without thinking.

1899
01:04:48,442 --> 01:04:51,142
- You feel responsible.
- I feel the need to do something.

1900
01:04:51,312 --> 01:04:52,352
I'm sorry.

1901
01:04:52,612 --> 01:04:54,211
- Let's go. We did this earlier.
- We have many tries left.

1902
01:04:54,212 --> 01:04:55,381
- That's right.
- Let's do a cheer.

1903
01:04:55,382 --> 01:04:56,851
- Okay.
- In 1, 2, 3.

1904
01:04:56,852 --> 01:04:57,922
- Let's go!
- Let's go!

1905
01:04:58,052 --> 01:04:59,791
I won't answer without thinking.

1906
01:04:59,792 --> 01:05:02,922
This is the second one. Music, cue.

1907
01:05:03,492 --> 01:05:05,191
(1st question, try number 2)

1908
01:05:05,192 --> 01:05:06,491
You know this one.

1909
01:05:06,492 --> 01:05:07,492
This one!

1910
01:05:07,732 --> 01:05:09,201
(The three of them have an idea.)

1911
01:05:09,202 --> 01:05:10,878
- Who wants to answer?
- Hurry up and do it.

1912
01:05:10,902 --> 01:05:11,932
Do it.

1913
01:05:12,672 --> 01:05:14,002
- Go ahead.
- "Veteran."

1914
01:05:14,132 --> 01:05:15,242
Correct.

1915
01:05:16,402 --> 01:05:17,571
(Do Hoon is correct!)

1916
01:05:17,572 --> 01:05:19,212
- I didn't know.
- I almost got it wrong.

1917
01:05:19,442 --> 01:05:20,471
Same here.

1918
01:05:20,472 --> 01:05:22,011
- I thought it was...
- "Nameless Gangster."

1919
01:05:22,012 --> 01:05:24,382
- Same here.
- Director Yoon Jong Bin's work.

1920
01:05:25,652 --> 01:05:26,751
- It's "Veteran."
- I also thought it was that one.

1921
01:05:26,752 --> 01:05:28,798
- It's "Veteran."
- That original soundtrack goes...

1922
01:05:28,822 --> 01:05:30,381
(Singing)

1923
01:05:30,382 --> 01:05:31,982
- "Nameless Gangster?"
- I got confused.

1924
01:05:32,192 --> 01:05:34,091
"Let's get started!"

1925
01:05:34,092 --> 01:05:36,252
- That's it. I got confused.
- It's a different movie.

1926
01:05:36,462 --> 01:05:38,262
- Well done, Do Hoon.
- My goodness.

1927
01:05:38,362 --> 01:05:39,662
- Well done.
- Okay.

1928
01:05:39,892 --> 01:05:41,631
The three of us are on the same level.

1929
01:05:41,632 --> 01:05:42,901
- Well done.
- Seriously.

1930
01:05:42,902 --> 01:05:44,832
The three of us are the same.

1931
01:05:44,932 --> 01:05:47,031
- But this is...
- We thought of the same answer.

1932
01:05:47,032 --> 01:05:48,541
We still have a chance.

1933
01:05:48,542 --> 01:05:49,871
- Do Hoon succeeded in it.
- Okay.

1934
01:05:49,872 --> 01:05:51,101
- Music, - Let's do well.

1935
01:05:51,102 --> 01:05:52,172
Cue.

1936
01:05:52,572 --> 01:05:55,211
(2nd question, try number 2)

1937
01:05:55,212 --> 01:05:56,312
Hold on. This is...

1938
01:05:56,942 --> 01:05:58,052
You know what it is, right?

1939
01:05:58,182 --> 01:05:59,182
Don't give a hint.

1940
01:06:00,052 --> 01:06:01,211
- Go.
- Yeon Seok.

1941
01:06:01,212 --> 01:06:02,281
- Go ahead.
- You know what it is.

1942
01:06:02,282 --> 01:06:03,381
(Yeon Seok gives it a go.)

1943
01:06:03,382 --> 01:06:04,991
- "Stairway to Heaven?"
- Incorrect.

1944
01:06:04,992 --> 01:06:06,721
- It's...
- What is it? I don't know.

1945
01:06:06,722 --> 01:06:07,822
"Autumn in My Heart."

1946
01:06:08,162 --> 01:06:10,522
It's too old.

1947
01:06:10,792 --> 01:06:11,832
How could you...

1948
01:06:11,992 --> 01:06:13,738
- Jae Suk, did you know?
- Of course, I knew.

1949
01:06:13,762 --> 01:06:15,631
- "Stairway to Heaven."
- Then you should've answered.

1950
01:06:15,632 --> 01:06:17,161
He said that he knew the answer.

1951
01:06:17,162 --> 01:06:18,802
(The game of wits failed.)

1952
01:06:19,772 --> 01:06:20,872
All right.

1953
01:06:21,002 --> 01:06:22,471
I don't know any original soundtracks.

1954
01:06:22,472 --> 01:06:24,672
- The one who is certain...
- Yes. He should answer.

1955
01:06:25,072 --> 01:06:26,171
Let's do a cheer.

1956
01:06:26,172 --> 01:06:27,741
- In 1, 2, 3.
- Here we go!

1957
01:06:27,742 --> 01:06:29,211
- We got this.
- This is the third try.

1958
01:06:29,212 --> 01:06:30,418
(Out of 10 total tries, they're on try number 3.)

1959
01:06:30,442 --> 01:06:31,882
- Music, - Do Hoon needs to go last.

1960
01:06:32,912 --> 01:06:34,051
Cue.

1961
01:06:34,052 --> 01:06:36,181
(1st question, try number 3)

1962
01:06:36,182 --> 01:06:37,628
- What? This is...
- We know the answer.

1963
01:06:37,652 --> 01:06:39,021
It's an easy one. So go first.

1964
01:06:39,022 --> 01:06:40,452
- I mean...
- Go ahead.

1965
01:06:41,092 --> 01:06:42,822
- This is...
- You know this one.

1966
01:06:43,492 --> 01:06:45,892
We know the answer. It's an easy one. So go first.

1967
01:06:46,492 --> 01:06:47,762
- This is...
- I know this one.

1968
01:06:48,132 --> 01:06:49,732
- Say, "Let me answer."
- Let me answer.

1969
01:06:49,962 --> 01:06:51,031
- "The Lion King."
- Correct.

1970
01:06:51,032 --> 01:06:53,001
- There you go.
- This is good.

1971
01:06:53,002 --> 01:06:54,032
- Okay.
- This is good.

1972
01:06:54,872 --> 01:06:56,941
We knew that one for sure.

1973
01:06:56,942 --> 01:06:58,182
Here comes the second question.

1974
01:06:58,312 --> 01:06:59,912
It's best for me to move out of the way.

1975
01:06:59,942 --> 01:07:02,042
- That's right.
- Music, cue.

1976
01:07:03,112 --> 01:07:05,851
(2nd question, try number 3)

1977
01:07:05,852 --> 01:07:08,021
- Hold on.
- I am okay

1978
01:07:08,022 --> 01:07:09,062
(It's a very famous song.)

1979
01:07:09,322 --> 01:07:11,021
- Hold on. The title...
- I know.

1980
01:07:11,022 --> 01:07:12,191
(What was the title?)

1981
01:07:12,192 --> 01:07:13,252
- The title...
- I know.

1982
01:07:14,322 --> 01:07:15,322
Yeon Seok.

1983
01:07:16,162 --> 01:07:17,822
- "Radio Star."
- We're set.

1984
01:07:17,962 --> 01:07:19,731
I almost said, "Rain and You."

1985
01:07:19,732 --> 01:07:20,761
"Rain and You."

1986
01:07:20,762 --> 01:07:23,102
It's the title of the song.

1987
01:07:23,332 --> 01:07:24,848
- It's the title of the song.
- Exactly.

1988
01:07:24,872 --> 01:07:26,502
I couldn't think of "Radio Star."

1989
01:07:26,672 --> 01:07:28,442
It's the title of the song.

1990
01:07:28,572 --> 01:07:30,772
- Seriously.
- I need to get it right this time.

1991
01:07:30,972 --> 01:07:33,072
- Do Hoon, did you know this one?
- Yes.

1992
01:07:33,172 --> 01:07:35,742
For your information, I was born in 1998.

1993
01:07:36,142 --> 01:07:37,382
If it's too old...

1994
01:07:37,482 --> 01:07:39,051
Jae Suk, that might happen.

1995
01:07:39,052 --> 01:07:41,212
- If you know, answer.
- Okay. I'll answer if I can.

1996
01:07:41,552 --> 01:07:42,851
The one who is certain should answer.

1997
01:07:42,852 --> 01:07:45,452
Here comes the third one. Two people remain. Music,

1998
01:07:46,192 --> 01:07:47,251
cue.

1999
01:07:47,252 --> 01:07:48,991
(3rd question, try number 3)

2000
01:07:48,992 --> 01:07:50,722
- You know this one.
- I need to do well.

2001
01:07:50,862 --> 01:07:51,862
- Let me answer.
- Okay.

2002
01:07:51,863 --> 01:07:53,031
- "Titanic."
- Correct.

2003
01:07:53,032 --> 01:07:54,191
- Yes.
- "Titanic."

2004
01:07:54,192 --> 01:07:55,562
- Correct.
- Yes.

2005
01:07:56,602 --> 01:07:57,732
Do Hoon.

2006
01:07:58,272 --> 01:07:59,571
Let's do this.

2007
01:07:59,572 --> 01:08:01,442
I was so nervous.

2008
01:08:01,842 --> 01:08:03,302
- I'm so sorry, but...
- All right.

2009
01:08:03,572 --> 01:08:05,912
Do Hoon, this is good.

2010
01:08:06,212 --> 01:08:07,912
- Do Hoon, you're next.
- Okay.

2011
01:08:08,042 --> 01:08:09,842
- Do Hoon will get it right.
- It's so...

2012
01:08:10,182 --> 01:08:12,312
- Do Hoon will get it right.
- It's so...

2013
01:08:13,782 --> 01:08:16,221
(Will they succeed in Round 1?)

2014
01:08:16,222 --> 01:08:17,382
Music,

2015
01:08:18,852 --> 01:08:19,892
cue.

2016
01:08:20,452 --> 01:08:26,032
(4th question, try number 3)

2017
01:08:31,872 --> 01:08:33,172
"Mamma Mia!"

2018
01:08:33,202 --> 01:08:34,942
- Incorrect.
- It's "200 Pounds Beauty."

2019
01:08:35,142 --> 01:08:36,501
- "Mamma Mia!"
- Incorrect.

2020
01:08:36,502 --> 01:08:37,642
It's "200 Pounds Beauty."

2021
01:08:39,572 --> 01:08:40,642
It's "200 Pounds Beauty."

2022
01:08:41,742 --> 01:08:43,281
- I mean...
- It's "200 Pounds Beauty."

2023
01:08:43,282 --> 01:08:44,611
- Do Hoon.
- "Mamma Mia!"

2024
01:08:44,612 --> 01:08:45,711
"Mamma Mia!"

2025
01:08:45,712 --> 01:08:47,481
- "Mamma Mia!"
- Do Hoon.

2026
01:08:47,482 --> 01:08:48,752
- Do Hoon.
- Oh, no.

2027
01:08:49,152 --> 01:08:50,452
- Oh, no.
- That was...

2028
01:08:51,452 --> 01:08:53,821
Seriously, that was the worst mistake.

2029
01:08:53,822 --> 01:08:54,891
- Do Hoon.
- I mean...

2030
01:08:54,892 --> 01:08:56,022
- I'm sorry.
- Do Hoon.

2031
01:08:56,322 --> 01:08:58,091
That was unbelievable.

2032
01:08:58,092 --> 01:08:59,591
(His incorrect answer was shocking.)

2033
01:08:59,592 --> 01:09:01,352
- He suddenly went, "Mamma Mia!"
- I mean...

2034
01:09:01,662 --> 01:09:04,531
You thought of the lyrics, "Maria."

2035
01:09:04,532 --> 01:09:06,371
- From "Ave Maria,"
- "Ave Maria."

2036
01:09:06,372 --> 01:09:07,831
I got "Mamma Mia!"

2037
01:09:07,832 --> 01:09:08,971
(Input: "Ave Maria" Output: "Mamma Mia!")

2038
01:09:08,972 --> 01:09:10,342
How did this happen? No way.

2039
01:09:11,742 --> 01:09:12,871
I'm so sorry.

2040
01:09:12,872 --> 01:09:14,671
- I'm so sorry.
- It's okay.

2041
01:09:14,672 --> 01:09:17,642
- These questions put people...
- I must be insane.

2042
01:09:18,552 --> 01:09:20,381
- in a state of confusion.
- The thing is,

2043
01:09:20,382 --> 01:09:22,098
- I never get them wrong at home.
- I know.

2044
01:09:22,122 --> 01:09:23,551
- When I do this at home...
- Right.

2045
01:09:23,552 --> 01:09:26,422
- I never get them wrong.
- "Look at those fools!"

2046
01:09:26,852 --> 01:09:27,992
I say that.

2047
01:09:28,092 --> 01:09:29,562
- Seriously.
- That's how it is.

2048
01:09:30,562 --> 01:09:32,738
- Where did "Mamma Mia!" come...
- You become confused.

2049
01:09:32,762 --> 01:09:35,232
"Mamma Mia!" came out of nowhere.

2050
01:09:36,232 --> 01:09:37,632
I... I know.

2051
01:09:37,962 --> 01:09:39,101
All right. Let's do a cheer.

2052
01:09:39,102 --> 01:09:41,072
- Do Hoon, forget about it.
- It's okay.

2053
01:09:41,202 --> 01:09:43,541
- I'll be traumatized for life.
- In 1, 2, 3.

2054
01:09:43,542 --> 01:09:44,772
- Let's go!
- Let's go!

2055
01:09:44,942 --> 01:09:46,542
- In 1, 2, 3. Here we go!
- Here we go!

2056
01:09:46,772 --> 01:09:49,441
Let's keep our spirits high. We succeeded in try number 5 or 6...

2057
01:09:49,442 --> 01:09:50,542
- earlier.
- That's right.

2058
01:09:50,742 --> 01:09:53,212
Music, cue.

2059
01:09:54,252 --> 01:09:57,951
(1st question, try number 5)

2060
01:09:57,952 --> 01:09:58,992
What's this?

2061
01:09:59,452 --> 01:10:00,522
(Raising his hand)

2062
01:10:00,892 --> 01:10:04,122
(Do Hoon knows!)

2063
01:10:04,692 --> 01:10:06,962
Let me think this through and check my answer.

2064
01:10:07,092 --> 01:10:08,238
- There you go.
- I'll say my answer.

2065
01:10:08,262 --> 01:10:09,361
- "Cruel Temptation."
- Correct.

2066
01:10:09,362 --> 01:10:10,432
- There you go.
- Yes!

2067
01:10:11,102 --> 01:10:12,131
I couldn't remember the title.

2068
01:10:12,132 --> 01:10:13,202
- There you go.
- Yes!

2069
01:10:13,632 --> 01:10:15,232
- I couldn't remember the title.
- Good.

2070
01:10:15,642 --> 01:10:17,672
- I couldn't remember the title.
- There you go.

2071
01:10:18,042 --> 01:10:19,112
There you go.

2072
01:10:19,842 --> 01:10:21,111
I could only remember the mole.

2073
01:10:21,112 --> 01:10:22,212
I didn't know this one.

2074
01:10:23,482 --> 01:10:24,882
I keep questioning myself.

2075
01:10:26,112 --> 01:10:27,581
How did you get it right?

2076
01:10:27,582 --> 01:10:28,822
(The ace is back.)

2077
01:10:29,982 --> 01:10:31,221
The second music,

2078
01:10:31,222 --> 01:10:33,121
(The nervous trio remains.)

2079
01:10:33,122 --> 01:10:34,352
- cue.
- I'll relax.

2080
01:10:34,692 --> 01:10:35,821
(2nd question, try number 5)

2081
01:10:35,822 --> 01:10:38,291
- All right.
- How... That's the title.

2082
01:10:38,292 --> 01:10:39,331
(2nd question, try number 5)

2083
01:10:39,332 --> 01:10:40,531
That's the song title.

2084
01:10:40,532 --> 01:10:41,892
Hold on. I shouldn't get confused.

2085
01:10:42,432 --> 01:10:44,432
- Do you know the answer?
- Princess.

2086
01:10:45,032 --> 01:10:46,102
- Yeon Seok.
- Okay.

2087
01:10:46,272 --> 01:10:47,531
- "The Little Mermaid."
- Correct.

2088
01:10:47,532 --> 01:10:49,042
- Yes. That's right.
- That's right.

2089
01:10:49,202 --> 01:10:50,441
- "The Little Mermaid."
- Correct.

2090
01:10:50,442 --> 01:10:51,811
- Yes. That's right.
- That's right.

2091
01:10:51,812 --> 01:10:52,912
That's right.

2092
01:10:53,712 --> 01:10:55,381
- Hey.
- The title isn't "Under the Sea."

2093
01:10:55,382 --> 01:10:57,342
- Just now...
- He almost said, "Under the Sea."

2094
01:10:57,582 --> 01:10:59,982
- You almost said, "Under the Sea."
- That's the song title.

2095
01:11:00,112 --> 01:11:02,282
- Yeon Shik, good.
- I knew this one.

2096
01:11:02,452 --> 01:11:03,522
I knew this one.

2097
01:11:03,622 --> 01:11:05,591
- We got this.
- We got this.

2098
01:11:05,592 --> 01:11:06,691
You and I remain.

2099
01:11:06,692 --> 01:11:08,461
All right. The two of us remain.

2100
01:11:08,462 --> 01:11:10,261
(Two big obstacles remain.)

2101
01:11:10,262 --> 01:11:12,361
- Let's relax.
- Tae Hyun and Jae Suk remain.

2102
01:11:12,362 --> 01:11:13,561
- Okay.
- I'll think...

2103
01:11:13,562 --> 01:11:14,878
that I'm watching Whenever Possible at home.

2104
01:11:14,902 --> 01:11:15,962
Music,

2105
01:11:17,362 --> 01:11:18,601
- cue.
- All right.

2106
01:11:18,602 --> 01:11:20,002
(The viewer mode is on.)

2107
01:11:24,942 --> 01:11:26,741
(3rd question, try number 5)

2108
01:11:26,742 --> 01:11:28,942
(It's a song they've heard many times.)

2109
01:11:30,112 --> 01:11:31,312
Let me answer.

2110
01:11:31,812 --> 01:11:33,211
- I'll say it.
- Okay.

2111
01:11:33,212 --> 01:11:34,282
(Viewer Cha will answer!)

2112
01:11:34,682 --> 01:11:36,198
- "Comrades: Almost a Love Story."
- Correct.

2113
01:11:36,222 --> 01:11:37,382
- Good.
- Gosh, that one...

2114
01:11:38,252 --> 01:11:39,651
- It went as I had planned.
- That one wasn't easy.

2115
01:11:39,652 --> 01:11:41,051
- It went as I had planned.
- That one wasn't easy.

2116
01:11:41,052 --> 01:11:42,412
- It went as I had planned.
- Yes.

2117
01:11:42,522 --> 01:11:43,961
- That one wasn't easy.
- Didn't you know?

2118
01:11:43,962 --> 01:11:45,231
- I knew.
- Okay.

2119
01:11:45,232 --> 01:11:46,232
But I couldn't think of the title quickly.

2120
01:11:46,233 --> 01:11:47,261
I thought it was...

2121
01:11:47,262 --> 01:11:48,301
- "In the Mood for Love."
- It's understandable.

2122
01:11:48,302 --> 01:11:49,402
- It's confusing.
- Yes.

2123
01:11:49,562 --> 01:11:51,332
- In any case...
- "In the Mood for Love."

2124
01:11:52,572 --> 01:11:54,872
- This is perfect.
- I need to do this.

2125
01:11:55,272 --> 01:11:56,541
- All right.
- Relax.

2126
01:11:56,542 --> 01:11:57,642
Let's go.

2127
01:11:57,727 --> 01:12:00,037
All right. Let's go.

2128
01:12:00,397 --> 01:12:01,537
- Just say it.
- All right.

2129
01:12:01,937 --> 01:12:03,067
The last music.

2130
01:12:06,837 --> 01:12:08,176
(4th question, try number 5)

2131
01:12:08,177 --> 01:12:09,706
- My goodness.
- You know this one.

2132
01:12:09,707 --> 01:12:10,976
- We're set.
- Yes.

2133
01:12:10,977 --> 01:12:12,776
(4th question, try number 5)

2134
01:12:12,777 --> 01:12:13,846
You know this one.

2135
01:12:13,847 --> 01:12:17,187
(You know this one, right?)

2136
01:12:17,847 --> 01:12:18,847
My goodness.

2137
01:12:18,848 --> 01:12:19,916
- You know this one.
- We're set.

2138
01:12:19,917 --> 01:12:20,986
Yes.

2139
01:12:20,987 --> 01:12:22,156
- "The Godfather."
- Correct.

2140
01:12:22,157 --> 01:12:23,727
("The Godfather")

2141
01:12:23,957 --> 01:12:27,527
(Correct!)

2142
01:12:29,097 --> 01:12:30,997
- I thought it was "Boss."
- I know.

2143
01:12:31,097 --> 01:12:34,166
- Why did I think that?
- It's nerve-racking.

2144
01:12:34,167 --> 01:12:36,606
- I must be insane.
- We succeeded in Round One.

2145
01:12:36,607 --> 01:12:39,406
(They succeeded in Round 1!)

2146
01:12:39,407 --> 01:12:41,506
- We did well as a team.
- Yes.

2147
01:12:41,507 --> 01:12:42,946
Thank goodness the seniors went last.

2148
01:12:42,947 --> 01:12:44,146
- Thank goodness we went last.
- Yes.

2149
01:12:44,147 --> 01:12:45,877
- Thank goodness we went last.
- I know.

2150
01:12:46,047 --> 01:12:47,047
Seriously.

2151
01:12:47,047 --> 01:12:48,047
Thank goodness you went last.

2152
01:12:48,048 --> 01:12:49,746
- All right. Now, - Okay.

2153
01:12:49,747 --> 01:12:51,746
- we've succeeded in Round One.
- Let's go.

2154
01:12:51,747 --> 01:12:53,186
- Okay.
- Let's keep going.

2155
01:12:53,187 --> 01:12:55,156
- Will you keep going or stop?
- That's right.

2156
01:12:55,157 --> 01:12:57,126
- Please decide.
- Let's keep going.

2157
01:12:57,127 --> 01:12:58,956
- Okay. Round One prize...
- All right.

2158
01:12:58,957 --> 01:13:00,126
- Go.
- Let's keep going.

2159
01:13:00,127 --> 01:13:01,596
This prize is important.

2160
01:13:01,597 --> 01:13:02,797
(He checks the Round 2 prize.)

2161
01:13:03,805 --> 01:13:05,534
"After meeting the deadline, a therapeutic moment begins!"

2162
01:13:05,535 --> 01:13:09,034
"Go on a basketball date with your wife and your son."

2163
01:13:09,035 --> 01:13:11,175
Three matching pairs of Jordan shoes for the family.

2164
01:13:12,005 --> 01:13:13,015
Three pairs?

2165
01:13:13,475 --> 01:13:14,714
How cute!

2166
01:13:14,715 --> 01:13:15,914
(Three pairs of Jordan shoes for the family's basketball date)

2167
01:13:15,915 --> 01:13:17,744
You can wear matching shoes with your child.

2168
01:13:17,745 --> 01:13:19,284
- They're so cute.
- They're cute.

2169
01:13:19,285 --> 01:13:21,485
- They're very pretty.
- They're very pretty.

2170
01:13:22,215 --> 01:13:23,785
- They're very pretty.
- Look at this.

2171
01:13:24,685 --> 01:13:26,825
Hold on. We need to give him this prize.

2172
01:13:26,925 --> 01:13:28,454
- We need to give him this prize.
- We need to do that.

2173
01:13:28,455 --> 01:13:29,564
We need to give him this prize.

2174
01:13:29,565 --> 01:13:30,624
(Round 2)

2175
01:13:30,625 --> 01:13:33,065
(Say the Title and Two Actors)

2176
01:13:34,235 --> 01:13:36,605
Four of us need to succeed in it.

2177
01:13:37,005 --> 01:13:38,364
- Two actors?
- Yes.

2178
01:13:38,365 --> 01:13:39,435
This is hard.

2179
01:13:40,035 --> 01:13:42,104
- It's hard to identify two actors.
- It's hard.

2180
01:13:42,105 --> 01:13:43,274
I can do it if it's one.

2181
01:13:43,275 --> 01:13:45,145
Aren't you overestimating us?

2182
01:13:45,745 --> 01:13:47,174
Answer only if you can think...

2183
01:13:47,175 --> 01:13:48,514
- of two actors.
- Okay.

2184
01:13:48,515 --> 01:13:50,144
- We need to do this.
- In 1, 2, 3.

2185
01:13:50,145 --> 01:13:51,544
- Let's go!
- Numbers 7, 8, 9, and 10.

2186
01:13:51,545 --> 01:13:52,615
Only four tries remain.

2187
01:13:52,985 --> 01:13:54,514
All right. Music,

2188
01:13:54,515 --> 01:13:57,354
(Say the title and two actors to answer correctly.)

2189
01:13:57,355 --> 01:13:58,355
cue.

2190
01:13:58,555 --> 01:14:00,994
(1st question, try number 7)

2191
01:14:00,995 --> 01:14:02,794
- I know this one for sure.
- I know this one for sure.

2192
01:14:02,795 --> 01:14:04,294
- Answer if you know for sure.
- I know this one for sure.

2193
01:14:04,295 --> 01:14:05,964
- Answer if you know for sure.
- I'll answer.

2194
01:14:05,965 --> 01:14:06,994
Go ahead. It's your movie.

2195
01:14:06,995 --> 01:14:08,364
- "Oldboy."
- Okay.

2196
01:14:08,365 --> 01:14:10,004
- Can I say my name?
- Three...

2197
01:14:10,005 --> 01:14:11,334
Choi Min Sik and Yoo Yeon Seok.

2198
01:14:11,335 --> 01:14:12,405
- Correct.
- That's it.

2199
01:14:12,575 --> 01:14:14,975
- Okay.
- Why did you do the easy one?

2200
01:14:15,175 --> 01:14:16,374
No, it's better to go quickly...

2201
01:14:16,375 --> 01:14:17,875
- if you know.
- Okay.

2202
01:14:18,575 --> 01:14:19,845
Even with "Oldboy..."

2203
01:14:20,215 --> 01:14:21,775
You become hesitant, right?

2204
01:14:22,315 --> 01:14:24,545
I thought of fried dumplings. Fried dumplings.

2205
01:14:24,915 --> 01:14:27,255
Fried dumplings and octopus.

2206
01:14:27,355 --> 01:14:29,154
(The food items were as memorable as the lead actors.)

2207
01:14:29,155 --> 01:14:31,424
- The cast members...
- This is...

2208
01:14:31,425 --> 01:14:33,494
- Let's go.
- Three people remain.

2209
01:14:33,495 --> 01:14:35,325
Music, cue.

2210
01:14:36,295 --> 01:14:38,524
(2nd question, try number 7)

2211
01:14:38,525 --> 01:14:39,864
- All right.
- I know this one for sure.

2212
01:14:39,865 --> 01:14:41,634
- What's this?
- You know this one.

2213
01:14:41,635 --> 01:14:42,635
- Let me answer.
- Okay.

2214
01:14:42,636 --> 01:14:44,181
- "The Good, the Bad, the Weird."
- Okay.

2215
01:14:44,205 --> 01:14:45,734
Jung Woo Sung and Song Kang Ho.

2216
01:14:45,735 --> 01:14:46,904
That's right.

2217
01:14:46,905 --> 01:14:48,534
I didn't know it was from "The Good, the Bad, the Weird."

2218
01:14:48,535 --> 01:14:49,975
(He answers easily!)

2219
01:14:51,005 --> 01:14:53,014
I didn't know it was from "The Good, the Bad, the Weird."

2220
01:14:53,015 --> 01:14:54,814
Let's go.

2221
01:14:54,815 --> 01:14:56,914
- Now comes the real deal.
- Yes.

2222
01:14:56,915 --> 01:14:59,015
Let's do this for real.

2223
01:14:59,115 --> 01:15:00,984
I'll use the strategy I used earlier.

2224
01:15:00,985 --> 01:15:01,985
Music...

2225
01:15:01,986 --> 01:15:04,454
I'll imagine watching Whenever Possible at home.

2226
01:15:04,455 --> 01:15:05,785
Music, cue.

2227
01:15:06,855 --> 01:15:09,894
(3rd question, try number 7)

2228
01:15:09,895 --> 01:15:12,495
That music represents how I feel.

2229
01:15:13,265 --> 01:15:14,794
Hold on. What's this?

2230
01:15:14,795 --> 01:15:17,604
(3rd question, try number 7)

2231
01:15:17,605 --> 01:15:19,404
(You know what it is!)

2232
01:15:19,405 --> 01:15:20,604
- Hold on.
- I know what it is.

2233
01:15:20,605 --> 01:15:21,934
- I know. The actors...
- Three,

2234
01:15:21,935 --> 01:15:23,244
- All right.
- two,

2235
01:15:23,245 --> 01:15:24,404
Hold on.

2236
01:15:24,405 --> 01:15:25,444
- one.
- Let me answer.

2237
01:15:25,445 --> 01:15:27,414
"What did you say?" That's right.

2238
01:15:27,415 --> 01:15:28,574
- Let me answer.
- "What did you say?"

2239
01:15:28,575 --> 01:15:30,544
- I'll say the answer. Here I go.
- Go.

2240
01:15:30,545 --> 01:15:31,545
"Ladies of the Palace."

2241
01:15:31,545 --> 01:15:32,545
("Ladies of the Palace")

2242
01:15:32,546 --> 01:15:34,066
- "Ladies of the Palace."
- That's it!

2243
01:15:34,355 --> 01:15:36,554
("Ladies of the Palace," actors)

2244
01:15:36,555 --> 01:15:38,101
- "What did you say?"
- "What did you say?"

2245
01:15:38,125 --> 01:15:39,285
- Incorrect.
- Hold on.

2246
01:15:40,025 --> 01:15:41,354
(His brain stops working after "What did you say?")

2247
01:15:41,355 --> 01:15:43,665
- I don't know this one.
- Do Ji Won says the line.

2248
01:15:44,865 --> 01:15:46,994
- I don't know this one.
- Do Ji Won.

2249
01:15:46,995 --> 01:15:49,164
- Do Ji Won.
- Jeon In Hwa. Lee Duk Hwa.

2250
01:15:49,165 --> 01:15:52,705
- I was going to say Jeon In Hwa.
- Do Ji Won.

2251
01:15:53,575 --> 01:15:55,435
This is hard.

2252
01:15:56,075 --> 01:15:57,874
I was going to say Jeon In Hwa.

2253
01:15:57,875 --> 01:15:59,714
(The names come to them after they fail.)

2254
01:15:59,715 --> 01:16:00,774
Do Ji Won says, "What did you say?"

2255
01:16:00,775 --> 01:16:02,644
- "What did you say?"
- It's really hard.

2256
01:16:02,645 --> 01:16:05,315
- You know...
- He should've participated.

2257
01:16:06,915 --> 01:16:08,684
We don't have a bonus try.

2258
01:16:08,685 --> 01:16:10,454
Do three tries remain?

2259
01:16:10,455 --> 01:16:13,424
Let's do this with determination to succeed in Round Two.

2260
01:16:13,425 --> 01:16:15,224
- Okay.
- Let's go.

2261
01:16:15,225 --> 01:16:16,225
Let's do this.

2262
01:16:16,295 --> 01:16:17,424
- Let's go.
- Let's do this.

2263
01:16:17,425 --> 01:16:18,965
- In 1, 2, 3. Let's go!
- Let's go!

2264
01:16:19,325 --> 01:16:20,464
Music,

2265
01:16:20,465 --> 01:16:21,964
(Out of 10 total tries, they're on try number 8.)

2266
01:16:21,965 --> 01:16:23,065
cue.

2267
01:16:23,505 --> 01:16:26,704
(1st question, try number 8)

2268
01:16:26,705 --> 01:16:28,175
I can think of a popular line.

2269
01:16:28,875 --> 01:16:30,105
Hold on.

2270
01:16:31,505 --> 01:16:32,944
- Shall I go?
- No.

2271
01:16:32,945 --> 01:16:34,215
- Go.
- Okay.

2272
01:16:34,575 --> 01:16:35,744
- "New World."
- Okay.

2273
01:16:35,745 --> 01:16:36,745
("New World," actors)

2274
01:16:36,746 --> 01:16:39,484
Hwang Jung Min and Lee Jung Jae.

2275
01:16:39,485 --> 01:16:40,514
- There you go.
- Correct.

2276
01:16:40,515 --> 01:16:42,255
- Well done. We averted the crisis.
- Yes.

2277
01:16:42,355 --> 01:16:43,585
- Well done.
- Yes.

2278
01:16:44,925 --> 01:16:46,254
- Did no one know the answer?
- I knew it.

2279
01:16:46,255 --> 01:16:47,525
- I knew it.
- Right?

2280
01:16:47,725 --> 01:16:48,795
Next.

2281
01:16:49,025 --> 01:16:51,525
Music, cue.

2282
01:16:52,525 --> 01:16:57,004
(2nd question, try number 8)

2283
01:16:57,005 --> 01:16:59,105
I haven't watched many romance dramas.

2284
01:16:59,535 --> 01:17:01,274
If no one knows, may I give it a go?

2285
01:17:01,275 --> 01:17:02,974
- Go.
- Don't you know?

2286
01:17:02,975 --> 01:17:04,075
- No.
- No.

2287
01:17:04,875 --> 01:17:06,214
"You Are the Best!"

2288
01:17:06,215 --> 01:17:07,314
- Incorrect.
- What?

2289
01:17:07,315 --> 01:17:08,575
"The Greatest Love."

2290
01:17:09,245 --> 01:17:10,385
"The Greatest Love."

2291
01:17:11,015 --> 01:17:13,061
- "The Greatest Love."
- There's a line, "I overcame!"

2292
01:17:13,085 --> 01:17:14,414
- That's right.
- Seung Won.

2293
01:17:14,415 --> 01:17:16,455
Seung Won starred in it. I remember it now.

2294
01:17:17,185 --> 01:17:19,794
- Kong... Kong Hyo Jin.
- Seung Won starred in it.

2295
01:17:19,795 --> 01:17:21,435
- Hyo Jin and Seung Won.
- Cha Seung Won.

2296
01:17:22,455 --> 01:17:24,565
- "You Are the Best!"
- "You Are the Best!"

2297
01:17:25,325 --> 01:17:26,334
You really are the best.

2298
01:17:26,335 --> 01:17:27,564
- Do Hoon, seriously.
- You're the best.

2299
01:17:27,565 --> 01:17:28,734
- You're the best, Kim Do Hoon.
- I mean...

2300
01:17:28,735 --> 01:17:30,534
- We can't complain, Do Hoon.
- Okay.

2301
01:17:30,535 --> 01:17:32,105
We can't complain,

2302
01:17:32,335 --> 01:17:33,674
- but you...
- You...

2303
01:17:33,675 --> 01:17:35,875
You had the vague idea.

2304
01:17:36,345 --> 01:17:38,374
- What was that?
- You keep...

2305
01:17:38,375 --> 01:17:42,245
- I can't forget about "Mamma Mia!"
- I know.

2306
01:17:42,785 --> 01:17:44,215
We can't complain.

2307
01:17:44,415 --> 01:17:45,744
- Seriously.
- Why did you think...

2308
01:17:45,745 --> 01:17:47,145
it was the "You Are the Best!" OST?

2309
01:17:47,285 --> 01:17:49,314
("You Are the Best!," a KBS drama starring Cho Jung Seok and IU)

2310
01:17:49,315 --> 01:17:50,325
I don't know either.

2311
01:17:52,125 --> 01:17:53,694
When I think about it,

2312
01:17:53,695 --> 01:17:56,095
it's a total mystery.

2313
01:17:56,425 --> 01:17:58,195
Only two tries remain. Seriously.

2314
01:17:58,965 --> 01:18:00,864
I have a good feeling about this try.

2315
01:18:00,865 --> 01:18:01,865
- Really?
- Yes.

2316
01:18:01,866 --> 01:18:03,834
- We need to succeed in it now.
- If you don't have that feeling...

2317
01:18:03,835 --> 01:18:05,664
- We need to succeed in it now.
- Let's succeed in it.

2318
01:18:05,665 --> 01:18:07,434
- We need to succeed in it now.
- In 1, 2, 3. Let's go!

2319
01:18:07,435 --> 01:18:09,155
- We need to succeed in it now.
- Let's go!

2320
01:18:09,335 --> 01:18:11,475
Gosh, I'm traumatized.

2321
01:18:11,975 --> 01:18:14,044
We need to succeed in it when it's the ninth try.

2322
01:18:14,045 --> 01:18:16,245
Music, cue.

2323
01:18:17,515 --> 01:18:20,684
(1st question, try number 9)

2324
01:18:20,685 --> 01:18:22,455
- It's Bum Soo's song.
- That's right.

2325
01:18:22,615 --> 01:18:23,724
Don't you know the answer?

2326
01:18:23,725 --> 01:18:24,924
- Hold on.
- I know.

2327
01:18:24,925 --> 01:18:27,494
- If you know, go ahead.
- Go ahead.

2328
01:18:27,495 --> 01:18:29,194
- May I answer? Really?
- Go ahead.

2329
01:18:29,195 --> 01:18:30,524
- "Secret Garden."
- Okay.

2330
01:18:30,525 --> 01:18:32,195
- Hyun Bin and Ha Ji Won.
- There you go.

2331
01:18:32,665 --> 01:18:34,864
- There you go.
- Do Hoon is good.

2332
01:18:34,865 --> 01:18:38,735
There you go. Do Hoon, you're good.

2333
01:18:39,105 --> 01:18:41,105
You're good. We're set.

2334
01:18:41,205 --> 01:18:42,304
I couldn't think of the title.

2335
01:18:42,305 --> 01:18:43,305
You're good.

2336
01:18:43,306 --> 01:18:45,444
(You're the best, Kim Do Hoon!)

2337
01:18:45,445 --> 01:18:47,544
- I couldn't think of the title.
- You're good.

2338
01:18:47,545 --> 01:18:49,584
(Do Hoon passed on the ninth try.)

2339
01:18:49,585 --> 01:18:50,815
- Seriously.
- Let's go.

2340
01:18:51,345 --> 01:18:52,744
- Thank goodness.
- Three people remain.

2341
01:18:52,745 --> 01:18:54,414
- Music, - Relax.

2342
01:18:54,415 --> 01:18:55,515
- cue.
- I'm in trouble.

2343
01:18:56,225 --> 01:18:57,524
(2nd question, try number 9)

2344
01:18:57,525 --> 01:19:00,124
All right. Let's go. Hold on.

2345
01:19:00,125 --> 01:19:01,125
I can't think of the actors' names.

2346
01:19:01,126 --> 01:19:03,094
(2nd question, try number 9)

2347
01:19:03,095 --> 01:19:05,225
(I worked on this!)

2348
01:19:05,525 --> 01:19:06,734
I can't think of the names.

2349
01:19:06,735 --> 01:19:09,064
- Three, two, one.
- Hold on.

2350
01:19:09,065 --> 01:19:10,164
- Let me answer.
- Okay.

2351
01:19:10,165 --> 01:19:12,005
No one is answering.

2352
01:19:12,305 --> 01:19:13,705
Right now,

2353
01:19:13,935 --> 01:19:17,074
- no one is answering.
- Three, two, one.

2354
01:19:17,075 --> 01:19:18,974
- Shall I answer?
- Yes.

2355
01:19:18,975 --> 01:19:20,674
- It's his work.
- Three, two, one.

2356
01:19:20,675 --> 01:19:22,045
- "Be Melodramatic."
- Yes.

2357
01:19:22,145 --> 01:19:23,145
That's right.

2358
01:19:23,146 --> 01:19:25,614
- Ahn Jae Hong.
- That's right. One more.

2359
01:19:25,615 --> 01:19:26,955
I remember!

2360
01:19:27,585 --> 01:19:29,854
- Ahn Jae Hong.
- One more. I remember!

2361
01:19:29,855 --> 01:19:30,955
Lee Ju Bin.

2362
01:19:31,385 --> 01:19:32,385
That's right.

2363
01:19:32,755 --> 01:19:36,225
(He did it!)

2364
01:19:39,465 --> 01:19:41,164
Seo Hyun Jin.

2365
01:19:41,165 --> 01:19:42,464
No, it's Lee Ju Bin.

2366
01:19:42,465 --> 01:19:45,365
Seo Hyun Jin, my foot. You're spouting nonsense.

2367
01:19:45,505 --> 01:19:46,605
Isn't it Hyun Jin?

2368
01:19:47,175 --> 01:19:48,274
- Thank goodness I didn't answer.
- Chun Woo Hee.

2369
01:19:48,275 --> 01:19:51,704
I couldn't remember Chun Woo Hee's name.

2370
01:19:51,705 --> 01:19:52,974
All right.

2371
01:19:52,975 --> 01:19:54,344
- All right.
- Two questions remain.

2372
01:19:54,345 --> 01:19:56,014
- You and...
- Music,

2373
01:19:56,015 --> 01:19:57,214
(Yeon Seok and Jae Suk remain.)

2374
01:19:57,215 --> 01:19:58,215
cue.

2375
01:19:59,015 --> 01:20:01,054
(3rd question, try number 9)

2376
01:20:01,055 --> 01:20:02,055
What?

2377
01:20:02,715 --> 01:20:03,755
Hold on.

2378
01:20:04,155 --> 01:20:07,394
Do you know? Don't you know?

2379
01:20:07,395 --> 01:20:09,724
- Go ahead.
- But one actor... Wait. The name...

2380
01:20:09,725 --> 01:20:11,294
- All right.
- Three, two...

2381
01:20:11,295 --> 01:20:13,735
- "Itaewon Class."
- Okay.

2382
01:20:14,065 --> 01:20:15,334
- Park Seo Jun.
- There you go.

2383
01:20:15,335 --> 01:20:16,664
- And the other one was...
- Two,

2384
01:20:16,665 --> 01:20:17,985
- "You Quiz on the Block."
- one.

2385
01:20:18,635 --> 01:20:19,674
- Incorrect.
- Shin Min A.

2386
01:20:19,675 --> 01:20:21,334
("Itaewon Class," Park Seo Jun, Shin Min A)

2387
01:20:21,335 --> 01:20:22,575
- Incorrect.
- Shin Min A.

2388
01:20:26,445 --> 01:20:27,914
- I know.
- She was on the show.

2389
01:20:27,915 --> 01:20:28,944
She was on the show recently.

2390
01:20:28,945 --> 01:20:32,185
- "The Witch." My goodness.
- Kim Da Mi.

2391
01:20:32,785 --> 01:20:33,785
The thing is,

2392
01:20:33,786 --> 01:20:36,215
Shin Min A made a brief appearance on the drama.

2393
01:20:37,325 --> 01:20:38,784
- Hey, check.
- Let's see.

2394
01:20:38,785 --> 01:20:40,554
- Special appearance.
- Check.

2395
01:20:40,555 --> 01:20:42,294
Maybe she made a special appearance.

2396
01:20:42,295 --> 01:20:44,264
(Did she make a special appearance on "Itaewon Class?")

2397
01:20:44,265 --> 01:20:45,824
- No.
- No?

2398
01:20:45,825 --> 01:20:47,265
- I was joking.
- Really?

2399
01:20:48,435 --> 01:20:50,234
But maybe she was...

2400
01:20:50,235 --> 01:20:52,564
in the full shot.

2401
01:20:52,565 --> 01:20:54,534
- Then it's 100 percent right.
- Seo Jun and I...

2402
01:20:54,535 --> 01:20:57,104
met up recently.

2403
01:20:57,105 --> 01:20:58,245
We're in trouble.

2404
01:20:59,505 --> 01:21:02,514
- Yoo Jae Myung.
- Da Mi was on Whenever Possible.

2405
01:21:02,515 --> 01:21:04,485
You remember everything after the quiz.

2406
01:21:04,745 --> 01:21:05,985
- That's right.
- Seriously.

2407
01:21:06,615 --> 01:21:07,784
(It's time for the last try.)

2408
01:21:07,785 --> 01:21:08,885
I'm stressed out.

2409
01:21:12,155 --> 01:21:14,195
- One try remains.
- One try remains.

2410
01:21:14,955 --> 01:21:17,225
- I think you'll succeed in it.
- Okay.

2411
01:21:18,195 --> 01:21:20,464
We want to begin the new year on a happy note.

2412
01:21:20,465 --> 01:21:22,934
- Let's succeed in this round.
- Okay.

2413
01:21:22,935 --> 01:21:24,304
- We need to succeed in it.
- Seriously.

2414
01:21:24,305 --> 01:21:25,604
- Okay.
- We can't back down.

2415
01:21:25,605 --> 01:21:26,974
- We can't back down.
- We can't back down.

2416
01:21:26,975 --> 01:21:28,681
- Let's bring our energy together.
- We can't back down.

2417
01:21:28,705 --> 01:21:30,104
- Seriously. In 1, 2, 3.
- In 1, 2, 3.

2418
01:21:30,105 --> 01:21:31,105
- Let's go!
- Let's go!

2419
01:21:31,705 --> 01:21:35,714
(It's the very last try.)

2420
01:21:35,715 --> 01:21:39,285
If we fail...

2421
01:21:40,315 --> 01:21:42,784
(We want to begin the new year on a happy note.)

2422
01:21:42,785 --> 01:21:45,384
Let's proceed with the last try. It's the last try.

2423
01:21:45,385 --> 01:21:46,424
In 1, 2, 3.

2424
01:21:46,425 --> 01:21:47,505
- Here we go!
- Here we go!

2425
01:21:48,155 --> 01:21:50,694
Music. It's the last try. Music,

2426
01:21:50,695 --> 01:21:53,095
(Out of 10 total tries, they're on the last try.)

2427
01:21:54,165 --> 01:21:55,265
cue.

2428
01:21:55,695 --> 01:21:57,264
(1st question, last try)

2429
01:21:57,265 --> 01:21:58,304
All right.

2430
01:21:58,305 --> 01:22:00,434
(1st question, last try)

2431
01:22:00,435 --> 01:22:01,674
- Isn't it this one?
- Shall I go?

2432
01:22:01,675 --> 01:22:02,675
- Isn't it this one?
- Shall I go?

2433
01:22:02,676 --> 01:22:03,905
Sure.

2434
01:22:04,045 --> 01:22:06,444
- It's this one.
- Why is no one going? Go ahead.

2435
01:22:06,445 --> 01:22:08,944
If I answer hurriedly and get it wrong...

2436
01:22:08,945 --> 01:22:10,344
- Hurry up and answer.
- Me?

2437
01:22:10,345 --> 01:22:11,514
- Three...
- Let me answer.

2438
01:22:11,515 --> 01:22:12,944
- Okay.
- "Jewel in the Palace."

2439
01:22:12,945 --> 01:22:15,514
- Okay.
- Lee Young Ae, Lim Ho.

2440
01:22:15,515 --> 01:22:16,655
- Correct.
- Okay.

2441
01:22:16,985 --> 01:22:18,554
- Lim Ho.
- Correct.

2442
01:22:18,555 --> 01:22:19,584
Okay.

2443
01:22:19,585 --> 01:22:21,295
Why did you suddenly bring up Lim Ho?

2444
01:22:21,425 --> 01:22:23,164
Why did you suddenly bring up Lim Ho?

2445
01:22:23,165 --> 01:22:24,195
(He played Jungjong.)

2446
01:22:24,265 --> 01:22:26,265
I haven't heard Ho's name in a long time.

2447
01:22:27,035 --> 01:22:28,995
- Wasn't Im Hyun Sik in it?
- Yes, he was.

2448
01:22:29,295 --> 01:22:31,104
- Didn't I do well?
- You did a great job.

2449
01:22:31,105 --> 01:22:33,151
- You succeeded in answering.
- You did a great job.

2450
01:22:33,175 --> 01:22:34,604
I did the image training before answering.

2451
01:22:34,605 --> 01:22:35,975
You almost became a sinner.

2452
01:22:36,005 --> 01:22:37,604
- You need to delve into the scene.
- Okay.

2453
01:22:37,605 --> 01:22:39,714
You need to delve into the scene before answering.

2454
01:22:39,715 --> 01:22:40,744
The scene?

2455
01:22:40,745 --> 01:22:42,614
You need to delve into the scene...

2456
01:22:42,615 --> 01:22:43,914
and check the actors.

2457
01:22:43,915 --> 01:22:44,915
- That's right.
- Okay?

2458
01:22:44,916 --> 01:22:46,414
- Were you with Lim Ho?
- Yes.

2459
01:22:46,415 --> 01:22:48,015
I was with Lim Ho.

2460
01:22:48,285 --> 01:22:49,384
Did he play a king?

2461
01:22:49,385 --> 01:22:50,485
He played a king.

2462
01:22:50,655 --> 01:22:53,095
- Jae Seok passed.
- Okay.

2463
01:22:53,225 --> 01:22:54,225
I'm jealous.

2464
01:22:54,295 --> 01:22:56,695
Music, cue.

2465
01:22:57,895 --> 01:23:02,134
(2nd question, last try)

2466
01:23:02,135 --> 01:23:03,235
This one... Hold on.

2467
01:23:05,235 --> 01:23:06,704
- He has it.
- It's...

2468
01:23:06,705 --> 01:23:08,105
- He has it.
- You know what it is.

2469
01:23:08,205 --> 01:23:09,235
Let me answer.

2470
01:23:09,305 --> 01:23:10,345
- "Parasite."
- Okay.

2471
01:23:11,045 --> 01:23:13,375
- Three, two...
- Song Kang Ho, Lee Jung Eun.

2472
01:23:13,575 --> 01:23:15,044
- Okay.
- That's right.

2473
01:23:15,045 --> 01:23:17,915
Why did you say, "Okay?"

2474
01:23:18,085 --> 01:23:19,985
- I was thinking about Yeo Jeong.
- All right.

2475
01:23:20,885 --> 01:23:22,114
(He succeeds in answering the second question.)

2476
01:23:22,115 --> 01:23:23,454
Okay. There you go.

2477
01:23:23,455 --> 01:23:24,585
Well done.

2478
01:23:25,185 --> 01:23:26,224
- Well done.
- All right.

2479
01:23:26,225 --> 01:23:28,001
- Two people remain. Good luck.
- We got this.

2480
01:23:28,025 --> 01:23:29,895
- Why are his lips so white?
- All right.

2481
01:23:30,525 --> 01:23:31,764
I need to relax.

2482
01:23:31,765 --> 01:23:32,895
Why are his lips so white?

2483
01:23:33,765 --> 01:23:35,334
- Two people remain.
- Let's succeed in this round.

2484
01:23:35,335 --> 01:23:36,365
I'll relax.

2485
01:23:36,435 --> 01:23:37,704
Music,

2486
01:23:37,705 --> 01:23:39,305
- Think that you're here for fun.
- cue.

2487
01:23:39,705 --> 01:23:41,235
Think that you're at a cafe.

2488
01:23:41,935 --> 01:23:43,404
That's right. You got it.

2489
01:23:43,405 --> 01:23:44,975
(3rd question, last try)

2490
01:23:45,075 --> 01:23:47,745
(What's this intro?)

2491
01:23:48,975 --> 01:23:50,914
(This music reminds us...)

2492
01:23:50,915 --> 01:23:53,985
(of two very handsome and mysterious men.)

2493
01:23:54,355 --> 01:23:55,754
(Did they delve into the scene?)

2494
01:23:55,755 --> 01:23:57,385
- Shall I go first?
- Yes.

2495
01:23:57,825 --> 01:23:58,825
- Let me answer.
- Okay.

2496
01:23:59,055 --> 01:24:00,535
"Guardian: The Lonely and Great God."

2497
01:24:00,655 --> 01:24:02,024
- Gong Yoo.
- There you go.

2498
01:24:02,025 --> 01:24:03,325
- Two...
- Yoon Kyung Ho.

2499
01:24:03,795 --> 01:24:05,264
- Correct.
- Was Kyung Ho in the drama?

2500
01:24:05,265 --> 01:24:06,834
I thought Yoon Kyung Ho was incorrect.

2501
01:24:06,835 --> 01:24:08,634
- I thought you'd mention Dong Wook.
- I thought of Dong Wook.

2502
01:24:08,635 --> 01:24:09,695
- No.
- Suddenly...

2503
01:24:09,965 --> 01:24:11,964
I had to mention Kyung Ho's name.

2504
01:24:11,965 --> 01:24:14,435
- You delved into the scene.
- Yes.

2505
01:24:14,675 --> 01:24:16,405
I got stabbed by a sword.

2506
01:24:16,605 --> 01:24:18,474
- You delved into that scene.
- I had the answer.

2507
01:24:18,475 --> 01:24:20,074
- I was relaxed.
- Yeon Shik.

2508
01:24:20,075 --> 01:24:21,815
- I didn't think of Kyung Ho.
- Yeon Shik.

2509
01:24:21,915 --> 01:24:22,975
Hold on.

2510
01:24:23,445 --> 01:24:24,445
Yeon Shik.

2511
01:24:24,545 --> 01:24:26,384
- Now...
- Let's begin.

2512
01:24:26,385 --> 01:24:27,785
- Let's go.
- All right.

2513
01:24:27,885 --> 01:24:30,485
Let's succeed in Round Two in the new year.

2514
01:24:30,825 --> 01:24:32,755
It's the Year of the Red Horse.

2515
01:24:32,955 --> 01:24:35,024
(The last question of the last mission of the day)

2516
01:24:35,025 --> 01:24:37,365
- Let's wrap it up well.
- Yes. Let's do a good job.

2517
01:24:37,695 --> 01:24:38,695
Let's go.

2518
01:24:39,195 --> 01:24:40,265
Music...

2519
01:24:44,705 --> 01:24:46,905
Music, cue.

2520
01:24:47,505 --> 01:24:50,474
(Last question, last try)

2521
01:24:50,475 --> 01:24:52,155
- Hold on. But...
- They gave an easy one.

2522
01:24:52,445 --> 01:24:53,474
The title...

2523
01:24:53,475 --> 01:24:54,814
(Last question, last try)

2524
01:24:54,815 --> 01:24:57,485
(What's this music?)

2525
01:24:59,415 --> 01:25:02,885
("Friend" starring Jang Dong Gun and Yu Oh Seong)

2526
01:25:05,755 --> 01:25:07,854
(Across the dimension, )

2527
01:25:07,855 --> 01:25:12,065
(someone enters the scene.)

2528
01:25:13,635 --> 01:25:17,235
(Did Yeon Seok see them?)

2529
01:25:21,105 --> 01:25:22,105
"The Rising Sun..."

2530
01:25:22,535 --> 01:25:23,644
- What?
- Hey.

2531
01:25:23,645 --> 01:25:24,975
- Incorrect.
- No.

2532
01:25:25,145 --> 01:25:27,114
- He hasn't answered yet.
- He hasn't answered yet.

2533
01:25:27,115 --> 01:25:28,444
- He hasn't answered yet.
- It isn't over yet.

2534
01:25:28,445 --> 01:25:30,091
- He hasn't answered yet.
- It isn't over yet.

2535
01:25:30,115 --> 01:25:31,715
We didn't get much sun today.

2536
01:25:31,885 --> 01:25:33,254
- Although it was cloudy...
- What?

2537
01:25:33,255 --> 01:25:34,755
- Hey.
- What?

2538
01:25:35,755 --> 01:25:36,984
- What?
- Incorrect.

2539
01:25:36,985 --> 01:25:38,854
- Doctor, doctor - So...

2540
01:25:38,855 --> 01:25:40,795
Lee Jung Jae and...

2541
01:25:41,125 --> 01:25:42,854
Jung Woo Sung starred in it.

2542
01:25:42,855 --> 01:25:44,794
What? What are you saying?

2543
01:25:44,795 --> 01:25:47,264
- What?
- I thought so, but...

2544
01:25:47,265 --> 01:25:49,064
- Hey, that isn't it.
- You thought so,

2545
01:25:49,065 --> 01:25:50,504
- but you were mistaken.
- Come on.

2546
01:25:50,505 --> 01:25:51,634
(Yeon Seok is thinking about "City of the Rising Sun.")

2547
01:25:51,635 --> 01:25:53,134
- You thought so, - Hey.

2548
01:25:53,135 --> 01:25:55,015
- but you were mistaken.
- It isn't that movie.

2549
01:25:55,475 --> 01:25:56,674
You're mistaken.

2550
01:25:56,675 --> 01:25:58,375
- What?
- Even now...

2551
01:25:58,575 --> 01:25:59,605
Hey!

2552
01:25:59,705 --> 01:26:01,574
Since it was cloudy...

2553
01:26:01,575 --> 01:26:03,645
It wasn't his answer. Hold on.

2554
01:26:04,015 --> 01:26:05,244
(Whiskey and shoes disappear.)

2555
01:26:05,245 --> 01:26:07,614
- Wait. The negotiation isn't over.
- So ruthless!

2556
01:26:07,615 --> 01:26:08,615
The negotiation isn't over.

2557
01:26:08,616 --> 01:26:10,955
It's the movie with the line, "You go to Hawaii."

2558
01:26:11,255 --> 01:26:12,984
- This is...
- You're right.

2559
01:26:12,985 --> 01:26:14,954
It's the scene where they run in the market.

2560
01:26:14,955 --> 01:26:16,225
That's right.

2561
01:26:16,865 --> 01:26:19,325
What you're thinking about is "Love Potion No. 9."

2562
01:26:19,995 --> 01:26:22,364
- Love potion No. 9 - Love potion No. 9

2563
01:26:22,365 --> 01:26:23,435
This is...

2564
01:26:24,035 --> 01:26:26,004
("Love Potion No. 9," OST of "City of the Rising Sun")

2565
01:26:26,005 --> 01:26:27,604
(No sun, no miracles)

2566
01:26:27,605 --> 01:26:29,805
They gave an easy one.

2567
01:26:30,645 --> 01:26:31,945
- Thank you.
- We're sorry.

2568
01:26:31,975 --> 01:26:33,414
- It's okay.
- We're so sorry.

2569
01:26:33,415 --> 01:26:34,645
It's okay. Thank you.

2570
01:26:35,075 --> 01:26:36,985
- My goodness.
- It's very pretty.

2571
01:26:37,985 --> 01:26:40,514
(You don't have to force yourself.)

2572
01:26:40,515 --> 01:26:42,014
What a soulless comment.

2573
01:26:42,015 --> 01:26:43,285
It's very pretty.

2574
01:26:44,285 --> 01:26:45,725
- We're sorry.
- We're sorry.

2575
01:26:45,785 --> 01:26:46,824
It's okay.

2576
01:26:46,825 --> 01:26:47,854
(OST of "The First Ride," written by Jung Sang Woo)

2577
01:26:47,855 --> 01:26:48,955
(Royalty)

2578
01:26:49,195 --> 01:26:50,265
It's pretty indeed.

2579
01:26:50,425 --> 01:26:51,725
It's very cute.

2580
01:26:51,895 --> 01:26:55,194
Tae Hyun and Do Hoon joined us for the shoot...

2581
01:26:55,195 --> 01:26:56,334
- today.
- It was fun.

2582
01:26:56,335 --> 01:26:58,404
I hope you'll be healthy...

2583
01:26:58,405 --> 01:27:00,335
and happy this year.

2584
01:27:00,475 --> 01:27:02,804
- Happy New Year.
- Happy New Year.

2585
01:27:02,805 --> 01:27:04,081
(We hope you'll begin 2026 with a smile!)

2586
01:27:04,105 --> 01:27:05,345
Thank you.

2587
01:27:05,645 --> 01:27:06,875
- We're sorry.
- It's okay.
