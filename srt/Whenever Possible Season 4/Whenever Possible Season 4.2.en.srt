1
00:00:12,575 --> 00:00:14,275
We need to get the Christmas vibe going.

2
00:00:15,015 --> 00:00:16,291
Did you set up a Christmas tree?

3
00:00:16,315 --> 00:00:18,185
I couldn't do it this year. I was too busy.

4
00:00:18,515 --> 00:00:19,615
I should, though.

5
00:00:20,085 --> 00:00:21,814
It's crazy in Europe right now.

6
00:00:21,815 --> 00:00:24,254
Right. It's crazy in South America too.

7
00:00:24,255 --> 00:00:25,255
- Really?
- Yes.

8
00:00:25,256 --> 00:00:27,795
So you had a fan-meet in South America.

9
00:00:28,255 --> 00:00:29,354
(Yeon Seok went on a fan-meet tour over 2 weeks in South America.)

10
00:00:29,355 --> 00:00:31,024
- For two weeks.
- So they showed up, right?

11
00:00:31,025 --> 00:00:33,171
- Your fans were there, right?
- What's that supposed to mean?

12
00:00:33,195 --> 00:00:34,734
- The auditorium was full.
- Really?

13
00:00:34,735 --> 00:00:36,434
- Yes.
- That's a relief.

14
00:00:36,435 --> 00:00:39,235
- I was quite worried.
- Why would you be worried?

15
00:00:39,405 --> 00:00:42,134
- I went because I had fans there.
- I mean, you might've gone there...

16
00:00:42,135 --> 00:00:43,445
- to make new fans.
- No.

17
00:00:43,905 --> 00:00:46,174
- It took me a while to find them.
- Okay.

18
00:00:46,175 --> 00:00:48,291
But there was a group of fans waiting for you, right?

19
00:00:48,315 --> 00:00:49,851
- Did you have to look for them?
- By the way,

20
00:00:49,875 --> 00:00:50,944
during the fan-meet,

21
00:00:50,945 --> 00:00:52,914
- Right.
- we played a game.

22
00:00:52,915 --> 00:00:55,314
So at the fan-meet, we played one of the games...

23
00:00:55,315 --> 00:00:57,024
- from the show.
- Okay.

24
00:00:57,025 --> 00:00:58,685
You're making good use of our games.

25
00:00:59,425 --> 00:01:00,824
- They're amazing.
- Yes.

26
00:01:00,825 --> 00:01:02,594
- My fans loved it.
- Okay.

27
00:01:02,595 --> 00:01:04,094
People in South America...

28
00:01:04,095 --> 00:01:06,664
- are very passionate.
- Gosh.

29
00:01:06,665 --> 00:01:08,164
People in South America are so passionate.

30
00:01:08,165 --> 00:01:09,564
There were 1,000 people.

31
00:01:09,565 --> 00:01:11,704
But it felt like there were 2,000 or 3,000 people.

32
00:01:11,705 --> 00:01:12,835
That's how loud it was.

33
00:01:13,065 --> 00:01:14,274
- So...
- They were so responsive.

34
00:01:14,275 --> 00:01:15,734
So there were 100 fans,

35
00:01:15,735 --> 00:01:17,244
but they screamed like there were 1,000 people?

36
00:01:17,245 --> 00:01:18,245
- Right.
- Okay.

37
00:01:18,246 --> 00:01:19,775
No. There were more than 100.

38
00:01:20,015 --> 00:01:21,844
There were 1,000 fans.

39
00:01:21,845 --> 00:01:23,274
- I see.
- But it sounded like...

40
00:01:23,275 --> 00:01:25,344
- That's how loud it sounded.
- there were 2,000 or 3,000. Yes.

41
00:01:25,345 --> 00:01:27,255
Something is off. I ought to check it.

42
00:01:27,285 --> 00:01:29,515
So you're not going to tell us who's joining us today?

43
00:01:30,185 --> 00:01:32,055
- I know.
- How?

44
00:01:32,455 --> 00:01:33,625
My school senior...

45
00:01:34,395 --> 00:01:36,794
works at the production studio...

46
00:01:36,795 --> 00:01:38,064
of this movie.

47
00:01:38,065 --> 00:01:39,664
So? I see. He must have called you.

48
00:01:39,665 --> 00:01:41,634
Yes. He told me yesterday.

49
00:01:41,635 --> 00:01:42,734
- He told you yesterday?
- Yes.

50
00:01:42,735 --> 00:01:43,805
What kind of movie is it?

51
00:01:44,105 --> 00:01:45,864
It's a remake movie...

52
00:01:45,865 --> 00:01:48,334
- of a Japanese movie.
- I see.

53
00:01:48,335 --> 00:01:50,421
Well, we have to listen to their introduction for details.

54
00:01:50,445 --> 00:01:52,775
If I give away all the details, it won't be fun.

55
00:01:52,805 --> 00:01:54,074
It's not about fun.

56
00:01:54,075 --> 00:01:55,915
Why would you be the one introducing it?

57
00:01:56,715 --> 00:01:58,285
Then why did you ask me?

58
00:01:58,445 --> 00:01:59,614
- I was curious.
- Wait.

59
00:01:59,615 --> 00:02:02,355
No one came from the production studio. So I asked you.

60
00:02:02,455 --> 00:02:04,955
- You can ask them once they come.
- I mean...

61
00:02:05,055 --> 00:02:06,424
- I don't have to know.
- Okay.

62
00:02:06,425 --> 00:02:07,754
But the viewers could be curious.

63
00:02:07,755 --> 00:02:09,895
Just ask me about my fan-meet in South America.

64
00:02:10,995 --> 00:02:13,094
- Did you live around here? Or...
- Yes.

65
00:02:13,095 --> 00:02:16,265
- I used to live in Seokgye.
- Okay.

66
00:02:16,765 --> 00:02:19,435
I used to drink here after practicing for plays.

67
00:02:21,075 --> 00:02:22,775
I'm a bit nervous, by the way.

68
00:02:22,875 --> 00:02:24,505
- Really?
- Yes. Let's do this.

69
00:02:24,575 --> 00:02:26,951
- One, two, three. Let's do this.
- One, two, three. Let's do this.

70
00:02:26,975 --> 00:02:27,975
- Okay.
- Okay.

71
00:02:27,976 --> 00:02:29,075
(Let's do this.)

72
00:02:29,415 --> 00:02:31,144
- This year...
- We're going to present...

73
00:02:31,145 --> 00:02:33,885
the Best Rookie Award at the awards ceremony.

74
00:02:34,285 --> 00:02:35,555
- They're here.
- Gosh.

75
00:02:36,055 --> 00:02:37,724
- Gosh. It's Si Ah.
- My gosh.

76
00:02:37,725 --> 00:02:39,084
- Hello.
- Hello.

77
00:02:39,085 --> 00:02:41,045
(Whenever Friends: Shin Si Ah and Choo Young Woo)

78
00:02:41,625 --> 00:02:44,595
(Yang Jae Won of "The Trauma Code: Heroes on Call")

79
00:02:44,995 --> 00:02:47,195
Get the spinal needle and the ultrasound machine ready.

80
00:02:47,335 --> 00:02:48,694
As long as they have their father...

81
00:02:48,695 --> 00:02:52,105
(The actor on the rise, Choo Young Woo)

82
00:02:52,605 --> 00:02:55,234
("The Witch: Part 2," "The Old Woman With The Knife,")

83
00:02:55,235 --> 00:02:58,905
(and "Resident Playbook")

84
00:02:59,445 --> 00:03:01,514
(The next-generation blue-chip actress, Shin Si Ah, )

85
00:03:01,515 --> 00:03:03,715
(showcases unexpected charms in her projects.)

86
00:03:04,215 --> 00:03:05,585
(Happy to meet them)

87
00:03:06,685 --> 00:03:08,084
- Oh, my.
- My gosh.

88
00:03:08,085 --> 00:03:09,584
(Fascinated to meet Almighty Yoo for the first time)

89
00:03:09,585 --> 00:03:10,754
- It's been a while, Young Woo.
- Hello.

90
00:03:10,755 --> 00:03:11,884
- Sit down.
- Hello.

91
00:03:11,885 --> 00:03:13,554
- Hello.
- Hey.

92
00:03:13,555 --> 00:03:15,054
- Sit here.
- Sit down.

93
00:03:15,055 --> 00:03:16,495
- Go in.
- Okay.

94
00:03:17,795 --> 00:03:19,394
- We've never met, right?
- Right.

95
00:03:19,395 --> 00:03:20,464
Right.

96
00:03:20,465 --> 00:03:21,865
(Shy)

97
00:03:23,335 --> 00:03:25,234
(Si Ah is meeting Jae Suk for the first time.)

98
00:03:25,235 --> 00:03:26,704
- Sit down, Young Woo.
- Okay.

99
00:03:26,705 --> 00:03:28,375
I've met Young Woo before.

100
00:03:28,835 --> 00:03:30,074
He was in college when I met him...

101
00:03:30,075 --> 00:03:31,444
on "You Quiz on the Block."

102
00:03:31,445 --> 00:03:33,104
- Right.
- I interviewed him them.

103
00:03:33,105 --> 00:03:34,391
(He was on "You Quiz on the Block" when he was attending college.)

104
00:03:34,415 --> 00:03:36,744
It might be a bit of stretch to say...

105
00:03:36,745 --> 00:03:38,915
"You Quiz on the Block" paved the path for his career.

106
00:03:39,285 --> 00:03:40,405
But the show discovered him.

107
00:03:41,055 --> 00:03:43,414
(The discovered gem has become a star now.)

108
00:03:43,415 --> 00:03:45,854
I actually heard about you guys.

109
00:03:45,855 --> 00:03:49,525
"Please take good care of Young Woo and Si Ah."

110
00:03:49,625 --> 00:03:51,765
Someone from the production studio called him.

111
00:03:52,225 --> 00:03:53,471
- Right.
- He called me yesterday.

112
00:03:53,495 --> 00:03:55,234
But there's nothing I can do for them.

113
00:03:55,235 --> 00:03:57,534
There's not much Yeon Seok can do...

114
00:03:57,535 --> 00:03:58,934
- because of this favor.
- There's nothing.

115
00:03:58,935 --> 00:04:01,305
- There's nothing he can do.
- Yes. Well...

116
00:04:01,505 --> 00:04:03,274
- You guys have to do well.
- Games...

117
00:04:03,275 --> 00:04:04,344
- Right.
- Okay.

118
00:04:04,345 --> 00:04:05,804
- We'll do our best.
- Yes.

119
00:04:05,805 --> 00:04:08,575
Si Ah, you've never been on other variety shows?

120
00:04:08,945 --> 00:04:10,415
- I was...
- Yes.

121
00:04:10,815 --> 00:04:13,184
- on "Country Cook."
- Yes.

122
00:04:13,185 --> 00:04:16,014
I filmed it with Chef Edward Lee and Byun Yo Han.

123
00:04:16,015 --> 00:04:17,484
Oh, right.

124
00:04:17,485 --> 00:04:18,725
I think I've seen the show.

125
00:04:19,725 --> 00:04:21,325
(Suspecting him)

126
00:04:21,425 --> 00:04:22,895
(Chuckling)

127
00:04:24,125 --> 00:04:26,495
- She's good at catching your lie.
- I... All right.

128
00:04:26,595 --> 00:04:28,234
When I said I had seen it,

129
00:04:28,235 --> 00:04:30,265
I didn't mean I watched it from start to finish.

130
00:04:30,635 --> 00:04:31,805
Right.

131
00:04:33,005 --> 00:04:35,474
- Yes. I was so nervous.
- Okay.

132
00:04:35,475 --> 00:04:36,504
- Really?
- Yes.

133
00:04:36,505 --> 00:04:37,604
She's been nervous since yesterday.

134
00:04:37,605 --> 00:04:38,875
Why are you so nervous?

135
00:04:39,105 --> 00:04:40,475
Well,

136
00:04:41,015 --> 00:04:43,475
I've only seen you on the telly.

137
00:04:43,845 --> 00:04:44,944
- I'm meeting you...
- You know what?

138
00:04:44,945 --> 00:04:46,144
- for the first time after my debut.
- She feels approachable.

139
00:04:46,145 --> 00:04:48,884
She said, "telly." That makes her approachable.

140
00:04:48,885 --> 00:04:51,084
So out of everything I filmed so far,

141
00:04:51,085 --> 00:04:52,855
I'm the most nervous for this one.

142
00:04:53,755 --> 00:04:54,755
Really?

143
00:04:54,756 --> 00:04:55,794
(She doesn't know what to do with Jae Suk in front of her.)

144
00:04:55,795 --> 00:04:57,094
So listen.

145
00:04:57,095 --> 00:04:59,624
- We'll meet some people later.
- Yes.

146
00:04:59,625 --> 00:05:01,564
We have to try out the games to give them presents.

147
00:05:01,565 --> 00:05:03,464
- Yes.
- You have to focus during games.

148
00:05:03,465 --> 00:05:04,634
- Right.
- Right?

149
00:05:04,635 --> 00:05:05,904
I'm totally ready.

150
00:05:05,905 --> 00:05:07,075
- Really?
- Yes.

151
00:05:07,175 --> 00:05:09,104
- Are you good at games?
- Well,

152
00:05:09,105 --> 00:05:11,174
- I've been practicing some games.
- Are you good at games?

153
00:05:11,175 --> 00:05:12,744
- You practiced?
- What did you do?

154
00:05:12,745 --> 00:05:15,174
- I watched your show.
- Okay.

155
00:05:15,175 --> 00:05:17,084
- After watching the show, - Okay.

156
00:05:17,085 --> 00:05:19,015
I tried to work on my agility.

157
00:05:19,145 --> 00:05:20,754
You trained your agility?

158
00:05:20,755 --> 00:05:22,284
- I trained some skills.
- You did?

159
00:05:22,285 --> 00:05:23,654
- How did you train them?
- I tried out the games.

160
00:05:23,655 --> 00:05:25,024
The one with the erasers.

161
00:05:25,025 --> 00:05:26,601
(They've never met a Whenever Friend like her.)

162
00:05:26,625 --> 00:05:28,794
- I tried to sharpen my senses.
- Right. You need to do that.

163
00:05:28,795 --> 00:05:30,155
Are you good at games, Young Woo?

164
00:05:30,465 --> 00:05:31,924
I'm good at physical games.

165
00:05:31,925 --> 00:05:33,224
- Do you like those games?
- I like physical games.

166
00:05:33,225 --> 00:05:34,334
- Really?
- Yes.

167
00:05:34,335 --> 00:05:37,064
Between the upper and lower bodies, which are you more comfortable with?

168
00:05:37,065 --> 00:05:38,434
- The upper body.
- Your upper body is good?

169
00:05:38,435 --> 00:05:40,165
Yes. Like table tennis.

170
00:05:40,675 --> 00:05:41,874
- I'm good at that too.
- I'm good...

171
00:05:41,875 --> 00:05:44,545
- at throwing or hitting balls.
- Are you good at that?

172
00:05:44,805 --> 00:05:46,374
- He's not good with his feet.
- Really?

173
00:05:46,375 --> 00:05:47,514
But aren't you good at that?

174
00:05:47,515 --> 00:05:50,315
- I've hit a slump lately.
- Aren't you good, though?

175
00:05:50,745 --> 00:05:52,045
Things aren't looking good now.

176
00:05:52,245 --> 00:05:53,614
- I...
- Is it because of the pressure?

177
00:05:53,615 --> 00:05:54,815
- Pardon?
- The pressure...

178
00:05:54,985 --> 00:05:56,754
- Yes. He gets nervous.
- Right.

179
00:05:56,755 --> 00:05:58,724
He gets nervous for no reason.

180
00:05:58,725 --> 00:05:59,725
- That's right.
- Yes.

181
00:05:59,726 --> 00:06:01,055
How did you know that, Si Ah?

182
00:06:01,155 --> 00:06:03,255
I've been watching you.

183
00:06:03,525 --> 00:06:06,165
It seems pressure always gets to you...

184
00:06:06,325 --> 00:06:07,965
- when you play games.
- That's true.

185
00:06:08,135 --> 00:06:09,665
I don't perform well at big games.

186
00:06:09,865 --> 00:06:11,264
- I'm just like that too.
- Really?

187
00:06:11,265 --> 00:06:13,804
Yes. I'm so good when I'm practicing.

188
00:06:13,805 --> 00:06:14,904
But when I have to play for real,

189
00:06:14,905 --> 00:06:16,351
- I can't perform well.
- I'm like that too.

190
00:06:16,375 --> 00:06:18,244
- What should we do then?
- What?

191
00:06:18,245 --> 00:06:19,474
Right. Exactly.

192
00:06:19,475 --> 00:06:20,844
- Other people must do well.
- I see.

193
00:06:20,845 --> 00:06:22,445
Or we'll be doomed. It's 1 of these 2.

194
00:06:22,875 --> 00:06:24,415
(Oh, I see!)

195
00:06:24,885 --> 00:06:26,015
- I'll do my best.
- Okay.

196
00:06:26,485 --> 00:06:29,454
- You guys filmed a movie together.
- Yes.

197
00:06:29,455 --> 00:06:30,485
Tell us about the movie.

198
00:06:30,685 --> 00:06:32,425
- The title is quite long.
- What is it?

199
00:06:32,525 --> 00:06:34,595
"Even If This Love Disappears..."

200
00:06:34,695 --> 00:06:37,064
"from the World Tonight."

201
00:06:37,065 --> 00:06:40,995
"Even If Love Disappears from This World..."

202
00:06:41,095 --> 00:06:42,834
- "This Love."
- "This Love."

203
00:06:42,835 --> 00:06:44,164
- "Even If..."
- "Even If..."

204
00:06:44,165 --> 00:06:45,504
"This Love Disappears from the World Tonight."

205
00:06:45,505 --> 00:06:47,774
People usually shorten long titles.

206
00:06:47,775 --> 00:06:48,834
"ELDWT."

207
00:06:48,835 --> 00:06:50,575
"ELDWT." Wait.

208
00:06:51,245 --> 00:06:52,705
- "ELDWT."
- Gosh.

209
00:06:52,775 --> 00:06:54,775
- "ELDWT."
- Wait.

210
00:06:55,145 --> 00:06:57,214
- That's it.
- It reminds me of Seok Jin.

211
00:06:57,215 --> 00:06:58,884
- "ELDWT."
- "ELDWT."

212
00:06:58,885 --> 00:07:00,515
I thought it meant PG-5.

213
00:07:01,255 --> 00:07:04,054
Doesn't your character lose her memory, Si Ah?

214
00:07:04,055 --> 00:07:06,585
Yes. My character has anterograde amnesia.

215
00:07:06,925 --> 00:07:07,925
(Chuckling)

216
00:07:07,926 --> 00:07:09,125
- Why...
- Okay.

217
00:07:09,925 --> 00:07:10,965
Why...

218
00:07:11,395 --> 00:07:12,425
Is that funny?

219
00:07:12,495 --> 00:07:14,365
- I'm sorry.
- It's okay.

220
00:07:14,595 --> 00:07:16,665
- It's natural.
- Yes, it's natural.

221
00:07:17,865 --> 00:07:20,305
People do laugh when they see me from time to time.

222
00:07:20,835 --> 00:07:22,775
It's all right, Si Ah.

223
00:07:23,035 --> 00:07:24,844
So once her day is over,

224
00:07:24,845 --> 00:07:26,781
- she loses her memory of the day.
- Your character loses her memory.

225
00:07:26,805 --> 00:07:29,165
- She loses her memory of that day.
- You lose your memory.

226
00:07:29,545 --> 00:07:30,885
She loses her memory of that day?

227
00:07:31,115 --> 00:07:32,984
- Yes.
- It seems she has amnesia even now.

228
00:07:32,985 --> 00:07:34,014
- Seeing your face...
- I...

229
00:07:34,015 --> 00:07:36,315
- I might lose my memory now.
- Really?

230
00:07:37,285 --> 00:07:41,025
(A teen romantic movie with Choo Young Woo and Shin Si Ah)

231
00:07:41,095 --> 00:07:42,371
(Do you want to go out with me?)

232
00:07:42,395 --> 00:07:43,395
(Sure.)

233
00:07:43,395 --> 00:07:44,395
(What?)

234
00:07:45,595 --> 00:07:46,595
(I'm...)

235
00:07:47,095 --> 00:07:48,464
(Jae Won.)

236
00:07:48,465 --> 00:07:49,534
(I'm Kim Jae Won.)

237
00:07:49,535 --> 00:07:50,965
(I don't know you.)

238
00:07:51,705 --> 00:07:53,104
(A heartfelt love story of high school students)

239
00:07:53,105 --> 00:07:54,785
My character tries his best to help her...

240
00:07:54,835 --> 00:07:56,204
- Help her remember?
- Yes.

241
00:07:56,205 --> 00:07:57,905
It's fun to watch the process.

242
00:07:58,275 --> 00:08:02,144
Our movie features a story about memories.

243
00:08:02,145 --> 00:08:04,214
Everyone holds onto...

244
00:08:04,215 --> 00:08:05,584
- their own precious memories.
- That's right.

245
00:08:05,585 --> 00:08:08,015
Because we take these memories for granted...

246
00:08:08,315 --> 00:08:09,385
What is it?

247
00:08:10,785 --> 00:08:12,885
I was just smiling at you.

248
00:08:13,385 --> 00:08:15,595
I was just smiling at you. Keep going.

249
00:08:15,625 --> 00:08:17,494
Everyone holds onto their own precious memories.

250
00:08:17,495 --> 00:08:18,495
But we sometimes forget...

251
00:08:18,496 --> 00:08:19,524
- how valuable they are.
- Right.

252
00:08:19,525 --> 00:08:22,565
So this movie helps you appreciate each day you have.

253
00:08:23,035 --> 00:08:25,334
- That's what your movie is about.
- Yes. That's spot on.

254
00:08:25,335 --> 00:08:26,364
Great.

255
00:08:26,365 --> 00:08:28,134
I can't remember the title now.

256
00:08:28,135 --> 00:08:30,574
But it was a Japanese romantic movie.

257
00:08:30,575 --> 00:08:32,904
Their memories were...

258
00:08:32,905 --> 00:08:34,875
- "My Tomorrow,"
- That's the one.

259
00:08:34,975 --> 00:08:36,844
"Your Yesterday?"

260
00:08:36,845 --> 00:08:37,884
- It's that one.
- Yes.

261
00:08:37,885 --> 00:08:39,584
- The one in the subway?
- That was long too.

262
00:08:39,585 --> 00:08:40,654
- Yes.
- I watched it too.

263
00:08:40,655 --> 00:08:41,714
- You did?
- Yes.

264
00:08:41,715 --> 00:08:43,255
I like this kind of movie.

265
00:08:43,415 --> 00:08:44,454
Have you watched that one?

266
00:08:44,455 --> 00:08:46,135
- I haven't. But...
- Then stay out of it.

267
00:08:48,325 --> 00:08:51,064
- I starred in a similar movie.
- Stay out of it.

268
00:08:51,065 --> 00:08:53,001
- "The Beauty Inside" is also...
- Stay out of it.

269
00:08:53,025 --> 00:08:55,134
- Right.
- Stay out of it. The three of us...

270
00:08:55,135 --> 00:08:57,934
- The movie is about memories too.
- The three of us will talk.

271
00:08:57,935 --> 00:08:58,935
(Watching them bicker and fight)

272
00:08:58,936 --> 00:09:00,605
We should talk about the movie.

273
00:09:01,575 --> 00:09:02,575
When will it be released?

274
00:09:02,775 --> 00:09:05,304
- It will come out on December 24.
- What?

275
00:09:05,305 --> 00:09:06,544
- We're filming...
- Today's episode...

276
00:09:06,545 --> 00:09:07,545
the Christmas special.

277
00:09:08,145 --> 00:09:09,444
It will come out on the day after our episode airs.

278
00:09:09,445 --> 00:09:10,785
- Right.
- I see.

279
00:09:10,985 --> 00:09:12,714
Did you set up a tree at home?

280
00:09:12,715 --> 00:09:14,795
- A Christmas tree?
- I got a pop-up Christmas tree.

281
00:09:15,115 --> 00:09:16,414
- What's that?
- A pop-up tree?

282
00:09:16,415 --> 00:09:18,855
- It unfolds right away.
- There's a pop-up Christmas tree.

283
00:09:19,385 --> 00:09:21,594
- It has ornaments and lights too.
- It comes with everything.

284
00:09:21,595 --> 00:09:23,394
- It comes with ornaments?
- So...

285
00:09:23,395 --> 00:09:25,864
- Yes.
- Same here. I set up my tree early.

286
00:09:25,865 --> 00:09:27,694
- When do you set it up?
- In November.

287
00:09:27,695 --> 00:09:29,364
- I see.
- November? Yes.

288
00:09:29,365 --> 00:09:31,365
- I do it on December 1. Yes.
- December 1?

289
00:09:31,505 --> 00:09:33,934
- Say you set up a Christmas tree.
- Okay.

290
00:09:33,935 --> 00:09:37,305
When should you take down the tree?

291
00:09:37,575 --> 00:09:39,145
Until moms tell you to get rid of it.

292
00:09:40,545 --> 00:09:41,774
(A clear solution)

293
00:09:41,775 --> 00:09:43,445
You should keep it.

294
00:09:43,575 --> 00:09:45,014
Until moms tell you...

295
00:09:45,015 --> 00:09:46,015
- to take it down.
- "Take it down now."

296
00:09:46,016 --> 00:09:47,856
(She solves the Christmas problem right away.)

297
00:09:48,585 --> 00:09:50,584
Look at the time. We were so busy talking.

298
00:09:50,585 --> 00:09:51,724
We must hurry.

299
00:09:51,725 --> 00:09:54,825
For our Christmas special, we're meeting Choi Hyeok Ryang.

300
00:09:55,795 --> 00:09:56,995
Hyeok Ryang.

301
00:09:57,095 --> 00:09:59,065
"'Watch. This is the battle of the girls.'"

302
00:09:59,995 --> 00:10:04,005
"Rookies of 2 months of experience and veterans of 18 years..."

303
00:10:04,165 --> 00:10:06,364
"are sweating buckets even in winter..."

304
00:10:06,365 --> 00:10:08,575
"to learn the news songs."

305
00:10:08,875 --> 00:10:10,004
(Surprised)

306
00:10:10,005 --> 00:10:11,444
"We're doing..."

307
00:10:11,445 --> 00:10:14,244
"reels challenges while waiting for our debut."

308
00:10:14,245 --> 00:10:16,074
- They must be singers.
- "Would you like to join us..."

309
00:10:16,075 --> 00:10:17,684
"for the Mega Crew Stage?"

310
00:10:17,685 --> 00:10:19,915
- They must be a dance crew. Right?
- I see.

311
00:10:20,415 --> 00:10:23,155
They film a lot of videos. They must be a dance crew.

312
00:10:23,555 --> 00:10:25,084
- Gosh.
- They must be a dance crew.

313
00:10:25,085 --> 00:10:27,325
- Shall we get going?
- Let's go.

314
00:10:27,855 --> 00:10:28,855
Young Woo graduated from...

315
00:10:28,855 --> 00:10:29,855
- Korea National University of Arts.
- Korea National University of Arts?

316
00:10:29,856 --> 00:10:31,424
- That's right.
- He can be our guide...

317
00:10:31,425 --> 00:10:32,564
in Seokgwan-dong.

318
00:10:32,565 --> 00:10:34,994
- Sure. I'll do my best.
- Do you know any good restaurants?

319
00:10:34,995 --> 00:10:36,834
I bet we're meeting a dance crew.

320
00:10:36,835 --> 00:10:38,005
- A dance crew.
- Yes.

321
00:10:38,265 --> 00:10:40,434
Wait. I think you danced at your fan-meet,

322
00:10:40,435 --> 00:10:42,505
and it went viral.

323
00:10:42,705 --> 00:10:45,004
- It went viral.
- I didn't see it.

324
00:10:45,005 --> 00:10:46,675
It did go viral.

325
00:10:46,805 --> 00:10:48,975
- He worked hard on it.
- I did my best.

326
00:10:49,215 --> 00:10:50,915
- I should watch it.
- No.

327
00:10:51,415 --> 00:10:53,114
"Choo Young Woo in a tank top." It came up right away.

328
00:10:53,115 --> 00:10:55,214
No. Please. Don't watch it.

329
00:10:55,215 --> 00:10:56,454
My gosh, no.

330
00:10:56,455 --> 00:10:57,924
- He's a good dancer.
- Gosh, no.

331
00:10:57,925 --> 00:10:59,855
- Gosh. Wait, Jae Suk.
- He's good.

332
00:11:00,025 --> 00:11:01,725
- Gosh. No!
- He's a good dancer.

333
00:11:01,825 --> 00:11:03,094
- Gosh, look.
- He's good.

334
00:11:03,095 --> 00:11:05,255
(Young Woo's dance grabs their attention immediately.)

335
00:11:07,635 --> 00:11:10,965
(The dancer in a tank top gives it his all for his fans.)

336
00:11:11,635 --> 00:11:13,134
(Cracking up at his passion)

337
00:11:13,135 --> 00:11:15,075
- We don't have much time left.
- By the way...

338
00:11:15,805 --> 00:11:17,805
- You're a good dancer.
- Do you...

339
00:11:18,475 --> 00:11:20,121
- But you didn't look like a pro.
- Right.

340
00:11:20,145 --> 00:11:22,674
- We don't have much time left.
- Let's get going.

341
00:11:22,675 --> 00:11:23,995
(His dance leaves an impression.)

342
00:11:24,515 --> 00:11:26,784
- Aren't you cold?
- No, I'm not. Are you cold?

343
00:11:26,785 --> 00:11:27,915
- Are you okay?
- I'm okay.

344
00:11:28,955 --> 00:11:31,124
- Wait. She's older than you?
- She's a year older than me.

345
00:11:31,125 --> 00:11:32,184
- By a year?
- Really?

346
00:11:32,185 --> 00:11:34,105
- What year were you born?
- I was born in 1998.

347
00:11:34,395 --> 00:11:35,454
- I was born in 1999.
- Gosh.

348
00:11:35,455 --> 00:11:36,854
- In 1998 and 1999.
- You were born in 1998.

349
00:11:36,855 --> 00:11:38,325
I didn't know.

350
00:11:38,565 --> 00:11:40,295
I thought she was born in the early 2000s.

351
00:11:40,465 --> 00:11:42,235
- Really?
- Are you happy?

352
00:11:43,435 --> 00:11:44,435
- Are you happy?
- Yes.

353
00:11:44,436 --> 00:11:46,435
This kind of compliment makes me happy.

354
00:11:47,775 --> 00:11:50,305
It's not a big compliment. She was born in 1998.

355
00:11:50,475 --> 00:11:51,844
But I said she looked like she was born in the early 2000s.

356
00:11:51,845 --> 00:11:53,404
- So she's happy.
- Yes.

357
00:11:53,405 --> 00:11:54,445
Right.

358
00:11:55,075 --> 00:11:56,491
Korea National University of Arts is here.

359
00:11:56,515 --> 00:11:58,514
I can see it from here.

360
00:11:58,515 --> 00:12:00,185
- Come here.
- It's so close from here.

361
00:12:00,545 --> 00:12:01,954
- Right.
- Yes.

362
00:12:01,955 --> 00:12:03,161
(They're passing by the university.)

363
00:12:03,185 --> 00:12:04,584
You must've come here often then.

364
00:12:04,585 --> 00:12:07,325
There were some good restaurants...

365
00:12:07,495 --> 00:12:09,025
around the back gate.

366
00:12:09,555 --> 00:12:11,795
What did you usually get around here?

367
00:12:12,265 --> 00:12:15,165
Around here, I usually got Vietnamese food.

368
00:12:15,335 --> 00:12:17,095
- Or sushi.
- Vietnamese food sounds good.

369
00:12:17,265 --> 00:12:18,745
- Do you like Vietnamese food?
- Yes.

370
00:12:18,805 --> 00:12:20,365
What kind of food do you like?

371
00:12:20,505 --> 00:12:22,574
- Food? I like food in general.
- Yes.

372
00:12:22,575 --> 00:12:25,674
But my favorite food is pork belly.

373
00:12:25,675 --> 00:12:27,715
And I also like sushi.

374
00:12:27,975 --> 00:12:30,245
But the food I can eat the most is ramyeon.

375
00:12:31,015 --> 00:12:32,314
It's hard to find it under ten dollars.

376
00:12:32,315 --> 00:12:34,355
That's amazing. Ramyeon...

377
00:12:35,385 --> 00:12:37,984
I bet this restaurant was good too. The one right here.

378
00:12:37,985 --> 00:12:39,125
It's good.

379
00:12:39,455 --> 00:12:41,154
- They serve homey food.
- I see.

380
00:12:41,155 --> 00:12:42,995
- That's a bindaetteok restaurant.
- That one?

381
00:12:43,395 --> 00:12:44,671
It's called Oohlala Bindaetteok.

382
00:12:44,695 --> 00:12:46,225
- You've been there.
- Yes.

383
00:12:46,725 --> 00:12:48,864
You see this a lot...

384
00:12:48,865 --> 00:12:50,611
- on streets with young people.
- Around college campuses.

385
00:12:50,635 --> 00:12:52,664
People scribble some things on the wall like this.

386
00:12:52,665 --> 00:12:54,604
- They sign their names.
- I'm sure my name is somewhere.

387
00:12:54,605 --> 00:12:55,704
- I see.
- Really?

388
00:12:55,705 --> 00:12:57,374
- Did you sign the wall?
- Yes.

389
00:12:57,375 --> 00:12:59,305
I should look for your name.

390
00:13:00,205 --> 00:13:01,874
(As they follow the GPS...)

391
00:13:01,875 --> 00:13:03,745
It's inside the apartment complex.

392
00:13:04,115 --> 00:13:05,485
But inside the complex?

393
00:13:06,015 --> 00:13:07,955
Are we going into the apartment complex?

394
00:13:08,115 --> 00:13:09,815
- So...
- I got it. Community center?

395
00:13:10,255 --> 00:13:13,384
- Right. Inside the complex...
- Could it be that?

396
00:13:13,385 --> 00:13:15,324
- Even if it's not a dance crew...
- A dance club?

397
00:13:15,325 --> 00:13:16,895
- A club?
- A club.

398
00:13:17,625 --> 00:13:19,595
- Seriously.
- Gosh, look.

399
00:13:19,925 --> 00:13:20,995
What's this?

400
00:13:21,335 --> 00:13:22,965
- Pork belly barbecue. Hello.
- My gosh.

401
00:13:23,165 --> 00:13:24,334
- Hello.
- Sir.

402
00:13:24,335 --> 00:13:25,964
- Gosh, look at that.
- This looks so good.

403
00:13:25,965 --> 00:13:28,435
- We talked about pork belly.
- Yes.

404
00:13:28,775 --> 00:13:31,505
- Si Ah said she liked...
- Oh, my. It's the whole slab.

405
00:13:31,845 --> 00:13:34,314
- I only saw tteokgalbi.
- Take some home.

406
00:13:34,315 --> 00:13:36,374
Look at this. YouTubers from food channels...

407
00:13:36,375 --> 00:13:38,415
- That looks good.
- would eat from the whole slab.

408
00:13:38,715 --> 00:13:39,744
I bet it's so juicy.

409
00:13:39,745 --> 00:13:41,355
Gosh, this is crazy.

410
00:13:41,985 --> 00:13:43,185
Should we have this for lunch?

411
00:13:44,585 --> 00:13:45,585
Sounds good.

412
00:13:45,586 --> 00:13:47,894
- How long does it take?
- It will be ready at 10:30am.

413
00:13:47,895 --> 00:13:49,054
At 10:30am?

414
00:13:49,055 --> 00:13:50,724
(Unfortunately, it will be ready in 40 minutes.)

415
00:13:50,725 --> 00:13:52,194
- Si Ah, let it go.
- Have a good day.

416
00:13:52,195 --> 00:13:53,265
Have a good day.

417
00:13:53,395 --> 00:13:55,134
- If all goes well, - After the games...

418
00:13:55,135 --> 00:13:56,334
we might be able to eat that...

419
00:13:56,335 --> 00:13:57,364
- after the game.
- Right.

420
00:13:57,365 --> 00:13:59,065
- Bye.
- Right.

421
00:13:59,505 --> 00:14:01,065
- Gosh.
- We might be able to eat it...

422
00:14:01,135 --> 00:14:02,974
- after the game.
- That's a lot of food.

423
00:14:02,975 --> 00:14:04,504
The pork belly is the only thing...

424
00:14:04,505 --> 00:14:06,205
- I can think of.
- Right.

425
00:14:06,405 --> 00:14:07,774
Pick one between tteokgalbi...

426
00:14:07,775 --> 00:14:09,544
and pork belly. One, two, three.

427
00:14:09,545 --> 00:14:11,014
- Pork belly.
- Me too.

428
00:14:11,015 --> 00:14:12,044
- Really?
- Yes.

429
00:14:12,045 --> 00:14:14,445
- I'd like to try tteokgalbi too.
- Only I chose tteokgalbi.

430
00:14:14,585 --> 00:14:17,114
I think you need to eat with rice.

431
00:14:17,115 --> 00:14:18,354
- The seasoning must be strong.
- I see.

432
00:14:18,355 --> 00:14:19,654
- The seasoning might be strong?
- Yes.

433
00:14:19,655 --> 00:14:21,824
Do you have breakfast usually?

434
00:14:21,825 --> 00:14:24,264
- Sometimes, I eat tripe.
- Bacon?

435
00:14:24,265 --> 00:14:27,024
- For breakfast?
- I tend to have a big breakfast.

436
00:14:27,025 --> 00:14:29,394
- You eat tripe for breakfast?
- Really?

437
00:14:29,395 --> 00:14:31,064
- Really?
- Where do you get tripe?

438
00:14:31,065 --> 00:14:32,934
There are restaurants that open...

439
00:14:32,935 --> 00:14:34,374
- at 6am and 7am.
- Okay.

440
00:14:34,375 --> 00:14:36,635
- I sometimes have beef tripe there.
- Really?

441
00:14:36,905 --> 00:14:39,474
- Tripe as soon as you wake up?
- At 6am?

442
00:14:39,475 --> 00:14:41,544
- Time doesn't really affect me.
- Gosh.

443
00:14:41,545 --> 00:14:42,844
- I've never seen anyone like her.
- That's crazy.

444
00:14:42,845 --> 00:14:44,684
- No way. It's ㅁ late-night snack.
- You know what?

445
00:14:44,685 --> 00:14:46,414
Some people digest meat well.

446
00:14:46,415 --> 00:14:47,955
- Right.
- Totally.

447
00:14:48,185 --> 00:14:49,314
Do you eat breakfast, Young Woo?

448
00:14:49,315 --> 00:14:52,954
- I often eat cakes for breakfast.
- Cakes?

449
00:14:52,955 --> 00:14:53,984
Cakes for breakfast?

450
00:14:53,985 --> 00:14:55,271
- For breakfast?
- They're both so young.

451
00:14:55,295 --> 00:14:56,731
- They're so young.
- Cakes for breakfast?

452
00:14:56,755 --> 00:14:58,895
- That's...
- You'd wrap it with silver foil.

453
00:14:58,995 --> 00:15:01,464
- You have it for breakfast?
- Isn't it good the next day?

454
00:15:01,465 --> 00:15:02,564
Hello.

455
00:15:02,565 --> 00:15:03,694
- The next day?
- Hello.

456
00:15:03,695 --> 00:15:05,034
- Hello.
- Hello.

457
00:15:05,035 --> 00:15:06,035
(They enter an apartment complex as they chat.)

458
00:15:06,036 --> 00:15:08,904
Hold on. It's between Buildings 110 and 111.

459
00:15:08,905 --> 00:15:09,905
Building 106.

460
00:15:09,975 --> 00:15:13,675
- There are community centers.
- So... Right. Probably.

461
00:15:14,175 --> 00:15:16,014
- Where is it?
- That's Building 110.

462
00:15:16,015 --> 00:15:18,084
I see Buildings 109 and 110.

463
00:15:18,085 --> 00:15:20,244
- Building 111. Building 107.
- Gosh.

464
00:15:20,245 --> 00:15:21,515
That must be Building 107.

465
00:15:22,015 --> 00:15:24,114
It's over there. I see a building.

466
00:15:24,115 --> 00:15:26,454
It says, "fitness" and "yoga."

467
00:15:26,455 --> 00:15:28,494
- Diet dance?
- I see.

468
00:15:28,495 --> 00:15:30,525
- It's diet dance.
- Diet dance.

469
00:15:31,225 --> 00:15:32,395
Diet dance.

470
00:15:32,725 --> 00:15:34,734
It must be the fitness center.

471
00:15:34,735 --> 00:15:35,764
(The mega crew is here?)

472
00:15:35,765 --> 00:15:38,735
We must find Choi Hyeok Ryang.

473
00:15:39,265 --> 00:15:41,545
- You can already hear the music.
- The music is playing.

474
00:15:42,005 --> 00:15:44,275
(Shouting)

475
00:15:44,805 --> 00:15:45,844
- This is it.
- To the middle.

476
00:15:45,845 --> 00:15:48,014
- I can already...
- They're dancing as a group.

477
00:15:48,015 --> 00:15:49,621
- We came to the right place.
- For the show...

478
00:15:49,645 --> 00:15:50,885
- Power dance.
- So...

479
00:15:51,085 --> 00:15:52,215
"Aerobics Studio."

480
00:15:52,615 --> 00:15:55,855
- They're already dancing here.
- This is...

481
00:15:56,115 --> 00:15:57,315
This feels...

482
00:15:57,585 --> 00:15:59,354
(They muster up the courage and enter.)

483
00:15:59,355 --> 00:16:01,925
Gosh. Hello.

484
00:16:02,795 --> 00:16:04,095
My goodness.

485
00:16:05,165 --> 00:16:06,965
(Hello!)

486
00:16:07,965 --> 00:16:10,564
(Surprised by the biggest welcome ever)

487
00:16:10,565 --> 00:16:11,635
My gosh. Okay.

488
00:16:14,105 --> 00:16:17,335
(Would you like to join us for the Mega Crew Stage?)

489
00:16:17,845 --> 00:16:20,004
- It's as expected.
- They're so pumped up.

490
00:16:20,005 --> 00:16:21,375
(Overwhelmed by their vibe)

491
00:16:23,215 --> 00:16:25,814
(The aerobics mega crew...)

492
00:16:25,815 --> 00:16:28,555
(shakes up the whole apartment complex.)

493
00:16:30,885 --> 00:16:33,425
(They've never seen anything like this before.)

494
00:16:38,765 --> 00:16:42,535
(As they exude their dance energy to the fullest...)

495
00:16:42,995 --> 00:16:44,704
What? The AC is on.

496
00:16:44,705 --> 00:16:46,064
(The AC is on full blast even in winter.)

497
00:16:46,065 --> 00:16:47,105
The air conditioner is on.

498
00:16:51,575 --> 00:16:52,975
- Join us.
- Let's go.

499
00:16:59,645 --> 00:17:01,415
(Swarming over)

500
00:17:03,815 --> 00:17:07,555
(Watching the performance up close)

501
00:17:12,525 --> 00:17:15,365
(A performance for a heartwarming welcome)

502
00:17:19,635 --> 00:17:22,804
(Cheering)

503
00:17:22,805 --> 00:17:24,175
My gosh. Oh, my.

504
00:17:24,775 --> 00:17:26,274
(The tank top dancer shows his respect too.)

505
00:17:26,275 --> 00:17:27,615
- Gosh.
- My goodness.

506
00:17:27,715 --> 00:17:29,575
Great job.

507
00:17:30,115 --> 00:17:31,815
- That was great.
- Hello.

508
00:17:32,445 --> 00:17:35,414
Where's Choi Hyeok Ryang?

509
00:17:35,415 --> 00:17:36,415
(Where's our Whenever Guest?)

510
00:17:36,416 --> 00:17:37,584
(She's right here.)

511
00:17:37,585 --> 00:17:38,585
Hello.

512
00:17:38,586 --> 00:17:39,954
- Hello.
- You're the one who wrote to us.

513
00:17:39,955 --> 00:17:40,955
(First Whenever Guest: Choi Hyeok Ryang)

514
00:17:40,956 --> 00:17:43,024
- This is Si Ah. This is Young Woo.
- Hello.

515
00:17:43,025 --> 00:17:44,864
- Yeon Seok is here too.
- Hello.

516
00:17:44,865 --> 00:17:46,194
It's midwinter.

517
00:17:46,195 --> 00:17:49,665
- Gosh, they're all sweating.
- They have the AC on.

518
00:17:50,295 --> 00:17:51,564
The air conditioner is on.

519
00:17:51,565 --> 00:17:53,765
- The heat in here is crazy.
- Yes.

520
00:17:53,835 --> 00:17:56,574
First of all, nice to meet you. Hello.

521
00:17:56,575 --> 00:17:57,974
- Hello.
- Hello.

522
00:17:57,975 --> 00:17:59,444
(The Whenever Guest and classmates from her diet dance class)

523
00:17:59,445 --> 00:18:02,044
So it's a community center within the complex, right?

524
00:18:02,045 --> 00:18:04,744
- Yes.
- Then you must all live here.

525
00:18:04,745 --> 00:18:05,784
- Yes.
- Right.

526
00:18:05,785 --> 00:18:06,814
(They all live in the same apartment complex.)

527
00:18:06,815 --> 00:18:08,135
Does your dance crew have a name?

528
00:18:08,655 --> 00:18:11,184
It's Pyo Teacher Dance.

529
00:18:11,185 --> 00:18:12,885
- Pyo Teacher Dance.
- We're her students.

530
00:18:13,055 --> 00:18:14,225
- Are you the teacher?
- Yes.

531
00:18:15,025 --> 00:18:16,624
How long have you been teaching here?

532
00:18:16,625 --> 00:18:19,464
- It will be my 19th year next year.
- What?

533
00:18:19,465 --> 00:18:21,971
(It will be her 19th year teaching in the apartment complex next year.)

534
00:18:21,995 --> 00:18:24,034
- I've been here a long time.
- Then are you...

535
00:18:24,035 --> 00:18:26,804
the first dance instructor this center ever had?

536
00:18:26,805 --> 00:18:29,105
I had been teaching ever since this center was set up.

537
00:18:29,835 --> 00:18:31,704
She was also here...

538
00:18:31,705 --> 00:18:33,104
- when I started teaching here.
- Okay.

539
00:18:33,105 --> 00:18:36,315
The rest of them have been here for 11 or 15 years.

540
00:18:36,715 --> 00:18:37,844
- Everyone's been here...
- That's a long time.

541
00:18:37,845 --> 00:18:38,914
For a long time.

542
00:18:38,915 --> 00:18:40,644
- Gosh.
- I gave her the nickname.

543
00:18:40,645 --> 00:18:41,814
- What is it?
- Archaeopteryx.

544
00:18:41,815 --> 00:18:43,714
(Archaeopteryx)

545
00:18:43,715 --> 00:18:45,424
- She's been here the longest?
- Yes.

546
00:18:45,425 --> 00:18:48,095
Ancestor. Archaeopteryx. I gave her only the good nicknames.

547
00:18:48,695 --> 00:18:50,494
How many years has it been for you?

548
00:18:50,495 --> 00:18:51,865
It's been 12 years.

549
00:18:52,195 --> 00:18:54,895
- So 12 years and 18 years.
- Yes.

550
00:18:55,165 --> 00:18:56,835
- Eleven years.
- Eleven years.

551
00:18:56,995 --> 00:18:58,704
- Fifteen years.
- Fifteen years.

552
00:18:58,705 --> 00:19:00,764
- Ten years for me.
- Gosh.

553
00:19:00,765 --> 00:19:02,705
- It's all been a decade for you.
- Yes.

554
00:19:03,405 --> 00:19:06,104
Then how long has it been for the rookie?

555
00:19:06,105 --> 00:19:08,414
- It's the one in yellow pants.
- It's been two months.

556
00:19:08,415 --> 00:19:09,514
- Two months?
- Wait.

557
00:19:09,515 --> 00:19:11,475
You've been here for two months. How is it going?

558
00:19:11,715 --> 00:19:13,285
Good. It's fun.

559
00:19:14,455 --> 00:19:15,885
You seem a bit intimidated.

560
00:19:16,455 --> 00:19:18,654
I mentioned that for a reason.

561
00:19:18,655 --> 00:19:20,424
Some members have been at the center...

562
00:19:20,425 --> 00:19:21,454
almost as long as the center.

563
00:19:21,455 --> 00:19:23,824
- Right.
- Was it hard fitting in?

564
00:19:23,825 --> 00:19:25,595
Well, no. It wasn't hard.

565
00:19:27,025 --> 00:19:28,534
Why do you sound so scared?

566
00:19:28,535 --> 00:19:29,834
You just glanced at the lady...

567
00:19:29,835 --> 00:19:31,534
- in front of you.
- You meant that, right?

568
00:19:31,535 --> 00:19:32,664
(The old members keep a close tab on her.)

569
00:19:32,665 --> 00:19:33,734
That was...

570
00:19:33,735 --> 00:19:36,904
I heard that it also affected their spot in the formation.

571
00:19:36,905 --> 00:19:39,844
Members who have been here longer get to stand in the front, right?

572
00:19:39,845 --> 00:19:41,144
Members who have been here over a decade...

573
00:19:41,145 --> 00:19:42,314
- get to stand in the front.
- Right.

574
00:19:42,315 --> 00:19:44,115
- We hold an audition.
- Based on the skills.

575
00:19:44,485 --> 00:19:46,244
- What audition?
- For the front row?

576
00:19:46,245 --> 00:19:47,644
- For the front row.
- I see.

577
00:19:47,645 --> 00:19:49,854
Like how idols compete for the center position.

578
00:19:49,855 --> 00:19:51,331
(It's similar to how idols compete for the center position.)

579
00:19:51,355 --> 00:19:54,955
Hyeok Ryang. What made you write to our show?

580
00:19:55,395 --> 00:19:58,324
I wanted to show off to the viewers that we had a great center...

581
00:19:58,325 --> 00:19:59,625
within our apartment complex.

582
00:19:59,895 --> 00:20:01,364
Since I have so much fun with them,

583
00:20:01,365 --> 00:20:03,935
I want to brag about them. So I wrote to the show.

584
00:20:04,665 --> 00:20:08,874
What kind of dance were you doing when we walked in earlier?

585
00:20:08,875 --> 00:20:11,844
- That's "Opalite."
- The middle one?

586
00:20:11,845 --> 00:20:15,944
It's Taylor Swift's challenge dance that's been trending these days.

587
00:20:15,945 --> 00:20:18,814
- I see.
- I added the challenge dance...

588
00:20:18,815 --> 00:20:22,754
while keeping the rest with the Zumba moves.

589
00:20:22,755 --> 00:20:24,675
(They also mastered the trendy challenge dance.)

590
00:20:24,985 --> 00:20:28,254
Then do you guys film the challenge dance and post it...

591
00:20:28,255 --> 00:20:29,994
- on your social media?
- Of course.

592
00:20:29,995 --> 00:20:31,641
- We film a lot of short videos.
- Really?

593
00:20:31,665 --> 00:20:33,524
What's the most recent one you filmed?

594
00:20:33,525 --> 00:20:34,734
The most recent one...

595
00:20:34,735 --> 00:20:36,964
- We recently did a song by Hwasa.
- Hwasa.

596
00:20:36,965 --> 00:20:37,965
"Good Goodbye."

597
00:20:37,966 --> 00:20:39,464
("Good Goodbye" by Hwasa)

598
00:20:39,465 --> 00:20:40,765
I also watched yours.

599
00:20:40,905 --> 00:20:42,305
You did "Good Goodbye?"

600
00:20:42,435 --> 00:20:45,974
(They even wore themed outfits...)

601
00:20:45,975 --> 00:20:49,115
(for these high-quality challenge videos.)

602
00:20:52,285 --> 00:20:53,485
You did "Good Goodbye?"

603
00:20:54,145 --> 00:20:56,385
Young Woo did that while wearing a tank top.

604
00:20:56,555 --> 00:20:58,184
He's a good dancer.

605
00:20:58,185 --> 00:21:00,185
The video of him dancing in a tank top went viral.

606
00:21:00,385 --> 00:21:01,695
I watched it.

607
00:21:02,355 --> 00:21:04,324
(Everyone has already heard about his video.)

608
00:21:04,325 --> 00:21:05,925
- Some of you already watched it.
- Yes.

609
00:21:06,065 --> 00:21:07,694
- They watched it.
- Young Woo.

610
00:21:07,695 --> 00:21:09,455
- You know who I am?
- What did you think...

611
00:21:09,495 --> 00:21:10,594
after seeing his dance?

612
00:21:10,595 --> 00:21:13,564
(How will the front-row dancers evaluate his dance?)

613
00:21:13,565 --> 00:21:15,575
You can join us for more practice.

614
00:21:16,735 --> 00:21:17,905
For more practice.

615
00:21:18,775 --> 00:21:20,021
(He's singled out as a weak dancer.)

616
00:21:20,045 --> 00:21:22,715
- But he was passionate.
- Welcome.

617
00:21:22,815 --> 00:21:24,984
- He was passionate, though.
- I'll do my best.

618
00:21:24,985 --> 00:21:26,414
Do you dance, Si Ah?

619
00:21:26,415 --> 00:21:29,215
- I'm a bad dancer.
- You are?

620
00:21:29,485 --> 00:21:30,884
- You are?
- Yes.

621
00:21:30,885 --> 00:21:34,024
From the choreography you were doing earlier,

622
00:21:34,025 --> 00:21:36,524
could you teach us a trendy move?

623
00:21:36,525 --> 00:21:39,195
- "Opalite." Should we try it?
- "Opalite."

624
00:21:39,395 --> 00:21:41,234
We can totally pull this off.

625
00:21:41,235 --> 00:21:44,065
Yeon Seok is a great performer too.

626
00:21:44,565 --> 00:21:45,864
Well, sure.

627
00:21:45,865 --> 00:21:48,535
- You've been in musicals too.
- Why don't we all learn it?

628
00:21:49,005 --> 00:21:51,245
Well, I performed with Park Jin Young too.

629
00:21:52,005 --> 00:21:53,574
I mastered the choreography...

630
00:21:53,575 --> 00:21:54,644
- from all three major labels.
- Right.

631
00:21:54,645 --> 00:21:56,925
(The dancing king, Jae Suk, mastered all 3 major labels.)

632
00:21:57,845 --> 00:21:59,284
- We'll do it right away?
- So...

633
00:21:59,285 --> 00:22:00,845
(They step up to the stage right away.)

634
00:22:02,355 --> 00:22:03,355
Where?

635
00:22:03,356 --> 00:22:07,785
(The challenge for "Opalite")

636
00:22:08,295 --> 00:22:10,794
(The choreography is relatively easy and simple.)

637
00:22:10,795 --> 00:22:11,864
This is hard.

638
00:22:11,865 --> 00:22:12,865
(She's already worried.)

639
00:22:13,695 --> 00:22:16,534
We watched Young Woo's video earlier.

640
00:22:16,535 --> 00:22:19,264
- Right.
- He danced in a tank top. Right?

641
00:22:19,265 --> 00:22:20,604
- He's good too.
- He is, right?

642
00:22:20,605 --> 00:22:22,085
- Yes. Young Woo is great.
- Show us.

643
00:22:22,235 --> 00:22:26,374
- Show us.
- Show us.

644
00:22:26,375 --> 00:22:27,415
(Let's see what he's got!)

645
00:22:30,515 --> 00:22:31,845
I'm a bad dancer.

646
00:22:32,745 --> 00:22:33,915
- You are?
- Yes.

647
00:22:34,115 --> 00:22:36,514
Young Woo did that while wearing a tank top.

648
00:22:36,515 --> 00:22:38,755
I mastered the choreography from all three major labels.

649
00:22:39,285 --> 00:22:40,424
It won't take long.

650
00:22:40,425 --> 00:22:42,755
(Crew Whenever, the Front-Row Mission)

651
00:22:43,625 --> 00:22:45,194
Okay. Push the elbow.

652
00:22:45,195 --> 00:22:46,925
I see. Push the hips too.

653
00:22:47,695 --> 00:22:50,235
(Showing favoritism from the get-go)

654
00:22:50,295 --> 00:22:52,834
- One hand. Then both hands.
- Pull.

655
00:22:52,835 --> 00:22:54,064
- Both hands.
- Yes. After that,

656
00:22:54,065 --> 00:22:55,834
- shimmy your shoulders.
- Shimmy.

657
00:22:55,835 --> 00:22:57,081
Yes. Shimmy your shoulders gently.

658
00:22:57,105 --> 00:22:58,705
- After that...
- Shimmy.

659
00:22:58,975 --> 00:23:01,075
(The archaeopteryxes are satisfied.)

660
00:23:01,415 --> 00:23:04,244
- Shimmy your shoulders.
- You're good.

661
00:23:04,245 --> 00:23:06,815
- Pull. Push. Left hand up.
- Poke. Left hand up.

662
00:23:06,985 --> 00:23:09,554
- Sway your hips.
- Sway your hips.

663
00:23:09,555 --> 00:23:11,054
- Jump.
- Jump up.

664
00:23:11,055 --> 00:23:12,055
It's your left hand.

665
00:23:12,056 --> 00:23:13,624
- It's your left hand. After that, - Left hand.

666
00:23:13,625 --> 00:23:14,954
Shake your left bottom...

667
00:23:14,955 --> 00:23:16,915
- and then your right bottom.
- The right bottom.

668
00:23:17,295 --> 00:23:18,364
(Left hand)

669
00:23:18,365 --> 00:23:20,625
Shake your left bottom and then your right bottom.

670
00:23:20,695 --> 00:23:23,064
- Left. Right.
- Sway your hips.

671
00:23:23,065 --> 00:23:25,104
- Turn.
- Turn.

672
00:23:25,105 --> 00:23:27,404
Push. Poke. Left hand up.

673
00:23:27,405 --> 00:23:29,774
- Sway your hips.
- Sway your hips.

674
00:23:29,775 --> 00:23:32,244
- Turn.
- This is way too hard.

675
00:23:32,245 --> 00:23:34,645
- Up and down.
- Up and down.

676
00:23:35,045 --> 00:23:37,375
(Meanwhile, Yeon Shik, the South American dancer...)

677
00:23:37,575 --> 00:23:40,485
- Up and down.
- Up and down.

678
00:23:43,255 --> 00:23:44,584
- He's good!
- Up and down.

679
00:23:44,585 --> 00:23:45,865
(He's still got the Latin vibe.)

680
00:23:49,555 --> 00:23:52,165
(Even his ending pose is perfect.)

681
00:23:54,125 --> 00:23:55,194
(You can join the front row.)

682
00:23:55,195 --> 00:23:56,595
- He's great.
- He's good.

683
00:23:57,665 --> 00:23:58,705
He's good.

684
00:23:58,835 --> 00:24:00,664
- You try it, Yeon Seok.
- Seriously. He's so good.

685
00:24:00,665 --> 00:24:02,034
- Go ahead.
- Do it with me.

686
00:24:02,035 --> 00:24:03,334
- Come on, Yeon Seok.
- What...

687
00:24:03,335 --> 00:24:05,204
- Come on. Do it.
- Did you practice this?

688
00:24:05,205 --> 00:24:06,904
They all said you were good.

689
00:24:06,905 --> 00:24:09,444
- Let's do it with the music.
- With the music.

690
00:24:09,445 --> 00:24:10,545
With the music.

691
00:24:12,645 --> 00:24:15,254
- I've never heard of it.
- "Opalite."

692
00:24:15,255 --> 00:24:16,695
(Fully activating his concentration)

693
00:24:17,755 --> 00:24:19,585
One, two, three.

694
00:24:21,695 --> 00:24:23,454
- One, two, three. The hips.
- The hips.

695
00:24:23,455 --> 00:24:25,464
- Sway your hips.
- Sway your hips.

696
00:24:25,465 --> 00:24:27,364
- Turn.
- Turn.

697
00:24:27,365 --> 00:24:29,265
- Up and down.
- Go. Down.

698
00:24:29,995 --> 00:24:31,164
(These two dancers are struggling hard.)

699
00:24:31,165 --> 00:24:33,105
- Up and down.
- Up and down.

700
00:24:33,765 --> 00:24:34,975
This is crazy.

701
00:24:35,005 --> 00:24:36,575
(Messing up the choreography)

702
00:24:37,105 --> 00:24:38,405
- Hey.
- One more time.

703
00:24:38,775 --> 00:24:40,474
- One, two, three.
- Let's go.

704
00:24:40,475 --> 00:24:42,074
- Another one?
- One more time.

705
00:24:42,075 --> 00:24:45,714
(He's back on the beat now.)

706
00:24:45,715 --> 00:24:48,385
- Up and down.
- Up and down.

707
00:24:50,415 --> 00:24:53,955
(They somehow manage to finish.)

708
00:24:55,895 --> 00:24:57,494
Si Ah, you were pretty good.

709
00:24:57,495 --> 00:24:59,364
- You think so?
- Yes, you were good.

710
00:24:59,365 --> 00:25:01,565
I can do it when someone teaches me.

711
00:25:01,835 --> 00:25:02,965
Si Ah is great.

712
00:25:03,235 --> 00:25:05,305
Young Woo, what happened?

713
00:25:05,805 --> 00:25:07,834
- You must join us.
- What was that?

714
00:25:07,835 --> 00:25:09,275
(Join us for more practice.)

715
00:25:09,375 --> 00:25:10,435
Gosh, seriously.

716
00:25:10,675 --> 00:25:13,074
Dancers are all about the looks. No. Looks are everything for dancers.

717
00:25:13,075 --> 00:25:14,174
(Agreeing)

718
00:25:14,175 --> 00:25:15,375
- His looks.
- It's his looks.

719
00:25:15,545 --> 00:25:16,714
Good looks make everything okay.

720
00:25:16,715 --> 00:25:19,414
That's disappointing. Looks are everything for dancers?

721
00:25:19,415 --> 00:25:20,684
(The bad dancer reads between the lines.)

722
00:25:20,685 --> 00:25:22,255
What was that? Come on.

723
00:25:23,655 --> 00:25:25,954
- Who on earth said that?
- It was her.

724
00:25:25,955 --> 00:25:27,984
- She said it, right here.
- "Dancers are all about the looks."

725
00:25:27,985 --> 00:25:29,694
(She can't lift her head.)

726
00:25:29,695 --> 00:25:31,924
What do you guys usually do around this time?

727
00:25:31,925 --> 00:25:33,424
You requested us to be here...

728
00:25:33,425 --> 00:25:35,864
- around 10am.
- By this time, our class is over.

729
00:25:35,865 --> 00:25:38,104
- People who have work leave.
- Okay.

730
00:25:38,105 --> 00:25:39,234
- They go back to work.
- Yes.

731
00:25:39,235 --> 00:25:41,534
Some of us go for coffee if that's what we want.

732
00:25:41,535 --> 00:25:44,905
We have a cup of coffee at an unmanned cafe in our complex.

733
00:25:45,475 --> 00:25:47,504
- Tae Hyun once said this.
- Yes.

734
00:25:47,505 --> 00:25:51,814
Parents meet up after sending their kids to school for coffee.

735
00:25:51,815 --> 00:25:53,914
They decide which drama and movie become popular.

736
00:25:53,915 --> 00:25:55,185
- They decide that.
- Yes.

737
00:25:55,285 --> 00:25:57,314
- They start the whole trend.
- It usually happens that way.

738
00:25:57,315 --> 00:25:58,324
(The origin of the word-of-mouth trends)

739
00:25:58,325 --> 00:26:01,055
- Their movie will be released soon.
- Gosh.

740
00:26:02,195 --> 00:26:04,824
(The word-of-mouth panel is focused.)

741
00:26:04,825 --> 00:26:06,194
- It's a romantic film.
- Gosh.

742
00:26:06,195 --> 00:26:09,035
(Romance!)

743
00:26:09,595 --> 00:26:14,034
Yes. There's a girl with a medical condition...

744
00:26:14,035 --> 00:26:15,074
that wipes her memory.

745
00:26:15,075 --> 00:26:16,674
- There's a girl.
- My character loses her memory...

746
00:26:16,675 --> 00:26:18,345
- when she wakes up.
- Right.

747
00:26:18,605 --> 00:26:21,744
Then she meets her first love.

748
00:26:21,745 --> 00:26:23,614
She loves him so much.

749
00:26:23,615 --> 00:26:25,414
- But it's heartbreaking, - Oh, no.

750
00:26:25,415 --> 00:26:26,514
Knowing the person you like...

751
00:26:26,515 --> 00:26:27,584
- forgets about you every time.
- Of course.

752
00:26:27,585 --> 00:26:31,115
The movie shows how the two characters handle it.

753
00:26:31,285 --> 00:26:33,354
It'll be much more interesting than expected.

754
00:26:33,355 --> 00:26:36,455
- Nice one, Si Ah.
- Is that so?

755
00:26:36,795 --> 00:26:38,225
Tell us the title.

756
00:26:38,265 --> 00:26:39,265
Right.

757
00:26:39,325 --> 00:26:44,905
"Even If This Love Disappears from the World Tonight."

758
00:26:45,205 --> 00:26:46,904
- Sorry?
- What?

759
00:26:46,905 --> 00:26:48,705
- The title is so long.
- What?

760
00:26:50,605 --> 00:26:52,445
- It's long, isn't it?
- Tell us once again.

761
00:26:52,575 --> 00:26:54,204
- "Sorry?"
- "Even If..."

762
00:26:54,205 --> 00:26:55,914
For short, it's "ELDWT."

763
00:26:55,915 --> 00:26:58,185
- "ELDWT."
- Yes, "ELDWT."

764
00:26:58,285 --> 00:27:00,145
- "ELDWT."
- That surprised them.

765
00:27:00,315 --> 00:27:01,885
- "ELDWT."
- "ELDWT."

766
00:27:02,715 --> 00:27:05,254
The atmosphere is telling me...

767
00:27:05,255 --> 00:27:06,654
you won't watch the movie.

768
00:27:06,655 --> 00:27:08,124
(Busted)

769
00:27:08,125 --> 00:27:10,024
"ELDWT."

770
00:27:10,025 --> 00:27:11,965
("ELDWT" is gone with the wind.)

771
00:27:12,025 --> 00:27:14,424
- You promised to watch it, okay?
- We promise.

772
00:27:14,425 --> 00:27:16,135
- We'll take a proof photo.
- Good.

773
00:27:16,235 --> 00:27:19,034
Now then, let's see what we're doing today.

774
00:27:19,035 --> 00:27:20,604
We should give it a try, right?

775
00:27:20,605 --> 00:27:22,534
How about you throw it, Si Ah?

776
00:27:22,535 --> 00:27:25,175
- Okay, I'll give it a throw.
- Go ahead.

777
00:27:25,475 --> 00:27:26,945
- In 1, 2, 3. Let's go.
- Let's go.

778
00:27:27,905 --> 00:27:28,945
How cute.

779
00:27:29,475 --> 00:27:32,545
(Earns as many bonus coupons as the number rolled)

780
00:27:32,985 --> 00:27:35,585
(Please be "2!")

781
00:27:36,285 --> 00:27:37,654
- One.
- Number one.

782
00:27:37,655 --> 00:27:39,154
- It's okay.
- Only one?

783
00:27:39,155 --> 00:27:40,785
- Only one.
- Only one.

784
00:27:41,385 --> 00:27:43,794
Let's see what kind of prize she'll draw.

785
00:27:43,795 --> 00:27:45,394
- Go for it.
- Good luck.

786
00:27:45,395 --> 00:27:47,794
Please check the prize for Round One, Hyeok Ryang.

787
00:27:47,795 --> 00:27:49,934
- Here.
- The prizes...

788
00:27:49,935 --> 00:27:52,364
- could be things like trainers...
- Yes?

789
00:27:52,365 --> 00:27:53,725
- Trainers.
- for all the members.

790
00:27:53,935 --> 00:27:55,004
Give it some good luck.

791
00:27:55,005 --> 00:27:56,034
(Passing on good luck)

792
00:27:56,035 --> 00:27:57,675
- There you go.
- Take this.

793
00:27:57,775 --> 00:27:58,775
Read it for us.

794
00:27:59,245 --> 00:28:01,744
"Tea time after every dance class."

795
00:28:01,745 --> 00:28:03,814
"We want to chat over some snacks."

796
00:28:03,815 --> 00:28:07,145
"A delivery app 300-dollar voucher."

797
00:28:08,615 --> 00:28:10,515
- That's nice. I mean, 300 dollars?
- Nice.

798
00:28:12,125 --> 00:28:14,785
- It's 300 dollars.
- Yes, 300 dollars.

799
00:28:15,455 --> 00:28:16,754
Can we get it?

800
00:28:16,755 --> 00:28:19,625
- No, only when we succeed.
- I see.

801
00:28:19,965 --> 00:28:22,034
(Feeling the sudden pressure now)

802
00:28:22,035 --> 00:28:23,665
- We must succeed.
- Right?

803
00:28:24,635 --> 00:28:25,865
(Anxious)

804
00:28:26,565 --> 00:28:28,335
(While preparing for the mission)

805
00:28:28,405 --> 00:28:30,965
I'll introduce you as the woman living with @Yoo Jae Suk 1-on-1.

806
00:28:31,475 --> 00:28:32,475
What is it?

807
00:28:32,476 --> 00:28:34,144
Hyeok Ryang wants to do something.

808
00:28:34,145 --> 00:28:36,275
- What is it?
- She's Imun-dong's...

809
00:28:36,375 --> 00:28:38,984
Na Kyung Eun from Temu,

810
00:28:38,985 --> 00:28:40,785
and her husband's name is Yoo Jae Suk.

811
00:28:42,055 --> 00:28:43,155
Oh, my.

812
00:28:43,215 --> 00:28:44,654
I wanted to introduce you to her.

813
00:28:44,655 --> 00:28:46,125
- Really?
- You see...

814
00:28:46,255 --> 00:28:47,854
My husband, Yoo Jae Suk,

815
00:28:47,855 --> 00:28:49,455
- was also born in 1972.
- Is that so?

816
00:28:49,755 --> 00:28:51,594
Your lunar birthday and my husband's solar birthday...

817
00:28:51,595 --> 00:28:52,665
are just one day apart.

818
00:28:52,865 --> 00:28:54,464
In the past, your fans thought...

819
00:28:54,465 --> 00:28:56,335
my husband's Cyworld belonged to you...

820
00:28:56,535 --> 00:28:59,305
and wrote, "I'm a fan. I love you."

821
00:28:59,765 --> 00:29:01,904
Even to this day,

822
00:29:01,905 --> 00:29:03,874
he hasn't disclosed the truth.

823
00:29:03,875 --> 00:29:05,274
How long have you been married?

824
00:29:05,275 --> 00:29:06,944
It's been 24 years.

825
00:29:06,945 --> 00:29:08,714
(24 years with Yoo Jae Suk)

826
00:29:08,715 --> 00:29:12,685
How does it feel to live with Yoo Jae Suk for 24 years?

827
00:29:12,745 --> 00:29:14,315
Every year feels like the worst.

828
00:29:18,485 --> 00:29:19,584
I hope you overcome...

829
00:29:19,585 --> 00:29:20,585
- the worst year.
- Thank you.

830
00:29:20,586 --> 00:29:22,386
- I'm overcoming it through dancing.
- I see.

831
00:29:23,725 --> 00:29:25,294
(The delivery app voucher is on the line for this mission.)

832
00:29:25,295 --> 00:29:27,825
(Hula Hula)

833
00:29:27,865 --> 00:29:29,464
(Keep the balloon up with the hula hoop...)

834
00:29:29,465 --> 00:29:32,034
(and return from the halfway point as a relay.)

835
00:29:32,035 --> 00:29:33,364
(Round 1)

836
00:29:33,365 --> 00:29:37,034
(Time limit: 40 seconds)

837
00:29:37,035 --> 00:29:39,244
- That's hard.
- "Keep the balloon up?"

838
00:29:39,245 --> 00:29:40,404
(Keep the balloon up with the hula hoop?)

839
00:29:40,405 --> 00:29:41,974
Isn't that too small?

840
00:29:41,975 --> 00:29:44,215
- Aren't those heavy?
- We're not spinning them, are we?

841
00:29:44,415 --> 00:29:46,445
- This looks hard.
- Put it around our waist.

842
00:29:46,515 --> 00:29:48,485
- Around our waist?
- I see.

843
00:29:48,585 --> 00:29:50,185
- Around our waist.
- Around our waist.

844
00:29:50,555 --> 00:29:52,984
- Hit the balloon with it.
- As a relay?

845
00:29:52,985 --> 00:29:54,655
The 4 of us have 40 seconds.

846
00:29:54,785 --> 00:29:56,194
But it doesn't look easy.

847
00:29:56,195 --> 00:29:57,854
- It's impossible.
- We can't stop midway.

848
00:29:57,855 --> 00:29:58,994
- It's not bad.
- This...

849
00:29:58,995 --> 00:30:00,125
We don't have much time.

850
00:30:00,295 --> 00:30:01,324
Let's practice.

851
00:30:01,325 --> 00:30:02,864
We can't use our hands, can we?

852
00:30:02,865 --> 00:30:04,634
- No.
- You can't touch it with your hand.

853
00:30:04,635 --> 00:30:06,034
- I see.
- This isn't easy at all.

854
00:30:06,035 --> 00:30:07,334
It looks tough.

855
00:30:07,335 --> 00:30:08,604
(Practicing)

856
00:30:08,605 --> 00:30:10,285
- It's hard.
- The balloon will go inside.

857
00:30:10,705 --> 00:30:11,844
- Yes.
- That's it.

858
00:30:11,845 --> 00:30:13,775
- Hit it.
- Hit it up like this.

859
00:30:13,945 --> 00:30:15,315
- Go.
- That's it.

860
00:30:15,745 --> 00:30:17,514
- Nice.
- Si Ah.

861
00:30:17,515 --> 00:30:18,645
(Screaming)

862
00:30:18,745 --> 00:30:19,845
You did it.

863
00:30:21,285 --> 00:30:22,454
(Moving forward while barely hitting the balloon)

864
00:30:22,455 --> 00:30:23,514
You're good.

865
00:30:23,515 --> 00:30:24,715
We have to be gentle.

866
00:30:24,955 --> 00:30:26,455
Don't use your feet.

867
00:30:26,925 --> 00:30:27,925
Nice.

868
00:30:27,926 --> 00:30:29,294
(It's a success if she returns to the starting line...)

869
00:30:29,295 --> 00:30:31,525
(after the turning point.)

870
00:30:32,995 --> 00:30:34,225
- Go.
- Okay, Young Woo.

871
00:30:34,365 --> 00:30:36,195
- Get going.
- Go.

872
00:30:36,395 --> 00:30:37,495
That's it.

873
00:30:38,705 --> 00:30:41,464
(It's a fail if the balloon hits the floor.)

874
00:30:41,465 --> 00:30:42,535
Forty seconds.

875
00:30:45,035 --> 00:30:46,344
(Using a trick)

876
00:30:46,345 --> 00:30:47,375
Wait a minute.

877
00:30:47,605 --> 00:30:48,644
(Is this okay?)

878
00:30:48,645 --> 00:30:49,715
No, come on.

879
00:30:49,915 --> 00:30:51,115
No?

880
00:30:51,645 --> 00:30:52,885
- No.
- No?

881
00:30:53,445 --> 00:30:55,654
(Look at this kid.)

882
00:30:55,655 --> 00:30:56,715
Come on.

883
00:30:58,315 --> 00:30:59,554
- Forty seconds is too short.
- Right?

884
00:30:59,555 --> 00:31:02,124
We'll get on with the first try.

885
00:31:02,125 --> 00:31:03,205
Forty seconds is too short.

886
00:31:03,355 --> 00:31:04,425
Are they going for it?

887
00:31:04,925 --> 00:31:06,624
- Why don't you start, Si Ah?
- Me?

888
00:31:06,625 --> 00:31:08,064
- Si Ah.
- Within 40 seconds?

889
00:31:08,065 --> 00:31:10,394
Now then, it'll be Si Ah, me,

890
00:31:10,395 --> 00:31:12,035
- Young Woo, and then Yeon Seok.
- Okay.

891
00:31:12,065 --> 00:31:13,364
In 1, 2, 3.

892
00:31:13,365 --> 00:31:14,604
- Good luck!
- Good luck!

893
00:31:14,605 --> 00:31:16,905
(Out of 10 total tries, they're on try number 1.)

894
00:31:17,635 --> 00:31:18,645
Ready?

895
00:31:19,075 --> 00:31:20,075
Set.

896
00:31:22,375 --> 00:31:23,774
Good.

897
00:31:23,775 --> 00:31:24,945
(1st try, Si Ah)

898
00:31:25,845 --> 00:31:27,044
(A heading?)

899
00:31:27,045 --> 00:31:28,045
Nice.

900
00:31:28,315 --> 00:31:29,454
Go slow.

901
00:31:29,455 --> 00:31:30,784
(Screaming)

902
00:31:30,785 --> 00:31:32,884
- It's okay.
- You're doing good.

903
00:31:32,885 --> 00:31:36,525
(Advancing ever so slowly while dancing a passionate tango)

904
00:31:38,255 --> 00:31:39,495
(Screaming)

905
00:31:39,765 --> 00:31:40,795
What are you doing?

906
00:31:41,665 --> 00:31:43,065
- Si Ah!
- Jae Suk!

907
00:31:43,865 --> 00:31:45,234
Si Ah!

908
00:31:45,235 --> 00:31:48,205
(Jae Suk saved it!)

909
00:31:48,365 --> 00:31:50,175
- Nice one.
- Go.

910
00:31:50,935 --> 00:31:54,304
(1st try, Jae Suk)

911
00:31:54,305 --> 00:31:56,445
- Hold on.
- You did it.

912
00:31:56,715 --> 00:31:57,775
- Nice.
- Okay.

913
00:31:58,115 --> 00:32:00,144
- I saved it.
- You totally saved it.

914
00:32:00,145 --> 00:32:01,644
- Young Woo.
- I did.

915
00:32:01,645 --> 00:32:03,585
Go. Here.

916
00:32:03,855 --> 00:32:04,955
All set. Now go.

917
00:32:05,055 --> 00:32:06,684
- Here.
- Okay.

918
00:32:06,685 --> 00:32:08,594
- Go.
- Nice.

919
00:32:08,595 --> 00:32:11,995
- Go.
- Keep going.

920
00:32:12,295 --> 00:32:13,494
- You can do it.
- Go.

921
00:32:13,495 --> 00:32:15,464
- You can do it.
- Come on.

922
00:32:15,465 --> 00:32:16,964
- Two.
- Come.

923
00:32:16,965 --> 00:32:18,765
(1st try, Young Woo)

924
00:32:20,435 --> 00:32:22,775
(Failed due to the time limit)

925
00:32:23,675 --> 00:32:27,275
(Time over as soon as Yeon Seok set off)

926
00:32:28,145 --> 00:32:30,515
- It's hard.
- This is too hard.

927
00:32:30,945 --> 00:32:32,284
- It's hard.
- Forty seconds is...

928
00:32:32,285 --> 00:32:34,045
- It's tough.
- Forty seconds is impossible.

929
00:32:34,885 --> 00:32:37,415
We have to move forward as we hit the balloon.

930
00:32:37,885 --> 00:32:38,885
It's like...

931
00:32:39,155 --> 00:32:40,624
- Yes, just like that.
- Keep going.

932
00:32:40,625 --> 00:32:41,725
Like this.

933
00:32:41,825 --> 00:32:43,254
- That's the slowest pace.
- I want to succeed.

934
00:32:43,255 --> 00:32:44,995
- How about another practice?
- Okay.

935
00:32:45,095 --> 00:32:48,164
The next player should head out around here.

936
00:32:48,165 --> 00:32:49,295
- Yes.
- I see.

937
00:32:49,865 --> 00:32:52,164
Leave as you receive the balloon.

938
00:32:52,165 --> 00:32:53,564
(A fast cornering)

939
00:32:53,565 --> 00:32:55,165
- One more time.
- Jae Suk.

940
00:32:55,935 --> 00:32:57,335
- Okay.
- Then...

941
00:32:57,375 --> 00:33:00,045
(Practice, Jae Suk)

942
00:33:00,705 --> 00:33:03,414
(He's quite fast.)

943
00:33:03,415 --> 00:33:05,244
Go. Get going, Si Ah.

944
00:33:05,245 --> 00:33:06,385
Here, go.

945
00:33:06,885 --> 00:33:08,485
- That's it.
- Nice.

946
00:33:08,885 --> 00:33:11,454
All right. Good.

947
00:33:11,455 --> 00:33:12,754
(Practice, Si Ah)

948
00:33:12,755 --> 00:33:15,654
- That's it. She's done. Go now.
- Me, Si Ah.

949
00:33:15,655 --> 00:33:16,924
- I'll go.
- Your turn, Young Woo.

950
00:33:16,925 --> 00:33:19,325
(The last player sets off with 10 seconds left.)

951
00:33:20,165 --> 00:33:21,894
That's it. All right.

952
00:33:21,895 --> 00:33:23,865
Four seconds, Young Woo.

953
00:33:24,995 --> 00:33:26,165
Well done.

954
00:33:26,605 --> 00:33:28,364
(Succeeded with 3 seconds left)

955
00:33:28,365 --> 00:33:30,805
- This is it.
- This will work. We can do it.

956
00:33:31,305 --> 00:33:33,074
(Cheering)

957
00:33:33,075 --> 00:33:34,674
- Remember this feeling.
- Let's stick to the same order.

958
00:33:34,675 --> 00:33:35,945
- Then...
- From here...

959
00:33:36,045 --> 00:33:37,344
It's our third try.

960
00:33:37,345 --> 00:33:38,884
- Okay.
- In 1, 2, 3.

961
00:33:38,885 --> 00:33:40,084
- Let's do this!
- Good luck!

962
00:33:40,085 --> 00:33:42,285
(Out of 10 total tries, they're on try number 3.)

963
00:33:45,625 --> 00:33:46,654
Good luck.

964
00:33:46,655 --> 00:33:48,524
(3rd try, Yeon Seok)

965
00:33:48,525 --> 00:33:49,795
- Okay.
- Go slow.

966
00:33:50,095 --> 00:33:52,195
- Okay.
- That's it, Yeon Seok. No rush.

967
00:33:52,565 --> 00:33:53,594
- Good.
- Nice.

968
00:33:53,595 --> 00:33:54,765
All right.

969
00:33:55,395 --> 00:33:57,565
- Go.
- Yes.

970
00:33:57,665 --> 00:34:00,365
- Not bad.
- Good job.

971
00:34:00,605 --> 00:34:01,934
- Nice.
- Gosh.

972
00:34:01,935 --> 00:34:03,334
(3rd try, Jae Suk)

973
00:34:03,335 --> 00:34:05,975
- It's okay.
- The next player.

974
00:34:06,045 --> 00:34:07,874
- Good.
- You're doing great.

975
00:34:07,875 --> 00:34:09,614
- Nice.
- Good.

976
00:34:09,615 --> 00:34:11,215
Good luck. Go for it.

977
00:34:11,945 --> 00:34:13,015
Nice.

978
00:34:14,685 --> 00:34:16,455
(Saving time by cornering fast)

979
00:34:16,915 --> 00:34:18,885
Nice. Yes, that's it.

980
00:34:19,325 --> 00:34:20,954
- Come in.
- Go, Young Woo.

981
00:34:20,955 --> 00:34:22,324
- Come in.
- You did it.

982
00:34:22,325 --> 00:34:23,954
- Young Woo.
- Go.

983
00:34:23,955 --> 00:34:25,724
(3rd try, Young Woo)

984
00:34:25,725 --> 00:34:27,624
- Young Woo.
- Go.

985
00:34:27,625 --> 00:34:29,935
- Good luck!
- Hurry, Young Woo!

986
00:34:30,595 --> 00:34:32,735
(Only Young Woo has to succeed now!)

987
00:34:33,465 --> 00:34:34,764
- Young Woo.
- Go.

988
00:34:34,765 --> 00:34:36,034
- Good luck!
- Hurry, Young Woo!

989
00:34:36,035 --> 00:34:38,504
(But he makes a U-turn before cornering fully?)

990
00:34:38,505 --> 00:34:40,005
- Two, one.
- Young Woo.

991
00:34:40,075 --> 00:34:42,045
(Time over)

992
00:34:44,215 --> 00:34:45,415
We did it, no?

993
00:34:46,185 --> 00:34:49,154
- What?
- You didn't go around the pole.

994
00:34:49,155 --> 00:34:51,235
- You came the other way.
- You had to go around it.

995
00:34:51,515 --> 00:34:53,324
I have to turn, not the balloon?

996
00:34:53,325 --> 00:34:54,685
- It's you.
- Your body.

997
00:34:55,755 --> 00:34:57,624
It's okay. You were great.

998
00:34:57,625 --> 00:34:58,664
Sorry.

999
00:34:58,665 --> 00:35:02,435
- It's okay!
- It's okay!

1000
00:35:03,295 --> 00:35:04,994
- It's okay because he's handsome.
- It's okay...

1001
00:35:04,995 --> 00:35:06,475
- because he's handsome.
- It's okay!

1002
00:35:07,205 --> 00:35:08,604
It's okay because he's handsome.

1003
00:35:08,605 --> 00:35:10,935
- We forgive you.
- It's okay.

1004
00:35:11,305 --> 00:35:14,345
(It's okay because he's handsome?)

1005
00:35:15,005 --> 00:35:16,645
But not Yoo Jae Suk.

1006
00:35:17,775 --> 00:35:20,285
Come now. Aren't you...

1007
00:35:20,885 --> 00:35:22,655
Aren't they too biased?

1008
00:35:23,585 --> 00:35:25,154
I didn't even fail.

1009
00:35:25,155 --> 00:35:26,224
(The best player, The player who didn't know the rules)

1010
00:35:26,225 --> 00:35:28,125
I'm not okay even though I didn't even fail.

1011
00:35:28,555 --> 00:35:30,095
- You didn't do anything.
- Really.

1012
00:35:30,525 --> 00:35:32,085
I'm not okay when I didn't do anything.

1013
00:35:32,325 --> 00:35:34,194
(Strict when it comes to the name "Yoo Jae Suk")

1014
00:35:34,195 --> 00:35:36,364
- It's okay!
- It's okay!

1015
00:35:36,365 --> 00:35:37,665
What a bummer.

1016
00:35:37,835 --> 00:35:39,334
- I'll start.
- Okay.

1017
00:35:39,335 --> 00:35:40,765
- Young Woo will start.
- Yes.

1018
00:35:41,105 --> 00:35:42,534
- He's got it now.
- Yes.

1019
00:35:42,535 --> 00:35:44,234
- He's got the hang of it.
- Exactly.

1020
00:35:44,235 --> 00:35:45,334
- How about this order?
- Sure.

1021
00:35:45,335 --> 00:35:46,404
- Okay.
- Good.

1022
00:35:46,405 --> 00:35:48,305
Young Woo, Yeon Seok, Si Ah, and then me.

1023
00:35:48,445 --> 00:35:50,174
- Let's do this!
- Let's do this!

1024
00:35:50,175 --> 00:35:51,544
- Let's do this!
- Good luck!

1025
00:35:51,545 --> 00:35:52,644
(Out of 10 total tries, they're on try number 5.)

1026
00:35:52,645 --> 00:35:54,085
We must succeed this time.

1027
00:35:55,415 --> 00:35:57,985
- Let's do this.
- Ready, set.

1028
00:36:00,562 --> 00:36:01,662
Nice.

1029
00:36:02,232 --> 00:36:03,502
- Okay.
- Good.

1030
00:36:04,272 --> 00:36:05,331
- Okay.
- Wait.

1031
00:36:05,332 --> 00:36:06,401
(5th try, Young Woo)

1032
00:36:06,402 --> 00:36:07,502
- Okay.
- Gosh.

1033
00:36:12,512 --> 00:36:13,712
Come on.

1034
00:36:14,412 --> 00:36:16,381
(Ended right away)

1035
00:36:16,382 --> 00:36:18,051
- This is...
- Go that way.

1036
00:36:18,052 --> 00:36:19,181
- No.
- Young Woo!

1037
00:36:19,182 --> 00:36:21,882
(Young Woo?)

1038
00:36:22,792 --> 00:36:24,792
This is... Why am I so bad at it?

1039
00:36:26,092 --> 00:36:27,561
- What if we fail in Round One?
- Let's...

1040
00:36:27,562 --> 00:36:29,261
- Gosh.
- Young Woo...

1041
00:36:29,262 --> 00:36:31,761
He's not all that...

1042
00:36:31,762 --> 00:36:33,032
The thing is...

1043
00:36:34,162 --> 00:36:35,702
- I take it back.
- No, you can do it.

1044
00:36:35,902 --> 00:36:37,472
- It's tough.
- Good luck.

1045
00:36:38,902 --> 00:36:40,602
- Okay.
- That should do.

1046
00:36:41,072 --> 00:36:42,772
- Pick up the pace.
- You can do it.

1047
00:36:42,972 --> 00:36:44,132
Make it to the starting line.

1048
00:36:45,442 --> 00:36:46,981
- It's not easy.
- Slow down.

1049
00:36:46,982 --> 00:36:49,412
If Round 1 is this hard, Round 2 must be...

1050
00:36:49,752 --> 00:36:51,681
- The bonus coupon...
- Let's use it.

1051
00:36:51,682 --> 00:36:53,081
- Use it?
- Let's use it.

1052
00:36:53,082 --> 00:36:54,182
Do I switch?

1053
00:36:54,282 --> 00:36:56,451
- Hyeok Ryang.
- Try it.

1054
00:36:56,452 --> 00:36:58,551
You have to switch with one of us.

1055
00:36:58,552 --> 00:37:00,162
I'll switch with her.

1056
00:37:01,162 --> 00:37:03,632
(Volunteering to switch)

1057
00:37:04,262 --> 00:37:05,991
(Laughing)

1058
00:37:05,992 --> 00:37:07,862
He's volunteering to switch.

1059
00:37:08,002 --> 00:37:09,771
- Take a break, Young Woo.
- Here.

1060
00:37:09,772 --> 00:37:11,171
- Take a break.
- Okay.

1061
00:37:11,172 --> 00:37:12,608
- Take a break, Young Woo.
- I will.

1062
00:37:12,632 --> 00:37:14,241
(Meanwhile, )

1063
00:37:14,242 --> 00:37:15,471
- I'll practice.
- Okay.

1064
00:37:15,472 --> 00:37:18,242
(Hyeok Ryang takes the balloon.)

1065
00:37:18,612 --> 00:37:20,041
- Take a break.
- She's good at it.

1066
00:37:20,042 --> 00:37:22,012
- Gosh.
- Hyeok Ryang is good.

1067
00:37:22,412 --> 00:37:23,912
(Oh, my.)

1068
00:37:24,912 --> 00:37:26,281
- Take a break.
- She's good at it.

1069
00:37:26,282 --> 00:37:28,722
- Gosh.
- Hyeok Ryang is good.

1070
00:37:29,022 --> 00:37:30,121
How is she that good?

1071
00:37:30,122 --> 00:37:32,092
(Hyeok Ryang is good at it.)

1072
00:37:32,192 --> 00:37:33,462
Why is she good at it?

1073
00:37:33,522 --> 00:37:35,462
- Nice.
- Well done.

1074
00:37:37,232 --> 00:37:38,862
- Like this?
- The first player.

1075
00:37:39,602 --> 00:37:42,102
(Ms. Pyo is proud of her disciple.)

1076
00:37:43,832 --> 00:37:46,031
- The 1st player.
- The 1st player.

1077
00:37:46,032 --> 00:37:47,201
- Like this?
- The first player.

1078
00:37:47,202 --> 00:37:48,371
The first player.

1079
00:37:48,372 --> 00:37:49,942
(She became the ace right away.)

1080
00:37:50,342 --> 00:37:51,641
Let's cheer.

1081
00:37:51,642 --> 00:37:53,911
- I'm nervous.
- In 1, 2, 3.

1082
00:37:53,912 --> 00:37:55,072
- Let's do this!
- Good luck!

1083
00:37:55,112 --> 00:37:57,282
- She's good.
- Hyeok Ryang is good at it.

1084
00:37:57,382 --> 00:37:58,652
Choi Hyeok Ryang!

1085
00:37:58,812 --> 00:38:00,751
- Choi Hyeok Ryang!
- Relax, okay?

1086
00:38:00,752 --> 00:38:02,251
The balloon doesn't have to turn.

1087
00:38:02,252 --> 00:38:03,552
(Got it.)

1088
00:38:03,852 --> 00:38:05,591
- Good luck.
- Here I go.

1089
00:38:05,592 --> 00:38:06,592
(Supporting her)

1090
00:38:06,892 --> 00:38:07,962
Ready.

1091
00:38:10,362 --> 00:38:11,432
Set.

1092
00:38:14,302 --> 00:38:15,601
(Bonus try, Hyeok Ryang)

1093
00:38:15,602 --> 00:38:16,902
- Good luck.
- Nice.

1094
00:38:17,472 --> 00:38:18,631
- Good.
- Slow down.

1095
00:38:18,632 --> 00:38:20,071
- Go.
- Nice, Hyeok Ryang.

1096
00:38:20,072 --> 00:38:21,541
- Good.
- Well done.

1097
00:38:21,542 --> 00:38:22,802
- Nice.
- Good.

1098
00:38:23,572 --> 00:38:24,572
- All set.
- Hit it.

1099
00:38:24,573 --> 00:38:25,772
- You're done.
- Good.

1100
00:38:26,072 --> 00:38:27,612
(Succeded in 10 seconds!)

1101
00:38:28,182 --> 00:38:29,281
Well done, Hyeok Ryang.

1102
00:38:29,282 --> 00:38:30,312
- Nice.
- Go.

1103
00:38:30,452 --> 00:38:31,512
- You're done.
- Good.

1104
00:38:31,712 --> 00:38:33,321
- Well done, Hyeok Ryang.
- Good job.

1105
00:38:33,322 --> 00:38:35,022
- You're amazing.
- Well done.

1106
00:38:35,282 --> 00:38:36,492
She's great at it.

1107
00:38:36,622 --> 00:38:37,651
Okay.

1108
00:38:37,652 --> 00:38:40,221
(Bonus try, Yeon Seok)

1109
00:38:40,222 --> 00:38:42,362
- Nice, Yeon Shik.
- Be careful.

1110
00:38:42,762 --> 00:38:44,962
Go. Well done, Yeon Shik.

1111
00:38:48,562 --> 00:38:51,302
(Don't let it drop!)

1112
00:38:51,632 --> 00:38:53,442
Well done, Yeon Shik.

1113
00:38:57,372 --> 00:38:59,782
(Failed)

1114
00:38:59,942 --> 00:39:00,942
Oh, no.

1115
00:39:00,943 --> 00:39:02,742
- Goodness.
- What a bummer.

1116
00:39:02,812 --> 00:39:04,712
- That was a waste.
- It's okay.

1117
00:39:05,112 --> 00:39:07,181
- That was a waste.
- It's okay.

1118
00:39:07,182 --> 00:39:08,221
I'm sorry.

1119
00:39:08,222 --> 00:39:11,292
- It's okay.
- It's okay.

1120
00:39:11,692 --> 00:39:12,991
- It's okay.
- It's okay.

1121
00:39:12,992 --> 00:39:14,521
- I'm sorry.
- It's okay.

1122
00:39:14,522 --> 00:39:16,022
- It's okay.
- This is tough.

1123
00:39:16,362 --> 00:39:17,462
It's hard.

1124
00:39:18,232 --> 00:39:19,392
Well done, Hyeok Ryang.

1125
00:39:20,232 --> 00:39:22,032
- Why are you so good at it?
- Right?

1126
00:39:22,462 --> 00:39:24,032
- Is it over?
- We're impatient.

1127
00:39:24,272 --> 00:39:25,272
(Used up the only bonus coupon)

1128
00:39:25,273 --> 00:39:26,742
That's the end of the coupon.

1129
00:39:27,302 --> 00:39:29,372
- But we...
- In Round One?

1130
00:39:30,242 --> 00:39:31,841
- This one's tough.
- I agree.

1131
00:39:31,842 --> 00:39:33,741
- I know, right?
- It's hard.

1132
00:39:33,742 --> 00:39:34,911
The production team is in the wrong.

1133
00:39:34,912 --> 00:39:37,581
- For real. Give us a chance.
- Yes.

1134
00:39:37,582 --> 00:39:40,352
- Please.
- Why did you make it so hard?

1135
00:39:40,682 --> 00:39:42,992
- It's too hard.
- It's tough.

1136
00:39:43,322 --> 00:39:45,122
You see them, right? They're not joking.

1137
00:39:45,752 --> 00:39:48,792
- Seriously.
- It's too tough.

1138
00:39:49,192 --> 00:39:51,732
- Everyone is grumbling, - The time limit is hard.

1139
00:39:51,832 --> 00:39:53,031
But the newbie is...

1140
00:39:53,032 --> 00:39:55,232
(Quiet)

1141
00:39:55,632 --> 00:39:56,671
It's tough.

1142
00:39:56,672 --> 00:40:00,402
The newbie has yet to get used to the whole atmosphere.

1143
00:40:00,972 --> 00:40:02,201
It's only been two months.

1144
00:40:02,202 --> 00:40:03,772
(Adjusting to the atmosphere)

1145
00:40:04,212 --> 00:40:06,111
- Si Ah.
- How about they try together?

1146
00:40:06,112 --> 00:40:07,641
- You and I should go first.
- Yes.

1147
00:40:07,642 --> 00:40:08,642
- Good idea.
- Right?

1148
00:40:08,643 --> 00:40:10,811
- One, two, three, and four?
- Yes.

1149
00:40:10,812 --> 00:40:13,522
- I'm suddenly getting nervous.
- No, you can do it.

1150
00:40:13,752 --> 00:40:15,521
- All right, our seventh try.
- It's okay.

1151
00:40:15,522 --> 00:40:16,791
Let's cheer together.

1152
00:40:16,792 --> 00:40:18,692
- Let's cheer altogether.
- Good luck.

1153
00:40:19,252 --> 00:40:21,962
- In 1, 2, 3. Good luck!
- In 1, 2, 3. Good luck!

1154
00:40:24,292 --> 00:40:25,431
In 1, 2, 3.

1155
00:40:25,432 --> 00:40:26,501
- Here we go!
- Let's go!

1156
00:40:26,502 --> 00:40:28,231
- Good luck!
- Good luck!

1157
00:40:28,232 --> 00:40:30,001
- Do I throw the balloon up first?
- Yes.

1158
00:40:30,002 --> 00:40:31,371
- Throw it up first.
- Okay.

1159
00:40:31,372 --> 00:40:32,372
- Far away.
- Good luck.

1160
00:40:32,373 --> 00:40:33,442
Set.

1161
00:40:35,342 --> 00:40:37,142
- Nice.
- That's it.

1162
00:40:37,372 --> 00:40:39,071
- Slowly.
- Gently.

1163
00:40:39,072 --> 00:40:40,742
- Gently.
- Get ready for her.

1164
00:40:41,642 --> 00:40:43,912
- Good.
- That's it.

1165
00:40:44,182 --> 00:40:45,952
- Done. Now go.
- Good.

1166
00:40:46,682 --> 00:40:48,922
(Young Woo is off.)

1167
00:40:49,082 --> 00:40:50,752
- Here he goes.
- Not bad.

1168
00:40:51,352 --> 00:40:53,392
- Over here, Jae Suk.
- He did it.

1169
00:40:53,522 --> 00:40:54,591
- He's done.
- Nice.

1170
00:40:54,592 --> 00:40:56,122
(7th try, Young Woo)

1171
00:40:56,322 --> 00:40:57,392
No.

1172
00:40:58,532 --> 00:41:00,162
(Failed)

1173
00:41:04,532 --> 00:41:07,802
(Failed with a single scream)

1174
00:41:10,472 --> 00:41:11,642
Oh, no.

1175
00:41:12,812 --> 00:41:13,942
I feel bad.

1176
00:41:16,682 --> 00:41:17,711
(Looking away)

1177
00:41:17,712 --> 00:41:19,512
Oh, no. I feel bad.

1178
00:41:20,282 --> 00:41:24,792
(Young Woo was confident in using his body.)

1179
00:41:25,122 --> 00:41:26,691
No, it's okay.

1180
00:41:26,692 --> 00:41:28,761
It's okay. Get up.

1181
00:41:28,762 --> 00:41:30,931
- It's okay.
- Get him a sleeveless shirt.

1182
00:41:30,932 --> 00:41:32,161
- Where is it?
- It's...

1183
00:41:32,162 --> 00:41:34,232
- His sleeves are too long.
- Come here, Young Woo.

1184
00:41:34,302 --> 00:41:35,432
A sleeveless shirt...

1185
00:41:35,862 --> 00:41:37,172
- Pull your sleeves up.
- Hey.

1186
00:41:37,672 --> 00:41:39,132
We're all the way in Seokgwan-dong.

1187
00:41:39,402 --> 00:41:41,572
- Right now...
- We're in Seokgwan-dong.

1188
00:41:42,202 --> 00:41:43,971
No, it's okay. You can do it.

1189
00:41:43,972 --> 00:41:45,772
- You can do it.
- You can do it.

1190
00:41:45,942 --> 00:41:47,542
- I almost got it.
- What?

1191
00:41:47,682 --> 00:41:49,811
- But out of the blue...
- We should calm down.

1192
00:41:49,812 --> 00:41:50,881
We're too impatient.

1193
00:41:50,882 --> 00:41:52,551
Let's cut down on the mistakes.

1194
00:41:52,552 --> 00:41:54,652
- Let's make fewer mistakes.
- We should succeed.

1195
00:41:54,752 --> 00:41:55,781
You can do it. You've got three tries.

1196
00:41:55,782 --> 00:41:56,862
- Let's go.
- Look further.

1197
00:41:56,922 --> 00:41:58,202
- Look further, okay?
- Come on.

1198
00:41:59,052 --> 00:42:00,861
Ready. Set.

1199
00:42:00,862 --> 00:42:02,492
- Stay calm.
- It's tough.

1200
00:42:02,722 --> 00:42:04,661
- You can do it.
- It's not easy.

1201
00:42:04,662 --> 00:42:05,691
- I've got it.
- Good.

1202
00:42:05,692 --> 00:42:07,061
(8th try, Si Ah)

1203
00:42:07,062 --> 00:42:08,262
- Bring it down.
- Start.

1204
00:42:08,532 --> 00:42:09,631
- Isn't it too...
- Down?

1205
00:42:09,632 --> 00:42:10,701
(8th try, Si Ah)

1206
00:42:10,702 --> 00:42:12,171
- Slowly.
- You can do it.

1207
00:42:12,172 --> 00:42:13,201
Slowly. Good.

1208
00:42:13,202 --> 00:42:14,471
- Rush to the starting line.
- Slowly.

1209
00:42:14,472 --> 00:42:16,242
- You've got it.
- Just a bit more.

1210
00:42:17,542 --> 00:42:18,642
- Just a bit more.
- Nice.

1211
00:42:19,072 --> 00:42:20,411
- Gently.
- Oh, dear.

1212
00:42:20,412 --> 00:42:21,742
- Gently.
- Gently.

1213
00:42:22,412 --> 00:42:23,451
Good.

1214
00:42:23,452 --> 00:42:24,452
(8th try, Jae Suk)

1215
00:42:24,453 --> 00:42:25,881
- Calm down.
- Slowly.

1216
00:42:25,882 --> 00:42:28,682
- Slowly.
- Slowly.

1217
00:42:29,452 --> 00:42:30,621
- You can do it.
- Nice.

1218
00:42:30,622 --> 00:42:31,792
He did it.

1219
00:42:32,352 --> 00:42:33,892
- Good.
- Here.

1220
00:42:34,292 --> 00:42:35,362
Here.

1221
00:42:35,862 --> 00:42:37,562
- Good.
- You can do it.

1222
00:42:38,692 --> 00:42:41,262
(You can do it!)

1223
00:42:41,362 --> 00:42:43,832
(Let's cut down on the mistakes.)

1224
00:42:44,332 --> 00:42:45,372
Here.

1225
00:42:45,972 --> 00:42:47,302
Good.

1226
00:42:47,772 --> 00:42:49,272
- You can do it.
- No.

1227
00:42:50,342 --> 00:42:54,382
(Failed)

1228
00:42:55,912 --> 00:42:57,012
You can do it.

1229
00:42:59,112 --> 00:43:01,681
(Everyone is stunned.)

1230
00:43:01,682 --> 00:43:02,952
Good grief.

1231
00:43:04,122 --> 00:43:05,991
- Gosh.
- He's really bad at it.

1232
00:43:05,992 --> 00:43:07,162
Seriously.

1233
00:43:09,562 --> 00:43:10,662
Goodness.

1234
00:43:13,502 --> 00:43:16,061
(A shocking play)

1235
00:43:16,062 --> 00:43:17,131
What...

1236
00:43:17,132 --> 00:43:18,332
(A shocking play)

1237
00:43:22,642 --> 00:43:23,741
At this rate...

1238
00:43:23,742 --> 00:43:24,871
(Getting emotional)

1239
00:43:24,872 --> 00:43:26,682
- Oh, dear.
- At this rate...

1240
00:43:27,012 --> 00:43:28,541
At this rate, it's like I'm doing it on purpose.

1241
00:43:28,542 --> 00:43:29,711
Si Ah! You're the X-Man.

1242
00:43:29,712 --> 00:43:30,881
- Hey.
- Isn't this "X-Man?"

1243
00:43:30,882 --> 00:43:31,982
- Young Woo.
- Oh, my.

1244
00:43:32,352 --> 00:43:33,352
At this rate,

1245
00:43:33,353 --> 00:43:34,958
- You...
- it's like I'm doing it on purpose.

1246
00:43:34,982 --> 00:43:36,621
Right now, you "have no idea."

1247
00:43:36,622 --> 00:43:39,022
- No, but...
- You really "have no idea."

1248
00:43:39,222 --> 00:43:40,761
- You have no thoughts, do you?
- Right now...

1249
00:43:40,762 --> 00:43:42,622
- He has no thoughts.
- How could you wear...

1250
00:43:42,862 --> 00:43:44,422
- How could you wear this?
- Young Woo.

1251
00:43:45,062 --> 00:43:48,362
- It's...
- "Have no idea?" For real?

1252
00:43:48,462 --> 00:43:49,631
This is just too much.

1253
00:43:49,632 --> 00:43:50,972
For goodness' sake.

1254
00:43:51,702 --> 00:43:52,732
Really.

1255
00:43:53,072 --> 00:43:54,102
It's coming back.

1256
00:43:54,372 --> 00:43:55,542
Really.

1257
00:43:56,812 --> 00:43:59,912
(Jumping out of rage)

1258
00:44:00,212 --> 00:44:01,281
- I'm sorry.
- Here.

1259
00:44:01,282 --> 00:44:02,442
- But...
- Don't get nervous.

1260
00:44:02,512 --> 00:44:03,851
It's okay because he's handsome, right?

1261
00:44:03,852 --> 00:44:04,881
- No.
- It's okay.

1262
00:44:04,882 --> 00:44:06,581
(Starting to not become okay)

1263
00:44:06,582 --> 00:44:07,652
It's okay.

1264
00:44:07,822 --> 00:44:09,882
I'm guessing we're making him feel overwhelmed.

1265
00:44:10,092 --> 00:44:12,622
- Let's quiet down.
- Let's not talk for a bit.

1266
00:44:13,092 --> 00:44:15,791
- Young Woo is like me.
- He has the jitters.

1267
00:44:15,792 --> 00:44:17,892
- I have the jitters.
- Go first.

1268
00:44:18,332 --> 00:44:19,391
- Yes.
- You go first.

1269
00:44:19,392 --> 00:44:20,832
- First?
- You go first.

1270
00:44:21,202 --> 00:44:22,462
Going first might be...

1271
00:44:22,802 --> 00:44:24,832
The ones going later feel more pressure.

1272
00:44:25,172 --> 00:44:27,072
- Going 1st...
- I'll go 1st.

1273
00:44:27,372 --> 00:44:28,902
- First. Okay.
- Now then...

1274
00:44:29,372 --> 00:44:31,571
- "ELDWT."
- "ELDWT."

1275
00:44:31,572 --> 00:44:32,972
- "ELDWT."
- "ELDWT."

1276
00:44:33,242 --> 00:44:34,341
You have an idea.

1277
00:44:34,342 --> 00:44:35,412
I have no idea.

1278
00:44:35,742 --> 00:44:37,252
What's with my T-shirt?

1279
00:44:38,282 --> 00:44:40,222
- How did you end up in that?
- I know, right?

1280
00:44:41,152 --> 00:44:42,281
Choo Young Woo!

1281
00:44:42,282 --> 00:44:43,592
- Relax.
- Okay.

1282
00:44:43,792 --> 00:44:45,022
I'm super nervous.

1283
00:44:45,192 --> 00:44:47,721
- It's okay.
- You can do it.

1284
00:44:47,722 --> 00:44:49,191
- Ready.
- Here we go.

1285
00:44:49,192 --> 00:44:50,991
- Okay.
- His face is pale.

1286
00:44:50,992 --> 00:44:52,431
Don't try too hard. Just do it.

1287
00:44:52,432 --> 00:44:54,431
(Out of 10 total tries, they're on try number 9.)

1288
00:44:54,432 --> 00:44:55,501
Set.

1289
00:44:55,502 --> 00:44:57,462
(Out of 10 total tries, they're on try number 9.)

1290
00:44:59,072 --> 00:45:00,171
(9th try, Young Woo)

1291
00:45:00,172 --> 00:45:02,402
- That's it.
- Slowly and calmly, Young Woo.

1292
00:45:03,042 --> 00:45:04,142
Yes.

1293
00:45:04,542 --> 00:45:05,672
- Okay.
- Nice.

1294
00:45:06,412 --> 00:45:07,511
- That's it.
- Turn.

1295
00:45:07,512 --> 00:45:08,641
- Yes.
- Good.

1296
00:45:08,642 --> 00:45:09,781
- Nice.
- Be careful not to hit it.

1297
00:45:09,782 --> 00:45:11,281
- Calmly.
- Good.

1298
00:45:11,282 --> 00:45:12,882
- You're done.
- Hit it just once.

1299
00:45:12,982 --> 00:45:14,151
- Nice.
- One more time.

1300
00:45:14,152 --> 00:45:15,682
- She got it.
- Okay.

1301
00:45:15,882 --> 00:45:16,952
- All set.
- Nice.

1302
00:45:16,992 --> 00:45:18,091
(Young Woo passes.)

1303
00:45:18,092 --> 00:45:20,291
(Choo Weak Link has done it.)

1304
00:45:20,292 --> 00:45:21,591
(9th try, Young Woo)

1305
00:45:21,592 --> 00:45:22,592
(9th try, Si Ah)

1306
00:45:22,593 --> 00:45:24,062
Si Ah.

1307
00:45:24,892 --> 00:45:26,292
- Good.
- Okay. That's good.

1308
00:45:26,902 --> 00:45:28,631
- Stall it.
- Great.

1309
00:45:28,632 --> 00:45:30,072
- Great.
- You're doing great.

1310
00:45:30,272 --> 00:45:33,441
You're doing great. That's good, Si Ah.

1311
00:45:33,442 --> 00:45:34,602
- Get it.
- Good.

1312
00:45:35,072 --> 00:45:36,241
All right.

1313
00:45:36,242 --> 00:45:37,742
(9th try, Jae Suk)

1314
00:45:40,912 --> 00:45:41,912
All right.

1315
00:45:44,312 --> 00:45:46,552
(Failed)

1316
00:45:46,682 --> 00:45:48,481
(I'm sorry.)

1317
00:45:48,482 --> 00:45:51,522
- It's all right.
- It's okay.

1318
00:45:56,022 --> 00:45:58,962
(The sinner came kneeling.)

1319
00:46:01,802 --> 00:46:06,332
(Their 9th try ended as if it was a dream.)

1320
00:46:07,442 --> 00:46:09,602
- It's too difficult.
- This is unpleasant.

1321
00:46:10,772 --> 00:46:12,472
- This is unpleasant.
- It's all right.

1322
00:46:14,782 --> 00:46:16,011
- I feel so bad.
- It's so hard.

1323
00:46:16,012 --> 00:46:17,952
- This isn't working.
- I know.

1324
00:46:18,882 --> 00:46:20,552
You're not leaving like this, are you?

1325
00:46:21,522 --> 00:46:22,822
You're not leaving.

1326
00:46:23,352 --> 00:46:25,521
It's Christmas. We should give them gifts.

1327
00:46:25,522 --> 00:46:27,792
Oh, please.

1328
00:46:27,962 --> 00:46:29,661
- It's their last try.
- It looks difficult.

1329
00:46:29,662 --> 00:46:31,291
(They have one last chance left.)

1330
00:46:31,292 --> 00:46:33,731
We're almost there.

1331
00:46:33,732 --> 00:46:35,262
Do you want to go first?

1332
00:46:35,532 --> 00:46:36,661
Should we go the other way?

1333
00:46:36,662 --> 00:46:37,771
(They carefully choose the order on their last try.)

1334
00:46:37,772 --> 00:46:39,132
But it's our last try!

1335
00:46:39,832 --> 00:46:42,541
Number 2, number 3, and number 4?

1336
00:46:42,542 --> 00:46:43,741
(Yeon Seok, Jae Suk, Si Ah, and Young Woo)

1337
00:46:43,742 --> 00:46:45,241
Let's try it that way.

1338
00:46:45,242 --> 00:46:46,841
- Young Woo, can you go last?
- You go last.

1339
00:46:46,842 --> 00:46:48,482
- I will.
- You can go last.

1340
00:46:48,582 --> 00:46:49,582
You're number three.

1341
00:46:49,942 --> 00:46:53,721
- Let's go!
- Let's go!

1342
00:46:53,722 --> 00:46:54,852
You can do this.

1343
00:46:56,122 --> 00:46:57,751
Taste the success.

1344
00:46:57,752 --> 00:47:01,191
Let's say a chant before we go. In 1, 2, 3.

1345
00:47:01,192 --> 00:47:02,261
- Here we go!
- Let's do this!

1346
00:47:02,262 --> 00:47:03,322
Here we go!

1347
00:47:03,532 --> 00:47:05,861
- You're going last.
- Last try, guys.

1348
00:47:05,862 --> 00:47:07,382
Going first is also a lot of pressure.

1349
00:47:07,702 --> 00:47:09,261
- Let's give it a go.
- Let's do it.

1350
00:47:09,262 --> 00:47:11,901
- It's nerve-racking either way.
- Yes. Let's pull this one off.

1351
00:47:11,902 --> 00:47:13,131
We go all the way.

1352
00:47:13,132 --> 00:47:15,118
(Out of 10 total tries, they're on their last try.)

1353
00:47:15,142 --> 00:47:18,571
(Will there be a Christmas miracle...)

1354
00:47:18,572 --> 00:47:20,441
(to give them dellvery app vouchers?)

1355
00:47:20,442 --> 00:47:23,142
- Here I go.
- Ready. Set.

1356
00:47:26,152 --> 00:47:27,222
Hey.

1357
00:47:30,452 --> 00:47:31,452
What?

1358
00:47:31,453 --> 00:47:32,821
(Last try, Yeon Seok)

1359
00:47:32,822 --> 00:47:34,292
(He saved it in a second.)

1360
00:47:36,762 --> 00:47:39,592
(Yeon Seok passed in 5 seconds.)

1361
00:47:40,132 --> 00:47:41,531
- He's fast.
- That's good.

1362
00:47:41,532 --> 00:47:42,832
Great.

1363
00:47:44,572 --> 00:47:45,671
(Last try, Yeon Seok)

1364
00:47:45,672 --> 00:47:48,701
(Last try, Jae Suk)

1365
00:47:48,702 --> 00:47:49,842
Jae Suk!

1366
00:47:50,612 --> 00:47:53,842
(Over)

1367
00:47:55,082 --> 00:47:57,912
Guys.

1368
00:47:58,052 --> 00:48:00,282
I didn't say, "Here I go."

1369
00:48:01,422 --> 00:48:03,722
Oh, no!

1370
00:48:04,152 --> 00:48:05,191
Oh, dear.

1371
00:48:05,192 --> 00:48:06,492
(Ms. Pyo is on the ground.)

1372
00:48:14,262 --> 00:48:15,462
Jae Suk!

1373
00:48:19,472 --> 00:48:22,101
Oh, no. Is it over?

1374
00:48:22,102 --> 00:48:23,872
I didn't say, "Here I go."

1375
00:48:25,042 --> 00:48:27,242
Did we say, "Here we go?"

1376
00:48:27,542 --> 00:48:30,951
So many times. We said it too many times.

1377
00:48:30,952 --> 00:48:32,051
That was...

1378
00:48:32,052 --> 00:48:33,551
She's taking it away.

1379
00:48:33,552 --> 00:48:34,552
(The voucher)

1380
00:48:34,553 --> 00:48:35,922
It's gone now.

1381
00:48:36,952 --> 00:48:38,721
- No!
- Oh, no.

1382
00:48:38,722 --> 00:48:41,191
- No!
- No!

1383
00:48:41,192 --> 00:48:42,392
(The sound of wailing echoes.)

1384
00:48:43,462 --> 00:48:45,792
You're a complete tool!

1385
00:48:46,632 --> 00:48:48,461
I told you this was my three years of misfortune.

1386
00:48:48,462 --> 00:48:49,661
(Yoo Jae Suk's wife)

1387
00:48:49,662 --> 00:48:50,972
I guess it really is.

1388
00:48:51,732 --> 00:48:53,271
It really is.

1389
00:48:53,272 --> 00:48:54,371
(Jae Suk's three years of misfortune)

1390
00:48:54,372 --> 00:48:55,602
How did I...

1391
00:48:56,272 --> 00:48:57,311
How did I...

1392
00:48:57,312 --> 00:49:00,281
- It's okay!
- It's okay!

1393
00:49:00,282 --> 00:49:03,481
- It's okay!
- It's okay!

1394
00:49:03,482 --> 00:49:04,711
I'm terribly sorry.

1395
00:49:04,712 --> 00:49:07,621
- That's okay.
- We're fine.

1396
00:49:07,622 --> 00:49:09,881
We should have given you the voucher, at least.

1397
00:49:09,882 --> 00:49:11,091
(Our merch instead of vouchers)

1398
00:49:11,092 --> 00:49:12,952
Merch!

1399
00:49:13,692 --> 00:49:16,221
I made a mistake at the most critical moment.

1400
00:49:16,222 --> 00:49:17,662
- So did I.
- We're sorry.

1401
00:49:17,792 --> 00:49:18,792
We're sorry.

1402
00:49:19,032 --> 00:49:20,302
We feel so bad.

1403
00:49:20,662 --> 00:49:21,962
It's fine.

1404
00:49:22,302 --> 00:49:24,901
(How was it being on Whenever Possible?)

1405
00:49:24,902 --> 00:49:26,231
Although I made a huge mistake,

1406
00:49:26,232 --> 00:49:28,942
it was nice and meaningful to spend time like this.

1407
00:49:29,272 --> 00:49:32,941
Let's keep dancing happily in this room.

1408
00:49:32,942 --> 00:49:35,312
- Happy dancing!
- Happy dancing!

1409
00:49:35,582 --> 00:49:36,811
As long as you're handsome,

1410
00:49:36,812 --> 00:49:39,512
- it's okay!
- It's okay!

1411
00:49:40,552 --> 00:49:42,582
- Thank you.
- You even got a hole in your sock.

1412
00:49:43,052 --> 00:49:44,721
- It's from sliding earlier.
- I know.

1413
00:49:44,722 --> 00:49:46,522
- You have a hole.
- I got a hole in my sock.

1414
00:49:46,652 --> 00:49:48,412
- He's got a hole in his sock.
- I really...

1415
00:49:48,792 --> 00:49:51,362
- He played too hard.
- That's how hard I played.

1416
00:49:53,432 --> 00:49:54,961
He gave it his all.

1417
00:49:54,962 --> 00:49:57,072
- Exactly.
- Is this right?

1418
00:49:57,632 --> 00:49:59,001
You got a hole in your sock?

1419
00:49:59,002 --> 00:50:00,002
(He leaves with a hole in his sock.)

1420
00:50:00,003 --> 00:50:02,371
- I did my best today.
- Thank you!

1421
00:50:02,372 --> 00:50:04,212
- Great job.
- Goodbye.

1422
00:50:04,512 --> 00:50:06,041
(Sighing)

1423
00:50:06,042 --> 00:50:07,582
The last one!

1424
00:50:08,542 --> 00:50:11,052
(He exits with a cry.)

1425
00:50:14,722 --> 00:50:15,781
I'm sorry.

1426
00:50:15,782 --> 00:50:17,521
- No.
- No, we're sorry.

1427
00:50:17,522 --> 00:50:19,092
We...

1428
00:50:19,452 --> 00:50:22,261
It was a mess overall.

1429
00:50:22,262 --> 00:50:23,322
I agree.

1430
00:50:23,892 --> 00:50:24,892
(Choo Weak Link is ashamed.)

1431
00:50:24,893 --> 00:50:26,491
- I...
- Young Woo.

1432
00:50:26,492 --> 00:50:27,661
- Yes?
- I'm sorry.

1433
00:50:27,662 --> 00:50:28,802
No, I'm sorry.

1434
00:50:29,302 --> 00:50:30,302
But...

1435
00:50:30,902 --> 00:50:32,571
when I failed on our last try,

1436
00:50:32,572 --> 00:50:34,042
I saw you with a subtle smile.

1437
00:50:34,472 --> 00:50:35,472
(Laughing)

1438
00:50:36,102 --> 00:50:38,041
- Did I see it correctly?
- Were you relieved?

1439
00:50:38,042 --> 00:50:39,541
- That's not it.
- I turned around, and...

1440
00:50:39,542 --> 00:50:40,862
That's not what that smile meant.

1441
00:50:41,012 --> 00:50:42,141
- That wasn't it.
- You...

1442
00:50:42,142 --> 00:50:43,611
It looked like he was hoping it wouldn't come to him.

1443
00:50:43,612 --> 00:50:45,211
Was it a sigh of relief? What was it?

1444
00:50:45,212 --> 00:50:46,411
I was all tense, and...

1445
00:50:46,412 --> 00:50:47,952
(Laughing)

1446
00:50:48,322 --> 00:50:49,851
- I...
- You seem so glad.

1447
00:50:49,852 --> 00:50:52,651
- saw him.
- You took all the blame...

1448
00:50:52,652 --> 00:50:54,522
for his mistakes.

1449
00:50:54,592 --> 00:50:55,892
It's a misunderstanding.

1450
00:50:55,962 --> 00:50:58,161
Let's get some good food and cheer up.

1451
00:50:58,162 --> 00:51:00,062
- We should get a grip.
- Absolutely.

1452
00:51:00,192 --> 00:51:02,161
- In the end...
- Jeez.

1453
00:51:02,162 --> 00:51:03,162
(They'll eat during the 2-hour break.)

1454
00:51:03,163 --> 00:51:04,723
- I feel...
- I was doing okay, though.

1455
00:51:04,832 --> 00:51:06,701
- ashamed, Si Ah.
- I must have been impatient.

1456
00:51:06,702 --> 00:51:07,841
No, don't say that.

1457
00:51:07,842 --> 00:51:09,101
Let's do well in the next one.

1458
00:51:09,102 --> 00:51:11,072
- You were doing okay too.
- I'm also ashamed.

1459
00:51:11,112 --> 00:51:12,471
- But...
- Are we going right?

1460
00:51:12,472 --> 00:51:14,711
Did it fall because it hit my pants?

1461
00:51:14,712 --> 00:51:16,081
- What?
- Earlier.

1462
00:51:16,082 --> 00:51:18,481
- Did it hit my pants?
- It was your top.

1463
00:51:18,482 --> 00:51:20,422
- What is it?
- I'm just bummed.

1464
00:51:21,052 --> 00:51:23,021
- It's a bummer.
- I'm analyzing...

1465
00:51:23,022 --> 00:51:24,051
the cause of defeat so that I can...

1466
00:51:24,052 --> 00:51:25,732
- It is a bummer.
- play better next time.

1467
00:51:26,752 --> 00:51:29,462
- Is it this way?
- It must be across the street.

1468
00:51:30,092 --> 00:51:32,891
Is there a good restaurant nearby?

1469
00:51:32,892 --> 00:51:34,431
There's a place where people line up.

1470
00:51:34,432 --> 00:51:35,901
What do they serve?

1471
00:51:35,902 --> 00:51:37,231
- Frozen pork belly.
- Pork.

1472
00:51:37,232 --> 00:51:38,301
- Frozen pork belly.
- Frozen pork belly.

1473
00:51:38,302 --> 00:51:40,101
- And beef brisket.
- Beef brisket?

1474
00:51:40,102 --> 00:51:41,441
It's across the street.

1475
00:51:41,442 --> 00:51:42,571
- Across the street?
- Yes.

1476
00:51:42,572 --> 00:51:44,941
But if you think a barbecue is too heavy,

1477
00:51:44,942 --> 00:51:46,711
there's an anchovy broth noodles place.

1478
00:51:46,712 --> 00:51:49,181
You'll see it when you go out the side gate.

1479
00:51:49,182 --> 00:51:51,181
- Great.
- She said it was at the side gate.

1480
00:51:51,182 --> 00:51:52,911
- She told us...
- I think it's this way.

1481
00:51:52,912 --> 00:51:54,922
To go out the side gate.

1482
00:51:55,482 --> 00:51:57,292
(The side gate)

1483
00:51:57,422 --> 00:51:58,792
This neighborhood is...

1484
00:51:59,192 --> 00:52:00,352
so quaint.

1485
00:52:00,792 --> 00:52:03,091
This frozen pork belly place is really famous.

1486
00:52:03,092 --> 00:52:04,131
- Yes.
- It is?

1487
00:52:04,132 --> 00:52:05,932
It's so famous.

1488
00:52:06,062 --> 00:52:07,632
But she said we had to wait in line.

1489
00:52:08,702 --> 00:52:12,632
Beef brisket and beef tripe hot pot!

1490
00:52:13,942 --> 00:52:16,302
(They instantly respond to tripe.)

1491
00:52:16,502 --> 00:52:18,972
Do you want to wait there before they open?

1492
00:52:19,312 --> 00:52:20,941
- Where?
- The tripe place.

1493
00:52:20,942 --> 00:52:22,041
It opens at noon?

1494
00:52:22,042 --> 00:52:24,452
But we waited in line last time.

1495
00:52:25,082 --> 00:52:27,582
They sell beef tripe, which is Si Ah's favorite.

1496
00:52:27,682 --> 00:52:29,851
I'll go wherever you go.

1497
00:52:29,852 --> 00:52:31,392
He doesn't want to wait in line.

1498
00:52:31,552 --> 00:52:32,621
(Correct)

1499
00:52:32,622 --> 00:52:33,761
I don't think he wants to wait.

1500
00:52:33,762 --> 00:52:36,691
- It opens at noon, - You don't like waiting, do you?

1501
00:52:36,692 --> 00:52:37,931
- It's not that.
- so we won't have to wait in line.

1502
00:52:37,932 --> 00:52:38,961
- Really?
- Yes.

1503
00:52:38,962 --> 00:52:41,032
Guys, let's go there.

1504
00:52:41,262 --> 00:52:45,101
Young Woo is acting nonchalant,

1505
00:52:45,102 --> 00:52:46,902
but he's even got a hole in his sock.

1506
00:52:47,142 --> 00:52:48,841
- He's losing it.
- This way.

1507
00:52:48,842 --> 00:52:51,411
He's mentally devastated.

1508
00:52:51,412 --> 00:52:53,672
- He needs to cheer up.
- Yes.

1509
00:52:54,342 --> 00:52:55,381
Let's eat...

1510
00:52:55,382 --> 00:52:56,741
(They head to the frozen pork belly place.)

1511
00:52:56,742 --> 00:52:57,912
and cheer up.

1512
00:52:58,512 --> 00:53:00,821
- Let's win next time.
- Yes, let's win next time.

1513
00:53:00,822 --> 00:53:02,621
- It's Christmas, Jae Suk.
- I know.

1514
00:53:02,622 --> 00:53:03,821
- This is...
- Oh, no.

1515
00:53:03,822 --> 00:53:05,551
- You're right.
- We need to get them presents.

1516
00:53:05,552 --> 00:53:08,162
- It'll be Christmas when this airs.
- Yes.

1517
00:53:08,462 --> 00:53:10,592
- This is...
- Should we buy some gifts?

1518
00:53:11,862 --> 00:53:14,161
- In case we fail?
- In case we fail.

1519
00:53:14,162 --> 00:53:16,561
Her channel is Pyo Teacher Dance.

1520
00:53:16,562 --> 00:53:18,471
- Let's like and subscribe.
- Pyo Teacher Dance?

1521
00:53:18,472 --> 00:53:20,192
- Like and subscribe.
- Like and subscribe.

1522
00:53:20,972 --> 00:53:22,502
I wish I could go to a bathhouse.

1523
00:53:22,972 --> 00:53:24,972
- Do you like going to bathhouses?
- I do.

1524
00:53:25,042 --> 00:53:26,271
- So do I.
- Do you?

1525
00:53:26,272 --> 00:53:27,742
I like saunas.

1526
00:53:28,382 --> 00:53:29,542
I love bathhouses.

1527
00:53:29,912 --> 00:53:32,052
You can't go to a sauna anymore, can you?

1528
00:53:32,512 --> 00:53:34,081
- I still do.
- Really?

1529
00:53:34,082 --> 00:53:35,851
I just sit there...

1530
00:53:35,852 --> 00:53:37,052
awkwardly.

1531
00:53:38,292 --> 00:53:40,392
- While laughing awkwardly?
- Yes.

1532
00:53:40,492 --> 00:53:41,621
Do you have any siblings?

1533
00:53:41,622 --> 00:53:42,662
I'm an only child.

1534
00:53:43,592 --> 00:53:44,991
Oh, you are. What about you, Young Woo?

1535
00:53:44,992 --> 00:53:46,732
- Young Woo...
- I have a younger brother.

1536
00:53:46,962 --> 00:53:47,962
(Actor Cha Jung Woo, Young Woo's little brother)

1537
00:53:47,963 --> 00:53:49,201
Is he also tall?

1538
00:53:49,202 --> 00:53:51,271
Yes. He's pretty tall.

1539
00:53:51,272 --> 00:53:52,701
Are your parents tall?

1540
00:53:52,702 --> 00:53:55,301
- Yes, my parents are tall.
- Both of them?

1541
00:53:55,302 --> 00:53:57,171
- I'm the shortest male.
- Seriously?

1542
00:53:57,172 --> 00:53:58,241
- In the family, yes.
- Really?

1543
00:53:58,242 --> 00:54:00,211
- Your father is taller than you?
- He's slightly taller.

1544
00:54:00,212 --> 00:54:01,611
- Really?
- How tall is he?

1545
00:54:01,612 --> 00:54:03,381
- He's around 187cm.
- Is he 190cm?

1546
00:54:03,382 --> 00:54:04,551
He's 187cm?

1547
00:54:04,552 --> 00:54:05,681
He really is tall.

1548
00:54:05,682 --> 00:54:06,751
(His father was a model in the 1990s.)

1549
00:54:06,752 --> 00:54:07,952
This is the place.

1550
00:54:09,052 --> 00:54:10,151
(They arrive at the place recommended by the Whenever Guest.)

1551
00:54:10,152 --> 00:54:11,422
The smell!

1552
00:54:12,122 --> 00:54:13,591
- This is...
- It's not that big.

1553
00:54:13,592 --> 00:54:15,722
(It's currently 11:34am.)

1554
00:54:16,592 --> 00:54:17,761
What? But...

1555
00:54:17,762 --> 00:54:19,731
(They're still getting ready to open.)

1556
00:54:19,732 --> 00:54:21,372
- The seats are...
- Are there any seats?

1557
00:54:21,532 --> 00:54:23,601
- It looks like...
- How are they placed?

1558
00:54:23,602 --> 00:54:24,731
Let's see.

1559
00:54:24,732 --> 00:54:26,271
- Hold on. First...
- Wait.

1560
00:54:26,272 --> 00:54:27,801
- Should we put our names?
- Yes.

1561
00:54:27,802 --> 00:54:29,871
(There's no one on the waitlist yet.)

1562
00:54:29,872 --> 00:54:31,671
- We must be that one party.
- Yes.

1563
00:54:31,672 --> 00:54:33,742
- Right?
- It's us.

1564
00:54:34,012 --> 00:54:36,281
(That means we got here first.)

1565
00:54:36,282 --> 00:54:38,781
- We're door-busting for lunch.
- Because of Ahn Yeon Seok...

1566
00:54:38,782 --> 00:54:39,782
(They're waiting for the 2nd time in Episode 2.)

1567
00:54:39,783 --> 00:54:41,921
- We're door-busting.
- I usually don't wait in line.

1568
00:54:41,922 --> 00:54:43,621
But Si Ah likes beef tripe.

1569
00:54:43,622 --> 00:54:45,222
I'm okay if we don't eat it, though.

1570
00:54:46,152 --> 00:54:48,122
After some beef brisket and beef tripe...

1571
00:54:48,422 --> 00:54:49,961
- It does sound delicious.
- I'm so stressed out...

1572
00:54:49,962 --> 00:54:51,922
- because of one gourmet.
- I bet it's delicious.

1573
00:54:51,962 --> 00:54:52,962
- Beef tripe sounds good.
- Who?

1574
00:54:52,963 --> 00:54:54,138
- It sounds tasty.
- Who's the gourmet?

1575
00:54:54,162 --> 00:54:55,801
- And some fried rice.
- I love it.

1576
00:54:55,802 --> 00:54:57,831
- It must be good.
- It does sound good.

1577
00:54:57,832 --> 00:54:58,912
They also serve naengmyeon.

1578
00:54:59,572 --> 00:55:01,972
Should we wait in the coffee shop next door?

1579
00:55:02,172 --> 00:55:03,671
- Should we?
- It's cold out.

1580
00:55:03,672 --> 00:55:05,471
- That's better.
- There's a bakery.

1581
00:55:05,472 --> 00:55:07,071
Oh, since we have our names on the list?

1582
00:55:07,072 --> 00:55:09,041
Exactly. We already put our names up.

1583
00:55:09,042 --> 00:55:10,281
(They're seated after ordering coffee.)

1584
00:55:10,282 --> 00:55:13,012
I thought about that in terms of costs.

1585
00:55:13,382 --> 00:55:15,851
I also like eating tasty food at a good restaurant.

1586
00:55:15,852 --> 00:55:17,421
Well, obviously, I like coming to coffee shops too.

1587
00:55:17,422 --> 00:55:19,452
But we came to a coffee shop to wait for that.

1588
00:55:19,822 --> 00:55:22,722
That leads to extra costs. I was thinking about that.

1589
00:55:22,792 --> 00:55:24,792
I'm not the type to wait in line for a restaurant.

1590
00:55:25,962 --> 00:55:27,442
That thing above your head is pretty.

1591
00:55:28,802 --> 00:55:31,071
(They spot a Christmas-themed music box.)

1592
00:55:31,072 --> 00:55:32,772
I think Christmas is...

1593
00:55:34,002 --> 00:55:35,202
really nice.

1594
00:55:36,372 --> 00:55:37,542
What's nice about it?

1595
00:55:39,342 --> 00:55:41,011
- I was just trying...
- I never thought about that.

1596
00:55:41,012 --> 00:55:42,512
To keep the conversation going.

1597
00:55:43,842 --> 00:55:46,681
(An aspiring talk show host appears out of nowhere.)

1598
00:55:46,682 --> 00:55:48,552
I'll tell you what's nice about it.

1599
00:55:48,822 --> 00:55:51,952
(The blender whirs.)

1600
00:55:52,022 --> 00:55:53,621
- We'll talk later.
- Okay.

1601
00:55:53,622 --> 00:55:55,662
- Thank you.
- That looks good.

1602
00:55:55,722 --> 00:55:57,591
- Thank you.
- Is it my birthday today?

1603
00:55:57,592 --> 00:55:58,731
(They ordered a lot with Jae Suk's card.)

1604
00:55:58,732 --> 00:56:00,491
- Is this my birthday party?
- Congratulations.

1605
00:56:00,492 --> 00:56:01,702
Thank you.

1606
00:56:02,332 --> 00:56:03,832
This is an appetizer.

1607
00:56:04,072 --> 00:56:05,072
Sure.

1608
00:56:05,232 --> 00:56:06,901
- It's good.
- It is good.

1609
00:56:06,902 --> 00:56:09,241
(A rare sight of eating bread while waiting for frozen pork belly)

1610
00:56:09,242 --> 00:56:10,972
- It's so good.
- It's warm.

1611
00:56:11,572 --> 00:56:14,011
- What movie did you watch recently?
- I watched "Zootopia 2."

1612
00:56:14,012 --> 00:56:16,482
- So did I. The most recent one.
- Yes.

1613
00:56:17,112 --> 00:56:18,411
- My name...
- They open everything.

1614
00:56:18,412 --> 00:56:19,952
- They're open.
- Are they?

1615
00:56:20,582 --> 00:56:21,651
- Thank you, ma'am.
- Thank you.

1616
00:56:21,652 --> 00:56:23,621
- Goodbye!
- Thank you!

1617
00:56:23,622 --> 00:56:25,168
(They move to the frozen pork belly place.)

1618
00:56:25,192 --> 00:56:27,361
All right, then. Let's head to the restaurant.

1619
00:56:27,362 --> 00:56:28,491
- Yes.
- Round Two.

1620
00:56:28,492 --> 00:56:29,691
- Round Two.
- Right on time.

1621
00:56:29,692 --> 00:56:31,232
- Gosh.
- Round Two!

1622
00:56:31,392 --> 00:56:32,432
Good.

1623
00:56:33,062 --> 00:56:34,361
It's nice.

1624
00:56:34,362 --> 00:56:36,002
It already smells delicious.

1625
00:56:36,102 --> 00:56:37,472
Goodness.

1626
00:56:37,702 --> 00:56:39,972
- I bet it's tasty.
- Now that we're here...

1627
00:56:40,872 --> 00:56:42,942
It's good that we came here.

1628
00:56:43,172 --> 00:56:44,311
(Laughing)

1629
00:56:44,312 --> 00:56:47,341
We have to order two or more servings...

1630
00:56:47,342 --> 00:56:48,781
- of beef tripe hot pot.
- Yes.

1631
00:56:48,782 --> 00:56:50,041
- Let's try that.
- Just two?

1632
00:56:50,042 --> 00:56:51,528
- Let's try the beef tripe hot pot.
- Two servings of that.

1633
00:56:51,552 --> 00:56:55,422
Si Ah likes pork belly too.

1634
00:56:55,582 --> 00:56:57,422
Can you eat a lot?

1635
00:56:58,322 --> 00:57:00,291
- You've got us.
- Me?

1636
00:57:00,292 --> 00:57:02,161
- We can finish it.
- Right.

1637
00:57:02,162 --> 00:57:03,491
- Then...
- What about you guys?

1638
00:57:03,492 --> 00:57:04,691
Two briskets and two pork bellies?

1639
00:57:04,692 --> 00:57:05,731
- Sure.
- Two briskets and two pork bellies.

1640
00:57:05,732 --> 00:57:06,732
(Pleased)

1641
00:57:06,733 --> 00:57:08,431
Do you want to place the hot pot or the meat...

1642
00:57:08,432 --> 00:57:10,062
in front of you?

1643
00:57:10,602 --> 00:57:12,631
Oh, are we boiling the hot pot on our table?

1644
00:57:12,632 --> 00:57:13,872
- I see.
- I see.

1645
00:57:14,372 --> 00:57:17,872
I see. We can't put both here.

1646
00:57:18,912 --> 00:57:21,841
- Could you boil the hot pot for us?
- Sure.

1647
00:57:21,842 --> 00:57:23,141
- Okay.
- Good.

1648
00:57:23,142 --> 00:57:25,111
- Goodness.
- You solved it.

1649
00:57:25,112 --> 00:57:27,722
- That was...
- We were so torn.

1650
00:57:28,252 --> 00:57:30,022
I'm pretty quick when it comes to food.

1651
00:57:30,582 --> 00:57:31,591
(Clever)

1652
00:57:31,592 --> 00:57:33,851
- You're smart.
- I never thought about that,

1653
00:57:33,852 --> 00:57:35,691
- and she just fixed it.
- By asking them to boil it first.

1654
00:57:35,692 --> 00:57:37,792
I was in a panic, to be honest.

1655
00:57:39,032 --> 00:57:40,932
"Should we split them?"

1656
00:57:41,532 --> 00:57:43,732
She knows because she's eaten hot pots a lot.

1657
00:57:44,072 --> 00:57:45,772
Young Woo, your shirt today is...

1658
00:57:46,102 --> 00:57:48,672
- "I have no idea?"
- I have no idea.

1659
00:57:50,542 --> 00:57:53,072
You looked like it earlier because of that sweatshirt.

1660
00:57:53,572 --> 00:57:56,112
I wish I could erase this part.

1661
00:57:56,182 --> 00:57:57,411
- "I have idea."
- "I have idea."

1662
00:57:57,412 --> 00:57:59,882
Should I erase it before the next game?

1663
00:58:02,022 --> 00:58:04,652
If "The Witch 2" was your debut movie, when was it?

1664
00:58:05,192 --> 00:58:08,862
I counted the years, and it's been four years.

1665
00:58:09,022 --> 00:58:10,792
That was pretty recent.

1666
00:58:10,892 --> 00:58:14,031
I made my debut in 2020.

1667
00:58:14,032 --> 00:58:15,531
- In 2020.
- It's been 5 years.

1668
00:58:15,532 --> 00:58:16,772
So, it's been about five years.

1669
00:58:17,672 --> 00:58:18,832
Has it been 30 years for you?

1670
00:58:19,172 --> 00:58:21,642
I debuted in 1991, so around 34 years.

1671
00:58:21,702 --> 00:58:22,742
Goodness.

1672
00:58:23,742 --> 00:58:24,812
It's a lot, right?

1673
00:58:25,812 --> 00:58:28,282
- For Yeon Seok, it's been...
- It's been 22 years.

1674
00:58:28,482 --> 00:58:31,052
(It's his 22nd year.)

1675
00:58:31,112 --> 00:58:32,712
You're also 22 years old.

1676
00:58:32,952 --> 00:58:35,282
- Thirty-four...
- Yeon Seok is also...

1677
00:58:36,052 --> 00:58:37,692
You're practically a mountain spirit now.

1678
00:58:37,822 --> 00:58:39,721
But you've been in this industry for 34 years.

1679
00:58:39,722 --> 00:58:42,061
Well, I'm the senior mountain spirit.

1680
00:58:42,062 --> 00:58:43,892
- Are you the Cabbage Sage?
- Yes.

1681
00:58:44,192 --> 00:58:45,392
And you're the Radish Sage.

1682
00:58:47,932 --> 00:58:49,001
(Glancing)

1683
00:58:49,002 --> 00:58:50,401
You don't know about Cabbage Sage and Radish Sage?

1684
00:58:50,402 --> 00:58:52,072
- I do.
- Okay.

1685
00:58:52,232 --> 00:58:54,201
I watched it when I was little.

1686
00:58:54,202 --> 00:58:55,802
You must feel cold.

1687
00:58:56,402 --> 00:58:58,072
"I have no idea."

1688
00:58:58,242 --> 00:58:59,712
Wear your jacket.

1689
00:58:59,972 --> 00:59:02,011
- You should...
- That would be too packed.

1690
00:59:02,012 --> 00:59:03,258
(Choo Weak Link seems colder than usual.)

1691
00:59:03,282 --> 00:59:05,182
Thank you.

1692
00:59:06,182 --> 00:59:07,482
Can we get one more?

1693
00:59:07,582 --> 00:59:09,722
No, this is fine. Oh, that's cold.

1694
00:59:09,752 --> 00:59:10,822
I'll do it for you.

1695
00:59:10,992 --> 00:59:12,091
- Sure.
- Have we all been in medical shows?

1696
00:59:12,092 --> 00:59:13,321
You're a troubleshooter.

1697
00:59:13,322 --> 00:59:14,322
You're right.

1698
00:59:14,323 --> 00:59:15,938
You were on "The Trauma Code: Heroes on Call."

1699
00:59:15,962 --> 00:59:17,162
And she was on that show.

1700
00:59:17,422 --> 00:59:19,032
Why did you suddenly clink glasses?

1701
00:59:19,432 --> 00:59:21,201
- I just...
- There was nothing in the cup.

1702
00:59:21,202 --> 00:59:22,962
- You called me a troubleshooter.
- You are.

1703
00:59:23,062 --> 00:59:24,731
I did it to express my gratitude.

1704
00:59:24,732 --> 00:59:27,572
She solves problems like it's nothing.

1705
00:59:28,572 --> 00:59:29,841
She's very easy-going.

1706
00:59:29,842 --> 00:59:31,942
I was going to speak, and you clinked glasses.

1707
00:59:32,142 --> 00:59:33,441
Your food is here.

1708
00:59:33,442 --> 00:59:35,011
(Their meat arrives.)

1709
00:59:35,012 --> 00:59:36,532
- That's beef brisket.
- Beef brisket.

1710
00:59:36,712 --> 00:59:38,011
(Beef brisket)

1711
00:59:38,012 --> 00:59:39,282
Thank you.

1712
00:59:39,312 --> 00:59:40,922
- It looks good.
- Should we try...

1713
00:59:41,052 --> 00:59:42,221
- Enjoy your food.
- the beef brisket first?

1714
00:59:42,222 --> 00:59:43,222
- Anything.
- Yes.

1715
00:59:43,223 --> 00:59:44,391
- Beef brisket first.
- Right?

1716
00:59:44,392 --> 00:59:45,721
- Would you like that?
- It's been so long since...

1717
00:59:45,722 --> 00:59:47,491
Si Ah says we should eat the beef brisket first.

1718
00:59:47,492 --> 00:59:49,221
- Should we?
- You eat the expensive one first.

1719
00:59:49,222 --> 00:59:50,931
- Oh, I see.
- I see.

1720
00:59:50,932 --> 00:59:52,561
There's a certain order.

1721
00:59:52,562 --> 00:59:54,201
- The sauce...
- Beef brisket...

1722
00:59:54,202 --> 00:59:55,461
Wait. Don't put all of them.

1723
00:59:55,462 --> 00:59:57,302
- Why not?
- They didn't serve everything yet.

1724
00:59:58,072 --> 00:59:59,571
Oh, right. There's no dipping sauce.

1725
00:59:59,572 --> 01:00:00,872
We don't have anything else.

1726
01:00:01,272 --> 01:00:03,342
- We try the natural taste of meat.
- Indeed.

1727
01:00:03,372 --> 01:00:04,641
Let's have one piece each.

1728
01:00:04,642 --> 01:00:06,442
- You were hungry, weren't you?
- Not at all.

1729
01:00:07,112 --> 01:00:09,342
Young Woo, you're cold and hungry, aren't you?

1730
01:00:09,942 --> 01:00:11,212
You're starving, right?

1731
01:00:11,552 --> 01:00:12,682
No.

1732
01:00:13,312 --> 01:00:15,252
I feel like you'll pass out once you get home.

1733
01:00:15,682 --> 01:00:17,382
- Young Woo.
- I can't go home like this.

1734
01:00:18,592 --> 01:00:21,122
- Gosh, that looks great.
- Look at that.

1735
01:00:23,722 --> 01:00:27,261
You normally dip beef brisket in soy sauce or salted sesame oil.

1736
01:00:27,262 --> 01:00:28,932
Which one do you prefer?

1737
01:00:29,802 --> 01:00:31,872
You've got lots of questions.

1738
01:00:33,802 --> 01:00:36,141
I prefer soy sauce.

1739
01:00:36,142 --> 01:00:37,142
- I see.
- Yes.

1740
01:00:37,143 --> 01:00:38,471
I was told it was better to speak more on shows.

1741
01:00:38,472 --> 01:00:40,112
- It is better.
- Yes.

1742
01:00:40,142 --> 01:00:41,881
(The rookie talk show host is enthusiastic.)

1743
01:00:41,882 --> 01:00:43,142
Their sauce is...

1744
01:00:43,212 --> 01:00:45,132
- Look at that.
- Should I add the bean sprouts?

1745
01:00:45,482 --> 01:00:47,412
- Yes, on the bottom.
- I'll place them.

1746
01:00:48,322 --> 01:00:50,752
We have to try it right away.

1747
01:00:50,782 --> 01:00:53,191
Yes, the younger ones should grill them.

1748
01:00:53,192 --> 01:00:54,261
- Sure.
- Okay.

1749
01:00:54,262 --> 01:00:55,621
I like grilling meat.

1750
01:00:55,622 --> 01:00:57,262
- The juniors will take it.
- Yes.

1751
01:00:57,832 --> 01:01:00,591
(The Cabbage Sage takes the first bite.)

1752
01:01:00,592 --> 01:01:01,862
- It's good.
- Beef brisket.

1753
01:01:01,962 --> 01:01:03,162
- Si Ah, try it.
- Okay.

1754
01:01:03,302 --> 01:01:04,422
- Young Woo, try it.
- Okay.

1755
01:01:05,672 --> 01:01:06,831
The sauce is really good.

1756
01:01:06,832 --> 01:01:08,902
(Trying one in the special sauce)

1757
01:01:09,272 --> 01:01:11,041
(This surely is a good restaurant.)

1758
01:01:11,042 --> 01:01:12,042
Thank you for the food.

1759
01:01:12,043 --> 01:01:13,512
(I told you so.)

1760
01:01:13,642 --> 01:01:15,542
We made the right decision to come here.

1761
01:01:15,882 --> 01:01:17,311
(Moaning)

1762
01:01:17,312 --> 01:01:18,912
We made the right decision to come here.

1763
01:01:19,712 --> 01:01:21,982
(Si Ah's long-awaited first bite)

1764
01:01:26,222 --> 01:01:27,691
It's so savory. Try it.

1765
01:01:27,692 --> 01:01:28,721
- Yes.
- It's tasty.

1766
01:01:28,722 --> 01:01:30,222
Gosh.

1767
01:01:30,892 --> 01:01:32,592
This is how you're supposed to eat it.

1768
01:01:33,632 --> 01:01:34,761
Eat up.

1769
01:01:34,762 --> 01:01:38,402
(It goes perfectly with grilled kimchi.)

1770
01:01:40,032 --> 01:01:41,042
It's scrumptious.

1771
01:01:42,902 --> 01:01:43,942
(Moaning)

1772
01:01:44,002 --> 01:01:46,011
I haven't had frozen pork belly in so long. It's so good.

1773
01:01:46,012 --> 01:01:47,272
This must be their main item.

1774
01:01:47,842 --> 01:01:49,842
- This is...
- How does it taste?

1775
01:01:50,412 --> 01:01:51,652
It's so delicious.

1776
01:01:52,282 --> 01:01:54,482
(Tying her hair)

1777
01:01:56,052 --> 01:01:57,251
Si Ah just tied her hair.

1778
01:01:57,252 --> 01:01:58,321
I'm going to...

1779
01:01:58,322 --> 01:02:00,251
- Oh, good.
- She's going to eat properly now.

1780
01:02:00,252 --> 01:02:01,462
I should focus.

1781
01:02:01,522 --> 01:02:02,892
You should pay today.

1782
01:02:02,992 --> 01:02:04,022
I see.

1783
01:02:04,292 --> 01:02:05,692
(Blowing)

1784
01:02:09,902 --> 01:02:13,472
(She eats her favorite food non-stop.)

1785
01:02:14,032 --> 01:02:15,402
(Nodding)

1786
01:02:15,572 --> 01:02:16,642
It's so delicious.

1787
01:02:18,142 --> 01:02:19,812
We're eating just like Si Ah said.

1788
01:02:20,372 --> 01:02:22,041
I'm so happy. Thank you.

1789
01:02:22,042 --> 01:02:23,781
We finished it in no time.

1790
01:02:23,782 --> 01:02:25,611
(The 2 beef briskets and 2 pork bellies are already gone.)

1791
01:02:25,612 --> 01:02:27,151
They could just boil the hot pot here.

1792
01:02:27,152 --> 01:02:28,522
Oh, you're right.

1793
01:02:28,922 --> 01:02:30,181
- Sir.
- Yes.

1794
01:02:30,182 --> 01:02:31,791
We already finished our meat.

1795
01:02:31,792 --> 01:02:33,021
- Can I eat this?
- You could just...

1796
01:02:33,022 --> 01:02:34,762
- put the hot pot here.
- You can.

1797
01:02:34,922 --> 01:02:36,321
- Sure.
- Without the grill.

1798
01:02:36,322 --> 01:02:37,661
(Finishing the last piece)

1799
01:02:37,662 --> 01:02:39,732
While we wait for the hot pot,

1800
01:02:40,432 --> 01:02:41,872
should we play a game for the check?

1801
01:02:42,032 --> 01:02:43,632
- Sure.
- Sure.

1802
01:02:44,502 --> 01:02:46,171
We grab lettuce...

1803
01:02:46,172 --> 01:02:47,371
(Hold each end of the lettuce and pull.)

1804
01:02:47,372 --> 01:02:48,742
We grab one side each.

1805
01:02:48,972 --> 01:02:50,072
The one that rips?

1806
01:02:50,142 --> 01:02:51,888
- You rip it, - The one with a bigger piece?

1807
01:02:51,912 --> 01:02:53,512
And the one with the biggest piece pays?

1808
01:02:53,842 --> 01:02:55,612
Sure. Will you go first?

1809
01:02:56,012 --> 01:02:57,181
Can I check the lettuce?

1810
01:02:57,182 --> 01:02:59,311
No, not for too long.

1811
01:02:59,312 --> 01:03:00,852
(Holding him in check)

1812
01:03:01,622 --> 01:03:02,951
We get five seconds.

1813
01:03:02,952 --> 01:03:04,651
- Okay. Five, four, - Five four,

1814
01:03:04,652 --> 01:03:06,452
- three, two...
- It's over once you grab it.

1815
01:03:06,692 --> 01:03:08,362
I'll grab here.

1816
01:03:08,892 --> 01:03:10,561
- I'll go.
- Don't grab...

1817
01:03:10,562 --> 01:03:11,792
- too little.
- Okay.

1818
01:03:12,192 --> 01:03:13,561
At least a knuckle's length.

1819
01:03:13,562 --> 01:03:14,602
Yes.

1820
01:03:15,002 --> 01:03:16,032
I'll grab this.

1821
01:03:16,932 --> 01:03:18,572
Isn't your side too withered?

1822
01:03:19,102 --> 01:03:20,972
- It's not.
- Isn't it?

1823
01:03:21,032 --> 01:03:22,071
It's too withered.

1824
01:03:22,072 --> 01:03:23,471
- I mean...
- Oh, it's coming off.

1825
01:03:23,472 --> 01:03:25,041
- It's ripping!
- Hey!

1826
01:03:25,042 --> 01:03:26,371
- Let's start.
- Okay.

1827
01:03:26,372 --> 01:03:28,112
- No.
- Let's play fair.

1828
01:03:28,342 --> 01:03:30,382
- In 1, 2, 3.
- In 1, 2, 3.

1829
01:03:32,152 --> 01:03:33,852
What?

1830
01:03:34,112 --> 01:03:35,181
(Yeon Seok loses by a landslide.)

1831
01:03:35,182 --> 01:03:36,651
I thought you were number one.

1832
01:03:36,652 --> 01:03:38,221
(Yeon Seok loses by a landslide.)

1833
01:03:38,222 --> 01:03:40,462
- Isn't this too much?
- You should have ripped it fast.

1834
01:03:40,592 --> 01:03:42,098
- How does it feel?
- This is too big.

1835
01:03:42,122 --> 01:03:43,222
It's over.

1836
01:03:44,022 --> 01:03:45,691
(Eating out of anger)

1837
01:03:45,692 --> 01:03:49,002
Oh, I ate delicious food and didn't pay again.

1838
01:03:51,232 --> 01:03:52,272
I love it.

1839
01:03:53,402 --> 01:03:54,641
(The hot pot boils like Yeon Seok's inside.)

1840
01:03:54,642 --> 01:03:56,302
It's a perfect finish with the hot pot.

1841
01:03:56,442 --> 01:03:58,711
When are we supposed to eat it?

1842
01:03:58,712 --> 01:03:59,841
- Should we boil it more?
- It depends...

1843
01:03:59,842 --> 01:04:02,041
on the color of the cabbage.

1844
01:04:02,042 --> 01:04:03,111
(Impressed)

1845
01:04:03,112 --> 01:04:05,411
- The color of the cabbage!
- When the cabbage turns clear,

1846
01:04:05,412 --> 01:04:07,711
it means the vegetables are cooked.

1847
01:04:07,712 --> 01:04:09,681
But this also contains radish,

1848
01:04:09,682 --> 01:04:10,921
- so...
- So, you check the radish.

1849
01:04:10,922 --> 01:04:13,721
It gets more and more refreshing as the radish cooks.

1850
01:04:13,722 --> 01:04:15,821
If you like your food bland,

1851
01:04:15,822 --> 01:04:17,722
- you can start eating now.
- Okay.

1852
01:04:17,992 --> 01:04:20,062
- But if you...
- Are we good to go, then?

1853
01:04:20,862 --> 01:04:22,662
- You're mocking me, aren't you?
- No.

1854
01:04:22,862 --> 01:04:24,472
I just felt it.

1855
01:04:25,302 --> 01:04:27,602
- I was talking so seriously.
- I wasn't.

1856
01:04:28,142 --> 01:04:30,041
- I think we can eat it now.
- Yes.

1857
01:04:30,042 --> 01:04:31,612
(The tripe hot pot is all cooked now.)

1858
01:04:32,742 --> 01:04:34,312
- What's it like?
- This is also tasty.

1859
01:04:34,482 --> 01:04:35,512
It's so good.

1860
01:04:36,642 --> 01:04:38,111
This is delicious.

1861
01:04:38,112 --> 01:04:39,212
(Ready to eat again)

1862
01:04:43,122 --> 01:04:44,381
It's good. What do you need?

1863
01:04:44,382 --> 01:04:45,922
Can I eat this bowl of rice?

1864
01:04:46,292 --> 01:04:47,322
- Of course.
- Thank you.

1865
01:04:49,162 --> 01:04:50,921
(Also eating a bowl of rice)

1866
01:04:50,922 --> 01:04:52,392
Imagine if we hadn't come here.

1867
01:04:53,762 --> 01:04:54,802
Thank you for taking us.

1868
01:04:55,662 --> 01:04:56,662
It's good.

1869
01:04:56,662 --> 01:04:57,662
(Frowning because it's too good)

1870
01:04:57,663 --> 01:05:01,171
You didn't seem so happy when we entered,

1871
01:05:01,172 --> 01:05:02,941
but you seem to be enjoying it now that we're eating it.

1872
01:05:02,942 --> 01:05:04,171
Yes, that's what I usually do.

1873
01:05:04,172 --> 01:05:05,311
- You're enjoying the most among us.
- I...

1874
01:05:05,312 --> 01:05:06,642
Absolutely.

1875
01:05:07,412 --> 01:05:09,112
And Yeon Seok is paying.

1876
01:05:09,282 --> 01:05:11,452
- I know. Thank you.
- Thank you for the food.

1877
01:05:11,812 --> 01:05:13,751
It was such a good meal.

1878
01:05:13,752 --> 01:05:15,481
- We enjoyed it so much.
- Thank you for the food.

1879
01:05:15,482 --> 01:05:16,552
We'll come again, sir.

1880
01:05:16,682 --> 01:05:18,392
- It was so tasty. Thank you.
- Thank you.

1881
01:05:18,692 --> 01:05:20,551
- We really enjoyed the food.
- Seriously.

1882
01:05:20,552 --> 01:05:22,262
Thank you, Yeon Seok.

1883
01:05:22,422 --> 01:05:23,921
Yeon Shik, thank you for the food.

1884
01:05:23,922 --> 01:05:26,261
They should try out the place.

1885
01:05:26,262 --> 01:05:27,792
- I know.
- Seriously.

1886
01:05:28,332 --> 01:05:30,031
- Should we tell them?
- Excuse me.

1887
01:05:30,032 --> 01:05:31,032
(Opening)

1888
01:05:31,033 --> 01:05:33,572
- What?
- Ma'am, that restaurant is so good.

1889
01:05:34,302 --> 01:05:36,042
- You should try the pork belly...
- Okay.

1890
01:05:36,272 --> 01:05:37,941
- and hot pot.
- We'll do that.

1891
01:05:37,942 --> 01:05:39,212
Please do that.

1892
01:05:39,612 --> 01:05:41,011
Please do that.

1893
01:05:41,012 --> 01:05:42,081
Come on.

1894
01:05:42,082 --> 01:05:44,241
(He promotes the restaurant with his entire body.)

1895
01:05:44,242 --> 01:05:45,351
It was so tasty.

1896
01:05:45,352 --> 01:05:46,782
- It was so tasty, right?
- Yes.

1897
01:05:47,652 --> 01:05:49,521
- Yeon Shik.
- Yes?

1898
01:05:49,522 --> 01:05:52,052
I'm happy after eating some good food today.

1899
01:05:52,692 --> 01:05:54,921
Take Young Woo and Si Ah and keep going.

1900
01:05:54,922 --> 01:05:56,562
- I'll go home.
- What?

1901
01:05:57,722 --> 01:06:00,231
It's Christmas. Please buy us a cake and coffee.

1902
01:06:00,232 --> 01:06:02,331
- That's right. I'll do that.
- Okay.

1903
01:06:02,332 --> 01:06:05,571
(They enter the third cafe of the day.)

1904
01:06:05,572 --> 01:06:07,901
- One light hot Americano, please.
- Okay.

1905
01:06:07,902 --> 01:06:10,102
- One hot honey green tea, please.
- Okay.

1906
01:06:10,472 --> 01:06:11,742
- Honey green tea?
- Yes.

1907
01:06:12,542 --> 01:06:14,171
I'll have hot honey green tea instead.

1908
01:06:14,172 --> 01:06:15,641
(2 hot honey green tea, 1 iced Americano)

1909
01:06:15,642 --> 01:06:17,712
- Why are you copying me?
- I'm not copying you.

1910
01:06:17,882 --> 01:06:19,658
- I want honey green tea too.
- It sounds good, right?

1911
01:06:19,682 --> 01:06:21,321
- It sounds delicious, right?
- It sounds very delicious.

1912
01:06:21,322 --> 01:06:22,442
- I know.
- Honey green tea.

1913
01:06:22,682 --> 01:06:25,321
- Honey green tea.
- Please don't make it too sweet.

1914
01:06:25,322 --> 01:06:26,721
(It's because of this.)

1915
01:06:26,722 --> 01:06:29,292
Is this a cake or a pile of strawberries?

1916
01:06:29,822 --> 01:06:30,962
This is incredible.

1917
01:06:31,962 --> 01:06:33,692
- Let's cut it.
- Young Woo...

1918
01:06:34,292 --> 01:06:35,802
has used a scalpel before.

1919
01:06:35,962 --> 01:06:37,332
They use insane cakes these days.

1920
01:06:37,702 --> 01:06:39,302
- Seriously.
- Strawberries are falling.

1921
01:06:39,472 --> 01:06:40,501
On a plate.

1922
01:06:40,502 --> 01:06:41,542
(Exclaiming)

1923
01:06:42,072 --> 01:06:43,341
- Gosh.
- Thank you.

1924
01:06:43,342 --> 01:06:44,771
(Strawberries on the outside, cake on the inside)

1925
01:06:44,772 --> 01:06:45,972
There are so many.

1926
01:06:46,572 --> 01:06:47,732
It's covered in strawberries.

1927
01:06:47,842 --> 01:06:49,911
It's a strawberry bomb.

1928
01:06:49,912 --> 01:06:51,582
That's why it's named Berry Bomb.

1929
01:06:51,952 --> 01:06:53,582
There's cream inside.

1930
01:06:53,812 --> 01:06:55,822
- It's like eating strawberries.
- It's so tasty.

1931
01:06:56,482 --> 01:06:57,522
- Right?
- Yes.

1932
01:06:58,322 --> 01:07:00,022
I haven't finished a cake in a while.

1933
01:07:00,522 --> 01:07:03,292
In most cakes, you save the strawberries.

1934
01:07:03,822 --> 01:07:05,562
But this one has so many strawberries.

1935
01:07:05,892 --> 01:07:08,332
- There's no need to save them.
- There's no need. I love it.

1936
01:07:08,362 --> 01:07:10,762
What? You're good at product placement.

1937
01:07:11,372 --> 01:07:12,632
- Really?
- My goodness.

1938
01:07:12,732 --> 01:07:14,641
- She eats it well too.
- Si Ah.

1939
01:07:14,642 --> 01:07:15,872
- Was it okay?
- Yes.

1940
01:07:16,472 --> 01:07:19,012
I see vanilla beans.

1941
01:07:19,142 --> 01:07:21,141
- It's like custard cream.
- Yes, it's like custard cream.

1942
01:07:21,142 --> 01:07:23,181
Is it Earl Grey? There's something in the cream.

1943
01:07:23,182 --> 01:07:24,312
(Impressed)

1944
01:07:25,012 --> 01:07:26,972
- How professional.
- You're pretty professional.

1945
01:07:27,112 --> 01:07:28,182
Have you studied?

1946
01:07:28,652 --> 01:07:30,821
- She's a foodie.
- Before filming "Country Cook,"

1947
01:07:30,822 --> 01:07:32,292
I studied a lot.

1948
01:07:32,752 --> 01:07:34,321
I love to eat,

1949
01:07:34,322 --> 01:07:35,802
so I picked up information naturally.

1950
01:07:36,092 --> 01:07:38,632
Si Ah can do that because she loves to eat.

1951
01:07:39,192 --> 01:07:40,332
He finished it.

1952
01:07:40,492 --> 01:07:41,602
I finished it too.

1953
01:07:42,232 --> 01:07:43,261
I totally devoured it.

1954
01:07:43,262 --> 01:07:44,731
I have no regrets today.

1955
01:07:44,732 --> 01:07:45,801
I'm so full.

1956
01:07:45,802 --> 01:07:49,002
Let's meet the second applicant and succeed in the mission.

1957
01:07:49,342 --> 01:07:51,341
- I'm so full.
- Hello.

1958
01:07:51,342 --> 01:07:52,342
Hello.

1959
01:07:52,572 --> 01:07:54,242
This is fun. It's like a travel vlog.

1960
01:07:54,612 --> 01:07:56,012
Hello.

1961
01:07:56,312 --> 01:07:57,882
Where are we going right now?

1962
01:07:58,552 --> 01:08:02,082
We're on our way to meet the second applicant.

1963
01:08:03,182 --> 01:08:04,282
Ms. Jo Mi Ah.

1964
01:08:04,792 --> 01:08:07,152
"This is a place where we pan-fry, stir-fry, and deep-fry!"

1965
01:08:07,322 --> 01:08:09,561
"We used to taste each other's day..."

1966
01:08:09,562 --> 01:08:12,432
"and season it with conversations."

1967
01:08:12,932 --> 01:08:14,702
"But we welcomed a long break."

1968
01:08:15,232 --> 01:08:17,201
"Before next March,"

1969
01:08:17,202 --> 01:08:20,472
"please give us a spoonful of good memories."

1970
01:08:20,832 --> 01:08:21,971
- Next March?
- March?

1971
01:08:21,972 --> 01:08:23,501
The beginning of a new semester?

1972
01:08:23,502 --> 01:08:24,771
It must be a snack bar in front of a school.

1973
01:08:24,772 --> 01:08:26,312
(A snack bar in front of a school?)

1974
01:08:26,942 --> 01:08:29,281
- I think it's a restaurant.
- It's a restaurant.

1975
01:08:29,282 --> 01:08:31,042
But the address tells me that it's a school.

1976
01:08:31,112 --> 01:08:33,452
- What? School cafeteria?
- School cafeteria?

1977
01:08:34,612 --> 01:08:36,481
(Meanwhile, in front of spare time location)

1978
01:08:36,482 --> 01:08:38,952
- Is it them?
- Aren't they here to see us?

1979
01:08:39,492 --> 01:08:40,852
- "Start."
- Where are they going?

1980
01:08:41,422 --> 01:08:43,461
- I think it's them.
- They're going too far.

1981
01:08:43,462 --> 01:08:44,992
Oh, my. I think we should run.

1982
01:08:46,592 --> 01:08:48,262
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

1983
01:08:48,832 --> 01:08:50,401
- I'll get out this way.
- Okay.

1984
01:08:50,402 --> 01:08:52,331
- All right.
- All right.

1985
01:08:52,332 --> 01:08:53,402
My goodness.

1986
01:08:53,972 --> 01:08:55,402
- Hello.
- Hello.

1987
01:08:55,942 --> 01:08:57,342
- Hello.
- Nice to meet you.

1988
01:08:57,472 --> 01:08:58,611
- Hello.
- Did you wait here?

1989
01:08:58,612 --> 01:08:59,771
- Hello.
- We met here.

1990
01:08:59,772 --> 01:09:01,112
- Ms. Mi Ah?
- That's me.

1991
01:09:01,372 --> 01:09:03,082
- Come on up.
- Hello.

1992
01:09:03,382 --> 01:09:06,512
(Jo Mi Ah, second Whenever Guest)

1993
01:09:07,012 --> 01:09:08,652
- Come on up.
- Hello.

1994
01:09:08,752 --> 01:09:10,621
Is this an elementary school?

1995
01:09:10,622 --> 01:09:12,022
- Yes, it is.
- Yes.

1996
01:09:12,292 --> 01:09:14,891
You talked about pan-frying, stir-frying, and deep-frying.

1997
01:09:14,892 --> 01:09:16,821
- Is this a school cafeteria?
- Yes.

1998
01:09:16,822 --> 01:09:18,332
My goodness. We were right.

1999
01:09:18,562 --> 01:09:19,661
That's right.

2000
01:09:19,662 --> 01:09:21,902
- Shall we go inside?
- Okay.

2001
01:09:22,602 --> 01:09:25,872
(At a school, children run freely and learn.)

2002
01:09:26,832 --> 01:09:29,672
(This is where children fill their stomachs for the day.)

2003
01:09:30,102 --> 01:09:32,342
(The ones who are in charge of making a filling meal, )

2004
01:09:32,842 --> 01:09:35,342
(school cooks are the second Whenever Guests.)

2005
01:09:38,082 --> 01:09:41,351
- Are children still in school?
- Yes, they are.

2006
01:09:41,352 --> 01:09:43,752
They had lunch and began the fifth period.

2007
01:09:43,922 --> 01:09:45,591
- Did the fifth period start?
- Are there children in the school?

2008
01:09:45,592 --> 01:09:46,728
There are children in the school.

2009
01:09:46,752 --> 01:09:48,192
I bet they'll be cute.

2010
01:09:48,522 --> 01:09:49,591
- It's this way.
- Hello.

2011
01:09:49,592 --> 01:09:52,061
- Is this the school cafeteria?
- It's the school cafeteria.

2012
01:09:52,062 --> 01:09:54,622
- It's the school cafeteria.
- Had we known, we wouldn't have...

2013
01:09:54,832 --> 01:09:57,062
- I know.
- We should've eaten here.

2014
01:09:57,462 --> 01:09:58,931
- Excuse me.
- We should've eaten here.

2015
01:09:58,932 --> 01:10:00,301
- Nice to meet you.
- Please come on in.

2016
01:10:00,302 --> 01:10:01,872
- May we enter as we are?
- Yes.

2017
01:10:02,072 --> 01:10:03,572
- This is a resting area.
- Yes.

2018
01:10:04,142 --> 01:10:05,711
- Hello.
- Hello.

2019
01:10:05,712 --> 01:10:07,212
- Hello.
- Hello.

2020
01:10:07,242 --> 01:10:08,441
- Hello.
- Come on in.

2021
01:10:08,442 --> 01:10:10,682
- Hello.
- Hello.

2022
01:10:10,782 --> 01:10:12,552
- This is a resting area.
- Yes.

2023
01:10:12,952 --> 01:10:14,922
- Hello.
- Nice to meet you.

2024
01:10:15,522 --> 01:10:16,781
Please take a seat.

2025
01:10:16,782 --> 01:10:17,862
(They sit down for a talk.)

2026
01:10:18,222 --> 01:10:20,021
- This is...
- It has been a while.

2027
01:10:20,022 --> 01:10:21,822
- This must be a meal plan.
- That's right.

2028
01:10:22,292 --> 01:10:24,162
- May we take a look?
- Of course.

2029
01:10:24,832 --> 01:10:28,501
(December to February meal plan)

2030
01:10:28,502 --> 01:10:31,362
(Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday...)

2031
01:10:31,732 --> 01:10:34,871
You make all the tasty dishes.

2032
01:10:34,872 --> 01:10:35,902
Yes.

2033
01:10:36,242 --> 01:10:39,572
(They suit children's taste.)

2034
01:10:39,812 --> 01:10:41,641
Every day, they get the dishes...

2035
01:10:41,642 --> 01:10:43,042
- I know.
- we got once in a month.

2036
01:10:43,082 --> 01:10:46,751
- The nutritional values...
- That's right.

2037
01:10:46,752 --> 01:10:48,182
- have to be calculated too.
- Yes.

2038
01:10:49,782 --> 01:10:53,522
Mi Ah, how did you apply to be on the show?

2039
01:10:53,692 --> 01:10:57,091
When I first came here, my friend...

2040
01:10:57,092 --> 01:10:59,832
treated me well and taught me things with patience.

2041
01:11:00,062 --> 01:11:01,602
Everyone else did that too.

2042
01:11:02,532 --> 01:11:05,501
(The four of them became close like actual sisters.)

2043
01:11:05,502 --> 01:11:07,032
But Ji Hyun...

2044
01:11:07,132 --> 01:11:08,852
- She's going to a different school.
- Yes.

2045
01:11:09,372 --> 01:11:11,442
I was so disappointed...

2046
01:11:11,672 --> 01:11:14,572
that I wanted to have a good memory with her.

2047
01:11:15,342 --> 01:11:16,682
It's so disappointing.

2048
01:11:16,942 --> 01:11:18,411
- You must be sad.
- How disappointing.

2049
01:11:18,412 --> 01:11:19,652
Can't you work here for longer?

2050
01:11:20,112 --> 01:11:21,622
I want to work here for longer.

2051
01:11:22,052 --> 01:11:25,851
Every five years, we move to a different school.

2052
01:11:25,852 --> 01:11:27,012
- You have to do that.
- Yes.

2053
01:11:27,192 --> 01:11:30,821
The four of you became close by working hard together...

2054
01:11:30,822 --> 01:11:33,732
- for many years.
- That's right.

2055
01:11:34,062 --> 01:11:35,062
I see.

2056
01:11:35,063 --> 01:11:37,762
- The floor is hot.
- This place is very cozy.

2057
01:11:38,332 --> 01:11:39,671
We need to relax on a heated floor because...

2058
01:11:39,672 --> 01:11:42,141
- our work is physically taxing.
- I bet it's necessary.

2059
01:11:42,142 --> 01:11:44,071
- Seriously.
- You need to stay warm.

2060
01:11:44,072 --> 01:11:45,412
They'll be able to nap here.

2061
01:11:45,742 --> 01:11:47,112
(That's right.)

2062
01:11:47,212 --> 01:11:49,642
- What was the menu of the day?
- Pork belly.

2063
01:11:51,782 --> 01:11:54,112
- We had pork belly too.
- We had pork belly too.

2064
01:11:54,382 --> 01:11:55,822
Did you have pork belly too?

2065
01:11:56,252 --> 01:11:57,352
I see.

2066
01:11:57,722 --> 01:12:01,052
How do you cook pork belly at a school cafeteria?

2067
01:12:01,422 --> 01:12:03,492
Do you grill each strip?

2068
01:12:03,722 --> 01:12:07,531
We season the meat and cook it in the oven.

2069
01:12:07,532 --> 01:12:09,602
- Then you cut the meat.
- That's right.

2070
01:12:09,832 --> 01:12:12,032
- Children love it, right?
- That's right.

2071
01:12:12,432 --> 01:12:14,502
What other dishes do children love?

2072
01:12:14,832 --> 01:12:16,341
Tanghulu. We make it tomorrow.

2073
01:12:16,342 --> 01:12:18,062
- Tanghulu?
- Do they get tanghulu as well?

2074
01:12:18,842 --> 01:12:20,482
Do children get tanghulu in school lunch?

2075
01:12:20,572 --> 01:12:23,282
- They get tanghulu in school lunch.
- I know.

2076
01:12:23,712 --> 01:12:25,611
How many students are there?

2077
01:12:25,612 --> 01:12:26,982
About 300.

2078
01:12:27,912 --> 01:12:30,721
- You have to skewer the fruits.
- Yes.

2079
01:12:30,722 --> 01:12:31,951
- That's right.
- We do it together.

2080
01:12:31,952 --> 01:12:33,721
Tanghulu for 300 students.

2081
01:12:33,722 --> 01:12:35,461
Tomorrow morning, we need to start earlier...

2082
01:12:35,462 --> 01:12:37,422
- than usual.
- We need to do that.

2083
01:12:37,562 --> 01:12:38,732
That's incredible.

2084
01:12:39,792 --> 01:12:41,631
At what hour do you come to work?

2085
01:12:41,632 --> 01:12:43,061
- At 7am.
- We need to be here by 7am.

2086
01:12:43,062 --> 01:12:45,342
But we usually get here by 6:30am. and make preparations.

2087
01:12:45,472 --> 01:12:47,401
You need to do that to prepare lunch.

2088
01:12:47,402 --> 01:12:49,642
The school will go on a winter break until March.

2089
01:12:49,872 --> 01:12:52,271
- Will you have some time to rest?
- Yes.

2090
01:12:52,272 --> 01:12:53,918
We'll need to go to the hospital diligently.

2091
01:12:53,942 --> 01:12:55,041
Hospital cafeteria?

2092
01:12:55,042 --> 01:12:56,781
(Hospital cafeteria?)

2093
01:12:56,782 --> 01:12:58,182
- No.
- Hospital.

2094
01:12:58,312 --> 01:13:00,752
- We need to get treated.
- The work is physically demanding,

2095
01:13:01,012 --> 01:13:03,572
so our bodies are in bad shape. We need to go to the hospital...

2096
01:13:03,722 --> 01:13:04,781
for the next semester.

2097
01:13:04,782 --> 01:13:07,721
To cook 300 servings of food,

2098
01:13:07,722 --> 01:13:09,561
- you'll need special cooking tools.
- That's right.

2099
01:13:09,562 --> 01:13:11,192
- We stir-fry using a shovel.
- Right.

2100
01:13:11,492 --> 01:13:12,991
School lunches are something else.

2101
01:13:12,992 --> 01:13:15,101
Si Ah, what did you like?

2102
01:13:15,102 --> 01:13:17,002
I liked stir-fried sundae.

2103
01:13:17,132 --> 01:13:19,332
- Stir-fried sundae.
- You liked that.

2104
01:13:19,902 --> 01:13:21,002
How about you, Young Woo?

2105
01:13:21,202 --> 01:13:23,342
I liked fish cutlets.

2106
01:13:24,602 --> 01:13:25,672
Spicy stir-fried pork.

2107
01:13:25,742 --> 01:13:26,942
- Right.
- Fernbrake.

2108
01:13:27,242 --> 01:13:30,212
- What? Do you like fernbrake?
- That's unusual.

2109
01:13:30,582 --> 01:13:33,982
Back in my time, moms packed lunch for their children.

2110
01:13:35,882 --> 01:13:37,822
I also ate packed lunch.

2111
01:13:38,792 --> 01:13:39,951
That shows your age.

2112
01:13:39,952 --> 01:13:41,112
(That shows Yeon Seok's age.)

2113
01:13:41,492 --> 01:13:43,592
- We didn't have school cafeterias.
- That's right.

2114
01:13:43,822 --> 01:13:45,982
We couldn't even complain since our moms packed lunch.

2115
01:13:46,232 --> 01:13:47,592
(I see.)

2116
01:13:47,792 --> 01:13:48,802
Yes.

2117
01:13:49,332 --> 01:13:51,932
- What is it?
- It feels like a dream.

2118
01:13:53,072 --> 01:13:54,731
I thought you were pitying me...

2119
01:13:54,732 --> 01:13:56,771
- for not having a school cafeteria.
- No.

2120
01:13:56,772 --> 01:13:58,772
- I'm just happy.
- I thought you were pitying me.

2121
01:13:59,942 --> 01:14:01,671
There's a coupon.

2122
01:14:01,672 --> 01:14:04,511
- Young Woo, roll the dice.
- Okay, I'll do it.

2123
01:14:04,512 --> 01:14:07,681
- You receive free chances...
- Free chances.

2124
01:14:07,682 --> 01:14:09,421
- in the number...
- Let's go.

2125
01:14:09,422 --> 01:14:10,622
You get.

2126
01:14:10,882 --> 01:14:12,852
Here I go. I'll roll it.

2127
01:14:13,522 --> 01:14:14,752
Drum roll.

2128
01:14:14,922 --> 01:14:15,961
Here I go.

2129
01:14:15,962 --> 01:14:17,321
- Two.
- Two.

2130
01:14:17,322 --> 01:14:18,661
- Two.
- Two.

2131
01:14:18,662 --> 01:14:20,291
(Please)

2132
01:14:20,292 --> 01:14:21,561
Drum roll.

2133
01:14:21,562 --> 01:14:22,632
Here I go.

2134
01:14:22,802 --> 01:14:25,472
- What?
- It didn't roll. No.

2135
01:14:25,802 --> 01:14:27,871
(What?)

2136
01:14:27,872 --> 01:14:29,541
- No.
- Wasn't it a practice round?

2137
01:14:29,542 --> 01:14:30,942
- It didn't roll.
- Zero.

2138
01:14:31,142 --> 01:14:33,242
Young Woo, you haven't been doing well today.

2139
01:14:33,342 --> 01:14:34,772
I guess today is my unlucky day.

2140
01:14:35,512 --> 01:14:37,142
- Today is my unlucky day.
- Zero Woo.

2141
01:14:38,242 --> 01:14:40,252
Round 1. Round 1 prize.

2142
01:14:40,912 --> 01:14:42,652
- Let's do well.
- Here you go.

2143
01:14:42,852 --> 01:14:45,192
Please check the Round One prize.

2144
01:14:45,752 --> 01:14:47,522
- I'm nervous.
- My goodness.

2145
01:14:48,192 --> 01:14:49,862
- What is it?
- Look inside.

2146
01:14:50,192 --> 01:14:53,992
"Since you rinse, chop, and stir-fry large quantities of food,"

2147
01:14:54,462 --> 01:14:56,762
"you need to massage your muscles whenever possible."

2148
01:14:57,102 --> 01:15:00,102
A full-care massager set.

2149
01:15:01,942 --> 01:15:03,172
I want to give it to them.

2150
01:15:04,772 --> 01:15:06,871
- It's a good prize.
- We must win it.

2151
01:15:06,872 --> 01:15:08,042
There's one of each kind.

2152
01:15:08,372 --> 01:15:10,482
- I really want to give it to them.
- Let's win it.

2153
01:15:10,882 --> 01:15:12,211
You really need it.

2154
01:15:12,212 --> 01:15:13,612
- That's right.
- We need it a lot.

2155
01:15:13,752 --> 01:15:15,951
The kind of mission we get is important.

2156
01:15:15,952 --> 01:15:17,081
- Please give us something easy.
- Seriously.

2157
01:15:17,082 --> 01:15:18,691
- It's nerve-racking.
- The mission is...

2158
01:15:18,692 --> 01:15:20,921
(Masterful touch of the chopsticks)

2159
01:15:20,922 --> 01:15:22,921
(Using chopsticks, )

2160
01:15:22,922 --> 01:15:25,292
(stack 6 dice on a soup bowl.)

2161
01:15:25,392 --> 01:15:28,161
(The last player must ring a bell to succeed in the mission.)

2162
01:15:28,162 --> 01:15:31,402
(But the time limit is 30 seconds.)

2163
01:15:32,432 --> 01:15:35,031
- Chopsticks.
- We move them using chopsticks.

2164
01:15:35,032 --> 01:15:36,041
(Stack dice using chopsticks?)

2165
01:15:36,042 --> 01:15:38,772
So the 4 of us each stack 1 die.

2166
01:15:39,642 --> 01:15:41,372
Then the 2 of them stack 1 more die.

2167
01:15:42,012 --> 01:15:43,842
- I...
- On this soup bowl...

2168
01:15:44,542 --> 01:15:45,851
Four? Six?

2169
01:15:45,852 --> 01:15:48,111
(It isn't easy to pick up the die.)

2170
01:15:48,112 --> 01:15:49,282
One at a time.

2171
01:15:49,552 --> 01:15:50,882
(Stack 6 dice like this.)

2172
01:15:50,982 --> 01:15:51,992
Like this.

2173
01:15:53,392 --> 01:15:54,791
- This is...
- It's so hard.

2174
01:15:54,792 --> 01:15:56,992
- It isn't easy.
- Using chopsticks... Is there...

2175
01:15:57,162 --> 01:15:58,882
- Is there a time limit?
- It's 30 seconds.

2176
01:15:59,232 --> 01:16:00,691
There's a time limit.

2177
01:16:00,692 --> 01:16:01,832
One person at a time.

2178
01:16:05,172 --> 01:16:07,812
- You're good at using chopsticks.
- I'm good at using chopsticks.

2179
01:16:08,102 --> 01:16:09,378
You're good at using chopsticks.

2180
01:16:09,402 --> 01:16:10,672
I think it'll work.

2181
01:16:12,672 --> 01:16:14,042
You need to hold the ends.

2182
01:16:15,142 --> 01:16:17,012
(He already has know-how.)

2183
01:16:17,712 --> 01:16:19,211
You're good at using chopsticks.

2184
01:16:19,212 --> 01:16:20,251
(Glancing over)

2185
01:16:20,252 --> 01:16:21,351
This is hard.

2186
01:16:21,352 --> 01:16:23,082
(Si Ah looks nervous.)

2187
01:16:23,782 --> 01:16:25,721
(For a while, )

2188
01:16:25,722 --> 01:16:26,821
(she has held them in an X-shape.)

2189
01:16:26,822 --> 01:16:27,892
(Wary)

2190
01:16:28,622 --> 01:16:30,421
(She has tried sticking the die between the chopsticks.)

2191
01:16:30,422 --> 01:16:31,462
(Wary)

2192
01:16:31,562 --> 01:16:33,392
(She has tried lifting the die.)

2193
01:16:33,992 --> 01:16:35,501
- Then two people...
- Right.

2194
01:16:35,502 --> 01:16:38,061
(She has been struggling alone with the chopsticks.)

2195
01:16:38,062 --> 01:16:40,001
People on this side will go twice.

2196
01:16:40,002 --> 01:16:41,272
I'm in trouble.

2197
01:16:41,332 --> 01:16:42,441
Si Ah, your chopstick skills...

2198
01:16:42,442 --> 01:16:44,362
- I'm bad at using chopsticks.
- You'll go last.

2199
01:16:44,842 --> 01:16:46,371
Shall we practice in this order?

2200
01:16:46,372 --> 01:16:48,682
- Okay, let's do that.
- We'll stack two dice each.

2201
01:16:49,182 --> 01:16:50,911
- One, two.
- The first ones should go fast.

2202
01:16:50,912 --> 01:16:52,472
(Yeon Seok and Young Woo go very fast.)

2203
01:16:53,612 --> 01:16:55,222
- Oh, no.
- If it falls over, you fail.

2204
01:16:55,682 --> 01:16:56,682
Do we start over then?

2205
01:16:56,683 --> 01:16:58,728
- It's hard to cross them.
- Si Ah, hold them close like this.

2206
01:16:58,752 --> 01:16:59,951
- Hold them close?
- Yes.

2207
01:16:59,952 --> 01:17:01,421
- Like this?
- There you go.

2208
01:17:01,422 --> 01:17:02,782
- There you go.
- Keep them short.

2209
01:17:03,962 --> 01:17:05,691
- Shall I do this?
- Yes, do that.

2210
01:17:05,692 --> 01:17:07,661
- Just like that...
- It's working. I did it.

2211
01:17:07,662 --> 01:17:08,982
- There you go.
- Thank goodness.

2212
01:17:09,362 --> 01:17:10,502
I did it.

2213
01:17:10,862 --> 01:17:11,931
- Well done.
- Keep them short.

2214
01:17:11,932 --> 01:17:13,871
- Okay.
- We're set.

2215
01:17:13,872 --> 01:17:14,901
(There's hope!)

2216
01:17:14,902 --> 01:17:16,471
This is doable.

2217
01:17:16,472 --> 01:17:18,441
Here comes the first try.

2218
01:17:18,442 --> 01:17:19,922
We don't have any free chances today.

2219
01:17:20,812 --> 01:17:24,312
(The first try for the massagers)

2220
01:17:24,542 --> 01:17:27,481
Let's begin the 1st try. In 1, 2, 3.

2221
01:17:27,482 --> 01:17:28,551
- Here we go!
- Here we go!

2222
01:17:28,552 --> 01:17:29,552
(Out of 10 total tries, they're on try number 1.)

2223
01:17:29,553 --> 01:17:30,582
Ready.

2224
01:17:30,722 --> 01:17:31,782
Set.

2225
01:17:39,462 --> 01:17:40,492
Come on.

2226
01:17:40,692 --> 01:17:42,132
(They succeed in the 3rd level.)

2227
01:17:42,932 --> 01:17:46,172
(The one who was struggling, Si Ah stacks it well.)

2228
01:17:52,942 --> 01:17:55,411
- Fifteen seconds.
- We have enough time.

2229
01:17:55,412 --> 01:17:56,712
- Relax.
- We have enough time.

2230
01:17:58,412 --> 01:17:59,752
Ten seconds.

2231
01:17:59,912 --> 01:18:02,181
(He stacks the 5th level.)

2232
01:18:02,182 --> 01:18:03,981
- It's okay. Relax.
- All right.

2233
01:18:03,982 --> 01:18:06,021
- You can keep them short.
- Five, four...

2234
01:18:06,022 --> 01:18:07,291
(One die remains!)

2235
01:18:07,292 --> 01:18:08,351
Four...

2236
01:18:08,352 --> 01:18:10,661
- You can keep them short.
- Five, four,

2237
01:18:10,662 --> 01:18:12,962
- three, two, one.
- The bell.

2238
01:18:13,762 --> 01:18:14,832
What?

2239
01:18:16,232 --> 01:18:17,232
Jae Suk.

2240
01:18:17,232 --> 01:18:18,232
We did it.

2241
01:18:18,832 --> 01:18:20,332
- Two, one.
- The bell.

2242
01:18:20,932 --> 01:18:23,302
(They succeed in Round 1.)

2243
01:18:23,542 --> 01:18:24,571
Hey.

2244
01:18:24,572 --> 01:18:26,242
We did it.

2245
01:18:26,872 --> 01:18:28,541
Okay.

2246
01:18:28,542 --> 01:18:29,641
(Choo Weak Link wrapped up the first success of the day.)

2247
01:18:29,642 --> 01:18:30,781
We did it.

2248
01:18:30,782 --> 01:18:31,841
- What?
- My goodness.

2249
01:18:31,842 --> 01:18:33,352
(He can't believe it.)

2250
01:18:33,482 --> 01:18:36,182
- My goodness.
- Young Woo is good at something!

2251
01:18:38,792 --> 01:18:40,851
- We did it.
- Seriously.

2252
01:18:40,852 --> 01:18:42,861
- My goodness.
- The record is 29.40 seconds.

2253
01:18:42,862 --> 01:18:45,661
(They had a thrilling success in 29.40 seconds.)

2254
01:18:45,662 --> 01:18:48,492
- We did it.
- We almost failed.

2255
01:18:48,902 --> 01:18:50,262
I have a good feeling about today.

2256
01:18:50,762 --> 01:18:52,132
Round Two.

2257
01:18:52,832 --> 01:18:54,931
Please decide whether you'll keep going...

2258
01:18:54,932 --> 01:18:56,101
or stop.

2259
01:18:56,102 --> 01:18:57,841
- In 1, 2, 3.
- Go!

2260
01:18:57,842 --> 01:19:00,342
- Of course.
- You have to keep going.

2261
01:19:01,172 --> 01:19:02,611
- Open it.
- I'm curious.

2262
01:19:02,612 --> 01:19:04,442
(What's the Round 2 prize?)

2263
01:19:05,142 --> 01:19:08,511
"You walk up the hill in the dark to go to work in the morning."

2264
01:19:08,512 --> 01:19:11,181
"It'll be nice to start the winter days with warmth."

2265
01:19:11,182 --> 01:19:14,821
Four pairs of N padded boots.

2266
01:19:14,822 --> 01:19:16,162
(4 pairs of N padded boots)

2267
01:19:16,262 --> 01:19:17,562
We really need them.

2268
01:19:17,792 --> 01:19:18,992
Let's go.

2269
01:19:19,362 --> 01:19:20,362
My goodness.

2270
01:19:20,363 --> 01:19:22,661
- N brand.
- Those boots are warm.

2271
01:19:22,662 --> 01:19:24,261
- Four pairs?
- Really?

2272
01:19:24,262 --> 01:19:25,332
(There are 4 pairs.)

2273
01:19:26,002 --> 01:19:27,532
I really wanted them.

2274
01:19:27,772 --> 01:19:29,271
Of course.

2275
01:19:29,272 --> 01:19:31,801
(The padded boots will warm them up when they go to work in winter.)

2276
01:19:31,802 --> 01:19:33,011
- We really want...
- Good luck.

2277
01:19:33,012 --> 01:19:34,741
To give the Round Two prize.

2278
01:19:34,742 --> 01:19:36,012
- Good luck.
- Let's go.

2279
01:19:37,342 --> 01:19:39,511
- What's Round Two?
- What are the rules?

2280
01:19:39,512 --> 01:19:40,751
(Round 2)

2281
01:19:40,752 --> 01:19:42,181
(Same as Round 1)

2282
01:19:42,182 --> 01:19:43,551
(However, )

2283
01:19:43,552 --> 01:19:45,852
(8 dice must be stacked.)

2284
01:19:46,452 --> 01:19:47,621
(8 dice?)

2285
01:19:47,622 --> 01:19:48,761
- All of us need to go again.
- All of us need to go again.

2286
01:19:48,762 --> 01:19:50,391
Hold on. We nearly ran out of time in the last round.

2287
01:19:50,392 --> 01:19:52,232
Is the time limit still 30 seconds?

2288
01:19:52,362 --> 01:19:54,231
- The difficulty level increased.
- Hold on.

2289
01:19:54,232 --> 01:19:55,331
- All of us need to go again.
- We need to go twice.

2290
01:19:55,332 --> 01:19:56,661
All of us need to go twice.

2291
01:19:56,662 --> 01:19:59,131
Then the difficulty level will skyrocket.

2292
01:19:59,132 --> 01:20:00,301
All of us need to go twice.

2293
01:20:00,302 --> 01:20:02,031
Is it even possible to stack that many dice?

2294
01:20:02,032 --> 01:20:03,301
I know.

2295
01:20:03,302 --> 01:20:06,312
- In 30 seconds...
- Is it even possible?

2296
01:20:06,412 --> 01:20:08,972
- Can someone else ring the bell?
- No, you must do it yourself.

2297
01:20:09,112 --> 01:20:11,382
- Then it should be...
- It should be here.

2298
01:20:12,212 --> 01:20:13,851
(Very hurried)

2299
01:20:13,852 --> 01:20:14,912
You're impatient.

2300
01:20:15,922 --> 01:20:17,251
Let's begin.

2301
01:20:17,252 --> 01:20:18,481
- Let's go.
- Okay.

2302
01:20:18,482 --> 01:20:20,551
- We have many tries left.
- Let's go.

2303
01:20:20,552 --> 01:20:21,821
In 1, 2, 3.

2304
01:20:21,822 --> 01:20:22,921
- Here we go!
- Here we go!

2305
01:20:22,922 --> 01:20:24,161
(Out of 10 total tries, they're on try number 2.)

2306
01:20:24,162 --> 01:20:25,362
Ready.

2307
01:20:25,492 --> 01:20:26,962
Let's go fast.

2308
01:20:27,292 --> 01:20:28,332
Set.

2309
01:20:35,942 --> 01:20:37,501
- Again.
- I'm sorry.

2310
01:20:37,502 --> 01:20:39,441
It's okay.

2311
01:20:39,442 --> 01:20:41,172
- I'm sorry.
- It's okay.

2312
01:20:42,482 --> 01:20:44,782
(I'm sorry.)

2313
01:20:45,042 --> 01:20:46,681
(It's okay.)

2314
01:20:46,682 --> 01:20:47,682
It's okay.

2315
01:20:48,182 --> 01:20:49,651
- I'm sorry.
- "I'm sorry."

2316
01:20:49,652 --> 01:20:51,081
(Quick failure and even quicker apology)

2317
01:20:51,082 --> 01:20:52,451
- I'm sorry.
- Many tries remain.

2318
01:20:52,452 --> 01:20:53,621
- I'm sorry.
- We'll do better.

2319
01:20:53,622 --> 01:20:55,191
We shouldn't be impatient.

2320
01:20:55,192 --> 01:20:57,091
- I was too impatient.
- You were too impatient.

2321
01:20:57,092 --> 01:20:58,421
Do it as you practiced earlier.

2322
01:20:58,422 --> 01:20:59,992
- I'll do that.
- Hold them vertically.

2323
01:21:00,062 --> 01:21:02,031
Let's give it the third try.

2324
01:21:02,032 --> 01:21:03,331
In 1, 2, 3.

2325
01:21:03,332 --> 01:21:04,332
- Here we go!
- Here we go!

2326
01:21:04,333 --> 01:21:05,731
- We can do it.
- Ready.

2327
01:21:05,732 --> 01:21:08,301
Hold on a second. Come on.

2328
01:21:08,302 --> 01:21:09,501
(Out of 10 total tries, they're on try number 3.)

2329
01:21:09,502 --> 01:21:10,502
Set.

2330
01:21:17,342 --> 01:21:18,441
Slowly.

2331
01:21:18,442 --> 01:21:20,452
(They're on the 3rd level.)

2332
01:21:22,982 --> 01:21:24,262
My hands are beginning to shake.

2333
01:21:26,122 --> 01:21:27,722
(They're on the 4th level.)

2334
01:21:28,622 --> 01:21:30,522
Hold on. Don't touch the table.

2335
01:21:30,962 --> 01:21:32,292
He's right. The table shakes.

2336
01:21:36,432 --> 01:21:37,832
- All right.
- Let's go.

2337
01:21:38,602 --> 01:21:39,972
- Gosh.
- Ten seconds.

2338
01:21:41,132 --> 01:21:42,202
We don't have enough time.

2339
01:21:43,042 --> 01:21:44,242
We don't have enough time.

2340
01:21:44,402 --> 01:21:46,272
- Five, four...
- Slowly.

2341
01:21:46,372 --> 01:21:47,542
Si Ah.

2342
01:21:48,912 --> 01:21:50,112
- Slowly.
- Four...

2343
01:21:50,382 --> 01:21:52,682
Si Ah, put it down gently.

2344
01:21:53,282 --> 01:21:55,551
- What are we going to do?
- It's okay.

2345
01:21:55,552 --> 01:21:56,651
I'm sorry.

2346
01:21:56,652 --> 01:21:58,551
The difficulty level is high.

2347
01:21:58,552 --> 01:22:02,662
Whenever we succeed in Round One quickly...

2348
01:22:03,192 --> 01:22:05,561
- The difficulty level goes up...
- Oh, no.

2349
01:22:05,562 --> 01:22:06,932
For Rounds 2 and 3.

2350
01:22:07,262 --> 01:22:09,561
(The problem solver becomes intimidated.)

2351
01:22:09,562 --> 01:22:10,632
This isn't easy.

2352
01:22:10,932 --> 01:22:12,201
- In that case, - The system...

2353
01:22:12,202 --> 01:22:13,431
let's change the order.

2354
01:22:13,432 --> 01:22:14,501
- Then...
- Then I'll go...

2355
01:22:14,502 --> 01:22:15,741
- Go first.
- Okay.

2356
01:22:15,742 --> 01:22:17,102
- Thank you.
- And...

2357
01:22:18,172 --> 01:22:19,771
(Si Ah will take the easiest levels, the 1st and 5th levels.)

2358
01:22:19,772 --> 01:22:21,311
- Young Woo, try going last.
- Okay.

2359
01:22:21,312 --> 01:22:22,381
- Okay.
- That'll be better.

2360
01:22:22,382 --> 01:22:23,442
(Gosh!)

2361
01:22:24,112 --> 01:22:25,181
Be careful.

2362
01:22:25,182 --> 01:22:27,712
(He's unaware of his surroundings due to nervousness.)

2363
01:22:27,952 --> 01:22:28,952
All right.

2364
01:22:30,552 --> 01:22:32,122
- Let's do well.
- Okay.

2365
01:22:32,222 --> 01:22:33,752
- Let's go.
- It's our fourth try.

2366
01:22:33,852 --> 01:22:35,052
Our fourth try.

2367
01:22:35,662 --> 01:22:39,362
It's our 4th try. When we succeed in Round 1 quickly...

2368
01:22:39,592 --> 01:22:41,791
- I know. The difficulty level...
- We need to snap out of it.

2369
01:22:41,792 --> 01:22:43,501
The difficulty level skyrockets.

2370
01:22:43,502 --> 01:22:44,502
(They changed their seats to turn over a new leaf.)

2371
01:22:44,503 --> 01:22:46,432
This is...

2372
01:22:46,602 --> 01:22:48,131
In 1, 2, 3.

2373
01:22:48,132 --> 01:22:49,201
- Here we go!
- Here we go!

2374
01:22:49,202 --> 01:22:51,142
Ready. Set.

2375
01:23:08,522 --> 01:23:11,822
(They quickly stack the 4th level.)

2376
01:23:13,262 --> 01:23:14,632
(Faltering)

2377
01:23:19,602 --> 01:23:21,101
Ten, nine,

2378
01:23:21,102 --> 01:23:22,741
- eight, - Let's keep going even if we fail.

2379
01:23:22,742 --> 01:23:24,841
Seven, six,

2380
01:23:24,842 --> 01:23:26,741
five, four.

2381
01:23:26,742 --> 01:23:30,812
Three, two, one.

2382
01:23:33,482 --> 01:23:35,152
(They failed.)

2383
01:23:35,922 --> 01:23:37,252
(Gosh, Young Woo...)

2384
01:23:37,422 --> 01:23:39,092
(He keeps going until the end.)

2385
01:23:39,592 --> 01:23:41,952
(It's too late, but they succeed in stacking 8 levels.)

2386
01:23:43,062 --> 01:23:44,692
It's a success.

2387
01:23:45,022 --> 01:23:46,562
- I...
- They can do it.

2388
01:23:46,632 --> 01:23:49,031
I was holding the die...

2389
01:23:49,032 --> 01:23:50,702
before Yeon Seok let go.

2390
01:23:50,962 --> 01:23:52,131
I didn't want to be disqualified.

2391
01:23:52,132 --> 01:23:53,731
(It's a foul to hold the die ahead of time.)

2392
01:23:53,732 --> 01:23:54,732
(He starts over.)

2393
01:23:56,242 --> 01:23:59,572
(He failed instead of getting disqualified.)

2394
01:23:59,812 --> 01:24:02,711
- That was why I let go.
- It's too bad.

2395
01:24:02,712 --> 01:24:04,141
- We were so close.
- I think we'll succeed in it.

2396
01:24:04,142 --> 01:24:05,811
- I think we'll succeed in it.
- Time is the problem.

2397
01:24:05,812 --> 01:24:08,852
- Let's keep going in this order.
- Okay.

2398
01:24:09,582 --> 01:24:10,622
(Breathing out)

2399
01:24:12,222 --> 01:24:14,021
The nervousness I feel...

2400
01:24:14,022 --> 01:24:15,392
is no joke.

2401
01:24:16,062 --> 01:24:17,921
It's extremely nerve-racking.

2402
01:24:17,922 --> 01:24:19,232
- It's...
- Right now...

2403
01:24:19,432 --> 01:24:20,631
How is it?

2404
01:24:20,632 --> 01:24:24,162
- For real, I'm very nervous.
- Practice.

2405
01:24:25,062 --> 01:24:26,702
I can't breathe.

2406
01:24:27,532 --> 01:24:28,571
Let's give it a go.

2407
01:24:28,572 --> 01:24:30,141
- Is it our fifth try?
- Yes.

2408
01:24:30,142 --> 01:24:32,202
- In one...
- Please wait.

2409
01:24:33,542 --> 01:24:36,181
- I...
- Don't hold it so short.

2410
01:24:36,182 --> 01:24:38,111
- Right?
- Si Ah, you're doing well.

2411
01:24:38,112 --> 01:24:39,911
- Si Ah, that's good.
- Okay.

2412
01:24:39,912 --> 01:24:41,881
Shall we begin right away?

2413
01:24:41,882 --> 01:24:42,882
All right.

2414
01:24:43,222 --> 01:24:44,551
Here we go.

2415
01:24:44,552 --> 01:24:46,391
- In 1, 2, 3. Here we go!
- Here we go.

2416
01:24:46,392 --> 01:24:47,722
- Ready. No.
- Wait.

2417
01:24:48,352 --> 01:24:49,421
- Here we go!
- Here we go.

2418
01:24:49,422 --> 01:24:50,561
- Ready. No.
- Wait.

2419
01:24:50,562 --> 01:24:51,562
(She has an early start.)

2420
01:24:51,563 --> 01:24:52,891
- Si Ah is pressed for time.
- Si Ah...

2421
01:24:52,892 --> 01:24:54,091
- is pressed for time.
- Si Ah is...

2422
01:24:54,092 --> 01:24:56,901
- I'm so intimidated.
- She used to be a problem solver.

2423
01:24:56,902 --> 01:24:59,102
- You can do it.
- She used to be a problem solver.

2424
01:24:59,372 --> 01:25:01,301
- Hold on. Let me try it once.
- Okay.

2425
01:25:01,302 --> 01:25:02,472
- I'm ready.
- Okay.

2426
01:25:02,602 --> 01:25:04,602
- Shall we begin?
- Here we go!

2427
01:25:05,672 --> 01:25:07,642
(Out of 10 total tries, they're on try number 5.)

2428
01:25:07,972 --> 01:25:09,782
Ready. Set.

2429
01:25:17,522 --> 01:25:19,222
This is so nerve-racking.

2430
01:25:21,922 --> 01:25:23,322
- They aren't aligned.
- It's okay.

2431
01:25:25,122 --> 01:25:26,432
A bit to your side.

2432
01:25:26,792 --> 01:25:29,032
(The dice tower is a bit tilted.)

2433
01:25:29,562 --> 01:25:31,202
(Gosh!)

2434
01:25:31,962 --> 01:25:33,802
A bit to the right.

2435
01:25:34,272 --> 01:25:37,301
(He balances the tower by going in the opposite direction.)

2436
01:25:37,302 --> 01:25:39,372
- I put it a bit to the right.
- Okay.

2437
01:25:41,812 --> 01:25:42,812
Ten.

2438
01:25:43,112 --> 01:25:44,281
- You can do it.
- Slowly.

2439
01:25:44,282 --> 01:25:46,052
- Young Woo, you have time.
- You can do it.

2440
01:25:46,382 --> 01:25:48,852
(He's at the 8th level.)

2441
01:25:50,252 --> 01:25:51,951
(You have enough time!)

2442
01:25:51,952 --> 01:25:54,052
- It's almost time.
- You can do it.

2443
01:25:54,122 --> 01:25:55,151
You can do it.

2444
01:25:55,152 --> 01:25:57,491
Five, four, three...

2445
01:25:57,492 --> 01:25:59,791
- My goodness.
- Oh, no.

2446
01:25:59,792 --> 01:26:00,862
I'm sorry.

2447
01:26:01,262 --> 01:26:02,501
Three...

2448
01:26:02,502 --> 01:26:04,832
(They failed.)

2449
01:26:05,302 --> 01:26:07,572
(We were so close.)

2450
01:26:07,702 --> 01:26:10,142
- I'm sorry.
- It's okay. We did so well.

2451
01:26:10,472 --> 01:26:11,502
We can do it.

2452
01:26:11,572 --> 01:26:13,541
- I'm sorry.
- We had enough time.

2453
01:26:13,542 --> 01:26:14,911
I know. We had enough time.

2454
01:26:14,912 --> 01:26:16,792
- Shall we switch places?
- Yes, I'd love that.

2455
01:26:17,682 --> 01:26:20,252
You know, it's really nerve-racking.

2456
01:26:21,612 --> 01:26:22,651
You haven't felt this way...

2457
01:26:22,652 --> 01:26:24,221
- in a while, right?
- That's right. It has been a while.

2458
01:26:24,222 --> 01:26:25,982
(They haven't been this nervous in a while.)

2459
01:26:26,392 --> 01:26:27,721
We were so close.

2460
01:26:27,722 --> 01:26:28,991
The 7th and 8th levels...

2461
01:26:28,992 --> 01:26:31,091
- Let's go. Is it our sixth try?
- Let's go.

2462
01:26:31,092 --> 01:26:32,212
- The sixth try.
- Let's go.

2463
01:26:32,362 --> 01:26:34,031
- Let's succeed in it.
- Okay.

2464
01:26:34,032 --> 01:26:35,131
In 1, 2, 3.

2465
01:26:35,132 --> 01:26:36,331
- Let's go!
- Let's go!

2466
01:26:36,332 --> 01:26:38,078
(Out of 10 total tries, they're on try number 6.)

2467
01:26:38,102 --> 01:26:41,272
- Ready.
- Please wait.

2468
01:26:42,032 --> 01:26:44,602
Si Ah keeps doing that.

2469
01:26:45,372 --> 01:26:46,442
- Okay.
- Okay.

2470
01:26:46,542 --> 01:26:48,241
Ready. Set.

2471
01:26:48,242 --> 01:26:49,442
(Her chopsticks are in place.)

2472
01:26:53,012 --> 01:26:54,212
Oh, my. Hold on.

2473
01:26:56,882 --> 01:26:58,252
(They're at the 3rd level.)

2474
01:26:59,822 --> 01:27:02,152
(They build up the 4th level.)

2475
01:27:05,122 --> 01:27:06,832
Good.

2476
01:27:10,132 --> 01:27:11,212
(They're at the 6th level.)

2477
01:27:12,132 --> 01:27:13,452
- How many seconds remain?
- Ten.

2478
01:27:14,102 --> 01:27:15,272
Slowly.

2479
01:27:16,042 --> 01:27:18,202
(His hands begin to shake.)

2480
01:27:19,102 --> 01:27:20,212
This won't work.

2481
01:27:21,442 --> 01:27:22,642
(I think we'll succeed in it!)

2482
01:27:23,142 --> 01:27:24,442
It's really nerve-racking.

2483
01:27:24,882 --> 01:27:25,882
- It's okay.
- How many seconds remain?

2484
01:27:25,883 --> 01:27:27,851
- Five, four, - I'm sorry.

2485
01:27:27,852 --> 01:27:29,782
Three, two...

2486
01:27:29,982 --> 01:27:31,622
It's okay.

2487
01:27:32,552 --> 01:27:35,522
Three, two, one.

2488
01:27:37,122 --> 01:27:38,192
I'm sorry.

2489
01:27:38,922 --> 01:27:40,832
(They failed.)

2490
01:27:41,262 --> 01:27:43,102
I wish we had five more seconds.

2491
01:27:43,332 --> 01:27:45,232
- Okay.
- That'd be nice.

2492
01:27:46,432 --> 01:27:49,501
- It's okay.
- It's okay.

2493
01:27:49,502 --> 01:27:51,771
We have three tries left.

2494
01:27:51,772 --> 01:27:53,472
I'm sweating so much.

2495
01:27:54,372 --> 01:27:55,511
(He gets a reality check.)

2496
01:27:55,512 --> 01:27:57,182
- Same here.
- We have three tries left.

2497
01:27:57,442 --> 01:27:59,082
- Three tries.
- Three tries.

2498
01:27:59,412 --> 01:28:00,881
It's okay. Three tries are a lot.

2499
01:28:00,882 --> 01:28:02,382
- We can do it.
- Of course.

2500
01:28:03,122 --> 01:28:05,051
- We're nearly there.
- That's right.

2501
01:28:05,052 --> 01:28:07,722
- Let's begin right away.
- I have a cramp.

2502
01:28:09,792 --> 01:28:11,421
Because we've done this for a while...

2503
01:28:11,422 --> 01:28:12,731
(His body goes into overdrive because he's so nervous.)

2504
01:28:12,732 --> 01:28:14,132
It's nerve-racking.

2505
01:28:14,932 --> 01:28:16,361
I feel like I've lost 5 years of my life.

2506
01:28:16,362 --> 01:28:17,831
I know.

2507
01:28:17,832 --> 01:28:20,372
Jae Suk, you breathe too hard through your nose.

2508
01:28:21,302 --> 01:28:23,671
- It isn't my fault.
- Seriously.

2509
01:28:23,672 --> 01:28:25,602
- The desk shakes too much.
- Seriously.

2510
01:28:25,702 --> 01:28:27,672
Don't put your hands on it. Don't touch it.

2511
01:28:27,772 --> 01:28:29,788
- Don't touch it.
- As long as you don't shake it...

2512
01:28:29,812 --> 01:28:31,741
- Let's go.
- I think we can do it.

2513
01:28:31,742 --> 01:28:32,911
- We can do it.
- We can do it.

2514
01:28:32,912 --> 01:28:36,022
You don't need to hold it. It's okay.

2515
01:28:36,352 --> 01:28:38,051
- We'll succeed in it.
- All right.

2516
01:28:38,052 --> 01:28:39,321
Is this better?

2517
01:28:39,322 --> 01:28:41,991
Let's begin our eighth try.

2518
01:28:41,992 --> 01:28:44,391
- Okay. I'm ready - All right. The eighth try.

2519
01:28:44,392 --> 01:28:45,991
Let's succeed in Round Two.

2520
01:28:45,992 --> 01:28:47,691
- In 1, 2, 3. Here we go!
- Here we go!

2521
01:28:47,692 --> 01:28:48,908
(Let's finish it with this try!)

2522
01:28:48,932 --> 01:28:50,231
- Ready.
- Please wait.

2523
01:28:50,232 --> 01:28:51,302
Okay.

2524
01:28:51,602 --> 01:28:53,331
- It's her routine.
- Are we...

2525
01:28:53,332 --> 01:28:55,732
in a time loop or something? We keep doing the same thing.

2526
01:28:55,972 --> 01:28:57,042
It's her routine.

2527
01:28:57,142 --> 01:28:58,242
- All done.
- Okay.

2528
01:28:58,342 --> 01:29:00,212
- Ready. Set.
- Okay. Let's go.

2529
01:29:07,460 --> 01:29:09,320
(They quickly stack 3 levels.)

2530
01:29:16,000 --> 01:29:18,300
(Yeon Seok's hand suddenly begins to shake.)

2531
01:29:22,100 --> 01:29:23,940
(Chuckling)

2532
01:29:24,740 --> 01:29:26,580
(Laughing)

2533
01:29:29,950 --> 01:29:33,420
- I must be crazy.
- It's okay.

2534
01:29:34,080 --> 01:29:36,050
(It's time to stack the 5th level.)

2535
01:29:36,620 --> 01:29:38,650
(Barely standing)

2536
01:29:41,760 --> 01:29:43,360
(Of course, they failed.)

2537
01:29:45,260 --> 01:29:46,429
Come here.

2538
01:29:46,430 --> 01:29:47,829
- Yeon Seok, what was that?
- Why...

2539
01:29:47,830 --> 01:29:48,860
I mean...

2540
01:29:49,600 --> 01:29:52,330
- Why did your hands shake?
- I don't know.

2541
01:29:53,000 --> 01:29:55,000
(Let's rewatch the funny scene again.)

2542
01:29:56,270 --> 01:29:59,010
(His hand shook like a leaf.)

2543
01:30:00,480 --> 01:30:03,750
(Poor-quality construction work)

2544
01:30:03,850 --> 01:30:06,280
- Why did your hands shake?
- I still stacked it.

2545
01:30:06,620 --> 01:30:07,649
Come here.

2546
01:30:07,650 --> 01:30:08,719
(They switch places.)

2547
01:30:08,720 --> 01:30:10,819
That was... For goodness' sake.

2548
01:30:10,820 --> 01:30:12,380
(He gets demoted in a ruthless manner.)

2549
01:30:12,520 --> 01:30:13,520
All right.

2550
01:30:14,120 --> 01:30:15,689
- Young Woo, do you want to go last?
- Okay.

2551
01:30:15,690 --> 01:30:16,860
All right.

2552
01:30:17,360 --> 01:30:18,360
Young Woo is good.

2553
01:30:18,361 --> 01:30:19,959
Young Woo is good, so he'll go last.

2554
01:30:19,960 --> 01:30:22,200
- Let's succeed in it.
- Only two tries remain.

2555
01:30:22,860 --> 01:30:25,330
- This is...
- We need to succeed in it now.

2556
01:30:25,670 --> 01:30:27,339
- If it's the last try, - We need to do it now.

2557
01:30:27,340 --> 01:30:28,469
- our hands will shake too much.
- We need to succeed in it now.

2558
01:30:28,470 --> 01:30:30,546
- Seriously. Let's cheer up.
- Let's bring our hands together.

2559
01:30:30,570 --> 01:30:31,730
We need to succeed in it now.

2560
01:30:31,940 --> 01:30:34,079
- In 1, 2, 3. Let's go!
- Let's go!

2561
01:30:34,080 --> 01:30:35,209
(They bring their energy together!)

2562
01:30:35,210 --> 01:30:36,210
All right.

2563
01:30:38,050 --> 01:30:39,479
- All right.
- By the way...

2564
01:30:39,480 --> 01:30:41,079
- By the way, - My body aches.

2565
01:30:41,080 --> 01:30:42,719
- is it okay to turn the table?
- Let's turn the table.

2566
01:30:42,720 --> 01:30:43,919
This way, the bowl is too far for some people.

2567
01:30:43,920 --> 01:30:45,290
- Can we turn it?
- Let's turn it.

2568
01:30:45,390 --> 01:30:46,719
- What?
- Like this.

2569
01:30:46,720 --> 01:30:48,520
- It'll be much better.
- My goodness.

2570
01:30:49,660 --> 01:30:51,689
- It'll be much more convenient.
- It's a good tip.

2571
01:30:51,690 --> 01:30:52,789
I mean...

2572
01:30:52,790 --> 01:30:54,729
- It's better.
- I like that it's close.

2573
01:30:54,730 --> 01:30:55,860
It's nice.

2574
01:30:55,960 --> 01:30:57,699
- It's better.
- Move out.

2575
01:30:57,700 --> 01:30:59,329
I'll give them room.

2576
01:30:59,330 --> 01:31:00,800
(She keeps a safe distance.)

2577
01:31:00,900 --> 01:31:02,339
- Good.
- I'm ready.

2578
01:31:02,340 --> 01:31:03,569
(They prepare themselves.)

2579
01:31:03,570 --> 01:31:04,570
- Here we go!
- Okay.

2580
01:31:04,610 --> 01:31:05,739
Ready.

2581
01:31:05,740 --> 01:31:07,556
(Out of 10 total tries, they're on try number 9.)

2582
01:31:07,580 --> 01:31:08,580
Set.

2583
01:31:13,550 --> 01:31:15,580
(They work faster since the soup bowl is closer.)

2584
01:31:16,690 --> 01:31:18,750
Hold on. I got it.

2585
01:31:19,920 --> 01:31:22,120
(They stack 4 levels in 10 seconds.)

2586
01:31:23,230 --> 01:31:24,690
Go slowly. We have a lot of time.

2587
01:31:38,340 --> 01:31:39,340
Ten seconds.

2588
01:31:40,410 --> 01:31:41,839
- Ten seconds.
- Go slowly. You have a lot of time.

2589
01:31:41,840 --> 01:31:43,310
You have a lot of time.

2590
01:31:45,210 --> 01:31:46,949
(They just need to stack one more die.)

2591
01:31:46,950 --> 01:31:48,280
You have a lot of time.

2592
01:31:50,320 --> 01:31:52,120
You have a lot of time.

2593
01:31:55,360 --> 01:31:58,089
- I can't believe it!
- Yes!

2594
01:31:58,090 --> 01:31:59,630
Young Woo!

2595
01:32:00,660 --> 01:32:03,830
(They succeed in stacking 8 dice.)

2596
01:32:06,330 --> 01:32:07,370
I can't believe it!

2597
01:32:07,840 --> 01:32:11,110
(A Christmas miracle finally came to them.)

2598
01:32:12,040 --> 01:32:16,180
(They created a miracle together.)

2599
01:32:17,210 --> 01:32:19,609
(Dancing)

2600
01:32:19,610 --> 01:32:22,380
- Round Two is a success.
- A success.

2601
01:32:24,890 --> 01:32:25,890
That's right.

2602
01:32:27,060 --> 01:32:28,989
Young Woo did it.

2603
01:32:28,990 --> 01:32:31,060
- My goodness.
- Young Woo did it.

2604
01:32:32,090 --> 01:32:35,330
(He made so many mistakes as if he was in a trance.)

2605
01:32:36,330 --> 01:32:40,070
(Choo Weak Link had a mental breakdown.)

2606
01:32:41,240 --> 01:32:43,440
(But in the most important moment, )

2607
01:32:44,570 --> 01:32:46,909
(he was reborn as Choo Hero.)

2608
01:32:46,910 --> 01:32:48,139
- Young Woo did it.
- It was incredible.

2609
01:32:48,140 --> 01:32:49,950
- Well done.
- Seriously.

2610
01:32:50,510 --> 01:32:51,949
- It was so nerve-racking.
- We did it.

2611
01:32:51,950 --> 01:32:53,750
- My goodness.
- My goodness.

2612
01:32:54,380 --> 01:32:56,450
- Turning the table helped.
- Thank you.

2613
01:32:56,720 --> 01:32:57,849
Seriously.

2614
01:32:57,850 --> 01:32:59,119
- It was a crucial touch.
- It's all thanks to you.

2615
01:32:59,120 --> 01:33:00,819
- Then the soup bowl wasn't so far.
- I know.

2616
01:33:00,820 --> 01:33:01,859
- Yes.
- We could focus.

2617
01:33:01,860 --> 01:33:03,690
- How many tries remain?
- One try remains.

2618
01:33:03,930 --> 01:33:05,090
- Then...
- This time...

2619
01:33:05,190 --> 01:33:06,390
- Stop.
- Stop.

2620
01:33:09,360 --> 01:33:11,770
We succeeded in Round Two,

2621
01:33:12,100 --> 01:33:15,639
so they'll receive massagers and winter boots as presents.

2622
01:33:15,640 --> 01:33:16,839
(Round 1 prize: Massagers, Round 2 prize: Winter boots)

2623
01:33:16,840 --> 01:33:18,139
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

2624
01:33:18,140 --> 01:33:21,409
The day after tomorrow is Christmas.

2625
01:33:21,410 --> 01:33:23,109
- Yes.
- Seriously...

2626
01:33:23,110 --> 01:33:24,650
Merry Christmas.

2627
01:33:24,810 --> 01:33:26,279
We'll see you next year.

2628
01:33:26,280 --> 01:33:29,250
- Happy New Year.
- Happy New Year.

2629
01:33:29,620 --> 01:33:30,850
Thank you.

2630
01:33:32,490 --> 01:33:35,660
(Kim Do Hoon's first visit to Whenever Possible)

2631
01:33:35,820 --> 01:33:38,059
(The new year of 2026)

2632
01:33:38,060 --> 01:33:40,630
(The first Whenever Friends)

2633
01:33:40,700 --> 01:33:42,799
(Cha Tae Hyun's fourth visit)

2634
01:33:42,800 --> 01:33:44,469
(I have a bad feeling about this.)

2635
01:33:44,470 --> 01:33:46,330
(Would you please let it slide this once?)

2636
01:33:46,530 --> 01:33:48,039
(On his first visit to the show, )

2637
01:33:48,040 --> 01:33:51,640
(he has a traumatic experience that'll last a lifetime.)

2638
01:33:52,310 --> 01:33:53,810
(After all, )

2639
01:33:53,840 --> 01:33:55,640
(it's my first visit to the show.)

2640
01:33:55,710 --> 01:33:57,509
(It's okay. We can blame Jae Suk if we fail.)

2641
01:33:57,510 --> 01:33:58,549
(It has nothing to do with us.)

2642
01:33:58,550 --> 01:33:59,649
(I want to pour jjamppong soup on him.)

2643
01:33:59,650 --> 01:34:01,296
(Shall I pour spicy jjamppong soup on him?)

2644
01:34:01,320 --> 01:34:04,950
(Relaxed manner that comes from visiting the show 4 times)

2645
01:34:05,120 --> 01:34:07,560
(Is it normal for your body to shake like this?)

2646
01:34:07,790 --> 01:34:09,459
(Of course! It's really nerve-racking.)

2647
01:34:09,460 --> 01:34:11,059
(I'm bad at the actual game.)

2648
01:34:11,060 --> 01:34:12,089
(I'm good at the actual game.)

2649
01:34:12,090 --> 01:34:13,630
(Cha Tae Hyun is annoying as always.)

2650
01:34:13,730 --> 01:34:14,960
(Why did you wear gloves?)

2651
01:34:15,060 --> 01:34:17,269
(People think you're an eyesore.)

2652
01:34:17,270 --> 01:34:18,400
(Whatever! Shut it!)

2653
01:34:18,500 --> 01:34:19,900
(Giggling)

2654
01:34:20,240 --> 01:34:21,799
(The task of building bridges between the older members...)

2655
01:34:21,800 --> 01:34:24,410
(falls on Yeon Shik.)

2656
01:34:24,510 --> 01:34:26,169
(The new year of 2026)

2657

(The first episode of Whenever Possible in 2026)

2658
01:34:31,010 --> 01:34:32,110
He said it with confidence.

2659
01:34:32,210 --> 01:34:36,280
(The day that will overturn everything)

2660
01:34:36,350 --> 01:34:40,660
(Whenever Possible, Tuesday, January 6 at 9pm)
