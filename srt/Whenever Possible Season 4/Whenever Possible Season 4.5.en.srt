1
00:00:10,450 --> 00:00:12,660
It's been a while since we were last in Daejeon.

2
00:00:12,820 --> 00:00:15,089
Whenever I'm in Daejeon, bread...

3
00:00:15,090 --> 00:00:16,760
and KAIST come to mind.

4
00:00:16,860 --> 00:00:17,929
- I see. Why?
- It's nearby.

5
00:00:17,930 --> 00:00:19,160
Are you attending KAIST?

6
00:00:19,360 --> 00:00:20,360
Me?

7
00:00:20,760 --> 00:00:22,199
That doesn't sound right, does it?

8
00:00:22,200 --> 00:00:23,569
- Right.
- My friend actually goes there.

9
00:00:23,570 --> 00:00:24,799
- I see.
- Yes.

10
00:00:24,800 --> 00:00:26,839
- But not as a student.
- Okay.

11
00:00:26,840 --> 00:00:28,069
- My friend is a researcher.
- A researcher.

12
00:00:28,070 --> 00:00:30,010
Yes, my friend is a researcher at KAIST.

13
00:00:30,310 --> 00:00:32,480
Are you bragging that your friend is smart?

14
00:00:34,180 --> 00:00:35,979
- I didn't say I was smart.
- Exactly. But still.

15
00:00:35,980 --> 00:00:37,579
It sounded like you were bragging about your friend.

16
00:00:37,580 --> 00:00:38,819
Well, I could.

17
00:00:38,820 --> 00:00:40,979
You don't know any friends who go to KAIST?

18
00:00:40,980 --> 00:00:42,100
Do I have any friends there?

19
00:00:42,220 --> 00:00:43,319
No, but I know some people there.

20
00:00:43,320 --> 00:00:44,320
(Suddenly getting into a battle of who knows more people)

21
00:00:44,321 --> 00:00:45,459
- I know some people there.
- I see.

22
00:00:45,460 --> 00:00:46,820
- Yes.
- Like professors?

23
00:00:47,460 --> 00:00:48,490
(Annoyed)

24
00:00:49,290 --> 00:00:51,789
No, not professors. I just happen to know them.

25
00:00:51,790 --> 00:00:53,506
- The university president?
- The president?

26
00:00:53,530 --> 00:00:54,860
I've actually met...

27
00:00:55,030 --> 00:00:57,029
the university president on "You Quiz on the Block."

28
00:00:57,030 --> 00:00:58,269
- I see.
- I do know him.

29
00:00:58,270 --> 00:00:59,470
- Really?
- Yes.

30
00:01:00,200 --> 00:01:03,039
I heard we had two guests for today's episode.

31
00:01:03,040 --> 00:01:04,639
- You heard, right?
- They told me...

32
00:01:04,640 --> 00:01:06,509
- Right. They told us.
- earlier. Yes.

33
00:01:06,510 --> 00:01:07,779
I'm a huge fan.

34
00:01:07,780 --> 00:01:09,180
- Really?
- I really am.

35
00:01:09,510 --> 00:01:10,780
- They're here.
- What?

36
00:01:10,910 --> 00:01:12,119
- I see.
- SULLYOON is here.

37
00:01:12,120 --> 00:01:13,319
- My gosh. Wait.
- Hello.

38
00:01:13,320 --> 00:01:14,619
- Hello.
- Hello.

39
00:01:14,620 --> 00:01:16,450
- Hello.
- What a surprise, Haewon.

40
00:01:16,520 --> 00:01:18,089
- What a surprise?
- My gosh.

41
00:01:18,090 --> 00:01:19,319
- We're here to film with you.
- You look so different.

42
00:01:19,320 --> 00:01:21,020
- SULLYOON...
- Hello.

43
00:01:21,390 --> 00:01:23,160
- SULLYOON looks the same.
- Hello.

44
00:01:23,530 --> 00:01:25,899
- I almost didn't recognize you.
- I wanted to show you my new look.

45
00:01:25,900 --> 00:01:28,140
(Today's Whenever Friends: SULLYOON and Haewon of NMIXX)

46
00:01:28,900 --> 00:01:30,700
(She was born to be a star on variety shows.)

47
00:01:31,400 --> 00:01:33,069
("NMIXX's 'Blue Valentine' Ranks 1st on Weekly Chart")

48
00:01:33,070 --> 00:01:34,739
("NMIXX Launches World Tour in 11 Cities...")

49
00:01:34,740 --> 00:01:36,270
("After Winning 1st Place")

50
00:01:36,370 --> 00:01:38,780
(She's the leader and a powerful vocalist of NMIXX.)

51
00:01:38,880 --> 00:01:40,910
(The versatile idol star, Haewon)

52
00:01:41,480 --> 00:01:43,920
(She radiated even in the pledge video of winning 1st place.)

53
00:01:44,880 --> 00:01:47,250
(The eye-catching and visibly-striking fairy)

54
00:01:47,420 --> 00:01:49,290
(The beauty, SULLYOON)

55
00:01:49,420 --> 00:01:50,649
(Haewon and SULLYOON of NMIXX)

56
00:01:50,650 --> 00:01:51,790
Seriously. Let's sit down.

57
00:01:52,460 --> 00:01:53,559
- That's...
- My gosh, Haewon.

58
00:01:53,560 --> 00:01:54,859
- You've never gone blond before.
- I almost didn't...

59
00:01:54,860 --> 00:01:56,560
- recognize you.
- Right. Hello.

60
00:01:56,590 --> 00:01:58,629
- You look so different. SULLYOON...
- Right.

61
00:01:58,630 --> 00:02:00,329
- I look the same.
- Right. You have the same vibe.

62
00:02:00,330 --> 00:02:01,660
- Let's all sit down.
- Okay.

63
00:02:02,130 --> 00:02:04,370
Is there a reason you got your hair bleached?

64
00:02:04,700 --> 00:02:07,040
We held our first concert.

65
00:02:07,200 --> 00:02:08,960
- That's... Yes.
- Was it your solo concert?

66
00:02:09,170 --> 00:02:10,739
- I see.
- I wanted to show a different side.

67
00:02:10,740 --> 00:02:13,510
Your song, "Blue Valentine," did well.

68
00:02:13,610 --> 00:02:16,210
That's why I'm wearing blue today.

69
00:02:17,810 --> 00:02:19,380
Oh, right. Today... Wait.

70
00:02:19,520 --> 00:02:21,949
- Blue.
- Oh, the shirt.

71
00:02:21,950 --> 00:02:23,890
- Blue.
- Haewon. That's unnecessary.

72
00:02:24,120 --> 00:02:25,890
- Your outfit is more gray.
- Haewon.

73
00:02:26,160 --> 00:02:27,620
Haewon, you don't need to do that.

74
00:02:28,120 --> 00:02:29,259
Actually, you can see blue up here too.

75
00:02:29,260 --> 00:02:30,389
- No.
- I mean...

76
00:02:30,390 --> 00:02:32,530
- We can see the logo.
- I'm sorry.

77
00:02:32,700 --> 00:02:34,900
- You don't have to do that.
- Blue.

78
00:02:35,030 --> 00:02:36,599
SULLYOON, aren't you from Daejeon?

79
00:02:36,600 --> 00:02:37,669
I am.

80
00:02:37,670 --> 00:02:39,139
- Really?
- Yes. I was born and raised here.

81
00:02:39,140 --> 00:02:41,969
We came to Daejeon today for SULLYOON then.

82
00:02:41,970 --> 00:02:43,740
Daejeon is famous for three things.

83
00:02:43,970 --> 00:02:45,609
- Tell us.
- Sungsimdang,

84
00:02:45,610 --> 00:02:47,609
- Yes.
- KAIST, and SULLYOON.

85
00:02:47,610 --> 00:02:49,450
(And SULLYOON)

86
00:02:51,310 --> 00:02:53,549
- But that's not the official list.
- Right.

87
00:02:53,550 --> 00:02:55,350
That's what you're claiming, SULLYOON. Right?

88
00:02:57,150 --> 00:03:00,089
And SULLYOON had a nickname in school.

89
00:03:00,090 --> 00:03:01,520
- What was it?
- Seolreim?

90
00:03:02,020 --> 00:03:03,129
(Her Seolreim days)

91
00:03:03,130 --> 00:03:04,990
- Or Dishwasher.
- That's cute.

92
00:03:05,330 --> 00:03:06,460
Those nicknames suit her.

93
00:03:06,800 --> 00:03:07,930
Wait.

94
00:03:08,100 --> 00:03:10,430
Whenever Haewon stars on shows,

95
00:03:10,770 --> 00:03:13,000
- she always brings this product.
- Right.

96
00:03:13,040 --> 00:03:15,239
- I have a mini-me.
- Right.

97
00:03:15,240 --> 00:03:16,309
Please wait.

98
00:03:16,310 --> 00:03:18,110
Yes, the crispy and crunchy guy.

99
00:03:18,310 --> 00:03:19,739
It's the cereal from Post.

100
00:03:19,740 --> 00:03:21,779
(Haewon brought breakfast with her.)

101
00:03:21,780 --> 00:03:23,079
- Let's show them.
- By the way,

102
00:03:23,080 --> 00:03:25,479
I love having cereal for breakfast.

103
00:03:25,480 --> 00:03:27,150
- I love it too.
- Yes.

104
00:03:27,220 --> 00:03:28,580
- Isn't this great?
- Yes.

105
00:03:28,620 --> 00:03:30,050
I missed breakfast.

106
00:03:30,250 --> 00:03:32,149
I actually buy this product...

107
00:03:32,150 --> 00:03:33,590
and eat it at home.

108
00:03:34,190 --> 00:03:35,960
- My daughter loves this.
- My gosh.

109
00:03:36,160 --> 00:03:39,259
The milk gets tastier when the cereal melts.

110
00:03:39,260 --> 00:03:41,160
- That's right.
- That's right.

111
00:03:41,330 --> 00:03:43,290
- Chocolate milk.
- It turns into chocolate milk.

112
00:03:44,800 --> 00:03:46,739
It's crispy because it's three-layered.

113
00:03:46,740 --> 00:03:47,740
(Enjoying the crispy and sweet cereal)

114
00:03:47,741 --> 00:03:49,301
It's great to have this in the morning.

115
00:03:50,910 --> 00:03:52,340
It comes with a lot of cookies.

116
00:03:53,440 --> 00:03:54,880
- It's savory and sweet.
- Yes.

117
00:03:55,750 --> 00:03:56,779
A small New Year's present.

118
00:03:56,780 --> 00:03:57,809
- You can take it home.
- Gosh, you brought us a present.

119
00:03:57,810 --> 00:04:00,520
- My goodness. Thank you.
- Thank you.

120
00:04:00,680 --> 00:04:01,919
I was going to buy a new one.

121
00:04:01,920 --> 00:04:03,549
- I should have this for breakfast.
- I'll eat this at home.

122
00:04:03,550 --> 00:04:04,710
- Thank you.
- I get one too?

123
00:04:05,920 --> 00:04:07,289
- I love it.
- Why does my feel body warm...

124
00:04:07,290 --> 00:04:08,660
after a bowl of cereal?

125
00:04:09,560 --> 00:04:12,090
- We need to get going.
- Let's meet a Whenever Guest.

126
00:04:12,190 --> 00:04:13,959
The slots are getting filled in.

127
00:04:13,960 --> 00:04:15,359
(Cascading down)

128
00:04:15,360 --> 00:04:16,969
- Yes. We'll go to three places.
- Right. They're getting filled in.

129
00:04:16,970 --> 00:04:18,369
- Three places.
- Yes.

130
00:04:18,370 --> 00:04:20,370
The first Whenever Guest is Choi Myung Hyeon.

131
00:04:20,840 --> 00:04:23,440
"Don't you think love is actually from another planet?"

132
00:04:24,140 --> 00:04:25,909
- What?
- "In movies,"

133
00:04:25,910 --> 00:04:29,249
"they gladly take a bullet and die for the people they love."

134
00:04:29,250 --> 00:04:32,880
"But we can't find the right answer in math, physics, or chemistry."

135
00:04:33,050 --> 00:04:35,549
"Guys, tell us the right answer to me and my friends..."

136
00:04:35,550 --> 00:04:38,349
"as our dream is to find a girlfriend on campus."

137
00:04:38,350 --> 00:04:39,819
His friends?

138
00:04:39,820 --> 00:04:41,819
- Then are they students?
- Are they students?

139
00:04:41,820 --> 00:04:43,159
He wrote, "campus." So they must go to college.

140
00:04:43,160 --> 00:04:44,189
- College students.
- Right.

141
00:04:44,190 --> 00:04:46,399
He mentioned math and physics. Is he an engineering major?

142
00:04:46,400 --> 00:04:49,799
- Well, Daejeon is famous for...
- Could he be?

143
00:04:49,800 --> 00:04:51,529
- KAIST.
- KAIST.

144
00:04:51,530 --> 00:04:53,540
They might be studying math or physics.

145
00:04:54,500 --> 00:04:56,839
It's time. So let's get going.

146
00:04:56,840 --> 00:04:57,910
- Okay.
- Okay.

147
00:04:58,840 --> 00:04:59,909
It's okay as long as it's not windy.

148
00:04:59,910 --> 00:05:00,910
- Right.
- Yes.

149
00:05:00,911 --> 00:05:02,450
- It's quite sunny.
- But...

150
00:05:03,010 --> 00:05:04,279
we have a car today.

151
00:05:04,280 --> 00:05:06,649
- Right. Today...
- My gosh.

152
00:05:06,650 --> 00:05:09,690
- What? This is a luxury car.
- What? It's a luxury sedan.

153
00:05:10,850 --> 00:05:11,889
I'll drive.

154
00:05:11,890 --> 00:05:12,919
(Everyone is pop-eyed.)

155
00:05:12,920 --> 00:05:14,219
- My gosh.
- It's a high-end sedan.

156
00:05:14,220 --> 00:05:16,689
- It's not sponsored.
- It's not?

157
00:05:16,690 --> 00:05:18,029
- Thank you.
- It's not sponsored.

158
00:05:18,030 --> 00:05:20,329
- My gosh. This is...
- SULLYOON, get in the back.

159
00:05:20,330 --> 00:05:21,529
- My gosh.
- Thank you.

160
00:05:21,530 --> 00:05:23,230
- You got us...
- This car is amazing.

161
00:05:24,030 --> 00:05:26,339
I love it. Are you sure this isn't sponsored?

162
00:05:26,340 --> 00:05:27,699
- I mean...
- How come it's not sponsored?

163
00:05:27,700 --> 00:05:29,169
- It's a high-end car.
- It's a high-end car.

164
00:05:29,170 --> 00:05:30,409
- Exactly.
- You know?

165
00:05:30,410 --> 00:05:32,210
- My gosh.
- Seat belts.

166
00:05:32,710 --> 00:05:35,980
Coincidentally, there weren't other cars available.

167
00:05:36,350 --> 00:05:38,580
- So they rented this luxury car.
- What a luxury car.

168
00:05:39,380 --> 00:05:41,980
- Gosh, there's a mirror.
- There's a mirror in the back too.

169
00:05:43,220 --> 00:05:45,150
(Checking her looks)

170
00:05:45,820 --> 00:05:48,019
You know what? A large sedan is nice.

171
00:05:48,020 --> 00:05:49,059
(Navi Yoo is setting up.)

172
00:05:49,060 --> 00:05:50,559
- What a nice car.
- Right.

173
00:05:50,560 --> 00:05:51,860
I see. It just popped up.

174
00:05:52,530 --> 00:05:54,560
Okay. So it's...

175
00:05:55,030 --> 00:05:56,990
I'm sorry. But we still haven't hit the road yet?

176
00:05:57,070 --> 00:05:59,269
- I have to put on my seat belt.
- I'll just drive then.

177
00:05:59,270 --> 00:06:01,899
- I must put on my seat belt first.
- Come on.

178
00:06:01,900 --> 00:06:03,910
- It's for a safe ride.
- Why are you so slow?

179
00:06:04,270 --> 00:06:05,880
(Looking around)

180
00:06:05,980 --> 00:06:08,079
- It's right here.
- Well...

181
00:06:08,080 --> 00:06:10,780
- The emergency light.
- Come on.

182
00:06:11,350 --> 00:06:13,020
It's for our safety.

183
00:06:13,320 --> 00:06:15,480
- So I'm driving slowly.
- Come on.

184
00:06:15,850 --> 00:06:19,360
You guys sound like a couple in a long-term relationship.

185
00:06:19,760 --> 00:06:21,289
- So... Yes.
- Us two?

186
00:06:21,290 --> 00:06:23,159
- You guys are bickering.
- Yeon Seok is the stable partner.

187
00:06:23,160 --> 00:06:24,560
- Right.
- I see.

188
00:06:24,930 --> 00:06:27,060
- For variety shows.
- He's so frustrating.

189
00:06:28,460 --> 00:06:29,570
A long-term relationship.

190
00:06:31,500 --> 00:06:32,769
We're going to KAIST.

191
00:06:32,770 --> 00:06:34,900
Right. This place is huge.

192
00:06:35,470 --> 00:06:37,239
Are we meeting engineering majors?

193
00:06:37,240 --> 00:06:38,569
- Right. I think so.
- It sounded like...

194
00:06:38,570 --> 00:06:40,740
You know what? You have to be incredibly smart...

195
00:06:41,110 --> 00:06:42,649
to be able to attend this school.

196
00:06:42,650 --> 00:06:43,709
- Right.
- Exactly.

197
00:06:43,710 --> 00:06:44,779
You have to miss only 1 or 2 questions.

198
00:06:44,780 --> 00:06:45,919
My gosh. To attend here...

199
00:06:45,920 --> 00:06:47,149
It's not about the number of correct questions,

200
00:06:47,150 --> 00:06:48,619
- but incorrect questions.
- So listen.

201
00:06:48,620 --> 00:06:50,819
Their standards are on a national level.

202
00:06:50,820 --> 00:06:52,460
- Only those people come here.
- Right.

203
00:06:54,290 --> 00:06:55,560
They're so different from me.

204
00:06:56,290 --> 00:06:58,659
Not just you, but everyone in this car.

205
00:06:58,660 --> 00:06:59,700
Totally.

206
00:07:00,260 --> 00:07:02,730
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

207
00:07:03,030 --> 00:07:05,029
The afternoon is warmer than the morning.

208
00:07:05,030 --> 00:07:06,169
- I love it.
- Yes.

209
00:07:06,170 --> 00:07:07,539
- It's not that cold.
- It's nice and sunny now.

210
00:07:07,540 --> 00:07:08,600
My gosh.

211
00:07:09,370 --> 00:07:11,939
I tolerate cold weather better than hot weather.

212
00:07:11,940 --> 00:07:13,740
- I see.
- Yes.

213
00:07:14,540 --> 00:07:16,149
- That's fascinating.
- My gosh.

214
00:07:16,150 --> 00:07:18,979
You two went, "I see."

215
00:07:18,980 --> 00:07:20,349
- Their reaction is...
- It comes with their job.

216
00:07:20,350 --> 00:07:21,919
- Right.
- Is it like a habit?

217
00:07:21,920 --> 00:07:23,489
Idol stars develop this kind of habit.

218
00:07:23,490 --> 00:07:25,350
- I do this at home too.
- Right.

219
00:07:25,920 --> 00:07:27,690
"I see. Really?"

220
00:07:28,920 --> 00:07:31,460
My job gave me a habit too. I say, "I see" a lot.

221
00:07:32,330 --> 00:07:34,529
- "I see."
- "I see."

222
00:07:34,530 --> 00:07:35,560
"Anyway..."

223
00:07:35,900 --> 00:07:36,929
"Really?"

224
00:07:36,930 --> 00:07:38,430
(Giggling)

225
00:07:38,730 --> 00:07:41,570
Hold on. We have to go to Tae Yul Gwan.

226
00:07:42,140 --> 00:07:43,440
Where's Tae Yul Gwan?

227
00:07:43,570 --> 00:07:45,540
- We have to find Tae Yul Gwan.
- Where?

228
00:07:45,840 --> 00:07:47,609
- Tae Yul Gwan.
- Tae Yul Gwan.

229
00:07:47,610 --> 00:07:49,750
Tae Yul sounds like a popular baby name these days.

230
00:07:49,880 --> 00:07:51,150
- Tae Yul.
- Tae Yul.

231
00:07:51,250 --> 00:07:52,819
- Wait. Is it that kind of vibe?
- You know?

232
00:07:52,820 --> 00:07:53,880
Tae Yul.

233
00:07:54,050 --> 00:07:55,650
- What kind of vibe is that?
- If not...

234
00:07:56,050 --> 00:07:57,419
- Look at it. If not...
- Tae?

235
00:07:57,420 --> 00:07:58,789
- Tae?
- Yes.

236
00:07:58,790 --> 00:08:00,719
(They look for Tae Yul Gwan relying on their hunch.)

237
00:08:00,720 --> 00:08:02,489
- It's super windy.
- It's nice and cool.

238
00:08:02,490 --> 00:08:03,529
Wait.

239
00:08:03,530 --> 00:08:05,089
Is it Tae Wul Gwan?

240
00:08:05,090 --> 00:08:06,299
- Tae Yul Gwan.
- Tae Yul?

241
00:08:06,300 --> 00:08:08,059
I only see Tae Wul Gwan here.

242
00:08:08,060 --> 00:08:10,030
- Isn't it Tae Wul Gwan?
- That's it!

243
00:08:10,200 --> 00:08:11,729
- That's it?
- I see. That's the one.

244
00:08:11,730 --> 00:08:13,699
- This is the building.
- I see. It's written there.

245
00:08:13,700 --> 00:08:14,816
(They finally find Tae Wul Gwan.)

246
00:08:14,840 --> 00:08:16,869
Yeon Shik, you missed it when it was right in front of you.

247
00:08:16,870 --> 00:08:18,186
(Navi Yoo got lost when it was right in front of him.)

248
00:08:18,210 --> 00:08:20,610
- Come on.
- We all missed it.

249
00:08:20,810 --> 00:08:22,140
Besides, it's Tae Wul Gwan.

250
00:08:22,510 --> 00:08:23,949
(Shocked)

251
00:08:23,950 --> 00:08:25,050
It must be...

252
00:08:25,280 --> 00:08:26,780
It must be because of presbyopia.

253
00:08:27,350 --> 00:08:29,690
It's Tae Yul. I mean, it's Tae Wul, not Tae Yul.

254
00:08:29,990 --> 00:08:32,150
- The letters were tiny.
- So...

255
00:08:32,590 --> 00:08:33,920
It looked like Yul.

256
00:08:34,860 --> 00:08:36,160
Which floor was it?

257
00:08:36,290 --> 00:08:37,760
Was it the third floor?

258
00:08:38,390 --> 00:08:39,799
- Earlier...
- Let's see.

259
00:08:39,800 --> 00:08:41,630
No. It's Room 2110.

260
00:08:42,130 --> 00:08:44,400
- The second floor?
- I never told you the floor number.

261
00:08:45,100 --> 00:08:47,570
- What was it?
- Reacting quickly is your habit.

262
00:08:47,970 --> 00:08:49,539
Was it Room 2100?

263
00:08:49,540 --> 00:08:51,010
It's Room 2110.

264
00:08:51,110 --> 00:08:52,809
- Room 2110? That way?
- A telecommunications branch...

265
00:08:52,810 --> 00:08:55,209
- is set up in the building.
- Right. In school.

266
00:08:55,210 --> 00:08:56,709
- Right.
- That's crazy.

267
00:08:56,710 --> 00:08:57,750
How nice.

268
00:08:58,310 --> 00:08:59,549
What? There's an udon restaurant too.

269
00:08:59,550 --> 00:09:00,679
Wait. I can't name the restaurant.

270
00:09:00,680 --> 00:09:02,319
There is a telecommunications branch.

271
00:09:02,320 --> 00:09:04,520
- An udon restaurant is here.
- Udon sounds good.

272
00:09:04,720 --> 00:09:05,860
What's this healthcare room?

273
00:09:06,690 --> 00:09:08,719
(Haewon and SULLYOON excitedly look for Room 2110.)

274
00:09:08,720 --> 00:09:09,760
Be careful.

275
00:09:10,030 --> 00:09:12,006
She startled me. I thought she bumped into the door.

276
00:09:12,030 --> 00:09:13,360
Gosh, it's a general store.

277
00:09:14,300 --> 00:09:15,600
Did you find the room?

278
00:09:15,800 --> 00:09:17,170
Yes. It's that way.

279
00:09:18,970 --> 00:09:20,870
What did you think about my old comedy skit?

280
00:09:21,140 --> 00:09:22,476
- I see. This place...
- It's that way.

281
00:09:22,500 --> 00:09:24,409
Hold on. It was Room 2110, right?

282
00:09:24,410 --> 00:09:25,410
- Yes.
- Yes.

283
00:09:25,411 --> 00:09:27,110
- Room 2110.
- I think it's at the end.

284
00:09:27,440 --> 00:09:28,880
I think it's at the end of the hall.

285
00:09:30,650 --> 00:09:32,779
This is the place. Room 2110.

286
00:09:32,780 --> 00:09:34,579
- "Eunmak?"
- "Eunmak?"

287
00:09:34,580 --> 00:09:36,120
- This is the place.
- What is it?

288
00:09:36,720 --> 00:09:37,820
I see. This place...

289
00:09:38,420 --> 00:09:41,059
- My gosh.
- His name is Myung Hyeon.

290
00:09:41,060 --> 00:09:42,259
- Hello.
- Hello.

291
00:09:42,260 --> 00:09:44,360
- Hello.
- Hello.

292
00:09:44,930 --> 00:09:45,960
- What?
- Hello.

293
00:09:47,760 --> 00:09:49,429
- Nice to meet you.
- Hello.

294
00:09:49,430 --> 00:09:50,769
- My gosh. Oh, my.
- What?

295
00:09:50,770 --> 00:09:52,070
- Hello.
- Hello.

296
00:09:52,200 --> 00:09:53,269
- Hello.
- Hello.

297
00:09:53,270 --> 00:09:54,440
- What?
- Hello.

298
00:09:54,740 --> 00:09:55,770
What?

299
00:09:57,010 --> 00:09:58,670
- Hello.
- Hello.

300
00:09:59,110 --> 00:10:01,190
- You must be KAIST students.
- Yoo Jae Suk is here.

301
00:10:01,440 --> 00:10:03,186
- Why are you hitting your friend?
- Nice to meet you.

302
00:10:03,210 --> 00:10:04,410
- Hello.
- Hello.

303
00:10:04,810 --> 00:10:06,079
Your wish came true.

304
00:10:06,080 --> 00:10:08,056
Exactly. Who knew I'd get my Christmas present like this?

305
00:10:08,080 --> 00:10:09,649
(Restless)

306
00:10:09,650 --> 00:10:10,919
My gosh. Okay.

307
00:10:10,920 --> 00:10:12,760
- Why is your face so red?
- Nice to meet you.

308
00:10:12,820 --> 00:10:15,159
- Who's Myung Hyeon?
- It's this guy.

309
00:10:15,160 --> 00:10:16,290
I see. Myung Hyeon.

310
00:10:16,430 --> 00:10:17,959
- Should we sit down?
- Let's sit down.

311
00:10:17,960 --> 00:10:20,399
- Is this a club room or something?
- Yes, it is.

312
00:10:20,400 --> 00:10:22,400
(Lee Geon Hee, Choi Myung Hyeon, and Shin Ju Hyun)

313
00:10:22,430 --> 00:10:23,970
What kind of club is this?

314
00:10:24,200 --> 00:10:25,769
- We make films here.
- We make films.

315
00:10:25,770 --> 00:10:27,340
- You make films?
- Yes.

316
00:10:27,900 --> 00:10:28,939
I see.

317
00:10:28,940 --> 00:10:32,740
(Filming equipment takes up a corner of the club room.)

318
00:10:34,280 --> 00:10:35,540
- What now?
- This is crazy.

319
00:10:35,610 --> 00:10:37,910
- My gosh.
- No wonder why they didn't tell me.

320
00:10:39,980 --> 00:10:41,279
What were you guys doing?

321
00:10:41,280 --> 00:10:43,820
What were you talking about?

322
00:10:44,150 --> 00:10:46,550
It's kind of a secret. But we were talking about our grades.

323
00:10:47,690 --> 00:10:48,690
(The biggest topic, grades)

324
00:10:48,691 --> 00:10:50,929
Did your grades for the finals come out?

325
00:10:50,930 --> 00:10:52,699
- Yes. They came out yesterday.
- Yesterday?

326
00:10:52,700 --> 00:10:53,899
How did it go? Did you get good grades?

327
00:10:53,900 --> 00:10:54,900
(Curious)

328
00:10:54,901 --> 00:10:56,699
I don't think the first-year grades aren't that important.

329
00:10:56,700 --> 00:10:59,069
- I agree.
- Are you all in your first year?

330
00:10:59,070 --> 00:11:00,169
- I'm in my...
- It's our first year.

331
00:11:00,170 --> 00:11:01,240
I'm in my second year.

332
00:11:01,640 --> 00:11:03,940
You said the first-year grades weren't so important.

333
00:11:04,010 --> 00:11:05,510
We haven't declared our majors yet.

334
00:11:07,140 --> 00:11:09,039
- So you're undecided for now?
- Yes.

335
00:11:09,040 --> 00:11:10,449
We're undecided majors in our first year.

336
00:11:10,450 --> 00:11:11,809
We pick our majors in our second year.

337
00:11:11,810 --> 00:11:13,049
- Really?
- Yes.

338
00:11:13,050 --> 00:11:14,149
Have you two given it some thought?

339
00:11:14,150 --> 00:11:15,479
- About our major?
- Yes.

340
00:11:15,480 --> 00:11:18,320
Yes. I want to major in Brain and Cognitive Sciences.

341
00:11:18,620 --> 00:11:20,419
Brain and Cognitive Sciences?

342
00:11:20,420 --> 00:11:22,520
Yes. I applied to join that department.

343
00:11:22,590 --> 00:11:24,089
I want to major in Aerospace Engineering.

344
00:11:24,090 --> 00:11:25,490
- Aerospace Engineering?
- My gosh.

345
00:11:26,330 --> 00:11:27,929
I'm with the School of Transdisciplinary Studies.

346
00:11:27,930 --> 00:11:29,430
It only exists in KAIST.

347
00:11:29,930 --> 00:11:32,369
We can study any field we find interesting...

348
00:11:32,370 --> 00:11:34,370
and attend classes.

349
00:11:34,940 --> 00:11:37,369
You know what? You should take a look good at them.

350
00:11:37,370 --> 00:11:38,609
I mean, we will too.

351
00:11:38,610 --> 00:11:40,840
I bet one of them will be on the news.

352
00:11:41,440 --> 00:11:45,250
The news coverage will be about successful research by a scholar.

353
00:11:45,680 --> 00:11:46,750
They'll be on TV.

354
00:11:47,150 --> 00:11:49,220
- I'm serious.
- Right.

355
00:11:49,420 --> 00:11:51,750
We should get your names. What are your names?

356
00:11:52,420 --> 00:11:53,459
My name is Shin Ju Hyun.

357
00:11:53,460 --> 00:11:54,689
- Ju Hyun.
- Ju Hyun.

358
00:11:54,690 --> 00:11:56,129
- My name is Choi Myung Hyeon.
- Myung Hyeon.

359
00:11:56,130 --> 00:11:57,689
- My name is Lee Geon Hee.
- Geon Hee.

360
00:11:57,690 --> 00:11:58,830
Ju Hyun.

361
00:11:59,700 --> 00:12:01,199
- His name is...
- Right.

362
00:12:01,200 --> 00:12:03,600
My father gave me this name, so I would make a lot of money.

363
00:12:03,700 --> 00:12:04,930
- Really?
- Yes.

364
00:12:05,370 --> 00:12:06,670
- To make a lot of money.
- Yes.

365
00:12:07,340 --> 00:12:08,869
I'm also the club president.

366
00:12:08,870 --> 00:12:10,309
- You are? I knew it.
- So...

367
00:12:10,310 --> 00:12:12,010
President Lee Geon Hee.

368
00:12:12,910 --> 00:12:14,590
- I knew it.
- He's living up to his name.

369
00:12:17,710 --> 00:12:21,679
I can see this look on Myung Hyeon's face as we talk.

370
00:12:21,680 --> 00:12:23,150
I find that so cute.

371
00:12:24,290 --> 00:12:25,390
I find that so cute.

372
00:12:25,950 --> 00:12:28,319
- His eyes curve when he smiles.
- Right. It's his eyes.

373
00:12:28,320 --> 00:12:30,229
- He's like a cartoon character.
- It's so charming.

374
00:12:30,230 --> 00:12:32,030
- So charming.
- What's wrong with your eyes?

375
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:34,920
- "What's wrong?"
- What's wrong with your eyes?

376
00:12:35,100 --> 00:12:36,429
- You closed your eyes completely.
- His eyes...

377
00:12:36,430 --> 00:12:37,700
are closed. I mean...

378
00:12:38,500 --> 00:12:40,340
- Seriously.
- You're not doing it on purpose?

379
00:12:41,940 --> 00:12:43,169
- Gosh, the look on his face...
- Look at them.

380
00:12:43,170 --> 00:12:45,739
- It's a once-in-a-lifetime chance.
- That's the happiest look.

381
00:12:45,740 --> 00:12:47,309
Wait. Is he an NMIXX fan?

382
00:12:47,310 --> 00:12:48,539
- He's a huge fan.
- A huge fan.

383
00:12:48,540 --> 00:12:49,750
- Really?
- Really?

384
00:12:49,950 --> 00:12:51,479
- No wonder. He was so happy.
- Thank you.

385
00:12:51,480 --> 00:12:52,680
What a surprise to meet a fan.

386
00:12:52,750 --> 00:12:54,320
- No wonder.
- You're his favorite.

387
00:12:54,450 --> 00:12:55,450
(Cheering)

388
00:12:55,920 --> 00:12:57,090
You're his favorite.

389
00:12:57,220 --> 00:13:00,589
(His favorite idol star happens to be here too.)

390
00:13:00,590 --> 00:13:02,089
That explains the huge smile on your face.

391
00:13:02,090 --> 00:13:04,689
- He's loving it.
- This is just crazy.

392
00:13:04,690 --> 00:13:07,130
- Your face went like this.
- Yes. Like this.

393
00:13:07,700 --> 00:13:09,259
- He's elated.
- He's like a cartoon character.

394
00:13:09,260 --> 00:13:10,469
(Meeting his favorite star makes him dizzy.)

395
00:13:10,470 --> 00:13:12,499
The staff didn't tell us about the Whenever Friends.

396
00:13:12,500 --> 00:13:13,640
- Really?
- I see.

397
00:13:13,770 --> 00:13:15,346
How does it feel to meet them in person?

398
00:13:15,370 --> 00:13:16,740
I was so surprised.

399
00:13:18,710 --> 00:13:19,879
- That's good.
- Thank you.

400
00:13:19,880 --> 00:13:22,610
- He applied to be on our show.
- Right.

401
00:13:23,010 --> 00:13:24,850
- Gosh. That's...
- He's so innocent.

402
00:13:25,010 --> 00:13:27,149
- I love his eyes when he smiles.
- Right. He has a beautiful smile.

403
00:13:27,150 --> 00:13:30,790
You make that kind of expression when you're over the moon.

404
00:13:31,220 --> 00:13:32,289
(His friends have never seen him like this.)

405
00:13:32,290 --> 00:13:34,720
He has a one-of-a-kind smile.

406
00:13:34,960 --> 00:13:36,789
Did you have any questions for them...

407
00:13:36,790 --> 00:13:39,110
- For Haewon and SULLYOON.
- if you ever got to meet them?

408
00:13:39,700 --> 00:13:41,200
(Groaning)

409
00:13:41,360 --> 00:13:43,070
- Questions?
- Did you have any questions?

410
00:13:43,600 --> 00:13:45,970
(Trailing off)

411
00:13:47,240 --> 00:13:48,600
Are we putting him on the spot?

412
00:13:49,100 --> 00:13:51,840
When will you sing "Hey Gabby!" live?

413
00:13:52,880 --> 00:13:54,140
He's a real NSWER.

414
00:13:54,480 --> 00:13:56,209
- Right. He's a real NSWER.
- He's a real NSWER.

415
00:13:56,210 --> 00:13:58,009
In the early years of our career,

416
00:13:58,010 --> 00:14:00,156
- we sang an animation soundtrack.
- Right. It's a soundtrack.

417
00:14:00,180 --> 00:14:01,819
Our fans kept asking us to sing it.

418
00:14:01,820 --> 00:14:03,420
- But we never did.
- Right.

419
00:14:03,790 --> 00:14:05,989
I always hope you'd sing it when I go to fan-meets and concerts.

420
00:14:05,990 --> 00:14:07,660
- Really?
- "They might sing it today."

421
00:14:07,860 --> 00:14:09,390
- Did you come to our concert?
- Yes.

422
00:14:09,690 --> 00:14:11,289
- I'm a third-batch fan club member.
- Really?

423
00:14:11,290 --> 00:14:13,660
- He's a member of your fan club.
- He's a real fan then.

424
00:14:13,900 --> 00:14:15,000
With the third batch?

425
00:14:15,400 --> 00:14:17,000
So when will you sing the song?

426
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:19,329
Five, six, seven, eight.

427
00:14:19,330 --> 00:14:20,940
(Hey, Gabby)

428
00:14:21,570 --> 00:14:25,340
(A huge smile on his face)

429
00:14:28,710 --> 00:14:31,410
(A special treat just for Myung Hyeon)

430
00:14:31,910 --> 00:14:33,550
- You got to watch it in person.
- Right.

431
00:14:34,120 --> 00:14:35,679
When he asked them about the song,

432
00:14:35,680 --> 00:14:37,249
- they sang it right away.
- Right away.

433
00:14:37,250 --> 00:14:38,789
- Thank you.
- Our faces are getting red too.

434
00:14:38,790 --> 00:14:40,260
- Exactly.
- Is it just me?

435
00:14:41,220 --> 00:14:43,160
You mentioned briefly that you made films here.

436
00:14:43,390 --> 00:14:44,860
- Yes.
- We make films.

437
00:14:44,990 --> 00:14:46,299
- You make your own films?
- Yes.

438
00:14:46,300 --> 00:14:48,099
- You make films?
- Yes.

439
00:14:48,100 --> 00:14:49,430
Really?

440
00:14:49,670 --> 00:14:51,999
Then are you guys preparing to film another movie?

441
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:55,169
- I directed a movie last summer.
- Okay.

442
00:14:55,170 --> 00:14:57,740
He's going to direct a movie this winter.

443
00:14:59,070 --> 00:15:02,480
Could you tell us about your winter movie?

444
00:15:02,710 --> 00:15:03,879
- It's a comedy.
- Yes.

445
00:15:03,880 --> 00:15:05,380
Like I wrote in my letter,

446
00:15:05,480 --> 00:15:07,520
it's a comedy movie about love.

447
00:15:08,120 --> 00:15:09,949
When people write screenplays,

448
00:15:09,950 --> 00:15:13,120
they might use some of their experience for the plot.

449
00:15:13,490 --> 00:15:15,160
What about you, Myung Hyeon?

450
00:15:15,290 --> 00:15:17,729
Did this story about love have something to do...

451
00:15:17,730 --> 00:15:19,460
with your experience?

452
00:15:19,600 --> 00:15:24,030
It's like falling into delusion about something you can't have.

453
00:15:24,930 --> 00:15:26,439
Not being able to find love...

454
00:15:26,440 --> 00:15:27,940
Actually, the three of us...

455
00:15:28,140 --> 00:15:29,546
Have you guys been in relationships?

456
00:15:29,570 --> 00:15:31,530
The three of us have never been in relationships.

457
00:15:33,040 --> 00:15:35,709
- So we all have fantasies...
- Why did you tell them that?

458
00:15:35,710 --> 00:15:38,179
- about romance.
- The movie is about your fantasy?

459
00:15:38,180 --> 00:15:39,310
My fantasy...

460
00:15:40,080 --> 00:15:42,349
I'm a bit different from them.

461
00:15:42,350 --> 00:15:44,689
- How so?
- They have zero dating experience.

462
00:15:44,690 --> 00:15:48,390
But I have at least had some romantic feelings.

463
00:15:48,720 --> 00:15:50,390
- You had a situationship.
- I see.

464
00:15:50,590 --> 00:15:53,030
- So cute.
- You're very different from them?

465
00:15:53,060 --> 00:15:55,360
I can say that I've tried countless times.

466
00:15:56,530 --> 00:15:57,769
You've asked someone out?

467
00:15:57,770 --> 00:16:00,770
- No, I didn't.
- She's not so different.

468
00:16:01,470 --> 00:16:02,876
But she keeps trying to distance herself.

469
00:16:02,900 --> 00:16:05,009
Why don't you tell us in detail?

470
00:16:05,010 --> 00:16:06,479
- Can I?
- Yes.

471
00:16:06,480 --> 00:16:07,539
- You...
- The cat?

472
00:16:07,540 --> 00:16:09,340
- Do you want me to tell them?
- What's that?

473
00:16:09,480 --> 00:16:10,509
The cat?

474
00:16:10,510 --> 00:16:11,749
- What is it?
- I'm curious.

475
00:16:11,750 --> 00:16:14,019
- Right.
- We were filming our summer movie.

476
00:16:14,020 --> 00:16:16,049
- Okay.
- We were filming.

477
00:16:16,050 --> 00:16:18,120
During the break, she ran out.

478
00:16:18,220 --> 00:16:20,619
She was like, "Oh, my gosh!" Then she ran out.

479
00:16:20,620 --> 00:16:21,919
We didn't have much time.

480
00:16:21,920 --> 00:16:23,489
It was hot. It was a pressing moment.

481
00:16:23,490 --> 00:16:24,930
She suddenly ran...

482
00:16:25,130 --> 00:16:26,330
- and talked to a guy.
- What?

483
00:16:26,600 --> 00:16:28,200
She just ran out like that.

484
00:16:28,360 --> 00:16:31,699
I asked her what happened. So a week before our shoot,

485
00:16:31,700 --> 00:16:33,999
she was petting a cat. A man came over.

486
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:35,970
He asked if he could pet the cat with her.

487
00:16:36,040 --> 00:16:37,910
- Yes.
- The guy was her type.

488
00:16:38,170 --> 00:16:40,980
We were filming, but he walked past us.

489
00:16:41,110 --> 00:16:42,909
She abandoned all of us and ran to him.

490
00:16:42,910 --> 00:16:44,379
I didn't abandon you guys.

491
00:16:44,380 --> 00:16:46,619
- You did.
- We were on a break then.

492
00:16:46,620 --> 00:16:49,620
When I met him at night, he was stylish.

493
00:16:49,750 --> 00:16:52,449
- He was so mature and gentle.
- Yes.

494
00:16:52,450 --> 00:16:54,359
He also had a sweet voice.

495
00:16:54,360 --> 00:16:57,390
- Go on.
- He was totally my type.

496
00:16:57,460 --> 00:17:00,859
So you stopped filming the movie and ran to him?

497
00:17:00,860 --> 00:17:04,229
When we were filming, he walked past us like fate.

498
00:17:04,230 --> 00:17:07,069
I wanted to say hello. So I ran to him.

499
00:17:07,070 --> 00:17:08,169
Gosh, she's so brave.

500
00:17:08,170 --> 00:17:10,139
- My gosh. Truly.
- Yes.

501
00:17:10,140 --> 00:17:13,039
- I get why you thought it was fate.
- You thought it was fate.

502
00:17:13,040 --> 00:17:14,979
So did you say hello to him after running out?

503
00:17:14,980 --> 00:17:15,980
Yes. I asked,

504
00:17:15,981 --> 00:17:17,980
- "Do you remember me?"
- My gosh.

505
00:17:18,150 --> 00:17:19,279
- What did he say?
- What did he say?

506
00:17:19,280 --> 00:17:20,379
He said he did.

507
00:17:20,380 --> 00:17:22,250
- Go on.
- You didn't tell me about this.

508
00:17:22,380 --> 00:17:23,519
You didn't tell me about this.

509
00:17:23,520 --> 00:17:24,619
Go on.

510
00:17:24,620 --> 00:17:25,919
We said hello.

511
00:17:25,920 --> 00:17:28,020
I asked him what he was majoring in.

512
00:17:28,320 --> 00:17:30,030
That's it. I couldn't ask him his name.

513
00:17:30,530 --> 00:17:32,489
(Oh, no...)

514
00:17:32,490 --> 00:17:35,400
Have you met him again afterward?

515
00:17:35,630 --> 00:17:36,699
- No.
- Oh, no.

516
00:17:36,700 --> 00:17:38,430
- My gosh.
- That's a pity.

517
00:17:39,700 --> 00:17:41,270
This is really sad. You...

518
00:17:41,470 --> 00:17:43,570
- My gosh.
- If he remembers you...

519
00:17:43,740 --> 00:17:46,679
and happens to watch this show, he might find a way to reach you.

520
00:17:46,680 --> 00:17:49,410
- Leave a message to the cat guy.
- The cat guy?

521
00:17:49,710 --> 00:17:51,409
- He might be looking for you too.
- Right.

522
00:17:51,410 --> 00:17:52,680
- Totally.
- Yes.

523
00:17:53,010 --> 00:17:54,150
Hello.

524
00:17:54,380 --> 00:17:57,720
Do you remember the girl you petted the cat with?

525
00:17:58,790 --> 00:18:01,119
To be honest, I thought you were handsome.

526
00:18:01,120 --> 00:18:04,790
If we ever get to meet again, I'd like to say hello.

527
00:18:05,930 --> 00:18:07,030
Bye.

528
00:18:08,230 --> 00:18:09,300
Bye.

529
00:18:09,770 --> 00:18:10,869
So cute.

530
00:18:10,870 --> 00:18:12,029
(She was cute and honest in her video message.)

531
00:18:12,030 --> 00:18:14,100
- You're brave. I'll give you that.
- Seriously.

532
00:18:14,270 --> 00:18:15,900
- She's so cool.
- Seriously.

533
00:18:16,070 --> 00:18:18,410
- She's so cool.
- I'm certain that in 2026,

534
00:18:19,040 --> 00:18:21,010
- you two will end up together.
- Exactly.

535
00:18:21,310 --> 00:18:23,040
I'm 100 percent certain about that.

536
00:18:23,210 --> 00:18:25,309
- He might come here.
- Right.

537
00:18:25,310 --> 00:18:26,949
- To the film club.
- She's in a film club.

538
00:18:26,950 --> 00:18:29,249
- Cat Guy, come and find her here.
- It's a film club.

539
00:18:29,250 --> 00:18:31,720
- Yes. I'm sure he remembers her.
- Cat Guy.

540
00:18:32,750 --> 00:18:35,690
All right. Let's get started now.

541
00:18:36,090 --> 00:18:37,090
- I see.
- Right.

542
00:18:37,091 --> 00:18:38,460
- Let me try it.
- Okay.

543
00:18:38,830 --> 00:18:39,860
Great.

544
00:18:41,200 --> 00:18:42,359
(The numbers are from 0 to 2.)

545
00:18:42,360 --> 00:18:43,469
- It's okay.
- It's okay.

546
00:18:43,470 --> 00:18:44,790
(How many coupons will they win?)

547
00:18:45,130 --> 00:18:46,206
- As long as it's not zero...
- My gosh.

548
00:18:46,230 --> 00:18:48,299
- We can't get 2 coupons.
- Getting 1 is good enough.

549
00:18:48,300 --> 00:18:50,639
The last time we filmed our episode in Daejeon,

550
00:18:50,640 --> 00:18:52,339
- we weren't able to give presents.
- Right.

551
00:18:52,340 --> 00:18:53,679
I really want to give presents today.

552
00:18:53,680 --> 00:18:55,179
- Let's make sure of that.
- Yes.

553
00:18:55,180 --> 00:18:56,780
- I really want to give presents.
- Yes.

554
00:18:57,450 --> 00:18:59,950
All right. Let's start with Round One.

555
00:19:01,850 --> 00:19:02,949
"I'm making my debut as a director."

556
00:19:02,950 --> 00:19:04,919
"I need a new microphone to film my movie."

557
00:19:04,920 --> 00:19:06,249
"A boom microphone set."

558
00:19:06,250 --> 00:19:08,359
(Round 1 prize: A boom microphone set)

559
00:19:08,360 --> 00:19:09,360
A microphone set.

560
00:19:09,361 --> 00:19:12,330
(A boom microphone set to help him debut as a director)

561
00:19:12,730 --> 00:19:13,999
This is a really good one.

562
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:15,359
- That's helpful in filming movies.
- Right.

563
00:19:15,360 --> 00:19:16,530
We only have one now.

564
00:19:16,600 --> 00:19:17,699
You can use it...

565
00:19:17,700 --> 00:19:19,699
- when filming with two cameras.
- Right. We only have one now.

566
00:19:19,700 --> 00:19:20,739
We had to move the microphone.

567
00:19:20,740 --> 00:19:22,499
- I see.
- Then it'd create noise.

568
00:19:22,500 --> 00:19:24,639
Gosh, the director will get a new microphone.

569
00:19:24,640 --> 00:19:27,609
Hopefully, the guy who petted the cat reaches out...

570
00:19:27,610 --> 00:19:28,640
to Ju Hyun.

571
00:19:29,110 --> 00:19:30,209
You'll be rich.

572
00:19:30,210 --> 00:19:31,249
(Geon Hee, you'll be rich.)

573
00:19:31,250 --> 00:19:32,350
He'll be rich.

574
00:19:33,150 --> 00:19:34,749
- That's a good year then.
- Yes.

575
00:19:34,750 --> 00:19:36,949
- Right? It couldn't be better.
- It couldn't be better.

576
00:19:36,950 --> 00:19:38,019
Great.

577
00:19:38,020 --> 00:19:39,189
So that's how it goes.

578
00:19:39,190 --> 00:19:40,766
- I didn't see them coming at all.
- Right.

579
00:19:40,790 --> 00:19:42,590
Since when did you become our fan?

580
00:19:43,360 --> 00:19:45,430
- Since "DASH."
- Really?

581
00:19:45,530 --> 00:19:46,859
- I was studying for the CSAT.
- Do you need this chair?

582
00:19:46,860 --> 00:19:49,029
Were you born in 2005?

583
00:19:49,030 --> 00:19:51,930
- I was born in 2007.
- In 2007?

584
00:19:52,100 --> 00:19:53,239
- I...
- What?

585
00:19:53,240 --> 00:19:54,270
I'm 19 years old.

586
00:19:54,770 --> 00:19:56,210
You got into college at a young age.

587
00:19:56,400 --> 00:19:58,309
- He must be a real genius.
- He was born in 2007?

588
00:19:58,310 --> 00:19:59,539
(Shy)

589
00:19:59,540 --> 00:20:00,680
He's a real genius!

590
00:20:01,510 --> 00:20:03,039
- This is nothing at KAIST.
- He entered KAIST...

591
00:20:03,040 --> 00:20:04,209
- So many of us were born in 2007.
- at a young age.

592
00:20:04,210 --> 00:20:06,079
- Really?
- Only geniuses come here.

593
00:20:06,080 --> 00:20:07,149
Was it the second...

594
00:20:07,150 --> 00:20:08,679
- Yes. The 2nd year...
- or 3rd year of high school?

595
00:20:08,680 --> 00:20:09,719
I got here in my second year.

596
00:20:09,720 --> 00:20:11,066
(He entered KAIST after his 2nd year of high school.)

597
00:20:11,090 --> 00:20:13,289
(The first mission in Daejeon with a genius student)

598
00:20:13,290 --> 00:20:15,820
(Table Tennis Ball on the Run)

599
00:20:16,360 --> 00:20:17,489
Why is it tilted?

600
00:20:17,490 --> 00:20:18,529
(They must roll...)

601
00:20:18,530 --> 00:20:21,930
(a table tennis ball on the tilted table to get it into the bucket.)

602
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:23,329
(Round 1)

603
00:20:23,330 --> 00:20:26,430
(Get 2 table tennis balls into the bucket.)

604
00:20:26,700 --> 00:20:28,269
- Two?
- Two people out of four.

605
00:20:28,270 --> 00:20:29,299
(2 of the 4 people must succeed.)

606
00:20:29,300 --> 00:20:32,709
So we have to start from here.

607
00:20:32,710 --> 00:20:33,809
It should go up...

608
00:20:33,810 --> 00:20:34,810
- and then drop into the bucket.
- That's really hard.

609
00:20:34,811 --> 00:20:36,240
My gosh. This is way too hard.

610
00:20:38,480 --> 00:20:39,510
Thank you.

611
00:20:40,080 --> 00:20:41,800
- It looks doable.
- I think you can do it.

612
00:20:47,290 --> 00:20:48,989
(Jae Suk gets the hang of it right away.)

613
00:20:48,990 --> 00:20:50,950
- He's good during practice.
- Like that. Try it.

614
00:20:51,390 --> 00:20:52,950
I always mess up during the real games.

615
00:20:53,760 --> 00:20:54,860
- Yes.
- That was close.

616
00:20:55,360 --> 00:20:56,730
(We have a shot.)

617
00:20:56,870 --> 00:20:58,169
- Okay.
- Try it.

618
00:20:58,170 --> 00:20:59,370
- We have a shot.
- Okay.

619
00:21:00,240 --> 00:21:01,520
- Yes.
- She got a knack for it.

620
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:04,310
- Not okay.
- Here.

621
00:21:05,210 --> 00:21:06,210
You tossed it too hard.

622
00:21:07,010 --> 00:21:08,040
Throw it a little harder.

623
00:21:08,780 --> 00:21:09,780
They can average out...

624
00:21:09,781 --> 00:21:11,209
(They can average out...)

625
00:21:11,210 --> 00:21:14,149
I heard Myung Hyeon say this in the back.

626
00:21:14,150 --> 00:21:16,150
"They can average out their power."

627
00:21:16,820 --> 00:21:17,820
"Average?"

628
00:21:18,050 --> 00:21:19,289
- He's calculating it.
- You try it.

629
00:21:19,290 --> 00:21:20,659
My gosh. He's indeed a man of science.

630
00:21:20,660 --> 00:21:22,990
- What was that? Right.
- He's a man of science. Right?

631
00:21:23,460 --> 00:21:26,129
- Let's proceed with our first try.
- Let's try it.

632
00:21:26,130 --> 00:21:28,300
- Let's go.
- This is our try number one.

633
00:21:28,560 --> 00:21:29,560
Let's bring it in.

634
00:21:29,561 --> 00:21:30,769
- In 1, 2, 3.
- In 1, 2, 3.

635
00:21:30,770 --> 00:21:31,770
- Let's go.
- Let's go.

636
00:21:31,771 --> 00:21:33,399
- This is our 1st try.
- Our 1st try.

637
00:21:33,400 --> 00:21:34,439
(Out of 10 total tries, they're on try number 1.)

638
00:21:34,440 --> 00:21:36,100
- Let's get one each.
- Okay.

639
00:21:36,240 --> 00:21:37,669
(1st try, Yeon Seok)

640
00:21:37,670 --> 00:21:38,740
This is...

641
00:21:38,870 --> 00:21:40,939
- It feels like a new kind of game.
- Right.

642
00:21:40,940 --> 00:21:42,780
- How did they come up with this?
- Like that?

643
00:21:43,080 --> 00:21:44,310
It should go just like this.

644
00:21:48,780 --> 00:21:50,460
(It bounces out after hitting the bucket.)

645
00:21:51,350 --> 00:21:53,220
- That was so close.
- It was super close.

646
00:21:53,690 --> 00:21:54,959
- Nice try.
- Haewon.

647
00:21:54,960 --> 00:21:55,960
Haewon.

648
00:21:56,460 --> 00:21:57,490
- Haewon.
- Yes.

649
00:21:57,630 --> 00:21:58,660
- You can do this.
- Yes.

650
00:21:59,330 --> 00:22:00,460
I'm scared.

651
00:22:04,900 --> 00:22:05,900
That was too short.

652
00:22:05,901 --> 00:22:07,099
(1st try, SULLYOON)

653
00:22:07,100 --> 00:22:08,299
(The remaining two must succeed to complete the round.)

654
00:22:08,300 --> 00:22:09,600
You have to get it in.

655
00:22:12,740 --> 00:22:14,480
- My gosh.
- Oh, no.

656
00:22:14,980 --> 00:22:16,210
- I'm sorry.
- We failed then.

657
00:22:16,780 --> 00:22:18,579
- We failed our first try.
- Right. They did well.

658
00:22:18,580 --> 00:22:19,649
(Jae Suk doesn't even get to try.)

659
00:22:19,650 --> 00:22:21,319
- It's not easy.
- This is an elaborate game.

660
00:22:21,320 --> 00:22:22,379
Right.

661
00:22:22,380 --> 00:22:23,700
Let's play it at our orientation.

662
00:22:24,220 --> 00:22:26,219
- We could do it there.
- Isn't it the perfect game?

663
00:22:26,220 --> 00:22:27,690
- Yes.
- He skipped...

664
00:22:27,760 --> 00:22:30,730
orientation because he had to go to NMIXX concert.

665
00:22:32,230 --> 00:22:34,260
- Thank you.
- He's a real fan.

666
00:22:34,700 --> 00:22:37,399
(A concert by my idol group is more important than orientation.)

667
00:22:37,400 --> 00:22:38,569
It's 3 against 2.

668
00:22:38,570 --> 00:22:39,730
(NMIXX)

669
00:22:40,840 --> 00:22:42,569
- It's so touching.
- It really is.

670
00:22:42,570 --> 00:22:43,670
He skipped orientation.

671
00:22:43,940 --> 00:22:45,770
- Let's practice.
- Okay.

672
00:22:46,110 --> 00:22:47,809
- This is hard.
- Right.

673
00:22:47,810 --> 00:22:49,110
(Practicing)

674
00:22:50,780 --> 00:22:51,900
SULLYOON, did you get it in?

675
00:22:53,420 --> 00:22:54,850
They should've gone for it.

676
00:22:55,350 --> 00:22:58,650
- We should've gone for it.
- We should keep the momentum going.

677
00:22:59,090 --> 00:23:00,250
Do I have to do it like this?

678
00:23:00,460 --> 00:23:01,460
It doesn't matter.

679
00:23:02,320 --> 00:23:04,190
That's it. You must toss it gently like that.

680
00:23:04,830 --> 00:23:06,559
- That's it. Like that.
- My gosh.

681
00:23:06,560 --> 00:23:08,960
Right. It's going too much toward the x-axis.

682
00:23:09,030 --> 00:23:10,699
- The space...
- It should go up higher...

683
00:23:10,700 --> 00:23:12,406
- if they can.
- The x-axis and the y-axis.

684
00:23:12,430 --> 00:23:13,440
What?

685
00:23:14,370 --> 00:23:16,740
- It should go toward the y-axis.
- It's little bit...

686
00:23:16,840 --> 00:23:19,010
He told us to toss it toward the y-axis.

687
00:23:19,940 --> 00:23:21,880
Can you explain what the x-axis and y-axis are?

688
00:23:22,940 --> 00:23:25,109
- The horizontal line is the x-axis.
- The x-axis.

689
00:23:25,110 --> 00:23:27,096
- The vertical line is the y-axis.
- That's the y-axis.

690
00:23:27,120 --> 00:23:29,619
The bucket is over there, and the ball has to drop down.

691
00:23:29,620 --> 00:23:30,620
To make that happen,

692
00:23:30,621 --> 00:23:32,181
- there should be a parabola.
- Then...

693
00:23:32,590 --> 00:23:34,059
- So make it go higher?
- Toss it up.

694
00:23:34,060 --> 00:23:35,359
- It should be an upward trajectory.
- Like this?

695
00:23:35,360 --> 00:23:36,689
- Okay.
- I see.

696
00:23:36,690 --> 00:23:38,960
- Push it up along the y-axis?
- Yes.

697
00:23:39,230 --> 00:23:41,229
- The bucket is hanging like this.
- Toward the bucket.

698
00:23:41,230 --> 00:23:42,230
I see.

699
00:23:42,231 --> 00:23:43,311
(Push up along the y-axis?)

700
00:23:46,030 --> 00:23:47,040
He got it.

701
00:23:47,640 --> 00:23:50,709
- Now... Jae Suk.
- My gosh!

702
00:23:50,710 --> 00:23:52,769
(Their y-axis advice worked!)

703
00:23:52,770 --> 00:23:55,080
(Feeling proud)

704
00:23:55,310 --> 00:23:57,249
- Jae Suk. Yes!
- My gosh!

705
00:23:57,250 --> 00:23:59,279
- Let's go for it.
- We now have to...

706
00:23:59,280 --> 00:24:00,679
- We now have to get the path right.
- Let's do it.

707
00:24:00,680 --> 00:24:02,449
In 1, 2, 3.

708
00:24:02,450 --> 00:24:04,149
- Here we go.
- We have to get the path right now.

709
00:24:04,150 --> 00:24:06,110
(Out of 10 total tries, they're on try number 2.)

710
00:24:07,820 --> 00:24:08,900
I don't feel confident now.

711
00:24:09,490 --> 00:24:11,459
- You can't take a break now.
- Jae Suk. You have to do it.

712
00:24:11,460 --> 00:24:15,959
(2nd try, Jae Suk)

713
00:24:15,960 --> 00:24:17,100
A little more...

714
00:24:18,570 --> 00:24:19,930
He's not good during actual games.

715
00:24:20,170 --> 00:24:21,870
- It was close.
- SULLYOON.

716
00:24:22,440 --> 00:24:24,509
- Do what you did earlier.
- I don't think I can do it.

717
00:24:24,510 --> 00:24:25,540
Do what you did earlier.

718
00:24:27,010 --> 00:24:28,879
You got it!

719
00:24:28,880 --> 00:24:30,710
(You got it!)

720
00:24:32,180 --> 00:24:33,920
- You got it!
- Darn!

721
00:24:35,350 --> 00:24:36,849
- You got it!
- Darn!

722
00:24:36,850 --> 00:24:38,290
(It hits the edge and bounces out.)

723
00:24:38,750 --> 00:24:39,949
It could've gone in.

724
00:24:39,950 --> 00:24:42,890
(The remaining two must succeed to complete the round.)

725
00:24:43,260 --> 00:24:44,260
Go.

726
00:24:44,261 --> 00:24:46,859
(2nd try, Yeon Seok)

727
00:24:46,860 --> 00:24:48,430
Gosh!

728
00:24:48,930 --> 00:24:50,570
(It hits the edge and bounces out again.)

729
00:24:51,630 --> 00:24:54,440
(They fail their second try.)

730
00:24:55,840 --> 00:24:56,870
That was so close.

731
00:24:57,110 --> 00:24:58,310
What are we doing?

732
00:24:58,510 --> 00:24:59,510
A moment of silence.

733
00:25:01,280 --> 00:25:03,240
- Gosh, we can't succeed Round One.
- You failed.

734
00:25:04,810 --> 00:25:05,849
(Feeling not so confident, he starts practicing again.)

735
00:25:05,850 --> 00:25:06,850
My gosh.

736
00:25:07,750 --> 00:25:08,920
It went in earlier.

737
00:25:09,450 --> 00:25:11,220
- My gosh.
- That's the angle.

738
00:25:11,420 --> 00:25:14,360
- We must adjust our strength too.
- Right. We need to do that too.

739
00:25:16,690 --> 00:25:19,060
Jae Suk is really good when he's practicing.

740
00:25:20,200 --> 00:25:21,730
- Should we try now?
- Oh, my.

741
00:25:23,230 --> 00:25:24,230
- None.
- I see.

742
00:25:25,200 --> 00:25:27,239
We should try to practice some more.

743
00:25:27,240 --> 00:25:29,440
Hold on. I figured it out.

744
00:25:29,870 --> 00:25:31,609
- Aim for this dot.
- That's the sweet spot?

745
00:25:31,610 --> 00:25:32,639
Aim for this dot.

746
00:25:32,640 --> 00:25:34,640
(That's the sweet spot?)

747
00:25:35,040 --> 00:25:36,040
(Jae Suk's spot)

748
00:25:36,041 --> 00:25:38,480
(She uses Jae Suk's spot to zero in on her aim.)

749
00:25:38,910 --> 00:25:39,950
- Look.
- My gosh.

750
00:25:40,050 --> 00:25:42,020
- Yes, Haewon. Look at the spot.
- Okay.

751
00:25:43,120 --> 00:25:45,119
- Okay. That was too much.
- Yes, it was too much.

752
00:25:45,120 --> 00:25:46,750
That was too much power.

753
00:25:46,790 --> 00:25:49,159
- That's it. You got it.
- My gosh.

754
00:25:49,160 --> 00:25:50,359
- Where is it?
- We got this.

755
00:25:50,360 --> 00:25:51,960
- That's the spot.
- That's the spot.

756
00:25:52,060 --> 00:25:53,060
- That's it.
- I'm cold.

757
00:25:56,900 --> 00:25:58,599
- That's the spot.
- That's the sweet spot.

758
00:25:58,600 --> 00:26:00,299
- Make sure it passes the spot.
- Should we go for it?

759
00:26:00,300 --> 00:26:02,139
- If we fail, we'll use the coupon.
- We'll use the coupon then.

760
00:26:02,140 --> 00:26:03,269
In 1, 2, 3.

761
00:26:03,270 --> 00:26:04,509
- Here we go.
- Here we go.

762
00:26:04,510 --> 00:26:05,569
(Out of 10 total tries, they're on try number 3.)

763
00:26:05,570 --> 00:26:06,739
That's the spot.

764
00:26:06,740 --> 00:26:08,209
(3rd try, Jae Suk)

765
00:26:08,210 --> 00:26:09,970
That wasn't my position. I did it like this.

766
00:26:13,280 --> 00:26:14,600
Darn it. That was too much power.

767
00:26:14,980 --> 00:26:16,050
But you...

768
00:26:16,550 --> 00:26:17,920
Darn it. That was too much power.

769
00:26:18,250 --> 00:26:19,819
- But you...
- Let's consider it bad luck.

770
00:26:19,820 --> 00:26:20,820
(You had your aim set.)

771
00:26:21,060 --> 00:26:22,359
- SULLYOON.
- But you...

772
00:26:22,360 --> 00:26:23,559
(3rd try, SULLYOON)

773
00:26:23,560 --> 00:26:24,630
- Good luck.
- SULLYOON...

774
00:26:24,990 --> 00:26:26,160
- Good luck.
- SULLYOON...

775
00:26:26,330 --> 00:26:27,410
- She got it!
- She got it!

776
00:26:29,230 --> 00:26:30,400
- She got it!
- My gosh.

777
00:26:31,030 --> 00:26:32,669
(She precisely aims at Jae Suk's spot.)

778
00:26:32,670 --> 00:26:33,940
Only one of us has to succeed.

779
00:26:34,440 --> 00:26:35,800
We got this.

780
00:26:36,670 --> 00:26:39,409
- I believe in them.
- I do too.

781
00:26:39,410 --> 00:26:41,079
- All right.
- Just aim for that spot.

782
00:26:41,080 --> 00:26:42,840
- Right? That's the spot.
- That's the spot.

783
00:26:42,980 --> 00:26:44,680
- That's the spot.
- We believe in you.

784
00:26:45,050 --> 00:26:46,479
We believe in you.

785
00:26:46,480 --> 00:26:47,856
(SULLYOON succeeded by using Jae Suk's spot.)

786
00:26:47,880 --> 00:26:49,679
- Just like that.
- I don't need to overthink it.

787
00:26:49,680 --> 00:26:50,890
Just aim at that.

788
00:26:54,060 --> 00:26:55,060
You got it.

789
00:26:57,490 --> 00:26:59,960
(He got it?)

790
00:27:03,700 --> 00:27:04,870
You got it.

791
00:27:07,370 --> 00:27:10,810
(Jae Suk's spot)

792
00:27:11,510 --> 00:27:14,640
(Yeon Seok did it!)

793
00:27:16,110 --> 00:27:20,850
(Yoo One Shot finishes the game, living up to his nickname.)

794
00:27:26,890 --> 00:27:29,619
(Thanks to Jae Suk's spot, )

795
00:27:29,620 --> 00:27:31,089
(they cleared Round 1.)

796
00:27:31,090 --> 00:27:33,530
- All right. We completed Round 1.
- We completed Round 1.

797
00:27:34,560 --> 00:27:36,360
- I can't believe we did it.
- That was hard.

798
00:27:36,730 --> 00:27:37,770
- My gosh.
- Oh, my.

799
00:27:38,600 --> 00:27:41,739
All right. You won the microphone set for now.

800
00:27:41,740 --> 00:27:43,940
But Round Two...

801
00:27:44,110 --> 00:27:47,609
Round Two will be harder.

802
00:27:47,610 --> 00:27:49,279
But the quality of the prize will get better.

803
00:27:49,280 --> 00:27:50,949
Think carefully whether or not...

804
00:27:50,950 --> 00:27:52,649
- you'll keep going or stop.
- You must make a decision.

805
00:27:52,650 --> 00:27:53,850
One, two, three.

806
00:27:53,880 --> 00:27:55,220
Go.

807
00:27:56,950 --> 00:27:58,449
- It's impossible not to keep going.
- My gosh.

808
00:27:58,450 --> 00:28:00,050
- Right.
- It's too soon to stop.

809
00:28:00,120 --> 00:28:02,619
"I want the perfect furniture to keep my back and neck healthy..."

810
00:28:02,620 --> 00:28:04,289
"while I work through the night editing."

811
00:28:04,290 --> 00:28:06,129
A standing desk and a chair.

812
00:28:06,130 --> 00:28:08,599
(Round 2 prize: A standing desk and a chair)

813
00:28:08,600 --> 00:28:10,100
- That's nice.
- That's a nice chair.

814
00:28:10,970 --> 00:28:12,130
- It's...
- Oh, my.

815
00:28:12,230 --> 00:28:13,330
Do you guys need them?

816
00:28:13,430 --> 00:28:16,339
- We're working with a poor setup.
- Yes. We...

817
00:28:16,340 --> 00:28:17,969
- Where's the chair?
- It'd be great to replace that.

818
00:28:17,970 --> 00:28:19,570
- That's a poor setup.
- Right.

819
00:28:19,770 --> 00:28:21,939
- It's a height adjustable desk.
- That's right.

820
00:28:21,940 --> 00:28:23,109
(A standing desk and a chair to improve their work setup)

821
00:28:23,110 --> 00:28:24,749
(Round 2)

822
00:28:24,750 --> 00:28:27,580
(There will be a barrier in the middle.)

823
00:28:27,920 --> 00:28:29,079
- A barrier?
- What?

824
00:28:29,080 --> 00:28:30,589
(A barrier?)

825
00:28:30,590 --> 00:28:31,920
- Come on.
- No.

826
00:28:33,020 --> 00:28:34,536
It's okay as long as the spot isn't covered.

827
00:28:34,560 --> 00:28:36,760
- Gosh. What is this?
- Wait. This is way too high.

828
00:28:38,130 --> 00:28:39,589
Then the ball will have to go higher.

829
00:28:39,590 --> 00:28:40,799
But the trajectory...

830
00:28:40,800 --> 00:28:41,920
- Gosh. This is...
- Oh, no.

831
00:28:42,460 --> 00:28:44,769
(Jae Suk's spot helped them clear Round 1.)

832
00:28:44,770 --> 00:28:46,099
- Wait. This...
- You can't cover up the spot.

833
00:28:46,100 --> 00:28:47,270
How will we play then?

834
00:28:47,640 --> 00:28:48,700
My gosh. This...

835
00:28:49,270 --> 00:28:51,270
- The angle has to be higher.
- It has to be high.

836
00:28:51,440 --> 00:28:52,710
Is it even possible?

837
00:28:53,910 --> 00:28:55,910
How do people come up with such a game?

838
00:28:59,510 --> 00:29:00,749
- What?
- My gosh.

839
00:29:00,750 --> 00:29:02,449
Why do I always succeed during practice?

840
00:29:02,450 --> 00:29:04,189
- Jae Suk.
- Gosh.

841
00:29:04,190 --> 00:29:05,449
- The Practice World Messi.
- You are so good at it.

842
00:29:05,450 --> 00:29:07,319
- I'm Messi during practice.
- Cool.

843
00:29:07,320 --> 00:29:08,389
Just now,

844
00:29:08,390 --> 00:29:09,559
- you passed this point, right?
- Yes.

845
00:29:09,560 --> 00:29:11,359
- Different in strength control.
- Correct.

846
00:29:11,360 --> 00:29:13,430
You found a different curve.

847
00:29:14,200 --> 00:29:15,930
- Nice one.
- Wait, Haewon.

848
00:29:16,130 --> 00:29:17,169
- Where was it?
- Here.

849
00:29:17,170 --> 00:29:18,999
- Around here?
- We can see the hope.

850
00:29:19,000 --> 00:29:20,229
- Around here.
- That's right.

851
00:29:20,230 --> 00:29:22,770
- Your favorite will protect you.
- Let's succeed Round Two.

852
00:29:25,310 --> 00:29:26,510
- Oh, my.
- Yes.

853
00:29:26,610 --> 00:29:28,309
- You can do it right away.
- I've got it.

854
00:29:28,310 --> 00:29:29,339
- I've got the hang of it.
- Let's try.

855
00:29:29,340 --> 00:29:30,809
- You can do it right away.
- Let's try.

856
00:29:30,810 --> 00:29:31,849
- Let's try.
- Let's try.

857
00:29:31,850 --> 00:29:33,649
- All right. Round 2. In 1, 2, 3.
- In 1...

858
00:29:33,650 --> 00:29:34,919
- Here we go!
- Here we go! Do it, Yeon Seok.

859
00:29:34,920 --> 00:29:35,920
(Trying Round 2 bravely)

860
00:29:36,180 --> 00:29:38,919
(However...)

861
00:29:38,920 --> 00:29:40,249
(Out of 10 total tries, they're on try number 4.)

862
00:29:40,250 --> 00:29:41,720
- You did it.
- It's going in.

863
00:29:42,720 --> 00:29:44,059
(Failed the 4th try)

864
00:29:44,060 --> 00:29:45,190
That was a good curve.

865
00:29:45,230 --> 00:29:46,230
It's going in.

866
00:29:46,231 --> 00:29:47,429
(5th try)

867
00:29:47,430 --> 00:29:48,529
(Failed)

868
00:29:48,530 --> 00:29:50,230
- Hold on. It's going in.
- It's going in.

869
00:29:50,670 --> 00:29:51,670
(Failed)

870
00:29:51,671 --> 00:29:52,829
That was close.

871
00:29:52,830 --> 00:29:53,869
(Smile Fairy is no longer smiling.)

872
00:29:53,870 --> 00:29:54,970
Let's use the coupon.

873
00:29:55,000 --> 00:29:56,900
(Bonus coupon try)

874
00:29:58,140 --> 00:29:59,140
What a bummer.

875
00:30:00,310 --> 00:30:01,479
(Continuing to practice)

876
00:30:01,480 --> 00:30:02,709
- This one's tough.
- For real.

877
00:30:02,710 --> 00:30:03,880
Try it, Haewon.

878
00:30:04,150 --> 00:30:05,479
We need to put two balls in it.

879
00:30:05,480 --> 00:30:07,950
- Let's get some in.
- It won't go in.

880
00:30:08,750 --> 00:30:10,250
No regrets. We had fun, right?

881
00:30:11,450 --> 00:30:12,690
- It was fun.
- Don't give up.

882
00:30:14,060 --> 00:30:15,219
- It's going in.
- You did it.

883
00:30:15,220 --> 00:30:16,260
(Failed the 7th try)

884
00:30:16,490 --> 00:30:19,189
(8th try)

885
00:30:19,190 --> 00:30:20,899
(9th try)

886
00:30:20,900 --> 00:30:23,600
(Failed)

887
00:30:24,200 --> 00:30:27,340
(In the end, the last try has come.)

888
00:30:28,140 --> 00:30:29,299
Dramas are supposed to be...

889
00:30:29,300 --> 00:30:30,440
- dramatic.
- Exactly.

890
00:30:30,540 --> 00:30:33,470
There's always a climax.

891
00:30:35,340 --> 00:30:36,480
Is it the last try?

892
00:30:36,540 --> 00:30:37,909
This is just too difficult.

893
00:30:37,910 --> 00:30:38,949
It's really challenging.

894
00:30:38,950 --> 00:30:40,280
I need more practice.

895
00:30:40,820 --> 00:30:41,920
Is it the last try?

896
00:30:43,120 --> 00:30:44,649
- That's it.
- She did it.

897
00:30:44,650 --> 00:30:45,789
- That's it.
- She did it.

898
00:30:45,790 --> 00:30:46,889
- She's got a feel for it.
- What?

899
00:30:46,890 --> 00:30:47,959
- For real.
- She got it.

900
00:30:47,960 --> 00:30:49,090
It went in suddenly.

901
00:30:49,390 --> 00:30:50,690
- Gosh, Haewon.
- Gosh.

902
00:30:50,830 --> 00:30:52,559
- You've got the hang of it.
- Oh, my.

903
00:30:52,560 --> 00:30:54,360
You should start us off.

904
00:30:54,700 --> 00:30:56,129
- Start us off.
- I've got it.

905
00:30:56,130 --> 00:30:57,699
- Let's try. The last try.
- Let's try.

906
00:30:57,700 --> 00:30:59,229
- Let's go, okay?
- In 1, 2, 3.

907
00:30:59,230 --> 00:31:00,300
- Let's go!
- Let's go!

908
00:31:00,370 --> 00:31:01,399
Haewon goes first.

909
00:31:01,400 --> 00:31:02,499
(Out of 10 total tries, they're on the last try.)

910
00:31:02,500 --> 00:31:03,670
Do it when you've got it.

911
00:31:05,710 --> 00:31:06,840
Do it when you've got it.

912
00:31:09,110 --> 00:31:10,409
- As long as I don't make a mistake.
- Well done.

913
00:31:10,410 --> 00:31:12,156
- It's okay.
- We should've tried right away.

914
00:31:12,180 --> 00:31:13,280
I'm sorry.

915
00:31:13,610 --> 00:31:15,579
- It was fun.
- Have faith in them until the end.

916
00:31:15,580 --> 00:31:18,150
- They'll succeed.
- Trust them.

917
00:31:18,650 --> 00:31:19,819
After SULLYOON.

918
00:31:19,820 --> 00:31:22,090
(Last try, SULLYOON)

919
00:31:27,330 --> 00:31:29,330
(A goal!)

920
00:31:30,360 --> 00:31:31,429
(SULLYOON has done it again.)

921
00:31:31,430 --> 00:31:33,570
- Nice. I have a good feeling today.
- You did it.

922
00:31:34,470 --> 00:31:35,570
No, what?

923
00:31:35,770 --> 00:31:37,530
- I have a good feeling today.
- You did it.

924
00:31:38,170 --> 00:31:39,339
Should I try?

925
00:31:39,340 --> 00:31:41,309
- Do it. You've got it, right?
- Okay.

926
00:31:41,310 --> 00:31:42,340
- Here I go.
- Okay.

927
00:31:43,310 --> 00:31:45,580
(Please succeed.)

928
00:31:52,220 --> 00:31:53,650
(Jae Suk failed.)

929
00:31:55,360 --> 00:31:56,560
How did it...

930
00:31:56,990 --> 00:31:58,090
Yeon Shik.

931
00:31:58,760 --> 00:32:00,359
- I'm sorry.
- Yoo Yeon Seok!

932
00:32:00,360 --> 00:32:02,160
- Okay, Yeon Seok.
- Yoo Yeon Seok!

933
00:32:02,300 --> 00:32:04,929
- Yoo Yeon Seok!
- Let's go!

934
00:32:04,930 --> 00:32:06,170
Succeed at what I've failed.

935
00:32:11,908 --> 00:32:14,808
(Go in.)

936
00:32:18,078 --> 00:32:19,078
It didn't go in for real.

937
00:32:19,848 --> 00:32:21,848
(The end)

938
00:32:24,918 --> 00:32:25,918
It didn't go in for real.

939
00:32:25,919 --> 00:32:27,258
- We're screwed.
- Oh, no.

940
00:32:27,418 --> 00:32:28,787
I thought it'd go in.

941
00:32:28,788 --> 00:32:29,788
Failed.

942
00:32:35,328 --> 00:32:39,738
(Thought they'd succeed for sure)

943
00:32:40,698 --> 00:32:42,138
We were on a roll during practice.

944
00:32:42,368 --> 00:32:43,667
- What a bummer.
- The big one...

945
00:32:43,668 --> 00:32:44,768
Oh, dear.

946
00:32:45,808 --> 00:32:47,607
(Taking the prize out)

947
00:32:47,608 --> 00:32:48,678
The microphone.

948
00:32:49,048 --> 00:32:50,078
The microphone.

949
00:32:52,418 --> 00:32:54,047
- Well...
- One microphone...

950
00:32:54,048 --> 00:32:55,118
is enough.

951
00:32:55,478 --> 00:32:57,618
- We had fun.
- Yes, it was fun.

952
00:32:59,358 --> 00:33:01,088
To think we'd fail again in Daejeon.

953
00:33:01,488 --> 00:33:04,128
We're bad at playing games in Daejeon.

954
00:33:04,858 --> 00:33:07,597
They say movies must be shot with a low budget.

955
00:33:07,598 --> 00:33:09,568
We're sorry, Myung Hyeon and Ju Hyun.

956
00:33:09,668 --> 00:33:11,428
If only I had...

957
00:33:12,238 --> 00:33:13,438
It's a shame.

958
00:33:13,668 --> 00:33:16,068
- Wouldn't it be nice if you two...
- Yes?

959
00:33:16,138 --> 00:33:18,977
Could say a word to NSWER, Myung Hyeon?

960
00:33:18,978 --> 00:33:20,077
- Nice idea.
- A New Year's blessing.

961
00:33:20,078 --> 00:33:21,538
- Yes.
- Great.

962
00:33:21,908 --> 00:33:23,377
This gift might be more meaningful.

963
00:33:23,378 --> 00:33:25,448
- Please do it, Haewon and SULLYOON.
- Please.

964
00:33:25,548 --> 00:33:27,818
I heard you became of age this year.

965
00:33:28,318 --> 00:33:29,347
Always stay healthy,

966
00:33:29,348 --> 00:33:31,547
and I'll be waiting for you at our concert.

967
00:33:31,548 --> 00:33:32,587
(Always stay healthy, )

968
00:33:32,588 --> 00:33:34,818
(and I'll be waiting for you at our concert.)

969
00:33:35,828 --> 00:33:39,198
(This is what you call a successful fan!)

970
00:33:41,428 --> 00:33:43,267
- She's no joke.
- Hold on.

971
00:33:43,268 --> 00:33:45,768
- You're no joke, Haewon.
- Goodness.

972
00:33:46,038 --> 00:33:47,197
- Haewon.
- Wait.

973
00:33:47,198 --> 00:33:48,198
"I'll be waiting..."

974
00:33:48,199 --> 00:33:49,384
- "for you at our concert."
- Give me a second.

975
00:33:49,408 --> 00:33:51,268
- Gosh.
- He can't shoot any movies.

976
00:33:51,738 --> 00:33:53,437
- Look at his face.
- Right now, it's...

977
00:33:53,438 --> 00:33:54,638
He's beet red.

978
00:33:54,708 --> 00:33:56,607
I'm so glad I got the chance...

979
00:33:56,608 --> 00:34:00,148
to be on the show with the two I befriended in the club.

980
00:34:00,178 --> 00:34:03,748
And what's more, my favorite NMIXX was the guest.

981
00:34:03,988 --> 00:34:05,488
I was on cloud nine.

982
00:34:05,548 --> 00:34:06,758
Thank you for coming.

983
00:34:07,088 --> 00:34:08,117
Whenever possible.

984
00:34:08,118 --> 00:34:10,958
- Let's graduate from being single.
- Let's graduate from being single.

985
00:34:11,888 --> 00:34:13,228
What a disappointment.

986
00:34:13,998 --> 00:34:16,027
- What a bummer.
- I was at fault.

987
00:34:16,028 --> 00:34:17,327
- Again...
- SULLYOON was good at it.

988
00:34:17,328 --> 00:34:18,698
We were so close.

989
00:34:18,928 --> 00:34:20,097
In Daejeon...

990
00:34:20,098 --> 00:34:21,337
(At this rate, it's a Daejeon jinx.)

991
00:34:21,338 --> 00:34:22,367
We have two more places to go.

992
00:34:22,368 --> 00:34:23,368
- Right.
- Yes.

993
00:34:23,369 --> 00:34:25,538
Fail again, and...

994
00:34:25,568 --> 00:34:27,107
- We can't come back.
- We totally can't.

995
00:34:27,108 --> 00:34:28,708
- We can't come to Daejeon.
- For real.

996
00:34:28,938 --> 00:34:29,978
Where's the next place?

997
00:34:30,808 --> 00:34:32,978
Jeong Mi Sun and Kim Yu Han.

998
00:34:33,418 --> 00:34:35,618
"Between numbers and rock layers..."

999
00:34:36,018 --> 00:34:37,018
Rock layers?

1000
00:34:37,218 --> 00:34:39,388
- Rock layers?
- Rock layers?

1001
00:34:39,458 --> 00:34:43,258
"We're partners studying the invisible energy."

1002
00:34:43,628 --> 00:34:45,757
"We spend most of our day sitting in front of a monitor,"

1003
00:34:45,758 --> 00:34:47,697
"holding out with a sense of duty..."

1004
00:34:47,698 --> 00:34:49,127
"because someone has to do this work."

1005
00:34:49,128 --> 00:34:50,227
They must be researchers.

1006
00:34:50,228 --> 00:34:52,197
- It seems like it.
- Right?

1007
00:34:52,198 --> 00:34:54,168
If it's 12:20pm, we should leave now, right?

1008
00:34:54,498 --> 00:34:55,707
Yes, right now.

1009
00:34:55,708 --> 00:34:56,808
- Right?
- Yes.

1010
00:34:57,168 --> 00:34:58,168
- Let's go.
- The road...

1011
00:34:58,169 --> 00:35:00,137
(Heading to the second spare time)

1012
00:35:00,138 --> 00:35:01,677
Wait. "Korea Radioactive..."

1013
00:35:01,678 --> 00:35:04,148
- Waste Agency?"
- "Korea Radioactive Waste Agency?"

1014
00:35:04,678 --> 00:35:05,947
Numbers and rock layers.

1015
00:35:05,948 --> 00:35:07,378
(Today's second spare time)

1016
00:35:07,818 --> 00:35:10,547
- Let's hurry.
- We don't have much time left.

1017
00:35:10,548 --> 00:35:12,047
Radioactive researchers?

1018
00:35:12,048 --> 00:35:13,217
Mi Sun and...

1019
00:35:13,218 --> 00:35:14,958
- Yu Han.
- Yu Han.

1020
00:35:15,318 --> 00:35:17,327
- Hi.
- Hi.

1021
00:35:17,328 --> 00:35:18,587
Are you Mi Sun and Yu Han?

1022
00:35:18,588 --> 00:35:20,257
- Yes.
- Hi.

1023
00:35:20,258 --> 00:35:21,627
- Nice to meet you.
- Hi.

1024
00:35:21,628 --> 00:35:23,397
- Hi.
- Nice to meet you.

1025
00:35:23,398 --> 00:35:24,498
- Nice to meet you.
- Hi.

1026
00:35:24,568 --> 00:35:25,568
(Kim Yu Han and Jeong Mi Sun, )

1027
00:35:25,569 --> 00:35:27,798
(the second spare time Whenever Guests)

1028
00:35:27,968 --> 00:35:29,537
Please sit in the center.

1029
00:35:29,538 --> 00:35:31,037
Shall I sit here?

1030
00:35:31,038 --> 00:35:32,538
- Yes.
- Okay.

1031
00:35:33,138 --> 00:35:35,407
I'm sitting in the top seat.

1032
00:35:35,408 --> 00:35:37,147
(Taking the top seat with a prime minister–style hat)

1033
00:35:37,148 --> 00:35:38,748
Well, I don't mind.

1034
00:35:39,618 --> 00:35:43,787
It looked like this place had something to do with nuclear energy.

1035
00:35:43,788 --> 00:35:45,548
Yes, you're correct.

1036
00:35:45,958 --> 00:35:48,918
How long have you two been working here?

1037
00:35:49,058 --> 00:35:50,827
It's been 15 years.

1038
00:35:50,828 --> 00:35:51,927
- Fifteen?
- Gosh.

1039
00:35:51,928 --> 00:35:52,957
- Fifteen.
- And you?

1040
00:35:52,958 --> 00:35:54,358
I'm in my fourth year.

1041
00:35:54,928 --> 00:35:57,167
- Mi Sun is his senior.
- That's right.

1042
00:35:57,168 --> 00:36:00,967
What made you send a letter to us?

1043
00:36:00,968 --> 00:36:02,267
I'm the one who sent it.

1044
00:36:02,268 --> 00:36:03,468
- You did?
- Yes.

1045
00:36:03,708 --> 00:36:05,108
We were crazy busy.

1046
00:36:05,538 --> 00:36:07,737
After coming this far without a break,

1047
00:36:07,738 --> 00:36:11,207
and making a record at the end of last year,

1048
00:36:11,208 --> 00:36:12,678
we finally got a little spare time.

1049
00:36:13,048 --> 00:36:14,377
That's why I sent the letter.

1050
00:36:14,378 --> 00:36:16,258
I wanted to spend that priceless time with her.

1051
00:36:17,088 --> 00:36:20,317
In a way, if you put it in terms of farming,

1052
00:36:20,318 --> 00:36:21,987
- it's the agricultural off-season.
- Correct.

1053
00:36:21,988 --> 00:36:23,257
- You're done harvesting.
- Yes.

1054
00:36:23,258 --> 00:36:24,258
- That's right.
- I see.

1055
00:36:24,259 --> 00:36:25,797
In short, you wanted to enjoy...

1056
00:36:25,798 --> 00:36:27,827
- the spare time after producing...
- Yes.

1057
00:36:27,828 --> 00:36:29,168
- a result.
- Exactly.

1058
00:36:29,828 --> 00:36:30,927
(Done with our research!)

1059
00:36:30,928 --> 00:36:33,568
- This is our happiest moment.
- Right now?

1060
00:36:33,638 --> 00:36:34,667
This very moment?

1061
00:36:34,668 --> 00:36:37,808
You two seem the brightest right now.

1062
00:36:38,538 --> 00:36:40,077
- Correct.
- You look at peace.

1063
00:36:40,078 --> 00:36:43,207
Can you tell us in detail what task you're in charge of?

1064
00:36:43,208 --> 00:36:47,078
Do you know how electricity is produced?

1065
00:36:47,548 --> 00:36:49,887
There's the nuclear power plant, thermal power plant,

1066
00:36:49,888 --> 00:36:51,947
hydroelectric power plant, solar power, and more.

1067
00:36:51,948 --> 00:36:53,117
- Correct.
- Nice.

1068
00:36:53,118 --> 00:36:55,757
Among them, nuclear power plants...

1069
00:36:55,758 --> 00:36:57,857
- don't produce carbon.
- Right.

1070
00:36:57,858 --> 00:37:01,157
They're in charge of around 30 percent of our energy.

1071
00:37:01,158 --> 00:37:02,627
- Yes.
- That's quite a large...

1072
00:37:02,628 --> 00:37:03,697
- portion.
- Yes.

1073
00:37:03,698 --> 00:37:05,767
Despite that, nuclear power plants...

1074
00:37:05,768 --> 00:37:07,437
do produce trash.

1075
00:37:07,438 --> 00:37:08,697
- Waste.
- Waste.

1076
00:37:08,698 --> 00:37:09,737
That's right.

1077
00:37:09,738 --> 00:37:12,708
Radioactive waste is classified into different types.

1078
00:37:12,738 --> 00:37:14,307
There are low and intermediate-level, and high-level wastes.

1079
00:37:14,308 --> 00:37:16,077
- I know.
- Among them,

1080
00:37:16,078 --> 00:37:19,447
we study the high-level waste.

1081
00:37:19,448 --> 00:37:21,877
In short, this place is in charge of...

1082
00:37:21,878 --> 00:37:23,018
- high-level waste.
- Yes.

1083
00:37:23,288 --> 00:37:25,547
From what I know, that waste has to be stored for a long time,

1084
00:37:25,548 --> 00:37:26,687
like 100,000 years.

1085
00:37:26,688 --> 00:37:28,017
It has to be stored for 100,000 years...

1086
00:37:28,018 --> 00:37:30,758
to even 1,000,000 years.

1087
00:37:30,888 --> 00:37:34,097
The high-level waste storage...

1088
00:37:34,098 --> 00:37:38,427
will soon become saturated.

1089
00:37:38,428 --> 00:37:41,537
I'm not sure if you saw it on your way here.

1090
00:37:41,538 --> 00:37:44,138
The waste is stored in copper containers...

1091
00:37:44,408 --> 00:37:46,008
- and buried...
- Buried, right?

1092
00:37:46,138 --> 00:37:48,937
500m deep underground.

1093
00:37:48,938 --> 00:37:50,607
(Creating tunnels and disposal spaces...)

1094
00:37:50,608 --> 00:37:52,248
(in solid rock 500m underground)

1095
00:37:52,748 --> 00:37:55,317
We're currently researching...

1096
00:37:55,318 --> 00:37:57,518
how to bury the containers safely.

1097
00:37:57,818 --> 00:38:00,287
You're not building the storage,

1098
00:38:00,288 --> 00:38:02,587
but studying the process of it, right?

1099
00:38:02,588 --> 00:38:03,688
- Yes.
- Exactly.

1100
00:38:03,988 --> 00:38:06,457
So as not to shift the burden to future generations,

1101
00:38:06,458 --> 00:38:10,268
it's a problem all generations must solve together.

1102
00:38:10,368 --> 00:38:11,568
- You're right.
- Yes.

1103
00:38:12,128 --> 00:38:14,638
- Right.
- We failed...

1104
00:38:14,938 --> 00:38:16,708
our earlier mission.

1105
00:38:17,468 --> 00:38:19,237
- This is bad.
- Succeeding was...

1106
00:38:19,238 --> 00:38:22,438
- Our winning rate in Daejeon is 0.
- Yes, 0.

1107
00:38:23,248 --> 00:38:25,177
- Oh, no.
- Let's work hard...

1108
00:38:25,178 --> 00:38:27,078
- to succeed this time.
- Yes.

1109
00:38:27,518 --> 00:38:28,848
- Go ahead, Haewon.
- Okay.

1110
00:38:29,178 --> 00:38:30,187
- Here.
- I'll roll it.

1111
00:38:30,188 --> 00:38:31,548
- Good luck.
- Okay, good luck.

1112
00:38:37,488 --> 00:38:38,488
- One.
- One.

1113
00:38:38,489 --> 00:38:40,127
- Nice.
- At least it's not zero.

1114
00:38:40,128 --> 00:38:41,857
- It's not zero.
- One is enough.

1115
00:38:41,858 --> 00:38:43,097
- True.
- One is good.

1116
00:38:43,098 --> 00:38:44,458
- Thank goodness.
- One is enough.

1117
00:38:44,668 --> 00:38:46,097
- All right.
- What's the game?

1118
00:38:46,098 --> 00:38:47,778
Let's check out the Round One prize first.

1119
00:38:48,668 --> 00:38:51,268
"During long-distance commuting and long-distance relationships,"

1120
00:38:51,408 --> 00:38:52,877
"the gas station is the most visited place."

1121
00:38:52,878 --> 00:38:54,437
"Four-hundred-dollar gas voucher."

1122
00:38:54,438 --> 00:38:56,048
(Round 1 prize: 400 dollar gas voucher)

1123
00:38:56,148 --> 00:38:58,207
(The mission with the gas voucher as the prize)

1124
00:38:58,208 --> 00:39:00,177
(Circular Energy)

1125
00:39:00,178 --> 00:39:01,517
(Round 1)

1126
00:39:01,518 --> 00:39:02,917
(While avoiding the 2 beaded magnets, )

1127
00:39:02,918 --> 00:39:07,358
(place 4 magnets to succeed.)

1128
00:39:08,288 --> 00:39:09,487
- In the circle?
- Yes.

1129
00:39:09,488 --> 00:39:10,928
- This circle?
- Like this?

1130
00:39:11,088 --> 00:39:13,097
(All magnets must avoid each other.)

1131
00:39:13,098 --> 00:39:14,758
- Place one right here.
- That's right.

1132
00:39:15,658 --> 00:39:16,768
And here...

1133
00:39:17,928 --> 00:39:18,928
And here...

1134
00:39:18,929 --> 00:39:20,649
(Magnetic force is stronger than expected.)

1135
00:39:23,768 --> 00:39:25,007
(Attached)

1136
00:39:25,008 --> 00:39:26,737
- How scary.
- The magnetic force is strong.

1137
00:39:26,738 --> 00:39:28,507
- This one's hard.
- What a strong magnetic force.

1138
00:39:28,508 --> 00:39:29,578
Take one each.

1139
00:39:30,048 --> 00:39:31,947
(A rattlesnake magnet that pulls from afar)

1140
00:39:31,948 --> 00:39:33,948
(Zinging)

1141
00:39:34,418 --> 00:39:36,747
- What a challenge.
- It's called a rattlesnake magnet.

1142
00:39:36,748 --> 00:39:37,888
This is...

1143
00:39:38,388 --> 00:39:39,628
These two don't stick, do they?

1144
00:39:39,718 --> 00:39:41,478
- They do.
- So they do stick to each other.

1145
00:39:41,558 --> 00:39:42,627
This one's tough.

1146
00:39:42,628 --> 00:39:44,457
- As far apart as possible.
- You're right.

1147
00:39:44,458 --> 00:39:46,898
Let's see how close it can get before sticking to each other.

1148
00:39:47,658 --> 00:39:49,927
(Pushing)

1149
00:39:49,928 --> 00:39:50,998
The North...

1150
00:39:51,598 --> 00:39:52,997
- It has poles.
- Oh, my.

1151
00:39:52,998 --> 00:39:54,367
- It's being pulled in.
- I get it.

1152
00:39:54,368 --> 00:39:55,768
The magnet has poles.

1153
00:39:56,068 --> 00:39:58,208
- We need to identify the poles.
- I didn't know.

1154
00:39:58,638 --> 00:40:00,308
- None should stick.
- None should stick.

1155
00:40:00,808 --> 00:40:02,907
- It's difficult.
- Try it, Jae Suk. Place it down.

1156
00:40:02,908 --> 00:40:04,048
Me first.

1157
00:40:04,748 --> 00:40:05,947
- It won't stick from this distance.
- No.

1158
00:40:05,948 --> 00:40:07,508
(Placed in the center of the two beads)

1159
00:40:07,548 --> 00:40:08,778
(Haewon's turn)

1160
00:40:09,888 --> 00:40:11,448
We can't stack them up, can we?

1161
00:40:11,548 --> 00:40:13,557
The rule even includes our magnet, right?

1162
00:40:13,558 --> 00:40:15,238
- None can stick to each other.
- Correct.

1163
00:40:21,058 --> 00:40:23,667
(One rattlesnake turns fast.)

1164
00:40:23,668 --> 00:40:25,468
That was really scary.

1165
00:40:27,198 --> 00:40:28,837
Once you place it down, you can't touch it again.

1166
00:40:28,838 --> 00:40:29,838
(No second turns)

1167
00:40:30,338 --> 00:40:32,038
(She placed it down.)

1168
00:40:33,778 --> 00:40:35,508
(Moving)

1169
00:40:35,978 --> 00:40:37,608
Maybe around here.

1170
00:40:38,078 --> 00:40:39,178
Oh, no.

1171
00:40:39,948 --> 00:40:41,218
Stop!

1172
00:40:41,678 --> 00:40:43,218
Stop!

1173
00:40:43,788 --> 00:40:45,947
(A zinging horror)

1174
00:40:45,948 --> 00:40:47,017
What a strong force.

1175
00:40:47,018 --> 00:40:48,157
- For real.
- It's...

1176
00:40:48,158 --> 00:40:50,087
- Unbelievable.
- I can't place it down anywhere.

1177
00:40:50,088 --> 00:40:51,368
Why are these magnets so strong?

1178
00:40:52,058 --> 00:40:53,157
(Even new to the Whenever Guests)

1179
00:40:53,158 --> 00:40:54,227
- The last player...
- Does it...

1180
00:40:54,228 --> 00:40:55,857
- hurt?
- is the most critical.

1181
00:40:55,858 --> 00:40:57,267
(The fourth magnet must be placed carefully.)

1182
00:40:57,268 --> 00:40:58,597
Let's give it a shot.

1183
00:40:58,598 --> 00:40:59,767
(Trying it this time)

1184
00:40:59,768 --> 00:41:01,437
- Round 1?
- Round 1.

1185
00:41:01,438 --> 00:41:02,567
In 1, 2, 3.

1186
00:41:02,568 --> 00:41:03,707
- Here we go.
- Here we go.

1187
00:41:03,708 --> 00:41:05,537
(Out of 10 total tries, they're on try number 1.)

1188
00:41:05,538 --> 00:41:06,578
- Do I go first?
- Yes.

1189
00:41:06,778 --> 00:41:08,078
(Trembling)

1190
00:41:12,978 --> 00:41:14,147
(Moving slightly)

1191
00:41:14,148 --> 00:41:15,718
It's already moving a bit.

1192
00:41:16,118 --> 00:41:18,887
Good grief, it shouldn't be moving already.

1193
00:41:18,888 --> 00:41:19,888
(Passed with caution)

1194
00:41:19,888 --> 00:41:20,888
(Haewon's turn)

1195
00:41:20,889 --> 00:41:21,988
(1st try)

1196
00:41:23,558 --> 00:41:24,588
(Shaking)

1197
00:41:27,058 --> 00:41:28,358
(Don't wake it up.)

1198
00:41:28,458 --> 00:41:30,268
(Flinching)

1199
00:41:31,728 --> 00:41:34,298
(Dancing)

1200
00:41:35,938 --> 00:41:37,908
(Passed one way or another)

1201
00:41:39,408 --> 00:41:40,577
- We might succeed.
- Yes.

1202
00:41:40,578 --> 00:41:41,638
I...

1203
00:41:43,308 --> 00:41:46,077
Don't place it too close when the magnet is pulling.

1204
00:41:46,078 --> 00:41:47,548
- Gosh.
- You did it.

1205
00:41:48,218 --> 00:41:49,747
(Set it down boldly)

1206
00:41:49,748 --> 00:41:51,017
- We can make it.
- Five seconds.

1207
00:41:51,018 --> 00:41:52,958
(It's a pass if Yeon Seok succeeds.)

1208
00:41:55,658 --> 00:41:56,888
- We'll make it.
- Totally.

1209
00:41:58,328 --> 00:42:00,697
(Putting absolute pressure on him)

1210
00:42:00,698 --> 00:42:01,798
We'll totally make it.

1211
00:42:01,958 --> 00:42:03,358
The last player has it the hardest.

1212
00:42:03,598 --> 00:42:04,968
Since this one succeeded...

1213
00:42:05,728 --> 00:42:06,798
It'd be this one.

1214
00:42:08,038 --> 00:42:09,608
- I should've placed it here.
- No.

1215
00:42:09,768 --> 00:42:10,968
That bead is moving.

1216
00:42:12,938 --> 00:42:14,677
(They can succeed if the magnets stay still...)

1217
00:42:14,678 --> 00:42:16,407
(for 5 seconds after the last magnet is placed.)

1218
00:42:16,408 --> 00:42:18,608
(Scared)

1219
00:42:22,148 --> 00:42:23,218
We might succeed.

1220
00:42:24,118 --> 00:42:25,187
We did it.

1221
00:42:25,188 --> 00:42:26,618
- Five.
- Five, four,

1222
00:42:26,958 --> 00:42:29,158
three, two, one.

1223
00:42:29,288 --> 00:42:30,328
Success!

1224
00:42:31,528 --> 00:42:32,658
Success!

1225
00:42:33,598 --> 00:42:35,527
(The best placement found by overcoming their fear)

1226
00:42:35,528 --> 00:42:37,898
- We passed Round One.
- Well done.

1227
00:42:38,598 --> 00:42:39,637
Okay.

1228
00:42:39,638 --> 00:42:41,137
(A favorable start)

1229
00:42:41,138 --> 00:42:42,198
We did it.

1230
00:42:43,038 --> 00:42:44,168
- Gosh.
- Awesome.

1231
00:42:44,568 --> 00:42:46,237
- Round One, success!
- Success!

1232
00:42:46,238 --> 00:42:48,278
- It's a good start.
- What a good start.

1233
00:42:48,738 --> 00:42:49,778
We have a good start.

1234
00:42:50,178 --> 00:42:52,147
- Great.
- I had my doubts.

1235
00:42:52,148 --> 00:42:53,218
Great job.

1236
00:42:53,378 --> 00:42:54,817
- Go or stop.
- Go.

1237
00:42:54,818 --> 00:42:55,877
In 1, 2, 3.

1238
00:42:55,878 --> 00:42:57,187
- Go.
- Of course.

1239
00:42:57,188 --> 00:42:58,817
- Really.
- We've got many tries left.

1240
00:42:58,818 --> 00:43:01,098
- We succeeded on the 1st try.
- Let's check out Round 2.

1241
00:43:02,288 --> 00:43:05,658
"Perfect healing weekends with pilates and morning soccer games."

1242
00:43:06,158 --> 00:43:08,698
"L pilates workout set and M soccer cleats."

1243
00:43:09,868 --> 00:43:11,628
- That's good.
- Yes.

1244
00:43:12,528 --> 00:43:15,838
(Round 2 prize: Workout set and soccer cleats)

1245
00:43:16,238 --> 00:43:18,408
Workout clothes and soccer cleats.

1246
00:43:18,508 --> 00:43:20,137
- Gosh.
- I want to succeed so badly.

1247
00:43:20,138 --> 00:43:22,277
Tell us what Round Two is.

1248
00:43:22,278 --> 00:43:23,278
(Round 2)

1249
00:43:23,279 --> 00:43:25,708
(1 rattlesnake magnet is added.)

1250
00:43:26,818 --> 00:43:27,947
- Five.
- Yes, there are five beads.

1251
00:43:27,948 --> 00:43:29,078
Beads?

1252
00:43:29,378 --> 00:43:30,588
The rattlesnake magnet.

1253
00:43:31,088 --> 00:43:33,218
- Someone has to place two down.
- Yes.

1254
00:43:34,618 --> 00:43:36,888
There's not much space to put it down.

1255
00:43:37,128 --> 00:43:38,128
- How about we drive...
- Five.

1256
00:43:38,129 --> 00:43:40,098
The bead to each end?

1257
00:43:40,328 --> 00:43:42,008
The beads are fighting each other already.

1258
00:43:42,228 --> 00:43:43,867
(The two beads have a stronger sense of self.)

1259
00:43:43,868 --> 00:43:44,927
What's going on?

1260
00:43:44,928 --> 00:43:46,768
(The two beads have a stronger sense of self.)

1261
00:43:47,868 --> 00:43:49,268
Lure the beads to each side?

1262
00:43:52,838 --> 00:43:54,038
(Moving)

1263
00:43:54,478 --> 00:43:55,978
Nice one.

1264
00:43:56,578 --> 00:43:57,608
It's a good idea.

1265
00:43:57,808 --> 00:43:59,618
(SULLYOON's separation strategy)

1266
00:44:00,178 --> 00:44:01,847
- First off...
- Let's go right away.

1267
00:44:01,848 --> 00:44:03,148
Let's try right away.

1268
00:44:03,618 --> 00:44:04,718
- Let's do that.
- Okay.

1269
00:44:04,948 --> 00:44:06,858
SULLYOON is good at it. She gets two magnets.

1270
00:44:06,988 --> 00:44:08,257
- Do 2.
- You do 2.

1271
00:44:08,258 --> 00:44:10,458
- Good luck.
- In 1, 2, 3.

1272
00:44:10,528 --> 00:44:11,557
- Here we go.
- Here we go.

1273
00:44:11,558 --> 00:44:14,097
Firstly, these two.

1274
00:44:14,098 --> 00:44:15,958
(Starting to separate them)

1275
00:44:22,498 --> 00:44:23,668
She's like a magician.

1276
00:44:25,338 --> 00:44:27,307
(SULLYOON is currently practicing magic.)

1277
00:44:27,308 --> 00:44:28,407
- Good.
- Done.

1278
00:44:28,408 --> 00:44:30,048
(SULLYOON is currently practicing magic.)

1279
00:44:30,608 --> 00:44:31,647
(She has to place it down now.)

1280
00:44:31,648 --> 00:44:33,478
- You're good.
- Nice.

1281
00:44:36,218 --> 00:44:37,318
That close?

1282
00:44:38,048 --> 00:44:39,718
- It's not moving.
- I used that thing.

1283
00:44:42,158 --> 00:44:43,228
Nice one.

1284
00:44:43,828 --> 00:44:44,828
(She is an ace on another level.)

1285
00:44:44,829 --> 00:44:46,057
- Second?
- Next.

1286
00:44:46,058 --> 00:44:47,698
- She's very strategic.
- I agree.

1287
00:44:48,128 --> 00:44:49,157
Yeon Shik.

1288
00:44:49,158 --> 00:44:51,727
(2nd try)

1289
00:44:51,728 --> 00:44:53,368
(Indecisive)

1290
00:44:55,868 --> 00:44:57,067
Just put it down over there.

1291
00:44:57,068 --> 00:44:58,268
(Just put it down over there.)

1292
00:44:58,408 --> 00:44:59,777
(The scaredy cat is upset.)

1293
00:44:59,778 --> 00:45:01,908
That was unnecessarily nerve-wracking.

1294
00:45:02,638 --> 00:45:05,047
- Jae Suk, I was feeling it out.
- Is that so?

1295
00:45:05,048 --> 00:45:07,448
- If it'd move or not.
- Just place it down.

1296
00:45:10,648 --> 00:45:12,218
(Far away)

1297
00:45:12,848 --> 00:45:13,918
Good.

1298
00:45:14,858 --> 00:45:16,458
- We might succeed in second try.
- Yes.

1299
00:45:20,898 --> 00:45:21,898
(Moving again)

1300
00:45:21,899 --> 00:45:22,998
That should be okay.

1301
00:45:23,968 --> 00:45:25,028
- Oh, no.
- Gosh.

1302
00:45:25,668 --> 00:45:26,698
- Haewon.
- Okay.

1303
00:45:27,468 --> 00:45:28,568
Good luck.

1304
00:45:29,538 --> 00:45:30,737
- It's moving.
- The magnets...

1305
00:45:30,738 --> 00:45:32,338
are moving as the gaps get closer.

1306
00:45:35,778 --> 00:45:36,878
That seems fine.

1307
00:45:39,778 --> 00:45:41,478
- Oh, dear.
- Okay.

1308
00:45:41,978 --> 00:45:44,088
Okay. Now...

1309
00:45:44,418 --> 00:45:45,788
Be careful.

1310
00:45:45,888 --> 00:45:48,418
- Now...
- Be careful.

1311
00:45:49,018 --> 00:45:50,488
(Placing it in the center?)

1312
00:45:50,558 --> 00:45:51,588
Be careful.

1313
00:45:52,188 --> 00:45:53,198
(Putting it down)

1314
00:45:53,698 --> 00:45:54,698
That's a good idea.

1315
00:45:55,458 --> 00:45:57,098
- One, two, - Two,

1316
00:45:57,498 --> 00:46:00,197
- Three, four, five.
- three, four, five.

1317
00:46:00,198 --> 00:46:01,238
Success!

1318
00:46:02,138 --> 00:46:03,408
The center was impressive.

1319
00:46:04,608 --> 00:46:05,608
Success!

1320
00:46:05,608 --> 00:46:06,608
(Hitting the dead center was a bold move!)

1321
00:46:06,609 --> 00:46:08,237
- The center was impressive.
- Success!

1322
00:46:08,238 --> 00:46:09,407
(Cheering)

1323
00:46:09,408 --> 00:46:11,377
- The center was impressive.
- The center, right?

1324
00:46:11,378 --> 00:46:12,678
The center was a nice one.

1325
00:46:12,808 --> 00:46:13,847
- The center was great.
- Gosh.

1326
00:46:13,848 --> 00:46:15,278
- SULLYOON is incredible.
- Right?

1327
00:46:15,618 --> 00:46:16,688
It was like...

1328
00:46:17,318 --> 00:46:18,447
- She's practically a magician.
- It was magic.

1329
00:46:18,448 --> 00:46:21,218
She's indeed a magician.

1330
00:46:21,758 --> 00:46:23,988
- Now then, the last round.
- Round Three.

1331
00:46:24,528 --> 00:46:26,157
All right. Round Three.

1332
00:46:26,158 --> 00:46:27,957
Go or stop? In 1, 2, 3.

1333
00:46:27,958 --> 00:46:29,028
- Go.
- Go.

1334
00:46:29,458 --> 00:46:30,527
It's a given.

1335
00:46:30,528 --> 00:46:31,898
We still have many tries left.

1336
00:46:32,168 --> 00:46:33,998
- We have ourselves a magician.
- It's...

1337
00:46:34,768 --> 00:46:35,798
What does it say?

1338
00:46:35,938 --> 00:46:39,337
"Unity is a part of research for team spirit."

1339
00:46:39,338 --> 00:46:40,577
"One thousand dollars for a get-together."

1340
00:46:40,578 --> 00:46:41,977
(Round 3 prize: 1,000 dollars for a get-together)

1341
00:46:41,978 --> 00:46:43,108
One thousand dollars?

1342
00:46:43,678 --> 00:46:45,077
- A 50-dollar bill.
- They look the happiest.

1343
00:46:45,078 --> 00:46:46,207
(A 50-dollar bill has entered.)

1344
00:46:46,208 --> 00:46:47,318
Literally the happiest.

1345
00:46:47,448 --> 00:46:49,318
- It's been cut out.
- In 50-dollar bills.

1346
00:46:49,678 --> 00:46:50,748
Fifty-dollar bills.

1347
00:46:51,448 --> 00:46:53,117
What's Round Three?

1348
00:46:53,118 --> 00:46:54,317
(Round 3)

1349
00:46:54,318 --> 00:46:57,028
(The circle gets smaller.)

1350
00:47:00,898 --> 00:47:01,998
- We can do it.
- Yes.

1351
00:47:02,198 --> 00:47:03,527
The number of magnets remains the same.

1352
00:47:03,528 --> 00:47:05,098
(5 rattlesnake magnets, like earlier)

1353
00:47:05,428 --> 00:47:06,698
This one looks tough.

1354
00:47:07,138 --> 00:47:08,897
- It doesn't look easy.
- I agree.

1355
00:47:08,898 --> 00:47:10,038
It looks hard.

1356
00:47:10,668 --> 00:47:12,637
- We're running out of time.
- The magician...

1357
00:47:12,638 --> 00:47:14,114
- Shall we try right away?
- Drive them to the end...

1358
00:47:14,138 --> 00:47:15,538
- Right away?
- We might...

1359
00:47:15,578 --> 00:47:16,607
- succeed.
- For now...

1360
00:47:16,608 --> 00:47:18,907
- It's our 3rd try. In 1, 2, 3.
- Okay.

1361
00:47:18,908 --> 00:47:19,917
- Here we go.
- Here we go.

1362
00:47:19,918 --> 00:47:21,078
Let's drive them to the ends.

1363
00:47:21,718 --> 00:47:22,977
(The magic begins.)

1364
00:47:22,978 --> 00:47:24,017
Our magician.

1365
00:47:24,018 --> 00:47:25,248
(The magic begins.)

1366
00:47:27,188 --> 00:47:29,217
(At a loss)

1367
00:47:29,218 --> 00:47:30,228
It's at a loss.

1368
00:47:30,788 --> 00:47:32,088
(It safely landed.)

1369
00:47:32,258 --> 00:47:33,357
Good.

1370
00:47:33,358 --> 00:47:35,028
(She tries to put it down now.)

1371
00:47:36,898 --> 00:47:37,928
It's coming.

1372
00:47:43,508 --> 00:47:44,508
I didn't put it down yet.

1373
00:47:45,238 --> 00:47:46,538
It's over once you let it go?

1374
00:47:51,048 --> 00:47:52,477
You made a risky choice.

1375
00:47:52,478 --> 00:47:53,548
She's bold.

1376
00:47:54,618 --> 00:47:56,548
I think they should be closer.

1377
00:47:58,488 --> 00:47:59,548
I can't do this.

1378
00:48:00,618 --> 00:48:01,657
- Why?
- Wait!

1379
00:48:01,658 --> 00:48:02,658
(Scared)

1380
00:48:02,659 --> 00:48:03,927
It's here.

1381
00:48:03,928 --> 00:48:05,157
Think about it.

1382
00:48:05,158 --> 00:48:07,227
It's pulling from this side, so pull it from this side.

1383
00:48:07,228 --> 00:48:08,497
(Balancing it by putting it here)

1384
00:48:08,498 --> 00:48:09,798
Let's balance it out.

1385
00:48:10,228 --> 00:48:11,567
- Good luck.
- Find the balance.

1386
00:48:11,568 --> 00:48:12,968
(Yeon Seok will put it down first.)

1387
00:48:15,198 --> 00:48:16,368
(Shaking)

1388
00:48:17,908 --> 00:48:19,567
- If we all succeed once, - It's reacting.

1389
00:48:19,568 --> 00:48:20,578
That'd be great.

1390
00:48:20,908 --> 00:48:23,348
- I think it's on the other side.
- It looks all right to me.

1391
00:48:24,008 --> 00:48:25,478
- But...
- It's good.

1392
00:48:26,308 --> 00:48:27,748
- All right.
- Let's put one here.

1393
00:48:28,578 --> 00:48:31,094
Let's put these two here and there, and last one in the middle.

1394
00:48:31,118 --> 00:48:32,118
It might end this time.

1395
00:48:35,218 --> 00:48:37,427
Or should we push it over here...

1396
00:48:37,428 --> 00:48:38,428
and put two here?

1397
00:48:38,728 --> 00:48:40,628
I'm worried it'll stick as I move it.

1398
00:48:41,298 --> 00:48:42,358
Okay.

1399
00:48:42,958 --> 00:48:44,598
It's already begun.

1400
00:48:44,698 --> 00:48:46,498
It's twitching.

1401
00:48:47,168 --> 00:48:48,897
(Haewon's assist)

1402
00:48:48,898 --> 00:48:51,338
- Who...
- That's good.

1403
00:48:51,968 --> 00:48:53,208
I'll go.

1404
00:48:55,778 --> 00:48:58,548
We've only put down 3. We need 2 more.

1405
00:49:01,478 --> 00:49:03,388
- Do I put it here?
- Try it.

1406
00:49:04,018 --> 00:49:05,187
(Haewon's turn)

1407
00:49:05,188 --> 00:49:06,218
(Try number 3)

1408
00:49:12,258 --> 00:49:14,628
- It's okay.
- It's okay.

1409
00:49:16,028 --> 00:49:18,028
(Sneezing)

1410
00:49:19,398 --> 00:49:20,568
(Sneezing)

1411
00:49:21,938 --> 00:49:23,268
(What?)

1412
00:49:25,308 --> 00:49:26,578
It was the sneeze.

1413
00:49:27,108 --> 00:49:29,077
(Ruining everything with a sneeze)

1414
00:49:29,078 --> 00:49:30,447
I didn't put it down yet.

1415
00:49:30,448 --> 00:49:31,448
(You scared us.)

1416
00:49:31,449 --> 00:49:32,608
Gosh.

1417
00:49:32,878 --> 00:49:34,347
Why did I have to sneeze?

1418
00:49:34,348 --> 00:49:36,717
(They fail due to his sneeze.)

1419
00:49:36,718 --> 00:49:38,548
(Giggling)

1420
00:49:38,718 --> 00:49:40,288
How did a sneeze get in our way?

1421
00:49:40,758 --> 00:49:42,518
- One more time.
- Let's go once more.

1422
00:49:42,558 --> 00:49:43,727
- In 1, 2, 3.
- In 1, 2, 3.

1423
00:49:43,728 --> 00:49:45,027
- Let's go!
- Let's go!

1424
00:49:45,028 --> 00:49:46,228
It's try number four.

1425
00:49:48,598 --> 00:49:53,438
(She rearranges them with magic.)

1426
00:49:53,738 --> 00:49:54,798
She's bold.

1427
00:49:55,068 --> 00:49:57,037
It was a good attempt by SULLYOON.

1428
00:49:57,038 --> 00:49:58,608
(Haewon holds it in place.)

1429
00:50:00,908 --> 00:50:02,008
Or...

1430
00:50:03,138 --> 00:50:05,478
(Failure)

1431
00:50:09,448 --> 00:50:10,887
(What just happened?)

1432
00:50:10,888 --> 00:50:13,287
It floated all of a sudden.

1433
00:50:13,288 --> 00:50:14,518
It jumped up.

1434
00:50:15,858 --> 00:50:17,557
- Why...
- That startled me.

1435
00:50:17,558 --> 00:50:19,657
It just popped up. It's our pet magnet.

1436
00:50:19,658 --> 00:50:22,027
This is Round Three.

1437
00:50:22,028 --> 00:50:23,427
- We can't let our guards down.
- We can't.

1438
00:50:23,428 --> 00:50:26,068
We'll lose everything if we let our guards down.

1439
00:50:26,368 --> 00:50:27,667
Round Three is tough.

1440
00:50:27,668 --> 00:50:29,537
- We have five tries left.
- It's too small.

1441
00:50:29,538 --> 00:50:31,767
- Let's go again. In 1, 2, 3.
- This is...

1442
00:50:31,768 --> 00:50:32,968
- Here we go.
- Here we go.

1443
00:50:35,138 --> 00:50:36,707
(She starts using her magic.)

1444
00:50:36,708 --> 00:50:37,848
You are driving them nicely.

1445
00:50:40,048 --> 00:50:42,577
- It might jump up again.
- Careful.

1446
00:50:42,578 --> 00:50:43,918
I think it'll jump.

1447
00:50:47,558 --> 00:50:49,158
(No!)

1448
00:50:54,958 --> 00:50:56,298
(She saved it!)

1449
00:50:57,798 --> 00:50:59,427
(Haewon's support)

1450
00:50:59,428 --> 00:51:01,567
Well done, Haewon.

1451
00:51:01,568 --> 00:51:02,738
That was good.

1452
00:51:03,408 --> 00:51:05,438
(Their hearts sank.)

1453
00:51:05,668 --> 00:51:07,437
Let's keep them here.

1454
00:51:07,438 --> 00:51:09,877
- This is good enough.
- We can't go any further.

1455
00:51:09,878 --> 00:51:11,207
- I caught it.
- You did.

1456
00:51:11,208 --> 00:51:12,408
Now, put them down.

1457
00:51:17,048 --> 00:51:19,418
- Seriously.
- They've gotten...

1458
00:51:20,388 --> 00:51:21,758
extra sensitive.

1459
00:51:22,258 --> 00:51:23,558
I feel like they have egos.

1460
00:51:25,688 --> 00:51:26,757
Gosh.

1461
00:51:26,758 --> 00:51:27,927
(Doing her best to help)

1462
00:51:27,928 --> 00:51:29,398
Don't move.

1463
00:51:29,528 --> 00:51:31,198
SULLYOON, put it here.

1464
00:51:31,298 --> 00:51:32,928
- Wait.
- Gentle.

1465
00:51:34,238 --> 00:51:35,737
You're really bold.

1466
00:51:35,738 --> 00:51:37,408
It doesn't know where to go.

1467
00:51:37,468 --> 00:51:39,208
(Safe)

1468
00:51:40,208 --> 00:51:41,738
(Jae Suk's turn)

1469
00:51:42,378 --> 00:51:44,748
I'll put it far away.

1470
00:51:46,678 --> 00:51:48,378
(Pass)

1471
00:51:49,718 --> 00:51:51,188
My gosh.

1472
00:51:51,788 --> 00:51:53,048
(Rolling)

1473
00:51:56,018 --> 00:51:57,428
This is so tricky.

1474
00:51:58,458 --> 00:52:00,727
- What do we do?
- But it wasn't...

1475
00:52:00,728 --> 00:52:01,897
It wasn't a proper circle.

1476
00:52:01,898 --> 00:52:03,198
Right. It was crushed.

1477
00:52:04,198 --> 00:52:06,528
Haewon knows how to wake them up.

1478
00:52:07,498 --> 00:52:08,967
- I think...
- They were sound asleep.

1479
00:52:08,968 --> 00:52:11,437
I think I should go first...

1480
00:52:11,438 --> 00:52:12,707
and leave.

1481
00:52:12,708 --> 00:52:14,514
- The beads are looking lively now.
- They are...

1482
00:52:14,538 --> 00:52:16,277
- They're...
- They're looking lively.

1483
00:52:16,278 --> 00:52:18,407
- Yes. They're...
- They're awake.

1484
00:52:18,408 --> 00:52:20,217
- It's so hard.
- Now that the circle is smaller...

1485
00:52:20,218 --> 00:52:21,448
- Yes.
- Yes.

1486
00:52:21,518 --> 00:52:23,417
- We're running out of time.
- Gosh.

1487
00:52:23,418 --> 00:52:24,918
This is really tricky.

1488
00:52:25,148 --> 00:52:26,387
There's no point in practicing.

1489
00:52:26,388 --> 00:52:28,357
In 1, 2, 3.

1490
00:52:28,358 --> 00:52:29,387
Here we go.

1491
00:52:29,388 --> 00:52:30,858
I'll go first.

1492
00:52:31,058 --> 00:52:32,688
- Are you going first?
- Yes.

1493
00:52:33,698 --> 00:52:34,798
Are you sure?

1494
00:52:36,728 --> 00:52:39,768
(He puts it in the farthest corner.)

1495
00:52:40,968 --> 00:52:42,098
Good.

1496
00:52:42,338 --> 00:52:43,667
- Haewon, why don't you...
- Okay.

1497
00:52:43,668 --> 00:52:44,908
(Next, the human alarm, Haewon)

1498
00:52:47,908 --> 00:52:49,908
(Shaking)

1499
00:52:54,018 --> 00:52:55,178
Good.

1500
00:52:56,748 --> 00:52:58,617
This is looking good.

1501
00:52:58,618 --> 00:53:00,187
(Try number 7)

1502
00:53:00,188 --> 00:53:02,988
It's hopeless once they start waking up.

1503
00:53:05,228 --> 00:53:06,258
Careful.

1504
00:53:07,228 --> 00:53:08,298
Careful.

1505
00:53:10,928 --> 00:53:12,027
(Calm)

1506
00:53:12,028 --> 00:53:13,868
You have to be risky to a certain point.

1507
00:53:14,368 --> 00:53:15,667
- To a certain point.
- Good.

1508
00:53:15,668 --> 00:53:17,268
- Two more.
- This is...

1509
00:53:17,308 --> 00:53:18,308
- To a certain point.
- Good.

1510
00:53:18,308 --> 00:53:19,308
(They have two left.)

1511
00:53:19,538 --> 00:53:21,038
Good. Two more.

1512
00:53:21,308 --> 00:53:22,438
They're pretty far apart.

1513
00:53:22,808 --> 00:53:24,178
SULLYOON is bold.

1514
00:53:24,278 --> 00:53:25,747
- To a certain point.
- This, this, and middle?

1515
00:53:25,748 --> 00:53:27,377
- Where? Here and here?
- Here and here.

1516
00:53:27,378 --> 00:53:28,717
- Vertically.
- Okay.

1517
00:53:28,718 --> 00:53:29,718
We could put one near the end...

1518
00:53:29,719 --> 00:53:31,818
and the last one at the center, right?

1519
00:53:32,418 --> 00:53:33,517
Why does this one keep...

1520
00:53:33,518 --> 00:53:34,917
Stay still!

1521
00:53:34,918 --> 00:53:36,688
Stay still. Calm down.

1522
00:53:37,128 --> 00:53:38,327
Okay.

1523
00:53:38,328 --> 00:53:39,358
(Docile)

1524
00:53:40,358 --> 00:53:41,397
This one's crucial.

1525
00:53:41,398 --> 00:53:42,574
(Yeon Seok approaches solemnly.)

1526
00:53:42,598 --> 00:53:44,027
(Polite)

1527
00:53:44,028 --> 00:53:45,368
You want to place it vertically?

1528
00:53:50,868 --> 00:53:51,907
(Moving)

1529
00:53:51,908 --> 00:53:53,208
Why...

1530
00:53:53,408 --> 00:53:54,437
(Laughing)

1531
00:53:54,438 --> 00:53:55,707
- It makes me hold my breath.
- It's moving.

1532
00:53:55,708 --> 00:53:57,548
We can't do anything about the twitches.

1533
00:53:59,748 --> 00:54:01,517
(It's hard to put it at the center.)

1534
00:54:01,518 --> 00:54:02,718
Like this?

1535
00:54:05,818 --> 00:54:07,087
Last one.

1536
00:54:07,088 --> 00:54:09,258
(He put it down.)

1537
00:54:09,418 --> 00:54:12,028
Wait.

1538
00:54:12,488 --> 00:54:13,827
It's trying to move. It keeps turning.

1539
00:54:13,828 --> 00:54:15,427
That's okay.

1540
00:54:15,428 --> 00:54:16,428
(The magnet keeps turning.)

1541
00:54:16,429 --> 00:54:17,728
It'll roll after it turns.

1542
00:54:19,598 --> 00:54:21,638
- It turns.
- Leave it.

1543
00:54:22,438 --> 00:54:24,508
- It's turning on its own.
- Leave it.

1544
00:54:25,068 --> 00:54:27,837
- Wait.
- It's turning on its own.

1545
00:54:27,838 --> 00:54:28,977
I didn't take my hand off yet.

1546
00:54:28,978 --> 00:54:31,847
- Wait. Don't move!
- Please stop moving.

1547
00:54:31,848 --> 00:54:33,577
Yeon Shik, move back a little.

1548
00:54:33,578 --> 00:54:35,338
- It's turning.
- They'll all come together.

1549
00:54:35,518 --> 00:54:37,387
It's turning counter-clockwise.

1550
00:54:37,388 --> 00:54:38,688
Done.

1551
00:54:39,748 --> 00:54:40,988
(It stopped!)

1552
00:54:41,518 --> 00:54:42,918
(Exclaiming)

1553
00:54:43,158 --> 00:54:44,728
Okay.

1554
00:54:45,558 --> 00:54:46,657
Okay.

1555
00:54:46,658 --> 00:54:48,758
(One last magnet)

1556
00:54:48,958 --> 00:54:49,997
Okay.

1557
00:54:49,998 --> 00:54:52,468
(The success of Round 3 lies in SULLYOON's hands.)

1558
00:54:53,028 --> 00:54:55,238
Hey!

1559
00:54:55,898 --> 00:54:57,837
Do something about that.

1560
00:54:57,838 --> 00:55:00,278
(One bead awakens.)

1561
00:55:00,938 --> 00:55:02,838
Put it to sleep first.

1562
00:55:03,678 --> 00:55:04,708
Do it slowly.

1563
00:55:04,908 --> 00:55:07,247
- You need to go in slowly.
- SULLYOON.

1564
00:55:07,248 --> 00:55:09,317
They're extremely sensitive right now.

1565
00:55:09,318 --> 00:55:11,688
- There's a tiny opening.
- Yes.

1566
00:55:12,018 --> 00:55:13,218
Should I move it first?

1567
00:55:14,588 --> 00:55:15,717
Should I move it first?

1568
00:55:15,718 --> 00:55:17,257
(It's definitely awake!)

1569
00:55:17,258 --> 00:55:18,887
SULLYOON, that's good. You need to stop.

1570
00:55:18,888 --> 00:55:21,857
- What do we do with this?
- It's fighting the magnetism.

1571
00:55:21,858 --> 00:55:22,938
What's wrong with this one?

1572
00:55:23,328 --> 00:55:24,328
Why...

1573
00:55:24,329 --> 00:55:25,427
- It's because there are too many.
- It's...

1574
00:55:25,428 --> 00:55:27,868
- surrounded by magnets.
- Exactly.

1575
00:55:28,468 --> 00:55:29,468
Gosh.

1576
00:55:29,838 --> 00:55:31,668
- Where should I place it?
- It's...

1577
00:55:32,268 --> 00:55:34,077
- This one is...
- Maybe a little...

1578
00:55:34,078 --> 00:55:36,638
- I need it to come a little closer.
- That's true.

1579
00:55:38,278 --> 00:55:40,518
This guy is so sensitive.

1580
00:55:41,278 --> 00:55:42,278
But it's...

1581
00:55:42,448 --> 00:55:43,618
It's going to jump up again.

1582
00:55:46,918 --> 00:55:48,858
(No!)

1583
00:55:49,788 --> 00:55:50,927
That's good.

1584
00:55:50,928 --> 00:55:51,928
(Indecisive)

1585
00:55:51,929 --> 00:55:53,928
Put it in the corner.

1586
00:55:54,298 --> 00:55:55,797
(She finds an opening.)

1587
00:55:55,798 --> 00:55:57,098
- Good.
- In the corner.

1588
00:55:59,668 --> 00:56:01,438
- It keeps moving.
- No.

1589
00:56:07,838 --> 00:56:08,877
- Just put it down.
- What do I do?

1590
00:56:08,878 --> 00:56:11,278
Look at that!

1591
00:56:12,178 --> 00:56:14,117
- That's better.
- It worked.

1592
00:56:14,118 --> 00:56:15,547
There's an opening.

1593
00:56:15,548 --> 00:56:17,617
- There!
- That spot is empty.

1594
00:56:17,618 --> 00:56:19,788
- I can't do this.
- Right here.

1595
00:56:20,758 --> 00:56:23,117
In the corner. Yes, you're doing it.

1596
00:56:23,118 --> 00:56:26,328
In the corner. Yes, you're doing it.

1597
00:56:27,398 --> 00:56:28,598
Four.

1598
00:56:28,898 --> 00:56:31,027
Two, one. Success!

1599
00:56:31,028 --> 00:56:34,268
(Success)

1600
00:56:35,498 --> 00:56:36,567
(Jumping up and down)

1601
00:56:36,568 --> 00:56:38,067
- Yes!
- We did it.

1602
00:56:38,068 --> 00:56:40,478
(They can't believe they won.)

1603
00:56:43,648 --> 00:56:44,978
SULLYOON, you've done it.

1604
00:56:46,478 --> 00:56:47,917
- We did it.
- No way.

1605
00:56:47,918 --> 00:56:50,077
- All right.
- Round Three is...

1606
00:56:50,078 --> 00:56:51,187
- a success!
- Success!

1607
00:56:51,188 --> 00:56:53,757
(They get gas gift cards, workout sets, and 1,000 dollars.)

1608
00:56:53,758 --> 00:56:55,057
Thank you!

1609
00:56:55,058 --> 00:56:56,258
Thank you so much.

1610
00:56:56,688 --> 00:56:57,827
My hands are sweaty.

1611
00:56:57,828 --> 00:56:59,058
You did an excellent job.

1612
00:56:59,728 --> 00:57:01,998
- That was great.
- You moved it a little.

1613
00:57:02,198 --> 00:57:04,167
We finally broke the jinx.

1614
00:57:04,168 --> 00:57:06,728
(After 3 consecutive losses, they finally succeed in Daejeon.)

1615
00:57:06,998 --> 00:57:08,037
(They pleasantly pass Round 3.)

1616
00:57:08,038 --> 00:57:10,868
- We finally did it in Daejeon.
- Great work.

1617
00:57:13,778 --> 00:57:16,237
- That was gratifying.
- It was thrilling.

1618
00:57:16,238 --> 00:57:18,708
- I'm relieved.
- It's a load off my chest.

1619
00:57:18,878 --> 00:57:20,418
(The magician of success)

1620
00:57:20,718 --> 00:57:23,447
- Let's check our last guest.
- Let's check that.

1621
00:57:23,448 --> 00:57:24,717
It might be a good idea...

1622
00:57:24,718 --> 00:57:26,587
to eat near where we're going.

1623
00:57:26,588 --> 00:57:28,794
- Near where we're going?
- Where do you think we're going?

1624
00:57:28,818 --> 00:57:30,217
If I know a place there,

1625
00:57:30,218 --> 00:57:31,287
- Really?
- I'll take you.

1626
00:57:31,288 --> 00:57:33,898
- Then...
- Finally, something in Daejeon...

1627
00:57:33,958 --> 00:57:35,028
"Finally."

1628
00:57:35,258 --> 00:57:36,598
- We're going to...
- Yes.

1629
00:57:37,168 --> 00:57:39,768
Daedongcheonuan?

1630
00:57:40,268 --> 00:57:41,367
Daedongcheonu?

1631
00:57:41,368 --> 00:57:43,598
- Daedongcheonuan 5-gil.
- What's this?

1632
00:57:43,738 --> 00:57:46,508
Daedongcheonuan.

1633
00:57:46,638 --> 00:57:48,037
Please increase the font on the card.

1634
00:57:48,038 --> 00:57:49,438
(He struggled to read the address.)

1635
00:57:49,838 --> 00:57:51,507
(She gets it instantly and looks it up.)

1636
00:57:51,508 --> 00:57:52,607
- Then, - Daedongcheonuan.

1637
00:57:52,608 --> 00:57:54,017
- we can eat in Euneungjeongi.
- If you can...

1638
00:57:54,018 --> 00:57:55,698
- focus on it...
- Should we eat kalguksu?

1639
00:57:55,878 --> 00:57:57,417
No, I can read it fine.

1640
00:57:57,418 --> 00:57:59,217
- It's an issue for him.
- This place isn't bad.

1641
00:57:59,218 --> 00:58:00,887
She knows a kalguksu place.

1642
00:58:00,888 --> 00:58:01,957
In that area?

1643
00:58:01,958 --> 00:58:03,257
Yes. I know about three kalguksu places.

1644
00:58:03,258 --> 00:58:04,928
- Let's go there!
- Great.

1645
00:58:05,188 --> 00:58:06,527
Kalguksu it is. To the nearest...

1646
00:58:06,528 --> 00:58:07,827
- Let's go!
- Let's go.

1647
00:58:07,828 --> 00:58:09,097
- Great.
- "5-gil."

1648
00:58:09,098 --> 00:58:11,198
- All right. You know, - Where is it?

1649
00:58:11,328 --> 00:58:12,697
- with SULLYOON...
- Gimhwa Kalguksu.

1650
00:58:12,698 --> 00:58:13,698
Gimhwa?

1651
00:58:14,068 --> 00:58:16,098
The weather's nice.

1652
00:58:16,238 --> 00:58:17,838
This place looks great.

1653
00:58:17,968 --> 00:58:19,008
I can't wait to eat it.

1654
00:58:19,108 --> 00:58:21,338
- Our magician.
- Why, thank you.

1655
00:58:21,408 --> 00:58:22,977
- Thank you.
- Our magician.

1656
00:58:22,978 --> 00:58:24,847
- Magician.
- She's truly a magician.

1657
00:58:24,848 --> 00:58:26,548
Yes, the magnet magician.

1658
00:58:27,618 --> 00:58:29,377
- Let's go to Gimhwa Kalguksu.
- Sure.

1659
00:58:29,378 --> 00:58:31,224
(To a kalguksu place in Daejeon that SULLYOON picked)

1660
00:58:31,248 --> 00:58:32,917
I feel much better now.

1661
00:58:32,918 --> 00:58:35,017
- Yes, after passing Round 3...
- Passing Round 3...

1662
00:58:35,018 --> 00:58:36,317
- It certainly feels different.
- It's such a relief.

1663
00:58:36,318 --> 00:58:37,458
I can't help but hum.

1664
00:58:38,588 --> 00:58:41,298
(Humming)

1665
00:58:41,328 --> 00:58:44,198
(They can't help but hum.)

1666
00:58:44,628 --> 00:58:47,028
You've never been to this kalguksu place, right?

1667
00:58:47,238 --> 00:58:49,297
No. But my friends highly recommended it.

1668
00:58:49,298 --> 00:58:50,807
Your friends in Daejeon?

1669
00:58:50,808 --> 00:58:52,467
Yes. They're my friends from middle school.

1670
00:58:52,468 --> 00:58:53,508
I see.

1671
00:58:53,608 --> 00:58:55,377
- That area is...
- The main street?

1672
00:58:55,378 --> 00:58:56,637
- Is it downtown?
- It's downtown.

1673
00:58:56,638 --> 00:58:58,048
Oh, downtown.

1674
00:58:58,408 --> 00:59:00,308
- Right. Downtown.
- Downtown.

1675
00:59:01,078 --> 00:59:02,378
Don't they use that word...

1676
00:59:02,748 --> 00:59:04,217
- Not in Seoul.
- No.

1677
00:59:04,218 --> 00:59:05,647
People don't use that word in Seoul.

1678
00:59:05,648 --> 00:59:07,518
- Everywhere is downtown in Seoul.
- Right.

1679
00:59:07,918 --> 00:59:09,457
That's true.

1680
00:59:09,458 --> 00:59:10,527
People in Seoul...

1681
00:59:10,528 --> 00:59:12,057
- rarely say "downtown."
- Right.

1682
00:59:12,058 --> 00:59:13,457
You normally don't say it, right?

1683
00:59:13,458 --> 00:59:14,628
I don't.

1684
00:59:15,328 --> 00:59:16,697
We're finally going downtown.

1685
00:59:16,698 --> 00:59:18,798
(To downtown Daejeon after passing the tollgate)

1686
00:59:19,628 --> 00:59:21,167
- There it is.
- There it is. On our left.

1687
00:59:21,168 --> 00:59:22,268
- Wait. There's...
- But...

1688
00:59:22,698 --> 00:59:23,937
- Wait. There's a line.
- But...

1689
00:59:23,938 --> 00:59:25,308
are they forming a line?

1690
00:59:25,708 --> 00:59:27,137
- This is...
- But it's kalguksu.

1691
00:59:27,138 --> 00:59:28,208
But it's a weekday.

1692
00:59:28,308 --> 00:59:30,377
It's lunchtime on a weekday.

1693
00:59:30,378 --> 00:59:32,447
There are people waiting in line.

1694
00:59:32,448 --> 00:59:33,708
It's a long line.

1695
00:59:33,918 --> 00:59:35,177
They're just standing there?

1696
00:59:35,178 --> 00:59:36,218
But today...

1697
00:59:37,048 --> 00:59:38,717
It's so cold out.

1698
00:59:38,718 --> 00:59:39,748
It is.

1699
00:59:40,048 --> 00:59:41,528
They're waiting in line for kalguksu?

1700
00:59:42,288 --> 00:59:43,887
- What's going on?
- Should we go somewhere else?

1701
00:59:43,888 --> 00:59:45,327
- I don't think we can go there.
- Let's go somewhere else.

1702
00:59:45,328 --> 00:59:46,787
- Yes.
- That's insane.

1703
00:59:46,788 --> 00:59:48,427
It is a famous place, though.

1704
00:59:48,428 --> 00:59:50,328
- Really?
- How...

1705
00:59:50,968 --> 00:59:53,027
It's cold outside, so...

1706
00:59:53,028 --> 00:59:55,197
If you also like duruchigi with tofu...

1707
00:59:55,198 --> 00:59:57,508
We like everything.

1708
00:59:57,908 --> 00:59:59,238
Maybe some gukbap.

1709
00:59:59,438 --> 01:00:01,037
It's called Daechunamu Kalguksu.

1710
01:00:01,038 --> 01:00:03,038
Daechunamu Kalguksu.

1711
01:00:03,738 --> 01:00:04,908
It's close. Only 500m.

1712
01:00:05,008 --> 01:00:06,048
Really?

1713
01:00:07,008 --> 01:00:09,218
We should expect to wait for 30 minutes.

1714
01:00:10,318 --> 01:00:11,388
At all the restaurants.

1715
01:00:12,118 --> 01:00:13,447
- If they're full, - It's a weekday, so...

1716
01:00:13,448 --> 01:00:14,657
let's eat at the place next door.

1717
01:00:14,658 --> 01:00:15,918
Yes. If we can't,

1718
01:00:16,658 --> 01:00:17,687
- let's eat at the place next door.
- Do you...

1719
01:00:17,688 --> 01:00:18,887
Do you normally wait in line or...

1720
01:00:18,888 --> 01:00:20,387
I've never waited in line before.

1721
01:00:20,388 --> 01:00:21,557
- I...
- Never?

1722
01:00:21,558 --> 01:00:23,697
Like all types of food, so I rarely wait in line...

1723
01:00:23,698 --> 01:00:24,797
- to eat at a restaurant.
- Really?

1724
01:00:24,798 --> 01:00:25,997
Right.

1725
01:00:25,998 --> 01:00:28,398
Haewon and I are similar.

1726
01:00:28,938 --> 01:00:31,908
If the line is too long, I just walk into the place next door.

1727
01:00:32,408 --> 01:00:33,978
I'm even fine with franchises.

1728
01:00:35,978 --> 01:00:37,077
(Laughing awkwardly)

1729
01:00:37,078 --> 01:00:40,178
I'll do you one better. I'm fine with eating at a convenience store.

1730
01:00:41,318 --> 01:00:43,047
(A lonely fight)

1731
01:00:43,048 --> 01:00:45,017
But we came all the way to Daejeon.

1732
01:00:45,018 --> 01:00:46,587
- Let's eat kalguksu.
- Sure.

1733
01:00:46,588 --> 01:00:48,588
I'm curious now that so many people are waiting.

1734
01:00:49,188 --> 01:00:50,217
I've gotten curious.

1735
01:00:50,218 --> 01:00:51,687
- I got curious.
- So did I.

1736
01:00:51,688 --> 01:00:52,757
- I'm just curious.
- How good is it...

1737
01:00:52,758 --> 01:00:54,398
that they're waiting in line for so long?

1738
01:00:54,958 --> 01:00:57,098
I'm going to cry if there's another line here.

1739
01:00:58,368 --> 01:01:00,297
This is it. I don't see a line.

1740
01:01:00,298 --> 01:01:01,337
(It seems quiet.)

1741
01:01:01,338 --> 01:01:03,168
- Please.
- There's no line.

1742
01:01:03,338 --> 01:01:04,437
(There's no line!)

1743
01:01:04,438 --> 01:01:05,567
No line.

1744
01:01:05,568 --> 01:01:07,878
(Cheering)

1745
01:01:08,208 --> 01:01:09,678
Here's the parking lot. On our left.

1746
01:01:10,108 --> 01:01:11,108
Okay.

1747
01:01:11,478 --> 01:01:12,577
(They excitedly walk toward it.)

1748
01:01:12,578 --> 01:01:14,138
This is it, right? Daechunamu Kalguksu.

1749
01:01:14,218 --> 01:01:16,418
- I think so.
- It is.

1750
01:01:16,478 --> 01:01:17,688
There are so many...

1751
01:01:17,848 --> 01:01:18,988
There are many people.

1752
01:01:19,148 --> 01:01:21,057
Are there people waiting?

1753
01:01:21,058 --> 01:01:22,187
Hold on.

1754
01:01:22,188 --> 01:01:23,688
- I can't see anything.
- Me neither.

1755
01:01:24,228 --> 01:01:25,558
I think there's a line.

1756
01:01:26,658 --> 01:01:28,057
Should I ask how many parties there are?

1757
01:01:28,058 --> 01:01:29,127
What's going on?

1758
01:01:29,128 --> 01:01:30,527
- I think they're waiting.
- There's a line.

1759
01:01:30,528 --> 01:01:31,598
Inside?

1760
01:01:31,668 --> 01:01:33,697
The people standing there are...

1761
01:01:33,698 --> 01:01:34,767
- They're all waiting.
- waiting in line.

1762
01:01:34,768 --> 01:01:37,198
Really? Oh, we have to wait here too.

1763
01:01:38,108 --> 01:01:40,038
Kalguksu is pretty popular today.

1764
01:01:40,638 --> 01:01:42,337
What's so special about Daejeon kalguksu?

1765
01:01:42,338 --> 01:01:44,007
- Oh, no.
- What do we do, Yeon Shik?

1766
01:01:44,008 --> 01:01:45,048
Hang on.

1767
01:01:45,608 --> 01:01:47,328
Should we look for one more kalguksu place?

1768
01:01:47,818 --> 01:01:49,517
- Nearby.
- Nearby?

1769
01:01:49,518 --> 01:01:50,847
There's one that takes six minutes on foot.

1770
01:01:50,848 --> 01:01:53,387
- Six minutes? Where?
- Where is it?

1771
01:01:53,388 --> 01:01:55,257
It's called Gongju Spicy Kalguksu and Webfoot Octopus.

1772
01:01:55,258 --> 01:01:56,818
- Let's go there.
- Gongju.

1773
01:01:56,988 --> 01:01:58,857
Gongju Spicy Kalguksu and Webfoot Octopus?

1774
01:01:58,858 --> 01:01:59,887
It already sounds delicious.

1775
01:01:59,888 --> 01:02:01,157
Should I call them and ask...

1776
01:02:01,158 --> 01:02:02,257
- if there's a line?
- Let's do that.

1777
01:02:02,258 --> 01:02:03,697
- I'll call them right now.
- I'll call them.

1778
01:02:03,698 --> 01:02:04,898
I found it.

1779
01:02:08,498 --> 01:02:10,937
- I never imagined.
- I can't believe it's so long.

1780
01:02:10,938 --> 01:02:12,107
(How will plan C go?)

1781
01:02:12,108 --> 01:02:14,278
- Come over here.
- Is there a long line there?

1782
01:02:15,208 --> 01:02:17,847
(What's the result?)

1783
01:02:17,848 --> 01:02:19,948
- Okay.
- There's no line?

1784
01:02:20,278 --> 01:02:21,477
- Let's go.
- Let's go.

1785
01:02:21,478 --> 01:02:22,917
You could have booked a table for us, while you were at it.

1786
01:02:22,918 --> 01:02:23,948
But...

1787
01:02:24,588 --> 01:02:25,788
Don't we have to take our car?

1788
01:02:25,818 --> 01:02:27,048
It's six minutes on foot.

1789
01:02:27,248 --> 01:02:28,687
Also, parking is tough there.

1790
01:02:28,688 --> 01:02:30,218
Okay. Let's walk there.

1791
01:02:31,188 --> 01:02:33,087
We're walking with such light steps now.

1792
01:02:33,088 --> 01:02:34,897
- Yes!
- Hearing that we can eat...

1793
01:02:34,898 --> 01:02:35,957
Wait.

1794
01:02:35,958 --> 01:02:37,327
- It's downtown.
- This is downtown.

1795
01:02:37,328 --> 01:02:38,897
- It's downtown!
- Downtown!

1796
01:02:38,898 --> 01:02:40,097
This is downtown Daejeon.

1797
01:02:40,098 --> 01:02:42,367
(They're in downtown where Sungsimdang is.)

1798
01:02:42,368 --> 01:02:43,698
It smells delicious.

1799
01:02:44,038 --> 01:02:45,368
I smell it.

1800
01:02:45,908 --> 01:02:46,938
This is it.

1801
01:02:47,208 --> 01:02:48,938
- That's a relief.
- We're here.

1802
01:02:49,538 --> 01:02:50,747
(They arrive at the third kalguksu place.)

1803
01:02:50,748 --> 01:02:52,007
It's crowded.

1804
01:02:52,008 --> 01:02:53,277
But there are...

1805
01:02:53,278 --> 01:02:54,377
- We can eat.
- We can eat.

1806
01:02:54,378 --> 01:02:55,938
- There are empty tables.
- We can eat.

1807
01:02:56,318 --> 01:02:57,388
Food!

1808
01:02:57,788 --> 01:02:59,218
- That smell!
- Hello.

1809
01:02:59,288 --> 01:03:00,448
- Great.
- It smells amazing.

1810
01:03:01,058 --> 01:03:02,257
- What a relief.
- What a relief.

1811
01:03:02,258 --> 01:03:03,587
- We're here.
- I'm so relieved.

1812
01:03:03,588 --> 01:03:04,788
So am I.

1813
01:03:05,158 --> 01:03:07,288
- I bet it's good.
- But...

1814
01:03:07,458 --> 01:03:10,598
- SULLYOON, your plan C...
- Seriously.

1815
01:03:11,498 --> 01:03:13,428
I'm glad I looked it up in advance.

1816
01:03:13,768 --> 01:03:14,838
Goodness.

1817
01:03:15,238 --> 01:03:17,707
There's spicy kalguksu and mild kalguksu.

1818
01:03:17,708 --> 01:03:19,267
- Let's eat that.
- They say the spicy one is good.

1819
01:03:19,268 --> 01:03:21,007
- It looks so tasty.
- Let's eat the spicy one.

1820
01:03:21,008 --> 01:03:22,938
- Let's get a spicy one.
- Spicy one.

1821
01:03:23,038 --> 01:03:24,247
Yeon Shik, do you want the mild one?

1822
01:03:24,248 --> 01:03:26,148
I'll take the mild one.

1823
01:03:26,648 --> 01:03:29,147
The webfoot octopus in medium-hot. Three? Two?

1824
01:03:29,148 --> 01:03:30,277
- Three?
- Sure.

1825
01:03:30,278 --> 01:03:31,318
Three?

1826
01:03:31,588 --> 01:03:33,348
Why? Do people normally order four servings?

1827
01:03:33,748 --> 01:03:35,057
No, they were deciding between 2 and 3.

1828
01:03:35,058 --> 01:03:36,818
- Of course, it's three servings.
- Exactly.

1829
01:03:37,658 --> 01:03:39,327
NMIXX members are big eaters.

1830
01:03:39,328 --> 01:03:40,488
Medium-hot.

1831
01:03:41,898 --> 01:03:43,757
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

1832
01:03:43,758 --> 01:03:45,568
- It's pretty big.
- It is.

1833
01:03:46,428 --> 01:03:48,298
- That looks delicious.
- Gosh.

1834
01:03:48,368 --> 01:03:50,667
- The smell is killing me.
- I can't wait.

1835
01:03:50,668 --> 01:03:52,467
Please stir the webfoot octopus once you see steam.

1836
01:03:52,468 --> 01:03:53,638
- Okay.
- Okay.

1837
01:03:53,708 --> 01:03:56,008
Haewon, your eyes have gotten bigger.

1838
01:03:56,808 --> 01:03:58,878
- My appetite is...
- They have.

1839
01:03:58,908 --> 01:04:00,077
(She feels more energetic after seeing food.)

1840
01:04:00,078 --> 01:04:01,477
- They're way bigger.
- Oh, gosh.

1841
01:04:01,478 --> 01:04:03,677
I just hope we get our kalguksu.

1842
01:04:03,678 --> 01:04:05,287
- Me too. I'm so hungry.
- Please.

1843
01:04:05,288 --> 01:04:07,318
- I'm about to eat the plates.
- Seriously.

1844
01:04:07,718 --> 01:04:09,838
It's because we've been searching for a place to eat.

1845
01:04:10,458 --> 01:04:11,757
It's been so long since the last time...

1846
01:04:11,758 --> 01:04:13,057
- That was my very first time.
- I did something like this.

1847
01:04:13,058 --> 01:04:14,897
I've never been to two restaurants for nothing...

1848
01:04:14,898 --> 01:04:15,998
- before.
- Right.

1849
01:04:16,558 --> 01:04:18,068
- I wanted something hot.
- Right.

1850
01:04:18,428 --> 01:04:19,627
It was so cold outside.

1851
01:04:19,628 --> 01:04:20,698
There's our food.

1852
01:04:21,068 --> 01:04:22,237
(Hot kalguksu is here.)

1853
01:04:22,238 --> 01:04:23,297
Whose is it?

1854
01:04:23,298 --> 01:04:24,907
They serve crown daisies on the side.

1855
01:04:24,908 --> 01:04:25,908
Great.

1856
01:04:26,338 --> 01:04:29,108
(Cheering)

1857
01:04:29,638 --> 01:04:31,508
(She makes sure to take photos.)

1858
01:04:31,948 --> 01:04:33,578
- Stop taking photos.
- Okay.

1859
01:04:34,518 --> 01:04:35,877
(Taking a photo)

1860
01:04:35,878 --> 01:04:37,717
Yeon Seok, are you copying them?

1861
01:04:37,718 --> 01:04:39,118
No, I'm not.

1862
01:04:39,188 --> 01:04:41,357
(She laughs once and focuses on her food.)

1863
01:04:41,358 --> 01:04:42,488
Hold on.

1864
01:04:43,258 --> 01:04:44,258
I'm so excited.

1865
01:04:45,658 --> 01:04:47,698
(Moaning)

1866
01:04:48,028 --> 01:04:49,998
(Blowing on it)

1867
01:04:54,968 --> 01:04:56,367
- The noodles are good.
- Yes.

1868
01:04:56,368 --> 01:04:57,707
(The Daejeon local is proud.)

1869
01:04:57,708 --> 01:04:59,107
- It's really good.
- Yes.

1870
01:04:59,108 --> 01:05:01,437
(Haewon, the big eater, tries a bite.)

1871
01:05:01,438 --> 01:05:03,037
Yeon Shik, you can't handle spicy, so you shouldn't eat this.

1872
01:05:03,038 --> 01:05:04,438
(She ends up picking up the plate.)

1873
01:05:05,978 --> 01:05:07,408
- It's good.
- I know, right?

1874
01:05:08,148 --> 01:05:09,317
(SULLYOON missed the taste of her hometown.)

1875
01:05:09,318 --> 01:05:10,478
It's good.

1876
01:05:12,818 --> 01:05:14,988
Why don't I try it with the noodles?

1877
01:05:15,288 --> 01:05:19,758
(Putting the webfoot octopus on top of kalguksu)

1878
01:05:24,028 --> 01:05:25,028
With the webfoot octopus?

1879
01:05:25,029 --> 01:05:26,629
(Jae Suk already has them ready to eat.)

1880
01:05:32,368 --> 01:05:33,467
- You have to eat them together.
- Yes.

1881
01:05:33,468 --> 01:05:34,537
(That's a good combo.)

1882
01:05:34,538 --> 01:05:36,477
It goes really well with kalguksu.

1883
01:05:36,478 --> 01:05:38,198
It goes perfectly with the webfoot octopus.

1884
01:05:38,308 --> 01:05:39,507
That was a good meal.

1885
01:05:39,508 --> 01:05:41,177
(They finished their lunch in no time.)

1886
01:05:41,178 --> 01:05:42,348
How should we pay?

1887
01:05:42,818 --> 01:05:45,048
- Pay for the food?
- But...

1888
01:05:45,988 --> 01:05:47,918
I'm sorry to do this to these girls.

1889
01:05:48,058 --> 01:05:49,817
Okay. I'll take the check.

1890
01:05:49,818 --> 01:05:50,927
(It's on Jae Suk today!)

1891
01:05:50,928 --> 01:05:52,788
- Thank you.
- Thanks for the food.

1892
01:05:52,928 --> 01:05:53,928
Let's get going.

1893
01:05:54,228 --> 01:05:56,498
Here, Yeon Shik. Hold this for me.

1894
01:05:58,098 --> 01:05:59,127
Jae Suk.

1895
01:05:59,128 --> 01:06:00,267
(Today's lunch sponsor gets treated well.)

1896
01:06:00,268 --> 01:06:02,137
- CEO.
- I'm paying for lunch, so...

1897
01:06:02,138 --> 01:06:04,368
- You are.
- Thanks.

1898
01:06:05,508 --> 01:06:07,708
(Help me put on my jacket too.)

1899
01:06:08,178 --> 01:06:10,907
(They help each other out.)

1900
01:06:10,908 --> 01:06:12,807
- We're supposed to help out.
- Thank you.

1901
01:06:12,808 --> 01:06:14,288
- Yes, we help each other out.
- Yes.

1902
01:06:14,448 --> 01:06:15,548
Thank you.

1903
01:06:16,148 --> 01:06:17,248
Thank you for the food.

1904
01:06:17,918 --> 01:06:19,648
Thank you. This feels great.

1905
01:06:19,848 --> 01:06:21,388
Now that my belly is warm...

1906
01:06:21,588 --> 01:06:22,588
It feels good.

1907
01:06:22,589 --> 01:06:23,757
- Thanks for the food.
- Don't mention it.

1908
01:06:23,758 --> 01:06:25,387
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

1909
01:06:25,388 --> 01:06:26,557
- Man.
- Thank you so much.

1910
01:06:26,558 --> 01:06:28,428
- No problem.
- Thank you.

1911
01:06:28,558 --> 01:06:29,928
Thanks to SULLYOON...

1912
01:06:30,158 --> 01:06:31,197
- It was so good.
- I enjoyed it.

1913
01:06:31,198 --> 01:06:33,068
I really enjoyed the kalguksu.

1914
01:06:33,668 --> 01:06:34,748
I got to try it in the end.

1915
01:06:34,968 --> 01:06:36,138
From Kim Ji Eun.

1916
01:06:36,268 --> 01:06:38,037
"I'm a high school senior..."

1917
01:06:38,038 --> 01:06:39,807
"who just finished the Mara-level CSAT."

1918
01:06:39,808 --> 01:06:41,138
- Okay.
- No way.

1919
01:06:41,538 --> 01:06:42,538
The CSAT can be tough.

1920
01:06:43,038 --> 01:06:44,407
It can be pretty tough.

1921
01:06:44,408 --> 01:06:46,048
I heard it was almost lava-level.

1922
01:06:47,178 --> 01:06:48,178
"These days are..."

1923
01:06:48,179 --> 01:06:50,147
- "the sweetest moments of my life."
- Indeed.

1924
01:06:50,148 --> 01:06:51,947
- It must be nice.
- "I finally got my nails done..."

1925
01:06:51,948 --> 01:06:54,047
"and even received my first-ever paycheck."

1926
01:06:54,048 --> 01:06:55,257
Really?

1927
01:06:55,258 --> 01:06:57,587
"I'd love for you to join me in saying goodbye..."

1928
01:06:57,588 --> 01:07:00,427
- "to the end of my 19th year."
- Sure.

1929
01:07:00,428 --> 01:07:02,868
"I'll be waiting for you at the cafe in front of the school."

1930
01:07:02,898 --> 01:07:04,097
A cafe?

1931
01:07:04,098 --> 01:07:05,698
- At a cafe?
- A cafe.

1932
01:07:05,968 --> 01:07:07,838
- "Currently, and still, happy."
- Here it is.

1933
01:07:08,038 --> 01:07:09,897
- That's cute.
- That's adorable.

1934
01:07:09,898 --> 01:07:11,607
(They arrived 15 minutes early.)

1935
01:07:11,608 --> 01:07:13,007
Hello.

1936
01:07:13,008 --> 01:07:14,707
- We'll order our drinks first.
- Hello.

1937
01:07:14,708 --> 01:07:16,638
- Good afternoon.
- A special...

1938
01:07:17,748 --> 01:07:19,548
I'm so nervous all of a sudden.

1939
01:07:19,778 --> 01:07:21,078
Is my makeup too thick?

1940
01:07:21,448 --> 01:07:22,748
- No.
- No.

1941
01:07:22,848 --> 01:07:24,687
- You look perfect under the sun.
- It's perfect.

1942
01:07:24,688 --> 01:07:25,747
You look beautiful right now.

1943
01:07:25,748 --> 01:07:28,057
Okay. We're the most beautiful girls in the world.

1944
01:07:28,058 --> 01:07:29,188
Let's not look.

1945
01:07:30,658 --> 01:07:31,828
- What?
- What?

1946
01:07:32,458 --> 01:07:34,428
- My goodness.
- Hello.

1947
01:07:34,528 --> 01:07:35,608
- Ji Eun.
- Are you Ji Eun?

1948
01:07:35,798 --> 01:07:39,528
(Kim Ji Eun, third Whenever Guest)

1949
01:07:39,728 --> 01:07:41,197
- Ji Eun?
- Who's Ji Eun?

1950
01:07:41,198 --> 01:07:42,237
Hello.

1951
01:07:42,238 --> 01:07:44,038
- Let's move.
- Let's move to a bigger table.

1952
01:07:44,138 --> 01:07:45,368
Let's go over there.

1953
01:07:45,838 --> 01:07:46,938
(My goodness)

1954
01:07:47,438 --> 01:07:48,708
(My goodness)

1955
01:07:49,738 --> 01:07:50,778
It's NMIXX.

1956
01:07:51,248 --> 01:07:52,308
We're in trouble.

1957
01:07:53,178 --> 01:07:55,078
Ji Eun and friends,

1958
01:07:55,548 --> 01:07:56,647
where are you coming from?

1959
01:07:56,648 --> 01:07:59,347
- We came here after school.
- School.

1960
01:07:59,348 --> 01:08:02,258
- Now, you're done with CSAT.
- Yes.

1961
01:08:02,818 --> 01:08:05,588
Congratulations on being done with CSAT.

1962
01:08:05,758 --> 01:08:06,858
Well done.

1963
01:08:07,958 --> 01:08:10,498
- It must've been stressful.
- I know.

1964
01:08:10,728 --> 01:08:12,628
Did you get a good result?

1965
01:08:12,728 --> 01:08:14,028
(A straightforward question)

1966
01:08:14,338 --> 01:08:15,637
I got the score I needed.

1967
01:08:15,638 --> 01:08:17,168
- That's perfect.
- Totally.

1968
01:08:17,668 --> 01:08:20,538
It's good if you got the score you needed.

1969
01:08:20,938 --> 01:08:22,307
What's your name?

1970
01:08:22,308 --> 01:08:23,537
- Ji Min.
- Ji Min.

1971
01:08:23,538 --> 01:08:24,577
- Yu Jin.
- Yu Jin.

1972
01:08:24,578 --> 01:08:26,077
- Na El.
- Na El.

1973
01:08:26,078 --> 01:08:27,377
(Lee Yu Jin, Lee Ji Min, Lee Na El, Kim Ji Eun)

1974
01:08:27,378 --> 01:08:28,817
Are the four of you best friends?

1975
01:08:28,818 --> 01:08:30,578
Yes, we're the closest in our homeroom.

1976
01:08:31,788 --> 01:08:34,558
You're at the age to decide on a group name.

1977
01:08:35,558 --> 01:08:36,588
Beauties.

1978
01:08:36,918 --> 01:08:38,028
DG Beauties.

1979
01:08:38,388 --> 01:08:39,757
- What beauties?
- DG Beauties.

1980
01:08:39,758 --> 01:08:41,674
- Daejeon Girls' High School.
- Daejeon Girls' High School.

1981
01:08:41,698 --> 01:08:42,827
- Girls' High School.
- Daejeon Girls' High School.

1982
01:08:42,828 --> 01:08:44,567
- DG Beauties.
- DG Beauties.

1983
01:08:44,568 --> 01:08:46,827
It isn't official, right? You guys came up with the name.

1984
01:08:46,828 --> 01:08:48,738
- You could say that.
- That's right.

1985
01:08:49,268 --> 01:08:50,738
- That's right.
- How cute!

1986
01:08:51,468 --> 01:08:55,908
(The daily life of DG Beauties after CSAT)

1987
01:08:56,078 --> 01:08:57,407
(Whether they are in...)

1988
01:08:57,408 --> 01:08:58,578
(or out of school, )

1989
01:08:58,778 --> 01:09:00,808
(they hang out together.)

1990
01:09:01,148 --> 01:09:03,448
- SULLYOON is from Daejeon.
- That's right.

1991
01:09:03,618 --> 01:09:04,717
- That's right.
- I knew that.

1992
01:09:04,718 --> 01:09:05,847
- Did you know that?
- You knew that.

1993
01:09:05,848 --> 01:09:08,218
- She's a specialty of Daejeon.
- Thank you.

1994
01:09:09,018 --> 01:09:11,558
Since the weather was quite cold,

1995
01:09:11,758 --> 01:09:14,057
we had kalguksu at Daejeon Station.

1996
01:09:14,058 --> 01:09:17,028
Why is kalguksu so famous in Daejeon?

1997
01:09:17,628 --> 01:09:18,727
- It's because of flour.
- She knows the reason very well.

1998
01:09:18,728 --> 01:09:19,927
- Flour entered through here.
- Yes.

1999
01:09:19,928 --> 01:09:23,598
During the Three White Industries, the US brought in flour.

2000
01:09:23,798 --> 01:09:26,407
Since Daejeon was the center of transportation,

2001
01:09:26,408 --> 01:09:29,737
flour became the staple for the locals.

2002
01:09:29,738 --> 01:09:31,808
- Thus, bread and noodle dishes...
- That's right.

2003
01:09:32,148 --> 01:09:34,207
- They used a lot of flour.
- Yes.

2004
01:09:34,208 --> 01:09:36,247
They're young indeed.

2005
01:09:36,248 --> 01:09:37,347
Seriously.

2006
01:09:37,348 --> 01:09:38,817
(DG Beauties' choice, strawberry lattes enter.)

2007
01:09:38,818 --> 01:09:39,917
They're young indeed.

2008
01:09:39,918 --> 01:09:42,058
- Thank you. It looks tasty.
- Thank you.

2009
01:09:42,218 --> 01:09:44,188
I often had such drinks back in my school days.

2010
01:09:44,658 --> 01:09:48,728
How did you apply for Whenever Possible?

2011
01:09:48,798 --> 01:09:50,198
I'm the homeroom president.

2012
01:09:50,358 --> 01:09:52,667
- Are you the homeroom president?
- Yes, I'm the homeroom president.

2013
01:09:52,668 --> 01:09:54,867
I was so busy with the CSAT preparations...

2014
01:09:54,868 --> 01:09:57,637
that I couldn't hang out with my friends often.

2015
01:09:57,638 --> 01:10:00,067
- We only talked about colleges.
- Right.

2016
01:10:00,068 --> 01:10:01,578
I felt bad about that.

2017
01:10:01,708 --> 01:10:03,407
And one friend is moving to a different region.

2018
01:10:03,408 --> 01:10:06,447
- Which one is it?
- I'm moving to Daegu.

2019
01:10:06,448 --> 01:10:08,147
- You're moving to Daegu.
- Yes.

2020
01:10:08,148 --> 01:10:10,228
- Oh, no. You could be a bit sad.
- You must be sad.

2021
01:10:10,418 --> 01:10:13,387
- I'm sad about leaving my friends.
- Seriously.

2022
01:10:13,388 --> 01:10:14,587
Come to Daejeon often.

2023
01:10:14,588 --> 01:10:15,657
I'll come often.

2024
01:10:15,658 --> 01:10:18,157
- Come often.
- Daegu and Daejeon aren't...

2025
01:10:18,158 --> 01:10:19,827
- very far.
- It's only a short train ride.

2026
01:10:19,828 --> 01:10:22,727
- That's right.
- You'll make new friends in Daegu.

2027
01:10:22,728 --> 01:10:23,797
Thank you.

2028
01:10:23,798 --> 01:10:25,727
(Logic bloomed amidst the girls' sentimentality.)

2029
01:10:25,728 --> 01:10:27,048
Maybe I shouldn't have said that.

2030
01:10:28,368 --> 01:10:29,538
- I...
- Are you a thinker?

2031
01:10:29,668 --> 01:10:31,367
- I was too...
- While you weren't wrong...

2032
01:10:31,368 --> 01:10:33,837
Although she has her best friends here,

2033
01:10:33,838 --> 01:10:35,508
- she'll do well in Daegu.
- Okay.

2034
01:10:36,538 --> 01:10:39,077
- It's nothing to be sad about.
- Jae Suk had to write letters.

2035
01:10:39,078 --> 01:10:41,278
That's right. You could write letters.

2036
01:10:41,518 --> 01:10:42,748
- Postcards.
- Yes.

2037
01:10:42,918 --> 01:10:44,518
- What's this?
- Pigeon post.

2038
01:10:45,448 --> 01:10:46,618
He isn't that old.

2039
01:10:47,318 --> 01:10:49,217
- We had corded phones.
- Beacon.

2040
01:10:49,218 --> 01:10:51,688
- We had corded phones.
- "It's an emergency."

2041
01:10:52,458 --> 01:10:54,227
- We had corded phones.
- Okay.

2042
01:10:54,228 --> 01:10:56,227
Did a telephone operator process your call?

2043
01:10:56,228 --> 01:10:57,298
It was like that...

2044
01:10:58,028 --> 01:11:00,298
- in a generation before mine.
- A telephone operator.

2045
01:11:00,868 --> 01:11:04,138
- That happened in the 60s and 70s.
- Really?

2046
01:11:04,338 --> 01:11:05,437
It was a previous generation.

2047
01:11:05,438 --> 01:11:06,958
(A modern history lesson from Jae Suk)

2048
01:11:07,208 --> 01:11:09,937
I heard that you were born in 1984.

2049
01:11:09,938 --> 01:11:12,148
- Yes.
- My dad was born in 1982.

2050
01:11:13,948 --> 01:11:16,247
- So...
- Suddenly... Na El.

2051
01:11:16,248 --> 01:11:18,318
- I mean...
- My goodness.

2052
01:11:18,448 --> 01:11:19,718
- That's scary.
- Hold on.

2053
01:11:19,848 --> 01:11:22,218
- They're about the same age.
- It's understandable.

2054
01:11:22,788 --> 01:11:25,458
- It's understandable.
- Yeon Shik isn't a young man.

2055
01:11:25,758 --> 01:11:27,487
Your dad must've gotten married at a young age.

2056
01:11:27,488 --> 01:11:28,557
You're right.

2057
01:11:28,558 --> 01:11:31,158
My dad worked hard to make money for his kids' baby formula.

2058
01:11:32,468 --> 01:11:33,468
Hold on.

2059
01:11:33,469 --> 01:11:36,138
- Yeon Seok doesn't do that yet.
- Not yet.

2060
01:11:36,568 --> 01:11:38,867
- He works hard for his own food.
- That's right.

2061
01:11:38,868 --> 01:11:41,238
- His own food.
- I need to provide for my dog.

2062
01:11:41,508 --> 01:11:43,378
- Right.
- You're so handsome.

2063
01:11:44,948 --> 01:11:46,147
How about your dad?

2064
01:11:46,148 --> 01:11:47,948
My dad is a middle-aged man with a big belly.

2065
01:11:48,948 --> 01:11:50,048
Oh, no.

2066
01:11:50,748 --> 01:11:52,687
Still, he's the coolest person to me.

2067
01:11:52,688 --> 01:11:54,247
- That's right.
- Yes.

2068
01:11:54,248 --> 01:11:56,257
(It's time to do the mission.)

2069
01:11:56,258 --> 01:11:59,127
Let's see what the Round One present is.

2070
01:11:59,128 --> 01:12:01,297
Ji Eun, please choose one and break it open.

2071
01:12:01,298 --> 01:12:03,138
I can't believe I'm seeing these in real life.

2072
01:12:03,558 --> 01:12:04,628
How cute!

2073
01:12:04,968 --> 01:12:06,567
"When you go in here, one hour passes in a blur."

2074
01:12:06,568 --> 01:12:08,197
"It's the place girls visit every day."

2075
01:12:08,198 --> 01:12:10,167
"A 300-dollar gift card for Olive Young."

2076
01:12:10,168 --> 01:12:11,737
(A 300-dollar gift card for Olive Young)

2077
01:12:11,738 --> 01:12:13,168
I want that as well.

2078
01:12:13,638 --> 01:12:15,277
People love that place these days.

2079
01:12:15,278 --> 01:12:17,237
- Olive Young is all the rage.
- Yes.

2080
01:12:17,238 --> 01:12:18,524
- Three hundred dollars.
- Hold on.

2081
01:12:18,548 --> 01:12:19,908
- Goodness.
- Hold on.

2082
01:12:20,048 --> 01:12:22,318
- How cute.
- We need to succeed in the game.

2083
01:12:22,448 --> 01:12:24,277
- We need to succeed in it.
- We'll succeed in it.

2084
01:12:24,278 --> 01:12:25,417
- We'll succeed in it.
- What?

2085
01:12:25,418 --> 01:12:26,517
I want to steal it.

2086
01:12:26,518 --> 01:12:27,547
You want to steal it.

2087
01:12:27,548 --> 01:12:29,287
- I mean...
- You want to do many things.

2088
01:12:29,288 --> 01:12:30,457
- Steal it.
- You want to steal it.

2089
01:12:30,458 --> 01:12:31,487
Steal it.

2090
01:12:31,488 --> 01:12:32,827
(A mission for the Olive Young gift card)

2091
01:12:32,828 --> 01:12:34,828
(Goodbye, High School!)

2092
01:12:34,928 --> 01:12:36,427
(Round 1)

2093
01:12:36,428 --> 01:12:39,928
(Flick the student IDs and flip all 4 of them.)

2094
01:12:40,568 --> 01:12:42,368
What? How do we flip them?

2095
01:12:42,998 --> 01:12:45,037
- Like this?
- Like this.

2096
01:12:45,038 --> 01:12:46,238
Do we do it like ddakji?

2097
01:12:47,068 --> 01:12:48,637
I think we can do this one.

2098
01:12:48,638 --> 01:12:49,837
- Yes.
- We can do it.

2099
01:12:49,838 --> 01:12:51,647
- We have our IDs.
- They'll give their student IDs.

2100
01:12:51,648 --> 01:12:53,047
- Ji Eun and her friends'...
- One each?

2101
01:12:53,048 --> 01:12:54,107
- student IDs?
- Take one each.

2102
01:12:54,108 --> 01:12:55,177
- One each?
- Yes.

2103
01:12:55,178 --> 01:12:56,648
All right. Thank you.

2104
01:12:56,948 --> 01:12:58,048
How cute!

2105
01:12:58,548 --> 01:13:00,848
- These are student IDs.
- So...

2106
01:13:01,888 --> 01:13:03,618
So we put it over the edge...

2107
01:13:04,258 --> 01:13:05,328
and flick it.

2108
01:13:07,858 --> 01:13:09,098
- It worked.
- It worked.

2109
01:13:10,728 --> 01:13:12,597
- It worked.
- It worked. We got this.

2110
01:13:12,598 --> 01:13:14,398
- I think we'll succeed in it.
- We got this.

2111
01:13:14,868 --> 01:13:16,798
- We got this.
- But all four of us...

2112
01:13:17,168 --> 01:13:18,648
All four of us need to succeed in it.

2113
01:13:19,238 --> 01:13:21,238
Gently. Okay. I got this.

2114
01:13:21,378 --> 01:13:22,738
Don't you need to do it like this?

2115
01:13:22,938 --> 01:13:24,354
- Yes.
- Shall I do it horizontally?

2116
01:13:24,378 --> 01:13:25,578
You just need to flick gently.

2117
01:13:26,348 --> 01:13:27,707
(All 4 of them succeed in it during practice.)

2118
01:13:27,708 --> 01:13:28,917
- They're good.
- Yes.

2119
01:13:28,918 --> 01:13:30,077
- We're set. Okay.
- Okay.

2120
01:13:30,078 --> 01:13:31,887
- All right.
- Here we go! Let's go right away.

2121
01:13:31,888 --> 01:13:34,117
We got my kind of game today.

2122
01:13:34,118 --> 01:13:35,587
- All right.
- Let's do a cheer together.

2123
01:13:35,588 --> 01:13:37,718
- Let's do a cheer together.
- Gather around.

2124
01:13:38,188 --> 01:13:40,187
- In 1, 2, 3.
- In 1, 2, 3.

2125
01:13:40,188 --> 01:13:41,527
- Let's go!
- Let's go! Okay.

2126
01:13:41,528 --> 01:13:43,098
- We got this.
- Round One.

2127
01:13:43,628 --> 01:13:44,668
It's the first try.

2128
01:13:45,128 --> 01:13:46,627
- Go ahead. Good.
- I'll go first.

2129
01:13:46,628 --> 01:13:48,148
- Let's go in this order.
- Good luck.

2130
01:13:48,798 --> 01:13:49,798
Here I go!

2131
01:13:49,799 --> 01:13:51,197
(1st try, Yeon Seok)

2132
01:13:51,198 --> 01:13:52,208
(Chuckling)

2133
01:13:52,368 --> 01:13:54,137
- It's nerve-racking.
- It's easy, but...

2134
01:13:54,138 --> 01:13:55,407
- Why is it so nerve-racking?
- It's easy.

2135
01:13:55,408 --> 01:13:57,238
- It's very easy.
- No way.

2136
01:13:57,908 --> 01:14:00,008
- Don't pressure them.
- Okay.

2137
01:14:00,208 --> 01:14:01,377
- Okay. Here I go.
- Don't pressure them.

2138
01:14:01,378 --> 01:14:02,947
- I just need to do it gently.
- Flick it gently.

2139
01:14:02,948 --> 01:14:05,308
I just need to do it gently. There's no need to do it hard.

2140
01:14:06,888 --> 01:14:08,987
(1st try, Yeon Seok)

2141
01:14:08,988 --> 01:14:10,018
You failed.

2142
01:14:11,458 --> 01:14:12,528
You failed.

2143
01:14:14,898 --> 01:14:15,958
You failed.

2144
01:14:18,268 --> 01:14:19,298
What?

2145
01:14:20,598 --> 01:14:21,668
What?

2146
01:14:22,098 --> 01:14:23,268
Many tries remain.

2147
01:14:24,238 --> 01:14:25,837
- I flicked it too hard.
- One more time.

2148
01:14:25,838 --> 01:14:27,437
Let's have another try right away.

2149
01:14:27,438 --> 01:14:29,008
Right away.

2150
01:14:29,108 --> 01:14:30,384
- My heart is beating so fast.
- All right.

2151
01:14:30,408 --> 01:14:32,447
- Don't put your guards down.
- In 1, 2, 3.

2152
01:14:32,448 --> 01:14:33,528
- Here we go!
- Here we go!

2153
01:14:34,108 --> 01:14:35,117
(2nd try, Yeon Seok)

2154
01:14:35,118 --> 01:14:37,417
I just need to do it gently.

2155
01:14:37,418 --> 01:14:40,018
(2nd try, Yeon Seok)

2156
01:14:41,288 --> 01:14:42,457
(He's finally relieved.)

2157
01:14:42,458 --> 01:14:43,518
Oh, my.

2158
01:14:44,188 --> 01:14:45,228
Did you go already?

2159
01:14:46,758 --> 01:14:48,897
(She goes for it right away.)

2160
01:14:48,898 --> 01:14:50,028
Oh, my.

2161
01:14:50,558 --> 01:14:52,297
- Did you go already?
- Yes, she went just now.

2162
01:14:52,298 --> 01:14:53,618
(Reading the room, feeling sorry)

2163
01:14:54,838 --> 01:14:56,237
It's hard...

2164
01:14:56,238 --> 01:14:58,408
- for all four of us to do it.
- Let's practice.

2165
01:14:58,638 --> 01:14:59,737
- This is why it's hard.
- It's hard.

2166
01:14:59,738 --> 01:15:01,478
Although you can do it...

2167
01:15:02,978 --> 01:15:04,478
- I'm so nervous.
- Seriously.

2168
01:15:05,008 --> 01:15:07,008
- I'm so nervous.
- Your hands are shaking.

2169
01:15:07,508 --> 01:15:09,394
- Her hands are shaking.
- It's so nerve-racking.

2170
01:15:09,418 --> 01:15:11,547
- You can do it.
- All right. Don't be nervous.

2171
01:15:11,548 --> 01:15:13,164
- We need to succeed in Round One.
- Let's go.

2172
01:15:13,188 --> 01:15:14,247
- Go it gently.
- All right.

2173
01:15:14,248 --> 01:15:15,658
- We're in trouble.
- This is...

2174
01:15:16,688 --> 01:15:18,758
- Right now, the girls...
- They're incredulous.

2175
01:15:19,358 --> 01:15:20,728
The girls' faces fell.

2176
01:15:20,888 --> 01:15:22,404
- It's nothing.
- Olive Young is important.

2177
01:15:22,428 --> 01:15:24,028
- Olive Young is important.
- All right.

2178
01:15:24,258 --> 01:15:25,727
(Meanwhile, )

2179
01:15:25,728 --> 01:15:27,067
(Haewon can't hear anything.)

2180
01:15:27,068 --> 01:15:28,237
- Let's just go.
- Good luck.

2181
01:15:28,238 --> 01:15:29,898
- In 1, 2, 3. Here we go!
- Here we go!

2182
01:15:30,398 --> 01:15:32,037
All right. I'll go first.

2183
01:15:32,038 --> 01:15:33,508
This is driving me crazy.

2184
01:15:34,108 --> 01:15:35,308
- I'll go first.
- Okay.

2185
01:15:35,608 --> 01:15:37,208
We got my kind of game today.

2186
01:15:44,278 --> 01:15:45,287
(Failed)

2187
01:15:45,288 --> 01:15:47,348
Seriously, it's like this!

2188
01:15:47,448 --> 01:15:49,288
It's like this, Jae Suk!

2189
01:15:49,718 --> 01:15:50,788
- It's...
- Hold on.

2190
01:15:51,118 --> 01:15:52,128
- It's...
- Hold on.

2191
01:15:52,458 --> 01:15:54,627
- It's hard for all of us to do it.
- I know. It's impossible.

2192
01:15:54,628 --> 01:15:56,728
- Let's use the bonus coupon.
- Let's use it.

2193
01:15:56,828 --> 01:15:58,467
- Let's use it.
- Let's do that.

2194
01:15:58,468 --> 01:15:59,597
- A bonus coupon.
- We'll use it.

2195
01:15:59,598 --> 01:16:01,537
- One member needs to sit out.
- That's right.

2196
01:16:01,538 --> 01:16:03,297
- Who will it be?
- Stare at the member...

2197
01:16:03,298 --> 01:16:05,068
you want to replace.

2198
01:16:06,338 --> 01:16:07,408
It's confusing.

2199
01:16:08,778 --> 01:16:09,838
I'm sorry.

2200
01:16:10,578 --> 01:16:12,507
I'm sorry.

2201
01:16:12,508 --> 01:16:13,777
- It's okay.
- Let's go.

2202
01:16:13,778 --> 01:16:15,147
- My heart is at ease.
- Let's go.

2203
01:16:15,148 --> 01:16:16,617
- I love it.
- I'm sorry.

2204
01:16:16,618 --> 01:16:17,848
This is better.

2205
01:16:18,318 --> 01:16:20,718
- May I practice?
- Go ahead.

2206
01:16:22,388 --> 01:16:23,458
Don't flick it hard.

2207
01:16:23,718 --> 01:16:25,628
Flick it gently so that it over flips once.

2208
01:16:27,258 --> 01:16:30,028
- Make it a bit gentler.
- I'm sorry.

2209
01:16:30,128 --> 01:16:31,334
- A bit gentler.
- He's an instructor.

2210
01:16:31,358 --> 01:16:32,928
He has become an instructor.

2211
01:16:33,328 --> 01:16:35,067
That's right. So that you don't miss,

2212
01:16:35,068 --> 01:16:36,538
send it directly up.

2213
01:16:38,538 --> 01:16:39,708
There you go.

2214
01:16:40,268 --> 01:16:41,678
- I got it. Hold on.
- Let's go.

2215
01:16:42,208 --> 01:16:43,377
- That's it.
- Hold on.

2216
01:16:43,378 --> 01:16:44,848
- That's how you flick it.
- Okay.

2217
01:16:45,848 --> 01:16:47,448
While it's nothing...

2218
01:16:47,808 --> 01:16:48,978
- It's...
- Good luck.

2219
01:16:50,048 --> 01:16:51,917
- Hold on.
- Good luck.

2220
01:16:51,918 --> 01:16:53,187
- Let's go.
- In 1, 2, 3.

2221
01:16:53,188 --> 01:16:54,218
- Let's go!
- Let's go!

2222
01:16:54,788 --> 01:16:56,187
Are you ready? Say, "Here I go!"

2223
01:16:56,188 --> 01:16:57,257
Here I go!

2224
01:16:57,258 --> 01:16:58,258
(Bonus Coupon Round)

2225
01:16:58,528 --> 01:16:59,958
We need to do this.

2226
01:17:01,928 --> 01:17:03,288
- Please.
- Do it with confidence.

2227
01:17:03,998 --> 01:17:04,998
- Goodness.
- Ji Eun! Homeroom president!

2228
01:17:04,998 --> 01:17:05,998
- How cute.
- Do it with confidence.

2229
01:17:05,999 --> 01:17:07,719
- Homeroom president.
- Show us your power.

2230
01:17:09,468 --> 01:17:11,967
(Bonus coupon try, Ji Eun)

2231
01:17:11,968 --> 01:17:13,337
(Success)

2232
01:17:13,338 --> 01:17:14,438
I'm so anxious.

2233
01:17:15,178 --> 01:17:17,408
(The 1st ID card is flipped.)

2234
01:17:18,108 --> 01:17:20,107
Hold on. I'm so anxious.

2235
01:17:20,108 --> 01:17:21,208
I'll do it as I practiced.

2236
01:17:22,018 --> 01:17:23,247
(Now comes the instructor.)

2237
01:17:23,248 --> 01:17:24,347
I'll do it as I practiced.

2238
01:17:24,348 --> 01:17:25,648
I'll flick it gently.

2239
01:17:27,388 --> 01:17:28,958
(I believe in you!)

2240
01:17:30,958 --> 01:17:32,158
You failed.

2241
01:17:32,558 --> 01:17:33,688
Hold on.

2242
01:17:33,758 --> 01:17:34,758
You failed.

2243
01:17:34,759 --> 01:17:35,798
(Failed)

2244
01:17:36,228 --> 01:17:37,827
(The bonus coupon try is over.)

2245
01:17:37,828 --> 01:17:38,928
- Hold on.
- This is...

2246
01:17:39,568 --> 01:17:40,767
(She hurriedly goes back to practice.)

2247
01:17:40,768 --> 01:17:41,797
It's hard.

2248
01:17:41,798 --> 01:17:42,997
(Mr. Yoo?)

2249
01:17:42,998 --> 01:17:44,937
- I don't even want Round Two.
- I'm usually good at this.

2250
01:17:44,938 --> 01:17:46,507
What was the point of giving her a lesson?

2251
01:17:46,508 --> 01:17:48,067
- I don't even want Round Two.
- I know.

2252
01:17:48,068 --> 01:17:49,777
- I just want Round 1.
- The 300-dollar gift card.

2253
01:17:49,778 --> 01:17:51,678
- This is...
- We need to get Olive Young.

2254
01:17:51,878 --> 01:17:53,754
I know. We need to get the 300-dollar gift card.

2255
01:17:53,778 --> 01:17:54,918
(Wary)

2256
01:17:55,148 --> 01:17:57,278
- Do it very gently.
- Even when you do well...

2257
01:17:57,918 --> 01:17:59,817
- Ji Eun, please go back.
- Okay.

2258
01:17:59,818 --> 01:18:01,088
- Thank you.
- Okay.

2259
01:18:01,218 --> 01:18:03,688
- Haewon.
- I'll go back to my position.

2260
01:18:03,888 --> 01:18:05,758
- Ji Eun did well.
- Seriously.

2261
01:18:06,988 --> 01:18:07,988
All right.

2262
01:18:09,458 --> 01:18:10,458
Let's go.

2263
01:18:10,898 --> 01:18:11,997
Hold on.

2264
01:18:11,998 --> 01:18:13,627
- It isn't that hard.
- He suddenly feels hot.

2265
01:18:13,628 --> 01:18:16,298
- Hold on.
- We must get past Round One.

2266
01:18:16,938 --> 01:18:18,568
My goodness.

2267
01:18:19,238 --> 01:18:20,468
- I mean...
- Good.

2268
01:18:22,538 --> 01:18:24,507
All of you can do it. Gently.

2269
01:18:24,508 --> 01:18:26,407
- There's no reason to struggle.
- Gently.

2270
01:18:26,408 --> 01:18:28,177
- Right now, - I can't do it.

2271
01:18:28,178 --> 01:18:29,418
I'm succeeding in every time.

2272
01:18:29,548 --> 01:18:31,377
- Hold on.
- I'm succeeding in every time.

2273
01:18:31,378 --> 01:18:33,147
- Do you want to go 1st?
- I'll go 1st.

2274
01:18:33,148 --> 01:18:34,487
- Go first.
- Let's go!

2275
01:18:34,488 --> 01:18:36,517
- Let's go!
- In 1, 2, 3.

2276
01:18:36,518 --> 01:18:38,328
- Here we go!
- It's the fifth try.

2277
01:18:38,558 --> 01:18:39,687
The fifth try.

2278
01:18:39,688 --> 01:18:42,228
(Jae Suk's success rate was 95 percent during practice.)

2279
01:18:45,328 --> 01:18:47,627
(5th try, Jae Suk)

2280
01:18:47,628 --> 01:18:49,398
(Success)

2281
01:18:50,338 --> 01:18:52,168
(SULLYOON is next.)

2282
01:18:54,408 --> 01:18:55,438
You failed.

2283
01:18:55,538 --> 01:18:56,638
I'm so sorry.

2284
01:18:57,238 --> 01:18:59,478
Why... Why can't I do it?

2285
01:19:01,148 --> 01:19:03,847
(Meanwhile, Haewon succeeds in it.)

2286
01:19:03,848 --> 01:19:05,248
(Yeon Seok also succeeds in it.)

2287
01:19:05,518 --> 01:19:06,587
(Had SULLYOON succeeded in it)

2288
01:19:06,588 --> 01:19:09,388
Seriously. Come on!

2289
01:19:09,858 --> 01:19:10,918
Are you kidding me?

2290
01:19:11,788 --> 01:19:12,788
Come on!

2291
01:19:13,488 --> 01:19:15,098
It's so hard.

2292
01:19:15,128 --> 01:19:17,658
- We struggle when we meet students.
- I did it.

2293
01:19:18,158 --> 01:19:19,227
I did it.

2294
01:19:19,228 --> 01:19:21,298
(It's a show that destroys teenagers' innocence.)

2295
01:19:21,398 --> 01:19:23,298
- This is...
- My goodness.

2296
01:19:24,238 --> 01:19:25,537
Good luck.

2297
01:19:25,538 --> 01:19:28,107
- You know, it's so easy.
- Olive Young!

2298
01:19:28,108 --> 01:19:29,777
- Let's go!
- Let's go!

2299
01:19:29,778 --> 01:19:30,937
Olive Young!

2300
01:19:30,938 --> 01:19:33,008
We need to help them go to Olive Young...

2301
01:19:33,308 --> 01:19:34,608
- at the very least.
- I mean...

2302
01:19:34,778 --> 01:19:36,577
- I feel bad.
- Where did the two coupons go?

2303
01:19:36,578 --> 01:19:38,847
I'm traumatized.

2304
01:19:38,848 --> 01:19:40,264
- You're traumatized?
- I'm traumatized.

2305
01:19:40,288 --> 01:19:41,718
- Haewon.
- You can do it.

2306
01:19:41,918 --> 01:19:43,278
SULLYOON, do you want to go first?

2307
01:19:44,058 --> 01:19:45,128
Okay.

2308
01:19:47,158 --> 01:19:48,158
SULLYOON.

2309
01:19:48,598 --> 01:19:52,327
- Please. All right.
- Let's do this.

2310
01:19:52,328 --> 01:19:53,827
- Let's bring our energy together.
- Let's do that.

2311
01:19:53,828 --> 01:19:55,197
In 1, 2, 3.

2312
01:19:55,198 --> 01:19:56,238
- Let's go!
- Let's go!

2313
01:19:56,598 --> 01:19:58,367
- SULLYOON, don't go just yet.
- Okay.

2314
01:19:58,368 --> 01:19:59,468
Say, "Here I go!"

2315
01:19:59,638 --> 01:20:00,707
Here I go!

2316
01:20:00,708 --> 01:20:02,007
(Out of 10 total tries, they're on try number 7.)

2317
01:20:02,008 --> 01:20:04,838
I don't even want Round 2. I just want Round 1.

2318
01:20:06,648 --> 01:20:07,648
Here I go!

2319
01:20:07,948 --> 01:20:09,217
Good.

2320
01:20:09,218 --> 01:20:11,317
(7th try, SULLYOON)

2321
01:20:11,318 --> 01:20:13,548
(7th try, Jae Suk)

2322
01:20:15,588 --> 01:20:17,088
(Failed)

2323
01:20:19,658 --> 01:20:20,887
(He hangs his head.)

2324
01:20:20,888 --> 01:20:22,328
This is driving me crazy.

2325
01:20:23,698 --> 01:20:25,297
(What's going on?)

2326
01:20:25,298 --> 01:20:26,628
This is driving me crazy.

2327
01:20:27,198 --> 01:20:29,438
(It's definitely an easy game.)

2328
01:20:30,098 --> 01:20:31,738
(So why can't they succeed in it?)

2329
01:20:32,138 --> 01:20:33,808
(She gets a reality check.)

2330
01:20:34,138 --> 01:20:35,478
This is driving me crazy.

2331
01:20:37,108 --> 01:20:39,377
(Shocked and horrified)

2332
01:20:39,378 --> 01:20:41,308
Why did it make a complete turn?

2333
01:20:41,448 --> 01:20:42,618
It's okay.

2334
01:20:43,148 --> 01:20:44,778
We need to succeed in it by now.

2335
01:20:44,948 --> 01:20:47,147
The last try is hard because we get more nervous.

2336
01:20:47,148 --> 01:20:50,287
- That won't do.
- Would you have a discussion...

2337
01:20:50,288 --> 01:20:52,008
- and decide on the order?
- The ninth try.

2338
01:20:52,728 --> 01:20:53,857
Please do that.

2339
01:20:53,858 --> 01:20:55,257
What should we do?

2340
01:20:55,258 --> 01:20:57,128
(They begin to have a homeroom meeting.)

2341
01:20:57,228 --> 01:20:58,427
- And...
- Jae Suk's skills...

2342
01:20:58,428 --> 01:20:59,967
- fluctuate.
- Maybe last.

2343
01:20:59,968 --> 01:21:01,698
- Third? Fourth?
- Fourth.

2344
01:21:01,998 --> 01:21:03,697
You should come up a bit.

2345
01:21:03,698 --> 01:21:05,667
If you flick it from below, it'll fall.

2346
01:21:05,668 --> 01:21:06,837
(Practicing diligently)

2347
01:21:06,838 --> 01:21:08,638
That's better. That's right.

2348
01:21:09,178 --> 01:21:10,507
That's right. That's perfect.

2349
01:21:10,508 --> 01:21:13,008
(Haewon keeps her mouth shut and focuses on practicing.)

2350
01:21:13,308 --> 01:21:15,278
- This is...
- Hold on. The pressure...

2351
01:21:15,618 --> 01:21:18,648
I thought we'd succeed in it by the fourth try.

2352
01:21:18,688 --> 01:21:20,387
Let's have SULLYOON go 1st and switch the 2.

2353
01:21:20,388 --> 01:21:21,388
- Okay.
- Okay.

2354
01:21:21,988 --> 01:21:23,757
- We've decided.
- Okay.

2355
01:21:23,758 --> 01:21:25,787
- SULLYOON is first.
- Okay.

2356
01:21:25,788 --> 01:21:27,887
- Yes. Jae Suk is 2nd.
- I'm 2nd.

2357
01:21:27,888 --> 01:21:29,627
- Haewon is 3rd, Yeon Seok is 4th.
- Haewon is 3rd, Yeon Seok is 4th.

2358
01:21:29,628 --> 01:21:30,857
- That sounds good.
- Okay.

2359
01:21:30,858 --> 01:21:32,167
- One, two, three, four.
- Two tries remain.

2360
01:21:32,168 --> 01:21:34,827
- Two tries remain. Let's go!
- Let's go!

2361
01:21:34,828 --> 01:21:36,368
- Let's go.
- Okay.

2362
01:21:36,538 --> 01:21:38,537
SULLYOON, say, "Here I go!"

2363
01:21:38,538 --> 01:21:39,538
Here I go!

2364
01:21:39,539 --> 01:21:41,237
(Out of 10 total tries, they're on try number 9.)

2365
01:21:41,238 --> 01:21:43,778
We need to succeed in it this time to eliminate the pressure.

2366
01:21:46,148 --> 01:21:47,207
Here I go!

2367
01:21:47,208 --> 01:21:48,377
(9th try, SULLYOON)

2368
01:21:48,378 --> 01:21:49,548
- Jae Suk.
- Okay.

2369
01:21:50,178 --> 01:21:53,818
(9th try, Jae Suk)

2370
01:21:53,848 --> 01:21:55,558
(Jae Suk succeeds in it.)

2371
01:21:56,218 --> 01:21:58,887
(For the 1st time ever, the 2nd player succeeds in it.)

2372
01:21:58,888 --> 01:22:00,427
(The third player, )

2373
01:22:00,428 --> 01:22:01,828
(Haewon)

2374
01:22:03,498 --> 01:22:04,628
You failed.

2375
01:22:06,168 --> 01:22:07,827
(Failed)

2376
01:22:07,828 --> 01:22:10,238
It's okay. You can do it.

2377
01:22:10,938 --> 01:22:13,238
- Can I sit out?
- No.

2378
01:22:13,338 --> 01:22:15,737
- You can't sit out.
- You can do it. You can overcome.

2379
01:22:15,738 --> 01:22:17,477
- In that case...
- I don't think I can do it.

2380
01:22:17,478 --> 01:22:18,747
(Shouting)

2381
01:22:18,748 --> 01:22:19,848
Do you want to go last?

2382
01:22:20,408 --> 01:22:22,617
- Let's go in this order.
- Okay.

2383
01:22:22,618 --> 01:22:24,677
- Go last and taste success.
- Haewon, go last.

2384
01:22:24,678 --> 01:22:25,787
- Okay.
- Yes.

2385
01:22:25,788 --> 01:22:27,017
- You can do it.
- It's the last try.

2386
01:22:27,018 --> 01:22:29,088
Only one try remains. We're sorry.

2387
01:22:29,558 --> 01:22:31,087
We'll do our best.

2388
01:22:31,088 --> 01:22:33,087
- Let's go!
- Let's go!

2389
01:22:33,088 --> 01:22:34,887
- I'll turn over a new leaf.
- Let's go!

2390
01:22:34,888 --> 01:22:36,498
Let me practice.

2391
01:22:36,598 --> 01:22:37,797
- It's the last try.
- Check one last time.

2392
01:22:37,798 --> 01:22:38,798
In 1, 2, 3.

2393
01:22:38,799 --> 01:22:40,297
- Here we go!
- Here we go!

2394
01:22:40,298 --> 01:22:41,997
(Out of 10 total tries, they're on the last try.)

2395
01:22:41,998 --> 01:22:43,998
- It's the last try.
- Hold on.

2396
01:22:44,198 --> 01:22:45,208
Here I go.

2397
01:22:48,368 --> 01:22:52,578
(It's the last chance to taste success.)

2398
01:22:54,808 --> 01:22:55,878
Here I go.

2399
01:22:56,018 --> 01:22:57,448
(Last try, SULLYOON)

2400
01:22:58,065 --> 01:22:59,195
I won't look.

2401
01:23:00,795 --> 01:23:02,395
- I won't look.
- I won't look.

2402
01:23:03,395 --> 01:23:05,465
Jae Suk, do it as you've practiced.

2403
01:23:10,975 --> 01:23:13,174
(Last try, Jae Suk)

2404
01:23:13,175 --> 01:23:15,515
(They failed the mission.)

2405
01:23:17,445 --> 01:23:18,445
You failed.

2406
01:23:19,145 --> 01:23:20,885
(She spots it belatedly.)

2407
01:23:27,795 --> 01:23:28,924
Did we get no prize?

2408
01:23:28,925 --> 01:23:29,954
(She can't believe it.)

2409
01:23:29,955 --> 01:23:31,965
(The prize gets taken away quickly.)

2410
01:23:35,435 --> 01:23:36,594
I can't believe we failed.

2411
01:23:36,595 --> 01:23:37,765
Is it over?

2412
01:23:39,005 --> 01:23:41,205
- It's over.
- Is it over?

2413
01:23:41,335 --> 01:23:42,404
I'll stay like this.

2414
01:23:42,405 --> 01:23:44,505
Why did it turn one more time?

2415
01:23:46,305 --> 01:23:48,245
I'm so sorry.

2416
01:23:48,445 --> 01:23:49,914
I'm on my knees.

2417
01:23:49,915 --> 01:23:51,915
- It's okay.
- It's okay.

2418
01:23:57,515 --> 01:23:58,625
It's too bad.

2419
01:24:00,155 --> 01:24:01,424
(Merchandise)

2420
01:24:01,425 --> 01:24:02,625
Two more.

2421
01:24:02,795 --> 01:24:04,295
This is great.

2422
01:24:04,325 --> 01:24:05,364
My goodness.

2423
01:24:05,365 --> 01:24:07,101
- The merchandise is more rare.
- Thank you.

2424
01:24:07,125 --> 01:24:08,564
- It's better than 300 dollars.
- That's right.

2425
01:24:08,565 --> 01:24:10,664
- Thank you.
- She's the homeroom president.

2426
01:24:10,665 --> 01:24:13,305
I really wanted to give you guys an Olive Young gift card.

2427
01:24:13,965 --> 01:24:14,975
I'm sorry.

2428
01:24:15,005 --> 01:24:17,435
We gained something more precious than 300 dollars.

2429
01:24:18,805 --> 01:24:20,904
- We're happy.
- We made precious memories.

2430
01:24:20,905 --> 01:24:22,615
You can't buy this with money.

2431
01:24:23,215 --> 01:24:24,815
- It's okay.
- Okay.

2432
01:24:26,185 --> 01:24:28,815
(They become solemn.)

2433
01:24:29,455 --> 01:24:30,615
I hope...

2434
01:24:31,485 --> 01:24:33,654
- your friendship doesn't change.
- Okay.

2435
01:24:33,655 --> 01:24:36,655
- Make good memories at college.
- That's right.

2436
01:24:36,825 --> 01:24:38,965
You called us here to make good memories.

2437
01:24:39,295 --> 01:24:40,395
We're really sorry.

2438
01:24:41,165 --> 01:24:42,234
We can still go to Olive Young.

2439
01:24:42,235 --> 01:24:44,164
- We can do it.
- We can work part-time.

2440
01:24:44,165 --> 01:24:47,234
- Why was it so hard?
- Thank you.

2441
01:24:47,235 --> 01:24:49,905
- It drove me crazy.
- Seriously.

2442
01:24:50,675 --> 01:24:51,804
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

2443
01:24:51,805 --> 01:24:53,805
- We're sorry.
- It's okay.

2444
01:24:53,875 --> 01:24:54,974
You hurt your hand.

2445
01:24:54,975 --> 01:24:56,374
- It's okay.
- We should've succeeded in it.

2446
01:24:56,375 --> 01:24:57,445
Thank you.

2447
01:24:57,915 --> 01:24:59,814
(Whenever Friend, Lee Sun Bin)

2448
01:24:59,815 --> 01:25:01,414
(Everyone has a younger friend like that, Jae Suk.)

2449
01:25:01,415 --> 01:25:02,514
(A younger friend you worry about.)

2450
01:25:02,515 --> 01:25:04,925
(He's like what Kwang Soo is to me!)

2451
01:25:05,125 --> 01:25:07,084
(You look like a sickly king.)

2452
01:25:07,085 --> 01:25:09,655
(Sickly king, Kim Young Dae)

2453
01:25:10,055 --> 01:25:11,864
(Are you the type to get nervous?)

2454
01:25:11,865 --> 01:25:13,425
(Not when I play games.)

2455
01:25:13,465 --> 01:25:15,494
(The older members become excited.)

2456
01:25:15,495 --> 01:25:18,034
(I'll... Good... I mean, )

2457
01:25:18,035 --> 01:25:19,035
(I'll nail it.)

2458
01:25:19,405 --> 01:25:20,535
Do well.

2459
01:25:21,235 --> 01:25:24,674
(He lacks the core strength.)

2460
01:25:24,675 --> 01:25:26,905
(She lacks the aim.)

2461
01:25:27,305 --> 01:25:30,415
(These Whenever Friends are clumsy in some ways.)

2462
01:25:30,875 --> 01:25:32,615
(We shouldn't be like this.)

2463
01:25:32,815 --> 01:25:34,144
(Jae Suk, you need to do it!)

2464
01:25:34,145 --> 01:25:35,854
(Is Jae Suk the only one they can depend on?)

2465
01:25:35,855 --> 01:25:36,984
(Jae Suk is on fire today!)

2466
01:25:36,985 --> 01:25:38,325
(He has good energy.)

2467
01:25:38,725 --> 01:25:41,625
(Thanks to the hosts who are on fire for the first time in a while, )

2468
01:25:41,655 --> 01:25:43,555
(they'll seize the day.)

2469
01:25:43,625 --> 01:25:47,525
(Whenever Possible, January 27 at 9pm)
