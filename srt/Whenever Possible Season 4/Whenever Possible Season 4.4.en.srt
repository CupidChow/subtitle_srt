00:00:09,790 --> 00:00:11,930
(Today's spare time, Nonhyeon)

3
00:00:12,730 --> 00:00:14,530
(Slurping)

4
00:00:16,170 --> 00:00:18,040
- This latte tastes great. - My gosh.

5
00:00:18,770 --> 00:00:19,940
You'd better be good to me.

6
00:00:20,840 --> 00:00:22,510
- I'm the face of SBS. - Why?

7
00:00:24,410 --> 00:00:25,740
- Right. - Yes.

8
00:00:26,010 --> 00:00:27,749
- Congratulations. - I won the Face of SBS Award.

9
00:00:27,750 --> 00:00:29,380
(Face of the SBS Award Chosen by AI)

10
00:00:31,680 --> 00:00:33,949
(AI identified the face that appeared on SBS the longest.)

11
00:00:33,950 --> 00:00:36,320
(A total airtime of 981 minutes and 24 seconds for 1 year)

12
00:00:36,390 --> 00:00:37,520
(It's Yoo Jae Suk.)

13
00:00:37,790 --> 00:00:38,819
Congratulations.

14
00:00:38,820 --> 00:00:40,529
(Smiling brightly)

15
00:00:40,530 --> 00:00:41,530
Thank you.

16
00:00:41,830 --> 00:00:44,360
Do I get a special benefit with this award?

17
00:00:44,560 --> 00:00:47,230
SBS gave out meal tickets last year or two years ago.

18
00:00:47,370 --> 00:00:50,070
No. There's no benefit since you're too ugly to represent SBS.

19
00:00:50,570 --> 00:00:52,416
You wouldn't have been chosen if people determined the winner.

20
00:00:52,440 --> 00:00:54,316
(Tae Hyun irritated him whenever and wherever he could.)

21
00:00:54,340 --> 00:00:56,710
Why are you taking a close-up shot of me?

22
00:00:57,310 --> 00:00:58,380
You know what?

23
00:00:58,880 --> 00:01:01,850
I didn't know SBS was represented by a face like yours.

24
00:01:02,810 --> 00:01:03,880
- What? - I mean...

25
00:01:04,180 --> 00:01:06,779
- By a face like yours? - I had no idea.

26
00:01:06,780 --> 00:01:09,389
I'm the face of SBS for a year.

27
00:01:09,390 --> 00:01:10,520
You'd better know that.

28
00:01:11,390 --> 00:01:12,390
I'm the face of SBS for a year.

29
00:01:12,391 --> 00:01:13,606
(He's the face of SBS for 1 year.)

30
00:01:13,630 --> 00:01:15,159
- We also won the Best Couple Award. - The Best Couple Award.

31
00:01:15,160 --> 00:01:17,160
(Yoo-Yoo Chemistry won the Best Couple Award.)

32
00:01:17,260 --> 00:01:19,460
- You know, I was only interested... - Congratulations.

33
00:01:19,500 --> 00:01:21,199
- in winning the Best Couple Award. - Congratulations.

34
00:01:21,200 --> 00:01:22,299
- Really? - Yes.

35
00:01:22,300 --> 00:01:23,430
I'm serious.

36
00:01:23,840 --> 00:01:25,316
- What did you say? - You guys make a good couple.

37
00:01:25,340 --> 00:01:26,440
What do you mean?

38
00:01:26,870 --> 00:01:28,140
He's an Ahn.

39
00:01:28,310 --> 00:01:29,630
(His real name is Ahn Yeon Seok.)

40
00:01:29,740 --> 00:01:31,109
- He's an Ahn. - Come on.

41
00:01:31,110 --> 00:01:32,439
We won the Best Couple Award...

42
00:01:32,440 --> 00:01:33,879
- with Yoo-Yoo Chemistry. - So...

43
00:01:33,880 --> 00:01:35,009
- you are... - Come on.

44
00:01:35,010 --> 00:01:36,350
Choosing...

45
00:01:36,780 --> 00:01:38,020
Your stylist is running away.

46
00:01:39,480 --> 00:01:43,019
She looks so happy running away now that she's done with her job.

47
00:01:43,020 --> 00:01:44,860
- "I'm free." - She's... Right.

48
00:01:45,220 --> 00:01:47,089
"I'm free. I'm done with my job today."

49
00:01:47,090 --> 00:01:48,859
She can leave once we start rolling.

50
00:01:48,860 --> 00:01:49,989
She can leave.

51
00:01:49,990 --> 00:01:52,159
- When we film outdoors, - Yes.

52
00:01:52,160 --> 00:01:54,229
- we go to different places. - Right.

53
00:01:54,230 --> 00:01:57,439
There are two different groups. The indoor and outdoor groups.

54
00:01:57,440 --> 00:01:59,039
You mostly film outdoors.

55
00:01:59,040 --> 00:02:00,239
- I mostly film outdoors. - Right?

56
00:02:00,240 --> 00:02:02,269
You can think of me as a traveling peddler.

57
00:02:02,270 --> 00:02:03,810
(A traveling peddler)

58
00:02:03,880 --> 00:02:05,940
- I go to places with my pouch. - Right.

59
00:02:06,110 --> 00:02:08,950
- I visit different neighborhoods. - Yes.

60
00:02:09,050 --> 00:02:10,519
I'm like a traveling peddler.

61
00:02:10,520 --> 00:02:13,149
Dong Yeob is known to film shows mostly indoors.

62
00:02:13,150 --> 00:02:14,989
- He mostly films indoors. - I see.

63
00:02:14,990 --> 00:02:16,189
The Centaur Group.

64
00:02:16,190 --> 00:02:17,289
(The Centaur Group)

65
00:02:17,290 --> 00:02:18,290
- Why? - Okay.

66
00:02:18,291 --> 00:02:19,690
You can only see his upper body.

67
00:02:21,160 --> 00:02:24,460
- Anyway, I met one of the guests... - Yes.

68
00:02:24,630 --> 00:02:26,600
On a different program.

69
00:02:26,760 --> 00:02:27,999
- He already started... - Yes.

70
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:29,169
Promoting the movie.

71
00:02:29,170 --> 00:02:30,599
- That's right. - I see.

72
00:02:30,600 --> 00:02:31,799
- It's called "Heartman." - Yes.

73
00:02:31,800 --> 00:02:33,299
- "Heartman." - Yes.

74
00:02:33,300 --> 00:02:34,709
He's a funny guy, to begin with.

75
00:02:34,710 --> 00:02:36,170
- Really? - Yes.

76
00:02:36,470 --> 00:02:37,779
As for his co-star,

77
00:02:37,780 --> 00:02:39,709
I filmed a movie with her a long time ago.

78
00:02:39,710 --> 00:02:41,050
- Really? - Yes.

79
00:02:41,350 --> 00:02:43,380
We filmed the movie together...

80
00:02:43,880 --> 00:02:46,079
- Has it been a long time? - almost ten years ago.

81
00:02:46,080 --> 00:02:47,389
- It's been a decade. Yes. - Really?

82
00:02:47,390 --> 00:02:50,389
The last time I saw her was on "Running Man."

83
00:02:50,390 --> 00:02:51,760
Or "Happy Together."

84
00:02:52,990 --> 00:02:54,630
I haven't felt this cold in a while.

85
00:02:55,690 --> 00:02:57,900
- Where? This must be the place. - Yes.

86
00:02:59,330 --> 00:03:00,929
- It's a step above. - Yes. It's a step above.

87
00:03:00,930 --> 00:03:02,206
(Whenever Friends hurry inside.)

88
00:03:02,230 --> 00:03:04,239
- It's been about a decade. - I can hear their footsteps.

89
00:03:04,240 --> 00:03:05,740
- I can hear their footsteps. - Yes.

90
00:03:05,870 --> 00:03:07,369
- Go up? - And turn right.

91
00:03:07,370 --> 00:03:08,439
- Right here. - You're here.

92
00:03:08,440 --> 00:03:09,469
- Chae Won. - Hello.

93
00:03:09,470 --> 00:03:10,709
- Hello. - My gosh.

94
00:03:10,710 --> 00:03:12,779

It's been a while.

My gosh. How long has it been?

121
00:04:05,030 --> 00:04:06,599
It's almost been a decade.

122
00:04:06,600 --> 00:04:07,829

- Isn't it cold? - It's quite cold today.

129
00:04:16,210 --> 00:04:17,880
- It's no joke. - Right.

130
00:04:18,380 --> 00:04:20,710
- I don't think we've met. - Oh, us?

131
00:04:20,750 --> 00:04:22,379
- He has never met Sang Woo before. - Really?

132
00:04:22,380 --> 00:04:24,080
- Yes. - So...

133
00:04:24,220 --> 00:04:26,649
- we only said hello in passing. - We only said hello.

134
00:04:26,650 --> 00:04:28,826
- But we never worked together. - You never worked together.

135
00:04:28,850 --> 00:04:31,420
- It's been so long, Chae Won. - Yes.

136
00:04:31,490 --> 00:04:33,059
- I last saw you on "Running Man." - The last time we met on TV...

137
00:04:33,060 --> 00:04:34,789
- was on "Running Man." - I see.

138
00:04:34,790 --> 00:04:36,129
You and Yeon Seok...

139
00:04:36,130 --> 00:04:37,459
We filmed the movie after "Running Man."

140
00:04:37,460 --> 00:04:38,559
- It was after "Running Man." - Yes.

141
00:04:38,560 --> 00:04:39,799
It's called "Mood of the Day."

142
00:04:39,800 --> 00:04:42,699
- It premiered in early 2016. - Around...

143
00:04:42,700 --> 00:04:45,070
So it's almost been ten years since we last saw each other.

144
00:04:45,240 --> 00:04:47,109
- Sang Woo... - You guys never met afterward?

145
00:04:47,110 --> 00:04:48,509
- Afterward... - We didn't have any occasions.

146
00:04:48,510 --> 00:04:50,239
We... Right.

147
00:04:50,240 --> 00:04:51,310
So they're not close.

148
00:04:53,610 --> 00:04:55,609
But the thing is,

149
00:04:55,610 --> 00:04:57,720
- She's startled. - when you don't work together...

150
00:04:57,920 --> 00:04:59,150
She's startled.

151
00:04:59,320 --> 00:05:01,119
Chae Won's eyes got so big.

152
00:05:01,120 --> 00:05:02,520
I didn't know how to react.

153
00:05:03,450 --> 00:05:04,959
When you don't work together in a project,

154
00:05:04,960 --> 00:05:06,589
- it's hard to meet your colleagues. - That's right.

155
00:05:06,590 --> 00:05:08,559
- You know? - A few days ago, I met him...

156
00:05:08,560 --> 00:05:10,429
"You Quiz on the Block" after a long while.

157
00:05:10,430 --> 00:05:12,799
- As I told you before, he's funny. - Right.

158
00:05:12,800 --> 00:05:15,399
Back then, he mostly played romantic characters.

159
00:05:15,400 --> 00:05:17,539
So he had to hold himself back.

160
00:05:17,540 --> 00:05:19,499
But now, nothing is stopping him.

161
00:05:19,500 --> 00:05:21,210
I'm 50 years old now.

162
00:05:21,610 --> 00:05:23,910
- Already? - Yes. I'm 50. I was born in 1976.

163
00:05:24,340 --> 00:05:25,609
- You're 50? - Yes.

164
00:05:25,610 --> 00:05:27,749
Gosh, you're half a century old now.

165
00:05:27,750 --> 00:05:30,310
I'm not embarrassed about my age at all.

166
00:05:31,250 --> 00:05:32,250
(Crying)

167
00:05:32,251 --> 00:05:34,650
(The half-a-century-old guy is sobbing.)

168
00:05:34,750 --> 00:05:36,496
How long has it been since you two last met?

169
00:05:36,520 --> 00:05:39,519
Meeting Sang Woo on a show like this...

170
00:05:39,520 --> 00:05:41,160
- Again, we're not close either. - I see.

171
00:05:41,830 --> 00:05:42,929
- It's all the same. - I saw him...

172
00:05:42,930 --> 00:05:43,999
on "Running Man" a decade ago.

173
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:45,706
We met on "You Quiz on the Block" a few days ago.

174
00:05:45,730 --> 00:05:47,869
The thing about Jae Suk is that...

175
00:05:47,870 --> 00:05:49,299
he has work every day.

176
00:05:49,300 --> 00:05:52,140
It's iffy to contact him even if I were close to him.

177
00:05:52,240 --> 00:05:53,270
It's an excuse.

178
00:05:54,870 --> 00:05:55,970
We're not close.

179
00:05:57,980 --> 00:06:01,179
By the way, Sang Woo and Chae Won are on our show...

180
00:06:01,180 --> 00:06:03,949
to promote their movie, "Heartman." When will it premiere?

181
00:06:03,950 --> 00:06:05,319
It will premiere on January 14.

182
00:06:05,320 --> 00:06:07,049
- It will come out soon. - January 14.

183
00:06:07,050 --> 00:06:08,350
Is it a romantic comedy?

184
00:06:08,690 --> 00:06:11,189
It's much more entertaining than a regular romantic comedy.

185
00:06:11,190 --> 00:06:12,219
It's more comedy-forward?

186
00:06:12,220 --> 00:06:14,566
- Yes, it's more comedy-forward. - It's more comedy-forward.

187
00:06:14,590 --> 00:06:17,700
(The New Year's romantic comedy with Sang Woo and Chae Won)

188
00:06:18,800 --> 00:06:23,200
(His first love appears in front of him again.)

189
00:06:23,630 --> 00:06:25,569
("Heartman")

190
00:06:25,570 --> 00:06:27,609
(It's a comedy movie about a divorced man.)

191
00:06:27,610 --> 00:06:29,890
(Seung Min's struggle to win over his first love, Bo Na.)

192
00:06:30,170 --> 00:06:33,240
(A guaranteed hit, Sang Woo's new comedy movie)

193
00:06:34,280 --> 00:06:36,309
- It's "Heartman," not "Hitman." - "Heartman."

194
00:06:36,310 --> 00:06:37,670
The two movies are very different.

195
00:06:37,850 --> 00:06:39,149
But isn't it the same director?

196
00:06:39,150 --> 00:06:40,649
- It's the same director. - Right.

197
00:06:40,650 --> 00:06:41,996
- It's the same director. - I see.

198
00:06:42,020 --> 00:06:43,620
I can proudly say this.

199
00:06:44,090 --> 00:06:45,359
Chae Won looks...

200
00:06:45,360 --> 00:06:47,329
the most beautiful in this movie of everything she's ever been in.

201
00:06:47,330 --> 00:06:50,389
- He keeps saying that. - I see.

202
00:06:50,390 --> 00:06:51,629
- I mean it. - Really?

203
00:06:51,630 --> 00:06:53,130
What about Sang Woo?

204
00:06:53,300 --> 00:06:54,729
Did he look his best in the movie?

205
00:06:54,730 --> 00:06:57,670
He always looks his best.

206
00:06:57,870 --> 00:06:59,470
- He's always late? - No.

207
00:06:59,940 --> 00:07:02,209
- "He was always late." - He was late?

208
00:07:02,210 --> 00:07:03,469
He was late?

209
00:07:03,470 --> 00:07:05,510
- Always... No. - Were you often late to the shoot?

210
00:07:05,580 --> 00:07:06,580
(Getting playful)

211
00:07:06,581 --> 00:07:07,609
Why were you always late?

212
00:07:07,610 --> 00:07:09,010
- I always got there... - Sang Woo.

213
00:07:09,310 --> 00:07:10,849
Two hours before the shoot.

214
00:07:10,850 --> 00:07:11,950
I see.

215
00:07:12,820 --> 00:07:14,120
He always looks his best.

216
00:07:14,220 --> 00:07:16,950
- His acting was so passionate. - Right.

217
00:07:17,320 --> 00:07:19,619
Seriously. You were serious about promoting the movie.

218
00:07:19,620 --> 00:07:20,959
- Right. - Well...

219
00:07:20,960 --> 00:07:23,090
- He even kneeled in the theater. - Yes.

220
00:07:23,490 --> 00:07:24,700
- I was desperate. - Right.

221
00:07:25,530 --> 00:07:27,370
The movie industry is struggling.

222
00:07:27,470 --> 00:07:28,930
- I was desperate. - Seriously.

223
00:07:29,070 --> 00:07:31,369
- It's not just the movie industry. - Yes.

224
00:07:31,370 --> 00:07:34,509
Even the TV industry is struggling. Everyone is so desperate.

225
00:07:34,510 --> 00:07:35,569
- Really? - But not you.

226
00:07:35,570 --> 00:07:36,639
Yes, I am.

227
00:07:36,640 --> 00:07:37,839
You're the face of the SBS.

228
00:07:37,840 --> 00:07:39,080
- No. By the way, - Come on.

229
00:07:39,240 --> 00:07:41,050
I won the Face of the SBS Award.

230
00:07:41,410 --> 00:07:44,220
Regardless of how SBS thinks about it,

231
00:07:44,350 --> 00:07:46,780
I'll be telling people I'm the face of SBS for a year.

232
00:07:47,120 --> 00:07:49,249
- My gosh. This award... - We should congratulate you.

233
00:07:49,250 --> 00:07:51,760
Officially declared that it's Jae Suk's world now.

234
00:07:52,160 --> 00:07:53,220
Hey.

235
00:07:53,390 --> 00:07:55,190
He doesn't even know what the award is about.

236
00:07:55,430 --> 00:07:58,400
He always runs his mouth, not knowing what he's talking about.

237
00:07:58,460 --> 00:07:59,530
He drives me crazy.

238
00:07:59,700 --> 00:08:01,629
- You know what? We should make... - Nothing?

239
00:08:01,630 --> 00:08:04,340
- a bust sculpture for him. - Hey.

240
00:08:04,440 --> 00:08:06,769
- I'm serious. - Who makes busts these days?

241
00:08:06,770 --> 00:08:08,909
- Gosh, you're so frustrating. - Let's make it fancy.

242
00:08:08,910 --> 00:08:11,340
- It should be a bronze sculpture. - With bronze.

243
00:08:11,410 --> 00:08:13,509
People will rub a part of the sculpture,

244
00:08:13,510 --> 00:08:14,910
and it will shine.

245
00:08:15,510 --> 00:08:17,349
- You have a way with words. - You little...

246
00:08:17,350 --> 00:08:19,919
- People can rub your mouth. - Right here.

247
00:08:19,920 --> 00:08:21,219
You think it will be the mouth, right?

248
00:08:21,220 --> 00:08:22,950
But people usually rub the nose.

249
00:08:23,690 --> 00:08:25,020
Then they'd give birth to sons.

250
00:08:27,060 --> 00:08:28,630
Be quiet.

251
00:08:29,190 --> 00:08:30,590
- Come on. - Let's make one.

252
00:08:30,660 --> 00:08:33,300
- Sang Woo. He's irritating me. - It's different.

253
00:08:33,970 --> 00:08:37,339
First, it was Tae Hyun. Now, he's irritating me too.

254
00:08:37,340 --> 00:08:38,669
He was also born in 1976.

255
00:08:38,670 --> 00:08:40,840
Gosh. People born in 1976 don't mix well with me.

256
00:08:40,970 --> 00:08:43,270
- They are good at irritating you. - People born in 1976.

257
00:08:43,370 --> 00:08:44,909
- Yes, those guys are irritating. - That's it.

258
00:08:44,910 --> 00:08:46,340
You're right.

259
00:08:47,140 --> 00:08:48,749
Let's check where we're headed.

260
00:08:48,750 --> 00:08:50,249
- It's about time. - I see.

261
00:08:50,250 --> 00:08:52,050
- Where we're headed? - Okay, Face of SBS.

262
00:08:52,880 --> 00:08:55,350
- Okay. The first Whenever Guest. - "Naz."

263
00:08:55,420 --> 00:08:56,919
- "Naz." - What?

264
00:08:56,920 --> 00:08:57,959
- What a unique name. - "Naz."

265
00:08:57,960 --> 00:08:58,989
- "Naz?" - Yes.

266
00:08:58,990 --> 00:09:00,929
- "Naz." - Is it a foreigner?

267
00:09:00,930 --> 00:09:02,460
- I think so. - I see.

268
00:09:02,560 --> 00:09:04,359
"After watching 'Full House, '"

269
00:09:04,360 --> 00:09:05,759
"I came to Korea without a clear plan..."

270
00:09:05,760 --> 00:09:07,236
- "nine years ago." - Yes, it's a foreigner.

271
00:09:07,260 --> 00:09:10,500
"I used to watch Korean dramas only as a viewer."

272
00:09:10,630 --> 00:09:13,600
"But now, I get to add a bit of my own touch to the dramas."

273
00:09:13,740 --> 00:09:15,939
"I'm a full-time worker with four major insurance benefits."

274
00:09:15,940 --> 00:09:17,480
Really?

275
00:09:17,610 --> 00:09:19,640
"My dream is about to begin."

276
00:09:19,780 --> 00:09:22,110
"I'd love your support for my next scene."

277
00:09:23,110 --> 00:09:25,479
So she watched a Korean drama,

278
00:09:25,480 --> 00:09:27,520
became interested in Korea, and moved here.

279
00:09:27,720 --> 00:09:30,049
- Now, she put down roots here. - Yes.

280
00:09:30,050 --> 00:09:32,419
- I think she's a foreigner. - That's impressive.

281
00:09:32,420 --> 00:09:34,660
(Today's Whenever Guest is a K-drama lover from abroad?)

282
00:09:34,990 --> 00:09:36,990
- Hold on. - I wonder what her job is.

283
00:09:37,260 --> 00:09:40,329
- On foot... - You guys look like newlyweds.

284
00:09:40,330 --> 00:09:42,769
- It's their outfits. - Their outfits look similar too.

285
00:09:42,770 --> 00:09:43,899
- They are similar. - So...

286
00:09:43,900 --> 00:09:46,176
- We're checking the card together. - You're checking it together.

287
00:09:46,200 --> 00:09:48,839
- You look like newlyweds. - We were a couple in the movie.

288
00:09:48,840 --> 00:09:51,110
- Right. You two make a good couple. - Yes. We were.

289
00:09:51,210 --> 00:09:53,510
- It was a long time ago, though. - Yes.

290
00:09:53,810 --> 00:09:54,956
- It was a long time ago. - Right.

291
00:09:54,980 --> 00:09:57,050
We filmed our own "Heartman" a long time ago.

292
00:09:57,680 --> 00:10:00,150
It takes 15 minutes on foot. It takes 12 minutes via bus.

293
00:10:00,650 --> 00:10:01,949
- We should walk. - It takes 15 minutes on foot.

294
00:10:01,950 --> 00:10:03,649
- We should get going now. - We should go.

295
00:10:03,650 --> 00:10:05,260
- I see. Now? - We should go out now.

296
00:10:05,420 --> 00:10:07,929
You know what? It's chilly outside.

297
00:10:07,930 --> 00:10:08,959
Yes, it's perfect.

298
00:10:08,960 --> 00:10:10,230
Are you okay with cold weather?

299
00:10:10,760 --> 00:10:11,930
I loathe it.

300
00:10:12,330 --> 00:10:13,730
Then why did you say you were okay?

301
00:10:14,070 --> 00:10:16,029
It's nice to come out once in a while.

302
00:10:16,030 --> 00:10:17,369
- It wakes me up. - It's so hard to film...

303
00:10:17,370 --> 00:10:18,699
when it's cold outside.

304
00:10:18,700 --> 00:10:20,246
- Especially at dawn. - It'd be freezing.

305
00:10:20,270 --> 00:10:23,040
We're lucky it's not windy today. Imagine if it were.

306
00:10:23,740 --> 00:10:26,340
- Right. - It must be so tough to film...

307
00:10:26,780 --> 00:10:28,580
the first scene at dawn in this weather.

308
00:10:28,680 --> 00:10:30,880
But mentally, I'm happy to be around my house.

309
00:10:31,080 --> 00:10:33,160
Have you lived in this neighborhood for a long time?

310
00:10:33,420 --> 00:10:34,750
It's been about nine years.

311
00:10:35,050 --> 00:10:36,290
- Really? - That's a long time.

312
00:10:37,090 --> 00:10:39,466
- You've been here a long time. - Yes, I've been here a long time.

313
00:10:39,490 --> 00:10:41,930
Filming in winter is brutal.

314
00:10:42,060 --> 00:10:43,689
- But I'm happy. - Yes.

315
00:10:43,690 --> 00:10:44,829
We couldn't have met you...

316
00:10:44,830 --> 00:10:45,929
- if not for this show. - When...

317
00:10:45,930 --> 00:10:47,670
- would we have the chance? - Totally.

318
00:10:48,200 --> 00:10:49,970
- I always wanted to meet you. - Same here.

319
00:10:50,100 --> 00:10:53,000
I don't get that many chances to meet junior actors.

320
00:10:53,170 --> 00:10:56,869
I get to meet a lot of actors and actresses through the show...

321
00:10:56,870 --> 00:10:57,939
even when we don't work together.

322
00:10:57,940 --> 00:10:59,079
- Right. - I really like that.

323
00:10:59,080 --> 00:11:00,439
I went to the SBS Drama Awards.

324
00:11:00,440 --> 00:11:02,680
- So many of them promoted... - They were on your show?

325
00:11:02,910 --> 00:11:04,050
Their dramas on our show.

326
00:11:04,250 --> 00:11:06,780
Lee Jun Hyuk, Han Ji Min,

327
00:11:07,050 --> 00:11:09,720
and the cast from "Taxi Driver."

328
00:11:09,890 --> 00:11:11,559
- Je Hoon. - Je Hoon.

329
00:11:11,560 --> 00:11:12,859
He won the Grand Award.

330
00:11:12,860 --> 00:11:14,730
- Yes. - He won the Grand Award.

331
00:11:14,830 --> 00:11:15,989
I should text him to congratulate him.

332
00:11:15,990 --> 00:11:17,906
My gosh. I was happy to see them at the ceremony.

333
00:11:17,930 --> 00:11:20,900
Sang Woo, you've won the Grand Award at the Drama Awards, right?

334
00:11:21,230 --> 00:11:22,369
No, not the Grand Award.

335
00:11:22,370 --> 00:11:24,440
- Really? - Yes.

336
00:11:24,600 --> 00:11:26,669
- I won the Top Excellence Award. - I just assumed that you did.

337
00:11:26,670 --> 00:11:29,439
- I won the Top Excellence Award. - What a surprise. You didn't win...

338
00:11:29,440 --> 00:11:31,440
- the Grand Award. Right. - I assumed that he did.

339
00:11:31,940 --> 00:11:33,880
My gosh, it's freezing!

340
00:11:35,080 --> 00:11:36,110
It's cold.

341
00:11:36,810 --> 00:11:37,850
I'm sorry.

342
00:11:38,050 --> 00:11:39,979
- You startled her. - I'm sorry.

343
00:11:39,980 --> 00:11:41,749
Happy New Year. Gosh, I feel awful.

344
00:11:41,750 --> 00:11:43,019
Oh, it's this place.

345
00:11:43,020 --> 00:11:45,020
- All of a sudden, - The moment you saw her...

346
00:11:45,460 --> 00:11:48,230
- the wind hit me. - We can go down that way.

347
00:11:48,360 --> 00:11:49,490
It's...

348
00:11:50,360 --> 00:11:53,200
Wait. The face of SBS is over there too.

349
00:11:54,770 --> 00:11:56,430
- Gosh. - It's that building.

350
00:11:56,870 --> 00:11:58,400
- Actually, - Great.

351
00:11:58,600 --> 00:12:02,240
I take the vitamin supplement Jae Suk promotes in the morning.

352
00:12:04,070 --> 00:12:05,110
I'm serious.

353
00:12:05,280 --> 00:12:06,839
They recently launched a product...

354
00:12:06,840 --> 00:12:08,380
- with probiotics. - Right.

355
00:12:08,710 --> 00:12:10,079
- I should send some to Sang Woo. - Gosh.

356
00:12:10,080 --> 00:12:11,519
Shouldn't the SBS building...

357
00:12:11,520 --> 00:12:13,080
- have a poster like that? - Seriously.

358
00:12:13,480 --> 00:12:16,820
I'm grateful that I've been their model for a long time.

359
00:12:16,950 --> 00:12:19,089
They should set up a bust...

360
00:12:19,090 --> 00:12:21,190
- at the building too. - That little...

361
00:12:21,430 --> 00:12:24,859
- My gosh. You... - Isn't it a worthy cause, though?

362
00:12:24,860 --> 00:12:26,760
- I just want to zip up his mouth. - Right.

363
00:12:27,230 --> 00:12:29,200
Can't we go that way? No?

364
00:12:29,500 --> 00:12:32,140
- Or can't we take the underpass? - Should we take the underpass?

365
00:12:32,400 --> 00:12:33,569
- Since it's cold? - To cross diagonally...

366
00:12:33,570 --> 00:12:34,969
- It's cold. Take the underpass. - Sure.

367
00:12:34,970 --> 00:12:36,039
- Really? - Yes.

368
00:12:36,040 --> 00:12:38,880
- I've used the crosswalk before. - Right? Here...

369
00:12:40,780 --> 00:12:42,509
- I'm a bit flustered. - Right?

370
00:12:42,510 --> 00:12:43,510
What's going on?

371
00:12:43,511 --> 00:12:45,279
- I'm flustered by the cold weather. - It's so cold. Seriously.

372
00:12:45,280 --> 00:12:47,000
(Chae Won is startled by the intense cold.)

373
00:12:48,650 --> 00:12:51,389
It was really cold when we filmed the movie.

374
00:12:51,390 --> 00:12:52,660
It was cold too.

375
00:12:53,060 --> 00:12:55,929
- We often forget how cold it was. - When you filmed the movie?

376
00:12:55,930 --> 00:12:56,960
Exactly.

377
00:12:57,190 --> 00:12:59,599
Summer is better than winter, right?

378
00:12:59,600 --> 00:13:00,970
Personally, summer is better.

379
00:13:01,270 --> 00:13:03,399
- Diagonal. We must take Exit 8. - Exit 8.

380
00:13:03,400 --> 00:13:05,539
- Exit 8. - Diagonal. Exit 8.

381
00:13:05,540 --> 00:13:07,620
- We can go up that way. - Kukje University of Arts.

382
00:13:08,340 --> 00:13:10,240
This is our 1st shoot in 2026.

383
00:13:10,410 --> 00:13:11,640
Right, it's our first shoot.

384
00:13:11,780 --> 00:13:13,986
- It's a meaningful episode. - I hope we can give some presents.

385
00:13:14,010 --> 00:13:15,410
I hope we can give some presents.

386
00:13:16,480 --> 00:13:17,749
- It's cold today. - We're almost there.

387
00:13:17,750 --> 00:13:18,949
We just have to turn here.

388
00:13:18,950 --> 00:13:20,019
- Really? - Yes.

389
00:13:20,020 --> 00:13:21,750
Talk about some bad timing.

390
00:13:21,950 --> 00:13:23,890
My face cooled down.

391
00:13:24,220 --> 00:13:25,460
- It's more than that. - Right.

392
00:13:25,720 --> 00:13:27,960
Our face is ready for treatments at dermatology clinics.

393
00:13:28,060 --> 00:13:30,100
- Given how numb our face feels, - It feels like...

394
00:13:30,230 --> 00:13:32,159
- anesthesia kicked in. - we can totally get the treatments.

395
00:13:32,160 --> 00:13:33,459
I want to pick a fight.

396
00:13:33,460 --> 00:13:35,060
I won't even feel pain if I get punched.

397
00:13:36,300 --> 00:13:38,400
Come on. You can't pick a fight.

398
00:13:38,570 --> 00:13:40,170
I won't even feel pain if I get punched.

399
00:13:42,110 --> 00:13:44,009
We're here. This is the building.

400
00:13:44,010 --> 00:13:45,639
- This is the place? - On the left.

401
00:13:45,640 --> 00:13:48,480
- She mentioned Korean dramas. - On the left? Right.

402
00:13:48,580 --> 00:13:51,350
It sounded like she was in the drama industry.

403
00:13:52,280 --> 00:13:54,320
- "Film and Digital." - "Film?"

404
00:13:55,220 --> 00:13:56,540
Is it the place with the cameras?

405
00:13:56,720 --> 00:13:57,790
Here?

406
00:13:57,960 --> 00:13:59,420
Let's ask if Naz is here.

407
00:13:59,720 --> 00:14:00,759
Hello.

408
00:14:00,760 --> 00:14:02,359
- She must be in video production. - Hello.

409
00:14:02,360 --> 00:14:03,589
- Are you Naz? - Hello.

410
00:14:03,590 --> 00:14:05,400
- Yes. Hello. - Hello.

411
00:14:05,800 --> 00:14:08,370
- Hello. - Hello. Nice to meet you.

412
00:14:08,670 --> 00:14:09,770
Hello.

413
00:14:10,270 --> 00:14:12,500
- Hello, Naz. Nice to meet you. - Hello.

414
00:14:12,670 --> 00:14:14,439
- Nice to meet you. - Happy New Year.

415
00:14:14,440 --> 00:14:15,840
Happy New Year.

416
00:14:16,070 --> 00:14:17,710
- Nice to meet you. - Hello.

417
00:14:18,340 --> 00:14:21,080
- I thought I'd freeze to death. - Right? Isn't it freezing today?

418
00:14:21,510 --> 00:14:24,150
- I thought I'd freeze to death. - Right? Isn't it freezing today?

419
00:14:24,920 --> 00:14:27,620
- Why are you complaining to her? - Isn't it cold today?

420
00:14:28,790 --> 00:14:30,690
(Acting too casual as soon as they meet)

421
00:14:30,820 --> 00:14:32,659
- Nice to meet you. - Nice to meet you.

422
00:14:32,660 --> 00:14:34,119
I guess you work...

423
00:14:34,120 --> 00:14:36,159
- at a video-related company. - That's right.

424
00:14:36,160 --> 00:14:37,189
- Do you lend cameras? - We...

425
00:14:37,190 --> 00:14:39,330
That's right. This is a rental shop.

426
00:14:39,530 --> 00:14:42,529
We lend high-end cameras...

427
00:14:42,530 --> 00:14:45,099
for dramas and movies for a fee.

428
00:14:45,100 --> 00:14:46,999
(These cameras captured countless actors and actresses.)

429
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:48,169
"The Interest of Love" used...

430
00:14:48,170 --> 00:14:50,090
- our service too. - "The Interest of Love" too?

431
00:14:50,910 --> 00:14:52,430
(The poster of "The Interest of Love")

432
00:14:53,510 --> 00:14:55,209
So people rent cameras from this shop?

433
00:14:55,210 --> 00:14:56,879
- They rent cameras... - That's right. They do.

434
00:14:56,880 --> 00:14:57,950
For dramas and movies.

435
00:14:58,420 --> 00:15:00,519
- We used to work with film rolls. - Right.

436
00:15:00,520 --> 00:15:02,449
- Film rolls... - Our company has been operating...

437
00:15:02,450 --> 00:15:04,990
- for over 20 years. - It's been around for a long time.

438
00:15:05,220 --> 00:15:07,989
- She's so eloquent. - She's amazing.

439
00:15:07,990 --> 00:15:09,190
How is she so good?

440
00:15:09,630 --> 00:15:10,730
Her Korean is amazing.

441
00:15:10,930 --> 00:15:13,029
Naz, where are you from?

442
00:15:13,030 --> 00:15:14,629
- I'm from Iran. - Iran?

443
00:15:14,630 --> 00:15:15,630
- Yes. - I see.

444
00:15:15,631 --> 00:15:17,670
- Only my parents are in Iran now. - I see.

445
00:15:18,400 --> 00:15:21,000
You speak like a native.

446
00:15:21,440 --> 00:15:22,769
I've been here a long time.

447
00:15:22,770 --> 00:15:23,850
How many years has it been?

448
00:15:24,010 --> 00:15:26,279
I came here in 2018.

449
00:15:26,280 --> 00:15:27,709
It's my ninth year.

450
00:15:27,710 --> 00:15:29,580
- It's your 9th year. - It's your 9th year.

451
00:15:29,710 --> 00:15:30,750
Yes.

452
00:15:30,810 --> 00:15:32,679
You came to Korea after watching a Korean drama.

453
00:15:32,680 --> 00:15:34,449
I was watching the drama by chance...

454
00:15:34,450 --> 00:15:36,220
and thought the Korean language was so cute.

455
00:15:36,850 --> 00:15:39,659
But I used to hate learning new languages with passion.

456
00:15:39,660 --> 00:15:40,689
I really hated it.

457
00:15:40,690 --> 00:15:42,010
But this was the only language...

458
00:15:43,060 --> 00:15:44,859
- "With passion." - "With passion."

459
00:15:44,860 --> 00:15:46,729
- Wait, I can't say that on TV? - No, you can say that.

460
00:15:46,730 --> 00:15:48,699
It's okay. Your Korean is just so fluent.

461
00:15:48,700 --> 00:15:50,830
- Your vocabulary is advanced. - Seriously.

462
00:15:50,930 --> 00:15:53,569
I thought it was a cute language and fell in love with it.

463
00:15:53,570 --> 00:15:57,510
So I learned the Korean alphabet online.

464
00:15:57,780 --> 00:16:00,809
Then I wanted to study in Korea.

465
00:16:00,810 --> 00:16:02,409
- Right? - Her intonation is great.

466
00:16:02,410 --> 00:16:03,480
Yes.

467
00:16:03,650 --> 00:16:06,220
I understand that she was interested in our language and all.

468
00:16:06,520 --> 00:16:08,449
But Korean isn't an easy language...

469
00:16:08,450 --> 00:16:10,249
- to learn. - It's difficult.

470
00:16:10,250 --> 00:16:11,360
- It's hard. - Yes.

471
00:16:11,390 --> 00:16:12,889
- Right. - Is there a word...

472
00:16:12,890 --> 00:16:14,210
you have a hard time pronouncing?

473
00:16:14,360 --> 00:16:15,360
- Yes, there is. - Yes.

474
00:16:15,361 --> 00:16:17,589
Words with syllables that end consecutively...

475
00:16:17,590 --> 00:16:20,229
- I see. - in L, N, or vowels are difficult.

476
00:16:20,230 --> 00:16:22,570
- So here's an example. - I see.

477
00:16:22,600 --> 00:16:24,499
"Adapt" in Korean is "suneung."

478
00:16:24,500 --> 00:16:26,770
But I end up slurring the syllables.

479
00:16:26,900 --> 00:16:28,416
If you go outside now, it happens to everyone.

480
00:16:28,440 --> 00:16:29,510
Seriously.

481
00:16:29,740 --> 00:16:31,070
That's so true.

482
00:16:32,410 --> 00:16:34,240
If you go outside now...

483
00:16:34,880 --> 00:16:36,049
It was no joke.

484
00:16:36,050 --> 00:16:37,580
I thought my ears would fall off.

485
00:16:38,220 --> 00:16:41,350
Chae Won just started to wake up from the cold now.

486
00:16:41,690 --> 00:16:42,750
Okay.

487
00:16:42,950 --> 00:16:45,460
- My ears... I can hear again now. - Now?

488
00:16:45,990 --> 00:16:47,019
- Your ears were blocked. - Right.

489
00:16:47,020 --> 00:16:49,300
- My ears were slightly blocked. - That's understandable.

490
00:16:49,360 --> 00:16:51,859
How did you end up working in a camera rental shop...

491
00:16:51,860 --> 00:16:55,769
- after moving to Korea? - Oh, that?

492
00:16:55,770 --> 00:16:57,369
After coming to Korea,

493
00:16:57,370 --> 00:16:59,839
I studied Korean for a year at a school.

494
00:16:59,840 --> 00:17:01,370
- Really? - After learning Korean,

495
00:17:01,470 --> 00:17:03,270
I entered Korea National University of Arts.

496
00:17:03,870 --> 00:17:05,479
- I majored in Film. - You did?

497
00:17:05,480 --> 00:17:07,380
- I studied film production. - Right.

498
00:17:07,710 --> 00:17:09,749
I also have field experience.

499
00:17:09,750 --> 00:17:11,450
Which drama did you work on?

500
00:17:12,420 --> 00:17:13,979
My first drama was...

501
00:17:13,980 --> 00:17:16,150
- "Bad and Crazy..." - "Bad and Crazy."

502
00:17:16,620 --> 00:17:20,059
- while going to school. - While going to school.

503
00:17:20,060 --> 00:17:22,059
It sounds like you were on the right track.

504
00:17:22,060 --> 00:17:23,659
I did work hard.

505
00:17:23,660 --> 00:17:24,829
(Naz dreamed of working in filming.)

506
00:17:24,830 --> 00:17:28,570
As soon as I graduated in August, I joined this company.

507
00:17:28,670 --> 00:17:29,929
That's impressive.

508
00:17:29,930 --> 00:17:31,869
Now, I'm getting used to the job.

509
00:17:31,870 --> 00:17:33,439
- I'm doing okay now. - I see.

510
00:17:33,440 --> 00:17:34,970
You sound pretty confident now.

511
00:17:35,410 --> 00:17:37,209
I still have a lot to learn, though.

512
00:17:37,210 --> 00:17:38,340
- Really? - Yes.

513
00:17:38,740 --> 00:17:41,810
How did you end up writing to our show?

514
00:17:42,480 --> 00:17:44,079
We just finished...

515
00:17:44,080 --> 00:17:45,679
- one of our busy seasons. - Really?

516
00:17:45,680 --> 00:17:47,520
Here's how it goes for us.

517
00:17:47,620 --> 00:17:51,320
There's a pre-production stage before the shoot.

518
00:17:51,490 --> 00:17:54,660
And we get quite busy once they finish filming...

519
00:17:54,830 --> 00:17:57,160
and return the equipment.

520
00:17:57,260 --> 00:18:00,329
I don't have a lot of days when I get to relax like this.

521
00:18:00,330 --> 00:18:01,469
- Really? - Yes.

522
00:18:01,470 --> 00:18:05,039
- And our industry never sleeps. - Our shop never sleeps either.

523
00:18:05,040 --> 00:18:06,139
- Really? - Yes.

524
00:18:06,140 --> 00:18:08,109
- So they can return anytime? - We also open...

525
00:18:08,110 --> 00:18:09,369
- We have a three-shift system. - Right.

526
00:18:09,370 --> 00:18:10,669
- We're open 24 hours. - You have a 3-shift system.

527
00:18:10,670 --> 00:18:12,379
- Yes. - You rarely get to rest then.

528
00:18:12,380 --> 00:18:13,409
That's true.

529
00:18:13,410 --> 00:18:16,279
So the job comes with all the insurance benefits?

530
00:18:16,280 --> 00:18:17,309
Of course. Yes.

531
00:18:17,310 --> 00:18:19,080
Otherwise, I couldn't get my visa.

532
00:18:19,850 --> 00:18:20,920
The visa.

533
00:18:21,590 --> 00:18:24,449
- You're a worker in Korea. - Yes, I am.

534
00:18:24,450 --> 00:18:26,119
(She's a real-life worker in Korea.)

535
00:18:26,120 --> 00:18:27,519
- Yes. - So...

536
00:18:27,520 --> 00:18:30,459
don't you have to send some money to your parents?

537
00:18:30,460 --> 00:18:32,729
In our culture, children...

538
00:18:32,730 --> 00:18:35,569
- can give money to their parents. - That's not... I see.

539
00:18:35,570 --> 00:18:36,869
But they'd react this way.

540
00:18:36,870 --> 00:18:39,139
"I'm doing fine. Why are you giving me money?"

541
00:18:39,140 --> 00:18:41,339
That's the culture.

542
00:18:41,340 --> 00:18:42,540
I hope my mom's like that too.

543
00:18:44,470 --> 00:18:45,980
Sang Woo, you should be quiet.

544
00:18:46,310 --> 00:18:47,950
What's wrong with you?

545
00:18:48,180 --> 00:18:50,080
Be quiet, and just listen.

546
00:18:50,650 --> 00:18:51,879
Come on.

547
00:18:51,880 --> 00:18:53,179
What do you think about this culture in Iran?

548
00:18:53,180 --> 00:18:54,479
- What? - What do you think about it?

549
00:18:54,480 --> 00:18:55,820
It's not so bad.

550
00:18:57,190 --> 00:18:58,490
It's a good deal for us.

551
00:19:03,330 --> 00:19:05,899
Naz. What do you usually do on your days off?

552
00:19:05,900 --> 00:19:06,900
On my days off?

553
00:19:07,260 --> 00:19:09,900
I got into freediving recently.

554
00:19:10,570 --> 00:19:12,939
Yes. Let's say I dive into the sea.

555
00:19:12,940 --> 00:19:16,509
The view underwater is so beautiful.

556
00:19:16,510 --> 00:19:18,739
- It's so beautiful. - I see.

557
00:19:18,740 --> 00:19:20,979
- I don't hear anything underwater. - Right.

558
00:19:20,980 --> 00:19:23,149
That helps me de-stress.

559
00:19:23,150 --> 00:19:24,350
(She gets to rest in silence.)

560
00:19:25,050 --> 00:19:26,720
(Amazed by her cool hobby)

561
00:19:27,080 --> 00:19:29,220
She has a proactive attitude.

562
00:19:29,920 --> 00:19:32,389
Moving to Korea from Iran couldn't have been easy.

563
00:19:32,390 --> 00:19:33,390
Of course, not.

564
00:19:33,391 --> 00:19:35,259
She found a job here in Korea.

565
00:19:35,260 --> 00:19:37,489
So she's quite...

566
00:19:37,490 --> 00:19:38,700
aggressive.

567
00:19:39,700 --> 00:19:41,259
- Aggressive? - She's adventurous.

568
00:19:41,260 --> 00:19:42,269
She's proactive.

569
00:19:42,270 --> 00:19:43,999
- Aggressive? - She's adventurous.

570
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:46,899
- She's proactive. - My gosh.

571
00:19:46,900 --> 00:19:49,139
She likes to take on challenges.

572
00:19:49,140 --> 00:19:50,140
(Everyone tries to correct him.)

573
00:19:50,141 --> 00:19:52,179
- I meant... I'm sorry. - I'm not aggressive.

574
00:19:52,180 --> 00:19:54,180
It seems my vocabulary is more limited than yours.

575
00:19:55,380 --> 00:19:56,700
Your vocabulary is more advanced.

576
00:19:57,610 --> 00:19:59,420
- That's so true. - I called her aggressive.

577
00:19:59,620 --> 00:20:02,050
Naz is using a wider range of vocabulary.

578
00:20:02,090 --> 00:20:03,090
Seriously.

579
00:20:03,820 --> 00:20:05,489
Look at this. "I ran" into an impressive girl.

580
00:20:05,490 --> 00:20:07,020
Come on!

581
00:20:07,520 --> 00:20:08,529
(Making an aggressive joke out of anxiety)

582
00:20:08,530 --> 00:20:09,630
Come on!

583
00:20:10,160 --> 00:20:14,129
- He's indeed a comedy actor. - What?

584
00:20:14,130 --> 00:20:15,329
- It's as expected. - I told you, right?

585
00:20:15,330 --> 00:20:16,899
She actually understood my joke.

586
00:20:16,900 --> 00:20:18,176
(She perfectly understood the ridiculous wordplay.)

587
00:20:18,200 --> 00:20:19,539
She's amazing.

588
00:20:19,540 --> 00:20:21,470
My gosh, seriously. He's the comedy godfather.

589
00:20:22,110 --> 00:20:24,269
All right. Let's give it a try.

590
00:20:24,270 --> 00:20:26,410
- It's the dice. - Please get number two.

591
00:20:26,510 --> 00:20:27,579
Who...

592
00:20:27,580 --> 00:20:30,080
- All right. - Sang Woo's athletic side...

593
00:20:30,950 --> 00:20:31,980
All right.

594
00:20:32,580 --> 00:20:34,149
- Please. - Please give us number two.

595
00:20:34,150 --> 00:20:35,190
Please.

596
00:20:35,450 --> 00:20:36,890
(Desperate)

597
00:20:37,190 --> 00:20:38,989
- Please. - It's number one.

598
00:20:38,990 --> 00:20:41,089
(They obtain 1 coupon.)

599
00:20:41,090 --> 00:20:42,229
(Disappointed)

600
00:20:42,230 --> 00:20:43,330
That's great.

601
00:20:43,660 --> 00:20:45,630
- This is good. One coupon. - It's good.

602
00:20:46,060 --> 00:20:47,559
- Let's start with Round 1. - Round 1.

603
00:20:47,560 --> 00:20:48,800
The fortune cookies.

604
00:20:51,740 --> 00:20:54,499
"I went to Ulleung Island last year. I want to visit..."

605
00:20:54,500 --> 00:20:56,039
"Jeju Island for diving this year."

606
00:20:56,040 --> 00:20:58,839
It's a round-trip business-class ticket.

607
00:20:58,840 --> 00:21:00,209
(Round 1's Prize: A round-trip business-class ticket to Jeju)

608
00:21:00,210 --> 00:21:02,970
(A round-trip business-class ticket to Jeju Island for a diving trip)

609
00:21:04,950 --> 00:21:07,019
- Round-trip business class ticket. - Round-trip business class ticket.

610
00:21:07,020 --> 00:21:08,049
(It's a round-trip business-class ticket.)

611
00:21:08,050 --> 00:21:10,049
That's great.

612
00:21:10,050 --> 00:21:11,190
With this,

613
00:21:11,320 --> 00:21:13,590
you can go to Jeju Island for a diving trip.

614
00:21:13,690 --> 00:21:16,259
She can enjoy her hobby with this present.

615
00:21:16,260 --> 00:21:17,790
- I love it. - This is great.

616
00:21:18,030 --> 00:21:19,499
(The round-trip flight ticket is at stake on this mission.)

617
00:21:19,500 --> 00:21:22,269
(Guess Who: Actors and Actresses)

618
00:21:22,270 --> 00:21:23,270
(Round 1)

619
00:21:23,271 --> 00:21:24,399
(When a photo is presented, )

620
00:21:24,400 --> 00:21:27,800
(they must name the actor or actress and one of their dramas or movies.)

621
00:21:27,900 --> 00:21:29,239
- This is so hard. - What?

622
00:21:29,240 --> 00:21:30,409
- We have to name them... - One of their projects too?

623
00:21:30,410 --> 00:21:31,850
- and 1 of their projects? - Just 1.

624
00:21:31,910 --> 00:21:34,439
- Their projects too? - It's hard for everyone to succeed.

625
00:21:34,440 --> 00:21:35,510
All of us?

626
00:21:35,810 --> 00:21:37,250
Please do a good job.

627
00:21:37,950 --> 00:21:39,520
I'm sorry. We're not good at this.

628
00:21:39,950 --> 00:21:42,319
This is the hardest mission for us.

629
00:21:42,320 --> 00:21:43,749
- I know. - Guessing their names...

630
00:21:43,750 --> 00:21:44,919
- This mission... - You've watched our show?

631
00:21:44,920 --> 00:21:47,219
- Of course. - We're not good at this.

632
00:21:47,220 --> 00:21:49,359
Sang Woo, are you good at this kind of quiz?

633
00:21:49,360 --> 00:21:51,600
I'm actually not good at this.

634
00:21:52,100 --> 00:21:53,130
(Glancing)

635
00:21:53,330 --> 00:21:55,800
I don't feel confident. What do I do?

636
00:21:56,200 --> 00:21:57,769
My gosh. Things might get awkward with my colleagues.

637
00:21:57,770 --> 00:21:59,539
- Seriously. - Our colleagues...

638
00:21:59,540 --> 00:22:02,009
This game will ruin our friendships.

639
00:22:02,010 --> 00:22:04,009
- My gosh. It will get awkward. - Why are you doing this to us?

640
00:22:04,010 --> 00:22:05,010
This is...

641
00:22:05,011 --> 00:22:07,309
- Let's do this. All right. - Bring it in.

642
00:22:07,310 --> 00:22:08,509
- In 1, 2, 3. - In 1, 2, 3.

643
00:22:08,510 --> 00:22:09,579
- Let's go! - Let's go!

644
00:22:09,580 --> 00:22:11,519
(Out of 10 total tries, they're on try number 1.)

645
00:22:11,520 --> 00:22:12,750
Here we go.

646
00:22:12,880 --> 00:22:14,279
- All right. We'll begin. - Don't be nervous.

647
00:22:14,280 --> 00:22:17,520
It's best to figure out the answer before speaking.

648
00:22:17,890 --> 00:22:19,859
(You got this!)

649
00:22:19,860 --> 00:22:20,959
All right. We'll begin.

650
00:22:20,960 --> 00:22:22,689
- Remembering their projects... - It's hard to remember them.

651
00:22:22,690 --> 00:22:23,790
Cue.

652
00:22:24,290 --> 00:22:25,899
- One, two, three. - Kim Hye Soo.

653
00:22:25,900 --> 00:22:28,129
- "The Age of Shadows." - Incorrect.

654
00:22:28,130 --> 00:22:29,699
- It's "Tazza." - Wait.

655
00:22:29,700 --> 00:22:30,969
- You meant to say "Smugglers." - Incorrect.

656
00:22:30,970 --> 00:22:33,039
(They instantly fail on their first try.)

657
00:22:33,040 --> 00:22:34,069
Hye Soo...

658
00:22:34,070 --> 00:22:35,550
- I meant "Smugglers." - "Smugglers."

659
00:22:36,110 --> 00:22:37,839
- "The Age of Shadows?" - He confused the two.

660
00:22:37,840 --> 00:22:39,640
- "The Age of Shadows?" - Or "Tazza."

661
00:22:39,980 --> 00:22:41,779
- I know "Tazza." - My gosh.

662
00:22:41,780 --> 00:22:43,909
- I meant... - Will it get awkward with her?

663
00:22:43,910 --> 00:22:45,119
(They hosted the Blue Dragon Film Awards together for 6 years.)

664
00:22:45,120 --> 00:22:48,119
Come on. She was in so many movies and dramas.

665
00:22:48,120 --> 00:22:49,189
I know them.

666
00:22:49,190 --> 00:22:51,189
- Yes. It was a slip of the tongue. - But...

667
00:22:51,190 --> 00:22:52,620
It was an honest mistake.

668
00:22:52,720 --> 00:22:54,120
- Come on. - My gosh.

669
00:22:54,290 --> 00:22:55,630
- You... - I won't go first.

670
00:22:56,260 --> 00:22:57,759
- Then... - I won't go first.

671
00:22:57,760 --> 00:22:58,999
Can you go first, Chae Won?

672
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:00,199
- Gosh, me? - You should go first.

673
00:23:00,200 --> 00:23:01,360
Okay.

674
00:23:01,400 --> 00:23:02,899
- Sang Woo. - Okay.

675
00:23:02,900 --> 00:23:04,330
- Gosh. - Okay.

676
00:23:04,570 --> 00:23:06,769
- Here we go. - We can do this. In 1, 2, 3.

677
00:23:06,770 --> 00:23:08,340
- Here we go. - Here we go.

678
00:23:08,670 --> 00:23:09,810
This is your second try.

679
00:23:11,980 --> 00:23:14,109
- Question, cue. - This is the most difficult game.

680
00:23:14,110 --> 00:23:15,279
(Project Title, Name)

681
00:23:15,280 --> 00:23:17,049
One, two, three.

682
00:23:17,050 --> 00:23:18,450
Park Seo Jun.

683
00:23:19,250 --> 00:23:22,819
- Incorrect. - "Itaewon Class."

684
00:23:22,820 --> 00:23:23,820
(She was calm, but ran out of time.)

685
00:23:23,821 --> 00:23:25,889
- It's hard to say it quickly. - Why can't I say it quickly?

686
00:23:25,890 --> 00:23:27,019
- Right. - This is...

687
00:23:27,020 --> 00:23:28,020
- Chae Won. - Listen.

688
00:23:28,021 --> 00:23:30,090
- You can't just... - Listen, Jae Suk.

689
00:23:30,260 --> 00:23:33,029
- He was in so many projects. - She did well.

690
00:23:33,030 --> 00:23:35,929
I had a long list of his dramas and movies.

691
00:23:35,930 --> 00:23:37,299
I couldn't just pick one.

692
00:23:37,300 --> 00:23:38,739
- That's my point. - Right?

693
00:23:38,740 --> 00:23:39,869
That's my point.

694
00:23:39,870 --> 00:23:41,069
- That's it. - That's it.

695
00:23:41,070 --> 00:23:42,309
- Right? - All right. Sang Woo.

696
00:23:42,310 --> 00:23:43,709
- All right. Sang Woo. - Yes.

697
00:23:43,710 --> 00:23:45,039
- You should go first. - Wait.

698
00:23:45,040 --> 00:23:46,040
You should go first.

699
00:23:46,041 --> 00:23:47,509
- Viewers. - This is...

700
00:23:47,510 --> 00:23:48,510
It's not that we don't know.

701
00:23:48,511 --> 00:23:50,609
- You know what? - We can't pick one quickly.

702
00:23:50,610 --> 00:23:52,580
To have any kind of excuse,

703
00:23:52,980 --> 00:23:54,990
two of us should have succeeded.

704
00:23:55,720 --> 00:23:57,649
(He's ready!)

705
00:23:57,650 --> 00:23:58,759
- Sang Woo. - Here we go.

706
00:23:58,760 --> 00:23:59,959
Let's do this. All right.

707
00:23:59,960 --> 00:24:01,296
(Out of 10 total tries, they're on try number 3.)

708
00:24:01,320 --> 00:24:03,889
Question, cue.

709
00:24:03,890 --> 00:24:04,899
(Project Title, Name)

710
00:24:04,900 --> 00:24:07,100
- One, two, three. - Han Ji Min.

711
00:24:07,160 --> 00:24:08,200
Incorrect.

712
00:24:08,830 --> 00:24:09,869
"Love Scout."

713
00:24:09,870 --> 00:24:11,230
Incorrect.

714
00:24:11,400 --> 00:24:13,069
- "Love Scout." - Did he just...

715
00:24:13,070 --> 00:24:14,169
This one is tough.

716
00:24:14,170 --> 00:24:15,609
Did he just chuckle?

717
00:24:15,610 --> 00:24:16,709
We can't get past the first one.

718
00:24:16,710 --> 00:24:17,840
- Jae Suk. - Sang Woo.

719
00:24:18,040 --> 00:24:20,409
- What was that? - Wait. My gosh.

720
00:24:20,410 --> 00:24:23,049
I only focused on remembering her name.

721
00:24:23,050 --> 00:24:25,419
- We can't get past the first one. - She was in so many projects.

722
00:24:25,420 --> 00:24:28,319
- Did you remember one? - "Jewel in the Crown."

723
00:24:28,320 --> 00:24:29,419
That was a long time ago, though.

724
00:24:29,420 --> 00:24:31,219
It doesn't matter. We just have to name one.

725
00:24:31,220 --> 00:24:32,959
(After Jae Suk brags, )

726
00:24:32,960 --> 00:24:33,989
(he goes to the make-or-break spot.)

727
00:24:33,990 --> 00:24:35,429
- I can't name it quickly. - We keep changing seats...

728
00:24:35,430 --> 00:24:38,030
- after we fail. - This is our fourth try already?

729
00:24:38,800 --> 00:24:40,229
How is this possible?

730
00:24:40,230 --> 00:24:42,569
To make it worse, we didn't get past the first one.

731
00:24:42,570 --> 00:24:43,929
(It didn't make it to the rest.)

732
00:24:43,930 --> 00:24:44,969
This is bad.

733
00:24:44,970 --> 00:24:46,239
(What an embarrassing situation this is.)

734
00:24:46,240 --> 00:24:48,570
Seriously. This is just ridiculous.

735
00:24:49,040 --> 00:24:51,939
All right. Bring it in. Let's get a grip, everyone.

736
00:24:51,940 --> 00:24:54,339
- Okay. Let's do it. In 1, 2, 3. - In 1, 2, 3.

737
00:24:54,340 --> 00:24:55,349
- Let's go. - Let's go.

738
00:24:55,350 --> 00:24:57,179
- It's the fourth question. - Here we go.

739
00:24:57,180 --> 00:24:58,919
Okay. Question, cue.

740
00:24:58,920 --> 00:24:59,920
(Project Title, Name)

741
00:24:59,921 --> 00:25:02,450
- One, two, three. - Woo Seok. All right.

742
00:25:03,720 --> 00:25:06,019
(You can't discuss Byeon Woo Seok without mentioning...)

743
00:25:06,020 --> 00:25:08,259
(this super famous drama.)

744
00:25:08,260 --> 00:25:10,459
(Project Title, Name: Byeon Woo Seok)

745
00:25:10,460 --> 00:25:12,160
- All right. - Incorrect.

746
00:25:13,330 --> 00:25:14,400
Incorrect.

747
00:25:15,070 --> 00:25:16,599
He didn't even say his last name.

748
00:25:16,600 --> 00:25:18,129
(Our Not-So-Lovely Runner, Jae Suk)

749
00:25:18,130 --> 00:25:20,439
- His last name. - You didn't say his last name.

750
00:25:20,440 --> 00:25:21,940
What's his last name?

751
00:25:22,640 --> 00:25:24,269
- Jae Suk. - Jae Suk.

752
00:25:24,270 --> 00:25:25,439
- You... - I...

753
00:25:25,440 --> 00:25:26,509
- I... - You scolded us.

754
00:25:26,510 --> 00:25:29,050
- It's one of my favorite dramas. - Woo Seok.

755
00:25:29,480 --> 00:25:31,779
- "Lovely Runner." - The one with Kim Hye Yoon.

756
00:25:31,780 --> 00:25:33,419
- "Lovely Runner." - "Lovely Runner."

757
00:25:33,420 --> 00:25:34,879
You told us to run the show.

758
00:25:34,880 --> 00:25:37,620
- She's filming a drama with IU. - Right.

759
00:25:37,820 --> 00:25:40,189
- Don't remember that afterward. - Right.

760
00:25:40,190 --> 00:25:41,889
First of all, I was surprised...

761
00:25:41,890 --> 00:25:43,560
to see his photo.

762
00:25:44,590 --> 00:25:45,859
- Why? - Why?

763
00:25:45,860 --> 00:25:47,700
Why were you surprised?

764
00:25:48,300 --> 00:25:50,330
Not one of us can succeed?

765
00:25:50,730 --> 00:25:51,870
Gosh, this is...

766
00:25:52,500 --> 00:25:55,609
(None of them was able...)

767
00:25:55,610 --> 00:25:59,210
(to get past the dreadful first question.)

768
00:26:00,510 --> 00:26:02,249
(Their performance issue is worse in person.)

769
00:26:02,250 --> 00:26:04,609
- Seriously. Let's focus. - Round One...

770
00:26:04,610 --> 00:26:06,010
- Let's do it. - Let's bring it in.

771
00:26:07,050 --> 00:26:08,819
- Wait. - All right.

772
00:26:08,820 --> 00:26:11,089
- We must review our projects too. - Hey.

773
00:26:11,090 --> 00:26:12,859
- "Mood of the Day." - That's one.

774
00:26:12,860 --> 00:26:14,259
What else were you in?

775
00:26:14,260 --> 00:26:16,189
- "Flower of Evil." - "Flower of Evil."

776
00:26:16,190 --> 00:26:18,400
- Yes. - I loved the drama.

777
00:26:18,660 --> 00:26:19,860
- Great. - Thank you.

778
00:26:21,130 --> 00:26:22,399
- "Flower of Evil." - I loved it.

779
00:26:22,400 --> 00:26:23,469
(Naz seems to know a lot.)

780
00:26:23,470 --> 00:26:25,699
- Great. Go with that, Chae Won. - Yes.

781
00:26:25,700 --> 00:26:26,869
"Hitman." Hey.

782
00:26:26,870 --> 00:26:28,939
Naz should play this time.

783
00:26:28,940 --> 00:26:30,769
- All right. - Let's use the coupon.

784
00:26:30,770 --> 00:26:31,779
- All right. - Let's use it.

785
00:26:31,780 --> 00:26:33,979
I think Naz has to start this off.

786
00:26:33,980 --> 00:26:35,310
And I'll sit this one out.

787
00:26:35,510 --> 00:26:36,850
What are you talking about?

788
00:26:37,310 --> 00:26:38,849
- What? Hold on. - Sit back down.

789
00:26:38,850 --> 00:26:41,680
- I should sit this one out. - She has to pick.

790
00:26:41,950 --> 00:26:43,389
We'll use the coupon.

791
00:26:43,390 --> 00:26:46,489
Naz, pick a person who will sit this one out,

792
00:26:46,490 --> 00:26:48,360
and stare at that person.

793
00:26:48,890 --> 00:26:50,459
(No one seems reliable.)

794
00:26:50,460 --> 00:26:52,800
(But whom does she want to get rid of the most?)

795
00:26:53,130 --> 00:26:56,470
- Yeon Seok? - Thank you.

796
00:26:57,470 --> 00:26:58,799
- Let's do this. - Let's go.

797
00:26:58,800 --> 00:27:00,476
- Let's do this. - I bet she's better than us.

798
00:27:00,500 --> 00:27:01,599
- Much better. - I knew it the moment...

799
00:27:01,600 --> 00:27:02,609
she said "Flower of Evil."

800
00:27:02,610 --> 00:27:05,409
All right. Question, cue.

801
00:27:05,410 --> 00:27:06,509
(Project Title, Name)

802
00:27:06,510 --> 00:27:07,510
One...

803
00:27:07,510 --> 00:27:08,510
(Sighing)

804
00:27:08,910 --> 00:27:12,119
(This one is easy.)

805
00:27:12,120 --> 00:27:13,120
(Sighing)

806
00:27:13,121 --> 00:27:14,180
Three.

807
00:27:14,280 --> 00:27:15,520
What was that, Naz?

808
00:27:16,250 --> 00:27:17,520
What was that, Naz?

809
00:27:18,860 --> 00:27:21,490
(She couldn't even guess his name.)

810
00:27:22,690 --> 00:27:24,689
(This wasn't part of their plan.)

811
00:27:24,690 --> 00:27:25,860
He gave us an easy one.

812
00:27:26,300 --> 00:27:27,330
What?

813
00:27:27,430 --> 00:27:29,170
You could've said "No Other Choice."

814
00:27:29,300 --> 00:27:31,569
- Or "Masquerade." - Lee Byung Hun.

815
00:27:31,570 --> 00:27:33,569
(Oh, right. His name is Lee Byung Hun.)

816
00:27:33,570 --> 00:27:35,169
Come on. That's an old photo!

817
00:27:35,170 --> 00:27:36,740
- Give me a recent photo. - He's old?

818
00:27:37,410 --> 00:27:38,710
Oh, you mean the photo?

819
00:27:38,880 --> 00:27:39,880
- You failed. - Okay.

820
00:27:40,280 --> 00:27:42,410
Why can't we get past the first one?

821
00:27:42,750 --> 00:27:43,950
Gosh, this is...

822
00:27:44,050 --> 00:27:45,149
- It's so hard. - It's way too hard.

823
00:27:45,150 --> 00:27:46,470
- That's the hardest part. - Yes.

824
00:27:47,250 --> 00:27:48,690
We must pass Round One.

825
00:27:48,920 --> 00:27:50,819
- Let's focus. - Let's do this.

826
00:27:50,820 --> 00:27:52,790
- Chae Won. Let's do this. - Okay.

827
00:27:53,420 --> 00:27:55,960
This is our sixth try. Here we go.

828
00:27:56,160 --> 00:27:57,890
Question, cue.

829
00:27:58,330 --> 00:27:59,999
One, two, three.

830
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:02,029
Choi Min Sik. "Oldboy."

831
00:28:02,030 --> 00:28:03,070
Correct.

832
00:28:03,330 --> 00:28:05,339
Choi Min Sik. "Oldboy."

833
00:28:05,340 --> 00:28:08,070
(They finally get past the first one.)

834
00:28:08,170 --> 00:28:09,810
- You were calm. - That's great.

835
00:28:09,910 --> 00:28:12,040
- We have to stay calm. - Yes, we must be calm.

836
00:28:12,340 --> 00:28:13,409
Here we go.

837
00:28:13,410 --> 00:28:14,940
- Cue. - Stay calm.

838
00:28:15,010 --> 00:28:16,149
- One, - Be calm.

839
00:28:16,150 --> 00:28:17,709
- two, three. - Kang Ha Neul.

840
00:28:17,710 --> 00:28:19,319
- "The Pirates 2." - Correct.

841
00:28:19,320 --> 00:28:20,420
That was great.

842
00:28:21,020 --> 00:28:23,489
(For the first time, they make it halfway.)

843
00:28:23,490 --> 00:28:25,089
- You were... - That was good.

844
00:28:25,090 --> 00:28:26,519
- That's a good strategy too. - Yes.

845
00:28:26,520 --> 00:28:29,090
- We can name them first. - Be calm.

846
00:28:30,590 --> 00:28:31,659
Next question.

847
00:28:31,660 --> 00:28:32,699
(The next player is Yeon Seok.)

848
00:28:32,700 --> 00:28:33,700
Cue.

849
00:28:34,430 --> 00:28:35,699
- One, two... - IU,

850
00:28:35,700 --> 00:28:36,929
"When Life Gives You Tangerines."

851
00:28:36,930 --> 00:28:38,740
(Correct)

852
00:28:38,800 --> 00:28:42,510
- You're right. - You're right.

853
00:28:42,640 --> 00:28:45,039
The pressure is on Jae Suk now.

854
00:28:45,040 --> 00:28:46,560
(Only 1 question left to pass Round 1)

855
00:28:47,580 --> 00:28:48,580
Please.

856
00:28:49,180 --> 00:28:51,010
(Exhaling)

857
00:28:51,310 --> 00:28:52,320
All right.

858
00:28:52,720 --> 00:28:53,720
Please.

859
00:28:57,320 --> 00:28:58,419
- Good luck. - I need to succeed...

860
00:28:58,420 --> 00:28:59,559
to pass Round One.

861
00:28:59,560 --> 00:29:01,519
Ready. The last question.

862
00:29:01,520 --> 00:29:03,360
- For real. - Next question. Cue.

863
00:29:04,290 --> 00:29:06,560
- One, two... - Park Bo Young.

864
00:29:07,760 --> 00:29:08,769
Park Bo Young.

865
00:29:08,770 --> 00:29:13,170
(All he needs to answer is one of Park Bo Young's works!)

866
00:29:14,440 --> 00:29:16,070
- Two... - Park Bo Young,

867
00:29:16,940 --> 00:29:18,140
- "Sunshine..." - Incorrect.

868
00:29:18,610 --> 00:29:19,780
- "Sunshine..." - Incorrect.

869
00:29:19,910 --> 00:29:21,140
What? Sorry?

870
00:29:21,210 --> 00:29:23,310
"Sunshine?"

871
00:29:24,950 --> 00:29:27,320
- Does such a drama exist? - Did you miss the sunshine?

872
00:29:28,380 --> 00:29:30,389
- You should get some sunshine... - Listen.

873
00:29:30,390 --> 00:29:31,489
- We're doomed. - Little did I expect it to be...

874
00:29:31,490 --> 00:29:32,666
- Bo Young. - What on earth is “sunshine”?

875
00:29:32,690 --> 00:29:35,330
- "Scandal Makers." - "Scandal Makers."

876
00:29:36,660 --> 00:29:38,780
- I'm too ashamed to look at Naz. - "Scandal Makers."

877
00:29:39,130 --> 00:29:41,599
Jae Suk, what was it about the sunshine?

878
00:29:41,600 --> 00:29:43,330
"Did I get some sunshine today?"

879
00:29:44,700 --> 00:29:46,140
Get some sunshine, okay?

880
00:29:47,300 --> 00:29:48,339
"Daily Dose."

881
00:29:48,340 --> 00:29:50,270
(Finally recalled "Daily Dose of Sunshine")

882
00:29:51,440 --> 00:29:52,540
That was close.

883
00:29:53,240 --> 00:29:55,179
- Go 1st, Jae Suk? - I'll go 1st.

884
00:29:55,180 --> 00:29:56,479
- Okay. - Jae Suk will go first.

885
00:29:56,480 --> 00:29:57,510
I'll go first.

886
00:29:58,820 --> 00:30:01,179
I must succeed. Naz, we will succeed.

887
00:30:01,180 --> 00:30:02,289
- We will pass Round One. - Okay.

888
00:30:02,290 --> 00:30:03,949
- It's okay. - All right.

889
00:30:03,950 --> 00:30:04,950
We'll make it.

890
00:30:04,951 --> 00:30:06,759
(They witnessed the possibility of passing earlier.)

891
00:30:06,760 --> 00:30:08,320
- In 1, 2, 3. Here we go! - Here we go!

892
00:30:08,590 --> 00:30:10,360
Question. Cue.

893
00:30:10,560 --> 00:30:12,600
- One, two, three. - Jun Ji Hyun,

894
00:30:14,030 --> 00:30:15,270
- Incorrect. - "Tazza."

895
00:30:16,130 --> 00:30:17,270
- Incorrect. - "Tazza."

896
00:30:20,870 --> 00:30:22,109
(Sighing)

897
00:30:22,110 --> 00:30:23,809
(Trudging)

898
00:30:23,810 --> 00:30:26,279
- This won't work, will it? - Move down a seat.

899
00:30:26,280 --> 00:30:27,610
- Okay. - Now then.

900
00:30:28,040 --> 00:30:29,350
- Now then. - You...

901
00:30:30,050 --> 00:30:31,080
Oh, no.

902
00:30:31,650 --> 00:30:32,850
I can't do it.

903
00:30:33,180 --> 00:30:35,449
I can't do it right now. Goodness.

904
00:30:35,450 --> 00:30:36,770
Jun Ji Hyun, "Tazza" was a bit...

905
00:30:38,290 --> 00:30:41,060
Maybe she'll be in one of the "Tazza" series.

906
00:30:41,460 --> 00:30:43,559
The "Tazza" movies are constantly released.

907
00:30:43,560 --> 00:30:45,059
Have you not heard rumors of it?

908
00:30:45,060 --> 00:30:46,430
- No. - Really?

909
00:30:46,860 --> 00:30:48,700
(So there are no rumors.)

910
00:30:49,170 --> 00:30:50,970
I've got no face to show Naz.

911
00:30:51,130 --> 00:30:52,200
It's okay.

912
00:30:53,970 --> 00:30:57,339
(Already on their 8th try of Round 1)

913
00:30:57,340 --> 00:30:58,940
Goodness gracious.

914
00:30:59,880 --> 00:31:02,050
It's our eighth try. This is...

915
00:31:02,280 --> 00:31:04,309
- Naz, we'll give it our all. - Thank you.

916
00:31:04,310 --> 00:31:05,720
- Let's go! - Let's go!

917
00:31:05,950 --> 00:31:06,980
Let's go!

918
00:31:07,120 --> 00:31:09,190
Question. Cue.

919
00:31:09,390 --> 00:31:11,390
One, two, three.

920
00:31:11,450 --> 00:31:14,390
Lee Joon Gi, "Flower of Evil."

921
00:31:14,490 --> 00:31:16,529
- She also starred in that. - Well done.

922
00:31:16,530 --> 00:31:18,290
- Chae Won kept her cool. - Gosh.

923
00:31:18,630 --> 00:31:20,359
- Here I go. - Next question. Cue.

924
00:31:20,360 --> 00:31:21,459
My mind goes blank.

925
00:31:21,460 --> 00:31:22,770
Cha Tae Hyun, "Scandal Makers."

926
00:31:23,400 --> 00:31:24,669
- Gosh. - Nice.

927
00:31:24,670 --> 00:31:26,340
- That was a good one. - Nicely done.

928
00:31:27,140 --> 00:31:28,469
(Only two questions left)

929
00:31:28,470 --> 00:31:30,570
Next question. Cue.

930
00:31:31,140 --> 00:31:33,540
- One, two... - Ha Ji Won.

931
00:31:34,740 --> 00:31:35,780
Incorrect.

932
00:31:37,350 --> 00:31:38,950
(Failed)

933
00:31:38,980 --> 00:31:40,380
The MCs are the problem here.

934
00:31:42,750 --> 00:31:43,919
The MCs are the problem.

935
00:31:43,920 --> 00:31:45,390
(I'm the problem.)

936
00:31:45,990 --> 00:31:47,490
"Hwangjini."

937
00:31:47,990 --> 00:31:49,189
Yeon Seok, "Hwangjini."

938
00:31:49,190 --> 00:31:51,460
She was also in "As One."

939
00:31:51,530 --> 00:31:54,329
You recall one after the time's up.

940
00:31:54,330 --> 00:31:55,370
(Quietly agreeing)

941
00:31:55,530 --> 00:31:57,069
It's our ninth try.

942
00:31:57,070 --> 00:31:58,329
Gosh, Naz...

943
00:31:58,330 --> 00:31:59,469
(Already on their ninth try)

944
00:31:59,470 --> 00:32:01,639
Getting the name is tough enough.

945
00:32:01,640 --> 00:32:02,909
- Even the title. - Right?

946
00:32:02,910 --> 00:32:04,670
We even have to think of a movie title.

947
00:32:05,640 --> 00:32:07,239
How about only guessing...

948
00:32:07,240 --> 00:32:09,050
the title of a movie or a work?

949
00:32:09,410 --> 00:32:10,949
(Who is she discussing with?)

950
00:32:10,950 --> 00:32:12,219
- How about it? - Ask them...

951
00:32:12,220 --> 00:32:13,379
if we could make some changes.

952
00:32:13,380 --> 00:32:15,450
I'm sorry. Got it.

953
00:32:16,090 --> 00:32:17,689
Chae Won stays calm.

954
00:32:17,690 --> 00:32:19,219
- She keeps her calm. - She's good at it.

955
00:32:19,220 --> 00:32:21,119
- Chae Won, let's go for it. - Okay.

956
00:32:21,120 --> 00:32:22,759
Let's pass it with a drama.

957
00:32:22,760 --> 00:32:23,790
Okay.

958
00:32:23,860 --> 00:32:24,889
- Here we go! - Here we go!

959
00:32:24,890 --> 00:32:26,830
Question. Cue.

960
00:32:27,760 --> 00:32:29,530
One, two, three.

961
00:32:29,800 --> 00:32:31,000
Lee Dong Wook,

962
00:32:31,200 --> 00:32:32,680
"Guardian: The Lonely and Great God."

963
00:32:35,040 --> 00:32:36,509
- She's good. - Thank goodness.

964
00:32:36,510 --> 00:32:37,540
Ready.

965
00:32:39,240 --> 00:32:40,540
Next question. Cue.

966
00:32:41,740 --> 00:32:43,380
- One... - Son Ye Jin, "No Other Choice."

967
00:32:45,820 --> 00:32:48,549
"No Other Choice" works for almost...

968
00:32:48,550 --> 00:32:50,119
every actor and actress.

969
00:32:50,120 --> 00:32:52,820
If you can't recall anything, say...

970
00:32:53,160 --> 00:32:54,536
- "No Other Choice." - You're right.

971
00:32:54,560 --> 00:32:55,930
I should have one in mind.

972
00:32:56,660 --> 00:32:58,259
We must send her to Jeju Island.

973
00:32:58,260 --> 00:32:59,430
- Of course. - Absolutely.

974
00:33:00,060 --> 00:33:01,760
(Next is Yeon Seok with the quiz jitters.)

975
00:33:03,500 --> 00:33:04,530
Cue.

976
00:33:04,870 --> 00:33:06,299
- One, two... - Ha Jung Woo,

977
00:33:06,300 --> 00:33:07,970
"Fasten Your Seatbelt."

978
00:33:08,200 --> 00:33:09,240
Nice one.

979
00:33:09,410 --> 00:33:11,740
- It's once again Jae Suk. - Hold on.

980
00:33:11,970 --> 00:33:13,509
- Please be Sang Woo. - SBS's face.

981
00:33:13,510 --> 00:33:14,739
Please be Sang Woo.

982
00:33:14,740 --> 00:33:16,386
(The last player is the face of SBS and Whenever Possible.)

983
00:33:16,410 --> 00:33:17,879
(A success if he passes)

984
00:33:17,880 --> 00:33:20,220
- Ready. Question. Cue. - Please be Sang Woo.

985
00:33:21,020 --> 00:33:24,550
- One, two, three. - Suzy.

986
00:33:25,790 --> 00:33:27,520
(The movie with me in it!)

987
00:33:28,120 --> 00:33:29,660
(With you?)

988
00:33:30,060 --> 00:33:31,130
- Three. - Suzy,

989
00:33:32,330 --> 00:33:33,360
"When the Phone Rings."

990
00:33:34,000 --> 00:33:35,000
"When the Phone Rings."

991
00:33:35,600 --> 00:33:37,480
- No, "Architecture 101." - "Architecture 101."

992
00:33:38,200 --> 00:33:39,740
The MC is the problem here!

993
00:33:40,140 --> 00:33:41,140
"When the Phone Rings?"

994
00:33:41,240 --> 00:33:43,400
- Why "When the Phone Rings?" - The MC is the problem.

995
00:33:43,470 --> 00:33:45,709
Really, why "When the Phone Rings?"

996
00:33:45,710 --> 00:33:48,710
It's okay. Please wipe your tears.

997
00:33:49,450 --> 00:33:50,750
(Shocked)

998
00:33:51,280 --> 00:33:53,949
(After talking so much about the Gangnam senior)

999
00:33:53,950 --> 00:33:55,520
Why "When the Phone Rings?"

1000
00:33:56,590 --> 00:33:59,690
Chae Won's eyes became so big.

1001
00:34:01,620 --> 00:34:02,660
Goodness.

1002
00:34:02,790 --> 00:34:05,289
This time, going last is a bit...

1003
00:34:05,290 --> 00:34:07,359
- Is it too much pressure? - Yes.

1004
00:34:07,360 --> 00:34:08,529
- How about going second? - Second?

1005
00:34:08,530 --> 00:34:09,669
- Yes. - Second?

1006
00:34:09,670 --> 00:34:11,229
- Okay, I'll go second. - Good.

1007
00:34:11,230 --> 00:34:13,039
- Please go last. - Okay, I'll go last.

1008
00:34:13,040 --> 00:34:14,640
- Go last, Sang Woo. - Got it. The last.

1009
00:34:14,840 --> 00:34:16,509
- I'm sorry, Naz. - No.

1010
00:34:16,510 --> 00:34:17,670
I'll try my best.

1011
00:34:17,910 --> 00:34:19,579
- Let's do this. - Let's do this.

1012
00:34:19,580 --> 00:34:21,009
- Let's do this. - In 1, 2, 3.

1013
00:34:21,010 --> 00:34:22,010
- Let's go! - Let's go!

1014
00:34:22,550 --> 00:34:23,649
The last try.

1015
00:34:23,650 --> 00:34:25,650
(Out of 10 total tries, they're on try number 10.)

1016
00:34:26,320 --> 00:34:29,349
(Will they be able to overcome this awful quiz jitters?)

1017
00:34:29,350 --> 00:34:30,620
We must succeed this time.

1018
00:34:34,360 --> 00:34:35,860
Question. Cue.

1019
00:34:36,560 --> 00:34:38,330
One, two, three.

1020
00:34:38,630 --> 00:34:40,430
Lee Jung Eun, "Parasite."

1021
00:34:41,230 --> 00:34:42,299
She's good.

1022
00:34:42,300 --> 00:34:43,630
- How calm. - Good job.

1023
00:34:43,800 --> 00:34:44,969
- How calm. - Good job.

1024
00:34:44,970 --> 00:34:46,669
- Now, it's my turn. - How calm.

1025
00:34:46,670 --> 00:34:48,400
- I'm the problem. - Question. Cue.

1026
00:34:49,540 --> 00:34:51,110
- One... - Hyun Bin.

1027
00:34:53,880 --> 00:34:54,940
- Hyun Bin. - Yes.

1028
00:34:55,550 --> 00:34:56,649
"No Other Choice?"

1029
00:34:56,650 --> 00:34:58,110
(Incorrect)

1030
00:34:58,210 --> 00:34:59,219
"No Other Choice?"

1031
00:34:59,220 --> 00:35:00,619
(Failed the last try)

1032
00:35:00,620 --> 00:35:02,550
- That's what Hyun Bin's wife is in. - Hold on.

1033
00:35:03,020 --> 00:35:04,250
Hyun Bin's wife, okay?

1034
00:35:05,490 --> 00:35:07,420
- The recent... - "Crash Landing on You."

1035
00:35:07,460 --> 00:35:09,960
- "Made in Korea." Seriously. - Well...

1036
00:35:12,760 --> 00:35:14,329
You really are helpless, Jae Suk.

1037
00:35:14,330 --> 00:35:15,630
Goodness.

1038
00:35:16,000 --> 00:35:18,730
He was even in "Harbin."

1039
00:35:19,070 --> 00:35:20,200
Why couldn't I recall any?

1040
00:35:21,100 --> 00:35:22,909
- Could you not recall any? - No.

1041
00:35:22,910 --> 00:35:24,269
This is bad. It's like he's in a black hole.

1042
00:35:24,270 --> 00:35:25,440
Really, "Harbin."

1043
00:35:26,380 --> 00:35:27,609
(Failed with no other choice)

1044
00:35:27,610 --> 00:35:29,080
The recent "Made in Korea."

1045
00:35:29,680 --> 00:35:30,780
It's okay.

1046
00:35:31,950 --> 00:35:33,880
- Is it over? Just like this? - Yes.

1047
00:35:34,220 --> 00:35:35,789
- Is it over? - Yes, it's over.

1048
00:35:35,790 --> 00:35:36,850
Oh, dear.

1049
00:35:37,020 --> 00:35:38,189
It's coming to me now.

1050
00:35:38,190 --> 00:35:40,819
All of the titles are coming to me now.

1051
00:35:40,820 --> 00:35:42,220
(Over without even passing Round 1)

1052
00:35:42,560 --> 00:35:43,560
This is bad.

1053
00:35:43,760 --> 00:35:45,490
- Thank you. - Our apologies, Naz.

1054
00:35:45,700 --> 00:35:47,099
And you've come all the way from Iran.

1055
00:35:47,100 --> 00:35:49,300
No, it's okay. Even this is priceless.

1056
00:35:50,070 --> 00:35:51,629
Meeting someone in the same industry...

1057
00:35:51,630 --> 00:35:53,840
- Yes, industry. - was a great pleasure.

1058
00:35:54,440 --> 00:35:56,939
- Likewise. - If we ever meet while working,

1059
00:35:56,940 --> 00:35:58,839
- let's greet each other. - Of course.

1060
00:35:58,840 --> 00:36:00,010
We'll take our leave now.

1061
00:36:00,380 --> 00:36:01,439
- Thank you. - Happy New Year.

1062
00:36:01,440 --> 00:36:03,350
- Happy New Year. - Happy New Year.

1063
00:36:03,550 --> 00:36:04,710
Thank you.

1064
00:36:05,980 --> 00:36:08,990
(Leaving very solemnly)

1065
00:36:10,520 --> 00:36:13,120
(Gloomy)

1066
00:36:14,020 --> 00:36:15,320
It's warmer than earlier.

1067
00:36:16,430 --> 00:36:17,660
I feel colder.

1068
00:36:19,760 --> 00:36:22,370
- Unfortunately, we failed. - All right.

1069
00:36:22,570 --> 00:36:23,929
I'll prove myself...

1070
00:36:23,930 --> 00:36:25,299
- in our next location. - Okay.

1071
00:36:25,300 --> 00:36:26,499
I totally will.

1072
00:36:26,500 --> 00:36:28,939
- For now, let's head down. - The bus?

1073
00:36:28,940 --> 00:36:31,270
- I feel quite uneasy. - How come?

1074
00:36:31,840 --> 00:36:33,440
- Why? - Right now...

1075
00:36:34,010 --> 00:36:35,539
- We couldn't succeed... - Right.

1076
00:36:35,540 --> 00:36:37,210
I feel so bad for Naz.

1077
00:36:40,920 --> 00:36:43,019
- Chae Won answered very calmly. - Yes.

1078
00:36:43,020 --> 00:36:44,349
- For real. - You were good.

1079
00:36:44,350 --> 00:36:46,289
- Really? - Yes, you did well.

1080
00:36:46,290 --> 00:36:48,190
- Chae Won. - I wanted us to succeed.

1081
00:36:48,290 --> 00:36:49,929
Wanting to guess quickly...

1082
00:36:49,930 --> 00:36:51,929
- turns my brain... - It's tough.

1083
00:36:51,930 --> 00:36:53,159
- into mush. - It goes blank.

1084
00:36:53,160 --> 00:36:54,260
That was a tough one.

1085
00:36:54,500 --> 00:36:57,870
In our second location, without fail...

1086
00:36:58,500 --> 00:36:59,669
Without fail. I swear.

1087
00:36:59,670 --> 00:37:01,340
- Without fail. - Yes.

1088
00:37:01,740 --> 00:37:02,940
- By the way, - Yes?

1089
00:37:03,340 --> 00:37:05,470
- what are we having for lunch? - Lunch.

1090
00:37:05,780 --> 00:37:07,010
What are you feeling?

1091
00:37:07,140 --> 00:37:09,379
Something warm since the weather is cold.

1092
00:37:09,380 --> 00:37:11,110
- Something warm? - Something warm?

1093
00:37:11,350 --> 00:37:12,419
- Yes. - Okay.

1094
00:37:12,420 --> 00:37:14,980
- Like udon. - Udon.

1095
00:37:15,180 --> 00:37:16,420
Something with a warm soup.

1096
00:37:17,050 --> 00:37:18,949
- I know a noodle place. - Maybe hot pot.

1097
00:37:18,950 --> 00:37:20,860
- I like noodles. - I'm in.

1098
00:37:20,960 --> 00:37:22,019
- Andong noodles. - Let's go to that place.

1099
00:37:22,020 --> 00:37:23,429
- They also serve meat. - Yes, let's go.

1100
00:37:23,430 --> 00:37:24,990
- Noodles. - Noodles.

1101
00:37:25,700 --> 00:37:27,500
- Let's take Bus 4211 here. - Okay.

1102
00:37:27,760 --> 00:37:30,199
- Take a seat over there. - Got it.

1103
00:37:30,200 --> 00:37:31,899
- The seat is heated. - Thank you.

1104
00:37:31,900 --> 00:37:33,900
- Is it warm? - If only the poster...

1105
00:37:34,270 --> 00:37:35,600
were of Jun Ji Hyun.

1106
00:37:36,840 --> 00:37:37,986
- Jun Ji Hyun. - It'll come any minute.

1107
00:37:38,010 --> 00:37:39,740
- "Tazza." - My apologies, Ji Hyun.

1108
00:37:40,910 --> 00:37:42,010
I'm sorry, Ji Hyun.

1109
00:37:42,710 --> 00:37:44,049
I feel sorry for Naz as well.

1110
00:37:44,050 --> 00:37:46,949
I'm just so sorry.

1111
00:37:46,950 --> 00:37:48,519
- It was so... - I'm so...

1112
00:37:48,520 --> 00:37:50,250
- She was so happy earlier. - I know.

1113
00:37:50,790 --> 00:37:51,890
It's so cold.

1114
00:37:53,560 --> 00:37:55,659
- You look cold. - I feel cold inside.

1115
00:37:55,660 --> 00:37:57,506
(They're cold on the outside and inside today.)

1116
00:37:57,530 --> 00:37:59,600
- Here it comes. - There it is.

1117
00:38:00,130 --> 00:38:01,730
- All right. - Let's get going.

1118
00:38:02,000 --> 00:38:03,000
Hello.

1119
00:38:03,500 --> 00:38:04,970
- Get on. - Hello.

1120
00:38:05,770 --> 00:38:07,670
(They sit in the same row.)

1121
00:38:08,170 --> 00:38:10,369
(Looking around)

1122
00:38:10,370 --> 00:38:13,280
The people on the bus are pretty quiet.

1123
00:38:13,340 --> 00:38:15,110
Most people stay quiet.

1124
00:38:16,350 --> 00:38:18,380
(He can't wait to talk to them.)

1125
00:38:20,480 --> 00:38:21,550
Hello.

1126
00:38:21,650 --> 00:38:22,950
Hello.

1127
00:38:23,920 --> 00:38:25,650
(Laughing)

1128
00:38:26,020 --> 00:38:27,459
Where did you go so early in the morning?

1129
00:38:27,460 --> 00:38:29,889
- To my girlfriend's place. - Your girlfriend's place?

1130
00:38:29,890 --> 00:38:31,390
She sent you off too early, no?

1131
00:38:33,030 --> 00:38:34,399
- We spent New Year's together. - Oh, New Year's.

1132
00:38:34,400 --> 00:38:35,400
What are you doing?

1133
00:38:35,401 --> 00:38:37,029
- If you spent the night together... - They watched the sunrise.

1134
00:38:37,030 --> 00:38:38,129
- Yes. - The sunrise.

1135
00:38:38,130 --> 00:38:39,599
- Really? - Yes.

1136
00:38:39,600 --> 00:38:42,709
The movie starring these two was recently released.

1137
00:38:42,710 --> 00:38:43,939
- Oh, really? - It's called "Heartman."

1138
00:38:43,940 --> 00:38:45,039
It's a great movie to watch with a girlfriend.

1139
00:38:45,040 --> 00:38:46,309
Yes, as a couple...

1140
00:38:46,310 --> 00:38:48,270
- You'll keep dating her until then? - Of course.

1141
00:38:49,580 --> 00:38:51,250
(It's right up his alley.)

1142
00:38:51,610 --> 00:38:53,079
- Sure. - Good.

1143
00:38:53,080 --> 00:38:54,080
(Glancing)

1144
00:38:55,820 --> 00:38:57,590
- Hello, ma'am. - Sang Woo is so...

1145
00:38:57,990 --> 00:38:59,120
Where are you headed?

1146
00:38:59,390 --> 00:39:01,959
I knew you were too pretty.

1147
00:39:01,960 --> 00:39:03,390
- Really? - You're beautiful.

1148
00:39:03,560 --> 00:39:06,830
- Thank you. You're also beautiful. - He has great communication skills.

1149
00:39:07,600 --> 00:39:08,660
To the bank?

1150
00:39:09,870 --> 00:39:11,176
Where are you going in this cold weather?

1151
00:39:11,200 --> 00:39:12,540
I'm on my way to eat.

1152
00:39:13,200 --> 00:39:14,400
(Smiling brightly)

1153
00:39:15,500 --> 00:39:17,710
It's so funny how he communicates with people.

1154
00:39:18,440 --> 00:39:19,739
- Shall we get off? - Yes.

1155
00:39:19,740 --> 00:39:21,340
(They arrive in no time.)

1156
00:39:22,710 --> 00:39:24,249
- Let's go straight into the alley. - Where?

1157
00:39:24,250 --> 00:39:25,350
- Shall we? - We shall.

1158
00:39:27,120 --> 00:39:28,479
- I see it there. - There it is.

1159
00:39:28,480 --> 00:39:29,849
- That's the one. - Is that it?

1160
00:39:29,850 --> 00:39:31,519
- Oh, it's this place? - Yes.

1161
00:39:31,520 --> 00:39:33,990
It's been so long since the last time I visited.

1162
00:39:34,560 --> 00:39:35,800
- Gosh. - It must be delicious.

1163
00:39:36,260 --> 00:39:37,929
- Hello. - Hello.

1164
00:39:37,930 --> 00:39:39,429
- Oh, hi. Long time no see. - Hello.

1165
00:39:39,430 --> 00:39:41,460
- I haven't been here in a while. - Right.

1166
00:39:41,560 --> 00:39:43,200
(Seated)

1167
00:39:43,730 --> 00:39:45,370
Suyuk or...

1168
00:39:45,470 --> 00:39:47,040
- Do you want suyuk? - Or pancakes.

1169
00:39:47,670 --> 00:39:49,630
Eat whatever you want. I'm fine with all of them.

1170
00:39:50,440 --> 00:39:51,440
Should we get pancakes?

1171
00:39:51,840 --> 00:39:52,879
- Pancakes? - Pancakes.

1172
00:39:52,880 --> 00:39:53,939
- And a small plate of suyuk. - Okay.

1173
00:39:53,940 --> 00:39:55,279
- Okay. - Then...

1174
00:39:55,280 --> 00:39:57,280
They have three different types of noodles.

1175
00:39:57,380 --> 00:39:59,179
Right. I don't know what the difference is.

1176
00:39:59,180 --> 00:40:00,279
This one's made of wheat.

1177
00:40:00,280 --> 00:40:01,350
Domestic wheat.

1178
00:40:02,080 --> 00:40:03,249
Do you want Andong noodles?

1179
00:40:03,250 --> 00:40:04,319
- Yes. - Me too.

1180
00:40:04,320 --> 00:40:05,919
The restaurant's name is Andong, so I should eat that.

1181
00:40:05,920 --> 00:40:07,360
- Andong noodles. - Andong noodles.

1182
00:40:07,590 --> 00:40:09,589
- I'll try wheat noodles. - Sure. Try that.

1183
00:40:09,590 --> 00:40:11,259
Wheat noodles, three Andong noodles,

1184
00:40:11,260 --> 00:40:13,199
one small suyuk, and one small pancake.

1185
00:40:13,200 --> 00:40:14,929
- Is that all? - Yes. Thank you, sir.

1186
00:40:14,930 --> 00:40:16,100
Thank you for coming.

1187
00:40:16,430 --> 00:40:17,599
- I think... - It was so...

1188
00:40:17,600 --> 00:40:18,930
After this shoot,

1189
00:40:19,200 --> 00:40:21,080
I'll feel much more comfortable with Yeon Seok.

1190
00:40:21,200 --> 00:40:22,269
Of course.

1191
00:40:22,270 --> 00:40:24,670
We used to awkwardly say hi when we walked by.

1192
00:40:25,240 --> 00:40:26,340
Please feel at ease.

1193
00:40:26,480 --> 00:40:29,109
By playing games together,

1194
00:40:29,110 --> 00:40:31,249
- I feel comradeship. - You get closer.

1195
00:40:31,250 --> 00:40:32,879
- I think that's actually true. - Yes.

1196
00:40:32,880 --> 00:40:34,520
We rarely get a chance to talk like this.

1197
00:40:34,580 --> 00:40:37,250
But if we play like today, it might get...

1198
00:40:37,690 --> 00:40:38,789
a little awkward.

1199
00:40:38,790 --> 00:40:40,689
But it's...

1200
00:40:40,690 --> 00:40:42,459
"Tazza" was...

1201
00:40:42,460 --> 00:40:43,759
Right. "Tazza."

1202
00:40:43,760 --> 00:40:45,029
Please be a big player today.

1203
00:40:45,030 --> 00:40:46,999
They tried to help by telling me...

1204
00:40:47,000 --> 00:40:49,470
to say "No Other Choice" when I had no clue.

1205
00:40:49,700 --> 00:40:51,200
That's why I said that.

1206
00:40:52,770 --> 00:40:55,000
(I had no other choice.)

1207
00:40:55,700 --> 00:40:57,510
You think of the answer when it's over.

1208
00:40:57,610 --> 00:40:58,640
Yes, when it's over.

1209
00:40:59,010 --> 00:41:00,180
Do you usually cook?

1210
00:41:01,040 --> 00:41:02,910
I sometimes do,

1211
00:41:03,610 --> 00:41:04,680
but I'm too lazy.

1212
00:41:04,980 --> 00:41:06,920
That means you can't cook.

1213
00:41:07,150 --> 00:41:08,150
Right.

1214
00:41:10,150 --> 00:41:11,189
That looks good.

1215
00:41:11,190 --> 00:41:12,619
- Thank you so much. - Look at the color.

1216
00:41:12,620 --> 00:41:13,789
(And hot pancakes)

1217
00:41:13,790 --> 00:41:15,190
- Enjoy your food. - Thank you.

1218
00:41:15,560 --> 00:41:17,129
- It's so... - The perfect food in this weather.

1219
00:41:17,130 --> 00:41:18,159
Ordering suyuk was the right choice.

1220
00:41:18,160 --> 00:41:20,040
- It's perfect. - Now, that's what I call beef.

1221
00:41:24,400 --> 00:41:25,430
It's really good.

1222
00:41:26,200 --> 00:41:28,040
- Try the lungs. - Lungs.

1223
00:41:28,370 --> 00:41:29,570
Goodness.

1224
00:41:29,740 --> 00:41:31,310
I've never tried lungs before.

1225
00:41:33,380 --> 00:41:34,880
- You tried one, right? - I did.

1226
00:41:35,240 --> 00:41:36,549
- Do you mind? - Eat up.

1227
00:41:36,550 --> 00:41:37,750
(Acting nonchalant)

1228
00:41:38,280 --> 00:41:40,119
It's good to have a junior who's assertive.

1229
00:41:40,120 --> 00:41:41,150
It's great.

1230
00:41:43,450 --> 00:41:44,949
- The lung pancake is good. - Do you like it?

1231
00:41:44,950 --> 00:41:46,020
Yes.

1232
00:41:47,260 --> 00:41:49,729
(Laughing)

1233
00:41:49,730 --> 00:41:51,930
It all adds up later.

1234
00:41:52,330 --> 00:41:54,130
He treats me this way here,

1235
00:41:54,430 --> 00:41:57,300
and I take it out on Jee Seok Jin on "Running Man."

1236
00:42:00,870 --> 00:42:03,309
If Yeon Seok has time, we'd love to have him...

1237
00:42:03,310 --> 00:42:05,409
- at the movie preview. - When is it?

1238
00:42:05,410 --> 00:42:07,510
I should watch "Heartman."

1239
00:42:07,610 --> 00:42:09,580
I've been promoting our movie with Chae Won,

1240
00:42:10,310 --> 00:42:13,350
and when we first watched it in the technical screening...

1241
00:42:13,580 --> 00:42:14,650
What did you think?

1242
00:42:14,820 --> 00:42:16,790
- We were both satisfied. - Okay.

1243
00:42:17,120 --> 00:42:18,650
So, I told her,

1244
00:42:18,720 --> 00:42:20,190
"In my mind."

1245
00:42:20,920 --> 00:42:22,929
- He said it was already a success. - "it's already a successful movie."

1246
00:42:22,930 --> 00:42:24,090
How would you rate it?

1247
00:42:24,190 --> 00:42:26,499
- I... - Out of 100 points,

1248
00:42:26,500 --> 00:42:27,999
you said it was 98 points or so.

1249
00:42:28,000 --> 00:42:30,870
- That's huge. - I absolutely loved it.

1250
00:42:31,270 --> 00:42:33,310
We're confident that it'll do well in the theaters.

1251
00:42:34,070 --> 00:42:36,710
- If you're that confident... - Yes.

1252
00:42:36,770 --> 00:42:39,840
But we don't know what the viewers will choose.

1253
00:42:40,040 --> 00:42:42,040
So, we're doing our best to promote it.

1254
00:42:42,310 --> 00:42:46,079
I think comedy movies are doing pretty well nowadays.

1255
00:42:46,080 --> 00:42:47,679
- They're doing well. - And he's good at it.

1256
00:42:47,680 --> 00:42:49,350
- Definitely. - I'm not that good.

1257
00:42:49,650 --> 00:42:51,419
- These are Andong noodles. - He's so skilled.

1258
00:42:51,420 --> 00:42:52,820
- Thank you. - Earlier...

1259
00:42:53,120 --> 00:42:54,419
- It looks tasty. - Eat up.

1260
00:42:54,420 --> 00:42:56,060
- Thank you. - Really?

1261
00:42:56,430 --> 00:42:57,790
The noodles are so silky.

1262
00:42:58,060 --> 00:43:00,730
- It all comes down to the taste. - That's right.

1263
00:43:02,060 --> 00:43:04,130
It looks scrumptious.

1264
00:43:04,800 --> 00:43:06,280
The noodles taste good by themselves.

1265
00:43:10,340 --> 00:43:11,540
It's so tasty.

1266
00:43:12,940 --> 00:43:15,309
I think Yeon Seok knows a lot of good restaurants.

1267
00:43:15,310 --> 00:43:17,609
- He does. - When we shot a movie in the past,

1268
00:43:17,610 --> 00:43:19,480
he'd take us to good restaurants.

1269
00:43:19,920 --> 00:43:22,479
I normally go, even if they're far away.

1270
00:43:22,480 --> 00:43:23,489
Yes,

1271
00:43:23,490 --> 00:43:25,026
- Even if you have to wait in line. - he tends to do that.

1272
00:43:25,050 --> 00:43:26,490
Even if I have to wait.

1273
00:43:27,120 --> 00:43:29,789
- But Jae Suk likes eating fast. - So do I.

1274
00:43:29,790 --> 00:43:32,160
- I eat whatever's in front of me. - Me too.

1275
00:43:32,530 --> 00:43:34,050
There's that downside to being single.

1276
00:43:34,160 --> 00:43:36,970
I prefer hot food rather than delivered food,

1277
00:43:37,200 --> 00:43:38,700
so I normally go out.

1278
00:43:39,700 --> 00:43:41,000
Because I'm alone,

1279
00:43:41,700 --> 00:43:43,809
I'm hesitant when the restaurant is crowded,

1280
00:43:43,810 --> 00:43:45,139
and I come back out.

1281
00:43:45,140 --> 00:43:46,880
How far can you go with eating alone?

1282
00:43:47,480 --> 00:43:48,839
I've tried everything, so...

1283
00:43:48,840 --> 00:43:51,109
- Even a barbecue place? - Yes.

1284
00:43:51,110 --> 00:43:52,249
(He can eat alone at a barbecue restaurant.)

1285
00:43:52,250 --> 00:43:53,419
- That means you can go anywhere. - Right.

1286
00:43:53,420 --> 00:43:54,519
But here's what he means.

1287
00:43:54,520 --> 00:43:56,589
- When it's crowded. - When it's too popular,

1288
00:43:56,590 --> 00:43:58,349
- it's hard to walk in alone. - It gets embarrassing.

1289
00:43:58,350 --> 00:44:00,920
I sometimes walk around it and end up going home for ramyeon.

1290
00:44:03,590 --> 00:44:05,189
- That's so... - That's so sad.

1291
00:44:05,190 --> 00:44:06,660
It's so sad.

1292
00:44:07,000 --> 00:44:09,670
Chae Won, you like visiting good restaurants, right?

1293
00:44:09,970 --> 00:44:12,199
- I do. - I remember...

1294
00:44:12,200 --> 00:44:13,569
going to Jangheung with you.

1295
00:44:13,570 --> 00:44:16,000
We had beef, and you're supposed to cook it quickly,

1296
00:44:16,470 --> 00:44:19,410
but I had visited a different samhap place the day before.

1297
00:44:19,540 --> 00:44:21,409
I told her, "Apparently, this is how you're supposed to eat it,"

1298
00:44:21,410 --> 00:44:23,250
and cooked it longer.

1299
00:44:23,580 --> 00:44:25,649
But it was good, though.

1300
00:44:25,650 --> 00:44:27,019
(There's one man waiting for his wheat noodles.)

1301
00:44:27,020 --> 00:44:28,150
That samhap...

1302
00:44:29,350 --> 00:44:31,819
It's an analogue vibe.

1303
00:44:31,820 --> 00:44:33,359
(He's busy talking instead of eating.)

1304
00:44:33,360 --> 00:44:35,189
I didn't know your food hadn't arrived yet.

1305
00:44:35,190 --> 00:44:37,790
I think they just started making wheat noodles.

1306
00:44:38,390 --> 00:44:40,360
Maybe they just started harvesting it.

1307
00:44:40,700 --> 00:44:42,060
They just...

1308
00:44:42,970 --> 00:44:45,300
Oh, that's why you kept talking to us instead of eating.

1309
00:44:46,800 --> 00:44:48,799
We were trying to eat, and you kept talking to us.

1310
00:44:48,800 --> 00:44:50,339
Come on, Jae Suk.

1311
00:44:50,340 --> 00:44:52,369
- I didn't know. - Don't eat too fast.

1312
00:44:52,370 --> 00:44:54,080
- Slow down. - We're almost finished now.

1313
00:44:54,180 --> 00:44:55,410
Slow down.

1314
00:44:56,410 --> 00:44:58,880
- You're enjoying it so much. - I'll eat slowly.

1315
00:45:00,780 --> 00:45:03,689
Sang Woo, did you turn 50 this year?

1316
00:45:03,690 --> 00:45:04,719
Yes.

1317
00:45:04,720 --> 00:45:07,060
In my 40s,

1318
00:45:07,560 --> 00:45:09,190
I felt a sense of emptiness.

1319
00:45:09,690 --> 00:45:12,130
But now that I turned 50, I feel more generous.

1320
00:45:12,530 --> 00:45:15,200
- I see. - And I'm unaffected by things.

1321
00:45:15,330 --> 00:45:16,330
That's true.

1322
00:45:16,700 --> 00:45:18,370
But I care about our movie doing well.

1323
00:45:20,770 --> 00:45:24,040
I care about winning these games.

1324
00:45:25,110 --> 00:45:27,080
I'm normally unaffected by those things.

1325
00:45:27,410 --> 00:45:29,749
Like, "If I'm 50, I'm 50. If I'm 60, then I'm 60."

1326
00:45:29,750 --> 00:45:31,050
- "So what?" - Exactly.

1327
00:45:31,480 --> 00:45:32,509
- You are... - "So what?"

1328
00:45:32,510 --> 00:45:33,579
"What are you going to do about it?"

1329
00:45:33,580 --> 00:45:35,350
- It's like... - "So what?"

1330
00:45:36,350 --> 00:45:37,350
- But... - It sometimes bothers you.

1331
00:45:37,351 --> 00:45:38,850
Is your food still not here?

1332
00:45:40,560 --> 00:45:41,560
(Empty)

1333
00:45:41,561 --> 00:45:44,289
- I think... - You should... How about this?

1334
00:45:44,290 --> 00:45:45,430
Just get your food to go.

1335
00:45:46,200 --> 00:45:47,200
Jae Suk.

1336
00:45:47,300 --> 00:45:48,430
What could be the problem?

1337
00:45:48,560 --> 00:45:50,040
They're making the noodles right now.

1338
00:45:51,500 --> 00:45:52,570
Or...

1339
00:45:52,830 --> 00:45:54,150
should we play a game in advance?

1340
00:45:54,200 --> 00:45:55,669
Like what? To decide who pays?

1341
00:45:55,670 --> 00:45:57,469
- Should we play that now? - I'd like that.

1342
00:45:57,470 --> 00:45:58,569
Let's play...

1343
00:45:58,570 --> 00:45:59,979
- Good. - before my food gets here.

1344
00:45:59,980 --> 00:46:00,980
Sounds good.

1345
00:46:02,180 --> 00:46:04,350
- Will it be around 50 dollars? - How about...

1346
00:46:04,410 --> 00:46:05,979
- A game using AI? - Not ChatGPT.

1347
00:46:05,980 --> 00:46:07,179
Let's try using Gemini. What do you say?

1348
00:46:07,180 --> 00:46:08,419
- Sure. How do we play it? - How?

1349
00:46:08,420 --> 00:46:09,720
You just talk to her.

1350
00:46:10,690 --> 00:46:13,690
We need to play a game to decide who pays for lunch.

1351
00:46:13,890 --> 00:46:16,260
Sure thing. List the candidates.

1352
00:46:16,460 --> 00:46:18,589
I'll carefully pick one.

1353
00:46:18,590 --> 00:46:21,360
My name is Yeon Seok.

1354
00:46:22,970 --> 00:46:25,430
Oh, Yeon Seok, you're our first candidate.

1355
00:46:25,600 --> 00:46:27,299
Your name sounds reliable,

1356
00:46:27,300 --> 00:46:28,840
and it screams, "It's on me today."

1357
00:46:31,270 --> 00:46:33,039
- Careful. - My food isn't even here yet.

1358
00:46:33,040 --> 00:46:34,360
Don't you think that's too harsh?

1359
00:46:34,540 --> 00:46:35,540
(Pouting)

1360
00:46:35,541 --> 00:46:38,749
Next, we have Moon Chae Won and Yoo Jae Suk.

1361
00:46:38,750 --> 00:46:40,419
- Sorry for the delay. - No problem.

1362
00:46:40,420 --> 00:46:42,849
- That's fine. - I'm terribly sorry.

1363
00:46:42,850 --> 00:46:45,449
Before you pick one, I'll tell you...

1364
00:46:45,450 --> 00:46:46,620
their distinctive conditions.

1365
00:46:47,090 --> 00:46:50,729
Sang Woo makes great ad-libs today.

1366
00:46:50,730 --> 00:46:52,429
(Candidate 1: Sang Woo with nice ad-libs)

1367
00:46:52,430 --> 00:46:54,959
And Chae Won stayed calm...

1368
00:46:54,960 --> 00:46:56,869
and played her part...

1369
00:46:56,870 --> 00:46:58,929
under this cold weather.

1370
00:46:58,930 --> 00:46:59,939
(Candidate 2: The Calm Queen, Chae Won)

1371
00:46:59,940 --> 00:47:02,099
We all ordered noodles,

1372
00:47:02,100 --> 00:47:03,740
and Yeon Seok's noodles were served last.

1373
00:47:03,970 --> 00:47:05,040
He just started eating.

1374
00:47:05,240 --> 00:47:08,009
- I feel miserable. - That's a foreshadowing of fate.

1375
00:47:08,010 --> 00:47:09,649
- I feel miserable. - Getting your noodles last...

1376
00:47:09,650 --> 00:47:10,979
at a noodles restaurant means...

1377
00:47:10,980 --> 00:47:12,280
two things.

1378
00:47:12,410 --> 00:47:14,679
One, it was made with extra care.

1379
00:47:14,680 --> 00:47:17,720
Two, things are just not working out for you today.

1380
00:47:18,850 --> 00:47:22,420
- I think she's setting me up. - I'll tell you about Jae Suk.

1381
00:47:22,660 --> 00:47:25,860
Things didn't go my way in today's game.

1382
00:47:26,060 --> 00:47:27,499
I'm probably in the worst condition.

1383
00:47:27,500 --> 00:47:30,199
Stop making it learn!

1384
00:47:30,200 --> 00:47:31,729
- You're right. - He's saying it pitifully.

1385
00:47:31,730 --> 00:47:33,899
- You can't say it that way. - Jae Suk,

1386
00:47:33,900 --> 00:47:36,440
you must be going through a lot today.

1387
00:47:36,470 --> 00:47:38,209
- Oh, my. - Hold on.

1388
00:47:38,210 --> 00:47:41,439
- That's not fair. - Everyone, say something.

1389
00:47:41,440 --> 00:47:42,440
Chae Won, say your piece.

1390
00:47:43,750 --> 00:47:47,450
I'm actually wearing short sleeves and short pants under my coat.

1391
00:47:49,750 --> 00:47:52,120
- I was freezing. - Chae Won.

1392
00:47:52,190 --> 00:47:55,090
Considering our tenacity and everything,

1393
00:47:55,160 --> 00:47:56,359
who do you think should pay...

1394
00:47:56,360 --> 00:47:58,159
- for lunch today? - Let's rule one out each time.

1395
00:47:58,160 --> 00:48:00,259
- I've collected all the data. - Tell her to rule one out.

1396
00:48:00,260 --> 00:48:02,099
Considering this dramatic lineup...

1397
00:48:02,100 --> 00:48:04,029
- and the atmosphere, - Hold on.

1398
00:48:04,030 --> 00:48:05,429
- my final decision... - Wait.

1399
00:48:05,430 --> 00:48:07,070
Has to be Sang Woo.

1400
00:48:07,140 --> 00:48:08,600
- Wait. - What?

1401
00:48:08,800 --> 00:48:10,409
- But... - It's over.

1402
00:48:10,410 --> 00:48:11,410
- It's over. - Why...

1403
00:48:11,740 --> 00:48:13,639
She told Sang Woo to pay.

1404
00:48:13,640 --> 00:48:15,409
I genuinely wanted to pay.

1405
00:48:15,410 --> 00:48:17,549
- I brought my wallet. - Really?

1406
00:48:17,550 --> 00:48:19,819
You can't input data like that.

1407
00:48:19,820 --> 00:48:20,849
(Jae Suk got out of it by playing the pity card.)

1408
00:48:20,850 --> 00:48:22,490
It's because he's using the free version.

1409
00:48:22,520 --> 00:48:23,960
It's because his AI service is free.

1410
00:48:24,090 --> 00:48:26,390
But I like how simple it is.

1411
00:48:26,720 --> 00:48:28,520
- Thanks for the food. - Thanks for the food.

1412
00:48:29,190 --> 00:48:31,530
You seem much more relaxed as you eat now.

1413
00:48:31,990 --> 00:48:32,990
Eat comfortably.

1414
00:48:32,991 --> 00:48:35,160
The cook wanted to serve your food quickly.

1415
00:48:35,600 --> 00:48:36,729
(It's still boiling.)

1416
00:48:36,730 --> 00:48:39,099
- Eat slowly. - They cooked it so fast.

1417
00:48:39,100 --> 00:48:40,300
(He's only eaten three bites.)

1418
00:48:41,170 --> 00:48:44,309
I still can't believe it's already 2026.

1419
00:48:44,310 --> 00:48:46,510
- The year 2025 went by so fast. - Right.

1420
00:48:47,040 --> 00:48:48,240
It was so...

1421
00:48:49,340 --> 00:48:52,209
Older people say that time goes faster...

1422
00:48:52,210 --> 00:48:54,479
as you grow older. Is that true?

1423
00:48:54,480 --> 00:48:55,919
- I think so. - I can totally relate.

1424
00:48:55,920 --> 00:48:57,689
I feel it too.

1425
00:48:57,690 --> 00:49:00,089
- Really? - We have shows every week,

1426
00:49:00,090 --> 00:49:01,960
and we live by the week.

1427
00:49:02,460 --> 00:49:04,359
- Four weeks is a month. - Right.

1428
00:49:04,360 --> 00:49:05,689
- A month goes by faster. - Yes.

1429
00:49:05,690 --> 00:49:07,729
Sang Woo and I both have...

1430
00:49:07,730 --> 00:49:09,029
children who grow,

1431
00:49:09,030 --> 00:49:10,770
and it feels like it's going faster.

1432
00:49:11,500 --> 00:49:13,169
Time goes so slowly when you're at school.

1433
00:49:13,170 --> 00:49:14,200
Definitely.

1434
00:49:14,270 --> 00:49:16,610
When I was at school,

1435
00:49:17,440 --> 00:49:19,410
- I was mostly bored. - Right.

1436
00:49:19,880 --> 00:49:21,979
- There wasn't much to do. - Right. It was boring.

1437
00:49:21,980 --> 00:49:23,679
(Time went especially slow back in school.)

1438
00:49:23,680 --> 00:49:26,350
But my second child is...

1439
00:49:26,920 --> 00:49:28,380
- eight years now. - Yes.

1440
00:49:28,850 --> 00:49:30,150
She's turning nine now.

1441
00:49:30,350 --> 00:49:31,750
I asked her because I was curious.

1442
00:49:31,850 --> 00:49:35,360
"Na Eun, does time go fast or slow for you?"

1443
00:49:36,160 --> 00:49:37,480
She thought for a little while...

1444
00:49:37,530 --> 00:49:38,930
and said, "It goes by so fast."

1445
00:49:39,130 --> 00:49:40,730
- She did? - Yes.

1446
00:49:40,830 --> 00:49:42,160
Even kids say that.

1447
00:49:42,430 --> 00:49:46,370
I reckon things change more drastically nowadays.

1448
00:49:46,440 --> 00:49:48,299
- It's too fast. - Trends...

1449
00:49:48,300 --> 00:49:49,399
change suddenly.

1450
00:49:49,400 --> 00:49:50,709
You're right.

1451
00:49:50,710 --> 00:49:51,710
- They do. - Because...

1452
00:49:51,710 --> 00:49:52,710
the trend cycle is getting shorter?

1453
00:49:52,711 --> 00:49:54,509
- It's way shorter. - So, it feels faster.

1454
00:49:54,510 --> 00:49:56,280
- It's all dynamic now. - Yes.

1455
00:49:56,380 --> 00:49:57,909
- I guess it's relative. - I guess so.

1456
00:49:57,910 --> 00:49:59,790
(Maybe that's why there's never a dull moment.)

1457
00:50:00,180 --> 00:50:01,350
That was a good meal.

1458
00:50:01,580 --> 00:50:02,919
I feel the heat going up.

1459
00:50:02,920 --> 00:50:04,319
(Sang Woo goes as soon as he hears it.)

1460
00:50:04,320 --> 00:50:05,489
Sang Woo.

1461
00:50:05,490 --> 00:50:07,120
Our senior.

1462
00:50:07,690 --> 00:50:08,720
I'll pay.

1463
00:50:09,160 --> 00:50:10,480
- Did you enjoy your food? - Yes.

1464
00:50:11,060 --> 00:50:12,090
I really enjoyed it.

1465
00:50:13,460 --> 00:50:14,859
- Thank you for coming. - Sure.

1466
00:50:14,860 --> 00:50:15,929
(Their souls and bodies are warmer, thanks to the noodles.)

1467
00:50:15,930 --> 00:50:17,870
- Thank you. - Thanks for the food.

1468
00:50:18,470 --> 00:50:19,769
Thanks, Sang Woo.

1469
00:50:19,770 --> 00:50:20,999
- Oh, don't mention it. - Thank you.

1470
00:50:21,000 --> 00:50:22,739
- Thank you for the food. - I haven't seen you in a while,

1471
00:50:22,740 --> 00:50:24,300
and I ended up being treated to a meal.

1472
00:50:25,010 --> 00:50:26,840
I'm the guy that paid for Jae Suk's food.

1473
00:50:28,410 --> 00:50:30,310
I let you treat me to a meal.

1474
00:50:31,510 --> 00:50:32,679
(Looking)

1475
00:50:32,680 --> 00:50:34,150
They have coffee here.

1476
00:50:34,980 --> 00:50:35,980
- And gelato. - It was right next door.

1477
00:50:35,981 --> 00:50:37,389
- Should we check it out? - Yes.

1478
00:50:37,390 --> 00:50:38,889
- Sure. - They also have coffee.

1479
00:50:38,890 --> 00:50:40,920
(They visit a gelato shop as they have time.)

1480
00:50:41,820 --> 00:50:43,690
- Do you have coffee? - Hello.

1481
00:50:44,090 --> 00:50:45,459
- And ice cream. - We only sell...

1482
00:50:45,460 --> 00:50:47,359
Americano.

1483
00:50:47,360 --> 00:50:48,860
(I see.)

1484
00:50:49,100 --> 00:50:50,530
I want to try a gelato.

1485
00:50:50,600 --> 00:50:51,699
Sure.

1486
00:50:51,700 --> 00:50:53,199
(They order one gelato each instead of coffee.)

1487
00:50:53,200 --> 00:50:54,840
Do you want it on a cone or in a cup?

1488
00:50:56,040 --> 00:50:58,410
(Jae Suk is also choosing a flavor.)

1489
00:50:58,570 --> 00:50:59,770
Roasted "pastachio?"

1490
00:51:01,310 --> 00:51:02,410
It's pistachio.

1491
00:51:03,040 --> 00:51:04,760
- It's not a type of pasta. - Golden apple.

1492
00:51:04,850 --> 00:51:06,049
- Golden apple. - It's not a type of pasta.

1493
00:51:06,050 --> 00:51:07,650
- Strawberry. - It's pistachio.

1494
00:51:07,780 --> 00:51:09,280
What do you think about marron?

1495
00:51:09,480 --> 00:51:10,489
- What is that? - It's like a chestnut.

1496
00:51:10,490 --> 00:51:11,720
Oh, I like that.

1497
00:51:12,250 --> 00:51:14,160
- Marron... - I knew you'd like it.

1498
00:51:14,760 --> 00:51:16,590
- Okay. Good. - Okay.

1499
00:51:16,990 --> 00:51:18,059
No.

1500
00:51:18,060 --> 00:51:19,899
Why? Come on, let me pay.

1501
00:51:19,900 --> 00:51:20,930
It's done.

1502
00:51:21,160 --> 00:51:22,376
Sang Woo takes care of everything.

1503
00:51:22,400 --> 00:51:24,370
- Why are you paying for everything? - It's fine.

1504
00:51:24,530 --> 00:51:25,699
That's a New Jerseyan.

1505
00:51:25,700 --> 00:51:27,140
- Indeed. - From New Jersey.

1506
00:51:27,470 --> 00:51:29,910
- I have to work hard this year. - What do I do?

1507
00:51:30,070 --> 00:51:31,170
New Jerseyan.

1508
00:51:31,570 --> 00:51:33,339
(They take seats as they wait for their gelato.)

1509
00:51:33,340 --> 00:51:35,479
Even when I'm inside, the temperature is...

1510
00:51:35,480 --> 00:51:37,509
Right? It's chilly.

1511
00:51:37,510 --> 00:51:39,919
- It's cold today. - Jae Suk.

1512
00:51:39,920 --> 00:51:41,919
- It is cold. - It's not...

1513
00:51:41,920 --> 00:51:44,040
- It's pretty cold today. - what you expected, right?

1514
00:51:44,890 --> 00:51:46,719
I hope we look warm on TV.

1515
00:51:46,720 --> 00:51:48,260
It's cold everywhere today.

1516
00:51:49,320 --> 00:51:50,790
What do you do on your day off?

1517
00:51:51,260 --> 00:51:52,559
- Not much. - Really?

1518
00:51:52,560 --> 00:51:55,359
I stay at home to watch movies or YouTube.

1519
00:51:55,360 --> 00:51:56,629
- I don't do much. - You were...

1520
00:51:56,630 --> 00:51:58,069
often on YouTube, weren't you?

1521
00:51:58,070 --> 00:51:59,429
It's my wife's channel.

1522
00:51:59,430 --> 00:52:01,069
- It's Tae Young's. - My wife has a channel,

1523
00:52:01,070 --> 00:52:02,699
- He's sometimes in those videos. - and when I go to the US,

1524
00:52:02,700 --> 00:52:04,609
I have to make an appearance...

1525
00:52:04,610 --> 00:52:06,439
- since it's my wife's. - I see.

1526
00:52:06,440 --> 00:52:08,780
She films everything and does it on her own.

1527
00:52:09,640 --> 00:52:11,209
I like it, though.

1528
00:52:11,210 --> 00:52:14,719
It could work as an archive of your life.

1529
00:52:14,720 --> 00:52:16,249
It does feel like a family photo album.

1530
00:52:16,250 --> 00:52:18,050
When I'm in Korea by myself,

1531
00:52:18,650 --> 00:52:21,019
I hear my kids in those videos.

1532
00:52:21,020 --> 00:52:23,220
- And you can check on them. - Yes, so it's comforting.

1533
00:52:23,390 --> 00:52:25,589
(Sang Woo's family album in New Jersey)

1534
00:52:25,590 --> 00:52:26,599
(Laughing)

1535
00:52:26,600 --> 00:52:27,830
(Ri Ho's dad seems excited.)

1536
00:52:28,030 --> 00:52:29,030
(I beat my son!)

1537
00:52:29,031 --> 00:52:31,300
(The dad is too happy to beat his son in a game.)

1538
00:52:31,330 --> 00:52:33,440
I told you so. I've still got it.

1539
00:52:33,640 --> 00:52:35,646
- What does this button do? - I'll stop going easy on you.

1540
00:52:35,670 --> 00:52:37,186
- How do I start? - You'll stop going easy?

1541
00:52:37,210 --> 00:52:38,469
Seeing all the old photos...

1542
00:52:38,470 --> 00:52:39,940
- can be tiring. - Right.

1543
00:52:40,310 --> 00:52:42,709
But you can look it up on YouTube, and it's a memory.

1544
00:52:42,710 --> 00:52:44,110
- Because they last. - Yes.

1545
00:52:44,650 --> 00:52:45,650
What do you do on your day off,

1546
00:52:45,650 --> 00:52:46,650
- Chae Won? - What do you do, Chae Won?

1547
00:52:46,651 --> 00:52:48,449
I don't do anything special either.

1548
00:52:48,450 --> 00:52:50,319
- You're a homebody? - But I go out more than you think.

1549
00:52:50,320 --> 00:52:51,349
- Really? - Really?

1550
00:52:51,350 --> 00:52:53,719
- I often visit Gwanghwamun. - Really?

1551
00:52:53,720 --> 00:52:55,889
- Gwanghwamun? - Or Seochon.

1552
00:52:55,890 --> 00:52:57,259
- Gwanghwamun is nice. - For good food?

1553
00:52:57,260 --> 00:52:59,189
- Yes. And coffee shops. - Good restaurants?

1554
00:52:59,190 --> 00:53:00,359
Oh, you go around visiting coffee shops?

1555
00:53:00,360 --> 00:53:01,399
- That's nice. - Yes.

1556
00:53:01,400 --> 00:53:04,399
In Seochon, they remodeled an old post office...

1557
00:53:04,400 --> 00:53:06,869
and opened a coffee shop.

1558
00:53:06,870 --> 00:53:08,939
I visit such unique places.

1559
00:53:08,940 --> 00:53:10,509
(Chae Won likes visiting unique shops.)

1560
00:53:10,510 --> 00:53:11,569
I get around more than you think.

1561
00:53:11,570 --> 00:53:14,179
You do. Gwanghwamun and Seochon.

1562
00:53:14,180 --> 00:53:15,410
Who's your closest friend?

1563
00:53:16,110 --> 00:53:19,979
The cast members of "Flower of Evil" are...

1564
00:53:19,980 --> 00:53:21,279
around the same age.

1565
00:53:21,280 --> 00:53:23,079
I'm the youngest, though.

1566
00:53:23,080 --> 00:53:26,389
Kim Ji Hoon, Seo Hyun Woo, and Lee Joon Gi.

1567
00:53:26,390 --> 00:53:28,060
They're around my age.

1568
00:53:28,260 --> 00:53:29,660
We're only 3 to 4 years apart.

1569
00:53:29,860 --> 00:53:31,359
You must have enjoyed filming "Flower of Evil."

1570
00:53:31,360 --> 00:53:33,460
- Right. - I did.

1571
00:53:33,700 --> 00:53:35,729
"Heartman" was your first work with him.

1572
00:53:35,730 --> 00:53:36,829
- It was. - It was.

1573
00:53:36,830 --> 00:53:37,830
What was he like?

1574
00:53:38,130 --> 00:53:41,199
Sang Woo was...

1575
00:53:41,200 --> 00:53:43,910
the very first celebrity crush of mine.

1576
00:53:44,110 --> 00:53:45,609
- Really? - When I was little.

1577
00:53:45,610 --> 00:53:47,109
- "Stairway to Heaven?" - Yes, "Stairway to Heaven."

1578
00:53:47,110 --> 00:53:48,480
Thanks for saying that.

1579
00:53:48,710 --> 00:53:50,950
Sang Woo actually told me that he was praised so much...

1580
00:53:51,250 --> 00:53:53,779
- when they shot the movie. - Your gelato is ready.

1581
00:53:53,780 --> 00:53:55,119
- Okay. - Of course.

1582
00:53:55,120 --> 00:53:56,120
Thank you.

1583
00:53:56,121 --> 00:53:57,149
This is the cone.

1584
00:53:57,150 --> 00:54:00,389
(The gelati from paradise are served.)

1585
00:54:00,390 --> 00:54:01,910
- This is the rice flavor. - Goodness.

1586
00:54:02,260 --> 00:54:04,160
(Taking a bite right away)

1587
00:54:04,330 --> 00:54:05,760
(Moaning)

1588
00:54:06,260 --> 00:54:07,359
The rice flavor.

1589
00:54:07,360 --> 00:54:10,199
(Although the summer has passed, gelato finds its way back.)

1590
00:54:10,200 --> 00:54:11,300
It's good.

1591
00:54:12,700 --> 00:54:14,370
The cone is so crispy.

1592
00:54:14,540 --> 00:54:15,739
- Is it? - Yes.

1593
00:54:15,740 --> 00:54:17,740
(Enjoying unique winter treats together)

1594
00:54:18,370 --> 00:54:19,570
It's tasty,

1595
00:54:20,840 --> 00:54:22,440
but I'm worried about stepping outside.

1596
00:54:23,340 --> 00:54:25,349
Although we're not saying it,

1597
00:54:25,350 --> 00:54:28,230
- I should have just gotten coffee. - we're all thinking the same thing.

1598
00:54:28,680 --> 00:54:31,350
I should have ordered coffee. I got caught in the moment.

1599
00:54:32,020 --> 00:54:33,619
It's good, though. It's refreshing.

1600
00:54:33,620 --> 00:54:34,620
(Crisp)

1601
00:54:34,621 --> 00:54:35,790
It is good,

1602
00:54:36,360 --> 00:54:37,960
but the problem is when we step outside.

1603
00:54:38,590 --> 00:54:40,529
Can I read the story again?

1604
00:54:40,530 --> 00:54:41,599
Sure.

1605
00:54:41,600 --> 00:54:42,859
- Let's find some hints. - We should...

1606
00:54:42,860 --> 00:54:44,420
- check it out again. - Look for hints.

1607
00:54:44,470 --> 00:54:45,669
Let's find our Whenever Guest.

1608
00:54:45,670 --> 00:54:47,199
- Okay. - Jo Tae Jun.

1609
00:54:47,200 --> 00:54:48,600
- Do you want to read it? - Yes.

1610
00:54:48,840 --> 00:54:51,069
"I'm a dopamine chaser who always needs..."

1611
00:54:51,070 --> 00:54:52,610
"something to be obsessed with."

1612
00:54:52,910 --> 00:54:56,139
"I've obsessed over games to reach the top 0.4-percent,"

1613
00:54:56,140 --> 00:54:58,480
"burned with a competitive spirit to win at love,"

1614
00:54:58,680 --> 00:55:00,219
"and even quit my job at a major corporation..."

1615
00:55:00,220 --> 00:55:01,649
"to chase the sense of achievement."

1616
00:55:01,650 --> 00:55:02,719
Really?

1617
00:55:02,720 --> 00:55:05,550
"But my daily life is just too peaceful now."

1618
00:55:05,690 --> 00:55:07,620
"I'm suffering from a dopamine deficiency."

1619
00:55:08,190 --> 00:55:10,130
"I ask for your emergency prescription."

1620
00:55:11,030 --> 00:55:12,060
Yes.

1621
00:55:12,190 --> 00:55:15,529
They say their daily life is too peaceful.

1622
00:55:15,530 --> 00:55:17,930
Maybe it's not the case when they're at work.

1623
00:55:18,470 --> 00:55:20,000
Maybe their work isn't going so well.

1624
00:55:22,100 --> 00:55:23,500
It could be that type of peace, no?

1625
00:55:24,070 --> 00:55:25,770
- "No?" - Because the economy is bad.

1626
00:55:26,210 --> 00:55:27,709
Sang Woo was on "You Quiz on the Block,"

1627
00:55:27,710 --> 00:55:29,950
and he said one of the things he say the most often was,

1628
00:55:30,480 --> 00:55:31,749
- "No?" - No?

1629
00:55:31,750 --> 00:55:32,949
- Really? - Really?

1630
00:55:32,950 --> 00:55:34,780
What does your wife say the most often?

1631
00:55:35,420 --> 00:55:36,550
"Anyhow."

1632
00:55:36,990 --> 00:55:38,750
- What? - "Anyway" or "anyhow."

1633
00:55:39,050 --> 00:55:41,660
For instance, I say, "Should we go there for dinner?"

1634
00:55:41,760 --> 00:55:42,860
If no one answers,

1635
00:55:43,190 --> 00:55:44,260
I say, "No?"

1636
00:55:45,830 --> 00:55:47,506
You tend to walk on eggshells around others.

1637
00:55:47,530 --> 00:55:48,760
My wife and I are talking,

1638
00:55:49,260 --> 00:55:51,780
and when we have different opinions, she finishes it by saying,

1639
00:55:51,900 --> 00:55:52,929
"Anyhow."

1640
00:55:52,930 --> 00:55:54,169
Who? You?

1641
00:55:54,170 --> 00:55:55,339
No, my wife does.

1642
00:55:55,340 --> 00:55:56,910
- She wraps it up. - "Anyhow."

1643
00:55:57,610 --> 00:55:59,470
"Anyhow." "I don't care."

1644
00:55:59,940 --> 00:56:01,909
- "Whatever." - "I'm doing this."

1645
00:56:01,910 --> 00:56:04,050
"You do whatever you want. Leave me out of it."

1646
00:56:04,650 --> 00:56:07,379
And Sang Woo keeps trying to get confirmation.

1647
00:56:07,380 --> 00:56:08,479
After he voices an opinion...

1648
00:56:08,480 --> 00:56:10,349
- "No, right?" - "No?"

1649
00:56:10,350 --> 00:56:11,849
(To him, it means, "What did I get wrong?")

1650
00:56:11,850 --> 00:56:14,050
- When she's not responding. - I use it the most often.

1651
00:56:14,720 --> 00:56:16,160
What do you often say?

1652
00:56:16,320 --> 00:56:20,030
There's something that my wife often says to me.

1653
00:56:20,360 --> 00:56:21,530
- What is it? - What?

1654
00:56:21,930 --> 00:56:22,959
"Did you hear me?"

1655
00:56:22,960 --> 00:56:25,000
(Did you hear me?)

1656
00:56:27,370 --> 00:56:29,199
- Jae Suk! - "Of course, I did."

1657
00:56:29,200 --> 00:56:30,309
That's hilarious.

1658
00:56:30,310 --> 00:56:31,840
- "Of course, I heard you." - Come on.

1659
00:56:32,040 --> 00:56:33,139
- That's so funny. - "You think I won't?"

1660
00:56:33,140 --> 00:56:34,860
She goes, "Then, why aren't you answering?"

1661
00:56:35,240 --> 00:56:36,849
- I needed time to think. - You needed time.

1662
00:56:36,850 --> 00:56:37,979
To think about that question.

1663
00:56:37,980 --> 00:56:39,480
- Right? - They're all connected.

1664
00:56:39,580 --> 00:56:40,679
"Did you hear what I said?"

1665
00:56:40,680 --> 00:56:42,150
"You said this and that, no?"

1666
00:56:43,220 --> 00:56:44,789
- "Anyhow." - "Anyhow,".

1667
00:56:44,790 --> 00:56:46,270
- She wraps it up. - "do this today."

1668
00:56:46,820 --> 00:56:48,789
- We don't have a choice. - We don't.

1669
00:56:48,790 --> 00:56:50,330
We don't get any choices.

1670
00:56:50,660 --> 00:56:52,189
I asked her even this morning.

1671
00:56:52,190 --> 00:56:53,759
"Kyung Eun, when you ask me a question,"

1672
00:56:53,760 --> 00:56:55,330
"do I get to choose?"

1673
00:56:56,900 --> 00:56:58,469
And she says,

1674
00:56:58,470 --> 00:57:01,069
"Deal with it on your own."

1675
00:57:01,070 --> 00:57:03,039
That means you need to get permission first.

1676
00:57:03,040 --> 00:57:05,070
Exactly. It's the same as saying, "Anyway."

1677
00:57:05,110 --> 00:57:06,880
Anyhow, we should get going...

1678
00:57:07,540 --> 00:57:09,109
- to meet the next guest. - Should we?

1679
00:57:09,110 --> 00:57:10,110
- Let's get going. - Yes.

1680
00:57:10,111 --> 00:57:11,679
(Current time, 12:52pm)

1681
00:57:11,680 --> 00:57:14,450
Maybe it's because we had ice cream, but...

1682
00:57:15,450 --> 00:57:16,549
(It feels even colder.)

1683
00:57:16,550 --> 00:57:17,590
I feel cold on the inside.

1684
00:57:17,920 --> 00:57:19,189
I had never expected this.

1685
00:57:19,190 --> 00:57:20,990
But it's effective in a way.

1686
00:57:21,190 --> 00:57:23,420
You fight cold with cold. Right?

1687
00:57:24,190 --> 00:57:25,936
- You beat the cold with the cold. - Indeed.

1688
00:57:25,960 --> 00:57:27,529
(Navi Yoo starts working.)

1689
00:57:27,530 --> 00:57:29,400
I think it's right across the street.

1690
00:57:29,800 --> 00:57:31,070
I wonder what we'll find.

1691
00:57:32,200 --> 00:57:33,999
They quit their job for it.

1692
00:57:34,000 --> 00:57:35,340
Their daily life is peaceful.

1693
00:57:36,000 --> 00:57:37,270
Too peaceful.

1694
00:57:37,940 --> 00:57:39,340
They're in need of a dopamine rush.

1695
00:57:40,440 --> 00:57:41,879
- They must be bored at work. - Yes.

1696
00:57:41,880 --> 00:57:47,519
I believe that peace and mundaneness are the most important in life.

1697
00:57:47,520 --> 00:57:48,580
That's right.

1698
00:57:49,480 --> 00:57:50,749
(He spots the destination.)

1699
00:57:50,750 --> 00:57:51,889
It's this building.

1700
00:57:51,890 --> 00:57:52,949
- What? - What?

1701
00:57:52,950 --> 00:57:54,189
It really looks like a hospital.

1702
00:57:54,190 --> 00:57:56,510
It's on the second floor. It's an oriental medical clinic.

1703
00:57:56,620 --> 00:57:59,140
- An oriental medical clinic? - Does the guest have a bad back?

1704
00:57:59,530 --> 00:58:00,630
Maybe not.

1705
00:58:02,360 --> 00:58:03,430
Is the guest a patient?

1706
00:58:04,800 --> 00:58:05,830
Jo Tae Jun.

1707
00:58:06,770 --> 00:58:08,976
- What? It's a real clinic. - He quit his job at a corporation.

1708
00:58:09,000 --> 00:58:10,369
- It's an oriental medical clinic. - It's an oriental medical clinic.

1709
00:58:10,370 --> 00:58:11,510
You're right.

1710
00:58:11,640 --> 00:58:13,710
I don't think he's at the oriental medicine clinic.

1711
00:58:14,440 --> 00:58:15,510
Jo Tae Jun.

1712
00:58:17,110 --> 00:58:18,110
I don't think this is the place.

1713
00:58:18,111 --> 00:58:19,579
- Isn't this the place? - Hello.

1714
00:58:19,580 --> 00:58:20,979
- Hello. - Hello.

1715
00:58:20,980 --> 00:58:22,280
- Are you Jo Tae Jun? - Yes.

1716
00:58:22,650 --> 00:58:23,719
- I see. - What?

1717
00:58:23,720 --> 00:58:25,089
You're the doctor.

1718
00:58:25,090 --> 00:58:26,319
- Hello. - You're the doctor.

1719
00:58:26,320 --> 00:58:27,390
It's nice to meet you.

1720
00:58:27,660 --> 00:58:32,290
(Jo Tae Jun, second Whenever Guest)

1721
00:58:32,730 --> 00:58:34,499
- Please come this way. - Okay.

1722
00:58:34,500 --> 00:58:35,600
We came to the right place.

1723
00:58:35,760 --> 00:58:37,400
He's the doctor.

1724
00:58:38,030 --> 00:58:39,369
- Hello. - Hello.

1725
00:58:39,370 --> 00:58:40,670
Hello. My goodness.

1726
00:58:40,800 --> 00:58:42,170
Gosh, this place...

1727
00:58:42,900 --> 00:58:44,586
- It smells like oriental medicine. - My goodness.

1728
00:58:44,610 --> 00:58:45,839
- You do manual therapy too. - Manual therapy.

1729
00:58:45,840 --> 00:58:47,179
Yes, I do chuna manual therapy.

1730
00:58:47,180 --> 00:58:48,979
- Chuna manual therapy. - We do chuna manual therapy here.

1731
00:58:48,980 --> 00:58:50,449
Chuna manual therapy.

1732
00:58:50,450 --> 00:58:51,450
Yes.

1733
00:58:51,451 --> 00:58:54,131
(An oriental medicine clinic office is the second spare time spot.)

1734
00:58:54,320 --> 00:58:56,650
(He becomes curious.)

1735
00:58:56,820 --> 00:58:58,419
Although you look very young, you have children.

1736
00:58:58,420 --> 00:59:00,290
Yes, I have two children.

1737
00:59:00,990 --> 00:59:03,119
My oldest son will be entering third grade.

1738
00:59:03,120 --> 00:59:04,129
(Whenever Guest has 2 sons who are 10 and 4 years old.)

1739
00:59:04,130 --> 00:59:05,390
I see.

1740
00:59:05,490 --> 00:59:07,060
- Please take a seat. - Okay.

1741
00:59:07,500 --> 00:59:09,100
- You know... - Yes.

1742
00:59:09,260 --> 00:59:11,999
According to the story we've read, you used to work...

1743
00:59:12,000 --> 00:59:13,900
- at a major corporation. - Yes.

1744
00:59:13,970 --> 00:59:15,899
Now, you're an oriental medicine doctor.

1745
00:59:15,900 --> 00:59:16,940
That's right.

1746
00:59:17,310 --> 00:59:19,139
- Is that so? - When I was...

1747
00:59:19,140 --> 00:59:21,410
- three years into working, - Okay.

1748
00:59:21,910 --> 00:59:23,240
I became a bit fed up.

1749
00:59:24,010 --> 00:59:25,579
I mean...

1750
00:59:25,580 --> 00:59:27,750
(Reason for resignation: Being fed up)

1751
00:59:27,850 --> 00:59:30,320
- Did you go back to college? - Yes, I went back to college.

1752
00:59:31,320 --> 00:59:32,489
I went back to college.

1753
00:59:32,490 --> 00:59:36,190
- Where did you use to work? - Which corporation was it?

1754
00:59:36,460 --> 00:59:37,889
- It was HD Hyundai Oilbank. - I see.

1755
00:59:37,890 --> 00:59:39,760
- Is it okay to reveal the name? - It's okay.

1756
00:59:40,130 --> 00:59:41,429
- A refinery company. - Okay.

1757
00:59:41,430 --> 00:59:44,370
What you wrote was quite unusual. You wrote that...

1758
00:59:44,770 --> 00:59:47,570
you were a dopamine chaser.

1759
00:59:47,670 --> 00:59:49,039
I like stimulating situations...

1760
00:59:49,040 --> 00:59:50,140
that bring competitions.

1761
00:59:50,670 --> 00:59:52,139
- Do you like them? - I like them.

1762
00:59:52,140 --> 00:59:53,370
I like getting ranked.

1763
00:59:54,380 --> 00:59:55,739
That was how I studied for CSAT.

1764
00:59:55,740 --> 00:59:58,410
I studied for CSAT without quitting my job.

1765
00:59:59,050 --> 01:00:01,579
- I came home at 7pm after work. - You're a genius.

1766
01:00:01,580 --> 01:00:03,100
- I'm not a genius. - You're a genius.

1767
01:00:03,250 --> 01:00:05,489
My wife said that the look in my eyes changed...

1768
01:00:05,490 --> 01:00:07,290
- back then. - How did they change?

1769
01:00:07,760 --> 01:00:09,436
She said that I looked like a different person.

1770
01:00:09,460 --> 01:00:11,690
Do you like competitions that much?

1771
01:00:12,030 --> 01:00:13,130
Yes, I like them.

1772
01:00:13,260 --> 01:00:15,540
I like getting ranked. I like the competitions I can win.

1773
01:00:15,600 --> 01:00:17,769
Do you play games?

1774
01:00:17,770 --> 01:00:20,300
I play games and take tests.

1775
01:00:20,500 --> 01:00:23,199
- You run a clinic now. - Yes.

1776
01:00:23,200 --> 01:00:27,040
Isn't this job pretty far from a competitive life?

1777
01:00:27,680 --> 01:00:30,380
- When patients come, - Okay.

1778
01:00:30,980 --> 01:00:34,850
I make it my goal to cure each one of them.

1779
01:00:35,180 --> 01:00:37,619
I treat my patients with that goal.

1780
01:00:37,620 --> 01:00:39,619
Do you have a desire to conquer?

1781
01:00:39,620 --> 01:00:42,460
Will you quit the clinic when all the patients get better?

1782
01:00:42,760 --> 01:00:43,789
They'll keep coming.

1783
01:00:43,790 --> 01:00:45,589
- New patients. - New patients will keep coming.

1784
01:00:45,590 --> 01:00:47,536
(That won't happen since new targets will keep coming.)

1785
01:00:47,560 --> 01:00:50,059
What's the top 0.4 percent?

1786
01:00:50,060 --> 01:00:52,730
- Which area... - It's a game.

1787
01:00:53,270 --> 01:00:54,499
It's called "League of Legends."

1788
01:00:54,500 --> 01:00:56,339
- I see. "LoL." - Yes.

1789
01:00:56,340 --> 01:00:58,810
- Are you in the top 0.4 percent? - Yes.

1790
01:00:59,010 --> 01:01:01,450
- That means you're very good at it. - I was very good at it.

1791
01:01:02,540 --> 01:01:06,309
Did you get fed up after reaching the top?

1792
01:01:06,310 --> 01:01:08,420
- I don't play it anymore. - Why not?

1793
01:01:08,620 --> 01:01:12,019
- After reaching the top, - He has a desire to conquer.

1794
01:01:12,020 --> 01:01:13,049
It became a bit...

1795
01:01:13,050 --> 01:01:15,589
The top 0.4 percent is impressive.

1796
01:01:15,590 --> 01:01:17,659
That's right. I spent a lot of time on it.

1797
01:01:17,660 --> 01:01:18,760
How much time?

1798
01:01:19,160 --> 01:01:20,960
I played it about 19 hours a day.

1799
01:01:22,660 --> 01:01:26,300
I don't play games, so I can't relate to his story.

1800
01:01:26,570 --> 01:01:28,369
That's what it takes...

1801
01:01:28,370 --> 01:01:30,199
- to reach the top 0.4 percent. - That's right.

1802
01:01:30,200 --> 01:01:31,539
You can't do it any other way.

1803
01:01:31,540 --> 01:01:33,469
I played the game even after getting married.

1804
01:01:33,470 --> 01:01:35,810
Wasn't your wife dissatisfied?

1805
01:01:36,010 --> 01:01:37,249
Exactly.

1806
01:01:37,250 --> 01:01:40,580
My wife didn't like it when I played the game,

1807
01:01:40,820 --> 01:01:42,150
so I did it in secret.

1808
01:01:42,580 --> 01:01:43,949
- How did you do it in secret? - How did you do it?

1809
01:01:43,950 --> 01:01:46,490
- I have a great tip. - How did you do it?

1810
01:01:46,620 --> 01:01:49,160
I don't play the game anymore. I never play it now.

1811
01:01:49,390 --> 01:01:51,189
I only did this in the past.

1812
01:01:51,190 --> 01:01:53,489
- What did you do? - At around 9pm,

1813
01:01:53,490 --> 01:01:55,160
I drank 500ml of water.

1814
01:01:55,260 --> 01:01:56,599
- Okay. - I drank 500ml of water.

1815
01:01:56,600 --> 01:01:59,170
- Your bladder can store... - You drank 500ml of water.

1816
01:01:59,800 --> 01:02:02,769
About 300 to 400ml of water.

1817
01:02:02,770 --> 01:02:04,340
You drank more than that.

1818
01:02:04,540 --> 01:02:07,740
When you drink that much water at 9pm, you wake up at 3am.

1819
01:02:07,880 --> 01:02:09,110
- At 3am? - At 3am.

1820
01:02:09,310 --> 01:02:10,470
- You wake up to pee. - Okay.

1821
01:02:10,910 --> 01:02:12,790
Had I set the alarm, my wife would've heard it.

1822
01:02:14,680 --> 01:02:16,580
- You... - Do you have to go that far?

1823
01:02:17,690 --> 01:02:21,189
- You set your biological alarm. - I set your biological alarm.

1824
01:02:21,190 --> 01:02:22,689
You drank water at 9pm...

1825
01:02:22,690 --> 01:02:24,259
- to wake up at 3am. - That's right.

1826
01:02:24,260 --> 01:02:26,930
- You drank 500ml of water at 9pm. - Then I woke up at 3am.

1827
01:02:27,630 --> 01:02:29,860
After waking up then,

1828
01:02:30,330 --> 01:02:31,900
- Did you play it? - I peed...

1829
01:02:32,500 --> 01:02:34,016
- and waited for a short while... - Okay.

1830
01:02:34,040 --> 01:02:35,469
In case my wife woke up.

1831
01:02:35,470 --> 01:02:36,540
My goodness.

1832
01:02:38,070 --> 01:02:41,510
I sat still for ten minutes.

1833
01:02:42,640 --> 01:02:43,720
The details are impressive.

1834
01:02:44,080 --> 01:02:45,950
I didn't play the game for too long.

1835
01:02:46,110 --> 01:02:47,349
I stopped after playing for about three hours.

1836
01:02:47,350 --> 01:02:49,080
- Before your wife woke up. - That's right.

1837
01:02:49,150 --> 01:02:51,550
- Before your wife woke up. - Then I began to do the chores.

1838
01:02:52,250 --> 01:02:53,819
At 6am, I began to do the chores.

1839
01:02:53,820 --> 01:02:56,189
I folded the laundry and mopped the floor.

1840
01:02:56,190 --> 01:02:57,470
(He did the chores for an hour.)

1841
01:02:58,060 --> 01:03:00,166
Then my wife woke up and went, "Honey, what are you doing?"

1842
01:03:00,190 --> 01:03:01,759
"You must be exhausted from the household chores."

1843
01:03:01,760 --> 01:03:03,099
(Honey, I did the chores so that you wouldn't be exhausted.)

1844
01:03:03,100 --> 01:03:06,199
- "I decided to help." - I bet she took you as a sweet man.

1845
01:03:06,200 --> 01:03:07,339
(There was a reason behind his sweetness.)

1846
01:03:07,340 --> 01:03:09,969
- You're something else. - You're something else.

1847
01:03:09,970 --> 01:03:12,270
- I went that far. - Seriously, you're something else.

1848
01:03:12,770 --> 01:03:14,609
He sacrificed sleep to play the game.

1849
01:03:14,610 --> 01:03:16,040
- Yes. - Exactly.

1850
01:03:16,240 --> 01:03:17,879
What were you like when you dated your wife?

1851
01:03:17,880 --> 01:03:19,409
- Were you the same? - I was the same.

1852
01:03:19,410 --> 01:03:21,880
- Really? - A friend in my class went,

1853
01:03:22,120 --> 01:03:23,780
- "She's really pretty." - Okay.

1854
01:03:24,250 --> 01:03:25,590
- She was pretty indeed. - Okay.

1855
01:03:25,720 --> 01:03:28,260
- So I asked for her number. - I see.

1856
01:03:28,590 --> 01:03:31,190
Every day, I made her packed lunch...

1857
01:03:31,760 --> 01:03:33,090
as well as fruit juice.

1858
01:03:34,000 --> 01:03:35,000
(He went all in for love.)

1859
01:03:35,001 --> 01:03:38,830
- I become obsessed with one thing. - You become obsessed.

1860
01:03:39,170 --> 01:03:41,270
We dated that way.

1861
01:03:41,500 --> 01:03:43,769
We dated for three years.

1862
01:03:43,770 --> 01:03:45,810
- Then you guys got married. - Then we got married.

1863
01:03:46,310 --> 01:03:47,439
(Laughing)

1864
01:03:47,440 --> 01:03:50,610
- He talks like Jang Hang Jun. - Yes, he does.

1865
01:03:50,710 --> 01:03:52,579
- A little bit. - I see the resemblance.

1866
01:03:52,580 --> 01:03:54,320
- He reminds me of Jang Hang Jun. - Yes.

1867
01:03:54,550 --> 01:03:55,919
- He does. - Really?

1868
01:03:55,920 --> 01:03:57,790
Did you have a nickname back in school?

1869
01:03:57,950 --> 01:03:59,119
Back in school?

1870
01:03:59,120 --> 01:04:00,449
- Like in middle and high schools? - Yes.

1871
01:04:00,450 --> 01:04:01,560
Chatterbox.

1872
01:04:02,420 --> 01:04:03,790
He's like Jang Hang Jun.

1873
01:04:04,090 --> 01:04:05,289
I talked too much.

1874
01:04:05,290 --> 01:04:07,459
Jang Hang Jun's nickname is Chatterbox.

1875
01:04:07,460 --> 01:04:09,430
- Really? - Jang Hang Jun.

1876
01:04:09,560 --> 01:04:11,570
- Yes. - I talked too much.

1877
01:04:12,430 --> 01:04:13,499
- Really? - I was the same...

1878
01:04:13,500 --> 01:04:15,400
- when my wife and I were dating. - Really?

1879
01:04:15,640 --> 01:04:19,040
My wife didn't complain at first.

1880
01:04:19,740 --> 01:04:21,140
After dating for a while...

1881
01:04:21,280 --> 01:04:24,450
When we were dating, I talked and she listened.

1882
01:04:25,180 --> 01:04:29,450
She asked me, "Can you be quiet for just one minute?"

1883
01:04:30,950 --> 01:04:34,189
Was that what your wife said the most often?

1884
01:04:34,190 --> 01:04:36,710
- "Be quiet for just 1 minute." - "Be quiet for just 1 minute."

1885
01:04:37,190 --> 01:04:38,360
She said that her ears hurt.

1886
01:04:38,660 --> 01:04:41,199
There are things they hear upon getting married.

1887
01:04:41,200 --> 01:04:42,200
What does she say now?

1888
01:04:42,201 --> 01:04:44,270
These days? "At least you should be quiet."

1889
01:04:44,370 --> 01:04:46,010
- What? - "At least you should be quiet."

1890
01:04:46,500 --> 01:04:47,599
Her words have changed.

1891
01:04:47,600 --> 01:04:48,900
We have two sons.

1892
01:04:49,170 --> 01:04:51,510
- Do you talk more than them? - Our sons talk too much.

1893
01:04:51,870 --> 01:04:54,479
- They talk without rest. - "At least you should be quiet."

1894
01:04:54,480 --> 01:04:56,879
My wife is the only one I can talk to after work.

1895
01:04:56,880 --> 01:05:00,820
At 9pm, I hurry home to talk to my wife.

1896
01:05:01,080 --> 01:05:03,650
I go, "Honey."

1897
01:05:04,590 --> 01:05:05,826
You begin as you open the door.

1898
01:05:05,850 --> 01:05:09,390
"Do you know what happened today?"

1899
01:05:09,990 --> 01:05:12,129
The kids talk to her too.

1900
01:05:12,130 --> 01:05:15,530
I've only met you today, but I can tell...

1901
01:05:15,600 --> 01:05:18,270
- that you become laser-focused... - Yes.

1902
01:05:18,430 --> 01:05:20,800
- when you have a goal in mind. - That's right.

1903
01:05:21,140 --> 01:05:22,969
We need to play a game today.

1904
01:05:22,970 --> 01:05:24,170
I love games.

1905
01:05:26,010 --> 01:05:27,710
- We're in trouble. - If we do badly...

1906
01:05:27,840 --> 01:05:28,909
Seriously.

1907
01:05:28,910 --> 01:05:30,410
Maybe he'll suddenly go insane.

1908
01:05:30,750 --> 01:05:32,380
Let's roll the dice.

1909
01:05:32,710 --> 01:05:34,456
- You can do it this time, Chae Won. - Chae Won.

1910
01:05:34,480 --> 01:05:35,919
- Roll it here. - Which number...

1911
01:05:35,920 --> 01:05:37,179
- Okay. - Which number do you want?

1912
01:05:37,180 --> 01:05:39,050
- Two, of course. - Two.

1913
01:05:39,890 --> 01:05:42,359
I think he'll enjoy participating.

1914
01:05:42,360 --> 01:05:43,919
- Shall I throw it here? Okay. - Throw it here.

1915
01:05:43,920 --> 01:05:45,030
One, two, three.

1916
01:05:46,390 --> 01:05:47,960
- One. - It's okay.

1917
01:05:48,360 --> 01:05:49,729
- Not bad. - One is perfect.

1918
01:05:49,730 --> 01:05:53,300
- Not bad. - He can participate in it once.

1919
01:05:56,270 --> 01:05:57,410
Round One.

1920
01:05:57,640 --> 01:05:59,869
Let's check out the Round One prize.

1921
01:05:59,870 --> 01:06:01,580
- Okay. - Please open it.

1922
01:06:02,840 --> 01:06:03,840
(Smashing)

1923
01:06:07,450 --> 01:06:09,256
It's my first time seeing someone open a fortune cookie like that.

1924
01:06:09,280 --> 01:06:10,349
He opened it like an egg.

1925
01:06:10,350 --> 01:06:12,990
- Most people open it like this. - He really is Chatterbox.

1926
01:06:13,820 --> 01:06:15,190
- What? - What is it?

1927
01:06:15,420 --> 01:06:17,929
"For the much-appreciated patients who come to the clinic..."

1928
01:06:17,930 --> 01:06:18,960
That's right.

1929
01:06:19,330 --> 01:06:21,170
"Let's come to work with a clean-shaven face."

1930
01:06:21,330 --> 01:06:22,499
Braun electric shaver.

1931
01:06:22,500 --> 01:06:24,269
(Round 1 prize, Braun electric shaver)

1932
01:06:24,270 --> 01:06:26,330
- This is it. - An electric shaver.

1933
01:06:27,170 --> 01:06:28,200
- This is it. - Good.

1934
01:06:28,570 --> 01:06:29,969
- This is good. - This is perfect.

1935
01:06:29,970 --> 01:06:31,309
(Keep yourself clean-shaven for the much-appreciated patients, )

1936
01:06:31,310 --> 01:06:32,640
(Braun electric shaver)

1937
01:06:33,210 --> 01:06:34,779
I love this scent.

1938
01:06:34,780 --> 01:06:36,740
- The oriental medicine scent. - I love it.

1939
01:06:36,980 --> 01:06:38,909
- I feel like I'm getting healthy. - I love it too.

1940
01:06:38,910 --> 01:06:40,880
(Gongjindan Bang!)

1941
01:06:41,080 --> 01:06:43,319
(Hit a table tennis ball using a tongue depressor...)

1942
01:06:43,320 --> 01:06:45,449
(to knock off the Gongjindan cases.)

1943
01:06:45,450 --> 01:06:47,489
(They will get 10 table tennis balls.)

1944
01:06:47,490 --> 01:06:50,660
(The time limit is 30 seconds.)

1945
01:06:51,560 --> 01:06:52,890
I think I'll do this well.

1946
01:06:54,730 --> 01:06:55,830
Using a tongue depressor...

1947
01:06:56,030 --> 01:06:57,830
- We hit the balls with this, - That's right.

1948
01:06:58,030 --> 01:06:59,030
And knock off two cases.

1949
01:06:59,031 --> 01:07:01,199
- We hit the balls like this. - Yes.

1950
01:07:01,200 --> 01:07:02,939
- It's doable. - Let give it a try.

1951
01:07:02,940 --> 01:07:04,340
- Let's practice. - Let's practice.

1952
01:07:04,940 --> 01:07:06,109
Let me try it.

1953
01:07:06,110 --> 01:07:07,239
Are we sending the balls between the cases?

1954
01:07:07,240 --> 01:07:09,210
No, we need to knock them off.

1955
01:07:10,510 --> 01:07:11,579
We need to knock them off.

1956
01:07:11,580 --> 01:07:14,150
(He succeeds in it on his first try.)

1957
01:07:14,350 --> 01:07:15,480
- You're good. - Good.

1958
01:07:15,780 --> 01:07:17,489
- This is good. - We got a doable game.

1959
01:07:17,490 --> 01:07:18,589
Try it, Chae Won.

1960
01:07:18,590 --> 01:07:19,950
- Flick it. - That's the method.

1961
01:07:20,320 --> 01:07:21,789
- Hit the ball with it. - That's right. Flick it.

1962
01:07:21,790 --> 01:07:22,859
We just need to work fast.

1963
01:07:22,860 --> 01:07:24,529
- Okay. - Okay.

1964
01:07:24,530 --> 01:07:26,660
- We'll succeed in it in no time. - This is doable.

1965
01:07:27,130 --> 01:07:28,360
- Not bad. - This is doable.

1966
01:07:28,500 --> 01:07:30,059
- That's right. - There's a time limit,

1967
01:07:30,060 --> 01:07:31,199
so hold a ball each.

1968
01:07:31,200 --> 01:07:32,720
Hold a ball. We need to go right away.

1969
01:07:32,770 --> 01:07:34,700
Let's decide on the number.

1970
01:07:34,900 --> 01:07:37,710
- The 2 guests get 3 balls each. - We only get 30 seconds.

1971
01:07:38,070 --> 01:07:39,170
Take three balls each.

1972
01:07:39,310 --> 01:07:40,609
- We get 2 balls each. - We get 2 balls each.

1973
01:07:40,610 --> 01:07:41,709
Yes. That'll do.

1974
01:07:41,710 --> 01:07:42,780
Now...

1975
01:07:42,910 --> 01:07:45,679
- Shall we begin with Round One? - Let's begin right away.

1976
01:07:45,680 --> 01:07:46,880
Let's do a cheer.

1977
01:07:47,350 --> 01:07:48,479
In 1, 2, 3.

1978
01:07:48,480 --> 01:07:50,279
- Let's go! Let's go in this order. - Let's go!

1979
01:07:50,280 --> 01:07:51,689
- Shall we go in this order? - Yes.

1980
01:07:51,690 --> 01:07:52,719
Okay.

1981
01:07:52,720 --> 01:07:54,680
- The ball needs to roll. - I think we can do it.

1982
01:07:56,460 --> 01:07:57,530
All right.

1983
01:07:58,160 --> 01:07:59,630
- Hey. - What?

1984
01:08:00,760 --> 01:08:02,100
- Good. - We got one.

1985
01:08:02,430 --> 01:08:03,859
(He knocks off 1.)

1986
01:08:03,860 --> 01:08:05,830
- We got one. - Good.

1987
01:08:06,570 --> 01:08:07,900
I'll finish it.

1988
01:08:08,740 --> 01:08:09,800
I'll finish it.

1989
01:08:12,240 --> 01:08:13,309
Chae Won, hurry.

1990
01:08:13,310 --> 01:08:14,870
- We don't have time. - The ball moves.

1991
01:08:15,180 --> 01:08:16,840
- We don't have time. - The ball moves.

1992
01:08:18,080 --> 01:08:19,750
- Ten seconds remain. - One more.

1993
01:08:20,980 --> 01:08:22,219
- Why can't I do it? - Come on.

1994
01:08:22,220 --> 01:08:24,549
- Five, four, - Why can't I do it?

1995
01:08:24,550 --> 01:08:26,589
Three, two,

1996
01:08:26,590 --> 01:08:27,620
one.

1997
01:08:28,320 --> 01:08:29,889
(Jae Suk finished it.)

1998
01:08:29,890 --> 01:08:31,090
You didn't disappoint.

1999
01:08:31,260 --> 01:08:32,260
One.

2000
01:08:32,261 --> 01:08:34,190
(A clean buzzer-beater)

2001
01:08:34,460 --> 01:08:35,629
You didn't disappoint.

2002
01:08:35,630 --> 01:08:37,460
- We did it. - Jae Suk.

2003
01:08:37,770 --> 01:08:38,870
We did it.

2004
01:08:38,970 --> 01:08:40,630
- We did it. - It was a buzzer-beater.

2005
01:08:41,000 --> 01:08:42,200
It was a buzzer-beater.

2006
01:08:42,970 --> 01:08:44,250
For the first time in a while...

2007
01:08:44,310 --> 01:08:45,569
Did you get a dopamine rush?

2008
01:08:45,570 --> 01:08:47,639
- Yes. That's how it should be. - Of course.

2009
01:08:47,640 --> 01:08:49,039
- You succeeded in it in the end. - We succeeded in it in the end.

2010
01:08:49,040 --> 01:08:50,440
(His dopamine level is at its max.)

2011
01:08:50,740 --> 01:08:52,279
- All right. - He's happy...

2012
01:08:52,280 --> 01:08:53,449
- that we did it in the end. - Nice.

2013
01:08:53,450 --> 01:08:54,450
He's smiling from ear to ear.

2014
01:08:54,451 --> 01:08:56,679
Thus, Round One is...

2015
01:08:56,680 --> 01:08:57,790
- a success. - A success.

2016
01:08:58,350 --> 01:09:01,019
- You've won an electric shaver. - Okay.

2017
01:09:01,020 --> 01:09:02,189
- My goodness. - Now...

2018
01:09:02,190 --> 01:09:04,019
Please decide if you'll keep going or stop.

2019
01:09:04,020 --> 01:09:05,589
- Of course, I'll keep going. - Let's go.

2020
01:09:05,590 --> 01:09:07,329
- He likes dopamine. - Yes.

2021
01:09:07,330 --> 01:09:10,060
- He'll take it to Round Three. - We have many tries left.

2022
01:09:10,500 --> 01:09:11,800
It has been a while.

2023
01:09:12,330 --> 01:09:14,199
The difficulty level will go up.

2024
01:09:14,200 --> 01:09:15,969
That's what makes it fun.

2025
01:09:15,970 --> 01:09:17,200
No way!

2026
01:09:17,440 --> 01:09:20,439
"You used to play games alone. Now, it's a precious hobby..."

2027
01:09:20,440 --> 01:09:22,179
"you can enjoy with your family."

2028
01:09:22,180 --> 01:09:23,639
Nintendo Switch Two.

2029
01:09:23,640 --> 01:09:25,480
(Round 2 prize, Nintendo Switch 2)

2030
01:09:26,010 --> 01:09:27,550
I don't have it either.

2031
01:09:27,750 --> 01:09:29,319
It's heavy.

2032
01:09:29,320 --> 01:09:30,420
Hold it.

2033
01:09:32,190 --> 01:09:33,549
I don't have it either.

2034
01:09:33,550 --> 01:09:37,119
(Hobby time with the family, Nintendo Switch 2)

2035
01:09:37,120 --> 01:09:38,759
(Round 2)

2036
01:09:38,760 --> 01:09:40,959
(The targets will be elevated.)

2037
01:09:40,960 --> 01:09:42,660
- Now... - What's this?

2038
01:09:43,200 --> 01:09:44,530
What should we do?

2039
01:09:45,030 --> 01:09:46,329
- This is... - Like this?

2040
01:09:46,330 --> 01:09:47,839
- Then... - How...

2041
01:09:47,840 --> 01:09:50,200
- How will we send the balls up? - Can we bounce the balls?

2042
01:09:50,470 --> 01:09:51,939
- Can we bounce the balls? - Yes.

2043
01:09:51,940 --> 01:09:53,660
- How will we send the balls up? - Hold on.

2044
01:09:54,310 --> 01:09:55,880
Hold on. Can we send them up?

2045
01:09:59,080 --> 01:10:00,400
(He hits the bottom of the ball.)

2046
01:10:00,850 --> 01:10:01,850
(It does go up!)

2047
01:10:01,851 --> 01:10:03,120
We need to send them up.

2048
01:10:03,420 --> 01:10:05,450
- Can we practice? - Yes.

2049
01:10:06,190 --> 01:10:07,489
We need to do this in earnest.

2050
01:10:07,490 --> 01:10:09,810
We need to add an angle like it's golf. It's like an iron.

2051
01:10:10,360 --> 01:10:11,360
Hold on.

2052
01:10:11,361 --> 01:10:12,690
(An iron?)

2053
01:10:13,430 --> 01:10:15,100
An iron? That's right.

2054
01:10:18,030 --> 01:10:19,170
It's hard.

2055
01:10:19,400 --> 01:10:22,070
I'll need to finish it. I have that hunch.

2056
01:10:22,440 --> 01:10:24,169
- In one go... - You'll need to finish it?

2057
01:10:24,170 --> 01:10:26,109
I have a hunch that I'll need to finish it.

2058
01:10:26,110 --> 01:10:27,140
Why?

2059
01:10:34,880 --> 01:10:35,880
(Sang Woo hits it!)

2060
01:10:35,881 --> 01:10:37,580
Who was it?

2061
01:10:37,820 --> 01:10:39,649
(It was me, the hitman!)

2062
01:10:39,650 --> 01:10:40,690
The hitman.

2063
01:10:41,020 --> 01:10:42,259
- Really? - I aimed for the left one,

2064
01:10:42,260 --> 01:10:43,320
but hit the right one.

2065
01:10:46,060 --> 01:10:47,799
- Shall we give it a go? - Here we go!

2066
01:10:47,800 --> 01:10:49,829
- Shall we go in this order? - Okay.

2067
01:10:49,830 --> 01:10:51,569
- Thirty seconds. - How many balls?

2068
01:10:51,570 --> 01:10:53,129
Sang Woo, do you want 2 or 3?

2069
01:10:53,130 --> 01:10:54,369
- I want three. - Three.

2070
01:10:54,370 --> 01:10:56,340
- Three. - I just need to knock off one.

2071
01:10:56,870 --> 01:10:58,539
Let's do this. Here we go!

2072
01:10:58,540 --> 01:11:00,910
- Here we go! - Ready. Set.

2073
01:11:05,350 --> 01:11:06,350
One.

2074
01:11:06,850 --> 01:11:07,879
One.

2075
01:11:07,880 --> 01:11:09,519
- We did it. - We're set.

2076
01:11:09,520 --> 01:11:10,950
- Who's next? - Hurry up.

2077
01:11:12,790 --> 01:11:13,790
Please.

2078
01:11:17,160 --> 01:11:18,290
It was so close.

2079
01:11:18,590 --> 01:11:20,390
- It was so close. - How many seconds remain?

2080
01:11:22,200 --> 01:11:23,200
Ten seconds.

2081
01:11:25,830 --> 01:11:27,529
- Why can't I hit it? - Ten seconds.

2082
01:11:27,530 --> 01:11:29,140
Five, four,

2083
01:11:29,600 --> 01:11:31,939
- three, two, - Hey.

2084
01:11:31,940 --> 01:11:33,610
- one. - Hold on. Hey.

2085
01:11:33,670 --> 01:11:35,140
(They fail.)

2086
01:11:35,440 --> 01:11:37,040
Why did you enter?

2087
01:11:37,210 --> 01:11:38,479
I felt pressed.

2088
01:11:38,480 --> 01:11:40,320
(He suddenly entered because he felt pressed.)

2089
01:11:40,480 --> 01:11:42,449
We were so close.

2090
01:11:42,450 --> 01:11:44,079
We run out of time.

2091
01:11:44,080 --> 01:11:45,589
- Here's what I think. - From both sides...

2092
01:11:45,590 --> 01:11:47,089
Lining up the balls takes time,

2093
01:11:47,090 --> 01:11:48,460
so let's do it in advance.

2094
01:11:49,260 --> 01:11:50,389
Then we can hit this ball first.

2095
01:11:50,390 --> 01:11:51,530
Okay.

2096
01:11:52,430 --> 01:11:53,659
Let's do this.

2097
01:11:53,660 --> 01:11:55,960
I feel like you'll hit all of them.

2098
01:11:57,300 --> 01:11:58,970
I'll hit all of them in ten seconds.

2099
01:11:59,900 --> 01:12:01,140
I'll sit here.

2100
01:12:02,370 --> 01:12:03,370
Here.

2101
01:12:03,540 --> 01:12:04,609
How about 5 or 6?

2102
01:12:04,610 --> 01:12:06,039
- Listen. - Sang Woo is good at this.

2103
01:12:06,040 --> 01:12:07,169
You can hit up to six balls.

2104
01:12:07,170 --> 01:12:08,909
- That's right. Hit 6 balls. - Hit 6 balls.

2105
01:12:08,910 --> 01:12:10,809
- Okay. - She can hit two balls.

2106
01:12:10,810 --> 01:12:12,109
- Then we can hit one each. - One each.

2107
01:12:12,110 --> 01:12:13,410
Let's go.

2108
01:12:13,750 --> 01:12:14,779
- Here we go! - In 1, 2, 3.

2109
01:12:14,780 --> 01:12:15,819
- Here we go! - Here we go!

2110
01:12:15,820 --> 01:12:17,350
Ready. Set.

2111
01:12:21,360 --> 01:12:22,390
Gosh.

2112
01:12:24,530 --> 01:12:25,590
Hey.

2113
01:12:26,560 --> 01:12:27,800
- For goodness' sake. - Hit it.

2114
01:12:28,300 --> 01:12:29,900
(It's a disaster.)

2115
01:12:30,530 --> 01:12:31,770
- For goodness' sake. - Hit it.

2116
01:12:32,330 --> 01:12:34,200
- Come on. - All of the balls came close.

2117
01:12:37,700 --> 01:12:40,110
- Just one. - Ten seconds.

2118
01:12:41,380 --> 01:12:42,380
It was close.

2119
01:12:42,381 --> 01:12:44,139
- Two. - Chae Won, come on.

2120
01:12:44,140 --> 01:12:46,609
- Here you go. - Five, four,

2121
01:12:46,610 --> 01:12:49,079
- three, two, one. - One ball remains.

2122
01:12:49,080 --> 01:12:50,349
(They fail.)

2123
01:12:50,350 --> 01:12:51,490
I'm sorry.

2124
01:12:52,920 --> 01:12:53,949
I'm sorry.

2125
01:12:53,950 --> 01:12:55,119
- Don't be. - Sang Woo.

2126
01:12:55,120 --> 01:12:57,490
- That didn't go well. - We gave you six balls.

2127
01:12:57,620 --> 01:12:58,889
- I'm sorry. - Sang Woo.

2128
01:12:58,890 --> 01:13:00,806
(Giving the hitman all the balls ends in a disaster.)

2129
01:13:00,830 --> 01:13:02,150
You get one ball in the next try.

2130
01:13:03,300 --> 01:13:05,269
- You get one ball in the next try. - I'll go last.

2131
01:13:05,270 --> 01:13:06,329
(The number of balls gets reduced.)

2132
01:13:06,330 --> 01:13:08,200
- You get one ball. - It was so close.

2133
01:13:08,940 --> 01:13:09,940
It was...

2134
01:13:10,940 --> 01:13:12,486
- Shall I hit harder? - Sang Woo took off his coat.

2135
01:13:12,510 --> 01:13:13,669
(He takes off his coat.)

2136
01:13:13,670 --> 01:13:14,750
It's making me competitive.

2137
01:13:15,710 --> 01:13:16,780
It's aggravating.

2138
01:13:17,480 --> 01:13:19,810
I got the hang of it.

2139
01:13:20,480 --> 01:13:21,519
Like this.

2140
01:13:21,520 --> 01:13:22,950
(Focused)

2141
01:13:25,220 --> 01:13:26,220
Sang Woo.

2142
01:13:28,590 --> 01:13:29,760
For goodness' sake.

2143
01:13:33,760 --> 01:13:35,359
- Give Sang Woo two. - Two?

2144
01:13:35,360 --> 01:13:36,429
- Give Sang Woo two. - Okay.

2145
01:13:36,430 --> 01:13:37,529
- Shall I take three? - Yes.

2146
01:13:37,530 --> 01:13:38,769
- Take 3. - I'll hit 3 balls.

2147
01:13:38,770 --> 01:13:40,106
I'm sure Yeon Seok will knock off one.

2148
01:13:40,130 --> 01:13:41,470
I'll knock off one.

2149
01:13:42,000 --> 01:13:44,069
- Let's go. In 1, 2, 3. - In 1, 2, 3.

2150
01:13:44,070 --> 01:13:45,139
- Here we go! - Here we go!

2151
01:13:45,140 --> 01:13:47,270
- Ready. Set. - It's the fourth try.

2152
01:13:52,680 --> 01:13:53,710
No.

2153
01:13:58,920 --> 01:13:59,920
(He knocks off 1 case!)

2154
01:13:59,921 --> 01:14:02,019
- Nice! - We're set.

2155
01:14:02,020 --> 01:14:03,390
Now, it's a matter of speed.

2156
01:14:05,190 --> 01:14:06,760
- Just 1. - Just 1.

2157
01:14:07,290 --> 01:14:08,559
- Gosh. - Gosh.

2158
01:14:08,560 --> 01:14:10,599
Go. We don't have time. Hurry up.

2159
01:14:10,600 --> 01:14:11,800
Ten seconds.

2160
01:14:13,130 --> 01:14:15,170
Sang Woo, stand by.

2161
01:14:16,840 --> 01:14:18,809
- Five, four, - Why can't I do it?

2162
01:14:18,810 --> 01:14:19,839
- three, - Just one.

2163
01:14:19,840 --> 01:14:21,070
- two... - Let's go.

2164
01:14:23,310 --> 01:14:24,339
- Dopamine! - Yes!

2165
01:14:24,340 --> 01:14:25,350
Let's go.

2166
01:14:25,550 --> 01:14:28,620
(Sang Woo finished it!)

2167
01:14:30,650 --> 01:14:31,949
It was another buzzer-beater.

2168
01:14:31,950 --> 01:14:33,489
(The second buzzer-beater gives them a dopamine rush.)

2169
01:14:33,490 --> 01:14:35,189
Are you getting a dopamine rush?

2170
01:14:35,190 --> 01:14:37,930
- This is it. - This is it.

2171
01:14:38,190 --> 01:14:40,630
- This is it. - This is a dopamine rush.

2172
01:14:40,760 --> 01:14:42,330
- I couldn't even scream. - Gosh.

2173
01:14:42,600 --> 01:14:43,700
This is it.

2174
01:14:49,340 --> 01:14:50,400
- Dopamine! - Yes!

2175
01:14:52,270 --> 01:14:53,409
You did so well.

2176
01:14:53,410 --> 01:14:55,039
- Well done. - Thus,

2177
01:14:55,040 --> 01:14:56,810
- Round Two was a success. - A success.

2178
01:14:57,510 --> 01:15:00,110
- This is a dopamine rush. - This is it.

2179
01:15:00,210 --> 01:15:01,579
You should succeed in it on the tenth try.

2180
01:15:01,580 --> 01:15:03,349
Do we have six tries?

2181
01:15:03,350 --> 01:15:05,749
Including the bonus coupon, we have seven tries left.

2182
01:15:05,750 --> 01:15:07,389
Will you keep going or stop?

2183
01:15:07,390 --> 01:15:08,390
Let's keep going!

2184
01:15:09,660 --> 01:15:11,289
- He'll keep going no matter what. - I knew he'd do that.

2185
01:15:11,290 --> 01:15:12,966
- He'll keep going no matter what. - No matter what.

2186
01:15:12,990 --> 01:15:14,660
- He's addicted to dopamine. - I know.

2187
01:15:14,730 --> 01:15:15,860
It can't be helped.

2188
01:15:16,000 --> 01:15:17,030
He'll keep going.

2189
01:15:17,200 --> 01:15:19,600
The younger version of Jang Hang Jun.

2190
01:15:21,440 --> 01:15:22,469
All right.

2191
01:15:22,470 --> 01:15:23,939
- My goodness. - My goodness.

2192
01:15:23,940 --> 01:15:25,869
"Whenever possible,"

2193
01:15:25,870 --> 01:15:28,609
"our family goes to the West Sea, the regular vacation spot."

2194
01:15:28,610 --> 01:15:31,239
A 2-night voucher for a 4-person room...

2195
01:15:31,240 --> 01:15:32,979
at Incheon P Hotel...

2196
01:15:32,980 --> 01:15:34,949
and a voucher for the breakfast buffet.

2197
01:15:34,950 --> 01:15:36,350
(The breakfast buffet is included.)

2198
01:15:36,480 --> 01:15:38,026
- The breakfast buffet is included. - It's included.

2199
01:15:38,050 --> 01:15:39,219
We should send them on a vacation.

2200
01:15:39,220 --> 01:15:40,220
(A 2-night voucher for a 4-person room at the P Hotel)

2201
01:15:40,221 --> 01:15:41,461
We need to give him this prize.

2202
01:15:41,920 --> 01:15:43,160
Let's do this.

2203
01:15:44,090 --> 01:15:45,359
(Round 3)

2204
01:15:45,360 --> 01:15:47,890
(The number of targets increases to 3.)

2205
01:15:48,060 --> 01:15:49,200
Three?

2206
01:15:49,400 --> 01:15:50,899
- It's okay. - Is the time limit the same?

2207
01:15:50,900 --> 01:15:52,770
- Yes, it's the same. - Thirty seconds.

2208
01:15:53,200 --> 01:15:54,976
It's pressuring since there are three targets.

2209
01:15:55,000 --> 01:15:58,110
If we aim for the middle, one of them will get knocked off.

2210
01:16:01,070 --> 01:16:04,079
Let's do this. This is the 5th try. In 1, 2, 3.

2211
01:16:04,080 --> 01:16:05,180
- Let's go! - Let's go!

2212
01:16:05,650 --> 01:16:06,780
Ready.

2213
01:16:07,410 --> 01:16:08,480
Set.

2214
01:16:11,490 --> 01:16:12,620
I need to adjust it.

2215
01:16:13,390 --> 01:16:14,450
Here. Hold on.

2216
01:16:15,720 --> 01:16:16,960
I'll knock off one.

2217
01:16:18,630 --> 01:16:19,630
Chae Won.

2218
01:16:25,370 --> 01:16:26,770
- We don't have much time. - No.

2219
01:16:26,900 --> 01:16:28,770
- My goodness. - Go right afterward.

2220
01:16:28,800 --> 01:16:30,199
Jae Suk, go right afterward.

2221
01:16:30,200 --> 01:16:32,070
Stand by and do it from the side.

2222
01:16:32,170 --> 01:16:34,270
- Ten seconds. - Stand by and do it from the side.

2223
01:16:40,810 --> 01:16:42,979
- Five, four, - For goodness' sake.

2224
01:16:42,980 --> 01:16:44,020
Three...

2225
01:16:46,220 --> 01:16:47,820
(They fail.)

2226
01:16:48,260 --> 01:16:49,700
The last few balls were too hurried.

2227
01:16:50,190 --> 01:16:51,629
- I was pressed. - Hey.

2228
01:16:51,630 --> 01:16:53,029
- Sang Woo. - I was pressed.

2229
01:16:53,030 --> 01:16:55,400
- Was it bad? - It was bad.

2230
01:16:58,500 --> 01:16:59,630
This isn't easy.

2231
01:17:01,270 --> 01:17:03,999
You should enter this time.

2232
01:17:04,000 --> 01:17:05,169
- We need to use the coupon. - Let's use the free chance.

2233
01:17:05,170 --> 01:17:06,170
Let's use it.

2234
01:17:06,171 --> 01:17:08,610
- You'll enter for the free chance. - Okay.

2235
01:17:08,810 --> 01:17:11,910
He's at the top 0.4 percent when it comes to "LoL."

2236
01:17:12,110 --> 01:17:14,609
One person should sit out when you enter.

2237
01:17:14,610 --> 01:17:18,689
- Who should sit out? - If you stare at the person...

2238
01:17:18,690 --> 01:17:19,749
Are you staring at me?

2239
01:17:19,750 --> 01:17:20,750
Yes.

2240
01:17:21,760 --> 01:17:23,889
I wasn't done talking.

2241
01:17:23,890 --> 01:17:26,389
- Come on. We don't have much time. - I wasn't done talking.

2242
01:17:26,390 --> 01:17:28,460
- Go away. - He's too impatient.

2243
01:17:28,930 --> 01:17:30,059
What will be the order?

2244
01:17:30,060 --> 01:17:31,200
I'll go last.

2245
01:17:32,030 --> 01:17:33,769
I'll knock off two balls in the beginning.

2246
01:17:33,770 --> 01:17:35,870
- Good. - He wants to go last.

2247
01:17:35,940 --> 01:17:38,509
If he fails today,

2248
01:17:38,510 --> 01:17:40,590
- I'll go home and practice. - he'll wake up at 3am.

2249
01:17:42,140 --> 01:17:43,140
All right.

2250
01:17:43,440 --> 01:17:44,509
- Here we go! - Here we go!

2251
01:17:44,510 --> 01:17:46,080
Ready. Set.

2252
01:17:48,320 --> 01:17:49,950
He got the hang of it.

2253
01:17:50,180 --> 01:17:51,220
Please.

2254
01:17:52,490 --> 01:17:54,549
(He crawls quickly to make an exit.)

2255
01:17:54,550 --> 01:17:55,990
Seriously, it's hard.

2256
01:17:59,260 --> 01:18:00,260
I'm sorry.

2257
01:18:00,360 --> 01:18:02,100
- It's okay. - Why can't I do it?

2258
01:18:02,460 --> 01:18:04,400
- Not much time remains. - How many seconds?

2259
01:18:05,670 --> 01:18:07,029
I want to do well.

2260
01:18:07,030 --> 01:18:08,800
- Ten seconds. - Not much time remains.

2261
01:18:10,000 --> 01:18:11,200
You just need to hit it.

2262
01:18:11,640 --> 01:18:13,670
(The doctor goes last.)

2263
01:18:14,270 --> 01:18:16,410
(Will he get a dopamine rush or fail?)

2264
01:18:16,610 --> 01:18:17,780
You just need to hit it.

2265
01:18:18,710 --> 01:18:19,710
What?

2266
01:18:21,580 --> 01:18:22,880
What was that?

2267
01:18:23,180 --> 01:18:24,620
He didn't get to do anything.

2268
01:18:25,550 --> 01:18:26,590
What?

2269
01:18:28,890 --> 01:18:31,370
(They can't believe their eyes upon seeing the rolling balls.)

2270
01:18:31,960 --> 01:18:33,690
- What was that? - Doctor!

2271
01:18:34,030 --> 01:18:35,800
- What? - What was that?

2272
01:18:36,000 --> 01:18:37,100
Doctor!

2273
01:18:37,500 --> 01:18:38,500
I'm sorry.

2274
01:18:38,501 --> 01:18:39,869
What was that?

2275
01:18:39,870 --> 01:18:41,270
I think this is faulty.

2276
01:18:42,070 --> 01:18:43,710
- What? - The tongue depressor is faulty.

2277
01:18:43,840 --> 01:18:45,910
You insisted on going last.

2278
01:18:46,010 --> 01:18:47,730
- You acted like you'd do well. - I mean...

2279
01:18:48,040 --> 01:18:49,080
Doctor.

2280
01:18:49,180 --> 01:18:51,040
You couldn't do anything.

2281
01:18:51,310 --> 01:18:53,249
We'll run out of tries soon.

2282
01:18:53,250 --> 01:18:54,279
(Only 3 tries remain.)

2283
01:18:54,280 --> 01:18:55,350
Let's go.

2284
01:18:59,850 --> 01:19:01,019
(Chuckling)

2285
01:19:01,020 --> 01:19:02,020
Oh, no.

2286
01:19:02,590 --> 01:19:05,060
Why does Jae Suk look so incompetent today?

2287
01:19:06,290 --> 01:19:08,400
(Incompetent)

2288
01:19:10,460 --> 01:19:11,769
We don't have time.

2289
01:19:11,770 --> 01:19:13,730
We don't have time to put down and set the balls.

2290
01:19:16,200 --> 01:19:17,200
What?

2291
01:19:19,370 --> 01:19:21,780
- What was that? - How did you do that?

2292
01:19:22,410 --> 01:19:24,179
(He flings the ball...)

2293
01:19:24,180 --> 01:19:27,110
(and knocks off 3 cases with 1 shot.)

2294
01:19:27,410 --> 01:19:29,919
(How is that possible?)

2295
01:19:29,920 --> 01:19:31,219
(Jae Suk is the most surprised.)

2296
01:19:31,220 --> 01:19:33,020
I mean... What was that?

2297
01:19:33,220 --> 01:19:34,620
We should've made it count!

2298
01:19:35,720 --> 01:19:36,820
How did that happen?

2299
01:19:37,020 --> 01:19:38,959
- He suddenly showed his superpower. - I mean...

2300
01:19:38,960 --> 01:19:40,129
What was that?

2301
01:19:40,130 --> 01:19:41,890
- What was that? - He showed his superpower.

2302
01:19:42,830 --> 01:19:44,299
- Let's go right away. - I should do this...

2303
01:19:44,300 --> 01:19:46,130
during one of the tries.

2304
01:19:46,300 --> 01:19:48,200
- Now... - Do it when you're in the zone.

2305
01:19:48,340 --> 01:19:49,839
- Let's go. - Let's go.

2306
01:19:49,840 --> 01:19:51,139
In 1, 2, 3.

2307
01:19:51,140 --> 01:19:52,210
- Let's go! - Let's go!

2308
01:19:52,510 --> 01:19:53,739
We only have try numbers 8, 9, and 10 left.

2309
01:19:53,740 --> 01:19:54,939
- Chae Won, good luck. - Okay.

2310
01:19:54,940 --> 01:19:55,980
- Let's go. - Let's go.

2311
01:19:56,340 --> 01:19:58,010
Ready. Set.

2312
01:20:03,780 --> 01:20:04,849
It was close.

2313
01:20:04,850 --> 01:20:05,850
Hurry up.

2314
01:20:12,730 --> 01:20:13,890
There you go!

2315
01:20:14,530 --> 01:20:16,100
(There you go!)

2316
01:20:18,270 --> 01:20:19,270
Yeon Seok.

2317
01:20:25,970 --> 01:20:27,370
- Ten seconds. - One each.

2318
01:20:30,380 --> 01:20:32,020
- Show us what you did earlier. - Five...

2319
01:20:34,010 --> 01:20:35,420
(They fail.)

2320
01:20:35,550 --> 01:20:37,620
What you did earlier.

2321
01:20:40,650 --> 01:20:43,319
(He's Messi only during practice.)

2322
01:20:43,320 --> 01:20:44,760
This is driving me crazy.

2323
01:20:44,820 --> 01:20:45,859
(Only two tries remain.)

2324
01:20:45,860 --> 01:20:47,190
- Do two tries remain? - Yes.

2325
01:20:47,730 --> 01:20:48,760
That's enough.

2326
01:20:49,060 --> 01:20:50,530
Let me take a restroom break.

2327
01:20:51,970 --> 01:20:53,130
Let me take a restroom break.

2328
01:20:53,330 --> 01:20:54,629
- Let me take a restroom break. - Did you drink 500ml of water?

2329
01:20:54,630 --> 01:20:56,576
(Practice World Messi goes to the restroom due to nerves.)

2330
01:20:56,600 --> 01:20:57,869
I'm usually good at this.

2331
01:20:57,870 --> 01:20:59,510
Why can't I get the hang of it?

2332
01:21:00,410 --> 01:21:01,930
Perhaps the eye level should be lower.

2333
01:21:04,810 --> 01:21:06,910
- What was that? - We do well during practice.

2334
01:21:08,720 --> 01:21:09,750
You should do that.

2335
01:21:10,550 --> 01:21:12,310
- We should do that. - I'll use this method.

2336
01:21:14,850 --> 01:21:16,459
Like this?

2337
01:21:16,460 --> 01:21:18,159
(Chae Won tries holding the stick vertically.)

2338
01:21:18,160 --> 01:21:19,190
Like this?

2339
01:21:21,760 --> 01:21:23,460
This is much better.

2340
01:21:23,500 --> 01:21:25,099
- It's easier, right? - Yes.

2341
01:21:25,100 --> 01:21:26,129
(She practices until she succeeds in it.)

2342
01:21:26,130 --> 01:21:27,130
Good.

2343
01:21:27,370 --> 01:21:28,370
I won't practice.

2344
01:21:31,740 --> 01:21:33,110
- That's a good strategy. - Good.

2345
01:21:33,510 --> 01:21:34,810
We don't need to do it at once.

2346
01:21:34,910 --> 01:21:35,910
We're set.

2347
01:21:35,911 --> 01:21:37,279
We need to succeed in Round Three.

2348
01:21:37,280 --> 01:21:38,509
- I didn't hit hard. - We...

2349
01:21:38,510 --> 01:21:40,549
really need to give him a dopamine rush.

2350
01:21:40,550 --> 01:21:41,820
- I know. - Let's go.

2351
01:21:42,020 --> 01:21:43,119
- Let's go. - Two.

2352
01:21:43,120 --> 01:21:44,779
Let's do a cheer together.

2353
01:21:44,780 --> 01:21:46,189
- In 1, 2, 3. - In 1, 2, 3.

2354
01:21:46,190 --> 01:21:47,190
- Let's go. - Let's go.

2355
01:21:47,490 --> 01:21:48,819
This time, give me three balls.

2356
01:21:48,820 --> 01:21:50,300
- Okay. Take three balls. - Go ahead.

2357
01:21:50,760 --> 01:21:52,460
Please.

2358
01:21:52,660 --> 01:21:54,790
Ready. Set.

2359
01:22:02,270 --> 01:22:03,340
All right.

2360
01:22:04,740 --> 01:22:05,940
Hurry up.

2361
01:22:07,540 --> 01:22:08,740
What are we going to do?

2362
01:22:09,280 --> 01:22:10,310
What are we going to do?

2363
01:22:13,080 --> 01:22:15,880
- I'm too pressed for time. - What are we going to do?

2364
01:22:19,990 --> 01:22:21,150
My goodness.

2365
01:22:24,260 --> 01:22:25,930
(2 balls remain.)

2366
01:22:26,330 --> 01:22:27,490
- One ball remains. - Please.

2367
01:22:27,890 --> 01:22:28,930
Hit two cases.

2368
01:22:29,100 --> 01:22:30,100
(They fail with one case remaining.)

2369
01:22:30,101 --> 01:22:31,460
Come on!

2370
01:22:33,200 --> 01:22:34,200
Hit two cases.

2371
01:22:34,201 --> 01:22:37,340
(They only had one more case to go.)

2372
01:22:38,910 --> 01:22:40,310
I should've hit one.

2373
01:22:41,170 --> 01:22:42,239
We were so close.

2374
01:22:42,240 --> 01:22:43,310
We need to go right away.

2375
01:22:43,780 --> 01:22:44,980
He's addicted to dopamine.

2376
01:22:45,850 --> 01:22:47,249
- Doctor. - Let's keep going with this energy.

2377
01:22:47,250 --> 01:22:48,490
- What? - This is the last try.

2378
01:22:48,580 --> 01:22:50,196
- This is the tenth try. - We should be lucky.

2379
01:22:50,220 --> 01:22:51,319
- Doctor. - Yes?

2380
01:22:51,320 --> 01:22:52,989
Please decide on the order and the number of balls.

2381
01:22:52,990 --> 01:22:55,119
- The order. - The order and the number of balls.

2382
01:22:55,120 --> 01:22:56,319
(I've waited for this moment!)

2383
01:22:56,320 --> 01:22:57,660
Come up with a strategy.

2384
01:22:57,920 --> 01:22:59,759
- Tell us what to do. - Come up with a strategy...

2385
01:22:59,760 --> 01:23:02,160
- for us to follow. - He's a strategist in a game.

2386
01:23:02,430 --> 01:23:03,560
Firstly...

2387
01:23:03,830 --> 01:23:05,400
- Three. - Three.

2388
01:23:05,730 --> 01:23:06,830
Three.

2389
01:23:07,270 --> 01:23:08,270
Two and two.

2390
01:23:08,271 --> 01:23:09,370
How about the order?

2391
01:23:09,470 --> 01:23:10,639
One, two, three, four.

2392
01:23:10,640 --> 01:23:11,669
- Okay. - One, two, three, four.

2393
01:23:11,670 --> 01:23:13,210
- Let's go. - Who is going first?

2394
01:23:13,470 --> 01:23:15,339
- In 1, 2, 3. Let's go! - In 1, 2, 3. Let's go!

2395
01:23:15,340 --> 01:23:16,710
Seriously, let's do this.

2396
01:23:16,940 --> 01:23:19,079
We need to switch as soon as possible.

2397
01:23:19,080 --> 01:23:20,179
- Okay. - Move out quickly.

2398
01:23:20,180 --> 01:23:22,649
- After Chae Won hits two balls... - Yes.

2399
01:23:22,650 --> 01:23:23,819
Chae Won will hit 2 balls 1st.

2400
01:23:23,820 --> 01:23:25,949
- I'll enter right away. - Enter right away.

2401
01:23:25,950 --> 01:23:27,019
(All preparations are over!)

2402
01:23:27,020 --> 01:23:28,759
- Good luck, Chae Won. - Okay.

2403
01:23:28,760 --> 01:23:30,360
Knock off one case like you did earlier.

2404
01:23:30,820 --> 01:23:32,690
- Let's go. - Here we go!

2405
01:23:33,090 --> 01:23:34,770
- This is the last try. Ready. - Hit hard.

2406
01:23:34,890 --> 01:23:36,099
- Set. - Should I hit hard?

2407
01:23:36,100 --> 01:23:37,330
It's better to hit hard.

2408
01:23:38,230 --> 01:23:39,530
There you go. That's better.

2409
01:23:39,800 --> 01:23:40,830
What?

2410
01:23:41,270 --> 01:23:42,540
You hit too hard.

2411
01:23:43,700 --> 01:23:46,040
- What? - I need to knock it off.

2412
01:23:47,140 --> 01:23:48,210
Will you hit it gently?

2413
01:23:48,270 --> 01:23:49,980
You need to knock it off.

2414
01:23:50,240 --> 01:23:51,610
- Knock it off! - You did it!

2415
01:23:52,750 --> 01:23:54,049
(He knocks off 1 case!)

2416
01:23:54,050 --> 01:23:55,719
- Yeon Seok, we got this. - We got this.

2417
01:23:55,720 --> 01:23:56,750
Hit one.

2418
01:23:57,180 --> 01:23:58,220
All right.

2419
01:24:01,450 --> 01:24:02,520
Stay calm.

2420
01:24:04,490 --> 01:24:05,730
Ten seconds remain.

2421
01:24:07,160 --> 01:24:08,229
You still have time.

2422
01:24:08,230 --> 01:24:09,360
(Sang Woo is last.)

2423
01:24:11,930 --> 01:24:13,029
Two balls remain.

2424
01:24:13,030 --> 01:24:14,530
You still have time.

2425
01:24:15,000 --> 01:24:16,840
(You should succeed in it on the 10th try!)

2426
01:24:16,970 --> 01:24:18,710
- Two balls remain. - Five, four,

2427
01:24:19,110 --> 01:24:20,110
three...

2428
01:24:21,270 --> 01:24:22,809
I should've knocked it off.

2429
01:24:22,810 --> 01:24:23,939
(They fail.)

2430
01:24:23,940 --> 01:24:26,580
I should've knocked it off!

2431
01:24:28,010 --> 01:24:29,620
I should've knocked it off.

2432
01:24:30,750 --> 01:24:34,020
(I should've knocked it off!)

2433
01:24:36,720 --> 01:24:38,459
- Gosh. - We always succeed one more ball.

2434
01:24:38,460 --> 01:24:40,760
(The production crew takes the prizes.)

2435
01:24:43,230 --> 01:24:46,870
(Thus, the dopamine battle ends.)

2436
01:24:55,610 --> 01:24:56,880
I should've stopped.

2437
01:24:57,680 --> 01:24:59,780
You should've knocked off one case.

2438
01:25:00,110 --> 01:25:02,179
- Gosh, we failed. - I mean...

2439
01:25:02,180 --> 01:25:04,380
(They only have belated regrets.)

2440
01:25:05,220 --> 01:25:07,289
- We failed. - Go back to your patients.

2441
01:25:07,290 --> 01:25:08,320
Okay.

2442
01:25:13,660 --> 01:25:15,660
- Why couldn't I do it? - We just needed one more.

2443
01:25:16,100 --> 01:25:17,200
That's how it is.

2444
01:25:17,800 --> 01:25:19,329
Doctor, I'm sorry.

2445
01:25:19,330 --> 01:25:21,270
Don't be. I had a lot of fun.

2446
01:25:22,040 --> 01:25:23,869
- We couldn't give you dopamine. - We're sorry about that.

2447
01:25:23,870 --> 01:25:25,669
- So... - Thank you.

2448
01:25:25,670 --> 01:25:26,909
I'll use it well.

2449
01:25:26,910 --> 01:25:28,950
(We'll refill your dopamine level with "Heartman.")

2450
01:25:29,110 --> 01:25:31,310
- Doctor, I'm sorry. - Don't be.

2451
01:25:31,480 --> 01:25:33,310
I should've participated in the tenth try.

2452
01:25:34,380 --> 01:25:37,049
- Doctor. Earlier... - He wanted to go last.

2453
01:25:37,050 --> 01:25:38,730
- He's so similar to Jang Hang Jun. - Yes.

2454
01:25:38,950 --> 01:25:44,090
(Jae Suk and Yeon Seok are out of it.)

2455
01:25:44,860 --> 01:25:45,890
(Right.)

2456
01:25:46,160 --> 01:25:47,729
(The two of them make them lose their senses.)

2457
01:25:47,730 --> 01:25:49,699
(HAEWON of NMIXX)

2458
01:25:49,700 --> 01:25:52,200
(SULLYOON of NIMIXX)

2459
01:25:52,270 --> 01:25:54,030
(I came back to Daejeon after a long while.)

2460
01:25:54,470 --> 01:25:55,716
(There are 3 things that represent Daejeon.)

2461
01:25:55,740 --> 01:25:57,170
(Sungsimdang, KAIST, )

2462
01:25:57,340 --> 01:25:58,940
(and SULLYOON)

2463
01:25:59,270 --> 01:26:00,910
(That's how it is, Jae Suk!)

2464
01:26:01,240 --> 01:26:04,240
(Their excitement level rockets from the very start.)

2465
01:26:04,540 --> 01:26:06,179
(Even when Jae Suk nags at them, )

2466
01:26:06,180 --> 01:26:07,780
(they giggle.)

2467
01:26:07,880 --> 01:26:09,380
(In many ways, this is hard.)

2468
01:26:09,850 --> 01:26:12,990
(Even though Haewon is like that, )

2469
01:26:13,620 --> 01:26:16,290
(she becomes small before the game.)

2470
01:26:16,460 --> 01:26:18,260
(I'm traumatized.)

2471
01:26:18,520 --> 01:26:20,830
(She has totally knocked down.)

2472
01:26:21,160 --> 01:26:22,936
(SULLYOON enters instead of the intimidated Haewon.)

2473
01:26:22,960 --> 01:26:25,400
(I think I'm pretty lucky.)

2474
01:26:25,430 --> 01:26:26,829
(Even without practicing, )

2475
01:26:26,830 --> 01:26:28,870
(she succeeds in it.)

2476
01:26:29,070 --> 01:26:30,399
(Even when the game is hard, )

2477
01:26:30,400 --> 01:26:32,170
(she succeeds in it.)

2478
01:26:32,340 --> 01:26:34,310
(Navi Yoo struggles in Daejeon.)

2479
01:26:34,410 --> 01:26:36,510
(Navi SUL fixes the problem!)

2480
01:26:36,640 --> 01:26:37,679
(We can walk there!)

2481
01:26:37,680 --> 01:26:39,110
(Should I call the place?)

2482
01:26:39,280 --> 01:26:40,610
(The trusted daughter of Daejeon)

2483
01:26:40,880 --> 01:26:42,319
(Lucky...)

2484
01:26:42,320 --> 01:26:44,880
(and energetic...)

2485
01:26:45,220 --> 01:26:47,850
(Spare time in Daejeon with these two friends)

2486
01:26:48,290 --> 01:26:50,210
(Whenever Possible, Tuesday, January 20, at 9pm)
