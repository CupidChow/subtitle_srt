1
00:01:48,736 --> 00:01:53,986
(Dear Mr. Heavenly Fox)

2
00:01:54,090 --> 00:01:57,057
(Episode 27)

3
00:03:37,859 --> 00:03:39,162
(Father.)

4
00:03:39,800 --> 00:03:41,162
(As your daughter,)

5
00:03:41,720 --> 00:03:43,362
(I failed to stay by your side.)

6
00:03:44,720 --> 00:03:46,162
(I shall repay your favor)

7
00:03:46,360 --> 00:03:47,922
(of raising me in my next life.)

8
00:04:20,559 --> 00:04:22,633
After your parents left,

9
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:25,842
I secretly swore in my heart

10
00:04:27,200 --> 00:04:28,522
that in this life,

11
00:04:29,440 --> 00:04:31,762
I must make myself stronger

12
00:04:32,982 --> 00:04:34,722
so that I can protect you forever

13
00:04:35,802 --> 00:04:37,802
and never let anyone bully you again.

14
00:04:39,239 --> 00:04:40,682
But now, it seems

15
00:04:42,920 --> 00:04:44,562
I'm going to break my promise.

16
00:04:47,359 --> 00:04:48,802
Xue Han Yu.

17
00:04:49,440 --> 00:04:50,440
Stop moving.

18
00:04:55,640 --> 00:04:56,640
Fortunately,

19
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:00,682
there's another girl here to protect you for me.

20
00:05:03,960 --> 00:05:05,042
Xue Han Yu,

21
00:05:05,359 --> 00:05:06,922
she's a kind girl.

22
00:05:07,504 --> 00:05:08,802
When you get better,

23
00:05:09,058 --> 00:05:10,562
you must treat her well.

24
00:05:11,959 --> 00:05:13,162
Otherwise,

25
00:05:14,137 --> 00:05:16,042
I'll get out of my grave at night

26
00:05:16,343 --> 00:05:18,042
and beat you up in your dreams.

27
00:05:18,279 --> 00:05:19,482
Do you hear me?

28
00:05:41,959 --> 00:05:43,602
The ones I love

29
00:05:44,200 --> 00:05:45,922
are now all in Beiming.

30
00:05:47,311 --> 00:05:51,242
I hope we can meet again in the next life.

31
00:06:11,466 --> 00:06:12,232
Yuan Bao.

32
00:06:12,799 --> 00:06:13,398
Yuan Bao.

33
00:06:13,959 --> 00:06:14,565
Yuan Bao!

34
00:06:16,480 --> 00:06:17,302
Yuan Bao!

35
00:06:18,107 --> 00:06:18,829
Yuan Bao!

36
00:06:23,279 --> 00:06:25,898
- Sect Leader Qi.   - Mr. Chang Yue, have you seen Yuan Bao?

37
00:06:29,920 --> 00:06:31,482
She must have gone to Suiyue Mountain.

38
00:06:57,640 --> 00:07:00,082
Why does this place feel so familiar?

39
00:07:00,878 --> 00:07:04,232
Could it be that I've been here before?

40
00:07:05,554 --> 00:07:07,275
Why are you being so unreasonable?

41
00:07:07,403 --> 00:07:08,688
This thing is clearly...

42
00:07:22,184 --> 00:07:23,427
Ah.

43
00:07:25,080 --> 00:07:27,082
This is where he and I met.

44
00:07:34,008 --> 00:07:35,171
Chang Yue.

45
00:07:35,552 --> 00:07:37,042
Who knew

46
00:07:37,510 --> 00:07:39,042
that our bond

47
00:07:40,200 --> 00:07:41,882
would start here,

48
00:07:43,920 --> 00:07:45,362
and end here?

49
00:09:13,192 --> 00:09:14,811
Corpse Puppet King,

50
00:09:15,312 --> 00:09:17,322
you've been asleep for so many years.

51
00:09:17,605 --> 00:09:19,042
It's time to wake up.

52
00:09:50,400 --> 00:09:51,762
Everyone, hurry up.

53
00:09:51,960 --> 00:09:52,960
Keep up!

54
00:10:06,158 --> 00:10:06,773
Qian Qian,

55
00:10:08,359 --> 00:10:09,602
why did you tie me up?

56
00:10:09,720 --> 00:10:11,762
- Xue Han Yu!   - Han Yu, you're back.

57
00:10:12,738 --> 00:10:14,242
You're back!

58
00:10:14,923 --> 00:10:15,867
- Hooray!   - Untie me.

59
00:10:15,892 --> 00:10:18,286
- What's going on?   - You're back!

60
00:10:23,585 --> 00:10:24,186
Come.

61
00:10:25,073 --> 00:10:26,360
- Let's go.   - Where is this place?

62
00:10:26,440 --> 00:10:28,453
You wouldn't understand even if I told you. Come.

63
00:10:28,578 --> 00:10:29,974
- What's going on?   - The rope.

64
00:10:29,999 --> 00:10:31,301
- Calm down. Tell me.   - Quick.

65
00:10:31,326 --> 00:10:32,015
Why did you tie me up?

66
00:10:49,880 --> 00:10:51,122
Yuan Bao.

67
00:11:09,731 --> 00:11:11,282
Spirit particle.

68
00:11:15,799 --> 00:11:17,882
I've been waiting for you for a long time.

69
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:20,682
You've finally come.

70
00:11:25,176 --> 00:11:27,082
Sect Leader Qi, what exactly is going on?

71
00:11:27,348 --> 00:11:29,282
The Corpse Puppet King has appeared.

72
00:11:37,968 --> 00:11:40,362
If this continues, we will all die here!

73
00:11:42,919 --> 00:11:44,002
(No,)

74
00:11:44,126 --> 00:11:46,082
(I will never let you succeed!)

75
00:11:52,315 --> 00:11:54,643
Mr. Qi, what is Qi Yuan Bao doing?

76
00:11:54,744 --> 00:11:58,562
She wants to absorb all the demonic energy from the Corpse Puppet King.

77
00:11:58,733 --> 00:11:59,878
Is she crazy?

78
00:12:00,919 --> 00:12:02,240
If this continues, Yuan Bao will die.

79
00:12:02,320 --> 00:12:03,399
We must stop her.

80
00:12:03,519 --> 00:12:05,002
- Stop her!   - No!

81
00:12:10,440 --> 00:12:12,313
This is Yuan Bao's own choice.

82
00:12:13,578 --> 00:12:14,922
Only she

83
00:12:15,245 --> 00:12:17,562
can save the world.

84
00:12:19,239 --> 00:12:20,682
Spirit particle,

85
00:12:21,160 --> 00:12:22,802
just give up.

86
00:12:23,039 --> 00:12:25,442
You'll only explode and die if you continue.

87
00:12:25,640 --> 00:12:27,642
All this for these stupid humans,

88
00:12:28,440 --> 00:12:29,472
is it worth it?

89
00:12:29,632 --> 00:12:32,833
I don't need to explain myself to you.

90
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:33,805
Fine.

91
00:12:34,584 --> 00:12:37,522
Then don't regret your choice.

92
00:12:46,538 --> 00:12:49,362
You can have my life.

93
00:12:49,769 --> 00:12:52,602
But I'm taking your life too!

94
00:13:19,760 --> 00:13:21,240
- Yuan Bao!   - Yuan Bao!

95
00:13:21,320 --> 00:13:22,320
- Yuan Bao!   - Yuan Bao!

96
00:13:22,479 --> 00:13:23,479
Yuan Bao!

97
00:13:23,640 --> 00:13:24,640
Yuan Bao!

98
00:13:27,172 --> 00:13:28,172
- Yuan Bao!   - Yuan Bao!

99
00:13:28,199 --> 00:13:29,199
- Yuan Bao!   - Yuan Bao!

100
00:13:30,559 --> 00:13:31,559
- Yuan Bao!   - Yuan Bao!

101
00:13:32,039 --> 00:13:33,479
- This can't be it.   - Uncle Qi.

102
00:13:33,504 --> 00:13:34,272
Yuan Bao.

103
00:13:34,799 --> 00:13:36,399
This can't be it. Hang in there.

104
00:13:36,424 --> 00:13:37,234
Hang in there!

105
00:13:40,854 --> 00:13:42,028
Hang in there!

106
00:13:42,712 --> 00:13:43,407
Yuan Bao.

107
00:13:44,486 --> 00:13:47,082
Uncle Qi, think of a way to save Yuan Bao!

108
00:13:47,574 --> 00:13:49,766
What do we do? She's almost gone.

109
00:13:49,935 --> 00:13:51,495
Sect Leader Qi, please save Yuan Bao.

110
00:13:51,520 --> 00:13:52,881
- Save Yuan Bao.   - Save Yuan Bao.

111
00:13:52,962 --> 00:13:54,160
Save Yuan Bao, Master.

112
00:13:54,316 --> 00:13:56,196
Perhaps there's a way to save her.

113
00:13:57,079 --> 00:13:59,712
But it's extremely dangerous and may not work.

114
00:14:00,200 --> 00:14:02,000
Sect Leader Qi, whatever the method,

115
00:14:02,103 --> 00:14:03,322
I'm willing to try.

116
00:14:03,689 --> 00:14:05,922
Yu Ying once left behind a pentagram formation.

117
00:14:06,359 --> 00:14:09,162
It might suppress the demonic energy within Yuan Bao.

118
00:14:09,599 --> 00:14:10,839
But to activate this formation,

119
00:14:10,988 --> 00:14:14,762
it requires five individuals with extremely profound power.

120
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:16,000
Not one fewer.

121
00:14:16,118 --> 00:14:17,799
I can do it.

122
00:14:17,934 --> 00:14:20,406
But we still need three more.

123
00:14:20,527 --> 00:14:21,599
I can do it.

124
00:14:21,679 --> 00:14:23,120
Me too. I can do anything!

125
00:14:23,200 --> 00:14:24,753
- I can do it.   - We can too, Master!

126
00:14:24,840 --> 00:14:26,002
You can't.

127
00:14:26,440 --> 00:14:27,562
Your power is too weak.

128
00:14:27,679 --> 00:14:29,552
Entering the formation would result in immediate death.

129
00:14:32,239 --> 00:14:33,802
What about us two?

130
00:14:37,239 --> 00:14:38,682
Qi, me too.

131
00:14:39,080 --> 00:14:40,440
Thank you for offering your help.

132
00:14:40,566 --> 00:14:42,559
Right, let's save ugly freak first.

133
00:14:56,960 --> 00:14:58,162
(Qi Lian,)

134
00:14:58,479 --> 00:15:00,202
(I will never let you get your way.)

135
00:15:00,334 --> 00:15:01,449
(Qi Yuan Bao,)

136
00:15:01,760 --> 00:15:03,362
(haven't you always wanted to know)

137
00:15:03,481 --> 00:15:05,122
(how your mother died?)

138
00:15:05,280 --> 00:15:07,080
Yuan Bao, focus!

139
00:15:07,275 --> 00:15:08,842
Yuan Bao, hang in there!

140
00:15:09,370 --> 00:15:10,562
(Qi Yuan Bao,)

141
00:15:10,799 --> 00:15:12,753
(do you know why your father killed your mother?)

142
00:15:13,520 --> 00:15:15,082
(It's all because of you.)

143
00:15:15,616 --> 00:15:17,169
(You are a jinx.)

144
00:15:17,359 --> 00:15:18,882
(You were born with demonic energy.)

145
00:15:19,799 --> 00:15:22,682
(Xue Yu Ying became a demon to save you back then.)

146
00:15:23,062 --> 00:15:25,482
(Your father had no choice but to kill her.)

147
00:15:26,154 --> 00:15:29,672
(You are the one who killed your mother.)

148
00:15:29,912 --> 00:15:31,122
Mother.

149
00:15:34,393 --> 00:15:36,082
Something's not right.

150
00:15:38,416 --> 00:15:39,578
Yuan Bao.

151
00:15:39,759 --> 00:15:41,322
- Come.   - Mother.

152
00:15:41,520 --> 00:15:42,839
Eat something before you train.

153
00:15:42,919 --> 00:15:44,296
Why can't I get this technique right?

154
00:15:44,377 --> 00:15:45,999
No matter how much I practice!

155
00:15:46,119 --> 00:15:48,122
Don't rush. Take it slow.

156
00:15:48,400 --> 00:15:50,993
But I don't want to disappoint Father.

157
00:15:52,400 --> 00:15:53,712
You silly child.

158
00:15:53,880 --> 00:15:56,842
You will always be our pride.

159
00:15:59,347 --> 00:16:00,502
Oh, no.

160
00:16:00,640 --> 00:16:02,096
If Yuan Bao can't endure this,

161
00:16:02,244 --> 00:16:04,598
the formation will backfire on everyone here.

162
00:16:04,718 --> 00:16:06,242
What should we do?

163
00:16:08,664 --> 00:16:09,882
Mr. Huo!

164
00:16:14,280 --> 00:16:15,280
Sir.

165
00:16:20,400 --> 00:16:21,839
Yuan Bao, I'm going to save you!

166
00:16:21,934 --> 00:16:23,242
Xue Han Yu!

167
00:16:23,840 --> 00:16:24,840
Me too.

168
00:16:31,192 --> 00:16:32,602
Enough. Get out now.

169
00:16:32,769 --> 00:16:34,562
Sect Leader Qi, save Yuan Bao!

170
00:16:34,641 --> 00:16:36,298
- Save Yuan Bao!   - Hang in there!

171
00:16:36,379 --> 00:16:37,379
Yuan Bao!

172
00:16:46,187 --> 00:16:47,078
Yuan Bao.

173
00:16:47,322 --> 00:16:48,112
Yuan Bao!

174
00:16:51,465 --> 00:16:52,465
Yuan Bao.

175
00:17:35,873 --> 00:17:37,162
It's all right now.

176
00:17:42,383 --> 00:17:44,762
My dear Qi, it's been so long.

177
00:17:45,055 --> 00:17:46,402
Meng Shu,

178
00:17:47,079 --> 00:17:48,762
it really is you.

179
00:17:50,239 --> 00:17:52,592
Look at those self-important fools.

180
00:17:52,768 --> 00:17:54,521
They think they saved Qi Yuan Bao.

181
00:17:55,520 --> 00:17:58,762
But they don't know that with their meager spiritual power,

182
00:17:59,040 --> 00:18:01,802
the pentagram formation has not worked as effectively.

183
00:18:03,199 --> 00:18:04,522
One day,

184
00:18:04,760 --> 00:18:06,202
their hero

185
00:18:06,400 --> 00:18:08,841
will become a demon they fear.

186
00:18:08,967 --> 00:18:11,599
Yu Ying and I have always considered you a close friend,

187
00:18:11,732 --> 00:18:13,721
but I never expected you to be so vicious.

188
00:18:13,873 --> 00:18:14,873
Vicious?

189
00:18:16,792 --> 00:18:20,832
I'll make sure Qi Yuan Bao's joy, sorrow,

190
00:18:21,225 --> 00:18:23,505
pain, and happiness,

191
00:18:23,639 --> 00:18:25,319
are all out of her control.

192
00:18:25,470 --> 00:18:26,038
You...

193
00:18:27,959 --> 00:18:28,818
Qi Lian,

194
00:18:29,239 --> 00:18:31,352
this is the consequence of your betrayal!

195
00:18:39,278 --> 00:18:40,278
You...

196
00:18:41,251 --> 00:18:42,682
Why are you doing this?

197
00:18:42,865 --> 00:18:44,818
I want to die by your hand,

198
00:18:46,839 --> 00:18:50,352
so you'll feel guilty for the rest of your life.

199
00:19:02,239 --> 00:19:03,239
Mother.

200
00:19:04,680 --> 00:19:05,680
Mother!

201
00:19:06,392 --> 00:19:07,392
Wake up.

202
00:19:08,239 --> 00:19:09,239
Yuan Bao.

203
00:19:13,199 --> 00:19:14,522
Chang Yue.

204
00:19:14,719 --> 00:19:16,002
Another nightmare?

205
00:19:18,832 --> 00:19:20,074
Chang Yue.

206
00:19:20,533 --> 00:19:21,842
I'm not dead yet.

207
00:19:23,306 --> 00:19:24,306
It's okay.

208
00:19:25,599 --> 00:19:26,962
You are safe now.

209
00:19:35,943 --> 00:19:38,002
By the way, what about the others?

210
00:19:38,136 --> 00:19:39,482
Are they all right?

211
00:19:40,063 --> 00:19:41,063
Don't worry,

212
00:19:41,239 --> 00:19:42,922
everyone else is fine.

213
00:19:43,400 --> 00:19:44,400
Father.

214
00:19:48,175 --> 00:19:49,338
Sect Leader Qi.

215
00:19:49,479 --> 00:19:51,282
I'll head out and give you some privacy.

216
00:20:04,959 --> 00:20:05,959
Grandmother Bi Xi.

217
00:20:08,560 --> 00:20:09,560
Grandmother Bi Xi.

218
00:20:09,640 --> 00:20:11,560
How are you feeling? Are you hurt?

219
00:20:11,640 --> 00:20:13,472
How could that kind of formation do anything to me?

220
00:20:15,119 --> 00:20:16,472
Anyway, that Qi Yuan Bao

221
00:20:16,680 --> 00:20:18,072
looks fragile

222
00:20:18,239 --> 00:20:19,633
and has mediocre power.

223
00:20:20,800 --> 00:20:21,800
How is she?

224
00:20:23,839 --> 00:20:24,873
I appreciate your concern.

225
00:20:25,319 --> 00:20:26,319
She's fine now.

226
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:28,393
When was I concerned about her?

227
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:33,512
What is this?

228
00:20:34,652 --> 00:20:36,873
This is the invigorating honey I got from Yi Xuan.

229
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:38,673
It helps with restoration.

230
00:20:41,640 --> 00:20:42,712
Allow me to thank you

231
00:20:43,119 --> 00:20:44,119
on behalf of Yuan Bao.

232
00:20:47,119 --> 00:20:48,119
Now,

233
00:20:48,319 --> 00:20:49,913
I'll take Hong Zhen back to Beiming.

234
00:20:51,560 --> 00:20:52,560
What about you?

235
00:20:53,560 --> 00:20:55,633
I'll take Yuan Bao back to Qishan Sect first.

236
00:20:56,359 --> 00:20:57,472
After she recovers,

237
00:20:58,000 --> 00:20:59,640
I'll take her with me to Beiming to see you.

238
00:21:00,199 --> 00:21:01,199
I didn't say

239
00:21:01,680 --> 00:21:03,472
I'd allow her back into Beiming.

240
00:21:09,359 --> 00:21:10,359
Father.

241
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:12,000
I'm sorry.

242
00:21:12,719 --> 00:21:13,719
So

243
00:21:14,079 --> 00:21:15,952
my mother did all that for me back then.

244
00:21:17,359 --> 00:21:19,279
You've been hiding this from me all these years

245
00:21:19,359 --> 00:21:21,432
because you wanted to spare me the pain.

246
00:21:22,319 --> 00:21:24,359
But I kept going against you

247
00:21:24,439 --> 00:21:25,592
and making you angry.

248
00:21:26,560 --> 00:21:27,793
I'm really sorry.

249
00:21:31,479 --> 00:21:33,232
Come. Get up.

250
00:21:44,199 --> 00:21:45,199
Back then,

251
00:21:46,079 --> 00:21:48,080
after your uncle and aunt left,

252
00:21:48,160 --> 00:21:49,993
your mother was heartbroken.

253
00:21:51,319 --> 00:21:53,393
Luckily, she was pregnant with you.

254
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:57,432
Your mother's only wish in life

255
00:21:57,920 --> 00:22:00,359
was for you to live safely

256
00:22:00,439 --> 00:22:02,153
and honestly.

257
00:22:03,439 --> 00:22:05,072
You did well today.

258
00:22:05,800 --> 00:22:08,153
I'm proud of you.

259
00:22:11,599 --> 00:22:12,879
If your mother

260
00:22:12,959 --> 00:22:13,959
knows about this,

261
00:22:14,920 --> 00:22:16,472
she will be very gratified too.

262
00:22:20,719 --> 00:22:22,251
Come, Yuan Bao.

263
00:22:22,400 --> 00:22:24,279
I made fennel dumplings

264
00:22:24,304 --> 00:22:25,304
especially for you.

265
00:22:25,880 --> 00:22:26,880
Try them.

266
00:22:27,599 --> 00:22:29,009
Although they're not as good,

267
00:22:29,719 --> 00:22:31,592
as your mother's, it's the thoughts that matter.

268
00:22:35,680 --> 00:22:36,680
Come.

269
00:22:47,719 --> 00:22:48,719
Is it good?

270
00:22:51,560 --> 00:22:52,560
It's good.

271
00:22:57,800 --> 00:22:59,793
(To my beloved Qi,)

272
00:23:00,160 --> 00:23:02,913
- Father.   - We have been married for over a decade.

273
00:23:03,839 --> 00:23:05,192
(We share a deep bond.)

274
00:23:07,160 --> 00:23:08,312
(Marrying you)

275
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:10,432
(and bearing Yuan Bao)

276
00:23:11,199 --> 00:23:12,993
(are the best things that happened in my life.)

277
00:23:15,119 --> 00:23:16,633
(When Yuan Bao was born,)

278
00:23:17,400 --> 00:23:19,673
(I knew she was the spirit particle incarnate,)

279
00:23:20,119 --> 00:23:21,472
(yet tainted with demonic energy.)

280
00:23:22,560 --> 00:23:25,712
(She wouldn't be with us for long.)

281
00:23:27,400 --> 00:23:29,472
(Yuan Bao has been smart and clever since she was little.)

282
00:23:29,719 --> 00:23:30,913
(She is pure and optimistic.)

283
00:23:31,959 --> 00:23:34,712
(She is like a spring breeze in March,)

284
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:36,192
(a drizzle in June.)

285
00:23:37,479 --> 00:23:38,793
(She grew in me.)

286
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:42,192
(How could I see her go this soon?)

287
00:23:45,520 --> 00:23:46,520
(Therefore,)

288
00:23:48,040 --> 00:23:50,072
(I took the demonic energy from her body.)

289
00:23:50,359 --> 00:23:53,153
- Mother.   - I am willing to bear her pain.

290
00:23:55,000 --> 00:23:57,952
(But after taking the demonic energy,)

291
00:23:58,479 --> 00:24:01,472
(I gradually felt unwell. I'm losing control,)

292
00:24:01,839 --> 00:24:03,033
(unable to stop myself.)

293
00:24:04,079 --> 00:24:06,592
(I fear that one day it will lead to disaster.)

294
00:24:08,160 --> 00:24:10,080
(The Xue clan is a great cultivator family)

295
00:24:10,160 --> 00:24:12,633
(that has protected the people and the country for generations.)

296
00:24:13,280 --> 00:24:15,352
(I must not commit heinous crimes.)

297
00:24:16,640 --> 00:24:19,592
(If one day I harm the innocent,)

298
00:24:20,400 --> 00:24:22,393
(please, my love, forego our bond)

299
00:24:22,680 --> 00:24:23,993
(and prioritize the greater good.)

300
00:24:24,319 --> 00:24:25,553
(Kill me decisively.)

301
00:24:27,479 --> 00:24:30,273
(From your wife, Xue Yu Ying.)

302
00:24:33,479 --> 00:24:34,479
Hungry.

303
00:24:46,978 --> 00:24:48,033
Thirsty.

304
00:24:50,119 --> 00:24:51,119
Come.

305
00:24:56,560 --> 00:24:57,712
Hungry,

306
00:25:00,560 --> 00:25:01,560
Come.

307
00:25:04,599 --> 00:25:05,599
Wait.

308
00:25:06,839 --> 00:25:07,839
Why are you pretending?

309
00:25:08,040 --> 00:25:09,352
You're not a thrall anymore.

310
00:25:09,640 --> 00:25:10,640
Eat it yourself.

311
00:25:12,439 --> 00:25:14,753
Just say you're lazy. Why make so many excuses?

312
00:25:15,640 --> 00:25:16,793
It seems that

313
00:25:17,040 --> 00:25:18,680
being a thrall

314
00:25:18,760 --> 00:25:19,760
is better.

315
00:25:22,679 --> 00:25:24,839
Qi Yuan Bao risked her life to save you.

316
00:25:25,959 --> 00:25:27,793
If you say that,

317
00:25:27,920 --> 00:25:28,592
I'll tell on her.

318
00:25:29,239 --> 00:25:30,018
Right.

319
00:25:30,880 --> 00:25:32,793
Luckily, Yuan Bao came out unscathed.

320
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:34,439
Otherwise, I would feel so guilty.

321
00:25:36,400 --> 00:25:38,312
Now that you've found Yuan Bao,

322
00:25:38,972 --> 00:25:41,633
are we all going back to Qishan Sect together?

323
00:25:46,173 --> 00:25:47,173
Yes,

324
00:25:47,400 --> 00:25:48,913
let's go back to Qishan Sect together.

325
00:25:49,520 --> 00:25:51,913
We'll wait until Yuan Bao gets better.

326
00:25:53,760 --> 00:25:54,760
Then,

327
00:25:55,160 --> 00:25:56,160
what are your plans?

328
00:26:01,880 --> 00:26:02,880
Xue Han Yu!

329
00:26:04,520 --> 00:26:05,520
What's wrong with me?

330
00:26:08,400 --> 00:26:10,312
I... we...

331
00:26:10,719 --> 00:26:12,840
We... we're already...

332
00:26:12,920 --> 00:26:13,920
like this.

333
00:26:14,599 --> 00:26:15,832
Why are you asking me this question?

334
00:26:16,239 --> 00:26:17,239
We're already like what?

335
00:26:20,079 --> 00:26:21,112
I don't want to talk to you.

336
00:26:21,613 --> 00:26:22,613
Get up. Get out.

337
00:26:22,760 --> 00:26:23,880
- All right.   - Go away.

338
00:26:23,960 --> 00:26:25,112
All right.

339
00:26:25,280 --> 00:26:26,280
Stop it.

340
00:26:26,920 --> 00:26:27,920
Say it.

341
00:26:28,239 --> 00:26:29,513
What are we now?

342
00:26:31,192 --> 00:26:32,192
We are...

343
00:26:33,199 --> 00:26:34,199
Say it out loud.

344
00:26:36,687 --> 00:26:37,687
I don't know.

345
00:26:39,920 --> 00:26:40,920
Fine, I'm leaving.

346
00:26:44,966 --> 00:26:46,398
Say it! What are we?

347
00:26:48,479 --> 00:26:49,479
Xue Han Yu,

348
00:26:50,560 --> 00:26:51,639
I think you should be

349
00:26:51,719 --> 00:26:52,719
a thrall.

350
00:26:53,599 --> 00:26:55,680
You're cute and brainless.

351
00:26:55,760 --> 00:26:56,760
How great is that?

352
00:26:57,119 --> 00:26:58,999
Should I bite you?

353
00:26:59,079 --> 00:27:00,079
See if you can turn back.

354
00:27:01,119 --> 00:27:02,273
Stop!

355
00:27:02,479 --> 00:27:03,601
Don't bite! No!

356
00:27:03,681 --> 00:27:04,913
Stop!

357
00:27:09,920 --> 00:27:11,033
You're like a dog.

358
00:27:21,239 --> 00:27:22,615
What are you doing? I didn't steal

359
00:27:22,640 --> 00:27:24,439
the chicken drumstick. It wasn't me.

360
00:27:29,599 --> 00:27:31,352
- Come.   - Xue.

361
00:27:31,599 --> 00:27:33,432
You saved Yuan Bao.

362
00:27:33,640 --> 00:27:35,920
You are now

363
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:37,432
my benefactor!

364
00:27:37,680 --> 00:27:39,273
Yes, benefactor!

365
00:27:39,560 --> 00:27:41,072
I thought something happened.

366
00:27:41,239 --> 00:27:42,873
You're also a hero

367
00:27:43,079 --> 00:27:44,880
- of our sect.   - Yes!

368
00:27:44,960 --> 00:27:46,753
A great hero!

369
00:27:46,920 --> 00:27:48,921
- A great hero!   - A great hero!

370
00:27:49,001 --> 00:27:50,112
No, I don't deserve it.

371
00:27:50,239 --> 00:27:51,712
I'm not a hero.

372
00:27:51,839 --> 00:27:53,873
I definitely

373
00:27:54,040 --> 00:27:55,680
couldn't have done it alone.

374
00:27:55,760 --> 00:27:56,800
You're too modest.

375
00:27:56,880 --> 00:27:58,359
Too modest.

376
00:27:58,439 --> 00:27:59,712
It's all thanks

377
00:27:59,880 --> 00:28:02,192
to our collective effort.

378
00:28:03,319 --> 00:28:04,680
- Have this.   - It's all thanks to you.

379
00:28:04,760 --> 00:28:05,760
You're too modest.

380
00:28:07,359 --> 00:28:08,720
Let me give you a massage. Come.

381
00:28:08,800 --> 00:28:10,320
- Too modest.   - It's a bit sore here.

382
00:28:10,400 --> 00:28:11,784
Give it a massage.

383
00:28:11,864 --> 00:28:13,000
- Come.   - My waist.

384
00:28:13,080 --> 00:28:14,252
Sure.

385
00:28:29,640 --> 00:28:30,640
(Mother,)

386
00:28:32,479 --> 00:28:33,873
(I miss you so much.)

387
00:28:38,853 --> 00:28:39,853
(Don't worry,)

388
00:28:41,160 --> 00:28:43,312
(I will work hard to be a daughter you're proud of.)

389
00:28:50,239 --> 00:28:51,239
What are you doing?

390
00:28:54,246 --> 00:28:55,052
Prince Yan.

391
00:28:55,959 --> 00:28:57,952
Thank you for saving me today.

392
00:28:58,119 --> 00:28:58,932
You're amazing.

393
00:29:00,199 --> 00:29:01,352
As if I'm not amazing already.

394
00:29:02,239 --> 00:29:03,239
You are amazing.

395
00:29:03,640 --> 00:29:05,913
You are especially amazing today.

396
00:29:10,079 --> 00:29:10,747
I'm leaving.

397
00:29:12,839 --> 00:29:13,390
Then...

398
00:29:14,439 --> 00:29:16,393
Just go. No one's stopping you.

399
00:29:16,680 --> 00:29:17,230
You...

400
00:29:18,520 --> 00:29:19,520
I see.

401
00:29:19,920 --> 00:29:20,598
You'll miss me.

402
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:23,320
Why would I miss you?

403
00:29:23,400 --> 00:29:25,199
Don't flatter yourself.

404
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:29,553
But I'm actually quite sad to see you go.

405
00:29:32,160 --> 00:29:33,720
I'll definitely come to Beiming in the future

406
00:29:33,800 --> 00:29:34,800
to visit you.

407
00:29:44,319 --> 00:29:45,319
It's a promise then.

408
00:29:45,560 --> 00:29:47,832
If you don't visit me, I'll come to Qishan Sect to kidnap you.

409
00:29:49,040 --> 00:29:50,040
It's a promise then.

410
00:30:10,040 --> 00:30:11,040
Follow me.

411
00:30:12,319 --> 00:30:14,192
- Where are we going?   - You'll find out soon enough.

412
00:30:15,560 --> 00:30:16,592
Let's go. Don't look back.

413
00:30:20,319 --> 00:30:22,159
Master, Yuan Bao and Mr. Chang Yue

414
00:30:22,239 --> 00:30:23,239
are going somewhere.

415
00:30:25,079 --> 00:30:26,192
Let them be.

416
00:30:45,520 --> 00:30:46,993
Qi Yuan Bao is so shameless.

417
00:30:47,920 --> 00:30:49,913
She left everyone behind just for a kiss.

418
00:31:07,199 --> 00:31:08,199
I can do that too.

419
00:31:23,800 --> 00:31:24,800
What the heck?

420
00:32:24,800 --> 00:32:25,800
Are you okay?

421
00:32:26,560 --> 00:32:27,920
- Are you two okay?   - Are you okay?

422
00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:30,119
I told you not to play too long. What if you catch a cold?

423
00:32:30,199 --> 00:32:31,432
It wasn't me.

424
00:32:32,599 --> 00:32:33,599
It was Qi Yuan Bao's fault.

425
00:32:34,319 --> 00:32:36,239
We agreed not to wet our faces. But she did it anyway.

426
00:32:36,920 --> 00:32:38,553
Did I ever splash water on you?

427
00:32:38,719 --> 00:32:40,673
It was Xue Han Yu who did it, okay?

428
00:32:40,913 --> 00:32:41,913
I didn't.

429
00:32:46,760 --> 00:32:47,952
Chang Yue,

430
00:32:49,192 --> 00:32:51,632
is my roasted chicken ready yet?

431
00:32:51,664 --> 00:32:52,277
It's ready.

432
00:32:52,920 --> 00:32:53,630
Come.

433
00:32:54,850 --> 00:32:55,921
- Be careful, it's hot.   - Yu.

434
00:32:56,001 --> 00:32:57,840
Is my fish ready yet?

435
00:32:57,920 --> 00:32:59,520
It's done. Here, be careful.

436
00:33:48,079 --> 00:33:49,079
Sect Leader Qi,

437
00:33:49,239 --> 00:33:50,239
what is this?

438
00:33:50,719 --> 00:33:52,720
This is a magical artifact left behind by the Xue clan,

439
00:33:52,800 --> 00:33:53,800
the Kongtong Cauldron.

440
00:33:54,119 --> 00:33:56,153
It can absorb the Corpse Puppet King's demonic energy.

441
00:33:56,640 --> 00:33:57,640
If that's the case,

442
00:33:58,079 --> 00:33:59,513
doesn't that mean Yuan Bao can be saved?

443
00:34:01,040 --> 00:34:02,322
Back then,

444
00:34:02,768 --> 00:34:04,087
Yu Ying used this magical artifact

445
00:34:04,199 --> 00:34:06,202
to draw out the demonic energy from Yuan Bao's body.

446
00:34:06,439 --> 00:34:07,722
But she herself

447
00:34:09,159 --> 00:34:11,232
was corrupted by the demonic energy.

448
00:34:11,439 --> 00:34:13,922
Does this mean that the demonic energy

449
00:34:14,246 --> 00:34:16,202
can never be completely eliminated?

450
00:34:17,132 --> 00:34:18,209
No matter what,

451
00:34:18,545 --> 00:34:20,397
- I must save Yuan Bao.   - But...
