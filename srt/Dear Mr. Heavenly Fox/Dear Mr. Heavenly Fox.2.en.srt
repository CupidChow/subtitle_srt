1
00:01:48,882 --> 00:01:54,012
(Dear Mr. Heavenly Fox)

2
00:01:54,095 --> 00:01:56,995
(Episode 2)

3
00:01:57,599 --> 00:01:59,706
Did I say you could leave now?

4
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:08,065
Qi Yuan Bao, you have no shame.

5
00:02:08,160 --> 00:02:09,282
You brought backup.

6
00:02:12,559 --> 00:02:13,592
My flowers!

7
00:03:28,119 --> 00:03:29,425
What a handsome young man.

8
00:03:50,025 --> 00:03:52,002
Thank you for saving me, mister.

9
00:03:55,552 --> 00:03:57,172
Shen Shen, you're finally here.

10
00:03:57,253 --> 00:03:59,199
You have to teach Qi Yuan Bao a lesson.

11
00:03:59,960 --> 00:04:00,993
You...

12
00:04:01,559 --> 00:04:02,785
You started it.

13
00:04:02,960 --> 00:04:03,993
You...

14
00:04:05,880 --> 00:04:06,913
Miss Su.

15
00:04:07,199 --> 00:04:08,402
Long time no see.

16
00:04:16,022 --> 00:04:17,728
Mister, you're so skilled.

17
00:04:17,830 --> 00:04:19,977
May I ask which sect you belong to?

18
00:04:29,397 --> 00:04:30,522
Look.

19
00:04:32,550 --> 00:04:33,882
He's flying so high.

20
00:04:36,679 --> 00:04:37,746
Yuan Bao.

21
00:04:37,959 --> 00:04:38,992
Move.

22
00:04:39,160 --> 00:04:40,193
Yuan Bao.

23
00:04:42,880 --> 00:04:43,913
Shen Shen.

24
00:04:45,239 --> 00:04:47,145
Since you ask sincerely,

25
00:04:47,308 --> 00:04:49,219
I'll let you have the answer.

26
00:04:49,600 --> 00:04:51,865
Open your eyes and see carefully.

27
00:04:53,042 --> 00:04:55,962
(Taiyi Mountain)

28
00:04:58,386 --> 00:05:00,259
Mister, slow down.

29
00:05:02,839 --> 00:05:05,865
Sir, have we met somewhere before?

30
00:05:06,119 --> 00:05:07,633
- No.   - No?

31
00:05:08,886 --> 00:05:09,601
I see.

32
00:05:10,061 --> 00:05:12,458
I would never forget

33
00:05:12,539 --> 00:05:14,825
someone with such an extraordinary presence like you.

34
00:05:15,129 --> 00:05:16,129
Frivolous.

35
00:05:16,239 --> 00:05:17,677
I was just telling the truth.

36
00:05:17,760 --> 00:05:19,602
How can you say I'm frivolous?

37
00:05:23,519 --> 00:05:25,226
Hu Bu Lin, do it.

38
00:05:30,890 --> 00:05:32,802
Yuan Bao, where are you?

39
00:05:34,119 --> 00:05:35,119
I'm here.

40
00:05:35,199 --> 00:05:37,312
- Where are you?   - I'm here.

41
00:05:44,640 --> 00:05:45,756
Yuan Bao, are you okay?

42
00:05:45,839 --> 00:05:47,082
Are you hurt?

43
00:05:47,839 --> 00:05:49,282
I'm fine, I won't die.

44
00:05:49,440 --> 00:05:50,705
What about your benefactor?

45
00:05:51,357 --> 00:05:52,842
He kidnapped you and brought you here.

46
00:05:53,040 --> 00:05:54,402
Did he do anything to you?

47
00:05:54,679 --> 00:05:56,066
He did try to attack me.

48
00:05:56,320 --> 00:05:57,906
But he didn't hurt me in the end.

49
00:05:58,799 --> 00:06:00,961
But he just saved you. Why would he attack you?

50
00:06:01,042 --> 00:06:03,188
I wonder too. You'll have to ask them.

51
00:06:04,914 --> 00:06:06,436
Never mind. Let's go back.

52
00:06:06,519 --> 00:06:07,558
- Let's go.   - Let go.

53
00:06:07,641 --> 00:06:09,996
Bravo.

54
00:06:10,141 --> 00:06:11,728
Interesting. How interesting.

55
00:06:12,132 --> 00:06:13,679
The mortal realm is much more interesting

56
00:06:13,830 --> 00:06:15,455
than my last visit.

57
00:06:23,079 --> 00:06:24,666
Why can't I retrieve my soul today?

58
00:06:25,160 --> 00:06:26,316
In my opinion,

59
00:06:26,399 --> 00:06:27,865
you need to retrieve it yourself.

60
00:06:28,160 --> 00:06:29,517
After all, it's your soul.

61
00:06:29,670 --> 00:06:31,096
Maybe it only recognizes you.

62
00:06:35,442 --> 00:06:37,642
(Three days later)

63
00:06:46,160 --> 00:06:47,436
Su, Huo.

64
00:06:47,542 --> 00:06:48,888
You both look as dashing as ever.

65
00:06:49,359 --> 00:06:50,865
Qi, how have you been?

66
00:06:51,079 --> 00:06:52,367
You are robust.

67
00:06:52,475 --> 00:06:55,501
Your progress must have improved by leaps and bounds.

68
00:06:55,626 --> 00:06:56,626
Not at all.

69
00:06:56,707 --> 00:06:59,202
My progress cannot compare to yours.

70
00:07:02,720 --> 00:07:03,848
Happy birthday, Uncle Qi.

71
00:07:04,006 --> 00:07:05,553
Happy birthday, Sect Leader Qi.

72
00:07:08,760 --> 00:07:09,793
Where is your daughter?

73
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:11,033
It's my fault.

74
00:07:11,278 --> 00:07:13,480
She offended Second Young Lady Su with her mischief.

75
00:07:13,640 --> 00:07:15,476
So, as her punishment, I had her

76
00:07:15,561 --> 00:07:17,478
copy scriptures and reflect upon herself in her study.

77
00:07:17,589 --> 00:07:18,882
She deserves it.

78
00:07:22,440 --> 00:07:23,473
Big or small?

79
00:07:24,360 --> 00:07:25,360
We were gambling outside.

80
00:07:25,480 --> 00:07:27,196
And now, we're doing it inside. Will you ever stop?

81
00:07:27,279 --> 00:07:28,312
What am I supposed to do then?

82
00:07:28,440 --> 00:07:30,397
I'm bored. I'm so bored.

83
00:07:30,480 --> 00:07:31,666
I've been grounded for three days.

84
00:07:31,912 --> 00:07:34,269
I wonder who's always causing trouble?

85
00:07:34,375 --> 00:07:36,202
Now I pay the price too.

86
00:07:37,720 --> 00:07:38,753
What?

87
00:07:39,839 --> 00:07:41,117
You're my cousin.

88
00:07:41,271 --> 00:07:43,067
Aren't we supposed to stick through thick and thin?

89
00:07:43,148 --> 00:07:44,181
You're not a good friend.

90
00:07:44,681 --> 00:07:45,786
I'm not a good friend?

91
00:07:45,959 --> 00:07:48,962
If it weren't for me, you would have been beaten to a pulp.

92
00:07:53,160 --> 00:07:55,716
It seems like many cultivators are here.

93
00:07:55,970 --> 00:07:57,003
It's quite lively.

94
00:07:57,359 --> 00:07:59,837
How about we sneak out to play again?

95
00:07:59,943 --> 00:08:01,769
No. What's the point of that?

96
00:08:02,079 --> 00:08:04,996
It's just cultivators and luminaries sitting together,

97
00:08:05,079 --> 00:08:06,079
praising each other.

98
00:08:06,119 --> 00:08:07,119
It's so boring.

99
00:08:07,230 --> 00:08:08,562
I'd rather stay here.

100
00:08:10,359 --> 00:08:12,117
If your father found out about this,

101
00:08:12,231 --> 00:08:13,736
he'd wake up at night with rage.

102
00:08:16,480 --> 00:08:17,837
But aren't you curious

103
00:08:17,920 --> 00:08:19,802
about who the winner is?

104
00:08:20,040 --> 00:08:21,362
It can't be any more obvious.

105
00:08:21,600 --> 00:08:23,797
It's either the aloof Young Lady Su

106
00:08:23,918 --> 00:08:25,143
or Shu Ya.

107
00:08:26,119 --> 00:08:27,385
You trust me that much?

108
00:08:33,719 --> 00:08:35,020
- Huo.   - Shu Ya.

109
00:08:35,045 --> 00:08:35,496
Yuan Bao.

110
00:08:36,092 --> 00:08:37,774
Han Yu. Long time no see.

111
00:08:40,200 --> 00:08:42,437
I'll leave you two be.

112
00:08:42,520 --> 00:08:44,202
I'll have some tea. No, I'll get tea for you.

113
00:08:44,440 --> 00:08:45,473
Shu Ya.

114
00:08:47,239 --> 00:08:49,082
Shu Ya, when did you arrive?

115
00:08:49,239 --> 00:08:50,442
Just now.

116
00:08:50,840 --> 00:08:53,065
What were you doing just now?

117
00:08:55,320 --> 00:08:56,762
What else could we be doing?

118
00:08:57,046 --> 00:08:58,562
Just like always,

119
00:08:58,661 --> 00:09:01,442
chatting about poetry and songs.

120
00:09:01,936 --> 00:09:03,522
Poetry and songs?

121
00:09:09,496 --> 00:09:11,002
Second Young Lady Su hit you.

122
00:09:11,346 --> 00:09:12,682
I can't hide anything from you.

123
00:09:12,919 --> 00:09:14,557
Even though I'm hurt,

124
00:09:14,811 --> 00:09:16,362
she's not in much better shape either.

125
00:09:18,049 --> 00:09:19,049
Perfect.

126
00:09:19,130 --> 00:09:20,642
I brought some excellent ointment.

127
00:09:20,840 --> 00:09:22,357
It can help wounds heal quickly.

128
00:09:22,509 --> 00:09:23,498
And it won't leave any scars.

129
00:09:23,760 --> 00:09:24,793
Remember to use it.

130
00:09:24,880 --> 00:09:26,642
Shu Ya, you're the best.

131
00:09:27,359 --> 00:09:27,932
Let me do it.

132
00:09:34,880 --> 00:09:36,242
Tell me if it hurts.

133
00:09:48,080 --> 00:09:49,522
(It's almost seven days.)

134
00:09:49,799 --> 00:09:51,505
(I must retrieve my soul as soon as possible.)

135
00:09:51,679 --> 00:09:54,346
(But my soul is protecting that woman.)

136
00:09:54,559 --> 00:09:55,592
(What could be the reason?)

137
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:58,033
(Forget it.)

138
00:09:58,200 --> 00:09:59,550
(I'll try again.)

139
00:10:08,303 --> 00:10:09,642
Xue Han Yu, hurry.

140
00:10:12,760 --> 00:10:14,156
How can you be so heavy?

141
00:10:14,309 --> 00:10:15,882
- Hurry. Steady.   - Okay.

142
00:10:16,840 --> 00:10:18,837
All right. After we get out of here,

143
00:10:18,960 --> 00:10:20,117
let's go to Baihua Pavilion

144
00:10:20,202 --> 00:10:21,922
to drink with Mr. Yun Liu.

145
00:10:22,042 --> 00:10:23,439
It's been a few days. I miss him.

146
00:10:23,551 --> 00:10:25,330
- Then, we go to Zhujian Smithy.   - Zhujian Smithy?

147
00:10:25,479 --> 00:10:27,002
You want to buy your father a gift?

148
00:10:27,320 --> 00:10:28,636
Who said I was going to buy him a gift?

149
00:10:28,719 --> 00:10:29,719
I want one weapon for myself.

150
00:10:29,799 --> 00:10:31,505
Hurry up. We'll be discovered soon.

151
00:10:31,640 --> 00:10:33,113
Quick. Hurry.

152
00:10:33,640 --> 00:10:34,673
Careful!

153
00:10:35,599 --> 00:10:36,786
Yuan Bao.

154
00:10:37,840 --> 00:10:38,873
Qi Yuan Bao.

155
00:10:40,933 --> 00:10:42,562
It's indeed a small world.

156
00:11:04,269 --> 00:11:05,432
Yuan Bao.

157
00:11:07,239 --> 00:11:08,272
Yuan Bao.

158
00:11:08,595 --> 00:11:10,261
Instead of the easy path,

159
00:11:10,719 --> 00:11:12,426
you picked the difficult one.

160
00:11:20,960 --> 00:11:22,202
Qi Yuan Bao.

161
00:11:23,159 --> 00:11:24,917
Qi Yuan Bao, you shameless scoundrel!

162
00:11:25,069 --> 00:11:27,134
Come down and fight me if you dare!

163
00:11:27,310 --> 00:11:28,482
Come up here!

164
00:11:37,760 --> 00:11:38,922
Qi Yuan Bao!

165
00:11:55,280 --> 00:11:56,585
(It's all Su Qian Qian's fault)

166
00:11:56,694 --> 00:11:59,082
(for making me miss my opportunity to go out and have fun.)

167
00:12:09,960 --> 00:12:10,960
Mister.

168
00:12:11,013 --> 00:12:12,126
It's you again.

169
00:12:14,059 --> 00:12:14,928
What are you doing?

170
00:12:14,998 --> 00:12:17,305
I didn't expect you to be an impertinent person.

171
00:12:17,848 --> 00:12:20,042
Although I don't mind it,

172
00:12:20,280 --> 00:12:23,145
doing this in public might be a bit inappropriate, isn't it?

173
00:13:26,530 --> 00:13:27,559
(Beixuan Inn)

174
00:13:27,639 --> 00:13:28,917
That's your soul.

175
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:30,602
You couldn't retrieve it?

176
00:13:31,599 --> 00:13:32,786
Now that seven days have passed,

177
00:13:33,200 --> 00:13:34,233
my soul

178
00:13:34,440 --> 00:13:36,322
seems to have recognized her as its master.

179
00:13:36,647 --> 00:13:37,680
If that's the case,

180
00:13:37,840 --> 00:13:40,553
Your Highness, I'm afraid there's only one last option.

181
00:13:42,968 --> 00:13:43,968
What is it?

182
00:13:44,095 --> 00:13:45,602
If you want to get back your soul,

183
00:13:45,806 --> 00:13:48,473
the only way is for you to merge with her soul.

184
00:13:49,840 --> 00:13:51,272
How do I do that?

185
00:13:52,799 --> 00:13:54,745
Date her.

186
00:13:58,940 --> 00:14:00,642
- Ridiculous.   - Your Highness!

187
00:14:01,026 --> 00:14:03,313
Your Highness, please reconsider!

188
00:14:12,799 --> 00:14:14,042
You!

189
00:14:14,840 --> 00:14:17,306
You loaf around all day. You don't study.

190
00:14:17,599 --> 00:14:19,185
I can tolerate all that.

191
00:14:20,359 --> 00:14:22,402
But how dare you commit

192
00:14:22,679 --> 00:14:24,666
such an atrocity at today's cultivator tournament?

193
00:14:25,640 --> 00:14:28,197
Like father, like daughter.

194
00:14:28,280 --> 00:14:29,313
You...

195
00:14:33,880 --> 00:14:36,145
From now on, you're staying at Jingsi Cliff.

196
00:14:36,760 --> 00:14:38,873
Without my permission, you can't go anywhere.

197
00:14:39,452 --> 00:14:40,232
Your Highness!

198
00:14:52,498 --> 00:14:53,238
Chang Yue.

199
00:14:53,812 --> 00:14:55,278
Did you get your soul?

200
00:14:55,713 --> 00:14:56,444
My dear aunt,

201
00:14:56,799 --> 00:14:58,673
this matter is far more difficult than I imagined.

202
00:15:01,960 --> 00:15:02,993
My dear aunt,

203
00:15:03,320 --> 00:15:04,786
did something happen in Beiming?

204
00:15:05,960 --> 00:15:07,306
I didn't want to tell you this.

205
00:15:08,359 --> 00:15:09,945
But since you left,

206
00:15:10,520 --> 00:15:11,906
the barrier has become more fragile.

207
00:15:12,479 --> 00:15:14,385
The younglings are trying to repair the barrier,

208
00:15:14,840 --> 00:15:15,986
but many lost their lives.

209
00:15:17,520 --> 00:15:18,585
Your Highness.

210
00:15:18,880 --> 00:15:20,265
Just give in.

211
00:15:20,960 --> 00:15:22,956
Actually, that heiress of Qishan Sect

212
00:15:23,039 --> 00:15:24,666
isn't as bad as you think.

213
00:15:25,280 --> 00:15:27,760
Date her and make her fall in love with you.

214
00:15:27,895 --> 00:15:29,841
You'll be able to retrieve your soul.

215
00:15:30,159 --> 00:15:32,106
Your Highness.

216
00:15:33,640 --> 00:15:34,673
How do I date her?

217
00:15:38,252 --> 00:15:39,366
Stop pacing.

218
00:15:39,447 --> 00:15:41,033
You're making me dizzy.

219
00:15:48,719 --> 00:15:50,825
Yuan Bao, who exactly is that person?

220
00:15:51,840 --> 00:15:53,922
Why would he attack you

221
00:15:54,039 --> 00:15:56,716
- for no reason at all?   - Don't mention him.

222
00:15:56,861 --> 00:15:58,368
Mentioning him makes my chest hurt.

223
00:16:02,320 --> 00:16:03,353
Are you okay?

224
00:16:05,018 --> 00:16:06,442
Should I go find a physician?

225
00:16:06,706 --> 00:16:08,493
No need. I'm not that fragile.

226
00:16:08,799 --> 00:16:10,106
You must tell me if something happens.

227
00:16:18,640 --> 00:16:20,042
Let me massage your shoulder.

228
00:16:21,159 --> 00:16:22,866
Gently. I'm injured.

229
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:24,033
Okay.

230
00:16:26,652 --> 00:16:27,685
Like this?

231
00:16:28,159 --> 00:16:29,546
(What exactly is going on?)

232
00:16:30,440 --> 00:16:32,145
(Why is my severed spirit root)

233
00:16:32,520 --> 00:16:33,945
(slowly recovering?)

234
00:16:35,039 --> 00:16:36,442
(And that guy...)

235
00:16:36,760 --> 00:16:38,666
(Did I ever cross him?)

236
00:16:39,440 --> 00:16:41,745
(Why did he attack me again and again?)

237
00:16:53,401 --> 00:16:55,738
Sir, I know you're keeping Young Lady here.

238
00:16:55,840 --> 00:16:57,419
But why activate the Evil-cleansing Formation?

239
00:16:57,880 --> 00:16:59,476
It only works against demons.

240
00:16:59,629 --> 00:17:01,042
It can't keep her here.

241
00:17:03,406 --> 00:17:04,962
Perhaps Yuan Bao doesn't have

242
00:17:05,400 --> 00:17:06,837
to sneak out to cause trouble.

243
00:17:06,920 --> 00:17:09,876
Trouble will come to her sooner or later.

244
00:17:09,959 --> 00:17:11,156
You think Young Lady

245
00:17:11,301 --> 00:17:13,608
might be related to the reincarnation of the spirit particle?

246
00:17:13,800 --> 00:17:15,317
(We need to find a teacher)

247
00:17:15,454 --> 00:17:17,559
(to discipline Yuan Bao properly.)

248
00:17:22,332 --> 00:17:23,356
Grandmother.

249
00:17:23,439 --> 00:17:24,439
Seven days have passed.

250
00:17:24,575 --> 00:17:26,160
His Highness still hasn't retrieved his soul.

251
00:17:26,479 --> 00:17:27,786
What should we do?

252
00:17:29,199 --> 00:17:30,865
Chang Yue failed to retrieve his soul.

253
00:17:31,040 --> 00:17:32,465
In-tandem cultivation is the only option.

254
00:17:32,610 --> 00:17:34,682
(Notice)

255
00:17:38,599 --> 00:17:40,496
Approach your target before you capture it.

256
00:17:40,579 --> 00:17:42,692
Your Highness, look. What a coincidence.

257
00:17:42,880 --> 00:17:46,142
Qishan Sect Leader is looking for a tutor for his daughter.

258
00:17:46,239 --> 00:17:48,917
This is made for your in-tandem cultivation!

259
00:17:49,094 --> 00:17:51,120
Just this once. Never again.

260
00:17:53,439 --> 00:17:54,953
Your Highness. Wait for me!

261
00:18:07,400 --> 00:18:08,722
Move, move.

262
00:18:09,119 --> 00:18:10,962
Don't block my view.

263
00:18:15,439 --> 00:18:17,105
Poor Yuan Bao.

264
00:18:17,199 --> 00:18:18,199
You have gone insane.

265
00:18:18,279 --> 00:18:19,402
This is bad!

266
00:18:19,719 --> 00:18:21,322
This is bad! Yuan Bao!

267
00:18:21,640 --> 00:18:23,225
Yuan Bao!

268
00:18:23,479 --> 00:18:25,402
Yuan Bao, something terrible has happened!

269
00:18:25,594 --> 00:18:28,682
What could be more terrible than what I'm going through now?

270
00:18:29,839 --> 00:18:31,682
Your father has found a tutor for you!

271
00:18:32,447 --> 00:18:33,480
What?

272
00:18:33,920 --> 00:18:36,586
Immortal Tai Yi is a highly accomplished cultivator.

273
00:18:36,800 --> 00:18:38,426
He stays out of worldly affairs for many years.

274
00:18:38,800 --> 00:18:40,036
But I didn't know

275
00:18:40,126 --> 00:18:41,793
that he has a disciple.

276
00:18:41,959 --> 00:18:44,465
A young and handsome disciple, no less.

277
00:18:44,719 --> 00:18:46,385
What an occasion.

278
00:18:46,800 --> 00:18:47,448
Of course.

279
00:18:47,920 --> 00:18:48,985
I don't mean to brag,

280
00:18:49,239 --> 00:18:51,116
but Young Master is exceptionally talented.

281
00:18:51,199 --> 00:18:52,199
He has read countless books.

282
00:18:52,239 --> 00:18:54,317
Your daughter should be honored

283
00:18:54,408 --> 00:18:56,074
to be taught by him.

284
00:18:57,280 --> 00:19:00,145
Mister, I'll leave my daughter in your care.

285
00:19:03,280 --> 00:19:04,313
Mr. Chang Yue.

286
00:19:09,040 --> 00:19:10,876
Mr. Chang Yue, please follow my disciple

287
00:19:10,959 --> 00:19:13,122
to see my daughter. I'll be there shortly.

288
00:19:13,768 --> 00:19:14,768
Noted.

289
00:19:14,880 --> 00:19:15,880
Gentlemen,

290
00:19:15,982 --> 00:19:17,015
this way, please.

291
00:19:25,640 --> 00:19:29,242
I have verified his identity. He is indeed a disciple of Immortal Tai Yi.

292
00:19:29,599 --> 00:19:30,842
It's not a fake identity.

293
00:19:45,439 --> 00:19:47,116
The heiress of Qishan Sect

294
00:19:47,238 --> 00:19:48,985
lives in this desolate wilderness?

295
00:19:52,439 --> 00:19:54,553
I feel bad for her.

296
00:19:54,760 --> 00:19:57,002
She lives in this forsaken corner of the world.

297
00:19:57,239 --> 00:19:58,906
I might shed a tear of sympathy.

298
00:19:59,880 --> 00:20:01,722
Sir, why are you stopping there?

299
00:20:02,119 --> 00:20:03,152
We're almost there.

300
00:20:21,163 --> 00:20:23,282
Your Highness, we're so unlucky.

301
00:20:23,530 --> 00:20:24,807
We haven't even seen Qi Yuan Bao

302
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:26,322
and we've already been caught.

303
00:20:26,880 --> 00:20:28,516
I think we should just rush out

304
00:20:28,599 --> 00:20:30,042
and fight them.

305
00:20:31,806 --> 00:20:32,839
Okay.

306
00:20:34,760 --> 00:20:35,793
You go first.

307
00:20:38,024 --> 00:20:39,162
You must be joking.

308
00:20:39,239 --> 00:20:40,426
Let's not do this.

309
00:20:40,640 --> 00:20:42,156
Your Highness, don't forget

310
00:20:42,348 --> 00:20:43,794
what your aunt told you before you left.

311
00:20:43,959 --> 00:20:45,752
We need to be more cautious and not cause trouble.

312
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:14,362
Huasheng Sword.

313
00:21:27,280 --> 00:21:28,313
Meng Meng!

314
00:21:28,474 --> 00:21:30,442
Meng Meng!

315
00:21:30,833 --> 00:21:31,866
Meng Meng!

316
00:21:31,947 --> 00:21:35,082
Who the hell hurt you?

317
00:21:36,199 --> 00:21:37,837
Meng Meng, don't die!

318
00:21:37,949 --> 00:21:39,985
If you die, what should I do?

319
00:21:40,199 --> 00:21:41,706
Meng Meng!

320
00:21:41,920 --> 00:21:42,953
Meng Meng!

321
00:21:43,040 --> 00:21:45,145
Sir, that's Tian's spirit pet.

322
00:21:45,400 --> 00:21:46,505
It ran out on its own.

323
00:21:46,599 --> 00:21:48,282
How embarrassing.

324
00:21:48,680 --> 00:21:50,313
- Take it away now.   - Yes.

325
00:21:53,439 --> 00:21:54,876
Meng Meng.

326
00:21:54,959 --> 00:21:56,356
All right, Tian. Everyone is watching.

327
00:21:56,439 --> 00:21:57,439
- Meng Meng.   - Tian.

328
00:21:57,479 --> 00:21:58,479
Let's go.

329
00:21:58,559 --> 00:21:59,592
Let's go.

330
00:21:59,719 --> 00:22:00,752
Let's go.

331
00:22:02,920 --> 00:22:03,953
Sir,

332
00:22:04,160 --> 00:22:06,512
my apologies for the unwanted tension.

333
00:22:07,160 --> 00:22:07,738
It's all right.

334
00:22:08,920 --> 00:22:10,625
Then, sir, please.

335
00:22:22,999 --> 00:22:24,341
(This small Evil-cleansing Formation)

336
00:22:24,424 --> 00:22:25,850
(can scare me,)

337
00:22:26,045 --> 00:22:27,591
(but not His Highness.)

338
00:22:33,045 --> 00:22:35,296
The scenery of Qishan Sect is beautiful.

339
00:22:35,456 --> 00:22:38,840
I'd like to look around. Is that all right?

340
00:22:39,713 --> 00:22:41,202
Please make yourself at home.

341
00:22:45,099 --> 00:22:46,132
Yuan Bao.

342
00:22:49,898 --> 00:22:50,931
And this.

343
00:22:55,522 --> 00:22:56,868
While we still have an appetite,

344
00:22:56,949 --> 00:22:58,522
eat like there's no tomorrow!

345
00:22:58,621 --> 00:23:00,088
Eat till you die!

346
00:23:03,801 --> 00:23:04,834
Eat before the lecture.

347
00:23:06,237 --> 00:23:07,237
Father...

348
00:23:07,402 --> 00:23:08,600
Is Father truly doing this to me?

349
00:23:08,722 --> 00:23:09,868
Would I lie to you?

350
00:23:10,002 --> 00:23:11,908
You know what happened between you and that man.

351
00:23:12,561 --> 00:23:13,748
It was humiliating.

352
00:23:19,362 --> 00:23:22,122
Perhaps we should behave for a while.

353
00:23:23,153 --> 00:23:26,148
Father went to great lengths to deal with me.

354
00:23:26,723 --> 00:23:28,640
Regardless, I'm trapped in this godforsaken place

355
00:23:28,770 --> 00:23:30,196
all because of that guy.

356
00:23:30,330 --> 00:23:31,330
Don't let me see him again.

357
00:23:31,441 --> 00:23:33,282
Or else, every time I see him, I'll hit him.

358
00:23:33,416 --> 00:23:34,529
Yuan Bao, the tutor has arrived.

359
00:23:58,548 --> 00:24:00,282
Greet the tutor.

360
00:24:02,682 --> 00:24:04,479
Greetings. Thank you for your hard work.

361
00:24:04,602 --> 00:24:06,227
We seek your guidance.

362
00:24:09,161 --> 00:24:10,748
Let's test what you know first.

363
00:24:13,642 --> 00:24:14,675
Go ahead.

364
00:24:21,642 --> 00:24:23,162
He wants you to complete the proverb.

365
00:24:28,262 --> 00:24:29,295
Go ahead.

366
00:24:30,219 --> 00:24:32,444
If you don't study hard while your hair is black...

367
00:24:36,722 --> 00:24:38,922
Being my tutor will make you suffer.

368
00:24:41,201 --> 00:24:42,548
Well said!

369
00:24:43,402 --> 00:24:44,799
(Ignorant and arrogant.)

370
00:24:44,921 --> 00:24:46,762
(She's beyond help.)

371
00:24:55,362 --> 00:24:57,548
How tragic. What a tragedy.

372
00:24:58,242 --> 00:25:00,347
Someone dares to be Yuan Bao's tutor.

373
00:25:01,441 --> 00:25:02,860
I wouldn't do it for any amount of money.

374
00:25:03,622 --> 00:25:04,655
Tragic.

375
00:25:04,908 --> 00:25:06,202
Indeed, tragic.

376
00:25:06,618 --> 00:25:09,268
I wonder who is the one suffering.

377
00:25:15,921 --> 00:25:16,954
Sir,

378
00:25:18,516 --> 00:25:21,182
you don't look too happy.

379
00:25:21,745 --> 00:25:22,778
Wait.

380
00:25:24,229 --> 00:25:25,262
This...

381
00:25:26,962 --> 00:25:28,078
Pomelo will cool you down.

382
00:25:28,208 --> 00:25:29,795
Give it to the tutor.

383
00:25:40,882 --> 00:25:41,987
Kneel.

384
00:25:42,260 --> 00:25:43,602
I...

385
00:25:44,701 --> 00:25:47,337
Sir, you have a funny way of thinking.

386
00:25:47,522 --> 00:25:48,555
But I...

387
00:25:56,281 --> 00:25:57,314
You...

388
00:25:58,482 --> 00:26:00,082
What kind of spell is this?

389
00:26:00,248 --> 00:26:01,281
Serve me tea.

390
00:26:01,522 --> 00:26:02,555
Me?

391
00:26:42,041 --> 00:26:43,282
The lecture begins.

392
00:26:48,882 --> 00:26:49,987
For real?

393
00:26:50,250 --> 00:26:51,250
According to the disciples,

394
00:26:51,402 --> 00:26:53,707
Young Lady was well-behaved and sensible in class.

395
00:26:53,801 --> 00:26:56,187
She even bowed and served tea to the tutor.

396
00:26:58,921 --> 00:26:59,954
My girl

397
00:27:00,561 --> 00:27:02,148
has finally grown up.

398
00:27:05,041 --> 00:27:06,402
A ruler who wants their subjects

399
00:27:06,561 --> 00:27:08,148
to be virtuous must first

400
00:27:08,642 --> 00:27:09,908
govern with virtues.

401
00:27:10,801 --> 00:27:13,002
Yuan Bao, let's take a break.

402
00:27:13,242 --> 00:27:14,908
You've been at it for an hour.

403
00:27:15,022 --> 00:27:16,039
To have a peaceful family...

404
00:27:16,122 --> 00:27:18,307
Aren't you tired? I'm tired just by looking at it.

405
00:27:18,441 --> 00:27:20,788
It's because you guys can't undo this stasis spell.

406
00:27:21,122 --> 00:27:22,508
One must have good moral values.

407
00:27:23,828 --> 00:27:25,214
To have good moral values,

408
00:27:25,590 --> 00:27:27,322
one must be genuine.

409
00:27:28,344 --> 00:27:29,682
- To be...   - Chang Yue.

410
00:27:32,131 --> 00:27:34,479
Do not address your elders with their first name.

411
00:27:38,241 --> 00:27:39,272
Mr. Immortal?

412
00:27:42,122 --> 00:27:43,155
Hopeless.

413
00:27:44,002 --> 00:27:45,238
Master.

414
00:27:45,321 --> 00:27:46,321
Master.

415
00:27:46,401 --> 00:27:47,628
Look.

416
00:27:48,308 --> 00:27:49,842
I've been frozen for so long.

417
00:27:50,048 --> 00:27:52,400
I'm a little thirsty now.

418
00:27:52,522 --> 00:27:54,344
Can you at least let me have a sip of water?

419
00:27:54,450 --> 00:27:56,162
Yuan Bao, have some water.

420
00:27:57,547 --> 00:27:59,674
Master, look at me, I...

421
00:28:01,081 --> 00:28:02,799
I can't drink like this.

422
00:28:02,951 --> 00:28:05,176
Here, let me feed you.

423
00:28:08,502 --> 00:28:09,535
Get lost!

424
00:28:09,633 --> 00:28:11,602
Chang Yue, go to hell!

425
00:28:16,808 --> 00:28:18,282
He's a genius.

426
00:28:20,242 --> 00:28:21,987
- Forgive me.   - No worries.

427
00:28:25,522 --> 00:28:27,587
Today's lesson ends here.

428
00:28:29,402 --> 00:28:30,508
Thank you, sir.
