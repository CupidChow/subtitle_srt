1
00:01:48,765 --> 00:01:54,045
(Dear Mr. Heavenly Fox)

2
00:01:54,126 --> 00:01:57,059
(Episode 23)

3
00:02:14,532 --> 00:02:15,775
Chang Yue.

4
00:02:16,360 --> 00:02:17,962
I have something serious to tell you.

5
00:02:21,173 --> 00:02:22,362
You can be serious?

6
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:27,122
Chang Yue.

7
00:02:27,485 --> 00:02:28,508
I like you.

8
00:02:29,880 --> 00:02:30,638
I love you.

9
00:02:39,199 --> 00:02:40,199
You...

10
00:02:43,085 --> 00:02:44,408
What trick are you pulling now?

11
00:02:44,654 --> 00:02:46,402
I swear I'm serious.

12
00:02:48,679 --> 00:02:52,706
What I said at the theater on Qiqiao Festival

13
00:02:52,847 --> 00:02:54,162
was genuine.

14
00:03:06,639 --> 00:03:08,878
Stop saying those words flippantly.

15
00:03:12,600 --> 00:03:14,282
And stop teasing me like this again.

16
00:03:15,064 --> 00:03:17,682
If you don't believe me, I will say it again.

17
00:03:18,720 --> 00:03:21,640
Chang Yue. I like you. I love you.

18
00:03:21,818 --> 00:03:24,119
Every moment I spent with you at Qishan Sect

19
00:03:24,253 --> 00:03:26,442
was a joyous one.

20
00:03:27,450 --> 00:03:29,883
When you left without a word,

21
00:03:30,856 --> 00:03:32,282
I was very sad.

22
00:03:32,545 --> 00:03:34,402
I was angry with you, annoyed with you,

23
00:03:34,559 --> 00:03:37,122
but every moment in my mind, I was thinking of you.

24
00:03:37,798 --> 00:03:39,322
Later, you came back.

25
00:03:39,600 --> 00:03:40,962
I was really happy.

26
00:03:41,279 --> 00:03:42,391
I wanted...

27
00:03:42,472 --> 00:03:45,322
I wanted so badly to stay by your side all the time.

28
00:03:48,606 --> 00:03:50,168
I was afraid you wouldn't like me,

29
00:03:51,039 --> 00:03:53,682
so I tried everything to impress you,

30
00:03:54,100 --> 00:03:55,369
to make you fall in love with me.

31
00:04:00,538 --> 00:04:03,242
Actually, I had thought about it.

32
00:04:03,720 --> 00:04:06,282
Even if you are a fox and I am a human,

33
00:04:06,639 --> 00:04:08,162
I still want to be with you.

34
00:04:13,880 --> 00:04:15,522
I'm not saying this to coax you.

35
00:04:15,776 --> 00:04:17,130
If...

36
00:04:17,320 --> 00:04:18,682
If you don't believe me,

37
00:04:18,848 --> 00:04:20,522
you can believe your soul.

38
00:04:25,600 --> 00:04:26,882
Can I

39
00:04:29,440 --> 00:04:30,753
really believe you again?

40
00:04:34,920 --> 00:04:36,162
Chang Yue,

41
00:04:37,475 --> 00:04:38,842
let's give it a try.

42
00:05:11,645 --> 00:05:12,646
You lied to me again.

43
00:05:13,587 --> 00:05:14,955
You lied to me again.

44
00:05:17,025 --> 00:05:18,402
You lied to me again.

45
00:05:18,713 --> 00:05:20,442
- I didn't.   - Qi Yuan Bao.

46
00:05:21,880 --> 00:05:22,880
Just go.

47
00:05:23,440 --> 00:05:24,440
Leave Beiming.

48
00:05:24,534 --> 00:05:26,173
- Chang Yue.   - And

49
00:05:27,801 --> 00:05:29,162
don't come back anymore.

50
00:05:31,079 --> 00:05:32,242
Why?

51
00:05:32,438 --> 00:05:33,882
Why did it fail?

52
00:05:34,199 --> 00:05:35,752
There must be a problem.

53
00:05:35,967 --> 00:05:37,642
- Chang Yue, believe me.   - Go.

54
00:05:38,175 --> 00:05:39,562
- Chang Yue.   - Go away!

55
00:06:00,119 --> 00:06:02,773
Chang Yue, I must go to Suiyue Mountain now to save my father.

56
00:06:02,937 --> 00:06:05,160
After I save him, I'll come back to you.

57
00:06:05,308 --> 00:06:07,082
I will convince you.

58
00:06:07,414 --> 00:06:10,482
Miss Qi, His Highness has used a soundproof barrier.

59
00:06:10,679 --> 00:06:13,242
He can't hear what you're saying now.

60
00:06:32,388 --> 00:06:34,295
Why isn't Yuan Bao here yet?

61
00:06:35,946 --> 00:06:37,746
(Chang Yue. I like you.)

62
00:06:37,846 --> 00:06:39,025
(I love you.)

63
00:06:39,271 --> 00:06:43,814
(Every moment I spent with you at Qishan Sect was a joyous one.)

64
00:06:44,399 --> 00:06:45,842
(I had thought about it.)

65
00:06:46,040 --> 00:06:47,193
(Even if you are a fox)

66
00:06:47,279 --> 00:06:48,602
(and I am a human,)

67
00:06:48,982 --> 00:06:50,562
(I still want to be with you.)

68
00:06:54,359 --> 00:06:55,722
Is there something wrong

69
00:06:57,279 --> 00:06:58,832
with the soul?

70
00:07:12,640 --> 00:07:13,922
Chang Yue?

71
00:07:23,970 --> 00:07:25,078
Chang Yue,

72
00:07:25,372 --> 00:07:25,938
you...

73
00:07:30,573 --> 00:07:32,886
Qi Yuan Bao, I must be crazy to chase after you.

74
00:07:33,054 --> 00:07:34,654
You never take my words to heart usually,

75
00:07:34,735 --> 00:07:35,848
but when I asked you to leave,

76
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:37,319
you left so decisively.

77
00:07:37,438 --> 00:07:40,079
What makes you think you own my heart,

78
00:07:40,359 --> 00:07:42,722
that you can come and go as you please?

79
00:07:43,642 --> 00:07:45,122
You're doing this

80
00:07:45,933 --> 00:07:47,962
because you know I'm into you.

81
00:07:50,007 --> 00:07:51,322
I won't let you leave.

82
00:07:52,239 --> 00:07:53,873
Since you like lying to me so much,

83
00:07:53,985 --> 00:07:56,682
lie to me for the rest of your life.

84
00:08:20,359 --> 00:08:21,602
Chang Yue,

85
00:08:22,385 --> 00:08:24,082
I really didn't want to leave.

86
00:08:24,752 --> 00:08:27,482
I just have to do something and will be away for a few days.

87
00:08:28,128 --> 00:08:30,401
I'll come back to you.

88
00:08:31,803 --> 00:08:33,202
I don't believe you.

89
00:08:33,479 --> 00:08:34,882
You've always been a liar.

90
00:08:35,039 --> 00:08:36,322
It's true.

91
00:08:36,559 --> 00:08:39,282
I'm going to Suiyue Mountain to save my father.

92
00:08:43,926 --> 00:08:44,926
For real?

93
00:08:48,464 --> 00:08:49,722
Senior!

94
00:08:49,952 --> 00:08:51,082
If this carries on,

95
00:08:51,254 --> 00:08:52,573
I'm afraid we'll all starve to death

96
00:08:52,730 --> 00:08:53,873
before Qi Yuan Bao even arrives.

97
00:08:53,976 --> 00:08:54,976
That's right.

98
00:08:59,972 --> 00:09:00,972
Father.

99
00:09:01,053 --> 00:09:02,522
Please let them go.

100
00:09:05,640 --> 00:09:07,039
You don't have a say here.

101
00:09:07,119 --> 00:09:08,119
Sit down.

102
00:09:08,280 --> 00:09:09,280
Father,

103
00:09:09,599 --> 00:09:11,279
I followed your orders

104
00:09:11,359 --> 00:09:12,639
and spied on Qi Yuan Bao.

105
00:09:12,797 --> 00:09:14,391
I never doubted you.

106
00:09:14,880 --> 00:09:17,602
But I didn't expect you to go to extreme lengths.

107
00:09:18,159 --> 00:09:19,159
Father.

108
00:09:19,239 --> 00:09:20,682
Please stop.

109
00:09:21,080 --> 00:09:22,642
Don't go further astray.

110
00:09:35,880 --> 00:09:37,279
- Huo Shu Ya!   - Su Qing Mu.

111
00:09:37,359 --> 00:09:38,049
Let them go

112
00:09:38,462 --> 00:09:39,509
or I'll kill her.

113
00:09:40,039 --> 00:09:41,880
Huo Shu Ya, release Shen now.

114
00:09:43,599 --> 00:09:45,162
Father, I'm begging you.

115
00:09:52,760 --> 00:09:53,882
Huo Shu Ya,

116
00:09:55,200 --> 00:09:57,479
do you think I'll let all of you go

117
00:09:57,652 --> 00:09:59,406
just because you're using my daughter as a hostage?

118
00:10:01,242 --> 00:10:03,802
Do you think I would give up

119
00:10:03,941 --> 00:10:06,813
on becoming the immortal puppet king?

120
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:08,202
I will kill her for real.

121
00:10:08,327 --> 00:10:09,327
Don't!

122
00:10:14,679 --> 00:10:15,679
Do it.

123
00:10:16,200 --> 00:10:17,200
Kill her.

124
00:10:17,559 --> 00:10:19,633
See if I flinch.

125
00:10:26,440 --> 00:10:27,440
Father.

126
00:10:37,919 --> 00:10:38,919
Father.

127
00:10:40,440 --> 00:10:42,753
Do you really not care about your daughter's life?

128
00:10:44,919 --> 00:10:46,912
I'm your own daughter.

129
00:10:53,640 --> 00:10:54,640
I never imagined

130
00:10:55,640 --> 00:10:57,959
that my kind and benevolent father

131
00:10:58,039 --> 00:10:59,801
would now become a cold-blooded, ruthless demon

132
00:10:59,881 --> 00:11:02,073
with blood on his hands.

133
00:11:04,605 --> 00:11:05,480
If that's the case,

134
00:11:07,239 --> 00:11:08,513
you gave me this life.

135
00:11:11,200 --> 00:11:13,112
Then take it back.

136
00:11:14,373 --> 00:11:15,486
I'll grant you that wish!

137
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:46,112
Shen Shen!

138
00:12:00,592 --> 00:12:01,358
Shen Shen.

139
00:12:02,840 --> 00:12:04,393
Su Qing Mu has gone mad.

140
00:12:12,919 --> 00:12:13,967
Shen Shen.

141
00:12:16,280 --> 00:12:17,280
Shen Shen.

142
00:12:31,880 --> 00:12:32,880
Father.

143
00:12:41,840 --> 00:12:42,840
It's too late.

144
00:12:44,559 --> 00:12:45,223
Right here.

145
00:12:47,006 --> 00:12:48,392
So? Can you understand it now?

146
00:12:49,640 --> 00:12:50,704
With the Evil-cleansing Formation,

147
00:12:50,729 --> 00:12:52,232
we can deal with Su Qing Mu.

148
00:12:55,359 --> 00:12:56,514
What do you think, Chang Yue?

149
00:12:56,679 --> 00:12:57,712
Can you handle it?

150
00:12:58,640 --> 00:12:59,425
It's quite complicated.

151
00:13:00,880 --> 00:13:01,732
Then how about this?

152
00:13:01,960 --> 00:13:02,960
We'll just rush in

153
00:13:03,039 --> 00:13:04,273
and use the stasis spell on him.

154
00:13:05,080 --> 00:13:06,920
That won't work. Su Qing Mu's spiritual power is strong

155
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:08,761
and my depleted spiritual power hasn't recovered.

156
00:13:08,841 --> 00:13:10,032
I won't be able to freeze him.

157
00:13:10,159 --> 00:13:13,152
Then how long do you need to set up this formation? Half an hour?

158
00:13:13,919 --> 00:13:14,919
About two hours.

159
00:13:15,400 --> 00:13:16,880
- Even you need that long?   - Two hours?

160
00:13:17,280 --> 00:13:18,840
But Su Qing Mu said

161
00:13:18,920 --> 00:13:19,920
that after the deadline,

162
00:13:19,960 --> 00:13:21,193
he would start killing people.

163
00:13:23,880 --> 00:13:25,878
You know what? I'll enter the mausoleum first

164
00:13:26,039 --> 00:13:27,152
to buy some time.

165
00:13:27,599 --> 00:13:29,320
Be careful. I'll make it as quickly as I can.

166
00:13:31,320 --> 00:13:32,320
Yuan Bao, be careful.

167
00:13:35,440 --> 00:13:36,440
Mr. Chang Yue,

168
00:13:37,039 --> 00:13:38,472
is this what you meant by

169
00:13:38,640 --> 00:13:39,912
something only I can do?

170
00:14:18,640 --> 00:14:20,599
Master, time's up.

171
00:14:27,159 --> 00:14:28,159
Don't kill me.

172
00:14:28,239 --> 00:14:29,239
Don't kill me.

173
00:14:29,319 --> 00:14:30,319
Stop.

174
00:14:34,599 --> 00:14:35,599
If you want to kill someone,

175
00:14:36,239 --> 00:14:37,433
kill me first.

176
00:14:37,719 --> 00:14:39,120
Don't do this, Master.

177
00:14:39,200 --> 00:14:40,200
Don't do this.

178
00:14:40,520 --> 00:14:42,152
It's not your turn to die yet.

179
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:45,232
If your daughter doesn't appear,

180
00:14:46,119 --> 00:14:47,200
I'll make you watch

181
00:14:47,280 --> 00:14:48,633
everyone die in front of you

182
00:14:48,840 --> 00:14:51,032
one by one.

183
00:14:51,559 --> 00:14:52,559
Su Qing Mu!

184
00:14:54,479 --> 00:14:55,479
I'm here.

185
00:14:56,080 --> 00:14:57,080
Yuan Bao.

186
00:15:13,479 --> 00:15:14,479
Sect Leader Su.

187
00:15:14,760 --> 00:15:15,760
Sorry for making you wait.

188
00:15:16,640 --> 00:15:18,232
You're finally here.

189
00:15:19,640 --> 00:15:20,959
You have set up

190
00:15:21,039 --> 00:15:23,552
such an exquisite grand scheme for me.

191
00:15:23,880 --> 00:15:25,833
I have to be here.

192
00:15:45,599 --> 00:15:46,833
Then enter the formation.

193
00:15:49,280 --> 00:15:50,712
Sect Leader Su,

194
00:15:51,119 --> 00:15:52,672
you don't know me well enough.

195
00:15:53,080 --> 00:15:54,080
Have I

196
00:15:54,160 --> 00:15:55,672
ever been an obedient person?

197
00:16:01,559 --> 00:16:02,681
- Yuan Bao!   - Yuan Bao!

198
00:16:02,761 --> 00:16:04,799
- No, Yuan Bao!   - I...

199
00:16:10,400 --> 00:16:11,400
Let them go.

200
00:16:13,919 --> 00:16:14,919
Here we go again.

201
00:16:15,159 --> 00:16:16,159
Qi Yuan Bao,

202
00:16:16,280 --> 00:16:17,552
can't you come up with something new?

203
00:16:18,760 --> 00:16:20,279
Aren't you using the same trick as well?

204
00:16:20,359 --> 00:16:21,760
Threatening me with hostages.

205
00:16:21,840 --> 00:16:22,840
What new tricks do you have?

206
00:16:23,400 --> 00:16:24,400
Let them go.

207
00:16:25,280 --> 00:16:26,552
If you die,

208
00:16:27,200 --> 00:16:28,592
they'll all die here with you.

209
00:16:29,280 --> 00:16:31,112
If you listen to me and enter the formation,

210
00:16:33,159 --> 00:16:35,193
they might have a chance to live.

211
00:16:35,320 --> 00:16:36,320
You...

212
00:16:41,679 --> 00:16:42,452
I...

213
00:16:51,359 --> 00:16:52,359
Forget it.

214
00:16:52,752 --> 00:16:53,906
Even I can't be as wicked

215
00:16:54,200 --> 00:16:56,592
as you.

216
00:17:05,719 --> 00:17:07,079
Mr. Chang Yue, is it done?

217
00:17:14,520 --> 00:17:16,273
Can't you be a little gentler?

218
00:17:16,719 --> 00:17:17,719
Stop dallying.

219
00:17:19,760 --> 00:17:20,793
Let her bleed

220
00:17:21,359 --> 00:17:22,359
into the formation.

221
00:17:24,520 --> 00:17:26,832
This stupid formation requires my blood?

222
00:17:29,119 --> 00:17:31,079
- Should I do it?   - No, thanks.

223
00:17:31,280 --> 00:17:32,432
I'll do it myself.

224
00:17:45,640 --> 00:17:46,359
Hurry up.

225
00:17:47,079 --> 00:17:48,079
I know.

226
00:17:48,479 --> 00:17:50,472
Then you have to give me some time to get ready.

227
00:17:55,359 --> 00:17:56,359
Sect Leader Su, I'm going

228
00:17:56,479 --> 00:17:57,513
to cut myself now, okay?

229
00:17:58,000 --> 00:17:59,393
I'm very selfless.

230
00:17:59,560 --> 00:18:00,633
Watch carefully.

231
00:18:13,160 --> 00:18:14,200
No, it hurts so much!

232
00:18:14,280 --> 00:18:15,280
It hurts so much!

233
00:18:19,760 --> 00:18:21,680
Sect Leader Su, am I doing this right?

234
00:18:22,040 --> 00:18:24,553
Look. I've cut myself.

235
00:18:24,839 --> 00:18:26,873
Next, I'm going to drip my blood into the formation.

236
00:18:28,560 --> 00:18:29,560
Qi Yuan Bao,

237
00:18:30,479 --> 00:18:32,952
I see you prefer the rough way.

238
00:19:10,599 --> 00:19:11,599
Chang Yue!

239
00:19:12,880 --> 00:19:13,993
I can't hold it anymore!

240
00:19:36,500 --> 00:19:37,573
You're just in time.

241
00:19:45,439 --> 00:19:47,439
I had my fun. It's time to get down to business.

242
00:19:58,938 --> 00:20:00,519
- Yu.   - Uncle Qi.

243
00:20:00,599 --> 00:20:01,599
This is the antidote.

244
00:20:01,640 --> 00:20:02,640
Inhale it.

245
00:20:02,920 --> 00:20:03,920
Well done.

246
00:20:04,800 --> 00:20:06,320
Tian, give it to the other disciples.

247
00:20:06,400 --> 00:20:07,400
Okay.

248
00:20:11,680 --> 00:20:12,680
Qian Qian.

249
00:20:12,839 --> 00:20:14,359
- Xue.   - What happened to her?

250
00:20:14,439 --> 00:20:16,359
She was shocked and fainted.

251
00:20:22,800 --> 00:20:23,833
- Use it.   - Okay.

252
00:20:25,560 --> 00:20:26,560
Thank you for your help.

253
00:21:14,880 --> 00:21:15,913
Is he a monster?

254
00:21:46,160 --> 00:21:47,160
In the end,

255
00:21:47,719 --> 00:21:49,592
that villain still got away.

256
00:21:49,731 --> 00:21:51,832
What exactly is Su Qing Mu?

257
00:21:52,040 --> 00:21:53,913
Why would his appearance suddenly change like that?

258
00:21:56,199 --> 00:21:57,199
It is said that

259
00:21:57,319 --> 00:21:58,712
a hundred years ago, Emperor De

260
00:21:58,959 --> 00:21:59,993
instructed the cultivators

261
00:22:00,319 --> 00:22:01,913
to find the evil art of immortality.

262
00:22:02,560 --> 00:22:03,993
But that evil art was not complete.

263
00:22:04,719 --> 00:22:06,033
Judging from the current situation,

264
00:22:06,359 --> 00:22:07,952
he is very likely related to the evil art.

265
00:22:08,359 --> 00:22:10,273
The evil art must have backfired on him.

266
00:22:10,479 --> 00:22:11,793
His time is running out.

267
00:22:12,439 --> 00:22:13,439
No wonder he is so eager

268
00:22:13,479 --> 00:22:15,072
to obtain the power of the Corpse Puppet King.

269
00:22:15,479 --> 00:22:17,153
It seems like he won't last a few more days.

270
00:22:17,760 --> 00:22:18,760
No matter what,

271
00:22:18,839 --> 00:22:19,839
we must find him.

272
00:22:22,199 --> 00:22:23,199
Mr. Chang Yue.

273
00:22:24,359 --> 00:22:25,753
Thank you for your help.

274
00:22:26,239 --> 00:22:27,793
I was wrong to blame you last time.

275
00:22:28,839 --> 00:22:30,712
Allow me to apologize to you here.

276
00:22:32,839 --> 00:22:34,592
The past is in the past.

277
00:22:35,079 --> 00:22:36,642
Don't worry about it anymore.

278
00:23:03,560 --> 00:23:04,560
Is she okay?

279
00:23:05,280 --> 00:23:07,832
She's fine. She probably suffered from emotional shock

280
00:23:08,040 --> 00:23:09,072
and fainted.

281
00:23:11,079 --> 00:23:13,753
I didn't expect Su Qing Mu to be so cruel.

282
00:23:13,920 --> 00:23:15,422
He even killed his own daughter.

283
00:23:16,479 --> 00:23:18,952
I don't know how she'll face everyone

284
00:23:19,547 --> 00:23:21,282
when she wakes up.

285
00:23:26,239 --> 00:23:28,079
Yuan Bao. Mr. Chang Yue,

286
00:23:28,239 --> 00:23:29,920
Just go back to your work.

287
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:31,719
I can take care of things here.

288
00:23:50,040 --> 00:23:51,040
Qian Qian.

289
00:23:51,520 --> 00:23:52,520
Don't worry.

290
00:23:53,199 --> 00:23:54,633
I'll always take care of you.

291
00:23:55,959 --> 00:23:57,352
I won't leave your side.

292
00:24:08,959 --> 00:24:09,959
Does it still hurt?

293
00:24:12,880 --> 00:24:14,033
Why did you come?

294
00:24:15,800 --> 00:24:16,800
Didn't you say

295
00:24:18,439 --> 00:24:19,479
- you...   - I believe you.

296
00:24:21,560 --> 00:24:22,560
I believe you now.

297
00:24:31,119 --> 00:24:32,119
You do?

298
00:24:33,160 --> 00:24:34,840
Do you want me to say those words

299
00:24:34,920 --> 00:24:36,312
a few more times for you to hear?

300
00:24:38,040 --> 00:24:39,040
Chang Yue,

301
00:24:39,760 --> 00:24:41,753
I like you.

302
00:24:42,760 --> 00:24:45,162
Stop horsing around.

303
00:24:46,040 --> 00:24:47,892
Okay, I won't tease you anymore.

304
00:24:49,750 --> 00:24:53,343
Then do you know what's going on with the soul?

305
00:24:53,518 --> 00:24:55,265
Why can't you retrieve it?

306
00:24:56,319 --> 00:24:57,319
I don't know for now,

307
00:24:57,560 --> 00:24:59,159
but we can go back to Beiming

308
00:24:59,301 --> 00:25:01,735
and check the ancient tomes for past records.

309
00:25:02,719 --> 00:25:04,656
Then after my father settles things here,

310
00:25:04,920 --> 00:25:05,838
we'll go back to Beiming.

311
00:25:06,289 --> 00:25:08,280
We'll find a way to make it work.

312
00:25:08,360 --> 00:25:12,352
Mr. Chang Yue!

313
00:25:12,680 --> 00:25:13,680
Wait!

314
00:25:13,855 --> 00:25:15,335
What...

315
00:25:15,360 --> 00:25:16,513
What are all of you doing?

316
00:25:17,040 --> 00:25:18,414
This is the flat bread I just bought.

317
00:25:18,439 --> 00:25:19,519
It's fresh. Eat while it's hot.

318
00:25:19,599 --> 00:25:21,440
This is the tea I made for Mr. Chang Yue.

319
00:25:21,520 --> 00:25:23,720
Mr. Chang Yue, I have freshly washed fruit here. Have some.

320
00:25:23,800 --> 00:25:25,080
Here are some peanuts, Mr. Chang Yue.

321
00:25:25,160 --> 00:25:26,519
- Some peanuts.   - Mr. Chang Yue,

322
00:25:26,599 --> 00:25:27,599
have some peanuts.

323
00:25:33,352 --> 00:25:34,485
- Is it all right?   - How is it?

324
00:25:39,599 --> 00:25:40,680
Chang Yue, it's not poisonous.

325
00:25:40,819 --> 00:25:41,571
You can eat it.

326
00:25:43,079 --> 00:25:43,678
You can have it.

327
00:25:44,640 --> 00:25:46,192
Everyone, is there something you need?

328
00:25:46,479 --> 00:25:48,399
Mr. Chang Yue, we're here to apologize to you.

329
00:25:48,479 --> 00:25:50,759
- Yes.   - We have misunderstood you.

330
00:25:50,839 --> 00:25:52,600
- That's right.   - If it weren't for your help,

331
00:25:52,680 --> 00:25:54,840
we would have all died in Su Qingmu's hands.

332
00:25:54,920 --> 00:25:56,273
That's right.

333
00:25:56,479 --> 00:25:58,320
We hope you do not hold a grudge.

334
00:25:58,400 --> 00:26:00,720
Please forgive us.

335
00:26:00,800 --> 00:26:01,840
Especially you, Yuan Bao,

336
00:26:01,920 --> 00:26:03,680
have you apologized to Mr. Chang Yue yet?

337
00:26:03,760 --> 00:26:04,760
Forgive us, please.

338
00:26:04,839 --> 00:26:05,839
Forgive us.

339
00:26:09,119 --> 00:26:11,320
- It's not your fault.   - It's all Su Qingmu's fault.

340
00:26:11,400 --> 00:26:13,600
- It's all his fault.   - That's right. It's that scum's fault.

341
00:26:13,680 --> 00:26:15,080
Mr. Chang Yue, you're so generous.

342
00:26:15,160 --> 00:26:17,072
- Please forgive us.   - It's all his fault.

343
00:26:17,206 --> 00:26:18,206
No.

344
00:26:18,880 --> 00:26:19,880
- Shen Shen.   - Qian Qian.

345
00:26:21,640 --> 00:26:22,353
Qian Qian.

346
00:26:23,247 --> 00:26:23,894
No!

347
00:26:27,199 --> 00:26:28,199
You had a nightmare.

348
00:26:36,113 --> 00:26:36,585
No.

349
00:26:37,400 --> 00:26:38,880
You've been unconscious for three days.

350
00:26:39,000 --> 00:26:40,913
If you get out of bed now, your body can't handle it.

351
00:26:44,359 --> 00:26:45,393
I want to find Shen Shen.

352
00:26:45,640 --> 00:26:46,673
Qian Qian, don't go.

353
00:26:47,239 --> 00:26:49,119
- Calm down.   - Go away. Don't touch me.

354
00:26:49,199 --> 00:26:50,423
Calm down. Don't go.

355
00:26:50,503 --> 00:26:52,513
Leave me alone. Go away.

356
00:26:52,920 --> 00:26:54,513
Shen Shen is gone!

357
00:26:56,439 --> 00:26:57,439
She's gone.

358
00:27:00,920 --> 00:27:01,920
I'm sorry.

359
00:27:04,640 --> 00:27:06,122
You need to accept it.

360
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:09,000
Where's Shen Shen?

361
00:27:16,520 --> 00:27:18,033
She's buried in Suyun City.

362
00:27:30,839 --> 00:27:32,393
No!

363
00:27:55,819 --> 00:27:57,131
How could

364
00:27:59,160 --> 00:28:02,072
my father be so ruthless?

365
00:28:03,040 --> 00:28:04,025
That was Shen Shen.

366
00:28:10,839 --> 00:28:11,839
It is what it is.

367
00:28:13,959 --> 00:28:14,959
We must move on.

368
00:28:33,560 --> 00:28:34,560
Xue Han Yu,

369
00:28:37,199 --> 00:28:39,072
I never thought

370
00:28:41,199 --> 00:28:42,922
I'd lose my family

371
00:28:44,280 --> 00:28:45,652
overnight.

372
00:28:48,239 --> 00:28:49,922
Will you look down on me

373
00:28:51,153 --> 00:28:52,602
because of my father?

374
00:28:59,927 --> 00:29:01,089
