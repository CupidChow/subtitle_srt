1
00:01:48,732 --> 00:01:53,999
(Dear Mr. Heavenly Fox)

2
00:01:54,079 --> 00:01:56,992
(Episode 29)

3
00:02:09,399 --> 00:02:10,399
Father-in-law.

4
00:02:11,492 --> 00:02:12,318
Have some tea.

5
00:02:13,080 --> 00:02:14,752
Okay. Thank you.

6
00:02:31,479 --> 00:02:33,482
Grandmother Bi Xi, please have some tea.

7
00:02:46,559 --> 00:02:49,559
I hope you and Chang Yue will be together forever.

8
00:02:49,685 --> 00:02:51,048
You'll love each other without doubt

9
00:02:51,240 --> 00:02:53,272
and grow the fox clan.

10
00:02:53,600 --> 00:02:55,562
Give me a dozen grandchildren

11
00:02:55,849 --> 00:02:59,002
so that I can enjoy my retirement early.

12
00:02:59,616 --> 00:03:00,564
Okay, Grandmother Bi Xi.

13
00:03:13,759 --> 00:03:15,882
This one is made of high-quality sandalwood.

14
00:03:18,782 --> 00:03:20,942
Great choice. This one is even better.

15
00:03:25,623 --> 00:03:28,322
Xue Han Yu, have you picked one yet?

16
00:03:28,530 --> 00:03:30,002
Not yet, don't rush me.

17
00:03:30,160 --> 00:03:33,282
Hurry up. I need to buy flowers for Chang Yue.

18
00:03:34,404 --> 00:03:36,362
All you ever think about is Chang Yue.

19
00:03:37,559 --> 00:03:39,002
You're too slow.

20
00:03:41,605 --> 00:03:42,846
Isn't this one pretty good?

21
00:03:42,927 --> 00:03:44,482
Great choice, miss.

22
00:03:44,600 --> 00:03:46,752
Nowadays, girls don't like this anymore.

23
00:03:47,720 --> 00:03:50,002
Forget it, you wouldn't understand even if I told you.

24
00:03:50,160 --> 00:03:51,599
You know girls well? If you do,

25
00:03:51,717 --> 00:03:53,682
you wouldn't have made her angry when you spoke.

26
00:03:53,800 --> 00:03:55,319
Wait. There's something on your nose.

27
00:03:55,399 --> 00:03:56,369
What? You...

28
00:03:57,183 --> 00:04:00,082
Thanks to you who plagiarized my idea.

29
00:04:00,189 --> 00:04:00,794
I...

30
00:04:03,440 --> 00:04:04,640
Mister, this one, please.

31
00:04:04,743 --> 00:04:06,164
- This one is pretty good.   - Okay.

32
00:04:06,245 --> 00:04:07,878
Please engrave a word on it.

33
00:04:08,080 --> 00:04:09,522
Which word do you want?

34
00:04:10,800 --> 00:04:11,707
Qian as in Q-I-A-N.

35
00:04:12,163 --> 00:04:12,947
Okay.

36
00:04:16,058 --> 00:04:18,090
So cheesy and old-fashioned.

37
00:04:19,119 --> 00:04:20,202
Old-fashioned?

38
00:04:20,480 --> 00:04:21,492
That's right.

39
00:04:22,068 --> 00:04:24,861
If you think it's old-fashioned, then it's the best.

40
00:04:25,018 --> 00:04:25,591
I...

41
00:04:29,692 --> 00:04:31,422
Don't rush me.

42
00:04:31,561 --> 00:04:33,682
What's the rush? Wait.

43
00:04:34,200 --> 00:04:35,753
Mister, please hurry up.

44
00:04:35,880 --> 00:04:37,039
I need it urgently.

45
00:04:37,119 --> 00:04:38,402
- Okay.   - Let's go.

46
00:04:38,527 --> 00:04:40,402
Go. Just go.

47
00:04:48,040 --> 00:04:50,802
I must choose a bouquet that best complements Chang Yue.

48
00:05:04,080 --> 00:05:06,362
Yuan Bao?

49
00:05:06,839 --> 00:05:08,839
Don't waste time. Pick one quickly.

50
00:05:08,982 --> 00:05:12,042
Don't just stand there. Come over and help me choose.

51
00:05:13,086 --> 00:05:14,322
Okay.

52
00:05:14,903 --> 00:05:16,162
Which one looks better?

53
00:05:17,244 --> 00:05:19,081
It's the thought that matters.

54
00:05:19,208 --> 00:05:20,482
Buy some green foxtail.

55
00:05:20,563 --> 00:05:22,002
That one's not bad.

56
00:05:22,280 --> 00:05:23,842
You're useless. Why did I even ask?

57
00:05:25,600 --> 00:05:27,298
Do you think Chang Yue will like it?

58
00:05:27,421 --> 00:05:29,424
Like I said, men like chrysanthemums.

59
00:05:31,166 --> 00:05:32,559
Have you guys seen Chang Yue?

60
00:05:32,803 --> 00:05:33,745
- Chang Yue?   - Mr. Chang Yue?

61
00:05:34,230 --> 00:05:35,922
Forget it. I'll find him myself.

62
00:05:37,793 --> 00:05:39,081
I wonder what's going on.

63
00:05:47,440 --> 00:05:48,762
Yuan Bao.

64
00:05:49,119 --> 00:05:50,480
- Let's go.   - Father.

65
00:05:53,640 --> 00:05:54,719
You left for roasted chicken?

66
00:05:54,799 --> 00:05:55,799
Yes.

67
00:05:56,720 --> 00:05:57,873
Daughters are the best.

68
00:05:58,040 --> 00:05:59,512
They do care about their father.

69
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:01,753
Oh, Father, have you seen Chang Yue?

70
00:06:01,959 --> 00:06:04,033
- Why?   - I'm giving him roasted chicken.

71
00:06:06,440 --> 00:06:08,241
If I can't find him again, it'll get cold.

72
00:06:08,321 --> 00:06:09,593
It won't be as delicious.

73
00:06:11,519 --> 00:06:13,792
I don't know where he is. Ask your seniors.

74
00:06:14,399 --> 00:06:15,400
Okay then.

75
00:06:15,480 --> 00:06:16,480
I'll go find him now.

76
00:06:22,279 --> 00:06:24,159
Liu, have you seen Chang Yue?

77
00:06:24,239 --> 00:06:26,080
I saw him go to the kitchen.

78
00:06:26,160 --> 00:06:27,160
Thanks.

79
00:06:28,153 --> 00:06:29,486
- Qi Liu.   - Master.

80
00:06:31,239 --> 00:06:33,560
- Master.   - What's Chang Yue doing in the kitchen?

81
00:06:33,640 --> 00:06:35,319
Chang Yue is making her favorite

82
00:06:35,399 --> 00:06:36,399
fennel dumplings.

83
00:06:36,519 --> 00:06:37,519
What?

84
00:06:39,799 --> 00:06:40,799
That brat

85
00:06:41,239 --> 00:06:43,672
is stealing my and Yuan Bao's dumpling memories.

86
00:06:44,239 --> 00:06:45,473
Outrageous!

87
00:06:53,480 --> 00:06:55,193
(How fortunate am I)

88
00:06:55,399 --> 00:06:58,512
(to have such a virtuous and handsome husband?)

89
00:07:09,359 --> 00:07:10,359
Darling.

90
00:07:10,399 --> 00:07:11,399
Here.

91
00:07:24,440 --> 00:07:25,759
No, this is impossible.

92
00:07:25,839 --> 00:07:26,839
Impossible.

93
00:07:27,720 --> 00:07:28,720
Wait.

94
00:07:29,040 --> 00:07:30,759
Calm down. Tell me what's wrong.

95
00:07:30,839 --> 00:07:32,320
Listen. Never get married.

96
00:07:32,400 --> 00:07:34,840
You'll regret it as soon as you get married. I'm a living example.

97
00:07:34,920 --> 00:07:37,241
Look at me. I was carefree and unrestrained.

98
00:07:37,321 --> 00:07:38,952
Now, look how miserable I am.

99
00:07:39,239 --> 00:07:41,160
I brought this upon myself.

100
00:07:41,880 --> 00:07:42,952
But I'll accept this misery,

101
00:07:43,040 --> 00:07:44,873
as all I ever wanted was money and beauty.

102
00:07:46,200 --> 00:07:47,640
But you don't have this trouble.

103
00:07:47,720 --> 00:07:49,199
Because Xue Han Yu is ugly.

104
00:07:49,279 --> 00:07:50,680
He's an ugly duckling. You don't have to

105
00:07:50,760 --> 00:07:51,760
worry about these things.

106
00:07:52,440 --> 00:07:54,000
More importantly, look at me.

107
00:07:54,080 --> 00:07:55,560
Look how fat I've gotten!

108
00:07:55,640 --> 00:07:58,400
When I put on a robe, my waist bulges out. See?

109
00:07:58,480 --> 00:07:59,681
Do you know? Chang Yue feeds me

110
00:07:59,761 --> 00:08:01,319
so much good food every night,

111
00:08:01,399 --> 00:08:03,080
and he gets angry if I don't eat it.

112
00:08:03,160 --> 00:08:04,753
I can't soothe him at all.

113
00:08:04,959 --> 00:08:06,519
How strange. Are all men the same?

114
00:08:06,799 --> 00:08:08,520
You're definitely going to say this is happiness.

115
00:08:08,600 --> 00:08:10,552
Let me tell you. There's no such thing as happiness.

116
00:08:10,720 --> 00:08:12,512
Only fattiness.

117
00:08:13,359 --> 00:08:15,489
Look at you. You're so skinny, you're practically bones.

118
00:08:15,640 --> 00:08:16,640
So skinny!

119
00:08:16,679 --> 00:08:17,920
Look at how fat I've become.

120
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:19,000
- I...   - Qi Yuan Bao.

121
00:08:20,971 --> 00:08:21,971
Are you done showing off?

122
00:08:23,239 --> 00:08:24,326
- Get lost!   - I...

123
00:08:26,920 --> 00:08:28,080
Fine. You're so fierce.

124
00:08:28,160 --> 00:08:30,000
No wonder you can't get married. No one wants you.

125
00:08:31,359 --> 00:08:32,359
Me?

126
00:08:32,719 --> 00:08:35,032
Wait a minute. This is my chamber.

127
00:08:35,440 --> 00:08:36,440
You get lost.

128
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:41,000
I hope you get so fat you die!

129
00:08:42,919 --> 00:08:44,873
So mean. No wonder no one wants you.

130
00:08:49,559 --> 00:08:51,360
- Xue, leave it to us.   - Okay.

131
00:08:51,440 --> 00:08:52,639
When are you getting that ball?

132
00:08:52,719 --> 00:08:53,719
It's coming right up.

133
00:08:54,280 --> 00:08:55,712
Good luck, Xue.

134
00:08:55,960 --> 00:08:56,960
Thank you.

135
00:08:57,719 --> 00:08:59,719
Tian, that flower seems crooked.

136
00:08:59,799 --> 00:09:00,953
Can you help me straighten it?

137
00:09:01,119 --> 00:09:03,039
- Sure, no problem.   - Thank you, Tian.

138
00:09:04,039 --> 00:09:04,752
Liu,

139
00:09:05,159 --> 00:09:06,159
can you move that flower

140
00:09:06,320 --> 00:09:07,800
a little to the left?

141
00:09:07,880 --> 00:09:09,760
Don't worry, this is a once-in-a-lifetime event.

142
00:09:09,840 --> 00:09:10,873
Leave it to me.

143
00:09:11,039 --> 00:09:12,039
Thanks, Liu.

144
00:09:14,919 --> 00:09:17,193
Right, I haven't told Qian Qian yet.

145
00:09:18,919 --> 00:09:19,919
Hold on tight.

146
00:09:20,159 --> 00:09:21,159
Okay.

147
00:09:22,200 --> 00:09:23,393
My seniors,

148
00:09:23,960 --> 00:09:24,960
thank you for your hard work.

149
00:09:25,359 --> 00:09:26,359
You're welcome.

150
00:09:26,635 --> 00:09:28,159
- All the best.   - All the best.

151
00:09:28,239 --> 00:09:29,239
Thank you.

152
00:09:30,719 --> 00:09:32,352
Xue Han Yu is such an idiot.

153
00:09:32,512 --> 00:09:33,512
Stupid fool.

154
00:09:33,880 --> 00:09:35,054
I wonder what he's doing lately.

155
00:09:41,359 --> 00:09:42,359
Qian Qian.

156
00:09:44,919 --> 00:09:45,919
What?

157
00:09:54,400 --> 00:09:55,400
What's this?

158
00:09:59,359 --> 00:10:01,159
Be there or be square.

159
00:10:09,472 --> 00:10:12,352
(Meet me at Yanhui Corridor at the hour of Hai. Be there or be square!)

160
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:05,880
I think this decoration is pretty good.

161
00:11:05,960 --> 00:11:08,112
I think you're wrong. How can you decorate it like this?

162
00:11:08,359 --> 00:11:09,359
He's out.

163
00:11:20,512 --> 00:11:21,232
How do I look?

164
00:11:22,039 --> 00:11:24,039
- Am I handsome?   - Super handsome!

165
00:11:24,559 --> 00:11:25,559
Right?

166
00:11:25,919 --> 00:11:26,919
I am super handsome!

167
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:29,120
- Very handsome!   - I think so too.

168
00:11:29,200 --> 00:11:31,212
Right? So handsome!

169
00:11:33,359 --> 00:11:35,352
Han Yu, make sure to be nice

170
00:11:35,679 --> 00:11:37,399
when you meet her later.

171
00:11:37,479 --> 00:11:38,993
Don't make her angry again.

172
00:11:39,320 --> 00:11:41,000
- The gift?   - It's here.

173
00:11:41,080 --> 00:11:41,742
A proposal gift

174
00:11:42,239 --> 00:11:44,393
must be given to her very sincerely.

175
00:11:45,479 --> 00:11:47,592
Get on one knee.

176
00:11:48,039 --> 00:11:49,112
Right.

177
00:11:51,165 --> 00:11:51,688
Qian Qian.

178
00:11:52,559 --> 00:11:53,559
Here I come!

179
00:11:54,960 --> 00:11:57,592
- Here I come!   - Bring your wife back!

180
00:11:58,119 --> 00:11:58,974
Don't worry.

181
00:11:59,280 --> 00:12:00,393
Wait for my good news!

182
00:12:00,719 --> 00:12:05,552
Xue Han Yu!

183
00:12:21,200 --> 00:12:22,200
Xue Han Yu.

184
00:12:23,599 --> 00:12:24,599
Xue Han Yu.

185
00:12:26,960 --> 00:12:27,960
Xue Han Yu.

186
00:12:30,719 --> 00:12:31,719
Xue Han Yu!

187
00:12:35,679 --> 00:12:36,953
That idiot.

188
00:12:37,159 --> 00:12:38,159
Did he oversleep?

189
00:12:40,419 --> 00:12:41,419
I'm not waiting anymore.

190
00:12:46,919 --> 00:12:47,919
Fine.

191
00:12:48,119 --> 00:12:49,993
I'll wait for you for a while.

192
00:13:14,640 --> 00:13:16,633
I wonder where Yuan Bao and Chang Yue will live after this.

193
00:13:16,919 --> 00:13:18,753
Master will let them stay in Qishan Sect.

194
00:13:19,845 --> 00:13:21,279
Yuan Bao, it's so late.

195
00:13:21,359 --> 00:13:22,359
Why aren't you in bed yet?

196
00:13:47,880 --> 00:13:48,912
Yuan Bao.

197
00:13:49,320 --> 00:13:50,993
It's me, Han Yu.

198
00:13:51,320 --> 00:13:54,032
Open your eyes and look at me.

199
00:13:54,200 --> 00:13:55,200
Look at me.

200
00:13:56,559 --> 00:13:57,753
Yuan Bao.

201
00:13:59,400 --> 00:14:00,993
I'm Han Yu.

202
00:14:01,365 --> 00:14:02,838
Yuan Bao!

203
00:14:08,445 --> 00:14:09,445
Han Yu.

204
00:14:15,500 --> 00:14:16,500
No!

205
00:14:38,686 --> 00:14:39,558
Yuan Bao!

206
00:15:11,520 --> 00:15:12,912
I'm sorry.

207
00:16:05,458 --> 00:16:06,225
Xue Han Yu?

208
00:16:10,679 --> 00:16:11,679
What a cliche.

209
00:16:18,039 --> 00:16:19,039
What a cliche.

210
00:16:42,640 --> 00:16:44,193
Qian Qian...

211
00:17:00,428 --> 00:17:01,833
Qian Qian...

212
00:17:42,479 --> 00:17:43,479
Yuan Bao!

213
00:19:34,880 --> 00:19:35,880
Father.

214
00:19:40,920 --> 00:19:41,920
Father!

215
00:19:42,585 --> 00:19:44,192
Father!

216
00:19:45,604 --> 00:19:46,604
Father!

217
00:20:15,880 --> 00:20:17,400
- Yuan Bao.   - Don't come near me.

218
00:20:23,800 --> 00:20:24,800
Why?

219
00:20:25,760 --> 00:20:26,760
Why?

220
00:20:27,160 --> 00:20:28,160
Chang Yue,

221
00:20:29,760 --> 00:20:31,072
give me a reason.

222
00:20:32,319 --> 00:20:33,712
Tell me.

223
00:20:34,479 --> 00:20:35,832
I'm willing to believe anything.

224
00:20:36,839 --> 00:20:38,232
Anything.

225
00:20:48,640 --> 00:20:50,072
Why aren't you talking?

226
00:20:51,400 --> 00:20:52,712
Talk to me.

227
00:20:53,719 --> 00:20:55,472
Why aren't you talking?

228
00:20:56,239 --> 00:20:57,641
Talk to me!

229
00:20:58,880 --> 00:21:00,153
Give me a reason.

230
00:21:00,520 --> 00:21:01,879
Even if it's a lie.

231
00:21:01,959 --> 00:21:04,239
Even if you just make up a lie, I'll believe it.

232
00:21:04,319 --> 00:21:06,553
Just talk to me.

233
00:21:09,199 --> 00:21:10,085
Yuan Bao.

234
00:21:14,920 --> 00:21:15,920
There is no reason.

235
00:21:24,280 --> 00:21:25,280
Chang Yue.

236
00:21:29,719 --> 00:21:30,719
Chang Yue.

237
00:21:31,839 --> 00:21:33,513
I'll ask you one last time.

238
00:21:34,479 --> 00:21:36,072
Didn't you once resent me

239
00:21:36,800 --> 00:21:38,993
for not asking for the truth from you?

240
00:21:40,880 --> 00:21:42,673
I'm asking for the truth now.

241
00:21:44,721 --> 00:21:45,520
Why did you

242
00:21:47,119 --> 00:21:49,192
kill my father?

243
00:22:12,439 --> 00:22:13,439
There is no reason.

244
00:22:18,439 --> 00:22:19,439
Xue Han Yu

245
00:22:21,479 --> 00:22:23,072
and the other disciples...

246
00:22:24,040 --> 00:22:25,312
did you kill them too?

247
00:22:28,599 --> 00:22:30,033
Is that right?

248
00:22:42,239 --> 00:22:43,239
Yes.

249
00:22:50,959 --> 00:22:51,959
Why?

250
00:22:54,199 --> 00:22:55,633
Why?

251
00:22:56,719 --> 00:22:58,993
Why did you do this?

252
00:23:02,575 --> 00:23:04,094
Why did you kill my father?

253
00:23:04,119 --> 00:23:05,432
Why?

254
00:23:06,599 --> 00:23:08,873
I'm going to kill you, Chang Yue.

255
00:23:09,086 --> 00:23:11,285
I hate you!

256
00:23:11,439 --> 00:23:13,712
Chang Yue, I'm going to kill you.

257
00:23:13,839 --> 00:23:16,072
Give me back my father!

258
00:23:20,880 --> 00:23:22,913
Give me back my father!

259
00:23:23,119 --> 00:23:24,993
Give him back to me!

260
00:23:25,160 --> 00:23:27,153
Why?

261
00:23:27,621 --> 00:23:29,405
Why?

262
00:23:29,485 --> 00:23:30,919
Chang Yue!

263
00:23:49,760 --> 00:23:50,832
Master!

264
00:24:01,920 --> 00:24:03,072
Master!

265
00:24:17,202 --> 00:24:20,572
(In Loving Memory of Xue Han Yu, In Loving Memory of Qi Lian)

266
00:24:22,400 --> 00:24:24,393
Yuan Bao, wait for me.

267
00:24:24,880 --> 00:24:26,592
Wait for me, Yuan Bao.

268
00:24:27,192 --> 00:24:29,226
Yuan Bao, wait for me!

269
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:31,000
Come on, Xue Han Yu,

270
00:24:31,040 --> 00:24:32,232
Let's play on the swing.

271
00:24:32,399 --> 00:24:33,004
Okay.

272
00:24:35,359 --> 00:24:36,359
You're so heavy.

273
00:24:36,479 --> 00:24:37,479
Sit tight.

274
00:24:44,119 --> 00:24:45,312
Yuan Bao, stop!

275
00:24:45,640 --> 00:24:46,793
Put me down!

276
00:24:47,335 --> 00:24:48,694
- I don't want it.   - Isn't this fun?

277
00:24:48,719 --> 00:24:50,192
Stop it, Yuan Bao.

278
00:24:50,334 --> 00:24:51,334
Put me down.

279
00:24:51,359 --> 00:24:53,480
I don't want to play anymore. Put me down.

280
00:24:53,560 --> 00:24:55,146
- Yuan Bao.   - Stop!

281
00:24:56,640 --> 00:24:58,080
Come. Yu, are you okay?

282
00:24:58,160 --> 00:24:59,192
I'm fine.

283
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:02,312
You always bully Yu.

284
00:25:03,473 --> 00:25:04,113
I...

285
00:25:05,640 --> 00:25:06,640
Yuan Bao.

286
00:25:07,359 --> 00:25:09,138
Stop chasing me.

287
00:25:12,119 --> 00:25:13,119
Father!

288
00:25:27,959 --> 00:25:29,112
Master!

289
00:25:58,680 --> 00:25:59,680
Miss Su,

290
00:26:02,719 --> 00:26:05,279
this is the robe Xue had ordered

291
00:26:05,359 --> 00:26:06,673
for you.

292
00:26:08,719 --> 00:26:09,832
It just arrived today.

293
00:27:11,358 --> 00:27:12,359
Xue Han Yu,

294
00:27:15,079 --> 00:27:16,079
you lied to me again.

295
00:27:53,199 --> 00:27:54,199
I told you

296
00:27:57,119 --> 00:27:58,192
that I would

297
00:28:00,920 --> 00:28:02,112
marry the person

298
00:28:05,280 --> 00:28:06,673
I love in a glorious way.

299
00:28:08,959 --> 00:28:09,959
Just wait.

300
00:28:10,040 --> 00:28:12,039
One day, I will put on this wedding robe

301
00:28:12,119 --> 00:28:13,432
and marry the person I love the most.

302
00:28:45,319 --> 00:28:46,319
I can't cry,

303
00:28:51,880 --> 00:28:52,880
I can't cry.

304
00:29:07,760 --> 00:29:08,760
Xue Han Yu.

305
00:29:10,239 --> 00:29:11,239
Here I come.
