1
00:01:48,882 --> 00:01:53,987
(Dear Mr. Heavenly Fox)

2
00:01:54,068 --> 00:01:57,008
(Episode 13)

3
00:02:13,399 --> 00:02:14,492
Yuan Bao.

4
00:02:14,600 --> 00:02:17,073
I love this robe.

5
00:02:24,639 --> 00:02:26,242
I'm glad you like it.

6
00:02:28,279 --> 00:02:29,279
Look.

7
00:02:30,153 --> 00:02:32,472
I heard that they are getting engaged.

8
00:02:32,639 --> 00:02:34,282
It turns out it's true.

9
00:02:35,479 --> 00:02:37,839
Of course. Their families are good friends.

10
00:02:38,014 --> 00:02:40,759
And now, Mr. Huo risked his life to save Young Lady Qi.

11
00:02:40,925 --> 00:02:44,079
We will soon have a wedding banquet.

12
00:02:44,220 --> 00:02:45,220
Exactly.

13
00:02:45,301 --> 00:02:47,221
They are a match made in heaven.

14
00:02:47,381 --> 00:02:48,574
They look good together.

15
00:02:49,073 --> 00:02:51,842
Yes. We will soon have a wedding banquet.

16
00:02:52,249 --> 00:02:53,733
Yes.

17
00:02:54,436 --> 00:02:55,602
They look good together.

18
00:02:55,683 --> 00:02:57,282
- I agree.   - What a matching pair.

19
00:03:07,559 --> 00:03:09,962
Sect Leader Qi, I am feeling unwell.

20
00:03:10,189 --> 00:03:11,642
I'll take my leave.

21
00:03:16,039 --> 00:03:17,039
All right.

22
00:03:21,440 --> 00:03:22,440
Master.

23
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:24,000
Master.

24
00:03:24,279 --> 00:03:25,842
- Master.   - Mr. Chang Yue.

25
00:03:27,960 --> 00:03:29,080
What nonsense is this?

26
00:03:29,160 --> 00:03:31,240
Who said I was marrying Shu Ya?

27
00:03:32,232 --> 00:03:33,101
Master.

28
00:03:33,880 --> 00:03:34,880
- Master.   - Yuan...

29
00:03:37,199 --> 00:03:37,820
Master.

30
00:03:43,759 --> 00:03:44,515
Master.

31
00:03:45,631 --> 00:03:46,254
Chang Yue.

32
00:03:51,559 --> 00:03:53,593
Are you going back to the inn?

33
00:03:55,080 --> 00:03:56,762
What's wrong?

34
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:58,162
You didn't seem

35
00:03:58,360 --> 00:04:00,802
very happy in there just now.

36
00:04:01,160 --> 00:04:02,440
Was it the food tonight?

37
00:04:02,605 --> 00:04:04,167
Did you not enjoy it?

38
00:04:04,520 --> 00:04:06,202
Actually, I...

39
00:04:06,559 --> 00:04:07,559
That night...

40
00:04:10,440 --> 00:04:11,882
Why did you kiss me?

41
00:04:15,800 --> 00:04:16,800
(Oh, no.)

42
00:04:16,880 --> 00:04:18,552
(He's here to hold me accountable.)

43
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:20,840
(I knew it. He's still mad)

44
00:04:20,920 --> 00:04:22,232
(about my misbehavior that night.)

45
00:04:27,920 --> 00:04:29,153
Is it that hard to answer?

46
00:04:30,200 --> 00:04:32,193
No, it's not that hard to answer.

47
00:04:33,559 --> 00:04:34,802
That day...

48
00:04:37,679 --> 00:04:40,392
That day, I was delirious from my illness.

49
00:04:40,735 --> 00:04:44,153
That's why I did such ridiculous and untoward things.

50
00:04:45,640 --> 00:04:47,033
Ridiculous and untoward?

51
00:04:47,720 --> 00:04:49,400
Master, I'm sorry.

52
00:04:49,480 --> 00:04:51,279
I made a huge mistake.

53
00:04:51,720 --> 00:04:53,473
Can you just forgive me?

54
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:55,000
Also,

55
00:04:55,040 --> 00:04:56,313
didn't you...

56
00:04:57,839 --> 00:05:00,072
Didn't you kiss me back as well?

57
00:05:00,320 --> 00:05:01,552
So we're even.

58
00:05:01,720 --> 00:05:03,039
Just forget all about it.

59
00:05:03,119 --> 00:05:04,952
Just pretend like none of it ever happened,

60
00:05:05,079 --> 00:05:06,079
okay?

61
00:05:07,200 --> 00:05:09,002
So, you treat something

62
00:05:09,720 --> 00:05:11,762
like that as a trivial matter.

63
00:05:11,961 --> 00:05:14,002
Pretend like nothing ever happened?

64
00:05:14,945 --> 00:05:16,617
Then what do you want me to do?

65
00:05:16,839 --> 00:05:18,000
Perhaps

66
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:21,882
I'll take responsibility?

67
00:05:22,040 --> 00:05:23,402
Take responsibility?

68
00:05:25,920 --> 00:05:26,952
How?

69
00:05:27,880 --> 00:05:28,880
I...

70
00:05:30,839 --> 00:05:31,839
I...

71
00:05:33,279 --> 00:05:34,279
I...

72
00:05:36,320 --> 00:05:37,320
We'll get married.

73
00:05:46,640 --> 00:05:47,792
You treat everything like a game.

74
00:05:48,480 --> 00:05:49,593
You're insensitive.

75
00:05:50,720 --> 00:05:52,039
You even promised your marriage away

76
00:05:52,119 --> 00:05:53,713
so flippantly.

77
00:05:54,480 --> 00:05:55,480
I...

78
00:05:58,239 --> 00:05:59,239
Master.

79
00:06:02,519 --> 00:06:03,952
Then what do you want me to do?

80
00:06:05,279 --> 00:06:06,593
Apologizing doesn't work.

81
00:06:07,279 --> 00:06:08,552
Marrying you doesn't work either.

82
00:06:18,399 --> 00:06:19,399
(That day...)

83
00:06:19,480 --> 00:06:21,153
(That day, I was delirious from my illness.)

84
00:06:21,519 --> 00:06:23,080
(That's why I did such ridiculous)

85
00:06:23,160 --> 00:06:24,593
(and untoward things.)

86
00:06:25,320 --> 00:06:27,552
(Didn't you kiss me back as well?)

87
00:06:27,839 --> 00:06:29,072
(We're even now.)

88
00:06:29,519 --> 00:06:30,640
(Just forget all about it.)

89
00:06:30,720 --> 00:06:32,753
(Just pretend like none of it ever happened,)

90
00:06:32,920 --> 00:06:33,920
(okay?)

91
00:06:34,880 --> 00:06:36,672
(Perhaps I'll take responsibility?)

92
00:06:38,200 --> 00:06:39,313
(How?)

93
00:06:40,279 --> 00:06:41,279
(I...)

94
00:06:42,399 --> 00:06:43,399
(We'll get married.)

95
00:06:58,559 --> 00:06:59,238
Yuan Bao.

96
00:07:02,200 --> 00:07:03,200
Yuan Bao, you're back!

97
00:07:05,839 --> 00:07:06,839
Where's Mr. Chang Yue?

98
00:07:07,079 --> 00:07:08,079
He left.

99
00:07:10,880 --> 00:07:12,633
He left so suddenly.

100
00:07:12,880 --> 00:07:14,033
It's so festive today.

101
00:07:14,832 --> 00:07:15,832
Why didn't he stay?

102
00:07:17,720 --> 00:07:19,993
You can never read a man's mind.

103
00:07:20,720 --> 00:07:22,512
He's unfathomable.

104
00:07:27,640 --> 00:07:28,879
Don't drink that much.

105
00:07:28,959 --> 00:07:31,352
- You just recovered. You can't drink.   - Let me be.

106
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:33,279
Fine, I'll drink with you.

107
00:07:33,359 --> 00:07:34,359
Stop it.

108
00:07:35,119 --> 00:07:36,439
Yuan Bao can be immature,

109
00:07:36,519 --> 00:07:37,713
but why are you joining in?

110
00:07:37,839 --> 00:07:38,840
This is between us girls.

111
00:07:38,920 --> 00:07:39,920
Stay out of it!

112
00:07:40,160 --> 00:07:41,160
That's right!

113
00:07:41,720 --> 00:07:43,640
- Let's drink together!   - We'll drink with you!

114
00:07:43,720 --> 00:07:44,720
Come.

115
00:07:44,839 --> 00:07:45,879
- Bottoms up.   - Bottoms up.

116
00:07:45,959 --> 00:07:47,839
- Cheers.   - Cheers.

117
00:07:51,279 --> 00:07:52,360
This way! Hurry!

118
00:07:52,440 --> 00:07:54,560
Another kidnapper broke into Yuan Bao's chamber to kidnap her!

119
00:07:54,640 --> 00:07:55,893
- Help her.   - Quick.

120
00:07:56,880 --> 00:07:57,880
Keep up.

121
00:07:58,320 --> 00:07:59,320
Keep up.

122
00:08:28,079 --> 00:08:29,633
You can't run today!

123
00:08:38,320 --> 00:08:39,320
After it!

124
00:08:43,440 --> 00:08:45,839
- Bottoms up.   - I wish you a long and happy life

125
00:08:45,919 --> 00:08:46,919
and good health!

126
00:08:47,039 --> 00:08:48,073
Come, let's chug this one.

127
00:08:48,440 --> 00:08:49,840
- Yes.   - Thank you.

128
00:08:50,465 --> 00:08:51,839
- Quick.   - Fill the cup.

129
00:08:51,919 --> 00:08:52,919
Fill it up.

130
00:08:54,359 --> 00:08:56,393
Come. This is from me.

131
00:08:59,173 --> 00:09:00,173
Thanks.

132
00:09:02,045 --> 00:09:02,898
Fill it up.

133
00:09:04,452 --> 00:09:06,392
- Don't forget about me, Yuan Bao.   - Here,

134
00:09:07,015 --> 00:09:08,415
I wish you as much happiness

135
00:09:08,440 --> 00:09:09,513
as you have today.

136
00:09:10,479 --> 00:09:12,000
- Come.   - Thank you.

137
00:09:12,025 --> 00:09:13,284
- Cheers!   - Here!

138
00:09:13,659 --> 00:09:14,772
Let's all have a drink together.

139
00:09:14,880 --> 00:09:16,719
- Come.   - Cheers.

140
00:09:16,799 --> 00:09:19,472
All right, are you guys trying to get me wasted?

141
00:09:20,654 --> 00:09:21,694
We're just having a drink.

142
00:09:21,719 --> 00:09:23,352
Exactly. It's a joyful occasion.

143
00:09:23,559 --> 00:09:24,827
- Let's have another drink.   - Carry on.

144
00:09:25,119 --> 00:09:26,119
Come on.

145
00:09:28,359 --> 00:09:29,359
Something's not right.

146
00:09:30,320 --> 00:09:32,472
Usually, when I have a drink,

147
00:09:32,919 --> 00:09:35,159
all of you worry more than my father.

148
00:09:35,239 --> 00:09:36,592
Why are you acting so strange today?

149
00:09:38,119 --> 00:09:39,119
Yuan Bao.

150
00:09:40,440 --> 00:09:43,592
Something strange is going on.

151
00:09:43,840 --> 00:09:44,840
Speak. What exactly are

152
00:09:44,920 --> 00:09:45,953
you up to?

153
00:09:46,400 --> 00:09:48,152
- This cup...   - We aren't doing anything.

154
00:09:49,200 --> 00:09:50,200
Speak!

155
00:09:50,280 --> 00:09:51,672
Are you going to talk or not?

156
00:09:51,960 --> 00:09:53,321
If you won't tell me, forget

157
00:09:53,401 --> 00:09:54,633
about our friendship.

158
00:09:59,719 --> 00:10:01,993
A fox demon has broken into our sect.

159
00:10:02,599 --> 00:10:04,753
Master is hunting a fox.

160
00:10:04,919 --> 00:10:05,919
Hunting a fox?

161
00:10:20,799 --> 00:10:21,799
Fox demon.

162
00:10:21,919 --> 00:10:23,032
You're badly injured.

163
00:10:23,280 --> 00:10:25,313
Just surrender and I'll spare your life.

164
00:10:25,400 --> 00:10:27,433
Mr. Qi, you mustn't let it get away!

165
00:10:48,840 --> 00:10:49,840
Yuan Bao!

166
00:10:51,719 --> 00:10:52,719
Yuan Bao!

167
00:10:52,960 --> 00:10:54,313
Little fox, are you all right?

168
00:10:54,559 --> 00:10:55,760
(You're not all right.)

169
00:10:55,840 --> 00:10:56,840
Yuan Bao.

170
00:10:58,000 --> 00:10:59,679
Why would you sacrifice yourself to save a fox?

171
00:11:02,320 --> 00:11:04,039
Yuan Bao! Come down here now!

172
00:11:04,119 --> 00:11:05,240
Let me check on your injuries.

173
00:11:05,320 --> 00:11:06,320
Yuan Bao!

174
00:11:06,359 --> 00:11:07,519
Hand over the fox!

175
00:11:07,599 --> 00:11:09,193
Treating your injuries is more important!

176
00:11:16,840 --> 00:11:17,840
Yuan Bao!

177
00:11:19,359 --> 00:11:20,454
- Yuan Bao!   - Master,

178
00:11:20,479 --> 00:11:21,479
what do we do now?

179
00:11:22,159 --> 00:11:23,959
Mr. Qi, Yuan Bao can't be alone with it.

180
00:11:24,039 --> 00:11:25,240
She's seriously injured.

181
00:11:25,320 --> 00:11:26,399
If it wants to hurt Yuan Bao,

182
00:11:26,479 --> 00:11:27,993
she's no match for him.

183
00:11:28,479 --> 00:11:29,664
- Give chase.   - Noted.

184
00:11:39,440 --> 00:11:41,360
Before they get here, you should go.

185
00:11:41,440 --> 00:11:42,440
(Your injuries...)

186
00:11:44,479 --> 00:11:45,479
You're worried about me?

187
00:11:47,080 --> 00:11:48,760
Don't worry. These little scratches

188
00:11:48,840 --> 00:11:49,840
are nothing.

189
00:11:50,320 --> 00:11:51,760
Your injuries are serious.

190
00:11:51,840 --> 00:11:52,840
If you don't go now,

191
00:11:53,039 --> 00:11:54,479
my father will catch you.

192
00:11:54,559 --> 00:11:56,152
He hates foxes more than anything.

193
00:11:57,840 --> 00:11:58,840
Go!

194
00:11:59,679 --> 00:12:01,320
- Yuan Bao!   - Oh, no.

195
00:12:01,400 --> 00:12:02,400
Don't be fooled by it!

196
00:12:03,119 --> 00:12:04,119
Shu Ya.

197
00:12:05,192 --> 00:12:06,192
Shu Ya.

198
00:12:06,679 --> 00:12:07,679
Just let him go.

199
00:12:08,239 --> 00:12:09,240
You know that's impossible.

200
00:12:09,320 --> 00:12:10,792
But he's my best friend.

201
00:12:11,440 --> 00:12:13,993
I don't understand why you hate it so much.

202
00:12:14,719 --> 00:12:15,833
Best friend?

203
00:12:17,080 --> 00:12:17,683
Yuan Bao,

204
00:12:18,280 --> 00:12:20,080
do you know who this fox demon is?

205
00:12:23,320 --> 00:12:24,399
You treat it as a friend,

206
00:12:24,479 --> 00:12:26,073
but it might not see you as one.

207
00:12:26,719 --> 00:12:27,719
If you keep protecting it,

208
00:12:27,960 --> 00:12:29,273
you'll regret it one day.

209
00:12:30,599 --> 00:12:31,833
You've known me for years.

210
00:12:32,359 --> 00:12:33,672
You know what kind of person I am.

211
00:12:34,119 --> 00:12:35,672
If I see someone as my friend,

212
00:12:36,119 --> 00:12:37,760
no matter what others say about them,

213
00:12:37,840 --> 00:12:39,073
they are my friend.

214
00:12:39,679 --> 00:12:41,352
So I won't let you

215
00:12:41,559 --> 00:12:42,559
kill it today.

216
00:12:42,919 --> 00:12:43,953
So that thing is your friend.

217
00:12:44,873 --> 00:12:45,873
I'm nobody.

218
00:12:48,679 --> 00:12:50,273
Do you really care about it that much?

219
00:12:51,719 --> 00:12:52,719
Shu Ya,

220
00:12:53,399 --> 00:12:54,752
I know you're worried about me.

221
00:12:55,520 --> 00:12:56,520
But please,

222
00:12:56,719 --> 00:12:57,719
let it go.

223
00:12:57,840 --> 00:12:59,032
Don't make things difficult for me.

224
00:13:03,200 --> 00:13:04,200
Okay,

225
00:13:04,640 --> 00:13:05,640
if that's the case,

226
00:13:06,760 --> 00:13:08,112
I'll let it go today.

227
00:13:09,819 --> 00:13:10,819
That's great!

228
00:13:11,039 --> 00:13:12,513
Little fox, go now.

229
00:13:21,679 --> 00:13:22,679
Little fox!

230
00:13:23,440 --> 00:13:24,440
Yuan Bao!

231
00:13:49,599 --> 00:13:50,599
Chang Yue?

232
00:14:11,520 --> 00:14:12,520
Shu Ya.

233
00:14:13,239 --> 00:14:14,239
What happened to Yuan Bao?

234
00:14:14,640 --> 00:14:16,227
- She fell off the cliff.   - What?

235
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:19,799
Mr. Qi, it's all my fault.

236
00:14:20,119 --> 00:14:22,000
- I didn't catch her.   - This isn't the time for this.

237
00:14:22,080 --> 00:14:23,440
- Let's find Yuan Bao first.   - Right.

238
00:14:23,533 --> 00:14:24,887
- Let's go.   - Let's go.

239
00:14:36,119 --> 00:14:37,119
- Your wound.   - Stop.

240
00:14:38,799 --> 00:14:39,799
You...

241
00:14:41,760 --> 00:14:45,032
You're that little fox.

242
00:14:47,359 --> 00:14:48,393
Impossible.

243
00:14:48,520 --> 00:14:50,313
You have to be kidding me.

244
00:14:55,895 --> 00:14:57,495
You must be using some kind of illusion

245
00:14:57,520 --> 00:14:59,152
or some weird sorcery?

246
00:14:59,320 --> 00:15:00,760
Chang Yue, stop it.

247
00:15:00,840 --> 00:15:03,193
This isn't funny at all.

248
00:15:05,252 --> 00:15:05,948
Yuan Bao,

249
00:15:07,919 --> 00:15:08,675
there's no illusion.

250
00:15:10,119 --> 00:15:11,119
And no sorcery either.

251
00:15:15,559 --> 00:15:16,559
So...

252
00:15:18,440 --> 00:15:21,393
You really are that little fox.

253
00:15:48,960 --> 00:15:50,193
Then we already...

254
00:15:51,960 --> 00:15:53,479
I shouldn't have saved you just now.

255
00:15:53,559 --> 00:15:54,680
I should've let my father

256
00:15:54,760 --> 00:15:56,479
catch you, you sly fox.

257
00:15:56,559 --> 00:15:58,279
- Yuan Bao, I...   - Don't come closer.

258
00:15:58,359 --> 00:15:59,359
Let me calm down.

259
00:16:00,080 --> 00:16:01,080
No.

260
00:16:03,039 --> 00:16:04,873
I'll go calm down myself.

261
00:16:05,039 --> 00:16:06,039
Don't follow me.

262
00:16:24,799 --> 00:16:26,912
You're injured. Let's go inside and rest for a while.

263
00:16:33,760 --> 00:16:35,873
Stay here. I'll go in myself.

264
00:16:50,119 --> 00:16:51,792
The little fox is Chang Yue.

265
00:16:52,200 --> 00:16:53,712
And Chang Yue is the little fox.

266
00:16:54,400 --> 00:16:55,400
So I

267
00:16:55,479 --> 00:16:56,712
took a bath and slept with him.

268
00:16:58,719 --> 00:17:00,273
I might as well die.

269
00:17:04,160 --> 00:17:05,160
Hold on.

270
00:17:05,839 --> 00:17:07,279
We've already taken a bath

271
00:17:07,359 --> 00:17:08,519
and slept together.

272
00:17:08,599 --> 00:17:10,153
Then kissing him shouldn't be a big deal.

273
00:17:10,239 --> 00:17:11,352
Why is he so upset?

274
00:17:13,040 --> 00:17:14,513
Oh, Chang Yue.

275
00:17:14,800 --> 00:17:17,040
You pretend to be so serious and aloof.

276
00:17:17,120 --> 00:17:18,120
I was almost fooled.

277
00:17:18,160 --> 00:17:19,160
despite my experience.

278
00:17:19,760 --> 00:17:20,960
You're not someone

279
00:17:21,040 --> 00:17:22,072
innocent at all,

280
00:17:22,359 --> 00:17:23,560
but a cunning,

281
00:17:23,640 --> 00:17:24,712
scheming old fox.

282
00:17:25,199 --> 00:17:27,393
You might even be a philanderer.

283
00:17:30,400 --> 00:17:32,400
Yuan Bao, are you okay?

284
00:17:32,880 --> 00:17:34,472
I'm fine. Don't come in.

285
00:17:55,040 --> 00:17:56,553
That really hurts.

286
00:17:58,239 --> 00:18:00,153
But it's a good thing I took the hit.

287
00:18:00,479 --> 00:18:02,312
The little fox was already injured.

288
00:18:03,040 --> 00:18:04,040
If...

289
00:18:06,119 --> 00:18:07,119
Hold on.

290
00:18:07,719 --> 00:18:09,112
Chang Yue is hurt.

291
00:18:12,319 --> 00:18:13,319
Chang Yue!

292
00:18:16,520 --> 00:18:17,520
Chang Yue!

293
00:18:18,959 --> 00:18:19,959
Chang Yue!

294
00:18:22,160 --> 00:18:23,160
Where is he?

295
00:18:24,199 --> 00:18:25,553
Did he leave again?

296
00:18:27,119 --> 00:18:28,119
Chang Yue!

297
00:18:30,680 --> 00:18:32,800
That stupid fox.

298
00:18:32,880 --> 00:18:34,072
He always leaves without a word.

299
00:18:34,839 --> 00:18:36,153
I'm not looking for you this time.

300
00:18:36,479 --> 00:18:38,359
If I do that, I'm an idiot.

301
00:18:41,880 --> 00:18:42,600
Chang Yue!

302
00:18:46,079 --> 00:18:47,079
Chang Yue!

303
00:18:48,332 --> 00:18:49,913
Chang Yue, where are you?

304
00:18:51,560 --> 00:18:52,560
Chang Yue!

305
00:18:54,160 --> 00:18:55,160
Chang Yue!

306
00:18:55,680 --> 00:18:56,680
Are you looking for me?

307
00:19:01,239 --> 00:19:03,072
Where did you go just now?

308
00:19:08,800 --> 00:19:09,800
I went to gather herbs.

309
00:19:22,599 --> 00:19:23,599
Chang Yue,

310
00:19:24,920 --> 00:19:26,033
I remember

311
00:19:26,439 --> 00:19:28,232
you have some serious injuries.

312
00:19:30,599 --> 00:19:31,993
How did you get those injuries?

313
00:19:36,599 --> 00:19:37,599
You can't say how?

314
00:19:40,079 --> 00:19:41,192
It was just an accident.

315
00:19:41,560 --> 00:19:43,913
An accident gave you serious injuries?

316
00:19:45,839 --> 00:19:46,285
Then,

317
00:19:47,319 --> 00:19:48,879
where have you been lately?

318
00:19:48,959 --> 00:19:50,153
You can tell me that, right?

319
00:19:50,359 --> 00:19:51,359
I went back to Beiming.

320
00:19:51,560 --> 00:19:54,359
So, all these injuries...

321
00:19:54,439 --> 00:19:55,673
you got them in Beiming?

322
00:20:00,079 --> 00:20:01,633
These injuries are nothing.

323
00:20:02,599 --> 00:20:03,599
Your injuries

324
00:20:03,679 --> 00:20:04,679
look more serious.

325
00:20:05,119 --> 00:20:06,561
Let me treat your wounds.

326
00:20:06,641 --> 00:20:08,112
How?

327
00:20:19,079 --> 00:20:20,079
Yuan Bao,

328
00:20:21,119 --> 00:20:22,119
actually,

329
00:20:22,640 --> 00:20:24,312
I didn't mean to hide my identity on purpose.

330
00:20:25,400 --> 00:20:26,400
Nor did I mean to...

331
00:20:27,560 --> 00:20:28,560
To what?

332
00:20:32,839 --> 00:20:33,839
When you were bathing,

333
00:20:34,760 --> 00:20:36,560
- I...   - All right. Stop it.

334
00:20:36,640 --> 00:20:37,640
Say no more.

335
00:20:40,880 --> 00:20:41,993
I'm going in to dress the wound.

336
00:20:42,199 --> 00:20:44,199
Don't follow me. And no peeking!

337
00:21:08,719 --> 00:21:09,920
What exactly

338
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:11,712
has Chang Yue been through lately?

339
00:21:12,359 --> 00:21:13,633
How come I feel like

340
00:21:14,040 --> 00:21:16,112
he's full of mysteries?

341
00:21:35,952 --> 00:21:37,579
Yuan Bao, do you need help?

342
00:21:37,992 --> 00:21:39,880
No, don't need to come in.

343
00:22:08,880 --> 00:22:10,112
Perhaps you should help.

344
00:22:34,400 --> 00:22:35,472
Lower.

345
00:22:42,239 --> 00:22:43,239
I'll be gentle.

346
00:23:23,119 --> 00:23:24,873
(Qi Yuan Bao, have you lost your mind?)

347
00:23:25,160 --> 00:23:26,753
(Why do you always think about touching him?)

348
00:24:22,920 --> 00:24:23,920
I...

349
00:24:30,920 --> 00:24:32,399
You still think

350
00:24:32,479 --> 00:24:33,633
you're a little fox, huh?

351
00:24:33,880 --> 00:24:34,913
You actually tried to bite me.

352
00:24:42,199 --> 00:24:44,920
Forget it. Since you're a fox,

353
00:24:45,000 --> 00:24:46,000
I won't hold it against you.

354
00:24:47,760 --> 00:24:48,760
But

355
00:24:49,479 --> 00:24:50,479
Master,

356
00:24:51,479 --> 00:24:53,913
don't tell me you often turn into a fox

357
00:24:54,119 --> 00:24:55,920
and then sneak into women's bathtubs

358
00:24:56,000 --> 00:24:57,000
to do bad things.

359
00:24:57,040 --> 00:24:58,472
Have I ever done any bad thing to you?

360
00:24:59,520 --> 00:25:02,080
The things you've done to me are bad things.

361
00:25:02,160 --> 00:25:02,878
Such as?

362
00:25:17,280 --> 00:25:18,393
You know what.

363
00:25:21,560 --> 00:25:22,560
But in my memory,

364
00:25:29,079 --> 00:25:30,592
you carried me into the bathtub.

365
00:25:32,079 --> 00:25:34,200
And you were the one who invited me

366
00:25:34,280 --> 00:25:35,793
to your room every night.

367
00:25:37,800 --> 00:25:38,832
Drop it.

368
00:26:07,560 --> 00:26:08,560
Yuan Bao!

369
00:26:08,880 --> 00:26:10,553
- Yuan Bao!   - Yuan Bao!

370
00:26:10,800 --> 00:26:11,960
- Yuan Bao!   - Mr. Qi.

371
00:26:12,041 --> 00:26:13,646
There's a hut over there. Let's go check it out.

372
00:26:15,160 --> 00:26:16,160
Let's go.

373
00:26:16,959 --> 00:26:17,718
Yuan Bao!

374
00:26:18,800 --> 00:26:19,318
Father.

375
00:26:20,359 --> 00:26:21,359
- Father.   - Yuan Bao.

376
00:26:21,880 --> 00:26:22,452
Yuan Bao.

377
00:26:23,000 --> 00:26:24,479
- Father.   - Yuan Bao, are you okay?

378
00:26:25,631 --> 00:26:26,945
Yuan Bao, come home with me.

379
00:26:27,280 --> 00:26:28,472
Let me check on your injuries.

380
00:26:28,839 --> 00:26:30,600
Don't worry, Father. It's just a scratch.

381
00:26:30,680 --> 00:26:31,993
- It's nothing serious.   - You...

382
00:26:32,640 --> 00:26:35,192
Yuan Bao, is that fox demon inside?

383
00:26:35,680 --> 00:26:36,467
Of course, not.

384
00:26:36,800 --> 00:26:38,279
That fox isn't stupid.

385
00:26:38,359 --> 00:26:39,673
It knows you're looking for it.

386
00:26:39,760 --> 00:26:42,112
It's not going to wait for you to catch it today.

387
00:26:43,040 --> 00:26:43,497
Shu Ya.

388
00:26:44,160 --> 00:26:45,160
Keep an eye on Yuan Bao.

389
00:26:46,160 --> 00:26:47,192
I'll go take a look.

390
00:26:48,880 --> 00:26:50,479
- Father!   - Yuan Bao.

391
00:26:50,760 --> 00:26:51,760
I'm sorry.

392
00:26:53,000 --> 00:26:54,432
If that fox demon isn't inside,

393
00:26:54,880 --> 00:26:56,232
why are you so nervous?

394
00:26:56,920 --> 00:26:58,153
I'm not nervous.

395
00:26:58,719 --> 00:27:00,673
Also Shu Ya,

396
00:27:00,920 --> 00:27:02,080
stop calling it

397
00:27:02,160 --> 00:27:03,513
a fox demon.

398
00:27:03,952 --> 00:27:06,105
That fox has never hurt me.

399
00:27:06,560 --> 00:27:08,592
Yuan Bao, you keep defending it.

400
00:27:12,439 --> 00:27:13,633
Are you in love with the fox?

401
00:27:14,400 --> 00:27:15,400
I...

402
00:27:16,400 --> 00:27:17,712
In love with the fox?

403
00:27:20,199 --> 00:27:21,640
- Mr. Qi.   - Father.

404
00:28:00,479 --> 00:28:02,153
I didn't find any trace of the fox demon.

405
00:28:02,319 --> 00:28:03,319
No?

406
00:28:04,119 --> 00:28:05,119
Let's go back.

407
00:28:06,233 --> 00:28:07,233
Come.

408
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:09,913
(Good thing Father didn't find Chang Yue.)

409
00:28:10,359 --> 00:28:11,359
(It'd be bad otherwise.)

410
00:28:12,280 --> 00:28:13,472
(So Chang Yue)

411
00:28:13,640 --> 00:28:15,112
(is indeed the fox demon.)

412
00:28:15,719 --> 00:28:16,719
(Chang Yue.)

413
00:28:17,040 --> 00:28:18,352
(You've escaped this time.)

414
00:28:19,400 --> 00:28:20,633
(But there won't be a next time.)

415
00:28:24,006 --> 00:28:25,193
- He's awake!   - Great,

416
00:28:26,719 --> 00:28:27,337
Take it easy.

417
00:28:34,040 --> 00:28:36,080
Send a message to Qishan Sect

418
00:28:36,160 --> 00:28:37,273
and the prestigious families.

419
00:28:37,760 --> 00:28:40,553
The fox demon has appeared and is slaughtering cultivators.

420
00:28:40,920 --> 00:28:42,273
We must gather to discuss

421
00:28:42,839 --> 00:28:43,913
how to eliminate the fox demon.

422
00:28:44,479 --> 00:28:45,832
The fox demon has appeared?

423
00:28:50,119 --> 00:28:51,592
Luckily, Chang Yue was there.

424
00:28:52,160 --> 00:28:53,312
When I see him next time,

425
00:28:54,319 --> 00:28:55,952
I must thank him properly.

426
00:28:56,439 --> 00:28:58,206
(Beixuan Inn)

427
00:29:29,000 --> 00:29:30,000
Sect Leader Qi.

428
00:29:30,439 --> 00:29:31,439
Feel free.

429
00:29:31,519 --> 00:29:32,519
Mr. Chang Yue,

430
00:29:33,199 --> 00:29:34,312
I'll keep it brief.

431
00:29:35,640 --> 00:29:36,640
I'm here today,

432
00:29:37,439 --> 00:29:38,753
firstly, to thank you

433
00:29:39,199 --> 00:29:41,393
for saving my daughter last night.

434
00:29:46,560 --> 00:29:48,712
And secondly, I have a request.

435
00:29:49,640 --> 00:29:52,200
I want you to leave this place as soon as possible

436
00:29:52,280 --> 00:29:53,432
and stay away from Yuan Bao.

437
00:30:01,439 --> 00:30:03,192
I didn't expose you in public yesterday

438
00:30:03,400 --> 00:30:05,072
partly because you saved my daughter,

439
00:30:05,800 --> 00:30:07,352
but also because I feel sorry for Yuan Bao.

440
00:30:07,839 --> 00:30:08,839
As you know,

441
00:30:09,239 --> 00:30:10,999
Yuan Bao is pure and passionate.

442
00:30:11,079 --> 00:30:12,273
She can love and she can hate.

443
00:30:12,959 --> 00:30:14,112
If she knew that you

444
00:30:14,880 --> 00:30:16,873
were approaching her with ulterior motives,

445
00:30:18,719 --> 00:30:20,472
I don't think she would ever forgive you.

446
00:30:22,119 --> 00:30:23,712
Moreover, for thousands of years,

447
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:25,993
humans and foxes have been irreconcilable.

448
00:30:26,359 --> 00:30:28,033
I will not allow Yuan Bao to marry you.

449
00:30:28,599 --> 00:30:30,720
I don't think the fox clan would agree to your

450
00:30:30,800 --> 00:30:32,592
marrying a human either.

451
00:30:33,680 --> 00:30:35,513
You and Yuan Bao have no future.

452
00:30:36,359 --> 00:30:37,393
I believe

453
00:30:38,479 --> 00:30:40,553
you know this better than anyone.

454
00:30:44,920 --> 00:30:45,920
Furthermore,

455
00:30:46,199 --> 00:30:48,480
Yuan Bao and Shu Ya grew up together.

456
00:30:48,560 --> 00:30:49,753
They are a perfect match.

457
00:30:50,160 --> 00:30:51,759
Soon, I will betroth Yuan Bao

458
00:30:51,839 --> 00:30:53,072
to Shu Ya.

459
00:30:54,160 --> 00:30:55,232
After they get married,

460
00:30:55,640 --> 00:30:57,152
they will definitely become

461
00:30:57,400 --> 00:30:58,913
a happy couple.

462
00:31:04,040 --> 00:31:05,040
All right.

463
00:31:05,280 --> 00:31:07,113
I've said what I needed to say today.

464
00:31:07,560 --> 00:31:08,560
And now,

465
00:31:09,280 --> 00:31:11,072
think about it.

466
00:31:17,319 --> 00:31:19,393
If you do not leave,

467
00:31:19,760 --> 00:31:20,760
then for Yuan Bao's sake,

468
00:31:21,560 --> 00:31:22,832
I show no mercy

469
00:31:24,359 --> 00:31:25,832
in the future.

470
00:31:35,239 --> 00:31:36,513
(You keep defending it.)

471
00:31:37,000 --> 00:31:38,232
(Are you in love with the fox?)

472
00:31:38,998 --> 00:31:40,072
In love?

473
00:31:42,958 --> 00:31:44,759
Yuan Bao, how's your injury?

474
00:31:45,079 --> 00:31:46,112
Are you all right?

475
00:31:47,359 --> 00:31:48,478
I'm asking how your injury is.

476
00:31:48,959 --> 00:31:50,312
You've been muttering to yourself.

477
00:31:50,760 --> 00:31:51,832
I didn't hear you.

478
00:31:52,079 --> 00:31:54,112
I've dressed the wound. It will heal soon.

479
00:31:55,400 --> 00:31:56,432
If you ask me,

480
00:31:56,640 --> 00:31:58,472
you brought it on yourself.

481
00:31:58,680 --> 00:32:00,119
- I...   - What are you talking about?

482
00:32:00,199 --> 00:32:01,199
Am I wrong?

483
00:32:02,000 --> 00:32:03,839
Qi Yuan Bao, are you out of your mind?

484
00:32:04,040 --> 00:32:05,673
You were willing to risk your life for a fox.

485
00:32:08,199 --> 00:32:09,840
Forget it, why should I explain to you guys?

486
00:32:09,920 --> 00:32:11,519
- You wouldn't understand.   - Me?

487
00:32:11,599 --> 00:32:12,599
Are you looking down on me?

488
00:32:13,400 --> 00:32:15,312
Yuan Bao, what exactly did you want to say?

489
00:32:30,599 --> 00:32:31,599
Tell me.

490
00:32:32,640 --> 00:32:33,640
Have you

491
00:32:36,199 --> 00:32:38,712
ever fallen for someone?

492
00:32:44,359 --> 00:32:45,553
What?

493
00:32:45,980 --> 00:32:48,312
Why do you guys look so guilty?

494
00:32:48,560 --> 00:32:50,439
Don't tell me you're hiding your crush from me?

495
00:32:50,760 --> 00:32:53,107
- Of course, not!   - Of course, not!

496
00:32:53,439 --> 00:32:54,439
Is this a joke?

497
00:32:54,479 --> 00:32:55,639
What is this?

498
00:32:55,719 --> 00:32:56,873
Impossible.

499
00:32:58,400 --> 00:32:59,400
Impossible.

500
00:32:59,959 --> 00:33:00,959
Right?

501
00:33:02,079 --> 00:33:03,079
Never mind.

502
00:33:03,560 --> 00:33:04,560
I should've known.

503
00:33:05,000 --> 00:33:06,873
If I haven't even figured it out,

504
00:33:07,079 --> 00:33:09,273
how could you two figure it out ahead of me?

505
00:33:12,079 --> 00:33:12,779
Yuan Bao,

506
00:33:13,259 --> 00:33:14,613
why are you asking this?

507
00:33:16,520 --> 00:33:17,592
I mean,

508
00:33:18,199 --> 00:33:19,793
what does it feel like to be in love

509
00:33:20,359 --> 00:33:21,553
with someone?

510
00:33:25,359 --> 00:33:28,352
You'll be so preoccupied with him

511
00:33:29,680 --> 00:33:31,835
that you can't eat

512
00:33:32,079 --> 00:33:34,273
or sleep.

513
00:33:36,199 --> 00:33:38,393
(When Chang Yue was gone,)

514
00:33:39,760 --> 00:33:41,712
(I seemed to be like that all the time.)

515
00:33:43,359 --> 00:33:45,153
(If I have fallen for Chang Yue,)

516
00:33:46,079 --> 00:33:47,079
(what about him?)

517
00:33:49,839 --> 00:33:51,072
Why are you asking this?

518
00:33:52,479 --> 00:33:53,479
One more question.

519
00:33:53,839 --> 00:33:56,312
What kind of girl

520
00:33:57,040 --> 00:33:58,592
would a well-mannered man like?

521
00:33:59,479 --> 00:34:01,393
Well-mannered?

522
00:34:02,959 --> 00:34:04,519
Definitely

523
00:34:04,599 --> 00:34:05,913
not someone like you.

524
00:34:06,760 --> 00:34:07,760
Why not someone like me?

525
00:34:07,800 --> 00:34:08,800
What's wrong with me?

526
00:34:09,080 --> 00:34:11,353
You don't believe me? Ask him.

527
00:34:11,465 --> 00:34:12,686
Me? I...

528
00:34:13,439 --> 00:34:14,439
Tell me.

529
00:34:15,320 --> 00:34:16,320
Yuan Bao,

530
00:34:16,639 --> 00:34:18,033
it's not that you're not good.

531
00:34:19,120 --> 00:34:20,553
Take Chang Yue for example,

532
00:34:20,760 --> 00:34:21,760
He is the typical

533
00:34:21,840 --> 00:34:23,159
well-mannered person.

534
00:34:23,239 --> 00:34:24,912
He wouldn't like

535
00:34:25,520 --> 00:34:27,560
someone as bold as you.

536
00:34:28,120 --> 00:34:29,560
- I...   - That's right.

537
00:34:29,800 --> 00:34:31,232
Someone like Chang Yue

538
00:34:31,655 --> 00:34:34,255
would like someone gentle, charming,

539
00:34:34,280 --> 00:34:36,033
knowledgeable, elegant, and sweet.

540
00:34:37,320 --> 00:34:39,159
Anyway, it's the opposite of you.

541
00:34:39,998 --> 00:34:41,912
Forget it. Go away. Leave me alone.

542
00:34:44,800 --> 00:34:46,639
Don't just gawk at me. Go out.

543
00:34:46,719 --> 00:34:47,799
- Did we   - Go.

544
00:34:47,879 --> 00:34:49,481
- say something wrong?   - Get up and leave.

545
00:34:49,561 --> 00:34:50,760
Get out.

546
00:34:50,840 --> 00:34:51,840
Yuan Bao.

547
00:34:54,080 --> 00:34:55,080
We...

548
00:34:55,320 --> 00:34:56,513
Did we say something wrong?

549
00:34:57,159 --> 00:34:57,638
No.

550
00:34:59,840 --> 00:35:00,112
I think.

551
00:35:00,952 --> 00:35:02,352
Forget it. Let's go.

552
00:35:02,384 --> 00:35:02,984
Wait.

553
00:35:05,439 --> 00:35:07,632
I have something I want to give you.

554
00:35:16,000 --> 00:35:18,113
Weren't you buying it for Qi Yuan Bao?

555
00:35:18,320 --> 00:35:19,353
Don't you like it?

556
00:35:19,600 --> 00:35:20,600
So I'm giving it to you.

557
00:35:22,360 --> 00:35:23,360
That's more like it.

558
00:35:23,639 --> 00:35:25,353
After all, I've given Yuan Bao

559
00:35:25,479 --> 00:35:26,479
many combs.

560
00:35:26,559 --> 00:35:27,920
She probably wouldn't want

561
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:29,152
another comb either.

562
00:35:32,360 --> 00:35:33,753
If Qi Yuan Bao doesn't want it,

563
00:35:34,000 --> 00:35:35,000
I don't want it either.

564
00:35:38,879 --> 00:35:39,879
