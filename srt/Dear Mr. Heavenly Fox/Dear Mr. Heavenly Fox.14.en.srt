1
00:01:48,932 --> 00:01:53,919
(Dear Mr. Heavenly Fox)

2
00:01:54,079 --> 00:01:57,006
(Episode 14)

3
00:02:03,480 --> 00:02:05,272
Charming and cute.

4
00:02:06,559 --> 00:02:07,039
Like this?

5
00:02:09,240 --> 00:02:10,240
No, this won't do.

6
00:02:21,919 --> 00:02:23,752
What does being knowledgeable and refined look like?

7
00:02:26,880 --> 00:02:27,880
Like this?

8
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:31,552
That's not right either.

9
00:02:31,880 --> 00:02:33,272
(Just yesterday, I thought Yuan Bao)

10
00:02:33,559 --> 00:02:35,873
(was still a little girl to be cherished.)

11
00:02:36,320 --> 00:02:37,320
(But in the blink of an eye,)

12
00:02:37,960 --> 00:02:39,672
(she's already grown up.)

13
00:02:41,039 --> 00:02:42,233
Gentle and lovely?

14
00:02:45,039 --> 00:02:46,240
What knowledgeable and refined,

15
00:02:46,267 --> 00:02:47,779
gentle and lovely?

16
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:49,793
Why is it so hard to be a woman?

17
00:02:50,360 --> 00:02:51,360
What's troubling

18
00:02:51,399 --> 00:02:52,520
my invincible

19
00:02:52,600 --> 00:02:53,600
daughter?

20
00:02:53,800 --> 00:02:54,800
Father!

21
00:02:54,960 --> 00:02:55,960
Father.

22
00:02:58,759 --> 00:02:59,793
Getting dressed up?

23
00:03:00,240 --> 00:03:02,073
Yes, but I've been trying everything

24
00:03:02,160 --> 00:03:03,593
and haven't found anything suitable.

25
00:03:09,759 --> 00:03:10,759
Here.

26
00:03:14,199 --> 00:03:16,233
Only this simple hairpin

27
00:03:16,320 --> 00:03:17,752
is worthy of my daughter.

28
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:22,192
When your mother was here,

29
00:03:22,839 --> 00:03:24,513
I often helped her get ready.

30
00:03:25,520 --> 00:03:26,593
As long as she was happy,

31
00:03:27,119 --> 00:03:28,119
I was happy too.

32
00:03:33,600 --> 00:03:34,713
I wonder who will have

33
00:03:35,080 --> 00:03:36,433
the good fortune

34
00:03:36,639 --> 00:03:38,233
to help my daughter get ready in the future.

35
00:03:39,479 --> 00:03:41,752
Father, what are you talking about?

36
00:03:42,039 --> 00:03:44,313
I'm not planning to get married yet.

37
00:03:45,240 --> 00:03:46,632
Do you have someone you like right now?

38
00:03:54,279 --> 00:03:55,279
Yuan Bao,

39
00:03:55,720 --> 00:03:58,000
I want to talk to you

40
00:03:58,080 --> 00:03:59,080
about that little fox.

41
00:03:59,960 --> 00:04:00,960
Father,

42
00:04:01,039 --> 00:04:02,912
I know what you want to say.

43
00:04:03,160 --> 00:04:04,281
But that fox isn't like

44
00:04:04,361 --> 00:04:05,593
what Shu Ya said to be.

45
00:04:05,960 --> 00:04:07,199
He's really kind to me

46
00:04:07,279 --> 00:04:08,279
and has no ill intentions.

47
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:10,920
You're just too naive.

48
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:13,513
You can't see through what others are thinking.

49
00:04:13,880 --> 00:04:14,880
Maybe...

50
00:04:16,200 --> 00:04:18,153
Maybe he has ulterior motives.

51
00:04:19,480 --> 00:04:21,873
Father, what could he possibly want from me?

52
00:04:22,320 --> 00:04:23,599
Do you think your daughter has

53
00:04:23,679 --> 00:04:24,679
anything worth taking?

54
00:04:27,279 --> 00:04:28,279
Besides,

55
00:04:29,079 --> 00:04:30,792
others might have ulterior motives,

56
00:04:31,279 --> 00:04:33,392
but Chang Yue definitely doesn't have any.

57
00:04:33,760 --> 00:04:35,439
- Yuan Bao.   - Father,

58
00:04:35,519 --> 00:04:37,952
I know. Don't worry.

59
00:04:38,160 --> 00:04:40,272
Who do you think could ever hurt your daughter?

60
00:04:42,519 --> 00:04:43,519
Father!

61
00:04:51,239 --> 00:04:53,153
(And secondly, I have a request.)

62
00:04:53,880 --> 00:04:56,352
(I want you to leave this place as soon as possible)

63
00:04:56,679 --> 00:04:57,873
(and stay away from Yuan Bao.)

64
00:04:59,559 --> 00:05:02,080
Yuan Bao and Shu Ya are a perfect match.

65
00:05:02,160 --> 00:05:03,439
They are in love with each other.

66
00:05:03,519 --> 00:05:05,552
(Soon, I will betroth Yuan Bao)

67
00:05:05,760 --> 00:05:06,760
(to Shu Ya.)

68
00:05:07,119 --> 00:05:08,193
(After they get married,)

69
00:05:08,519 --> 00:05:10,232
(they will definitely become)

70
00:05:10,600 --> 00:05:12,232
a happy couple.

71
00:05:26,559 --> 00:05:28,153
(I wonder if Chang Yue)

72
00:05:28,880 --> 00:05:30,633
(would like this outfit or not.)

73
00:06:01,640 --> 00:06:02,640
Yuan Bao.

74
00:06:13,600 --> 00:06:14,600
Master.

75
00:06:15,399 --> 00:06:18,112
Did you sleep well last night?

76
00:06:18,720 --> 00:06:19,272
Very well.

77
00:06:19,920 --> 00:06:20,438
And you?

78
00:06:23,279 --> 00:06:26,672
I slept pretty well too.

79
00:06:33,880 --> 00:06:34,880
How's your injury?

80
00:06:35,279 --> 00:06:36,279
Is it getting better?

81
00:06:38,320 --> 00:06:39,320
Much better.

82
00:06:42,519 --> 00:06:43,386
Today...

83
00:06:47,320 --> 00:06:48,792
You seem especially cute and gentle.

84
00:06:50,799 --> 00:06:51,799
Really?

85
00:06:52,320 --> 00:06:55,753
So you like this?

86
00:06:57,359 --> 00:06:58,359
Then...

87
00:06:59,399 --> 00:07:00,399
Master,

88
00:07:00,839 --> 00:07:03,313
are you free later?

89
00:07:04,399 --> 00:07:05,399
Is something the matter?

90
00:07:10,160 --> 00:07:11,279
You have

91
00:07:11,359 --> 00:07:13,112
a special identity.

92
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:15,439
You probably haven't

93
00:07:15,519 --> 00:07:17,072
had fun in the mortal realm before.

94
00:07:17,559 --> 00:07:19,879
Do you want to experience

95
00:07:19,959 --> 00:07:20,959
the various facets

96
00:07:21,119 --> 00:07:23,033
of the mortal realm?

97
00:07:29,279 --> 00:07:30,279
You can't say no!

98
00:07:40,079 --> 00:07:41,079
Then...

99
00:07:41,799 --> 00:07:43,392
please show me your world.

100
00:07:43,880 --> 00:07:44,880
Okay?

101
00:07:46,079 --> 00:07:47,672
My world?

102
00:07:50,760 --> 00:07:52,072
There is a beauty.

103
00:07:52,320 --> 00:07:53,512
Once seen, never forgotten.

104
00:07:55,119 --> 00:07:57,072
Not seeing her for a day,

105
00:07:57,799 --> 00:07:59,913
I miss her madly.

106
00:08:00,640 --> 00:08:01,759
Great poem! Wonderful poem!

107
00:08:01,839 --> 00:08:03,913
- Wonderful.   - What a good poem.

108
00:08:10,440 --> 00:08:11,633
Not seeing her for a day,

109
00:08:12,359 --> 00:08:13,359
I miss her madly.

110
00:08:17,160 --> 00:08:18,633
Great poem! Wonderful poem!

111
00:08:20,880 --> 00:08:21,880
Yuan Bao,

112
00:08:22,239 --> 00:08:23,239
let's go somewhere else.

113
00:08:25,760 --> 00:08:26,952
Why, Master?

114
00:08:27,079 --> 00:08:28,672
Is it not good here?

115
00:08:32,632 --> 00:08:34,226
Where do you want to go, Master?

116
00:08:36,159 --> 00:08:37,159
The gambling den.

117
00:08:38,919 --> 00:08:39,919
It's...

118
00:08:41,159 --> 00:08:43,873
It's not a good choice, Master.

119
00:08:44,587 --> 00:08:45,812
Gentlemen.

120
00:08:45,892 --> 00:08:48,104
Move aside. Make way for my master.

121
00:08:48,184 --> 00:08:49,297
Come, Master.

122
00:08:49,720 --> 00:08:50,793
Excuse me, excuse me.

123
00:08:51,345 --> 00:08:52,606
Gentlemen,

124
00:08:52,686 --> 00:08:53,718
long time no see.

125
00:08:53,798 --> 00:08:55,400
- Make way for my master.   - Come.

126
00:08:55,480 --> 00:08:56,480
Come.

127
00:08:56,559 --> 00:08:57,559
Master, here.

128
00:08:58,665 --> 00:09:00,535
Today, I'm the banker.

129
00:09:00,615 --> 00:09:01,615
Okay.

130
00:09:05,439 --> 00:09:06,439
We continue.

131
00:09:07,265 --> 00:09:08,265
Come.

132
00:09:19,559 --> 00:09:21,592
You're really amazing, Master!

133
00:09:23,305 --> 00:09:24,116
Shake.

134
00:09:27,119 --> 00:09:28,918
- Big or small?   - Small.

135
00:09:28,998 --> 00:09:29,998
Small.

136
00:09:33,039 --> 00:09:35,073
Master, you're awesome!

137
00:09:35,200 --> 00:09:36,200
You're awesome!

138
00:09:37,799 --> 00:09:39,200
Come. Keep going.

139
00:09:39,286 --> 00:09:40,286
(Sihai Gambling Den)

140
00:09:46,200 --> 00:09:47,352
What do you think, Master?

141
00:09:47,479 --> 00:09:48,753
Making money feels pretty good, huh?

142
00:09:49,599 --> 00:09:50,599
Not bad.

143
00:09:50,733 --> 00:09:51,733
Let's go.

144
00:09:53,960 --> 00:09:55,352
(All I ever want in life)

145
00:09:55,652 --> 00:09:57,073
(is to get rich)

146
00:09:57,320 --> 00:09:58,320
(and enjoy eye candies.)

147
00:09:59,039 --> 00:10:01,073
(And I have both now.)

148
00:10:01,520 --> 00:10:03,833
(I've really reached the peak of my life!)

149
00:10:06,465 --> 00:10:07,465
Yuan Bao.

150
00:10:08,626 --> 00:10:09,626
Coming!

151
00:10:11,239 --> 00:10:12,599
Master. No, wait.

152
00:10:12,679 --> 00:10:13,679
You're my disciple now.

153
00:10:13,792 --> 00:10:15,399
Hungry? What do you want for dinner?

154
00:10:15,479 --> 00:10:16,792
I'll buy you dinner.

155
00:10:23,733 --> 00:10:24,733
Let's go.

156
00:10:29,440 --> 00:10:31,073
Roasted pig lungs, coming up!

157
00:10:32,479 --> 00:10:33,479
A pair of lamb kidneys!

158
00:10:34,159 --> 00:10:35,273
A serving of pig intestines!

159
00:10:36,014 --> 00:10:38,232
And this nutritious and delicious ox pizzle.

160
00:10:38,339 --> 00:10:39,339
Enjoy the meal.

161
00:10:47,440 --> 00:10:48,440
Try it.

162
00:10:49,479 --> 00:10:52,120
(He likes girls who are gentle, charming,)

163
00:10:52,200 --> 00:10:53,912
(knowledgeable, graceful, and sweet.)

164
00:10:58,559 --> 00:11:00,873
A lady shouldn't eat this.

165
00:11:01,440 --> 00:11:03,672
It's uncouth.

166
00:11:03,799 --> 00:11:05,313
I never eat this.

167
00:11:06,960 --> 00:11:07,960
Master,

168
00:11:08,159 --> 00:11:09,672
how about we get some

169
00:11:09,880 --> 00:11:11,513
delicacies?

170
00:11:12,960 --> 00:11:13,960
You don't like them?

171
00:11:14,799 --> 00:11:15,799
Of course, I don't.

172
00:11:15,840 --> 00:11:17,120
Why would I enjoy

173
00:11:17,200 --> 00:11:18,592
eating this?

174
00:11:22,919 --> 00:11:23,919
But I like them.

175
00:11:27,625 --> 00:11:28,400
Really?

176
00:11:41,400 --> 00:11:42,400
Don't choke.

177
00:11:43,559 --> 00:11:44,559
Thanks, Master.

178
00:11:46,080 --> 00:11:47,080
Oh, right, Master,

179
00:11:47,239 --> 00:11:49,032
what do people from Beiming like to eat?

180
00:11:50,200 --> 00:11:51,200
Lizards.

181
00:11:51,960 --> 00:11:52,960
Frogs.

182
00:11:53,599 --> 00:11:54,599
Insects.

183
00:11:57,239 --> 00:11:59,633
Master, is that all you usually eat?

184
00:12:00,126 --> 00:12:01,559
In comparison,

185
00:12:01,799 --> 00:12:03,468
I like the mortal world better.

186
00:12:08,640 --> 00:12:09,640
Master,

187
00:12:10,719 --> 00:12:12,920
Beiming must be very far

188
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:14,000
from Beixuan City.

189
00:12:14,200 --> 00:12:15,313
Why did you come here?

190
00:12:20,080 --> 00:12:21,433
I lost something here.

191
00:12:21,840 --> 00:12:22,840
Have you found it yet?

192
00:12:25,080 --> 00:12:26,080
Soon.

193
00:12:27,440 --> 00:12:28,959
Then, after you find

194
00:12:29,039 --> 00:12:30,193
what you're looking for,

195
00:12:30,985 --> 00:12:31,799
will you go back?

196
00:12:39,719 --> 00:12:40,719
I will go back.

197
00:12:44,960 --> 00:12:48,273
After you go back,

198
00:12:49,239 --> 00:12:50,753
will you come back again?

199
00:13:00,359 --> 00:13:01,592
If you want me to come back,

200
00:13:03,320 --> 00:13:04,320
I will.

201
00:13:05,159 --> 00:13:06,472
Of course, I want you to come back.

202
00:13:09,080 --> 00:13:10,393
Tomorrow is the Qiqiao Festival.

203
00:13:10,840 --> 00:13:11,920
Will ask your crush out

204
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:13,193
to see the lanterns together?

205
00:13:13,520 --> 00:13:14,520
Isn't that inappropriate?

206
00:13:15,479 --> 00:13:17,112
A girl asking a guy out?

207
00:13:17,760 --> 00:13:19,313
People will look down on me.

208
00:13:19,400 --> 00:13:21,433
- Right.   - What's inappropriate about that?

209
00:13:21,599 --> 00:13:23,193
If you like someone, you should...

210
00:13:26,239 --> 00:13:27,792
(You should pursue them bravely)

211
00:13:27,960 --> 00:13:29,433
(regardless of what others think!)

212
00:13:30,640 --> 00:13:31,640
Master,

213
00:13:32,239 --> 00:13:34,712
do you have plans for tomorrow night?

214
00:13:37,200 --> 00:13:38,200
No.

215
00:13:38,559 --> 00:13:40,159
What a coincidence. I don't have plans either.

216
00:13:40,479 --> 00:13:42,073
Then tomorrow night,

217
00:13:42,200 --> 00:13:43,592
let's go see the lanterns together.

218
00:13:48,640 --> 00:13:50,572
Don't get me wrong. That's not what I meant.

219
00:13:50,760 --> 00:13:51,760
I just...

220
00:13:52,080 --> 00:13:53,880
- I just...   - Sure.

221
00:14:11,960 --> 00:14:13,393
Is Shu Ya not here?

222
00:14:16,387 --> 00:14:18,200
Then, I'll just leave the candy here for him.

223
00:14:19,760 --> 00:14:21,273
That way, his medicine won't be bitter.

224
00:14:37,320 --> 00:14:38,320
(Yuan Bao)

225
00:14:39,080 --> 00:14:40,393
(still cares about me.)

226
00:14:56,080 --> 00:14:57,592
I'm going to see the lanterns with Chang Yue.

227
00:14:57,719 --> 00:14:59,792
What should I do to make him like me?

228
00:15:00,479 --> 00:15:01,753
This is my first time.

229
00:15:02,253 --> 00:15:04,885
Someone please teach me how to impress a man.

230
00:15:28,432 --> 00:15:29,432
Shu Ya,

231
00:15:29,773 --> 00:15:31,038
I put some sugar in for you.

232
00:15:31,118 --> 00:15:32,118
It's not bitter at all.

233
00:15:32,300 --> 00:15:33,300
Drink it.

234
00:16:08,359 --> 00:16:09,472
Impress a man?

235
00:16:10,039 --> 00:16:11,719
You've been flirting with men for many years.

236
00:16:11,799 --> 00:16:13,032
You're a veteran.

237
00:16:13,679 --> 00:16:14,680
Shouldn't this

238
00:16:14,760 --> 00:16:16,592
be your forte?

239
00:16:17,440 --> 00:16:18,440
Well,

240
00:16:18,520 --> 00:16:20,240
while I am indeed

241
00:16:20,320 --> 00:16:21,680
the master

242
00:16:21,760 --> 00:16:22,873
in the game of love,

243
00:16:23,045 --> 00:16:25,839
but this situation is a bit...

244
00:16:27,479 --> 00:16:28,479
Special.

245
00:16:28,612 --> 00:16:29,726
How so?

246
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:33,032
The man I'm pursuing is

247
00:16:33,159 --> 00:16:34,712
pure, innocent,

248
00:16:34,952 --> 00:16:37,065
and sweet.

249
00:16:38,178 --> 00:16:39,313
Isn't that even easier?

250
00:16:39,520 --> 00:16:40,894
- How so?   - Come. Follow me.

251
00:16:41,119 --> 00:16:42,352
I knew you'd have a trick.

252
00:16:43,400 --> 00:16:45,240
The first trick to impressing a man

253
00:16:45,320 --> 00:16:48,032
is cheesy pick-up lines.

254
00:16:50,840 --> 00:16:51,993
What are cheesy pick-up lines?

255
00:16:52,540 --> 00:16:53,540
Good question.

256
00:16:53,719 --> 00:16:54,792
You two, go ahead.

257
00:16:58,766 --> 00:16:59,766
Baby,

258
00:17:00,556 --> 00:17:02,352
do you know what is missing?

259
00:17:02,919 --> 00:17:03,919
What is it?

260
00:17:03,985 --> 00:17:06,139
I'm missing you.

261
00:17:10,319 --> 00:17:11,393
What the heck?

262
00:17:11,959 --> 00:17:13,119
You don't get it.

263
00:17:13,199 --> 00:17:14,199
Is it not good?

264
00:17:14,400 --> 00:17:15,432
Get off the stage.

265
00:17:16,132 --> 00:17:17,878
- Let me demonstrate.   - Why are you pushing me?

266
00:17:18,065 --> 00:17:19,065
If you ask me,

267
00:17:19,359 --> 00:17:20,592
to impress someone like Chang Yue,

268
00:17:20,672 --> 00:17:21,672
your confession

269
00:17:22,160 --> 00:17:23,553
needs to be a bit more elegant.

270
00:17:25,599 --> 00:17:26,237
That makes sense.

271
00:17:26,760 --> 00:17:28,192
If it's so simple,

272
00:17:28,280 --> 00:17:29,220
try saying something.

273
00:17:30,439 --> 00:17:31,793
I will stay with you in life

274
00:17:32,119 --> 00:17:33,432
and in death.

275
00:17:34,199 --> 00:17:35,472
I will hold your hand

276
00:17:36,760 --> 00:17:38,352
until our hair turns white.

277
00:17:39,599 --> 00:17:40,599
What?

278
00:17:41,160 --> 00:17:42,393
I don't understand. Speak plainly.

279
00:17:42,920 --> 00:17:44,472
It means I love you to death.

280
00:17:45,160 --> 00:17:46,519
- How cheesy!   - So...

281
00:17:46,599 --> 00:17:48,273
So straightforward.

282
00:17:49,359 --> 00:17:50,633
That's not appropriate, is it?

283
00:17:51,040 --> 00:17:52,273
Let me try again.

284
00:17:52,959 --> 00:17:54,153
Yuan Bao,

285
00:17:54,479 --> 00:17:57,273
you must feed him well,

286
00:17:57,599 --> 00:18:00,312
buy him whatever he likes,

287
00:18:00,839 --> 00:18:02,399
and make him fall

288
00:18:02,479 --> 00:18:04,192
for your...

289
00:18:04,599 --> 00:18:07,153
Then he won't be able to leave you.

290
00:18:07,479 --> 00:18:08,479
Right.

291
00:18:09,920 --> 00:18:11,033
That may be true,

292
00:18:11,560 --> 00:18:12,832
but I'm worried

293
00:18:13,079 --> 00:18:16,080
that in the future, he's only in love with this, what should I do?

294
00:18:16,160 --> 00:18:17,793
Oh, Yuan Bao.

295
00:18:18,040 --> 00:18:19,432
Besides your money,

296
00:18:19,760 --> 00:18:23,072
you don't have anything else to make him fall in love with you.

297
00:18:24,040 --> 00:18:25,960
- Isn't that right?   - You're right.

298
00:18:26,040 --> 00:18:28,712
Tian, you can't be so blunt.

299
00:18:31,746 --> 00:18:32,746
Stop laughing.

300
00:18:32,880 --> 00:18:34,072
What a terrible idea! Get lost!

301
00:18:35,713 --> 00:18:36,713
Who else?

302
00:18:38,680 --> 00:18:39,237
Yuan Bao,

303
00:18:39,773 --> 00:18:41,886
this genius trick of mine

304
00:18:42,365 --> 00:18:44,718
is unprecedented

305
00:18:45,231 --> 00:18:46,231
and cannot be surpassed.

306
00:18:47,640 --> 00:18:48,640
Tell me.

307
00:18:48,665 --> 00:18:49,859
Take him to...

308
00:18:50,979 --> 00:18:51,979
The inn.

309
00:18:56,559 --> 00:18:57,559
No!

310
00:18:57,959 --> 00:19:01,072
You are a genius!

311
00:19:01,280 --> 00:19:02,280
Inn?

312
00:19:03,065 --> 00:19:04,259
What can you do in an inn?

313
00:19:05,839 --> 00:19:07,513
You're a lost cause.

314
00:19:09,012 --> 00:19:11,485
This is all I've learned.

315
00:19:12,040 --> 00:19:13,513
Take it back and study it carefully.

316
00:19:13,619 --> 00:19:15,658
Practice often and you'll master it.

317
00:19:22,199 --> 00:19:23,592
Don't read it now.

318
00:19:24,359 --> 00:19:25,913
Keep it safe.

319
00:19:26,319 --> 00:19:29,312
Study it carefully when you get back.

320
00:19:32,040 --> 00:19:33,040
Got it.

321
00:19:33,640 --> 00:19:35,200
You're the best.

322
00:19:35,280 --> 00:19:36,280
Don't mention it.

323
00:19:36,680 --> 00:19:37,680
He's a genius.

324
00:19:37,760 --> 00:19:38,832
As expected of him.

325
00:19:46,040 --> 00:19:48,279
What the... What is this? It hurts my eyes.

326
00:19:48,359 --> 00:19:49,393
I shouldn't read it.

327
00:19:57,319 --> 00:19:58,753
I finally found you!

328
00:19:59,959 --> 00:20:00,959
Bite him! Bite him!

329
00:20:01,040 --> 00:20:02,040
Bite him!

330
00:20:02,280 --> 00:20:03,280
Bite him!

331
00:20:03,719 --> 00:20:04,719
Bite him!

332
00:20:06,199 --> 00:20:07,712
Attack!

333
00:20:09,160 --> 00:20:10,160
Bite him!

334
00:20:11,439 --> 00:20:12,439
Xue Han Yu.

335
00:20:12,680 --> 00:20:13,680
What?

336
00:20:15,640 --> 00:20:19,232
Tonight, the hour of Xu, the Qishan Sect entrance.

337
00:20:20,479 --> 00:20:21,479
Be there or be square.

338
00:20:25,280 --> 00:20:26,280
What?

339
00:20:26,359 --> 00:20:27,553
How strange.

340
00:20:28,553 --> 00:20:29,553
Continue.

341
00:20:29,633 --> 00:20:30,680
Have you eaten?

342
00:20:30,760 --> 00:20:32,033
Put some strength into it!

343
00:20:45,040 --> 00:20:46,993
Chang Yue, you know what?

344
00:20:47,498 --> 00:20:48,731
We are both

345
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:50,153
quite excessive.

346
00:20:51,352 --> 00:20:53,393
- How so?   - You're excessively beautiful,

347
00:20:53,592 --> 00:20:55,064
and I'm excessively enamored.

348
00:20:58,079 --> 00:20:59,153
That's too corny.

349
00:20:59,319 --> 00:21:00,319
Oh, gosh.

350
00:21:00,359 --> 00:21:01,472
I'll find another one.

351
00:21:04,280 --> 00:21:05,280
This one's good.

352
00:21:07,839 --> 00:21:09,753
Chang Yue, you know what?

353
00:21:10,319 --> 00:21:12,200
I like to see you

354
00:21:12,280 --> 00:21:14,040
on windy days. Do you know why?

355
00:21:15,439 --> 00:21:16,439
Oh?

356
00:21:16,520 --> 00:21:17,520
Why?

357
00:21:18,560 --> 00:21:20,600
Because the wind will blow me

358
00:21:20,680 --> 00:21:22,192
into your arms.

359
00:21:24,880 --> 00:21:26,280
No. That's too eager.

360
00:21:26,360 --> 00:21:27,952
Chang Yue probably can't handle that.

361
00:21:28,199 --> 00:21:29,199
Let's find another one.

362
00:21:36,839 --> 00:21:37,839
Chang Yue,

363
00:21:38,599 --> 00:21:40,680
you've already messed up

364
00:21:40,760 --> 00:21:41,913
my heart,

365
00:21:42,439 --> 00:21:44,352
when are you planning

366
00:21:44,640 --> 00:21:47,033
to mess up my sheet?

367
00:22:00,887 --> 00:22:01,425
Come here.

368
00:22:12,280 --> 00:22:13,280
Chang Yue.

369
00:22:23,239 --> 00:22:24,239
Yuan Bao.

370
00:22:27,259 --> 00:22:28,259
Yuan Bao.

371
00:22:30,326 --> 00:22:31,326
Yuan Bao.

372
00:22:32,172 --> 00:22:33,172
Shu Ya.

373
00:22:33,319 --> 00:22:34,432
Do you want to see the lanterns?

374
00:22:34,666 --> 00:22:35,666
I heard it's very festive.

375
00:22:36,760 --> 00:22:37,832
(Surely Chang Yue)

376
00:22:37,959 --> 00:22:39,239
(hasn't experienced such festivities.)

377
00:22:39,319 --> 00:22:40,319
Yuan Bao.

378
00:22:40,560 --> 00:22:41,560
(When the time comes...)

379
00:22:42,072 --> 00:22:43,072
Yuan Bao,

380
00:22:43,740 --> 00:22:44,853
do you want to see the lanterns?

381
00:22:45,673 --> 00:22:47,233
- Yes!   - Great!

382
00:22:48,613 --> 00:22:50,321
The best spot is at the Lover's Bridge in the city,

383
00:22:50,401 --> 00:22:51,686
at the hour of Xu.

384
00:22:51,959 --> 00:22:53,080
Don't miss it.

385
00:22:53,160 --> 00:22:55,192
(The best spot is at the Lover's Bridge.)

386
00:22:55,552 --> 00:22:56,706
I should get going.

387
00:23:02,638 --> 00:23:04,192
(The Qiqiao Festival...)

388
00:23:04,998 --> 00:23:06,271
(It's such a good opportunity.)

389
00:23:06,760 --> 00:23:08,553
(How could I miss it?)

390
00:23:10,040 --> 00:23:11,040
(Chang Yue.)

391
00:23:11,959 --> 00:23:12,959
(Here I come!)

392
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:20,000
Su Qian Qian.

393
00:23:21,160 --> 00:23:22,160
You're here.

394
00:23:22,880 --> 00:23:23,993
I'm also here.

395
00:23:24,160 --> 00:23:25,633
What are you doing here?

396
00:23:26,800 --> 00:23:27,800
I'm not welcome?

397
00:23:27,880 --> 00:23:28,952
Didn't you say to meet

398
00:23:29,160 --> 00:23:31,232
at Qishan Sect entrance at the hour of Xu?

399
00:23:32,040 --> 00:23:33,040
- I...   - That's right.

400
00:23:33,239 --> 00:23:34,879
What's inside that brain of yours?

401
00:23:34,959 --> 00:23:35,959
Who would entertain you?

402
00:23:36,319 --> 00:23:37,999
You need to eat more to make yourself smarter.

403
00:23:38,079 --> 00:23:39,159
- I...   - Let's go. It's late.

404
00:23:39,239 --> 00:23:40,239
- You...   - Let's go.

405
00:23:42,359 --> 00:23:43,359
Xue Han Yu!

406
00:23:44,079 --> 00:23:45,352
That blockhead.

407
00:23:50,640 --> 00:23:52,440
Master! Something bad has happened!

408
00:23:52,520 --> 00:23:53,520
Something's wrong!

409
00:23:53,640 --> 00:23:55,720
- What's wrong?   - Come.

410
00:23:55,800 --> 00:23:57,873
Disciples from other sects are outside,

411
00:23:57,959 --> 00:23:59,513
including Sect Leader Su and Sect Leader Huo.

412
00:23:59,599 --> 00:24:01,112
They said the cultivators who went

413
00:24:01,199 --> 00:24:03,232
to Suiyue Mountain were killed by a fox demon.

414
00:24:03,599 --> 00:24:04,599
What?

415
00:24:04,719 --> 00:24:07,366
(Beixuan Inn)

416
00:24:09,706 --> 00:24:10,706
Master!

417
00:24:11,025 --> 00:24:12,025
You've been waiting for long?

418
00:24:12,560 --> 00:24:13,560
Not long.

419
00:24:14,359 --> 00:24:15,359
Oh, right,

420
00:24:16,886 --> 00:24:19,358
I happen to have two tickets here.

421
00:24:19,640 --> 00:24:21,232
Do you want to go there together?

422
00:24:21,599 --> 00:24:23,320
Why only two tickets? What about me?

423
00:24:23,400 --> 00:24:24,753
Go somewhere else with Su Qian Qian.

424
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:26,553
Let's go. Don't get in the way.

425
00:24:26,880 --> 00:24:27,880
Let's go.

426
00:25:03,400 --> 00:25:05,793
Bravo.

427
00:25:06,439 --> 00:25:08,079
Master! Let's sit here.

428
00:25:12,880 --> 00:25:13,880
Bravo.

429
00:25:17,839 --> 00:25:23,232
Well done.

430
00:25:31,520 --> 00:25:34,072
(I must find a chance today)

431
00:25:34,800 --> 00:25:35,952
(to confess to Chang Yue.)

432
00:25:38,959 --> 00:25:42,072
Wonderful!

433
00:25:45,560 --> 00:25:47,993
There's a rumor saying that I'm into you.

434
00:25:48,160 --> 00:25:50,119
I want to clarify that it's not a rumor.

435
00:25:53,239 --> 00:25:55,232
I realized that I'm into you today.

436
00:25:55,540 --> 00:25:56,613
I'll be into you tomorrow too.

437
00:25:56,825 --> 00:25:58,698
And I'll always be into you.

438
00:25:59,439 --> 00:26:00,712
Isn't that redundant?

439
00:26:06,885 --> 00:26:07,952
- That's the one.   - Hooray!

440
00:26:08,040 --> 00:26:09,352
Bravo.

441
00:26:12,839 --> 00:26:14,321
- Chang Yue.   - Bravo!

442
00:26:14,401 --> 00:26:16,673
I really, really like you a lot.

443
00:26:17,920 --> 00:26:20,359
Awesome! A famous actor makes all the difference.

444
00:26:20,439 --> 00:26:22,753
Qing Qing, you're the best!

445
00:26:22,920 --> 00:26:24,112
Yes!

446
00:26:24,745 --> 00:26:25,745
Great!

447
00:26:26,599 --> 00:26:27,960
- Bravo!   - Qing Qing is awesome!

448
00:26:28,040 --> 00:26:29,040
Qing Qing.

449
00:26:30,079 --> 00:26:31,273
She's so good, isn't she?

450
00:26:32,239 --> 00:26:33,239
Bravo!

451
00:26:33,280 --> 00:26:34,280
Qing Qing!

452
00:26:36,719 --> 00:26:37,873
You're the best!

453
00:26:39,119 --> 00:26:40,232
Qing Qing!

454
00:26:41,479 --> 00:26:43,600
Bravo!

455
00:26:43,680 --> 00:26:44,873
Bravo!

456
00:26:58,760 --> 00:26:59,760
(Su Qian Qian.)

457
00:27:00,079 --> 00:27:01,079
(You sewed this.)

458
00:27:01,280 --> 00:27:02,280
(Just give it to him.)

459
00:27:05,560 --> 00:27:06,560
Xue.

460
00:27:08,479 --> 00:27:09,479
Xue Han Yu!

461
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:11,000
Xue Han Yu!

462
00:27:12,439 --> 00:27:13,439
Xue Han Yu!

463
00:27:14,040 --> 00:27:15,040
Xue Han Yu!

464
00:27:15,199 --> 00:27:16,199
Xue...

465
00:27:19,439 --> 00:27:20,439
Don't step on it.

466
00:27:22,760 --> 00:27:26,793
Whose perfume pouch is this?

467
00:27:26,959 --> 00:27:27,959
Give it back to me.

468
00:27:28,119 --> 00:27:29,119
- No.   - Give it back to me.

469
00:27:29,199 --> 00:27:30,199
No.

470
00:27:32,439 --> 00:27:33,960
Unless you tell me

471
00:27:34,040 --> 00:27:35,359
why you got angry that day

472
00:27:35,439 --> 00:27:36,472
when I gave you the comb.

473
00:27:37,719 --> 00:27:38,259
I...

474
00:27:39,132 --> 00:27:40,446
You wouldn't understand anyway.

475
00:27:40,573 --> 00:27:41,287
You won't tell me?

476
00:27:41,959 --> 00:27:42,959
Then you won't get it back.

477
00:27:43,319 --> 00:27:44,071
Give it back to me.

478
00:27:44,226 --> 00:27:45,267
Give it back.

479
00:27:45,419 --> 00:27:46,111
Give it...

480
00:28:25,099 --> 00:28:26,099
Take it back.

481
00:28:28,211 --> 00:28:29,211
Thank you.

482
00:28:29,358 --> 00:28:30,094
That...

483
00:28:31,199 --> 00:28:33,432
How about we go...

484
00:28:34,132 --> 00:28:35,132
Go see a play.

485
00:28:35,460 --> 00:28:36,973
Great idea!

486
00:28:38,720 --> 00:28:39,952
- My bad.   - Sorry.

487
00:28:41,000 --> 00:28:42,800
This way. Let's go.

488
00:28:42,880 --> 00:28:44,832
- Take care.   - I wish you two happiness.

489
00:28:45,319 --> 00:28:46,319
Thank you.

490
00:28:47,912 --> 00:28:48,455
Mister.

491
00:28:48,895 --> 00:28:50,957
Are you buying a lantern for your loved one?

492
00:28:51,818 --> 00:28:53,254
- Yes.   - Mister.

493
00:28:53,467 --> 00:28:55,673
Just write your wish

494
00:28:55,759 --> 00:28:56,759
on this lantern.

495
00:28:57,045 --> 00:28:58,079
It'll surely come true.

496
00:29:17,560 --> 00:29:18,560
What beautiful calligraphy!

497
00:29:18,719 --> 00:29:19,832
Mister, well written.

498
00:29:23,285 --> 00:29:23,805
Yuan Bao,

499
00:29:24,526 --> 00:29:25,025
wait for me!

500
00:29:30,912 --> 00:29:33,426
(Did he even hear me just now?)

501
00:29:34,613 --> 00:29:35,613
(Never mind.)

502
00:29:36,319 --> 00:29:37,633
(I'll say it again.)

503
00:29:52,880 --> 00:29:53,880
Where's the book?

504
00:30:02,359 --> 00:30:03,553
Forget it.

505
00:30:03,692 --> 00:30:04,318
I'm going all out.

506
00:30:05,359 --> 00:30:06,359
- Chang Yue, I...   - Hush.

507
00:30:15,305 --> 00:30:15,905
Fine.

508
00:30:16,353 --> 00:30:17,353
I'll stay quiet.

509
00:30:17,552 --> 00:30:18,986
If I confess again, I'm an idiot.
