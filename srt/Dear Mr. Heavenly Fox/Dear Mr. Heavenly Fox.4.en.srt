1
00:01:48,922 --> 00:01:53,938
(Dear Mr. Heavenly Fox)

2
00:01:54,019 --> 00:01:57,005
(Episode 4)

3
00:01:58,000 --> 00:01:59,319
Where did the pervert go?

4
00:01:59,400 --> 00:02:00,531
Search this place.

5
00:02:00,639 --> 00:02:02,661
I need to identify the pervert.

6
00:02:02,757 --> 00:02:04,458
- Let's go.   - Let's go.

7
00:02:36,800 --> 00:02:37,826
Are you okay?

8
00:02:40,960 --> 00:02:41,986
This...

9
00:02:42,520 --> 00:02:43,892
What is this place?

10
00:02:44,080 --> 00:02:45,491
How did we get here?

11
00:02:48,080 --> 00:02:49,392
It's a secret chamber.

12
00:02:49,480 --> 00:02:50,682
A secret chamber?

13
00:02:52,328 --> 00:02:53,354
Could it be

14
00:02:53,514 --> 00:02:55,113
the secret chamber that our ancestors

15
00:02:55,241 --> 00:02:56,922
left behind when our sect was founded?

16
00:02:57,279 --> 00:02:58,522
Let's take a look.

17
00:03:11,919 --> 00:03:13,172
Our sect

18
00:03:13,279 --> 00:03:14,762
does have a secret chamber.

19
00:03:15,039 --> 00:03:16,962
I thought it was just a myth.

20
00:03:20,479 --> 00:03:22,242
There are so many treasures here.

21
00:03:22,440 --> 00:03:24,002
It's my first time seeing them.

22
00:03:37,479 --> 00:03:39,002
Obedience Talisman.

23
00:03:39,720 --> 00:03:41,202
(With this,)

24
00:03:41,479 --> 00:03:45,242
(will Father finally tell me the truth about Mother's death?)

25
00:03:51,559 --> 00:03:53,002
Mother's memorial tablet.

26
00:03:57,346 --> 00:03:59,402
Why is my mother's memorial tablet here?

27
00:03:59,945 --> 00:04:01,562
And my maternal grandfather's

28
00:04:01,919 --> 00:04:03,202
and my uncle's memorial tablets.

29
00:04:03,479 --> 00:04:04,922
They're all here.

30
00:04:05,600 --> 00:04:07,131
What exactly is this place?

31
00:04:12,600 --> 00:04:13,771
There's a portrait over there.

32
00:04:18,765 --> 00:04:19,791
Mother.

33
00:04:23,399 --> 00:04:24,400
Mother.

34
00:04:24,534 --> 00:04:25,642
This is my mother.

35
00:04:25,933 --> 00:04:28,082
What do you think? Isn't she beautiful?

36
00:04:37,799 --> 00:04:38,825
Mother.

37
00:04:41,040 --> 00:04:42,066
I...

38
00:04:44,519 --> 00:04:46,082
I miss you dearly.

39
00:05:06,325 --> 00:05:06,958
Careful!

40
00:05:24,519 --> 00:05:25,638
- Are you okay?   - Are you okay?

41
00:05:29,399 --> 00:05:30,400
It seems like

42
00:05:30,480 --> 00:05:32,202
this is the forbidden area of your sect.

43
00:05:35,799 --> 00:05:37,162
It is a trap set by your father.

44
00:05:37,440 --> 00:05:38,466
I guess

45
00:05:38,559 --> 00:05:40,362
it's to protect what's behind it.

46
00:05:41,040 --> 00:05:42,131
Do you still want to go in?

47
00:05:45,799 --> 00:05:47,212
(Could what's behind it)

48
00:05:48,079 --> 00:05:50,305
(be related to my mother's death?)

49
00:06:27,280 --> 00:06:29,482
(Oh, no. Someone trespassed into the forbidden area.)

50
00:06:40,626 --> 00:06:41,962
What is this?

51
00:06:44,971 --> 00:06:45,985
Yuan Bao.

52
00:06:47,559 --> 00:06:48,585
Yuan Bao.

53
00:06:49,760 --> 00:06:51,612
Sleep here

54
00:06:53,359 --> 00:06:55,162
for eternity!

55
00:06:58,519 --> 00:06:59,545
Yuan Bao!

56
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:03,026
Mother.

57
00:07:03,679 --> 00:07:04,405
What's wrong?

58
00:07:07,559 --> 00:07:08,585
I just

59
00:07:09,200 --> 00:07:10,587
saw my mother

60
00:07:11,279 --> 00:07:12,534
and another person,

61
00:07:14,959 --> 00:07:16,858
but I didn't catch what he looked like.

62
00:07:19,479 --> 00:07:20,505
Forget it.

63
00:07:20,640 --> 00:07:22,120
Now is not the time to think about this.

64
00:07:22,200 --> 00:07:23,802
Let's get out of here quickly.

65
00:07:24,320 --> 00:07:25,346
Let's go.

66
00:07:33,200 --> 00:07:33,798
Let's go.

67
00:07:38,760 --> 00:07:39,786
Yuan Bao.

68
00:07:39,920 --> 00:07:40,920
Father.

69
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:42,282
Why are you here?

70
00:07:46,920 --> 00:07:48,840
Yuan Bao, the jade pendant is of no use to you.

71
00:07:48,927 --> 00:07:50,162
Return it to me now.

72
00:07:53,559 --> 00:07:54,882
I can give it back to you.

73
00:07:55,079 --> 00:07:57,691
But tell me what it is.

74
00:07:58,440 --> 00:07:59,466
Also,

75
00:07:59,920 --> 00:08:00,946
Father,

76
00:08:01,079 --> 00:08:03,098
how many things are you hiding from me?

77
00:08:03,559 --> 00:08:05,642
- Mother's death...   - You don't need to know.

78
00:08:09,279 --> 00:08:11,681
Is this jade pendant related to my mother's death?

79
00:08:11,761 --> 00:08:13,122
I'll say it again.

80
00:08:13,203 --> 00:08:14,882
Return the jade pendant to me.

81
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:17,400
- Or you'll be disciplined!   - If you don't tell me the truth today,

82
00:08:17,518 --> 00:08:18,842
I will never give it back.

83
00:08:24,726 --> 00:08:25,545
Will you hand it over or not?

84
00:08:27,079 --> 00:08:28,079
No.

85
00:08:28,159 --> 00:08:29,360
You can kill me if you want.

86
00:08:29,463 --> 00:08:30,882
- You...   - Sect Leader Qi.

87
00:08:32,679 --> 00:08:34,522
A physical wound can heal and be forgotten,

88
00:08:34,746 --> 00:08:36,148
but psychological pain

89
00:08:36,359 --> 00:08:37,762
cannot be healed.

90
00:08:49,159 --> 00:08:50,802
Take Yuan Bao back to Jingsi Cliff.

91
00:08:51,559 --> 00:08:52,585
Noted.

92
00:09:02,679 --> 00:09:03,705
No!

93
00:09:04,239 --> 00:09:05,265
No!

94
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:07,000
No!

95
00:09:07,080 --> 00:09:08,106
Mother!

96
00:09:08,799 --> 00:09:09,825
No!

97
00:09:14,799 --> 00:09:16,292
No!

98
00:09:24,513 --> 00:09:25,192
No!

99
00:09:45,919 --> 00:09:46,945
Mother.

100
00:09:47,640 --> 00:09:49,126
Why did Father

101
00:09:50,320 --> 00:09:52,602
kill you back then?

102
00:09:54,719 --> 00:09:56,442
Did something

103
00:09:57,025 --> 00:09:59,562
that I do not know happened?

104
00:10:05,329 --> 00:10:06,329
(Yu Ying,)

105
00:10:06,410 --> 00:10:09,022
(I promised to shield Yuan Bao)

106
00:10:09,239 --> 00:10:10,882
(from the truth.)

107
00:10:11,119 --> 00:10:12,322
(But you know her personality.)

108
00:10:12,440 --> 00:10:14,042
(Now that she has the Tianji Jade Pendant,)

109
00:10:14,205 --> 00:10:17,297
(I'm afraid I won't be able to hide it for much longer.)

110
00:11:08,239 --> 00:11:09,265
Little fox.

111
00:11:11,039 --> 00:11:12,322
Why are you here?

112
00:11:21,520 --> 00:11:22,882
You know,

113
00:11:25,200 --> 00:11:26,642
when I was little,

114
00:11:27,200 --> 00:11:29,772
Mother always made fennel dumplings

115
00:11:29,919 --> 00:11:31,682
for Father and me.

116
00:11:32,200 --> 00:11:34,399
Back then, we believed

117
00:11:34,525 --> 00:11:36,882
they were the best dumplings in the world.

118
00:11:37,479 --> 00:11:39,562
Father always fought me for them.

119
00:11:39,880 --> 00:11:41,562
He never went easy on me.

120
00:11:42,479 --> 00:11:45,332
That was

121
00:11:45,919 --> 00:11:47,602
the happiest time

122
00:11:47,799 --> 00:11:49,131
of my life.

123
00:11:54,760 --> 00:11:55,811
But now...

124
00:12:06,960 --> 00:12:09,722
Why won't my father tell me anything?

125
00:12:11,159 --> 00:12:14,002
He only has to give me an explanation.

126
00:12:14,479 --> 00:12:15,772
I'll believe him

127
00:12:17,479 --> 00:12:19,012
whatever it is.

128
00:12:33,479 --> 00:12:36,931
Why do you think my father keep everything from me?

129
00:12:49,440 --> 00:12:50,722
(Never mind.)

130
00:12:51,080 --> 00:12:52,482
(I'll let her be today.)

131
00:12:52,749 --> 00:12:54,362
(The in-tandem cultivation can wait.)

132
00:13:05,679 --> 00:13:06,679
Little fox,

133
00:13:06,759 --> 00:13:08,362
did you hurt your leg?

134
00:13:09,280 --> 00:13:10,859
Come. Let me put some ointment on it.

135
00:13:11,919 --> 00:13:13,611
Good thing I brought ointment with me.

136
00:13:13,754 --> 00:13:15,282
(It's just a small injury.)

137
00:13:15,599 --> 00:13:17,122
(Does she need to make such a fuss?)

138
00:13:17,440 --> 00:13:19,562
Come. It might hurt a little.

139
00:13:30,385 --> 00:13:31,411
See?

140
00:13:31,599 --> 00:13:33,602
We're both hurt.

141
00:13:33,799 --> 00:13:36,171
We are in the same boat.

142
00:13:43,760 --> 00:13:45,452
All right.

143
00:13:47,320 --> 00:13:49,452
Done. You'll feel better in a few days.

144
00:13:55,520 --> 00:13:56,571
What are you looking at?

145
00:13:56,960 --> 00:13:58,212
Looking at this?

146
00:13:58,960 --> 00:13:59,986
Don't worry.

147
00:14:00,159 --> 00:14:02,479
This small injury is nothing to me.

148
00:14:02,559 --> 00:14:03,585
See? It doesn't hurt.

149
00:14:06,039 --> 00:14:06,905
(Acting tough.)

150
00:14:09,159 --> 00:14:11,202
Fine. I admit

151
00:14:11,320 --> 00:14:12,562
I'm just being stubborn.

152
00:14:12,709 --> 00:14:14,682
It still hurts a little.

153
00:14:20,840 --> 00:14:21,840
I almost forgot about food.

154
00:14:21,920 --> 00:14:22,946
Wait here.

155
00:14:25,105 --> 00:14:26,945
(Are her dumplings even edible?)

156
00:14:36,559 --> 00:14:38,722
There you go. My delicious dumplings are here.

157
00:14:44,599 --> 00:14:46,082
Enjoy them while they're hot.

158
00:14:48,640 --> 00:14:50,772
Try one for my sake.

159
00:14:53,200 --> 00:14:54,362
(It's uncooked.)

160
00:14:54,462 --> 00:14:56,281
How is it? Delicious?

161
00:14:56,568 --> 00:14:57,594
(Terrible.)

162
00:14:57,719 --> 00:14:58,719
It must be delicious.

163
00:14:58,869 --> 00:15:00,122
I'll try one too.

164
00:15:04,799 --> 00:15:06,362
It's uncooked.

165
00:15:07,080 --> 00:15:08,080
Right.

166
00:15:08,160 --> 00:15:09,892
You're a fox. You like to eat raw meat.

167
00:15:10,640 --> 00:15:11,666
Then,

168
00:15:12,159 --> 00:15:14,442
you can have all these dumplings.

169
00:15:15,119 --> 00:15:16,402
(I don't want them.)

170
00:15:33,520 --> 00:15:34,962
Little fox,

171
00:15:35,799 --> 00:15:38,362
I want to have candied hawthorns.

172
00:15:39,719 --> 00:15:41,522
Didn't you want to eat dumplings?

173
00:15:41,978 --> 00:15:44,162
No, they're awful.

174
00:15:44,719 --> 00:15:48,282
I want to eat flat bread,

175
00:15:48,479 --> 00:15:50,202
grilled lamb kidneys,

176
00:15:50,400 --> 00:15:52,402
grilled large intestines,

177
00:15:52,640 --> 00:15:54,282
grilled pig lungs,

178
00:15:54,400 --> 00:15:56,242
and grilled ox pizzle.

179
00:15:56,599 --> 00:15:58,522
You have weird taste.

180
00:16:09,280 --> 00:16:10,399
Whatever.

181
00:16:11,039 --> 00:16:12,882
Sir, here's your steamed buns.

182
00:16:13,585 --> 00:16:14,842
Thanks, mister.

183
00:16:18,960 --> 00:16:20,442
Dumplings!

184
00:16:20,599 --> 00:16:22,079
Fennel dumplings!

185
00:16:22,206 --> 00:16:25,642
The best fennel dumplings in Beixuan City!

186
00:16:26,561 --> 00:16:28,642
Sir, do you want some fennel dumplings?

187
00:16:55,160 --> 00:16:57,402
Yuan Bao.

188
00:16:57,575 --> 00:16:59,055
Don't sleep here. You'll catch a cold.

189
00:16:59,159 --> 00:17:00,402
Wake up.

190
00:17:00,483 --> 00:17:01,509
Yuan Bao.

191
00:17:04,520 --> 00:17:05,882
Shu Ya.

192
00:17:05,990 --> 00:17:07,201
Why are you sleeping here?

193
00:17:07,439 --> 00:17:08,465
I...

194
00:17:13,800 --> 00:17:14,826
What are you looking for?

195
00:17:16,680 --> 00:17:18,052
Nothing.

196
00:17:18,880 --> 00:17:20,922
Shu Ya, please have a seat.

197
00:17:21,160 --> 00:17:22,186
Okay.

198
00:17:25,927 --> 00:17:27,282
(It seems)

199
00:17:27,680 --> 00:17:29,482
(that the little fox has left.)

200
00:17:32,465 --> 00:17:34,560
By the way, how's your injury? Let me see.

201
00:17:34,641 --> 00:17:36,341
It's nothing. Just a scratch.

202
00:17:36,422 --> 00:17:37,962
I already put ointment on it.

203
00:17:38,177 --> 00:17:39,878
Let me put some more ointment on you

204
00:17:39,959 --> 00:17:41,119
that prevents scarring.

205
00:17:41,317 --> 00:17:43,971
I'm fine. I'm not that fragile.

206
00:17:44,384 --> 00:17:45,410
Nonsense.

207
00:17:47,520 --> 00:17:49,082
It must still hurt a lot.

208
00:18:01,680 --> 00:18:04,812
What did you do today

209
00:18:05,040 --> 00:18:06,411
to make your father so angry?

210
00:18:06,560 --> 00:18:07,724
What else could it be?

211
00:18:07,810 --> 00:18:10,322
It's always the same old thing.

212
00:18:11,560 --> 00:18:13,682
Yuan Bao, take my advice.

213
00:18:14,280 --> 00:18:16,412
Don't be this insubordinate anymore.

214
00:18:17,079 --> 00:18:18,412
Everything your father does

215
00:18:18,520 --> 00:18:19,600
is for your own good.

216
00:18:19,680 --> 00:18:20,879
I know, Shu Ya.

217
00:18:20,959 --> 00:18:22,652
You've told me that eight hundred times.

218
00:18:25,259 --> 00:18:25,778
Okay.

219
00:18:29,146 --> 00:18:30,290
Did you

220
00:18:31,199 --> 00:18:32,316
make these dumplings yourself?

221
00:18:33,119 --> 00:18:35,282
Yes. Why? Are you hungry?

222
00:18:36,737 --> 00:18:39,487
But what I made is awful.

223
00:18:40,484 --> 00:18:42,565
I still have the pastries Tian gave me last time.

224
00:18:42,654 --> 00:18:44,002
Stay here. I'll get them.

225
00:18:44,610 --> 00:18:45,142
No need.

226
00:18:47,346 --> 00:18:50,285
I just want to eat something you made.

227
00:18:57,640 --> 00:18:58,666
Is it good?

228
00:19:02,439 --> 00:19:03,962
Here. Try one too.

229
00:19:07,079 --> 00:19:08,079
What do you think?

230
00:19:08,159 --> 00:19:09,482
It's delicious.

231
00:19:32,599 --> 00:19:33,882
Your Highness,

232
00:19:33,990 --> 00:19:35,322
you're back.

233
00:19:35,959 --> 00:19:37,522
So much good food!

234
00:19:37,603 --> 00:19:38,922
Oh, my!

235
00:19:39,359 --> 00:19:41,362
Did something good happen today?

236
00:19:42,199 --> 00:19:43,200
Your Highness,

237
00:19:43,280 --> 00:19:44,722
candied hawthorns.

238
00:19:46,193 --> 00:19:47,762
And my favorite dumplings!

239
00:19:48,599 --> 00:19:50,042
And pig intestines!

240
00:19:50,199 --> 00:19:52,442
Your Highness, did you buy all this for me?

241
00:19:56,279 --> 00:19:57,280
Your Highness,

242
00:19:57,400 --> 00:19:59,962
- are you okay?   - Throw it away if you don't want to eat it.

243
00:20:01,040 --> 00:20:02,642
I'll dig in then.

244
00:20:03,359 --> 00:20:05,477
Which one should I eat first?

245
00:20:05,603 --> 00:20:06,802
I'll eat you.

246
00:20:09,969 --> 00:20:10,995
Don't...

247
00:20:14,337 --> 00:20:15,425
Don't what?

248
00:20:16,159 --> 00:20:18,819
- Don't burn yourself.   - It's okay, Your Highness. Don't worry.

249
00:20:19,040 --> 00:20:21,082
Your Highness, ever since you came to the mortal realm,

250
00:20:21,163 --> 00:20:23,750
you've become more understanding and reasonable.

251
00:20:23,880 --> 00:20:26,466
Don't worry. I'll finish all this food tonight

252
00:20:26,547 --> 00:20:27,763
and leave nothing behind.

253
00:20:29,040 --> 00:20:30,682
Make sure you don't choke.

254
00:20:33,680 --> 00:20:35,082
It's delicious, Your Highness.

255
00:20:41,280 --> 00:20:42,306
Master,

256
00:20:42,951 --> 00:20:44,963
they had another big fight today.

257
00:20:48,040 --> 00:20:49,242
Why?

258
00:20:49,439 --> 00:20:52,579
Qi Yuan Bao broke into the secret chamber and angered Qi Lian.

259
00:20:52,760 --> 00:20:54,512
They are completely at odds.

260
00:20:55,040 --> 00:20:56,066
It's only a matter of time

261
00:20:56,253 --> 00:20:59,056
before Qi Lian expels Qi Yuan Bao from the sect.

262
00:21:00,183 --> 00:21:02,996
The cultivators are leaving Qishan Sect in groups today.

263
00:21:03,319 --> 00:21:04,840
If we stay,

264
00:21:05,037 --> 00:21:07,122
Qi Lian might grow suspicious.

265
00:21:07,520 --> 00:21:09,275
Then we have to leave as well.

266
00:21:09,400 --> 00:21:11,399
Master, are we going back to Suyun City?

267
00:21:11,525 --> 00:21:13,137
I'll return to Suyun City tomorrow first.

268
00:21:13,719 --> 00:21:16,706
Huo Chen has to go Suiyue Mountain.

269
00:21:17,040 --> 00:21:19,922
Dispatch a squad to follow him.

270
00:21:20,040 --> 00:21:21,642
If he makes any moves,

271
00:21:21,800 --> 00:21:22,882
report to me immediately.

272
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:24,026
Noted.

273
00:21:24,640 --> 00:21:26,746
Then, what about Qi Yuan Bao?

274
00:21:30,119 --> 00:21:31,602
Go to Shen Shen.

275
00:21:32,839 --> 00:21:34,922
After we leave Qishan Sect tomorrow,

276
00:21:35,160 --> 00:21:37,922
have her stay in Beixuan City to keep an eye on Qi Yuan Bao.

277
00:21:38,040 --> 00:21:40,082
If Qi Yuan Bao makes any moves,

278
00:21:40,599 --> 00:21:42,122
ask her to inform you immediately.

279
00:21:42,199 --> 00:21:43,225
Noted.

280
00:21:48,199 --> 00:21:49,682
(Qi Yuan Bao?)

281
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:53,002
(She's just a weakling without a spirit root.)

282
00:21:53,102 --> 00:21:54,865
(Why is Father keeping an eye on her?)

283
00:21:59,049 --> 00:22:00,066
What's on your mind?

284
00:22:02,760 --> 00:22:03,786
Nothing.

285
00:22:04,160 --> 00:22:06,239
Shen Shen, we're going back tomorrow.

286
00:22:06,397 --> 00:22:08,543
This place is so boring. I'm so bored!

287
00:22:09,648 --> 00:22:10,847
You mustn't be so rude.

288
00:22:11,066 --> 00:22:12,919
Sect Leader Qi has been a gracious host.

289
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:14,282
We can't say that.

290
00:22:14,479 --> 00:22:15,042
Well,

291
00:22:15,559 --> 00:22:17,892
I wasn't talking about Sect Leader Qi.

292
00:22:20,760 --> 00:22:21,962
By the way, Qian Qian,

293
00:22:22,174 --> 00:22:24,895
I've decided that I won't return to Suyun City with you.

294
00:22:24,920 --> 00:22:25,766
What?

295
00:22:26,719 --> 00:22:29,812
- Why?   - I think Beixuan City is quite fun.

296
00:22:30,069 --> 00:22:32,162
We came all the way here,

297
00:22:32,560 --> 00:22:34,496
and I haven't seen all the places yet.

298
00:22:34,800 --> 00:22:37,082
So, I've decided to stay a few more days.

299
00:22:37,261 --> 00:22:39,527
I'm planning to go sightseeing.

300
00:22:39,800 --> 00:22:40,811
Sightseeing?

301
00:22:48,760 --> 00:22:52,802
The sightseeing is just an excuse.

302
00:22:53,275 --> 00:22:54,280
You're seeing a man.

303
00:22:54,360 --> 00:22:56,359
What nonsense is this? You're asking for it.

304
00:22:56,462 --> 00:22:58,122
- I...   - Stop!

305
00:23:08,920 --> 00:23:11,451
What exactly is this thing?

306
00:23:13,680 --> 00:23:15,122
Who is that person

307
00:23:15,479 --> 00:23:18,482
I saw in the secret chamber?

308
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:23,251
And what's his relationship with my mother?

309
00:23:25,680 --> 00:23:28,202
And what did

310
00:23:29,199 --> 00:23:30,962
my mother mean back there?

311
00:23:38,680 --> 00:23:41,042
Forget it. I'll stop thinking about it for now.

312
00:23:50,520 --> 00:23:53,242
Why hasn't the little fox come tonight?

313
00:23:53,800 --> 00:23:55,270
Your Highness, aren't you going to be

314
00:23:55,351 --> 00:23:57,082
Young Lady Qi's bodyguard tonight?

315
00:23:59,880 --> 00:24:01,242
I want to ask you something.

316
00:24:01,479 --> 00:24:02,479
Go ahead.

317
00:24:02,559 --> 00:24:04,682
How do we know the in-tandem cultivation is successful?

318
00:24:05,878 --> 00:24:07,878
Your Highness, since you bought me

319
00:24:07,903 --> 00:24:09,179
so much delicious food today,

320
00:24:09,920 --> 00:24:11,282
I'll explain to you.

321
00:24:11,680 --> 00:24:13,932
In-tandem cultivation sounds complicated,

322
00:24:14,119 --> 00:24:16,522
but at its core, it's just about love.

323
00:24:16,800 --> 00:24:17,826
If one day,

324
00:24:17,920 --> 00:24:19,692
her heart skips a beat when she sees you,

325
00:24:19,800 --> 00:24:21,355
she can't help but get close to you,

326
00:24:21,436 --> 00:24:23,442
touch you, and kiss you,

327
00:24:23,680 --> 00:24:26,082
or when she sees you as the only one,

328
00:24:26,199 --> 00:24:28,842
that's when you know she has truly fallen in love with you.

329
00:24:28,920 --> 00:24:31,242
When that happens, the in-tandem cultivation is successful!

330
00:24:41,640 --> 00:24:44,331
Yuan Bao, you should stop making Uncle Qi angry.

331
00:24:44,784 --> 00:24:47,362
Or you'll suffer a lot.

332
00:24:47,680 --> 00:24:50,122
Little fox left yesterday without saying goodbye.

333
00:24:50,435 --> 00:24:52,562
It didn't come to see me last night either.

334
00:24:52,883 --> 00:24:54,614
I wonder if something happened to it.

335
00:24:54,826 --> 00:24:55,852
Yuan Bao,

336
00:24:56,040 --> 00:24:57,442
are you even listening to me?

337
00:25:00,009 --> 00:25:01,947
Yes, I'm listening. Let's go.

338
00:25:04,560 --> 00:25:05,586
Freeze.

339
00:25:11,175 --> 00:25:13,442
What a powerful stasis spell.

340
00:25:14,362 --> 00:25:17,652
He can freeze so many people at the same time.

341
00:25:19,186 --> 00:25:22,572
- If I know this spell,   - Freeze.

342
00:25:22,802 --> 00:25:25,971
leaving the mountain would be a piece of cake.

343
00:25:26,052 --> 00:25:27,078
Freeze.

344
00:25:32,439 --> 00:25:33,465
The lecture is starting.

345
00:25:36,304 --> 00:25:37,762
Yes, Master.

346
00:25:40,280 --> 00:25:41,522
Handsome Master.

347
00:25:41,800 --> 00:25:42,826
Handsome Master.

348
00:25:43,079 --> 00:25:44,362
Handsome Master.

349
00:25:44,893 --> 00:25:46,295
Take one word away.

350
00:25:46,760 --> 00:25:48,002
Handsome?

351
00:25:51,698 --> 00:25:52,698
Master.

352
00:25:52,840 --> 00:25:55,121
We always study what this philosopher said,

353
00:25:55,280 --> 00:25:56,759
what that philosopher said.

354
00:25:56,846 --> 00:25:58,138
- It's so boring.   - So boring.

355
00:25:58,400 --> 00:26:01,172
How about we study something more interesting?

356
00:26:03,176 --> 00:26:03,713
Okay.

357
00:26:04,358 --> 00:26:05,179
What do you want to study?

358
00:26:05,772 --> 00:26:07,451
I just saw you use the stasis spell.

359
00:26:07,532 --> 00:26:08,739
It was truly remarkable.

360
00:26:09,166 --> 00:26:10,998
I experienced it myself yesterday.

361
00:26:11,149 --> 00:26:13,322
Master, please teach me.

362
00:26:20,209 --> 00:26:21,682
Master,

363
00:26:22,079 --> 00:26:24,082
I'm begging you.

364
00:26:24,293 --> 00:26:25,505
Master.

365
00:26:25,719 --> 00:26:27,802
Please.

366
00:26:31,199 --> 00:26:32,692
Please.

367
00:26:34,680 --> 00:26:35,922
You really want to learn it?

368
00:26:36,040 --> 00:26:37,579
Yes, I do.

369
00:26:38,961 --> 00:26:40,442
You are my disciple.

370
00:26:40,795 --> 00:26:42,851
And for once, you're so interested in studying.

371
00:26:44,501 --> 00:26:46,482
I will naturally impart all my knowledge to you.

372
00:26:47,138 --> 00:26:48,164
Great.

373
00:26:48,439 --> 00:26:50,412
Master, please accept my bow.

374
00:26:53,559 --> 00:26:54,852
She yields or stands firm when needed.

375
00:26:54,976 --> 00:26:57,802
She is truly an exemplar of our sect.

376
00:26:57,935 --> 00:26:58,961
Good.

377
