00:01:48,760 --> 00:01:54,026
(Dear Mr. Heavenly Fox)

2
00:01:54,087 --> 00:01:57,014
(Episode 15)

3
00:02:29,720 --> 00:02:31,593
Bravo!

4
00:02:37,919 --> 00:02:39,153
You've said those sweet things

5
00:02:40,479 --> 00:02:41,632
ten times already.

6
00:02:43,240 --> 00:02:44,433
Can you be quiet now?

7
00:03:07,880 --> 00:03:09,472
Selling flowers!

8
00:03:09,960 --> 00:03:11,513
Selling flowers!

9
00:03:11,725 --> 00:03:12,793
Selling flowers!

10
00:03:12,885 --> 00:03:14,118
- Thank you.   - Let's go.

11
00:03:43,039 --> 00:03:44,039
I'm sorry.

12
00:03:46,039 --> 00:03:47,039
Pay for my lantern.

13
00:03:47,240 --> 00:03:48,353
How much? I'll pay you.

14
00:03:49,320 --> 00:03:51,000
- I want this one.   - It's already like this.

15
00:03:51,080 --> 00:03:52,240
You can't restore it. I'll buy...

16
00:03:52,320 --> 00:03:53,880
Pay for my lantern! I want this one!

17
00:03:53,960 --> 00:03:55,793
Are you crazy? How can you use it like this?

18
00:03:57,279 --> 00:03:58,279
Help!

19
00:03:59,279 --> 00:04:00,353
- Why?   - Are you crazy?

20
00:04:01,039 --> 00:04:02,360
I've given you chances again and again,

21
00:04:02,440 --> 00:04:03,953
but you never cherish them.

22
00:04:04,320 --> 00:04:06,280
Instead, you humiliate me again

23
00:04:06,360 --> 00:04:07,679
- and again.   - You're

24
00:04:07,759 --> 00:04:08,759
out of your mind!

25
00:04:08,800 --> 00:04:09,800
Tell me,

26
00:04:10,119 --> 00:04:11,593
what does he have that's better than me?

27
00:04:11,960 --> 00:04:12,960
Tell me!

28
00:04:13,679 --> 00:04:14,920
- Young Master!   - Tell me!

29
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:16,720
- Stop it.   - Tell me!

30
00:04:17,600 --> 00:04:19,160
Young Master, go back to Qishan Sect.

31
00:04:19,519 --> 00:04:20,552
Something happened.

32
00:04:23,767 --> 00:04:24,767
Let's go.

33
00:04:26,119 --> 00:04:27,119
You can't leave!

34
00:04:27,200 --> 00:04:28,433
He hit me.

35
00:04:33,799 --> 00:04:35,879
Look! Other girls have flowers,

36
00:04:35,959 --> 00:04:37,719
- but I don't.   - What?

37
00:04:37,799 --> 00:04:38,912
Yuan Bao doesn't have one either.

38
00:04:39,160 --> 00:04:40,392
Yuan Bao?

39
00:04:40,920 --> 00:04:41,920
Does she even count

40
00:04:42,239 --> 00:04:43,239
as a girl?

41
00:04:44,065 --> 00:04:45,466
What is she if not a girl?

42
00:04:46,200 --> 00:04:47,600
Su Qian Qian, what's your problem?

43
00:04:49,359 --> 00:04:50,792
What do you mean I don't look like a girl?

44
00:04:53,600 --> 00:04:54,759
Other girls are all eager

45
00:04:54,839 --> 00:04:56,232
to receive flowers,

46
00:04:56,480 --> 00:04:58,952
but you're eager to give flowers.

47
00:05:00,839 --> 00:05:01,452
I...

48
00:05:04,720 --> 00:05:06,360
You're asking for a beating.

49
00:05:06,446 --> 00:05:07,968
Look at her.

50
00:05:08,608 --> 00:05:10,027
Don't bump into people. Be careful.

51
00:05:10,799 --> 00:05:11,952
Su Qian Qian.

52
00:05:12,566 --> 00:05:13,182
Stop!

53
00:05:20,839 --> 00:05:21,839
Chang Yue.

54
00:05:34,839 --> 00:05:35,839
Now,

55
00:05:36,600 --> 00:05:37,600
you have flowers too.

56
00:05:50,399 --> 00:05:53,792
Chang Yue, I have something to tell you.

57
00:05:54,720 --> 00:05:55,720
Okay.

58
00:05:56,399 --> 00:05:57,433
Let's go somewhere else.

59
00:05:58,359 --> 00:05:59,359
Where to?

60
00:06:12,399 --> 00:06:14,879
You're just going to take me

61
00:06:14,959 --> 00:06:16,193
to the inn you're staying at?

62
00:06:17,519 --> 00:06:19,519
There are too many people outside. It's not convenient.

63
00:06:20,519 --> 00:06:21,519
Wouldn't that be

64
00:06:21,599 --> 00:06:23,593
a little inappropriate?

65
00:06:24,079 --> 00:06:27,272
Isn't it a little too fast?

66
00:06:28,480 --> 00:06:29,480
You don't like it?

67
00:06:30,119 --> 00:06:32,153
Then how about we go somewhere else?

68
00:06:32,720 --> 00:06:33,720
No need.

69
00:06:33,760 --> 00:06:34,760
I like it a lot.

70
00:06:38,760 --> 00:06:39,760
Then let's go in.

71
00:06:42,200 --> 00:06:43,200
Wait.

72
00:06:44,839 --> 00:06:46,792
Chang Yue, wait here for me.

73
00:06:47,200 --> 00:06:48,232
I'm going to buy something

74
00:06:48,399 --> 00:06:49,399
and I'll be right back.

75
00:06:49,920 --> 00:06:50,920
Buy what?

76
00:06:55,040 --> 00:06:56,112
You'll find out later.

77
00:07:03,119 --> 00:07:04,392
Hurry up and take off your robe.

78
00:07:05,640 --> 00:07:07,840
Forget it. I'll do it. You're clumsy.

79
00:07:07,920 --> 00:07:09,920
Yuan Bao, are you sure about it?

80
00:07:12,160 --> 00:07:13,160
Yuan Bao,

81
00:07:13,472 --> 00:07:14,245
be gentle.

82
00:07:14,720 --> 00:07:15,720
You're hurting me.

83
00:07:17,079 --> 00:07:19,313
I'm sorry. I'm not gentle enough.

84
00:07:19,559 --> 00:07:20,753
I'll be more gentle.

85
00:07:27,079 --> 00:07:28,760
Okay. Done.

86
00:07:34,720 --> 00:07:35,873
What is this?

87
00:07:38,239 --> 00:07:39,239
It's not important.

88
00:07:42,320 --> 00:07:44,672
As expected, beautiful robes for a beautiful person.

89
00:07:45,079 --> 00:07:47,346
The robe looks best on my master.

90
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:50,392
You rushed out just now

91
00:07:50,679 --> 00:07:51,832
to buy this for me?

92
00:07:52,160 --> 00:07:53,160
Yes.

93
00:07:53,399 --> 00:07:55,999
Actually, I wanted to give you

94
00:07:56,079 --> 00:07:57,352
that robe last time.

95
00:07:57,600 --> 00:08:00,153
But Xue Han Yu took it and gave it to Shu Ya.

96
00:08:00,519 --> 00:08:01,873
Xue Han Yu is so stupid.

97
00:08:02,720 --> 00:08:03,832
It was originally meant for me?

98
00:08:04,440 --> 00:08:06,433
Why would I give a robe to Shu Ya?

99
00:08:06,519 --> 00:08:07,593
It's such an intimate gift.

100
00:08:12,799 --> 00:08:13,932
I mean,

101
00:08:14,842 --> 00:08:15,919
that robe

102
00:08:16,720 --> 00:08:18,272
clearly looks good on you.

103
00:08:18,760 --> 00:08:20,512
Weren't you going to tell me something?

104
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:23,153
This is what I wanted to tell you.

105
00:08:24,559 --> 00:08:25,993
Also,

106
00:08:29,040 --> 00:08:29,852
Chang Yue,

107
00:08:30,920 --> 00:08:32,433
this year's Qiqiao Festival

108
00:08:32,880 --> 00:08:34,712
was the happiest I've ever been.

109
00:08:35,760 --> 00:08:36,760
Me too.

110
00:08:37,119 --> 00:08:38,360
Can we spend next year's

111
00:08:38,440 --> 00:08:39,672
Qiqiao Festival together too?

112
00:08:46,359 --> 00:08:47,359
Sure.

113
00:08:53,280 --> 00:08:54,280
Chang Yue,

114
00:08:54,440 --> 00:08:57,032
I really like you.

115
00:08:57,320 --> 00:08:59,912
Qing Qing, you're the best.

116
00:09:00,919 --> 00:09:02,393
(Despite knowing your are unfathomable,)

117
00:09:03,599 --> 00:09:05,193
(I still can't help but trust you.)

118
00:09:09,486 --> 00:09:10,292
Father,

119
00:09:11,111 --> 00:09:11,711
come.

120
00:09:17,039 --> 00:09:18,039
These fox demons

121
00:09:18,320 --> 00:09:19,320
have the audacity

122
00:09:19,400 --> 00:09:20,400
to cause trouble.

123
00:09:20,799 --> 00:09:21,799
They deserve to be killed.

124
00:09:22,880 --> 00:09:24,433
Yes, fox demons deserve to be killed.

125
00:09:25,440 --> 00:09:26,440
Huo,

126
00:09:26,679 --> 00:09:28,719
I heard that in Qishan Sect,

127
00:09:28,799 --> 00:09:30,073
a fox demon has appeared.

128
00:09:30,840 --> 00:09:32,633
And it's very close to Yuan Bao.

129
00:09:33,159 --> 00:09:34,273
Is that so?

130
00:09:34,679 --> 00:09:36,672
These fox demons are very cunning and cruel.

131
00:09:36,799 --> 00:09:38,232
They can bewitch people's hearts.

132
00:09:38,400 --> 00:09:39,400
Shu Ya,

133
00:09:40,159 --> 00:09:42,152
you and Yuan Bao have always been close.

134
00:09:42,599 --> 00:09:44,232
You should protect Yuan Bao

135
00:09:44,559 --> 00:09:46,592
in case Yuan Bao is bewitched by this fox demon

136
00:09:46,760 --> 00:09:47,833
and loses her mind.

137
00:09:51,280 --> 00:09:53,753
Master, are we still going to make a move on Huo Chen tonight?

138
00:09:54,679 --> 00:09:55,679
No need.

139
00:09:55,919 --> 00:09:57,159
What if he tells everyone about

140
00:09:57,257 --> 00:09:58,257
the Corpse Puppet King?

141
00:10:00,893 --> 00:10:02,326
Huo Chen didn't mention a word.

142
00:10:03,039 --> 00:10:04,552
about the Corpse Puppet King.

143
00:10:05,479 --> 00:10:06,959
Could it be that he also wants to obtain

144
00:10:07,039 --> 00:10:08,039
its spiritual power?

145
00:10:10,440 --> 00:10:12,112
People are all greedy,

146
00:10:12,239 --> 00:10:13,513
and Huo Chen is no exception.

147
00:10:14,305 --> 00:10:15,305
But

148
00:10:16,320 --> 00:10:17,873
Chang Yue saved Huo Chen that day.

149
00:10:18,320 --> 00:10:19,552
With Huo Chen as a witness,

150
00:10:19,760 --> 00:10:21,592
I'm afraid we can't pin the cultivator's death

151
00:10:21,760 --> 00:10:23,232
on Chang Yue.

152
00:10:24,239 --> 00:10:25,993
Even if I don't start this feud,

153
00:10:26,320 --> 00:10:28,032
someone will help me start it.

154
00:10:30,479 --> 00:10:30,966
Father,

155
00:10:31,575 --> 00:10:33,255
did you see what the fox demon that hurt you

156
00:10:33,280 --> 00:10:34,112
looked like?

157
00:10:34,520 --> 00:10:36,513
He was wearing a mask so I couldn't see clearly.

158
00:10:37,200 --> 00:10:38,352
But I made another discovery

159
00:10:38,520 --> 00:10:39,592
in Suiyue Mountain.

160
00:10:40,200 --> 00:10:41,200
What discovery?

161
00:10:42,520 --> 00:10:43,520
Shu Ya,

162
00:10:44,919 --> 00:10:46,552
have you heard of the Corpse Puppet King?

163
00:10:47,960 --> 00:10:48,960
Are you talking about

164
00:10:49,080 --> 00:10:50,920
the Corpse Puppet King who appeared

165
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:52,633
a thousand years ago and wreaked havoc?

166
00:10:54,080 --> 00:10:55,672
Isn't that just a legend among cultivators?

167
00:10:56,840 --> 00:10:57,953
I was in Suiyue Mountain.

168
00:10:58,200 --> 00:11:00,112
I discovered the sealed Corpse Puppet King.

169
00:11:00,880 --> 00:11:03,240
So, the spirit particle did sacrifice herself

170
00:11:03,320 --> 00:11:04,912
to seal the Corpse Puppet King.

171
00:11:05,640 --> 00:11:07,520
I was just trying to figure out what was going on

172
00:11:08,559 --> 00:11:09,792
when the fox demon appeared.

173
00:11:10,039 --> 00:11:11,320
His methods were extremely ruthless,

174
00:11:11,400 --> 00:11:13,193
and all the cultivators died at his hands.

175
00:11:13,799 --> 00:11:14,800
If Mr. Chang Yue

176
00:11:14,880 --> 00:11:15,953
hadn't saved my life,

177
00:11:18,080 --> 00:11:20,273
you probably wouldn't have been able to see me again.

178
00:11:22,760 --> 00:11:24,273
You said Chang Yue saved you?

179
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:26,000
Yes.

180
00:11:28,119 --> 00:11:29,119
Father,

181
00:11:29,640 --> 00:11:31,240
do you know that Chang Yue is the fox demon

182
00:11:31,320 --> 00:11:32,320
who approached Yuan Bao?

183
00:11:32,520 --> 00:11:33,520
What?

184
00:11:33,559 --> 00:11:34,792
Chang Yue is a fox demon?

185
00:11:34,899 --> 00:11:35,899
How is that possible?

186
00:11:36,640 --> 00:11:37,993
I saw it with my own eyes.

187
00:11:39,559 --> 00:11:40,559
In any case,

188
00:11:41,239 --> 00:11:43,232
Mr. Chang Yue did save my life.

189
00:11:43,880 --> 00:11:44,880
When I see him next time,

190
00:11:46,479 --> 00:11:47,993
I will thank him properly.

191
00:11:56,359 --> 00:11:57,712
Why are you guys walking so slowly?

192
00:11:58,640 --> 00:11:59,640
Qi Yuan Bao,

193
00:11:59,760 --> 00:12:01,120
you spent a long time with Chang Yue

194
00:12:01,200 --> 00:12:02,472
at the inn yesterday.

195
00:12:03,039 --> 00:12:04,039
When he walked you out,

196
00:12:04,119 --> 00:12:05,152
he even changed his clothes.

197
00:12:05,840 --> 00:12:07,193
What were you two doing?

198
00:12:08,039 --> 00:12:09,039
You want to know?

199
00:12:10,479 --> 00:12:11,479
I'm not telling you.

200
00:12:13,880 --> 00:12:15,399
You two were arguing all night,

201
00:12:15,479 --> 00:12:16,552
and you're still bickering now.

202
00:12:16,679 --> 00:12:17,993
I'm at a loss for words.

203
00:12:19,159 --> 00:12:20,159
Yuan Bao.

204
00:12:20,200 --> 00:12:22,079
Yuan Bao, you're finally back.

205
00:12:22,159 --> 00:12:23,313
We were just about to go find you.

206
00:12:23,599 --> 00:12:25,360
Me? What's the matter?

207
00:12:25,440 --> 00:12:26,592
Master told us to find you.

208
00:12:26,880 --> 00:12:28,520
We don't know exactly what happened.

209
00:12:28,600 --> 00:12:29,719
You'll find out in the main hall.

210
00:12:29,799 --> 00:12:31,159
Yes, you'll find out in the main hall.

211
00:12:41,919 --> 00:12:42,919
Father.

212
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:44,000
This is…

213
00:12:44,479 --> 00:12:45,833
Qian Qian, come over here.

214
00:12:47,479 --> 00:12:48,672
What exactly is going on?

215
00:12:52,679 --> 00:12:53,679
Over a month ago,

216
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:55,000
we, the Yue Lu Sect,

217
00:12:55,359 --> 00:12:56,359
along with other cultivators,

218
00:12:56,400 --> 00:12:57,873
went to investigate Suiyue Mountain.

219
00:12:58,479 --> 00:13:00,440
Unexpectedly, we encountered a fox demon.

220
00:13:00,719 --> 00:13:02,193
The fox demon was cunning and cruel.

221
00:13:02,479 --> 00:13:04,352
Not only did he kill all the other cultivators,

222
00:13:04,840 --> 00:13:05,953
but even our master was...

223
00:13:08,799 --> 00:13:09,993
The fox demon killed people?

224
00:13:12,359 --> 00:13:13,359
Sect Leader Qi,

225
00:13:13,400 --> 00:13:14,552
this is a serious matter.

226
00:13:14,799 --> 00:13:15,873
Please help us

227
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:17,000
kill the fox demon!

228
00:13:18,200 --> 00:13:20,210
Sect Leader Qi, please help us

229
00:13:20,320 --> 00:13:21,513
Kill the fox demon!

230
00:13:21,840 --> 00:13:22,912
Everyone, please get up.

231
00:13:25,559 --> 00:13:27,152
Even though all the cultivators died,

232
00:13:27,479 --> 00:13:28,513
that doesn't necessarily mean

233
00:13:28,599 --> 00:13:29,993
the fox demon killed them.

234
00:13:49,200 --> 00:13:52,073
This wound is greenish-blue,

235
00:13:52,320 --> 00:13:53,320
exuding a fox aura.

236
00:13:53,520 --> 00:13:54,599
It's clearly the work

237
00:13:54,679 --> 00:13:55,792
of Phantom Fox Dart.

238
00:14:01,880 --> 00:14:02,880
Yuan Bao,

239
00:14:03,159 --> 00:14:04,159
tell me.

240
00:14:04,200 --> 00:14:05,360
On the day of the banquet,

241
00:14:05,440 --> 00:14:06,440
everyone saw a fox demon.

242
00:14:06,840 --> 00:14:08,193
Then, Chang Yue suddenly disappeared.

243
00:14:08,960 --> 00:14:09,960
Is the fox demon

244
00:14:11,159 --> 00:14:12,633
perhaps Chang Yue?

245
00:14:20,919 --> 00:14:22,433
Chang Yue is actually a fox demon?

246
00:14:23,840 --> 00:14:24,840
No way.

247
00:14:24,919 --> 00:14:26,953
Mr. Chang Yue doesn't seem like a fox demon.

248
00:14:27,239 --> 00:14:28,639
Exactly. Mr. Huo,

249
00:14:28,719 --> 00:14:30,032
don't accuse without evidence.

250
00:14:30,559 --> 00:14:31,760
Sect Leader Qi brought a fox demon

251
00:14:31,840 --> 00:14:32,993
into Qishan Sect?

252
00:14:33,559 --> 00:14:35,880
That fox demon seems to have a close relationship

253
00:14:35,960 --> 00:14:36,960
with Young Lady Qi.

254
00:14:37,679 --> 00:14:39,073
Are they colluding?

255
00:14:39,359 --> 00:14:40,359
In my opinion,

256
00:14:40,719 --> 00:14:41,912
Not only is Chang Yue a fox demon,

257
00:14:43,280 --> 00:14:44,839
but he was also the one who killed our peers.

258
00:14:44,919 --> 00:14:45,919
You're making things up.

259
00:14:45,960 --> 00:14:46,960
Yuan Bao,

260
00:14:47,520 --> 00:14:49,633
you know better than anyone whether this is true or not.

261
00:14:53,119 --> 00:14:54,119
I'll ask you again.

262
00:14:54,640 --> 00:14:55,640
Some time ago,

263
00:14:56,119 --> 00:14:58,393
when cultivators were killed on Suiyue Mountain,

264
00:14:58,851 --> 00:15:00,313
was Chang Yue missing?

265
00:15:01,400 --> 00:15:02,400
Did you ask him

266
00:15:02,679 --> 00:15:03,800
where he went?

267
00:15:03,880 --> 00:15:04,880
What did he do?

268
00:15:06,080 --> 00:15:07,912
That fox was covered in injuries.

269
00:15:08,919 --> 00:15:12,080
Did you ever ask him how he got those injuries?

270
00:15:15,599 --> 00:15:16,672
I remember

271
00:15:17,039 --> 00:15:18,912
you were seriously injured.

272
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:21,393
How did you get those injuries?

273
00:15:24,239 --> 00:15:25,239
You can't tell me?

274
00:15:26,880 --> 00:15:27,953
It was an accident.

275
00:15:39,440 --> 00:15:40,440
Impossible.

276
00:15:40,760 --> 00:15:41,792
Shu Ya,

277
00:15:42,200 --> 00:15:43,441
These are just

278
00:15:43,521 --> 00:15:44,912
your baseless speculations.

279
00:15:45,760 --> 00:15:47,032
Even if a fox demon killed the people,

280
00:15:47,280 --> 00:15:48,873
it doesn't mean Chang Yue did it.

281
00:15:49,119 --> 00:15:50,273
Chang Yue isn't like this..

282
00:15:50,479 --> 00:15:52,279
Exactly. Mr. Chang Yue is definitely not

283
00:15:52,359 --> 00:15:54,313
the kind of indiscriminate killer you're talking about.

284
00:15:54,679 --> 00:15:55,833
I think so too.

285
00:15:56,640 --> 00:15:57,640
Qian Qian,

286
00:15:58,200 --> 00:15:59,592
don't meddle in adult business.

287
00:16:00,880 --> 00:16:02,799
If you want to convince me he's the killer,

288
00:16:02,960 --> 00:16:04,433
then bring solid evidence.

289
00:16:04,880 --> 00:16:06,993
If you're just making up stories to frame innocent people,

290
00:16:07,479 --> 00:16:08,753
I will not entertain you.

291
00:16:08,840 --> 00:16:09,912
I will despise you.

292
00:16:14,280 --> 00:16:15,633
Yuan Bao is right.

293
00:16:17,119 --> 00:16:18,119
Huo?

294
00:16:20,239 --> 00:16:21,552
Yuan Bao is right.

295
00:16:31,799 --> 00:16:32,799
Huo.

296
00:16:35,280 --> 00:16:36,912
As a righteous sect,

297
00:16:37,359 --> 00:16:39,152
we must not wrongly accuse any innocent person.

298
00:16:39,559 --> 00:16:40,953
Especially since it's a serious matter.

299
00:16:41,840 --> 00:16:42,840
Mr. Huo,

300
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:44,352
were you rescued by someone?

301
00:16:45,119 --> 00:16:45,725
Yes.

302
00:16:46,679 --> 00:16:50,073
I was fortunate to have the help of a kind person that day,

303
00:16:50,640 --> 00:16:52,433
and was able to escape from the fox demon

304
00:16:53,440 --> 00:16:54,672
alive.

305
00:16:55,253 --> 00:16:55,843
Huo,

306
00:16:56,520 --> 00:16:58,032
you are the only survivor of this incident.

307
00:16:58,559 --> 00:16:59,559
Tell us.

308
00:16:59,599 --> 00:17:00,599
Who attacked you?

309
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:02,592
And was Chang Yue among them?

310
00:17:21,160 --> 00:17:22,160
Yes.

311
00:17:23,479 --> 00:17:26,273
That day, I saw with my own eyes

312
00:17:34,800 --> 00:17:37,553
that Chang Yue

313
00:17:38,079 --> 00:17:39,472
cruelly slaughtered everyone.

314
00:17:43,599 --> 00:17:44,599
Impossible!

315
00:17:47,632 --> 00:17:48,632
This is impossible.

316
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:50,000
Huo,

317
00:17:50,280 --> 00:17:51,280
did you see clearly?

318
00:17:51,959 --> 00:17:53,039
This is serious.

319
00:17:53,119 --> 00:17:54,673
And we must not wrongly accuse anyone.

320
00:17:55,800 --> 00:17:56,800
I

321
00:17:57,280 --> 00:17:58,394
would never lie.

322
00:18:06,040 --> 00:18:07,040
Qi.

323
00:18:10,479 --> 00:18:11,952
You have known Huo for many years.

324
00:18:12,160 --> 00:18:13,160
Do you still doubt

325
00:18:13,640 --> 00:18:14,793
his character?

326
00:18:15,760 --> 00:18:16,832
I can't believe

327
00:18:17,400 --> 00:18:20,033
Young Lady Qi brought an enemy here.

328
00:18:20,479 --> 00:18:21,479
Back then,

329
00:18:21,680 --> 00:18:23,442
you and Chang Yue were always together.

330
00:18:23,680 --> 00:18:26,119
How could you not know about this?

331
00:18:26,439 --> 00:18:27,472
Don't make things up.

332
00:18:28,907 --> 00:18:30,979
To condemn someone, one can always trump up a charge.

333
00:18:31,800 --> 00:18:32,800
Mr. Huo,

334
00:18:33,079 --> 00:18:34,079
your lone statement

335
00:18:34,159 --> 00:18:35,312
may convince others,

336
00:18:35,560 --> 00:18:36,592
but it cannot convince me.

337
00:18:38,079 --> 00:18:40,952
If it were just my word against his,

338
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:43,393
I wouldn't dare to make this accusation.

339
00:18:44,599 --> 00:18:46,112
I have another piece of evidence here.

340
00:18:51,079 --> 00:18:52,079
This is...

341
00:18:59,640 --> 00:19:02,273
This is what I snatched from one of the murderers

342
00:19:02,959 --> 00:19:04,913
when they weren't paying attention that day.

343
00:19:05,467 --> 00:19:06,467
Yuan Bao.

344
00:19:07,880 --> 00:19:08,880
Do you recognize this?

345
00:19:35,520 --> 00:19:36,520
Yuan Bao,

346
00:19:37,160 --> 00:19:38,352
it's Hu Bu Lin's fan.

347
00:19:39,839 --> 00:19:40,879
It seems

348
00:19:40,959 --> 00:19:42,472
the murderer and Chang Yue

349
00:19:42,880 --> 00:19:44,432
are inextricably linked.

350
00:19:44,680 --> 00:19:45,680
Impossible!

351
00:19:46,079 --> 00:19:47,079
Chang Yue

352
00:19:47,479 --> 00:19:48,753
isn't that kind of person.

353
00:19:49,079 --> 00:19:50,079
Yuan Bao,

354
00:19:50,479 --> 00:19:52,072
why are you still defending him?

355
00:19:53,920 --> 00:19:56,232
For hundreds of years, the fox clan has been a scourge to humanity.

356
00:19:56,520 --> 00:19:58,432
Cultivators did everything

357
00:19:58,520 --> 00:19:59,832
to drive them to Beiming.

358
00:20:00,760 --> 00:20:01,993
They won't admit defeat like this.

359
00:20:02,959 --> 00:20:03,959
It seems

360
00:20:04,760 --> 00:20:06,553
Chang Yue's killing

361
00:20:06,959 --> 00:20:08,072
was carefully planned.

362
00:20:08,599 --> 00:20:10,280
That's right. This must be the truth.

363
00:20:10,400 --> 00:20:11,560
We must kill Chang Yue!

364
00:20:11,640 --> 00:20:13,279
- Yes, kill Chang Yue!   - Everyone, calm down.

365
00:20:13,359 --> 00:20:14,359
Kill Chang Yue!

366
00:20:18,560 --> 00:20:19,560
There's one more thing

367
00:20:20,239 --> 00:20:21,673
I don't know if I should say.

368
00:20:22,319 --> 00:20:24,072
Su, things have come to this,

369
00:20:24,479 --> 00:20:25,873
what else can't you mention?

370
00:20:29,520 --> 00:20:30,520
Yuan Bao,

371
00:20:31,359 --> 00:20:32,480
you're a loyal and righteous

372
00:20:32,560 --> 00:20:33,560
child,

373
00:20:33,880 --> 00:20:34,880
But this time,

374
00:20:35,040 --> 00:20:36,553
I'm afraid you've misjudged someone.

375
00:20:37,280 --> 00:20:38,592
Chang Yue approached you

376
00:20:39,280 --> 00:20:40,673
with ulterior motives.

377
00:20:42,839 --> 00:20:43,498
Su,

378
00:20:44,359 --> 00:20:45,673
you cannot tell her about it.

379
00:20:46,640 --> 00:20:48,633
Father, what is it?

380
00:20:49,079 --> 00:20:50,920
Do you still have something to hide from me?

381
00:20:55,040 --> 00:20:56,633
Since Qi doesn't want to talk about it,

382
00:20:57,479 --> 00:20:59,072
then I'll pretend I don't know.

383
00:20:59,939 --> 00:21:00,513
Father!

384
00:21:04,560 --> 00:21:05,560
Mr. Su,

385
00:21:05,959 --> 00:21:07,153
please tell me.

386
00:21:17,280 --> 00:21:19,720
It's rumored that the fox clan hasn't seen

387
00:21:19,800 --> 00:21:21,673
a Red-Tailed Silver Fox in a hundred years.

388
00:21:22,599 --> 00:21:23,599
But a hundred years ago,

389
00:21:23,640 --> 00:21:25,033
a Red-Tailed Silver Fox appeared.

390
00:21:25,400 --> 00:21:27,680
The Red-Tailed Silver Fox must undergo a hundred years of training

391
00:21:27,760 --> 00:21:30,153
to become a Heavenly Fox.

392
00:21:30,599 --> 00:21:31,599
Once he did that,

393
00:21:31,640 --> 00:21:33,560
the fox clan's spiritual power will greatly increase,

394
00:21:33,640 --> 00:21:34,712
consolidating the barrier.

395
00:21:34,920 --> 00:21:36,712
Invading the mortal realm

396
00:21:36,880 --> 00:21:38,232
will be next.

397
00:21:39,319 --> 00:21:40,952
But what does this have to do with Chang Yue?

398
00:21:41,719 --> 00:21:43,432
If I'm not wrong,

399
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:45,000
Chang Yue

400
00:21:47,119 --> 00:21:49,192
is the Red-Tailed Silver Fox.

401
00:21:53,719 --> 00:21:54,719
What makes you think that?

402
00:21:56,359 --> 00:21:58,033
The Red-Tailed Silver Fox is unable to ascend

403
00:21:58,119 --> 00:21:59,432
after a hundred years

404
00:21:59,599 --> 00:22:01,759
because a wisp of his soul

405
00:22:01,839 --> 00:22:02,993
is in the mortal realm.

406
00:22:04,680 --> 00:22:05,680
Yuan Bao,

407
00:22:06,880 --> 00:22:08,312
this wisp of his soul

408
00:22:11,560 --> 00:22:13,633
is now in your body.

409
00:22:19,520 --> 00:22:20,520
Impossible.

410
00:22:20,719 --> 00:22:22,273
I've never heard of this soul.

411
00:22:24,880 --> 00:22:26,800
Yuan Bao, years ago,

412
00:22:27,160 --> 00:22:28,800
your father severed your spirit root.

413
00:22:28,880 --> 00:22:29,880
That's a fact.

414
00:22:30,599 --> 00:22:31,599
Months ago,

415
00:22:31,719 --> 00:22:32,960
your spirit root suddenly recovered,

416
00:22:33,040 --> 00:22:34,720
and your spiritual power greatly increased.

417
00:22:34,800 --> 00:22:36,759
The reason for this oddity

418
00:22:36,839 --> 00:22:38,192
is because there's a wisp of his soul

419
00:22:39,680 --> 00:22:41,273
in your body.

420
00:22:51,719 --> 00:22:54,273
If it's really as you say,

421
00:22:55,239 --> 00:22:56,239
he has had many opportunities

422
00:22:56,319 --> 00:22:58,280
to take the soul away. Why didn't he take it?

423
00:22:58,360 --> 00:22:59,472
He can't take it out.

424
00:23:02,479 --> 00:23:03,673
He must use in-tandem cultivation

425
00:23:04,640 --> 00:23:06,553
to merge with you.

426
00:23:06,719 --> 00:23:08,600
Simply put, he bewitches you,

427
00:23:08,680 --> 00:23:10,952
seduces you until you fall in love with him.

428
00:23:11,199 --> 00:23:12,199
Then the soul

429
00:23:12,279 --> 00:23:13,680
will recognize him as its master again,

430
00:23:13,760 --> 00:23:15,513
and he can easily take it.

431
00:23:24,359 --> 00:23:25,359
So

432
00:23:25,839 --> 00:23:27,472
the fox demon doesn't love Yuan Bao at all.

433
00:23:27,938 --> 00:23:29,393
He approached Yuan Bao with a purpose.

434
00:23:29,760 --> 00:23:31,472
Becoming Yuan Bao's tutor

435
00:23:32,119 --> 00:23:33,393
was all part of his plan.

436
00:23:35,079 --> 00:23:36,079
Impossible!

437
00:23:36,839 --> 00:23:37,913
This is impossible!

438
00:23:39,280 --> 00:23:40,280
Impossible!

439
00:23:41,520 --> 00:23:42,993
Yuan Bao, look at me.

440
00:23:43,319 --> 00:23:44,319
Think carefully.

441
00:23:44,560 --> 00:23:46,072
Did he have ulterior motives?

442
00:23:46,599 --> 00:23:47,673
You've known him for so long.

443
00:23:47,920 --> 00:23:49,880
Doesn't he have even the slightest suspicious behavior?

444
00:23:56,959 --> 00:23:57,959
Mister,

445
00:23:58,039 --> 00:23:59,112
it's you again.

446
00:24:05,079 --> 00:24:06,673
Hu Bu Lin, attack!

447
00:24:11,719 --> 00:24:13,753
Yuan Bao, if he takes the soul,

448
00:24:14,280 --> 00:24:15,832
he's going to attack all mortals.

449
00:24:18,006 --> 00:24:19,006
When that happens,

450
00:24:19,560 --> 00:24:20,560
our loss

451
00:24:21,079 --> 00:24:22,712
won't just be a few lives.

452
00:24:23,800 --> 00:24:24,832
Don't you understand?

453
00:24:27,880 --> 00:24:28,880
He

454
00:24:30,266 --> 00:24:32,298
truly came to take the soul.

455
00:24:35,119 --> 00:24:36,873
He never loved me.

456
00:24:38,839 --> 00:24:40,072
He never

457
00:24:41,520 --> 00:24:42,952
loved me.

458
00:24:43,640 --> 00:24:45,159
Name your conditions.

459
00:24:45,239 --> 00:24:46,393
I can fulfill them.

460
00:24:47,079 --> 00:24:48,079
(Kiss me.)

461
00:24:52,800 --> 00:24:54,273
(I left something here.)

462
00:24:54,560 --> 00:24:55,753
Did you find it?

463
00:24:57,178 --> 00:24:58,178
Almost.

464
00:25:01,040 --> 00:25:02,880
- Yuan Bao!   - Yuan Bao!

465
00:25:03,319 --> 00:25:05,033
- Yuan Bao!   - Yuan Bao!

466
00:25:23,040 --> 00:25:24,472
You've all worked hard.

467
00:25:24,800 --> 00:25:25,952
Go back and rest first.

468
00:25:26,560 --> 00:25:27,560
I'm here for Yuan Bao.

469
00:25:28,479 --> 00:25:29,479
Mr. Qi.

470
00:25:29,559 --> 00:25:30,873
I'll come see Yuan Bao tomorrow.

471
00:25:41,760 --> 00:25:43,399
I thought Mr. Chang Yue

472
00:25:43,479 --> 00:25:45,312
was a sincere and righteous person.

473
00:25:46,199 --> 00:25:47,199
I can't believe

474
00:25:47,400 --> 00:25:49,472
that he actually killed so many cultivators.

475
00:25:49,640 --> 00:25:51,592
He even hurt Qi Yuan Bao like this.

476
00:25:52,920 --> 00:25:53,920
Where are you going?

477
00:25:54,199 --> 00:25:55,472
I'm settling the score with Chang Yue.

478
00:25:55,920 --> 00:25:57,153
Settle the score with him?

479
00:25:57,640 --> 00:25:58,712
He's a fox demon!

480
00:25:58,800 --> 00:26:00,033
Settle the score with him?

481
00:26:00,199 --> 00:26:01,393
Do you have a death wish?

482
00:26:01,719 --> 00:26:03,472
Yuan Bao was devoted to him.

483
00:26:03,959 --> 00:26:05,520
In all these years, I've never seen her

484
00:26:05,545 --> 00:26:06,897
do so many things to please someone.

485
00:26:07,920 --> 00:26:09,033
She bought him flowers,

486
00:26:09,280 --> 00:26:10,472
made him happy,

487
00:26:10,560 --> 00:26:12,033
and dressed up for him.

488
00:26:12,359 --> 00:26:14,513
As a girl, isn't Yuan Bao good enough for him?

489
00:26:14,760 --> 00:26:16,112
But he deceived her.

490
00:26:16,445 --> 00:26:18,100
I must go find him today and get some answers.

491
00:26:19,199 --> 00:26:19,947
Xue Han Yu!

492
00:26:20,093 --> 00:26:21,336
- Xue Han Yu!   - What?

493
00:26:29,000 --> 00:26:30,712
What have they been feeding you?

494
00:26:31,305 --> 00:26:31,891
You're so heavy.

495
00:26:33,920 --> 00:26:35,592
I know you're worried about Yuan Bao.

496
00:26:35,920 --> 00:26:37,432
But I'm doing this for your own good.

497
00:26:37,839 --> 00:26:39,033
Don't be mad

498
00:26:39,119 --> 00:26:40,312
when you wake up.

499
00:26:56,833 --> 00:26:57,833
Idiot.

500
00:26:58,119 --> 00:26:59,119
Loving you is tiring.

501
00:27:15,680 --> 00:27:17,592
- Father.   - How is Yuan Bao?

502
00:27:18,599 --> 00:27:19,599
She's fine.

503
00:27:19,959 --> 00:27:20,959
She was shocked

504
00:27:21,239 --> 00:27:22,239
and fainted.

505
00:27:22,280 --> 00:27:23,432
I did this

506
00:27:23,640 --> 00:27:25,192
for you.

507
00:27:26,680 --> 00:27:28,352
Shu Ya, what are you doing?

508
00:27:28,760 --> 00:27:29,760
Father.

509
00:27:30,119 --> 00:27:31,513
I have a request.

510
00:27:33,959 --> 00:27:35,432
Later in the main hall,

511
00:27:36,160 --> 00:27:37,480
please identify Chang Yue

512
00:27:37,560 --> 00:27:39,832
as the murderer who killed all the cultivators.

513
00:27:40,119 --> 00:27:41,119
What?

514
00:27:41,239 --> 00:27:42,239
Do you know what you're doing?

515
00:27:42,319 --> 00:27:43,513
I know what I'm doing, Father.

516
00:27:44,439 --> 00:27:45,439
Father,

517
00:27:45,640 --> 00:27:46,993
Chang Yue is a fox demon.

518
00:27:47,640 --> 00:27:49,072
He appeared at an odd time.

519
00:27:49,439 --> 00:27:50,720
Yuan Bao is bewitched by him

520
00:27:50,800 --> 00:27:51,873
and is close to him.

521
00:27:52,719 --> 00:27:54,560
If we don't put all the blame on Chang Yue

522
00:27:54,640 --> 00:27:55,640
to wake Yuan Bao up,

523
00:27:56,040 --> 00:27:58,112
she will definitely be in danger in the future.

524
00:27:58,479 --> 00:28:00,993
But Chang Yue did save my life!

525
00:28:01,680 --> 00:28:03,952
I must not do

526
00:28:05,119 --> 00:28:06,192
such a terrible thing.

527
00:28:06,359 --> 00:28:07,359
Father.

528
00:28:08,719 --> 00:28:10,352
Yuan Bao grew up under your eyes.

529
00:28:10,800 --> 00:28:12,993
Can you bear watching her bewitched by the fox demon

530
00:28:13,599 --> 00:28:14,599
and

531
00:28:14,680 --> 00:28:16,513
falling into eternal doom in the future?

532
00:28:18,800 --> 00:28:19,458
Besides,

533
00:28:20,959 --> 00:28:22,913
Yuan Bao and I grew up together.

534
00:28:23,959 --> 00:28:25,633
My feelings for her are genuine.

535
00:28:26,166 --> 00:28:27,166
You might be able to do this.

536
00:28:28,479 --> 00:28:30,633
I can't bear to see her take the wrong path.

537
00:28:33,000 --> 00:28:35,192
But I have always been a man of integrity.

538
00:28:35,680 --> 00:28:36,680
This is...

539
00:28:39,119 --> 00:28:40,119
Father.

540
00:28:41,640 --> 00:28:42,913
Is a fox demon more important

541
00:28:43,959 --> 00:28:46,080
than Yuan Bao and your son's

542
00:28:46,160 --> 00:28:48,033
happiness?

543
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:54,153
I have never asked you for anything

544
00:28:54,760 --> 00:28:55,760
but I hope

545
00:28:59,160 --> 00:29:00,673
you can grant me this request.

546
00:29:06,079 --> 00:29:07,079
Father,

547
00:29:07,160 --> 00:29:08,793
stop hesitating.

548
00:29:09,000 --> 00:29:10,832
When dealing with fox demons, we can't be soft-hearted

549
00:29:10,920 --> 00:29:12,352
or take the moral high ground.

550
00:29:13,119 --> 00:29:14,312
No matter the outcome,

551
00:29:14,640 --> 00:29:15,704
it is what he deserves.

552
00:29:18,839 --> 00:29:19,615
Forget it.

553
00:29:20,719 --> 00:29:23,119
There is another thing

554
00:29:23,199 --> 00:29:24,232
that worries me.

555
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:27,000
What is it?

556
00:29:29,719 --> 00:29:30,719
I accidentally came across

557
00:29:30,800 --> 00:29:32,513
a secret about the Xue family.

558
00:29:32,880 --> 00:29:34,712
A hundred years ago, the heavenly fox

559
00:29:35,072 --> 00:29:36,985
bewitched the spiritual particle in the mortal realm

560
00:29:37,239 --> 00:29:39,072
but suffered from unrequited love.

561
00:29:39,160 --> 00:29:40,553
The heavenly fox harbored resentment

562
00:29:40,760 --> 00:29:42,673
and turned his soul into a love curse,

563
00:29:43,199 --> 00:29:44,320
forging a karmic bond

564
00:29:44,400 --> 00:29:45,472
with the spiritual particle

565
00:29:45,680 --> 00:29:46,793
for generations to come.

566
00:29:47,479 --> 00:29:48,553
A love curse?

567
00:29:50,719 --> 00:29:52,993
But now, the soul is inside Yuan Bao.

568
00:29:58,319 --> 00:29:59,319
Could it be...

569
00:30:01,479 --> 00:30:05,553
Yuan Bao might be the spiritual particle.

570
00:30:06,560 --> 00:30:07,560
According to legend,

571
00:30:08,319 --> 00:30:10,472
the spiritual particle can seal the Corpse Puppet King

572
00:30:10,880 --> 00:30:12,553
or release him.

573
00:30:12,640 --> 00:30:13,640
Having the spiritual particle

574
00:30:14,040 --> 00:30:16,352
is equivalent to obtaining the most powerful force in the world.

575
00:30:16,880 --> 00:30:18,793
No wonder Yuan Bao has been in danger recently.

576
00:30:19,959 --> 00:30:21,873
Perhaps it's due to her identity.

577
00:30:25,479 --> 00:30:26,479
If that's the case,

578
00:30:27,000 --> 00:30:28,793
I must not let the fox demon succeed.

579
00:30:29,520 --> 00:30:30,753
Are you saying...

580
00:30:31,400 --> 00:30:32,553
I want to marry Yuan Bao.

581
00:30:34,839 --> 00:30:36,840
Master, it's just as you said

582
00:30:36,920 --> 00:30:39,352
The blame was shifted to Chang Yue.

583
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:41,153
If that's the case,

584
00:30:41,680 --> 00:30:44,112
let's make sure Chang Yue can never retrieve his soul.

585
00:30:44,920 --> 00:30:46,112
Only when he's dead

586
00:30:46,719 --> 00:30:48,753
that he can never obtain his soul.

587
00:30:49,040 --> 00:30:51,112
You want Chang Yue to die?

588
00:30:52,640 --> 00:30:53,712
What are you planning to do?

589
00:30:56,560 --> 00:30:58,192
We use his enemy.

590
00:31:21,079 --> 00:31:22,079
Shen Shen.

591
00:31:22,520 --> 00:31:23,753
Why are you spacing out?

592
00:31:26,359 --> 00:31:28,112
So many things happened today.

593
00:31:29,119 --> 00:31:30,352
I'm not in the mood for anything.

594
00:31:33,640 --> 00:31:34,640
Shen Shen,

595
00:31:36,040 --> 00:31:38,393
do you also think that those people were killed

596
00:31:38,920 --> 00:31:40,793
by Chang Yue?

597
00:31:45,560 --> 00:31:46,712
The evidence is convincing.

598
00:31:47,439 --> 00:31:49,033
What else is there to doubt?

599
00:31:53,160 --> 00:31:54,712
Now I finally understand

600
00:31:55,239 --> 00:31:57,153
why he's protective of Qi Yuan Bao.

601
00:32:03,839 --> 00:32:04,839
Shen Shen,

602
00:32:06,199 --> 00:32:07,432
do you still fancy

603
00:32:08,432 --> 00:32:09,945
Mr. Chang Yue now?

604
00:32:19,439 --> 00:32:20,592
Don't make things up.

605
00:32:23,852 --> 00:32:24,926
But I believe

606
00:32:26,040 --> 00:32:27,312
it's not necessarily a bad thing

607
00:32:28,076 --> 00:32:29,312
to be like Qi Yuan Bao.

608
00:32:30,280 --> 00:32:32,352
At the very least,

609
00:32:32,839 --> 00:32:34,153
she pursued love

610
00:32:34,719 --> 00:32:37,673
passionately and fearlessly.

611
00:32:39,359 --> 00:32:41,553
Why are you still defending them now?

612
00:32:44,800 --> 00:32:45,952
It was just

613
00:32:47,359 --> 00:32:49,072
a spur-of-the-moment realization.

614
00:32:52,719 --> 00:32:53,832
Pursuing love passionately.

615
00:32:54,640 --> 00:32:56,273
is just a nice way of putting it.

616
00:32:56,839 --> 00:32:58,119
If she had let Sect Leader Qi

617
00:32:58,199 --> 00:32:59,199
kill that fox that day,

618
00:32:59,239 --> 00:33:00,832
none of the things would have happened.

619
00:33:03,439 --> 00:33:05,112
To be bewitched and deceived,

620
00:33:06,880 --> 00:33:08,393
she had it coming.

621
00:33:09,160 --> 00:33:09,699
Shen Shen.

622
00:33:11,239 --> 00:33:12,753
Qi Yuan Bao is in a bad state now.

623
00:33:13,920 --> 00:33:15,033
And you still insulted her.

624
00:33:15,640 --> 00:33:17,112
Isn't that a bit too much?

625
00:33:19,400 --> 00:33:21,080
I noticed you've been getting close to Qi Yuan Bao

626
00:33:21,105 --> 00:33:22,105
and Xue Han Yu recently.

627
00:33:22,479 --> 00:33:24,232
And now, you're arguing with me for her sake.

628
00:33:24,525 --> 00:33:25,158
What?

629
00:33:25,560 --> 00:33:27,472
Do you want to join their families?

630
00:33:28,280 --> 00:33:29,280
Shen Shen!

631
00:33:37,520 --> 00:33:38,520
If I

632
00:33:41,400 --> 00:33:43,393
have a crush on someone else,

633
00:33:47,760 --> 00:33:48,993
will you help me?

634
00:33:59,520 --> 00:34:00,753
(Surely one of us)

635
00:34:01,719 --> 00:34:03,432
(must have a happy ending.)
