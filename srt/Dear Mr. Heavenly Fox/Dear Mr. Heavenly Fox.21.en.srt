1
00:01:48,735 --> 00:01:54,042
(Dear Mr. Heavenly Fox)

2
00:01:54,088 --> 00:01:56,979
(Episode 21)

3
00:01:58,879 --> 00:01:59,879
Miss Yi Xuan.

4
00:02:00,508 --> 00:02:01,828
Miss Yi Xuan, something bad happened.

5
00:02:01,909 --> 00:02:03,182
Please go check on His Highness!

6
00:02:03,440 --> 00:02:05,505
- What's wrong with His Highness?   - For some reason,

7
00:02:05,586 --> 00:02:07,240
His Highness's wound is deteriorating rapidly.

8
00:02:07,382 --> 00:02:08,942
It's never hurt this badly before.

9
00:02:09,038 --> 00:02:10,438
Don't worry. Hurry.

10
00:02:10,839 --> 00:02:12,000
Go get my medicine kit.

11
00:02:12,150 --> 00:02:15,503
Chang Yue's wound hasn't healed yet?

12
00:02:21,086 --> 00:02:22,086
Just bear with me.

13
00:02:43,240 --> 00:02:45,433
His Highness is suffering the pain of the Heart-Piercing Arrow.

14
00:02:45,800 --> 00:02:47,282
What should we do?

15
00:02:47,600 --> 00:02:50,233
It's been so long and it hasn't healed,

16
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:52,682
instead, it's getting worse.

17
00:02:53,080 --> 00:02:54,442
It's all right.

18
00:02:54,880 --> 00:02:57,632
I've gotten used to it these days.

19
00:03:02,472 --> 00:03:04,769
The wound has no cure.

20
00:03:05,080 --> 00:03:06,482
If you don't ascend,

21
00:03:06,960 --> 00:03:08,858
you can only live with it like this.

22
00:03:09,399 --> 00:03:10,465
My medicine

23
00:03:11,160 --> 00:03:13,402
can only temporarily relieve some of the pain.

24
00:03:30,639 --> 00:03:31,465
Miss Yi Xuan.

25
00:03:32,720 --> 00:03:33,645
Let me walk you out.

26
00:03:54,699 --> 00:03:55,699
Hu Bu Lin.

27
00:04:00,720 --> 00:04:02,032
Oh, it's you, Young Lady Qi.

28
00:04:02,374 --> 00:04:03,966
What brings you to Yueshen Palace

29
00:04:04,078 --> 00:04:05,482
this late at night?

30
00:04:06,025 --> 00:04:07,225
Why is Chang Yue's wound

31
00:04:08,119 --> 00:04:09,793
so severe?

32
00:04:10,012 --> 00:04:11,125
The audacity!

33
00:04:11,448 --> 00:04:13,368
You want to know? I'm not going to tell you.

34
00:04:13,919 --> 00:04:14,712
Hu Bu Lin.

35
00:04:16,839 --> 00:04:18,001
Just tell me, please?

36
00:04:18,580 --> 00:04:21,380
Why is Chang Yue's wound so severe?

37
00:04:22,200 --> 00:04:24,352
If it was just from the time I stabbed him back then,

38
00:04:24,656 --> 00:04:26,209
it should have healed by now.

39
00:04:26,640 --> 00:04:28,873
So you do remember you stabbed His Highness with your sword.

40
00:04:29,070 --> 00:04:29,559
I...

41
00:04:32,920 --> 00:04:33,906
I made a mistake.

42
00:04:35,839 --> 00:04:37,313
Realizing you made a mistake

43
00:04:37,576 --> 00:04:39,802
is far from enough, Qi Yuan Bao.

44
00:04:40,239 --> 00:04:41,520
Since you want to know so badly,

45
00:04:41,647 --> 00:04:43,082
I'll tell you everything.

46
00:04:43,839 --> 00:04:44,999
The wound on His Highness

47
00:04:45,133 --> 00:04:46,846
is from the Heart-Piercing Arrow.

48
00:04:47,040 --> 00:04:48,722
This wound will never heal,

49
00:04:48,936 --> 00:04:51,642
and every night he suffers excruciating pain.

50
00:04:52,040 --> 00:04:53,362
Do you even know

51
00:04:53,566 --> 00:04:55,879
where this wound came from?

52
00:04:58,119 --> 00:04:59,119
From...

53
00:04:59,880 --> 00:05:00,880
Where did it come from?

54
00:05:01,079 --> 00:05:02,562
It's all because of you.

55
00:05:04,200 --> 00:05:05,682
Because of me?

56
00:05:06,119 --> 00:05:07,119
Qi Yuan Bao,

57
00:05:07,519 --> 00:05:09,072
you can't possibly think

58
00:05:09,293 --> 00:05:10,533
Huo Shu Ya

59
00:05:10,637 --> 00:05:13,190
and one Purple Scale Fruit could heal your severed heart meridian.

60
00:05:14,134 --> 00:05:16,453
The reason you're alive is all thanks to His Highness,

61
00:05:16,534 --> 00:05:18,642
who risked his life to get the Posuo Leaf for you.

62
00:05:19,725 --> 00:05:22,792
His Highness was wounded at that time.

63
00:05:26,519 --> 00:05:27,722
No.

64
00:05:27,959 --> 00:05:29,202
It can't be.

65
00:05:29,440 --> 00:05:30,642
Chang Yue...

66
00:05:30,916 --> 00:05:33,002
Chang Yue never mentioned any of this to me.

67
00:05:34,359 --> 00:05:36,402
His Highness is not one to take credit.

68
00:05:36,627 --> 00:05:37,592
He saved your life.

69
00:05:38,160 --> 00:05:40,232
It's one thing to mistake his effort as someone else's.

70
00:05:40,399 --> 00:05:42,364
But you're so ungrateful that you poisoned him,

71
00:05:42,445 --> 00:05:43,832
and even stabbed him with a sword.

72
00:05:43,999 --> 00:05:44,754
Young Lady Qi,

73
00:05:45,399 --> 00:05:47,593
you stabbed right on the mark.

74
00:05:48,119 --> 00:05:49,479
The wound that just closed

75
00:05:49,614 --> 00:05:50,863
was pierced open again by your sword.

76
00:05:51,799 --> 00:05:54,842
Your murderous intention was telling.

77
00:05:55,679 --> 00:05:56,668
So...

78
00:05:59,160 --> 00:06:00,993
So Chang Yue saved me.

79
00:06:02,239 --> 00:06:03,482
Qi Yuan Bao,

80
00:06:03,760 --> 00:06:05,313
if you have any conscience left,

81
00:06:05,600 --> 00:06:07,272
show mercy on His Highness.

82
00:06:07,386 --> 00:06:09,842
Don't bother him anymore.

83
00:06:17,200 --> 00:06:18,442
No, it can't be.

84
00:06:22,279 --> 00:06:23,522
No, it can't be.

85
00:06:25,360 --> 00:06:27,442
(Aren't you going to ask me what this is?)

86
00:06:27,679 --> 00:06:29,322
(You asked me to take it.)

87
00:06:29,480 --> 00:06:30,802
(Why should I question you?)

88
00:06:32,519 --> 00:06:33,802
Qi Yuan Bao,

89
00:06:36,553 --> 00:06:38,522
what have you done?

90
00:06:46,200 --> 00:06:47,962
How could you be so stupid

91
00:06:48,705 --> 00:06:50,962
as to kill the person who saved your life?

92
00:06:52,079 --> 00:06:53,842
Chang Yue is in

93
00:06:54,915 --> 00:06:56,322
so much pain

94
00:06:57,842 --> 00:07:00,442
and it's all because of you!

95
00:07:13,297 --> 00:07:14,802
I'm sorry.

96
00:07:15,072 --> 00:07:16,505
I'm really sorry.

97
00:07:16,799 --> 00:07:18,202
Chang Yue...

98
00:07:19,321 --> 00:07:20,762
I'm sorry.

99
00:07:22,160 --> 00:07:23,602
I'm sorry.

100
00:07:27,760 --> 00:07:29,162
I wish you

101
00:07:30,152 --> 00:07:31,271
happiness.

102
00:07:33,169 --> 00:07:34,352
Yuan Bao.

103
00:07:53,032 --> 00:07:54,032
You're awake.

104
00:07:56,753 --> 00:07:58,402
Don't move about.

105
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:01,922
Right now, you should be lying down and resting.

106
00:08:02,920 --> 00:08:04,202
Yi Xuan,

107
00:08:04,412 --> 00:08:06,948
is Chang Yue's wound really incurable?

108
00:08:12,885 --> 00:08:15,118
So you found out about Chang Yue's wound.

109
00:08:16,953 --> 00:08:17,912
That wound

110
00:08:23,920 --> 00:08:25,392
is indeed incurable.

111
00:08:28,239 --> 00:08:29,672
But all I can do now

112
00:08:30,519 --> 00:08:32,712
is use medicine to temporarily relieve his pain.

113
00:08:33,673 --> 00:08:36,562
Then, is there anything I can do for him?

114
00:08:36,960 --> 00:08:38,681
Chang Yue was wounded for me.

115
00:08:38,862 --> 00:08:40,482
I can't sit here and do nothing.

116
00:08:46,496 --> 00:08:47,698
If you want,

117
00:08:47,962 --> 00:08:49,515
you can help me with one thing.

118
00:08:51,159 --> 00:08:52,442
But...

119
00:08:53,640 --> 00:08:54,640
But what?

120
00:08:55,479 --> 00:08:57,193
It's just a bit difficult and troublesome.

121
00:08:57,311 --> 00:08:59,590
I'm not afraid of hardship or adversities.

122
00:08:59,738 --> 00:09:00,856
Yi Xuan,

123
00:09:00,960 --> 00:09:02,361
as long as it can reduce Chang Yue's pain,

124
00:09:02,456 --> 00:09:03,802
I'm not afraid of death.

125
00:09:04,200 --> 00:09:05,352
Just tell me.

126
00:09:07,917 --> 00:09:09,429
This is the Autumn Dew Jade Bottle.

127
00:09:09,622 --> 00:09:12,282
Inside Baihua Garden, there's a Frost Flower.

128
00:09:12,607 --> 00:09:14,441
It will produce a drop of nectar soon.

129
00:09:14,880 --> 00:09:18,025
But I don't know which day or which hour it will appear.

130
00:09:18,736 --> 00:09:21,362
If you can collect the nectar and brew it into medicine,

131
00:09:21,653 --> 00:09:23,807
it can help Chang Yue relieve his pain.

132
00:09:24,398 --> 00:09:25,040
Really?

133
00:09:26,840 --> 00:09:27,779
Then I'll go now.

134
00:09:29,653 --> 00:09:30,313
Wait.

135
00:09:32,679 --> 00:09:34,712
The nectar is very delicate.

136
00:09:35,479 --> 00:09:37,362
You have to wait there at all times,

137
00:09:38,031 --> 00:09:39,882
and hold this bottle with steady hands.

138
00:09:40,135 --> 00:09:41,808
There must be no shaking or swaying.

139
00:09:43,159 --> 00:09:45,642
Otherwise, the frost flower nectar will dissipate,

140
00:09:46,159 --> 00:09:47,562
and your effort will be wasted.

141
00:09:47,880 --> 00:09:49,120
I see, Yi Xuan.

142
00:09:49,254 --> 00:09:50,646
I will be very careful.

143
00:09:51,031 --> 00:09:52,362
Thank you.

144
00:10:17,902 --> 00:10:21,802
Young Lady, do you think Miss Qi can do this forever?

145
00:10:25,092 --> 00:10:28,002
How come His Highness's injury flared up so badly this time?

146
00:10:28,285 --> 00:10:30,119
He's been asleep for so long already.

147
00:10:30,367 --> 00:10:32,482
I don't know when he'll wake up.

148
00:10:33,030 --> 00:10:34,830
Once Miss Yi Xuan collects the frost flower nectar

149
00:10:34,966 --> 00:10:36,919
and gives it to His Highness, he will wake up.

150
00:10:44,523 --> 00:10:47,642
Get out of the way. Stop bothering me.

151
00:10:57,320 --> 00:10:58,921
Mister Bee, Madam Bee, I'm begging you.

152
00:10:58,946 --> 00:11:00,491
I'm busy. Go away.

153
00:11:18,359 --> 00:11:19,359
It's fine.

154
00:11:19,479 --> 00:11:22,242
For Chang Yue's sake, I'll spare you.

155
00:11:47,280 --> 00:11:49,882
Miss Qi has been standing here for three days already.

156
00:11:50,379 --> 00:11:51,508
To obtain the frost flower nectar,

157
00:11:51,837 --> 00:11:53,081
she has barely moved at all.

158
00:11:54,320 --> 00:11:58,322
It seems that Miss Qi does have feelings for His Highness.

159
00:12:00,520 --> 00:12:03,082
Compared to the eight lives Chang Yue lost in Wanlu Abyss,

160
00:12:03,840 --> 00:12:05,802
the suffering she's endured is nothing.

161
00:12:15,799 --> 00:12:17,792
Miss Yi Xuan, it's time to collect the nectar.

162
00:12:20,520 --> 00:12:21,520
Let's go.

163
00:12:33,880 --> 00:12:34,618
Great!

164
00:12:35,189 --> 00:12:36,152
It's finally happening.

165
00:12:58,133 --> 00:12:59,133
Yi Xuan...

166
00:13:04,479 --> 00:13:05,643
Yi Xuan.

167
00:13:05,976 --> 00:13:08,202
What are you doing?

168
00:13:09,479 --> 00:13:10,343
Collecting nectar.

169
00:13:15,760 --> 00:13:16,760
So

170
00:13:17,910 --> 00:13:20,352
you knew the nectar would appear at this time.

171
00:13:21,200 --> 00:13:22,642
And there was no need

172
00:13:22,960 --> 00:13:26,112
for me to stand here with this bottle foolishly for four days.

173
00:13:28,974 --> 00:13:30,325
Do you feel wronged?

174
00:13:31,794 --> 00:13:34,628
Didn't you say you wanted to do this for Chang Yue?

175
00:13:35,886 --> 00:13:37,821
If you feel wronged because we made you

176
00:13:37,846 --> 00:13:38,950
stand here for four days,

177
00:13:39,799 --> 00:13:41,710
then what Chang Yue had sacrificed for you

178
00:13:42,119 --> 00:13:43,182
is truly not worth it.

179
00:13:44,431 --> 00:13:45,953
I don't feel aggrieved.

180
00:13:48,078 --> 00:13:49,322
I'm glad that you don't feel that way.

181
00:13:50,039 --> 00:13:52,762
But standing here for four days

182
00:13:52,960 --> 00:13:54,122
must be tiring.

183
00:13:54,320 --> 00:13:56,282
Go back, get rinsed, and have a good rest.

184
00:13:59,359 --> 00:13:59,992
Miss Qi,

185
00:14:00,775 --> 00:14:02,242
please don't resent me.

186
00:14:03,400 --> 00:14:04,802
I understand.

187
00:14:05,799 --> 00:14:07,042
After all,

188
00:14:07,440 --> 00:14:09,193
everyone in Beiming

189
00:14:10,280 --> 00:14:12,082
feels bad for Chang Yue.

190
00:14:13,320 --> 00:14:14,320
Miss Qi,

191
00:14:14,489 --> 00:14:17,362
why don't you take this nectar to Chang Yue?

192
00:15:11,239 --> 00:15:12,239
Chang Yue,

193
00:15:12,840 --> 00:15:14,202
do you feel any better?

194
00:15:34,946 --> 00:15:35,965
You fool.

195
00:15:38,280 --> 00:15:39,633
Why did you

196
00:15:41,159 --> 00:15:42,753
hide these things from me?

197
00:15:58,840 --> 00:16:00,002
Chang Yue,

198
00:16:00,359 --> 00:16:01,712
how come you have it?

199
00:16:05,200 --> 00:16:06,722
I thought

200
00:16:07,159 --> 00:16:08,562
it was lost forever.

201
00:16:11,799 --> 00:16:13,602
So it came back to you.

202
00:16:20,559 --> 00:16:21,762
You're probably

203
00:16:23,760 --> 00:16:25,322
going to give it

204
00:16:26,880 --> 00:16:28,753
to Yi Xuan, right?

205
00:16:38,440 --> 00:16:39,440
Chang Yue,

206
00:16:41,640 --> 00:16:42,882
are you really

207
00:16:44,559 --> 00:16:46,482
going to marry Yi Xuan?

208
00:17:13,160 --> 00:17:14,362
Chang Yue.

209
00:17:15,969 --> 00:17:17,162
Yuan Bao.

210
00:17:17,839 --> 00:17:19,050
Don't go.

211
00:17:23,239 --> 00:17:25,673
Chang Yue, what did you say?

212
00:17:27,319 --> 00:17:28,762
Don't go.

213
00:17:30,040 --> 00:17:31,842
What are you talking about?

214
00:17:33,160 --> 00:17:34,442
Don't...

215
00:17:38,920 --> 00:17:39,938
Don't go.

216
00:18:06,719 --> 00:18:08,479
Your Highness, you're finally awake!

217
00:18:08,599 --> 00:18:09,842
How wonderful.

218
00:18:12,400 --> 00:18:13,279
How long was I out?

219
00:18:13,839 --> 00:18:15,600
You were unconscious for four days.

220
00:18:15,733 --> 00:18:17,202
We were all so worried.

221
00:18:19,640 --> 00:18:20,832
Four days?

222
00:18:23,839 --> 00:18:25,192
Then she must have left already.

223
00:18:25,431 --> 00:18:26,446
Who?

224
00:18:29,959 --> 00:18:31,393
Did Miss Qi come by last night?

225
00:18:31,640 --> 00:18:32,640
No.

226
00:18:32,721 --> 00:18:34,842
Miss Yi Xuan probably came to deliver the medicine.

227
00:18:35,359 --> 00:18:36,722
Could it be that Yuan Bao

228
00:18:37,599 --> 00:18:39,153
has truly left Beiming?

229
00:18:39,719 --> 00:18:41,242
Miss Qi?

230
00:18:41,479 --> 00:18:43,042
I'm not aware that she is leaving.

231
00:18:48,920 --> 00:18:50,112
Prepare some snacks

232
00:18:50,239 --> 00:18:51,432
and come with me to Yilan Hall.

233
00:18:51,520 --> 00:18:53,080
Okay. Miss Yi Xuan

234
00:18:53,160 --> 00:18:55,639
has really gone out of her way to take care of you.

235
00:18:55,781 --> 00:18:57,052
We really should thank her properly.

236
00:18:58,393 --> 00:19:00,042
- Go now.   - Noted.

237
00:19:11,719 --> 00:19:12,719
Are you crazy?

238
00:19:14,920 --> 00:19:16,200
But this trip

239
00:19:16,280 --> 00:19:17,513
was actually pretty interesting.

240
00:19:17,760 --> 00:19:19,480
I didn't expect the people of Beiming

241
00:19:19,560 --> 00:19:20,913
to be so warm and hospitable.

242
00:19:21,319 --> 00:19:23,553
Can you stop being so ignorant?

243
00:19:24,119 --> 00:19:25,432
You're embarrassing me.

244
00:19:25,920 --> 00:19:27,840
But I think I've learned something today.

245
00:19:27,920 --> 00:19:29,960
You can't just listen to rumors.

246
00:19:30,040 --> 00:19:31,560
You have to see for yourself.

247
00:19:31,640 --> 00:19:32,640
Shut up.

248
00:19:32,920 --> 00:19:34,560
Stop giving me a lecture. I don't like it.

249
00:19:34,640 --> 00:19:35,640
I'm serious.

250
00:19:35,920 --> 00:19:37,519
Before I came to Beiming,

251
00:19:37,599 --> 00:19:38,840
I thought everyone here

252
00:19:38,920 --> 00:19:40,800
was fierce and menacing.

253
00:19:40,920 --> 00:19:41,920
Like you.

254
00:19:42,520 --> 00:19:44,993
But after coming here, I realized

255
00:19:45,119 --> 00:19:46,200
that everyone except you

256
00:19:46,280 --> 00:19:48,320
is actually pretty kind and welcoming.

257
00:19:48,400 --> 00:19:49,481
Of course. Did you think

258
00:19:49,561 --> 00:19:50,592
everyone was like you humans?

259
00:19:50,800 --> 00:19:52,080
You humans are narrow-minded,

260
00:19:52,160 --> 00:19:53,560
short-sighted, cowardly,

261
00:19:53,640 --> 00:19:54,640
and have tiny noses and eyes.

262
00:19:54,800 --> 00:19:56,279
We have so many comments about your kind.

263
00:19:56,359 --> 00:19:57,359
You...

264
00:19:58,160 --> 00:19:59,160
What?

265
00:19:59,280 --> 00:20:00,280
Forget it.

266
00:20:00,359 --> 00:20:02,119
I can't beat you, so I'll just avoid you.

267
00:20:02,526 --> 00:20:03,526
Come back.

268
00:20:05,520 --> 00:20:06,520
What?

269
00:20:07,520 --> 00:20:09,200
How do you humans usually

270
00:20:09,280 --> 00:20:11,232
insult me? Tell me. Let me hear it.

271
00:20:12,680 --> 00:20:13,680
You really want to know?

272
00:20:14,439 --> 00:20:15,439
Tell me.

273
00:20:16,040 --> 00:20:17,153
I promise not to hit you.

274
00:20:19,640 --> 00:20:20,753
In the mortal realm,

275
00:20:21,319 --> 00:20:22,393
the stories we tell

276
00:20:22,640 --> 00:20:25,393
are about important, influential figures.

277
00:20:26,160 --> 00:20:27,432
As for you...

278
00:20:29,880 --> 00:20:31,673
- No one knows you.   - Ugly freak.

279
00:20:32,160 --> 00:20:33,160
What do you mean by that?

280
00:20:33,800 --> 00:20:35,279
- Surrender now.   - I won't.

281
00:20:35,359 --> 00:20:37,280
- Are you asking for a beating?   - I'm not!

282
00:20:37,439 --> 00:20:38,920
Get back here! Don't let me catch you!

283
00:20:52,640 --> 00:20:55,112
(So she truly left.)

284
00:20:55,439 --> 00:20:56,439
Chang Yue?

285
00:20:57,880 --> 00:20:58,913
What brought you here?

286
00:20:59,680 --> 00:21:01,481
Miss Yi Xuan, these are pastries His Highness

287
00:21:01,561 --> 00:21:03,153
specially brought for you.

288
00:21:03,359 --> 00:21:05,673
Thank you for taking care of him these past few days.

289
00:21:06,680 --> 00:21:07,793
It is my duty.

290
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:09,000
You're welcome.

291
00:21:10,680 --> 00:21:12,393
Stay and have some tea.

292
00:21:13,920 --> 00:21:15,873
Sorry, there are other matters in my palace.

293
00:21:16,280 --> 00:21:16,872
I'll be leaving now.

294
00:21:17,359 --> 00:21:18,359
Let go of me!

295
00:21:18,439 --> 00:21:19,439
Chang Yue.

296
00:21:19,812 --> 00:21:20,812
You...

297
00:21:21,800 --> 00:21:23,072
- You're strangling me.   - Die!

298
00:21:25,800 --> 00:21:26,205
Chang...

299
00:21:27,160 --> 00:21:28,560
Chang Yue, I...

300
00:21:32,560 --> 00:21:33,276
Chang Yue.

301
00:21:34,446 --> 00:21:35,169
Chang Yue.

302
00:21:36,280 --> 00:21:37,960
Chang Yue, did you come here

303
00:21:38,040 --> 00:21:39,800
because you want to speak with me?

304
00:21:39,880 --> 00:21:41,033
What's wrong with Chang Yue?

305
00:21:41,479 --> 00:21:42,479
I didn't cross him.

306
00:21:42,640 --> 00:21:44,112
Why does he look like he wants to devour me?

307
00:21:46,719 --> 00:21:48,513
Didn't you say you were leaving?

308
00:21:49,040 --> 00:21:50,040
Why haven't you left yet?

309
00:21:52,199 --> 00:21:53,913
I know you want me to leave,

310
00:21:55,040 --> 00:21:57,793
but I don't want to leave anymore.

311
00:21:59,560 --> 00:22:00,560
Why?

312
00:22:09,479 --> 00:22:10,858
Don't go.

313
00:22:14,993 --> 00:22:15,993
Because the person

314
00:22:16,612 --> 00:22:17,806
I care about the most is here.

315
00:22:18,879 --> 00:22:19,879
I can't leave.

316
00:22:26,788 --> 00:22:27,875
Is it you?

317
00:22:56,698 --> 00:22:57,698
Ugly freak.

318
00:22:58,400 --> 00:22:59,952
I didn't know you cared about me this much.

319
00:23:01,880 --> 00:23:02,880
I don't know you.

320
00:23:03,479 --> 00:23:04,712
Are you asking for another beating?

321
00:23:30,439 --> 00:23:31,439
Sir,

322
00:23:31,479 --> 00:23:32,913
we'll arrive at Suiyue Mountain soon.

323
00:23:37,880 --> 00:23:39,039
Remind Yu and the others

324
00:23:39,119 --> 00:23:40,153
to be careful and cautious

325
00:23:40,280 --> 00:23:41,592
when we're there.

326
00:23:41,839 --> 00:23:42,839
Do not act rashly

327
00:23:43,079 --> 00:23:44,553
without my orders.

328
00:23:44,800 --> 00:23:45,800
Noted.

329
00:23:51,760 --> 00:23:52,760
Shu Ya.

330
00:23:53,560 --> 00:23:54,560
Shu Ya.

331
00:23:56,079 --> 00:23:57,153
Father, what's the matter?

332
00:23:57,640 --> 00:23:58,640
What's on your mind?

333
00:23:59,332 --> 00:24:01,212
Nothing. I just spaced out for a moment.

334
00:24:04,079 --> 00:24:04,852
Shu Ya,

335
00:24:05,199 --> 00:24:06,199
heed my advice.

336
00:24:06,640 --> 00:24:08,393
Don't think about things that don't belong

337
00:24:08,560 --> 00:24:09,673
to you,

338
00:24:10,359 --> 00:24:12,793
lest you spiral further.

339
00:24:13,800 --> 00:24:15,112
Father, don't worry.

340
00:24:15,959 --> 00:24:16,959
I know what I'm doing.

341
00:24:17,199 --> 00:24:18,199
Good.

342
00:24:40,599 --> 00:24:43,393
(Should I go to Yueshen Palace)

343
00:24:43,719 --> 00:24:44,873
(to check on Chang Yue secretly?)

344
00:25:36,160 --> 00:25:37,160
Chang Yue,

345
00:25:38,280 --> 00:25:40,513
I miss you so much that I can't sleep.

346
00:25:41,160 --> 00:25:42,160
But you're here

347
00:25:42,959 --> 00:25:44,232
sleeping so soundly.

348
00:26:01,193 --> 00:26:02,193
Chang Yue,

349
00:26:04,079 --> 00:26:05,753
I know you want me to leave,

350
00:26:08,040 --> 00:26:09,753
but I can't leave yet.

351
00:26:11,680 --> 00:26:12,680
Because

352
00:26:14,040 --> 00:26:15,913
I need to return your soul to you.

353
00:26:17,439 --> 00:26:18,832
If you want me to leave,

354
00:26:19,719 --> 00:26:21,033
at least wait until

355
00:26:22,079 --> 00:26:24,273
I return the soul to you.

356
00:26:25,760 --> 00:26:26,760
I know

357
00:26:28,199 --> 00:26:30,553
you can only ascend after you successfully

358
00:26:31,520 --> 00:26:32,712
retrieve your soul.

359
00:26:39,160 --> 00:26:40,993
And then, the injuries on your body

360
00:26:42,760 --> 00:26:44,072
will heal.

361
00:26:52,479 --> 00:26:53,479
Do you know?

362
00:26:53,959 --> 00:26:55,920
Today, I went out

363
00:26:56,000 --> 00:26:57,000
with Yan Hong Zhen.

364
00:26:57,560 --> 00:26:58,913
I saw many

365
00:26:59,199 --> 00:27:01,112
cute children of your clan.

366
00:27:01,560 --> 00:27:02,633
They are just as cute as you.

367
00:27:04,760 --> 00:27:07,312
But at that moment, I was thinking

368
00:27:08,359 --> 00:27:09,513
when

369
00:27:10,520 --> 00:27:12,673
you would show me the place.

370
00:27:23,680 --> 00:27:24,680
Chang Yue?

371
00:27:26,040 --> 00:27:27,432
Are you awake?

372
00:27:32,098 --> 00:27:32,938
Chang Yue.

373
00:27:40,199 --> 00:27:41,199
Do you know

374
00:27:41,880 --> 00:27:43,273
that when you're asleep,

375
00:27:43,800 --> 00:27:45,352
you have terrible sleeping habits?

376
00:27:45,640 --> 00:27:46,793
You always like to hug people.

377
00:27:53,079 --> 00:27:54,079
I don't care.

378
00:27:54,640 --> 00:27:56,712
You hugged me first this time.

379
00:27:56,959 --> 00:27:58,232
So I'm returning the favor.

380
00:27:59,000 --> 00:28:00,273
Don't be mad at me

381
00:28:00,920 --> 00:28:02,112
when you wake up.

382
00:28:23,160 --> 00:28:24,160
Huo.

383
00:28:25,239 --> 00:28:26,239
Su.

384
00:28:28,319 --> 00:28:29,560
We've been traveling for days.

385
00:28:29,640 --> 00:28:30,945
Let's settle down here first.

386
00:28:31,160 --> 00:28:32,352
After we rest up,

387
00:28:32,479 --> 00:28:34,873
we'll head up the mountain to look for clues and the real culprit.

388
00:28:36,959 --> 00:28:38,600
- Okay.   - After you.

389
00:28:38,680 --> 00:28:39,680
After you.

390
00:28:46,719 --> 00:28:48,192
Why are there so many butterflies here?

391
00:28:48,520 --> 00:28:50,633
Yes, there are butterflies everywhere.

392
00:28:53,760 --> 00:28:55,793
Yuan Bao, be careful.

393
00:28:58,800 --> 00:28:59,800
Stop it.

394
00:29:00,079 --> 00:29:01,432
We've been putting up an act all along.

395
00:29:01,680 --> 00:29:03,400
We have to keep it up and don't get caught.

396
00:29:03,520 --> 00:29:04,520
I know.

397
00:29:07,280 --> 00:29:08,839
Okay. Let's go.

398
00:29:19,719 --> 00:29:20,832
Keep a close eye on Qi Yuan Bao.

399
00:29:21,319 --> 00:29:23,239
Tell me immediately if she makes any moves.

400
00:29:23,319 --> 00:29:24,319
Noted.

401
00:29:30,599 --> 00:29:31,246
Master,

402
00:29:31,959 --> 00:29:32,959
everyone

403
00:29:33,000 --> 00:29:34,312
has gathered at Suiyue Mountain.

404
00:29:34,880 --> 00:29:36,519
In my opinion, Qi Lian and the rest will soon

405
00:29:36,599 --> 00:29:37,599
find the mausoleum.

406
00:29:37,679 --> 00:29:39,352
I'm afraid we'll be in trouble then.

407
00:29:42,680 --> 00:29:43,913
Then let's act tonight.

408
00:29:44,359 --> 00:29:45,079
Don't screw up.

409
00:29:45,640 --> 00:29:46,640
Yes, Master.

410
00:29:46,719 --> 00:29:48,033
I'll arrange for it right away.

411
00:29:52,839 --> 00:29:53,839
Eat more.

412
00:29:56,719 --> 00:29:58,519
- It's mine!   - It's mine!

413
00:29:58,599 --> 00:30:00,120
- It's mine!   - It's mine!

414
00:30:00,200 --> 00:30:01,712
- I...   - Just hand it over.

415
00:30:03,079 --> 00:30:04,079
Master.

416
00:30:04,239 --> 00:30:06,112
Look! Tian is stealing my meat again!

417
00:30:07,560 --> 00:30:09,033
Don't bully Qi Liu.

418
00:30:11,000 --> 00:30:12,560
Qi Liu, they don't care about you.

419
00:30:12,640 --> 00:30:14,592
- But I do.   - Thank you, Master.

420
00:30:15,479 --> 00:30:17,160
Master, I want some too.

421
00:30:20,520 --> 00:30:21,520
Yuan Bao.

422
00:30:21,560 --> 00:30:22,560
Dinner's ready.

423
00:30:24,219 --> 00:30:25,219
Yuan Bao.

424
00:30:26,479 --> 00:30:27,712
Open the door already.

425
00:30:32,119 --> 00:30:33,719
You're so late. Do you want me to starve?

426
00:30:42,520 --> 00:30:44,239
I feel a bit light-headed.

427
00:30:44,319 --> 00:30:46,199
- I...   - I feel woozy.

428
00:30:46,359 --> 00:30:47,359
What's going on?

429
00:30:50,920 --> 00:30:52,200
Qi Huan. Qi...
