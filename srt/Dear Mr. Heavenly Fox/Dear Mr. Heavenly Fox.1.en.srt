1
00:01:48,962 --> 00:01:54,046
(Dear Mr. Heavenly Fox)

2
00:01:54,162 --> 00:01:57,195
(Episode 1)

3
00:01:58,080 --> 00:02:01,145
(Since ancient times, humans and foxes have lived in peace.)

4
00:02:02,440 --> 00:02:05,762
(Until a hundred years ago, disasters plagued the human world.)

5
00:02:06,736 --> 00:02:08,492
(To protect the common people, the spirit particle)

6
00:02:08,624 --> 00:02:10,130
(intended to sacrifice himself upon reaching adulthood,)

7
00:02:10,211 --> 00:02:11,842
(to save the world.)

8
00:02:12,912 --> 00:02:14,664
(However, the Heavenly Fox, Bi Chuan,)

9
00:02:14,745 --> 00:02:16,042
(fell in love with the spirit particle.)

10
00:02:17,279 --> 00:02:18,520
(To prevent the sacrifice,)

11
00:02:18,639 --> 00:02:20,600
(she rammed into Suiyue Mountain and died.)

12
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:24,082
(But this caused demonic energy to overflow.)

13
00:02:25,360 --> 00:02:26,479
(In that critical moment,)

14
00:02:26,600 --> 00:02:27,722
(the spirit particle used his physical body)

15
00:02:27,842 --> 00:02:29,202
(to seal the Corpse Puppet King,)

16
00:02:29,399 --> 00:02:30,960
(bringing peace to the world.)

17
00:02:32,360 --> 00:02:34,842
(Since then, humans and foxes became estranged,)

18
00:02:35,039 --> 00:02:36,602
(no longer interacting.)

19
00:03:06,319 --> 00:03:09,199
Your Highness, the Soul Fruit will be ripe soon.

20
00:03:09,309 --> 00:03:11,148
Eat it, and you can ascend smoothly

21
00:03:11,229 --> 00:03:12,323
and strengthen the Beiming Barrier.

22
00:03:12,404 --> 00:03:13,558
Go and guard outside.

23
00:03:13,639 --> 00:03:15,479
- Don't let any strangers in.   - Yes.

24
00:03:18,240 --> 00:03:19,598
No more bets.

25
00:03:19,679 --> 00:03:20,838
Big, huh? Put it on my side.

26
00:03:20,919 --> 00:03:22,199
- Come on.   - Place your bets.

27
00:03:22,280 --> 00:03:23,280
Bet more!

28
00:03:23,360 --> 00:03:24,360
- No more bets.   - Big?

29
00:03:24,440 --> 00:03:25,498
- Small?   - Make your choice.

30
00:03:25,579 --> 00:03:26,658
Pick now. No take-backs.

31
00:03:26,738 --> 00:03:28,573
Opening now. Sure? Let's go. Open!

32
00:03:28,669 --> 00:03:31,122
Big!

33
00:03:33,679 --> 00:03:35,522
- Thank you.   - Hurry.

34
00:03:35,800 --> 00:03:37,558
Yuan Bao, we've had enough fun.

35
00:03:37,668 --> 00:03:38,909
Should we go home?

36
00:03:39,241 --> 00:03:42,399
If Uncle finds out we sneaked out again, he'll definitely break our legs.

37
00:03:42,491 --> 00:03:45,118
Coward. It's so lively today.

38
00:03:45,199 --> 00:03:46,522
You can go back by yourself.

39
00:03:47,639 --> 00:03:49,599
But you are the hope of our sect.

40
00:03:49,680 --> 00:03:50,999
If you visit the casino every day,

41
00:03:51,080 --> 00:03:52,600
Uncle will be furious.

42
00:03:53,240 --> 00:03:54,959
If I'm the hope of the Qishan Sect,

43
00:03:55,040 --> 00:03:57,119
then the Qishan Sect is doomed.

44
00:03:57,440 --> 00:03:58,918
All I, Qi Yuan Bao, want in this life

45
00:03:58,999 --> 00:04:00,919
are wealth

46
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:02,399
and eye candies.

47
00:04:02,603 --> 00:04:03,527
That's enough for me.

48
00:04:03,960 --> 00:04:06,440
- How ambitious.   - Of course.

49
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:13,559
Uncle... Uncle Huan.

50
00:04:13,934 --> 00:04:16,374
What are you doing here?

51
00:04:24,200 --> 00:04:25,398
Uncle Huan, look!

52
00:04:25,482 --> 00:04:26,559
- A fox!   - Where?

53
00:04:26,640 --> 00:04:27,679
- A fox?   - Don't trick me.

54
00:04:27,779 --> 00:04:29,199
- Where?   - It's been a century

55
00:04:29,280 --> 00:04:30,565
since we last saw a fox in the mortal realm.

56
00:04:30,720 --> 00:04:31,987
It's true, Uncle Huan.

57
00:04:32,068 --> 00:04:33,216
If you don't chase it now,

58
00:04:33,297 --> 00:04:34,592
you won't catch it.

59
00:04:48,720 --> 00:04:51,200
You think you can catch me?

60
00:05:42,049 --> 00:05:45,250
This... What the heck is this place?

61
00:05:45,527 --> 00:05:47,522
Wasn't I just on the street?

62
00:06:20,559 --> 00:06:21,512
Who are you?

63
00:06:23,442 --> 00:06:24,552
How did you get in here?

64
00:06:27,168 --> 00:06:31,444
Sir, let's talk this over.

65
00:06:31,634 --> 00:06:34,986
No need to draw swords.

66
00:06:36,720 --> 00:06:37,422
Tell me.

67
00:06:39,160 --> 00:06:40,439
I'd like to know too.

68
00:06:40,854 --> 00:06:43,574
One moment I was happily strolling through the market,

69
00:06:43,696 --> 00:06:44,845
and the next thing I knew,

70
00:06:45,205 --> 00:06:46,645
I was in this strange place.

71
00:06:56,848 --> 00:06:58,888
(The Soul Fruit is ripe. The time has come.)

72
00:07:26,880 --> 00:07:28,760
(What's going on? My soul...)

73
00:07:28,920 --> 00:07:30,471
(Why did it fly towards her?)

74
00:07:30,557 --> 00:07:31,842
What is this?

75
00:07:37,839 --> 00:07:41,042
Hey! Why are you being so unreasonable? This thing is clearly...

76
00:08:10,920 --> 00:08:12,842
Oh, no. This is bad.

77
00:08:15,992 --> 00:08:17,359
- The barrier is broken.   - Is it bad?

78
00:08:17,384 --> 00:08:20,082
- The barrier of Suiyue Mountain is broken.   - How did the barrier break?

79
00:08:55,960 --> 00:08:57,762
I...

80
00:09:27,159 --> 00:09:29,962
So there really are demon foxes in this world.

81
00:09:33,129 --> 00:09:34,608
What ill fortune is this?

82
00:09:34,719 --> 00:09:37,242
I ran into a rare demon fox.

83
00:09:37,559 --> 00:09:39,242
Give me back my soul.

84
00:10:01,320 --> 00:10:02,557
Let go of me.

85
00:10:02,721 --> 00:10:04,242
Give me back my soul.

86
00:10:04,400 --> 00:10:06,722
What soul? I have no idea what you're talking about.

87
00:10:24,016 --> 00:10:25,762
(Oh, no. Who is causing this?)

88
00:10:25,919 --> 00:10:27,600
(I need to get the fruit out as soon as possible.)

89
00:10:29,644 --> 00:10:30,802
(It's too late.)

90
00:10:39,840 --> 00:10:41,504
Your Highness, what's going on?

91
00:10:41,585 --> 00:10:43,080
How can there be a human here?

92
00:10:43,262 --> 00:10:44,741
Why did you erase her memory?

93
00:10:45,559 --> 00:10:47,162
She has already swallowed the fruit.

94
00:10:47,280 --> 00:10:48,559
I must handle this with care.

95
00:10:48,760 --> 00:10:50,609
What? She ate the fruit?

96
00:10:50,690 --> 00:10:52,562
Does that mean you can't ascend?

97
00:10:55,320 --> 00:10:56,722
Let's return to Beiming for now

98
00:10:56,919 --> 00:10:58,242
and discuss this later.

99
00:10:59,799 --> 00:11:02,320
Uncle Huan, what's with this red light?

100
00:11:02,595 --> 00:11:04,838
It seems to be coming from Suiyue Mountain.

101
00:11:04,919 --> 00:11:06,440
This is an ominous sign.

102
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:08,802
Quick, we need to find Yuan Bao.

103
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:10,020
Okay.

104
00:11:10,760 --> 00:11:12,322
- Yuan Bao, show yourself.   - Yuan Bao.

105
00:11:12,403 --> 00:11:13,520
- Yuan Bao.   - Yuan Bao.

106
00:11:13,601 --> 00:11:15,482
- Where are you?   - Where are you, Yuan Bao?

107
00:11:15,679 --> 00:11:17,840
- Yuan Bao.   - Yuan Bao.

108
00:11:18,201 --> 00:11:19,361
- Young Lady.   - Uncle Huan!

109
00:11:19,442 --> 00:11:20,461
- Young Lady.   - Yuan Bao.

110
00:11:20,577 --> 00:11:22,918
- Yuan Bao.   - Yuan Bao, wake up!

111
00:11:22,999 --> 00:11:25,602
- Yuan Bao.   - Take Young Lady back to the Qishan Sect.

112
00:11:36,679 --> 00:11:37,919
A mere mortal

113
00:11:38,047 --> 00:11:39,722
was actually able to consume your soul.

114
00:11:41,149 --> 00:11:42,192
It's my fault.

115
00:11:42,760 --> 00:11:44,038
No, it's not.

116
00:11:44,799 --> 00:11:46,842
Humans have always been cunning and deceitful.

117
00:11:47,039 --> 00:11:48,599
You are inexperienced,

118
00:11:48,719 --> 00:11:49,799
so you're not her match.

119
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:51,159
That's understandable.

120
00:11:55,159 --> 00:11:56,759
The Soul Fruit is connected to the spirit root.

121
00:11:57,280 --> 00:11:58,559
We foxes can hardly touch it,

122
00:11:58,760 --> 00:12:00,559
let alone a mortal.

123
00:12:00,714 --> 00:12:02,475
How could a mortal like her swallow it?

124
00:12:04,559 --> 00:12:07,105
(Could it be that ill-fated relationship that ruined our ascension)

125
00:12:07,440 --> 00:12:08,802
(is back again?)

126
00:12:09,039 --> 00:12:10,682
But based on my observation,

127
00:12:11,520 --> 00:12:13,093
that woman is unremarkable.

128
00:12:13,231 --> 00:12:14,953
There's nothing special about her.

129
00:12:16,799 --> 00:12:19,159
Chang Yue, let me see your life chart.

130
00:12:35,080 --> 00:12:36,440
Outrageous!

131
00:12:37,551 --> 00:12:38,991
What's wrong?

132
00:12:41,159 --> 00:12:43,159
Grandmother, what is it?

133
00:12:46,473 --> 00:12:49,562
Chang Yue, your soul is already in her body

134
00:12:49,880 --> 00:12:51,200
and has formed a karmic bond with her.

135
00:12:51,359 --> 00:12:53,760
Karmic bond? What are we going to do?

136
00:12:53,958 --> 00:12:56,598
It's all my fault. I didn't protect His Highness well enough.

137
00:12:56,718 --> 00:12:58,439
That's why His Highness was tainted by that mortal.

138
00:13:00,559 --> 00:13:01,640
What is a karmic bond?

139
00:13:02,799 --> 00:13:04,082
A karmic bond is...

140
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:11,598
It's just an evil practice that our clan abandoned hundreds of years ago.

141
00:13:11,695 --> 00:13:13,799
It's harmful for your ascension and cultivation.

142
00:13:17,119 --> 00:13:18,522
Once the soul enters the body,

143
00:13:18,679 --> 00:13:21,442
within seven days, it will merge with the host.

144
00:13:22,280 --> 00:13:24,282
If it's not taken out before that,

145
00:13:24,760 --> 00:13:26,282
the consequences will be unimaginable.

146
00:13:29,200 --> 00:13:31,802
Hu Bu Lin, retrieve the soul with His Highness.

147
00:13:32,080 --> 00:13:33,359
There can't be any mistakes.

148
00:13:33,479 --> 00:13:34,520
Yes, Grandmother.

149
00:13:34,640 --> 00:13:35,960
I will not fail you.

150
00:13:38,679 --> 00:13:41,520
Chang Yue, this woman was able to consume your soul.

151
00:13:41,840 --> 00:13:43,400
I'm afraid she's our nemesis.

152
00:13:43,559 --> 00:13:46,520
Make sure to retrieve the soul and return to Beiming immediately.

153
00:13:46,679 --> 00:13:48,122
Then, repair the barrier.

154
00:13:48,960 --> 00:13:50,020
Yes.

155
00:13:57,377 --> 00:13:59,602
- Let's go in quickly.   - Okay.

156
00:14:13,376 --> 00:14:15,523
Uncle Huan, is Yuan Bao alright?

157
00:14:21,840 --> 00:14:24,882
(Years ago, I clearly severed Yuan Bao's spirit root.)

158
00:14:25,200 --> 00:14:26,802
(But why is her spiritual power)

159
00:14:27,080 --> 00:14:28,442
(so abundant now?)

160
00:14:29,159 --> 00:14:30,760
(What's going on?)

161
00:14:34,749 --> 00:14:36,082
Yuan Bao, you're awake!

162
00:14:36,320 --> 00:14:38,039
- Yuan Bao.   - Yuan Bao!

163
00:14:42,212 --> 00:14:43,212
Father?

164
00:14:48,359 --> 00:14:50,282
I... How did I get here?

165
00:14:50,473 --> 00:14:53,242
Yuan Bao, what happened to you outside?

166
00:14:53,640 --> 00:14:55,159
Why did you suddenly faint?

167
00:14:58,880 --> 00:14:59,886
Yuan Bao.

168
00:15:03,880 --> 00:15:05,719
I... I can't remember.

169
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:08,402
I only remember

170
00:15:08,559 --> 00:15:11,000
I entered a small alley,

171
00:15:11,840 --> 00:15:14,039
and then inexplicably,

172
00:15:14,440 --> 00:15:15,882
I returned here.

173
00:15:16,960 --> 00:15:18,239
A small alley?

174
00:15:19,176 --> 00:15:22,042
Uncle Huan, she wouldn't have any problems, right?

175
00:15:22,200 --> 00:15:23,482
What's wrong with me?

176
00:15:25,400 --> 00:15:27,122
Your spirit root suddenly showed anomalies.

177
00:15:27,280 --> 00:15:28,522
The reason is still unknown.

178
00:15:28,679 --> 00:15:30,242
Yuan Bao, remember this.

179
00:15:30,679 --> 00:15:31,842
In the future, when you go out,

180
00:15:31,960 --> 00:15:33,642
never use your spiritual power without permission.

181
00:15:33,760 --> 00:15:35,122
And don't make it known.

182
00:15:35,609 --> 00:15:37,895
- Anomalies?   - Yes.

183
00:15:41,479 --> 00:15:43,119
Yuan Bao's spirit root has recovered.

184
00:15:43,400 --> 00:15:47,000
Could it be related to today's disturbance at Suiyue Mountain?

185
00:15:48,440 --> 00:15:49,880
Sect Leader, are you worried

186
00:15:50,200 --> 00:15:51,652
about the fox clan making a comeback?

187
00:15:52,599 --> 00:15:53,325
Yes.

188
00:15:55,570 --> 00:15:58,171
A hundred years ago, a demon fox descended,

189
00:15:58,520 --> 00:16:01,398
seduced the spirit particle into ramming the Suiyue Mountain three times,

190
00:16:01,479 --> 00:16:02,522
releasing the Corpse Puppet King

191
00:16:02,603 --> 00:16:04,282
and causing chaos in the world.

192
00:16:04,880 --> 00:16:08,080
Later, the spirit particle used his body to repair Suiyue Mountain.

193
00:16:08,239 --> 00:16:10,042
That's how the turmoil was quelled.

194
00:16:10,320 --> 00:16:12,940
Now, Suiyue Mountain has suddenly shown abnormalities.

195
00:16:13,080 --> 00:16:14,282
It's probably

196
00:16:15,042 --> 00:16:17,002
a sign of the fox clan's descent.

197
00:16:18,280 --> 00:16:19,882
What should we do now?

198
00:16:20,119 --> 00:16:21,642
Will Yuan Bao be okay?

199
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:29,598
The birthday banquet is in a few days.

200
00:16:29,679 --> 00:16:31,599
Cultivators from all major sects will come.

201
00:16:31,760 --> 00:16:34,239
When that time comes, we'll discuss it with them.

202
00:16:46,599 --> 00:16:47,599
Yuan Bao.

203
00:16:48,440 --> 00:16:49,440
Yuan Bao.

204
00:16:51,320 --> 00:16:52,320
Yuan Bao,

205
00:16:52,520 --> 00:16:53,762
come and have some soup.

206
00:16:59,719 --> 00:17:00,719
Come here quickly.

207
00:17:05,719 --> 00:17:08,682
I had a strange dream.

208
00:17:10,400 --> 00:17:12,160
How come I did

209
00:17:12,640 --> 00:17:14,312
such strange things with the person in my dream?

210
00:17:14,393 --> 00:17:15,952
What dream? What did you dream about?

211
00:17:17,501 --> 00:17:19,022
You wouldn't understand even if I told you.

212
00:17:19,560 --> 00:17:20,682
Why wouldn't I understand?

213
00:17:21,337 --> 00:17:23,337
By the way, how did you faint yesterday?

214
00:17:23,423 --> 00:17:24,442
You really forgot everything?

215
00:17:24,637 --> 00:17:25,637
Yes.

216
00:17:26,199 --> 00:17:28,560
Maybe I was just too sleepy,

217
00:17:28,680 --> 00:17:30,122
so I fell asleep.

218
00:17:31,119 --> 00:17:32,238
It's fine then.

219
00:17:32,319 --> 00:17:33,640
Luckily, you're safe.

220
00:17:34,058 --> 00:17:36,682
We shouldn't make Uncle Huan angry again.

221
00:17:37,439 --> 00:17:38,439
Look.

222
00:17:40,160 --> 00:17:41,479
He sent someone to watch you again.

223
00:17:41,591 --> 00:17:42,591
Forget it.

224
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:45,479
No matter what I do, my dad will be angry.

225
00:17:45,800 --> 00:17:48,202
I might as well be free and unrestrained.

226
00:17:48,695 --> 00:17:49,882
Besides,

227
00:17:50,760 --> 00:17:52,162
can he really keep me here?

228
00:17:55,400 --> 00:17:57,838
With so few people, they think they can keep me inside?

229
00:17:57,979 --> 00:17:59,219
They underestimate me.

230
00:18:02,847 --> 00:18:05,332
Why are you in such a mess?

231
00:18:05,435 --> 00:18:06,762
Let's go, hurry up.

232
00:18:07,385 --> 00:18:09,002
Yuan Bao, wait for me!

233
00:18:13,251 --> 00:18:15,602
Good!

234
00:18:19,079 --> 00:18:20,482
One more.

235
00:18:20,946 --> 00:18:22,322
Good!

236
00:18:23,760 --> 00:18:25,922
Your Highness, this is your new identity.

237
00:18:26,079 --> 00:18:27,362
You must keep it safe.

238
00:18:31,600 --> 00:18:33,279
Your Highness, you and that girl

239
00:18:33,398 --> 00:18:34,642
have already formed a karmic bond.

240
00:18:34,800 --> 00:18:37,160
Won't you consider dating her before returning to Beiming?

241
00:18:37,601 --> 00:18:39,440
Be careful. If I tell Grandmother when I get back,

242
00:18:39,880 --> 00:18:41,122
she'll skin you alive.

243
00:18:41,172 --> 00:18:42,292
My bad.

244
00:18:43,354 --> 00:18:45,375
Good!

245
00:18:52,029 --> 00:18:53,552
What a handsome young man.

246
00:18:54,049 --> 00:18:56,015
-Sir, look at me.   - He's really handsome and dashing.

247
00:18:56,040 --> 00:18:58,079
- Sir.   - He looks divine.

248
00:18:58,160 --> 00:18:59,482
What are they saying?

249
00:18:59,507 --> 00:19:01,722
They're praising your peerless beauty.

250
00:19:05,880 --> 00:19:08,362
Handmade woven bamboo hats.

251
00:19:09,359 --> 00:19:10,558
Come and take a look!

252
00:19:12,319 --> 00:19:12,965
Sir.

253
00:19:14,439 --> 00:19:16,158
- Sir, you haven't paid yet.   - Forgive him.

254
00:19:16,246 --> 00:19:17,246
It's a small mistake.

255
00:19:17,450 --> 00:19:19,242
- Your Highness.   - That's more like it.

256
00:19:21,119 --> 00:19:22,682
Yuan Bao, wait for me!

257
00:19:24,239 --> 00:19:25,637
We were just grounded.

258
00:19:25,719 --> 00:19:28,122
At least pretend to stay on the mountain for several days.

259
00:19:28,269 --> 00:19:29,279
If you keep acting like this,

260
00:19:29,360 --> 00:19:31,372
even if you had eight legs, Uncle Huan would break them all.

261
00:19:31,840 --> 00:19:33,199
- What are you afraid of?   - Gentlemen.

262
00:19:33,295 --> 00:19:35,524
We still have your two legs here, right?

263
00:19:35,605 --> 00:19:37,040
Let me tell you

264
00:19:37,239 --> 00:19:41,042
the legendary story of a cultivation family.

265
00:19:41,479 --> 00:19:43,482
Interesting. Open your mouth.

266
00:19:44,359 --> 00:19:45,922
Let's go listen to the story.

267
00:19:46,359 --> 00:19:48,598
Speaking of these aristocratic families,

268
00:19:48,679 --> 00:19:51,439
the most powerful and prestigious ones...

269
00:19:51,560 --> 00:19:54,922
- Xue Han Yu, over here.   - would be the Su and Qi families.

270
00:19:55,359 --> 00:19:59,842
The Qi Family is the family that protects Beixuan City.

271
00:20:00,466 --> 00:20:02,746
They maintain peace for hundreds of years.

272
00:20:02,919 --> 00:20:06,642
They have a daughter named Qi Yuan Bao.

273
00:20:06,723 --> 00:20:07,863
- Our story today...   - It's you.

274
00:20:07,954 --> 00:20:10,038
- is related to her.   - Keep a low profile.

275
00:20:10,119 --> 00:20:13,040
In the cultivator tournament four years ago,

276
00:20:13,159 --> 00:20:14,679
Qi Yuan Bao

277
00:20:14,959 --> 00:20:16,879
showed great mastery over Jinghong Sword.

278
00:20:17,006 --> 00:20:20,006
Wherever the sword went, it was unstoppable.

279
00:20:20,158 --> 00:20:21,398
As for Su Shen Shen,

280
00:20:21,479 --> 00:20:24,239
she used Liuli Sword.

281
00:20:24,439 --> 00:20:25,998
Both of them were skilled in martial arts.

282
00:20:26,079 --> 00:20:27,478
They fought front to back.

283
00:20:27,559 --> 00:20:30,198
The scene was stunning.

284
00:20:30,279 --> 00:20:31,879
After hundreds of rounds,

285
00:20:31,960 --> 00:20:33,199
guess what?

286
00:20:33,359 --> 00:20:35,223
- What?   - What?

287
00:20:35,719 --> 00:20:37,522
They fought to a draw.

288
00:20:37,790 --> 00:20:40,242
Mister, is this a joke?

289
00:20:40,707 --> 00:20:43,279
Who doesn't know that Qi Yuan Bao in the biggest spoiled brat

290
00:20:43,360 --> 00:20:45,322
in Beixuan City?

291
00:20:45,871 --> 00:20:47,278
- That's right.   - Exactly.

292
00:20:47,359 --> 00:20:49,602
That's hilarious.

293
00:20:50,520 --> 00:20:51,824
He's the one making things up.

294
00:20:52,001 --> 00:20:53,722
Yuan Bao, ignore him.

295
00:20:54,079 --> 00:20:57,880
Upon returning from the cultivator tournament four years ago,

296
00:20:58,032 --> 00:21:00,082
Qi Yuan Bao changed suddenly.

297
00:21:00,239 --> 00:21:01,799
She frequents casinos every day.

298
00:21:01,880 --> 00:21:06,402
Yuan Bao, what exactly happened four years ago

299
00:21:06,778 --> 00:21:08,442
that made you the way you are now?

300
00:21:08,895 --> 00:21:10,842
What's wrong with the way I am?

301
00:21:11,199 --> 00:21:12,252
That's not what I meant.

302
00:21:13,452 --> 00:21:15,675
I'm tired of cultivation.

303
00:21:16,286 --> 00:21:20,602
It's so much fun to eat, drink, and have fun like what I do now.

304
00:21:21,895 --> 00:21:23,531
No matter what, you'll always be my good cousin.

305
00:21:24,765 --> 00:21:25,884
What nonsense is this?

306
00:21:27,599 --> 00:21:29,562
Someone as useless as Qi Yuan Bao

307
00:21:29,760 --> 00:21:31,402
shouldn't be mentioned alongside my sister.

308
00:21:31,760 --> 00:21:33,762
This must be a cruel joke.

309
00:21:34,621 --> 00:21:36,518
Who is this person? She looks familiar.

310
00:21:36,599 --> 00:21:38,362
This is the Second Young Lady of the Su family.

311
00:21:39,560 --> 00:21:40,879
So, it's that feisty heiress,

312
00:21:40,996 --> 00:21:42,156
Su Qian Qian.

313
00:21:43,359 --> 00:21:44,602
This is getting interesting.

314
00:21:44,719 --> 00:21:46,362
Now there's a show to watch.

315
00:21:49,959 --> 00:21:52,879
Isn't this the Qi family's famous spoiled brat,

316
00:21:52,973 --> 00:21:54,202
Qi Yuan Bao?

317
00:21:55,079 --> 00:21:56,442
You flatter me.

318
00:21:57,000 --> 00:21:58,839
To have a draw with an imbecile like you

319
00:21:59,359 --> 00:22:01,002
is a disgrace to her entire life.

320
00:22:01,479 --> 00:22:03,000
Then you can only blame your sister.

321
00:22:03,319 --> 00:22:05,359
Who told her to be just

322
00:22:06,280 --> 00:22:07,358
as useless as me back then?

323
00:22:07,499 --> 00:22:09,402
- You!   - Listen to what she's saying!

324
00:22:09,719 --> 00:22:10,719
You have no shame.

325
00:22:10,800 --> 00:22:11,800
I...

326
00:22:17,359 --> 00:22:18,359
Forget it.

327
00:22:18,880 --> 00:22:21,682
I only yell at a human being.

328
00:22:21,950 --> 00:22:23,789
So I won't yell at you.

329
00:22:26,439 --> 00:22:27,675
She is mean.

330
00:22:27,769 --> 00:22:28,922
I know, right?

331
00:22:30,040 --> 00:22:31,840
Miss Su must have learned her lesson today.

332
00:22:31,969 --> 00:22:33,175
What are you laughing at?

333
00:22:33,359 --> 00:22:35,882
Su Qian Qian is nothing special.

334
00:22:39,292 --> 00:22:40,292
I...

335
00:22:43,258 --> 00:22:46,242
Qi Yuan Bao, your family is a well-known family.

336
00:22:46,637 --> 00:22:49,402
Your lack of manners might have come from your mother...

337
00:22:54,520 --> 00:22:55,682
Oh, I forgot.

338
00:22:55,839 --> 00:22:58,882
Your mother wasn't a good person either.

339
00:22:59,319 --> 00:23:00,722
As the sect leader's wife,

340
00:23:00,861 --> 00:23:03,025
she stooped so low as to collude with demons.

341
00:23:03,839 --> 00:23:06,239
That's why she died.

342
00:23:06,879 --> 00:23:09,238
I feel bad for you now,

343
00:23:09,412 --> 00:23:11,332
so today, I won't bicker with you.

344
00:23:11,478 --> 00:23:13,839
Su Qian Qian, hold your poisonous tongue.

345
00:23:15,691 --> 00:23:17,282
You can insult me,

346
00:23:18,319 --> 00:23:19,722
but you can't insult

347
00:23:20,798 --> 00:23:21,922
my mother.

348
00:23:25,680 --> 00:23:27,042
Young Lady.

349
00:23:31,862 --> 00:23:32,862
Let go!

350
00:23:35,720 --> 00:23:36,878
My mother was admired by many.

351
00:23:36,974 --> 00:23:38,282
She was a heroine.

352
00:23:38,520 --> 00:23:41,202
Who are you to judge her?

353
00:23:41,959 --> 00:23:42,959
Apologize to my mother,

354
00:23:43,119 --> 00:23:44,402
and I'll let this go.

355
00:23:44,560 --> 00:23:47,119
If not, you can forget about leaving this place today.

356
00:23:47,580 --> 00:23:49,922
Qi Yuan Bao, you asked for this today.

357
00:23:50,295 --> 00:23:52,322
Don't say I bully you.

358
00:24:04,160 --> 00:24:05,880
Your Highness, the book says

359
00:24:06,013 --> 00:24:08,920
that the Qishan Sect is a family of cultivators and scholars.

360
00:24:09,079 --> 00:24:10,838
So, the daughter they raised

361
00:24:10,919 --> 00:24:12,842
must be virtuous and gentle, amiable and lovely.

362
00:24:13,074 --> 00:24:15,110
It would be wonderful if Your Highness could

363
00:24:15,191 --> 00:24:17,442
write a love story with someone like her.

364
00:24:22,573 --> 00:24:24,202
This is what you mean by amiable and lovely?

365
00:24:24,428 --> 00:24:26,682
Su Qian Qian, to hell with you!

366
00:24:30,319 --> 00:24:33,882
Your Highness, forget what I just said.

367
00:24:35,685 --> 00:24:38,285
I prefer to spend this humble life alone.

368
00:25:04,327 --> 00:25:06,322
She clearly can't win, but she still wants to fight.

369
00:25:07,239 --> 00:25:09,322
Do you think we should lend a helping hand?

370
00:25:09,662 --> 00:25:10,662
None of my business.

371
00:25:10,775 --> 00:25:13,253
Qi Yuan Bao, with your current skills,

372
00:25:13,334 --> 00:25:14,454
you still want to fight me?

373
00:25:14,660 --> 00:25:15,777
Do you have a death wish?

374
00:25:15,919 --> 00:25:17,802
It's not too late to apologize now.

375
00:25:18,833 --> 00:25:19,833
Okay.

376
00:25:19,920 --> 00:25:23,882
Then today, I will show you the power of my Seven Star Whip.

377
00:25:39,176 --> 00:25:40,322
Apologize!

378
00:25:40,737 --> 00:25:41,922
I refuse.

379
00:25:42,093 --> 00:25:44,679
Qi Yuan Bao, you're insane.

380
00:25:44,760 --> 00:25:46,679
Like I said, if you don't apologize today,

381
00:25:46,760 --> 00:25:48,202
you can't leave this place.

382
00:25:59,680 --> 00:26:01,482
She's going to get hurt soon.

383
00:26:03,228 --> 00:26:04,322
You...

384
00:26:04,580 --> 00:26:05,722
Yuan Bao!

385
00:26:05,888 --> 00:26:06,888
You...

386
00:26:07,048 --> 00:26:08,048
You...

387
00:26:08,152 --> 00:26:09,362
Let go!

388
00:26:10,755 --> 00:26:13,042
Please stop fighting, you two!

389
00:26:23,760 --> 00:26:25,202
Apologize to my mother!

390
00:26:27,278 --> 00:26:28,682
Apologize to my mother!

391
00:26:30,280 --> 00:26:32,400
I'll apologize, okay?

392
00:26:32,523 --> 00:26:35,173
I'm sorry. I said I'm sorry. Let go!

393
00:26:35,254 --> 00:26:36,602
Who are you apologizing to?

394
00:26:37,159 --> 00:26:39,239
To your mother. I apologize to your mother. Happy?

395
00:26:39,359 --> 00:26:40,798
Let go! Let me go!

396
00:26:41,719 --> 00:26:42,698
Let go!

397
00:26:44,479 --> 00:26:45,762
That's more like it.

398
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:53,239
Xue Han Yu, let's go.

399
00:26:56,959 --> 00:26:57,959
Qi Yuan Bao,

400
00:26:58,119 --> 00:27:00,442
did I say you could leave now?

401
00:27:18,617 --> 00:27:19,842
My flower!
