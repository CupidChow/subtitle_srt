00:01:48,882 --> 00:01:54,005
(Dear Mr. Heavenly Fox)

2
00:01:54,103 --> 00:01:57,070
(Episode 24)

3
00:01:57,919 --> 00:01:59,467
Xue Han Yu, there's no need for this.

4
00:01:59,548 --> 00:02:00,780
I said I'm not hungry.

5
00:02:00,912 --> 00:02:01,466
No.

6
00:02:02,326 --> 00:02:03,531
- It'd pain me.   - You...

7
00:02:06,686 --> 00:02:07,505
So much food.

8
00:02:08,399 --> 00:02:09,993
I want to eat this.

9
00:02:10,360 --> 00:02:11,672
Please add more meat for me.

10
00:02:11,759 --> 00:02:12,233
Okay.

11
00:02:13,512 --> 00:02:14,139
I...

12
00:02:26,372 --> 00:02:27,096
Take it.

13
00:02:27,970 --> 00:02:28,583
Thank you.

14
00:02:30,973 --> 00:02:31,782
What do you want?

15
00:02:35,360 --> 00:02:37,119
Miss Su, why do you only have vegetables?

16
00:02:37,277 --> 00:02:38,423
Is this how you take care of her?

17
00:02:38,556 --> 00:02:40,081
Ask them to give her more meat.

18
00:02:40,215 --> 00:02:41,682
Exactly. It's all vegetables.

19
00:02:41,854 --> 00:02:43,082
It's okay.

20
00:02:43,302 --> 00:02:44,642
I can just do this.

21
00:02:50,153 --> 00:02:51,627
It's okay. I have no appetite.

22
00:02:52,239 --> 00:02:53,239
No.

23
00:02:53,360 --> 00:02:54,360
I like vegetables.

24
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:57,313
This is my first time seeing Xue

25
00:02:57,600 --> 00:02:58,679
care so much about a girl

26
00:02:58,759 --> 00:03:00,793
other than Yuan Bao.

27
00:03:01,880 --> 00:03:02,880
Exactly.

28
00:03:02,960 --> 00:03:04,880
What's gotten into Xue?

29
00:03:04,960 --> 00:03:06,392
He is so different now.

30
00:03:06,960 --> 00:03:07,960
That's right.

31
00:03:08,720 --> 00:03:09,720
Something's up.

32
00:03:10,240 --> 00:03:11,240
Stop it, you guys.

33
00:03:11,600 --> 00:03:12,600
Eat your food.

34
00:03:13,119 --> 00:03:14,119
Can't we tease you?

35
00:03:14,320 --> 00:03:15,880
Eat. Let's dig in.

36
00:03:20,240 --> 00:03:21,240
Qian Qian,

37
00:03:21,600 --> 00:03:22,172
let's eat.

38
00:03:29,520 --> 00:03:31,672
(She has always been a proud girl.)

39
00:03:31,960 --> 00:03:33,672
(If she knew she was being ostracized,)

40
00:03:34,080 --> 00:03:35,632
(she'd be crying.)

41
00:03:40,080 --> 00:03:41,313
Look at her.

42
00:03:41,960 --> 00:03:42,960
She deserves it.

43
00:03:43,240 --> 00:03:44,240
Stop.

44
00:03:46,039 --> 00:03:47,506
Mr. Xue, is something the matter?

45
00:03:49,279 --> 00:03:51,640
Who told you to put bugs

46
00:03:51,720 --> 00:03:52,720
in Su Qian Qian's food?

47
00:03:55,639 --> 00:03:56,639
What's wrong with that?

48
00:03:56,720 --> 00:03:57,920
You want to stand up for her?

49
00:03:58,000 --> 00:03:59,000
Exactly.

50
00:03:59,160 --> 00:04:01,119
She killed so many people of our sect.

51
00:04:01,199 --> 00:04:02,632
What's wrong with feeding her a few bugs?

52
00:04:02,800 --> 00:04:03,800
Exactly.

53
00:04:04,199 --> 00:04:05,353
She pays for her father's sins.

54
00:04:05,759 --> 00:04:06,832
It's just a bug.

55
00:04:07,199 --> 00:04:09,073
It's too good for that witch.

56
00:04:09,479 --> 00:04:11,552
- Who are you calling a witch?   - What's wrong with that?

57
00:04:12,119 --> 00:04:13,119
You're just a mediocre person.

58
00:04:13,320 --> 00:04:14,713
Trying to be a hero?

59
00:04:15,039 --> 00:04:16,993
- Ptooey!   - Try me.

60
00:04:35,640 --> 00:04:37,593
Don't you like feeding people bugs?

61
00:04:37,766 --> 00:04:39,633
Sure. Let me feed you.

62
00:04:40,119 --> 00:04:41,119
Come.

63
00:04:43,600 --> 00:04:45,053
- I'll feed you.   - How dare you?

64
00:04:45,720 --> 00:04:47,160
- No!   - Why not?

65
00:04:47,612 --> 00:04:49,172
Is it tasty?

66
00:04:49,667 --> 00:04:50,421
Is it good?

67
00:04:50,839 --> 00:04:51,839
It's disgusting.

68
00:04:53,359 --> 00:04:54,935
I'm warning you one last time.

69
00:04:55,519 --> 00:04:57,120
Su Qian Qian is Su Qian Qian.

70
00:04:57,200 --> 00:04:58,840
- Her father is her father.   - Right.

71
00:04:59,452 --> 00:05:00,853
If I ever see you

72
00:05:00,880 --> 00:05:01,811
bully her again,

73
00:05:01,959 --> 00:05:02,993
I'll beat you to death.

74
00:05:03,760 --> 00:05:04,792
We won't do it again.

75
00:05:05,626 --> 00:05:06,626
- We...   - Get lost!

76
00:05:09,160 --> 00:05:10,049
Let's go.

77
00:05:58,799 --> 00:06:00,199
I didn't expect Xue Han Yu

78
00:06:00,279 --> 00:06:01,952
to protect me one day.

79
00:06:31,966 --> 00:06:32,911
Xue.

80
00:06:38,279 --> 00:06:39,753
Xue, are you okay?

81
00:06:43,279 --> 00:06:44,832
Xue, don't scare me.

82
00:06:45,160 --> 00:06:46,959
You... Who hit you?

83
00:06:49,640 --> 00:06:51,352
Did you get hit in the head?

84
00:06:55,419 --> 00:06:56,177
Liu,

85
00:06:57,959 --> 00:06:59,153
feel my heart.

86
00:07:01,200 --> 00:07:02,713
Is it sick?

87
00:07:04,239 --> 00:07:05,392
Why do I feel

88
00:07:06,480 --> 00:07:07,792
like it's about to burst out?

89
00:07:09,359 --> 00:07:11,112
I am Tian.

90
00:07:14,079 --> 00:07:15,079
Could it be

91
00:07:15,279 --> 00:07:16,960
that I am as handsome as Liu?

92
00:07:17,040 --> 00:07:18,552
I am finally as famous as he is.

93
00:07:33,640 --> 00:07:35,240
Father, are you feeling better?

94
00:07:35,320 --> 00:07:36,320
I'm mostly recovered.

95
00:07:38,880 --> 00:07:40,112
Then eat something first.

96
00:07:40,399 --> 00:07:41,399
Let's eat together.

97
00:07:41,799 --> 00:07:42,799
I've already eaten.

98
00:07:44,480 --> 00:07:46,593
But I see that you've lost a lot of weight.

99
00:07:47,600 --> 00:07:49,672
What? Is Chang Yue mistreating you?

100
00:07:50,119 --> 00:07:52,079
Why would Chang Yue mistreat me?

101
00:07:52,679 --> 00:07:53,679
It's Beiming.

102
00:07:53,880 --> 00:07:55,792
Those people in Beiming only drink dew.

103
00:07:56,119 --> 00:07:57,920
Father, you also know my appetite.

104
00:07:58,000 --> 00:07:59,840
I only ate so little those days

105
00:07:59,920 --> 00:08:01,272
so of course, I lost weight.

106
00:08:03,119 --> 00:08:04,352
When we return to Qishan Sect,

107
00:08:04,720 --> 00:08:06,193
I will feed you properly.

108
00:08:12,519 --> 00:08:13,519
Father,

109
00:08:14,279 --> 00:08:15,279
I

110
00:08:15,839 --> 00:08:16,960
won't accompany you back

111
00:08:17,040 --> 00:08:18,072
to Qishan Sect.

112
00:08:21,659 --> 00:08:22,325
Why?

113
00:08:25,055 --> 00:08:27,054
I haven't returned the soul

114
00:08:27,079 --> 00:08:28,079
to Chang Yue yet.

115
00:08:32,039 --> 00:08:33,513
Then after you return it to its owner,

116
00:08:33,799 --> 00:08:34,799
come home.

117
00:08:35,440 --> 00:08:36,440
That's for sure.

118
00:08:37,479 --> 00:08:39,400
But there's one more thing, Father.

119
00:08:40,159 --> 00:08:41,592
Mother's jade pendant

120
00:08:42,080 --> 00:08:44,232
went missing inexplicably in Beiming.

121
00:08:44,359 --> 00:08:46,552
What? The Tianji Jade Pendant is lost?

122
00:08:47,280 --> 00:08:48,393
Tianji Jade Pendant?

123
00:08:51,080 --> 00:08:53,112
Father, what exactly is that?

124
00:08:53,559 --> 00:08:54,559
That is

125
00:08:59,799 --> 00:09:01,112
the magical artifact of the Xue clan

126
00:09:02,520 --> 00:09:05,073
used to fight the Corpse Puppet King.

127
00:09:05,760 --> 00:09:06,760
The Xue clan?

128
00:09:08,520 --> 00:09:09,520
My maternal family?

129
00:09:09,880 --> 00:09:10,880
Yes.

130
00:09:12,760 --> 00:09:15,200
Although the Corpse Puppet King was suppressed back then,

131
00:09:15,280 --> 00:09:17,712
his power was still strong.

132
00:09:18,119 --> 00:09:19,313
So every fifty years,

133
00:09:19,520 --> 00:09:20,520
the formation sealing him

134
00:09:20,559 --> 00:09:21,792
would loosen.

135
00:09:22,239 --> 00:09:23,800
Only the Xue clan's magical artifact,

136
00:09:23,825 --> 00:09:24,658
the Tianji Jade Pendant,

137
00:09:25,119 --> 00:09:26,472
could stabilize the formation.

138
00:09:27,400 --> 00:09:29,953
So the person I saw

139
00:09:30,239 --> 00:09:31,513
when I took the jade pendant that day

140
00:09:31,640 --> 00:09:32,672
was the Corpse Puppet King.

141
00:09:36,159 --> 00:09:38,039
Your mother's generation happened to coincide

142
00:09:38,119 --> 00:09:39,873
with the loosening of the formation.

143
00:09:40,080 --> 00:09:41,200
The Corpse Puppet King's

144
00:09:41,280 --> 00:09:42,472
demonic energy had broken free.

145
00:09:42,640 --> 00:09:43,640
At this critical moment,

146
00:09:43,960 --> 00:09:47,313
your mother and your uncle joined forces to absorb the demonic energy

147
00:09:47,719 --> 00:09:49,240
using the Tianji Jade Pendant

148
00:09:49,320 --> 00:09:50,433
and stabilized the formation.

149
00:09:52,414 --> 00:09:53,855
But your uncle and aunt

150
00:09:53,880 --> 00:09:54,880
were harmed by demons

151
00:09:55,559 --> 00:09:57,313
while saving your mother.

152
00:09:58,640 --> 00:10:00,873
Now that the Tianji Jade Pendant is lost for no reason,

153
00:10:01,960 --> 00:10:03,073
I fear that some people

154
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:05,552
with ulterior motives will abuse it.

155
00:10:06,159 --> 00:10:07,159
Then that means

156
00:10:07,559 --> 00:10:08,839
I must return to Beiming immediately

157
00:10:08,919 --> 00:10:09,953
to find the Tianji Jade Pendant.

158
00:10:13,039 --> 00:10:14,039
Yuan Bao,

159
00:10:14,359 --> 00:10:16,360
have you ever met

160
00:10:16,440 --> 00:10:17,792
a woman called Meng Shu in Beiming?

161
00:10:18,166 --> 00:10:19,413
- Meng Shu?   - Yes.

162
00:10:22,799 --> 00:10:23,799
No.

163
00:10:24,520 --> 00:10:25,520
Father,

164
00:10:25,559 --> 00:10:26,559
who is she?

165
00:10:28,679 --> 00:10:30,232
She is an old friend of mine.

166
00:10:31,520 --> 00:10:32,792
After you return to Beiming,

167
00:10:32,919 --> 00:10:34,552
you must pay close attention to this person.

168
00:10:35,679 --> 00:10:37,479
Because I suspect Su Qing Mu's Phantom Fox Darts

169
00:10:37,559 --> 00:10:38,912
were given to him by her.

170
00:10:39,919 --> 00:10:42,433
If the Tianji Jade Pendant falls into her hands,

171
00:10:42,799 --> 00:10:43,799
then things

172
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:48,112
will get out of control.

173
00:11:00,799 --> 00:11:03,393
It seems that not only have you failed to achieve the goal,

174
00:11:03,679 --> 00:11:05,552
but you've also become a hunted prey.

175
00:11:06,080 --> 00:11:07,313
You brought me here

176
00:11:07,880 --> 00:11:10,232
just to say these sarcastic remarks?

177
00:11:13,320 --> 00:11:14,320
What is this?

178
00:11:14,919 --> 00:11:16,552
You don't need to know what this is.

179
00:11:16,799 --> 00:11:17,912
You just need to know

180
00:11:18,239 --> 00:11:19,393
that this magical artifact

181
00:11:19,760 --> 00:11:21,792
contains a wisp of the Corpse Puppet King's demonic energy.

182
00:11:22,679 --> 00:11:26,193
You can use it to make thralls who serve you.

183
00:11:26,999 --> 00:11:29,421
Whether you want to capture Qi Yuan Bao for the ritual

184
00:11:29,861 --> 00:11:31,951
or seek revenge on Qi Lian,

185
00:11:32,239 --> 00:11:33,513
it will make things easier.

186
00:11:43,760 --> 00:11:44,760
Eat more.

187
00:11:45,119 --> 00:11:46,193
It is good for your health.

188
00:11:46,879 --> 00:11:48,273
And this too. It is also delicious.

189
00:11:48,440 --> 00:11:49,440
Eat more.

190
00:11:50,159 --> 00:11:51,159
And this

191
00:11:51,679 --> 00:11:52,679
is also very delicious.

192
00:11:54,919 --> 00:11:56,079
- I don't want it.   - Eat it.

193
00:11:56,159 --> 00:11:56,798
I don't need it.

194
00:11:57,760 --> 00:11:59,392
- And this.   - By the way, Chang Yue,

195
00:11:59,679 --> 00:12:01,112
have you ever heard

196
00:12:01,280 --> 00:12:02,993
of a person called Meng Shu?

197
00:12:04,119 --> 00:12:05,119
Meng Shu?

198
00:12:06,479 --> 00:12:07,479
I've never heard of her.

199
00:12:07,746 --> 00:12:08,385
Who is she?

200
00:12:08,919 --> 00:12:09,919
It's a long story.

201
00:12:10,375 --> 00:12:11,894
Once we return to Beiming,

202
00:12:11,971 --> 00:12:12,919
we investigate thoroughly.

203
00:12:13,973 --> 00:12:15,966
What? You're going to Beiming?

204
00:12:17,760 --> 00:12:18,384
I want to go too!

205
00:12:19,400 --> 00:12:20,719
Don't meddle in it.

206
00:12:20,799 --> 00:12:21,993
Besides, if you come with me,

207
00:12:23,520 --> 00:12:24,672
what about Su Qian Qian?

208
00:12:40,640 --> 00:12:41,993
Why are you two blushing?

209
00:12:43,159 --> 00:12:44,159
No, we aren't.

210
00:12:45,559 --> 00:12:46,559
You...

211
00:12:49,682 --> 00:12:50,842
You're hiding something from me.

212
00:12:50,922 --> 00:12:52,986
Chang Yue, I told you. They're hiding something from me.

213
00:12:53,359 --> 00:12:54,359
Just eat your food.

214
00:12:57,919 --> 00:12:59,513
You two there...

215
00:13:03,320 --> 00:13:05,513
Indeed, where there's Yuan Bao,

216
00:13:05,719 --> 00:13:06,753
there's joy.

217
00:13:08,586 --> 00:13:10,873
If they could be this happy every day,

218
00:13:11,775 --> 00:13:12,878
that would be wonderful.

219
00:13:19,320 --> 00:13:20,592
Master.

220
00:13:21,559 --> 00:13:22,672
We haven't found Su Qing Mu.

221
00:13:30,072 --> 00:13:31,664
Expand the search area and keep looking.

222
00:13:31,880 --> 00:13:32,373
Noted.

223
00:13:45,719 --> 00:13:46,719
It'll be all right.

224
00:14:04,719 --> 00:14:05,719
Split into two teams.

225
00:14:05,840 --> 00:14:06,840
One team goes there,

226
00:14:07,080 --> 00:14:08,232
One team goes to the other side.

227
00:14:26,219 --> 00:14:27,219
Wait.

228
00:14:28,440 --> 00:14:29,440
You wicked creature.

229
00:14:29,880 --> 00:14:31,633
You're at your wits' end.

230
00:14:31,880 --> 00:14:33,719
You're about to die. What else do you want to say?

231
00:14:33,960 --> 00:14:34,993
Do you want

232
00:14:35,919 --> 00:14:38,193
to take revenge on Qi Yuan Bao and Chang Yue?

233
00:14:38,840 --> 00:14:40,633
Chang Yue has stolen your wife.

234
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:42,073
Are you going to

235
00:14:42,359 --> 00:14:44,232
be as cowardly as your father

236
00:14:44,479 --> 00:14:45,719
and let them go?

237
00:14:45,799 --> 00:14:46,799
What?

238
00:14:47,119 --> 00:14:48,433
Am I wrong?

239
00:14:48,719 --> 00:14:50,433
Qi Yuan Bao publicly broke off the marriage.

240
00:14:50,599 --> 00:14:52,433
She has no care for your feelings,

241
00:14:52,640 --> 00:14:54,912
and appears with Chang Yue in pairs.

242
00:14:55,080 --> 00:14:57,152
She turns you into the laughingstock among our peers.

243
00:14:57,359 --> 00:14:59,079
And now you're a scaredy cat,

244
00:14:59,159 --> 00:15:00,273
too afraid to deal with them.

245
00:15:02,299 --> 00:15:03,453
I see.

246
00:15:05,280 --> 00:15:07,112
With your cultivation level,

247
00:15:07,599 --> 00:15:09,313
you can't even do anything to Qi Yuan Bao,

248
00:15:09,640 --> 00:15:12,073
let alone Chang Yue.

249
00:15:12,375 --> 00:15:13,735
I can kill you right now.

250
00:15:13,760 --> 00:15:14,472
Wait.

251
00:15:15,719 --> 00:15:17,712
Anyone can kill me now.

252
00:15:18,080 --> 00:15:20,193
But if you don't kill me today,

253
00:15:21,200 --> 00:15:22,200
in the future,

254
00:15:22,479 --> 00:15:25,273
I'll help you kill Qi Yuan Bao and Chang Yue.

255
00:15:26,919 --> 00:15:28,672
With what? Your weakened state?

256
00:15:29,273 --> 00:15:30,545
I can't kill them right now,

257
00:15:31,039 --> 00:15:33,313
but the thralls I have can.

258
00:15:34,119 --> 00:15:35,119
Thralls?

259
00:16:30,919 --> 00:16:31,919
Come.

260
00:16:45,520 --> 00:16:46,520
Huo Shu Ya.

261
00:16:49,753 --> 00:16:51,080
Yuan Bao, what's the matter?

262
00:16:51,599 --> 00:16:53,592
It's so late. Are you going out still?

263
00:16:55,200 --> 00:16:56,200
What about you and him?

264
00:16:56,400 --> 00:16:58,080
Isn't it late for you two to still be outside?

265
00:17:33,199 --> 00:17:34,199
Mr. Huo,

266
00:17:34,359 --> 00:17:35,913
such self-restraint.

267
00:17:37,959 --> 00:17:39,312
If you want to live, shut your mouth.

268
00:17:39,680 --> 00:17:41,200
Listen. Everyone is looking for you now.

269
00:17:41,280 --> 00:17:42,592
This is the safest place.

270
00:17:43,079 --> 00:17:45,192
Stay here and don't cause me any trouble.

271
00:17:45,800 --> 00:17:48,033
Then I must thank you.

272
00:17:50,239 --> 00:17:51,352
How exactly were those thralls

273
00:17:51,640 --> 00:17:52,873
made today?

274
00:17:53,520 --> 00:17:54,520
Don't worry.

275
00:17:55,040 --> 00:17:56,513
I'll teach you once I recover

276
00:17:56,920 --> 00:17:58,513
from my injuries.

277
00:18:12,880 --> 00:18:15,513
Father, is there any news of Su Qing Mu?

278
00:18:16,239 --> 00:18:17,239
Not yet.

279
00:18:19,520 --> 00:18:21,673
By right, he's seriously injured

280
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:23,345
and shouldn't be able to run far.

281
00:18:24,119 --> 00:18:25,119
Don't worry,

282
00:18:25,359 --> 00:18:26,673
I've already dispatched more people.

283
00:18:27,079 --> 00:18:28,192
We'll definitely catch him.

284
00:18:29,760 --> 00:18:30,760
It's you

285
00:18:31,079 --> 00:18:32,232
who needs to be careful

286
00:18:32,560 --> 00:18:34,153
in case he harms you again.

287
00:18:34,680 --> 00:18:36,269
Don't worry, Father. I will be careful.

288
00:18:37,414 --> 00:18:39,334
Young Master's appetite has been

289
00:18:39,359 --> 00:18:40,359
really good lately.

290
00:18:40,439 --> 00:18:41,753
He eats a lot.

291
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:42,681
That's right.

292
00:18:45,160 --> 00:18:46,160
What's wrong?

293
00:18:47,599 --> 00:18:48,599
Nothing.

294
00:19:11,839 --> 00:19:13,432
Your wound is bleeding again.

295
00:19:17,760 --> 00:19:19,592
It's been so long and it's not getting better.

296
00:19:20,079 --> 00:19:21,753
Should I get some medicine and dress it for you?

297
00:19:22,599 --> 00:19:23,599
No need.

298
00:19:26,359 --> 00:19:27,359
How did you get your injury

299
00:19:28,119 --> 00:19:29,273
anyway?

300
00:19:29,839 --> 00:19:30,839
I remember that day,

301
00:19:31,359 --> 00:19:32,913
you weren't injured.

302
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:39,592
You must be mistaken.

303
00:19:40,119 --> 00:19:41,119
Is that so?

304
00:19:46,040 --> 00:19:47,840
I think your body has recovered

305
00:19:47,920 --> 00:19:48,920
almost completely.

306
00:19:49,800 --> 00:19:51,879
Can you teach me

307
00:19:51,959 --> 00:19:53,352
the method of making thralls now?

308
00:19:57,599 --> 00:19:59,993
Haste makes waste.

309
00:20:00,359 --> 00:20:02,112
My spiritual power is damaged now,

310
00:20:03,599 --> 00:20:05,312
so I can't teach you for the time being.

311
00:20:25,439 --> 00:20:26,480
(If I continue to harbor him,)

312
00:20:26,560 --> 00:20:27,993
(it will be exposed sooner or later.)

313
00:20:29,319 --> 00:20:31,352
(Besides, when he truly recovers,)

314
00:20:31,839 --> 00:20:33,432
(he won't fear me anymore.)

315
00:20:36,040 --> 00:20:37,952
(What a strange injury.)

316
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:40,952
(Could it be that the artifact for making thralls)

317
00:20:41,760 --> 00:20:42,793
(is hidden there?)

318
00:21:20,199 --> 00:21:21,273
What are you looking for?

319
00:21:22,199 --> 00:21:23,952
Give me the artifact now

320
00:21:24,520 --> 00:21:26,352
and maybe, I can spare your life.

321
00:21:27,119 --> 00:21:29,352
I know you are ambitious,

322
00:21:30,359 --> 00:21:32,712
but I didn't expect you to be so impatient.

323
00:21:33,599 --> 00:21:35,352
Either give me the artifact now,

324
00:21:35,599 --> 00:21:38,033
or die.

325
00:21:41,239 --> 00:21:42,239
Huo Shu Ya,

326
00:21:42,920 --> 00:21:44,312
think carefully.

327
00:21:46,040 --> 00:21:47,753
If you kill me here

328
00:21:48,719 --> 00:21:50,273
and make a noise,

329
00:21:51,560 --> 00:21:53,673
when the other cultivators come,

330
00:21:53,800 --> 00:21:55,753
will the artifact still be yours?

331
00:21:56,466 --> 00:21:57,699
If I were you,

332
00:21:58,800 --> 00:22:01,273
I would put away those thoughts.

333
00:22:44,011 --> 00:22:45,504
- Father.   - Shu Ya.

334
00:22:46,040 --> 00:22:47,800
Why is he in your room?

335
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:49,680
I didn't know he was here either.

336
00:22:49,959 --> 00:22:51,352
I almost fell for his trick.

337
00:22:53,079 --> 00:22:55,232
Father, inform the others.

338
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:22,000
Shu Ya.

339
00:23:23,760 --> 00:23:25,112
Shu Ya, are you all right?

340
00:23:25,479 --> 00:23:26,479
I'm fine.

341
00:23:38,839 --> 00:23:40,839
Yuan Bao, what did you find?

342
00:23:47,400 --> 00:23:49,312
I just think this wound is very strange.

343
00:23:49,599 --> 00:23:51,352
It doesn't look like it was stabbed open,

344
00:23:51,520 --> 00:23:52,913
but rather gouged open.

345
00:24:00,599 --> 00:24:02,153
He went into hiding.

346
00:24:02,439 --> 00:24:04,072
He was most likely injured by someone.

347
00:24:09,760 --> 00:24:10,760
Ru Hua.

348
00:24:11,599 --> 00:24:13,999
- Yes, sir?   - Take Su Qing Mu's body away

349
00:24:14,079 --> 00:24:15,079
and bury him properly.

350
00:24:15,239 --> 00:24:16,239
Noted.

351
00:24:28,880 --> 00:24:29,880
Come on. Steady.

352
00:24:30,160 --> 00:24:31,160
Be careful.

353
00:24:32,239 --> 00:24:33,239
Watch the steps.

354
00:24:33,400 --> 00:24:35,153
Su Qing Mu really deserved to die.

355
00:24:36,106 --> 00:24:37,106
Tian,

356
00:24:38,118 --> 00:24:39,231
can I take a look?

357
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:40,518
Go ahead.

358
00:24:49,920 --> 00:24:51,312
Please keep this a secret.

359
00:24:51,920 --> 00:24:53,072
Don't tell Qian Qian.

360
00:24:53,959 --> 00:24:56,072
Don't worry, we won't tell her.

361
00:24:57,399 --> 00:24:57,912
Let's go.

362
00:26:05,119 --> 00:26:06,119
(It's so late now.)

363
00:26:06,280 --> 00:26:07,673
(Where is Shu Ya going?)

364
00:26:24,359 --> 00:26:25,359
Father?

365
00:26:27,280 --> 00:26:29,232
Father, give me the jade pendant.

366
00:26:30,199 --> 00:26:31,199
Give it back to you

367
00:26:31,880 --> 00:26:34,033
so you can make more thralls?

368
00:26:35,479 --> 00:26:37,400
I can't watch you go astray.

369
00:26:37,560 --> 00:26:38,560
Father,

370
00:26:39,119 --> 00:26:41,673
I'm doing this to get rid of the fox demon and Beiming.

371
00:26:41,923 --> 00:26:43,560
I can't let them invade the mortal realm.

372
00:26:43,717 --> 00:26:45,042
How dare you lie to me?

373
00:26:45,400 --> 00:26:47,322
You know Yuan Bao is in Beiming.

374
00:26:47,719 --> 00:26:49,142
You're making thralls

375
00:26:49,400 --> 00:26:51,362
to force her out of Beiming

376
00:26:51,711 --> 00:26:53,503
and to sacrifice her at Suiyue Mountain.

377
00:26:55,239 --> 00:26:57,153
I'm so disappointed in you.

378
00:26:58,400 --> 00:27:00,432
To gain the power of the Corpse Puppet King,

379
00:27:00,719 --> 00:27:03,232
you do anything and harm innocent people.

380
00:27:04,119 --> 00:27:05,320
The Huo family

381
00:27:05,400 --> 00:27:06,560
will be condemned and loathed

382
00:27:06,640 --> 00:27:08,072
by everyone!

383
00:27:09,319 --> 00:27:11,232
When I pass away,

384
00:27:11,839 --> 00:27:15,153
how am I supposed to answer to our ancestors?

385
00:27:17,000 --> 00:27:18,000
Father.

386
00:27:18,239 --> 00:27:19,760
- I...   - Back then,

387
00:27:21,880 --> 00:27:25,202
if I hadn't helped you frame Chang Yue,

388
00:27:25,462 --> 00:27:28,042
you wouldn't have fallen this far

389
00:27:28,680 --> 00:27:30,602
into obsession.

390
00:27:31,880 --> 00:27:33,325
Father, I...

391
00:27:33,719 --> 00:27:35,021
Shu Ya,

392
00:27:35,182 --> 00:27:37,042
come back to us.

393
00:27:37,239 --> 00:27:39,562
Stop it. There's still time.

394
00:27:40,280 --> 00:27:42,432
I can't watch you

395
00:27:43,239 --> 00:27:45,042
make any more mistakes.

396
00:27:51,319 --> 00:27:52,319
Father,

397
00:27:52,760 --> 00:27:54,122
I'm sorry.

398
00:27:55,199 --> 00:27:56,513
I made a mistake.

399
00:27:57,040 --> 00:27:58,192
To err is human,

400
00:27:58,880 --> 00:28:00,153
to forgive, divine.

401
00:28:00,839 --> 00:28:02,072
To err is human, to forgive, divine.

402
00:28:03,880 --> 00:28:05,200
I will destroy this harmful thing

403
00:28:05,280 --> 00:28:06,280
right now.

404
00:28:06,400 --> 00:28:07,553
Kill yourself.

405
00:28:10,959 --> 00:28:11,959
Then I'll take you

406
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:13,192
to apologize to everyone.

407
00:28:27,479 --> 00:28:28,479
Father,

408
00:28:29,640 --> 00:28:30,952
at this point,

409
00:28:32,119 --> 00:28:33,553
there's no turning back.

410
00:28:33,760 --> 00:28:36,542
- But I'm your father.   - Shut up!

411
00:28:37,839 --> 00:28:39,273
When you killed my mother,

412
00:28:40,640 --> 00:28:42,010
did you ever think

413
00:28:42,780 --> 00:28:44,300
she was your wife?

414
00:28:44,381 --> 00:28:45,381
You...

415
00:29:00,092 --> 00:29:01,092
Huo Shu Ya!

416
00:29:10,085 --> 00:29:11,085
Mr. Huo.

417
00:29:12,040 --> 00:29:13,192
Are you okay?

418
00:29:13,479 --> 00:29:15,119
Huo, what happened?

419
00:29:15,319 --> 00:29:17,040
- Give chase.   - No need.

420
00:29:17,880 --> 00:29:19,832
I'm severing all ties with that man.

421
00:29:21,359 --> 00:29:22,712
I'm disowning him.

422
00:29:42,160 --> 00:29:43,712
I don't understand.

423
00:29:43,839 --> 00:29:44,873
Why did Huo Shu Ya

424
00:29:45,160 --> 00:29:46,633
become like this?

425
00:29:46,920 --> 00:29:48,352
This is his family matter.

426
00:29:48,479 --> 00:29:50,513
Outsiders like us can't interfere.

427
00:29:51,079 --> 00:29:52,159
After you return the soul,

428
00:29:52,239 --> 00:29:53,273
come back quickly.

429
00:29:54,640 --> 00:29:55,640
Oh, Yuan Bao.

430
00:29:56,119 --> 00:29:57,592
The world outside is not like Qishan Sect,

431
00:29:57,719 --> 00:29:59,232
You must be careful.

432
00:29:59,640 --> 00:30:00,712
In Beiming,

433
00:30:00,959 --> 00:30:02,432
don't be willful and reckless.

434
00:30:02,640 --> 00:30:03,640
Take care of yourself.

435
00:30:04,319 --> 00:30:05,319
I know, Father.

436
00:30:06,079 --> 00:30:07,553
- And...   - And what?

437
00:30:07,719 --> 00:30:08,720
If you keep nagging,

438
00:30:08,800 --> 00:30:09,800
my ears

439
00:30:09,839 --> 00:30:11,153
will fall off.

440
00:30:11,319 --> 00:30:12,319
You...

441
00:30:12,439 --> 00:30:13,439
Sect Leader Qi, don't worry.

442
00:30:13,640 --> 00:30:14,712
I will take care of Yuan Bao.

443
00:30:15,880 --> 00:30:16,880
Also, Father,

444
00:30:17,119 --> 00:30:18,873
don't just worry about me.

445
00:30:19,079 --> 00:30:20,153
When I'm not by your side,

446
00:30:20,359 --> 00:30:21,800
you also need to take care

447
00:30:21,880 --> 00:30:22,592
of your own health, okay?

448
00:30:24,040 --> 00:30:25,359
You're lecturing your father now?

449
00:30:25,439 --> 00:30:27,039
I'm just worried about you.

450
00:30:27,064 --> 00:30:27,570
Let's go.

451
00:30:29,792 --> 00:30:30,792
Let's go.

452
00:30:36,239 --> 00:30:37,239
So

453
00:30:37,880 --> 00:30:39,880
I'm going back to Qishan Sect with my uncle.

454
00:30:41,000 --> 00:30:42,072
What are your plans?

455
00:30:45,800 --> 00:30:47,633
The whole thing happened so suddenly.

456
00:30:48,800 --> 00:30:49,832
I don't know yet.

457
00:30:51,079 --> 00:30:52,633
Then come to Qishan Sect with me.

458
00:30:55,439 --> 00:30:57,320
Although I know Beixuan City

459
00:30:57,400 --> 00:30:59,273
is not as good as Suyun City,

460
00:30:59,719 --> 00:31:01,192
there are many fun things nevertheless.

461
00:31:01,599 --> 00:31:03,320
I promise you that if you come with me,

462
00:31:03,400 --> 00:31:04,592
I'll hang out with you every day.

463
00:31:05,359 --> 00:31:06,359
You'll never be bored.

464
00:31:09,359 --> 00:31:10,393
I don't need that anyway.

465
00:31:14,359 --> 00:31:15,359
Okay.

466
00:31:41,760 --> 00:31:42,760
I found it!

467
00:31:43,400 --> 00:31:44,432
I found it!

468
00:31:44,760 --> 00:31:45,760
I found it.

469
00:31:45,880 --> 00:31:47,162
Where did you find it?

470
00:31:47,279 --> 00:31:48,602
In my room.

471
00:31:49,280 --> 00:31:51,530
To succeed the in-tandem cultivation,

472
00:31:51,642 --> 00:31:53,459
one must first starve.

473
00:31:56,800 --> 00:31:58,713
It's decided then. From today onward,

474
00:31:58,793 --> 00:32:00,345
I'll fast.

475
00:32:01,606 --> 00:32:03,046
- Are you sure?   - Yes.

476
00:32:04,880 --> 00:32:05,880
In that case,

477
00:32:06,880 --> 00:32:07,880
I'll join you.

478
00:32:14,439 --> 00:32:15,673
Let the fasting begin!

479
00:32:41,640 --> 00:32:43,600
Chang Yue, how long has it been?

480
00:32:43,680 --> 00:32:45,873
An hour, right?

481
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:49,000
Are you already hungry?

482
00:32:49,439 --> 00:32:50,439
Not hungry.

483
00:32:50,520 --> 00:32:51,520
I can handle it.

484
00:32:52,119 --> 00:32:53,119
Do you want a steamed bun?

485
00:32:53,199 --> 00:32:54,199
No.

486
00:32:54,439 --> 00:32:56,472
I am a woman of my word.

487
00:32:56,680 --> 00:32:57,759
I'm willing

488
00:32:57,839 --> 00:32:59,312
to starve to death for you.

489
00:32:59,640 --> 00:33:00,640
I...

490
00:33:08,239 --> 00:33:09,239
It's so yummy.

491
00:33:22,520 --> 00:33:24,119
I've read all the ancient tomes,

492
00:33:24,199 --> 00:33:25,320
flipped through every page,

493
00:33:25,400 --> 00:33:26,480
and tried all the methods.

494
00:33:26,560 --> 00:33:28,232
Why is it still not working at all?

495
00:33:28,959 --> 00:33:30,072
There must be other methods.

496
00:33:30,919 --> 00:33:31,919
Are all Beiming ancient tomes

497
00:33:31,959 --> 00:33:32,959
here?

498
00:33:38,352 --> 00:33:40,119
Not really. There's another place.

499
00:33:40,199 --> 00:33:41,199
Where is it?
