00:01:48,864 --> 00:01:53,985
(Dear Mr. Heavenly Fox)

2
00:01:54,065 --> 00:01:57,014
(Episode 6)

3
00:01:59,249 --> 00:02:00,332
Hurry, Qian Qian.

4
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:04,751
Shen Shen. Wait a minute.

5
00:02:04,959 --> 00:02:06,640
Qi Yuan Bao's disappearance is not our business.

6
00:02:06,728 --> 00:02:08,464
- Why are we following him?   - Enough.

7
00:02:08,960 --> 00:02:11,213
- Just follow him. Let's go!   - But...

8
00:02:13,873 --> 00:02:15,073
Here. Is it good?

9
00:02:15,160 --> 00:02:15,707
Take it.

10
00:02:19,694 --> 00:02:20,717
Master,

11
00:02:20,839 --> 00:02:22,983
the snacks here are not bad.

12
00:02:23,082 --> 00:02:24,404
Aren't you going to try some?

13
00:02:24,880 --> 00:02:25,903
No need.

14
00:02:26,880 --> 00:02:30,319
I bought this with your hard-earned money.

15
00:02:30,399 --> 00:02:31,722
Are you sure?

16
00:02:32,928 --> 00:02:34,567
If you don't want to eat, then don't eat.

17
00:02:34,679 --> 00:02:36,002
Then...

18
00:02:36,639 --> 00:02:37,688
I'll go somewhere first.

19
00:02:37,769 --> 00:02:38,922
Wait for me.

20
00:02:39,039 --> 00:02:41,082
Be patient. I'll be back.

21
00:02:48,479 --> 00:02:49,969
Your Highness.

22
00:03:01,424 --> 00:03:03,682
Your Highness, where have you gone?

23
00:03:03,800 --> 00:03:06,482
The entire Qishan Sect left to look for you.

24
00:03:06,839 --> 00:03:08,162
Don't worry about me.

25
00:03:08,360 --> 00:03:10,282
I have something to tell you.

26
00:03:10,399 --> 00:03:11,842
What is it? Tell me.

27
00:03:12,128 --> 00:03:13,167
I have already kissed Yuan Bao,

28
00:03:13,279 --> 00:03:14,892
but nothing happened to my soul.

29
00:03:15,101 --> 00:03:16,202
If you have kissed her,

30
00:03:16,399 --> 00:03:17,762
it shouldn't be like this.

31
00:03:18,196 --> 00:03:20,162
Perhaps you didn't use the right technique?

32
00:03:20,343 --> 00:03:21,642
What exactly happened?

33
00:03:21,799 --> 00:03:23,242
Tell me quickly!

34
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:34,369
What is this, Your Highness?

35
00:03:34,574 --> 00:03:36,130
Is this a joke?

36
00:03:37,936 --> 00:03:38,936
What?

37
00:03:39,040 --> 00:03:41,640
Your Highness, a kiss like that has no passion.

38
00:03:41,742 --> 00:03:43,202
You won't extract your soul at all.

39
00:03:43,374 --> 00:03:45,742
Your Highness, you have a long way to go.

40
00:03:57,360 --> 00:03:58,383
Master.

41
00:04:00,336 --> 00:04:01,336
Master,

42
00:04:01,479 --> 00:04:02,842
Shen sent a message saying

43
00:04:02,960 --> 00:04:05,002
that Qi Yuan Bao had left the mountain.

44
00:04:07,639 --> 00:04:08,662
Okay.

45
00:04:09,320 --> 00:04:10,343
Go

46
00:04:10,960 --> 00:04:12,162
and bring her to me.

47
00:04:12,360 --> 00:04:13,383
Noted.

48
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:23,879
Yue Niang, you know many things and are well-versed

49
00:04:23,974 --> 00:04:25,722
about the martial arts world.

50
00:04:25,920 --> 00:04:27,922
Do you recognize this thing?

51
00:04:28,600 --> 00:04:31,122
If you want to know more about it,

52
00:04:31,399 --> 00:04:33,842
I am afraid you have to go to Suiyue Mountain.

53
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:35,442
Suiyue Mountain?

54
00:04:37,720 --> 00:04:40,122
(Shu Ya and the others went to Suiyue Mountain.)

55
00:04:40,279 --> 00:04:42,042
(What does that place hide?)

56
00:04:44,239 --> 00:04:47,002
If I go to Suiyue Mountain, who should I ask?

57
00:04:48,559 --> 00:04:50,922
That's all I can tell you.

58
00:04:51,273 --> 00:04:52,489
Young Lady Qi,

59
00:04:52,959 --> 00:04:54,602
heed my advice.

60
00:04:54,920 --> 00:04:57,688
This thing is not an auspicious object.

61
00:04:58,359 --> 00:04:59,642
If I were you,

62
00:04:59,857 --> 00:05:01,762
I would think twice before going.

63
00:05:02,200 --> 00:05:05,368
But I believe nothing ventured, nothing gained.

64
00:05:07,119 --> 00:05:07,848
Thank you anyway.

65
00:05:15,200 --> 00:05:16,223
Aunt.

66
00:05:43,119 --> 00:05:45,922
Is he truly that chaste or is he pretending to be one?

67
00:05:47,279 --> 00:05:48,302
Whatever.

68
00:05:48,760 --> 00:05:50,162
I have something to do now.

69
00:05:50,318 --> 00:05:51,722
I have no time for you.

70
00:05:55,359 --> 00:05:56,848
Uncle Qi.

71
00:06:00,600 --> 00:06:02,116
Come and play.

72
00:06:02,920 --> 00:06:05,122
Yuan Bao often comes here to watch plays

73
00:06:05,279 --> 00:06:06,602
and learn about history.

74
00:06:10,279 --> 00:06:11,682
Uncle Qi.

75
00:06:11,807 --> 00:06:13,314
Uncle Qi.

76
00:06:17,600 --> 00:06:20,240
- Don't be shy.   - Come, mister.

77
00:06:20,320 --> 00:06:21,722
Come.

78
00:06:37,079 --> 00:06:38,602
Suiyue Mountain.

79
00:06:40,640 --> 00:06:43,802
So, is it only by going to Suiyue Mountain

80
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:45,362
that I can find out

81
00:06:45,519 --> 00:06:47,682
why my father severed my spirit root back then?

82
00:06:49,200 --> 00:06:50,842
Will it explain

83
00:06:51,440 --> 00:06:52,882
why Mother died?

84
00:06:58,359 --> 00:06:59,382
You...

85
00:07:02,320 --> 00:07:03,882
We have left the sect for four hours.

86
00:07:04,200 --> 00:07:05,248
It is time to go back.

87
00:07:05,440 --> 00:07:06,503
And if I refuse to go back?

88
00:07:07,359 --> 00:07:08,882
I brought you down the mountain.

89
00:07:09,200 --> 00:07:10,329
I must take you back.

90
00:07:15,606 --> 00:07:16,848
Do not resist needlessly.

91
00:07:17,239 --> 00:07:18,442
I do not want to hurt you.

92
00:07:20,545 --> 00:07:23,736
Chang Yue, stop me if you want. I am leaving.

93
00:07:23,880 --> 00:07:25,330
Your current situation is dangerous.

94
00:07:25,519 --> 00:07:26,216
I am not afraid.

95
00:07:26,640 --> 00:07:27,922
There is a question in my heart,

96
00:07:28,119 --> 00:07:29,602
and I must solve it.

97
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:31,568
Even if it means I'll die,

98
00:07:31,760 --> 00:07:32,592
I need an answer.

99
00:07:35,200 --> 00:07:36,078
Yuan Bao!

100
00:07:37,480 --> 00:07:38,681
- Yuan Bao!   - Yuan Bao!

101
00:07:38,761 --> 00:07:40,842
- Yuan Bao!   - Yuan Bao!

102
00:07:41,920 --> 00:07:43,159
- Yuan Bao!   - Over there.

103
00:07:43,239 --> 00:07:44,520
- Yuan Bao!   - Master,

104
00:07:44,600 --> 00:07:46,322
Yuan Bao is over there.

105
00:07:47,440 --> 00:07:49,122
- Give chase.   - Noted.

106
00:08:07,200 --> 00:08:09,762
They should not be able to find us for a while.

107
00:08:10,959 --> 00:08:13,120
Weren't you insisting on bringing me back to Qishan Sect?

108
00:08:13,239 --> 00:08:14,802
Why are you helping me?

109
00:08:15,480 --> 00:08:16,503
Maybe

110
00:08:19,320 --> 00:08:20,343
I was wrong.

111
00:08:23,880 --> 00:08:26,242
At this point, there's no turning back.

112
00:08:28,399 --> 00:08:30,682
Where will you find your answer now?

113
00:08:31,839 --> 00:08:33,642
I know where to go.

114
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:35,023
No need to follow me.

115
00:08:35,159 --> 00:08:36,482
I can go by myself.

116
00:08:46,799 --> 00:08:47,822
Yuan Bao!

117
00:08:47,927 --> 00:08:50,777
- Yuan Bao!   - Yuan Bao!

118
00:08:51,599 --> 00:08:53,120
- Yuan Bao!   - Yuan Bao!

119
00:08:53,200 --> 00:08:54,522
Yuan Bao!

120
00:08:54,799 --> 00:08:55,822
Yuan Bao!

121
00:08:57,679 --> 00:08:59,456
- Yuan Bao!   - Yuan Bao!

122
00:08:59,679 --> 00:09:01,159
- Sir.   - Yuan Bao!

123
00:09:01,262 --> 00:09:02,540
This forest is quite strange.

124
00:09:02,679 --> 00:09:04,642
Could Young Lady have entered this forest?

125
00:09:06,119 --> 00:09:07,599
- Let's go in and take a look.   - Okay.

126
00:09:07,679 --> 00:09:08,962
Let's go.

127
00:09:09,400 --> 00:09:10,423
Young Lady

128
00:09:10,599 --> 00:09:12,522
- Yuan Bao!   - Yuan Bao!

129
00:09:12,640 --> 00:09:14,120
- Yuan Bao!   - Young Lady!

130
00:09:14,200 --> 00:09:15,442
Yuan Bao!

131
00:09:17,679 --> 00:09:18,928
You're so clumsy.

132
00:09:19,039 --> 00:09:20,482
You can trip on something flat.

133
00:09:21,976 --> 00:09:23,296
- Yuan Bao!   - Shen Shen, look at him.

134
00:09:23,400 --> 00:09:26,362
Beg me and I just might help you get up.

135
00:09:27,080 --> 00:09:28,103
Young Lady!

136
00:09:28,238 --> 00:09:29,562
Yuan Bao!

137
00:09:29,719 --> 00:09:31,202
Yuan Bao!

138
00:09:31,760 --> 00:09:33,402
- Yuan Bao!   - Young Lady!

139
00:09:36,880 --> 00:09:38,670
- Are you happy now?   - Yes, I am.

140
00:09:40,057 --> 00:09:40,770
Is it very funny?

141
00:09:41,440 --> 00:09:42,560
Someone as useless as you

142
00:09:42,640 --> 00:09:44,320
should just stay at home.

143
00:09:44,423 --> 00:09:45,642
You're embarrassing yourself.

144
00:09:45,719 --> 00:09:46,808
- Yuan Bao!   - Shen Shen!

145
00:09:47,960 --> 00:09:49,329
Yuan Bao!

146
00:09:50,119 --> 00:09:51,209
Yuan Bao!

147
00:09:52,809 --> 00:09:54,322
Yuan Bao!

148
00:09:56,320 --> 00:09:58,248
Shen Shen, wait for me!

149
00:09:59,880 --> 00:10:01,128
What is this place?

150
00:10:01,280 --> 00:10:02,303
Seriously.

151
00:10:02,840 --> 00:10:03,863
What is it? Are you tired?

152
00:10:03,960 --> 00:10:05,808
I am tired. Shen Shen, let's go back.

153
00:10:05,919 --> 00:10:07,360
This has nothing to do with us.

154
00:10:07,440 --> 00:10:09,402
- We cannot find her anyway.   - Stop it.

155
00:10:10,246 --> 00:10:12,082
Won't you wait for Mr. Xue there?

156
00:10:12,479 --> 00:10:14,079
He seems to have been scratched by a vine.

157
00:10:14,159 --> 00:10:15,362
Take care of him.

158
00:10:15,443 --> 00:10:17,642
He is so clumsy. He deserves it.

159
00:10:17,919 --> 00:10:19,362
Why should I care about him?

160
00:10:20,640 --> 00:10:21,663
Su Qian Qian,

161
00:10:21,962 --> 00:10:23,402
who did you just call clumsy?

162
00:10:23,960 --> 00:10:25,562
You. Who else?

163
00:10:26,520 --> 00:10:28,442
- Let's go.   - You are the clumsy one.

164
00:10:29,359 --> 00:10:30,360
Xue Han Yu!

165
00:10:30,440 --> 00:10:31,842
Unbelievable!

166
00:10:46,840 --> 00:10:48,642
So? Did you find anything?

167
00:10:49,416 --> 00:10:50,776
We searched the entire mountain

168
00:10:50,880 --> 00:10:52,122
without Qi Yuan Bao in sight.

169
00:10:53,039 --> 00:10:54,482
Qi Yuan Bao always has

170
00:10:54,799 --> 00:10:56,242
a lot of tricks up her sleeve.

171
00:10:56,440 --> 00:10:58,082
If she intends to hide from us,

172
00:10:58,520 --> 00:10:59,802
it'll take us some time.

173
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:03,423
Master instructed us to find her before Qi Lian does.

174
00:11:03,559 --> 00:11:04,922
Understood.

175
00:11:05,359 --> 00:11:06,562
Yun,

176
00:11:06,760 --> 00:11:08,649
why does Father want Qi Yuan Bao specifically?

177
00:11:11,799 --> 00:11:13,242
All right, I shall not pry.

178
00:11:13,520 --> 00:11:15,762
There must be a confidential reason.

179
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:17,202
Shen,

180
00:11:17,400 --> 00:11:18,642
no matter what Master does,

181
00:11:18,840 --> 00:11:20,282
you just need to believe

182
00:11:20,440 --> 00:11:23,396
that he is doing it for our sect.

183
00:11:25,394 --> 00:11:26,394
I see.

184
00:11:26,475 --> 00:11:29,242
The priority now is to find Qi Yuan Bao as soon as possible.

185
00:11:30,359 --> 00:11:32,482
If I find anything, I'll let you know right away.

186
00:11:34,880 --> 00:11:35,903
Shen.

187
00:11:37,760 --> 00:11:38,783
Be careful.

188
00:11:53,359 --> 00:11:55,242
Why are you still following me?

189
00:11:56,598 --> 00:11:58,042
I have to stay by your side.

190
00:11:58,444 --> 00:11:59,595
Why?

191
00:12:04,599 --> 00:12:06,009
Master.

192
00:12:07,078 --> 00:12:09,282
You keep following me.

193
00:12:09,653 --> 00:12:12,602
Do you have an ulterior motive?

194
00:12:13,615 --> 00:12:14,638
Listen.

195
00:12:14,742 --> 00:12:19,202
I am not interested in a boring and dull person like you.

196
00:12:19,532 --> 00:12:22,035
- So you had better not...   - Yuan Bao!

197
00:12:23,840 --> 00:12:25,122
Yuan Bao!

198
00:12:26,533 --> 00:12:28,002
She won't leave me alone.

199
00:12:28,142 --> 00:12:30,002
- Let's go.   - Yuan Bao!

200
00:12:30,877 --> 00:12:31,900
Why are you running?

201
00:12:31,984 --> 00:12:33,065
- Yuan Bao!   - Yuan Bao!

202
00:12:33,146 --> 00:12:34,425
Yuan Bao!

203
00:12:34,559 --> 00:12:35,682
Young Lady!

204
00:12:37,200 --> 00:12:38,146
Qi Lian.

205
00:12:38,471 --> 00:12:40,322
You'll regret this one day.

206
00:12:40,518 --> 00:12:42,806
- Yuan Bao!   - Yuan Bao!

207
00:12:44,086 --> 00:12:46,562
Master, the miasma in this forest is poisonous.

208
00:12:49,440 --> 00:12:51,039
Quick. Lend help.

209
00:12:51,119 --> 00:12:52,682
- Come.   - Evacuate immediately.

210
00:12:52,941 --> 00:12:54,562
- Help them.   - Quick.

211
00:12:56,919 --> 00:12:59,042
Quick. Let's go.

212
00:12:59,200 --> 00:13:00,482
Hurry.

213
00:13:01,039 --> 00:13:02,722
- Is that her?   - Quick.

214
00:13:05,452 --> 00:13:06,682
Qi Yuan Bao!

215
00:13:08,239 --> 00:13:09,262
Wait.

216
00:13:09,991 --> 00:13:11,551
- Wait.   - Why?

217
00:13:11,679 --> 00:13:13,082
- If we wait...   - Yuan Bao.

218
00:13:14,441 --> 00:13:15,788
Why are you running?

219
00:13:15,874 --> 00:13:17,360
I'm a fool if I don't run away when I see

220
00:13:17,502 --> 00:13:18,682
someone charging at me.

221
00:13:18,928 --> 00:13:20,682
You're not wrong.

222
00:13:20,772 --> 00:13:21,772
Where is my father?

223
00:13:21,884 --> 00:13:24,054
They... They are over there.

224
00:13:25,359 --> 00:13:26,515
Good.

225
00:13:29,039 --> 00:13:30,062
You...

226
00:13:30,828 --> 00:13:33,092
- Are you here to signal them?   - Not at all.

227
00:13:33,354 --> 00:13:36,322
I don't agree with your father's decision to keep you locked up either.

228
00:13:36,683 --> 00:13:38,002
Then why did you come along?

229
00:13:38,157 --> 00:13:39,180
I...

230
00:13:47,039 --> 00:13:47,738
Something's wrong.

231
00:13:48,200 --> 00:13:50,522
Something's wrong? What is it?

232
00:13:52,320 --> 00:13:53,882
We're surrounded by miasma.

233
00:14:00,115 --> 00:14:02,155
Mr. Chang Yue, there is miasma.

234
00:14:02,236 --> 00:14:03,445
We should leave now.

235
00:14:04,239 --> 00:14:05,262
Let's go.

236
00:14:09,719 --> 00:14:10,742
Yuan Bao!

237
00:14:11,640 --> 00:14:14,042
Yuan Bao, can you hear me?

238
00:14:15,757 --> 00:14:16,858
Yuan Bao!

239
00:14:19,640 --> 00:14:21,882
- What?   - Where is Shen Shen?

240
00:14:23,990 --> 00:14:26,069
Are you crazy? There is miasma inside.

241
00:14:26,170 --> 00:14:27,267
You will die in there.

242
00:14:27,334 --> 00:14:28,446
Let go! I need to find Shen Shen.

243
00:14:30,760 --> 00:14:33,082
- Shen Shen.   - I won't stop your death wish then.

244
00:14:36,080 --> 00:14:37,118
Shen Shen.

245
00:14:37,559 --> 00:14:38,267
Wait for me.

246
00:15:09,280 --> 00:15:10,303
Yuan Bao!

247
00:15:10,718 --> 00:15:11,741
Shen Shen.

248
00:15:13,612 --> 00:15:15,088
Yuan Bao!

249
00:15:27,679 --> 00:15:28,802
Yuan Bao!

250
00:15:29,052 --> 00:15:30,220
Can you hear me?

251
00:15:30,333 --> 00:15:31,356
Shen Shen.

252
00:15:31,437 --> 00:15:32,460
Shen Shen.

253
00:15:53,054 --> 00:15:54,077
Yuan Bao.

254
00:15:54,681 --> 00:15:55,882
Yuan Bao.

255
00:15:57,321 --> 00:15:58,562
Master.

256
00:15:58,919 --> 00:15:59,920
Get up now.

257
00:16:00,047 --> 00:16:01,070
Are you okay?

258
00:16:08,280 --> 00:16:09,802
Where are we?

259
00:16:12,606 --> 00:16:14,129
This place is so beautiful.

260
00:16:14,895 --> 00:16:17,402
I find it rather strange.

261
00:16:17,910 --> 00:16:19,202
Danger lurks in beauty.

262
00:16:19,549 --> 00:16:21,042
We should be cautious.

263
00:16:44,822 --> 00:16:46,282
- Are you all right?   - I am fine.

264
00:16:46,487 --> 00:16:48,162
What the heck is this?

265
00:16:52,815 --> 00:16:54,042
Yuan Bao!

266
00:16:54,238 --> 00:16:55,522
Shen Shen.

267
00:16:57,059 --> 00:16:58,322
Yuan Bao!

268
00:16:58,406 --> 00:17:00,002
- Shen Shen!   - Yuan Bao!

269
00:17:00,827 --> 00:17:02,036
Yuan Bao!

270
00:17:02,124 --> 00:17:03,920
Shen Shen!

271
00:17:04,078 --> 00:17:05,442
Are you done?

272
00:17:06,492 --> 00:17:07,925
You are so annoying! You keep shouting.

273
00:17:07,950 --> 00:17:08,999
My ears are hurting.

274
00:17:09,157 --> 00:17:10,367
Do you think I like your screaming?

275
00:17:10,564 --> 00:17:12,380
You are too close to me. You are so clingy.

276
00:17:13,054 --> 00:17:14,054
Are you serious right now?

277
00:17:14,135 --> 00:17:15,802
You followed me in here.

278
00:17:16,044 --> 00:17:18,602
What are you? A stalker?

279
00:17:19,321 --> 00:17:20,562
Fine.

280
00:17:20,909 --> 00:17:23,118
Perhaps I'm too kind for my own good.

281
00:17:23,299 --> 00:17:26,660
From now on, we go our own ways.

282
00:17:26,741 --> 00:17:28,362
See you never.

283
00:17:30,126 --> 00:17:32,242
That way, Second Young Lady Su.

284
00:17:32,917 --> 00:17:34,402
I won't see you off.

285
00:18:06,008 --> 00:18:08,562
What is this thing? Why is it only attacking me?

286
00:18:11,109 --> 00:18:12,402
Blood will attract it.

287
00:18:19,640 --> 00:18:21,002
Mr. Chang Yue.

288
00:18:23,405 --> 00:18:24,612
Chang Yue!

289
00:18:35,239 --> 00:18:36,642
- Mr. Chang Yue.   - Master.

290
00:18:38,204 --> 00:18:41,122
It is not safe here. Let's find a safe place to hide.

291
00:18:41,560 --> 00:18:42,583
Let's go.

292
00:18:59,760 --> 00:19:00,405
What are you staring at?

293
00:19:07,011 --> 00:19:08,282
Master,

294
00:19:08,562 --> 00:19:10,651
how is your injury?

295
00:19:12,924 --> 00:19:13,947
I am fine.

296
00:19:16,118 --> 00:19:19,682
I used to think you were cold

297
00:19:19,861 --> 00:19:21,282
and aloof.

298
00:19:21,455 --> 00:19:23,042
It seems like

299
00:19:23,358 --> 00:19:24,882
I was wrong.

300
00:19:29,325 --> 00:19:30,682
Is that a compliment?

301
00:19:30,939 --> 00:19:32,282
I guess so.

302
00:19:32,565 --> 00:19:35,362
I don't hand out compliments easily.

303
00:19:39,222 --> 00:19:40,522
Mr. Chang Yue,

304
00:19:42,164 --> 00:19:43,187
your injury is quite serious.

305
00:19:43,292 --> 00:19:44,315
Take this.

306
00:19:44,520 --> 00:19:46,762
It is the best medicine from my sect.

307
00:19:46,861 --> 00:19:48,682
It will work right after you apply it.

308
00:19:59,538 --> 00:20:00,305
Thank you.

309
00:20:14,116 --> 00:20:15,285
She gave it to you.

310
00:20:15,417 --> 00:20:16,842
Why are you giving it to me?

311
00:20:18,628 --> 00:20:19,582
My injury is not serious.

312
00:20:22,181 --> 00:20:23,417
Mine is not serious either.

313
00:20:23,547 --> 00:20:24,882
You should keep it for yourself.

314
00:20:33,153 --> 00:20:34,092
Young Lady Su...

315
00:20:39,414 --> 00:20:41,175
See? It is all your fault.

316
00:20:41,331 --> 00:20:44,082
Why did you give me the thing she gave you?

317
00:20:44,781 --> 00:20:46,262
She gave it to me. It is mine.

318
00:20:46,381 --> 00:20:47,602
Why can't I give it to you?

319
00:20:48,400 --> 00:20:51,122
Are you truly that dumb or are you pretending to be one?

320
00:20:57,214 --> 00:20:59,753
When a lady gives you something, it has a special meaning.

321
00:20:59,885 --> 00:21:00,908
You can turn her down.

322
00:21:01,048 --> 00:21:02,162
But if you accept it,

323
00:21:02,330 --> 00:21:03,647
you cannot give it to someone else,

324
00:21:03,760 --> 00:21:05,239
let alone another lady.

325
00:21:05,374 --> 00:21:06,397
Understood?

326
00:21:11,479 --> 00:21:12,842
I understand.

327
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:13,698
Do you?

328
00:21:19,160 --> 00:21:20,442
Where are you going?

329
00:21:22,854 --> 00:21:25,143
Finally, he gets it.

330
00:21:26,888 --> 00:21:28,354
Young Lady Su,

331
00:21:30,269 --> 00:21:31,415
please take it back.

332
00:21:32,239 --> 00:21:33,262
Why?

333
00:21:33,460 --> 00:21:34,483
I only accepted it

334
00:21:34,572 --> 00:21:35,733
because I wanted Yuan Bao to have it.

335
00:21:37,556 --> 00:21:39,196
But she said that I shouldn't accept

336
00:21:39,277 --> 00:21:41,602
or give away something a lady gave me easily.

337
00:21:41,727 --> 00:21:42,320
Are you...

338
00:21:42,920 --> 00:21:44,882
Are you mocking me now?

339
00:21:45,420 --> 00:21:47,100
No. Young Lady Su.

340
00:21:47,196 --> 00:21:48,717
No. You're mistaken.

341
00:21:48,907 --> 00:21:50,122
Young Lady Su.

342
00:21:50,389 --> 00:21:52,802
Young Lady Su, it's not what you think it is.

343
00:21:55,942 --> 00:21:58,762
It's your fault. You're going to get me into trouble sooner or later.

344
00:22:03,520 --> 00:22:04,882
You...

345
00:22:05,472 --> 00:22:06,762
Are you okay?

346
00:22:06,905 --> 00:22:08,082
Master?

347
00:22:09,452 --> 00:22:10,452
I am furious.

348
00:22:10,570 --> 00:22:13,522
Qi Yuan Bao is making fun of me.

349
00:22:22,714 --> 00:22:24,002
How strange.

350
00:22:25,640 --> 00:22:27,642
Why can't I use my power here?

351
00:22:30,800 --> 00:22:32,082
Yuan Bao!

352
00:22:32,599 --> 00:22:33,622
Yuan Bao!

353
00:22:35,280 --> 00:22:36,303
Yuan Bao!

354
00:22:38,919 --> 00:22:40,448
Can you walk faster?

355
00:22:40,830 --> 00:22:43,366
Xue Han Yu, don't you find this place creepy?

356
00:22:43,533 --> 00:22:44,251
Not at all.

357
00:22:55,773 --> 00:22:57,789
What now? Did you trip on flat ground?

358
00:22:57,940 --> 00:23:00,042
Why are you so clumsy?

359
00:23:00,607 --> 00:23:02,402
I think I was bitten by a snake.

360
00:23:02,540 --> 00:23:03,842
Where?

361
00:23:05,212 --> 00:23:06,613
Xue Han Yu!

362
00:23:06,701 --> 00:23:08,682
Over there!

363
00:23:21,733 --> 00:23:23,962
This snake is extremely venomous.

364
00:23:25,788 --> 00:23:27,049
What should I do?

365
00:23:27,950 --> 00:23:29,472
I can only check the wound first.

366
00:23:35,079 --> 00:23:37,282
If we don't remove the toxin in time,

367
00:23:38,293 --> 00:23:39,682
you might die.

368
00:23:44,080 --> 00:23:45,442
I can't feel my leg.

369
00:23:45,828 --> 00:23:47,242
I am dizzy

370
00:23:48,862 --> 00:23:49,885
Are you okay?

371
00:23:50,181 --> 00:23:51,402
Wake up!

372
00:23:51,518 --> 00:23:52,541
Careful.

373
00:23:56,962 --> 00:23:58,642
You must have been poisoned by the flower.

374
00:23:58,723 --> 00:23:59,882
Let me take a look.

375
00:24:09,645 --> 00:24:11,345
What is that? It is so pretty.

376
00:24:11,700 --> 00:24:12,922
Let me see.

377
00:24:15,517 --> 00:24:16,150
Never mind.

378
00:24:17,317 --> 00:24:18,310
So stingy.

379
00:24:18,862 --> 00:24:21,298
I think it's pretty and want to admire it for a while.

380
00:24:21,982 --> 00:24:23,602
Let me check on your wound first.

381
00:24:26,809 --> 00:24:28,626
You're a man. Why are you so shy?

382
00:24:28,651 --> 00:24:29,842
I didn't even complain.

383
00:24:29,966 --> 00:24:31,461
Also, do not get me wrong.

384
00:24:32,102 --> 00:24:35,165
I just want to suck the venom out.

385
00:24:35,301 --> 00:24:36,682
That's all.

386
00:24:39,134 --> 00:24:40,157
What?

387
00:24:40,808 --> 00:24:42,522
Suck it out for you?

388
00:24:43,220 --> 00:24:44,682
With what?

389
00:24:51,725 --> 00:24:52,962
Look how cute I am.

390
00:24:53,120 --> 00:24:55,886
You won't let me die young, will you?

391
00:24:56,582 --> 00:24:58,871
You have read too many romance novels.

392
00:24:59,108 --> 00:25:01,589
Who in the world would suck venom out for someone with their mouth?

393
00:25:01,741 --> 00:25:03,122
Unless they are an idiot.

394
00:25:22,719 --> 00:25:23,720
(If one day,)

395
00:25:23,830 --> 00:25:25,439
(her heart skips a beat when she sees you,)

396
00:25:25,574 --> 00:25:27,122
(she can't help but get close to you,)

397
00:25:27,207 --> 00:25:29,202
(touch you, and kiss you,)

398
00:25:29,479 --> 00:25:31,882
(or when she sees you as the only one,)

399
00:25:32,119 --> 00:25:34,642
(that's when you know she has truly fallen in love with you.)

400
00:25:34,784 --> 00:25:37,362
(When that happens, the in-tandem cultivation is successful!)

401
00:26:27,789 --> 00:26:28,908
Then what should I do?

402
00:26:28,989 --> 00:26:30,358
You won't help me.

403
00:26:31,319 --> 00:26:33,728
You cannot just let me die here, can you?

404
00:26:33,943 --> 00:26:35,522
Xue Han Yu.

405
00:26:43,520 --> 00:26:46,574
You cannot just let me die here, can you?

406
00:26:46,599 --> 00:26:48,562
Xue Han Yu.

407
00:27:03,560 --> 00:27:05,162
Xue Han Yu, what are you doing?

408
00:27:06,800 --> 00:27:08,042
Xue Han Yu!

409
00:27:08,680 --> 00:27:10,440
I haven't let the blood out yet. It'll hurt more.

410
00:27:10,535 --> 00:27:12,362
- Let what out?   - Blood.

411
00:27:12,880 --> 00:27:14,320
Ouch! Xue Han Yu!

412
00:27:14,416 --> 00:27:15,602
What are you doing?

413
00:27:15,719 --> 00:27:18,002
She's biting me.

414
00:27:18,119 --> 00:27:21,042
She's eating me!
