1
00:01:48,962 --> 00:01:54,025
(Dear Mr. Heavenly Fox)

2
00:01:54,106 --> 00:01:57,039
(Episode 8)

3
00:02:07,280 --> 00:02:08,953
You two go ahead first.

4
00:02:09,199 --> 00:02:10,522
I'll be right back.

5
00:02:10,800 --> 00:02:12,162
Are you going to the restroom?

6
00:02:12,595 --> 00:02:13,343
Yes.

7
00:02:13,737 --> 00:02:14,737
Let me go with you.

8
00:02:14,833 --> 00:02:17,473
- No need. I...   - Let me come with you. Let's go.

9
00:02:17,584 --> 00:02:19,482
Master, wait here for us.

10
00:02:19,800 --> 00:02:21,802
(Yuan Bao is wary of me.)

11
00:02:22,358 --> 00:02:23,801
(If she keeps following me,)

12
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:25,437
(I won't be able to make a move.)

13
00:02:25,520 --> 00:02:26,520
Let's go!

14
00:02:27,080 --> 00:02:28,080
Okay.

15
00:02:33,319 --> 00:02:34,917
Come take a look!

16
00:02:35,052 --> 00:02:36,592
Fun little gadgets!

17
00:02:38,439 --> 00:02:39,993
Come take a look!

18
00:02:41,199 --> 00:02:43,032
Mister, feel free to take a look.

19
00:02:46,319 --> 00:02:47,472
Sir, you have a good eye!

20
00:02:47,684 --> 00:02:49,038
This thing is called a kaleidoscope.

21
00:02:49,190 --> 00:02:50,322
Through this small hole,

22
00:02:50,477 --> 00:02:52,162
you can see ever-changing patterns.

23
00:02:52,400 --> 00:02:54,239
It's very novel. Sir, buy one.

24
00:02:54,373 --> 00:02:55,842
(Yuan Bao will definitely like this.)

25
00:03:11,680 --> 00:03:13,082
Why are you so heavy?

26
00:03:13,639 --> 00:03:15,442
We finally found a place to stay.

27
00:03:15,734 --> 00:03:18,842
Why must we settle down in such a dilapidated place?

28
00:03:19,646 --> 00:03:20,802
Second Young Lady Su,

29
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:24,762
we're lucky to find an accommodation in this wilderness.

30
00:03:24,919 --> 00:03:26,162
Don't be picky.

31
00:03:28,280 --> 00:03:29,482
Let me check on your foot.

32
00:03:39,319 --> 00:03:40,319
I'll change the dressing.

33
00:03:49,159 --> 00:03:50,322
It hurts!

34
00:03:50,560 --> 00:03:51,953
Just endure it.

35
00:03:52,118 --> 00:03:53,402
How painful can it be?

36
00:03:56,360 --> 00:03:57,682
Xue Han Yu.

37
00:03:58,000 --> 00:03:59,562
Can't you be a little gentler with me?

38
00:03:59,759 --> 00:04:01,073
Why should I be gentle with you?

39
00:04:01,206 --> 00:04:02,602
You're not Yuan Bao.

40
00:04:02,879 --> 00:04:04,322
Yuan Bao this, Yuan Bao that.

41
00:04:04,520 --> 00:04:06,632
If we remove that word from your brain,

42
00:04:06,840 --> 00:04:08,322
you'd have no brain at all.

43
00:04:09,280 --> 00:04:11,362
Yuan Bao and I grew up together.

44
00:04:11,950 --> 00:04:12,950
The bond between her and me

45
00:04:13,031 --> 00:04:14,642
will never be understood by you.

46
00:04:16,240 --> 00:04:17,352
Who cares?

47
00:04:18,480 --> 00:04:19,118
Fine.

48
00:04:20,120 --> 00:04:20,797
Stay here.

49
00:04:21,240 --> 00:04:22,482
I'll go find some food.

50
00:04:23,959 --> 00:04:24,749
No.

51
00:04:25,392 --> 00:04:25,983
Uhm...

52
00:04:27,106 --> 00:04:28,348
Come back quickly.

53
00:04:28,687 --> 00:04:29,799
All right.

54
00:04:45,102 --> 00:04:46,842
This room is nice.

55
00:04:49,422 --> 00:04:51,162
The bed is comfortable too.

56
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:53,842
Miss, test the water temperature.

57
00:04:54,240 --> 00:04:55,240
Okay.

58
00:04:56,439 --> 00:04:59,402
Can this perfume pouch truly make Chang Yue fall in love with me?

59
00:05:00,079 --> 00:05:01,079
If so,

60
00:05:02,480 --> 00:05:04,993
Yuan Bao and he will definitely part ways.

61
00:05:06,151 --> 00:05:07,552
Enjoy the bath. I'll be on my way.

62
00:05:07,633 --> 00:05:08,802
Go ahead.

63
00:05:11,160 --> 00:05:12,160
Mister.

64
00:05:13,040 --> 00:05:14,233
How can I help, miss?

65
00:05:18,480 --> 00:05:19,722
Mister.

66
00:05:20,040 --> 00:05:22,040
Get me some good liquor.

67
00:05:23,639 --> 00:05:25,922
Got it! Please wait for a moment, miss.

68
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:43,362
Put it below the pillow in Tian Room 1.

69
00:05:44,740 --> 00:05:47,700
Ladies nowadays send gifts in such roundabout ways.

70
00:05:48,360 --> 00:05:50,632
They're becoming so shy.

71
00:05:56,054 --> 00:05:57,442
Young Lady Su.

72
00:05:57,839 --> 00:05:59,762
Why are you drinking

73
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:01,522
in broad daylight?

74
00:06:01,800 --> 00:06:03,082
Who says

75
00:06:03,319 --> 00:06:04,802
one can only drink at night?

76
00:06:13,002 --> 00:06:16,682
(Youyi Inn)

77
00:06:27,160 --> 00:06:28,160
Master.

78
00:06:29,120 --> 00:06:30,120
Master.

79
00:06:43,701 --> 00:06:44,944
Master.

80
00:06:57,720 --> 00:06:58,720
Master.

81
00:07:00,560 --> 00:07:01,882
Mr. Immortal.

82
00:07:20,727 --> 00:07:21,889
Master.

83
00:07:57,685 --> 00:07:58,998
If you like him,

84
00:07:59,120 --> 00:08:00,922
don't wallow in self-pity.

85
00:08:01,318 --> 00:08:03,122
Fight others for him.

86
00:08:03,350 --> 00:08:04,898
Snatch him away by any means necessary.

87
00:08:05,800 --> 00:08:08,002
Give this thing to Chang Yue.

88
00:08:08,240 --> 00:08:09,682
After four hours,

89
00:08:09,862 --> 00:08:11,736
he will be so fond of you

90
00:08:11,954 --> 00:08:13,562
that he cannot control himself.

91
00:08:13,759 --> 00:08:15,802
(Who exactly gave me the perfume pouch?)

92
00:08:17,120 --> 00:08:19,122
(And what is inside that perfume pouch?)

93
00:08:20,030 --> 00:08:21,602
(If she is telling the truth,)

94
00:08:21,875 --> 00:08:23,762
(the perfume pouch should)

95
00:08:24,040 --> 00:08:26,122
(be taking effect by now.)

96
00:08:26,360 --> 00:08:27,962
(According to what she said,)

97
00:08:28,199 --> 00:08:30,122
(I have to go to Chang Yue now.)

98
00:08:34,960 --> 00:08:36,122
Qi Yuan Bao.

99
00:08:38,679 --> 00:08:40,552
Qi Yuan Bao.

100
00:09:03,855 --> 00:09:05,242
Mr. Chang Yue.

101
00:09:12,159 --> 00:09:13,272
Mr. Chang Yue.

102
00:09:20,600 --> 00:09:22,442
Mr. Chang Yue, you...

103
00:09:23,278 --> 00:09:24,520
What's wrong?

104
00:09:30,159 --> 00:09:31,442
Is something the matter?

105
00:09:33,159 --> 00:09:34,282
Nothing.

106
00:09:34,422 --> 00:09:36,094
I couldn't sleep

107
00:09:36,399 --> 00:09:38,042
and want to see you.

108
00:09:38,399 --> 00:09:41,552
But you look sick.

109
00:09:42,879 --> 00:09:43,879
I...

110
00:09:44,519 --> 00:09:46,552
- I...   - Mr. Chang Yue.

111
00:09:47,320 --> 00:09:49,353
It looks like you have a fever.

112
00:09:49,480 --> 00:09:50,912
Should I get you a cup of water?

113
00:09:52,519 --> 00:09:53,519
No need.

114
00:09:54,279 --> 00:09:55,473
Mr. Chang Yue.

115
00:09:55,582 --> 00:09:57,442
- Mr. Chang Yue.   - No need.

116
00:09:58,120 --> 00:09:59,802
I... I'm sleepwalking.

117
00:10:00,320 --> 00:10:01,522
Sleepwalking.

118
00:10:19,662 --> 00:10:20,856
Mr. Chang Yue.

119
00:10:21,080 --> 00:10:22,242
Mr. Chang Yue.

120
00:10:33,159 --> 00:10:35,872
Master, what's wrong with you?

121
00:10:36,039 --> 00:10:37,802
Why are you sweating so much?

122
00:10:37,937 --> 00:10:40,042
It's so warm.

123
00:10:40,879 --> 00:10:43,122
It's so warm.

124
00:10:43,360 --> 00:10:45,122
Warm? Then...

125
00:10:46,886 --> 00:10:48,922
What about this? Is this better?

126
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:51,402
Is this better now?

127
00:10:52,919 --> 00:10:55,319
Maybe you're just too tired from traveling

128
00:10:55,406 --> 00:10:56,482
and fell sick.

129
00:10:56,638 --> 00:10:58,239
Master, wait here.

130
00:10:58,351 --> 00:10:59,722
I'll find a physician for you.

131
00:11:04,919 --> 00:11:06,282
I am indeed sick.

132
00:11:07,759 --> 00:11:09,122
I'm so sick that...

133
00:11:11,879 --> 00:11:13,082
I'm so sick that...

134
00:11:14,279 --> 00:11:15,642
I'm so sick that

135
00:11:15,879 --> 00:11:17,202
I can't stop thinking about you.

136
00:11:17,367 --> 00:11:21,281
You can't stop thinking about me?

137
00:11:25,440 --> 00:11:26,007
Like...

138
00:11:26,380 --> 00:11:28,182
Like what?

139
00:11:32,519 --> 00:11:35,113
Like...

140
00:11:38,559 --> 00:11:39,962
Like bathing with you.

141
00:11:41,159 --> 00:11:42,159
I...

142
00:11:42,679 --> 00:11:43,679
I...

143
00:11:44,519 --> 00:11:46,752
When did I ever have a bath with you?

144
00:11:48,360 --> 00:11:49,402
Oh, Chang Yue.

145
00:11:49,559 --> 00:11:51,313
I thought you were a gentleman.

146
00:11:51,463 --> 00:11:52,695
But you're in fact a pervert.

147
00:11:52,879 --> 00:11:53,879
Go away!

148
00:12:01,320 --> 00:12:03,193
Master...

149
00:12:04,279 --> 00:12:07,953
Are you delirious from the fever?

150
00:12:09,399 --> 00:12:10,399
Yes.

151
00:12:29,120 --> 00:12:31,762
Chang Yue,

152
00:12:31,919 --> 00:12:33,522
do you know

153
00:12:33,654 --> 00:12:36,202
that you're being inappropriate right now?

154
00:12:53,352 --> 00:12:54,308
Go away!

155
00:13:13,480 --> 00:13:15,556
What's happening? Isn't Chang Yue the one who's feeling warm?

156
00:13:15,685 --> 00:13:17,162
Why do I feel warm too?

157
00:13:21,080 --> 00:13:23,082
But come to think of it,

158
00:13:23,247 --> 00:13:25,242
could Chang Yue be possessed?

159
00:13:27,639 --> 00:13:28,639
Forget it. Never mind.

160
00:13:28,759 --> 00:13:29,759
Sleep.

161
00:13:33,487 --> 00:13:36,039
But he looks so unwell.

162
00:13:36,639 --> 00:13:38,202
Maybe I should check on him,

163
00:13:38,351 --> 00:13:40,162
lest people say I'm heartless.

164
00:14:01,879 --> 00:14:04,953
Master, are you feeling better?

165
00:14:08,240 --> 00:14:09,308
Why are you here again?

166
00:14:09,840 --> 00:14:12,479
This is Qishan Sect's fever medicine. It's very effective.

167
00:14:12,559 --> 00:14:14,362
I specifically brought it for you.

168
00:14:16,440 --> 00:14:17,440
Get out!

169
00:14:18,919 --> 00:14:19,919
Get out!

170
00:14:21,660 --> 00:14:23,540
Okay. Then...

171
00:14:23,639 --> 00:14:24,676
I'll leave it here.

172
00:14:24,775 --> 00:14:25,808
Try it later, okay?

173
00:15:24,111 --> 00:15:25,303
Qi Yuan Bao?

174
00:15:26,480 --> 00:15:27,882
What are you doing here?

175
00:15:28,039 --> 00:15:30,162
- What's going on?   - I...

176
00:15:30,383 --> 00:15:32,122
Why is your face so red?

177
00:15:32,720 --> 00:15:33,836
My face is not red.

178
00:15:33,918 --> 00:15:35,438
You should be sleeping at this hour.

179
00:15:35,542 --> 00:15:37,842
Instead, you stand outside my master's room for what?

180
00:15:38,120 --> 00:15:39,402
I...

181
00:15:39,559 --> 00:15:41,362
Stop stuttering. Go to bed.

182
00:15:42,159 --> 00:15:43,562
Why am I here?

183
00:15:50,200 --> 00:15:51,682
My mind is in chaos.

184
00:15:52,320 --> 00:15:54,242
Even the Mind-cleansing Sutra isn't working.

185
00:16:17,440 --> 00:16:19,593
Your Highness, you finally answered my call.

186
00:16:19,751 --> 00:16:21,264
I've been looking for you.

187
00:16:21,480 --> 00:16:24,002
I thought you'd been kidnapped by Yuan Bao.

188
00:16:24,480 --> 00:16:26,713
Oh, Your Highness, why are you still awake this late?

189
00:16:27,879 --> 00:16:29,362
I want to ask you something.

190
00:16:29,840 --> 00:16:30,840
Ask away.

191
00:16:32,039 --> 00:16:33,602
You once told me

192
00:16:34,240 --> 00:16:35,762
that if one day,

193
00:16:36,279 --> 00:16:38,362
one's heart skips a beat when she sees me,

194
00:16:38,879 --> 00:16:40,762
she can't help but get close to me,

195
00:16:41,240 --> 00:16:42,642
touch me,

196
00:16:42,960 --> 00:16:44,482
kiss me,

197
00:16:44,919 --> 00:16:46,682
it means she's in love with me.

198
00:16:47,600 --> 00:16:49,162
What if it's the opposite?

199
00:16:49,600 --> 00:16:51,482
What do you mean? I don't understand.

200
00:16:51,538 --> 00:16:53,461
Your Highness, please elaborate.

201
00:16:57,165 --> 00:16:58,342
If it's the other way around,

202
00:16:59,919 --> 00:17:01,842
my heart skips a beat when I see her,

203
00:17:02,879 --> 00:17:04,460
I can't help but get close to her,

204
00:17:05,519 --> 00:17:06,519
kiss her,

205
00:17:07,640 --> 00:17:09,522
- and touch her?   - What?

206
00:17:09,759 --> 00:17:10,888
Your Highness, are you...

207
00:17:12,200 --> 00:17:13,272
Oh, no.

208
00:17:13,382 --> 00:17:15,202
Your Highness, you're done for this time.

209
00:17:15,359 --> 00:17:16,913
If you're having those kinds of reactions,

210
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:18,357
then you've already been completely

211
00:17:18,440 --> 00:17:19,922
bewitched by Yuan Bao.

212
00:17:20,160 --> 00:17:21,317
This is just the beginning.

213
00:17:21,400 --> 00:17:23,040
Soon, you'll ache for her, pine for her,

214
00:17:23,120 --> 00:17:24,516
and yearn for her.

215
00:17:24,599 --> 00:17:26,042
She'll control you.

216
00:17:26,400 --> 00:17:27,400
Why is this happening?

217
00:17:27,480 --> 00:17:28,480
Why?

218
00:17:28,599 --> 00:17:30,552
Because you've fallen in love.

219
00:17:32,154 --> 00:17:33,482
Your Highness,

220
00:17:33,720 --> 00:17:36,122
whoever falls in love first loses.

221
00:17:36,319 --> 00:17:37,716
You're as innocent as it comes.

222
00:17:37,798 --> 00:17:40,639
While Yuan Bao is a carefree soul who treats everything as a game.

223
00:17:40,735 --> 00:17:42,562
You are no match for her.

224
00:17:42,960 --> 00:17:43,993
To avoid further damage,

225
00:17:44,079 --> 00:17:46,002
you should quit now.

226
00:17:47,160 --> 00:17:48,602
But you said

227
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:50,762
it would be a wonderful feeling.

228
00:17:51,759 --> 00:17:53,122
Did I say that?

229
00:17:53,310 --> 00:17:54,310
You also said

230
00:17:55,039 --> 00:17:56,442
that I would enjoy it.

231
00:17:56,839 --> 00:17:58,522
I made them all up.

232
00:18:03,279 --> 00:18:04,713
Well, not all.

233
00:18:43,854 --> 00:18:45,607
Stop following me.

234
00:18:46,119 --> 00:18:47,476
We're not going the same way.

235
00:18:47,599 --> 00:18:48,752
Go back to your Suyun City.

236
00:18:48,847 --> 00:18:50,282
I'll go find Yuan Bao.

237
00:18:50,958 --> 00:18:52,882
Let me be.

238
00:18:53,599 --> 00:18:55,952
This way leads to Suyun City.

239
00:18:56,039 --> 00:18:57,642
Do you think I'm stupid?

240
00:18:57,799 --> 00:18:59,153
Suyun City is that way.

241
00:18:59,279 --> 00:19:00,515
I'm going this way.

242
00:19:00,620 --> 00:19:02,014
Let's part ways here.

243
00:19:02,119 --> 00:19:04,312
You keep saying you're going to find Yuan Bao.

244
00:19:05,160 --> 00:19:06,759
But you don't even know where she is.

245
00:19:07,240 --> 00:19:08,713
I have my own way of finding her.

246
00:19:08,880 --> 00:19:10,202
It's none of your business.

247
00:19:29,960 --> 00:19:31,242
Shen Shen is there.

248
00:19:49,279 --> 00:19:50,522
What now...

249
00:19:52,880 --> 00:19:54,282
You help me. I'll help you.

250
00:19:54,799 --> 00:19:55,799
Where is it?

251
00:19:55,910 --> 00:19:57,762
Do you know how to undo this?

252
00:19:58,440 --> 00:19:59,602
Move.

253
00:19:59,680 --> 00:20:01,913
Su Qian Qian, did you cross someone again?

254
00:20:02,680 --> 00:20:03,962
Of course, no.

255
00:20:04,440 --> 00:20:06,802
With your temper, it's no surprise you crossed many people.

256
00:20:08,473 --> 00:20:09,273
Sir,

257
00:20:10,680 --> 00:20:11,913
every grudge has its own maker.

258
00:20:12,039 --> 00:20:13,362
If she's the one who crossed you,

259
00:20:13,480 --> 00:20:14,552
just go for her.

260
00:20:14,720 --> 00:20:16,400
I'm not close to her. I'm serious.

261
00:20:16,468 --> 00:20:17,710
I... Xue Han Yu,

262
00:20:17,735 --> 00:20:19,602
where's your cavalry? Are you even a man?

263
00:20:20,160 --> 00:20:22,042
What cavalry is there in this moment?

264
00:20:22,440 --> 00:20:23,842
You... I...

265
00:20:29,791 --> 00:20:31,074
What's with all the noises?

266
00:20:34,160 --> 00:20:34,799
Sir.

267
00:20:36,079 --> 00:20:38,202
Sir, do you want money or beauty?

268
00:20:39,200 --> 00:20:41,562
This is Second Young Lady Su of the Su family.

269
00:20:42,599 --> 00:20:44,482
What do you want from us?

270
00:20:45,079 --> 00:20:47,962
I have money. For a fun time, pick him.

271
00:20:55,759 --> 00:20:56,759
Tell me.

272
00:20:56,960 --> 00:20:58,153
Where is Qi Yuan Bao right now?

273
00:20:59,599 --> 00:21:01,393
You're after Yuan Bao?

274
00:21:01,680 --> 00:21:03,442
What lousy taste is that?

275
00:21:03,599 --> 00:21:05,233
Do you know how to contact her?

276
00:21:06,200 --> 00:21:07,882
Either you take me to her

277
00:21:08,200 --> 00:21:09,993
or you bring her here.

278
00:21:10,240 --> 00:21:11,522
Ptooey!

279
00:21:12,920 --> 00:21:13,920
Xue Han Yu!

280
00:21:17,913 --> 00:21:19,298
It's Chang Yue's fault.

281
00:21:20,240 --> 00:21:21,792
I didn't sleep well last night.

282
00:21:21,902 --> 00:21:23,334
How am I supposed to travel like this?

283
00:21:26,960 --> 00:21:29,032
You deserve it.

284
00:21:29,559 --> 00:21:32,393
You walked around instead of sleeping last night.

285
00:21:32,720 --> 00:21:33,720
I...

286
00:22:01,480 --> 00:22:03,233
An aphrodisiac designed against the fox clan.

287
00:22:05,920 --> 00:22:06,920
Why would it be here?

288
00:22:08,771 --> 00:22:10,282
- Thank you.   - Thanks, sir.

289
00:22:11,230 --> 00:22:12,642
After you.

290
00:22:14,680 --> 00:22:15,882
Master.

291
00:22:16,200 --> 00:22:17,522
Mr. Chang Yue.

292
00:22:50,960 --> 00:22:52,322
Please enjoy your meal.

293
00:22:55,960 --> 00:22:57,322
Did you sleep well last night?

294
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:09,642
I slept very well last night.

295
00:23:25,359 --> 00:23:26,602
You first.

296
00:23:30,200 --> 00:23:31,442
Me first.

297
00:23:58,839 --> 00:23:59,839
Miss Su,

298
00:24:00,599 --> 00:24:02,042
may I have a word with you?

299
00:24:04,359 --> 00:24:05,359
Sure.

300
00:24:10,480 --> 00:24:11,722
Xue Han Yu!

301
00:24:13,400 --> 00:24:14,562
I'll ask you one more time.

302
00:24:14,720 --> 00:24:15,882
Where is Qi Yuan Bao?

303
00:24:16,119 --> 00:24:17,352
I'll tell you one more time.

304
00:24:17,519 --> 00:24:19,602
I don't know where she is.

305
00:24:19,851 --> 00:24:21,254
You're quite stubborn.

306
00:24:21,279 --> 00:24:22,393
No!

307
00:24:23,640 --> 00:24:25,400
Stop being stubborn. Just tell him!

308
00:24:25,495 --> 00:24:27,082
Move. Let him hit me.

309
00:24:27,200 --> 00:24:28,920
Send a signal to Yuan Bao now.

310
00:24:30,240 --> 00:24:31,512
I'll say it again.

311
00:24:31,680 --> 00:24:33,922
I don't have a way to contact Yuan Bao.

312
00:24:34,279 --> 00:24:36,153
He does. There's a flute in his pocket.

313
00:24:36,359 --> 00:24:37,359
What are you talking about?

314
00:24:37,519 --> 00:24:38,519
You...

315
00:24:39,920 --> 00:24:40,659
Traitor!

316
00:24:41,200 --> 00:24:42,200
You...

317
00:24:48,559 --> 00:24:50,400
Did you ask someone to put it in my room?

318
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:53,000
Yes.

319
00:24:55,400 --> 00:24:56,873
Where did this perfume pouch come from?

320
00:24:58,359 --> 00:24:59,359
Tell me the truth.

321
00:25:03,920 --> 00:25:05,792
Well,

322
00:25:06,960 --> 00:25:08,922
in that miasma forest,

323
00:25:09,079 --> 00:25:10,362
I met someone.

324
00:25:10,502 --> 00:25:12,769
She gave me this perfume pouch

325
00:25:13,039 --> 00:25:15,042
and said to give it to you.

326
00:25:15,440 --> 00:25:17,042
She told me to just put it

327
00:25:17,160 --> 00:25:18,752
next to your pillow.

328
00:25:19,200 --> 00:25:20,200
Who is she?

329
00:25:20,799 --> 00:25:22,036
She was wearing a cloak.

330
00:25:22,119 --> 00:25:23,762
I couldn't even see her face clearly.

331
00:25:30,799 --> 00:25:32,042
Speak privately?

332
00:25:32,279 --> 00:25:34,792
What can be so private that I must be excluded?

333
00:25:48,839 --> 00:25:50,042
Xue Han Yu?

334
00:25:50,960 --> 00:25:53,112
Has he found us?

335
00:26:03,640 --> 00:26:04,640
Are you mad?

336
00:26:07,282 --> 00:26:08,922
Don't be mad.

337
00:26:09,079 --> 00:26:11,233
If I hadn't told him about it,

338
00:26:11,408 --> 00:26:12,601
you would have been dead already.

339
00:26:12,720 --> 00:26:14,282
Should I thank you now?

340
00:26:14,839 --> 00:26:16,032
Well, no need for that.

341
00:26:24,279 --> 00:26:25,279
That's not right.

342
00:26:25,440 --> 00:26:27,953
I've been leaving marks for Xue Han Yu.

343
00:26:29,119 --> 00:26:30,713
If he wants to find me,

344
00:26:31,200 --> 00:26:33,193
he only needs to follow these marks.

345
00:26:33,559 --> 00:26:36,233
But this place is away from my marks.

346
00:26:36,640 --> 00:26:38,454
Did something happen to him?

347
00:26:39,920 --> 00:26:42,077
Let's see whether Yuan Bao

348
00:26:42,191 --> 00:26:44,682
will walk into this trap for you two.

349
00:26:45,799 --> 00:26:46,418
Listen.

350
00:26:46,960 --> 00:26:47,993
Yuan Bao is very smart.

351
00:26:48,118 --> 00:26:49,442
She will never come.

352
00:26:49,559 --> 00:26:50,559
Just give up.

353
00:26:50,680 --> 00:26:51,584
Xue Han Yu?

354
00:26:55,559 --> 00:26:56,682
Is that so?

355
00:26:56,920 --> 00:26:58,352
Let's see.

356
00:26:59,400 --> 00:27:00,917
Stop provoking him.

357
00:27:01,000 --> 00:27:02,000
Don't touch me.

358
00:27:03,119 --> 00:27:04,482
It's such an obvious trap.

359
00:27:04,869 --> 00:27:06,232
If she comes here,

360
00:27:06,480 --> 00:27:08,792
she's as foolish as you two.

361
00:27:13,000 --> 00:27:14,162
You're the foolish one!

362
00:27:31,000 --> 00:27:32,000
Qi Yuan Bao?

363
00:27:32,240 --> 00:27:33,719
Yuan Bao? Yuan Bao, run!

364
00:27:33,830 --> 00:27:34,904
Don't come. Run!

365
00:27:35,038 --> 00:27:36,038
Yuan Bao!

366
00:27:36,167 --> 00:27:37,244
- Xue Han Yu.   - Yuan Bao!

367
00:27:37,325 --> 00:27:38,645
- Xue Han Yu!   - Go now!

368
00:27:47,279 --> 00:27:49,362
Yuan Bao, run! Don't come.

369
00:27:52,640 --> 00:27:53,640
We meet again.

370
00:27:53,759 --> 00:27:54,882
Qi Yuan Bao.

371
00:27:55,200 --> 00:27:56,745
You finally came. I'm so scared.

372
00:27:59,240 --> 00:28:00,552
Yuan Bao, you knew this was a trap.

373
00:28:00,680 --> 00:28:01,832
Why did you come?

374
00:28:02,359 --> 00:28:04,825
What else can I do? He kidnapped the cousin I care about the most.

375
00:28:07,359 --> 00:28:10,482
Now is not the moment to be sentimental.

376
00:28:10,882 --> 00:28:12,879
Now is not the moment to cry.

377
00:28:12,960 --> 00:28:14,482
Don't embarrass me.

378
00:28:16,759 --> 00:28:18,680
Release Xue Han Yu. The one you want is me.

379
00:28:18,839 --> 00:28:20,759
You're not in a position to negotiate with me.

380
00:28:21,720 --> 00:28:22,331
Is that so?

381
00:28:24,271 --> 00:28:25,658
- Yuan Bao!   - Yuan Bao!

382
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:27,000
What are you doing?

383
00:28:27,086 --> 00:28:28,682
If I'm not wrong,

384
00:28:29,000 --> 00:28:31,913
you want me alive.

385
00:28:34,799 --> 00:28:36,762
If I kill myself,

386
00:28:37,240 --> 00:28:39,362
you won't be able to explain to your superiors.

387
00:28:39,880 --> 00:28:41,282
Don't be rash.

388
00:28:42,240 --> 00:28:43,240
Release him.

389
00:28:48,440 --> 00:28:49,882
I can release him.

390
00:28:50,039 --> 00:28:51,039
But you'll stay.

391
00:28:51,240 --> 00:28:52,592
No! Don't listen to him.

392
00:28:52,759 --> 00:28:53,759
Go!

393
00:28:53,919 --> 00:28:55,791
- Okay.   - What are you doing?

394
00:28:55,920 --> 00:28:56,920
Yuan Bao.

395
00:28:57,673 --> 00:28:59,082
Flee with Xue Han Yu later.

396
00:28:59,400 --> 00:29:00,433
Yuan Bao, are you crazy?

397
00:29:00,614 --> 00:29:02,802
Run! I don't need you to save me!

398
00:29:03,680 --> 00:29:05,602
Don't come closer. Run!

399
00:29:05,920 --> 00:29:07,442
Run! I don't need you to save me!

400
00:29:07,599 --> 00:29:09,153
Run! I can handle him alone.

401
00:29:09,279 --> 00:29:10,279
Run.

402
00:29:12,079 --> 00:29:13,272
Yuan Bao.

403
00:29:13,640 --> 00:29:15,279
Run. You...

404
00:29:15,359 --> 00:29:16,802
Don't go, Yuan Bao.

405
00:29:17,000 --> 00:29:18,400
Stop dawdling

406
00:29:18,480 --> 00:29:19,880
- and run!   - Yuan Bao!

407
00:29:19,960 --> 00:29:21,042
- Xue Han Yu.   - Yuan Bao!

408
00:29:21,160 --> 00:29:22,160
Go!

409
00:29:22,319 --> 00:29:24,442
- Yuan Bao!   - Your current spiritual power

410
00:29:24,599 --> 00:29:26,242
is no match for me.

411
00:29:26,680 --> 00:29:29,002
Come with me obediently.

412
00:29:29,279 --> 00:29:29,832
Is that so?

413
00:29:30,880 --> 00:29:32,602
Then you don't know me at all.

414
00:29:32,839 --> 00:29:35,112
Su Qian Qian, what are you doing? Are you insane?

415
00:29:35,240 --> 00:29:36,059
Come here.

416
00:29:37,119 --> 00:29:39,042
- Hurry up.   - You're forcing my hands.

417
00:29:39,200 --> 00:29:40,402
If you go back now,

418
00:29:40,510 --> 00:29:42,042
what can you do for her?

419
00:29:42,440 --> 00:29:43,682
Even if I can't be useful,

420
00:29:43,839 --> 00:29:45,559
at least she'll have company in the afterlife!

421
00:29:56,830 --> 00:29:59,322
I can't kill you, but I can break your arm to make you behave.

422
00:30:07,759 --> 00:30:08,305
Watch out.

423
00:30:11,561 --> 00:30:13,317
What do you think? Did I arrive in time?

424
00:30:13,342 --> 00:30:14,212
You're welcome.

425
00:30:14,559 --> 00:30:16,392
You guys left. Why did you come back?

426
00:30:16,839 --> 00:30:18,512
What? Only you can play the hero?

427
00:30:18,640 --> 00:30:20,552
I'm not weak either.

428
00:30:21,232 --> 00:30:21,849
Exactly!

429
00:30:22,720 --> 00:30:23,752
You idiots.

430
00:30:23,839 --> 00:30:25,682
I wanted you to get reinforcements!

431
00:30:35,693 --> 00:30:36,475
Yuan Bao.

432
00:30:39,720 --> 00:30:40,249
Yuan Bao.

433
00:30:43,998 --> 00:30:44,617
Sir.

434
00:30:45,079 --> 00:30:47,002
She left in a hurry just now.

435
00:30:47,682 --> 00:30:48,682
(Tian Room 5)

436
00:30:50,209 --> 00:30:52,676
(Tian Room 5)

437
00:30:55,240 --> 00:30:56,602
Mr. Chang Yue!

438
00:31:08,200 --> 00:31:10,322
- Xue Han Yu!   - Let him go!

439
00:31:10,513 --> 00:31:12,922
Yuan Bao, surrender now.

440
00:31:13,079 --> 00:31:14,962
Otherwise, I'll snap his neck!

441
00:31:15,805 --> 00:31:18,078
- No!   - Yuan Bao, don't worry about me.

442
00:31:18,159 --> 00:31:19,362
Just run.

443
00:31:21,144 --> 00:31:23,262
- You...   - Just run.

444
00:31:31,248 --> 00:31:33,122
- Xue Han Yu!   - No!

445
00:31:47,896 --> 00:31:49,802
Since you're so eager to die,

446
00:31:50,160 --> 00:31:51,682
I'll grant your wish.

447
00:32:13,000 --> 00:32:14,060
No!

448
00:32:25,518 --> 00:32:26,147
Oh, no.

449
00:32:33,759 --> 00:32:34,758
Yuan Bao.

450
00:32:35,480 --> 00:32:36,962
- Qian Qian!   - Yuan Bao!

451
00:32:37,599 --> 00:32:39,320
- Are you all right?   - I'm okay.

452
00:32:39,446 --> 00:32:39,866
He...

453
00:32:40,599 --> 00:32:41,286
Yuan Bao.

454
00:32:43,400 --> 00:32:44,271
- Yuan Bao.   - Xue Han Yu.

455
00:32:50,240 --> 00:32:51,482
Chang Yue.

456
00:32:53,121 --> 00:32:54,690
Chang Yue.

457
00:33:12,839 --> 00:33:14,402
(Her vessels are all ruptured.)
