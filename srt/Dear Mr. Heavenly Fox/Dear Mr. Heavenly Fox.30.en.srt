1
00:01:48,759 --> 00:01:54,019
(Dear Mr. Heavenly Fox)

2
00:01:54,100 --> 00:01:57,067
(Episode 30)

3
00:02:08,362 --> 00:02:11,892
(In Loving Memory of Xue Han Yu, In Loving Memory of Qi Lian)

4
00:02:21,290 --> 00:02:22,922
(Xue Han Yu, what are you doing?)

5
00:02:23,105 --> 00:02:24,618
The blood is not out. That'll hurt more.

6
00:02:24,733 --> 00:02:26,438
- Xue Han Yu!   - What are you doing?

7
00:02:26,519 --> 00:02:28,642
She's biting me!

8
00:02:30,399 --> 00:02:31,759
(Su Qian Qian is Su Qian Qian.)

9
00:02:31,862 --> 00:02:33,162
(Her father is her father.)

10
00:02:33,279 --> 00:02:34,882
(I'm warning you for the last time.)

11
00:02:35,080 --> 00:02:37,240
(If I ever see you bully her again,)

12
00:02:37,391 --> 00:02:38,802
(I'll beat you to a pulp.)

13
00:02:49,399 --> 00:02:50,881
(I promise you when the time comes,)

14
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:52,272
(I'll give you an even bigger)

15
00:02:52,375 --> 00:02:53,682
(and better surprise.)

16
00:02:53,839 --> 00:02:55,602
Be there or be square.

17
00:02:59,600 --> 00:03:00,308
Silly girl.

18
00:03:01,320 --> 00:03:02,482
From now on,

19
00:03:03,240 --> 00:03:04,433
I'm your family.

20
00:03:19,512 --> 00:03:22,972
(In Loving Memory of Xue Han Yu, In Loving Memory of Qi Lian)

21
00:03:31,520 --> 00:03:33,082
Today is a joyous day.

22
00:03:34,345 --> 00:03:35,345
I can't cry.

23
00:03:36,839 --> 00:03:38,021
It'll bring bad luck.

24
00:04:08,092 --> 00:04:10,365
(In Loving Memory of Xue Han Yu, In Loving Memory of Qi Lian)

25
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:05,000
Miss Su!

26
00:06:14,600 --> 00:06:15,600
Chang Yue.

27
00:06:17,200 --> 00:06:18,562
It's come to this.

28
00:06:19,480 --> 00:06:20,922
Why are you still here?

29
00:06:23,833 --> 00:06:25,482
I'm paying respects to Father-in-law.

30
00:06:25,900 --> 00:06:27,602
Don't call him that anymore.

31
00:06:31,160 --> 00:06:32,018
I'm here to pay respects to

32
00:06:35,493 --> 00:06:36,499
Sect Leader Qi.

33
00:06:37,559 --> 00:06:39,042
You're not worthy.

34
00:08:59,145 --> 00:09:00,362
Yuan Bao,

35
00:09:01,664 --> 00:09:03,482
do you feel any better now?

36
00:09:36,339 --> 00:09:37,602
Chang Yue.

37
00:09:39,760 --> 00:09:41,882
How did we become like this?

38
00:09:43,119 --> 00:09:45,722
Why did you kill my father and Xue Han Yu?

39
00:09:46,421 --> 00:09:47,602
Didn't you say

40
00:09:47,814 --> 00:09:51,047
you would protect me and love me for all eternity?

41
00:09:52,479 --> 00:09:54,282
Why did it turn out like this?

42
00:09:55,027 --> 00:09:57,282
Why did it have to be you?

43
00:10:03,233 --> 00:10:04,322
Father-in-law!

44
00:10:04,599 --> 00:10:05,599
Chang Yue,

45
00:10:06,481 --> 00:10:08,282
kill me now.

46
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:10,602
Don't tell Yuan Bao

47
00:10:11,719 --> 00:10:13,672
what happened today.

48
00:10:14,520 --> 00:10:17,362
If she knew she had committed such a crime,

49
00:10:18,309 --> 00:10:20,362
she would never be at peace.

50
00:10:32,442 --> 00:10:33,626
I'm sorry.

51
00:10:36,133 --> 00:10:37,562
I broke my promise.

52
00:10:38,799 --> 00:10:40,282
I can't avenge them,

53
00:10:41,919 --> 00:10:43,282
nor can I let you go.

54
00:10:44,616 --> 00:10:46,002
Then I'll let you

55
00:10:47,080 --> 00:10:48,472
end it all.

56
00:11:40,520 --> 00:11:41,351
Chang Yue.

57
00:11:42,840 --> 00:11:43,604
Kill me.

58
00:11:47,479 --> 00:11:48,633
Free me.

59
00:11:50,160 --> 00:11:50,714
Young Lady!

60
00:12:18,760 --> 00:12:19,452
Yuan Bao,

61
00:12:23,559 --> 00:12:25,722
if you could avenge your father with your own hands,

62
00:12:27,400 --> 00:12:29,082
would you feel any better?

63
00:13:15,760 --> 00:13:16,760
Yuan Bao.

64
00:13:19,884 --> 00:13:22,122
I'll teach you a way to get revenge.

65
00:13:48,599 --> 00:13:49,762
Chang Yue,

66
00:13:50,051 --> 00:13:51,522
what are you doing?

67
00:13:55,222 --> 00:13:58,402
Mohun is the lifeblood of the heavenly fox.

68
00:14:01,800 --> 00:14:03,162
If Mohun shatters,

69
00:14:04,507 --> 00:14:06,642
the heavenly fox will also die.

70
00:14:11,570 --> 00:14:12,812
Yuan Bao,

71
00:14:13,999 --> 00:14:15,362
you've avenged him.

72
00:14:15,599 --> 00:14:16,545
No.

73
00:14:16,979 --> 00:14:17,852
Chang Yue,

74
00:14:18,377 --> 00:14:19,601
I didn't want you to die.

75
00:14:20,126 --> 00:14:21,762
I didn't want you to die.

76
00:14:24,492 --> 00:14:25,308
Chang Yue.

77
00:14:26,354 --> 00:14:27,082
Chang Yue.

78
00:14:28,280 --> 00:14:29,280
Chang Yue.

79
00:14:30,599 --> 00:14:31,606
Chang Yue!

80
00:14:32,520 --> 00:14:33,260
Chang Yue!

81
00:14:33,894 --> 00:14:34,760
Chang Yue!

82
00:14:35,201 --> 00:14:36,362
Chang Yue!

83
00:14:36,479 --> 00:14:37,682
Chang Yue!

84
00:14:37,960 --> 00:14:38,578
Chang Yue!

85
00:14:39,056 --> 00:14:40,071
Chang Yue!

86
00:14:41,326 --> 00:14:42,848
Chang Yue!

87
00:14:44,719 --> 00:14:46,282
Chang Yue!

88
00:14:49,288 --> 00:14:50,642
Chang Yue.

89
00:14:54,561 --> 00:14:55,802
Chang Yue.

90
00:16:14,725 --> 00:16:17,618
(Kongtong Cauldron)

91
00:16:25,347 --> 00:16:27,952
(If not used properly, this artifact will backfire on its user.)

92
00:16:30,367 --> 00:16:32,420
(...absorb demonic energy.)

93
00:16:35,359 --> 00:16:37,658
Yuan Bao!

94
00:16:38,152 --> 00:16:38,885
Yuan Bao!

95
00:16:42,132 --> 00:16:43,402
Yuan Bao.

96
00:16:45,159 --> 00:16:45,852
Tian.

97
00:16:49,119 --> 00:16:51,202
- What is it?   - Miss Su is seriously ill.

98
00:16:51,445 --> 00:16:52,758
She hasn't woken up for two days.

99
00:16:52,919 --> 00:16:54,202
The physician just came.

100
00:16:54,799 --> 00:16:55,922
He said

101
00:16:56,440 --> 00:16:58,482
she probably didn't have much time left.

102
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:02,615
I know.

103
00:17:03,359 --> 00:17:04,382
Go back to your work.

104
00:17:06,920 --> 00:17:07,395
Yes.

105
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:28,000
Qian Qian.

106
00:17:29,699 --> 00:17:30,170
Qian Qian.

107
00:17:36,599 --> 00:17:37,177
Qian Qian.

108
00:17:42,560 --> 00:17:43,560
Qian Qian.

109
00:17:50,680 --> 00:17:51,952
Stop sleeping. Come.

110
00:17:52,599 --> 00:17:53,633
Come out and play with me.

111
00:18:21,839 --> 00:18:23,273
Come.

112
00:18:31,800 --> 00:18:34,432
Xue Han Yu.

113
00:18:44,280 --> 00:18:45,832
Why are you standing there like an idiot?

114
00:18:56,280 --> 00:18:57,280
Let's go.

115
00:18:57,839 --> 00:18:58,873
Let's hang out.

116
00:18:59,520 --> 00:19:00,520
Come.

117
00:20:51,599 --> 00:20:54,039
Bury Miss Su next to

118
00:20:54,119 --> 00:20:55,119
Xue Han Yu.

119
00:20:55,839 --> 00:20:56,839
Noted.

120
00:21:29,012 --> 00:21:30,039
Stop right there, Xue Han Yu!

121
00:21:30,119 --> 00:21:31,832
You ugly woman, come chase me!

122
00:21:32,079 --> 00:21:33,079
Who are you calling ugly?

123
00:21:33,640 --> 00:21:34,920
Don't run if you can.

124
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:36,239
- Come over here.   - Come.

125
00:21:36,320 --> 00:21:37,320
- There's a bird!   - You...

126
00:21:38,059 --> 00:21:38,729
Hey!

127
00:21:42,239 --> 00:21:43,239
Stop right there!

128
00:21:44,880 --> 00:21:46,800
- Are you a monkey or something?   - You can't catch me.

129
00:21:47,406 --> 00:21:48,786
Come.

130
00:21:49,839 --> 00:21:51,240
- Uncle Qi.   - Stop if you're a man.

131
00:21:51,320 --> 00:21:52,553
Yu, behave now.

132
00:21:52,760 --> 00:21:54,279
- Uncle Qi.   - You...

133
00:21:54,359 --> 00:21:55,359
Come here!

134
00:21:55,439 --> 00:21:56,439
Father.

135
00:21:58,119 --> 00:21:59,119
Chang Yue.

136
00:22:02,400 --> 00:22:03,400
Chang Yue!

137
00:22:10,280 --> 00:22:11,280
Father!

138
00:23:15,280 --> 00:23:16,280
Chang Yue!

139
00:23:20,839 --> 00:23:21,839
It's you.

140
00:23:22,560 --> 00:23:23,285
Qi Yuan Bao.

141
00:23:24,479 --> 00:23:25,952
You killed His Highness.

142
00:23:29,199 --> 00:23:30,199
Do you even know

143
00:23:31,254 --> 00:23:32,495
what he went through to get

144
00:23:32,520 --> 00:23:33,553
Posuo Leaf for you?

145
00:23:34,199 --> 00:23:35,592
You can't be so naive as to think

146
00:23:36,520 --> 00:23:39,112
that His Highness merely took a Heart-Piercing Arrow.

147
00:23:40,640 --> 00:23:41,655
He went through

148
00:23:42,675 --> 00:23:44,656
fire that burned souls.

149
00:23:45,239 --> 00:23:46,920
He was pecked by the eight-clawed cormorants.

150
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:48,793
He went into the Soul-Burning Pool that drinks blood.

151
00:23:49,079 --> 00:23:50,873
He lost eight lives in there.

152
00:23:52,880 --> 00:23:55,232
His Highness was worried that you would feel guilty,

153
00:23:55,800 --> 00:23:57,192
so he always kept it from you.

154
00:23:58,533 --> 00:23:59,533
But what about you?

155
00:24:00,560 --> 00:24:02,033
How did you repay him?

156
00:24:02,959 --> 00:24:05,832
You said Chang Yue lost

157
00:24:06,618 --> 00:24:07,731
eight lives for me?

158
00:24:08,758 --> 00:24:10,031
I've always wondered

159
00:24:11,079 --> 00:24:13,192
why His Highness suddenly killed Sect Leader Qi.

160
00:24:14,285 --> 00:24:15,518
Don't you find it curious too?

161
00:24:19,332 --> 00:24:20,332
No.

162
00:24:21,640 --> 00:24:22,640
I don't want to know.

163
00:24:23,800 --> 00:24:24,800
I beg you.

164
00:24:25,780 --> 00:24:26,780
Don't tell me.

165
00:24:28,599 --> 00:24:29,952
Don't be so cruel to me.

166
00:24:40,280 --> 00:24:42,592
The last wisp of His Highness's soul remains in here.

167
00:24:44,295 --> 00:24:46,112
It also holds the final truth.

168
00:25:05,760 --> 00:25:06,873
How could this be?

169
00:25:23,280 --> 00:25:24,432
How could this be?

170
00:25:26,040 --> 00:25:27,273
How could this be?

171
00:25:30,319 --> 00:25:32,273
It was I who killed my seniors

172
00:25:33,379 --> 00:25:34,972
and Xue Han Yu.

173
00:25:47,160 --> 00:25:49,913
I have never begged anyone before.

174
00:25:51,337 --> 00:25:54,200
You can't let me become a loathsome monster.

175
00:25:54,280 --> 00:25:56,472
- It was me.   - But this isn't fair to you.

176
00:25:56,920 --> 00:25:58,239
As long as I can protect Yuan Bao

177
00:25:58,319 --> 00:25:59,832
and this world,

178
00:26:01,319 --> 00:26:03,153
my death is worth it.

179
00:26:04,959 --> 00:26:07,352
It was I who killed them.

180
00:26:14,199 --> 00:26:16,393
(Only this simple hairpin)

181
00:26:16,680 --> 00:26:18,153
(is worthy of my daughter.)

182
00:26:28,400 --> 00:26:30,712
(Let's go home now. Uncle Qi will definitely have a way to save you.)

183
00:26:40,359 --> 00:26:41,359
(Yuan Bao,)

184
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:43,913
(I'll teach you a way to get revenge.)

185
00:26:47,079 --> 00:26:49,793
(Mohun is the lifeblood of the heavenly fox.)

186
00:26:51,400 --> 00:26:52,400
If Mohun shatters,

187
00:26:53,199 --> 00:26:55,153
the heavenly fox will also die.

188
00:27:00,959 --> 00:27:03,246
It was I who killed them.

189
00:27:03,326 --> 00:27:04,326
(Yuan Bao,)

190
00:27:05,760 --> 00:27:06,760
(you got your revenge.)

191
00:27:23,986 --> 00:27:24,986
It was me.

192
00:28:53,479 --> 00:28:54,479
Qi Yuan Bao!

193
00:28:54,839 --> 00:28:56,432
Qi Yuan Bao!

194
00:29:12,760 --> 00:29:14,162
(Spirit particle is the Sacred One reincarnate.)

195
00:29:14,243 --> 00:29:16,611
(He practices Wordless Mantra and asceticism.)

196
00:29:16,706 --> 00:29:17,787
(When he turns twenty,)

197
00:29:17,868 --> 00:29:20,002
(he will be sacrificed to the heavens to save the world.)

198
00:29:20,280 --> 00:29:22,680
(Isn't the spirit particle twenty years old this year?)

199
00:29:22,760 --> 00:29:25,072
(Does that mean he'll soon be sacrificed to the heavens?)

200
00:29:33,719 --> 00:29:34,719
(Spirit particle,)

201
00:29:34,959 --> 00:29:36,832
(you eat only vegetables and tofu every day.)

202
00:29:37,040 --> 00:29:38,040
(Don't you get tired of it?)

203
00:29:40,880 --> 00:29:41,880
(Spirit particle,)

204
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:43,432
(why didn't you let me in when you were)

205
00:29:43,640 --> 00:29:44,753
(taking a bath just now?)

206
00:29:45,599 --> 00:29:46,599
Impertinent beast.

207
00:29:47,000 --> 00:29:48,000
(Silence.)

208
00:29:57,719 --> 00:29:59,072
(We can't go back yet.)

209
00:30:00,049 --> 00:30:01,079
(Why?)

210
00:30:01,719 --> 00:30:02,832
(I fell in love with someone,)

211
00:30:03,479 --> 00:30:04,913
(but he hasn't fallen in love with me yet.)

212
00:30:05,359 --> 00:30:07,312
(But one day, he will love me.)

213
00:30:07,479 --> 00:30:09,513
(And he'll love me to death.)

214
00:30:17,212 --> 00:30:17,914
Spirit particle.

215
00:30:19,124 --> 00:30:19,881
If...

216
00:30:20,839 --> 00:30:22,312
If Suiyue Mountain is gone,

217
00:30:23,479 --> 00:30:25,072
will the sacrificial formation also be gone?

218
00:30:27,160 --> 00:30:28,993
(Then let me destroy Suiyue Mountain.)

219
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:35,802
But you never

220
00:30:38,784 --> 00:30:41,657
loved me.

221
00:31:20,592 --> 00:31:21,802
Chang Yue.

222
00:32:13,100 --> 00:32:14,100
It's His Highness.

223
00:33:38,140 --> 00:33:39,140
(Chang Yue,)

224
00:33:40,920 --> 00:33:41,920
(is that you?)

225
00:33:42,706 --> 00:33:43,407
Yuan Bao.
