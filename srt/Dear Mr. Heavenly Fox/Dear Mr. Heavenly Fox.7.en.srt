00:01:48,836 --> 00:01:53,970
(Dear Mr. Heavenly Fox)

2
00:01:54,051 --> 00:01:57,024
(Episode 7)

3
00:02:02,006 --> 00:02:05,196
I wonder where Su Shen Shen ran off to.

4
00:02:05,279 --> 00:02:06,762
She has not come back.

5
00:02:11,685 --> 00:02:13,042
Master.

6
00:02:14,360 --> 00:02:16,242
How is

7
00:02:17,679 --> 00:02:19,362
your injury?

8
00:02:28,679 --> 00:02:30,202
You can have this.

9
00:02:32,160 --> 00:02:33,402
Thank you.

10
00:02:39,199 --> 00:02:42,322
You know, this place is beautiful,

11
00:02:42,600 --> 00:02:46,123
but what do we do if those monster flowers appear again?

12
00:02:46,271 --> 00:02:48,744
I am regretting it a little now.

13
00:02:53,320 --> 00:02:54,522
Regretting what?

14
00:02:55,360 --> 00:02:56,513
I said

15
00:02:56,623 --> 00:02:58,602
I would find the answer at the cost of my life.

16
00:02:58,720 --> 00:02:59,953
But now,

17
00:03:00,199 --> 00:03:02,642
nothing is more important than surviving.

18
00:03:02,839 --> 00:03:04,313
If I die,

19
00:03:04,479 --> 00:03:06,162
how can I find the answer, right?

20
00:03:07,800 --> 00:03:09,002
And Father

21
00:03:09,399 --> 00:03:12,122
must be worried sick about me now.

22
00:03:12,440 --> 00:03:14,162
He must be looking for me everywhere.

23
00:03:15,119 --> 00:03:17,242
It's never too late to grow as a person.

24
00:03:17,440 --> 00:03:18,722
Get some rest tonight.

25
00:03:18,839 --> 00:03:19,962
After we have rested,

26
00:03:20,080 --> 00:03:22,002
we will think of a way out tomorrow.

27
00:03:25,759 --> 00:03:26,759
Dig in.

28
00:03:58,800 --> 00:04:00,242
All right. You won't die.

29
00:04:01,103 --> 00:04:02,704
- It hurts!   - It should hurt.

30
00:04:02,815 --> 00:04:04,282
It means the venom is gone.

31
00:04:07,953 --> 00:04:10,722
You always carry so much medicine with you?

32
00:04:11,839 --> 00:04:14,482
Yuan Bao has been running around since she was a kid.

33
00:04:14,800 --> 00:04:16,362
She gets scratches here and there.

34
00:04:17,493 --> 00:04:18,398
These medicines

35
00:04:18,951 --> 00:04:20,362
are our contingency plans.

36
00:04:25,839 --> 00:04:27,232
Anyway, Second Young Lady Su,

37
00:04:27,359 --> 00:04:28,682
be careful.

38
00:04:33,279 --> 00:04:34,759
Okay. It is getting late.

39
00:04:34,846 --> 00:04:36,082
Let's go.

40
00:04:40,440 --> 00:04:41,440
What?

41
00:04:52,760 --> 00:04:54,122
You want me to

42
00:04:55,119 --> 00:04:56,119
carry you?

43
00:04:59,320 --> 00:05:02,122
I remember that someone was mocking me

44
00:05:02,359 --> 00:05:03,642
during the day.

45
00:05:05,079 --> 00:05:06,079
Listen.

46
00:05:07,440 --> 00:05:08,562
Carry you?

47
00:05:08,720 --> 00:05:10,072
Impossible!

48
00:05:18,200 --> 00:05:18,998
Xue Han Yu,

49
00:05:19,600 --> 00:05:21,952
you are not so useless after all.

50
00:05:23,559 --> 00:05:24,590
Second Young Lady Su,

51
00:05:25,079 --> 00:05:26,596
if you do not know how to praise someone,

52
00:05:26,621 --> 00:05:28,584
please shut up, okay?

53
00:05:32,679 --> 00:05:34,080
Come. Choke me.

54
00:05:34,183 --> 00:05:35,725
Choke me and you'll stay here alone.

55
00:05:42,279 --> 00:05:43,522
Thank you.

56
00:05:43,929 --> 00:05:45,322
You are welcome.

57
00:05:51,880 --> 00:05:53,202
Xue Han Yu,

58
00:05:53,399 --> 00:05:54,512
after leaving this forest,

59
00:05:54,640 --> 00:05:56,282
will you return to Qishan Sect?

60
00:05:56,699 --> 00:05:57,962
I'm not allowed to.

61
00:05:58,760 --> 00:06:00,162
Yuan Bao is missing.

62
00:06:00,517 --> 00:06:01,749
If I go back now,

63
00:06:01,880 --> 00:06:04,082
Uncle Qi will definitely break my legs.

64
00:06:05,067 --> 00:06:06,067
That is terrible.

65
00:06:06,295 --> 00:06:07,929
Then are you homeless now?

66
00:06:17,160 --> 00:06:20,512
I mean, a man

67
00:06:20,679 --> 00:06:23,322
considers the world his home anyway.

68
00:06:23,720 --> 00:06:25,633
My home is quite big.

69
00:06:25,760 --> 00:06:27,436
I can take you in if you need help.

70
00:06:27,534 --> 00:06:28,922
You can be my pet.

71
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:36,160
- Why would I want that?   - Why not?

72
00:06:36,320 --> 00:06:38,762
Suyun City is much better than Beixuan City.

73
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:41,232
We have the most fragrant roasted chicken,

74
00:06:41,433 --> 00:06:42,625
the most delicious flat bread,

75
00:06:42,760 --> 00:06:44,633
and the most mouth-watering roasted goose.

76
00:06:44,815 --> 00:06:46,922
Are you a pig? You only care about food.

77
00:06:47,679 --> 00:06:48,762
I don't want to go there.

78
00:06:48,895 --> 00:06:50,162
I need to find Yuan Bao.

79
00:06:50,600 --> 00:06:51,724
Uncle Qi said

80
00:06:51,880 --> 00:06:53,962
that Yuan Bao was in danger.

81
00:06:54,279 --> 00:06:56,362
I must find her and protect her.

82
00:06:58,040 --> 00:06:59,282
Do not worry.

83
00:06:59,480 --> 00:07:00,762
As the saying goes,

84
00:07:00,959 --> 00:07:02,042
a menace lives long.

85
00:07:02,160 --> 00:07:03,442
Yuan Bao will not die.

86
00:07:04,079 --> 00:07:06,202
If you say that again, I will drop you.

87
00:07:09,600 --> 00:07:11,562
A menace lives long. Yuan Bao will not die.

88
00:07:13,605 --> 00:07:14,882
What are you doing?

89
00:07:15,920 --> 00:07:17,202
I almost fell.

90
00:07:28,799 --> 00:07:30,202
We have been searching for a day.

91
00:07:30,320 --> 00:07:32,079
Let us rest at this inn for a while.

92
00:07:32,279 --> 00:07:33,279
Qi Huan,

93
00:07:33,440 --> 00:07:35,440
give the antidote to the poisoned disciples later.

94
00:07:35,720 --> 00:07:36,720
Noted.

95
00:08:11,640 --> 00:08:13,882
Mr. Immortal.

96
00:08:17,480 --> 00:08:18,922
Address me properly.

97
00:08:20,558 --> 00:08:21,873
Master.

98
00:09:06,393 --> 00:09:07,722
Who's there?

99
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:19,602
You are still worried about Young Lady.

100
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:22,362
There are dangers everywhere outside.

101
00:09:23,159 --> 00:09:24,922
I cannot sleep or eat in peace.

102
00:09:25,239 --> 00:09:27,082
Young Lady has always been smart and clever.

103
00:09:27,599 --> 00:09:28,762
She also

104
00:09:28,919 --> 00:09:30,762
has Mr. Chang Yue by her side.

105
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:32,232
Nothing will happen to her.

106
00:09:33,760 --> 00:09:35,792
I can only hope so.

107
00:09:36,440 --> 00:09:37,842
I am afraid

108
00:09:38,528 --> 00:09:41,082
that things have already gone far beyond my control.

109
00:09:41,174 --> 00:09:42,174
Besides...

110
00:09:42,679 --> 00:09:43,679
Besides what?

111
00:09:47,840 --> 00:09:49,552
I think I saw her today.

112
00:09:49,760 --> 00:09:50,318
Who?

113
00:09:52,496 --> 00:09:53,376
Meng Shu.

114
00:09:53,599 --> 00:09:55,042
Perhaps you saw wrong.

115
00:09:55,239 --> 00:09:56,762
I wish.

116
00:09:57,080 --> 00:09:58,276
Tell the searching disciples

117
00:09:58,421 --> 00:10:00,255
to report back immediately if they have any news.

118
00:10:01,279 --> 00:10:01,929
Noted.

119
00:10:38,280 --> 00:10:42,112
(He is so handsome.)

120
00:11:30,640 --> 00:11:33,482
Good morning.

121
00:12:01,280 --> 00:12:02,280
You...

122
00:12:03,365 --> 00:12:04,365
You...

123
00:12:05,774 --> 00:12:07,008
When did you come back?

124
00:12:07,159 --> 00:12:08,159
A long time ago.

125
00:12:08,309 --> 00:12:10,786
Then why did you not say anything? You scared me.

126
00:12:11,820 --> 00:12:14,220
You guys did not notice me, okay?

127
00:12:17,559 --> 00:12:19,076
The view over there looks pretty good.

128
00:12:19,174 --> 00:12:20,482
I am going to check it out.

129
00:12:25,679 --> 00:12:26,962
Good morning.

130
00:12:31,427 --> 00:12:33,362
What the heck?

131
00:12:50,479 --> 00:12:51,479
A rabbit!

132
00:12:53,386 --> 00:12:54,562
A rabbit!

133
00:13:17,280 --> 00:13:19,282
Yuan Bao, why did you do that?

134
00:13:19,527 --> 00:13:20,802
How can you be so cruel?

135
00:13:20,884 --> 00:13:23,082
Rabbits are so cute. Why did you take their blood?

136
00:13:23,926 --> 00:13:24,958
You feel bad for the rabbits?

137
00:13:25,119 --> 00:13:27,232
Do you want to donate some blood then?

138
00:13:27,400 --> 00:13:28,400
You...

139
00:13:29,239 --> 00:13:30,642
Master, let us go back.

140
00:13:52,919 --> 00:13:55,000
Sure enough, here it comes again.

141
00:13:59,760 --> 00:14:01,442
Master, it is up to you now.

142
00:14:07,732 --> 00:14:08,617
Master!

143
00:14:10,113 --> 00:14:11,595
Mr. Chang Yue, are you okay?

144
00:14:12,313 --> 00:14:13,482
I am okay.

145
00:14:14,440 --> 00:14:15,552
What is this thing?

146
00:14:15,633 --> 00:14:17,082
Even Huasheng Sword can't hurt it.

147
00:14:17,280 --> 00:14:19,002
It seems we need to find its weakness.

148
00:14:23,951 --> 00:14:24,951
I have an idea.

149
00:14:25,039 --> 00:14:27,082
Master, its mouth is the weakness.

150
00:14:28,119 --> 00:14:29,119
I see.

151
00:14:38,304 --> 00:14:40,362
- Mr. Chang Yue.   - Master.

152
00:14:55,749 --> 00:14:57,382
Great! We finally found a way out.

153
00:14:57,520 --> 00:14:59,198
Let us leave and find a place to rest.

154
00:15:15,159 --> 00:15:16,322
Finally!

155
00:15:16,663 --> 00:15:18,776
This forest is creepy.

156
00:15:20,239 --> 00:15:22,082
I wonder if Shen Shen and others made it out.

157
00:15:22,520 --> 00:15:24,513
Either way, let us find a place to stay first.

158
00:15:25,760 --> 00:15:27,399
- Let us go.   - Charge!

159
00:15:27,494 --> 00:15:28,494
Quick.

160
00:15:35,159 --> 00:15:36,159
Master!

161
00:15:36,255 --> 00:15:37,522
Quick. Come.

162
00:15:40,280 --> 00:15:41,562
Master!

163
00:15:41,960 --> 00:15:42,960
Hurry.

164
00:15:45,559 --> 00:15:46,959
- Let's go there.   - Have you seen her?

165
00:15:47,054 --> 00:15:48,054
No.

166
00:15:52,080 --> 00:15:53,080
Have you seen this woman?

167
00:15:53,161 --> 00:15:54,322
I have not seen her.

168
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:01,000
Have you seen this woman?

169
00:16:01,080 --> 00:16:02,080
I have not.

170
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:08,359
- Excuse me. Have you seen this woman?   - No.

171
00:16:09,719 --> 00:16:11,162
- Over there.   - Have you seen her?

172
00:16:11,280 --> 00:16:12,280
No.

173
00:16:12,403 --> 00:16:14,242
Excuse me. Have you seen this woman?

174
00:16:14,520 --> 00:16:15,722
I have not.

175
00:16:16,559 --> 00:16:17,802
That was close.

176
00:16:21,400 --> 00:16:23,002
You don't plan to return to Qishan Sect?

177
00:16:24,280 --> 00:16:25,357
I finally got out.

178
00:16:25,382 --> 00:16:26,272
Why go back?

179
00:16:26,760 --> 00:16:28,385
But it's dangerous out here alone.

180
00:16:29,320 --> 00:16:30,792
You're right.

181
00:16:31,440 --> 00:16:33,962
After all, the three of us draw attention.

182
00:16:39,520 --> 00:16:41,002
Then where do you want to go?

183
00:16:42,080 --> 00:16:44,362
I'll just go wherever destiny takes me.

184
00:16:44,679 --> 00:16:46,602
But I know you're a busy woman.

185
00:16:46,760 --> 00:16:48,404
Let's part ways here.

186
00:16:48,485 --> 00:16:49,607
Let's go, Master.

187
00:16:49,688 --> 00:16:50,688
Yuan Bao.

188
00:17:00,320 --> 00:17:01,320
Yuan Bao.

189
00:17:02,280 --> 00:17:03,957
I have something I want to discuss with you.

190
00:17:04,063 --> 00:17:05,063
Come here for a moment.

191
00:17:08,280 --> 00:17:09,280
Oh.

192
00:17:12,760 --> 00:17:14,592
What is it? You're being cryptic.

193
00:17:16,839 --> 00:17:17,839
Tell me.

194
00:17:18,786 --> 00:17:21,322
Do you fancy Mr. Chang Yue?

195
00:17:21,951 --> 00:17:23,458
Do I fancy Chang Yue?

196
00:17:23,959 --> 00:17:24,678
I...

197
00:17:30,878 --> 00:17:31,757
I got it right.

198
00:17:31,959 --> 00:17:32,763
No!

199
00:17:33,246 --> 00:17:35,934
I like a free-spirited, elegant,

200
00:17:35,966 --> 00:17:36,866
and learned man.

201
00:17:37,079 --> 00:17:38,557
He should also look

202
00:17:38,671 --> 00:17:39,939
a bit vulnerable.

203
00:17:40,344 --> 00:17:42,661
Why would I fancy someone like my master?

204
00:17:42,742 --> 00:17:44,014
He's dull and taciturn.

205
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:48,362
You shouldn't compare Mr. Chang Yue

206
00:17:48,640 --> 00:17:49,962
to those entertainers.

207
00:17:50,052 --> 00:17:50,765
I...

208
00:17:55,640 --> 00:17:56,640
Hold on.

209
00:17:59,102 --> 00:18:00,882
Why are you suddenly asking me this?

210
00:18:01,959 --> 00:18:02,959
I...

211
00:18:04,280 --> 00:18:05,359
You fancy my master?

212
00:18:05,470 --> 00:18:06,470
No!

213
00:18:07,512 --> 00:18:11,202
I just want to travel with you guys.

214
00:18:15,919 --> 00:18:19,192
If you like to roam around, I can keep you company.

215
00:18:23,784 --> 00:18:24,657
Sure.

216
00:18:25,040 --> 00:18:27,042
It's a public street.

217
00:18:27,239 --> 00:18:28,553
If I can walk on it,

218
00:18:28,719 --> 00:18:30,042
I can't stop you either.

219
00:18:30,800 --> 00:18:31,800
Then it is settled.

220
00:18:35,239 --> 00:18:36,239
Master.

221
00:18:36,320 --> 00:18:38,593
From now on, Young Lady Su will be traveling with us.

222
00:18:41,800 --> 00:18:44,952
You won't ask why?

223
00:18:45,199 --> 00:18:46,402
It is none of my concern.

224
00:18:46,560 --> 00:18:47,560
Why should I pry?

225
00:18:50,880 --> 00:18:52,800
See? I told you my master

226
00:18:52,911 --> 00:18:54,242
is dull and boring.

227
00:18:55,400 --> 00:18:56,400
Let's go.

228
00:19:19,760 --> 00:19:21,242
I wonder where His Highness has gone.

229
00:19:21,400 --> 00:19:22,553
He has not returned.

230
00:19:28,839 --> 00:19:31,722
(I am with Yuan Bao. Do not worry about me.)

231
00:19:32,319 --> 00:19:34,202
So he is with Yuan Bao.

232
00:19:34,479 --> 00:19:36,477
It seems like His Highness's in-tandem cultivation

233
00:19:36,622 --> 00:19:37,962
will succeed soon.

234
00:19:54,919 --> 00:19:55,919
Right.

235
00:19:56,040 --> 00:19:57,482
This is a mark left by Yuan Bao.

236
00:19:58,359 --> 00:20:00,762
Bunny, it seems Yuan Bao went in this direction.

237
00:20:01,520 --> 00:20:02,762
Xue Han Yu.

238
00:20:10,439 --> 00:20:11,682
What are you hiding?

239
00:20:12,040 --> 00:20:14,162
What am I hiding?

240
00:20:14,439 --> 00:20:16,682
I am dancing.

241
00:20:17,119 --> 00:20:18,482
Is it wrong for me to dance?

242
00:20:19,239 --> 00:20:20,778
There's something wrong with your brain.

243
00:20:21,520 --> 00:20:23,218
Your leg is healed? You can walk now?

244
00:20:24,319 --> 00:20:25,098
No.

245
00:20:25,880 --> 00:20:29,202
I thought you left me since you did not come back.

246
00:20:29,520 --> 00:20:30,682
I would love to do that.

247
00:20:30,880 --> 00:20:31,592
Say what?

248
00:20:32,680 --> 00:20:34,165
- Let's go.   - What?

249
00:20:34,560 --> 00:20:35,362
Let's go.

250
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:38,988
I said, let's go.

251
00:20:55,800 --> 00:20:57,680
So greedy. Hop on.

252
00:21:00,119 --> 00:21:01,153
You're heavier.

253
00:21:01,239 --> 00:21:02,239
What did you eat just now?

254
00:21:02,334 --> 00:21:03,648
What can I eat here?

255
00:21:12,119 --> 00:21:13,802
We have been walking for so long.

256
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:15,880
Disciples from Qishan Sect won't catch up so easily.

257
00:21:16,119 --> 00:21:18,322
Should we find an accommodation?

258
00:21:18,666 --> 00:21:20,442
Master, what do you think?

259
00:21:21,319 --> 00:21:22,319
Sure.

260
00:21:22,680 --> 00:21:23,680
All right.

261
00:21:25,776 --> 00:21:26,893
There seems to be an inn ahead.

262
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:28,322
Let's take a look.

263
00:21:28,959 --> 00:21:29,959
Okay.

264
00:21:31,239 --> 00:21:32,952
Master, walk faster.

265
00:21:36,680 --> 00:21:37,680
We are here.

266
00:21:47,257 --> 00:21:48,257
Welcome.

267
00:21:48,344 --> 00:21:49,825
Mister, do you still have rooms?

268
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:52,072
We do. How many rooms do you need?

269
00:21:53,280 --> 00:21:54,482
One room each.

270
00:21:54,719 --> 00:21:55,952
Okay, three rooms.

271
00:21:56,157 --> 00:21:57,343
- This way, please.   - Wait.

272
00:21:59,119 --> 00:22:01,993
Two rooms will do.

273
00:22:02,089 --> 00:22:03,162
One room for my master.

274
00:22:03,319 --> 00:22:04,319
You and I will share one.

275
00:22:04,400 --> 00:22:06,440
- Is that okay with you, Master?   - Sure.

276
00:22:06,880 --> 00:22:08,202
Show us the way.

277
00:22:08,319 --> 00:22:09,825
Yuan Bao. Wait.

278
00:22:12,400 --> 00:22:13,962
I do not sleep very well.

279
00:22:14,199 --> 00:22:15,522
I might disturb you at night.

280
00:22:15,742 --> 00:22:17,882
It's fine. I do not mind the noise. Let's go.

281
00:22:19,560 --> 00:22:21,396
I am not used

282
00:22:21,487 --> 00:22:23,322
to sharing a room with others.

283
00:22:24,040 --> 00:22:26,996
We might travel far,

284
00:22:27,157 --> 00:22:30,202
so we should save as much money as possible.

285
00:22:30,920 --> 00:22:32,562
You'll have to make do

286
00:22:32,760 --> 00:22:35,472
with an uncouth person like me.

287
00:22:36,400 --> 00:22:37,922
- Let's go.   - Okay.

288
00:22:40,640 --> 00:22:41,802
Young Lady Su.

289
00:22:43,079 --> 00:22:45,122
Why are you standing there? Come.

290
00:22:46,959 --> 00:22:48,682
(Forget it. I'm sure there is another opportunity)

291
00:22:48,763 --> 00:22:50,122
(to update Yun Rong.)

292
00:22:53,119 --> 00:22:54,362
Okay.

293
00:22:54,622 --> 00:22:56,583
- Let's go, Master.   - This way, please.

294
00:22:57,760 --> 00:22:58,760
Here.

295
00:23:01,760 --> 00:23:02,760
Please.

296
00:23:03,680 --> 00:23:05,082
Miss, this way.

297
00:23:07,560 --> 00:23:08,882
You don't trust her.

298
00:23:12,560 --> 00:23:13,560
Be cautious.

299
00:23:15,239 --> 00:23:15,799
Do not worry.

300
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:21,000
Have you seen this woman?

301
00:23:21,079 --> 00:23:22,472
Excuse me, have you seen this woman?

302
00:23:22,640 --> 00:23:23,640
Have you seen this woman?

303
00:23:29,040 --> 00:23:29,528
Come in.

304
00:23:31,800 --> 00:23:32,922
Is there any news?

305
00:23:33,160 --> 00:23:36,153
Sir, we still have not found any traces of Qi Yuan Bao.

306
00:23:36,359 --> 00:23:37,993
Nothing new from Qishan Sect either.

307
00:23:40,439 --> 00:23:41,439
Continue.

308
00:23:41,520 --> 00:23:42,520
Noted.

309
00:23:46,160 --> 00:23:48,402
(Why hasn't Shen sent us the signal?)

310
00:23:48,760 --> 00:23:50,913
(Could something have happened to her?)

311
00:23:52,359 --> 00:23:53,722
She is this tall.

312
00:23:54,079 --> 00:23:55,242
Let's go there and ask.

313
00:23:55,479 --> 00:23:56,479
Have you seen her?

314
00:23:57,186 --> 00:23:58,722
Miss, have you seen her?

315
00:23:58,954 --> 00:24:00,275
- Have you seen her?   - No.

316
00:24:00,449 --> 00:24:01,449
- Have you seen her?   - No.

317
00:24:01,560 --> 00:24:03,079
- She's this tall.   - No.

318
00:24:06,760 --> 00:24:07,760
Sir.

319
00:24:07,880 --> 00:24:08,880
Sir.

320
00:24:09,119 --> 00:24:10,192
We have searched everywhere.

321
00:24:10,400 --> 00:24:11,913
There is no news of Young Lady.

322
00:24:12,079 --> 00:24:13,592
Has she left the city?

323
00:24:14,479 --> 00:24:15,479
Very likely.

324
00:24:15,839 --> 00:24:16,913
If she were still in the city,

325
00:24:17,079 --> 00:24:19,442
our disciples would have found her already.

326
00:24:21,800 --> 00:24:23,682
She has never traveled far in her life.

327
00:24:23,887 --> 00:24:25,442
If she has left Beixuan City,

328
00:24:25,672 --> 00:24:27,002
where could she have gone?

329
00:24:27,920 --> 00:24:31,402
Perhaps she went to Suiyue Mountain to find Shu Ya?

330
00:24:31,914 --> 00:24:33,122
Probably.

331
00:24:34,089 --> 00:24:36,082
If that is the case, then it is terrible.

332
00:24:36,719 --> 00:24:38,562
She has Tianji Jade Pendant.

333
00:24:38,660 --> 00:24:39,445
I...

334
00:24:40,479 --> 00:24:41,305
No.

335
00:24:41,760 --> 00:24:44,040
I have to go to Suiyue Mountain to stop Yuan Bao.

336
00:24:44,680 --> 00:24:45,680
Write to Shu Ya and have him

337
00:24:45,760 --> 00:24:47,520
pay close attention to Yuan Bao's whereabouts.

338
00:24:47,766 --> 00:24:48,363
Noted.

339
00:26:16,450 --> 00:26:17,802
Mother.

340
00:26:21,044 --> 00:26:25,122
Mother, don't go.

341
00:26:27,239 --> 00:26:28,922
Don't go.

342
00:26:31,209 --> 00:26:32,402
(This girl.)

343
00:26:32,762 --> 00:26:34,362
(Is she truly asleep)

344
00:26:34,719 --> 00:26:36,282
(or is this an act?)

345
00:26:51,038 --> 00:26:52,038
Good morning, Master.

346
00:26:52,149 --> 00:26:53,583
Good morning, Mr. Chang Yue.

347
00:26:54,119 --> 00:26:56,513
- Did you have a good sleep?   - I feel refreshed.

348
00:26:57,160 --> 00:26:58,160
You slept well,

349
00:26:58,239 --> 00:27:00,162
but do I look like I slept well?

350
00:27:00,520 --> 00:27:02,482
Good morning. Here is your breakfast.

351
00:27:05,160 --> 00:27:06,802
- This is yours.   - Thank you.

352
00:27:07,359 --> 00:27:08,646
- This is yours.   - Thank you.

353
00:27:12,199 --> 00:27:13,522
Enjoy your meal.

354
00:27:15,640 --> 00:27:17,146
- Here.   - Thank you, Master.

355
00:27:19,846 --> 00:27:20,966
Thank you, Mr. Chang Yue.

356
00:27:32,760 --> 00:27:34,082
Eat more.

357
00:27:37,319 --> 00:27:38,319
Thank you, Master.

358
00:27:38,399 --> 00:27:39,682
Mr. Chang Yue.

359
00:27:39,920 --> 00:27:40,920
Try this.

360
00:27:41,040 --> 00:27:42,602
It's the signature dish here.

361
00:27:59,160 --> 00:28:00,362
You can have it.

362
00:28:00,800 --> 00:28:02,400
Master, you don't want it?

363
00:28:04,160 --> 00:28:05,762
I'll gladly accept it.

364
00:28:15,839 --> 00:28:18,242
Master, I know you care about me.

365
00:28:19,359 --> 00:28:21,793
But for some reason, I do not want

366
00:28:21,888 --> 00:28:24,122
to eat chicken drumsticks this morning.

367
00:28:29,400 --> 00:28:30,802
Master, have this.

368
00:28:30,920 --> 00:28:32,322
I don't need it. Eat it.

369
00:28:34,599 --> 00:28:36,002
Mr. Chang Yue.

370
00:28:36,479 --> 00:28:37,922
Try this too.

371
00:28:39,079 --> 00:28:40,282
Thank you.

372
00:28:45,692 --> 00:28:46,692
You can have...

373
00:28:50,199 --> 00:28:52,882
Master, this bowl is enough.

374
00:28:53,012 --> 00:28:55,178
Don't worry. You can have it.

375
00:28:55,239 --> 00:28:56,108
Enjoy.
