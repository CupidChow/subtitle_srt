1
00:01:48,802 --> 00:01:53,955
(Dear Mr. Heavenly Fox)

2
00:01:54,068 --> 00:01:57,010
(Episode 19)

3
00:02:11,679 --> 00:02:12,679
Chang Yue.

4
00:02:13,199 --> 00:02:14,199
Dos this

5
00:02:15,160 --> 00:02:16,593
make you feel any better?

6
00:02:32,479 --> 00:02:35,313
There's nothing left to say between us.

7
00:02:36,399 --> 00:02:38,682
No need to put on a show here.

8
00:02:39,718 --> 00:02:41,103
I give you one day

9
00:02:41,574 --> 00:02:43,282
to leave Beiming's territory.

10
00:02:44,097 --> 00:02:44,823
Chang Yue.

11
00:02:46,173 --> 00:02:46,936
Chang Yue.

12
00:02:48,360 --> 00:02:49,682
Chang Yue.

13
00:02:51,240 --> 00:02:52,752
Chang Yue!

14
00:02:53,520 --> 00:02:54,520
Chang Yue.

15
00:02:56,679 --> 00:02:57,679
Chang Yue!

16
00:03:00,679 --> 00:03:01,679
Guards!

17
00:03:01,880 --> 00:03:03,720
Take this woman

18
00:03:03,800 --> 00:03:04,800
to the jail.

19
00:03:26,119 --> 00:03:27,233
What the heck is this place?

20
00:03:28,360 --> 00:03:29,472
Why is it so cold?

21
00:03:34,600 --> 00:03:35,600
I won't

22
00:03:36,320 --> 00:03:38,192
freeze to death here

23
00:03:38,960 --> 00:03:40,912
before I see Chang Yue, will I?

24
00:03:47,360 --> 00:03:49,672
Qi Yuan Bao suddenly barged into Beiming.

25
00:03:50,119 --> 00:03:51,233
What do you think of this?

26
00:03:51,440 --> 00:03:53,513
I don't think it's a bad thing.

27
00:03:54,360 --> 00:03:56,433
While Chang Yue was indeed injured by her,

28
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:58,032
no matter what,

29
00:03:58,600 --> 00:04:00,233
his soul is still in her.

30
00:04:01,119 --> 00:04:02,119
She

31
00:04:02,199 --> 00:04:03,593
came here herself.

32
00:04:04,320 --> 00:04:05,392
It's a good thing

33
00:04:05,759 --> 00:04:06,873
for our clan

34
00:04:07,199 --> 00:04:08,713
and for Chang Yue.

35
00:04:09,639 --> 00:04:12,192
I think we should just lock her up,

36
00:04:12,360 --> 00:04:13,379
give her a small punishment,

37
00:04:13,639 --> 00:04:15,313
and let her out tomorrow.

38
00:04:16,839 --> 00:04:18,473
Just that?

39
00:04:19,559 --> 00:04:21,153
It won't ease the resentment in my heart.

40
00:04:21,720 --> 00:04:23,193
I'm angry too.

41
00:04:23,760 --> 00:04:24,760
But think about it,

42
00:04:25,385 --> 00:04:27,352
If we don't let her out soon

43
00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:28,800
how will Chang Yue

44
00:04:28,880 --> 00:04:30,392
get his soul back soon?

45
00:04:30,799 --> 00:04:31,799
Besides,

46
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:33,633
she is in Beiming's territory.

47
00:04:33,799 --> 00:04:35,552
She can't cause any trouble

48
00:04:35,799 --> 00:04:37,153
like she did in the mortal realm.

49
00:04:37,480 --> 00:04:39,392
Maybe this is Chang Yue's destiny.

50
00:04:41,320 --> 00:04:42,508
We can't change it.

51
00:05:19,959 --> 00:05:20,959
Chang...

52
00:05:27,839 --> 00:05:29,873
You're the woman who hurt Chang Yue?

53
00:05:34,679 --> 00:05:36,159
Small nose. Small eyes

54
00:05:36,239 --> 00:05:37,633
Not even a single pleasing feature.

55
00:05:38,600 --> 00:05:39,753
You're hideous.

56
00:05:45,320 --> 00:05:46,433
I'm hideous?

57
00:05:46,959 --> 00:05:48,272
What are you then?

58
00:05:48,399 --> 00:05:49,753
You've asked the right question.

59
00:05:52,799 --> 00:05:53,873
Let me tell you.

60
00:05:54,320 --> 00:05:55,719
I'm Yan Hong Zhen of Tianshan Cavern,

61
00:05:55,799 --> 00:05:58,401
renowned for beating scary and evil beasts.

62
00:05:58,481 --> 00:05:59,680
Even Hu Bu Lin has to call me

63
00:05:59,760 --> 00:06:02,633
Grandmaster.

64
00:06:03,600 --> 00:06:04,600
(I've never heard of him.)

65
00:06:08,559 --> 00:06:09,559
Impressive.

66
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:14,039
Although you're a bit ugly,

67
00:06:14,119 --> 00:06:15,352
you have good taste.

68
00:06:16,160 --> 00:06:17,832
Are you an idiot?

69
00:06:18,079 --> 00:06:19,839
You can't even tell it's sarcasm?

70
00:06:20,012 --> 00:06:21,012
You dare to scold me?

71
00:06:24,563 --> 00:06:25,563
You dare to hit me?

72
00:06:25,679 --> 00:06:26,679
Why not?

73
00:06:27,959 --> 00:06:28,959
Fine

74
00:06:29,320 --> 00:06:30,993
I'm in a bad mood anyway.

75
00:06:31,252 --> 00:06:32,253
If I don't punch you,

76
00:06:32,320 --> 00:06:33,125
I'll...

77
00:06:35,279 --> 00:06:36,753
What? Will you submit now?

78
00:06:37,079 --> 00:06:38,079
No.

79
00:06:38,799 --> 00:06:39,952
I won't submit to you!

80
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:43,000
Listen.

81
00:06:43,160 --> 00:06:44,279
I can crush

82
00:06:44,359 --> 00:06:45,952
someone like you with one finger.

83
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:48,512
(This guy is very strange.)

84
00:06:48,839 --> 00:06:49,993
(He doesn't look old)

85
00:06:50,200 --> 00:06:51,633
(but his spiritual power is strong.)

86
00:06:51,760 --> 00:06:52,760
(If this continues,)

87
00:06:52,840 --> 00:06:54,713
(I'm afraid I'll really die at his hands.)

88
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:56,000
I...

89
00:06:56,320 --> 00:06:57,993
I have Chang Yue's soul now.

90
00:06:58,320 --> 00:06:59,479
Before you crush me to death,

91
00:06:59,559 --> 00:07:00,832
you better think twice.

92
00:07:01,046 --> 00:07:02,046
Are you threatening me?

93
00:07:02,279 --> 00:07:03,313
I'm so scared.

94
00:07:03,959 --> 00:07:05,479
Whether you have Chang Yue's soul or not,

95
00:07:05,559 --> 00:07:07,519
if I want you dead, you die.

96
00:07:08,279 --> 00:07:10,392
Grandmaster. Grandmaster.

97
00:07:10,720 --> 00:07:12,360
I apologize. You are brave, extraordinary,

98
00:07:12,440 --> 00:07:13,440
and very generous.

99
00:07:13,519 --> 00:07:14,759
Forgive an ignorant girl like me.

100
00:07:14,839 --> 00:07:15,839
Let me go first.

101
00:07:15,920 --> 00:07:17,713
If you don't let me go, I will die soon.

102
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:27,033
(Even a predator will become prey one day.)

103
00:07:27,600 --> 00:07:29,072
(For Chang Yue,)

104
00:07:29,559 --> 00:07:30,879
(I'll put up with him.)

105
00:07:30,959 --> 00:07:32,279
(Once I get out,)

106
00:07:32,359 --> 00:07:33,359
(I will make him pay.)

107
00:07:43,079 --> 00:07:44,079
Don't look at me like that.

108
00:07:45,480 --> 00:07:47,520
Grandmaster, can I ask you a favor?

109
00:07:47,600 --> 00:07:48,879
You're so strong

110
00:07:48,959 --> 00:07:49,959
and powerful.

111
00:07:51,519 --> 00:07:53,039
- Can you take me away?   - Give you an inch

112
00:07:53,119 --> 00:07:54,119
and you take a mile.

113
00:07:57,040 --> 00:07:59,352
Grandmaster.

114
00:08:04,760 --> 00:08:06,640
Your Highness, Miss Yi Xuan is here to see you.

115
00:08:08,320 --> 00:08:09,320
Where is His Highness?

116
00:08:12,720 --> 00:08:13,960
He was just here.

117
00:08:14,040 --> 00:08:15,072
He disappeared suddenly.

118
00:08:16,506 --> 00:08:17,506
I...

119
00:08:21,720 --> 00:08:22,840
If you hadn't known your manners

120
00:08:22,920 --> 00:08:24,788
and called me Grandmaster respectfully,

121
00:08:24,920 --> 00:08:26,352
I would never have let you out.

122
00:08:26,600 --> 00:08:28,359
Yes, you are the most generous.

123
00:08:29,440 --> 00:08:30,440
Isn't it

124
00:08:30,778 --> 00:08:31,952
funny?

125
00:08:32,032 --> 00:08:33,105
Do you think it's funny or not?

126
00:08:33,757 --> 00:08:35,120
What are you two talking about?

127
00:08:35,200 --> 00:08:36,413
Share the joy with me.

128
00:08:36,919 --> 00:08:38,079
I remember what you two look like.

129
00:08:38,159 --> 00:08:39,313
Don't let me catch you.

130
00:08:40,039 --> 00:08:41,560
No wonder people ran away.

131
00:08:41,640 --> 00:08:43,152
You are too scary.

132
00:08:43,640 --> 00:08:45,280
I don't care. As long as I'm happy.

133
00:08:45,479 --> 00:08:46,873
Right.

134
00:08:47,440 --> 00:08:49,472
But you're not afraid of me at all.

135
00:08:49,960 --> 00:08:51,352
You're to my taste.

136
00:08:53,359 --> 00:08:55,352
(Who cares about your taste?)

137
00:08:57,640 --> 00:08:59,200
I just saw them

138
00:08:59,280 --> 00:09:01,152
calling you Your Highness.

139
00:09:01,599 --> 00:09:02,599
Do you

140
00:09:02,640 --> 00:09:04,472
have a high position in Beiming?

141
00:09:05,280 --> 00:09:06,352
How ignorant.

142
00:09:06,799 --> 00:09:08,959
Yes. I'm ignorant.

143
00:09:09,039 --> 00:09:10,112
I'm a country bumpkin.

144
00:09:10,520 --> 00:09:11,920
Then the esteemed

145
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:13,993
and knowledgeable Your Highness,

146
00:09:14,200 --> 00:09:15,393
can you tell me more?

147
00:09:16,039 --> 00:09:17,039
What do you want to know?

148
00:09:17,440 --> 00:09:19,792
There are so many palaces in Beiming.

149
00:09:19,919 --> 00:09:20,919
Which one is Chang Yue's?

150
00:09:21,799 --> 00:09:22,953
Oh, you hideous creature.

151
00:09:23,320 --> 00:09:24,320
I knew it.

152
00:09:24,400 --> 00:09:25,400
I will not tell you.

153
00:09:25,480 --> 00:09:26,480
Just give up.

154
00:09:26,560 --> 00:09:27,792
Please. Don't go!

155
00:09:28,119 --> 00:09:29,273
Please tell me!

156
00:09:29,599 --> 00:09:30,801
Why do you keep touching me?

157
00:09:30,881 --> 00:09:31,920
Please tell me!

158
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:33,361
Let go! Let go of me!

159
00:09:33,441 --> 00:09:35,320
Tell me where Chang Yue lives and I'll let go.

160
00:09:35,400 --> 00:09:37,159
Let go! What are you doing?

161
00:09:37,239 --> 00:09:38,400
- Tell me!   - Let go of me!

162
00:09:38,480 --> 00:09:39,985
Tell me, please! I beg of you.

163
00:09:41,760 --> 00:09:43,592
Chang Yue.

164
00:09:51,039 --> 00:09:52,472
Chang Yue!

165
00:09:55,359 --> 00:09:56,592
Ugly freak!

166
00:09:57,880 --> 00:09:59,513
Chang Yue!

167
00:10:01,239 --> 00:10:02,239
Chang Yue!

168
00:10:03,159 --> 00:10:03,952
Don't follow me.

169
00:10:11,127 --> 00:10:12,127
That hideous creature.

170
00:10:12,440 --> 00:10:13,440
Where did she run off to?

171
00:10:20,440 --> 00:10:21,440
Are you done?

172
00:10:23,359 --> 00:10:24,359
Don't come in.

173
00:11:11,520 --> 00:11:12,520
(Chang Yue.)

174
00:11:13,799 --> 00:11:15,273
(I'll be here waiting)

175
00:11:16,919 --> 00:11:18,513
(until you forgive me.)

176
00:11:36,359 --> 00:11:37,359
Chang Yue.

177
00:11:37,520 --> 00:11:38,633
Are you asleep?

178
00:11:46,640 --> 00:11:47,640
Chang Yue.

179
00:11:48,391 --> 00:11:49,391
I know

180
00:11:49,880 --> 00:11:51,232
you don't want to talk to me right now,

181
00:11:52,320 --> 00:11:55,032
But I have so much to tell you.

182
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:04,000
Do you know

183
00:12:04,559 --> 00:12:06,352
how I got to Beiming?

184
00:12:07,799 --> 00:12:09,873
I crossed a big river,

185
00:12:10,320 --> 00:12:11,873
trudged through a desert,

186
00:12:12,799 --> 00:12:14,560
and climbed

187
00:12:14,640 --> 00:12:16,313
a very tall mountain.

188
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:19,313
Then, for some reason,

189
00:12:19,559 --> 00:12:21,073
I fell into Beiming.

190
00:12:21,931 --> 00:12:22,931
Didn't you say

191
00:12:23,039 --> 00:12:25,672
humans couldn't pass through the fox clan's barrier?

192
00:12:26,640 --> 00:12:28,232
So what happened then?

193
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:30,112
I fell

194
00:12:30,640 --> 00:12:32,313
right into your arms.

195
00:12:33,679 --> 00:12:34,679
Oh, I know.

196
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:36,000
It must be because

197
00:12:36,039 --> 00:12:37,753
I have your soul inside me,

198
00:12:38,080 --> 00:12:39,200
so I can move freely

199
00:12:39,280 --> 00:12:40,280
in Beiming.

200
00:12:40,520 --> 00:12:41,712
That must be it, right?

201
00:12:42,880 --> 00:12:45,273
Oh, as for Xue Han Yu and Su Qian Qian,

202
00:12:46,080 --> 00:12:47,920
I don't know what's going on

203
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:49,193
with them lately.

204
00:12:49,760 --> 00:12:51,552
I always feel like something's off.

205
00:12:52,039 --> 00:12:54,073
They must be hiding something from me.

206
00:12:57,119 --> 00:12:58,119
(But)

207
00:12:58,520 --> 00:13:00,112
(what I want to tell you the most is)

208
00:13:01,119 --> 00:13:02,119
(I miss you.)

209
00:13:02,919 --> 00:13:03,919
Chang Yue.

210
00:13:05,479 --> 00:13:06,953
Are you asleep?

211
00:13:10,932 --> 00:13:11,778
Chang Yue.

212
00:13:26,520 --> 00:13:27,672
Don't cry.

213
00:14:09,200 --> 00:14:10,200
Grandmother Bi Xi.

214
00:14:10,320 --> 00:14:11,320
Grandmother Bi Xi.

215
00:14:11,679 --> 00:14:13,320
Prince Yan freed Miss Qi.

216
00:14:13,400 --> 00:14:15,193
She has gone to Prince Chang Yue's palace.

217
00:14:15,599 --> 00:14:16,599
Should we bring her back?

218
00:14:17,119 --> 00:14:18,119
Forget it.

219
00:14:18,200 --> 00:14:19,360
Chang Yue has to retrieve the soul

220
00:14:19,440 --> 00:14:20,440
eventually.

221
00:14:21,280 --> 00:14:22,472
Have Hu Bu Lin keep an eye on her.

222
00:14:22,654 --> 00:14:23,654
Don't let that woman

223
00:14:23,679 --> 00:14:24,679
hurt Chang Yue again.

224
00:14:24,760 --> 00:14:25,301
Noted.

225
00:14:28,880 --> 00:14:29,561
Oh, the bad karma.

226
00:14:40,359 --> 00:14:41,012
Chang Yue.

227
00:15:44,280 --> 00:15:45,280
Chang Yue.

228
00:15:46,200 --> 00:15:47,352
Does it still hurt?

229
00:16:13,559 --> 00:16:14,559
Quit pretending.

230
00:16:15,239 --> 00:16:16,239
It's not funny.

231
00:16:17,479 --> 00:16:18,479
Chang Yue.

232
00:16:18,679 --> 00:16:19,679
I came to...

233
00:16:31,719 --> 00:16:32,719
Chang Yue.

234
00:16:33,919 --> 00:16:35,912
I came to apologize to you.

235
00:16:37,239 --> 00:16:38,239
Do you know?

236
00:16:39,359 --> 00:16:40,792
I've been looking for you for a long time.

237
00:16:42,520 --> 00:16:43,792
And I've finally found you.

238
00:16:50,880 --> 00:16:51,880
- Hu Bu Lin.   - Chang Yue.

239
00:16:52,400 --> 00:16:53,712
Chang Yue.

240
00:16:54,039 --> 00:16:55,039
Stop.

241
00:16:55,760 --> 00:16:57,520
Don't pester His Highness anymore.

242
00:16:57,719 --> 00:16:59,400
His Highness is no longer interested in you.

243
00:16:59,760 --> 00:17:01,880
Just give up already.

244
00:17:02,015 --> 00:17:03,894
I just wanted to go to Chang Yue

245
00:17:03,919 --> 00:17:05,192
to apologize.

246
00:17:05,520 --> 00:17:06,205
It's too late.

247
00:17:22,680 --> 00:17:23,793
Beiming is so big.

248
00:17:25,079 --> 00:17:26,079
Where should I go?

249
00:17:28,119 --> 00:17:29,119
Chang Yue.

250
00:17:30,079 --> 00:17:31,273
It seems I can only

251
00:17:32,239 --> 00:17:33,279
spend the night

252
00:17:33,359 --> 00:17:34,359
at your door.

253
00:17:38,239 --> 00:17:39,592
It's really cold in Beiming.

254
00:17:40,746 --> 00:17:41,939
You must be Miss Qi.

255
00:17:47,959 --> 00:17:48,959
You're so pretty.

256
00:17:49,760 --> 00:17:50,760
You are...

257
00:17:51,719 --> 00:17:52,719
You flatter me, miss.

258
00:17:53,160 --> 00:17:54,160
I am Yi Xuan,

259
00:17:54,239 --> 00:17:55,352
a physician in Beiming.

260
00:17:59,640 --> 00:18:01,312
You seem to be seriously injured.

261
00:18:03,319 --> 00:18:05,112
I deserve it.

262
00:18:12,440 --> 00:18:13,078
I knew it.

263
00:18:13,520 --> 00:18:15,553
This robe really suits you.

264
00:18:18,680 --> 00:18:20,873
I've never dressed

265
00:18:21,040 --> 00:18:22,040
so ladylike before.

266
00:18:22,719 --> 00:18:24,119
- It feels so strange.   - Yi Xuan.

267
00:18:24,199 --> 00:18:25,759
I'm starving. What are you doing?

268
00:18:25,839 --> 00:18:26,839
Hong Zhen.

269
00:18:27,520 --> 00:18:28,520
I'm waiting for you to eat.

270
00:18:30,800 --> 00:18:32,359
Who is this? A new maid?

271
00:18:33,160 --> 00:18:34,472
How could she be a maid?

272
00:18:35,040 --> 00:18:36,279
She looks so familiar.

273
00:18:36,359 --> 00:18:37,433
Have we met somewhere before?

274
00:18:39,319 --> 00:18:41,200
Absolutely not..

275
00:18:41,280 --> 00:18:43,072
Your Highness, you mistook me for someone else.

276
00:18:49,439 --> 00:18:50,439
Take your hand away.

277
00:18:52,160 --> 00:18:53,712
It's you, the ugly freak.

278
00:18:55,359 --> 00:18:57,019
I almost didn't recognize you in this robe.

279
00:18:57,099 --> 00:18:58,131
You look better now.

280
00:18:58,280 --> 00:18:59,280
You two know each other?

281
00:18:59,359 --> 00:19:00,672
- Yes, we do.   - No, we don't.

282
00:19:03,520 --> 00:19:04,520
What do you mean?

283
00:19:05,199 --> 00:19:06,352
You've forgotten about me already?

284
00:19:06,707 --> 00:19:07,707
Shut up.

285
00:19:09,079 --> 00:19:10,879
It seems you two are very close.

286
00:19:10,959 --> 00:19:12,479
- What are you doing?   - It's all right.

287
00:19:13,199 --> 00:19:15,312
Miss Qi, I'll bring some food.

288
00:19:16,479 --> 00:19:17,959
Okay. Thank you.

289
00:19:21,239 --> 00:19:22,239
Ouch!

290
00:19:22,319 --> 00:19:23,352
How dare you!

291
00:19:23,680 --> 00:19:24,680
How dare you...

292
00:19:24,839 --> 00:19:25,840
How dare you silence me so?

293
00:19:25,920 --> 00:19:26,999
Let go first.

294
00:19:27,079 --> 00:19:28,119
You didn't know me, you said?

295
00:19:28,199 --> 00:19:29,199
I know you.

296
00:19:29,280 --> 00:19:31,080
- Didn't you say you didn't know me?   - I was wrong.

297
00:19:31,160 --> 00:19:32,160
Do you know your mistake now?

298
00:19:34,479 --> 00:19:35,479
Hurry up and eat.

299
00:19:38,079 --> 00:19:39,079
I can walk.

300
00:19:39,359 --> 00:19:40,359
Sit there.

301
00:19:40,520 --> 00:19:41,520
Eat.

302
00:19:43,680 --> 00:19:44,680
Sit down.

303
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:46,913
Letting you dine with me is an honor, okay?

304
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:49,399
My fortune of the day must be very bad.

305
00:19:49,479 --> 00:19:51,153
That's why I ran into a crazy man today.

306
00:19:51,239 --> 00:19:52,352
Once I've appeased Chang Yue,

307
00:19:52,439 --> 00:19:53,439
I will...

308
00:19:54,599 --> 00:19:56,712
But can I still appease Chang Yue?

309
00:20:00,959 --> 00:20:02,553
You and your pretty sister

310
00:20:03,319 --> 00:20:05,359
came from the same mother?

311
00:20:05,439 --> 00:20:06,681
- Of course.   - Then how can you two

312
00:20:06,761 --> 00:20:07,832
be so different?

313
00:20:07,920 --> 00:20:09,839
One is gentle and generous and the other is...

314
00:20:10,359 --> 00:20:11,359
The other is what?

315
00:20:12,560 --> 00:20:14,153
The other is of course

316
00:20:14,359 --> 00:20:16,192
mighty and extraordinary, handsome and dashing,

317
00:20:16,359 --> 00:20:17,359
romantic and suave.

318
00:20:20,479 --> 00:20:21,673
Although you're a bit ugly,

319
00:20:21,839 --> 00:20:23,673
what you say is quite pleasing to the ear.

320
00:20:26,079 --> 00:20:28,553
I don't know how you seduced Chang Yue like that.

321
00:20:29,319 --> 00:20:32,273
But after you get dressed up,

322
00:20:32,800 --> 00:20:33,832
you look presentable.

323
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:36,000
But that's about it.

324
00:20:39,800 --> 00:20:40,800
Can I ask you something?

325
00:20:41,319 --> 00:20:42,553
What exactly is your relationship

326
00:20:42,839 --> 00:20:43,952
with Chang Yue?

327
00:20:44,079 --> 00:20:45,079
We are...

328
00:20:47,765 --> 00:20:49,486
Why? It's none of your business.

329
00:20:49,719 --> 00:20:51,280
Let me tell you. You can forget about getting

330
00:20:51,360 --> 00:20:52,519
any information about Chang Yue.

331
00:20:52,599 --> 00:20:53,092
I...

332
00:20:55,719 --> 00:20:57,472
Your Highness Yan, don't pull me.

333
00:20:57,599 --> 00:20:59,352
Stop. Calling me Grandmaster every day won't work.

334
00:20:59,760 --> 00:21:01,639
You are an evil woman.

335
00:21:01,719 --> 00:21:02,720
If I let you approach him,

336
00:21:02,800 --> 00:21:04,719
you'll devour him until there's nothing left but bones.

337
00:21:06,920 --> 00:21:08,432
Fine, then I won't ask about Chang Yue.

338
00:21:08,760 --> 00:21:10,072
Then who is Grandmother Bi Xi?

339
00:21:10,719 --> 00:21:14,000
Is she the woman who threw me in jail today?

340
00:21:14,080 --> 00:21:15,759
Grandmother Bi Xi is in charge of Beiming.

341
00:21:15,839 --> 00:21:16,839
We were all brought up

342
00:21:16,920 --> 00:21:18,352
by her.

343
00:21:19,040 --> 00:21:20,040
Chang Yue

344
00:21:20,160 --> 00:21:21,465
is her favorite child.

345
00:21:22,160 --> 00:21:23,192
(I see.)

346
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:25,673
(So her throwing me in jail today)

347
00:21:26,040 --> 00:21:27,712
(was already a show of clemency.)

348
00:21:29,079 --> 00:21:30,472
What about Chang Yue's parents?

349
00:21:30,599 --> 00:21:31,599
They died long ago.

350
00:21:34,920 --> 00:21:36,712
No wonder Chang Yue always seems

351
00:21:37,199 --> 00:21:38,199
so aloof.

352
00:21:39,611 --> 00:21:40,611
Miss Qi,

353
00:21:41,079 --> 00:21:42,079
have a pastry.

354
00:21:42,479 --> 00:21:43,479
It's very delicious.

355
00:21:43,560 --> 00:21:45,479
Does Chang Yue have any friends?

356
00:21:45,599 --> 00:21:47,200
Does he have many friends? What does he

357
00:21:47,280 --> 00:21:48,280
usually like to do?

358
00:21:48,360 --> 00:21:49,592
What does he like to eat?

359
00:21:49,800 --> 00:21:50,800
You...

360
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:52,000
Hong Zhen!

361
00:21:53,479 --> 00:21:54,592
Can you eat properly?

362
00:21:56,719 --> 00:21:57,719
Miss Qi.

363
00:22:14,520 --> 00:22:16,192
Su, Huo.

364
00:22:16,280 --> 00:22:17,352
Everyone is tired from the trip.

365
00:22:17,599 --> 00:22:19,200
Let's go to that tea house for some tea

366
00:22:19,280 --> 00:22:20,280
and rest our feet.

367
00:22:34,599 --> 00:22:35,753
Young Master Huo.

368
00:22:39,560 --> 00:22:40,712
I'm sorry,

369
00:22:40,959 --> 00:22:42,033
Young Master Huo.

370
00:22:42,319 --> 00:22:43,759
My legs are too long

371
00:22:43,839 --> 00:22:45,072
and there's no place to put them.

372
00:22:45,239 --> 00:22:46,832
You should find another place

373
00:22:47,079 --> 00:22:48,079
to sit.

374
00:22:51,280 --> 00:22:52,280
Drink up.

375
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:02,640
I'm sorry.

376
00:23:02,720 --> 00:23:04,159
I don't like sitting with someone

377
00:23:04,239 --> 00:23:05,239
who has no shame.

378
00:23:07,239 --> 00:23:08,513
This is what you get for bullying

379
00:23:08,800 --> 00:23:10,519
- Yuan Bao.   - Xiao Hui,

380
00:23:10,599 --> 00:23:11,599
behave yourself.

381
00:23:29,359 --> 00:23:30,359
Yun Rong, it's so hot.

382
00:23:45,719 --> 00:23:47,119
- It's so hot.   - It's been so long.

383
00:23:47,206 --> 00:23:48,206
When will we arrive?

384
00:23:49,079 --> 00:23:50,279
Please. Just bear with it

385
00:23:50,359 --> 00:23:51,359
We'll be there soon.

386
00:23:51,439 --> 00:23:52,720
If Qi Yuan Bao hadn't saved my life,

387
00:23:52,800 --> 00:23:53,800
I wouldn't have said yes.

388
00:23:55,012 --> 00:23:56,325
Yun Rong is here.

389
00:23:56,779 --> 00:23:57,779
Quick.

390
00:23:59,800 --> 00:24:00,800
Yun Rong, you're here.

391
00:24:00,880 --> 00:24:02,520
What's the matter? We're training.

392
00:24:03,079 --> 00:24:04,960
Yuan Bao, Master asked me to buy some flat bread

393
00:24:05,040 --> 00:24:06,040
for you.

394
00:24:06,880 --> 00:24:08,993
No need. She's not hungry.

395
00:24:18,760 --> 00:24:20,673
Can't you be better than this?

396
00:24:21,359 --> 00:24:23,359
What is that? Can you eat it?

397
00:24:27,479 --> 00:24:28,759
No need. Thank you.

398
00:24:28,839 --> 00:24:29,839
No need.

399
00:24:32,800 --> 00:24:34,680
Just give her flat bread. No need to hold her hands.

400
00:24:36,719 --> 00:24:37,753
Thank you for your gift.

401
00:24:38,040 --> 00:24:39,080
If we're hungry,

402
00:24:39,160 --> 00:24:40,160
we'll eat it.

403
00:24:40,479 --> 00:24:41,832
Please go back first.

404
00:24:45,400 --> 00:24:46,880
Your master is starving.

405
00:24:46,960 --> 00:24:48,352
Give him some flat bread.

406
00:24:50,199 --> 00:24:51,199
He means no good.

407
00:24:58,400 --> 00:24:59,400
Listen.

408
00:24:59,439 --> 00:25:00,560
Don't eat anything

409
00:25:00,640 --> 00:25:01,640
given to you by other men

410
00:25:01,839 --> 00:25:02,839
in the future, do you hear me?

411
00:25:04,520 --> 00:25:06,033
What do you mean by other men?

412
00:25:06,199 --> 00:25:07,513
He's my senior.

413
00:25:09,640 --> 00:25:10,640
Is he

414
00:25:11,560 --> 00:25:12,673
very close to you?

415
00:25:13,920 --> 00:25:14,920
He...

416
00:25:15,519 --> 00:25:17,153
Yes, we're very close.

417
00:25:17,920 --> 00:25:20,952
Since we were little, he's been taking care of me.

418
00:25:21,122 --> 00:25:22,192
Unlike someone I know.

419
00:25:23,627 --> 00:25:24,265
Then don't eat it.

420
00:25:26,117 --> 00:25:27,625
Once you give it to me, it's mine.

421
00:25:27,705 --> 00:25:28,897
How can you go back on your word?

422
00:25:37,453 --> 00:25:38,179
What are you doing?

423
00:25:39,599 --> 00:25:40,673
Too many scallions.

424
00:25:45,160 --> 00:25:46,160
You're so picky.

425
00:25:47,199 --> 00:25:48,199
Girls don't like

426
00:25:48,239 --> 00:25:49,633
food with such a strong flavor.

427
00:25:51,160 --> 00:25:52,160
Yuan Bao does.

428
00:25:56,760 --> 00:25:58,239
We need to hurry or we'll be late.

429
00:26:04,839 --> 00:26:06,712
That was close! I almost lost my finger.

430
00:26:08,199 --> 00:26:09,600
Qi Yuan Bao, you're so clumsy.

431
00:26:09,680 --> 00:26:10,952
You can't even cook.

432
00:26:13,160 --> 00:26:14,760
Whatever. As long as

433
00:26:14,840 --> 00:26:16,112
Chang Yue likes it.

434
00:26:22,560 --> 00:26:24,520
Hideous creature, what are you doing?

435
00:26:25,439 --> 00:26:27,199
What are you doing in my kitchen this early?

436
00:26:28,040 --> 00:26:29,040
I'm making something for...

437
00:26:32,160 --> 00:26:33,160
You're just in time.

438
00:26:33,199 --> 00:26:34,199
When I start cooking,

439
00:26:34,279 --> 00:26:35,279
fan the fire for me.

440
00:26:35,359 --> 00:26:37,312
- I can't handle it myself.   - Do you have a death wish?

441
00:26:37,439 --> 00:26:39,040
Are you used to ordering me around?

442
00:26:40,280 --> 00:26:41,280
Please?

443
00:26:42,119 --> 00:26:43,119
I'm warning you.

444
00:26:43,199 --> 00:26:44,199
You're not allowed

445
00:26:44,239 --> 00:26:45,239
to look at me like that again.

446
00:26:46,920 --> 00:26:48,400
I'm already immune to your eyes.

447
00:26:48,560 --> 00:26:49,880
You won't control me this time.

448
00:26:57,439 --> 00:26:58,832
Grandmother Bi Xi was right.

449
00:26:59,280 --> 00:27:00,753
You're a witch.

450
00:27:03,359 --> 00:27:05,079
Should I put salt in first or chili powder?

451
00:27:05,239 --> 00:27:06,273
You're asking me about cooking?

452
00:27:06,520 --> 00:27:07,633
Do I look like I cook?

453
00:27:07,920 --> 00:27:08,952
Forget I asked.

454
00:27:11,359 --> 00:27:12,359
Then I'll put everything in.

455
00:27:25,640 --> 00:27:27,033
It's not hot enough.

456
00:27:27,670 --> 00:27:30,150
Have you eaten? Can you put in more effort? This is for Chang Yue.

457
00:27:30,175 --> 00:27:31,775
If he gets a stomachache, it's your fault.

458
00:27:31,800 --> 00:27:33,159
You're naggy. I haven't used my powers.

459
00:27:33,184 --> 00:27:33,984
Can't you see that?

460
00:27:34,166 --> 00:27:35,166
Then use them!

461
00:27:42,460 --> 00:27:43,940
Yan Hong Zhen, what did you do?

462
00:27:48,760 --> 00:27:50,033
What did you two do?

463
00:27:50,239 --> 00:27:51,633
How did you set the kitchen on fire?

464
00:27:52,920 --> 00:27:53,920
Did I put in more effort now?

465
00:27:54,199 --> 00:27:56,200
- Yes, you did.   - Louder! Where's your strength?

466
00:27:56,280 --> 00:27:57,513
Yes, you did!

467
00:27:57,640 --> 00:27:59,319
- Where's your strength?   - Stop it.

468
00:28:12,959 --> 00:28:14,399
Your Highness, I have the latest news.

469
00:28:14,479 --> 00:28:15,479
Do you want to know?

470
00:28:16,280 --> 00:28:17,280
I'm not interested.

471
00:28:17,920 --> 00:28:19,080
Yesterday, Qi Yuan Bao

472
00:28:19,160 --> 00:28:21,352
was taken to Miss Yi Xuan's Yilan Palace.

473
00:28:22,040 --> 00:28:24,039
Isn't Miss Yi Xuan too kind-hearted?

474
00:28:24,119 --> 00:28:25,440
She'll bring anyone in there.

475
00:28:25,520 --> 00:28:27,920
And this morning, she and Prince Yan

476
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:29,620
burned down their palace kitchen.

477
00:28:31,293 --> 00:28:32,791
This Qi Yuan Bao is something else.

478
00:28:33,199 --> 00:28:35,793
She came to Beiming a few days ago and she's already close to Prince Yan.

479
00:28:36,004 --> 00:28:37,192
Do you know Prince Yan's character?

480
00:28:37,359 --> 00:28:38,993
He's irritable, arrogant, and crazy.

481
00:28:39,760 --> 00:28:41,592
No one dares to get close to him.

482
00:28:41,959 --> 00:28:42,959
Qi Yuan Bao is good.

483
00:28:43,199 --> 00:28:44,560
She came here

484
00:28:44,640 --> 00:28:45,712
and tamed him.

485
00:28:46,719 --> 00:28:48,112
How unbelievable.

486
00:28:49,760 --> 00:28:50,760
Can you imagine?

487
00:28:51,280 --> 00:28:52,280
Are you done?

488
00:28:52,839 --> 00:28:53,913
If you're done, get out.

489
00:28:54,280 --> 00:28:55,393
Don't bother me while I read.

490
00:28:57,160 --> 00:28:58,560
Okay, do your thing.

491
00:28:58,640 --> 00:28:59,673
Read.

492
00:29:49,640 --> 00:29:50,640
So

493
00:29:51,359 --> 00:29:52,553
this is the room

494
00:29:52,839 --> 00:29:54,633
Chang Yue grew up in.

495
00:30:54,680 --> 00:30:56,400
Your Highness, what is this?

496
00:30:58,719 --> 00:31:00,273
Who cooked this?

497
00:31:00,680 --> 00:31:01,993
It probably isn't edible.

498
00:31:07,040 --> 00:31:08,072
Take it out and throw it away.

499
00:31:08,327 --> 00:31:08,998
Okay.

500
00:31:30,479 --> 00:31:31,479
Chang Yue

501
00:31:31,520 --> 00:31:32,993
must think I messed up the dishes,

502
00:31:33,719 --> 00:31:35,232
so he doesn't want to eat it.

503
00:31:41,246 --> 00:31:42,246
It's okay.

504
00:31:42,719 --> 00:31:43,719
Next time,

505
00:31:44,359 --> 00:31:45,577
I'll cook something better.

506
00:32:00,599 --> 00:32:01,599
Hu Xiao Mei.

507
00:32:02,680 --> 00:32:03,793
Your Highness, what's the matter?

508
00:32:13,680 --> 00:32:14,680
Never mind.

509
00:32:15,000 --> 00:32:16,000
It's okay. You are dismissed.

510
00:32:18,760 --> 00:32:19,760
Oh, right, Your Highness.

511
00:32:19,839 --> 00:32:21,432
The luncheon box was here once again.

512
00:32:21,839 --> 00:32:23,153
But I know you don't like it,

513
00:32:23,319 --> 00:32:24,753
so I fed it to the bunnies.

514
00:32:38,040 --> 00:32:39,560
Only ten days left

515
00:32:39,640 --> 00:32:41,033
before I promised to go back to Father.

516
00:32:42,239 --> 00:32:43,239
Qi Yuan Bao,

517
00:32:43,279 --> 00:32:44,279
you have to work hard.

518
00:33:01,319 --> 00:33:02,319
Stop it.

519
00:33:02,439 --> 00:33:03,732
Stop it. Just stop.

520
00:33:05,239 --> 00:33:06,239
Chang Yue won't even bother

521
00:33:06,319 --> 00:33:07,472
eating what you cook.

522
00:33:08,760 --> 00:33:10,039
He doesn't have to eat it.

523
00:33:10,119 --> 00:33:11,440
But I insist on cooking for him.

524
00:33:11,520 --> 00:33:12,520
What's wrong?

525
00:33:13,280 --> 00:33:14,839
You're ugly and stupid.

526
00:33:15,680 --> 00:33:16,680
Miss Qi.

527
00:33:17,040 --> 00:33:18,040
Are you still busy?

528
00:33:18,839 --> 00:33:20,640
Yi Xuan, what are you doing here?

529
00:33:20,920 --> 00:33:22,352
I am heading to Yueshen Palace.

530
00:33:22,520 --> 00:33:23,520
I came to see

531
00:33:23,560 --> 00:33:25,240
if you want me to deliver the luncheon box.

532
00:33:26,760 --> 00:33:29,273
But I'm not done cooking.

533
00:33:31,079 --> 00:33:32,232
Is there anything

534
00:33:32,400 --> 00:33:33,432
you want me to pass on?

535
00:33:35,259 --> 00:33:36,372
Chang Yue

536
00:33:36,959 --> 00:33:37,987
probably

537
00:33:38,049 --> 00:33:39,859
wouldn't want to hear what I want to say.

538
00:33:47,680 --> 00:33:49,159
Chang Yue quite likes

539
00:33:49,239 --> 00:33:50,239
this pastry recently.

540
00:33:50,280 --> 00:33:51,432
Let's bring some for him.

541
00:33:59,400 --> 00:34:00,400
I'll leave you two be.

542
00:34:00,560 --> 00:34:01,139
See you.

543
00:34:05,880 --> 00:34:06,952
Be careful.

544
00:34:07,319 --> 00:34:08,319
Yes, Yi Xuan.

545
00:34:15,320 --> 00:34:17,472
Yi Xuan is beautiful

546
00:34:17,800 --> 00:34:19,273
and makes delicious food.

547
00:34:20,199 --> 00:34:22,273
No wonder Chang Yue doesn't want to eat what I make.

548
00:34:27,360 --> 00:34:29,359
Actually, don't compare yourself to my sister,

549
00:34:29,439 --> 00:34:30,439
just be yourself.

550
00:34:31,560 --> 00:34:32,593
How come you

551
00:34:33,040 --> 00:34:34,632
know how to comfort someone right now?

552
00:34:35,199 --> 00:34:36,922
I mean, you can't even hold a candle to her.

553
00:34:37,074 --> 00:34:38,322
Don't flatter yourself.

554
00:34:38,493 --> 00:34:39,598
Even dogs won't eat

555
00:34:40,080 --> 00:34:41,442
what you concocted.

556
00:34:43,144 --> 00:34:44,270
Yan Hong Zhen!
