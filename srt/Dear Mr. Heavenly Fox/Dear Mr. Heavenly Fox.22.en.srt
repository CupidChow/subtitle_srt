1
00:01:48,738 --> 00:01:54,004
(Dear Mr. Heavenly Fox)

2
00:01:54,085 --> 00:01:56,992
(Episode 22)

3
00:03:38,160 --> 00:03:39,293
Chang Yue.

4
00:03:40,080 --> 00:03:42,953
What are you doing in my dream?

5
00:03:48,119 --> 00:03:50,802
Indeed, gazing at a beauty under the moonlight.

6
00:03:50,923 --> 00:03:52,922
The more I look at you, the more I fancy you.

7
00:03:53,550 --> 00:03:55,088
They were right.

8
00:03:57,039 --> 00:03:59,082
You came to me this time.

9
00:03:59,240 --> 00:04:00,642
So don't blame me.

10
00:04:02,639 --> 00:04:03,492
Blame you for what?

11
00:04:44,640 --> 00:04:46,122
What a wonderful dream.

12
00:05:07,959 --> 00:05:10,193
(What a cute couple.)

13
00:05:11,200 --> 00:05:12,200
(Unfortunately,)

14
00:05:12,480 --> 00:05:15,402
(you have to be Qi Lian's and Xue Yu Ying's daughter.)

15
00:05:16,440 --> 00:05:17,722
(Qi Yuan Bao,)

16
00:05:17,927 --> 00:05:19,107
(in this lifetime,)

17
00:05:19,239 --> 00:05:21,435
(don't even think about having a single day of peace.)

18
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:43,122
Master, Qi Yuan Bao is now in position.

19
00:05:43,445 --> 00:05:44,682
Good.

20
00:05:45,440 --> 00:05:46,842
This is great.

21
00:05:47,220 --> 00:05:49,442
My reign begins today.

22
00:06:56,608 --> 00:06:58,010
How could this be?

23
00:06:58,200 --> 00:07:00,602
Master, why isn't there any reaction?

24
00:07:00,980 --> 00:07:01,918
Is this a trick?

25
00:07:12,480 --> 00:07:13,522
Qian Qian?

26
00:07:13,720 --> 00:07:15,033
Qian Qian?

27
00:07:17,640 --> 00:07:18,640
Father?

28
00:07:23,720 --> 00:07:24,962
How come it's you?

29
00:07:25,119 --> 00:07:26,402
Where is Qi Yuan Bao?

30
00:07:27,040 --> 00:07:28,122
How come

31
00:07:28,351 --> 00:07:30,114
you're my kidnapper?

32
00:07:30,782 --> 00:07:33,642
You colluded with outsiders to plot against me.

33
00:07:34,133 --> 00:07:35,682
Answer my question.

34
00:07:36,160 --> 00:07:37,642
Where is Qi Yuan Bao?

35
00:07:37,806 --> 00:07:38,806
Father,

36
00:07:39,440 --> 00:07:41,088
you didn't kill those cultivators, did you?

37
00:07:42,160 --> 00:07:42,768
It can't be you.

38
00:07:44,720 --> 00:07:46,272
Answer my question.

39
00:07:46,402 --> 00:07:48,122
Where is Qi Yuan Bao?

40
00:07:57,200 --> 00:07:59,136
Qi Yuan Bao did not come to Suiyue Mountain.

41
00:07:59,679 --> 00:08:00,863
Give up already.

42
00:08:04,962 --> 00:08:07,082
If that's the case,

43
00:08:10,713 --> 00:08:12,886
why should I keep you alive?

44
00:08:28,525 --> 00:08:29,962
Father.

45
00:08:31,341 --> 00:08:32,922
I'm your daughter.

46
00:08:33,119 --> 00:08:36,002
You're the one who betrayed me first.

47
00:08:36,249 --> 00:08:37,562
Father.

48
00:08:51,479 --> 00:08:52,842
Qian Qian!

49
00:08:55,599 --> 00:08:56,599
Father.

50
00:09:01,840 --> 00:09:04,282
So you weren't poisoned after all.

51
00:09:04,640 --> 00:09:07,642
You thought you could fool us with your petty tricks?

52
00:09:07,840 --> 00:09:09,042
Su Qing Mu,

53
00:09:09,385 --> 00:09:10,642
back at Suiyue Mountain,

54
00:09:10,838 --> 00:09:13,402
was it you who killed the fellow cultivators?

55
00:09:14,400 --> 00:09:15,760
So what if it was me?

56
00:09:15,918 --> 00:09:18,162
Why did you have to kill them all?

57
00:09:18,400 --> 00:09:20,599
They had it coming.

58
00:09:20,734 --> 00:09:21,734
You...

59
00:09:21,840 --> 00:09:23,513
Just because we discovered the mausoleum,

60
00:09:23,760 --> 00:09:25,840
you had to kill your own kind?

61
00:09:25,990 --> 00:09:28,110
You bring shame to cultivators and mankind.

62
00:09:30,520 --> 00:09:32,953
Huo Chen, you framed Chang Yue

63
00:09:33,359 --> 00:09:34,672
for your own benefit.

64
00:09:34,833 --> 00:09:37,242
What right do you have to accuse me of wrongdoing?

65
00:09:37,960 --> 00:09:39,953
Ask yourselves.

66
00:09:40,369 --> 00:09:41,682
Have you never

67
00:09:41,864 --> 00:09:44,482
coveted the power of the Corpse Puppet King?

68
00:09:44,719 --> 00:09:45,520
Su Qing Mu,

69
00:09:46,039 --> 00:09:47,020
even now,

70
00:09:47,588 --> 00:09:48,802
you show no remorse.

71
00:09:49,273 --> 00:09:50,062
I...

72
00:09:50,939 --> 00:09:52,042
Shu Ya!

73
00:09:54,864 --> 00:09:55,676
What's going on?

74
00:09:59,440 --> 00:10:00,482
What's happening?

75
00:10:00,579 --> 00:10:01,272
Uncle Qi.

76
00:10:09,760 --> 00:10:10,760
Qi Lian,

77
00:10:12,239 --> 00:10:15,242
how do you like the Power Nullifying Powder?

78
00:10:17,446 --> 00:10:19,602
I advise you not to act rashly.

79
00:10:19,840 --> 00:10:21,362
As you all know,

80
00:10:21,640 --> 00:10:23,722
forcibly using your spiritual power

81
00:10:23,880 --> 00:10:26,032
will only make you die faster.

82
00:10:26,544 --> 00:10:28,265
Sect Leader Qi, how could this happen?

83
00:10:28,455 --> 00:10:30,602
I clearly switched out the drug in the food.

84
00:10:35,117 --> 00:10:37,322
It must have been those butterflies earlier.

85
00:10:46,239 --> 00:10:49,270
So you saw through our plan long ago.

86
00:10:50,653 --> 00:10:52,962
Qi Yuan Bao may be cunning,

87
00:10:53,103 --> 00:10:55,520
but I know my daughters better.

88
00:10:56,039 --> 00:10:57,562
You think you can fool me?

89
00:10:57,871 --> 00:10:59,242
Dream on.

90
00:11:00,799 --> 00:11:01,799
Master,

91
00:11:02,039 --> 00:11:03,682
you're holding them as hostage.

92
00:11:03,880 --> 00:11:05,242
What a brilliant strategy.

93
00:11:06,159 --> 00:11:07,402
Su Qing Mu,

94
00:11:07,559 --> 00:11:08,882
you're despicable.

95
00:11:09,119 --> 00:11:10,583
What do you really want?

96
00:11:10,760 --> 00:11:13,002
I want Qi Yuan Bao.

97
00:11:13,184 --> 00:11:14,322
No way!

98
00:11:16,864 --> 00:11:19,202
With all of you in my hands,

99
00:11:19,520 --> 00:11:21,282
she will surely appear.

100
00:11:22,320 --> 00:11:22,818
You there.

101
00:11:23,440 --> 00:11:24,878
Tell Qi Yuan Bao

102
00:11:25,280 --> 00:11:27,993
that I'm waiting for her here.

103
00:11:28,400 --> 00:11:29,016
Ptooey!

104
00:11:29,559 --> 00:11:30,676
Why should I help you?

105
00:11:35,312 --> 00:11:37,216
You have seven days.

106
00:11:37,718 --> 00:11:40,190
If Qi Yuan Bao doesn't appear in seven days,

107
00:11:40,359 --> 00:11:41,393
I'll start killing people.

108
00:11:41,579 --> 00:11:42,739
Make your decision now.

109
00:11:42,790 --> 00:11:43,183
I...

110
00:11:44,957 --> 00:11:46,280
Don't be impulsive.

111
00:11:49,599 --> 00:11:50,272
Go quickly.

112
00:11:59,692 --> 00:12:01,344
It's okay. Wait for me to come back.

113
00:12:33,668 --> 00:12:34,872
Uncle Qi,

114
00:12:35,320 --> 00:12:36,962
I'll find Yuan Bao as soon as possible

115
00:12:37,101 --> 00:12:38,522
and save all of you.

116
00:12:42,679 --> 00:12:44,340
A few days ago, Hong Zhen told me

117
00:12:44,421 --> 00:12:46,105
he took Miss Qi out for a tour.

118
00:12:46,338 --> 00:12:48,452
He saw that the flowers on Yangjie Mountain were in bloom.

119
00:12:49,119 --> 00:12:51,215
Do you have time in the next few days

120
00:12:51,471 --> 00:12:53,602
for a walk?

121
00:12:54,320 --> 00:12:58,145
Admire the beautiful scenery may help your recovery process.

122
00:12:59,000 --> 00:12:59,678
I'm not fond of that.

123
00:13:01,239 --> 00:13:03,192
(I hung out with Yan Hong Zhen.)

124
00:13:03,320 --> 00:13:06,712
(I saw many cute kids of your clan.)

125
00:13:07,159 --> 00:13:08,722
(They are as cute as you.)

126
00:13:09,679 --> 00:13:12,273
(But at that time, I was thinking)

127
00:13:13,239 --> 00:13:14,682
(when)

128
00:13:15,479 --> 00:13:18,002
(you would show me the place.)

129
00:13:22,433 --> 00:13:25,002
You don't like going out?

130
00:13:25,640 --> 00:13:26,993
Sure, I'm free.

131
00:13:31,520 --> 00:13:33,082
Then I'll have them get ready.

132
00:13:43,359 --> 00:13:44,552
Stupid Chang Yue.

133
00:13:44,760 --> 00:13:46,360
He went out with Yi Xuan

134
00:13:46,440 --> 00:13:47,922
but he didn't take me with him.

135
00:13:48,030 --> 00:13:50,513
Back at Qishan Sect, I took him out plenty of times.

136
00:13:54,837 --> 00:13:56,199
What are you doing, ugly face?

137
00:13:58,080 --> 00:13:59,080
Daydreaming.

138
00:13:59,479 --> 00:14:01,293
I'm in a good mood. Where do you want to go?

139
00:14:01,374 --> 00:14:02,402
I'll take you anywhere.

140
00:14:05,239 --> 00:14:06,239
Yangjie Mountain.

141
00:14:06,362 --> 00:14:07,962
I want to go there. Do you know where it is?

142
00:14:08,059 --> 00:14:10,519
There's no place in all of Beiming that I don't know about.

143
00:14:10,637 --> 00:14:11,637
Really?

144
00:14:12,679 --> 00:14:14,880
I think you're just jealous that Chang Yue is hanging out

145
00:14:14,960 --> 00:14:16,440
with Yi Xuan, so you want to be there too.

146
00:14:16,520 --> 00:14:20,042
No! I'm just really curious about what it looks like there.

147
00:14:20,239 --> 00:14:21,440
If you know where it is,

148
00:14:21,520 --> 00:14:23,240
why don't you take me there? Please?

149
00:14:23,320 --> 00:14:24,320
You want to go there?

150
00:14:24,401 --> 00:14:25,522
No, thank you.

151
00:14:39,119 --> 00:14:40,119
Are you trying to kill me?

152
00:14:40,559 --> 00:14:41,338
How dare you hit me?

153
00:14:41,545 --> 00:14:42,072
I'm sorry.

154
00:14:48,479 --> 00:14:49,839
- Let's go.   - Okay.

155
00:14:49,919 --> 00:14:50,919
Wait.

156
00:14:52,080 --> 00:14:53,080
What's the matter?

157
00:14:54,400 --> 00:14:56,352
- Nothing.   - Then what are you waiting for?

158
00:14:57,039 --> 00:14:58,039
Just wait.

159
00:15:00,520 --> 00:15:02,032
I wonder what His Highness is waiting for.

160
00:15:02,359 --> 00:15:03,359
This is weird.

161
00:15:03,960 --> 00:15:05,360
Don't you have a way to follow them?

162
00:15:05,440 --> 00:15:06,599
They're leaving. What do we do?

163
00:15:06,679 --> 00:15:07,876
Don't rush me. Stand still.

164
00:15:08,327 --> 00:15:09,573
- What for?   - Look at me.

165
00:15:14,640 --> 00:15:16,232
What is this?

166
00:15:16,599 --> 00:15:17,599
We'll talk inside.

167
00:15:33,159 --> 00:15:35,680
Are you sure those two can't see us?

168
00:15:35,760 --> 00:15:36,760
Speak louder.

169
00:15:36,919 --> 00:15:37,919
Where's your strength?

170
00:15:38,159 --> 00:15:39,633
Hush!

171
00:15:40,400 --> 00:15:41,479
Don't worry.

172
00:15:41,559 --> 00:15:43,519
This is a stealthy and soundproof barrier set up by me.

173
00:15:43,599 --> 00:15:45,440
They can't hear us or see us.

174
00:15:45,533 --> 00:15:47,605
Really? Are you pulling my leg?

175
00:15:47,719 --> 00:15:48,292
Try it.

176
00:15:59,880 --> 00:16:00,880
Chang Yue.

177
00:16:03,479 --> 00:16:04,479
Chang Yue.

178
00:16:11,400 --> 00:16:12,400
You scared me.

179
00:16:15,440 --> 00:16:16,440
Chang Yue.

180
00:16:18,679 --> 00:16:19,679
It's real.

181
00:16:19,760 --> 00:16:21,440
So you can be useful for once.

182
00:16:21,520 --> 00:16:22,912
Did you think that I'm just useless

183
00:16:23,159 --> 00:16:24,880
like you humans? This is true power.

184
00:16:33,440 --> 00:16:34,440
Boring.

185
00:16:42,440 --> 00:16:44,280
You really are stupid. Can't you be more careful?

186
00:16:51,320 --> 00:16:52,479
- All right.   - Are you okay?

187
00:16:52,559 --> 00:16:54,440
- I'm fine.   - I'm all right.

188
00:17:10,079 --> 00:17:12,432
(Since Chang Yue can't detect me,)

189
00:17:13,160 --> 00:17:14,952
(then can I...)

190
00:17:29,719 --> 00:17:30,959
- What the heck?   - What the heck?

191
00:17:31,560 --> 00:17:33,639
You're really shameless. What were you doing?

192
00:17:33,719 --> 00:17:34,719
Let me be. Let go of me!

193
00:17:34,760 --> 00:17:36,712
What do you mean let you be? This is a barrier, okay?

194
00:17:37,315 --> 00:17:39,192
Let go of me! Stop!

195
00:17:39,479 --> 00:17:40,480
Let go of me!

196
00:17:40,692 --> 00:17:41,560
You...

197
00:17:41,800 --> 00:17:43,359
- Stop moving.   - Let go!

198
00:17:45,719 --> 00:17:46,719
Can you even steer properly?

199
00:17:49,338 --> 00:17:49,844
You...

200
00:17:51,599 --> 00:17:52,633
Why are you guys here?

201
00:17:54,786 --> 00:17:55,786
I...

202
00:17:59,079 --> 00:18:01,112
Prince Yan, look!

203
00:18:01,319 --> 00:18:03,513
The flowers here are so pretty!

204
00:18:04,543 --> 00:18:05,616
Hi, ugly freak.

205
00:18:05,800 --> 00:18:06,913
Can you speak properly?

206
00:18:08,359 --> 00:18:09,600
The flowers here are so beautiful.

207
00:18:09,680 --> 00:18:11,393
Can you pick one for me?

208
00:18:11,680 --> 00:18:12,753
Why should I pick one for you?

209
00:18:29,119 --> 00:18:30,119
Where is the flower?

210
00:18:47,439 --> 00:18:48,439
Qi Yuan Bao.

211
00:18:49,239 --> 00:18:50,712
Can't you tell you're not needed here?

212
00:18:50,920 --> 00:18:51,920
I...

213
00:19:24,239 --> 00:19:25,239
Are you okay?

214
00:19:33,839 --> 00:19:35,039
- What?   - Let's go.

215
00:19:35,119 --> 00:19:36,119
I'll carry you on my back.

216
00:19:37,453 --> 00:19:38,765
Prince Yan, you...

217
00:19:50,840 --> 00:19:52,279
It's over. Everything is over.

218
00:19:52,359 --> 00:19:53,359
They're together again.

219
00:19:54,599 --> 00:19:56,359
- Loosen your grip a little.   - No.

220
00:19:56,439 --> 00:19:58,153
If I let go, what if you run away?

221
00:19:59,312 --> 00:20:00,132
I won't run.

222
00:20:01,612 --> 00:20:02,419
For real?

223
00:20:07,280 --> 00:20:09,633
Chang Yue, you're carrying me now,

224
00:20:09,757 --> 00:20:11,885
does that mean you've forgiven me?

225
00:20:12,479 --> 00:20:13,712
I can put you down right now.

226
00:20:13,880 --> 00:20:15,362
Don't. My feet hurt.

227
00:20:15,705 --> 00:20:18,322
You don't like hearing it. I just won't say it then.

228
00:20:19,131 --> 00:20:20,775
Then, Chang Yue,

229
00:20:21,204 --> 00:20:23,553
were you admiring the moon the night before last night?

230
00:20:24,319 --> 00:20:25,319
Yes, I was.

231
00:20:25,439 --> 00:20:26,913
So you really were admiring the moon.

232
00:20:27,976 --> 00:20:29,673
There's a perfect spot in my room for moon-gazing.

233
00:20:30,400 --> 00:20:31,472
I couldn't let the pristine moon

234
00:20:31,800 --> 00:20:32,800
go to waste that day.

235
00:20:34,319 --> 00:20:36,393
You were admiring the moon in your room?

236
00:20:36,959 --> 00:20:37,959
Where else would I be?

237
00:20:39,880 --> 00:20:41,072
So it was just a dream.

238
00:20:42,319 --> 00:20:43,592
Then let me ask you something else.

239
00:20:45,021 --> 00:20:46,549
Why do you have so many questions?

240
00:20:46,630 --> 00:20:47,922
It's the last one.

241
00:20:49,199 --> 00:20:52,942
How did Mohun return to you?

242
00:20:56,800 --> 00:20:57,746
It was abandoned,

243
00:20:59,280 --> 00:21:00,972
so it returned to its previous owner.

244
00:21:04,719 --> 00:21:07,873
Actually, I didn't abandon it.

245
00:21:12,325 --> 00:21:13,325
Chang Yue,

246
00:21:13,559 --> 00:21:14,712
I'm saying that what if,

247
00:21:15,439 --> 00:21:17,033
in the future,

248
00:21:17,199 --> 00:21:18,432
you decide to forgive me.

249
00:21:19,479 --> 00:21:21,673
Can I have Mohun back?

250
00:21:25,560 --> 00:21:28,192
Once you abandon certain things,

251
00:21:29,160 --> 00:21:30,160
you can't just

252
00:21:30,839 --> 00:21:32,072
get them back when you want to.

253
00:21:32,640 --> 00:21:33,640
I don't care.

254
00:21:33,959 --> 00:21:35,952
I am shameless that way.

255
00:21:36,479 --> 00:21:37,479
I won't give up.

256
00:21:37,800 --> 00:21:38,800
Chang Yue,

257
00:21:38,880 --> 00:21:40,472
you better keep a close eye on Mohun.

258
00:21:40,719 --> 00:21:42,352
One day, when you're not paying attention,

259
00:21:42,719 --> 00:21:43,793
I might just take it.

260
00:21:45,040 --> 00:21:46,312
(You still act so)

261
00:21:47,040 --> 00:21:48,192
(willfully.)

262
00:21:50,439 --> 00:21:51,439
Chang Yue,

263
00:21:52,160 --> 00:21:54,639
I won't do anything

264
00:21:54,719 --> 00:21:56,312
that makes you unhappy in the future.

265
00:22:15,319 --> 00:22:17,033
Where did my jade pendant go?

266
00:22:17,239 --> 00:22:18,959
I didn't go anywhere these past few days.

267
00:22:19,800 --> 00:22:21,952
Could it be at Chang Yue's place?

268
00:22:44,959 --> 00:22:46,112
Miss Qi, you're here again.

269
00:22:49,599 --> 00:22:50,599
Chang Yue,

270
00:22:50,680 --> 00:22:52,673
can you ask the spirit butterfly again?

271
00:22:53,079 --> 00:22:54,784
I think I left my jade pendant

272
00:22:54,864 --> 00:22:55,864
here.

273
00:23:01,800 --> 00:23:02,800
Okay.

274
00:23:23,680 --> 00:23:25,673
Chang Yue, my jade pendant is here.

275
00:23:34,040 --> 00:23:35,312
Chang Yue, what are you doing?

276
00:23:36,959 --> 00:23:38,072
The jade pendant isn't here.

277
00:23:38,719 --> 00:23:41,112
But the spirit butterfly was flickering here.

278
00:23:42,280 --> 00:23:43,592
It fell sick lately,

279
00:23:43,760 --> 00:23:44,760
so it's not accurate.

280
00:23:48,880 --> 00:23:51,432
Spirit butterflies can get sick?

281
00:23:58,346 --> 00:23:59,203
Okay then.

282
00:23:59,800 --> 00:24:01,273
Never mind. I won't look for it anymore.

283
00:24:12,978 --> 00:24:13,828
This is...

284
00:24:20,560 --> 00:24:21,214
This is...

285
00:24:22,319 --> 00:24:24,033
This robe is...

286
00:24:26,959 --> 00:24:28,721
Miss Yuan Bao, you also think this robe

287
00:24:28,801 --> 00:24:30,192
is tattered, don't you?

288
00:24:30,575 --> 00:24:31,975
Compared to that new robe

289
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:33,312
Miss Yi Xuan brought last time,

290
00:24:33,680 --> 00:24:35,553
it's like day and night.

291
00:24:35,719 --> 00:24:37,513
But His Highness said he preferred the inferior one.

292
00:24:37,760 --> 00:24:38,760
You talk too much.

293
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:47,952
So you like the inferior version.

294
00:24:51,639 --> 00:24:52,349
Now that I see it,

295
00:24:52,920 --> 00:24:54,072
this robe is indeed tattered.

296
00:24:54,880 --> 00:24:55,349
Hu Xiao Mei,

297
00:24:56,079 --> 00:24:57,079
take it out and throw it away.

298
00:24:57,846 --> 00:24:59,213
No, don't throw it away.

299
00:25:19,359 --> 00:25:20,359
Finally, I'm almost there.

300
00:25:29,040 --> 00:25:30,273
Why is there a barrier here?

301
00:25:31,359 --> 00:25:32,553
Why is there a barrier here?

302
00:25:34,520 --> 00:25:35,961
Yuan Bao!

303
00:25:36,041 --> 00:25:37,832
Can you hear me? Yuan Bao!

304
00:25:37,959 --> 00:25:38,959
Yuan Bao!

305
00:25:44,873 --> 00:25:45,873
How strange.

306
00:25:46,560 --> 00:25:48,072
It's not at Yangjie Mountain.

307
00:25:48,239 --> 00:25:49,712
It's not at Chang Yue's place either.

308
00:25:50,215 --> 00:25:51,535
I've searched Yilan Palace

309
00:25:51,560 --> 00:25:53,072
and everywhere but it's not there either.

310
00:25:53,520 --> 00:25:54,553
Could this jade pendant

311
00:25:54,959 --> 00:25:56,753
have vanished into thin air?

312
00:25:57,119 --> 00:25:58,119
Yuan Bao!

313
00:26:05,640 --> 00:26:06,640
Don't I have the flute?

314
00:26:06,760 --> 00:26:07,913
How could I forget about this?

315
00:26:17,520 --> 00:26:18,520
This flute sound...

316
00:26:19,239 --> 00:26:20,239
Xue Han Yu!

317
00:26:21,640 --> 00:26:22,418
Xue Han Yu!

318
00:26:22,800 --> 00:26:24,600
- Xue Han Yu!   - Yuan Bao, you finally appear.

319
00:26:24,625 --> 00:26:25,680
Xue Han Yu.

320
00:26:27,920 --> 00:26:29,399
How did you get hurt? I wasn't with you.

321
00:26:29,479 --> 00:26:31,119
How did you get yourself into this sorry state?

322
00:26:31,199 --> 00:26:32,232
Forget about this.

323
00:26:32,319 --> 00:26:33,319
Your father is in trouble.

324
00:26:33,880 --> 00:26:34,880
What?

325
00:26:59,880 --> 00:27:00,880
Sect Leader Qi,

326
00:27:01,239 --> 00:27:03,273
the Evil-cleansing Formation only works on demons.

327
00:27:04,479 --> 00:27:05,999
Are you sure it will work

328
00:27:06,079 --> 00:27:07,393
on Su Qing Mu?

329
00:27:08,400 --> 00:27:10,273
Just wait and see.

330
00:27:32,520 --> 00:27:33,520
Who would have thought

331
00:27:33,560 --> 00:27:35,592
that Su Qing Mu would go this far?

332
00:27:36,239 --> 00:27:37,239
How are you feeling?

333
00:27:37,319 --> 00:27:38,319
Can you walk?

334
00:27:38,400 --> 00:27:39,400
Let me try.

335
00:27:46,499 --> 00:27:47,856
I'm fine now. I can now

336
00:27:47,881 --> 00:27:48,960
kick Su Qing Mu

337
00:27:49,158 --> 00:27:50,066
a hundred times.

338
00:27:50,359 --> 00:27:52,393
This is not the time to be joking around.

339
00:27:53,719 --> 00:27:55,239
Oh, right. Before I left,

340
00:27:55,520 --> 00:27:56,633
your father gave me this.

341
00:27:56,920 --> 00:27:57,552
What's this?

342
00:28:00,880 --> 00:28:01,993
I suppose Su Qing Mu

343
00:28:02,280 --> 00:28:03,352
is some kind of demonic entity.

344
00:28:03,640 --> 00:28:05,080
Otherwise, your father wouldn't have

345
00:28:05,105 --> 00:28:05,812
given this to us.

346
00:28:07,719 --> 00:28:09,063
You're finally smart for once.

347
00:28:09,880 --> 00:28:10,632
You sure you can walk?

348
00:28:10,959 --> 00:28:12,760
- Yes.   - Then let's go now.

349
00:28:13,920 --> 00:28:14,479
Wait.

350
00:28:15,165 --> 00:28:15,676
What's wrong?

351
00:28:18,239 --> 00:28:19,522
Before we go,

352
00:28:20,040 --> 00:28:21,762
there's something really important

353
00:28:21,982 --> 00:28:23,402
I need to return to Chang Yue.
