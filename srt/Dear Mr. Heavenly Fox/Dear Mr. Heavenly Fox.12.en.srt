1
00:01:48,892 --> 00:01:54,002
(Dear Mr. Heavenly Fox)

2
00:01:54,083 --> 00:01:56,913
(Episode 12)

3
00:01:56,994 --> 00:01:59,682
(Beixuan Inn)

4
00:02:03,559 --> 00:02:04,279
This is the place.

5
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:05,552
Let's go.

6
00:02:29,679 --> 00:02:30,679
Are we there yet?

7
00:02:30,759 --> 00:02:32,539
We're here. Come. This way, please.

8
00:02:33,279 --> 00:02:35,032
Mr. Chang Yue is staying in this room.

9
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:38,000
- Come.   - Mr. Chang Yue.

10
00:02:38,039 --> 00:02:39,039
Good.

11
00:02:41,320 --> 00:02:42,320
Mr. Chang Yue, are you there?

12
00:02:42,919 --> 00:02:43,959
- Did he   - Mr. Chang Yue.

13
00:02:44,039 --> 00:02:45,039
leave again?

14
00:02:45,520 --> 00:02:46,520
I don't care.

15
00:02:46,947 --> 00:02:48,330
- Calm down.   - Chang Yue.

16
00:02:48,411 --> 00:02:49,813
Young Lady Qi.

17
00:02:52,199 --> 00:02:54,039
It's okay. Come.

18
00:02:55,679 --> 00:02:56,912
Chang Yue, you...

19
00:03:00,199 --> 00:03:01,199
Young Lady Qi.

20
00:03:01,960 --> 00:03:03,000
Has no one ever told you

21
00:03:03,080 --> 00:03:05,313
to knock before entering?

22
00:03:05,600 --> 00:03:07,552
Or perhaps people like you who treat everything

23
00:03:07,880 --> 00:03:09,433
like a game don't care about courtesy.

24
00:03:13,800 --> 00:03:15,752
Mr. Chang Yue, you're finally back!

25
00:03:16,039 --> 00:03:17,319
You have no idea. Yuan Bao

26
00:03:17,399 --> 00:03:19,360
- has missed you so much.   - Miss who?

27
00:03:19,720 --> 00:03:20,832
When did I ever miss him?

28
00:03:23,279 --> 00:03:24,679
I just hate it when people

29
00:03:24,759 --> 00:03:25,793
leave without saying goodbye.

30
00:03:26,440 --> 00:03:28,632
I mean, if a pet runs away,

31
00:03:29,080 --> 00:03:30,272
I'll only miss it for a few days.

32
00:03:39,080 --> 00:03:40,672
Xue Han Yu, what are you standing there for?

33
00:03:40,919 --> 00:03:42,873
Can't you tell he doesn't welcome us at all?

34
00:03:43,520 --> 00:03:44,118
Let's go.

35
00:03:45,720 --> 00:03:46,720
(So I)

36
00:03:47,039 --> 00:03:48,392
(am just only a pet)

37
00:03:48,800 --> 00:03:50,160
(in your heart.)

38
00:03:50,240 --> 00:03:51,353
What the heck?

39
00:03:51,600 --> 00:03:53,760
He left without saying goodbye. Why is he so mad?

40
00:03:53,840 --> 00:03:56,039
Didn't you guys just meet? Why are you bickering again?

41
00:03:56,174 --> 00:03:57,855
Why don't you ask him? Who knows what you men

42
00:03:57,880 --> 00:04:00,073
are thinking about? It's hard to read your mind.

43
00:04:00,600 --> 00:04:02,153
Mr. Chang Yue is gentle.

44
00:04:02,559 --> 00:04:04,153
He's not someone who would get angry easily.

45
00:04:05,119 --> 00:04:06,399
Did you do something outrageous again

46
00:04:06,479 --> 00:04:08,199
that crossed him?

47
00:04:09,279 --> 00:04:10,319
I didn't knock

48
00:04:10,399 --> 00:04:11,399
and...

49
00:04:16,079 --> 00:04:17,800
Could it be because of

50
00:04:17,880 --> 00:04:19,193
that kiss yesterday?

51
00:04:20,640 --> 00:04:22,193
Is he that uptight

52
00:04:22,480 --> 00:04:23,713
and chaste?

53
00:04:25,359 --> 00:04:26,633
But then again,

54
00:04:27,920 --> 00:04:30,392
didn't he kiss me back?

55
00:04:31,839 --> 00:04:33,840
Kiss what? Who kissed whom?

56
00:04:33,920 --> 00:04:35,072
A handsome man stood before me.

57
00:04:35,320 --> 00:04:36,433
I'm sure he can excuse

58
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:38,000
my rash action.

59
00:04:38,079 --> 00:04:39,079
You there,

60
00:04:39,160 --> 00:04:41,072
take this to Mr. Chang Yue.

61
00:04:41,559 --> 00:04:43,640
He booked a room here for a whole month.

62
00:04:43,720 --> 00:04:44,993
He's our VIP customer.

63
00:04:45,440 --> 00:04:47,279
- Treat him well.   - Okay.

64
00:04:47,359 --> 00:04:48,480
- Be thorough.   - Okay.

65
00:04:48,560 --> 00:04:49,593
(A month?)

66
00:04:50,079 --> 00:04:52,313
Did you hear that? Mr. Chang Yue is staying here for a month.

67
00:04:52,399 --> 00:04:54,399
I don't care how long he stays here.

68
00:04:54,720 --> 00:04:55,720
Let's eat.

69
00:05:01,119 --> 00:05:02,753
I'm full. Let's go home.

70
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:04,000
Let's go home.

71
00:05:29,440 --> 00:05:30,640
- Yuan Bao.   - Shu Ya,

72
00:05:30,720 --> 00:05:32,559
what are you doing here? Are you looking for me?

73
00:05:33,480 --> 00:05:35,193
I prepared some of your favorite dishes.

74
00:05:35,480 --> 00:05:36,753
Want to have a meal together?

75
00:05:37,375 --> 00:05:38,654
But I just ate a lot

76
00:05:38,679 --> 00:05:40,352
with Xue Han Yu down the mountain.

77
00:05:40,480 --> 00:05:41,840
I'm full now.

78
00:05:41,920 --> 00:05:43,352
I can't eat anymore.

79
00:05:44,939 --> 00:05:45,471
Okay.

80
00:05:46,573 --> 00:05:47,966
Let's catch up another day.

81
00:05:48,959 --> 00:05:51,593
Well, Shu Ya, if there's nothing else, I'll head in.

82
00:06:15,279 --> 00:06:17,072
Young Master, the food is ready.

83
00:06:19,920 --> 00:06:20,920
Where is Miss Qi?

84
00:06:23,040 --> 00:06:24,040
Young Master!

85
00:06:24,519 --> 00:06:25,519
Young Master!

86
00:06:34,720 --> 00:06:35,720
It's been so long.

87
00:06:35,760 --> 00:06:37,153
When will this wound

88
00:06:37,279 --> 00:06:38,832
from the Heart-Piercing Arrow finally heal?

89
00:06:40,160 --> 00:06:41,160
It's nothing.

90
00:06:45,040 --> 00:06:46,040
Your Highness,

91
00:06:46,160 --> 00:06:47,199
you should retrieve Mohun

92
00:06:47,279 --> 00:06:48,279
as soon as possible.

93
00:06:48,600 --> 00:06:49,600
With its protection,

94
00:06:49,839 --> 00:06:51,552
your pain will be alleviated.

95
00:06:56,519 --> 00:07:00,193
(I wonder what she's doing right now.)

96
00:07:12,679 --> 00:07:14,272
It's been a while.

97
00:07:15,200 --> 00:07:17,153
He looks thinner.

98
00:07:18,959 --> 00:07:21,033
But his temper has grown quite a bit.

99
00:07:22,079 --> 00:07:23,240
Oh, Chang Yue.

100
00:07:23,320 --> 00:07:25,033
You left without a care back then.

101
00:07:25,279 --> 00:07:26,313
What did you come back?

102
00:07:26,839 --> 00:07:29,633
I'm telling you. I never miss you.

103
00:07:30,440 --> 00:07:31,440
Never.

104
00:07:37,293 --> 00:07:38,293
Little fox!

105
00:07:41,959 --> 00:07:42,559
Don't run.

106
00:07:43,920 --> 00:07:45,120
You heartless fox,

107
00:07:45,200 --> 00:07:47,272
you know to come back? I'll give you an earful.

108
00:07:49,519 --> 00:07:50,633
How did you get hurt?

109
00:07:51,966 --> 00:07:53,925
What did you do?

110
00:07:53,959 --> 00:07:55,672
How did you get yourself injured?

111
00:07:57,720 --> 00:07:58,759
Am I stupid?

112
00:07:58,839 --> 00:08:00,232
You can't even talk.

113
00:08:01,200 --> 00:08:02,473
Good thing I'm here.

114
00:08:10,079 --> 00:08:11,959
Does it hurt? I'll blow on it for you.

115
00:08:15,519 --> 00:08:16,519
Is it better now?

116
00:08:19,200 --> 00:08:20,552
You heartless fox,

117
00:08:21,200 --> 00:08:22,313
I'm telling you,

118
00:08:22,440 --> 00:08:24,552
don't you ever sneak off again.

119
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:27,672
Even if you want to leave, you have to tell me first.

120
00:08:28,160 --> 00:08:29,160
Or you're no different

121
00:08:29,239 --> 00:08:30,552
from that annoying Chang Yue.

122
00:08:30,720 --> 00:08:31,720
You hear me?

123
00:08:34,119 --> 00:08:36,159
Still trying to run? Don't run.

124
00:08:37,919 --> 00:08:38,919
It hurts?

125
00:08:39,520 --> 00:08:41,433
Sorry. I'll be gentle.

126
00:08:42,840 --> 00:08:43,840
Gentle.

127
00:08:47,039 --> 00:08:48,039
Little fox,

128
00:08:48,200 --> 00:08:50,112
you've lost a lot of weight.

129
00:08:56,239 --> 00:08:57,313
You have lost weight.

130
00:08:58,640 --> 00:09:01,352
This is bad. Let me fatten you up.

131
00:10:43,919 --> 00:10:44,919
So many chickens here.

132
00:10:45,039 --> 00:10:46,232
Little fox, tell me,

133
00:10:46,440 --> 00:10:47,552
which one do you fancy?

134
00:10:47,919 --> 00:10:48,919
(I don't eat chicken.)

135
00:10:50,440 --> 00:10:51,479
The plumpest one then.

136
00:10:51,559 --> 00:10:52,559
What do you think?

137
00:10:52,679 --> 00:10:53,753
Wait here obediently.

138
00:11:03,200 --> 00:11:04,200
Don't run.

139
00:11:13,799 --> 00:11:14,799
Stop!

140
00:11:15,239 --> 00:11:16,672
(Can she even do it?)

141
00:11:17,400 --> 00:11:18,400
Don't run!

142
00:11:19,799 --> 00:11:20,799
Don't run!

143
00:11:22,080 --> 00:11:23,080
Don't run, come back!

144
00:11:24,159 --> 00:11:25,159
I...

145
00:11:25,799 --> 00:11:26,799
Come back.

146
00:11:31,679 --> 00:11:32,679
Don't run.

147
00:11:33,520 --> 00:11:34,520
Stop.

148
00:11:37,880 --> 00:11:39,201
As expected, catching chickens

149
00:11:39,281 --> 00:11:40,792
is a fox's second nature.

150
00:11:41,559 --> 00:11:42,559
Let's go.

151
00:11:42,640 --> 00:11:43,672
Let's make some soup!

152
00:11:44,400 --> 00:11:45,195
Let's go.

153
00:11:48,253 --> 00:11:49,253
I'm exhausted.

154
00:11:57,799 --> 00:11:59,152
Posuo Leaf belongs to the fox clan,

155
00:11:59,799 --> 00:12:01,000
and it grows in Wanlu Abyss.

156
00:12:01,080 --> 00:12:02,552
Ordinary people can't get it at all.

157
00:12:03,559 --> 00:12:05,552
Even if they do get it, they might die for it.

158
00:12:07,640 --> 00:12:09,552
And this fox is covered in injuries.

159
00:12:13,400 --> 00:12:14,552
Could it be that it's Chang Yue?

160
00:12:27,440 --> 00:12:28,672
Careful.

161
00:12:31,479 --> 00:12:32,753
Drink slowly.

162
00:12:35,679 --> 00:12:36,679
Drink more.

163
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:38,193
You look so thin.

164
00:12:38,640 --> 00:12:39,792
If you like it,

165
00:12:39,919 --> 00:12:41,492
I'll make more for you next time, okay?

166
00:13:05,760 --> 00:13:06,760
Yuan Bao,

167
00:13:07,799 --> 00:13:09,273
I've only been gone a few days,

168
00:13:10,080 --> 00:13:12,000
and you're already in love with a fox demon?

169
00:13:13,799 --> 00:13:15,672
Is the bond between us

170
00:13:17,080 --> 00:13:19,073
worth nothing at all?

171
00:13:28,840 --> 00:13:30,792
Did that fox demon bewitch you?

172
00:14:31,400 --> 00:14:33,032
Master, was your journey smooth?

173
00:14:34,200 --> 00:14:36,592
Shen wrote that Qi Yuan Bao had recovered.

174
00:14:41,039 --> 00:14:42,472
Just as Meng Shu said.

175
00:14:42,840 --> 00:14:44,880
Let's pack up now and head to Qishan Sect.

176
00:14:44,960 --> 00:14:45,565
Noted.

177
00:14:46,040 --> 00:14:47,393
The show's about to begin.

178
00:14:47,552 --> 00:14:48,552
Departing now

179
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:50,393
gives us the perfect timing.

180
00:14:55,159 --> 00:14:57,273
Oh, Qi Yuan Bao,

181
00:14:57,840 --> 00:14:59,279
what excuse

182
00:14:59,359 --> 00:15:00,399
should you find

183
00:15:00,479 --> 00:15:02,313
to knock on his door?

184
00:15:02,799 --> 00:15:05,313
What if he gives you that poker face again and kicks you out?

185
00:15:08,239 --> 00:15:09,239
Forget it.

186
00:15:09,280 --> 00:15:10,320
I am the Young Lady Qi.

187
00:15:10,400 --> 00:15:11,680
I am generous.

188
00:15:11,760 --> 00:15:13,000
I won't be so fussy.

189
00:15:13,080 --> 00:15:14,080
I'll forgive him.

190
00:15:14,479 --> 00:15:15,479
Besides,

191
00:15:15,960 --> 00:15:17,360
he's such a well-mannered man.

192
00:15:17,440 --> 00:15:18,440
It's reasonable

193
00:15:18,880 --> 00:15:21,513
for him to react the way he did

194
00:15:21,840 --> 00:15:23,112
when he was molested.

195
00:15:24,972 --> 00:15:25,537
Yuan Bao.

196
00:15:29,080 --> 00:15:30,672
You're leaving to hang out with Mr. Chang Yue?

197
00:15:31,239 --> 00:15:32,239
No, I'm not.

198
00:15:32,719 --> 00:15:33,920
I just remembered

199
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:36,160
that I left something at the inn that day.

200
00:15:36,240 --> 00:15:37,240
So I'm going to get it back.

201
00:15:37,280 --> 00:15:38,280
Wait.

202
00:15:42,479 --> 00:15:44,280
The thing you left behind wouldn't happen to be this?

203
00:15:48,653 --> 00:15:49,653
Yuan Bao.

204
00:15:55,320 --> 00:15:56,320
Isn't this Yuan Bao's?

205
00:15:57,039 --> 00:15:58,039
So?

206
00:15:58,239 --> 00:15:59,239
Good thing I was here, huh?

207
00:15:59,520 --> 00:16:01,559
If it weren't for me, you'd have dropped something again.

208
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:03,000
Here. Take it.

209
00:16:07,400 --> 00:16:08,400
No need to thank me.

210
00:16:08,479 --> 00:16:10,232
Don't thank me. I know I'm awesome.

211
00:16:11,280 --> 00:16:12,280
Thank you?

212
00:16:12,479 --> 00:16:13,479
I'll thank your stupid brain.

213
00:16:13,559 --> 00:16:14,560
You good for nothing

214
00:16:14,640 --> 00:16:15,839
idiot!

215
00:16:15,919 --> 00:16:17,633
- Are you crazy?   - Yuan Bao!

216
00:16:17,799 --> 00:16:18,833
I have good news for you.

217
00:16:20,239 --> 00:16:21,239
What good news?

218
00:16:21,400 --> 00:16:23,200
Master is holding a thank-you banquet for you.

219
00:16:23,520 --> 00:16:24,873
A thank-you banquet?

220
00:16:25,799 --> 00:16:28,232
It's to thank Huo Shu Ya for saving your life.

221
00:16:28,559 --> 00:16:30,833
And we've invited many cultivators from various sects.

222
00:16:33,799 --> 00:16:35,680
Oh, right! Thanks for the reminder.

223
00:16:35,760 --> 00:16:37,460
I haven't bought a gift for Shu Ya yet.

224
00:16:38,119 --> 00:16:39,419
- I'm leaving now.   - What?

225
00:16:41,080 --> 00:16:42,112
Yuan Bao, wait for me!

226
00:16:42,799 --> 00:16:43,799
Wait for me!

227
00:16:53,559 --> 00:16:55,753
- Mr. Qi.   - Shu Ya, come.

228
00:16:56,119 --> 00:16:57,592
Sit down and have some tea with me.

229
00:17:03,960 --> 00:17:05,633
There's something I want to ask you.

230
00:17:06,199 --> 00:17:07,199
Ask away.

231
00:17:10,079 --> 00:17:11,079
Look.

232
00:17:17,839 --> 00:17:18,839
Fox fur.

233
00:17:20,040 --> 00:17:21,312
It seems I wasn't mistaken.

234
00:17:22,479 --> 00:17:24,600
I saw her

235
00:17:24,680 --> 00:17:26,273
with a fox demon yesterday.

236
00:17:27,079 --> 00:17:29,033
I thought I was seeing things.

237
00:17:31,359 --> 00:17:32,753
(Could it be Meng Shu?)

238
00:17:34,319 --> 00:17:35,319
Mr. Qi.

239
00:17:35,680 --> 00:17:37,432
Yuan Bao can be quite gullible.

240
00:17:38,400 --> 00:17:40,192
And fox demons are good at bewitching people.

241
00:17:41,199 --> 00:17:42,273
I'm worried about Yuan Bao.

242
00:17:44,512 --> 00:17:45,512
Don't worry.

243
00:17:46,160 --> 00:17:47,312
I'll keep an eye on it.

244
00:17:48,199 --> 00:17:49,913
Yuan Bao, where shall we go today?

245
00:17:50,719 --> 00:17:51,719
Let's look around first.

246
00:17:51,858 --> 00:17:52,858
Okay.

247
00:17:57,332 --> 00:17:59,065
(Beixuan Inn)

248
00:17:59,880 --> 00:18:01,560
Go ahead first. I'll be right back.

249
00:18:01,719 --> 00:18:02,719
Yuan Bao!

250
00:18:04,079 --> 00:18:05,993
She clearly wants to see Mr. Chang Yue.

251
00:18:06,599 --> 00:18:07,599
Let's go.

252
00:18:07,732 --> 00:18:08,732
Let's go.

253
00:18:21,319 --> 00:18:22,319
Your Highness.

254
00:18:22,520 --> 00:18:23,520
You were gone all night.

255
00:18:23,599 --> 00:18:24,832
Did you retrieve Mohun?

256
00:18:27,160 --> 00:18:28,192
No?

257
00:18:28,719 --> 00:18:30,479
Did Qi Yuan Bao try to take it for herself?

258
00:18:30,719 --> 00:18:31,852
That's no good. I...

259
00:18:40,272 --> 00:18:41,005
How can I help?

260
00:18:46,719 --> 00:18:48,200
It's not something

261
00:18:48,280 --> 00:18:49,712
very important.

262
00:18:51,079 --> 00:18:52,673
Isn't this Young Lady Qi?

263
00:18:53,079 --> 00:18:54,600
You were at death's door just a few days ago.

264
00:18:54,680 --> 00:18:55,680
Things were looking grim.

265
00:18:55,839 --> 00:18:57,480
And now, after just a few days,

266
00:18:57,560 --> 00:18:58,560
you're lively and energetic.

267
00:18:59,800 --> 00:19:02,553
I bet you must have received help from someone powerful.

268
00:19:04,920 --> 00:19:07,490
That's why I came here.

269
00:19:07,852 --> 00:19:08,554
Tell me about it.

270
00:19:08,920 --> 00:19:09,920
Master,

271
00:19:10,319 --> 00:19:11,832
considering we are master and disciple,

272
00:19:12,040 --> 00:19:13,480
I now have something very important

273
00:19:13,560 --> 00:19:14,712
that requires your help.

274
00:19:16,920 --> 00:19:17,920
You see,

275
00:19:18,079 --> 00:19:19,639
I want to pick a gift

276
00:19:19,719 --> 00:19:20,719
for my benefactor.

277
00:19:20,760 --> 00:19:22,993
But I don't know what to pick.

278
00:19:23,414 --> 00:19:24,934
I believe he'll like

279
00:19:24,959 --> 00:19:25,959
whatever you choose, Master.

280
00:19:27,359 --> 00:19:29,359
Did she

281
00:19:29,439 --> 00:19:30,439
find out already?

282
00:19:36,839 --> 00:19:38,680
Go. Just say yes.

283
00:19:38,760 --> 00:19:40,759
Your Highness, our top priority right now

284
00:19:40,839 --> 00:19:41,839
is to retrieve your soul.

285
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:43,273
You can do that if you go with her.

286
00:19:43,520 --> 00:19:45,279
Besides, she

287
00:19:45,359 --> 00:19:46,513
is picking a gift for you.

288
00:19:47,293 --> 00:19:48,926
You should go with her.

289
00:20:00,359 --> 00:20:02,199
Weren't you going to pick a gift for your benefactor?

290
00:20:02,359 --> 00:20:03,359
That's not important.

291
00:20:05,800 --> 00:20:07,879
I mean these little trinkets on the street

292
00:20:07,959 --> 00:20:09,312
aren't worthy of my benefactor

293
00:20:09,560 --> 00:20:11,153
I have to choose carefully.

294
00:20:11,439 --> 00:20:12,439
Very carefully.

295
00:20:14,680 --> 00:20:16,359
What's that smell? Did you fart?

296
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:18,000
You...

297
00:20:18,479 --> 00:20:20,793
I hate it when someone points at another person with their fingers.

298
00:20:21,520 --> 00:20:23,239
Are you sure you're a person?

299
00:20:23,599 --> 00:20:24,999
What did you say? What...

300
00:20:25,079 --> 00:20:26,239
- You...   - Let go.

301
00:20:26,319 --> 00:20:27,999
- Let go.   - Let go, you hideous creature.

302
00:20:28,079 --> 00:20:29,999
- You let go first.   - We let go at the count to three.

303
00:20:30,079 --> 00:20:31,352
Three, two, one!

304
00:20:31,760 --> 00:20:32,760
Don't you touch me.

305
00:20:33,359 --> 00:20:35,199
Master, let's go in and have a look.

306
00:20:37,040 --> 00:20:38,440
- Yuan Bao.   - They are shopping.

307
00:20:38,520 --> 00:20:39,520
Don't be nosy.

308
00:20:39,560 --> 00:20:40,560
Let's go.

309
00:20:42,079 --> 00:20:43,279
Master, come and see

310
00:20:43,359 --> 00:20:44,359
if there's anything you like.

311
00:20:45,599 --> 00:20:46,599
I'm fine with anything.

312
00:20:46,680 --> 00:20:48,439
Don't say that. Just pick something.

313
00:20:49,239 --> 00:20:50,432
You are here, Young Lady Qi.

314
00:20:51,160 --> 00:20:53,072
Are you picking a gift for your beau?

315
00:20:57,599 --> 00:20:59,200
Anyway, sir, let's not dally.

316
00:20:59,280 --> 00:21:01,072
Bring out the best stuff in your shop.

317
00:21:01,319 --> 00:21:02,319
Sure.

318
00:21:05,359 --> 00:21:07,072
How about this one?

319
00:21:07,359 --> 00:21:09,080
This gem embedded in it

320
00:21:09,160 --> 00:21:11,472
took the artisans three years to polish.

321
00:21:12,079 --> 00:21:13,759
And this pattern is...

322
00:21:13,839 --> 00:21:14,839
That's enough.

323
00:21:15,199 --> 00:21:16,800
Master, what do you think?

324
00:21:17,599 --> 00:21:18,599
Very good.

325
00:21:19,040 --> 00:21:20,040
Let's take it.

326
00:21:20,479 --> 00:21:21,800
Excellent choice.

327
00:21:21,880 --> 00:21:22,880
I'll wrap it up for you.

328
00:21:32,839 --> 00:21:35,472
Bravo.

329
00:21:39,839 --> 00:21:41,320
Bravo.

330
00:21:41,400 --> 00:21:43,079
- Wow.   - Again.

331
00:21:43,560 --> 00:21:45,753
Bravo.

332
00:21:45,839 --> 00:21:47,359
- Come buy a comb.   - Xue Han Yu.

333
00:21:52,280 --> 00:21:53,280
What about this one?

334
00:21:55,839 --> 00:21:57,913
Girls like these kinds of things?

335
00:21:58,560 --> 00:21:59,560
Yes.

336
00:22:00,520 --> 00:22:01,840
Okay, I'll take it.

337
00:22:01,920 --> 00:22:02,920
Thank you, mister.

338
00:22:04,319 --> 00:22:05,319
You're too kind.

339
00:22:05,520 --> 00:22:06,673
You paid for it.

340
00:22:07,199 --> 00:22:08,553
I feel so bad.

341
00:22:10,839 --> 00:22:11,840
Why?

342
00:22:11,920 --> 00:22:13,312
Yuan Bao will definitely like it.

343
00:22:19,640 --> 00:22:20,640
What are you spacing out for?

344
00:22:20,760 --> 00:22:21,760
Aren't you buying one too?

345
00:22:22,079 --> 00:22:23,079
Pay up.

346
00:22:28,479 --> 00:22:29,479
I don't want it anymore.

347
00:22:33,160 --> 00:22:34,160
Why is she mad again?

348
00:22:35,640 --> 00:22:37,913
I'm sorry. My friend is a little...

349
00:22:41,640 --> 00:22:42,673
Young Lady Qi.

350
00:22:43,760 --> 00:22:45,072
It's been a while.

351
00:22:47,400 --> 00:22:49,239
What a handsome man.

352
00:22:49,319 --> 00:22:50,440
Look at those eyebrows.

353
00:22:50,520 --> 00:22:51,753
(Anyway,)

354
00:22:51,839 --> 00:22:53,432
(I acted inappropriately first.)

355
00:22:54,079 --> 00:22:56,201
(Perhaps I should buy a gift to make up to him.)

356
00:22:56,281 --> 00:22:57,393
What's your name?

357
00:22:57,959 --> 00:22:59,312
Where do you live?

358
00:22:59,760 --> 00:23:00,760
How old are you, mister?

359
00:23:02,800 --> 00:23:04,520
Madam, what are you doing?

360
00:23:04,640 --> 00:23:06,033
We're here to buy raiment,

361
00:23:06,160 --> 00:23:07,560
not for you to pry about our details.

362
00:23:07,695 --> 00:23:09,055
Right. You came

363
00:23:09,080 --> 00:23:10,192
at the right time.

364
00:23:10,335 --> 00:23:11,496
Look, our store

365
00:23:11,521 --> 00:23:12,952
just imported many new robes.

366
00:23:13,079 --> 00:23:15,159
Young Lady Qi, are you buying it

367
00:23:15,184 --> 00:23:16,184
for your friend here?

368
00:23:18,160 --> 00:23:19,720
Young Lady Qi, please come inside.

369
00:23:19,800 --> 00:23:21,072
Let me show you around.

370
00:23:21,485 --> 00:23:22,560
- Mister.   - Madam.

371
00:23:22,640 --> 00:23:23,961
No need to get handsy. I can do this.

372
00:23:24,041 --> 00:23:25,633
Come take a look.

373
00:23:25,760 --> 00:23:26,832
Look at this style.

374
00:23:26,920 --> 00:23:28,960
No need, Madam. We'll pick one ourselves.

375
00:23:29,040 --> 00:23:30,040
You can go back to your work.

376
00:23:30,319 --> 00:23:31,319
Okay.

377
00:23:31,640 --> 00:23:33,081
Stop staring. Attend to other customers.

378
00:23:33,106 --> 00:23:34,297
Take your time.

379
00:23:39,319 --> 00:23:40,633
So Master,

380
00:23:40,746 --> 00:23:41,746
do you see anything you like?

381
00:23:42,680 --> 00:23:43,680
I have enough robes already.

382
00:23:43,760 --> 00:23:44,760
Not enough.

383
00:23:44,800 --> 00:23:46,192
You can never have too many robes.

384
00:23:46,479 --> 00:23:47,479
You won't pick one?

385
00:23:48,439 --> 00:23:49,439
I'll pick one for you.

386
00:23:54,160 --> 00:23:55,480
Most of your robes

387
00:23:55,560 --> 00:23:56,560
are white.

388
00:23:57,800 --> 00:23:59,112
You should try other colors.

389
00:24:03,119 --> 00:24:04,119
Master.

390
00:24:06,138 --> 00:24:07,138
What about this one?

391
00:24:08,239 --> 00:24:09,352
I've never worn blue before.

392
00:24:10,439 --> 00:24:12,664
So what? Master, you're naturally beautiful.

393
00:24:12,744 --> 00:24:13,898
Blue suits your style even more.

394
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:15,232
I think this is the one.

395
00:24:17,959 --> 00:24:20,080
Young Lady Qi, you really have a good eye,

396
00:24:20,160 --> 00:24:21,553
You found a handsome partner.

397
00:24:22,680 --> 00:24:24,753
Keep it down. We're not even there yet.

398
00:24:28,119 --> 00:24:30,132
It's been so long. Why isn't he out yet?

399
00:24:31,079 --> 00:24:32,079
Xiao Tao,

400
00:24:32,160 --> 00:24:33,640
go check if the mister

401
00:24:33,720 --> 00:24:34,800
encounters any difficulties.

402
00:24:34,880 --> 00:24:35,880
Okay.

403
00:24:36,920 --> 00:24:38,993
Mister, should I give you a hand?

404
00:24:42,599 --> 00:24:43,599
Wait. Let me.

405
00:24:43,679 --> 00:24:44,832
Let me help him.

406
00:24:45,920 --> 00:24:47,399
No need. I can handle this.

407
00:24:47,479 --> 00:24:49,079
You can go now. Let me handle this.

408
00:25:05,199 --> 00:25:08,112
How old are you?

409
00:25:08,199 --> 00:25:09,592
You can't even tie a belt?

410
00:25:11,439 --> 00:25:13,712
This belt is too complicated.

411
00:25:15,199 --> 00:25:17,913
Then should I

412
00:25:18,319 --> 00:25:19,873
give you a proper lesson?

413
00:25:23,800 --> 00:25:25,153
Where's your manners?

414
00:25:28,018 --> 00:25:29,291
Let me help you tie it.

415
00:25:34,640 --> 00:25:36,312
Lift your hand a little.

416
00:26:31,400 --> 00:26:33,393
I'm sorry. I didn't mean to take liberties with you.

417
00:26:36,880 --> 00:26:38,513
No offense taken.

418
00:26:42,280 --> 00:26:43,472
The lighting is bad in here.

419
00:26:43,880 --> 00:26:45,192
Let's go outside and take a look.

420
00:26:58,959 --> 00:27:00,721
This outfit is simply

421
00:27:00,801 --> 00:27:02,072
made for you, mister.

422
00:27:02,439 --> 00:27:03,592
The cut is perfect.

423
00:27:03,680 --> 00:27:06,759
It highlights your good looks and ethereal aura.

424
00:27:06,839 --> 00:27:07,839
Enough.

425
00:27:08,040 --> 00:27:09,560
Stop complimenting. I'll take this one.

426
00:27:09,640 --> 00:27:10,640
All right.

427
00:27:13,959 --> 00:27:14,959
Oh, right.

428
00:27:15,239 --> 00:27:16,393
Tonight,

429
00:27:16,520 --> 00:27:18,153
my father is hosting a banquet at Qishan Sect

430
00:27:18,400 --> 00:27:20,199
to express his sincere gratitude to my benefactor.

431
00:27:20,839 --> 00:27:22,673
Do you want to come?

432
00:27:28,319 --> 00:27:30,159
Qi Huan, keep a close eye on everything.

433
00:27:30,239 --> 00:27:31,720
There absolutely cannot be any mistakes.

434
00:27:31,800 --> 00:27:32,800
Yes, Sect Leader Qi.

435
00:27:32,880 --> 00:27:34,560
Come. Over here.

436
00:27:34,640 --> 00:27:35,325
This way.

437
00:27:35,812 --> 00:27:36,490
Careful.

438
00:27:37,079 --> 00:27:39,082
- Yuan Bao.   - Take it inside.

439
00:27:39,280 --> 00:27:40,280
- Father.   - Uncle Qi.

440
00:27:40,560 --> 00:27:41,560
Hello, Mr. Qi.

441
00:27:42,280 --> 00:27:42,904
Yuan Bao,

442
00:27:43,360 --> 00:27:44,513
I want to speak with you.

443
00:27:45,479 --> 00:27:47,153
Uncle Qi, we'll take our leave.

444
00:27:47,640 --> 00:27:48,640
Okay.

445
00:27:50,040 --> 00:27:50,671
Give it to me.

446
00:27:51,199 --> 00:27:52,199
Hurry up and give it to me.

447
00:27:52,719 --> 00:27:54,273
Father, what do you want to talk to me about?

448
00:27:55,079 --> 00:27:56,079
Yuan Bao,

449
00:27:56,400 --> 00:27:58,080
what did you do down the mountain today?

450
00:27:58,160 --> 00:27:59,680
- Did you have fun?   - I did.

451
00:27:59,760 --> 00:28:01,952
I went to Beixuan City to pick out a thank-you gift for Shu Ya.

452
00:28:03,040 --> 00:28:04,192
Who did you go with?

453
00:28:05,760 --> 00:28:07,080
I went with Xue Han Yu

454
00:28:07,160 --> 00:28:08,513
and Su Qian Qian.

455
00:28:14,800 --> 00:28:15,800
Look.

456
00:28:16,119 --> 00:28:17,273
Do you know what this is?

457
00:28:20,239 --> 00:28:21,239
This...

458
00:28:21,839 --> 00:28:23,832
Isn't this fox fur?

459
00:28:24,047 --> 00:28:25,601
Father, foxes have disappeared

460
00:28:25,681 --> 00:28:27,192
from the mortal realm for a hundred years.

461
00:28:27,439 --> 00:28:28,793
How come you have this?

462
00:28:29,880 --> 00:28:30,880
You really don't know?

463
00:28:38,839 --> 00:28:39,839
Mr. Qi,

464
00:28:41,599 --> 00:28:43,472
regarding the fox matter, did Yuan Bao say anything?

465
00:28:45,199 --> 00:28:46,232
She didn't say anything.

466
00:28:46,880 --> 00:28:47,880
In my opinion,

467
00:28:47,972 --> 00:28:49,312
this matter must be resolved quickly.

468
00:28:53,400 --> 00:28:55,352
I have an idea.

469
00:29:07,920 --> 00:29:08,920
Here.

470
00:29:22,040 --> 00:29:24,079
Yuan Bao, what are you looking at?

471
00:29:26,586 --> 00:29:27,586
Yuan Bao.

472
00:29:28,119 --> 00:29:29,192
What are you looking at?

473
00:29:29,880 --> 00:29:31,352
Nothing.

474
00:29:31,520 --> 00:29:32,913
Just looking around.

475
00:29:35,199 --> 00:29:36,759
She invited Mr. Chang Yue

476
00:29:36,839 --> 00:29:37,839
to the banquet.

477
00:29:38,160 --> 00:29:39,592
But he hasn't arrived yet.

478
00:29:39,800 --> 00:29:41,153
So, of course, she keeps looking around.

479
00:29:46,719 --> 00:29:47,793
Mr. Chang Yue?

480
00:29:48,520 --> 00:29:50,033
He might not come after all.

481
00:29:50,520 --> 00:29:51,592
He doesn't seem like the type

482
00:29:51,800 --> 00:29:53,753
to enjoy a crowd.

483
00:29:57,760 --> 00:29:59,072
If he doesn't come, so be it.

484
00:30:05,680 --> 00:30:06,680
Here, please.

485
00:30:08,520 --> 00:30:10,359
Sect Leader Qi, Mr. Chang Yue has arrived.

486
00:30:12,119 --> 00:30:13,119
Mr. Chang Yue is here.

487
00:30:17,959 --> 00:30:18,959
Greetings, Sect Leader Qi.

488
00:30:20,479 --> 00:30:21,479
Mr. Chang Yue.

489
00:30:21,520 --> 00:30:22,520
It's been a while.

490
00:30:22,680 --> 00:30:24,352
I thought you had returned to Taiyi Mountain.

491
00:30:24,959 --> 00:30:26,359
I did return to my sect

492
00:30:26,439 --> 00:30:27,553
to take care of something urgent.

493
00:30:29,920 --> 00:30:31,793
You seem a little out of it.

494
00:30:32,079 --> 00:30:33,239
Should I have a physician

495
00:30:33,264 --> 00:30:34,264
take a look at you?

496
00:30:35,439 --> 00:30:36,553
Thank you, Sect Leader Qi.

497
00:30:36,920 --> 00:30:38,639
It's just that I'm a little tired

498
00:30:38,719 --> 00:30:39,753
from the journey.

499
00:30:41,119 --> 00:30:42,701
Very well. Please take a seat.

500
00:30:49,160 --> 00:30:51,159
Master seems to have

501
00:30:51,239 --> 00:30:52,633
lost a lot of weight recently.

502
00:30:53,199 --> 00:30:54,199
Mr. Chang Yue.

503
00:30:55,760 --> 00:30:56,760
What's going on?

504
00:30:58,959 --> 00:30:59,959
It's been a while.

505
00:31:04,319 --> 00:31:05,319
Master.

506
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:18,072
Sect Leader Qi, all guests have arrived.

507
00:31:18,400 --> 00:31:20,472
The banquet can officially begin.

508
00:31:20,920 --> 00:31:21,920
Okay.

509
00:31:34,239 --> 00:31:35,239
Ladies and gentlemen.

510
00:31:35,680 --> 00:31:37,712
A few months ago, my daughter was seriously ill.

511
00:31:37,839 --> 00:31:39,232
Her life was in danger several times.

512
00:31:39,680 --> 00:31:42,201
All of you here helped to find the medicine to cure my daughter.

513
00:31:42,281 --> 00:31:44,112
I am extremely grateful.

514
00:31:45,560 --> 00:31:46,560
Today's banquet

515
00:31:46,800 --> 00:31:47,840
is one, to celebrate

516
00:31:47,920 --> 00:31:49,080
my daughter's successful recovery,

517
00:31:49,160 --> 00:31:51,399
and two, to express my sincere gratitude

518
00:31:51,479 --> 00:31:53,273
to my daughter's savior.

519
00:31:53,599 --> 00:31:54,841
- Let's all   - How did they find out

520
00:31:54,921 --> 00:31:56,112
- raise a glass.   - it was me?

521
00:32:09,319 --> 00:32:09,832
Yuan Bao.

522
00:32:10,640 --> 00:32:11,759
Didn't you say you have a gift

523
00:32:11,784 --> 00:32:13,057
for your savior?

524
00:32:13,807 --> 00:32:14,364
That's right.

525
00:32:37,040 --> 00:32:38,040
Shu Ya.

526
00:32:38,079 --> 00:32:39,079
Thank you for saving me.

527
00:32:39,319 --> 00:32:40,319
This is for you.

528
00:32:45,319 --> 00:32:46,720
If you hadn't gone to Yutao Snow Mountain

529
00:32:46,800 --> 00:32:47,952
and bring back Purple Scale Fruit,

530
00:32:48,199 --> 00:32:49,553
I would've died long ago.

531
00:32:49,959 --> 00:32:51,720
This dagger is not very expensive,

532
00:32:51,800 --> 00:32:53,033
but it contains my appreciation.

533
00:32:53,520 --> 00:32:54,520
Please accept it.

534
00:32:54,839 --> 00:32:56,520
Yuan Bao, between you and me,

535
00:32:56,600 --> 00:32:57,753
there's no need to be so polite.

536
00:32:58,079 --> 00:32:59,079
As long as I can save you,

537
00:32:59,119 --> 00:33:00,232
I'm willing

538
00:33:00,599 --> 00:33:01,599
to risk my life.

539
00:33:02,920 --> 00:33:05,119
They grew up together.

540
00:33:05,199 --> 00:33:06,952
They have a strong bond.

541
00:33:07,040 --> 00:33:08,040
Indeed.

542
00:33:08,920 --> 00:33:09,920
(So)

543
00:33:10,599 --> 00:33:12,072
(she put in all the effort)

544
00:33:13,160 --> 00:33:14,513
(for Mr. Huo.)

545
00:33:21,239 --> 00:33:22,920
Yuan Bao, what about the other one?

546
00:33:23,000 --> 00:33:24,000
What?

547
00:33:24,400 --> 00:33:25,592
I knew you'd forget.

548
00:33:25,959 --> 00:33:27,479
Bring the gift here.

549
00:33:34,079 --> 00:33:35,079
This isn't...

550
00:33:39,839 --> 00:33:40,839
Huo.

551
00:33:45,839 --> 00:33:46,839
Yuan Bao.

552
00:33:47,520 --> 00:33:48,753
You're too kind.

553
00:34:02,520 --> 00:34:03,520
You have such good taste.

554
00:34:03,920 --> 00:34:04,920
I love it.

555
00:34:07,239 --> 00:34:08,313
I'm glad you like it.

556
00:34:08,719 --> 00:34:10,399
By tradition, women only give robes as a gift

557
00:34:10,479 --> 00:34:11,479
to their lovers.

558
00:34:11,919 --> 00:34:14,152
It seems that Qi Yuan Bao

559
00:34:14,479 --> 00:34:16,073
is very fond of Mr. Huo.

560
00:34:23,280 --> 00:34:25,472
Young Master, since Miss Qi is so thoughtful,

561
00:34:25,679 --> 00:34:27,313
why don't you put it on now?

562
00:34:27,800 --> 00:34:28,800
Right.

563
00:34:29,280 --> 00:34:31,273
Mr. Qi, I'll be right back.

564
00:34:31,520 --> 00:34:32,520
Sure.

565
00:34:56,959 --> 00:34:58,719
- Young Master.   - Is everything in order?

566
00:34:58,959 --> 00:35:00,679
Yes, Young Master.

567
00:35:00,760 --> 00:35:01,265
Good.

568
00:35:03,080 --> 00:35:03,805
This time,

569
00:35:04,439 --> 00:35:05,872
he won't be able to leave.

570
00:35:07,159 --> 00:35:08,432
Another toast to everyone.

571
00:35:18,040 --> 00:35:19,952
Yuan Bao, you're so careless.

572
00:35:20,199 --> 00:35:21,959
You could even forget to give someone the gift.

573
00:35:22,239 --> 00:35:23,239
See?

574
00:35:23,399 --> 00:35:24,632
Fortunately, you have me.

575
00:35:25,600 --> 00:35:26,672
Unfortunately, I have you.

576
00:35:27,335 --> 00:35:30,015
Thanks to you, you've ruined everything.

577
00:35:30,040 --> 00:35:31,593
Who told you to bring that up?

578
00:35:31,959 --> 00:35:32,959
What did I do this time?

579
00:36:00,560 --> 00:36:01,560
Yuan Bao,

580
00:36:01,679 --> 00:36:02,679
I love

581
00:36:02,800 --> 00:36:04,033
the robe a lot.

582
00:36:11,800 --> 00:36:13,120
I'm glad you like it.
