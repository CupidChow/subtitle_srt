1
00:01:49,019 --> 00:01:53,949
(Dear Mr. Heavenly Fox)

2
00:01:54,072 --> 00:01:57,202
(Episode 9)

3
00:02:04,400 --> 00:02:06,762
Yuan Bao.

4
00:02:07,599 --> 00:02:08,962
Yuan Bao.

5
00:02:10,240 --> 00:02:12,002
What happened to her?

6
00:02:16,080 --> 00:02:17,562
Her heart meridian is ruptured.

7
00:02:17,800 --> 00:02:19,482
Her heart meridian is ruptured?

8
00:02:19,720 --> 00:02:21,522
How could this be?

9
00:02:24,786 --> 00:02:26,482
The spiritual power awakened in her body

10
00:02:27,131 --> 00:02:28,522
is too strong.

11
00:02:29,759 --> 00:02:31,122
Her body is weak.

12
00:02:31,759 --> 00:02:33,082
She couldn't bear it.

13
00:02:34,080 --> 00:02:35,522
So it backfired on her.

14
00:02:35,679 --> 00:02:36,922
How could this happen?

15
00:02:37,050 --> 00:02:39,362
Then is she doomed?

16
00:02:41,279 --> 00:02:42,279
No.

17
00:02:42,679 --> 00:02:44,192
No.

18
00:02:44,839 --> 00:02:46,399
Yuan Bao, we're going home now.

19
00:02:46,520 --> 00:02:48,682
Uncle Qi will definitely have a way to save you. Let's go!

20
00:02:49,839 --> 00:02:51,882
Xue Han Yu, wait for me!

21
00:02:52,984 --> 00:02:54,242
Xue Han Yu.

22
00:02:55,080 --> 00:02:58,244
- Xue Han Yu.   - Yuan Bao, I'm taking you back now.

23
00:02:58,684 --> 00:03:00,682
Uncle Qi definitely has a way to save you.

24
00:03:00,919 --> 00:03:02,593
Just wait a moment.

25
00:03:02,759 --> 00:03:04,442
Xue Han Yu, be careful!

26
00:03:08,351 --> 00:03:10,642
- Be careful.   - It's okay, Yuan Bao.

27
00:03:10,798 --> 00:03:12,119
- I'll take you home.   - Xue Han Yu,

28
00:03:12,238 --> 00:03:13,800
Uncle Qi definitely has a way to save you.

29
00:03:13,934 --> 00:03:15,086
Wait.

30
00:03:16,199 --> 00:03:19,361
- Get out of the way!   - Mr. Xue, calm down. Put her down.

31
00:03:19,527 --> 00:03:20,785
I told you to get out of the way!

32
00:03:26,039 --> 00:03:27,962
Chang Yue, give Yuan Bao back.

33
00:03:28,973 --> 00:03:29,578
Young Lady!

34
00:03:44,559 --> 00:03:45,762
Yun Rong.

35
00:03:46,221 --> 00:03:47,343
What are you doing here?

36
00:03:47,479 --> 00:03:48,513
What's going on?

37
00:03:49,479 --> 00:03:51,522
You are strong. How could you be injured like this?

38
00:03:52,080 --> 00:03:53,873
Qi Yuan Bao had a surge of spiritual power.

39
00:03:54,160 --> 00:03:55,402
And I was no match for her.

40
00:03:55,600 --> 00:03:56,922
Qi Yuan Bao?

41
00:03:59,039 --> 00:04:01,562
Her spirit root was completely severed by her father.

42
00:04:01,759 --> 00:04:03,802
How can she be so strong now?

43
00:04:04,119 --> 00:04:05,482
Shen Shen,

44
00:04:06,440 --> 00:04:07,922
do not

45
00:04:08,320 --> 00:04:09,841
pry into this.

46
00:04:11,559 --> 00:04:12,559
Okay.

47
00:04:13,279 --> 00:04:14,682
I won't pry then.

48
00:04:14,919 --> 00:04:15,919
Anyway,

49
00:04:16,119 --> 00:04:18,682
I don't have to keep an eye on Qi Yuan Bao for my father anymore.

50
00:04:19,160 --> 00:04:21,482
Now that her heart meridian is broken,

51
00:04:21,920 --> 00:04:23,242
she will surely die.

52
00:04:25,239 --> 00:04:27,082
Her heart meridian is broken?

53
00:04:30,440 --> 00:04:31,440
This is bad.

54
00:04:32,839 --> 00:04:33,839
Sir,

55
00:04:34,079 --> 00:04:35,602
do you have a way to save her?

56
00:04:36,056 --> 00:04:37,722
I'm sorry.

57
00:04:39,239 --> 00:04:41,479
Is there truly no way to save her?

58
00:04:41,560 --> 00:04:43,482
Sect Leader Qi, you know very well

59
00:04:43,720 --> 00:04:45,112
that those with a severed heart meridian

60
00:04:45,279 --> 00:04:46,802
are beyond medical help.

61
00:04:47,320 --> 00:04:49,442
Even if Young Master intervenes,

62
00:04:49,959 --> 00:04:51,522
he won't be able to do anything.

63
00:05:00,391 --> 00:05:01,391
Yuan Bao,

64
00:05:02,880 --> 00:05:04,362
open your eyes and look at me.

65
00:05:05,953 --> 00:05:06,695
Yuan Bao,

66
00:05:07,600 --> 00:05:09,282
open your eyes and look at me.

67
00:05:09,810 --> 00:05:11,202
I'm Han Yu.

68
00:05:13,239 --> 00:05:13,816
Yuan Bao.

69
00:05:17,345 --> 00:05:18,482
Yuan Bao.

70
00:05:18,920 --> 00:05:20,482
- Master.   - Master.

71
00:05:20,799 --> 00:05:21,840
- Master.   - Uncle Qi,

72
00:05:21,950 --> 00:05:23,442
please save Yuan Bao.

73
00:05:36,079 --> 00:05:37,079
Uncle Qi,

74
00:05:37,359 --> 00:05:38,672
do you have a way to save Yuan Bao?

75
00:05:40,440 --> 00:05:41,440
Yes.

76
00:05:42,399 --> 00:05:43,799
- Yuan Bao is saved!   - There's a way!

77
00:05:44,480 --> 00:05:45,480
Sir,

78
00:05:45,679 --> 00:05:46,797
are you sacrificing your life?

79
00:05:46,880 --> 00:05:47,996
You'll use your cultivation

80
00:05:48,079 --> 00:05:49,593
to protect Yuan Bao's heart meridian?

81
00:05:49,679 --> 00:05:50,679
- Master.   - This is...

82
00:05:51,559 --> 00:05:53,232
As Yuan Bao's father,

83
00:05:54,160 --> 00:05:56,633
I failed to protect her.

84
00:05:57,559 --> 00:05:59,237
If I can trade my life for hers,

85
00:05:59,320 --> 00:06:00,512
why not?

86
00:06:00,920 --> 00:06:01,957
Master!

87
00:06:02,040 --> 00:06:04,079
No, Master. Even if you do that,

88
00:06:04,399 --> 00:06:06,397
Yuan Bao will only be able to last

89
00:06:06,480 --> 00:06:07,993
for three months.

90
00:06:08,440 --> 00:06:10,240
- He's right, Sect Leader.   - Master,.

91
00:06:10,320 --> 00:06:11,320
Don't do this, Master.

92
00:06:11,799 --> 00:06:13,117
Don't do this, Master.

93
00:06:13,200 --> 00:06:14,200
Don't do this, Master.

94
00:06:14,239 --> 00:06:16,232
Enough. Stop talking.

95
00:06:17,040 --> 00:06:18,156
My mind is made up.

96
00:06:18,239 --> 00:06:19,239
All of you, leave.

97
00:06:19,320 --> 00:06:20,917
Master, don't do this!

98
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:22,440
- Don't do this, Master.   - Don't do this.

99
00:06:22,520 --> 00:06:24,193
Master!

100
00:06:24,320 --> 00:06:25,320
Get out!

101
00:06:26,600 --> 00:06:28,517
- Sect Leader Qi.   - Master.

102
00:06:28,600 --> 00:06:29,600
In the future, you must

103
00:06:29,640 --> 00:06:31,352
do your best to protect Yuan Bao.

104
00:06:31,959 --> 00:06:33,552
I don't need her to be an accomplished person.

105
00:06:34,200 --> 00:06:35,200
I only want her

106
00:06:35,480 --> 00:06:36,677
to spend her last days

107
00:06:36,760 --> 00:06:38,593
happily.

108
00:06:39,799 --> 00:06:41,672
Sect Leader Qi, don't do this!

109
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:43,276
Don't do this, Sect Leader.

110
00:06:43,359 --> 00:06:44,392
Master.

111
00:06:46,880 --> 00:06:47,952
I'm useless.

112
00:06:50,239 --> 00:06:53,072
I didn't protect Yuan Bao.

113
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:55,000
And now,

114
00:06:55,040 --> 00:06:57,232
I failed to protect you as well, Uncle Qi.

115
00:06:58,799 --> 00:07:00,232
It's my fault.

116
00:07:01,799 --> 00:07:02,799
Shen Shen.

117
00:07:03,239 --> 00:07:05,232
Qi Yuan Bao will die because of me.

118
00:07:07,799 --> 00:07:08,799
Don't overthink it.

119
00:07:09,359 --> 00:07:10,359
She'll be fine.

120
00:07:13,679 --> 00:07:14,679
Uncle Qi.

121
00:07:16,440 --> 00:07:17,633
I'm sorry.

122
00:07:34,600 --> 00:07:36,200
(Your Highness, are you...)

123
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:38,000
(You can't do this.)

124
00:07:38,359 --> 00:07:40,153
(Mohun is the source of the heavenly fox's power.)

125
00:07:40,320 --> 00:07:41,792
(It's crucial for you!)

126
00:07:43,359 --> 00:07:44,359
No need to dissuade me.

127
00:08:20,959 --> 00:08:21,959
Chang Yue.

128
00:08:25,839 --> 00:08:27,433
I'm in so much pain.

129
00:08:46,159 --> 00:08:47,880
(Mohun can only protect you for a month.)

130
00:08:49,479 --> 00:08:50,633
(But I know there's one thing)

131
00:08:51,479 --> 00:08:52,833
(that can save you.)

132
00:08:54,440 --> 00:08:55,440
(I'm going to get it now.)

133
00:08:56,679 --> 00:08:57,679
(Yuan Bao,)

134
00:08:59,280 --> 00:09:00,280
(wait for me to come back.)

135
00:09:11,599 --> 00:09:12,599
This is Mohun.

136
00:09:14,039 --> 00:09:15,393
It can temporarily relieve your pain.

137
00:09:17,919 --> 00:09:19,552
Remember to always carry it with you.

138
00:09:58,760 --> 00:10:00,792
Let me treat your wounds.

139
00:10:02,479 --> 00:10:03,792
Yuan Bao's wounds haven't healed yet.

140
00:10:04,479 --> 00:10:05,479
My wounds

141
00:10:06,039 --> 00:10:07,039
aren't important.

142
00:10:19,400 --> 00:10:20,873
I feel like I'm a useless person.

143
00:10:23,919 --> 00:10:24,919
Since I was little,

144
00:10:25,359 --> 00:10:26,993
Yuan Bao has always been protecting me.

145
00:10:29,400 --> 00:10:31,193
When it was my turn to protect her,

146
00:10:32,359 --> 00:10:33,712
I couldn't do anything.

147
00:10:36,400 --> 00:10:37,513
Even Uncle Qi is...

148
00:10:45,359 --> 00:10:46,359
I even need someone

149
00:10:47,400 --> 00:10:48,633
to dress my wounds.

150
00:10:51,760 --> 00:10:52,760
What can I do?

151
00:10:54,840 --> 00:10:55,840
I'm sorry.

152
00:11:00,359 --> 00:11:01,359
No need to apologize.

153
00:11:02,200 --> 00:11:03,513
I'm the one who should be apologizing.

154
00:11:04,520 --> 00:11:05,520
It has nothing to do with you.

155
00:11:06,080 --> 00:11:07,080
But in my eyes,

156
00:11:07,520 --> 00:11:08,993
you've never been a useless person.

157
00:11:11,479 --> 00:11:13,513
You got out just now.

158
00:11:14,119 --> 00:11:15,193
But for Qi Yuan Bao,

159
00:11:16,039 --> 00:11:17,513
you were willing to risk your life

160
00:11:17,760 --> 00:11:19,273
and go back to save her without hesitation.

161
00:11:19,880 --> 00:11:20,880
How is someone like that

162
00:11:20,960 --> 00:11:22,073
a useless person?

163
00:11:24,479 --> 00:11:25,993
But she still got hurt because of me.

164
00:11:26,919 --> 00:11:28,232
I shouldn't have gone back.

165
00:11:28,320 --> 00:11:29,833
That's because she loves you.

166
00:11:30,840 --> 00:11:32,472
She's as selfless as you are.

167
00:11:32,760 --> 00:11:33,760
If

168
00:11:33,919 --> 00:11:35,840
you hadn't been so selfless for her,

169
00:11:36,520 --> 00:11:37,753
I would have looked down on you.

170
00:11:38,400 --> 00:11:39,400
That cowardly you

171
00:11:40,080 --> 00:11:41,352
would truly be a useless person.

172
00:11:46,200 --> 00:11:47,200
Think about my wounds.

173
00:11:47,599 --> 00:11:49,997
If it weren't for your quick reaction back then

174
00:11:50,080 --> 00:11:51,080
that saved my life,

175
00:11:51,200 --> 00:11:52,592
I would have been dead by now.

176
00:11:53,239 --> 00:11:54,273
I wouldn't have the chance

177
00:11:54,400 --> 00:11:55,633
to ramble with you?

178
00:11:57,039 --> 00:11:58,039
You...

179
00:11:58,760 --> 00:12:00,193
don't blame me for cutting you?

180
00:12:01,039 --> 00:12:02,039
That's different.

181
00:12:02,080 --> 00:12:03,080
It's still your fault.

182
00:12:04,280 --> 00:12:06,836
But not everyone has the ability

183
00:12:06,919 --> 00:12:08,273
to save someone from the brink of death.

184
00:12:12,520 --> 00:12:14,152
That makes sense.

185
00:12:14,640 --> 00:12:15,640
Of course.

186
00:12:23,280 --> 00:12:25,073
All right. Don't worry.

187
00:12:25,765 --> 00:12:28,842
Qi Yuan Bao will definitely be fine.

188
00:12:29,159 --> 00:12:30,602
As the saying goes,

189
00:12:31,280 --> 00:12:32,472
a scourge lives for a long time.

190
00:12:32,760 --> 00:12:34,237
And she's a big scourge.

191
00:12:34,320 --> 00:12:34,938
She definitely won't die.

192
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:37,313
The way you comfort people is...

193
00:12:37,753 --> 00:12:38,318
What?

194
00:12:41,400 --> 00:12:42,400
It's a bit unique.

195
00:12:44,880 --> 00:12:45,365
Come.

196
00:13:07,159 --> 00:13:08,159
Yuan Bao.

197
00:13:14,799 --> 00:13:16,873
(Her pulse is gradually stabilizing.)

198
00:13:17,280 --> 00:13:18,313
(What's going on?)

199
00:13:27,760 --> 00:13:28,760
Yu.

200
00:13:29,520 --> 00:13:30,520
Uncle Qi.

201
00:13:30,599 --> 00:13:31,599
I'm here.

202
00:13:32,960 --> 00:13:33,960
- Uncle Qi.   - Master.

203
00:13:37,479 --> 00:13:39,159
Did anyone enter this room just now?

204
00:13:39,440 --> 00:13:40,440
No.

205
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:43,000
No.

206
00:13:43,520 --> 00:13:44,881
It's true. We were just

207
00:13:44,961 --> 00:13:46,112
guarding outside the whole time.

208
00:13:47,320 --> 00:13:49,119
Uncle Qi, how is Yuan Bao?

209
00:13:50,200 --> 00:13:51,753
She is safe for now.

210
00:13:53,280 --> 00:13:55,076
- How wonderful.   -See? I told you.

211
00:13:55,159 --> 00:13:56,557
Qi Yuan Bao will be fine.

212
00:13:56,640 --> 00:13:57,640
She'll be alright.

213
00:13:58,960 --> 00:14:00,592
Yu, tell everyone

214
00:14:00,799 --> 00:14:02,459
- to return to Qishan Sect immediately.   - Okay.

215
00:14:02,919 --> 00:14:04,440
- Yuan Bao is safe.   - Qi Huan.

216
00:14:04,520 --> 00:14:07,032
- Xue Han Yu.   - Write to all the major sects

217
00:14:07,200 --> 00:14:08,200
and ask them to look out

218
00:14:08,320 --> 00:14:09,993
for elixirs that can protect the heart meridian.

219
00:14:10,200 --> 00:14:11,200
Noted.

220
00:14:11,479 --> 00:14:13,159
- Let's help out.   - Let's go.

221
00:14:22,039 --> 00:14:24,152
Her heart meridian stabilizes all of a sudden.

222
00:14:25,039 --> 00:14:27,273
Could it be that someone powerful helped her?

223
00:14:31,239 --> 00:14:32,753
I told you to capture Qi Yuan Bao.

224
00:14:33,159 --> 00:14:34,159
Instead of capturing her,

225
00:14:34,239 --> 00:14:35,636
you ruptured her heart meridian,

226
00:14:35,719 --> 00:14:36,873
causing her to lose her power.

227
00:14:37,359 --> 00:14:38,792
I didn't expect it to be like this.

228
00:14:38,960 --> 00:14:40,672
Her power surged suddenly

229
00:14:40,919 --> 00:14:41,953
and it backfired on her.

230
00:14:46,400 --> 00:14:47,400
Master,

231
00:14:48,039 --> 00:14:49,393
on the way back, I heard that Qi Lian

232
00:14:50,799 --> 00:14:52,833
wrote to many sects looking for an elixir

233
00:14:53,520 --> 00:14:54,672
to protect the heart meridian.

234
00:14:55,239 --> 00:14:57,352
It seems Qi Yuan Bao

235
00:14:58,479 --> 00:15:01,873
still lives.

236
00:15:07,119 --> 00:15:08,119
Master,

237
00:15:08,159 --> 00:15:09,159
why don't we

238
00:15:09,520 --> 00:15:10,993
take advantage of Qi Yuan Bao's situation

239
00:15:11,359 --> 00:15:12,359
and kidnap her

240
00:15:12,760 --> 00:15:14,420
- to Suiyue Mountain?   - Idiot.

241
00:15:15,880 --> 00:15:17,993
Qi Yuan Bao is seriously injured.

242
00:15:18,159 --> 00:15:19,197
Her spiritual power is gone.

243
00:15:19,280 --> 00:15:21,313
She can't revive the Corpse Puppet King.

244
00:15:21,619 --> 00:15:22,392
Master,

245
00:15:22,840 --> 00:15:24,032
what should we do now?

246
00:15:25,559 --> 00:15:27,032
Where are Huo Chen and the others?

247
00:15:27,159 --> 00:15:28,792
Still on the way to Suiyue Mountain.

248
00:15:32,760 --> 00:15:34,353
- Enjoy your meal, sir.   - Thank you.

249
00:15:42,440 --> 00:15:45,073
(Qi Yuan Bao's heart meridian is ruptured. She may not live long.)

250
00:15:49,460 --> 00:15:50,460
Father,

251
00:15:50,640 --> 00:15:51,640
what's wrong?

252
00:15:52,039 --> 00:15:53,039
Yuan Bao's in danger.

253
00:16:15,599 --> 00:16:16,599
Yuan Bao,

254
00:16:16,760 --> 00:16:17,760
you're awake.

255
00:16:21,159 --> 00:16:22,159
Come, get up.

256
00:16:22,719 --> 00:16:24,179
Yuan Bao, how do you feel?

257
00:16:30,359 --> 00:16:31,552
I remember

258
00:16:31,840 --> 00:16:32,877
that it was Chang Yue

259
00:16:32,960 --> 00:16:34,393
who carried me back to the inn.

260
00:16:34,960 --> 00:16:36,640
How did I get back to my room?

261
00:16:36,880 --> 00:16:40,032
Yuan Bao, you've been unconscious for a week.

262
00:16:40,320 --> 00:16:42,276
I've been unconscious for a week?

263
00:16:42,429 --> 00:16:43,429
Yes.

264
00:16:43,559 --> 00:16:44,559
Shen Shen.

265
00:16:44,919 --> 00:16:48,510
Who do you think kidnapped

266
00:16:48,840 --> 00:16:50,322
me and Xue Han Yu?

267
00:16:50,640 --> 00:16:52,433
They look familiar.

268
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:54,873
But they were all masked.

269
00:16:55,159 --> 00:16:56,159
So I couldn't see clearly.

270
00:16:56,599 --> 00:16:58,472
You stay in Suyun City all the time.

271
00:16:58,640 --> 00:16:59,640
How familiar can they be?

272
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:02,472
Qi Yuan Bao is always causing trouble outside.

273
00:17:03,080 --> 00:17:04,673
Maybe she crossed someone.

274
00:17:05,239 --> 00:17:06,239
She

275
00:17:06,319 --> 00:17:08,400
brought Xue Han Yu and you into harm's way.

276
00:17:08,839 --> 00:17:10,033
It's not Xue Han Yu's fault.

277
00:17:10,400 --> 00:17:11,837
He told me several times

278
00:17:11,920 --> 00:17:13,192
not to follow him.

279
00:17:13,400 --> 00:17:14,753
It was I who...

280
00:17:19,959 --> 00:17:21,873
I'm just saying

281
00:17:22,319 --> 00:17:24,192
that Qi Yuan Bao and Xue Han Yu

282
00:17:24,520 --> 00:17:26,472
are quite nice.

283
00:17:30,640 --> 00:17:31,756
Anyway, Qi Yuan Bao

284
00:17:31,839 --> 00:17:34,192
had her spirit root severed.

285
00:17:34,680 --> 00:17:36,913
How come she has spiritual power again?

286
00:17:37,839 --> 00:17:39,112
That's strange, right?

287
00:17:39,760 --> 00:17:41,312
It is indeed strange.

288
00:17:42,040 --> 00:17:43,917
It was clear that her heart meridian was broken,

289
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:45,072
and she would die soon.

290
00:17:46,199 --> 00:17:48,072
But now, she's completely fine.

291
00:17:56,442 --> 00:17:57,442
(Stay Put)

292
00:17:58,719 --> 00:17:59,832
(Stay Put.)

293
00:18:01,400 --> 00:18:02,516
Is this a letter from Father?

294
00:18:02,599 --> 00:18:04,192
What did he say? When are we going back?

295
00:18:05,479 --> 00:18:07,753
Didn't you always say Beixuan City is boring?

296
00:18:08,199 --> 00:18:09,199
Why?

297
00:18:09,359 --> 00:18:10,882
Now you don't want to leave?

298
00:18:11,359 --> 00:18:12,562
It's not that.

299
00:18:13,800 --> 00:18:14,800
I know.

300
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:17,033
There must be someone in this Qishan Sect

301
00:18:17,160 --> 00:18:18,920
- that you hate to leave.   - No!

302
00:18:19,239 --> 00:18:20,239
How could there be?

303
00:18:23,880 --> 00:18:25,273
Well, if you insist...

304
00:18:26,160 --> 00:18:27,160
I admit

305
00:18:27,400 --> 00:18:29,393
that I don't want to leave this place because of someone.

306
00:18:30,280 --> 00:18:32,072
Qi Yuan Bao

307
00:18:32,280 --> 00:18:34,756
got injured to save me

308
00:18:34,839 --> 00:18:35,839
and Xue Han Yu.

309
00:18:36,040 --> 00:18:37,197
She hasn't even woken up yet,

310
00:18:37,280 --> 00:18:38,280
and I'm already leaving?

311
00:18:38,479 --> 00:18:40,913
Wouldn't that be too selfish?

312
00:18:42,520 --> 00:18:44,072
Right.

313
00:18:44,319 --> 00:18:45,319
I think so too.

314
00:18:45,520 --> 00:18:46,520
I agree with you.

315
00:18:49,680 --> 00:18:51,197
Don't do that again in the future.

316
00:18:51,280 --> 00:18:53,139
You knew it was a trap and you walked into it.

317
00:18:53,520 --> 00:18:55,513
- It's dangerous.   - I know.

318
00:19:17,119 --> 00:19:19,072
(Why am I carrying)

319
00:19:19,520 --> 00:19:21,322
(Chang Yue's precious jade pendant?)

320
00:19:23,040 --> 00:19:24,040
Yuan Bao,

321
00:19:24,359 --> 00:19:25,633
what is this thing?

322
00:19:26,119 --> 00:19:27,273
Ever since you fell unconscious,

323
00:19:27,439 --> 00:19:28,832
you have been carrying it.

324
00:19:30,319 --> 00:19:31,999
Tell me. Where is Chang Yue?

325
00:19:32,079 --> 00:19:33,599
Did he return to Qishan Sect with us?

326
00:19:33,800 --> 00:19:34,832
Why hasn't he come

327
00:19:34,959 --> 00:19:36,192
to see me after I woke up?

328
00:19:36,400 --> 00:19:37,592
Mr. Chang Yue

329
00:19:38,119 --> 00:19:39,913
seems to have disappeared

330
00:19:40,160 --> 00:19:41,192
after you fell unconscious.

331
00:19:41,800 --> 00:19:43,952
He might have returned to Taiyi Mountain by now.

332
00:19:44,599 --> 00:19:45,793
Taiyi Mountain?

333
00:19:48,439 --> 00:19:49,439
Yuan Bao!

334
00:19:49,938 --> 00:19:50,565
Uncle Qi!

335
00:19:50,919 --> 00:19:52,072
- Yuan Bao.   - Father.

336
00:19:52,680 --> 00:19:54,199
Uncle Qi, Yuan Bao woke up.

337
00:19:54,239 --> 00:19:54,972
Good.

338
00:19:58,839 --> 00:20:00,352
Yuan Bao, are you feeling better?

339
00:20:02,319 --> 00:20:03,393
Father will take your pulse.

340
00:20:10,439 --> 00:20:11,439
Uncle Qi,

341
00:20:12,079 --> 00:20:13,116
how is Yuan Bao?

342
00:20:13,199 --> 00:20:14,682
She should be fine now, right?

343
00:20:18,959 --> 00:20:19,959
Much better.

344
00:20:22,199 --> 00:20:23,199
Father,

345
00:20:23,319 --> 00:20:25,112
tell me the truth.

346
00:20:26,680 --> 00:20:27,996
Like I said,

347
00:20:28,079 --> 00:20:29,079
you're much better.

348
00:20:29,160 --> 00:20:30,513
But you still need to rest well.

349
00:20:30,680 --> 00:20:32,352
Don't go hungry or catch a cold.

350
00:20:32,920 --> 00:20:33,920
By the way,

351
00:20:33,959 --> 00:20:35,312
is it cold at night?

352
00:20:35,520 --> 00:20:36,952
Do you want another blanket?

353
00:20:38,920 --> 00:20:39,920
Also,

354
00:20:39,959 --> 00:20:41,192
what delicious food do you want?

355
00:20:41,439 --> 00:20:43,432
I will have the chefs make it for you.

356
00:20:45,599 --> 00:20:46,599
Father.

357
00:20:47,160 --> 00:20:48,192
- Am I...   - Yuan Bao.

358
00:20:48,599 --> 00:20:49,599
I

359
00:20:49,839 --> 00:20:51,352
have urgent business and have to leave first.

360
00:20:52,560 --> 00:20:54,239
Yu, take good care of Yuan Bao.

361
00:20:54,319 --> 00:20:55,319
Okay.

362
00:21:00,280 --> 00:21:01,280
Yuan Bao,

363
00:21:02,439 --> 00:21:03,439
I'll get going now.

364
00:21:12,079 --> 00:21:14,072
Uncle Qi, don't worry, I will take good care of Yuan Bao.

365
00:21:23,119 --> 00:21:24,119
Yuan Bao.

366
00:21:24,280 --> 00:21:26,036
I've noticed that Uncle Qi

367
00:21:26,119 --> 00:21:27,553
is much gentler this time.

368
00:21:27,959 --> 00:21:29,072
He didn't scold you

369
00:21:29,680 --> 00:21:30,962
or punish you.

370
00:21:31,359 --> 00:21:32,633
If it were any other time,

371
00:21:32,880 --> 00:21:34,192
he would have disciplined you already.

372
00:21:36,680 --> 00:21:37,680
(Father, how many more days)

373
00:21:38,400 --> 00:21:41,393
(do I have to live?)

374
00:21:43,920 --> 00:21:44,920
Thank you, sir.

375
00:21:45,079 --> 00:21:46,079
Have a good day, sir.

376
00:21:48,920 --> 00:21:49,920
Father.

377
00:21:53,119 --> 00:21:55,273
You're going to Yutao Snow Mountain for the Purple Scale Fruit?

378
00:21:55,640 --> 00:21:56,640
Yes.

379
00:21:56,680 --> 00:21:58,312
The journey to Yutao Snow Mountain is difficult,

380
00:21:58,560 --> 00:21:59,797
and the fruit grows on the summit,

381
00:21:59,880 --> 00:22:00,880
on a cliff.

382
00:22:01,920 --> 00:22:03,432
It will be very dangerous.

383
00:22:03,800 --> 00:22:04,952
As long as I can save Yuan Bao,

384
00:22:05,199 --> 00:22:06,633
I don't care how dangerous it is.

385
00:22:09,319 --> 00:22:11,072
I know you love Yuan Bao.

386
00:22:11,959 --> 00:22:12,959
You know what?

387
00:22:13,959 --> 00:22:15,513
Huo Ping will go with you.

388
00:22:16,439 --> 00:22:17,753
Be careful on the way.

389
00:22:18,439 --> 00:22:20,553
- Noted.   - Thank you, Father.

390
00:22:21,160 --> 00:22:23,160
Be safe on your trip to Suiyue Mountain.

391
00:22:23,680 --> 00:22:24,680
If anything seems off,

392
00:22:24,920 --> 00:22:26,112
send me a message immediately.

393
00:22:27,680 --> 00:22:28,680
Go now.

394
00:22:36,282 --> 00:22:41,962
(Yuying Court)

395
00:23:34,599 --> 00:23:35,599
Sect Leader Qi.

396
00:23:36,319 --> 00:23:38,273
Sect Leader Qi, how is Young Lady now?

397
00:23:39,199 --> 00:23:41,472
Although there's still a glimmer of hope,

398
00:23:42,160 --> 00:23:44,993
I'm afraid her days are numbered.

399
00:23:46,880 --> 00:23:48,477
We just received replies from the major sects.

400
00:23:48,560 --> 00:23:50,033
Everyone is very supportive.

401
00:23:50,377 --> 00:23:52,094
Shu Ya has gone to find

402
00:23:52,119 --> 00:23:53,352
the Purple Scale Fruit for Yuan Bao.

403
00:23:54,119 --> 00:23:55,513
Shu Ya is truly devoted

404
00:23:56,880 --> 00:23:59,033
to Yuan Bao.

405
00:24:03,079 --> 00:24:04,753
Oh, Chang Yue.

406
00:24:05,160 --> 00:24:06,797
Did you

407
00:24:06,880 --> 00:24:08,393
go back to Taiyi Mountain without a word?

408
00:24:09,439 --> 00:24:10,439
Qi Yuan Bao.

409
00:24:12,760 --> 00:24:13,760
Qi Yuan Bao.

410
00:24:15,199 --> 00:24:16,199
What?

411
00:24:17,760 --> 00:24:18,760
Here.

412
00:24:19,199 --> 00:24:21,516
- What's this?   - The best medicine from my family

413
00:24:21,661 --> 00:24:23,335
that protects your heart meridian.

414
00:24:23,520 --> 00:24:24,553
It's hard to come by.

415
00:24:24,920 --> 00:24:26,797
I don't like to be indebted,

416
00:24:26,880 --> 00:24:28,673
so we're even now.

417
00:24:30,800 --> 00:24:31,800
Just this

418
00:24:32,160 --> 00:24:33,513
and we're even?

419
00:24:33,800 --> 00:24:34,800
You

420
00:24:34,839 --> 00:24:36,673
are quite the businesswoman.

421
00:24:37,520 --> 00:24:38,712
Come on.

422
00:24:39,079 --> 00:24:40,472
You only wanted to save Xue Han Yu.

423
00:24:40,800 --> 00:24:42,153
I was just the collateral.

424
00:24:42,599 --> 00:24:44,770
You can't expect me

425
00:24:44,890 --> 00:24:45,901
to seriously thank you,

426
00:24:45,984 --> 00:24:47,072
can you?

427
00:24:47,399 --> 00:24:48,070
Whatever.

428
00:24:48,418 --> 00:24:49,492
I did not save you

429
00:24:49,920 --> 00:24:51,712
to hear a thank you from you.

430
00:24:52,119 --> 00:24:53,192
Then why did you do it?

431
00:24:54,560 --> 00:24:55,560
Because...

432
00:25:03,040 --> 00:25:06,236
Because you're too weak.

433
00:25:06,319 --> 00:25:07,319
Qi Yuan Bao!

434
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:11,000
And here I thought

435
00:25:11,479 --> 00:25:12,717
you were a good friend.

436
00:25:12,800 --> 00:25:14,072
I thought

437
00:25:14,760 --> 00:25:15,952
you were nice.

438
00:25:16,959 --> 00:25:18,112
You take it back? Give it back.

439
00:25:19,280 --> 00:25:20,432
You don't want it anyway.

440
00:25:21,160 --> 00:25:22,160
You...

441
00:25:22,439 --> 00:25:23,712
Stingy!

442
00:25:32,520 --> 00:25:33,520
Grandmother.

443
00:25:34,280 --> 00:25:36,352
- Something bad happened!   - What happened?

444
00:25:37,180 --> 00:25:43,042
(Wanlu Abyss)

445
00:25:48,040 --> 00:25:49,633
Your Highness, please reconsider!

446
00:25:49,760 --> 00:25:50,957
Do you know where this is?

447
00:25:51,040 --> 00:25:52,717
Wanlu Abyss is a dangerous place.

448
00:25:52,854 --> 00:25:54,450
And you don't even have Mo Hun with you.

449
00:25:54,565 --> 00:25:56,479
Wanlu Abyss could take your life at any moment!

450
00:25:56,880 --> 00:25:58,242
Chang Yue, stop.

451
00:25:58,719 --> 00:26:00,905
Aunt, come talk some sense into His Highness.

452
00:26:01,199 --> 00:26:03,025
Aunt, talk to His Highness.

453
00:26:08,319 --> 00:26:09,319
Aunt.

454
00:26:10,199 --> 00:26:12,153
I will enter Wanlu Abyss today.

455
00:26:12,599 --> 00:26:14,553
Do you know what awaits you?

456
00:26:15,160 --> 00:26:16,352
Have you thought this through?

457
00:26:16,680 --> 00:26:18,432
I know the road ahead is dangerous

458
00:26:18,719 --> 00:26:19,873
and unpredictable.

459
00:26:20,640 --> 00:26:22,520
But if I don't retrieve the Posuo Leaf to save Yuan Bao,

460
00:26:23,599 --> 00:26:24,952
I'll regret it for the rest of my life.

461
00:26:25,800 --> 00:26:27,719
You care so much about that mortal.

462
00:26:28,199 --> 00:26:30,719
You will sacrifice your life for her?

463
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:35,000
Yes.

464
00:26:39,199 --> 00:26:40,199
Chang Yue!

465
00:26:40,599 --> 00:26:42,153
Do you remember your duty?

466
00:26:42,920 --> 00:26:44,520
Grandmother, come.

467
00:26:49,000 --> 00:26:50,753
Grandmother, talk some sense into His Highness.

468
00:27:05,482 --> 00:27:07,912
(Wanlu Abyss)

469
00:27:11,239 --> 00:27:12,239
Grandmother.

470
00:27:13,722 --> 00:27:15,082
Please grant my wish.

471
00:27:15,280 --> 00:27:17,393
What about the survival of the foxes?

472
00:27:22,319 --> 00:27:23,319
For thousands of years,

473
00:27:23,880 --> 00:27:26,952
no one who has entered Wanlu Abyss returned alive.

474
00:27:27,439 --> 00:27:28,921
Do you know how many lost souls,

475
00:27:29,001 --> 00:27:30,192
how many cold remains are in there?

476
00:27:30,560 --> 00:27:32,072
Yet you still want to risk your life?

477
00:27:32,479 --> 00:27:33,479
Grandmother.

478
00:27:34,920 --> 00:27:36,557
I can't hesitate any longer.

479
00:27:36,640 --> 00:27:38,312
I think you've lost your mind.

480
00:27:38,760 --> 00:27:40,192
I've spoiled you too much.

481
00:27:40,920 --> 00:27:41,920
Today,

482
00:27:42,560 --> 00:27:44,393
I must wake you up.

483
00:28:32,079 --> 00:28:33,079
Do you repent?

484
00:28:35,280 --> 00:28:36,553
Aunt, please grant my wish.

485
00:28:37,839 --> 00:28:39,273
Grandmother, please grant my wish.

486
00:28:40,560 --> 00:28:41,560
Chang Yue.

487
00:28:42,160 --> 00:28:44,072
You're so stubborn.

488
00:28:44,719 --> 00:28:45,952
- Grandmother.   - Grandmother.

489
00:28:46,719 --> 00:28:48,273
Chang Yue has made up his mind.

490
00:28:48,640 --> 00:28:49,640
Let's trust him this once

491
00:28:49,839 --> 00:28:50,839
and let him go.

492
00:31:29,439 --> 00:31:30,756
The Great Learning

493
00:31:30,839 --> 00:31:32,153
teaches us to manifest virtues,

494
00:31:32,553 --> 00:31:33,553
to love the people,

495
00:31:34,400 --> 00:31:36,153
and to achieve the highest good.

496
00:31:36,920 --> 00:31:39,072
Having a goal teaches you to focus.

497
00:31:39,479 --> 00:31:41,522
And to focus, one must silence their mind.

498
00:31:42,256 --> 00:31:43,842
A silent mind begets a peaceful mind.

499
00:31:44,254 --> 00:31:45,607
A peaceful mind begets careful planning.

500
00:31:45,888 --> 00:31:47,562
- (Chang Yue.)   - The results thus yield.

501
00:31:47,898 --> 00:31:49,282
Everything has a beginning.

502
00:31:49,592 --> 00:31:50,869
(Where exactly are you now?)

503
00:31:50,894 --> 00:31:51,592
Everything has an end.

504
00:31:52,546 --> 00:31:54,706
Knowing the cycle brings you closer to enlightenment.

505
00:31:55,640 --> 00:31:58,074
- (Chang Yue.)   - To manifest virtues,

506
00:31:58,241 --> 00:32:00,122
- (Where are you?)   - One must govern with virtues.
