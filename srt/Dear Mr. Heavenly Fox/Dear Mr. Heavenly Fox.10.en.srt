00:01:48,962 --> 00:01:54,116
(Dear Mr. Heavenly Fox)

2
00:01:54,202 --> 00:01:57,046
(Episode 10)

3
00:01:57,434 --> 00:02:00,882
It teaches us to love the people and to achieve the highest good.

4
00:02:01,120 --> 00:02:03,229
Having a goal teaches you to focus.

5
00:02:03,854 --> 00:02:06,488
The Great Learning teaches us to manifest virtues,

6
00:02:07,040 --> 00:02:08,322
to love the people,

7
00:02:08,499 --> 00:02:10,162
and to achieve the highest good.

8
00:02:11,160 --> 00:02:12,632
Having a goal teaches you to focus.

9
00:02:12,880 --> 00:02:14,192
To focus, one must silence their mind.

10
00:02:14,919 --> 00:02:15,919
A silent mind...

11
00:02:21,119 --> 00:02:22,119
Yuan Bao.

12
00:02:23,160 --> 00:02:24,517
Yuan Bao.

13
00:02:24,837 --> 00:02:26,282
Yuan Bao.

14
00:02:26,720 --> 00:02:28,082
Focus.

15
00:02:30,725 --> 00:02:32,882
A silent mind begets a peaceful mind.

16
00:02:33,119 --> 00:02:35,322
A peaceful mind begets careful planning.

17
00:02:35,600 --> 00:02:37,632
The results thus yield.

18
00:02:38,639 --> 00:02:41,953
Everything has a beginning. Everything has an end.

19
00:02:42,399 --> 00:02:44,040
- Knowing the cycle   - (Chang Yue.)

20
00:02:44,120 --> 00:02:45,562
brings you closer to enlightenment.

21
00:02:45,880 --> 00:02:47,802
(Where exactly are you now?)

22
00:03:17,160 --> 00:03:18,993
What got into you?

23
00:03:19,320 --> 00:03:20,832
Why did you let Chang Yue in?

24
00:03:21,039 --> 00:03:23,353
He grew up under our watch.

25
00:03:23,679 --> 00:03:24,679
What he makes up his mind,

26
00:03:24,759 --> 00:03:26,353
have we ever been able to stop him?

27
00:03:26,960 --> 00:03:28,433
It's different this time.

28
00:03:28,720 --> 00:03:30,472
Chang Yue is undergoing an in-tandem cultivation.

29
00:03:30,839 --> 00:03:32,513
If Qi Yuan Bao dies,

30
00:03:32,759 --> 00:03:35,392
Chang Yue's soul will also vanish with her.

31
00:03:35,759 --> 00:03:38,073
Saving Qi Yuan Bao is saving us.

32
00:03:38,559 --> 00:03:39,912
Chang Yue is a nine-tailed fox.

33
00:03:40,360 --> 00:03:41,472
He has nine lives.

34
00:03:42,800 --> 00:03:43,912
He will come back alive.

35
00:03:47,600 --> 00:03:48,993
(Nine lives mean nothing.)

36
00:03:51,399 --> 00:03:54,353
(For the suffering he will endure next)

37
00:03:56,119 --> 00:03:57,873
(will be grueling.)

38
00:04:45,880 --> 00:04:46,880
There's a bug.

39
00:04:47,279 --> 00:04:49,193
What? Where?

40
00:04:50,119 --> 00:04:51,232
Look how scared you are.

41
00:04:52,559 --> 00:04:53,559
Qi Yuan Bao.

42
00:04:55,160 --> 00:04:56,392
Yuan Bao, are you okay?

43
00:04:57,160 --> 00:04:58,560
- Are you okay?   - It hurts so much.

44
00:04:58,640 --> 00:04:59,832
Su Qian Qian, what did you do?

45
00:04:59,925 --> 00:05:01,120
- Yuan Bao is sick.   - It hurts!

46
00:05:01,200 --> 00:05:02,361
- Be gentler.   - I swear

47
00:05:02,441 --> 00:05:03,792
I only shoved her gently.

48
00:05:03,880 --> 00:05:05,633
Stop faking it, okay?

49
00:05:07,619 --> 00:05:09,159
- How are you?   - I'm just kidding.

50
00:05:09,239 --> 00:05:10,239
Look how scared you are.

51
00:05:25,799 --> 00:05:26,799
Your Highness!

52
00:05:38,440 --> 00:05:40,476
That's enough. I won't be fooled a second time.

53
00:05:40,559 --> 00:05:42,512
Stop it. It's not funny if you keep doing it.

54
00:06:01,239 --> 00:06:03,433
Isn't this Mr. Chang Yue's belonging?

55
00:06:04,406 --> 00:06:05,640
Why does she have it?

56
00:06:16,320 --> 00:06:17,320
(Chang Yue,)

57
00:06:17,920 --> 00:06:19,552
(did something happen to you?)

58
00:06:53,880 --> 00:06:55,672
One life is already gone.

59
00:06:56,480 --> 00:06:57,913
His Highness can do it.

60
00:06:58,465 --> 00:06:59,480
This time,

61
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:03,232
he was struck by the Heart-Piercing Arrow.

62
00:07:03,920 --> 00:07:05,633
Once struck by it,

63
00:07:06,440 --> 00:07:07,672
even if he survives,

64
00:07:07,920 --> 00:07:09,792
the wound will never heal.

65
00:07:11,359 --> 00:07:14,232
Every night, he will suffer excruciating pain.

66
00:07:15,799 --> 00:07:17,672
He survived the arrow.

67
00:07:18,959 --> 00:07:19,959
And now,

68
00:07:21,079 --> 00:07:23,193
he will face an even more challenging trial,

69
00:07:24,359 --> 00:07:26,033
the Bewitching Illusion.

70
00:08:05,320 --> 00:08:06,433
Jingsi Cliff?

71
00:08:37,520 --> 00:08:38,520
Yuan Bao.

72
00:08:45,039 --> 00:08:46,039
Yuan Bao.

73
00:08:46,760 --> 00:08:47,760
Yuan Bao.

74
00:08:48,440 --> 00:08:49,440
Wake up.

75
00:08:49,760 --> 00:08:50,760
Yuan Bao,

76
00:08:50,960 --> 00:08:51,960
you cannot die.

77
00:08:52,159 --> 00:08:53,159
Yuan Bao.

78
00:08:53,640 --> 00:08:54,640
Yuan Bao.

79
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:56,000
Yuan Bao.

80
00:08:59,559 --> 00:09:00,559
Master.

81
00:09:03,640 --> 00:09:04,640
Master.

82
00:09:05,080 --> 00:09:06,712
Why are you so nervous?

83
00:09:06,953 --> 00:09:07,953
Are you afraid that I'll die?

84
00:09:10,919 --> 00:09:11,919
So,

85
00:09:13,400 --> 00:09:14,753
you do care about me.

86
00:09:17,239 --> 00:09:18,239
No, I don't.

87
00:09:29,760 --> 00:09:30,760
Master.

88
00:09:31,413 --> 00:09:33,166
Your heart is beating so fast.

89
00:09:33,760 --> 00:09:34,682
You're lying.

90
00:09:35,520 --> 00:09:36,520
I know,

91
00:09:36,919 --> 00:09:39,352
you think of me all the time.

92
00:09:47,719 --> 00:09:49,792
When did I ever say that?

93
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:54,112
Not only do you think of me all the time,

94
00:09:54,799 --> 00:09:55,833
you also want

95
00:09:57,559 --> 00:09:59,073
to bathe with me.

96
00:09:59,159 --> 00:10:00,159
No, I don't.

97
00:10:00,239 --> 00:10:01,352
Are you sure?

98
00:10:14,679 --> 00:10:15,712
You're ignoring me again.

99
00:10:18,359 --> 00:10:19,753
You're so boring.

100
00:10:20,599 --> 00:10:21,599
Forget it.

101
00:10:21,679 --> 00:10:23,232
I'm going to find Shu Ya instead.

102
00:10:27,960 --> 00:10:29,032
I won't let you go to him.

103
00:10:31,840 --> 00:10:32,840
Yes,

104
00:10:33,873 --> 00:10:34,873
I did lie.

105
00:10:36,906 --> 00:10:37,906
Right now...

106
00:10:40,406 --> 00:10:41,880
I'm thinking of you all the time.

107
00:10:46,640 --> 00:10:47,640
Chang Yue.

108
00:10:48,760 --> 00:10:49,760
You

109
00:10:50,960 --> 00:10:52,873
really want to be with me?

110
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:37,000
Grandmother,

111
00:11:37,599 --> 00:11:39,152
what will happen in the Bewitching Illusion?

112
00:11:40,159 --> 00:11:41,753
Chang Yue will fall into an illusion.

113
00:11:42,080 --> 00:11:43,317
He will see the person

114
00:11:43,400 --> 00:11:44,433
he cherishes the most.

115
00:11:45,039 --> 00:11:46,117
It's easy to dwell in it,

116
00:11:46,200 --> 00:11:47,200
unable to escape.

117
00:11:50,039 --> 00:11:51,273
If he can't get out,

118
00:11:53,320 --> 00:11:54,712
he loses one life

119
00:11:56,960 --> 00:11:58,712
for every 15 minutes he stays in the illusion.

120
00:12:00,880 --> 00:12:01,880
Chang Yue.

121
00:12:02,400 --> 00:12:03,400
From now on,

122
00:12:04,200 --> 00:12:06,073
stay here with me.

123
00:12:06,660 --> 00:12:07,660
Okay?

124
00:12:10,559 --> 00:12:11,559
Okay.

125
00:12:19,400 --> 00:12:20,400
Chang Yue.

126
00:12:22,599 --> 00:12:23,993
I'm a little tired.

127
00:12:33,320 --> 00:12:34,320
Then you should rest.

128
00:12:35,640 --> 00:12:36,833
I'll stay here with you.

129
00:12:39,907 --> 00:12:40,907
Chang Yue.

130
00:12:43,080 --> 00:12:44,273
I'm in so much pain.

131
00:12:45,599 --> 00:12:46,633
It hurts so much.

132
00:13:00,719 --> 00:13:01,719
(Mister,)

133
00:13:01,880 --> 00:13:03,472
(have we met somewhere before?)

134
00:13:04,880 --> 00:13:05,880
(Little fox,)

135
00:13:06,280 --> 00:13:07,352
(how did you get hurt?)

136
00:13:08,559 --> 00:13:10,712
(Master, please accept this bow from me.)

137
00:13:12,320 --> 00:13:13,320
(Master.)

138
00:13:13,640 --> 00:13:14,640
(Are you looking for me?)

139
00:13:16,440 --> 00:13:17,440
(Chang Yue,)

140
00:13:18,840 --> 00:13:22,152
(where are you now?)

141
00:13:41,682 --> 00:13:43,925
(House of Belle)

142
00:14:07,359 --> 00:14:09,792
Yuan Bao, are you missing Mr. Chang Yue again?

143
00:14:10,799 --> 00:14:12,032
Who said I miss him?

144
00:14:12,359 --> 00:14:14,357
He left without a word while I was unconscious.

145
00:14:14,440 --> 00:14:15,552
Why should I miss him?

146
00:14:17,400 --> 00:14:18,437
You can write him a letter.

147
00:14:18,520 --> 00:14:19,592
Just send it to Taiyi Mountain.

148
00:14:19,960 --> 00:14:21,076
If he receives your letter,

149
00:14:21,159 --> 00:14:22,232
he will definitely reply to you.

150
00:14:23,559 --> 00:14:24,873
I already wrote one.

151
00:15:34,520 --> 00:15:35,520
Chang Yue,

152
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:37,273
where are you?

153
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:40,672
If you don't show up now,

154
00:15:41,840 --> 00:15:44,513
I'm going to throw away this stupid thing you left me.

155
00:16:07,599 --> 00:16:08,599
It's here.

156
00:16:11,640 --> 00:16:13,912
(Inside the Soul-Burning Pool are countless demon souls.)

157
00:16:14,400 --> 00:16:15,953
They feed on blood marrow

158
00:16:16,159 --> 00:16:17,433
and have been starving for a century.

159
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:19,273
To get the Posuo Leaf,

160
00:16:19,840 --> 00:16:22,912
you must feed those demon souls with your body.

161
00:16:24,559 --> 00:16:25,712
This is a thousand times

162
00:16:26,400 --> 00:16:28,393
more painful than the Heart-Piercing Arrow.

163
00:18:43,199 --> 00:18:44,199
Chang Yue,

164
00:18:44,520 --> 00:18:46,036
don't ever

165
00:18:46,119 --> 00:18:47,352
appear before me again.

166
00:19:34,800 --> 00:19:36,797
Grandmother, hurry and think of something.

167
00:19:36,880 --> 00:19:38,712
If this continues, His Highness is going to die.

168
00:19:38,880 --> 00:19:39,880
Grandmother!

169
00:19:40,880 --> 00:19:42,393
If he dies in there,

170
00:19:43,199 --> 00:19:44,393
he brought it upon himself.

171
00:19:45,812 --> 00:19:46,812
I

172
00:19:48,079 --> 00:19:49,873
will never shed a tear for him.

173
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:49,000
Found it.

174
00:20:51,079 --> 00:20:52,079
Found it.

175
00:21:00,040 --> 00:21:01,040
His Highness is out.

176
00:21:01,800 --> 00:21:02,800
Your Highness!

177
00:21:11,160 --> 00:21:13,513
The universe may not age, but love is harder to sever.

178
00:21:14,079 --> 00:21:15,712
Two loving souls are like intertwined silk,

179
00:21:16,280 --> 00:21:17,952
bound by thousands of knots.

180
00:21:18,439 --> 00:21:20,756
To see Chang Yue this devoted and lovesick...

181
00:21:20,839 --> 00:21:21,839
Chang Yue.

182
00:21:21,959 --> 00:21:22,959
Qi Yuan Bao,

183
00:21:23,719 --> 00:21:25,033
what virtues do you possess?

184
00:21:25,839 --> 00:21:27,153
Grandmother,

185
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:29,232
I am back.

186
00:21:34,400 --> 00:21:36,120
- Chang Yue!   - Your Highness!

187
00:21:37,625 --> 00:21:38,332
Found it.

188
00:21:39,824 --> 00:21:42,268
- Yuan Bao!   - Yuan Bao!

189
00:21:42,293 --> 00:21:43,455
- Yuan Bao!   - Yuan Bao!

190
00:21:43,959 --> 00:21:45,669
- Yuan Bao.   - What are you doing down there?

191
00:21:46,479 --> 00:21:47,519
- Come up.   - Here.

192
00:21:47,599 --> 00:21:48,599
Pull er up.

193
00:21:48,684 --> 00:21:50,439
- Grab on.   - Yuan Bao, grab on.

194
00:21:50,599 --> 00:21:52,199
- Come.   - Here, give me your hand.

195
00:21:53,400 --> 00:21:54,400
Careful.

196
00:21:56,079 --> 00:21:57,312
Yuan Bao, are you okay?

197
00:21:57,599 --> 00:21:58,599
Are you okay, Yuan Bao?

198
00:21:58,760 --> 00:21:59,832
- I found it.   - Let's go.

199
00:22:00,079 --> 00:22:01,159
- Let's go.   - Get changed now.

200
00:22:01,239 --> 00:22:02,659
Don't catch a cold. Quick.

201
00:22:09,400 --> 00:22:10,400
Chang Yue.

202
00:22:13,920 --> 00:22:14,920
Chang Yue.

203
00:22:17,080 --> 00:22:18,312
Chang Yue!

204
00:22:33,199 --> 00:22:34,199
Grandmother,

205
00:22:34,422 --> 00:22:36,189
His Highness looks to be in pretty bad shape.

206
00:22:36,272 --> 00:22:37,272
Will he be all right?

207
00:22:41,539 --> 00:22:42,539
From now on,

208
00:22:43,380 --> 00:22:44,691
he will have to endure the torment

209
00:22:44,774 --> 00:22:46,248
of the Heart-Piercing Arrow every night.

210
00:22:46,495 --> 00:22:48,873
Isn't there any other way to alleviate His Highness's pain?

211
00:22:52,719 --> 00:22:54,312
Oh, Qi Yuan Bao.

212
00:22:54,814 --> 00:22:56,592
You're killing His Highness now.

213
00:23:17,160 --> 00:23:18,352
Why am I writing his name?

214
00:23:19,100 --> 00:23:20,100
Stupid Chang Yue.

215
00:23:20,658 --> 00:23:22,317
Don't come again.

216
00:23:22,400 --> 00:23:24,239
Don't ever appear before me again.

217
00:23:34,920 --> 00:23:35,920
Yuan Bao.

218
00:23:37,199 --> 00:23:38,199
What are you doing?

219
00:23:41,239 --> 00:23:42,239
Father.

220
00:23:42,599 --> 00:23:43,753
I'm not doing anything.

221
00:23:43,880 --> 00:23:46,352
Just scribbling.

222
00:23:47,599 --> 00:23:49,359
- Let me see.   - Forget it, Father.

223
00:23:49,599 --> 00:23:50,599
It's just gibberish.

224
00:23:50,680 --> 00:23:51,913
Don't look at it.

225
00:23:52,199 --> 00:23:53,356
If you do,

226
00:23:53,439 --> 00:23:55,273
you might get upset again.

227
00:23:56,704 --> 00:23:57,479
Well.

228
00:23:57,760 --> 00:23:59,312
Is staying in your room boring?

229
00:23:59,560 --> 00:24:02,119
Do you want to take a stroll down the mountain?

230
00:24:04,292 --> 00:24:05,365
No, thank you, Father.

231
00:24:05,925 --> 00:24:07,118
I think

232
00:24:07,759 --> 00:24:08,992
staying here

233
00:24:09,439 --> 00:24:10,873
is actually pretty good.

234
00:24:13,959 --> 00:24:14,959
By the way, Father,

235
00:24:15,502 --> 00:24:16,615
do you remember

236
00:24:16,887 --> 00:24:18,352
what you promised me before?

237
00:24:19,392 --> 00:24:20,392
What did I say?

238
00:24:21,579 --> 00:24:22,732
You promised

239
00:24:23,479 --> 00:24:26,273
to teach me how to make Mother's favorite fennel dumplings.

240
00:24:31,119 --> 00:24:32,913
Her favorite fennel dumplings...

241
00:24:33,518 --> 00:24:34,518
How about we

242
00:24:34,598 --> 00:24:36,312
go to Yuying Court to make dumplings later?

243
00:24:39,165 --> 00:24:40,165
Okay.

244
00:24:40,359 --> 00:24:41,359
Then Father,

245
00:24:41,460 --> 00:24:42,460
go first.

246
00:24:42,743 --> 00:24:43,979
I'll tidy up

247
00:24:44,144 --> 00:24:45,144
and come over right away.

248
00:24:47,680 --> 00:24:50,513
Father, go there and prepare the dumpling wrappers.

249
00:24:50,880 --> 00:24:51,952
I'll be right there.

250
00:25:13,680 --> 00:25:17,352
(I suppose I don't have much time left.)

251
00:25:18,299 --> 00:25:22,972
(Yuying Court)

252
00:26:44,079 --> 00:26:45,793
This chamber is exactly the same as before.

253
00:26:46,880 --> 00:26:47,952
It's so clean.

254
00:26:50,239 --> 00:26:51,239
Father,

255
00:26:51,800 --> 00:26:53,352
do you come here often?

256
00:26:54,719 --> 00:26:55,993
Whenever I have time,

257
00:26:57,079 --> 00:26:58,993
I come here to see your mother.

258
00:27:00,640 --> 00:27:02,033
She was a very tidy person.

259
00:27:02,589 --> 00:27:03,753
So whenever I come,

260
00:27:05,040 --> 00:27:06,472
I clean the place.

261
00:27:19,040 --> 00:27:20,040
Yuan Bao,

262
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:24,993
let's go to the kitchen to make dumplings.

263
00:27:30,040 --> 00:27:31,599
- That was a really good lunch.   - Hui.

264
00:27:33,000 --> 00:27:34,119
- What's wrong?   - Do you know?

265
00:27:34,199 --> 00:27:36,000
Yuan Bao and Master are making dumplings together.

266
00:27:36,199 --> 00:27:38,396
Master is teaching Yuan Bao how to make dumplings?

267
00:27:38,479 --> 00:27:40,756
- Yes.   - Master is teaching Yuan Bao how to make dumplings!

268
00:27:40,839 --> 00:27:43,239
Do you know? Yuan Bao and Master are cooking together!

269
00:27:43,319 --> 00:27:44,319
Do you know?

270
00:27:44,439 --> 00:27:46,913
Master is actually teaching Yuan Bao how to cook.

271
00:27:47,079 --> 00:27:48,356
Master is teaching Yuan Bao

272
00:27:48,439 --> 00:27:49,439
how to make dumplings.

273
00:27:49,880 --> 00:27:51,677
What? Who's cooking with whom?

274
00:27:51,760 --> 00:27:53,276
Master and Yuan Bao.

275
00:27:53,359 --> 00:27:55,312
They're making dumplings in Yuying Court.

276
00:27:56,680 --> 00:27:57,964
Which court? Louder.

277
00:27:58,079 --> 00:27:59,364
Yuying Court

278
00:27:59,640 --> 00:28:01,153
Yuying Court

279
00:28:08,959 --> 00:28:10,793
Your face is as dirty as a kitten's.

280
00:28:11,079 --> 00:28:12,079
Is it dirty?

281
00:28:16,992 --> 00:28:17,992
Let me wipe it for you.

282
00:28:23,299 --> 00:28:24,299
It's clean now?

283
00:28:29,853 --> 00:28:31,793
Father, look.

284
00:28:31,873 --> 00:28:32,873
Did I wrap them nicely?

285
00:28:37,273 --> 00:28:38,273
How many do you want to eat?

286
00:28:39,869 --> 00:28:41,413
- I'll eat as many as you make.   - Look.

287
00:28:41,493 --> 00:28:42,566
How did I do?

288
00:28:43,839 --> 00:28:45,156
The dumplings that you made

289
00:28:45,181 --> 00:28:46,356
are both beautiful and delicious.

290
00:28:46,381 --> 00:28:46,958
Right?

291
00:28:47,962 --> 00:28:49,276
I'm not a kitty.

292
00:28:49,301 --> 00:28:51,014
I'm a big tiger.

293
00:28:53,098 --> 00:28:54,098
Here.

294
00:28:56,921 --> 00:28:58,029
Big kitty.

295
00:28:58,375 --> 00:28:59,489
Little kitty.

296
00:28:59,936 --> 00:29:01,370
Give some to your mother. Quick.

297
00:29:07,857 --> 00:29:08,857
Father,

298
00:29:08,936 --> 00:29:09,936
what's wrong?

299
00:29:10,296 --> 00:29:11,716
Nothing. Let's continue.

300
00:29:12,777 --> 00:29:14,329
Let's cook the dumplings!

301
00:29:14,416 --> 00:29:15,570
Let's cook the dumplings!

302
00:29:18,016 --> 00:29:19,657
So? Are they fighting?

303
00:29:19,737 --> 00:29:20,929
Will they burn the kitchen?

304
00:29:21,377 --> 00:29:22,929
Is Yuan Bao getting disciplined?

305
00:29:24,490 --> 00:29:26,565
Discipline? I'll discipline you. Go away!
