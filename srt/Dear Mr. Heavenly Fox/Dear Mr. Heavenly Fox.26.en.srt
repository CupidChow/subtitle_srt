1
00:01:48,744 --> 00:01:54,011
(Dear Mr. Heavenly Fox)

2
00:01:54,092 --> 00:01:57,045
(Episode 26)

3
00:02:01,639 --> 00:02:02,958
Grandmother Bi Xi said

4
00:02:03,326 --> 00:02:04,759
we couldn't leave until we finished picking!

5
00:02:04,877 --> 00:02:06,151
Everyone, hurry up!

6
00:02:06,239 --> 00:02:07,753
Yes, Ling.

7
00:02:10,473 --> 00:02:11,802
What's that?

8
00:02:13,726 --> 00:02:15,722
Thralls. Everybody, run!

9
00:02:18,854 --> 00:02:20,096
Run!

10
00:02:34,039 --> 00:02:35,322
Chang Yue,

11
00:02:35,966 --> 00:02:38,719
are you sure you won't regret this?

12
00:02:39,720 --> 00:02:40,572
Why would I regret it?

13
00:02:42,600 --> 00:02:45,122
Then I'm going to begin now.

14
00:02:48,259 --> 00:02:48,966
Close your eyes first.

15
00:02:53,240 --> 00:02:54,802
Let the other person kiss you.

16
00:02:55,809 --> 00:02:58,729
What gibberish did Hu Bu Lin write here? I don't understand.

17
00:02:58,880 --> 00:02:59,567
What's next?

18
00:03:02,759 --> 00:03:07,042
Next, I'm going to kiss you.

19
00:03:07,291 --> 00:03:08,332
Close your eyes.

20
00:03:18,039 --> 00:03:19,322
Don't open your eyes.

21
00:03:21,541 --> 00:03:24,362
Next, it's...

22
00:03:28,720 --> 00:03:30,082
What is it?

23
00:03:32,846 --> 00:03:34,122
I'm going to

24
00:03:34,960 --> 00:03:36,282
take off my clothes.

25
00:03:38,530 --> 00:03:39,472
Okay.

26
00:03:40,399 --> 00:03:41,225
Be my guest.

27
00:03:48,839 --> 00:03:50,839
(Qi Yuan Bao, for Chang Yue's ascension,)

28
00:03:50,965 --> 00:03:52,202
(you must do it!)

29
00:03:56,839 --> 00:03:57,839
Your Highness!

30
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:00,314
I have bad news. Humans broke through our barrier

31
00:04:00,450 --> 00:04:01,882
and are invading Beiming!

32
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:14,642
Beiming is right ahead.

33
00:04:15,928 --> 00:04:17,282
Let's take a look.

34
00:04:17,542 --> 00:04:18,682
Follow me.

35
00:04:34,113 --> 00:04:35,395
Grandmother Bi Xi!

36
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:40,000
Huo Shu Ya?

37
00:04:40,184 --> 00:04:41,682
Why did he become like this?

38
00:04:42,112 --> 00:04:43,482
What is he doing?

39
00:04:43,632 --> 00:04:46,002
Who the heck is he? How dare he attack someone like me?

40
00:04:50,962 --> 00:04:53,122
Tian? Liu?

41
00:04:53,920 --> 00:04:54,920
Yuan Bao.

42
00:04:55,200 --> 00:04:56,200
They are no longer humans.

43
00:04:56,366 --> 00:04:57,442
But...

44
00:05:09,959 --> 00:05:10,959
Father.

45
00:05:12,002 --> 00:05:13,365
Are you alright?

46
00:05:17,417 --> 00:05:20,162
Since everyone from Qishan Sect is here,

47
00:05:20,720 --> 00:05:22,162
then today,

48
00:05:22,559 --> 00:05:25,322
I'll make sure you all die here!

49
00:05:28,239 --> 00:05:30,482
Huo Shu Ya, stop it! Are you crazy?

50
00:05:30,800 --> 00:05:31,842
Qi Yuan Bao,

51
00:05:32,079 --> 00:05:33,282
it's all your fault.

52
00:05:33,643 --> 00:05:36,082
You've pushed me to this point.

53
00:05:37,056 --> 00:05:38,482
Look around you.

54
00:05:38,680 --> 00:05:40,762
Look at these innocent people.

55
00:05:41,150 --> 00:05:42,922
Look at your seniors.

56
00:05:43,239 --> 00:05:46,922
Ultimately, it's all because of you.

57
00:05:47,279 --> 00:05:49,042
Because of you!

58
00:05:49,440 --> 00:05:50,522
Huo Shu Ya,

59
00:05:50,692 --> 00:05:52,722
you schemed and plotted for this.

60
00:05:53,047 --> 00:05:54,642
What are you trying to achieve?

61
00:05:56,200 --> 00:05:58,882
Aren't you always boasting about being a righteous sect?

62
00:05:59,760 --> 00:06:03,082
The spirit particle sacrificed herself to save the world.

63
00:06:04,359 --> 00:06:06,242
Now, the only one who can save them

64
00:06:08,239 --> 00:06:09,802
is you!

65
00:06:13,799 --> 00:06:14,543
In the end,

66
00:06:15,056 --> 00:06:17,002
you want my power as the spirit particle.

67
00:06:19,085 --> 00:06:19,670
Fine.

68
00:06:20,246 --> 00:06:21,686
You want me to make a sacrifice.

69
00:06:21,767 --> 00:06:22,709
I can do that.

70
00:06:23,198 --> 00:06:24,477
But you must order

71
00:06:24,604 --> 00:06:26,482
these thralls to retreat from the barrier first.

72
00:06:33,959 --> 00:06:35,322
Qi Yuan Bao.

73
00:06:38,399 --> 00:06:40,879
Even now you still don't realize your mistake.

74
00:06:40,982 --> 00:06:42,962
You're still hanging out with this fox demon.

75
00:06:44,962 --> 00:06:48,202
Today, I'll not only take you,

76
00:06:48,519 --> 00:06:51,882
but I'll also make sure Chang Yue vanish from this world.

77
00:06:53,143 --> 00:06:54,522
Charge!

78
00:06:56,064 --> 00:06:57,402
Get in formation!

79
00:07:07,308 --> 00:07:10,082
No, if this continues, everyone will turn into thralls.

80
00:07:10,288 --> 00:07:10,976
Chang Yue.

81
00:08:07,200 --> 00:08:08,482
Chang Yue.

82
00:08:09,559 --> 00:08:11,602
You're no match for me after all.

83
00:08:13,359 --> 00:08:14,482
Is that so?

84
00:08:27,399 --> 00:08:28,722
You...

85
00:08:29,519 --> 00:08:31,109
You dare to play tricks on me?

86
00:08:32,085 --> 00:08:33,282
Chang Yue.

87
00:08:33,415 --> 00:08:35,442
You too are a despicable person.

88
00:08:35,775 --> 00:08:36,929
Dirty tricks are essential in war.

89
00:08:37,127 --> 00:08:38,528
Shouldn't I use some dirty tricks

90
00:08:38,640 --> 00:08:39,962
to deal with a villain like you?

91
00:08:40,080 --> 00:08:41,362
What do you want?

92
00:08:42,327 --> 00:08:43,560
Get them out of the barrier

93
00:08:43,799 --> 00:08:45,082
or I'll kill you!

94
00:08:45,705 --> 00:08:46,732
Kill me?

95
00:08:47,337 --> 00:08:49,802
Fine. Come and kill me if you can.

96
00:08:51,426 --> 00:08:52,312
Take a look.

97
00:08:52,928 --> 00:08:55,322
Many of your fellow cultivators are here.

98
00:08:55,960 --> 00:08:58,032
Many soldiers from the fox clan are here.

99
00:08:58,212 --> 00:08:59,202
If I die,

100
00:08:59,905 --> 00:09:01,693
I'll drag them with me.

101
00:09:01,828 --> 00:09:03,722
I won't be lonely at all.

102
00:09:04,848 --> 00:09:06,722
Fine. All right then.

103
00:09:07,519 --> 00:09:08,470
If I can't kill you,

104
00:09:09,881 --> 00:09:11,562
then you can forget about getting my power.

105
00:09:11,700 --> 00:09:12,531
Yuan Bao!

106
00:09:13,833 --> 00:09:15,227
- Yuan Bao.   - Qi Yuan Bao, wait!

107
00:09:15,365 --> 00:09:16,393
Stop them.

108
00:09:17,241 --> 00:09:17,953
Wait.

109
00:09:19,162 --> 00:09:20,478
Stop them and back off.

110
00:09:20,686 --> 00:09:21,281
Okay.

111
00:09:33,025 --> 00:09:34,307
Qi Yuan Bao,

112
00:09:35,546 --> 00:09:38,522
if you want to save your peers,

113
00:09:39,019 --> 00:09:42,762
then let's meet at the mausoleum in Suiyue Mountain.

114
00:09:57,280 --> 00:09:58,280
Chang Yue,

115
00:09:58,359 --> 00:09:59,562
go repair the barrier

116
00:09:59,719 --> 00:10:02,082
lest these thralls attack when we're not paying attention.

117
00:10:03,159 --> 00:10:04,159
Grandmother Bi Xi,

118
00:10:04,608 --> 00:10:05,608
rest first.

119
00:10:05,719 --> 00:10:07,082
I'll take care of things here.

120
00:10:07,253 --> 00:10:08,562
You started the whole thing.

121
00:10:08,760 --> 00:10:10,322
Don't ever think I'll thank you.

122
00:10:32,072 --> 00:10:33,998
You may rest here.

123
00:10:34,171 --> 00:10:36,362
If you need anything, just let us know.

124
00:10:36,660 --> 00:10:38,441
- Thank Grandmother Bi Xi for me.   - You're welcome.

125
00:10:38,560 --> 00:10:41,122
She said that you were honored guests of Beiming.

126
00:10:41,295 --> 00:10:42,602
We must extend hospitality.

127
00:10:42,723 --> 00:10:44,242
We'll take our leave now.

128
00:10:44,599 --> 00:10:45,599
Thank you.

129
00:10:47,845 --> 00:10:48,845
Sect Leader Qi,

130
00:10:49,021 --> 00:10:50,202
Grandmother Bi Xi sure is

131
00:10:50,281 --> 00:10:52,122
tough on the outside but soft on the inside.

132
00:10:57,500 --> 00:10:59,162
Xue Han Yu, give it back to me!

133
00:11:00,650 --> 00:11:03,002
Stop right there! Give it to me!

134
00:11:03,083 --> 00:11:06,162
Stop. Okay, no more playing around.

135
00:11:06,650 --> 00:11:08,370
Ugh, so much saliva!

136
00:11:08,583 --> 00:11:09,857
Disgusting!

137
00:11:12,520 --> 00:11:13,085
Come back!

138
00:11:22,009 --> 00:11:24,042
(Since I started everything,)

139
00:11:25,953 --> 00:11:27,642
(let me end it.)

140
00:11:44,800 --> 00:11:45,800
Father.

141
00:11:47,745 --> 00:11:49,202
I'm going to get ready

142
00:11:49,330 --> 00:11:50,722
and go to Suiyue Mountain.

143
00:11:55,248 --> 00:11:57,080
I knew you'd do this.

144
00:12:00,590 --> 00:12:01,578
But Yuan Bao,

145
00:12:03,085 --> 00:12:04,252
you cannot go

146
00:12:05,710 --> 00:12:07,322
to Suiyue Mountain.

147
00:12:08,724 --> 00:12:10,202
You are worried

148
00:12:10,602 --> 00:12:13,762
that the Corpse Puppet King will be released because of me.

149
00:12:13,929 --> 00:12:15,482
If he is released,

150
00:12:16,510 --> 00:12:18,266
he will bring disaster to the world,

151
00:12:18,347 --> 00:12:20,442
causing chaos

152
00:12:21,071 --> 00:12:22,642
and misery.

153
00:12:23,467 --> 00:12:25,641
But I remember you once told me

154
00:12:26,712 --> 00:12:28,162
that the only person

155
00:12:28,459 --> 00:12:31,268
who could suppress and seal him forever

156
00:12:32,813 --> 00:12:33,965
was me.

157
00:12:37,193 --> 00:12:39,027
This is not a joke.

158
00:12:39,871 --> 00:12:40,871
Father.

159
00:12:41,431 --> 00:12:43,910
Who would joke about their own life?

160
00:12:46,991 --> 00:12:50,362
Only when I absorb the Corpse Puppet King's demonic energy

161
00:12:50,598 --> 00:12:53,162
that the world can return to peace.

162
00:12:54,293 --> 00:12:56,682
Those thralls can return to normal,

163
00:12:57,069 --> 00:12:58,482
including Xue Han Yu,

164
00:12:58,728 --> 00:13:01,402
Tian, and Liu.

165
00:13:03,710 --> 00:13:07,002
The Corpse Puppet King has immense power.

166
00:13:07,366 --> 00:13:09,282
It's not something you can handle.

167
00:13:14,030 --> 00:13:15,402
If you do this,

168
00:13:17,590 --> 00:13:19,583
you will surely die.

169
00:13:22,311 --> 00:13:24,162
But if sacrificing myself

170
00:13:24,390 --> 00:13:26,002
can bring peace to the world

171
00:13:26,212 --> 00:13:28,082
and seal the Corpse Puppet King forever,

172
00:13:28,733 --> 00:13:31,686
then my death is worth it.

173
00:13:36,691 --> 00:13:38,962
But I don't want to lose you!

174
00:13:47,259 --> 00:13:48,511
Father,

175
00:13:48,950 --> 00:13:50,442
I am your daughter,

176
00:13:52,173 --> 00:13:54,282
but I am also a disciple of Qishan Sect.

177
00:14:18,772 --> 00:14:20,264
I heard from Hu Bu Lin

178
00:14:20,363 --> 00:14:22,556
that you had found a way to extract the soul.

179
00:14:23,671 --> 00:14:24,671
Yes.

180
00:14:25,850 --> 00:14:26,850
That's good.

181
00:14:28,584 --> 00:14:30,243
You saw what happened today.

182
00:14:30,524 --> 00:14:32,682
The barrier is already vulnerable.

183
00:14:32,892 --> 00:14:35,282
Although we repaired the barrier today,

184
00:14:35,509 --> 00:14:37,802
it will only last for three days at most.

185
00:14:38,396 --> 00:14:40,230
So within three days,

186
00:14:40,413 --> 00:14:42,202
you must complete your ascension.

187
00:14:44,390 --> 00:14:45,276
Duly noted.

188
00:14:50,259 --> 00:14:51,842
Ascending is a good thing.

189
00:14:52,046 --> 00:14:54,242
Why do you look so worried?

190
00:14:59,871 --> 00:15:01,424
You're worried that Qi Yuan Bao

191
00:15:01,671 --> 00:15:02,950
would sacrifice herself

192
00:15:03,030 --> 00:15:04,744
for the innocent people and her peers.

193
00:15:08,350 --> 00:15:10,310
If she truly has

194
00:15:10,390 --> 00:15:11,664
such courage and righteousness,

195
00:15:13,128 --> 00:15:14,424
she will earn my respect.

196
00:16:25,350 --> 00:16:26,350
I won't let you go there.

197
00:16:28,510 --> 00:16:29,510
Chang Yue,

198
00:16:30,231 --> 00:16:31,231
let me go there.

199
00:16:32,270 --> 00:16:33,864
This is my responsibility.

200
00:16:50,551 --> 00:16:51,551
If it were you,

201
00:16:53,111 --> 00:16:54,703
you would do the same.

202
00:17:03,431 --> 00:17:04,542
I won't let you go there.

203
00:17:42,471 --> 00:17:43,471
His Highness has ascended!

204
00:17:43,551 --> 00:17:44,551
Look!

205
00:17:44,711 --> 00:17:46,790
- Hooray!   - His Highness has ascended!

206
00:17:46,870 --> 00:17:47,870
Your Highness!

207
00:17:47,951 --> 00:17:49,743
Grandmother Bi Xi, come take a look.

208
00:17:50,230 --> 00:17:51,503
The birth of a heavenly fox.

209
00:17:51,990 --> 00:17:54,103
His Highness... His Highness has finally ascended!

210
00:18:06,604 --> 00:18:07,717
What is happening?

211
00:18:08,110 --> 00:18:09,910
Yes!

212
00:18:09,990 --> 00:18:10,990
His Highness ascended!

213
00:18:11,030 --> 00:18:12,030
Your Highness!

214
00:18:12,150 --> 00:18:13,584
His Highness ascended!

215
00:18:14,030 --> 00:18:15,263
Finally!

216
00:18:15,791 --> 00:18:16,791
Beiming

217
00:18:17,191 --> 00:18:18,623
has been waiting for this day.

218
00:18:19,510 --> 00:18:20,743
In the end, he has not failed

219
00:18:21,671 --> 00:18:23,903
our clan.

220
00:18:31,750 --> 00:18:33,103
It's quite spectacular.

221
00:18:33,711 --> 00:18:36,230
I have lived for thousands of years, and this is my first time seeing it.

222
00:18:38,791 --> 00:18:40,903
Yi Xuan, do you know what this is?

223
00:18:43,791 --> 00:18:44,791
Yi Xuan?

224
00:18:55,452 --> 00:18:57,704
It is an auspicious sign.

225
00:19:10,870 --> 00:19:12,190
Your Highness!

226
00:19:12,270 --> 00:19:14,944
- Hooray!   - Your Highness!

227
00:20:22,325 --> 00:20:23,446
Here he is.

228
00:20:23,471 --> 00:20:24,471
The spirit particle is here.

229
00:20:33,510 --> 00:20:34,510
He sits there

230
00:20:34,791 --> 00:20:36,070
without moving.

231
00:20:36,150 --> 00:20:37,263
He doesn't even smile.

232
00:20:37,510 --> 00:20:40,150
Don't you know? The spirit particle is the reincarnation of the Sacred One.

233
00:20:40,230 --> 00:20:42,311
He practices the Wordless Mantra and asceticism.

234
00:20:42,391 --> 00:20:43,550
When he turns twenty,

235
00:20:43,630 --> 00:20:45,591
he will be sacrificed to the heavens to save us.

236
00:20:46,110 --> 00:20:47,784
Isn't he twenty years old this year?

237
00:20:48,110 --> 00:20:49,110
Doesn't that mean

238
00:20:49,351 --> 00:20:50,584
he will soon be sacrificed?

239
00:20:52,110 --> 00:20:54,223
Do you think the spirit particle is a real or fake person?

240
00:20:54,591 --> 00:20:55,591
I don't know.

241
00:20:55,891 --> 00:20:57,871
Young Lady, this is the mortal realm.

242
00:20:57,951 --> 00:20:59,143
Let's not cause trouble.

243
00:21:00,191 --> 00:21:02,424
Let me test him.

244
00:21:04,150 --> 00:21:05,150
Young Lady!

245
00:21:20,351 --> 00:21:22,111
It turns out he's a puppet.

246
00:21:22,191 --> 00:21:23,550
Young Lady, stop fooling around.

247
00:21:23,630 --> 00:21:25,263
It's grim if someone finds out.

248
00:21:37,630 --> 00:21:38,630
He can move.

249
00:21:38,951 --> 00:21:39,951
He's a real person.

250
00:22:12,476 --> 00:22:13,476
Spirit particle,

251
00:22:14,204 --> 00:22:16,037
why do you like reading so much?

252
00:22:25,060 --> 00:22:26,060
Spirit particle,

253
00:22:26,228 --> 00:22:27,845
you only eat vegetables and tofu every day.

254
00:22:27,870 --> 00:22:29,014
Don't you get sick of it?

255
00:22:36,711 --> 00:22:37,711
Spirit particle,

256
00:22:37,910 --> 00:22:39,983
you read all day long.

257
00:22:40,390 --> 00:22:41,584
Don't you ever get bored?

258
00:22:43,304 --> 00:22:44,304
Spirit particle,

259
00:22:44,535 --> 00:22:45,931
I've never heard you speak.

260
00:22:46,011 --> 00:22:47,323
Are you mute?

261
00:22:48,897 --> 00:22:49,897
Spirit particle,

262
00:22:50,070 --> 00:22:51,111
why didn't you let me in

263
00:22:51,191 --> 00:22:52,304
when you were bathing just now?

264
00:22:53,030 --> 00:22:53,865
Impertinent beast.

265
00:22:54,576 --> 00:22:55,424
Silence.

266
00:22:55,671 --> 00:22:57,144
So you're not mute.

267
00:22:59,236 --> 00:23:00,236
Oh, I haven't even told you.

268
00:23:00,589 --> 00:23:01,662
My name is Bi Chuan,

269
00:23:01,802 --> 00:23:02,802
not impertinent beast.

270
00:23:03,337 --> 00:23:04,771
Remember my name.

271
00:23:15,057 --> 00:23:16,057
Spirit particle.

272
00:24:07,457 --> 00:24:09,857
Young Lady, we've stayed in the mortal realm for too long.

273
00:24:09,937 --> 00:24:11,131
It's time to return to Beiming.

274
00:24:12,404 --> 00:24:13,877
We can't go back yet.

275
00:24:14,498 --> 00:24:15,498
Why?

276
00:24:16,349 --> 00:24:19,022
Because I've fallen in love with someone,

277
00:24:19,697 --> 00:24:21,050
but he hasn't fallen in love with me.

278
00:24:21,337 --> 00:24:23,251
However, one day, he will love me.

279
00:24:23,417 --> 00:24:25,410
He will love me to death.

280
00:24:38,477 --> 00:24:39,477
I see.

281
00:24:41,498 --> 00:24:43,731
In our past life, we met and were in love.

282
00:24:45,197 --> 00:24:46,065
Yuan Bao.

283
00:25:10,272 --> 00:25:11,818
Spirit particle, it's going to rain soon.

284
00:25:11,898 --> 00:25:12,898
Let's go back.

285
00:25:40,457 --> 00:25:41,457
Spirit particle,

286
00:25:41,577 --> 00:25:43,017
I will always be here forever

287
00:25:43,097 --> 00:25:44,410
to shelter you from the storm.

288
00:26:09,138 --> 00:26:11,337
Spirit particle, one day, you will fall in love with me.

289
00:26:11,417 --> 00:26:13,058
You will love me to death.

290
00:26:13,138 --> 00:26:14,778
When that day comes, I will marry you.

291
00:26:24,417 --> 00:26:25,177
Spirit particle.

292
00:26:26,658 --> 00:26:27,337
Spirit particle.

293
00:26:34,491 --> 00:26:35,105
Spirit particle,

294
00:26:36,198 --> 00:26:37,203
what can I do

295
00:26:37,850 --> 00:26:39,683
so that you won't be sacrificed at Suiyue Mountain?

296
00:26:54,057 --> 00:26:55,057
What if...

297
00:26:55,618 --> 00:26:56,971
What if Suiyue Mountain is gone?

298
00:26:59,217 --> 00:27:00,971
There won't be a sacrificial formation.

299
00:27:02,697 --> 00:27:03,697
What are you going to do?

300
00:27:14,538 --> 00:27:15,538
Bi Chuan?

301
00:27:22,577 --> 00:27:24,531
(I shall ram into Suiyue Mountain then.)

302
00:27:31,457 --> 00:27:32,457
Bi Chuan!

303
00:28:10,778 --> 00:28:12,450
Suiyue Mountain is no more.

304
00:28:14,130 --> 00:28:15,130
You won't have to

305
00:28:16,623 --> 00:28:18,457
die anymore.

306
00:28:34,591 --> 00:28:35,983
Oh, spirit particle.

307
00:28:38,078 --> 00:28:40,551
I love you to death.

308
00:28:45,070 --> 00:28:46,344
But you never

309
00:28:49,757 --> 00:28:52,230
love me back.

310
00:29:07,297 --> 00:29:08,771
You little rascal.

311
00:29:11,110 --> 00:29:11,905
Why...

312
00:29:14,996 --> 00:29:16,310
Why couldn't you wait a little longer?

313
00:30:08,037 --> 00:30:09,037
In the next life,

314
00:30:12,018 --> 00:30:13,771
let me be a fox,

315
00:30:15,491 --> 00:30:18,163
to find you, to love you,

316
00:30:20,137 --> 00:30:21,137
to love you

317
00:30:30,417 --> 00:30:31,930
to death.

318
00:30:43,937 --> 00:30:44,937
Yuan Bao,

319
00:30:45,756 --> 00:30:47,155
in this life,

320
00:30:48,658 --> 00:30:50,290
we must stay together.
