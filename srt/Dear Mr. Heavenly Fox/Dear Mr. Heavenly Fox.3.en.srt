1
00:01:48,882 --> 00:01:54,012
(Dear Mr. Heavenly Fox)

2
00:01:54,059 --> 00:01:56,986
(Episode 3)

3
00:01:58,760 --> 00:02:00,952
Sir, Qi Lian is on high alert.

4
00:02:01,120 --> 00:02:02,272
He has already deployed his men

5
00:02:02,480 --> 00:02:04,393
and kept Qi Yuan Bao at Jingsi Cliff.

6
00:02:04,800 --> 00:02:05,917
Approaching Qi Yuan Bao

7
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:07,073
won't be that easy.

8
00:02:10,240 --> 00:02:11,797
He's so handsome.

9
00:02:11,822 --> 00:02:12,822
Right?

10
00:02:14,520 --> 00:02:17,362
I heard Sect Leader Qi hired him as a new tutor for Qi Yuan Bao.

11
00:02:17,759 --> 00:02:20,036
It is said that he is the disciple of Immortal Tai Yi.

12
00:02:20,166 --> 00:02:21,689
- Really?   - What are you looking at?

13
00:02:24,403 --> 00:02:26,484
- Look, he's coming over here.   - He's coming.

14
00:02:26,812 --> 00:02:28,642
Shen Shen.

15
00:02:28,946 --> 00:02:30,282
It's him.

16
00:02:32,352 --> 00:02:34,479
Mister, what are you doing here?

17
00:02:35,347 --> 00:02:36,602
Mister.

18
00:02:40,520 --> 00:02:42,762
He is so arrogant.

19
00:02:44,160 --> 00:02:45,160
Perhaps...

20
00:02:45,559 --> 00:02:46,917
Perhaps he has something on his mind

21
00:02:47,242 --> 00:02:48,675
and didn't hear me.

22
00:02:49,600 --> 00:02:50,956
Mister.

23
00:02:51,039 --> 00:02:52,882
- Where are you going?   - Follow him.

24
00:02:57,559 --> 00:02:59,642
You know Yuan Bao's tutor?

25
00:03:00,320 --> 00:03:01,593
Not just us.

26
00:03:01,791 --> 00:03:02,791
You know him too.

27
00:03:02,919 --> 00:03:04,476
He was the one carrying

28
00:03:04,577 --> 00:03:06,756
Qi Yuan Bao that day at the inn.

29
00:03:06,839 --> 00:03:09,347
I'm sure Qi Yuan Bao asked him to be her tutor

30
00:03:09,428 --> 00:03:11,153
for her selfish desire.

31
00:03:11,240 --> 00:03:12,596
She's just after his looks.

32
00:03:12,726 --> 00:03:13,352
Second Young Lady Su.

33
00:03:14,240 --> 00:03:15,772
You're also from a prominent cultivation family.

34
00:03:16,479 --> 00:03:17,798
Has no one ever told you

35
00:03:18,240 --> 00:03:20,433
not to gossip about others behind their backs?

36
00:03:24,559 --> 00:03:27,032
I'm not gossiping. I'm just stating the facts.

37
00:03:27,279 --> 00:03:29,600
Besides, I'm not talking behind anyone's back.

38
00:03:29,681 --> 00:03:31,247
I'm just saying it in front of everyone.

39
00:03:31,328 --> 00:03:32,254
Enough.

40
00:03:32,720 --> 00:03:33,912
He's already gone.

41
00:03:54,231 --> 00:03:55,432
That jerk.

42
00:03:55,537 --> 00:03:57,002
Stupid. Idiot.

43
00:03:57,132 --> 00:03:58,842
I'm not done with him!

44
00:04:07,282 --> 00:04:09,882
(Chang Yue)

45
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:14,353
It seems like this new tutor

46
00:04:14,559 --> 00:04:15,559
isn't to your liking.

47
00:04:15,662 --> 00:04:16,802
It's more than that.

48
00:04:16,966 --> 00:04:18,519
I absolutely loathe him.

49
00:04:19,160 --> 00:04:21,193
Not only did he torture me in class,

50
00:04:21,512 --> 00:04:22,709
he continues to torture me after.

51
00:04:22,790 --> 00:04:24,442
He makes me copy this and that.

52
00:04:24,582 --> 00:04:26,375
Now my back aches.

53
00:04:26,640 --> 00:04:27,792
All thanks to him.

54
00:04:29,974 --> 00:04:31,762
That sounds pretty rough.

55
00:04:32,480 --> 00:04:33,130
How about this?

56
00:04:33,953 --> 00:04:34,624
Let me help you.

57
00:04:36,640 --> 00:04:38,633
You're the best, Shu Ya.

58
00:04:38,945 --> 00:04:39,586
Then...

59
00:04:40,600 --> 00:04:43,072
I'll leave these to you.

60
00:04:47,519 --> 00:04:48,519
Here.

61
00:04:49,920 --> 00:04:50,920
Write properly.

62
00:04:51,015 --> 00:04:52,697
Even you won't help me?

63
00:04:55,959 --> 00:04:57,242
This way, sir.

64
00:04:58,239 --> 00:04:59,593
You can stay here for the time being.

65
00:04:59,839 --> 00:05:01,919
If you need anything, please let me know.

66
00:05:02,070 --> 00:05:03,070
Thank you.

67
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:05,000
See you.

68
00:05:07,920 --> 00:05:10,153
Your Highness, how did it go?

69
00:05:10,959 --> 00:05:11,959
Very smoothly.

70
00:05:12,160 --> 00:05:13,282
Really?

71
00:05:13,519 --> 00:05:14,753
I find that hard to believe.

72
00:05:14,912 --> 00:05:15,950
Your Highness, in that case,

73
00:05:16,041 --> 00:05:18,436
let's take advantage of that and kiss Qi Yuan Bao tonight to complete

74
00:05:18,542 --> 00:05:19,542
your in-tandem cultivation.

75
00:05:26,040 --> 00:05:27,040
Here.

76
00:05:35,055 --> 00:05:36,328
Judging by your expression,

77
00:05:36,600 --> 00:05:39,313
I'd say things are going very smoothly on His Highness's side.

78
00:05:39,880 --> 00:05:41,242
This little thing

79
00:05:41,440 --> 00:05:43,237
is getting plumper.

80
00:05:43,359 --> 00:05:44,752
Thanks to your careful care, Aunt.

81
00:05:44,920 --> 00:05:46,202
It's very lucky.

82
00:05:46,335 --> 00:05:48,248
The time has come

83
00:05:48,639 --> 00:05:50,322
to slaughter it.

84
00:05:50,760 --> 00:05:51,760
(Qi Lian.)

85
00:05:52,040 --> 00:05:54,122
(I've been waiting for this day for a long time.)

86
00:06:40,525 --> 00:06:41,958
Your Highness, you assume your true form?

87
00:06:42,167 --> 00:06:44,559
Right. It's more convenient.

88
00:06:44,752 --> 00:06:46,402
Your Highness, please take care.

89
00:07:07,920 --> 00:07:11,122
This is the Evil-cleansing Formation left by Xue Yu Ying.

90
00:07:11,320 --> 00:07:13,482
Her spiritual power is indeed strong.

91
00:07:32,799 --> 00:07:34,202
An evil spirit has broken in!

92
00:07:34,752 --> 00:07:35,652
There!

93
00:07:36,985 --> 00:07:37,611
Quick!

94
00:07:40,391 --> 00:07:41,391
Wait.

95
00:07:41,519 --> 00:07:43,321
It's late now. What's going on?

96
00:07:43,441 --> 00:07:44,922
A demon broke into Jingsi Cliff.

97
00:08:12,657 --> 00:08:15,810
Who dares to challenge me?

98
00:08:21,920 --> 00:08:22,920
Qi Yuan Bao.

99
00:08:23,021 --> 00:08:24,095
Is that all you've got?

100
00:08:24,239 --> 00:08:25,316
If you don't want to die,

101
00:08:25,492 --> 00:08:27,202
then show me what you're really made of.

102
00:08:27,445 --> 00:08:29,522
I can defeat a rookie like you easily.

103
00:08:45,386 --> 00:08:46,477
- Mr. Qi!   - I'm fine.

104
00:08:46,598 --> 00:08:48,562
Help! Someone, help!

105
00:08:49,599 --> 00:08:51,313
So you're the red herring.

106
00:08:51,463 --> 00:08:53,562
Mr. Qi, I can handle this. Go check on Yuan Bao!

107
00:08:53,760 --> 00:08:54,377
Shu Ya!

108
00:09:30,799 --> 00:09:31,799
Get up!

109
00:09:32,225 --> 00:09:34,073
Aren't you the heiress of a family of cultivators?

110
00:09:34,239 --> 00:09:35,602
Are you so easily beaten?

111
00:10:20,908 --> 00:10:22,811
Qi Yuan Bao, this is not the end of me.

112
00:10:27,318 --> 00:10:28,641
Did that guy

113
00:10:29,479 --> 00:10:31,227
come to test my spirit root?

114
00:10:52,595 --> 00:10:53,595
Little fox.

115
00:10:53,733 --> 00:10:55,286
Thank you for earlier.

116
00:10:55,442 --> 00:10:56,722
Are you hurt?

117
00:10:59,080 --> 00:11:00,080
Yuan Bao.

118
00:11:03,119 --> 00:11:04,119
Crap.

119
00:11:04,200 --> 00:11:05,322
My father...

120
00:11:05,960 --> 00:11:08,232
Oh, no. My father hates foxes the most.

121
00:11:08,505 --> 00:11:09,716
If he finds out,

122
00:11:09,853 --> 00:11:11,487
he'll cook you alive.

123
00:11:20,766 --> 00:11:22,118
Yuan Bao.

124
00:11:22,599 --> 00:11:23,281
Are you okay?

125
00:11:23,381 --> 00:11:25,117
Father, I'm fine. I'm taking a bath.

126
00:11:25,142 --> 00:11:26,121
I'm indecent.

127
00:11:26,719 --> 00:11:27,697
I just want to check

128
00:11:28,119 --> 00:11:29,602
if you're hurt by the thief.

129
00:11:29,840 --> 00:11:31,000
- Are you injured?   - I...

130
00:11:31,213 --> 00:11:33,242
Father, I'm not hurt. That thief couldn't hurt me.

131
00:11:33,572 --> 00:11:35,489
Also, I stabbed the thief in the arm.

132
00:11:35,533 --> 00:11:36,533
You should go after him!

133
00:11:36,719 --> 00:11:38,476
Yuan Bao, I know you're indecent,

134
00:11:38,605 --> 00:11:39,718
but I am worried.

135
00:11:39,880 --> 00:11:41,712
I'll let Xiao Hui come in and take a look.

136
00:11:56,840 --> 00:11:58,592
Yuan Bao, are you okay?

137
00:11:58,880 --> 00:12:00,712
I'm fine. I'm perfectly fine, aren't I?

138
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:26,802
(The key to completing in-tandem cultivation is the kiss of true love.)

139
00:12:27,359 --> 00:12:32,522
(Your Highness, what you need to do tonight is to kiss her.)

140
00:12:46,440 --> 00:12:48,082
We're glad that you're safe.

141
00:12:48,440 --> 00:12:49,757
- I am.   - I'll head out then.

142
00:12:49,886 --> 00:12:51,202
Goodbye, Hui.

143
00:13:12,612 --> 00:13:13,612
Sir.

144
00:13:14,599 --> 00:13:15,599
Did you catch the thief?

145
00:13:15,681 --> 00:13:17,319
Did you see what sect he's from

146
00:13:17,431 --> 00:13:18,682
or what kind of demon he is?

147
00:13:18,880 --> 00:13:19,880
No.

148
00:13:21,342 --> 00:13:25,495
He can't possibly vanish into thin air in our sect.

149
00:13:26,280 --> 00:13:27,280
Search again.

150
00:13:27,438 --> 00:13:28,438
Yes.

151
00:13:37,400 --> 00:13:38,840
Master, what's wrong?

152
00:13:40,119 --> 00:13:42,722
Even though Xue Yu Ying is dead,

153
00:13:42,799 --> 00:13:45,562
she still left behind a powerful Evil-cleansing Formation.

154
00:13:46,520 --> 00:13:47,802
What are we going to do?

155
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:49,797
The Corpse Puppet King should appear soon.

156
00:13:49,880 --> 00:13:51,162
How is it on your end?

157
00:13:51,359 --> 00:13:52,359
Sir,

158
00:13:52,439 --> 00:13:54,873
Qi Yuan Bao has indeed regained her spiritual power.

159
00:13:57,096 --> 00:13:58,322
Little fox.

160
00:13:59,159 --> 00:14:00,159
Little fox.

161
00:14:01,039 --> 00:14:03,112
Little fox.

162
00:14:03,479 --> 00:14:04,479
Yuan Bao.

163
00:14:04,999 --> 00:14:05,999
Yuan Bao.

164
00:14:06,119 --> 00:14:07,479
Are you okay? Are you hurt?

165
00:14:07,574 --> 00:14:08,574
Let me see.

166
00:14:08,857 --> 00:14:09,975
Relax.

167
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:11,273
Aren't I perfectly fine?

168
00:14:11,479 --> 00:14:12,025
Yuan Bao.

169
00:14:12,566 --> 00:14:13,124
Yuan Bao.

170
00:14:13,919 --> 00:14:14,532
Are you okay?

171
00:14:16,400 --> 00:14:17,516
Don't worry, Shu Ya.

172
00:14:17,541 --> 00:14:18,199
I'm fine.

173
00:14:19,799 --> 00:14:20,285
You...

174
00:14:21,640 --> 00:14:22,640
You...

175
00:14:22,960 --> 00:14:24,592
How did you hurt your hand?

176
00:14:24,840 --> 00:14:26,177
It's just a small injury. It's nothing.

177
00:14:26,719 --> 00:14:27,719
I'm just glad you're okay.

178
00:14:33,760 --> 00:14:36,722
(Everyone knows that I severed my spirit root back then.)

179
00:14:37,840 --> 00:14:39,552
(Why would that person come to test me?)

180
00:14:40,400 --> 00:14:41,882
(Who exactly is he?)

181
00:14:42,520 --> 00:14:43,962
(What is his goal?)

182
00:14:44,944 --> 00:14:45,944
Mr. Tian,

183
00:14:46,110 --> 00:14:47,827
my young master is a man of healthy habits.

184
00:14:47,922 --> 00:14:49,838
At this hour, he's already asleep.

185
00:14:49,919 --> 00:14:51,393
He's sleeping soundly right now.

186
00:14:51,559 --> 00:14:54,317
But my Meng Meng is still lying sick in bed.

187
00:14:54,400 --> 00:14:55,400
That's right.

188
00:14:55,719 --> 00:14:58,326
Mr. Tian, the accident with Meng Meng is just a misunderstanding.

189
00:14:58,559 --> 00:15:01,276
Besides, my young master is grumpy when he wakes up.

190
00:15:01,359 --> 00:15:02,802
But I'm even more furious.

191
00:15:03,032 --> 00:15:04,362
Get out of my way.

192
00:15:10,457 --> 00:15:11,642
Tian.

193
00:15:11,905 --> 00:15:12,905
Tian.

194
00:15:13,087 --> 00:15:14,210
Get up.

195
00:15:16,559 --> 00:15:18,522
Mr. Tian, what did I tell you?

196
00:15:18,632 --> 00:15:20,385
My young master is grumpy when he wakes up.

197
00:15:20,597 --> 00:15:21,950
See? You wouldn't listen.

198
00:15:22,119 --> 00:15:23,119
Now you suffer.

199
00:15:23,221 --> 00:15:24,722
Da Yong, let's go.

200
00:15:25,210 --> 00:15:27,326
- Let's go.   - Careful, Tian.

201
00:15:27,479 --> 00:15:28,636
Did you get your injuries checked?

202
00:15:28,719 --> 00:15:29,719
What do you think?

203
00:15:29,900 --> 00:15:32,263
I'm all bruised right now. No need for an examination.

204
00:15:32,429 --> 00:15:33,722
Oh, my junior.

205
00:15:33,880 --> 00:15:35,997
I have sacrificed a lot for you.

206
00:15:36,080 --> 00:15:38,160
- Let's go.   - Your Highness,

207
00:15:38,400 --> 00:15:39,596
your cheek is flushing.

208
00:15:39,679 --> 00:15:40,679
Your breathing is ragged.

209
00:15:40,759 --> 00:15:42,322
You seem distraught.

210
00:15:42,637 --> 00:15:45,349
You look like you just kissed her.

211
00:15:52,719 --> 00:15:54,122
Tell me, Your Highness.

212
00:15:56,039 --> 00:15:57,039
Tell me.

213
00:15:58,989 --> 00:16:00,661
What happened?

214
00:16:02,679 --> 00:16:05,322
It seems that the in-tandem cultivation wasn't successful.

215
00:16:06,440 --> 00:16:08,193
Your Highness, you're in trouble again.

216
00:16:09,528 --> 00:16:10,272
How so?

217
00:16:10,452 --> 00:16:13,646
You see, other than you, someone else is coveting Young Lady Qi too.

218
00:16:13,799 --> 00:16:15,516
We need to hurry up.

219
00:16:15,599 --> 00:16:16,599
Otherwise,

220
00:16:16,694 --> 00:16:18,410
who knows what else might occur?

221
00:16:21,520 --> 00:16:24,636
Sir, I've searched everywhere in the sect.

222
00:16:24,719 --> 00:16:26,282
I didn't find any suspicious people.

223
00:16:26,520 --> 00:16:28,912
I'm afraid the thief is still in our sect.

224
00:16:29,159 --> 00:16:30,159
For now,

225
00:16:31,200 --> 00:16:33,993
we can only increase the patrols around Jingsi Cliff.

226
00:16:49,479 --> 00:16:50,479
Yuan Bao.

227
00:16:50,856 --> 00:16:52,202
Yuan Bao, you're awake.

228
00:16:55,960 --> 00:16:57,202
What's wrong?

229
00:16:58,056 --> 00:17:00,333
Why are there so many people today?

230
00:17:00,440 --> 00:17:02,476
We're surrounded

231
00:17:02,652 --> 00:17:04,082
by more and more guards now.

232
00:17:04,255 --> 00:17:06,049
Not even a fly can come in.

233
00:17:07,144 --> 00:17:08,144
By the way,

234
00:17:08,225 --> 00:17:10,562
after Father searched the whole place,

235
00:17:10,800 --> 00:17:12,356
did he find any suspicious people?

236
00:17:12,439 --> 00:17:13,719
Suspicious people? No.

237
00:17:14,520 --> 00:17:15,793
That's strange.

238
00:17:17,079 --> 00:17:18,913
What about Chang Yue? Did they check on him?

239
00:17:19,160 --> 00:17:20,717
Tian examined Chang Yue's residence.

240
00:17:20,831 --> 00:17:22,263
He didn't find anything unusual.

241
00:17:25,264 --> 00:17:26,322
Yuan Bao,

242
00:17:27,199 --> 00:17:28,592
you must have had a night of fright.

243
00:17:28,719 --> 00:17:29,832
Were you injured?

244
00:17:29,920 --> 00:17:31,802
No. I'm perfectly fine.

245
00:17:32,203 --> 00:17:33,395
Also,

246
00:17:33,839 --> 00:17:36,592
not only was I unscathed,

247
00:17:37,880 --> 00:17:40,153
but I also took a wonderful bath.

248
00:17:43,520 --> 00:17:44,722
Mr. Chang Yue.

249
00:17:52,746 --> 00:17:54,082
Your lecture.

250
00:18:10,479 --> 00:18:12,276
(He is avoiding my gaze.)

251
00:18:12,382 --> 00:18:13,722
(How strange.)

252
00:18:13,920 --> 00:18:15,762
(Could he be the invader from last night?)

253
00:18:17,160 --> 00:18:18,160
The lecture starts now.

254
00:18:21,400 --> 00:18:22,762
Open the second volume.

255
00:18:22,959 --> 00:18:24,112
Today, we'll study Great Learning.

256
00:18:30,680 --> 00:18:31,842
Master,

257
00:18:32,039 --> 00:18:33,482
can I ask you something?

258
00:18:34,800 --> 00:18:35,392
What is it?

259
00:18:36,280 --> 00:18:39,472
Last night, where were you

260
00:18:39,640 --> 00:18:40,654
when I was attacked?

261
00:18:57,640 --> 00:18:58,882
Master?

262
00:19:00,312 --> 00:19:01,882
Why aren't you saying anything?

263
00:19:06,239 --> 00:19:07,682
What do you want me to say?

264
00:19:14,239 --> 00:19:16,042
What about my question earlier?

265
00:19:16,439 --> 00:19:17,922
You still haven't answered me.

266
00:19:18,920 --> 00:19:20,722
It's either you don't want to answer me

267
00:19:21,800 --> 00:19:23,362
or you can't answer me.

268
00:19:24,400 --> 00:19:27,633
Or maybe you're

269
00:19:29,719 --> 00:19:31,712
feeling guilty.

270
00:19:42,705 --> 00:19:43,504
I was taking a bath.

271
00:19:45,719 --> 00:19:46,719
What a coincidence.

272
00:19:46,800 --> 00:19:48,880
- You were also taking a bath?   - Let's continue.

273
00:19:50,040 --> 00:19:51,642
(Does he think I'd believe that?)

274
00:19:58,241 --> 00:19:59,553
(Let me see)

275
00:19:59,800 --> 00:20:01,472
(if he has any injuries on his hands.)

276
00:20:01,719 --> 00:20:02,719
Master,

277
00:20:02,920 --> 00:20:04,673
your sleeves are a bit dirty.

278
00:20:04,960 --> 00:20:06,242
Let me take a look.

279
00:20:10,978 --> 00:20:13,762
Master, you must be thirsty.

280
00:20:14,319 --> 00:20:15,319
Come.

281
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:19,362
Here, Master.

282
00:20:22,577 --> 00:20:24,482
Sit properly. We have a lecture.

283
00:20:29,400 --> 00:20:32,712
(There's no way I can't examine your hands.)

284
00:20:45,880 --> 00:20:47,522
(I'll drench him with water.)

285
00:21:40,479 --> 00:21:42,072
(Since you like water so much,)

286
00:21:42,199 --> 00:21:43,841
(I'll drench you completely.)

287
00:21:52,894 --> 00:21:54,242
Master,

288
00:21:55,239 --> 00:21:56,372
please take this.

289
00:21:58,599 --> 00:22:00,922
This is a perk here in Jingsi Cliff.

290
00:22:01,074 --> 00:22:03,002
Let's go to the hot springs together.

291
00:22:03,359 --> 00:22:04,359
Hot springs?

292
00:22:04,839 --> 00:22:06,718
The other disciples all said yes.

293
00:22:06,832 --> 00:22:08,242
Only you left, Master.

294
00:22:08,671 --> 00:22:09,944
Did I say I would agree to this?

295
00:22:10,160 --> 00:22:11,362
It's such a fun perk.

296
00:22:11,599 --> 00:22:13,762
Surely you wouldn't refuse, would you?

297
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:15,442
I don't like bathing with others.

298
00:22:15,680 --> 00:22:16,802
Master.

299
00:22:16,934 --> 00:22:18,847
I want to go with you.

300
00:22:23,130 --> 00:22:26,042
We'll see.

301
00:22:38,560 --> 00:22:41,682
(This time, I can definitely see his arms.)

302
00:22:41,959 --> 00:22:43,522
(I don't know what her plan is,)

303
00:22:43,742 --> 00:22:45,802
(but this is a good opportunity to complete)

304
00:22:46,039 --> 00:22:47,482
(the in-tandem cultivation.)

305
00:22:49,560 --> 00:22:50,592
(Seriously?)

306
00:22:50,959 --> 00:22:52,513
(Wearing clothes in the hot springs?)

307
00:22:52,680 --> 00:22:54,042
(He can't be that old-fashioned.)

308
00:23:08,225 --> 00:23:10,682
(Just take the last one off.)

309
00:23:12,079 --> 00:23:13,842
(He is doing it on purpose.)

310
00:23:25,698 --> 00:23:27,122
I hear a woman's voice.

311
00:23:27,680 --> 00:23:29,439
Where? Where is it?

312
00:23:31,479 --> 00:23:32,802
I hear a woman's voice.

313
00:23:35,719 --> 00:23:36,802
Where is the pervert?

314
00:23:36,913 --> 00:23:38,669
Let's go. Grab your weapons. Split up and search.

315
00:23:38,750 --> 00:23:39,882
Let's find her.

316
00:23:40,126 --> 00:23:41,282
What the heck?

317
00:23:41,550 --> 00:23:42,583
Pervert!

318
00:23:42,719 --> 00:23:43,842
She should be hanged.

319
00:23:44,079 --> 00:23:45,322
A female pervert.

320
00:23:49,719 --> 00:23:51,642
So this is the perk one can get in your sect?

321
00:23:57,400 --> 00:23:58,400
Pervert.

322
00:23:59,479 --> 00:24:00,842
You should be hanged.

323
00:24:03,839 --> 00:24:05,322
A female pervert.

324
00:24:05,804 --> 00:24:06,804
I'm...

325
00:24:06,885 --> 00:24:08,642
- The sound came from this place.   - Not...

326
00:24:10,119 --> 00:24:11,119
Over there.

327
00:24:11,239 --> 00:24:12,876
- Really?   - The voice came from that place.

328
00:24:13,060 --> 00:24:14,060
Where?

329
00:24:14,400 --> 00:24:15,557
Over there. Let's go.

330
00:24:15,663 --> 00:24:16,663
Over here.

331
00:24:17,400 --> 00:24:18,793
Where is it?

332
00:24:19,479 --> 00:24:20,290
Mr. Chang Yue,

333
00:24:20,680 --> 00:24:22,042
have you seen a woman?

334
00:24:24,280 --> 00:24:25,280
Don't snitch me out.

335
00:24:25,360 --> 00:24:26,642
If my father finds out,

336
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:28,322
he'll kill me.

337
00:24:28,826 --> 00:24:29,826
Please.

338
00:24:31,400 --> 00:24:33,352
Mr. Chang Yue, have you seen a woman?

339
00:24:33,569 --> 00:24:34,696
Mr. Chang Yue?

340
00:24:35,312 --> 00:24:35,995
I saw a woman.

341
00:24:36,719 --> 00:24:38,557
- Shush!   - Where is she?

342
00:24:38,655 --> 00:24:39,967
Where is she?

343
00:24:41,160 --> 00:24:42,522
I'm warning you.

344
00:24:43,560 --> 00:24:45,077
- She went east.   - East?

345
00:24:45,160 --> 00:24:46,437
Okay. Let's give chase.

346
00:24:46,543 --> 00:24:49,282
Mr. Chang Yue, we'll chase after her. Have care.

347
00:24:49,307 --> 00:24:52,251
Someone like you will be the pervert's first target.

348
00:24:54,015 --> 00:24:54,780
Noted with thanks.

349
00:24:58,439 --> 00:25:02,162
You went to great lengths just to see if my arms are hurt or not.

350
00:25:03,583 --> 00:25:04,403
So you knew.

351
00:25:09,526 --> 00:25:10,747
You could have just asked me.

352
00:25:15,194 --> 00:25:16,072
It's not you.

353
00:25:22,542 --> 00:25:24,340
If you knew all along, why didn't you say so earlier?

354
00:25:24,421 --> 00:25:26,261
You just wanted to see me make a fool of myself.

355
00:25:29,719 --> 00:25:31,520
You're a scheming, cunning, annoying jerk!

356
00:25:35,040 --> 00:25:36,040
Slow down.

357
00:25:45,560 --> 00:25:46,913
So you can be scared.

358
00:25:48,040 --> 00:25:50,642
Who says I was scared?

359
00:25:50,783 --> 00:25:53,656
I'm just avoiding trouble.

360
00:25:54,760 --> 00:25:56,122
Is that so?

361
00:25:56,439 --> 00:25:58,192
I hear a noise there. Let's go take a look.

362
00:25:58,490 --> 00:25:59,490
- Let's go.   - Master.

363
00:25:59,600 --> 00:26:01,553
Quick.

364
00:26:03,160 --> 00:26:04,402
This way. Quick.

365
00:26:04,599 --> 00:26:05,599
Hurry up.

366
00:26:10,641 --> 00:26:11,641
Why should I hide?

367
00:26:11,800 --> 00:26:12,800
Are you stupid?

368
00:26:14,319 --> 00:26:15,319
Think about it.

369
00:26:15,400 --> 00:26:16,938
If you go out now, then everyone will know

370
00:26:17,019 --> 00:26:18,573
that you've been defiled by me.

371
00:26:18,760 --> 00:26:20,312
How will you be able to face anyone again?

372
00:26:22,359 --> 00:26:23,393
Master!

373
00:26:42,095 --> 00:26:43,218
Over there.
