1
00:01:48,762 --> 00:01:53,986
(Dear Mr. Heavenly Fox)

2
00:01:54,066 --> 00:01:57,223
(Episode 16)

3
00:02:09,679 --> 00:02:11,482
(Yuan Bao, he's lying to you.)

4
00:02:11,720 --> 00:02:13,002
After he retrieves his soul,

5
00:02:13,321 --> 00:02:14,761
he will eradicate all mortals.

6
00:02:14,808 --> 00:02:16,410
(He never loves you.)

7
00:02:17,046 --> 00:02:17,711
No!

8
00:02:21,180 --> 00:02:21,789
Yuan Bao!

9
00:02:24,352 --> 00:02:24,975
Yuan Bao!

10
00:02:25,919 --> 00:02:27,619
Yuan Bao, are you alright?

11
00:02:31,119 --> 00:02:32,119
Come.

12
00:02:32,399 --> 00:02:33,399
Come.

13
00:02:35,320 --> 00:02:36,320
Drink some medicine.

14
00:02:39,240 --> 00:02:40,240
Are you feeling better?

15
00:02:45,679 --> 00:02:46,679
You're dismissed.

16
00:02:50,240 --> 00:02:51,240
Father.

17
00:02:53,360 --> 00:02:55,392
You know about the soul,

18
00:02:56,399 --> 00:02:57,399
don't you?

19
00:03:00,600 --> 00:03:02,073
I only found out much later.

20
00:03:02,960 --> 00:03:05,112
On the day of the Fox Hunt Festival, you went missing.

21
00:03:05,320 --> 00:03:07,313
I should have known it has something to do with his soul.

22
00:03:08,240 --> 00:03:09,392
It was my fault.

23
00:03:09,800 --> 00:03:10,912
And Chang Yue

24
00:03:11,199 --> 00:03:12,552
took advantage of my oversight.

25
00:03:14,080 --> 00:03:15,112
It's all my fault.

26
00:03:15,839 --> 00:03:17,641
I thought I could protect you.

27
00:03:17,721 --> 00:03:19,713
But in the end,

28
00:03:22,199 --> 00:03:23,793
I hurt you.

29
00:03:24,199 --> 00:03:25,199
Father.

30
00:03:26,720 --> 00:03:27,720
Do you also think

31
00:03:28,279 --> 00:03:29,599
Chang Yue is the kind of person

32
00:03:29,679 --> 00:03:30,713
they say he is?

33
00:03:32,720 --> 00:03:34,353
I also wish he weren't like this.

34
00:03:35,320 --> 00:03:36,320
But...

35
00:03:38,800 --> 00:03:39,800
Yuan Bao,

36
00:03:40,440 --> 00:03:41,672
it's come to this.

37
00:03:42,679 --> 00:03:43,679
You should just

38
00:03:44,399 --> 00:03:46,073
forget about him.

39
00:03:49,080 --> 00:03:50,080
But...

40
00:04:00,559 --> 00:04:01,559
What is this?

41
00:04:01,759 --> 00:04:02,759
Truth Pill.

42
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:05,032
The person who takes it

43
00:04:05,720 --> 00:04:06,759
will tell you the truth

44
00:04:06,839 --> 00:04:08,433
if you ask him any question.

45
00:04:09,759 --> 00:04:10,759
Yuan Bao,

46
00:04:11,479 --> 00:04:12,593
you have to find

47
00:04:14,080 --> 00:04:15,912
some answers yourself.

48
00:04:34,119 --> 00:04:35,193
Mr. Chang Yue, good morning.

49
00:04:35,839 --> 00:04:37,320
It's so early. Is something the matter?

50
00:04:37,400 --> 00:04:38,479
Young Lady Qi

51
00:04:38,559 --> 00:04:39,759
sent a message.

52
00:04:39,839 --> 00:04:41,713
She waits for you at Xiaojing Lake, north of the city.

53
00:04:42,959 --> 00:04:43,959
Thank you.

54
00:04:44,440 --> 00:04:45,993
I shall take my leave.

55
00:05:03,760 --> 00:05:06,112
Su Qian Qian is ruthless.

56
00:05:20,880 --> 00:05:23,313
Isn't this her perfume pouch?

57
00:05:24,679 --> 00:05:26,153
How did it end up with me?

58
00:05:28,040 --> 00:05:29,040
How annoying.

59
00:05:29,079 --> 00:05:30,633
I have to take it to her again.

60
00:05:49,160 --> 00:05:50,160
Su Qian Qian.

61
00:05:50,760 --> 00:05:53,193
- Who is it?   - It's me, Xue Han Yu.

62
00:05:55,519 --> 00:05:56,519
What?

63
00:05:58,119 --> 00:05:59,800
Can you change this habit

64
00:05:59,880 --> 00:06:01,753
of being so forgetful?

65
00:06:03,079 --> 00:06:04,079
Here.

66
00:06:04,640 --> 00:06:06,193
You left it at my place last night.

67
00:06:06,440 --> 00:06:08,440
You seem to care about this thing quite a bit.

68
00:06:08,640 --> 00:06:10,319
I brought it back so you won't cry about it later.

69
00:06:10,399 --> 00:06:11,399
It's annoying.

70
00:06:12,799 --> 00:06:13,832
- Also,   - You...

71
00:06:14,959 --> 00:06:17,633
hitting someone's neck hurts, okay?

72
00:06:17,799 --> 00:06:19,713
Please be gentler next time.

73
00:06:23,600 --> 00:06:24,600
Xue Han Yu!

74
00:06:25,399 --> 00:06:26,952
Where is your brain?

75
00:06:29,679 --> 00:06:30,679
Just die from stupidity.

76
00:06:30,959 --> 00:06:31,959
What did I do now?

77
00:06:33,185 --> 00:06:34,007
You...

78
00:06:38,040 --> 00:06:40,272
Are you for real?

79
00:06:41,959 --> 00:06:42,999
You left something behind,

80
00:06:43,079 --> 00:06:44,633
and I specifically brought it to you.

81
00:06:45,160 --> 00:06:47,319
Instead of thanking me, you yelled at me.

82
00:06:47,399 --> 00:06:49,232
Why does it feel like I'm the one in the wrong?

83
00:06:49,720 --> 00:06:50,720
You're crazy.

84
00:06:50,920 --> 00:06:53,039
Are you sure she left it behind accidentally,

85
00:06:53,119 --> 00:06:54,153
and wasn't giving it to you?

86
00:06:58,160 --> 00:07:00,193
(Why would Qian Qian like an idiot like you?)

87
00:07:01,519 --> 00:07:02,713
Give me a break.

88
00:07:09,760 --> 00:07:10,832
I'm an idiot.

89
00:07:16,359 --> 00:07:17,359
Su Qian Qian.

90
00:07:18,839 --> 00:07:19,839
Qian Qian.

91
00:07:27,320 --> 00:07:28,320
I'm so angry!

92
00:07:29,320 --> 00:07:30,567
Shen Shen, he just...

93
00:07:31,519 --> 00:07:32,960
Are you for real?

94
00:07:33,040 --> 00:07:34,799
You left something behind, and I brought it to you.

95
00:07:35,160 --> 00:07:37,153
Why are you mad? What do you want me to do?

96
00:07:37,920 --> 00:07:39,792
If I didn't have patience, I would have punched you.

97
00:07:41,160 --> 00:07:42,599
Shen Shen, why did you

98
00:07:42,679 --> 00:07:44,112
tell him?

99
00:07:44,279 --> 00:07:45,279
I shouldn't have told him?

100
00:07:46,799 --> 00:07:48,479
I see. I'm going to tell him right now

101
00:07:48,559 --> 00:07:49,559
that it is a misunderstanding.

102
00:07:55,600 --> 00:07:57,033
Don't go.

103
00:07:59,320 --> 00:08:01,160
- Su Qian Qian.   - He's such a stupid man.

104
00:08:01,559 --> 00:08:03,439
I don't even know what you like about him.

105
00:08:03,519 --> 00:08:04,792
Su Qian Qian.

106
00:08:06,959 --> 00:08:07,959
Good luck.

107
00:08:10,320 --> 00:08:13,473
The beautiful and generous Su Qian Qian.

108
00:08:13,880 --> 00:08:14,880
Qian Qian,

109
00:08:15,119 --> 00:08:16,272
let's come out and talk.

110
00:08:22,079 --> 00:08:23,079
Su Qian Qian,

111
00:08:23,519 --> 00:08:25,593
being so petty isn't like you.

112
00:08:26,399 --> 00:08:27,552
The perfume pouch is innocent.

113
00:08:28,160 --> 00:08:30,792
Why don't you throw the sachet out first and then we'll talk?

114
00:08:36,440 --> 00:08:37,953
Xue Han Yu, don't go too far!

115
00:08:40,773 --> 00:08:42,520
Come back here! Xue Han Yu!

116
00:08:42,979 --> 00:08:44,520
- Give it back!   - No, I won't.

117
00:08:44,600 --> 00:08:45,680
- Give it back!   - Come.

118
00:08:45,760 --> 00:08:47,253
I just won't give it back.

119
00:08:47,760 --> 00:08:49,300
- Give it back!   - You already gave it to me,

120
00:08:49,479 --> 00:08:50,922
so naturally, I'll keep it.

121
00:08:51,400 --> 00:08:52,762
I didn't give it to you.

122
00:09:00,479 --> 00:09:01,712
It smells so good.

123
00:09:03,039 --> 00:09:05,112
Isn't this a little bit too much for me?

124
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:09,000
You don't like it?

125
00:09:10,159 --> 00:09:12,039
Give it back to me then. I'll give it to someone else.

126
00:09:12,239 --> 00:09:13,239
Who says I don't like it?

127
00:09:13,640 --> 00:09:14,640
I like it a lot.

128
00:09:30,440 --> 00:09:31,440
(Yuan Bao.)

129
00:09:32,080 --> 00:09:33,152
(You have to find)

130
00:09:34,119 --> 00:09:36,112
(some answers yourself.)

131
00:09:49,159 --> 00:09:50,159
Yuan Bao.

132
00:10:04,919 --> 00:10:05,919
Yuan Bao.

133
00:10:06,880 --> 00:10:07,912
Did you sleep well last night?

134
00:10:12,585 --> 00:10:13,938
I had nightmares all night.

135
00:10:14,799 --> 00:10:15,799
Nightmares?

136
00:10:18,080 --> 00:10:19,080
In my dream,

137
00:10:20,119 --> 00:10:21,433
there was a strange,

138
00:10:22,880 --> 00:10:23,645
different,

139
00:10:25,039 --> 00:10:27,073
Chang Yue that I've never seen before.

140
00:10:27,400 --> 00:10:28,513
Why would you dream of that?

141
00:10:37,640 --> 00:10:38,993
Are you willing to take this?

142
00:11:04,919 --> 00:11:06,840
Won't you even ask me what it is?

143
00:11:07,200 --> 00:11:08,525
What if it's a poison?

144
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:11,273
You ask me to take it.

145
00:11:11,840 --> 00:11:12,840
I won't ask any questions.

146
00:11:28,479 --> 00:11:29,479
Chang Yue,

147
00:11:33,640 --> 00:11:34,753
I have something to ask you.

148
00:11:35,719 --> 00:11:37,112
Just answer truthfully.

149
00:11:37,880 --> 00:11:39,152
I will never deceive you.

150
00:11:40,840 --> 00:11:41,840
You

151
00:11:42,919 --> 00:11:44,993
are the future heavenly fox of the fox clan.

152
00:11:47,400 --> 00:11:48,400
Yes.

153
00:11:50,559 --> 00:11:52,112
The reason you approached me

154
00:11:53,080 --> 00:11:55,313
is to complete the in-tandem cultivation

155
00:11:56,320 --> 00:11:58,152
and retrieve your soul from my body.

156
00:11:58,920 --> 00:11:59,558
Yes.

157
00:12:01,320 --> 00:12:02,953
You became my tutor,

158
00:12:03,760 --> 00:12:05,672
care for me, and protect me

159
00:12:07,440 --> 00:12:08,513
just to

160
00:12:09,200 --> 00:12:10,753
make me fall completely in love with you.

161
00:12:12,440 --> 00:12:13,194
Yes.

162
00:12:15,159 --> 00:12:18,073
(So you really are as they say.)

163
00:12:19,440 --> 00:12:22,073
(Your affection was never genuine.)

164
00:12:26,080 --> 00:12:27,080
Then I'll ask you again,

165
00:12:28,840 --> 00:12:30,672
were you at the scene when the cultivators

166
00:12:31,799 --> 00:12:33,112
were killed that day?

167
00:12:36,960 --> 00:12:38,672
Are the Phantom Fox Darts you carry

168
00:12:40,280 --> 00:12:42,112
the weapons you used to kill them?

169
00:12:45,039 --> 00:12:46,039
So...

170
00:12:48,280 --> 00:12:50,032
You attacked them at Suiyue Mountain

171
00:12:51,320 --> 00:12:52,320
and killed them.

172
00:12:56,400 --> 00:12:57,400
Chang Yue!

173
00:13:03,039 --> 00:13:04,039
Soul-Devouring Herb.

174
00:13:11,400 --> 00:13:12,400
You poisoned me.

175
00:13:14,719 --> 00:13:15,719
Well done!

176
00:13:16,840 --> 00:13:17,840
Nicely done!

177
00:13:24,880 --> 00:13:25,880
Chang Yue,

178
00:13:26,080 --> 00:13:27,232
today, I will definitely kill you

179
00:13:27,320 --> 00:13:28,712
to avenge my dead peers.

180
00:13:32,666 --> 00:13:33,475
Sect Leader Huo...

181
00:13:34,920 --> 00:13:35,655
Chang Yue!

182
00:13:36,159 --> 00:13:37,599
That day, you killed so many cultivators

183
00:13:37,624 --> 00:13:38,938
in front of me.

184
00:13:39,559 --> 00:13:40,959
Today, I must

185
00:13:40,984 --> 00:13:42,617
avenge them.

186
00:13:51,119 --> 00:13:52,712
They say humans

187
00:13:53,159 --> 00:13:54,680
can twist right and wrong,

188
00:13:54,760 --> 00:13:56,873
that they are greedy and ungrateful.

189
00:13:57,760 --> 00:14:01,112
It is indeed true then.

190
00:14:04,599 --> 00:14:06,672
Enough talking before you die.

191
00:14:33,039 --> 00:14:35,032
Yuan Bao, are you defending him?

192
00:14:35,425 --> 00:14:36,578
He deceived me,

193
00:14:37,640 --> 00:14:38,580
so the one who takes his life

194
00:14:39,406 --> 00:14:40,406
should also be me.

195
00:15:26,760 --> 00:15:27,760
Take His Highness away.

196
00:15:28,640 --> 00:15:29,640
Your Highness, let's go.

197
00:15:36,365 --> 00:15:37,365
Give chase.

198
00:15:37,592 --> 00:15:38,592
No need.

199
00:15:39,159 --> 00:15:40,919
- But why?   - Be patient, Shu Ya.

200
00:15:41,119 --> 00:15:42,119
I have my plan.

201
00:15:45,479 --> 00:15:46,479
Yuan Bao,

202
00:15:47,119 --> 00:15:48,840
did you deliberately let him go?

203
00:16:22,119 --> 00:16:24,552
(Now, you also have flowers.)

204
00:16:25,640 --> 00:16:26,993
(The reason you approached me)

205
00:16:28,440 --> 00:16:30,592
is to complete the in-tandem cultivation

206
00:16:30,760 --> 00:16:32,313
and retrieve your soul from my body.

207
00:16:33,200 --> 00:16:34,200
Yes.

208
00:16:34,559 --> 00:16:36,193
You became my tutor,

209
00:16:36,479 --> 00:16:38,472
care for me, and protect me,

210
00:16:39,159 --> 00:16:40,232
just to

211
00:16:41,039 --> 00:16:42,552
make me fall completely in love with you.

212
00:16:43,719 --> 00:16:44,719
Yes.

213
00:16:47,159 --> 00:16:48,159
Chang Yue,

214
00:16:50,320 --> 00:16:51,873
from the very beginning,

215
00:16:54,719 --> 00:16:56,552
you have been lying to me.

216
00:18:11,839 --> 00:18:12,839
Your Highness.

217
00:18:14,280 --> 00:18:15,280
Your Highness, are you okay?

218
00:18:16,560 --> 00:18:17,560
Your Highness.

219
00:18:18,040 --> 00:18:19,040
Your Highness.

220
00:18:31,640 --> 00:18:32,879
Yuan Bao, what are you doing?

221
00:18:32,959 --> 00:18:33,993
Stop smashing it.

222
00:18:37,439 --> 00:18:39,519
Yuan Bao, stop smashing it.

223
00:18:39,599 --> 00:18:40,832
Your hands are bleeding.

224
00:18:43,199 --> 00:18:44,199
Hui!

225
00:18:48,560 --> 00:18:50,232
- Hui!   - Hui, what are you doing?

226
00:18:50,680 --> 00:18:52,873
Yuan Bao doesn't want it anymore, so I threw it away.

227
00:18:53,479 --> 00:18:54,633
He's just a fox.

228
00:18:54,839 --> 00:18:56,232
It's better to forget about him.

229
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:02,000
I can't forget about him.

230
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:06,000
- I can't.   - Yuan Bao!

231
00:19:06,239 --> 00:19:07,239
Yuan Bao!

232
00:19:07,319 --> 00:19:08,639
- Yuan Bao.   - What are you doing?

233
00:19:08,719 --> 00:19:10,120
- Yuan Bao, calm down!   - Let go of me.

234
00:19:10,200 --> 00:19:11,352
- Let go of me.   - Yuan Bao.

235
00:19:11,640 --> 00:19:13,633
- Let go of me.   - Calm down.

236
00:19:13,880 --> 00:19:14,952
Let go!

237
00:19:15,400 --> 00:19:17,159
Yuan Bao, calm down!

238
00:19:17,239 --> 00:19:18,793
Let go of me!

239
00:19:20,119 --> 00:19:21,399
- Yuan Bao.   - Let go of me!

240
00:19:21,479 --> 00:19:22,479
Yuan Bao!

241
00:19:22,559 --> 00:19:23,993
Let go of me!

242
00:19:28,400 --> 00:19:30,352
- Stop it.   - Let go of me!

243
00:19:30,839 --> 00:19:32,793
- Yuan Bao!   - Let go of me!

244
00:19:35,920 --> 00:19:36,920
Yuan Bao.

245
00:19:40,479 --> 00:19:41,479
Yuan Bao.

246
00:19:42,319 --> 00:19:43,712
Stop it.

247
00:19:52,680 --> 00:19:53,680
Yuan Bao!

248
00:20:04,405 --> 00:20:04,925
Your Highness.

249
00:20:06,359 --> 00:20:06,999
Your Highness.

250
00:20:07,722 --> 00:20:08,722
You're finally awake.

251
00:20:22,640 --> 00:20:23,640
Mohun?

252
00:20:24,800 --> 00:20:26,400
Isn't it with Qi Yuan Bao?

253
00:20:27,079 --> 00:20:28,352
How did it return to you?

254
00:20:29,920 --> 00:20:31,432
It has been abandoned.

255
00:20:35,905 --> 00:20:36,905
It's good that it's back.

256
00:20:37,520 --> 00:20:39,513
After all, Mohun is linked to your vitality.

257
00:20:40,199 --> 00:20:41,673
She shouldn't toy with it.

258
00:20:49,058 --> 00:20:50,058
Your Highness.

259
00:20:50,319 --> 00:20:51,319
Your Highness.

260
00:20:52,466 --> 00:20:53,466
Your Highness, are you okay?

261
00:21:01,758 --> 00:21:02,237
Your Highness

262
00:21:02,959 --> 00:21:04,832
do you know you ingested the Soul-Devouring Herb?

263
00:21:05,946 --> 00:21:06,591
I know.

264
00:21:08,119 --> 00:21:09,432
But you've always been so cautious.

265
00:21:09,680 --> 00:21:11,273
Who could have given you such a potent poison?

266
00:21:16,920 --> 00:21:17,920
Right.

267
00:21:18,359 --> 00:21:19,673
I should have known.

268
00:21:20,479 --> 00:21:22,273
In this world, besides Qi Yuan Bao,

269
00:21:22,439 --> 00:21:23,832
who can truly hurt you?

270
00:21:24,119 --> 00:21:26,192
She is too cruel.

271
00:21:28,119 --> 00:21:29,119
She doesn't trust me.

272
00:21:31,599 --> 00:21:33,592
Indeed, humans are heartless and ruthless.

273
00:21:34,119 --> 00:21:35,239
You gave up eight lives

274
00:21:35,319 --> 00:21:36,352
and showed sincerity to her,

275
00:21:36,839 --> 00:21:39,440
but they couldn't get you a shred

276
00:21:39,520 --> 00:21:40,520
of her pity or sincerity.

277
00:21:51,079 --> 00:21:52,232
Luckily, they are minor injuries.

278
00:21:52,439 --> 00:21:53,439
They are nothing serious.

279
00:21:57,920 --> 00:21:58,920
Yuan Bao.

280
00:21:59,520 --> 00:22:01,192
don't let that fox demon affect you.

281
00:22:02,280 --> 00:22:03,280
From now on,

282
00:22:03,719 --> 00:22:05,112
I will always be by your side,

283
00:22:05,239 --> 00:22:06,993
taking care of you and protecting you.

284
00:22:07,800 --> 00:22:09,232
He won't have another chance.

285
00:22:17,599 --> 00:22:19,033
Why are you looking at me like that?

286
00:22:19,680 --> 00:22:21,832
You knew the Truth Pill was poisonous.

287
00:22:24,439 --> 00:22:26,072
I know my father well.

288
00:22:26,599 --> 00:22:27,599
This matter

289
00:22:28,319 --> 00:22:29,592
has nothing to do with him.

290
00:22:30,280 --> 00:22:31,592
This has nothing to do with me either.

291
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:33,312
Sect Leader Su did it.

292
00:22:35,706 --> 00:22:37,301
Yuan Bao, don't fault him.

293
00:22:37,920 --> 00:22:39,200
He just wanted to make sure

294
00:22:39,280 --> 00:22:41,040
that he could completely kill that fox demon.

295
00:22:41,239 --> 00:22:42,279
Who knew that fox demon was so

296
00:22:42,359 --> 00:22:43,359
insidious and cunning?

297
00:22:44,040 --> 00:22:45,262
He managed to escape.

298
00:22:46,005 --> 00:22:47,068
What exactly is that poison?

299
00:22:47,959 --> 00:22:49,948
It can temporarily dampen spiritual power.

300
00:22:50,199 --> 00:22:51,312
It doesn't count as a poison.

301
00:23:01,199 --> 00:23:02,199
- Mr. Qi.   - Shu Ya.

302
00:23:02,239 --> 00:23:03,359
How are Yuan Bao's injuries?

303
00:23:03,439 --> 00:23:04,439
Mr. Qi, don't worry.

304
00:23:04,560 --> 00:23:05,639
They're just scratches.

305
00:23:05,719 --> 00:23:06,719
I've already bandaged them up.

306
00:23:07,359 --> 00:23:09,192
Also, she's already asleep.

307
00:23:09,959 --> 00:23:11,599
Qian Qian and Han Yu also came to see her.

308
00:23:11,839 --> 00:23:12,839
They looked tired,

309
00:23:12,919 --> 00:23:14,112
so I let them go back first.

310
00:23:15,560 --> 00:23:16,560
I'm grateful for your help.

311
00:23:16,685 --> 00:23:17,918
It's my duty.

312
00:23:19,439 --> 00:23:20,439
Mr. Qi,

313
00:23:21,378 --> 00:23:22,892
I want to talk to you.

314
00:23:26,500 --> 00:23:27,500
What are you doing?

315
00:23:27,806 --> 00:23:28,806
Get up quickly!

316
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:30,000
Mr. Qi.

317
00:23:32,913 --> 00:23:33,913
I want to ask

318
00:23:34,179 --> 00:23:35,321
for Yuan Bao's hand in marriage.

319
00:23:40,393 --> 00:23:41,666
Why so sudden?

320
00:23:42,332 --> 00:23:42,998
Mr. Qi,

321
00:23:43,959 --> 00:23:45,441
I know this matter

322
00:23:45,521 --> 00:23:46,793
may come as a surprise to you.

323
00:23:47,640 --> 00:23:49,112
But it's not for me.

324
00:23:51,520 --> 00:23:53,359
Yuan Bao and I grew up together.

325
00:23:53,439 --> 00:23:54,519
I have decided a long time ago

326
00:23:54,599 --> 00:23:55,673
that I want to marry her.

327
00:23:57,000 --> 00:23:58,999
To see her being tormented

328
00:23:59,079 --> 00:24:00,472
by that fox demon,

329
00:24:01,199 --> 00:24:02,793
I feel really bad.

330
00:24:02,959 --> 00:24:05,312
I hate myself for not asking you earlier.

331
00:24:08,199 --> 00:24:09,199
In the past,

332
00:24:10,040 --> 00:24:11,753
I didn't take good care of Yuan Bao.

333
00:24:12,374 --> 00:24:14,214
Mr. Qi, please give me a chance

334
00:24:14,239 --> 00:24:15,312
to make up for it.

335
00:24:16,560 --> 00:24:18,753
You are deeply devoted to Yuan Bao.

336
00:24:19,479 --> 00:24:22,553
I am very glad.

337
00:24:23,280 --> 00:24:25,273
But Yuan Bao has just suffered a huge blow.

338
00:24:25,439 --> 00:24:26,439
I'm afraid

339
00:24:28,599 --> 00:24:30,112
she doesn't have the mind

340
00:24:30,880 --> 00:24:32,312
to talk about marriage now.

341
00:24:32,920 --> 00:24:33,920
I can wait.

342
00:24:40,959 --> 00:24:41,959
Get up first.

343
00:24:45,680 --> 00:24:46,680
Shu Ya,

344
00:24:47,520 --> 00:24:48,913
you know Yuan Bao.

345
00:24:49,479 --> 00:24:51,080
She is opinionated.

346
00:24:51,160 --> 00:24:52,712
Even I can't control her.

347
00:24:54,280 --> 00:24:55,280
So I'll

348
00:24:56,760 --> 00:24:58,753
let her decide.

349
00:25:10,680 --> 00:25:11,680
Master.

350
00:25:12,599 --> 00:25:14,832
I'm afraid the Huo family

351
00:25:15,160 --> 00:25:16,793
has guessed Qi Yuan Bao's identity.

352
00:25:17,000 --> 00:25:18,840
On my way here, I saw Huo Shu Ya

353
00:25:18,920 --> 00:25:20,312
talking to Qi Lian about his marriage.

354
00:25:20,839 --> 00:25:21,839
What should we do?

355
00:25:28,359 --> 00:25:30,832
Since Huo Shu Ya wants to marry Qi Yuan Bao so much,

356
00:25:32,560 --> 00:25:33,913
let's give him a push.

357
00:25:34,800 --> 00:25:36,273
Let him get what he wants.

358
00:25:37,560 --> 00:25:39,513
If Qi Yuan Bao falls for Huo Shu Ya,

359
00:25:40,400 --> 00:25:43,153
then Chang Yue will never be able to retrieve his soul.

360
00:25:43,280 --> 00:25:46,520
Master, why are you so afraid of Chang Yue?

361
00:25:47,000 --> 00:25:48,119
He is the fox clan's

362
00:25:48,199 --> 00:25:49,673
future heavenly fox.

363
00:25:49,920 --> 00:25:51,553
Once he retrieves his soul and ascends,

364
00:25:51,839 --> 00:25:53,753
getting rid of Qi Yuan Bao

365
00:25:54,680 --> 00:25:56,633
will be an impossible task.

366
00:25:57,520 --> 00:25:58,520
Yun Rong,

367
00:25:58,706 --> 00:26:00,098
you know what to do, right?

368
00:26:00,620 --> 00:26:01,620
Yes.

369
00:26:01,700 --> 00:26:02,700
Of course.

370
00:26:13,239 --> 00:26:14,239
What are you thinking about?

371
00:26:22,079 --> 00:26:23,513
Chang Yue, is it?

372
00:26:25,439 --> 00:26:26,439
No.

373
00:26:26,680 --> 00:26:29,712
At this juncture,

374
00:26:30,439 --> 00:26:31,832
what's the point of bringing him up?

375
00:26:33,119 --> 00:26:35,033
Cultivators are searching for Chang Yue,

376
00:26:36,119 --> 00:26:37,913
but they haven't found any trace of him yet.

377
00:26:39,079 --> 00:26:42,472
(Maybe he's already returned to Beiming.)

378
00:26:44,793 --> 00:26:45,472
Yuan Bao.

379
00:26:47,400 --> 00:26:48,400
I...

380
00:26:52,079 --> 00:26:53,913
I have something to discuss with you.

381
00:26:57,439 --> 00:26:59,393
Shu Ya asked for your hand in marriage a few days ago.

382
00:26:59,680 --> 00:27:00,712
What do you think?

383
00:27:02,479 --> 00:27:03,479
Father,

384
00:27:03,606 --> 00:27:04,606
I won't marry him.

385
00:27:04,959 --> 00:27:06,280
But Shu Ya truly loves you.

386
00:27:06,360 --> 00:27:07,399
I don't know if he loves me

387
00:27:07,479 --> 00:27:08,592
or not.

388
00:27:08,839 --> 00:27:10,312
But what I know is

389
00:27:10,400 --> 00:27:12,279
I view him as my older brother.

390
00:27:12,359 --> 00:27:13,952
I've never had any romantic feelings for him.

391
00:27:14,947 --> 00:27:15,705
So

392
00:27:16,439 --> 00:27:17,633
I won't marry him.

393
00:27:25,479 --> 00:27:27,633
I knew this would be the answer.

394
00:27:28,749 --> 00:27:29,749
Fine.

395
00:27:30,160 --> 00:27:31,432
Since you've decided,

396
00:27:32,119 --> 00:27:33,119
I'll turn him down

397
00:27:33,680 --> 00:27:34,753
in a few days.

398
00:27:53,946 --> 00:27:55,886
Your Highness, why did you come out?

399
00:27:57,439 --> 00:27:58,832
Why aren't you resting?

400
00:28:01,359 --> 00:28:02,359
I came out for some air.

401
00:28:03,680 --> 00:28:04,680
Where did Aunt Meng Shu go?

402
00:28:04,959 --> 00:28:06,352
She went to find you an antidote.

403
00:28:07,359 --> 00:28:08,359
Antidote?

404
00:28:11,319 --> 00:28:12,319
The Soul-Devouring Herb

405
00:28:12,520 --> 00:28:13,793
has no antidote at all.

406
00:28:14,599 --> 00:28:17,033
Besides, I am a Red-Tailed Silver Fox.

407
00:28:17,400 --> 00:28:19,393
The poison will make me sick,

408
00:28:19,920 --> 00:28:20,865
but it won't kill me.

409
00:28:21,520 --> 00:28:23,753
So the Soul-Devouring Herb won't do anything to you at all?

410
00:28:26,986 --> 00:28:27,708
Oh, no.

411
00:28:29,466 --> 00:28:31,898
Don't come closer.

412
00:28:32,400 --> 00:28:33,999
- Don't come closer.   - Mother.

413
00:28:34,024 --> 00:28:36,297
Don't come closer.

414
00:28:41,126 --> 00:28:42,126
Aunt Meng Shu.

415
00:28:42,400 --> 00:28:44,000
- You mustn't hurt anyone.   - Chang Yue,

416
00:28:44,080 --> 00:28:45,513
do you know what you're doing?

417
00:28:45,760 --> 00:28:46,832
I'm saving you!

418
00:28:47,359 --> 00:28:48,440
An infant's blood

419
00:28:48,520 --> 00:28:49,920
can be made into Blood Marrow Pills,

420
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:51,513
which can remove the toxin in you.

421
00:28:52,439 --> 00:28:53,913
I know you're doing this out of kindness.

422
00:28:54,680 --> 00:28:56,273
The Soul-Devouring Herb will give me pain,

423
00:28:56,378 --> 00:28:57,491
but it won't kill me.

424
00:28:58,106 --> 00:28:59,106
Moreover,

425
00:28:59,439 --> 00:29:00,800
if I have to sacrifice innocent people

426
00:29:00,880 --> 00:29:02,520
to save my life, I would rather

427
00:29:02,600 --> 00:29:03,673
die.

428
00:29:04,652 --> 00:29:06,399
Humans are ungrateful.

429
00:29:06,479 --> 00:29:08,513
They frame you. They hunt you down.

430
00:29:08,640 --> 00:29:09,879
Why are you still siding with them?

431
00:29:09,959 --> 00:29:12,553
What humans do is none of my business.

432
00:29:13,119 --> 00:29:14,119
As for me,

433
00:29:14,199 --> 00:29:15,832
I only seek to act without a guilty conscience.

434
00:29:17,300 --> 00:29:18,372
Whether it's humans or

435
00:29:18,880 --> 00:29:19,880
or foxes,

436
00:29:20,680 --> 00:29:22,712
I will never kill an innocent life.

437
00:29:24,039 --> 00:29:25,912
You're still so naive.

438
00:29:26,680 --> 00:29:28,513
Humans are treacherous.

439
00:29:28,920 --> 00:29:30,232
They don't deserve mercy.

440
00:29:31,040 --> 00:29:32,040
If you don't believe me,

441
00:29:32,560 --> 00:29:33,633
one day,

442
00:29:34,199 --> 00:29:36,159
your heart will be shattered by humans.

443
00:29:36,239 --> 00:29:37,070
Even so,

444
00:29:38,800 --> 00:29:40,793
I won't regret my choice today.

445
00:29:42,839 --> 00:29:43,839
Aunt Meng Shu,

446
00:29:44,680 --> 00:29:45,753
let them go.

447
00:29:45,920 --> 00:29:46,920
You...

448
00:29:47,199 --> 00:29:48,199
Fine.

449
00:30:02,319 --> 00:30:03,999
Help! The fox demon is killing people again!

450
00:30:04,079 --> 00:30:05,153
Someone's dead.

451
00:30:06,359 --> 00:30:08,993
Recently, more innocent people have died in the city.

452
00:30:09,760 --> 00:30:10,760
We checked the bodies.

453
00:30:11,040 --> 00:30:12,041
We found traces

454
00:30:12,280 --> 00:30:14,072
of Phantom Fox Darts.

455
00:30:15,199 --> 00:30:17,633
Everyone in the city is saying

456
00:30:17,760 --> 00:30:18,843
that the fox demon did it.

457
00:30:19,560 --> 00:30:21,913
The people are living in fear.

458
00:30:22,118 --> 00:30:23,118
Moreover...

459
00:30:24,826 --> 00:30:25,826
Moreover what?

460
00:30:27,093 --> 00:30:28,153
Everyone is saying

461
00:30:28,560 --> 00:30:29,999
that Yuan Bao colluded with the fox demon

462
00:30:30,079 --> 00:30:31,153
and let it escape,

463
00:30:31,439 --> 00:30:32,952
causing more people to die.

464
00:30:37,160 --> 00:30:38,592
Send more disciples down the mountain

465
00:30:39,119 --> 00:30:40,633
to search for Chang Yue.

466
00:30:40,800 --> 00:30:42,359
- Noted.   - Make sure

467
00:30:42,719 --> 00:30:44,753
Yuan Bao doesn't know about this.

468
00:30:45,160 --> 00:30:46,160
Okay.

469
00:30:52,880 --> 00:30:53,880
Mr. Huo,

470
00:30:57,760 --> 00:30:58,760
Sect Leader Su.

471
00:31:00,359 --> 00:31:02,320
The fox demon has been killing people in the city.

472
00:31:02,400 --> 00:31:03,432
Have you heard?

473
00:31:04,432 --> 00:31:06,585
Everyone talks about it,

474
00:31:06,760 --> 00:31:07,832
and so I've heard about it.

475
00:31:09,736 --> 00:31:11,530
Some people are now very resentful

476
00:31:11,610 --> 00:31:12,610
towards Yuan Bao.

477
00:31:13,280 --> 00:31:15,681
They're worried that the soul in her will be taken away.

478
00:31:15,761 --> 00:31:17,393
It will bring disaster to the world.

479
00:31:18,400 --> 00:31:19,879
Those people might soon

480
00:31:19,959 --> 00:31:21,352
make a scene at Qishan Sect,

481
00:31:21,640 --> 00:31:22,879
demanding Sect Leader Qi

482
00:31:22,959 --> 00:31:24,232
to hand over Yuan Bao.

483
00:31:26,839 --> 00:31:27,873
Don't worry, Sect Leader Su.

484
00:31:28,119 --> 00:31:29,592
I will definitely protect Yuan Bao.

485
00:31:31,359 --> 00:31:32,913
Okay, I have something to do,

486
00:31:33,079 --> 00:31:34,506
- I'll get going.   - Okay.

487
00:31:54,800 --> 00:31:55,285
Wait.

488
00:31:56,439 --> 00:31:58,352
All of you part hastily.

489
00:31:58,520 --> 00:31:59,600
Did something happen?

490
00:31:59,680 --> 00:32:00,680
No.

491
00:32:00,760 --> 00:32:02,279
Some petty thieves came.

492
00:32:02,359 --> 00:32:04,393
Master asked us to get rid of them.

493
00:32:05,199 --> 00:32:06,800
- That's right.   - Are you sure?

494
00:32:06,880 --> 00:32:08,913
When have I ever lied to you?

495
00:32:09,239 --> 00:32:10,239
Let's go.

496
00:32:19,520 --> 00:32:20,592
Yuan Bao, your roasted chicken.

497
00:32:22,800 --> 00:32:23,800
What's wrong?

498
00:32:23,959 --> 00:32:24,959
Why do you cover your face?

499
00:32:25,400 --> 00:32:26,400
I'm fine.

500
00:32:26,479 --> 00:32:27,479
It's nothing.

501
00:32:32,719 --> 00:32:33,832
What happened to your face?

502
00:32:35,839 --> 00:32:37,952
I tripped and fell.

503
00:32:38,160 --> 00:32:39,160
You fell?

504
00:32:40,719 --> 00:32:41,719
What exactly happened?

505
00:32:45,880 --> 00:32:46,880
Tell me.

506
00:32:53,920 --> 00:32:54,565
Okay.

507
00:32:55,239 --> 00:32:56,312
You're not going to tell me.

508
00:32:56,640 --> 00:32:58,425
- I'll find out myself.   - Don't.

509
00:32:59,079 --> 00:33:00,079
Don't go.

510
00:33:00,680 --> 00:33:01,753
I'll tell you everything.

511
00:33:02,400 --> 00:33:04,399
Recently, many people in Beixuan City

512
00:33:04,479 --> 00:33:05,592
have been killed by a fox demon.

513
00:33:05,920 --> 00:33:07,200
There's a group of people gathering

514
00:33:07,280 --> 00:33:08,365
at the gate of Qishan Sect.

515
00:33:08,640 --> 00:33:09,753
They're furious,

516
00:33:09,880 --> 00:33:11,266
and will hit anyone from our sect.

517
00:33:11,680 --> 00:33:13,312
They demand an explanation from us,

518
00:33:13,560 --> 00:33:14,633
and to hand you over.

519
00:33:15,079 --> 00:33:16,276
If you go out now,

520
00:33:17,079 --> 00:33:18,553
they will tear you apart.
