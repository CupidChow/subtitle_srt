1
00:01:48,732 --> 00:01:53,979
(Dear Mr. Heavenly Fox)

2
00:01:54,052 --> 00:01:57,025
(Episode 20)

3
00:02:08,080 --> 00:02:09,080
Chang Yue.

4
00:02:10,139 --> 00:02:12,587
If you don't eat it this time,

5
00:02:12,720 --> 00:02:14,152
I'm not going to talk to you anymore.

6
00:02:29,080 --> 00:02:30,832
Why did someone send the luncheon box again?

7
00:02:31,080 --> 00:02:32,600
Your Highness, let me take that away.

8
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:38,000
No need.

9
00:02:38,559 --> 00:02:39,559
You're dismissed.

10
00:02:42,320 --> 00:02:43,320
Great.

11
00:02:43,733 --> 00:02:45,256
Chang Yue is finally eating my food.

12
00:02:48,800 --> 00:02:49,800
Come out.

13
00:02:53,639 --> 00:02:55,320
Do I need to ask someone to drag you out?

14
00:03:14,639 --> 00:03:15,639
Chang Yue.

15
00:03:17,639 --> 00:03:18,639
Qi Yuan Bao.

16
00:03:20,119 --> 00:03:21,119
Are you done with this farce?

17
00:03:24,800 --> 00:03:26,440
Is it because my food

18
00:03:26,520 --> 00:03:27,520
is too disgusting?

19
00:03:27,800 --> 00:03:29,233
I know my cooking isn't good.

20
00:03:30,039 --> 00:03:31,039
- But...   - Enough.

21
00:03:31,520 --> 00:03:32,713
No need to do this.

22
00:03:33,600 --> 00:03:35,433
And no need to put up a show in front of me.

23
00:03:36,360 --> 00:03:36,975
Speak.

24
00:03:37,839 --> 00:03:38,993
What exactly do you want

25
00:03:39,360 --> 00:03:40,752
in Beiming this time?

26
00:03:43,593 --> 00:03:44,415
Chang Yue,

27
00:03:46,600 --> 00:03:48,472
I know you're still angry with me.

28
00:03:49,479 --> 00:03:50,672
I don't expect

29
00:03:51,479 --> 00:03:53,192
to be forgiven.

30
00:03:54,320 --> 00:03:55,399
But I truly came here

31
00:03:55,479 --> 00:03:56,752
without another motive.

32
00:03:58,080 --> 00:03:59,080
I

33
00:03:59,240 --> 00:04:01,272
just want to return your soul.

34
00:04:08,279 --> 00:04:09,873
How dare you mention that again?

35
00:04:13,160 --> 00:04:15,233
Chang Yue, take your soul back.

36
00:04:18,119 --> 00:04:19,672
Are you trying to embarrass me?

37
00:04:21,359 --> 00:04:22,359
You don't love me.

38
00:04:22,760 --> 00:04:24,512
How can I take out my soul?

39
00:04:25,720 --> 00:04:27,199
If you can take out your soul,

40
00:04:27,279 --> 00:04:28,512
it means I do love you.

41
00:04:29,079 --> 00:04:30,079
Just try it.

42
00:04:30,559 --> 00:04:31,952
Just try it, okay?

43
00:04:33,119 --> 00:04:34,672
Just believe me one more time.

44
00:04:54,839 --> 00:04:55,839
But now,

45
00:04:56,480 --> 00:04:58,160
I no longer care if you love me or not.

46
00:05:01,079 --> 00:05:02,079
Leave.

47
00:05:03,040 --> 00:05:04,433
Don't bother me again.

48
00:05:04,724 --> 00:05:06,602
You... You're lying.

49
00:05:06,880 --> 00:05:08,482
I know you're lying to me.

50
00:05:09,079 --> 00:05:11,672
You said that your feelings were genuine.

51
00:05:11,880 --> 00:05:13,654
that you treated me with sincerity.

52
00:05:13,799 --> 00:05:15,640
- So you...   - Qi Yuan Bao.

53
00:05:21,160 --> 00:05:22,713
Do you know what kind of relationship

54
00:05:23,079 --> 00:05:24,153
I have with Yi Xuan?

55
00:05:27,231 --> 00:05:28,231
What...

56
00:05:29,440 --> 00:05:31,232
What kind of relationship?

57
00:05:32,972 --> 00:05:34,245
Surely you'd have guessed it

58
00:05:36,119 --> 00:05:37,119
even if I don't tell you.

59
00:05:40,200 --> 00:05:43,159
The difference between you and Yi Xuan

60
00:05:43,239 --> 00:05:44,239
is like night and day.

61
00:05:45,320 --> 00:05:46,320
So,

62
00:05:48,200 --> 00:05:49,792
it's impossible for me to fall for you again.

63
00:05:52,880 --> 00:05:53,880
If you're sensible,

64
00:05:56,959 --> 00:05:58,352
don't pester me anymore.

65
00:06:21,480 --> 00:06:23,392
You won't fall for me anymore?

66
00:06:33,559 --> 00:06:34,559
Leave.

67
00:07:36,959 --> 00:07:37,959
Chang Yue.

68
00:07:40,440 --> 00:07:42,512
Am I getting further and further away from you?

69
00:08:15,174 --> 00:08:16,295
Yes. It's so beautiful.

70
00:08:16,320 --> 00:08:17,320
It's so beautiful.

71
00:08:17,679 --> 00:08:18,679
It's pretty.

72
00:08:18,720 --> 00:08:20,680
Miss Yi Xuan, are you making a robe

73
00:08:20,760 --> 00:08:21,760
for Prince Yan?

74
00:08:24,279 --> 00:08:25,392
Oh, I know.

75
00:08:25,799 --> 00:08:29,400
You are making a robe for Prince Chang Yue.

76
00:08:29,480 --> 00:08:31,473
- Exactly.   - It must be for him.

77
00:08:31,760 --> 00:08:33,152
Prince Chang Yue.

78
00:08:35,719 --> 00:08:36,800
I haven't made a robe

79
00:08:36,880 --> 00:08:37,880
for Chang Yue for a long time.

80
00:08:38,320 --> 00:08:40,352
He's gotten thinner recently,

81
00:08:40,599 --> 00:08:41,599
and his old robes

82
00:08:41,719 --> 00:08:42,792
don't fit anymore.

83
00:08:43,470 --> 00:08:45,800
So I thought I'd make him another one.

84
00:08:45,880 --> 00:08:47,712
Your needlework is really good.

85
00:08:48,039 --> 00:08:49,959
This fox pattern is sewn so vividly and uniquely.

86
00:08:50,039 --> 00:08:51,960
- His Highness will definitely like it.   - Exactly.

87
00:08:52,040 --> 00:08:53,920
Miss Yi Xuan is not only good at needlework,

88
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:55,472
but her medical skills are also superb.

89
00:08:55,719 --> 00:08:58,112
And she's also proficient in music, chess, calligraphy, and painting.

90
00:09:00,359 --> 00:09:02,279
- Young Lady is so amazing!   - I agree.

91
00:09:02,359 --> 00:09:03,359
Miss Qi,

92
00:09:03,880 --> 00:09:05,232
why are you standing there?

93
00:09:08,119 --> 00:09:09,119
Your Highness.

94
00:09:10,359 --> 00:09:11,840
Your Highness, this is the robe Miss Yi Xuan

95
00:09:11,920 --> 00:09:13,152
just sent over.

96
00:09:13,359 --> 00:09:14,800
The workmanship and the material

97
00:09:14,880 --> 00:09:15,880
are top quality.

98
00:09:16,145 --> 00:09:17,499
- Do you want to try it on?   - No need.

99
00:09:18,119 --> 00:09:19,880
- Just put it there.   - Then I'll put it away.

100
00:09:26,640 --> 00:09:28,833
Your Highness, this robe of yours is already torn.

101
00:09:29,119 --> 00:09:30,273
Should I throw it away for you?

102
00:09:33,159 --> 00:09:35,079
- No need.   - But the difference

103
00:09:35,159 --> 00:09:36,839
between this robe and what Miss Yi Xuan

104
00:09:36,919 --> 00:09:38,393
just sent is like night and day.

105
00:09:38,679 --> 00:09:39,792
Why keep it?

106
00:09:40,479 --> 00:09:41,479
Like night and day...

107
00:09:45,479 --> 00:09:46,479
Keep it.

108
00:09:47,039 --> 00:09:49,993
What I like ultimately is the inferior version.

109
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:52,833
Your Highness!

110
00:09:53,400 --> 00:09:54,400
Quick!

111
00:09:54,840 --> 00:09:56,393
Your Highness, take a look.

112
00:09:56,719 --> 00:09:58,201
These valuables were all specially selected

113
00:09:58,281 --> 00:09:59,281
according to

114
00:09:59,320 --> 00:10:00,320
Miss Yi Xuan's preferences.

115
00:10:00,799 --> 00:10:01,920
See which one is more suitable

116
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:04,232
to be given out as a birthday gift.

117
00:10:05,819 --> 00:10:06,819
I'm not good at this.

118
00:10:07,159 --> 00:10:07,932
Just handle it yourself.

119
00:10:08,239 --> 00:10:09,912
Okay, leave it to me!

120
00:10:19,200 --> 00:10:20,633
Come. Put this here.

121
00:10:20,880 --> 00:10:21,880
And put this one over there.

122
00:10:22,119 --> 00:10:23,119
Here.

123
00:10:29,440 --> 00:10:30,440
Hurry up.

124
00:10:32,359 --> 00:10:34,560
Why is it so lively in the palace today?

125
00:10:34,640 --> 00:10:35,680
Today is Yi Xuan's birthday.

126
00:10:35,760 --> 00:10:37,912
Of course, it's lively. Foxes from all the palaces will come.

127
00:10:38,479 --> 00:10:40,232
Then Chang Yue will also be here, right?

128
00:10:41,159 --> 00:10:42,159
Right.

129
00:10:42,320 --> 00:10:44,112
Given his relationship with Yi Xuan,

130
00:10:44,440 --> 00:10:45,440
he'll definitely be here.

131
00:10:46,599 --> 00:10:49,279
What are you mumbling about this time?

132
00:10:49,359 --> 00:10:50,359
Nothing.

133
00:10:51,359 --> 00:10:52,801
Let's go. Today, let me

134
00:10:52,881 --> 00:10:54,232
show you the festivities.

135
00:10:54,919 --> 00:10:56,193
No, thanks. I'm not coming.

136
00:10:57,679 --> 00:10:58,679
You're not coming?

137
00:10:58,759 --> 00:10:59,839
Like it or not, you're coming.

138
00:10:59,919 --> 00:11:00,919
No!

139
00:11:00,960 --> 00:11:02,112
Let go of me. I'm not coming.

140
00:11:02,440 --> 00:11:03,440
- Let's go.   - No.

141
00:11:03,520 --> 00:11:05,592
It's such a good opportunity. Don't walk away.

142
00:11:05,919 --> 00:11:07,552
Take a good look.

143
00:11:10,752 --> 00:11:11,752
Where are you going again?

144
00:11:12,239 --> 00:11:13,239
Give me your hand.

145
00:11:20,679 --> 00:11:22,352
How is it? Impressive, isn't it?

146
00:11:24,159 --> 00:11:25,232
Luxurious, isn't it?

147
00:11:27,440 --> 00:11:29,232
Surely, you haven't seen a view like this.

148
00:11:31,159 --> 00:11:32,352
You hillbilly.

149
00:11:32,679 --> 00:11:33,679
You...

150
00:11:42,080 --> 00:11:43,279
Let's find a place

151
00:11:43,359 --> 00:11:44,359
to sit down.

152
00:11:47,960 --> 00:11:49,000
I'm going to sit over there.

153
00:11:49,080 --> 00:11:50,080
Where are you going?

154
00:11:56,440 --> 00:11:57,800
I know what you're thinking.

155
00:11:57,880 --> 00:12:00,032
You want to sit opposite Chang Yue to stare at him.

156
00:12:00,245 --> 00:12:01,546
- No!   - No what?

157
00:12:02,239 --> 00:12:03,352
I know I'm right.

158
00:12:03,599 --> 00:12:04,873
I won't let you have your way.

159
00:12:05,320 --> 00:12:06,960
Come. Go over there.

160
00:12:07,359 --> 00:12:08,359
Sit there.

161
00:12:11,479 --> 00:12:12,479
Go in.

162
00:12:40,240 --> 00:12:41,272
Are you serious?

163
00:12:41,679 --> 00:12:43,712
You're sitting in the back, and you're still staring at him?

164
00:12:44,239 --> 00:12:46,680
Who's staring at him?

165
00:12:46,886 --> 00:12:47,750
I'm just

166
00:12:49,039 --> 00:12:50,039
looking around.

167
00:12:58,719 --> 00:12:59,719
I didn't expect

168
00:13:00,520 --> 00:13:02,073
Yi Xuan's birthday banquet

169
00:13:02,599 --> 00:13:03,633
to be this elaborate.

170
00:13:04,679 --> 00:13:06,232
You really are ignorant.

171
00:13:07,239 --> 00:13:08,239
Let me tell you.

172
00:13:08,440 --> 00:13:10,360
When Yi Xuan and Chang Yue get married,

173
00:13:10,440 --> 00:13:11,558
it'll be more spectacular.

174
00:13:13,679 --> 00:13:14,679
Married?

175
00:13:14,919 --> 00:13:16,760
Yes. What's wrong with that?

176
00:13:23,280 --> 00:13:24,873
When are they getting married?

177
00:13:25,193 --> 00:13:27,426
It sounds like you're looking forward to it.

178
00:13:37,320 --> 00:13:38,320
Yes.

179
00:13:39,400 --> 00:13:41,760
Yi Xuan's marriage to the fox clan's crown prince

180
00:13:41,840 --> 00:13:43,273
will definitely be a grand affair.

181
00:13:44,440 --> 00:13:46,393
How could I miss that?

182
00:14:24,599 --> 00:14:26,753
Today is Yi Xuan's birthday.

183
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:29,273
We've gathered to celebrate this auspicious occasion.

184
00:14:29,520 --> 00:14:30,912
So everyone, please don't be shy.

185
00:14:31,200 --> 00:14:32,313
Eat and drink freely!

186
00:14:32,880 --> 00:14:34,552
Thank you, Grandmother Bi Xi.

187
00:14:42,599 --> 00:14:43,325
Sit down.

188
00:14:44,773 --> 00:14:45,773
Hu Zhi Zhi.

189
00:14:46,440 --> 00:14:47,953
Bring up my gift.

190
00:14:49,919 --> 00:14:50,919
Yi Xuan,

191
00:14:51,159 --> 00:14:53,513
we found these rare and exotic plants for you

192
00:14:54,200 --> 00:14:55,753
to help you make elixirs.

193
00:14:56,679 --> 00:14:57,679
Thank you, Grandmother Bi Xi.

194
00:15:06,673 --> 00:15:07,311
Yi Xuan,

195
00:15:08,200 --> 00:15:09,472
this Phoenix Butterfly Gilded Hairpin

196
00:15:09,760 --> 00:15:10,993
will suit you so well.

197
00:15:11,919 --> 00:15:12,919
Thank you, Aunt Meng Shu.

198
00:15:13,039 --> 00:15:14,039
I love it.

199
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:17,000
Chang Yue,

200
00:15:18,080 --> 00:15:20,073
what gift did you prepare for Yi Xuan?

201
00:15:23,492 --> 00:15:24,492
It's here.

202
00:15:36,400 --> 00:15:37,712
A Lovesick Jade Bracelet.

203
00:15:40,280 --> 00:15:41,280
Chang Yue,

204
00:15:41,719 --> 00:15:42,792
I like it so much.

205
00:15:58,359 --> 00:15:59,359
Yi Xuan,

206
00:15:59,919 --> 00:16:01,479
- I...   - At this juncture,

207
00:16:02,280 --> 00:16:04,433
I'd like to discuss something important with everyone.

208
00:16:06,400 --> 00:16:08,433
Yi Xuan and Chang Yue are deeply in love.

209
00:16:08,799 --> 00:16:09,799
Why not officialize

210
00:16:09,919 --> 00:16:11,120
their marital arrangement

211
00:16:11,200 --> 00:16:12,200
today?

212
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:14,000
What do you think?

213
00:16:15,200 --> 00:16:16,200
Great.

214
00:16:16,280 --> 00:16:17,953
This is truly a double blessing!

215
00:16:23,039 --> 00:16:24,993
Our clan is finally going to a merry banquet.

216
00:16:25,679 --> 00:16:27,880
I've always said that Miss Yi Xuan and His Highness

217
00:16:27,960 --> 00:16:28,960
are a match

218
00:16:29,039 --> 00:16:30,073
made in heaven.

219
00:16:38,400 --> 00:16:39,400
What's wrong, you ugly freak?

220
00:16:43,640 --> 00:16:45,201
My robe is dirty. I'm going to get changed.

221
00:16:45,281 --> 00:16:46,552
Get changed?

222
00:16:47,880 --> 00:16:49,679
You have never been this particular before.

223
00:16:56,840 --> 00:16:57,840
Chang Yue,

224
00:16:59,400 --> 00:17:00,753
what do you think

225
00:17:01,080 --> 00:17:02,232
of my proposal earlier?

226
00:17:05,760 --> 00:17:06,760
Grandmother Bi Xi,

227
00:17:07,160 --> 00:17:08,531
I've never thought about getting married.

228
00:17:10,599 --> 00:17:12,553
It's never too late to start thinking about it.

229
00:17:21,800 --> 00:17:22,800
Grandmother Bi Xi,

230
00:17:23,239 --> 00:17:24,793
my marriage to Chang Yue

231
00:17:25,119 --> 00:17:26,633
still needs to be discussed.

232
00:17:30,800 --> 00:17:33,192
We haven't seen each other in a long time.

233
00:17:33,680 --> 00:17:35,352
So getting married

234
00:17:35,760 --> 00:17:37,592
is a bit too hasty.

235
00:17:44,640 --> 00:17:45,640
You're such

236
00:17:46,199 --> 00:17:47,712
a thoughtful and understanding child.

237
00:17:48,520 --> 00:17:49,520
All right.

238
00:17:49,560 --> 00:17:51,072
If this is what you two want,

239
00:17:51,479 --> 00:17:53,112
we'll discuss this matter later.

240
00:18:30,400 --> 00:18:32,033
Stupid Chang Yue.

241
00:18:32,599 --> 00:18:33,832
Getting married?

242
00:18:34,439 --> 00:18:35,913
Get married then.

243
00:18:36,040 --> 00:18:37,432
No one cares.

244
00:18:42,599 --> 00:18:43,599
That's right.

245
00:18:44,520 --> 00:18:45,832
Why should I care?

246
00:18:46,319 --> 00:18:47,592
Compared to her,

247
00:18:47,839 --> 00:18:50,513
I'm just the worst.

248
00:18:51,040 --> 00:18:52,793
What right do I have to care?

249
00:19:01,680 --> 00:19:03,440
Ugly freak, what are you yelling about at this hour?

250
00:19:03,520 --> 00:19:04,633
Others are sleeping.

251
00:19:05,680 --> 00:19:06,680
You're so noisy!

252
00:19:07,160 --> 00:19:08,239
Then get lost!

253
00:19:08,319 --> 00:19:09,432
Why are you eavesdropping then?

254
00:19:09,680 --> 00:19:11,352
Listen up. I've put up with you for a long time.

255
00:19:11,520 --> 00:19:12,520
You dare to scold me now?

256
00:19:12,560 --> 00:19:13,560
You've gotten bold!

257
00:19:13,640 --> 00:19:15,033
Yes, I've gotten bold. What's wrong?

258
00:19:15,319 --> 00:19:16,432
I've gotten bold.

259
00:19:16,800 --> 00:19:18,039
Hit me if you can.

260
00:19:18,119 --> 00:19:19,119
Come on, hit me!

261
00:19:19,520 --> 00:19:21,600
If you don't hit me, you're a total wimp.

262
00:19:21,735 --> 00:19:23,175
Do you really think I wouldn't hit you?

263
00:19:23,200 --> 00:19:24,913
Hit me!

264
00:19:26,040 --> 00:19:26,811
Hit me!

265
00:19:27,079 --> 00:19:29,623
Why are you just standing there? Hit me!

266
00:19:30,615 --> 00:19:31,735
Can't you hit someone?

267
00:19:31,760 --> 00:19:32,840
Hit me like this! Like this!

268
00:19:32,920 --> 00:19:33,920
Hit me!

269
00:19:34,599 --> 00:19:36,673
What makes you think I'll do as you ask?

270
00:19:37,123 --> 00:19:38,352
Hit me!

271
00:19:38,649 --> 00:19:39,720
Hit me.

272
00:19:39,800 --> 00:19:41,280
You're drunk. I won't take you seriously.

273
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:46,159
Why are you crying?

274
00:19:46,239 --> 00:19:48,192
Weren't you going to get changed? Why are you crying here?

275
00:19:50,920 --> 00:19:52,192
Let me tell you something.

276
00:19:53,798 --> 00:19:56,913
I won't be staying here for long.

277
00:19:57,599 --> 00:19:58,599
I'm leaving soon.

278
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:00,000
Then leave!

279
00:20:00,160 --> 00:20:01,160
No one's going to stop you.

280
00:20:03,319 --> 00:20:04,319
Right.

281
00:20:06,640 --> 00:20:07,960
No one here

282
00:20:08,040 --> 00:20:09,040
wants me to stay anyway.

283
00:20:09,760 --> 00:20:11,432
This isn't my home.

284
00:20:12,160 --> 00:20:13,832
If Chang Yue won't ask me to stay,

285
00:20:14,920 --> 00:20:16,393
who will?

286
00:20:17,920 --> 00:20:20,553
No one cares about me.

287
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:22,480
I don't mean that.

288
00:20:22,560 --> 00:20:23,633
I don't mean that.

289
00:20:24,319 --> 00:20:26,081
Don't cry. You look hideous when you cry.

290
00:20:26,161 --> 00:20:27,273
So what if I'm ugly?

291
00:20:27,520 --> 00:20:28,800
No one cares even if I'm ugly.

292
00:20:28,880 --> 00:20:30,359
Chang Yue doesn't even want me anymore.

293
00:20:30,439 --> 00:20:33,192
He's going to marry another woman.

294
00:20:37,439 --> 00:20:38,999
Hit me! Why aren't you hitting me?

295
00:20:39,079 --> 00:20:41,119
Just punch me a couple of times!

296
00:20:41,199 --> 00:20:42,199
Stop hitting me.

297
00:20:43,319 --> 00:20:44,519
All my life, this is the first time

298
00:20:44,599 --> 00:20:45,673
someone hit me.

299
00:20:45,920 --> 00:20:46,920
I have pride too.

300
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:48,673
Consider this an honor.

301
00:20:49,319 --> 00:20:50,432
Are all human women

302
00:20:50,599 --> 00:20:51,793
like this when they are drunk?

303
00:20:53,520 --> 00:20:55,352
That's why Chang Yue will not marry you.

304
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:17,432
This constant stopping and starting...

305
00:21:17,680 --> 00:21:19,432
When will we ever get to Suiyue Mountain?

306
00:21:36,119 --> 00:21:37,832
I wonder how much further we have to go.

307
00:21:39,319 --> 00:21:40,680
- Master.   - Give it to them.

308
00:21:40,753 --> 00:21:41,432
Sir.

309
00:21:41,926 --> 00:21:42,926
Thank you.

310
00:21:47,880 --> 00:21:49,592
Qi Lian that old fox

311
00:21:49,800 --> 00:21:52,633
insists on resting every other day.

312
00:21:53,199 --> 00:21:55,192
He's clearly stalling for time.

313
00:21:55,839 --> 00:21:56,839
And Qi Yuan Bao

314
00:21:56,919 --> 00:21:57,919
is also very strange.

315
00:21:58,273 --> 00:22:00,305
You know Qi Yuan Bao's temper.

316
00:22:00,800 --> 00:22:01,873
She's usually mischievous.

317
00:22:02,119 --> 00:22:03,119
How could she possibly

318
00:22:03,160 --> 00:22:04,673
sit so quietly in the carriage now?

319
00:22:04,920 --> 00:22:06,793
It's not like her at all.

320
00:22:11,259 --> 00:22:13,252
We can't afford any mistakes in this matter.

321
00:22:13,640 --> 00:22:15,192
Ask Su Shen Shen to test her.

322
00:22:15,439 --> 00:22:16,439
Noted.

323
00:22:24,078 --> 00:22:25,078
Shen.

324
00:22:25,199 --> 00:22:26,199
Yun Rong.

325
00:22:32,119 --> 00:22:33,119
Why?

326
00:22:34,680 --> 00:22:36,393
What exactly are you suspecting her of?

327
00:22:37,199 --> 00:22:39,072
Master must have his own reasons.

328
00:22:39,652 --> 00:22:41,793
Shen, let's follow orders.

329
00:22:52,460 --> 00:22:53,460
I'm suffocating.

330
00:22:54,920 --> 00:22:56,119
Cover up! Someone will see you.

331
00:22:56,199 --> 00:22:57,359
No one will see me. Why?

332
00:22:57,439 --> 00:22:58,686
I'm not Yuan Bao so you want me dead?

333
00:22:59,520 --> 00:23:00,520
Cover up. It's dangerous!

334
00:23:00,599 --> 00:23:01,599
Don't touch me.

335
00:23:04,920 --> 00:23:06,793
Why are your sister and Yun Rong coming this way?

336
00:23:07,880 --> 00:23:10,112
What now? Shen Shen doesn't have freedom either?

337
00:23:16,873 --> 00:23:17,873
What's wrong, Shen?

338
00:23:18,319 --> 00:23:19,633
I accidentally twisted my ankle.

339
00:23:20,400 --> 00:23:20,949
Does it hurt?

340
00:23:21,680 --> 00:23:22,680
It hurts a lot.

341
00:23:22,920 --> 00:23:24,112
Your sister twisted her ankle.

342
00:23:25,280 --> 00:23:26,280
What do we do?

343
00:23:26,384 --> 00:23:27,206
Quiet.

344
00:23:27,473 --> 00:23:28,945
Miss Qi, Mr. Xue,

345
00:23:29,760 --> 00:23:31,399
Shen accidentally twisted her ankle.

346
00:23:31,479 --> 00:23:32,993
Would you mind if she rode in your carriage?

347
00:23:33,153 --> 00:23:33,867
No way!

348
00:23:36,239 --> 00:23:37,993
This is Qishan Sect's best healing ointment.

349
00:23:38,199 --> 00:23:39,199
It works instantly.

350
00:23:39,280 --> 00:23:40,280
Mr. Xue,

351
00:23:40,359 --> 00:23:41,519
Shen's foot injury is serious,

352
00:23:41,599 --> 00:23:43,472
and she can't take a step now.

353
00:23:45,520 --> 00:23:46,520
I'm very concerned about her.

354
00:23:46,599 --> 00:23:47,599
I ask for your understanding.

355
00:23:47,800 --> 00:23:48,879
- Oh, no.   - If she comes in,

356
00:23:48,959 --> 00:23:49,959
she'll know it's me.

357
00:23:51,119 --> 00:23:52,119
Miss Su.

358
00:23:55,520 --> 00:23:56,520
Mr. Qi.

359
00:23:56,599 --> 00:23:58,574
Miss Su, the carriage is too small.

360
00:23:58,719 --> 00:24:00,033
Three people can't fit in it.

361
00:24:00,439 --> 00:24:01,439
Mr. Qi,

362
00:24:01,680 --> 00:24:03,753
you are usually the most sensible.

363
00:24:04,400 --> 00:24:06,232
Why won't you help us

364
00:24:06,599 --> 00:24:08,112
now that I'm injured?

365
00:24:10,560 --> 00:24:11,800
You know Yuan Bao.

366
00:24:11,880 --> 00:24:12,880
She likes to cause trouble.

367
00:24:13,359 --> 00:24:14,840
If she gets upset,

368
00:24:14,920 --> 00:24:15,920
I...

369
00:24:17,359 --> 00:24:18,359
Mr. Qi.

370
00:24:19,400 --> 00:24:20,400
Forgive me then.

371
00:24:20,560 --> 00:24:22,779
Pardon my intrusion.

372
00:24:23,560 --> 00:24:25,280
Don't come near us.

373
00:24:25,360 --> 00:24:26,680
Yuan Bao and I both have smallpox.

374
00:24:26,760 --> 00:24:28,321
It's so itchy! It's a contagious disease.

375
00:24:28,401 --> 00:24:29,633
This is a contagious disease.

376
00:24:32,040 --> 00:24:33,232
Don't come near us.

377
00:24:35,119 --> 00:24:36,192
Don't come near us.

378
00:24:40,719 --> 00:24:42,359
It's so itchy. I might die.

379
00:24:43,479 --> 00:24:45,633
At first, I didn't want to tell everyone about this,

380
00:24:45,800 --> 00:24:47,312
lest it causes unnecessary problems.

381
00:24:47,680 --> 00:24:49,400
But since everyone knows now,

382
00:24:49,700 --> 00:24:50,732
I won't hide it anymore.

383
00:24:51,160 --> 00:24:52,273
Worry not.

384
00:24:52,479 --> 00:24:53,680
As long as you don't ride with them,

385
00:24:53,760 --> 00:24:55,720
don't stay with them, and don't eat with them,

386
00:24:55,800 --> 00:24:57,232
you won't be infected.

387
00:25:01,280 --> 00:25:03,273
Yuan Bao, you've also contracted smallpox?

388
00:25:03,471 --> 00:25:05,513
I'm very worried about you. Can I take a look?

389
00:25:10,772 --> 00:25:11,772
Yuan Bao?

390
00:25:12,839 --> 00:25:13,445
Yuan Bao?

391
00:25:14,959 --> 00:25:15,652
Yuan Bao?

392
00:25:16,280 --> 00:25:16,818
Yuan Bao.

393
00:25:31,280 --> 00:25:33,393
(That is indeed the scar from the severed spirit root.)

394
00:25:33,959 --> 00:25:35,393
(She is Qi Yuan Bao.)

395
00:25:38,599 --> 00:25:40,312
Miss Su, please go back for now.

396
00:25:42,560 --> 00:25:43,560
Shu Ya.

397
00:25:44,479 --> 00:25:46,439
You should go back quickly to avoid being infected.

398
00:25:47,040 --> 00:25:48,040
Right.

399
00:26:04,920 --> 00:26:06,153
We made it.

400
00:26:06,560 --> 00:26:07,920
Luckily, Yuan Bao was provident.

401
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:09,553
She prepared this medicine for me in advance.

402
00:26:10,199 --> 00:26:11,199
She

403
00:26:11,239 --> 00:26:12,480
does have really good foresight.

404
00:26:12,560 --> 00:26:13,760
She told me that Huo Shu Ya

405
00:26:13,840 --> 00:26:14,999
would seek the scar on her hand,

406
00:26:15,079 --> 00:26:16,153
and he really did that.

407
00:26:17,560 --> 00:26:18,720
But when can we take the antidote?

408
00:26:18,800 --> 00:26:19,800
This is too itchy.

409
00:26:20,160 --> 00:26:21,513
Let's just bear with it a little longer.

410
00:26:22,040 --> 00:26:23,359
The Huo family really has

411
00:26:23,439 --> 00:26:24,439
ulterior motives towards her.

412
00:26:24,680 --> 00:26:26,439
We can't let our efforts be wasted.

413
00:26:26,520 --> 00:26:28,119
If I get disfigured because of Yuan Bao,

414
00:26:28,199 --> 00:26:28,732
I'll...

415
00:26:44,239 --> 00:26:45,362
Before

416
00:26:46,023 --> 00:26:48,656
I even have the time to visit Beiming,

417
00:26:49,479 --> 00:26:50,762
and I have to leave already.

418
00:27:00,560 --> 00:27:01,560
Chang Yue.

419
00:27:03,920 --> 00:27:04,920
Your soul...

420
00:27:06,160 --> 00:27:07,633
Are you really sure you don't want it?

421
00:28:13,680 --> 00:28:14,680
Chang Yue,

422
00:28:17,400 --> 00:28:20,232
I'm leaving tomorrow.

423
00:28:23,760 --> 00:28:24,760
Okay.

424
00:28:27,512 --> 00:28:28,512
I wish you

425
00:28:30,119 --> 00:28:31,312
happiness.

426
00:28:34,319 --> 00:28:35,319
Okay.

427
00:28:39,711 --> 00:28:41,453
(Since you don't love me,)

428
00:28:41,614 --> 00:28:43,694
(what's the point of retrieving my soul?)

429
00:28:47,400 --> 00:28:49,472
(Since you're going to marry Yi Xuan,)

430
00:28:50,680 --> 00:28:52,432
(what's the point of staying here?)

431
00:28:54,184 --> 00:28:55,642
(As for your soul,)

432
00:28:56,040 --> 00:28:58,410
(I'll find a way to return it to you.)
