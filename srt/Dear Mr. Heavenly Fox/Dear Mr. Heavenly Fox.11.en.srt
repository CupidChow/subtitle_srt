1
00:01:48,922 --> 00:01:53,959
(Dear Mr. Heavenly Fox)

2
00:01:54,079 --> 00:01:57,122
(Episode 11)

3
00:01:57,680 --> 00:01:59,122
Dumplings are here!

4
00:02:01,567 --> 00:02:02,158
Father.

5
00:02:02,556 --> 00:02:04,016
- Try them!   - Okay.

6
00:02:04,041 --> 00:02:05,078
See if they are delicious.

7
00:02:05,159 --> 00:02:05,682
Okay.

8
00:02:11,039 --> 00:02:12,698
How is it, Father? How's the taste?

9
00:02:15,279 --> 00:02:16,279
Delicious.

10
00:02:16,440 --> 00:02:18,199
- So delicious!   - Really?

11
00:02:19,440 --> 00:02:20,642
I'll try one too.

12
00:02:24,520 --> 00:02:25,520
So salty.

13
00:02:26,159 --> 00:02:27,159
Father.

14
00:02:27,240 --> 00:02:28,720
Do you truly think they're good?

15
00:02:28,800 --> 00:02:30,479
Why do I think they're awful?

16
00:02:30,559 --> 00:02:31,892
As long as you made them,

17
00:02:31,973 --> 00:02:33,526
I think they're delicious.

18
00:02:34,639 --> 00:02:36,944
Then, I'll keep making them for you tomorrow.

19
00:02:37,046 --> 00:02:38,710
I'll try to make them delicious next time.

20
00:02:38,791 --> 00:02:39,791
Okay.

21
00:02:39,911 --> 00:02:41,122
I'll cook with you tomorrow.

22
00:02:47,960 --> 00:02:48,960
This...

23
00:02:49,320 --> 00:02:50,682
It's a little undercooked.

24
00:02:52,320 --> 00:02:53,602
I'll try another one.

25
00:02:55,800 --> 00:02:57,752
Do me a favor, just try one.

26
00:02:58,960 --> 00:03:00,322
Isn't it delicious?

27
00:03:03,796 --> 00:03:05,242
Still raw!

28
00:03:05,679 --> 00:03:07,322
How come you think it's good?

29
00:03:07,759 --> 00:03:10,002
(Speaking of which, after I returned here,)

30
00:03:10,399 --> 00:03:12,042
(even the little fox is gone.)

31
00:03:12,679 --> 00:03:14,602
(Why did it leave without saying goodbye)

32
00:03:14,880 --> 00:03:16,162
(like Chang Yue?)

33
00:03:19,048 --> 00:03:20,729
Yuan Bao, what are you thinking about?

34
00:03:20,880 --> 00:03:22,202
Why aren't you eating?

35
00:03:23,039 --> 00:03:24,322
It's nothing.

36
00:03:24,759 --> 00:03:26,002
Oh, Father.

37
00:03:34,015 --> 00:03:35,015
Father,

38
00:03:36,199 --> 00:03:37,802
you can have this back.

39
00:03:39,199 --> 00:03:41,752
I was childish enough

40
00:03:41,880 --> 00:03:43,082
to seek the answer,

41
00:03:43,279 --> 00:03:44,402
to seek the truth.

42
00:03:44,639 --> 00:03:45,672
I always thought it was

43
00:03:45,839 --> 00:03:46,975
more important than anything.

44
00:03:47,479 --> 00:03:49,713
I went against you every day,

45
00:03:49,872 --> 00:03:51,771
making you angry and annoyed.

46
00:03:52,069 --> 00:03:53,635
But now that I'm all grown up,

47
00:03:54,040 --> 00:03:55,482
I finally understand it.

48
00:03:56,199 --> 00:03:57,873
Nothing is more important

49
00:03:58,479 --> 00:04:00,600
than spending time with you.

50
00:04:01,379 --> 00:04:03,002
(And I wish)

51
00:04:03,399 --> 00:04:05,362
(you could stay a child forever.)

52
00:04:10,360 --> 00:04:11,360
Yuan Bao.

53
00:04:12,559 --> 00:04:14,202
This is your mother's keepsake.

54
00:04:14,919 --> 00:04:16,153
Keep it

55
00:04:17,640 --> 00:04:19,002
if you like it.

56
00:04:28,200 --> 00:04:29,799
Oh, right. Father,

57
00:04:30,279 --> 00:04:32,193
I also prepared a gift for you.

58
00:04:32,401 --> 00:04:33,762
A gift?

59
00:04:44,359 --> 00:04:45,359
Father.

60
00:04:45,799 --> 00:04:48,842
This is a birthday gift I prepared for you.

61
00:04:49,526 --> 00:04:50,882
Birthday gift?

62
00:04:52,720 --> 00:04:54,672
My birthday was months ago.

63
00:04:55,720 --> 00:04:57,313
I know.

64
00:04:57,966 --> 00:04:59,438
It's all your fault

65
00:04:59,524 --> 00:05:01,198
for locking me up at Jingsi Cliff,

66
00:05:01,294 --> 00:05:03,208
so I didn't have time to retrieve it.

67
00:05:06,279 --> 00:05:07,279
Open it.

68
00:05:23,279 --> 00:05:24,562
Do you like it?

69
00:05:25,920 --> 00:05:26,920
I love it.

70
00:05:27,239 --> 00:05:28,239
(Father,)

71
00:05:28,399 --> 00:05:30,242
(when I'm not around,)

72
00:05:30,480 --> 00:05:32,593
(I hope this sword can stay by your side)

73
00:05:33,079 --> 00:05:34,352
(and protect you.)

74
00:05:42,839 --> 00:05:44,282
(Someone's broken in.)

75
00:05:49,279 --> 00:05:50,642
It's you.

76
00:05:54,160 --> 00:05:56,792
You seem to be in a hurry.

77
00:05:56,879 --> 00:05:58,718
You must have something important to do.

78
00:05:58,845 --> 00:06:01,079
Aren't you in Beiming guarding the fox clan?

79
00:06:01,399 --> 00:06:02,792
What are you doing in the mortal realm?

80
00:06:02,946 --> 00:06:04,242
As far as I know,

81
00:06:04,422 --> 00:06:06,896
under the sacred tree barrier in Suiyue Mountain

82
00:06:07,119 --> 00:06:09,272
lies the Corpse Puppet King.

83
00:06:10,239 --> 00:06:11,762
That day, the spirit particle appeared.

84
00:06:11,920 --> 00:06:13,482
The sacred tree was shaken,

85
00:06:13,600 --> 00:06:14,656
and the barrier was damaged.

86
00:06:15,200 --> 00:06:17,080
I'm afraid anyone can enter

87
00:06:17,105 --> 00:06:18,805
the Corpse Puppet King's mausoleum.

88
00:06:19,119 --> 00:06:20,562
If someone breaks in,

89
00:06:20,800 --> 00:06:22,152
your plans all these years

90
00:06:22,399 --> 00:06:23,792
will be ruined.

91
00:06:25,972 --> 00:06:27,452
What else do you know?

92
00:06:29,160 --> 00:06:30,882
I know a lot more than you think.

93
00:06:31,119 --> 00:06:32,119
For example,

94
00:06:32,247 --> 00:06:34,162
Qi Yuan Bao is the spirit particle.

95
00:06:34,640 --> 00:06:36,882
You're counting on her to awaken the Corpse Puppet King

96
00:06:37,040 --> 00:06:39,522
so that you can obtain his power.

97
00:06:39,839 --> 00:06:41,602
No need to attack me.

98
00:06:42,200 --> 00:06:43,962
Considering we are friends,

99
00:06:44,600 --> 00:06:45,600
today,

100
00:06:45,839 --> 00:06:47,753
I'm here to lend you a hand.

101
00:06:51,079 --> 00:06:52,842
Why would you help me?

102
00:06:55,799 --> 00:06:57,202
Phantom Fox Dart?

103
00:06:58,674 --> 00:07:00,952
It's your fox clan's unique throwing weapon.

104
00:07:01,559 --> 00:07:02,559
What?

105
00:07:02,799 --> 00:07:04,322
You're going to give it to me?

106
00:07:04,519 --> 00:07:06,153
Aren't you afraid I'll use it to kill people

107
00:07:06,399 --> 00:07:08,272
and then frame your fox clan?

108
00:07:09,920 --> 00:07:11,482
That's exactly what I want.

109
00:07:13,519 --> 00:07:14,722
And you

110
00:07:14,959 --> 00:07:16,120
must do just that.

111
00:07:16,239 --> 00:07:18,602
Why should I do your bidding?

112
00:07:21,079 --> 00:07:22,322
Sect Leader Su,

113
00:07:23,239 --> 00:07:24,753
I'm sure you know

114
00:07:24,920 --> 00:07:28,002
that Qi Yuan Bao is accompanied by someone powerful, Chang Yue.

115
00:07:28,760 --> 00:07:30,162
Who is he?

116
00:07:30,320 --> 00:07:33,128
What's his purpose in approaching Qi Yuan Bao?

117
00:07:40,880 --> 00:07:42,672
Your Highness, you're finally awake.

118
00:07:42,845 --> 00:07:44,122
I'll inform the others.

119
00:07:44,359 --> 00:07:45,359
Your Highness.

120
00:07:56,320 --> 00:07:58,802
Your Highness, are you looking for the Posuo Leaf?

121
00:07:59,239 --> 00:08:01,112
Don't worry. I've put it away for you.

122
00:08:08,327 --> 00:08:09,327
How long have I been asleep?

123
00:08:09,597 --> 00:08:12,082
You've been asleep for over half a month.

124
00:08:12,888 --> 00:08:14,201
I need to save Yuan Bao now.

125
00:08:14,385 --> 00:08:15,385
No, Your Highness.

126
00:08:15,526 --> 00:08:16,808
Your injuries haven't healed yet.

127
00:08:16,959 --> 00:08:17,959
Wait?

128
00:08:18,640 --> 00:08:20,562
It will be too late.

129
00:08:21,359 --> 00:08:22,642
Grandmother.

130
00:08:22,880 --> 00:08:24,193
Yuan Bao is in grave danger.

131
00:08:24,480 --> 00:08:25,952
I have to go back and save her.

132
00:08:26,160 --> 00:08:28,119
I'll come back and serve my punishment later.

133
00:08:41,239 --> 00:08:42,482
Chang Yue.

134
00:08:46,400 --> 00:08:47,682
Grandmother.

135
00:08:47,960 --> 00:08:49,602
Always remember

136
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:51,560
that retrieving the Soul Fruit for our clan

137
00:08:51,710 --> 00:08:53,722
and ascending successfully should be your only goal.

138
00:08:54,080 --> 00:08:55,402
Don't give in to temptation

139
00:08:55,640 --> 00:08:57,362
and dwell in the mortal realm.

140
00:08:57,719 --> 00:09:02,833
The survival of all our people depends on you.

141
00:09:03,239 --> 00:09:04,592
I will never forget that.

142
00:09:20,119 --> 00:09:22,472
Yue, have you found anything suspicious?

143
00:09:22,719 --> 00:09:23,962
Not at all.

144
00:09:24,080 --> 00:09:26,082
Why was there an anomaly at Suiyue Mountain?

145
00:09:26,359 --> 00:09:28,402
What exactly happened that day?

146
00:09:35,809 --> 00:09:37,150
Let's go take a look.

147
00:09:52,719 --> 00:09:54,642
There's a barrier here.

148
00:09:55,168 --> 00:09:56,575
Is there something inside?

149
00:09:56,719 --> 00:09:58,162
Let's go in and see.

150
00:10:24,080 --> 00:10:26,322
Is this the mausoleum in the story?

151
00:10:26,479 --> 00:10:29,002
It's said that the Corpse Puppet King is sealed in the mausoleum.

152
00:10:29,200 --> 00:10:30,479
The Corpse Puppet King is powerful.

153
00:10:30,644 --> 00:10:32,839
It can turn the world upside down.

154
00:10:33,848 --> 00:10:35,367
A century ago, Corpse Puppet King appeared,

155
00:10:35,479 --> 00:10:36,682
wreaking havoc on the world.

156
00:10:36,799 --> 00:10:38,120
The spirit particle sacrificed herself

157
00:10:38,216 --> 00:10:39,842
to suppress him with her flesh.

158
00:10:40,119 --> 00:10:41,402
I didn't expect to find it here.

159
00:10:41,559 --> 00:10:43,482
I didn't expect this either.

160
00:10:43,640 --> 00:10:45,313
I even read in Demon Hunting Chronicles

161
00:10:45,478 --> 00:10:47,398
that if a human obtains the Corpse Puppet King's power,

162
00:10:47,579 --> 00:10:48,900
we can live as long as the universe

163
00:10:48,981 --> 00:10:50,653
and become the strongest people in the world.

164
00:11:05,239 --> 00:11:06,522
Phantom Fox Dart!

165
00:11:36,159 --> 00:11:37,682
Who are you?

166
00:11:38,119 --> 00:11:40,682
Find out in your afterlife.

167
00:11:46,031 --> 00:11:47,799
- I'll go after them.   - No need.

168
00:11:59,535 --> 00:12:00,722
Phantom Fox Dart.

169
00:12:00,919 --> 00:12:02,053
Phantom Fox Dart?

170
00:12:02,876 --> 00:12:04,561
Why is our weapon here?

171
00:12:04,919 --> 00:12:06,577
Could it be someone from my clan?

172
00:12:17,989 --> 00:12:19,139
He's still alive.

173
00:12:19,262 --> 00:12:20,562
Take him to Huo family's post station.

174
00:12:20,780 --> 00:12:22,491
I'll head to Qishan Sect to save Yuan Bao.

175
00:12:22,760 --> 00:12:24,882
Your Highness, why save these cultivators?

176
00:12:25,190 --> 00:12:26,304
Even an ant deserves saving.

177
00:12:26,509 --> 00:12:28,002
Let alone a person.

178
00:12:28,280 --> 00:12:30,282
- Just do as I say.   - Noted.

179
00:12:37,320 --> 00:12:39,482
Why would humans have Phantom Fox Darts?

180
00:12:47,160 --> 00:12:48,160
Grandmother.

181
00:12:48,485 --> 00:12:49,885
Chang Yue. Why so sudden?

182
00:12:49,990 --> 00:12:51,642
Did something happen?

183
00:12:52,119 --> 00:12:54,280
Did your injury get worse?

184
00:12:54,840 --> 00:12:55,958
Grandmother, don't worry.

185
00:12:56,054 --> 00:12:57,381
I am fine for now.

186
00:12:57,679 --> 00:12:59,193
I want to ask if anyone

187
00:12:59,400 --> 00:13:00,953
took Phantom Fox Dart away recently.

188
00:13:01,200 --> 00:13:02,442
Phantom Fox Dart?

189
00:13:03,200 --> 00:13:05,522
It has always been in Beiming. No one has taken it away.

190
00:13:08,559 --> 00:13:11,042
Why do you have the Phantom Fox Dart?

191
00:13:11,264 --> 00:13:14,122
Someone stole Phantom Fox Dart to kill people and framed us.

192
00:13:14,359 --> 00:13:16,242
Please investigate this thoroughly, Grandmother.

193
00:13:16,400 --> 00:13:17,962
Such a thing happened?

194
00:13:18,900 --> 00:13:19,505
Chang Yue.

195
00:13:20,359 --> 00:13:22,282
The mortal world is dangerous and you're injured.

196
00:13:22,559 --> 00:13:24,840
You must retrieve the Soul Fruit and return quickly.

197
00:13:25,019 --> 00:13:26,402
Duly noted.

198
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:39,242
I didn't fail my mission.

199
00:13:39,359 --> 00:13:40,922
I need to find His Highness now.

200
00:13:47,919 --> 00:13:49,840
- It's Master!   - Hurry!

201
00:13:50,640 --> 00:13:52,082
- Master!   - Come.

202
00:13:52,264 --> 00:13:53,682
- Master!   - Take this.

203
00:14:02,675 --> 00:14:06,002
(Am I dying?)

204
00:14:06,242 --> 00:14:07,602
Yuan Bao.

205
00:14:09,799 --> 00:14:10,799
Yuan Bao.

206
00:14:13,320 --> 00:14:14,320
Yuan Bao.

207
00:14:14,437 --> 00:14:15,437
The weather's so nice today.

208
00:14:15,518 --> 00:14:16,882
Let's go fly a kite.

209
00:14:24,201 --> 00:14:25,842
Yuan Bao, you look terrible.

210
00:14:26,080 --> 00:14:26,785
Are you okay?

211
00:14:27,200 --> 00:14:29,082
I'm fine.

212
00:14:29,440 --> 00:14:31,073
I didn't sleep well last night.

213
00:14:33,385 --> 00:14:35,308
Let's fly a kite.

214
00:14:35,719 --> 00:14:37,032
Are you sure you're okay?

215
00:14:37,168 --> 00:14:38,168
I'm fine.

216
00:14:38,359 --> 00:14:39,359
Let's go.

217
00:14:40,239 --> 00:14:41,239
Let's go.

218
00:14:42,919 --> 00:14:44,719
Look. It's flying so high.

219
00:14:44,919 --> 00:14:45,919
Did you see that?

220
00:14:46,006 --> 00:14:47,719
- (Han Yu.)   - Did you see it? It's flying so high!

221
00:14:47,800 --> 00:14:49,553
(I hope you could always be like this.)

222
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:51,440
- (Carefree.)   - Yuan Bao, did you see it?

223
00:14:51,520 --> 00:14:52,962
I saw it.

224
00:14:55,719 --> 00:14:56,719
As expected of you.

225
00:14:56,939 --> 00:14:58,660
See? Aren't I amazing?

226
00:14:59,080 --> 00:14:59,779
You're amazing.

227
00:15:00,520 --> 00:15:01,672
As expected of you.

228
00:15:08,679 --> 00:15:10,313
Yuan Bao.

229
00:15:11,679 --> 00:15:13,393
Yuan Bao.

230
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:25,799
- Yuan Bao.   - Yuan Bao.

231
00:15:26,655 --> 00:15:27,655
Yuan Bao.

232
00:15:27,799 --> 00:15:28,882
Uncle Qi.

233
00:15:29,119 --> 00:15:30,442
How about I feed her?

234
00:15:30,639 --> 00:15:32,322
Yuan Bao always listens to me.

235
00:15:39,080 --> 00:15:40,402
Yuan Bao.

236
00:15:46,520 --> 00:15:47,882
Yuan Bao.

237
00:15:48,520 --> 00:15:50,602
I know you usually don't like bitter things.

238
00:15:51,239 --> 00:15:52,682
I put some sugar in it.

239
00:15:52,919 --> 00:15:54,880
Don't worry. I already tasted it.

240
00:15:55,159 --> 00:15:56,442
It's not bitter.

241
00:16:02,400 --> 00:16:03,682
Yuan Bao.

242
00:16:03,929 --> 00:16:04,929
Yuan Bao.

243
00:16:05,041 --> 00:16:06,162
Sect Leader Qi.

244
00:16:06,761 --> 00:16:07,761
Sect Leader Qi.

245
00:16:07,888 --> 00:16:09,440
Shu Ya is back with the Purple Scale Fruit.

246
00:16:09,585 --> 00:16:10,585
Mr. Qi.

247
00:16:10,719 --> 00:16:13,122
I gave the Purple Scale Fruit to Qi Liu to brew the medicine.

248
00:16:19,520 --> 00:16:20,882
The medicine is here.

249
00:16:21,320 --> 00:16:23,082
The medicine is here.

250
00:16:26,599 --> 00:16:28,578
Mr. Qi, how is Yuan Bao?

251
00:16:29,440 --> 00:16:31,418
She's taken the medicine. She'll definitely get better.

252
00:16:35,479 --> 00:16:37,200
Shu Ya, you're badly injured.

253
00:16:37,386 --> 00:16:38,892
- Get a physician to look at it.   - I'm fine.

254
00:16:39,479 --> 00:16:40,802
Let's wait until Yuan Bao wakes up.

255
00:16:41,004 --> 00:16:42,265
You have a deep affection for Yuan Bao.

256
00:16:42,290 --> 00:16:43,547
It's her blessing.

257
00:16:43,840 --> 00:16:44,782
Thank you so much this time.

258
00:16:45,520 --> 00:16:47,680
I am endlessly grateful.

259
00:16:47,705 --> 00:16:48,489
Mr. Qi,

260
00:16:49,400 --> 00:16:50,163
you're too kind.

261
00:16:51,679 --> 00:16:52,790
I'm willing to do anything.

262
00:16:53,512 --> 00:16:55,362
to save Yuan Bao.

263
00:17:22,479 --> 00:17:23,922
How is Yuan Bao?

264
00:17:25,319 --> 00:17:26,862
Still no improvement.

265
00:17:27,019 --> 00:17:28,162
Sect Leader Qi,

266
00:17:28,359 --> 00:17:30,322
perhaps you should see her.

267
00:17:31,839 --> 00:17:35,112
Am I going to have to bury my own daughter?

268
00:17:53,239 --> 00:17:54,802
Yuan Bao.

269
00:18:42,880 --> 00:18:44,562
Yuan Bao.

270
00:18:44,800 --> 00:18:48,762
I will definitely protect you.

271
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:53,002
Definitely.

272
00:18:56,552 --> 00:18:57,955
You dummy.

273
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:01,482
You should learn to protect yourself first.

274
00:19:03,119 --> 00:19:05,122
When I'm not around,

275
00:19:06,119 --> 00:19:08,602
and someone bullies you again, what will happen to you?

276
00:19:58,119 --> 00:20:01,922
Young Master, your injuries will take time to heal.

277
00:20:03,239 --> 00:20:04,239
It's nothing.

278
00:20:05,239 --> 00:20:06,762
Has Yuan Bao woken up?

279
00:20:07,119 --> 00:20:08,922
No news yet.

280
00:20:09,479 --> 00:20:10,602
I'll go see her.

281
00:20:10,707 --> 00:20:12,802
Young Master, you're still injured.

282
00:20:18,857 --> 00:20:21,442
This little trinket can keep her entertained.

283
00:20:23,319 --> 00:20:24,032
Young Master.

284
00:21:53,472 --> 00:21:54,928
Chang Yue.

285
00:21:56,359 --> 00:21:58,442
Why haven't you appeared yet?

286
00:21:59,938 --> 00:22:01,882
I'm so tired from waiting.

287
00:22:03,479 --> 00:22:05,040
If...

288
00:22:07,199 --> 00:22:09,282
If you don't appear soon,

289
00:22:11,249 --> 00:22:14,002
you might never see me again.

290
00:22:54,479 --> 00:22:56,402
(Is this another dream?)

291
00:23:26,839 --> 00:23:28,802
Is this a hallucination

292
00:23:29,193 --> 00:23:31,155
for someone who's about to die?

293
00:23:32,698 --> 00:23:34,362
Didn't you say

294
00:23:36,119 --> 00:23:38,082
you never wanted to see me again?

295
00:23:45,880 --> 00:23:47,762
I don't want to see you again.

296
00:23:48,664 --> 00:23:49,986
Leave.

297
00:23:55,183 --> 00:23:56,922
Then I'll leave.

298
00:24:20,959 --> 00:24:22,882
It's just a dream anyway.

299
00:24:25,081 --> 00:24:27,362
(If only it weren't a dream.)

300
00:25:41,479 --> 00:25:43,252
Let's go over there in a bit.

301
00:25:43,345 --> 00:25:44,402
Okay.

302
00:25:44,719 --> 00:25:46,611
You finally have time. Let me buy you a meal

303
00:25:46,692 --> 00:25:48,493
- down the mountain.   - Thank you.

304
00:25:50,959 --> 00:25:51,959
Mr. Huo.

305
00:25:52,613 --> 00:25:53,613
Mr. Huo.

306
00:25:57,400 --> 00:25:59,482
(Who exactly is Chang Yue?)

307
00:26:00,453 --> 00:26:02,682
(And why does he have the fox clan's Posuo Leaf?)

308
00:26:04,040 --> 00:26:05,602
(Yuan Bao and he...)

309
00:26:10,259 --> 00:26:12,162
Huo, how's Yuan Bao?

310
00:26:17,558 --> 00:26:18,558
Huo!

311
00:26:46,418 --> 00:26:47,059
Yuan Bao.

312
00:26:50,776 --> 00:26:51,354
Yuan Bao.

313
00:26:51,880 --> 00:26:53,442
Uncle Qi, Yuan Bao is awake.

314
00:26:55,359 --> 00:26:56,762
Xue Han Yu.

315
00:26:57,880 --> 00:26:58,792
- Yuan Bao.   - Yuan Bao.

316
00:27:00,719 --> 00:27:01,921
- Help Yuan Bao up.   - Okay.

317
00:27:02,031 --> 00:27:03,322
Yuan Bao, take it easy.

318
00:27:17,239 --> 00:27:19,202
Wasn't I at Jingsi Cliff?

319
00:27:19,520 --> 00:27:21,002
How did I get here?

320
00:27:23,119 --> 00:27:24,472
Yuan Bao is completely healed!

321
00:27:24,760 --> 00:27:26,042
She is?

322
00:27:27,359 --> 00:27:28,882
I'm healed?

323
00:27:29,539 --> 00:27:30,762
I...

324
00:27:31,000 --> 00:27:33,042
But wasn't my heart meridian severed?

325
00:27:33,175 --> 00:27:34,762
It was beyond medical help.

326
00:27:35,221 --> 00:27:37,501
The Purple Scale Fruit completely repaired your heart meridian.

327
00:27:37,631 --> 00:27:40,359
Yes. That fruit is wondrous.

328
00:27:40,470 --> 00:27:43,064
- Exactly.   - Purple Scale Fruit?

329
00:27:43,330 --> 00:27:47,312
Yuan Bao You must thank Shu Ya properly.

330
00:28:17,948 --> 00:28:19,322
You wrench!

331
00:28:19,525 --> 00:28:21,242
How dare you betray me?

332
00:28:21,359 --> 00:28:23,562
I'm now a laughingstock!

333
00:28:23,728 --> 00:28:25,962
If you have any shame left,

334
00:28:27,239 --> 00:28:29,122
just kill yourself!

335
00:28:52,118 --> 00:28:53,522
Shu Ya?

336
00:28:56,760 --> 00:28:58,202
Shu Ya?

337
00:29:00,719 --> 00:29:02,482
Shu Ya, are you there?

338
00:29:09,760 --> 00:29:10,922
He's not here?

339
00:29:11,040 --> 00:29:12,202
Miss Qi.

340
00:29:12,680 --> 00:29:14,553
Young Master has been traveling for the past few days

341
00:29:14,727 --> 00:29:16,082
and is quite exhausted.

342
00:29:16,177 --> 00:29:18,562
He should still be resting right now.

343
00:29:19,528 --> 00:29:20,528
I see.

344
00:29:20,680 --> 00:29:23,599
Okay. Then please give this to him.

345
00:29:23,719 --> 00:29:25,642
Make sure he drinks this broth.

346
00:29:25,880 --> 00:29:27,599
Also, thank him for me.

347
00:29:27,703 --> 00:29:29,322
Tell him I'll come another day.

348
00:29:29,719 --> 00:29:31,882
- Thank you, Miss Qi.   - Likewise.

349
00:29:39,079 --> 00:29:40,633
Young Master, you're awake.

350
00:29:42,064 --> 00:29:43,507
Miss Qi just came by.

351
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:45,322
She looked like she was full of energy.

352
00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:47,802
The Purple Scale Fruit must have worked.

353
00:29:48,199 --> 00:29:49,426
Your efforts were not in vain.

354
00:29:50,839 --> 00:29:53,153
Huo, it's been a while now.

355
00:29:53,445 --> 00:29:55,402
Why is Yuan Bao still in so much pain?

356
00:29:55,640 --> 00:29:58,682
Perhaps the Purple Scale Fruit didn't work at all?

357
00:30:03,199 --> 00:30:04,199
Young Master.

358
00:30:05,599 --> 00:30:06,292
Young Master?

359
00:30:07,533 --> 00:30:09,842
Miss Qi sure cares a lot about you.

360
00:30:10,239 --> 00:30:12,442
She brought this broth for you

361
00:30:12,719 --> 00:30:14,153
and asked me

362
00:30:14,373 --> 00:30:16,286
to take good care of you.

363
00:30:18,239 --> 00:30:20,192
- Did she really say that?   - Would I lie to you?

364
00:30:28,985 --> 00:30:30,362
I knew it.

365
00:30:31,319 --> 00:30:33,033
Yuan Bao must have been forced.

366
00:30:34,986 --> 00:30:37,886
(Beixuan Inn)

367
00:30:54,160 --> 00:30:54,898
Your Highness.

368
00:30:55,640 --> 00:30:57,002
Your Highness.

369
00:30:57,680 --> 00:30:58,395
Your Highness.

370
00:31:03,359 --> 00:31:04,359
Your Highness.

371
00:31:04,520 --> 00:31:05,505
What's wrong with you?

372
00:31:06,400 --> 00:31:09,479
Didn't we give Qi Yuan Bao the Posuo Leaf last night?

373
00:31:09,760 --> 00:31:10,815
You should be happy.

374
00:31:20,479 --> 00:31:21,722
Don't tell me

375
00:31:22,037 --> 00:31:23,237
Qi Yuan Bao is dead.

376
00:31:23,350 --> 00:31:24,680
We're done for! Your soul...

377
00:31:24,760 --> 00:31:25,760
Tell me.

378
00:31:27,160 --> 00:31:28,442
You said that if she

379
00:31:30,640 --> 00:31:32,202
wanted to be close to me,

380
00:31:32,719 --> 00:31:33,719
touch me,

381
00:31:34,119 --> 00:31:34,874
or kiss me,

382
00:31:36,439 --> 00:31:38,082
the in-tandem cultivation would succeed.

383
00:31:39,520 --> 00:31:40,014
That's right.

384
00:31:41,719 --> 00:31:44,042
So why did I fail to take out the soul from her body?

385
00:31:44,239 --> 00:31:46,602
Your Highness. You went to retrieve your soul?

386
00:32:12,516 --> 00:32:13,599
(I knew it.)

387
00:32:13,746 --> 00:32:15,522
(She never liked me.)

388
00:32:19,119 --> 00:32:21,122
Your Highness, you see,

389
00:32:21,329 --> 00:32:23,602
humans are the hardest to fathom.

390
00:32:23,880 --> 00:32:25,560
While she looks like she wants to be close to you,

391
00:32:25,680 --> 00:32:27,112
touch you, or kiss you,

392
00:32:27,303 --> 00:32:28,722
it doesn't mean it's genuine.

393
00:32:28,826 --> 00:32:30,352
She can treat you like this today.

394
00:32:30,478 --> 00:32:32,522
But tomorrow, she might do the same to someone else.

395
00:32:32,765 --> 00:32:34,358
It doesn't mean she's truly in love.

396
00:32:34,514 --> 00:32:36,559
This is especially true for Qi Yuan Bao, who treats everything

397
00:32:36,749 --> 00:32:38,002
like a game.

398
00:32:38,239 --> 00:32:40,519
Think about it. Has she said what she said to you

399
00:32:40,645 --> 00:32:41,959
to another person?

400
00:32:42,171 --> 00:32:44,962
Has she done what she did to another person as well?

401
00:32:52,359 --> 00:32:53,359
Then...

402
00:32:54,680 --> 00:32:56,122
How do I

403
00:32:57,040 --> 00:32:59,002
make her truly fall for me?

404
00:32:59,129 --> 00:33:00,722
Qi Yuan Bao

405
00:33:01,760 --> 00:33:03,680
is definitely not like other girls.

406
00:33:03,893 --> 00:33:05,202
She's hard to win over.

407
00:33:05,479 --> 00:33:08,383
Your Highness, allow me to go and study this carefully.

408
00:33:08,599 --> 00:33:10,762
In the meantime, feel free to improvise.

409
00:33:14,880 --> 00:33:16,362
Wait a minute.

410
00:33:17,239 --> 00:33:18,562
Your Highness,

411
00:33:18,760 --> 00:33:20,802
did you mean

412
00:33:21,119 --> 00:33:22,962
you kissed Qi Yuan Bao again?

413
00:33:36,520 --> 00:33:37,642
(Qi Yuan Bao has recovered.)

414
00:33:37,800 --> 00:33:39,802
(She's fine now, but something's fishy.)

415
00:33:40,239 --> 00:33:42,160
Yuan Bao, slow down.

416
00:33:42,400 --> 00:33:43,432
You've just recovered.

417
00:33:43,520 --> 00:33:44,840
Wasn't I at Jingsi Cliff yesterday?

418
00:33:44,966 --> 00:33:46,846
How did I get back? Chang Yue brought me back?

419
00:33:47,327 --> 00:33:48,327
Chang Yue?

420
00:33:48,439 --> 00:33:49,439
What Chang Yue?

421
00:33:49,551 --> 00:33:51,264
I carried you back last night. Okay?

422
00:33:53,400 --> 00:33:54,802
You?

423
00:33:56,646 --> 00:33:59,088
Chang Yue never came here?

424
00:33:59,479 --> 00:34:00,487
Chang Yue?

425
00:34:01,520 --> 00:34:03,993
He should still be at Taiyi Mountain.

426
00:34:04,110 --> 00:34:05,177
Why would he be here?

427
00:34:06,855 --> 00:34:10,128
Was yesterday just a dream?

428
00:34:15,639 --> 00:34:17,082
Slow down.

429
00:34:17,273 --> 00:34:18,085
Yuan Bao.

430
00:34:21,645 --> 00:34:22,543
Slow down.

431
00:34:24,411 --> 00:34:25,436
This teacup fell over.

432
00:34:32,879 --> 00:34:33,778
It wasn't a dream.

433
00:34:34,063 --> 00:34:35,125
Chang Yue was here.

434
00:34:37,239 --> 00:34:37,814
Yuan Bao!

435
00:34:38,648 --> 00:34:40,362
What are you doing now?

436
00:34:40,615 --> 00:34:41,400
Seeking revenge.

437
00:34:42,665 --> 00:34:43,186
Wait for me!

438
00:35:07,639 --> 00:35:09,014
Hello. Excuse me.

439
00:35:09,150 --> 00:35:10,882
Have you seen this person?

440
00:35:11,130 --> 00:35:12,602
- No.   - No.

441
00:35:15,959 --> 00:35:18,922
Excuse me. Have you seen this man?

442
00:35:19,399 --> 00:35:20,399
- No.   - No.

443
00:35:25,479 --> 00:35:26,639
Hello. Excuse me.

444
00:35:26,788 --> 00:35:28,781
Have you seen this man?

445
00:35:28,846 --> 00:35:30,105
I think he's over there.

446
00:35:31,439 --> 00:35:32,618
Thank you.

447
00:35:38,040 --> 00:35:39,442
I...

448
00:35:43,600 --> 00:35:45,122
I found Mr. Chang Yue!

449
00:35:45,840 --> 00:35:47,602
- Where is he?   - There.
