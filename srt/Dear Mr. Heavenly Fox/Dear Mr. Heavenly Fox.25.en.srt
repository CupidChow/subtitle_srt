1
00:01:48,785 --> 00:01:53,972
(Dear Mr. Heavenly Fox)

2
00:01:54,059 --> 00:01:57,019
(Episode 25)

3
00:02:03,120 --> 00:02:05,604
Your aunt isn't here. Let's come back next time.

4
00:02:05,800 --> 00:02:06,401
Next time?

5
00:02:08,424 --> 00:02:09,173
What are you doing?

6
00:02:09,639 --> 00:02:11,392
If I want to get in, I get in.

7
00:02:11,536 --> 00:02:12,842
Yan Hong Zhen!

8
00:02:17,119 --> 00:02:18,593
He's a thief.

9
00:02:18,702 --> 00:02:20,162
Don't touch anything!

10
00:02:23,206 --> 00:02:23,805
It's over here.

11
00:02:50,520 --> 00:02:51,520
Prince Yan,

12
00:02:51,720 --> 00:02:52,989
you're looking for tomes.

13
00:02:53,070 --> 00:02:54,602
Can't you be a little gentler?

14
00:02:56,960 --> 00:02:59,012
Mind your own business. I'll do whatever I want.

15
00:03:10,960 --> 00:03:12,442
This is my father,

16
00:03:13,440 --> 00:03:14,440
my mother,

17
00:03:16,520 --> 00:03:17,873
and your aunt.

18
00:03:20,160 --> 00:03:22,163
How could the three of them be together?

19
00:03:26,240 --> 00:03:27,258
Could it be

20
00:03:27,842 --> 00:03:30,202
that the Meng Shu my father mentioned is her?

21
00:03:32,103 --> 00:03:33,587
Then the Tianji Jade Pendant

22
00:03:34,279 --> 00:03:35,674
should be in her hands.

23
00:03:36,543 --> 00:03:38,162
What are you mumbling about?

24
00:03:43,479 --> 00:03:44,127
Hi, madam.

25
00:03:44,737 --> 00:03:45,640
Miss Qi.

26
00:03:46,600 --> 00:03:47,600
Prince Yan.

27
00:03:47,880 --> 00:03:49,522
What are you doing in my chamber?

28
00:03:50,880 --> 00:03:54,362
We're just looking for some tomes about tandem cultivation.

29
00:03:57,432 --> 00:03:58,762
Did you find any?

30
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:04,993
These stupid tomes are useless.

31
00:04:06,602 --> 00:04:09,119
Since we found nothing, don't let us keep you.

32
00:04:09,237 --> 00:04:10,602
We'll take our leave.

33
00:04:11,919 --> 00:04:12,919
Put it down. Let's go.

34
00:04:13,039 --> 00:04:14,518
- Let's go.   - Why are we leaving?

35
00:04:14,640 --> 00:04:16,759
- Goodbye, madam.   - Can you stop touching me?

36
00:04:16,886 --> 00:04:18,082
Let's go.

37
00:04:24,440 --> 00:04:25,962
What have you been doing recently?

38
00:04:26,199 --> 00:04:27,682
Why haven't I seen you around?

39
00:04:29,799 --> 00:04:30,922
Chang Yue,

40
00:04:31,079 --> 00:04:34,602
do you remember the Meng Shu I mentioned before?

41
00:04:36,720 --> 00:04:38,322
If I'm not mistaken,

42
00:04:38,959 --> 00:04:41,322
the Meng Shu my father told me to be careful of

43
00:04:41,760 --> 00:04:43,162
is your aunt.

44
00:04:43,679 --> 00:04:44,679
My aunt?

45
00:04:44,799 --> 00:04:46,522
But my aunt's name is Xi Yu.

46
00:04:46,679 --> 00:04:48,999
Maybe Meng Shu

47
00:04:49,149 --> 00:04:51,122
is just her alias in the mortal realm.

48
00:04:51,320 --> 00:04:54,039
She probably was the one who framed you with Su Qing Mu

49
00:04:54,205 --> 00:04:55,602
using the Phantom Fox Darts.

50
00:04:56,079 --> 00:04:57,642
And she probably has

51
00:04:57,880 --> 00:04:59,442
my Tianji Jade Pendant too.

52
00:05:03,640 --> 00:05:05,042
Do you have any evidence?

53
00:05:11,760 --> 00:05:12,432
Chang Yue,

54
00:05:13,128 --> 00:05:16,033
do you have a spell that can turn me into someone else?

55
00:05:17,600 --> 00:05:18,618
Who do you want to become?

56
00:05:21,440 --> 00:05:23,153
Su Qing Mu.

57
00:05:23,920 --> 00:05:25,402
You want to become Su Qing Mu

58
00:05:25,679 --> 00:05:27,042
to trick my aunt?

59
00:05:54,279 --> 00:05:56,362
Chang Yue, how do I look?

60
00:05:56,752 --> 00:05:58,082
You look somewhat similar to him.

61
00:06:21,288 --> 00:06:22,611
Chang Yue,

62
00:06:23,279 --> 00:06:25,362
you seem a little nervous.

63
00:06:41,079 --> 00:06:43,870
Master, why don't you dare to look at me?

64
00:06:48,959 --> 00:06:50,642
I'm not used to this yet.

65
00:06:51,999 --> 00:06:53,482
Screw you, Chang Yue.

66
00:06:54,359 --> 00:06:56,547
You're such a superficial person.

67
00:06:56,652 --> 00:06:58,966
You only love my appearance. Isn't my soul interesting enough?

68
00:07:01,513 --> 00:07:02,649
Interesting.

69
00:07:02,783 --> 00:07:04,042
Very interesting.

70
00:07:06,799 --> 00:07:08,002
All right, Yuan Bao.

71
00:07:08,239 --> 00:07:09,239
Enough.

72
00:07:12,239 --> 00:07:13,962
Even you can't bear to look at me.

73
00:07:14,839 --> 00:07:16,482
It means it's good enough to fool anyone.

74
00:07:23,137 --> 00:07:25,242
You should eat more these days,

75
00:07:25,679 --> 00:07:27,033
because soon,

76
00:07:27,232 --> 00:07:29,282
Beiming will be in chaos,

77
00:07:29,760 --> 00:07:32,442
and you might not have anything to eat.

78
00:07:59,440 --> 00:08:02,473
Is Su Qing Mu going to attack Beiming?

79
00:08:13,200 --> 00:08:14,400
Why did you ask me to come here

80
00:08:14,480 --> 00:08:15,480
in the middle of the night?

81
00:08:15,600 --> 00:08:17,153
I already gave you the Tianji Jade Pendant.

82
00:08:17,480 --> 00:08:18,480
Why aren't you working on it?

83
00:08:18,760 --> 00:08:19,760
(Tianji Jade Pendant?)

84
00:08:20,279 --> 00:08:21,713
(So she did take it.)

85
00:08:22,880 --> 00:08:23,952
The Tianji Jade Pendant

86
00:08:25,320 --> 00:08:26,952
has already fallen into Qi Lian's hands.

87
00:08:28,519 --> 00:08:29,519
Qi Lian?

88
00:08:31,040 --> 00:08:32,592
You incompetent fool!

89
00:08:32,760 --> 00:08:34,352
What's the use of scolding me now?

90
00:08:34,534 --> 00:08:35,894
Qi Lian is an old fox.

91
00:08:35,919 --> 00:08:37,032
You know him well enough.

92
00:08:37,359 --> 00:08:39,599
He now knows that I killed those cultivators.

93
00:08:39,679 --> 00:08:40,839
How could he let me have

94
00:08:40,919 --> 00:08:41,953
the Tianji Jade Pendant?

95
00:08:42,119 --> 00:08:43,152
Then what are you doing here?

96
00:08:43,840 --> 00:08:46,273
Don't tell me you've become a loser

97
00:08:46,559 --> 00:08:48,193
who begs me for sympathy.

98
00:08:49,119 --> 00:08:50,479
I'm here to remind you

99
00:08:50,559 --> 00:08:52,039
that Qi Lian has already sent Qi Yuan Bao

100
00:08:52,119 --> 00:08:54,513
to Beiming to investigate the Phantom Fox Darts.

101
00:08:54,640 --> 00:08:55,959
Qi Yuan Bao is insidious and cunning.

102
00:08:56,039 --> 00:08:58,279
It won't be long before she finds out about you.

103
00:08:58,359 --> 00:09:00,639
If you're not careful, when the truth comes out,

104
00:09:00,719 --> 00:09:02,561
your clan will know that you orchestrated the incident

105
00:09:02,641 --> 00:09:03,712
and framed them for it.

106
00:09:03,960 --> 00:09:06,513
They will definitely banish you from Beiming.

107
00:09:07,960 --> 00:09:09,279
Do you think I'm as

108
00:09:09,359 --> 00:09:10,592
stupid as you are?

109
00:09:10,799 --> 00:09:12,393
I smuggled out the Phantom Fox Darts.

110
00:09:12,679 --> 00:09:14,193
I had already covered all my tracks.

111
00:09:14,599 --> 00:09:17,433
Qi Yuan Bao will never find out.

112
00:09:22,359 --> 00:09:23,639
Then do you know

113
00:09:23,719 --> 00:09:24,760
that the devil

114
00:09:24,840 --> 00:09:26,273
is always one step ahead?

115
00:09:32,359 --> 00:09:33,359
Qi Yuan Bao?

116
00:09:34,039 --> 00:09:35,472
You are indeed insidious and cunning.

117
00:09:36,200 --> 00:09:37,200
Thank you for the compliment.

118
00:09:37,840 --> 00:09:39,633
You colluded with that villain, Su Qing Mu,

119
00:09:39,880 --> 00:09:41,320
and used the Phantom Fox Darts

120
00:09:41,400 --> 00:09:42,753
to frame Beiming and Chang Yue.

121
00:09:42,878 --> 00:09:43,952
What exactly do you want?

122
00:09:44,400 --> 00:09:45,400
What exactly do I want?

123
00:09:45,880 --> 00:09:47,833
I want you and Qi Lian

124
00:09:48,039 --> 00:09:49,393
to never have peace.

125
00:10:00,080 --> 00:10:01,080
Are you okay?

126
00:10:02,960 --> 00:10:03,960
Grandmother Bi Xi.

127
00:10:04,239 --> 00:10:05,239
What are you doing here?

128
00:10:08,880 --> 00:10:09,959
You actually framed our clan

129
00:10:10,039 --> 00:10:11,039
and Chang Yue.

130
00:10:11,440 --> 00:10:12,833
You've disappointed me so much!

131
00:10:12,960 --> 00:10:15,313
Grandmother Bi Xi, this is all Qi Yuan Bao's scheme.

132
00:10:15,640 --> 00:10:16,800
You must not believe her!

133
00:10:16,880 --> 00:10:17,880
Shut up!

134
00:10:20,679 --> 00:10:21,792
The words you just said

135
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:23,993
came from your mouth.

136
00:10:24,119 --> 00:10:25,119
You can't deny that.

137
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:26,492
Tell me.

138
00:10:27,400 --> 00:10:28,633
Why did you do this?

139
00:10:29,200 --> 00:10:30,200
Why?

140
00:10:38,640 --> 00:10:41,433
It's so that Qi Lian's and Xue Yu Ying's child

141
00:10:41,760 --> 00:10:43,232
will suffer every day.

142
00:10:43,799 --> 00:10:45,112
You like Chang Yue, don't you?

143
00:10:45,440 --> 00:10:46,873
You want to be with him, don't you?

144
00:10:47,479 --> 00:10:48,833
I won't let you have your way.

145
00:10:49,119 --> 00:10:50,119
Qi Yuan Bao,

146
00:10:50,599 --> 00:10:51,753
as long as I'm here,

147
00:10:52,440 --> 00:10:54,232
you'll never have peace in this life.

148
00:10:54,320 --> 00:10:55,320
Never!

149
00:10:55,880 --> 00:10:57,993
What is your relationship with my parents?

150
00:10:58,359 --> 00:11:00,159
Don't compare me

151
00:11:00,239 --> 00:11:01,279
to that loose woman.

152
00:11:01,359 --> 00:11:02,433
Did you just insult my mother?

153
00:11:02,719 --> 00:11:03,719
- You...   - Yuan Bao.

154
00:11:04,853 --> 00:11:05,853
Aunt Xi Yu,

155
00:11:05,960 --> 00:11:06,960
just answer

156
00:11:07,239 --> 00:11:08,552
the question.

157
00:11:11,080 --> 00:11:12,193
Besides Xue Yu Ying,

158
00:11:12,679 --> 00:11:13,679
your father is also a

159
00:11:14,119 --> 00:11:16,232
hypocritical scumbag.

160
00:11:16,960 --> 00:11:19,592
Back then, me, him

161
00:11:19,880 --> 00:11:20,880
Xue Yu Ying,

162
00:11:21,239 --> 00:11:22,433
we were a trio of humans and fox.

163
00:11:22,880 --> 00:11:24,712
We wandered the world, upholding justice,

164
00:11:25,080 --> 00:11:27,440
subduing demons, and eliminating evil.

165
00:11:27,520 --> 00:11:28,592
How happy we were!

166
00:11:29,479 --> 00:11:30,672
We agreed to stay together

167
00:11:30,840 --> 00:11:31,873
for life.

168
00:11:32,880 --> 00:11:33,880
But little did I know,

169
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:37,433
your father betrayed me

170
00:11:37,880 --> 00:11:39,073
because I am a fox.

171
00:11:39,479 --> 00:11:40,833
He chose Xue Yu Ying.

172
00:11:41,960 --> 00:11:42,960
Those two

173
00:11:43,840 --> 00:11:45,592
deserve to die a thousand times!

174
00:11:49,032 --> 00:11:50,465
I've been with you for so many years.

175
00:11:51,479 --> 00:11:52,479
I never knew you had

176
00:11:52,520 --> 00:11:53,873
such a deep obsession in your heart.

177
00:11:54,520 --> 00:11:55,672
This thing called love

178
00:11:56,960 --> 00:11:58,112
is truly harmful.

179
00:11:58,840 --> 00:12:01,073
You're just talking nonsense.

180
00:12:01,320 --> 00:12:02,433
My father is a loyal man.

181
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:04,073
If he truly loved someone,

182
00:12:04,359 --> 00:12:05,993
why would he care about her race?

183
00:12:06,479 --> 00:12:08,240
I'm sure my father saw through

184
00:12:08,320 --> 00:12:10,119
your sinister and vicious nature,

185
00:12:10,239 --> 00:12:11,313
and simply didn't want you.

186
00:12:11,440 --> 00:12:12,440
What did you say?

187
00:12:12,599 --> 00:12:13,953
Enough. Stop talking.

188
00:12:15,599 --> 00:12:16,599
Meng Shu,

189
00:12:17,080 --> 00:12:18,232
for your own selfish desires,

190
00:12:18,479 --> 00:12:19,639
you harmed our clan

191
00:12:19,719 --> 00:12:20,873
and hurt Chang Yue.

192
00:12:21,080 --> 00:12:22,433
This is outrageous.

193
00:12:22,880 --> 00:12:23,880
Our clan

194
00:12:24,520 --> 00:12:25,873
cannot tolerate a traitor like you.

195
00:12:32,719 --> 00:12:33,753
Your spirit root is severed.

196
00:12:34,239 --> 00:12:36,592
You can no longer harm the humans.

197
00:12:37,119 --> 00:12:38,873
Considering our years of friendship,

198
00:12:39,331 --> 00:12:41,685
today, I banish you from Beiming,

199
00:12:42,200 --> 00:12:44,313
and you can never step foot here again.

200
00:12:45,719 --> 00:12:46,719
Leave.

201
00:13:01,559 --> 00:13:02,559
Qi Yuan Bao,

202
00:13:03,520 --> 00:13:04,520
one day,

203
00:13:05,719 --> 00:13:07,273
you will suffer unbearable pain.

204
00:13:10,799 --> 00:13:11,799
Wait.

205
00:13:15,479 --> 00:13:16,479
Where's Tianji Jade Pendant?

206
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:43,000
This is bad.

207
00:13:43,200 --> 00:13:44,592
I have bad news.

208
00:13:44,719 --> 00:13:45,993
What happened?

209
00:13:46,479 --> 00:13:47,792
Something happened in Luyun Town.

210
00:13:48,239 --> 00:13:49,633
A group of monsters appeared there,

211
00:13:50,400 --> 00:13:52,112
causing trouble everywhere.

212
00:13:53,640 --> 00:13:55,839
What are the characteristics of those monsters?

213
00:13:55,919 --> 00:13:57,313
They are neither human nor demon,

214
00:13:57,559 --> 00:13:59,313
and they seem to be controlled by someone.

215
00:13:59,599 --> 00:14:00,800
They have lost all humanity.

216
00:14:00,880 --> 00:14:02,472
Now, they are killing people everywhere,

217
00:14:02,666 --> 00:14:04,339
even their own relatives.

218
00:14:04,559 --> 00:14:06,120
- It's scary.   - Neither human nor demon?

219
00:14:06,200 --> 00:14:08,112
I have to leave quickly. You guys should run too.

220
00:14:09,760 --> 00:14:11,753
Can you tell me how to get to Luyun Town?

221
00:14:12,520 --> 00:14:14,873
Go southeast for about seven or eight lis, and you'll be there.

222
00:14:16,679 --> 00:14:18,193
Are you heading there?

223
00:14:19,733 --> 00:14:20,733
I'm leaving first.

224
00:14:21,880 --> 00:14:23,433
This sounds really creepy.

225
00:14:23,719 --> 00:14:24,719
Master,

226
00:14:24,799 --> 00:14:26,599
what do you think these monsters are?

227
00:14:28,692 --> 00:14:29,692
Let's go.

228
00:14:29,880 --> 00:14:31,193
We'll go to Luyun Town to take a look.

229
00:14:41,280 --> 00:14:43,440
Master, why isn't there anyone here?

230
00:14:43,520 --> 00:14:44,993
This town feels a bit off.

231
00:14:45,520 --> 00:14:46,833
There's a strong smell of blood.

232
00:14:52,919 --> 00:14:53,993
Split up and investigate.

233
00:14:54,280 --> 00:14:56,119
- Be careful.   - Noted.

234
00:14:59,799 --> 00:15:00,799
Let's go there.

235
00:15:03,159 --> 00:15:04,159
Help!

236
00:15:04,799 --> 00:15:05,799
Help!

237
00:15:08,359 --> 00:15:09,359
Help!

238
00:15:09,960 --> 00:15:10,960
Xue Han Yu!

239
00:15:11,679 --> 00:15:12,679
Help!

240
00:15:12,840 --> 00:15:13,840
Help!

241
00:15:18,679 --> 00:15:19,679
Come.

242
00:15:19,719 --> 00:15:20,719
Are you okay?

243
00:15:21,440 --> 00:15:22,638
Thank you.

244
00:15:29,239 --> 00:15:30,239
Uncle Qi.

245
00:15:39,840 --> 00:15:40,840
Xue Han Yu!

246
00:15:41,119 --> 00:15:42,119
Xue Han Yu.

247
00:15:44,280 --> 00:15:45,280
Are you okay?

248
00:15:45,840 --> 00:15:46,840
I'm okay.

249
00:16:08,119 --> 00:16:10,672
Master, these people have completely lost their minds.

250
00:16:10,919 --> 00:16:12,313
Someone must be controlling them.

251
00:16:15,839 --> 00:16:16,652
Uncle Qi.

252
00:16:17,159 --> 00:16:18,633
What are these things?

253
00:16:19,039 --> 00:16:20,039
Thralls.

254
00:16:20,960 --> 00:16:21,960
Thralls?

255
00:16:22,239 --> 00:16:23,239
Making thralls

256
00:16:23,320 --> 00:16:24,993
requires the Tianji Jade Pendant.

257
00:16:26,840 --> 00:16:27,840
Oh, no.

258
00:16:59,479 --> 00:17:00,479
Sit.

259
00:17:07,199 --> 00:17:08,199
Here.

260
00:17:14,439 --> 00:17:15,439
What is this?

261
00:17:15,479 --> 00:17:16,479
This is

262
00:17:17,959 --> 00:17:20,112
my family's most effective wound medicine.

263
00:17:30,079 --> 00:17:31,273
From now on,

264
00:17:31,880 --> 00:17:33,352
you should be dressing my wounds.

265
00:17:36,520 --> 00:17:37,520
Sure,

266
00:17:37,800 --> 00:17:39,633
if you beg me.

267
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:42,393
I might agree reluctantly.

268
00:17:46,839 --> 00:17:47,839
Fine.

269
00:17:50,439 --> 00:17:52,119
I beg you, Second Young Lady Su.

270
00:17:52,199 --> 00:17:53,199
Second Young Lady Su,

271
00:17:53,400 --> 00:17:54,712
I'm begging you.

272
00:17:56,479 --> 00:17:57,479
All right.

273
00:17:57,719 --> 00:17:59,439
Others don't get this kind of treatment.

274
00:18:00,959 --> 00:18:02,153
You need to cherish it,

275
00:18:02,400 --> 00:18:03,400
okay?

276
00:18:23,439 --> 00:18:25,273
Tell me if it hurts.

277
00:18:39,839 --> 00:18:40,839
Don't play the hero again.

278
00:18:55,359 --> 00:18:56,359
Xiao Hui,

279
00:18:56,640 --> 00:18:57,832
why haven't they returned yet?

280
00:18:58,719 --> 00:18:59,719
Xiao Hui.

281
00:19:00,119 --> 00:19:01,119
Master.

282
00:19:01,160 --> 00:19:02,160
What happened?

283
00:19:02,560 --> 00:19:03,560
Tian Ru Hua and Qi Liu

284
00:19:03,640 --> 00:19:04,720
haven't been here since dinner.

285
00:19:04,800 --> 00:19:06,153
I don't know where they went.

286
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:22,000
Qian Qian.

287
00:19:29,160 --> 00:19:30,160
Qian Qian.

288
00:20:24,359 --> 00:20:25,393
Xue Han Yu, what are you doing?

289
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:27,000
Xue Han Yu!

290
00:20:27,280 --> 00:20:29,119
Let go! Xue Han Yu!

291
00:20:32,079 --> 00:20:33,079
Xue Han Yu!

292
00:20:33,400 --> 00:20:34,873
Wake up! It's me, Su Qian Qian!

293
00:20:36,280 --> 00:20:37,880
- Stop!   - Yu!

294
00:20:38,319 --> 00:20:39,319
Xue Han Yu!

295
00:20:51,319 --> 00:20:53,080
Mr. Qi, why did Xue Han Yu become like this?

296
00:20:53,160 --> 00:20:54,279
How did he become a thrall?

297
00:20:54,359 --> 00:20:55,359
I...

298
00:20:55,520 --> 00:20:57,239
Could it be because he was bitten

299
00:20:57,319 --> 00:20:58,553
by that thrall?

300
00:20:59,479 --> 00:21:01,639
Mr. Qi, can you save him? I'm begging you.

301
00:21:01,719 --> 00:21:03,332
I will definitely find a way to save Yu.

302
00:21:09,145 --> 00:21:11,320
Sect Leader Qi, if you want to save Young Master Xue,

303
00:21:11,400 --> 00:21:12,400
I'm afraid the only way is...

304
00:21:14,479 --> 00:21:15,952
We'll talk after we find Yuan Bao.

305
00:21:20,319 --> 00:21:21,319
Xue Han Yu.

306
00:21:22,880 --> 00:21:23,880
Xue Han Yu.

307
00:21:26,239 --> 00:21:27,239
Don't be afraid.

308
00:21:27,479 --> 00:21:28,479
Mr. Qi

309
00:21:28,800 --> 00:21:30,153
will definitely find a way to save you.

310
00:21:38,719 --> 00:21:39,719
All right.

311
00:21:41,280 --> 00:21:42,873
If there's no cure,

312
00:21:43,880 --> 00:21:45,993
then I will reluctantly

313
00:21:46,599 --> 00:21:47,599
let you bite me.

314
00:21:49,793 --> 00:21:50,985
Either way,

315
00:21:52,218 --> 00:21:53,345
in this world,

316
00:21:53,920 --> 00:21:54,920
without you,

317
00:21:56,560 --> 00:21:57,633
I'm all alone.

318
00:22:00,400 --> 00:22:01,793
Although you're hideous now,

319
00:22:03,305 --> 00:22:04,579
I will take you.

320
00:22:07,439 --> 00:22:08,439
Xue Han Yu.

321
00:22:11,719 --> 00:22:12,719
Xue Han Yu!

322
00:22:17,640 --> 00:22:19,232
Can you please get better soon?

323
00:22:22,800 --> 00:22:23,800
I just lost my father,

324
00:22:26,680 --> 00:22:27,680
and my sister.

325
00:22:31,040 --> 00:22:32,753
I can't lose you too.

326
00:22:39,760 --> 00:22:41,793
Didn't you promise to take me to Qishan Sect?

327
00:22:45,760 --> 00:22:47,352
I hate liars the most.

328
00:22:55,239 --> 00:22:56,352
I'm begging you.

329
00:22:58,800 --> 00:23:00,273
Please get better soon, okay?

330
00:23:16,160 --> 00:23:18,072
I have never begged anyone before.

331
00:23:46,479 --> 00:23:47,479
Xue Han Yu?

332
00:23:49,560 --> 00:23:50,952
Xue Han Yu! Xue Han Yu!

333
00:23:54,280 --> 00:23:55,280
You're not ugly.

334
00:23:55,439 --> 00:23:56,439
Not at all.

335
00:23:56,680 --> 00:23:57,680
You are quite cute.

336
00:24:22,760 --> 00:24:23,760
All right.

337
00:24:25,439 --> 00:24:26,553
Good thing I was prepared.

338
00:24:27,760 --> 00:24:28,760
No teeth!

339
00:24:29,359 --> 00:24:30,359
Don't you bite me.

340
00:24:37,832 --> 00:24:38,618
Good boy.

341
00:24:39,239 --> 00:24:40,681
Thankfully, we have you

342
00:24:40,761 --> 00:24:42,153
who can take care of Xue.

343
00:24:42,760 --> 00:24:43,466
Miss Su,

344
00:24:44,079 --> 00:24:45,312
thank you for taking care of Yu.

345
00:24:45,640 --> 00:24:46,640
It's nothing, Mr. Qi.

346
00:24:46,719 --> 00:24:47,873
It's my duty.

347
00:24:52,959 --> 00:24:53,959
Let's continue.

348
00:24:54,591 --> 00:24:55,591
Let's go.

349
00:25:14,599 --> 00:25:15,599
Come.

350
00:25:21,560 --> 00:25:22,759
We are tired from the journey.

351
00:25:22,839 --> 00:25:24,153
Let's rest here for a while.

352
00:25:27,160 --> 00:25:28,160
Qi Huan,

353
00:25:28,640 --> 00:25:30,673
there's still no news of Tian Ru Hua and Qi Liu?

354
00:25:30,839 --> 00:25:31,993
I had the disciples

355
00:25:32,439 --> 00:25:33,553
search along the way,

356
00:25:33,839 --> 00:25:34,839
but...

357
00:25:42,680 --> 00:25:43,680
Get up now.

358
00:25:44,719 --> 00:25:45,719
Get up!

359
00:25:47,359 --> 00:25:48,359
Sect Leader Qi,

360
00:25:48,760 --> 00:25:50,119
do you think Tian Ru Hua and Qi Liu

361
00:25:50,199 --> 00:25:51,673
have become like Young Master Xue?

362
00:25:58,400 --> 00:25:59,400
Look at me.

363
00:25:59,520 --> 00:26:00,520
Look at me!

364
00:26:04,599 --> 00:26:05,753
Send more people to search.

365
00:26:06,520 --> 00:26:08,633
Report back immediately if they get anything.

366
00:26:08,839 --> 00:26:10,673
Okay, I'll arrange for it right away.

367
00:26:17,000 --> 00:26:18,000
Mr. Qi.

368
00:26:20,880 --> 00:26:21,880
Come.

369
00:26:22,280 --> 00:26:23,673
We'll go gather some firewood.

370
00:26:24,760 --> 00:26:26,519
Sure, but don't go too far.

371
00:26:26,599 --> 00:26:27,599
All right.

372
00:26:28,079 --> 00:26:28,492
Let's go.

373
00:26:29,813 --> 00:26:30,552
Let's go.

374
00:26:31,160 --> 00:26:31,592
Let's go.

375
00:26:34,119 --> 00:26:35,119
Come here.

376
00:26:42,560 --> 00:26:43,600
(Attention all disciples.)

377
00:26:43,680 --> 00:26:45,279
(If you have news of Tian Ru Hua and Qi Liu,)

378
00:26:45,359 --> 00:26:46,393
(report back immediately.)

379
00:26:52,959 --> 00:26:53,959
Xue Han Yu,

380
00:26:54,560 --> 00:26:55,800
if only you were this clingy

381
00:26:55,880 --> 00:26:57,192
when you weren't sick.

382
00:26:58,640 --> 00:26:59,640
Tell me.

383
00:26:59,839 --> 00:27:01,112
After we find Yuan Bao,

384
00:27:01,439 --> 00:27:03,393
will you stop being so clingy with me?

385
00:27:06,979 --> 00:27:08,212
I don't believe you.

386
00:27:08,686 --> 00:27:10,932
You only care about Yuan Bao.

387
00:27:11,520 --> 00:27:13,319
After we find her, you won't want me anymore.

388
00:27:16,546 --> 00:27:18,051
Xue Han Yu, I'm asking you a question.

389
00:27:21,753 --> 00:27:22,485
Xue Han Yu!

390
00:27:29,359 --> 00:27:30,800
Monster! Give me the fruit!

391
00:27:30,880 --> 00:27:32,312
He's a monster. Let's beat him up!

392
00:27:36,304 --> 00:27:37,403
Give it to us!

393
00:27:37,839 --> 00:27:38,839
- Give it to me!   - Stop!

394
00:27:40,560 --> 00:27:42,160
What are you doing? Back off!

395
00:27:42,280 --> 00:27:44,280
- Why are you bullying him?   - Run!

396
00:27:44,479 --> 00:27:45,479
Shoo!

397
00:27:46,479 --> 00:27:47,479
Why did you...

398
00:28:55,800 --> 00:28:56,913
You took a beating for this?

399
00:29:29,987 --> 00:29:31,560
It's so sour. You can have it.

400
00:30:05,365 --> 00:30:07,038
Your Highness!

401
00:30:07,359 --> 00:30:08,592
I found it!

402
00:30:08,719 --> 00:30:10,352
This tome talks about tandem cultivation.

403
00:30:15,199 --> 00:30:16,199
This...

404
00:30:16,400 --> 00:30:17,793
It's a fake lead again.

405
00:30:18,079 --> 00:30:19,553
We might as well try anything.

406
00:30:19,719 --> 00:30:20,719
I'll read it to you.

407
00:30:20,959 --> 00:30:22,232
The so-called tandem cultivation

408
00:30:22,479 --> 00:30:24,033
has two stages.

409
00:30:24,400 --> 00:30:25,472
The first stage is love.

410
00:30:26,040 --> 00:30:28,393
Find the destined one

411
00:30:28,680 --> 00:30:30,112
and make them like you,

412
00:30:30,319 --> 00:30:31,319
love you,

413
00:30:31,479 --> 00:30:33,673
and even give up their life for you.

414
00:30:33,820 --> 00:30:34,973
Then, the first stage is complete.

415
00:30:35,959 --> 00:30:37,472
The second stage is intimacy.

416
00:30:38,479 --> 00:30:40,153
Two people who love each other genuinely

417
00:30:40,359 --> 00:30:42,673
must be willing to consummate.

418
00:30:43,280 --> 00:30:45,072
Then, the intimacy stage is complete.

419
00:30:45,160 --> 00:30:46,432
So you need to consummate!

420
00:30:47,800 --> 00:30:49,312
Two stages of cultivation.

421
00:30:50,359 --> 00:30:52,840
So Chang Yue and I

422
00:30:52,920 --> 00:30:54,472
only completed one stage.

423
00:30:54,760 --> 00:30:56,200
What we need to do next

424
00:30:56,280 --> 00:30:57,280
is to consummate.

425
00:30:59,846 --> 00:31:00,846
But

426
00:31:01,079 --> 00:31:02,079
what is consummation?

427
00:31:02,599 --> 00:31:03,599
Right.

428
00:31:03,719 --> 00:31:04,719
What is consummation?

429
00:31:05,079 --> 00:31:06,079
I...

430
00:31:06,359 --> 00:31:08,393
Consummation is doing...

431
00:31:10,920 --> 00:31:12,393
Well, you know.

432
00:31:15,322 --> 00:31:16,673
- What?   - What?

433
00:31:18,980 --> 00:31:21,753
Miss Qi, you hang out at the House of Belle all the time.

434
00:31:21,920 --> 00:31:23,033
You must know, right?

435
00:31:24,599 --> 00:31:25,599
You mean...

436
00:31:25,800 --> 00:31:26,800
You mean...

437
00:31:34,839 --> 00:31:37,039
I think I got

438
00:31:37,119 --> 00:31:40,513
the rough idea.

439
00:31:41,839 --> 00:31:43,112
He doesn't know how to explain it.

440
00:31:43,439 --> 00:31:44,513
Can you teach me?

441
00:31:47,280 --> 00:31:47,798
You...

442
00:31:48,800 --> 00:31:50,440
Are you sure you want me to teach you?

443
00:31:50,520 --> 00:31:51,520
You don't want to?

444
00:31:51,560 --> 00:31:52,592
Of course, I want to.

445
00:31:53,800 --> 00:31:57,832
It's just that... I...

446
00:31:58,119 --> 00:31:59,119
I...

447
00:31:59,400 --> 00:32:00,639
I don't have much experience either.

448
00:32:00,719 --> 00:32:01,719
I have experience.

449
00:32:03,119 --> 00:32:05,119
Miss Qi, I'll write a manual for you right now.

450
00:32:05,199 --> 00:32:06,519
Then, you can teach His Highness.

451
00:32:06,599 --> 00:32:08,793
Today, let's consummate!

452
00:32:09,040 --> 00:32:10,040
Today?

453
00:32:10,160 --> 00:32:11,800
- This soon?   - This is quite slow already.

454
00:32:11,880 --> 00:32:12,993
I'll get paper and a brush now.

455
00:32:13,280 --> 00:32:14,280
Hu Bu Lin!

456
00:32:28,719 --> 00:32:29,719
Xiao Hui.

457
00:32:30,640 --> 00:32:31,640
What?

458
00:32:34,860 --> 00:32:35,860
You're back, Qian Qian.

459
00:32:38,800 --> 00:32:39,800
Where's the firewood?

460
00:32:41,920 --> 00:32:45,033
What firewood?

461
00:32:46,119 --> 00:32:47,352
I can't count on you at all.

462
00:32:48,439 --> 00:32:50,039
Self-reliance brings abundance.

463
00:32:50,119 --> 00:32:51,664
- I'll go with...   - No need.

464
00:32:51,744 --> 00:32:53,753
- I'll go with you.   - Xie, come with me.

465
00:32:54,520 --> 00:32:55,520
Let go.

466
00:33:09,000 --> 00:33:10,322
Qi Yuan Bao,

467
00:33:10,880 --> 00:33:14,673
thanks to you, I'm the way I am right now.

468
00:33:19,293 --> 00:33:21,922
How could I let you and Chang Yue

469
00:33:22,293 --> 00:33:23,996
live in peace?
