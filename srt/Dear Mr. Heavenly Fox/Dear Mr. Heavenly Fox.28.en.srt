1
00:01:48,738 --> 00:01:54,011
(Dear Mr. Heavenly Fox)

2
00:01:54,058 --> 00:01:57,045
(Episode 28)

3
00:01:59,160 --> 00:02:01,080
- Come.   - What's the matter?

4
00:02:01,160 --> 00:02:02,400
Don't worry. Have a seat first.

5
00:02:02,480 --> 00:02:02,993
Here.

6
00:02:07,239 --> 00:02:07,914
What is this?

7
00:02:08,479 --> 00:02:09,679
This is the creative drawing I made.

8
00:02:09,759 --> 00:02:12,080
I'm planning to propose to Qian Qian.

9
00:02:12,160 --> 00:02:13,793
What? So soon?

10
00:02:14,960 --> 00:02:15,960
Keep it down.

11
00:02:16,199 --> 00:02:17,267
If Qian Qian hears this,

12
00:02:17,720 --> 00:02:18,796
there won't be any surprise.

13
00:02:18,877 --> 00:02:19,957
You jerk!

14
00:02:20,038 --> 00:02:22,048
You forget about me once you find a wife.

15
00:02:22,387 --> 00:02:23,802
No, that won't happen.

16
00:02:24,039 --> 00:02:25,039
Help me take a look.

17
00:02:27,240 --> 00:02:28,752
How is it? Is it good?

18
00:02:35,905 --> 00:02:37,722
Your idea

19
00:02:38,039 --> 00:02:39,442
isn't that great.

20
00:02:39,590 --> 00:02:40,590
Change it.

21
00:02:42,421 --> 00:02:43,421
No way.

22
00:02:43,502 --> 00:02:44,731
I think it's great.

23
00:02:44,880 --> 00:02:46,327
What's so great about it?

24
00:02:46,479 --> 00:02:49,440
Your way of proposing is too old-fashioned. It's outdated, okay?

25
00:02:49,558 --> 00:02:51,785
Girls won't like it at all.

26
00:02:53,759 --> 00:02:55,049
Yuan Bao,

27
00:02:55,199 --> 00:02:57,280
are you sure you understand what girls want?

28
00:02:57,360 --> 00:02:58,360
I...

29
00:02:59,479 --> 00:03:02,032
Forget it. Go back and think of another plan.

30
00:03:02,118 --> 00:03:04,042
Go back and think.

31
00:03:04,720 --> 00:03:05,720
Go ahead.

32
00:03:05,800 --> 00:03:06,800
Okay.

33
00:03:14,080 --> 00:03:16,002
Not bad, Xue Han Yu.

34
00:03:17,320 --> 00:03:20,313
Since he gave it to me,

35
00:03:20,410 --> 00:03:22,162
I shall make use of it.

36
00:03:28,039 --> 00:03:29,632
My fellow seniors,

37
00:03:29,839 --> 00:03:32,319
my happiness is in your hands.

38
00:03:32,399 --> 00:03:34,959
So you must give it your all today, okay?

39
00:03:35,094 --> 00:03:36,522
- Okay.   - Good!

40
00:03:36,919 --> 00:03:38,080
Start the music.

41
00:03:38,245 --> 00:03:39,357
Come.

42
00:04:01,320 --> 00:04:02,922
She's doing something ridiculous again.

43
00:04:14,972 --> 00:04:15,972
Why hasn't he come out yet?

44
00:04:16,226 --> 00:04:17,226
Stop!

45
00:04:21,440 --> 00:04:22,245
Chang Yue.

46
00:04:24,306 --> 00:04:25,306
Chang Yue.

47
00:04:27,200 --> 00:04:28,082
Chang Yue!

48
00:04:28,838 --> 00:04:30,442
Come out, Chang Yue!

49
00:04:31,519 --> 00:04:32,602
Chang Yue!

50
00:04:33,040 --> 00:04:35,202
Come out, Chang Yue!

51
00:04:39,126 --> 00:04:40,446
- Keep playing.   - Come.

52
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:48,560
Didn't you say you'd give me a surprise?

53
00:04:48,749 --> 00:04:49,806
When is it?

54
00:04:50,526 --> 00:04:53,482
Surprises always take time to prepare.

55
00:04:53,920 --> 00:04:55,002
See this?

56
00:04:55,267 --> 00:04:56,981
I'll give you two days at most

57
00:04:57,077 --> 00:04:58,077
or I'll kill you!

58
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:00,000
All right.

59
00:05:00,160 --> 00:05:02,002
I'll definitely make you happy then.

60
00:05:02,200 --> 00:05:03,200
It better be.

61
00:05:05,440 --> 00:05:06,873
What's all that noise over there?

62
00:05:08,640 --> 00:05:10,680
Could it be... Let's go.

63
00:05:10,830 --> 00:05:11,830
Let's check it out.

64
00:05:16,160 --> 00:05:17,522
Louder!

65
00:05:21,775 --> 00:05:23,562
Chang Yue! Stop!

66
00:05:44,488 --> 00:05:47,242
- What are you doing?   - Chang Yue, marry me!

67
00:05:47,480 --> 00:05:53,800
Marry her!

68
00:05:53,987 --> 00:05:58,482
Marry her!

69
00:06:13,203 --> 00:06:14,203
Wait!

70
00:06:14,597 --> 00:06:16,522
Let me through. Hold on.

71
00:06:17,261 --> 00:06:18,597
Isn't this my idea?

72
00:06:18,790 --> 00:06:20,402
Yuan Bao, you plagiarized my idea!

73
00:06:20,640 --> 00:06:22,120
Shut up. Finder's keeper.

74
00:06:22,238 --> 00:06:23,758
- But...   - Xue Han Yu!

75
00:06:23,839 --> 00:06:24,999
Your cousin is a thief.

76
00:06:25,125 --> 00:06:27,649
- I want something better!   - Okay.

77
00:06:28,359 --> 00:06:30,042
Chang Yue, I mean it.

78
00:06:30,246 --> 00:06:31,246
Marry me.

79
00:06:50,722 --> 00:06:52,962
Wait! Give me your hand.

80
00:07:08,263 --> 00:07:11,082
Great! From now on, you're mine.

81
00:07:23,464 --> 00:07:24,464
Yuan Bao.

82
00:07:31,279 --> 00:07:32,522
From now on,

83
00:07:33,201 --> 00:07:34,562
I'm your responsibility.

84
00:07:53,352 --> 00:07:54,352
Hi, beautiful.

85
00:07:58,175 --> 00:07:59,442
Su Qian Qian.

86
00:08:06,513 --> 00:08:08,305
Don't be mad at Yuan Bao anymore.

87
00:08:10,947 --> 00:08:11,657
I promise you

88
00:08:12,230 --> 00:08:14,503
I'll definitely give you an even bigger

89
00:08:14,703 --> 00:08:16,242
and better surprise. How's that?

90
00:08:29,640 --> 00:08:31,522
Wild chrysanthemums won't appease me.

91
00:08:32,108 --> 00:08:34,310
As long as you like them, whether it's honeysuckle, chrysanthemums,

92
00:08:34,431 --> 00:08:36,682
or even man-eating flowers, I'll find them for you.

93
00:08:37,479 --> 00:08:38,762
Are you serious?

94
00:08:38,880 --> 00:08:39,880
Of course!

95
00:08:40,559 --> 00:08:41,839
I absolutely mean what I say.

96
00:08:41,965 --> 00:08:43,518
If I don't,

97
00:08:44,320 --> 00:08:47,069
you'll never talk to me or see me again.

98
00:08:47,150 --> 00:08:48,402
How's that?

99
00:08:49,679 --> 00:08:50,679
Deal.

100
00:08:50,958 --> 00:08:53,831
If you lie to me, I'll never talk to you

101
00:08:53,919 --> 00:08:55,162
for real again.

102
00:09:21,392 --> 00:09:25,554
Chang Yue, in the near future, let's get married.

103
00:09:26,559 --> 00:09:27,559
Okay.

104
00:09:28,640 --> 00:09:32,152
How many babies do you think we'll have?

105
00:09:33,558 --> 00:09:35,002
You're a fox.

106
00:09:35,359 --> 00:09:38,322
Does that mean the babies I have will be fox babies too?

107
00:09:39,520 --> 00:09:40,842
It's my first time as well.

108
00:09:41,840 --> 00:09:42,673
That's true.

109
00:09:42,942 --> 00:09:45,336
If you're already a father, I'd be in trouble.

110
00:09:47,655 --> 00:09:49,642
Then after we have kids,

111
00:09:49,730 --> 00:09:52,393
should we live in Beiming or at Qishan Sect?

112
00:09:55,599 --> 00:09:57,282
Half a year in Beiming,

113
00:09:57,520 --> 00:09:58,762
half a year at Qishan Sect.

114
00:09:58,880 --> 00:09:59,880
What do you think?

115
00:10:00,015 --> 00:10:01,402
I think that's great.

116
00:10:02,337 --> 00:10:06,032
But will Grandmother Bi Xi accept me?

117
00:10:06,243 --> 00:10:08,197
Will she kick me out of Beiming?

118
00:10:08,301 --> 00:10:09,301
No.

119
00:10:09,640 --> 00:10:11,399
Don't let Grandmother Bi Xi's sternness fool you.

120
00:10:11,525 --> 00:10:12,879
She's actually soft on the inside.

121
00:10:13,014 --> 00:10:14,014
In her heart,

122
00:10:15,106 --> 00:10:16,642
she's already accepted you.

123
00:10:17,363 --> 00:10:18,363
That's good.

124
00:10:20,232 --> 00:10:21,502
Chang Yue,

125
00:10:21,840 --> 00:10:23,842
I feel so happy right now.

126
00:10:24,664 --> 00:10:25,987
We

127
00:10:26,512 --> 00:10:28,762
should be together in the next life too, right?

128
00:10:32,559 --> 00:10:33,922
We definitely will be.

129
00:10:55,050 --> 00:10:56,282
Done.

130
00:10:56,440 --> 00:10:57,682
Please check.

131
00:11:06,359 --> 00:11:07,802
How is it, darling?

132
00:11:08,080 --> 00:11:10,922
Has your wife's handwriting improved significantly?

133
00:11:11,960 --> 00:11:13,642
There's still a lot of room for improvement.

134
00:11:13,960 --> 00:11:15,402
I hope after we're married,

135
00:11:15,840 --> 00:11:17,433
you will practice your calligraphy diligently.

136
00:11:19,559 --> 00:11:22,082
To think I, a carefree spirit,

137
00:11:22,194 --> 00:11:25,162
was tamed by a tutor...

138
00:11:27,039 --> 00:11:29,012
It's not too late to regret it now.

139
00:11:29,599 --> 00:11:32,002
Chang Yue, don't tell me you're the one regretting it.

140
00:11:33,200 --> 00:11:34,019
Practice your calligraphy.

141
00:11:39,518 --> 00:11:40,170
Qian Qian,

142
00:11:40,599 --> 00:11:43,073
do you think Yuan Bao's and Chang Yue's children

143
00:11:43,320 --> 00:11:45,759
will live in Qishan Sect or Beiming?

144
00:11:45,863 --> 00:11:47,242
In Beiming, of course.

145
00:11:47,400 --> 00:11:48,833
Beiming is a great place.

146
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:50,322
Unlike your Qishan Sect

147
00:11:50,613 --> 00:11:52,887
where the children born are all country bumpkins.

148
00:11:53,080 --> 00:11:54,760
Qishan Sect is a place of outstanding talents,

149
00:11:54,918 --> 00:11:57,482
and the children born here resemble immortals.

150
00:11:57,719 --> 00:11:58,833
Immortals?

151
00:11:59,280 --> 00:12:01,440
The children born in Qishan Sect are like barbarians.

152
00:12:01,520 --> 00:12:02,520
Like that one.

153
00:12:06,080 --> 00:12:07,080
Qian Qian,

154
00:12:07,159 --> 00:12:08,479
something's on your mouth.

155
00:12:08,559 --> 00:12:10,200
Come, I'll wipe it for you.

156
00:12:16,520 --> 00:12:17,552
You look much prettier now.

157
00:12:24,799 --> 00:12:26,338
Xue Han Yu!

158
00:12:26,860 --> 00:12:27,860
Grandmother Bi Xi!

159
00:12:28,479 --> 00:12:29,479
Grandmother Bi Xi!

160
00:12:29,559 --> 00:12:31,279
Something terrible has happened!

161
00:12:31,359 --> 00:12:32,359
What happened?

162
00:12:32,520 --> 00:12:33,719
We lost our Beiming treasure

163
00:12:33,799 --> 00:12:35,112
to a mortal.

164
00:12:35,679 --> 00:12:36,679
Look!

165
00:12:41,479 --> 00:12:42,633
Unreasonable!

166
00:12:43,159 --> 00:12:44,159
Unreasonable!

167
00:12:44,599 --> 00:12:46,513
Chang Yue is a heavenly fox.

168
00:12:46,679 --> 00:12:48,433
How can he be married into someone else's family?

169
00:12:50,239 --> 00:12:52,032
You're right. This is not right.

170
00:12:52,440 --> 00:12:53,284
Quickly arrange for us

171
00:12:53,464 --> 00:12:54,812
to set off for Qishan Sect.

172
00:12:55,320 --> 00:12:57,273
I want to have a good talk with this Qi Lian.

173
00:12:57,559 --> 00:12:58,758
They are organizing a wedding.

174
00:12:59,320 --> 00:13:01,833
Where is our betrothal gift then?

175
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:03,919
Is Chang Yue not worthy of it?

176
00:13:04,200 --> 00:13:05,399
- Right.   - Grandmother Bi Xi.

177
00:13:05,479 --> 00:13:07,279
Grandmother Bi Xi, Qishan Sect

178
00:13:07,359 --> 00:13:08,873
has come to deliver the betrothal gifts.

179
00:13:40,320 --> 00:13:42,200
Qishan Sect, a cultivation sect in the mortal realm,

180
00:13:42,280 --> 00:13:43,352
has come with betrothal gifts.

181
00:13:45,880 --> 00:13:47,592
Betrothal money, one thousand taels of silver.

182
00:13:47,880 --> 00:13:49,032
Betrothal cakes, two dan.

183
00:13:49,520 --> 00:13:50,633
Eight kinds of seafood.

184
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:52,232
Wedding invitation card chests.

185
00:13:52,719 --> 00:13:54,313
Countless jewels and jadeware.

186
00:13:57,119 --> 00:13:58,792
Qi Huan,

187
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:01,032
on behalf of Qi Yuan Bao, the heiress of Qishan Sect,

188
00:14:01,400 --> 00:14:03,112
formally asks for Chang Yue's hand in marriage.

189
00:14:03,640 --> 00:14:05,592
We seek your approval, Grandmother Bi Xi.

190
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:08,792
The entire Qishan Sect shall be extremely grateful.

191
00:14:14,159 --> 00:14:15,193
Fine, I agree.

192
00:14:16,320 --> 00:14:17,712
Thank you for your blessing.

193
00:14:19,005 --> 00:14:20,719
Pass on a message to Qi Yuan Bao for me.

194
00:14:21,160 --> 00:14:22,160
Sure, Grandmother Bi Xi.

195
00:14:22,440 --> 00:14:23,440
In the future,

196
00:14:23,587 --> 00:14:25,419
if she bullies Chang Yue,

197
00:14:26,200 --> 00:14:27,753
even if I'll die,

198
00:14:28,440 --> 00:14:30,273
I will definitely make her pay.

199
00:14:32,760 --> 00:14:33,760
Understood.

200
00:15:22,400 --> 00:15:23,400
I am hungry.

201
00:15:30,559 --> 00:15:31,680
These are dumplings that Miss Qi

202
00:15:31,760 --> 00:15:33,273
especially froze before she left.

203
00:16:07,400 --> 00:16:08,400
I don't like them.

204
00:16:10,760 --> 00:16:12,513
Didn't you use to like them?

205
00:16:25,039 --> 00:16:25,908
Qi Yuan Bao.

206
00:16:26,479 --> 00:16:28,320
Look at this one. What do you think?

207
00:16:29,836 --> 00:16:31,175
What kind of taste do you have?

208
00:16:31,206 --> 00:16:32,216
This one is so cliche.

209
00:16:32,479 --> 00:16:33,479
It suits me.

210
00:16:34,080 --> 00:16:35,912
Yes, you're getting married.

211
00:16:36,053 --> 00:16:37,053
You're the boss.

212
00:16:37,213 --> 00:16:37,668
I...

213
00:16:38,520 --> 00:16:39,614
You wouldn't understand anyway.

214
00:16:45,840 --> 00:16:47,513
This one is not bad.

215
00:16:49,640 --> 00:16:51,032
It's both beautiful and elegant.

216
00:16:51,200 --> 00:16:52,200
I like it.

217
00:16:53,006 --> 00:16:54,006
This one?

218
00:16:54,599 --> 00:16:56,433
It's so bland.

219
00:16:56,960 --> 00:16:58,912
What do you know? Chang Yue likes this.

220
00:16:59,159 --> 00:17:00,560
Right. Chang Yue likes something bland.

221
00:17:00,640 --> 00:17:01,640
I...

222
00:17:01,919 --> 00:17:03,032
What does Xue Han Yu see in you?

223
00:17:21,185 --> 00:17:22,499
This one and this one.

224
00:17:23,439 --> 00:17:25,352
This, this, this,

225
00:17:25,680 --> 00:17:26,680
and...

226
00:17:27,160 --> 00:17:28,160
this

227
00:17:28,239 --> 00:17:29,913
are all Yuan Bao's favorite dishes.

228
00:17:31,239 --> 00:17:32,832
As for this one and this one,

229
00:17:33,239 --> 00:17:34,673
she won't even look at them.

230
00:17:34,880 --> 00:17:36,273
So? Can you remember everything?

231
00:17:37,573 --> 00:17:38,573
Yes.

232
00:17:40,640 --> 00:17:42,319
Mr. Chang Yue, don't forget that.

233
00:17:44,119 --> 00:17:45,119
Oh, right.

234
00:17:45,199 --> 00:17:46,753
Yuan Bao usually only uses the fabrics

235
00:17:46,880 --> 00:17:48,432
from this store for her robes.

236
00:17:49,079 --> 00:17:50,913
She uses this in the summer,

237
00:17:51,160 --> 00:17:53,153
and this kind in the winter.

238
00:17:54,560 --> 00:17:55,560
So Mr. Chang Yue,

239
00:17:55,599 --> 00:17:56,599
can you remember that?

240
00:17:57,359 --> 00:17:58,359
Yes.

241
00:18:11,479 --> 00:18:12,712
Don't get the wrong idea.

242
00:18:12,959 --> 00:18:15,153
Yuan Bao never reads these kinds of books.

243
00:18:15,880 --> 00:18:18,793
She prefers to read books that are more elegant

244
00:18:18,959 --> 00:18:20,393
and profound.

245
00:18:23,280 --> 00:18:24,592
That's something to look forward to.

246
00:18:25,319 --> 00:18:25,950
This way, please.

247
00:18:33,455 --> 00:18:34,535
These are the books

248
00:18:34,579 --> 00:18:36,172
Yuan Bao loves to read.

249
00:18:41,185 --> 00:18:42,458
(Dear Mr. Heavenly Fox)

250
00:18:45,079 --> 00:18:45,733
What do you think?

251
00:18:50,359 --> 00:18:51,359
Very relatable.

252
00:19:00,239 --> 00:19:02,359
You really like it a lot.

253
00:19:02,439 --> 00:19:04,159
What? Want to get married?

254
00:19:04,240 --> 00:19:05,406
Go to hell. No, I don't.

255
00:19:06,319 --> 00:19:07,399
Just admit it.

256
00:19:07,479 --> 00:19:08,753
Don't be shy.

257
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:11,993
You can only get married if someone wants to marry you.

258
00:19:12,599 --> 00:19:13,712
Why don't you learn from me

259
00:19:13,839 --> 00:19:14,839
and be more proactive?

260
00:19:15,239 --> 00:19:17,232
Sorry, I don't have such thick skin.

261
00:19:18,160 --> 00:19:19,721
Just you wait. One day,

262
00:19:19,801 --> 00:19:21,119
I will put on this wedding dress

263
00:19:21,199 --> 00:19:22,553
and marry the person I love the most.

264
00:19:23,479 --> 00:19:24,479
What are you guys looking at?

265
00:19:25,839 --> 00:19:26,913
- Xue Han Yu.   - Chang Yue.

266
00:19:27,079 --> 00:19:28,079
Chang Yue.

267
00:19:29,280 --> 00:19:30,280
Su Qian Qian.

268
00:19:32,199 --> 00:19:34,153
How do you know I like to eat Li's candied hawthorns?

269
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:40,153
- Have you chosen yet?   - You'll know when the time comes.

270
00:19:40,760 --> 00:19:41,760
Look at them.

271
00:19:43,959 --> 00:19:45,680
She's angry. No one's buying you food? Eat mine.

272
00:19:45,760 --> 00:19:46,760
Take it.

273
00:19:46,839 --> 00:19:47,839
Let's go tease her.

274
00:19:49,520 --> 00:19:50,520
What is going on?

275
00:20:00,599 --> 00:20:02,279
It's just a candied hawthorn.

276
00:20:02,359 --> 00:20:03,553
I'll buy you one, okay?

277
00:20:23,239 --> 00:20:24,480
Sect Leader Qi, congratulations.

278
00:20:24,560 --> 00:20:25,759
- Thank you.   - Congratulations.

279
00:20:25,839 --> 00:20:27,680
- Please come in.   - This way, please.

280
00:20:27,760 --> 00:20:29,439
Thank you, Wu. Come in.

281
00:20:30,319 --> 00:20:31,319
Congratulations.

282
00:20:31,359 --> 00:20:33,359
- What a joyous occasion!   - Thank you.

283
00:20:33,439 --> 00:20:35,159
Today is a joyous day for Qishan Sect.

284
00:20:35,239 --> 00:20:37,119
We've prepared some simple wine and food. Please forgive

285
00:20:37,199 --> 00:20:38,759
- our simple reception.   - Come in.

286
00:20:38,839 --> 00:20:40,639
- Please come in!   - Sect Leader Qi.

287
00:20:40,719 --> 00:20:41,719
- Wu.   - Congratulations!

288
00:20:41,799 --> 00:20:42,799
Thank you.

289
00:20:44,599 --> 00:20:46,352
Qi Huan, how is Yuan Bao doing?

290
00:20:46,520 --> 00:20:48,279
Sir, Young Lady has already set off

291
00:20:48,359 --> 00:20:49,519
to pick up Mr. Chang Yue.

292
00:20:49,599 --> 00:20:51,002
- Good.   - Sect Leader Qi.

293
00:20:51,155 --> 00:20:52,414
- Wu.   - Congratulations!

294
00:20:52,439 --> 00:20:54,072
- Thank you.   - Please come in.

295
00:20:54,719 --> 00:20:56,080
Sect Leader Qi, congratulations.

296
00:20:56,105 --> 00:20:57,745
Thank you.

297
00:21:12,839 --> 00:21:14,273
Thank you!

298
00:21:38,313 --> 00:21:40,362
(Wedding)

299
00:21:48,882 --> 00:21:54,719
(Beixuan Inn)

300
00:22:00,379 --> 00:22:02,466
(Beixuan Inn)

301
00:22:04,599 --> 00:22:05,753
Today, I

302
00:22:05,839 --> 00:22:07,080
will definitely marry

303
00:22:07,160 --> 00:22:08,352
Chang Yue in style!

304
00:22:08,680 --> 00:22:09,680
Brothers and sisters,

305
00:22:09,920 --> 00:22:10,920
charge!

306
00:22:11,359 --> 00:22:12,359
Charge!

307
00:22:31,680 --> 00:22:32,680
Charge!

308
00:22:33,040 --> 00:22:34,040
Charge.

309
00:22:34,199 --> 00:22:36,079
- Chang Yue!   - Keep going!

310
00:22:36,599 --> 00:22:37,680
- Charge!   - Don't push!

311
00:22:37,760 --> 00:22:38,760
Hurry up!

312
00:22:39,560 --> 00:22:40,879
Chang Yue, come out.

313
00:22:40,959 --> 00:22:42,920
Hurry! We're here to pick you up, Chang Yue!

314
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:44,673
- Mr. Chang Yue!   - Rush in.

315
00:22:44,839 --> 00:22:45,839
Mr. Chang Yue!

316
00:22:45,920 --> 00:22:47,279
Use your strength! Push harder!

317
00:22:47,359 --> 00:22:49,160
Push! Use your strength!

318
00:22:49,240 --> 00:22:50,673
Chang Yue!

319
00:22:51,079 --> 00:22:52,232
- Chang Yue.   - Keep pushing.

320
00:22:52,680 --> 00:22:53,680
Chang Yue!

321
00:22:54,079 --> 00:22:55,279
- Keep pushing.   - Come out!

322
00:22:55,359 --> 00:22:56,359
Charge!

323
00:22:56,560 --> 00:22:57,759
- Give it your all!   - So noisy!

324
00:22:57,839 --> 00:22:58,839
Come out, Chang Yue!

325
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:00,759
- Chang Yue, come out!   - I'll do it.

326
00:23:00,839 --> 00:23:02,832
- Chang Yue!   - Use your strength!

327
00:23:03,239 --> 00:23:04,239
Chang Yue!

328
00:23:04,359 --> 00:23:05,999
- Back up a bit.   - Chang Yue!

329
00:23:06,079 --> 00:23:07,760
- Use your strength.   - Chang Yue!

330
00:23:07,959 --> 00:23:09,952
- My hand!   - Come out, Chang Yue!

331
00:23:11,359 --> 00:23:12,359
Push!

332
00:23:12,719 --> 00:23:13,719
Chang Yue!

333
00:23:13,839 --> 00:23:15,952
- Use your strength!   - Push!

334
00:23:20,712 --> 00:23:21,712
Mr. Chang Yue!

335
00:23:22,160 --> 00:23:23,160
- Mr. Chang Yue!   - Push!

336
00:23:23,239 --> 00:23:24,239
Give it your all!

337
00:23:24,520 --> 00:23:25,639
Go! Push hard!

338
00:23:25,719 --> 00:23:27,119
All of you, give it your all!

339
00:23:27,199 --> 00:23:28,639
- Let me in!   - Push!

340
00:23:28,719 --> 00:23:31,393
- Are you ever going to stop?   - Mr. Chang Yue!

341
00:23:31,959 --> 00:23:33,560
Give it your all! Push!

342
00:23:33,640 --> 00:23:35,393
- Back off!   - Come out, Chang Yue!

343
00:23:42,199 --> 00:23:43,753
You think you can break through my door?

344
00:23:44,800 --> 00:23:45,800
Dream on!

345
00:23:49,199 --> 00:23:51,399
Grandmaster, please be kind.

346
00:23:51,479 --> 00:23:53,352
Just let me marry him today.

347
00:23:58,359 --> 00:23:59,433
Tian Ru Hua, come here!

348
00:24:00,246 --> 00:24:00,863
Okay.

349
00:24:03,280 --> 00:24:04,913
Mr. Yan,

350
00:24:05,160 --> 00:24:06,592
please be kind!

351
00:24:06,959 --> 00:24:08,279
Look how eager Yuan Bao is.

352
00:24:08,359 --> 00:24:09,832
She's so impatient.

353
00:24:09,959 --> 00:24:11,800
She can't wait even a moment longer.

354
00:24:11,880 --> 00:24:12,880
That's right.

355
00:24:15,760 --> 00:24:16,760
Please accept this.

356
00:24:17,280 --> 00:24:19,119
- What is this thing?   - It's a red envelope.

357
00:24:19,479 --> 00:24:20,479
I don't want it.

358
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:23,153
- Grandmaster.   - Yuan Bao!

359
00:24:23,239 --> 00:24:24,239
If this keeps up,

360
00:24:24,319 --> 00:24:25,592
the auspicious time will pass.

361
00:24:26,199 --> 00:24:27,879
Indeed. If we miss the auspicious time,

362
00:24:27,959 --> 00:24:29,399
it will ruin the marriage.

363
00:24:29,479 --> 00:24:31,000
Right. Don't jinx it.

364
00:24:32,112 --> 00:24:34,840
Grandmaster, please.

365
00:24:34,920 --> 00:24:36,519
Grandmaster!

366
00:24:36,599 --> 00:24:38,320
Grandmaster!

367
00:24:38,400 --> 00:24:40,273
Grandmaster, please.

368
00:24:41,126 --> 00:24:43,119
Grandmaster, please.

369
00:24:43,206 --> 00:24:44,767
- Grandmaster!   - Please!

370
00:25:23,400 --> 00:25:24,432
I've come to pick you up.

371
00:25:39,405 --> 00:25:41,398
(Lingxiao Hall)

372
00:25:42,479 --> 00:25:44,112
May the bride and groom enter.

373
00:26:02,439 --> 00:26:03,439
(Chang Yue.)

374
00:26:05,319 --> 00:26:06,765
(I entrust my beloved daughter)

375
00:26:09,280 --> 00:26:10,753
(into your hands.)

376
00:26:13,019 --> 00:26:14,333
(I hope you will love her,)

377
00:26:15,040 --> 00:26:17,072
(cherish her,)

378
00:26:17,520 --> 00:26:18,520
(and protect her as I do.)

379
00:26:20,119 --> 00:26:21,312
(Grow old with her)

380
00:26:22,920 --> 00:26:24,553
(and stay with her.)

381
00:26:29,800 --> 00:26:30,800
Yuan Bao,

382
00:26:32,160 --> 00:26:33,160
in this life,

383
00:26:34,160 --> 00:26:36,993
I will follow you to the end of the universe..

384
00:26:38,719 --> 00:26:40,232
It wasn't easy for us to be together.

385
00:26:41,680 --> 00:26:42,712
I, Chang Yue, swear

386
00:26:45,000 --> 00:26:46,000
that I will not let you down,

387
00:26:47,359 --> 00:26:49,072
that I will protect you life after life,

388
00:26:50,800 --> 00:26:52,432
and that I love you life after life.

389
00:26:56,680 --> 00:27:00,312
I only wish to hold your hand

390
00:27:01,640 --> 00:27:02,753
and grow old with you.

391
00:27:32,239 --> 00:27:33,239
Xue Han Yu.

392
00:27:33,920 --> 00:27:36,312
Don't cry. It's bad luck to cry on such a happy day.

393
00:27:38,319 --> 00:27:39,553
You may perform the rites.

394
00:27:41,640 --> 00:27:43,432
First bow to heaven and earth!

395
00:28:37,802 --> 00:28:39,242
(Wedding)

396
00:29:08,439 --> 00:29:10,359
Yuan Bao, go back.

397
00:29:10,520 --> 00:29:12,079
He'll be right here. Just be patient.

398
00:29:19,118 --> 00:29:20,118
Yuan Bao.

399
00:29:20,414 --> 00:29:21,414
Don't take off the veil yet.

400
00:29:21,439 --> 00:29:23,112
No taking off the veil before the auspicious time.

401
00:29:23,145 --> 00:29:25,256
It's been so long. I'm about to be suffocated!

402
00:29:25,281 --> 00:29:26,712
Who cares about the auspicious time?

403
00:29:27,160 --> 00:29:28,553
Why isn't Chang Yue here yet?

404
00:29:29,359 --> 00:29:30,993
Please be patient.

405
00:29:31,520 --> 00:29:32,873
Hui, I'm hungry.

406
00:29:34,199 --> 00:29:35,199
Hungry?

407
00:29:36,800 --> 00:29:37,800
Hungry?

408
00:29:40,359 --> 00:29:41,513
Here, have this first.

409
00:29:42,011 --> 00:29:44,592
This? How is this little thing enough?

410
00:29:44,760 --> 00:29:45,913
This is all we have.

411
00:29:47,040 --> 00:29:48,192
What about that one over there?

412
00:29:48,880 --> 00:29:50,153
You can't eat that one.

413
00:29:52,239 --> 00:29:53,239
Just eat this one.

414
00:29:53,319 --> 00:29:54,319
All right.

415
00:30:00,880 --> 00:30:01,880
Quick.

416
00:30:02,199 --> 00:30:03,199
Quick.

417
00:30:15,040 --> 00:30:16,040
Yuan Bao,

418
00:30:16,199 --> 00:30:17,199
are you okay?

419
00:30:23,800 --> 00:30:24,873
Here, drink some water.

420
00:30:29,846 --> 00:30:30,524
Do you feel better?

421
00:30:38,439 --> 00:30:39,999
Mr. Chang Yue, now is the auspicious time.

422
00:30:40,079 --> 00:30:41,079
You can lift the veil.

423
00:30:57,040 --> 00:30:59,072
First lift for good fortune and blessings.

424
00:31:10,119 --> 00:31:11,832
Second lift for a loving life together.

425
00:31:19,119 --> 00:31:21,232
Third lift for an early child.

426
00:31:33,959 --> 00:31:36,033
Third lift for an early child.

427
00:31:42,319 --> 00:31:43,319
Mr. Chang Yue.

428
00:31:47,680 --> 00:31:48,680
Mr. Chang Yue?

429
00:31:49,400 --> 00:31:50,400
Mr. Chang Yue?

430
00:32:40,760 --> 00:32:43,673
Third lift for an early child.

431
00:32:51,160 --> 00:32:52,393
So you do blush.

432
00:32:53,959 --> 00:32:55,352
Who said I'm blushing?
