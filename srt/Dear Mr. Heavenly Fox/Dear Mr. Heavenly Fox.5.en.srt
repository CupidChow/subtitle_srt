1
00:01:48,872 --> 00:01:53,971
(Dear Mr. Heavenly Fox)

2
00:01:54,065 --> 00:01:57,282
(Episode 5)

3
00:02:02,225 --> 00:02:03,225
Sect Leader Qi.

4
00:02:03,306 --> 00:02:04,329
Farewell.

5
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:12,048
Qi, thank you for your hospitality these past few days.

6
00:02:12,160 --> 00:02:12,652
No problem.

7
00:02:12,898 --> 00:02:15,071
I plan to bring my disciples to Suiyue Mountain

8
00:02:15,240 --> 00:02:16,682
to monitor the situation there.

9
00:02:17,039 --> 00:02:19,722
I count on you to handle the situation there, Huo.

10
00:02:20,279 --> 00:02:20,923
Huo,

11
00:02:22,199 --> 00:02:23,848
my sect requires my attention

12
00:02:23,873 --> 00:02:24,910
so I won't be joining you.

13
00:02:25,527 --> 00:02:26,977
- Please forgive me.   - It's okay.

14
00:02:28,119 --> 00:02:29,335
Father. Mr. Qi.

15
00:02:29,753 --> 00:02:31,881
I want to say goodbye to Yuan Bao.

16
00:02:32,726 --> 00:02:33,175
Okay.

17
00:02:34,302 --> 00:02:34,848
Go ahead.

18
00:02:35,298 --> 00:02:36,510
But don't take too long.

19
00:02:36,619 --> 00:02:37,008
Okay.

20
00:02:38,960 --> 00:02:39,983
Qi.

21
00:02:40,479 --> 00:02:42,215
- Farewell.   - Farewell.

22
00:02:42,880 --> 00:02:43,903
Please.

23
00:02:59,281 --> 00:03:00,330
I'm so angry.

24
00:03:00,520 --> 00:03:01,729
He's clearly messing with me.

25
00:03:03,320 --> 00:03:05,042
I think you brought it on yourself.

26
00:03:08,119 --> 00:03:09,402
- I will...   - I...

27
00:03:09,919 --> 00:03:10,942
I...

28
00:03:11,682 --> 00:03:13,618
- Seriously.   - Huo.

29
00:03:13,919 --> 00:03:14,942
Shu Ya.

30
00:03:16,104 --> 00:03:17,703
I'm bored. I'll go do something fun.

31
00:03:17,839 --> 00:03:18,862
I...

32
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:21,242
Shu Ya.

33
00:03:22,033 --> 00:03:23,056
Yuan Bao.

34
00:03:24,926 --> 00:03:26,466
Shu Ya,

35
00:03:26,679 --> 00:03:29,042
don't tell me you're here to say goodbye.

36
00:03:29,224 --> 00:03:31,682
- Yes.   - You're leaving so soon?

37
00:03:33,839 --> 00:03:36,729
We hardly see each other.

38
00:03:37,004 --> 00:03:39,013
I haven't even had the chance to show you around.

39
00:03:39,290 --> 00:03:40,313
It's okay.

40
00:03:40,596 --> 00:03:42,006
When I visit next time,

41
00:03:42,119 --> 00:03:43,722
you have to show me Beixuan City.

42
00:03:44,479 --> 00:03:45,922
- It's a deal.   - It's a deal.

43
00:03:53,119 --> 00:03:54,322
Yuan Bao,

44
00:03:54,559 --> 00:03:57,082
do you have anything else you want to say to me?

45
00:03:59,039 --> 00:04:02,722
Yes. Be safe on your trip to Suiyue Mountain.

46
00:04:02,960 --> 00:04:03,983
I promise.

47
00:04:04,960 --> 00:04:05,983
Anything else?

48
00:04:06,199 --> 00:04:07,222
Anything else?

49
00:04:07,914 --> 00:04:09,882
Let me think.

50
00:04:12,800 --> 00:04:15,722
I hope your trip will be fruitful.

51
00:04:18,098 --> 00:04:19,322
Is that all?

52
00:04:19,449 --> 00:04:20,642
You want more?

53
00:04:20,833 --> 00:04:22,962
Then... then let me think again.

54
00:04:30,959 --> 00:04:31,982
Never mind.

55
00:04:50,877 --> 00:04:52,882
Yuan Bao, promise me

56
00:04:53,094 --> 00:04:55,322
you'll stay here and wait for me to come back.

57
00:05:10,473 --> 00:05:12,272
All right. It's getting late.

58
00:05:12,297 --> 00:05:12,956
I should go.

59
00:05:13,519 --> 00:05:14,542
While I'm gone,

60
00:05:14,697 --> 00:05:16,073
you must be careful.

61
00:05:16,480 --> 00:05:17,807
Don't get hurt again.

62
00:05:17,893 --> 00:05:19,274
Don't worry, Shu Ya.

63
00:05:19,354 --> 00:05:21,070
No one can bully me.

64
00:05:21,671 --> 00:05:23,002
Then I'm off.

65
00:05:23,138 --> 00:05:24,682
- See you.   - See you.

66
00:06:01,079 --> 00:06:03,903
If only I could leave this mountain.

67
00:06:04,136 --> 00:06:06,015
I'll definitely find out

68
00:06:06,119 --> 00:06:07,682
what this thing is.

69
00:06:08,079 --> 00:06:10,642
Why does my father treasure it so much?

70
00:06:18,519 --> 00:06:20,528
I can't wait for a year or two.

71
00:06:22,440 --> 00:06:25,288
I might as well use a more practical plan.

72
00:06:36,920 --> 00:06:38,960
Since they have already prepared this room,

73
00:06:39,048 --> 00:06:41,922
then tonight, I'll just have to squeeze in with you.

74
00:06:42,565 --> 00:06:45,022
- Why are you here?   - You're not going back.

75
00:06:45,160 --> 00:06:48,882
You want me to face Father's stern old face alone?

76
00:06:49,040 --> 00:06:50,482
I don't want to.

77
00:06:50,799 --> 00:06:53,288
I'd rather stay here in Beixuan City and go sightseeing with you.

78
00:06:53,440 --> 00:06:54,602
Stop horsing around.

79
00:06:54,920 --> 00:06:56,449
I have serious business to attend to.

80
00:06:56,545 --> 00:06:57,842
What serious business?

81
00:07:01,079 --> 00:07:02,562
You don't have to tell me.

82
00:07:02,799 --> 00:07:05,128
Father must have given you another secret mission, right?

83
00:07:07,119 --> 00:07:08,242
Speaking of which,

84
00:07:08,399 --> 00:07:09,680
how come Father let you stay here?

85
00:07:09,791 --> 00:07:14,520
I used my wit to sneak out.

86
00:07:15,119 --> 00:07:16,162
He has so many disciples.

87
00:07:16,320 --> 00:07:17,489
He doesn't have time for me.

88
00:07:52,842 --> 00:07:54,242
Let's start the lecture.

89
00:07:56,245 --> 00:07:57,882
Master.

90
00:08:02,239 --> 00:08:03,522
What's wrong?

91
00:08:04,168 --> 00:08:05,722
It's nothing.

92
00:08:06,519 --> 00:08:09,202
I just feel awful.

93
00:08:10,279 --> 00:08:11,402
Awful?

94
00:08:11,584 --> 00:08:12,922
Where are you hurt?

95
00:08:13,777 --> 00:08:16,865
Everywhere.

96
00:08:38,452 --> 00:08:39,475
You...

97
00:08:42,200 --> 00:08:43,025
What are you doing?

98
00:08:43,126 --> 00:08:44,798
Master, please save me.

99
00:08:45,920 --> 00:08:46,920
You...

100
00:08:46,945 --> 00:08:48,984
- Let go first.   - No, I won't let go.

101
00:08:49,159 --> 00:08:50,600
Master, if you don't save me,

102
00:08:50,625 --> 00:08:52,387
I'll die here.

103
00:08:52,719 --> 00:08:54,442
I'm here. You won't die.

104
00:08:54,467 --> 00:08:55,706
I will die.

105
00:08:55,907 --> 00:08:57,827
I'll die of boredom. I'll die of being cooped up.

106
00:08:57,978 --> 00:08:59,474
I might even be stabbed to death by an invader.

107
00:08:59,999 --> 00:09:01,022
Master,

108
00:09:01,173 --> 00:09:02,533
Father doesn't care about me.

109
00:09:02,660 --> 00:09:05,162
You don't care about me either?

110
00:09:05,289 --> 00:09:07,208
What a woeful life.

111
00:09:07,320 --> 00:09:10,722
Master, please help me.

112
00:09:18,239 --> 00:09:19,058
Keeping you in this place

113
00:09:19,683 --> 00:09:21,242
is not a long-term solution.

114
00:09:21,440 --> 00:09:23,322
Exactly. Feel bad for me.

115
00:09:23,520 --> 00:09:25,082
Father and Mother don't love me.

116
00:09:25,300 --> 00:09:27,607
Only Shu Ya took care of me since I was little.

117
00:09:28,226 --> 00:09:29,842
But now even he...

118
00:09:31,400 --> 00:09:32,922
Quit it.

119
00:09:33,399 --> 00:09:34,422
Master.

120
00:09:36,400 --> 00:09:37,145
Master.

121
00:09:44,736 --> 00:09:46,176
How has Yuan Bao been these past few days?

122
00:09:46,280 --> 00:09:49,248
After that day, Young Lady has become quiet.

123
00:09:51,559 --> 00:09:54,089
I'm afraid that she resents me

124
00:09:55,320 --> 00:09:57,009
more and more now.

125
00:09:58,564 --> 00:10:00,614
You just want to keep her safe.

126
00:10:01,760 --> 00:10:03,042
One day,

127
00:10:03,719 --> 00:10:05,289
Young Lady will understand.

128
00:10:07,479 --> 00:10:09,089
I'd rather she never

129
00:10:10,799 --> 00:10:12,329
finds out why in her lifetime.

130
00:10:16,723 --> 00:10:18,322
He pissed me off so much.

131
00:10:18,880 --> 00:10:20,202
He pissed me off so much.

132
00:10:20,408 --> 00:10:21,776
Since he doesn't want me to play nice,

133
00:10:21,960 --> 00:10:23,608
I'll play rough.

134
00:10:24,719 --> 00:10:25,742
Don't be rash.

135
00:10:25,880 --> 00:10:26,903
You can't defeat him anyway.

136
00:10:27,039 --> 00:10:28,289
Who said I was going to fight him?

137
00:10:28,559 --> 00:10:29,582
Did you forget?

138
00:10:31,599 --> 00:10:32,649
I have this.

139
00:10:34,100 --> 00:10:35,515
- Obedience Talisman?   - That's right.

140
00:10:36,239 --> 00:10:38,769
I'll stick this on him,

141
00:10:39,025 --> 00:10:41,242
and he'll have to take me down the mountain.

142
00:10:41,386 --> 00:10:43,120
But there's only one Obedience Talisman.

143
00:10:43,201 --> 00:10:44,442
And it's for Uncle Qi.

144
00:10:44,559 --> 00:10:46,048
Wouldn't it be a waste to use it on him?

145
00:10:46,280 --> 00:10:48,048
Well, I have to find an opportunity first.

146
00:10:48,200 --> 00:10:50,449
I'm locked up in this godforsaken place all day.

147
00:10:50,700 --> 00:10:52,263
And Father doesn't come here often.

148
00:10:52,674 --> 00:10:54,690
So he has to be the target.

149
00:10:55,257 --> 00:10:56,602
I guess so.

150
00:10:58,443 --> 00:10:59,762
Chang Yue is here.

151
00:11:03,472 --> 00:11:04,363
Master.

152
00:11:06,159 --> 00:11:07,959
- Let's begin the lecture.   - Okay.

153
00:11:17,738 --> 00:11:19,497
- Did it work?   - Of course, it did.

154
00:11:19,631 --> 00:11:21,591
It's our precious talisman. It will work.

155
00:11:21,672 --> 00:11:22,695
Test it.

156
00:11:24,962 --> 00:11:25,985
Chang Yue.

157
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:29,023
Yes?

158
00:11:29,641 --> 00:11:31,242
Take two steps to the left.

159
00:11:37,359 --> 00:11:38,722
Now take two steps to the right.

160
00:11:42,499 --> 00:11:43,802
Hooray!

161
00:11:44,104 --> 00:11:45,402
It works.

162
00:11:48,280 --> 00:11:51,289
He usually looks so scary.

163
00:11:51,465 --> 00:11:52,634
But like this,

164
00:11:52,726 --> 00:11:54,682
he's much more pleasing to the eye.

165
00:11:57,719 --> 00:11:58,719
Let's not waste any time.

166
00:11:58,799 --> 00:12:00,776
- Let's use him to leave the mountain.   - Right.

167
00:12:01,644 --> 00:12:03,527
Do you have any money on you?

168
00:12:05,760 --> 00:12:07,442
Uncle Qi confiscated all my money

169
00:12:07,605 --> 00:12:09,460
to make sure you can't leave.

170
00:12:09,561 --> 00:12:10,561
I don't have any.

171
00:12:10,680 --> 00:12:12,362
You're useless.

172
00:12:12,919 --> 00:12:14,078
If we don't have money,

173
00:12:14,159 --> 00:12:15,642
how can we leave this place?

174
00:12:16,159 --> 00:12:17,182
Let me think.

175
00:12:25,197 --> 00:12:27,842
(Chang Yue's calligraphy should be worth a lot of money.)

176
00:12:28,280 --> 00:12:29,522
I have an idea.

177
00:12:30,320 --> 00:12:32,642
Chang Yue Calligraphy Auction.

178
00:12:33,614 --> 00:12:35,202
Line up.

179
00:12:36,697 --> 00:12:38,042
Next.

180
00:12:39,719 --> 00:12:41,682
- Make a line.   - Come.

181
00:12:41,890 --> 00:12:43,362
- Next.   - Hurry.

182
00:12:43,721 --> 00:12:45,737
Be patient. There's enough for everyone.

183
00:12:45,880 --> 00:12:47,122
Okay.

184
00:12:53,416 --> 00:12:55,122
- Here.   - I want one too.

185
00:12:55,856 --> 00:12:58,122
We don't have to worry about money anymore.

186
00:12:58,679 --> 00:13:01,688
Chang Yue's calligraphy is indeed worth a lot.

187
00:13:34,105 --> 00:13:35,682
Chang Yue, come here.

188
00:13:42,059 --> 00:13:43,482
Come on, hurry.

189
00:13:45,400 --> 00:13:46,602
Chang Yue.

190
00:13:46,921 --> 00:13:49,322
Do you see those people? Freeze them all.

191
00:13:51,299 --> 00:13:52,762
Freeze.

192
00:13:58,080 --> 00:13:59,103
Not bad.

193
00:13:59,384 --> 00:14:00,602
Good job, Chang Yue.

194
00:14:00,760 --> 00:14:01,588
Good job.

195
00:14:09,632 --> 00:14:11,018
Why are they moving again?

196
00:14:12,141 --> 00:14:13,926
Did the spell fail?

197
00:14:15,297 --> 00:14:16,033
Freeze them again.

198
00:14:18,953 --> 00:14:19,688
Freeze.

199
00:14:26,039 --> 00:14:27,602
Why are they moving again?

200
00:14:28,679 --> 00:14:30,282
Again. Freeze.

201
00:14:31,359 --> 00:14:32,095
Freeze.

202
00:14:36,960 --> 00:14:38,802
- Freeze.   - Freeze.

203
00:14:40,344 --> 00:14:42,482
- Freeze.   - Freeze.

204
00:14:42,705 --> 00:14:44,842
- Freeze.   - Freeze.

205
00:14:44,962 --> 00:14:47,082
- Freeze.   - Freeze.

206
00:14:47,163 --> 00:14:48,762
- Freeze.   - Freeze.

207
00:14:50,996 --> 00:14:54,045
Yuan Bao should have left the mountain by now.

208
00:15:00,673 --> 00:15:01,962
And now,

209
00:15:02,159 --> 00:15:04,368
I'm all alone. That's boring.

210
00:15:11,395 --> 00:15:13,602
- Freeze.   - Freeze.

211
00:15:13,856 --> 00:15:15,216
- Freeze.   - Freeze.

212
00:15:15,320 --> 00:15:16,609
Freeze.

213
00:15:18,363 --> 00:15:20,802
Is it even working?

214
00:15:26,459 --> 00:15:29,082
I'm sleepy. Carry me to bed.

215
00:15:51,362 --> 00:15:53,642
Don't leave. Stay right here.

216
00:17:35,457 --> 00:17:36,842
What did you do?

217
00:17:37,139 --> 00:17:39,882
I didn't do anything to you.

218
00:17:40,439 --> 00:17:41,462
I put a talisman on you.

219
00:17:41,598 --> 00:17:44,042
But you couldn't even use the stasis spell.

220
00:17:51,792 --> 00:17:55,162
I just made you write a few words.

221
00:17:57,793 --> 00:17:58,802
That's all?

222
00:18:00,400 --> 00:18:01,389
Perhaps...

223
00:18:03,134 --> 00:18:06,147
Perhaps some people

224
00:18:06,319 --> 00:18:07,231
touched you.

225
00:18:07,473 --> 00:18:08,795
You...

226
00:18:12,050 --> 00:18:13,005
Chang Yue, don't go!

227
00:18:16,123 --> 00:18:17,146
You...

228
00:18:17,679 --> 00:18:18,882
Can you take me away?

229
00:18:19,016 --> 00:18:21,562
I can give you all the silver taels I earned.

230
00:18:31,016 --> 00:18:32,802
Do you really want to leave that badly?

231
00:18:35,565 --> 00:18:36,588
If one day,

232
00:18:36,669 --> 00:18:38,388
her heart skips a beat when she sees you,

233
00:18:38,537 --> 00:18:39,960
she can't help but get close to you,

234
00:18:40,109 --> 00:18:41,917
touch you, and kiss you,

235
00:18:42,048 --> 00:18:44,322
or when she sees you as the only one,

236
00:18:44,560 --> 00:18:47,082
that's when you know she has truly fallen in love with you.

237
00:18:48,911 --> 00:18:50,522
I can take you away.

238
00:18:52,040 --> 00:18:53,040
For real?

239
00:18:53,205 --> 00:18:54,374
But on one condition.

240
00:18:54,968 --> 00:18:56,585
Tell me.

241
00:18:56,720 --> 00:18:58,136
I can give you anything you want.

242
00:18:59,613 --> 00:19:00,636
Kiss me.

243
00:19:04,429 --> 00:19:05,452
You...

244
00:19:05,864 --> 00:19:07,322
What did you say?

245
00:19:08,348 --> 00:19:09,562
Is it difficult?

246
00:19:11,828 --> 00:19:13,042
It's...

247
00:19:13,223 --> 00:19:14,922
It's not that difficult.

248
00:19:15,129 --> 00:19:16,152
It's...

249
00:19:18,155 --> 00:19:20,162
It's very difficult.

250
00:19:24,988 --> 00:19:27,362
Then forget it. I don't like to force people.

251
00:20:16,748 --> 00:20:18,162
I...

252
00:20:18,425 --> 00:20:20,522
I...

253
00:20:22,748 --> 00:20:23,748
I did it.

254
00:20:23,913 --> 00:20:26,722
Can I leave this place now?

255
00:20:53,028 --> 00:20:54,322
Young Lady Qi.

256
00:20:55,228 --> 00:20:56,802
Long time no see.

257
00:20:57,147 --> 00:20:58,841
Bring your friends in to play a few rounds.

258
00:20:58,955 --> 00:21:00,422
No. We have other plans today.

259
00:21:00,509 --> 00:21:02,464
- I'll take a rain check.   - I'll be waiting for you.

260
00:21:02,602 --> 00:21:04,175
- Sure.   - Okay.

261
00:21:18,268 --> 00:21:18,925
Master.

262
00:21:19,930 --> 00:21:20,906
Were you looking for me?

263
00:21:26,030 --> 00:21:27,322
This is for you.

264
00:21:27,469 --> 00:21:30,318
Consider it a gift for taking me down the mountain.

265
00:21:39,538 --> 00:21:40,882
You seem to like foxes a lot.

266
00:21:41,139 --> 00:21:42,442
I do.

267
00:21:42,641 --> 00:21:45,051
But Father hates them.

268
00:21:46,747 --> 00:21:47,770
Why so?

269
00:21:48,789 --> 00:21:50,562
Father can be quite odd.

270
00:21:50,643 --> 00:21:51,933
I don't know why either.

271
00:21:53,787 --> 00:21:55,195
Then why do you like foxes?

272
00:21:56,748 --> 00:21:58,282
If liking something needs a reason,

273
00:21:58,430 --> 00:22:00,522
then hating something needs a reason too.

274
00:22:00,789 --> 00:22:03,829
If I can't give a reason why I hate foxes,

275
00:22:03,948 --> 00:22:06,170
why should I join others and hate foxes too?

276
00:22:06,643 --> 00:22:08,002
Besides,

277
00:22:08,514 --> 00:22:10,762
the little fox I met is super cute.

278
00:22:13,674 --> 00:22:14,697
Cute?

279
00:22:16,228 --> 00:22:18,002
Anyway, we're out of Qishan Sect now.

280
00:22:18,418 --> 00:22:19,547
I'll let you in on a secret.

281
00:22:19,747 --> 00:22:22,356
I raised a super cute fox.

282
00:22:24,829 --> 00:22:26,562
(Since when did I become your pet?)

283
00:22:26,868 --> 00:22:29,562
But I left in such a hurry this time

284
00:22:29,709 --> 00:22:31,242
that I didn't even say goodbye.

285
00:22:31,388 --> 00:22:33,798
I wonder if I'll see it again when I go back.

286
00:22:36,189 --> 00:22:37,877
If it's meant to be, you'll meet it again.

287
00:22:40,316 --> 00:22:41,339
That's true.

288
00:22:41,508 --> 00:22:43,509
I believe that cute little guy

289
00:22:43,589 --> 00:22:45,042
is waiting for me at home.

290
00:22:46,709 --> 00:22:48,162
Master. Come quickly!

291
00:23:05,919 --> 00:23:07,100
Running away?

292
00:23:11,906 --> 00:23:13,474
Tian, you're so strong.

293
00:23:13,581 --> 00:23:14,402
Xue Han Yu.

294
00:23:14,770 --> 00:23:15,899
Tell me the truth.

295
00:23:17,069 --> 00:23:19,762
Yuan Bao begged her tutor

296
00:23:20,363 --> 00:23:22,051
to take her away.

297
00:23:22,301 --> 00:23:23,246
Chang Yue?

298
00:23:26,306 --> 00:23:27,952
Who would have thought that this tutor

299
00:23:28,579 --> 00:23:30,468
would betray me?

300
00:23:30,650 --> 00:23:31,493
He

301
00:23:32,058 --> 00:23:34,427
is doing it for Yuan Bao as well.

302
00:23:36,225 --> 00:23:38,305
Uncle Qi, Yuan Bao is bored.

303
00:23:38,435 --> 00:23:40,480
Let her have fun. She'll come back when she's had enough.

304
00:23:40,561 --> 00:23:42,960
What do you know? Do you know how dangerous it is outside?

305
00:23:43,041 --> 00:23:44,282
It's not dangerous.

306
00:23:44,497 --> 00:23:45,787
The tutor is very powerful.

307
00:23:45,930 --> 00:23:47,522
He will keep Yuan Bao safe.

308
00:23:48,987 --> 00:23:50,962
Are you sure that the tutor won't hurt her?

309
00:23:52,570 --> 00:23:54,978
She's surrounded by enemies.

310
00:23:55,729 --> 00:23:57,202
You're not helping her.

311
00:23:57,530 --> 00:23:58,802
You're putting her in danger.

312
00:24:01,085 --> 00:24:02,845
- Master.   - Uncle Qi.

313
00:24:03,066 --> 00:24:05,282
Uncle Qi, I'll help find Yuan Bao too.

314
00:24:08,268 --> 00:24:09,469
Bravo!

315
00:24:09,588 --> 00:24:10,611
Look.

316
00:24:13,549 --> 00:24:14,908
- Bravo!   - Wonderful.

317
00:24:14,988 --> 00:24:16,362
- Bravo!   - Bravo!

318
00:24:17,849 --> 00:24:19,122
Master, look.

319
00:24:39,628 --> 00:24:42,322
Master, stay close to me later.

320
00:24:44,988 --> 00:24:46,011
Quick.

321
00:24:47,624 --> 00:24:48,834
Come.

322
00:24:48,969 --> 00:24:51,202
- Come and play.   - Young Lady Qi.

323
00:24:51,389 --> 00:24:52,773
I'm with a friend.

324
00:24:52,854 --> 00:24:54,642
Don't be so eager. Master, let's go.

325
00:24:57,432 --> 00:25:00,256
Master, in a place like this, this kind of thing is useless.

326
00:25:00,394 --> 00:25:01,682
Throw them away.

327
00:25:02,256 --> 00:25:04,469
Ladies, you have a customer.

328
00:25:04,595 --> 00:25:05,962
Young Lady Qi.

329
00:25:07,309 --> 00:25:09,264
You're finally here. We've missed you so much.

330
00:25:09,377 --> 00:25:10,667
- We miss you.   - Is that so?

331
00:25:10,842 --> 00:25:12,056
Come. Let's hang out inside.

332
00:25:12,137 --> 00:25:13,160
Let's go.

333
00:25:14,330 --> 00:25:16,322
You're all so beautiful.

334
00:25:16,631 --> 00:25:17,831
Master, I'm too busy for you.

335
00:25:17,912 --> 00:25:19,122
You take care of yourself.

336
00:25:19,201 --> 00:25:20,802
- Okay.   - Have a seat, Young Lady Qi.

337
00:25:24,189 --> 00:25:25,189
Young Lady Qi.

338
00:25:25,269 --> 00:25:27,109
- Young Lady Qi, it's been a while.   - I know.

339
00:25:27,236 --> 00:25:28,259
(We kissed.)

340
00:25:28,366 --> 00:25:29,508
(Yet it isn't successful.)

341
00:25:29,589 --> 00:25:30,746
(If one day,)

342
00:25:30,827 --> 00:25:32,307
(her heart skips a beat when she sees you,)

343
00:25:32,420 --> 00:25:33,989
(she can't help but get close to you,)

344
00:25:34,140 --> 00:25:36,798
I miss you all so much, so I came to see you.

345
00:25:37,022 --> 00:25:38,045
(touch you)

346
00:25:38,126 --> 00:25:40,242
You're still so beautiful.

347
00:25:40,563 --> 00:25:41,842
(and kiss you,)

348
00:25:42,549 --> 00:25:44,922
(or when she sees you as the only one,)

349
00:25:45,274 --> 00:25:47,726
(that's when you know she has truly fallen in love with you.)

350
00:25:47,807 --> 00:25:50,402
(When that happens, the in-tandem cultivation is successful!)

351
00:25:54,217 --> 00:25:54,812
Sir.

352
00:25:55,456 --> 00:25:57,457
Sir, we've already searched this area,

353
00:25:57,538 --> 00:25:58,572
but we didn't see Young Lady.

354
00:26:00,019 --> 00:26:01,522
- Split up and search.   - Okay.

355
00:26:02,189 --> 00:26:02,704
Come.

356
00:26:07,949 --> 00:26:08,972
Shen Shen,

357
00:26:09,465 --> 00:26:11,065
aren't we here for sightseeing?

358
00:26:11,183 --> 00:26:12,873
We've been staying here for a few days.

359
00:26:14,028 --> 00:26:15,051
Mr. Xue.

360
00:26:16,531 --> 00:26:19,602
- Welcome.   - Sir, have you seen Yuan Bao?

361
00:26:21,268 --> 00:26:23,438
I haven't seen her in a while either.

362
00:26:26,469 --> 00:26:28,002
Where did Yuan Bao go this time?

363
00:26:28,371 --> 00:26:30,067
Mr. Xue, please have a seat.

364
00:26:30,257 --> 00:26:31,280
It's okay.

365
00:26:32,186 --> 00:26:33,987
You know what? You search there. I'll search there.

366
00:26:34,099 --> 00:26:35,227
Xue Han Yu?

367
00:26:40,710 --> 00:26:42,082
It's you two.

368
00:26:42,328 --> 00:26:44,368
Aren't you going to Suiyue Mountain? Why are you here?

369
00:26:44,464 --> 00:26:45,487
Don't be nosy.

370
00:26:46,207 --> 00:26:48,442
We'll go wherever we want. It's none of your business.

371
00:26:49,000 --> 00:26:51,362
I'll let you go this time since Shen Shen is here.

372
00:26:52,792 --> 00:26:54,778
Young Lady Su, have you seen Yuan Bao?

373
00:26:55,476 --> 00:26:56,225
Not at all.

374
00:26:56,754 --> 00:26:59,113
Wasn't she grounded on the mountain?

375
00:26:59,549 --> 00:27:02,148
What a headache. Yuan Bao has the ability to go anywhere.

376
00:27:02,271 --> 00:27:02,944
She ran away again.

377
00:27:04,028 --> 00:27:06,082
It's not that hard to find her.

378
00:27:06,556 --> 00:27:08,355
It's either House of Belle or Changle Gambling Den.

379
00:27:08,436 --> 00:27:10,384
You won't find her here. Don't you know her well enough?

380
00:27:10,465 --> 00:27:13,082
- Right.   - As her loyal sidekick...
