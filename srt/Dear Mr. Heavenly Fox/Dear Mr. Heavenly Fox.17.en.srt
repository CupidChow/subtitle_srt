00:01:48,792 --> 00:01:54,011
(Dear Mr. Heavenly Fox)

2
00:01:54,072 --> 00:01:56,979
(Episode 17)

3
00:01:57,440 --> 00:01:59,321
Hand over the woman colluding with the fox demon!

4
00:01:59,424 --> 00:02:01,502
Hand over the woman colluding with the fox demon!

5
00:02:01,614 --> 00:02:02,719
Enough of your accusations.

6
00:02:02,800 --> 00:02:04,276
When did Yuan Bao collude with a fox demon?

7
00:02:04,411 --> 00:02:07,903
How dare you? If she hadn't let the fox demon go,

8
00:02:08,080 --> 00:02:09,479
would so many people have died?

9
00:02:09,552 --> 00:02:10,552
That's right.

10
00:02:10,639 --> 00:02:11,842
Hand her over!

11
00:02:11,976 --> 00:02:14,602
If you don't bring her to us today,

12
00:02:14,720 --> 00:02:16,593
we'll flatten the Qishan Sect!

13
00:02:16,759 --> 00:02:18,353
- Charge!   - That's right.

14
00:02:19,639 --> 00:02:21,322
- Hand her over!   - What are you doing?

15
00:02:21,944 --> 00:02:22,944
- Calm down.   - Stop!

16
00:02:23,040 --> 00:02:24,479
- Calm down.   - Stop!

17
00:02:24,559 --> 00:02:25,559
Hand her over!

18
00:02:25,639 --> 00:02:26,639
Back off.

19
00:02:29,639 --> 00:02:30,901
What do you want?

20
00:02:31,119 --> 00:02:34,135
Can't you tell we're here to seek justice for our dead

21
00:02:34,307 --> 00:02:36,199
- relatives and friends?   - That's right!

22
00:02:36,991 --> 00:02:38,362
Sect Leader Qi,

23
00:02:38,559 --> 00:02:40,233
you are the head of the largest cultivation family

24
00:02:40,440 --> 00:02:42,433
and should be responsible for eliminating demons.

25
00:02:42,600 --> 00:02:46,095
Who knew you'd raise a traitor like Qi Yuan Bao

26
00:02:46,508 --> 00:02:49,101
who released a fox demon to wreak havoc on the world?

27
00:02:49,266 --> 00:02:52,081
Shouldn't you be held accountable?

28
00:02:52,279 --> 00:02:54,313
That's right. He should.

29
00:02:54,600 --> 00:02:55,600
You should.

30
00:02:55,680 --> 00:02:56,920
Right, hand her over!

31
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:58,562
Hand her over!

32
00:02:58,686 --> 00:03:00,002
Ladies and gentlemen,

33
00:03:00,399 --> 00:03:02,208
I have failed to discipline my daughter.

34
00:03:02,440 --> 00:03:04,593
I apologize to all of you.

35
00:03:05,320 --> 00:03:06,713
But please believe me

36
00:03:06,838 --> 00:03:08,678
that Yuan Bao would never collude with a fox demon.

37
00:03:08,759 --> 00:03:10,039
How are we supposed to believe you?

38
00:03:10,119 --> 00:03:11,599
Right, how can we believe you?

39
00:03:11,679 --> 00:03:12,912
My wife and child

40
00:03:13,160 --> 00:03:14,520
both died at the hands of the fox demon.

41
00:03:14,701 --> 00:03:17,300
And my mother also died tragically.

42
00:03:17,395 --> 00:03:20,962
If Qi Yuan Bao gives the soul back to the fox demon,

43
00:03:21,249 --> 00:03:22,802
the fox demon will be stronger

44
00:03:22,919 --> 00:03:24,880
and come back to attack us in the future.

45
00:03:24,960 --> 00:03:27,759
Wouldn't all of us die at the hands of that fox demon?

46
00:03:27,854 --> 00:03:29,247
Yes, that's right.

47
00:03:29,622 --> 00:03:33,720
In that case, shouldn't we kill Qi Yuan Bao first to save ourselves?

48
00:03:33,801 --> 00:03:37,513
- That's right.   - Kill her for our future!

49
00:03:37,639 --> 00:03:38,639
Ladies and gentlemen.

50
00:03:39,440 --> 00:03:40,440
Rest assured.

51
00:03:40,720 --> 00:03:42,472
The fox demon will not be able to retrieve the soul.

52
00:03:42,600 --> 00:03:43,713
How can you be so sure?

53
00:03:43,919 --> 00:03:45,032
Yes, how can you be so sure?

54
00:03:45,160 --> 00:03:46,160
Tell us.

55
00:03:49,839 --> 00:03:50,839
Soon,

56
00:03:50,919 --> 00:03:52,233
I will marry Yuan Bao.

57
00:03:52,440 --> 00:03:53,602
After the marriage,

58
00:03:53,759 --> 00:03:56,600
the fox demon will never be able to retrieve the soul.

59
00:03:56,681 --> 00:03:58,755
- Should we believe him?   - Why should we believe him?

60
00:04:00,399 --> 00:04:01,842
Is it true or false?

61
00:04:01,960 --> 00:04:03,522
What if he's lying to us?

62
00:04:04,800 --> 00:04:05,897
The traitor is here.

63
00:04:07,080 --> 00:04:07,803
Father.

64
00:04:08,219 --> 00:04:09,760
- Yuan Bao.   - Hand her over!

65
00:04:09,840 --> 00:04:11,112
It's her.

66
00:04:11,479 --> 00:04:13,000
- Don't spare her.   - Hand her over.

67
00:04:13,346 --> 00:04:14,313
- Don't let her escape.   - Exactly.

68
00:04:16,559 --> 00:04:17,152
Father.

69
00:04:19,079 --> 00:04:20,193
As long as I get married,

70
00:04:21,119 --> 00:04:23,097
he will never be able to take the soul?

71
00:04:28,720 --> 00:04:29,993
That's what the legend says.

72
00:04:30,359 --> 00:04:31,713
If you marry Shu Ya,

73
00:04:31,920 --> 00:04:32,920
then Chang Yue

74
00:04:32,921 --> 00:04:34,753
will never be able to complete in tandem cultivation,

75
00:04:35,359 --> 00:04:36,713
to retrieve the soul.

76
00:04:40,920 --> 00:04:41,618
Yuan Bao,

77
00:04:41,993 --> 00:04:42,993
don't force yourself.

78
00:04:43,279 --> 00:04:46,682
I said that in the heat of the moment.

79
00:04:46,985 --> 00:04:48,308
Don't take it to heart.

80
00:04:50,643 --> 00:04:51,883
So he was lying to us!

81
00:04:51,964 --> 00:04:53,045
We can't believe him!

82
00:04:53,143 --> 00:04:54,695
Since you refuse to kill the traitor,

83
00:04:54,839 --> 00:04:56,272
let's raid the Qishan Sect.

84
00:04:56,399 --> 00:04:57,522
Charge!

85
00:04:57,645 --> 00:04:58,882
Kill her!

86
00:05:01,079 --> 00:05:02,593
Calm down.

87
00:05:02,920 --> 00:05:04,279
- Kill her!   - Sect Leader Qi,

88
00:05:04,359 --> 00:05:05,359
what should we do?

89
00:05:05,439 --> 00:05:06,599
They are all innocent people.

90
00:05:06,679 --> 00:05:08,633
Besides, we can't use violence against them.

91
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:10,839
Or they'll say we're bullying the weak.

92
00:05:11,607 --> 00:05:13,074
But we can't hand Yuan Bao over either.

93
00:05:13,799 --> 00:05:15,640
Mr. Qi, let's fight them.

94
00:05:15,880 --> 00:05:17,401
If we act rashly, our reputation

95
00:05:17,481 --> 00:05:18,920
and legacy of so many years

96
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:20,512
will be ruined.

97
00:05:21,119 --> 00:05:22,119
Stop it!

98
00:05:37,480 --> 00:05:39,272
I promise everyone

99
00:05:40,079 --> 00:05:41,593
that I will marry Huo Shu Ya.

100
00:05:43,279 --> 00:05:44,392
I will not let the fox demon

101
00:05:45,006 --> 00:05:46,559
retrieve the soul from me.

102
00:05:47,359 --> 00:05:48,633
Nor will I give the fox demon

103
00:05:48,839 --> 00:05:50,593
any more opportunities to slaughter our people.

104
00:05:51,399 --> 00:05:54,033
If he commits another crime in the future,

105
00:05:55,219 --> 00:05:56,932
I will definitely not let him off easily.

106
00:05:58,799 --> 00:05:59,993
Is this good enough for you?

107
00:06:01,119 --> 00:06:02,119
Right.

108
00:06:02,359 --> 00:06:03,960
How can we believe her? You two are in cahoots!

109
00:06:04,040 --> 00:06:05,040
Right.

110
00:06:05,239 --> 00:06:06,792
How can we believe this traitor?

111
00:06:10,720 --> 00:06:11,720
So?

112
00:06:11,800 --> 00:06:13,159
Is Young Master Huo

113
00:06:13,720 --> 00:06:15,039
satisfied with our service?

114
00:06:15,119 --> 00:06:16,482
Take this and share it.

115
00:06:19,559 --> 00:06:21,039
If you need my service again,

116
00:06:21,119 --> 00:06:22,642
come to me.

117
00:06:38,519 --> 00:06:39,961
Your Highness, you're injured.

118
00:06:40,041 --> 00:06:41,153
Why aren't you resting properly?

119
00:06:41,839 --> 00:06:42,952
You are to follow Aunt Meng Shu.

120
00:06:43,760 --> 00:06:47,799
Has she done anything in Beixuan City recently?

121
00:06:48,037 --> 00:06:50,033
She has stopped leaving Beiming.

122
00:06:50,480 --> 00:06:51,832
But strangely,

123
00:06:51,989 --> 00:06:53,901
Beixuan City still has many dead cultivators.

124
00:06:54,480 --> 00:06:55,879
And those stupid humans

125
00:06:56,029 --> 00:06:58,142
keep saying it's our fox clan's doing.

126
00:06:58,566 --> 00:07:00,918
Someone is trying to frame us again.

127
00:07:02,908 --> 00:07:05,421
Honestly, you shouldn't have saved them back then.

128
00:07:05,679 --> 00:07:06,913
You saved them,

129
00:07:07,119 --> 00:07:09,522
but now they keep framing the fox clan.

130
00:07:09,853 --> 00:07:11,273
What a bunch of ungrateful wretches!

131
00:07:11,354 --> 00:07:13,392
And that Qi Yuan Bao is even more heartless.

132
00:07:13,600 --> 00:07:15,859
You've done so much for her, but she wants to kill you.

133
00:07:15,940 --> 00:07:16,885
Huo Shu Ya and she even...

134
00:07:19,920 --> 00:07:21,193
What about her and Huo Shu Ya?

135
00:07:24,959 --> 00:07:26,499
Must I use the Spill-the-Beans Spell?

136
00:07:26,799 --> 00:07:27,456
Fine.

137
00:07:28,136 --> 00:07:31,239
People in Beixuan City are all talking about

138
00:07:31,721 --> 00:07:33,481
how Qi Yuan Bao publicly promised

139
00:07:33,562 --> 00:07:35,039
to marry the heir of the Huo family,

140
00:07:35,152 --> 00:07:36,152
Huo Shu Ya.

141
00:07:36,233 --> 00:07:37,842
And the wedding is tomorrow.

142
00:07:38,527 --> 00:07:39,527
Seriously,

143
00:07:39,720 --> 00:07:42,553
Qi Yuan Bao is the most ungrateful wretch of them all.

144
00:07:42,679 --> 00:07:44,122
She's not worth your...

145
00:07:56,760 --> 00:07:57,760
Yuan Bao.

146
00:07:58,720 --> 00:07:59,720
This way.

147
00:08:00,200 --> 00:08:01,200
Yuan Bao.

148
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:04,882
Miss, this is the wedding robe you'll wear tomorrow.

149
00:08:05,142 --> 00:08:06,282
Try it on first.

150
00:08:06,381 --> 00:08:08,855
If anything doesn't fit, there's still time to alter it.

151
00:08:21,440 --> 00:08:23,313
You look so beautiful in this.

152
00:08:23,559 --> 00:08:25,193
She is naturally pretty,

153
00:08:25,440 --> 00:08:26,713
and after putting this on,

154
00:08:26,959 --> 00:08:28,640
she looks like goddess incarnate.

155
00:08:28,720 --> 00:08:30,480
I think the size is fine.

156
00:08:30,560 --> 00:08:31,633
So no need to alter it.

157
00:08:32,239 --> 00:08:33,433
All right.

158
00:08:33,760 --> 00:08:35,760
Yuan Bao, why don't you get some rest?

159
00:08:35,840 --> 00:08:37,032
Tomorrow will be tiring for you.

160
00:08:37,280 --> 00:08:38,280
Give it to me.

161
00:08:51,833 --> 00:08:52,833
Chang Yue.

162
00:09:22,039 --> 00:09:24,193
I'm still worried about Yuan Bao getting married this soon.

163
00:09:24,719 --> 00:09:25,953
I'm going to talk to Huo.

164
00:09:29,520 --> 00:09:30,520
Who is it?

165
00:09:44,799 --> 00:09:45,799
Why are you here?

166
00:09:47,280 --> 00:09:48,472
Qi Yuan Bao is getting married.

167
00:09:49,320 --> 00:09:50,962
Someone's crying their eyes out.

168
00:09:51,280 --> 00:09:53,962
So I came to enjoy the view.

169
00:09:57,239 --> 00:09:58,239
Fine.

170
00:09:58,719 --> 00:10:01,922
I was afraid you couldn't sleep, so I came to chat with you.

171
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:05,633
Thanks.

172
00:10:05,760 --> 00:10:07,680
But I have to talk to Huo first.

173
00:10:07,760 --> 00:10:08,993
Wait here.

174
00:10:09,599 --> 00:10:10,599
Stop.

175
00:10:10,679 --> 00:10:11,679
Wait.

176
00:10:11,759 --> 00:10:13,400
It's so late. Why are you talking to him now?

177
00:10:14,200 --> 00:10:16,232
I'm still a little worried about Yuan Bao

178
00:10:16,479 --> 00:10:18,520
so I'm going to ask Huo about their plan after the wedding.

179
00:10:19,366 --> 00:10:20,078
What?

180
00:10:20,799 --> 00:10:22,313
Why are you so nosy?

181
00:10:22,474 --> 00:10:23,985
Are you going to help them

182
00:10:24,070 --> 00:10:25,032
raise their kids too?

183
00:10:25,919 --> 00:10:26,993
I will. Do you have a problem?

184
00:10:45,679 --> 00:10:46,679
Shu Ya.

185
00:10:47,320 --> 00:10:48,320
Shu Ya.

186
00:10:49,960 --> 00:10:50,960
Father.

187
00:10:51,039 --> 00:10:52,552
Have you really thought this through?

188
00:10:52,919 --> 00:10:53,919
Father.

189
00:10:54,119 --> 00:10:55,313
What do you mean by that?

190
00:10:55,679 --> 00:10:57,672
You know Yuan Bao doesn't like you.

191
00:10:57,880 --> 00:10:59,232
Why force her?

192
00:10:59,799 --> 00:11:01,912
You have to know that love can't be forced.

193
00:11:04,320 --> 00:11:05,320
Father,

194
00:11:05,559 --> 00:11:06,719
I don't care

195
00:11:06,799 --> 00:11:08,393
whether Yuan Bao loves me or not.

196
00:11:10,457 --> 00:11:11,737
She betrayed me first.

197
00:11:11,871 --> 00:11:13,390
Huo is going to marry Yuan Bao,

198
00:11:13,479 --> 00:11:15,073
but she is my only cousin.

199
00:11:15,359 --> 00:11:16,472
I'll miss her a lot.

200
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:21,193
I won't hold any grudges.

201
00:11:28,880 --> 00:11:30,753
I know the resentment in you.

202
00:11:32,080 --> 00:11:33,082
I only hope

203
00:11:33,626 --> 00:11:35,346
that after you marry Yuan Bao,

204
00:11:35,479 --> 00:11:36,959
you will let Chang Yue go.

205
00:11:37,124 --> 00:11:39,478
After all, on Suiyue Mountain, he saved my life.

206
00:11:39,660 --> 00:11:41,013
Framing Chang Yue

207
00:11:41,559 --> 00:11:43,282
and joining you to hunt him down

208
00:11:43,640 --> 00:11:45,672
have made me uneasy.

209
00:11:55,760 --> 00:11:56,760
Let's go.

210
00:11:58,520 --> 00:11:59,520
Let's go.

211
00:12:08,559 --> 00:12:09,559
Who's there?

212
00:12:22,479 --> 00:12:23,479
What are you doing?

213
00:12:24,640 --> 00:12:25,640
What do you want?

214
00:12:26,320 --> 00:12:27,320
Listen.

215
00:12:27,613 --> 00:12:30,442
I will never let Yuan Bao marry an evil man like you.

216
00:12:42,520 --> 00:12:43,520
Behave now.

217
00:12:44,559 --> 00:12:45,252
Don't worry.

218
00:12:45,858 --> 00:12:46,858
You are Yuan Bao's cousin.

219
00:12:47,239 --> 00:12:48,239
I won't hurt you.

220
00:12:48,440 --> 00:12:49,217
What about me?

221
00:12:49,520 --> 00:12:50,953
After I marry Yuan Bao tomorrow,

222
00:12:51,479 --> 00:12:52,873
I will release you.

223
00:12:57,520 --> 00:12:58,520
Keep an eye on them.

224
00:12:58,719 --> 00:12:59,464
Noted.

225
00:13:09,685 --> 00:13:11,961
(Lingxiao Hall)

226
00:13:12,348 --> 00:13:17,628
(Wedding)

227
00:13:28,039 --> 00:13:29,039
This sister of mine!

228
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:32,000
Yun Rong,

229
00:13:32,080 --> 00:13:33,232
have you seen Qian Qian?

230
00:13:34,919 --> 00:13:35,919
No.

231
00:13:37,200 --> 00:13:39,152
Did she hang out with Xue Han Yu again?

232
00:13:39,640 --> 00:13:41,953
It's such an important day. He should be here too.

233
00:13:43,159 --> 00:13:44,159
Tian.

234
00:13:46,359 --> 00:13:47,472
Tian,

235
00:13:47,760 --> 00:13:49,073
have you seen Xue Han Yu?

236
00:13:49,479 --> 00:13:51,873
Mr. Xue doesn't like that Yuan Bao is getting married.

237
00:13:52,039 --> 00:13:53,193
He went drinking last night.

238
00:13:53,559 --> 00:13:54,592
Right now,

239
00:13:54,840 --> 00:13:56,032
he should still be asleep.

240
00:13:56,280 --> 00:13:58,120
By the way, isn't your sister

241
00:13:58,200 --> 00:13:59,552
with him?

242
00:14:06,159 --> 00:14:07,953
Enter the hall.

243
00:14:14,119 --> 00:14:15,393
You may perform the ritual.

244
00:14:15,559 --> 00:14:16,873
First bow to heaven and earth.

245
00:14:25,599 --> 00:14:26,953
Second bow to the parents.

246
00:14:31,679 --> 00:14:32,873
Bow to each other.

247
00:14:39,159 --> 00:14:40,159
Wait!

248
00:14:49,119 --> 00:14:50,119
Chang Yue?

249
00:14:51,119 --> 00:14:52,152
You dare to come here?

250
00:15:00,039 --> 00:15:01,472
Yuan Bao, step back.

251
00:15:02,239 --> 00:15:03,239
I'll protect you.

252
00:15:27,280 --> 00:15:29,953
You think you're strong enough to protect her?

253
00:15:30,239 --> 00:15:31,239
Shu Ya.

254
00:15:47,200 --> 00:15:48,687
- Shu Ya!   - Shu Ya!

255
00:15:49,200 --> 00:15:50,839
- Shu Ya!   - Shu Ya!

256
00:15:50,919 --> 00:15:51,919
- Are you okay?   - Yuan Bao.

257
00:15:51,992 --> 00:15:52,992
I'm okay.

258
00:15:53,440 --> 00:15:55,433
I promised I would protect you forever.

259
00:15:56,320 --> 00:15:57,472
Even if it means death,

260
00:15:57,960 --> 00:15:59,873
I won't let him hurt you in the slightest.

261
00:16:00,465 --> 00:16:01,818
(He is willing to die for you.)

262
00:16:02,760 --> 00:16:04,032
(What more can I ask for?)

263
00:16:05,119 --> 00:16:06,472
You fox demon.

264
00:16:07,039 --> 00:16:08,120
You've killed countless people.

265
00:16:08,200 --> 00:16:09,279
And now, you want to kill

266
00:16:09,359 --> 00:16:10,873
Young Master Huo and his bride.

267
00:16:11,159 --> 00:16:12,159
Don't let him get away.

268
00:16:12,880 --> 00:16:13,880
Wait!

269
00:16:35,039 --> 00:16:36,039
Is it done?

270
00:16:36,359 --> 00:16:38,120
- Done.   - Very well.

271
00:16:38,200 --> 00:16:40,232
How dare he tied me up? When I get out, I'll kill him!

272
00:16:41,181 --> 00:16:42,440
You idiot! Stop using

273
00:16:42,520 --> 00:16:43,520
violence for everything.

274
00:16:43,600 --> 00:16:44,639
What do we do if we can't

275
00:16:44,732 --> 00:16:45,732
- beat them?   - I don't know.

276
00:16:46,679 --> 00:16:49,000
I don't mind dying here. But Yuan Bao's life will be ruined soon.

277
00:16:49,080 --> 00:16:50,112
What do we do now?

278
00:16:52,539 --> 00:16:54,352
It won't stump this big brain of mine.

279
00:16:58,559 --> 00:16:59,559
Come.

280
00:17:08,560 --> 00:17:09,999
Easy peasy.

281
00:17:10,079 --> 00:17:11,513
What kind of powder is this? It's amazing.

282
00:17:11,800 --> 00:17:12,832
This powder is called...

283
00:17:14,995 --> 00:17:16,301
Never mind. I forgot.

284
00:17:16,399 --> 00:17:17,604
Anyway, it's from Yuan Bao.

285
00:17:17,685 --> 00:17:19,597
It is enough to knock them out for a whole day.

286
00:17:28,485 --> 00:17:29,485
A whole day, you say?

287
00:17:32,760 --> 00:17:34,439
It's been a while. Perhaps it's expired.

288
00:17:34,719 --> 00:17:35,719
Let's go.

289
00:17:54,066 --> 00:17:55,066
Chang Yue,

290
00:17:57,479 --> 00:17:58,479
are you here today

291
00:17:59,359 --> 00:18:01,112
to retrieve the soul?

292
00:18:06,640 --> 00:18:07,640
Yes.

293
00:18:09,599 --> 00:18:11,033
What makes you think

294
00:18:11,479 --> 00:18:13,753
you can take the soul from me?

295
00:18:26,839 --> 00:18:28,513
During Qiqiao Festival, at the theater,

296
00:18:30,920 --> 00:18:32,112
did you mean

297
00:18:34,400 --> 00:18:35,873
any of the words you said to me?

298
00:18:43,232 --> 00:18:45,625
You meant them, right?

299
00:18:53,680 --> 00:18:54,680
Do I mean what I said?

300
00:18:56,880 --> 00:18:58,393
You never mean what you said.

301
00:19:01,680 --> 00:19:02,952
What makes you think

302
00:19:03,359 --> 00:19:05,112
I'll mean what I said?

303
00:19:22,760 --> 00:19:23,760
Chang Yue,

304
00:19:24,959 --> 00:19:25,959
this

305
00:19:26,760 --> 00:19:28,112
is my answer.

306
00:19:46,680 --> 00:19:48,232
I know you're heartless,

307
00:19:51,239 --> 00:19:53,072
yet I still believed your words

308
00:19:54,400 --> 00:19:55,873
again and again.

309
00:19:57,760 --> 00:19:59,513
Now I'm suffering the consequences.

310
00:20:01,959 --> 00:20:03,232
I deserve it.

311
00:20:07,239 --> 00:20:08,472
I protected you.

312
00:20:10,640 --> 00:20:11,753
I couldn't bring myself to hurt

313
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:15,432
or deceive you. I've never harmed you.

314
00:20:16,959 --> 00:20:18,072
From the very beginning,

315
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:22,119
I just want to take back

316
00:20:22,199 --> 00:20:23,832
what belongs to me.

317
00:20:27,119 --> 00:20:28,673
What did I do wrong

318
00:20:29,239 --> 00:20:31,393
that you want to kill me?

319
00:20:50,119 --> 00:20:51,592
Even if I approached you

320
00:20:52,599 --> 00:20:53,873
for in tandem cultivation,

321
00:20:56,640 --> 00:20:57,913
weren't the feelings I offered

322
00:21:00,479 --> 00:21:01,952
genuine?

323
00:21:07,640 --> 00:21:09,913
You keep saying I killed your people.

324
00:21:10,719 --> 00:21:12,239
But have you ever asked me

325
00:21:12,319 --> 00:21:13,393
about the truth?

326
00:21:59,760 --> 00:22:00,760
Sect Leader Huo.

327
00:22:03,199 --> 00:22:05,633
You said I was the one who committed the crime at Suiyue Mountain.

328
00:22:07,160 --> 00:22:08,352
Tell me.

329
00:22:09,005 --> 00:22:10,005
That day,

330
00:22:11,160 --> 00:22:12,440
did I hurt your people

331
00:22:12,520 --> 00:22:13,753
even in the slightest?

332
00:22:34,760 --> 00:22:35,760
Chang Yue,

333
00:22:37,239 --> 00:22:38,993
what do you mean by that?

334
00:22:40,119 --> 00:22:42,072
You didn't kill anyone, did you?

335
00:22:43,119 --> 00:22:44,472
Tell me everything.

336
00:22:45,079 --> 00:22:47,393
You didn't kill anyone, did you?

337
00:22:49,640 --> 00:22:51,072
Chang Yue!

338
00:22:51,839 --> 00:22:54,759
- Yuan Bao!   - Chang Yue!

339
00:22:54,839 --> 00:22:56,760
- Yuan Bao!   - Chang Yue!

340
00:22:57,040 --> 00:22:58,040
Chang Yue!

341
00:22:58,199 --> 00:22:59,199
Yuan Bao!

342
00:22:59,359 --> 00:23:00,359
Yuan Bao!

343
00:23:00,400 --> 00:23:01,400
Chang Yue!

344
00:23:01,760 --> 00:23:03,480
- Let go of me. Chang Yue!   - Yuan Bao!

345
00:23:03,560 --> 00:23:04,560
Chang Yue!

346
00:23:21,520 --> 00:23:22,993
Your Highness!

347
00:23:23,959 --> 00:23:24,959
Are you all right?

348
00:23:25,640 --> 00:23:26,640
I'm fine.

349
00:23:27,079 --> 00:23:28,399
Did Qi Yuan Bao hurt you again?

350
00:23:28,479 --> 00:23:29,479
Did she?

351
00:23:31,560 --> 00:23:33,320
That heartless woman.

352
00:23:33,400 --> 00:23:34,753
I'll kill her for you right now!

353
00:23:36,119 --> 00:23:37,119
Return to Beiming.

354
00:23:37,520 --> 00:23:38,520
Your Highness!

355
00:23:38,599 --> 00:23:39,599
Return to Beiming.

356
00:23:49,280 --> 00:23:50,280
Don't marry him!

357
00:23:51,400 --> 00:23:53,239
Yuan Bao, don't marry him.

358
00:23:53,479 --> 00:23:54,479
It's because...

359
00:23:58,959 --> 00:23:59,959
You all knew already?

360
00:24:00,839 --> 00:24:01,952
You villain!

361
00:24:02,040 --> 00:24:03,040
You're shameless!

362
00:24:03,193 --> 00:24:03,938
You...

363
00:24:11,399 --> 00:24:12,102
Yuan Bao,

364
00:24:13,199 --> 00:24:15,153
I orchestrated the whole thing.

365
00:24:16,400 --> 00:24:17,712
Blame me if you want.

366
00:24:19,640 --> 00:24:20,873
Why did you do this?

367
00:24:21,800 --> 00:24:23,952
Do you really not know why I did this?

368
00:24:24,599 --> 00:24:26,952
How have I treated you since we were kids?

369
00:24:27,359 --> 00:24:29,112
I thought you knew that better than anyone.

370
00:24:29,880 --> 00:24:31,673
But ever since that fox demon appeared,

371
00:24:32,280 --> 00:24:33,712
you stopped seeing me.

372
00:24:35,199 --> 00:24:36,873
You only think about him.

373
00:24:41,599 --> 00:24:42,720
I went to Yutao Mountain too

374
00:24:42,800 --> 00:24:43,979
to pick Purple Scale Fruit for you.

375
00:24:44,719 --> 00:24:47,033
But besides a proverbial thank you,

376
00:24:48,680 --> 00:24:50,633
did you show any gratitude?

377
00:24:56,479 --> 00:24:57,712
And that robe,

378
00:24:58,560 --> 00:24:59,952
was it truly meant for me?

379
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:03,633
It was for that fox demon.

380
00:25:04,040 --> 00:25:05,040
You were humiliating me!

381
00:25:05,079 --> 00:25:06,560
You resent me.

382
00:25:06,640 --> 00:25:08,560
Take it out on me. But why did you frame Chang Yue?

383
00:25:08,640 --> 00:25:09,753
Because I'm jealous of him!

384
00:25:11,920 --> 00:25:13,121
He's just a fox.

385
00:25:14,119 --> 00:25:15,352
He deserves to die.

386
00:25:16,199 --> 00:25:17,199
Say that again.

387
00:25:17,280 --> 00:25:18,553
I said he deserved to die.

388
00:25:19,599 --> 00:25:21,072
If I had another chance,

389
00:25:21,640 --> 00:25:22,913
I'd still do the same thing.

390
00:25:30,520 --> 00:25:32,472
You actually hit me for a fox demon.

391
00:25:34,079 --> 00:25:35,432
Qi Yuan Bao, listen up.

392
00:25:36,520 --> 00:25:37,520
Don't forget

393
00:25:38,719 --> 00:25:40,273
you're my wife now.

394
00:25:40,920 --> 00:25:41,920
Wife?

395
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:44,000
Huo Shu Ya,

396
00:25:45,040 --> 00:25:47,080
given that we grew up together,

397
00:25:47,160 --> 00:25:48,160
I won't hurt you.

398
00:25:49,239 --> 00:25:50,513
But you listen to me now.

399
00:25:51,239 --> 00:25:52,239
From now on,

400
00:25:53,079 --> 00:25:55,393
I have nothing to do with you.

401
00:25:56,000 --> 00:25:57,793
If you mention that I'm your wife again,

402
00:25:58,359 --> 00:25:59,633
I won't let you off easily.

403
00:26:00,319 --> 00:26:01,319
Qi Yuan Bao!

404
00:26:09,599 --> 00:26:10,599
Qi Yuan Bao,

405
00:26:12,280 --> 00:26:13,280
remember

406
00:26:14,267 --> 00:26:15,660
that it was you

407
00:26:17,000 --> 00:26:19,072
who stabbed Chang Yue today.

408
00:26:20,680 --> 00:26:22,033
If there is anyone to blame,

409
00:26:22,959 --> 00:26:24,873
the first person you should blame is yourself.

410
00:26:27,852 --> 00:26:28,852
Yes,

411
00:26:29,719 --> 00:26:30,753
you're right.

412
00:26:33,280 --> 00:26:34,280
I stabbed him

413
00:26:35,239 --> 00:26:37,112
myself.

414
00:26:38,439 --> 00:26:39,439
The wounds

415
00:26:39,519 --> 00:26:40,999
all of you inflicted on Chang Yue

416
00:26:41,079 --> 00:26:42,244
are nothing in comparison.

417
00:26:46,839 --> 00:26:49,673
The one who hurt him the most is me.

418
00:26:50,800 --> 00:26:52,793
He treated me with deep affection

419
00:26:53,439 --> 00:26:54,633
and sincerity,

420
00:26:56,079 --> 00:26:57,480
but I foolishly believed

421
00:26:57,560 --> 00:26:58,753
your lies.

422
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:03,633
I've made a grave mistake.

423
00:27:05,040 --> 00:27:06,513
It's all my fault.

424
00:27:09,719 --> 00:27:10,719
Yuan Bao.

425
00:27:42,274 --> 00:27:48,212
(Wedding)

426
00:28:27,119 --> 00:28:28,793
Since it's not meant for me,

427
00:28:30,160 --> 00:28:31,513
then I don't want it anymore.

428
00:28:34,199 --> 00:28:35,199
Qi Yuan Bao.

429
00:28:37,520 --> 00:28:38,673
From now on,

430
00:28:40,239 --> 00:28:42,393
we are done.

431
00:28:57,760 --> 00:28:58,760
(Shu Ya,)

432
00:28:59,000 --> 00:29:00,432
(I put some sugar in this for you.)

433
00:29:00,839 --> 00:29:01,913
(It's not bitter at all.)

434
00:29:02,280 --> 00:29:03,280
(Drink up.)

435
00:29:54,838 --> 00:29:55,371
Young Master Huo,

436
00:29:56,119 --> 00:29:57,440
Qi Yuan Bao has broken your heart.

437
00:29:57,520 --> 00:29:59,112
Don't let her affect you anymore.

438
00:30:02,935 --> 00:30:04,255
I will make them

439
00:30:04,280 --> 00:30:06,232
pay the price.

440
00:30:06,760 --> 00:30:08,352
Qi Yuan Bao has Qi Lian.

441
00:30:08,680 --> 00:30:09,800
Chang Yue will be a heavenly fox

442
00:30:09,880 --> 00:30:10,880
with immense spiritual power.

443
00:30:11,160 --> 00:30:12,366
They are no ordinary people.

444
00:30:13,560 --> 00:30:15,673
I'm afraid they are powerful enemies.

445
00:30:17,206 --> 00:30:19,553
As long as I get the power of the Corpse Puppet King,

446
00:30:21,127 --> 00:30:22,799
I fear no one.

447
00:30:24,880 --> 00:30:25,880
Then,

448
00:30:27,040 --> 00:30:29,273
they will no longer be an issue.

449
00:30:41,040 --> 00:30:42,633
It was supposed to be a happy occasion.

450
00:30:43,400 --> 00:30:45,072
How did it turn out like this?

451
00:30:46,800 --> 00:30:48,352
Take down all the red silk.

452
00:30:49,713 --> 00:30:50,489
Noted.

453
00:31:18,079 --> 00:31:19,192
Chang Yue, I'm sorry.

454
00:31:20,319 --> 00:31:21,319
Chang Yue,

455
00:31:25,040 --> 00:31:26,040
I'm sorry.

456
00:31:43,359 --> 00:31:45,712
I was wrong, Chang Yue.

457
00:31:47,800 --> 00:31:51,753
I'm sorry.

458
00:32:16,400 --> 00:32:18,273
To think a woman would torment

459
00:32:18,640 --> 00:32:20,722
our clan's future heavenly fox so...

460
00:32:21,880 --> 00:32:23,319
The past is dead to me.

461
00:32:24,520 --> 00:32:28,153
I will never make such a foolish mistake again.

462
00:32:29,239 --> 00:32:30,793
What a cruel woman.

463
00:32:31,160 --> 00:32:33,112
She stabbed you in your Heart-Piercing Arrow wound.

464
00:32:33,479 --> 00:32:34,600
You already suffer

465
00:32:34,680 --> 00:32:36,273
unbearable pain every night.

466
00:32:36,640 --> 00:32:38,639
Qi Yuan Bao didn't just make His Highness's wound worse,

467
00:32:38,719 --> 00:32:40,312
she broke his heart too.

468
00:32:40,526 --> 00:32:42,046
- His Highness risked his life...   - Enough.

469
00:32:45,880 --> 00:32:47,352
I'm done with her.

470
00:32:48,719 --> 00:32:49,719
Don't mention her

471
00:32:49,799 --> 00:32:50,799
in front of me again.

472
00:32:53,733 --> 00:32:54,321
Grandmother,

473
00:32:55,359 --> 00:32:58,033
I've thought about the soul.

474
00:32:59,959 --> 00:33:00,718
It's okay.

475
00:33:01,839 --> 00:33:03,522
Let's not talk about it for now.

476
00:33:03,973 --> 00:33:06,447
We'll discuss it again when you're feeling better.

477
00:33:07,680 --> 00:33:10,482
But your wound is getting worse.

478
00:33:10,680 --> 00:33:12,162
We can't let it carry on.

479
00:33:14,640 --> 00:33:16,673
Yi Xuan has returned from Taiyi Mountain.

480
00:33:17,119 --> 00:33:19,040
I'll let her take care of you from now on.

481
00:33:19,359 --> 00:33:20,472
What do you think?

482
00:33:24,520 --> 00:33:25,842
As you wish.
