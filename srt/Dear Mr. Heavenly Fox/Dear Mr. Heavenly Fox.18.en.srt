1
00:01:48,802 --> 00:01:54,012
(Dear Mr. Heavenly Fox)

2
00:01:54,079 --> 00:01:57,019
(Episode 18)

3
00:02:43,685 --> 00:02:45,922
(Chang Yue, let's sit here.)

4
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:07,273
Chang Yue, I really, really like you.

5
00:03:07,520 --> 00:03:09,082
(You've already said)

6
00:03:09,880 --> 00:03:11,562
(those sweet things ten times.)

7
00:03:17,400 --> 00:03:18,682
(Now,)

8
00:03:18,880 --> 00:03:20,362
(you have flowers too.)

9
00:03:26,457 --> 00:03:28,082
(Do you mean)

10
00:03:28,665 --> 00:03:30,642
(what you said to me?)

11
00:03:33,320 --> 00:03:34,562
(This)

12
00:03:35,199 --> 00:03:36,842
(is my answer.)

13
00:03:38,320 --> 00:03:40,122
What did I do wrong

14
00:03:40,383 --> 00:03:42,962
that you want to kill me?

15
00:03:44,320 --> 00:03:47,082
(You keep saying I killed your people,)

16
00:03:47,240 --> 00:03:50,562
(but have you ever asked me about the truth?)

17
00:03:52,039 --> 00:03:54,002
(Even if I approached you)

18
00:03:54,582 --> 00:03:56,242
(for the in-tandem cultivation,)

19
00:03:58,582 --> 00:04:00,362
(weren't the feelings I offered)

20
00:04:02,527 --> 00:04:04,023
(genuine?)

21
00:04:13,002 --> 00:04:16,919
(Beixuan Inn)

22
00:04:20,059 --> 00:04:22,202
(Beixuan inn)

23
00:04:27,761 --> 00:04:29,621
(Girls shouldn't eat these things.)

24
00:04:29,732 --> 00:04:31,285
(It's uncouth.)

25
00:04:31,440 --> 00:04:33,282
(I don't eat them.)

26
00:04:33,918 --> 00:04:35,402
(But I like them.)

27
00:04:37,414 --> 00:04:38,145
Try it.

28
00:04:44,160 --> 00:04:46,153
- We'll come again.   - You'll have it today.

29
00:04:47,880 --> 00:04:49,159
Isn't that the traitor, Qi Yuan Bao?

30
00:04:49,228 --> 00:04:49,948
That's her.

31
00:04:52,559 --> 00:04:53,560
She is a traitor, all right.

32
00:04:53,739 --> 00:04:54,800
She can enjoy her meal

33
00:04:54,880 --> 00:04:56,473
because she doesn't have a conscience.

34
00:04:57,200 --> 00:04:59,225
She killed our loved ones

35
00:04:59,399 --> 00:05:00,840
and she dares to parade around in public.

36
00:05:00,920 --> 00:05:01,993
Go back to Qishan Sect

37
00:05:02,320 --> 00:05:04,313
Or we'll kick you out.

38
00:05:04,559 --> 00:05:06,352
She is bewitched by the fox demon

39
00:05:06,600 --> 00:05:08,392
and still hasn't come to her senses.

40
00:05:11,519 --> 00:05:13,153
Chang Yue is not a fox demon.

41
00:05:14,160 --> 00:05:15,832
Chang Yue didn't kill anyone.

42
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:19,560
Chang Yue is not a fox demon.

43
00:05:19,640 --> 00:05:21,153
He is not a fox demon.

44
00:05:21,839 --> 00:05:22,839
Traitor!

45
00:05:26,640 --> 00:05:28,112
Chang Yue is not a fox demon.

46
00:05:28,720 --> 00:05:30,153
Chang Yue didn't kill anyone.

47
00:05:30,880 --> 00:05:32,392
Chang Yue is not a fox demon.

48
00:05:32,519 --> 00:05:33,561
- Look.   - What are you doing?

49
00:05:33,641 --> 00:05:34,753
Chang Yue didn't kill anyone.

50
00:05:35,359 --> 00:05:36,359
Back off!

51
00:05:36,799 --> 00:05:38,672
- Let's go.   - Yuan Bao.

52
00:05:40,320 --> 00:05:41,320
Pull yourself together.

53
00:05:41,799 --> 00:05:43,392
Chang Yue didn't kill anyone.

54
00:05:43,760 --> 00:05:44,760
Yuan Bao.

55
00:05:45,079 --> 00:05:46,279
Chang Yue is not a fox demon.

56
00:05:46,359 --> 00:05:47,359
Yuan Bao.

57
00:05:48,279 --> 00:05:49,753
Chang Yue didn't kill anyone.

58
00:05:50,519 --> 00:05:53,072
- Yuan Bao.   - Chang Yue is not a fox demon.

59
00:05:56,160 --> 00:05:57,160
Chang Yue.

60
00:06:04,399 --> 00:06:05,800
I can't bear to see you

61
00:06:05,880 --> 00:06:07,313
all crestfallen like this.

62
00:06:08,760 --> 00:06:09,760
But do you think you can erase

63
00:06:10,239 --> 00:06:12,593
your guilt towards Chang Yue by doing this?

64
00:06:15,880 --> 00:06:18,153
If you think Chang Yue is innocent,

65
00:06:18,628 --> 00:06:20,309
buck up and find the real killer.

66
00:06:20,416 --> 00:06:23,760
Clear his name and give our people an explanation

67
00:06:23,920 --> 00:06:26,103
so that those who died unjustly can rest in peace.

68
00:06:26,239 --> 00:06:28,832
This is what is expected of the heiress of Qishan Sect,

69
00:06:41,160 --> 00:06:43,593
and also of the Yuan Bao who makes me proud.

70
00:06:56,200 --> 00:06:57,720
Your Highness, it is done.

71
00:07:00,200 --> 00:07:01,200
Thank you.

72
00:07:08,959 --> 00:07:09,959
Chang Yue,

73
00:07:10,160 --> 00:07:11,633
if you need anything in the future,

74
00:07:11,959 --> 00:07:13,832
just go to Yi Xuan.

75
00:07:16,880 --> 00:07:17,880
Oh, right,

76
00:07:18,040 --> 00:07:19,040
This is for you.

77
00:07:21,279 --> 00:07:22,279
What is this?

78
00:07:22,640 --> 00:07:24,033
Your spiritual power is depleted.

79
00:07:24,279 --> 00:07:25,993
I've made some Invigorating Floral Honey.

80
00:07:26,320 --> 00:07:28,792
Drink it and it can temporarily relieve your pain

81
00:07:29,040 --> 00:07:30,193
and restore your spiritual power.

82
00:07:34,679 --> 00:07:35,679
Thank you.

83
00:07:39,079 --> 00:07:40,079
Yi Xuan.

84
00:07:40,920 --> 00:07:42,633
This is very thoughtful of you.

85
00:07:46,399 --> 00:07:47,593
It's my duty.

86
00:07:48,239 --> 00:07:50,400
It seems His Highness views

87
00:07:50,480 --> 00:07:51,480
Miss Yi Xuan differently.

88
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:53,552
How so?

89
00:07:53,880 --> 00:07:56,512
Before this, His Highness wouldn't let anyone touch him.

90
00:07:56,760 --> 00:07:58,480
But now, Miss Yi Xuan can dress

91
00:07:58,560 --> 00:08:00,193
His Highness's wounds.

92
00:08:00,894 --> 00:08:02,054
In the past, Grandmother Bi Xi

93
00:08:02,079 --> 00:08:04,471
could never bring a woman into His Highness's palace.

94
00:08:04,496 --> 00:08:06,015
But now, His Highness has agreed

95
00:08:06,040 --> 00:08:07,279
to let Miss Yi Xuan in.

96
00:08:07,359 --> 00:08:08,359
What do you know?

97
00:08:08,559 --> 00:08:10,640
His Highness is heartbroken.

98
00:08:10,720 --> 00:08:12,153
That's why he's become like this.

99
00:08:13,247 --> 00:08:14,754
In short, this is all the fault

100
00:08:14,834 --> 00:08:16,464
of that heartless,

101
00:08:16,544 --> 00:08:17,657
ungrateful woman.

102
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:19,675
Grandmother Bi Xi,

103
00:08:20,519 --> 00:08:22,473
I'll get going.

104
00:08:39,599 --> 00:08:40,833
Yi Xuan is quite

105
00:08:41,080 --> 00:08:42,472
attentive to you.

106
00:08:46,559 --> 00:08:47,559
Grandmother Bi Xi,

107
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:49,712
any discovery about

108
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:51,000
the Phantom Fox Darts?

109
00:08:51,359 --> 00:08:53,433
I've checked the access records of the treasury,

110
00:08:54,239 --> 00:08:55,672
but they've all been erased.

111
00:08:57,280 --> 00:08:58,633
The culprit was cautious.

112
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:03,039
There are very few people who can enter the treasury.

113
00:09:04,200 --> 00:09:05,200
Who could it be?

114
00:09:15,760 --> 00:09:18,393
I've made you worry these past few days.

115
00:09:19,880 --> 00:09:20,880
I knew

116
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:23,433
my daughter wouldn't disappoint me.

117
00:09:28,576 --> 00:09:31,200
Actually, there's something

118
00:09:31,280 --> 00:09:33,032
I haven't been able to figure out.

119
00:09:33,599 --> 00:09:35,259
What is it? Tell me.

120
00:09:37,200 --> 00:09:38,232
These days,

121
00:09:38,359 --> 00:09:40,193
many innocent people have died in the city.

122
00:09:40,400 --> 00:09:42,552
What do you think the real killer's purpose is?

123
00:09:43,239 --> 00:09:45,193
Did they want to frame Chang Yue

124
00:09:46,479 --> 00:09:47,680
and create a conflict between us

125
00:09:47,760 --> 00:09:49,032
and him?

126
00:09:49,239 --> 00:09:50,239
No.

127
00:09:50,627 --> 00:09:51,627
To be precise,

128
00:09:51,799 --> 00:09:52,799
it's to create

129
00:09:53,119 --> 00:09:55,112
a conflict between you and Chang Yue.

130
00:09:55,479 --> 00:09:57,320
Father, what do you mean by that?

131
00:09:57,640 --> 00:09:58,299
Yuan Bao, have you ever heard

132
00:09:59,320 --> 00:10:00,352
of the rumors

133
00:10:00,520 --> 00:10:02,513
the Corpse Puppet King and the spirit particle?

134
00:10:05,599 --> 00:10:06,599
According to the rumors,

135
00:10:06,799 --> 00:10:08,200
the Corpse Puppet King possesses

136
00:10:08,280 --> 00:10:09,472
immense power

137
00:10:09,675 --> 00:10:12,712
He brings disaster to the world as soon as he appears.

138
00:10:16,405 --> 00:10:17,405
What?

139
00:10:18,559 --> 00:10:19,559
Father, do you mean

140
00:10:19,840 --> 00:10:21,032
that I am the spirit particle?

141
00:10:21,559 --> 00:10:22,760
who can save the world

142
00:10:22,840 --> 00:10:24,792
in the legend?

143
00:10:25,259 --> 00:10:26,259
That's right.

144
00:10:27,089 --> 00:10:28,089
Father,

145
00:10:28,119 --> 00:10:29,352
are you sure you're not mistaken?

146
00:10:31,359 --> 00:10:33,032
I wish it were a misunderstanding.

147
00:10:34,719 --> 00:10:36,472
If I'm not mistaken,

148
00:10:37,119 --> 00:10:40,603
they did everything to create a conflict between you and Chang Yue

149
00:10:40,684 --> 00:10:42,038
so that Chang Yue

150
00:10:42,205 --> 00:10:43,618
cannot retrieve the soul from you.

151
00:10:44,267 --> 00:10:45,172
That way, they can take you

152
00:10:45,501 --> 00:10:47,201
to Suiyue Mountain to be offered

153
00:10:47,336 --> 00:10:48,428
to the Corpse Puppet King.

154
00:10:50,440 --> 00:10:54,429
So, the culprit is coveting the power of the Corpse Puppet King?

155
00:10:54,549 --> 00:10:55,882
That's right.

156
00:10:56,827 --> 00:10:59,202
Before this, I asked Huo Chen about it.

157
00:10:59,520 --> 00:11:01,712
He was dragged into this because he trespassed into the mausoleum

158
00:11:01,919 --> 00:11:03,193
of the Corpse Puppet King.

159
00:11:04,799 --> 00:11:08,639
They are doing this to silence him and to seize

160
00:11:08,750 --> 00:11:10,602
the Corpse Puppet King.

161
00:11:13,840 --> 00:11:14,840
Father, on the day

162
00:11:14,975 --> 00:11:16,479
the Evil-cleansing Formation was triggered,

163
00:11:16,559 --> 00:11:17,912
although we didn't catch the culprit,

164
00:11:18,599 --> 00:11:20,152
we can confirm that no one

165
00:11:20,440 --> 00:11:21,440
entered or left

166
00:11:21,520 --> 00:11:22,833
our sect. Is that right?

167
00:11:24,840 --> 00:11:25,840
That's right.

168
00:11:26,679 --> 00:11:28,599
Furthermore, regarding my marriage to Huo Shu Ya,

169
00:11:28,960 --> 00:11:29,960
if someone hadn't used

170
00:11:30,040 --> 00:11:31,313
the deaths of the people to fuel

171
00:11:31,486 --> 00:11:34,838
the rumors that I colluded with the fox demon,

172
00:11:35,080 --> 00:11:38,442
Huo Shu Ya and I wouldn't have fallen out.

173
00:11:40,062 --> 00:11:41,882
This person knows us inside and out.

174
00:11:42,320 --> 00:11:43,320
Father.

175
00:11:44,280 --> 00:11:46,042
If I'm not mistaken,

176
00:11:46,324 --> 00:11:49,723
this person must be hiding among us.

177
00:11:56,919 --> 00:11:57,953
You're right.

178
00:11:59,039 --> 00:12:00,273
How could I not have thought of that?

179
00:12:01,280 --> 00:12:02,639
Yuan Bao, you're smart.

180
00:12:02,719 --> 00:12:04,513
Is there a way to find the real culprit?

181
00:12:05,960 --> 00:12:07,672
It's not hard to find the culprit.

182
00:12:07,919 --> 00:12:09,000
If I go to Suiyue Mountain,

183
00:12:09,080 --> 00:12:10,193
the culprit will show themselves.

184
00:12:11,719 --> 00:12:12,719
Suiyue Mountain?

185
00:12:13,679 --> 00:12:15,672
But there's one thing I don't understand.

186
00:12:16,159 --> 00:12:17,159
How come this person possesses

187
00:12:17,679 --> 00:12:19,152
the fox clan's Phantom Fox Darts?

188
00:12:22,320 --> 00:12:24,032
This is my biggest concern too.

189
00:12:24,719 --> 00:12:25,953
Although Chang Yue is innocent,

190
00:12:26,479 --> 00:12:27,519
we don't know if there are

191
00:12:27,599 --> 00:12:28,712
traitors within the fox clan.

192
00:12:29,359 --> 00:12:31,112
If humans and foxes are colluding,

193
00:12:31,479 --> 00:12:32,479
then the world

194
00:12:33,520 --> 00:12:34,520
might...

195
00:12:36,799 --> 00:12:37,799
In that case, I have to

196
00:12:38,760 --> 00:12:40,352
personally go to Beiming.

197
00:12:42,679 --> 00:12:44,313
They won't let you have your way.

198
00:12:46,612 --> 00:12:48,032
They want me to go to Suiyue Mountain.

199
00:12:48,280 --> 00:12:49,280
I can do that.

200
00:12:49,559 --> 00:12:51,152
I'll do as they wish.

201
00:12:51,280 --> 00:12:52,280
You...

202
00:13:08,520 --> 00:13:09,560
His Highness has been lying

203
00:13:09,640 --> 00:13:11,073
on this day for one whole day.

204
00:13:11,799 --> 00:13:13,273
Did something happen?

205
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:18,000
Let's go.

206
00:13:21,280 --> 00:13:23,080
Your Highness, what's going on?

207
00:13:35,919 --> 00:13:36,993
The barrier is shaking again.

208
00:13:37,760 --> 00:13:39,712
It's happening more and more often recently.

209
00:13:39,960 --> 00:13:41,032
If it keeps shaking like this,

210
00:13:41,239 --> 00:13:42,513
the barrier will break soon.

211
00:13:42,799 --> 00:13:43,953
It's all that Qi Yuan Bao's fault.

212
00:13:44,200 --> 00:13:45,479
If she hadn't suddenly appeared

213
00:13:45,559 --> 00:13:46,712
and taken your soul,

214
00:13:46,960 --> 00:13:48,440
you would have ascended by now

215
00:13:48,520 --> 00:13:49,953
and reinforced the Beiming Barrier.

216
00:13:50,239 --> 00:13:51,273
Ascension

217
00:13:52,320 --> 00:13:53,360
isn't the only way

218
00:13:53,440 --> 00:13:54,440
to reinforce the barrier.

219
00:13:54,640 --> 00:13:56,520
Right. You said

220
00:13:56,760 --> 00:13:58,073
Beiming Fables mentioned another way.

221
00:13:58,200 --> 00:13:59,200
What is it?

222
00:14:04,119 --> 00:14:05,873
If the heavenly fox fails to ascend,

223
00:14:06,119 --> 00:14:07,993
they can sacrifice and refine their power

224
00:14:08,239 --> 00:14:09,239
and body

225
00:14:09,520 --> 00:14:11,433
at Lixian Terrace for twenty days

226
00:14:12,280 --> 00:14:13,912
to forge a brand new barrier.

227
00:14:14,359 --> 00:14:16,032
The new barrier would be as solid

228
00:14:16,633 --> 00:14:18,473
as a fortress, and could last for a hundred years.

229
00:14:20,320 --> 00:14:21,960
Your Highness, don't tell me you...

230
00:14:25,080 --> 00:14:26,320
It is indeed time.

231
00:14:26,400 --> 00:14:27,400
Your Highness!

232
00:14:50,760 --> 00:14:51,760
What are you doing here?

233
00:14:52,919 --> 00:14:53,919
What are you making?

234
00:14:54,080 --> 00:14:55,080
I'm brewing chicken soup.

235
00:14:55,520 --> 00:14:58,561
Recently, Yuan Bao has lost a lot of weight because of Mr. Chang Yue.

236
00:14:58,641 --> 00:14:59,880
I'm making her some chicken soup.

237
00:14:59,960 --> 00:15:00,960
Here. Smell it.

238
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:02,000
Does it smell good?

239
00:15:07,840 --> 00:15:08,840
It's missing something.

240
00:15:09,359 --> 00:15:10,359
Wait.

241
00:15:11,960 --> 00:15:14,232
You're so nice to Qi Yuan Bao.

242
00:15:14,880 --> 00:15:15,880
Of course.

243
00:15:16,599 --> 00:15:18,120
Oh, unless it's

244
00:15:18,200 --> 00:15:19,200
something special,

245
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:21,792
it's best if we don't meet too often.

246
00:15:23,159 --> 00:15:24,159
After all,

247
00:15:24,280 --> 00:15:25,953
Yuan Bao just got her heart broken.

248
00:15:26,119 --> 00:15:27,393
With Chang Yue gone,

249
00:15:27,562 --> 00:15:28,639
she's all alone.

250
00:15:28,719 --> 00:15:29,719
If we still show up

251
00:15:29,799 --> 00:15:30,993
like a couple,

252
00:15:31,200 --> 00:15:32,513
she'll definitely be in a bad mood.

253
00:15:33,880 --> 00:15:34,880
Okay.

254
00:15:41,840 --> 00:15:42,840
You agreed?

255
00:15:47,440 --> 00:15:48,552
When did you

256
00:15:48,947 --> 00:15:50,672
become this agreeable?

257
00:15:55,919 --> 00:15:57,032
I'm going back to Suyun City.

258
00:16:02,880 --> 00:16:03,880
I'm leaving tomorrow.

259
00:16:21,159 --> 00:16:22,273
But why?

260
00:16:23,159 --> 00:16:24,159
Didn't we agree

261
00:16:24,200 --> 00:16:26,080
to go to Suiyue Mountain tomorrow to investigate?

262
00:16:26,160 --> 00:16:27,313
Why are you crying?

263
00:16:28,359 --> 00:16:30,393
Father said I was weak

264
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:32,433
and that I'd only hold everyone back.

265
00:16:33,119 --> 00:16:34,912
So he wouldn't let me come.

266
00:16:37,840 --> 00:16:39,120
It's fine. Isn't this

267
00:16:39,200 --> 00:16:40,200
what you want?

268
00:16:40,320 --> 00:16:41,320
In the future,

269
00:16:41,559 --> 00:16:42,833
I won't bother you anymore.

270
00:16:43,440 --> 00:16:45,712
Yuan Bao won't be unhappy because of me.

271
00:16:47,080 --> 00:16:48,080
All right.

272
00:16:49,159 --> 00:16:50,159
Goodbye.

273
00:17:01,799 --> 00:17:02,799
Wait.

274
00:17:03,080 --> 00:17:04,432
Qian Qian.

275
00:17:05,680 --> 00:17:06,680
Qian Qian.

276
00:17:07,040 --> 00:17:08,399
Wait for me.

277
00:17:08,479 --> 00:17:09,479
What?

278
00:17:14,160 --> 00:17:15,160
Take this.

279
00:17:36,839 --> 00:17:38,673
Although I don't know what happened,

280
00:17:39,640 --> 00:17:40,640
I promise you

281
00:17:41,239 --> 00:17:42,673
as soon as I get back from Suiyue Mountain,

282
00:17:43,040 --> 00:17:44,832
I'll go to Suyun City to find you.

283
00:17:51,232 --> 00:17:52,232
You promise?

284
00:17:52,439 --> 00:17:53,439
I promise.

285
00:17:54,400 --> 00:17:55,673
You also promised

286
00:17:56,119 --> 00:17:58,153
you'd treat me to the best roasted duck,

287
00:17:58,400 --> 00:17:59,432
the most delicious flat bread,

288
00:17:59,640 --> 00:18:01,112
and the most mouth-watering roasted goose.

289
00:18:01,319 --> 00:18:02,319
I still remember that.

290
00:18:03,760 --> 00:18:04,793
You can't take those back.

291
00:18:09,040 --> 00:18:10,040
Okay.

292
00:18:10,800 --> 00:18:11,800
Don't break your promise then.

293
00:18:13,599 --> 00:18:14,599
I won't break my promise.

294
00:18:16,719 --> 00:18:17,719
Let's make a pinky promise.

295
00:18:34,280 --> 00:18:35,393
I won't lie to you.

296
00:18:35,880 --> 00:18:37,513
Whoever lies is a piggy.

297
00:18:48,839 --> 00:18:49,913
Whoever lies is a piggy.

298
00:18:51,400 --> 00:18:53,159
Don't use piggy. Piggy is cute.

299
00:18:53,239 --> 00:18:54,239
You're a swine.

300
00:19:03,760 --> 00:19:05,201
- Hurry.   - Lift it over there.

301
00:19:05,281 --> 00:19:06,633
Be careful.

302
00:19:06,920 --> 00:19:07,920
You back there, hurry up.

303
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:09,000
We're leaving soon.

304
00:19:09,119 --> 00:19:10,440
- Okay.   - Hurry up.

305
00:19:10,520 --> 00:19:11,712
Quick. Keep up.

306
00:19:11,920 --> 00:19:13,293
- Okay.   - Hurry.

307
00:19:14,312 --> 00:19:15,312
- This way.   - Okay.

308
00:19:16,239 --> 00:19:18,472
Qi Huan, why isn't Yuan Bao out yet?

309
00:19:18,920 --> 00:19:19,920
I'll go check.

310
00:19:20,119 --> 00:19:21,119
- Okay.   - She's here.

311
00:19:24,880 --> 00:19:25,880
Careful.

312
00:19:27,400 --> 00:19:28,400
Uncle Qi.

313
00:19:48,640 --> 00:19:50,321
Why is Yuan Bao wearing a hat today?

314
00:19:50,401 --> 00:19:52,273
Because she met a jerk

315
00:19:52,373 --> 00:19:53,373
and is heartbroken.

316
00:19:53,800 --> 00:19:55,072
Her eyes are all swollen from crying.

317
00:20:09,560 --> 00:20:10,258
Qi.

318
00:20:10,880 --> 00:20:12,519
Everyone's here. We can leave now.

319
00:20:12,599 --> 00:20:14,153
Okay. Let's go.

320
00:20:14,640 --> 00:20:15,403
Grandmother Bi Xi!

321
00:20:15,760 --> 00:20:17,159
This is bad, Grandmother Bi Xi.

322
00:20:17,239 --> 00:20:18,239
What happened this time?

323
00:20:18,264 --> 00:20:20,056
His Highness went to Lixian Terrace.

324
00:20:20,191 --> 00:20:22,153
He's going to sacrifice himself to strengthen the barrier.

325
00:20:22,520 --> 00:20:23,520
What?

326
00:20:43,400 --> 00:20:44,400
Chang Yue.

327
00:20:46,280 --> 00:20:47,280
Chang Yue.

328
00:20:47,726 --> 00:20:48,726
What are you doing?

329
00:20:49,400 --> 00:20:50,572
Quit being willful.

330
00:21:11,160 --> 00:21:12,160
Grandmother Bi Xi.

331
00:21:13,640 --> 00:21:15,393
I am the future heavenly fox.

332
00:21:15,920 --> 00:21:17,553
Instead of carrying out my duty,

333
00:21:18,319 --> 00:21:19,553
I lost my soul.

334
00:21:20,640 --> 00:21:22,153
This is unforgivable.

335
00:21:23,760 --> 00:21:25,033
And now, my ascension

336
00:21:25,560 --> 00:21:26,560
is no longer possible.

337
00:21:27,839 --> 00:21:29,312
I will sacrifice myself

338
00:21:30,160 --> 00:21:31,160
to strengthen the barrier.

339
00:21:33,239 --> 00:21:34,239
If you do this,

340
00:21:34,280 --> 00:21:35,873
you'll cease to exist.

341
00:21:36,719 --> 00:21:37,719
Strengthening the barrier

342
00:21:40,280 --> 00:21:41,592
and protecting the fox clan

343
00:21:45,119 --> 00:21:46,232
are my duties.

344
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:30,592
This is my final decision.

345
00:23:05,599 --> 00:23:06,599
Your Highness,

346
00:23:06,640 --> 00:23:08,320
there must be another way.

347
00:23:08,400 --> 00:23:09,400
Chang Yue!

348
00:23:09,920 --> 00:23:10,920
Grandmother Bi Xi.

349
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:28,000
Chang Yue!

350
00:23:29,079 --> 00:23:30,079
Grandmother Bi Xi.

351
00:23:30,280 --> 00:23:32,112
Are we going to let His Highness sacrifice himself?

352
00:23:32,719 --> 00:23:34,072
I'm going to stop him now.

353
00:23:35,920 --> 00:23:36,920
No need.

354
00:23:41,119 --> 00:23:43,952
I know Chang Yue's personality best.

355
00:23:45,479 --> 00:23:46,592
Once he's made up his mind,

356
00:23:47,560 --> 00:23:48,993
no one can stop him.

357
00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:00,472
No, I'm still worried about him.

358
00:24:00,839 --> 00:24:01,839
I'm going to check on him.

359
00:25:04,359 --> 00:25:05,680
Aunt Meng Shu, are we really going to

360
00:25:05,760 --> 00:25:08,232
just watch Chang Yue sacrifice himself?

361
00:25:10,520 --> 00:25:11,520
Of course, not.

362
00:25:13,479 --> 00:25:14,592
Do you have a solution?

363
00:25:16,640 --> 00:25:17,640
I don't.

364
00:25:21,560 --> 00:25:24,553
But someone does.

365
00:25:49,520 --> 00:25:50,753
Finally, we managed to fool them.

366
00:25:52,959 --> 00:25:54,472
Didn't you say you were leaving yesterday?

367
00:25:55,239 --> 00:25:56,639
I was going to leave.

368
00:25:56,719 --> 00:25:57,800
I was about to walk out

369
00:25:57,880 --> 00:25:59,560
of the Qishan Sect entrance.

370
00:25:59,695 --> 00:26:01,375
Who knew that Qi Yuan Bao

371
00:26:01,400 --> 00:26:03,159
would suddenly kneel in front of me

372
00:26:03,239 --> 00:26:04,759
and say she couldn't live without me?

373
00:26:04,839 --> 00:26:05,879
That's why I came back.

374
00:26:05,959 --> 00:26:06,959
All right.

375
00:26:08,319 --> 00:26:09,920
So? My acting was good, right?

376
00:26:10,160 --> 00:26:11,160
Isn't it better than

377
00:26:11,199 --> 00:26:12,010
Qi Yuan Bao?

378
00:26:13,439 --> 00:26:14,439
You did very well.

379
00:26:14,880 --> 00:26:15,880
Of course.

380
00:26:23,479 --> 00:26:25,119
What are you doing? Don't look. It's dangerous.

381
00:26:25,199 --> 00:26:26,513
It's not that easy to get caught.

382
00:26:27,760 --> 00:26:29,080
Your father and sister are here.

383
00:26:29,160 --> 00:26:30,160
Be careful.

384
00:26:32,119 --> 00:26:33,192
You have a point.

385
00:26:33,760 --> 00:26:34,760
If Father finds out

386
00:26:34,839 --> 00:26:36,112
I didn't return to Suyun City,

387
00:26:36,479 --> 00:26:37,479
I'll be dead.

388
00:26:39,920 --> 00:26:42,600
But this bait-and-switch tactic of Yuan Bao's

389
00:26:42,680 --> 00:26:44,033
is brilliant.

390
00:26:44,239 --> 00:26:45,480
Everyone is focusing

391
00:26:45,560 --> 00:26:46,560
on us

392
00:26:46,839 --> 00:26:48,712
so she can go to Beiming safely.

393
00:26:50,319 --> 00:26:51,913
She went to Beiming.

394
00:26:52,119 --> 00:26:53,879
Did she say when she'd return to Suiyue Mountain?

395
00:26:53,959 --> 00:26:55,633
I can't keep impersonating her forever, can I?

396
00:26:56,520 --> 00:26:57,600
She said to do this for a while.

397
00:26:57,686 --> 00:26:58,987
- How long?   - A month.

398
00:26:59,839 --> 00:27:00,839
What?

399
00:27:01,879 --> 00:27:03,340
What the heck? Keep it down.

400
00:27:03,880 --> 00:27:04,880
A month?

401
00:27:05,439 --> 00:27:06,439
What's wrong with one month?

402
00:27:06,520 --> 00:27:07,520
I...

403
00:27:10,479 --> 00:27:11,479
Are you crazy?

404
00:28:58,959 --> 00:29:00,273
In four days, His Highness will...

405
00:29:30,280 --> 00:29:31,280
After today,

406
00:29:31,439 --> 00:29:33,439
is His Highness going to leave us forever?

407
00:29:34,040 --> 00:29:35,952
I can't bear to see His Highness go.

408
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:43,000
According to the map,

409
00:30:43,319 --> 00:30:44,592
it should be here.

410
00:30:48,560 --> 00:30:49,560
Where's Beiming?

411
00:30:50,920 --> 00:30:51,920
Did I take the wrong turn?

412
00:30:59,400 --> 00:31:01,352
Your Highness!

413
00:31:19,239 --> 00:31:20,239
(Qi Yuan Bao.)

414
00:31:20,680 --> 00:31:22,153
(You've walked right into my trap.)

415
00:31:22,680 --> 00:31:24,472
(I'll torture you with the pain of love)

416
00:31:25,119 --> 00:31:27,673
(until you wish you were dead.)

417
00:31:32,359 --> 00:31:33,359
This is...

418
00:32:02,732 --> 00:32:04,332
- Who...   - Who is she?

419
00:32:04,475 --> 00:32:06,124
She's Qi Yuan Bao.

420
00:32:06,920 --> 00:32:08,279
The woman who took

421
00:32:08,359 --> 00:32:09,472
His Highness's soul.

422
00:32:10,252 --> 00:32:11,266
Great!

423
00:32:11,719 --> 00:32:12,539
She's here.

424
00:32:12,738 --> 00:32:14,171
Does that mean His Highness no longer

425
00:32:14,479 --> 00:32:15,753
has to sacrifice himself anymore?

426
00:32:29,199 --> 00:32:30,199
Chang Yue!

427
00:32:36,800 --> 00:32:37,565
Chang Yue.

428
00:32:38,439 --> 00:32:39,832
I finally found you.

429
00:32:44,439 --> 00:32:45,439
I...

430
00:32:46,199 --> 00:32:46,741
Stop right there.

431
00:32:58,439 --> 00:33:00,472
How dare you trespass into Beiming's territory!

432
00:33:08,280 --> 00:33:09,280
Chang Yue.

433
00:33:10,839 --> 00:33:11,839
You want

434
00:33:12,880 --> 00:33:13,880
to kill me?

435
00:33:15,119 --> 00:33:18,232
Don't you deserve death?

436
00:33:24,599 --> 00:33:25,633
I do deserve death.

437
00:33:27,106 --> 00:33:29,658
I shouldn't have listened to those lies

438
00:33:30,319 --> 00:33:30,910
and wronged you.

439
00:33:31,880 --> 00:33:32,913
I shouldn't have doubted you.

440
00:33:33,199 --> 00:33:33,970
I shouldn't have hurt you.

441
00:33:34,103 --> 00:33:35,118
- I...   - Enough!

442
00:33:43,439 --> 00:33:44,439
Chang Yue.

443
00:33:46,959 --> 00:33:48,842
I know you can't bring yourself to do it.
