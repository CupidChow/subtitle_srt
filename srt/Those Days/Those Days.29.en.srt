(Adapted from iceread.com novel
"You Xi" by Qingyang Wanxi)

3
00:01:14,980 --> 00:01:18,130
=Episode 29=

4
00:01:25,640 --> 00:01:26,370
Who in your family

5
00:01:27,880 --> 00:01:29,080
is sick?

6
00:01:32,360 --> 00:01:33,199
My son.

7
00:01:36,440 --> 00:01:38,160
He has a serious illness.

8
00:01:43,360 --> 00:01:44,399
He's my only child.

9
00:01:47,600 --> 00:01:49,800
I have to save him no matter what.

10
00:01:57,160 --> 00:01:58,520
It's expensive in here.

11
00:01:59,880 --> 00:02:01,440
Ten thousand a day.

12
00:02:02,919 --> 00:02:03,960
But what can I do?

13
00:02:05,559 --> 00:02:07,759
Money can't compare to a life.

14
00:02:10,279 --> 00:02:11,559
I sold my house.

15
00:02:13,159 --> 00:02:14,480
I've been here

16
00:02:16,439 --> 00:02:17,839
for 53 days.

17
00:02:26,559 --> 00:02:27,640
Who's yours?

18
00:02:31,399 --> 00:02:31,999
My mom.

19
00:02:33,190 --> 00:02:34,399
She was brought in yesterday.

20
00:02:35,719 --> 00:02:36,320
Your mom?

21
00:02:38,879 --> 00:02:39,439
There, there.

22
00:02:39,999 --> 00:02:40,999
She'll be alright.

23
00:02:41,920 --> 00:02:42,559
Don't worry.

24
00:02:43,999 --> 00:02:44,679
Oh, no.

25
00:02:44,679 --> 00:02:46,439
You can't do it like this.

26
00:02:47,879 --> 00:02:49,320
Follow what they do.

27
00:02:49,480 --> 00:02:50,760
Get a camp bed.

28
00:02:51,159 --> 00:02:53,119
You can rest day and night.

29
00:02:54,200 --> 00:02:54,879
Miss,

30
00:02:55,279 --> 00:02:56,159
I suggest you

31
00:02:56,159 --> 00:02:57,480
buy an eye mask.

32
00:02:57,480 --> 00:02:59,200
The lights here are too bright at night.

33
00:02:59,200 --> 00:03:00,599
Just bring a small blanket,

34
00:03:00,760 --> 00:03:02,750
or you won't know
where to put it during the day.

35
00:03:03,080 --> 00:03:03,920
Miss,

36
00:03:04,159 --> 00:03:05,760
bring a bigger thermos.

37
00:03:06,080 --> 00:03:08,119
The water dispenser is far.

38
00:03:08,439 --> 00:03:09,200
Really inconvenient.

39
00:03:11,279 --> 00:03:12,520
There are all our experiences.

40
00:03:13,080 --> 00:03:14,070
Give it to me, Mingzhu.

41
00:03:15,010 --> 00:03:16,040
This is my sister-in-law.

42
00:03:17,490 --> 00:03:18,200
- Hello.
- Hello.

43
00:03:18,439 --> 00:03:19,599
You're pregnant.

44
00:03:20,800 --> 00:03:21,999
That's not easy.

45
00:03:22,999 --> 00:03:24,399
You should sit.

46
00:03:24,399 --> 00:03:24,760
Sit.

47
00:03:24,760 --> 00:03:25,439
Thank you.

48
00:03:25,439 --> 00:03:26,480
Don't mention it.

49
00:03:26,480 --> 00:03:27,360
Thank you, mister.

50
00:03:27,360 --> 00:03:28,279
You're welcome.

51
00:03:32,879 --> 00:03:35,119
Being pregnant is tough.

52
00:03:36,159 --> 00:03:37,240
Everyone is tough.

53
00:03:37,800 --> 00:03:38,360
Mingzhu,

54
00:03:38,520 --> 00:03:39,760
how much money do we have left?

55
00:03:40,200 --> 00:03:41,999
Only 24,200 altogether.

56
00:03:42,679 --> 00:03:44,279
I brought all of Dad's condolence money.

57
00:03:45,719 --> 00:03:46,559
Is that all we have?

58
00:03:47,640 --> 00:03:49,080
These are from friends.

59
00:03:49,490 --> 00:03:50,800
At least those business partners

60
00:03:50,800 --> 00:03:52,240
aren't here to collect debts.

61
00:03:55,960 --> 00:03:56,920
They're realistic.

62
00:04:08,200 --> 00:04:09,040
Everyone is.

63
00:04:10,599 --> 00:04:11,599
You and I too.

64
00:04:15,879 --> 00:04:16,440
Shen.

65
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:17,799
Come here.

66
00:04:25,200 --> 00:04:25,839
What's wrong?

67
00:04:25,839 --> 00:04:27,239
Look how much we should transfer.

68
00:04:27,479 --> 00:04:28,320
Here.

69
00:04:28,479 --> 00:04:29,640
Why me?

70
00:04:29,640 --> 00:04:30,440
You decide.

71
00:04:30,919 --> 00:04:33,080
Aren't you the head of the family?

72
00:04:33,799 --> 00:04:36,279
Since when am I the head of the family?

73
00:04:40,120 --> 00:04:41,080
That's it?

74
00:04:42,080 --> 00:04:42,950
That's all the money?

75
00:04:43,680 --> 00:04:44,359
What do you mean?

76
00:04:44,359 --> 00:04:45,560
You think I...

77
00:04:45,680 --> 00:04:47,680
I mean, even if that's all the money,

78
00:04:48,120 --> 00:04:49,719
they're everything my wife

79
00:04:49,719 --> 00:04:50,650
worked so hard to save.

80
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:55,680
I worked so hard for this,

81
00:04:57,080 --> 00:04:59,120
yet I'm giving it
to Mingzhu's mother-in-law,

82
00:04:59,120 --> 00:05:00,440
who looks down on us.

83
00:05:00,440 --> 00:05:02,039
Just thinking about it makes me angry.

84
00:05:02,880 --> 00:05:03,919
Look at you.

85
00:05:03,919 --> 00:05:05,359
You send them money

86
00:05:05,440 --> 00:05:06,640
and complain at the same time.

87
00:05:07,839 --> 00:05:09,200
Isn't that silly?

88
00:05:10,640 --> 00:05:11,680
Yes, I am.

89
00:05:12,760 --> 00:05:14,060
How much should we transfer then?

90
00:05:15,120 --> 00:05:16,560
You decide.

91
00:05:18,760 --> 00:05:19,640
It's to save a life.

92
00:05:20,520 --> 00:05:21,279
Just transfer

93
00:05:21,279 --> 00:05:22,239
everything we have.

94
00:05:22,239 --> 00:05:23,039
All of it?

95
00:05:23,640 --> 00:05:24,760
If not all, then what?

96
00:05:27,919 --> 00:05:29,279
You're really silly.

97
00:05:30,919 --> 00:05:31,880
My silly wife.

98
00:05:31,880 --> 00:05:32,880
Xiu'e

99
00:05:33,320 --> 00:05:34,560
is a silly dear.

100
00:05:41,500 --> 00:05:42,740
(Shen Mingzhu, Yue Xiu'e has transferred
120,450 yuan to your account.)

101
00:05:55,320 --> 00:05:56,159
Hello, Mom?

102
00:05:56,479 --> 00:05:58,120
Why did you send me so much money?

103
00:05:58,719 --> 00:05:59,440
It's not much.

104
00:05:59,839 --> 00:06:01,719
ICU is a money pit.

105
00:06:02,760 --> 00:06:04,399
Let it cover a few days.

106
00:06:04,399 --> 00:06:06,080
Even though
I don't like your mother-in-law,

107
00:06:06,080 --> 00:06:07,599
we can't just sit on our hands.

108
00:06:08,359 --> 00:06:10,120
Why didn't your father-in-law

109
00:06:10,120 --> 00:06:11,479
buy insurance?

110
00:06:11,960 --> 00:06:13,799
But that's your retirement money.

111
00:06:14,039 --> 00:06:15,680
Nonsense. What retirement?

112
00:06:15,680 --> 00:06:16,680
I'm still young.

113
00:06:16,680 --> 00:06:17,960
We're far from retiring.

114
00:06:17,960 --> 00:06:18,919
I'm young too.

115
00:06:20,320 --> 00:06:22,200
We're still strong enough to work.

116
00:06:22,279 --> 00:06:23,120
We can still work.

117
00:06:23,120 --> 00:06:23,919
Don't worry.

118
00:06:26,239 --> 00:06:28,239
Do you still have money for yourselves?

119
00:06:28,320 --> 00:06:28,919
Yes.

120
00:06:29,239 --> 00:06:29,880
Yes.

121
00:06:30,159 --> 00:06:33,320
Your mom has three bank cards.

122
00:06:33,320 --> 00:06:35,279
Right. We're fine.

123
00:06:35,279 --> 00:06:36,080
We have money.

124
00:06:36,159 --> 00:06:37,359
Mingzhu,

125
00:06:37,880 --> 00:06:38,880
listen.

126
00:06:40,159 --> 00:06:42,530
Your dad and I
can't leave the restaurant right now,

127
00:06:42,540 --> 00:06:44,239
so we won't come help you
at the hospital.

128
00:06:44,239 --> 00:06:46,320
Just be careful.

129
00:06:46,320 --> 00:06:47,359
Don't strain yourself.

130
00:06:47,359 --> 00:06:48,320
Careful of what?

131
00:06:48,320 --> 00:06:49,599
Stay calm.

132
00:06:49,599 --> 00:06:50,880
Don't rush it.

133
00:06:50,880 --> 00:06:52,640
You're carrying a baby now.

134
00:06:52,640 --> 00:06:53,799
Alright?

135
00:06:54,120 --> 00:06:55,799
You know what I mean, right?

136
00:06:56,039 --> 00:06:56,599
Okay.

137
00:06:57,760 --> 00:07:00,680
Number 29, please proceed to window 5
for payment.

138
00:07:00,960 --> 00:07:01,839
Mom, it's my turn.

139
00:07:01,839 --> 00:07:02,799
I'm hanging up.

140
00:07:02,799 --> 00:07:03,760
Go on.

141
00:07:11,440 --> 00:07:12,039
Meiqi.

142
00:07:12,680 --> 00:07:13,279
Mingzhu.

143
00:07:13,520 --> 00:07:14,680
How much did you pay today?

144
00:07:14,760 --> 00:07:15,399
Look.

145
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:16,640
What's it?

146
00:07:17,080 --> 00:07:18,399
Thanks to my mom reminding me,

147
00:07:18,460 --> 00:07:19,320
I suddenly remembered

148
00:07:19,320 --> 00:07:21,359
I bought my dad a life insurance policy.

149
00:07:23,479 --> 00:07:25,120
Why did you buy life insurance for Dad?

150
00:07:25,120 --> 00:07:27,279
He told me to buy an education fund
for the baby.

151
00:07:27,359 --> 00:07:28,479
I asked the agent,

152
00:07:28,479 --> 00:07:30,279
and they said
based on our family situation,

153
00:07:30,279 --> 00:07:31,760
I should insure Dad.

154
00:07:33,719 --> 00:07:34,760
Thank you, Mingzhu.

155
00:07:35,880 --> 00:07:36,560
But

156
00:07:37,719 --> 00:07:39,719
I put "legal heir" as the beneficiary.

157
00:07:40,039 --> 00:07:41,000
By right,

158
00:07:41,719 --> 00:07:43,320
that kid gets a share too.

159
00:07:45,239 --> 00:07:47,520
We're not even sure
if that's my dad's child.

160
00:07:54,279 --> 00:07:55,960
Don't take this the wrong way,

161
00:07:56,440 --> 00:07:57,320
but that kid

162
00:07:58,399 --> 00:08:00,039
looks exactly like your dad.

163
00:08:03,919 --> 00:08:04,760
What do we do?

164
00:08:04,950 --> 00:08:06,440
My mom almost died because of them,

165
00:08:06,440 --> 00:08:08,260
and now I have to
split the money with them?

166
00:08:11,399 --> 00:08:12,000
Look,

167
00:08:12,560 --> 00:08:13,680
take the insurance policy

168
00:08:13,680 --> 00:08:14,799
to the company

169
00:08:15,320 --> 00:08:17,039
and see if you can claim it.

170
00:08:17,520 --> 00:08:18,640
Saving Mom is more important.

171
00:08:23,279 --> 00:08:24,479
I'll send you the policy.

172
00:08:24,880 --> 00:08:25,520
Alright.

173
00:08:31,279 --> 00:08:32,800
Excuse me. I'd like to ask about

174
00:08:32,800 --> 00:08:35,040
how to file a claim
on the life insurance

175
00:08:35,040 --> 00:08:36,519
my dad bought before his death.

176
00:08:36,519 --> 00:08:37,839
Do you have a death certificate?

177
00:08:38,119 --> 00:08:38,759
Yes.

178
00:08:39,960 --> 00:08:41,280
The household register's here too.

179
00:08:53,759 --> 00:08:55,400
Are you the only child?

180
00:08:55,800 --> 00:08:56,759
I have an older brother.

181
00:08:57,719 --> 00:08:58,599
He passed away.

182
00:09:02,960 --> 00:09:04,639
Your mom isn't here?

183
00:09:06,280 --> 00:09:08,200
She had a brain hemorrhage.
She's in the ICU.

184
00:09:08,800 --> 00:09:10,519
We need this money for her treatment.

185
00:09:11,519 --> 00:09:12,280
Okay.

186
00:09:12,280 --> 00:09:12,999
Here's the thing.

187
00:09:12,999 --> 00:09:14,839
According to the policy,

188
00:09:14,839 --> 00:09:16,719
you need to provide notarization.

189
00:09:17,280 --> 00:09:17,960
Notarization?

190
00:09:18,200 --> 00:09:19,639
Yes, you have to prove

191
00:09:19,639 --> 00:09:21,080
you're the sole legal heir.

192
00:09:21,400 --> 00:09:22,040
Because

193
00:09:22,040 --> 00:09:24,160
we've had cases before

194
00:09:24,400 --> 00:09:26,080
where children claimed the payout,

195
00:09:26,080 --> 00:09:28,839
and later the parent's extramarital kid

196
00:09:29,160 --> 00:09:30,290
showed up and caused trouble.

197
00:09:33,239 --> 00:09:34,200
Okay, I see.

198
00:09:35,999 --> 00:09:36,999
Notarization?

199
00:09:37,639 --> 00:09:38,280
Yes.

200
00:09:39,639 --> 00:09:41,119
That child has a birth certificate,

201
00:09:41,560 --> 00:09:43,190
so he'll have
household registration too.

202
00:09:43,200 --> 00:09:43,960
Once I notarize it,

203
00:09:43,960 --> 00:09:46,130
the mom will definitely show up
to fight for the inheritance.

204
00:09:46,720 --> 00:09:47,920
But without the notarization,

205
00:09:48,280 --> 00:09:49,519
we can't get the money.

206
00:09:50,519 --> 00:09:52,400
We've owed so much
for the medical bills.

- Here.

209
00:10:00,280 --> 00:10:01,639
Here's the situation.

210
00:10:01,639 --> 00:10:02,960
The patient's heart has stopped.

211
00:10:03,260 --> 00:10:04,530
We're working on her right now.

212
00:10:05,239 --> 00:10:06,879
You need your consent.

213
00:10:07,080 --> 00:10:08,280
If necessary,

214
00:10:08,519 --> 00:10:10,519
do you agree to use an ECMO?

215
00:10:10,639 --> 00:10:11,400
- Yes.
- Yes.

00:10:14,759 --> 00:10:15,519
Please sign here.

217
00:10:20,119 --> 00:10:21,200
How much does it cost?

218
00:10:21,400 --> 00:10:22,719
Around thirty to fifty thousand.

219
00:10:23,400 --> 00:10:24,080
A day.

220
00:10:29,719 --> 00:10:30,400
Use an ECMO.

221
00:10:31,400 --> 00:10:33,160

we'll sell the apartment.

295
00:14:56,200 --> 00:14:57,879

Jade bracelet.

297
00:15:03,440 --> 00:15:04,160
One.

298
00:15:05,440 --> 00:15:06,519
What are you saying, Mom?

299
00:15:06,680 --> 00:15:09,359
Your mom keeps muttering
about "jade bracelet"

300
00:15:09,359 --> 00:15:10,280
and "one".

301
00:15:10,680 --> 00:15:12,200
I'm not sure what she means.

302
00:15:15,200 --> 00:15:15,920
One.

303
00:15:19,160 --> 00:15:20,119
One.

Mingzhu,

306
00:15:40,320 --> 00:15:42,479
if there's only one jade bracelet,

307
00:15:43,580 --> 00:15:45,280
which one is supposed
to be the real one?

308
00:15:52,040 --> 00:15:53,480
Bed 8, your fees are overdue again.

309
00:15:53,920 --> 00:15:54,519
Okay.

310
00:15:59,280 --> 00:16:00,359
I'll go home this afternoon

311
00:16:00,839 --> 00:16:01,759

Why didn't you tell me
something this big?

315
00:16:17,460 --> 00:16:19,040
This is from my dad, my mom, my brother,

316
00:16:19,040 --> 00:16:19,719
and me.

317
00:16:19,719 --> 00:16:20,999
Fifty thousand.

318
00:16:20,999 --> 00:16:21,920
Take it.

319
00:16:22,119 --> 00:16:23,320
No, I can't take your money.

320
00:16:23,320 --> 00:16:24,839
Take it. Saving life comes first.

321
00:16:29,720 --> 00:16:30,999
I'll consider it a loan from you.

322
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:32,450
I'll pay you back once I have money.

323
00:16:35,999 --> 00:16:36,560
Meiqi,

324
00:16:36,680 --> 00:16:38,200
go pay the outstanding fees.

325
00:16:40,719 --> 00:16:41,639
Thank you, Zhixia.

326
00:16:41,639 --> 00:16:43,350
We're family. Don't say that.
Hurry and go.

327
00:16:47,400 --> 00:16:48,320
Thank you.

328
00:16:50,460 --> 00:16:52,040
If there's nothing else, I'll get going.

329
00:16:52,320 --> 00:16:53,239
I'm really busy.

330
00:16:54,239 --> 00:16:54,960
Zhixia,

331
00:16:55,239 --> 00:16:56,759
there's something I want to ask.

332
00:16:57,080 --> 00:16:57,719
What's it?

333
00:16:57,719 --> 00:16:58,960
About the bracelet.

334
00:16:59,160 --> 00:17:00,850
After you fixed it
and gave it back to me,

335
00:17:01,239 --> 00:17:03,280
I can't see any traces of repair.

336
00:17:06,559 --> 00:17:07,559
What happened?

337
00:17:08,799 --> 00:17:11,079
Is it the same bracelet that broke?

338
00:17:12,559 --> 00:17:13,680
Tell me.

339
00:17:16,519 --> 00:17:17,239
No.

340
00:17:18,660 --> 00:17:21,090
My mom was worried you'd be in
a tough spot with your in-laws,

341
00:17:21,100 --> 00:17:22,440
so she went to Banqiao Jade Market

342
00:17:22,440 --> 00:17:23,719
and bought you an identical one.

343
00:17:25,319 --> 00:17:27,079
How much is that?

344
00:17:27,160 --> 00:17:28,079
That's too expensive.

345
00:17:28,079 --> 00:17:29,279
It's not about money.

346
00:17:30,319 --> 00:17:31,640
Ms. Yu did it from the heart.

347
00:17:31,960 --> 00:17:33,350
That's not something money can buy.

348
00:17:33,719 --> 00:17:34,239
But...

349
00:17:34,239 --> 00:17:34,960
Look.

350
00:17:34,960 --> 00:17:37,320
The last time she was hospitalized,
you went to visit her.

351
00:17:37,400 --> 00:17:38,960
She saw you wearing the bracelet,

352
00:17:39,340 --> 00:17:40,640
and she brightened up right away.

353
00:17:42,200 --> 00:17:42,840
No, I can't.

354
00:17:43,260 --> 00:17:44,039
What are you doing?

355
00:17:44,039 --> 00:17:45,079
Zhixia, listen.

356
00:17:45,079 --> 00:17:46,319
I appreciate what your mom did.

357
00:17:46,319 --> 00:17:47,239
Thank her for me.

358
00:17:47,239 --> 00:17:48,840
But I really can't take this bracelet.

359
00:17:48,840 --> 00:17:50,479
I'll fix the bracelet myself.

360
00:17:50,479 --> 00:17:51,079
It'll still work.

361
00:17:51,079 --> 00:17:52,440
- What?
- Your bracelet is fake.

362
00:17:52,440 --> 00:17:53,880
What's there to fix?

363
00:17:56,160 --> 00:17:57,400
Let me tell you the truth.

364
00:17:58,960 --> 00:18:00,559
Your bracelet is fake.

365
00:18:01,400 --> 00:18:02,440

366
00:18:02,440 --> 00:18:03,920
bought you an identical one.

367
00:18:05,559 --> 00:18:06,840
She didn't want credit for it.

368
00:18:07,600 --> 00:18:08,400
She just wanted you

369
00:18:08,759 --> 00:18:10,880
to wear it on your wrist.

370
00:18:12,079 --> 00:18:13,039
If now you want me

371
00:18:13,039 --> 00:18:14,440
to give it back to her,

372
00:18:15,210 --> 00:18:16,559
do you know how anxious she'd be?

373
00:18:16,999 --> 00:18:18,680
She's already worried sick.

374
00:18:20,279 --> 00:18:20,999
Just take it.

00:18:38,080 --> 00:18:40,540
I went to drop off a gift this morning.
I grabbed them on the way.

378
00:18:40,559 --> 00:18:41,910
Couldn't you take something nicer?

379
00:18:42,920 --> 00:18:44,079
Be grateful.

380
00:18:49,079 --> 00:18:50,079
You're back again.

381
00:18:55,079 --> 00:18:55,840
Man.

382
00:18:58,039 --> 00:19:00,479
Three red packets are too much.

383
00:19:01,239 --> 00:19:02,039
No, no, Xu.

384
00:19:02,039 --> 00:19:03,239
No.

385
00:19:03,240 --> 00:19:04,239
That's separate
from selling the motorbike.

386
00:19:04,239 --> 00:19:05,519
You don't have to give me that.

387
00:19:05,519 --> 00:19:06,799
Have some wedding candy.

388
00:19:07,440 --> 00:19:08,559
Candy? I can't.

389
00:19:08,680 --> 00:19:09,440
I don't smoke.

390
00:19:09,460 --> 00:19:10,559
Let's go and do the paperwork.

391
00:19:10,559 --> 00:19:12,079
- Alright.
- Let's go.

392
00:19:12,200 --> 00:19:12,799
Let's go.

393
00:19:13,200 --> 00:19:14,079
Come.

394
00:19:14,640 --> 00:19:15,680
Want some wedding candy?

395
00:19:15,920 --> 00:19:16,479
No.

396
00:19:16,479 --> 00:19:17,960
I'm too old for sweets.

397
00:19:18,200 --> 00:19:19,680
I honestly didn't shortchange you.

398
00:19:19,840 --> 00:19:21,840
This is the most I can offer.

399
00:19:21,840 --> 00:19:22,319
Alright.

400
00:19:22,319 --> 00:19:23,319
If you had decided earlier last time,

401
00:19:23,319 --> 00:19:24,479
you would've gotten the money sooner.

402
00:19:24,479 --> 00:19:25,200
- Fine.
- Right?

403
00:19:26,319 --> 00:19:27,759
Please sign here, the owner.

404
00:19:35,559 --> 00:19:36,239
Xu,

405
00:19:36,559 --> 00:19:37,680
your car has a fine.

406
00:19:38,440 --> 00:19:39,160
No.

407
00:19:39,319 --> 00:19:40,519
It's written right there.

408
00:19:41,319 --> 00:19:43,160
It's yours. Illegal operation.

409
00:19:43,319 --> 00:19:44,239
Wait, miss.

410
00:19:44,960 --> 00:19:46,039
I have relatives.

411
00:19:46,140 --> 00:19:47,760
I know someone
in the traffic department.

412
00:19:47,999 --> 00:19:49,160
He settled it.

413
00:19:49,519 --> 00:19:50,279
Impossible.

414
00:19:50,400 --> 00:19:51,759
Xu,

415
00:19:52,279 --> 00:19:52,999
all you need to do

416
00:19:52,999 --> 00:19:54,600
is pay the fine.

417
00:19:54,600 --> 00:19:55,479
That's the only way to settle it.

418
00:19:55,479 --> 00:19:57,400
Pulling strings doesn't work anymore
these days.

419
00:20:01,680 --> 00:20:03,160
You settled it?

420
00:20:03,519 --> 00:20:04,519
It's no big deal.

421
00:20:15,999 --> 00:20:17,440
How much is the fine, Miss?

422
00:20:17,840 --> 00:20:18,519
Three thousand.

423
00:20:31,719 --> 00:20:33,319
You didn't go to piano class today?

424
00:20:33,479 --> 00:20:35,200
Mom switched it to online.

425
00:20:35,200 --> 00:20:36,079
It's on Friday.

426
00:20:37,559 --> 00:20:38,319
Why?

427
00:20:48,880 --> 00:20:50,190
Why did you switch it to online?

428
00:20:50,640 --> 00:20:51,559
It's cheaper.

429
00:20:53,239 --> 00:20:54,960
But we already paid.

430
00:20:55,160 --> 00:20:56,319
I paid half.

431
00:20:59,319 --> 00:21:00,079
We didn't.

432
00:21:03,039 --> 00:21:04,039
Where did the money go?

433
00:21:06,519 --> 00:21:07,680
I lent it to my sister.

434
00:21:28,519 --> 00:21:29,160
Hao,

435
00:21:29,640 --> 00:21:30,479
drink some milk.

436
00:21:40,319 --> 00:21:41,079
Hao,

437
00:21:41,840 --> 00:21:42,920
have some fruit.

438
00:21:51,840 --> 00:21:53,680
Hao,

439
00:21:53,759 --> 00:21:56,120
don't be mad.

440
00:22:02,600 --> 00:22:05,479
I really thought about it carefully.

441
00:22:06,200 --> 00:22:08,680
Online classes are fine too.

442
00:22:08,880 --> 00:22:11,079
The teachers are responsible.

443
00:22:11,079 --> 00:22:13,440
Who said you should
keep your standards high?

444
00:22:14,360 --> 00:22:16,440
Who said if you're going to learn,
you should learn from the best?

445
00:22:19,479 --> 00:22:20,120
Zhixia,

446
00:22:20,960 --> 00:22:21,600
I think

447
00:22:21,600 --> 00:22:24,039
we should look after
our own family first

448
00:22:24,319 --> 00:22:26,200
before helping your big family.

449
00:22:28,279 --> 00:22:30,079
Piano lessons and someone's life,

450
00:22:30,680 --> 00:22:32,120
which one matters more?

451
00:22:32,120 --> 00:22:33,640
You can't compare them.

452
00:22:34,239 --> 00:22:36,239
That's your sister's mother-in-law.

453
00:22:36,239 --> 00:22:36,920
She's not directly related.

454
00:22:36,920 --> 00:22:38,719
Like you said, that's my sister.

455
00:22:38,719 --> 00:22:39,920
She's married into another family.

456
00:22:39,920 --> 00:22:40,880
So what?

457
00:22:40,880 --> 00:22:42,680
She's still my sister.

458
00:22:42,759 --> 00:22:45,079
We're blood related, you know?

459
00:22:46,999 --> 00:22:48,079
So by that logic,

460
00:22:48,479 --> 00:22:49,400
"A married-off daughter

461
00:22:49,400 --> 00:22:50,840
is spilled water"?

462
00:22:51,400 --> 00:22:52,759
If Jiao gets married someday,

463
00:22:52,860 --> 00:22:54,319
will she not be our daughter anymore?

464
00:23:02,640 --> 00:23:04,360
Don't be mad.

465
00:23:05,519 --> 00:23:07,160
Hao.

466
00:23:10,960 --> 00:23:12,479
How are things going

467
00:23:12,479 --> 00:23:15,279
with the promotion assessment?

468
00:23:16,319 --> 00:23:16,960
I know

469
00:23:16,960 --> 00:23:18,759
it's a terrible time

470
00:23:18,759 --> 00:23:19,799
to bring it up.

471
00:23:20,479 --> 00:23:23,559
But I've been so stressed lately.

472
00:23:23,719 --> 00:23:24,799
I want something

473
00:23:24,799 --> 00:23:26,600
to cheer me up.

474
00:23:28,279 --> 00:23:31,400
If my promotion could cheer you up,

475
00:23:31,680 --> 00:23:33,559
chances are it won't.

476
00:23:33,920 --> 00:23:34,559
Why?

477
00:23:34,559 --> 00:23:35,940
Because I think the one getting it

478
00:23:35,960 --> 00:23:37,239
is probably Wu.

479
00:23:37,610 --> 00:23:38,680
He's got stronger backing,

480
00:23:38,680 --> 00:23:39,559
more connections,

481
00:23:39,559 --> 00:23:40,960
and he's more sociable.

482
00:23:40,960 --> 00:23:41,600
Zhang Hao.

483
00:23:42,640 --> 00:23:44,239
You can't

484
00:23:44,239 --> 00:23:45,680
sell yourself short.

485
00:23:46,120 --> 00:23:47,719
Why are you being such a coward?

486
00:23:47,719 --> 00:23:48,319
Dad,

487
00:23:48,920 --> 00:23:50,719
are we still getting donuts?

488
00:23:51,360 --> 00:23:52,479
I forgot.

489
00:23:53,719 --> 00:23:56,319
Hurry and go. It's almost eight.

490
00:24:02,440 --> 00:24:04,840
We'll go to the supermarket

491
00:24:05,360 --> 00:24:06,920
to see if eggs are on sale.

492
00:24:11,039 --> 00:24:11,759
I must say,

493
00:24:12,440 --> 00:24:13,759
I'm starting

494
00:24:15,840 --> 00:24:18,039
to see Yu Jingxiang differently.

495
00:24:18,479 --> 00:24:19,920
She spent so much

496
00:24:19,920 --> 00:24:21,759
to buy Mingzhu a real jade bracelet,

497
00:24:22,440 --> 00:24:24,319
took the fake one herself,

498
00:24:24,519 --> 00:24:25,960
and never even mentioned it.

499
00:24:27,340 --> 00:24:29,239
If Mingzhu's mother-in-law
hadn't fallen ill,

500
00:24:30,239 --> 00:24:31,759
no one would've known.

501
00:24:32,559 --> 00:24:34,360
I actually think she and her husband

502
00:24:34,360 --> 00:24:37,319
are genuinely good to Mingzhu.

503
00:24:37,799 --> 00:24:38,400
No.

504
00:24:39,360 --> 00:24:40,640
Something's off.

505
00:24:41,319 --> 00:24:42,400
I need to think about it.

506
00:24:43,160 --> 00:24:44,759
That woman is suspicious

507
00:24:45,200 --> 00:24:46,239
and calculating.

508
00:24:48,360 --> 00:24:49,799
She might be a spy.

509
00:24:51,239 --> 00:24:51,840
Mom,

510
00:24:52,200 --> 00:24:53,840
it's peacetime.

511
00:24:56,160 --> 00:24:56,799
No.

512
00:24:57,279 --> 00:24:58,279
Go upstairs

513
00:24:58,279 --> 00:24:59,719
and bring that bracelet down.

514
00:24:59,719 --> 00:25:01,719
We'll sell it and return
the money to her.

515
00:25:02,360 --> 00:25:03,440
I don't want any messy ties.

516
00:25:03,460 --> 00:25:04,920
We'll walk our path, she walks hers.

517
00:25:04,920 --> 00:25:05,559
We don't owe her anything.

518
00:25:05,559 --> 00:25:06,160
No way.

519
00:25:07,490 --> 00:25:08,960
Dad and I worked so hard
selling pork chops

520
00:25:08,960 --> 00:25:10,680
to buy that bracelet

521
00:25:11,039 --> 00:25:12,239
for you.

522
00:25:12,660 --> 00:25:14,479
I don't care about
other people's heirlooms,

523
00:25:14,880 --> 00:25:16,759
but ours is not for sale.

524
00:25:17,039 --> 00:25:18,559
Minghui gave it to you

525
00:25:18,840 --> 00:25:20,680
with all his heart.

526
00:25:20,799 --> 00:25:21,999
And you're going to sell it.

527
00:25:22,140 --> 00:25:23,060
Right?

528
00:25:23,560 --> 00:25:24,960
Besides, unless you wait
eight or ten years,

529
00:25:24,960 --> 00:25:26,400
you won't get a good price

530
00:25:26,400 --> 00:25:27,799
for selling the bracelet.

531
00:25:28,279 --> 00:25:29,120
We really

532
00:25:29,120 --> 00:25:30,680
have no money now.

533
00:25:31,400 --> 00:25:32,519
If I don't sell it,

534
00:25:32,519 --> 00:25:34,719
we'll owe that Yu woman a favor.

535
00:25:34,719 --> 00:25:36,360
How will we face her later?

536
00:25:39,719 --> 00:25:40,279
I'm done.

537
00:25:42,160 --> 00:25:43,360
She's just saying.

538
00:25:43,360 --> 00:25:44,440
She won't sell it.

539
00:25:49,039 --> 00:25:50,400
Minghui is upset.

540
00:25:50,610 --> 00:25:51,559
What are we going to do?

541
00:25:51,559 --> 00:25:52,279
We have no money.

542
00:25:52,279 --> 00:25:53,600
Not even a dime.

543
00:25:53,600 --> 00:25:55,039
If we don't give her back the money,

544
00:25:55,039 --> 00:25:55,999
- she'll...
- Why bring this up

545
00:25:55,999 --> 00:25:57,479
while we're eating?

546
00:25:59,239 --> 00:25:59,799
What?

547
00:25:59,799 --> 00:26:00,759
You think you can sell it right away?

548
00:26:00,759 --> 00:26:01,750
Who would you sell it to?

549
00:26:02,559 --> 00:26:03,719
You always act on impulse.

550
00:26:03,719 --> 00:26:04,920
What's wrong with you?

551
00:26:23,039 --> 00:26:24,880
Minghui, I peeled an apple for you.

552
00:26:28,120 --> 00:26:30,759
It's so good. Crisp and sweet.

553
00:26:31,160 --> 00:26:32,239
Come on. Have a bite.

554
00:26:32,239 --> 00:26:33,079
I don't want it.

555
00:26:34,840 --> 00:26:36,700
Just take one.

556
00:26:38,519 --> 00:26:40,400
It's crisp and sweet. Really.

557
00:26:40,640 --> 00:26:42,400
Here. Just one. Be good.

558
00:26:42,400 --> 00:26:42,999
Here you go.

559
00:26:43,360 --> 00:26:44,079
I'm not eating it.

560
00:26:47,999 --> 00:26:49,039
I'm sorry.

561
00:26:51,519 --> 00:26:52,039
I promise

562
00:26:52,039 --> 00:26:54,120
I'll never sell the bracelet, okay?

563
00:26:54,120 --> 00:26:55,680
I'll save it for your future wife, okay?

564
00:26:59,880 --> 00:27:00,600
Swear it.

565
00:27:02,200 --> 00:27:03,039
I swear.

566
00:27:04,039 --> 00:27:05,519
If I, Yue Xiu'e, sell the bracelet

567
00:27:05,519 --> 00:27:06,759
in this lifetime,

568
00:27:06,759 --> 00:27:07,440
then I will...

569
00:27:07,440 --> 00:27:08,479
Alright. Enough, Mom.

570
00:27:09,640 --> 00:27:11,039
I know you're a sweet boy.

571
00:27:11,559 --> 00:27:12,319
Number one.

572
00:27:13,360 --> 00:27:14,600
Here. It's nice.

573
00:27:14,600 --> 00:27:15,400
Just one piece.

574
00:27:15,640 --> 00:27:16,360
Try it.

575
00:27:17,279 --> 00:27:17,999
Good, right?

576
00:27:18,360 --> 00:27:18,920
It's sweet.

577
00:27:21,039 --> 00:27:22,050
I'm not giving it to you.

578
00:27:22,880 --> 00:27:24,079
You little brat.

579
00:27:25,440 --> 00:27:26,039
Shen.

580
00:27:31,440 --> 00:27:33,039
Why did you come here at this hour?

581
00:27:34,120 --> 00:27:35,319
Shen, I just found out

582
00:27:36,400 --> 00:27:37,239
you paid that fine

583
00:27:37,840 --> 00:27:39,600
for me.

584
00:27:40,680 --> 00:27:42,039
You mean that sidecar?

585
00:27:42,039 --> 00:27:43,519
Well, that?

586
00:27:43,519 --> 00:27:44,600
That's nothing. Forget it.

587
00:27:44,600 --> 00:27:45,279
Wait.

588
00:27:47,200 --> 00:27:48,039
Thirty thousand.

589
00:27:49,039 --> 00:27:49,799
Take it.

590
00:27:50,039 --> 00:27:51,120
I sold my motorbike.

591
00:27:51,519 --> 00:27:52,120
What?

592
00:27:53,960 --> 00:27:55,440
You treasure the bike
as if it were your life.

593
00:27:55,440 --> 00:27:56,999
Why did you sell it?

594
00:27:56,999 --> 00:27:57,960
Don't think too much.

595
00:27:58,360 --> 00:27:59,479
This money isn't for you.

596
00:27:59,880 --> 00:28:00,960
It's for the girl.

597
00:28:02,479 --> 00:28:05,039
We all know what happened in her family.

598
00:28:05,400 --> 00:28:07,279
My wife can't even sleep.

599
00:28:07,519 --> 00:28:08,559
Tell her this.

600
00:28:09,479 --> 00:28:10,840
Life has always

601
00:28:11,160 --> 00:28:13,960
thrown problems at you.

602
00:28:13,999 --> 00:28:15,559
She doesn't need to carry it alone.

603
00:28:15,559 --> 00:28:18,079
She has two sets of parents now.

604
00:28:18,079 --> 00:28:19,400
Yes, if you want to show concern,

605
00:28:19,400 --> 00:28:20,840
show it yourself.

606
00:28:20,840 --> 00:28:21,519
Shen,

607
00:28:21,960 --> 00:28:22,759
you know

608
00:28:23,999 --> 00:28:25,840
she's closer to you.

609
00:28:28,360 --> 00:28:29,079
Please.

610
00:28:34,360 --> 00:28:35,160
I'm off.

611
00:28:46,200 --> 00:28:46,840
Jiao.

612
00:28:48,479 --> 00:28:51,759
Don't let Grandma know your piano lesson
has switched to online.

613
00:28:52,680 --> 00:28:53,559
Why not?

614
00:28:54,519 --> 00:28:58,640
Because Grandma is one of the investors
in your piano lessons.

615
00:29:00,759 --> 00:29:01,479
Dad,

616
00:29:02,120 --> 00:29:03,600
does this count as lying?

617
00:29:05,999 --> 00:29:07,840
Am I lying

618
00:29:08,140 --> 00:29:09,600
because you didn't get promoted?

619
00:29:11,319 --> 00:29:12,960
If you never become a director,

620
00:29:13,680 --> 00:29:15,279
does that mean I'll have to keep lying?

621
00:29:17,759 --> 00:29:18,519
Well...

622
00:29:18,680 --> 00:29:19,719
We're here.

623
00:29:35,073 --> 00:29:35,759
Jiao.

624
00:29:36,999 --> 00:29:38,840
Why didn't you buy your favorite donut?

625
00:29:39,200 --> 00:29:41,120
They're cheap. Buy one, get one free.

626
00:29:44,039 --> 00:29:45,160
Jiao, put them back.

627
00:29:45,380 --> 00:29:46,960
We're not buying discounted stuff today.

628
00:29:48,039 --> 00:29:49,319
We're buying your favorite.

629
00:29:56,400 --> 00:29:57,479
Dad, you're the best.

630
00:30:13,759 --> 00:30:14,360
Dear.

631
00:30:17,759 --> 00:30:18,479
Jianqi.

632
00:30:20,600 --> 00:30:22,440
I missed you so much, Jianqi.

633
00:30:26,053 --> 00:30:26,960
Me too.

634
00:30:34,079 --> 00:30:34,799
Jianqi,

635
00:30:35,759 --> 00:30:36,920
take me with you.

636
00:30:37,640 --> 00:30:39,479
I can't hold on anymore.

637
00:30:44,239 --> 00:30:44,880
Mingzhu,

638
00:30:46,200 --> 00:30:47,719
I can't be selfish.

639
00:30:50,600 --> 00:30:51,880
In your life,

640
00:30:53,559 --> 00:30:55,039
you're playing many other roles.

641
00:30:57,120 --> 00:30:58,160
You're a daughter

642
00:30:59,400 --> 00:31:00,440
and a mother.

643
00:31:03,719 --> 00:31:04,680
Besides,

644
00:31:05,999 --> 00:31:07,640
you have many friends who love you.

645
00:31:09,479 --> 00:31:10,160
Right?

646
00:31:16,239 --> 00:31:16,999
Promise me.

647
00:31:18,999 --> 00:31:20,239
Live well.

648
00:31:24,440 --> 00:31:25,519
Love yourself.

649
00:31:45,840 --> 00:31:46,600
You can do this.

650
00:31:47,840 --> 00:31:48,920
My little princess.

651
00:32:06,260 --> 00:32:10,540
(Department of Critical Care Medicine)

652
00:32:44,039 --> 00:32:44,680
Dad.

653
00:32:44,960 --> 00:32:45,759
Go back to sleep.

654
00:32:47,160 --> 00:32:47,999
Slowly.

655
00:32:48,519 --> 00:32:49,759
When did you get here?

656
00:32:50,319 --> 00:32:51,120
Just now.

657
00:32:54,759 --> 00:32:56,799
You've been sleeping here like this?

658
00:32:58,920 --> 00:33:00,319
This is all we have here.

659
00:33:00,440 --> 00:33:02,719
Meiqi and I take care of each other.
It's fine.

660
00:33:03,239 --> 00:33:05,440
If I'd known, I would've
come over to switch shifts.

661
00:33:05,440 --> 00:33:06,840
No need for that.

662
00:33:06,840 --> 00:33:08,319
We're young. We can handle it.

663
00:33:10,279 --> 00:33:11,200
Silly girl.

664
00:33:17,640 --> 00:33:18,559
Take this.

665
00:33:20,880 --> 00:33:21,950
I can't accept it anymore.

666
00:33:21,960 --> 00:33:23,319
It's not from me.

667
00:33:23,880 --> 00:33:26,200
It's from Xu Dacheng.

668
00:33:26,200 --> 00:33:27,260
He said it was for emergencies.

669
00:33:27,279 --> 00:33:28,640
I definitely can't take it.

670
00:33:28,920 --> 00:33:30,759
Zhixia just sent 50,000 a few days ago.

671
00:33:31,719 --> 00:33:32,799
Let's keep things straight.

672
00:33:33,160 --> 00:33:34,410
He gave it to you, so take it.

673
00:33:36,960 --> 00:33:39,600
He literally gave his life to you.

674
00:33:39,799 --> 00:33:40,880
He sold his motorcycle.

675
00:33:46,559 --> 00:33:48,239
Aren't you afraid they'll win me over?

676
00:33:48,960 --> 00:33:49,640
Why would I be?

677
00:33:51,640 --> 00:33:53,799
No one can take my daughter away
from me.

678
00:33:56,640 --> 00:33:57,920
Sit down.

679
00:33:57,999 --> 00:33:59,400
Alright. You sit too.

680
00:34:03,719 --> 00:34:05,200
Miss.

681
00:34:05,840 --> 00:34:06,640
You're awake.

682
00:34:07,160 --> 00:34:07,880
Look at this.

683
00:34:07,880 --> 00:34:09,240
Look what I bought.

684
00:34:09,280 --> 00:34:11,760
Instant noodles, Laba congee,
and dim sum.

685
00:34:12,559 --> 00:34:14,199
The supermarket is having a sale.

686
00:34:14,760 --> 00:34:17,240
Everything is so cheap.

687
00:34:17,240 --> 00:34:18,599
Which supermarket?

688
00:34:18,599 --> 00:34:20,599
The one on the right when you walk out.

689
00:34:21,440 --> 00:34:22,079
I know that one.

690
00:34:22,079 --> 00:34:23,119
You should go too.

691
00:34:23,119 --> 00:34:23,880
I'll go buy some.

692
00:34:23,880 --> 00:34:25,119
No, don't go. I'll go.

693
00:34:25,240 --> 00:34:27,119
You've been eating these
for the past few days?

694
00:34:27,920 --> 00:34:29,240
Let me tell you.

695
00:34:29,440 --> 00:34:30,670
When you're at death's door,

696
00:34:30,880 --> 00:34:32,999
having this is good enough.

697
00:34:33,250 --> 00:34:35,039
My daughter has never had
to eat like this.

698
00:34:35,039 --> 00:34:36,639
Tell me what you want to eat.

699
00:34:37,039 --> 00:34:39,079
I'll ask Minghui to bring it.

700
00:34:39,720 --> 00:34:41,599
My dad runs a restaurant.

701
00:34:41,920 --> 00:34:43,280
Yes, I...

702
00:34:44,240 --> 00:34:45,880
I really need to say this.

703
00:34:46,999 --> 00:34:49,760
You have to treat your daughter better.

704
00:34:49,760 --> 00:34:51,519
She's carrying a baby now

705
00:34:51,760 --> 00:34:53,360
and waiting for her mother-in-law

706
00:34:53,360 --> 00:34:54,639
without resting.

707
00:34:54,639 --> 00:34:56,519
She never once complained

708
00:34:56,519 --> 00:34:57,800
or said she was tired.

709
00:34:58,039 --> 00:34:59,760
And her smile.

710
00:35:01,320 --> 00:35:02,559
She smiles at everyone.

711
00:35:02,920 --> 00:35:03,920
I felt like

712
00:35:04,559 --> 00:35:06,639
the death's door closed again.

713
00:35:06,639 --> 00:35:08,559
Thank you so much.

714
00:35:08,600 --> 00:35:09,639
You haven't eaten, right?

715
00:35:09,639 --> 00:35:10,559
It's fine.

716
00:35:10,559 --> 00:35:11,559
I'll go buy.

717
00:35:11,559 --> 00:35:13,039
I bought soy milk.

718
00:35:13,039 --> 00:35:13,760
No, I'll buy.

719
00:35:13,760 --> 00:35:14,760
No need.

720
00:35:14,760 --> 00:35:15,320
Take it.

721
00:35:16,479 --> 00:35:17,079
Miss.

722
00:35:17,320 --> 00:35:18,119
Take it.

723
00:35:18,119 --> 00:35:18,639
Soy milk.

724
00:35:18,639 --> 00:35:20,250
- You bought soy milk again.
- Drink it while it's warm.

725
00:35:20,280 --> 00:35:22,240
Yeah. It's nice to drink.

726
00:35:22,999 --> 00:35:24,400
I added lots of sugar.

727
00:35:25,559 --> 00:35:27,920
Let's add a little sweetness to life.

728
00:35:28,479 --> 00:35:29,639
Yes, sweetness.

729
00:35:29,639 --> 00:35:31,840
Let's toast.

730
00:35:31,999 --> 00:35:32,639
Cheers.

731
00:35:32,880 --> 00:35:33,599
Cheers.

732
00:35:34,039 --> 00:35:34,760
Cheers.

733
00:35:37,240 --> 00:35:38,039
Keep it down.

734
00:35:38,720 --> 00:35:39,920
It tastes good.

735
00:35:43,119 --> 00:35:44,230
Excuse me. I'm here to pay.

736
00:35:44,240 --> 00:35:44,760
Alright.

737
00:35:46,400 --> 00:35:47,440
I have cash.

738
00:35:47,460 --> 00:35:48,830
If it's not enough, I'll use my card.

739
00:35:48,840 --> 00:35:49,400
Okay.

740
00:35:51,119 --> 00:35:53,119
This bag was hard to get at that time.

741
00:35:54,639 --> 00:35:55,760
It's nice.

742
00:35:56,240 --> 00:35:57,280
Why are you selling it?

743
00:35:58,540 --> 00:36:00,320
I have too many bags.
I can't use them all.

744
00:36:19,570 --> 00:36:20,800
The buttons are still perfect.

745
00:36:20,800 --> 00:36:21,999
Not a bit rusty.

746
00:36:22,639 --> 00:36:23,280
Also,

747
00:36:23,960 --> 00:36:26,280
this design was also
very popular back then.

748
00:36:26,840 --> 00:36:27,559
So I bought it.

749
00:37:05,920 --> 00:37:06,840
He Lihua's family.

750
00:37:08,400 --> 00:37:08,999
Doctor.

751
00:37:09,079 --> 00:37:09,880
Don't worry.

752
00:37:10,720 --> 00:37:13,240
Your mom can be transferred
to a regular ward today.

753
00:37:14,999 --> 00:37:16,039
Get ready.

754
00:37:16,119 --> 00:37:17,920
Thank you, doctor.

755
00:37:17,920 --> 00:37:19,240
- Thank you.
- Thank you so much.

756
00:37:29,039 --> 00:37:31,720
Even though she's been
transferred to a regular ward,

757
00:37:32,360 --> 00:37:33,599
she still needs time

758
00:37:33,840 --> 00:37:35,360
to fully recover.

759
00:37:35,840 --> 00:37:37,920
It'll be tough for you for a while.

760
00:37:38,639 --> 00:37:40,240
If anything comes up, call me.

761
00:37:40,479 --> 00:37:41,039
Thank you.

762
00:37:41,039 --> 00:37:41,880
Sign the paper.

763
00:37:51,960 --> 00:37:52,559
Thank you.

764
00:38:03,440 --> 00:38:05,720
(My mother-in-law has finally
moved to a regular ward.)

765
00:38:06,679 --> 00:38:08,199
(The toughest days)

766
00:38:08,599 --> 00:38:10,119
(are behind us at last.)

767
00:38:11,280 --> 00:38:13,599
(There are still many problems ahead)

768
00:38:13,720 --> 00:38:15,199
(and many hurdles to cross.)

769
00:38:16,039 --> 00:38:17,999
(But Meiqi and I believe)

770
00:38:18,199 --> 00:38:21,039
(the hardest part is over.)

771
00:38:25,119 --> 00:38:26,400
Go! Come on!

772
00:38:32,960 --> 00:38:34,079
You guys continue.

773
00:38:34,599 --> 00:38:35,400
Wait.

774
00:38:36,280 --> 00:38:36,999
Mr. Hua.

775
00:38:37,320 --> 00:38:38,119
Where are you going?

776
00:38:38,639 --> 00:38:39,479
Mr. Hua.

777
00:38:41,119 --> 00:38:42,599
What's the matter?

778
00:38:42,960 --> 00:38:44,410
I have something to discuss with you.

779
00:38:45,920 --> 00:38:48,280
Can the canteen
prepay next year's pork chop order?

780
00:38:50,320 --> 00:38:50,999
Next year?

781
00:38:51,479 --> 00:38:52,039
Yes.

782
00:38:52,440 --> 00:38:53,360
If you pay this year,

783
00:38:53,530 --> 00:38:54,960
you'll get a 12% discount next year.

784
00:38:55,280 --> 00:38:56,119
Good deal.

785
00:38:57,559 --> 00:38:59,079
We don't know about this year yet.

786
00:38:59,479 --> 00:39:01,079
Who can guarantee next year?

787
00:39:01,479 --> 00:39:02,639
What if I get reassigned?

788
00:39:02,760 --> 00:39:04,880
What if you get into college?

789
00:39:05,240 --> 00:39:06,639
You said "what if".

790
00:39:07,119 --> 00:39:07,960
Think of it this way.

791
00:39:08,079 --> 00:39:10,119
We lock in the discount with time,

792
00:39:10,400 --> 00:39:12,039
and use trust to earn trust.

793
00:39:13,479 --> 00:39:15,079
You're too eloquent.

794
00:39:15,240 --> 00:39:16,559
You should try something harder.

795
00:39:16,559 --> 00:39:17,800
Go study broadcasting.

796
00:39:19,119 --> 00:39:19,840
Mr. Hua.

797
00:39:20,079 --> 00:39:21,160
I need to be somewhere else.

798
00:39:22,119 --> 00:39:22,999
Money-grabber Shen,

799
00:39:23,999 --> 00:39:25,760
your plan failed.

800
00:39:28,140 --> 00:39:29,210
Let's go for another round.

801
00:39:38,740 --> 00:39:41,460
(Register to start live streaming.
Shen Minghui)

802
00:39:47,260 --> 00:39:48,860
(Congratulations.
Registration successful)

803
00:39:57,079 --> 00:39:58,559
Dad, Mom,

804
00:39:59,080 --> 00:40:00,079
I'm doing live streaming.

805
00:40:01,159 --> 00:40:02,440
Don't mess around.

806
00:40:02,540 --> 00:40:04,079
Go upstairs and finish your homework.

807
00:40:04,079 --> 00:40:04,960
I finished.

808
00:40:06,360 --> 00:40:07,479
You finished

809
00:40:07,880 --> 00:40:09,159
senior-year homework?

810
00:40:09,160 --> 00:40:10,639
I couldn't finish it
back in my third senior year,

811
00:40:10,639 --> 00:40:11,920
but now I'm in my fifth.

812
00:40:11,999 --> 00:40:12,999
How could I not finish?

813
00:40:14,320 --> 00:40:14,960
Be good.

814
00:40:15,639 --> 00:40:16,880
Show your best later.

815
00:40:17,519 --> 00:40:18,599
It's a global live stream.

816
00:40:18,880 --> 00:40:20,199
Everyone can see you.

817
00:40:21,760 --> 00:40:22,360
Alright.

818
00:40:33,999 --> 00:40:35,639
Hello, everyone.

819
00:40:36,119 --> 00:40:38,559
I'm your Money-grabber Shen.

820
00:40:38,960 --> 00:40:39,519
That's right.

821
00:40:39,519 --> 00:40:41,479
It's my first day streaming.

822
00:40:41,479 --> 00:40:42,400
My debut.

823
00:40:42,639 --> 00:40:43,240
Guys,

824
00:40:43,240 --> 00:40:44,479
if you're here, don't leave.

825
00:40:44,479 --> 00:40:47,119
We're giving things away.
Nothing for sale.

826
00:40:47,840 --> 00:40:49,840
First, let me introduce myself.

827
00:40:50,119 --> 00:40:53,519
I'm the young boss of Shen Restaurant,

828
00:40:53,519 --> 00:40:54,639
Money-grabber Shen.

829
00:40:54,740 --> 00:40:55,599
The Shen Restaurant...

830
00:40:55,599 --> 00:40:56,240
Dacheng,

831
00:40:56,559 --> 00:40:58,240
look at this.

832
00:40:58,240 --> 00:40:59,999
Isn't this Zhilu's brother?

833
00:40:59,999 --> 00:41:01,119
Everyone knows us.

834
00:41:01,160 --> 00:41:03,280
Give it another seventy years,
our restaurant will...

835
00:41:03,280 --> 00:41:03,840
Zhidong.

836
00:41:04,079 --> 00:41:04,880
Zhidong.

837
00:41:06,599 --> 00:41:07,199
Look.

838
00:41:07,240 --> 00:41:09,320
Look around.
We have many customers here.

839
00:41:09,639 --> 00:41:10,400
See?

840
00:41:11,039 --> 00:41:12,280
How's the food?

841
00:41:12,280 --> 00:41:12,639
Delicious.

842
00:41:12,639 --> 00:41:14,840
I must say,

843
00:41:15,440 --> 00:41:17,360
this boy doesn't talk
this smoothly at school.

844
00:41:17,720 --> 00:41:19,199
He's good at promoting.

845
00:41:19,519 --> 00:41:20,360
Come on.

846
00:41:20,479 --> 00:41:22,639
He's got some talent for live streaming.

847
00:41:24,519 --> 00:41:25,320
Look at this.

848
00:41:25,320 --> 00:41:27,280
Is this Zhilu's brother?

849
00:41:27,280 --> 00:41:28,119
That's Minghui.

850
00:41:28,639 --> 00:41:30,159
Minghui? The one you fought with?

851
00:41:30,159 --> 00:41:31,079
I beat him up.

852
00:41:32,960 --> 00:41:34,039
Good.

853
00:41:34,599 --> 00:41:35,400
Excellent.

854
00:41:36,960 --> 00:41:37,599
And this.

855
00:41:37,999 --> 00:41:39,199
It's Mr. Shen.

856
00:41:41,519 --> 00:41:42,400
Look.

857
00:41:42,840 --> 00:41:46,199
The boss of Shen Restaurant.

858
00:41:46,720 --> 00:41:49,360
Look at him cook. Smooth, fast,

859
00:41:49,360 --> 00:41:50,599
and dashing.

860
00:41:51,220 --> 00:41:51,960
What do you think?

861
00:41:52,280 --> 00:41:54,320
My dad looks cool, right?

862
00:41:54,880 --> 00:41:57,079
If you think he's cool,
type "1" in the chat.

863
00:41:57,320 --> 00:41:59,079
If the screen fills with "1",

864
00:41:59,159 --> 00:42:01,999
I'll give out vouchers.

865
00:42:03,280 --> 00:42:04,639
88 vouchers!

866
00:42:05,479 --> 00:42:06,039
Type 1.

867
00:42:06,039 --> 00:42:06,639
Only eight people.

868
00:42:06,639 --> 00:42:07,119
Come on.

869
00:42:07,119 --> 00:42:07,800
It's fine.

870
00:42:07,800 --> 00:42:08,320
Type 1.

871
00:42:08,320 --> 00:42:09,920
Even if there are only eight, it's fine.

872
00:42:10,159 --> 00:42:11,870
If there are more people,
we give out more.

873
00:42:12,119 --> 00:42:14,639
If there are fewer, we give even more.

874
00:42:15,119 --> 00:42:15,960
Right, Dad?

875
00:42:17,760 --> 00:42:19,880
Hey, I didn't prepare
that many ingredients.

876
00:42:19,999 --> 00:42:20,960
Give out less.

877
00:42:21,360 --> 00:42:23,079
It's a global live stream.
Everyone is watching.

878
00:42:23,079 --> 00:42:23,999
Watch your words.

879
00:42:24,639 --> 00:42:26,240
My dad's panicking.

880
00:42:26,250 --> 00:42:27,120
We're giving out more.

881
00:42:27,199 --> 00:42:28,720
My dad's panicking.

882
00:42:29,280 --> 00:42:30,039
Guys,

883
00:42:30,400 --> 00:42:31,440
as you can see,

884
00:42:31,440 --> 00:42:33,119
the Shen Restaurant

885
00:42:33,479 --> 00:42:34,519
is small,

886
00:42:34,620 --> 00:42:36,320
and we don't have
a huge supply capacity.

887
00:42:36,599 --> 00:42:37,800
But that's okay.

888
00:42:37,840 --> 00:42:39,479
Because we're launching

889
00:42:39,479 --> 00:42:40,880
a brand-new product line,

890
00:42:41,240 --> 00:42:42,920
