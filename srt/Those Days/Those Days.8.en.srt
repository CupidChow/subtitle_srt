(Adapted from iceread.com novel
"You Xi" by Qingyang Wanxi)

00:01:15,220 --> 00:01:17,940
=Episode 8=

4
00:01:27,320 --> 00:01:28,201
Miss Shen.

5
00:01:30,921 --> 00:01:32,220
We'll cover the medical expenses.

6
00:01:33,641 --> 00:01:34,520
You should'nt.

7
00:01:34,841 --> 00:01:36,401
My brother didn't go to the hospital.

8
00:01:36,761 --> 00:01:38,681
It's just a scrape, nothing serious.

9
00:01:40,001 --> 00:01:40,841
Glad to hear that.

10
00:01:42,641 --> 00:01:43,401
Miss Shen.

11
00:01:45,401 --> 00:01:46,201
Mingzhu.

12
00:01:48,281 --> 00:01:49,880
But my mom is not doing well.

13
00:01:52,160 --> 00:01:53,561
You refused to reconnect with her.

14
00:01:54,520 --> 00:01:57,201
She's stopped eating
and can't sleep at night.

15
00:01:58,240 --> 00:02:00,160
She just wallows in sadness all day.

16
00:02:00,160 --> 00:02:02,201
Looks like she's about to fall ill.

17
00:02:03,681 --> 00:02:04,720
If I do reconnect with her,

18
00:02:05,561 --> 00:02:07,240
then it'll be my mom who gets sick.

19
00:02:08,920 --> 00:02:09,720
Mingzhu.

20
00:02:10,600 --> 00:02:12,801
I know our family owes you.

21
00:02:13,121 --> 00:02:14,841
But please, hear me out.

22
00:02:15,640 --> 00:02:16,681
It was...

23
00:02:17,320 --> 00:02:19,081
My grandma was
the one who sent you away.

24
00:02:19,081 --> 00:02:20,521
My parents knew nothing.

25
00:02:20,521 --> 00:02:22,281
They always thought when you were born,

26
00:02:23,320 --> 00:02:24,440
you didn't make it.

27
00:02:27,801 --> 00:02:28,961
It wasn't until Grandma

28
00:02:28,961 --> 00:02:30,920
was on her deathbed
that she told the truth.

29
00:02:31,361 --> 00:02:32,841
My parents are worried sick.

30
00:02:32,841 --> 00:02:34,121
They searched everywhere for you.

31
00:02:35,401 --> 00:02:36,241
Mingzhu,

32
00:02:37,841 --> 00:02:39,160
they're innocent.

33
00:02:42,241 --> 00:02:43,801
Then, who's guilty?

34
00:02:48,281 --> 00:02:50,001
That's not what I meant.

35
00:02:50,001 --> 00:02:51,760
What's done is done,

36
00:02:52,681 --> 00:02:54,241
we might as well let it be.

37
00:02:55,320 --> 00:02:56,841
My parents treat me very well.

38
00:02:57,720 --> 00:02:58,760
To me,

39
00:02:59,600 --> 00:03:01,241
they're my real parents.

40
00:03:01,401 --> 00:03:02,200
Yes, you are right.

41
00:03:02,281 --> 00:03:04,561
Of course, we should
consider your parents' feelings.

42
00:03:04,801 --> 00:03:05,600
It's just that...

43
00:03:09,920 --> 00:03:14,200
Ever since you agreed
to teach Jiao piano,

44
00:03:14,200 --> 00:03:15,281
I could tell right away

45
00:03:15,281 --> 00:03:17,361
that you have a heart of gold.

46
00:03:20,480 --> 00:03:22,961
I want to ask you for a favor.

47
00:03:23,200 --> 00:03:25,521
Even if you're just pretending,

48
00:03:25,760 --> 00:03:28,880
could you at least
give my mom a smile?

49
00:03:28,880 --> 00:03:29,720
Please?

50
00:03:29,920 --> 00:03:30,720
No.

51
00:03:32,801 --> 00:03:34,001
I can't even fake a smile.

52
00:03:36,401 --> 00:03:37,880
Whatever the reason was,

53
00:03:39,081 --> 00:03:41,001
the fact is your family gave me away.

54
00:03:42,281 --> 00:03:43,961
Did you ever raise me for even one day?

55
00:03:44,841 --> 00:03:46,401
So why should I smile for you?

56
00:03:52,160 --> 00:03:54,640
I didn't mean it like that.

57
00:03:57,320 --> 00:03:58,801
When you see my mom,

58
00:04:00,600 --> 00:04:01,521
just nod your head,

59
00:04:02,320 --> 00:04:04,841
or say hello. Anything, really.

60
00:04:06,001 --> 00:04:08,081
Just think of it as doing a good deed.

61
00:04:08,801 --> 00:04:09,561
My husband

62
00:04:09,561 --> 00:04:11,241
tried to do a good deed, and he...

63
00:04:15,040 --> 00:04:15,841
Mingzhu...

64
00:04:18,280 --> 00:04:19,601
I don't have a choice either.

65
00:04:21,200 --> 00:04:23,080
Right now, you're
the only cure my mom's got.

66
00:04:24,041 --> 00:04:25,241
So to you, I'm just a cure?

67
00:04:26,561 --> 00:04:28,280
I'm still trying to find my own cure.

68
00:04:29,921 --> 00:04:31,361
My husband's gone now.

69
00:04:32,241 --> 00:04:33,960
And I'm pregnant.

70
00:04:34,320 --> 00:04:35,921
I don't even know what to do.

71
00:04:38,001 --> 00:04:39,350
I can't bring myself to give it up,

72
00:04:40,241 --> 00:04:41,561
but I'm scared to keep it.

73
00:04:42,080 --> 00:04:44,520
I'm terrified it's a cornual pregnancy,
that I'll hemorrhage.

74
00:04:45,320 --> 00:04:47,161
I'm scared
I won't be able to raise the baby.

75
00:04:47,561 --> 00:04:49,880
I'm scared one day my child will
ask me where their dad is.

76
00:04:50,320 --> 00:04:51,880
I'm drowning in lawsuits right now.

77
00:04:51,880 --> 00:04:53,001
And you're calling me a cure?

78
00:04:53,440 --> 00:04:55,080
Can I really heal anyone?

79
00:04:55,721 --> 00:04:57,121
Do I even have that power?

80
00:05:00,561 --> 00:05:01,320
I...

81
00:05:02,840 --> 00:05:04,721
Mingzhu, I really do understand you.

82
00:05:07,361 --> 00:05:09,400
I know exactly what you're saying.

83
00:05:10,640 --> 00:05:11,440
I get it.

84
00:05:12,361 --> 00:05:14,400
All of this

85
00:05:15,320 --> 00:05:17,161
came at you so suddenly.

86
00:05:17,640 --> 00:05:18,520
And I also know that

87
00:05:18,520 --> 00:05:20,200
bringing this up right now

88
00:05:20,200 --> 00:05:22,121
is really bad timing.

89
00:05:22,921 --> 00:05:25,241
But, ever since my parents
learned of your existence,

90
00:05:25,241 --> 00:05:28,001
they can't eat, can't sleep.
They fight every single day.

91
00:05:28,561 --> 00:05:29,320
I...

92
00:05:35,320 --> 00:05:36,520
There's one more thing.

93
00:05:36,921 --> 00:05:38,721
I need to apologize to you for it.

94
00:05:38,721 --> 00:05:40,041
That day at the precinct,

95
00:05:40,320 --> 00:05:42,361
I took a few strands of your hair.

96
00:05:42,361 --> 00:05:44,001
I didn't get your permission.

97
00:05:44,001 --> 00:05:45,001
I went ahead on my own

98
00:05:45,001 --> 00:05:46,361
and did a DNA test.

99
00:05:47,681 --> 00:05:48,681
The result shows it.

100
00:05:49,080 --> 00:05:50,481
We really are sisters.

101
00:05:51,080 --> 00:05:52,520
You're our family's child.

102
00:05:52,520 --> 00:05:53,721
We're family, Mingzhu.

103
00:05:53,721 --> 00:05:55,241
Mingzhu, look at this.

104
00:05:55,460 --> 00:05:58,460
♪Never forgets to strike♪

105
00:05:59,180 --> 00:06:02,540

have to swallow the pain♪

111
00:07:15,760 --> 00:07:16,640
I'm starving.

112
00:07:17,360 --> 00:07:17,880
You're back!

113
00:07:17,880 --> 00:07:19,601
Zhixia, you're finally back!

114
00:07:19,721 --> 00:07:20,721
That test thing?

115
00:07:20,760 --> 00:07:21,721
The paternity test?

116
00:07:21,721 --> 00:07:24,041
Did the results come out yet?

117
00:07:24,041 --> 00:07:25,361
That fast? No way.

118
00:07:26,001 --> 00:07:26,840
Then, then...

119
00:07:26,960 --> 00:07:28,840
How long does it usually take?

120
00:07:29,601 --> 00:07:30,320
Mom, don't worry.

121
00:07:30,320 --> 00:07:31,601
As soon as I get the results,

122
00:07:31,601 --> 00:07:33,801
you'll be the first to know, okay?

123
00:07:34,481 --> 00:07:35,350
I'm starving. Come on.

124
00:07:35,360 --> 00:07:36,561
Zhidong, get me a bowl of rice.

125
00:07:36,561 --> 00:07:37,200
- Quick.
- Alright.

126
00:07:37,200 --> 00:07:38,880
I'll make you some soup too.

127
00:07:41,681 --> 00:07:42,400
Zhixia.

128
00:07:43,960 --> 00:07:46,561
They've both been
obsessed with that DNA test.

129
00:07:46,561 --> 00:07:47,760
They haven't even been eating.

130
00:07:47,770 --> 00:07:49,390
Like monks trying
to reach enlightenment.

131
00:07:49,400 --> 00:07:51,121
Oh, so you do know
they've stopped eating?

132
00:07:51,121 --> 00:07:53,200
And here you are,
stuffing your face, huh?

133
00:07:53,200 --> 00:07:54,721
Can't you care about them a little?

134
00:07:54,721 --> 00:07:56,121
I really was hungry.

135
00:07:56,121 --> 00:07:57,240
Since they aren't eating...

136
00:07:59,041 --> 00:07:59,840
Dad, what's wrong?

137
00:08:03,681 --> 00:08:04,721
What's wrong, Dad?

138
00:08:05,241 --> 00:08:06,561
Tell me the truth.

139
00:08:06,801 --> 00:08:08,041
The results aren't out yet?

140
00:08:08,361 --> 00:08:09,200
No.

141
00:08:09,561 --> 00:08:10,400
Come here.

142
00:08:11,520 --> 00:08:13,681
Are you hiding it because you think

143
00:08:13,681 --> 00:08:14,880
your mom might overreact?

144
00:08:15,561 --> 00:08:17,001
Don't be silly.

145
00:08:17,361 --> 00:08:18,161
Zhixia.

146
00:08:18,681 --> 00:08:20,400
Your mom and I are not the same.

147
00:08:20,520 --> 00:08:23,001
I know we can't rush this.

148
00:08:23,280 --> 00:08:26,840
The last thing I want is to
reconnect with the wrong person again.

149
00:08:39,800 --> 00:08:41,361
Keep it secret.

150
00:08:45,540 --> 00:08:47,460
(Supporting Yu Jingxiang
as Shen Mingzhu's biological mother)

151
00:08:50,441 --> 00:08:51,321
Keep it secret.

152
00:08:54,280 --> 00:08:56,481
Whatever happens,
don't let Mom find out.

153
00:08:56,721 --> 00:08:58,800
You know
what kind of temper she has.

154
00:08:58,800 --> 00:08:59,160
I know.

155
00:08:59,160 --> 00:09:00,560
She's still sick,
still on medication.

156
00:09:00,560 --> 00:09:01,760
She can't handle any stress.

157
00:09:02,121 --> 00:09:03,040
Got it, got it.

158
00:09:04,400 --> 00:09:05,601
I'll keep it safe.

159
00:09:06,520 --> 00:09:07,441
Comrade Xu Dacheng.

160
00:09:07,441 --> 00:09:08,121
Here!

161
00:09:08,601 --> 00:09:09,880
Can I trust you?

162
00:09:10,400 --> 00:09:11,560
You have my word.

163
00:09:12,680 --> 00:09:13,680
Now go eat.

164
00:09:19,121 --> 00:09:20,321
Mom, are you done?

165
00:09:27,721 --> 00:09:28,601
Miss Shen.

166
00:09:28,601 --> 00:09:29,361
Thank you.

167
00:09:29,520 --> 00:09:31,680
The manager already
told me about your situation.

168
00:09:31,680 --> 00:09:33,361
I'll process your refund right away.

169
00:09:33,721 --> 00:09:34,441
Thanks.

170
00:09:34,441 --> 00:09:36,361
Please wait a moment,
I'll grab the paperwork.

171
00:09:51,520 --> 00:09:52,721
Honey, you look beautiful.

172
00:10:03,121 --> 00:10:05,400
Here's your refund amount.
Please check it.

173
00:10:06,081 --> 00:10:07,400
I'll need your signature here.

174
00:10:14,441 --> 00:10:16,601
This is for you.
Keep it as a memento.

175
00:10:23,760 --> 00:10:26,800
Your husband was
truly an incredible man.

176
00:10:29,760 --> 00:10:30,841
He really was.

00:11:03,441 --> 00:11:04,680
Hurry, sign up at my desk.

187
00:11:04,760 --> 00:11:07,241
Head of Human Resources Department?

188
00:11:07,601 --> 00:11:10,001
Nah, not for me.
I'm not cut out to be a boss.

189
00:11:11,400 --> 00:11:13,160
I have to pick up my little princess.

190
00:11:13,560 --> 00:11:14,481
See you, Song.

191
00:11:14,481 --> 00:11:15,160
But...

192
00:11:15,560 --> 00:11:16,361
Bye-bye.

193
00:11:18,601 --> 00:11:19,160
Let's go.

194
00:11:20,040 --> 00:11:20,880
Put on your slippers.

195
00:11:24,361 --> 00:11:25,601
Mom, we're back.

196
00:11:26,040 --> 00:11:26,880
Hi, Grandma!

197
00:11:27,640 --> 00:11:28,640
Braised chicken wings!

198
00:11:31,160 --> 00:11:31,961
Put it down.

199
00:11:32,400 --> 00:11:34,160
Put it down, come on.

200
00:11:34,160 --> 00:11:34,961
That's right.

201
00:11:35,361 --> 00:11:36,760
Homework comes first.

202
00:11:37,481 --> 00:11:40,121
Never leave today's work for tomorrow.

203
00:11:41,121 --> 00:11:42,520
Go on, do your homework.

204
00:11:46,400 --> 00:11:47,241
You've got this.

205
00:11:59,040 --> 00:11:59,800
Zhang Hao.

206
00:12:00,640 --> 00:12:01,680
Let me tell you something.

207
00:12:01,961 --> 00:12:04,001
I don't mind
helping you cook once in a while,

208
00:12:04,280 --> 00:12:06,040
but that's not my job.

209
00:12:06,040 --> 00:12:09,361
I'm just here
to lend a hand temporarily.

210
00:12:10,121 --> 00:12:11,400
You and Zhixia

211
00:12:11,961 --> 00:12:13,481
need to take responsibility.

212
00:12:14,640 --> 00:12:16,361
Running your little family well

213
00:12:16,560 --> 00:12:19,800
should be your top priority right now.

214
00:12:20,040 --> 00:12:20,721
Got it, got it.

215
00:12:20,721 --> 00:12:21,880
Do you really?

216
00:12:21,880 --> 00:12:23,841
I know
I shouldn't have asked you to cook.

217
00:12:24,001 --> 00:12:25,081
I'm sorry.

218
00:12:25,081 --> 00:12:26,580
Just this once. It won't happen again.

219
00:12:27,481 --> 00:12:28,650
What kind of attitude is that?

220
00:12:29,400 --> 00:12:30,680
My attitude?

221
00:12:30,841 --> 00:12:32,760
We're really grateful for your help.

222
00:12:32,760 --> 00:12:34,640
If you don't have the time,
that's fine too.

223
00:12:34,640 --> 00:12:35,520
But please,

224
00:12:35,520 --> 00:12:37,321
don't scold us while you're helping out.

225
00:12:37,321 --> 00:12:38,680
It just makes us feel stressed.

226
00:12:38,680 --> 00:12:40,001
Oh? So I'm wrong to criticize?

227
00:12:41,721 --> 00:12:42,880
Your wife is pregnant

228
00:12:43,400 --> 00:12:45,361
and still running
to her mom's house every day.

229
00:12:45,560 --> 00:12:47,321
She's helping them with their so-called

230
00:12:47,680 --> 00:12:49,201
"family issues from the past."

231
00:12:49,201 --> 00:12:50,481
And what about her own home?

232
00:12:50,520 --> 00:12:51,601
Doesn't she care?

233
00:12:52,721 --> 00:12:54,560
Is that what a wife
and a mother should be?

234
00:12:54,560 --> 00:12:55,940
Is that the example she's setting?

235
00:13:02,160 --> 00:13:02,961
You're back.

236
00:13:09,601 --> 00:13:11,601
Mom, thank you for all your help.

237
00:13:11,961 --> 00:13:12,880
It's nothing.

238
00:13:14,280 --> 00:13:16,961
It must be tiring to be
running back and forth while pregnant.

239
00:13:17,680 --> 00:13:18,640
That's even tougher.

240
00:13:22,660 --> 00:13:23,760
- You must be...
- I'll wash my hands.

241
00:13:23,760 --> 00:13:25,481
I'm here to give you a hug.

242
00:13:28,241 --> 00:13:29,140
It sure is hard on me.

243
00:13:36,040 --> 00:13:37,880
Hello, do you have a reservation?

244
00:13:38,001 --> 00:13:39,201
Yes, under Shen.

245
00:13:40,400 --> 00:13:41,241
Miss Shen?

246
00:13:41,241 --> 00:13:41,441
Yes.

247
00:13:41,441 --> 00:13:43,121
It's your birthday today, right?

248
00:13:43,121 --> 00:13:43,800
Happy birthday.

249
00:13:43,800 --> 00:13:44,201
Thank you.

250
00:13:44,201 --> 00:13:44,880
This way, please.

251
00:13:45,081 --> 00:13:45,841
Mom?

252
00:13:49,520 --> 00:13:50,001
Sure.

253
00:13:50,001 --> 00:13:51,001
Okay, thank you.

254
00:13:51,441 --> 00:13:52,560
There's a little lamp too.

255
00:13:55,241 --> 00:13:56,241
So lovely.

256
00:13:56,601 --> 00:13:57,441
Indeed.

257
00:13:58,121 --> 00:13:58,680
Lovely.

258
00:13:58,680 --> 00:14:00,520
You can take a look at the menu first.

259
00:14:00,640 --> 00:14:01,441
Thank you.

260
00:14:03,280 --> 00:14:03,760
Oh my…

261
00:14:04,121 --> 00:14:04,400
Look.

262
00:14:04,400 --> 00:14:06,321
I already placed the order online.

263
00:14:06,321 --> 00:14:07,800
Just go with what I ordered.

264
00:14:07,800 --> 00:14:08,481
Sure.

265
00:14:09,680 --> 00:14:10,520
Please wait a moment.

266
00:14:11,160 --> 00:14:12,361
Sweetheart, let's not eat here.

267
00:14:12,361 --> 00:14:13,270
It's way too expensive.

268
00:14:14,121 --> 00:14:15,400
One crab costs

269
00:14:15,400 --> 00:14:17,800
a whopping 1,688 yuan!

270
00:14:18,280 --> 00:14:19,760
I've already paid for it.

271
00:14:19,880 --> 00:14:21,880
Besides, it's not like
we come here often.

272
00:14:21,880 --> 00:14:23,400
It's just once a year.

273
00:14:23,560 --> 00:14:24,721
We're already here.

274
00:14:25,001 --> 00:14:26,321
It's my sister's birthday today.

275
00:14:26,321 --> 00:14:27,441
She's the boss tonight.

276
00:14:27,680 --> 00:14:28,721
We'll do as she says.

277
00:14:28,721 --> 00:14:29,961
Oh, come on.

278
00:14:30,241 --> 00:14:32,001
Do you know how much
she's spending on this?

279
00:14:32,961 --> 00:14:34,201
Mom, let me show you.

280
00:14:36,481 --> 00:14:37,721
Since I started working,

281
00:14:38,121 --> 00:14:39,961
I've been eating and living at home.

282
00:14:40,201 --> 00:14:41,601
I've managed to save quite a bit.

283
00:14:41,760 --> 00:14:42,601
See?

284
00:14:44,961 --> 00:14:48,040
This money was
meant for my wedding.

285
00:14:48,540 --> 00:14:49,481
I didn't get to use it.

286
00:14:52,001 --> 00:14:53,760
Are you that eager to splurge?

287
00:14:53,760 --> 00:14:55,640
There's always
somewhere to spend money, right?

288
00:14:55,640 --> 00:14:56,441
It's fine.

289
00:14:56,640 --> 00:14:59,081
Jianqi recommended
this restaurant so many times.

290
00:14:59,081 --> 00:15:01,201
He always said he'd bring us here.

291
00:15:01,760 --> 00:15:04,361
He didn't get the chance,
so I'm doing it for him.

292
00:15:07,160 --> 00:15:07,841
Yeah.

293
00:15:07,841 --> 00:15:09,800
If only Jianqi were still here…

294
00:15:11,280 --> 00:15:13,800
Don't bring that up now.

295
00:15:14,800 --> 00:15:15,640
Alright, I won't.

296
00:15:16,721 --> 00:15:17,481
Sweetheart,

297
00:15:17,481 --> 00:15:18,880
I'll say this again.

298
00:15:19,481 --> 00:15:21,680
If you really want to have this baby,

299
00:15:21,760 --> 00:15:23,241
even if the Feng family won't help,

300
00:15:23,560 --> 00:15:24,880
you've got us right here.

301
00:15:24,880 --> 00:15:26,040
Raising a baby

302
00:15:26,040 --> 00:15:27,321
won't be a problem for us.

303
00:15:27,321 --> 00:15:28,121
Exactly.

304
00:15:29,601 --> 00:15:31,241
My sister is the best.

305
00:15:31,400 --> 00:15:32,841
She's treating us to crab tonight!

306
00:15:33,361 --> 00:15:34,560
Eat up, okay?

307
00:15:34,560 --> 00:15:36,800
Of course.
I'm eating until your paycheck's gone.

308
00:15:45,520 --> 00:15:48,760
Happy birthday to you.

309
00:15:51,280 --> 00:15:52,160
Zhidong.

310
00:15:52,160 --> 00:15:52,841
Mom.

311
00:15:52,841 --> 00:15:54,760
Happy birthday.

312
00:15:56,361 --> 00:15:57,121
Thanks, Mom.

313
00:15:57,121 --> 00:15:57,841
Zhidong,

314
00:15:58,361 --> 00:15:59,841
it's your birthday today.

315
00:15:59,841 --> 00:16:02,601
Mom made you a bowl
of longevity noodles.

316
00:16:05,680 --> 00:16:06,841
It smells great, right?

317
00:16:10,560 --> 00:16:14,001
A son's birthday is
a mother's day of hardship.

318
00:16:14,160 --> 00:16:15,160
You've worked hard, Mom.

319
00:16:17,241 --> 00:16:20,241
Alright.
You're another year older now.

320
00:16:21,160 --> 00:16:23,280
Time to grow up a little.

321
00:16:23,760 --> 00:16:25,880
Get along well with Bichen, okay?

322
00:16:26,241 --> 00:16:27,560
We're doing great.

323
00:16:27,961 --> 00:16:28,721
Oh right,

324
00:16:29,040 --> 00:16:30,160
after you finish the noodles,

325
00:16:30,201 --> 00:16:31,560
you and Bichen

326
00:16:32,001 --> 00:16:33,601
are going out.

327
00:16:34,040 --> 00:16:35,481
Here, take this.

328
00:16:37,081 --> 00:16:39,280
Go have a nice meal together.

329
00:16:39,280 --> 00:16:40,520
It's okay, Mom. I've got money.

330
00:16:40,520 --> 00:16:41,961
No, this is from me.

331
00:16:41,961 --> 00:16:42,721
I've got money.

332
00:16:42,730 --> 00:16:43,640
- Hey.
- Listen to me.

333
00:16:43,640 --> 00:16:44,361
You don't have to.

334
00:16:44,361 --> 00:16:45,940
- You're always arguing.
- Hear me out.

335
00:16:47,520 --> 00:16:49,441
Chen's cultural center
has an event today.

336
00:16:49,841 --> 00:16:51,001
She couldn't come with me.

337
00:16:53,040 --> 00:16:53,800
That's fine.

338
00:16:54,560 --> 00:16:55,841
Why didn't you tell me sooner?

339
00:16:55,841 --> 00:16:56,481
But...

340
00:16:56,481 --> 00:16:58,640
We didn't even get you
a birthday cake or anything.

341
00:16:58,640 --> 00:16:59,760
This can't do.

342
00:16:59,760 --> 00:17:00,520
Xiang.

343
00:17:04,401 --> 00:17:06,040
Happy birthday, Zhidong.

344
00:17:07,280 --> 00:17:08,320
It's your birthday!

345
00:17:08,721 --> 00:17:09,161
Yeah.

346
00:17:09,161 --> 00:17:10,800
Happy birthday!

347
00:17:12,080 --> 00:17:14,161
And you said you didn't get a cake.

348
00:17:14,161 --> 00:17:14,961
You surprised me!

349
00:17:14,961 --> 00:17:15,320
What...

350
00:17:15,721 --> 00:17:16,520
Thanks, Dad.

351
00:17:17,201 --> 00:17:18,040
Wait.

352
00:17:20,320 --> 00:17:20,921
Zhidong.

353
00:17:21,241 --> 00:17:22,721
This one's for your second sister.

354
00:17:22,721 --> 00:17:23,241
Right.

355
00:17:23,241 --> 00:17:26,161
Are you never home for your birthday?

356
00:17:26,161 --> 00:17:26,760
Yeah.

357
00:17:26,760 --> 00:17:28,600
You said you'd celebrate with Bichen.

358
00:17:28,600 --> 00:17:31,840
Happy birthday, Mr. Zhidong!

359
00:17:32,441 --> 00:17:33,600
Bichen's here!

360
00:17:34,401 --> 00:17:36,881
That's great! Wonderful!

361
00:17:37,241 --> 00:17:38,001
That's great.

362
00:17:42,401 --> 00:17:44,681
You're so mean! Why'd you lie to me?

363
00:17:44,681 --> 00:17:46,241
I just wanted to surprise you.

364
00:17:46,241 --> 00:17:47,721
I almost wanted to skip my birthday.

365
00:17:47,721 --> 00:17:48,441
You know that?

366
00:17:48,441 --> 00:17:50,241
An event at the cultural center?

367
00:17:50,241 --> 00:17:51,600
You're the worst!

368
00:17:52,840 --> 00:17:53,641
Bichen!

369
00:17:54,760 --> 00:17:55,600
Bichen!

370
00:17:55,840 --> 00:17:56,641
Mrs. Feng.

371
00:17:57,760 --> 00:17:59,560
Well, since you're here,

372
00:17:59,560 --> 00:18:00,641
let's stay home.

373
00:18:00,641 --> 00:18:02,420
We'll make a nice family dinner!

374
00:18:02,420 --> 00:18:02,681
Yeah!

375
00:18:02,681 --> 00:18:04,760
Let's celebrate Zhidong's birthday.

376
00:18:04,760 --> 00:18:06,120
- Thank you, Mr. and Mrs. Feng!
- Sure!

377
00:18:06,120 --> 00:18:07,760
Okay, I'll go prepare it.

378
00:18:10,681 --> 00:18:11,760
Thanks, Mom.

379
00:18:12,001 --> 00:18:13,481
Hey, Dacheng!

380
00:18:15,520 --> 00:18:16,721
Coming.

381
00:18:16,961 --> 00:18:17,681
Okay!

382
00:18:17,681 --> 00:18:19,360
Alright, I'm coming.

383
00:18:20,360 --> 00:18:22,441
Hey, what do you think of these shoes?

384
00:18:27,320 --> 00:18:28,760
CR7!

385
00:18:29,401 --> 00:18:31,001
CR7!

386
00:18:31,641 --> 00:18:33,320
CR7!

387
00:18:34,120 --> 00:18:35,961
I saw you eyeing this pair for ages.

388
00:18:35,961 --> 00:18:37,080
Wait, you bought these?

389
00:18:37,080 --> 00:18:38,120
I can't bring myself

390
00:18:38,120 --> 00:18:39,681
to play football in these.

391
00:18:39,721 --> 00:18:41,120
Wear them in your next game.

392
00:18:41,120 --> 00:18:41,800
No way.

393
00:18:41,800 --> 00:18:43,620
I'm framing them
and putting them on display!

394
00:18:44,630 --> 00:18:46,201
- Here.
- This one tastes special, huh?

395
00:18:46,201 --> 00:18:46,840
Try the lobster.

396
00:18:46,850 --> 00:18:48,080
Thanks, Dad, I've got it.

397
00:18:48,080 --> 00:18:49,280
Eat more. This shrimp's good too.

398
00:18:49,280 --> 00:18:50,201
Okay.

399
00:18:51,080 --> 00:18:51,840
Mom,

400
00:18:52,520 --> 00:18:53,721
could you tone it down a bit?

401
00:18:54,001 --> 00:18:55,600
Your own son's sitting right here.

402
00:18:56,641 --> 00:18:57,441
Alright.

403
00:18:58,040 --> 00:18:58,800
Here.

404
00:19:00,040 --> 00:19:01,360
No food can stop you from talking.

405
00:19:01,441 --> 00:19:03,001
Eat like a civilized person.

406
00:19:03,201 --> 00:19:05,241
Learn from your sister.
Look how proper she eats.

407
00:19:05,241 --> 00:19:07,320
Mom, that's genetics.

408
00:19:07,560 --> 00:19:09,401
You know exactly who I take after.

409
00:19:09,721 --> 00:19:11,520
Enough talking. Eat up, okay?

410
00:19:11,530 --> 00:19:13,360
He's been studying so hard lately,
he needs brain food.

411
00:19:13,360 --> 00:19:14,320
Keep him nourished.

412
00:19:14,320 --> 00:19:15,441
You can have my piece.

413
00:19:15,800 --> 00:19:17,760
You're the best. Thanks, Zhixia!

414
00:19:23,241 --> 00:19:24,681
Today's Miss Shen's birthday.

415
00:19:24,681 --> 00:19:25,360
Our restaurant

416
00:19:25,360 --> 00:19:27,260
has prepared a mousse cake
especially for you.

417
00:19:27,401 --> 00:19:28,201
Thank you.

418
00:19:28,760 --> 00:19:29,641
Thank you so much.

419
00:19:29,641 --> 00:19:30,360
That's so nice.

420
00:19:30,721 --> 00:19:31,520
Lovely.

421
00:19:32,441 --> 00:19:33,001
The candles.

422
00:19:33,080 --> 00:19:34,001
Right, thanks.

423
00:19:34,201 --> 00:19:34,760
Here, Zhixia.

424
00:19:34,760 --> 00:19:35,401
Put this on.

425
00:19:35,401 --> 00:19:36,080
Okay.

426
00:19:38,401 --> 00:19:39,600
I'll light the candles.

427
00:19:43,080 --> 00:19:45,681
Come on, princess. Wear your crown.

428
00:19:47,001 --> 00:19:48,140
Let me put it on you, Zhixia.

429
00:19:48,220 --> 00:19:49,080
Give it to her first.

430
00:19:52,201 --> 00:19:53,001
How's that?

431
00:19:53,001 --> 00:19:53,560
Beautiful.

432
00:19:53,560 --> 00:19:55,401
Isn't it queens who wear crowns?

433
00:19:55,401 --> 00:19:57,560
My sister,
you're the queen of our family!

434
00:19:57,560 --> 00:19:59,401
Queen? She's a princess!

435
00:20:00,401 --> 00:20:01,001
Here we go.

436
00:20:05,120 --> 00:20:08,481
Happy birthday to you.

437
00:20:08,721 --> 00:20:12,921
- I'm recording this.
- Happy birthday to you.

438
00:20:13,120 --> 00:20:18,120
Happy birthday to you.

439
00:20:18,360 --> 00:20:23,360
Happy birthday to you.

440
00:20:25,721 --> 00:20:29,961
Happy birthday to you.

441
00:20:30,320 --> 00:20:32,320
Happy birthday to you.

442
00:20:32,360 --> 00:20:34,600
Look at this.
This is what a real family looks like.

443
00:20:34,600 --> 00:20:39,441
Happy birthday to you.

444
00:20:39,721 --> 00:20:44,001
Happy birthday to you.

445
00:20:44,161 --> 00:20:46,280
Hailu Restaurant? That's not cheap.

446
00:20:46,280 --> 00:20:47,161
Exactly.

447
00:20:47,721 --> 00:20:49,600
Look at how well they're living now.

448
00:20:49,760 --> 00:20:51,520
Why would she reconnect with my parents?

449
00:20:52,001 --> 00:20:53,320
If it were me, I wouldn't either.

450
00:20:55,120 --> 00:20:55,560
You know,

451
00:20:55,560 --> 00:20:57,600
her little brother is
actually pretty handsome.

452
00:20:57,620 --> 00:20:58,760
Almost as good-looking as me.

453
00:21:01,120 --> 00:21:02,961
I should send Zhidong some money.

454
00:21:03,441 --> 00:21:04,600
Why are you sending him money?

455
00:21:04,681 --> 00:21:06,441
It's his birthday too!

456
00:21:41,001 --> 00:21:41,800
Dacheng.

457
00:21:42,520 --> 00:21:43,320
Dacheng, here.

458
00:21:43,760 --> 00:21:45,001
Take this with you.

459
00:21:45,201 --> 00:21:45,961
Here, take it.

460
00:21:45,961 --> 00:21:46,600
Okay.

461
00:21:47,520 --> 00:21:48,320
All set.

462
00:21:49,520 --> 00:21:50,280
Let's go.

463
00:21:50,280 --> 00:21:50,600
Go.

464
00:21:50,600 --> 00:21:51,280
Alright.

465
00:21:54,881 --> 00:21:56,161
Xu.

466
00:21:56,881 --> 00:21:58,560
Mrs. Xu, heading out again?

467
00:21:58,921 --> 00:22:00,001
Yeah, that's right.

468
00:22:00,360 --> 00:22:01,320
Doing laundry?

469
00:22:01,401 --> 00:22:02,481
Yep, washing clothes.

470
00:22:11,441 --> 00:22:13,360
Once there's a daughter,
the son's forgotten.

471
00:22:31,320 --> 00:22:32,120
Morning.

472
00:22:32,881 --> 00:22:33,681
Morning.

473
00:22:54,560 --> 00:22:55,360
Shen.

474
00:22:59,360 --> 00:23:00,800
That family is here again.

475
00:23:03,481 --> 00:23:04,280
We're here.

476
00:23:05,401 --> 00:23:06,280
Here we are.

477
00:23:11,520 --> 00:23:12,441
Bring the cake.

478
00:23:13,481 --> 00:23:14,560
What's going on now?

479
00:23:15,001 --> 00:23:16,600
The whole family is coming this time?

480
00:23:17,360 --> 00:23:18,800
You just won't stop, will you?

481
00:23:19,080 --> 00:23:19,520
I...

482
00:23:19,520 --> 00:23:20,560
Hey, Dacheng.

483
00:23:21,161 --> 00:23:22,080
And you are?

484
00:23:22,080 --> 00:23:23,921
I'm Shen Mingzhu's father.

485
00:23:24,040 --> 00:23:25,441
My name's Shen Shengli.

486
00:23:27,401 --> 00:23:28,280
Mr. Shen.

487
00:23:28,401 --> 00:23:29,241
No need to be formal.

488
00:23:30,600 --> 00:23:31,401
Zhilu is...

489
00:23:32,161 --> 00:23:32,961
Zhilu?

490
00:23:34,040 --> 00:23:35,360
It's Mingzhu.

491
00:23:35,481 --> 00:23:37,040
Yes. Her name is Mingzhu.

492
00:23:37,040 --> 00:23:38,481
Was Mingzhu

493
00:23:39,001 --> 00:23:40,441
a child you brought home

494
00:23:40,840 --> 00:23:43,840
from Yujia Town Hospital?

495
00:23:47,320 --> 00:23:48,120
Was it

496
00:23:48,280 --> 00:23:50,201
an old lady

497
00:23:50,840 --> 00:23:52,921
who handed the little girl over to you?

498
00:23:53,241 --> 00:23:54,201
That little girl of mine

499
00:23:54,201 --> 00:23:56,881
has a twin brother.

500
00:23:59,681 --> 00:24:01,360
Mr. Shen!

501
00:24:02,760 --> 00:24:03,520
Alright, alright!

502
00:24:03,520 --> 00:24:04,721
Stop crying outside our door.

503
00:24:04,721 --> 00:24:05,760
What's going on, Mom?

504
00:24:06,641 --> 00:24:07,980
That family's here again.

505
00:24:07,980 --> 00:24:10,001
- That old lady was my mom
- Why are they here again?

506
00:24:10,001 --> 00:24:10,681
Exactly.

507
00:24:10,961 --> 00:24:12,080
I'll go kick them out.

508
00:24:12,120 --> 00:24:13,520
No, wait.

509
00:24:13,961 --> 00:24:15,560
Let's see what they're doing first.

510
00:24:15,760 --> 00:24:17,360
Has your sister woken up?

511
00:24:17,441 --> 00:24:18,241
Not yet.

512
00:24:18,241 --> 00:24:19,100
Keep your voice down.

513
00:24:19,760 --> 00:24:21,760
I'm her father too. Her real father.

514
00:24:21,760 --> 00:24:22,800
So what?

515
00:24:23,961 --> 00:24:25,280
When the child was just born,

516
00:24:25,401 --> 00:24:26,881
you gave her away.

517
00:24:26,881 --> 00:24:27,401
No...

518
00:24:27,401 --> 00:24:28,721
Now that she's grown up,

519
00:24:28,721 --> 00:24:29,721
you want her back?

520
00:24:29,721 --> 00:24:30,520
No...

521
00:24:30,580 --> 00:24:31,481
To be your caretaker?

522
00:24:31,481 --> 00:24:32,080
No.

523
00:24:32,080 --> 00:24:33,520
Aren't you asking too much?

524
00:24:34,080 --> 00:24:35,681
She'll care for whoever raised her!

525
00:24:35,681 --> 00:24:36,280
Yes, yes.

526
00:24:36,280 --> 00:24:38,320
You can't just
grab some kid off the street,

527
00:24:38,681 --> 00:24:39,641
say she's yours,

528
00:24:39,641 --> 00:24:41,080
and take her home, right?

529
00:24:41,080 --> 00:24:41,401
No.

530
00:24:41,401 --> 00:24:43,080
Are you out of your mind?

531
00:24:43,241 --> 00:24:44,161
What are you doing?

532
00:24:44,201 --> 00:24:46,040
What am I doing? You tell me!

533
00:24:46,040 --> 00:24:48,001
No, Mr. Shen, hear me out.

534
00:24:48,001 --> 00:24:49,961
Please, don't take this the wrong way.

535
00:24:49,961 --> 00:24:52,001
We didn't mean it like that!

536
00:24:52,001 --> 00:24:53,241
Then what did you mean?

537
00:24:54,040 --> 00:24:54,921
You're making a scene.

538
00:24:54,921 --> 00:24:57,320
We just...

539
00:24:58,001 --> 00:25:00,401
Yesterday was her birthday.

540
00:25:00,681 --> 00:25:02,560
We bought a cake for the child.

541
00:25:02,560 --> 00:25:04,280
The most expensive one we could find.

542
00:25:04,280 --> 00:25:05,721
It's really the best.

543
00:25:05,721 --> 00:25:07,241
What, you think we can't afford a cake?

544
00:25:07,840 --> 00:25:08,201
No...

545
00:25:08,201 --> 00:25:09,800
You think we can't celebrate a birthday?

546
00:25:09,800 --> 00:25:10,721
Of course you can.

547
00:25:10,760 --> 00:25:13,280
Yesterday was her birthday,
and today you brought a cake.

548
00:25:13,280 --> 00:25:14,600
What's that supposed to mean?

549
00:25:14,721 --> 00:25:16,681
Trying to make her
age faster or what?

550
00:25:16,681 --> 00:25:19,201
We just wanted to show
a little love for the child.

551
00:25:19,520 --> 00:25:20,320
Mr. Shen.

552
00:25:20,881 --> 00:25:22,721
Can we please have a calm talk?

553
00:25:23,040 --> 00:25:23,560
Dacheng.

554
00:25:23,560 --> 00:25:25,161
Haven't I already been calm?

555
00:25:25,360 --> 00:25:26,881
What kind of "calm talk" do you want?

556
00:25:27,921 --> 00:25:29,681
What if I don't
want to talk to you at all?

557
00:25:29,681 --> 00:25:30,681
Mr. Shen, please.

558
00:25:30,681 --> 00:25:32,441
If we can talk properly, we will.

559
00:25:32,441 --> 00:25:33,360
If not,

560
00:25:33,360 --> 00:25:35,120
we'll come here every day until we do.

561
00:25:35,120 --> 00:25:36,280
Every day?

562
00:25:36,881 --> 00:25:38,750
So you just want to keep bothering me?

563
00:25:38,760 --> 00:25:39,340
- No!
- Is that so?

564
00:25:39,350 --> 00:25:39,760
Mr. Shen.

565
00:25:39,760 --> 00:25:40,840
Looking for a fight, huh?

566
00:25:41,481 --> 00:25:42,441
You want to throw down?

567
00:25:42,441 --> 00:25:42,921
Dacheng!

568
00:25:42,961 --> 00:25:43,681
Listen to me!

569
00:25:43,681 --> 00:25:44,950
- All of you, back inside!
- Don't...

570
00:25:45,280 --> 00:25:46,241
Keep an eye on things.

571
00:25:46,241 --> 00:25:47,881
We can't all go down together.

572
00:25:47,881 --> 00:25:48,600
Dacheng, take this.

573
00:25:48,600 --> 00:25:49,881
Watch out, don't get blood on yourself.

574
00:25:49,881 --> 00:25:51,280
Come on, let's step aside and talk.

575
00:25:51,280 --> 00:25:51,961
Dacheng!

576
00:25:51,961 --> 00:25:53,481
- You stay there!
- Step aside, huh?

577
00:25:53,481 --> 00:25:54,881
- Mr. Shen...
- Stay put.

578
00:25:55,320 --> 00:25:56,320
She is my wife!

579
00:25:57,280 --> 00:25:59,441
I told them to stay put!

580
00:26:02,800 --> 00:26:04,080
No, Dacheng.

581
00:26:20,441 --> 00:26:22,401
Come on then.
What do you want to do?

582
00:26:23,441 --> 00:26:24,241
Mr. Shen.

583
00:26:25,320 --> 00:26:27,320
I want to thank you and your wife

584
00:26:27,441 --> 00:26:29,001
for raising the girl so well.

585
00:26:29,800 --> 00:26:31,080
Let me bow to you.

586
00:26:38,760 --> 00:26:40,560
It's soft words
after the hard ones, huh?

587
00:26:40,560 --> 00:26:42,280
Trying to soften me up?

588
00:26:43,241 --> 00:26:44,241
I, Shen Shengli,

589
00:26:44,241 --> 00:26:46,520
don't buy into this trick.

590
00:26:46,520 --> 00:26:47,681
Get up, get up!

591
00:26:47,681 --> 00:26:49,520
Come on, you're a grown man,
what's this for?

592
00:26:50,481 --> 00:26:51,881
Let me be straight with you.

593
00:26:52,040 --> 00:26:54,520
We didn't come here looking for trouble.

594
00:26:55,040 --> 00:26:56,080
All these years,

595
00:26:56,360 --> 00:26:57,961
we've felt guilty toward our daughter.

596
00:26:58,120 --> 00:26:58,520
I...

597
00:26:59,721 --> 00:27:01,360
Please accept our token of appreciation.

598
00:27:01,360 --> 00:27:02,080
Take it back.

599
00:27:02,881 --> 00:27:03,950
What's the meaning of this?

600
00:27:05,080 --> 00:27:07,120
We've raised Mingzhu
like our own daughter.

601
00:27:07,560 --> 00:27:09,040
And you hand me this?

602
00:27:09,120 --> 00:27:10,560
What do you take us for?

603
00:27:11,241 --> 00:27:12,721
You've got it wrong, buddy.

604
00:27:13,241 --> 00:27:14,560
This bit of money is nothing

605
00:27:14,760 --> 00:27:16,320
compared to the kindness

606
00:27:16,320 --> 00:27:17,840
you've shown in raising her.

607
00:27:18,481 --> 00:27:20,401
When we heard
about the girl's situation,

608
00:27:20,401 --> 00:27:22,921
we were so worried,
but we couldn't help.

609
00:27:23,040 --> 00:27:24,441
She won't reconnect with us.

610
00:27:24,481 --> 00:27:25,760
We are strangers to her.

611
00:27:26,001 --> 00:27:27,600
We can't give this to her.

612
00:27:28,320 --> 00:27:29,560
This is for the girl,

613
00:27:29,560 --> 00:27:31,241
maybe it'll help her a little.

614
00:27:32,961 --> 00:27:33,840
Please.

615
00:27:34,840 --> 00:27:36,560
You think money can buy back

616
00:27:36,560 --> 00:27:38,161
thirty years of time?

617
00:27:40,360 --> 00:27:41,120
No, it never can.

618
00:27:42,520 --> 00:27:43,080
Never.

619
00:28:00,921 --> 00:28:01,940
Here, I've got a lighter.

620
00:28:02,161 --> 00:28:03,641
Pal, let me light it for you.

621
00:28:06,080 --> 00:28:07,600
Thanks.

622
00:28:13,641 --> 00:28:14,681
Thirty years went by

623
00:28:15,921 --> 00:28:17,401
in the blink of an eye.

624
00:28:19,961 --> 00:28:22,241
I knew sooner or later
you'd come to us.

625
00:28:25,600 --> 00:28:27,241
This thing called blood ties,

626
00:28:27,760 --> 00:28:28,800
there's no controlling it.

627
00:28:29,441 --> 00:28:30,241
That's right.

628
00:28:30,921 --> 00:28:32,201
Blood ties

629
00:28:32,800 --> 00:28:33,600
are impossible

630
00:28:34,481 --> 00:28:35,441
to change.

631
00:28:40,681 --> 00:28:42,150
If she decides to reconnect with you,

632
00:28:42,481 --> 00:28:43,600
we can't stop her.

633
00:28:44,280 --> 00:28:45,641
If she doesn't want to,

634
00:28:46,161 --> 00:28:47,481
then there's nothing we can do.

635
00:28:47,481 --> 00:28:48,280
Right.

636
00:28:49,001 --> 00:28:50,080
This is something

637
00:28:50,600 --> 00:28:53,080
that someday,
you'll have to give her yourselves.

638
00:28:54,681 --> 00:28:55,481
Pal.

639
00:28:58,520 --> 00:28:59,320
Pal.

640
00:29:00,120 --> 00:29:03,120
We both treat Shen Mingzhu
like our own daughter, don't we?

641
00:29:03,161 --> 00:29:04,001
Of course.

642
00:29:04,600 --> 00:29:06,040
The girl's in serious trouble now.

643
00:29:06,040 --> 00:29:07,161
You both know that.

644
00:29:08,320 --> 00:29:09,241
Don't rush it.

645
00:29:10,520 --> 00:29:12,520
Take it slow. Give her some time.

646
00:29:15,040 --> 00:29:16,040
Hearing you say that

647
00:29:16,520 --> 00:29:17,921
puts my mind at ease.

648
00:29:21,560 --> 00:29:23,560
My mother-in-law really has
a good eye for people.

649
00:29:23,600 --> 00:29:25,080
You and your wife are

650
00:29:25,080 --> 00:29:25,881
great people.

651
00:29:26,080 --> 00:29:27,241
Honestly,

652
00:29:27,641 --> 00:29:29,441
Shen Mingzhu is my wife's whole world.

653
00:29:29,800 --> 00:29:31,280
She's terrified of losing Mingzhu.

654
00:29:31,280 --> 00:29:31,921
I understand.

655
00:29:31,921 --> 00:29:33,600
Anyway, we're on the same page now.

656
00:29:33,600 --> 00:29:35,641
From now on,
both families will look after her.

657
00:29:35,760 --> 00:29:36,641
Shen Mingzhu will be

658
00:29:36,641 --> 00:29:38,441
the precious gem
of both our families.

659
00:29:38,441 --> 00:29:39,320
Listen,

660
00:29:39,460 --> 00:29:40,800
when it comes to women's matters,

661
00:29:41,201 --> 00:29:43,080
you've got to
work on their mindset slowly.

662
00:29:43,120 --> 00:29:44,520
Got it, understood.

663
00:29:44,760 --> 00:29:45,961
Alright.

664
00:29:49,460 --> 00:29:50,760
- Mr. Shen.
- Give me the clothes.

665
00:29:50,760 --> 00:29:51,481
Um...

666
00:29:51,721 --> 00:29:52,681
But the cake...

667
00:29:52,681 --> 00:29:53,560
Give me the clothes.

668
00:29:54,001 --> 00:29:54,800
But the cake...

669
00:29:54,800 --> 00:29:55,840
Take it back.

670
00:29:56,040 --> 00:29:56,840
No...

671
00:29:56,860 --> 00:29:58,220
Get on the bike. We're going home!

672
00:30:00,961 --> 00:30:01,760
Get on.

673
00:30:25,360 --> 00:30:25,921
Dad.

674
00:30:27,840 --> 00:30:28,520
Yeah?

675
00:30:29,201 --> 00:30:30,520
You didn't start a fight, right?

676
00:30:31,201 --> 00:30:32,921
What for?

677
00:30:33,320 --> 00:30:34,241
They were in the wrong.

678
00:30:34,721 --> 00:30:35,881
I chased them off.

679
00:30:36,520 --> 00:30:37,600
See? I told you.

680
00:30:37,721 --> 00:30:39,360
The righteous shouldn't be afraid.

681
00:30:40,080 --> 00:30:41,460
I worried you'd get beaten up.

682
00:30:41,460 --> 00:30:42,560
Did you see how big he was?

683
00:30:42,560 --> 00:30:43,800
Why would I lose to him?

684
00:30:44,161 --> 00:30:45,441
Back in my troupe, I was...

685
00:30:45,441 --> 00:30:47,840
I had some skill, you know.

686
00:30:48,161 --> 00:30:49,520
If he dares come again,

687
00:30:49,520 --> 00:30:50,800
I'll hit him again.

688
00:30:50,881 --> 00:30:52,481
If I really get physical...

689
00:30:52,840 --> 00:30:55,320
No. Why would he come back again?

690
00:30:57,080 --> 00:30:59,280
Are they coming back
every now and then?

691
00:30:59,600 --> 00:31:01,001
But didn't you kick them out?

692
00:31:01,001 --> 00:31:02,120
Isn't it all settled?

693
00:31:02,241 --> 00:31:03,040
Hold on.

694
00:31:03,241 --> 00:31:06,120
Think about it. He's a grown man.

695
00:31:06,120 --> 00:31:08,080
If he wants to come,
can I really stop him?

696
00:31:08,080 --> 00:31:08,721
Mingzhu...

697
00:31:08,721 --> 00:31:10,800
Why are you all standing here
early in the morning?

698
00:31:12,080 --> 00:31:14,441
I was discussing with your mom

699
00:31:14,641 --> 00:31:17,241
about what noodles
I should make for you.

700
00:31:19,600 --> 00:31:20,881
Enough with the noodles.

701
00:31:20,881 --> 00:31:22,481
Just be honest with her.

702
00:31:25,280 --> 00:31:26,080
What's up?

703
00:31:28,401 --> 00:31:30,320
Well, your parents...

704
00:31:30,520 --> 00:31:32,441
What parents?
What are you talking about?

705
00:31:34,881 --> 00:31:35,881
Your biological parents.

706
00:31:36,681 --> 00:31:38,360
The parents who abandoned you.

707
00:31:39,040 --> 00:31:39,881
They came here again.

708
00:31:47,961 --> 00:31:49,080
Let them come, then.

709
00:31:49,800 --> 00:31:51,360
We'll mind our own business.

710
00:31:52,560 --> 00:31:53,360
Come on, Mom.

711
00:31:53,520 --> 00:31:54,120
Yeah.

712
00:31:54,641 --> 00:31:55,800
Look at my girl.

713
00:31:56,120 --> 00:31:58,921
Blood ties don't beat
the ones who raised you.

714
00:31:58,921 --> 00:31:59,800
I'm telling you.

715
00:32:01,401 --> 00:32:03,201
I knew my girl had good sense.

716
00:32:04,800 --> 00:32:05,280
Here.

717
00:32:10,721 --> 00:32:12,161
Pickled greens.

718
00:32:12,201 --> 00:32:13,040
Don't spill them.

719
00:32:13,600 --> 00:32:15,441
Here, Zhixia.

720
00:32:18,441 --> 00:32:19,600
Shouldn't they be cold by now?

721
00:32:21,721 --> 00:32:22,520
They're fine.

722
00:32:25,921 --> 00:32:27,401
Here, Mom. Have a bun.

723
00:32:27,840 --> 00:32:28,760
I'll have a youtiao.

724
00:32:28,760 --> 00:32:30,161
Dad, you eat.

725
00:32:31,401 --> 00:32:32,001
Here.

726
00:32:32,401 --> 00:32:33,201
Thanks, Zhixia.

727
00:32:33,360 --> 00:32:34,600
Freshly steamed this morning.

728
00:32:35,280 --> 00:32:36,961
Try the filling. See how it is.

729
00:32:40,120 --> 00:32:41,161
This bun smells great.

730
00:32:48,001 --> 00:32:48,800
Mingzhu.

731
00:32:52,560 --> 00:32:53,921
You're an adult now.

732
00:32:55,401 --> 00:32:57,040
A lot has happened in the past.

733
00:32:59,520 --> 00:33:00,360
There are things...

734
00:33:02,961 --> 00:33:04,320
you have to figure out yourself.

735
00:33:11,001 --> 00:33:13,921
I only have one Dad and one Mom.

736
00:33:15,161 --> 00:33:16,120
And that's you.

737
00:33:21,241 --> 00:33:22,721
You'd better not abandon me.

738
00:33:25,320 --> 00:33:26,681
One Dad, one Mom.

739
00:33:27,420 --> 00:33:28,481
And what about me, Zhixia?

740
00:33:29,241 --> 00:33:30,520
I almost forgot you.

741
00:33:30,921 --> 00:33:32,280
And the best little brother too.

742
00:33:32,840 --> 00:33:33,881
That's more like it.

743
00:33:44,760 --> 00:33:46,001
Mother.

744
00:33:47,360 --> 00:33:48,921
From today on,

745
00:33:49,280 --> 00:33:51,921
let's call a halt
to the grudge between us.

746
00:33:53,241 --> 00:33:55,320
I never expected that

747
00:33:55,641 --> 00:33:58,001
the family
you found for that little girl

748
00:33:58,320 --> 00:34:00,001
is remarkable.

749
00:34:00,080 --> 00:34:02,161
They've raised that little girl

750
00:34:02,201 --> 00:34:03,320
so wonderfully well.

751
00:34:03,320 --> 00:34:05,520
She's even better off than our own kids.

752
00:34:05,520 --> 00:34:06,161
That's true.

753
00:34:07,481 --> 00:34:08,361
Now,

754
00:34:08,801 --> 00:34:11,200
I've put the connection
in place with them.

755
00:34:13,401 --> 00:34:15,560
A bond will grow in time.

756
00:34:15,680 --> 00:34:17,080
There's plenty of time ahead.

757
00:34:19,120 --> 00:34:20,600
Alright, Mom.

758
00:34:21,441 --> 00:34:22,600
As you rest in peace,

759
00:34:22,881 --> 00:34:25,200
bless Zhilu so she'll be safe and sound.

760
00:34:25,441 --> 00:34:26,961
Superstition.

761
00:34:27,720 --> 00:34:29,481
While you're at it,

762
00:34:29,520 --> 00:34:32,401
bless Zhixia and Zhidong
to be safe and sound too.

763
00:34:32,401 --> 00:34:33,321
Yes.

764
00:34:34,240 --> 00:34:36,240
Okay, let's all bow three times.

765
00:34:37,640 --> 00:34:38,481
One bow.

766
00:34:39,490 --> 00:34:41,001
- Second bow.
- My joss stick isn't lit.

767
00:34:41,001 --> 00:34:41,560
That won't work.

768
00:34:41,560 --> 00:34:42,520
Third bow. Done.

769
00:34:48,680 --> 00:34:49,520
Have a seat.

770
00:34:55,441 --> 00:34:56,401
Today

771
00:34:57,040 --> 00:34:59,680
is a good day for our family.

772
00:34:59,680 --> 00:35:01,080
Yes, a good day.

773
00:35:01,761 --> 00:35:02,921
I never expected

774
00:35:02,921 --> 00:35:06,520
the Shen family
to be so magnanimous.

775
00:35:06,520 --> 00:35:09,321
I couldn't agree more.

776
00:35:10,160 --> 00:35:11,281
Zhidong, Zhixia,

777
00:35:11,841 --> 00:35:12,600
from now on,

778
00:35:12,600 --> 00:35:15,761
you should repay
the kindness they've shown.

779
00:35:15,961 --> 00:35:16,640
Right?

780
00:35:16,640 --> 00:35:17,281
Indeed.

781
00:35:17,281 --> 00:35:18,240
Okay, Mom.

782
00:35:21,040 --> 00:35:22,801
It's only right to support your parents.

783
00:35:23,200 --> 00:35:24,881
But they raised your daughter,

784
00:35:24,881 --> 00:35:27,481
and now you expect
your kids to repay them?

785
00:35:28,200 --> 00:35:29,441
That makes very little sense.

786
00:35:29,550 --> 00:35:30,700
- Of course...
- Xu Zhidong,

787
00:35:30,880 --> 00:35:32,560
if you promised,
then you're responsible.

788
00:35:32,560 --> 00:35:33,200
Alright?

789
00:35:33,200 --> 00:35:34,120
Tomorrow,

790
00:35:34,120 --> 00:35:36,640
bring gifts to show your gratitude.

791
00:35:36,921 --> 00:35:37,761
Gifts?

792
00:35:37,761 --> 00:35:38,801
Buy gifts?

793
00:35:39,000 --> 00:35:39,761
I don't have money.

794
00:35:39,761 --> 00:35:40,720
Mom, I'm broke.

795
00:35:40,720 --> 00:35:41,841
Wait a second.

796
00:35:41,841 --> 00:35:43,040
Let's not jump into that yet.

797
00:35:44,560 --> 00:35:46,600
Zhixia, how could you...

798
00:35:47,281 --> 00:35:49,120
What kind of attitude is that?

799
00:35:49,761 --> 00:35:51,921
Your dad put it beautifully.

800
00:35:52,200 --> 00:35:55,120
Today's a big day for our family.

801
00:35:55,441 --> 00:35:56,240
Right?

802
00:35:56,321 --> 00:35:58,080
The Shen family has been so good to us.

803
00:35:58,740 --> 00:36:00,401
They have been
generous and understanding.

804
00:36:00,481 --> 00:36:01,640
They raised your sister

805
00:36:01,841 --> 00:36:04,281
from a tiny baby
to the woman she is now.

806
00:36:04,281 --> 00:36:05,600
And they did such a fine job.

807
00:36:05,961 --> 00:36:08,600
Shouldn't we be grateful to them?

808
00:36:08,720 --> 00:36:11,401
Buying a gift is the least we can do.

809
00:36:11,600 --> 00:36:12,361
Right?

810
00:36:12,361 --> 00:36:13,560
Zhixia,

811
00:36:14,160 --> 00:36:15,281
you should treat them

812
00:36:15,281 --> 00:36:17,640
like your own parents
and take care of them.

813
00:36:17,680 --> 00:36:19,560
You're the eldest sister.

814
00:36:19,560 --> 00:36:21,720
You should set an example.

815
00:36:21,801 --> 00:36:24,600
You need to play a role model.

816
00:36:24,600 --> 00:36:24,961
Right, Zhixia?

817
00:36:24,961 --> 00:36:25,720
Am I wrong?

818
00:36:25,720 --> 00:36:26,281
You can buy the gift.

819
00:36:26,281 --> 00:36:26,961
You're starting

820
00:36:26,961 --> 00:36:28,820
to sound more and more
like my mother-in-law.

821
00:36:29,080 --> 00:36:31,160
You turn everything
into some grand lecture.

822
00:36:31,281 --> 00:36:33,441
Why should I be
the role model you want?

823
00:36:33,441 --> 00:36:35,441
Just because I'm the eldest?

824
00:36:35,441 --> 00:36:36,281
Why me?

825
00:36:36,281 --> 00:36:37,361
Why should I suffer?

826
00:36:37,361 --> 00:36:39,240
Just because I'm the oldest,
I have to suffer?

827
00:36:40,680 --> 00:36:42,401
Alright, fine.

828
00:36:42,401 --> 00:36:44,600
I can't argue with you.

829
00:36:44,600 --> 00:36:45,321
You win.

830
00:36:45,321 --> 00:36:46,520
Just go home.

831
00:36:46,520 --> 00:36:47,560
Go back to your own home.

832
00:36:47,560 --> 00:36:49,401
I really can't count on her.

833
00:36:49,841 --> 00:36:51,961
Fine, I'll leave. Okay?

834
00:36:52,560 --> 00:36:53,881
You find me disappointing?

835
00:36:53,881 --> 00:36:55,841
Then don't expect
anything from me ever again.

836
00:36:55,841 --> 00:36:57,001
Count on your precious son.

837
00:36:57,001 --> 00:36:58,441
Count on that daughter

838
00:36:58,441 --> 00:36:59,600
who turned out better than us.

839
00:37:00,361 --> 00:37:01,160
Zhixia!

840
00:37:01,680 --> 00:37:03,160
"Be a role model," really?

841
00:37:03,160 --> 00:37:04,600
What are you people even thinking?

842
00:37:04,600 --> 00:37:05,680
You're too worked up.

843
00:37:05,680 --> 00:37:07,040
A mother shouldn't have said that.

844
00:37:07,040 --> 00:37:07,801
I just...

845
00:37:08,321 --> 00:37:09,640
Zhixia's pregnant!

846
00:37:09,640 --> 00:37:10,281
But...

847
00:37:10,281 --> 00:37:11,001
Zhixia!

848
00:37:11,001 --> 00:37:13,441
- I know she's pregnant!
- Zhixia!

849
00:37:13,720 --> 00:37:15,841
Women get pregnant and have babies.

850
00:37:15,841 --> 00:37:17,881
It's it how it's supposed to be.

851
00:37:18,160 --> 00:37:19,481
What's the big deal?

852
00:37:19,841 --> 00:37:20,640
Zhixia!

853
00:37:34,040 --> 00:37:34,841
Chen.

854
00:37:35,040 --> 00:37:35,841
Dong.

855
00:37:36,080 --> 00:37:38,001
I heard my parents arguing inside.

856
00:37:38,001 --> 00:37:40,190
They were asking why you haven't
discussed marriage with us.

857
00:37:40,200 --> 00:37:41,321
It's that bad?

858
00:37:42,881 --> 00:37:44,160
My parents have been busy

859
00:37:44,160 --> 00:37:46,080
trying to reconnect
with my second sister.

860
00:37:46,361 --> 00:37:47,841
But that didn't work out,

861
00:37:48,281 --> 00:37:49,761
and now they are losing Zhixia too.

862
00:37:51,361 --> 00:37:52,560
Zhixia, slow down!

863
00:37:52,560 --> 00:37:54,001
Slow down! Take it easy!

864
00:37:54,321 --> 00:37:56,040
Why are you walking so fast?

865
00:37:56,040 --> 00:37:57,481
Didn't you all tell me to leave?

866
00:37:57,481 --> 00:37:58,040
I didn't...

867
00:37:58,040 --> 00:38:00,160
Look at your mom, just look at her.

868
00:38:00,520 --> 00:38:02,200
Put this on.

869
00:38:02,600 --> 00:38:03,961
Even if you're mad,

870
00:38:03,961 --> 00:38:05,120
keep yourself warm.

871
00:38:05,120 --> 00:38:06,560
What if you catch a cold?

872
00:38:11,080 --> 00:38:13,080
You're my child. I...

873
00:38:13,120 --> 00:38:15,441
Can't I scold you a little?

874
00:38:16,160 --> 00:38:17,321
You gave birth to me,

875
00:38:17,961 --> 00:38:19,881
so you should've raised me.

876
00:38:19,961 --> 00:38:21,120
Being my mom doesn't give you

877
00:38:21,120 --> 00:38:22,560
the right to do whatever you want.

878
00:38:23,881 --> 00:38:25,560
She's absolutely right.

879
00:38:25,640 --> 00:38:26,441
Zhixia,

880
00:38:26,761 --> 00:38:28,921
your mom and I haven't
been thinking straight.

881
00:38:28,921 --> 00:38:30,001
We're confused.

882
00:38:30,240 --> 00:38:31,720
Don't take it to heart, okay?

883
00:38:33,441 --> 00:38:34,240
Let go.

884
00:38:34,240 --> 00:38:35,001
No.

885
00:38:35,160 --> 00:38:37,001
Let go. I'm getting my stuff.

886
00:38:37,321 --> 00:38:38,120
Let go of her.

887
00:38:39,200 --> 00:38:41,680
The doctor prescribed this
to help you sleep better.

888
00:38:42,361 --> 00:38:43,961
You'd better start being nicer to me.

889
00:38:43,961 --> 00:38:44,680
I...

890
00:38:45,240 --> 00:38:46,080
And to you too.

891
00:38:52,200 --> 00:38:53,200
That girl

892
00:38:54,160 --> 00:38:55,600
always has something sharp to say.

893
00:38:56,361 --> 00:38:57,160
But still...

894
00:38:59,281 --> 00:39:01,361
She's my sweet little baby.

895
00:39:02,961 --> 00:39:04,200
That's what being family means.

896
00:39:04,680 --> 00:39:06,321
Nothing can take us apart.

897
00:39:06,321 --> 00:39:07,001
Yeah.

898
00:39:09,240 --> 00:39:13,001
Raising this girl was truly worth it.

899
00:39:14,761 --> 00:39:15,650
She's calmed down now.

900
00:39:20,281 --> 00:39:21,801
Chen just called.

901
00:39:21,881 --> 00:39:23,560
Her parents weren't too happy.

902
00:39:23,760 --> 00:39:24,720
Honestly, that's on me.

903
00:39:24,720 --> 00:39:26,200
We've been together for a while now,

904
00:39:26,200 --> 00:39:27,640
but the two families haven't met yet.

905
00:39:27,841 --> 00:39:28,640
Maybe you and Dad

906
00:39:28,720 --> 00:39:30,600
should find a time to meet her parents.

907
00:39:33,520 --> 00:39:36,080
We really should meet them.

908
00:39:36,441 --> 00:39:38,720
But with everything
that's been going on lately

909
00:39:39,080 --> 00:39:40,080
in our family,

910
00:39:40,200 --> 00:39:42,520
maybe we should wait a bit.

911
00:39:42,520 --> 00:39:43,060
Alright?

912
00:39:43,060 --> 00:39:44,921
It's not something
that can be rushed anyway.

913
00:39:44,921 --> 00:39:45,720
- Yeah.
- Let's talk later.

914
00:39:45,720 --> 00:39:46,401
Yes.

915
00:39:46,401 --> 00:39:47,240
No need to rush.

916
00:39:47,240 --> 00:39:47,881
Yeah, take it easy.

917
00:39:47,881 --> 00:39:48,680
Be patient.

918
00:39:48,801 --> 00:39:50,080
Easy for you to say.

919
00:39:50,080 --> 00:39:51,350
I'm the one getting anxious here.

920
00:39:51,600 --> 00:39:53,761
Are you neglecting your own children

921
00:39:53,761 --> 00:39:55,120
for my long-lost sister?

922
00:40:04,120 --> 00:40:04,921
Mingzhu.

923
00:40:05,200 --> 00:40:07,441
Meiqi, what brings you here?

924
00:40:08,200 --> 00:40:08,841
Yeah.

925
00:40:10,080 --> 00:40:11,281
Have you had lunch yet?

926
00:40:11,281 --> 00:40:12,441
Yeah, I already ate.

927
00:40:13,321 --> 00:40:14,120
Um…

928
00:40:14,841 --> 00:40:16,761
My mom said
you haven't had bird's nest in days,

929
00:40:16,761 --> 00:40:18,100
so she asked me to bring you some.

930
00:40:18,120 --> 00:40:19,841
It's a special meal for pregnant women,

931
00:40:19,881 --> 00:40:21,160
all prepared and ready for you.

932
00:40:22,040 --> 00:40:24,040
Tell your mom
she really doesn't have to do this.

933
00:40:24,321 --> 00:40:26,560
My appetite's been great lately.
I can eat anything.

934
00:40:28,410 --> 00:40:29,761
Sit down. I'll get you some water.

935
00:40:29,761 --> 00:40:31,600
No, it's alright.

936
00:40:32,921 --> 00:40:33,720
Uh…

937
00:40:34,841 --> 00:40:36,120
Your parents aren't home?

938
00:40:36,281 --> 00:40:37,921
They're upstairs taking a nap.

939
00:40:41,520 --> 00:40:42,321
Mingzhu.

940
00:40:44,761 --> 00:40:46,001
I'd like to know

941
00:40:47,321 --> 00:40:48,841
if you'd be willing
to move back in.

942
00:40:50,921 --> 00:40:52,240
My brother's gone,

943
00:40:52,921 --> 00:40:54,560
and my dad's hardly ever home.

944
00:40:55,080 --> 00:40:56,680
It's just Mom and me now.

945
00:40:56,680 --> 00:40:58,001
The house feels so empty.

946
00:40:59,961 --> 00:41:02,080
I just feel more at ease
staying at my own place.

947
00:41:03,040 --> 00:41:04,160
I'm on leave right now,

948
00:41:04,441 --> 00:41:06,160
so I can help my parents out a bit.

949
00:41:09,881 --> 00:41:11,560
Is this about

950
00:41:12,160 --> 00:41:13,240
the elevator card?

951
00:41:14,640 --> 00:41:15,881
I've seen death.

952
00:41:15,881 --> 00:41:17,881
You think I'd care
about something that trivial?

953
00:41:18,921 --> 00:41:20,520
Go talk to Mrs. Feng when you get home.

954
00:41:21,240 --> 00:41:22,961
We've all got to try and live well.

955
00:41:23,640 --> 00:41:25,200
Only then can Jianqi rest in peace.

956
00:41:25,921 --> 00:41:27,240
It's not the same, Mingzhu.

957
00:41:29,040 --> 00:41:30,801
My mom lost her son.

958
00:41:32,281 --> 00:41:33,281
But, you and my brother

959
00:41:34,540 --> 00:41:36,481
were only together
for a little over three years.

960
00:41:38,801 --> 00:41:40,640
What's that supposed to mean?

961
00:41:41,881 --> 00:41:43,801
Your brother was the father of my child.

962
00:41:43,961 --> 00:41:45,761
And you still haven't
decided to keep it.

963
00:41:49,720 --> 00:41:50,961
Are you here to bring tonics

964
00:41:50,961 --> 00:41:52,281
or to stir things up?

965
00:41:56,841 --> 00:41:57,640
Meiqi!

966
00:42:06,401 --> 00:42:07,200
What are you doing?

967
00:42:07,560 --> 00:42:09,040
My sister's your sister-in-law,

968
00:42:09,040 --> 00:42:10,600
and my nephew's your nephew.

969
00:42:10,881 --> 00:42:12,120
We're family.

970
00:42:12,120 --> 00:42:13,680
Stop acting like
you don't know us, okay?

971
00:42:13,680 --> 00:42:14,600
Who's family with you?

972
00:42:14,600 --> 00:42:16,640
Your sister might not even
have that baby. Move!

973
00:42:20,120 --> 00:42:22,361
Always acting so mean.

974
00:42:22,801 --> 00:42:24,281
Who'd ever marry you?

975
00:42:30,321 --> 00:42:31,160
Feng Meiqi.

976
00:42:33,361 --> 00:42:34,160
Well?

977
00:42:35,321 --> 00:42:36,680
Did she agree to keep the baby?

978
00:42:38,001 --> 00:42:38,640
No.
