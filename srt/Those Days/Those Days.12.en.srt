00:01:12,431 --> 00:01:14,800
(Adapted from iceread.com novel
"You Xi" by Qingyang Wanxi)

00:01:14,980 --> 00:01:17,980
=Episode 12=

4
00:01:19,880 --> 00:01:20,720
Meiqi.

5
00:01:21,240 --> 00:01:23,166
I bought a new charging cable.

6
00:01:23,190 --> 00:01:24,886
Here, try using this one.

7
00:01:24,910 --> 00:01:26,310
No, I have my own.

8
00:01:26,800 --> 00:01:28,086
This one's really good.

9
00:01:28,110 --> 00:01:29,590
You don't have to worry about me, Mom.

10
00:01:29,600 --> 00:01:30,640
I know.

11
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:32,390
Just look at you.

12
00:01:32,910 --> 00:01:33,750
Meiqi.

13
00:01:33,860 --> 00:01:35,350
You're only going to Shanghai
for a one-day interview.

14
00:01:35,360 --> 00:01:36,550
Why are you bringing so much?

15
00:01:37,270 --> 00:01:38,776
What could I possibly leave behind?

16
00:01:38,800 --> 00:01:42,270
Laptop, face mask, cleanser, pyjamas.

17
00:01:42,720 --> 00:01:44,246
No, about the pyjamas.

18
00:01:44,270 --> 00:01:45,750
Don't bring a whole set.

19
00:01:45,880 --> 00:01:47,936
A simple T-shirt will do.

20
00:01:47,960 --> 00:01:48,830
No, it won't.

21
00:01:49,720 --> 00:01:52,646
Meiqi has worn silk pyjamas
since she was little.

22
00:01:52,670 --> 00:01:54,006
She can't sleep without them.

23
00:01:54,030 --> 00:01:55,960
Exactly, Mom knows me best.

24
00:01:57,800 --> 00:01:59,080
Meiqi.

25
00:02:00,640 --> 00:02:02,310
At your last class reunion,

26
00:02:02,960 --> 00:02:04,750
I kept calling you.

27
00:02:05,550 --> 00:02:08,240
I was just too anxious.

28
00:02:09,550 --> 00:02:11,520
My fault. I'm sorry.

29
00:02:13,430 --> 00:02:14,270
Mom.

30
00:02:15,270 --> 00:02:16,110
It's my fault.

31
00:02:17,200 --> 00:02:18,800
I shouldn't have turned off my phone.

32
00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:22,566
It's because your brother
had an accident.

33
00:02:22,590 --> 00:02:25,200
Since then,
I've been anxious all the time.

34
00:02:25,360 --> 00:02:28,270
When I can't see you, I panic.

35
00:02:28,830 --> 00:02:30,960
I know it's unreasonable.

36
00:02:31,640 --> 00:02:34,110
Your dad and I
sent you to study in the UK.

37
00:02:34,390 --> 00:02:35,640
We wanted you

38
00:02:36,110 --> 00:02:38,246
to aim higher and go further.

39
00:02:38,270 --> 00:02:39,110
That's right.

40
00:02:39,360 --> 00:02:40,960
When you were studying in the UK,

41
00:02:41,590 --> 00:02:43,990
your mom couldn't sleep
for nights on end.

42
00:02:45,080 --> 00:02:46,550
You never told me that.

43
00:02:47,040 --> 00:02:48,126
If I had told you,

44
00:02:48,150 --> 00:02:49,850
how could you have focused
on your studies?

45
00:02:50,640 --> 00:02:53,126
But Meiqi, you know,
from the moment you boarded that plane,

46
00:02:53,150 --> 00:02:54,966
my phone never once

47
00:02:54,990 --> 00:02:56,390
was turned off.

48
00:02:56,710 --> 00:02:58,566
Every morning, the first thing I did

49
00:02:58,590 --> 00:03:00,480
was check your spending record.

50
00:03:00,710 --> 00:03:03,366
No, I wasn't spying on you, you know.

51
00:03:03,390 --> 00:03:05,056
It's just through those records,

52
00:03:05,080 --> 00:03:06,456
I could tell what you were doing.

53
00:03:06,480 --> 00:03:08,056
Whether you were safe.

54
00:03:08,080 --> 00:03:09,246
In the morning,

55
00:03:09,270 --> 00:03:10,360
I'd see a few transactions.

56
00:03:10,830 --> 00:03:13,056
I'd think, my daughter's bought coffee,

57
00:03:13,080 --> 00:03:14,406
had breakfast.

58
00:03:14,430 --> 00:03:15,406
By noon,

59
00:03:15,430 --> 00:03:16,126
those charges

60
00:03:16,150 --> 00:03:18,336
meant you'd gone out
with your classmates.

61
00:03:18,360 --> 00:03:19,296
And later on,

62
00:03:19,320 --> 00:03:20,846
I'd just feel reassured

63
00:03:20,870 --> 00:03:23,150
whenever I saw those records.

64
00:03:25,520 --> 00:03:26,760
This time in Shanghai,

65
00:03:27,320 --> 00:03:28,430
I promise

66
00:03:29,480 --> 00:03:31,640
I won't call you unnecessarily.

67
00:03:32,270 --> 00:03:33,806
But you have to promise me too.

68
00:03:33,830 --> 00:03:35,960
Don't turn off your phone, alright?

69
00:03:38,110 --> 00:03:39,240
I promise, Mom.

70
00:03:40,040 --> 00:03:41,200
- Alright.
- All good.

71
00:03:41,320 --> 00:03:42,320
Go on and finish packing.

72
00:03:42,520 --> 00:03:43,846
Yes, go on then.

73
00:03:43,870 --> 00:03:45,270
Tell me if you need anything.

74
00:04:06,870 --> 00:04:08,800
(A new chapter of life
is about to begin.)

75
00:04:13,550 --> 00:04:14,390
Meiqi.

76
00:04:16,960 --> 00:04:17,800
Simon?

77
00:04:18,120 --> 00:04:20,230
It really is you. What a coincidence.

78
00:04:20,660 --> 00:04:22,770
We haven't seen each other
since graduation, have we?

79
00:04:23,320 --> 00:04:25,030
Right. I went home a while ago.

80
00:04:25,270 --> 00:04:26,620
What about you? Why are you here?

81
00:04:26,760 --> 00:04:28,760
I work here. I'm a trainee lawyer.

82
00:04:28,960 --> 00:04:30,206
You work here?

83
00:04:30,230 --> 00:04:30,976
Yes.

84
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:31,840
And you?

85
00:04:32,030 --> 00:04:33,536
I'm here for an interview.

86
00:04:33,560 --> 00:04:34,400
What a coincidence.

87
00:04:35,440 --> 00:04:37,056
Let's have a meal together sometime.

88
00:04:37,080 --> 00:04:37,976
Sure.

89
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:40,096
But not today, I'm in a hurry.

90
00:04:40,120 --> 00:04:40,616
Alright.

91
00:04:40,640 --> 00:04:41,680
Yes.

92
00:04:42,110 --> 00:04:43,220
- Shall we go?
- Let's go.

93
00:04:43,230 --> 00:04:44,070
My goodness.

94
00:04:44,640 --> 00:04:46,520
Dinner. Such a coincidence.

95
00:04:46,530 --> 00:04:48,310
Right, we haven't
added each other on WeChat.

96
00:04:48,320 --> 00:04:49,470
Quick, add me.

97
00:04:54,350 --> 00:04:55,520
Oh no!

98
00:04:56,350 --> 00:04:57,096
What's wrong?

99
00:04:57,120 --> 00:04:58,056
Feng!

100
00:04:58,080 --> 00:04:59,126
My bracelet.

101
00:04:59,150 --> 00:05:00,446
I can't find my bracelet.

102
00:05:00,470 --> 00:05:00,976
Bracelet?

103
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:02,656
It's alright, I'll help you look later.

104
00:05:02,680 --> 00:05:04,006
No, right now.

105
00:05:04,030 --> 00:05:05,616
You have to find it for me now.

106
00:05:05,640 --> 00:05:06,976
- Please, quickly!
- Alright.

107
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:07,806
Find it now.

108
00:05:07,810 --> 00:05:08,700
Alright, I'll help you look.

109
00:05:08,710 --> 00:05:09,856
I've searched everywhere.

110
00:05:09,880 --> 00:05:10,976
My bracelet's gone.

111
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:12,320
Do you know it's missing?

112
00:05:12,560 --> 00:05:14,520
I can't remember where I put it.

113
00:05:14,910 --> 00:05:15,936
Where's my bracelet?

114
00:05:15,960 --> 00:05:17,760
Where on earth did my bracelet go?

115
00:05:20,520 --> 00:05:21,590
This is driving me mad.

116
00:05:29,080 --> 00:05:30,790
Where did I put it?

117
00:05:36,150 --> 00:05:36,990
Found it.

118
00:05:38,350 --> 00:05:39,760
Where did you find it?

119
00:05:40,150 --> 00:05:42,000
On the counter in the bathroom.

120
00:05:43,090 --> 00:05:44,536
I checked the bathroom several times.

121
00:05:44,560 --> 00:05:45,976
But I didn't see anything.

122
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:47,206
It was sitting right there.

123
00:05:47,230 --> 00:05:48,200
Goodness me.

124
00:05:49,120 --> 00:05:51,006
Am I blind? How did I not see it?

125
00:05:51,030 --> 00:05:52,006
Lihua.

126
00:05:52,030 --> 00:05:53,656
Calm down, don't be so nervous.

127
00:05:53,680 --> 00:05:56,150
If you keep worrying like this,
you'll make yourself depressed.

128
00:05:56,790 --> 00:05:58,320
Why don't you go out for a walk?

129
00:05:59,350 --> 00:06:01,640
Get some fresh air and relax a bit.

130
00:06:01,790 --> 00:06:02,830
It'll do you good.

131
00:06:03,230 --> 00:06:03,686
Alright.

132
00:06:03,710 --> 00:06:04,616
I'm not nervous now.

133
00:06:04,640 --> 00:06:05,326
Okay.

134
00:06:05,350 --> 00:06:06,366
I'm off to work.

135
00:06:06,390 --> 00:06:07,590
You're going out?

136
00:06:10,640 --> 00:06:11,480
Heavens.

137
00:06:12,200 --> 00:06:13,830
Goodness, I nearly had a heart attack.

138
00:06:34,710 --> 00:06:36,150
Answer the phone.

139
00:06:36,940 --> 00:06:40,140
(Nanxi Hotel)

140
00:06:44,270 --> 00:06:45,230
Yes, Mr. Gu.

141
00:06:45,460 --> 00:06:47,440
If you have any requests,
please tell me directly.

142
00:06:49,200 --> 00:06:50,040
Alright.

143
00:06:51,680 --> 00:06:52,520
No problem.

144
00:06:52,830 --> 00:06:53,830
Rest assured.

145
00:06:54,350 --> 00:06:55,190
Okay.

146
00:06:56,030 --> 00:06:57,686
A tour group is arriving this afternoon.

147
00:06:57,710 --> 00:06:59,176
I've already assigned the rooms.

148
00:06:59,200 --> 00:07:00,350
Double-check them.

149
00:07:00,360 --> 00:07:01,430
Make sure they're well received.

150
00:07:01,440 --> 00:07:02,280
Alright.

151
00:07:20,590 --> 00:07:21,430
It's you.

152
00:07:22,960 --> 00:07:24,856
I saw you were busy,

153
00:07:24,880 --> 00:07:26,230
so I didn't want to interrupt.

154
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:28,840
Well…

155
00:07:29,520 --> 00:07:31,560
How are you feeling?

156
00:07:33,320 --> 00:07:34,200
Pretty good.

157
00:07:36,230 --> 00:07:37,566
Any nausea?

158
00:07:37,590 --> 00:07:38,430
No.

159
00:07:38,590 --> 00:07:39,960
My appetite's been fine too.

160
00:07:43,440 --> 00:07:45,640
Good. That's great.

161
00:07:48,390 --> 00:07:49,440
Oh, right, that…

162
00:07:50,880 --> 00:07:51,686
Your uncle.

163
00:07:51,710 --> 00:07:52,550
Yes.

164
00:07:52,830 --> 00:07:54,350
My elder brother.

165
00:07:54,560 --> 00:07:56,960
He went traveling in Fujian
and bought some white fungus.

166
00:07:57,200 --> 00:07:58,886
Take it home and make white fungus soup.

167
00:07:58,910 --> 00:08:00,206
No, you keep it for yourself.

168
00:08:00,230 --> 00:08:02,830
Take it, make some soup.

169
00:08:03,080 --> 00:08:04,120
It's really good.

170
00:08:07,910 --> 00:08:08,760
Thank you.

171
00:08:09,590 --> 00:08:10,430
Thank you...

172
00:08:13,030 --> 00:08:13,960
No need to thank me.

173
00:08:14,680 --> 00:08:16,520
Don't be so polite with me.

174
00:08:19,830 --> 00:08:20,616
Well…

175
00:08:20,640 --> 00:08:22,120
I, um, I should get going.

176
00:08:22,350 --> 00:08:24,120
I'll leave you to it.

177
00:08:24,390 --> 00:08:25,230
Alright.

178
00:08:31,520 --> 00:08:32,710
Wait, wait a moment.

179
00:08:34,040 --> 00:08:34,920
Hold on a second.

180
00:08:47,440 --> 00:08:48,990
I packed some dried shrimp skins.

181
00:08:49,360 --> 00:08:51,056
They make the wonton soup
very flavorful.

182
00:08:51,080 --> 00:08:52,110
Take it and enjoy.

183
00:08:53,350 --> 00:08:54,280
Mingzhu.

184
00:08:58,040 --> 00:09:01,350
How did you know
I like dried shrimp skins?

185
00:09:02,470 --> 00:09:03,560
I didn't know.

186
00:09:04,110 --> 00:09:05,750
My mom always taught me

187
00:09:06,040 --> 00:09:07,710
never return an empty plate.

188
00:09:16,680 --> 00:09:17,920
(This daughter,)

189
00:09:18,440 --> 00:09:20,590
(from head to toe,)

190
00:09:20,830 --> 00:09:23,680
(shows every trace
of a well-raised child from another family.)

191
00:09:33,960 --> 00:09:34,800
Alright.

192
00:09:35,230 --> 00:09:36,176
Time's up.

193
00:09:36,200 --> 00:09:38,110
You may begin.

194
00:09:39,710 --> 00:09:42,470
I believe customer loyalty

195
00:09:42,630 --> 00:09:44,896
is the core of this project.

196
00:09:44,920 --> 00:09:46,776
However, the client's company

197
00:09:46,800 --> 00:09:49,160
hasn't done much online promotion.

198
00:09:49,870 --> 00:09:52,376
If, in the next three to five years,

199
00:09:52,400 --> 00:09:54,376
we can link both online
and offline efforts,

200
00:09:54,400 --> 00:09:55,326
for example,

201
00:09:55,350 --> 00:09:56,606
making online discounts

202
00:09:56,630 --> 00:09:58,536
exclusive benefits for members,

203
00:09:58,560 --> 00:10:00,936
to attract customers to shop offline,

204
00:10:00,960 --> 00:10:02,710
I think it could be
an effective approach.

205
00:10:05,870 --> 00:10:06,710
Miss Feng.

206
00:10:06,870 --> 00:10:08,686
Mr. Shen will be
at the company tomorrow.

207
00:10:08,710 --> 00:10:10,400
Do you have time for a final interview?

208
00:10:10,870 --> 00:10:11,800
Of course.

209
00:10:12,060 --> 00:10:13,606
We'll confirm the time and let you know.

210
00:10:13,630 --> 00:10:14,726
I'll be there on time.

211
00:10:14,750 --> 00:10:15,416
Thank you.

212
00:10:15,440 --> 00:10:16,510
- Thank you.
- Goodbye.

213
00:10:16,990 --> 00:10:17,416
Thank you.

214
00:10:17,440 --> 00:10:18,280
Thank you.

215
00:10:19,510 --> 00:10:20,790
This one's quite good.

216
00:10:37,510 --> 00:10:38,350
Mom.

217
00:10:39,830 --> 00:10:40,680
Feng Meiqi.

218
00:10:41,470 --> 00:10:43,680
Feng Meiqi, are you alright?

219
00:10:43,990 --> 00:10:45,080
Let me see. Quickly, look.

220
00:10:47,510 --> 00:10:48,350
Are you hurt?

221
00:10:48,830 --> 00:10:49,990
I'm fine.

222
00:10:51,230 --> 00:10:52,110
Feng Meiqi.

223
00:10:52,750 --> 00:10:54,200
This morning, I…

224
00:10:54,590 --> 00:10:56,920
I started having hallucinations.

225
00:10:57,710 --> 00:10:59,680
I couldn't find my bracelet.

226
00:11:00,230 --> 00:11:02,486
I was afraid it had fallen and broken.

227
00:11:02,510 --> 00:11:03,376
You know,

228
00:11:03,400 --> 00:11:05,680
when jade breaks, it's a bad omen.

229
00:11:06,040 --> 00:11:08,750
The bracelet was right in front of me,
yet I couldn't see it.

230
00:11:10,040 --> 00:11:12,446
I was so scared.

231
00:11:12,470 --> 00:11:13,686
I was afraid that in Shanghai,

232
00:11:13,710 --> 00:11:15,200
something might happen to you.

233
00:11:15,350 --> 00:11:17,086
My heart was racing.

234
00:11:17,110 --> 00:11:18,446
So I told the driver,

235
00:11:18,470 --> 00:11:19,990
"Go, to Shanghai."

236
00:11:20,230 --> 00:11:22,110
And I came straight here.

237
00:11:23,350 --> 00:11:24,296
It's fine.

238
00:11:24,320 --> 00:11:25,830
Mom, see? I'm fine.

239
00:11:26,400 --> 00:11:27,176
It's alright.

240
00:11:27,200 --> 00:11:28,446
I'm sorry, Meiqi.

241
00:11:28,470 --> 00:11:30,136
Did I disturb you?

242
00:11:30,160 --> 00:11:31,280
No.

243
00:11:33,200 --> 00:11:34,630
The interview went well?

244
00:11:37,960 --> 00:11:38,870
It went fine.

245
00:11:39,200 --> 00:11:40,110
Good.

246
00:11:40,710 --> 00:11:41,606
So,

247
00:11:41,630 --> 00:11:44,160
you might be working here in the future?

248
00:12:12,800 --> 00:12:13,640
Hello?

249
00:12:13,830 --> 00:12:14,726
Miss Feng.

250
00:12:14,750 --> 00:12:16,870
Would 10:30 tomorrow morning be alright?

251
00:12:21,830 --> 00:12:22,710
I'm sorry.

252
00:12:24,510 --> 00:12:26,750
Thank you for giving me
this opportunity.

253
00:12:28,510 --> 00:12:30,560
But something's happened at home,
and I may

254
00:12:31,350 --> 00:12:32,920
need to go back to be with my mom.

255
00:12:34,870 --> 00:12:35,710
Thank you.

256
00:12:57,460 --> 00:12:58,700
Please, make yourselves at home.

257
00:12:58,710 --> 00:12:59,590
Everyone, just relax.

258
00:13:00,160 --> 00:13:01,110
This is the living room.

259
00:13:02,260 --> 00:13:03,450
And over here is the kitchen.

260
00:13:03,680 --> 00:13:05,776
We really spent quite
a bit on this place.

261
00:13:05,800 --> 00:13:07,510
It's almost like a palace.

262
00:13:08,590 --> 00:13:09,590
That's a bit much, Mom.

263
00:13:09,690 --> 00:13:11,950
What kind of palace
asks people to take off their shoes?

264
00:13:12,510 --> 00:13:14,726
That's the baby cot.

265
00:13:14,730 --> 00:13:15,910
- Yes, just bought it.
- Take a look.

266
00:13:15,920 --> 00:13:17,160
Come, Mingzhu, have a look.

267
00:13:18,710 --> 00:13:19,920
The material is really good.

268
00:13:20,710 --> 00:13:22,960
See? Not a single nail in sight.

269
00:13:25,160 --> 00:13:26,510
Mr. Shen really knows his trade.

270
00:13:27,510 --> 00:13:29,176
My dad's nickname is Shen the Handy.

271
00:13:29,200 --> 00:13:30,990
He's brilliant at carpentry.

272
00:13:31,710 --> 00:13:32,726
Uncle Shen's impressive.

273
00:13:32,750 --> 00:13:33,806
You can tell he's a pro.

274
00:13:33,830 --> 00:13:34,870
An eighth-level carpenter.

275
00:13:36,870 --> 00:13:37,896
Mingzhu.

276
00:13:37,920 --> 00:13:40,536
We've installed automatic curtains here.

277
00:13:40,560 --> 00:13:42,440
They weren't working last time you came.

278
00:13:42,800 --> 00:13:43,846
Now they're fixed.

279
00:13:43,870 --> 00:13:44,776
Like this.

280
00:13:44,780 --> 00:13:46,686
The baby sleeps here,
and the adults keep watch.

281
00:13:46,700 --> 00:13:48,030
When the baby wakes up,
the curtain can be opened.

282
00:13:48,040 --> 00:13:49,176
No need to get up.

283
00:13:49,200 --> 00:13:51,750
Just press the remote
and it opens instantly.

284
00:13:52,040 --> 00:13:53,086
That's convenient.

285
00:13:53,110 --> 00:13:53,726
Yes, it is.

286
00:13:53,750 --> 00:13:55,726
If I'd had a room like this
when I was little,

287
00:13:55,730 --> 00:13:57,100
I'd have made it to university long ago.

288
00:13:57,110 --> 00:13:58,326
Then this room's yours.

289
00:13:58,350 --> 00:13:59,536
Let's see if you can get in.

290
00:13:59,560 --> 00:14:00,136
Deal.

291
00:14:00,160 --> 00:14:01,000
No, you can't.

292
00:14:02,800 --> 00:14:05,256
No, I mean,

293
00:14:05,280 --> 00:14:06,376
the bed's too small.

294
00:14:06,400 --> 00:14:08,200
He's too tall to fit.

295
00:14:08,630 --> 00:14:10,800
Just joking. Of course not.

296
00:14:11,040 --> 00:14:12,206
Yes.

297
00:14:12,230 --> 00:14:13,536
Meiqi, is the lift card ready?

298
00:14:13,560 --> 00:14:14,056
Go fetch it.

299
00:14:14,080 --> 00:14:15,150
It's done, I'll get it now.

300
00:14:15,260 --> 00:14:16,700
Come, have a seat in the living room.

301
00:14:16,710 --> 00:14:17,686
Come on, sit.

302
00:14:17,710 --> 00:14:18,550
Alright.

303
00:14:18,800 --> 00:14:19,566
Please, this way.

304
00:14:19,590 --> 00:14:20,430
Sit here.

305
00:14:21,040 --> 00:14:21,880
Nice.

306
00:14:23,920 --> 00:14:24,760
You sit there.

307
00:14:24,960 --> 00:14:26,160
Sit down, please.

308
00:14:29,350 --> 00:14:30,016
Have some fruit.

309
00:14:30,040 --> 00:14:30,920
Fruit.

310
00:14:31,080 --> 00:14:31,920
Help yourselves.

311
00:14:32,800 --> 00:14:34,686
Mr. Shen, Mrs. Shen, one card each.

312
00:14:34,690 --> 00:14:36,220
It'll be convenient
when you visit next time.

313
00:14:36,230 --> 00:14:37,446
I don't need one.

314
00:14:37,470 --> 00:14:38,470
Take it, Mrs. Shen.

315
00:14:39,960 --> 00:14:40,806
Mingzhu already has one.

316
00:14:40,830 --> 00:14:42,080
So I made three cards.

317
00:14:42,350 --> 00:14:43,206
This one's yours.

318
00:14:43,230 --> 00:14:44,160
I've got one too.

319
00:14:44,350 --> 00:14:45,416
If you don't want it, fine.

320
00:14:45,440 --> 00:14:46,280
Give it here.

321
00:14:47,750 --> 00:14:49,776
We can just share one between us.

322
00:14:49,800 --> 00:14:52,040
No, no, it's better
if everyone has one. More convenient.

323
00:14:52,510 --> 00:14:53,350
Mingzhu.

324
00:14:53,830 --> 00:14:56,566
The children's room all sorted.

325
00:14:56,590 --> 00:14:59,536
The whole place has been deep-cleaned.

326
00:14:59,560 --> 00:15:01,326
Everything you and the baby might need

327
00:15:01,350 --> 00:15:02,680
is ready and waiting.

328
00:15:04,830 --> 00:15:06,040
Why don't you move back in?

329
00:15:09,560 --> 00:15:11,056
I'd rather stay at home.

330
00:15:11,060 --> 00:15:11,910
It's more comfortable.

331
00:15:11,920 --> 00:15:13,446
It's comfortable here too.

332
00:15:13,470 --> 00:15:14,606
And very convenient.

333
00:15:14,630 --> 00:15:15,326
That's right.

334
00:15:15,350 --> 00:15:16,136
Isn't it?

335
00:15:16,160 --> 00:15:17,176
A house

336
00:15:17,200 --> 00:15:18,870
only feels alive when people live in it.

337
00:15:19,040 --> 00:15:20,320
Exactly, Mingzhu.

338
00:15:20,560 --> 00:15:22,800
Come by whenever you can.

339
00:15:24,800 --> 00:15:26,680
If you'd rather not stay,
that's fine too.

340
00:15:26,920 --> 00:15:28,896
Just drop by, have a chat, share a meal.

341
00:15:28,920 --> 00:15:29,760
That's nice as well.

342
00:15:30,160 --> 00:15:31,160
Exactly.

343
00:15:32,040 --> 00:15:33,200
Then in a few days

344
00:15:33,510 --> 00:15:35,326
I'll bring some clothes to leave here.

345
00:15:35,350 --> 00:15:37,566
No need, we've already
prepared everything for you.

346
00:15:37,590 --> 00:15:38,960
Only the best.

347
00:15:40,400 --> 00:15:42,110
Stay over tonight.

348
00:15:49,960 --> 00:15:50,686
Mom.

349
00:15:50,710 --> 00:15:52,560
Come with me to buy some wet wipes.

350
00:15:52,660 --> 00:15:53,910
No need, we have plenty at home.

351
00:15:53,920 --> 00:15:55,320
No, come on, let's go.

352
00:15:55,630 --> 00:15:57,416
The shop in the complex
is really convenient.

353
00:15:57,440 --> 00:15:57,766
Alright.

354
00:15:57,790 --> 00:15:58,776
Take your mom for a walk.

355
00:15:58,780 --> 00:15:59,950
Let her get used to the place.

356
00:16:00,200 --> 00:16:01,136
Sure.

357
00:16:01,160 --> 00:16:02,320
- Go on then.
- Alright.

358
00:16:02,470 --> 00:16:03,176
Off you go.

359
00:16:03,200 --> 00:16:05,846
If you need anything
from the shop, just take it.

360
00:16:05,870 --> 00:16:07,416
Put it on Mr. Feng's tab.

361
00:16:07,440 --> 00:16:08,280
That's right.

362
00:16:08,830 --> 00:16:09,670
Good.

363
00:16:12,460 --> 00:16:13,446
We'll go for a walk too.

364
00:16:13,470 --> 00:16:14,536
No, stay and sit.

365
00:16:14,560 --> 00:16:16,160
Meiqi, pour some tea.

366
00:16:26,320 --> 00:16:27,160
Mom.

367
00:16:28,630 --> 00:16:29,990
I want to move in.

368
00:16:30,350 --> 00:16:32,080
You've let them talk you into it.

369
00:16:32,820 --> 00:16:34,296
That family's difficult to deal with.

370
00:16:34,320 --> 00:16:35,326
If you move in,

371
00:16:35,350 --> 00:16:37,510
how will you manage day to day?

372
00:16:37,830 --> 00:16:40,320
Whether life's good
or bad depends on people.

373
00:16:40,470 --> 00:16:42,376
And on who you live with.

374
00:16:42,400 --> 00:16:43,966
That family's too hard to deal with.

375
00:16:43,990 --> 00:16:45,200
I know what I'm doing.

376
00:16:46,320 --> 00:16:48,320
I've thought a lot about it lately.

377
00:16:49,470 --> 00:16:51,280
I know they look down on me.

378
00:16:52,230 --> 00:16:53,320
Since Jianqi's gone,

379
00:16:53,560 --> 00:16:54,590
they've been kind to me,

380
00:16:54,800 --> 00:16:56,870
buying things and fixing up the flat.

381
00:16:57,230 --> 00:16:59,110
It's all for the baby I'm carrying.

382
00:17:00,470 --> 00:17:02,470
I know you and Dad care about me.

383
00:17:03,270 --> 00:17:04,006
Even without them,

384
00:17:04,030 --> 00:17:05,936
we could still raise this child.

385
00:17:05,960 --> 00:17:06,816
Exactly.

386
00:17:06,840 --> 00:17:08,206
But have you thought about this?

387
00:17:08,230 --> 00:17:10,160
If you and Dad look after the baby,

388
00:17:10,790 --> 00:17:12,750
who'll run the restaurant?

389
00:17:12,960 --> 00:17:14,896
And Minghui still needs to study.

390
00:17:14,920 --> 00:17:16,376
With a crying baby at home,

391
00:17:16,400 --> 00:17:17,616
how can he concentrate?

392
00:17:17,640 --> 00:17:18,616
We'll find a way.

393
00:17:18,640 --> 00:17:20,160
There's always a solution, right?

394
00:17:20,750 --> 00:17:22,510
And what's the goal of finding one?

395
00:17:23,120 --> 00:17:24,920
To cut ties with that family forever?

396
00:17:26,160 --> 00:17:28,270
But they're the baby's grandparents.

397
00:17:28,710 --> 00:17:30,120
That's impossible.

398
00:17:32,120 --> 00:17:33,510
Right now, this baby

399
00:17:34,160 --> 00:17:35,990
is their only emotional support.

400
00:17:37,160 --> 00:17:38,880
Otherwise his mom won't make it through.

401
00:17:39,960 --> 00:17:41,576
And Jianqi wouldn't rest easy either.

402
00:17:41,600 --> 00:17:42,680
Don't you think so?

403
00:17:44,270 --> 00:17:45,680
If I move in,

404
00:17:45,960 --> 00:17:47,920
the baby will have better conditions.

405
00:17:48,440 --> 00:17:49,136
You and Dad

406
00:17:49,160 --> 00:17:50,816
can focus on running the business.

407
00:17:50,840 --> 00:17:52,470
And Minghui can study in peace.

408
00:17:52,680 --> 00:17:53,616
It's good for everyone.

409
00:17:53,640 --> 00:17:54,960
So why shouldn't we?

410
00:17:55,790 --> 00:17:57,896
You child, honestly.

411
00:17:57,920 --> 00:18:01,096
You think about everything else,
but never about yourself.

412
00:18:01,120 --> 00:18:02,896
That woman's so overbearing.

413
00:18:02,920 --> 00:18:05,096
If you move in,
you'll have to swallow a lot.

414
00:18:05,120 --> 00:18:06,400
Meiqi told me,

415
00:18:06,640 --> 00:18:08,006
if her mom starts nagging again,

416
00:18:08,030 --> 00:18:09,550
I'll just pretend she's singing.

417
00:18:13,680 --> 00:18:14,520
Mom.

418
00:18:15,070 --> 00:18:16,270
I've grown up.

419
00:18:17,120 --> 00:18:19,710
I can't always be you and Dad's baby.

420
00:18:20,360 --> 00:18:22,160
I'm about to be a mother myself.

421
00:18:22,640 --> 00:18:24,230
I'll take good care of myself.

422
00:18:29,640 --> 00:18:31,230
Alright, give it a try then.

423
00:18:31,960 --> 00:18:34,470
When the "singing" gets
too annoying, come home.

424
00:18:35,360 --> 00:18:37,160
Still be Mom's baby, okay?

425
00:18:45,910 --> 00:18:46,446
You're back.

426
00:18:46,470 --> 00:18:47,310
We're back.

427
00:18:50,070 --> 00:18:51,680
How was the walk?

428
00:18:52,880 --> 00:18:54,640
Nice. Well,

429
00:18:55,270 --> 00:18:57,070
the neighbourhood really is nice.

430
00:18:57,200 --> 00:18:58,120
Yes.

431
00:18:59,160 --> 00:19:00,336
Oh, Mr. and Mrs. Shen,

432
00:19:00,340 --> 00:19:02,630
I almost forgot, I'll take you
to register your fingerprints later.

433
00:19:02,640 --> 00:19:04,246
Then you can unlock the door easily.

434
00:19:04,270 --> 00:19:06,176
That's not necessary. We can just knock.

435
00:19:06,200 --> 00:19:06,656
No.

436
00:19:06,680 --> 00:19:07,616
Do it.

437
00:19:07,640 --> 00:19:08,750
We're family now, aren't we?

438
00:19:12,640 --> 00:19:14,510
Mom and I talked it over.

439
00:19:15,270 --> 00:19:16,600
I'll move in.

440
00:19:16,750 --> 00:19:17,766
That's wonderful.

441
00:19:17,790 --> 00:19:20,030
Wonderful, Mingzhu.

442
00:19:20,270 --> 00:19:21,656
Truly wonderful.

443
00:19:21,680 --> 00:19:22,680
So good.

444
00:19:23,550 --> 00:19:25,640
Yes, come here, Mingzhu.

445
00:19:26,600 --> 00:19:28,616
This was passed to me
by Jianqi's grandmother.

446
00:19:28,640 --> 00:19:30,400
Now I'm passing it on to you.

447
00:19:31,270 --> 00:19:32,680
You keep it, please.

448
00:19:32,880 --> 00:19:34,336
No, I'm pregnant now.

449
00:19:34,360 --> 00:19:36,046
It's inconvenient to wear a bangle.

450
00:19:36,070 --> 00:19:37,006
Be good.

451
00:19:37,030 --> 00:19:39,640
This is a family heirloom of the Fengs.

452
00:19:39,990 --> 00:19:41,550
Now it belongs to you.

453
00:19:42,200 --> 00:19:44,200
Wear it. It'll keep you safe.

454
00:19:44,920 --> 00:19:45,790
Right, Feng?

455
00:19:46,510 --> 00:19:47,350
That's right.

456
00:19:47,680 --> 00:19:48,750
Put it on.

457
00:19:50,070 --> 00:19:51,070
Wear it properly.

458
00:19:52,400 --> 00:19:53,270
Thank you, Mom.

459
00:19:57,360 --> 00:19:59,510
Our daughter really has it hard.

460
00:20:00,400 --> 00:20:02,470
She's thought of everything.

461
00:20:02,840 --> 00:20:03,790
That's true.

462
00:20:04,120 --> 00:20:06,030
Mingzhu tends to overthink everything,

463
00:20:06,600 --> 00:20:08,310
but she's clear-headed inside.

464
00:20:08,600 --> 00:20:09,550
Look at Meiqi.

465
00:20:09,920 --> 00:20:12,200
When she asked us
to register our fingerprints,

466
00:20:13,070 --> 00:20:14,680
she was so happy watching.

467
00:20:15,120 --> 00:20:17,880
She just wants both families
to become one.

468
00:20:18,160 --> 00:20:19,160
I know that.

469
00:20:19,310 --> 00:20:20,360
Once the baby's born,

470
00:20:20,750 --> 00:20:22,920
we'll be one family no matter what.

471
00:20:23,070 --> 00:20:25,046
The problem is,
they're hard to deal with.

472
00:20:25,070 --> 00:20:27,766
Looks like we can't avoid them for life.

473
00:20:27,790 --> 00:20:29,336
Stop thinking like that.

474
00:20:29,360 --> 00:20:30,200
Come on.

475
00:20:30,680 --> 00:20:32,936
You can't judge them with old thinking.

476
00:20:32,960 --> 00:20:35,360
Who would hand over
their house keys to you?

477
00:20:35,960 --> 00:20:37,160
They did.

478
00:20:37,360 --> 00:20:38,336
It's just a key.

479
00:20:38,360 --> 00:20:39,936
If I give them ours, would they come?

480
00:20:39,960 --> 00:20:41,246
They look down on you.

481
00:20:41,270 --> 00:20:42,286
Oh, stop it.

482
00:20:42,310 --> 00:20:43,990
What do we even have at home?

483
00:20:44,440 --> 00:20:46,446
Besides, the baby's due soon.

484
00:20:46,470 --> 00:20:48,726
It'll still be cold
when she gives birth.

485
00:20:48,730 --> 00:20:51,110
Their place keeps a steady temperature
and humidity. Perfect.

486
00:20:51,120 --> 00:20:52,360
The baby will be comfortable.

487
00:20:52,410 --> 00:20:53,350
If she stayed at ours...

488
00:20:54,750 --> 00:20:55,376
Don't.

489
00:20:55,400 --> 00:20:56,726
Listen, I'm telling you.

490
00:20:56,750 --> 00:20:59,310
Our daughter
needs proper postpartum rest.

491
00:21:00,230 --> 00:21:02,046
Otherwise, she could end up sick.

492
00:21:02,070 --> 00:21:03,440
I'll take care of her myself.

493
00:21:04,310 --> 00:21:06,096
Jianqi's mom fusses all day long.

494
00:21:06,120 --> 00:21:07,376
She can't do any real work.

495
00:21:07,400 --> 00:21:08,750
We can't count on her.

496
00:21:10,360 --> 00:21:11,640
You think they'd let you?

497
00:21:11,880 --> 00:21:13,440
They'll hire a maternity nanny.

498
00:21:14,030 --> 00:21:16,200
That's expensive, you know.

499
00:21:16,920 --> 00:21:19,200
Give me that money instead,
I'll be the nanny.

500
00:21:20,790 --> 00:21:21,710
You and your money.

501
00:21:22,510 --> 00:21:25,096
Our daughter's too shy to ask directly.

502
00:21:25,120 --> 00:21:26,790
Let the money go through me first.

503
00:21:27,400 --> 00:21:28,550
I'll save it for her.

504
00:21:28,920 --> 00:21:30,750
That family's always
talking about the baby,

505
00:21:30,760 --> 00:21:31,966
but they never do anything real.

506
00:21:31,990 --> 00:21:33,750
Just talk, right?

507
00:21:37,070 --> 00:21:37,910
Real action.

508
00:21:38,360 --> 00:21:40,840
What mother asks for money
to care for her daughter?

509
00:21:41,840 --> 00:21:43,486
You don't get what I mean.

510
00:21:43,510 --> 00:21:44,656
Did I say I wanted money?

511
00:21:44,680 --> 00:21:45,920
It's for our daughter.

512
00:21:47,030 --> 00:21:48,336
You never listen properly.

513
00:21:48,360 --> 00:21:49,200
Dad.

514
00:21:50,660 --> 00:21:51,656
Why are you two so slow?

515
00:21:51,680 --> 00:21:52,920
I've been waiting ages.

516
00:21:53,360 --> 00:21:55,250
- You weren't exactly fast on the bike.
- Water.

517
00:21:55,550 --> 00:21:56,400
Bought it for you.

518
00:21:57,510 --> 00:21:58,440
Stop wasting money.

519
00:21:58,600 --> 00:22:00,006
I used my own pocket money.

520
00:22:00,030 --> 00:22:01,410
One bottle's enough for both of us.

521
00:22:03,310 --> 00:22:04,200
You drink first.

522
00:22:09,120 --> 00:22:09,960
Oh right.

523
00:22:10,510 --> 00:22:12,136
Let's stop by Ni Debao's house later.

524
00:22:12,160 --> 00:22:13,000
What for?

525
00:22:13,840 --> 00:22:15,960
To get some
of Xiaoni's old baby clothes.

526
00:22:16,160 --> 00:22:18,510
People say wearing
hand-me-downs brings good luck.

527
00:22:19,030 --> 00:22:20,790
And Xiaoni's so clever.

528
00:22:21,120 --> 00:22:23,230
Our grandchild will be just as smart.

529
00:22:23,400 --> 00:22:24,920
When the baby's born,

530
00:22:25,400 --> 00:22:27,030
don't let him see anyone first.

531
00:22:27,440 --> 00:22:28,510
Especially not his uncle.

532
00:22:29,510 --> 00:22:31,680
That's true, definitely not.

533
00:22:31,960 --> 00:22:32,880
Why not, Mom?

534
00:22:33,550 --> 00:22:35,200
Why not?

535
00:22:35,440 --> 00:22:37,200
Why can't he see me?

536
00:22:37,710 --> 00:22:38,966
He just can't.

537
00:22:38,990 --> 00:22:40,686
I've got plenty of old clothes too.

538
00:22:40,710 --> 00:22:42,120
I could give some to my nephew.

539
00:22:42,640 --> 00:22:44,030
Aren't I cleverer than Xiaoni?

540
00:22:44,270 --> 00:22:45,176
You are clever,

541
00:22:45,200 --> 00:22:46,856
just not in the right way.

542
00:22:46,880 --> 00:22:48,270
But at least I'm good-looking.

543
00:22:51,640 --> 00:22:52,480
Zhixia.

544
00:22:52,710 --> 00:22:54,880
This is our Castilla Berry Collection.

545
00:22:55,120 --> 00:22:57,576
Twelve shades in total, ten of each.

546
00:22:57,600 --> 00:22:59,160
That's one hundred and twenty pieces.

547
00:22:59,440 --> 00:23:01,856
I requested these
specially from headquarters.

548
00:23:01,880 --> 00:23:03,840
They're for the fans of Zhixia Speaks.

549
00:23:04,880 --> 00:23:05,720
Don't worry.

550
00:23:05,920 --> 00:23:08,030
I'll make sure the Berry Collection

551
00:23:08,160 --> 00:23:09,160
gets plenty of traffic.

552
00:23:11,680 --> 00:23:13,120
Fearless Sister.

553
00:23:13,790 --> 00:23:14,840
Pleasure working with you.

554
00:23:15,410 --> 00:23:16,470
Pleasure working with you.

555
00:23:16,920 --> 00:23:18,310
Generous Brother.

556
00:23:19,990 --> 00:23:20,830
Xiu'e.

557
00:23:20,960 --> 00:23:23,096
I've kept all

558
00:23:23,120 --> 00:23:24,336
of Xiaoni's clothes and toys.

559
00:23:24,360 --> 00:23:25,726
Let me find them for you.

560
00:23:25,750 --> 00:23:26,710
Alright, thank you.

561
00:23:27,160 --> 00:23:28,470
Eight-Treasure Health Tea.

562
00:23:28,880 --> 00:23:29,840
You make tea too?

563
00:23:30,230 --> 00:23:31,486
I blended it myself.

564
00:23:31,510 --> 00:23:33,440
It nourishes the kidneys
and boosts energy.

565
00:23:35,070 --> 00:23:36,446
I've been drinking it for ages.

566
00:23:36,470 --> 00:23:37,880
Even my black hair's growing back.

567
00:23:38,160 --> 00:23:41,030
Dad, you don't have black hair,
it's all white.

568
00:23:41,440 --> 00:23:42,280
Xiaoni.

569
00:23:42,960 --> 00:23:44,440
You little rascal.

570
00:23:44,820 --> 00:23:45,840
Always speaking the truth.

571
00:23:46,360 --> 00:23:47,200
Ni Debao.

572
00:23:47,840 --> 00:23:49,046
That box on the cabinet.

573
00:23:49,070 --> 00:23:50,206
Come help me get it down.

574
00:23:50,230 --> 00:23:50,896
You two sit.

575
00:23:50,920 --> 00:23:51,686
Need a hand?

576
00:23:51,710 --> 00:23:52,600
No, it's fine.

577
00:23:52,840 --> 00:23:53,750
Xiaoni.

578
00:23:54,200 --> 00:23:55,990
They say you're amazing.

579
00:23:56,310 --> 00:23:57,896
You take pulses so accurately. Come on.

580
00:23:57,920 --> 00:23:59,710
Why don't you check mine too?

581
00:24:04,680 --> 00:24:06,160
Pregnancy pulse.

582
00:24:08,070 --> 00:24:08,910
What?

583
00:24:10,710 --> 00:24:11,550
What?

584
00:24:11,840 --> 00:24:12,680
Pregnancy pulse.

585
00:24:31,180 --> 00:24:33,100
(Pregnancy Test)

586
00:24:38,200 --> 00:24:39,040
Ni Debao.

587
00:24:40,120 --> 00:24:40,960
Come in.

588
00:24:46,510 --> 00:24:48,400
Why is one pregnancy test missing?

589
00:24:49,070 --> 00:24:49,920
No way.

590
00:24:53,360 --> 00:24:54,510
I didn't sell any.

591
00:24:56,200 --> 00:24:58,360
You didn't, and neither did I.

592
00:24:59,070 --> 00:25:00,510
There were five before.

593
00:25:00,640 --> 00:25:01,480
Look for yourself.

594
00:25:01,750 --> 00:25:03,270
Now there's one missing.

595
00:25:03,920 --> 00:25:05,230
I've got no idea.

596
00:25:08,310 --> 00:25:10,120
Don't look at me like that.

597
00:25:10,660 --> 00:25:12,816
There are only three of us here,
me, you, and Xiaoni.

598
00:25:12,840 --> 00:25:14,206
Could it be Xiaoni who took it?

599
00:25:14,210 --> 00:25:16,020
So if it wasn't Xiaoni,
are you saying I took it?

600
00:25:16,030 --> 00:25:17,286
Be honest with me.

601
00:25:17,310 --> 00:25:19,400
Did you get someone else
pregnant outside again?

602
00:25:19,840 --> 00:25:21,360
Don't talk nonsense.

603
00:25:21,990 --> 00:25:23,030
Nonsense?

604
00:25:23,750 --> 00:25:25,376
You know perfectly well

605
00:25:25,380 --> 00:25:26,590
what trouble you've stirred up.

606
00:25:26,600 --> 00:25:27,486
Of course I do.

607
00:25:27,510 --> 00:25:28,936
Because I've done nothing wrong!

608
00:25:28,960 --> 00:25:31,206
If not, why does your ex-wife
hate you so much?

609
00:25:31,230 --> 00:25:34,136
Every day she puts your photo
facing our window to disgust us.

610
00:25:34,160 --> 00:25:35,200
She's sick in the head.

611
00:25:35,400 --> 00:25:37,336
She's sick? I must be too.

612
00:25:37,360 --> 00:25:39,416
If I'd known the truth back
at Nanxi Bridge,

613
00:25:39,440 --> 00:25:41,160
I'd never have married you in a rush.

614
00:25:41,470 --> 00:25:43,400
What's the point of saying that now?

615
00:25:43,750 --> 00:25:45,486
A man's youth isn't wasted on romance.

616
00:25:45,510 --> 00:25:47,136
That's all in the past.

617
00:25:47,160 --> 00:25:48,376
Since we got married,

618
00:25:48,400 --> 00:25:50,726
tell me honestly, how have I behaved?

619
00:25:50,750 --> 00:25:52,286
All I see is the surface.

620
00:25:52,310 --> 00:25:53,446
What about what I can't see?

621
00:25:53,470 --> 00:25:55,270
I'm the same inside and out.

622
00:25:55,640 --> 00:25:56,816
Who would believe that?

623
00:25:56,820 --> 00:25:58,470
- What are you doing?
- Tell me clearly.

624
00:25:59,030 --> 00:26:00,176
Where's the pregnancy test?

625
00:26:00,180 --> 00:26:01,700
Don't tell me you're going
to hit me again.

626
00:26:01,710 --> 00:26:03,310
This isn't the first time.

627
00:26:03,510 --> 00:26:04,686
So what if I do?

628
00:26:04,710 --> 00:26:06,470
I'll make it a daily habit.

629
00:26:06,790 --> 00:26:08,096
If you don't tell me today,

630
00:26:08,120 --> 00:26:09,446
we're done for good.

631
00:26:09,470 --> 00:26:09,966
Talk.

632
00:26:09,990 --> 00:26:11,230
Then we're done.

633
00:26:11,340 --> 00:26:12,910
- Who wants to stay with you anyway?
- Get back here.

634
00:26:12,920 --> 00:26:13,616
Come back here.

635
00:26:13,640 --> 00:26:14,576
You wild woman.

636
00:26:14,580 --> 00:26:15,856
- Where do you think you're going?
- You're insane.

637
00:26:15,880 --> 00:26:16,840
Stop right there.

638
00:26:17,030 --> 00:26:18,176
Where are you running off to?

639
00:26:18,200 --> 00:26:19,880
Touch me again and I'll call the police.

640
00:26:20,310 --> 00:26:22,070
Aren't you afraid of making a scene?

641
00:26:22,200 --> 00:26:23,446
I'm not afraid.

642
00:26:23,470 --> 00:26:24,206
Why should I be?

643
00:26:24,230 --> 00:26:25,610
If you're not afraid, neither am I.

644
00:26:26,030 --> 00:26:27,286
Tell me the truth.

645
00:26:27,290 --> 00:26:28,220
Where's the pregnancy test?

646
00:26:28,230 --> 00:26:29,840
Who did you give it to?

647
00:26:30,070 --> 00:26:31,896
I swore on my own photo already.

648
00:26:31,920 --> 00:26:33,710
If you still don't believe me,
what can I do?

649
00:26:33,840 --> 00:26:35,920
Believe you? Not a chance.

650
00:26:37,070 --> 00:26:37,686
You're insane.

651
00:26:37,710 --> 00:26:38,880
Now I'm starting to wonder

652
00:26:39,160 --> 00:26:40,816
did you meet me before the divorce

653
00:26:40,840 --> 00:26:42,120
or after it?

654
00:26:42,550 --> 00:26:43,936
That's easy to prove.

655
00:26:43,960 --> 00:26:45,576
Just look at the divorce certificate.

656
00:26:45,600 --> 00:26:46,640
Where is it then?

657
00:26:46,840 --> 00:26:48,486
Have you ever shown it to me?

658
00:26:48,510 --> 00:26:50,096
The divorce certificate isn't with me.

659
00:26:50,120 --> 00:26:51,286
It's with that wild woman.

660
00:26:51,310 --> 00:26:52,766
I've never even seen it myself.

661
00:26:52,770 --> 00:26:54,540
Fine then, give me
my divorce certificate back.

662
00:26:54,550 --> 00:26:56,616
- Who are you calling a wild woman?
- Enough.

663
00:26:56,620 --> 00:26:57,446
- Then ask her.
- Mom.

664
00:26:57,470 --> 00:26:58,766
Was it after the divorce

665
00:26:58,790 --> 00:26:59,416
that I met her?

666
00:26:59,440 --> 00:27:00,576
Answer me first.

667
00:27:00,600 --> 00:27:02,576
Did you divorce me
before meeting her or after?

668
00:27:02,600 --> 00:27:03,576
Say it clearly.

669
00:27:03,580 --> 00:27:05,260
- You've never told the truth once.
- Shameless man.

670
00:27:05,270 --> 00:27:06,966
I must be blind
to have married two wild women.

671
00:27:06,970 --> 00:27:08,350
- Then hit him hard, hit him to death.
- I was blind to marry you.

672
00:27:08,360 --> 00:27:08,950
Alright, enough.

673
00:27:08,960 --> 00:27:09,830
That's enough, Mom. Let's go.

674
00:27:09,840 --> 00:27:10,830
We'll go home.
He needs to be taught a lesson.

675
00:27:10,840 --> 00:27:12,616
I'll call the police
if you hit me again.

676
00:27:12,640 --> 00:27:13,710
You wouldn't dare.

677
00:27:14,400 --> 00:27:16,336
Let me tell you,
when you find a boyfriend,

678
00:27:16,360 --> 00:27:17,766
don't find someone like him.

679
00:27:17,790 --> 00:27:19,600
What if I end up just like Dad?

680
00:27:22,790 --> 00:27:24,400
Then I'll cut ties with you too.

681
00:27:28,790 --> 00:27:30,006
So? What now?

682
00:27:30,030 --> 00:27:37,030
(Caution: Slippery Floor)

683
00:27:45,270 --> 00:27:46,600
Get ready to be a dad.

684
00:27:47,310 --> 00:27:48,640
What do you mean?

685
00:27:52,840 --> 00:27:55,030
Scared me for nothing.

686
00:27:56,200 --> 00:27:57,470
See, I told you.

687
00:27:58,160 --> 00:28:00,710
You actually believed what a kid said?

688
00:28:00,960 --> 00:28:02,046
Oh my, that scared me.

689
00:28:02,070 --> 00:28:03,096
Couldn't find the test.

690
00:28:03,120 --> 00:28:04,710
Hit me again and I'll fight back.

691
00:28:05,030 --> 00:28:06,336
You dare fight back?

692
00:28:06,340 --> 00:28:07,830
If we don't find
that pregnancy test today,

693
00:28:07,840 --> 00:28:08,896
I'm divorcing you.

694
00:28:08,920 --> 00:28:10,840
Fine by me, it's not my first time.

695
00:28:10,990 --> 00:28:12,726
Good.

696
00:28:12,750 --> 00:28:13,710
Then do it.

697
00:28:13,960 --> 00:28:16,120
Stop right there.

698
00:28:16,270 --> 00:28:17,896
Should we go and explain it to them?

699
00:28:17,920 --> 00:28:19,120
Explain what?

700
00:28:21,310 --> 00:28:23,470
That I'm not capable, right?

701
00:28:24,440 --> 00:28:26,270
No, that's not what I meant.

702
00:28:27,400 --> 00:28:29,310
You're too old
to still be this childish.

703
00:28:31,840 --> 00:28:33,680
What are we going to do
about your maths?

704
00:28:34,360 --> 00:28:35,856
Shall I enroll you in another class?

705
00:28:35,880 --> 00:28:37,790
No. You don't even have the money.

706
00:28:41,360 --> 00:28:42,200
Mom.

707
00:28:43,020 --> 00:28:44,260
Have you finished your homework?

708
00:28:44,620 --> 00:28:45,396
Not yet.

709
00:28:45,400 --> 00:28:47,130
She still need to memorize
one more poem for Chinese.

710
00:28:47,140 --> 00:28:48,820
And her maths still isn't done.

711
00:28:49,260 --> 00:28:50,340
Alright, go on then.

712
00:28:50,740 --> 00:28:51,580
Oh right.

713
00:28:51,940 --> 00:28:53,100
The head of Human Resources...

714
00:28:53,260 --> 00:28:54,100
I'm coming.

715
00:28:54,300 --> 00:28:55,500
Stop rushing me, I'm here.

716
00:28:56,820 --> 00:28:58,420
No one even called him.

717
00:29:01,620 --> 00:29:02,460
Hello, Mom.

718
00:29:03,020 --> 00:29:03,860
Zhixia.

719
00:29:04,780 --> 00:29:05,820
How have you been lately?

720
00:29:06,060 --> 00:29:06,916
Quite good.

721
00:29:06,940 --> 00:29:09,876
Jiao goes to Zhang Hao's place
after school to do her homework.

722
00:29:09,900 --> 00:29:11,340
I'll pick her up when I finish work.

723
00:29:12,500 --> 00:29:14,700
Do you need me to do anything for you?

724
00:29:15,460 --> 00:29:16,420
A bit of persuasion.

725
00:29:18,100 --> 00:29:18,940
What do you mean?

726
00:29:19,340 --> 00:29:20,340
What are you doing?

727
00:29:23,700 --> 00:29:24,860
Why did Zhixia say

728
00:29:25,420 --> 00:29:27,396
your name isn't on the candidate list?

729
00:29:27,420 --> 00:29:28,700
Didn't you sign up?

730
00:29:30,260 --> 00:29:31,100
I...

731
00:29:31,900 --> 00:29:33,140
I just thought

732
00:29:33,150 --> 00:29:35,550
being Head of Human Resources
means I can't leave work easily.

733
00:29:35,660 --> 00:29:37,596
Then who will pick Jiao up
from school every day?

734
00:29:37,620 --> 00:29:39,076
You just focus on the competition.

735
00:29:39,100 --> 00:29:40,260
I'll handle Jiao.

736
00:29:40,420 --> 00:29:42,940
At worst, she can
walk home herself, right?

737
00:29:43,340 --> 00:29:43,836
Yes.

738
00:29:43,860 --> 00:29:44,716
Children

739
00:29:44,740 --> 00:29:45,876
need independence.

740
00:29:45,900 --> 00:29:46,740
That's right.

741
00:29:46,840 --> 00:29:47,956
Several of Jiao's classmates

742
00:29:47,980 --> 00:29:49,716
already walk home by themselves.

743
00:29:49,720 --> 00:29:50,620
Isn't that right, Jiao?

744
00:29:51,260 --> 00:29:52,836
Chen Liwen walks home alone.

745
00:29:52,860 --> 00:29:54,840
- I can walk home with her.
- Don't be ridiculous.

746
00:29:56,270 --> 00:29:56,836
Listen to me.

747
00:29:56,860 --> 00:29:58,996
You know Mr. Wang
from our logistics department,

748
00:29:59,020 --> 00:29:59,860
right?

749
00:30:00,260 --> 00:30:02,780
His son used to go to and from school
alone every day.

750
00:30:03,100 --> 00:30:04,060
He had a car accident.

751
00:30:04,500 --> 00:30:06,220
Really, I'm not making this up.

752
00:30:06,540 --> 00:30:08,260
It's a lifelong regret.

753
00:30:09,420 --> 00:30:11,740
Nothing about a child
is ever a small matter.

754
00:30:12,180 --> 00:30:13,610
Being Head of Human Resources
isn't what matters.

755
00:30:13,620 --> 00:30:15,780
What matters is
you have to take care of your family.

756
00:30:16,060 --> 00:30:17,156
Besides, look at Zhixia now.

757
00:30:17,180 --> 00:30:18,340
She's heavily pregnant.

758
00:30:19,180 --> 00:30:20,020
Exactly, Mom.

759
00:30:20,300 --> 00:30:21,756
I'm carrying a big belly,

760
00:30:21,780 --> 00:30:24,196
and I'm still out there
pulling in advertising deals.

761
00:30:24,200 --> 00:30:24,956
You're a grown man.

762
00:30:24,980 --> 00:30:26,396
Why aren't you more ambitious?

763
00:30:26,420 --> 00:30:27,516
Why not aim higher?

764
00:30:27,540 --> 00:30:30,740
Son, you have to strive
to do better in life.

765
00:30:31,420 --> 00:30:34,236
This world is so realistic now.

766
00:30:34,260 --> 00:30:35,396
If you don't lead others,

767
00:30:35,420 --> 00:30:37,020
then others will lead you.

768
00:30:37,420 --> 00:30:39,620
You think having no title
makes you free?

769
00:30:39,900 --> 00:30:41,196
You're light as a feather.

770
00:30:41,220 --> 00:30:42,356
Anyone with a puff of air

771
00:30:42,380 --> 00:30:44,756
could blow you off balance.

772
00:30:44,780 --> 00:30:46,076
I'm not made of paper.

773
00:30:46,100 --> 00:30:47,276
Mom has a point.

774
00:30:47,300 --> 00:30:50,060
Other kids' dads are Mr. Wang or Mr. Li.

775
00:30:50,220 --> 00:30:51,580
Only my dad is Zhang.

776
00:30:51,740 --> 00:30:52,580
No, that's not right.

777
00:30:52,660 --> 00:30:54,076
In a few years, he'll be Old Zhang.

778
00:30:54,100 --> 00:30:55,420
And after that?

779
00:30:55,540 --> 00:30:56,700
Then he'll be Elder Zhang.

780
00:30:57,180 --> 00:30:58,020
Elder Zhang.

781
00:30:58,420 --> 00:30:59,260
You...

782
00:30:59,620 --> 00:31:00,860
I never would've imagined

783
00:31:01,140 --> 00:31:03,116
the three of you would gang up on me.

784
00:31:03,140 --> 00:31:03,980
Mom.

785
00:31:07,180 --> 00:31:08,150
The vegetables are fine.

786
00:31:08,460 --> 00:31:10,540
Pass me a pair of chopsticks.

787
00:31:11,590 --> 00:31:13,066
Let's make a little toast then.

788
00:31:13,090 --> 00:31:14,026
My darlings.

789
00:31:14,050 --> 00:31:14,696
Come on.

790
00:31:14,720 --> 00:31:15,510
Cheers.

791
00:31:19,020 --> 00:31:20,396
You're still up this late.

792
00:31:20,420 --> 00:31:22,020
Why are you wandering around?

793
00:31:22,220 --> 00:31:23,060
I can't sleep.

794
00:31:24,420 --> 00:31:25,420
What's wrong now?

795
00:31:26,700 --> 00:31:27,436
You said yourself

796
00:31:27,460 --> 00:31:29,356
you'd give me Grandma's jade bangle.

797
00:31:29,380 --> 00:31:30,220
And then what?

798
00:31:30,940 --> 00:31:32,440
Feng Meiqi.

799
00:31:32,660 --> 00:31:34,260
I already know what you're going to say.

800
00:31:37,220 --> 00:31:38,156
What's that?

801
00:31:38,180 --> 00:31:39,300
When I was in Shanghai,

802
00:31:39,760 --> 00:31:41,916
I bought this dress
for your precious daughter-in-law.

803
00:31:41,940 --> 00:31:43,180
Send it to her.

804
00:31:43,620 --> 00:31:44,700
Really?

805
00:31:46,700 --> 00:31:47,596
Let me see it.

806
00:31:47,620 --> 00:31:48,460
Praise me first.

807
00:31:50,900 --> 00:31:51,740
Very nice.

808
00:31:52,960 --> 00:31:53,940
Then I'm not showing you.

809
00:32:05,780 --> 00:32:06,620
Zhang Hao.

810
00:32:07,580 --> 00:32:08,700
Be honest with me.

811
00:32:09,380 --> 00:32:10,596
You prepared that thick stack

812
00:32:10,620 --> 00:32:12,210
of documents
for the position application.

813
00:32:12,220 --> 00:32:13,980
Why didn't you hand it in?

814
00:32:15,420 --> 00:32:16,940
We've been married for so many years.

815
00:32:17,220 --> 00:32:19,840
I can tell from the way you talk
whether you're telling the truth.

816
00:32:24,220 --> 00:32:25,876
Your mom said
she'll come again tomorrow.

817
00:32:25,900 --> 00:32:27,420
My mom? Don't let her come.

818
00:32:28,940 --> 00:32:30,180
I'll tell you the truth.

819
00:32:31,820 --> 00:32:34,820
You know Wu
from our design institute, right?

820
00:32:36,260 --> 00:32:38,860
A couple of days ago,
he quietly came to see me.

821
00:32:39,800 --> 00:32:41,636
He said if he doesn't
get the Head position,

822
00:32:41,660 --> 00:32:43,300
his wife will divorce him.

823
00:32:44,060 --> 00:32:44,900
Then what?

824
00:32:45,980 --> 00:32:48,980
His family started
pulling strings and making calls.

825
00:32:49,300 --> 00:32:50,836
His contacts told him

826
00:32:50,860 --> 00:32:53,220
that if they handle
senior colleagues like us,

827
00:32:53,460 --> 00:32:54,780
he'll be fine.

828
00:32:55,220 --> 00:32:56,180
And then?

829
00:32:57,500 --> 00:32:59,980
Then Wu said to me,

830
00:33:00,420 --> 00:33:01,300
look,

831
00:33:01,940 --> 00:33:03,260
after he becomes Head,

832
00:33:03,540 --> 00:33:04,860
his salary will rise a level,

833
00:33:05,100 --> 00:33:06,700
and the year-end bonus will rise too.

834
00:33:06,960 --> 00:33:09,050
But he said he doesn't want
the money. It's all mine.

835
00:33:09,100 --> 00:33:10,700
He just wants the title of Head.

836
00:33:10,900 --> 00:33:12,396
I thought that sounded fair.

837
00:33:12,420 --> 00:33:14,500
Why do I need a title for vanity anyway?

838
00:33:14,700 --> 00:33:16,500
He does the work, you take the money.

839
00:33:16,660 --> 00:33:17,660
Yes, that's the idea.

840
00:33:17,980 --> 00:33:19,740
Zhang Hao, are you stupid?

841
00:33:20,660 --> 00:33:23,636
If Wu becomes Director Wu,
what if he doesn't keep his promise?

842
00:33:23,660 --> 00:33:25,100
What if he makes things hard for you?

843
00:33:25,260 --> 00:33:26,356
What if he transfers you

844
00:33:26,380 --> 00:33:28,516
to a construction site
for months on end?

845
00:33:28,540 --> 00:33:29,420
What will you do then?

846
00:33:30,060 --> 00:33:31,660
No, that's impossible.

847
00:33:32,140 --> 00:33:33,996
I know Wu. He's an honest man.

848
00:33:34,020 --> 00:33:35,620
Honest? He dug you such a big hole.

849
00:33:35,940 --> 00:33:37,556
You'll go talk to him tomorrow.

850
00:33:37,580 --> 00:33:38,420
Tell him.

851
00:33:38,580 --> 00:33:40,620
You must take part in this competition.

852
00:33:41,500 --> 00:33:43,180
Otherwise, your wife
will divorce you too.

853
00:33:43,620 --> 00:33:44,956
He won't believe that.

854
00:33:44,980 --> 00:33:46,720
He knows you're pregnant
with the second child.

855
00:33:47,060 --> 00:33:49,220
Who says being pregnant
means you can't divorce?

856
00:33:50,180 --> 00:33:51,596
Once I make up my mind,

857
00:33:51,620 --> 00:33:52,916
even if I were carrying
seven little heroes,

858
00:33:52,940 --> 00:33:53,916
I'd still divorce you.

859
00:33:53,940 --> 00:33:55,610
There's no point
in saying things in anger.

860
00:33:55,620 --> 00:33:56,660
I'm serious, Zhang Hao.

861
00:33:58,180 --> 00:33:59,556
Go to Human Resources tomorrow.

862
00:33:59,580 --> 00:34:01,140
Submit your application materials.

863
00:34:01,380 --> 00:34:03,876
The registration has closed.

864
00:34:03,900 --> 00:34:04,916
It's not a national exam.

865
00:34:04,940 --> 00:34:06,980
A day or two late won't matter.

866
00:34:07,980 --> 00:34:09,356
Forget it, don't go alone.

867
00:34:09,380 --> 00:34:10,436
Go find Wu.

868
00:34:10,460 --> 00:34:11,770
Tell him you've changed your mind.

869
00:34:11,780 --> 00:34:13,420
Ask him to help you contact HR.

870
00:34:14,220 --> 00:34:15,676
I believe he wouldn't dare refuse.

871
00:34:15,700 --> 00:34:16,740
If I ask Wu...

872
00:34:17,100 --> 00:34:17,796
No, but then,

873
00:34:17,820 --> 00:34:19,820
won't that ruin
our working relationship?

874
00:34:21,740 --> 00:34:22,580
Zhang Hao.

875
00:34:24,580 --> 00:34:26,940
So you'd rather ruin your marriage?

876
00:34:27,060 --> 00:34:28,756
Or ruin your relationship
with a colleague?

877
00:34:28,780 --> 00:34:29,620
With the colleague.

878
00:34:30,620 --> 00:34:31,540
With the colleague.

879
00:34:32,340 --> 00:34:33,500
With the colleague.

880
00:34:34,180 --> 00:34:35,660
Then that settles it.

881
00:34:36,060 --> 00:34:37,556
Sleep now. Be good.

882
00:34:37,580 --> 00:34:38,820
Watch your head.

883
00:34:39,660 --> 00:34:40,740
Pull up the blanket.

884
00:34:47,020 --> 00:34:47,860
Baby.

885
00:34:48,140 --> 00:34:50,340
When you're born, you must be a boy.

886
00:34:51,460 --> 00:34:53,060
Dad doesn't prefer sons over daughters.

887
00:34:54,660 --> 00:34:56,116
Dad just wants another teammate.

888
00:34:56,140 --> 00:34:58,660
What for, to take sides during fights?

889
00:34:59,460 --> 00:35:01,060
To have someone to play football with.

890
00:35:05,900 --> 00:35:08,196
Zhidong, your brother-in-law
wants to play football.

891
00:35:08,220 --> 00:35:09,060
Arrange it.

892
00:35:10,980 --> 00:35:11,820
What are you doing?

893
00:35:12,100 --> 00:35:12,980
Good night.

894
00:35:15,020 --> 00:35:15,356
You're…

895
00:35:15,380 --> 00:35:17,060
You're trying to kill me, aren't you?

896
00:35:18,980 --> 00:35:20,340
Come on, Hao, grab it!

897
00:35:22,460 --> 00:35:23,620
Go for it, come on!

898
00:35:29,380 --> 00:35:30,580
Hao, get up!

899
00:35:31,380 --> 00:35:32,276
Are you faking it?

900
00:35:32,300 --> 00:35:33,180
Ow, that hurts!

901
00:35:33,540 --> 00:35:34,380
Get up quickly!

902
00:35:35,780 --> 00:35:36,980
Can you even handle it?

903
00:35:38,020 --> 00:35:40,220
Of course, I'm great at this.

904
00:35:40,660 --> 00:35:43,220
You could say I'm steady as a rock.

905
00:35:43,460 --> 00:35:45,500
Good, then prove it.

906
00:35:46,860 --> 00:35:48,060
Help this old rock up first.

907
00:35:48,420 --> 00:35:49,620
So much effort.

908
00:35:50,300 --> 00:35:51,140
All right.

909
00:35:51,380 --> 00:35:52,220
Let's start.

910
00:35:54,300 --> 00:35:55,276
Wasn't that it?

911
00:35:55,300 --> 00:35:56,420
That was just the warm-up.

912
00:35:56,860 --> 00:35:58,300
Now the real match begins.

913
00:35:58,740 --> 00:35:59,660
Let's split into teams.

914
00:36:00,380 --> 00:36:02,236
How about we stick to the same side?

915
00:36:02,260 --> 00:36:03,560
- You guys at one side.
- No, I need a break.

916
00:36:03,580 --> 00:36:05,140
- You can form another side later.
- I need a rest.

917
00:36:05,150 --> 00:36:06,100
I need a rest.

918
00:36:06,980 --> 00:36:07,820
Mingzhu.

919
00:36:08,100 --> 00:36:10,156
This is a gift I picked
for you in Shanghai.

920
00:36:10,180 --> 00:36:12,380
You can wear it
as a maternity dress or on holiday.

921
00:36:12,620 --> 00:36:14,540
I hope you'll always stay beautiful.

922
00:36:17,700 --> 00:36:18,540
Jianqi.

923
00:36:18,820 --> 00:36:20,740
Look, isn't it nice?

924
00:36:21,620 --> 00:36:23,220
Your sister gave it to me.

925
00:36:24,820 --> 00:36:25,860
Block him!

926
00:36:26,260 --> 00:36:28,076
Don't let him through,
he'll take the middle!

927
00:36:28,100 --> 00:36:29,780
Yes, block him! Don't let him pass!

928
00:36:31,100 --> 00:36:32,420
He's going through the middle!

929
00:36:33,460 --> 00:36:34,956
Hurry, he's going through the middle!

930
00:36:34,980 --> 00:36:35,676
Stop him!

931
00:36:35,700 --> 00:36:37,740
No, don't let him shoot!

932
00:36:40,220 --> 00:36:41,236
Where's your dad?

933
00:36:41,260 --> 00:36:42,140
Didn't see him.

934
00:36:43,180 --> 00:36:44,020
Uncle!

935
00:36:45,140 --> 00:36:46,220
- Zhixia.
- Where's my dad?

936
00:36:47,300 --> 00:36:48,940
There, look.

937
00:36:49,140 --> 00:36:50,140
Steady as a rock.

938
00:36:50,980 --> 00:36:52,020
Go find that rock.

939
00:36:52,300 --> 00:36:53,140
Dad!

940
00:36:55,020 --> 00:36:56,020
If no...

941
00:36:56,060 --> 00:36:57,156
- Water, please!
- Thanks, sweetheart.

942
00:36:57,180 --> 00:36:58,100
Thanks.

943
00:36:59,420 --> 00:37:00,756
Why are you sweating so much?

944
00:37:00,780 --> 00:37:01,820
Dad's tired.

945
00:37:05,180 --> 00:37:08,020
You look exhausted, old man.

946
00:37:10,820 --> 00:37:14,060
I've been playing football
for about three hours.

947
00:37:14,620 --> 00:37:15,476
Listen to him brag.

948
00:37:15,500 --> 00:37:16,876
He only played for ten minutes.

949
00:37:16,900 --> 00:37:18,140
And drank two bottles of water.

950
00:37:18,820 --> 00:37:20,340
That's your dad's level of fitness.

951
00:37:21,900 --> 00:37:23,060
Just say what you mean.

952
00:37:23,420 --> 00:37:24,740
Nothing. Jiao,

953
00:37:25,060 --> 00:37:26,740
tell your dad to take care of himself.

954
00:37:26,940 --> 00:37:29,500
After all,
we already lost one son-in-law.

955
00:37:29,860 --> 00:37:30,700
Xu Zhi...

956
00:37:34,020 --> 00:37:35,780
Zhidong's right.

957
00:37:36,740 --> 00:37:38,476
Jiao, what does your school teach?

958
00:37:38,500 --> 00:37:41,396
Develop sports to strengthen
the people's health.

959
00:37:41,420 --> 00:37:42,540
Good.

960
00:37:43,260 --> 00:37:44,236
Give Dad a back massage.

961
00:37:44,260 --> 00:37:45,500
You attack, keep going.

962
00:37:45,700 --> 00:37:46,940
Hit you instead.

963
00:37:47,460 --> 00:37:48,500
Feels good.

964
00:37:48,860 --> 00:37:49,700
Feels good.

965
00:37:49,860 --> 00:37:50,316
Hit harder.

966
00:37:50,340 --> 00:37:51,860
Referee, someone's hitting me!

967
00:37:52,860 --> 00:37:54,540
That tickles, stop it!

968
00:37:57,260 --> 00:37:59,060
You look amazing in that.

969
00:37:59,540 --> 00:38:00,380
Don't I?

970
00:38:01,140 --> 00:38:02,660
I think it's just all right.

971
00:38:03,020 --> 00:38:04,756
It works as pyjamas at home.

972
00:38:04,780 --> 00:38:05,620
Name your price.

973
00:38:06,100 --> 00:38:07,980
If I were rich, I'd just give it to you.

974
00:38:08,580 --> 00:38:10,140
Don't be fake about it.

975
00:38:10,540 --> 00:38:11,780
Let me see how much it is.

976
00:38:13,620 --> 00:38:14,780
(10,234.00)

977
00:38:17,940 --> 00:38:18,596
Fixed it,

978
00:38:18,620 --> 00:38:19,500
half off then.

979
00:38:20,100 --> 00:38:22,340
Feng Meiqi bought it in Shanghai.

980
00:38:22,560 --> 00:38:24,060
It's a limited edition, one of a kind.

981
00:38:24,340 --> 00:38:25,180
Really.

982
00:38:25,660 --> 00:38:27,220
But it really suits you.

983
00:38:27,420 --> 00:38:28,276
How about this,

984
00:38:28,300 --> 00:38:30,540
I'll be generous and give it to you.

985
00:38:31,300 --> 00:38:32,820
Stop pretending to be generous.

986
00:38:33,260 --> 00:38:34,340
I'll send you five thousand.

987
00:38:35,380 --> 00:38:36,220
Deal.

988
00:38:38,700 --> 00:38:39,540
Transfer's done.

989
00:38:40,860 --> 00:38:42,340
Then I'll buy gold bars for the baby.

990
00:38:48,820 --> 00:38:49,780
Try it on for me.

991
00:38:50,580 --> 00:38:51,420
I try?

992
00:38:52,100 --> 00:38:53,876
I'm the customer, I paid five thousand.

993
00:38:53,900 --> 00:38:55,500
Can't I see how it looks on the seller?

994
00:38:55,700 --> 00:38:56,676
You can, of course.

995
00:38:56,700 --> 00:38:58,180
You paid, you're the boss.

996
00:38:59,460 --> 00:39:00,596
I'll go change in your room.

997
00:39:00,620 --> 00:39:01,036
No.

998
00:39:01,060 --> 00:39:01,610
Just do it here.

999
00:39:01,620 --> 00:39:02,980
Put it on right here.

1000
00:39:04,500 --> 00:39:05,340
All right.

1001
00:39:11,020 --> 00:39:11,860
Your hair.

1002
00:39:12,540 --> 00:39:13,380
Okay.

1003
00:39:13,660 --> 00:39:16,300
Here's your model shot,
what do you think?

1004
00:39:16,940 --> 00:39:17,780
Looks great.

1005
00:39:18,220 --> 00:39:18,916
Keep it then.

1006
00:39:18,940 --> 00:39:19,780
Don't take it off.

1007
00:39:21,060 --> 00:39:22,020
It's yours now.

1008
00:39:22,580 --> 00:39:23,560
You're giving it to me?

1009
00:39:23,980 --> 00:39:26,080
With our relationship,
I'm basically your godmother.

1010
00:39:26,460 --> 00:39:28,660
So, think of it
as a red envelope from your godmother.

1011
00:39:29,340 --> 00:39:30,780
Besides, it looks better on you.

1012
00:39:31,100 --> 00:39:33,196
Look at me, big chest, tiny waist.

1013
00:39:33,220 --> 00:39:34,860
But everything looks flat in this.

1014
00:39:35,100 --> 00:39:37,180
It's fine, you were always quite flat.

1015
00:39:37,500 --> 00:39:38,580
Your belly's even big.

1016
00:39:43,660 --> 00:39:44,500
This one's good.

1017
00:39:45,060 --> 00:39:46,500
I want this "Good Fortune" one.

1018
00:39:46,900 --> 00:39:47,740
Grandma.

1019
00:39:48,180 --> 00:39:50,780
Is your special
sour plum drink ready yet?

1020
00:39:51,740 --> 00:39:53,180
Yes, it's ready.

1021
00:39:54,620 --> 00:39:56,116
Come, Jiao, look.

1022
00:39:56,140 --> 00:39:57,196
Look.

1023
00:39:57,220 --> 00:39:59,020
See what Grandma made for you.

1024
00:40:01,020 --> 00:40:01,860
Try it.

1025
00:40:03,220 --> 00:40:04,116
Slow down.

1026
00:40:04,140 --> 00:40:04,916
It's good.

1027
00:40:04,940 --> 00:40:05,820
Good, isn't it?

1028
00:40:06,100 --> 00:40:07,916
And the pie, is it nice?

1029
00:40:07,940 --> 00:40:08,780
It's delicious.

1030
00:40:09,180 --> 00:40:10,300
Better than pizza?

1031
00:40:10,740 --> 00:40:12,660
A hundred times better than pizza.

1032
00:40:13,060 --> 00:40:14,396
Grandma's food is the best.

1033
00:40:14,420 --> 00:40:16,236
Hear that?

1034
00:40:16,260 --> 00:40:18,356
My girl always tells the truth.

1035
00:40:18,380 --> 00:40:20,540
Yes, children never lie.

1036
00:40:21,520 --> 00:40:23,476
I've told you,
that pizza you always eat outside.

1037
00:40:23,500 --> 00:40:24,836
What's so good about it?

1038
00:40:24,860 --> 00:40:26,236
All the filling's exposed.

1039
00:40:26,260 --> 00:40:28,316
You hold it and your hands
get covered in oil.

1040
00:40:28,340 --> 00:40:29,476
How disgusting is that?

1041
00:40:29,500 --> 00:40:30,196
Right?

1042
00:40:30,220 --> 00:40:32,540
The main thing is you're wasting money.

1043
00:40:33,700 --> 00:40:35,220
It's brother-in-law's money.

1044
00:40:35,240 --> 00:40:37,316
Exactly. If you don't spend
his money, it's wasted.

1045
00:40:37,340 --> 00:40:39,130
Yes, money's useless
if you take it to the grave.

1046
00:40:39,140 --> 00:40:39,756
Dad, let me toast you.

1047
00:40:39,780 --> 00:40:40,356
You child.

1048
00:40:40,380 --> 00:40:42,036
Come.

1049
00:40:42,060 --> 00:40:43,276
Come on, Zhixia.

1050
00:40:43,300 --> 00:40:44,300
Have a pie.

1051
00:40:44,780 --> 00:40:45,700
Here.

1052
00:40:45,820 --> 00:40:48,260
I don't want any.
Your cooking's too salty now.

1053
00:40:48,420 --> 00:40:49,636
Blame the salt seller, then.

1054
00:40:49,660 --> 00:40:50,660
No, I mean, listen.

1055
00:40:50,960 --> 00:40:52,596
You haven't even eaten it
and you say it's salty?

1056
00:40:52,620 --> 00:40:54,060
Didn't you eat the braised beef?

1057
00:40:54,060 --> 00:40:55,180
Dad, let me toast you again.

1058
00:40:55,860 --> 00:40:56,516
All right.

1059
00:40:56,540 --> 00:40:58,196
Okay, Zhixia.

1060
00:40:58,220 --> 00:40:59,156
I'll change.

1061
00:40:59,180 --> 00:41:01,260
I'll change next time, all right, girl?

1062
00:41:06,300 --> 00:41:06,956
Zhixia.

1063
00:41:06,980 --> 00:41:09,100
There's something I wanted to ask you.

1064
00:41:10,180 --> 00:41:11,076
We'd like you

1065
00:41:11,100 --> 00:41:12,620
to book a hotel for us.

1066
00:41:12,820 --> 00:41:14,556
Your dad and I were thinking

1067
00:41:14,580 --> 00:41:17,260
we should invite
Bichen's parents out for dinner.

1068
00:41:18,060 --> 00:41:18,900
Xu Zhidong.

1069
00:41:19,420 --> 00:41:20,716
Congratulations.

1070
00:41:20,740 --> 00:41:22,500
Your parents finally remembered you.

1071
00:41:23,100 --> 00:41:24,300
I could cry.

1072
00:41:25,220 --> 00:41:27,380
Oh, stop it, you.

1073
00:41:27,860 --> 00:41:29,956
How many people? What kind of setup?

1074
00:41:29,980 --> 00:41:31,316
Do her parents
have any dietary restrictions?

1075
00:41:31,340 --> 00:41:31,916
Not really.

1076
00:41:31,940 --> 00:41:33,756
Just light on oil, salt, and spice.

1077
00:41:33,760 --> 00:41:34,716
Her mom doesn't eat coriander.

1078
00:41:34,740 --> 00:41:36,740
All right,
send me the details in a message.

1079
00:41:38,300 --> 00:41:38,756
Yes.

1080
00:41:38,780 --> 00:41:40,036
Yes, listen to your sister.

1081
00:41:40,060 --> 00:41:41,116
Just our two families?

1082
00:41:41,140 --> 00:41:42,500
Yes, just the two families.

1083
00:41:42,860 --> 00:41:43,900
As for the dishes,

1084
00:41:44,100 --> 00:41:45,836
you can decide, balance it out.

1085
00:41:45,860 --> 00:41:47,260
Just follow what he said,

1086
00:41:47,420 --> 00:41:49,140
what your brother mentioned.

1087
00:41:49,980 --> 00:41:50,820
Right.

1088
00:41:51,660 --> 00:41:52,980
You all don't worry about it.

1089
00:41:53,140 --> 00:41:54,060
I'll pay.

1090
00:41:55,020 --> 00:41:56,436
You said it yourself.

1091
00:41:56,460 --> 00:41:57,596
Yes, I did.

1092
00:41:57,620 --> 00:41:59,260
Mom's money shouldn't go to waste.

1093
00:41:59,980 --> 00:42:01,196
What's it got to do with you?

1094
00:42:01,220 --> 00:42:02,350
Come on, Dad, let me toast you.

1095
00:42:03,380 --> 00:42:04,940
Then I'll book a big feast.

1096
00:42:05,820 --> 00:42:06,860
Go ahead and book it.

1097
00:42:08,260 --> 00:42:10,260
They've raised Bichen so well.

1098
00:42:10,860 --> 00:42:12,940
Even if we served dragon meat,
it wouldn't be enough.

1099
00:42:13,740 --> 00:42:14,276
Zhixia.

1100
00:42:14,300 --> 00:42:16,196
Just book it at Lijun Hotel.

1101
00:42:16,220 --> 00:42:17,260
What Lijun?

1102
00:42:18,140 --> 00:42:19,340
Let's just go with Nanxi Hotel.

1103
00:42:19,820 --> 00:42:22,140
Their staff have sales targets to meet.

1104
00:42:22,460 --> 00:42:24,500
We might as well
help Shen Mingzhu out a bit.

1105
00:42:26,540 --> 00:42:27,380
Good.

1106
00:42:27,660 --> 00:42:28,940
That's a great idea.

1107
