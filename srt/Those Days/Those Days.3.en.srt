00:01:12,431 --> 00:01:14,800
(Adapted from iceread.com novel
"You Xi" by Qingyang Wanxi)

3
00:01:15,220 --> 00:01:17,900
=Episode 3=

4
00:01:20,800 --> 00:01:22,479
This is Nanzhou Police Department,

5
00:01:22,479 --> 00:01:23,520
Nanhu Precinct.

6
00:01:23,880 --> 00:01:25,800
Are you Yu Jingxiang's daughter?

7
00:01:26,440 --> 00:01:27,240
Yes, that's me.

8
00:01:28,640 --> 00:01:29,720
I told you.

9
00:01:29,720 --> 00:01:31,679
I told you she was.

10
00:01:31,679 --> 00:01:33,600
I'm an officer of Nanhu Precinct.

11
00:01:33,600 --> 00:01:35,279
Yu Jingxiang is in our station now.

12
00:01:36,199 --> 00:01:37,160
Let me ask you again,

13
00:01:37,559 --> 00:01:39,119
are you Yu Jingxiang's daughter?

14
00:01:40,240 --> 00:01:41,479
Yes, I am.

15
00:01:41,800 --> 00:01:43,000
See?

16
00:01:43,319 --> 00:01:44,000
Honey,

17
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:46,039
didn't I transfer you the money?

18
00:01:46,039 --> 00:01:47,119
I want to see you.

19
00:01:47,119 --> 00:01:47,839
Mom...

20
00:01:49,119 --> 00:01:49,919
I'm warning you,

21
00:01:50,199 --> 00:01:51,240
the station is currently

22
00:01:51,240 --> 00:01:53,360
verifying all your
identification records.

23
00:01:53,720 --> 00:01:55,440
If we find out you've
used a false identity

24
00:01:55,440 --> 00:01:56,560
or impersonated someone else,

25
00:01:57,199 --> 00:01:59,319
you'll be charged with fraud.

26
00:01:59,759 --> 00:02:02,000
We'll open a formal investigation
according to the law.

27
00:02:02,440 --> 00:02:03,240
Do you understand?

28
00:02:05,800 --> 00:02:07,039
I'll ask you one last time,

29
00:02:07,759 --> 00:02:09,440
are you Yu Jingxiang's daughter?

30
00:02:12,160 --> 00:02:12,839
Honey,

31
00:02:13,520 --> 00:02:14,679
say something!

32
00:02:14,919 --> 00:02:16,679
Say something!

33
00:02:16,860 --> 00:02:18,599
You scammed Yu Jingxiang
out of 3,000 yuan.

34
00:02:18,879 --> 00:02:20,410
You're going to
pay it back right now.

35
00:02:24,320 --> 00:02:27,080
You're my daughter! I know it!

36
00:02:28,080 --> 00:02:29,119
Mom, this is their stuff!

37
00:02:29,119 --> 00:02:29,920
This is their stuff!

38
00:02:29,920 --> 00:02:30,879
It's their phone!

39
00:02:30,879 --> 00:02:32,760
I'm sorry!

40
00:02:32,760 --> 00:02:33,999
Let's go to the supermarket, Mom!

41
00:02:33,999 --> 00:02:35,250
There's a discount for the eggs.

42
00:02:35,399 --> 00:02:36,320
Let's go buy some eggs.

43
00:02:36,320 --> 00:02:36,920
Come on.

44
00:02:37,119 --> 00:02:38,119
Easy there.

45
00:02:50,320 --> 00:02:50,960
Hi, Mr. Feng.

46
00:02:51,599 --> 00:02:52,320
Hi, Mingzhu.

47
00:02:52,320 --> 00:02:53,279
Have a seat.

48
00:02:53,279 --> 00:02:53,839
Okay.

49
00:02:54,399 --> 00:02:55,119
Come, sit.

50
00:02:56,839 --> 00:02:57,719
Have some tea.

51
00:02:58,399 --> 00:02:59,520
It's fine, sir.

52
00:03:00,999 --> 00:03:02,320
I heard from Director Zhao

53
00:03:02,320 --> 00:03:03,520
that you've moved all
your reception business

54
00:03:03,520 --> 00:03:05,360
to our Nanxi Hotel.

55
00:03:05,640 --> 00:03:06,760
I really appreciate that.

56
00:03:07,520 --> 00:03:08,879
I wasn't sure what to bring,

57
00:03:08,879 --> 00:03:10,080
so I got you some tea.

58
00:03:10,080 --> 00:03:11,520
Jianqi said you're a tea lover.

59
00:03:13,520 --> 00:03:14,420
Come on, we're family.

60
00:03:14,430 --> 00:03:15,279
You shouldn't have.

61
00:03:15,599 --> 00:03:16,760
Don't do this again next time.

62
00:03:18,520 --> 00:03:20,200
I'm sorry for the other day.

63
00:03:20,520 --> 00:03:22,320
My brother was a little harsh.

64
00:03:22,510 --> 00:03:24,320
He made things awkward
for you and Mrs. Feng.

65
00:03:26,399 --> 00:03:28,520
We should've been more
considerate that day.

66
00:03:29,570 --> 00:03:31,420
A happy occasion got derailed
by heated words.

67
00:03:31,999 --> 00:03:33,480
Please talk to your parents

68
00:03:33,719 --> 00:03:34,480
and calm them down.

69
00:03:36,240 --> 00:03:38,360
I'll speak with Jianqi's mom too.

70
00:03:38,760 --> 00:03:39,679
Her temper isn't great.

71
00:03:39,680 --> 00:03:40,910
I hope for your understanding.

72
00:03:42,320 --> 00:03:43,640
Anyway, this wedding

73
00:03:43,640 --> 00:03:46,200
has to be both respectable and grand.

74
00:03:46,660 --> 00:03:48,760
Honestly, I don't mind what
kind of wedding we have.

75
00:03:49,080 --> 00:03:51,480
As my mom always says,
"A moment of glory

76
00:03:51,480 --> 00:03:53,370
isn't as important as
a lifetime of stability."

77
00:03:53,879 --> 00:03:54,960
Your mom is right.

78
00:03:56,920 --> 00:03:58,360
But then again,

79
00:03:58,719 --> 00:03:59,399
Mingzhu,

80
00:03:59,920 --> 00:04:01,080
I've been in business

81
00:04:01,080 --> 00:04:02,240
for years.

82
00:04:02,679 --> 00:04:04,200
I have friends,

83
00:04:04,640 --> 00:04:05,480
leaders,

84
00:04:05,480 --> 00:04:07,520
contacts from all walks
of life to consider.

85
00:04:08,119 --> 00:04:10,260
We have to put on a event
that reflects well on us.

86
00:04:10,879 --> 00:04:12,439
Don't worry, leave everything to me.

87
00:04:12,879 --> 00:04:14,480
Lijun Hotel is massive.

88
00:04:14,480 --> 00:04:15,879
It can host over a hundred tables.

89
00:04:16,080 --> 00:04:18,240
You must invite
all your relatives and friends.

90
00:04:19,119 --> 00:04:20,640
That puts me at ease.

91
00:04:21,279 --> 00:04:22,640
I'll let Jianqi know right away.

92
00:04:23,760 --> 00:04:24,650
Here, have some water.

93
00:04:24,679 --> 00:04:25,240
Here.

94
00:04:26,479 --> 00:04:27,399
How is Jianqi?

95
00:04:27,760 --> 00:04:28,640
He's doing great.

96
00:04:28,880 --> 00:04:30,320
He's even gained weight.

97
00:04:32,200 --> 00:04:33,200
Focus on your work.

98
00:04:37,290 --> 00:04:39,000
Well, someone's feeling
generous after that feast.

99
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:40,530
Now you're out here
doing good deeds.

100
00:04:40,640 --> 00:04:41,479
Oh, hardly.

101
00:04:41,599 --> 00:04:43,520
That whole bottle of water is his.

102
00:04:43,640 --> 00:04:44,440
Drink more then.

103
00:04:44,960 --> 00:04:45,960
Drink more.

104
00:04:46,650 --> 00:04:47,799
That meal was just too rich.

105
00:05:05,479 --> 00:05:06,039
Hello.

106
00:05:06,799 --> 00:05:07,479
Honey,

107
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:10,159
want to go swimming tonight?

108
00:05:10,719 --> 00:05:12,399
What's with the sudden urge to swim?

109
00:05:15,239 --> 00:05:17,479
I feel like I'm soaking
in brine right now.

110
00:05:17,680 --> 00:05:19,719
I need a dip to dilute it a bit.

111
00:05:31,320 --> 00:05:32,120
Still salty?

112
00:05:32,880 --> 00:05:35,039
Not at all. It's sweet now.

113
00:05:35,599 --> 00:05:36,599
Want a taste?

114
00:05:46,080 --> 00:05:47,399
Tell you what, let's have a race.

115
00:05:47,840 --> 00:05:49,450
I'll give you a three-length head start.

116
00:05:49,640 --> 00:05:50,880
You think you can outswim me?

117
00:05:50,880 --> 00:05:51,560
Let's try it.

118
00:05:52,599 --> 00:05:53,399
I'll start then.

119
00:05:55,640 --> 00:05:57,000
That's two body lengths.

120
00:05:58,440 --> 00:05:59,399
That's three!

121
00:06:00,039 --> 00:06:00,880
I'm coming!

122
00:06:21,170 --> 00:06:22,359
What's the point of all this?

123
00:06:23,320 --> 00:06:25,599
This is the price for
abandoning a child

124
00:06:25,599 --> 00:06:26,239
Dad.

125
00:06:27,599 --> 00:06:29,279
Mom is already heartbroken.

126
00:06:30,039 --> 00:06:31,239
That's enough.

127
00:06:43,239 --> 00:06:44,560
Try not to take it so hard.

128
00:06:45,479 --> 00:06:47,960
My little sister was given
away almost 30 years ago.

129
00:06:48,919 --> 00:06:50,520
She can't be found so quickly.

130
00:06:50,520 --> 00:06:51,520
It's just going to

131
00:06:52,039 --> 00:06:54,039
take some time. Isn't it?

132
00:06:54,839 --> 00:06:57,200
I lie awake night after night.

133
00:06:59,359 --> 00:07:01,039
The moment I close my eyes,

134
00:07:01,479 --> 00:07:05,640
I can hear the baby

135
00:07:06,399 --> 00:07:08,680
crying and crying.

136
00:07:11,960 --> 00:07:13,719
Your dad is right.

137
00:07:14,960 --> 00:07:16,560
This is my punishment.

138
00:07:16,880 --> 00:07:18,599
My karma.

139
00:07:19,560 --> 00:07:20,200
Mom.

140
00:07:21,399 --> 00:07:24,039
But you weren't the one
who gave her away.

141
00:07:24,520 --> 00:07:26,359
- It was Grandma.
- No, it wasn't her fault.

142
00:07:26,359 --> 00:07:28,440
It wasn't your grandmother's fault.

143
00:07:29,399 --> 00:07:32,120
When I was pregnant with your sister,

144
00:07:33,399 --> 00:07:37,039
my work unit was going through layoffs.

145
00:07:37,479 --> 00:07:40,039
You know how I am.

146
00:07:40,479 --> 00:07:42,479
I was so proud.

147
00:07:43,320 --> 00:07:46,760
I was terrified that having a child
would affect my work,

148
00:07:46,760 --> 00:07:48,599
that they would let me go.

149
00:07:50,919 --> 00:07:51,799
Then...

150
00:07:53,520 --> 00:07:55,000
When I found out

151
00:07:55,599 --> 00:07:57,560
I was having twins,

152
00:07:57,560 --> 00:07:58,440
I thought,

153
00:07:59,320 --> 00:08:02,039
"It's impossible. How will we manage?"

154
00:08:03,159 --> 00:08:04,159
I was so worried.

155
00:08:05,039 --> 00:08:06,799
I told your grandmother,

156
00:08:08,440 --> 00:08:09,919
"We can't raise them both.

157
00:08:09,919 --> 00:08:12,880
How could we possibly manage?

158
00:08:13,680 --> 00:08:17,200
If a good family wanted a child,

159
00:08:17,560 --> 00:08:19,799
we could give one away."

160
00:08:20,279 --> 00:08:21,919
I think your grandmother

161
00:08:24,159 --> 00:08:25,799
took me seriously.

162
00:08:29,159 --> 00:08:30,160
And back then, your dad...

163
00:08:30,180 --> 00:08:31,520
Your dad was getting into trouble.

164
00:08:31,520 --> 00:08:32,560
He got into a fight,

165
00:08:32,560 --> 00:08:33,799
the police arrested him,

166
00:08:33,799 --> 00:08:35,440
and he was sent to prison for years.

167
00:08:37,520 --> 00:08:38,200
Mom...

168
00:08:38,200 --> 00:08:39,919
Mom, please don't be like this.

169
00:08:40,200 --> 00:08:41,560
Don't overthink it.

170
00:08:41,919 --> 00:08:43,519
Now...

171
00:08:44,400 --> 00:08:45,630
Right now, what matters most is

172
00:08:45,630 --> 00:08:47,580
that we give it our all
to find my sister, okay?

173
00:08:48,680 --> 00:08:49,719
Yes.

174
00:08:49,920 --> 00:08:50,560
Yes.

175
00:08:50,759 --> 00:08:52,599
We have to find your sister.

176
00:08:52,800 --> 00:08:54,239
We have to...

177
00:08:56,440 --> 00:08:57,400
But even if we do,

178
00:08:58,999 --> 00:09:02,200
then what?

179
00:09:03,560 --> 00:09:05,160
What if she doesn't want to see me?

180
00:09:05,759 --> 00:09:08,759
She probably hates me.

181
00:09:08,759 --> 00:09:10,359
I should die.

182
00:09:10,359 --> 00:09:11,599
Oh, my gosh! Mom!

183
00:09:11,599 --> 00:09:12,440
Mom...

184
00:09:12,440 --> 00:09:13,239
I should die.

185
00:09:13,239 --> 00:09:14,639
You're scaring me, Mom!

186
00:09:14,839 --> 00:09:15,719
I should die.

187
00:09:15,719 --> 00:09:18,200
Mom, I'm still pregnant.

188
00:09:23,119 --> 00:09:23,999
Oh, yes.

189
00:09:24,200 --> 00:09:24,800
You're right.

190
00:09:24,800 --> 00:09:26,119
It's okay, honey.

191
00:09:26,119 --> 00:09:28,440
I'm okay now.

192
00:09:28,680 --> 00:09:29,800
I'm okay.

193
00:09:29,800 --> 00:09:31,160
You should go home.

194
00:09:31,160 --> 00:09:32,320
Jiao...

195
00:09:32,320 --> 00:09:34,359
Jiao is waiting for you to come home.

196
00:09:34,519 --> 00:09:35,359
I'm okay now.

197
00:09:36,160 --> 00:09:37,080
I'm okay.

198
00:09:37,080 --> 00:09:38,440
Go home.

199
00:09:39,479 --> 00:09:41,759
I'm okay.

200
00:09:45,560 --> 00:09:46,759
Please enjoy your food.

201
00:09:50,040 --> 00:09:52,440
(Alipay payment received, 3,000 yuan.)

202
00:09:52,440 --> 00:09:53,359
Got your salary?

203
00:09:53,360 --> 00:09:55,710
I transferred it to you immediately,
didn't even touch it.

204
00:09:56,479 --> 00:09:57,960
Is your 1,000 yuan monthly allowance

205
00:09:57,960 --> 00:09:58,999
enough?

206
00:09:59,440 --> 00:10:00,719
Since you're being so good,

207
00:10:01,040 --> 00:10:01,960
I'll give you a raise.

208
00:10:01,960 --> 00:10:02,639
No need.

209
00:10:03,359 --> 00:10:04,400
I just top up my phone,

210
00:10:04,400 --> 00:10:05,359
I don't use credit,

211
00:10:05,360 --> 00:10:07,460
I eat lunch in the cafeteria,
dinner with my parents.

212
00:10:07,639 --> 00:10:08,879
I can buy you a few milk teas,

213
00:10:08,879 --> 00:10:10,359
get you flowers on holidays.

214
00:10:12,200 --> 00:10:12,999
Rhyming, huh?

215
00:10:16,719 --> 00:10:17,519
You're so annoying.

216
00:10:20,639 --> 00:10:21,119
Hello.

217
00:10:21,119 --> 00:10:22,639
Where are you, Xu Zhidong?

218
00:10:22,840 --> 00:10:23,599
Mom's been scammed.

219
00:10:23,599 --> 00:10:25,320
She's in really bad shape. Come home now.

220
00:10:26,960 --> 00:10:28,519
Okay, I got it.

221
00:10:33,320 --> 00:10:34,200
What's wrong?

222
00:10:34,999 --> 00:10:35,719
Nothing.

223
00:10:35,720 --> 00:10:37,639
My sister says Mom's
not doing well emotionally.

224
00:10:37,639 --> 00:10:38,879
Go home now.

225
00:10:38,970 --> 00:10:40,879
Don't worry about this,
I'll pack everything up.

226
00:10:40,879 --> 00:10:41,440
Go!

227
00:10:41,440 --> 00:10:42,160
Are you sure?

228
00:10:43,430 --> 00:10:44,560
I bought the groupon coupon.

229
00:10:44,560 --> 00:10:45,759
I'll send it to you later.

230
00:10:46,200 --> 00:10:46,960
Zhidong.

231
00:10:46,960 --> 00:10:47,639
Yes?

232
00:10:48,200 --> 00:10:49,400
Don't ride too fast.

233
00:11:02,400 --> 00:11:03,040
Zhixia.

234
00:11:03,359 --> 00:11:04,800
What took you so long?

235
00:11:04,800 --> 00:11:06,239
I was eating with Bichen.

236
00:11:06,239 --> 00:11:07,080
I left as soon

237
00:11:07,080 --> 00:11:07,960
as I got your call.

238
00:11:07,960 --> 00:11:08,879
I didn't wait.

239
00:11:08,960 --> 00:11:10,879
You could've just told me
on the phone.

240
00:11:10,879 --> 00:11:12,040
I wouldn't dare.

241
00:11:12,350 --> 00:11:14,320
If Bichen dumps me,
you have take responsibility.

242
00:11:14,320 --> 00:11:16,070
Right, I have to take responsibility
for everything.

243
00:11:16,080 --> 00:11:17,599
I'm your sister, not your mother.

244
00:11:17,599 --> 00:11:19,040
You're just a mother to me.

245
00:11:20,359 --> 00:11:21,920
How's Mom doing?

246
00:11:22,639 --> 00:11:23,239
Same as before.

247
00:11:23,239 --> 00:11:25,450
Sighing nonstop, looking
like she's lost the will to live.

248
00:11:25,960 --> 00:11:26,960
Listen,

249
00:11:27,280 --> 00:11:28,800
you'd better keep an eye on her.

250
00:11:29,160 --> 00:11:30,879
She gave you all her pension money.

251
00:11:30,880 --> 00:11:31,920
If she does something stupid,

252
00:11:31,920 --> 00:11:32,639
we'll both be motherless,

253
00:11:32,639 --> 00:11:33,950
and you'll be broke on top of that.

254
00:11:33,960 --> 00:11:35,719
I've got to go. Jiao's waiting
for me to have dinner.

255
00:11:35,719 --> 00:11:36,759
Take care on your way back.

256
00:11:37,359 --> 00:11:38,280
Keep an eye on her.

257
00:11:38,280 --> 00:11:39,040
You hear me?

258
00:11:39,040 --> 00:11:39,639
Got it.

259
00:11:41,320 --> 00:11:42,160
Thanks.

260
00:11:49,239 --> 00:11:49,999
Sweetheart,

261
00:11:52,800 --> 00:11:54,920
I've never asked you this.

262
00:11:57,759 --> 00:11:59,359
Do you resent your birth parents?

263
00:12:03,639 --> 00:12:04,479
No, I don't.

264
00:12:08,560 --> 00:12:09,999
If they hadn't given me away,

265
00:12:10,410 --> 00:12:12,080
I wouldn't have
a wonderful mom like you.

266
00:12:17,920 --> 00:12:19,320
You should...

267
00:12:19,519 --> 00:12:20,800
Leave this to me.

268
00:12:20,800 --> 00:12:24,239
Jianqi and Minghui are painting.

269
00:12:24,400 --> 00:12:26,479
Take the strawberries you
just washed over to them.

270
00:12:33,080 --> 00:12:33,960
Hey, Minghui,

271
00:12:34,800 --> 00:12:36,800
did you add salt in my lunch?

272
00:12:37,759 --> 00:12:38,599
Feng Jianqi,

273
00:12:39,160 --> 00:12:40,999
don't you dare make
baseless accusations.

274
00:12:41,140 --> 00:12:43,760
If you keep slandering me like this,
I'll sue you for defamation.

275
00:12:47,200 --> 00:12:47,920
Minghui.

276
00:12:48,560 --> 00:12:48,920
What?

277
00:12:48,920 --> 00:12:51,200
Don't mistake my kindness for weakness.

278
00:12:51,519 --> 00:12:53,040
Let me tell you, people your size

279
00:12:53,040 --> 00:12:54,599
are easy to take down.

280
00:12:56,599 --> 00:12:57,440
Feng Jianqi,

281
00:12:58,460 --> 00:13:00,400
you're the one who's
been crashing at our place

282
00:13:00,599 --> 00:13:01,879
and hogging my room.

283
00:13:02,440 --> 00:13:03,479
And you want to hit me?

284
00:13:04,040 --> 00:13:04,759
Come on then.

285
00:13:04,759 --> 00:13:06,320
Hit me here. Come on.

286
00:13:06,320 --> 00:13:07,200
Hit me.

287
00:13:07,200 --> 00:13:08,280
Come on.

288
00:13:08,280 --> 00:13:09,320
You think I wouldn't?

289
00:13:09,560 --> 00:13:10,599
He wouldn't, but I would.

290
00:13:13,839 --> 00:13:14,960
I know you would.

291
00:13:16,320 --> 00:13:18,040
Don't mind him. Here, have a strawberry.

292
00:13:21,400 --> 00:13:22,200
Sweet?

293
00:13:22,920 --> 00:13:23,719
So sweet.

294
00:13:24,719 --> 00:13:27,320
Right, too sweet.

295
00:13:28,119 --> 00:13:29,800
I want some too, Mingzhu.

296
00:13:29,800 --> 00:13:31,440
Go wash some from the fridge yourself.

297
00:13:32,479 --> 00:13:33,599
Shen Mingzhu!

298
00:13:34,479 --> 00:13:37,040
You're ditching your
brother for your man already?

299
00:13:37,040 --> 00:13:38,320
Choosing a guy over family?

300
00:13:38,320 --> 00:13:38,999
So what?

301
00:13:40,639 --> 00:13:41,519
You're the worst!

302
00:13:46,839 --> 00:13:49,080
Notice anything different
about me today?

303
00:13:51,560 --> 00:13:52,440
Did you get handsomer?

304
00:13:53,280 --> 00:13:54,759
No, on me.

305
00:13:55,160 --> 00:13:56,560
Something on me. Look closer.

306
00:14:00,119 --> 00:14:01,680
You can search me.

307
00:14:02,280 --> 00:14:04,040
Hey, where are you touching?

308
00:14:04,719 --> 00:14:05,999
In my pocket.

309
00:14:10,879 --> 00:14:11,960
This is for me?

310
00:14:12,400 --> 00:14:14,040
I saw it while I was
out shopping today.

311
00:14:14,519 --> 00:14:16,040
It's nothing expensive,

312
00:14:16,759 --> 00:14:17,920
but it's meaningful.

313
00:14:18,200 --> 00:14:19,759
The ad said,

314
00:14:20,400 --> 00:14:21,920
"In sync with you every second."

315
00:14:22,320 --> 00:14:23,280
I love you

316
00:14:23,999 --> 00:14:24,920
every second.

317
00:14:25,599 --> 00:14:26,479
I love you too.

318
00:14:28,200 --> 00:14:29,200
Put it on me.

319
00:14:29,400 --> 00:14:30,080
Okay.

320
00:14:31,759 --> 00:14:32,400
Here.

321
00:14:36,599 --> 00:14:37,160
Okay.

322
00:14:38,320 --> 00:14:38,960
Come on.

323
00:14:39,320 --> 00:14:41,479
Couple watches. Do you like it?

324
00:14:42,440 --> 00:14:43,759
Look at the second hand.

325
00:14:43,759 --> 00:14:45,599
They tick in perfect sync.

326
00:14:45,599 --> 00:14:46,479
Exactly the same.

327
00:14:46,550 --> 00:14:48,320
That's why they call it
"in sync with you."

328
00:14:50,200 --> 00:14:50,960
This is nice.

329
00:14:55,040 --> 00:14:55,719
Bao.

330
00:14:56,440 --> 00:14:57,320
What are you doing?

331
00:14:59,599 --> 00:15:01,080
Are you abusing the animal?

332
00:15:02,160 --> 00:15:03,440
Get up. Have some strawberries.

333
00:15:04,080 --> 00:15:04,960
Want some?

334
00:15:05,280 --> 00:15:05,839
Here.

335
00:15:06,440 --> 00:15:07,200
Hold it.

336
00:15:14,160 --> 00:15:15,280
What's your name?

337
00:15:18,080 --> 00:15:20,560
Should we call you Little Hui?

338
00:15:22,200 --> 00:15:23,519
You're mine now.

339
00:15:59,519 --> 00:16:00,359
Where are you going?

340
00:16:00,680 --> 00:16:01,960
What is this?

341
00:16:01,970 --> 00:16:03,280
- What is this for?
- Don't move.

342
00:16:03,280 --> 00:16:04,359
Stay still.

343
00:16:06,239 --> 00:16:07,080
What is this for?

344
00:16:07,519 --> 00:16:09,519
I was worried you'd do something stupid.

345
00:16:09,680 --> 00:16:11,639
You pulled it so hard.

346
00:16:12,800 --> 00:16:14,920
It's cutting off my circulation.
Don't whine.

347
00:16:18,440 --> 00:16:19,680
Are you worried about me?

348
00:16:21,280 --> 00:16:22,800
Well, do you even need to ask?

349
00:16:23,759 --> 00:16:24,680
You think I'm crazy?

350
00:16:26,440 --> 00:16:27,359
Xu Dacheng,

351
00:16:28,400 --> 00:16:30,639
can't you ever just talk nicely?

352
00:16:41,479 --> 00:16:42,119
Zhidong?

353
00:16:43,359 --> 00:16:44,080
Zhidong?

354
00:16:44,480 --> 00:16:45,440
What are you doing here?

355
00:16:47,320 --> 00:16:48,160
What are you doing?

356
00:16:48,160 --> 00:16:48,800
Mom.

357
00:16:48,800 --> 00:16:49,560
What's wrong?

358
00:16:52,680 --> 00:16:53,200
Nothing.

359
00:16:53,210 --> 00:16:54,780
I was worried you'd do something stupid.

360
00:16:54,800 --> 00:16:57,080
Dad and I have to watch you together.

361
00:17:01,920 --> 00:17:02,800
Alright now.

362
00:17:03,759 --> 00:17:04,920
Go back to your room.

363
00:17:05,080 --> 00:17:06,359
Sleep in your room.

364
00:17:06,359 --> 00:17:07,680
It's okay, I'm not tired.

365
00:17:08,160 --> 00:17:09,119
Just go to bed.

366
00:17:09,119 --> 00:17:10,200
I'm really not tired.

367
00:17:11,280 --> 00:17:12,960
Alright, honey.

368
00:17:13,599 --> 00:17:14,559
I'm okay now.

369
00:17:14,759 --> 00:17:16,039
I've thought it through.

370
00:17:17,799 --> 00:17:19,640
I have to live.

371
00:17:20,680 --> 00:17:22,680
I have to live well
and find your second sister.

372
00:17:23,279 --> 00:17:24,600
Just for my second sister?

373
00:17:25,680 --> 00:17:27,319
And you guys too, of course.

374
00:17:27,319 --> 00:17:28,759
I have to stay alive and live well.

375
00:17:29,200 --> 00:17:30,559
If I died,

376
00:17:32,519 --> 00:17:34,479
your dad would just find another wife.

377
00:17:34,660 --> 00:17:36,759
Men in their fifties and
sixties can still have kids.

378
00:17:36,759 --> 00:17:38,759
And now the three-child
policy's open anyway.

379
00:17:39,039 --> 00:17:42,440
Why are you spouting nonsense
early in the morning?

380
00:17:42,440 --> 00:17:43,640
Tell me I'm wrong.

381
00:17:43,640 --> 00:17:44,840
Of course you're wrong.

382
00:17:45,200 --> 00:17:47,559
It's not just fifties or sixties,

383
00:17:47,960 --> 00:17:49,960
men can still have kids at eighty.

384
00:17:51,920 --> 00:17:53,200
Proud of it, huh?

385
00:17:53,600 --> 00:17:54,799
Aren't you tired?

386
00:17:56,360 --> 00:17:57,600
Alright, go to bed.

387
00:17:57,600 --> 00:17:59,640
- Where are you going?
- I'm going to make breakfast.

388
00:17:59,640 --> 00:18:00,960
Go back to bed.

389
00:18:00,960 --> 00:18:01,840
I'm coming with you.

390
00:18:01,960 --> 00:18:03,160
- Come on.
- Let's go together.

391
00:18:03,160 --> 00:18:03,680
Come on.

392
00:18:05,100 --> 00:18:07,740
(Nanzhou Elementary School)

393
00:18:22,680 --> 00:18:23,360
Lu Bing,

394
00:18:23,680 --> 00:18:24,880
a little red flower for you.

395
00:18:29,279 --> 00:18:30,440
What are you up to this time?

396
00:18:30,519 --> 00:18:31,680
And a tiny snake.

397
00:18:32,079 --> 00:18:33,960
Lu Bing, you're scaring it.

398
00:18:33,960 --> 00:18:35,120
It's scaring me!

399
00:18:35,120 --> 00:18:35,960
Get it away from me!

400
00:18:35,960 --> 00:18:36,600
Try to touch it.

401
00:18:36,600 --> 00:18:37,840
Shen Minghui, stay away from me!

402
00:18:37,840 --> 00:18:38,450
It doesn't bite.

403
00:18:38,450 --> 00:18:39,440
I'm warning you, go away!

404
00:18:39,450 --> 00:18:40,060
It's obedient.

405
00:18:41,200 --> 00:18:42,600
Are you okay?

406
00:18:44,360 --> 00:18:45,319
Just you wait!

407
00:18:46,239 --> 00:18:47,920
She's mad.

408
00:18:59,440 --> 00:19:00,319
Shen Minghui!

409
00:19:23,880 --> 00:19:24,559
Honey,

410
00:19:24,960 --> 00:19:26,960
you know what's special about chives?

411
00:19:27,600 --> 00:19:29,079
What's so special about chives?

412
00:19:29,440 --> 00:19:30,519
Don't you get it?

413
00:19:30,799 --> 00:19:32,039
With you, I'm stir-fried!

414
00:19:35,440 --> 00:19:36,559
I saw it online.

415
00:19:39,759 --> 00:19:40,640
What time is it now?

416
00:19:43,440 --> 00:19:44,519
It's five twenty.

417
00:19:44,519 --> 00:19:45,760
You know what that means, right?

418
00:19:46,200 --> 00:19:47,519
From now on, I'm going to ask you

419
00:19:47,519 --> 00:19:48,680
at this time every day.

420
00:19:49,360 --> 00:19:50,640
Feng Jianqi,

421
00:19:51,319 --> 00:19:52,640
you're so gross.

422
00:19:53,279 --> 00:19:54,479
"Five twenty," my foot.

423
00:19:55,039 --> 00:19:57,120
You're a total idiot.

424
00:19:57,120 --> 00:19:58,920
Want me to give you another beating?

425
00:19:59,039 --> 00:20:00,559
See? I didn't even do anything to him.

426
00:20:00,820 --> 00:20:01,559
Just bear with it.

427
00:20:01,559 --> 00:20:02,479
Where's my soda?

428
00:20:03,840 --> 00:20:04,920
I gave it to Jianqi.

429
00:20:05,680 --> 00:20:06,559
Feng Jianqi!

430
00:20:07,200 --> 00:20:08,540
Who said you could drink my Coke?

431
00:20:08,560 --> 00:20:09,880
What's the big deal? I bought it.

432
00:20:09,880 --> 00:20:11,279
Why shouldn't Jianqi have some?

433
00:20:11,280 --> 00:20:12,850
There's a whole case of it right there.

434
00:20:13,120 --> 00:20:15,079
That's not the same! Mine was chilled!

435
00:20:15,750 --> 00:20:17,519
Mingzhu, why are you
always taking his side?

436
00:20:17,519 --> 00:20:18,960
Go upstairs and do your homework.

437
00:20:19,719 --> 00:20:20,759
Leave me alone!

438
00:20:22,260 --> 00:20:23,840
He's always looking for a fight with me.

439
00:20:24,200 --> 00:20:25,640
Just be the bigger person.

440
00:20:28,079 --> 00:20:28,719
Honey,

441
00:20:30,160 --> 00:20:32,039
Do you know what chopsticks symbolize?

442
00:20:32,440 --> 00:20:33,759
Chopsticks have a meaning too?

443
00:20:35,160 --> 00:20:36,510
What does one chopstick represent?

444
00:20:37,559 --> 00:20:38,239
Being single?

445
00:20:38,680 --> 00:20:39,440
And two?

446
00:20:42,160 --> 00:20:42,960
No idea.

447
00:20:43,160 --> 00:20:44,719
A perfect pair, just like you and me.

448
00:20:44,719 --> 00:20:46,319
Shen Minghui! Shen Minghui, come out!

449
00:20:46,600 --> 00:20:47,279
Where is he?

450
00:20:49,560 --> 00:20:50,479
Who are you looking for?

451
00:20:50,479 --> 00:20:51,479
What do you want?

452
00:20:53,239 --> 00:20:54,079
What do you want?

453
00:20:54,079 --> 00:20:55,160
Who are you looking for?

454
00:20:57,050 --> 00:20:58,600
Bully Lu Bing again, and I'll kill you!

455
00:20:58,600 --> 00:20:59,799
Why did you hit him?

456
00:21:00,680 --> 00:21:01,880
Are you okay, Jianqi?

457
00:21:02,640 --> 00:21:03,279
Jianqi?

458
00:21:03,380 --> 00:21:04,559
I thought it was Shen Minghui?

459
00:21:04,759 --> 00:21:05,279
Yes.

460
00:21:05,279 --> 00:21:05,759
Dude,

461
00:21:05,759 --> 00:21:06,880
did you hit the wrong person?

462
00:21:15,200 --> 00:21:16,120
Keep the bowls steady.

463
00:21:16,960 --> 00:21:18,120
Wipe that smirk off your face.

464
00:21:18,600 --> 00:21:19,880
Want me to punish you more?

465
00:21:21,479 --> 00:21:22,719
Why are you giving him water?

466
00:21:22,999 --> 00:21:24,239
He's thirsty!

467
00:21:24,340 --> 00:21:25,920
What's the point of the punishment then?

468
00:21:26,799 --> 00:21:29,039
But we can't let him get dehydrated!

469
00:21:29,680 --> 00:21:30,759
Where are you going?

470
00:21:30,970 --> 00:21:32,840
The Qiao family ordered
ten jin of pork chops.

471
00:21:32,840 --> 00:21:33,799
I'm delivering them.

472
00:21:33,799 --> 00:21:34,479
You should stay.

473
00:21:34,479 --> 00:21:35,319
Don't you move.

474
00:21:35,319 --> 00:21:35,960
No, I mean,

475
00:21:35,960 --> 00:21:37,360
I'll go instead. They had a new baby.

476
00:21:37,360 --> 00:21:39,039
I haven't given them the red envelope.

477
00:21:39,799 --> 00:21:41,319
Mom, I'll go with you.

478
00:21:42,120 --> 00:21:42,759
Sure.

479
00:21:42,759 --> 00:21:43,880
I'll go with Mom.

480
00:21:43,880 --> 00:21:44,360
Okay.

481
00:21:44,360 --> 00:21:46,039
Jianqi, I'm going out with Mom.

482
00:21:46,039 --> 00:21:47,200
I'll be back soon.

483
00:21:47,880 --> 00:21:48,600
Got it!

484
00:21:48,880 --> 00:21:49,239
Hey,

485
00:21:49,239 --> 00:21:50,160
tuck your legs in.

486
00:21:50,519 --> 00:21:51,680
Closer.

487
00:21:52,880 --> 00:21:53,999
Hold it steady, steady now.

488
00:21:56,519 --> 00:21:57,440
All you do

489
00:21:58,759 --> 00:21:59,880
is causing trouble.

490
00:22:01,039 --> 00:22:01,799
Don't move.

491
00:22:02,999 --> 00:22:03,920
I'm watching you.

492
00:22:39,640 --> 00:22:41,039
Landlady,

493
00:22:41,440 --> 00:22:44,920
why is there no water?

494
00:22:48,079 --> 00:22:48,759
Minghui?

495
00:22:50,160 --> 00:22:50,840
Minghui?

496
00:22:52,440 --> 00:22:53,279
Are you there?

497
00:22:53,920 --> 00:22:54,719
What is it, Jianqi?

498
00:22:54,719 --> 00:22:56,319
I'm out of hot water.

499
00:22:56,319 --> 00:22:57,600
Can you take a look for me?

500
00:22:57,600 --> 00:22:58,759
Out of hot water?

501
00:22:59,559 --> 00:23:00,600
Let me see.

502
00:23:02,880 --> 00:23:03,559
Jianqi,

503
00:23:04,880 --> 00:23:06,719
you took a beating for me today.

504
00:23:07,120 --> 00:23:07,999
That's real loyalty.

505
00:23:09,279 --> 00:23:10,640
How about I give you a present?

506
00:23:12,840 --> 00:23:15,239
I'm counting on you, Little Hui.

507
00:23:17,279 --> 00:23:18,600
Avenge me.

508
00:23:18,999 --> 00:23:19,840
You got this.

509
00:23:20,279 --> 00:23:20,920
Go.

510
00:23:21,600 --> 00:23:22,920
Here's the hot water, Jianqi!

511
00:23:27,120 --> 00:23:29,319
No! Go away!

512
00:23:30,880 --> 00:23:32,400
There's a snake in here!

513
00:23:32,400 --> 00:23:33,039
Minghui!

514
00:23:33,479 --> 00:23:34,120
Minghui!

515
00:23:36,039 --> 00:23:36,680
Minghui!

516
00:23:36,840 --> 00:23:38,239
Open the door! I'm scared of snakes!

517
00:23:38,239 --> 00:23:38,960
Minghui!

518
00:23:40,559 --> 00:23:41,440
Open the door!

519
00:23:41,880 --> 00:23:43,920
(A baby girl born on March 26)

520
00:23:44,239 --> 00:23:45,360
(was placed for adoption)

521
00:23:45,380 --> 00:23:47,680
(due to special circumstances
at the Yujia Town Hospital.)

522
00:23:47,690 --> 00:23:50,360
(A family search is now being
conducted through an online platform.)

523
00:23:50,360 --> 00:23:52,200
The clues are too little.

524
00:23:52,880 --> 00:23:54,160
How can we possibly find her?

525
00:23:54,519 --> 00:23:56,079
You don't know that. Publish it first.

526
00:23:56,880 --> 00:23:57,519
Go ahead.

527
00:23:59,559 --> 00:24:00,960
You know, if my sister was adopted

528
00:24:01,360 --> 00:24:03,200
by a wealthy family

529
00:24:03,200 --> 00:24:04,360
and has a great life,

530
00:24:04,799 --> 00:24:06,960
she might ignore our post
even if she sees it.

531
00:24:07,519 --> 00:24:09,079
But if her life has been hard,

532
00:24:09,759 --> 00:24:11,759
she'd definitely come

533
00:24:11,760 --> 00:24:12,640
to confront my parents.

534
00:24:12,640 --> 00:24:15,200
She'd demand to know
why they gave her away.

535
00:24:15,200 --> 00:24:16,960
Should we still post it then?
I can delete it.

536
00:24:16,960 --> 00:24:17,840
No, don't delete it.

537
00:24:17,840 --> 00:24:19,360
I was just thinking out loud.

538
00:24:21,020 --> 00:24:22,920
Even if finding her
brings nothing but trouble,

539
00:24:23,440 --> 00:24:25,120
it's trouble our family deserves.

540
00:24:27,559 --> 00:24:29,799
Let's sleep. We have
a lot to do tomorrow.

541
00:24:30,039 --> 00:24:31,239
You're pregnant.

542
00:24:31,239 --> 00:24:33,039
You should really cut
back on your workload.

543
00:24:34,200 --> 00:24:35,600
Thank you for your concern, Hao.

544
00:24:35,600 --> 00:24:37,079
Now, be a dear and turn off the light.

545
00:24:44,799 --> 00:24:45,479
Honey,

546
00:24:46,239 --> 00:24:48,759
do you want a boy or a girl?

547
00:24:49,640 --> 00:24:51,440
I want a promotion and a raise.

548
00:24:52,220 --> 00:24:54,460
(Teacher's Office)

549
00:24:55,319 --> 00:24:57,440
This is Shen Minghui's
midterm exam paper.

550
00:24:57,719 --> 00:24:58,559
Take a look.

551
00:25:06,600 --> 00:25:08,200
His luck is just terrible.

552
00:25:08,260 --> 00:25:10,950
Even just picking C all the way
should have gotten him a few points.

553
00:25:13,120 --> 00:25:15,799
Tell me, was Shen Minghui adopted?

554
00:25:16,799 --> 00:25:17,960
Your dad wouldn't come

555
00:25:17,960 --> 00:25:18,960
to the school,

556
00:25:18,960 --> 00:25:19,960
and you, as his sister,

557
00:25:19,960 --> 00:25:21,860
can still make jokes
after seeing his results.

558
00:25:22,279 --> 00:25:23,479
If this is

559
00:25:23,479 --> 00:25:24,460
how your family

560
00:25:24,470 --> 00:25:26,759
treat his education,
then we have nothing more to discuss.

561
00:25:26,759 --> 00:25:28,039
No, Mr. Sun, I didn't mean that.

562
00:25:28,440 --> 00:25:31,279
He's been in high school for five years.

563
00:25:31,600 --> 00:25:33,239
He's been a senior for nearly three.

564
00:25:33,360 --> 00:25:35,079
The curriculum is exactly the same,

565
00:25:35,440 --> 00:25:37,840
but his grades aren't getting better,

566
00:25:37,840 --> 00:25:38,999
they're getting worse.

567
00:25:39,079 --> 00:25:39,759
Why?

568
00:25:41,360 --> 00:25:43,880
He just hasn't been in the right
headspace for studying lately.

569
00:25:43,960 --> 00:25:44,960
That's putting it mildly.

570
00:25:45,450 --> 00:25:46,960
He's not "out of the right headspace,"

571
00:25:47,479 --> 00:25:49,079
he has no headspace for it at all.

572
00:25:51,400 --> 00:25:52,079
Of course,

573
00:25:52,519 --> 00:25:54,680
he's very active in other areas.

574
00:25:55,440 --> 00:25:56,479
What other areas?

575
00:25:59,120 --> 00:26:00,759
He brought a snake to school

576
00:26:00,920 --> 00:26:02,400
and nearly scared Lu Bing to death.

577
00:26:02,680 --> 00:26:03,759
Do you know who Lu Bing is?

578
00:26:03,759 --> 00:26:05,759
She's our top student

579
00:26:05,799 --> 00:26:07,960
She got into a top-tier
university last year

580
00:26:07,960 --> 00:26:08,759
but didn't go.

581
00:26:08,760 --> 00:26:09,880
She's repeating her final year

582
00:26:09,880 --> 00:26:12,050
specifically to aim for
Tsinghua or Peking University.

583
00:26:13,039 --> 00:26:14,960
Wow, that's quite the gap between them.

584
00:26:16,200 --> 00:26:17,759
But don't worry, Mr. Sun,

585
00:26:17,999 --> 00:26:19,960
the situation with Lu Bing
has been resolved.

586
00:26:20,799 --> 00:26:21,600
Resolved? How?

587
00:26:22,079 --> 00:26:24,279
Lu Bing's brother came
over with some guys

588
00:26:24,840 --> 00:26:26,600
and beat up Minghui's brother-in-law.

589
00:26:26,850 --> 00:26:28,239
Even though they got the wrong guy,

590
00:26:28,239 --> 00:26:29,920
their family got it out of their system.

591
00:26:33,560 --> 00:26:34,560
Good that it's resolved.

592
00:26:35,640 --> 00:26:36,680
Anyway, here's the thing,

593
00:26:36,999 --> 00:26:39,360
we need to fix Minghui's

594
00:26:39,479 --> 00:26:41,160
academic problem immediately.

595
00:26:42,279 --> 00:26:44,279
He's a bright kid.

596
00:26:44,279 --> 00:26:45,239
Yes, he is.

597
00:26:45,240 --> 00:26:47,220
But he can't stay stuck
in his senior year forever.

598
00:26:47,239 --> 00:26:48,160
You're right.

599
00:26:48,519 --> 00:26:49,360
Let's work together,

600
00:26:49,960 --> 00:26:51,719
the school and your family,

601
00:26:51,999 --> 00:26:53,840
to help him make some real progress.

602
00:26:54,079 --> 00:26:55,160
Let's push hard this year

603
00:26:55,160 --> 00:26:56,360
and get his grades up.

604
00:26:56,360 --> 00:26:57,440
Got it. We'll push him.

605
00:27:07,239 --> 00:27:08,200
Mom and Dad.

606
00:27:08,799 --> 00:27:09,719
I'm home.

607
00:27:10,559 --> 00:27:11,400
You're home.

608
00:27:12,559 --> 00:27:13,319
How did it go?

609
00:27:14,640 --> 00:27:15,960
What did the school say?

610
00:27:15,960 --> 00:27:17,200
Let me have some water first.

611
00:27:20,200 --> 00:27:20,880
Easy there.

612
00:27:20,880 --> 00:27:21,640
How did it go?

613
00:27:23,479 --> 00:27:24,600
His teacher said a lot,

614
00:27:24,799 --> 00:27:25,880
but to sum it up,

615
00:27:26,410 --> 00:27:29,160
Nanzhou High School just wants to
get Minghui out as soon as possible.

616
00:27:29,759 --> 00:27:30,759
Out? To where?

617
00:27:30,759 --> 00:27:32,200
To college, of course.

618
00:27:32,440 --> 00:27:34,360
They've had enough of him.

619
00:27:34,360 --> 00:27:35,279
Oh, stop joking.

620
00:27:35,279 --> 00:27:36,120
College?

621
00:27:36,160 --> 00:27:37,680
You think you can
just send him there?

622
00:27:37,680 --> 00:27:39,120
Your family owns
the university now?

623
00:27:39,130 --> 00:27:40,120
You have to pass the exams to get in!

624
00:27:40,120 --> 00:27:41,920
You think I'm talking
about direct admission?

625
00:27:41,930 --> 00:27:43,350
The teachers are desperate.

626
00:27:43,350 --> 00:27:45,279
They said as long as
Minghui's willing to study,

627
00:27:45,279 --> 00:27:46,719
they'll even give him extra tutoring.

628
00:27:47,520 --> 00:27:49,479
No, no, we can't trouble
the teachers like that.

629
00:27:49,479 --> 00:27:51,079
They're busy
with all the graduating students.

630
00:27:51,079 --> 00:27:51,799
Yes.

631
00:27:51,799 --> 00:27:53,940
It's not right for them to
tutor our kid on top of that.

632
00:27:53,950 --> 00:27:56,880
We can't just dump
everything on the school.

633
00:27:56,880 --> 00:27:58,479
That's not right.

634
00:27:58,559 --> 00:27:59,999
Then who do we dump

635
00:27:59,999 --> 00:28:00,799
it on?

636
00:28:04,759 --> 00:28:05,759
It's our family's issue.

637
00:28:05,759 --> 00:28:07,200
We should handle it ourselves,

638
00:28:07,200 --> 00:28:07,759
right?

639
00:28:08,360 --> 00:28:10,559
What does that mean? Dump him on Jianqi?

640
00:28:11,440 --> 00:28:12,279
Good idea.

641
00:28:15,840 --> 00:28:17,640
You want me to tutor Minghui?

642
00:28:18,840 --> 00:28:19,920
His English is the worst.

643
00:28:20,039 --> 00:28:21,400
Start with that.

644
00:28:23,120 --> 00:28:23,799
Honey,

645
00:28:24,319 --> 00:28:24,880
do you realize

646
00:28:24,880 --> 00:28:26,799
your brother's been bullying me?

647
00:28:26,920 --> 00:28:27,759
I know.

648
00:28:28,039 --> 00:28:29,479
Just be the bigger person.

649
00:28:29,920 --> 00:28:31,799
My mom bullies my dad all the time too.

650
00:28:32,319 --> 00:28:33,360
That's different.

651
00:28:33,440 --> 00:28:34,120
Honey,

652
00:28:34,400 --> 00:28:36,880
does your mom put
salt in your dad's lunch?

653
00:28:36,880 --> 00:28:39,160
Does she turn off the hot water
while he's showering?

654
00:28:39,160 --> 00:28:41,120
Does she turn off

655
00:28:41,120 --> 00:28:41,759
the water

656
00:28:41,759 --> 00:28:43,360
and throw a snake in there?

657
00:28:43,479 --> 00:28:45,160
A snake! A live snake!

658
00:28:46,039 --> 00:28:46,920
Honey,

659
00:28:47,120 --> 00:28:48,719
your English is so amazing!

660
00:28:48,719 --> 00:28:49,550
You just switch to it

661
00:28:49,560 --> 00:28:51,430
like it's your native language
when it matters.

662
00:28:52,319 --> 00:28:53,640
Please teach Minghui.

663
00:28:53,999 --> 00:28:54,680
Honey,

664
00:28:55,640 --> 00:28:57,279
hearing you praise me like that

665
00:28:57,279 --> 00:28:58,799
makes me feel blessed,

666
00:28:58,799 --> 00:28:59,999
but tutoring Minghui?

667
00:29:00,400 --> 00:29:01,400
Sorry, that's a no.

668
00:29:03,479 --> 00:29:05,680
Look, just put up with my brother

669
00:29:05,680 --> 00:29:06,559
for now.

670
00:29:06,880 --> 00:29:08,440
When your sister ever bullies me,

671
00:29:08,440 --> 00:29:09,350
I'll put up with it too.

672
00:29:10,060 --> 00:29:12,160
Your sister's not exactly
easy to deal with either.

673
00:29:14,279 --> 00:29:15,079
Okay?

674
00:29:20,200 --> 00:29:21,400
Fine, fine.

675
00:29:21,960 --> 00:29:24,200
But at least make him
get rid of that snake first.

676
00:29:26,559 --> 00:29:27,319
Little Hui.

677
00:29:28,479 --> 00:29:29,120
Go on.

678
00:29:29,759 --> 00:29:30,999
It's not that I don't want you,

679
00:29:31,000 --> 00:29:32,940
it's that Grandma and Grandpa
don't want you anymore.

680
00:29:33,680 --> 00:29:35,680
Go on, get out of here.

681
00:29:38,799 --> 00:29:40,640
I let it go. Happy now?

682
00:29:44,719 --> 00:29:45,759
He looks reluctant.

683
00:29:46,039 --> 00:29:47,120
He didn't want to let it go.

684
00:29:49,060 --> 00:29:50,239
Stay back, it might bite you.

685
00:29:50,239 --> 00:29:51,400
It's not going to bite.

686
00:29:51,519 --> 00:29:52,759
Snakes bite.

687
00:29:59,799 --> 00:30:00,559
Come in.

688
00:30:07,960 --> 00:30:09,840
Alright, what are we studying?

689
00:30:10,760 --> 00:30:11,950
Where's your English textbook?

690
00:30:12,360 --> 00:30:13,239
English...

691
00:30:16,039 --> 00:30:18,160
English book.

692
00:30:22,840 --> 00:30:24,440
Let's see what you've got.

693
00:30:27,759 --> 00:30:29,719
This book is falling apart.

694
00:30:29,719 --> 00:30:31,370
This is what "well-worn
from reading" looks like.

695
00:30:31,799 --> 00:30:32,840
Didn't you know?

696
00:30:32,960 --> 00:30:34,750
Sure, let's wear this
one out a little more.

697
00:30:35,039 --> 00:30:36,680
Sit up straight, feet down.

698
00:30:40,719 --> 00:30:41,799
Open to Unit One.

699
00:30:42,239 --> 00:30:43,719
Read it aloud, let me hear you.

700
00:30:47,719 --> 00:30:48,360
Open your mouth.

701
00:30:48,920 --> 00:30:53,160
"The Art History."

702
00:30:53,160 --> 00:30:54,239
Minghui reads really well.

703
00:30:55,079 --> 00:30:57,400
His English sounds great.

704
00:30:57,640 --> 00:30:59,200
See, he does like to learn.

705
00:30:59,519 --> 00:31:01,079
He just never had the right teacher.

706
00:31:01,079 --> 00:31:03,920
"It's hard to give a..."

707
00:31:04,960 --> 00:31:05,719
What's so funny?

708
00:31:06,680 --> 00:31:07,400
Nothing.

709
00:31:07,400 --> 00:31:09,920
"Precise definition."

710
00:31:10,759 --> 00:31:12,719
Jianqi's English was
great back in college.

711
00:31:12,799 --> 00:31:13,479
Mingzhu.

712
00:31:14,680 --> 00:31:17,479
I felt so relieved when I heard Jianqi

713
00:31:17,479 --> 00:31:18,880
was tutoring your brother.

714
00:31:19,160 --> 00:31:20,450
And the best part is, it's free.

715
00:31:20,559 --> 00:31:22,799
Yes, makes the wallet feel even better.

716
00:31:24,719 --> 00:31:27,200
Is about a foot of space
enough for you two here?

717
00:31:27,200 --> 00:31:28,039
Yes.

718
00:31:28,239 --> 00:31:29,120
I think it's enough.

719
00:31:29,120 --> 00:31:30,120
It's enough.

720
00:31:30,840 --> 00:31:31,880
"Watching..."

721
00:31:32,360 --> 00:31:33,239
Stop.

722
00:31:34,360 --> 00:31:35,239
Listen up.

723
00:31:35,559 --> 00:31:38,360
When an infinitive is the subject,
the verb must be singular.

724
00:31:38,640 --> 00:31:39,319
For example,

725
00:31:39,799 --> 00:31:41,319
"Watching TV is boring."

726
00:31:44,799 --> 00:31:45,479
Jianqi,

727
00:31:47,120 --> 00:31:50,120
I didn't actually set
the little snake free.

728
00:31:51,759 --> 00:31:52,960
I hid it.

729
00:31:55,650 --> 00:31:56,600
Where did you hide it?

730
00:31:57,719 --> 00:31:58,920
Where did I hide it?

731
00:32:00,440 --> 00:32:02,039
I hid it...

732
00:32:02,600 --> 00:32:03,600
I hid it...

733
00:32:04,360 --> 00:32:06,079
Here!

734
00:32:08,840 --> 00:32:09,360
Minghui!

735
00:32:09,360 --> 00:32:10,279
No!

736
00:32:14,600 --> 00:32:15,799
- Shen Minghui!
- Jianqi!

737
00:32:18,039 --> 00:32:18,719
Jianqi!

738
00:32:18,719 --> 00:32:19,279
Minghui!

739
00:32:19,500 --> 00:32:19,840
Jianqi!

740
00:32:20,479 --> 00:32:21,759
- You little brat!
- I got you!

741
00:32:21,880 --> 00:32:23,279
You're asking for a spanking!

742
00:32:23,519 --> 00:32:23,960
Pull me up!

743
00:32:23,960 --> 00:32:25,239
I'm going to teach you a lesson!

744
00:32:25,799 --> 00:32:26,759
You're stuck.

745
00:32:26,759 --> 00:32:27,400
Jianqi,

746
00:32:27,559 --> 00:32:28,690
I can't even save myself now.

747
00:32:28,700 --> 00:32:29,999
You're on your own, I can't help you!

748
00:32:29,999 --> 00:32:30,519
Minghui!

749
00:32:30,799 --> 00:32:31,440
Minghui!

750
00:32:32,239 --> 00:32:32,559
Jianqi!

751
00:32:32,559 --> 00:32:33,920
You're asking for it!

752
00:32:34,559 --> 00:32:35,400
Stop right there!

753
00:32:35,600 --> 00:32:36,960
Climb, Jianqi!

754
00:32:37,039 --> 00:32:38,120
Mom!

755
00:32:38,559 --> 00:32:40,039
Stop right there, Shen Jianqi!

756
00:32:40,039 --> 00:32:40,719
I'm sorry!

757
00:32:40,719 --> 00:32:41,120
Watch it!

758
00:32:41,120 --> 00:32:43,120
Mom, stop chasing me!

759
00:32:43,479 --> 00:32:44,400
You little brat!

760
00:32:44,840 --> 00:32:45,360
Mom!

761
00:32:45,360 --> 00:32:47,079
Why did you have to be so mischievous?

762
00:32:47,410 --> 00:32:48,840
My princess! I'm sorry! Please stop!

763
00:32:48,840 --> 00:32:50,600
Princess, my foot!

764
00:32:51,279 --> 00:32:52,319
Mom, don't come any closer!

765
00:32:52,759 --> 00:32:53,999
Stop chasing me, Mom!

766
00:32:54,279 --> 00:32:54,960
Mom!

767
00:32:55,519 --> 00:32:56,079
Mom!

768
00:32:56,080 --> 00:32:57,400
You're becoming like a three-year-old!

769
00:32:57,400 --> 00:32:58,840
Come any closer, and I'll jump!

770
00:32:58,840 --> 00:33:00,600
Go ahead! Jump!

771
00:33:00,600 --> 00:33:01,950
It's not like you're fast
enough to catch me.

772
00:33:01,960 --> 00:33:02,840
I'm not fast enough?

773
00:33:02,840 --> 00:33:03,799
I'm going to kill you!

774
00:33:03,799 --> 00:33:04,600
I have to run!

775
00:33:04,600 --> 00:33:05,270
Stop right there!

776
00:33:05,280 --> 00:33:05,960
I have to go!

777
00:33:06,079 --> 00:33:07,039
Stop right there!

778
00:33:07,039 --> 00:33:07,920
Run faster if you can!

779
00:33:07,920 --> 00:33:08,999
You little rascal,

780
00:33:09,999 --> 00:33:11,799
are you trying to drive me mad?

781
00:33:13,799 --> 00:33:16,360
Their family is probably
lively and happy right now.

782
00:33:16,519 --> 00:33:18,880
Meanwhile, our place is so
quiet that even the TV echoes.

783
00:33:23,360 --> 00:33:24,239
Maybe

784
00:33:26,640 --> 00:33:27,920
we should pick a day

785
00:33:28,460 --> 00:33:30,239
for both families to sit down
and talk again.

786
00:33:30,440 --> 00:33:31,120
No.

787
00:33:31,840 --> 00:33:33,039
There's nothing to talk about.

788
00:33:33,600 --> 00:33:35,279
It's a power game now.

789
00:33:36,120 --> 00:33:37,120
If we back down,

790
00:33:37,200 --> 00:33:40,319
they'll walk all over us.

791
00:33:40,319 --> 00:33:42,039
But we're a family now.

792
00:33:43,319 --> 00:33:44,120
I just think

793
00:33:45,759 --> 00:33:47,360
we should try to handle things

794
00:33:47,360 --> 00:33:48,559
with a little goodwill.

795
00:33:49,400 --> 00:33:51,440
What do you mean, "a family"?
Since when?

796
00:33:51,440 --> 00:33:52,120
It's ridiculous.

797
00:33:52,650 --> 00:33:54,239
Our families aren't even well-matched.

798
00:33:54,240 --> 00:33:56,560
You think getting a marriage
certificate makes us family?

799
00:33:56,600 --> 00:33:57,759
It's not that simple.

800
00:33:59,759 --> 00:34:01,279
Why are you being so stubborn?

801
00:34:01,279 --> 00:34:03,400
Stubborn? Who's being stubborn?

802
00:34:03,600 --> 00:34:04,759
I'm being stubborn?

803
00:34:06,920 --> 00:34:07,719
I'm just

804
00:34:08,680 --> 00:34:10,759
setting the ground rules straight.

805
00:34:11,759 --> 00:34:14,559
They shouldn't think it's so easy
to marry into our family.

806
00:34:20,999 --> 00:34:21,800
Hello, Mr. Yu.

807
00:34:21,800 --> 00:34:22,840
Could you wait?

808
00:34:22,840 --> 00:34:24,119
I'll coming right away.

809
00:34:25,519 --> 00:34:27,119
Who is it? You're going out?

810
00:34:27,760 --> 00:34:28,760
Mr. Yu is looking for me.

811
00:34:28,760 --> 00:34:30,550
I'm meeting him at Lijun
to discuss business.

812
00:34:31,599 --> 00:34:32,720
I might be late,

813
00:34:32,720 --> 00:34:33,440
don't wait up.

814
00:34:34,559 --> 00:34:35,479
Go to bed first.

815
00:34:47,039 --> 00:34:47,960
Feng Jianqi,

816
00:34:48,960 --> 00:34:50,400
you're so timid.

817
00:34:50,410 --> 00:34:52,240
You don't even fight back
when people hit you.

818
00:34:53,039 --> 00:34:54,599
What did my sister even see in you?

819
00:34:56,639 --> 00:34:57,920
Are you even a man?

820
00:35:06,119 --> 00:35:06,960
Shen Minghui,

821
00:35:07,800 --> 00:35:08,960
I've had enough of you.

822
00:35:09,800 --> 00:35:10,599
You got the guts

823
00:35:11,119 --> 00:35:12,720
for a real man's duel?

824
00:35:14,519 --> 00:35:15,320
What are we doing?

825
00:35:15,720 --> 00:35:16,440
You name it.

826
00:35:18,599 --> 00:35:20,880
Arm wrestling. You dare?

827
00:35:26,920 --> 00:35:27,559
Come on.

828
00:35:28,119 --> 00:35:29,240
Show me

829
00:35:29,240 --> 00:35:30,760
what man-strength you've got.

830
00:35:31,039 --> 00:35:31,960
Don't go easy on me.

831
00:35:33,119 --> 00:35:33,920
Come on.

832
00:35:35,360 --> 00:35:36,240
Did we start?

833
00:35:41,150 --> 00:35:42,119
Put some muscle into it!

834
00:35:51,639 --> 00:35:52,479
Use your strength!

835
00:36:02,920 --> 00:36:03,960
See now?

836
00:36:04,960 --> 00:36:06,750
I've been going easy
on you this whole time.

837
00:36:24,720 --> 00:36:26,360
Huh, the floor's pretty sturdy now.

838
00:36:27,479 --> 00:36:28,840
Shen Minghui, what are you doing?

839
00:36:29,280 --> 00:36:31,479
Be careful! It was just fixed!

840
00:36:32,280 --> 00:36:33,320
Mind your own business!

841
00:36:33,840 --> 00:36:34,999
You looking for a beating?

842
00:36:37,840 --> 00:36:39,280
Only tough when you're with her.

843
00:36:39,479 --> 00:36:41,119
You and I are mortal enemies now!

844
00:36:42,800 --> 00:36:43,999
Honey, you were amazing.

845
00:36:44,599 --> 00:36:45,960
It's time to put him in his place.

846
00:36:46,119 --> 00:36:48,119
Yes! That's the spirit.

847
00:36:48,119 --> 00:36:48,999
Show him who's boss.

848
00:37:14,559 --> 00:37:15,119
Yes!

849
00:37:19,440 --> 00:37:20,119
Hui,

850
00:37:20,599 --> 00:37:21,800
this ride's super steady!

851
00:37:22,320 --> 00:37:23,119
Of course it is.

852
00:37:23,519 --> 00:37:25,039
Is that why you're rocking it so hard?

853
00:37:25,440 --> 00:37:26,880
How's my driving skills?

854
00:37:27,039 --> 00:37:28,960
Pretty good!
I don't feel carsick at all.

855
00:37:29,119 --> 00:37:29,720
Let's go!

856
00:37:30,370 --> 00:37:31,100
Full speed ahead!

857
00:37:31,119 --> 00:37:31,679
Full speed!

858
00:37:38,720 --> 00:37:40,039
Evening, how many of you?

859
00:37:40,079 --> 00:37:40,639
Three.

860
00:37:40,639 --> 00:37:41,880
Okay, this way, please.

861
00:37:42,360 --> 00:37:43,400
A music restaurant.

862
00:37:44,519 --> 00:37:45,760
This place looks expensive.

863
00:37:45,760 --> 00:37:47,119
Don't worry. It's on Hui.

864
00:37:51,559 --> 00:37:52,320
What do you want?

865
00:37:53,119 --> 00:37:54,119
What can I get you?

866
00:37:54,440 --> 00:37:55,320
Beer.

867
00:37:55,559 --> 00:37:56,360
A half-case of beer,

868
00:37:56,360 --> 00:37:57,800
and one soda water. Thanks.

869
00:38:14,479 --> 00:38:15,119
Madam He?

870
00:38:15,679 --> 00:38:16,760
May I help you?

871
00:38:17,519 --> 00:38:18,400
No, I'm good.

872
00:38:18,860 --> 00:38:20,360
Mr. Feng is at that table over there.

873
00:38:20,370 --> 00:38:21,240
Let me take you there.

874
00:38:21,240 --> 00:38:22,039
It's fine.

875
00:38:22,320 --> 00:38:24,119
He's got a guest.
I don't want to interrupt.

876
00:38:24,440 --> 00:38:24,880
Okay.

877
00:38:24,880 --> 00:38:26,599
I'll call you if I need anything.

878
00:38:26,599 --> 00:38:27,039
Okay.

879
00:38:27,039 --> 00:38:27,599
Bye bye.

880
00:38:27,960 --> 00:38:28,519

00:41:44,679 --> 00:41:45,519
Feng Jianqi,

934
00:41:46,360 --> 00:41:47,199
where's your car?

935
00:41:47,519 --> 00:41:48,920
Where's my car?

936
00:41:49,280 --> 00:41:50,199
What does that mean?

937
00:41:50,800 --> 00:41:51,440
Let me tell you,

938
00:41:51,440 --> 00:41:53,519
your car was taken
by your brother-in-law.

939
00:41:53,519 --> 00:41:54,920
He's drinking by the river

940
00:41:54,920 --> 00:41:56,199
with his no-good friends!

941
00:41:58,320 --> 00:41:58,960
Oh...

942
00:42:00,240 --> 00:42:00,800
Minghui

943
00:42:00,800 --> 00:42:02,639
sometimes likes to play jokes on me.

944
00:42:02,880 --> 00:42:04,599
I'll go get the car right now.

945
00:42:04,800 --> 00:42:05,440
Don't bother.

946
00:42:05,639 --> 00:42:07,199
I already drove it home.

947
00:42:08,039 --> 00:42:10,559
Just look at the family
you've married into!

948
00:42:10,559 --> 00:42:12,320
What kind of people are they?

949
00:42:12,320 --> 00:42:12,960
Mom,

950
00:42:13,440 --> 00:42:15,079
I'll have a serious talk with Minghui.

951
00:42:16,079 --> 00:42:17,720
Go ahead, talk all you want.

952
00:42:20,840 --> 00:42:21,519
Mom,

953
00:42:22,199 --> 00:42:24,360
I don't care that you took the car back.

954
00:42:24,800 --> 00:42:26,360
I can bike to work.

955
00:42:27,320 --> 00:42:28,880
But I'm married to Mingzhu now,

956
00:42:28,880 --> 00:42:29,999
and she's pregnant.

957
00:42:31,159 --> 00:42:32,280
To be perfectly honest,

958
00:42:32,800 --> 00:42:33,920
if you can't accept her,

959
00:42:34,119 --> 00:42:35,240
then I'm never coming home.

960
00:42:35,440 --> 00:42:36,559
