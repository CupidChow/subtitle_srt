00:01:12,431 --> 00:01:14,800
(Adapted from iceread.com novel
"You Xi" by Qingyang Wanxi)

3
00:01:15,220 --> 00:01:17,780
=Episode 17=

4
00:01:18,279 --> 00:01:20,880
When my mother gave Mingzhu to you,

5
00:01:20,880 --> 00:01:22,080
she did it behind my back.

6
00:01:22,319 --> 00:01:24,720
When I gave birth to her,
I had a major hemorrhage.

7
00:01:24,759 --> 00:01:27,520
I was lying on that hospital bed,
half-dead.

8
00:01:27,600 --> 00:01:29,039
I really

9
00:01:29,039 --> 00:01:31,640
knew nothing about this.

10
00:01:31,640 --> 00:01:33,440
My mother also told me

11
00:01:33,440 --> 00:01:35,640
she gave you our address.

12
00:01:35,640 --> 00:01:36,440
She told me

13
00:01:36,440 --> 00:01:39,160
the young couple who adopted my child

14
00:01:39,160 --> 00:01:40,039
promised

15
00:01:40,039 --> 00:01:42,960
they'd bring her back to us one day.

16
00:01:42,960 --> 00:01:44,919
But you never came.

17
00:01:44,919 --> 00:01:47,600
My mother couldn't rest in peace
when she died.

18
00:01:47,600 --> 00:01:48,279
That's the truth.

19
00:01:48,279 --> 00:01:49,559
What a fabricated story!

20
00:01:49,559 --> 00:01:50,520
She gave us an address?

21
00:01:50,520 --> 00:01:51,440
What address?

22
00:01:51,440 --> 00:01:52,600
There was no address.

23
00:01:52,600 --> 00:01:53,760
She didn't give us anything.

24
00:01:53,760 --> 00:01:55,426
I was in the hospital
after a miscarriage,

25
00:01:55,448 --> 00:01:56,800
and you had just had twins.

26
00:01:56,800 --> 00:01:57,080
Yes.

27
00:01:57,093 --> 00:01:58,360
Your family was struggling,

28
00:01:58,440 --> 00:01:59,559
so you kept the boy

29
00:01:59,559 --> 00:02:00,600
and gave away the girl.

30
00:02:00,600 --> 00:02:01,130
That's not...

31
00:02:01,137 --> 00:02:02,390
You said we could take her.

32
00:02:02,399 --> 00:02:03,080
And you said,

33
00:02:03,080 --> 00:02:05,919
"Raise her as your own.
Let's never contact each other again."

34
00:02:05,919 --> 00:02:07,160
No, that's not true!

35
00:02:07,160 --> 00:02:09,360
It's not! My mother wouldn't do that.

36
00:02:09,360 --> 00:02:10,999
You can't say that.

37
00:02:10,999 --> 00:02:12,679
That's not what my mother told me.

38
00:02:12,679 --> 00:02:13,960
Not what your mother told you?

39
00:02:13,960 --> 00:02:15,782
Your mother did many
things behind your back.

40
00:02:15,782 --> 00:02:17,871
She gave your daughter
away without your knowledge,

41
00:02:17,871 --> 00:02:18,360
didn't she?

42
00:02:18,404 --> 00:02:20,360
Please stop.

43
00:02:20,360 --> 00:02:21,360
Please just stop.

44
00:02:21,800 --> 00:02:23,800
I'm sorry. This is our fault.

45
00:02:23,960 --> 00:02:25,480
It's all our fault, okay?

46
00:02:25,520 --> 00:02:27,520
I won't say anything more.

47
00:02:28,480 --> 00:02:29,159
Mingzhu.

48
00:02:30,559 --> 00:02:32,080
Please forgive Mommy, okay?

49
00:02:32,320 --> 00:02:34,040
I'm sorry.

50
00:02:34,200 --> 00:02:34,999
What did you say?

51
00:02:35,960 --> 00:02:36,920
What Mommy?

52
00:02:37,040 --> 00:02:38,080
Whose mommy?

53
00:02:38,960 --> 00:02:40,520
The audacity of you.

54
00:02:40,520 --> 00:02:42,520
Thirty years ago,
during the hardest times,

55
00:02:42,520 --> 00:02:43,839
you threw your child away

56
00:02:43,839 --> 00:02:45,320
and never looked back.

57
00:02:45,320 --> 00:02:46,800
We were the ones

58
00:02:46,800 --> 00:02:47,839
who raised her.

59
00:02:47,839 --> 00:02:48,399
You're right.

60
00:02:48,399 --> 00:02:49,399
And 30 years later,

61
00:02:49,399 --> 00:02:51,439
when she finally has a decent life,

62
00:02:51,439 --> 00:02:52,520
you show up to claim her?

63
00:02:52,520 --> 00:02:53,080
That's not...

64
00:02:53,080 --> 00:02:54,559
You want all the benefits
without any of the work!

65
00:02:54,559 --> 00:02:55,839
What do you actually want?

66
00:02:55,839 --> 00:02:56,480
Nothing...

67
00:02:56,480 --> 00:02:57,804
Is it money? Support payments?

68
00:02:57,804 --> 00:03:00,420
Or is it that your son is getting
married and you need the money?

69
00:03:00,471 --> 00:03:02,080
I bet you need money for a wedding!

70
00:03:02,080 --> 00:03:03,893
No! That's not it!

71
00:03:03,893 --> 00:03:04,590
Then what is it?

72
00:03:04,599 --> 00:03:05,640
- That's not it!
- Where have you been

73
00:03:05,640 --> 00:03:07,599
for the last 30 years? Where were you?

74
00:03:07,599 --> 00:03:10,520
It wasn't like that! It wasn't!

75
00:03:10,839 --> 00:03:12,520
Please listen to me.

76
00:03:13,320 --> 00:03:14,439
I didn't personally

77
00:03:14,839 --> 00:03:17,520
give her to you,

78
00:03:18,399 --> 00:03:21,080
and you know that.

79
00:03:21,360 --> 00:03:23,800
Did my mother give you
our address or not?

80
00:03:24,159 --> 00:03:26,719
You know better than I do

81
00:03:28,119 --> 00:03:31,839
who her real mother is.

82
00:03:32,159 --> 00:03:34,679
You know the answer.

83
00:03:35,439 --> 00:03:36,960
Yu Jingxiang!

84
00:03:37,679 --> 00:03:37,960
I...

85
00:03:37,960 --> 00:03:39,040
I'm sorry. I'm her husband.

86
00:03:39,040 --> 00:03:39,599
Come with me.

87
00:03:39,599 --> 00:03:40,439
I...

88
00:03:40,719 --> 00:03:41,119
I...

89
00:03:41,119 --> 00:03:41,839
Look at me.

90
00:03:41,999 --> 00:03:43,040
Look at me!

91
00:03:43,960 --> 00:03:44,719
What are you doing?

92
00:03:45,960 --> 00:03:46,999
What did you promise me?

93
00:03:47,982 --> 00:03:49,480
Do you not want to claim her anymore?

94
00:03:52,159 --> 00:03:53,879
Alright, enough. Let's go home.

95
00:03:54,320 --> 00:03:55,119
Help your mother.

96
00:03:59,320 --> 00:04:00,360
We're sorry about this.

97
00:04:05,159 --> 00:04:06,520
Stop looking. Stop.

98
00:04:15,159 --> 00:04:15,800
Mom.

99
00:04:17,640 --> 00:04:19,919
Is it true what she said just now?

100
00:04:20,204 --> 00:04:21,350
That they left an address?

101
00:04:22,560 --> 00:04:23,799
There was no address.

102
00:04:23,799 --> 00:04:25,599
Really, there wasn't.

103
00:04:29,719 --> 00:04:30,399
Mingzhu...

104
00:04:33,479 --> 00:04:34,799
I'm telling you the truth.

105
00:04:35,440 --> 00:04:36,839
Alright, I got it.

106
00:04:38,320 --> 00:04:39,359
I should go to work.

107
00:04:44,880 --> 00:04:46,719
Maybe you should

108
00:04:47,115 --> 00:04:48,390
just take the day off today?

109
00:04:48,960 --> 00:04:49,839
Rest for a day.

110
00:04:51,960 --> 00:04:52,599
Okay?

111
00:04:55,200 --> 00:04:55,880
It's fine.

112
00:04:56,839 --> 00:04:58,359
I'm going to be a mother myself soon.

113
00:04:58,960 --> 00:05:00,520
I can handle a little turbulence.

114
00:05:04,520 --> 00:05:05,320
I should get going.

115
00:05:06,039 --> 00:05:07,279
Stay safe.

116
00:05:07,839 --> 00:05:08,560
Be careful.

117
00:05:08,640 --> 00:05:09,200
Okay.

118
00:05:29,279 --> 00:05:30,680
Yu Jingxiang,

119
00:05:30,680 --> 00:05:33,039
how many times have I told you?

120
00:05:33,799 --> 00:05:35,440
Zhixia was worried you'd

121
00:05:35,440 --> 00:05:36,479
act impulsively!

122
00:05:36,479 --> 00:05:38,760
She made me swear not to tell you!

123
00:05:39,640 --> 00:05:40,880
And she was right about you.

124
00:05:41,359 --> 00:05:42,599
Why did you go there?

125
00:05:43,648 --> 00:05:45,520
Don't you want to claim
your daughter anymore?

126
00:05:45,520 --> 00:05:46,640
Dad, cut her some slack.

127
00:05:49,399 --> 00:05:50,000
Mom,

128
00:05:50,604 --> 00:05:52,337
maybe we shouldn't force
this relationship.

129
00:05:52,340 --> 00:05:54,790
You're heartbroken, and you're
putting them in a difficult position.

130
00:05:54,804 --> 00:05:55,782
That's crap!

131
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:59,200
Xu Zhidong, your sister was given away

132
00:05:59,560 --> 00:06:01,599
because of you!

133
00:06:05,239 --> 00:06:07,520
I can't acknowledge
my own flesh and blood.

134
00:06:08,799 --> 00:06:10,839
My mother is gone.

135
00:06:10,839 --> 00:06:13,640
After all this time,
you're still cursing her?

136
00:06:13,960 --> 00:06:16,399
I don't want to live anymore!

137
00:06:16,400 --> 00:06:18,030
- I'm going to kill you!
- Look, Xiang...

138
00:06:18,039 --> 00:06:19,560
Let's die together!

139
00:06:19,560 --> 00:06:20,640
- Yu Jingxiang!
- Let's die!

140
00:06:20,640 --> 00:06:21,599
Yu Jingxiang!

141
00:06:21,599 --> 00:06:22,799
- Let's die!
- Listen!

142
00:06:23,560 --> 00:06:24,440
Your mom has gone mad!

143
00:06:25,159 --> 00:06:26,080
- Die!
- Yu Jingxiang!

144
00:06:26,080 --> 00:06:26,719
- Mom!
- Let's die!

145
00:06:26,719 --> 00:06:27,399
Calm down!

146
00:06:27,399 --> 00:06:27,880
Yu Jingxiang!

147
00:06:27,880 --> 00:06:28,320
Dad!

148
00:06:28,320 --> 00:06:28,839
Let go!

149
00:06:28,839 --> 00:06:29,799
Stop!

150
00:06:30,200 --> 00:06:31,200
Dad, hold it!

151
00:06:31,200 --> 00:06:32,279
You can't fight back!

152
00:06:32,440 --> 00:06:33,560
Don't push me!

153
00:06:33,560 --> 00:06:35,359
What's going on now?

154
00:06:35,648 --> 00:06:36,640
Has your mom gone mad?

155
00:06:36,640 --> 00:06:38,760
Dad, Grandpa's fighting with Grandma.

156
00:06:38,760 --> 00:06:39,440
Yu Jingxiang!

157
00:06:39,760 --> 00:06:40,760
Since no one's cooking,

158
00:06:41,239 --> 00:06:42,440
let's go have hotpot instead.

159
00:06:42,919 --> 00:06:43,520
Let's go.

160
00:06:44,640 --> 00:06:45,719
We're having hotpot.

161
00:06:46,640 --> 00:06:47,799
Bye, Grandpa, Grandma.

162
00:06:47,799 --> 00:06:48,960
We're having hotpot!

163
00:06:53,919 --> 00:06:54,599
Let go!

164
00:07:06,799 --> 00:07:08,320
It's so unfair.

165
00:07:08,320 --> 00:07:10,039
You know what she said to me today?

166
00:07:10,279 --> 00:07:11,200
Miss,

167
00:07:11,919 --> 00:07:13,440
you know better than I do

168
00:07:13,599 --> 00:07:15,159
who her real mother is.

169
00:07:15,320 --> 00:07:16,640
You know the answer.

170
00:07:17,159 --> 00:07:18,919
What does "real mother" even mean?

171
00:07:21,200 --> 00:07:22,520
When she was

172
00:07:23,320 --> 00:07:24,799
just a baby,

173
00:07:24,799 --> 00:07:28,479
I was the one who raised her,
through all the hardship!

174
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:31,279
Remember when she was sickly?

175
00:07:31,279 --> 00:07:32,839
I took her out every day...

176
00:07:33,320 --> 00:07:34,719
- Alright now.
- For IV drips.

177
00:07:35,399 --> 00:07:37,560
I couldn't sleep well for nights.

178
00:07:37,839 --> 00:07:38,560
I know.

179
00:07:38,560 --> 00:07:39,520
And you were

180
00:07:39,919 --> 00:07:41,200
so busy with work

181
00:07:41,200 --> 00:07:43,479
because we were poor.

182
00:07:43,960 --> 00:07:45,520
And that's not all,

183
00:07:45,520 --> 00:07:46,680
you know what else she said?

184
00:07:47,080 --> 00:07:48,880
She said she hemorrhaged badly,

185
00:07:48,880 --> 00:07:50,279
and she didn't know her mom

186
00:07:50,279 --> 00:07:51,320
would give her child away.

187
00:07:51,640 --> 00:07:52,520
She didn't know!

188
00:07:52,520 --> 00:07:53,760
Maybe she didn't know at first,

189
00:07:53,770 --> 00:07:55,830
but for 30 years? All these years,
and she never knew?

190
00:07:55,839 --> 00:07:56,479
Yes.

191
00:07:56,599 --> 00:07:58,760
Their family does seem unreliable.

192
00:07:58,919 --> 00:08:00,399
Especially Xu Dacheng.

193
00:08:00,399 --> 00:08:02,560
He's downright shady and
his methods are underhanded.

194
00:08:03,080 --> 00:08:04,919
So we're the ones who raised the child,

195
00:08:04,919 --> 00:08:06,200
and now we're the ones

196
00:08:06,599 --> 00:08:08,960
in the wrong,

197
00:08:08,960 --> 00:08:11,159
like we'd done something terrible.

198
00:08:11,719 --> 00:08:14,200
My poor girl...
If we'd sent her back to them...

199
00:08:14,200 --> 00:08:14,890
You're home, Mingzhu.

200
00:08:14,893 --> 00:08:18,830
They favored boys over girls...
Could she have had a good life?

201
00:08:18,830 --> 00:08:19,660
- That's enough.
- Mom...

202
00:08:19,671 --> 00:08:21,315
Now 30 years have passed,

203
00:08:21,315 --> 00:08:23,000
our life is better,
and she comes to steal my daughter away!

204
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:24,039
Your daughter is back.

205
00:08:24,039 --> 00:08:25,589
How do you think it'll make her feel

206
00:08:25,590 --> 00:08:27,137
by saying all these in front of her?

207
00:08:27,399 --> 00:08:28,960
Mom, please stop crying.

208
00:08:31,799 --> 00:08:33,560
It's just so unfair!

209
00:08:34,280 --> 00:08:35,759
Alright, don't cry.

210
00:08:36,719 --> 00:08:37,320
Mom.

211
00:08:38,680 --> 00:08:39,960
No matter what happens,

212
00:08:40,359 --> 00:08:42,160
you're my only mother.

213
00:08:43,239 --> 00:08:45,359
I'm just so afraid

214
00:08:45,359 --> 00:08:47,040
she'll steal you away.

215
00:08:47,071 --> 00:08:49,360
How am I going to live then?

216
00:08:49,404 --> 00:08:51,019
Your daughter is right here, isn't she?

217
00:08:51,020 --> 00:08:51,839
What are you talking about?

218
00:08:51,839 --> 00:08:53,560
I'm an adult now.

219
00:08:53,560 --> 00:08:55,280
How will I get stolen away?

220
00:08:56,440 --> 00:08:57,639
I only have one mother.

221
00:08:57,639 --> 00:08:58,560
And that's you.

222
00:09:01,879 --> 00:09:03,599
Stop crying now.

223
00:09:10,759 --> 00:09:12,440
Here, have some more water.

224
00:09:18,920 --> 00:09:19,560
Let me take it.

225
00:09:23,920 --> 00:09:24,719
Sweetheart, I...

226
00:09:25,359 --> 00:09:27,800
I was really irrational today.

227
00:09:28,080 --> 00:09:28,839
It's okay.

228
00:09:29,759 --> 00:09:30,479
I know.

229
00:09:34,960 --> 00:09:36,719
They want to get close to me so badly

230
00:09:38,200 --> 00:09:40,680
probably because they
feel they owe me so much.

231
00:09:42,239 --> 00:09:43,040
You see,

232
00:09:43,920 --> 00:09:45,680
Zhixia helped promote our hotel,

233
00:09:46,479 --> 00:09:48,119
which is how I got my double bonus.

234
00:09:49,519 --> 00:09:50,800
Her mother only drops by

235
00:09:51,200 --> 00:09:53,560
with some eggs or braised beef.

236
00:09:54,040 --> 00:09:55,920
She's never said anything inappropriate.

237
00:09:56,359 --> 00:09:57,239
Even her brother

238
00:09:57,879 --> 00:09:59,879
booked his wedding banquet at our hotel

239
00:10:00,519 --> 00:10:02,519
just to support my work.

240
00:10:03,839 --> 00:10:05,719
They've all been so nice.

241
00:10:06,999 --> 00:10:08,599
I can't just give them

242
00:10:08,800 --> 00:10:10,879
the cold shoulder, right?

243
00:10:12,200 --> 00:10:13,119
I know.

244
00:10:13,119 --> 00:10:15,560
It's just

245
00:10:15,560 --> 00:10:16,280
basic manners,

246
00:10:17,479 --> 00:10:18,719
even with strangers.

247
00:10:18,839 --> 00:10:19,800
That's just good manners.

248
00:10:20,359 --> 00:10:21,119
And besides,

249
00:10:22,160 --> 00:10:23,560
it's not like we're short on money.

250
00:10:23,560 --> 00:10:25,719
This bangle alone cost
over a hundred thousand, right?

251
00:10:29,960 --> 00:10:32,359
It's getting late. You should head back.

252
00:10:33,400 --> 00:10:34,320
Minghui,

253
00:10:35,119 --> 00:10:36,200
take your sister home.

254
00:10:36,200 --> 00:10:36,800
Now.

255
00:10:36,848 --> 00:10:38,440
- Get some rest.
- I'm going now.

256
00:10:38,440 --> 00:10:38,879
I'm okay.

257
00:10:38,879 --> 00:10:39,960
Get some rest.

258
00:10:53,160 --> 00:10:53,759
Mingzhu,

259
00:10:54,160 --> 00:10:56,080
what if the Xu family insists
on claiming you?

260
00:10:58,160 --> 00:10:58,839
Honestly,

261
00:10:58,839 --> 00:11:00,599
I don't know either.

262
00:11:01,080 --> 00:11:03,080
I don't know how to face them.

263
00:11:03,515 --> 00:11:06,048
Sometimes, when I think about it,
I feel so much resentment.

264
00:11:06,160 --> 00:11:06,839
How could

265
00:11:06,839 --> 00:11:08,719
they just give away their child?

266
00:11:09,839 --> 00:11:12,639
But then when I see how hard
they're trying to reach out,

267
00:11:12,639 --> 00:11:13,519
to make up for it,

268
00:11:13,871 --> 00:11:15,230
I can't help but soften a little.

269
00:11:16,239 --> 00:11:17,119
Part of me thinks

270
00:11:17,999 --> 00:11:19,999
maybe they really
had no choice back then.

271
00:11:22,599 --> 00:11:25,160
Blood ties are strange like that.

272
00:11:26,999 --> 00:11:28,239
That's not fair.

273
00:11:28,479 --> 00:11:29,440
It's cheating.

274
00:11:42,560 --> 00:11:43,479
You know,

275
00:11:43,759 --> 00:11:46,080
when you were still in Mom's belly,

276
00:11:46,280 --> 00:11:48,204
I used to read
"Journey to the West" to you.

277
00:11:48,680 --> 00:11:50,560
You'd kick my palm

278
00:11:50,560 --> 00:11:51,759
through her stomach.

279
00:11:52,239 --> 00:11:52,960
Whenever I said,

280
00:11:53,320 --> 00:11:54,560
"Here comes the Monkey King",

281
00:11:54,960 --> 00:11:56,239
bam, one kick.

282
00:11:56,920 --> 00:11:57,599
Then I'd say,

283
00:11:57,599 --> 00:11:58,599
"Here comes Pigsy!"

284
00:11:58,599 --> 00:12:00,280
Bam, another one.

285
00:12:00,280 --> 00:12:01,519
It was so fun.

286
00:12:02,839 --> 00:12:05,359
Later, when you were born
and wouldn't stop crying,

287
00:12:05,710 --> 00:12:07,271
Mom and Dad couldn't calm you down.

288
00:12:07,680 --> 00:12:08,879
I'd pick you up and say,

289
00:12:08,879 --> 00:12:09,920
"The Monkey King is here",

290
00:12:10,599 --> 00:12:11,879
and you'd stop crying right away.

291
00:12:11,915 --> 00:12:13,693
No wonder "Journey to the West"

292
00:12:13,693 --> 00:12:14,937
was always my best subject.

293
00:12:17,359 --> 00:12:18,800
So no matter what happens,

294
00:12:19,719 --> 00:12:21,119
blood or no blood,

295
00:12:22,359 --> 00:12:24,440
we're family, for real.

296
00:12:26,200 --> 00:12:27,479
I told Mom today

297
00:12:28,080 --> 00:12:29,400
she'll always be my mother.

298
00:12:30,440 --> 00:12:31,080
And you,

299
00:12:31,871 --> 00:12:33,400
you'll always be my little brother.

300
00:12:34,479 --> 00:12:35,320
Exactly!

301
00:12:35,839 --> 00:12:38,239
People even say we look alike.

302
00:12:38,960 --> 00:12:41,200
We're practically real brothers.

303
00:12:41,320 --> 00:12:42,680
Brothers?

304
00:12:42,920 --> 00:12:44,040
We're brother and sister.

305
00:12:44,719 --> 00:12:46,479
And I don't think we look alike at all.

306
00:12:46,479 --> 00:12:48,160
Aw, come on, don't look down on me.

307
00:12:49,080 --> 00:12:50,320
When the baby grows up,

308
00:12:50,330 --> 00:12:52,250
I'm going to tell him
"Journey to the West" too.

309
00:12:52,440 --> 00:12:54,359
Go on, tell it right now.

310
00:12:54,680 --> 00:12:55,200
So,

311
00:12:55,519 --> 00:12:58,599
once upon a time, there was
a monkey named Monkey King.

312
00:12:59,359 --> 00:13:00,280
And a pig,

313
00:13:00,879 --> 00:13:01,839
you know his name?

314
00:13:01,879 --> 00:13:02,599
Pigsy.

315
00:13:02,839 --> 00:13:04,119
No, it's Shen Mingzhu.

316
00:13:04,239 --> 00:13:05,879
You're the pig!

317
00:13:06,040 --> 00:13:07,200
Do you know who Xuanzang is?

318
00:13:07,879 --> 00:13:09,519
Xuanzang is Yue Xiu'e.

319
00:13:09,519 --> 00:13:11,960
She nags all day long.

320
00:13:12,680 --> 00:13:14,639
And Sandy, that's Shen Shengli.

321
00:13:15,160 --> 00:13:16,719
His whole job is to go buy groceries,

322
00:13:17,080 --> 00:13:18,479
carry the loads,

323
00:13:18,479 --> 00:13:19,599
and chop the vegetables.

324
00:13:20,639 --> 00:13:21,639
What are you then?

325
00:13:21,920 --> 00:13:22,280
Me?

326
00:13:22,759 --> 00:13:24,320
I'm the White Dragon Horse!

327
00:13:25,160 --> 00:13:26,519
Seriously?

328
00:13:26,759 --> 00:13:28,359
I'm going to carry you all on my back.

329
00:13:30,680 --> 00:13:31,639
And your baby...

330
00:13:32,960 --> 00:13:34,239
The baby...

331
00:13:34,239 --> 00:13:35,560
The baby is...

332
00:13:36,160 --> 00:13:36,999
The Spider Demon.

333
00:13:47,460 --> 00:13:51,759
(Good luck on
the college entrance exams.)

334
00:13:51,759 --> 00:13:53,599
Revenue...

335
00:13:56,560 --> 00:13:58,320
72,000.

336
00:13:58,639 --> 00:14:01,400
Gross profit, 0.4.

337
00:14:03,999 --> 00:14:06,040
Four times seven is 28.

338
00:14:08,639 --> 00:14:09,960
Still too little.

339
00:14:14,920 --> 00:14:16,999
Shen Minghui, what are you doing?

340
00:14:17,537 --> 00:14:18,800
I'm checking my calculations.

341
00:14:29,920 --> 00:14:30,759
A restaurant.

342
00:14:31,560 --> 00:14:33,400
Revenue of 72,000.

343
00:14:33,920 --> 00:14:35,639
A gross profit of 40%.

344
00:14:37,759 --> 00:14:38,560
Stand up!

345
00:14:39,115 --> 00:14:40,470
You're calculating profit margins?

346
00:14:41,960 --> 00:14:44,440
Isn't the whole point of math
to apply it to real calculations?

347
00:14:45,200 --> 00:14:46,560
You said that yourself, Mr. Sun.

348
00:14:47,759 --> 00:14:48,359
Fine.

349
00:14:49,239 --> 00:14:50,960
Tell your parents to come
see me tomorrow.

350
00:14:51,479 --> 00:14:52,519
I said that too.

351
00:14:55,320 --> 00:14:56,440
My guardian can't come.

352
00:14:57,479 --> 00:14:58,280
Why?

353
00:14:59,048 --> 00:15:01,110
My brother-in-law is the one
who tutors me at home.

354
00:15:02,839 --> 00:15:03,960
Lately, he's...

355
00:15:05,359 --> 00:15:06,119
On a business trip?

356
00:15:07,040 --> 00:15:07,879
Or is he sick?

357
00:15:08,479 --> 00:15:09,320
I can wait.

358
00:15:11,800 --> 00:15:12,719
He's dead.

359
00:15:16,400 --> 00:15:17,400
Shen Minghui,

360
00:15:17,999 --> 00:15:19,839
how can you curse your family like that?

361
00:15:21,560 --> 00:15:23,239
Poor grades are one thing,

362
00:15:23,239 --> 00:15:24,519
that's an ability problem.

363
00:15:24,560 --> 00:15:26,630
But making up lies like
this is a character problem.

364
00:15:26,630 --> 00:15:27,448
Do you understand?

365
00:15:27,599 --> 00:15:28,359
Mr. Sun,

366
00:15:29,080 --> 00:15:30,599
he's telling the truth.

367
00:15:31,280 --> 00:15:32,519
His brother-in-law was the man

368
00:15:32,519 --> 00:15:34,400
who saved that drowning
child in Nanzhou River.

369
00:15:35,582 --> 00:15:36,870
You can look it up online.

370
00:15:37,479 --> 00:15:38,119
- Yes.
- Yes.

371
00:15:43,719 --> 00:15:44,320
Minghui,

372
00:15:44,320 --> 00:15:45,119
I'm sorry.

373
00:15:45,719 --> 00:15:46,719
I blamed you wrongly.

374
00:15:47,160 --> 00:15:48,359
Come on, sit.

375
00:15:48,639 --> 00:15:49,839
It's okay, Mr. Sun.

376
00:15:54,639 --> 00:15:57,239
No wonder your focus
has been off lately.

377
00:15:57,960 --> 00:15:59,639
I had no idea your family passed.

378
00:16:00,982 --> 00:16:01,920
Here's what we'll do.

379
00:16:02,879 --> 00:16:03,960
Come to the office

380
00:16:04,519 --> 00:16:05,639
every day at noon.

381
00:16:05,760 --> 00:16:07,204
I'll give you some extra tutoring.

382
00:16:07,519 --> 00:16:08,239
Let's work on

383
00:16:08,479 --> 00:16:10,479
getting your grades up.

384
00:16:16,315 --> 00:16:18,026
I'd rather you called my guardian.

385
00:16:19,239 --> 00:16:20,080
What was that?

386
00:16:21,599 --> 00:16:22,999
I said, thank you, Mr. Sun.

387
00:16:26,519 --> 00:16:27,119
Lu Bing,

388
00:16:27,800 --> 00:16:28,759
please hand these out.

389
00:16:31,719 --> 00:16:32,400
Minghui,

390
00:16:33,719 --> 00:16:35,400
come to the office at noon today.

391
00:16:43,560 --> 00:16:44,479
I'll help you.

392
00:16:53,300 --> 00:16:55,500
(Teacher's Office)

393
00:16:56,400 --> 00:16:57,879
Mr. Sun,

394
00:16:58,400 --> 00:16:59,879
when are we going to the cafeteria?

395
00:17:00,471 --> 00:17:01,400
If you don't go soon,

396
00:17:01,400 --> 00:17:02,626
there won't be any food left.

397
00:17:04,560 --> 00:17:05,848
We'll go in a little while.

398
00:17:06,071 --> 00:17:07,848
You get sleepy
if you eat on a full stomach.

399
00:17:08,559 --> 00:17:10,279
How about this, finish this problem,

400
00:17:10,279 --> 00:17:11,200
and then we'll go.

401
00:17:12,759 --> 00:17:13,400
Mr. Sun,

402
00:17:13,400 --> 00:17:14,479
have you eaten?

403
00:17:14,559 --> 00:17:15,239
No.

404
00:17:15,804 --> 00:17:17,360
The line is too long right now.

405
00:17:24,120 --> 00:17:24,960
Shen Minghui,

406
00:17:25,279 --> 00:17:26,640
did you understand

407
00:17:26,880 --> 00:17:28,279
what I just explained to you?

408
00:17:28,759 --> 00:17:29,640
Yes.

409
00:17:30,026 --> 00:17:31,893
Then why did you
still answer it like this?

410
00:17:38,799 --> 00:17:39,559
Shen Minghui,

411
00:17:41,400 --> 00:17:42,799
I'm friends with your sister.

412
00:17:42,799 --> 00:17:44,799
If you ever have any
questions about physics,

413
00:17:44,999 --> 00:17:46,079
you can come to me.

414
00:17:49,999 --> 00:17:50,640
Mr. Hu.

415
00:17:55,120 --> 00:17:56,200
I need to ask you something.

416
00:17:57,719 --> 00:17:59,640
Do you know about his brother-in-law?

417
00:18:01,239 --> 00:18:02,120
I do.

418
00:18:03,200 --> 00:18:06,039
My girlfriend is his
brother-in-law's little sister.

419
00:18:12,120 --> 00:18:13,200
So you're relatives.

420
00:18:14,719 --> 00:18:16,400
Soon-to-be relatives.

421
00:18:17,880 --> 00:18:18,640
Excuse me.

422
00:18:21,360 --> 00:18:22,880
Hello, Meiqi.

423
00:18:23,400 --> 00:18:24,519
I just finished class.

424
00:18:24,640 --> 00:18:25,559
I'm coming.

425
00:18:25,559 --> 00:18:26,120
Wait for me.

426
00:18:27,640 --> 00:18:29,079
I'm leaving, Mr. Sun.

427
00:18:29,079 --> 00:18:29,640
Bye.

428
00:18:36,360 --> 00:18:37,719
Look, Shen Minghui,

429
00:18:38,120 --> 00:18:39,600
I'll starve with you.

430
00:18:39,999 --> 00:18:41,079
Neither of us is eating

431
00:18:41,120 --> 00:18:42,471
until you finish this problem.

432
00:18:45,559 --> 00:18:46,319
Let's eat.

433
00:18:47,079 --> 00:18:48,519
Maybe we should wait for Hu Gang.

434
00:18:48,960 --> 00:18:50,400
It's fine. We can eat without him.

435
00:18:50,880 --> 00:18:52,759
Don't you have
a wedding dress fitting later?

436
00:18:52,840 --> 00:18:53,960
I'm not in a hurry.

437
00:18:55,120 --> 00:18:56,600
Well, I'm starving. I'm eating.

438
00:18:57,640 --> 00:18:59,279
Hu Gang isn't even coming for the food.

439
00:18:59,400 --> 00:19:01,471
He's just upgrading the software
on my computer.

440
00:19:02,239 --> 00:19:04,160
The perks of dating a tech guy.

441
00:19:04,840 --> 00:19:06,680
He could be a bit awkward, but...

442
00:19:07,319 --> 00:19:09,319
"A bit"? Try very.

443
00:19:09,319 --> 00:19:10,880
Very, very awkward, okay?

444
00:19:10,880 --> 00:19:13,239
You can work on molding him a little.

445
00:19:14,200 --> 00:19:16,120
Everyone's got their own personality.

446
00:19:16,120 --> 00:19:16,880
That's normal.

447
00:19:17,559 --> 00:19:18,239
Besides,

448
00:19:18,382 --> 00:19:19,840
it's not like I'm marrying Hu Gang.

449
00:19:20,248 --> 00:19:21,960
I don't even really want to get married.

450
00:19:21,960 --> 00:19:23,426
So why would I try to change him?

451
00:19:23,799 --> 00:19:25,559
What is he to you then?

452
00:19:25,559 --> 00:19:26,400
A shield.

453
00:19:27,600 --> 00:19:29,360
To block my countless aunts

454
00:19:29,360 --> 00:19:31,115
and their overwhelming
matchmaking urges.

455
00:19:31,319 --> 00:19:33,360
And Hu Gang has a great temper.

456
00:19:33,559 --> 00:19:35,640
He can handle all my negative emotions.

457
00:19:36,880 --> 00:19:37,440
But...

458
00:19:38,239 --> 00:19:40,400
isn't that a little unfair to him?

459
00:19:41,120 --> 00:19:41,880
He doesn't mind.

460
00:19:49,079 --> 00:19:49,680
Meiqi.

461
00:19:50,160 --> 00:19:50,559
Sit.

462
00:19:50,559 --> 00:19:51,319
Hi, Bichen.

463
00:19:51,337 --> 00:19:53,440
Sorry, we were starving,
so we started without you.

464
00:19:53,440 --> 00:19:55,648
No, it's my fault for
getting out of class so late.

465
00:19:56,319 --> 00:19:56,920
Excuse me,

466
00:19:56,920 --> 00:19:57,920
we'd like a menu.

467
00:19:57,920 --> 00:19:58,479
Okay.

468
00:19:58,920 --> 00:19:59,559
Thank you.

469
00:20:01,960 --> 00:20:02,719
Mr. Hu.

470
00:20:03,479 --> 00:20:04,519
I can't finish it.

471
00:20:04,519 --> 00:20:05,880
Could you finish it for me?

472
00:20:07,160 --> 00:20:07,880
Of course.

473
00:20:08,039 --> 00:20:08,759
I'm not ordering.

474
00:20:09,840 --> 00:20:10,680
I'll just eat yours.

475
00:20:10,680 --> 00:20:11,279
Thank you.

476
00:20:12,039 --> 00:20:13,279
Have some fruits.

477
00:20:23,039 --> 00:20:23,719
Is it good?

478
00:20:24,239 --> 00:20:24,880
Yes.

479
00:20:28,160 --> 00:20:30,120
The cafeteria food's getting worse.

480
00:20:30,293 --> 00:20:32,382
If you come late, there's
not even anything left.

481
00:20:32,426 --> 00:20:34,440
Just bear with it. We'll graduate soon.

482
00:20:34,960 --> 00:20:37,950
Look, there's someone in their fifth
year of high school still eating here.

483
00:20:38,279 --> 00:20:39,999
Don't say that. I repeated a year too.

484
00:20:39,999 --> 00:20:40,559
Hi, Lu Bing.

485
00:20:42,920 --> 00:20:43,680
Hi, Mr. Sun.

486
00:20:44,519 --> 00:20:45,279
Just eating now?

487
00:20:46,400 --> 00:20:47,279
Mr. Sun,

488
00:20:47,759 --> 00:20:48,360
I told you.

489
00:20:48,360 --> 00:20:49,960
If you come late, there's no food left.

490
00:20:50,239 --> 00:20:51,120
Look at Lu Bing,

491
00:20:51,182 --> 00:20:53,848
she's our star student aiming
for Tsinghua or Peking University!

492
00:20:53,850 --> 00:20:55,982
How is she supposed to get
proper nutrition eating so little?

493
00:20:55,990 --> 00:20:57,826
Aren't you going to do
something about this?

494
00:21:02,279 --> 00:21:03,079
No dishes left?

495
00:21:03,160 --> 00:21:04,360
This is all that's left.

496
00:21:04,559 --> 00:21:05,799
Is this enough?

497
00:21:05,799 --> 00:21:06,880
You guys can't be serious.

498
00:21:07,279 --> 00:21:09,400
These kids are still growing,

499
00:21:09,400 --> 00:21:10,920
especially the seniors,

500
00:21:10,920 --> 00:21:12,400
right in the middle of exam prep!

501
00:21:12,960 --> 00:21:14,440
Can't you just make a little more?

502
00:21:18,600 --> 00:21:19,239
So...

503
00:21:19,719 --> 00:21:20,799
Come early next time.

504
00:21:22,200 --> 00:21:22,920
Go eat now.

505
00:21:22,920 --> 00:21:23,893
See you around, Mr. Sun.

506
00:21:28,360 --> 00:21:29,840
Stop looking. Let's get the food.

507
00:21:30,400 --> 00:21:31,319
There's nothing to eat.

508
00:21:31,999 --> 00:21:34,160
So, please put some gravy on our rice.

509
00:21:43,960 --> 00:21:45,200
Meiqi, you have a good eye.

510
00:21:45,200 --> 00:21:46,715
What do you think of this one?

511
00:21:51,200 --> 00:21:51,789
Bichen,

512
00:21:51,790 --> 00:21:53,715
do they have something
a bit more understated?

513
00:21:53,737 --> 00:21:55,230
This one feels a little heavy to me.

514
00:21:57,319 --> 00:21:59,039
Alright, I'll take another look.

515
00:21:59,640 --> 00:22:00,400
What did she say?

516
00:22:01,319 --> 00:22:02,960
She said it seemed too heavy.

517
00:22:03,920 --> 00:22:05,160
No, it doesn't.

518
00:22:05,160 --> 00:22:07,039
It seems alright to me.

519
00:22:07,440 --> 00:22:08,880
Yes, I agree.

520
00:22:08,915 --> 00:22:10,640
Actually, the one
you're wearing right now

521
00:22:10,640 --> 00:22:11,559
looks great.

522
00:22:11,680 --> 00:22:13,039
It's a designer piece

523
00:22:13,039 --> 00:22:14,120
with an excellent cut.

524
00:22:14,200 --> 00:22:14,600
Really?

525
00:22:14,600 --> 00:22:16,120
All the lace is hand-woven.

526
00:22:16,160 --> 00:22:17,310
Take a look at the detailing.

527
00:22:17,319 --> 00:22:18,640
How much is this one?

528
00:22:18,640 --> 00:22:20,319
If you order today, it's 11,000 yuan

529
00:22:20,319 --> 00:22:21,360
for the set of three.

530
00:22:21,799 --> 00:22:24,440
You can mix and match
between the ceremony gown,

531
00:22:24,440 --> 00:22:26,671
the traditional wedding dress,
and the reception dress.

532
00:22:27,600 --> 00:22:28,200
Okay.

533
00:22:28,999 --> 00:22:30,200
Let's take all three then.

534
00:22:30,840 --> 00:22:32,559
No rush. We'll think about it first.

535
00:22:32,759 --> 00:22:33,039
Sure.

536
00:22:33,039 --> 00:22:33,759
Thank you.

537
00:22:35,519 --> 00:22:36,319
Let's go.

538
00:22:47,920 --> 00:22:48,479
Mom.

539
00:22:50,440 --> 00:22:51,360
You're home.

540
00:22:54,079 --> 00:22:55,160
Why are you eating that?

541
00:22:56,079 --> 00:22:56,999
I'm not very hungry.

542
00:22:57,360 --> 00:22:58,519
This is fine.

543
00:22:58,960 --> 00:23:00,920
Let me cook something for you.
You haven't eaten.

544
00:23:00,920 --> 00:23:01,759
I ate.

545
00:23:01,840 --> 00:23:03,160
I had lunch with Chen.

546
00:23:04,319 --> 00:23:04,920
Alright.

547
00:23:04,920 --> 00:23:05,640
Where's Dad?

548
00:23:06,999 --> 00:23:07,600
He's dead.

549
00:23:07,799 --> 00:23:08,640
Who died?

550
00:23:09,840 --> 00:23:10,400
Dad.

551
00:23:17,479 --> 00:23:18,200
Where's my lunch?

552
00:23:20,559 --> 00:23:22,079
Yu Jingxiang, where's my lunch?

553
00:23:22,559 --> 00:23:23,999
I'm your enemy's daughter.

554
00:23:24,226 --> 00:23:26,070
Aren't you worried
I might poison your food?

555
00:23:27,200 --> 00:23:27,920
You're crazy.

556
00:23:30,319 --> 00:23:31,640
You're crazy one.

557
00:23:40,600 --> 00:23:41,160
Mom.

558
00:23:42,680 --> 00:23:43,360
So...

559
00:23:44,360 --> 00:23:46,079
Chen's parents asked me today

560
00:23:47,079 --> 00:23:49,079
about our plan for the wedding.

561
00:23:49,315 --> 00:23:50,782
Like how many guests we're inviting.

562
00:23:51,200 --> 00:23:52,600
What should I tell them?

563
00:23:56,279 --> 00:23:56,960
Oh...

564
00:23:59,600 --> 00:24:02,279
You know what?
You should go ask your dad.

565
00:24:08,960 --> 00:24:09,880
This is too hard.

566
00:24:31,680 --> 00:24:32,360
Meat...

567
00:24:33,960 --> 00:24:34,880
Pork belly...

568
00:24:35,920 --> 00:24:36,640
Rice...

569
00:24:38,279 --> 00:24:39,120
I'm starving.

570
00:24:40,519 --> 00:24:41,120
Come on.

571
00:24:42,360 --> 00:24:43,600
More meat.

572
00:24:45,360 --> 00:24:46,239
More pork belly.

573
00:24:48,519 --> 00:24:49,440
I'm starving.

574
00:25:08,160 --> 00:25:08,999
Zhidong!

575
00:25:09,880 --> 00:25:11,039
Zhidong!

576
00:25:11,310 --> 00:25:12,782
- I'm here.
- Breakfast's ready!

577
00:25:14,759 --> 00:25:15,319
Mom,

578
00:25:15,880 --> 00:25:18,319
it's not just plain boiled eggs today?

579
00:25:18,319 --> 00:25:19,559
This is a feast.

580
00:25:24,337 --> 00:25:25,920
Here, have it with this side dish.

581
00:25:26,640 --> 00:25:28,319
Eat slowly!

582
00:25:28,479 --> 00:25:30,319
You'll choke.

583
00:25:31,200 --> 00:25:32,920
So, how did it go yesterday with Bichen,

584
00:25:33,426 --> 00:25:34,790
trying on the wedding dresses?

585
00:25:35,479 --> 00:25:36,559
How was it?

586
00:25:37,382 --> 00:25:39,315
We checked out three dresses,
and they were nice.

587
00:25:39,319 --> 00:25:41,079
But Bichen thought
they were a bit pricey.

588
00:25:41,093 --> 00:25:42,782
She said she wanted to look online.

589
00:25:47,360 --> 00:25:48,880
You know, Bichen...

590
00:25:49,999 --> 00:25:51,079
She's a nice girl.

591
00:25:51,200 --> 00:25:51,680
Yeah.

592
00:25:51,680 --> 00:25:53,750
You couldn't find another
like her even if you tried.

593
00:25:56,319 --> 00:25:56,920
Dad,

594
00:25:56,960 --> 00:25:58,160
look, Mom specially made you

595
00:25:58,200 --> 00:25:59,680
a whole table of breakfast.

596
00:25:59,680 --> 00:26:00,999
Come on, sit down and have some.

597
00:26:03,999 --> 00:26:04,880
I'm not eating.

598
00:26:07,759 --> 00:26:08,559
Mom.

599
00:26:10,093 --> 00:26:11,070
That's just how Dad is.

600
00:26:11,079 --> 00:26:12,160
Leave him be.

601
00:26:12,520 --> 00:26:13,201
I'll finish it.

602
00:26:14,519 --> 00:26:16,880
Forget it then! So annoying.

603
00:26:19,093 --> 00:26:20,400
And what about the bride price?

604
00:26:20,493 --> 00:26:22,204
When are we going to give it to them?

605
00:26:22,226 --> 00:26:24,293
I feel like Bichen's parents
are getting upset.

606
00:26:27,400 --> 00:26:28,319
Xu Zhidong,

607
00:26:29,120 --> 00:26:30,680
do you have no sense of timing?

608
00:26:32,079 --> 00:26:33,880
With Xu Dacheng acting like this,

609
00:26:34,519 --> 00:26:35,680
if we visit them now,

610
00:26:35,770 --> 00:26:37,200
we'll just make fools of ourselves.

611
00:26:37,200 --> 00:26:39,160
When will you stop this
silent treatment then?

612
00:26:46,840 --> 00:26:47,559
Hi, Chen.

613
00:26:47,799 --> 00:26:49,999
Zhidong, we've set the wedding date.

614
00:26:50,239 --> 00:26:52,880
Have you talked to your mom
about the wedding?

615
00:26:54,920 --> 00:26:56,640
I'm discussing with them right now.

616
00:26:58,319 --> 00:26:59,600
I'll call you back later.

617
00:27:04,500 --> 00:27:09,880
(Zhidong)

618
00:27:09,880 --> 00:27:10,559
Zhixia.

619
00:27:11,279 --> 00:27:11,920
Talk.

620
00:27:13,115 --> 00:27:15,426
Our parents are giving each
other the silent treatment,

621
00:27:15,600 --> 00:27:16,719
Bichen's parents

622
00:27:16,719 --> 00:27:18,479
keep asking about the bride price,

623
00:27:18,479 --> 00:27:19,279
and on top of that,

624
00:27:20,200 --> 00:27:22,519
we haven't booked a venue.

625
00:27:22,880 --> 00:27:24,239
I really don't know what to do.

626
00:27:24,239 --> 00:27:25,840
What am I supposed to tell Bichen?

627
00:27:25,840 --> 00:27:27,840
Could you stop being so dramatic?

628
00:27:28,200 --> 00:27:29,759
I'm pregnant, remember?

629
00:27:30,640 --> 00:27:32,120
I know, but I'm out of options,

630
00:27:32,120 --> 00:27:32,680
Zhixia.

631
00:27:33,400 --> 00:27:34,640
How about I come pick you up?

632
00:27:34,640 --> 00:27:36,039
I'll carry you back if I have to.

633
00:27:36,440 --> 00:27:37,239
Xu Zhidong,

634
00:27:37,559 --> 00:27:39,880
even if you carried me
back on a sedan chair,

635
00:27:39,880 --> 00:27:41,279
I'm still not going.

636
00:27:49,920 --> 00:27:51,519
Dad, Mom,

637
00:27:52,200 --> 00:27:53,719
I brought you medicine!

638
00:27:55,640 --> 00:27:56,920
What medicine?

639
00:27:56,920 --> 00:27:58,920
You could've just brought it in.

640
00:28:03,519 --> 00:28:04,160
Xiang!

641
00:28:06,039 --> 00:28:06,799
Xiang!

642
00:28:09,440 --> 00:28:10,360
What do you want?

643
00:28:18,999 --> 00:28:19,719
Mingzhu?

644
00:28:22,200 --> 00:28:22,840
Mingzhu!

645
00:28:23,479 --> 00:28:23,960
Mingzhu!

646
00:28:23,960 --> 00:28:24,400
Careful!

647
00:28:24,400 --> 00:28:24,999
Mingzhu,

648
00:28:25,279 --> 00:28:26,120
you're here.

649
00:28:27,600 --> 00:28:29,160
- Come inside.
- Come in.

650
00:28:29,319 --> 00:28:30,279
Come inside.

651
00:28:30,279 --> 00:28:31,079
Come on.

652
00:28:31,079 --> 00:28:31,799
Come.

653
00:28:31,799 --> 00:28:32,840
What are you doing here?

654
00:28:32,840 --> 00:28:33,920
Come in.

655
00:28:34,120 --> 00:28:34,759
Come on.

656
00:28:35,360 --> 00:28:36,200
Come.

657
00:28:37,640 --> 00:28:38,600
Sit.

658
00:28:38,600 --> 00:28:39,479
Here.

659
00:28:39,493 --> 00:28:40,310
The place is a mess.

660
00:28:40,319 --> 00:28:41,079
Yes.

661
00:28:41,440 --> 00:28:42,519
- It's okay.
- Come.

662
00:28:42,519 --> 00:28:43,279
Let her sit down.

663
00:28:43,279 --> 00:28:44,360
Come on, girl.

664
00:28:44,479 --> 00:28:45,319
Sit here.

665
00:28:45,319 --> 00:28:45,999
Sit down.

666
00:28:46,120 --> 00:28:46,759
Sit.

667
00:28:46,759 --> 00:28:47,999
Come, sit down.

668
00:28:50,039 --> 00:28:51,920
You can look around.

669
00:29:01,600 --> 00:29:02,239
So,

670
00:29:03,039 --> 00:29:05,120
Zhidong is holding the wedding
at our Nanxi Hotel.

671
00:29:05,239 --> 00:29:06,640
I brought the menu today

672
00:29:06,640 --> 00:29:07,559
for you to look over.

673
00:29:07,920 --> 00:29:08,840
Sure, sure.

674
00:29:08,860 --> 00:29:11,270
I managed to get an approval
from the hotel for a 12% discount.

675
00:29:11,271 --> 00:29:12,550
Oh, no need for a discount!

676
00:29:12,559 --> 00:29:13,200
That's not necessary.

677
00:29:13,200 --> 00:29:15,239
Dad, it's the hotel giving the discount.

678
00:29:15,239 --> 00:29:17,279
Mingzhu isn't paying out
of her own pocket, okay?

679
00:29:17,719 --> 00:29:18,200
That's good.

680
00:29:18,680 --> 00:29:19,319
You're amazing.

681
00:29:19,319 --> 00:29:20,440
Yes, you're awesome.

682
00:29:20,440 --> 00:29:21,319
So awesome.

683
00:29:21,319 --> 00:29:22,239
That's right.

684
00:29:22,239 --> 00:29:22,799
Yes.

685
00:29:23,600 --> 00:29:24,360
Mingzhu.

686
00:29:25,120 --> 00:29:25,799
Thank you.

687
00:29:26,200 --> 00:29:27,279
You're welcome.

688
00:29:29,079 --> 00:29:29,680
Mom.

689
00:29:30,079 --> 00:29:31,640
Mingzhu brought you something.

690
00:29:32,319 --> 00:29:32,960
What thing?

691
00:29:32,960 --> 00:29:33,479
Yes.

692
00:29:34,079 --> 00:29:35,719
I brought you something.

693
00:29:36,840 --> 00:29:37,319
You...

694
00:29:37,719 --> 00:29:38,600
Mingzhu,

695
00:29:39,239 --> 00:29:41,200
we're happy enough

696
00:29:41,200 --> 00:29:42,640
that you came visit.

697
00:29:42,880 --> 00:29:44,759
You really didn't have to.

698
00:29:44,880 --> 00:29:46,960
You talked to the hotel for us,

699
00:29:46,960 --> 00:29:48,400
and got us a discount.

700
00:29:48,400 --> 00:29:50,600
We're supposed to be giving you gifts.

701
00:29:50,600 --> 00:29:51,840
That's right, we should.

702
00:29:51,840 --> 00:29:52,400
Yes.

703
00:29:52,400 --> 00:29:53,759
No, you misunderstood.

704
00:29:53,999 --> 00:29:56,079
This is actually from my mom.

705
00:29:56,640 --> 00:29:57,799
About what happened that day,

706
00:29:57,999 --> 00:30:00,039
she realized she went too far
after she got home.

707
00:30:00,680 --> 00:30:03,920
So, she thought she should give you
some supplements for your health.

708
00:30:06,479 --> 00:30:07,039
Okay.

709
00:30:09,279 --> 00:30:09,960
Mingzhu,

710
00:30:10,360 --> 00:30:11,519
are you thirsty?

711
00:30:11,840 --> 00:30:13,440
Are you hungry?

712
00:30:13,519 --> 00:30:14,440
I'll make you some tea.

713
00:30:14,460 --> 00:30:16,120
- Why are you sitting there?
- Make her something to drink.

714
00:30:16,120 --> 00:30:18,160
Go make some tea.

715
00:30:18,160 --> 00:30:19,559
I'll get you something to drink.

716
00:30:19,559 --> 00:30:20,600
Please wait here.

717
00:30:20,600 --> 00:30:22,204
I'm going to get you some food.

718
00:30:22,204 --> 00:30:22,750
Wait here.

719
00:30:22,999 --> 00:30:24,400
Don't eat it on your own.

720
00:30:24,400 --> 00:30:24,920
Here.

721
00:30:25,239 --> 00:30:26,799
Mingzhu, try this.

722
00:30:27,319 --> 00:30:28,559
Let's see.

723
00:30:29,680 --> 00:30:30,680
Jealous?

724
00:30:31,360 --> 00:30:32,239
Feeling unfair?

725
00:30:32,960 --> 00:30:33,880
I'm used to it.

726
00:30:34,039 --> 00:30:34,719
Mingzhu,

727
00:30:35,048 --> 00:30:36,110
this happens all the time.

728
00:30:36,680 --> 00:30:37,559
Move.

729
00:30:37,799 --> 00:30:38,400
Legs up.

730
00:30:39,880 --> 00:30:40,559
Here.

731
00:30:40,559 --> 00:30:41,920
Try these dates.

732
00:30:43,479 --> 00:30:44,200
What is this?

733
00:30:44,200 --> 00:30:45,039
You can't eat this.

734
00:30:45,039 --> 00:30:46,440
Move, move.

735
00:30:46,600 --> 00:30:48,120
Mingzhu,

736
00:30:48,239 --> 00:30:50,039
our fruits aren't fresh enough.

737
00:30:50,160 --> 00:30:52,279
I'll just peel you a cucumber.

738
00:30:52,799 --> 00:30:53,360
This won't do.

739
00:30:54,799 --> 00:30:56,079
Go buy some fruits.

740
00:30:56,079 --> 00:30:57,050
The most expensive ones.

741
00:30:57,160 --> 00:30:58,600
It's really fine. You don't have to.

742
00:30:58,840 --> 00:30:59,559
Mingzhu,

743
00:30:59,920 --> 00:31:00,920
just leave them be.

744
00:31:01,079 --> 00:31:01,880
See? I told you.

745
00:31:01,960 --> 00:31:03,004
You're the miracle cure.

746
00:31:03,048 --> 00:31:04,120
You fixed them right up.

747
00:31:04,239 --> 00:31:05,559
You instantly turned two old folks

748
00:31:06,279 --> 00:31:08,120
ready to tear each other's hair out

749
00:31:08,840 --> 00:31:10,559
into a picture of marital bliss.

750
00:31:11,360 --> 00:31:12,559
Xu Zhidong and I

751
00:31:12,559 --> 00:31:13,719
are no match for you.

752
00:31:16,039 --> 00:31:17,239
Let's open this up.

753
00:31:17,239 --> 00:31:17,640
Okay.

754
00:31:17,640 --> 00:31:18,880
Here, try it.

755
00:31:18,880 --> 00:31:20,239
Yes, this one.

756
00:31:20,640 --> 00:31:21,680
She must be hungry.

757
00:31:21,960 --> 00:31:23,920
Let her try it one by one.

758
00:31:23,920 --> 00:31:24,400
Look at you.

759
00:31:24,400 --> 00:31:25,799
Here, open up.

760
00:31:27,871 --> 00:31:28,880
You don't like sweet food?

761
00:31:28,880 --> 00:31:29,440
Mom,

762
00:31:30,319 --> 00:31:31,120
I'm hungry too.

763
00:31:31,479 --> 00:31:32,960
There are steamed buns in the fridge.

764
00:31:32,960 --> 00:31:33,880
Go get them yourself.

765
00:31:34,048 --> 00:31:35,840
You want to drink this?
I'll open it for you.

766
00:31:35,840 --> 00:31:36,719
But is cold drink okay?

767
00:31:36,719 --> 00:31:38,200
It's okay. I got this.

768
00:31:38,279 --> 00:31:39,039
It's cold.

769
00:31:43,079 --> 00:31:44,120
Honestly,

770
00:31:44,160 --> 00:31:45,239
our banquet hall

771
00:31:45,239 --> 00:31:46,519
is indeed a bit dated.

772
00:31:47,079 --> 00:31:48,719
I've asked management before

773
00:31:48,719 --> 00:31:49,840
about renovating it,

774
00:31:50,440 --> 00:31:51,799
but they didn't agree.

775
00:31:52,319 --> 00:31:53,519
Why didn't they agree?

776
00:31:54,759 --> 00:31:55,440
No budget.

777
00:31:56,039 --> 00:31:57,319
Just like us.

778
00:31:58,640 --> 00:32:00,920
I have a good friend
who works in wedding planning.

779
00:32:00,920 --> 00:32:01,880
She's amazing.

780
00:32:01,960 --> 00:32:04,826
She can turn old into vintage,
designing all kinds of retro themes.

781
00:32:05,440 --> 00:32:06,960
Here, take a look at these mock-ups.

782
00:32:09,448 --> 00:32:10,550
This one's Hong Kong–style,

783
00:32:11,920 --> 00:32:12,920
this one's Republic-era,

784
00:32:13,920 --> 00:32:15,600
and this one's 1980s retro.

785
00:32:16,239 --> 00:32:17,479
See which one you like.

786
00:32:18,600 --> 00:32:19,719
They're all pretty cool.

787
00:32:19,719 --> 00:32:20,319
Yes.

788
00:32:20,560 --> 00:32:21,710
Which one do you like best?

789
00:32:22,440 --> 00:32:23,799
I think

790
00:32:24,319 --> 00:32:25,759
I like the Republic-era theme.

791
00:32:26,120 --> 00:32:27,279
It feels so elegant.

792
00:32:27,560 --> 00:32:29,310
Lijun Hotel doesn't have
this kind of vibe.

793
00:32:29,759 --> 00:32:31,160
You checked out Lijun?

794
00:32:31,440 --> 00:32:31,960
Yes.

795
00:32:32,440 --> 00:32:34,360
It was 8,888 yuan per table.

796
00:32:34,440 --> 00:32:35,693
That's just the starting price.

797
00:32:36,400 --> 00:32:37,079
Honestly,

798
00:32:37,400 --> 00:32:39,440
Lijun is fancier than our place.

799
00:32:39,782 --> 00:32:41,840
River view, grand dome ceiling,
really impressive.

800
00:32:42,360 --> 00:32:44,079
My sister-in-law actually works there.

801
00:32:44,093 --> 00:32:45,640
What's your sister-in-law's name?

802
00:32:45,880 --> 00:32:46,640
Feng Meiqi.

803
00:32:47,479 --> 00:32:48,319
Really?

804
00:32:48,920 --> 00:32:50,440
What a small world!

805
00:32:51,079 --> 00:32:52,559
She's my closest high school friend.

806
00:32:52,559 --> 00:32:53,799
I'm going to video call her now.

807
00:32:53,826 --> 00:32:54,510
That's not necessary.

808
00:32:54,519 --> 00:32:55,279
It's fine.

809
00:32:56,400 --> 00:32:57,079
Meiqi,

810
00:32:57,440 --> 00:32:58,479
look who this is.

811
00:32:59,479 --> 00:33:00,239
Hi, Meiqi.

812
00:33:01,600 --> 00:33:02,479
Mingzhu?

813
00:33:02,719 --> 00:33:03,920
What are you doing together?

814
00:33:05,479 --> 00:33:06,920
I'm introducing them

815
00:33:06,920 --> 00:33:08,279
our hotel's wedding hall.

816
00:33:08,719 --> 00:33:10,479
Sorry for snatching your client.

817
00:33:11,239 --> 00:33:11,960
It's fine.

818
00:33:12,920 --> 00:33:14,279
Nanxi Hotel is more economical.

819
00:33:15,479 --> 00:33:18,239
Yes, because we can't afford Lijun.

820
00:33:19,519 --> 00:33:20,200
By the way,

821
00:33:20,200 --> 00:33:21,440
did you know that Mingzhu

822
00:33:21,440 --> 00:33:23,160
is my boyfriend's long-lost sister?

823
00:33:25,440 --> 00:33:25,960
Really?

824
00:33:27,039 --> 00:33:28,920
Mingzhu, you found your birth parents?

825
00:33:31,319 --> 00:33:32,719
It just happened recently.

826
00:33:33,079 --> 00:33:34,640
Why didn't you tell us?

827
00:33:35,880 --> 00:33:36,960
I haven't had the chance.

828
00:33:38,960 --> 00:33:39,640
Meiqi,

829
00:33:39,799 --> 00:33:41,360
let me show you the other venue options.

830
00:33:43,479 --> 00:33:44,960
Did we cause you trouble?

831
00:33:45,640 --> 00:33:46,200
No. It's fine.

832
00:33:46,840 --> 00:33:47,479
Oh, no.

833
00:33:48,479 --> 00:33:49,960
Oh, no, this is bad.

834
00:33:50,920 --> 00:33:52,279
Really bad.

835
00:33:53,239 --> 00:33:55,960
Shen Mingzhu suddenly
has two new parents,

836
00:33:56,279 --> 00:33:58,680
an older sister, and a little brother.

837
00:33:59,160 --> 00:34:00,759
And they are just ordinary folks,

838
00:34:00,759 --> 00:34:02,239
no money, no status, no resources.

839
00:34:02,239 --> 00:34:03,479
They can't help with anything.

840
00:34:07,799 --> 00:34:09,199
What if one day they expect us

841
00:34:09,199 --> 00:34:11,240
to use our connections for them?

842
00:34:11,960 --> 00:34:13,280
Come on, it's not that serious.

843
00:34:14,320 --> 00:34:14,920
Don't

844
00:34:14,999 --> 00:34:17,079
work yourself up over things

845
00:34:17,079 --> 00:34:18,119
that haven't even happened.

846
00:34:18,159 --> 00:34:20,159
Dad's right.

847
00:34:21,119 --> 00:34:22,840
I simply shared that to you as a gossip.

848
00:34:22,840 --> 00:34:24,079
And you're overreacting.

849
00:34:24,240 --> 00:34:25,679
I won't tell you anything next time.

850
00:34:25,720 --> 00:34:26,479
Feng Meiqi,

851
00:34:27,079 --> 00:34:28,800
you're too young and naive.

852
00:34:28,800 --> 00:34:29,760
You don't understand.

853
00:34:29,871 --> 00:34:31,150
And you, why are you laughing?

854
00:34:31,159 --> 00:34:31,880
You're no better,

855
00:34:31,880 --> 00:34:33,159
never care about anything!

856
00:34:33,479 --> 00:34:34,479
I'm telling you both,

857
00:34:35,240 --> 00:34:36,760
this is serious.

858
00:34:38,360 --> 00:34:40,639
Shen Mingzhu didn't
even tell us about this.

859
00:34:41,400 --> 00:34:43,559
Do you know what that means?

860
00:34:43,559 --> 00:34:44,760
What does it mean?

861
00:34:46,400 --> 00:34:48,240
It means Shen Mingzhu's loyalty

862
00:34:48,920 --> 00:34:50,240
is wavering.

863
00:34:50,960 --> 00:34:51,960
It means

864
00:34:51,960 --> 00:34:54,960
she doesn't see us as her own family.

865
00:35:00,679 --> 00:35:01,760
I regret it now.

866
00:35:03,400 --> 00:35:04,599
I never should've given her

867
00:35:04,599 --> 00:35:06,639
that heirloom bracelet so early.

868
00:35:07,479 --> 00:35:09,320
Yes, you should've
given it to me instead.

869
00:35:09,320 --> 00:35:09,880
That's enough.

870
00:35:10,720 --> 00:35:11,599
Don't butt in.

871
00:35:14,400 --> 00:35:15,679
What's done is done.

872
00:35:16,599 --> 00:35:17,479
And anyway,

873
00:35:17,479 --> 00:35:19,159
even if Mingzhu's feelings are divided,

874
00:35:19,440 --> 00:35:21,079
she's still carrying

875
00:35:21,280 --> 00:35:23,119
our family's grandchild, isn't she?

876
00:35:23,519 --> 00:35:26,320
Precisely because
she's carrying our grandchild,

877
00:35:26,320 --> 00:35:28,800
she must stay absolutely loyal to us.

878
00:35:29,240 --> 00:35:30,079
Oh my god, Mom,

879
00:35:30,079 --> 00:35:32,800
you can control everything
but not someone's heart.

880
00:35:32,800 --> 00:35:33,360
That's right.

881
00:35:33,440 --> 00:35:34,426
What do you mean by that?

882
00:35:35,293 --> 00:35:36,070
What does that mean?

883
00:35:36,119 --> 00:35:38,020
Does Shen Mingzhu
have something else going on

884
00:35:38,026 --> 00:35:39,471
that you're not telling me? Tell me!

885
00:35:39,479 --> 00:35:40,479
Nothing.

886
00:35:40,960 --> 00:35:42,070
You're being irrational.

887
00:35:42,070 --> 00:35:43,604
I'm not telling you anything anymore.

888
00:35:43,679 --> 00:35:44,639
Oh no, listen now,

889
00:35:44,639 --> 00:35:45,760
you're telling me everything.

890
00:35:46,199 --> 00:35:48,559
From now on, any little sign,

891
00:35:48,559 --> 00:35:50,629
rumor, or whisper,
you report it to me immediately.

892
00:35:50,630 --> 00:35:52,493
That's called prevention
before trouble starts!

893
00:35:53,604 --> 00:35:54,804
I'm going to take a bath.

894
00:35:57,840 --> 00:35:58,440
Feng.

895
00:35:59,159 --> 00:35:59,800
Feng.

896
00:36:00,199 --> 00:36:01,360
I'm coming now.

897
00:36:01,360 --> 00:36:01,960
Right over.

898
00:36:02,360 --> 00:36:03,920
Something has come up at the factory.

899
00:36:03,960 --> 00:36:04,720
I have to be there.

900
00:36:04,720 --> 00:36:05,760
At this hour?

901
00:36:05,760 --> 00:36:06,720
What came up?

902
00:36:06,720 --> 00:36:07,479
Where are you going?

903
00:36:07,479 --> 00:36:08,679
The factory.

904
00:36:22,240 --> 00:36:22,880
Mingzhu.

905
00:36:24,479 --> 00:36:25,119
Mom?

906
00:36:25,800 --> 00:36:26,800
You're still awake?

907
00:36:28,160 --> 00:36:29,110
I was waiting for you.

908
00:36:30,479 --> 00:36:31,320
Me?

909
00:36:32,800 --> 00:36:33,679
I heard

910
00:36:34,880 --> 00:36:36,800
you found your birth parents.

911
00:36:40,559 --> 00:36:41,240
Yes.

912
00:36:42,440 --> 00:36:43,960
Why didn't you tell us?

913
00:36:46,199 --> 00:36:48,079
It happened just a few days ago.

914
00:36:48,360 --> 00:36:49,639
I haven't had the chance.

915
00:36:50,599 --> 00:36:51,720
We see each other everyday,

916
00:36:51,720 --> 00:36:53,240
morning and night.

917
00:36:53,240 --> 00:36:54,604
You haven't had the chance?

918
00:36:55,079 --> 00:36:55,840
I don't think so.

919
00:36:56,960 --> 00:36:58,880
Did you not want to tell me?

920
00:37:00,160 --> 00:37:02,070
Do you really see this place
as your home?

921
00:37:02,840 --> 00:37:04,800
Do you really see us as your family?

922
00:37:07,639 --> 00:37:08,479
Actually,

923
00:37:09,119 --> 00:37:11,119
this relationship is too complicated.

924
00:37:11,604 --> 00:37:13,440
I haven't figured out
how to deal with it.

925
00:37:13,515 --> 00:37:15,293
That's why I didn't say anything.

926
00:37:16,280 --> 00:37:17,360
I'm sorry, Mom.

927
00:37:17,760 --> 00:37:19,079
If it's complicated,

928
00:37:19,960 --> 00:37:21,280
stay away from them then.

929
00:37:22,639 --> 00:37:24,639
Your emotions could affect the baby.

930
00:37:26,079 --> 00:37:26,800
You got it?

931
00:37:28,159 --> 00:37:29,199
Also, Mingzhu,

932
00:37:29,960 --> 00:37:32,079
if you encounter any trouble again,

933
00:37:32,079 --> 00:37:33,479
you have to tell us.

934
00:37:33,920 --> 00:37:35,400
We'll help you.

935
00:37:37,248 --> 00:37:38,840
I've made you some white fungus soup.

936
00:37:38,840 --> 00:37:39,880
It's on the coffee table.

937
00:37:39,960 --> 00:37:41,290
Have some before you go to sleep.

938
00:37:41,293 --> 00:37:42,182
Thanks, Mom.

939
00:37:42,280 --> 00:37:43,280
I'm going back then.

940
00:37:43,280 --> 00:37:44,159
Go on.

941
00:37:44,159 --> 00:37:45,479
Okay, good night.

942
00:38:44,620 --> 00:38:48,220
(Shen's Restaurant)

943
00:38:56,960 --> 00:38:58,639
Hurry up!

944
00:38:59,960 --> 00:39:00,920
I'm coming!

945
00:39:01,360 --> 00:39:01,960
I'm here.

946
00:39:03,960 --> 00:39:04,679
Dacheng.

947
00:39:05,240 --> 00:39:05,880
Dacheng!

948
00:39:06,400 --> 00:39:07,320
Check this out.

949
00:39:08,337 --> 00:39:09,720
Our daughter bought it for me.

950
00:39:09,960 --> 00:39:10,800
Looks nice, right?

951
00:39:13,599 --> 00:39:14,599
This is family heirloom.

952
00:39:14,599 --> 00:39:15,760
It's from my mother-in-law.

953
00:39:16,519 --> 00:39:18,199
You should wear it all the time.

954
00:39:18,199 --> 00:39:19,920
No way. It's a family heirloom.

955
00:39:24,920 --> 00:39:27,280
You know, my husband looks so handsome.

956
00:39:27,840 --> 00:39:28,999
Alright, everything's ready.

957
00:39:28,999 --> 00:39:29,599
Let's go.

958
00:39:29,760 --> 00:39:30,920
Zhidong!

959
00:39:32,479 --> 00:39:33,400
Zhidong!

960
00:39:34,079 --> 00:39:35,720
- Coming!
- It's time to go!

961
00:39:35,960 --> 00:39:37,479
Mom, you forgot the ginseng!

962
00:39:37,720 --> 00:39:39,479
You're the one who should carry it!

963
00:39:39,960 --> 00:39:42,400
We're going to Bichen's house!
Why are you dawdling?

964
00:39:42,400 --> 00:39:42,960
Mom,

965
00:39:43,720 --> 00:39:44,960
is the bride price all ready?

966
00:39:46,720 --> 00:39:47,639
The bride price

967
00:39:48,240 --> 00:39:49,679
is all in the bank.

968
00:39:50,240 --> 00:39:52,004
I thought we were giving it
to them today?

969
00:39:54,320 --> 00:39:55,039
Zhidong,

970
00:39:55,400 --> 00:39:56,240
here's the thing,

971
00:39:58,479 --> 00:40:00,199
I'll explain it clearly

972
00:40:00,199 --> 00:40:01,400
to Bichen's parents.

973
00:40:02,479 --> 00:40:03,920
We'll give the bride price

974
00:40:04,880 --> 00:40:06,800
to the bride

975
00:40:06,800 --> 00:40:08,079
on the wedding eve party.

976
00:40:08,840 --> 00:40:09,920
You just tell them

977
00:40:10,079 --> 00:40:12,360
it's an old tradition from our hometown.

978
00:40:12,360 --> 00:40:13,280
An old custom.

979
00:40:13,840 --> 00:40:14,440
Dad,

980
00:40:15,199 --> 00:40:16,440
what wedding eve party?

981
00:40:16,440 --> 00:40:17,493
Do we have such a custom?

982
00:40:18,159 --> 00:40:18,920
Your mom

983
00:40:18,920 --> 00:40:20,079
is clearly joking.

984
00:40:20,479 --> 00:40:21,240
Fine, fine.

985
00:40:21,639 --> 00:40:22,479
Xu Dacheng,

986
00:40:23,880 --> 00:40:25,880
200,000 is not a small amount.

987
00:40:25,880 --> 00:40:27,119
I know, I know.

988
00:40:27,479 --> 00:40:28,079
Zhidong,

989
00:40:28,479 --> 00:40:30,599
mine and your father's life savings

990
00:40:30,599 --> 00:40:31,669
are in there,

991
00:40:31,670 --> 00:40:33,337
plus your sister's 100,000!

992
00:40:33,360 --> 00:40:34,440
And I'm eternally grateful.

993
00:40:34,440 --> 00:40:35,537
Besides, just in case...

994
00:40:35,760 --> 00:40:36,720
I'm just saying in case,

995
00:40:37,360 --> 00:40:39,400
things don't work out
with you and Bichen...

996
00:40:39,400 --> 00:40:40,280
That's impossible.

997
00:40:40,280 --> 00:40:41,720
I know it's impossible!

998
00:40:41,720 --> 00:40:43,240
I'm just talking about a "what if",

999
00:40:43,679 --> 00:40:44,320
right?

1000
00:40:45,915 --> 00:40:48,550
It's much harder to get money
back than it is to give it away.

1001
00:40:49,079 --> 00:40:50,159
Alright, don't worry.

1002
00:40:50,479 --> 00:40:51,840
Your mother knows what she's doing.

1003
00:40:51,960 --> 00:40:52,599
Okay.

1004
00:40:52,648 --> 00:40:53,630
Just wish me the best.

1005
00:40:53,880 --> 00:40:54,629
Alright!

1006
00:40:54,630 --> 00:40:55,537
Off to buy groceries?

1007
00:40:56,720 --> 00:40:58,240
You're all dressed so formally.

1008
00:40:58,240 --> 00:40:59,440
Where are you going?

1009
00:41:00,599 --> 00:41:01,920
Paying a visit to the in-laws!

1010
00:41:02,599 --> 00:41:03,320
Zhidong,

1011
00:41:03,760 --> 00:41:05,320
when's the wedding banquet?

1012
00:41:05,337 --> 00:41:07,440
Soon, Madam Zheng. I'll send you
an invitation when it's time.

1013
00:41:07,440 --> 00:41:08,639
Alright, I'll be waiting!

1014
00:41:08,639 --> 00:41:11,199
A son's wedding will
be the death of his father!

1015
00:41:11,840 --> 00:41:12,960
But it's a happy occasion!

1016
00:41:12,960 --> 00:41:14,320
The exhaustion is worth it!

1017
00:41:14,960 --> 00:41:15,920
That's right.

1018
00:41:15,960 --> 00:41:16,639
Easy there.

1019
00:41:16,639 --> 00:41:17,479
Careful.

1020
00:41:18,240 --> 00:41:19,119
I got in.

1021
00:41:21,720 --> 00:41:22,240
Alright!

1022
00:41:25,060 --> 00:41:29,300
(Nanzhou First People's Hospital)

1023
00:41:29,760 --> 00:41:30,960
The test results are good.

1024
00:41:30,960 --> 00:41:31,937
Nothing to worry about.

1025
00:41:32,004 --> 00:41:34,004
I've been busy planning
a wedding banquet lately.

1026
00:41:34,004 --> 00:41:34,960
Strangely, keeping busy

1027
00:41:34,960 --> 00:41:36,559
has helped me eat and sleep better.

1028
00:41:36,560 --> 00:41:38,226
Because you're
keeping yourself occupied.

1029
00:41:38,248 --> 00:41:39,620
But still, don't overwork yourself.

1030
00:41:40,671 --> 00:41:42,440
By the way, I wanted
to ask you something.

1031
00:41:42,440 --> 00:41:44,280
My uncle is turning 70 next month.

1032
00:41:44,280 --> 00:41:46,115
Does Nanxi Hotel
handle birthday banquets?

1033
00:41:46,137 --> 00:41:47,093
Of course we do!

1034
00:41:47,226 --> 00:41:49,320
If you book with us,
I'll get a discount for you.

1035
00:41:49,320 --> 00:41:50,693
Great, I'll let the family know.

1036
00:41:50,700 --> 00:41:52,880
I'll visit your hotel this weekend
to take a look first.

1037
00:41:52,880 --> 00:41:53,960
Sure, no problem.

1038
00:41:53,960 --> 00:41:55,400
Just call me before you come.

1039
00:41:55,400 --> 00:41:56,199
Sure.

1040
00:41:56,400 --> 00:41:56,920
I'm done.

1041
00:41:56,920 --> 00:41:57,720
Take care.

1042
00:41:57,840 --> 00:41:58,400
Bye.

1043
00:41:58,679 --> 00:41:59,199
Come in.

1044
00:42:01,440 --> 00:42:02,519
Look at their building.

1045
00:42:02,679 --> 00:42:03,240
Come.

1046
00:42:03,582 --> 00:42:04,280
Give it to me.

1047
00:42:04,280 --> 00:42:05,119
Here.

1048
00:42:05,320 --> 00:42:06,039
Hold it.

1049
00:42:08,240 --> 00:42:09,720
There's another one here.

1050
00:42:09,720 --> 00:42:10,280
Come.

1051
00:42:10,537 --> 00:42:11,320
Let me get off this.

1052
00:42:11,320 --> 00:42:11,920
Easy there.

1053
00:42:11,920 --> 00:42:12,720
Give your mom a hand.

1054
00:42:12,720 --> 00:42:13,559
I got this.

1055
00:42:14,880 --> 00:42:15,679
I got this.

1056
00:42:16,599 --> 00:42:17,760
I'll carry some.

1057
00:42:18,840 --> 00:42:19,840
This neighborhood...

1058
00:42:20,360 --> 00:42:21,920
Bichen's neighborhood is also

1059
00:42:22,199 --> 00:42:23,840
such a mess.

1060
00:42:24,840 --> 00:42:26,360
It's not like you live in a mansion.

1061
00:42:26,360 --> 00:42:27,720
Why are you picking on them?

1062
00:42:27,720 --> 00:42:28,280
Hear that?

1063
00:42:28,519 --> 00:42:29,880
Dad has got a point.

1064
00:42:31,760 --> 00:42:33,280
You're always

1065
00:42:33,519 --> 00:42:34,599
sticking together.

1066
00:42:34,715 --> 00:42:36,110
- Mr and Mrs. Xu!
- Hi, Bichen!

1067
00:42:36,280 --> 00:42:36,880
Chen.

1068
00:42:36,880 --> 00:42:37,804
- Bichen!
- Mrs. Xu.

1069
00:42:37,999 --> 00:42:38,720
Bichen.

1070
00:42:38,720 --> 00:42:39,871
Let me carry that for you.

1071
00:42:39,915 --> 00:42:41,360
- I got this.
- It's okay.
