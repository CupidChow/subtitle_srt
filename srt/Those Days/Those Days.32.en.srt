00:01:12,431 --> 00:01:14,800
(Adapted from iceread.com novel
"You Xi" by Qingyang Wanxi)

00:01:14,980 --> 00:01:17,980
=Episode 32=

4
00:01:25,820 --> 00:01:27,640
(Nanzhou Station)

5
00:01:27,640 --> 00:01:28,319
Alright.

6
00:01:28,880 --> 00:01:29,960
Let's stop here.

7
00:01:30,679 --> 00:01:33,080
I won't text my arrival when I get home.

8
00:01:33,759 --> 00:01:35,240
No news means I'm fine.

9
00:01:37,039 --> 00:01:38,440
When the insurance pays out,

10
00:01:38,440 --> 00:01:40,000
I'll wire it to you right away.

11
00:01:41,520 --> 00:01:43,319
Text us once you're home.

12
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:45,559
We'll miss Xiaoqi.

13
00:01:48,640 --> 00:01:49,399
Mingzhu.

14
00:01:49,720 --> 00:01:52,479
I'll miss you all very much.

15
00:01:55,479 --> 00:01:56,080
Go on.

16
00:01:56,399 --> 00:01:57,679
Go back with your mom.

17
00:02:04,399 --> 00:02:05,399
Add me on WeChat.

18
00:02:09,360 --> 00:02:11,119
(Blood is strange like that.)

19
00:02:11,439 --> 00:02:12,679
(It magnifies love and hate.)

20
00:02:12,960 --> 00:02:14,480
(It softens grudges too.)

21
00:02:14,839 --> 00:02:15,879
(For my father-in-law,)

22
00:02:16,200 --> 00:02:18,240
(Ding Hong)
(they nearly fought.)

23
00:02:18,520 --> 00:02:19,679
(For the child,)

24
00:02:19,720 --> 00:02:21,119
(they stiffened their expressions)

25
00:02:21,279 --> 00:02:23,159
(and awkwardly exchanged WeChat.)

26
00:02:25,599 --> 00:02:26,399
Be good.

27
00:02:28,119 --> 00:02:29,800
Alright, we'll get going.

28
00:02:30,320 --> 00:02:31,119
Take care.

29
00:02:49,719 --> 00:02:50,960
Goodbye.

30
00:02:50,999 --> 00:02:52,480
Text us on WeChat.

31
00:02:58,200 --> 00:02:59,040
(I know)

32
00:02:59,240 --> 00:03:01,559
(going our separate ways)

33
00:03:01,879 --> 00:03:03,399
(is inevitable now.)

34
00:03:11,679 --> 00:03:12,439
Shen Minghui.

35
00:03:13,719 --> 00:03:16,159
I know you've been streaming lately

36
00:03:17,320 --> 00:03:18,999
and doing pretty well.

37
00:03:20,439 --> 00:03:21,679
But do you realize

38
00:03:22,559 --> 00:03:24,879
your grades and your revenue

39
00:03:24,879 --> 00:03:26,320
are moving opposite ways?

40
00:03:27,800 --> 00:03:29,279
Can't you wait a bit?

41
00:03:29,760 --> 00:03:30,999
Wait till gaokao ends.

42
00:03:30,999 --> 00:03:32,360
Have no burden and go all in.

43
00:03:32,360 --> 00:03:33,439
Wouldn't that be better?

44
00:03:34,439 --> 00:03:35,159
Mr. Hu.

45
00:03:36,520 --> 00:03:37,640
My family needs money.

46
00:03:38,920 --> 00:03:41,200
Push through it then.

47
00:03:41,520 --> 00:03:43,040
How do I push through no money?

48
00:03:43,360 --> 00:03:44,080
Mr. Hu.

49
00:03:44,360 --> 00:03:46,080
I'll tutor Minghui.

50
00:03:50,080 --> 00:03:50,800
Lu Bing.

51
00:03:51,719 --> 00:03:53,439
That's also why I called you here.

52
00:03:55,200 --> 00:03:56,240
Here, look.

53
00:03:58,480 --> 00:04:01,480
Your grade
has fallen out of the top five.

54
00:04:02,640 --> 00:04:03,520
If you keep this up...

55
00:04:03,520 --> 00:04:05,599
Mr. Hu, I know.

56
00:04:05,960 --> 00:04:07,279
I'll study harder.

57
00:04:07,520 --> 00:04:08,760
I'll help Minghui too.

58
00:04:09,960 --> 00:04:11,439
That's not my point.

59
00:04:11,719 --> 00:04:13,800
Gaokao is right around the corner.

60
00:04:13,800 --> 00:04:15,679
Could you manage yourself first?

61
00:04:16,440 --> 00:04:17,640
You know our school only sends

62
00:04:17,640 --> 00:04:20,440
five or six kids to Tsinghua University
and Peking University.

63
00:04:21,080 --> 00:04:23,000
One slip and it's over.

64
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:23,640
Lu Bing.

65
00:04:23,640 --> 00:04:24,320
Mr. Hu.

66
00:04:25,120 --> 00:04:26,200
The way you say it

67
00:04:26,540 --> 00:04:28,839
make it sounds like Lu Bing
is about to become a criminal.

68
00:04:28,839 --> 00:04:29,760
Shut up.

69
00:04:30,839 --> 00:04:31,560
Mr. Hu.

70
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:34,200
You're a good teacher.

71
00:04:35,080 --> 00:04:36,120
I get everything you said,

72
00:04:37,279 --> 00:04:38,320
but I'm not listening.

73
00:04:40,560 --> 00:04:41,760
I'm a repeat student.

74
00:04:42,680 --> 00:04:45,599
But I'll stick with Shen Minghui

75
00:04:45,960 --> 00:04:48,000
even if we can't get into college.

76
00:04:48,159 --> 00:04:48,719
No, you...

77
00:04:49,239 --> 00:04:49,960
No, you...

78
00:04:51,919 --> 00:04:52,680
Shen Minghui.

79
00:04:52,960 --> 00:04:53,960
Did you hear that?

80
00:04:53,960 --> 00:04:55,320
Did you hear her?

81
00:04:55,399 --> 00:04:57,120
Aren't you moved?

82
00:04:57,120 --> 00:04:58,919
Don't you want to catch up?

83
00:04:59,440 --> 00:05:00,839
To meet a girl like her...

84
00:05:12,039 --> 00:05:13,120
Well... Lu Bing.

85
00:05:13,120 --> 00:05:14,039
Go back to class.

86
00:05:17,039 --> 00:05:18,239
Shen Minghui, stay.

87
00:05:19,120 --> 00:05:20,080
Sit there.

88
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:22,080
Correct your test answers.

89
00:05:35,279 --> 00:05:38,080
(Maybe it's time to be a man)

90
00:05:38,680 --> 00:05:40,279
(and say goodbye with dignity.)

91
00:05:55,420 --> 00:05:57,300
(Nanzhou New District People's Court,
Sealed)

92
00:05:59,159 --> 00:05:59,719
Mom.

93
00:06:00,120 --> 00:06:01,239
Let's go home.

94
00:06:01,680 --> 00:06:02,839
Home is always best.

95
00:06:03,960 --> 00:06:04,599
Yeah.

96
00:06:05,520 --> 00:06:06,159
Go home.

97
00:06:10,120 --> 00:06:10,960
Careful, Mom.

98
00:06:24,640 --> 00:06:25,239
Here.

99
00:06:30,159 --> 00:06:31,359
Rest a bit first.

100
00:06:31,599 --> 00:06:32,399
I'll cook.

101
00:06:35,520 --> 00:06:36,200
Mingzhu.

102
00:06:37,399 --> 00:06:39,120
Our family wronged you.

103
00:06:40,279 --> 00:06:42,000
Mom, why bring this up again?

104
00:06:42,919 --> 00:06:44,719
You need to help her with her baby.

105
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:46,599
It's an honorable job.

106
00:06:47,239 --> 00:06:48,279
Yes.

107
00:06:50,399 --> 00:06:52,680
The three of us
will live well from now on.

108
00:06:53,279 --> 00:06:53,880
Okay.

109
00:06:54,039 --> 00:06:55,120
And the little one too.

110
00:06:59,520 --> 00:07:01,839
Mom. You have to follow
the chart the doctor gave you

111
00:07:01,839 --> 00:07:03,239
and do your physiotherapy properly.

112
00:07:03,239 --> 00:07:03,839
Okay.

113
00:07:03,960 --> 00:07:05,359
No slacking.

114
00:07:05,359 --> 00:07:05,919
Okay.

115
00:07:06,039 --> 00:07:07,039
If you recover earlier,

116
00:07:07,039 --> 00:07:08,839
Meiqi and I can be relieved earlier.

117
00:07:08,839 --> 00:07:09,520
Okay.

118
00:07:10,080 --> 00:07:10,760
Meiqi.

119
00:07:10,760 --> 00:07:13,080
Stay home and take care of Mom for now.

120
00:07:13,080 --> 00:07:14,900
I'm going back to work
at the hotel tomorrow.

121
00:07:14,919 --> 00:07:16,799
We'll each do our part.

122
00:07:17,239 --> 00:07:17,839
Okay.

123
00:07:18,159 --> 00:07:18,760
Okay.

124
00:07:25,900 --> 00:07:28,580
(Nanxi Hotel's F&B Department
is closed for renovation.)

125
00:07:37,359 --> 00:07:37,919
Mr. Zhao.

126
00:07:38,880 --> 00:07:39,760
You scared me.

127
00:07:40,320 --> 00:07:41,760
I saw the sign outside saying

128
00:07:41,760 --> 00:07:43,640
the restaurant is closed for renovation.

129
00:07:45,200 --> 00:07:45,760
Yes.

130
00:07:46,560 --> 00:07:47,560
What's going on?

131
00:07:49,839 --> 00:07:50,479
Mingzhu.

132
00:07:51,080 --> 00:07:52,120
I'll be honest with you.

133
00:07:52,860 --> 00:07:53,799
The renovation is fake.

134
00:07:54,479 --> 00:07:55,359
The closure is real.

135
00:07:56,560 --> 00:07:58,399
They're cutting
the whole F&B department.

136
00:07:58,640 --> 00:07:59,520
Everyone's laid off.

137
00:07:59,719 --> 00:08:00,599
Housekeeping

138
00:08:01,320 --> 00:08:02,520
probably won't survive either.

139
00:08:03,039 --> 00:08:05,279
You're pregnant, so you escaped.

140
00:08:05,279 --> 00:08:07,719
At least you still get a minimum wage.

141
00:08:09,760 --> 00:08:10,520
Be grateful.

142
00:08:11,039 --> 00:08:14,159
Go home and take care of the baby.

143
00:08:14,159 --> 00:08:14,799
No.

144
00:08:14,799 --> 00:08:17,159
What about after I give birth?

145
00:08:17,640 --> 00:08:18,520
After?

146
00:08:18,880 --> 00:08:20,159
We'll see then.

147
00:08:20,159 --> 00:08:21,279
Tell me now.

148
00:08:22,960 --> 00:08:24,120
When my maternity leave ends,

149
00:08:24,460 --> 00:08:25,719
it'll be my turn to be laid off?

150
00:08:28,080 --> 00:08:28,719
Mingzhu.

151
00:08:30,159 --> 00:08:31,599
I really have no choice.

152
00:08:48,879 --> 00:08:50,440
Was this place sold?

153
00:08:50,879 --> 00:08:51,680
It didn't sell.

154
00:08:51,680 --> 00:08:53,320
We're here to stick the seals again.

155
00:09:07,160 --> 00:09:07,759
Look.

156
00:09:08,040 --> 00:09:09,119
Isn't it a river-view unit?

157
00:09:09,960 --> 00:09:11,960
I'm telling you, it's quiet at night.

158
00:09:11,960 --> 00:09:13,280
You only hear the water.

159
00:09:19,210 --> 00:09:21,160
You came here
because you need something, right?

160
00:09:23,920 --> 00:09:26,400
My workplace is doing mass layoffs.

161
00:09:27,119 --> 00:09:28,759
With our situation at home,

162
00:09:29,320 --> 00:09:30,400
someone has to make money.

163
00:09:31,479 --> 00:09:32,719
So I wanted to ask you

164
00:09:33,359 --> 00:09:35,160
if you could recommend a job for me?

165
00:09:42,960 --> 00:09:45,479
One pregnant woman
helping another get a job?

166
00:09:46,719 --> 00:09:49,519
Both of us
taking maternity leave together?

167
00:09:49,879 --> 00:09:51,599
Unless the company is run by Buddha,

168
00:09:51,599 --> 00:09:53,519
no one is that generous.

169
00:09:55,280 --> 00:09:57,839
Yeah, I just wanted to ask.

170
00:09:57,839 --> 00:09:58,639
Just in case.

171
00:10:00,920 --> 00:10:01,479
Fine.

172
00:10:01,920 --> 00:10:03,759
I'll keep an eye out for you.

173
00:10:03,879 --> 00:10:06,519
See if there's work
without office hours.

174
00:10:08,200 --> 00:10:09,759
Maybe work part-time making slides.

175
00:10:09,760 --> 00:10:10,800
You can make slides, right?

176
00:10:10,800 --> 00:10:11,639
I can.

177
00:10:16,920 --> 00:10:17,560
Zhixia.

178
00:10:18,400 --> 00:10:19,999
What happened between you and Hao?

179
00:10:20,320 --> 00:10:21,440
What did you fight about?

180
00:10:21,440 --> 00:10:22,639
You even moved out.

181
00:10:27,879 --> 00:10:28,999
My mother-in-law

182
00:10:29,320 --> 00:10:32,050
insisted I do an ultrasound
to check if it's a boy or a girl.

183
00:10:32,060 --> 00:10:33,879
If it's a boy,
she'll buy a school-zone home.

184
00:10:33,879 --> 00:10:35,160
If it's a girl, she won't.

185
00:10:37,920 --> 00:10:38,359
Well...

186
00:10:38,359 --> 00:10:41,359
I'm telling you, Mingzhu,
this is a thorn in my side.

187
00:10:41,920 --> 00:10:43,639
Because my mom favors boys,

188
00:10:43,639 --> 00:10:45,479
Xu Zhidong comes to me
for every little thing.

189
00:10:46,040 --> 00:10:47,519
Because my grandma favored boys,

190
00:10:47,519 --> 00:10:49,599
they gave you away.

191
00:10:52,920 --> 00:10:53,719
I'm sorry.

192
00:10:55,599 --> 00:10:57,639
It's fine. It's all in the past.

193
00:10:59,170 --> 00:11:00,759
I don't know if you really moved past it

194
00:11:00,759 --> 00:11:01,639
or if you're just saying it.

195
00:11:01,639 --> 00:11:03,519
But I haven't gotten over it.

196
00:11:03,879 --> 00:11:05,519
Are my mom and grandma bad people?

197
00:11:05,519 --> 00:11:06,200
No.

198
00:11:06,999 --> 00:11:08,280
Did they treat us badly?

199
00:11:08,519 --> 00:11:09,119
No.

200
00:11:09,400 --> 00:11:10,920
My mom thinks about me and you

201
00:11:10,920 --> 00:11:11,639
every day.

202
00:11:11,960 --> 00:11:13,040
My grandma really

203
00:11:13,519 --> 00:11:14,920
held on to dear life,

204
00:11:14,920 --> 00:11:16,320
waiting for you to come back.

205
00:11:16,599 --> 00:11:17,960
But when it mattered most,

206
00:11:17,970 --> 00:11:20,280
I'm the one who suffered,
and you're the one who was abandoned.

207
00:11:20,280 --> 00:11:21,479
All because we were girls.

208
00:11:22,400 --> 00:11:23,359
I don't get it.

209
00:11:23,359 --> 00:11:25,040
I really don't get it.

210
00:11:25,160 --> 00:11:26,999
So no matter the baby I'm carrying

211
00:11:26,999 --> 00:11:28,400
is a boy or girl,

212
00:11:28,719 --> 00:11:30,359
I will never let Jiaojiao

213
00:11:30,359 --> 00:11:32,239
feel confused the way I did.

214
00:11:38,280 --> 00:11:39,719
Pregnant women can't get mad.

215
00:11:39,879 --> 00:11:41,400
Here, have a candy.

216
00:11:42,119 --> 00:11:43,359
Add some sweetness to life.

217
00:11:47,479 --> 00:11:48,879
Just skip the chili.

218
00:11:48,999 --> 00:11:49,560
Okay.

219
00:11:49,680 --> 00:11:51,280
I know you love spicy food.

220
00:11:55,999 --> 00:11:56,519
Hao, you...

221
00:11:56,839 --> 00:11:57,839
She's pregnant.

222
00:11:58,960 --> 00:12:00,639
Why did you take so long?

223
00:12:00,639 --> 00:12:03,200
My old scooter went around half the city
to pick up Chen.

224
00:12:03,200 --> 00:12:04,400
You were rushing me,

225
00:12:04,519 --> 00:12:05,879
so I switched to a fast ride.

226
00:12:05,879 --> 00:12:06,650
It was fast enough.

227
00:12:06,920 --> 00:12:07,719
What's going on?

228
00:12:08,280 --> 00:12:09,920
Things are extremely bad.

229
00:12:10,060 --> 00:12:11,119
I've been here many times.

230
00:12:11,119 --> 00:12:12,119
She won't leave with me.

231
00:12:12,400 --> 00:12:14,320
So I figured you two could help talk to her.

232
00:12:16,040 --> 00:12:17,040
Why us?

233
00:12:17,040 --> 00:12:18,060
My sister listens to me?

234
00:12:18,119 --> 00:12:19,200
She won't listen to you.

235
00:12:20,160 --> 00:12:21,639
But we can each grab a side

236
00:12:21,719 --> 00:12:23,080
and carry her out.

237
00:12:23,400 --> 00:12:24,280
Bichen's here too.

238
00:12:25,800 --> 00:12:26,519
Use tactics?

239
00:12:26,680 --> 00:12:27,400
Use tactics.

240
00:12:29,040 --> 00:12:31,440
My workplace pays me the minimum now.

241
00:12:32,040 --> 00:12:34,080
I don't even know
if they're paying insurance.

242
00:12:34,800 --> 00:12:36,200
They are for sure.

243
00:12:36,719 --> 00:12:38,440
You're pregnant. You're the priority.

244
00:12:39,440 --> 00:12:41,839
Feels like a special privilege.

245
00:12:44,479 --> 00:12:45,280
- Zhixia.
- Hao.

246
00:12:45,400 --> 00:12:46,280
Zhixia.

247
00:12:46,500 --> 00:12:47,160
Zhixia.

248
00:12:47,999 --> 00:12:48,639
Hao.

249
00:12:49,160 --> 00:12:49,999
Mingzhu is here too.

250
00:12:50,560 --> 00:12:51,200
Zhixia.

251
00:12:51,680 --> 00:12:52,800
Come home with me.

252
00:12:54,359 --> 00:12:56,400
Why are you all here together?

253
00:12:56,479 --> 00:12:57,999
I don't have discounted eggs.

254
00:12:58,440 --> 00:12:59,040
Zhixia.

255
00:12:59,479 --> 00:13:01,239
We're here to take you home.

256
00:13:01,599 --> 00:13:02,680
You're pregnant.

257
00:13:02,680 --> 00:13:03,680
Stop making a fuss.

258
00:13:04,239 --> 00:13:05,680
Xu Zhidong, whose side are you on?

259
00:13:05,960 --> 00:13:07,239
Do you even know what's going on?

260
00:13:07,239 --> 00:13:10,180
I'm making a fuss? What did I do?
Who did I bother? Did I invite you here?

261
00:13:10,639 --> 00:13:13,599
See? Why talk to her like that?
Who did she bother? What did she do?

262
00:13:13,599 --> 00:13:14,639
Did she invite you here?

263
00:13:15,999 --> 00:13:16,599
Zhixia.

264
00:13:16,879 --> 00:13:18,479
Give Hao a chance

265
00:13:18,639 --> 00:13:19,800
for Jiaojiao's sake.

266
00:13:19,800 --> 00:13:20,479
Zhixia.

267
00:13:20,560 --> 00:13:21,839
Go home with Hao.

268
00:13:22,519 --> 00:13:23,719
If someone came to pick me up,

269
00:13:23,719 --> 00:13:25,320
I'd run faster than a rabbit.

270
00:13:33,160 --> 00:13:33,879
Come home.

271
00:13:34,280 --> 00:13:35,479
Jiaojiao misses you.

272
00:13:35,800 --> 00:13:37,200
She's losing weight missing you.

273
00:13:37,200 --> 00:13:38,879
I'm not using our kid as leverage.

274
00:13:39,040 --> 00:13:39,839
This home

275
00:13:40,639 --> 00:13:41,759
can't work without you.

276
00:13:45,150 --> 00:13:46,239
It can't work without you.

277
00:13:46,479 --> 00:13:46,960
Yes.

278
00:13:47,920 --> 00:13:48,800
Trying to abduct me?

279
00:13:52,999 --> 00:13:53,800
Depart.

280
00:13:53,879 --> 00:13:55,719
I'm not carrying the crown prince.

281
00:13:57,839 --> 00:13:59,320
Mingzhu. Let's have a meal together.

282
00:13:59,400 --> 00:14:00,359
Hao will pay for it.

283
00:14:00,359 --> 00:14:01,000
- No.
- Yes.

284
00:14:01,010 --> 00:14:02,359
My mother-in-law is still at home.

285
00:14:02,359 --> 00:14:03,440
I need to take care of her.

286
00:14:03,440 --> 00:14:04,280
You all eat.

287
00:14:04,839 --> 00:14:06,759
If you're not going,
there's no point eating.

288
00:14:06,759 --> 00:14:07,999
I'm really not going.

289
00:14:09,040 --> 00:14:10,239
Alright. Well...

290
00:14:10,680 --> 00:14:11,280
Zhidong.

291
00:14:11,400 --> 00:14:12,839
Take Mingzhu home with my car.

292
00:14:12,839 --> 00:14:13,280
Sure.

293
00:14:13,519 --> 00:14:14,119
No need.

294
00:14:14,400 --> 00:14:15,960
Public transport is convenient for me.

295
00:14:15,960 --> 00:14:17,320
It's fine. Let him drive you.

296
00:14:17,440 --> 00:14:18,639
We can walk back.

297
00:14:18,639 --> 00:14:19,910
Save energy and reduce emissions.

298
00:14:20,239 --> 00:14:22,359
You not being director
will do that the most.

299
00:14:22,719 --> 00:14:24,280
Let Xu Zhidong drive you.

300
00:14:24,280 --> 00:14:25,719
He's moving to Qianhu soon.

301
00:14:25,719 --> 00:14:27,200
Might as well use him now.

302
00:14:28,960 --> 00:14:29,519
Zhixia.

303
00:14:29,960 --> 00:14:31,599
You knew about this?

304
00:14:32,400 --> 00:14:33,960
Mom called to complain.

305
00:14:33,999 --> 00:14:35,080
What did you tell her?

306
00:14:35,920 --> 00:14:37,519
I said I was divorcing Zhang Hao.

307
00:14:37,519 --> 00:14:38,960
She hung up right away.

308
00:14:40,280 --> 00:14:40,879
You...

309
00:14:43,960 --> 00:14:44,680
Bye, Mingzhu.

310
00:14:44,680 --> 00:14:45,280
Bye.

311
00:14:46,200 --> 00:14:47,160
Let's go, Mingzhu.

312
00:14:48,719 --> 00:14:50,320
Bichen, you're showing a bit too.

313
00:14:50,320 --> 00:14:51,560
Appetite's been great lately.

314
00:14:51,560 --> 00:14:52,200
Right?

315
00:14:57,639 --> 00:14:59,440
Mom, look. The doctor said to do this.

316
00:14:59,440 --> 00:15:00,519
One hand outward.

317
00:15:00,839 --> 00:15:01,960
One hand inward.

318
00:15:03,320 --> 00:15:03,920
Like this.

319
00:15:04,999 --> 00:15:06,320
Yes. One hand outward.

320
00:15:06,599 --> 00:15:07,719
The other hand inward.

321
00:15:10,400 --> 00:15:11,960
Good. Both hands together.

322
00:15:13,999 --> 00:15:15,200
Yes, just like that, Mom.

323
00:15:17,359 --> 00:15:17,920
Yes.

324
00:15:21,560 --> 00:15:22,440
It's okay, Mom.

325
00:15:22,759 --> 00:15:23,519
Take it slow.

00:16:11,320 --> 00:16:12,040
Shoot four.

338
00:16:13,359 --> 00:16:14,119
Shoot four.

339
00:16:16,280 --> 00:16:17,800
Yes, no rush.

340
00:16:17,800 --> 00:16:19,200
Grab one gun first.

341
00:16:19,879 --> 00:16:20,560
Yes.

342
00:16:20,560 --> 00:16:22,119
Shoot four.

343
00:16:22,400 --> 00:16:23,400
Yes, switch.

344
00:16:24,440 --> 00:16:25,040
Mom.

345
00:16:25,719 --> 00:16:27,599
I cooked some soft noodles
in bone broth.

346
00:16:27,599 --> 00:16:29,160
- Eat it while it's hot.
- Okay.

347
00:16:29,160 --> 00:16:29,719
Mingzhu.

348
00:16:29,960 --> 00:16:32,320
I want a bowl too.
My stomach hasn't been great lately.

349
00:16:32,320 --> 00:16:33,560
I want something soft too.

350
00:16:33,639 --> 00:16:34,519
There's some for you.

351
00:16:34,759 --> 00:16:35,759
Why don't you eat first?

352
00:16:36,040 --> 00:16:37,040
Here, eat.

353
00:16:45,920 --> 00:16:46,599
What's wrong?

354
00:16:48,479 --> 00:16:49,680
It smells gamey.

355
00:16:50,879 --> 00:16:52,879
Mingzhu probably forgot
the scallions and ginger.

356
00:16:53,280 --> 00:16:54,239
Tell her.

357
00:16:54,839 --> 00:16:56,400
You tell her yourself.

358
00:16:56,400 --> 00:16:58,239
No. You tell her.

359
00:16:58,680 --> 00:16:59,800
Feng Meiqi.

360
00:17:00,040 --> 00:17:01,359
Who have you ever been scared of?

361
00:17:03,479 --> 00:17:04,160
Mingzhu.

362
00:17:04,960 --> 00:17:07,400
Did you forget the scallions and ginger?

363
00:17:08,799 --> 00:17:09,759
I didn't.

364
00:17:14,160 --> 00:17:14,880
I didn't.

365
00:17:15,400 --> 00:17:15,999
She didn't.

366
00:17:25,319 --> 00:17:25,999
Lu Bing.

367
00:17:26,600 --> 00:17:27,719
You're alone today?

368
00:17:28,680 --> 00:17:29,400
Where's Minghui?

369
00:17:34,799 --> 00:17:36,279
Did you see his video?

370
00:17:37,360 --> 00:17:39,479
He neglects his study to make money.

371
00:17:39,999 --> 00:17:41,360
I'm telling you, kids like him

372
00:17:41,360 --> 00:17:43,079
will probably end up a scammer.

373
00:17:43,360 --> 00:17:45,079
All this food,
and you still can't shut up.

374
00:17:45,960 --> 00:17:46,600
What?

375
00:17:48,079 --> 00:17:49,319
Talking about him upsets you?

376
00:17:55,200 --> 00:17:56,039
What?

377
00:17:56,920 --> 00:17:58,079
Don't want people to know?

378
00:18:04,519 --> 00:18:06,479
Have you seen the video

379
00:18:06,640 --> 00:18:08,160
of Shen Minghui from Class 2 Senior 3?

380
00:18:08,160 --> 00:18:09,239
- Yes.
- Yes.

381
00:18:09,239 --> 00:18:11,680
He neglects his study to make money.

382
00:18:12,239 --> 00:18:14,160
Isn't he obsessed with money?

383
00:18:14,160 --> 00:18:17,759
Money-Grubber Shen.

384
00:18:17,759 --> 00:18:18,450
Money-Grubber...

385
00:18:23,060 --> 00:18:24,360
Believe it or not, I'll hit you.

386
00:18:25,600 --> 00:18:26,360
What are you doing?

387
00:18:26,360 --> 00:18:27,810
Have you no shame in hitting a girl?

388
00:18:27,840 --> 00:18:28,719
Are you even a man?

389
00:18:28,719 --> 00:18:30,479
Ignore him. You can't beat him anyway.

390
00:18:30,480 --> 00:18:31,910
I'm afraid of hitting your brother.

391
00:18:31,920 --> 00:18:33,079
I can't beat him?

392
00:18:34,680 --> 00:18:35,759
Go. Hit him.

393
00:18:35,880 --> 00:18:37,319
Shen Minghui, stop bragging. Come on.

394
00:18:37,360 --> 00:18:38,440
Hit another one and show me.

395
00:18:38,440 --> 00:18:39,200
Hit me again.

396
00:18:40,239 --> 00:18:41,120
Calm down.

397
00:18:51,079 --> 00:18:52,400
(Teachers' Office)
My son was shoved

398
00:18:52,759 --> 00:18:53,960
headfirst into the slop bucket.

399
00:18:54,079 --> 00:18:54,960
A slop bucket.

400
00:18:55,440 --> 00:18:57,319
He's an 18 or 19 years old.

401
00:18:57,400 --> 00:18:58,600
What about his pride?

402
00:18:59,079 --> 00:19:00,400
Gaokao's coming up!

403
00:19:00,400 --> 00:19:01,440
What if his grades tank?

404
00:19:01,440 --> 00:19:02,600
You think he's like him?

405
00:19:02,600 --> 00:19:03,850
Repeating senior year for five years?

406
00:19:03,880 --> 00:19:05,719
Xiaobo's dad, calm down.

407
00:19:05,719 --> 00:19:06,680
You have to trust us.

408
00:19:06,680 --> 00:19:08,600
We'll handle this properly.

409
00:19:08,600 --> 00:19:09,719
Handle?

410
00:19:09,799 --> 00:19:10,519
I'm telling you

411
00:19:10,519 --> 00:19:11,640
He must be expelled.

412
00:19:12,440 --> 00:19:12,999
No.

413
00:19:13,200 --> 00:19:13,999
Xiaobo's dad.

414
00:19:14,640 --> 00:19:15,200
Xiaobo...

415
00:19:17,600 --> 00:19:18,279
Xiaobo's dad.

416
00:19:18,279 --> 00:19:19,239
Calm down.

417
00:19:19,479 --> 00:19:20,840
Trust the school.

418
00:19:30,440 --> 00:19:31,079
Come in.

419
00:19:43,479 --> 00:19:44,279
Mr. Hu.

420
00:19:45,200 --> 00:19:45,920
I'm sorry.

421
00:19:45,920 --> 00:19:48,239
What good is apologizing to me?

422
00:19:49,200 --> 00:19:49,880
How about this?

423
00:19:50,600 --> 00:19:52,840
Apologize to Fan Xiaobo properly.

424
00:19:53,440 --> 00:19:55,200
We'll smooth things over
with his parents.

425
00:19:55,200 --> 00:19:56,079
I'm not apologizing.

426
00:19:56,600 --> 00:19:57,400
He deserved it.

427
00:19:57,479 --> 00:19:59,640
Didn't you hear what his dad said?

428
00:19:59,719 --> 00:20:00,840
He wants you expelled.

429
00:20:00,840 --> 00:20:02,200
Expel me then.

430
00:20:03,960 --> 00:20:05,200
Are you out of your mind?

431
00:20:05,479 --> 00:20:06,759
Gaokao is coming up.

432
00:20:06,759 --> 00:20:08,759
Life isn't only about gaokao.

433
00:20:08,759 --> 00:20:11,239
But yours is about to end.

434
00:20:11,319 --> 00:20:12,680
Hang in there just a bit more.

435
00:20:12,680 --> 00:20:13,880
And you'll finish it.

436
00:20:13,880 --> 00:20:15,960
I've already tried gritting my teeth.

437
00:20:16,200 --> 00:20:17,840
My mock 3 results
were worse than mock 2.

438
00:20:19,680 --> 00:20:21,840
My mom forced me
to study at Nanzhou High

439
00:20:21,840 --> 00:20:22,999
for five years already.

440
00:20:26,400 --> 00:20:27,200
Mr. Hu.

441
00:20:28,600 --> 00:20:31,120
I watched you grow up.

442
00:20:32,999 --> 00:20:34,759
Be honest. Am I cut out for studying?

443
00:20:34,759 --> 00:20:36,120
Shen Minghui.

444
00:20:36,120 --> 00:20:37,759
You need confidence.

445
00:20:37,759 --> 00:20:39,719
You just haven't figured it out yet.

446
00:20:39,759 --> 00:20:40,479
Hu Gang.

447
00:20:40,640 --> 00:20:42,759
Can you not lie through your teeth?

448
00:20:43,279 --> 00:20:44,759
Shen Minghui hasn't figured it out?

449
00:20:44,799 --> 00:20:45,960
Can't you see?

450
00:20:45,960 --> 00:20:46,880
He set this up.

451
00:20:46,880 --> 00:20:48,400
He even got you involved.

452
00:20:52,479 --> 00:20:53,239
Shen Minghui.

453
00:20:53,479 --> 00:20:54,519
Tell me the truth.

454
00:20:54,840 --> 00:20:56,680
Did you fight on purpose
to get expelled?

455
00:20:56,680 --> 00:20:57,239
Speak.

456
00:20:58,719 --> 00:20:59,600
None of your business.

457
00:21:03,239 --> 00:21:03,840
I...

458
00:21:06,680 --> 00:21:07,440
You...

459
00:21:09,360 --> 00:21:09,880
What?

460
00:21:10,999 --> 00:21:11,880
You got expelled?

461
00:21:13,999 --> 00:21:15,400
I never wanted to study anyway.

462
00:21:16,200 --> 00:21:17,440
Isn't this great, Dad?

463
00:21:18,400 --> 00:21:19,079
You brat!

464
00:21:19,759 --> 00:21:20,759
Shen Minghui!

465
00:21:21,920 --> 00:21:23,200
Are you looking for trouble?

466
00:21:23,200 --> 00:21:24,160
How could you?

467
00:21:24,600 --> 00:21:25,519
How could you?

468
00:21:25,519 --> 00:21:27,239
Are you trying to

469
00:21:27,239 --> 00:21:28,999
piss your dad off?

470
00:21:30,160 --> 00:21:31,279
Stop.

471
00:21:31,640 --> 00:21:33,239
Beating him won't fix anything.

472
00:21:33,880 --> 00:21:36,920
It's my fault. I spoiled him.

473
00:21:38,999 --> 00:21:39,600
Mom.

474
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:41,759
Even without school,
I can do other things.

475
00:21:41,759 --> 00:21:43,120
You're quite proud, aren't you?

476
00:21:43,999 --> 00:21:45,400
Go get me a rope.

477
00:21:47,640 --> 00:21:48,840
You can't even go one day

478
00:21:48,999 --> 00:21:51,400
without causing trouble.

479
00:21:51,400 --> 00:21:52,160
This kid...

480
00:21:54,519 --> 00:21:56,350
You're completely useless.

481
00:21:56,360 --> 00:21:58,279
Are you okay?
Do you need to go to the hospital?

482
00:21:58,279 --> 00:21:59,279
I'm too scared to move.

483
00:22:03,999 --> 00:22:05,239
Give it to me. I can carry it.

484
00:22:05,319 --> 00:22:06,279
It's fine.

485
00:22:06,279 --> 00:22:07,319
Keep your voice down.

486
00:22:22,160 --> 00:22:23,920
You're not saying bye to Mom and Dad?

487
00:22:24,239 --> 00:22:25,160
Forget it.

488
00:22:25,360 --> 00:22:26,680
They're still furious.

489
00:22:26,740 --> 00:22:27,719
Wait till they cool off.

490
00:22:27,719 --> 00:22:29,120
Then we'll come back and apologize.

491
00:22:29,759 --> 00:22:30,400
Let's go.

492
00:22:38,640 --> 00:22:39,200
Go.

493
00:22:41,600 --> 00:22:42,880
Careful, watch the steps.

494
00:22:43,160 --> 00:22:43,719
I'm fine.

495
00:23:28,360 --> 00:23:29,160
Do you regret it?

496
00:23:31,640 --> 00:23:32,559
Regret?

497
00:23:33,360 --> 00:23:35,160
Following your wife is never wrong.

498
00:23:43,640 --> 00:23:44,960
I need to learn...

499
00:23:45,880 --> 00:23:48,440
Learn to take care of my wife and child.

500
00:24:00,239 --> 00:24:00,799
Here.

501
00:24:01,319 --> 00:24:02,120
Let me feed you.

502
00:24:12,160 --> 00:24:13,079
Dad, Mom.

503
00:24:14,400 --> 00:24:15,079
You're back.

504
00:24:16,210 --> 00:24:17,519
Dad, what happened to your hand?

505
00:24:18,880 --> 00:24:20,039
How did it get like this?

506
00:24:23,360 --> 00:24:24,360
Your brother.

507
00:24:25,079 --> 00:24:26,880
He got mad and smashed things,

508
00:24:26,880 --> 00:24:27,759
hurting his own hand.

509
00:24:28,239 --> 00:24:29,559
Did you go to the hospital?

510
00:24:29,719 --> 00:24:30,880
No.

511
00:24:31,460 --> 00:24:32,519
It's probably not broken.

512
00:24:33,079 --> 00:24:34,719
Where's Minghui? School?

513
00:24:34,840 --> 00:24:36,880
School? I couldn't wake
him no matter what.

514
00:24:36,880 --> 00:24:37,479
He wouldn't go.

515
00:24:37,480 --> 00:24:38,650
No one could talk him into it.

516
00:24:38,820 --> 00:24:39,999
No one could talk him into it.

517
00:24:40,039 --> 00:24:41,680
You spoiled him.

518
00:24:43,760 --> 00:24:44,680
Give him money packets.

519
00:24:45,279 --> 00:24:46,120
You too.

520
00:24:46,360 --> 00:24:47,880
What do you want to eat, son?

521
00:24:48,719 --> 00:24:49,559
Just spoil him.

522
00:24:49,719 --> 00:24:51,039
Look what he is now.

523
00:24:51,079 --> 00:24:52,120
He behaves like a lord.

524
00:24:52,640 --> 00:24:53,799
You didn't spoil him?

525
00:24:53,960 --> 00:24:56,200
Your daughter gives a money packet,
so it's spoiling him?

526
00:24:56,200 --> 00:24:57,640
Last time I told you to hit him.

527
00:24:57,640 --> 00:24:59,640
Did you even lift a finger?

528
00:24:59,640 --> 00:25:00,840
Now that something happened,

529
00:25:00,840 --> 00:25:02,360
you blame us.

530
00:25:02,719 --> 00:25:03,479
Enough.

531
00:25:08,079 --> 00:25:11,239
I was thinking
we could go to the school together

532
00:25:11,239 --> 00:25:11,960
and beg them.

533
00:25:11,960 --> 00:25:13,279
If you want to go, go yourselves.

534
00:25:14,360 --> 00:25:15,160
I'm not going.

535
00:25:17,920 --> 00:25:19,519
Minghui's over 20,

536
00:25:20,039 --> 00:25:21,239
yet he's still in high school.

537
00:25:22,840 --> 00:25:24,799
Even if they don't expel him,

538
00:25:25,600 --> 00:25:27,319
what is he going to do after gaokao?

539
00:25:28,120 --> 00:25:29,719
He'll do Senior 6 again next year?

540
00:25:30,039 --> 00:25:30,840
No, you see.

541
00:25:31,840 --> 00:25:33,880
He should at least get a diploma.

542
00:25:33,880 --> 00:25:35,200
Otherwise, what is he going to do?

543
00:25:35,200 --> 00:25:36,960
Minghui's just bad at studying.

544
00:25:37,200 --> 00:25:39,319
He can handle everything else.

545
00:25:39,680 --> 00:25:40,840
He knows it too.

546
00:25:40,840 --> 00:25:42,440
He's not cut out for studying.

547
00:25:43,120 --> 00:25:44,319
So there's no need

548
00:25:44,400 --> 00:25:46,719
to waste year after year
at Nanzhou High School.

549
00:25:47,319 --> 00:25:48,239
No, he...

550
00:25:48,840 --> 00:25:51,519
Lately he's made progress.

551
00:25:51,799 --> 00:25:53,600
All his grades improved.

552
00:25:53,600 --> 00:25:56,840
He just did badly
on the third mock exam.

553
00:25:56,960 --> 00:25:58,479
It's the third one.

554
00:25:58,920 --> 00:26:00,279
When did he ever do well?

555
00:26:01,600 --> 00:26:02,759
Say tutoring then.

556
00:26:03,120 --> 00:26:05,519
I cooked so much for the tutor.

557
00:26:07,039 --> 00:26:08,279
Wasn't it for him?

558
00:26:11,680 --> 00:26:12,960
Mom, Dad.

559
00:26:13,840 --> 00:26:15,079
You two need to relax.

560
00:26:15,880 --> 00:26:18,200
College isn't like
a kid getting vaccines.

561
00:26:18,400 --> 00:26:19,799
Not everyone needs one.

562
00:26:20,239 --> 00:26:22,279
Minghui not going to college
isn't the end.

563
00:26:22,640 --> 00:26:24,400
He's still alive and kicking.

564
00:26:25,160 --> 00:26:27,840
Isn't it good that he wants
to earn his own living

565
00:26:28,640 --> 00:26:30,120
and be independent?

566
00:26:30,559 --> 00:26:31,880
As long as he lives well,

567
00:26:32,600 --> 00:26:33,519
he can do anything.

568
00:26:36,479 --> 00:26:37,640
No, you...

569
00:26:39,079 --> 00:26:41,239
You're so young. Have you spent

570
00:26:41,239 --> 00:26:42,680
too long outside the ICU?

571
00:26:42,680 --> 00:26:45,799
Why do you talk like someone
who's seen through life?

572
00:26:45,880 --> 00:26:47,200
Stop interrupting.

573
00:26:47,200 --> 00:26:48,920
She's trying to think of a solution.

574
00:26:48,920 --> 00:26:50,559
What ICU nonsense?

575
00:26:54,279 --> 00:26:55,759
Anyway, I've said my piece.

576
00:26:57,079 --> 00:26:58,719
If you still can't accept it,

577
00:26:59,759 --> 00:27:01,079
I'll go with you to the school

578
00:27:01,120 --> 00:27:02,039
and beg the teacher.

579
00:27:02,039 --> 00:27:03,559
- Sure, let's go.
- I'm not going.

580
00:27:04,479 --> 00:27:05,750
If you want to go, go yourselves.

581
00:27:13,719 --> 00:27:14,479
Mingzhu.

582
00:27:14,680 --> 00:27:16,440
I just called Mr. Hu.

583
00:27:16,640 --> 00:27:18,440
He's already intervene for Minghui,

584
00:27:18,999 --> 00:27:21,400
but the school is firm this time.

585
00:27:21,719 --> 00:27:22,999
No one can sway them.

586
00:27:28,799 --> 00:27:29,360
What's wrong?

587
00:27:32,440 --> 00:27:33,160
Mingzhu.

588
00:27:33,440 --> 00:27:35,160
I just called Mr. Hu.

589
00:27:35,360 --> 00:27:37,160
He's already intervene for Minghui,

590
00:27:37,680 --> 00:27:40,039
but the school is firm this time.

591
00:27:40,400 --> 00:27:41,600
No one can sway them.

592
00:27:54,239 --> 00:27:54,759
Dad.

593
00:27:55,759 --> 00:27:56,360
Mom.

594
00:27:59,440 --> 00:28:01,519
I've studied at Nanzhou High
for five years.

595
00:28:04,519 --> 00:28:05,840
You think I'm shameful.

596
00:28:07,880 --> 00:28:09,319
I feel worse.

597
00:28:11,559 --> 00:28:12,999
I wanted to make you proud.

598
00:28:14,920 --> 00:28:15,799
I studied hard.

599
00:28:16,719 --> 00:28:17,719
Really hard.

600
00:28:18,360 --> 00:28:19,759
I really put in effort,

601
00:28:21,239 --> 00:28:22,719
but I'm just bad at it.

602
00:28:23,840 --> 00:28:25,120
I'm not cut for studying.

603
00:28:28,440 --> 00:28:30,640
I want to do something I truly like.

604
00:28:31,840 --> 00:28:33,400
I sold pork chops at school.

605
00:28:34,079 --> 00:28:35,440
I streamed online.

606
00:28:36,640 --> 00:28:38,200
You all saw it.

607
00:28:40,160 --> 00:28:41,350
I can still earn a good living

608
00:28:42,279 --> 00:28:43,999
and support you

609
00:28:45,300 --> 00:28:46,519
even if I don't go to college.

610
00:28:49,400 --> 00:28:50,440
I'm grown now.

611
00:28:52,400 --> 00:28:53,479
I want to decide

612
00:28:54,239 --> 00:28:55,519
my life myself.

613
00:28:59,479 --> 00:29:00,160
Minghui.

614
00:29:00,600 --> 00:29:01,559
I sorted

615
00:29:01,640 --> 00:29:02,999
these textbooks for you.

616
00:29:03,680 --> 00:29:05,079
Look through them when you can.

617
00:29:05,279 --> 00:29:07,799
Learning lasts a lifetime.

618
00:29:07,799 --> 00:29:08,880
Thank you, Mr. Hu.

619
00:29:09,920 --> 00:29:10,759
I'm sorry.

620
00:29:11,039 --> 00:29:13,120
I couldn't keep you in school.

621
00:29:13,120 --> 00:29:14,239
It's fine, Mr. Hu.

622
00:29:14,559 --> 00:29:15,680
It's not your fault.

623
00:29:16,999 --> 00:29:17,999
Cheer up.

624
00:29:18,580 --> 00:29:20,319
I'll still drink
at your and Ni's wedding.

625
00:29:20,319 --> 00:29:21,479
Drink my foot.

626
00:29:23,479 --> 00:29:24,160
We're off.

627
00:29:35,160 --> 00:29:35,880
Shen Minghui!

628
00:29:35,880 --> 00:29:37,120
We're one short. Come on.

629
00:29:38,400 --> 00:29:39,440
Play another game.

630
00:29:39,440 --> 00:29:40,200
I'll accompany you.

631
00:29:41,600 --> 00:29:42,239
No.

632
00:29:43,360 --> 00:29:44,039
Let's go.

633
00:29:47,559 --> 00:29:48,960
Shen Minghui!

634
00:29:49,360 --> 00:29:51,840
You finally
don't have to repeat Senior 6!

635
00:29:52,079 --> 00:29:53,519
Keep it low-key.

636
00:29:57,200 --> 00:29:57,999
Shen Minghui.

637
00:30:00,600 --> 00:30:01,360
Fan Xiaobo's dad.

638
00:30:02,880 --> 00:30:05,440
You don't think you're safe
after hitting my son, do you?

639
00:30:05,440 --> 00:30:06,200
What do you want?

640
00:30:06,200 --> 00:30:07,200
Xiaobo's dad.

641
00:30:07,680 --> 00:30:08,479
I'm sorry.

642
00:30:08,759 --> 00:30:10,519
I wanted to find a chance to apologize.

643
00:30:11,319 --> 00:30:13,640
My brother has been expelled already.

644
00:30:16,600 --> 00:30:17,799
Serves him right.

645
00:30:19,239 --> 00:30:20,160
Minghui, let's go.

646
00:30:21,079 --> 00:30:21,640
Stop.

647
00:30:21,660 --> 00:30:22,440
What are you doing?

648
00:30:22,440 --> 00:30:23,319
What do you want?

649
00:30:23,840 --> 00:30:24,960
What do I want?

650
00:30:26,640 --> 00:30:29,239
You think you can bully my son
and walk away?

651
00:30:30,440 --> 00:30:31,400
Let me tell you.

652
00:30:31,559 --> 00:30:32,360
This matter

653
00:30:32,680 --> 00:30:33,360
is not over!

654
00:30:33,999 --> 00:30:34,680
You brat.

655
00:30:34,680 --> 00:30:36,279
- What are you doing?
- What do you want?

656
00:30:36,279 --> 00:30:36,799
Mingzhu!

657
00:30:37,079 --> 00:30:38,799
My brother is expelled already.

658
00:30:38,799 --> 00:30:40,680
Your son bullies everyone at school.

659
00:30:40,680 --> 00:30:41,999
Someone should've taught him
a lesson sooner.

660
00:30:41,999 --> 00:30:43,600
What? You want to hit him?

661
00:30:43,759 --> 00:30:45,239
If you touch my brother again,

662
00:30:45,239 --> 00:30:46,440
I'll fight you to death!

663
00:30:47,840 --> 00:30:48,360
I...

664
00:30:48,360 --> 00:30:49,400
You what?

665
00:30:50,519 --> 00:30:51,400
Let me tell you.

666
00:30:52,160 --> 00:30:53,079
I'm a good man.

667
00:30:54,120 --> 00:30:55,320
I won't fight a pregnant woman!

668
00:30:59,719 --> 00:31:00,600
You brat.

669
00:31:00,600 --> 00:31:01,519
Just you wait.

670
00:31:01,719 --> 00:31:02,719
This isn't over.

671
00:31:03,840 --> 00:31:04,559
Just you wait.

672
00:31:10,400 --> 00:31:10,999
Let's go.

673
00:31:11,600 --> 00:31:12,680
I'm here. Don't worry.

674
00:31:16,319 --> 00:31:16,920
Mingzhu.

675
00:31:17,519 --> 00:31:18,600
You're pregnant.

676
00:31:19,079 --> 00:31:20,999
Stay away from stuff like this.

677
00:31:21,239 --> 00:31:22,319
I can handle it.

678
00:31:23,400 --> 00:31:24,999
I'm pregnant. Who would I fear?

679
00:31:27,239 --> 00:31:27,840
Mingzhu.

680
00:31:28,519 --> 00:31:29,759
I'll protect you from now on.

681
00:31:31,719 --> 00:31:32,759
You too.

682
00:31:39,999 --> 00:31:40,600
Class.

683
00:31:41,680 --> 00:31:43,960
Light frequency is set by the source.

684
00:31:44,360 --> 00:31:46,880
Speed of light
depends on the refractive index.

685
00:31:47,200 --> 00:31:49,440
Wavelength
depends on the refractive index

686
00:31:49,559 --> 00:31:51,559
and the frequency together.

687
00:31:52,479 --> 00:31:53,920
This is also an important

688
00:31:53,920 --> 00:31:55,840
gaokao exam point.

689
00:32:01,920 --> 00:32:03,360
You don't taste it?

690
00:32:03,559 --> 00:32:04,479
It's fine, Dad.

691
00:32:05,039 --> 00:32:06,440
Thicken the sauce.

692
00:32:07,160 --> 00:32:08,440
Go sit down and rest.

693
00:32:08,440 --> 00:32:09,519
Go mind your things.

694
00:32:09,680 --> 00:32:11,559
Add a spoon of sugar to boost flavor.

695
00:32:11,960 --> 00:32:12,519
Here.

696
00:32:13,559 --> 00:32:14,200
Mr. Shen.

697
00:32:14,200 --> 00:32:15,200
Give me a cigarette.

698
00:32:16,160 --> 00:32:16,999
Sit.

699
00:32:16,999 --> 00:32:17,319
Okay.

700
00:32:17,319 --> 00:32:18,759
Don't be shy. Here.

701
00:32:20,210 --> 00:32:22,479
Boss. You'll be living easy
now that your son takes over.

702
00:32:22,680 --> 00:32:23,759
Living easy?

703
00:32:23,759 --> 00:32:25,360
He's inexperienced. He still needs work.

704
00:32:27,120 --> 00:32:27,600
Not bad.

705
00:32:27,600 --> 00:32:28,840
Has some potential, right?

706
00:32:32,680 --> 00:32:33,440
Hello, Mr. Shen.

707
00:32:34,760 --> 00:32:35,440
Hello, Mrs. Shen.

708
00:32:35,440 --> 00:32:36,640
- Hello, Mrs. Shen.
- Lu Bing is here.

709
00:32:36,719 --> 00:32:37,920
I'm here to see Minghui.

710
00:32:38,479 --> 00:32:39,600
See Minghui? Okay.

711
00:32:40,160 --> 00:32:40,880
Minghui.

712
00:32:41,999 --> 00:32:43,039
Mom, help me cut radish.

713
00:32:45,079 --> 00:32:46,079
Why are you here?

714
00:33:02,920 --> 00:33:05,559
I found several gaokao prep classes.

715
00:33:06,160 --> 00:33:07,960
I organized materials by subject.

716
00:33:08,239 --> 00:33:10,200
Take them home and study well.

717
00:33:10,250 --> 00:33:11,759
You can increase at least 20 points.

718
00:33:19,440 --> 00:33:20,559
I don't need them.

719
00:33:23,960 --> 00:33:24,920
I've decided.

720
00:33:27,600 --> 00:33:29,160
I'm not cut for studying.

721
00:33:31,160 --> 00:33:32,850
We're not cut
from the same cloth either.

722
00:33:34,160 --> 00:33:35,160
In the future,

723
00:33:35,840 --> 00:33:37,319
you go to Peking University.

724
00:33:38,120 --> 00:33:39,559
I'll marinate my chops.

725
00:33:40,360 --> 00:33:41,840
What does that mean?

726
00:33:47,999 --> 00:33:49,319
Hurry back to night study.

727
00:33:49,960 --> 00:33:52,239
Study well and do your gaokao well.

728
00:33:53,239 --> 00:33:53,920
I won't

729
00:33:57,479 --> 00:33:58,680
bother you again.

730
00:34:21,360 --> 00:34:22,199
Not bad.

731
00:34:23,720 --> 00:34:24,240
Good.

732
00:34:24,400 --> 00:34:25,599
- Thanks.
- Pickles.

733
00:34:27,240 --> 00:34:28,159
Here, drink.

734
00:34:28,159 --> 00:34:28,760
Cheers.

735
00:34:37,559 --> 00:34:38,240
How did it go?

736
00:34:38,720 --> 00:34:39,920
What did Lu Bing say?

737
00:34:40,280 --> 00:34:41,199

(Zhixia Speaks)
You borrowed me 50,000 yuan.

800
00:38:15,679 --> 00:38:18,039
30,000 yuan is from your dad
selling his motorcycle.

801
00:38:18,360 --> 00:38:20,159
A total of 80,000 yuan.
Count it yourself.

802
00:38:24,280 --> 00:38:25,599
Where did you get so much money?

803
00:38:26,320 --> 00:38:28,320
My father-in-law
bought an insurance policy.

804
00:38:29,039 --> 00:38:29,760
And

805
00:38:31,240 --> 00:38:32,559
his mistress

806
00:38:32,840 --> 00:38:34,240
sold the house in her hometown

807
00:38:34,240 --> 00:38:35,360
and gave us half.

808
00:38:38,360 --> 00:38:38,960
Well...

809
00:38:39,840 --> 00:38:42,240
I can't say
she's noble and virtuous, right?

810
00:38:42,990 --> 00:38:44,840
She also shared
part of the insurance money.

811
00:38:45,199 --> 00:38:47,079
In short, we divided the inheritance

812
00:38:47,159 --> 00:38:48,199
according to the law.

813
00:38:50,360 --> 00:38:51,360
I'm leaving.

814
00:38:51,360 --> 00:38:51,840
Don't.

815
00:38:52,559 --> 00:38:53,199
Mingzhu.

816
00:38:54,280 --> 00:38:55,280
Take this money.

817
00:38:55,280 --> 00:38:56,840
This is a token from our whole family.

818
00:38:57,960 --> 00:38:59,720
You helped me when I was at my hardest.

819
00:38:59,720 --> 00:39:01,199
I'm already very grateful.

820
00:39:01,479 --> 00:39:03,240
And this isn't a small sum of money.

821
00:39:03,880 --> 00:39:04,720
Besides,

822
00:39:05,280 --> 00:39:07,280
even sisters should keep accounts clear.

823
00:39:11,360 --> 00:39:13,039

824
00:39:13,360 --> 00:39:14,240
I know.

825
00:39:14,880 --> 00:39:16,760
I know your situation very well.

826
00:39:17,519 --> 00:39:17,960
You

827
00:39:18,119 --> 00:39:19,840
should think a bit more for yourself.

828
00:39:19,960 --> 00:39:21,650
This money
isn't given to you for nothing.

829
00:39:21,679 --> 00:39:24,039
Jiao has never had
a dedicated piano teacher.

830
00:39:24,199 --> 00:39:26,599
I now officially hire Ms. Shen Mingzhu

831
00:39:26,599 --> 00:39:28,760
as Jiao's exclusive piano tutor.

832
00:39:28,880 --> 00:39:30,240
This is your advance salary.

833
00:39:30,479 --> 00:39:31,840
Teaching piano is fine.

834
00:39:32,479 --> 00:39:33,800
She's my niece.

835
00:39:33,800 --> 00:39:34,840
Why mention money to me?

836
00:39:38,360 --> 00:39:41,720
Now we're truly noble and virtuous.

837
00:39:55,840 --> 00:39:56,800
You must know

838
00:39:56,800 --> 00:39:58,039
that one jin of pork belly

839
00:39:58,360 --> 00:40:00,360
can make at least eight meatballs.

840
00:40:01,119 --> 00:40:02,840
When mixing the filling,

841
00:40:03,260 --> 00:40:04,360
it must be in one direction.

842
00:40:04,360 --> 00:40:05,240

843
00:40:05,440 --> 00:40:06,280

Yes.

847
00:40:10,479 --> 00:40:12,039
How's the recovery going?

848
00:40:12,039 --> 00:40:14,360
Pretty good. I'm fine.

849
00:40:14,360 --> 00:40:15,760
You're fine? Hurry.

850
00:40:15,760 --> 00:40:16,519
- Sit.
- Okay.

851
00:40:16,760 --> 00:40:18,079

852
00:40:18,079 --> 00:40:19,119
Yes.

853
00:40:19,119 --> 00:40:19,760
Sit.

855
00:40:20,559 --> 00:40:21,599

856
00:40:21,760 --> 00:40:22,840
Taste my cooking.

857
00:40:22,840 --> 00:40:23,840
Sure.

858
00:40:25,119 --> 00:40:26,639
Don't bother.

859
00:40:27,240 --> 00:40:28,039
Here, have some tea.

862
00:40:37,360 --> 00:40:38,999
No, what's this for?

863
00:40:39,079 --> 00:40:39,760
Thank you.

864
00:40:39,760 --> 00:40:41,159

865
00:40:41,880 --> 00:40:42,720

867
00:41:03,720 --> 00:41:04,360
Mingzhu.

868
00:41:04,599 --> 00:41:05,440
Why are you here?

869
00:41:06,159 --> 00:41:07,720
I called you so many times.

870
00:41:07,720 --> 00:41:08,720
You didn't answer.

871
00:41:10,240 --> 00:41:11,440
I was in a meeting just now.

872
00:41:11,440 --> 00:41:12,920
Maybe I couldn't pick up.

873
00:41:13,400 --> 00:41:15,360
I know you're avoiding me on purpose.

874
00:41:15,920 --> 00:41:17,440
But I really need this job.

875
00:41:17,440 --> 00:41:20,159
I know that once my maternity leave
ends, I'll lose this job.

876
00:41:20,320 --> 00:41:21,760
Can you help me?

877
00:41:21,960 --> 00:41:23,679
Even if you come back now,
there's no job.

878
00:41:23,679 --> 00:41:26,199
There's no position available.
And you're pregnant.

879
00:41:26,440 --> 00:41:28,199
I'm pregnant, not sick.

880
00:41:28,440 --> 00:41:29,159
I can work.

881
00:41:29,159 --> 00:41:31,559
I can handle any department and any job.

882
00:41:32,990 --> 00:41:34,400
Okay, I understand your situation.

883
00:41:34,400 --> 00:41:36,159
Let me check
with the higher‑ups first. Alright?

884
00:41:36,159 --> 00:41:37,150
Let's leave it at that for now.

885
00:41:37,320 --> 00:41:37,920
Mr. Zhao.

886
00:41:38,559 --> 00:41:40,360
When can you give me an answer?

887
00:41:41,240 --> 00:41:43,159
I really need this job.

888
00:41:43,280 --> 00:41:44,240
I need the money.

889
00:41:48,039 --> 00:41:48,679
Mingzhu.

890
00:41:49,639 --> 00:41:50,880
Let me be honest with you.

891
00:41:51,639 --> 00:41:54,199
The hotel is currently
full of old employees.

892
00:41:54,440 --> 00:41:56,240
Business is bad, the burden is heavy.

893
00:41:57,240 --> 00:41:59,440
The themed wedding you did
before did well,

894
00:41:59,440 --> 00:42:01,599
but that's just a drop in the bucket.

895
00:42:01,860 --> 00:42:03,199
It doesn't solve the real problem.

896
00:42:03,199 --> 00:42:04,400
I can keep doing it.

897
00:42:04,400 --> 00:42:05,599
I can scale it up.

898
00:42:06,440 --> 00:42:07,800
The restaurant's too old-fashioned.

899
00:42:08,400 --> 00:42:09,390
The wiring is aging.

900
00:42:09,400 --> 00:42:10,920
There's a short circuit every few days.

901
00:42:10,920 --> 00:42:12,440
The ceiling is about to fall apart.

902
00:42:12,440 --> 00:42:13,920
They're all safety hazards.

903
00:42:14,119 --> 00:42:15,679
If something goes wrong,

904
00:42:15,880 --> 00:42:17,559
we'll pay more than we earn.

905
00:42:18,119 --> 00:42:19,880
Then I can go to another department.

906
00:42:20,060 --> 00:42:21,360
I have an accounting certificate.

907
00:42:21,519 --> 00:42:22,320
I can do finance.

908
00:42:22,320 --> 00:42:23,240
Mingzhu.

909
00:42:24,159 --> 00:42:26,559
Everyone's cutting costs
and raising efficiency now.

910
00:42:26,999 --> 00:42:29,320
Who's going to hire a pregnant woman?

911
00:42:29,460 --> 00:42:30,880
You won't be able to work for long.

912
00:42:30,880 --> 00:42:32,240
You'll go on maternity leave soon.

913
00:42:32,880 --> 00:42:34,720
So what if I'm pregnant?

914
00:42:35,999 --> 00:42:38,280
Wasn't everyone born by a mother?

915
00:42:39,360 --> 00:42:40,910
Why is it that the moment I'm pregnant,

916
00:42:41,240 --> 00:42:43,229
nobody wants me anymore?
