=Those Days=

00:01:12,431 --> 00:01:14,800
(Adapted from iceread.com novel
"You Xi" by Qingyang Wanxi)

3
00:01:15,220 --> 00:01:17,780
=Episode 5=

4
00:01:23,319 --> 00:01:24,399
What did you tell me?

5
00:01:24,520 --> 00:01:26,071
You told me it was a business trip,

6
00:01:26,330 --> 00:01:28,448
and now I see you went on holiday
with another man!

7
00:01:28,448 --> 00:01:29,960
If that's not cheating, what is it?

8
00:01:30,279 --> 00:01:31,679
Stop calling me already!

9
00:01:31,679 --> 00:01:33,279
I'm busy with work.

10
00:01:33,279 --> 00:01:34,360
Stop clinging to me!

11
00:01:34,360 --> 00:01:36,640
Let's at least leave
something good between us, all right?

12
00:01:37,240 --> 00:01:38,279
Huh? All right?

13
00:01:38,279 --> 00:01:39,240
Stop calling me!

14
00:01:52,160 --> 00:01:53,160
So, she cheated.

15
00:01:54,640 --> 00:01:55,759
Not a big deal.

16
00:02:06,399 --> 00:02:08,360
Patient No. 49, Shen Mingzhu,

17
00:02:08,360 --> 00:02:10,240
please proceed
to consultation room No. 8.

18
00:02:15,399 --> 00:02:15,919
You...

19
00:02:17,880 --> 00:02:18,520
Hello.

20
00:02:24,879 --> 00:02:25,800
What are you here for?

21
00:02:27,559 --> 00:02:28,559
I'm nine weeks pregnant.

22
00:02:29,480 --> 00:02:31,040
Things have been rough at home lately.

23
00:02:31,839 --> 00:02:33,119
My sleep's a mess,

24
00:02:33,399 --> 00:02:34,520
and I've been in a poor mood.

25
00:02:35,599 --> 00:02:37,040
I'm worried it might affect the baby,

26
00:02:37,040 --> 00:02:38,279
so I came for a check-up.

27
00:02:38,399 --> 00:02:39,599
That's due to hormones.

28
00:02:40,080 --> 00:02:42,320
It's normal for pregnant women
to have mood swings.

29
00:02:43,679 --> 00:02:44,760
It's a cornual pregnancy.

30
00:02:45,800 --> 00:02:46,999
Is that serious?

31
00:02:47,071 --> 00:02:49,204
Yours is on the left front side,
so it's not too bad.

32
00:02:49,204 --> 00:02:50,760
Try lying more on your right side,

33
00:02:50,760 --> 00:02:52,671
and see if it helps the baby
move into position.

34
00:02:52,879 --> 00:02:54,119
But you need close follow-ups.

35
00:02:56,399 --> 00:02:58,360
And if it doesn't develop properly?

36
00:03:00,879 --> 00:03:02,200
Then the baby might not make it.

37
00:03:02,320 --> 00:03:03,560
You'd need to have an abortion

38
00:03:03,626 --> 00:03:04,693
as soon as possible.

39
00:03:09,999 --> 00:03:11,760
I'm just giving you
the worst-case scenario,

40
00:03:11,760 --> 00:03:12,760
so don't worry too much.

41
00:03:13,159 --> 00:03:14,640
A mother's good mood matters most.

42
00:03:14,719 --> 00:03:16,080
I'll prescribe you some folic acid.

43
00:03:16,279 --> 00:03:17,520
Come back in two weeks.

44
00:03:21,119 --> 00:03:23,182
What are you doing?
What do you think you're doing?

45
00:03:23,182 --> 00:03:24,640
We'd like to interview Shen Mingzhu.

46
00:03:24,640 --> 00:03:26,190
A hospital is not your place
for interviews!

47
00:03:26,204 --> 00:03:27,329
It's a legitimate interview.

48
00:03:27,330 --> 00:03:28,590
Shen Mingzhu, is your baby healthy?

49
00:03:28,599 --> 00:03:31,200
May I ask if you're under any pressure
or facing difficulties right now?

50
00:03:31,200 --> 00:03:32,426
Security, get them out of here!

51
00:03:32,426 --> 00:03:33,560
The doctor hit someone!

52
00:03:33,640 --> 00:03:34,480
Let go of me!

53
00:03:34,480 --> 00:03:35,520
You're

54
00:03:35,679 --> 00:03:37,119
a parent now too.

55
00:03:37,119 --> 00:03:39,559
How do you feel about the parents
who abandoned you back then?

56
00:03:40,293 --> 00:03:41,760
What are you doing?
I'll expose you!

57
00:03:41,760 --> 00:03:42,839
- The doctor hit someone!
- Let's go!

58
00:03:42,839 --> 00:03:44,200
I'll expose you!

59
00:03:44,399 --> 00:03:45,640
I'll expose you!

60
00:03:46,119 --> 00:03:46,760
We...

61
00:03:46,893 --> 00:03:48,271
We have the right to interview!

62
00:03:48,271 --> 00:03:50,140
Security,
don't let these people in ever again!

63
00:04:00,999 --> 00:04:01,760
Are you all right?

64
00:04:03,119 --> 00:04:03,839
I'm fine.

65
00:04:07,920 --> 00:04:08,960
Thank you, Dr. Li.

66
00:04:10,999 --> 00:04:12,599
I needed an outlet.

67
00:04:22,839 --> 00:04:24,320
Hard times will pass.

68
00:04:38,980 --> 00:04:41,140
(The causes of a cornual pregnancy...)

69
00:04:49,279 --> 00:04:49,919
Mingzhu.

70
00:04:51,560 --> 00:04:52,239
Mrs. Feng.

71
00:04:55,159 --> 00:04:57,080
Have you decided whether

72
00:04:57,760 --> 00:04:58,960
to keep the baby?

73
00:05:01,440 --> 00:05:02,479
Not yet.

74
00:05:04,399 --> 00:05:06,080
The doctor said
it's a cornual pregnancy.

75
00:05:06,848 --> 00:05:08,848
We'll have to wait for the next check-up

76
00:05:09,239 --> 00:05:11,080
to know if the baby's here to stay.

77
00:05:11,239 --> 00:05:12,320
It'll be fine.

78
00:05:12,680 --> 00:05:14,239
The baby will be fine.

79
00:05:14,337 --> 00:05:15,982
We've got strong genes in our family.

80
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:18,520
Jianqi was a healthy boy,

81
00:05:18,520 --> 00:05:20,200
and he was even a swimming champion.

82
00:05:25,080 --> 00:05:25,880
Mingzhu,

83
00:05:27,520 --> 00:05:29,159
this is Jianqi's phone.

84
00:05:30,159 --> 00:05:31,839
You should keep it.

85
00:05:35,880 --> 00:05:36,799
Thank you, Mrs. Feng.

86
00:05:37,279 --> 00:05:38,000
Call "Mother".

87
00:05:38,880 --> 00:05:40,719
You should call me "Mother" now.

88
00:05:42,159 --> 00:05:42,799
Go on.

89
00:05:45,440 --> 00:05:46,919
I'm sorry. I have to go.

90
00:05:51,204 --> 00:05:53,080
When you said you
write everything yourselves,

91
00:05:53,080 --> 00:05:54,080
I didn't believe it.

92
00:05:54,080 --> 00:05:56,220
Didn't expect you to come
for the interview in person.

93
00:05:57,279 --> 00:05:58,599
You need to go beneath the surface

94
00:05:58,599 --> 00:06:00,560
to find something worth writing about.

95
00:06:02,279 --> 00:06:03,880
Must be hard writing all those articles.

96
00:06:04,960 --> 00:06:05,640
Yes.

97
00:06:05,982 --> 00:06:07,710
Our team often
has brainstorming sessions

98
00:06:07,719 --> 00:06:09,399
till past midnight.

99
00:06:10,039 --> 00:06:11,919
You need a good angle.

100
00:06:12,080 --> 00:06:13,479
You can't just follow the crowd.

101
00:06:13,719 --> 00:06:14,880
Those viral pieces

102
00:06:14,880 --> 00:06:16,640
explode like a volcano.

103
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:18,640
Without long nights

104
00:06:18,719 --> 00:06:20,080
and blood and sweat as fuel,

105
00:06:20,080 --> 00:06:21,640
you couldn't possibly pull that off.

106
00:06:22,320 --> 00:06:23,719
Impressive team you have.

107
00:06:23,880 --> 00:06:26,599
Looks like Rufeng Liquor
picked the right partners.

108
00:06:27,520 --> 00:06:28,440
Since you're here

109
00:06:28,448 --> 00:06:30,689
for the interview,
have a taste of our liquor first.

110
00:06:30,690 --> 00:06:32,782
Li Bai's inspiration flowed best
with liquor in hand.

111
00:06:32,790 --> 00:06:33,960
Our article should be steeped

112
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:35,200
in the aroma of liquor, too.

113
00:06:35,440 --> 00:06:36,560
Sorry, Mr. Lu.

114
00:06:36,760 --> 00:06:38,120
Zhixia's pregnant.

115
00:06:38,120 --> 00:06:38,760
Really?

116
00:06:39,120 --> 00:06:39,839
Congratulations!

117
00:06:39,937 --> 00:06:40,720
Thank you, Mr. Lu.

118
00:06:40,720 --> 00:06:43,440
I'll most definitely choose Rufeng
for the baby's one-month celebration.

119
00:06:43,440 --> 00:06:44,560
Excellent choice.

120
00:06:44,982 --> 00:06:46,390
Then, just have half a cup today.

121
00:06:46,760 --> 00:06:47,880
Better not.

122
00:06:48,982 --> 00:06:50,320
What's there to be afraid of?

123
00:06:50,320 --> 00:06:52,360
My mother drank plenty
when she was expecting me.

124
00:06:52,479 --> 00:06:54,760
And look at me.
I even opened a distillery.

125
00:06:55,479 --> 00:06:56,719
Is that true, Mr. Lu?

126
00:06:56,960 --> 00:06:59,039
That's quite the gift.

127
00:07:01,150 --> 00:07:02,382
If you really can't drink,

128
00:07:02,599 --> 00:07:03,440
I won't push.

129
00:07:04,080 --> 00:07:06,000
Drinking's like writing, after all.

130
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:07,000
It takes talent.

131
00:07:07,320 --> 00:07:08,080
No, Mr. Lu.

132
00:07:08,520 --> 00:07:09,279
We must have

133
00:07:09,680 --> 00:07:10,560
the liquor.

134
00:07:10,848 --> 00:07:13,320
Maybe I'll end up raising
a future owner of a distillery, too.

135
00:07:13,320 --> 00:07:13,960
Right, Maodou?

136
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:15,719
All right, then.

137
00:07:15,880 --> 00:07:17,093
You tell me when to stop.

138
00:07:17,320 --> 00:07:17,960
Don't.

139
00:07:18,320 --> 00:07:19,120
Fill it up.

140
00:07:19,382 --> 00:07:20,826
Rufeng Liquor only tastes right full.

141
00:07:21,799 --> 00:07:22,359
Good.

142
00:07:25,719 --> 00:07:26,359
Zhixia.

143
00:07:26,719 --> 00:07:27,520
Thank you, Mr. Lu.

144
00:07:30,599 --> 00:07:31,000
Zhixia...

145
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:31,960
Here, Maodou.

146
00:07:32,640 --> 00:07:33,279
Thank you.

147
00:07:33,599 --> 00:07:34,279
How is it?

148
00:07:35,080 --> 00:07:35,719
Maodou,

149
00:07:35,880 --> 00:07:38,000
let's toast Mr. Lu

150
00:07:38,440 --> 00:07:39,399
with his liquor,

151
00:07:39,479 --> 00:07:41,760
and borrow a bit of his brilliance.

152
00:07:41,919 --> 00:07:42,560
Cheers.

153
00:07:42,680 --> 00:07:43,520
You're too kind...

154
00:07:45,590 --> 00:07:46,382
Bottoms up.

155
00:07:54,359 --> 00:07:55,039
This liquor...

156
00:07:58,520 --> 00:08:00,640
It's mellow with a rich aftertaste.

157
00:08:01,399 --> 00:08:02,640
It goes down smoothly.

158
00:08:02,640 --> 00:08:03,604
This is good stuff.

159
00:08:04,520 --> 00:08:06,640
Zhixia, you know your liquor.

160
00:08:06,782 --> 00:08:07,910
That's a spot-on review.

161
00:08:07,919 --> 00:08:08,359
Really?

162
00:08:08,359 --> 00:08:09,159
Absolutely.

163
00:08:09,839 --> 00:08:10,960
Once the bottle was opened,

164
00:08:10,960 --> 00:08:12,560
the aroma filled the air.

165
00:08:13,279 --> 00:08:14,560
If I weren't pregnant,

166
00:08:14,560 --> 00:08:15,799
I'd definitely have another.

167
00:08:16,440 --> 00:08:17,719
There'll be plenty of chances.

168
00:08:19,537 --> 00:08:20,880
Then, I'll count on your help

169
00:08:21,520 --> 00:08:22,560
with the promotion.

170
00:08:23,120 --> 00:08:24,320
We won't disappoint you.

171
00:08:24,919 --> 00:08:25,560
Zhixia,

172
00:08:25,760 --> 00:08:27,919
I'm so impressed by you.

173
00:08:27,919 --> 00:08:30,389
Mr. Lu nearly forgot
his own name back there.

174
00:08:30,390 --> 00:08:32,648
He thought he was some kind
of liquor deity come to earth.

175
00:08:32,760 --> 00:08:34,399
That's what I call social experience.

176
00:08:35,279 --> 00:08:35,960
Maodou,

177
00:08:36,520 --> 00:08:38,479
you stick with me and learn well.

178
00:08:38,560 --> 00:08:40,760
Don't even think about job-hopping.

179
00:08:41,200 --> 00:08:42,519
In big companies,

180
00:08:42,519 --> 00:08:44,040
you're just a cog in the machine.

181
00:08:44,320 --> 00:08:45,320
Here,

182
00:08:45,800 --> 00:08:47,400
you could be my right hand.

183
00:08:48,119 --> 00:08:48,719
Zhixia.

184
00:08:49,280 --> 00:08:50,349
You're so capable.

185
00:08:50,350 --> 00:08:52,871
What's making you hesitate
about having a second child?

186
00:08:55,040 --> 00:08:56,359
If a better opportunity comes up,

187
00:08:56,839 --> 00:08:58,239
you should take it.

188
00:08:58,639 --> 00:08:59,440
Don't stay with me.

189
00:08:59,560 --> 00:09:00,359
Where are you going?

190
00:09:00,359 --> 00:09:01,599
Changhong Road.

191
00:09:01,599 --> 00:09:02,829
What for?

192
00:09:02,830 --> 00:09:05,515
To buy paper offerings. It's my maternal
grandmother's 49th-day memorial.

193
00:09:07,960 --> 00:09:08,599
Zhidong.

194
00:09:09,479 --> 00:09:10,200
Zhixia. Hao.

195
00:09:10,200 --> 00:09:11,760
What are you doing standing there?

196
00:09:12,759 --> 00:09:13,800
Waiting for you.

197
00:09:14,639 --> 00:09:16,160
Better not bring those things inside.

198
00:09:16,560 --> 00:09:17,239
Why not?

199
00:09:18,239 --> 00:09:19,560
Dad blames our grandmother

200
00:09:19,839 --> 00:09:20,920
for sending our sister away,

201
00:09:20,920 --> 00:09:22,737
so he's banned us
from visiting her grave.

202
00:09:23,440 --> 00:09:24,080
And then?

203
00:09:24,080 --> 00:09:25,160
Mom told me to talk to Uncle

204
00:09:25,160 --> 00:09:25,982
and the others.

205
00:09:25,990 --> 00:09:27,800
The group chat will go silent,
only private messages,

206
00:09:27,800 --> 00:09:29,004
and we'll meet separately.

207
00:09:29,599 --> 00:09:31,639
Is this a spy movie or something?

208
00:09:31,693 --> 00:09:32,750
Call it whatever you like,

209
00:09:32,750 --> 00:09:34,093
as long as it keeps the peace.

210
00:09:34,719 --> 00:09:36,479
Is all that really necessary? Relax.

211
00:09:36,479 --> 00:09:37,239
Dad.

212
00:09:37,400 --> 00:09:38,400
Zhang Hao, you're here.

213
00:09:38,400 --> 00:09:38,960
Dad.

214
00:09:38,960 --> 00:09:40,280
Come on. Get inside.

215
00:09:43,920 --> 00:09:45,119
Big brother?

216
00:09:45,839 --> 00:09:48,680
We'll head out tomorrow morning
at 7:30 AM sharp.

217
00:09:51,160 --> 00:09:52,040
When you leave,

218
00:09:52,040 --> 00:09:54,119
give us a heads-up.

219
00:09:54,200 --> 00:09:55,320
Oh, right.

220
00:09:55,320 --> 00:09:57,359
Don't say anything in the group chat.

221
00:09:57,359 --> 00:09:59,239
Just send me a message.

222
00:09:59,582 --> 00:10:00,470
If anything comes up,

223
00:10:00,479 --> 00:10:01,999
we'll talk privately.

224
00:10:02,759 --> 00:10:03,560
All right,

225
00:10:03,560 --> 00:10:04,719
so it's settled.

226
00:10:04,719 --> 00:10:06,469
Let's stick with that.

227
00:10:06,470 --> 00:10:08,337
- That's all.
- No need to pretend with us.

228
00:10:08,599 --> 00:10:10,080
You scared me.

229
00:10:10,080 --> 00:10:10,719
Mom.

230
00:10:12,315 --> 00:10:13,350
Zhang Hao, you're here.

231
00:10:13,359 --> 00:10:14,229
Mom.

232
00:10:14,230 --> 00:10:16,404
Who was the man
you were talking to on the phone?

233
00:10:16,560 --> 00:10:17,759
Oh, you...

234
00:10:17,839 --> 00:10:19,920
You never have a kind word, do you?

235
00:10:20,759 --> 00:10:21,359
It was...

236
00:10:22,280 --> 00:10:23,440
your uncle.

237
00:10:23,879 --> 00:10:26,680
We can't let your dad know about us

238
00:10:26,826 --> 00:10:28,080
visiting your grandma's grave.

239
00:10:28,080 --> 00:10:29,599
Otherwise, he'll blow up again.

240
00:10:30,560 --> 00:10:32,359
Even if we don't tell him,
he'll find out.

241
00:10:32,359 --> 00:10:34,160
The whole family's going out together.

242
00:10:34,800 --> 00:10:36,359
Tomorrow. He's going fishing.

243
00:10:36,599 --> 00:10:38,359
You know him. He leaves before dawn

244
00:10:38,479 --> 00:10:39,920
and doesn't come back till dark.

245
00:10:39,920 --> 00:10:41,960
And what if tomorrow he comes home early

246
00:10:41,960 --> 00:10:43,320
by chance?

247
00:10:43,893 --> 00:10:44,800
Here's what we'll do.

248
00:10:45,160 --> 00:10:47,080
Have Zhang Hao go fishing with him.

249
00:10:47,280 --> 00:10:48,920
That way, someone can cover for us.

250
00:10:49,759 --> 00:10:51,960
Do we really need
to make such a big deal out of this?

251
00:10:52,560 --> 00:10:54,839
I'll go check the situation first.

252
00:10:57,560 --> 00:10:58,879
Zhang Hao cracks me up.

253
00:10:59,239 --> 00:11:00,320
Xu Zhidong,

254
00:11:01,110 --> 00:11:02,671
you could learn something from him.

255
00:11:02,671 --> 00:11:03,320
A man

256
00:11:03,320 --> 00:11:05,440
should carry some authority.

257
00:11:05,440 --> 00:11:06,879
That's what makes women respect you.

258
00:11:07,200 --> 00:11:09,239
She might even be sneaking around
to make calls.

259
00:11:09,599 --> 00:11:10,599
Who says I'm scared?

260
00:11:10,599 --> 00:11:11,440
I'm not scared.

261
00:11:11,440 --> 00:11:13,759
Not at all.

262
00:11:13,759 --> 00:11:14,320
Why...

263
00:11:15,040 --> 00:11:16,359
Why should I be afraid

264
00:11:16,359 --> 00:11:17,719
to visit my own mother's grave?

265
00:11:17,719 --> 00:11:19,759
It's not even against the law, right?

266
00:11:19,759 --> 00:11:20,119
I...

267
00:11:20,119 --> 00:11:22,160
Then why are you whispering?

268
00:11:24,200 --> 00:11:25,320
I'm not... Fish!

269
00:11:25,320 --> 00:11:26,440
My fish.

270
00:11:26,440 --> 00:11:27,599
I need to check on my fish.

271
00:11:29,680 --> 00:11:30,239
Dad,

272
00:11:30,759 --> 00:11:33,239
I heard you're going fishing tomorrow?

273
00:11:33,239 --> 00:11:35,160
Yes, at the Chu River.

274
00:11:35,479 --> 00:11:36,920
Plenty of wild carp there.

275
00:11:37,239 --> 00:11:38,920
Jiao loves fish soup.

276
00:11:39,440 --> 00:11:40,239
I'll bring some back

277
00:11:40,239 --> 00:11:42,080
so your mother can make it for you guys.

278
00:11:42,800 --> 00:11:43,479
Thanks, Dad.

279
00:11:46,879 --> 00:11:49,239
You already know everything, don't you?

280
00:11:53,280 --> 00:11:53,999
Hao,

281
00:11:55,599 --> 00:11:57,680
do you really think I'd stop your mother

282
00:11:57,680 --> 00:11:59,440
from visiting the old lady's grave?

283
00:11:59,440 --> 00:12:00,639
True.

284
00:12:01,160 --> 00:12:02,920
I just talk big sometimes.

285
00:12:03,715 --> 00:12:05,110
When I was away those years,

286
00:12:05,119 --> 00:12:07,759
it was your grandmother
who raised the two of them.

287
00:12:08,440 --> 00:12:09,519
I did hate her,

288
00:12:10,200 --> 00:12:11,639
but I also owe her.

289
00:12:11,800 --> 00:12:12,320
Right?

290
00:12:13,280 --> 00:12:15,759
So you're just using fishing

291
00:12:15,999 --> 00:12:16,999
as an excuse

292
00:12:16,999 --> 00:12:19,359
to give them time
to visit her grave, huh?

293
00:12:19,839 --> 00:12:21,080
You talk too much.

294
00:12:21,680 --> 00:12:22,280
Move aside.

295
00:12:22,519 --> 00:12:23,080
Okay.

296
00:12:24,239 --> 00:12:26,040
Dinner time. Put your phone down.

297
00:12:26,040 --> 00:12:26,639
Zhidong!

298
00:12:26,719 --> 00:12:27,200
Zhidong!

299
00:12:27,200 --> 00:12:28,560
Quick! Help me with this.

300
00:12:29,040 --> 00:12:29,440
Hold that.

301
00:12:29,440 --> 00:12:32,440
The fried fish is
a little overdone today.

302
00:12:32,879 --> 00:12:33,560
No,

303
00:12:33,560 --> 00:12:35,040
it's perfect.

304
00:12:35,160 --> 00:12:36,470
You haven't even tasted it yet.

305
00:12:36,479 --> 00:12:37,519
Flatterer.

306
00:12:37,519 --> 00:12:38,560
It smells perfect already.

307
00:12:39,440 --> 00:12:40,800
Mom, tomorrow...

308
00:12:48,400 --> 00:12:51,400
Can you make
stir-fried turnip greens tomorrow?

309
00:12:52,119 --> 00:12:53,589
Finish what's in your bowl

310
00:12:53,590 --> 00:12:55,204
before talking about tomorrow's meal.

311
00:12:56,759 --> 00:12:57,400
Zhang Hao,

312
00:12:58,320 --> 00:13:00,519
did anyone reply
to that missing-person post

313
00:13:00,719 --> 00:13:01,719
you made online?

314
00:13:03,320 --> 00:13:04,639
A few did,

315
00:13:04,879 --> 00:13:06,400
but I checked them all.

316
00:13:06,639 --> 00:13:07,519
None matched.

317
00:13:09,879 --> 00:13:10,680
Well...

318
00:13:11,560 --> 00:13:13,400
They've already demolished
the town hospital.

319
00:13:13,400 --> 00:13:16,119
That makes the search even harder.

320
00:13:16,119 --> 00:13:16,759
Mom.

321
00:13:17,359 --> 00:13:18,879
We can't rush this.

322
00:13:19,048 --> 00:13:19,871
Think about it.

323
00:13:19,880 --> 00:13:22,270
It's been nearly thirty years
since our sister was sent away.

324
00:13:22,271 --> 00:13:23,439
It can't be easy to find her.

325
00:13:23,440 --> 00:13:24,160
Unless...

326
00:13:24,400 --> 00:13:25,680
Unless what?

327
00:13:25,680 --> 00:13:27,582
Unless our family
was rich or influential.

328
00:13:28,680 --> 00:13:29,359
Listen to him...

329
00:13:29,359 --> 00:13:31,440
Should've sent him away back then.

330
00:13:32,160 --> 00:13:33,400
All right, enough.

331
00:13:33,400 --> 00:13:33,960
Dad.

332
00:13:34,440 --> 00:13:36,160
How about I have a drink with you?

333
00:13:36,999 --> 00:13:37,680
You see?

334
00:13:37,693 --> 00:13:38,470
- No drinking.
- I'll get the liquor.

335
00:13:38,479 --> 00:13:39,280
You're driving later.

336
00:13:39,280 --> 00:13:39,960
Right.

337
00:13:39,960 --> 00:13:40,599
You drive, then.

338
00:13:40,599 --> 00:13:41,200
No...

339
00:13:47,680 --> 00:13:48,759
(Couple's watches.)

340
00:13:49,004 --> 00:13:49,870
(What do you think?)

341
00:13:49,871 --> 00:13:51,200
(The second hands move in sync.)

342
00:13:51,204 --> 00:13:53,180
(Every minute, every second,
I'm in step with you.)

343
00:13:53,182 --> 00:13:54,471
(Every minute, every second,)

344
00:13:54,960 --> 00:13:55,719
(I love you.)

345
00:14:00,119 --> 00:14:00,719
Come in.

346
00:14:02,400 --> 00:14:03,040
Mom.

347
00:14:06,800 --> 00:14:07,359
Here you go.

348
00:14:10,519 --> 00:14:11,440
I warmed up some milk.

349
00:14:11,800 --> 00:14:12,359
Okay.

350
00:14:16,080 --> 00:14:17,182
It's not too hot, right?

351
00:14:18,719 --> 00:14:19,320
Not hot.

352
00:14:22,382 --> 00:14:23,915
Mom, you should go to bed now.

353
00:14:23,915 --> 00:14:24,804
It's so late.

354
00:14:24,848 --> 00:14:25,870
Anyway, I can't sleep.

355
00:14:27,400 --> 00:14:29,080
Seeing you makes me feel more at ease.

356
00:14:33,680 --> 00:14:35,519
Did I ever tell you?

357
00:14:35,519 --> 00:14:36,680
It was Xiaoni's Mom.

358
00:14:37,599 --> 00:14:40,400
When she was pregnant with Xiaoni,
she had a cornual pregnancy,

359
00:14:41,839 --> 00:14:42,800
but it turned out fine.

360
00:14:42,839 --> 00:14:43,839
It healed on its own.

361
00:14:43,839 --> 00:14:45,479
Look how smart Xiaoni is now.

362
00:14:46,040 --> 00:14:47,519
It's actually fine.

363
00:14:48,080 --> 00:14:49,080
We don't need to worry.

364
00:14:52,080 --> 00:14:52,879
Drink a bit more.

365
00:15:03,599 --> 00:15:04,200
Zhixia.

366
00:15:04,800 --> 00:15:06,040
This electric car is very good.

367
00:15:06,040 --> 00:15:06,920
It's really fast.

368
00:15:07,519 --> 00:15:08,560
Just enjoy it,

369
00:15:08,560 --> 00:15:09,560
but pedal slowly.

370
00:15:09,879 --> 00:15:11,119
It uses up a lot of battery.

371
00:15:11,200 --> 00:15:12,515
Then don't let me drive it back.

372
00:15:12,999 --> 00:15:14,119
Mom, don't rush.

373
00:15:14,400 --> 00:15:15,639
Send a message to Uncle.

374
00:15:15,639 --> 00:15:17,320
Tell him we're almost there.

375
00:15:17,320 --> 00:15:18,080
I already told him.

376
00:15:18,080 --> 00:15:20,620
I messaged him as soon as I came out,
saying we're almost there.

377
00:15:20,879 --> 00:15:22,239
Mom, you're really a pro driver.

378
00:15:22,759 --> 00:15:23,519
What?

379
00:15:23,519 --> 00:15:24,119
Nothing.

380
00:15:24,879 --> 00:15:26,239
What's wrong? We're almost there.

381
00:15:28,359 --> 00:15:28,960
By the way...

382
00:15:30,320 --> 00:15:31,160
Zhixia.

383
00:15:31,639 --> 00:15:34,080
Pregnant women are more susceptible
to attracting bad things.

384
00:15:36,320 --> 00:15:37,160
The old ring.

385
00:15:37,479 --> 00:15:38,719
The old ring, pure gold.

386
00:15:38,719 --> 00:15:39,719
Put it on.

387
00:15:42,479 --> 00:15:43,639
Why's it so loose?

388
00:15:44,080 --> 00:15:45,479
If you throw it again...

389
00:15:45,999 --> 00:15:46,800
I'll put it here.

390
00:15:47,440 --> 00:15:48,599
It can ward off evil.

391
00:15:49,040 --> 00:15:50,639
It wards off evil. It's got that power.

392
00:15:52,280 --> 00:15:55,589
I've worked hard for
the Xu family all these years,

393
00:15:55,590 --> 00:15:57,204
caring for the elders and children.

394
00:15:58,320 --> 00:15:59,839
Zhang Hao, did you see?

395
00:16:00,080 --> 00:16:02,680
Madam Yu finally has a conscience.

396
00:16:03,479 --> 00:16:04,759
Look, Xu Zhidong.

397
00:16:05,119 --> 00:16:06,200
Xu Zhidong.

398
00:16:06,280 --> 00:16:08,080
This ring is actually not too big.

399
00:16:09,280 --> 00:16:10,119
Do you like it?

400
00:16:10,920 --> 00:16:11,719
Of course I like it.

401
00:16:11,719 --> 00:16:12,920
Who doesn't like gold?

402
00:16:12,920 --> 00:16:13,759
Thanks, Mom.

403
00:16:13,759 --> 00:16:15,920
Wear it for a few more days
and then return it to me.

404
00:16:16,479 --> 00:16:17,239
You're something.

405
00:16:18,119 --> 00:16:19,160
What are you laughing at?

406
00:16:19,160 --> 00:16:21,119
This was passed down to me
by your grandmother.

407
00:16:21,471 --> 00:16:23,510
She said it's passed down to men,
not women.

408
00:16:23,879 --> 00:16:25,200
Zhixia, don't worry.

409
00:16:25,759 --> 00:16:27,239
Later, Mom will pass it to me.

410
00:16:27,239 --> 00:16:28,560
Then I'll give it to you.

411
00:16:28,839 --> 00:16:30,119
Would Bichen be happy to do it?

412
00:16:30,320 --> 00:16:32,800
For big matters like this,
she listens to me.

413
00:16:33,320 --> 00:16:33,960
Right?

414
00:16:34,800 --> 00:16:37,160
Xu Zhidong, you'd better remember this.

415
00:16:37,160 --> 00:16:37,999
Alright, stop joking.

416
00:16:37,999 --> 00:16:39,960
Hurry up. We're almost there. Go ahead.

417
00:16:39,960 --> 00:16:41,280
Right, turn right!

418
00:16:41,280 --> 00:16:42,560
Right, just park there.

419
00:16:42,570 --> 00:16:44,160
Your uncle and the rest
are already here.

420
00:16:44,160 --> 00:16:44,960
Hurry up.

421
00:16:45,160 --> 00:16:46,119
We're late.

422
00:16:46,119 --> 00:16:47,160
Hurry up.

423
00:16:47,440 --> 00:16:49,320
Everyone's here already.

424
00:16:49,320 --> 00:16:49,839
Park quickly.

425
00:16:49,839 --> 00:16:50,639
Alright, slow down.

426
00:16:50,639 --> 00:16:51,400
Don't hesitate.

427
00:16:51,400 --> 00:16:51,999
Zhidong.

428
00:16:51,999 --> 00:16:52,879
Quickly open the trunk.

429
00:16:52,879 --> 00:16:54,800
It's not like we're going to work.

430
00:16:55,040 --> 00:16:56,160
Do we need to clock in?

431
00:16:56,719 --> 00:16:57,479
Nonsense!

432
00:16:57,680 --> 00:16:58,879
Can your grandmother wait?

433
00:16:58,879 --> 00:16:59,800
Hurry up.

434
00:16:59,800 --> 00:17:00,759
What's this?

435
00:17:01,359 --> 00:17:02,879
Fried fish for your grandmother.

436
00:17:02,960 --> 00:17:04,359
We're here, everyone.

437
00:17:04,359 --> 00:17:05,040
Hurry up.

438
00:17:05,040 --> 00:17:06,519
Alright, slow down. Don't rush.

439
00:17:06,519 --> 00:17:08,200
Mom, don't worry, okay?

440
00:17:08,200 --> 00:17:08,759
Slow down.

441
00:17:08,759 --> 00:17:09,759
The road ahead is rough.

442
00:17:10,479 --> 00:17:11,200
Brother!

443
00:17:11,800 --> 00:17:12,879
- Sister!
- Finally here.

444
00:17:13,040 --> 00:17:14,400
- Alright.
- Don't rush.

445
00:17:14,400 --> 00:17:15,559
Slow down.

446
00:17:15,559 --> 00:17:17,239
Slow down. We're not late.

447
00:17:17,319 --> 00:17:18,840
- I'm not late.
- Second Aunt.

448
00:17:19,640 --> 00:17:20,519
Slow down.

449
00:17:20,519 --> 00:17:21,039
Alright.

450
00:17:21,600 --> 00:17:21,920
Aunt.

451
00:17:21,920 --> 00:17:23,239
Sister.

452
00:17:23,239 --> 00:17:24,600
You guys are so early.

453
00:17:27,239 --> 00:17:27,840
Alright.

454
00:17:28,039 --> 00:17:29,640
Jingxiang, you...

455
00:17:29,640 --> 00:17:30,120
Mom.

456
00:17:30,120 --> 00:17:31,680
Jingyun and I already set it up.

457
00:17:31,680 --> 00:17:33,640
You just came and placed it
in the middle.

458
00:17:33,640 --> 00:17:34,319
That's right.

459
00:17:34,319 --> 00:17:36,759
Mom loves the fried fish
I made the most.

460
00:17:36,759 --> 00:17:37,600
Right, Mom?

461
00:17:37,600 --> 00:17:38,400
Nonsense.

462
00:17:38,759 --> 00:17:41,360
Mom loves the braised bream
I made the most.

463
00:17:41,360 --> 00:17:42,999
Look, two fish.

464
00:17:42,999 --> 00:17:45,559
Alright.
You should've bought a bigger one.

465
00:17:45,559 --> 00:17:46,640
You bought such a small one.

466
00:17:46,880 --> 00:17:48,200
Even the cat won't be full.

467
00:17:48,200 --> 00:17:49,440
- Do you understand?
- True.

468
00:17:49,920 --> 00:17:51,680
We need to eat small fish.

469
00:17:51,680 --> 00:17:52,920
The small ones have more flavor.

470
00:17:53,160 --> 00:17:54,880
Our sister is right.

471
00:17:54,880 --> 00:17:56,880
You're just petty.

472
00:17:56,999 --> 00:17:59,799
Honestly, look at how wide
my fried fish is.

473
00:17:59,799 --> 00:18:00,239
Right?

474
00:18:00,239 --> 00:18:02,039
We've all eaten the small ones.

475
00:18:02,160 --> 00:18:03,999
As for our cooking skills,

476
00:18:03,999 --> 00:18:05,279
let's have Mom judge.

477
00:18:05,279 --> 00:18:05,920
Mom.

478
00:18:06,079 --> 00:18:07,840
Which one of us three is the best cook?

479
00:18:08,160 --> 00:18:08,799
Mom.

480
00:18:08,880 --> 00:18:10,279
If Grandma really came out to judge,

481
00:18:10,279 --> 00:18:11,640
we'd all be scared.

482
00:18:11,920 --> 00:18:12,600
Alright.

483
00:18:12,600 --> 00:18:13,880
If you keep arguing,

484
00:18:14,160 --> 00:18:15,680
you'll wake Mom up.

485
00:18:15,680 --> 00:18:16,400
Come.

486
00:18:16,400 --> 00:18:17,360
Come, everyone, stand up.

487
00:18:17,360 --> 00:18:18,079
Come.

488
00:18:18,319 --> 00:18:19,400
Good, thank you.

489
00:18:20,680 --> 00:18:21,600
This is the taste.

490
00:18:22,319 --> 00:18:23,680
Come, try it.

491
00:18:23,680 --> 00:18:24,999
This is their signature dish.

492
00:18:33,960 --> 00:18:34,400
Mom.

493
00:18:34,400 --> 00:18:35,400
You leave it. I'll wash.

494
00:18:35,400 --> 00:18:35,999
No.

495
00:18:35,999 --> 00:18:36,999
- Why did you get up?
- I'll wash.

496
00:18:36,999 --> 00:18:37,680
Don't do it.

497
00:18:37,840 --> 00:18:40,600
Didn't the doctor tell you to stay
in bed?

498
00:18:40,600 --> 00:18:42,120
I'm tired of lying. It's fine.

499
00:18:42,120 --> 00:18:42,759
Go ahead.

500
00:18:42,759 --> 00:18:43,840
You don't need to.

501
00:18:43,840 --> 00:18:45,840
No, change your position.

502
00:18:45,840 --> 00:18:46,759
You can't get up.

503
00:18:46,759 --> 00:18:47,759
I'm tired, Mom.

504
00:18:47,759 --> 00:18:49,079
It's fine. I'm helping out.

505
00:18:49,079 --> 00:18:49,640
No.

506
00:18:50,279 --> 00:18:52,400
If you want something, just call us.

507
00:18:53,759 --> 00:18:54,440
Mom.

508
00:18:55,079 --> 00:18:55,759
Slow down.

509
00:18:55,999 --> 00:18:57,160
Give, bow to Grandma.

510
00:18:59,840 --> 00:19:00,479
Mom.

511
00:19:00,799 --> 00:19:03,079
Please bless our family.

512
00:19:03,719 --> 00:19:06,200
May we be free from illness
and disaster.

513
00:19:06,640 --> 00:19:09,279
We don't ask for great wealth,

514
00:19:09,519 --> 00:19:10,999
nor do we ask for riches.

515
00:19:11,120 --> 00:19:13,519
We only ask for peace.

516
00:19:13,519 --> 00:19:14,160
Mom.

517
00:19:16,519 --> 00:19:18,999
Second Aunt didn't even ask
for my opinion.

518
00:19:19,239 --> 00:19:20,120
I just want to be rich.

519
00:19:20,120 --> 00:19:20,999
I just want wealth.

520
00:19:20,999 --> 00:19:22,519
Later, tell Grandma.

521
00:19:24,200 --> 00:19:25,120
Mom, Mom.

522
00:19:25,759 --> 00:19:26,360
Mom.

523
00:19:26,360 --> 00:19:27,559
Mom, slow down.

524
00:19:28,559 --> 00:19:29,319
Mom.

525
00:19:29,360 --> 00:19:29,799
Mom.

526
00:19:30,440 --> 00:19:31,519
Mom, slow down.

527
00:19:31,999 --> 00:19:32,640
Mom.

528
00:19:33,160 --> 00:19:33,759
Mom.

529
00:19:34,079 --> 00:19:36,239
Zhilu still hasn't been found.

530
00:19:36,239 --> 00:19:38,680
I'm almost dying, Mom.

531
00:19:39,400 --> 00:19:39,999
Mom.

532
00:19:39,999 --> 00:19:42,360
It was Grandma who sent the girl away.

533
00:19:42,960 --> 00:19:43,600
Mom.

534
00:19:43,999 --> 00:19:46,479
We've posted on newspapers

535
00:19:46,479 --> 00:19:48,279
and online,

536
00:19:48,519 --> 00:19:50,640
but we still can't find her.

537
00:19:51,120 --> 00:19:52,920
Do you also have her

538
00:19:52,920 --> 00:19:55,160
in your heart?

539
00:19:55,360 --> 00:19:56,759
Mom, please

540
00:19:56,880 --> 00:19:59,960
guide us to the right path.

541
00:19:59,960 --> 00:20:03,239
Mom, please.

542
00:20:06,160 --> 00:20:08,719
Zhilu was sent by you.

543
00:20:08,719 --> 00:20:11,759
You must take responsibility, Mom.

544
00:20:12,680 --> 00:20:14,160
By the way, Mom.

545
00:20:14,519 --> 00:20:16,400
There's a master in Longhu Alley

546
00:20:16,640 --> 00:20:19,440
who can walk between the realms.

547
00:20:19,440 --> 00:20:20,719
They say he's especially amazing.

548
00:20:20,999 --> 00:20:22,799
I want him to find you, Mom.

549
00:20:22,880 --> 00:20:24,079
To ask you...

550
00:20:24,079 --> 00:20:27,759
Where did you send Zhilu to?

551
00:20:27,880 --> 00:20:30,999
I'm just giving you a heads up, Mom.

552
00:20:30,999 --> 00:20:32,920
If anyone asks you about this,

553
00:20:32,999 --> 00:20:35,279
please don't be shocked.

554
00:20:35,279 --> 00:20:37,160
Don't be scared, Mom.

555
00:20:37,160 --> 00:20:37,880
Jingxiang,

556
00:20:38,160 --> 00:20:40,893
is the person you're talking about
called Zhang Dongmao?

557
00:20:41,440 --> 00:20:42,239
Yes.

558
00:20:42,960 --> 00:20:45,200
He's a scammer. He got arrested.

559
00:20:47,360 --> 00:20:48,519
Really. I'm not lying.

560
00:20:48,519 --> 00:20:49,640
He got arrested?

561
00:20:50,440 --> 00:20:51,239
Mom.

562
00:20:51,400 --> 00:20:52,680
He got arrested.

563
00:20:53,079 --> 00:20:55,600
Where can I find Zhilu?

564
00:20:55,600 --> 00:20:56,479
Mom, it's okay.

565
00:20:56,479 --> 00:20:57,440
I'm here.

566
00:20:57,440 --> 00:20:58,120
Get up.

567
00:20:58,120 --> 00:20:59,160
I'll go find my sister.

568
00:20:59,160 --> 00:21:00,880
I'll go find her.

569
00:21:02,239 --> 00:21:02,880
Mrs. Feng.

570
00:21:02,999 --> 00:21:03,680
Where's Mingzhu?

571
00:21:03,960 --> 00:21:04,719
Upstairs.

572
00:21:04,759 --> 00:21:05,360
Okay.

573
00:21:09,893 --> 00:21:11,440
(We want to interview the hero's wife.)

574
00:21:11,759 --> 00:21:13,799
This was taken of me in the hospital
the other day.

575
00:21:14,239 --> 00:21:15,880
It has over 100,000 views.

576
00:21:16,519 --> 00:21:17,920
This is an invasion of privacy!

577
00:21:18,060 --> 00:21:18,920
How could this happen?

578
00:21:18,920 --> 00:21:19,715
(Now you're a parent too.)

579
00:21:19,715 --> 00:21:20,960
(How do you feel about
your parents abandoning you?)

580
00:21:20,960 --> 00:21:22,920
Come on, I'll help you file a complaint.

581
00:21:23,239 --> 00:21:25,360
These marketing accounts
are really too much.

582
00:21:28,079 --> 00:21:29,079
Zhilu.

583
00:21:31,200 --> 00:21:31,999
Zhilu.

584
00:21:33,079 --> 00:21:35,120
Where can I find Zhilu?

585
00:21:36,160 --> 00:21:38,640
You said they took the child away
as soon as she was born.

586
00:21:39,880 --> 00:21:41,999
I never saw the child.

587
00:21:42,640 --> 00:21:45,680
I never even touched her.

588
00:21:45,893 --> 00:21:46,600
(I want to ask...)

589
00:21:46,600 --> 00:21:48,079
She was just taken away.

590
00:21:48,680 --> 00:21:49,840
After all these years...

591
00:21:49,840 --> 00:21:51,319
(What do you think about it?)

592
00:21:51,319 --> 00:21:52,160
(Call security.)

593
00:21:52,719 --> 00:21:54,559
Isn't this a coincidence?

594
00:21:55,239 --> 00:21:55,999
Look.

595
00:21:56,120 --> 00:21:57,799
This girl was also adopted.

596
00:21:58,239 --> 00:22:00,239
Look, her age is about the same.

597
00:22:07,160 --> 00:22:07,799
Wait...

598
00:22:08,319 --> 00:22:08,999
Son.

599
00:22:09,239 --> 00:22:09,999
Son, come here.

600
00:22:09,999 --> 00:22:11,960
Come, turn your face this way.

601
00:22:14,320 --> 00:22:15,320
This...

602
00:22:16,360 --> 00:22:17,582
Let me see.

603
00:22:17,582 --> 00:22:18,750
Let me see her information.

604
00:22:18,759 --> 00:22:19,519
Mom.

605
00:22:19,680 --> 00:22:20,840
I want to see her.

606
00:22:20,840 --> 00:22:21,920
Quick, get her.

607
00:22:21,920 --> 00:22:22,680
Let me see her.

608
00:22:22,680 --> 00:22:23,999
That one.

609
00:22:24,640 --> 00:22:25,319
Quick.

610
00:22:26,079 --> 00:22:26,999
Here, found her.

611
00:22:26,999 --> 00:22:28,200
Right.

612
00:22:28,200 --> 00:22:29,900
(March 26th, Happy Birthday to me)

613
00:22:32,680 --> 00:22:33,999
This is too much of a coincidence.

614
00:22:36,239 --> 00:22:38,239
She was also born on March 26th.

615
00:22:44,759 --> 00:22:48,039
(Happy Birthday to you.)

616
00:22:48,400 --> 00:22:51,999
(Happy Birthday to you.)

617
00:22:52,640 --> 00:22:53,880
Mom has shown her spirit!

618
00:22:55,804 --> 00:22:57,026
Mom has shown her spirit!

619
00:22:57,026 --> 00:22:58,070
She has shown her spirit!

620
00:22:58,759 --> 00:23:00,239
Mom has shown her spirit!

621
00:23:01,400 --> 00:23:02,840
Mom has shown her spirit!

622
00:23:03,079 --> 00:23:04,549
(Shen Mingzhu, is the child healthy?)

623
00:23:04,550 --> 00:23:06,550
(Do you have any difficulties
or pressures right now?)

624
00:23:06,559 --> 00:23:07,440
(No. Don't pull me.)

625
00:23:07,440 --> 00:23:08,799
(We're doing a serious interview.)

626
00:23:08,799 --> 00:23:09,920
(I want to ask...)

627
00:23:14,039 --> 00:23:15,559
(Shen Mingzhu, is the child healthy?)

628
00:23:15,560 --> 00:23:17,630
(Do you have any difficulties
or pressures right now?)

629
00:23:17,640 --> 00:23:18,479
(No. Don't pull me!)

630
00:23:18,479 --> 00:23:19,840
(We're doing a serious interview.)

631
00:23:19,840 --> 00:23:20,920
(I want to ask...)

632
00:23:21,079 --> 00:23:22,319
(Now you are a parent too.)

633
00:23:22,319 --> 00:23:23,680
(How do you feel about your parents)

634
00:23:23,680 --> 00:23:25,279
(abandoning you?)

635
00:23:25,279 --> 00:23:26,079
(Call security.)

636
00:23:26,079 --> 00:23:26,960
(Do an interview.)

637
00:23:27,999 --> 00:23:28,799
(Don't touch me!)

638
00:23:28,799 --> 00:23:30,180
♪A long letter written♪

639
00:23:30,660 --> 00:23:34,060
♪Letting love gently expand♪

640
00:23:35,200 --> 00:23:36,559
What is this?

641
00:23:36,559 --> 00:23:38,160
What's going on?

642
00:23:38,180 --> 00:23:39,039
(Doing an interview.)

643
00:23:39,200 --> 00:23:41,519
(The doctor hit someone!)

644
00:23:42,440 --> 00:23:43,239
(Don't touch me!)

645
00:23:59,471 --> 00:24:00,600
(Shen Family Restaurant)
Go ahead, tell me.

646
00:24:00,600 --> 00:24:01,559
What were you thinking?

647
00:24:01,840 --> 00:24:03,039
Feng Jianqi is a hero.

648
00:24:03,115 --> 00:24:03,640
Stop filming.

649
00:24:03,640 --> 00:24:04,999
He is the bloodline of heroes.

650
00:24:05,960 --> 00:24:07,759
Stop filming!

651
00:24:08,279 --> 00:24:09,440
He is the posthumous son.

652
00:24:10,920 --> 00:24:11,840
He just passed away.

653
00:24:11,840 --> 00:24:13,248
And now you don't want this child?

654
00:24:13,319 --> 00:24:15,029
What is this? This is too much.

655
00:24:15,030 --> 00:24:16,760
Shen Mingzhu,
what are you really thinking?

656
00:24:16,782 --> 00:24:17,600
Stop filming!

657
00:24:17,880 --> 00:24:18,719
Stop filming.

658
00:24:19,400 --> 00:24:19,999
Move away.

659
00:24:20,840 --> 00:24:22,709
Stop filming! What do you want?

660
00:24:22,710 --> 00:24:23,537
Everyone, get up!

661
00:24:25,048 --> 00:24:25,550
Get lost.

662
00:24:26,160 --> 00:24:26,759
I'll kill you!

663
00:24:28,279 --> 00:24:29,559
You're still hitting me?

664
00:24:30,600 --> 00:24:32,600
Is this still the family of a hero?

665
00:24:33,759 --> 00:24:34,519
Don't hit me!

666
00:24:35,799 --> 00:24:36,440
Give it to me!

667
00:24:37,079 --> 00:24:38,999
Dad!

668
00:24:39,239 --> 00:24:40,120
- Dad, move!
- Go!

669
00:24:40,239 --> 00:24:41,039
Go, you go.

670
00:24:41,039 --> 00:24:42,600
Get lost! Everyone, get lost!

671
00:24:42,604 --> 00:24:44,230
If you come again,
I'll pour water on you.

672
00:24:44,230 --> 00:24:45,404
What kind of manners is this?

673
00:24:45,426 --> 00:24:47,070
Stop filming!

674
00:24:47,319 --> 00:24:48,120
Go away!

675
00:24:48,479 --> 00:24:50,640
Stop filming! Everyone, get lost!

676
00:24:50,880 --> 00:24:51,519
Get lost!

677
00:24:51,920 --> 00:24:52,999
Who lacks manners now?

678
00:24:52,999 --> 00:24:54,799
If you dare come and film again, try me!

679
00:24:55,239 --> 00:24:56,719
Don't let me see you again!

680
00:24:57,160 --> 00:24:58,840
- Get lost! Go away!
- This is too much!

681
00:24:58,840 --> 00:25:01,093
- Stop filming!
- You can't bully people like this.

682
00:25:01,120 --> 00:25:02,600
You've brought this to my doorstep.

683
00:25:03,200 --> 00:25:04,079
It's okay.

684
00:25:04,719 --> 00:25:06,079
Your brother can handle it there.

685
00:25:06,600 --> 00:25:07,400
It'll be fine soon.

686
00:25:08,137 --> 00:25:09,070
Sit down for a while.

687
00:25:13,840 --> 00:25:14,440
Hey.

688
00:25:15,400 --> 00:25:17,279
Feng and his wife are here.

689
00:25:17,880 --> 00:25:18,440
Mingzhu.

690
00:25:18,440 --> 00:25:19,279
Quick, come in.

691
00:25:19,279 --> 00:25:20,200
Are you okay?

692
00:25:20,440 --> 00:25:21,559
Why are you guys here?

693
00:25:22,960 --> 00:25:23,799
It's like this.

694
00:25:23,880 --> 00:25:25,400
We saw the video.

695
00:25:25,470 --> 00:25:27,648
Feng said something
was definitely going to happen,

696
00:25:27,671 --> 00:25:28,648
so we hurried over.

697
00:25:28,719 --> 00:25:31,360
We didn't expect it to turn out
like this.

698
00:25:31,360 --> 00:25:32,120
Exactly.

699
00:25:32,120 --> 00:25:33,239
You know, online bullying

700
00:25:33,239 --> 00:25:34,319
is terrifying.

701
00:25:34,319 --> 00:25:36,759
My daughter's already
been through a lot.

702
00:25:36,759 --> 00:25:37,400
You know.

703
00:25:37,519 --> 00:25:38,640
In-laws.

704
00:25:38,840 --> 00:25:40,120
Let's not talk too much.

705
00:25:41,070 --> 00:25:41,915
Here is the thing.

706
00:25:42,279 --> 00:25:44,880
We want to bring Mingzhu home
to stay for a few days.

707
00:25:46,200 --> 00:25:47,360
This online bullying

708
00:25:47,360 --> 00:25:48,680
comes fast and goes fast.

709
00:25:49,279 --> 00:25:50,079
Calm down.

710
00:25:50,079 --> 00:25:51,319
It'll be fine in a few days.

711
00:25:51,840 --> 00:25:55,200
What did you say you were going
to do? I didn't hear clearly.

712
00:25:55,600 --> 00:25:56,239
Well.

713
00:25:56,759 --> 00:25:59,880
We want to bring Mingzhu home
to stay for a few days.

714
00:26:00,479 --> 00:26:01,519
To your place?

715
00:26:03,360 --> 00:26:04,200
Is that okay?

716
00:26:05,279 --> 00:26:06,440
Mingzhu, what do you think?

717
00:26:10,600 --> 00:26:11,319
Alright.

718
00:26:11,559 --> 00:26:12,120
Okay.

719
00:26:12,120 --> 00:26:12,960
Then...

720
00:26:13,279 --> 00:26:15,799
Stay for two days, and then come back.

721
00:26:15,799 --> 00:26:16,479
Okay.

722
00:26:16,759 --> 00:26:17,960
Then, um...

723
00:26:17,960 --> 00:26:19,160
Let's go the back way.

724
00:26:19,400 --> 00:26:20,479
- Okay.
- OK.

725
00:26:21,319 --> 00:26:21,920
Quick.

726
00:26:24,804 --> 00:26:27,026
I've been talking to you,
and you weren't listening.

727
00:26:27,026 --> 00:26:28,120
It worked.

728
00:26:28,840 --> 00:26:29,519
Yeah.

729
00:26:29,890 --> 00:26:32,448
My parents were so excited
that they didn't sleep all night.

730
00:26:32,680 --> 00:26:33,960
The two of them

731
00:26:34,039 --> 00:26:35,799
were almost at each other's throats.

732
00:26:35,920 --> 00:26:38,160
But overnight, they formed
a united front.

733
00:26:38,239 --> 00:26:39,840
They both agreed that Shen Mingzhu

734
00:26:39,840 --> 00:26:42,079
is the little girl we sent away.

735
00:26:42,440 --> 00:26:43,200
Then?

736
00:26:43,640 --> 00:26:45,640
Then they sent me with Xu Zhidong

737
00:26:45,640 --> 00:26:46,559
to find her.

738
00:26:46,960 --> 00:26:48,160
You know that, right?

739
00:26:48,360 --> 00:26:49,600
Sending me with Xu Zhidong

740
00:26:49,600 --> 00:26:51,799
is basically sending me alone.

741
00:26:52,160 --> 00:26:53,680
I'm here with you too.

742
00:26:55,120 --> 00:26:57,519
Didn't you say I'm a part of your life?

743
00:26:58,880 --> 00:26:59,920
Yes, I said that.

744
00:27:01,880 --> 00:27:02,640
Besides,

745
00:27:02,640 --> 00:27:04,840
Xu Zhidong might not even want
to find her.

746
00:27:05,160 --> 00:27:05,999
Think about it.

747
00:27:06,160 --> 00:27:07,719
He's the youngest in the Xu family.

748
00:27:07,920 --> 00:27:08,840
Since childhood,

749
00:27:08,840 --> 00:27:11,120
all the good stuff at home goes
to him first.

750
00:27:11,360 --> 00:27:13,759
Now suddenly, an older sister drops
from the sky.

751
00:27:14,239 --> 00:27:16,120
Well, he's going to lose favor.

752
00:27:17,759 --> 00:27:18,680
Zhang Hao.

753
00:27:19,039 --> 00:27:20,400
Adults still fight for favor?

754
00:27:20,840 --> 00:27:22,719
I've noticed you get sleepy
really easily.

755
00:27:22,759 --> 00:27:24,559
Do you want to go to the hospital
to check?

756
00:27:24,559 --> 00:27:25,319
Check what?

757
00:27:25,440 --> 00:27:26,640
Your blood might be thick.

758
00:27:26,640 --> 00:27:27,759
I'm worried.

759
00:27:29,920 --> 00:27:30,719
Quick, it's okay.

760
00:27:30,719 --> 00:27:31,719
Quick, come.

761
00:27:31,920 --> 00:27:33,039
This way.

762
00:27:36,799 --> 00:27:37,440
Mingzhu.

763
00:27:38,160 --> 00:27:40,039
Call us anytime if there's anything.

764
00:27:40,200 --> 00:27:42,160
If you want anything to eat, just say.

765
00:27:42,160 --> 00:27:43,382
Your dad will bring it over.

766
00:27:43,404 --> 00:27:44,510
I will cook for you.

767
00:27:44,582 --> 00:27:46,782
If you're uncomfortable staying here,
just tell us.

768
00:27:46,999 --> 00:27:48,239
Don't worry.

769
00:27:48,239 --> 00:27:49,640
We'll take good care of her.

770
00:27:49,640 --> 00:27:51,200
Don't worry.

771
00:27:51,200 --> 00:27:51,740
Quick.

772
00:27:51,740 --> 00:27:52,479
I'm leaving.

773
00:27:53,440 --> 00:27:54,239
Go ahead.

774
00:27:55,319 --> 00:27:55,960
Come on.

775
00:27:57,920 --> 00:27:58,719
Drive slowly.

776
00:28:14,799 --> 00:28:15,759
Hello, everyone.

777
00:28:15,759 --> 00:28:17,239
Right now, we are at

778
00:28:17,239 --> 00:28:18,519
the door of Shen Mingzhu's house.

779
00:28:19,279 --> 00:28:20,559
She hasn't come out yet.

780
00:28:20,559 --> 00:28:21,680
We'll wait here.

781
00:28:22,440 --> 00:28:23,400
Wait a moment, everyone.

782
00:28:24,848 --> 00:28:26,640
Hello, is this Shen Family Restaurant?

783
00:28:26,782 --> 00:28:27,804
Yes, it's right there.

784
00:28:27,920 --> 00:28:28,360
Right here.

785
00:28:32,559 --> 00:28:33,319
Is anyone here?

786
00:28:33,799 --> 00:28:34,799
Excuse me?

787
00:28:36,160 --> 00:28:37,880
What are you kids doing here?

788
00:28:37,999 --> 00:28:39,319
Get in the car first.

789
00:28:39,319 --> 00:28:40,279
What's going on?

790
00:28:42,239 --> 00:28:43,079
Why are you filming?

791
00:28:43,760 --> 00:28:44,680
If you dare come again,

792
00:28:44,680 --> 00:28:45,840
I'll let you get drenched
in heavy rain.

793
00:28:45,840 --> 00:28:46,319
Don't run!

794
00:28:48,120 --> 00:28:48,880
Stop filming!

795
00:28:53,600 --> 00:28:54,559
Follow me anytime.

796
00:28:57,680 --> 00:28:59,440
Going to find her is life-threatening.

797
00:29:00,160 --> 00:29:02,360
At least three lives are at risk
with the two of us.

798
00:29:02,680 --> 00:29:04,239
Go home. Let's not do this.

799
00:29:04,960 --> 00:29:05,640
Zhixia.

800
00:29:06,680 --> 00:29:07,880
Do you smell that?

801
00:29:08,279 --> 00:29:11,079
Is it just water
inside the kid's water gun? Smell it.

802
00:29:11,719 --> 00:29:12,600
It's really pungent.

803
00:29:12,880 --> 00:29:13,440
Smell it.

804
00:29:13,604 --> 00:29:14,830
- Is it?
- What's that smell?

805
00:29:14,999 --> 00:29:16,079
What's in the water gun?

806
00:29:17,400 --> 00:29:18,840
Open the window.

807
00:29:19,079 --> 00:29:20,759
Did you turn on the seat heater?

808
00:29:20,759 --> 00:29:21,680
No.

809
00:29:24,039 --> 00:29:24,640
Really.

810
00:29:26,120 --> 00:29:28,400
Mom.

811
00:29:28,759 --> 00:29:30,799
Zhilu has been found.

812
00:29:31,400 --> 00:29:34,519
Now Zhixia will go
and inquire a bit more.

813
00:29:34,960 --> 00:29:37,279
Please, show your spirit.

814
00:29:37,840 --> 00:29:40,600
Bless Zhixia.

815
00:29:41,079 --> 00:29:43,519
Bring Zhilu back.

816
00:29:43,880 --> 00:29:45,799
Mom, please show your spirit.

817
00:29:47,048 --> 00:29:48,048
What are you doing?

818
00:29:48,048 --> 00:29:48,470
Mom.

819
00:29:48,479 --> 00:29:49,120
Again.

820
00:29:49,880 --> 00:29:51,200
What? Again?

821
00:29:55,920 --> 00:29:56,559
Come on.

822
00:29:59,120 --> 00:29:59,880
Mingzhu.

823
00:30:01,719 --> 00:30:04,039
Meiqi, pour Mingzhu a glass of water.

824
00:30:05,999 --> 00:30:08,799
I've had the room cleaned
by the housekeeper.

825
00:30:09,279 --> 00:30:11,160
The sheets have been changed too.

826
00:30:14,200 --> 00:30:14,920
Mingzhu,

827
00:30:15,840 --> 00:30:16,960
rest well.

828
00:30:17,600 --> 00:30:18,749
We're just across the way.

829
00:30:18,750 --> 00:30:20,093
Call me if you need anything.

830
00:30:24,039 --> 00:30:24,759
Mingzhu,

831
00:30:25,479 --> 00:30:26,680
give me your phone.

832
00:30:30,799 --> 00:30:32,759
It keeps ringing.

833
00:30:32,759 --> 00:30:34,120
You won't be able to rest.

834
00:30:43,239 --> 00:30:44,120
Alright, let's go.

835
00:30:44,120 --> 00:30:44,799
Meiqi,

836
00:30:45,279 --> 00:30:46,479
stay with Mingzhu.

837
00:30:54,079 --> 00:30:55,160
Drink some water, Mingzhu.

838
00:30:56,559 --> 00:30:57,200
Thanks.

839
00:31:01,719 --> 00:31:03,640
Go inside and rest for a while.

840
00:31:30,360 --> 00:31:31,840
My brother used to say

841
00:31:32,079 --> 00:31:33,640
this spot needs a photo hung.

842
00:31:34,400 --> 00:31:35,200
I found

843
00:31:35,200 --> 00:31:37,079
this group photo on his Moments.

844
00:31:37,400 --> 00:31:38,840
I printed it and hung it up.

845
00:32:18,440 --> 00:32:19,519
Later, our wedding photo

846
00:32:19,519 --> 00:32:21,079
can hang on this wall.

847
00:32:21,079 --> 00:32:22,160
Then, when I lie down,

848
00:32:22,160 --> 00:32:23,469
I can see the photo.

849
00:32:23,470 --> 00:32:25,271
Just thinking about it makes me happy.

850
00:33:08,079 --> 00:33:08,799
Go to the back.

851
00:33:09,671 --> 00:33:10,937
I didn't lock the car.

852
00:33:10,937 --> 00:33:12,448
You can get in once you pull the door.

853
00:33:12,471 --> 00:33:13,160
Okay.

854
00:33:18,799 --> 00:33:19,559
Take it slow.

855
00:33:25,582 --> 00:33:27,715
You won't grow taller holding
an umbrella indoors.

856
00:33:28,880 --> 00:33:29,999
It was raining just now.

857
00:33:30,440 --> 00:33:30,999
Slow down.

858
00:33:30,999 --> 00:33:32,680
Raining? What rain?

859
00:33:33,130 --> 00:33:35,293
Did you always hold
an umbrella indoors as a kid?

860
00:33:35,315 --> 00:33:36,382
Give me a break.

861
00:34:02,740 --> 00:34:06,340
(Award)
(Shen Mingzhu)

862
00:34:10,840 --> 00:34:11,440
You two.

863
00:34:13,360 --> 00:34:13,999
Ma'am.

864
00:34:14,204 --> 00:34:15,310
What would you like to eat?

865
00:34:15,319 --> 00:34:16,239
Is there food?

866
00:34:16,680 --> 00:34:18,479
Of course, how can a restaurant
have no food?

867
00:34:18,479 --> 00:34:19,639
Right, we're here to eat.

868
00:34:20,199 --> 00:34:20,840
Okay.

869
00:34:20,840 --> 00:34:22,639
What would you like to order?

870
00:34:24,440 --> 00:34:25,479
You're so annoying.

871
00:34:26,199 --> 00:34:27,559
What's good to eat?

872
00:34:27,559 --> 00:34:29,720
Braised pork chop,
and Shen family smoked fish.

873
00:34:30,479 --> 00:34:31,720
Add a special fish soup.

874
00:34:31,782 --> 00:34:33,204
The young man knows what to order.

875
00:34:33,226 --> 00:34:34,190
All our specialties.

876
00:34:34,280 --> 00:34:35,915
(Shen Family Smoked Fish)
Did my homework first.

877
00:34:37,999 --> 00:34:39,159
What else would you like?

878
00:34:40,079 --> 00:34:41,199
We'll take a look first.

879
00:34:42,360 --> 00:34:43,079
Take a look.

880
00:34:43,079 --> 00:34:44,519
We'll take a look.

881
00:34:44,519 --> 00:34:45,360
Okay.

882
00:34:45,360 --> 00:34:46,039
Um...

883
00:34:46,880 --> 00:34:48,639
Decide and let me know.

884
00:34:48,639 --> 00:34:50,159
Alright.

885
00:34:56,400 --> 00:34:57,800
One braised pork chop.

886
00:34:57,999 --> 00:34:58,599
And one

887
00:34:58,920 --> 00:34:59,559
smoked fish.

888
00:35:00,039 --> 00:35:01,199
Also, a fish soup.

889
00:35:01,360 --> 00:35:01,960
Zhang Hao,

890
00:35:02,599 --> 00:35:04,320
look in the direction of seven o'clock.

891
00:35:04,679 --> 00:35:05,360
Awards, huh?

892
00:35:05,639 --> 00:35:06,559
The whole wall is

893
00:35:06,559 --> 00:35:07,920
all Shen Mingzhu's.

894
00:35:07,920 --> 00:35:08,999
I'm right here watching.

895
00:35:08,999 --> 00:35:10,639
And the direction of six o'clock.

896
00:35:11,840 --> 00:35:12,519
What's that?

897
00:35:12,519 --> 00:35:13,320
A piano.

898
00:35:13,519 --> 00:35:14,199
Really?

899
00:35:14,199 --> 00:35:14,720
Yes.

900
00:35:15,599 --> 00:35:16,320
Wow.

901
00:35:16,320 --> 00:35:17,679
Also Shen Mingzhu's.

902
00:35:20,479 --> 00:35:22,519
This couple treats her really well.

903
00:35:23,280 --> 00:35:24,119
Seems like it.

904
00:35:24,199 --> 00:35:25,519
These two

905
00:35:26,599 --> 00:35:27,840
seem like good people.

906
00:35:27,960 --> 00:35:29,039
Stop staring over there.

907
00:35:30,920 --> 00:35:32,440
That one, I just...

908
00:35:35,199 --> 00:35:36,720
No yogurt?

909
00:35:37,599 --> 00:35:38,599
No yogurt.

910
00:35:39,159 --> 00:35:40,920
Restaurants usually don't sell yogurt.

911
00:35:41,840 --> 00:35:42,840
You can go next door.

912
00:35:42,920 --> 00:35:44,400
Check the little shop next door.

913
00:35:45,119 --> 00:35:46,159
Okay, thanks.

914
00:35:47,320 --> 00:35:48,119
Where are you going?

915
00:35:48,119 --> 00:35:48,840
To inquire a bit.

916
00:35:48,840 --> 00:35:49,440
Alright.

917
00:35:51,360 --> 00:35:52,960
She's pregnant, craving sour stuff.

918
00:35:57,079 --> 00:35:57,880
This umbrella's good.

919
00:35:57,880 --> 00:35:58,670
Look at this one.

920
00:35:58,671 --> 00:35:59,670
Ma'am, any yogurt?

921
00:35:59,720 --> 00:36:01,360
In the fridge. Check it yourself.

922
00:36:02,360 --> 00:36:04,199
The internet is really advanced now.

923
00:36:04,639 --> 00:36:06,920
This morning, the Shen family
restaurant was surrounded.

924
00:36:07,679 --> 00:36:08,599
That's right.

925
00:36:08,599 --> 00:36:10,440
So many people are taking photos.

926
00:36:10,519 --> 00:36:13,189
The son of the Shen family
ran the water tap around,

927
00:36:13,190 --> 00:36:14,426
and then it dispersed everyone.

928
00:36:14,599 --> 00:36:15,199
How much?

929
00:36:15,720 --> 00:36:16,960
Twenty-five eighty yuan.

930
00:36:17,204 --> 00:36:18,070
I already scanned it.

931
00:36:18,079 --> 00:36:18,840
Alright.

932
00:36:19,226 --> 00:36:20,248
- Bye.
- See you again.

933
00:36:24,960 --> 00:36:25,679
Miss,

934
00:36:25,880 --> 00:36:27,440
want this camel milk powder?

935
00:36:29,119 --> 00:36:30,440
This is authentic.

936
00:36:30,800 --> 00:36:32,720
We are the exclusive distributor.

937
00:36:33,639 --> 00:36:34,479
How much?

938
00:36:34,479 --> 00:36:35,599
One ninety-eight yuan.

939
00:36:36,999 --> 00:36:37,920
Not cheap.

940
00:36:38,559 --> 00:36:40,079
Good stuff, right?

941
00:36:40,079 --> 00:36:42,039
No additives at all.

942
00:36:43,960 --> 00:36:45,639
Then I'll take two cans.

943
00:36:47,119 --> 00:36:47,880
Alright.

944
00:36:47,880 --> 00:36:49,039
I'll pack them for you.

945
00:36:52,119 --> 00:36:55,039
Is the daughter of the Shen family
restaurant next door

946
00:36:55,400 --> 00:36:56,599
not their biological child?

947
00:36:57,079 --> 00:36:58,199
You know that?

948
00:36:59,199 --> 00:37:01,079
The boss said it himself.

949
00:37:01,599 --> 00:37:03,119
Shen Shengli said it himself?

950
00:37:05,039 --> 00:37:06,679
Well, it's not a secret.

951
00:37:06,679 --> 00:37:08,479
Everyone around here knows.

952
00:37:09,720 --> 00:37:10,679
I tell you,

953
00:37:11,079 --> 00:37:13,119
back then, in Yujia Village,

954
00:37:13,119 --> 00:37:14,880
there was a village hospital.

955
00:37:14,999 --> 00:37:16,840
A family had twins,

956
00:37:16,840 --> 00:37:17,960
but couldn't afford both.

957
00:37:18,119 --> 00:37:19,469
The boy was kept,

958
00:37:19,470 --> 00:37:21,182
and the girl was sent
to the Shen family.

959
00:37:24,199 --> 00:37:26,920
That family really was harsh.

960
00:37:27,119 --> 00:37:28,639
Not really fair to say that.

961
00:37:28,639 --> 00:37:30,920
They sent her because
the Shen family was good.

962
00:37:31,280 --> 00:37:33,159
After all these years,

963
00:37:33,199 --> 00:37:35,400
the old Shen couple
treats their daughter

964
00:37:35,400 --> 00:37:36,999
even better than their biological son.

965
00:37:37,199 --> 00:37:38,720
When Mingzhu learned piano as a kid,

966
00:37:38,880 --> 00:37:40,360
they spared no expense.

967
00:37:40,360 --> 00:37:41,880
Minghui wanted a basketball,

968
00:37:41,880 --> 00:37:43,119
but they didn't agree.

969
00:37:45,400 --> 00:37:46,039
That...

970
00:37:46,039 --> 00:37:47,920
This girl's life is pretty good.

971
00:37:47,999 --> 00:37:49,199
Very good.

972
00:37:50,400 --> 00:37:51,039
Not really.

973
00:37:51,039 --> 00:37:52,119
Her husband's dead.

974
00:37:54,159 --> 00:37:55,999
Check out other things.

975
00:37:56,479 --> 00:37:57,039
No need.

976
00:37:57,039 --> 00:37:58,440
How much is it in total?

977
00:37:58,440 --> 00:37:59,639
Alright, let me calculate.

978
00:37:59,639 --> 00:38:00,360
Two boxes.

979
00:38:01,840 --> 00:38:02,800
Total 396 yuan.

980
00:38:05,720 --> 00:38:07,519
What's going on?
The kid's still not back.

981
00:38:07,519 --> 00:38:09,400
Stay calm.

982
00:38:13,880 --> 00:38:15,360
Zhixia is back.

983
00:38:15,360 --> 00:38:16,382
Zhixia, how's it going?

984
00:38:16,440 --> 00:38:17,320
What happened?

985
00:38:17,320 --> 00:38:18,199
Yes, yes.

986
00:38:18,880 --> 00:38:20,599
First, pay for the milk powder.

987
00:38:20,599 --> 00:38:21,599
Three ninety-six yuan.

988
00:38:21,599 --> 00:38:22,679
Round up to 400 yuan.

989
00:38:22,804 --> 00:38:23,550
Five hundred yuan.

990
00:38:23,720 --> 00:38:24,440
Okay, 500 yuan.

991
00:38:24,440 --> 00:38:26,320
I'll transfer five hundred yuan
to you shortly.

992
00:38:26,440 --> 00:38:27,639
You're starting to extort.

993
00:38:27,760 --> 00:38:29,493
Mom and Dad are so easy
to deal with now.

994
00:38:29,493 --> 00:38:30,648
Then why don't you do it?

995
00:38:30,671 --> 00:38:31,790
I don't have startup capital.

996
00:38:31,804 --> 00:38:32,999
Go away. Stop talking.

997
00:38:33,840 --> 00:38:34,519
Zhixia.

998
00:38:34,519 --> 00:38:35,079
Yes.

999
00:38:35,159 --> 00:38:36,440
Have you met her in person?

1000
00:38:36,440 --> 00:38:37,079
Yes.

1001
00:38:38,199 --> 00:38:39,880
Not the real person yet.

1002
00:38:40,400 --> 00:38:41,960
But I met her parents.

1003
00:38:42,079 --> 00:38:43,479
The couple was quite polite.

1004
00:38:43,559 --> 00:38:45,159
They run a small restaurant.

1005
00:38:45,159 --> 00:38:45,999
Business is good.

1006
00:38:45,999 --> 00:38:47,559
Mostly serving locals.

1007
00:38:47,559 --> 00:38:48,159
Right.

1008
00:38:48,559 --> 00:38:51,079
Zhilu is my daughter.

1009
00:38:51,400 --> 00:38:53,559
I am her biological mother.

1010
00:38:53,840 --> 00:38:54,320
No way.

1011
00:38:54,320 --> 00:38:56,679
I have to go fetch
my biological daughter.

1012
00:38:56,840 --> 00:38:57,479
Mom,

1013
00:38:57,479 --> 00:38:59,199
think carefully.

1014
00:38:59,400 --> 00:39:01,559
The Shen family raised this girl.

1015
00:39:01,560 --> 00:39:03,880
Shen Mingzhu never planned
to acknowledge her real parents.

1016
00:39:03,880 --> 00:39:05,720
Now her parents suddenly appear.

1017
00:39:05,920 --> 00:39:07,079
Can she handle it?

1018
00:39:07,199 --> 00:39:08,469
Besides, she's living well.

1019
00:39:08,470 --> 00:39:09,982
Why would she need to acknowledge you?

1020
00:39:10,639 --> 00:39:10,960
This...

1021
00:39:10,960 --> 00:39:12,119
What are you saying?

1022
00:39:12,199 --> 00:39:14,320
We are her biological parents.

1023
00:39:14,320 --> 00:39:14,679
Yes.

1024
00:39:14,679 --> 00:39:16,519
Breaking bones affects the tendons too.

1025
00:39:16,519 --> 00:39:18,519
This isn't up to her.

1026
00:39:18,519 --> 00:39:20,119
The people who sent the girl away

1027
00:39:20,119 --> 00:39:22,440
were us, right?

1028
00:39:22,440 --> 00:39:22,960
Yes...

1029
00:39:22,960 --> 00:39:24,639
The Shen family raised her with care,

1030
00:39:24,639 --> 00:39:25,880
and did a good job.

1031
00:39:25,880 --> 00:39:26,559
She grew up well.

1032
00:39:26,559 --> 00:39:27,960
The family was happy together.

1033
00:39:27,999 --> 00:39:30,559
Now we want to claim her?

1034
00:39:30,720 --> 00:39:32,960
Even robbers wouldn't do this.

1035
00:39:33,599 --> 00:39:34,199
Zhixia.

1036
00:39:34,559 --> 00:39:35,639
I have a question.

1037
00:39:36,639 --> 00:39:39,199
How can we prove
that our biological parents

1038
00:39:39,199 --> 00:39:40,999
are Shen Mingzhu's biological parents?

1039
00:39:41,280 --> 00:39:42,840
What nonsense is that?

1040
00:39:43,440 --> 00:39:46,199
Location and time of giving the child,

1041
00:39:46,519 --> 00:39:48,199
child's birth date,

1042
00:39:48,199 --> 00:39:49,199
all match.

1043
00:39:49,199 --> 00:39:50,880
Looks match too.

1044
00:39:50,880 --> 00:39:52,400
But no solid proof.

1045
00:39:53,920 --> 00:39:54,720
No solid...

1046
00:39:54,720 --> 00:39:55,360
Wait.

1047
00:39:55,999 --> 00:39:56,720
Zhixia.

1048
00:39:57,360 --> 00:39:58,599
Call that little girl out.

1049
00:39:58,999 --> 00:40:01,039
A paternity test will settle it.

1050
00:40:01,039 --> 00:40:02,639
Once tested, we'll know.

1051
00:40:02,720 --> 00:40:04,199
Paternity test, good idea.

1052
00:40:04,199 --> 00:40:04,720
Right?

1053
00:40:04,720 --> 00:40:05,920
Great idea.

1054
00:40:06,400 --> 00:40:07,479
The problem is, why would

1055
00:40:07,479 --> 00:40:09,679
Shen Mingzhu take a paternity test
with you?

1056
00:40:10,119 --> 00:40:11,999
She'd be nice not to hate you.

1057
00:40:11,999 --> 00:40:12,710
- No.
- Go away.

1058
00:40:12,715 --> 00:40:13,630
We have no choice.

1059
00:40:13,639 --> 00:40:15,840
This is all because of the old lady.

1060
00:40:15,840 --> 00:40:17,159
No choice?

1061
00:40:17,159 --> 00:40:18,440
How can you blame my mom?

1062
00:40:18,440 --> 00:40:19,559
You say it's not her fault?

1063
00:40:19,559 --> 00:40:20,240
Whose fault then?

1064
00:40:20,240 --> 00:40:21,079
Yours.

1065
00:40:21,079 --> 00:40:22,549
I'm in prison.

1066
00:40:22,550 --> 00:40:24,004
Yes, because you're in prison,

1067
00:40:24,048 --> 00:40:25,190
the child couldn't survive.

1068
00:40:25,199 --> 00:40:27,440
Stop! All you do is argue!

1069
00:40:29,199 --> 00:40:31,119
Why didn't you give me away back then?

1070
00:40:31,119 --> 00:40:32,360
You were a bit older.

1071
00:40:32,720 --> 00:40:34,159
Then you should have been given away.

1072
00:40:34,440 --> 00:40:35,639
No one should stop me.

1073
00:40:35,639 --> 00:40:37,679
I'm going to fetch my daughter.

1074
00:40:37,679 --> 00:40:39,119
If you go now,

1075
00:40:39,119 --> 00:40:40,199
my plan

1076
00:40:40,199 --> 00:40:41,720
will be useless.

1077
00:40:47,280 --> 00:40:48,039
Zhixia.

1078
00:40:49,199 --> 00:40:50,039
Come.

1079
00:40:50,039 --> 00:40:51,119
Yes, Zhixia.

1080
00:40:51,199 --> 00:40:53,320
Hurry, sit down.

1081
00:40:53,599 --> 00:40:54,360
Come, come.

1082
00:40:56,360 --> 00:40:57,159
Zhixia.

1083
00:40:57,960 --> 00:41:00,519
From now on, Mom and Dad won't argue.

1084
00:41:00,519 --> 00:41:01,519
Won't argue.

1085
00:41:01,519 --> 00:41:02,599
We'll listen to you.

1086
00:41:02,679 --> 00:41:03,880
Yes, we'll listen to you.

1087
00:41:07,039 --> 00:41:07,840
Zhixia.

1088
00:41:08,440 --> 00:41:09,720
Got any good ideas?

1089
00:41:10,039 --> 00:41:11,960
Tell Mom and Dad.

1090
00:41:17,693 --> 00:41:18,630
Didn't Shen Mingzhu

1091
00:41:18,639 --> 00:41:20,880
have her prenatal checkups
at the People's Hospital?

1092
00:41:21,920 --> 00:41:25,199
I originally planned to give birth
at the Maternal and Child Hospital.

1093
00:41:25,679 --> 00:41:28,599
Now I might as well transfer
to the People's Hospital.

1094
00:41:28,720 --> 00:41:30,960
Our pregnancy timelines
are almost the same.

1095
00:41:31,840 --> 00:41:33,039
I'll find an opportunity

1096
00:41:33,039 --> 00:41:34,320
to get close to her.

1097
00:41:34,760 --> 00:41:35,920
Gradually build a connection.

1098
00:41:36,320 --> 00:41:37,479
Flirt indirectly.

1099
00:41:38,880 --> 00:41:39,639
Good idea.

1100
00:41:39,639 --> 00:41:40,280
Alright.

1101
00:41:42,880 --> 00:41:43,880
Zhixia,

1102
00:41:44,440 --> 00:41:45,280
well,

1103
00:41:45,999 --> 00:41:49,039
how is Zhilu doing now?

1104
00:41:49,360 --> 00:41:50,840
Is she living well?

1105
00:41:50,840 --> 00:41:51,679
Well?

1106
00:41:51,679 --> 00:41:55,559
Basically, as I had expected.

1107
00:41:56,840 --> 00:41:58,199
"Zhilu" you mentioned...

1108
00:41:58,440 --> 00:41:59,079
Zhilu.

1109
00:41:59,079 --> 00:41:59,960
Shen Mingzhu.

1110
00:42:01,079 --> 00:42:02,119
She's doing pretty well.

1111
00:42:02,210 --> 00:42:04,180
She's been learning piano
since elementary school.

1112
00:42:04,182 --> 00:42:05,630
Her awards cover the whole wall.

1113
00:42:05,639 --> 00:42:06,550
Much better than me...

1114
00:42:07,639 --> 00:42:09,199
Better than Xu Zhidong.

1115
00:42:09,559 --> 00:42:10,989
She really is my daughter!

1116
00:42:10,990 --> 00:42:12,848
Why don't you mention
that her husband died?

1117
00:42:13,039 --> 00:42:14,199
Why bring me up?

1118
00:42:14,248 --> 00:42:16,248
If you stay silent,
no one thinks you're mute.

1119
00:42:22,999 --> 00:42:23,880
Mom.

1120
00:42:23,880 --> 00:42:26,199
Her husband died,
and she can find another one.

1121
00:42:27,039 --> 00:42:31,240
Why does this child
have such a hard life?

1122
00:42:32,119 --> 00:42:32,720
Enough.

1123
00:42:33,479 --> 00:42:34,079
