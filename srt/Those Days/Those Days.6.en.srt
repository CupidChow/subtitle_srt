=Those Days=

00:01:12,431 --> 00:01:14,800
(Adapted from iceread.com novel
"You Xi" by Qingyang Wanxi)

3
00:01:15,220 --> 00:01:17,780
=Episode 6=

4
00:01:31,839 --> 00:01:32,440
Mrs. Feng.

5
00:01:32,440 --> 00:01:33,080
Mingzhu.

6
00:01:33,080 --> 00:01:33,720
Mr. Feng.

7
00:01:33,919 --> 00:01:34,839
Mingzhu's up.

8
00:01:35,919 --> 00:01:37,399
I only meant to take a nap,

9
00:01:38,360 --> 00:01:40,360
but I slept all the way till now.

10
00:01:40,919 --> 00:01:41,919
It's already dark out.

11
00:01:42,279 --> 00:01:43,000
That's alright.

12
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:44,919
You really should get some proper rest.

13
00:01:45,279 --> 00:01:45,960
Come, sit down.

14
00:01:48,800 --> 00:01:49,919
For now,

15
00:01:50,679 --> 00:01:52,240
you don't need to rush back to work.

16
00:01:52,759 --> 00:01:55,119
Your father already spoke
with your boss.

17
00:01:55,119 --> 00:01:55,720
That's right.

18
00:01:57,880 --> 00:02:00,240
I ordered you a maternity meal plan.

19
00:02:01,720 --> 00:02:02,800
Their ingredients

20
00:02:02,800 --> 00:02:03,720
are all organic.

21
00:02:03,720 --> 00:02:04,950
You can eat with peace of mind.

22
00:02:05,919 --> 00:02:07,399
And there's premium bird's nest too.

23
00:02:07,839 --> 00:02:08,839
It's expensive,

24
00:02:08,919 --> 00:02:10,240
but worth every penny.

25
00:02:10,399 --> 00:02:11,839
I don't need anything that fancy.

26
00:02:12,199 --> 00:02:14,160
Some prenatal vitamins are enough.

27
00:02:14,160 --> 00:02:14,919
No way.

28
00:02:15,440 --> 00:02:17,319
You need to eat well and stay healthy.

29
00:02:17,759 --> 00:02:19,800
You're carrying
the Feng family's grandchild.

30
00:02:22,480 --> 00:02:24,080
Whether the baby is healthy or not,

31
00:02:24,630 --> 00:02:25,920
I'll need to do another check-up.

32
00:02:29,040 --> 00:02:29,960
Besides,

33
00:02:31,200 --> 00:02:33,240
I still haven't decided
whether to keep it.

34
00:02:34,599 --> 00:02:35,439
I'm sorry.

35
00:02:36,439 --> 00:02:37,200
Mingzhu,

36
00:02:37,200 --> 00:02:38,320
what's wrong with you, child?

37
00:02:38,320 --> 00:02:40,399
Didn't we already talk about this?

38
00:02:40,399 --> 00:02:41,839
Everything was settled, wasn't it?

39
00:02:41,839 --> 00:02:43,320
What are you still worried about?

40
00:02:44,559 --> 00:02:45,119
You...

41
00:02:45,200 --> 00:02:46,800
You and Jianqi loved each other so much.

42
00:02:46,800 --> 00:02:48,760
Don't you want to keep something of his?

43
00:02:53,399 --> 00:02:54,439
It's decided then.

44
00:02:55,839 --> 00:02:56,920
I've already ordered

45
00:02:57,200 --> 00:02:59,200
the maternity meals until your due date.

46
00:02:59,200 --> 00:03:01,839
After that, it'll switch
to postpartum meals.

47
00:03:02,439 --> 00:03:04,040
This is my decision to make.

48
00:03:05,200 --> 00:03:06,920
This child isn't just Jianqi's.

49
00:03:08,040 --> 00:03:08,960
It's mine too.

50
00:03:09,839 --> 00:03:11,119
You girl, how could you...

51
00:03:11,119 --> 00:03:12,399
- I...
- Alright, enough.

52
00:03:12,800 --> 00:03:14,119
We've said enough.

53
00:03:14,960 --> 00:03:18,399
Let Mingzhu decide for herself.

54
00:03:23,240 --> 00:03:24,599
Fine.

55
00:03:25,360 --> 00:03:25,960
Mrs. Feng.

56
00:03:27,879 --> 00:03:29,559
Can I have my phone back?

57
00:03:32,999 --> 00:03:33,999
I turned it off already.

58
00:03:33,999 --> 00:03:34,999
It was too noisy.

59
00:03:36,480 --> 00:03:38,119
Now eat, alright?

60
00:03:54,879 --> 00:03:55,800
Hello, Doctor.

61
00:03:56,119 --> 00:03:56,760
Hello.

62
00:04:00,480 --> 00:04:03,599
Aren't you the doctor who stood up

63
00:04:03,960 --> 00:04:05,640
for the hero's wife?

64
00:04:07,159 --> 00:04:08,279
Not just a good doctor,

65
00:04:08,279 --> 00:04:09,360
but a brave man too.

66
00:04:09,520 --> 00:04:10,879
I just saw your video.

67
00:04:15,800 --> 00:04:17,159
What seems to be the problem?

68
00:04:19,119 --> 00:04:21,279
This is my second pregnancy,
eight weeks in.

69
00:04:21,800 --> 00:04:23,360
With my first child,

70
00:04:23,360 --> 00:04:24,920
I didn't have any morning sickness.

71
00:04:24,920 --> 00:04:26,440
But this time I've been vomiting a lot,

72
00:04:26,450 --> 00:04:27,159
and quite badly.

73
00:04:27,159 --> 00:04:28,599
It comes without warning.

74
00:04:29,640 --> 00:04:32,080
Could it be because of my age?

75
00:04:32,479 --> 00:04:33,239
What do you think?

76
00:04:37,799 --> 00:04:38,839
Maybe that's part of it.

77
00:04:39,279 --> 00:04:40,880
Stay positive and eat well.

78
00:04:40,880 --> 00:04:41,839
You'll be fine.

79
00:04:44,239 --> 00:04:45,839
That makes me feel much better.

80
00:04:48,080 --> 00:04:49,640
Her name is Shen Mingzhu, right?

81
00:04:49,880 --> 00:04:51,719
Did she register here?

82
00:04:52,279 --> 00:04:53,520
Why are you asking?

83
00:04:55,799 --> 00:04:56,960
Just curious.

84
00:04:58,080 --> 00:04:59,520
Middle-aged women love to pry

85
00:05:00,200 --> 00:05:00,880
and gossip.

86
00:05:01,039 --> 00:05:03,279
Less gossip is better
for both body and mind.

87
00:05:05,620 --> 00:05:06,950
Come, let's do another ultrasound.

88
00:05:06,960 --> 00:05:08,260
Pay at the counter to the right.

89
00:05:09,440 --> 00:05:10,159
Thank you.

90
00:05:21,479 --> 00:05:22,320
Sing one.

91
00:05:24,680 --> 00:05:25,520
Alright.

92
00:05:25,520 --> 00:05:27,560
I'll sing one I actually know.

93
00:05:28,450 --> 00:05:29,359
Make it a cheerful one.

94
00:05:29,359 --> 00:05:29,960
Okay.

95
00:05:30,919 --> 00:05:33,200
♪Even if fate tosses and turns♪

96
00:05:33,200 --> 00:05:34,719
♪Even if fate twists in strange ways♪

97
00:05:34,719 --> 00:05:36,479
♪Even if fate tries to scare you♪

98
00:05:36,479 --> 00:05:37,799
♪Life may lose its fun♪

99
00:05:37,799 --> 00:05:39,599
♪Don't cry or be bitter♪

100
00:05:40,080 --> 00:05:41,880
♪And never give up♪

101
00:05:42,880 --> 00:05:46,440
♪I wish to stay by your side for life♪

102
00:05:51,640 --> 00:05:52,320
Darling.

103
00:05:52,570 --> 00:05:53,760
You're going to be a dad soon.

104
00:05:53,760 --> 00:05:54,799
How do you feel?

105
00:05:55,960 --> 00:05:57,200
How do I feel?

106
00:05:59,239 --> 00:06:01,640
I think I can express it through a song.

107
00:06:01,640 --> 00:06:02,479
Then sing it.

108
00:06:02,599 --> 00:06:03,320
I will.

109
00:06:04,540 --> 00:06:05,640
What were the lyrics again?

110
00:06:08,680 --> 00:06:09,320
What's wrong?

111
00:06:10,159 --> 00:06:11,359
Take this to your sister.

112
00:06:11,620 --> 00:06:12,440
- Okay.
- Fish soup.

113
00:06:12,440 --> 00:06:14,159
Your dad's been
simmering it all morning.

114
00:06:14,320 --> 00:06:14,880
Alright.

115
00:06:15,279 --> 00:06:17,359
Where are the car keys?

116
00:06:18,039 --> 00:06:18,719
Right here.

117
00:06:18,960 --> 00:06:19,790
I'm heading out, Mom.

118
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:21,000
Hold it steady.

119
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:22,359
- I will.
- Don't spill it.

120
00:06:23,120 --> 00:06:23,719
Dad.

121
00:06:26,599 --> 00:06:27,350
When you get there,

122
00:06:28,080 --> 00:06:29,960
take your sister out for a walk.

123
00:06:30,799 --> 00:06:32,359
She shouldn't stay home all day.

124
00:06:32,440 --> 00:06:34,239
Her mind is still on Feng Jianqi.

125
00:06:34,719 --> 00:06:35,359
Got it.

126
00:06:36,200 --> 00:06:36,919
I'm going.

127
00:06:38,359 --> 00:06:38,960
Go slow.

128
00:06:38,960 --> 00:06:39,520
Okay.

129
00:06:41,839 --> 00:06:43,359
Why are you painting again?

130
00:06:43,359 --> 00:06:45,200
Didn't Jianqi already paint this?

131
00:06:45,200 --> 00:06:46,680
Look at what he did.

132
00:06:47,080 --> 00:06:48,200
He barely put in any effort.

133
00:06:52,880 --> 00:06:55,239
That boy was never meant for hard work.

134
00:06:59,560 --> 00:07:00,200
You know,

135
00:07:01,719 --> 00:07:02,599
if we hadn't

136
00:07:03,520 --> 00:07:05,560
let him stay in our home back then,

137
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:10,000
maybe none of this would have happened.

138
00:07:11,520 --> 00:07:13,680
Why think about it now?

139
00:07:13,680 --> 00:07:14,560
It's all over.

140
00:07:14,560 --> 00:07:16,359
Thinking won't change anything.

141
00:07:17,919 --> 00:07:19,279
Come on, forget it.

142
00:07:19,560 --> 00:07:20,120
Let's go.

143
00:07:21,760 --> 00:07:23,159
Hurry up. Look at you.

144
00:07:27,620 --> 00:07:31,760
(Xin City Grand Court)

145
00:07:31,760 --> 00:07:32,359
Hello.

146
00:07:36,170 --> 00:07:37,200
Hey, open the gate, buddy.

147
00:07:37,839 --> 00:07:38,399
Hello.

148
00:07:38,680 --> 00:07:40,399
Who are you here to see?

149
00:07:40,680 --> 00:07:42,239
Building Six, Unit 8002.

150
00:07:42,239 --> 00:07:43,150
I'm visiting my sister.

151
00:07:43,399 --> 00:07:44,039
Please hold on.

152
00:07:48,120 --> 00:07:49,599
Hello, homeowner.

153
00:07:49,599 --> 00:07:50,279
There's a...

154
00:07:51,250 --> 00:07:52,159
Sir, your name please?

155
00:07:52,320 --> 00:07:53,080
Shen.

156
00:07:53,560 --> 00:07:55,080
A Mr. Shen is here to see you.

157
00:07:56,560 --> 00:07:57,399
Alright.

158
00:07:58,960 --> 00:07:59,440
Sir.

159
00:07:59,440 --> 00:08:00,930
Please park your bike at the entrance.

160
00:08:00,960 --> 00:08:02,550
The resident will come down to meet you.

161
00:08:15,399 --> 00:08:15,799
Meiqi.

162
00:08:16,359 --> 00:08:17,000
Hi.

163
00:08:23,680 --> 00:08:24,599
So polite.

164
00:08:25,120 --> 00:08:27,000
You even came down yourself to get me.

165
00:08:28,090 --> 00:08:29,950
The main gate
and the elevator need a key card.

166
00:08:30,080 --> 00:08:31,399
Without me, you couldn't get in.

167
00:08:32,960 --> 00:08:35,719
High-end communities
really are different.

168
00:08:36,680 --> 00:08:37,719
That's why they're safe.

169
00:08:37,719 --> 00:08:39,479
No outsiders can get in.

170
00:08:41,080 --> 00:08:41,719
Meiqi.

171
00:08:42,440 --> 00:08:43,800
Let's have dinner together tonight.

172
00:08:44,239 --> 00:08:44,839
I'm busy.

173
00:08:50,839 --> 00:08:51,780
I wasn't talking to you.

174
00:08:53,599 --> 00:08:54,320
I'm busy tonight.

175
00:08:54,320 --> 00:08:55,960
I'm having dinner at home.

176
00:08:59,599 --> 00:09:00,719
When we get married,

177
00:09:00,719 --> 00:09:02,410
we can hang
our wedding photo on this wall.

178
00:09:03,460 --> 00:09:05,200
Don't people
usually hang it above the bed?

179
00:09:05,200 --> 00:09:06,200
Why here?

180
00:09:06,200 --> 00:09:07,239
This way when I lie down,

181
00:09:07,239 --> 00:09:08,599
I can see it right away.

182
00:09:08,599 --> 00:09:10,160
Just thinking about it makes me happy.

183
00:09:10,800 --> 00:09:12,960
You really have a high happiness index.

184
00:09:31,960 --> 00:09:32,839
Is my sister asleep?

185
00:09:32,839 --> 00:09:33,440
No.

186
00:09:36,680 --> 00:09:37,560
Wear slippers.

187
00:09:37,580 --> 00:09:38,800
It's more comfortable barefoot.

188
00:09:52,320 --> 00:09:54,879
Mingzhu, I brought you some fish soup.

189
00:09:57,160 --> 00:09:58,400
I'll be right out.

190
00:10:13,280 --> 00:10:14,710
You don't need to bring soup anymore.

191
00:10:14,960 --> 00:10:16,440
Mom ordered nutritional soup for her.

192
00:10:16,519 --> 00:10:18,639
A five-star chef makes it.
It's really expensive.

193
00:10:19,359 --> 00:10:21,040
But can it
ever taste like Mom's cooking?

194
00:10:29,879 --> 00:10:30,440
Minghui.

195
00:10:30,440 --> 00:10:31,040
Mingzhu.

196
00:10:32,280 --> 00:10:33,639
Here, have some soup.

197
00:10:33,639 --> 00:10:34,560
It's still hot.

198
00:10:35,759 --> 00:10:37,200
Didn't you have tutoring today?

199
00:10:37,960 --> 00:10:38,999
It's pointless anyway.

200
00:10:39,080 --> 00:10:40,160
Why waste the money?

201
00:10:41,200 --> 00:10:42,759
Come on, try it.

202
00:10:48,410 --> 00:10:49,200
Does it taste good?

203
00:10:50,719 --> 00:10:52,150
This tastes just like Mom's cooking.

204
00:10:52,639 --> 00:10:53,359
This afternoon Mom

205
00:10:53,359 --> 00:10:55,510
even asked Dad to catch
an old hen in the countryside.

206
00:10:55,980 --> 00:10:57,320
You'll have chicken soup tomorrow.

207
00:10:57,320 --> 00:10:59,080
Tell Mom not to work so hard.

208
00:10:59,599 --> 00:11:01,080
I can't eat that much anyway.

209
00:11:01,080 --> 00:11:02,599
That won't do, Mingzhu.

210
00:11:03,999 --> 00:11:05,639
It's better for Mom to stay busy.

211
00:11:05,640 --> 00:11:06,680
Otherwise she'll just keep nagging.

212
00:11:06,680 --> 00:11:07,680
It drives everyone crazy.

213
00:11:11,960 --> 00:11:13,440
I really can't drink anymore.

214
00:11:14,519 --> 00:11:15,479
Help me finish it.

215
00:11:15,800 --> 00:11:16,920
You've only had a little.

216
00:11:17,359 --> 00:11:17,920
No.

217
00:11:18,479 --> 00:11:20,080
Mom said you have to drink more.

218
00:11:20,260 --> 00:11:21,780
Even if you're full, you still have to.

219
00:11:22,359 --> 00:11:23,479
Just think of it as medicine.

220
00:11:24,440 --> 00:11:26,080
That's such an old-fashioned idea.

221
00:11:26,519 --> 00:11:27,599
Mingzhu, drink if you want.

222
00:11:27,599 --> 00:11:28,599
If you don't, then don't.

223
00:11:28,719 --> 00:11:29,920
Do whatever feels comfortable.

224
00:11:30,839 --> 00:11:31,599
I know.

225
00:11:33,320 --> 00:11:34,200
By the way, Meiqi.

226
00:11:34,839 --> 00:11:35,680
Could you please

227
00:11:35,680 --> 00:11:37,200
help Minghui get an elevator card?

228
00:11:37,400 --> 00:11:38,960
It'll be easier for him to visit.

229
00:11:39,519 --> 00:11:40,999
You won't have to go down each time.

230
00:11:42,560 --> 00:11:43,759
Thank you, Meiqi.

231
00:11:49,440 --> 00:11:50,160
No way.

232
00:11:51,639 --> 00:11:53,800
Why should Shen Minghui
have an elevator card?

233
00:11:54,080 --> 00:11:55,119
Soon all his relatives

234
00:11:55,119 --> 00:11:56,639
will be coming over.

235
00:11:56,639 --> 00:11:57,320
What then?

236
00:11:57,719 --> 00:11:59,239
It'll be chaos. Absolutely not.

237
00:12:00,200 --> 00:12:01,759
You think I want to give him one?

238
00:12:01,759 --> 00:12:03,280
Just looking at him annoys me.

239
00:12:03,519 --> 00:12:04,759
He clearly has no manners.

240
00:12:05,639 --> 00:12:06,999
Mingzhu, don't bother.

241
00:12:07,560 --> 00:12:09,759
Mom said you just need
to eat well and rest well.

242
00:12:09,759 --> 00:12:10,910
Don't worry about anything else.

243
00:12:10,920 --> 00:12:12,359
She's already working hard enough.

244
00:12:12,359 --> 00:12:13,599
I'll wash these dishes for you.

245
00:12:14,920 --> 00:12:15,599
Alright then.

246
00:12:17,440 --> 00:12:19,160
Are you keeping up with your studies?

247
00:12:19,960 --> 00:12:21,450
We've reviewed everything several times.

248
00:12:21,479 --> 00:12:22,479
I'm fine.

249
00:12:22,479 --> 00:12:23,519
Work harder.

250
00:12:24,560 --> 00:12:26,599
Jianqi spent a lot of time tutoring you.

251
00:12:26,719 --> 00:12:27,519
I know.

252
00:12:28,200 --> 00:12:29,440
I'll study hard.

253
00:12:29,999 --> 00:12:32,719
So Jianqi can rest
in peace with a smile.

254
00:12:35,560 --> 00:12:36,200
Mingzhu.

255
00:12:37,119 --> 00:12:38,680
Are you getting used to living here?

256
00:12:40,800 --> 00:12:41,440
It's fine.

257
00:12:42,759 --> 00:12:44,440
Why don't you come home with me?

258
00:12:45,440 --> 00:12:47,359
It's better for everyone if I stay here.

259
00:12:47,519 --> 00:12:49,080
You look so tired.

260
00:12:49,090 --> 00:12:50,839
You shouldn't
keep pushing yourself like this.

261
00:12:50,839 --> 00:12:51,479
It's alright.

262
00:12:52,200 --> 00:12:53,400
I'll adjust.

263
00:12:55,239 --> 00:12:56,440
Take good care of yourself.

264
00:12:57,320 --> 00:12:58,599
No matter what, I'll support you.

265
00:12:59,310 --> 00:13:00,680
If you really want to support me,

266
00:13:00,680 --> 00:13:02,200
then focus on your studies.

267
00:13:05,040 --> 00:13:05,680
Mingzhu.

268
00:13:05,680 --> 00:13:07,320
My Mom asked me to bring you some nuts.

269
00:13:07,920 --> 00:13:08,560
Thanks.

270
00:13:09,080 --> 00:13:09,719
Meiqi.

271
00:13:10,599 --> 00:13:11,960
Did you get the elevator card made?

272
00:13:13,639 --> 00:13:14,759
Not yet.

273
00:13:17,119 --> 00:13:19,239
Mom wants to know
what Minghui wants for dinner.

274
00:13:19,239 --> 00:13:20,440
She'll have housekeeper cook.

275
00:13:20,440 --> 00:13:21,200
No need.

276
00:13:21,759 --> 00:13:22,960
Minghui's leaving soon.

277
00:13:24,560 --> 00:13:26,320
Don't go yet. You rarely come by.

278
00:13:26,519 --> 00:13:27,400
It's not rare.

279
00:13:27,960 --> 00:13:30,130
I'll be back tomorrow
with chicken soup for my sister.

280
00:13:30,999 --> 00:13:32,040
This is my sister's home.

281
00:13:32,560 --> 00:13:34,080
I can come whenever I want.

282
00:13:35,119 --> 00:13:36,239
And leave whenever I want.

283
00:13:37,639 --> 00:13:38,599
Fine, see yourself out.

284
00:13:38,760 --> 00:13:40,750
You don't need a card to go down.
Just press "1."

285
00:13:42,479 --> 00:13:43,320
I'm leaving, Mingzhu.

286
00:13:44,080 --> 00:13:45,080
Take care of yourself.

287
00:13:45,359 --> 00:13:46,239
Go slow.

288
00:13:47,239 --> 00:13:47,879
Bye.

289
00:13:48,040 --> 00:13:48,639
Bye.

290
00:13:53,960 --> 00:13:56,680
Copying others and losing your own way.
Faking it to join the crowd.

291
00:13:56,680 --> 00:13:57,560
Covering your ears
while stealing a bell.

292
00:13:57,560 --> 00:13:58,280
Zhixia...

293
00:13:59,239 --> 00:13:59,839
Look.

294
00:14:00,040 --> 00:14:02,239
I found Shen Mingzhu's
piano lesson account.

295
00:14:02,719 --> 00:14:04,879
She teaches kids piano online.

296
00:14:04,879 --> 00:14:05,950
Two hundred yuan per lesson.

297
00:14:07,719 --> 00:14:08,359
Then do this.

298
00:14:08,479 --> 00:14:09,560
Contact her right away.

299
00:14:09,560 --> 00:14:11,680
Tell her our kid
wants to take piano lessons from her.

300
00:14:21,119 --> 00:14:21,920
Hello.

301
00:14:22,119 --> 00:14:23,359
Hello, Ms. Shen.

302
00:14:24,599 --> 00:14:25,920
Ms. Shen, here's the situation.

303
00:14:26,080 --> 00:14:27,160
Our child

304
00:14:27,359 --> 00:14:28,960
has a piano competition tomorrow.

305
00:14:31,119 --> 00:14:33,479
We were hoping
you could give her a short lesson.

306
00:14:34,080 --> 00:14:35,260
I'm not available these days.

307
00:14:35,719 --> 00:14:37,519
You might want to find another teacher.

308
00:14:37,519 --> 00:14:39,839
It could just be an online session.

309
00:14:40,839 --> 00:14:42,599
Ms. Shen, it's really urgent.

310
00:14:43,680 --> 00:14:45,200
It'll only take a few minutes, alright?

311
00:14:45,560 --> 00:14:46,879
Add me on WeChat.

312
00:14:46,879 --> 00:14:47,639
We can talk there.

313
00:14:48,280 --> 00:14:49,759
Okay, give me a second.

314
00:14:52,960 --> 00:14:53,560
What's your ID?

315
00:14:58,719 --> 00:15:00,680
I've added you,
please accept the request.

316
00:15:01,040 --> 00:15:01,639
Alright.

317
00:15:02,759 --> 00:15:03,879
Thank you.

318
00:15:10,599 --> 00:15:12,040
Got it, she accepted.

319
00:15:14,719 --> 00:15:16,280
But I'm not in a competition tomorrow.

320
00:15:22,879 --> 00:15:23,519
Jiao.

321
00:15:24,040 --> 00:15:25,999
Don't you have a concert
at the end of the year?

322
00:15:26,879 --> 00:15:28,040
Your teacher tomorrow

323
00:15:28,519 --> 00:15:29,800
will be watching quietly.

324
00:15:29,999 --> 00:15:32,359
They'll pick one student
for the featured performance.

325
00:15:32,680 --> 00:15:34,800
That's basically a competition,

326
00:15:34,800 --> 00:15:35,440
isn't it?

327
00:15:36,680 --> 00:15:37,960
Then I want some spicy sticks.

328
00:15:38,150 --> 00:15:39,400
- No, you can't.
- Yes, I can.

329
00:15:41,400 --> 00:15:43,479
You can, but you have to listen to me.

330
00:15:49,719 --> 00:15:50,519
Hello.

331
00:15:57,879 --> 00:15:58,519
Hello.

332
00:15:59,800 --> 00:16:01,040
Yes, the signal is good.

333
00:16:02,200 --> 00:16:02,800
I...

334
00:16:03,999 --> 00:16:05,359
This is my daughter, Jiao.

335
00:16:05,359 --> 00:16:06,160
Say hello to Ms. Shen.

336
00:16:06,160 --> 00:16:07,200
Hello, Ms. Shen.

337
00:16:07,200 --> 00:16:08,080
Hello, Jiao.

338
00:16:08,200 --> 00:16:09,999
Ms. Shen...

339
00:16:11,479 --> 00:16:13,400
I'll let Jiao
play a short piece for you.

340
00:16:13,400 --> 00:16:14,960
You can listen and see what you think.

341
00:16:15,839 --> 00:16:16,160
Sure.

342
00:16:16,160 --> 00:16:17,359
My homework isn't done yet.

343
00:16:17,960 --> 00:16:18,599
Spicy sticks.

344
00:16:19,280 --> 00:16:20,080
Wait a moment.

345
00:16:23,759 --> 00:16:25,119
Look, doesn't she look like her?

346
00:16:26,080 --> 00:16:28,160
That one, look at her.

347
00:16:29,599 --> 00:16:31,040
She looks a bit like you.

348
00:16:31,440 --> 00:16:32,239
That's not me.

349
00:16:33,440 --> 00:16:35,839
Doesn't she look like Zhidong?

350
00:16:36,479 --> 00:16:38,080
The nose and eyes.

351
00:16:38,239 --> 00:16:39,239
A little like Zhidong.

352
00:16:39,239 --> 00:16:40,879
Yeah, I think so too.

353
00:17:04,680 --> 00:17:05,280
Jiao.

354
00:17:08,599 --> 00:17:09,719
Come here, Jiao.

355
00:17:10,400 --> 00:17:10,960
Jiao.

356
00:17:11,519 --> 00:17:14,039
This piece has many high double notes.

357
00:17:14,559 --> 00:17:16,160
So you need to play them lightly.

358
00:17:16,680 --> 00:17:17,680
Sometimes playing lightly

359
00:17:17,680 --> 00:17:19,200
is even harder than playing loud.

360
00:17:19,640 --> 00:17:21,600
Try to imagine your fingers

361
00:17:21,880 --> 00:17:24,079
touching the ripples on a calm lake.

362
00:17:31,640 --> 00:17:33,279
Yes, that's it.

363
00:17:34,120 --> 00:17:35,960
You understand right after I say it.

364
00:17:36,039 --> 00:17:37,680
You have real talent for music.

365
00:17:38,079 --> 00:17:40,239
Ms. Shen, I really like you.

366
00:17:40,440 --> 00:17:41,999
Can you be my teacher from now on?

367
00:17:43,400 --> 00:17:43,999
Jiao.

368
00:17:44,360 --> 00:17:45,440
Ms. Shen is very busy.

369
00:17:45,440 --> 00:17:46,799
You can practice on your own.

370
00:17:48,559 --> 00:17:49,279
Ms. Shen.

371
00:17:52,160 --> 00:17:52,880
Ms. Shen.

372
00:17:53,440 --> 00:17:54,279
Thank you.

373
00:17:55,680 --> 00:17:56,680
How much is the fee?

374
00:17:56,799 --> 00:17:57,680
Is there a discount?

375
00:17:58,039 --> 00:17:58,799
No need.

376
00:17:59,799 --> 00:18:01,880
If the child's feet can reach,

377
00:18:01,880 --> 00:18:03,039
she can use the pedal.

378
00:18:03,360 --> 00:18:05,039
Feel how the sound lingers.

379
00:18:05,239 --> 00:18:06,239
It's very beautiful.

380
00:18:08,200 --> 00:18:09,680
If anything comes up later,

381
00:18:09,680 --> 00:18:10,559
you can contact me.

382
00:18:11,279 --> 00:18:12,370
Let's leave it here for now.

383
00:18:12,880 --> 00:18:13,400
Okay.

384
00:18:14,360 --> 00:18:14,960
Goodbye.

385
00:18:15,120 --> 00:18:15,640
Goodbye.

386
00:18:22,239 --> 00:18:23,640
It must be fate.

387
00:18:25,120 --> 00:18:26,279
She teaches piano.

388
00:18:27,719 --> 00:18:29,559
And Jiao happens to learn piano.

389
00:18:35,960 --> 00:18:38,880
Her smile feels so warm.

390
00:18:39,160 --> 00:18:42,719
There's something so familiar about her.

391
00:18:44,640 --> 00:18:45,440
Do you think

392
00:18:46,440 --> 00:18:48,239
she could actually be my real sister?

393
00:18:59,279 --> 00:18:59,880
Hello.

394
00:19:09,319 --> 00:19:10,559
I saw that.

395
00:19:11,319 --> 00:19:12,799
You didn't even ring our doorbell.

396
00:19:12,799 --> 00:19:14,079
You just let him in.

397
00:19:20,319 --> 00:19:20,999
Hello, Mrs. Feng.

398
00:19:24,920 --> 00:19:26,279
How did you get an elevator card?

399
00:19:26,719 --> 00:19:27,719
Feng Meiqi gave it to me.

400
00:19:37,640 --> 00:19:38,400
Feng Meiqi.

401
00:19:40,960 --> 00:19:43,200
Did you give Shen Minghui
that elevator card?

402
00:19:43,920 --> 00:19:44,920
Elevator card?

403
00:19:44,999 --> 00:19:45,519
Yes.

404
00:19:45,620 --> 00:19:47,040
I didn't give him any elevator card.

405
00:19:47,050 --> 00:19:47,920
How's that possible?

406
00:19:47,920 --> 00:19:49,079
He said it was from you.

407
00:19:51,880 --> 00:19:53,519
I was wondering where mine went.

408
00:19:53,519 --> 00:19:56,759
That kid's just making things up again.

409
00:19:59,799 --> 00:20:00,680
Where are you going?

410
00:20:01,200 --> 00:20:02,060
None of your business.

411
00:20:10,279 --> 00:20:12,039
No one's been
bothering you lately, right?

412
00:20:12,039 --> 00:20:12,719
Don't worry.

413
00:20:13,120 --> 00:20:15,120
I'm here. No one would dare.

414
00:20:15,440 --> 00:20:16,840
Don't get me into trouble.

415
00:20:17,039 --> 00:20:17,759
Got it.

416
00:20:17,920 --> 00:20:19,600
Here, let me get you some more.

417
00:20:23,130 --> 00:20:23,920
Does it taste good?

418
00:20:24,200 --> 00:20:25,319
Yes, you made it?

419
00:20:26,840 --> 00:20:28,999
Liar, it must have been Dad.

420
00:20:29,279 --> 00:20:29,799
Come on.

421
00:20:30,519 --> 00:20:31,319
Same thing.

422
00:20:32,279 --> 00:20:33,750
Mine tastes better than Dad's anyway.

423
00:21:16,600 --> 00:21:17,440
Shen Minghui.

424
00:21:18,600 --> 00:21:19,680
Why are you still here?

425
00:21:19,840 --> 00:21:21,279
Where else would I go?

426
00:21:22,840 --> 00:21:23,920
I'm not going anywhere.

427
00:21:24,960 --> 00:21:26,799
Wherever my sister lives, I live too.

428
00:21:27,999 --> 00:21:28,840
This card's broken.

429
00:21:29,200 --> 00:21:30,450
You'll have to take me upstairs.

430
00:21:31,300 --> 00:21:32,519
Your sister's resting upstairs.

431
00:21:32,519 --> 00:21:33,479
Don't disturb her.

432
00:21:33,759 --> 00:21:34,479
Fine.

433
00:21:35,079 --> 00:21:36,279
When she wakes up,

434
00:21:36,840 --> 00:21:38,279
I'll take her home with me.

435
00:21:39,840 --> 00:21:41,239
Stop being unreasonable, alright?

436
00:21:41,239 --> 00:21:42,600
Who's being unreasonable?

437
00:21:43,039 --> 00:21:44,440
Do you even know what this is?

438
00:21:44,999 --> 00:21:46,239
It's basically house arrest.

439
00:21:46,479 --> 00:21:47,600
My sister may be easygoing,

440
00:21:47,960 --> 00:21:48,999
but I'm not.

441
00:21:49,799 --> 00:21:51,799
If you keep treating
my family like strangers,

442
00:21:52,200 --> 00:21:53,559
I might not be good at much,

443
00:21:53,559 --> 00:21:55,319
but I can sure make your house restless.

444
00:21:58,170 --> 00:21:59,200
What are you trying to do?

445
00:22:00,799 --> 00:22:01,479
Get a card.

446
00:22:23,079 --> 00:22:23,880
Ms. Shen.

447
00:22:24,559 --> 00:22:25,440
Hello.

448
00:22:26,279 --> 00:22:28,440
I have some good news for you.

449
00:22:28,600 --> 00:22:31,360
Jiao won second place
in her piano competition today.

450
00:22:31,680 --> 00:22:33,160
Thanks to your guidance.

451
00:22:33,759 --> 00:22:34,360
Not at all.

452
00:22:34,880 --> 00:22:36,799
She's naturally gifted.

453
00:22:39,680 --> 00:22:41,360
Ms. Shen, you look

454
00:22:41,360 --> 00:22:43,160
a bit pale.

455
00:22:43,799 --> 00:22:44,920
Haven't been resting well?

456
00:22:46,640 --> 00:22:47,719
I'm pregnant.

457
00:22:48,239 --> 00:22:49,519
What a coincidence.

458
00:22:50,519 --> 00:22:51,680
I'm pregnant too.

459
00:22:52,440 --> 00:22:53,559
It's my second child.

460
00:22:54,719 --> 00:22:55,920
I haven't been

461
00:22:56,039 --> 00:22:56,880
sleeping well either.

462
00:22:56,880 --> 00:22:58,160
Can't eat much either.

463
00:22:59,360 --> 00:22:59,999
Oh right.

464
00:23:00,319 --> 00:23:02,120
You should register
at the People's Hospital.

465
00:23:02,120 --> 00:23:03,719
Ask for Dr. Li Jingzhe.

466
00:23:03,880 --> 00:23:05,440
He's young,

467
00:23:05,440 --> 00:23:06,799
and yes, a male doctor,

468
00:23:06,799 --> 00:23:07,400
but still,

469
00:23:07,799 --> 00:23:09,160
he's very professional.

470
00:23:09,160 --> 00:23:11,279
I'm seeing Dr. Li as well.

471
00:23:12,400 --> 00:23:14,479
That's such a coincidence.

472
00:23:15,840 --> 00:23:16,719
Ms. Shen.

473
00:23:17,960 --> 00:23:19,759
Don't you think we were

474
00:23:20,680 --> 00:23:21,960
meant to meet?

475
00:23:24,120 --> 00:23:25,640
How about this?

476
00:23:25,759 --> 00:23:27,360
Since we both see Dr. Li Jingzhe

477
00:23:27,360 --> 00:23:28,360
at the People's Hospital,

478
00:23:28,360 --> 00:23:30,920
why don't we go for checkups together

479
00:23:30,920 --> 00:23:31,519
next time?

480
00:23:33,239 --> 00:23:33,799
Alright.

481
00:23:34,600 --> 00:23:35,120
Sounds good.

482
00:23:35,759 --> 00:23:37,239
Then I won't keep you any longer.

483
00:23:39,719 --> 00:23:40,360
Bye.

484
00:23:44,440 --> 00:23:45,120
Zhidong.

485
00:23:46,160 --> 00:23:47,160
Zhidong.

486
00:23:48,200 --> 00:23:49,519
Bring me another jar.

487
00:23:49,999 --> 00:23:50,960
Where is it?

488
00:23:51,440 --> 00:23:52,920
Under the cabinet.

489
00:23:57,660 --> 00:23:58,920
How many times have I said this?

490
00:23:58,920 --> 00:24:00,719
Make something I can take to work.

491
00:24:01,319 --> 00:24:02,440
You always ignore me.

492
00:24:05,559 --> 00:24:06,600
It's not the same.

493
00:24:07,680 --> 00:24:09,279
Your second sister is pregnant.

494
00:24:09,719 --> 00:24:10,759
And now you are too?

495
00:24:10,759 --> 00:24:11,239
You're spoiled.

496
00:24:11,239 --> 00:24:13,759
When I was pregnant,
I didn't get this treatment.

497
00:24:14,400 --> 00:24:15,519
Zhixia's here.

498
00:24:16,799 --> 00:24:18,960
Zhang Hao's office gave out grapes,
they're very sweet.

499
00:24:19,160 --> 00:24:20,079
I'll wash them.

500
00:24:20,759 --> 00:24:23,600
My eldest girl
is always the most thoughtful.

501
00:24:27,559 --> 00:24:28,279
Zhixia.

502
00:24:29,719 --> 00:24:32,680
I've thought about it over and over.

503
00:24:33,039 --> 00:24:35,079
That baby cannot be kept.

504
00:24:38,960 --> 00:24:39,840
I mean,

505
00:24:39,840 --> 00:24:41,799
Zhilu's baby cannot be kept.

506
00:24:43,400 --> 00:24:45,120
Zhilu is still young.

507
00:24:45,120 --> 00:24:47,160
How will she
ever find someone in the future?

508
00:24:47,840 --> 00:24:48,519
Right?

509
00:24:49,279 --> 00:24:51,519
And a child growing up without a father

510
00:24:51,519 --> 00:24:52,400
is such a pity.

511
00:24:53,350 --> 00:24:54,799
Mom, that's not really your business.

512
00:24:56,200 --> 00:24:57,400
Why not?

513
00:24:58,440 --> 00:25:00,239
Zhilu is my daughter.

514
00:25:00,319 --> 00:25:02,239
It's only right for me
to care about her.

515
00:25:02,719 --> 00:25:04,360
She's still young.

516
00:25:04,360 --> 00:25:05,799
Her life has just begun.

517
00:25:05,799 --> 00:25:07,200
If she raises a child alone now...

518
00:25:07,319 --> 00:25:08,719
Mom, her name isn't Zhilu.

519
00:25:08,719 --> 00:25:10,039
It's Shen Mingzhu.

520
00:25:12,150 --> 00:25:13,039
Whatever you call her.

521
00:25:13,039 --> 00:25:14,319
That's not important.

522
00:25:14,440 --> 00:25:15,120
Anyway,

523
00:25:15,120 --> 00:25:16,360
what I mean is,

524
00:25:16,360 --> 00:25:18,039
given her situation right now,

525
00:25:19,279 --> 00:25:19,920
right?

526
00:25:20,440 --> 00:25:22,920
Someone needs to talk to her
and help her decide.

527
00:25:26,759 --> 00:25:27,920
I think,

528
00:25:29,079 --> 00:25:29,719
Zhixia,

529
00:25:30,519 --> 00:25:32,120
you should talk to her.

530
00:25:32,200 --> 00:25:33,799
Try to make her understand, alright?

531
00:25:35,559 --> 00:25:37,479
Mom, let me repeat this.

532
00:25:39,039 --> 00:25:40,079
Her name isn't Zhilu.

533
00:25:40,360 --> 00:25:41,479
It's Shen Mingzhu.

534
00:25:42,079 --> 00:25:43,160
She has her own parents,

535
00:25:43,160 --> 00:25:44,039
her own brother,

536
00:25:44,039 --> 00:25:45,079
and her own life.

537
00:25:45,360 --> 00:25:47,920
What position am I in,

538
00:25:47,920 --> 00:25:49,680
what right do I have,

539
00:25:49,880 --> 00:25:51,680
to interfere in her life?

540
00:25:54,960 --> 00:25:55,519
Zhixia.

541
00:25:55,560 --> 00:25:56,759
These grapes are really sweet.

542
00:25:58,799 --> 00:25:59,360
She...

543
00:26:08,680 --> 00:26:09,559
Here, take this.

544
00:26:10,319 --> 00:26:10,920
This one.

545
00:26:11,960 --> 00:26:12,860
Give it to your sister.

546
00:26:13,360 --> 00:26:14,279
This one's for you.

547
00:26:14,279 --> 00:26:14,920
Thanks, Mom.

548
00:26:14,920 --> 00:26:15,559
Zhilu.

549
00:26:17,880 --> 00:26:19,640
Mom, I just started
talking to her again.

550
00:26:19,640 --> 00:26:21,840
If I give it to her now,
do you think she'd even eat it?

551
00:26:22,319 --> 00:26:22,759
She…

552
00:26:23,519 --> 00:26:24,160
Zhixia.

553
00:26:24,999 --> 00:26:26,559
Why don't you use a delivery service?

554
00:26:27,039 --> 00:26:28,759
Send it under Jiao's name.

555
00:26:28,759 --> 00:26:29,950
Wouldn't that mean she has to…

556
00:26:32,400 --> 00:26:33,759
Son, that's a good idea.

557
00:26:33,840 --> 00:26:34,759
Use Jiao's name.

558
00:26:34,759 --> 00:26:35,440
That's clever.

559
00:26:35,440 --> 00:26:37,060
Let your son deliver it, not my concern.

560
00:26:39,479 --> 00:26:40,920
What does it have to do with me?

561
00:27:11,960 --> 00:27:12,799
Zhixia.

562
00:27:13,079 --> 00:27:14,960
I received the pickled mustard you sent.

563
00:27:15,279 --> 00:27:16,719
Please thank your mother for me.

564
00:27:16,719 --> 00:27:17,710
That was very thoughtful.

565
00:27:22,960 --> 00:27:23,640
Mingzhu.

566
00:27:23,719 --> 00:27:24,319
Mrs. Feng.

567
00:27:25,759 --> 00:27:26,719
What's that smell?

568
00:27:27,680 --> 00:27:28,999
A friend sent me this.

569
00:27:28,999 --> 00:27:30,079
It's pickled mustard.

570
00:27:30,079 --> 00:27:31,600
Her mother made it herself.

571
00:27:31,999 --> 00:27:33,160
Mingzhu,

572
00:27:33,279 --> 00:27:34,279
this kind of food

573
00:27:34,279 --> 00:27:36,799
should never enter our home.

574
00:27:37,239 --> 00:27:39,640
It contains a lot of nitrites.

575
00:27:39,640 --> 00:27:41,680
It's not good for your health at all.

576
00:27:41,799 --> 00:27:43,559
Who sent it? What kind of friend?

577
00:27:43,920 --> 00:27:44,880
What was she thinking?

578
00:27:44,880 --> 00:27:46,559
Doesn't she know you're pregnant?

579
00:27:47,360 --> 00:27:48,559
No, you can't eat that.

580
00:27:48,559 --> 00:27:49,559
Throw it away.

581
00:27:50,039 --> 00:27:50,600
But…

582
00:27:50,860 --> 00:27:52,920
It's fine if I just have
a little once in a while.

583
00:27:52,920 --> 00:27:53,719
Absolutely not.

584
00:27:55,279 --> 00:27:55,920
This.

585
00:28:02,640 --> 00:28:03,440
You're welcome.

586
00:28:03,520 --> 00:28:04,759
Let me know when you finish it.

587
00:28:04,759 --> 00:28:05,920
I'll ask my Mom to make more.

588
00:28:08,039 --> 00:28:08,799
Mingzhu,

589
00:28:08,799 --> 00:28:10,200
you're pregnant now.

590
00:28:10,200 --> 00:28:11,559
Stop using your phone so much.

591
00:28:11,559 --> 00:28:13,360
The radiation is strong.

592
00:28:13,360 --> 00:28:15,120
It's bad for the baby's health.

593
00:28:15,640 --> 00:28:17,319
I'll hold on to your phone for you.

594
00:28:17,519 --> 00:28:18,960
I'll call you if someone phones.

595
00:28:21,920 --> 00:28:22,600
Also,

596
00:28:22,600 --> 00:28:25,400
I made this tremella soup
especially for you.

597
00:28:25,400 --> 00:28:27,960
I even asked Madam Mao
to add donkey-hide gelatin.

598
00:28:27,960 --> 00:28:28,999
It's very nutritious.

599
00:28:28,999 --> 00:28:29,920
Go ahead, eat it.

600
00:28:30,360 --> 00:28:31,239
Thank you, Mrs. Feng.

601
00:28:32,400 --> 00:28:33,239
Eat it.

602
00:28:34,160 --> 00:28:34,799
Oh, right.

603
00:28:36,079 --> 00:28:37,239
I'm taking this with me.

604
00:28:41,799 --> 00:28:42,559
Ms. Mao.

605
00:28:46,999 --> 00:28:47,640
Coming.

606
00:28:48,160 --> 00:28:49,279
Throw this away.

607
00:28:49,880 --> 00:28:52,200
She really take everything home.

608
00:28:53,400 --> 00:28:54,039
Sister.

609
00:28:55,440 --> 00:28:56,279
Liya's here.

610
00:28:56,279 --> 00:28:58,279
I brought
some sea cucumbers for Mingzhu.

611
00:28:58,279 --> 00:29:00,079
Wild ones, one-hundred-head grade.

612
00:29:00,200 --> 00:29:00,640
Nice.

613
00:29:00,640 --> 00:29:01,950
Thanks. Great for a pregnant woman.

614
00:29:02,519 --> 00:29:03,559
- Ms. Mao.
- I'm worn out.

615
00:29:03,920 --> 00:29:04,440
Coming.

616
00:29:04,440 --> 00:29:05,160
Come in.

617
00:29:05,160 --> 00:29:06,200
Take this over there.

618
00:29:06,319 --> 00:29:07,680
Start with twenty.

619
00:29:08,600 --> 00:29:09,079
Alright.

620
00:29:09,079 --> 00:29:10,279
Pour Liya some tea.

621
00:29:10,360 --> 00:29:10,920
Okay.

622
00:29:12,239 --> 00:29:13,559
- Thanks.
- You look good.

623
00:29:14,759 --> 00:29:15,680
No need to thank me.

624
00:29:16,279 --> 00:29:16,840
Sister.

625
00:29:17,880 --> 00:29:18,680
How's it going?

626
00:29:19,039 --> 00:29:20,319
Has Mingzhu decided

627
00:29:20,319 --> 00:29:21,640
to keep the baby?

628
00:29:22,120 --> 00:29:24,200
No. She hasn't said anything yet.

629
00:29:26,440 --> 00:29:27,600
Cornual pregnancy.

630
00:29:27,880 --> 00:29:29,880
The baby might not make it.

631
00:29:31,360 --> 00:29:32,479
That's just an excuse.

632
00:29:33,039 --> 00:29:35,160
She wants you to transfer the flat

633
00:29:35,160 --> 00:29:36,640
to her name first.

634
00:29:37,479 --> 00:29:38,200
Why would she?

635
00:29:39,600 --> 00:29:41,680
People like that never act for free.

636
00:29:41,680 --> 00:29:43,039
They always play tricks.

637
00:29:43,719 --> 00:29:44,519
If that's true,

638
00:29:44,519 --> 00:29:46,880
then it's simple.

639
00:29:47,160 --> 00:29:49,799
Just transfer it to Mingzhu.

640
00:29:49,799 --> 00:29:51,079
After all,

641
00:29:51,079 --> 00:29:52,799
it's for her and the baby anyway.

642
00:29:54,440 --> 00:29:55,880
Before you do that,

643
00:29:55,880 --> 00:29:58,799
let her take a paternity test.

644
00:29:58,880 --> 00:29:59,600
Why?

645
00:30:00,640 --> 00:30:02,039
Young people are careless now.

646
00:30:02,039 --> 00:30:03,840
What if it's not Jianqi's child?

647
00:30:03,920 --> 00:30:04,920
Don't get it wrong.

648
00:30:04,920 --> 00:30:05,880
Don't talk nonsense.

649
00:30:05,999 --> 00:30:07,920
It's definitely Jianqi's baby.

650
00:30:07,920 --> 00:30:09,039
What's the big deal?

651
00:30:09,239 --> 00:30:11,519
Just follow procedure. Right?

652
00:30:11,519 --> 00:30:12,640
Do a paternity test.

653
00:30:13,120 --> 00:30:14,799
Have the baby, transfer the flat.

654
00:30:14,799 --> 00:30:15,920
That's how it should be.

655
00:30:15,920 --> 00:30:17,039
What are you talking about?

656
00:30:17,039 --> 00:30:19,160
You're confusing me completely.

657
00:30:19,160 --> 00:30:19,920
That's impossible.

658
00:30:19,920 --> 00:30:21,519
I'm telling you, stop saying nonsense.

659
00:30:21,519 --> 00:30:23,120
The baby is Jianqi's.

660
00:30:23,120 --> 00:30:24,519
I trust Mingzhu.

661
00:30:24,799 --> 00:30:27,559
- This is about a person's character.
- Don't talk nonsense.

662
00:30:27,559 --> 00:30:29,600
I'm just saying,
better be safe than sorry.

663
00:30:29,600 --> 00:30:30,360
You never know.

664
00:30:30,360 --> 00:30:32,239
Stop it already, you're too much.

665
00:30:34,400 --> 00:30:35,200
Mingzhu.

666
00:30:36,039 --> 00:30:36,640
I...

667
00:30:37,400 --> 00:30:40,200
I just need to follow procedure, right?

668
00:30:40,200 --> 00:30:42,559
The flat is really meant to be yours.

669
00:30:42,559 --> 00:30:43,550
Isn't that right, sister?

670
00:30:43,880 --> 00:30:44,559
Mingzhu.

671
00:30:44,559 --> 00:30:45,650
Don't take it the wrong way.

672
00:30:45,799 --> 00:30:46,799
I didn't.

673
00:30:57,440 --> 00:30:58,160
Mrs. Feng.

674
00:30:58,920 --> 00:31:00,039
Give me my phone.

675
00:31:00,360 --> 00:31:01,600
I need some air.

676
00:31:01,799 --> 00:31:02,680
Sure, sure.

677
00:31:02,680 --> 00:31:03,960
Go downstairs for a walk.

678
00:31:03,960 --> 00:31:05,160
It's good for the baby.

679
00:31:05,600 --> 00:31:07,799
Mingzhu, phones have too much radiation.

680
00:31:07,799 --> 00:31:08,840
It's not good for the baby.

681
00:31:08,840 --> 00:31:10,479
If I'm afraid of radiation,

682
00:31:11,039 --> 00:31:13,120
how can I be a single mother?

683
00:31:29,479 --> 00:31:30,440
Take it slow.

684
00:31:36,840 --> 00:31:37,519
Mingzhu.

685
00:31:41,600 --> 00:31:42,319
Mingzhu.

686
00:31:43,120 --> 00:31:43,799
Mingzhu.

687
00:31:44,350 --> 00:31:45,120
Where are you going?

688
00:31:45,120 --> 00:31:46,120
I'll walk with you.

689
00:31:46,719 --> 00:31:48,440
No need. I want to be alone.

690
00:31:48,719 --> 00:31:49,840
You're pregnant.

691
00:31:49,840 --> 00:31:50,600
It's not safe alone.

692
00:31:50,600 --> 00:31:52,279
We'll worry, won't we?

693
00:31:52,479 --> 00:31:53,079
Auntie.

694
00:31:53,680 --> 00:31:54,880
If someone watched you all day,

695
00:31:54,880 --> 00:31:55,940
would you feel comfortable?

696
00:31:55,960 --> 00:31:57,799
I'm not watching you.

697
00:31:57,799 --> 00:31:58,840
I'm just worried about you.

698
00:31:58,840 --> 00:31:59,680
Worried about me,

699
00:31:59,920 --> 00:32:01,680
or about the baby inside me?

700
00:32:01,960 --> 00:32:03,039
If it weren't for this baby,

701
00:32:03,039 --> 00:32:04,600
would we even be in touch now?

702
00:32:05,079 --> 00:32:06,960
Watch your mouth, young lady.

703
00:32:07,160 --> 00:32:08,440
Don't be so rude.

704
00:32:08,519 --> 00:32:10,279
What's right and what's rude?

705
00:32:10,360 --> 00:32:11,120
Who are you?

706
00:32:11,880 --> 00:32:13,160
I'm Mingzhu's friend.

707
00:32:13,170 --> 00:32:14,640
An expert in telling right from wrong.

708
00:32:15,239 --> 00:32:17,640
Being kind and respectful is right.

709
00:32:17,960 --> 00:32:19,880
Pretending to care while trying

710
00:32:19,880 --> 00:32:20,759
to control someone,

711
00:32:20,880 --> 00:32:22,120
that's plain wrong.

712
00:32:22,759 --> 00:32:23,680
Mingzhu, get in the car.

713
00:32:25,519 --> 00:32:26,519
Don't worry, Auntie.

714
00:32:26,719 --> 00:32:27,960
I'll take good care of myself.

715
00:32:31,640 --> 00:32:32,319
Sit tight.

716
00:32:33,479 --> 00:32:34,559
Be careful.

717
00:32:34,559 --> 00:32:35,239
We're off.

718
00:32:49,440 --> 00:32:50,200
Where's Mingzhu?

719
00:32:50,640 --> 00:32:51,880
She went out with her friend.

720
00:32:51,880 --> 00:32:52,600
Where to?

721
00:32:52,719 --> 00:32:53,559
How would I know?

722
00:32:54,559 --> 00:32:55,160
Sister.

723
00:32:55,160 --> 00:32:56,799
Your daughter-in-law is something else.

724
00:32:56,799 --> 00:32:58,120
You can't control her.

725
00:32:59,319 --> 00:33:00,799
Don't give her that flat so easily.

726
00:33:01,440 --> 00:33:02,360
Did you hear me?

727
00:33:07,600 --> 00:33:08,479
Goodness.

728
00:33:08,479 --> 00:33:10,239
You've got a queen living in your house.

729
00:33:10,920 --> 00:33:12,479
Having a baby is a serious matter.

730
00:33:12,640 --> 00:33:14,079
Exactly. Once the baby's born,

731
00:33:14,680 --> 00:33:15,840
there's no father.

732
00:33:16,319 --> 00:33:17,719
And I'll be tied to that family

733
00:33:17,719 --> 00:33:18,920
for the rest of my life.

734
00:33:19,759 --> 00:33:21,440
Would that really be good for the baby?

735
00:33:22,039 --> 00:33:22,960
When I was little,

736
00:33:22,960 --> 00:33:25,279
my parents fought
all the time and nearly divorced.

737
00:33:25,519 --> 00:33:27,120
Sometimes I didn't even get to eat.

738
00:33:27,360 --> 00:33:28,640
I hated it so much.

739
00:33:28,640 --> 00:33:30,279
I wondered why they even had me.

740
00:33:30,640 --> 00:33:31,960
But now I've grown up.

741
00:33:31,960 --> 00:33:33,479
I run my own shop and make money.

742
00:33:34,600 --> 00:33:35,759
I go wherever I want.

743
00:33:36,039 --> 00:33:37,120
I do whatever I want.

744
00:33:37,440 --> 00:33:38,840
I don't need to please anyone.

745
00:33:39,239 --> 00:33:41,440
Now I think it's not so bad

746
00:33:41,719 --> 00:33:42,400
to be alive.

747
00:33:42,410 --> 00:33:44,039
I'm glad
they brought me into this world.

748
00:33:46,279 --> 00:33:46,960
Ni.

749
00:33:48,120 --> 00:33:50,519
If I don't rely on his family,

750
00:33:51,120 --> 00:33:52,440
and raise the baby on my own,

751
00:33:52,799 --> 00:33:54,440
can I really do it?

752
00:33:56,039 --> 00:33:57,710
That depends on
how you plan to raise him.

753
00:33:57,759 --> 00:34:00,239
Will it be breastfeeding,
wearing Xiaoni's old clothes,

754
00:34:00,519 --> 00:34:03,200
or imported formula
and designer outfits?

755
00:34:03,519 --> 00:34:04,880
Either way, he'll grow up fine.

756
00:34:05,039 --> 00:34:06,680
You know that's not what I meant.

757
00:34:07,759 --> 00:34:08,600
Get to the point.

758
00:34:09,719 --> 00:34:11,360
Alright, here's the point.

759
00:34:12,840 --> 00:34:14,920
I know you truly loved Jianqi.

760
00:34:14,920 --> 00:34:16,279
You both really loved each other.

761
00:34:16,400 --> 00:34:17,559
That's why deep down,

762
00:34:17,559 --> 00:34:18,800
you want to keep his child,

763
00:34:18,800 --> 00:34:20,079
to continue that love.

764
00:34:20,240 --> 00:34:21,119
But listen,

765
00:34:21,119 --> 00:34:21,960
being pregnant

766
00:34:21,960 --> 00:34:23,599
starts with love,

767
00:34:24,159 --> 00:34:26,479
but now it's no longer about love.

768
00:34:27,039 --> 00:34:28,960
You have to face reality.

769
00:34:29,920 --> 00:34:31,880
Do you really want to have this baby?

770
00:34:32,119 --> 00:34:33,840
Why do you want to have this baby?

771
00:34:34,280 --> 00:34:35,400
Do you have the means

772
00:34:35,400 --> 00:34:36,960
to give him a good life

773
00:34:36,960 --> 00:34:37,840
and education?

774
00:34:38,079 --> 00:34:39,320
Are you mature enough

775
00:34:39,320 --> 00:34:40,800
to be a good mother?

776
00:34:41,400 --> 00:34:43,519
Forget what anyone else says.

777
00:34:43,920 --> 00:34:45,559
It may look like a family matter,

778
00:34:45,559 --> 00:34:46,400
a group matter,

779
00:34:46,400 --> 00:34:47,079
but in the end,

780
00:34:47,079 --> 00:34:48,920
it's only your decision.

781
00:34:49,800 --> 00:34:51,039
Life isn't a textbook.

782
00:34:51,039 --> 00:34:51,999
There's no right answer.

783
00:34:52,559 --> 00:34:54,280
You have to decide for yourself.

784
00:34:55,079 --> 00:34:56,360
No one can force you

785
00:34:56,360 --> 00:34:57,400
to have this baby.

786
00:34:58,240 --> 00:34:59,400
And no one can stop you

787
00:34:59,400 --> 00:35:00,360
from having this baby.

788
00:35:21,240 --> 00:35:22,159
Hold that for me.

789
00:35:22,160 --> 00:35:24,199
Dad, do you still need
to press it down if it's non-slip?

790
00:35:24,199 --> 00:35:24,920
Well, you see...

791
00:35:24,920 --> 00:35:26,320
The non-slip part's on top.

792
00:35:26,440 --> 00:35:27,440
What about underneath?

793
00:35:27,440 --> 00:35:28,199
You handle it.

794
00:35:28,679 --> 00:35:29,960
Line it up with the seam.

795
00:35:29,960 --> 00:35:30,559
Which one?

796
00:35:30,960 --> 00:35:31,800
The floor seam.

797
00:35:31,880 --> 00:35:32,440
Got it.

798
00:35:34,320 --> 00:35:34,960
Good.

799
00:35:40,240 --> 00:35:42,360
This cotton's freshly fluffed.
It's so warm.

800
00:35:45,159 --> 00:35:47,039
I told you to buy one that fits.

801
00:35:47,039 --> 00:35:47,679
But no,

802
00:35:48,360 --> 00:35:50,199
you had to bring it back
and make it yourself.

803
00:35:50,199 --> 00:35:51,039
Such trouble.

804
00:35:51,800 --> 00:35:53,360
You always talk like that.

805
00:35:53,840 --> 00:35:55,440
How could anything fit you better?

806
00:35:55,519 --> 00:35:56,760
It's just right.

807
00:35:57,159 --> 00:35:59,320
You always
make the best use of everything.

808
00:36:00,280 --> 00:36:01,360
This side isn't slippery.

809
00:36:01,520 --> 00:36:02,920
Do you need to cover that side too?

810
00:36:03,720 --> 00:36:04,920
No need, Dad.

811
00:36:06,039 --> 00:36:07,479
Does she get out of bed from here?

812
00:36:07,479 --> 00:36:08,720
Then I'll just cut from here.

813
00:36:09,039 --> 00:36:09,920
Alright.

814
00:36:10,240 --> 00:36:10,760
Okay.

815
00:36:10,760 --> 00:36:11,360
Mom.

816
00:36:13,039 --> 00:36:14,260
Did you give it to your sister?

817
00:36:14,840 --> 00:36:15,400
Yes.

818
00:36:15,999 --> 00:36:17,070
Did you give it to her yet?

819
00:36:17,080 --> 00:36:18,490
- I'll give it later.
- It will be like this.

820
00:36:19,720 --> 00:36:20,840
It's not slippery at all now.

821
00:36:21,079 --> 00:36:21,639
Let's go.

822
00:36:21,660 --> 00:36:23,440
Get up. Why are you
wearing shoes on the mat?

823
00:36:23,840 --> 00:36:24,999
It's a non-slip mat.

824
00:36:25,860 --> 00:36:27,039
You don't need it over there.

825
00:36:27,199 --> 00:36:28,360
Mingzhu, have an orange.

826
00:36:31,320 --> 00:36:32,039
It's all for you.

827
00:36:33,559 --> 00:36:34,280
We're heading out.

828
00:36:37,479 --> 00:36:39,440
That's better. Not slippery anymore.

829
00:36:42,559 --> 00:36:43,199
Mom.

830
00:36:43,800 --> 00:36:44,519
What is it?

831
00:36:44,840 --> 00:36:46,920
Can you sleep with me tonight?

832
00:36:47,920 --> 00:36:48,559
Of course.

833
00:36:59,880 --> 00:37:01,280
Just like when you were little.

834
00:37:03,039 --> 00:37:05,320
You always held my hand to sleep.

835
00:37:08,639 --> 00:37:10,840
Sometimes I thought you were asleep.

836
00:37:11,320 --> 00:37:12,599
I'd pull my hand away.

837
00:37:12,599 --> 00:37:14,760
Then you'd mumble, "Mom,

838
00:37:14,760 --> 00:37:15,479
hand."

839
00:37:18,360 --> 00:37:19,039
Mom.

840
00:37:20,800 --> 00:37:22,679
Why are you so good to me?

841
00:37:23,999 --> 00:37:26,760
Silly girl, I'm your mom.

842
00:37:28,159 --> 00:37:30,559
Didn't you and Dad adopt me?

843
00:37:32,800 --> 00:37:35,039
Love means more than blood, my child.

844
00:37:35,999 --> 00:37:37,039
Look at Ni's mom.

845
00:37:39,559 --> 00:37:40,559
The way she treats her cat.

846
00:37:42,159 --> 00:37:43,240
She's always holding it,

847
00:37:43,240 --> 00:37:44,679
and feeding it too.

848
00:37:45,800 --> 00:37:47,880
Was that cat born to her?

849
00:37:53,400 --> 00:37:54,320
Sometimes,

850
00:37:54,479 --> 00:37:56,199
when we're having dinner,

851
00:37:57,840 --> 00:37:59,400
I look at you and Minghui.

852
00:38:00,159 --> 00:38:02,199
You poke at the food here,
grab at it there.

853
00:38:02,199 --> 00:38:04,039
You two fight over bites.

854
00:38:04,800 --> 00:38:06,840
It makes me so happy.

855
00:38:07,920 --> 00:38:09,679
I feel my life

856
00:38:10,720 --> 00:38:11,840
is already complete.

857
00:38:11,840 --> 00:38:13,800
I just feel so happy.

858
00:38:16,159 --> 00:38:18,240
No matter how hard it's been,
it's all been worth it.

859
00:38:20,039 --> 00:38:21,479
You and Dad treat me so well.

860
00:38:22,199 --> 00:38:23,240
Minghui gets jealous.

861
00:38:23,880 --> 00:38:25,800
He grabs whatever I take.

862
00:38:26,039 --> 00:38:27,479
If I'd known he'd be this naughty,

863
00:38:27,479 --> 00:38:28,750
I'd have stopped him being born.

864
00:38:29,679 --> 00:38:31,240
Watch your mouth.

865
00:38:36,920 --> 00:38:37,559
Sweetheart.

866
00:38:39,760 --> 00:38:40,440
That...

867
00:38:42,800 --> 00:38:45,320
Your dad told me not to nag. He said,

868
00:38:46,840 --> 00:38:47,999
whether to keep the baby

869
00:38:47,999 --> 00:38:49,039
is up to you.

870
00:38:50,360 --> 00:38:52,280
But I just want to tell you this.

871
00:38:55,240 --> 00:38:57,760
Forget whether
the Feng family has money,

872
00:38:58,119 --> 00:39:00,840
or whether they'll help later.

873
00:39:02,159 --> 00:39:03,840
As long as you decide to keep it,

874
00:39:04,840 --> 00:39:06,039
I'll help you raise it.

875
00:39:08,800 --> 00:39:09,920
I will help too.

876
00:39:11,159 --> 00:39:12,960
Shen Minghui, go to bed right now.

877
00:39:15,960 --> 00:39:16,840
No rush.

878
00:39:17,720 --> 00:39:19,760
Take your time.
There's still time to think.

879
00:39:51,240 --> 00:39:52,920
What's all the fuss this early?

880
00:39:53,690 --> 00:39:55,240
Didn't you say Mingzhu's going to work?

881
00:39:55,240 --> 00:39:56,950
I'm cooking her
a couple of dishes to take.

882
00:40:09,700 --> 00:40:11,159
The number of occupied rooms each day

883
00:40:11,159 --> 00:40:12,840
must be checked again and again.

884
00:40:13,119 --> 00:40:14,760
There can't be any mistakes.

885
00:40:15,880 --> 00:40:16,320
This one...

886
00:40:16,320 --> 00:40:17,159
Mingzhu.

887
00:40:17,920 --> 00:40:18,800
Mingzhu.

888
00:40:18,999 --> 00:40:19,679
Why are you here?

889
00:40:19,679 --> 00:40:20,570
- Mr. Zhao.
- Mingzhu.

890
00:40:20,960 --> 00:40:21,940
What are you doing here?

891
00:40:22,280 --> 00:40:23,280
I'm here for work.

892
00:40:24,039 --> 00:40:25,280
Nonsense. Work?

893
00:40:25,280 --> 00:40:26,519
You're pregnant now.

894
00:40:26,559 --> 00:40:28,559
And with everything
that's happened at home,

895
00:40:29,880 --> 00:40:30,960
take another month off.

896
00:40:30,960 --> 00:40:31,999
Go home and rest.

897
00:40:32,519 --> 00:40:33,280
A month?

898
00:40:33,599 --> 00:40:34,559
What about it?

899
00:40:35,479 --> 00:40:38,039
Will that be personal leave
or sick leave?

900
00:40:38,519 --> 00:40:40,159
Do I need to bring a doctor's note?

901
00:40:40,159 --> 00:40:41,199
No need.

902
00:40:41,559 --> 00:40:42,559
No matter what,

903
00:40:42,840 --> 00:40:43,800
our team here

904
00:40:43,800 --> 00:40:45,479
still stands for loyalty and care.

905
00:40:45,840 --> 00:40:48,960
And don't forget, your father-in-law
has always looked after us.

906
00:40:49,679 --> 00:40:51,199
Alright, go home and rest.

907
00:40:51,880 --> 00:40:52,960
Eat well and sleep well.

908
00:40:52,960 --> 00:40:54,680
That's the most important job
you have now.

909
00:40:55,159 --> 00:40:55,760
Go on.

910
00:40:57,370 --> 00:40:58,559
I'll head off then, Mr. Zhao.

911
00:40:58,679 --> 00:40:59,639
Go on.

912
00:41:02,479 --> 00:41:03,800
She's pregnant now.

913
00:41:03,800 --> 00:41:05,079
You're both busy running the business.

914
00:41:05,079 --> 00:41:06,390
No one's there to look after her.

915
00:41:06,519 --> 00:41:07,679
I can't help worrying.

916
00:41:07,800 --> 00:41:08,960
She has to come back home.

917
00:41:09,559 --> 00:41:10,679
No.

918
00:41:10,800 --> 00:41:11,999
I'll call her first.

919
00:41:14,360 --> 00:41:15,400
Look at that.

920
00:41:15,840 --> 00:41:17,280
She's not even their own child...

921
00:41:17,360 --> 00:41:17,880
Enough.

922
00:41:18,720 --> 00:41:20,039
I'm heading to the office.

923
00:41:21,159 --> 00:41:21,679
Feng.

924
00:41:21,679 --> 00:41:23,199
Everything's in chaos now.

925
00:41:23,199 --> 00:41:24,159
Why aren't you doing anything?

926
00:41:24,159 --> 00:41:26,199
You're always running off somewhere.

927
00:41:27,559 --> 00:41:28,559
Really...

928
00:41:33,519 --> 00:41:34,320
Sorry.

929
00:41:34,320 --> 00:41:36,559
The number
you have dialed is unavailable.

930
00:41:37,039 --> 00:41:39,199
Meiqi.

931
00:41:39,400 --> 00:41:40,039
What?

932
00:41:40,960 --> 00:41:41,760
Meiqi.

933
00:41:42,880 --> 00:41:43,720
Quick.

934
00:41:44,559 --> 00:41:45,199
You

935
00:41:46,280 --> 00:41:48,880
use your phone to call Mingzhu.

936
00:41:49,039 --> 00:41:50,679
I tried mine.

937
00:41:50,840 --> 00:41:51,880
It won't go through.

938
00:41:52,159 --> 00:41:53,960
See if she's blocked me.

939
00:41:54,240 --> 00:41:56,400
You can't
keep controlling Mingzhu like this.

940
00:41:56,400 --> 00:41:57,840
What do you mean controlling her?

941
00:41:57,840 --> 00:41:59,440
She's carrying
your brother Jianqi's child.

942
00:41:59,440 --> 00:42:00,559
Your brother's gone now.

943
00:42:00,679 --> 00:42:02,880
I must protect his bloodline.

944
00:42:02,880 --> 00:42:04,039
That's not up to you.

945
00:42:04,039 --> 00:42:05,039
Or to me.

946
00:42:05,320 --> 00:42:06,559
Mingzhu decides for herself.

947
00:42:06,559 --> 00:42:07,960
It's her right to choose.

948
00:42:08,080 --> 00:42:09,240
What about your brother then?

949
00:42:09,690 --> 00:42:12,130
Just because Jianqi's gone,
he loses his right to be a father?

950
00:42:12,159 --> 00:42:13,360
In theory, yes.

951
00:42:13,960 --> 00:42:15,320
What kind of theory is that?

952
00:42:16,280 --> 00:42:18,039
Jianqi died saving someone,
you know that?

953
00:42:18,039 --> 00:42:20,039
He was a hero, a true hero.

954
00:42:20,760 --> 00:42:22,039
And now his death means nothing?

955
00:42:22,559 --> 00:42:24,360
He can't even be a father anymore?

956
00:42:24,679 --> 00:42:25,559
Does that mean

957
00:42:25,559 --> 00:42:26,880
he's no longer part of this world?

958
00:42:26,880 --> 00:42:27,760
Of course no.

959
00:42:27,760 --> 00:42:29,159
He still has us.

960
00:42:30,599 --> 00:42:31,240
No.

961
00:42:31,559 --> 00:42:32,679
Call her.

962
00:42:32,880 --> 00:42:33,479
I won't.

963
00:42:33,479 --> 00:42:34,880
- Will you call her?
- No.

964
00:42:34,880 --> 00:42:35,880
Will you?

965
00:42:37,119 --> 00:42:38,960
You're driving me mad.

966
00:42:39,960 --> 00:42:40,920
Feng Jianqi!

967
00:42:40,920 --> 00:42:42,320
I'm Feng Meiqi!
