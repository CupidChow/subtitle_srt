(Adapted from iceread.com novel
"You Xi" by Qingyang Wanxi)

00:01:14,960 --> 00:01:17,940
=Episode 2=

4
00:01:18,380 --> 00:01:19,580
I'll drive you back.

5
00:01:19,580 --> 00:01:21,020
Later, I'll take a bus to come back.

6
00:01:21,020 --> 00:01:21,860
No need.

7
00:01:22,180 --> 00:01:23,660
Now you care about me.

8
00:01:24,820 --> 00:01:25,980
Zhixia,

9
00:01:26,760 --> 00:01:27,980
Look. Now that you're pregnant,

10
00:01:27,980 --> 00:01:30,100
you should get angry less

11
00:01:30,100 --> 00:01:30,980
and move around less.

12
00:01:30,980 --> 00:01:32,840
I haven't decided
whether to have the baby or not.

13
00:01:33,900 --> 00:01:35,180
Why are you agreeing with her?

14
00:01:35,500 --> 00:01:37,740
Of course, you want it.

15
00:01:37,740 --> 00:01:40,100
Let her make the decision.

16
00:01:40,100 --> 00:01:41,860
Don't listen to your father.

17
00:01:42,260 --> 00:01:44,020
Men know nothing

18
00:01:44,020 --> 00:01:45,460
about the pain of giving birth.

19
00:01:45,660 --> 00:01:46,900
The child is already here.

20
00:01:46,900 --> 00:01:48,100
How can she not keep it?

21
00:01:48,100 --> 00:01:49,860
You need to respect her...

22
00:01:49,860 --> 00:01:50,660
Enough.

23
00:01:51,900 --> 00:01:53,340
I know what I know.

24
00:01:53,340 --> 00:01:54,060
Yes. She can...

25
00:01:54,060 --> 00:01:55,900
Just don't argue, both of you.

26
00:01:55,900 --> 00:01:56,660
You...

27
00:01:56,660 --> 00:01:57,460
Enough.

28
00:02:00,220 --> 00:02:00,940
I'm going back.

29
00:02:03,220 --> 00:02:04,660
Delete my number.

30
00:02:06,100 --> 00:02:06,500
Delete it.

31
00:02:06,500 --> 00:02:07,860
Be careful.

32
00:02:07,860 --> 00:02:08,940
Go.

33
00:02:09,860 --> 00:02:10,900
Careful, Zhixia.

34
00:02:25,500 --> 00:02:26,580
Dear, you are so pretty.

35
00:02:28,960 --> 00:02:31,890
We'll go to the first floor for
the photoshoot when both of you are ready.

36
00:02:31,900 --> 00:02:32,500
All right.

37
00:02:33,460 --> 00:02:34,100
Let's go.

38
00:02:36,500 --> 00:02:37,220
Wait.

39
00:02:41,260 --> 00:02:42,780
You will soon become a mother.

40
00:02:42,780 --> 00:02:44,300
I must protect both of you.

41
00:02:53,900 --> 00:02:54,900
When will you be home?

42
00:02:55,120 --> 00:02:55,860
My mother is here.

43
00:03:11,700 --> 00:03:12,340
Zhang Hao,

44
00:03:13,220 --> 00:03:13,780
look.

45
00:03:14,220 --> 00:03:15,020
It's full of dust.

46
00:03:16,020 --> 00:03:19,020
If you don't sweep your house,
you won't dominate the world.

47
00:03:20,020 --> 00:03:20,740
Wipe it off.

48
00:03:21,360 --> 00:03:23,900
Are you judging my house
by the standards of a five-star hotel?

49
00:03:25,660 --> 00:03:26,340
What?

50
00:03:27,020 --> 00:03:27,980
What are these?

51
00:03:28,620 --> 00:03:29,580
Water bills?

52
00:03:29,580 --> 00:03:31,660
More than 100 yuan for two months?

53
00:03:31,660 --> 00:03:32,740
How are you using water?

54
00:03:33,060 --> 00:03:33,780
How?

55
00:03:33,780 --> 00:03:35,180
Did you open a bathhouse?

56
00:03:36,060 --> 00:03:37,660
Our country's water resources

57
00:03:37,660 --> 00:03:39,220
are very limited.

58
00:03:39,900 --> 00:03:40,660
Come here, Mom.

59
00:03:40,660 --> 00:03:41,740
Sit down.

60
00:03:41,980 --> 00:03:43,140
Take a break.

61
00:03:43,140 --> 00:03:44,620
Enough with your observation.

62
00:03:44,860 --> 00:03:45,660
Isn't a home

63
00:03:45,660 --> 00:03:47,180
and an enterprise the same?

64
00:03:47,180 --> 00:03:48,820
If you don't have a supervision system,

65
00:03:48,820 --> 00:03:49,620
that won't do.

66
00:03:49,620 --> 00:03:50,900
It'll be ruined immediately,

67
00:03:51,140 --> 00:03:52,740
with problems festering like tumors.

68
00:03:53,060 --> 00:03:54,300
You're using idioms now?

69
00:04:04,220 --> 00:04:05,180
Mom, you're here?

70
00:04:05,660 --> 00:04:07,580
I heard you are pregnant

71
00:04:07,580 --> 00:04:09,020
so I came here immediately

72
00:04:09,020 --> 00:04:10,420
to take a look at you.

73
00:04:11,300 --> 00:04:11,820
Seriously.

74
00:04:12,180 --> 00:04:14,300
If you give birth to a boy,

75
00:04:14,700 --> 00:04:16,820
you'll have a son and a daughter.

76
00:04:18,020 --> 00:04:19,300
Our family's structure

77
00:04:19,500 --> 00:04:21,900
will go through a huge change.

78
00:04:21,900 --> 00:04:22,940
It'll be perfect!

79
00:04:26,100 --> 00:04:28,140
We haven't decided
whether to have the child or not.

80
00:04:29,300 --> 00:04:30,260
Why not?

81
00:04:34,100 --> 00:04:34,820
It's expensive.

82
00:04:35,580 --> 00:04:37,700
Jiao needs to learn the piano,

83
00:04:37,700 --> 00:04:39,260
ice skating, and English.

84
00:04:39,260 --> 00:04:40,780
They all cost money. It's expensive.

85
00:04:40,780 --> 00:04:42,140
You have me.

86
00:04:42,420 --> 00:04:43,780
I will support you.

87
00:04:44,740 --> 00:04:45,260
Mom,

88
00:04:45,260 --> 00:04:47,060
I thank you

89
00:04:47,500 --> 00:04:49,740
for willing to subsidize us

90
00:04:50,140 --> 00:04:52,940
but if we raise another child,

91
00:04:53,620 --> 00:04:56,140
the structure of the family
will really change.

92
00:04:56,700 --> 00:04:59,260
This house won't be big enough for us.

93
00:04:59,636 --> 00:05:00,916
We need a three-room unit.

94
00:05:03,140 --> 00:05:05,540
I'm running a we-media account.

95
00:05:06,300 --> 00:05:07,980
I work for myself.

96
00:05:07,980 --> 00:05:10,820
I can still survive today
but I might lose my job tomorrow.

97
00:05:11,260 --> 00:05:13,420
Of course, Zhang Hao's job is stable

98
00:05:13,700 --> 00:05:15,380
but his pay is miserably low.

99
00:05:15,540 --> 00:05:18,340
It's very difficult for us
to find another place to live.

100
00:05:18,340 --> 00:05:20,340
- However, I think the house...
- Let me finish.

101
00:05:20,820 --> 00:05:23,580
When I had Jiao,
I was in my late twenties.

102
00:05:23,780 --> 00:05:25,940
Now, I'm already in my late thirties.

103
00:05:26,180 --> 00:05:28,660
My stamina and energy
aren't as good as they were.

104
00:05:29,260 --> 00:05:30,340
I'm a middle-aged woman now.

105
00:05:30,340 --> 00:05:31,940
I have parents and a kid
to take care of.

106
00:05:31,940 --> 00:05:33,090
It's like having enemies on both sides.

107
00:05:33,100 --> 00:05:34,380
If I raise

108
00:05:34,700 --> 00:05:35,780
another child,

109
00:05:37,020 --> 00:05:37,900
I think

110
00:05:37,900 --> 00:05:39,860
I won't be able to handle it.

111
00:05:41,100 --> 00:05:41,820
Zhixia,

112
00:05:42,460 --> 00:05:44,860
I think there's always a way.

113
00:05:45,100 --> 00:05:46,500
Look at the families of the past.

114
00:05:46,780 --> 00:05:47,580
All of them

115
00:05:47,580 --> 00:05:48,660
had more than five children.

116
00:05:48,660 --> 00:05:49,660
- Yes.
- They all grew up fine.

117
00:05:49,660 --> 00:05:50,620
That's right.

118
00:05:51,020 --> 00:05:52,180
That was in the past.

119
00:05:52,180 --> 00:05:52,780
No.

120
00:05:53,060 --> 00:05:55,460
Worry about giving birth
and not about how to raise a child.

121
00:05:55,460 --> 00:05:57,860
It's the same for every generation.

122
00:05:58,180 --> 00:05:58,980
Here's what I think.

123
00:05:58,980 --> 00:06:00,660
Why is the birth rate so low?

124
00:06:00,660 --> 00:06:02,380
Because young people

125
00:06:02,380 --> 00:06:03,700
have too many considerations

126
00:06:03,700 --> 00:06:05,620
when they give birth to a child.

127
00:06:07,580 --> 00:06:08,180
Zhixia,

128
00:06:08,180 --> 00:06:10,060
let me take a stand right now.

129
00:06:10,900 --> 00:06:12,660
You just need to give birth.

130
00:06:13,220 --> 00:06:15,340
The baby will
stay in your stomach for a while.

131
00:06:15,780 --> 00:06:18,300
I will feed and raise the child.

132
00:06:18,460 --> 00:06:19,300
Let me

133
00:06:19,300 --> 00:06:21,780
raise this child
to be the country's successor.

134
00:06:22,660 --> 00:06:23,140
Mom.

135
00:06:23,140 --> 00:06:24,480
- Well...
- What time is it now?

136
00:06:24,980 --> 00:06:26,140
I should go back.

137
00:06:28,380 --> 00:06:29,460
You are pregnant.

138
00:06:29,460 --> 00:06:31,020
You need to sleep early.

139
00:06:31,020 --> 00:06:31,980
Rest well.

140
00:06:32,540 --> 00:06:33,380
Rest early.

141
00:06:33,380 --> 00:06:34,180
I'm leaving.

142
00:06:34,180 --> 00:06:35,460
- Let me send you off.
- Sit down.

143
00:06:35,460 --> 00:06:36,180
Don't move.

144
00:06:36,180 --> 00:06:37,700
Don't move right now.

145
00:06:37,760 --> 00:06:38,380
I'm going back.

146
00:06:38,380 --> 00:06:39,500
- Let me send you off.
- All right.

147
00:06:39,500 --> 00:06:40,620
Mom, take care.

148
00:06:42,980 --> 00:06:43,700
Slowly.

149
00:06:44,700 --> 00:06:45,420
I'm leaving.

150
00:06:45,420 --> 00:06:46,140
Take care.

151
00:06:46,660 --> 00:06:47,900
Bye.

152
00:06:51,140 --> 00:06:52,260
When you go out...

153
00:06:56,260 --> 00:06:57,260
You speak so fast.

154
00:07:12,940 --> 00:07:13,780
Let's have the baby.

155
00:07:14,580 --> 00:07:16,620
My mother said she'd raise him.

156
00:07:16,860 --> 00:07:18,660
The three greatest lies of the world are

157
00:07:18,710 --> 00:07:20,820
the physician's secret formula
in the martial world,

158
00:07:20,820 --> 00:07:22,380
get-rich-quick schemes
from direct sales groups,

159
00:07:22,380 --> 00:07:24,560
and your mother saying
she'll help you raise the child.

160
00:07:26,100 --> 00:07:27,260
Why are you saying...

161
00:07:27,260 --> 00:07:28,860
What's wrong with that?

162
00:07:29,460 --> 00:07:30,620
When I was pregnant with Jiao,

163
00:07:30,620 --> 00:07:33,020
your mother said the same thing.

164
00:07:33,940 --> 00:07:36,140
You only need to give birth.

165
00:07:36,140 --> 00:07:38,250
The child will only stay
in your stomach for a while.

166
00:07:38,900 --> 00:07:39,940
What next, Zhang Hao?

167
00:07:39,940 --> 00:07:41,370
Before I left my confinement period,

168
00:07:41,380 --> 00:07:43,060
she said her company
wants to rehire her.

169
00:07:43,070 --> 00:07:45,100
It was as if
the earth needed her to spin.

170
00:07:45,100 --> 00:07:46,980
If my mother didn't volunteer,

171
00:07:46,980 --> 00:07:48,020
I couldn't even go to work

172
00:07:48,380 --> 00:07:49,860
after my maternity leave.

173
00:07:50,540 --> 00:07:51,140
Yes.

174
00:07:51,780 --> 00:07:53,820
See? My mother is not dependable

175
00:07:54,260 --> 00:07:55,780
but I am.

176
00:07:56,060 --> 00:07:58,060
Have I been nurturing Jiao well

177
00:07:58,100 --> 00:08:00,060
in every aspect
including her daily necessities?

178
00:08:00,780 --> 00:08:02,380
Of course, you've contributed more.

179
00:08:03,100 --> 00:08:04,940
I still took care of her studies, right?

180
00:08:04,940 --> 00:08:06,780
You need to believe in the people.

181
00:08:06,780 --> 00:08:07,620
No.

182
00:08:08,420 --> 00:08:09,500
I am the people.

183
00:08:09,930 --> 00:08:11,460
I only believe in myself.

184
00:08:18,180 --> 00:08:18,860
The city

185
00:08:18,860 --> 00:08:20,860
is still the same after all these years.

186
00:08:20,860 --> 00:08:22,480
It's still as run down as ever.

187
00:08:22,490 --> 00:08:23,460
It has changed a little.

188
00:08:23,460 --> 00:08:24,060
Mom.

189
00:08:24,060 --> 00:08:25,820
This is the environment of an old city.

190
00:08:26,220 --> 00:08:28,300
Look at that path along the river.

191
00:08:28,300 --> 00:08:29,260
How beautiful it is.

192
00:08:29,860 --> 00:08:30,900
If I don't drive

193
00:08:30,900 --> 00:08:31,900
and ride a shared bike,

194
00:08:31,900 --> 00:08:33,820
I'll reach the design institute
in ten minutes.

195
00:08:35,540 --> 00:08:36,620
Feng Jianqi,

196
00:08:36,620 --> 00:08:39,220
many people work their whole lives
in the old city

197
00:08:39,380 --> 00:08:42,220
just to buy a condominium with a lift

198
00:08:42,620 --> 00:08:44,980
but you have given up
on your bright future

199
00:08:44,980 --> 00:08:46,860
and chose a path less taken.

200
00:08:47,580 --> 00:08:49,580
I don't know what you are thinking.

201
00:08:49,580 --> 00:08:51,860
Your father's colleagues introduced you

202
00:08:52,100 --> 00:08:53,380
to the daughter of a commissioner

203
00:08:53,380 --> 00:08:54,540
and the niece of the chief.

204
00:08:54,540 --> 00:08:56,340
All of them
were better than Shen Mingzhu.

205
00:08:56,580 --> 00:08:57,780
Mom, what do you mean?

206
00:08:57,780 --> 00:08:58,900
That's enough.

207
00:08:58,900 --> 00:09:00,660
Didn't we agree
not to bring this up again?

208
00:09:00,660 --> 00:09:01,660
I'm telling you.

209
00:09:01,660 --> 00:09:03,820
I am an educated person.

210
00:09:03,820 --> 00:09:04,740
My culture

211
00:09:04,740 --> 00:09:06,740
is built on money.

212
00:09:06,740 --> 00:09:08,700
Fine. You are educated

213
00:09:08,700 --> 00:09:09,580
and you are cultured.

214
00:09:09,580 --> 00:09:10,220
Yes.

215
00:09:17,620 --> 00:09:18,700
There are a few more dishes.

216
00:09:18,700 --> 00:09:19,780
Hurry up. They'll be here soon.

217
00:09:19,780 --> 00:09:20,300
It's the last one.

218
00:09:20,300 --> 00:09:21,500
We haven't changed our clothes yet.

219
00:09:21,500 --> 00:09:22,340
I know.

220
00:09:24,980 --> 00:09:25,620
Dad!

221
00:09:26,100 --> 00:09:27,540
You are making

222
00:09:27,540 --> 00:09:28,660
all your secret dishes today.

223
00:09:28,820 --> 00:09:29,780
Enough nonsense.

224
00:09:29,780 --> 00:09:30,940
Ask your sister

225
00:09:30,940 --> 00:09:31,940
where they are now.

226
00:09:32,820 --> 00:09:33,460
Mingzhu,

227
00:09:33,780 --> 00:09:35,380
Dad is asking where Jianqi is.

228
00:09:35,620 --> 00:09:36,580
They'll be here soon!

229
00:09:37,600 --> 00:09:38,860
They have entered the old city.

230
00:09:39,160 --> 00:09:40,320
They've entered the old city?

231
00:09:40,940 --> 00:09:41,780
So many dishes.

232
00:09:41,780 --> 00:09:42,780
Eat one.

233
00:09:43,450 --> 00:09:44,300
You're eating already?

234
00:09:44,300 --> 00:09:45,840
- They won't notice a missing prawn.
- Eat.

235
00:09:50,900 --> 00:09:52,140
What are you doing?

236
00:09:52,140 --> 00:09:52,980
I'm blurred.

237
00:09:52,980 --> 00:09:53,900
Boss, two people.

238
00:09:53,900 --> 00:09:54,420
Here you go.

239
00:09:55,580 --> 00:09:56,460
Just put it here.

240
00:09:57,900 --> 00:09:58,780
Sorry.

241
00:09:59,140 --> 00:10:00,980
There's a joyous occasion
in our family today.

242
00:10:01,780 --> 00:10:02,460
Have a cigarette.

243
00:10:02,740 --> 00:10:03,860
Have a cigarette. Here.

244
00:10:03,860 --> 00:10:04,460
Thank you.

245
00:10:04,980 --> 00:10:07,420
We won't be opening today.

246
00:10:07,450 --> 00:10:08,530
There's a joyous occasion?

247
00:10:08,540 --> 00:10:09,460
All right.

248
00:10:09,460 --> 00:10:10,460
- Sure.
- Sorry.

249
00:10:10,700 --> 00:10:11,820
Hurry up.

250
00:10:11,820 --> 00:10:12,420
Come again.

251
00:10:12,420 --> 00:10:13,060
Sure.

252
00:10:13,060 --> 00:10:14,580
Hang up the sign saying we are closed.

253
00:10:14,580 --> 00:10:14,940
Hurry up.

254
00:10:14,940 --> 00:10:15,820
Mom, help me clean up.

255
00:10:15,820 --> 00:10:16,380
I...

256
00:10:17,100 --> 00:10:17,980
This kid.

257
00:10:17,980 --> 00:10:19,220
Shen, hurry up!

258
00:10:19,460 --> 00:10:20,500
Get changed!

259
00:10:20,500 --> 00:10:21,330
Your face is so oily.

260
00:10:21,340 --> 00:10:21,780
Throw this.

261
00:10:21,780 --> 00:10:22,860
Give it to me.

262
00:10:22,860 --> 00:10:24,140
Quickly! Go upstairs!

263
00:10:24,360 --> 00:10:25,420
Go and get changed. Hurry.

264
00:10:25,420 --> 00:10:26,380
Go on.

265
00:10:26,420 --> 00:10:28,380
(Western Ginseng, Expiry Date)

266
00:10:28,860 --> 00:10:30,460
The Western Ginseng is going to expire.

267
00:10:30,860 --> 00:10:32,180
There's still a month to go.

268
00:10:32,700 --> 00:10:34,860
Tell them to eat it quickly.

269
00:10:34,860 --> 00:10:35,700
It's very nourishing.

270
00:10:40,540 --> 00:10:41,180
Mom,

271
00:10:41,660 --> 00:10:42,580
this is not right.

272
00:10:43,100 --> 00:10:44,660
What's not right about it?

273
00:10:44,660 --> 00:10:46,180
The Western Ginseng is very expensive,

274
00:10:46,180 --> 00:10:46,900
I'm telling you.

275
00:10:46,900 --> 00:10:49,060
I'm sure they won't
spend money to buy it.

276
00:10:49,380 --> 00:10:50,340
Jianqi, let me tell you.

277
00:10:50,340 --> 00:10:51,620
Western Ginseng must be kept dry.

278
00:10:51,630 --> 00:10:53,340
It can still be eaten
as long as it's not expired.

279
00:10:53,340 --> 00:10:54,060
It's fine.

280
00:10:54,060 --> 00:10:54,740
That's right.

281
00:10:54,740 --> 00:10:57,340
Dad. This is not about
whether it can still be eaten or not

282
00:10:57,350 --> 00:10:59,260
but whether we are
showing them respect or not.

283
00:11:00,100 --> 00:11:01,960
Feng Jianqi, what are you talking about?

284
00:11:01,960 --> 00:11:03,180
How are we not respecting them?

285
00:11:03,180 --> 00:11:04,660
Both of us

286
00:11:04,660 --> 00:11:05,900
are bringing so many gifts

287
00:11:05,900 --> 00:11:07,140
to visit

288
00:11:07,140 --> 00:11:08,500
a shop run by a married couple.

289
00:11:08,500 --> 00:11:10,620
Is that not showing respect?
What else do you want?

290
00:11:10,620 --> 00:11:12,500
Mom, isn't that what we should do?
I'm getting married.

291
00:11:12,500 --> 00:11:14,820
That's enough. Stop arguing.

292
00:11:15,060 --> 00:11:16,580
Just leave the Western Ginseng.

293
00:11:16,980 --> 00:11:18,020
That's a small matter.

294
00:11:19,260 --> 00:11:20,140
Jianqi,

295
00:11:20,580 --> 00:11:22,460
a marriage
is merging two families together.

296
00:11:23,180 --> 00:11:24,940
There'll be conflicts in the future.

297
00:11:25,500 --> 00:11:27,340
Don't simply start an argument.

298
00:11:28,740 --> 00:11:31,900
After all, Mingzhu is a good girl.

299
00:11:34,260 --> 00:11:36,220
Your mother is also a good mother.

300
00:11:38,380 --> 00:11:39,220
A good mother?

301
00:11:39,900 --> 00:11:40,860
Am I not?

302
00:11:41,780 --> 00:11:42,580
You are.

303
00:11:46,940 --> 00:11:47,420
Brother!

304
00:11:47,420 --> 00:11:47,900
There's another car!

305
00:11:47,900 --> 00:11:48,940
Slowly. Be careful of the child.

306
00:11:48,940 --> 00:11:49,740
There's another car!

307
00:11:49,740 --> 00:11:50,500
Deal with it!

308
00:11:50,500 --> 00:11:50,940
Slowly!

309
00:11:50,940 --> 00:11:52,140
Hurry up!

310
00:11:52,140 --> 00:11:53,300
Go! Quickly!

311
00:11:53,300 --> 00:11:55,540
A member of my neighbor's family
is getting married.

312
00:11:55,540 --> 00:11:57,180
Later, their in-laws are coming.

313
00:11:57,180 --> 00:11:58,040
Can you leave a spot?

314
00:11:58,570 --> 00:11:59,220
Help me out.

315
00:11:59,220 --> 00:12:00,740
There's no parking here.

316
00:12:00,740 --> 00:12:01,380
Help me out. Thank you.

317
00:12:01,380 --> 00:12:02,020
Mister.

318
00:12:02,220 --> 00:12:03,980
My sister...

319
00:12:04,180 --> 00:12:05,220
She's very ugly.

320
00:12:05,220 --> 00:12:06,180
She finally

321
00:12:06,180 --> 00:12:07,140
got married.

322
00:12:07,140 --> 00:12:09,460
Can you do a good deed and help us out?

323
00:12:09,470 --> 00:12:10,860
There's a parking area
in front after turning left.

324
00:12:10,860 --> 00:12:11,900
Yes. It's very near.

325
00:12:11,900 --> 00:12:12,820
Fine.

326
00:12:12,820 --> 00:12:14,500
Thank you.

327
00:12:18,900 --> 00:12:19,660
Mingzhu, look.

328
00:12:20,300 --> 00:12:21,300
How do I look?

329
00:12:22,580 --> 00:12:24,580
Dad, you are so handsome.

330
00:12:24,580 --> 00:12:25,460
A new shirt.

331
00:12:26,100 --> 00:12:26,540
Mingzhu,

332
00:12:26,540 --> 00:12:27,820
is this your perfume?

333
00:12:27,830 --> 00:12:28,740
- Come here.
- What are you doing?

334
00:12:28,740 --> 00:12:29,940
Put your hands up.

335
00:12:29,940 --> 00:12:31,340
You smell like oil and smoke.

336
00:12:31,500 --> 00:12:32,140
Mom.

337
00:12:32,340 --> 00:12:33,500
This is for women.

338
00:12:33,500 --> 00:12:34,860
It's fine. It just has to smell good.

339
00:12:34,860 --> 00:12:35,660
Why are you spraying this?

340
00:12:35,660 --> 00:12:37,100
You smell like oil and smoke.

341
00:12:37,100 --> 00:12:38,620
Put your hands up and close your eyes.

342
00:12:39,140 --> 00:12:40,460
You haven't opened it.

343
00:12:41,060 --> 00:12:41,860
I was wondering...

344
00:12:42,220 --> 00:12:43,780
Turn around and close your eyes.

345
00:12:43,780 --> 00:12:45,060
Quickly. They'll be here soon.

346
00:12:45,060 --> 00:12:46,140
What are you doing?

347
00:12:46,140 --> 00:12:47,180
You can't just spray him

348
00:12:47,180 --> 00:12:48,860
like spraying a cockroach.

349
00:12:48,860 --> 00:12:50,180
Your mother
always treats me like a pest.

350
00:12:50,180 --> 00:12:51,300
That's better.

351
00:12:51,300 --> 00:12:51,860
- Is that fine?
- Hurry.

352
00:12:51,860 --> 00:12:52,500
Hurry. Let's go.

353
00:12:52,500 --> 00:12:53,180
Let's go.

354
00:12:53,180 --> 00:12:53,780
Wait.

355
00:12:53,780 --> 00:12:55,140
Is my necklace sitting right?

356
00:12:55,140 --> 00:12:55,660
Yes.

357
00:12:55,660 --> 00:12:56,340
It's straight.

358
00:12:56,340 --> 00:12:57,580
Let's go.

359
00:12:57,860 --> 00:12:58,580
Wait.

360
00:12:59,100 --> 00:13:01,020
Should I roll up my sleeves
or button it?

361
00:13:01,020 --> 00:13:01,860
No need. That's good enough.

362
00:13:01,860 --> 00:13:03,060
Button it.

363
00:13:03,060 --> 00:13:03,780
All right.

364
00:13:04,820 --> 00:13:05,940
Congratulations.

365
00:13:06,980 --> 00:13:08,300
Run slowly.

366
00:13:08,300 --> 00:13:09,740
You'll get wedding candies later.

367
00:13:09,940 --> 00:13:11,660
Look at the clear weather.

368
00:13:11,660 --> 00:13:13,160
Look how happy your mom and dad are.

369
00:13:14,180 --> 00:13:15,140
They are here.

370
00:13:16,620 --> 00:13:17,340
They are here.

371
00:13:17,740 --> 00:13:18,500
Hurry.

372
00:13:18,860 --> 00:13:19,700
Just park here.

373
00:13:20,100 --> 00:13:21,140
It's all our place.

374
00:13:21,140 --> 00:13:22,020
Just park here.

375
00:13:22,020 --> 00:13:22,780
All right.

376
00:13:22,780 --> 00:13:23,820
I've never seen this before.

377
00:13:23,820 --> 00:13:25,020
It's a premium car.

378
00:13:25,220 --> 00:13:26,100
It's a premium car.

379
00:13:26,100 --> 00:13:27,140
Welcome.

380
00:13:27,700 --> 00:13:28,220
Slowly.

381
00:13:28,220 --> 00:13:29,540
Hello.

382
00:13:29,860 --> 00:13:30,700
- Hello.
- Mr. Feng.

383
00:13:30,700 --> 00:13:31,900
They are my parents.

384
00:13:31,900 --> 00:13:33,140
This is Shen Minghui,
my younger brother.

385
00:13:33,140 --> 00:13:33,820
Hello, Mr. Feng and Mrs. Feng.

386
00:13:33,820 --> 00:13:34,580
Hello.

387
00:13:36,100 --> 00:13:36,900
What's wrong?

388
00:13:36,900 --> 00:13:38,460
Who put on so much perfume?

389
00:13:38,460 --> 00:13:39,540
I'm allergic.

390
00:13:40,860 --> 00:13:41,620
Shen.

391
00:13:45,260 --> 00:13:46,500
This is a small road.

392
00:13:46,500 --> 00:13:48,700
Must be tough
for a premium car like yours.

393
00:13:49,060 --> 00:13:49,940
It's all right.

394
00:13:49,940 --> 00:13:52,060
I also lived in Old City.

395
00:13:52,260 --> 00:13:52,940
When I was young,

396
00:13:52,940 --> 00:13:54,420
I was running around here.

397
00:13:54,420 --> 00:13:55,900
However, nothing much has changed

398
00:13:55,900 --> 00:13:57,780
after so many years.

399
00:13:58,780 --> 00:13:59,340
Yes.

400
00:13:59,340 --> 00:14:01,780
I feel like I've returned
to the time when I was young.

401
00:14:02,420 --> 00:14:03,020
Mrs. Feng,

402
00:14:03,020 --> 00:14:04,140
don't say that.

403
00:14:04,140 --> 00:14:05,460
You are still very young now.

404
00:14:05,460 --> 00:14:07,180
Look how healthy your skin is.

405
00:14:07,180 --> 00:14:08,660
There aren't any wrinkles.

406
00:14:08,660 --> 00:14:10,900
You don't look like
a grandmother at all.

407
00:14:10,900 --> 00:14:13,060
Women must take care of themselves.

408
00:14:13,260 --> 00:14:13,980
Mingzhu,

409
00:14:14,420 --> 00:14:16,580
share the bird's nest
I'm giving you with your mother.

410
00:14:16,900 --> 00:14:17,580
Sure.

411
00:14:18,300 --> 00:14:20,140
Dad, let's talk inside.

412
00:14:20,340 --> 00:14:20,860
Yes.

413
00:14:21,188 --> 00:14:22,708
Why are we standing outside?

414
00:14:22,860 --> 00:14:23,820
Come inside.

415
00:14:23,820 --> 00:14:24,820
Yes. Please come inside.

416
00:14:24,820 --> 00:14:25,740
We'll be going back.

417
00:14:27,900 --> 00:14:28,500
Thank you.

418
00:14:28,500 --> 00:14:29,260
Mingzhu.

419
00:14:29,260 --> 00:14:31,780
You are blessed. How great.

420
00:14:31,780 --> 00:14:32,980
This way, please.

421
00:14:32,980 --> 00:14:34,100
This is an old house.

422
00:14:34,100 --> 00:14:35,380
- Old house.
- It's nice.

423
00:14:35,700 --> 00:14:38,020
This is probably
a few hundred years old.

424
00:14:38,300 --> 00:14:39,660
Sit and talk. Please.

425
00:14:39,660 --> 00:14:40,700
Sit down.

426
00:14:40,700 --> 00:14:41,340
Sure.

427
00:14:43,140 --> 00:14:44,620
What a feast.

428
00:14:44,620 --> 00:14:45,860
There are so many dishes.

429
00:14:45,860 --> 00:14:46,460
What a feast.

430
00:14:46,460 --> 00:14:46,900
Sit down.

431
00:14:46,900 --> 00:14:48,260
Thank you for your treat.

432
00:14:48,270 --> 00:14:50,620
My parents started preparing
for this feast a long time ago.

433
00:14:50,620 --> 00:14:51,660
They bought turtles
from the Western market

434
00:14:51,660 --> 00:14:52,740
and chicken from the Eastern market.

435
00:14:52,740 --> 00:14:54,220
They've been preparing for many days.

436
00:14:55,500 --> 00:14:56,460
It's just a simple meal.

437
00:14:56,940 --> 00:14:59,140
I don't know
if they suit your taste buds.

438
00:14:59,140 --> 00:15:00,020
That's wonderful.

439
00:15:00,020 --> 00:15:01,900
All of you are too polite.

440
00:15:01,900 --> 00:15:04,420
How can we finish so many dishes?

441
00:15:04,940 --> 00:15:07,180
All of us have small appetites.

442
00:15:08,380 --> 00:15:09,620
It's fine, Mrs. Feng.

443
00:15:10,240 --> 00:15:12,240
Whether you can finish them or not
doesn't matter.

444
00:15:12,940 --> 00:15:14,460
You are our esteemed guest.

445
00:15:14,820 --> 00:15:17,460
My father used everything he learned
to make these dishes.

446
00:15:17,931 --> 00:15:19,771
Think of it as his sincerity.

447
00:15:20,260 --> 00:15:21,260
- Sure.
- That's right.

448
00:15:21,260 --> 00:15:22,180
Thank you.

449
00:15:22,180 --> 00:15:23,300
He's right.

450
00:15:23,300 --> 00:15:24,700
It's a show of sincerity.

451
00:15:25,700 --> 00:15:28,180
Well, let me start things off.

452
00:15:29,340 --> 00:15:31,940
Today, I want to welcome the in-laws.

453
00:15:32,460 --> 00:15:33,660
I'll call you that from now on.

454
00:15:33,940 --> 00:15:36,700
Our in-laws have come
to visit our humble abode.

455
00:15:37,300 --> 00:15:37,900
Look.

456
00:15:37,900 --> 00:15:39,780
It's has become glorious.

457
00:15:40,340 --> 00:15:41,940
Since we have sat at this table,

458
00:15:42,380 --> 00:15:43,420
we are a family now.

459
00:15:43,660 --> 00:15:45,180
We will be honest with each other.

460
00:15:46,700 --> 00:15:47,820
I prepared some wine.

461
00:15:47,820 --> 00:15:49,380
Minghui, pour the wine.

462
00:15:49,660 --> 00:15:50,460
Let me do it.

463
00:15:50,980 --> 00:15:51,540
Jianqi.

464
00:15:51,900 --> 00:15:52,460
I'm driving.

465
00:15:53,020 --> 00:15:54,540
I'm driving so I won't be drinking.

466
00:15:54,780 --> 00:15:56,660
Let's drink tea and beverages

467
00:15:57,300 --> 00:15:58,300
in place of wine.

468
00:15:58,820 --> 00:16:00,620
Thank you for your treat.

469
00:16:01,540 --> 00:16:02,300
That's fine.

470
00:16:02,500 --> 00:16:03,340
Do as you wish.

471
00:16:03,410 --> 00:16:04,260
Let me pour the wine.

472
00:16:04,260 --> 00:16:06,140
I can present myself
to my brother-in-law.

473
00:16:06,140 --> 00:16:06,940
Do you know?

474
00:16:08,060 --> 00:16:08,780
All right.

475
00:16:08,780 --> 00:16:10,300
Not bad, Feng Jianqi.

476
00:16:10,700 --> 00:16:12,700
You are so hardworking now.

477
00:16:13,260 --> 00:16:14,580
I've never seen you

478
00:16:14,580 --> 00:16:16,660
pour wine for us at home.

479
00:16:17,460 --> 00:16:19,260
You are so hardworking

480
00:16:19,260 --> 00:16:21,700
when it comes to serving
your father-in-law and mother-in-law.

481
00:16:21,900 --> 00:16:23,100
Good job.

482
00:16:23,580 --> 00:16:25,780
That's because
Mingzhu has educated you well.

483
00:16:25,940 --> 00:16:26,620
I'm impressed.

484
00:16:27,700 --> 00:16:29,460
You must be joking, Mrs. Feng.

485
00:16:30,060 --> 00:16:32,060
Mingzhu, why are you
still calling her Mrs. Feng?

486
00:16:34,460 --> 00:16:35,100
Well...

487
00:16:35,260 --> 00:16:37,260
Let's wait until
the wedding banquet is completed.

488
00:16:37,260 --> 00:16:38,420
After that, I'll change.

489
00:16:38,420 --> 00:16:41,020
No. You're a legal couple
after getting the certificate.

490
00:16:41,020 --> 00:16:42,420
Call her.

491
00:16:43,460 --> 00:16:44,660
Our family

492
00:16:44,660 --> 00:16:46,020
is about the traditional rules.

493
00:16:46,460 --> 00:16:48,180
They must bow to their parents

494
00:16:48,460 --> 00:16:50,900
and get red packets
before they can change.

495
00:16:51,460 --> 00:16:52,540
These are the rules.

496
00:16:53,660 --> 00:16:54,460
Right, Feng?

497
00:16:59,380 --> 00:17:00,020
Mom.

498
00:17:00,260 --> 00:17:01,460
Stop talking about rules.

499
00:17:01,470 --> 00:17:02,940
I'll change the way I address them.

500
00:17:03,900 --> 00:17:05,180
Dad. Mom.

501
00:17:06,200 --> 00:17:07,260
Let me offer you a toast.

502
00:17:12,060 --> 00:17:12,620
Good.

503
00:17:14,660 --> 00:17:15,460
Drink slowly.

504
00:17:16,260 --> 00:17:17,140
Drink less.

505
00:17:17,820 --> 00:17:18,620
It's all right.

506
00:17:18,820 --> 00:17:19,780
My mission today

507
00:17:19,780 --> 00:17:21,380
is to drink with Dad until he's happy.

508
00:17:22,420 --> 00:17:24,460
Look at Feng Jianqi.

509
00:17:24,660 --> 00:17:27,020
He is such a sweet talker now.

510
00:17:27,700 --> 00:17:29,100
Mom, what are you saying?

511
00:17:29,460 --> 00:17:30,260
Mingzhu,

512
00:17:30,540 --> 00:17:32,060
offer a toast to my mom and dad.

513
00:17:32,060 --> 00:17:32,620
All right.

514
00:17:38,700 --> 00:17:39,300
Dad.

515
00:17:39,780 --> 00:17:40,420
All right.

516
00:17:40,860 --> 00:17:41,460
Mom.

517
00:17:42,700 --> 00:17:43,540
Mingzhu,

518
00:17:44,020 --> 00:17:45,300
get me a glass of tea.

519
00:17:45,940 --> 00:17:47,100
I don't drink sweet drinks.

520
00:17:47,460 --> 00:17:47,940
Sure.

521
00:17:48,180 --> 00:17:49,260
Let me do it.

522
00:17:49,460 --> 00:17:50,660
Well, it was my bad. I forgot.

523
00:17:50,660 --> 00:17:51,820
Mingzhu, sit down.

524
00:17:51,820 --> 00:17:52,540
Let me do it.

525
00:17:52,540 --> 00:17:52,940
Minghui can do it.

526
00:17:52,940 --> 00:17:53,700
Let me do it, Mingzhu.

527
00:17:53,700 --> 00:17:54,580
It's all right.

528
00:17:55,780 --> 00:17:57,420
The Shen family is lively today.

529
00:17:58,220 --> 00:17:59,020
Do you know?

530
00:17:59,410 --> 00:18:02,060
Shen Shengli purposely ordered
a bottle of Wuliangye wine from me.

531
00:18:02,540 --> 00:18:03,260
Really?

532
00:18:03,270 --> 00:18:05,180
They've spent a lot of money
to please their in-laws.

533
00:18:05,180 --> 00:18:05,860
They've spent a lot of money.

534
00:18:05,860 --> 00:18:06,860
Right?

535
00:18:07,540 --> 00:18:08,980
Kids!

536
00:18:09,380 --> 00:18:10,420
Stop playing around here!

537
00:18:10,430 --> 00:18:11,820
Do you know how much the car costs?

538
00:18:11,820 --> 00:18:13,900
You can't afford to pay. Go away!

539
00:18:13,900 --> 00:18:15,260
Xiaoni, don't go.

540
00:18:15,260 --> 00:18:16,020
Go!

541
00:18:16,020 --> 00:18:17,580
Go and play over there!

542
00:18:17,580 --> 00:18:18,140
Isn't it cool?

543
00:18:18,140 --> 00:18:18,740
Yes.

544
00:18:19,040 --> 00:18:19,700
It's cool, right?

545
00:18:19,700 --> 00:18:20,940
So cool.

546
00:18:20,940 --> 00:18:22,500
Isn't the big car pretty?

547
00:18:22,860 --> 00:18:23,940
Is it pretty?

548
00:18:25,180 --> 00:18:26,940
You have a big red box in your car

549
00:18:26,940 --> 00:18:27,940
that you forgot.

550
00:18:28,540 --> 00:18:29,700
It's not a gift.

551
00:18:29,700 --> 00:18:32,340
Do you not want
to give it to your in-laws?

552
00:18:32,700 --> 00:18:33,660
Don't speak nonsense.

553
00:18:34,100 --> 00:18:34,940
How do you know?

554
00:18:34,940 --> 00:18:36,840
When my father
goes to my grandfather's house,

555
00:18:36,850 --> 00:18:39,257
he'd always keep something in the car.

556
00:18:41,020 --> 00:18:42,540
Don't speak nonsense.

557
00:18:44,180 --> 00:18:45,500
The child knows nothing.

558
00:18:45,500 --> 00:18:46,140
It's all right.

559
00:18:46,140 --> 00:18:48,180
The child knows nothing
but what about the adult?

560
00:18:49,780 --> 00:18:50,940
Sorry.

561
00:18:52,580 --> 00:18:53,940
Let's go. Let's go home.

562
00:18:53,940 --> 00:18:54,960
I'm not going home.

563
00:18:54,960 --> 00:18:55,960
What are you going to do?

564
00:18:55,970 --> 00:18:57,180
I'm not going home!

565
00:18:57,180 --> 00:18:58,460
Can't you see
that they don't welcome us?

566
00:18:58,460 --> 00:18:59,500
I'm not going home!

567
00:18:59,500 --> 00:19:00,180
Let's go home.

568
00:19:00,180 --> 00:19:00,820
Mom.

569
00:19:01,180 --> 00:19:02,940
They've been neighbors for decades.

570
00:19:03,180 --> 00:19:04,340
Can't you be more polite?

571
00:19:04,340 --> 00:19:06,100
I hate people who gossip.

572
00:19:06,460 --> 00:19:08,260
People see your politeness
as a blessing.

573
00:19:09,320 --> 00:19:10,940
You need to know where to draw the line.

574
00:19:10,940 --> 00:19:12,420
Why haven't you learned?

575
00:19:13,860 --> 00:19:15,700
We are here to discuss your marriage

576
00:19:15,700 --> 00:19:16,580
but you came out

577
00:19:16,580 --> 00:19:18,340
to play with children.

578
00:19:19,420 --> 00:19:20,140
Come inside.

579
00:19:20,260 --> 00:19:22,420
What will happen
when Mingzhu marries into his family?

580
00:19:22,420 --> 00:19:23,940
This mother-in-law is hard to please.

581
00:19:23,940 --> 00:19:24,820
She's quite fierce.

582
00:19:25,060 --> 00:19:26,380
Mingzhu will suffer

583
00:19:26,720 --> 00:19:27,540
in the future.

584
00:19:28,100 --> 00:19:29,140
Cheers.

585
00:19:33,300 --> 00:19:34,460
I'm fine. I'm happy today.

586
00:19:34,940 --> 00:19:35,660
Mr. Shen,

587
00:19:37,340 --> 00:19:38,460
we are here

588
00:19:38,700 --> 00:19:40,180
to discuss

589
00:19:40,300 --> 00:19:41,460
our children's marriage.

590
00:19:42,380 --> 00:19:44,660
Our children's marriage
is a joyous occasion.

591
00:19:45,060 --> 00:19:46,300
So, the wedding

592
00:19:46,300 --> 00:19:47,700
must be organized

593
00:19:47,820 --> 00:19:49,740
with splendor.

594
00:19:49,740 --> 00:19:50,940
Absolutely.

595
00:19:50,940 --> 00:19:53,580
A wedding must feel ceremonial.

596
00:19:53,580 --> 00:19:54,500
That's right.

597
00:19:54,740 --> 00:19:55,620
It must be ceremonial.

598
00:19:56,420 --> 00:19:58,180
Whatever you think is suitable,

599
00:19:58,340 --> 00:19:59,580
we will follow suit.

600
00:20:00,260 --> 00:20:01,020
That's right.

601
00:20:01,180 --> 00:20:02,660
As long as it's best for the children,

602
00:20:02,940 --> 00:20:04,020
we are fine with anything.

603
00:20:04,020 --> 00:20:05,020
We are fine.

604
00:20:05,020 --> 00:20:05,980
All right.

605
00:20:06,260 --> 00:20:07,220
It's like this.

606
00:20:07,780 --> 00:20:08,860
We want

607
00:20:08,860 --> 00:20:11,580
to organize the wedding at Lijun Hotel.

608
00:20:12,100 --> 00:20:13,900
There's a dome in their banquet hall.

609
00:20:13,900 --> 00:20:14,900
It's very majestic.

610
00:20:16,340 --> 00:20:17,780
It can fit 100 tables.

611
00:20:18,460 --> 00:20:19,580
That's too expensive.

612
00:20:19,580 --> 00:20:21,420
- You'll be paying a lot of money.
- Not at all.

613
00:20:21,420 --> 00:20:22,580
A little expensive is fine.

614
00:20:23,020 --> 00:20:23,980
We make money as parents

615
00:20:23,980 --> 00:20:25,380
for the sake of our children.

616
00:20:25,700 --> 00:20:26,260
Yes.

617
00:20:26,660 --> 00:20:27,820
You are right.

618
00:20:27,820 --> 00:20:28,900
It's for our children.

619
00:20:28,900 --> 00:20:29,460
Yes.

620
00:20:29,860 --> 00:20:32,580
How many tables
are you going to organize?

621
00:20:33,540 --> 00:20:36,220
We made a rough calculation.

622
00:20:36,820 --> 00:20:38,060
Basically, our family

623
00:20:38,060 --> 00:20:39,740
has been doing business for a long time

624
00:20:39,740 --> 00:20:41,100
so we know more people.

625
00:20:41,460 --> 00:20:42,460
There are many

626
00:20:42,460 --> 00:20:45,340
40 tables might not be enough.

627
00:20:45,340 --> 00:20:46,460
Yes. That's a must.

628
00:20:46,700 --> 00:20:47,660
That's necessary.

629
00:20:47,820 --> 00:20:50,180
All of you know many people.

630
00:20:50,340 --> 00:20:50,820
Right?

631
00:20:51,100 --> 00:20:53,060
It's normal to have 40 to 50 tables.

632
00:20:53,060 --> 00:20:53,780
That's right.

633
00:20:53,780 --> 00:20:54,740
The more guests,

634
00:20:54,740 --> 00:20:56,060
the more festive it is.

635
00:20:56,060 --> 00:20:57,380
We doesn't have
that many guests.

636
00:20:57,380 --> 00:20:58,540
Just ten tables.

637
00:21:00,020 --> 00:21:01,100
Didn't we agree

638
00:21:01,100 --> 00:21:02,980
to have at least 15 tables?

639
00:21:03,860 --> 00:21:04,940
Do we have that many people?

640
00:21:05,100 --> 00:21:07,460
No. Mrs. Shen.

641
00:21:08,060 --> 00:21:09,500
Mr. Shen.

642
00:21:09,500 --> 00:21:10,060
To save money.

643
00:21:11,340 --> 00:21:11,780
Go ahead.

644
00:21:13,860 --> 00:21:16,380
We have a request to ask.

645
00:21:16,380 --> 00:21:17,540
What do you mean?

646
00:21:17,900 --> 00:21:19,780
Don't be offended by this.

647
00:21:20,500 --> 00:21:21,700
Why should we?

648
00:21:21,700 --> 00:21:23,580
We are discussing the wedding.

649
00:21:23,580 --> 00:21:25,620
There's nothing
to feel offended about. Say it.

650
00:21:25,620 --> 00:21:26,420
It's for them.

651
00:21:26,420 --> 00:21:27,180
That's great.

652
00:21:27,780 --> 00:21:29,220
Well...

653
00:21:29,780 --> 00:21:31,540
Fine, I'll say it.

654
00:21:33,300 --> 00:21:34,060
It's like this.

655
00:21:34,460 --> 00:21:35,300
We have decided

656
00:21:37,060 --> 00:21:38,700
to hold our own weddings.

657
00:21:41,300 --> 00:21:42,660
The groom's side

658
00:21:42,900 --> 00:21:44,260
will be held at Lijun Hotel.

659
00:21:44,660 --> 00:21:45,500
During the wedding,

660
00:21:45,500 --> 00:21:47,580
guests from the bride's side
do not have to attend.

661
00:21:48,460 --> 00:21:49,900
It's too far

662
00:21:49,900 --> 00:21:50,840
and it's inconvenient.

663
00:21:51,460 --> 00:21:54,100
All of you can hold the banquet

664
00:21:54,100 --> 00:21:55,060
at a nearby hotel.

665
00:21:59,260 --> 00:22:01,100
It's like this?

666
00:22:01,100 --> 00:22:02,260
We hold our own weddings?

667
00:22:02,460 --> 00:22:03,180
Well...

668
00:22:03,340 --> 00:22:04,940
It's still quite reasonable.

669
00:22:04,940 --> 00:22:05,780
Exactly.

670
00:22:05,940 --> 00:22:06,980
Mr. Feng. Mrs. Feng.

671
00:22:07,580 --> 00:22:09,580
I think that's not quite right.

672
00:22:09,580 --> 00:22:10,620
No.

673
00:22:11,380 --> 00:22:12,500
It's not right at all.

674
00:22:12,500 --> 00:22:14,020
What do you mean?

675
00:22:14,020 --> 00:22:15,180
I think it's right.

676
00:22:15,180 --> 00:22:16,940
Your parents have agreed.

677
00:22:16,940 --> 00:22:18,020
Of course, it's not.

678
00:22:18,620 --> 00:22:20,060
If my parents are not going,

679
00:22:20,620 --> 00:22:21,740
my sister shouldn't go.

680
00:22:21,800 --> 00:22:23,460
Just get Feng Jianqi
to attend on his own.

681
00:22:23,460 --> 00:22:24,820
Shen Minghui, shut up.

682
00:22:24,820 --> 00:22:26,060
The child is speaking nonsense.

683
00:22:26,060 --> 00:22:27,140
Apologize, hurry.

684
00:22:27,140 --> 00:22:28,300
Why should I apologize, Mom?

685
00:22:28,820 --> 00:22:30,660
They are obviously
looking down on our family.

686
00:22:31,060 --> 00:22:32,340
Why should we apologize?

687
00:22:32,340 --> 00:22:33,260
Stand up.

688
00:22:33,260 --> 00:22:34,620
Mom, I'm not going back.

689
00:22:35,210 --> 00:22:35,780
If I go back,

690
00:22:35,780 --> 00:22:37,260
Mingzhu will be badly bullied.

691
00:22:37,900 --> 00:22:38,860
Minghui, calm down.

692
00:22:38,860 --> 00:22:39,660
Me?

693
00:22:40,020 --> 00:22:41,540
Has your family spoken politely?

694
00:22:41,780 --> 00:22:44,580
The more polite our family is,
the more your family tries to bully us.

695
00:22:44,580 --> 00:22:45,700
Don't point at others.

696
00:22:46,220 --> 00:22:47,420
My sister is getting married.

697
00:22:47,540 --> 00:22:49,060
Why can't my family attend her wedding?

698
00:22:49,450 --> 00:22:50,940
Just because it's held at Lijun Hotel?

699
00:22:51,140 --> 00:22:52,740
Is Lijun Hotel owned by your family?

700
00:22:53,300 --> 00:22:54,380
Is there a lock or a curfew?

701
00:22:54,380 --> 00:22:54,980
Shen Minghui!

702
00:22:54,980 --> 00:22:56,180
Are you going to stop every guest
who is not from the Feng family?

703
00:22:56,180 --> 00:22:56,860
Shen Minghui!

704
00:22:56,860 --> 00:22:58,300
Listen to me. Let's go back.

705
00:22:58,300 --> 00:22:59,700
You are so uneducated.

706
00:23:01,500 --> 00:23:03,260
The wedding can be cancelled

707
00:23:03,700 --> 00:23:05,140
but your sister is pregnant.

708
00:23:05,380 --> 00:23:06,260
Just cancel it!

709
00:23:06,560 --> 00:23:07,860
Many people are after my sister!

710
00:23:07,860 --> 00:23:08,860
Just find someone else!

711
00:23:08,870 --> 00:23:10,500
The child
will call someone else his father!

712
00:23:10,500 --> 00:23:10,980
Shen Minghui.

713
00:23:10,980 --> 00:23:11,740
What are you talking about?

714
00:23:11,740 --> 00:23:13,140
- Don't touch me!
- I'll beat you up!

715
00:23:13,140 --> 00:23:14,500
Jianqi!

716
00:23:14,820 --> 00:23:15,580
Are you all right?

717
00:23:17,060 --> 00:23:17,820
You are bleeding.

718
00:23:17,820 --> 00:23:18,580
Go upstairs!

719
00:23:18,780 --> 00:23:20,580
Why did you hit him?

720
00:23:20,590 --> 00:23:22,020
- Why did you hit him?
- Are you all right?

721
00:23:22,020 --> 00:23:22,700
I'm fine.

722
00:23:22,700 --> 00:23:23,740
Jianqi, you are bleeding.

723
00:23:23,740 --> 00:23:24,260
Are you all right?

724
00:23:24,260 --> 00:23:24,940
Who are you?

725
00:23:24,940 --> 00:23:26,180
Why did you hit him?

726
00:23:26,300 --> 00:23:26,980
Jianqi!

727
00:23:26,980 --> 00:23:28,080
Come home with me.

728
00:23:28,080 --> 00:23:29,580
We don't want that child. Divorce her!

729
00:23:29,580 --> 00:23:31,460
- Mom.
- Mrs. Feng, what are you saying?

730
00:23:31,460 --> 00:23:33,580
Who are you calling? I don't know you!
Don't address me.

731
00:23:33,580 --> 00:23:35,180
I don't know you. It's all your fault.

732
00:23:35,180 --> 00:23:36,500
Is that how you talk?

733
00:23:36,500 --> 00:23:37,140
Stop talking.

734
00:23:37,140 --> 00:23:37,580
Mrs. Feng.

735
00:23:37,580 --> 00:23:38,540
Come home with me.

736
00:23:38,540 --> 00:23:39,300
No.

737
00:23:39,300 --> 00:23:40,220
I'll ask you again.

738
00:23:40,220 --> 00:23:41,260
Come home with me.

739
00:23:41,420 --> 00:23:42,060
No!

740
00:23:42,060 --> 00:23:43,140
Fine.

741
00:23:43,140 --> 00:23:44,100
Just stay here!

742
00:23:44,100 --> 00:23:45,380
Stay here!

743
00:23:45,380 --> 00:23:45,940
Let's go!

744
00:23:45,940 --> 00:23:47,660
Why are you so uneducated?

745
00:23:47,660 --> 00:23:48,100
That's enough.

746
00:23:48,100 --> 00:23:50,220
I've never seen a mother like you!

747
00:23:50,220 --> 00:23:51,940
I've been holding back
the entire morning!

748
00:23:51,940 --> 00:23:53,980
You are just a hag! Look at all of you!

749
00:23:53,980 --> 00:23:55,420
Who do you think you are?

750
00:23:55,420 --> 00:23:56,900
You're just pretending to be civilized!

751
00:23:56,900 --> 00:23:57,900
You are impossible!

752
00:23:57,900 --> 00:23:59,260
Enough! Stand right here!

753
00:23:59,260 --> 00:24:00,460
You are being unreasonable!

754
00:24:00,740 --> 00:24:01,620
Are you all right?

755
00:24:01,620 --> 00:24:03,020
Report to the police! We'll be waiting!

756
00:24:03,020 --> 00:24:04,500
Dad!

757
00:24:04,500 --> 00:24:05,220
Are you all right?

758
00:24:05,220 --> 00:24:06,660
I'm fine! Go back!

759
00:24:06,660 --> 00:24:07,740
They are so uncultured.

760
00:24:07,740 --> 00:24:08,380
I'm telling you.

761
00:24:08,380 --> 00:24:09,900
What kind of family is this?

762
00:24:09,910 --> 00:24:10,740
- Sorry.
- I'm telling you.

763
00:24:10,740 --> 00:24:11,820
I won't come back again.

764
00:24:11,820 --> 00:24:12,900
Let's go.

765
00:24:12,900 --> 00:24:13,740
What's happened?

766
00:24:13,740 --> 00:24:14,620
What's going on?

767
00:24:14,620 --> 00:24:15,980
- Exactly.
- That's too much.

768
00:24:15,980 --> 00:24:16,460
No.

769
00:24:16,460 --> 00:24:17,300
Mr. Feng!

770
00:24:17,500 --> 00:24:18,420
Shen has come out.

771
00:24:19,620 --> 00:24:21,380
The child...

772
00:24:22,540 --> 00:24:23,740
Feng.

773
00:24:24,060 --> 00:24:25,820
Don't take his words to heart.

774
00:24:25,820 --> 00:24:27,420
He's too reckless.

775
00:24:28,500 --> 00:24:29,060
Well...

776
00:24:29,060 --> 00:24:29,580
Quick.

777
00:24:29,580 --> 00:24:30,300
Make way.

778
00:24:30,300 --> 00:24:31,180
Why are they leaving?

779
00:24:31,180 --> 00:24:32,700
Sure. Don't be angry.

780
00:24:33,260 --> 00:24:34,380
Why are they angry?

781
00:24:34,380 --> 00:24:34,980
Well...

782
00:24:34,980 --> 00:24:36,140
What's wrong, Shen?

783
00:24:36,140 --> 00:24:37,300
What happened, Shen?

784
00:24:37,500 --> 00:24:39,380
Shen, what happened?

785
00:24:39,380 --> 00:24:40,340
What's going on?

786
00:24:40,340 --> 00:24:41,780
Shen, that was your in-laws.

787
00:24:46,700 --> 00:24:47,540
Time to eat!

788
00:24:48,453 --> 00:24:49,053
Come.

789
00:24:51,300 --> 00:24:51,980
Mom,

790
00:24:52,380 --> 00:24:53,960
if you agree to let me keep a puppy,

791
00:24:53,960 --> 00:24:55,860
I'll agree to you
giving birth to a second baby.

792
00:24:56,660 --> 00:24:57,700
Thanks a lot.

793
00:24:57,980 --> 00:24:58,940
You're welcome.

794
00:24:59,300 --> 00:25:00,780
The kind of dog Wang Ziqian has

795
00:25:00,780 --> 00:25:01,620
is good enough.

796
00:25:03,388 --> 00:25:05,410
I did my best to give birth
and raise my daughter.

797
00:25:05,700 --> 00:25:07,820
I brought her up

798
00:25:08,020 --> 00:25:09,900
just to let her ask me to keep a dog.

799
00:25:10,500 --> 00:25:11,700
I agree.

800
00:25:12,260 --> 00:25:13,380
I like dogs too.

801
00:25:13,380 --> 00:25:14,660
You are the best.

802
00:25:15,260 --> 00:25:16,460
Your father agrees.

803
00:25:16,470 --> 00:25:17,640
I'll leave if the dog is here.

804
00:25:19,820 --> 00:25:20,500
Jiao,

805
00:25:20,940 --> 00:25:23,180
your mother is right
not to let you keep a dog.

806
00:25:23,780 --> 00:25:26,420
Keeping a pet means taking responsibility
for its whole life.

807
00:25:26,420 --> 00:25:28,060
Before you are prepared for that,

808
00:25:28,060 --> 00:25:29,100
you should be careful.

809
00:25:29,100 --> 00:25:30,980
You are helping your wife instead of me.

810
00:25:30,980 --> 00:25:32,460
Of course, I'm helping my wife.

811
00:25:32,740 --> 00:25:34,540
My wife is our family's commander.

812
00:25:34,660 --> 00:25:35,660
That's right, Commander.

813
00:25:35,960 --> 00:25:37,820
Why are you always
comparing yourself to a dog?

814
00:25:39,700 --> 00:25:41,780
Is there a commander as sad as I am?

815
00:25:42,660 --> 00:25:43,660
No one in the family

816
00:25:43,660 --> 00:25:44,620
makes me feel relieved.

817
00:25:44,620 --> 00:25:46,020
I have to worry about them.

818
00:25:46,460 --> 00:25:49,060
I live worse than a dog
in my middle age.

819
00:25:50,740 --> 00:25:52,660
Wang Ziqian's dog even goes to a spa.

820
00:25:53,340 --> 00:25:55,540
When have I done that in my life?

821
00:25:55,860 --> 00:25:57,660
It costs 1,000 yuan once.

822
00:25:58,180 --> 00:25:59,660
I only paid 48 yuan for my haircut.

823
00:25:59,860 --> 00:26:01,140
I want to become Wang Ziqian.

824
00:26:02,500 --> 00:26:03,740
So, I can take care of you.

825
00:26:04,820 --> 00:26:06,060
I'm not as good as you.

826
00:26:06,380 --> 00:26:08,020
My haircut is only 15 yuan.

827
00:26:08,020 --> 00:26:09,950
Why are both of you
comparing yourselves to dogs?

828
00:26:17,180 --> 00:26:18,260
What are you thinking about?

829
00:26:19,540 --> 00:26:20,260
My mother

830
00:26:21,180 --> 00:26:23,580
is asking me to find
my younger sister again.

831
00:26:23,860 --> 00:26:24,780
How can I find her

832
00:26:24,780 --> 00:26:26,260
when there are so many people?

833
00:26:27,540 --> 00:26:29,700
I helped you post on the internet.

834
00:26:29,860 --> 00:26:31,660
It's like casting a huge net.

835
00:26:33,660 --> 00:26:34,860
Look at me.

836
00:26:36,060 --> 00:26:37,360
I have to take care of my husband

837
00:26:38,100 --> 00:26:39,260
and serve my child.

838
00:26:40,180 --> 00:26:41,140
I need to work.

839
00:26:42,160 --> 00:26:43,760
I also need to find my younger sister.

840
00:26:44,300 --> 00:26:46,140
I'm also pregnant with my second child.

841
00:26:47,418 --> 00:26:48,543
My life is so tough.

842
00:26:50,260 --> 00:26:51,900
Do you think I should give birth or not?

843
00:26:51,900 --> 00:26:53,340
Let's raise our hands to vote.

844
00:26:54,340 --> 00:26:55,380
I'm the first to agree.

845
00:26:57,040 --> 00:26:59,020
Are you going to agree
if she lets you keep a dog?

846
00:26:59,260 --> 00:27:00,890
That means
she has abstained from voting.

847
00:27:00,900 --> 00:27:01,820
I've decided.

848
00:27:02,020 --> 00:27:02,900
I agree as well.

849
00:27:04,460 --> 00:27:06,500
You change your mind so quickly.

850
00:27:06,700 --> 00:27:07,660
I've thought about it.

851
00:27:07,710 --> 00:27:10,180
If you give birth to another baby,
he wants to keep a dog too.

852
00:27:10,460 --> 00:27:11,660
Then, it'll be two against two.

853
00:27:12,300 --> 00:27:13,300
Ganging up now?

854
00:27:14,700 --> 00:27:16,500
Yes. We love you together.

855
00:27:17,420 --> 00:27:18,260
I love you.

856
00:27:18,540 --> 00:27:19,740
The baby loves you.

857
00:27:19,940 --> 00:27:21,100
The puppy loves you.

858
00:27:21,340 --> 00:27:22,380
Dad loves you.

859
00:27:22,740 --> 00:27:23,860
Grandfather loves you.

860
00:27:24,020 --> 00:27:25,300
Grandmother loves you.

861
00:27:25,780 --> 00:27:26,860
Uncle loves you.

862
00:27:27,780 --> 00:27:28,460
Mom,

863
00:27:28,620 --> 00:27:30,460
you have so much love.

864
00:27:31,300 --> 00:27:33,300
You have so much love.

865
00:27:37,660 --> 00:27:38,460
Why don't I feel

866
00:27:38,460 --> 00:27:39,940
my parents love me a lot?

867
00:27:40,580 --> 00:27:42,340
I also don't think
your brother loves you.

868
00:27:42,820 --> 00:27:43,460
Jiao,

869
00:27:43,860 --> 00:27:45,700
why am I ranked behind the dog?

870
00:27:46,860 --> 00:27:48,660
Your life is worse than a dog's.

871
00:27:51,460 --> 00:27:54,140
(A harmonious family brings prosperity)

872
00:27:54,740 --> 00:27:55,500
Minghui!

873
00:27:56,100 --> 00:27:57,260
Did you find any clothes?

874
00:27:57,580 --> 00:27:58,580
I did!

875
00:27:59,660 --> 00:28:01,380
Can I wear them?

876
00:28:01,580 --> 00:28:02,860
You have to no matter what.

877
00:28:03,700 --> 00:28:04,940
Do you want to be naked?

878
00:28:05,660 --> 00:28:07,260
Help bring it to me then.

879
00:28:14,820 --> 00:28:16,100
I left it at the door.

880
00:28:16,220 --> 00:28:17,420
Come out and take it yourself.

881
00:28:18,060 --> 00:28:19,620
How can I get it if you put it outside?

882
00:28:19,620 --> 00:28:20,980
I'm naked.

883
00:28:21,580 --> 00:28:22,900
You're on your own.

884
00:28:22,900 --> 00:28:23,420
Minghui.

885
00:28:23,420 --> 00:28:24,540
It's none of my business.

886
00:28:25,380 --> 00:28:25,980
It hurts.

887
00:28:25,980 --> 00:28:27,780
Are you bullying
your brother-in-law again?

888
00:28:27,780 --> 00:28:29,950
I haven't punished you
for what happened this morning.

889
00:28:30,220 --> 00:28:31,980
I dare not bully him.

890
00:28:34,140 --> 00:28:36,380
I'm waiting for you to give it to him.

891
00:28:36,780 --> 00:28:38,500
Do you want to be beaten up again?

892
00:28:38,500 --> 00:28:39,380
I'm leaving.

893
00:28:53,820 --> 00:28:55,180
Happiness in my family?

894
00:28:56,380 --> 00:28:57,180
Your brother

895
00:28:57,180 --> 00:28:59,220
knows how to pick a shirt.

896
00:29:00,140 --> 00:29:00,850
What do you think?

897
00:29:01,877 --> 00:29:03,197
You look good in anything.

898
00:29:04,380 --> 00:29:06,940
Why doesn't your brother
want me to stay at your house?

899
00:29:06,940 --> 00:29:08,100
What is he thinking about?

900
00:29:08,900 --> 00:29:10,940
I'm going to stay here.

901
00:29:10,940 --> 00:29:12,560
I want
to become a matrilocal son-in-law.

902
00:29:12,570 --> 00:29:13,950
I'm going to marry into your family.

903
00:29:14,980 --> 00:29:16,300
Wear your pants.

904
00:29:36,940 --> 00:29:38,060
What happened at the company?

905
00:29:38,060 --> 00:29:40,140
Why did Wang summon you so urgently?

906
00:29:42,730 --> 00:29:44,715
The color of a batch of sweaters
was wrongly sent.

907
00:29:45,420 --> 00:29:47,220
We had a meeting
to discuss it until now.

908
00:29:47,700 --> 00:29:48,740
What is he doing usually?

909
00:29:48,740 --> 00:29:50,180
He's not serious at work.

910
00:29:52,740 --> 00:29:53,780
Jianqi hasn't come back?

911
00:29:53,780 --> 00:29:54,380
No.

912
00:29:55,020 --> 00:29:56,720
I'm sure he's living
with the Shen family.

913
00:30:00,380 --> 00:30:01,460
Call him and ask around.

914
00:30:01,460 --> 00:30:02,180
No.

915
00:30:03,340 --> 00:30:04,020
Why should I?

916
00:30:04,020 --> 00:30:05,900
Why must I call him?

917
00:30:06,580 --> 00:30:08,780
He doesn't want to stay in a big house

918
00:30:09,060 --> 00:30:12,060
and move to an old, decrepit house

919
00:30:12,060 --> 00:30:13,580
without a stable power supply.

920
00:30:14,540 --> 00:30:15,740
Whatever.

921
00:30:16,660 --> 00:30:18,820
Just wait. He'll cry.

922
00:30:19,780 --> 00:30:21,300
Does your nose still hurt?

923
00:30:22,220 --> 00:30:22,940
No.

924
00:30:22,980 --> 00:30:24,500
Your brother didn't do it on purpose.

925
00:30:27,980 --> 00:30:28,660
Dear.

926
00:30:29,380 --> 00:30:31,300
My parents were too much.

927
00:30:31,940 --> 00:30:33,940
I apologize to you on their behalf.

928
00:30:35,660 --> 00:30:36,860
Why should you apologize?

929
00:30:36,860 --> 00:30:38,580
They even left their son with me.

930
00:30:39,980 --> 00:30:41,580
You are right.

931
00:30:41,900 --> 00:30:43,140
You should thank me.

932
00:30:43,970 --> 00:30:46,960
♪And the light breeze that passes by♪

933
00:30:46,980 --> 00:30:48,160
Will your parents blame me

934
00:30:48,260 --> 00:30:49,660
for causing you to stay here?

935
00:30:50,060 --> 00:30:51,140
Of course, they will.

936
00:30:51,660 --> 00:30:52,660
What should I do?

937
00:30:53,420 --> 00:30:54,300
Don't worry.

938
00:30:55,340 --> 00:30:57,180
I will always be on your side.

939
00:30:57,180 --> 00:30:58,140
It's two against two.

940
00:30:58,980 --> 00:30:59,820
What next?

941
00:31:00,420 --> 00:31:01,860
When you give birth,

942
00:31:01,860 --> 00:31:03,220
we'll have three people.

943
00:31:03,220 --> 00:31:04,180
Three against two.

944
00:31:05,100 --> 00:31:06,300
You're going to win with this?

945
00:31:06,300 --> 00:31:06,940
Yes.

946
00:31:07,540 --> 00:31:09,060
Then, we'll keep giving birth.

947
00:31:09,540 --> 00:31:10,460
A crowded tactic.

948
00:31:10,460 --> 00:31:11,540
We'll go three against two,

949
00:31:11,540 --> 00:31:13,540
four against two, and five against two.

950
00:31:13,940 --> 00:31:17,180
We'll give birth to a basketball team
while chasing for a football team.

951
00:31:17,180 --> 00:31:19,550
- What do you think?
- Do you want to exhaust me to death?

952
00:31:21,860 --> 00:31:22,900
But I believe

953
00:31:23,620 --> 00:31:25,780
the baby can overcome every difficulty.

954
00:31:27,820 --> 00:31:28,700
Baby,

955
00:31:29,180 --> 00:31:30,780
we'll depend on you in the future

956
00:31:30,780 --> 00:31:32,740
to please your grandparents.

957
00:31:34,900 --> 00:31:35,620
Well,

958
00:31:36,180 --> 00:31:38,020
life is really amazing.

959
00:31:39,060 --> 00:31:41,500
Our genes are passed on
through the chromosomes in our cells

960
00:31:42,380 --> 00:31:44,340
but it is also an individual

961
00:31:44,660 --> 00:31:45,940
who has their own thoughts.

962
00:31:47,220 --> 00:31:50,140
Perhaps he won't listen to us at all
in the future.

963
00:31:50,820 --> 00:31:52,060
It's highly possible.

964
00:31:52,300 --> 00:31:53,300
Just like me.

965
00:31:54,100 --> 00:31:55,140
I'll hit his butt.

966
00:31:55,140 --> 00:31:56,020
Don't do it.

967
00:31:56,020 --> 00:31:56,620
Dear,

968
00:31:56,980 --> 00:31:58,380
you mustn't do that.

969
00:32:01,020 --> 00:32:02,740
Give the baby a name.

970
00:32:04,420 --> 00:32:05,420
I've thought about it.

971
00:32:06,540 --> 00:32:08,180
If we give birth to a boy,

972
00:32:08,180 --> 00:32:09,740
we'll call him Xiangru.

973
00:32:09,960 --> 00:32:11,860
If we give birth to a girl,
we'll call her Yimo.

974
00:32:12,180 --> 00:32:12,900
What do you think?

975
00:32:13,380 --> 00:32:15,540
Xiangru and Yimo.
[*Profound feelings]

976
00:32:16,820 --> 00:32:18,020
Nice names.

977
00:32:19,540 --> 00:32:21,180
Both contain the water radical

978
00:32:21,180 --> 00:32:22,340
to show genes.

979
00:32:22,940 --> 00:32:23,860
Back then,

980
00:32:23,960 --> 00:32:26,350
I was the freestyle swimming champion
of Nanzhou University.

981
00:32:27,340 --> 00:32:28,700
My nickname

982
00:32:28,700 --> 00:32:30,540
of "Wave Jumping White"
isn't just for show.

983
00:32:31,620 --> 00:32:33,940
After getting married,

984
00:32:34,900 --> 00:32:36,740
I have no choice but to stay in bed.

985
00:32:37,500 --> 00:32:38,540
Darn you!

986
00:32:38,540 --> 00:32:39,420
It's itchy.

987
00:32:40,700 --> 00:32:41,980
(English)
Take note of prenatal education!

988
00:32:44,620 --> 00:32:47,020
That's right. Prenatal education.

989
00:32:48,300 --> 00:32:48,900
Dear,

990
00:32:49,420 --> 00:32:49,980
swimming

991
00:32:49,980 --> 00:32:51,700
is very good for a pregnant lady.

992
00:32:52,127 --> 00:32:53,585
Let's go do it one day.

993
00:32:53,860 --> 00:32:55,220
I approve.

994
00:32:55,220 --> 00:32:56,860
As Shackleton

995
00:32:57,380 --> 00:33:01,980
and his boat
sailed away from Elephant...

996
00:33:01,980 --> 00:33:04,580
Minghui's English is...

997
00:33:05,960 --> 00:33:07,220
His English cannot be understood

998
00:33:07,220 --> 00:33:08,220
by both foreigners

999
00:33:08,220 --> 00:33:09,500
and Chinese.

1000
00:33:12,220 --> 00:33:13,220
Feng Jianqi!

1001
00:33:13,860 --> 00:33:15,420
Do you know English?

1002
00:33:15,900 --> 00:33:17,340
Do you understand?

1003
00:33:20,020 --> 00:33:21,100
It's understand.

1004
00:33:21,100 --> 00:33:23,180
Not ander-stand.

1005
00:33:25,340 --> 00:33:26,460
Feng Jianqi!

1006
00:33:27,100 --> 00:33:30,020
You can shut up or get out!

1007
00:33:31,140 --> 00:33:31,740
Seriously.

1008
00:33:31,740 --> 00:33:33,340
He is fluent when it comes to scolding.

1009
00:33:33,860 --> 00:33:34,620
Shen Minghui,

1010
00:33:34,980 --> 00:33:36,140
return me my red packet.

1011
00:33:41,060 --> 00:33:41,740
Dear,

1012
00:33:43,540 --> 00:33:45,340
I think Minghui is studying.

1013
00:33:45,580 --> 00:33:46,740
We shouldn't disturb him.

1014
00:33:46,740 --> 00:33:48,220
We must seal our mouths

1015
00:33:48,580 --> 00:33:49,420
and not affect him.

1016
00:33:50,700 --> 00:33:52,380
How?

1017
00:33:58,020 --> 00:33:58,740
Like this.

1018
00:34:11,420 --> 00:34:12,220
No.

1019
00:34:12,500 --> 00:34:13,180
What's wrong?

1020
00:34:13,180 --> 00:34:14,740
The safety period isn't over yet.

1021
00:34:14,740 --> 00:34:16,940
I know.

1022
00:34:17,060 --> 00:34:17,700
I just

1023
00:34:18,220 --> 00:34:19,660
want to kiss you.

1024
00:34:21,060 --> 00:34:22,700
I like kissing my wife.

1025
00:34:25,900 --> 00:34:28,900
(Shen's Restaurant)

1026
00:34:30,100 --> 00:34:31,740
Tidy up and let's eat.

1027
00:34:33,540 --> 00:34:34,420
This time,

1028
00:34:34,740 --> 00:34:36,740
we've completely offended Feng's family.

1029
00:34:37,700 --> 00:34:38,620
That's better.

1030
00:34:39,460 --> 00:34:40,900
Look at his mother.

1031
00:34:41,140 --> 00:34:42,980
She is so arrogant.

1032
00:34:43,340 --> 00:34:45,260
Did you see
how she spoke with our daughter?

1033
00:34:45,460 --> 00:34:47,100
Our daughter
hasn't been treated this way

1034
00:34:47,100 --> 00:34:48,300
since she was young.

1035
00:34:48,620 --> 00:34:49,620
They aren't married yet.

1036
00:34:49,620 --> 00:34:51,820
If they are married,
she will surely suffer.

1037
00:34:52,180 --> 00:34:53,180
What should we do?

1038
00:34:54,180 --> 00:34:55,820
The children are getting along well.

1039
00:34:56,460 --> 00:34:58,140
We can't just cancel the wedding

1040
00:34:58,660 --> 00:35:00,500
because of this.

1041
00:35:02,300 --> 00:35:03,540
What should we do?

1042
00:35:05,580 --> 00:35:06,300
What?

1043
00:35:07,060 --> 00:35:08,580
If nothing works, we'll choose a date

1044
00:35:08,960 --> 00:35:10,160
and organize our own wedding.

1045
00:35:10,860 --> 00:35:12,620
Yes. Forget about them.

1046
00:35:12,620 --> 00:35:14,020
Let's do it ourselves. Right?

1047
00:35:14,780 --> 00:35:16,300
We might even get some gift money back.

1048
00:35:18,140 --> 00:35:19,620
Is it about gift money?

1049
00:35:21,340 --> 00:35:22,660
It's about our pride.

1050
00:35:23,140 --> 00:35:24,060
I'm telling you.

1051
00:35:24,060 --> 00:35:25,660
Having Jianqi stay here is good.

1052
00:35:25,660 --> 00:35:27,820
A son-in-law is as good as half a son.

1053
00:35:27,820 --> 00:35:28,780
We have nothing to lose.

1054
00:35:28,860 --> 00:35:30,950
Yes. His mother is the one
who has lost something.

1055
00:35:31,140 --> 00:35:32,620
Not so loud. He's around.

1056
00:35:32,780 --> 00:35:33,500
Well...

1057
00:35:34,220 --> 00:35:35,860
Dad. Mom. Good morning.

1058
00:35:36,300 --> 00:35:37,380
Why are you up so early?

1059
00:35:37,380 --> 00:35:38,020
Exactly.

1060
00:35:38,020 --> 00:35:40,050
Minghui has to go to school
and he's still asleep.

1061
00:35:41,140 --> 00:35:41,900
He's still asleep?

1062
00:35:42,140 --> 00:35:42,900
Minghui!

1063
00:35:43,660 --> 00:35:45,180
(Happy Today)
Get up! You'll be late!

1064
00:35:45,180 --> 00:35:46,260
Sleep more.

1065
00:35:46,860 --> 00:35:47,580
He's late.

1066
00:35:47,580 --> 00:35:48,140
I mean

1067
00:35:48,140 --> 00:35:49,780
Jianqi should sleep more.

1068
00:35:50,560 --> 00:35:51,620
- Are you hungry?
- Sit.

1069
00:35:51,660 --> 00:35:53,340
- I'm okay.
- Let me clean up this place.

1070
00:35:53,340 --> 00:35:54,880
- Otherwise, it'll be too dusty.
- Eat.

1071
00:35:55,260 --> 00:35:57,420
We have milk

1072
00:35:57,420 --> 00:35:58,380
and soy milk.

1073
00:35:58,380 --> 00:35:59,780
What do you like?

1074
00:35:59,780 --> 00:36:01,140
I'm fine with anything.

1075
00:36:01,580 --> 00:36:02,140
Let me get it.

1076
00:36:02,140 --> 00:36:03,300
- No.
- Let me clean up.

1077
00:36:03,300 --> 00:36:04,420
Sit.

1078
00:36:04,420 --> 00:36:05,660
Let me get it. Hurry.

1079
00:36:05,960 --> 00:36:07,350
You are fine with eating anything?

1080
00:36:07,660 --> 00:36:08,140
Just wait.

1081
00:36:08,140 --> 00:36:09,140
Unlike our child.

1082
00:36:10,340 --> 00:36:11,340
She's picky.

1083
00:36:12,100 --> 00:36:13,100
Come downstairs!

1084
00:36:13,740 --> 00:36:15,220
A poor family raising a rich child.

1085
00:36:17,500 --> 00:36:18,020
Here you go.

1086
00:36:21,150 --> 00:36:22,340
Did you sleep well last night?

1087
00:36:22,340 --> 00:36:23,180
Was it too cramped?

1088
00:36:23,420 --> 00:36:23,980
Not at all.

1089
00:36:23,980 --> 00:36:24,540
What's wrong?

1090
00:36:25,060 --> 00:36:26,380
Was the bed too small?

1091
00:36:27,060 --> 00:36:29,540
I'm organizing these materials.

1092
00:36:30,180 --> 00:36:31,660
Let me make some changes to the bed.

1093
00:36:32,060 --> 00:36:33,060
I'll make it wider.

1094
00:36:33,060 --> 00:36:34,260
- Yes.
- I'll make a big bed for you.

1095
00:36:34,260 --> 00:36:34,940
Good idea.

1096
00:36:36,980 --> 00:36:38,260
You're getting him a bigger bed?

1097
00:36:38,900 --> 00:36:40,020
Is he leaving?

1098
00:36:40,900 --> 00:36:41,540
What?

1099
00:36:42,940 --> 00:36:45,340
Yes! Your brother-in-law is staying here.

1100
00:36:45,540 --> 00:36:46,660
Do you have any objections?

1101
00:36:55,420 --> 00:36:56,020
Hello.

1102
00:36:56,420 --> 00:36:57,060
Hello.

1103
00:36:57,540 --> 00:36:58,740
I want all of these.

1104
00:36:58,740 --> 00:36:59,340
All right.

1105
00:37:03,620 --> 00:37:07,780
(JR Watches)

1106
00:37:09,460 --> 00:37:11,700
(Company forever,
Love and time will always be together)

1107
00:37:15,918 --> 00:37:16,543
Yang,

1108
00:37:16,900 --> 00:37:18,380
help me check in the guests.

1109
00:37:18,380 --> 00:37:18,980
Sure.

1110
00:37:18,980 --> 00:37:20,560
- Do you have a reservation?
- I don't.

1111
00:37:20,620 --> 00:37:22,380
We have a twin room and a double room.

1112
00:37:22,380 --> 00:37:23,540
Which one do you need?

1113
00:37:23,540 --> 00:37:24,780
Give me a twin room.

1114
00:37:24,780 --> 00:37:25,460
Sure.

1115
00:37:25,460 --> 00:37:26,060
Two people?

1116
00:37:26,060 --> 00:37:27,060
Yes. Just a child.

1117
00:37:27,060 --> 00:37:28,020
- Mingzhu.
- Show me your ID.

1118
00:37:28,020 --> 00:37:28,340
Mingzhu.

1119
00:37:28,340 --> 00:37:28,660
OK.

1120
00:37:29,140 --> 00:37:29,540
All right.

1121
00:37:34,500 --> 00:37:36,340
If there are ordinary guests,

1122
00:37:36,340 --> 00:37:37,580
just let them deal with them.

1123
00:37:37,580 --> 00:37:38,700
When you are free,

1124
00:37:38,700 --> 00:37:39,860
you should rest more.

1125
00:37:40,500 --> 00:37:42,300
Leave early after work.

1126
00:37:42,500 --> 00:37:44,460
It's fine, Mr. Zhao.
I don't feel tired at all.

1127
00:37:44,460 --> 00:37:46,660
Moreover, I'll go back
with Jianqi at night.

1128
00:37:47,700 --> 00:37:48,420
That's great.

1129
00:37:49,940 --> 00:37:51,740
I also have another thing to tell you.

1130
00:37:52,660 --> 00:37:53,500
Mr. Feng

1131
00:37:53,820 --> 00:37:54,940
has transferred

1132
00:37:54,940 --> 00:37:57,060
all the receptionists to Nanxi Hotel.

1133
00:37:57,660 --> 00:37:58,660
He said

1134
00:37:58,660 --> 00:38:00,700
he doesn't want promotions

1135
00:38:00,700 --> 00:38:01,500
or vouchers.

1136
00:38:01,500 --> 00:38:02,450
He only said one thing.

1137
00:38:02,860 --> 00:38:04,060
Take good care of Shen Mingzhu.

1138
00:38:05,220 --> 00:38:05,980
Is that so?

1139
00:38:07,060 --> 00:38:07,940
I came to you

1140
00:38:07,940 --> 00:38:08,900
to tell you

1141
00:38:09,380 --> 00:38:10,540
that you must thank Mr. Feng

1142
00:38:10,540 --> 00:38:12,220
when you go back.

1143
00:38:12,900 --> 00:38:13,780
One more thing.

1144
00:38:14,940 --> 00:38:16,180
If it's convenient,

1145
00:38:16,340 --> 00:38:17,700
help me put in a good word

1146
00:38:17,700 --> 00:38:19,820
to Mr. Feng about our hotel.

1147
00:38:20,940 --> 00:38:23,180
It's tough doing this business.

1148
00:38:23,380 --> 00:38:25,060
All the mid-level executives

1149
00:38:25,420 --> 00:38:26,780
are stressed about sales.

1150
00:38:26,780 --> 00:38:28,540
I understand. Don't worry.

1151
00:38:28,540 --> 00:38:30,820
I'll come to you for top-ups.

1152
00:38:31,340 --> 00:38:34,060
See? No wonder you can marry a rich man.

1153
00:38:34,340 --> 00:38:35,260
You have a high EQ.

1154
00:38:35,880 --> 00:38:36,940
I'll go back to work then.

1155
00:38:36,940 --> 00:38:37,540
Sure.

1156
00:38:38,020 --> 00:38:38,980
Rest more.

1157
00:38:38,980 --> 00:38:39,580
Sure.

1158
00:38:40,780 --> 00:38:41,940
Everyone is busy.

1159
00:38:42,660 --> 00:38:45,500
Is everyone eating lunchboxes again?

1160
00:38:45,860 --> 00:38:46,500
Yes.

1161
00:38:46,960 --> 00:38:47,980
I won't be ordering today.

1162
00:38:47,980 --> 00:38:49,140
I've prepared a feast.

1163
00:38:50,060 --> 00:38:51,460
A feast?

1164
00:38:59,260 --> 00:39:00,820
It's a feast indeed.

1165
00:39:01,420 --> 00:39:03,380
This is a good lunchbox.

1166
00:39:03,900 --> 00:39:05,380
My father-in-law opens a restaurant.

1167
00:39:05,380 --> 00:39:06,500
He prepared them for me.

1168
00:39:06,700 --> 00:39:08,300
I also want a father-in-law like him.

1169
00:39:08,620 --> 00:39:09,340
Count me in.

1170
00:39:09,820 --> 00:39:11,300
Sorry, you are late.

1171
00:39:11,860 --> 00:39:12,660
My father-in-law

1172
00:39:12,660 --> 00:39:14,340
only has one daughter.

1173
00:39:14,460 --> 00:39:15,700
She's Mrs. Feng now.

1174
00:39:16,660 --> 00:39:18,700
Feng married the daughter
of a restaurant owner.

1175
00:39:19,060 --> 00:39:20,140
Ever since,

1176
00:39:20,340 --> 00:39:22,100
he has achieved the pinnacle in life.

1177
00:39:23,180 --> 00:39:24,700
Let us try it as well.

1178
00:39:24,700 --> 00:39:25,620
Next time.

1179
00:39:25,860 --> 00:39:27,060
This is specially made

1180
00:39:27,060 --> 00:39:29,340
by my father-in-law.

1181
00:39:30,100 --> 00:39:31,580
Are you trying to tease us on purpose?

1182
00:39:34,700 --> 00:39:36,540
How is it? Is it delicious?

1183
00:39:43,340 --> 00:39:45,020
It's incredible.

1184
00:39:49,660 --> 00:39:50,700
(Forever in our memories )

1185
00:39:50,700 --> 00:39:52,020
Mom,

1186
00:39:52,300 --> 00:39:55,060
if you have any clues,

1187
00:39:55,500 --> 00:39:57,100
remember to tell me in my dreams.

1188
00:40:10,060 --> 00:40:10,780
Hello.

1189
00:40:12,140 --> 00:40:12,900
Yes.

1190
00:40:13,540 --> 00:40:15,060
Yes. We are looking for someone.

1191
00:40:15,060 --> 00:40:15,820
You are...

1192
00:40:19,980 --> 00:40:20,940
Our caretakers

1193
00:40:20,940 --> 00:40:22,300
are very experienced.

1194
00:40:22,580 --> 00:40:25,340
Our VIP wards and the delivery room
are combined.

1195
00:40:25,340 --> 00:40:26,780
We have constant temperature, humidity,
and also a constant level of care.

1196
00:40:26,780 --> 00:40:28,660
Our postpartum caregiver
is also working around the clock.

1197
00:40:28,660 --> 00:40:29,900
They can provide the utmost care

1198
00:40:29,900 --> 00:40:31,180
to the baby and his mother.

1199
00:40:31,940 --> 00:40:32,660
Well...

1200
00:40:32,660 --> 00:40:33,740
Can you give me

1201
00:40:33,740 --> 00:40:35,300
the premium pregnancy set's information

1202
00:40:35,300 --> 00:40:36,020
to me?

1203
00:40:36,020 --> 00:40:36,580
Sure.

1204
00:40:37,460 --> 00:40:38,100
Thank you.

1205
00:40:42,280 --> 00:40:43,980
Give me the information
on the premium abortion set

1206
00:40:43,980 --> 00:40:45,020
as well.

1207
00:40:45,860 --> 00:40:48,220
We don't need that.

1208
00:40:49,500 --> 00:40:50,740
Are you the one giving birth?

1209
00:40:54,580 --> 00:40:56,980
You'll give birth
and I'll raise the baby.

1210
00:41:01,140 --> 00:41:03,180
Get a bigger house for the baby then.

1211
00:41:05,900 --> 00:41:08,300
How is that related to this?

1212
00:41:08,900 --> 00:41:10,740
The baby is young.

1213
00:41:10,740 --> 00:41:11,820
He won't mind.

1214
00:41:12,140 --> 00:41:13,860
The big baby, Jiao, cares about that.

1215
00:41:14,620 --> 00:41:16,140
She needs her own space.

1216
00:41:17,100 --> 00:41:18,280
Why don't we do it like this?

1217
00:41:18,860 --> 00:41:20,580
You'll raise the child.

1218
00:41:20,820 --> 00:41:21,900
I'll take Jiao

1219
00:41:22,100 --> 00:41:22,820
and find her

1220
00:41:22,820 --> 00:41:24,620
a father who can provide us
with a big house.

1221
00:41:27,900 --> 00:41:29,380
Can you get me another glass of water?

1222
00:41:29,580 --> 00:41:30,220
Sure.

1223
00:41:32,820 --> 00:41:33,740
This has nothing to do

1224
00:41:33,740 --> 00:41:35,220
with finding a father

1225
00:41:35,220 --> 00:41:36,440
who can get her a bigger house?

1226
00:41:36,620 --> 00:41:37,820
Does Jiao need another father?

1227
00:41:37,820 --> 00:41:39,380
Jiao needs a dog.

1228
00:41:40,440 --> 00:41:41,820
Don't you need space to keep a dog?

1229
00:41:41,820 --> 00:41:42,380
You do.

1230
00:41:42,740 --> 00:41:45,060
I still need to find a father
who can get me a big house.

1231
00:41:45,060 --> 00:41:46,920
Why do you insist
on finding another father?

1232
00:41:48,480 --> 00:41:49,840
How about finding another mother?

1233
00:41:50,660 --> 00:41:52,020
I can't bear losing you.

1234
00:41:52,020 --> 00:41:52,980
I can't.

1235
00:41:56,580 --> 00:41:57,460
(Premium Abortion Set,
Premium Pregnancy Set)

1236
00:41:57,460 --> 00:42:00,540
See? Giving birth
and not giving birth are both expensive.

1237
00:42:01,340 --> 00:42:03,300
This depends on

1238
00:42:03,480 --> 00:42:05,350
where the scale of your love
is tipping toward.

1239
00:42:05,540 --> 00:42:07,260
Not giving birth is cheaper.

1240
00:42:11,180 --> 00:42:12,100
Let's go to the market.

1241
00:42:13,580 --> 00:42:14,980
There's a sale on eggs today.

1242
00:42:18,820 --> 00:42:19,900
You're so annoying.

1243
00:42:25,500 --> 00:42:26,180
Hello.

1244
00:42:26,180 --> 00:42:27,460
They found...

1245
00:42:27,780 --> 00:42:29,980
They found your younger sister!

1246
00:42:31,620 --> 00:42:32,780
She's in Guangzhou.

1247
00:42:33,180 --> 00:42:34,620
She'll come back tomorrow.

1248
00:42:36,500 --> 00:42:38,780
I gave her 3,000 yuan
in transportation fees.

1249
00:42:40,620 --> 00:42:41,540
Congratulations.

1250
00:42:41,820 --> 00:42:43,180
