(Adapted from iceread.com novel
"You Xi" by Qingyang Wanxi)

00:01:14,980 --> 00:01:17,980
=Episode 26=

4
00:01:24,740 --> 00:01:25,420
(Jianqi,)

5
00:01:26,180 --> 00:01:27,620
(we said we'd play)

6
00:01:27,620 --> 00:01:29,500
(a duet at the wedding.)

7
00:01:30,140 --> 00:01:32,340
(Now, come play it with me.)

8
00:01:33,380 --> 00:01:34,860
(Let's give this happiness)

9
00:01:35,180 --> 00:01:36,980
(to Zhidong and Bichen.)

10
00:01:56,140 --> 00:01:56,760
It's beautiful.

11
00:02:01,500 --> 00:02:05,980
(Xu's Wedding, Mr. Xu and Ms. Yuan)

12
00:02:07,940 --> 00:02:09,460
Thank you for helping me out today.

13
00:02:09,500 --> 00:02:10,700
That was so awkward.

14
00:02:10,700 --> 00:02:12,660
If I'd had to go up there,
it would've been a disaster.

15
00:02:12,960 --> 00:02:13,940
How was my hosting skill?

16
00:02:14,060 --> 00:02:15,020
You were so good.

17
00:02:15,420 --> 00:02:16,460
You play the piano well.

18
00:02:17,460 --> 00:02:18,580
I was just messing around.

19
00:02:20,340 --> 00:02:21,060
They're here.

20
00:02:21,060 --> 00:02:22,340
Dr. Li.

21
00:02:22,340 --> 00:02:24,100
Thank you for everything.

22
00:02:24,100 --> 00:02:24,740
Mingzhu.

23
00:02:24,740 --> 00:02:26,100
You too, Ni.

24
00:02:26,300 --> 00:02:27,260
Come on.

25
00:02:28,300 --> 00:02:29,780
Congratulations on your wedding!

26
00:02:31,980 --> 00:02:32,820
Be good to her.

27
00:02:32,820 --> 00:02:34,650
I will. I'm going to drink
with my parents now.

28
00:02:34,660 --> 00:02:36,380
Mom and Dad!

29
00:02:36,380 --> 00:02:37,180
Mr. and Mrs. Shen.

30
00:02:37,340 --> 00:02:38,260
Uncle and Aunt.

31
00:02:40,380 --> 00:02:41,100
Here's to you.

32
00:02:41,100 --> 00:02:42,340
Yes! Yes!

33
00:02:42,860 --> 00:02:43,900
Congratulations!

34
00:02:43,900 --> 00:02:44,700
Thank you, Mr. Shen.

35
00:02:44,700 --> 00:02:45,460
Thank you, Mrs. Shen.

36
00:02:45,460 --> 00:02:46,300
Drink.

37
00:02:46,820 --> 00:02:47,460
Drink.

38
00:02:49,340 --> 00:02:52,260
Today is a good day.

39
00:02:52,260 --> 00:02:52,900
Yes.

40
00:02:53,660 --> 00:02:54,620
I'm not going

41
00:02:55,860 --> 00:02:56,740
to say much,

42
00:02:57,100 --> 00:02:57,980
it's all in the wine.

43
00:02:57,980 --> 00:02:58,820
Yes, yes.

44
00:02:58,820 --> 00:02:59,250
Bottoms up!

45
00:02:59,260 --> 00:03:00,570
- Easy there, Mom.
- Empty the glass.

46
00:03:00,580 --> 00:03:01,220
Finish it.

47
00:03:01,660 --> 00:03:02,460
Yes, finish it.

48
00:03:02,460 --> 00:03:02,980
Finish it.

49
00:03:04,380 --> 00:03:04,940
Mom,

50
00:03:06,020 --> 00:03:07,500
your cheeks are red. Go easy on it.

51
00:03:07,580 --> 00:03:08,380
I'm okay.

52
00:03:08,380 --> 00:03:09,180
Tell him to go easy too.

53
00:03:09,180 --> 00:03:10,220
Relax.

54
00:03:12,100 --> 00:03:13,820
Let's all sit down.

55
00:03:13,820 --> 00:03:14,780
Let's sit down.

56
00:03:16,900 --> 00:03:17,260
Come on.

57
00:03:18,100 --> 00:03:19,980
Thanks for coming, everyone.

58
00:03:20,140 --> 00:03:21,420
I don't know what to say,

59
00:03:21,740 --> 00:03:23,460
so please enjoy the food.

60
00:03:24,980 --> 00:03:26,860
Xu Dacheng and I

61
00:03:27,060 --> 00:03:28,020
will toast to you.

62
00:03:28,220 --> 00:03:28,820
Yes, we will.

63
00:03:28,820 --> 00:03:29,980
Come on, Xu Dacheng.

64
00:03:31,320 --> 00:03:32,780
They are having quite a lot to drink.

65
00:03:32,780 --> 00:03:34,420
How about I give you a ride home later?

66
00:03:34,430 --> 00:03:35,920
You're not going back to the hospital?

67
00:03:35,980 --> 00:03:36,660
No.

68
00:03:36,820 --> 00:03:37,380
Sure.

69
00:03:38,500 --> 00:03:39,380
Come on.

70
00:03:39,380 --> 00:03:41,220
Cheers!

71
00:03:41,220 --> 00:03:42,340
- Cheers!
- Cheers!

72
00:03:44,100 --> 00:03:44,940
Mrs. Xu,

73
00:03:45,500 --> 00:03:48,340
you're so blessed!
Your son and your daughter are with you.

74
00:03:49,460 --> 00:03:51,100
You're wrong.

75
00:03:51,260 --> 00:03:52,820
Not just one daughter,

76
00:03:52,820 --> 00:03:54,780
two daughters.

77
00:03:55,940 --> 00:03:58,460
I have two daughters and a son.

78
00:03:58,740 --> 00:04:00,860
She's pretty, mature,

79
00:04:00,860 --> 00:04:02,260
and filial.

80
00:04:03,380 --> 00:04:04,540
What are they talking about?

81
00:04:04,700 --> 00:04:06,540
The girl who played the piano earlier,

82
00:04:06,740 --> 00:04:08,180
she's our daughter too.

83
00:04:09,180 --> 00:04:10,540
She's amazing.

84
00:04:10,540 --> 00:04:11,140
Come on.

85
00:04:11,780 --> 00:04:12,500
Shengli,

86
00:04:13,380 --> 00:04:15,740
we must share a drink tonight.

87
00:04:16,260 --> 00:04:16,820
Come on!

88
00:04:18,980 --> 00:04:19,820
Bottoms up!

89
00:04:19,820 --> 00:04:20,620
Yes, finish your glass!

90
00:04:20,620 --> 00:04:22,060
Shengli, finish it!

91
00:04:22,060 --> 00:04:24,020
Come on, drink it.

92
00:04:24,740 --> 00:04:25,140
Drink.

93
00:04:25,140 --> 00:04:26,140
Don't drink it.

94
00:04:26,380 --> 00:04:28,140
You've had enough.

95
00:04:28,140 --> 00:04:28,820
Don't drink it.

96
00:04:29,180 --> 00:04:30,280
You see, someone like me...

97
00:04:30,860 --> 00:04:32,020
Good capacity.

98
00:04:32,380 --> 00:04:33,500
My capacity is average,

99
00:04:35,460 --> 00:04:37,460
but my courage is top three.

100
00:04:38,220 --> 00:04:40,380
And my drinking etiquette
is second to none.

101
00:04:41,740 --> 00:04:42,300
Yes.

102
00:04:42,580 --> 00:04:44,380
You have good capacity
and great courage.

103
00:04:45,380 --> 00:04:46,660
Still, I need to remind you,

104
00:04:46,660 --> 00:04:47,340
Xu Dacheng,

105
00:04:47,940 --> 00:04:50,740
that girl is our daughter.

106
00:04:51,140 --> 00:04:52,980
I know, I know.

107
00:04:54,900 --> 00:04:56,300
Now, I'm not one to criticize,

108
00:04:56,820 --> 00:04:58,900
but you can't let your wife

109
00:04:58,900 --> 00:05:00,140
make all the decisions.

110
00:05:01,260 --> 00:05:02,740
Xiu'e, listen,

111
00:05:03,260 --> 00:05:04,380
a family

112
00:05:04,380 --> 00:05:07,380
must have a man to steer the ship.

113
00:05:07,390 --> 00:05:07,900
That's right.

114
00:05:07,900 --> 00:05:08,500
You're

115
00:05:09,100 --> 00:05:11,940
keeping my friend
here under your control.

116
00:05:12,080 --> 00:05:12,900
Is that appropriate?

117
00:05:13,300 --> 00:05:14,220
Not appropriate.

118
00:05:14,380 --> 00:05:14,940
That's right.

119
00:05:15,220 --> 00:05:18,140
The man handles outside affairs,
the woman manages the home.

120
00:05:18,140 --> 00:05:18,500
Yes.

121
00:05:18,500 --> 00:05:20,500
That's the rule.
It shouldn't be flipped.

122
00:05:20,500 --> 00:05:21,660
That's right.

123
00:05:22,300 --> 00:05:23,660
That's funny.

124
00:05:23,660 --> 00:05:25,260
In our house, it's been flipped

125
00:05:25,260 --> 00:05:27,180
the other way around for years.

126
00:05:28,460 --> 00:05:29,540
And how's life been?

127
00:05:29,540 --> 00:05:30,180
Great.

128
00:05:30,260 --> 00:05:30,980
Great, right?

129
00:05:31,300 --> 00:05:32,660
We're doing great.

130
00:05:32,860 --> 00:05:34,380
No, no.

131
00:05:35,260 --> 00:05:38,060
There are some things women

132
00:05:38,500 --> 00:05:40,380
just can't handle as well as men.

133
00:05:40,380 --> 00:05:40,980
That's right.

134
00:05:40,980 --> 00:05:42,500
You see, in my house,

135
00:05:42,620 --> 00:05:45,220
I have the final say
on every major decision.

136
00:05:45,540 --> 00:05:46,220
That's right.

137
00:05:46,220 --> 00:05:48,020
Don't let her loud voice fool you.

138
00:05:48,500 --> 00:05:50,740
I'm the one backing her up from behind,

139
00:05:50,740 --> 00:05:51,460
you know?

140
00:05:51,620 --> 00:05:52,820
Let me show you something.

141
00:05:52,820 --> 00:05:53,580
That's right.

142
00:05:53,580 --> 00:05:54,540
No, I don't want it.

143
00:05:54,740 --> 00:05:56,060
- Just eat it.
- No.

144
00:05:56,460 --> 00:05:57,140
No.

145
00:06:00,140 --> 00:06:01,220
Look at this.

146
00:06:01,380 --> 00:06:02,820
Look here.

147
00:06:03,620 --> 00:06:04,060
Look here.

148
00:06:07,340 --> 00:06:08,020
You get it now?

149
00:06:08,260 --> 00:06:10,500
I've been holding onto
this for safekeeping.

150
00:06:10,700 --> 00:06:12,860
If she ever found out,
all hell would break loose.

151
00:06:14,360 --> 00:06:15,900
Xu Dacheng, you think you can scare me

152
00:06:15,900 --> 00:06:17,180
with some useless paper?

153
00:06:17,180 --> 00:06:18,380
She's slamming the table.

154
00:06:18,380 --> 00:06:19,300
You've gone too far.

155
00:06:19,300 --> 00:06:19,860
From now on,

156
00:06:19,860 --> 00:06:21,460
stay away from us.

157
00:06:21,820 --> 00:06:23,020
We're done. No more contact!

158
00:06:24,660 --> 00:06:25,940
We're going home, Shen Shengli!

159
00:06:26,020 --> 00:06:26,820
Shen Mingzhu!

160
00:06:27,820 --> 00:06:28,900
You're coming home with us!

161
00:06:29,160 --> 00:06:31,700
Oh, no. My mom just called me by my full name.
It can't be good.

162
00:06:31,700 --> 00:06:33,180
What's wrong, Mrs. Shen?

163
00:06:33,180 --> 00:06:33,780
Mrs. Shen?

164
00:06:34,140 --> 00:06:34,740
Xu...

165
00:06:35,300 --> 00:06:35,780
In-law.

166
00:06:35,780 --> 00:06:37,740
So this is a trap for us.

167
00:06:38,340 --> 00:06:39,020
Coming!

168
00:06:39,780 --> 00:06:40,460
Please excuse us.

169
00:06:41,100 --> 00:06:42,300
- What's going on?
- Come on!

170
00:06:43,380 --> 00:06:44,820
Why are you leaving?

171
00:06:49,260 --> 00:06:51,260
(Shen's Restaurant)
See? Now you've caught a chill.

172
00:06:54,420 --> 00:06:55,700
You rushed out of there so fast.

173
00:06:57,500 --> 00:06:58,140
You see?

174
00:06:59,500 --> 00:07:01,220
They're just treating us like fools!

175
00:07:02,860 --> 00:07:04,580
We even gave them
such a big red envelope.

176
00:07:04,960 --> 00:07:06,500
And you still say I'm the foolish one?

177
00:07:06,500 --> 00:07:07,860
Who's actually being stupid here?

178
00:07:07,860 --> 00:07:10,140
Didn't you see what was going on today?

179
00:07:13,760 --> 00:07:15,950
Getting mixed up with that
family is like asking for trouble.

180
00:07:16,020 --> 00:07:17,180
And that brother of hers,

181
00:07:17,800 --> 00:07:19,260
standing there in front of everyone,

182
00:07:19,420 --> 00:07:20,740
calling her sister.

183
00:07:20,740 --> 00:07:22,100
Her parents were pretending to be drunk.

184
00:07:22,100 --> 00:07:23,220
They had the paternity test

185
00:07:23,820 --> 00:07:25,140
ready all along!

186
00:07:25,140 --> 00:07:26,020
What did I tell you?

187
00:07:26,020 --> 00:07:26,980
It's a setup!

188
00:07:26,980 --> 00:07:29,420
You keep telling me I'm paranoid.

189
00:07:29,420 --> 00:07:30,820
You're the one who's clueless.

190
00:07:30,820 --> 00:07:32,340
Lower your voice.
Mingzhu might hear you.

191
00:07:32,340 --> 00:07:34,060
He keeps saying
"she's their biological child."

192
00:07:34,060 --> 00:07:35,140
So what?

193
00:07:35,140 --> 00:07:37,300
Does it count if you
don't even raise her?

194
00:07:37,300 --> 00:07:38,420
They gave her away!

195
00:07:38,420 --> 00:07:39,660
They didn't want her!

196
00:07:39,660 --> 00:07:41,940
We worked so hard to raise that child!

197
00:07:42,300 --> 00:07:43,980
She's right next door. Keep it down.

198
00:07:47,220 --> 00:07:49,220
Mom, don't be upset.

199
00:07:49,500 --> 00:07:51,340
Drink your medicine
while it's still warm.

200
00:07:55,700 --> 00:07:56,180
Mingzhu,

201
00:07:58,620 --> 00:08:01,420
I know I didn't give birth to you,

202
00:08:02,180 --> 00:08:04,260
but I did raise you.

203
00:08:04,270 --> 00:08:05,300
I can't bear the thought of losing you.

204
00:08:05,300 --> 00:08:07,500
You can't acknowledge them.

205
00:08:07,500 --> 00:08:08,060
You...

206
00:08:08,340 --> 00:08:09,940
That family is no good.

207
00:08:09,940 --> 00:08:10,900
You stay away from them.

208
00:08:10,900 --> 00:08:12,540
We can't win against them,
but we can avoid them, okay?

209
00:08:12,540 --> 00:08:14,820
Okay, I'll do as you say.

210
00:08:15,100 --> 00:08:16,580
We'll all do as you say.

211
00:08:16,580 --> 00:08:17,500
Shut up!

212
00:08:21,020 --> 00:08:22,580
Don't be mad anymore.

213
00:08:22,980 --> 00:08:23,940
(Until someone told me)

214
00:08:24,420 --> 00:08:26,220
(that Flying Tiger Capital plans)

215
00:08:26,700 --> 00:08:28,060
(to sell Wildfire within the year.)

216
00:08:29,220 --> 00:08:31,020
(Who kind of man is Sheng Jiangchuan?)

217
00:08:31,700 --> 00:08:33,420
(I'm sure you've heard of him.)

218
00:08:33,420 --> 00:08:34,930
(His nickname is "Sheng the Wrecker.")

219
00:08:34,940 --> 00:08:36,460
(And how did he get that nickname?)

220
00:08:36,460 --> 00:08:37,700
(By tearing companies apart)

221
00:08:37,700 --> 00:08:39,140
(and sucking them dry.)

222
00:08:43,220 --> 00:08:43,700
Okay.

223
00:08:44,540 --> 00:08:45,140
Sell it.

224
00:08:46,580 --> 00:08:48,180
(No matter how big the company is,)

225
00:08:48,180 --> 00:08:50,260
(once it's in his hands,)

226
00:08:50,260 --> 00:08:52,580
(it won't escape the fate
of being sold off.)

227
00:08:53,340 --> 00:08:55,470
(I heard someone say
I was selling off company)

228
00:08:57,940 --> 00:08:59,220
Who was it?

229
00:08:59,660 --> 00:09:00,260
Zhang.

230
00:09:00,740 --> 00:09:02,060
He was asking about the inventory.

231
00:09:07,460 --> 00:09:08,260
Feng,

232
00:09:09,860 --> 00:09:11,980
are you hiding something from me?

233
00:09:13,700 --> 00:09:14,700
What do you mean?

234
00:09:16,860 --> 00:09:18,580
The bank just texted me

235
00:09:18,580 --> 00:09:19,820
a payment reminder.

236
00:09:24,340 --> 00:09:25,260
It's really nothing.

237
00:09:26,180 --> 00:09:27,380
Once I clear out the inventory,

238
00:09:27,580 --> 00:09:28,700
the problem will be solved.

239
00:09:29,420 --> 00:09:30,020
Don't worry.

240
00:09:30,580 --> 00:09:31,460
Really?

241
00:09:35,220 --> 00:09:36,020
That's good.

242
00:09:36,620 --> 00:09:38,110
Listen, if something really is wrong,

243
00:09:38,780 --> 00:09:40,940
you have to tell me.

244
00:09:41,540 --> 00:09:42,580
We'll face it together.

245
00:09:47,060 --> 00:09:47,740
Lihua,

246
00:09:50,580 --> 00:09:52,260
business is very tough right now.

247
00:09:53,660 --> 00:09:54,700
It's exhausting.

248
00:09:56,270 --> 00:09:57,820
Money isn't so easy
to come by anymore.

249
00:09:59,660 --> 00:10:00,980
From now on, we have

250
00:10:02,080 --> 00:10:03,560
to be more careful with our spending.

251
00:10:05,460 --> 00:10:07,780
I got it.

252
00:10:17,020 --> 00:10:17,660
Listen,

253
00:10:17,660 --> 00:10:19,140
you can only eat the egg white.

254
00:10:19,140 --> 00:10:21,620
No yolk. Your cholesterol
and lipids are high.

255
00:10:21,620 --> 00:10:23,140
Okay, I'll be careful.

256
00:10:23,460 --> 00:10:24,900
Here, Meiqi.

257
00:10:25,620 --> 00:10:26,580
I have no appetite.

258
00:10:26,580 --> 00:10:27,460
What's wrong now?

259
00:10:29,740 --> 00:10:31,900
Today's the last day
of our company assessment.

260
00:10:31,960 --> 00:10:33,550
I'm the only one who
didn't hit the target.

261
00:10:33,780 --> 00:10:34,940
I might get fired soon.

262
00:10:38,140 --> 00:10:39,180
How much more do you need?

263
00:10:40,300 --> 00:10:41,060
A hundred thousand.

264
00:10:44,340 --> 00:10:46,180
Alright. Go to work.

265
00:10:46,980 --> 00:10:48,540
I'll transfer it to you later.

266
00:10:48,820 --> 00:10:49,420
Really?

267
00:10:52,460 --> 00:10:53,700
Thank you, Daddy!

268
00:10:53,700 --> 00:10:55,220
Look at you, so dramatic.

269
00:10:55,580 --> 00:10:58,180
Spending big when I need it the most!

270
00:11:00,020 --> 00:11:00,740
Meiqi,

271
00:11:01,660 --> 00:11:03,720
I can help you get started,
give you a little push.

272
00:11:04,020 --> 00:11:05,460
But the journey ahead is long,

273
00:11:06,080 --> 00:11:07,520
you'll have to walk it on your own.

274
00:11:08,060 --> 00:11:09,020
I got it.

275
00:11:09,020 --> 00:11:09,740
Don't worry.

276
00:11:11,460 --> 00:11:12,500
I'm going to work now..

277
00:11:12,500 --> 00:11:13,020
Okay.

278
00:11:13,420 --> 00:11:14,220
Stay safe.

279
00:11:16,180 --> 00:11:17,060
Thanks, Daddy!

280
00:11:17,860 --> 00:11:18,700
Look at that girl.

281
00:11:19,740 --> 00:11:20,900
Will she

282
00:11:21,140 --> 00:11:22,860
ever grow up?

283
00:11:23,380 --> 00:11:24,020
Bye!

284
00:11:24,020 --> 00:11:25,620
Okay, stay safe!

285
00:11:30,080 --> 00:11:31,850
So the inventory problem's
been taken care of?

286
00:11:36,420 --> 00:11:37,020
More or less.

287
00:11:45,460 --> 00:11:46,500
Morning, Samantha.

288
00:11:47,620 --> 00:11:48,260
Morning.

289
00:11:54,060 --> 00:11:54,700
Meiqi.

290
00:11:55,960 --> 00:11:57,700
Wouldn't it be easier to just
inherit the family business?

291
00:11:57,700 --> 00:11:59,660
Why put yourself through
the grind here with us?

292
00:12:01,140 --> 00:12:03,540
You're the only one
who hasn't hit your numbers.

293
00:12:04,380 --> 00:12:05,560
You're not hurting for money,

294
00:12:05,940 --> 00:12:06,900
but the rest of the team

295
00:12:07,380 --> 00:12:09,060
actually depends on this job

296
00:12:09,380 --> 00:12:10,300
to make a living.

297
00:12:12,500 --> 00:12:14,180
Before I close out today,

298
00:12:15,140 --> 00:12:16,380
I'll hit my KPIs.

299
00:12:33,780 --> 00:12:34,540
Samantha,

300
00:12:35,580 --> 00:12:37,740
Meiqi hit her target.

301
00:12:41,980 --> 00:12:43,140
How did she pull that off?

302
00:12:43,380 --> 00:12:45,860
She topped up 100,000 yuan
on her own membership card.

303
00:12:48,340 --> 00:12:49,620
(Lijun Hotel KPI Performance Sheet)

304
00:12:51,460 --> 00:12:52,340
So she

305
00:12:53,240 --> 00:12:54,700
bought her way into the rankings.

306
00:12:57,380 --> 00:12:58,060
Samantha,

307
00:12:58,460 --> 00:12:59,540
I've completed my KPI.

308
00:13:00,660 --> 00:13:01,180
Not bad.

309
00:13:01,360 --> 00:13:03,060
Catching the train
at the very last minute.

310
00:13:03,060 --> 00:13:04,180
But I'm getting off now.

311
00:13:04,700 --> 00:13:05,900
Here's my resignation letter.

312
00:13:06,940 --> 00:13:08,020
Goodbye, Samantha.

313
00:13:18,380 --> 00:13:19,060
Whose turn is it?

314
00:13:19,780 --> 00:13:20,460
Let's drink!

315
00:13:20,460 --> 00:13:21,620
Cheers!

316
00:13:26,820 --> 00:13:27,500
Let's play!

317
00:13:27,500 --> 00:13:28,100
Come on!

318
00:13:28,580 --> 00:13:29,780
- 15, 20, none.
- 15, 20, 15.

319
00:13:31,580 --> 00:13:32,260
15, 20, 10.

320
00:13:32,260 --> 00:13:32,940
20.

321
00:13:33,940 --> 00:13:34,700
Drink!

322
00:13:34,700 --> 00:13:36,020
I lost. I'll drink.

323
00:13:41,940 --> 00:13:42,980
You have to admit,

324
00:13:42,980 --> 00:13:44,940
money really is a wonderful thing.

325
00:13:45,580 --> 00:13:47,500
Look at a family like ours.

326
00:13:47,500 --> 00:13:48,660
With a rich father behind her,

327
00:13:48,660 --> 00:13:50,380
as soon as Meiqi
topped up her card,

328
00:13:50,380 --> 00:13:52,450
her manager sent her on
a business trip to Shanghai.

329
00:13:52,820 --> 00:13:53,940
If you ask me,

330
00:13:53,940 --> 00:13:55,660
that manager is just so opportunistic.

331
00:13:55,940 --> 00:13:57,700
Meiqi's actually capable on her own.

332
00:13:58,820 --> 00:14:00,300
We're just giving her a boost now.

333
00:14:01,020 --> 00:14:03,500
The road ahead, she'll
have to walk on her own.

334
00:14:06,620 --> 00:14:07,380
Mingzhu.

335
00:14:07,390 --> 00:14:08,900
- Come join us.
- You're back, Mingzhu.

336
00:14:08,900 --> 00:14:09,930
- We've been waiting for you.
- I'm home.

337
00:14:09,940 --> 00:14:11,420
Let's eat.

338
00:14:12,560 --> 00:14:14,700
I brought back some plum
blossom cakes from our hotel.

339
00:14:14,820 --> 00:14:15,660
They're delicious.

340
00:14:15,660 --> 00:14:17,060
I wanted you to try them.

341
00:14:17,060 --> 00:14:18,260
Plum blossom cakes?

342
00:14:18,260 --> 00:14:19,550
- This pastry...
- They look wonderful.

343
00:14:19,940 --> 00:14:21,500
- It's Meiqi's favourite.
- Let's eat.

344
00:14:21,500 --> 00:14:23,140
It's a shame she's on a
business trip to Shanghai.

345
00:14:23,140 --> 00:14:24,260
We'll save some for her.

346
00:14:24,900 --> 00:14:26,340
Didn't she resign?

347
00:14:26,340 --> 00:14:27,930
Why would they send
her on a business trip?

348
00:14:27,940 --> 00:14:28,580
Who?

349
00:14:29,020 --> 00:14:29,780
Resigned?

350
00:14:30,140 --> 00:14:31,300
You didn't know?

351
00:14:31,500 --> 00:14:32,060
No.

352
00:14:32,060 --> 00:14:33,460
How did you find out?

353
00:14:33,740 --> 00:14:35,100
She posted it on her Moments.

354
00:14:35,700 --> 00:14:36,820
On her Moments?

355
00:14:41,700 --> 00:14:42,620
There's nothing here.

356
00:14:42,630 --> 00:14:43,850
Same here. I don't see anything.

357
00:14:46,520 --> 00:14:47,500
(Shanghai, here I come)

358
00:14:51,580 --> 00:14:52,540
Let me see yours.

359
00:14:54,620 --> 00:14:56,300
(Freedom is human nature, and quitting
is my decision. Shanghai, here I come.)

360
00:14:56,940 --> 00:14:58,700
She blocked us.

361
00:15:01,940 --> 00:15:04,300
(Dad)

362
00:15:04,700 --> 00:15:05,600
Someone's calling you.

363
00:15:05,620 --> 00:15:06,420
I have to take this.

364
00:15:06,420 --> 00:15:07,020
Go ahead.

365
00:15:07,540 --> 00:15:08,020
Come on.

366
00:15:08,020 --> 00:15:08,860
Let's keep drinking!

367
00:15:10,260 --> 00:15:10,940
Finish it!

368
00:15:12,940 --> 00:15:13,380
Hello, Dad.

369
00:15:13,460 --> 00:15:14,220
Feng Meiqi!

370
00:15:16,220 --> 00:15:17,100
Listen to me!

371
00:15:18,100 --> 00:15:19,380
I don't care where you are,

372
00:15:20,140 --> 00:15:21,420
I don't care how you do it

373
00:15:21,860 --> 00:15:23,540
I want you to come home right now,

374
00:15:23,900 --> 00:15:25,140
this instant!

375
00:15:33,900 --> 00:15:35,140
So irresponsible!

376
00:15:36,560 --> 00:15:38,100
Absolutely zero sense of responsibility!

377
00:15:45,140 --> 00:15:45,900
Meiqi,

378
00:15:46,900 --> 00:15:47,820
I gave you that money

379
00:15:47,820 --> 00:15:50,340
to help you establish
yourself in your career,

380
00:15:50,900 --> 00:15:53,220
not for you to become some hotel VIP!

381
00:15:53,460 --> 00:15:54,600
What are you showing off for?

382
00:15:54,900 --> 00:15:56,100
Anyone can spend money!

383
00:15:57,020 --> 00:15:58,660
Do you need to study abroad in England

384
00:15:58,660 --> 00:16:00,340
to learn how to spend money?

385
00:16:01,380 --> 00:16:02,340
Do you really

386
00:16:02,340 --> 00:16:04,700
need to quit your job just
to blow 100,000 yuan?

387
00:16:06,540 --> 00:16:07,540
Honey,

388
00:16:08,220 --> 00:16:10,100
when will you grow up

389
00:16:10,940 --> 00:16:11,820
and start sharing

390
00:16:12,180 --> 00:16:14,820
the burden for this family,
for me, for your mother?

391
00:16:16,020 --> 00:16:18,060
What you need right now
isn't ways to spend money.

392
00:16:18,060 --> 00:16:19,700
You need to learn how to earn it,

393
00:16:19,700 --> 00:16:21,020
honey.

394
00:16:22,260 --> 00:16:23,540
That's enough.

395
00:16:23,540 --> 00:16:25,180
You've made her cry.

396
00:16:25,300 --> 00:16:26,740
Why are you being so harsh on her?

397
00:16:27,380 --> 00:16:28,340
We work ourselves

398
00:16:28,340 --> 00:16:29,900
half to death for our kids.

399
00:16:30,380 --> 00:16:31,620
Our son is gone,

400
00:16:31,620 --> 00:16:33,380
and Meiqi is all we have left.

401
00:16:33,380 --> 00:16:35,580
Why should she have to
suffer and endure hardship?

402
00:16:35,580 --> 00:16:36,180
Enough!

403
00:16:37,210 --> 00:16:38,760
She's like this because you spoil her.

404
00:16:43,840 --> 00:16:45,260
And exactly because our son is gone,

405
00:16:47,180 --> 00:16:48,700
Meiqi needs to learn to grow up.

406
00:16:50,820 --> 00:16:51,860
Our family will need her

407
00:16:53,740 --> 00:16:54,900
in the future.

408
00:16:55,440 --> 00:16:57,380
She's just a girl.
What burden is she supposed to carry?

409
00:16:57,380 --> 00:16:58,660
Isn't that what you are for?

410
00:16:58,660 --> 00:16:59,540
We have you.

411
00:17:01,620 --> 00:17:02,580
Where are you going?

412
00:17:03,420 --> 00:17:04,020
Feng?

413
00:17:06,380 --> 00:17:07,260
Feng?

414
00:17:12,500 --> 00:17:13,380
Don't cry.

415
00:17:14,380 --> 00:17:15,580
Alright, don't cry.

416
00:17:32,420 --> 00:17:33,140
Stop crying.

417
00:17:33,140 --> 00:17:35,900
Meiqi, Dad only said those things
for your own good.

418
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:38,580
Think about it, you've got the degree,
you've got the experience.

419
00:17:38,620 --> 00:17:40,340
You can definitely
land something better.

420
00:17:40,340 --> 00:17:41,540
I don't want to find a job!

421
00:17:42,420 --> 00:17:43,300
Why are you yelling?

422
00:17:43,300 --> 00:17:44,810
I'll just find a husband
with a rich family!

423
00:17:44,820 --> 00:17:46,060
One that will shelter me
from hardship and worry,

424
00:17:46,060 --> 00:17:47,660
and give me a family heirloom!

425
00:17:48,100 --> 00:17:49,020
Meiqi...

426
00:17:49,380 --> 00:17:50,060
Hang on,

427
00:17:50,740 --> 00:17:51,900
what's that supposed to mean?

428
00:17:51,900 --> 00:17:52,860
The literal meaning!

429
00:17:52,860 --> 00:17:53,740
It's not English.

430
00:17:53,740 --> 00:17:54,750
What don't you understand?

431
00:17:54,980 --> 00:17:57,100
What kind of nonsense is that?

432
00:18:02,620 --> 00:18:03,220
Mom,

433
00:18:03,620 --> 00:18:06,580
to be honest, I've been walking
on eggshells wearing this bracelet.

434
00:18:06,660 --> 00:18:07,900
I'm giving it back to you now,

435
00:18:08,140 --> 00:18:09,540
so Meiqi won't feel uncomfortable.

436
00:18:09,540 --> 00:18:10,500
Mingzhu...

437
00:18:10,500 --> 00:18:12,020
Meiqi didn't mean that.

438
00:18:12,020 --> 00:18:13,740
- I meant it.
- Don't...

439
00:18:13,740 --> 00:18:15,300
I meant every word of it!

440
00:18:15,300 --> 00:18:16,300
Meiqi...

441
00:18:16,900 --> 00:18:17,980
Why?

442
00:18:17,980 --> 00:18:19,540
Why is it that after Jianqi passed away,

443
00:18:19,540 --> 00:18:21,660
all you care about is your grandson?

444
00:18:22,100 --> 00:18:24,620
You spend so much money on him
without any hesitation,

445
00:18:24,620 --> 00:18:27,420
but you make a huge deal out of
spending 100,000 on me?

446
00:18:28,140 --> 00:18:30,140
Weren't you the ones who said

447
00:18:30,900 --> 00:18:32,580
I was your favorite daughter?

448
00:18:32,580 --> 00:18:35,100
That you'd take care
of me my whole life?

449
00:18:35,660 --> 00:18:37,060
So why?

450
00:18:37,060 --> 00:18:39,620
Why is everything I do wrong now?

451
00:18:39,620 --> 00:18:41,300
Why is it always my fault?

452
00:18:50,820 --> 00:18:52,220
The fault is all mine.

453
00:19:13,900 --> 00:19:14,660
Mingzhu?

454
00:19:15,340 --> 00:19:15,980
Mingzhu.

455
00:19:15,980 --> 00:19:16,340
Mom.

456
00:19:17,980 --> 00:19:19,140
It's raining so heavily.

457
00:19:19,140 --> 00:19:20,660
I've been calling Dad,

458
00:19:20,660 --> 00:19:21,650
but he's not picking up.

459
00:19:22,140 --> 00:19:23,420
I'm getting worried.

460
00:19:23,700 --> 00:19:25,180
I want to go find him in the factory.

461
00:19:25,540 --> 00:19:26,620
I'll go with you.

462
00:19:26,860 --> 00:19:27,500
Okay.

463
00:19:27,500 --> 00:19:27,880
Let's go.

464
00:19:28,960 --> 00:19:30,500
I don't know what's going on with him.

465
00:19:30,500 --> 00:19:31,860
I've been calling.

466
00:19:32,340 --> 00:19:33,380
I...

467
00:19:34,100 --> 00:19:35,940
And he's not answering.

468
00:19:38,460 --> 00:19:39,060
Mom.

469
00:19:39,140 --> 00:19:39,980
You should stay home.

470
00:19:39,980 --> 00:19:41,100
I'll go with Mingzhu instead.

471
00:19:42,740 --> 00:19:44,180
Are you sure?

472
00:19:44,940 --> 00:19:46,060
We'll be fine. Don't worry.

473
00:19:46,140 --> 00:19:48,340
Call me when you find Dad.

474
00:19:48,740 --> 00:19:49,700
Okay, don't worry.

475
00:20:50,260 --> 00:20:50,780
Dad?

476
00:20:50,780 --> 00:20:51,650
Dad, why aren't you...

477
00:20:55,380 --> 00:20:57,460
- Dad!
- Dad!

478
00:20:57,580 --> 00:20:58,420
Are you okay?

479
00:20:58,780 --> 00:20:59,420
- Dad?
- Dad?

480
00:21:00,140 --> 00:21:01,020
What's wrong?

481
00:21:01,220 --> 00:21:01,820
Dad?

482
00:21:05,780 --> 00:21:06,380
Dad?

483
00:21:10,300 --> 00:21:10,900
Hello.

484
00:21:12,260 --> 00:21:13,660
Jianmei Workshop! Hurry!

485
00:21:14,660 --> 00:21:15,220
Dad?

486
00:21:27,060 --> 00:21:29,180
(Forever in our memory
- In loving remembrance)

487
00:22:07,860 --> 00:22:08,460
Dad,

488
00:22:12,380 --> 00:22:14,100
I actually went to Shanghai this time

489
00:22:16,140 --> 00:22:17,620
for an interview.

490
00:22:20,740 --> 00:22:22,140
I passed.

491
00:22:23,620 --> 00:22:26,820
I just wanted to make you proud.

492
00:22:27,900 --> 00:22:30,340
(Forever in our memory)

493
00:22:30,340 --> 00:22:31,540
I'm sorry.

494
00:22:37,740 --> 00:22:39,380
Here, have some water.

495
00:22:39,500 --> 00:22:40,060
Okay.

496
00:22:40,060 --> 00:22:41,620
Thank you.

497
00:22:43,300 --> 00:22:44,420
Oh, Feng,

498
00:22:44,780 --> 00:22:46,660
gone before he was even sixty.

499
00:22:47,700 --> 00:22:49,460
It's so sudden.

500
00:22:51,900 --> 00:22:55,660
How will the family manage now?

501
00:22:56,580 --> 00:22:59,380
Nothing but misfortune
for the Fengs lately.

502
00:23:01,060 --> 00:23:01,780
Good thing

503
00:23:02,580 --> 00:23:04,460
Feng did business for so many years,

504
00:23:04,620 --> 00:23:05,980
at least he left something behind.

505
00:23:07,340 --> 00:23:09,340
And thank goodness for
his new daughter-in-law.

506
00:23:09,940 --> 00:23:10,980
She's handling everything,

507
00:23:11,460 --> 00:23:13,140
inside and out, all by herself.

508
00:23:13,740 --> 00:23:15,580
The funeral was quite dignified.

509
00:23:15,900 --> 00:23:16,500
Yes.

510
00:23:17,740 --> 00:23:18,860
It hasn't been easy for her.

511
00:23:29,420 --> 00:23:30,380
Elders,

512
00:23:30,960 --> 00:23:32,950
you've been here all night,
you must be exhausted.

513
00:23:32,980 --> 00:23:34,760
We've bought some
steamed buns and soy milk.

514
00:23:34,860 --> 00:23:36,380
Please eat something first.

515
00:23:37,140 --> 00:23:37,500
Here.

516
00:23:39,740 --> 00:23:41,060
Here, eat something.

517
00:23:49,100 --> 00:23:50,340
Please eat something.

518
00:23:59,820 --> 00:24:00,500
Aunt.

519
00:24:01,100 --> 00:24:02,060
How's my mom?

520
00:24:06,940 --> 00:24:08,660
It's one tragedy after another.

521
00:24:08,660 --> 00:24:09,950
It's too much for her to take it.

522
00:24:11,660 --> 00:24:12,340
Aunt,

523
00:24:13,060 --> 00:24:14,300
eat something.

524
00:24:15,260 --> 00:24:16,540
I have no appetite.

525
00:24:18,700 --> 00:24:20,980
Why is fate being so hard
on your and my sister?

526
00:24:24,660 --> 00:24:25,500
Mingzhu,

527
00:24:27,180 --> 00:24:28,380
my sister has collapsed.

528
00:24:28,940 --> 00:24:30,620
Meiqi is young

529
00:24:30,620 --> 00:24:31,700
and unreliable.

530
00:24:32,740 --> 00:24:34,580
This family is counting on you now.

531
00:24:36,500 --> 00:24:38,580
You have to hold on, alright?

532
00:24:40,020 --> 00:24:41,540
And you're pregnant.

533
00:24:42,220 --> 00:24:43,780
You must take care of yourself.

534
00:24:45,580 --> 00:24:46,500
Don't worry, Aunt.

535
00:24:46,500 --> 00:24:47,260
I'm alright.

536
00:24:48,220 --> 00:24:50,340
Your father-in-law was a good man.

537
00:24:51,720 --> 00:24:52,900
And just like that, he's gone.

538
00:24:55,820 --> 00:24:56,500
Mingzhu,

539
00:24:57,620 --> 00:24:58,700
we need to give him

540
00:24:59,980 --> 00:25:01,780
a proper funeral.

541
00:25:02,220 --> 00:25:03,860
He was a respectable man.

542
00:25:04,380 --> 00:25:06,540
We should send him
off with dignity too,

543
00:25:06,540 --> 00:25:07,420
okay?

544
00:25:08,500 --> 00:25:09,620
Don't worry, Aunt.

545
00:25:10,160 --> 00:25:11,500
I'll make sure it's done properly.

546
00:25:13,060 --> 00:25:15,140
Thank you, Mingzhu.

547
00:25:16,080 --> 00:25:17,780
A lavish funeral?
What does "lavish" mean?

548
00:25:18,180 --> 00:25:19,260
It means spend like crazy.

549
00:25:21,100 --> 00:25:21,860
Spend like crazy?

550
00:25:26,140 --> 00:25:27,650
The Feng family's main pillar is gone.

551
00:25:28,080 --> 00:25:29,550
What's the point of a lavish funeral?

552
00:25:30,580 --> 00:25:31,980
The living still need to survive.

553
00:25:32,820 --> 00:25:33,780
That's right.

554
00:25:34,020 --> 00:25:35,100
And Mingzhu has a baby

555
00:25:35,100 --> 00:25:36,380
on the way to think about.

556
00:25:38,100 --> 00:25:38,860
This won't do.

557
00:25:38,900 --> 00:25:40,660
I'll go talk to Jianqi's mother.

558
00:25:40,840 --> 00:25:41,500
I'll talk to her.

559
00:25:41,500 --> 00:25:42,940
She's probably not thinking clearly,

560
00:25:43,060 --> 00:25:44,300
listening to all those relatives

561
00:25:44,300 --> 00:25:45,140
spouting nonsense.

562
00:25:45,200 --> 00:25:46,780
- I'm going to.
- Where are you going?

563
00:25:46,960 --> 00:25:48,500
You always have to stick your nose in.

564
00:25:48,740 --> 00:25:49,740
If you go now

565
00:25:49,940 --> 00:25:51,340
and tell them to be frugal,

566
00:25:52,420 --> 00:25:53,740
you're just asking for an earful.

567
00:25:53,980 --> 00:25:54,540
I mean,

568
00:25:54,540 --> 00:25:56,700
they have to consider their future.

569
00:25:56,700 --> 00:25:58,940
Mingzhu is pregnant now.

570
00:25:59,220 --> 00:26:00,900
She's not thinking straight.

571
00:26:00,900 --> 00:26:02,820
You can't just think
about yourself right now.

572
00:26:02,820 --> 00:26:03,340
You...

573
00:26:03,740 --> 00:26:06,060
They're overwhelmed
with funeral arrangements.

574
00:26:06,060 --> 00:26:07,180
What are you planning to do?

575
00:26:07,540 --> 00:26:08,900
Go start a fight?

576
00:26:09,300 --> 00:26:10,780
Think of a way to actually help.

577
00:26:10,780 --> 00:26:11,060
You...

578
00:26:13,420 --> 00:26:14,180
Mom, Dad,

579
00:26:15,180 --> 00:26:16,060
how about

580
00:26:17,020 --> 00:26:18,540
we consult Ni Debao?

581
00:26:20,100 --> 00:26:22,940
((Ni's Clinic,
Full-Service Funeral Arrangements)

582
00:26:22,940 --> 00:26:23,620
Funerals,

583
00:26:24,340 --> 00:26:26,620
let's be honest, are
really for the living.

584
00:26:26,900 --> 00:26:28,100
It's life's final stop.

585
00:26:28,110 --> 00:26:30,300
Once you close your eyes
and breathe your last breath, it's over.

586
00:26:30,300 --> 00:26:31,180
My take?

587
00:26:31,180 --> 00:26:32,940
However the family feels most
at peace, that's how you do it.

588
00:26:33,540 --> 00:26:34,100
Good point.

589
00:26:34,660 --> 00:26:35,900
- Exactly.
- So right.

590
00:26:36,540 --> 00:26:37,700
No wonder they say Debao

591
00:26:37,700 --> 00:26:40,820
is the top dog in the funeral business.

592
00:26:40,820 --> 00:26:42,500
Oh, quit it, quit it.

593
00:26:42,620 --> 00:26:43,980
I know what you're really saying.

594
00:26:45,300 --> 00:26:46,980
Don't spend too much money,

595
00:26:47,410 --> 00:26:48,940
but don't skimp on the ceremony either.

596
00:26:48,960 --> 00:26:50,540
We can't give the Feng family relatives

597
00:26:50,540 --> 00:26:51,780
any reason to nitpick.

598
00:26:52,180 --> 00:26:53,540
Do I have that right?

599
00:27:03,380 --> 00:27:03,980
Mom,

600
00:27:04,300 --> 00:27:05,740
stop worrying.

601
00:27:06,300 --> 00:27:08,140
Once Mingzhu's
father-in-law is laid to rest,

602
00:27:08,140 --> 00:27:09,660
I'll take you to see her.

603
00:27:10,700 --> 00:27:12,980
You'll take me?

604
00:27:12,980 --> 00:27:14,320
Who dares go over there right now?

605
00:27:15,300 --> 00:27:18,860
That Yue Xiu'e, one minute she's nice,
the next she's a nightmare.

606
00:27:19,300 --> 00:27:21,020
Honestly, I'm scared of her myself.

607
00:27:21,020 --> 00:27:22,780
If we push her too far,

608
00:27:22,780 --> 00:27:23,780
she might not

609
00:27:23,780 --> 00:27:25,460
let us see Mingzhu anymore.

610
00:27:25,460 --> 00:27:26,500
What would we do then?

611
00:27:28,060 --> 00:27:28,940
You startled me.

612
00:27:28,940 --> 00:27:30,060
What are you talking about?

613
00:27:30,500 --> 00:27:31,540
Let her try!

614
00:27:31,820 --> 00:27:32,540
She wouldn't dare!

615
00:27:32,940 --> 00:27:33,540
Dad,

616
00:27:33,660 --> 00:27:36,560
if Chen was here, you yelling like that
might scare her into early labor.

617
00:27:37,340 --> 00:27:38,300
Listen to your father,

618
00:27:40,500 --> 00:27:42,180
all bark, no bite.

619
00:27:42,460 --> 00:27:43,560
Strong only at home, got it?

620
00:27:43,580 --> 00:27:45,410
Fine then, Xu Dacheng,
if you've got the guts,

621
00:27:45,460 --> 00:27:46,740
go get Mingzhu back for me.

622
00:27:46,740 --> 00:27:47,700
Go on.

623
00:27:48,300 --> 00:27:49,140
Yu Jingxiang,

624
00:27:49,300 --> 00:27:52,460
things were going just fine.

625
00:27:52,980 --> 00:27:54,660
It's because you lost your cool.

626
00:27:54,660 --> 00:27:55,780
So now it's all my fault?

627
00:27:55,780 --> 00:27:57,180
- Whose fault should it be?
- Yours.

628
00:27:57,180 --> 00:27:57,900
How is it my fault?

629
00:27:57,900 --> 00:27:58,500
Of course it's your fault.

630
00:27:58,500 --> 00:27:59,660
If you hadn't gone to jail back then...

631
00:27:59,660 --> 00:28:01,580
Arguing, arguing, always arguing!

632
00:28:01,580 --> 00:28:02,140
She's...

633
00:28:03,700 --> 00:28:05,140
If arguing solved anything,

634
00:28:05,140 --> 00:28:07,300
you could go fight at the
funeral home right now.

635
00:28:07,500 --> 00:28:08,100
Go yell

636
00:28:08,220 --> 00:28:10,340
until Mingzhu's father-in-law
comes back alive.

637
00:28:10,820 --> 00:28:12,580
He was the backbone
of their whole family.

638
00:28:12,580 --> 00:28:13,260
Well, we...

639
00:28:13,260 --> 00:28:14,820
We're not that capable.

640
00:28:18,220 --> 00:28:19,620
Let's go back to eating.

641
00:28:23,220 --> 00:28:25,780
Why is life so hard on Mingzhu?

642
00:28:26,700 --> 00:28:28,300
She was taken away when she was tiny

643
00:28:28,300 --> 00:28:29,620
and grew up without her real mom,

644
00:28:29,860 --> 00:28:30,260
right?

645
00:28:30,860 --> 00:28:32,180
Finally, she grows up

646
00:28:33,140 --> 00:28:34,340
and marries into a good family.

647
00:28:36,220 --> 00:28:37,240
But then, the Feng family

648
00:28:37,340 --> 00:28:38,900
lost a son, then lost the father.

649
00:28:38,900 --> 00:28:39,580
It's just...

650
00:28:42,260 --> 00:28:44,500
Do you think there's a problem
with their feng shui?

651
00:28:45,260 --> 00:28:47,420
Should they move?

652
00:28:47,420 --> 00:28:48,220
Could be.

653
00:28:48,300 --> 00:28:50,580
I heard when a house is too big,
it can't hold its energy.

654
00:28:50,580 --> 00:28:51,580
That's right.

655
00:28:51,580 --> 00:28:52,620
Our house is good.

656
00:28:52,660 --> 00:28:54,540
It's not too big,
so it holds the energy well.

657
00:28:54,540 --> 00:28:55,020
Yes.

658
00:28:55,020 --> 00:28:56,220
We've lived here for decades.

659
00:28:56,760 --> 00:28:57,460
Dad went to jail.

660
00:28:58,060 --> 00:28:59,210
Little sister got given away.

661
00:28:59,220 --> 00:29:00,210
Little brother's useless.

662
00:29:00,580 --> 00:29:01,260
And me?

663
00:29:01,480 --> 00:29:02,540
Nothing impressive at all.

664
00:29:02,620 --> 00:29:04,380
You tell me,
is our feng shui good or not?

665
00:29:04,620 --> 00:29:05,220
Is it good?

666
00:29:06,900 --> 00:29:08,140
Look at it this way instead.

667
00:29:08,340 --> 00:29:09,620
Dad changed his ways,

668
00:29:10,140 --> 00:29:13,460
little sister came home, the useless
brother got married and is having a kid,

669
00:29:13,460 --> 00:29:15,500
and I'm about to
have my second child.

670
00:29:15,560 --> 00:29:17,290
Now tell me, is that
good feng shui or not?

671
00:29:17,300 --> 00:29:18,500
- Of course it's good.
- Is it good?

672
00:29:18,500 --> 00:29:19,700
Of course it is.

673
00:29:19,700 --> 00:29:21,060
Life has its ups and downs,

674
00:29:21,060 --> 00:29:22,380
that's perfectly normal.

675
00:29:22,380 --> 00:29:24,220
Don't blame everything on feng shui,

676
00:29:24,220 --> 00:29:25,180
that's so superstitious.

677
00:29:25,420 --> 00:29:27,300
I think Mingzhu's place is great.

678
00:29:27,300 --> 00:29:28,020
Really great.

679
00:29:28,100 --> 00:29:29,020
I love it.

680
00:29:29,080 --> 00:29:31,290
Other than being expensive,
there's nothing wrong with it.

681
00:29:31,300 --> 00:29:34,620
(In loving remembrance)

682
00:29:34,620 --> 00:29:38,820
The mighty river flows ever eastward,

683
00:29:39,060 --> 00:29:42,460
A soul departs on a journey
with no return.

684
00:29:44,140 --> 00:29:45,580
Bow.

685
00:29:51,300 --> 00:29:52,620
Bow again.

686
00:29:59,220 --> 00:30:00,620
Final bow.

687
00:30:03,620 --> 00:30:04,820
(Forever in our memory
- In loving remembrance)

688
00:30:04,820 --> 00:30:06,140
Please accept our condolences.

689
00:30:06,420 --> 00:30:09,020
We will now proceed to the funeral home.

690
00:30:09,780 --> 00:30:10,480
This is the place.

691
00:30:10,660 --> 00:30:11,340
This is it.

692
00:30:11,340 --> 00:30:12,020
Everyone's here.

693
00:30:12,500 --> 00:30:13,180
Is everyone here?

694
00:30:13,180 --> 00:30:15,020
Who's in charge of this family now?

695
00:30:15,030 --> 00:30:16,570
The person who calls
the shots, step forward!

696
00:30:16,580 --> 00:30:17,620
Come talk to us.

697
00:30:17,620 --> 00:30:18,420
What is this about?

698
00:30:18,420 --> 00:30:19,060
Is it you?

699
00:30:19,960 --> 00:30:20,920
We're here for the debt.

700
00:30:21,020 --> 00:30:23,060
Feng Zhi owed all of us money.

701
00:30:23,820 --> 00:30:25,260
If we don't get paid today,

702
00:30:25,270 --> 00:30:26,340
nobody's burying anybody.

703
00:30:26,860 --> 00:30:27,820
No one leaves.

704
00:30:29,020 --> 00:30:30,740
You mustn't block
the path of the departed.

705
00:30:30,740 --> 00:30:33,340
Blocking it will bring trouble
upon your family.

706
00:30:33,340 --> 00:30:34,060
And who are you

707
00:30:34,060 --> 00:30:35,020
to lecture us?

708
00:30:35,020 --> 00:30:36,260
Cut the superstitious nonsense.

709
00:30:36,460 --> 00:30:37,420
That's superstitious.

710
00:30:37,540 --> 00:30:38,580
Let them finish.

711
00:30:40,060 --> 00:30:42,620
Feng's factory has been insolvent

712
00:30:43,180 --> 00:30:44,220
since the year before last.

713
00:30:45,300 --> 00:30:46,780
He's been robbing Peter to pay Paul.

714
00:30:47,500 --> 00:30:49,380
We suppliers didn't

715
00:30:50,340 --> 00:30:51,420
have the heart to press him.

716
00:30:52,020 --> 00:30:53,410
We thought he'd turn things around.

717
00:30:54,100 --> 00:30:56,340
But before anything turned around,
he was gone.

718
00:30:57,340 --> 00:30:58,020
Heart attack.

719
00:30:58,020 --> 00:30:58,700
No one,

720
00:30:59,020 --> 00:31:00,420
no one saw this coming.

721
00:31:00,420 --> 00:31:01,140
- Do you understand now?
- Listen to me,

722
00:31:01,140 --> 00:31:02,260
he owes me hundreds of thousands.

723
00:31:02,260 --> 00:31:03,180
I want that money today.

724
00:31:03,180 --> 00:31:04,220
Hundreds of thousands?

725
00:31:04,620 --> 00:31:06,220
He took 12 machines from me.

726
00:31:06,220 --> 00:31:08,020
That's a few million right there.

727
00:31:08,020 --> 00:31:09,620
And I haven't seen a single cent back.

728
00:31:09,620 --> 00:31:10,180
You hear me?

729
00:31:10,180 --> 00:31:11,300
I'm getting an explanation today.

730
00:31:11,300 --> 00:31:12,180
- Do you hear me?
- When are you paying us?

731
00:31:12,180 --> 00:31:12,820
When we compared notes,

732
00:31:12,820 --> 00:31:14,580
we realized the truth,

733
00:31:14,900 --> 00:31:17,420
Feng's factory was an empty shell.

734
00:31:17,420 --> 00:31:18,780
Yes, an empty shell.

735
00:31:19,020 --> 00:31:19,860
That's impossible!

736
00:31:20,180 --> 00:31:21,180
How is it impossible?

737
00:31:21,180 --> 00:31:22,980
My dad never said
the company had any problems!

738
00:31:22,980 --> 00:31:24,060
You think he'd tell you?

739
00:31:24,060 --> 00:31:25,340
Don't be naive, girl.

740
00:31:25,460 --> 00:31:27,220
You must be the princess
who blows money.

741
00:31:27,220 --> 00:31:28,660
- You can't say that.
- Am I right?

742
00:31:28,960 --> 00:31:30,950
- Why would your dad tell you?
- Why can't I say that?

743
00:31:30,980 --> 00:31:32,860
Would telling you have gotten him

744
00:31:32,860 --> 00:31:33,900
money or manpower?

745
00:31:33,900 --> 00:31:35,700
You can't talk to her like that.

746
00:31:35,820 --> 00:31:36,700
Are you a Feng?

747
00:31:37,260 --> 00:31:38,180
If not, shut up!

748
00:31:38,180 --> 00:31:39,580
I'm a Feng, let me say something.

749
00:31:39,580 --> 00:31:40,220
Are you paying?

750
00:31:40,220 --> 00:31:40,740
You...

751
00:31:40,940 --> 00:31:41,980
If not, shut up too!

752
00:31:43,220 --> 00:31:45,300
So you're causing a scene
at my dad's funeral?

753
00:31:45,310 --> 00:31:46,820
Even if I had the money,
I wouldn't give it to you now!

754
00:31:48,360 --> 00:31:49,480
What can you do about it?

755
00:31:50,660 --> 00:31:51,860
Let's talk this through!

756
00:31:51,860 --> 00:31:53,660
No one's going anywhere
till we get paid!

757
00:31:57,060 --> 00:31:59,580
Please listen to me!

758
00:32:00,780 --> 00:32:01,860
Please calm down, guys.

759
00:32:02,220 --> 00:32:03,100
Calm down.

760
00:32:03,780 --> 00:32:05,900
This is the Feng family's funeral.

761
00:32:06,180 --> 00:32:07,140
Does making a scene

762
00:32:07,380 --> 00:32:08,620
solve anything?

763
00:32:10,500 --> 00:32:11,060
Look,

764
00:32:11,060 --> 00:32:12,940
Feng didn't just owe all of you money.

765
00:32:13,260 --> 00:32:14,580
He owed me money too,

766
00:32:14,580 --> 00:32:15,780
and not any less than yours.

767
00:32:15,780 --> 00:32:16,380
Wang,

768
00:32:16,620 --> 00:32:18,100
why are you still defending them then?

769
00:32:18,100 --> 00:32:19,620
What's wrong with you?

770
00:32:19,620 --> 00:32:20,980
The Feng family representative

771
00:32:21,220 --> 00:32:22,380
is standing right here.

772
00:32:22,580 --> 00:32:24,180
Can we at least hear her out first?

773
00:32:24,180 --> 00:32:25,580
Hear what she has to say?

774
00:32:25,580 --> 00:32:26,420
Alright, alright, go ahead.

775
00:32:26,420 --> 00:32:27,660
- Go ahead.
- Let's hear it.

776
00:32:27,900 --> 00:32:29,860
We were all his friends, weren't we?

777
00:32:32,580 --> 00:32:33,540
If we owe you money,

778
00:32:34,380 --> 00:32:35,340
we won't deny it.

779
00:32:36,340 --> 00:32:38,300
But now is not
the time to settle accounts.

780
00:32:40,060 --> 00:32:41,740
Let us lay my father-in-law
to rest first.

781
00:32:41,960 --> 00:32:43,420
After that, we will
go through everything

782
00:32:43,420 --> 00:32:44,660
and settle it with each of you.

783
00:32:45,620 --> 00:32:47,460
You all know

784
00:32:47,780 --> 00:32:49,500
what kind of man he was.

785
00:32:50,020 --> 00:32:50,980
If you didn't trust him,

786
00:32:50,980 --> 00:32:53,060
you wouldn't have lent him
your hard-earned money.

787
00:32:53,540 --> 00:32:54,700
He's gone now.

788
00:32:55,240 --> 00:32:56,460
The dead deserve their dignity.

789
00:32:56,980 --> 00:32:58,100
So I'm asking all of you,

790
00:32:58,700 --> 00:32:59,820
please let our family

791
00:32:59,820 --> 00:33:01,060
finish this funeral properly

792
00:33:01,060 --> 00:33:03,100
and let us say goodbye to him, okay?

793
00:33:05,500 --> 00:33:06,380
I give you my word,

794
00:33:07,620 --> 00:33:08,460
we will

795
00:33:09,820 --> 00:33:11,180
pay you back every cent,

796
00:33:11,180 --> 00:33:12,720
even if we have to
sell everything we own.

797
00:33:23,340 --> 00:33:26,500
The sun rises in the east
and sets in the west,

798
00:33:27,300 --> 00:33:30,540
The departed has left,
never to return.

799
00:33:31,660 --> 00:33:33,020
Feng Zhi,

800
00:33:34,060 --> 00:33:37,980
we are here to see you
on your final journey.

801
00:33:39,780 --> 00:33:44,540
May you rest in peace.

802
00:33:51,380 --> 00:33:53,060
(Blessings)

803
00:33:53,540 --> 00:33:55,100
(Grave of Feng Zhi)
Returning to one's roots in death,

804
00:33:55,580 --> 00:33:57,820
the spirit returns to its homeland.

805
00:33:58,340 --> 00:33:59,900
Mr. Feng Zhi,

806
00:34:00,380 --> 00:34:01,780
may you rest in peace.

807
00:34:04,620 --> 00:34:05,980
Girl, girl.

808
00:34:06,560 --> 00:34:07,700
Offer a toast to your father.

809
00:34:19,580 --> 00:34:20,180
Dad,

810
00:34:22,900 --> 00:34:24,820
I won't get to toast you anymore.

811
00:34:30,380 --> 00:34:31,260
Please have a drink.

812
00:34:31,380 --> 00:34:33,620
(In loving remembrance)

813
00:34:56,340 --> 00:34:57,700
This is our family photo.

814
00:34:59,100 --> 00:35:00,380
Please don't forget us.

815
00:35:03,980 --> 00:35:05,780
And your favorite fountain pen.

816
00:35:07,020 --> 00:35:08,180
Blue-black ink.

817
00:35:09,060 --> 00:35:10,260
I filled it for you.

818
00:35:12,660 --> 00:35:14,340
And your phone.

819
00:35:15,980 --> 00:35:16,660
Meiqi,

820
00:35:17,900 --> 00:35:19,140
we need to keep the phone.

821
00:35:20,020 --> 00:35:21,950
We'll need it to settle accounts
with the creditors.

822
00:35:30,620 --> 00:35:34,900
Drums echo through the valley,
all rites return to one.

823
00:35:35,140 --> 00:35:38,340
Family members, please bow
before the tombstone.

824
00:35:39,300 --> 00:35:40,220
Please bow.

825
00:35:48,900 --> 00:35:50,420
Bow again.

826
00:35:56,060 --> 00:35:57,380
Final bow.

827
00:36:04,140 --> 00:36:05,220
The ceremony is complete.

828
00:36:07,340 --> 00:36:09,860
Family and friends may now
come forward to offer incense.

829
00:36:16,540 --> 00:36:17,020
Hello.

830
00:36:17,020 --> 00:36:18,860
Hello, are you Feng Zhi's family?

831
00:36:19,020 --> 00:36:20,380
I am.

832
00:36:20,860 --> 00:36:22,100
Who is this?

833
00:36:23,020 --> 00:36:23,780
Here's the thing.

834
00:36:24,620 --> 00:36:27,100
The mortgage for Unit 8001, Block 6,

835
00:36:27,100 --> 00:36:29,340
Xin City Grand Court is overdue.

836
00:36:29,820 --> 00:36:31,780
We paid for that apartment in full.

837
00:36:31,780 --> 00:36:32,700
There is no mortgage.

838
00:36:33,980 --> 00:36:35,580
It's a collateral loan.

839
00:36:36,140 --> 00:36:38,620
This property was mortgaged
for two million last year.

840
00:36:40,020 --> 00:36:42,140
Can you put me in touch with Mr. Feng?

841
00:36:43,380 --> 00:36:43,860
Hi.

842
00:36:45,280 --> 00:36:46,380
Are you the family member?

843
00:36:48,380 --> 00:36:49,500
This is the itemized bill.

844
00:36:49,620 --> 00:36:50,620
I'll need your signature.

845
00:36:50,860 --> 00:36:51,420
Okay.

846
00:36:56,060 --> 00:36:57,100
This isn't right.

847
00:36:58,380 --> 00:36:59,900
When we bought the plot,

848
00:37:00,260 --> 00:37:02,140
the headstone was included in the price.

849
00:37:02,580 --> 00:37:04,380
Why are there all these extra charges?

850
00:37:04,660 --> 00:37:06,060
The engraving, the porcelain photo,

851
00:37:06,060 --> 00:37:07,380
the gold-leaf detailing

852
00:37:07,380 --> 00:37:08,380
are separate fees.

853
00:37:08,380 --> 00:37:09,060
Don't worry,

854
00:37:09,060 --> 00:37:10,780
everything is clearly priced.

855
00:37:10,780 --> 00:37:11,380
Hang on,

856
00:37:11,380 --> 00:37:13,380
everything was supposed to be included.

857
00:37:13,660 --> 00:37:14,900
And today's burial ceremony,

858
00:37:14,900 --> 00:37:16,220
we handled that ourselves.

859
00:37:16,740 --> 00:37:17,540
So where did

860
00:37:17,820 --> 00:37:19,900
(Burial service)
this 1,888 yuan service fee come from?

861
00:37:20,740 --> 00:37:21,300
Yes.

862
00:37:21,300 --> 00:37:22,700
It's true you did

863
00:37:22,700 --> 00:37:23,740
the ceremony yourselves,

864
00:37:23,740 --> 00:37:25,180
but we provided

865
00:37:25,190 --> 00:37:27,900
the electric cart, set up the tent, and
handled the guiding services.

866
00:37:27,900 --> 00:37:29,260
Those things come with charges.

867
00:37:29,410 --> 00:37:30,740
The headstone itself is included,

868
00:37:30,740 --> 00:37:32,940
but engraving costs extra.

869
00:37:33,860 --> 00:37:36,500
Then why didn't you make
all this clear from the start?

870
00:37:38,900 --> 00:37:40,180
I can't accept these charges.

871
00:37:40,260 --> 00:37:40,900
Look,

872
00:37:41,020 --> 00:37:42,660
our prices are all posted.

873
00:37:43,100 --> 00:37:46,020
And besides, letting the deceased rest in
peace is what matters most,

874
00:37:46,380 --> 00:37:46,900
right?

875
00:37:46,900 --> 00:37:48,220
The deceased is laid to rest,

876
00:37:48,460 --> 00:37:49,860
and that's why you wait until now

877
00:37:49,860 --> 00:37:50,940
to show me a surprise bill?

878
00:37:51,180 --> 00:37:52,900
Does that seem reasonable to you?

879
00:37:52,960 --> 00:37:54,860
Can the deceased truly
rest in peace that way?

880
00:37:55,620 --> 00:37:57,220
That's not a fair thing to say.

881
00:37:58,060 --> 00:37:59,360
The deceased should come first.

882
00:37:59,620 --> 00:38:00,380
Don't you think?

883
00:38:00,390 --> 00:38:01,840
Yes, the deceased should come first.

884
00:38:02,340 --> 00:38:04,060
But don't try to guilt-trip us.

885
00:38:04,060 --> 00:38:06,120
Does being the grieving family mean
we should just throw money at you?

886
00:38:06,130 --> 00:38:07,380
Where's the price list?

887
00:38:07,390 --> 00:38:09,380
Is it even posted in your lobby?
Show it to me.

888
00:38:09,620 --> 00:38:10,900
Enough. It's not that much money.

889
00:38:10,900 --> 00:38:11,660
I'll pay.

890
00:38:11,760 --> 00:38:12,380
Hang on, Meiqi,

891
00:38:12,380 --> 00:38:13,500
this isn't about the amount.

892
00:38:13,500 --> 00:38:15,180
Isn't this arguing just about the money?

893
00:38:15,960 --> 00:38:17,440
Is this really the occasion for that?

894
00:38:17,900 --> 00:38:19,380
Can't you consider the bigger picture?

895
00:38:22,220 --> 00:38:23,100
There is no

896
00:38:23,340 --> 00:38:24,900
bigger picture for this family anymore.

897
00:38:29,860 --> 00:38:31,620
Do you have a receipt
and an itemized bill?

898
00:38:31,620 --> 00:38:32,220
Yes.

899
00:38:32,700 --> 00:38:33,860
If you're overcharging,

900
00:38:34,340 --> 00:38:35,380
I will be back.

901
00:38:35,900 --> 00:38:36,500
Alright.

902
00:38:37,060 --> 00:38:37,740
Then...

903
00:38:40,620 --> 00:38:42,020
(Party A, Shen Mingzhu)

904
00:38:45,860 --> 00:38:46,380
Alright.

905
00:38:46,900 --> 00:38:47,700
Thank you.

906
00:39:06,860 --> 00:39:07,620
Yes, Mr. Zhao.

907
00:39:08,780 --> 00:39:11,120
I've always been the one in
charge of campus recruitment.

908
00:39:12,220 --> 00:39:12,980
Yes.

909
00:39:13,420 --> 00:39:15,460
I'm fairly experienced in that area.

910
00:39:18,940 --> 00:39:20,340
Thank you.

911
00:39:21,500 --> 00:39:22,780
Oh, you flatter me.

912
00:39:25,460 --> 00:39:26,820
Okay, okay.

913
00:39:27,420 --> 00:39:28,940
Thanks, boss.

914
00:39:28,940 --> 00:39:29,620
Okay, bye.

915
00:39:36,020 --> 00:39:36,900
Director Zhao

916
00:39:37,900 --> 00:39:40,540
just called to encourage me.

917
00:39:42,500 --> 00:39:44,340
I feel like I've really
got a shot this time.

918
00:39:44,660 --> 00:39:46,340
You know, Mingzhu's father-in-law

919
00:39:46,340 --> 00:39:48,620
really did have some good connections.

920
00:39:50,460 --> 00:39:51,620
We should treat him to a meal.

921
00:39:54,560 --> 00:39:55,720
You treat him if you want to.

922
00:39:56,460 --> 00:39:57,020
I'm not.

923
00:39:57,740 --> 00:39:58,940
Why are you so stingy?

924
00:40:00,220 --> 00:40:01,540
This is important business.

925
00:40:01,540 --> 00:40:02,580
We owe it to him.

926
00:40:02,580 --> 00:40:03,740
He's gone.

927
00:40:03,900 --> 00:40:04,820
Gone where?

928
00:40:05,340 --> 00:40:06,820
Went on a trip? Well, he'll come back.

929
00:40:07,740 --> 00:40:08,820
He's not coming back.

930
00:40:10,060 --> 00:40:10,880
What, he went abroad?

931
00:40:13,460 --> 00:40:14,620
He passed away.

932
00:40:17,780 --> 00:40:18,580
A heart attack.

933
00:40:21,060 --> 00:40:22,020
(In loving memory)

934
00:40:22,020 --> 00:40:22,700
Meiqi,

935
00:40:23,340 --> 00:40:25,700
you haven't eaten properly for days.

936
00:40:27,580 --> 00:40:29,100
Have some soup, okay?

937
00:40:29,740 --> 00:40:31,180
Your body won't hold up otherwise.

938
00:40:35,860 --> 00:40:36,540
Meiqi,

939
00:40:37,220 --> 00:40:38,540
many elders have come.

940
00:40:38,860 --> 00:40:40,020
Let's go offer them a toast

941
00:40:40,020 --> 00:40:41,180
to show our appreciation.

942
00:40:42,660 --> 00:40:43,060
No.

943
00:40:44,500 --> 00:40:46,180
I can't handle this kind of occasion.

944
00:40:55,220 --> 00:40:56,100
Elders,

945
00:40:56,860 --> 00:40:58,460
on behalf of my family,

946
00:40:58,620 --> 00:40:59,940
I thank you all for coming

947
00:40:59,940 --> 00:41:01,740
to see my father-in-law off.

948
00:41:02,700 --> 00:41:04,540
Let me propose a toast with tea.

949
00:41:04,820 --> 00:41:05,340
Of course.

950
00:41:05,340 --> 00:41:06,140
Thank you.

951
00:41:06,460 --> 00:41:07,100
Mingzhu,

952
00:41:07,260 --> 00:41:08,260
the departed are gone.

953
00:41:08,260 --> 00:41:09,440
The living must look forward.

954
00:41:10,180 --> 00:41:11,980
You must stay strong.

955
00:41:12,260 --> 00:41:13,340
I got it. Thank you.

956
00:41:14,860 --> 00:41:15,660
Meiqi,

957
00:41:16,740 --> 00:41:18,460
your sister-in-law is pregnant.

958
00:41:18,660 --> 00:41:20,620
It's not easy for her,
carrying a baby like that.

959
00:41:21,140 --> 00:41:23,140
Your family will depend
on you from now on.

960
00:41:24,100 --> 00:41:26,540
You need to step up when the time comes,

961
00:41:26,540 --> 00:41:27,340
you know?

962
00:41:40,100 --> 00:41:40,700
Hello.

963
00:41:40,980 --> 00:41:41,780
(Hello.)

964
00:41:42,100 --> 00:41:43,380
(Congratulations, Miss Feng.)

965
00:41:43,500 --> 00:41:44,900
(You've been hired.)

966
00:41:44,980 --> 00:41:46,160
(May I know when you can come)

967
00:41:46,160 --> 00:41:47,740
(to complete the onboarding procedures?)

968
00:41:54,660 --> 00:41:55,260
(Hello?)

969
00:41:55,540 --> 00:41:56,260
(Miss Feng?)

970
00:41:57,660 --> 00:41:58,540
I'm sorry.

971
00:42:00,980 --> 00:42:02,950
I'm afraid I won't be able
to accept the position.

972
00:42:10,380 --> 00:42:11,780
I'm sorry to trouble you again.

973
00:42:12,660 --> 00:42:13,940
Well, Dad, I'll leave you be.

974
00:42:13,940 --> 00:42:14,980
I'm going back.

975
00:42:15,980 --> 00:42:16,900
Please wait.

976
00:42:18,580 --> 00:42:19,700
Inside this safe are

977
00:42:20,260 --> 00:42:22,060
the company's corporate seal,

978
00:42:22,260 --> 00:42:23,260
the financial seal,

979
00:42:23,500 --> 00:42:25,300
and all the accounts and records.

980
00:42:26,060 --> 00:42:27,940
The password is Jianqi's birthday.

981
00:42:29,340 --> 00:42:30,620
If one day...

982
00:42:31,380 --> 00:42:32,780
I mean just in case...

983
00:42:33,420 --> 00:42:34,860
Just in case something happens to me,

984
00:42:35,580 --> 00:42:38,140
you won't be left scrambling.

985
00:42:38,380 --> 00:42:39,300
I'll leave its key

986
00:42:40,220 --> 00:42:41,180
right here.
