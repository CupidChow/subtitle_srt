00:01:10,752 --> 00:01:12,431
=Those Days=

00:01:12,431 --> 00:01:14,800
(Adapted from iceread.com novel
"You Xi" by Qingyang Wanxi)

3
00:01:14,980 --> 00:01:18,130
=Episode 31=

4
00:01:18,720 --> 00:01:20,119
You have a new food delivery order.

5
00:01:23,240 --> 00:01:24,039
Mr. Shen.

6
00:01:24,960 --> 00:01:26,839
Your skills haven't aged at all.

7
00:01:29,559 --> 00:01:30,240
Well?

8
00:01:30,759 --> 00:01:31,960
I made it for your nephew.

9
00:01:32,520 --> 00:01:33,960
I'll test it for him.

10
00:01:34,640 --> 00:01:36,240
Don't break it.

11
00:01:36,880 --> 00:01:37,600
It's fun.

12
00:01:39,919 --> 00:01:41,559
Eat. Why aren't you eating?

13
00:01:42,160 --> 00:01:43,399
I saved

14
00:01:43,399 --> 00:01:44,759
some of the food for Bichen.

15
00:01:44,960 --> 00:01:46,839
No need to save any more for her.

16
00:01:46,960 --> 00:01:48,319
Mom, no need to save any for her.

17
00:01:48,440 --> 00:01:50,319
She's eating at her parents' today.

18
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:52,440
She went to her mom's?

19
00:01:53,160 --> 00:01:54,440
Will she be back tonight?

20
00:01:54,440 --> 00:01:55,800
Yeah, I'll pick her up later.

21
00:02:00,880 --> 00:02:01,640
Dad, Mom.

22
00:02:02,919 --> 00:02:05,160
I want to discuss something.

23
00:02:06,039 --> 00:02:06,679
Go on.

24
00:02:07,559 --> 00:02:08,760
Chen's cultural center

25
00:02:08,760 --> 00:02:10,520
built a new center at Qianhu.

26
00:02:10,640 --> 00:02:11,559
They're short on staff.

27
00:02:12,119 --> 00:02:14,279
If she transfers, she gets promoted.

28
00:02:14,480 --> 00:02:15,839
They also give staff housing.

29
00:02:16,240 --> 00:02:17,599
Chen and I checked it out.

30
00:02:17,670 --> 00:02:18,960
An 80 square meter, two-bed unit.

31
00:02:18,960 --> 00:02:20,279
The environment is great.

32
00:02:20,279 --> 00:02:21,599
There's a lake and courts.

33
00:02:21,599 --> 00:02:23,240
Wait, Qianhu...

34
00:02:23,240 --> 00:02:24,879
Where on earth is that?

35
00:02:24,879 --> 00:02:25,999
Very far.

36
00:02:25,999 --> 00:02:27,559
A place no one goes to.

37
00:02:27,559 --> 00:02:28,879
Dad, you're exaggerating.

38
00:02:28,879 --> 00:02:30,119
There's a new highway.

39
00:02:30,279 --> 00:02:31,599
It's only 40 minutes.

40
00:02:31,999 --> 00:02:32,520
4...

41
00:02:32,520 --> 00:02:34,040
Is 40 minutes not far?

42
00:02:34,040 --> 00:02:35,879
Exactly, it's too far.

43
00:02:36,080 --> 00:02:36,640
You...

44
00:02:36,839 --> 00:02:37,640
Alright. Let me ask.

45
00:02:37,640 --> 00:02:39,640
Why are you telling us this?

46
00:02:40,240 --> 00:02:41,159
What do you mean?

47
00:02:42,119 --> 00:02:45,399
Chen said she wants to go.

48
00:02:46,320 --> 00:02:47,480
She wants to go. Chen...

49
00:02:47,920 --> 00:02:49,080
She's pregnant.

50
00:02:49,200 --> 00:02:50,879
It's not a problem.

51
00:02:50,960 --> 00:02:52,559
She's months from due date.

52
00:02:52,559 --> 00:02:53,719
Her boss said

53
00:02:53,719 --> 00:02:55,559
she'll get full maternity leave.

54
00:02:57,240 --> 00:02:58,240
Mainly, these years

55
00:02:58,240 --> 00:02:59,520
she's been filling forms.

56
00:02:59,520 --> 00:03:01,320
She finds it meaningless.

57
00:03:01,599 --> 00:03:03,240
This center is built from zero.

58
00:03:03,240 --> 00:03:04,119
To her,

59
00:03:04,480 --> 00:03:06,719
it's a great chance to shine.

60
00:03:08,960 --> 00:03:10,439
She'll go shine.

61
00:03:10,439 --> 00:03:11,399
What about you?

62
00:03:11,559 --> 00:03:12,240
Exactly.

63
00:03:13,920 --> 00:03:15,240
I'll quit my job

64
00:03:15,399 --> 00:03:16,439
and go with her.

65
00:03:17,200 --> 00:03:18,760
Quit?

66
00:03:19,879 --> 00:03:20,999
How will you provide?

67
00:03:20,999 --> 00:03:22,119
Mom, let me finish.

68
00:03:22,119 --> 00:03:23,960
You're a grown man.

69
00:03:23,960 --> 00:03:25,279
You should provide.

70
00:03:25,320 --> 00:03:27,320
If you quit this job,

71
00:03:28,839 --> 00:03:30,080
you'll have nothing.

72
00:03:30,080 --> 00:03:31,399
You can't support a family.

73
00:03:31,559 --> 00:03:32,879
But I'll have time.

74
00:03:32,960 --> 00:03:34,399
Chen and I agreed.

75
00:03:34,399 --> 00:03:35,800
After the baby comes,

76
00:03:35,800 --> 00:03:36,760
I'll raise them.

77
00:03:38,599 --> 00:03:41,640
You'll quit and raise the baby?

78
00:03:42,599 --> 00:03:44,240
You're a grown man.

79
00:03:44,240 --> 00:03:45,800
Mom, what's that thinking?

80
00:03:45,800 --> 00:03:47,760
There are tons of super dads.

81
00:03:48,240 --> 00:03:49,640
And online it says

82
00:03:49,640 --> 00:03:51,360
when elders raise kids,

83
00:03:51,439 --> 00:03:52,760
they tend to spoil them.

84
00:03:54,360 --> 00:03:55,350
What do you mean?

85
00:03:55,360 --> 00:03:56,119
Looking down on us?

86
00:03:56,119 --> 00:03:56,679
Yeah.

87
00:03:56,760 --> 00:03:57,839
Did we spoil

88
00:03:57,839 --> 00:03:59,040
you and your sister?

89
00:03:59,040 --> 00:03:59,640
Yes.

90
00:03:59,640 --> 00:04:00,559
I said it wrong.

91
00:04:00,559 --> 00:04:02,439
I didn't mean that at all.

92
00:04:02,879 --> 00:04:03,760
Silly kid.

93
00:04:03,760 --> 00:04:04,839
You're silly.

94
00:04:04,839 --> 00:04:06,360
No, I...

95
00:04:06,360 --> 00:04:08,320
Let me ask you.

96
00:04:08,480 --> 00:04:10,559
Bichen went home today.

97
00:04:11,879 --> 00:04:12,999
Did she tell her parents

98
00:04:12,999 --> 00:04:14,559
about this too?

99
00:04:15,879 --> 00:04:16,399
Yes.

100
00:04:16,399 --> 00:04:18,279
You two decided long ago.

101
00:04:18,560 --> 00:04:20,320
You're just letting us know.

102
00:04:20,320 --> 00:04:21,279
Informing us.

103
00:04:21,719 --> 00:04:23,359
Then you'll disappear.

104
00:04:23,719 --> 00:04:24,760
This isn't informing.

105
00:04:24,760 --> 00:04:26,200
We're really discussing.

106
00:04:26,200 --> 00:04:27,320
Discuss my foot.

107
00:04:27,599 --> 00:04:28,640
You call this discussing?

108
00:04:29,359 --> 00:04:30,960
If you're leaving, go now.

109
00:04:31,880 --> 00:04:33,760
Dacheng, calm down.

110
00:04:33,919 --> 00:04:35,479
Call Zhixia

111
00:04:35,479 --> 00:04:36,399
to deal with him.

112
00:04:36,399 --> 00:04:37,960
Don't call her.

113
00:04:38,960 --> 00:04:41,159
She's pregnant,
working, and raising Jiao.

114
00:04:41,919 --> 00:04:43,760
She's handled
every family issue for years.

115
00:04:44,270 --> 00:04:45,680
I don't want to add pressure to her.

116
00:04:46,479 --> 00:04:47,239
Besides,

117
00:04:47,520 --> 00:04:49,479
I'm becoming a dad.
I can't live at home forever.

118
00:04:49,479 --> 00:04:51,159
Clothes handed over and meals ready.

119
00:04:52,279 --> 00:04:53,000
Chen and I

120
00:04:53,680 --> 00:04:54,919
have already decided.

121
00:04:59,320 --> 00:04:59,960
Zhixia.

122
00:05:01,279 --> 00:05:03,039
Now I finally know how tired you are.

123
00:05:04,280 --> 00:05:05,359
The whole family's affairs

124
00:05:05,359 --> 00:05:07,000
are all on you alone.

125
00:05:08,039 --> 00:05:09,839
And no one steps up for you.

126
00:05:11,560 --> 00:05:12,599
Come home, okay?

127
00:05:13,599 --> 00:05:15,159
Tell me where, I'll pick you up.

128
00:05:16,320 --> 00:05:17,000
Okay?

129
00:05:31,279 --> 00:05:33,279
Maodou, are you free?

130
00:05:34,039 --> 00:05:35,200
I need you.

131
00:05:43,760 --> 00:05:44,880
Dad, you're back.

132
00:05:49,880 --> 00:05:50,479
Mom.

133
00:05:51,560 --> 00:05:52,359
Where's Zhixia?

134
00:05:55,120 --> 00:05:55,799
Working late.

135
00:05:56,880 --> 00:05:57,760
Let me tell you.

136
00:05:59,120 --> 00:06:00,839
I'm going to talk to her.

137
00:06:01,120 --> 00:06:02,960
Her attitude toward me was bad today.

138
00:06:03,080 --> 00:06:04,039
She hung up on me.

139
00:06:04,799 --> 00:06:06,520
Is that how you treat elders?

140
00:06:10,359 --> 00:06:11,950
Jiao. Do your homework in your room.

141
00:06:24,320 --> 00:06:25,279
Mom, I...

142
00:06:25,279 --> 00:06:27,080
I want to ask you something.

143
00:06:27,080 --> 00:06:29,200
Why did you call Zhixia

144
00:06:29,200 --> 00:06:31,039
and tell her to check the baby's gender?

145
00:06:31,039 --> 00:06:32,399
I told you already.

146
00:06:32,399 --> 00:06:33,760
The old house is being demolished.

147
00:06:33,760 --> 00:06:35,599
I need to plan our assets.

148
00:06:36,680 --> 00:06:38,680
She worked at a newspaper agency before,
right?

149
00:06:38,719 --> 00:06:40,159
No sense of the bigger picture?

150
00:06:40,880 --> 00:06:43,440
I'm happy whether it's a boy or girl.

151
00:06:43,440 --> 00:06:45,640
But the issue is when they grow up.

152
00:06:46,239 --> 00:06:47,880
A boy needs a wife.

153
00:06:47,880 --> 00:06:48,399
I know.

154
00:06:48,399 --> 00:06:50,479
A girl needs to get married.

155
00:06:50,479 --> 00:06:51,640
- It's not the same.
- I know.

156
00:06:51,640 --> 00:06:53,520
Why ignore even the basic traditions?

157
00:06:53,520 --> 00:06:54,760
I know.

158
00:06:54,839 --> 00:06:56,560
I know.

159
00:06:56,919 --> 00:06:59,239
Can you stop making more trouble?

160
00:06:59,239 --> 00:07:00,520
Please rest.

161
00:07:01,880 --> 00:07:03,200
You want me to rest?

162
00:07:03,599 --> 00:07:04,599
I want to rest.

163
00:07:04,599 --> 00:07:06,760
I was doing fine at the senior college.

164
00:07:07,320 --> 00:07:07,960
Who was it?

165
00:07:07,960 --> 00:07:09,000
Who called me

166
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:10,000
to get Jiao?

167
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:11,919
I had to drop everything

168
00:07:11,919 --> 00:07:12,880
and pick her up.

169
00:07:13,520 --> 00:07:14,640
Zhixia is her mother.

170
00:07:15,560 --> 00:07:17,039
Her job is flexible.

171
00:07:17,039 --> 00:07:17,839
She has time.

172
00:07:17,839 --> 00:07:19,880
She's a mother too.

173
00:07:19,880 --> 00:07:20,479
Right?

174
00:07:20,479 --> 00:07:21,960
She needs to balance

175
00:07:21,960 --> 00:07:23,520
family and work.

176
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:26,640
Mom.

177
00:07:27,560 --> 00:07:29,640
You've been through it too.

178
00:07:30,760 --> 00:07:33,200
When I was little,
you asked Grandma to watch me a lot.

179
00:07:33,200 --> 00:07:35,599
You argued with Dad
and scolded him for never helping.

180
00:07:35,719 --> 00:07:37,839
You were fine being a mom back then.

181
00:07:37,919 --> 00:07:39,000
Now that you're a grandma,

182
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:40,719
you're suddenly strict and picky.

183
00:07:41,020 --> 00:07:42,839
You want Zhixia
to balance career and family.

184
00:07:42,839 --> 00:07:43,719
Why?

185
00:07:44,320 --> 00:07:45,919
I'm just a clerk.

186
00:07:45,919 --> 00:07:48,000
When my boss sends me on a trip,
I have to go.

187
00:07:48,399 --> 00:07:49,560
Who supports this home?

188
00:07:49,960 --> 00:07:51,710
Why don't you hold me
to the same standard?

189
00:07:51,839 --> 00:07:53,200
You're a man.

190
00:07:53,200 --> 00:07:54,520
So what if I'm a man?

191
00:07:56,440 --> 00:07:57,520
In this family,

192
00:07:58,080 --> 00:07:59,640
Zhixia earns more than me.

193
00:08:00,599 --> 00:08:02,239
I'm not capable.

194
00:08:02,839 --> 00:08:03,919
She pays most

195
00:08:03,919 --> 00:08:05,560
of our mortgage.

196
00:08:07,520 --> 00:08:09,200
Look at yourself.

197
00:08:10,839 --> 00:08:13,560
You're useless, completely beyond help.

198
00:08:14,399 --> 00:08:15,359
I'm useless.

199
00:08:15,359 --> 00:08:16,719
I'm helping you.

200
00:08:16,719 --> 00:08:17,680
What do you mean?

201
00:08:17,680 --> 00:08:18,760
You're blaming me?

202
00:08:18,760 --> 00:08:19,719
I'm wrong?

203
00:08:20,960 --> 00:08:22,000
I'm useless.

204
00:08:44,320 --> 00:08:45,160
I'm useless.

205
00:08:56,960 --> 00:08:57,599
Mom.

206
00:08:57,839 --> 00:08:59,320
When are you coming home?

207
00:08:59,879 --> 00:09:01,479
Dad and Grandma argued.

208
00:09:02,119 --> 00:09:03,280
I'm a little scared.

209
00:09:10,239 --> 00:09:10,800
Zhixia.

210
00:09:10,800 --> 00:09:13,400
Go back if you want.

211
00:09:14,359 --> 00:09:15,040
No.

212
00:09:16,359 --> 00:09:17,680
I've imagined

213
00:09:17,680 --> 00:09:19,400
living care freely many times.

214
00:09:19,920 --> 00:09:21,200
But once I think of Jiao,

215
00:09:21,800 --> 00:09:22,920
I just can't do it.

216
00:09:23,800 --> 00:09:25,040
I managed to do it today.

217
00:09:26,239 --> 00:09:27,560
I'm not going back.

218
00:09:29,519 --> 00:09:30,160
Sure.

219
00:09:33,599 --> 00:09:34,479
Jiao.

220
00:09:34,920 --> 00:09:36,599
I'm out of town for work.

221
00:09:37,119 --> 00:09:39,639
Listen to Dad at home.

222
00:09:39,920 --> 00:09:41,479
Do your homework.

223
00:09:49,400 --> 00:09:50,800
I said I'm not going back.

224
00:09:51,800 --> 00:09:53,999
You keep turning your phone on and off.

225
00:09:53,999 --> 00:09:55,200
Aren't you tired?

226
00:09:55,200 --> 00:09:56,920
I'm worried about Jiao.

227
00:09:57,680 --> 00:09:58,800
I argued with Zhang Hao,

228
00:09:58,800 --> 00:10:00,599
but Jiao's my own child.

229
00:10:04,560 --> 00:10:05,160
Maodou.

230
00:10:05,920 --> 00:10:07,400
Look at this room.

231
00:10:07,920 --> 00:10:08,920
Isn't it nice?

232
00:10:09,440 --> 00:10:10,680
Isn't it fancy?

233
00:10:11,599 --> 00:10:12,680
Let me tell you.

234
00:10:12,920 --> 00:10:14,680
This bed is comfortable.

235
00:10:14,999 --> 00:10:15,599
Really.

236
00:10:15,759 --> 00:10:17,359
It's super soft.

237
00:10:18,800 --> 00:10:22,359
It's a waste for me to stay alone.

238
00:10:22,599 --> 00:10:24,200
That's why I asked you over for a bath.

239
00:10:24,440 --> 00:10:25,400
Still a waste.

240
00:10:25,400 --> 00:10:27,479
You should've invite
your whole family to bathe.

241
00:10:28,119 --> 00:10:29,920
Jiao loves taking baths.

242
00:10:30,440 --> 00:10:31,999
Our tiny bathroom at home

243
00:10:31,999 --> 00:10:33,920
can't even fit a wooden tub.

244
00:10:33,920 --> 00:10:34,599
Zhixia.

245
00:10:35,119 --> 00:10:36,999
Every three sentences, you mention Jiao.

246
00:10:36,999 --> 00:10:38,479
Are you here to relax

247
00:10:38,479 --> 00:10:39,879
or to torture yourself?

248
00:10:44,200 --> 00:10:44,879
Maodou.

249
00:10:45,680 --> 00:10:47,599
Do women have to

250
00:10:48,479 --> 00:10:50,680
stay trapped in marriage for their kids?

251
00:10:51,680 --> 00:10:52,400
No idea.

252
00:10:53,040 --> 00:10:55,080
But my mom always said

253
00:10:55,200 --> 00:10:56,280
she'd have left my dad

254
00:10:56,280 --> 00:10:57,320
if it weren't for me.

255
00:10:58,519 --> 00:10:59,359
And now?

256
00:10:59,639 --> 00:11:01,839
Now they're so close
that it's ridiculous.

257
00:11:01,839 --> 00:11:03,479
They nag me to date every day.

258
00:11:05,879 --> 00:11:07,599
Thinking of that,
I don't want to go home.

259
00:11:08,719 --> 00:11:10,440
Zhixia, I'm staying with you tonight.

260
00:11:10,440 --> 00:11:11,850
We two will make the room worth it.

261
00:11:12,440 --> 00:11:13,280
Call it team bonding.

262
00:11:18,560 --> 00:11:20,999
I've never seen a boss as stingy as you.

263
00:11:21,680 --> 00:11:22,719
The world's big.

264
00:11:22,920 --> 00:11:23,920
Nothing's impossible.

265
00:11:24,920 --> 00:11:25,440
No.

266
00:11:25,479 --> 00:11:26,759
Take this away.

267
00:11:26,879 --> 00:11:28,879
I have to compensate if it gets oily.

268
00:11:28,879 --> 00:11:29,719
Fine.

269
00:11:29,719 --> 00:11:31,040
I'll eat over here.

270
00:11:31,400 --> 00:11:32,440
This kid.

271
00:11:36,680 --> 00:11:38,920
You're paying
for that champagne tomorrow.

272
00:11:41,960 --> 00:11:42,920
I didn't drink it.

273
00:11:43,200 --> 00:11:45,680
I only ate what you ordered and left.

274
00:11:45,960 --> 00:11:47,519
You're so stingy.

275
00:11:47,839 --> 00:11:50,040
Like boss, like subordinate.

276
00:12:03,599 --> 00:12:04,960
Madam Wang.

277
00:12:06,040 --> 00:12:08,479
Thanks for taking care
of my mom these days.

278
00:12:08,960 --> 00:12:09,920
Please take this.

279
00:12:09,920 --> 00:12:10,759
Thank you.

280
00:12:12,160 --> 00:12:12,800
Feng.

281
00:12:14,040 --> 00:12:14,719
Come here.

282
00:12:17,719 --> 00:12:20,200
Look, I will keep half.

283
00:12:20,200 --> 00:12:22,560
Your mom still needs money later on.

284
00:12:23,239 --> 00:12:24,320
You two girls

285
00:12:24,680 --> 00:12:26,280
really have it tough.

286
00:12:26,839 --> 00:12:27,440
Alright.

287
00:12:28,119 --> 00:12:29,080
Thanks, Madam Wang.

288
00:12:29,119 --> 00:12:29,839
You're welcome.

289
00:13:02,639 --> 00:13:04,280
Our son's so disciplined.

290
00:13:04,400 --> 00:13:06,400
He hasn't streamed for days.

291
00:13:06,960 --> 00:13:08,519
He's pretty driven

292
00:13:08,599 --> 00:13:09,920
when he has his heart set.

293
00:13:10,999 --> 00:13:11,879
He's just

294
00:13:12,290 --> 00:13:13,479
not putting his heart into it,

295
00:13:14,080 --> 00:13:15,759
but he knows what matters.

296
00:13:15,759 --> 00:13:16,440
Yeah.

297
00:13:17,999 --> 00:13:20,680
Order a menu for tomorrow.

298
00:13:20,680 --> 00:13:21,680
Who ordered this?

299
00:13:22,719 --> 00:13:23,879
From Wang.

300
00:13:24,119 --> 00:13:25,839
Dad, Mom, I'm back.

301
00:13:26,400 --> 00:13:27,839
Why are you home so late?

302
00:13:30,960 --> 00:13:31,839
No, who's this?

303
00:13:33,560 --> 00:13:34,879
Where did this kid come from?

304
00:13:36,719 --> 00:13:37,280
No.

305
00:13:37,639 --> 00:13:38,599
What's going on?

306
00:13:40,359 --> 00:13:41,280
To be exact,

307
00:13:41,800 --> 00:13:43,239
he's my brother-in-law.

308
00:13:44,879 --> 00:13:45,759
What the hell?

309
00:13:52,759 --> 00:13:53,839
He really does look alike.

310
00:13:56,160 --> 00:13:57,200
Mom.

311
00:13:57,479 --> 00:13:58,599
I want Mom!

312
00:13:58,599 --> 00:13:59,359
What's wrong?

313
00:13:59,359 --> 00:14:01,719
Let me take you for a walk.

314
00:14:02,960 --> 00:14:03,999
Mom.

315
00:14:04,320 --> 00:14:05,080
He wet the bed.

316
00:14:05,119 --> 00:14:06,879
- I want Mom.
- Okay.

317
00:14:06,879 --> 00:14:07,759
Alright.

318
00:14:07,759 --> 00:14:08,560
Mom.

319
00:14:08,560 --> 00:14:09,280
What is it?

320
00:14:09,519 --> 00:14:11,359
I just want Mom.

321
00:14:11,519 --> 00:14:13,400
I want to find Mom.

322
00:14:13,879 --> 00:14:15,879
I want Mom.

323
00:14:17,400 --> 00:14:18,119
No crying.

324
00:14:19,519 --> 00:14:20,680
Aren't you a man?

325
00:14:21,200 --> 00:14:22,400
Play on the swing.

326
00:14:23,080 --> 00:14:23,719
Look.

327
00:14:24,440 --> 00:14:25,560
Fireworks, look.

328
00:14:27,280 --> 00:14:28,040
Is it fun?

329
00:14:28,119 --> 00:14:28,800
Yeah.

330
00:14:28,999 --> 00:14:29,719
No more crying?

331
00:14:30,480 --> 00:14:31,359
Will you cry tomorrow?

332
00:14:31,359 --> 00:14:32,119
No.

333
00:14:32,400 --> 00:14:33,400
You cried just now.

334
00:14:33,400 --> 00:14:34,639
You're not a man.

335
00:14:43,040 --> 00:14:43,560
Brat.

336
00:14:43,560 --> 00:14:44,719
You wet the bed last night.

337
00:14:44,719 --> 00:14:45,879
You know that?

338
00:14:46,320 --> 00:14:47,200
No.

339
00:14:50,440 --> 00:14:50,960
Here.

340
00:14:51,359 --> 00:14:52,639
No rush.

341
00:14:52,759 --> 00:14:53,359
Mom.

342
00:14:55,359 --> 00:14:56,759
Did you sleep well?

343
00:14:56,960 --> 00:14:58,599
It was okay. I'm fine.

344
00:14:58,920 --> 00:14:59,920
Come on.

345
00:15:00,479 --> 00:15:01,800
Stand up.

346
00:15:02,200 --> 00:15:02,879
Xiaoqi.

347
00:15:03,320 --> 00:15:04,519
Do you miss you mom?

348
00:15:04,920 --> 00:15:06,160
Let's call her and ask

349
00:15:06,160 --> 00:15:07,839
when she'll pick you up, okay?

350
00:15:07,839 --> 00:15:08,719
- Sit down.
- Okay.

351
00:15:09,200 --> 00:15:09,759
Sit.

352
00:15:10,200 --> 00:15:11,400
Get dressed.

353
00:15:13,639 --> 00:15:14,320
Mom.

354
00:15:14,680 --> 00:15:15,879
Are you done?

355
00:15:16,800 --> 00:15:17,680
Not yet.

356
00:15:17,759 --> 00:15:18,920
I need a few more days.

357
00:15:18,920 --> 00:15:20,160
Xiaoqi, be good.

358
00:15:20,460 --> 00:15:22,359
No, Ding Hong.
Xiaoqi can't sleep in a new bed.

359
00:15:22,359 --> 00:15:23,970
He made a fuss all night.

360
00:15:23,980 --> 00:15:25,800
Kids are like that.
The first night is tough.

361
00:15:25,800 --> 00:15:26,920
He should be fine tonight.

362
00:15:27,479 --> 00:15:27,999
No.

363
00:15:28,359 --> 00:15:30,479
We're not obliged to watch your kid.

364
00:15:31,519 --> 00:15:33,160
You're having a kid soon too.

365
00:15:33,519 --> 00:15:34,719
If no one helps you,

366
00:15:34,719 --> 00:15:35,639
would you have one?

367
00:15:36,999 --> 00:15:38,359
I've already had mine.

368
00:15:38,440 --> 00:15:39,839
When I can't watch him

369
00:15:39,839 --> 00:15:40,759
and must go out,

370
00:15:40,759 --> 00:15:41,839
what am I supposed to do?

371
00:15:41,839 --> 00:15:43,040
Throw him on the street?

372
00:15:43,040 --> 00:15:44,680
How are you still this entitled?

373
00:15:45,080 --> 00:15:46,879
When are you coming to get Xiaoqi?

374
00:15:48,119 --> 00:15:49,280
No idea. We'll see.

375
00:15:50,879 --> 00:15:53,359
Why is that woman so unreasonable?

376
00:15:53,359 --> 00:15:55,599
My mom is not unreasonable.

377
00:15:56,680 --> 00:15:58,040
I'll throw you on the street.

378
00:16:26,160 --> 00:16:26,719
Hello?

379
00:16:28,639 --> 00:16:29,479
Extend?

380
00:16:33,280 --> 00:16:34,440
It's already noon.

381
00:16:35,800 --> 00:16:36,599
Sorry.

382
00:16:37,639 --> 00:16:38,239
Let me ask

383
00:16:38,239 --> 00:16:40,320
if there's a discount for extending.

384
00:16:43,759 --> 00:16:44,759
I won't extend then.

385
00:16:45,320 --> 00:16:46,800
I'll check out now.

386
00:16:47,599 --> 00:16:48,560
Right away.

387
00:16:50,239 --> 00:16:51,560
Get up.

388
00:16:51,639 --> 00:16:52,839
We need to check out.

389
00:16:53,280 --> 00:16:55,320
Let's stay one more night, Zhixia.

390
00:16:55,320 --> 00:16:57,160
You lived care freely yesterday.

391
00:16:57,160 --> 00:16:58,479
I did, but I'm broke.

392
00:16:58,479 --> 00:16:59,080
Hurry.

393
00:16:59,080 --> 00:17:00,800
Or we'll get charged for half a day.

394
00:17:00,800 --> 00:17:01,879
Get up.

395
00:17:05,479 --> 00:17:07,479
How can you sleep this much?

396
00:17:07,820 --> 00:17:08,880
You slept until this hour.

397
00:17:08,880 --> 00:17:09,840
Aren't we young people

398
00:17:09,840 --> 00:17:11,640
supposed to eat and sleep well?

399
00:17:11,640 --> 00:17:13,600
You slept this late too.

400
00:17:13,680 --> 00:17:16,239
I haven't slept well the last few days

401
00:17:16,239 --> 00:17:17,400
sharing a bed with Jiao.

402
00:17:18,079 --> 00:17:19,600
The bed here is really comfy.

403
00:17:21,319 --> 00:17:21,920
Zhixia.

404
00:17:22,160 --> 00:17:24,200
Where are you going after checkout?

405
00:17:24,200 --> 00:17:24,960
Home?

406
00:17:26,200 --> 00:17:27,200
I'm not going back.

407
00:17:28,079 --> 00:17:29,200
I finally got out.

408
00:17:29,479 --> 00:17:31,360
I managed to live care freely for once.

409
00:17:42,200 --> 00:17:42,799
Zhixia.

410
00:17:43,880 --> 00:17:46,319
Isn't the difference a bit stark?

411
00:17:46,840 --> 00:17:48,319
Life's tough,

412
00:17:48,319 --> 00:17:50,799
but the saved money is still ours.

413
00:17:51,200 --> 00:17:51,840
Look.

414
00:17:52,319 --> 00:17:53,880
I can sit here

415
00:17:54,160 --> 00:17:55,600
and prop my feet up.

416
00:17:55,600 --> 00:17:57,160
Isn't this a bed now?

417
00:17:58,200 --> 00:17:59,160
You okay?

418
00:17:59,479 --> 00:18:01,440
Why is the stool pinching my butt?

419
00:18:02,239 --> 00:18:03,759
Bad quality, I guess.

420
00:18:03,759 --> 00:18:05,479
Second-hand stuff is like that.

421
00:18:05,719 --> 00:18:07,440
It's fine. I can do this.

422
00:18:07,590 --> 00:18:08,360
Do it the other way.

423
00:18:08,360 --> 00:18:09,039
Take it slow.

424
00:18:09,039 --> 00:18:09,880
Sit here.

425
00:18:10,239 --> 00:18:11,400
Legs up here.

426
00:18:11,640 --> 00:18:12,680
This works too.

427
00:18:12,840 --> 00:18:15,400
Cover with a blanket and sleep.

428
00:18:17,640 --> 00:18:19,880
Zhixia, I advise you to go back.

429
00:18:20,120 --> 00:18:22,880
Home may be bad, but not this bad.

430
00:18:23,559 --> 00:18:24,799
I said I won't go back.

431
00:18:25,239 --> 00:18:26,880
Middle-aged women adapt.

432
00:18:27,160 --> 00:18:28,360
They can be good to themselves

433
00:18:28,440 --> 00:18:29,640
and can be tough on themselves.

434
00:18:39,200 --> 00:18:39,960
Hello, Mom?

435
00:18:40,920 --> 00:18:42,160
Zhixia.

436
00:18:42,160 --> 00:18:43,559
Your dad called.

437
00:18:43,559 --> 00:18:44,920
Why didn't you pick up?

438
00:18:45,440 --> 00:18:46,479
Listen.

439
00:18:46,680 --> 00:18:48,479
Your brother's quitting

440
00:18:48,719 --> 00:18:50,680
and going with Bichen to Qianhu.

441
00:18:52,440 --> 00:18:54,799
Mom, do you know
I'm divorcing Zhang Hao?

442
00:19:00,880 --> 00:19:01,440
Okay.

443
00:19:01,719 --> 00:19:02,640
Which one do you want?

444
00:19:02,960 --> 00:19:04,200
I want

445
00:19:05,319 --> 00:19:06,120
this one.

446
00:19:06,120 --> 00:19:07,230
This one? You didn't get it.

447
00:19:08,239 --> 00:19:08,840
Ni.

448
00:19:08,960 --> 00:19:09,719
I'm not too sure

449
00:19:09,719 --> 00:19:10,600
if these are okay.

450
00:19:10,680 --> 00:19:12,079
Sure, no problem.

451
00:19:12,079 --> 00:19:13,880
Feng Xiaoqi, come see.

452
00:19:14,160 --> 00:19:15,319
As long as you behave,

453
00:19:15,319 --> 00:19:16,960
all this is yours.

454
00:19:19,960 --> 00:19:21,160
Why would I cry?

455
00:19:21,160 --> 00:19:22,079
I'm a man.

456
00:19:22,079 --> 00:19:23,279
Men don't cry.

457
00:19:23,279 --> 00:19:25,200
I'm filming you.

458
00:19:26,239 --> 00:19:27,160
Okay, go ahead.

459
00:19:27,600 --> 00:19:29,120
I, Feng Xiaoqi, promise

460
00:19:29,120 --> 00:19:30,559
I definitely won't cry.

461
00:19:31,120 --> 00:19:32,120
Okay.

462
00:19:32,120 --> 00:19:32,880
Here, hold this.

463
00:19:32,880 --> 00:19:34,039
Pick what you want to eat.

464
00:19:34,840 --> 00:19:36,360
Choose what you want.

465
00:19:36,680 --> 00:19:37,279
Hu Gang.

466
00:19:37,680 --> 00:19:39,400
Your dad's upright, right?

467
00:19:40,600 --> 00:19:41,519
Of course.

468
00:19:41,600 --> 00:19:42,440
Can you promise

469
00:19:42,440 --> 00:19:44,319
you don't have illegitimate siblings?

470
00:19:45,999 --> 00:19:47,079
Of course not.

471
00:19:48,120 --> 00:19:50,239
Dad had a vasectomy long ago.

472
00:19:51,519 --> 00:19:53,519
He's a good man then.

473
00:19:54,559 --> 00:19:55,559
I learn from my dad.

474
00:19:55,600 --> 00:19:56,600
I learn from my dad.

475
00:20:18,319 --> 00:20:18,960
Mingzhu.

476
00:20:19,160 --> 00:20:20,920
Feng Xiaoqi wants me
to record a promise.

477
00:20:21,719 --> 00:20:23,239
I, Feng Xiaoqi, promise

478
00:20:23,239 --> 00:20:24,519
I definitely won't cry.

479
00:20:25,279 --> 00:20:26,160
Okay.

480
00:20:53,799 --> 00:20:55,519
Xiaoqi, stop messing around.

481
00:20:56,120 --> 00:20:57,239
You'll fall later.

482
00:20:57,239 --> 00:20:58,120
Hear me?

483
00:20:58,120 --> 00:21:00,799
It's fine. I won't fall.

484
00:21:14,039 --> 00:21:15,039
Mingzhu, I'm back.

485
00:21:18,400 --> 00:21:19,360
How's Mom today?

486
00:21:20,079 --> 00:21:20,479
Better.

487
00:21:20,519 --> 00:21:21,200
Give it to me.

488
00:21:26,039 --> 00:21:26,719
Come down.

489
00:21:28,039 --> 00:21:28,719
Come down.

490
00:21:30,420 --> 00:21:31,360
I told you to come down.

491
00:21:31,360 --> 00:21:32,600
Can't you hear me?

492
00:21:34,360 --> 00:21:34,960
Stand properly!

493
00:21:37,279 --> 00:21:38,680
I can't do anything here.

494
00:21:38,680 --> 00:21:39,920
I want Mom.

495
00:21:39,920 --> 00:21:40,960
Hurry up.

496
00:21:41,600 --> 00:21:43,279
Is your mom fit to be a mom?

497
00:21:43,999 --> 00:21:45,440
Don't talk about my mom like that.

498
00:21:45,440 --> 00:21:46,079
Don't...

499
00:21:46,079 --> 00:21:46,920
Stop it!

500
00:21:47,239 --> 00:21:48,479
Move again, I'll throw you out.

501
00:21:51,360 --> 00:21:52,319
This brat.

502
00:21:52,600 --> 00:21:54,079
He has no manners at all.

503
00:22:00,160 --> 00:22:01,239
Dare you try again?

504
00:22:12,160 --> 00:22:13,960
This house is not bad, Honey.

505
00:22:14,519 --> 00:22:15,719
Yeah, this price

506
00:22:16,120 --> 00:22:17,160
is a real bargain.

507
00:22:18,239 --> 00:22:20,120
The house is nice,

508
00:22:20,120 --> 00:22:22,160
but I'm buying it
as my son's wedding home.

509
00:22:22,310 --> 00:22:23,960
- I'm afraid...
- Let's check that side.

510
00:22:23,960 --> 00:22:25,640
Foreclosed homes are unlucky.

511
00:22:26,239 --> 00:22:26,920
Right.

512
00:22:26,920 --> 00:22:28,600
I heard in this house,

513
00:22:28,600 --> 00:22:30,759
the son died then the father died.

514
00:22:30,759 --> 00:22:31,360
Really?

515
00:22:31,799 --> 00:22:33,640
Then it's not suitable
as a wedding home.

516
00:22:34,360 --> 00:22:35,470
- We need to think.
- Yeah.

517
00:22:36,600 --> 00:22:37,799
But the space is big.

518
00:22:37,799 --> 00:22:39,039
Look here. Isn't this...

519
00:22:40,920 --> 00:22:41,680
I...

520
00:22:41,680 --> 00:22:42,640
The renovation...

521
00:22:42,640 --> 00:22:44,440
I've always wanted a river-view home.

522
00:22:44,440 --> 00:22:44,920
Yes.

523
00:22:44,920 --> 00:22:45,479
Right?

524
00:22:45,799 --> 00:22:47,519
This place has a sofa set.

525
00:22:47,519 --> 00:22:49,400
The layout is really good.

526
00:22:49,400 --> 00:22:50,319
Environment's nice too.

527
00:22:50,519 --> 00:22:51,759
The lighting outside.

528
00:22:51,759 --> 00:22:52,360
Yes.

529
00:22:52,440 --> 00:22:53,279
Very open.

530
00:22:53,279 --> 00:22:54,680
Just a few issues.

531
00:22:54,680 --> 00:22:55,680
Everything else is good.

532
00:22:55,680 --> 00:22:56,640
Indeed, yes.

533
00:22:57,039 --> 00:22:57,860
It's especially nice.

534
00:22:58,719 --> 00:22:59,239
This...

535
00:23:00,239 --> 00:23:01,600
We need a feng shui expert here.

536
00:23:02,079 --> 00:23:02,600
Feng shui.

537
00:23:02,600 --> 00:23:05,239
Mom says I own half of this big house.

538
00:23:06,719 --> 00:23:07,400
All yours.

539
00:23:07,559 --> 00:23:08,680
Great.

540
00:23:08,680 --> 00:23:10,680
Dad says I have a good sister.

541
00:23:10,680 --> 00:23:12,160
He wasn't lying.

542
00:23:16,799 --> 00:23:17,519
Sis.

543
00:23:18,160 --> 00:23:20,999
But my dad is dead.

544
00:23:25,840 --> 00:23:26,440
Go home.

545
00:23:33,999 --> 00:23:34,920
Behave.

546
00:23:37,239 --> 00:23:37,840
Go back.

547
00:24:12,440 --> 00:24:12,999
Next.

548
00:24:12,999 --> 00:24:13,840
8051.

549
00:24:16,799 --> 00:24:18,239
Sit there and wait for me.

550
00:24:18,360 --> 00:24:19,120
Be good.

551
00:24:20,560 --> 00:24:21,960
ID and household registration book.

552
00:24:22,640 --> 00:24:23,440
ID.

553
00:24:24,340 --> 00:24:25,460
Household registration book.

554
00:24:25,740 --> 00:24:27,060
(Resident Death Certificate Feng Zhi)

555
00:24:28,840 --> 00:24:29,559
Dad, Mom.

556
00:24:30,160 --> 00:24:31,680
Hello, Grandpa, Grandma.

557
00:24:33,680 --> 00:24:35,640
Here comes the bed-wetter again.

558
00:24:36,640 --> 00:24:37,600
What are you here for?

559
00:24:37,600 --> 00:24:38,840
To play.

560
00:24:39,279 --> 00:24:40,479
You're here to play?

561
00:24:40,820 --> 00:24:42,920
Meiqi is taking my mother-in-law
for physiotherapy.

562
00:24:43,039 --> 00:24:44,279
I need to go to the pharmacy.

563
00:24:44,559 --> 00:24:46,680
There's no one to watch this kid.

564
00:24:47,479 --> 00:24:48,640
Are we not people?

565
00:24:49,039 --> 00:24:50,880
Just leave him here. Go.

566
00:24:51,160 --> 00:24:51,719
Mom.

567
00:24:51,880 --> 00:24:53,759
He has his cup and toys here.

568
00:24:54,039 --> 00:24:54,999
Behave here.

569
00:24:54,999 --> 00:24:56,160
Don't run around, got it?

570
00:24:56,160 --> 00:24:57,680
Yes, Mingzhu.

571
00:24:57,680 --> 00:24:58,600
I'm leaving.

572
00:24:58,610 --> 00:24:59,400
Eat something first.

573
00:24:59,400 --> 00:25:00,880
No, I don't have time.

574
00:25:01,999 --> 00:25:03,160
You call her Mingzhu.

575
00:25:03,519 --> 00:25:04,559
You call me Grandpa.

576
00:25:05,920 --> 00:25:06,360
Grandpa.

577
00:25:06,360 --> 00:25:08,960
Can I play on the swing outside a bit?

578
00:25:09,759 --> 00:25:10,960
Of course.

579
00:25:10,960 --> 00:25:11,440
Is that okay?

580
00:25:11,440 --> 00:25:13,680
Just don't go too close to the water.

581
00:25:14,400 --> 00:25:15,440
- Is that okay?
- Go.

582
00:25:15,440 --> 00:25:15,999
It's okay.

583
00:25:16,719 --> 00:25:17,999
Don't wander too far.

584
00:25:18,360 --> 00:25:19,600
Come when called.

585
00:25:22,079 --> 00:25:23,319
No matter how tired,

586
00:25:23,600 --> 00:25:25,600
we'll bring you home.

587
00:25:26,200 --> 00:25:27,440
No matter how tired,

588
00:25:27,719 --> 00:25:29,719
we'll bring you home.

589
00:25:30,400 --> 00:25:32,999
I have to bring you troublemaker home.

590
00:25:34,559 --> 00:25:35,400
What are you here for?

591
00:25:38,239 --> 00:25:39,279
Deliver equipment?

592
00:25:39,880 --> 00:25:41,600
Want me to keep roaming outside?

593
00:25:41,840 --> 00:25:42,559
No.

594
00:25:43,120 --> 00:25:44,860
You don't want
to come home with me either,

595
00:25:45,079 --> 00:25:46,880
so I sent myself over.

596
00:25:49,270 --> 00:25:50,600
The milk's almost expired, right?

597
00:25:50,680 --> 00:25:51,479
Impossible.

598
00:25:57,759 --> 00:25:59,600
Heaven closes a door for me.

599
00:26:00,759 --> 00:26:03,079
It will surely open a window.

600
00:26:04,079 --> 00:26:04,759
Ms. Xu.

601
00:26:06,559 --> 00:26:07,719
Listen to me.

602
00:26:07,719 --> 00:26:09,039
Jiao misses you.

603
00:26:09,039 --> 00:26:10,880
She asks me every day
when you'll be back.

604
00:26:10,880 --> 00:26:12,400
How do I even tell her?

605
00:26:12,999 --> 00:26:13,920
Stop.

606
00:26:14,559 --> 00:26:16,360
I want to set an example for Jiao.

607
00:26:16,759 --> 00:26:19,279
I want her to know a woman can't
be held hostage by her child,

608
00:26:19,279 --> 00:26:21,920
can't take every grievance silently,
can't always suffer first

609
00:26:21,920 --> 00:26:22,840
and enjoy later.

610
00:26:22,840 --> 00:26:24,079
You're so right.

611
00:26:24,079 --> 00:26:25,279
I totally agree.

612
00:26:25,759 --> 00:26:27,479
And my mom

613
00:26:27,479 --> 00:26:29,239
isn't really sexist.

614
00:26:29,239 --> 00:26:30,999
Maybe a little.

615
00:26:30,999 --> 00:26:32,160
She's just stubborn.

616
00:26:32,160 --> 00:26:34,160
She wants to sort out the family assets.

617
00:26:34,580 --> 00:26:35,559
Your mom's stubbornness

618
00:26:35,559 --> 00:26:36,999
hits my weak spot perfectly.

619
00:26:37,400 --> 00:26:39,200
I've always been hard to manage.

620
00:26:39,210 --> 00:26:42,220
Had I been born later, the one sent
away from our family would have been me.

621
00:26:42,239 --> 00:26:43,200
No way.

622
00:26:43,640 --> 00:26:44,279
Zhixia.

623
00:26:45,120 --> 00:26:45,840
Well...

624
00:26:47,120 --> 00:26:47,759
See.

625
00:26:48,600 --> 00:26:49,719
You lost your temper again.

626
00:26:50,440 --> 00:26:50,999
Fine.

627
00:26:51,479 --> 00:26:52,680
You're not going back, right?

628
00:26:53,160 --> 00:26:54,039
You're not going back.

629
00:26:54,640 --> 00:26:56,200
I may not be good at much,

630
00:26:56,479 --> 00:26:57,759
but I excel at keeping company.

631
00:26:58,559 --> 00:27:00,039
I'm going nowhere today.

632
00:27:00,120 --> 00:27:01,160
I'll stay at the door.

633
00:27:01,279 --> 00:27:02,479
We'll be a perfect pair.

634
00:27:02,479 --> 00:27:03,880
I'll stay with you. I'll sleep here.

635
00:27:04,079 --> 00:27:05,079
I even brought a bed.

636
00:27:05,759 --> 00:27:06,519
Alright?

637
00:27:06,840 --> 00:27:07,680
I'm not leaving.

638
00:27:08,279 --> 00:27:09,120
I...

639
00:27:13,660 --> 00:27:14,880
I left it at the door for you.

640
00:27:14,880 --> 00:27:16,559
I tried it. It's quite comfortable.

641
00:27:18,039 --> 00:27:18,840
Cooking?

642
00:27:19,160 --> 00:27:20,200
Yes.

643
00:27:20,200 --> 00:27:21,440
These radishes look fresh.

644
00:27:21,440 --> 00:27:21,999
Yes.

645
00:27:22,799 --> 00:27:23,279
Okay.

646
00:27:23,279 --> 00:27:24,920
- Okay.
- Help out more when you can.

647
00:27:24,920 --> 00:27:25,799
Don't worry.

648
00:27:25,999 --> 00:27:27,200
Cook something nice later.

649
00:27:27,200 --> 00:27:28,479
No need. Do your thing.

650
00:27:28,840 --> 00:27:29,920
This chive is good too.

651
00:27:32,079 --> 00:27:34,200
My dad and Mr. Shen are brothers.

652
00:27:34,360 --> 00:27:37,440
I get to decide who gets
to play on this swing.

653
00:27:38,360 --> 00:27:40,279
Xiaoni, can I play?

654
00:27:40,279 --> 00:27:41,079
Yes.

655
00:27:41,079 --> 00:27:41,999
Doudou, get down.

656
00:27:41,999 --> 00:27:42,920
Xiaoqi, go.

657
00:27:45,440 --> 00:27:45,880
Doudou.

658
00:27:45,880 --> 00:27:47,519
If you want to swing, push it first.

659
00:27:47,519 --> 00:27:49,440
No work, no play.

660
00:27:49,600 --> 00:27:50,999
Why should I listen to you?

661
00:27:51,479 --> 00:27:52,400
Because you have to.

662
00:27:52,400 --> 00:27:54,039
Dad said I'm the oldest here.

663
00:27:54,039 --> 00:27:55,160
Everyone listens to me.

664
00:27:55,239 --> 00:27:57,600
My dad said your dad
profits off people's deaths.

665
00:27:57,719 --> 00:27:59,079
We can't listen to him.

666
00:27:59,079 --> 00:28:00,120
You're talking nonsense.

667
00:28:00,120 --> 00:28:01,200
Your dad's a big liar.

668
00:28:01,200 --> 00:28:02,279
How dare you bully Xiaoni?

669
00:28:02,279 --> 00:28:03,039
You're the liar.

670
00:28:03,039 --> 00:28:03,880
What are you doing?

671
00:28:05,680 --> 00:28:06,640
Gang fight.

672
00:28:06,640 --> 00:28:07,799
I'll count to three, let go.

673
00:28:08,920 --> 00:28:09,559
Stop fighting.

674
00:28:09,559 --> 00:28:10,160
Three.

675
00:28:10,719 --> 00:28:11,719
Let go.

676
00:28:11,719 --> 00:28:13,120
Xiaoqi, let go.

677
00:28:13,120 --> 00:28:14,120
Minghui.

678
00:28:14,120 --> 00:28:17,279
Doudou said my dad
profits off people's deaths.

679
00:28:18,160 --> 00:28:18,920
Who's Doudou?

680
00:28:19,920 --> 00:28:20,799
You're Doudou?

681
00:28:21,400 --> 00:28:23,079
Whose kid are you? How rude.

682
00:28:23,239 --> 00:28:24,999
He lives across the river.

683
00:28:25,600 --> 00:28:26,840
You live across the river?

684
00:28:27,200 --> 00:28:28,880
You come to our house to play

685
00:28:29,319 --> 00:28:30,239
and cause trouble.

686
00:28:30,440 --> 00:28:32,640
Xiaoni wouldn't let me play first.

687
00:28:32,880 --> 00:28:34,759
I said no, you go away.

688
00:28:35,239 --> 00:28:37,239
Fine, wait and see.

689
00:28:37,239 --> 00:28:38,999
I'm going home to tell my parents.

690
00:28:39,120 --> 00:28:40,880
Go ahead.

691
00:28:41,400 --> 00:28:42,999
Fine, wait and see.

692
00:28:42,999 --> 00:28:44,039
We'll wait.

693
00:28:45,719 --> 00:28:46,799
Break it up.

694
00:28:47,079 --> 00:28:47,759
Feng Xiaoqi.

695
00:28:47,760 --> 00:28:49,120
Mingzhu wants me to bring you home.

696
00:28:49,120 --> 00:28:49,719
Let's go.

697
00:28:50,759 --> 00:28:51,719
Have fun.

698
00:28:51,799 --> 00:28:53,360
No more fighting, Xiaoni.

699
00:28:53,799 --> 00:28:54,600
Be careful.

700
00:28:54,600 --> 00:28:55,160
Okay.

701
00:28:55,319 --> 00:28:55,960
Bye.

702
00:28:56,999 --> 00:28:58,400
Push slowly.

703
00:29:00,400 --> 00:29:01,079
Get in.

704
00:29:11,120 --> 00:29:11,680
Here.

705
00:29:12,519 --> 00:29:13,160
Mingzhu.

706
00:29:14,200 --> 00:29:15,440
Your brother-in-law's back.

707
00:29:16,759 --> 00:29:18,680
Mingzhu, I'm home.

708
00:29:19,039 --> 00:29:20,039
You're back.

709
00:29:20,279 --> 00:29:21,400
Were you good today?

710
00:29:21,680 --> 00:29:22,519
Very good.

711
00:29:23,060 --> 00:29:24,500
He just finished a fight with Doudou.

712
00:29:24,519 --> 00:29:25,600
He fought?

713
00:29:26,120 --> 00:29:27,279
No fighting, okay?

714
00:29:27,279 --> 00:29:28,719
You need to reason with Doudou.

715
00:29:28,719 --> 00:29:30,400
Reasoning won't work with him.

716
00:29:30,440 --> 00:29:31,239
You have to fight.

717
00:29:31,640 --> 00:29:32,920
Don't be a bad influence.

718
00:29:33,479 --> 00:29:34,400
Don't listen to him.

719
00:29:35,279 --> 00:29:37,039
Mingzhu, you're busy.

720
00:29:37,400 --> 00:29:38,960
Why not let Xiaoqi stay at our place?

721
00:29:39,039 --> 00:29:40,360
He has food and fun here.

722
00:29:40,360 --> 00:29:41,440
Fights too.

723
00:29:42,440 --> 00:29:43,600
He's a boy.

724
00:29:43,999 --> 00:29:45,519
They can't grow up without fighting.

725
00:29:45,519 --> 00:29:46,719
Don't listen to him.

726
00:29:47,120 --> 00:29:48,400
Alright, you better head back.

727
00:29:48,400 --> 00:29:48,999
Okay.

728
00:29:49,719 --> 00:29:50,360
I'll go then.

729
00:29:50,360 --> 00:29:51,239
Be careful.

730
00:29:52,999 --> 00:29:53,479
Bye.

731
00:29:53,479 --> 00:29:54,079
- Bye.
- Bye.

732
00:29:54,079 --> 00:29:54,920
Xiaoqi, bye.

733
00:30:00,319 --> 00:30:02,079
Where did you get hit? Does it hurt?

734
00:30:02,319 --> 00:30:02,960
No.

735
00:30:03,680 --> 00:30:05,200
You can't get hurt, okay?

736
00:30:05,680 --> 00:30:06,400
If you get hurt,

737
00:30:06,400 --> 00:30:08,160
people will think we're abusing you.

738
00:30:08,360 --> 00:30:09,640
Abusing?

739
00:30:10,759 --> 00:30:12,479
Abusing means bullying a child.

740
00:30:12,640 --> 00:30:14,759
Mingzhu, you treat me so well.

741
00:30:15,079 --> 00:30:17,120
It's fine if Mom doesn't pick me up.

742
00:30:24,600 --> 00:30:25,239
Xiaoni.

743
00:30:25,799 --> 00:30:26,759
Haven't gone home?

744
00:30:27,999 --> 00:30:28,840
Miaomiao said

745
00:30:28,840 --> 00:30:30,440
Doudou went home to get backup.

746
00:30:30,440 --> 00:30:31,640
I'm waiting for him.

747
00:30:32,440 --> 00:30:33,559
He went home to get backup?

748
00:30:34,039 --> 00:30:34,640
It's fine.

749
00:30:34,999 --> 00:30:35,999
I'm here.

750
00:30:36,120 --> 00:30:38,360
However many come, I'll beat that many.

751
00:30:38,840 --> 00:30:39,519
Really?

752
00:30:40,880 --> 00:30:41,920
Hit one and show me.

753
00:30:44,120 --> 00:30:44,759
Lu Bing.

754
00:30:46,079 --> 00:30:47,759
No, why are you here?

755
00:30:48,840 --> 00:30:49,759
I can't be here?

756
00:30:52,160 --> 00:30:52,799
Xiaoni.

757
00:30:52,920 --> 00:30:53,840
Come here.

758
00:30:54,759 --> 00:30:55,759
This is Lu Bing.

759
00:30:56,079 --> 00:30:57,120
Lu Bing.

760
00:30:57,120 --> 00:30:58,600
She hit me.

761
00:30:58,600 --> 00:31:00,120
He scolded me.

762
00:31:00,120 --> 00:31:01,440
Help me get revenge.

763
00:31:02,200 --> 00:31:04,200
Alright. Revenge.

764
00:31:04,640 --> 00:31:05,759
How do we do that?

765
00:31:07,279 --> 00:31:07,999
Doudou.

766
00:31:08,360 --> 00:31:09,479
We're all family.

767
00:31:09,479 --> 00:31:11,360
It was just a misunderstanding, right?

768
00:31:12,719 --> 00:31:13,400
Xiaoni.

769
00:31:13,960 --> 00:31:16,039
Revenge never ends.

770
00:31:16,279 --> 00:31:17,400
Let's be generous.

771
00:31:17,840 --> 00:31:19,719
Didn't you say you'd help me?

772
00:31:21,279 --> 00:31:23,160
Fighting won't solve anything.

773
00:31:23,519 --> 00:31:25,279
Look at everyone now.

774
00:31:25,279 --> 00:31:26,840
We're family. Shake hands.

775
00:31:26,840 --> 00:31:27,719
Then we're good.

776
00:31:27,719 --> 00:31:29,479
We stay good friends, right?

777
00:31:29,479 --> 00:31:31,319
Who wants to be good friends with him?

778
00:31:39,360 --> 00:31:39,999
Doudou.

779
00:31:41,519 --> 00:31:44,400
Boys don't fuss with girls.

780
00:31:44,400 --> 00:31:45,039
Right?

781
00:31:45,880 --> 00:31:47,319
I'll take you to swing.

782
00:31:47,319 --> 00:31:48,039
Alright?

783
00:31:48,479 --> 00:31:49,640
Okay then.

784
00:31:49,640 --> 00:31:50,160
Come on.

785
00:31:54,079 --> 00:31:55,200
Minghui's the best.

786
00:31:55,239 --> 00:31:55,880
Right?

787
00:31:58,360 --> 00:31:59,400
Having fun, Doudou?

788
00:31:59,440 --> 00:32:00,079
Yeah.

789
00:32:01,039 --> 00:32:03,559
Come with Lu Bing more often then.

790
00:32:04,039 --> 00:32:04,880
Got it?

791
00:32:17,920 --> 00:32:19,479
Mingzhu, I'm back.

792
00:32:19,479 --> 00:32:20,479
You're back.

793
00:32:21,039 --> 00:32:22,400
Where's the lollipop from?

794
00:32:22,880 --> 00:32:24,519
My sister bought it for me.

795
00:32:25,600 --> 00:32:26,840
One yuan each.

796
00:32:28,400 --> 00:32:30,600
She also bought me ice cream.

797
00:32:30,719 --> 00:32:32,120
Eight yuan each.

798
00:32:32,600 --> 00:32:33,360
So much sugar.

799
00:32:33,360 --> 00:32:34,710
Are you trying to lose your teeth?

800
00:32:34,960 --> 00:32:36,799
I want all his teeth to rot.

801
00:32:38,039 --> 00:32:38,519
No.

802
00:32:38,519 --> 00:32:41,039
You said I should brush my teeth well.

803
00:32:41,880 --> 00:32:43,880
Enough talking. Wash your hands.

804
00:32:44,400 --> 00:32:44,999
Come on.

805
00:32:46,160 --> 00:32:46,799
Wash your hands.

806
00:32:55,600 --> 00:32:56,160
Let's go.

807
00:32:57,479 --> 00:32:58,479
You all eat first.

808
00:32:58,840 --> 00:33:00,999
I'm staying at the hospital tonight.

809
00:33:01,479 --> 00:33:02,840
Put Xiaoqi to bed a bit earlier.

810
00:33:03,239 --> 00:33:04,519
I'll relieve you after dinner.

811
00:33:04,519 --> 00:33:05,920
You're pregnant.
You can't stay overnight.

812
00:33:05,920 --> 00:33:06,519
It's fine.

813
00:33:06,519 --> 00:33:07,680
I took a nap this afternoon.

814
00:33:07,680 --> 00:33:08,999
You haven't slept for days.

815
00:33:09,200 --> 00:33:09,759
Be good.

816
00:33:10,719 --> 00:33:12,400
Be good. Hear me?

817
00:33:13,759 --> 00:33:14,759
Eat later.

818
00:33:14,840 --> 00:33:15,799
Bye, Mingzhu.

819
00:33:15,799 --> 00:33:16,279
Bye.

820
00:33:16,279 --> 00:33:17,200
Be careful, Mingzhu.

821
00:33:19,600 --> 00:33:20,640
Eat some vegetable.

822
00:33:20,640 --> 00:33:22,400
You only eat meat.

823
00:33:23,479 --> 00:33:24,640
Here. Eat this.

824
00:33:30,920 --> 00:33:31,519
Mom.

825
00:33:32,239 --> 00:33:33,519
Why are you sitting up?

826
00:33:38,840 --> 00:33:40,160
I got tired of lying.

827
00:33:41,840 --> 00:33:42,680
Good timing.

828
00:33:43,200 --> 00:33:44,920
Let's eat first.

829
00:33:50,160 --> 00:33:51,519
We need to eat well

830
00:33:52,279 --> 00:33:53,799
and work with the doctors.

831
00:33:54,239 --> 00:33:55,799
Then you'll be able to go home soon.

832
00:33:58,759 --> 00:33:59,519
Go home.

833
00:34:02,680 --> 00:34:03,640
Which home?

834
00:34:13,280 --> 00:34:15,119
Here. Eat while it's hot.

835
00:34:20,960 --> 00:34:21,720
Don't worry.

836
00:34:22,400 --> 00:34:24,159
This bracelet must be real.

837
00:34:29,999 --> 00:34:31,960
Did I do something wrong?

838
00:34:33,199 --> 00:34:33,840
No.

839
00:34:34,999 --> 00:34:36,519
You did nothing wrong.

840
00:34:38,199 --> 00:34:40,240
Dad must have
run into something outside.

841
00:34:48,800 --> 00:34:49,519
Lies.

842
00:34:51,119 --> 00:34:51,960
More lies.

843
00:34:54,679 --> 00:34:55,880
They're all nothing.

844
00:35:11,920 --> 00:35:12,880
As long as one lives

845
00:35:14,999 --> 00:35:15,999
and is around,

846
00:35:17,240 --> 00:35:18,880
everything else is nothing

847
00:35:20,720 --> 00:35:21,519
and not important.

848
00:35:24,679 --> 00:35:26,720
(It'd be easier if Jianqi only cheated.)

849
00:35:27,400 --> 00:35:28,360
(As long as he's here,)

850
00:35:28,760 --> 00:35:30,119
(everything else is nothing.)

851
00:36:33,840 --> 00:36:36,159
No wonder sleeping with you
felt like lifting rice.

852
00:36:36,320 --> 00:36:37,240
I'm exhausted.

853
00:36:38,800 --> 00:36:39,840
Lost your stance?

854
00:36:41,559 --> 00:36:44,039
He said he's scared at night
and insisted on sleeping with me.

855
00:36:45,720 --> 00:36:48,360
I think he's pretty pitiful too.

856
00:36:49,559 --> 00:36:50,519
No dad.

857
00:36:50,920 --> 00:36:51,999
Mom's unreliable.

858
00:36:53,559 --> 00:36:54,479
Just like me.

859
00:36:56,559 --> 00:36:57,519
How's Mom?

860
00:36:58,559 --> 00:36:59,559
Getting better.

861
00:37:04,760 --> 00:37:05,519
Class.

862
00:37:06,400 --> 00:37:08,199
Your third mock exam results are out.

863
00:37:08,999 --> 00:37:10,280
Our class average

864
00:37:10,360 --> 00:37:11,880
is now top four in the grade.

865
00:37:11,880 --> 00:37:12,360
How is it?

866
00:37:12,840 --> 00:37:14,159
That's major progress.

867
00:37:14,159 --> 00:37:14,920
Pretty good.

868
00:37:15,880 --> 00:37:16,720
But

869
00:37:16,920 --> 00:37:19,639
some didn't do well this time.

870
00:37:20,159 --> 00:37:22,199
I hope they don't lose heart.

871
00:37:22,240 --> 00:37:23,479
Keep working hard.

872
00:37:23,760 --> 00:37:26,280
Ask me anytime if you don't understand.

873
00:37:26,519 --> 00:37:27,039
Alright?

874
00:37:27,679 --> 00:37:29,599
- Okay.
- Okay.

875
00:37:29,960 --> 00:37:31,639
Come on. Open today's textbook.

876
00:37:31,639 --> 00:37:35,340
(Physics: 58 points)

877
00:37:38,440 --> 00:37:39,240
Hello.

878
00:37:39,559 --> 00:37:40,240
Hello.

879
00:37:40,240 --> 00:37:41,800
I'm a student from Nanzhou High School.

880
00:37:42,960 --> 00:37:44,240
My score for the third mock exam

881
00:37:44,240 --> 00:37:45,999
in the science stream
is around 326 points.

882
00:37:46,800 --> 00:37:49,199
May I ask what schools I can apply for?

883
00:37:49,660 --> 00:37:51,960
Last year, the science-track cutoff
for bachelor programs

884
00:37:51,960 --> 00:37:53,360
is 448 points.

885
00:37:54,079 --> 00:37:55,720
Your total

886
00:37:56,159 --> 00:37:56,880
of 326...

887
00:37:57,440 --> 00:37:58,840
Let's not talk academics.

888
00:37:59,240 --> 00:38:00,599
One goal, good jobs.

889
00:38:01,479 --> 00:38:02,519
We won't talk jobs.

890
00:38:02,639 --> 00:38:04,679
Getting a job isn't a big deal for me.

891
00:38:05,240 --> 00:38:07,519
I just want to know if I get into

892
00:38:07,780 --> 00:38:09,679
any bachelor's degree program
with this score.

893
00:38:10,800 --> 00:38:11,440
Impossible.

894
00:38:11,800 --> 00:38:13,160
You can try a vocational college.

895
00:38:13,920 --> 00:38:14,519
Bye.

896
00:38:20,840 --> 00:38:21,479
Feng Xiaoqi.

897
00:38:22,119 --> 00:38:22,840
Want some?

898
00:38:23,240 --> 00:38:23,960
No.

899
00:38:24,400 --> 00:38:26,119
I just ate.

900
00:38:26,519 --> 00:38:27,679
It's a waste of money.

901
00:38:28,880 --> 00:38:30,679
So young and already so frugal.

902
00:38:31,240 --> 00:38:32,519
I want one. I'll buy it.

903
00:38:34,639 --> 00:38:35,159
Miss.

904
00:38:35,159 --> 00:38:36,760
This one tastes better.

905
00:38:37,519 --> 00:38:38,720
Alright. This one.

906
00:38:39,639 --> 00:38:40,479
Feng Xiaoqi.

907
00:38:41,679 --> 00:38:42,880
Mom!

908
00:38:43,800 --> 00:38:44,519
Son.

909
00:38:46,999 --> 00:38:47,679
Son.

910
00:38:48,320 --> 00:38:49,360
Did you miss me?

911
00:38:49,519 --> 00:38:51,519
Yeah. I miss you every day.

912
00:38:52,880 --> 00:38:53,720
Candy again?

913
00:38:53,720 --> 00:38:55,320
Did you brush your teeth tonight?

914
00:38:55,320 --> 00:38:55,840
Yes.

915
00:38:55,840 --> 00:38:56,760
You brushed?

916
00:38:57,880 --> 00:38:58,639
Give me a hug.

917
00:38:58,840 --> 00:38:59,360
Come here.

918
00:39:00,960 --> 00:39:02,519
You're heavier now.

919
00:39:06,159 --> 00:39:07,999
When I had Xiaoqi,

920
00:39:08,440 --> 00:39:09,440
Feng bought me a shop

921
00:39:09,440 --> 00:39:10,999
in my hometown.

922
00:39:11,800 --> 00:39:13,159
I went back and sold it.

923
00:39:13,519 --> 00:39:14,400
After paying the loan,

924
00:39:14,400 --> 00:39:16,400
I have 448,200 yuan.

925
00:39:17,840 --> 00:39:19,199
Why are you telling us?

926
00:39:21,880 --> 00:39:23,999
Because half of it belongs to your mom.

927
00:39:25,720 --> 00:39:26,800
I saved it in an account.

928
00:39:27,199 --> 00:39:28,639
Use it for Mrs. Feng's treatment.

929
00:39:32,639 --> 00:39:35,079
But we're taking our share

930
00:39:35,519 --> 00:39:37,360
of Feng's insurance payout.

931
00:39:37,660 --> 00:39:38,720
They're separate matters.

932
00:39:40,599 --> 00:39:42,360
The insurance isn't much.

933
00:39:43,199 --> 00:39:44,050
After splitting it up,

934
00:39:44,210 --> 00:39:46,250
each family could get
a maximum of over 50,000 yuan.

935
00:39:46,320 --> 00:39:47,159
I know.

936
00:39:48,880 --> 00:39:51,159
The amount doesn't matter anymore.

937
00:39:55,320 --> 00:39:56,639
What matters is fairness.

938
00:40:02,519 --> 00:40:04,840
I didn't bring Xiaoqi home

939
00:40:06,120 --> 00:40:07,519
partly because of the flight price.

940
00:40:07,999 --> 00:40:09,119
But more importantly,

941
00:40:09,119 --> 00:40:10,039
that shop

942
00:40:10,119 --> 00:40:11,720
used to be rented to a tea house.

943
00:40:12,280 --> 00:40:14,639
Then the tea house
sublet to a mahjong parlor.

944
00:40:15,240 --> 00:40:16,320
The parlor owner

945
00:40:16,320 --> 00:40:17,720
is a local thug.

946
00:40:17,720 --> 00:40:18,840
He's difficult to deal with.

947
00:40:19,280 --> 00:40:20,760
I knew selling the place

948
00:40:21,479 --> 00:40:23,280
wouldn't go smoothly.

949
00:40:24,679 --> 00:40:25,440
Anyway,

950
00:40:25,440 --> 00:40:26,760
I spent a lot of time

951
00:40:26,760 --> 00:40:27,999
sorting it out.

952
00:40:28,840 --> 00:40:29,840
Thank you

953
00:40:32,199 --> 00:40:33,760
for taking care of Xiaoqi.

954
00:40:35,280 --> 00:40:35,920
Alright.

955
00:40:36,479 --> 00:40:38,519
Now that we handed over Xiaoqi to you,

956
00:40:38,720 --> 00:40:39,840
we can relax.

957
00:40:40,639 --> 00:40:42,840
No more worrying every single day.

958
00:40:44,679 --> 00:40:45,800
Xiaoqi's well behaved.

959
00:40:46,039 --> 00:40:47,720
He didn't trouble us.

960
00:40:51,039 --> 00:40:53,320
When I'm not busy,

961
00:40:54,479 --> 00:40:55,920
I chat with Xiaoqi

962
00:40:56,599 --> 00:40:58,240
and tell him how good you two are.

963
00:40:59,960 --> 00:41:01,479
If you ever treat him bad,

964
00:41:01,960 --> 00:41:03,440
I'll come back and take him.

965
00:41:08,760 --> 00:41:10,440
The card password is Feng's birthday.

966
00:41:11,199 --> 00:41:12,519
Just transfer the money.

967
00:41:21,440 --> 00:41:23,479
Take the money.

968
00:41:25,119 --> 00:41:26,119
Even if I deny it,

969
00:41:26,119 --> 00:41:27,639
you'd find out sooner or later.

970
00:41:28,240 --> 00:41:30,199
Just like I found out
about the insurance.

971
00:41:31,280 --> 00:41:33,639
So let's split everything clean and clear.

972
00:41:34,320 --> 00:41:36,800
The Feng family and I

973
00:41:37,039 --> 00:41:38,760
go our separate ways.

974
00:41:39,079 --> 00:41:40,360
We'll never see each other again.

975
00:41:58,159 --> 00:41:58,760
Alright.

976
00:42:00,519 --> 00:42:01,519
We'll get going then.

977
00:42:05,320 --> 00:42:06,280
- Xiaoqi.
- Ding Hong.

978
00:42:06,999 --> 00:42:07,880
Hold on.

979
00:42:11,119 --> 00:42:12,360
Xiaoqi, let's go. Come here.

980
00:42:19,240 --> 00:42:20,159
My father-in-law

981
00:42:20,440 --> 00:42:22,119
left this gold lock to Xiaoqi.

982
00:42:24,519 --> 00:42:25,840
His birthday is engraved on it.

983
00:42:40,720 --> 00:42:41,400
Thank you.
