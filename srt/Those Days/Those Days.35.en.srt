=Episode 35=

4
00:01:18,559 --> 00:01:19,160
Mom.

5
00:01:21,919 --> 00:01:22,520
Mom.

6
00:01:36,640 --> 00:01:37,240
Sorry.

7
00:01:37,399 --> 00:01:39,839
The number you have dialed
is temporarily unavailable.

8
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:41,240
Please try again later.

9
00:01:49,679 --> 00:01:50,360
Auntie.

10
00:01:50,880 --> 00:01:52,399
Have you seen where my mom went?

11
00:01:52,720 --> 00:01:53,759
Isn't she upstairs?

12
00:01:53,880 --> 00:01:54,720
No.

13
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:57,240
I just saw her.

14
00:01:58,360 --> 00:01:59,520
Minghui's not here either.

15
00:01:59,759 --> 00:02:02,360
He came back just now. Messed around,
grabbed a couple of things.

16
00:02:02,360 --> 00:02:03,479
I don't know where he went.

17
00:02:03,720 --> 00:02:04,479
Don't mind him.

18
00:02:04,480 --> 00:02:05,039
You must be hungry.

19
00:02:05,039 --> 00:02:06,039
I will make you something to eat.

20
00:02:06,039 --> 00:02:07,000
No need, Auntie.

21
00:02:07,119 --> 00:02:08,439
I'll call Minghui.

22
00:02:15,920 --> 00:02:16,640
Pick up.

23
00:02:20,480 --> 00:02:21,240
Hello? Minghui?

24
00:02:21,240 --> 00:02:22,320
Have you seen my Mom?

25
00:02:23,159 --> 00:02:24,599
Auntie is with me.

26
00:02:25,879 --> 00:02:26,999
She asked me to go with her

27
00:02:26,999 --> 00:02:28,360
to see some acupuncture master.

28
00:02:29,599 --> 00:02:31,200
What master? Where did he come from?

29
00:02:31,360 --> 00:02:32,960
In the mountains, it'll take a few days.

30
00:02:33,520 --> 00:02:35,360
Make sure she remembers
to take her medicine.

31
00:02:35,559 --> 00:02:36,839
Okay, I'll take good care of her.

32
00:02:37,159 --> 00:02:37,999
Don't worry.

33
00:02:38,279 --> 00:02:39,040
Bye.

34
00:02:40,520 --> 00:02:41,760
Kid, you're something.

35
00:02:41,760 --> 00:02:43,420
You can make up stories
on the spot, huh?

36
00:02:43,960 --> 00:02:44,520
Fine.

37
00:02:54,879 --> 00:02:56,159
Poor little baby.

38
00:02:56,480 --> 00:02:58,360
Just born and already has
to suffer so much.

39
00:03:02,480 --> 00:03:03,760
It hurts when I bite myself.

40
00:03:04,320 --> 00:03:05,760
How could surgery not hurt him?

41
00:03:06,760 --> 00:03:07,879
If it hurts, he'll cry.

42
00:03:08,360 --> 00:03:09,320
But crying won't help.

43
00:03:09,760 --> 00:03:11,240
And we won't even know what he means.

44
00:03:13,480 --> 00:03:14,439
It's all my fault.

45
00:03:14,999 --> 00:03:16,119
I am not ambitious.

46
00:03:16,839 --> 00:03:17,800
Not only that,

47
00:03:18,420 --> 00:03:19,480
I also loves spicy strips.

48
00:03:23,159 --> 00:03:25,159
Do you think maybe the doctor
made a mistake?

49
00:03:25,520 --> 00:03:27,119
Maybe the extra finger

50
00:03:27,240 --> 00:03:28,599
is actually just a spicy strip.

51
00:03:43,040 --> 00:03:43,559
Jiao.

52
00:03:43,559 --> 00:03:44,559
Call Mommy for dinner.

53
00:03:45,640 --> 00:03:47,200
Mom, come out for dinner.

54
00:03:49,999 --> 00:03:51,719
I'm not hungry, you eat.

55
00:03:52,279 --> 00:03:53,320
You need to eat.

56
00:03:53,320 --> 00:03:54,999
You're not alone now.

57
00:04:01,960 --> 00:04:02,760
Come eat.

58
00:04:04,559 --> 00:04:05,200
Mom.

59
00:04:05,719 --> 00:04:07,839
Does the baby really have six fingers?

60
00:04:08,920 --> 00:04:09,439
You...

61
00:04:10,080 --> 00:04:11,360
It's written right there.

62
00:04:14,119 --> 00:04:14,999
Did you take it out?

63
00:04:15,679 --> 00:04:16,839
I'm the Sister.

64
00:04:17,200 --> 00:04:18,320
I have the right to know.

65
00:04:22,359 --> 00:04:23,599
Let me tell you something.

66
00:04:23,919 --> 00:04:25,080
This is a golden finger.

67
00:04:28,239 --> 00:04:29,080
Really.

68
00:04:29,239 --> 00:04:31,039
Lv Dongbin can turn stones into gold.

69
00:04:34,640 --> 00:04:35,239
Lv...

70
00:04:36,399 --> 00:04:38,399
Lv Dongbin can turn stones into gold

71
00:04:38,399 --> 00:04:41,520
because he's an immortal.

72
00:04:41,520 --> 00:04:42,359
Not because...

73
00:04:43,159 --> 00:04:45,200
Not because he had an extra finger.

74
00:04:45,599 --> 00:04:46,640
My daughter's right.

75
00:04:47,760 --> 00:04:49,919
If Jiao says it's a golden finger,
then it is.

76
00:05:12,440 --> 00:05:13,839
Hello, baby.

77
00:05:16,039 --> 00:05:16,960
He kicked me.

78
00:05:19,839 --> 00:05:21,239
He likes you.

79
00:05:22,039 --> 00:05:23,159
Tonight I want to sleep

80
00:05:23,159 --> 00:05:24,640
with Mommy and the baby.

81
00:05:25,359 --> 00:05:26,320
Okay.

82
00:05:27,080 --> 00:05:28,159
Baby, look.

83
00:05:28,719 --> 00:05:29,960
I'm your sister.

84
00:05:30,399 --> 00:05:31,399
This is Mommy.

85
00:05:32,239 --> 00:05:33,320
I'm Peppa.

86
00:05:33,640 --> 00:05:34,599
You're George.

87
00:05:36,200 --> 00:05:38,599
Our mom is very beautiful.

88
00:05:39,520 --> 00:05:41,039
But she's not very gentle.

89
00:05:41,520 --> 00:05:42,719
You need to be careful.

90
00:05:44,799 --> 00:05:46,159
I am going to sleep now.

91
00:05:46,680 --> 00:05:47,399
Good night.

92
00:06:32,799 --> 00:06:33,839
Don't worry.

93
00:06:34,200 --> 00:06:35,479
Didn't the doctor say

94
00:06:36,359 --> 00:06:38,200
he can have surgery after three months?

95
00:06:41,039 --> 00:06:43,159
He's so little but having surgery...

96
00:06:45,080 --> 00:06:46,060
With general anesthesia.

97
00:06:46,960 --> 00:06:48,239
Such a big risk.

98
00:06:48,250 --> 00:06:49,399
What if something goes wrong?

99
00:06:52,110 --> 00:06:53,080
What if when he grows up,

100
00:06:53,080 --> 00:06:54,599
he blames me?

101
00:06:54,599 --> 00:06:56,560
No, he won't. How could he blame you?

102
00:06:58,000 --> 00:06:59,080
Even if we...

103
00:06:59,080 --> 00:07:01,320
Even if we don't do the surgery,
it's fine.

104
00:07:01,880 --> 00:07:02,239
Right?

105
00:07:02,239 --> 00:07:04,399
It's not like the baby
is missing anything.

106
00:07:04,399 --> 00:07:06,000
He just has an extra finger.

107
00:07:06,120 --> 00:07:07,599
Six fingers, look.

108
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:09,479
Six is a very lucky number.

109
00:07:09,479 --> 00:07:10,399
Smooth and successful.

110
00:07:10,839 --> 00:07:11,799
Success all the way.

111
00:07:13,399 --> 00:07:13,960
And look,

112
00:07:13,960 --> 00:07:16,279
I think our baby will
definitely be very lively.

113
00:07:16,279 --> 00:07:17,760
Just like my personality.

114
00:07:17,760 --> 00:07:19,599
You see how he grows "extra branches".

115
00:07:20,039 --> 00:07:20,760
Right?

116
00:07:27,880 --> 00:07:28,599
It's okay.

117
00:07:30,039 --> 00:07:31,479
Everything will be fine.

118
00:07:32,719 --> 00:07:33,599
It's all my fault.

119
00:07:34,279 --> 00:07:36,719
Is it because my temper is too bad

120
00:07:36,719 --> 00:07:40,680
that the baby grew an extra finger?

121
00:07:41,159 --> 00:07:41,960
It's not your fault.

122
00:07:42,760 --> 00:07:43,399
It's mine.

123
00:07:44,919 --> 00:07:45,719
All my fault.

124
00:07:58,399 --> 00:08:00,159
Where exactly are we going?

125
00:08:02,239 --> 00:08:03,960
Stop.

126
00:08:04,960 --> 00:08:05,799
It's right here.

127
00:08:05,960 --> 00:08:06,799
Where is this?

128
00:08:06,919 --> 00:08:09,479
According to Meiqi's location post,

129
00:08:10,239 --> 00:08:11,599
it should be this place.

130
00:08:12,120 --> 00:08:12,880
So?

131
00:08:14,479 --> 00:08:16,799
Lawyer Yao must be working here.

132
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:19,799
Are you sure?

133
00:08:20,039 --> 00:08:20,599
No.

134
00:08:21,200 --> 00:08:23,200
No? Then why did you bring me here now?

135
00:08:23,640 --> 00:08:24,919
It's so late already.

136
00:08:24,919 --> 00:08:26,200
People are off work by now.

137
00:08:26,799 --> 00:08:28,000
We'll just wait here?

138
00:08:28,919 --> 00:08:30,359
We'll come back again tomorrow.

139
00:08:30,599 --> 00:08:31,279
Tomorrow?

140
00:08:31,440 --> 00:08:32,080
Tomorrow.

141
00:08:32,170 --> 00:08:33,950
We'd have to stay one more night
in Shanghai?

142
00:08:34,440 --> 00:08:35,359
Do you have money?

143
00:08:35,759 --> 00:08:36,400
No.

144
00:08:36,479 --> 00:08:37,999
No money, where do we stay?

145
00:08:38,680 --> 00:08:39,879
Don't you have money?

146
00:08:40,040 --> 00:08:40,719
Me?

147
00:08:42,810 --> 00:08:45,200
I'm still a kid. Auntie, I'm onl
in 5th year of high school.

148
00:08:45,200 --> 00:08:46,280
How would I have money?

149
00:08:46,280 --> 00:08:48,160
People graduate after 3rd year.

150
00:08:48,160 --> 00:08:49,280
You're already in 5th year.

151
00:08:49,280 --> 00:08:50,680
You must have money.

152
00:08:52,879 --> 00:08:53,639
I don't have money.

153
00:09:01,440 --> 00:09:02,999
Then think of something.

154
00:09:04,599 --> 00:09:05,479
You can do it.

155
00:09:17,599 --> 00:09:18,200
Hello?

156
00:09:19,359 --> 00:09:21,970
Mr. Ni. I want to discuss a business deal
with you.

157
00:09:21,980 --> 00:09:28,860
(Xiushui Hotel)

158
00:09:30,479 --> 00:09:32,160
Xiushui Hotel.

159
00:09:32,519 --> 00:09:33,359
Let's go, Auntie.

160
00:09:34,110 --> 00:09:34,960
I'm not staying there.

161
00:09:36,350 --> 00:09:37,599
Then where do you want to stay?

162
00:09:39,879 --> 00:09:41,440
I want to stay in a five-star hotel.

163
00:09:42,119 --> 00:09:43,400
A five-star hotel?

164
00:09:43,999 --> 00:09:45,160
Given our situation?

165
00:09:45,160 --> 00:09:47,080
We can't afford a five-star hotel.

166
00:09:47,080 --> 00:09:48,479
Then I'm not staying here either.

167
00:09:48,560 --> 00:09:49,639
It's just a place to rest.

168
00:09:49,639 --> 00:09:51,440
Just make do. Does it matter that much?

169
00:09:51,440 --> 00:09:52,239
It does.

170
00:09:52,400 --> 00:09:53,160
I'm not staying.

171
00:09:53,160 --> 00:09:54,839
I'm only staying in a five-star hotel.

172
00:09:55,960 --> 00:09:57,359
But we don't have enough money.

173
00:09:57,719 --> 00:09:58,839
You can only stay one night.

174
00:09:59,479 --> 00:10:00,759
We'd even have to share a room.

175
00:10:01,220 --> 00:10:02,440
Are you okay with that, Auntie?

176
00:10:02,440 --> 00:10:03,400
I'm fine with it.

177
00:10:03,999 --> 00:10:05,759
I can share a room with you.

178
00:10:05,960 --> 00:10:07,160
What's the big deal?

179
00:10:07,320 --> 00:10:08,759
One night is fine.

180
00:10:09,160 --> 00:10:10,560
Aren't you good at borrowing money?

181
00:10:10,800 --> 00:10:11,999
Then borrow again tomorrow.

182
00:10:12,239 --> 00:10:13,759
Money isn't that easy to borrow.

183
00:10:15,119 --> 00:10:16,350
You talk like you borrowed it.

184
00:10:17,119 --> 00:10:17,999
You borrowed it.

185
00:10:18,759 --> 00:10:19,440
Come on.

186
00:10:19,879 --> 00:10:20,639
Where?

187
00:10:21,280 --> 00:10:22,719
The five-star hotel, of course.

188
00:10:22,719 --> 00:10:23,359
Let's go.

189
00:10:24,400 --> 00:10:24,999
Uh.

190
00:10:25,200 --> 00:10:27,280
Is it really okay for us
to share one room?

191
00:10:27,280 --> 00:10:28,560
What's the problem?

192
00:10:28,999 --> 00:10:30,519
If my third child had lived,

193
00:10:30,519 --> 00:10:31,839
he'd be about your age.

194
00:10:31,839 --> 00:10:32,639
It's fine.

195
00:10:32,640 --> 00:10:33,950
You'll have to pay me back though.

196
00:10:34,239 --> 00:10:35,519
Why are you so stingy?

197
00:10:40,879 --> 00:10:41,560
Mrs. Feng.

198
00:10:42,239 --> 00:10:43,400
You asked to meet me today,

199
00:10:44,599 --> 00:10:46,920
whatever it is, just say it directly.

200
00:10:48,320 --> 00:10:49,080
Yes.

201
00:10:49,719 --> 00:10:50,320
Mr. Wang.

202
00:10:50,320 --> 00:10:51,440
Long time no see.

203
00:10:52,479 --> 00:10:53,119
Well.

204
00:10:53,999 --> 00:10:55,239
The debt our family owed

205
00:10:56,479 --> 00:10:57,719
all paid off.

206
00:10:57,839 --> 00:10:58,719
Did you know?

207
00:10:58,999 --> 00:10:59,759
I'm aware.

208
00:11:00,440 --> 00:11:01,879
It's indeed all settled.

209
00:11:03,839 --> 00:11:05,800
So the reason I invited you today

210
00:11:05,800 --> 00:11:08,680
is to talk about a cooperation.

211
00:11:10,440 --> 00:11:11,119
Here's the thing.

212
00:11:11,479 --> 00:11:12,320
Right now in my hands,

213
00:11:12,320 --> 00:11:14,519
I have a batch of high-quality silk.

214
00:11:15,680 --> 00:11:17,080
I want to use this batch

215
00:11:17,800 --> 00:11:19,759
to revive Jianmei Workshop.

216
00:11:20,999 --> 00:11:22,320
I need your help.

217
00:11:23,200 --> 00:11:24,479
I wonder if you're willing

218
00:11:24,479 --> 00:11:25,800
to work with us again.

219
00:11:28,400 --> 00:11:28,999
Mrs. Feng.

220
00:11:29,879 --> 00:11:31,960
I truly understand your determination

221
00:11:32,200 --> 00:11:33,119
to make a comeback.

222
00:11:33,719 --> 00:11:34,839
But this kind of thing

223
00:11:34,839 --> 00:11:37,879
can't be achieved just by understanding.

224
00:11:38,839 --> 00:11:40,320
Manpower, resources, capital.

225
00:11:40,879 --> 00:11:41,999
Which one is easy?

226
00:11:42,800 --> 00:11:44,440
Feng built it step by step,

227
00:11:44,680 --> 00:11:46,519
you know how hard

228
00:11:46,680 --> 00:11:47,960
it was.

229
00:11:49,080 --> 00:11:50,800
Even if we take ten thousand steps back,

230
00:11:51,239 --> 00:11:53,200
you have the silk,

231
00:11:53,599 --> 00:11:54,599
you have start-up funds,

232
00:11:55,400 --> 00:11:56,639
but who will run things?

233
00:11:59,080 --> 00:11:59,759
Mr. Wang.

234
00:12:00,359 --> 00:12:01,999
Here's how I see it.

235
00:12:02,599 --> 00:12:04,999
Look, I have the goods now.

236
00:12:05,680 --> 00:12:08,080
Jianmei Workshop's machines
are all there.

237
00:12:09,519 --> 00:12:10,800
You watched me

238
00:12:10,879 --> 00:12:12,999
build this with Feng.

239
00:12:13,119 --> 00:12:14,119
I have experience.

240
00:12:15,160 --> 00:12:16,160
Most importantly,

241
00:12:16,479 --> 00:12:17,960
I have the will.

242
00:12:18,400 --> 00:12:20,479
This time I must succeed.

243
00:12:20,479 --> 00:12:21,400
No failure allowed.

244
00:12:22,359 --> 00:12:23,119
As for manpower,

245
00:12:23,960 --> 00:12:24,839
I have it.

246
00:12:25,479 --> 00:12:26,200
I do.

247
00:12:27,080 --> 00:12:29,999
My daughter Meiqi has returned
from her studies in the UK.

248
00:12:32,200 --> 00:12:33,839
After everything she went through,

249
00:12:34,759 --> 00:12:37,320
she's completely transformed.

250
00:12:38,400 --> 00:12:40,280
And this is our family business.

251
00:12:40,280 --> 00:12:43,080
She'll definitely devote herself
to the workshop.

252
00:12:44,160 --> 00:12:45,680
Young people have seen the world.

253
00:12:46,200 --> 00:12:47,519
They have taste,

254
00:12:47,839 --> 00:12:49,040
and new ideas.

255
00:12:51,599 --> 00:12:52,680
Of course, Mr. Wang.

256
00:12:52,999 --> 00:12:55,680
The most important thing is still you.

257
00:12:57,560 --> 00:13:00,160
If you're willing to help
Feng family once more,

258
00:13:01,119 --> 00:13:01,920
I believe

259
00:13:02,839 --> 00:13:04,119
our Jianmei Workshop

260
00:13:04,119 --> 00:13:06,479
will definitely rise again.

261
00:13:07,080 --> 00:13:07,719
Definitely.

262
00:13:10,119 --> 00:13:12,200
Mrs. Feng. You're putting
a lot of pressure on me.

263
00:13:15,759 --> 00:13:16,479
How about this?

264
00:13:17,359 --> 00:13:19,400
You prepare a proposal first.

265
00:13:19,680 --> 00:13:20,519
I'll take a look.

266
00:13:21,440 --> 00:13:22,400
After I review it,

267
00:13:22,400 --> 00:13:24,839
we'll decide on the next step
of cooperation.

268
00:13:25,160 --> 00:13:25,879
How about that?

269
00:13:25,960 --> 00:13:27,560
Okay, thank you, Mr. Wang.

270
00:13:27,680 --> 00:13:29,800
I'll send you the proposal
as soon as possible.

271
00:13:30,200 --> 00:13:31,839
Thank you very much.

272
00:13:31,999 --> 00:13:32,639
Mrs. Feng.

273
00:13:33,119 --> 00:13:35,239
It's still too early
to say these things.

274
00:13:36,460 --> 00:13:37,560
I'll wait for the proposal.

275
00:13:37,800 --> 00:13:38,400
Alright.

276
00:13:40,080 --> 00:13:42,479
I have something else to do,
I'll get going.

277
00:13:42,800 --> 00:13:43,359
Okay.

278
00:13:43,680 --> 00:13:45,200
Thank you so much.

279
00:13:45,200 --> 00:13:46,239
- Thank you.
- Goodbye.

280
00:13:46,239 --> 00:13:48,359
Thank you. Sorry to trouble you
to come all the way.

281
00:13:48,560 --> 00:13:49,239
It's fine.

282
00:13:49,239 --> 00:13:51,119
I'll send you the proposal soon.

283
00:13:51,119 --> 00:13:51,879
Alright.

284
00:13:51,879 --> 00:13:52,519
Thanks.

285
00:13:59,479 --> 00:14:00,119
Auntie.

286
00:14:00,620 --> 00:14:02,879
Now I understand
why you insist on staying in this hotel.

287
00:14:04,239 --> 00:14:05,320
Learn this.

288
00:14:05,639 --> 00:14:07,560
People don't do business
with the fallen.

289
00:14:07,800 --> 00:14:09,839
Even if one day I truly fall,

290
00:14:09,839 --> 00:14:11,999
I must still keep my dignity.

291
00:14:13,160 --> 00:14:13,960
Got it.

292
00:14:14,400 --> 00:14:15,200
You've got style.

293
00:14:15,719 --> 00:14:16,800
Only "a bit"?

294
00:14:17,080 --> 00:14:18,920
But I'd rather never need to use it.

295
00:14:21,160 --> 00:14:21,920
Mr. Zhu.

296
00:14:26,080 --> 00:14:27,080
You've worked hard today.

297
00:14:27,080 --> 00:14:29,400
The leaders were very satisfied
with today's tasting.

298
00:14:30,320 --> 00:14:31,400
As they should be.

299
00:14:32,440 --> 00:14:35,479
I still want to talk to you
about the compensation package.

300
00:14:37,560 --> 00:14:39,080
Didn't we already discuss that?

301
00:14:40,479 --> 00:14:41,680
Please tell me the truth.

302
00:14:42,200 --> 00:14:44,200
Why did you quote such a low price?

303
00:14:47,560 --> 00:14:48,639
Mr. Xu

304
00:14:49,519 --> 00:14:51,040
is my lifesaver?

305
00:14:52,479 --> 00:14:53,440
Our cooperation

306
00:14:53,440 --> 00:14:55,479
should be built on mutual trust.

307
00:14:55,479 --> 00:14:56,080
Right?

308
00:14:56,719 --> 00:14:57,639
If you act like this,

309
00:14:57,759 --> 00:14:58,999
I can't feel at ease.

310
00:15:04,680 --> 00:15:06,280
Xu said

311
00:15:07,239 --> 00:15:09,800
he would cover the 20,000 yuan
difference for me.

312
00:15:17,860 --> 00:15:22,119
(Shanghai Hongtai Law Firm)

313
00:15:22,119 --> 00:15:23,440
Hello, who are you looking for?

314
00:15:23,560 --> 00:15:24,200
Hello.

315
00:15:24,440 --> 00:15:25,519
I'm looking for Lawyer Yao.

316
00:15:25,800 --> 00:15:26,639
Lawyer Yao?

317
00:15:29,239 --> 00:15:30,800
We don't have Lawyer Yao here.

318
00:15:32,180 --> 00:15:33,639
Then I must've found the wrong place.

319
00:15:33,639 --> 00:15:34,879
Sorry.

320
00:15:34,879 --> 00:15:35,560
Take care.

321
00:15:36,440 --> 00:15:37,320
Okay, thank you.

322
00:15:51,040 --> 00:15:51,719
Hello, sir.

323
00:15:51,719 --> 00:15:53,400

Hello, I'm looking for Lawyer Yao.

00:15:57,160 --> 00:15:57,999
Alright, sir.

326
00:15:58,200 --> 00:15:59,239
May I ask your surname?

327
00:15:59,639 --> 00:16:00,639
My surname is Shen.

328
00:16:02,040 --> 00:16:03,200
Alright, Mr. Shen.

329
00:16:03,300 --> 00:16:04,639
Please help me hurry this through.

330
00:16:04,839 --> 00:16:05,639
Yes.

There's a Mr. Shen at reception
asking for you.

333
00:16:10,879 --> 00:16:12,040
Okay, I got it.

334
00:16:12,760 --> 00:16:14,519
Mr. Shen, sorry.
Sorry to keep you waiting.

This way, please.

336
00:16:15,280 --> 00:16:15,839
Okay.

337
00:16:21,119 --> 00:16:21,879
This way, please.

338
00:16:21,879 --> 00:16:22,440
Okay.

00:16:30,839 --> 00:16:31,560
Ms. Yao.

341
00:16:32,239 --> 00:16:32,879
Come in.

342
00:16:33,280 --> 00:16:33,960
Lawyer...

343
00:16:38,759 --> 00:16:39,680
Lawyer Yao.

344
00:16:39,839 --> 00:16:41,879
Sorry, I found the wrong person again.

345
00:16:42,040 --> 00:16:42,639
Sorry.

346
00:16:50,839 --> 00:16:51,639
Lawyer Yao.

347
00:16:56,759 --> 00:16:57,440
Sister.

348
00:16:58,280 --> 00:16:59,719
I really have something

349
00:16:59,719 --> 00:17:01,200
need to consult you about.

350
00:17:01,860 --> 00:17:03,920
Do you know you need
to make an appointment first?

351
00:17:05,120 --> 00:17:05,840
I'm sorry,

352
00:17:05,840 --> 00:17:07,799
but my issue is really urgent.

353
00:17:09,200 --> 00:17:11,039
Are there other Lawyer Yao
in your industry?

354
00:17:11,920 --> 00:17:12,640
Male ones.

355
00:17:14,160 --> 00:17:15,840
Yes, quite a few.

356
00:17:16,239 --> 00:17:17,600
Do you know all of them?

357
00:17:19,479 --> 00:17:20,759
Let me make this clear.

358
00:17:20,999 --> 00:17:22,160
My consultation fee

359
00:17:22,160 --> 00:17:23,239
is 1,000 yuan per hour.

360
00:17:23,540 --> 00:17:25,920
If it's less than an hour,
it's still charged as 1,000 yuan.

361
00:17:26,960 --> 00:17:27,719
Money opens doors,

362
00:17:27,719 --> 00:17:28,719
my dad told me that.

363
00:17:28,719 --> 00:17:29,880
I understand that principle.

364
00:17:30,999 --> 00:17:33,600
I'll definitely find a way to pay you.

365
00:17:35,039 --> 00:17:36,440
I'm joking with you.

366
00:17:36,460 --> 00:17:37,920
You're just here to ask about someone.

367
00:17:37,920 --> 00:17:39,880
Why would I charge you
a consultation fee?

368
00:17:39,880 --> 00:17:41,039
Thank you, Lawyer Yao.

369
00:17:41,880 --> 00:17:42,479

375
00:18:37,319 --> 00:18:39,039
Mingzhu, hurry!

376
00:18:39,039 --> 00:18:39,680
Hurry, hurry!

377
00:18:39,680 --> 00:18:41,079
Slow down.

378
00:18:41,079 --> 00:18:42,519
Slow down. Sit down.

379
00:18:42,680 --> 00:18:44,400
Here, take off your bag.

380
00:18:44,479 --> 00:18:45,360
Sit.

381
00:18:45,799 --> 00:18:46,559
Sit here.

382
00:18:49,680 --> 00:18:51,600
Don't just stand there.
Get her some water!

383
00:18:51,600 --> 00:18:52,400
And some food!

384
00:18:52,559 --> 00:18:53,680
No need, everyone.

385
00:18:54,600 --> 00:18:56,680
No need to fuss.
I have something to say.

386
00:18:56,680 --> 00:18:58,400
She says no need,
she has something to say!

387
00:18:58,400 --> 00:18:59,360
Okay.

388
00:18:59,479 --> 00:19:00,719
Alright.

389
00:19:06,759 --> 00:19:08,279
Mr. Zhu already told me.

390
00:19:09,680 --> 00:19:11,239
What's wrong with Zhu?

391
00:19:11,239 --> 00:19:12,360
I already told him clearly.

392
00:19:12,360 --> 00:19:14,160
Business is business.

393
00:19:14,799 --> 00:19:16,519
This money should be paid by me.

394
00:19:17,079 --> 00:19:18,039
In a few more months,

395
00:19:18,360 --> 00:19:19,840
when business at my shop picks up,

396
00:19:20,239 --> 00:19:21,559
I won't feel so pressured then.

397
00:19:21,559 --> 00:19:22,279
Child,

398
00:19:22,680 --> 00:19:24,360
what will you do now if you need money

399
00:19:24,360 --> 00:19:25,400
and don't have enough?

400
00:19:25,400 --> 00:19:27,400
- If it's not enough, I'll ask you again.
- Then take it.

401
00:19:27,400 --> 00:19:28,920
If you see me as family,

402
00:19:29,400 --> 00:19:30,799
then take this money back.

403
00:19:31,160 --> 00:19:31,920
We're family.

404
00:19:31,920 --> 00:19:33,519
We are absolutely a family.

405
00:19:33,519 --> 00:19:35,600
Alright, put the money away first.
Put it away.

406
00:19:35,719 --> 00:19:37,239
Don't make her anxious.

407
00:19:45,640 --> 00:19:47,120
About that note...

408
00:19:49,519 --> 00:19:51,039
My mom told me the truth.

409
00:19:54,079 --> 00:19:54,999
She also felt

410
00:19:54,999 --> 00:19:55,698
(No. 68, Wenzhong Avenue, Xidi Road,)

411
00:19:55,722 --> 00:19:56,440
(Old Town District, Nanzhou City.
March 26, 1994)

412
00:19:56,440 --> 00:19:57,999
that hiding this from you

413
00:19:58,999 --> 00:20:00,400
made you suffer.

414
00:20:01,880 --> 00:20:02,960
I came today

415
00:20:03,479 --> 00:20:04,519
to apologize on her behalf.

416
00:20:05,200 --> 00:20:06,759
Say sorry to you.

417
00:20:07,920 --> 00:20:08,519
No.

418
00:20:09,479 --> 00:20:10,160
No.

419
00:20:13,400 --> 00:20:14,759
She didn't give birth to me,

420
00:20:15,880 --> 00:20:17,880
but I understand why she did so.

421
00:20:18,759 --> 00:20:20,079
She truly loved me too much.

422
00:20:21,920 --> 00:20:22,840
When I was young,

423
00:20:22,999 --> 00:20:24,999
people said I wasn't her real child.

424
00:20:25,519 --> 00:20:27,880
She took a kitchen knife
and fought for me.

425
00:20:29,360 --> 00:20:31,519
She never meant to hurt you.

426
00:20:32,160 --> 00:20:32,759
We know.

427
00:20:33,719 --> 00:20:34,680
We know.

428
00:20:37,120 --> 00:20:38,920
When I was young, I resented you too.

429
00:20:39,719 --> 00:20:40,519
I thought,

430
00:20:41,840 --> 00:20:43,799
why did you abandon me at birth?

431
00:20:44,360 --> 00:20:45,120
No...

432
00:20:45,200 --> 00:20:45,559
We...

433
00:20:45,559 --> 00:20:47,719
We truly didn't know.

434
00:20:48,060 --> 00:20:48,719
If we had known,

435
00:20:48,719 --> 00:20:50,039
we would've risked our lives,

436
00:20:50,039 --> 00:20:51,759
we would never have let you go.

437
00:20:51,759 --> 00:20:52,239
Child.

438
00:20:52,239 --> 00:20:53,479
We really didn't know.

439
00:20:53,600 --> 00:20:54,960
Later I understood,

440
00:20:56,400 --> 00:20:58,319
although I didn't grow up with you,

441
00:20:59,400 --> 00:21:00,279
I received from them

442
00:21:00,279 --> 00:21:01,840
the most precious thing.

443
00:21:02,920 --> 00:21:03,960
No matter who I am,

444
00:21:03,960 --> 00:21:05,079
no matter good or bad,

445
00:21:05,440 --> 00:21:07,319
I received unconditional love.

446
00:21:10,160 --> 00:21:11,160
These past months,

447
00:21:12,360 --> 00:21:13,519
all the kindness you gave me,

448
00:21:13,840 --> 00:21:15,160
I remember it all.

449
00:21:16,840 --> 00:21:19,079
And you even bought me such
an expensive bangle.

450
00:21:20,279 --> 00:21:21,719
I was truly moved.

451
00:21:23,440 --> 00:21:24,680
I often think,

452
00:21:25,479 --> 00:21:26,640
what have I done

453
00:21:27,319 --> 00:21:29,319
to deserve the love of two pairs
of parents?

454
00:21:33,519 --> 00:21:34,920
I also want to care for you,

455
00:21:35,680 --> 00:21:38,519
but I'm afraid of making
the two moms uncomfortable.

456
00:21:40,519 --> 00:21:42,519
No, child,

457
00:21:43,239 --> 00:21:44,200
Child, you...

458
00:21:44,200 --> 00:21:46,239
You really think this way?

459
00:21:46,759 --> 00:21:47,400
You...

460
00:21:48,440 --> 00:21:49,479
You don't blame us?

461
00:21:50,759 --> 00:21:51,759
I don't blame you now.

462
00:21:52,759 --> 00:21:54,160
Everything is clear now.

463
00:21:54,840 --> 00:21:56,479
From now on, we're a family.

464
00:21:57,479 --> 00:21:59,279
A family.

465
00:21:59,640 --> 00:22:00,319
From now on,

466
00:22:01,400 --> 00:22:03,239
please continue to look after me,

467
00:22:03,239 --> 00:22:04,079
your daughter.

468
00:22:06,640 --> 00:22:07,279
Daughter.

469
00:22:08,559 --> 00:22:09,160
Daughter.

470
00:22:09,559 --> 00:22:11,039
Child, you keep us in your heart.

471
00:22:11,039 --> 00:22:12,400
We're satisfied.

472
00:22:12,559 --> 00:22:13,840
Yes.

473
00:22:14,680 --> 00:22:15,319
That's right.

474
00:22:19,079 --> 00:22:19,719
Good.

475
00:22:21,920 --> 00:22:22,719
Child.

476
00:22:24,640 --> 00:22:26,799
You coming today to say all this.

477
00:22:26,799 --> 00:22:28,319
Really, in my heart, I...

478
00:22:28,519 --> 00:22:29,079
I…

479
00:22:30,079 --> 00:22:31,999
I'm so happy.

480
00:22:31,999 --> 00:22:34,479
I'm truly so happy, child.

481
00:22:35,640 --> 00:22:37,600
Take this note with you.

482
00:22:37,799 --> 00:22:39,519
Tell your mom,

483
00:22:40,920 --> 00:22:43,039
I'm a rough person.

484
00:22:43,920 --> 00:22:45,719
Whatever I said before,

485
00:22:45,719 --> 00:22:47,360
don't let her take it to heart.

486
00:22:51,840 --> 00:22:53,120
Your mom is right.

487
00:22:53,519 --> 00:22:54,799
If not for them,

488
00:22:56,880 --> 00:22:59,840
I wouldn't have
such an outstanding daughter.

489
00:23:04,799 --> 00:23:05,519
Daughter.

490
00:23:16,160 --> 00:23:16,960
What's going on?

491
00:23:16,970 --> 00:23:18,460
Why couldn't you say it on the phone?

492
00:23:18,640 --> 00:23:19,640
You insisted I come home.

493
00:23:20,640 --> 00:23:21,999
The four-dimensional scan is out.

494
00:23:22,799 --> 00:23:25,559
What is the attitude of you two now
towards this result?

495
00:23:26,920 --> 00:23:28,160
What do you mean?

496
00:23:28,560 --> 00:23:30,400
No matter if the baby
has five fingers or six,

497
00:23:30,400 --> 00:23:31,239
we're having it.

498
00:23:33,200 --> 00:23:34,160
I asked already.

499
00:23:34,239 --> 00:23:36,440
This is definitely related to genetics.

500
00:23:37,320 --> 00:23:39,160
You need to thoroughly check
Zhixia's family.

501
00:23:39,160 --> 00:23:40,940
See what kind of genetic diseases
they have.

502
00:23:41,050 --> 00:23:42,519
There's definitely none in my family.

503
00:23:42,999 --> 00:23:43,880
We count backwards.

504
00:23:43,880 --> 00:23:45,350
Even if you go back two hundred years,

505
00:23:45,759 --> 00:23:47,160
everyone was perfectly healthy.

506
00:23:47,160 --> 00:23:47,680
Wait.

507
00:23:47,680 --> 00:23:50,239
Why are you dragging this
onto Zhixia again? What's wrong with her?

508
00:23:50,640 --> 00:23:52,400
Don't take this lightly.

509
00:23:52,960 --> 00:23:54,759
If one day, suddenly,

510
00:23:54,759 --> 00:23:55,880
if Jiao has something wrong,

511
00:23:55,880 --> 00:23:56,799
then you'll understand.

512
00:23:58,759 --> 00:24:00,039
Okay fine, I'll stop talking.

513
00:24:00,960 --> 00:24:02,479
If it's not a gene issue,

514
00:24:02,680 --> 00:24:04,400
then is it an environmental issue?

515
00:24:05,519 --> 00:24:07,039
Whatever Zhixia eats or drinks,

516
00:24:07,039 --> 00:24:08,600
shouldn't you investigate thoroughly?

517
00:24:09,920 --> 00:24:11,719
Always craving junk food,

518
00:24:11,719 --> 00:24:13,440
how could nothing go wrong?

519
00:24:14,719 --> 00:24:16,960
Mom, I realized you're really

520
00:24:17,279 --> 00:24:18,479
quite unreasonable.

521
00:24:23,160 --> 00:24:23,759
Hello?

522
00:24:26,039 --> 00:24:26,719
Mr. Wu.

523
00:24:27,120 --> 00:24:27,840
What is it?

524
00:24:30,160 --> 00:24:31,079
Okay.

525
00:24:31,279 --> 00:24:32,400
I'll be right there. Okay.

526
00:24:32,400 --> 00:24:33,400
I'm heading out first,
something happened at work.

527
00:24:33,400 --> 00:24:34,920
Zhang Hao, I haven't finished talking.

528
00:24:34,960 --> 00:24:36,200
Okay, I know.

529
00:24:36,200 --> 00:24:37,840
I haven't finished talking!

530
00:24:38,279 --> 00:24:40,039
Dianlan Group's CTO recruitment

531
00:24:40,039 --> 00:24:41,960
actually capped the age at thirty-five.

532
00:24:41,960 --> 00:24:44,120
This is blatant age discrimination.

533
00:24:44,120 --> 00:24:46,440
The formal title of this role
is Chief Technology Officer,

534
00:24:46,440 --> 00:24:48,759
they need a technical expert,
who also understands management.

535
00:24:48,759 --> 00:24:51,039
Yet they set the age limit
at thirty-five.

536
00:24:51,039 --> 00:24:52,319
Dianlan Group's HR

537
00:24:52,319 --> 00:24:54,120
must have water in their brains.

538
00:24:54,279 --> 00:24:55,750
Something like this happens right now.

539
00:24:55,760 --> 00:24:57,110
How do you expect me to handle it?

540
00:24:57,960 --> 00:24:58,759
This matter...

541
00:25:00,960 --> 00:25:01,680
Zhang Hao.

542
00:25:01,999 --> 00:25:03,039
Why are you only here now?

543
00:25:03,479 --> 00:25:04,319
Come.

544
00:25:09,519 --> 00:25:12,079
I just went home for lunch.

545
00:25:12,079 --> 00:25:12,960
Look at the time now,

546
00:25:12,960 --> 00:25:14,360
and you still dared go home to eat?

547
00:25:15,799 --> 00:25:16,600
Here, look.

548
00:25:17,239 --> 00:25:18,719
Look.

549
00:25:20,039 --> 00:25:21,479
Because of your oversight,

550
00:25:21,719 --> 00:25:23,840
the company suffered
such a huge negative impact.

551
00:25:24,340 --> 00:25:26,160
Aren't you being too irresponsible,
Zhang Hao?

552
00:25:30,360 --> 00:25:31,039
Mr. Wu.

553
00:25:31,960 --> 00:25:35,160
If you say that, isn't it too one-sided?

554
00:25:35,600 --> 00:25:36,239
Zhang Hao.

555
00:25:36,719 --> 00:25:38,719
You're a senior colleague, experienced.

556
00:25:38,840 --> 00:25:41,239
That's why I left this task to you.

557
00:25:41,960 --> 00:25:43,479
And this is what you gave me?

558
00:25:44,759 --> 00:25:45,999
What did I give you?

559
00:25:48,479 --> 00:25:49,640
Even if I did mess up,

560
00:25:49,640 --> 00:25:50,680
you're the manager.

561
00:25:51,640 --> 00:25:52,640
Shouldn't you review it?

562
00:25:58,880 --> 00:26:00,360
Zhang Hao, what do you mean?

563
00:26:00,840 --> 00:26:02,440
Come on, the leader's here today.

564
00:26:02,960 --> 00:26:05,330
If you have opinions about me,
say it directly to the leader.

565
00:26:06,400 --> 00:26:08,120
Since the leader is here.

566
00:26:09,120 --> 00:26:10,519
Then I'm not taking the blame.

567
00:26:11,360 --> 00:26:12,999
Yes, I do have some opinions about you.

568
00:26:13,400 --> 00:26:14,120
Zhang Hao.

569
00:26:14,920 --> 00:26:17,160
Personal issues can wait.

570
00:26:17,239 --> 00:26:17,880
Mr. Li.

571
00:26:18,400 --> 00:26:19,880
This isn't a personal issue.

572
00:26:19,999 --> 00:26:21,239
I've advised before,

573
00:26:21,239 --> 00:26:22,519
should we extend the age limit

574
00:26:22,519 --> 00:26:23,759
to forty years old?

575
00:26:24,319 --> 00:26:24,920
But,

576
00:26:25,440 --> 00:26:27,120
Mr. Wu disagreed.

577
00:26:27,360 --> 00:26:28,999
He's making things up.

578
00:26:29,479 --> 00:26:30,039
Zhang Hao.

579
00:26:30,039 --> 00:26:31,920
Don't stir things up
in front of the leader.

580
00:26:32,120 --> 00:26:33,279
What did I disagree with?

581
00:26:33,360 --> 00:26:34,479
Do you have proof?

582
00:26:34,640 --> 00:26:36,079
I myself am the proof.

583
00:26:36,880 --> 00:26:38,440
I'm almost forty.

584
00:26:39,039 --> 00:26:39,799
As someone in HR,

585
00:26:39,799 --> 00:26:41,079
why would I limit myself?

586
00:26:42,039 --> 00:26:42,600
Leader.

587
00:26:42,600 --> 00:26:43,640
Alright.

588
00:26:44,440 --> 00:26:45,559
Stop arguing, both of you.

589
00:26:46,120 --> 00:26:47,960
I'm not here to pursue responsibility.

590
00:26:48,680 --> 00:26:49,719
I'm asking you two,

591
00:26:50,279 --> 00:26:51,479
who can, as fast as possible,

592
00:26:51,880 --> 00:26:53,440
resolve this negative publicity for me?

593
00:26:53,460 --> 00:26:54,550
Which one of you will do it?

594
00:27:01,400 --> 00:27:02,400
How about I do it?

595
00:27:03,360 --> 00:27:04,279
How will you handle it?

596
00:27:05,079 --> 00:27:05,840
Apologize.

597
00:27:07,039 --> 00:27:08,039
I'm pretty good at that.

598
00:27:10,960 --> 00:27:11,950
How about you do it then?

599
00:27:17,039 --> 00:27:17,840
Hello everyone,

600
00:27:18,719 --> 00:27:19,920
I am from Dianlan Group,

601
00:27:19,920 --> 00:27:21,680
Zhang Hao, Director of Human Resources.

602
00:27:21,680 --> 00:27:22,999
(Dianlan Group Nanzhou
online press conference)

603
00:27:22,999 --> 00:27:24,479
On behalf of Dianlan Group,

604
00:27:25,400 --> 00:27:28,120
I sincerely apologize
for the inappropriate age requirement.

605
00:27:29,559 --> 00:27:31,160
We are deeply sorry.

606
00:27:32,120 --> 00:27:32,680
Sorry.

607
00:27:48,200 --> 00:27:49,479
I'm already forty years old.

608
00:27:50,880 --> 00:27:52,160
Middle-aged, you know.

609
00:27:53,279 --> 00:27:55,680
I believe, like many of my friends,

610
00:27:55,680 --> 00:27:57,200
we live similar lives.

611
00:27:57,880 --> 00:27:59,200
Sometimes I feel like

612
00:27:59,840 --> 00:28:02,600
a race car whose brakes have failed,

613
00:28:02,840 --> 00:28:04,160
racing on the track.

614
00:28:04,799 --> 00:28:06,120
This car is packed with

615
00:28:06,120 --> 00:28:07,479
all the roles I play,

616
00:28:07,479 --> 00:28:09,479
parent, child,

617
00:28:09,759 --> 00:28:12,120
partner, sibling,

618
00:28:12,120 --> 00:28:13,239
close friends and relatives.

619
00:28:13,279 --> 00:28:15,319
It's an overloaded car,

620
00:28:15,319 --> 00:28:16,400
always wary of

621
00:28:16,400 --> 00:28:17,999
those young vehicles roaring past,

622
00:28:17,999 --> 00:28:19,200
fearing they'll

623
00:28:19,239 --> 00:28:20,479
overtake us,

624
00:28:20,479 --> 00:28:21,880
fear they'll replace us.

625
00:28:25,680 --> 00:28:27,200
But I think precisely because of that,

626
00:28:29,239 --> 00:28:30,400
we can bear the pressure.

627
00:28:31,600 --> 00:28:32,840
We drive more cautiously.

628
00:28:33,759 --> 00:28:35,039
We've climbed more mountains,

629
00:28:35,039 --> 00:28:36,559
we've crossed more waters.

630
00:28:37,559 --> 00:28:39,960
Among us are many capable people.

631
00:28:41,239 --> 00:28:43,279
Ability itself has no upper limit.

632
00:28:44,200 --> 00:28:45,799
If ability has no ceiling,

633
00:28:45,799 --> 00:28:48,200
then why should age have one?

634
00:28:49,999 --> 00:28:50,719
Stand still.

635
00:28:51,039 --> 00:28:51,999
One, two.

636
00:28:52,319 --> 00:28:53,559
Goodbye.

637
00:28:53,680 --> 00:28:56,079
- Thank you, teacher.
- Thank you, teacher.

638
00:28:56,079 --> 00:28:59,680
- Thank you for your hard work, teacher.
- Thank you for your hard work, teacher.

639
00:28:59,680 --> 00:29:00,279
Alright.

640
00:29:01,160 --> 00:29:01,799
Jiao.

641
00:29:01,799 --> 00:29:02,880
Come, go to Daddy.

642
00:29:03,960 --> 00:29:04,640
Mom.

643
00:29:05,400 --> 00:29:06,600
Quick. Look at your Dad.

644
00:29:07,440 --> 00:29:08,120
He's here.

645
00:29:08,680 --> 00:29:10,319
On behalf of Dianlan Group,

646
00:29:10,559 --> 00:29:12,039
I solemnly promise to everyone

647
00:29:12,200 --> 00:29:13,559
that for the CTO position,

648
00:29:13,559 --> 00:29:15,319
we will not set an upper age limit.

649
00:29:16,120 --> 00:29:16,960
Dianlan Group

650
00:29:17,239 --> 00:29:18,960
warmly welcomes all capable

651
00:29:18,960 --> 00:29:20,400
and talented people to join us.

652
00:29:21,279 --> 00:29:21,999
And I,

653
00:29:23,880 --> 00:29:24,880
this old car

654
00:29:26,400 --> 00:29:28,279
is always awaiting you at Dianlan Group.

655
00:29:29,460 --> 00:29:30,650
We look forward to seeing you.

656
00:29:32,840 --> 00:29:33,519
Thank you.

657
00:29:44,519 --> 00:29:46,120
My Dad is so handsome.

658
00:29:46,360 --> 00:29:48,120
What's your sense of aesthetics?

659
00:29:48,640 --> 00:29:49,880
Look how chubby he is.

660
00:29:52,079 --> 00:29:53,039
Auntie, I'm in.

661
00:29:53,479 --> 00:29:54,120
Come in.

662
00:29:55,279 --> 00:29:56,079
How is it?

663
00:30:01,519 --> 00:30:02,200
How is it?

664
00:30:04,160 --> 00:30:05,600
Take it slow, no rush.

665
00:30:08,759 --> 00:30:11,200
Meeting at Hays Bar at seven tonight.

666
00:30:22,920 --> 00:30:23,759
What time is it now?

667
00:30:23,759 --> 00:30:25,170
Why haven't they arrived? Check it out.

668
00:30:25,180 --> 00:30:26,220
I'll send a WeChat to ask.

669
00:30:28,880 --> 00:30:29,640
Selam.

670
00:30:30,039 --> 00:30:30,519
Selam.

671
00:30:30,559 --> 00:30:31,160
Selam.

672
00:30:31,560 --> 00:30:32,759
Why are you just arriving now?

673
00:30:32,999 --> 00:30:34,319
Was someone called Simon?

674
00:30:34,400 --> 00:30:36,519
I think I heard that name.

675
00:30:36,840 --> 00:30:37,319
Let's go.

676
00:30:39,039 --> 00:30:39,759
Come on.

677
00:30:40,640 --> 00:30:41,719
Come on, take one.

678
00:30:44,200 --> 00:30:44,880
Buddy.

679
00:30:45,600 --> 00:30:46,920
Are you Simon?

680
00:30:47,120 --> 00:30:48,239
Yeah, it's me.

681
00:30:48,400 --> 00:30:49,279
Who are you?

682
00:30:50,120 --> 00:30:51,799
I'm Feng Meiqi's Mother.

683
00:30:51,880 --> 00:30:52,759
Feng Meiqi?

684
00:30:53,200 --> 00:30:54,079
I don't know her.

685
00:30:54,279 --> 00:30:55,840
Feng Meiqi is my daughter.

686
00:30:56,170 --> 00:30:57,719
Auntie, are you mistaking me
for someone else?

687
00:30:57,719 --> 00:30:58,960
I don't know Feng Meiqi.

688
00:30:58,960 --> 00:31:00,319
Stop pretending.

689
00:31:00,840 --> 00:31:02,519
Feng Meiqi is pregnant.

690
00:31:02,719 --> 00:31:03,479
You slept with her.

691
00:31:03,479 --> 00:31:03,999
What were you doing?

692
00:31:03,999 --> 00:31:05,319
You have to take responsibility.

693
00:31:05,760 --> 00:31:06,519
What are you doing?

694
00:31:06,519 --> 00:31:07,640
Are you even human?

695
00:31:07,640 --> 00:31:08,580
Dude, are you crazy?

696
00:31:08,580 --> 00:31:10,200
I don't know what nonsense
you're talking about.

697
00:31:10,200 --> 00:31:11,479
I don't know who you're talking about.

698
00:31:11,479 --> 00:31:12,910
Are you picking a fight? Sorry, man.

699
00:31:12,920 --> 00:31:13,840
Looking for trouble, huh?

700
00:31:13,840 --> 00:31:15,039
You've got the wrong person.

701
00:31:15,039 --> 00:31:15,719
They are looking for me.

702
00:31:15,719 --> 00:31:17,039
- No, who are you?
- No, who are you?

703
00:31:17,719 --> 00:31:19,440
I'm the Lawyer Yao you're looking for.

704
00:31:19,759 --> 00:31:20,600
Simon Yao.

705
00:31:21,160 --> 00:31:22,160
That should be me.

706
00:31:23,840 --> 00:31:24,920
Simon Yao?

707
00:31:25,039 --> 00:31:25,960
Are you sure?

708
00:31:25,960 --> 00:31:26,640
Yes.

709
00:31:26,799 --> 00:31:28,360
I'm Feng Meiqi's Mother.

710
00:31:28,360 --> 00:31:29,200
Hello, Auntie.

711
00:31:29,440 --> 00:31:30,600
What hello?

712
00:31:31,279 --> 00:31:32,479
Are you looking for trouble?

713
00:31:33,200 --> 00:31:34,680
Explain yourself.

714
00:31:35,160 --> 00:31:36,799
Auntie, let me explain, okay?

715
00:31:36,799 --> 00:31:37,640
I love Meiqi.

716
00:31:37,640 --> 00:31:38,799
I want to be with her.

717
00:31:38,799 --> 00:31:40,160
I'm willing to take responsibility.

718
00:31:40,160 --> 00:31:41,360
Take responsibility for what?

719
00:31:41,370 --> 00:31:42,600
You messed with Meiqi and then

720
00:31:42,600 --> 00:31:43,360
you ran away.

721
00:31:43,360 --> 00:31:44,200
You disappeared.

722
00:31:44,200 --> 00:31:45,200
Yeah, you didn't reply.

723
00:31:45,200 --> 00:31:45,999
Where are you?

724
00:31:46,079 --> 00:31:47,120
Where have you been?

725
00:31:47,239 --> 00:31:48,479
Meiqi deleted me on WeChat.

726
00:31:48,479 --> 00:31:49,400
I can't reach her.

727
00:31:49,840 --> 00:31:50,840
She deleted you.

728
00:31:50,840 --> 00:31:52,279
No way. Stop fooling around.

729
00:31:52,279 --> 00:31:53,239
It's true.

730
00:31:55,759 --> 00:31:57,479
Back when I studied in the UK,

731
00:31:58,120 --> 00:31:59,680
I always liked Meiqi.

732
00:32:00,360 --> 00:32:01,719
I even expressed my feelings.

733
00:32:02,239 --> 00:32:03,559
But she rejected me.

734
00:32:04,999 --> 00:32:06,680
After returning to China, we met again.

735
00:32:07,719 --> 00:32:09,519
Every time I saw her,

736
00:32:10,799 --> 00:32:12,680
Meiqi looked troubled.

737
00:32:12,920 --> 00:32:14,840
So I comforted her,

738
00:32:15,039 --> 00:32:15,799
consoled her.

739
00:32:16,960 --> 00:32:18,960
Later we became a couple.

740
00:32:19,319 --> 00:32:21,079
It was indeed Meiqi who deleted me.

741
00:32:22,999 --> 00:32:24,799
No, from what you just said,

742
00:32:24,799 --> 00:32:27,039
you and Meiqi actually had
a good relationship.

743
00:32:28,120 --> 00:32:29,759
Then why did she delete you?

744
00:32:31,120 --> 00:32:32,079
Did you do something?

745
00:32:32,079 --> 00:32:33,079
Something wrong to her?

746
00:32:33,079 --> 00:32:33,999
No, Auntie.

747
00:32:34,279 --> 00:32:35,360
I want to know too.

748
00:32:35,640 --> 00:32:36,960
I even invited Meiqi to my home,

749
00:32:36,960 --> 00:32:38,360
and had dinner with my parents.

750
00:32:38,360 --> 00:32:39,319
At home?

751
00:32:40,200 --> 00:32:40,799
Meiqi

752
00:32:41,200 --> 00:32:42,920
even had dinner with my parents?

753
00:32:42,920 --> 00:32:43,519
Auntie.

754
00:32:43,680 --> 00:32:44,880
I genuinely want to take things

755
00:32:44,880 --> 00:32:46,120
further with Meiqi.

756
00:32:47,279 --> 00:32:48,319
But after that,

757
00:32:48,319 --> 00:32:50,200
Meiqi disappeared.

758
00:32:50,200 --> 00:32:51,079
She deleted me.

759
00:32:59,719 --> 00:33:00,360
Alright.

760
00:33:01,200 --> 00:33:02,160
I understand, Mom.

761
00:33:05,479 --> 00:33:06,120
Auntie.

762
00:33:06,559 --> 00:33:07,479
My Mom called.

763
00:33:08,360 --> 00:33:09,479
She's at the door.

764
00:33:09,479 --> 00:33:11,680
She wants to talk to you
about Meiqi and me.

765
00:33:12,400 --> 00:33:14,160
Alright, let's talk.

766
00:33:18,400 --> 00:33:19,920
Mom, you talk properly.

767
00:33:19,920 --> 00:33:21,640
Don't rush, just stay there.

768
00:33:28,519 --> 00:33:29,319
Hello.

769
00:33:29,759 --> 00:33:30,400
Hello.

770
00:33:30,559 --> 00:33:32,079
Mom, this is Meiqi's mom.

771
00:33:32,360 --> 00:33:33,319
Auntie, this is my mom.

772
00:33:34,440 --> 00:33:35,039
Please sit.

773
00:33:35,039 --> 00:33:35,880
Alright, sit.

774
00:33:39,560 --> 00:33:40,920
Would you like something to drink?

775
00:33:42,079 --> 00:33:42,799
Coffee.

776
00:33:42,999 --> 00:33:44,090
Yes, a cup of coffee please.

777
00:33:44,479 --> 00:33:45,600
Okay, please wait.

778
00:33:54,120 --> 00:33:56,920
Simon told me the situation.

779
00:33:57,640 --> 00:34:01,120
What cooperation do we need to provide?

780
00:34:01,400 --> 00:34:02,880
You must take responsibility.

781
00:34:04,319 --> 00:34:04,999
Of course.

782
00:34:07,160 --> 00:34:09,960
But does the child need to be born...

783
00:34:11,119 --> 00:34:11,800
Jianqi.

784
00:34:11,800 --> 00:34:12,999
Let's go home with Mom.

785
00:34:12,999 --> 00:34:13,800
Abort the child.

786
00:34:13,800 --> 00:34:14,159
Divorce.

787
00:34:15,760 --> 00:34:16,999
What do you mean by that?

788
00:34:19,479 --> 00:34:20,400
Meiqi's mom.

789
00:34:20,720 --> 00:34:22,320
I haven't finished speaking.

790
00:34:22,639 --> 00:34:24,320
Why do you have to get so worked up?

791
00:34:25,039 --> 00:34:26,999
Whether the two kids get married,

792
00:34:26,999 --> 00:34:28,360
or have children,

793
00:34:28,440 --> 00:34:30,320
that's up to them to decide.

794
00:34:32,639 --> 00:34:33,760
After marriage,

795
00:34:34,360 --> 00:34:35,880
will they live in Nanzhou

796
00:34:36,280 --> 00:34:37,360
or Shanghai?

797
00:34:39,400 --> 00:34:40,360
We've never

798
00:34:40,760 --> 00:34:42,800
been to Nanzhou before.

799
00:34:44,320 --> 00:34:45,760
We have a few properties

800
00:34:45,880 --> 00:34:47,519
in Shanghai.

801
00:34:48,199 --> 00:34:49,440
One's a villa,

802
00:34:49,599 --> 00:34:50,880
quite spacious.

803
00:34:51,240 --> 00:34:54,199
But it's a bit far from

804
00:34:54,199 --> 00:34:55,119
where Simon works.

805
00:34:55,440 --> 00:34:58,479
But these are things we
can discuss later.

806
00:35:00,639 --> 00:35:01,559
Speak frankly.

807
00:35:06,559 --> 00:35:07,280
Of course.

808
00:35:08,519 --> 00:35:10,079
It's our responsibility.

809
00:35:11,079 --> 00:35:12,280
We can't run from it.

810
00:35:13,320 --> 00:35:15,159
But I also hope you

811
00:35:15,639 --> 00:35:18,079
can give us some peace of mind.

812
00:35:19,320 --> 00:35:20,479
Before the transfer,

813
00:35:20,479 --> 00:35:22,800
should we do a paternity test first?

814
00:35:23,199 --> 00:35:25,119
Young people these days are so careless.

815
00:35:25,240 --> 00:35:26,999
What if it's not Jianqi's, right?

816
00:35:32,360 --> 00:35:34,440
In a family like ours,

817
00:35:34,679 --> 00:35:36,079
we've never had a case

818
00:35:36,240 --> 00:35:39,119
of "boarding first, paying later."

819
00:35:40,320 --> 00:35:42,800
If the ticket is wrong,

820
00:35:42,880 --> 00:35:44,920
and the two families clash,

821
00:35:45,360 --> 00:35:47,880
it'll be very embarrassing.

822
00:35:48,360 --> 00:35:49,639
So I...

823
00:35:51,639 --> 00:35:52,280
So,

824
00:35:53,400 --> 00:35:55,119
whether Meiqi has the child

825
00:35:55,320 --> 00:35:56,559
is her decision.

826
00:35:57,760 --> 00:35:58,960
We're not here

827
00:35:58,960 --> 00:36:01,079
to find a dispensable Father.

828
00:36:02,039 --> 00:36:03,119
What if there's no Father?

829
00:36:04,119 --> 00:36:05,629
It's not like the Mother is dead.

830
00:36:06,119 --> 00:36:07,519
We can raise our own child,

831
00:36:07,519 --> 00:36:08,519
ourselves.

832
00:36:15,639 --> 00:36:16,800
Slow down while eating.

833
00:36:19,760 --> 00:36:21,840
You guys haven't eaten well
these past few days.

834
00:36:22,519 --> 00:36:24,159
Minghui kept it from us.

835
00:36:24,999 --> 00:36:27,599
Finally, you brought her back safely.

836
00:36:28,400 --> 00:36:29,400
You don't know,

837
00:36:29,559 --> 00:36:30,519
Mrs. Feng...

838
00:36:31,320 --> 00:36:32,479
Mrs. Feng is amazing.

839
00:36:32,520 --> 00:36:33,880
You wouldn't believe her momentum.

840
00:36:33,880 --> 00:36:35,119
Very impressive.

841
00:36:35,519 --> 00:36:36,199
She saw someone,

842
00:36:36,199 --> 00:36:37,039
and just

843
00:36:37,280 --> 00:36:38,559
splashed coffee in their face.

844
00:36:39,639 --> 00:36:41,599
I was too angry,

845
00:36:41,599 --> 00:36:42,280
you know?

846
00:36:42,280 --> 00:36:43,720
Simon's mom said that,

847
00:36:43,720 --> 00:36:45,320
I almost lost control.

848
00:36:45,320 --> 00:36:46,679
I just splashed it.

849
00:36:47,320 --> 00:36:48,039
Impulsive.

850
00:36:48,039 --> 00:36:48,920
Deserved it.

851
00:36:50,360 --> 00:36:51,199
Well done.

852
00:36:52,119 --> 00:36:52,840
Mr. and Mrs. Shen.

853
00:36:53,920 --> 00:36:54,920
Hui

854
00:36:55,639 --> 00:36:56,240
is impressive.

855
00:36:56,519 --> 00:36:58,039
This kid takes responsibility.

856
00:36:58,039 --> 00:36:59,880
He'll have a bright future.

857
00:37:01,240 --> 00:37:02,199
Thanks, bro.

858
00:37:03,119 --> 00:37:04,320
What are you saying, Mrs. Feng?

859
00:37:04,760 --> 00:37:05,880
It's nothing.

860
00:37:08,920 --> 00:37:09,639
Mr. and Mrs. Shen.

861
00:37:10,159 --> 00:37:11,079
Thank you.

862
00:37:11,679 --> 00:37:13,599
During our toughest times,

863
00:37:14,880 --> 00:37:16,199
you never left us.

864
00:37:16,679 --> 00:37:18,760
Always supporting and helping us.

865
00:37:19,559 --> 00:37:21,240
Family shouldn't say these things.

866
00:37:21,240 --> 00:37:21,920
Don't worry.

867
00:37:22,639 --> 00:37:24,400
We'll end this kind of

868
00:37:24,400 --> 00:37:25,760
relying on others' home life soon.

869
00:37:26,639 --> 00:37:27,920
We'll move out quickly.

870
00:37:28,360 --> 00:37:29,920
Once our factory is up,

871
00:37:30,079 --> 00:37:31,920
we'll buy back our house soon.

872
00:37:32,840 --> 00:37:33,519
Don't worry.

873
00:37:34,519 --> 00:37:35,079
Mom,

874
00:37:35,079 --> 00:37:36,920
eat while it's hot,
don't let it get cold.

875
00:37:37,119 --> 00:37:38,679
No, the noodles are too hard.

876
00:37:38,679 --> 00:37:39,400
I'll soak them.

877
00:37:39,400 --> 00:37:40,450
I'll have some soup first.

878
00:37:40,599 --> 00:37:42,039
Then I'll make you another bowl.

879
00:37:42,039 --> 00:37:43,039
No.

880
00:37:43,039 --> 00:37:44,079
Sit down, don't bother.

881
00:37:47,360 --> 00:37:48,360
I'll get some vinegar.

882
00:37:56,199 --> 00:37:56,840
Mom,

883
00:37:57,880 --> 00:37:59,920
what did you mean by what you just said?

884
00:38:01,400 --> 00:38:02,880
I meant nothing.

885
00:38:05,079 --> 00:38:07,119
I support you having the child.

886
00:38:09,639 --> 00:38:11,840
A single mother can still raise a child

887
00:38:11,840 --> 00:38:13,400
healthy and happy.

888
00:38:14,039 --> 00:38:15,039
I know.

889
00:38:16,159 --> 00:38:18,039
But you shouldn't have just said

890
00:38:18,530 --> 00:38:19,840
living under someone else's roof.

891
00:38:20,400 --> 00:38:22,280
Must be uncomfortable
after they heard it.

892
00:38:22,400 --> 00:38:24,280
Without money,
you can't hold your head high.

893
00:38:26,400 --> 00:38:27,400
Right now,

894
00:38:27,400 --> 00:38:29,320
we've just come here
to stay temporarily.

895
00:38:29,720 --> 00:38:30,679
If it drags on,

896
00:38:30,840 --> 00:38:32,519
they'll definitely feel uncomfortable,

897
00:38:32,519 --> 00:38:33,400
and unhappy.

898
00:38:35,679 --> 00:38:36,320
Meiqi,

899
00:38:37,720 --> 00:38:39,280
this time when I went to Shanghai,

900
00:38:40,400 --> 00:38:42,013
I met the first partner

901
00:38:42,037 --> 00:38:45,280
from when your dad
and I started our business.

902
00:38:46,800 --> 00:38:48,920
They've already agreed to help us

903
00:38:49,559 --> 00:38:51,559
rebuild the factory.

904
00:38:53,119 --> 00:38:53,920
Why?

905
00:38:54,660 --> 00:38:56,440
Starting a factory
isn't just about talking.

906
00:38:56,440 --> 00:38:57,519
Why would they help us?

907
00:38:57,519 --> 00:38:59,639
Because of you, because of me,

908
00:39:00,320 --> 00:39:02,400
and the inheritance your dad left.

909
00:39:02,599 --> 00:39:05,920
But we've already handled everything
that needed handling.

910
00:39:07,320 --> 00:39:08,039
Meiqi,

911
00:39:08,350 --> 00:39:09,400
before I went to Shanghai,

912
00:39:09,400 --> 00:39:11,840
I had Minghui accompany me
to Jianmei Workshop.

913
00:39:11,840 --> 00:39:12,720
Sure enough,

914
00:39:13,159 --> 00:39:15,039
Feng had left stock there.

915
00:39:15,519 --> 00:39:16,760
Mulberry silk.

916
00:39:17,360 --> 00:39:18,280
Look at this.

917
00:39:40,079 --> 00:39:40,720
Mom,

918
00:39:42,240 --> 00:39:44,039
Dad really cared about us.

919
00:39:47,320 --> 00:39:48,119
Meiqi,

920
00:39:48,920 --> 00:39:50,400
with this stock,

921
00:39:51,679 --> 00:39:53,559
we can make a comeback.

922
00:39:57,760 --> 00:39:59,400
But starting a factory is so hard.

923
00:40:00,280 --> 00:40:01,760
How could we do it alone?

924
00:40:01,999 --> 00:40:03,639
Don't underestimate me.

925
00:40:05,119 --> 00:40:06,280
You think I've always been

926
00:40:06,280 --> 00:40:08,280
a pampered idle person?

927
00:40:08,840 --> 00:40:09,920
Not at all.

928
00:40:10,720 --> 00:40:12,599
I followed your dad,

929
00:40:12,599 --> 00:40:15,400
starting from scratch with him.

930
00:40:15,840 --> 00:40:17,400
Back then, we had no money.

931
00:40:17,400 --> 00:40:18,240
You know what?

932
00:40:18,240 --> 00:40:20,280
We put the goods on the back
of bicycles,

933
00:40:20,280 --> 00:40:21,559
and delivered them by bike.

934
00:40:21,880 --> 00:40:23,999
The stacks were taller than me.

935
00:40:23,999 --> 00:40:25,960
As soon as I got on, the bike tipped.

936
00:40:25,960 --> 00:40:27,679
I had to lie over the handlebars

937
00:40:28,400 --> 00:40:29,880
to ride and deliver.

938
00:40:30,280 --> 00:40:32,039
Later, when we had a little money,

939
00:40:32,280 --> 00:40:34,320
we started hiring trucks.

940
00:40:34,599 --> 00:40:36,360
Each of us guarded a truck,

941
00:40:36,360 --> 00:40:38,400
afraid the goods would be swapped.

942
00:40:38,400 --> 00:40:40,320
We entertained clients

943
00:40:40,320 --> 00:40:42,159
to secure orders.

944
00:40:42,400 --> 00:40:44,519
Dad drank till he was sick, I took over.

945
00:40:45,079 --> 00:40:48,920
That's how our business was built,
order by order.

946
00:40:49,159 --> 00:40:50,559
I didn't know that.

947
00:40:52,559 --> 00:40:54,199
There are many things you don't know.

948
00:40:54,199 --> 00:40:55,199
When we have time later,

949
00:40:55,199 --> 00:40:56,920
I'll tell you slowly.

950
00:41:00,079 --> 00:41:00,800
Meiqi,

951
00:41:03,800 --> 00:41:05,639
are you willing to take another shot

952
00:41:05,880 --> 00:41:07,599
with me?

953
00:41:12,119 --> 00:41:14,039
Yes, of course I am, Mom.

954
00:41:15,079 --> 00:41:16,320
But the problem now is,

955
00:41:17,280 --> 00:41:19,559
the restaurant is finally on track.

956
00:41:19,960 --> 00:41:22,400
Mingzhu and I are fully committed,
so there's no energy left.

957
00:41:22,400 --> 00:41:22,920
No.

958
00:41:22,920 --> 00:41:24,519
Meiqi, I've thought it through.

959
00:41:24,880 --> 00:41:27,159
You studied abroad
and have seen the world.

960
00:41:27,280 --> 00:41:28,159
Since you were little,

961
00:41:28,159 --> 00:41:29,800
you've been in the factory with your dad.

962
00:41:29,800 --> 00:41:31,400
You know the fabrics inside out.

963
00:41:31,400 --> 00:41:33,240
You understand everything.

964
00:41:34,039 --> 00:41:36,079
Running a restaurant is just
a temporary measure.

965
00:41:36,079 --> 00:41:37,519
Now the opportunity has come.

966
00:41:37,840 --> 00:41:38,760
Let me tell you,

967
00:41:39,240 --> 00:41:41,559
the factory's yearly profit
can't be matched

968
00:41:41,559 --> 00:41:43,840
by that restaurant even in ten years.

969
00:41:46,760 --> 00:41:47,400
Meiqi.

970
00:41:48,599 --> 00:41:51,240
Do you want to stay cooped up
in that little restaurant for life?

971
00:41:52,720 --> 00:41:54,400
Don't you want to fly higher,

972
00:41:54,400 --> 00:41:55,519
and go further?

973
00:41:56,760 --> 00:41:58,039
Now you have a child,

974
00:41:58,039 --> 00:41:59,760
and you've decided to have him.

975
00:42:01,119 --> 00:42:03,920
You have a responsibility
to give him the best conditions.

976
00:42:04,199 --> 00:42:06,039
I understand the logic, but

977
00:42:07,519 --> 00:42:09,800
you're asking me now
to leave Mingzhu alone there.

978
00:42:10,999 --> 00:42:13,599
Wouldn't all our efforts be wasted?

979
00:42:13,880 --> 00:42:15,880
Then where does Mingzhu stand?

980
00:42:16,039 --> 00:42:17,920
Their whole family is helping us,

981
00:42:17,920 --> 00:42:19,400
and you want to push her aside now?

982
00:42:19,410 --> 00:42:20,199
What does that mean?

983
00:42:20,199 --> 00:42:21,920
Who says we're leaving her?

984
00:42:22,479 --> 00:42:24,360
Mingzhu will come with us.

985
00:42:24,639 --> 00:42:25,400
Meiqi,

986
00:42:25,639 --> 00:42:27,199
the Feng family's women

987
00:42:27,199 --> 00:42:28,720
will definitely make it work.

988
00:42:28,720 --> 00:42:30,159
It's not like that, Mom.

989
00:42:30,159 --> 00:42:30,920
Then how is it?

990
00:42:30,920 --> 00:42:33,150
You said don't let her do it,
so you don't let her do it.

991
00:42:33,199 --> 00:42:35,320
She sold her only house.

992
00:42:35,320 --> 00:42:36,559
Once the factory starts,

993
00:42:36,559 --> 00:42:38,599
she can buy it back quickly.

994
00:42:39,400 --> 00:42:40,119
Really.

995
00:42:40,960 --> 00:42:42,360
Trust me, Meiqi.
