00:01:12,431 --> 00:01:14,800
(Adapted from iceread.com novel
"You Xi" by Qingyang Wanxi)

00:01:14,980 --> 00:01:17,980
=Episode 21=

4
00:01:24,820 --> 00:01:25,580
Shen.

5
00:01:26,140 --> 00:01:27,100
I have been thinking.

6
00:01:27,100 --> 00:01:28,000
Mr. Hu

7
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:29,770
takes time every noon to tutor Minghui.

8
00:01:30,110 --> 00:01:32,700
Should we show our appreciation?

9
00:01:32,880 --> 00:01:34,690
- Right.
- I already brought him chops, Mom.

10
00:01:34,700 --> 00:01:35,820
Chops hardly count.

11
00:01:36,040 --> 00:01:36,660
That is nothing.

12
00:01:36,660 --> 00:01:38,250
- I am back.
- We still need to thank him properly.

13
00:01:39,660 --> 00:01:40,860
Mingzhu, I will dish your rice.

14
00:01:40,860 --> 00:01:41,460
Alright.

15
00:01:41,660 --> 00:01:42,450
You must be hungry.

16
00:01:44,920 --> 00:01:45,700
Come on, eat first.

17
00:01:50,580 --> 00:01:52,380
You finished all the soup and meat.

18
00:01:52,660 --> 00:01:55,900
Yu Jingxiang said thank you.

19
00:01:56,060 --> 00:01:57,950
She does not need to thank me.
I should thank her.

20
00:01:58,220 --> 00:01:59,860
Tell her not to stir things up again.

21
00:02:00,170 --> 00:02:01,540
She nearly made us doubt ourselves.

22
00:02:01,900 --> 00:02:03,050
Your mom is always like this.

23
00:02:03,820 --> 00:02:04,820
She does a good deed.

24
00:02:04,980 --> 00:02:06,620
But she never softens her words.

25
00:02:07,500 --> 00:02:08,550
She is not easy to please.

26
00:02:09,300 --> 00:02:10,550
I know I am not easy to please.

27
00:02:10,960 --> 00:02:12,860
If you want someone pleasant,
find someone else.

28
00:02:13,620 --> 00:02:14,460
Look at you.

29
00:02:16,020 --> 00:02:16,460
Zhixia.

30
00:02:17,060 --> 00:02:17,860
Let me tell you.

31
00:02:18,380 --> 00:02:19,460
Today Hu Gang

32
00:02:19,460 --> 00:02:21,320
went on and on at me.

33
00:02:21,780 --> 00:02:22,860
When I mentioned Feng Meiqi,

34
00:02:23,060 --> 00:02:24,460
he went quiet straight away.

35
00:02:24,660 --> 00:02:25,580
He looked heartbroken.

36
00:02:25,940 --> 00:02:27,500
Do you have any sense?

37
00:02:27,500 --> 00:02:28,840
Why would you bring up Feng Meiqi?

38
00:02:29,060 --> 00:02:30,100
I had no choice.

39
00:02:30,500 --> 00:02:32,140
If I do not break his defense,

40
00:02:32,140 --> 00:02:33,500
he keeps lecturing me.

41
00:02:33,500 --> 00:02:33,980
You...

42
00:02:34,180 --> 00:02:34,900
Honestly, child.

43
00:02:34,900 --> 00:02:35,900
He treats you so well.

44
00:02:36,240 --> 00:02:38,500
Should you not show some gratitude?

45
00:02:38,660 --> 00:02:40,110
You do not know what is good for you.

46
00:02:40,260 --> 00:02:41,900
You have no sense of appreciation.

47
00:02:41,960 --> 00:02:42,930
Do not speak of it again.

48
00:02:45,260 --> 00:02:45,740
Zhu.

49
00:02:46,060 --> 00:02:46,700
At your hotel,

50
00:02:47,300 --> 00:02:50,630
you have those staff meal vouchers.

51
00:02:50,630 --> 00:02:52,140
Or the meal cards, right?

52
00:02:52,580 --> 00:02:54,510
Shall we buy a few for Mr. Hu?

53
00:02:55,900 --> 00:02:57,530
But Hu Gang is single.

54
00:02:57,900 --> 00:02:59,810
Who would he invite with a meal card?

55
00:02:59,960 --> 00:03:01,060
His future father-in-law.

56
00:03:02,660 --> 00:03:03,340
Ni Debao.

57
00:03:03,980 --> 00:03:04,730
Ni Debao?

58
00:03:05,260 --> 00:03:05,860
Ni Debao.

59
00:03:06,340 --> 00:03:07,340
Ni Debao

60
00:03:07,460 --> 00:03:08,740
has already helped Miss Ni

61
00:03:08,860 --> 00:03:10,330
get Mr. Hu's WeChat.

62
00:03:14,380 --> 00:03:16,100
Why is Ni Debao so unreliable?

63
00:03:17,460 --> 00:03:18,840
We definitely cannot buy that card.

64
00:03:18,860 --> 00:03:20,300
He will end up using it on Ni Debao.

65
00:03:20,300 --> 00:03:21,340
And who knows

66
00:03:21,340 --> 00:03:22,740
which woman he will take with it.

67
00:03:23,100 --> 00:03:25,120
Stop spending time with Ni Debao.

68
00:03:25,120 --> 00:03:26,080
You will only pick up the bad parts.

69
00:03:26,140 --> 00:03:26,780
How about

70
00:03:27,540 --> 00:03:29,900
we simply give him a red envelope?

71
00:03:29,900 --> 00:03:30,640
What do you think?

72
00:03:31,620 --> 00:03:32,500
A red envelope works.

73
00:03:32,780 --> 00:03:34,820
Alright, I will go get some cash.

74
00:03:35,820 --> 00:03:36,740
A red envelope then.

75
00:03:37,820 --> 00:03:39,540
Are you thanking Mr. Hu

76
00:03:39,540 --> 00:03:41,100
or dragging him into trouble?

77
00:03:41,380 --> 00:03:42,060
That...

78
00:03:42,060 --> 00:03:43,380
Then how should we thank him?

79
00:03:43,700 --> 00:03:44,340
You

80
00:03:45,860 --> 00:03:47,140
should give him a special gift.

81
00:03:47,980 --> 00:03:49,460
Something useful at home or away.

82
00:03:49,460 --> 00:03:50,650
Something he can use for life.

83
00:03:51,340 --> 00:03:52,340
What kind of gift?

84
00:03:54,980 --> 00:03:55,620
Me.

85
00:04:24,660 --> 00:04:26,030
Mr. Hu Gang, is that you?

86
00:04:28,740 --> 00:04:29,710
Yes, I am.

87
00:04:29,980 --> 00:04:30,580
Hello.

88
00:04:30,820 --> 00:04:32,620
Thank you
for looking after our Shen Minghui.

89
00:04:33,140 --> 00:04:34,260
Enjoy something nice to eat.

90
00:04:35,020 --> 00:04:35,660
Here you go.

91
00:04:38,580 --> 00:04:40,020
Thank you.

92
00:04:40,020 --> 00:04:40,740
See you tomorrow.

93
00:05:08,980 --> 00:05:09,820
How does it feel?

94
00:05:10,620 --> 00:05:11,740
Apart from the clothes,

95
00:05:11,940 --> 00:05:13,820
you do not look anything
like Feng Meiqi.

96
00:05:13,820 --> 00:05:14,580
You know nothing.

97
00:05:18,660 --> 00:05:19,860
Hello, Mr. Hu.

98
00:05:20,500 --> 00:05:21,420
My name is Ni.

99
00:05:22,540 --> 00:05:24,140
That is far too forced.

100
00:05:25,260 --> 00:05:26,130
Mr. Hu

101
00:05:26,130 --> 00:05:28,020
has already been hurt once.

102
00:05:28,180 --> 00:05:29,500
Can you not try a different style?

103
00:05:29,660 --> 00:05:30,540
Let me tell you.

104
00:05:30,780 --> 00:05:32,900
Men always fall into the same trap

105
00:05:33,220 --> 00:05:34,180
again and again.

106
00:05:34,300 --> 00:05:35,390
Just look at my dad.

107
00:05:38,600 --> 00:05:39,460
Mom, come in.

108
00:05:39,980 --> 00:05:40,900
What are you doing?

109
00:05:40,900 --> 00:05:42,180
- Come on.
- Mom is working.

110
00:05:42,300 --> 00:05:42,900
Look.

111
00:05:48,140 --> 00:05:48,900
You are pregnant?

112
00:05:52,540 --> 00:05:53,830
Did I not tell you

113
00:05:53,830 --> 00:05:55,540
that you cannot have a child now?

114
00:05:56,780 --> 00:05:57,860
It just happened.

115
00:05:58,180 --> 00:05:59,730
We are getting married anyway.

116
00:06:02,660 --> 00:06:03,920
Does Xu Zhidong know?

117
00:06:04,260 --> 00:06:05,740
I have not had the chance to tell him.

118
00:06:05,820 --> 00:06:06,940
I will tell him now.

119
00:06:10,820 --> 00:06:11,900
You cannot tell him yet.

120
00:06:13,260 --> 00:06:15,200
We need to visit his mom
at the hospital first.

121
00:06:15,540 --> 00:06:16,700
See what their attitude is.

122
00:06:17,420 --> 00:06:17,980
Why?

123
00:06:17,980 --> 00:06:19,020
Why what?

124
00:06:19,480 --> 00:06:21,460
When you are not pregnant,
you have many options.

125
00:06:21,460 --> 00:06:23,420
When you are pregnant,
you have none. Understand?

126
00:06:24,060 --> 00:06:25,820
If they find out you are pregnant now,

127
00:06:25,820 --> 00:06:27,210
you have to marry Xu Zhidong.

128
00:06:27,210 --> 00:06:28,640
There will be no choice. Understand?

129
00:06:30,860 --> 00:06:32,260
You have no sense at all.

130
00:06:49,900 --> 00:06:50,540
Mom.

131
00:06:53,380 --> 00:06:54,070
Zhidong.

132
00:06:54,140 --> 00:06:55,020
How are you today?

133
00:06:55,500 --> 00:06:56,380
Do you feel better?

134
00:06:57,540 --> 00:06:58,380
Much better.

135
00:06:59,020 --> 00:06:59,660
Good.

136
00:07:00,540 --> 00:07:03,580
Xu went to the reservoir
early this morning caught a fish

137
00:07:03,580 --> 00:07:04,770
and cooked it into soup for you.

138
00:07:04,780 --> 00:07:05,660
Not bad.

139
00:07:06,420 --> 00:07:07,020
Want some?

140
00:07:08,780 --> 00:07:09,340
No.

141
00:07:10,260 --> 00:07:11,320
No.

142
00:07:11,320 --> 00:07:13,420
If your useless dad really cared
about me that much, would I...

143
00:07:13,780 --> 00:07:15,750
Would I have ended up
needing a blood transfusion?

144
00:07:16,100 --> 00:07:16,660
Again.

145
00:07:16,660 --> 00:07:17,340
Auntie.

146
00:07:18,900 --> 00:07:20,020
Chen, Auntie.

147
00:07:20,540 --> 00:07:21,410
Bichen.

148
00:07:22,030 --> 00:07:22,580
Zhidong.

149
00:07:22,580 --> 00:07:22,900
Give it to me.

150
00:07:22,900 --> 00:07:23,900
- Yu.
- Mrs. Yuan.

151
00:07:23,900 --> 00:07:24,620
You are here.

152
00:07:24,830 --> 00:07:26,200
Zhidong.

153
00:07:26,200 --> 00:07:27,330
- Help me sit up.
- How is he now?

154
00:07:27,330 --> 00:07:28,110
Feeling any better?

155
00:07:28,120 --> 00:07:28,740
I feel much better.

156
00:07:28,740 --> 00:07:29,740
No need to sit up.

157
00:07:29,740 --> 00:07:30,980
- Auntie.
- No need to get up, just lie down.

158
00:07:30,980 --> 00:07:31,980
You are really too polite.

159
00:07:31,980 --> 00:07:33,420
- Slowly.
- I have to get up.

160
00:07:33,580 --> 00:07:34,260
Slow down.

161
00:07:34,780 --> 00:07:35,900
I really have to sit up.

162
00:07:35,900 --> 00:07:36,780
How about this?

163
00:07:36,780 --> 00:07:38,500
You are being far too polite.

164
00:07:38,780 --> 00:07:39,550
Polite about what?

165
00:07:39,550 --> 00:07:41,250
- What are you saying?
- You came all this way to see me.

166
00:07:42,860 --> 00:07:43,580
Bichen.

167
00:07:43,740 --> 00:07:44,650
Auntie.

168
00:07:45,020 --> 00:07:46,040
Good girl.

169
00:07:48,180 --> 00:07:50,340
I have been stuck here
in bed since I got sick.

170
00:07:50,740 --> 00:07:52,700
Your wedding has been delayed
because of me.

171
00:07:52,700 --> 00:07:54,080
You do not blame me, do you?

172
00:07:54,080 --> 00:07:54,980
Auntie, of course not.

173
00:07:54,980 --> 00:07:56,170
Please do not say that.

174
00:07:56,170 --> 00:07:57,510
Exactly. Not at all.

175
00:07:58,380 --> 00:07:59,790
Do not stand, have a seat.

176
00:07:59,790 --> 00:08:00,420
Alright.

177
00:08:00,610 --> 00:08:01,620
Are you lying comfortably?

178
00:08:04,570 --> 00:08:08,140
I had a real brush with death this time.

179
00:08:08,340 --> 00:08:09,260
I have missed you.

180
00:08:09,980 --> 00:08:10,740
Yu.

181
00:08:10,900 --> 00:08:12,420
Please do not say that.

182
00:08:12,660 --> 00:08:14,830
A wedding is something
for both families.

183
00:08:15,020 --> 00:08:16,820
I should contribute as well.

184
00:08:18,300 --> 00:08:18,900
Right.

185
00:08:19,500 --> 00:08:20,220
Look.

186
00:08:20,620 --> 00:08:22,180
I asked someone to pick a date.

187
00:08:22,460 --> 00:08:23,060
Here.

188
00:08:23,060 --> 00:08:24,700
The 26th of this month

189
00:08:24,700 --> 00:08:26,320
is an especially good day for a wedding.

190
00:08:26,320 --> 00:08:27,550
A really auspicious date.

191
00:08:27,700 --> 00:08:28,380
So I think

192
00:08:28,380 --> 00:08:30,340
we should simply hold the wedding

193
00:08:30,340 --> 00:08:31,660
for both children on that day.

194
00:08:34,180 --> 00:08:36,140
The 26th of this month.

195
00:08:36,140 --> 00:08:37,620
A good day.

196
00:08:38,300 --> 00:08:39,340
Alright.

197
00:08:40,860 --> 00:08:43,260
Yes, it is a good date.

198
00:08:44,980 --> 00:08:46,420
But I am... You see I am...

199
00:08:46,660 --> 00:08:48,420
I still here in hospital.

200
00:08:49,220 --> 00:08:51,090
I have not prepared anything at all.

201
00:08:51,090 --> 00:08:52,900
Is it too rushed?

202
00:08:52,900 --> 00:08:53,620
Yu.

203
00:08:53,780 --> 00:08:55,540
I understand, I really do.

204
00:08:57,310 --> 00:08:59,500
But as people say,
when a man grows up he should marry,

205
00:08:59,510 --> 00:09:00,460
and a woman should wed.

206
00:09:01,060 --> 00:09:02,500
Both children are no longer young.

207
00:09:02,900 --> 00:09:05,420
Even Bichen's classmate's child
is already in kindergarten.

208
00:09:06,590 --> 00:09:07,150
Yes.

209
00:09:07,150 --> 00:09:08,450
As parents,

210
00:09:08,620 --> 00:09:10,730
we should hurry
and get their wedding done.

211
00:09:10,890 --> 00:09:12,740
Then our duty is complete, right?

212
00:09:13,220 --> 00:09:14,290
Yes.

213
00:09:14,290 --> 00:09:16,350
We can keep the wedding simple.

214
00:09:17,480 --> 00:09:19,050
Just follow what we agreed before.

215
00:09:19,290 --> 00:09:20,250
A dowry of 200,000 yuan,

216
00:09:20,420 --> 00:09:21,820
and a small flat will do.

217
00:09:22,220 --> 00:09:23,580
Auntie, do not worry.

218
00:09:23,580 --> 00:09:25,740
My mom already agreed earlier.

219
00:09:25,900 --> 00:09:27,730
Yes, it is all settled.

220
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:29,380
Everything is settled.

221
00:09:31,460 --> 00:09:32,100
Well.

222
00:09:32,820 --> 00:09:33,920
Zhidong.

223
00:09:34,180 --> 00:09:35,540
Your dad made this soup for me.

224
00:09:35,540 --> 00:09:36,880
I should drink it while it is hot.

225
00:09:36,890 --> 00:09:37,780
Otherwise it will go cold.

226
00:09:37,780 --> 00:09:39,070
Auntie, I will serve it for you.

227
00:09:47,140 --> 00:09:47,930
What happened?

228
00:09:48,580 --> 00:09:49,330
- Bichen.
- Chen.

229
00:09:49,330 --> 00:09:50,090
What is wrong?

230
00:09:50,220 --> 00:09:50,770
Chen.

231
00:09:51,340 --> 00:09:51,980
I am fine.

232
00:09:52,420 --> 00:09:54,900
She probably kicked off the quilt
at night and caught a chill.

233
00:09:59,660 --> 00:10:02,100
The weather...

234
00:10:02,340 --> 00:10:03,660
She needs to keep warm.

235
00:10:04,380 --> 00:10:05,260
Bichen.

236
00:10:05,700 --> 00:10:07,460
Are are you feeling any better?

237
00:10:07,460 --> 00:10:08,460
I am fine, Auntie.

238
00:10:08,460 --> 00:10:09,720
She's fine, Yu.

239
00:10:10,060 --> 00:10:10,710
In that case,

240
00:10:11,220 --> 00:10:12,820
take your time and rest.

241
00:10:13,620 --> 00:10:15,030
I will take Bichen home first.

242
00:10:15,700 --> 00:10:17,180
Auntie, we will head off then.

243
00:10:17,180 --> 00:10:17,700
Off you go.

244
00:10:17,700 --> 00:10:18,420
Mom, I will walk them out.

245
00:10:18,420 --> 00:10:19,340
Alright, alright.

246
00:10:19,660 --> 00:10:21,110
When I am discharged,

247
00:10:21,340 --> 00:10:23,460
come over to the house
and sit for a bit.

248
00:10:39,120 --> 00:10:40,020
Still feeling unwell?

249
00:10:40,740 --> 00:10:41,500
A bit better.

250
00:10:42,660 --> 00:10:44,020
You threw up all your breakfast.

251
00:10:44,180 --> 00:10:45,500
I will buy you a hot milk tea.

252
00:10:46,060 --> 00:10:46,590
No.

253
00:10:46,590 --> 00:10:47,300
It is not healthy.

254
00:10:48,460 --> 00:10:50,500
The milk tea princess
says milk tea is not healthy.

255
00:10:52,500 --> 00:10:53,900
Are you pregnant?

256
00:10:54,740 --> 00:10:55,340
Get lost.

257
00:10:55,900 --> 00:10:57,110
I was joking.

258
00:10:57,460 --> 00:10:58,020
Zhidong.

259
00:10:58,380 --> 00:10:59,340
No need to walk us out.

260
00:10:59,940 --> 00:11:00,420
Let us go.

261
00:11:01,260 --> 00:11:01,940
I am leaving.

262
00:11:02,420 --> 00:11:03,140
Go back inside.

263
00:11:03,900 --> 00:11:04,700
Goodbye, Auntie.

264
00:11:10,340 --> 00:11:11,210
They have gone.

265
00:11:14,340 --> 00:11:14,780
Chen,

266
00:11:14,780 --> 00:11:16,900
send me a WeChat message
when you reach home.

267
00:11:19,700 --> 00:11:23,500
How is Bichen's health usually?

268
00:11:23,820 --> 00:11:24,540
Better than mine.

269
00:11:28,660 --> 00:11:31,220
She has been eating and drinking

270
00:11:31,540 --> 00:11:32,620
normally these days, right?

271
00:11:32,620 --> 00:11:33,940
Mom, do not worry.

272
00:11:33,940 --> 00:11:34,980
She said just now

273
00:11:35,040 --> 00:11:36,460
that her stomach felt uncomfortable.

274
00:11:37,020 --> 00:11:38,840
I offered to buy her milk tea
but she refused.

275
00:11:44,420 --> 00:11:46,220
Good lad, my son.

276
00:11:48,500 --> 00:11:48,980
Mom.

277
00:11:50,180 --> 00:11:51,300
What are you thinking about?

278
00:11:52,460 --> 00:11:54,180
I mean, Chen and I

279
00:11:55,220 --> 00:11:56,580
are usually very careful.

280
00:12:15,940 --> 00:12:16,660
Ni.

281
00:12:17,990 --> 00:12:18,660
Why are you here?

282
00:12:18,660 --> 00:12:19,260
Get lost.

283
00:12:19,280 --> 00:12:20,460
Why are you dressed like this?

284
00:12:20,460 --> 00:12:21,420
Do whatever you like somewhere else.

285
00:12:21,420 --> 00:12:22,740
I have not caused trouble lately.

286
00:12:44,060 --> 00:12:44,860
Mr. Hu.

287
00:12:47,220 --> 00:12:48,460
Have something nice to eat.

288
00:12:48,780 --> 00:12:49,260
You...

289
00:12:49,260 --> 00:12:50,060
Take it.

290
00:12:52,070 --> 00:12:54,290
You coming here every day,
it does not affect your work?

291
00:12:54,460 --> 00:12:55,260
See you tomorrow.

292
00:12:57,020 --> 00:12:59,100
Then the lunch box from yesterday...

293
00:13:32,380 --> 00:13:39,700
(Nanzhou Dianlan Group
Mid-level Post Competition Meeting)

294
00:13:39,700 --> 00:13:41,940
Next candidate, Zhang Hao.

295
00:13:57,640 --> 00:13:58,260
Hello, everyone.

296
00:13:58,260 --> 00:14:00,120
I am Zhang Hao
from the Administration Office.

297
00:14:01,260 --> 00:14:03,180
I am Zhang Hao
from the Administration Office.

298
00:14:04,620 --> 00:14:06,300
The position I am applying for is

299
00:14:06,940 --> 00:14:08,390
Head of Human Resources.

300
00:14:08,940 --> 00:14:10,740
Since joining
Dianlan Group 12 years ago,

301
00:14:10,740 --> 00:14:12,820
I have always worked in administration

302
00:14:12,820 --> 00:14:14,620
and human resources.

303
00:14:14,980 --> 00:14:16,350
For the annual campus recruitment

304
00:14:16,350 --> 00:14:18,170
and major recruitment fairs
in the industry,

305
00:14:18,170 --> 00:14:19,680
I have always been the lead organizer.

306
00:14:23,060 --> 00:14:24,260
This feels wonderful.

307
00:14:26,100 --> 00:14:26,900
Yu.

308
00:14:27,460 --> 00:14:28,700
Daughters really are the best.

309
00:14:28,980 --> 00:14:30,500
Yes.

310
00:14:30,760 --> 00:14:32,170
A daughter looks after you properly.

311
00:14:32,170 --> 00:14:34,100
That is why I am about to be discharged.

312
00:14:34,940 --> 00:14:35,990
That is rare.

313
00:14:36,460 --> 00:14:37,860
You are actually praising me.

314
00:14:38,900 --> 00:14:40,260
Gently, you.

315
00:14:43,260 --> 00:14:43,980
What is it?

316
00:14:46,100 --> 00:14:48,220
If I want to praise you,
do I have to say it out loud?

317
00:14:50,140 --> 00:14:51,380
Where else would I put it then?

318
00:14:52,660 --> 00:14:53,700
In a red envelope.

319
00:14:53,700 --> 00:14:54,580
Come on, give me your phone.

320
00:14:54,580 --> 00:14:55,340
Send me a red envelope.

321
00:14:55,340 --> 00:14:56,260
You cheeky girl.

322
00:14:56,500 --> 00:14:57,260
Stop messing about.

323
00:14:57,460 --> 00:14:58,860
You are always fooling around here.

324
00:15:01,260 --> 00:15:02,860
I have something serious to tell you.

325
00:15:02,860 --> 00:15:05,260
You change the subject
as soon as I mention red envelopes.

326
00:15:06,260 --> 00:15:08,810
Alright, tell me the serious thing.

327
00:15:16,420 --> 00:15:17,520
It is about Bichen.

328
00:15:20,260 --> 00:15:21,580
She might be pregnant.

329
00:15:22,380 --> 00:15:23,260
Are you serious?

330
00:15:24,060 --> 00:15:24,740
Yes.

331
00:15:27,660 --> 00:15:28,810
Your brother

332
00:15:33,420 --> 00:15:34,260
really is something.

333
00:15:35,420 --> 00:15:36,060
Mom.

334
00:15:36,460 --> 00:15:38,260
Is this really something to praise?

335
00:15:41,420 --> 00:15:43,220
Why are you pulling such a long face?

336
00:15:43,220 --> 00:15:45,260
There is no one else here,
just the two of us.

337
00:15:45,340 --> 00:15:46,900
We can talk properly.

338
00:15:46,900 --> 00:15:47,750
If she is pregnant,

339
00:15:47,750 --> 00:15:48,700
then the wedding

340
00:15:48,700 --> 00:15:49,820
needs to be arranged soon.

341
00:15:50,040 --> 00:15:51,740
You should quickly
take that 200,000 yuan

342
00:15:51,740 --> 00:15:53,180
to Bichen's family.

343
00:15:54,340 --> 00:15:54,940
And

344
00:15:55,500 --> 00:15:57,260
for the banquet and the wedding company,

345
00:15:57,520 --> 00:15:58,500
ask Mingzhu to handle it.

346
00:15:58,500 --> 00:15:59,660
No, wait.

347
00:15:59,790 --> 00:16:01,660
No, this is not urgent.

348
00:16:01,820 --> 00:16:04,060
For her to start showing,

349
00:16:04,340 --> 00:16:06,660
it will still take some time.

350
00:16:07,500 --> 00:16:09,220
I was thinking,

351
00:16:11,060 --> 00:16:11,700
well,

352
00:16:12,740 --> 00:16:14,250
about Bichen.

353
00:16:14,250 --> 00:16:16,760
She is already pregnant now.

354
00:16:16,940 --> 00:16:17,940
So I was thinking,

355
00:16:18,260 --> 00:16:19,940
what is done is done,

356
00:16:19,940 --> 00:16:21,160
and about the bride price...

357
00:16:21,160 --> 00:16:22,420
Are you out of your mind?

358
00:16:22,420 --> 00:16:23,500
You gave me a fright.

359
00:16:23,500 --> 00:16:24,060
What are you thinking?

360
00:16:24,060 --> 00:16:25,820
Where did you even get such an idea?

361
00:16:25,820 --> 00:16:26,340
No...

362
00:16:26,340 --> 00:16:27,980
That baby in her belly
is your own grandchild.

363
00:16:27,980 --> 00:16:28,700
I know that.

364
00:16:28,700 --> 00:16:30,370
If she marries
into this family and finds out,

365
00:16:30,370 --> 00:16:31,660
how will she see you and our family?

366
00:16:31,660 --> 00:16:32,370
But...

367
00:16:32,370 --> 00:16:33,840
You have already failed one daughter.

368
00:16:33,860 --> 00:16:35,820
You cannot fail
another family's daughter as well.

369
00:16:35,820 --> 00:16:36,620
I did not.

370
00:16:36,620 --> 00:16:37,740
Listen to me, Mom.

371
00:16:37,740 --> 00:16:39,800
If Jiao's future in-laws
ever dare to do this to her,

372
00:16:39,800 --> 00:16:40,810
I will be the first to fight them.

373
00:16:40,810 --> 00:16:41,750
I would tear them apart.

374
00:17:09,660 --> 00:17:12,620
(20 percent off after 8:00 PM)

I will just pay the full price.

380
00:18:02,760 --> 00:18:03,780
Charge me whatever it is.

381
00:18:04,300 --> 00:18:04,980
Alright.

382
00:18:06,460 --> 00:18:07,340
I will scan your code.

383
00:18:08,100 --> 00:18:09,180
(First-round shortlisted candidates)
Here.

384
00:18:09,580 --> 00:18:11,820
Sir, this is not your payment code.

385
00:18:13,060 --> 00:18:13,950
I tapped the wrong one.

386
00:18:14,700 --> 00:18:15,020
Here.

387
00:18:17,020 --> 00:18:17,700
Jiao.

388
00:18:21,660 --> 00:18:22,980
A doughnut.

389
00:18:25,260 --> 00:18:26,500
Chocolate flavour.

390
00:18:26,960 --> 00:18:28,660
Today you did not
buy the discounted ones.

391
00:18:28,780 --> 00:18:30,660
Today I paid full price.

392
00:18:30,840 --> 00:18:32,600
Zhang, you are being generous today.

393
00:18:33,100 --> 00:18:34,060
Spicy sticks.

394
00:18:34,060 --> 00:18:34,880
Spicy sticks?

395
00:18:35,180 --> 00:18:36,020
Crisps.

396
00:18:36,140 --> 00:18:36,970
Crisps?

397
00:18:36,970 --> 00:18:40,180
And your favourite milk toffee.

398
00:18:42,500 --> 00:18:44,300
But these are all junk food.

399
00:18:44,850 --> 00:18:46,180
Mom will not allow it.

400
00:18:46,290 --> 00:18:47,800
Mom does not allow you to eat them.

401
00:18:48,100 --> 00:18:49,400
Dad allows it. Eat.

402
00:18:50,580 --> 00:18:51,960
What is wrong with you today?

403
00:18:51,960 --> 00:18:53,020
I am standing up for once.

404
00:18:53,020 --> 00:18:53,980
What is going on?

405
00:18:57,040 --> 00:18:58,300
- Is everything really fine?
- Today my mom

406
00:18:58,300 --> 00:18:59,700
- nearly made me explode.
- Eat.

407
00:18:59,700 --> 00:19:01,900
You have no idea what that woman
has been up to.

408
00:19:06,760 --> 00:19:08,220
Jiao, how many times have I told you?

409
00:19:08,220 --> 00:19:10,180
You cannot eat these, do you understand?

410
00:19:10,180 --> 00:19:11,500
They are all junk food.

411
00:19:11,500 --> 00:19:12,300
You are still young.

412
00:19:12,520 --> 00:19:13,570
My dad bought them for me.

413
00:19:15,360 --> 00:19:16,500
He forced them into my hands.

414
00:19:17,300 --> 00:19:17,960
Zhang Hao.

415
00:19:18,180 --> 00:19:19,420
How many times have I told you?

416
00:19:19,420 --> 00:19:21,490
Children cannot eat this kind of junk.

417
00:19:21,490 --> 00:19:22,300
(First-round shortlisted candidates
of Lilan Group, Zhang Hao)

418
00:19:22,340 --> 00:19:23,140
What is this?

419
00:19:28,020 --> 00:19:28,950
You made the shortlist?

420
00:19:29,560 --> 00:19:30,500
No gifts.

421
00:19:30,860 --> 00:19:31,860
No treating anyone.

422
00:19:32,220 --> 00:19:33,620
And I still reached the final round.

423
00:19:34,340 --> 00:19:36,940
So I would like to invite Miss Jiao

424
00:19:37,140 --> 00:19:38,060
to share a spicy stick.

425
00:19:38,060 --> 00:19:39,260
Do you think that is too much?

426
00:19:42,380 --> 00:19:43,020
Not at all.

427
00:19:44,740 --> 00:19:46,260
My left hand feels empty.

428
00:19:47,260 --> 00:19:49,260
Director Zhang.

429
00:19:49,340 --> 00:19:51,020
My right hand feels empty too.

430
00:19:52,620 --> 00:19:53,620
Dad.

431
00:19:55,820 --> 00:19:57,940
It feels great to have someone
on each side.

432
00:19:58,540 --> 00:19:59,460
I am hungry.

433
00:19:59,780 --> 00:20:01,900
Director Zhang, have you cooked?

434
00:20:02,460 --> 00:20:03,260
Cook what?

435
00:20:03,620 --> 00:20:04,380
We will eat out.

436
00:20:05,300 --> 00:20:06,060
Go cook.

437
00:20:06,060 --> 00:20:06,660
Alright.

438
00:20:07,210 --> 00:20:08,820
I actually bought the groceries already.

439
00:20:11,180 --> 00:20:11,780
Jiao.

440
00:20:11,780 --> 00:20:14,340
Your dad is about to become a director.

441
00:20:14,620 --> 00:20:16,220
Look what my dad bought me.

442
00:20:16,220 --> 00:20:18,180
A chocolate doughnut.

443
00:20:18,300 --> 00:20:19,340
So fancy.

444
00:20:25,820 --> 00:20:26,980
Minghui, come here.

445
00:20:28,420 --> 00:20:29,020
Sit.

446
00:20:34,360 --> 00:20:35,100
What do you want?

447
00:20:35,100 --> 00:20:35,740
Sugarcane.

448
00:20:36,840 --> 00:20:37,780
You are being generous.

449
00:20:42,500 --> 00:20:43,260
What do you want?

450
00:20:43,780 --> 00:20:45,060
Has Mr. Hu been acting strange

451
00:20:45,540 --> 00:20:46,780
at school recently?

452
00:20:48,060 --> 00:20:48,780
Mr. Hu?

453
00:20:50,100 --> 00:20:50,740
Yes.

454
00:20:51,220 --> 00:20:52,380
Every time class ends,

455
00:20:52,740 --> 00:20:55,900
he does this, this, and this.

456
00:20:56,220 --> 00:20:57,660
He is over the moon every day.

457
00:20:58,740 --> 00:20:59,700
Alright, got it.

458
00:21:01,100 --> 00:21:02,900
Do me a favour and work harder lately.

459
00:21:02,900 --> 00:21:04,180
Study properly.

460
00:21:04,180 --> 00:21:05,820
Otherwise I will lose face
going to school.

461
00:21:06,820 --> 00:21:07,620
Ni.

462
00:21:08,140 --> 00:21:09,860
Does my exam result

463
00:21:10,820 --> 00:21:12,020
have anything to do with you?

464
00:21:13,160 --> 00:21:14,450
- Do not do that.
- You brat.

465
00:21:15,090 --> 00:21:16,420
What should my dad cook tomorrow?

466
00:21:17,820 --> 00:21:18,740
Make spicy chicken.

467
00:21:19,220 --> 00:21:20,460
Mr. Hu does not eat spicy food.

468
00:21:21,260 --> 00:21:21,900
I do.

469
00:21:22,420 --> 00:21:23,380
The sugarcane is yours.

470
00:21:25,940 --> 00:21:27,020
Hope it burns your mouth.

471
00:21:29,820 --> 00:21:30,740
Thank you, Ni.

472
00:21:31,340 --> 00:21:31,980
You are welcome.

473
00:21:35,540 --> 00:21:36,720
The braised chops are here.

474
00:21:36,720 --> 00:21:37,560
Alright, thank you.

475
00:21:37,900 --> 00:21:38,570
Enjoy slowly.

476
00:21:38,570 --> 00:21:39,100
Thank you.

477
00:21:52,360 --> 00:21:53,540
Who ordered the spicy chicken?

478
00:21:55,660 --> 00:21:57,100
Mr. Hu Gang ordered it.

479
00:22:00,340 --> 00:22:02,180
Mr. Hu Gang ordered for himself?

480
00:22:03,140 --> 00:22:04,490
You added too many chillies.

481
00:22:04,940 --> 00:22:06,640
He must think of us as his own.

482
00:22:06,820 --> 00:22:07,290
The heat...

483
00:22:07,290 --> 00:22:08,500
Is the heat too high?

484
00:22:18,140 --> 00:22:18,900
This tastes great.

485
00:22:24,140 --> 00:22:26,100
You did not deliver
that love packed meal to him?

486
00:22:27,100 --> 00:22:28,260
Love should not be overused.

487
00:22:28,620 --> 00:22:29,860
Once anything becomes excessive,

488
00:22:29,860 --> 00:22:30,680
it becomes a problem.

489
00:22:30,980 --> 00:22:31,840
What are you here for?

490
00:22:32,660 --> 00:22:33,800
There is a case.

491
00:22:33,800 --> 00:22:35,560
I want to discuss
its feasibility with you.

492
00:22:37,380 --> 00:22:38,300
What is it? Tell me.

493
00:22:38,820 --> 00:22:40,900
The bride and groom have a request.

494
00:22:40,900 --> 00:22:41,680
It is a bit...

495
00:22:41,900 --> 00:22:42,740
A bit what?

496
00:22:44,340 --> 00:22:45,700
A bit unusual.

497
00:22:46,260 --> 00:22:46,940
How unusual?

498
00:22:47,380 --> 00:22:49,780
The groom's surname is Niu.
The bride is an Ox in the zodiac.

499
00:22:49,780 --> 00:22:51,660
They met during a company event
when they were feeding cows.

500
00:22:51,660 --> 00:22:52,380
So...

501
00:22:52,580 --> 00:22:53,220
So?

502
00:22:53,450 --> 00:22:55,900
They would like a cow
as a special guest.

503
00:23:00,980 --> 00:23:01,860
And this cow

504
00:23:02,220 --> 00:23:03,340
needs to perform?

505
00:23:03,340 --> 00:23:04,180
No.

506
00:23:04,420 --> 00:23:05,660
It only needs to stand there.

507
00:23:05,920 --> 00:23:06,860
But it cannot move

508
00:23:07,100 --> 00:23:08,540
and it cannot poop.

509
00:23:09,020 --> 00:23:10,660
That is easy. I can handle it.

510
00:23:10,660 --> 00:23:12,140
Do not agree so quickly.

511
00:23:12,140 --> 00:23:13,780
Think about
whether it is possible first.

512
00:23:13,790 --> 00:23:15,660
I signed the contract.
I have a responsibility.

513
00:23:16,220 --> 00:23:16,900
Mingzhu.

514
00:23:16,900 --> 00:23:18,340
Has pregnancy made you slow?

515
00:23:18,740 --> 00:23:20,200
That cattle farmer in the suburbs

516
00:23:20,200 --> 00:23:21,620
is Ni Debao's old mate.

517
00:23:22,100 --> 00:23:24,260
Getting a cow
to attend their banquet is easy.

518
00:23:25,700 --> 00:23:26,260
No.

519
00:23:26,260 --> 00:23:27,940
The cow needs to stand still.

520
00:23:27,940 --> 00:23:29,700
I know, it cannot poop.

521
00:23:29,700 --> 00:23:30,300
Right.

522
00:23:30,900 --> 00:23:31,580
Do not worry.

523
00:23:31,580 --> 00:23:32,980
You focus on signing the deal
and taking the deposit.

524
00:23:32,980 --> 00:23:34,140
I will handle the rest.

525
00:23:37,060 --> 00:23:37,700
Mingzhu.

526
00:23:37,700 --> 00:23:40,010
Your dad's spicy chicken tastes great.

527
00:23:41,660 --> 00:23:43,430
My dad thought he made it for Mr. Hu.

528
00:23:43,660 --> 00:23:44,620
Got excited for nothing.

529
00:23:44,620 --> 00:23:45,940
Just wait until I win Mr. Hu over.

530
00:23:46,760 --> 00:23:48,620
Ordering food will be
the same as him ordering.

531
00:23:48,620 --> 00:23:49,340
No difference.

532
00:23:49,660 --> 00:23:51,360
Do not brag too soon.

533
00:23:51,660 --> 00:23:52,500
Do not forget

534
00:23:52,500 --> 00:23:55,020
you are still dressed like Feng Meiqi.

535
00:23:55,020 --> 00:23:55,900
What does that mean?

536
00:23:56,140 --> 00:23:57,200
It means in his heart,

537
00:23:57,200 --> 00:23:58,740
he has not let go of Feng Meiqi.

538
00:24:00,300 --> 00:24:00,780
Soon.

539
00:24:01,100 --> 00:24:01,860
Very soon.

540
00:24:02,850 --> 00:24:03,660
Is it working?

541
00:24:07,900 --> 00:24:08,480
It's over.

542
00:24:08,980 --> 00:24:10,620
You have really dragged me into trouble.

543
00:24:15,300 --> 00:24:17,990
A person holding roses needs no gods.

544
00:24:20,060 --> 00:24:20,780
Mr. Hu.

545
00:24:27,140 --> 00:24:28,140
Show me your homework.

546
00:24:41,220 --> 00:24:41,980
Shen Minghui.

547
00:24:43,460 --> 00:24:45,860
Do you have another sister?

548
00:24:46,340 --> 00:24:47,020
Who?

549
00:24:48,500 --> 00:24:49,280
Ni?

550
00:24:50,860 --> 00:24:52,130
Her surname is Ni.

551
00:24:52,980 --> 00:24:53,980
Why is yours Shen?

552
00:24:54,540 --> 00:24:55,620
She is not my real sister.

553
00:24:58,460 --> 00:24:59,420
Is she alright?

554
00:24:59,580 --> 00:25:00,460
What happened?

555
00:25:03,460 --> 00:25:04,060
Nothing.

556
00:25:05,740 --> 00:25:06,420
Mr. Hu.

557
00:25:07,380 --> 00:25:08,220
Do you like her?

558
00:25:08,900 --> 00:25:11,020
Children should not pry.

559
00:25:13,740 --> 00:25:14,940
You got this one wrong again.

560
00:25:14,940 --> 00:25:16,420
I explained it to you yesterday.

561
00:25:16,540 --> 00:25:17,140
Do it again.

562
00:25:22,060 --> 00:25:22,580
(Ni)

563
00:25:26,420 --> 00:25:27,500
If you call out to me,

564
00:25:27,840 --> 00:25:28,780
I will turn around.

565
00:25:32,780 --> 00:25:33,780
What are you staring at?

566
00:25:34,300 --> 00:25:36,100
Get on with your work.

567
00:25:51,540 --> 00:25:52,420
I do not understand.

568
00:25:52,420 --> 00:25:53,820
You run a wedding business.

569
00:25:53,820 --> 00:25:55,340
Why do you need to borrow a cow?

570
00:25:55,660 --> 00:25:57,370
Competition is tough now.

571
00:25:57,370 --> 00:25:59,110
Whatever the client wants, we deliver.

572
00:25:59,120 --> 00:26:00,060
Even if they want a demon king,

573
00:26:00,060 --> 00:26:01,140
I have to get it.

574
00:26:03,070 --> 00:26:05,780
The cow itself is not hard to sort out.

575
00:26:06,900 --> 00:26:07,380
But...

576
00:26:07,380 --> 00:26:08,370
Stop beating around the bush.

577
00:26:08,380 --> 00:26:09,300
You want money?

578
00:26:10,660 --> 00:26:11,950
If you want money, you get money.

579
00:26:12,220 --> 00:26:13,180
Say it earlier.

580
00:26:13,190 --> 00:26:14,360
Say it earlier that I will get money.

581
00:26:14,360 --> 00:26:15,290
I will sort this out

582
00:26:15,290 --> 00:26:16,300
properly for you.

583
00:26:18,740 --> 00:26:20,220
Your face looks pale.

584
00:26:20,900 --> 00:26:21,750
Are you unwell?

585
00:26:22,420 --> 00:26:23,500
So you can tell I am ill.

586
00:26:24,700 --> 00:26:25,460
Then that's right.

587
00:26:29,700 --> 00:26:31,610
Class, be mindful of the time.

588
00:26:32,260 --> 00:26:34,700
For big questions,
think for at most five minutes.

589
00:26:35,020 --> 00:26:37,460
If you cannot solve it, move on.

590
00:27:03,780 --> 00:27:05,180
(WeChat. Ni)

591
00:27:05,190 --> 00:27:06,580
(Ni: Hello Mr. Hu,
I am Shen Minghui's sister)

592
00:27:12,700 --> 00:27:15,780
(Hello)

593
00:27:29,820 --> 00:27:33,260
Three, two, one.

594
00:27:34,980 --> 00:27:35,780
Mr. Hu.

595
00:27:37,780 --> 00:27:38,540
What is wrong?

596
00:27:38,820 --> 00:27:39,980
Are you feeling unwell?

597
00:27:40,460 --> 00:27:41,620
I had a cold a few days ago.

598
00:27:41,620 --> 00:27:42,860
I still have a bit of a cough.

599
00:27:42,900 --> 00:27:44,580
I came just to say hello.

600
00:27:44,860 --> 00:27:46,300
I did not bring you food these days.

601
00:27:46,460 --> 00:27:47,700
You did not starve, did you?

602
00:27:47,700 --> 00:27:48,280
No.

603
00:27:48,280 --> 00:27:50,780
The canteen is convenient enough for me.

604
00:27:51,860 --> 00:27:52,900
Minghui's sister...

605
00:27:52,900 --> 00:27:53,780
My name is Ni.

606
00:27:55,780 --> 00:27:56,420
Ni.

607
00:27:57,380 --> 00:27:58,860
You do not look well.

608
00:27:58,860 --> 00:28:00,380
Shall I buy you some chicken soup

609
00:28:00,460 --> 00:28:01,340
to help you recover?

610
00:28:02,180 --> 00:28:03,140
If you are busy...

611
00:28:03,140 --> 00:28:03,930
I am free.

612
00:28:05,700 --> 00:28:07,870
Alright, I will head upstairs then.

613
00:28:07,870 --> 00:28:08,300
Okay.

614
00:28:11,300 --> 00:28:11,910
Wait for me.

615
00:28:13,700 --> 00:28:14,740
Please wait for me.

616
00:28:27,940 --> 00:28:28,700
This way please.

617
00:28:35,660 --> 00:28:36,460
Please have a seat.

618
00:28:42,020 --> 00:28:42,630
Excuse me.

619
00:28:42,630 --> 00:28:43,780
We would like to order.

620
00:28:44,060 --> 00:28:45,900
I am sorry.
Our dishes are displayed openly.

621
00:28:45,900 --> 00:28:47,150
You need to select them in the kitchen.

622
00:28:47,660 --> 00:28:48,060
Then...

623
00:28:48,330 --> 00:28:49,300
Then let us go together.

624
00:28:49,420 --> 00:28:50,580
No need. You choose.

625
00:28:50,850 --> 00:28:52,200
I have brought you food for days.

626
00:28:52,200 --> 00:28:53,560
I know we like the same flavours.

627
00:28:54,820 --> 00:28:55,340
Alright.

628
00:28:55,580 --> 00:28:57,820
I will get one chicken soup

629
00:28:58,300 --> 00:29:00,180
and one meat dish
and one vegetable. Enough?

630
00:29:00,180 --> 00:29:00,920
More than enough.

631
00:29:02,100 --> 00:29:02,700
Okay.

632
00:29:02,710 --> 00:29:03,340
Show me the way.

633
00:29:03,340 --> 00:29:03,900
This way.

634
00:29:14,850 --> 00:29:15,820
Hello, what is it?

635
00:29:16,140 --> 00:29:17,260
I just want to ask you.

636
00:29:17,260 --> 00:29:18,500
Is the cow sorted out?

637
00:29:18,630 --> 00:29:20,720
Do not worry. It is sorted.

638
00:29:20,720 --> 00:29:21,380
Let me tell you.

639
00:29:21,550 --> 00:29:22,790
Not only the cow is sorted.

640
00:29:23,260 --> 00:29:24,420
Hu Gang is almost sorted too.

641
00:29:25,540 --> 00:29:26,300
What did you do?

642
00:29:27,380 --> 00:29:29,460
I am just showing him concern.

643
00:29:29,470 --> 00:29:31,440
I told him I have not
brought him food for days.

644
00:29:32,060 --> 00:29:33,500
I was afraid he might go hungry.

645
00:29:34,860 --> 00:29:37,460
Before he met you,
he never ate properly anyway.

646
00:29:38,140 --> 00:29:38,530
Hello.

647
00:29:38,660 --> 00:29:39,180
Yes.

648
00:29:39,180 --> 00:29:40,230
Move in.

649
00:29:40,540 --> 00:29:41,150
Yes.

650
00:29:41,150 --> 00:29:41,580
Here.

651
00:29:41,580 --> 00:29:42,300
Mr. Hu, yes?

652
00:29:42,300 --> 00:29:42,940
Your takeaway.

653
00:29:43,060 --> 00:29:44,180
Thank you.

654
00:29:47,980 --> 00:29:48,660
Exactly.

655
00:29:48,660 --> 00:29:49,740
I barely eaten.

656
00:29:50,360 --> 00:29:52,220
Luckily my friend felt sorry for me

657
00:29:52,460 --> 00:29:53,700
and brought me for chicken soup.

658
00:29:55,100 --> 00:29:56,290
I will talk to you later.

659
00:29:58,520 --> 00:29:59,950
I have finished ordering the dishes.

660
00:30:00,420 --> 00:30:02,940
I just heard you coughing again,

661
00:30:03,460 --> 00:30:04,720
so I bought you some medicine.

662
00:30:08,580 --> 00:30:09,690
Good food with good medicine

663
00:30:10,500 --> 00:30:11,740
helps you recover faster.

664
00:30:13,140 --> 00:30:13,900
Mr. Hu.

665
00:30:14,220 --> 00:30:15,230
You are very thoughtful.

666
00:30:18,420 --> 00:30:19,660
You can take it after the meal.

667
00:30:28,140 --> 00:30:29,300
Hello, Miss Zhang.

668
00:30:29,700 --> 00:30:31,660
I checked with the wedding planners.

669
00:30:31,740 --> 00:30:33,060
The cow is arranged.

670
00:30:33,940 --> 00:30:36,820
This chicken soup is rich in protein.

671
00:30:37,140 --> 00:30:39,170
It can boost your immunity.

672
00:30:39,720 --> 00:30:41,810
It works very well against a cold.

673
00:30:42,300 --> 00:30:44,170
You will get better quickly
after drinking it.

674
00:30:44,710 --> 00:30:45,420
Mr. Hu.

675
00:30:45,630 --> 00:30:46,920
How do you know all this?

676
00:30:48,100 --> 00:30:48,980
Not really.

677
00:30:49,860 --> 00:30:50,620
Careful, it is hot.

678
00:30:51,460 --> 00:30:53,340
Thank you, you are very kind.

679
00:30:53,980 --> 00:30:54,780
Not really.

680
00:31:00,180 --> 00:31:01,140
Water celery with tofu.

681
00:31:01,500 --> 00:31:02,180
Thank you.

682
00:31:03,300 --> 00:31:05,540
How about some warm yellow rice wine
for you two?

683
00:31:05,540 --> 00:31:06,360
It warms the stomach.

684
00:31:06,820 --> 00:31:08,100
I do not drink.

685
00:31:08,100 --> 00:31:09,020
She has a cold.

686
00:31:09,020 --> 00:31:10,060
She cannot drink either.

687
00:31:10,060 --> 00:31:11,380
I want a little.

688
00:31:11,820 --> 00:31:13,100
Warm it with some ginger.

689
00:31:13,100 --> 00:31:14,070
It drives out the cold.

690
00:31:14,140 --> 00:31:15,140
Is that so?

691
00:31:15,780 --> 00:31:16,310
Alright.

692
00:31:16,310 --> 00:31:17,640
We will take a pot then.

693
00:31:18,300 --> 00:31:19,270
But I drove.

694
00:31:20,340 --> 00:31:21,060
It is fine,

695
00:31:21,700 --> 00:31:22,500
I have a license.

696
00:31:22,980 --> 00:31:24,020
That is great.

697
00:31:25,020 --> 00:31:25,980
Thank you, boss.

698
00:31:25,980 --> 00:31:26,950
Alright, coming right up.

699
00:31:30,500 --> 00:31:31,340
Here are the keys.

700
00:31:32,340 --> 00:31:34,220
Mr. Hu, you teach physics.

701
00:31:34,360 --> 00:31:36,060
You must be very good at driving.

702
00:31:37,140 --> 00:31:37,580
I...

703
00:31:38,980 --> 00:31:39,860
I am not sure.

704
00:31:42,270 --> 00:31:43,340
I only just got my license

705
00:31:43,340 --> 00:31:44,750
and have not even driven
on the road yet.

706
00:31:47,650 --> 00:31:49,450
Then I am really lucky

707
00:31:49,450 --> 00:31:51,220
to be here for your first time.

708
00:31:56,140 --> 00:31:56,660
Well...

709
00:32:00,680 --> 00:32:01,300
It tastes good.

710
00:32:01,320 --> 00:32:01,940
It really does.

711
00:32:04,260 --> 00:32:05,020
Meiqi.

712
00:32:05,420 --> 00:32:07,640
I think Mr. Hu is quite decent.

713
00:32:07,640 --> 00:32:08,140
He is.

714
00:32:08,220 --> 00:32:10,380
He is educated and has a steady job.

715
00:32:10,400 --> 00:32:11,410
What more could you want.

716
00:32:11,780 --> 00:32:13,180
He is just a bit dull.

717
00:32:13,350 --> 00:32:14,940
Interesting or dull is all relative.

718
00:32:14,940 --> 00:32:16,700
Yes, your dad is right.

719
00:32:17,140 --> 00:32:18,740
Think about your brother as a child.

720
00:32:18,930 --> 00:32:19,740
Stubborn as anything.

721
00:32:19,740 --> 00:32:20,690
Absolutely rigid.

722
00:32:21,090 --> 00:32:23,140
We both thought

723
00:32:23,300 --> 00:32:25,300
he would struggle to find a girlfriend.

724
00:32:25,520 --> 00:32:26,680
Yet in his second year of uni,

725
00:32:26,680 --> 00:32:28,380
he managed
to win your sister-in-law over.

726
00:32:28,500 --> 00:32:29,530
Jianqi is stubborn.

727
00:32:30,070 --> 00:32:31,120
Once he decides something,

728
00:32:31,120 --> 00:32:32,260
nothing will change his mind.

729
00:32:32,260 --> 00:32:33,220
But still,

730
00:32:33,300 --> 00:32:35,300
he is a sweetheart.

731
00:32:35,720 --> 00:32:37,170
Far warmer than Hu Gang.

732
00:32:37,980 --> 00:32:39,820
Men need a bit of guidance.

733
00:32:39,820 --> 00:32:41,260
You have to teach them, right?

734
00:32:41,940 --> 00:32:43,980
Mr. Hu cares about you so much,

735
00:32:43,980 --> 00:32:45,740
yet you suddenly stopped talking to him.

736
00:32:46,290 --> 00:32:48,680
He is probably pining at home right now.

737
00:32:48,780 --> 00:32:50,040
Unable to eat or sleep.

738
00:32:50,040 --> 00:32:50,750
Serves him right.

739
00:32:51,140 --> 00:32:52,100
He is far too slow.

740
00:32:57,580 --> 00:32:58,540
Sorry.

741
00:32:58,780 --> 00:33:00,780
I am still not very practiced.

742
00:33:02,060 --> 00:33:02,700
Not at all.

743
00:33:02,980 --> 00:33:04,410
You have a great sense of direction.

744
00:33:04,480 --> 00:33:05,380
If you had not said so,

745
00:33:05,380 --> 00:33:06,920
I would have thought
you had years of experience.

746
00:33:07,180 --> 00:33:07,820
Really?

747
00:33:14,420 --> 00:33:15,980
Sorry.

748
00:33:15,980 --> 00:33:17,000
It is fine.

749
00:33:17,220 --> 00:33:18,890
Look at how quick your reactions are.

750
00:33:18,890 --> 00:33:20,260
Your speed control is excellent.

751
00:33:20,590 --> 00:33:21,340
You are doing well.

752
00:33:26,300 --> 00:33:29,140
I think I am starting to get used to it.

753
00:33:29,140 --> 00:33:31,140
See, I told you.

754
00:33:31,260 --> 00:33:32,400
You physics people

755
00:33:32,400 --> 00:33:33,700
always have a gift for driving.

756
00:33:34,940 --> 00:33:36,100
No, not at all.

757
00:33:36,780 --> 00:33:38,060
You encouraged me well.

758
00:33:39,580 --> 00:33:41,260
Mr. Hu, you know what?

759
00:33:41,580 --> 00:33:43,040
I have always admired

760
00:33:43,040 --> 00:33:44,260
science students like you.

761
00:33:44,540 --> 00:33:46,910
When it comes to circuits in series

762
00:33:46,910 --> 00:33:47,830
or in parallel,

763
00:33:48,140 --> 00:33:49,780
I can never make sense of them.

764
00:33:50,660 --> 00:33:52,180
But you understand them so clearly.

765
00:33:52,700 --> 00:33:53,300
Do I?

766
00:33:53,740 --> 00:33:55,030
If you want to learn,

767
00:33:55,030 --> 00:33:56,300
I can teach you.

768
00:33:58,500 --> 00:33:59,180
All right.

769
00:34:00,020 --> 00:34:00,700
But

770
00:34:01,460 --> 00:34:02,740
I might be a bit slow.

771
00:34:02,860 --> 00:34:04,300
What if I never get it?

772
00:34:06,780 --> 00:34:08,260
Well, that is possible.

773
00:34:13,580 --> 00:34:14,780
Then what should I do?

774
00:34:22,980 --> 00:34:24,060
I can teach you slowly.

775
00:34:24,260 --> 00:34:25,460
As long as you try,

776
00:34:25,620 --> 00:34:27,260
I am sure you will learn it.

777
00:34:30,300 --> 00:34:32,020
Anyway, if something breaks, you fix it.

778
00:34:32,620 --> 00:34:33,140
What?

779
00:34:34,780 --> 00:34:36,460
I said I will definitely try my best.

780
00:34:39,300 --> 00:34:39,940
Let us go.

781
00:34:53,540 --> 00:34:55,840
Shall I reach out

782
00:34:57,260 --> 00:34:58,740
and invite him over for dinner?

783
00:34:58,740 --> 00:34:59,940
Give him a way to step back in.

784
00:35:00,300 --> 00:35:01,120
No.

785
00:35:02,780 --> 00:35:05,670
If you do not speak to him
and he does not speak to you,

786
00:35:05,670 --> 00:35:07,460
you will stay stuck like this.

787
00:35:07,460 --> 00:35:08,300
I do not mind.

788
00:35:08,940 --> 00:35:10,370
I do not believe he can hold out.

789
00:35:11,750 --> 00:35:12,680
You do not understand.

790
00:35:12,920 --> 00:35:14,620
There has to be a rule in these things.

791
00:35:14,620 --> 00:35:16,260
Whoever gives in first loses.

792
00:35:16,780 --> 00:35:17,380
True.

793
00:35:17,900 --> 00:35:18,540
That is true.

794
00:35:19,220 --> 00:35:21,080
Fine, then let him stew for a bit.

795
00:35:21,180 --> 00:35:23,300
Let him reflect on himself properly.

796
00:35:24,620 --> 00:35:25,320
Well,

797
00:35:25,810 --> 00:35:27,300
Mr. Hu is quite a good catch.

798
00:35:27,780 --> 00:35:29,300
He might even have a girlfriend now.

799
00:35:29,300 --> 00:35:30,220
Impossible.

800
00:35:31,120 --> 00:35:32,840
He has been single
for nearly thirty years.

801
00:35:32,840 --> 00:35:34,450
How could he get one
the moment I step back?

802
00:35:35,300 --> 00:35:37,180
Exactly, Meiqi is right.

803
00:35:37,540 --> 00:35:38,180
Let me tell you.

804
00:35:38,180 --> 00:35:40,260
Even if he has a girlfriend now,

805
00:35:40,420 --> 00:35:41,880
he is only pretending.

806
00:35:41,880 --> 00:35:43,100
It is just to show Meiqi.

807
00:35:43,870 --> 00:35:46,130
That trick is called
playing hard to get.

808
00:35:47,300 --> 00:35:49,060
Mr. Hu is not that calculating.

809
00:35:49,250 --> 00:35:49,980
I can hear it.

810
00:35:50,940 --> 00:35:51,660
Meiqi,

811
00:35:52,100 --> 00:35:52,740
I think

812
00:35:52,740 --> 00:35:54,120
you still like that Mr. Hu.

813
00:35:54,740 --> 00:35:57,770
If you like him,
then be brave and go after him.

814
00:35:57,770 --> 00:35:58,750
Do not keep him waiting.

815
00:35:59,220 --> 00:35:59,980
I am telling you.

816
00:36:00,220 --> 00:36:01,980
It is just like doing a project.

817
00:36:02,140 --> 00:36:04,470
Until that final stamp goes down,

818
00:36:04,910 --> 00:36:06,060
everyone still has a chance.

819
00:36:06,260 --> 00:36:07,780
You do not understand. Eat your food.

820
00:36:07,780 --> 00:36:08,580
I do not understand?

821
00:36:09,160 --> 00:36:10,120
How do I not understand?

822
00:36:16,660 --> 00:36:18,180
Mom, Dad, I am done eating.

823
00:36:18,260 --> 00:36:19,370
You two take your time.

824
00:36:19,370 --> 00:36:20,370
I am heading back.

825
00:36:20,370 --> 00:36:21,180
- All right.
- You are done.

826
00:36:21,180 --> 00:36:21,740
You are done.

827
00:36:21,740 --> 00:36:22,370
Take your time.

828
00:36:22,370 --> 00:36:23,210
All right.

829
00:36:34,260 --> 00:36:34,780
Hello.

830
00:36:35,620 --> 00:36:36,580
I am sorry.

831
00:36:36,600 --> 00:36:37,900
I am in the middle of something.

832
00:36:38,100 --> 00:36:39,140
I will call you later.

833
00:36:43,580 --> 00:36:44,260
This is bad.

834
00:36:53,260 --> 00:36:54,300
Are you cold?

835
00:36:55,540 --> 00:36:58,020
Here, put my coat over your shoulders.

836
00:37:08,380 --> 00:37:10,470
Are you girls always afraid of the cold?

837
00:37:11,780 --> 00:37:12,780
We girls?

838
00:37:13,900 --> 00:37:16,940
We girls are not all that delicate.

839
00:37:17,740 --> 00:37:19,100
Here, Mr. Hu, put this on.

840
00:37:19,620 --> 00:37:20,500
Do not catch a chill.

841
00:37:21,060 --> 00:37:22,820
You still have not recovered
from your cold.

842
00:37:23,180 --> 00:37:23,580
No.

843
00:37:23,580 --> 00:37:25,100
The chicken soup fixed it.

844
00:37:25,700 --> 00:37:26,350
I feel stronger.

845
00:37:27,220 --> 00:37:27,780
Let us go.

846
00:37:29,900 --> 00:37:31,020
We girls...

847
00:37:36,980 --> 00:37:37,540
What is it?

848
00:37:37,980 --> 00:37:40,540
My bag, the cover slipped inside.

849
00:37:41,460 --> 00:37:42,660
This chicken soup is wonderful.

850
00:37:43,200 --> 00:37:44,780
I feel warm all over after drinking it.

851
00:37:45,980 --> 00:37:47,020
Yes, right.

852
00:37:47,220 --> 00:37:49,220
I said chicken soup works.

853
00:37:49,220 --> 00:37:49,900
Yes.

854
00:37:49,900 --> 00:37:50,460
It works.

855
00:37:58,180 --> 00:37:58,780
Dad.

856
00:38:02,060 --> 00:38:03,500
Where's he going this late?

857
00:38:12,700 --> 00:38:13,220
Mom.

858
00:38:13,220 --> 00:38:14,970
I bought some milk
and put it in the fridge.

859
00:38:15,080 --> 00:38:16,140
Do not forget to drink it.

860
00:38:16,140 --> 00:38:16,860
All right.

861
00:38:17,300 --> 00:38:18,340
When I went out just now,

862
00:38:18,340 --> 00:38:19,420
I saw Dad going out too.

863
00:38:19,580 --> 00:38:21,590
Some clients called him.

864
00:38:22,000 --> 00:38:23,220
They asked him to play mahjong.

865
00:38:23,580 --> 00:38:25,420
It is at the tea house
across the street.

866
00:38:25,420 --> 00:38:25,900
Yes.

867
00:38:26,480 --> 00:38:28,360
(Does he need to drive
for a place that close?)

868
00:38:30,900 --> 00:38:32,070
Mom, I am heading back.

869
00:38:32,200 --> 00:38:32,900
All right, go on.

870
00:38:38,340 --> 00:38:39,020
Jianqi.

871
00:38:39,700 --> 00:38:41,300
Your dad must have lied today.

872
00:38:44,180 --> 00:38:45,660
But why would he lie?

873
00:39:31,330 --> 00:39:32,100
Listen.

874
00:39:32,580 --> 00:39:34,580
I think my father-in-law
has been acting strange.

875
00:39:34,780 --> 00:39:35,420
What happened?

876
00:39:35,990 --> 00:39:37,530
Last night he told my mother-in-law,

877
00:39:37,530 --> 00:39:39,340
he was going to the tea house
across the road.

878
00:39:39,480 --> 00:39:40,980
But he drove off somewhere else.

879
00:39:41,060 --> 00:39:42,380
He came home very late.

880
00:39:42,580 --> 00:39:43,740
And he did not go inside.

881
00:39:44,020 --> 00:39:45,350
He just stood at the door smoking.

882
00:39:46,360 --> 00:39:48,780
Whether he is acting strange
or not is none of your business.

883
00:39:49,340 --> 00:39:50,220
Of course it is not.

884
00:39:50,220 --> 00:39:51,340
Then that is settled.

885
00:39:53,740 --> 00:39:56,460
Did you know your dad
had an affair when you were a kid?

886
00:39:56,700 --> 00:39:58,300
How could I not know?

887
00:39:58,460 --> 00:39:59,670
My mom made a huge scene.

888
00:39:59,670 --> 00:40:01,490
Even the old lady
selling buns heard about it.

889
00:40:02,340 --> 00:40:03,900
Then how are you so calm about it?

890
00:40:05,220 --> 00:40:06,540
What else can you do?

891
00:40:06,550 --> 00:40:08,660
If it rains, it rains, and if she
wants a divorce, she wants a divorce.

892
00:40:08,670 --> 00:40:10,810
Everyone should just manage themselves.

893
00:40:10,810 --> 00:40:12,090
If everyone manages themselves,

894
00:40:12,090 --> 00:40:14,460
the world would be a lovely place.

895
00:40:15,340 --> 00:40:16,740
Right, perfect timing.

896
00:40:17,300 --> 00:40:19,500
I found that cow for you.

897
00:40:19,900 --> 00:40:20,900
Strong and well-built.

898
00:40:20,960 --> 00:40:21,940
Top of the cattle world.

899
00:40:23,980 --> 00:40:25,500
This cow looks quite handsome.

900
00:40:26,700 --> 00:40:27,500
Does it poo?

901
00:40:27,700 --> 00:40:28,380
It does not.

902
00:40:29,860 --> 00:40:31,820
Good. Send it to the client
and let them confirm.

903
00:40:31,820 --> 00:40:32,420
All right.

904
00:40:33,580 --> 00:40:35,800
You have time to worry about
your father-in-law,

905
00:40:35,800 --> 00:40:37,510
you might as well
care about me a little.

906
00:40:37,540 --> 00:40:39,180
When you called me yesterday,

907
00:40:39,180 --> 00:40:40,780
I happened to be with Mr Hu.

908
00:40:42,180 --> 00:40:43,600
"I had not eaten anything.

909
00:40:43,600 --> 00:40:45,010
A friend saw how pitiful I looked,

910
00:40:45,010 --> 00:40:46,320
so he treated me to chicken soup."

911
00:40:46,460 --> 00:40:47,620
You are disgusting.

912
00:40:48,260 --> 00:40:51,000
I am in a critical phase
of my project now,

913
00:40:51,000 --> 00:40:52,320
so stop calling me randomly.

914
00:40:52,320 --> 00:40:53,100
You throw off my rhythm.

915
00:40:53,100 --> 00:40:54,510
You are someone who forgets friends
the moment you see a man.

916
00:40:54,510 --> 00:40:55,840
You actually talk about rhythm now.

917
00:40:56,340 --> 00:40:58,220
When Mr. Hu bought me
chicken soup yesterday,

918
00:40:58,460 --> 00:41:00,580
I praised him non stop,

919
00:41:00,580 --> 00:41:02,090
saying he was one of a kind,

920
00:41:02,090 --> 00:41:03,060
and no one else compared.

921
00:41:03,060 --> 00:41:04,140
It was all positive energy.

922
00:41:04,410 --> 00:41:05,460
I am certain of one thing,

923
00:41:05,460 --> 00:41:07,220
even if Hu Gang
cooked himself into a pot,

924
00:41:07,220 --> 00:41:08,950
Feng Meiqi would not
say a single nice word.

925
00:41:09,980 --> 00:41:11,270
She is still at home right now,

926
00:41:11,270 --> 00:41:12,840
waiting for Hu Gang to come back to her.

927
00:41:13,060 --> 00:41:14,580
How am I supposed to tell her anything?

928
00:41:15,160 --> 00:41:17,500
If you do not know how to say it,
then do not say anything.

929
00:41:17,500 --> 00:41:19,220
I already have everything under control.

930
00:41:19,660 --> 00:41:20,700
You are that confident?

931
00:41:21,980 --> 00:41:24,500
Listen, Feng Meiqi is like a book
full of wrong answers.

932
00:41:24,500 --> 00:41:27,010
She relies on being rich and pretty,
and she scribbles however she likes.

933
00:41:27,020 --> 00:41:27,660
Luckily,

934
00:41:27,660 --> 00:41:29,060
I have corrected everything now.

935
00:41:29,420 --> 00:41:30,900
So tell me, what can she do?

936
00:41:33,100 --> 00:41:34,060
I only have one request.

937
00:41:34,380 --> 00:41:35,020
Say it.

938
00:41:35,030 --> 00:41:36,520
Do not tell anyone we know each other.

939
00:41:36,780 --> 00:41:38,440
How could we not know each other?

940
00:41:38,440 --> 00:41:40,490
We do not just know each other,
we are close friends.

941
00:41:40,500 --> 00:41:42,470
You even showed me
Feng Meiqi's wrong answer book,

942
00:41:42,480 --> 00:41:43,880
and we went through it page by page.

943
00:41:45,140 --> 00:41:46,660
You might as well push me off a cliff.

944
00:41:47,680 --> 00:41:48,660
Look at the two of them.

945
00:41:48,670 --> 00:41:50,450
Do they not look exactly
like me and Hu Gang?

946
00:42:03,640 --> 00:42:05,570
You did not need to bring anything
when you came.

947
00:42:05,580 --> 00:42:07,740
Why did you bring gifts?

948
00:42:08,020 --> 00:42:09,380
It is nothing really.

949
00:42:10,140 --> 00:42:11,500
Honestly.

950
00:42:11,620 --> 00:42:12,900
How is your recovery going now?

951
00:42:13,700 --> 00:42:15,060
It is fine most of the time,

952
00:42:15,260 --> 00:42:17,580
but it still aches
around the wound sometimes.

953
00:42:17,780 --> 00:42:19,020
You still need to be careful.

954
00:42:19,900 --> 00:42:20,710
I will.

955
00:42:25,420 --> 00:42:26,900
Zhidong is getting married.

956
00:42:28,020 --> 00:42:29,860
And I have fallen sick again.

957
00:42:31,020 --> 00:42:35,260
Money has been very tight lately.

958
00:42:35,260 --> 00:42:37,110
What do you think, brother?

959
00:42:37,780 --> 00:42:39,890
I was wondering if I could

960
00:42:40,740 --> 00:42:42,710
