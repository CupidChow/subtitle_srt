(Adapted from iceread.com novel
"You Xi" by Qingyang Wanxi)

00:01:14,980 --> 00:01:17,980
=Episode 24=

4
00:01:18,220 --> 00:01:18,940
Shen Minghui,

5
00:01:18,940 --> 00:01:20,340
are you pretending you don't see me?

6
00:01:22,540 --> 00:01:23,660
Hello, Ni.

7
00:01:25,060 --> 00:01:26,460
Shen Minghui, I'm warning you.

8
00:01:26,460 --> 00:01:28,060
If you give Mr. Hu any more trouble,

9
00:01:28,060 --> 00:01:29,140
I'll tell your sister.

10
00:01:29,140 --> 00:01:30,280
And she's pregnant, remember?

11
00:01:30,460 --> 00:01:31,180
Ni,

12
00:01:31,580 --> 00:01:32,900
whose side are you on?

13
00:01:34,060 --> 00:01:35,420
Who is Mr. Hu to you?

14
00:01:37,580 --> 00:01:39,340
He's my life coach.

15
00:01:39,780 --> 00:01:42,460
My entire life plan is his to design.

16
00:01:45,700 --> 00:01:47,140
Mr. Hu, is that okay?

17
00:01:49,540 --> 00:01:52,100
I'm just worried
that I might not do a good job.

18
00:01:52,220 --> 00:01:52,940
There's no rush.

19
00:01:53,300 --> 00:01:54,540
You can draw once you're ready.

20
00:01:54,960 --> 00:01:56,440
Make every one of your strokes radiate.

21
00:01:56,450 --> 00:01:58,360
You guys can have
a baby together all you like.

22
00:01:58,370 --> 00:01:59,850
Just don't give him
the same name as mine.

23
00:02:05,460 --> 00:02:06,260
Here, Mr. Hu.

24
00:02:06,260 --> 00:02:07,100
Eat up.

25
00:02:08,100 --> 00:02:09,060
You too.

26
00:02:09,540 --> 00:02:10,860
The pork ribs are delicious.

27
00:02:13,180 --> 00:02:13,860
Mr. Pan?

28
00:02:14,700 --> 00:02:15,380
Mr. Pan!

29
00:02:17,660 --> 00:02:18,380
Mr. Hu?

30
00:02:18,860 --> 00:02:19,620
What is it?

31
00:02:19,620 --> 00:02:20,950
I have something to discuss with you.

32
00:02:21,060 --> 00:02:21,660
Go ahead.

33
00:02:22,760 --> 00:02:25,300
Shen Minghui, a student in my class,
only distributed the answers

34
00:02:25,300 --> 00:02:27,380
because he thought it was fun.

35
00:02:27,460 --> 00:02:29,460
And, he was sincere in
acknowledging his mistake.

36
00:02:29,780 --> 00:02:30,420
You see...

37
00:02:31,580 --> 00:02:33,620
Can we rescind the disciplinary action

38
00:02:34,060 --> 00:02:35,420
and give him a chance?

39
00:02:37,820 --> 00:02:38,740
You think he's a kid?

40
00:02:40,900 --> 00:02:41,740
Mr. Hu,

41
00:02:42,380 --> 00:02:43,860
do you know how long Shen Minghui

42
00:02:43,860 --> 00:02:46,260
has been studying in our school?

43
00:02:46,500 --> 00:02:48,100
He's in his fifth year here.

44
00:02:48,900 --> 00:02:51,100
Listen, when it comes
to selling pork chops,

45
00:02:51,100 --> 00:02:52,900
he's better at doing accounts than you.

46
00:02:53,940 --> 00:02:55,860
Tell him to study hard.

47
00:02:56,100 --> 00:02:58,900
Otherwise, it won't be as simple
as a disciplinary action.

48
00:03:06,980 --> 00:03:07,700
Shen Minghui.

49
00:03:08,940 --> 00:03:09,700
Mr. Hu,

50
00:03:10,100 --> 00:03:11,460
please relay a message to Mr. Pan.

51
00:03:11,820 --> 00:03:13,100
Tell him to focus on his work.

52
00:03:13,540 --> 00:03:16,540
Tell him not to flaunt his superiority
or take bribes.

53
00:03:16,740 --> 00:03:17,660
Otherwise,

54
00:03:17,660 --> 00:03:19,820
it won't be as simple
as quitting his job.

55
00:03:21,100 --> 00:03:22,140
He'll be sent to prison.

56
00:03:22,860 --> 00:03:23,900
You brat!

57
00:03:36,780 --> 00:03:38,900
(Regarding the disciplinary action
that will be taken on Shen Minghui,)

58
00:03:38,900 --> 00:03:40,660
(of Class 2 Senior 3, he shall be
given a major demerit.)

59
00:03:51,260 --> 00:03:51,820
Lu Bing.

60
00:03:53,660 --> 00:03:54,260
Come on.

61
00:03:54,860 --> 00:03:55,740
I'll send you home.

62
00:03:58,100 --> 00:03:59,300
(Xin City Grand Court)

63
00:03:59,300 --> 00:03:59,900
Mingzhu.

64
00:04:00,540 --> 00:04:01,620
Recently,

65
00:04:02,300 --> 00:04:04,860
I think I've been getting
more and more thick-skinned.

66
00:04:05,380 --> 00:04:06,620
You see, there's one thing.

67
00:04:07,780 --> 00:04:09,650
I've inquired about it
from everyone around us.

68
00:04:09,660 --> 00:04:11,180
I truly have no choice.

69
00:04:11,780 --> 00:04:12,780
What is it?

70
00:04:14,080 --> 00:04:15,320
It's about your brother-in-law.

71
00:04:15,580 --> 00:04:16,460
Zhang Hao, my husband,

72
00:04:16,470 --> 00:04:18,850
participated in a competitive selection
in his workplace lately.

73
00:04:19,140 --> 00:04:21,380
He almost reached the finals.

74
00:04:21,860 --> 00:04:23,020
I was thinking

75
00:04:23,760 --> 00:04:25,820
that since your father-in-law
is very resourceful,

76
00:04:26,140 --> 00:04:29,420
I was wondering if you can ask him
to help my husband out.

77
00:04:31,300 --> 00:04:33,980
Sure. I'll head back and ask him later.

78
00:04:34,160 --> 00:04:36,060
But I cannot guarantee
that he'll help you out.

79
00:04:36,080 --> 00:04:37,660
That's fine.
Just asking him is good enough.

80
00:04:37,660 --> 00:04:38,500
Just asking him is enough.

81
00:04:38,500 --> 00:04:39,980
Please don't put yourself on the spot!

82
00:04:45,160 --> 00:04:46,380
This is for your father-in-law.

83
00:04:46,980 --> 00:04:48,140
It's no need.

84
00:04:48,140 --> 00:04:50,140
I couldn't ask you for a favor
here empty-handed.

85
00:04:50,460 --> 00:04:51,060
Take it.

86
00:04:52,100 --> 00:04:52,900
Thank you.

87
00:04:53,620 --> 00:04:54,380
Thank you so much.

88
00:05:14,960 --> 00:05:16,840
You're getting another
disciplinary action, huh?

89
00:05:22,180 --> 00:05:23,340
You'll infuriate me to death.

90
00:05:24,340 --> 00:05:25,380
I'll die from anger

91
00:05:25,740 --> 00:05:27,020
before I die from overexertion.

92
00:05:29,220 --> 00:05:30,340
Eat up. It's piping hot.

93
00:05:39,580 --> 00:05:41,220
Is Dad working overtime today as well?

94
00:05:41,980 --> 00:05:43,620
It's been a few days since he came back.

95
00:05:43,620 --> 00:05:45,060
I'm sure he's exhausted.

96
00:05:45,340 --> 00:05:46,420
He's super busy, huh?

97
00:05:47,020 --> 00:05:48,740
It's difficult to make a living,
you know?

98
00:05:48,760 --> 00:05:50,220
He has to keep his eyes
on the goods he distributed.

99
00:05:50,220 --> 00:05:52,140
If not, it'll cause
a lot of issues later on.

100
00:06:00,180 --> 00:06:01,020
I'm done eating.

101
00:06:01,020 --> 00:06:02,260
You guys can enjoy yourselves.

102
00:07:01,700 --> 00:07:03,020
Who are you looking for?

103
00:07:04,100 --> 00:07:05,340
Hello. I'm looking for Mr. Feng.

104
00:07:05,780 --> 00:07:06,820
I'm his daughter-in-law.

105
00:07:08,960 --> 00:07:10,620
Mr. Feng's office is on the third floor.

106
00:07:10,860 --> 00:07:11,980
Come, I'll bring you there.

107
00:07:11,980 --> 00:07:13,540
It's fine. I've been there before.

108
00:07:14,180 --> 00:07:15,980
Aren't you guys rushing out goods today?

109
00:07:16,620 --> 00:07:17,420
Nope.

110
00:07:18,220 --> 00:07:19,060
Alright. Thank you.

111
00:07:19,060 --> 00:07:19,580
Okay.

112
00:07:20,020 --> 00:07:20,620
Take care.

113
00:07:24,100 --> 00:07:24,740
Feng.

114
00:07:26,480 --> 00:07:28,500
You've got quite a bit of money
in your account.

115
00:07:29,980 --> 00:07:31,980
You see, we're in a tough spot now.

116
00:07:34,100 --> 00:07:35,320
You have to come up with a way

117
00:07:35,700 --> 00:07:38,460
to patch this hole up
as soon as possible.

118
00:07:42,460 --> 00:07:43,140
Mingzhu?

119
00:07:44,100 --> 00:07:44,700
Dad.

120
00:07:44,960 --> 00:07:47,180
Sorry about that. I didn't know
that you guys were in a discussion.

121
00:07:47,180 --> 00:07:47,740
Do you need anything?

122
00:07:47,740 --> 00:07:48,860
You guys can go ahead.

123
00:07:48,860 --> 00:07:49,540
I can come back next time.

124
00:07:49,540 --> 00:07:50,620
It's fine.

125
00:07:50,620 --> 00:07:51,480
Let me introduce her.

126
00:07:51,580 --> 00:07:52,140
Come.

127
00:07:53,260 --> 00:07:54,220
This is my daughter-in-law.

128
00:07:54,660 --> 00:07:55,580
This is Mr. Wang.

129
00:07:55,860 --> 00:07:56,820
Hello, Mr. Wang.

130
00:07:56,820 --> 00:07:58,140
So, you're Mingzhu.

131
00:07:59,580 --> 00:08:02,460
Your father-in-law praised you a lot.

132
00:08:02,660 --> 00:08:04,620
He said you were capable and sensible.

133
00:08:05,420 --> 00:08:07,420
He has nothing but praise for you.

134
00:08:08,060 --> 00:08:10,240
I'm not as good
as my father-in-law had described me.

135
00:08:10,300 --> 00:08:11,100
What's good is good.

136
00:08:11,100 --> 00:08:12,460
Nothing can stop you from shining.

137
00:08:13,620 --> 00:08:16,140
Feng, it seems you guys
have a family matter to discuss.

138
00:08:17,140 --> 00:08:18,060
That's very important.

139
00:08:18,540 --> 00:08:20,060
We can discuss our matters next time.

140
00:08:20,060 --> 00:08:20,740
Okay. Sorry about that.

141
00:08:20,740 --> 00:08:21,920
- We'll talk about it next time.
- I'll head there first.

142
00:08:21,940 --> 00:08:23,380
Okay. Please go ahead.

143
00:08:23,560 --> 00:08:25,360
- You guys can go ahead.
- Sorry about that.

144
00:08:27,700 --> 00:08:28,020
Come.

145
00:08:28,980 --> 00:08:29,460
Have a seat.

146
00:08:30,060 --> 00:08:30,620
Okay.

147
00:08:37,780 --> 00:08:39,060
This is quite the sudden affair.

148
00:08:39,620 --> 00:08:42,980
I came to look for you at the company
because I didn't want Mom to find out.

149
00:08:42,980 --> 00:08:44,180
Yeah, don't let her know.

150
00:08:44,980 --> 00:08:45,660
If not,

151
00:08:45,660 --> 00:08:47,220
she'll nag us to no end.

152
00:08:50,360 --> 00:08:51,780
Regarding the company you mentioned,

153
00:08:51,780 --> 00:08:53,240
actually, it's still within my reach.

154
00:08:53,900 --> 00:08:54,900
If I can do it,

155
00:08:54,900 --> 00:08:55,980
I'll surely do it for you.

156
00:08:56,660 --> 00:08:57,820
We're a family, you know?

157
00:08:57,980 --> 00:08:58,860
You didn't have to.

158
00:09:01,500 --> 00:09:02,140
What about this?

159
00:09:02,740 --> 00:09:04,260
You should send these to your father.

160
00:09:04,620 --> 00:09:06,460
Your father delivers food
to you all day long.

161
00:09:06,460 --> 00:09:07,530
It must've been tough on him too.

162
00:09:07,540 --> 00:09:08,820
Dad, that's a different thing.

163
00:09:08,820 --> 00:09:11,460
I have to do something in return
when I'm asking you for a favor.

164
00:09:11,980 --> 00:09:14,100
But Dad, please don't be stressed out.

165
00:09:14,380 --> 00:09:16,380
It's fine even if it doesn't work out.

166
00:09:16,580 --> 00:09:18,300
I'll explain it to my sister later.

167
00:09:18,300 --> 00:09:19,500
They will understand.

168
00:09:21,340 --> 00:09:22,300
I can do it.

169
00:09:24,860 --> 00:09:25,660
Mingzhu,

170
00:09:25,860 --> 00:09:27,500
you're truly a sensible child.

171
00:09:31,460 --> 00:09:33,300
(Golden Abundance)
This is truly extravagant.

172
00:09:33,940 --> 00:09:35,460
The price is indeed steep.

173
00:09:35,700 --> 00:09:37,060
Let's look at the list.

174
00:09:37,500 --> 00:09:40,260
A bride attendant and a groom attendant?

175
00:09:40,260 --> 00:09:41,700
Why do we even need attendants?

176
00:09:41,700 --> 00:09:43,420
They're personal attendants.

177
00:09:43,420 --> 00:09:46,120
They handle the groom's
and bride's attire,

178
00:09:46,120 --> 00:09:47,680
hair accessories, and so on personally.

179
00:09:47,820 --> 00:09:48,700
They're also in charge

180
00:09:48,700 --> 00:09:50,620
of emotional management
for the couple and their parents.

181
00:09:50,620 --> 00:09:52,540
Emotional values are important,
you know?

182
00:09:52,700 --> 00:09:53,660
Here, have some water.

183
00:09:53,660 --> 00:09:54,720
- Thank you, Mingzhu.
- Thank you, Mingzhu.

184
00:09:57,060 --> 00:09:58,580
You guys can take a look at this.

185
00:09:59,060 --> 00:10:00,500
This Through Thick and Thin Set

186
00:10:00,700 --> 00:10:01,820
has everything you need.

187
00:10:02,260 --> 00:10:03,700
It doesn't have anything unnecessary.

188
00:10:03,710 --> 00:10:04,700
You can treat your friends and family

189
00:10:04,700 --> 00:10:06,660
to something better
with the money you've saved.

190
00:10:06,660 --> 00:10:07,540
It's more practical.

191
00:10:07,540 --> 00:10:08,620
Mingzhu is right.

192
00:10:08,620 --> 00:10:10,770
The food that goes into our bellies
is what truly counts.

193
00:10:10,780 --> 00:10:11,660
You're such a glutton.

194
00:10:14,540 --> 00:10:16,340
(Love Stronger Than Gold)
Mingzhu, isn't this set cheaper?

195
00:10:16,620 --> 00:10:17,980
As for this set,

196
00:10:18,220 --> 00:10:19,460
I don't really recommend it.

197
00:10:19,620 --> 00:10:21,540
Actually, it doesn't offer
any wedding packages.

198
00:10:21,540 --> 00:10:22,700
They just hang a big red curtain

199
00:10:22,700 --> 00:10:23,700
with the character "bliss" on it

200
00:10:23,700 --> 00:10:24,900
to curate a festive mood.

201
00:10:25,260 --> 00:10:26,380
If so, it should be called

202
00:10:26,540 --> 00:10:27,740
Love Weaker Than Gold.

203
00:10:28,780 --> 00:10:30,380
Understood. It's just a meal, right?

204
00:10:30,660 --> 00:10:31,460
It's just a banquet.

205
00:10:31,470 --> 00:10:33,750
It's just a comparison tool
for the bottom-tier sets, huh?

206
00:10:34,260 --> 00:10:35,080
We usually recommend

207
00:10:35,080 --> 00:10:37,260
the Through Thick and Thin Set
to our own family members.

208
00:10:37,260 --> 00:10:40,100
It represents
a steady marriage and life.

209
00:10:41,460 --> 00:10:42,540
Thank you, Mingzhu.

210
00:10:42,540 --> 00:10:43,140
Mingzhu!

211
00:10:43,460 --> 00:10:44,460
Sorry that I'm late.

212
00:10:44,460 --> 00:10:45,300
Let me introduce her.

213
00:10:45,300 --> 00:10:46,140
This is Ni.

214
00:10:46,240 --> 00:10:47,260
That's Zhidong and Bichen.

215
00:10:47,540 --> 00:10:48,300
We met before.

216
00:10:50,180 --> 00:10:50,940
Hello.

217
00:10:50,940 --> 00:10:52,340
Nice to meet you.

218
00:10:52,340 --> 00:10:53,100
Likewise.

219
00:10:53,100 --> 00:10:54,850
It's only nice
when everyone is doing well.

220
00:10:54,860 --> 00:10:55,700
Where are we?

221
00:10:57,020 --> 00:10:57,380
This one.

222
00:10:57,920 --> 00:10:59,960
What do you guys think about
the Through Thick and Thin Set?

223
00:11:00,220 --> 00:11:01,380
It's great.

224
00:11:01,980 --> 00:11:03,140
I just confessed to Hu Gang.

225
00:11:04,140 --> 00:11:04,780
What did he say?

226
00:11:04,900 --> 00:11:05,980
He was elated.

227
00:11:05,980 --> 00:11:07,620
He was deeply engrossed.

228
00:11:08,940 --> 00:11:10,580
Let me introduce the set to you.

229
00:11:10,860 --> 00:11:12,420
The Through Thick and Thin Set

230
00:11:12,420 --> 00:11:14,340
is our company's signature package.

231
00:11:14,410 --> 00:11:16,380
It's affordable,
and comes in generous portions.

232
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:19,300
It does have a lot of varieties.

233
00:11:19,540 --> 00:11:20,220
Miss Ni,

234
00:11:20,740 --> 00:11:23,100
I suppose your company is quite large.

235
00:11:24,580 --> 00:11:25,380
Indeed.

236
00:11:25,740 --> 00:11:26,900
We provide complete services,

237
00:11:26,900 --> 00:11:28,170
and the division of our labor
is well-balanced.

238
00:11:28,180 --> 00:11:31,580
From planning, to financial planning,
to executing, and to overseeing,

239
00:11:31,760 --> 00:11:32,700
I do all of that alone.

240
00:11:33,340 --> 00:11:34,420
That's amazing.

241
00:11:34,460 --> 00:11:36,620
I have a part-timer as well,
which is Miss Shen Mingzhu.

242
00:11:37,630 --> 00:11:39,260
I have no choice.
Workforce is expensive nowadays.

243
00:11:39,260 --> 00:11:40,220
I can't afford to hire people.

244
00:11:40,220 --> 00:11:42,260
Usually, we establish
a corporate partnership with others

245
00:11:42,260 --> 00:11:43,540
after receiving an order.

246
00:11:45,120 --> 00:11:45,940
Are you a contractor?

247
00:11:47,740 --> 00:11:49,340
You can think of it that way.

248
00:11:49,340 --> 00:11:50,900
But in our industry,

249
00:11:50,900 --> 00:11:52,380
it's called...

250
00:11:52,740 --> 00:11:53,580
An operation.

251
00:11:53,580 --> 00:11:54,340
That's right.

252
00:11:54,340 --> 00:11:56,140
And, since we're friends,

253
00:11:56,140 --> 00:11:56,860
I'll let you in on a secret.

254
00:11:56,860 --> 00:11:58,680
You guys can save money
on this part as well.

255
00:11:58,680 --> 00:12:00,420
It's currently
the peak season for weddings.

256
00:12:00,420 --> 00:12:02,020
Hiring a wedding host
will be very costly.

257
00:12:02,020 --> 00:12:03,900
Therefore,
it's highly advised for you guys

258
00:12:03,900 --> 00:12:05,500
to bring your own
wedding host friend to the wedding.

259
00:12:05,500 --> 00:12:08,050
It'll be easier to communicate
what you want with them as well.

260
00:12:08,180 --> 00:12:10,060
We had a job before this.

261
00:12:10,060 --> 00:12:11,780
They hired their ex-coursemate

262
00:12:11,780 --> 00:12:12,820
to host their wedding.

263
00:12:13,020 --> 00:12:14,020
The wedding

264
00:12:14,020 --> 00:12:15,500
was just like a nostalgia party.

265
00:12:15,500 --> 00:12:16,460
It was so touching.

266
00:12:17,580 --> 00:12:18,820
Among the people we know,

267
00:12:18,820 --> 00:12:20,740
I suppose my sister
is the most eloquent one.

268
00:12:20,860 --> 00:12:22,260
Why don't we ask your sister, then?

269
00:12:23,500 --> 00:12:25,380
She's pregnant. How can she go on stage?

270
00:12:26,120 --> 00:12:27,580
I don't know a lot of people either.

271
00:12:29,260 --> 00:12:30,620
We don't have many friends, do we?

272
00:12:31,940 --> 00:12:33,020
I'm reminded of one person.

273
00:12:33,020 --> 00:12:33,780
Who?

274
00:12:33,780 --> 00:12:34,860
Dr. Li.

275
00:12:34,960 --> 00:12:37,930
He was the one who hosted their school's
100th year anniversary celebration.

276
00:12:37,940 --> 00:12:39,860
He could both host and perform surgery.

277
00:12:40,540 --> 00:12:41,300
Perform surgery?

278
00:12:42,260 --> 00:12:43,020
A doctor?

279
00:12:43,360 --> 00:12:45,910
He is an obstetrician and gynecologist
at the People's Hospital.

280
00:12:45,980 --> 00:12:47,220
Do you remember last time?

281
00:12:47,460 --> 00:12:49,380
He didn't get to host
Uncle's birthday banquet.

282
00:12:49,380 --> 00:12:50,780
I think he was pretty disappointed.

283
00:12:51,380 --> 00:12:52,860
Great. We can ask him to come, then.

284
00:12:53,060 --> 00:12:53,700
Listen,

285
00:12:53,700 --> 00:12:55,620
it'll cost 5,000 yuan to hire
a top-tier emcee.

286
00:12:55,620 --> 00:12:56,780
But you can hire him for free.

287
00:12:57,100 --> 00:12:58,540
But this is my wedding.

288
00:12:59,180 --> 00:13:01,500
Yeah. Wouldn't this be strange?

289
00:13:02,700 --> 00:13:04,060
Are you guys dumb?

290
00:13:04,660 --> 00:13:06,500
He's an obstetrician-gynecologist.

291
00:13:06,860 --> 00:13:08,380
You guys will have a child soon.

292
00:13:08,380 --> 00:13:10,700
And, he's just the guy you need.

293
00:13:11,060 --> 00:13:12,340
You guys need to butter him up.

294
00:13:13,880 --> 00:13:14,900
Let's invite Dr. Li, then.

295
00:13:16,060 --> 00:13:17,140
Are we able to?

296
00:13:18,400 --> 00:13:19,020
What about this?

297
00:13:19,540 --> 00:13:21,180
Let's buy Dr. Li a meal first.

298
00:13:21,980 --> 00:13:23,300
And, we'll invite Zhixia as well.

299
00:13:24,020 --> 00:13:24,700
Someone's here.

300
00:13:25,260 --> 00:13:26,500
I threw up a lot.

301
00:13:26,500 --> 00:13:27,380
I think it's related to my age...

302
00:13:27,380 --> 00:13:27,980
Dr. Li.

303
00:13:28,500 --> 00:13:29,420
Dr. Li is here.

304
00:13:29,420 --> 00:13:29,780
Miss?

305
00:13:29,780 --> 00:13:30,860
Here, have a seat.

306
00:13:31,620 --> 00:13:32,460
Is soda water okay?

307
00:13:32,460 --> 00:13:33,340
Yeah.

308
00:13:35,500 --> 00:13:37,420
I rushed here after work.

309
00:13:37,420 --> 00:13:38,700
Mingzhu said you guys
had something to discuss.

310
00:13:38,700 --> 00:13:39,380
What is it?

311
00:13:39,380 --> 00:13:40,660
We do have something to discuss.

312
00:13:41,020 --> 00:13:41,740
It's important.

313
00:13:42,260 --> 00:13:43,260
It's her wedding.

314
00:13:44,580 --> 00:13:47,420
This is our future sister-in-law,

315
00:13:47,420 --> 00:13:48,020
Bichen.

316
00:13:48,220 --> 00:13:48,900
Hello, Dr. Li.

317
00:13:48,900 --> 00:13:49,860
Hello.

318
00:13:51,220 --> 00:13:52,100
We met before.

319
00:13:52,520 --> 00:13:54,340
What's wrong? Was she unable
to receive my consultation?

320
00:13:54,340 --> 00:13:56,050
Not at all. It's easy
to receive your consultation.

321
00:13:56,260 --> 00:13:58,500
Look at her.
She doesn't even let me brag.

322
00:13:58,500 --> 00:13:59,860
You may go ahead.

323
00:14:00,180 --> 00:14:01,180
It's like this.

324
00:14:01,940 --> 00:14:03,180
Bichen and my brother

325
00:14:03,180 --> 00:14:04,500
will get married soon.

326
00:14:04,500 --> 00:14:07,220
Therefore, we wish to invite you

327
00:14:07,500 --> 00:14:08,500
to hold down their fort.

328
00:14:08,660 --> 00:14:09,700
Hold down their fort?

329
00:14:09,980 --> 00:14:12,100
That is to host their wedding.

330
00:14:12,100 --> 00:14:12,860
Host their wedding?

331
00:14:13,320 --> 00:14:14,900
Aren't you the poster child
for the art stream?

332
00:14:14,900 --> 00:14:16,460
I was merely bragging.

333
00:14:16,460 --> 00:14:17,620
Didn't you host your school's

334
00:14:17,620 --> 00:14:18,540
100th year anniversary celebration?

335
00:14:18,540 --> 00:14:19,820
There were over 10 hosts there.

336
00:14:19,820 --> 00:14:20,940
I stood at the very edge.

337
00:14:20,940 --> 00:14:21,580
I can't do it.

338
00:14:22,180 --> 00:14:23,940
Dr. Li, please don't be modest.

339
00:14:23,940 --> 00:14:27,060
We've already seen your achievements
on the People's Hospital's website.

340
00:14:27,300 --> 00:14:28,180
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

341
00:14:28,180 --> 00:14:30,460
You've been hosting
their annual meeting every year.

342
00:14:30,760 --> 00:14:33,380
Dr. Li, I truly think Nanzhou has plenty of
talented individuals,

343
00:14:33,380 --> 00:14:35,100
just like you.

344
00:14:35,100 --> 00:14:35,740
Dr. Li.

345
00:14:36,540 --> 00:14:39,820
It's not an exaggeration to call you
the top dog at People's Hospital, right?

346
00:14:39,820 --> 00:14:41,220
Miss, that's over-exaggerating it.

347
00:14:42,740 --> 00:14:44,420
You guys are buying me a meal

348
00:14:44,420 --> 00:14:46,060
and buttering me up together.

349
00:14:46,280 --> 00:14:48,380
It's obvious
that I can't just refuse your request.

350
00:14:48,390 --> 00:14:49,860
If so, I suppose that's a yes, then.

351
00:14:51,020 --> 00:14:52,220
Thank you, Dr. Li.

352
00:14:53,060 --> 00:14:53,940
- Stop.
- Thank you.

353
00:14:53,940 --> 00:14:56,020
Dr. Li, you're truly multi-talented.

354
00:14:56,020 --> 00:14:57,540
You're both virtuous and talented.

355
00:14:57,700 --> 00:15:00,100
I'll say this first.

356
00:15:00,100 --> 00:15:02,170
It's just like a briefing I do
before any surgery.

357
00:15:02,420 --> 00:15:04,100
After all, I'm not a professional.

358
00:15:04,100 --> 00:15:06,380
You may encounter
the following situations.

359
00:15:06,380 --> 00:15:08,820
Firstly, I might forget the script
when I get too nervous.

360
00:15:08,820 --> 00:15:09,900
Therefore, at that moment,

361
00:15:10,140 --> 00:15:11,980
I need the mood-makers to help me out.

362
00:15:11,980 --> 00:15:12,580
I'll do it.

363
00:15:13,020 --> 00:15:15,620
Great. Secondly, I might go on for too long
when I get excited.

364
00:15:15,620 --> 00:15:16,380
Please forgive me for that.

365
00:15:16,380 --> 00:15:17,500
That's fine. I'll be around.

366
00:15:17,660 --> 00:15:18,860
Okay. Thirdly,

367
00:15:18,860 --> 00:15:20,580
if I accept any urgent calls

368
00:15:20,580 --> 00:15:21,940
from the ER,

369
00:15:21,940 --> 00:15:23,620
I'll stop the hosting immediately.

370
00:15:23,620 --> 00:15:24,740
You guys have to prepare a backup plan.

371
00:15:24,740 --> 00:15:25,460
Dr. Li,

372
00:15:25,820 --> 00:15:27,260
we're clear with

373
00:15:27,260 --> 00:15:28,820
every one of your situations.

374
00:15:29,820 --> 00:15:32,020
Should we sign a pre-hosting agreement?

375
00:15:32,020 --> 00:15:32,860
It's fine. No need for that.

376
00:15:32,860 --> 00:15:34,060
That'll be unnecessary.

377
00:15:34,060 --> 00:15:35,140
We can chat while we eat.

378
00:15:35,140 --> 00:15:35,660
Okay.

379
00:15:36,060 --> 00:15:36,700
Dr. Li.

380
00:15:36,700 --> 00:15:38,460
Here. Warm your belly with some soup.

381
00:15:38,460 --> 00:15:38,940
Okay. Thank you.

382
00:15:38,940 --> 00:15:40,780
- You've been busy the entire day.
- Okay.

383
00:15:40,980 --> 00:15:42,340
My bowl is already full.

384
00:15:42,580 --> 00:15:44,500
So, why did you guys

385
00:15:44,500 --> 00:15:45,700
want me to be the host?

386
00:15:45,700 --> 00:15:47,980
It's because Mingzhu
strongly recommended you.

387
00:15:48,260 --> 00:15:50,340
Although we're friends,

388
00:15:50,780 --> 00:15:52,660
I do have high respect for you.

389
00:15:52,980 --> 00:15:53,940
Do you still remember?

390
00:15:53,940 --> 00:15:55,140
When I had a cornual pregnancy,

391
00:15:55,140 --> 00:15:56,660
I was truly afraid back then.

392
00:15:56,660 --> 00:15:58,100
But you kept consoling me.

393
00:15:58,500 --> 00:15:59,700
Zhixia's mother did the same.

394
00:15:59,700 --> 00:16:02,180
You were the one who saved me
when I was bleeding profusely.

395
00:16:02,180 --> 00:16:02,900
I was just doing my duty.

396
00:16:02,900 --> 00:16:04,940
To us ordinary folks,

397
00:16:05,100 --> 00:16:07,500
doctors like you all are our guardians.

398
00:16:08,260 --> 00:16:09,340
I no longer have the chance.

399
00:16:09,580 --> 00:16:10,580
If I did have the chance,

400
00:16:10,580 --> 00:16:12,250
I would've liked for you
to host my wedding as well.

401
00:16:14,260 --> 00:16:15,980
The love journey
of Bichen and my brother

402
00:16:15,980 --> 00:16:17,420
was pretty difficult as well.

403
00:16:17,420 --> 00:16:19,100
Now, everything has settled down.

404
00:16:19,100 --> 00:16:21,700
Therefore, Dr. Li,
we hope that you can host their wedding.

405
00:16:21,700 --> 00:16:23,130
And our baby's 100th-day celebration.

406
00:16:23,140 --> 00:16:24,180
And their baby's
first birthday celebration.

407
00:16:24,180 --> 00:16:26,020
Why don't you host
the baby's wedding as well?

408
00:16:26,030 --> 00:16:27,100
I suppose I would be venerable

409
00:16:27,100 --> 00:16:28,340
and highly respected back then.

410
00:16:28,340 --> 00:16:29,980
By then, it'll be hard
to receive your consultation.

411
00:16:29,980 --> 00:16:31,720
Wait, do I still need
to work at that time?

412
00:16:31,780 --> 00:16:32,740
Come.

413
00:16:32,740 --> 00:16:34,660
Let's drink tea instead of liquor.

414
00:16:34,660 --> 00:16:35,180
Alright.

415
00:16:35,340 --> 00:16:38,140
To the well-respected
and venerable Dr. Li!

416
00:16:38,140 --> 00:16:38,660
Alright!

417
00:16:38,660 --> 00:16:40,460
May you do well in your career!

418
00:16:40,460 --> 00:16:41,960
Alright. I'll also do my best

419
00:16:41,960 --> 00:16:43,860
to give the newlywed couple
the perfect wedding.

420
00:16:43,860 --> 00:16:45,100
Thank you.

421
00:16:48,060 --> 00:16:49,900
I think this package is pretty good.

422
00:16:49,900 --> 00:16:51,220
(Bridal Package)
It has a complimentary luxury suite too.

423
00:16:51,500 --> 00:16:53,460
It's still too expensive.

424
00:16:56,980 --> 00:16:57,740
Miss Feng,

425
00:16:57,980 --> 00:17:00,220
can we get a discount?

426
00:17:01,230 --> 00:17:03,500
This package is already
the most thoughtful bridal package

427
00:17:03,500 --> 00:17:05,220
offered by our hotel.

428
00:17:05,480 --> 00:17:07,380
We also provide a lot of
complimentary packages.

429
00:17:07,380 --> 00:17:08,540
It's worth the experience.

430
00:17:09,820 --> 00:17:10,700
Give us a discount.

431
00:17:10,710 --> 00:17:12,480
We're hosting a banquet
for 200 people here.

432
00:17:14,060 --> 00:17:15,580
If so, I'll request the hotel

433
00:17:16,020 --> 00:17:17,100
to give you guys a bottle of

434
00:17:17,100 --> 00:17:19,060
complimentary French champagne
worth 888 yuan.

435
00:17:19,060 --> 00:17:19,660
How about it?

436
00:17:20,140 --> 00:17:20,980
What do you think?

437
00:17:21,820 --> 00:17:23,180
The champagne isn't worth it.

438
00:17:24,460 --> 00:17:26,300
Why don't you give us

439
00:17:26,300 --> 00:17:27,900
a 888-yuan discount directly?

440
00:17:28,940 --> 00:17:30,020
Mister, I'm sorry.

441
00:17:30,020 --> 00:17:31,420
That won't do.

442
00:17:31,420 --> 00:17:32,940
Why not?

443
00:17:32,940 --> 00:17:34,730
Just try to apply for it
with your superiors.

444
00:17:34,740 --> 00:17:35,700
Try asking them.

445
00:17:35,980 --> 00:17:38,020
My superiors have already
gotten off work.

446
00:17:38,020 --> 00:17:39,620
You guys are in the service industry.

447
00:17:39,620 --> 00:17:41,140
To think that you guys
have fixed working hours.

448
00:17:41,280 --> 00:17:43,550
Even a machine needs to recharge
their batteries, you know?

449
00:17:43,940 --> 00:17:45,100
What attitude is that?

450
00:17:45,900 --> 00:17:47,460
Is this how your hotel does business?

451
00:17:48,380 --> 00:17:50,140
You guys are belittling us just because

452
00:17:50,150 --> 00:17:52,250
we're inquiring about
the cheapest bridal package, huh?

453
00:17:53,500 --> 00:17:54,980
Dear, let's find another place.

454
00:17:55,220 --> 00:17:56,500
We won't do business with them.

455
00:17:56,780 --> 00:17:57,540
Let's go.

456
00:17:59,420 --> 00:18:00,140
Take the coffee.

457
00:18:03,820 --> 00:18:04,460
Meiqi.

458
00:18:05,420 --> 00:18:05,860
Wait.

459
00:18:07,260 --> 00:18:09,100
How is it? Did you clinch the deal?

460
00:18:10,140 --> 00:18:10,820
No, I didn't.

461
00:18:11,120 --> 00:18:12,320
They thought it was too expensive.

462
00:18:13,700 --> 00:18:15,660
You have to explain it to the clients.

463
00:18:15,660 --> 00:18:16,980
Our services are expensive for a reason.

464
00:18:16,980 --> 00:18:18,460
I've already explained
everything I needed to.

465
00:18:18,460 --> 00:18:20,040
They still thought it was too expensive.

466
00:18:21,340 --> 00:18:21,940
Meiqi,

467
00:18:22,860 --> 00:18:24,910
everyone knows
that you come from a well-off family.

468
00:18:25,100 --> 00:18:27,220
It's like you don't care
about your commission at all

469
00:18:27,320 --> 00:18:28,660
But I hope you'll understand this.

470
00:18:29,180 --> 00:18:32,420
You can only do a good job
if you care about the job.

471
00:18:35,340 --> 00:18:36,300
I heard that Nanxi Hotel

472
00:18:36,300 --> 00:18:38,100
has taken away
a lot of our business lately.

473
00:18:38,100 --> 00:18:40,260
I heard that the retro bridal banquet

474
00:18:40,900 --> 00:18:43,300
created by two of their female employees
was all the craze.

475
00:18:44,020 --> 00:18:44,660
Meiqi,

476
00:18:45,620 --> 00:18:47,740
you're an elite graduate
who came back from overseas.

477
00:18:48,450 --> 00:18:49,860
You should put more effort into it.

478
00:18:50,860 --> 00:18:52,340
If you don't hit this season's KPI,

479
00:18:53,340 --> 00:18:54,740
we'll get us in trouble.

480
00:18:59,900 --> 00:19:00,820
Your shrimp is ready.

481
00:19:00,820 --> 00:19:01,420
Please enjoy your meal.

482
00:19:01,420 --> 00:19:02,460
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

483
00:19:03,900 --> 00:19:04,500
Dr. Li,

484
00:19:04,820 --> 00:19:07,060
once we're done with Bichen's wedding,

485
00:19:07,060 --> 00:19:08,980
I'll do my best
to find you a girlfriend.

486
00:19:08,980 --> 00:19:09,620
No thanks.

487
00:19:09,620 --> 00:19:10,980
Were you single all this time?

488
00:19:11,380 --> 00:19:12,350
I once had a girlfriend.

489
00:19:12,820 --> 00:19:14,460
Dr. Li is a golden bachelor.

490
00:19:14,620 --> 00:19:15,780
I'm famous for being single.

491
00:19:15,980 --> 00:19:16,660
Don't worry.

492
00:19:16,980 --> 00:19:18,780
That'll change once I help him out.

493
00:19:19,160 --> 00:19:19,900
Miss, no need for that.

494
00:19:19,900 --> 00:19:21,580
I think I'm leading a carefree life

495
00:19:21,820 --> 00:19:22,900
as a single man.

496
00:19:22,900 --> 00:19:23,740
Once I marry someone,

497
00:19:23,740 --> 00:19:25,300
I'll gain a lot of new relatives.

498
00:19:25,640 --> 00:19:27,060
Life is already troublesome enough.

499
00:19:27,060 --> 00:19:28,940
If I do so, it'll only make
my life more troublesome.

500
00:19:28,940 --> 00:19:30,300
Everyone here is
a relative of one another.

501
00:19:30,300 --> 00:19:31,580
I'll ask you for a favor,
and you'll ask me for a favor.

502
00:19:31,580 --> 00:19:32,580
Isn't that fun?

503
00:19:33,780 --> 00:19:34,700
Don't take it for real.

504
00:19:34,700 --> 00:19:36,340
Zhixia was just joking with you.

505
00:19:36,580 --> 00:19:38,220
You can live however you want to live.

506
00:19:38,220 --> 00:19:38,820
Alright.

507
00:19:38,980 --> 00:19:40,580
Here, have some shrimp.

508
00:19:46,220 --> 00:19:46,980
What's the matter?

509
00:19:50,680 --> 00:19:52,380
This is the first time
someone has peeled my shrimp from me

510
00:19:52,380 --> 00:19:53,820
since I was a child.

511
00:20:22,340 --> 00:20:23,060
Meiqi.

512
00:20:23,580 --> 00:20:24,180
Mom?

513
00:20:24,580 --> 00:20:25,500
What's the matter?

514
00:20:26,500 --> 00:20:27,900
I was looking at you from above.

515
00:20:27,900 --> 00:20:29,220
You've been sitting here
for a while now.

516
00:20:29,220 --> 00:20:30,380
Why didn't you come upstairs?

517
00:20:32,020 --> 00:20:32,780
And,

518
00:20:33,220 --> 00:20:35,340
why didn't you drive to work today?

519
00:20:38,160 --> 00:20:40,100
I was quite tired.
I didn't feel like driving.

520
00:20:42,700 --> 00:20:44,540
Are you upset with something?

521
00:20:46,140 --> 00:20:48,180
That's not it. You see...

522
00:20:49,720 --> 00:20:52,500
The sales performance of our hotel's
current season isn't looking good.

523
00:20:52,980 --> 00:20:54,420
My boss gave me some pressure.

524
00:20:55,460 --> 00:20:57,420
But I thought I was
already working hard enough.

525
00:20:57,420 --> 00:20:59,250
I even worked overtime
to serve additional customers.

526
00:20:59,260 --> 00:21:00,140
Precisely.

527
00:21:00,260 --> 00:21:01,460
You came back very late.

528
00:21:02,340 --> 00:21:04,740
And, I couldn't hit my KPI

529
00:21:04,740 --> 00:21:06,940
because the people of Nanzhou
don't like to spend money.

530
00:21:07,260 --> 00:21:09,380
The couple I served today thought
our packages were expensive too.

531
00:21:09,380 --> 00:21:10,350
Bichen thought the same.

532
00:21:11,500 --> 00:21:14,160
It's impossible to communicate
when our perceptions are different.

533
00:21:16,100 --> 00:21:17,220
Silly girl,

534
00:21:17,220 --> 00:21:18,940
were you upset over this?

535
00:21:19,220 --> 00:21:21,180
I told you long ago.

536
00:21:21,180 --> 00:21:23,380
You could quit
if you're unhappy with your job.

537
00:21:23,380 --> 00:21:25,340
Our family doesn't
need your wage anyway.

538
00:21:25,980 --> 00:21:26,580
Mom.

539
00:21:27,500 --> 00:21:28,220
Meiqi?

540
00:21:28,220 --> 00:21:29,540
What are you guys doing here?

541
00:21:29,540 --> 00:21:30,100
Mingzhu,

542
00:21:30,100 --> 00:21:31,740
why did you come back this late?

543
00:21:31,740 --> 00:21:33,500
A friend of mine was pregnant too.

544
00:21:33,700 --> 00:21:35,780
I took her out to have a meal
with Dr. Li today.

545
00:21:35,780 --> 00:21:36,700
Dr. Li?

546
00:21:41,860 --> 00:21:42,540
Mingzhu,

547
00:21:43,140 --> 00:21:44,620
this is a reminder.

548
00:21:45,260 --> 00:21:47,940
You're pregnant with the grandchild of
the Feng family, you know?

549
00:21:49,620 --> 00:21:50,220
Mom.

550
00:21:51,140 --> 00:21:51,540
Mom,

551
00:21:52,040 --> 00:21:53,640
you're kicking a huge fuss over nothing.

552
00:21:53,660 --> 00:21:54,620
She just went out to socialize.

553
00:21:54,620 --> 00:21:56,650
It has nothing to do
with whose child she's pregnant with.

554
00:21:56,900 --> 00:21:58,140
What are you saying?

555
00:21:58,840 --> 00:22:00,860
We sent you to England
for your studies, you know?

556
00:22:00,860 --> 00:22:02,820
Were such twisted values
all you've learned over there?

557
00:22:02,820 --> 00:22:04,420
Mom, that's not it.

558
00:22:04,420 --> 00:22:06,780
Values aren't decided by
your preferences alone.

559
00:22:07,060 --> 00:22:09,020
Yes, I did go to England
to see the world.

560
00:22:09,020 --> 00:22:10,100
I did broaden my horizons.

561
00:22:10,100 --> 00:22:10,940
But in the end?

562
00:22:10,940 --> 00:22:13,040
I still had no choice
but to stay cooped up in Nanzhou.

563
00:22:13,060 --> 00:22:14,300
I had to work under pressure
even during overtime shifts.

564
00:22:14,300 --> 00:22:16,200
And, I might be making less money
than Hu Gang.

565
00:22:16,220 --> 00:22:18,140
Are you saying
that we're dragging you down?

566
00:22:20,420 --> 00:22:21,220
I didn't say that.

567
00:22:21,220 --> 00:22:22,340
If so, what were you implying, then?

568
00:22:22,340 --> 00:22:23,900
What's wrong with coming back?
Is it bad to come back?

569
00:22:23,900 --> 00:22:25,300
I think it's great.

570
00:22:25,740 --> 00:22:27,300
You have everything you need at home.

571
00:22:27,300 --> 00:22:29,220
And, we know Hu Gang inside out.

572
00:22:29,220 --> 00:22:30,620
He's a good potential partner for you.

573
00:22:30,620 --> 00:22:31,380
He's good for you in every way.

574
00:22:31,380 --> 00:22:32,860
Who said so? He's bad for me in every way!

575
00:22:32,860 --> 00:22:33,540
Meiqi,

576
00:22:33,780 --> 00:22:34,860
stop it.

577
00:22:35,780 --> 00:22:37,140
Mom has a point.

578
00:22:37,140 --> 00:22:38,700
Are you serious?

579
00:22:38,700 --> 00:22:39,660
I was speaking up for you.

580
00:22:39,660 --> 00:22:41,060
Can you have some spine for once?

581
00:22:41,060 --> 00:22:43,020
Don't you understand what Mom
was trying to imply?

582
00:22:43,020 --> 00:22:44,260
She even said I had twisted values.

583
00:22:44,260 --> 00:22:45,380
Who said her values weren't twisted?

584
00:22:45,380 --> 00:22:46,780
What did I say?

585
00:22:47,300 --> 00:22:48,660
What did you mean by that?

586
00:22:49,860 --> 00:22:51,180
Do you know what era we're living in?

587
00:22:51,180 --> 00:22:52,260
Women should be independent now.

588
00:22:52,260 --> 00:22:53,780
Don't delude yourself into thinking
that you can gain prestige through me.

589
00:22:53,780 --> 00:22:55,100
What are you saying?

590
00:22:55,100 --> 00:22:56,060
Feng Meiqi!

591
00:22:56,060 --> 00:22:56,860
Stop right there!

592
00:22:56,860 --> 00:22:57,420
Mom.

593
00:22:58,340 --> 00:22:59,620
That's how Meiqi is.

594
00:22:59,630 --> 00:23:00,740
A strong independent woman.

595
00:23:00,740 --> 00:23:01,860
Strong independent woman?

596
00:23:01,860 --> 00:23:03,580
She's just spoiled by her father.

597
00:23:05,060 --> 00:23:05,940
And you,

598
00:23:06,500 --> 00:23:08,900
you're pregnant now.

599
00:23:09,220 --> 00:23:11,380
You shouldn't
wear yourself out like that.

600
00:23:11,540 --> 00:23:12,620
But I feel fine.

601
00:23:13,660 --> 00:23:15,500
Since when did I tell the teacher
to send Tangtang to the hospital?

602
00:23:15,500 --> 00:23:15,980
What about you?

603
00:23:15,980 --> 00:23:17,420
Have you ever sent her
to the hospital before?

604
00:23:20,140 --> 00:23:21,020
Meiqi, you're back.

605
00:23:21,900 --> 00:23:22,460
Dad.

606
00:23:23,540 --> 00:23:25,500
I think Shen Mingzhu went overboard.

607
00:23:26,380 --> 00:23:27,340
What did she do again?

608
00:23:28,060 --> 00:23:29,500
She had dinner with Dr. Li just now.

609
00:23:29,880 --> 00:23:31,740
Mom said the same thing
after hearing about it.

610
00:23:31,740 --> 00:23:33,500
She told her
to mind her conduct and so on.

611
00:23:33,500 --> 00:23:35,020
I spoke up for her
out of kind intention.

612
00:23:35,020 --> 00:23:36,450
But she didn't appreciate it at all.

613
00:23:37,140 --> 00:23:38,460
Your mother mentioned it again?

614
00:23:39,900 --> 00:23:40,900
My goodness.

615
00:23:43,420 --> 00:23:44,060
Alright now.

616
00:23:45,020 --> 00:23:46,940
Mingzhu is a sensible girl.

617
00:23:47,240 --> 00:23:49,540
Perhaps she did so
to not hurt your mother's emotions.

618
00:23:49,540 --> 00:23:50,860
Even so, she can't just
disregard her principles

619
00:23:50,860 --> 00:23:52,100
because of that.

620
00:23:53,340 --> 00:23:54,780
Silly girl,

621
00:23:55,540 --> 00:23:56,980
this isn't the court.

622
00:23:56,980 --> 00:23:58,500
Principles aren't essential here.

623
00:23:59,860 --> 00:24:01,500
At home, we emphasize warmth.

624
00:24:01,500 --> 00:24:02,900
We emphasize our bond.

625
00:24:04,260 --> 00:24:06,300
When you encounter something
like this in the future,

626
00:24:06,300 --> 00:24:08,260
just bow down and accept it.

627
00:24:08,500 --> 00:24:10,260
Just turn a blind eye to it

628
00:24:10,260 --> 00:24:11,420
and let it pass.

629
00:24:13,220 --> 00:24:15,580
You should learn from Mingzhu.

630
00:24:17,340 --> 00:24:18,060
I cannot.

631
00:24:18,360 --> 00:24:19,460
And I will never learn this.

632
00:24:25,140 --> 00:24:29,100
(Nanzhou First People's Hospital)

633
00:24:32,180 --> 00:24:33,180
Waist circumference, 78.

634
00:24:33,440 --> 00:24:34,780
The baby's growth is encouraging.

635
00:24:37,700 --> 00:24:39,860
He kicks me in the belly every day.

636
00:24:40,100 --> 00:24:41,140
He's quite strong.

637
00:24:41,140 --> 00:24:43,220
Alright. We just need to wait for
the blood test report.

638
00:24:43,220 --> 00:24:44,580
Just hand this to your doctor.

639
00:24:44,580 --> 00:24:45,660
Alright. Thank you.

640
00:24:48,980 --> 00:24:49,500
Mom.

641
00:24:50,060 --> 00:24:50,820
Is everything done?

642
00:24:50,820 --> 00:24:51,660
Everything's fine.

643
00:24:52,020 --> 00:24:53,210
This is the blood test report.

644
00:24:53,980 --> 00:24:55,620
I'll hand it over to the doctor later.

645
00:24:57,060 --> 00:24:58,460
It's Dr. Li, huh?

646
00:24:59,260 --> 00:25:00,780
(Gynecological Clinic)

647
00:25:00,780 --> 00:25:02,740
What? That's pretty good.

648
00:25:02,940 --> 00:25:04,180
Walk slowly.

649
00:25:04,180 --> 00:25:05,380
I'm fine.

650
00:25:05,780 --> 00:25:06,620
Your father thought

651
00:25:06,620 --> 00:25:08,740
that you guys would be running out
of chili oil by now.

652
00:25:08,740 --> 00:25:09,700
This is for your father-in-law.

653
00:25:09,700 --> 00:25:10,700
What? That's so much.

654
00:25:10,700 --> 00:25:12,340
When will I be able to finish this?

655
00:25:12,340 --> 00:25:14,180
Just keep it in the fridge.
You can enjoy it slowly.

656
00:25:14,180 --> 00:25:15,220
It won't spoil.

657
00:25:15,860 --> 00:25:17,100
Don't leave it lying.

658
00:25:20,020 --> 00:25:21,340
It might spill. Let it stand.

659
00:25:21,340 --> 00:25:21,940
Okay, I'll let it stand.

660
00:25:21,940 --> 00:25:23,780
No. 45, Shen Mingzhu,

661
00:25:23,780 --> 00:25:25,420
please head to Consultation Room 8.

662
00:25:25,420 --> 00:25:26,140
It's my turn.

663
00:25:27,940 --> 00:25:29,020
Wait here.

664
00:25:29,860 --> 00:25:30,380
Dr. Li.

665
00:25:31,020 --> 00:25:31,710
Hello, Mrs. Shen.

666
00:25:32,060 --> 00:25:33,300
Mom, just sit down.

667
00:25:36,420 --> 00:25:37,340
Were you busy today?

668
00:25:37,340 --> 00:25:38,980
Yeah. I barely have time to take a sip.

669
00:25:39,180 --> 00:25:40,060
Let me see.

670
00:25:40,060 --> 00:25:40,460
Okay.

671
00:25:46,180 --> 00:25:47,080
Everything looks good.

672
00:25:47,940 --> 00:25:49,020
Get ready to be a mother.

673
00:25:50,020 --> 00:25:50,620
Okay.

674
00:25:50,980 --> 00:25:52,140
I need some vitamins.

675
00:25:52,140 --> 00:25:52,740
Okay.

676

Li Jingzhe.

677
00:26:13,300 --> 00:26:14,980
You'll pay with your life today!

678
00:26:15,340 --> 00:26:16,340
Calm down!

679
00:26:16,340 --> 00:26:17,220
- Someone else is here.
- Calm down?

680
00:26:17,220 --> 00:26:17,940
Enough.

681
00:26:17,940 --> 00:26:19,300
You want me to calm down? Do you know
how many times I've been here?

682
00:26:19,300 --> 00:26:20,380
Everyone will perish here

683
00:26:20,380 --> 00:26:21,500
unless you compensate me!

684
00:26:21,500 --> 00:26:22,020
I know that.

685
00:26:22,020 --> 00:26:23,580
Can you let the other patient
out of the room first?

686
00:26:23,580 --> 00:26:25,490
- There's a patient here. Let her out.
- Listen up!

687
00:26:25,500 --> 00:26:26,300
You want to let her out?

688
00:26:26,300 --> 00:26:27,060
No one is allowed to leave!

689
00:26:27,060 --> 00:26:29,060
Do you know why we're here
to look for you again?

Mingzhu!

691
00:26:29,940 --> 00:26:30,940
You just didn't manage
to scam me of my money.

692
00:26:30,940 --> 00:26:31,780
What scam?

693
00:26:31,780 --> 00:26:33,420
- Open the door!
- Don't hurt anyone!

694
00:26:33,420 --> 00:26:34,380
No one is allowed to leave!

695
00:26:34,380 --> 00:26:35,300
Who said she could leave?

696

No one is allowed to leave!

697

There's another patient in here!

698
00:26:38,300 --> 00:26:39,460
I don't care if someone else is in here!

699
00:26:39,460 --> 00:26:40,620
Let's make things clear today!

700
00:26:40,620 --> 00:26:41,660
Enough. What about this?

701
00:26:41,660 --> 00:26:42,860
There's another patient in here.

702
00:26:42,860 --> 00:26:44,540
Do you know why we're here
to look for you?

703
00:26:44,540 --> 00:26:45,660
You just didn't manage
to scam me of my money.

704
00:26:45,660 --> 00:26:46,780
What scam?

705
00:26:46,780 --> 00:26:47,700
Don't hurt anyone!

706
00:26:47,700 --> 00:26:49,340
Nurse!

707
00:26:49,340 --> 00:26:50,020
Over here!

708
00:26:50,020 --> 00:26:50,620
Hurry!

709
00:26:50,620 --> 00:26:52,020
- Call for help!
- Security!

710
00:26:52,020 --> 00:26:52,900
Call for security!

711
00:26:53,060 --> 00:26:54,060
Call the cops!

712
00:26:54,060 --> 00:26:55,260
Someone's causing a ruckus here!

713
00:26:55,260 --> 00:26:55,980
How long will you hide?

714
00:26:55,980 --> 00:26:57,660
Our child died

715
00:26:58,180 --> 00:26:59,340
because of you!

716
00:26:59,340 --> 00:27:00,660
- You failed to scam us!
- Your hospital...

717
00:27:00,660 --> 00:27:01,540
You just failed to scam us, right?

718
00:27:01,540 --> 00:27:02,380
What scam?

719
00:27:02,380 --> 00:27:04,980
Listen up! Your hospital
has to bear the responsibility!

720
00:27:05,740 --> 00:27:06,580
Don't hurt anyone!

721
00:27:09,260 --> 00:27:10,580
You guys have to
bear the responsibility!

722
00:27:10,580 --> 00:27:11,900
I told you already!
It wasn't a case of medical malpractice!

723
00:27:11,900 --> 00:27:13,220
Everything was stated clearly
on the medical report!

724
00:27:13,220 --> 00:27:15,020
What medical report?
We don't trust that!

725
00:27:16,700 --> 00:27:18,380
We don't trust the medical report!

726
00:27:19,300 --> 00:27:20,140
Did you know that?

727
00:27:20,140 --> 00:27:21,460
Dr. Li, duck!

728
00:27:27,820 --> 00:27:29,740
Open the door! If not,
I'll break the window!

729
00:27:29,740 --> 00:27:30,840
Get out of the way! I...

730
00:27:31,460 --> 00:27:32,140
Hurry!

731
00:27:32,680 --> 00:27:33,300
That's enough!

732
00:27:33,300 --> 00:27:34,560
Stop right there! Don't run!

733
00:27:35,820 --> 00:27:36,500
Mrs. Shen!

734
00:27:36,500 --> 00:27:37,740
How dare you bully my daughter?

735
00:27:37,740 --> 00:27:38,460
Mrs. Shen, you mustn't!

736
00:27:38,460 --> 00:27:39,780
Let me beat him to death!

737
00:27:40,020 --> 00:27:40,840
Don't take it away!

738
00:27:40,940 --> 00:27:41,660
You mustn't!

739
00:27:41,670 --> 00:27:43,060
- Mrs. Shen! Stop!
- Come back!

740
00:27:43,060 --> 00:27:43,780
Mom!

741
00:27:44,020 --> 00:27:45,980
You'll be locked up too
if you go overboard!

742
00:27:46,380 --> 00:27:47,340
Are you okay?

743
00:27:47,340 --> 00:27:48,140
I'm fine.

744
00:27:51,700 --> 00:27:52,980
Is that blood? Are you bleeding?

745
00:27:53,660 --> 00:27:54,660
It's not blood.

746
00:27:55,020 --> 00:27:55,860
It's chili oil.

747
00:27:56,020 --> 00:27:57,380
Mom, it's just chili oil.

748
00:27:58,540 --> 00:28:00,140
That was terrifying...

749
00:28:00,620 --> 00:28:01,420
My girl!

750
00:28:01,620 --> 00:28:02,540
Mom, I'm fine.

751
00:28:02,540 --> 00:28:04,180
You scared me!

752
00:28:04,180 --> 00:28:05,180
Everything's fine.

753
00:28:07,340 --> 00:28:09,660
Dr. Li, is there a surveillance camera
in your room?

754
00:28:10,060 --> 00:28:11,020
No, there isn't.

755
00:28:11,940 --> 00:28:12,620
I have one.

756
00:28:14,060 --> 00:28:15,360
I recorded the entire incident.

757
00:28:16,900 --> 00:28:18,460
I'll make some chilled black fungus.

758
00:28:19,620 --> 00:28:20,260
That's enough.

759
00:28:21,580 --> 00:28:23,980
I'll make four cold and four hot dishes.

760
00:28:25,460 --> 00:28:27,540
After that, I'll head to Shen's place

761
00:28:27,540 --> 00:28:29,180
and get two signature dishes of his.

762
00:28:29,180 --> 00:28:31,420
After that, I'll come back
and prepare two quick dishes.

763
00:28:31,580 --> 00:28:32,220
That's all.

764
00:28:34,460 --> 00:28:37,260
This is our son-in-law's first visit.

765
00:28:38,140 --> 00:28:39,540
We must prepare everything.

766
00:28:39,540 --> 00:28:40,340
But,

767
00:28:40,580 --> 00:28:42,700
we shouldn't be too passionate as well.
Understood?

768
00:28:43,660 --> 00:28:44,620
Hu Gang knows Ni Debao.

769
00:28:46,760 --> 00:28:48,020
How would they know each other?

770
00:28:48,660 --> 00:28:50,500
Hu Gang is Minghui's class teacher.

771
00:28:50,500 --> 00:28:52,200
When the school
wanted to see the parents,

772
00:28:52,200 --> 00:28:53,440
Minghui asked my father to go.

773
00:28:58,420 --> 00:29:01,100
No wonder Yue Xiu'e told her off.

774
00:29:01,100 --> 00:29:02,020
Great job.

775
00:29:02,540 --> 00:29:04,340
Ni Debao must be out of her mind.

776
00:29:04,350 --> 00:29:06,540
He went out of his way
to pretend to be someone else's father.

777
00:29:06,780 --> 00:29:08,060
He deserved to be told off.

778
00:29:08,940 --> 00:29:09,740
I managed to get

779
00:29:09,740 --> 00:29:11,740
Hu Gang's WeChat contact
all thanks to Ni Debao.

780
00:29:13,660 --> 00:29:14,300
Mom.

781
00:29:15,500 --> 00:29:16,500
Ni Debao's portrait

782
00:29:16,500 --> 00:29:18,060
is still hanging on our wall.

783
00:29:18,460 --> 00:29:20,460
Do you think Mr. Hu can
continue our relationship

784
00:29:20,660 --> 00:29:21,380
when he comes here

785
00:29:21,380 --> 00:29:22,980
and sees the portrait on the wall?

786
00:29:23,900 --> 00:29:25,100
Do you remember the six units?

787
00:29:28,940 --> 00:29:30,100
Yeah.

788
00:29:31,140 --> 00:29:33,380
And, I think my father
has to participate in this too.

789
00:29:33,380 --> 00:29:35,720
After all, it's a good thing
for both parents to be alive.

790
00:29:35,780 --> 00:29:36,620
Come.

791
00:29:36,620 --> 00:29:37,900
As the head of the family,

792
00:29:37,900 --> 00:29:40,020
let's offer Mr. Hu a toast.

793
00:29:40,030 --> 00:29:41,420
- Thank you, mister.
- To Mr. Hu. Here.

794
00:29:41,420 --> 00:29:42,260
Thank you, mister.

795
00:29:47,000 --> 00:29:48,180
Here. Don't stand on ceremony.

796
00:29:48,180 --> 00:29:48,940
Alright.

797
00:29:48,940 --> 00:29:50,820
It's been so long
since I had this beef dish.

798
00:29:51,660 --> 00:29:53,300
Mr. Hu.

799
00:29:53,300 --> 00:29:54,740
Here, have some sliced beef.

800
00:29:55,100 --> 00:29:55,540
Okay.

801
00:29:55,540 --> 00:29:56,300
It's delicious.

802
00:29:56,300 --> 00:29:57,020
Thank you, madam.

803
00:29:57,180 --> 00:29:58,060
Mr. Hu.

804
00:29:58,260 --> 00:29:59,500
Try this pork chop.

805
00:30:00,120 --> 00:30:01,580
I heard that you guys
couldn't get it in school

806
00:30:01,580 --> 00:30:02,700
even if you queued for it.

807
00:30:03,020 --> 00:30:03,620
That's right.

808
00:30:04,340 --> 00:30:05,140
Thank you, mister.

809
00:30:06,060 --> 00:30:09,980
Mr. Hu, I heard that both of your parents
were in the education industry.

810
00:30:10,360 --> 00:30:12,950
He comes from a family of educators.
They have students everywhere.

811
00:30:13,260 --> 00:30:15,340
Both of my parents are
High school teachers.

812
00:30:15,340 --> 00:30:17,020
My mother teaches languages

813
00:30:17,020 --> 00:30:18,540
while my father teaches Math.

814
00:30:19,250 --> 00:30:21,300
They're well-versed in both
science and art stream.

815
00:30:21,760 --> 00:30:23,950
Dad, don't you think
he's a great match for our family?

816
00:30:24,260 --> 00:30:25,020
Yeah.

817
00:30:25,160 --> 00:30:25,860
Just look at him.

818
00:30:28,500 --> 00:30:30,060
Like parents, like son indeed.

819
00:30:30,060 --> 00:30:31,180
You flatter me.

820
00:30:31,580 --> 00:30:32,820
You see, my parents are...

821
00:30:34,500 --> 00:30:35,340
Sorry about that.

822
00:30:35,660 --> 00:30:36,100
Go ahead.

823
00:30:39,100 --> 00:30:40,220
Hey, mind your words.

824
00:30:40,220 --> 00:30:42,300
Not everything is Mahjong, you know?

825
00:30:42,300 --> 00:30:43,500
But what I said was true.

826
00:30:43,500 --> 00:30:45,750
Shut up. How can you still speak
when your mouth is full?

827
00:30:46,510 --> 00:30:47,900
Sorry about that, mister and madam.

828
00:30:47,900 --> 00:30:48,860
I've already put it on silent mode.

829
00:30:48,860 --> 00:30:50,020
That's fine. Work is more important.

830
00:30:50,020 --> 00:30:50,900
Work is important.

831
00:30:51,940 --> 00:30:54,620
As I was saying,

832
00:30:54,940 --> 00:30:57,460
they're teaching at
Beiqiao High School.

833
00:30:57,700 --> 00:30:58,780
And, my father

834
00:30:58,780 --> 00:31:00,780
is teaching
the senior year classes as well.

835
00:31:00,860 --> 00:31:03,330
So, your entire family is born
to educate people for the NCEE.

836
00:31:03,340 --> 00:31:04,100
That's right.

837
00:31:04,900 --> 00:31:06,100
Mister, you might not know,

838
00:31:06,460 --> 00:31:08,740
but I have to be on my guard around them

839
00:31:08,740 --> 00:31:10,340
whenever I go home now.

840
00:31:10,360 --> 00:31:12,260
Over the past two years,
our Nanzhou High School

841
00:31:12,260 --> 00:31:13,620
has maintained a graduation rate

842
00:31:13,620 --> 00:31:15,660
comparable to that
of Beiqiao High School.

843
00:31:15,760 --> 00:31:17,020
We're competing with each other.

844
00:31:17,540 --> 00:31:19,300
Whenever I go home,

845
00:31:19,300 --> 00:31:21,540
my parents will inquire about
the average score

846
00:31:21,540 --> 00:31:23,140
for our school's mock exam.

847
00:31:24,820 --> 00:31:25,700
If so, Comrade Hu,

848
00:31:25,700 --> 00:31:26,580
did you tell them?

849
00:31:27,060 --> 00:31:28,300
Of course not.

850
00:31:28,300 --> 00:31:29,300
Over your dead body.

851
00:31:29,780 --> 00:31:30,460
Am I right?

852
00:31:33,100 --> 00:31:33,980
Here, Mr. Hu.

853
00:31:33,980 --> 00:31:34,780
Thank you, mister.

854
00:31:35,020 --> 00:31:35,940
Please help yourself.

855
00:31:36,300 --> 00:31:37,460
Mr. Hu is a cultured person,

856
00:31:37,460 --> 00:31:38,660
just like me.

857
00:31:51,180 --> 00:31:52,020
Mr. Hu,

858
00:31:52,260 --> 00:31:54,340
I don't know if Ni has introduced us

859
00:31:54,820 --> 00:31:55,980
to you before.

860
00:32:00,300 --> 00:32:01,140
My wife

861
00:32:02,260 --> 00:32:03,980
works at the Civil Affairs Bureau.

862
00:32:04,260 --> 00:32:06,380
She's hardworking and earnest.

863
00:32:07,060 --> 00:32:09,780
And, she's a great cook.

864
00:32:11,260 --> 00:32:12,380
She was also gorgeous

865
00:32:12,660 --> 00:32:13,460
when she was young.

866
00:32:14,580 --> 00:32:16,660
People call her
Blooming Flower of the Heritage City.

867
00:32:17,020 --> 00:32:18,660
I suppose I got myself the wrong spouse.

868
00:32:20,300 --> 00:32:22,860
As to why she got married to me,

869
00:32:23,150 --> 00:32:24,500
I suppose it's obvious enough.

870
00:32:25,360 --> 00:32:27,060
I learned how to
read pulses since young.

871
00:32:27,180 --> 00:32:28,980
The clinic opposite our house is mine.

872
00:32:30,460 --> 00:32:33,020
When you mention the name Debao
in Heritage City,

873
00:32:33,020 --> 00:32:34,300
everyone knows about it.

874
00:32:34,300 --> 00:32:35,340
Enough already.

875
00:32:35,340 --> 00:32:36,220
Stop bragging.

876
00:32:36,500 --> 00:32:36,900
Here.

877
00:32:36,900 --> 00:32:38,260
I'm not bragging here.

878
00:32:39,540 --> 00:32:41,860
Your family has students
all over the world

879
00:32:41,870 --> 00:32:44,120
while our family treats patients
from all over the world.

880
00:32:44,260 --> 00:32:45,100
That's enough.

881
00:32:45,300 --> 00:32:46,580
Mr. Hu, here.

882
00:32:46,580 --> 00:32:47,380
Let's have a drink.

883
00:32:47,380 --> 00:32:49,340
Let's welcome Mr. Hu.

884
00:32:49,340 --> 00:32:50,580
Thank you, mister and madam.

885
00:32:50,580 --> 00:32:52,380
Please visit us often in the future.

886
00:32:56,820 --> 00:32:57,580
Mr. Hu,

887
00:32:57,860 --> 00:32:58,540
look.

888
00:33:00,860 --> 00:33:02,580
That's the refraction of light.

889
00:33:03,740 --> 00:33:05,700
Look where my finger is pointing.

890
00:33:09,340 --> 00:33:11,340
(Ni's Clinic)
One-stop burial services?

891
00:33:12,300 --> 00:33:13,340
My father owns that.

892
00:33:17,380 --> 00:33:18,660
I suppose it's one-stop indeed.

893
00:33:20,380 --> 00:33:21,740
Did you see the portrait as well?

894
00:33:26,200 --> 00:33:28,100
Actually, my parents
were divorced long ago.

895
00:33:28,820 --> 00:33:30,660
They've been arguing from the start.

896
00:33:31,620 --> 00:33:32,820
Therefore, my father remarried.

897
00:33:33,220 --> 00:33:34,540
He lives opposite my house.

898
00:33:35,020 --> 00:33:36,980
I have a younger sister called Xiaoni.

899
00:33:38,320 --> 00:33:39,660
You have a younger sister as well?

900
00:33:40,540 --> 00:33:41,380
She's adorable.

901
00:33:41,500 --> 00:33:42,740
You'll meet her eventually.

902
00:33:44,460 --> 00:33:46,260
But my mother refused
to accept this outcome.

903
00:33:46,260 --> 00:33:47,780
Therefore, she hung
a black and white portrait

904
00:33:47,780 --> 00:33:48,860
of my father on the wall.

905
00:33:50,660 --> 00:33:51,380
You see,

906
00:33:51,700 --> 00:33:54,140
this is the true journey
of my "wonderful" life.

907
00:33:54,980 --> 00:33:56,980
Do you still dare
to explore it further with me?

908
00:34:03,340 --> 00:34:04,300
Initially,

909
00:34:05,620 --> 00:34:06,380
I didn't.

910
00:34:07,980 --> 00:34:08,820
However,

911
00:34:09,620 --> 00:34:11,060
after today's meal,

912
00:34:13,740 --> 00:34:15,020
I don't think that's a huge deal.

913
00:34:18,180 --> 00:34:19,020
You brat.

914
00:34:24,500 --> 00:34:27,220
If so, your uncle's acting
was pretty convincing.

915
00:34:28,620 --> 00:34:30,340
He's very prideful.
Don't expose him, okay?

916
00:34:33,660 --> 00:34:36,620
The bride's father will
hold his daughter's hand

917
00:34:36,620 --> 00:34:38,540
and walk toward the groom slowly.

918
00:34:38,820 --> 00:34:40,260
Groom, slow down.

919
00:34:40,420 --> 00:34:41,420
I know you're impatient,

920
00:34:41,420 --> 00:34:42,750
but you aren't going to work here.

921
00:34:44,020 --> 00:34:46,300
Walk toward each other slowly.

922
00:34:49,380 --> 00:34:50,740
Maintain your smile.

923
00:34:53,660 --> 00:34:54,860
The bride's father will

924
00:34:54,860 --> 00:34:57,580
hand his daughter's hand to the groom.

925
00:34:59,500 --> 00:35:00,260
Xu Zhidong.

926
00:35:01,480 --> 00:35:02,780
You'd better be nice to Bichen.

927
00:35:02,980 --> 00:35:04,120
If not, I won't let you off.

928
00:35:06,680 --> 00:35:07,340
Extend your arm.

929
00:35:08,360 --> 00:35:09,700
Do you actually think
that you're her father?

930
00:35:09,700 --> 00:35:10,460
I am!

931
00:35:11,380 --> 00:35:12,020
Alright.

932
00:35:12,020 --> 00:35:14,540
You two may now exchange your vows.

933
00:35:14,860 --> 00:35:16,060
Our vows?

934
00:35:16,300 --> 00:35:17,260
What should I say?

935
00:35:17,780 --> 00:35:18,540
What should we say?

936
00:35:19,740 --> 00:35:20,980
Getting married is so tiring.

937
00:35:20,980 --> 00:35:22,060
Even my back is sweaty.

938
00:35:22,220 --> 00:35:23,340
How was our performance?

939
00:35:24,020 --> 00:35:25,060
- Come.
- He was terrible.

940
00:35:25,060 --> 00:35:25,620
Bride.

941
00:35:25,620 --> 00:35:27,020
Come, I'll touch up on your makeup.

942
00:35:27,340 --> 00:35:29,780
When the lighting hits you,
your lipstick won't be visible.

943
00:35:29,780 --> 00:35:31,020
We need to apply more lipstick to you.

944
00:35:31,020 --> 00:35:32,540
And, we need to fix your brows too.

945
00:35:32,860 --> 00:35:33,820
You're so professional.

946
00:35:34,820 --> 00:35:35,700
Bichen, are you tired?

947
00:35:35,700 --> 00:35:36,700
Is the baby reacting?

948
00:35:36,860 --> 00:35:38,020
Not for now.

949
00:35:38,020 --> 00:35:39,180
I just feel sleepy all the time.

950
00:35:39,180 --> 00:35:40,700
That's normal. I feel sleepy too.

951
00:35:41,860 --> 00:35:43,740
What does the groom need to do, then?

952
00:35:43,740 --> 00:35:45,060
Nothing. You just need to rest.

953
00:35:46,820 --> 00:35:47,380
Manager,

954
00:35:48,340 --> 00:35:49,340
take a look.

955
00:35:51,760 --> 00:35:53,140
We've finished all the decoration

956
00:35:53,140 --> 00:35:55,140
as per this blueprint.

957
00:35:55,700 --> 00:35:56,500
Have some water.

958
00:35:56,860 --> 00:35:57,980
Thank you.

959
00:35:58,620 --> 00:36:00,140
You may leave first if you're busy.

960
00:36:00,140 --> 00:36:01,620
I don't think I'll be done that quickly.

961
00:36:01,620 --> 00:36:02,500
I'm free anyway.

962
00:36:02,780 --> 00:36:04,540
Don't you need to
go on a date with Mr. Hu?

963
00:36:05,080 --> 00:36:06,980
He's unromantic.
I couldn't care less about him.

964
00:36:07,795 --> 00:36:09,675
If so, you should educate him.

965
00:36:09,700 --> 00:36:10,900
Why should I?

966
00:36:10,900 --> 00:36:12,340
He can learn by himself.

967
00:36:21,860 --> 00:36:22,980
Turn around. Let me see.

968
00:36:26,260 --> 00:36:28,220
I think a light and elegant makeup style

969
00:36:28,220 --> 00:36:29,620
suits Bichen better.

970
00:36:30,960 --> 00:36:32,660
The first set she'll wear
is their wedding attire.

971
00:36:32,660 --> 00:36:33,820
Light makeup isn't appropriate.

972
00:36:33,820 --> 00:36:35,780
Look at all the fancy decorations.

973
00:36:35,780 --> 00:36:37,860
We have to emphasize her radiance.

974
00:36:39,820 --> 00:36:41,500
Nanzhou is a small place indeed.

975
00:36:42,250 --> 00:36:44,140
The makeup of newlywed couples
are too thick.

976
00:36:44,140 --> 00:36:45,050
It's not classy at all.

977
00:36:46,300 --> 00:36:48,260
Do you guys usually go out
for further training?

978
00:36:48,260 --> 00:36:50,260
For example, to France, Korea, or so on?

979
00:36:50,260 --> 00:36:51,850
We usually go to Tieling
for further training.

980
00:36:52,860 --> 00:36:54,460
Actually, I think it's fine.

981
00:36:54,460 --> 00:36:56,100
My parents like bright red makeup.

982
00:37:02,380 --> 00:37:03,540
This is such a festive color.

983
00:37:04,220 --> 00:37:05,420
It's my first time trying this.

984
00:37:05,660 --> 00:37:06,220
Yeah, right?

985
00:37:06,360 --> 00:37:07,350
It does look good on you.

986
00:37:11,360 --> 00:37:13,860
Manager, I think there's something wrong
with the PA system.

987
00:37:14,380 --> 00:37:15,100
Let me see.

988
00:37:15,380 --> 00:37:16,540
Go and switch it off first.

989
00:37:16,540 --> 00:37:17,380
- Yeah, switch it off first.
- Okay.

990
00:37:17,380 --> 00:37:19,580
I guess it's a contact issue.

991
00:37:19,580 --> 00:37:20,620
Let me check.

992
00:37:22,860 --> 00:37:24,300
Is it due to the poor contact?

993
00:37:24,860 --> 00:37:25,500
Let me see.

994
00:37:26,180 --> 00:37:27,140
This shouldn't be.

995
00:37:27,140 --> 00:37:27,860
I told you already.

996
00:37:27,860 --> 00:37:28,740
Is it an issue with the circuit?

997
00:37:28,740 --> 00:37:29,860
You shouldn't be frugal
when it comes to your wedding.

998
00:37:29,860 --> 00:37:30,980
I can't resolve this issue.

999
00:37:30,980 --> 00:37:32,350
We have to find
the maintenance department.

1000
00:37:33,180 --> 00:37:35,140
It's lunch hour for the technicians now.

1001
00:37:35,140 --> 00:37:36,060
That's fine.

1002
00:37:36,060 --> 00:37:37,950
We don't need music, then.
I'll take it as a compromise.

1003
00:37:38,020 --> 00:37:39,180
How can you compromise?

1004
00:37:39,380 --> 00:37:41,060
It's your wedding. It should be perfect.

1005
00:37:41,060 --> 00:37:42,090
We shouldn't compromise.

1006
00:37:42,100 --> 00:37:44,180
No problem. It's not a huge issue.

1007
00:37:45,040 --> 00:37:46,560
I'll hire someone to fix it for you.

1008
00:37:46,660 --> 00:37:47,700
Will you call for Hu Gang?

1009
00:37:48,860 --> 00:37:49,940
No need for that, Meiqi.

1010
00:37:49,940 --> 00:37:51,780
Our technician will come back
at 1:30 P.M.

1011
00:37:52,020 --> 00:37:53,530
It's fine. Mingzhu, you have no idea.

1012
00:37:53,540 --> 00:37:54,940
Hu Gang was waiting for
Meiqi to call him.

1013
00:37:54,940 --> 00:37:56,300
This way, he'll have an out.

1014
00:37:56,660 --> 00:37:58,380
I'm sure he'll come later.

1015
00:38:02,020 --> 00:38:04,140
(Meiqi)

1016
00:38:08,700 --> 00:38:09,940
(Meiqi)

1017
00:38:12,860 --> 00:38:13,380
Hello?

1018
00:38:13,380 --> 00:38:14,380
Hello, Mr. Hu.

1019
00:38:14,380 --> 00:38:15,700
What took you so long?

1020
00:38:16,700 --> 00:38:17,540
Listen.

1021
00:38:17,760 --> 00:38:20,460
My best friend is going through her
wedding rehearsal at Nanxi Hotel now.

1022
00:38:20,460 --> 00:38:22,330
But there's something wrong
with the PA system.

1023
00:38:22,340 --> 00:38:23,780
Come here and fix it.

1024
00:38:24,860 --> 00:38:27,020
What seems to be the issue?

1025
00:38:27,380 --> 00:38:30,140
Is it just static noise?
Or is it a screech?

1026
00:38:30,380 --> 00:38:31,900
How would I know?

1027
00:38:31,900 --> 00:38:32,580
Meiqi,

1028
00:38:32,740 --> 00:38:34,020
I'll explain it to Mr. Hu.

1029
00:38:34,180 --> 00:38:35,160
I'll explain it to him.

1030
00:38:36,860 --> 00:38:37,860
Hello, Mr. Hu?

1031
00:38:38,180 --> 00:38:39,140
I'm Mingzhu.

1032
00:38:39,420 --> 00:38:41,100
Sorry for the trouble.

1033
00:38:41,380 --> 00:38:42,060
It's like this.

1034
00:38:42,060 --> 00:38:44,860
The PA equipment we rented for
Ni Wedding Planning

1035
00:38:45,660 --> 00:38:46,860
is quite dated.

1036
00:38:49,620 --> 00:38:50,620
Ni Wedding Planning?

1037
00:38:51,260 --> 00:38:51,860
Yeah.

1038
00:38:52,220 --> 00:38:54,060
Since you're in the
wedding-planning industry,

1039
00:38:54,070 --> 00:38:56,160
the equipment really has to be
upgraded and updated.

1040
00:38:56,180 --> 00:38:57,410
What if something goes wrong

1041
00:38:57,410 --> 00:38:58,210
- during the wedding?
- Okay.

1042
00:38:58,220 --> 00:38:59,820
The newlywed will regret it
for the rest of their lives.

1043
00:38:59,820 --> 00:39:01,740
If something goes wrong,
we can just fix it.

1044
00:39:01,740 --> 00:39:03,020
You're already looking for help
as we speak.

1045
00:39:03,020 --> 00:39:04,100
What if I can't find any help?

1046
00:39:04,100 --> 00:39:05,100
How could that be?

1047
00:39:05,100 --> 00:39:06,100
You already called him personally.

1048
00:39:06,100 --> 00:39:07,380
I'm sure he would come.

1049
00:39:08,820 --> 00:39:09,500
Meiqi,

1050
00:39:09,900 --> 00:39:12,300
Mr. Hu is tutoring the students now.

1051
00:39:12,300 --> 00:39:13,660
He won't be able to come for now.

1052
00:39:26,180 --> 00:39:26,780
Hu Gang.

1053
00:39:27,620 --> 00:39:28,940
Are you sure you're not free?

1054
00:39:28,940 --> 00:39:30,220
Are you sure about that?

1055
00:39:35,660 --> 00:39:36,660
You'd better think twice.

1056
00:39:39,020 --> 00:39:40,860
Senior year teachers are always busy.

1057
00:39:40,860 --> 00:39:42,380
The NCEE is a huge deal, you know?

1058
00:39:42,700 --> 00:39:44,660
Yeah.
I'm sure Mr. Hu is anxious about it too.

1059
00:39:44,660 --> 00:39:46,060
It's impossible to be filial
and loyal at the same time.

1060
00:39:46,060 --> 00:39:47,340
What nonsense is that?

1061
00:39:47,350 --> 00:39:49,380
I'm not his mother.
Why should he be filial to me?

1062
00:39:52,020 --> 00:39:54,220
I have a report to hand in
this afternoon.

1063
00:39:54,220 --> 00:39:55,160
I'll make a move first.

1064
00:39:55,540 --> 00:39:56,420
You should go ahead.

1065
00:39:56,420 --> 00:39:57,220
You guys can continue.

1066
00:39:57,220 --> 00:39:57,740
Goodbye.

1067
00:39:58,020 --> 00:39:59,380
Goodbye.

1068
00:39:59,620 --> 00:40:01,740
Get rid of your lousy equipment
as soon as possible.

1069
00:40:02,180 --> 00:40:02,700
Sure.

1070
00:40:02,700 --> 00:40:05,040
You should expand your poor connections
as soon as possible too.

1071
00:40:05,820 --> 00:40:07,020
What are you laughing at?

1072
00:40:07,460 --> 00:40:08,700
You want the issue to blow up?

1073
00:40:08,700 --> 00:40:09,700
What are you laughing at?

1074
00:40:10,020 --> 00:40:12,100
Your sister-in-law is so mean.

1075
00:40:12,100 --> 00:40:13,300
Only you guys can tolerate her.

1076
00:40:13,980 --> 00:40:15,580
Meiqi led a pampered life since young.

1077
00:40:15,580 --> 00:40:16,620
She's pretty willful.

1078
00:40:16,620 --> 00:40:17,700
But she's quite nice.

1079
00:40:17,700 --> 00:40:20,320
Yeah. She came to my rehearsal
when she heard that I needed help.

1080
00:40:20,330 --> 00:40:21,540
I would rather she didn't come.

1081
00:40:21,540 --> 00:40:22,340
When she's here,

1082
00:40:22,580 --> 00:40:24,260
we have to serve her like a mistress.

1083
00:40:24,260 --> 00:40:25,500
That's because
you feel guilty toward her.

1084
00:40:25,500 --> 00:40:25,980
I...

1085
00:40:26,860 --> 00:40:28,420
But we have to remind her

1086
00:40:28,420 --> 00:40:29,660
that she's just a bridesmaid.

1087
00:40:29,960 --> 00:40:31,980
What if she gets infuriated
during the wedding?

1088
00:40:32,380 --> 00:40:32,980
Yeah.

1089
00:40:33,620 --> 00:40:35,340
What should we do if she causes trouble

1090
00:40:35,340 --> 00:40:36,100
during our wedding?

1091
00:40:36,240 --> 00:40:37,180
There's nothing to worry about.

1092
00:40:37,180 --> 00:40:38,300
I'm here, aren't I?

1093
00:40:38,500 --> 00:40:39,860
I can do what Meiqi can do.

1094
00:40:39,860 --> 00:40:41,700
I can even do what she cannot.

1095
00:40:41,700 --> 00:40:43,220
Stop fanning the flames.

1096
00:40:43,220 --> 00:40:44,380
I'm not.

1097
00:40:44,380 --> 00:40:45,980
I'm just making a statement here.

1098
00:40:50,020 --> 00:40:50,660
Hu Gang.

1099
00:40:51,020 --> 00:40:52,540
All clear at Nanxi Hotel.

1100
00:40:52,540 --> 00:40:53,680
Come as soon as possible.

1101
00:40:55,620 --> 00:40:56,220
Who?

1102
00:40:56,820 --> 00:40:57,540
Hu Gang?

1103
00:41:00,560 --> 00:41:01,060
You two...

1104
00:41:01,660 --> 00:41:02,980
That's right. It's us now.

1105
00:41:06,020 --> 00:41:06,540
Meiqi,

1106
00:41:06,860 --> 00:41:07,980
I sent you the marketing plan

1107
00:41:07,980 --> 00:41:09,980
from last Thanksgiving.

1108
00:41:10,220 --> 00:41:12,380
Modify it and make one
for this year's Thanksgiving.

1109
00:41:12,740 --> 00:41:14,060
You have to be detailed.

1110
00:41:14,100 --> 00:41:15,700
Do it immediately. I need it urgently.

1111
00:41:16,660 --> 00:41:17,860
Got it, Samantha.

1112
00:41:31,420 --> 00:41:33,820
It seems Mr. Hu doesn't have the guts
to refuse me after all.

1113
00:41:37,820 --> 00:41:38,500
Mr. Hu,

1114
00:41:38,500 --> 00:41:39,380
I think it's fixed.

1115
00:41:39,380 --> 00:41:40,140
Is there sound now?

1116
00:41:40,140 --> 00:41:41,950
Hear it and
see if there's any static noise.

1117
00:41:42,260 --> 00:41:43,140
Nope.

1118
00:41:43,140 --> 00:41:43,940
Nope, huh?

1119
00:41:47,060 --> 00:41:47,660
All done.

1120
00:41:49,380 --> 00:41:49,980
Mr. Hu,

1121
00:41:49,980 --> 00:41:51,180
thank you for coming today.

1122
00:41:51,180 --> 00:41:52,060
You're such a professional.

1123
00:41:52,060 --> 00:41:53,220
Even the technicians

1124
00:41:53,220 --> 00:41:54,380
might not be able to fix this.

1125
00:41:55,060 --> 00:41:56,940
This is an issue with
the transmission cable.

1126
00:41:56,940 --> 00:41:59,420
It's because the console
is too far away from the sound system.

1127
00:41:59,420 --> 00:42:00,740
It'll be fine once you change it

1128
00:42:00,740 --> 00:42:01,550
to a balanced input.

1129
00:42:02,180 --> 00:42:02,980
Thank you, Mr. Hu.

1130
00:42:03,340 --> 00:42:05,540
Not only is Mr. Hu intelligent,

1131
00:42:05,540 --> 00:42:07,140
but he's also very handy.

1132
00:42:07,320 --> 00:42:08,860
Here. A preserved plum as your reward.

1133
00:42:09,900 --> 00:42:10,660
It's your reward.

1134
00:42:10,980 --> 00:42:11,660
Isn't it sweet?

1135
00:42:13,340 --> 00:42:13,860
It is.

1136
00:42:13,860 --> 00:42:14,420
Isn't it?

1137
00:42:15,980 --> 00:42:18,180
Did Mr. Hu have a relationship
with Meiqi before this?

1138
00:42:18,900 --> 00:42:20,380
That's already in the past.

1139
00:42:21,260 --> 00:42:22,620
How did we end up with a love triangle

1140
00:42:22,620 --> 00:42:24,180
on our wedding rehearsal?

1141
00:42:24,180 --> 00:42:25,100
How should I know?

1142
00:42:29,900 --> 00:42:30,460
Hu Gang,

1143
00:42:30,620 --> 00:42:31,660
our home Wi-Fi is down.

1144
00:42:31,860 --> 00:42:33,540
Our Al home system has collapsed.

1145
00:42:33,980 --> 00:42:35,100
Please come and fix it.

1146
00:42:38,340 --> 00:42:39,140
That shouldn't be.

1147
00:42:39,780 --> 00:42:41,660
I installed their Wi-Fi for them.

1148
00:42:41,660 --> 00:42:42,660
It shouldn't be possible.
