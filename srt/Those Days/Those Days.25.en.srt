=Those Days=

00:01:12,431 --> 00:01:14,800
(Adapted from iceread.com novel
"You Xi" by Qingyang Wanxi)

3
00:01:14,980 --> 00:01:17,980
=Episode 25=

4
00:01:18,420 --> 00:01:18,900
Hu Gang,

5
00:01:19,260 --> 00:01:20,340
our home Wi-Fi is down.

6
00:01:20,460 --> 00:01:22,180
Our Al home system has collapsed.

7
00:01:22,580 --> 00:01:23,540
Please come and fix it.

8
00:01:27,020 --> 00:01:27,820
That shouldn't be.

9
00:01:28,460 --> 00:01:30,340
I installed their Wi-Fi for them.

10
00:01:30,340 --> 00:01:32,650
I just installed it not long ago.
It shouldn't be possible.

11
00:01:32,660 --> 00:01:33,500
It malfunctioned, huh?

12
00:01:33,500 --> 00:01:35,180
Great timing.
Let's head there and fix it together.

13
00:01:35,180 --> 00:01:36,840
Is the commotion
not huge enough for you?

14
00:01:37,500 --> 00:01:39,300
Meiqi embarrassed me the entire day.

15
00:01:39,300 --> 00:01:40,660
She criticized me non-stop.

16
00:01:40,660 --> 00:01:44,020
I need to tell her that the bride is
the one paying me, not her, the bridesmaid.

17
00:01:44,020 --> 00:01:45,420
- Precisely.
- She shouldn't tell me what to do.

18
00:01:45,420 --> 00:01:47,700
If you go and argue with her,
you might get your revenge.

19
00:01:47,700 --> 00:01:48,980
But what about Bichen's wedding?

20
00:01:48,980 --> 00:01:49,780
What a joke.

21
00:01:49,780 --> 00:01:52,540
Who said Yuan Bichen
couldn't get married without Feng Meiqi?

22
00:01:52,540 --> 00:01:54,540
Today, I'm going to show her
who's the boss.

23
00:01:54,760 --> 00:01:55,540
What do you think?

24
00:01:55,540 --> 00:01:56,780
Enough. You shouldn't.

25
00:01:56,780 --> 00:01:58,290
I want to show her who's the boss here.

26
00:01:58,300 --> 00:01:58,860
Bring it on.

27
00:02:01,580 --> 00:02:02,260
Meiqi?

28
00:02:04,020 --> 00:02:04,740
Show me, then.

29
00:02:06,420 --> 00:02:07,380
So, you haven't left.

30
00:02:12,210 --> 00:02:14,710
How could I enjoy this fantastic show
if I left early just now?

31
00:02:22,580 --> 00:02:23,300
Hu Gang.

32
00:02:25,460 --> 00:02:26,740
My mother always said

33
00:02:28,220 --> 00:02:30,740
that you were honest and trustworthy.

34
00:02:32,820 --> 00:02:35,020
Is being fickle-minded
considered honest?

35
00:02:35,960 --> 00:02:36,540
That's not it.

36
00:02:36,540 --> 00:02:38,460
Is being fickle-minded
considered trustworthy?

37
00:02:38,660 --> 00:02:40,180
No, that's not it.

38
00:02:40,180 --> 00:02:40,780
You see...

39
00:02:41,180 --> 00:02:43,140
Back then, you told me

40
00:02:43,380 --> 00:02:45,140
not to find you again.

41
00:02:45,140 --> 00:02:45,820
I...

42
00:02:45,820 --> 00:02:47,500
Bichen even wanted to break up
with Xu Zhidong, you know?

43
00:02:47,500 --> 00:02:48,420
She even wanted an abortion!

44
00:02:48,420 --> 00:02:49,540
Even so,
their relationship is still fine!

45
00:02:49,540 --> 00:02:50,860
They're even getting married now.

46
00:02:51,020 --> 00:02:51,740
Calm down.

47
00:02:51,740 --> 00:02:52,940
Don't touch me!

48
00:02:54,020 --> 00:02:55,500
You found out long ago, didn't you?

49
00:02:56,050 --> 00:02:57,180
You didn't tell me on purpose

50
00:02:57,180 --> 00:02:58,740
just so you could mock me, did you?

51
00:02:58,740 --> 00:03:00,180
Meiqi, don't say that.

52
00:03:00,180 --> 00:03:01,180
Go away!

53
00:03:01,820 --> 00:03:02,460
And you.

54
00:03:03,560 --> 00:03:04,940
You're Shen Mingzhu's bosom friend.

55
00:03:04,940 --> 00:03:06,460
I'm sure you know about
my relationship with Hu Gang.

56
00:03:06,460 --> 00:03:07,460
What do you mean by this?

57
00:03:07,980 --> 00:03:09,220
Did you do this on purpose?

58
00:03:09,660 --> 00:03:12,580
Feng Meiqi, you're so twisted
you're practically a joke.

59
00:03:12,580 --> 00:03:14,050
People mocking you
should be normal to you.

60
00:03:14,580 --> 00:03:15,220
Stop it.

61
00:03:15,220 --> 00:03:15,660
Come.

62
00:03:15,660 --> 00:03:16,860
Pregnant girl, go away.

63
00:03:16,860 --> 00:03:18,140
Let's try to reason this out.

64
00:03:18,540 --> 00:03:19,540
Hu Gang did court you,

65
00:03:19,580 --> 00:03:20,660
but did you say yes to him?

66
00:03:21,960 --> 00:03:23,900
When Hu Gang offended you,
did you forgive him?

67
00:03:24,120 --> 00:03:25,860
When Hu Gang did
all those things for you,

68
00:03:25,860 --> 00:03:27,100
have you ever thanked him before?

69
00:03:27,100 --> 00:03:27,940
Don't bring that up.

70
00:03:27,940 --> 00:03:28,620
Go away.

71
00:03:29,100 --> 00:03:31,220
Feng Meiqi, do you truly think
that you're a princess

72
00:03:31,220 --> 00:03:33,100
and the world revolves around you?

73
00:03:33,100 --> 00:03:35,420
Do you even know the word "respect"?

74
00:03:35,500 --> 00:03:37,060
Do you know how to respect other people?

75
00:03:37,060 --> 00:03:39,540
If you lack a loyal and obedient lackey,
get yourself a dog.

76
00:03:39,540 --> 00:03:40,940
It'll wag its tail
in front of you all day long.

77
00:03:40,940 --> 00:03:42,300
And, it'll never retaliate
even if you hurt it.

78
00:03:42,300 --> 00:03:43,220
It'll be loyal to you forever.

79
00:03:43,220 --> 00:03:44,890
Hu Gang,
was that your true thought all along?

80
00:03:44,900 --> 00:03:46,100
Was it true?

81
00:03:46,100 --> 00:03:47,620
That's not it. I'm sorry.

82
00:03:47,620 --> 00:03:48,700
- Who said I wanted your apology?
- That's not true.

83
00:03:48,700 --> 00:03:49,820
Why are you apologizing to her?

84
00:03:49,820 --> 00:03:50,380
Meiqi,

85
00:03:50,380 --> 00:03:51,460
let me send you home, okay?

86
00:03:51,460 --> 00:03:52,580
What are you saying?

87
00:03:53,980 --> 00:03:55,580
I don't even have a home!

88
00:03:56,220 --> 00:03:58,140
Shen Mingzhu, you're my sister-in-law.

89
00:03:58,140 --> 00:04:00,260
Is this how you treat me
after my brother's passing?

90
00:04:03,980 --> 00:04:04,660
Hu Gang,

91
00:04:06,220 --> 00:04:07,060
I'll remember this.

92
00:04:09,780 --> 00:04:10,380
Meiqi!

93
00:04:10,380 --> 00:04:10,860
You...

94
00:04:11,180 --> 00:04:12,100
Lend me your car.

95
00:04:12,100 --> 00:04:13,060
Hurry, hand me the keys.

96
00:04:13,060 --> 00:04:14,060
It's in the bag.

97
00:04:14,180 --> 00:04:15,180
It's in the bag.

98
00:04:19,710 --> 00:04:20,820
- That lass...
- Slow down.

99
00:04:20,820 --> 00:04:21,740
Be careful. You're pregnant.

100
00:04:21,740 --> 00:04:22,580
Slow down.

101
00:04:23,180 --> 00:04:23,900
Meiqi!

102
00:04:35,660 --> 00:04:36,340
Meiqi.

103
00:04:37,160 --> 00:04:38,500
You don't depend on another person

104
00:04:39,700 --> 00:04:40,940
to lead the life you want.

105
00:04:41,940 --> 00:04:43,300
You depend on yourself.

106
00:04:45,080 --> 00:04:47,500
It doesn't matter if you give
Mr. Hu your blessings or not.

107
00:04:48,940 --> 00:04:50,860
(Grave of Feng Jianqi)
You need to learn how to accept reality.

108
00:04:52,140 --> 00:04:54,380
How can I live on

109
00:04:54,460 --> 00:04:56,340
if I still dwell on
Jianqi's passing every day?

110
00:05:21,500 --> 00:05:23,580
But I miss him so much!

111
00:05:25,220 --> 00:05:26,220
I miss him too.

112
00:05:30,860 --> 00:05:33,660
Jianqi was the kindest person
in the world to me!

113
00:05:34,900 --> 00:05:37,060
But he's gone!

114
00:05:39,340 --> 00:05:40,740
You still have your parents.

115
00:05:41,700 --> 00:05:42,740
You still have us.

116
00:05:51,460 --> 00:05:53,860
I think I didn't handle this matter

117
00:05:55,980 --> 00:05:57,300
appropriately.

118
00:05:57,780 --> 00:05:58,900
Which part?

119
00:05:59,540 --> 00:06:00,840
Now that we're in a relationship,

120
00:06:02,340 --> 00:06:03,620
I think I should

121
00:06:05,180 --> 00:06:06,060
tell her about it.

122
00:06:09,750 --> 00:06:10,820
I know you courted Meiqi.

123
00:06:11,220 --> 00:06:13,280
But did she admit
that you were her boyfriend?

124
00:06:13,480 --> 00:06:15,350
And, why do you need
to report yourself to her

125
00:06:15,360 --> 00:06:17,260
just because
you're in a relationship with me?

126
00:06:19,660 --> 00:06:21,980
I think that's unnecessary.

127
00:06:22,180 --> 00:06:23,380
Yeah. That's it, then.

128
00:06:23,380 --> 00:06:24,660
Hello. Please enjoy your meal.

129
00:06:24,820 --> 00:06:25,380
Thank you.

130
00:06:25,380 --> 00:06:26,420
Come, hand the bowl to me.

131
00:06:27,460 --> 00:06:30,380
In life, it's all about eating
and drinking well.

132
00:06:36,980 --> 00:06:37,420
Ni,

133
00:06:38,860 --> 00:06:41,580
you don't seem
to have any worries, do you?

134
00:06:42,360 --> 00:06:43,460
I don't have any worries?

135
00:06:43,460 --> 00:06:44,950
You'll be shocked
when I tell you about them.

136
00:06:44,960 --> 00:06:47,260
But they'll be gone
as long as I don't think about them.

137
00:06:49,260 --> 00:06:50,440
You have such a great personality.

138
00:06:50,980 --> 00:06:51,780
Unlike me.

139
00:06:51,820 --> 00:06:52,620
When I was young,

140
00:06:52,620 --> 00:06:54,780
even if I flunked just one subject,

141
00:06:55,100 --> 00:06:56,620
I would dwell on it every day.

142
00:06:56,620 --> 00:06:58,130
I would think about
this saying every day,

143
00:06:58,140 --> 00:06:59,940
"Learning without reflection
is meaningless.

144
00:06:59,940 --> 00:07:01,660
Reflection without learning
is dangerous".

145
00:07:02,960 --> 00:07:04,820
If so, you should learn from
Luo Yin's example.

146
00:07:05,340 --> 00:07:07,020
"Drink today's wine and be drunk today,

147
00:07:07,380 --> 00:07:09,620
let tomorrow's sorrow
come with tomorrow".

148
00:07:09,860 --> 00:07:10,500
Don't you agree?

149
00:07:10,660 --> 00:07:10,940
Here.

150
00:07:18,620 --> 00:07:21,820
Actually, I knew about
your relationship with Meiqi long ago.

151
00:07:22,450 --> 00:07:24,180
I always wanted
to uphold justice for you.

152
00:07:25,220 --> 00:07:26,660
I think you're a nice guy.

153
00:07:26,670 --> 00:07:29,050
And, you shouldn't play the role
of a dog in a relationship.

154
00:07:29,840 --> 00:07:31,220
But you couldn't curb your passion,

155
00:07:31,220 --> 00:07:32,220
and you did it willingly.

156
00:07:33,020 --> 00:07:34,900
Therefore, I could only
shake my head and sigh.

157
00:07:35,060 --> 00:07:36,580
I couldn't do anything to help you out.

158
00:07:38,940 --> 00:07:39,740
But why?

159
00:07:39,740 --> 00:07:41,140
I have my own principles.

160
00:07:41,180 --> 00:07:43,520
I can snag a bargain,
but I won't resort to outright theft.

161
00:07:45,460 --> 00:07:47,900
Therefore, I only found an opportunity
when there was a crack

162
00:07:47,900 --> 00:07:49,250
between your relationship with her.

163
00:07:51,040 --> 00:07:52,980
But to be honest,
I did set up an elaborate plot.

164
00:07:53,840 --> 00:07:55,700
Delivering meals to you,
pretending to be sick,

165
00:07:55,700 --> 00:07:57,300
all those were parts of my plot.

166
00:07:57,700 --> 00:07:59,740
I've been really good
at this since young.

167
00:08:01,820 --> 00:08:02,460
If so,

168
00:08:03,300 --> 00:08:03,980
you...

169
00:08:03,980 --> 00:08:05,850
You think that I've used Meiqi
to my advantage?

170
00:08:08,120 --> 00:08:10,510
Why didn't it occur to you
that Meiqi was using you instead?

171
00:08:10,660 --> 00:08:13,260
You provided free labor, and you followed
every one of her commands.

172
00:08:14,740 --> 00:08:17,420
I was merely lifting a finger.

173
00:08:18,280 --> 00:08:19,260
So, you did it willingly.

174
00:08:21,460 --> 00:08:23,180
If so, are you
still willing to do it now?

175
00:08:25,860 --> 00:08:26,660
Tell me why.

176
00:08:35,980 --> 00:08:37,620
It's because you were
treated with kindness.

177
00:08:37,620 --> 00:08:38,980
You no longer want to be a suck-up.

178
00:08:38,980 --> 00:08:39,220
I...

179
00:08:40,100 --> 00:08:41,020
I wasn't a suck-up.

180
00:08:42,660 --> 00:08:43,740
Let me ask you this, then.

181
00:08:44,380 --> 00:08:45,820
What if I didn't exist?

182
00:08:46,020 --> 00:08:48,450
Do you think you can maintain
a good relationship with Meiqi?

183
00:08:50,500 --> 00:08:50,940
No.

184
00:08:50,940 --> 00:08:52,040
That's all there is to it.

185
00:08:52,940 --> 00:08:55,100
Since that's the case,
only fools wouldn't pick me.

186
00:08:55,280 --> 00:08:56,900
C is always the best answer if there
are three long and one short answer.

187
00:08:56,900 --> 00:08:57,780
I'm C.

188
00:08:57,780 --> 00:08:59,320
You don't even need to know the answer.

189
00:08:59,940 --> 00:09:00,700
Mr. Hu,

190
00:09:00,940 --> 00:09:04,260
you see, the most important thing
in life is to be happy.

191
00:09:05,140 --> 00:09:06,340
Understood?

192
00:09:07,020 --> 00:09:07,820
Understood.

193
00:09:08,040 --> 00:09:09,940
The most important thing
in life is to be happy.

194
00:09:10,160 --> 00:09:11,350
- Understood.
- Let's dig in.

195
00:09:16,420 --> 00:09:17,700
Can you be nice when we get back?

196
00:09:21,860 --> 00:09:23,380
Alright. I'll go and return the car.

197
00:09:30,020 --> 00:09:30,780
Listen,

198
00:09:30,780 --> 00:09:32,540
I watched a short drama a few days ago.

199
00:09:32,540 --> 00:09:33,500
It was terrifying.

200
00:09:34,500 --> 00:09:35,100
You're back.

201
00:09:35,940 --> 00:09:37,140
The princess is back.

202
00:09:37,940 --> 00:09:40,540
Come, sit here with us.

203
00:09:40,540 --> 00:09:42,020
I even had nightmares about it.

204
00:09:43,260 --> 00:09:44,380
What's wrong?

205
00:09:46,260 --> 00:09:47,820
Why do you look so listless?

206
00:09:48,500 --> 00:09:49,180
Let me see.

207
00:09:49,580 --> 00:09:50,580
Who bullied you?

208
00:09:50,860 --> 00:09:52,260
Tell me. I'll beat him up.

209
00:09:52,300 --> 00:09:54,300
Who do you think you can beat up?

210
00:09:54,300 --> 00:09:54,780
I'll.

211
00:09:55,620 --> 00:09:56,260
It's you.

212
00:09:56,900 --> 00:09:57,540
Me?

213
00:09:58,020 --> 00:09:59,180
But I didn't provoke you.

214
00:10:00,660 --> 00:10:03,060
I told you to top up
our hotel's VIP card, but you didn't.

215
00:10:03,060 --> 00:10:03,660
Great.

216
00:10:03,670 --> 00:10:05,350
My superiors told me off
because of that.

217
00:10:06,060 --> 00:10:07,900
That's it?
Do they even need to go that far?

218
00:10:08,180 --> 00:10:08,940
Yeah.

219
00:10:09,240 --> 00:10:10,460
That's right. Top up your card.

220
00:10:11,060 --> 00:10:11,940
I've permitted it.

221
00:10:11,960 --> 00:10:13,380
Tell your father to top up the card.

222
00:10:13,760 --> 00:10:15,820
You need to use it
when you entertain guests anyway.

223
00:10:15,820 --> 00:10:16,950
You should help our daughter out.

224
00:10:17,060 --> 00:10:17,700
Mrs. Feng,

225
00:10:17,940 --> 00:10:19,340
the soup ingredients are ready.

226
00:10:19,500 --> 00:10:20,820
Please come and take a look.

227
00:10:20,820 --> 00:10:23,180
Please check whether I've followed
your exact procedures.

228
00:10:23,180 --> 00:10:24,460
Alright. Coming.

229
00:10:25,260 --> 00:10:26,220
Lass,

230
00:10:27,100 --> 00:10:28,860
how many times have I told you already?

231
00:10:29,980 --> 00:10:31,860
Don't wait around for things to happen.

232
00:10:31,960 --> 00:10:34,480
You need to resolve the issues you face
with your own abilities.

233
00:10:35,060 --> 00:10:37,220
You come looking for me
whenever you face an issue.

234
00:10:37,980 --> 00:10:39,220
What if one day I...

235
00:10:40,060 --> 00:10:41,120
What will you do by then?

236
00:10:41,140 --> 00:10:42,060
No way!

237
00:10:43,140 --> 00:10:44,620
Dad, you have to be around forever.

238
00:10:45,020 --> 00:10:46,740
You have to live a long life.

239
00:10:46,940 --> 00:10:49,940
Alright.
I hope your blessing will come true.

240
00:10:50,700 --> 00:10:52,380
But I'm speaking the truth.

241
00:10:53,620 --> 00:10:54,580
But Feng,

242
00:10:55,620 --> 00:10:56,740
you can't just do this.

243
00:10:57,660 --> 00:10:59,100
Whenever we talk about Mingzhu,

244
00:10:59,100 --> 00:11:00,060
you talk about unity.

245
00:11:00,060 --> 00:11:02,310
But when it's my turn,
you talk about being independent.

246
00:11:03,060 --> 00:11:04,820
I knew you were going to bring that up.

247
00:11:05,560 --> 00:11:08,300
This time, I didn't top up the card
I used in Mingzhu's hotel either.

248
00:11:09,380 --> 00:11:11,380
I wasn't partial at all.

249
00:11:11,380 --> 00:11:12,780
I'm fair to everyone.

250
00:11:14,420 --> 00:11:15,460
As if.

251
00:11:18,260 --> 00:11:19,540
Next time, when you come back,

252
00:11:20,100 --> 00:11:21,500
you mustn't pull a long face.

253
00:11:21,820 --> 00:11:25,180
You must smile when you see us.

254
00:11:25,300 --> 00:11:26,260
Isn't that great?

255
00:11:28,220 --> 00:11:28,940
That's it.

256
00:11:28,960 --> 00:11:30,250
Look at how beautiful my girl is.

257
00:11:37,340 --> 00:11:38,180
Don't worry.

258
00:11:38,340 --> 00:11:40,460
Meiqi has become calmer
after returning home.

259
00:11:40,580 --> 00:11:41,620
She should be fine.

260
00:11:41,860 --> 00:11:42,820
I knew it.

261
00:11:43,060 --> 00:11:44,220
People are just like clay.

262
00:11:44,220 --> 00:11:46,350
The more you mold them,
the more resilient they become.

263
00:11:46,500 --> 00:11:48,420
You're quite concerned
about her, aren't you?

264
00:11:49,060 --> 00:11:50,700
Why don't you offer Mr. Hu to her again?

265
00:11:50,860 --> 00:11:51,700
What a joke.

266
00:11:51,820 --> 00:11:53,460
Do you think I get to make the call?

267
00:11:53,460 --> 00:11:55,360
You have to ask Mr. Hu
for his permission first.

268
00:11:55,740 --> 00:11:57,740
I just think
that the lass has a rough time.

269
00:11:58,060 --> 00:11:59,950
She's in eloquent,
yet she has a fragile heart.

270
00:11:59,960 --> 00:12:01,250
She doesn't know how to love people
when she wants to.

271
00:12:01,260 --> 00:12:03,340
And, she doesn't know how to
return the favor after being loved.

272
00:12:03,980 --> 00:12:05,550
Perhaps she'll understand in the future.

273
00:12:07,010 --> 00:12:09,950
In the past, it never occurred to me
how I should live as a single mother.

274
00:12:10,020 --> 00:12:12,220
But look, my baby is this big now.

275
00:12:13,820 --> 00:12:14,900
(Shocking Price for Gold)
Your belly,

276
00:12:14,980 --> 00:12:16,820
has it gotten bigger again?

277
00:12:16,820 --> 00:12:18,500
He's growing up at a rapid rate.

278
00:12:19,500 --> 00:12:21,020
Dear baby, you're lucky.

279
00:12:21,020 --> 00:12:23,140
Your mother is going
to buy gold bars for you again.

280
00:12:24,620 --> 00:12:25,180
Let's go.

281
00:12:27,460 --> 00:12:28,100
Hello.

282
00:12:28,360 --> 00:12:30,140
Hello. What would you
like to buy this time?

283
00:12:30,300 --> 00:12:32,220
The timeless gold bars.

284
00:12:32,220 --> 00:12:32,820
Alright.

285
00:12:34,580 --> 00:12:35,900
I want this, Peace and Fortune.

286
00:12:40,820 --> 00:12:41,820
Alright. Here you go.

287
00:12:41,900 --> 00:12:42,500
Okay.

288
00:12:44,560 --> 00:12:45,740
Are you buying this next time?

289
00:12:46,020 --> 00:12:47,700
I'll buy all of them
when I'm rich enough.

290
00:12:48,380 --> 00:12:49,860
Aunt Ni, why don't you sponsor us?

291
00:12:50,660 --> 00:12:51,900
No can do.

292
00:12:54,380 --> 00:12:56,700
Look at our generous baby.

293
00:13:06,420 --> 00:13:07,420
Hello, Mr. Zhang?

294
00:13:08,380 --> 00:13:10,540
I'm Meiqi from Lijun Hotel.

295
00:13:10,960 --> 00:13:13,780
I was wondering how you and your wife
were getting on with your plans.

296
00:13:13,780 --> 00:13:15,180
We would be delighted

297
00:13:15,180 --> 00:13:16,840
to host your son's
100th day celebration.

298
00:13:20,500 --> 00:13:22,340
Oh, you're hosting it
at Manjianghong Hotel?

299
00:13:24,540 --> 00:13:25,140
That's okay.

300
00:13:25,140 --> 00:13:26,820
I hope we have the chance to serve you

301
00:13:26,820 --> 00:13:28,180
in the future.

302
00:13:29,460 --> 00:13:31,340
May your baby grow strong and healthy.

303
00:13:31,980 --> 00:13:32,700
Okay.

304
00:13:33,100 --> 00:13:33,540
Goodbye.

305
00:13:39,380 --> 00:13:41,540
My mother made this beef sauce for you.

306
00:13:41,580 --> 00:13:42,980
It contains black wolf berries.

307
00:13:42,980 --> 00:13:44,100
Oh yeah, there's this too.

308
00:13:44,420 --> 00:13:45,700
And this paper bag as well.

309
00:13:45,760 --> 00:13:46,760
It's dried bamboo shoots.

310
00:13:46,780 --> 00:13:48,540
Cook them with roasted pork,
and you'll be in for a treat.

311
00:13:48,540 --> 00:13:50,100
How can I finish them all?

312
00:13:50,100 --> 00:13:50,740
You can do it.

313
00:13:50,740 --> 00:13:51,740
Please help me thank...

314
00:13:52,220 --> 00:13:53,450
Thank your mother on my behalf.

315
00:13:54,460 --> 00:13:55,820
How is she doing?

316
00:13:55,820 --> 00:13:57,300
She's doing great.

317
00:13:57,540 --> 00:13:58,620
You may not know,

318
00:13:58,740 --> 00:14:00,700
but she's busy every day.

319
00:14:00,700 --> 00:14:02,380
She prepares three sets of everything.

320
00:14:02,380 --> 00:14:04,220
She's energetic way beyond her age.

321
00:14:04,340 --> 00:14:05,540
If we were in the ancient era,

322
00:14:05,540 --> 00:14:08,120
I suppose she could've joined
the military on Xu Zhidong's behalf.

323
00:14:12,020 --> 00:14:12,620
So,

324
00:14:13,340 --> 00:14:15,700
regarding my husband's selection,

325
00:14:16,080 --> 00:14:17,950
have you received any news
from your father-in-law?

326
00:14:18,100 --> 00:14:18,780
Not yet.

327
00:14:21,340 --> 00:14:23,500
What about this? I'll head back
and ask him about it.

328
00:14:24,980 --> 00:14:25,660
Mingzhu,

329
00:14:26,100 --> 00:14:29,140
I know it's difficult for you
to ask for a favor there.

330
00:14:29,540 --> 00:14:30,940
I must've troubled you.

331
00:14:30,940 --> 00:14:31,820
I'm so sorry about this.

332
00:14:31,820 --> 00:14:32,660
It's fine.

333
00:14:32,940 --> 00:14:34,700
I only told my father-in-law about it.

334
00:14:34,700 --> 00:14:35,940
My mother-in-law has no idea.

335
00:14:35,960 --> 00:14:37,420
I'm glad that it's not troubling you.

336
00:14:37,420 --> 00:14:38,060
Not at all.

337
00:14:38,980 --> 00:14:40,780
If Zhang Hao is promoted,

338
00:14:40,780 --> 00:14:42,580
he'll make an extra 10k or 20k per year.

339
00:14:43,240 --> 00:14:45,920
You'll make the same amount
if you just publish a few more posts.

340
00:14:46,060 --> 00:14:47,340
My dear sister,

341
00:14:48,980 --> 00:14:51,340
you have no idea
how difficult it is to make money now.

342
00:14:51,620 --> 00:14:53,820
Official accounts
are popping up everywhere.

343
00:14:53,820 --> 00:14:55,260
Whenever there's a hot piece of news,

344
00:14:55,460 --> 00:14:57,420
people will write about it
from every angle.

345
00:14:57,420 --> 00:14:59,620
It's truly difficult for me
to gain attention.

346
00:15:00,460 --> 00:15:03,020
If your posts don't get many clicks,
they won't generate ad revenues.

347
00:15:03,020 --> 00:15:04,580
Without ads,
there's no way to make money.

348
00:15:04,580 --> 00:15:06,740
If there's no money,
I have to pay for it with my own.

349
00:15:07,180 --> 00:15:08,340
I have to pay the office rent,

350
00:15:08,340 --> 00:15:09,900
utility bills, management fees...

351
00:15:10,340 --> 00:15:12,220
Oh yeah, and the wage of
my personal assistant.

352
00:15:12,220 --> 00:15:13,580
I have to pay all of that.

353
00:15:14,300 --> 00:15:16,100
Whenever I think about these bills,

354
00:15:16,220 --> 00:15:17,660
I can't sleep at night.

355
00:15:17,820 --> 00:15:19,820
It makes my hair fall out in clumps.

356
00:15:19,820 --> 00:15:20,460
Is that so?

357
00:15:21,340 --> 00:15:22,980
I suppose you have a lot of hair, then.

358
00:15:25,260 --> 00:15:26,380
It must've been tough.

359
00:15:27,140 --> 00:15:27,980
Forget about

360
00:15:27,980 --> 00:15:29,860
this tiny studio of ours.

361
00:15:30,580 --> 00:15:33,540
Even those big-time clients

362
00:15:33,660 --> 00:15:35,580
who've sailed smoothly for decades

363
00:15:35,580 --> 00:15:37,460
will be knocked off their feet
by a single wave,

364
00:15:37,460 --> 00:15:37,980
you know?

365
00:15:37,980 --> 00:15:39,660
Such examples are everywhere.

366
00:15:41,560 --> 00:15:42,420
I have to stop here.

367
00:15:42,420 --> 00:15:43,690
I need to visit the F&B Department.

368
00:15:43,700 --> 00:15:45,060
Someone complained about Rufeng Liquor.

369
00:15:45,060 --> 00:15:46,420
I have to help
the suppliers deal with it.

370
00:15:46,420 --> 00:15:47,620
Is that included
in your job scope as well?

371
00:15:47,820 --> 00:15:49,950
Didn't I tell you already?
It's difficult to make money nowadays.

372
00:15:52,160 --> 00:15:53,940
I have to make sure
I provide good services

373
00:15:53,940 --> 00:15:55,330
to my clients
while I can still move around.

374
00:15:55,340 --> 00:15:57,220
I'm going to keep every penny I earn

375
00:15:57,220 --> 00:15:58,980
firmly in my own hands.

376
00:15:59,260 --> 00:15:59,940
Let me join you.

377
00:15:59,940 --> 00:16:01,560
- It's fine. Just resume your work.
- This is troublesome indeed.

378
00:16:01,570 --> 00:16:02,860
Sorry that you have
to come here personally.

379
00:16:02,860 --> 00:16:03,580
Mr. Ding.

380
00:16:03,740 --> 00:16:06,380
All those alcoholics love to cause trouble
after getting drunk.

381
00:16:07,220 --> 00:16:08,260
But to us,

382
00:16:08,260 --> 00:16:09,580
the customer is always right.

383
00:16:10,100 --> 00:16:11,100
Please bear with it.

384
00:16:11,500 --> 00:16:12,660
No problem.

385
00:16:12,740 --> 00:16:14,020
Let's discuss this in the office.

386
00:16:14,360 --> 00:16:16,700
By the way, Mr. Feng has used up
all the money on his card.

387
00:16:16,900 --> 00:16:18,540
And now, he owes us a few thousand yuan.

388
00:16:18,580 --> 00:16:20,420
You know this too.
Business is hard nowadays.

389
00:16:20,500 --> 00:16:21,580
Please tell him about it later.

390
00:16:21,580 --> 00:16:23,140
That's fine. I'll pay it off after this.

391
00:16:23,220 --> 00:16:24,260
There's no rush.

392
00:16:24,740 --> 00:16:25,700
It just occurred to me.

393
00:16:25,700 --> 00:16:26,740
That's why I told you.

394
00:16:26,740 --> 00:16:27,380
It'll be fine.

395
00:16:27,460 --> 00:16:28,860
I'll ask him to reimburse me later.

396
00:16:28,860 --> 00:16:30,180
Okay. Let's go, then.

397
00:16:30,180 --> 00:16:30,700
I'll make a move now.

398
00:16:30,700 --> 00:16:31,650
Okay. You guys can go ahead.

399
00:16:31,660 --> 00:16:32,580
Come. Over here.

400
00:16:35,700 --> 00:16:36,300
What?

401
00:16:37,340 --> 00:16:38,020
I owe them money?

402
00:16:39,420 --> 00:16:41,300
So, how much have you paid
on my behalf?

403
00:16:41,820 --> 00:16:42,780
3,500 yuan.

404
00:16:42,790 --> 00:16:44,620
Okay. Sorry about that.
I'll transfer the money to you now.

405
00:16:44,620 --> 00:16:46,220
Dad, it's fine. There's no rush.

406
00:16:46,220 --> 00:16:47,300
I'm so forgetful now.

407
00:16:49,940 --> 00:16:51,260
(Balance)

408
00:16:55,540 --> 00:16:56,860
What was my password again?

409
00:16:56,860 --> 00:16:58,220
I can't remember it.

410
00:16:58,220 --> 00:16:58,940
Dad, it's fine.

411
00:16:58,940 --> 00:17:00,160
You don't need to pay me back.

412
00:17:00,260 --> 00:17:01,100
Don't worry.

413
00:17:01,110 --> 00:17:02,020
I'll transfer it to you later.

414
00:17:02,020 --> 00:17:03,460
It's fine. You don't need to pay me.

415
00:17:08,220 --> 00:17:08,700
Lihua.

416
00:17:09,580 --> 00:17:10,060
Lihua?

417
00:17:10,660 --> 00:17:11,820
I need to tell you something.

418
00:17:11,940 --> 00:17:12,580
What's wrong?

419
00:17:13,980 --> 00:17:16,700
Transfer 3,500 yuan to Mingzhu.

420
00:17:16,980 --> 00:17:17,700
For what?

421
00:17:17,760 --> 00:17:19,500
Why should I transfer the money to her?
Why aren't you doing it?

422
00:17:19,500 --> 00:17:20,960
I didn't bring that much money with me

423
00:17:20,960 --> 00:17:22,140
when I went to their hotel last time.

424
00:17:22,140 --> 00:17:23,370
Mingzhu paid off
the balance on my behalf.

425
00:17:23,380 --> 00:17:23,900
Transfer the money to her.

426
00:17:23,900 --> 00:17:25,740
I'll transfer it to you
when I come back from work.

427
00:17:27,860 --> 00:17:29,700
You see, I forgot my password.

428
00:17:29,700 --> 00:17:31,140
It's all because you drink too much.

429
00:17:31,140 --> 00:17:32,460
You even forgot about your password.

430
00:17:32,460 --> 00:17:33,140
Keep on drinking,

431
00:17:33,140 --> 00:17:34,580
and you'll grow senile.

432
00:17:35,360 --> 00:17:36,860
I'll transfer the money to her later.

433
00:17:42,620 --> 00:17:45,460
Even those big-time clients

434
00:17:45,700 --> 00:17:47,460
who've sailed smoothly for decades

435
00:17:47,460 --> 00:17:49,420
will be knocked off their feet
by a single wave,

436
00:17:49,420 --> 00:17:49,940
you know?

437
00:17:49,940 --> 00:17:51,540
Such examples are everywhere.

438
00:17:51,540 --> 00:17:52,340
(Usable Balance)

439
00:18:29,060 --> 00:18:29,820
(Jianqi,)

440
00:18:30,460 --> 00:18:32,620
(I'm going to secure
this house for my baby.)

441
00:18:33,140 --> 00:18:34,380
(Will you blame me for this?)

442
00:18:34,960 --> 00:18:37,180
(I'm going to do it even if
you're blaming me for it.)

443
00:18:37,380 --> 00:18:38,700
(It's because I'm a mother.)

444
00:18:45,380 --> 00:18:46,300
Are you saying

445
00:18:47,120 --> 00:18:49,350
that you want to transfer
the ownership of this marital house?

446
00:18:51,060 --> 00:18:53,620
This unit is registered
under Jianqi's name.

447
00:18:54,500 --> 00:18:56,060
When Jianqi left,

448
00:18:56,540 --> 00:18:57,660
you guys promised me

449
00:18:57,940 --> 00:18:59,420
that I would own this house

450
00:19:00,060 --> 00:19:01,620
once I gave birth to your grandchild.

451
00:19:02,700 --> 00:19:04,340
Back then, I didn't think much about it.

452
00:19:04,750 --> 00:19:06,620
But now, my belly is
growing bigger and bigger.

453
00:19:06,760 --> 00:19:08,860
I won't be able
to move around freely in the future.

454
00:19:08,960 --> 00:19:11,160
Therefore, I want to transfer
the ownership of the house

455
00:19:11,580 --> 00:19:12,860
while I can still move around.

456
00:19:15,100 --> 00:19:17,100
I'm sure your parents
gave you that idea.

457
00:19:17,940 --> 00:19:19,340
No, it's my idea.

458
00:19:21,580 --> 00:19:24,060
The title deed is in Jianqi's name.

459
00:19:24,060 --> 00:19:27,020
It'll be troublesome
to do an ownership transfer.

460
00:19:27,020 --> 00:19:27,860
It's not.

461
00:19:28,060 --> 00:19:29,280
I've already inquired about it.

462
00:19:29,290 --> 00:19:30,850
I just need to get a notarized document

463
00:19:31,300 --> 00:19:33,940
stating that you and Dad
will relinquish the inheritance right.

464
00:19:37,780 --> 00:19:39,300
It's not like my parents will scam you.

465
00:19:39,580 --> 00:19:40,860
Why are you getting it notarized?

466
00:19:41,660 --> 00:19:42,420
Precisely.

467
00:19:43,900 --> 00:19:45,340
We're a family.

468
00:19:46,420 --> 00:19:49,020
We will keep our promise.

469
00:19:49,500 --> 00:19:50,140
Besides,

470
00:19:50,940 --> 00:19:52,700
the title deed is in Jianqi's name.

471
00:19:52,700 --> 00:19:54,260
That means the house is yours.

472
00:19:55,700 --> 00:19:57,540
The house isn't mine

473
00:19:58,180 --> 00:19:59,950
as long as the title deed
isn't in my name.

474
00:20:03,900 --> 00:20:06,860
But what if you get remarried?

475
00:20:07,380 --> 00:20:08,700
This is pre-marital property.

476
00:20:09,100 --> 00:20:11,340
I'm securing it for my child.

477
00:20:12,060 --> 00:20:13,420
Once I give birth to my child,

478
00:20:13,430 --> 00:20:15,060
I'll include his name in the title deed.

479
00:20:16,080 --> 00:20:17,780
If so, you can just add
the child's name to the title deed

480
00:20:17,780 --> 00:20:19,500
once he's born.

481
00:20:20,180 --> 00:20:21,450
Why go through all that trouble?

482
00:20:22,180 --> 00:20:24,180
What about my interest as his mother?

483
00:20:24,710 --> 00:20:27,420
Did you decide to give birth to a child
only because of the interest?

484
00:20:30,420 --> 00:20:32,180
I decided to have a child first.

485
00:20:32,820 --> 00:20:35,300
That's why I'm trying to secure
our interests here.

486
00:20:35,300 --> 00:20:35,900
Wait.

487
00:20:36,580 --> 00:20:38,940
Our family helped out
in decorating the house

488
00:20:38,940 --> 00:20:39,890
and the children's room.

489
00:20:39,900 --> 00:20:41,100
Isn't that good enough?

490
00:20:41,210 --> 00:20:43,100
Must you talk about
such materialistic things...

491
00:20:43,100 --> 00:20:44,540
Enough.

492
00:20:47,020 --> 00:20:49,300
We should keep our promise.

493
00:20:51,980 --> 00:20:54,140
Mingzhu, go and perform the procedure.

494
00:20:54,460 --> 00:20:56,050
We'll do our best to cooperate with you.

495
00:20:56,660 --> 00:20:57,500
Thank you, Dad.

496
00:20:59,820 --> 00:21:00,700
I'll head to work now.

497
00:21:05,500 --> 00:21:06,060
Let's eat.

498
00:21:14,860 --> 00:21:15,860
That was too hasty.

499
00:21:16,960 --> 00:21:18,860
You told your parents-in-law that you
wanted to do an ownership transfer,

500
00:21:18,860 --> 00:21:20,120
and they actually agreed to it?

501
00:21:21,620 --> 00:21:23,940
But I offended
my mother-in-law and Meiqi again.

502
00:21:24,700 --> 00:21:26,140
That's fine.

503
00:21:26,140 --> 00:21:28,240
If you don't offend them,
you'll swallow grievances.

504
00:21:29,540 --> 00:21:31,020
Yesterday, I saw my father-in-law's

505
00:21:31,020 --> 00:21:32,180
Alipay account.

506
00:21:32,480 --> 00:21:33,940
He only has a few hundred yuan left.

507
00:21:34,160 --> 00:21:36,660
I was wondering if his company
is facing some sort of trouble.

508
00:21:39,140 --> 00:21:40,060
It won't be that bad.

509
00:21:42,140 --> 00:21:43,900
Anyway, I want to help my child

510
00:21:44,260 --> 00:21:45,700
to hold on to everything

511
00:21:45,700 --> 00:21:46,820
that I can grasp in my hand.

512
00:21:50,980 --> 00:21:52,860
Am I being too selfish?

513
00:21:53,820 --> 00:21:55,140
How is this selfish?

514
00:21:55,160 --> 00:21:56,420
You're doing this for your child.

515
00:21:56,420 --> 00:21:57,580
It's not selfish at all.

516
00:21:57,590 --> 00:21:58,680
Besides, your parents-in-law

517
00:21:58,690 --> 00:22:00,220
already promised to give you the house.

518
00:22:00,220 --> 00:22:00,780
Am I right?

519
00:22:00,860 --> 00:22:02,620
It's time for them
to keep their promise.

520
00:22:02,820 --> 00:22:03,980
I suppose you could say that.

521
00:22:04,820 --> 00:22:06,260
Anyway, my mother-in-law and Meiqi

522
00:22:06,260 --> 00:22:07,460
were quite upset.

523
00:22:09,500 --> 00:22:10,740
Meiqi is upset, huh?

524
00:22:12,260 --> 00:22:12,900
Oh no.

525
00:22:12,900 --> 00:22:13,620
What's wrong?

526
00:22:13,660 --> 00:22:15,440
Will it affect her
from being Bichen's bridesmaid?

00:22:23,220 --> 00:22:23,660

00:22:44,540 --> 00:22:45,180
All done.

540
00:22:45,980 --> 00:22:47,380
The ownership has been transferred.

541
00:22:48,260 --> 00:22:49,700
Your name is in the title deed now.

542
00:22:50,140 --> 00:22:51,140
You can rest at ease now.

543
00:22:51,620 --> 00:22:52,500
Thank you, Mom.

544
00:22:54,620 --> 00:22:55,340
Mingzhu,

545
00:22:56,180 --> 00:22:59,620
we also have some conditions
that you need to fulfill.

546
00:22:59,620 --> 00:23:00,550
Is that okay with you?

547
00:23:01,420 --> 00:23:02,060
Please go ahead.

548
00:23:02,740 --> 00:23:03,660
First condition,

549
00:23:04,500 --> 00:23:06,060
you cannot take any men home.

550
00:23:07,660 --> 00:23:08,380
I won't.

551
00:23:09,260 --> 00:23:10,220
Once the child is born,

552
00:23:10,220 --> 00:23:12,750
you need to include the child's name
in the title deed as well.

553
00:23:13,940 --> 00:23:14,580
And,

554
00:23:14,860 --> 00:23:16,780
the child's surname must be Feng.

555
00:23:18,080 --> 00:23:19,980
Jianqi and I have already
reached a consensus.

556
00:23:20,080 --> 00:23:21,780
If it's a boy,
we'll call him Feng Xiangru.

557
00:23:21,790 --> 00:23:23,440
If it's a girl,
we'll call her Feng Yimo.

558
00:23:23,960 --> 00:23:24,820
- That's pretty good.
- I like that.

559
00:23:24,820 --> 00:23:26,100
Their names are pretty nice.

560
00:23:26,100 --> 00:23:27,020
Yeah.

561
00:23:27,620 --> 00:23:28,220
What if...

562
00:23:29,620 --> 00:23:31,380
You see, this house

563
00:23:31,380 --> 00:23:33,420
is a cherished memory
Jianqi had left for us.

564
00:23:33,430 --> 00:23:34,140
You know this too.

565
00:23:34,140 --> 00:23:36,100
Your mother-in-law and I
only have one son.

566
00:23:37,060 --> 00:23:40,300
We're also willing to give the house

567
00:23:40,780 --> 00:23:42,060
to you and your child.

568
00:23:45,060 --> 00:23:46,150
I also have one condition.

569
00:23:47,780 --> 00:23:48,660
In the future,

570
00:23:48,670 --> 00:23:51,360
no matter how difficult life is,
no matter how much money you need,

571
00:23:51,860 --> 00:23:53,860
you mustn't use it as a mortgage.

572
00:23:55,380 --> 00:23:56,060
Dad, Mom,

573
00:23:56,460 --> 00:23:57,340
don't worry.

574
00:23:57,900 --> 00:23:59,940
You guys bought this house for your son.

575
00:24:01,040 --> 00:24:02,950
Since Jianqi wasn't
fortunate enough to live here,

576
00:24:03,700 --> 00:24:04,780
he's leaving it to his son.

577
00:24:06,360 --> 00:24:07,700
I'm just looking after it for him.

578
00:24:10,940 --> 00:24:12,180
Okay. Thank you.

579
00:24:12,900 --> 00:24:13,580
Here, take it.

580
00:24:14,820 --> 00:24:15,780
Thank you, Dad and Mom.

581
00:24:27,620 --> 00:24:28,220
Mingzhu.

582
00:24:28,900 --> 00:24:30,020
You're a house owner now.

583
00:24:30,020 --> 00:24:30,900
Mingzhu.

584
00:24:30,980 --> 00:24:32,280
You should give me a red packet.

585
00:24:33,580 --> 00:24:34,450
Stop causing trouble.

586
00:24:34,780 --> 00:24:35,780
You have to give me one.

587
00:24:35,780 --> 00:24:38,140
If not, I'll cause trouble for you
at your new house every day.

588
00:24:38,140 --> 00:24:39,060
Feng and his family

589
00:24:39,070 --> 00:24:41,020
did keep their promise.
They're quite credible.

590
00:24:41,740 --> 00:24:42,820
Our daughter did great.

591
00:24:43,260 --> 00:24:45,000
Now that she owns a house,

592
00:24:45,010 --> 00:24:47,980
she'll face much less financial pressure
after she gives birth to her child.

593
00:24:47,980 --> 00:24:48,640
Don't you agree?

594
00:24:48,860 --> 00:24:50,100
It's a safety net.

595
00:24:54,820 --> 00:24:56,300
(Shen Mingzhu)

596
00:24:56,300 --> 00:24:58,660
(People's Republic of China
Real Estate Ownership Certificate)

597
00:25:06,180 --> 00:25:07,160
The two kids,

598
00:25:07,170 --> 00:25:09,660
they wrote quite a long list.
They've invited plenty of people.

599
00:25:09,660 --> 00:25:10,780
Is that so? I'll take a look.

600
00:25:11,550 --> 00:25:12,780
Where are you going? Sit down.

601
00:25:12,780 --> 00:25:14,020
What's wrong? What's the big deal?

602
00:25:14,020 --> 00:25:14,940
Just sit down.

603
00:25:15,380 --> 00:25:16,420
You scared me.

604
00:25:16,980 --> 00:25:17,620
Listen.

605
00:25:18,060 --> 00:25:19,460
Now, we need to learn

606
00:25:19,940 --> 00:25:20,780
how to let go.

607
00:25:22,020 --> 00:25:22,660
Understood?

608
00:25:24,460 --> 00:25:25,340
Who's next?

609
00:25:26,020 --> 00:25:27,620
Shen Mingzhu and her family.

610
00:25:28,660 --> 00:25:29,980
This is a model example.

611
00:25:31,700 --> 00:25:35,660
I heard from Meiqi that Mingzhu had a
heartfelt conversation with her parents.

612
00:25:36,300 --> 00:25:37,620
They gave her the marital house.

613
00:25:37,780 --> 00:25:38,580
That's a good thing.

614
00:25:39,460 --> 00:25:40,340
Initially, I thought

615
00:25:40,340 --> 00:25:42,020
your sister looked weak and gentle.

616
00:25:42,180 --> 00:25:43,480
But in reality, she's top-notch.

617
00:25:43,820 --> 00:25:44,660
Of course.

618
00:25:45,420 --> 00:25:47,060
Of course my second sister is top-notch.

619
00:25:47,060 --> 00:25:49,900
When you wanted to get an abortion,
nobody could stop you.

620
00:25:49,900 --> 00:25:52,060
But when my sister showed up,
you yielded immediately.

621
00:25:52,440 --> 00:25:54,380
Just tell me whether or not
that was your fault.

622
00:25:54,500 --> 00:25:55,900
Wasn't that your fault?

623
00:25:55,900 --> 00:25:56,640
Lower your volume.

624
00:25:56,700 --> 00:25:57,540
Be careful.

625
00:25:57,540 --> 00:25:58,340
Mind your tummy.

626
00:25:58,740 --> 00:26:00,300
Now, there's another life within you.

627
00:26:09,820 --> 00:26:10,500
Xiu'e.

628
00:26:18,540 --> 00:26:19,340
Mr. Shen.

629
00:26:26,660 --> 00:26:27,340
Mr. Shen.

630
00:26:29,240 --> 00:26:30,140
- What's wrong?
- I...

631
00:26:30,580 --> 00:26:31,180
Hey.

632
00:26:31,420 --> 00:26:32,020
You see...

633
00:26:32,940 --> 00:26:34,540
- You...
- Yeah.

634
00:26:34,660 --> 00:26:36,420
Why don't you come inside?

635
00:26:36,420 --> 00:26:38,140
Don't. It's almost lunchtime.

636
00:26:38,620 --> 00:26:40,020
We can hold the conversation here.

637
00:26:40,980 --> 00:26:42,500
Yeah. Let's hold it here.

638
00:26:42,500 --> 00:26:44,300
You see, Zhidong...

639
00:26:44,700 --> 00:26:46,940
My son, Zhidong, is getting married.

640
00:26:46,960 --> 00:26:48,620
I'm here to deliver
the wedding invitation.

641
00:26:48,620 --> 00:26:49,860
You guys are our VIPs.

642
00:26:49,860 --> 00:26:53,100
I have to invite you two personally.

643
00:26:53,500 --> 00:26:55,460
Mrs. Xu, you see,

644
00:26:55,460 --> 00:26:57,340
we've been quite busy lately.

645
00:26:57,340 --> 00:26:57,820
Yeah.

646
00:26:57,820 --> 00:26:59,260
But don't worry. We'll surely
give you guys the gift money.

647
00:26:59,260 --> 00:27:00,780
But we won't be attending the wedding.

648
00:27:00,780 --> 00:27:02,060
That's not it.

649
00:27:02,060 --> 00:27:03,500
I'm not here to demand
gift money from your family.

650
00:27:03,500 --> 00:27:04,060
I'm serious.

651
00:27:04,060 --> 00:27:05,740
The gift money doesn't matter to us.

652
00:27:05,940 --> 00:27:08,220
You see, I came here

653
00:27:08,220 --> 00:27:10,820
to invite you all to
my son's wedding earnestly.

654
00:27:11,020 --> 00:27:12,580
I also wish to use this opportunity

655
00:27:12,580 --> 00:27:15,900
to ease the tension
between our families.

656
00:27:15,980 --> 00:27:17,180
Ease the tension?

657
00:27:17,500 --> 00:27:19,500
Our families have a great relationship.

658
00:27:19,500 --> 00:27:20,500
There's no tension at all.

659
00:27:20,500 --> 00:27:21,660
We don't need it.

660
00:27:21,660 --> 00:27:22,580
You're overthinking it.

661
00:27:22,660 --> 00:27:23,940
That's not it, Xiu'e.

662
00:27:24,220 --> 00:27:26,780
Xiu'e, you see, what happened in the past

663
00:27:27,740 --> 00:27:28,780
was my fault.

664
00:27:29,220 --> 00:27:29,860
I'm serious.

665
00:27:30,140 --> 00:27:31,500
Let me apologize to you two.

666
00:27:31,500 --> 00:27:34,140
I'm so sorry about it.

667
00:27:34,140 --> 00:27:35,700
I've let you guys down.

668
00:27:35,700 --> 00:27:36,460
Don't say that.

669
00:27:36,460 --> 00:27:38,580
You see, I'm a fool.

670
00:27:38,580 --> 00:27:40,420
I might be harsh at times.

671
00:27:40,420 --> 00:27:42,300
Please don't hold it against me.

672
00:27:42,300 --> 00:27:45,380
Please don't hold a grudge against me.

673
00:27:45,900 --> 00:27:47,580
You see, recently,

674
00:27:48,020 --> 00:27:49,460
I've been reflecting upon my actions.

675
00:27:49,980 --> 00:27:52,460
And now, I finally understand.

676
00:27:53,340 --> 00:27:54,980
No matter what, you guys were the ones

677
00:27:54,980 --> 00:27:57,340
who raised Mingzhu

678
00:27:57,700 --> 00:27:59,220
and allowed her to thrive.

679
00:27:59,220 --> 00:28:00,900
And, you guys did a great job too.

680
00:28:01,340 --> 00:28:02,020
Don't you agree?

681
00:28:02,260 --> 00:28:04,420
I'm hugely indebted to you two.

682
00:28:04,420 --> 00:28:06,820
There's no way
I can repay your kindness.

683
00:28:06,820 --> 00:28:07,500
Am I right?

684
00:28:07,900 --> 00:28:09,260
To be honest,

685
00:28:09,700 --> 00:28:11,620
you two are more fitting

686
00:28:12,020 --> 00:28:15,260
to be the parents of Mingzhu
instead of me and Xu Dacheng.

687
00:28:15,340 --> 00:28:18,180
Besides, Mingzhu is all grown up.

688
00:28:18,660 --> 00:28:20,060
And, she has her own family now.

689
00:28:20,060 --> 00:28:21,620
Therefore, we...

690
00:28:21,980 --> 00:28:23,140
It doesn't matter

691
00:28:23,780 --> 00:28:25,140
if we acknowledge her again or not.

692
00:28:25,620 --> 00:28:26,260
Don't you agree?

693
00:28:26,700 --> 00:28:28,620
Therefore, this is my opinion.

694
00:28:29,500 --> 00:28:31,420
In the future,
I won't bring up anything related

695
00:28:31,420 --> 00:28:33,580
to acknowledging her
as my daughter again.

696
00:28:33,780 --> 00:28:35,020
Am I right? Besides,

697
00:28:35,420 --> 00:28:36,700
now, I know

698
00:28:36,700 --> 00:28:37,860
that I have a daughter

699
00:28:37,860 --> 00:28:39,340
who's still alive.

700
00:28:39,340 --> 00:28:40,420
And, she's leading a good life too.

701
00:28:40,420 --> 00:28:42,180
You guys are taking great care of her.

702
00:28:42,420 --> 00:28:44,340
I don't need to be worried at all.

703
00:28:44,580 --> 00:28:45,260
Am I right?

704
00:28:45,540 --> 00:28:46,780
I can rest at ease.

705
00:28:47,900 --> 00:28:49,660
So, what do you guys think?

706
00:28:53,100 --> 00:28:54,140
Why are you looking at me?

707
00:28:58,260 --> 00:28:58,860
Sure.

708
00:28:59,180 --> 00:29:00,660
Come inside. Here.

709
00:29:00,820 --> 00:29:02,020
We shouldn't talk here.

710
00:29:02,140 --> 00:29:02,580
But I...

711
00:29:02,580 --> 00:29:03,650
Hurry, please come inside.

712
00:29:04,340 --> 00:29:05,020
Come inside.

713
00:29:05,020 --> 00:29:05,660
Okay.

714
00:29:05,860 --> 00:29:08,060
Where will they
be holding their wedding?

715
00:29:08,620 --> 00:29:10,180
At Nanxi Hotel.

716
00:29:10,260 --> 00:29:10,860
Nanxi Hotel?

717
00:29:10,860 --> 00:29:11,960
That's right. Nanxi Hotel.

718
00:29:11,960 --> 00:29:13,620
Isn't that the hotel
Mingzhu is working in?

719
00:29:13,620 --> 00:29:15,780
That's right.
It'll be included in Mingzhu's KPI.

720
00:29:16,820 --> 00:29:18,940
That's great to hear.

721
00:29:19,980 --> 00:29:21,020
Have a seat. Here.

722
00:29:22,460 --> 00:29:23,540
Please don't.

723
00:29:23,540 --> 00:29:24,580
Sitting here is fine.

724
00:29:25,020 --> 00:29:25,620
Have a seat.

725
00:29:25,620 --> 00:29:26,980
No. I'll sit here.

726
00:29:26,980 --> 00:29:28,100
This place is fine.

727
00:29:37,020 --> 00:29:37,660
Xiu'e,

728
00:29:38,220 --> 00:29:40,260
so...

729
00:29:40,660 --> 00:29:42,100
I hope you'll stop being mad at me.

730
00:29:42,420 --> 00:29:44,180
If you're still mad at me,

731
00:29:44,180 --> 00:29:46,020
you can come at me.

732
00:29:46,100 --> 00:29:47,860
You can hit me
or tell me off all you like.

733
00:29:47,860 --> 00:29:49,220
I only managed to recover

734
00:29:49,220 --> 00:29:51,060
all thanks
to the chicken soup you made for me

735
00:29:51,060 --> 00:29:52,140
anyway.

736
00:29:52,140 --> 00:29:54,220
If you don't mind it,

737
00:29:54,220 --> 00:29:57,140
from now on,
I'll be a part of your family.

738
00:29:58,020 --> 00:29:58,660
Forget it.

739
00:29:58,660 --> 00:30:00,300
Don't flatter me like that.

740
00:30:00,300 --> 00:30:01,220
I can't stand it.

741
00:30:01,820 --> 00:30:03,620
I was just sharing some warmth with you.

742
00:30:03,780 --> 00:30:05,220
There's a blind old woman next door

743
00:30:05,420 --> 00:30:07,220
who has no children.

744
00:30:07,220 --> 00:30:09,020
We often deliver
chicken soup to her too.

745
00:30:09,580 --> 00:30:10,540
You...

746
00:30:10,540 --> 00:30:11,660
Please don't trouble yourself.

747
00:30:11,660 --> 00:30:12,900
Have some water.

748
00:30:12,910 --> 00:30:13,380
Please don't.

749
00:30:13,380 --> 00:30:14,260
Hey...

750
00:30:16,100 --> 00:30:16,780
Listen,

751
00:30:16,780 --> 00:30:18,500
you were just discharged not long ago.

752
00:30:20,180 --> 00:30:21,620
And, your son is getting married.

753
00:30:21,620 --> 00:30:22,820
You have to look after your body.

754
00:30:22,820 --> 00:30:24,120
- If not...
- She's right.

755
00:30:24,130 --> 00:30:25,180
- You have to look after yourself.
- Yeah.

756
00:30:25,180 --> 00:30:27,700
Xiu'e, you're right.

757
00:30:27,940 --> 00:30:29,380
How could you be this kind?

758
00:30:29,380 --> 00:30:30,980
To be honest, you're truly kind.

759
00:30:30,980 --> 00:30:34,300
You and your entire family are kind.

760
00:30:34,500 --> 00:30:35,660
You guys are so nice.

761
00:30:36,140 --> 00:30:36,940
Don't say that.

762
00:30:36,940 --> 00:30:37,820
Hey.

763
00:30:38,440 --> 00:30:39,340
It's almost lunchtime.

764
00:30:39,340 --> 00:30:40,620
You should stay for lunch.

765
00:30:40,620 --> 00:30:41,980
I'll tell Shen
to make something good for you.

766
00:30:41,980 --> 00:30:42,620
Yeah.

767
00:30:42,620 --> 00:30:43,460
Yeah, join us for lunch.

768
00:30:43,460 --> 00:30:44,700
No thanks.

769
00:30:44,700 --> 00:30:45,780
You guys are busy enough here.

770
00:30:45,780 --> 00:30:47,060
I mustn't cause
additional trouble for you two.

771
00:30:47,060 --> 00:30:47,700
I shouldn't.

772
00:30:47,700 --> 00:30:48,900
Shen is a great cook.

773
00:30:48,900 --> 00:30:50,420
It's fine. I'll make something for you.

774
00:30:50,420 --> 00:30:51,620
Just join us for lunch.

775
00:30:51,620 --> 00:30:52,340
That's not it.

776
00:30:52,350 --> 00:30:54,340
You see, I have plenty of
family matters to deal with.

777
00:30:54,340 --> 00:30:56,340
I have to finish them.

778
00:30:56,420 --> 00:30:56,980
So...

779
00:30:58,580 --> 00:31:01,460
Please attend the wedding.

780
00:31:02,140 --> 00:31:03,140
Sure. We'll be there.

781
00:31:03,460 --> 00:31:04,820
Yeah, we'll be there.

782
00:31:07,260 --> 00:31:08,220
Okay.

783
00:31:08,260 --> 00:31:09,780
Are you sure you don't want to join us?

784
00:31:09,780 --> 00:31:10,940
Yeah.

785
00:31:11,380 --> 00:31:12,620
Alright, then.

786
00:31:12,820 --> 00:31:13,980
Okay, I'll make a move first.

787
00:31:13,980 --> 00:31:14,820
Take care.

788
00:31:16,660 --> 00:31:17,580
She must be mentally sick.

789
00:31:17,580 --> 00:31:18,740
She was crying one minute
and laughing the next.

790
00:31:18,740 --> 00:31:19,540
I'm speechless.

791
00:31:20,540 --> 00:31:22,020
I'm so muddle-headed.

792
00:31:22,260 --> 00:31:25,060
I almost brought back
the wedding candies with me.

793
00:31:26,900 --> 00:31:28,100
Please attend their wedding.

794
00:31:28,420 --> 00:31:29,460
Please.

795
00:31:29,460 --> 00:31:29,980
We shall.

796
00:31:30,620 --> 00:31:31,940
Alright. Thank you.

797
00:31:32,460 --> 00:31:33,660
I'll thank you guys in advance.

798
00:31:34,320 --> 00:31:35,020
I'll be going now.

799
00:31:35,020 --> 00:31:35,780
Take care.

800
00:31:35,780 --> 00:31:36,220
Alright.

801
00:31:36,220 --> 00:31:37,020
Take care.

802
00:31:42,340 --> 00:31:43,170
My goodness.

803
00:31:46,500 --> 00:31:47,980
Did she receive the wrong blood type?

804
00:31:47,980 --> 00:31:48,930
Was that why she was acting weird?

805
00:31:48,940 --> 00:31:49,700
How dare you still laugh?

806
00:31:49,700 --> 00:31:50,660
She was acting abnormally.

807
00:31:50,660 --> 00:31:52,460
How could you still laugh?

808
00:31:52,470 --> 00:31:53,580
You actually laughed, huh?

809
00:31:53,580 --> 00:31:54,780
You're something else.

810
00:31:54,860 --> 00:31:56,620
Why would you stop
a guest at the entrance?

811
00:31:56,620 --> 00:31:57,620
Nobody does that.

812
00:31:57,620 --> 00:31:58,780
She...

813
00:31:58,860 --> 00:32:00,680
I invited her to
join us for lunch, didn't I?

814
00:32:01,540 --> 00:32:03,180
No one does it like that.

815
00:32:11,820 --> 00:32:13,900
You see, I think Yu Jingxiang

816
00:32:14,140 --> 00:32:15,580
is quite pitiful.

817
00:32:17,900 --> 00:32:19,180
You see, she just hoped

818
00:32:19,180 --> 00:32:21,100
that Mingzhu could call her Mom.

819
00:32:22,420 --> 00:32:23,540
Is that too much for you?

820
00:32:24,180 --> 00:32:25,100
What if it were you?

821
00:32:26,260 --> 00:32:28,820
What if you were in her shoes?

822
00:32:29,060 --> 00:32:29,920
What would you think?

823
00:32:30,260 --> 00:32:32,100
She was already feeling down.

824
00:32:32,180 --> 00:32:33,380
Even so, she humbled herself.

825
00:32:33,380 --> 00:32:35,700
She nodded and bowed to us.

826
00:32:36,300 --> 00:32:38,260
Even I thought that she was pitiful.

827
00:32:39,200 --> 00:32:40,100
Did you think Mingzhu

828
00:32:40,500 --> 00:32:41,860
would've wanted that to happen?

829
00:32:42,060 --> 00:32:43,660
Besides, she has evidence.

830
00:32:46,140 --> 00:32:48,060
She has plenty of evidence to prove

831
00:32:48,300 --> 00:32:49,540
that Mingzhu is her daughter.

832
00:32:50,220 --> 00:32:52,220
That's the reality.

833
00:32:52,460 --> 00:32:53,420
It's been so many years.

834
00:32:53,420 --> 00:32:55,580
There are some things
you should let go of.

835
00:32:55,580 --> 00:32:57,540
You have to face reality
when you should.

836
00:32:57,660 --> 00:32:59,500
You should let go of the past

837
00:32:59,740 --> 00:33:00,500
when you have to.

838
00:33:00,500 --> 00:33:01,860
Even she can figure that out.

839
00:33:01,860 --> 00:33:03,060
If we don't,

840
00:33:03,060 --> 00:33:04,860
we'll be insensible, you know?

841
00:33:06,180 --> 00:33:06,820
I mean,

842
00:33:06,820 --> 00:33:08,900
Mingzhu knows
the situation all too well.

843
00:33:08,900 --> 00:33:10,900
She doesn't want both families

844
00:33:11,060 --> 00:33:13,420
to fight for her

845
00:33:14,260 --> 00:33:16,180
and be at odds forever.

846
00:33:19,420 --> 00:33:21,460
To help others is to help ourselves.

847
00:33:22,380 --> 00:33:23,140
The main thing is,

848
00:33:25,740 --> 00:33:27,460
you'll be helping
our daughter out as well.

849
00:33:33,780 --> 00:33:35,740
(Auspiciousness)

850
00:33:35,740 --> 00:33:39,580
(Bliss)

851
00:33:40,780 --> 00:33:41,540
Class monitor!

852
00:33:41,620 --> 00:33:42,700
Hello, guys!

853
00:33:43,020 --> 00:33:44,420
- You guys are late.
- Congratulations.

854
00:33:44,420 --> 00:33:45,900
Thank you so much.

855
00:33:46,020 --> 00:33:47,300
Hurry and take a picture for us.

856
00:33:47,300 --> 00:33:48,140
- Let's take a picture.
- Come.

857
00:33:48,140 --> 00:33:49,460
Look here. Get ready.

858
00:33:49,460 --> 00:33:51,140
Look here. Three, two, one.

859
00:33:51,140 --> 00:33:51,820
One more.

860
00:33:51,820 --> 00:33:52,460
Over here.

861
00:33:52,460 --> 00:33:53,620
Here. Smile. Look at me.

862
00:33:53,620 --> 00:33:55,460
Here. Three, two, one.

863
00:33:55,980 --> 00:33:56,620
Excellent.

864
00:33:57,060 --> 00:33:57,820
Wait.

865
00:33:57,820 --> 00:33:58,940
Let me record a video
and post it in my Moments.

866
00:33:58,940 --> 00:33:59,780
Okay.

867
00:33:59,780 --> 00:34:01,260
On the count of three,
say "Happy wedding".

868
00:34:01,260 --> 00:34:01,780
Okay.

869
00:34:01,780 --> 00:34:03,940
Come. Three, two, one.

870
00:34:04,060 --> 00:34:06,620
- Happy wedding!
- Happy wedding!

871
00:34:07,140 --> 00:34:09,580
Dear aunts, you two looked phenomenal!

872
00:34:09,580 --> 00:34:10,380
Uncle.

873
00:34:11,140 --> 00:34:12,620
Enjoy yourselves later, okay?

874
00:34:12,700 --> 00:34:13,900
This liquor is pretty good.

875
00:34:15,540 --> 00:34:16,060
Wait.

876
00:34:16,060 --> 00:34:17,420
What are you two doing?

877
00:34:18,020 --> 00:34:21,100
Your daughter insists on experiencing
what it feels like to get married.

878
00:34:21,120 --> 00:34:23,460
You think I don't want to experience
the feeling of getting married again?

879
00:34:23,540 --> 00:34:24,700
Hurry and get down.

880
00:34:24,900 --> 00:34:26,380
Be careful. Over here.

881
00:34:27,180 --> 00:34:27,930
Please head inside.

882
00:34:27,940 --> 00:34:29,100
- Take care.
- Please head inside.

883
00:34:29,100 --> 00:34:29,660
Alright.

884
00:34:30,900 --> 00:34:31,420
This is nice.

885
00:34:31,420 --> 00:34:32,180
Mr. Shen.

886
00:34:33,580 --> 00:34:34,180
Welcome.

887
00:34:35,180 --> 00:34:36,380
Our VIPs have arrived.

888
00:34:36,980 --> 00:34:38,540
Our VIPs have arrived.

889
00:34:38,700 --> 00:34:39,420
Congratulations.

890
00:34:39,440 --> 00:34:40,180
Thank you so much.

891
00:34:40,180 --> 00:34:40,820
Congratulations.

892
00:34:40,820 --> 00:34:41,980
Thank you, Mrs. Shen.

893
00:34:42,060 --> 00:34:42,620
Don't do it.

894
00:34:42,620 --> 00:34:43,460
This is from me.

895
00:34:43,460 --> 00:34:44,300
Don't do it.

896
00:34:44,300 --> 00:34:45,180
- This won't do.
- Mingzhu.

897
00:34:45,180 --> 00:34:46,140
I already have my own family.

898
00:34:46,140 --> 00:34:47,330
I should contribute one as well.

899
00:34:47,340 --> 00:34:48,420
They shouldn't give us twice.

900
00:34:48,420 --> 00:34:49,900
Listen to me.

901
00:34:50,020 --> 00:34:52,060
We're already happy enough
that you guys are here.

902
00:34:52,070 --> 00:34:53,260
We're a family. Don't do this.

903
00:34:53,260 --> 00:34:54,420
Stop being stubborn.

904
00:34:54,420 --> 00:34:55,260
It's not for you anyway.

905
00:34:55,260 --> 00:34:56,180
Congratulations.

906
00:34:57,060 --> 00:34:57,900
Thank you, Mrs. Shen.

907
00:34:57,900 --> 00:34:58,700
Thank you, Mingzhu.

908
00:34:58,710 --> 00:34:59,900
You two must stay happy, okay?

909
00:34:59,900 --> 00:35:01,060
May you have a child soon.

910
00:35:01,060 --> 00:35:01,820
Thank you so much.

911
00:35:01,820 --> 00:35:03,940
So, where's the toilet?

912
00:35:04,460 --> 00:35:05,340
It's over there.

913
00:35:05,350 --> 00:35:06,540
- I need to use the toilet.
- Mom, I'll join you.

914
00:35:06,540 --> 00:35:07,500
I'll be fine. You can stay here.

915
00:35:07,500 --> 00:35:08,180
I'll be back in a second.

916
00:35:08,180 --> 00:35:09,380
I drank too much water just now.

917
00:35:09,380 --> 00:35:10,340
I need to take a leak.

918
00:35:10,780 --> 00:35:11,700
Take care.

919
00:35:13,860 --> 00:35:14,820
Mingzhu, you're here.

920
00:35:15,300 --> 00:35:16,020
Zhixia.

921
00:35:16,020 --> 00:35:16,860
Mingzhu.

922
00:35:17,540 --> 00:35:18,340
You're so beautiful.

923
00:35:19,180 --> 00:35:19,860
Mr. Shen.

924
00:35:20,380 --> 00:35:22,260
We're truly honored by your presence.

925
00:35:22,320 --> 00:35:23,620
Didn't Mrs. Shen come as well?

926
00:35:23,620 --> 00:35:24,420
She's here.

927
00:35:24,420 --> 00:35:25,460
She went to the toilet.

928
00:35:25,460 --> 00:35:26,490
Is your younger brother
in the toilet too?

929
00:35:26,500 --> 00:35:27,100
No.

930
00:35:27,100 --> 00:35:28,950
He's studying at home
to prepare for the NCEE.

931
00:35:28,980 --> 00:35:30,300
- Mingzhu.
- That's good to hear.

932
00:35:30,300 --> 00:35:32,180
How are you doing?

933
00:35:32,180 --> 00:35:33,060
I'm doing great.

934
00:35:33,060 --> 00:35:34,220
It's just that my child
is growing rapidly.

935
00:35:34,220 --> 00:35:35,140
Isn't that great? Look at me.

936
00:35:35,140 --> 00:35:36,140
Yeah.

937
00:35:37,100 --> 00:35:37,700
Oh yeah.

938
00:35:37,700 --> 00:35:39,020
Photographer, please help us

939
00:35:39,100 --> 00:35:40,700
take a family picture.

940
00:35:40,760 --> 00:35:41,860
- Yeah.
- I'll go and look for Mom.

941
00:35:41,860 --> 00:35:43,620
Mr. Shen, come and join us.

942
00:35:43,620 --> 00:35:44,860
No. I'll go and look for her.

943
00:35:44,860 --> 00:35:45,260
You?

944
00:35:45,260 --> 00:35:46,130
Take the family picture.

945
00:35:46,140 --> 00:35:46,580
Let's take one first.

946
00:35:46,580 --> 00:35:47,220
You guys can go ahead.

947
00:35:47,220 --> 00:35:48,460
Alright. We'll take one first.

948
00:35:48,460 --> 00:35:49,460
Okay. Come.

949
00:35:49,460 --> 00:35:51,020
Okay. Come here, dear.

950
00:35:51,020 --> 00:35:52,460
Look at me.

951
00:35:53,460 --> 00:35:54,180
Look at me.

952
00:35:54,180 --> 00:35:55,580
Three, two, one.

953
00:35:55,580 --> 00:35:56,140
Cheese.

954
00:35:56,460 --> 00:35:57,300
I'm the only one doing it.

955
00:35:57,300 --> 00:35:57,860
Come on, let's do it.

956
00:35:57,860 --> 00:35:59,180
Okay.

957
00:35:59,180 --> 00:36:00,060
Let's take one more. Smile.

958
00:36:00,060 --> 00:36:01,900
It's a family picture. Three, two, one.

959
00:36:01,900 --> 00:36:03,940
- Cheese!
- Cheese!

960
00:36:04,380 --> 00:36:05,100
Alright.

961
00:36:05,580 --> 00:36:06,100
Okay.

962
00:36:06,100 --> 00:36:06,660
Hey.

963
00:36:06,660 --> 00:36:06,980
Mom.

964
00:36:06,980 --> 00:36:07,900
That doesn't count.

965
00:36:07,900 --> 00:36:09,420
Mom, let's take a family picture.

966
00:36:09,420 --> 00:36:10,180
Yeah.

967
00:36:10,180 --> 00:36:11,820
They're taking a family picture.

968
00:36:11,900 --> 00:36:12,580
Yeah.

969
00:36:12,580 --> 00:36:14,100
We aren't a family.
Why are we joining them?

970
00:36:14,100 --> 00:36:14,860
Mrs. Shen.

971
00:36:15,260 --> 00:36:17,300
Join us for a family picture.

972
00:36:17,940 --> 00:36:18,900
It's okay.

973
00:36:18,900 --> 00:36:19,850
The auspicious hour is nearing.

974
00:36:19,860 --> 00:36:21,820
Friends and family,
please take your seats.

975
00:36:21,820 --> 00:36:22,220
Yeah.

976
00:36:22,220 --> 00:36:23,860
It's almost time.
We should proceed first.

977
00:36:23,870 --> 00:36:24,900
We can talk about the photo later.

978
00:36:24,900 --> 00:36:25,700
Let's observe the ceremony first.

979
00:36:25,700 --> 00:36:26,380
Was she upset?

980
00:36:26,380 --> 00:36:26,700
No.

981
00:36:26,900 --> 00:36:28,580
We reserved the VIP seats for you all.

982
00:36:28,580 --> 00:36:30,180
Please take your seats.

983
00:36:30,300 --> 00:36:32,140
Come. Please take your seats.

984
00:36:38,560 --> 00:36:40,550
The bride's father is
holding his daughter's hands,

985
00:36:41,060 --> 00:36:43,300
from her first day of school
to her wedding day...

986
00:36:51,700 --> 00:36:53,100
(Just a few months ago,)

987
00:36:53,820 --> 00:36:56,020
(I've imagined this scene
countless times.)

988
00:36:56,740 --> 00:36:59,100
(I discussed
how I should walk the aisle)

989
00:36:59,620 --> 00:37:01,980
(with my father
on my wedding day countless times.)

990
00:37:01,990 --> 00:37:03,100
(I pondered how to smile)

991
00:37:03,180 --> 00:37:05,260
(or how I should extend my arm
to my future husband.)

992
00:37:05,740 --> 00:37:06,700
(But now,)

993
00:37:07,420 --> 00:37:08,940
(my husband is no longer around.)

994
00:37:22,740 --> 00:37:25,020
Let's take a breather outside.

995
00:37:25,500 --> 00:37:26,340
Mom, I'm fine.

996
00:37:26,620 --> 00:37:28,020
I'm just touched

997
00:37:28,020 --> 00:37:29,300
that they're getting married.

998
00:37:29,860 --> 00:37:30,700
I'm fine.

999
00:37:31,620 --> 00:37:32,260
Look.

1000
00:37:32,620 --> 00:37:33,180
Groom,

1001
00:37:33,460 --> 00:37:35,580
you may come and embrace happiness now.

1002
00:37:43,060 --> 00:37:45,980
I know that the bride's father

1003
00:37:46,140 --> 00:37:47,860
must be reluctant to part with her.

1004
00:37:48,180 --> 00:37:49,260
But at this moment,

1005
00:37:49,260 --> 00:37:51,500
you still have
a sacred mission to complete.

1006
00:37:51,760 --> 00:37:53,460
Please give
your precious daughter, Bichen,

1007
00:37:53,460 --> 00:37:55,380
into the care of her groom,
Mr. Xu Zhidong,

1008
00:37:55,900 --> 00:37:57,980
to complete the passing
and continuation of love.

1009
00:38:14,180 --> 00:38:15,620
Bride's father, please open your arms

1010
00:38:16,060 --> 00:38:17,380
and embrace the newlywed.

1011
00:38:34,060 --> 00:38:35,020
Sorry about this.

1012
00:38:35,620 --> 00:38:36,420
Host,

1013
00:38:36,740 --> 00:38:38,380
actually, it's not time

1014
00:38:38,380 --> 00:38:40,020
for my speech yet.

1015
00:38:41,140 --> 00:38:43,220
You see, I already prepared a script

1016
00:38:43,220 --> 00:38:44,180
for my speech.

1017
00:38:44,820 --> 00:38:45,500
But now,

1018
00:38:46,020 --> 00:38:47,820
I'm suddenly inspired.

1019
00:38:48,300 --> 00:38:51,020
I wish to say something
to everyone here.

1020
00:38:55,060 --> 00:38:57,180
The pictures of us

1021
00:38:57,180 --> 00:38:58,660
on the screen

1022
00:38:59,380 --> 00:39:01,540
were all happy and joyous moments.

1023
00:39:02,540 --> 00:39:04,020
But that isn't all.

1024
00:39:05,540 --> 00:39:07,780
We do have misunderstandings, conflicts,

1025
00:39:08,500 --> 00:39:10,260
and arguments too.

1026
00:39:12,100 --> 00:39:13,580
But just like what everyone says,

1027
00:39:14,360 --> 00:39:16,220
it's precisely
because of these disappointments

1028
00:39:16,220 --> 00:39:17,820
and these moments of happiness

1029
00:39:18,380 --> 00:39:20,140
that we become whole.

1030
00:39:21,300 --> 00:39:22,540
With these disappointments,

1031
00:39:23,380 --> 00:39:25,280
the moments of happiness
become extra precious.

1032
00:39:25,540 --> 00:39:26,820
With these disappointments,

1033
00:39:27,300 --> 00:39:28,820
Chen and I were able to

1034
00:39:29,420 --> 00:39:31,340
understand and trust each other more.

1035
00:39:33,620 --> 00:39:35,540
With these disappointments,

1036
00:39:36,540 --> 00:39:40,340
I was truly able
to understand the meaning of home.

1037
00:39:43,780 --> 00:39:46,940
Though great kindness
need not be thanked,

1038
00:39:50,140 --> 00:39:52,020
Dad, Mom,

1039
00:39:54,580 --> 00:39:55,380
and Zhixia,

1040
00:39:57,340 --> 00:39:58,740
thank you for your love.

1041
00:40:00,940 --> 00:40:03,140
I will use the rest of my life
to repay your kindness.

1042
00:40:04,780 --> 00:40:05,500
Thank you.

1043
00:40:18,780 --> 00:40:21,180
From today onward, Chen and I

1044
00:40:21,180 --> 00:40:22,660
will also establish our own family.

1045
00:40:23,260 --> 00:40:24,780
I have something to tell Chen.

1046
00:40:27,500 --> 00:40:28,220
Chen,

1047
00:40:29,380 --> 00:40:30,820
you have to be mentally prepared.

1048
00:40:31,660 --> 00:40:33,340
Today might be the most wonderful day

1049
00:40:33,340 --> 00:40:34,780
of your life.

1050
00:40:35,180 --> 00:40:37,340
After this, you will face
a ten-month pregnancy.

1051
00:40:37,520 --> 00:40:39,950
You will give birth to our children,
and you have to raise them.

1052
00:40:39,980 --> 00:40:41,020
You will gain weight,

1053
00:40:41,020 --> 00:40:42,140
you will get stretch marks,

1054
00:40:42,140 --> 00:40:44,750
and you will be so busy that
you have no time to doll yourself up.

1055
00:40:46,020 --> 00:40:48,020
No. What I'm trying to say is

1056
00:40:48,020 --> 00:40:50,140
that you're always be beautiful to me!

1057
00:40:52,180 --> 00:40:53,260
I wish to say this to you.

1058
00:40:54,660 --> 00:40:56,380
Thank you so much
for everything you did.

1059
00:40:59,700 --> 00:41:03,460
Today,
I will announce this to the world!

1060
00:41:04,020 --> 00:41:05,020
Yuan Bichen,

1061
00:41:05,300 --> 00:41:06,540
I love you!

1062
00:41:06,900 --> 00:41:08,860
Excellent!

1063
00:41:09,860 --> 00:41:10,340
Excellent!

1064
00:41:23,000 --> 00:41:24,580
There's one more person I need to thank.

1065
00:41:25,500 --> 00:41:26,540
Without her,

1066
00:41:27,340 --> 00:41:29,060
our child wouldn't have survived.

1067
00:41:29,380 --> 00:41:31,140
And, we wouldn't be standing here.

1068
00:41:31,820 --> 00:41:33,340
I need to thank my second sister,

1069
00:41:34,780 --> 00:41:35,420
Shen Mingzhu.

1070
00:41:36,840 --> 00:41:37,620
You didn't need to.

1071
00:41:38,620 --> 00:41:39,260
Mingzhu,

1072
00:41:39,360 --> 00:41:41,660
no matter if you acknowledge me
as your brother or not,

1073
00:41:41,700 --> 00:41:43,020
to me,

1074
00:41:43,020 --> 00:41:44,500
we are twins,

1075
00:41:44,500 --> 00:41:45,860
who are bound by blood.

1076
00:41:46,780 --> 00:41:47,740
Please come on stage

1077
00:41:47,740 --> 00:41:49,100
and be our officiant.

1078
00:41:49,420 --> 00:41:50,540
Please give us a speech.

1079
00:41:50,900 --> 00:41:52,060
What's going on?

1080
00:41:52,660 --> 00:41:53,700
What did he mean by that?

1081
00:41:53,940 --> 00:41:55,820
I thought they said
that they would drop the matter.

1082
00:41:56,060 --> 00:41:59,060
It's obvious that they're trying
to acknowledge you through this wedding.

1083
00:42:01,060 --> 00:42:03,260
The groom's speech was truly touching.

1084
00:42:04,060 --> 00:42:06,300
And, Mingzhu
is her parents' precious daughter.

1085
00:42:06,300 --> 00:42:08,940
She's also the guiding pearl
for our newlywed couple.

1086
00:42:09,620 --> 00:42:11,180
Since she's very important,

1087
00:42:11,180 --> 00:42:13,530
and she wants to give her blessings
to the newlywed couple,

1088
00:42:13,540 --> 00:42:14,100
here,

1089
00:42:14,100 --> 00:42:16,420
I would like to make a request.

1090
00:42:16,780 --> 00:42:17,700
Everyone knows

1091
00:42:17,700 --> 00:42:19,580
that Mingzhu is an excellent pianist.

1092
00:42:19,780 --> 00:42:21,220
Action speaks louder than words.

1093
00:42:21,300 --> 00:42:23,340
Next, let us give a big hand

1094
00:42:23,340 --> 00:42:24,900
to Mrs. Shen Mingzhu.

1095
00:42:24,900 --> 00:42:26,020
Please play a song for us,

1096
00:42:26,020 --> 00:42:26,660
okay?

1097
00:42:27,900 --> 00:42:29,500
Excellent!

1098
00:42:33,520 --> 00:42:34,540
Why are you sitting down?

1099
00:42:34,540 --> 00:42:35,460
What did I tell you?

1100
00:42:35,460 --> 00:42:36,420
We shouldn't have come here
in the first place!

1101
00:42:36,420 --> 00:42:38,500
They're in the middle of their wedding.

1102
00:42:38,500 --> 00:42:39,100
For this moment...

1103
00:42:39,100 --> 00:42:40,700
But he did it on purpose!
