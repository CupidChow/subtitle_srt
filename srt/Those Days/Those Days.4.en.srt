00:01:12,431 --> 00:01:14,800
(Adapted from iceread.com novel
"You Xi" by Qingyang Wanxi)

00:01:15,220 --> 00:01:17,740
=Episode 4=

4
00:01:19,319 --> 00:01:20,360
Morning, uncle.

5
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:31,520
Jianqi.

6
00:01:31,520 --> 00:01:32,080
Go ahead.

7
00:01:32,080 --> 00:01:32,540
It's fine.

8
00:01:32,540 --> 00:01:33,360
I'm good, Jianqi.

9
00:01:33,360 --> 00:01:34,319
You go ahead and brush.

10
00:01:34,319 --> 00:01:35,360
I'll wait for you.

11
00:01:35,360 --> 00:01:36,440
No need, Jianqi.

12
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:38,000
Come.

13
00:01:38,520 --> 00:01:39,520
Here.

14
00:01:45,479 --> 00:01:46,919
Please, Jianqi.

15
00:01:47,479 --> 00:01:48,119
Please.

16
00:01:50,880 --> 00:01:51,839
Go ahead, brush.

17
00:01:52,040 --> 00:01:53,199
Here, I'll hold it for you.

18
00:01:53,319 --> 00:01:54,479
No, that's fine.

19
00:01:55,039 --> 00:01:55,839
You brush.

20
00:01:56,399 --> 00:01:57,240
Shen Minghui.

21
00:01:57,960 --> 00:01:59,650
The sun must be rising
in the west today.

22
00:02:00,399 --> 00:02:01,119
Jianqi.

23
00:02:01,479 --> 00:02:02,759
You're such a straight guy.

24
00:02:03,119 --> 00:02:03,880
A solid one.

25
00:02:05,160 --> 00:02:06,479
I almost want to marry you.

26
00:02:07,679 --> 00:02:09,240
That… That's not necessary.

27
00:02:09,600 --> 00:02:10,399
No need.

28
00:02:10,679 --> 00:02:11,399
Keep brushing.

29
00:02:15,640 --> 00:02:16,640
I'll leave you to it.

30
00:02:17,080 --> 00:02:17,800
Suit yourself.

31
00:02:18,250 --> 00:02:19,800
Call me if you need anything, Jianqi.

32
00:02:20,599 --> 00:02:21,399
See you later.

33
00:02:44,279 --> 00:02:45,999
Jianqi, breakfast's ready.

34
00:02:46,839 --> 00:02:47,480
Coming.

35
00:02:52,620 --> 00:02:53,480
Where are Mom and Dad?

36
00:02:53,480 --> 00:02:54,719
They went grocery shopping.

37
00:02:55,210 --> 00:02:57,250
We've got an ultrasound
appointment this afternoon.

38
00:02:57,279 --> 00:02:58,360
No need to pick me up.

39
00:02:58,360 --> 00:02:59,920
We'll meet at the hospital.

40
00:03:00,879 --> 00:03:01,480
Okay.

41
00:03:02,760 --> 00:03:03,439
Jianqi.

42
00:03:04,999 --> 00:03:05,599
Here.

43
00:03:05,999 --> 00:03:07,360
Drink it on your way to work.

44
00:03:12,839 --> 00:03:13,439
Mingzhu.

45
00:03:14,279 --> 00:03:17,279
Your brother's
being unusually friendly today.

46
00:03:17,559 --> 00:03:19,240
He's not up to something again, is he?

47
00:03:19,240 --> 00:03:20,360
I'm a little worried.

48
00:03:21,640 --> 00:03:22,559
I guess no.

49
00:03:23,559 --> 00:03:25,879
Just use last night's energy
to put him in his place.

50
00:03:25,980 --> 00:03:30,999
(Parking lot)

51
00:03:30,999 --> 00:03:31,679
Maodou.

52
00:03:31,999 --> 00:03:34,320
Although this company makes liquor,

53
00:03:34,320 --> 00:03:35,999
its style is actually very clear-headed.

54
00:03:36,279 --> 00:03:37,200
So the two of us

55
00:03:37,279 --> 00:03:38,439
need to stay composed.

56
00:03:38,439 --> 00:03:39,399
No exaggerating.

57
00:03:39,960 --> 00:03:42,119
Now you're making me nervous.

58
00:03:42,119 --> 00:03:44,559
If we don't hype it up,
how do we get the ad deal?

59
00:03:44,559 --> 00:03:46,240
You're missing my point again.

60
00:03:46,240 --> 00:03:47,279
Not no hype,

61
00:03:47,279 --> 00:03:48,999
but measured hype.

62
00:03:49,679 --> 00:03:50,640
Learn well.

63
00:03:50,800 --> 00:03:51,760
Keep improving.

64
00:03:57,439 --> 00:03:58,480
Zhixia, you okay?

65
00:03:59,999 --> 00:04:03,679
I'll find a store nearby, get you some
water from a supermarket or something.

66
00:04:07,879 --> 00:04:08,480
No need.

67
00:04:10,839 --> 00:04:11,679
Work comes first.

68
00:04:28,550 --> 00:04:29,279
Slow down, Zhixia.

69
00:04:29,279 --> 00:04:29,839
I'm fine.

70
00:04:41,239 --> 00:04:41,919
Hello.

71
00:04:43,080 --> 00:04:43,640
Hello.

72
00:04:43,640 --> 00:04:44,719
Are you Mr. Lu?

73
00:04:46,440 --> 00:04:48,279
Hello, let me introduce myself.

74
00:04:48,560 --> 00:04:50,239
I'm Xu Zhixia.

75
00:04:50,919 --> 00:04:53,000
I'm an editor at the supplement
of the Nanzhou Daily.

76
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:54,239
Do you have a moment to talk?

77
00:04:55,359 --> 00:04:56,159
Please, have a seat.

78
00:04:59,160 --> 00:05:00,120
Here's the thing, Mr. Lu.

79
00:05:00,120 --> 00:05:01,799
I used to be an editor.

80
00:05:02,260 --> 00:05:03,760
Later, I started my own public account

81
00:05:03,760 --> 00:05:05,039
called "Zhixia Speaks."

82
00:05:06,159 --> 00:05:08,080
We focus on women's self-growth.

83
00:05:08,090 --> 00:05:09,760
Currently, we have
over 200,000 followers.

84
00:05:10,719 --> 00:05:12,239
And three local communities.

85
00:05:13,680 --> 00:05:15,200
Our offline events

86
00:05:15,200 --> 00:05:16,279
are always quite popular.

87
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:21,520
I'm in the liquor business.

88
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:24,479
You just mentioned that Zhixia...

89
00:05:24,479 --> 00:05:25,320
"Zhixia Speaks."

90
00:05:25,839 --> 00:05:27,880
That's aimed at women, right?

91
00:05:28,520 --> 00:05:30,159
So where exactly do we overlap?

92
00:05:30,760 --> 00:05:32,080
Women drink liquor too.

93
00:05:33,560 --> 00:05:34,399
And when men drink,

94
00:05:34,399 --> 00:05:35,080
don't they often

95
00:05:35,080 --> 00:05:36,440
have to check in with their wives

96
00:05:36,440 --> 00:05:38,000
or girlfriends first?

97
00:05:38,960 --> 00:05:39,520
That's true.

98
00:05:39,719 --> 00:05:42,120
My dad's liquor is all bought by my mom.

99
00:05:42,120 --> 00:05:44,960
In most households,
women manage the money.

100
00:05:44,960 --> 00:05:47,159
So they care more about quality.

101
00:05:47,159 --> 00:05:49,159
Exactly. My mom always says

102
00:05:49,159 --> 00:05:51,080
the liquor she buys for my dad

103
00:05:51,080 --> 00:05:52,839
is all pure grain liquor.

104
00:05:53,080 --> 00:05:53,919
Pure grain, huh?

105
00:05:54,159 --> 00:05:55,719
That's exactly what we produce.

106
00:05:56,320 --> 00:05:58,320
That's why we're here today,
to pay our respects.

107
00:06:01,279 --> 00:06:03,279
I actually did a survey at our company.

108
00:06:03,719 --> 00:06:04,670
Across all departments,

109
00:06:04,680 --> 00:06:07,279
it's always the moms who buy the liquor
and the dads who drink it.

110
00:06:07,279 --> 00:06:09,050
That's why we have confidence today

111
00:06:09,050 --> 00:06:10,960
to sit here
and talk about advertising with you.

112
00:06:12,680 --> 00:06:14,239
Even in my family,

113
00:06:14,279 --> 00:06:15,950
my mom decides
what liquor my dad drinks.

114
00:06:19,799 --> 00:06:21,719
The Past and Present of Rufeng Liquor.

115
00:06:21,719 --> 00:06:22,700
(Project Proposal)

116
00:06:23,159 --> 00:06:24,520
I like this concept.

117
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:26,860
Here's what we'll do.

118
00:06:30,170 --> 00:06:32,200
Let's start with fifty thousand yuan
and see how it goes.

119
00:06:32,200 --> 00:06:32,880
How's that sound?

120
00:06:34,520 --> 00:06:35,839
Thank you for your trust, Mr. Lu.

121
00:06:35,960 --> 00:06:37,279
But just to be clear,

122
00:06:37,520 --> 00:06:39,000
the article must be well written.

123
00:06:39,440 --> 00:06:40,960
Liquor is culture, after all.

124
00:06:40,960 --> 00:06:42,110
Please rest assured, Mr. Lu.

125
00:06:42,479 --> 00:06:44,640
Your company's article
will be written entirely by me.

126
00:06:44,960 --> 00:06:46,159
I'll go there myself,

127
00:06:46,399 --> 00:06:47,880
and write every word by myself.

128
00:06:47,880 --> 00:06:48,440
Good.

129
00:06:50,050 --> 00:06:51,450
Pleasure working with you, Mr. Lu.

130
00:06:53,880 --> 00:06:54,719
"Don't worry.

131
00:06:55,039 --> 00:06:57,640
Your company's article
will be written entirely by me.

132
00:06:58,320 --> 00:07:00,239
You know, in our company..."

133
00:07:00,359 --> 00:07:02,960
Zhixia, in our company,
there's literally just the two of us.

134
00:07:02,960 --> 00:07:05,440
But you managed to hyped it up
like it's a Fortune 500 company.

135
00:07:05,799 --> 00:07:06,520
Almost there.

136
00:07:06,919 --> 00:07:08,960
That's how
Fortune 500 company get started.

137
00:07:09,799 --> 00:07:11,680
Go back and organize all the info

138
00:07:11,680 --> 00:07:12,399
and reviews

139
00:07:12,399 --> 00:07:13,560
about Rufeng Liquor.

140
00:07:13,560 --> 00:07:15,440
I'll turn them
into a Fortune 500 story first.

141
00:07:15,440 --> 00:07:16,520
No problem.

142
00:07:17,220 --> 00:07:18,719
Zhixia, you're gonna throw up again?

143
00:07:22,239 --> 00:07:24,120
It's fine. I swallowed it back.

144
00:07:26,460 --> 00:07:28,000
Haven't even decided whether to keep it,

145
00:07:28,010 --> 00:07:29,910
and this little one's
already giving me trouble.

146
00:07:30,080 --> 00:07:31,159
Why wouldn't you keep it?

147
00:07:32,039 --> 00:07:32,960
You gonna raise it?

148
00:07:35,120 --> 00:07:35,719
Zhixia.

149
00:07:37,960 --> 00:07:38,919
Look at all these ribs.

150
00:07:38,919 --> 00:07:39,960
That's a lot of ribs.

151
00:07:40,960 --> 00:07:42,919
- And bamboo shoots too.
- And bamboo shoots too.

152
00:07:48,560 --> 00:07:50,640
I brought two pieces of ribs today.

153
00:07:51,520 --> 00:07:54,000
But I'm afraid
I can't share them this time.

154
00:07:54,599 --> 00:07:55,799
So stingy.

155
00:07:55,810 --> 00:07:57,760
- You've got so much there.
- Yeah, don't be so cheap.

156
00:07:57,760 --> 00:07:59,039
It's not about being stingy.

157
00:08:00,159 --> 00:08:01,279
My brother-in-law

158
00:08:01,279 --> 00:08:02,919
packed this lunch box.

159
00:08:03,279 --> 00:08:04,120
There could even be

160
00:08:05,200 --> 00:08:06,200
a laxative in there.

161
00:08:07,450 --> 00:08:08,560
That's fine, I'm not scared.

162
00:08:08,560 --> 00:08:09,239
Here, have some of mine.

163
00:08:09,239 --> 00:08:09,940
Come on, everyone.

164
00:08:09,950 --> 00:08:11,320
Grab some food over here.

165
00:08:14,239 --> 00:08:14,560
Here.

166
00:08:15,039 --> 00:08:16,359
Eat mine, go ahead.

167
00:08:18,080 --> 00:08:19,399
- Tastes amazing.
- Really good.

168
00:08:20,279 --> 00:08:21,760
You're all ready to die for food, huh?

169
00:08:40,919 --> 00:08:41,680
Shen Mingzhu.

170
00:08:43,359 --> 00:08:44,040
Mrs. Feng.

171
00:08:44,560 --> 00:08:45,599
I'd like a word with you.

172
00:08:46,040 --> 00:08:47,759
I'm working right now.

173
00:08:47,879 --> 00:08:48,999
Then I'll keep it brief.

174
00:08:50,479 --> 00:08:52,560
Your Nanxi Hotel
is really disappointing.

175
00:08:52,680 --> 00:08:53,879
No air conditioning at all.

176
00:08:54,040 --> 00:08:56,040
How can you compete
with Xincheng Hotel like this?

177
00:08:57,400 --> 00:08:58,560
Go assign the rooms first.

178
00:08:58,560 --> 00:08:59,440
I'll be right there.

179
00:08:59,440 --> 00:08:59,800
Okay.

180
00:09:06,119 --> 00:09:06,759
Sit down.

181
00:09:07,479 --> 00:09:09,680
No need, I still have work to finish.

182
00:09:10,920 --> 00:09:12,879
I took the car back.

183
00:09:13,359 --> 00:09:15,239
I paid for it, so that's only fair.

184
00:09:18,119 --> 00:09:19,519
That watch looks expensive.

185
00:09:19,759 --> 00:09:21,560
Feng Jianqi bought it
for you, didn't he?

186
00:09:22,239 --> 00:09:23,320
Are you taking it back too?

187
00:09:23,400 --> 00:09:24,440
No, that's not necessary.

188
00:09:25,400 --> 00:09:26,280
You can keep it.

189
00:09:26,660 --> 00:09:29,160
I came to see you today
because I wanted to tell you something.

190
00:09:29,160 --> 00:09:30,639
Our Feng Jianqi

191
00:09:30,639 --> 00:09:32,680
has been spoiled since he was a child.

192
00:09:32,680 --> 00:09:34,920
He's used to wearing
designer brands everywhere he goes.

193
00:09:35,119 --> 00:09:37,119
Now that he's moved into your old house

194
00:09:37,119 --> 00:09:38,800
and is even riding a shared bike,

195
00:09:38,920 --> 00:09:40,639
the novelty will only last a few days.

196
00:09:40,639 --> 00:09:42,560
Soon he'll realize
how uncomfortable it is.

197
00:09:43,040 --> 00:09:43,920
You don't believe me?

198
00:09:44,359 --> 00:09:45,519
I wouldn't know.

199
00:09:46,879 --> 00:09:48,639
Of course you don't.

200
00:09:49,239 --> 00:09:51,040
Families like ours

201
00:09:51,479 --> 00:09:54,239
can't help it,
we simply have too much wealth.

202
00:09:56,119 --> 00:09:57,639
Jianqi moving into your place

203
00:09:57,639 --> 00:10:00,040
is nothing more
than a little exercise in humility.

204
00:10:00,680 --> 00:10:02,999
Do you really think, in the end,

205
00:10:02,999 --> 00:10:04,239
he would choose you or me?

206
00:10:05,999 --> 00:10:06,680
Mrs. Feng,

207
00:10:06,999 --> 00:10:08,359
you're Jianqi's mother.

208
00:10:08,519 --> 00:10:10,119
And I'm the mother of Jianqi's child.

209
00:10:10,359 --> 00:10:11,759
If you make him choose,

210
00:10:11,760 --> 00:10:13,360
you'll only make things harder for him.

211
00:10:14,200 --> 00:10:15,080
You stubborn girl,

212
00:10:15,080 --> 00:10:16,479
why won't you listen to reason?

213
00:10:16,479 --> 00:10:18,759
Didn't you hear
a single word I just said?

214
00:10:20,360 --> 00:10:21,280
Fine, have it your way.

215
00:10:21,519 --> 00:10:24,320
Tell Feng Jianqi, he doesn't
need to feel torn anymore.

216
00:10:24,320 --> 00:10:25,479
And tell his father

217
00:10:25,479 --> 00:10:26,999
to stop trying to persuade me.

218
00:10:27,080 --> 00:10:28,639
I'm done with this son.

219
00:10:28,759 --> 00:10:30,879
And his son, he has nothing
to do with me either.

220
00:10:30,879 --> 00:10:32,359
You can both live your own lives.

221
00:10:42,599 --> 00:10:43,719
Unlocking successful.

222
00:10:44,040 --> 00:10:46,879
To lock and return,
please operate through the app.

223
00:11:01,479 --> 00:11:03,400
Jianqi, where are you?

224
00:11:03,410 --> 00:11:05,730
I'm waiting for you at the outside
of the ultrasound room.

225
00:11:10,320 --> 00:11:12,160
Number 32, Shen Mingzhu,

226
00:11:12,160 --> 00:11:13,680
please go to examination room nine.

227
00:11:18,879 --> 00:11:19,879
I'm already on my way.

228
00:11:19,879 --> 00:11:20,800
Wait for me, Mingzhu.

229
00:11:38,260 --> 00:11:40,359
The gestational sac
is visible in the uterine cavity,

230
00:11:40,359 --> 00:11:42,200
and we can see the embryo.

231
00:11:42,200 --> 00:11:43,759
The heartbeat is visible as well.

232
00:11:43,759 --> 00:11:44,719
The baby looks healthy.

233
00:11:49,680 --> 00:11:50,839
Help, somebody help!

234
00:11:53,280 --> 00:11:54,440
Help!

235
00:11:55,400 --> 00:11:56,400
Help, please!

236
00:11:58,440 --> 00:11:59,599
Someone, please help!

237
00:11:59,800 --> 00:12:01,040
Hurry, help!

238
00:12:01,200 --> 00:12:01,999
Quick, help!

239
00:12:01,999 --> 00:12:03,160
Help!

240
00:12:06,320 --> 00:12:07,119
Hurry, save him.

241
00:12:07,359 --> 00:12:07,920
Save him.

242
00:12:09,359 --> 00:12:10,400
Help him, sir, hurry.

243
00:12:13,440 --> 00:12:14,400
Save him, please.

244
00:12:14,680 --> 00:12:15,960
Help him, quick.

245
00:12:19,040 --> 00:12:20,639
Don't give up, stay with us.

246
00:12:21,320 --> 00:12:21,960
Come on.

247
00:12:22,800 --> 00:12:24,400
Hold on, faster, keep going.

248
00:12:24,519 --> 00:12:25,759
Just a little longer.

249
00:12:28,680 --> 00:12:29,479
I'm sorry.

is currently unavailable.

Please…

252
00:12:43,359 --> 00:12:44,440
Hello, Yangyang?

253
00:12:45,080 --> 00:12:45,999
Can you check for me,

254
00:12:45,999 --> 00:12:47,359
is Jianqi still at the office?

255
00:12:48,999 --> 00:12:50,119
He took the afternoon off

256
00:12:50,119 --> 00:12:51,119
and left after lunch.

257
00:12:51,999 --> 00:12:52,759
Thanks.

258
00:12:57,960 --> 00:12:59,080
Make way, please.

259
00:13:00,639 --> 00:13:02,280
Move aside, everyone, move aside.

260
00:13:27,060 --> 00:13:28,860
(Nanzhou People's Hospital
Ultrasound Report)

261
00:13:45,800 --> 00:13:49,560
My son was not even 35 yet.

262
00:13:51,200 --> 00:13:51,920
Sister.

263
00:13:53,200 --> 00:13:55,080
Mingzhu is still pregnant.

264
00:13:56,239 --> 00:13:58,639
Jianqi was counting on you
to help with his child.

265
00:14:00,119 --> 00:14:01,879
The Feng family has an heir.

266
00:14:04,519 --> 00:14:05,800
Stay strong.

267
00:14:36,160 --> 00:14:36,759
Mingzhu.

268
00:14:37,160 --> 00:14:39,680
If you need to cry, just let it out.

269
00:14:53,280 --> 00:14:54,560
He was so young.

270
00:14:55,280 --> 00:14:57,560
It's a devastating blow
to his parents and family.

271
00:14:58,260 --> 00:14:59,999
The investigation
into his act of bravery

272
00:14:59,999 --> 00:15:02,150
and the official recognition process
has begun, right?

273
00:15:03,479 --> 00:15:06,119
We also need to expedite
the compensation for the family.

274
00:15:06,560 --> 00:15:08,479
We'll make sure
everything is handled with care.

275
00:15:16,800 --> 00:15:17,999
Jianqi!

276
00:15:21,080 --> 00:15:22,200
Meiqi.

277

Jianqi!

Meiqi.

279
00:15:30,440 --> 00:15:31,759
It's alright, Meiqi.

280
00:15:32,800 --> 00:15:34,719
Your brother was saving a child.

281
00:15:35,320 --> 00:15:36,080
He...

282
00:15:36,080 --> 00:15:37,440
Jianqi was a hero.

283

Jianqi.

284
00:15:39,599 --> 00:15:41,320
Jianqi was a hero.

285
00:15:41,960 --> 00:15:43,400
He earned great merit.

286
00:15:43,960 --> 00:15:47,560
Even in the next world,
he'll live a blessed life.

287
00:16:00,479 --> 00:16:01,160
Mingzhu.

288
00:16:02,800 --> 00:16:04,239
Get up and rest for a bit.

289
00:16:06,119 --> 00:16:08,200
You'll wear yourself out like this.

290
00:16:10,080 --> 00:16:12,400
Don't forget, you're carrying a baby.

291
00:16:16,960 --> 00:16:18,639
Mom, you should go home first.

292
00:16:22,479 --> 00:16:23,800
I want to stay with Jianqi.

293
00:16:25,839 --> 00:16:27,440
It's alright, I'll stay with you.

294
00:16:50,879 --> 00:16:51,639
Mingzhu.

295
00:16:51,920 --> 00:16:53,119
Have some noodles.

296
00:17:05,639 --> 00:17:07,999
I know losing my brother
hurts you deeply.

297
00:17:10,280 --> 00:17:12,359
But you have to eat,
or your body won't hold up.

298
00:17:13,560 --> 00:17:14,519
Just a little, please.

299
00:17:16,319 --> 00:17:17,960
Your brother hasn't eaten yet either.

300
00:17:20,999 --> 00:17:21,920
My brother is gone.

301
00:17:24,680 --> 00:17:26,279
You'll always be my sister-in-law.

302
00:17:29,920 --> 00:17:30,920
My sister is still young.

303
00:17:32,360 --> 00:17:33,440
Don't ruin her life.

304
00:17:38,840 --> 00:17:39,680
What did you say?

305
00:17:40,319 --> 00:17:41,039
I said,

306
00:17:42,200 --> 00:17:44,319
why should my sister
always be your sister-in-law?

307
00:17:44,759 --> 00:17:45,440
Enough.

308
00:17:45,999 --> 00:17:47,319
How dare you say that now?

309
00:18:00,999 --> 00:18:02,519
Because they loved each other.

(Tomb of Feng Jianqi)

311
00:18:52,920 --> 00:18:54,479
There's definitely nothing wrong.

312
00:18:57,239 --> 00:18:59,160
Jianqi was a swimming champion.

313
00:19:00,319 --> 00:19:01,999
Good genes run in our family.

Lihua.

316
00:19:11,120 --> 00:19:13,120
Jianqi was a swimming champion.

317
00:19:13,239 --> 00:19:15,920
How could he possibly have drowned?

318
00:19:19,200 --> 00:19:20,600
He was a champion swimmer.

319
00:19:20,600 --> 00:19:21,799
He was excellent at it.

320
00:19:23,920 --> 00:19:25,840
How could he have drowned?

321
00:19:26,719 --> 00:19:27,600
Why?

322
00:19:29,600 --> 00:19:32,239
Why did he have to die like that?

323
00:19:35,559 --> 00:19:38,319
Feng Jianqi,
why did you go to the river?

324
00:19:40,920 --> 00:19:42,600
Why did you have to drown?

325
00:19:43,759 --> 00:19:45,079
Our family has good genes.

326
00:19:45,079 --> 00:19:46,440
There won't be any problems.

327
00:19:48,079 --> 00:19:49,840
The baby will be perfectly fine.

328
00:20:04,200 --> 00:20:04,920
Mom.

329
00:20:07,160 --> 00:20:08,759
Even though Brother was a great swimmer,

330
00:20:10,519 --> 00:20:12,519
he wasn't a lifeguard.

331
00:20:12,519 --> 00:20:14,319
He never learned rescue techniques.

332
00:20:17,079 --> 00:20:20,400
Mingzhu will give birth to the baby.

333
00:20:22,759 --> 00:20:24,239
When that child comes,

334
00:20:25,440 --> 00:20:27,279
we'll make sure
he never goes near the river.

335
00:20:28,079 --> 00:20:29,279
I'll watch over him.

336
00:20:30,319 --> 00:20:32,160
I'll follow him every day.

337
00:20:32,319 --> 00:20:33,799
I'll keep an eye on him always.

338
00:20:40,239 --> 00:20:42,479
Mingzhu will have the baby, right?

339
00:20:45,680 --> 00:20:47,360
Mom, don't worry.

340
00:20:47,600 --> 00:20:50,319
She needs time to make her own decision.

341
00:20:50,740 --> 00:20:51,840
What's there to think about?

342
00:20:51,840 --> 00:20:52,810
There's no need to think.

343
00:20:52,820 --> 00:20:54,719
Our family has great genes.

00:20:55,160 --> 00:20:57,319
Jianqi was a swimming champion.

345
00:20:57,840 --> 00:20:58,719
He was outstanding.

346
00:20:58,719 --> 00:20:59,600
I'm telling you,

347
00:20:59,600 --> 00:21:02,079
Jianqi's son will be just like him.

348
00:21:02,799 --> 00:21:04,600
He'll be a swimming champion too.

349
00:21:04,600 --> 00:21:05,840
Our genes are good.

350
00:21:05,840 --> 00:21:07,279
There won't be any problems.

351
00:21:07,279 --> 00:21:08,559
The baby must be born.

352
00:21:08,559 --> 00:21:10,559
I'm telling you,
Jianqi was a swimming champion.

353
00:21:10,559 --> 00:21:12,759
His son will be a swimming champion too.

Our genes are good.

355
00:21:13,719 --> 00:21:14,680
There's no problem.

356
00:21:40,559 --> 00:21:43,519
There's no one left
to pick me up anymore.

357
00:21:46,200 --> 00:21:47,559
The baby is inside me.

358
00:21:48,559 --> 00:21:50,260
Whether to have it
or not is my decision.

359
00:21:56,840 --> 00:21:57,559
Alright.

360
00:21:59,600 --> 00:22:01,680
Before you make that decision,

361
00:22:03,079 --> 00:22:05,440
you should also
think about the rest of the family.

362
00:22:06,660 --> 00:22:08,079
Listen to all sides before judging.

363
00:22:09,719 --> 00:22:10,680
I know, Mom.

364
00:22:18,559 --> 00:22:19,759
Alright, I'll go now.

365
00:22:22,039 --> 00:22:22,920
Mom, take it slow.

366
00:22:23,759 --> 00:22:24,400
It's late.

367
00:22:24,400 --> 00:22:25,759
Why don't you take a cab home?

368
00:22:25,999 --> 00:22:26,479
Yes, Mom.

369
00:22:26,479 --> 00:22:27,160
Take a cab back.

370
00:22:27,160 --> 00:22:28,160
A cab?

371
00:22:28,840 --> 00:22:30,239
Your generation seems to have

372
00:22:30,239 --> 00:22:32,279
lost the virtue of thrift and frugality.

373
00:22:32,999 --> 00:22:34,680
No wonder you can't afford kids.

374
00:22:38,559 --> 00:22:39,279
Zhixia.

375
00:22:39,999 --> 00:22:41,479
No matter what you decide,

376
00:22:41,479 --> 00:22:42,120
remember this.

377
00:22:43,079 --> 00:22:44,160
Don't stay up too late.

378
00:22:44,279 --> 00:22:45,400
Try to get some rest early.

379
00:22:45,759 --> 00:22:46,400
Okay.

380
00:22:46,840 --> 00:22:47,440
Mom.

381
00:22:47,960 --> 00:22:49,519
I'll think about it carefully.

382
00:22:51,880 --> 00:22:52,640
Take care.

383
00:23:01,479 --> 00:23:04,160
We should listen to what people think.

384
00:23:04,360 --> 00:23:06,160
Everyone seems to agree.

385
00:23:06,960 --> 00:23:08,279
Really, have the baby.

386
00:23:08,880 --> 00:23:10,519
Think about it, the baby chose us

387
00:23:10,519 --> 00:23:11,640
to be its parents.

388
00:23:11,640 --> 00:23:12,999
Can you really turn it away?

389
00:23:13,640 --> 00:23:15,319
You think I don't want to keep it?

390
00:23:16,319 --> 00:23:18,079
But how would I raise it?

391
00:23:18,079 --> 00:23:19,920
I'll raise it, I'll take care of it.

392
00:23:19,920 --> 00:23:22,020
Didn't I do a good job raising Jiao?

393
00:23:22,020 --> 00:23:23,950
You can have as many
as you want, I'll handle it.

394
00:23:26,319 --> 00:23:26,960
If I do,

395
00:23:27,920 --> 00:23:30,039
this apartment
won't be big enough anymore.

396
00:23:30,360 --> 00:23:31,160
How about this,

397
00:23:31,799 --> 00:23:32,999
get me a three-bedroom place,

398
00:23:32,999 --> 00:23:34,340
and I'll have the baby right away.

399
00:23:35,479 --> 00:23:37,519
I don't think this is about the house.

400
00:23:38,279 --> 00:23:39,600
We can just buy a bunk bed.

401
00:23:40,110 --> 00:23:41,400
Let Jiao share it with the baby.

402
00:23:41,400 --> 00:23:42,039
Exactly.

403
00:23:42,319 --> 00:23:43,750
Or get a little carrier.

404
00:23:43,760 --> 00:23:45,079
Jiao can carry the baby to school.

405
00:23:45,079 --> 00:23:46,279
Then we won't have to worry.

406
00:23:46,279 --> 00:23:47,540
That means I've made it in life.

407
00:23:49,360 --> 00:23:50,079
Mom.

408
00:23:50,079 --> 00:23:51,719
Come sleep with me.

409
00:23:52,559 --> 00:23:54,160
Hear that, "successful man"?

410
00:23:54,360 --> 00:23:58,039
Ms. Xia, President Xu, boss.

411
00:23:58,519 --> 00:23:59,400
Mommy.

412
00:23:59,400 --> 00:24:00,559
Come sleep with me.

413
00:24:00,559 --> 00:24:01,279
Coming.

414
00:24:04,920 --> 00:24:06,039
Coming.

415
00:24:07,079 --> 00:24:09,160
My little troublemaker.

416
00:24:13,400 --> 00:24:14,160
Come here.

417
00:24:14,999 --> 00:24:16,920
Let me hold you while you sleep.

418
00:24:21,319 --> 00:24:22,039
Mom.

419
00:24:22,799 --> 00:24:24,160
If you have a new baby,

420
00:24:24,479 --> 00:24:25,880
does that mean you won't

421
00:24:25,880 --> 00:24:27,440
sleep cuddling me anymore?

422
00:24:27,440 --> 00:24:28,559
Who said that?

423
00:24:29,360 --> 00:24:30,960
I can hold one with my left arm

424
00:24:30,960 --> 00:24:32,279
and one with my right.

425
00:24:32,279 --> 00:24:33,039
Right?

426
00:24:34,200 --> 00:24:34,799
Then

427
00:24:35,799 --> 00:24:36,640
what about me?

428
00:24:38,880 --> 00:24:39,920
One on my left leg,

429
00:24:40,200 --> 00:24:41,279
one on my right.

430
00:24:41,279 --> 00:24:41,960
How's that?

431
00:24:42,200 --> 00:24:43,200
One is enough.

432
00:24:43,680 --> 00:24:44,400
Not enough.

433
00:24:44,400 --> 00:24:45,200
Enough, one's enough.

434
00:24:45,200 --> 00:24:47,719
Not enough, the more the better.

435
00:24:50,759 --> 00:24:52,120
You two, stop arguing.

436
00:24:52,400 --> 00:24:54,519
The kid needs to sleep.

437
00:24:54,680 --> 00:24:56,440
Yeah, the kid needs to sleep.

438
00:24:56,440 --> 00:24:57,319
Daddy, out.

439
00:24:57,759 --> 00:24:58,440
Alright.

440
00:24:58,880 --> 00:24:59,880
I'm leaving, goodnight.

441
00:25:06,999 --> 00:25:08,680
Goodnight, Makka Pakka.

442
00:25:08,880 --> 00:25:09,880
Go on, out.

443
00:25:12,680 --> 00:25:13,360
Mom.

444
00:25:14,160 --> 00:25:16,039
I agree you can have a baby.

445
00:25:16,920 --> 00:25:18,440
But I don't agree to getting a dog.

446
00:25:18,880 --> 00:25:19,999
Then let's just

447
00:25:20,400 --> 00:25:21,519
have a baby instead.

448
00:25:25,120 --> 00:25:27,719
Raising a dog
isn't the same as raising a baby.

449
00:25:28,400 --> 00:25:29,160
It's the same.

450
00:25:29,600 --> 00:25:30,600
We love them,

451
00:25:30,960 --> 00:25:32,319
and they'll love us back.

452
00:25:38,640 --> 00:25:39,559
Sweetheart,

453
00:25:40,319 --> 00:25:41,200
go to sleep.

454
00:25:45,440 --> 00:25:46,559
Turn off the light.

455
00:25:50,440 --> 00:25:51,360
Goodnight, Mom.

456
00:25:52,319 --> 00:25:53,640
Goodnight, my love.

457
00:25:53,999 --> 00:25:54,920
I love you.

458
00:25:55,759 --> 00:25:57,039
Mommy loves you too.

459
00:25:59,920 --> 00:26:01,799
Don't listen to your father.

460
00:26:02,039 --> 00:26:03,759
Really, what do men know

461
00:26:03,759 --> 00:26:05,160
about the pain of childbirth?

462
00:26:05,360 --> 00:26:06,600
The baby's already here,

463
00:26:06,600 --> 00:26:08,039
how could we not want it?

464
00:26:08,660 --> 00:26:10,600
Worry about giving birth,
not raising the child.

465
00:26:10,759 --> 00:26:13,079
That would be the same in any era.

466
00:26:13,880 --> 00:26:15,559
Think about it, the baby chose us

467
00:26:15,559 --> 00:26:16,719
to be its parents.

468
00:26:16,719 --> 00:26:17,999
Can you really turn it away?

469
00:26:32,279 --> 00:26:32,960
Today,

470
00:26:34,519 --> 00:26:35,640
we invited our in-laws over

471
00:26:36,079 --> 00:26:38,400
to discuss a few important matters.

472
00:26:41,079 --> 00:26:43,460
We'd like to set up a memorial
for Jianqi, in Mingzhu's name.

473
00:26:44,079 --> 00:26:46,400
This is something
his mother and I both wish for.

474
00:26:46,960 --> 00:26:47,680
In-laws,

475
00:26:49,880 --> 00:26:51,200
if you had such plans of your own,

476
00:26:53,079 --> 00:26:54,640
why didn't you discuss them with us?

477
00:26:54,999 --> 00:26:58,160
She's still alive, and you're already
putting up a tombstone?

478
00:27:00,460 --> 00:27:02,610
After all, they've already
registered their marriage,

479
00:27:03,300 --> 00:27:04,719
so they're legally husband and wife.

480
00:27:06,160 --> 00:27:07,319
We just

481
00:27:08,400 --> 00:27:10,319
don't want Mingzhu to forget Jianqi.

482
00:27:10,319 --> 00:27:11,440
That's not the point.

483
00:27:11,440 --> 00:27:13,759
You... Sure, they got
the marriage certificate,

484
00:27:13,759 --> 00:27:15,479
but they never held a wedding, right?

485
00:27:15,600 --> 00:27:17,460
Even the password to their home,

486
00:27:17,470 --> 00:27:18,560
my daughter doesn't know it.

487
00:27:18,570 --> 00:27:20,120
And now you want her name
carved on the tombstone?

488
00:27:20,120 --> 00:27:21,279
That doesn't seem right.

489
00:27:21,640 --> 00:27:22,640
Enough, stop arguing.

490
00:27:23,920 --> 00:27:24,999
Let the in-laws speak.

491
00:27:25,680 --> 00:27:28,400
Let's hear what else you've got in mind.

492
00:27:33,880 --> 00:27:37,319
We plan to transfer
the house to Mingzhu.

493
00:27:42,479 --> 00:27:43,120
Mingzhu.

494
00:27:44,039 --> 00:27:47,400
I know I was wrong
about many things before.

495
00:27:48,200 --> 00:27:50,479
I'm sorry. I owe you an apology.

496
00:27:52,680 --> 00:27:53,880
From now on,

497
00:27:55,079 --> 00:27:56,400
please call me Mom.

498
00:28:06,759 --> 00:28:07,479
Mrs. Feng,

499
00:28:08,600 --> 00:28:09,680
I never blamed you.

500
00:28:14,759 --> 00:28:15,519
I know

501
00:28:16,880 --> 00:28:17,920
you're upset with me.

502
00:28:19,279 --> 00:28:22,079
I was the one who refused
to let you call me Mom before.

503
00:28:22,759 --> 00:28:23,960
That must've hurt you.

504
00:28:26,799 --> 00:28:27,799
I'm sorry.

505
00:28:30,960 --> 00:28:32,160
For Jianqi's sake,

506
00:28:33,200 --> 00:28:34,759
please keep the baby.

507
00:28:36,120 --> 00:28:38,319
If you have any conditions,
just tell us.

508
00:28:41,799 --> 00:28:42,999
I don't have any.

509
00:28:45,479 --> 00:28:46,239
Mingzhu.

510
00:28:46,880 --> 00:28:49,440
The way Jianqi's mom
might've treated you before…

511
00:28:52,160 --> 00:28:54,319
I hope you can understand her, alright?

512
00:28:54,799 --> 00:28:56,600
Yes, it was all my fault.

513
00:29:00,640 --> 00:29:01,999
I think about this matter...

514
00:29:02,799 --> 00:29:03,680
The baby's matter...

515
00:29:05,680 --> 00:29:06,759
We should go back

516
00:29:08,120 --> 00:29:09,200
and talk it over again.

517
00:29:11,479 --> 00:29:12,239
Alright, fine.

518
00:29:12,719 --> 00:29:14,319
Then let's talk about the house.

519
00:29:14,559 --> 00:29:16,279
I know you have concerns,

520
00:29:16,640 --> 00:29:17,880
and we understand that.

521
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:22,519
About the house, I've already discussed it
with Jianqi's mother.

522
00:29:25,200 --> 00:29:26,519
As long as Mingzhu agrees,

523
00:29:27,799 --> 00:29:29,440
we'll transfer Jianqi's apartment

524
00:29:29,999 --> 00:29:32,479
to her name.

525
00:29:33,319 --> 00:29:36,279
That home will belong to
Mingzhu and the child.

526
00:29:36,999 --> 00:29:38,479
We'll live right across the street,

527
00:29:38,999 --> 00:29:40,330
so we can help take care of them.

528
00:29:41,039 --> 00:29:43,319
We'll cover all of Mingzhu
and the child's expenses

529
00:29:43,999 --> 00:29:45,440
in the future.

530
00:29:47,400 --> 00:29:48,600
When the child is born,

531
00:29:49,039 --> 00:29:52,680
we'll take care of school,
study abroad, even the wedding.

532
00:29:53,519 --> 00:29:56,479
All of it will be our responsibility.

533
00:30:02,759 --> 00:30:05,160
If you still have any concerns,

534
00:30:05,239 --> 00:30:06,479
we can draw up an agreement.

535
00:30:06,799 --> 00:30:08,640
Jianqi's uncle is a lawyer.

536
00:30:10,120 --> 00:30:12,160
Yes, I'm a professional.

537
00:30:14,200 --> 00:30:17,319
So in the end, you just want my sister
to have the baby.

538
00:30:18,719 --> 00:30:19,559
What about my sister?

539
00:30:20,200 --> 00:30:21,330
Have you thought about her?

540
00:30:22,160 --> 00:30:23,400
She's still so young.

541
00:30:23,410 --> 00:30:25,460
If she raises a child alone,
how will she remarry?

542
00:30:26,519 --> 00:30:28,319
That's not the point right now.

543
00:30:28,319 --> 00:30:29,279
Jianqi just passed away,

544
00:30:29,279 --> 00:30:31,400
and you're already
talking about remarriage?

545
00:30:31,400 --> 00:30:32,519
You invited us

546
00:30:32,960 --> 00:30:34,239
here to talk

547
00:30:34,239 --> 00:30:37,039
about the child's future.

548
00:30:37,719 --> 00:30:38,360
And we...

549
00:30:38,970 --> 00:30:41,039
We're just supposed
to sit here and listen to you?

550
00:30:41,039 --> 00:30:42,360
Only you get to decide?

551
00:30:44,799 --> 00:30:46,840
I will never remarry.

552
00:30:48,640 --> 00:30:51,239
Mingzhu, don't say things like that.

553
00:30:52,200 --> 00:30:52,960
You...

554
00:30:53,279 --> 00:30:54,600
You're still young.

555
00:30:54,600 --> 00:30:56,079
Who knows what will happen later?

556
00:30:56,079 --> 00:30:57,360
Let's not talk so far ahead.

557
00:30:57,360 --> 00:30:58,519
She already said it clearly.

558
00:30:58,519 --> 00:30:59,840
Mingzhu won't remarry.

559
00:30:59,840 --> 00:31:02,160
Why do you keep insisting otherwise?

560
00:31:02,799 --> 00:31:04,960
Mingzhu and Jianqi
truly loved each other.

561
00:31:05,160 --> 00:31:07,319
This child is the fruit of their love.

562
00:31:07,559 --> 00:31:09,999
And now that there's a "fruit of love,"

563
00:31:09,999 --> 00:31:11,039
who was it before who said

564
00:31:11,600 --> 00:31:12,799
to divorce and abort the baby?

565
00:31:12,799 --> 00:31:15,850
What's that supposed to mean?

566
00:31:15,860 --> 00:31:17,799
You can push us around
just because my son's gone?

567
00:31:17,799 --> 00:31:18,920
Enough, no one's bullying anyone.

568
00:31:18,920 --> 00:31:19,519
No one's being bullied.

569
00:31:19,519 --> 00:31:20,250
Alright, everyone.

570
00:31:20,400 --> 00:31:21,840
We came to discuss things peacefully.

571
00:31:22,479 --> 00:31:24,279
Let's not get too worked up.

572
00:31:24,600 --> 00:31:26,680
Because of Jianqi,

573
00:31:27,840 --> 00:31:28,999
and now because of his child,

574
00:31:28,999 --> 00:31:31,759
we have already become one family.

575
00:31:32,519 --> 00:31:33,960
Mr. Shen, you know this well.

576
00:31:37,759 --> 00:31:38,759
In our Feng family,

577
00:31:38,759 --> 00:31:40,440
we only had one son.

578
00:31:41,479 --> 00:31:43,559
This child is the only heir

579
00:31:43,680 --> 00:31:45,400
that Jianqi has left us.

580
00:31:46,279 --> 00:31:47,719
I hope you can understand.

581
00:31:48,799 --> 00:31:49,759
I truly wish

582
00:31:51,680 --> 00:31:53,479
that Mingzhu can keep the baby.

583
00:31:54,160 --> 00:31:55,200
But please rest assured,

584
00:31:55,519 --> 00:31:57,600
we will never interfere in her future.

585
00:31:58,840 --> 00:32:00,079
And we will never

586
00:32:00,600 --> 00:32:02,319
use the child to hold her back.

587
00:32:03,960 --> 00:32:05,880
If one day in the future,

588
00:32:06,479 --> 00:32:08,559
Mingzhu decides to remarry,

589
00:32:10,479 --> 00:32:11,519
I will understand

590
00:32:12,279 --> 00:32:12,960
and support her.

591
00:32:14,079 --> 00:32:16,160
We will not interfere in any way.

592
00:32:22,079 --> 00:32:22,759
Mingzhu,

593
00:32:24,279 --> 00:32:25,440
now that Jianqi is gone,

594
00:32:26,640 --> 00:32:27,719
from this day on,

595
00:32:29,200 --> 00:32:30,840
you are our daughter.

596
00:32:32,559 --> 00:32:34,319
We will treat you with care and respect.

597
00:32:35,680 --> 00:32:39,279
If one day you meet someone suitable,

598
00:32:40,840 --> 00:32:42,600
we will proudly send you off

599
00:32:42,600 --> 00:32:45,079
just like our own daughter.

600
00:32:46,120 --> 00:32:47,680
Please have the baby.

601
00:32:48,960 --> 00:32:49,880
I will help raise it.

602
00:32:50,960 --> 00:32:52,590
If you cannot
bear to part with the child,

603
00:32:52,600 --> 00:32:53,960
you may take the baby with you.

604
00:32:54,039 --> 00:32:56,640
You can raise the child yourself.

605
00:32:57,440 --> 00:32:59,440
We only ask

606
00:32:59,440 --> 00:33:00,840
that you let us see the child

607
00:33:01,079 --> 00:33:03,600
from time to time.

608
00:33:04,600 --> 00:33:06,880
Mingzhu, please, I'm begging you.

609
00:33:06,880 --> 00:33:08,039
For Jianqi's sake,

610
00:33:09,360 --> 00:33:11,880
let us have something
to remember him by.

611
00:33:12,440 --> 00:33:13,200
Will you?

612
00:33:15,440 --> 00:33:16,880
Have the baby.

613
00:33:18,360 --> 00:33:19,799
Everything else can be discussed.

614
00:33:20,120 --> 00:33:22,719
Whatever you ask for,
we will agree to it.

615
00:33:22,719 --> 00:33:23,759
I promise.

616
00:33:24,319 --> 00:33:25,160
Please have the baby.

617
00:33:25,560 --> 00:33:26,680
Everything can be worked out.

618
00:33:26,880 --> 00:33:29,039
We can talk about anything, alright?

619
00:33:32,799 --> 00:33:33,759
Mingzhu,

620
00:33:35,880 --> 00:33:37,799
the child belongs to Jianqi,

621
00:33:38,360 --> 00:33:41,319
but it's also your own flesh and blood.

622
00:33:41,840 --> 00:33:43,200
That's right, Mingzhu.

623
00:33:44,680 --> 00:33:46,559
It's a life too, isn't it?

624
00:33:47,880 --> 00:33:48,960
Enough, all of you.

625
00:33:51,500 --> 00:33:52,719
Whether the baby is born or not

626
00:33:54,200 --> 00:33:55,319
is my decision.

627
00:34:05,120 --> 00:34:05,920
Come eat.

628
00:34:07,239 --> 00:34:07,880
Zhang,

629
00:34:08,600 --> 00:34:09,840
this egg is too greasy.

630
00:34:11,240 --> 00:34:13,120
But that's your favorite,
the double-sided egg.

631
00:34:14,239 --> 00:34:16,160
From now on,
I'll only eat single-sided ones.

632
00:34:19,210 --> 00:34:20,840
Then I'll make
single-sided ones for you.

633
00:34:20,960 --> 00:34:21,679
From now on.

634
00:34:29,800 --> 00:34:30,479
Little Zhang,

635
00:34:31,240 --> 00:34:32,479
this milk is too cold.

636
00:34:32,999 --> 00:34:34,039
Warm it up for me.

637
00:34:34,720 --> 00:34:35,400
Dad,

638
00:34:35,960 --> 00:34:37,400
warm the milk for Mom.

639
00:34:37,960 --> 00:34:39,039
I want you to do it.

640
00:34:40,039 --> 00:34:43,400
From this moment on, you need to learn
to take care of others.

641
00:34:44,720 --> 00:34:45,599
Why?

642
00:34:47,039 --> 00:34:48,880
Because you're about
to become a big sister.

643
00:34:50,990 --> 00:34:52,199
So you've decided to have it?

644
00:34:53,519 --> 00:34:54,519
Agree?

645
00:34:54,519 --> 00:34:57,199
Jiao, you're going to be a big sister.

646
00:34:58,559 --> 00:34:59,440
From this moment on,

647
00:34:59,440 --> 00:35:01,440
we'll take even better care
of Mom together.

648
00:35:01,660 --> 00:35:02,880
Zhang Service, at your service.

649
00:35:02,880 --> 00:35:04,520
Little Zhang Service,
reporting for duty.

650
00:35:08,079 --> 00:35:08,720
Mom,

651
00:35:08,800 --> 00:35:10,400
from now on I'll sleep with the baby.

652
00:35:12,079 --> 00:35:14,039
So, Madam, how's the massage pressure?

653
00:35:15,199 --> 00:35:17,880
Shall we begin breakfast now?

654
00:35:17,999 --> 00:35:18,720
Excellent.

655
00:35:18,999 --> 00:35:20,639
Fried egg.

656
00:35:21,199 --> 00:35:21,720
Milk.

657
00:35:21,880 --> 00:35:22,440
Uh...

658
00:35:22,440 --> 00:35:24,390
- Where do we warm the milk?
- And where do we fry the eggs?

659
00:35:24,400 --> 00:35:25,430
Where do we warm the milk?

660
00:35:25,440 --> 00:35:26,400
Over there.

661
00:35:26,400 --> 00:35:27,720
Here, give it to me, I'll take it.

662
00:35:28,240 --> 00:35:29,479
Yes, grab a napkin.

663
00:35:30,410 --> 00:35:31,199
Where's the napkin?

664
00:35:31,810 --> 00:35:32,479
The napkin is...

665
00:35:32,479 --> 00:35:33,639
Here, right here.

666
00:35:34,400 --> 00:35:34,999
Here.

667
00:35:35,199 --> 00:35:35,760
Got it.

668
00:35:43,039 --> 00:35:44,810
I need to feed you well
and keep you healthy,

669
00:35:44,999 --> 00:35:46,320
so when the baby is born,

670
00:35:46,420 --> 00:35:47,559
the baby will be healthy too.

671
00:35:49,639 --> 00:35:50,479
The doctor said

672
00:35:51,559 --> 00:35:53,079
our baby is developing well.

673
00:35:53,080 --> 00:35:54,550
They already saw the gestational sac.

674
00:35:54,960 --> 00:35:55,559
Touch here.

675
00:35:56,920 --> 00:35:59,240
How could you bear to
leave me and the baby behind?

676
00:36:01,920 --> 00:36:02,679
Jianqi.

681
00:36:43,999 --> 00:36:46,880
I don't think
she slept at all last night.

682
00:36:47,800 --> 00:36:49,360
I stood by her door a few times.

683
00:36:49,360 --> 00:36:51,159
She kept tossing and turning.

684
00:36:54,199 --> 00:36:55,599
She has too much on her mind.

685
00:36:56,599 --> 00:36:57,639
Who could sleep like that?

686
00:37:05,159 --> 00:37:06,119
Dad, Mom.

687
00:37:09,800 --> 00:37:10,599
Is she up?

688
00:37:10,880 --> 00:37:11,559
Not yet.

689
00:37:12,660 --> 00:37:13,599
I'm heading to school.

690
00:37:13,599 --> 00:37:14,400
Eat something first.

691
00:37:15,079 --> 00:37:16,639
No, I'm going now.

692
00:37:17,159 --> 00:37:17,760
Wait.

693
00:37:18,639 --> 00:37:19,360
What is it?

694
00:37:20,639 --> 00:37:22,559
Be careful on the way.

695
00:37:23,440 --> 00:37:24,800
Don't worry, Mom.

696
00:37:26,270 --> 00:37:27,850
- Take this to eat on the way.
- Thanks, Dad.

697
00:37:28,479 --> 00:37:29,039
I'm off.

698
00:37:29,720 --> 00:37:31,039
Don't worry too much, both of you.

699
00:37:31,599 --> 00:37:33,519
Keep your eyes on the road
when you're riding.

700
00:37:39,519 --> 00:37:41,400
A child is always a mother's heart.

701
00:37:46,320 --> 00:37:47,400
You know, Jianqi and

702
00:37:48,840 --> 00:37:50,639
our daughter really loved each other.

703
00:37:52,280 --> 00:37:53,159
I think

704
00:37:57,079 --> 00:37:59,519
she won't be able to give up this baby.

705
00:38:01,660 --> 00:38:03,440
Sounds like you're the one
who can't let go.

706
00:38:03,999 --> 00:38:06,320
But didn't they say already

707
00:38:06,639 --> 00:38:08,519
they'd support her
if she wanted to remarry?

708
00:38:09,079 --> 00:38:09,880
Besides,

709
00:38:10,039 --> 00:38:11,440
as her mother,

710
00:38:11,760 --> 00:38:12,479
you see,

711
00:38:13,119 --> 00:38:14,800
Jianqi's mother lost her son.

712
00:38:15,960 --> 00:38:17,210
If she loses her grandson too...

713
00:38:18,050 --> 00:38:19,639
She just wants something to hold on to.

714
00:38:19,639 --> 00:38:21,360
Otherwise, she'd lose her mind,
you know?

715
00:38:21,360 --> 00:38:23,159
I don't care
who loses their mind right now.

716
00:38:24,800 --> 00:38:27,999
What matters is how our daughter
is going to live her life.

717
00:38:32,159 --> 00:38:33,159
You're awake, Mingzhu?

718
00:38:34,350 --> 00:38:35,400
Didn't sleep a bit longer?

719
00:38:35,639 --> 00:38:36,840
Did we wake you up?

720
00:38:37,159 --> 00:38:37,840
No.

721
00:38:38,960 --> 00:38:39,999
I'm going to the hospital.

722
00:38:40,599 --> 00:38:43,320
I didn't have time to show the doctor
the last ultrasound report.

723
00:38:44,400 --> 00:38:45,440
I'll go with you.

724
00:38:45,440 --> 00:38:46,159
No need, Mom.

725
00:38:46,999 --> 00:38:48,440
You have the shop to open soon.

726
00:38:49,039 --> 00:38:50,079
I can go by myself.

727
00:38:50,320 --> 00:38:51,920
Let your mom go with you.

728
00:38:51,920 --> 00:38:52,559
Yes.

729
00:38:52,760 --> 00:38:53,360
Dad.

730
00:38:54,159 --> 00:38:57,400
There are some roads
I have to learn to walk alone.

731
00:39:18,079 --> 00:39:18,960
Hello, Ni.

732
00:39:19,760 --> 00:39:20,599
What are you doing?

733
00:39:21,039 --> 00:39:23,079
I'm heading to the hospital
for a prenatal checkup.

734
00:39:23,559 --> 00:39:24,639
Which hospital?

735
00:39:24,920 --> 00:39:25,880
I'll come with you.

736
00:39:26,119 --> 00:39:26,760
No need.

737
00:39:27,639 --> 00:39:29,400
I didn't even let my mom come with me.

738
00:39:30,159 --> 00:39:31,440
I just want to see

739
00:39:32,320 --> 00:39:33,880
if I can really do this on my own.

740
00:39:35,320 --> 00:39:35,840
Alright.

741
00:39:35,840 --> 00:39:37,639
If anything happens, call me anytime.

742
00:39:38,400 --> 00:39:38,920
Got it.

743
00:39:39,159 --> 00:39:39,840
Don't worry.

744
00:39:40,520 --> 00:39:42,400
Wasn't there a hero
who saved a drowning child?

745
00:39:42,599 --> 00:39:43,479
Did he live here?

746
00:39:44,400 --> 00:39:45,639
That young woman just now

747
00:39:45,639 --> 00:39:46,679
is the hero's wife.

748
00:39:48,079 --> 00:39:48,999
She was abandoned

749
00:39:49,240 --> 00:39:50,639
by her parents when she was little.

750
00:39:50,840 --> 00:39:52,840
When she grew up, she married

751
00:39:52,840 --> 00:39:54,320
a good man, a real catch.

752
00:39:54,679 --> 00:39:56,079
But right after they got married,

753
00:39:56,199 --> 00:39:58,639
he drowned while saving that child.

754
00:39:58,679 --> 00:39:59,800
Such a good man.

755
00:40:00,960 --> 00:40:02,639
Doctor, please save him.

756
00:40:03,320 --> 00:40:04,280
He's a fine young man.

757
00:40:04,720 --> 00:40:06,199
Do everything you can.

758
00:40:06,479 --> 00:40:08,079
She's carrying his child.

759
00:40:08,760 --> 00:40:09,800
At least the baby

760
00:40:10,159 --> 00:40:11,320
will carry on his name.

761
00:40:11,639 --> 00:40:12,840
But she's still so young.

762
00:40:12,840 --> 00:40:13,800
Once the baby's born,

763
00:40:13,999 --> 00:40:15,800
how will she live from then on?

764
00:40:22,639 --> 00:40:23,800
Excuse us, please.

765
00:40:26,240 --> 00:40:27,079
Make some room.

766
00:41:09,079 --> 00:41:09,800
Jianqi.

767
00:41:11,400 --> 00:41:12,960
I wish you were here with me.

768
00:41:14,999 --> 00:41:18,039
Do you think I can make it on my own?

769
00:41:19,240 --> 00:41:21,479
You always said I was strong.

770
00:41:22,199 --> 00:41:22,920
Was I?

771
00:41:42,800 --> 00:41:44,159
