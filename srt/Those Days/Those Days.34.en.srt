00:01:12,431 --> 00:01:14,800
(Adapted from iceread.com novel
"You Xi" by Qingyang Wanxi)

00:01:14,980 --> 00:01:17,980
=Episode 34=

4
00:01:18,399 --> 00:01:19,360
- Slowly.
- Slowly.

5
00:01:19,760 --> 00:01:20,650
It's fine. We are here.

6
00:01:22,640 --> 00:01:23,240
Walk slowly.

7
00:01:23,240 --> 00:01:24,399
- Grab hold of that.
- Sure.

8
00:01:24,400 --> 00:01:25,150
That's good enough.

9
00:01:25,399 --> 00:01:25,960
Here you go.

10
00:01:27,559 --> 00:01:28,240
Well,

11
00:01:28,960 --> 00:01:30,870
Minghui's room isn't that great.

12
00:01:31,279 --> 00:01:32,960
Just make do with it.

13
00:01:33,600 --> 00:01:34,440
Is that fine?

14
00:01:35,279 --> 00:01:35,880
Mrs. Xu,

15
00:01:36,919 --> 00:01:37,720
thank you.

16
00:01:40,520 --> 00:01:41,600
You only know

17
00:01:41,800 --> 00:01:44,279
who's the closest to you
when you're in trouble.

18
00:01:46,199 --> 00:01:48,199
Don't say that. We're a family.

19
00:01:49,319 --> 00:01:51,119
Family members don't thank each other.

20
00:01:51,119 --> 00:01:52,119
Come and sit.

21
00:01:55,520 --> 00:01:56,319
Don't act like this.

22
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:57,839
Sorry.

23
00:01:59,080 --> 00:02:01,199
I didn't protect Mingzhu's house.

24
00:02:04,520 --> 00:02:06,279
It's all right.

25
00:02:07,160 --> 00:02:09,439
Mingzhu told me

26
00:02:10,439 --> 00:02:12,240
you started from scratch.

27
00:02:12,920 --> 00:02:14,960
Perhaps Mingzhu can do the same, right?

28
00:02:15,270 --> 00:02:17,350
It's fine for young people
to go through some obstacles.

29
00:02:17,399 --> 00:02:18,599
Don't overthink.

30
00:02:18,599 --> 00:02:19,200
All right.

31
00:02:19,640 --> 00:02:20,640
Sorry for troubling you.

32
00:02:20,760 --> 00:02:21,839
Not at all.

33
00:02:21,999 --> 00:02:23,119
We are home.

34
00:02:23,320 --> 00:02:25,399
Both of you can stay in this room.

35
00:02:25,399 --> 00:02:26,480
Make do with it.

36
00:02:26,640 --> 00:02:27,839
I heard Mingzhu say

37
00:02:28,040 --> 00:02:29,719
you built this bed yourself.

38
00:02:30,440 --> 00:02:31,719
Don't worry about the materials.

39
00:02:31,719 --> 00:02:32,810
It's free from formaldehyde.

40
00:02:33,040 --> 00:02:33,559
Yes.

41
00:02:33,559 --> 00:02:34,879
Here. This is your room.

42
00:02:39,620 --> 00:02:40,879
Aren't you going to get a bowl?

43
00:02:40,879 --> 00:02:41,760
I've eaten, Dad.

44
00:02:42,119 --> 00:02:43,800
Quick. Try it. I made it myself.

45
00:02:43,920 --> 00:02:44,640
Let me try it.

46
00:02:45,520 --> 00:02:47,320
The noodle looks delicious.

47
00:02:48,879 --> 00:02:49,800
It smells really nice.

48
00:02:49,800 --> 00:02:50,620
Isn't it delicious?

49
00:02:52,570 --> 00:02:53,850
What do you think of the noodles?

50
00:02:55,719 --> 00:02:56,920
It's too salty.

51
00:02:57,719 --> 00:02:58,360
Mrs. Feng,

52
00:02:58,640 --> 00:03:00,839
life is too bland for me.

53
00:03:00,839 --> 00:03:02,320
My life is meaningless

54
00:03:02,320 --> 00:03:03,520
if my noodles aren't salty.

55
00:03:03,520 --> 00:03:04,279
Brat,

56
00:03:04,520 --> 00:03:05,760
you don't study well

57
00:03:06,040 --> 00:03:07,279
yet you have a sharp tongue.

58
00:03:07,279 --> 00:03:07,920
It's salty?

59
00:03:07,920 --> 00:03:09,040
I don't think it's too salty.

60
00:03:09,839 --> 00:03:10,439
No.

61
00:03:10,920 --> 00:03:12,760
I'm used to eating light food.

62
00:03:12,760 --> 00:03:14,920
Go and get Mrs. Feng a bowl of soup.

63
00:03:15,080 --> 00:03:16,040
It's fine.

64
00:03:16,240 --> 00:03:17,320
- Minghui.
- Add some soup.

65
00:03:18,240 --> 00:03:19,960
I took your room.

66
00:03:20,399 --> 00:03:21,920
I'm really sorry.

67
00:03:21,920 --> 00:03:24,320
- It's fine, Mrs. Feng.
- Where will you sleep now?

68
00:03:24,320 --> 00:03:25,920
I am now

69
00:03:25,920 --> 00:03:27,159
a minor influencer.

70
00:03:27,159 --> 00:03:29,080
I can just arrange

71
00:03:29,080 --> 00:03:30,879
a suite in a luxury hotel.

72
00:03:30,879 --> 00:03:31,559
Is that true?

73
00:03:31,559 --> 00:03:33,800
Don't listen to his nonsense. Hotel?

74
00:03:33,920 --> 00:03:35,159
He's a young man.

75
00:03:35,159 --> 00:03:36,920
His bed has been arranged.

76
00:03:36,920 --> 00:03:38,920
Young people can sleep anywhere.

77
00:03:38,999 --> 00:03:40,380
I'm telling you. When he's sleeping,

78
00:03:40,380 --> 00:03:42,790
you can put him at the village entrance
and he can still sleep.

79
00:03:42,800 --> 00:03:43,240
Mom.

80
00:03:43,240 --> 00:03:45,640
Are you fine with sleeping there?

81
00:03:45,640 --> 00:03:46,240
Of course.

82
00:03:46,240 --> 00:03:48,240
If it doesn't work, we'll change it
for him. This is a big house.

83
00:03:48,240 --> 00:03:49,320
He will surely have a place to sleep.

84
00:03:49,320 --> 00:03:50,159
Don't worry.

85
00:03:51,040 --> 00:03:52,439
Don't worry. It's fine.

86
00:03:52,960 --> 00:03:53,879
Thank you.

87
00:03:53,999 --> 00:03:55,719
- It's all right, Mrs. Feng.
- Thank you.

88
00:03:55,719 --> 00:03:57,719
Don't need to thank us.

89
00:03:58,050 --> 00:03:58,559
Here you go.

90
00:04:01,040 --> 00:04:02,040
Is this mine?

91
00:04:03,520 --> 00:04:04,360
I'm impressed.

92
00:04:05,080 --> 00:04:05,679
Mingzhu.

93
00:04:08,040 --> 00:04:08,640
Ms. Shen.

94
00:04:09,879 --> 00:04:12,360
Please take good care of me, Ms. Shen.

95
00:04:13,080 --> 00:04:14,999
I plan to leave this restaurant

96
00:04:14,999 --> 00:04:16,120
to my sister-in-law,

97
00:04:16,399 --> 00:04:17,960
Ms. Feng, to manage it.

98
00:04:19,080 --> 00:04:19,919
Why?

99
00:04:21,039 --> 00:04:23,200
Pregnancy doesn't affect your job
as the boss.

100
00:04:23,799 --> 00:04:27,080
Who was it who said no department wanted
to hire a pregnant lady?

101
00:04:27,880 --> 00:04:30,039
I was wrong.

102
00:04:31,919 --> 00:04:34,680
You are the one hiring now.

103
00:04:35,239 --> 00:04:37,719
Mr. Zhao, please take good care of me
in the future.

104
00:04:38,160 --> 00:04:39,350
Let's take care of each other.

105
00:04:49,560 --> 00:04:50,279
Mingzhu.

106
00:04:51,039 --> 00:04:52,479
How is it over at Mom's?

107
00:04:52,479 --> 00:04:53,919
Everything's prepared. Don't worry.

108
00:04:58,919 --> 00:04:59,560
Ms. Feng,

109
00:05:00,610 --> 00:05:02,350
you'll manage the restaurant
in the future.

110
00:05:02,440 --> 00:05:03,320
I'll help you out.

111
00:05:05,900 --> 00:05:06,960
(Nanxi Hotel
Food and Beverage Department Contract)

112
00:05:06,960 --> 00:05:07,719
I hope you do well.

113
00:05:14,080 --> 00:05:15,200
What's wrong with you?

114
00:05:15,760 --> 00:05:16,880
What's that reaction?

115
00:05:17,060 --> 00:05:18,580
Shouldn't you cry when you're touched?

116
00:05:18,599 --> 00:05:19,399
It's different.

117
00:05:19,399 --> 00:05:20,320
I'm going to the toilet.

118
00:05:21,560 --> 00:05:22,159
That's...

119
00:05:25,279 --> 00:05:26,399
Who is it?

120
00:05:28,080 --> 00:05:28,760
Wait.

121
00:05:39,799 --> 00:05:41,120
Is she all right?

122
00:06:15,290 --> 00:06:16,840
How many times have you been pregnant?

123
00:06:18,080 --> 00:06:18,860
It's my first time.

124
00:06:20,290 --> 00:06:21,440
Why don't you want the child?

125
00:06:22,560 --> 00:06:23,799
I'm not married yet.

126
00:06:26,200 --> 00:06:27,960
Children born to a single mother

127
00:06:27,970 --> 00:06:29,860
can also be registered
to the family household.

128
00:06:31,039 --> 00:06:32,320
Getting registered is easy

129
00:06:33,359 --> 00:06:35,000
but raising a child is difficult.

130
00:06:35,479 --> 00:06:36,560
If you know

131
00:06:36,640 --> 00:06:38,560
it's a problem
that can be solved by a condom,

132
00:06:39,039 --> 00:06:39,839
why must you wait

133
00:06:39,839 --> 00:06:41,080
until an abortion surgery?

134
00:06:42,159 --> 00:06:43,239
It's bad for your body.

135
00:06:44,799 --> 00:06:46,399
It's too late to regret it now.

136
00:06:48,440 --> 00:06:50,520
I want it to be done
on the 14th or 15th.

137
00:06:50,520 --> 00:06:51,159
Is that OK?

138
00:06:51,159 --> 00:06:52,399
You need to do a checkup first.

139
00:06:52,410 --> 00:06:54,760
If everything's fine,
we can schedule the time of operation.

140
00:06:56,239 --> 00:06:57,399
Let me give you a receipt.

141
00:07:01,760 --> 00:07:02,320
Hello.

142
00:07:02,360 --> 00:07:04,200
Let me know
how many people are in front of me

143
00:07:04,200 --> 00:07:05,440
and how long I have to wait.

144
00:07:09,120 --> 00:07:10,279
You are No. 156.

145
00:07:10,279 --> 00:07:12,000
You probably need another two hours.

146
00:07:13,239 --> 00:07:14,680
I'll come over later. Thank you.

147
00:07:16,440 --> 00:07:17,000
Meiqi.

148
00:07:17,120 --> 00:07:17,599
Mr. Guan.

149
00:07:17,599 --> 00:07:18,399
Why are you here?

150
00:07:18,460 --> 00:07:19,359
I came to take a look.

151
00:07:19,630 --> 00:07:21,239
It's time for lunch. Let's eat together.

152
00:07:21,239 --> 00:07:22,479
I'm not eating, Mr. Guan.

153
00:07:22,479 --> 00:07:23,320
I'm not that hungry.

154
00:07:23,760 --> 00:07:26,120
It's bad not to eat during meal hours.

155
00:07:26,479 --> 00:07:27,960
I've told you before.

156
00:07:27,960 --> 00:07:29,359
I used to do renovations.

157
00:07:29,359 --> 00:07:30,479
Rest assured.

158
00:07:30,479 --> 00:07:31,039
Yes.

159
00:07:31,359 --> 00:07:33,440
Thank you so much, Mr. Guan.

160
00:07:33,900 --> 00:07:35,719
But you are renovating
the banquet hall today.

161
00:07:35,719 --> 00:07:36,719
I still have many details

162
00:07:36,719 --> 00:07:38,000
to confirm with you.

163
00:07:38,120 --> 00:07:40,000
Sure. Let's go. Let's go and take a look.

164
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:40,839
Sure.

165
00:07:42,810 --> 00:07:45,050
Why did you forget the 4D Ultrasound
I arranged for you?

166
00:07:45,830 --> 00:07:47,719
I argued with my husband
and forgot about it.

167
00:07:47,719 --> 00:07:48,980
It has been changed to next week.

168
00:07:50,399 --> 00:07:51,000
Mr. Mao,

169
00:07:51,719 --> 00:07:53,120
I've sent the draft to the group.

170
00:07:53,120 --> 00:07:54,960
Please take a look when you're free.

171
00:07:55,719 --> 00:07:56,880
You're still as busy.

172
00:07:57,320 --> 00:07:59,839
I accepted a job
to promote a baby care product.

173
00:07:59,839 --> 00:08:01,150
I'm doing it until I give birth.

174
00:08:01,320 --> 00:08:04,080
I can earn the baby formula money
before the child turns one.

175
00:08:05,090 --> 00:08:07,060
You must be careful
about premature birth, then.

176
00:08:09,239 --> 00:08:09,960
Dr. Li.

177
00:08:10,640 --> 00:08:13,120
If it wasn't for your
close relationship with Mingzhu,

178
00:08:13,239 --> 00:08:15,120
I would never find a dull guy

179
00:08:15,120 --> 00:08:16,399
to find my attending doctor.

180
00:08:16,440 --> 00:08:17,799
Don't speak nonsense.

181
00:08:18,080 --> 00:08:19,680
We are normal friends.

182
00:08:19,719 --> 00:08:21,520
I was just joking.

183
00:08:21,530 --> 00:08:23,960
I was planning to give birth at the
Maternal and Child Healthcare

184
00:08:23,960 --> 00:08:25,260
because it's close to our house.

185
00:08:25,359 --> 00:08:26,159
To be closer to you,

186
00:08:26,159 --> 00:08:27,620
I transferred to the People's Hospital

187
00:08:27,880 --> 00:08:29,880
and made an appointment
with Dr. Li Jingzhe.

188
00:08:30,640 --> 00:08:31,880
The first day we met,

189
00:08:31,880 --> 00:08:33,879
he was being so sarcastic.

190
00:08:33,879 --> 00:08:34,560
I didn't.

191
00:08:34,560 --> 00:08:35,960
When she came to me,

192
00:08:36,040 --> 00:08:37,080
the first thing she told me

193
00:08:37,080 --> 00:08:38,790
was that middle-aged women
like to gossip.

194
00:08:39,400 --> 00:08:40,160
The gears of fate

195
00:08:40,160 --> 00:08:41,800
started turning at my place.

196
00:08:41,879 --> 00:08:42,999
They are not turning

197
00:08:43,639 --> 00:08:44,599
but vibrating.

198
00:08:45,160 --> 00:08:46,639
Turning is too smooth.

199
00:08:46,759 --> 00:08:47,839
Mingzhu's and my fate

200
00:08:47,839 --> 00:08:49,239
are a little out of control.

201
00:08:49,320 --> 00:08:51,400
No. Mine isn't out of control.
It's quite good.

202
00:08:53,080 --> 00:08:54,040
Hello, Hao.

203
00:08:56,960 --> 00:08:58,400
Jiao scratched Wu's car?

204
00:09:01,639 --> 00:09:02,800
Insurance company doesn't pay

205
00:09:02,800 --> 00:09:04,599
for manmade damages, right?

206
00:09:06,239 --> 00:09:06,800
Sure.

207
00:09:07,040 --> 00:09:08,560
Why is it so serious?

208
00:09:08,999 --> 00:09:09,759
I got it.

209
00:09:11,359 --> 00:09:11,920
Hao,

210
00:09:12,730 --> 00:09:13,479
what do you think?

211
00:09:13,960 --> 00:09:15,879
Wu, I'm really sorry.

212
00:09:19,879 --> 00:09:20,440
Jiao.

213
00:09:20,599 --> 00:09:21,160
Jiao.

214
00:09:21,839 --> 00:09:23,639
Apologize to Mr. Wu.

215
00:09:23,639 --> 00:09:24,560
I'm not apologizing.

216
00:09:24,570 --> 00:09:25,879
Pay him with my red packet money.

217
00:09:25,879 --> 00:09:28,400
- What are you talking about?
- Mr. Wu, I'm sorry.

218
00:09:29,400 --> 00:09:31,639
I'll pay for the repairs.

219
00:09:31,639 --> 00:09:32,200
Hao.

220
00:09:33,080 --> 00:09:35,119
It's a full spray.
That's about 6,000 yuan.

221
00:09:35,119 --> 00:09:36,080
I'll pay it.

222
00:09:36,080 --> 00:09:36,519
You'll pay?

223
00:09:36,519 --> 00:09:37,080
I'll pay.

224
00:09:37,280 --> 00:09:37,839
All right.

225
00:09:38,320 --> 00:09:39,200
Hao. Zhixia.

226
00:09:39,999 --> 00:09:41,320
Educate your child

227
00:09:41,960 --> 00:09:43,200
before society educates her.

228
00:09:44,519 --> 00:09:45,119
No. He...

229
00:09:45,599 --> 00:09:46,200
It's all right.

230
00:09:48,119 --> 00:09:49,400
Coming. Sorry.

231
00:09:49,400 --> 00:09:49,920
You're late.

232
00:09:58,800 --> 00:09:59,680
Pull up your shirt.

233
00:10:00,639 --> 00:10:01,479
Higher.

234
00:10:09,479 --> 00:10:10,680
I can see the gestational sac.

235
00:10:14,680 --> 00:10:16,320
My grandson might be asleep.

236
00:10:16,320 --> 00:10:17,680
I can't hear anything.

237
00:10:18,519 --> 00:10:19,960
Did he kick you today?

238
00:10:20,440 --> 00:10:21,440
Not today.

239
00:10:21,460 --> 00:10:22,879
He kicked me furiously two days ago.

240
00:10:27,440 --> 00:10:29,200
When I was pregnant with Jianqi,

241
00:10:29,519 --> 00:10:31,239
his arms

242
00:10:31,400 --> 00:10:32,519
would come out from here

243
00:10:32,519 --> 00:10:34,320
and his leg would come out from here.

244
00:10:34,320 --> 00:10:34,960
Then,

245
00:10:35,280 --> 00:10:37,119
I'd comfort him and put him back.

246
00:10:46,200 --> 00:10:47,479
I can see the gestational sac.

247
00:10:49,639 --> 00:10:51,320
There's a chocolate cyst here.

248
00:10:52,759 --> 00:10:53,800
If you get an abortion,

249
00:10:54,260 --> 00:10:55,940
pregnancy will be difficult
in the future.

250
00:10:56,200 --> 00:10:58,719
I suggest you think it through.

251
00:11:10,160 --> 00:11:11,080
Hello, Mingzhu.

252
00:11:11,479 --> 00:11:12,359
Hello, Meiqi.

253
00:11:12,680 --> 00:11:13,440
Where are you?

254
00:11:13,440 --> 00:11:14,540
Why haven't you come home?

255
00:11:16,410 --> 00:11:17,160
I'll go home soon.

256
00:11:18,160 --> 00:11:19,920
Don't wait for me.

257
00:11:40,280 --> 00:11:41,680
Do you think I have a lot of money?

258
00:11:41,980 --> 00:11:43,519
Do you think I have too few troubles?

259
00:11:43,719 --> 00:11:44,999
Tell me. Are you wrong?

260
00:11:45,160 --> 00:11:45,920
No.

261
00:11:48,320 --> 00:11:49,839
Don't be angry.

262
00:11:49,839 --> 00:11:51,040
You are still pregnant.

263
00:11:51,759 --> 00:11:53,200
This is not Jiao's fault.

264
00:11:55,599 --> 00:11:57,960
She saw me argue with Wu.

265
00:12:03,800 --> 00:12:04,999
You argued with Wu?

266
00:12:06,759 --> 00:12:08,160
Are you saying

267
00:12:08,839 --> 00:12:09,839
that she's avenging you?

268
00:12:17,440 --> 00:12:18,719
Jiao, all right.

269
00:12:18,719 --> 00:12:19,479
It's fine.

270
00:12:19,479 --> 00:12:20,160
Don't cry.

271
00:12:20,160 --> 00:12:22,040
- You must feel aggrieved.
- Sorry.

272
00:12:22,040 --> 00:12:23,519
Jiao is the most righteous person.

273
00:12:23,519 --> 00:12:25,400
Our Jiao is a heroine.

274
00:12:25,599 --> 00:12:26,359
What?

275
00:12:26,359 --> 00:12:28,119
Jiao, it's like this.

276
00:12:28,119 --> 00:12:28,719
Well,

277
00:12:29,759 --> 00:12:31,960
I know you are avenging Dad.

278
00:12:33,359 --> 00:12:35,680
However, you need
to choose the right way.

279
00:12:35,680 --> 00:12:37,080
You can choose a free method

280
00:12:37,080 --> 00:12:38,560
that doesn't spend my money.

281
00:12:38,800 --> 00:12:39,519
You...

282
00:12:40,400 --> 00:12:42,320
You could trip him

283
00:12:42,320 --> 00:12:44,639
so he would fall flat on his face.

284
00:12:44,759 --> 00:12:46,320
Then, quickly bow and say,

285
00:12:46,320 --> 00:12:47,479
"Sorry, Mr. Wu.

286
00:12:47,479 --> 00:12:48,960
I didn't do it on purpose."

287
00:12:49,280 --> 00:12:51,080
That's free. Isn't it great?

288
00:12:51,599 --> 00:12:52,839
You can educate her like this.

289
00:12:52,839 --> 00:12:53,800
How should I do it then?

290
00:12:54,999 --> 00:12:56,420
Keeping quiet while feeling aggrieved

291
00:12:56,440 --> 00:12:57,320
and be at a loss?

292
00:12:58,080 --> 00:12:58,759
Well done.

293
00:12:58,960 --> 00:12:59,519
Mom.

294
00:12:59,999 --> 00:13:01,920
Wu bullied Dad

295
00:13:01,999 --> 00:13:03,879
because Dad didn't get promoted.

296
00:13:05,400 --> 00:13:07,519
I'm the only one
who can force him to be the manager.

297
00:13:07,800 --> 00:13:08,879
You shouldn't say that.

298
00:13:12,719 --> 00:13:14,359
It's because you are not the manager.

299
00:13:35,999 --> 00:13:36,850
What's wrong with you?

300
00:13:37,160 --> 00:13:37,960
Are you pregnant?

301
00:14:00,440 --> 00:14:01,239
With whom?

302
00:14:05,040 --> 00:14:05,759
Well,

303
00:14:08,359 --> 00:14:11,519
after I resigned, I went to Shanghai.

304
00:14:12,400 --> 00:14:14,119
I met a lawyer, Simon.

305
00:14:14,550 --> 00:14:15,320
His surname is Yao.

306
00:14:16,359 --> 00:14:17,560
He once pursued me.

307
00:14:18,400 --> 00:14:18,999
So...

308
00:14:21,680 --> 00:14:22,800
Does he know about this?

309
00:14:24,960 --> 00:14:25,440
He doesn't.

310
00:14:27,160 --> 00:14:29,080
Call him and tell him now.

311
00:14:30,280 --> 00:14:31,519
I don't want to marry him.

312
00:14:32,920 --> 00:14:34,239
You don't want to marry him?

313
00:14:34,479 --> 00:14:36,519
Why are you
so irresponsible with yourself?

314
00:14:38,519 --> 00:14:39,879
What do you plan to do now?

315
00:14:42,160 --> 00:14:42,999
My original plan

316
00:14:43,719 --> 00:14:45,359
was to get an abortion on the 14th.

317
00:14:46,163 --> 00:14:47,879
After that, I'll rest for two weeks.

318
00:14:47,999 --> 00:14:50,719
The restaurant's renovation
will be done during this period.

319
00:14:51,040 --> 00:14:53,599
Removing formaldehyde,
moving furniture, and fire safety.

320
00:14:53,879 --> 00:14:55,839
I can use the time
without any interruption.

321
00:14:55,839 --> 00:14:56,560
It's easy to say.

322
00:14:56,560 --> 00:14:57,879
I'll be busy with the opening.

323
00:14:57,880 --> 00:14:59,119
I have no time to take care of you.

324
00:14:59,119 --> 00:15:00,080
I don't need anyone.

325
00:15:00,080 --> 00:15:01,050
I just need to lie down.

326
00:15:01,519 --> 00:15:02,839
When Madam Yue and Madam Yu

327
00:15:02,839 --> 00:15:04,719
deliver nutritious soup for you and Mom,

328
00:15:04,800 --> 00:15:06,239
I'll just have some.

329
00:15:06,359 --> 00:15:08,680
Consider that as
a nutritious confinement period.

330
00:15:09,080 --> 00:15:10,400
You planned it well.

331
00:15:11,960 --> 00:15:13,759
However, plans change.

332
00:15:15,960 --> 00:15:17,960
Doctor said I have a chocolate cyst.

333
00:15:19,080 --> 00:15:20,800
If I get an abortion,

334
00:15:21,560 --> 00:15:23,479
it'll be difficult for me
to get pregnant again.

335
00:15:28,400 --> 00:15:29,119
So,

336
00:15:30,999 --> 00:15:32,400
after thinking about it,

337
00:15:34,519 --> 00:15:36,800
I think this baby is here to save me.

338
00:15:37,390 --> 00:15:38,800
You want to give birth to the child?

339
00:15:41,119 --> 00:15:42,119
I don't know.

340
00:15:43,639 --> 00:15:45,320
What should I do, Mingzhu?

341
00:15:45,320 --> 00:15:46,400
You're asking me now?

342
00:15:47,460 --> 00:15:49,040
It's your child. Make your own decision.

343
00:15:49,639 --> 00:15:52,040
Why did you stop Bichen
when she wanted to get an abortion?

344
00:15:52,050 --> 00:15:54,150
Was it because her husband
was your younger brother?

345
00:15:54,320 --> 00:15:55,440
Because Yuan Bichen

346
00:15:55,440 --> 00:15:57,680
was about to marry Xu Zhidong back then.

347
00:16:03,280 --> 00:16:04,879
Is an abortion not recommended

348
00:16:05,320 --> 00:16:06,680
when one has a chocolate cyst?

349
00:16:06,879 --> 00:16:08,080
Yes. During pregnancy,

350
00:16:08,080 --> 00:16:10,080
Estrogen and
progesterone levels will rise.

351
00:16:10,200 --> 00:16:12,280
The cyst might
decrease in size or vanish completely.

352
00:16:12,280 --> 00:16:13,999
Menopause, too, is actually

353
00:16:13,999 --> 00:16:15,730
a way for the ovaries
to rest and recover.

354
00:16:18,519 --> 00:16:19,320
What's wrong?

355
00:16:21,519 --> 00:16:22,800
There's trouble again.

356
00:16:58,440 --> 00:16:59,479
Go back and rest.

357
00:17:00,440 --> 00:17:01,200
I'm not tired.

358
00:17:06,880 --> 00:17:09,160
I went to ask Dr. Li today.

359
00:17:11,039 --> 00:17:12,360
Why did you look for him?

360
00:17:13,680 --> 00:17:14,479
This is my problem.

361
00:17:14,479 --> 00:17:15,519
It's none of your business.

362
00:17:16,160 --> 00:17:16,799
I am the mother.

363
00:17:16,799 --> 00:17:17,950
I have a right to give birth.

364
00:17:18,999 --> 00:17:19,680
Yes.

365
00:17:19,999 --> 00:17:21,640
Every woman has a right to give birth

366
00:17:21,640 --> 00:17:23,799
but not every woman is suitable
to become a mother.

367
00:17:25,960 --> 00:17:27,880
Your biological mother
gave you away.

368
00:17:27,880 --> 00:17:29,360
Does she deserve to become a mother?

369
00:17:29,880 --> 00:17:31,960
Why didn't you scold her, but got closer

370
00:17:31,970 --> 00:17:32,950
to their family instead?

371
00:17:38,559 --> 00:17:39,400
Everyone,

372
00:17:40,079 --> 00:17:41,759
take a break and get a drink outside.

373
00:17:42,880 --> 00:17:44,079
- Sure.
- All right.

374
00:17:55,719 --> 00:17:56,479
Feng Meiqi.

375
00:17:57,360 --> 00:17:59,200
Did pregnancy make you
lose your conscience?

376
00:17:59,610 --> 00:18:00,860
When they rushed to the hospital

377
00:18:00,870 --> 00:18:02,799
to pay your mom's bills
when she was in the ICU,

378
00:18:02,799 --> 00:18:05,200
why didn't you say
she didn't deserve to become a mother?

379
00:18:05,920 --> 00:18:07,400
Now that you got pregnant accidentally

380
00:18:07,400 --> 00:18:08,500
and couldn't make a decision,

381
00:18:08,519 --> 00:18:10,300
you hope for everyone
to stand on your side.

382
00:18:10,360 --> 00:18:11,680
Do you think this is a drama?

383
00:18:12,200 --> 00:18:13,200
Meiqi, give birth to him.

384
00:18:13,200 --> 00:18:14,220
We'll raise him for you.

385
00:18:14,680 --> 00:18:15,360
What?

386
00:18:15,640 --> 00:18:16,799
Are you attacking all of us

387
00:18:16,960 --> 00:18:18,799
because we don't act
according to your script?

388
00:18:19,200 --> 00:18:20,400
Do we owe you anything?

389
00:18:20,640 --> 00:18:21,559
Look in the mirror.

390
00:18:21,559 --> 00:18:22,719
How old are you now?

391
00:18:23,039 --> 00:18:25,360
You don't want me
to give birth after all.

392
00:18:26,440 --> 00:18:28,440
No wonder
you hesitated so long back then.

393
00:18:28,440 --> 00:18:30,519
If my parents hadn't promised
to give you the house and money,

394
00:18:30,519 --> 00:18:31,519
you'd probably not give birth, right?

395
00:18:31,519 --> 00:18:32,950
Where's the house? Where's the money?

396
00:18:33,150 --> 00:18:34,360
I'm not talking to you anymore.

397
00:18:34,360 --> 00:18:35,400
Your child, your decision.

398
00:18:35,600 --> 00:18:36,799
My child, my decision.

399
00:19:06,060 --> 00:19:08,160
Drinking soup isn't enough
You need to eat the meat.

400
00:19:09,279 --> 00:19:10,079
Leave me alone.

401
00:20:02,239 --> 00:20:03,440
The nutrition is in the meat.

402
00:20:04,279 --> 00:20:05,600
The baby needs protein.

403
00:20:39,559 --> 00:20:41,479
All of you are ready to become mothers,

404
00:20:44,239 --> 00:20:46,319
but I'm not prepared at all.

405
00:20:49,239 --> 00:20:51,400
I wasn't prepared for my dad's death.

406
00:20:53,200 --> 00:20:55,840
I wasn't prepared
for my brother's death.

407
00:20:57,079 --> 00:20:58,319
I was also not prepared

408
00:20:58,319 --> 00:21:00,200
for Mom's stroke.

409
00:21:01,640 --> 00:21:02,920
Our family had to

410
00:21:02,920 --> 00:21:04,319
carry so much debt for no reason.

411
00:21:05,079 --> 00:21:07,719
I suddenly have a younger brother
for no reason.

412
00:21:08,279 --> 00:21:10,079
In the end, I even got pregnant.

413
00:21:13,719 --> 00:21:16,079
Why do things end up like this?

414
00:21:16,960 --> 00:21:19,479
But I'm not prepared for anything?

415
00:21:23,400 --> 00:21:24,279
Doesn't eating meat

416
00:21:25,559 --> 00:21:27,039
mean you are making preparations?

417
00:21:28,719 --> 00:21:30,559
What should I do?

418
00:21:34,880 --> 00:21:35,999
Think about it carefully.

419
00:21:36,960 --> 00:21:38,940
If you're getting an abortion,
I'll go with you.

420
00:21:39,999 --> 00:21:41,200
If you want to give birth,

421
00:21:42,460 --> 00:21:43,719
we'll raise the child together.

422
00:21:46,880 --> 00:21:48,350
We've really owed your family so much.

423
00:22:01,999 --> 00:22:02,880
Sorry.

424
00:22:05,200 --> 00:22:06,960
Sorry, Mingzhu.

425
00:22:08,120 --> 00:22:09,400

I calculated it.

435
00:22:42,918 --> 00:22:45,997
Our pregnancies are half a year apart.

436
00:22:47,719 --> 00:22:49,160
When you give birth, I'll work.

437
00:22:49,799 --> 00:22:50,799
When I give birth,

438
00:22:51,400 --> 00:22:51,960
you'll work.

439
00:22:55,680 --> 00:22:57,799
Who'll take care of your child
after you give birth?

440
00:22:58,719 --> 00:23:00,200
I'll take care of the child myself.

441
00:23:04,079 --> 00:23:04,960
Eat the meat.

444
00:23:19,719 --> 00:23:20,319
Look.

445
00:23:20,580 --> 00:23:21,519
Our names are together.

446
00:23:22,120 --> 00:23:22,999
Joint first.

447
00:23:24,300 --> 00:23:25,640
As long as the score is the same.

448
00:23:25,640 --> 00:23:27,840
Whether it's first or last,

449
00:23:27,840 --> 00:23:28,950
we are still joint together.

450
00:23:30,999 --> 00:23:31,640
Hu Gang.

451
00:23:32,079 --> 00:23:32,880
Let me ask you.

452
00:23:33,680 --> 00:23:35,200
Do you really not have anything to say

453
00:23:35,200 --> 00:23:36,759
about me buying Mingzhu's house?

454
00:23:38,559 --> 00:23:39,680
What's wrong with her house?

455
00:23:42,200 --> 00:23:43,279
Well,

456
00:23:43,687 --> 00:23:45,207
there'll be traces of Feng Meiqi.

457
00:23:48,160 --> 00:23:51,200
I can't see any traces.

458
00:23:51,880 --> 00:23:53,239
I'm a materialist.

459
00:23:54,350 --> 00:23:55,400
Do you really not see it?

460
00:23:56,239 --> 00:23:57,160
Are you sure?

461
00:23:57,479 --> 00:23:58,360
Are you sure?

462
00:24:15,279 --> 00:24:17,799
I remember I bought you
a pair of red shoes.

463
00:24:18,160 --> 00:24:19,640
You've never worn it before.

464
00:24:20,319 --> 00:24:21,279
If you have time,

465
00:24:21,279 --> 00:24:22,880
you should go and take a look

466
00:24:22,880 --> 00:24:23,880
at our original workshop.

467
00:24:24,400 --> 00:24:25,319
I'm not going.

468
00:24:25,960 --> 00:24:27,559
I've never been there for many years.

469
00:24:27,559 --> 00:24:29,200
That place must be so dirty

470
00:24:29,200 --> 00:24:30,120
and messy.

471
00:24:30,120 --> 00:24:31,120
Why should I go?

472
00:24:31,120 --> 00:24:32,799
It's exactly
because it's messy and dirty

473
00:24:32,799 --> 00:24:34,360
that you need to tidy it up.

474
00:24:35,279 --> 00:24:35,999
Remember.

475
00:24:36,559 --> 00:24:37,680
We achieved what we have

476
00:24:37,799 --> 00:24:39,559
by taking one step at a time.

477
00:24:47,880 --> 00:24:49,360
That is our blessed land.

478
00:25:01,239 --> 00:25:01,960
Meiqi.

479
00:25:03,759 --> 00:25:05,400
I have a few photos of Jianmei Workshop.

480
00:25:05,400 --> 00:25:06,600
Where did you put them?

481
00:25:07,160 --> 00:25:08,559
It's inside my room's drawer.

482
00:25:09,920 --> 00:25:10,519
All right.

483
00:25:10,799 --> 00:25:12,279
I want to look at them.

484
00:25:40,239 --> 00:25:42,319
- Slowly.
- You too.

485
00:25:42,840 --> 00:25:44,440
When do you plan to tell Mom?

486
00:25:44,440 --> 00:25:46,079
Feng Meiqi!

487
00:25:48,440 --> 00:25:49,079
Tell me.

488
00:25:50,519 --> 00:25:51,640
Who does the child belong to?

489
00:25:54,960 --> 00:25:55,799
Simon Yao.

490
00:25:56,960 --> 00:25:57,840
My former classmate.

491
00:25:57,840 --> 00:25:59,400
What's that name?

492
00:26:00,799 --> 00:26:02,400
What does he do?

493
00:26:02,400 --> 00:26:03,279
A lawyer.

494
00:26:04,920 --> 00:26:06,400
Fine. A lawyer.

495
00:26:07,600 --> 00:26:10,559
Go and

496
00:26:10,880 --> 00:26:11,920
call this lawyer here.

497
00:26:12,319 --> 00:26:13,719
I want to talk to him.

498
00:26:13,719 --> 00:26:14,880
It won't happen.

499
00:26:15,840 --> 00:26:16,880
He's in Shanghai.

500
00:26:17,079 --> 00:26:18,360
Even if he's on the moon,

501
00:26:19,440 --> 00:26:20,719
you must call him back

502
00:26:20,719 --> 00:26:21,640
and marry you!

503
00:26:24,260 --> 00:26:25,999
We aren't close.
I don't have his contact.

504
00:26:26,840 --> 00:26:27,960
Feng Meiqi,

505
00:26:28,559 --> 00:26:29,600
who are you?

506
00:26:30,060 --> 00:26:32,039
You slept with him
when you weren't close to him

507
00:26:32,039 --> 00:26:33,479
and got pregnant with his child?

508
00:26:33,479 --> 00:26:35,239
You're still talking as if you're right?

509
00:26:35,239 --> 00:26:37,079
I'm telling you.
You can't keep this child!

510
00:26:37,160 --> 00:26:38,160
A family like ours...

511
00:26:38,160 --> 00:26:39,600
What's wrong with a family like ours?

512
00:26:39,600 --> 00:26:40,920
Stop talking about this family!

513
00:26:40,920 --> 00:26:43,640
Our family is rare in Nanzhou
and unparalleled in the Ancient City!

514
00:26:43,660 --> 00:26:44,640
What are you talking about?

515
00:26:44,640 --> 00:26:45,759
What nonsense is this?

516
00:26:45,759 --> 00:26:46,920
Didn't we acquire

517
00:26:46,920 --> 00:26:48,079
Nanxi Hotel?

518
00:26:48,079 --> 00:26:49,479
We will rise again!

519
00:26:49,479 --> 00:26:49,999
Mom,

520
00:26:49,999 --> 00:26:51,200
we didn't acquire Nanxi Hotel.

521
00:26:51,200 --> 00:26:52,440
It's just
the food and beverage department.

522
00:26:52,440 --> 00:26:53,680
It's even the money we obtained
from selling the house.

523
00:26:53,680 --> 00:26:55,200
Sowe must get rid of this trouble.

524
00:26:55,200 --> 00:26:56,479
How is this a trouble?

525
00:26:56,479 --> 00:26:57,360
It's a life!

526
00:26:57,600 --> 00:26:58,200
Whatever I do

527
00:26:58,200 --> 00:26:59,200
is wrong.

528
00:26:59,200 --> 00:27:00,840
Listen, Mom! I'll give birth to this child!

529
00:27:00,840 --> 00:27:02,039
I dare you to speak again!

530
00:27:02,039 --> 00:27:03,239
And I will speak again!

531
00:27:03,410 --> 00:27:05,600
I'll give birth
and take care of this child on my own.

532
00:27:05,600 --> 00:27:07,039
No one has the right to stop me

533
00:27:07,400 --> 00:27:08,680
even if you are my mom.

534
00:27:10,160 --> 00:27:10,719
Mom,

535
00:27:12,060 --> 00:27:13,559
you are going to become a grandmother.

536
00:27:14,999 --> 00:27:16,120
Aren't you happy?

537
00:27:19,680 --> 00:27:20,479
Feng...

538
00:27:21,360 --> 00:27:22,200
Enough, Mom.

539
00:27:23,120 --> 00:27:24,200
You know

540
00:27:24,200 --> 00:27:25,319
Meiqi's temper.

541
00:27:26,279 --> 00:27:28,239
Go to Shanghai

542
00:27:28,640 --> 00:27:30,999
and find the lawyer.

543
00:27:31,319 --> 00:27:32,999
He must take responsibility.

544
00:27:33,120 --> 00:27:33,999
Meiqi

545
00:27:33,999 --> 00:27:35,400
cannot suffer a loss in silence

546
00:27:35,400 --> 00:27:36,759
for no reason.

547
00:27:37,060 --> 00:27:39,310
I'm busy with the opening
and have had no time recently.

548
00:27:39,600 --> 00:27:41,239
I'll find my younger brother, Minghui,

549
00:27:41,239 --> 00:27:42,519
and ask him to go to Shanghai.

550
00:27:42,519 --> 00:27:43,200
Yes. That's right.

551
00:27:43,200 --> 00:27:45,559
- Minghui!
- Minghui, come upstairs!

552
00:27:46,240 --> 00:27:47,039
What is it, Mingzhu?

553
00:27:47,039 --> 00:27:49,239
I'll ask him to go instead. Calm down.

554
00:27:49,479 --> 00:27:50,239
What's wrong?

555
00:27:51,440 --> 00:27:53,200
Go to Shanghai and find someone for me.

556
00:27:54,079 --> 00:27:54,880
Who?

557
00:27:54,880 --> 00:27:56,239
A lawyer called Yao.

558
00:27:56,319 --> 00:27:58,319
He works at a firm in Jing'an.

559
00:27:58,479 --> 00:28:00,239
I'll send you the address later.

560
00:28:01,680 --> 00:28:03,120
Sure.

561
00:28:03,319 --> 00:28:04,120
Minghui,

562
00:28:04,120 --> 00:28:05,479
I beg you.

563
00:28:05,479 --> 00:28:07,519
You must go to Shanghai,
find the lawyer called Yao,

564
00:28:07,519 --> 00:28:08,559
and bring him back.

565
00:28:09,039 --> 00:28:10,840
He must take responsibility for Meiqi.

566
00:28:12,640 --> 00:28:15,519
Meiqi is pregnant with his child.

567
00:28:18,559 --> 00:28:19,559
I'll go immediately.

568
00:28:19,559 --> 00:28:21,279
Let me pack up
and I'll depart tomorrow morning.

569
00:28:21,279 --> 00:28:21,640
Sure.

570
00:28:21,640 --> 00:28:23,060
- Thank you, Minghui.
- Don't worry, Mrs. Feng.

571
00:28:23,079 --> 00:28:25,239
Thank you, Minghui.

572
00:28:27,160 --> 00:28:28,559
It's all right.

573
00:28:29,160 --> 00:28:30,479
Let me bring you to rest.

574
00:28:31,360 --> 00:28:32,160
Why would

575
00:28:32,160 --> 00:28:34,079
Mingzhu suddenly become pregnant?

576
00:28:34,079 --> 00:28:34,880
Right. I wonder.

577
00:28:34,880 --> 00:28:36,600
She said she wasn't close to him.

578
00:28:38,759 --> 00:28:39,360
Mingzhu.

579
00:28:40,759 --> 00:28:42,559
Will Minghui really go to Shanghai?

580
00:28:42,840 --> 00:28:45,079
No. He didn't ask for money from me.

581
00:28:45,680 --> 00:28:46,319
All right.

582
00:28:51,999 --> 00:28:52,799
Hello, Minghui.

583
00:28:53,319 --> 00:28:53,840
Mingzhu,

584
00:28:54,039 --> 00:28:55,840
send me Yao's details.

585
00:28:56,719 --> 00:28:58,120
Are you really going to Shanghai?

586
00:28:58,239 --> 00:28:59,680
(Nanzhou Station)
Yes. I'm at the High Speed Rail station.

587
00:28:59,920 --> 00:29:00,960
Let me talk to him.

588
00:29:01,999 --> 00:29:03,079
Minghui, listen to me.

589
00:29:03,079 --> 00:29:04,830
Don't go. You won't find him
even if you go there.

590
00:29:04,840 --> 00:29:05,740
Come back immediately.

591
00:29:06,999 --> 00:29:07,880
Go home.

592
00:29:08,039 --> 00:29:08,640
Mingzhu,

593
00:29:08,840 --> 00:29:09,840
I was joking.

594
00:29:10,070 --> 00:29:11,880
I only came to the station
to take a picture.

595
00:29:12,140 --> 00:29:13,999
Don't you know
how smart your mother-in-law is?

596
00:29:14,293 --> 00:29:15,894
We must complete the whole act.

597
00:29:15,960 --> 00:29:18,440
You are right. Come back
as soon as you are done taking pictures.

598
00:29:18,440 --> 00:29:19,279
Stay safe.

599
00:29:19,479 --> 00:29:20,559
Got it.

600
00:29:20,759 --> 00:29:21,360
I'm hanging up.

601
00:29:22,440 --> 00:29:23,719
Take pictures of what?

602
00:29:24,140 --> 00:29:25,680
He is worried
that your mom might not believe him

603
00:29:25,680 --> 00:29:26,999
so he went to take pictures
at the railway station.

604
00:29:29,840 --> 00:29:32,319
What do you think?
Is my younger brother smart?

605
00:29:32,759 --> 00:29:33,319
All right.

606
00:29:33,460 --> 00:29:35,270
He only studied for five years
in high school.

607
00:29:35,600 --> 00:29:36,239
Yes.

608
00:29:36,360 --> 00:29:38,600
You are an ace student
and you are smart.

609
00:29:38,600 --> 00:29:39,640
Let me ask you.

610
00:29:39,799 --> 00:29:41,400
Do you want to inform

611
00:29:41,400 --> 00:29:42,319
the lawyer called Yao?

612
00:29:42,319 --> 00:29:42,880
No.

613
00:29:43,680 --> 00:29:45,490
I don't want
to guilt-trip him with a child.

614
00:29:45,490 --> 00:29:47,479
It's not guilt-tripping.
Both of you did it willingly

615
00:29:47,479 --> 00:29:48,999
and he didn't use any contraceptives.

616
00:29:49,127 --> 00:29:51,046
You can get
half of the child support fee.

617
00:29:57,279 --> 00:29:57,920
Doctor.

618
00:29:59,200 --> 00:30:00,519
Do many people ask

619
00:30:00,519 --> 00:30:02,519
whether it's a boy or a girl?

620
00:30:03,440 --> 00:30:05,079
We won't tell no matter what.

621
00:30:08,840 --> 00:30:10,200
Try to turn to the side

622
00:30:10,279 --> 00:30:11,400
and let me take a good look.

623
00:30:18,400 --> 00:30:19,319
What's wrong?

624
00:30:19,319 --> 00:30:20,759
Is something wrong?

625
00:30:21,880 --> 00:30:22,960
There's a small problem.

626
00:30:22,960 --> 00:30:24,079
Is your husband here?

627
00:30:25,400 --> 00:30:26,759
Yes. He's outside.

628
00:30:28,039 --> 00:30:29,440
Can you ask him to come inside?

629
00:30:31,160 --> 00:30:32,079
His name is Zhang Hao.

630
00:30:37,440 --> 00:30:38,160
Zhang Hao.

631
00:30:38,239 --> 00:30:38,799
Yes.

632
00:30:43,479 --> 00:30:44,079
Thank you.

633
00:30:44,600 --> 00:30:45,640
What's wrong?

634
00:30:47,640 --> 00:30:50,039
There's an extra finger
on the child's left hand.

635
00:30:51,759 --> 00:30:52,600
It's fine.

636
00:30:53,200 --> 00:30:54,200
There's no need to worry.

637
00:30:54,200 --> 00:30:54,960
It's a small issue.

638
00:30:55,319 --> 00:30:56,680
When the baby is three months old,

639
00:30:56,680 --> 00:30:58,360
you can remove it with surgery.

640
00:30:59,319 --> 00:31:00,319
Is it dangerous?

641
00:31:00,440 --> 00:31:02,200
It's not dangerous. Don't worry.

642
00:31:02,640 --> 00:31:03,640
Just a small issue.

643
00:31:03,640 --> 00:31:04,519
It's fine.

644
00:31:04,600 --> 00:31:06,079
However, I suggest you

645
00:31:06,079 --> 00:31:07,239
find your attending doctor

646
00:31:07,239 --> 00:31:08,200
to take another look.

647
00:31:14,120 --> 00:31:15,360
It's all right.

648
00:31:25,799 --> 00:31:26,600
Let's try this.

649
00:31:36,039 --> 00:31:36,719
Chef Liu,

650
00:31:36,719 --> 00:31:37,640
thank you.

651
00:31:38,160 --> 00:31:39,400
We'll have a chat about this.

652
00:31:39,960 --> 00:31:41,940
Why don't you go back
and wait for our updates?

653
00:31:41,999 --> 00:31:42,360
Sure.

654
00:31:42,360 --> 00:31:42,880
Thank you.

655
00:31:42,880 --> 00:31:44,239
All right. Call me anytime.

656
00:31:44,239 --> 00:31:44,719
Sure.

657
00:31:50,680 --> 00:31:51,840
It's so sickening.

658
00:31:51,840 --> 00:31:53,330
- When I first took that bite.
- Me too.

659
00:31:57,640 --> 00:31:58,400
Mingzhu,

660
00:31:59,600 --> 00:32:00,960
your family runs a restaurant.

661
00:32:01,400 --> 00:32:02,279
I'm sure you know

662
00:32:02,279 --> 00:32:04,039
how important a good chef is.

663
00:32:04,079 --> 00:32:05,039
Of course.

664
00:32:05,479 --> 00:32:07,120
Our problem now is

665
00:32:07,790 --> 00:32:08,911
we can't afford

666
00:32:09,400 --> 00:32:10,400
to pay good chefs

667
00:32:10,960 --> 00:32:13,079
and the chefs we can afford to pay
aren't good.

668
00:32:13,560 --> 00:32:14,600
It's a never-ending cycle.

669
00:32:16,039 --> 00:32:16,920
Finding a good chef

670
00:32:16,920 --> 00:32:18,640
is just like finding a good boyfriend.

671
00:32:18,719 --> 00:32:19,460
They are difficult.

672
00:32:20,519 --> 00:32:22,640
It's all right. Let's be patient.

673
00:32:22,640 --> 00:32:24,039
I'm sure we can find the right one.

674
00:32:24,200 --> 00:32:25,319
I hope so.

675
00:32:26,880 --> 00:32:27,680
God bless us.

676
00:32:27,680 --> 00:32:30,279
A good chef who is affordable,

677
00:32:30,279 --> 00:32:32,319
please appear soon.

678
00:32:32,319 --> 00:32:33,319
Come here, Zhu.

679
00:32:33,503 --> 00:32:34,063
Come.

680
00:32:35,719 --> 00:32:36,799
It's not bad.

681
00:32:37,360 --> 00:32:38,880
- What do you think?
- It's luxurious.

682
00:32:39,440 --> 00:32:40,160
Yes, it is.

683
00:32:40,360 --> 00:32:41,079
Zhilu.

684
00:32:41,160 --> 00:32:41,719
Mr. Xu.

685
00:32:41,719 --> 00:32:42,880
Slowly.

686
00:32:43,079 --> 00:32:45,239
I renovated this place with Meiqi.

687
00:32:45,640 --> 00:32:46,759
We wanted to give our guests

688
00:32:46,759 --> 00:32:48,039
a good experience.

689
00:32:48,680 --> 00:32:49,479
Not bad.

690
00:32:49,479 --> 00:32:50,079
All right.

691
00:32:50,310 --> 00:32:52,740
If you like this place so much,
why don't you book two tables?

692
00:32:53,200 --> 00:32:54,239
When you open,

693
00:32:54,240 --> 00:32:55,870
I'll support you
by reserving two tables.

694
00:32:55,880 --> 00:32:57,920
If you support us
and we still make you spend money,

695
00:32:57,920 --> 00:32:59,120
we are really bad at business.

696
00:32:59,120 --> 00:33:00,640
Exactly. I'm just joking.

697
00:33:00,719 --> 00:33:02,560
How can I support you
without spending money?

698
00:33:02,999 --> 00:33:03,640
It's free.

699
00:33:03,890 --> 00:33:04,880
Drinks are on us as well.

700
00:33:05,759 --> 00:33:06,999
Sure. Anything you say.

701
00:33:08,360 --> 00:33:08,960
Are both of you

702
00:33:08,960 --> 00:33:10,440
looking for a chef now?

703
00:33:12,960 --> 00:33:14,440
Zhu, come here.

704
00:33:16,960 --> 00:33:18,960
This is the chef I'm introducing you to.

705
00:33:19,999 --> 00:33:20,600
Chef,

706
00:33:20,960 --> 00:33:22,479
where did you cook before this?

707
00:33:22,760 --> 00:33:24,519
He was the sous chef
at Jinling Restaurant.

708
00:33:24,640 --> 00:33:25,759
Jinling Restaurant?

709
00:33:26,719 --> 00:33:27,400
He's amazing.

710
00:33:28,960 --> 00:33:29,840
Chef Zhu.

711
00:33:29,960 --> 00:33:31,640
If you are
Jinling Restaurant's sous chef,

712
00:33:31,719 --> 00:33:33,279
I'm sure you are incredibly skilled.

713
00:33:33,400 --> 00:33:34,759
Naturally, you can also handle

714
00:33:34,759 --> 00:33:36,120
big and small banquets.

715
00:33:36,479 --> 00:33:38,559
However, I'll be honest with you.

716
00:33:38,559 --> 00:33:40,120
We just took over this place.

717
00:33:40,479 --> 00:33:42,120
We need to spend money on everything.

718
00:33:42,479 --> 00:33:43,600
Our budget...

719
00:33:43,920 --> 00:33:44,759
Zhilu,

720
00:33:44,759 --> 00:33:45,999
no matter what,

721
00:33:45,999 --> 00:33:48,600
you are also the boss of a restaurant.

722
00:33:48,880 --> 00:33:50,999
No one talks about pay immediately.

723
00:33:51,440 --> 00:33:53,880
The procedure of hiring a chef

724
00:33:54,239 --> 00:33:56,360
is to first try his cooking

725
00:33:56,440 --> 00:33:57,920
before discussing his pay.

726
00:33:58,079 --> 00:33:59,079
Am I right, Zhu?

727
00:33:59,079 --> 00:33:59,640
Yes.

728
00:34:00,479 --> 00:34:02,120
Why don't you try my cooking first?

729
00:34:02,440 --> 00:34:04,640
The rest can wait until later.

730
00:34:06,120 --> 00:34:06,960
That works.

731
00:34:27,119 --> 00:34:28,240
Hurry, try them.

732
00:34:28,599 --> 00:34:29,360
Bosses.

733
00:34:39,999 --> 00:34:40,760
Try this.

734
00:34:47,559 --> 00:34:49,479
Chef Zhu, you cook really well.

735
00:34:51,800 --> 00:34:52,599
Amazing.

736
00:34:52,960 --> 00:34:53,599
Right?

737
00:34:54,260 --> 00:34:54,960
What do you think?

738
00:34:54,960 --> 00:34:56,119
It's really delicious.

739
00:34:57,320 --> 00:34:58,639
Great. You're amazing.

740
00:34:58,639 --> 00:35:00,119
Chef Zhu, sit down.

741
00:35:00,639 --> 00:35:01,240
All right.

742
00:35:04,039 --> 00:35:04,999
We are very satisfied

743
00:35:04,999 --> 00:35:06,639
with the dishes you make.

744
00:35:07,240 --> 00:35:08,280
I wonder

745
00:35:08,639 --> 00:35:10,479
what is

746
00:35:10,479 --> 00:35:11,400
your expected pay.

747
00:35:15,079 --> 00:35:15,800
Zhilu,

748
00:35:16,119 --> 00:35:18,119
don't trouble him.

749
00:35:18,479 --> 00:35:19,280
Just tell him

750
00:35:19,280 --> 00:35:20,599
how much you can pay him a month.

751
00:35:22,260 --> 00:35:24,060
It's better
to let us know your expected pay.

752
00:35:25,119 --> 00:35:25,760
Me?

753
00:35:27,119 --> 00:35:27,920
Sure.

754
00:35:29,360 --> 00:35:30,280
Can we do

755
00:35:31,360 --> 00:35:32,320
8,000 yuan a month?

756
00:35:34,280 --> 00:35:34,999
8,000 yuan?

757
00:35:35,760 --> 00:35:37,519
8,000 yuan? Are you joking?

758
00:35:37,519 --> 00:35:38,119
No.

759
00:35:38,920 --> 00:35:40,240
But can we skip

760
00:35:40,240 --> 00:35:41,840
the probation period?

761
00:35:41,840 --> 00:35:42,999
Sure. No problem.

762
00:35:43,159 --> 00:35:44,159
It's decided, then.

763
00:35:44,280 --> 00:35:45,960
Then...

764
00:35:46,840 --> 00:35:47,400
Wait.

765
00:35:47,920 --> 00:35:49,880
See? You're thinking nonsense again.

766
00:35:50,400 --> 00:35:51,639
Chef Zhu

767
00:35:51,639 --> 00:35:52,999
is loyal.

768
00:35:53,920 --> 00:35:55,760
I saved him before.

769
00:35:56,400 --> 00:35:58,400
Now, it's time for him to pay me back.

770
00:35:58,519 --> 00:35:59,760
All right. It's decided, then.

771
00:35:59,920 --> 00:36:01,039
Dacheng is right.

772
00:36:01,519 --> 00:36:02,800
He is my savior.

773
00:36:02,999 --> 00:36:04,519
It's what I'm supposed to do.

774
00:36:06,312 --> 00:36:08,952
Both of you are hiring a chef

775
00:36:09,240 --> 00:36:11,519
and Chef Zhu
is making money with his skills.

776
00:36:11,559 --> 00:36:12,479
It's just that simple.

777
00:36:12,479 --> 00:36:13,400
Meiqi, am I right?

778
00:36:13,840 --> 00:36:14,760
Thank you, Mr. Xu.

779
00:36:15,559 --> 00:36:17,400
I'll bring Chef Zhu
to sign the contract.

780
00:36:17,400 --> 00:36:18,400
Go on.

781
00:36:18,400 --> 00:36:19,360
This way, Mr. Zhu.

782
00:36:19,880 --> 00:36:20,800
Both of you,

783
00:36:20,800 --> 00:36:22,320
please take good care of me.

784
00:36:26,400 --> 00:36:27,240
8,000 yuan?

785
00:36:27,639 --> 00:36:28,920
Don't overthink.

786
00:36:30,119 --> 00:36:32,119
The renovation is nice.

787
00:36:32,119 --> 00:36:33,679
Did you design it yourself

788
00:36:33,679 --> 00:36:35,079
or did you hire someone to do it?

789
00:36:35,159 --> 00:36:36,920
We designed everything.

790
00:36:37,880 --> 00:36:38,800
How interesting.

791
00:36:39,320 --> 00:36:42,079
It's really interesting
to hang bedsheets on the ceiling.

792
00:36:42,760 --> 00:36:43,610
We don't have money.

793
00:37:03,280 --> 00:37:03,840
Mom.

794
00:37:04,479 --> 00:37:05,320
What are you doing?

795
00:37:05,330 --> 00:37:07,500
What am I doing? What kind of trouble
are you causing again?

796
00:37:07,519 --> 00:37:09,479
No. This is serious.

797
00:37:09,880 --> 00:37:10,840
Is Madam He here?

798
00:37:11,840 --> 00:37:13,360
How rude of you.

799
00:37:13,559 --> 00:37:14,320
Ms. He.

800
00:37:14,320 --> 00:37:15,199
Is Ms. He home?

801
00:37:15,199 --> 00:37:16,440
Are you looking for her? Why?

802
00:37:16,450 --> 00:37:18,540
Why am I looking for her?
I'm trying to avoid her.

803
00:37:18,639 --> 00:37:19,119
Wait.

804
00:37:19,119 --> 00:37:21,210
What are you doing?
You look like you're in a rush.

805
00:37:21,440 --> 00:37:22,199
Don't worry.

806
00:37:23,639 --> 00:37:24,559
Don't cause trouble!

807
00:37:34,800 --> 00:37:35,639
Why are you here?

808
00:37:37,960 --> 00:37:39,720
Shouldn't you be in Shanghai?

809
00:37:41,599 --> 00:37:42,440
Ms. He,

810
00:37:43,400 --> 00:37:44,479
hear me out.

811
00:37:44,479 --> 00:37:45,599
What is it?

812
00:37:46,559 --> 00:37:48,599
Something so serious happened to Meiqi.

813
00:37:49,400 --> 00:37:50,840
Ask your conscience.

814
00:37:50,980 --> 00:37:52,920
Do you think it's too much
for me to make such a request

815
00:37:52,920 --> 00:37:54,280
as her mom?

816
00:37:55,639 --> 00:37:56,479
Great.

817
00:37:57,559 --> 00:37:59,479
All of you worked together
and lied to me.

818
00:37:59,800 --> 00:38:01,280
You won't go, right?

819
00:38:02,519 --> 00:38:05,280
Fine. I'll go there on my own.

820
00:38:05,800 --> 00:38:06,440
Move.

821
00:38:06,639 --> 00:38:07,240
Ms. He.

822
00:38:07,800 --> 00:38:09,639
There are so many people in Shanghai.

823
00:38:09,840 --> 00:38:10,760
We have no details.

824
00:38:10,760 --> 00:38:11,950
How are we supposed to find him?

825
00:38:12,639 --> 00:38:14,479
We have enough troubling matters at home.

826
00:38:15,039 --> 00:38:16,519
If something happens to you,

827
00:38:17,119 --> 00:38:17,920
what should we do?

828
00:38:18,960 --> 00:38:20,999
This is none of your business.

829
00:38:21,639 --> 00:38:22,360
Ms. He,

830
00:38:22,360 --> 00:38:23,999
how are you going to Shanghai alone?

831
00:38:24,920 --> 00:38:26,639
This isn't as simple as you think.

832
00:38:28,159 --> 00:38:29,159
Listen to me.

833
00:38:29,360 --> 00:38:30,519
We shouldn't go

834
00:38:31,210 --> 00:38:33,350
so it also makes my life easier
when I deal with them.

835
00:38:34,119 --> 00:38:35,280
Don't trouble everyone.

836
00:38:37,360 --> 00:38:37,920
Fine.

837
00:38:38,519 --> 00:38:40,240
I don't need to go to Shanghai,

838
00:38:40,639 --> 00:38:42,920
but you need to go to
another place with me.

839
00:38:43,760 --> 00:38:44,840
It's in Nanzhou.

840
00:38:44,999 --> 00:38:46,119
It's in Nanzhou?

841
00:38:48,119 --> 00:38:50,639
Sure. I can go anywhere in Nanzhou.

842
00:38:58,479 --> 00:38:59,550
(We achieved what we have)

843
00:38:59,720 --> 00:39:01,320
(by taking one step at a time.)

844
00:39:01,639 --> 00:39:03,159
(That is our blessed land.)

845
00:39:24,599 --> 00:39:25,159
Hold it.

846
00:39:27,039 --> 00:39:27,920
Hold it for me.

847
00:39:27,920 --> 00:39:28,760
Be careful, Ms. He.

848
00:39:38,599 --> 00:39:39,440
Be careful, Ms. He.

849
00:39:40,119 --> 00:39:40,679
Come here.

850
00:39:44,960 --> 00:39:45,800
This table.

851
00:39:47,360 --> 00:39:49,079
We used to eat here.

852
00:39:50,159 --> 00:39:51,679
Back then, we didn't have much money

853
00:39:52,240 --> 00:39:53,920
and we ate simple food,

854
00:39:54,519 --> 00:39:56,800
but everything tasted delicious.

855
00:40:00,039 --> 00:40:00,760
Ms. He,

856
00:40:01,479 --> 00:40:03,920
you had a difficult life back then.

857
00:40:04,960 --> 00:40:05,960
Perhaps one day,

858
00:40:06,280 --> 00:40:08,440
the Shen's restaurant will be
as good as Lijun Hotel's.

859
00:40:08,999 --> 00:40:10,679
That depends on how good you are.

860
00:40:11,840 --> 00:40:13,559
This is our first machine.

861
00:40:14,280 --> 00:40:15,440
We used it

862
00:40:15,999 --> 00:40:17,599
to make our first pot of gold.

863
00:40:21,039 --> 00:40:22,240
This is our second machine.

864
00:40:23,960 --> 00:40:27,079
The third, the fourth, the fifth...

865
00:40:50,060 --> 00:40:51,039
(Natural Mulberry Silk)

866
00:40:51,039 --> 00:40:52,800
Minghui, come here.
Help me remove the tarp.

867
00:40:59,920 --> 00:41:01,599
Come. Take them down.

868
00:41:02,400 --> 00:41:02,999
These are...

869
00:41:04,240 --> 00:41:05,119
Open it.

870
00:41:06,720 --> 00:41:07,920
What is this, Ms. He?

871
00:41:09,079 --> 00:41:09,720
What is this?

872
00:41:12,720 --> 00:41:13,720
Is this worth anything?

873
00:41:14,800 --> 00:41:15,479
Money.

874
00:41:17,639 --> 00:41:18,920
This is all money.

875
00:41:23,559 --> 00:41:24,920
This is all money.

876
00:41:24,920 --> 00:41:25,860
(For Lihua)

877
00:41:34,119 --> 00:41:34,760
(Lihua.)

878
00:41:35,199 --> 00:41:36,440
(Many things have happened)

879
00:41:36,440 --> 00:41:37,720
(to the company.)

880
00:41:37,920 --> 00:41:40,119
(I don't know whether it's good or bad.)

881
00:41:40,240 --> 00:41:43,119
(So, I made some preparations.)

882
00:41:43,440 --> 00:41:45,400
(It might help you in the future.)

883
00:41:45,752 --> 00:41:47,551
(However, I hope you don't need it.)

884
00:41:49,760 --> 00:41:50,760
(Xiaoqi is)

885
00:41:50,760 --> 00:41:52,800
(one of my life's biggest mistakes.)

886
00:41:53,400 --> 00:41:55,960
(Until today,
I still can't make up for it.)

887
00:41:56,479 --> 00:41:58,199
(I can only
leave these materials to you.)

888
00:41:58,479 --> 00:41:59,519
(I hope you and Meiqi)

889
00:42:00,079 --> 00:42:02,519
(can live a good life in the future.)

890
00:42:03,320 --> 00:42:04,760
(I've let this family,)

891
00:42:05,280 --> 00:42:07,840
(you, and the children down.)

892
00:42:08,760 --> 00:42:10,650
(There are
too many unexpected things in life.)

893
00:42:11,440 --> 00:42:13,199
(You must take good care of yourself)

894
00:42:14,440 --> 00:42:15,920
(and Meiqi.)

895
00:42:32,760 --> 00:42:33,880
I'm going to Shanghai.

896
00:42:36,280 --> 00:42:38,599
I want to meet Yao, the lawyer.

897
00:42:41,840 --> 00:42:43,119
