(Adapted from iceread.com novel

00:01:14,980 --> 00:01:18,130
=Episode 36=

4
00:01:19,119 --> 00:01:19,919
Ni, take a look.

5
00:01:20,960 --> 00:01:22,600
What do you think of our new

6
00:01:22,600 --> 00:01:23,559
renovation style?

7
00:01:29,479 --> 00:01:30,839
Please, this way.

8
00:01:31,080 --> 00:01:31,640
Okay.

9
00:01:33,160 --> 00:01:33,640
Mr. Zhao.

10
00:01:33,640 --> 00:01:34,160
Mingzhu.

11
00:01:36,720 --> 00:01:37,720
These two guests

12
00:01:37,720 --> 00:01:38,640
are my friends.

13
00:01:38,839 --> 00:01:40,800
Make sure you take good care of them.

14
00:01:41,600 --> 00:01:43,080
- Hello, I'm Shen Mingzhu.

15
00:01:43,080 --> 00:01:43,640
Hi.

16
00:01:44,039 --> 00:01:44,759
These days,

17
00:01:44,759 --> 00:01:45,919
all our restaurant operations

18
00:01:45,919 --> 00:01:47,279
are handled by Shen Mingzhu.

19
00:01:47,399 --> 00:01:49,679
So if you need anything,

20
00:01:49,679 --> 00:01:51,170
you can talk to Shen Mingzhu directly.

21
00:01:51,180 --> 00:01:52,710
She'll explain
and coordinate everything.

22
00:01:52,720 --> 00:01:53,399
Great.

23
00:01:53,720 --> 00:01:55,160
Why don't you guys discuss it?

24
00:01:55,160 --> 00:01:56,199
I'll get out of your hair.

25
00:01:56,199 --> 00:01:57,119
Thanks, Mr. Zhao.

26
00:01:57,119 --> 00:01:57,679
No problem.

27
00:01:57,880 --> 00:01:58,279
Thanks.

28
00:01:58,279 --> 00:01:59,360
Go ahead. It's fine.

29
00:02:00,199 --> 00:02:00,839
Ms. Shen,

30
00:02:01,500 --> 00:02:02,679
this banquet hall must've had

31
00:02:02,679 --> 00:02:04,039
a lot of thought put into it.

32
00:02:04,199 --> 00:02:05,080
How much did it cost?

33
00:02:05,880 --> 00:02:07,759
The renovation cost
about a hundred grand.

34
00:02:08,640 --> 00:02:09,719
A hundred thousand?

35
00:02:09,999 --> 00:02:11,279
And you got it looking like this?

36
00:02:12,480 --> 00:02:13,999
Miss Shen, you're seriously impressive.

37
00:02:14,220 --> 00:02:15,279
No need for the formality.

38
00:02:15,279 --> 00:02:16,320
Just call me Mingzhu.

39
00:02:16,559 --> 00:02:18,040
Since you're Mr. Zhao's friends,

40
00:02:18,040 --> 00:02:19,240
you're my friends too.

41
00:02:19,360 --> 00:02:21,399
I'll make sure
you're well taken care of.

42
00:02:21,599 --> 00:02:23,640
So, how may I help you?

43
00:02:25,599 --> 00:02:27,200
We want to book an engagement banquet.

44
00:02:27,599 --> 00:02:28,439
Yes, for the wedding.

45
00:02:29,559 --> 00:02:30,599
Let's sit down and talk.

46
00:02:30,960 --> 00:02:31,439
Okay.

47
00:02:37,320 --> 00:02:39,879
Then let me congratulate you in advance.

48
00:02:40,080 --> 00:02:41,200
- Thank you.
- Thanks.

49
00:02:41,599 --> 00:02:43,960
When are you planning to get married?

50
00:02:46,080 --> 00:02:47,080
Probably this fall.

51
00:02:47,080 --> 00:02:48,599
The most comfortable season of the year.

52
00:02:48,599 --> 00:02:49,800
Great choice.

53
00:02:50,040 --> 00:02:51,080
Clear skies, cool weather.

54
00:02:51,080 --> 00:02:52,559
Fall is perfect for weddings.

55
00:02:52,960 --> 00:02:53,520
By then,

56
00:02:53,520 --> 00:02:55,119
our banquet hall will already be open.

57
00:02:55,360 --> 00:02:57,119
If you decide to hold it here,

58
00:02:57,119 --> 00:02:57,999
we're confident

59
00:02:57,999 --> 00:02:59,279
we can give you

60
00:02:59,279 --> 00:03:00,679
a truly memorable wedding.

61
00:03:01,760 --> 00:03:02,839
As for the Nanxi Hotel,

62
00:03:02,839 --> 00:03:04,320
it's always had good taste.

63
00:03:04,320 --> 00:03:05,640
But it's been around a long time,

64
00:03:05,640 --> 00:03:06,750
it doesn't feel new anymore.

65
00:03:06,760 --> 00:03:08,119
So now, do you have

66
00:03:08,119 --> 00:03:09,559
any special recommendations?

67
00:03:09,960 --> 00:03:12,119
Nanxi Hotel does have a long history.

68
00:03:12,320 --> 00:03:13,960
But that's actually our charm.

69
00:03:13,960 --> 00:03:14,920
We've hosted

70
00:03:14,920 --> 00:03:16,960
a lot of traditional,
vintage-style weddings here.

71
00:03:17,240 --> 00:03:18,320
And after the renovation,

72
00:03:18,320 --> 00:03:19,679
we've added a wide range

73
00:03:19,679 --> 00:03:22,119
of modern, stylish wedding themes

74
00:03:22,119 --> 00:03:23,200
for people to choose from.

75
00:03:23,760 --> 00:03:26,119
We've also done
a lot of successful events recently.

76
00:03:26,119 --> 00:03:27,480
Our clients were very happy.

77
00:03:27,839 --> 00:03:28,879
I have some slides here.

78
00:03:28,879 --> 00:03:29,920
You can take a look.

79
00:03:32,839 --> 00:03:33,960
This one is French style.

80
00:03:38,320 --> 00:03:39,240
Have a nice day.

81
00:03:39,240 --> 00:03:39,679
Okay.

82
00:03:39,679 --> 00:03:40,760
- Thanks for your help.
- Bye.

83
00:03:40,760 --> 00:03:41,320
Bye.

84
00:03:43,040 --> 00:03:43,960
- Goodbye.
- Goodbye.

85
00:03:53,559 --> 00:03:54,200
Mingzhu.

86
00:03:54,200 --> 00:03:54,760
Mom.

87
00:03:55,060 --> 00:03:55,920
What brings you here?

88
00:03:56,640 --> 00:03:58,080
I brought you food.

89
00:03:58,399 --> 00:03:59,800
You've all been so busy lately.

90
00:03:59,800 --> 00:04:00,960
You haven't been eating well.

91
00:04:02,719 --> 00:04:03,999
You didn't have to make a trip.

92
00:04:04,159 --> 00:04:05,520
Of course I did.

93
00:04:08,439 --> 00:04:09,320
Mingzhu.

94
00:04:09,559 --> 00:04:12,559
I said something
I shouldn't have yesterday.

95
00:04:13,119 --> 00:04:14,240
I owe you an apology.

96
00:04:14,320 --> 00:04:15,240
What did you say?

97
00:04:16,060 --> 00:04:18,640
I shouldn't have said you were living
under someone else's roof.

98
00:04:18,640 --> 00:04:20,000
I was wrong. I'm sorry.

99
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:21,239
Mom, we're family.

100
00:04:21,359 --> 00:04:22,520
Don't take it to heart.

101
00:04:28,159 --> 00:04:28,799
Mingzhu.

102
00:04:30,039 --> 00:04:32,719
There's actually something else
I want to talk to you about.

103
00:04:34,279 --> 00:04:34,960
Go ahead.

104
00:04:37,479 --> 00:04:38,159
Meiqi.

105
00:04:38,560 --> 00:04:39,760
I saw your mom just now.

106
00:04:40,560 --> 00:04:42,520
She's over there talking to Mingzhu.

107
00:04:43,680 --> 00:04:44,799
Thanks, I got it.

108
00:04:47,220 --> 00:04:48,120
Let me put it this way.

109
00:04:48,120 --> 00:04:48,919
I came here today

110
00:04:48,919 --> 00:04:50,719
because I want to officially invite you

111
00:04:50,719 --> 00:04:52,320
to join me and Meiqi.

112
00:04:52,320 --> 00:04:55,399
The three of us together,
bringing the factory back to life.

113
00:04:58,599 --> 00:05:00,399
This is really sudden.

114
00:05:01,359 --> 00:05:02,839
I need some time to think about it.

115
00:05:02,839 --> 00:05:04,239
Trust me, Mingzhu.

116
00:05:04,240 --> 00:05:05,919
As long as
we get the factory running again,

117
00:05:05,919 --> 00:05:07,919
all the money you put in at the start

118
00:05:08,200 --> 00:05:09,120
will be worth it.

119
00:05:09,839 --> 00:05:11,039
We can afford to lose.

120
00:05:11,839 --> 00:05:13,320
I can't afford to lose anymore.

121
00:05:13,640 --> 00:05:14,239
Mom.

122
00:05:15,320 --> 00:05:16,080
Meiqi.

123
00:05:16,479 --> 00:05:17,479
What brings you here?

124
00:05:17,960 --> 00:05:20,159
I made some food.

125
00:05:20,159 --> 00:05:21,880
I brought it for you and Mingzhu.

126
00:05:22,399 --> 00:05:23,680
You can join her.

127
00:05:24,239 --> 00:05:24,799
Okay.

128
00:05:25,080 --> 00:05:25,640
Alright.

129
00:05:25,640 --> 00:05:26,799
Go on, go get back to work.

130
00:05:26,960 --> 00:05:28,159
Okay, we're heading out.

131
00:05:28,560 --> 00:05:29,719
Go, go, go.

132
00:05:31,159 --> 00:05:32,000
What did Mom say?

133
00:05:32,880 --> 00:05:33,640
Mingzhu.

134
00:05:37,599 --> 00:05:38,760
Go eat. Go on.

135
00:06:04,440 --> 00:06:05,599
Making me wait again?

136
00:06:06,520 --> 00:06:08,760
My little Mingzhu is upset now.

137
00:06:08,960 --> 00:06:10,479
I'll buy you a drink later, okay?

138
00:06:15,479 --> 00:06:16,239
Tell me why

139
00:06:16,239 --> 00:06:18,520
I always have to
be the one making choices.

140
00:06:19,279 --> 00:06:21,359
I already handled everything.

141
00:06:21,880 --> 00:06:23,520
But no one ever asks what I think.

142
00:06:23,799 --> 00:06:25,799
No one ever asks
if I even want to do it.

143
00:06:26,599 --> 00:06:27,960
I care. I really care.

144
00:06:27,960 --> 00:06:30,039
Then tell me this,
do you want to do it or not?

145
00:06:31,760 --> 00:06:32,320
See?

146
00:06:32,680 --> 00:06:33,950
I asked, and you still won't say.

147
00:06:34,640 --> 00:06:35,919
If I say it out loud,

148
00:06:36,359 --> 00:06:37,839
it makes things harder for everyone.

149
00:06:38,839 --> 00:06:39,520
True.

150
00:06:40,159 --> 00:06:41,520
You've always been the one

151
00:06:41,520 --> 00:06:42,440
who swallows it.

152
00:06:43,680 --> 00:06:44,880
For everything else, fine,

153
00:06:44,880 --> 00:06:46,330
I don't have any selfish intentions.

154
00:06:46,760 --> 00:06:48,200
But the restaurant

155
00:06:48,200 --> 00:06:50,080
is not my own selfish wish.

156
00:06:50,479 --> 00:06:51,120
Think about it.

157
00:06:51,239 --> 00:06:53,039
Meiqi and Jianqi's mom are jobless.

158
00:06:53,039 --> 00:06:54,440
How were they supposed to live?

159
00:06:54,960 --> 00:06:56,239
And look where we ended up.

160
00:06:58,239 --> 00:07:00,440
I just wanted a simple life,

161
00:07:00,440 --> 00:07:01,799
to get through this rough patch.

162
00:07:02,320 --> 00:07:03,479
I never wanted to be

163
00:07:03,479 --> 00:07:04,799
some hero saving everyone

164
00:07:04,799 --> 00:07:06,000
or the protagonist.

165
00:07:06,320 --> 00:07:08,839
I just want to hold on
to whatever small happiness I can.

166
00:07:09,279 --> 00:07:11,440
Why does it never go the way I hoped?

167
00:07:13,120 --> 00:07:14,960
I honestly used up so much strength

168
00:07:14,960 --> 00:07:16,159
just to make it this far.

169
00:07:22,320 --> 00:07:23,359
Listen to me.

170
00:07:24,279 --> 00:07:25,960
You've already done more than enough.

171
00:07:26,440 --> 00:07:27,000
Really.

172
00:07:27,359 --> 00:07:29,599
You've been amazing since we were kids.

173
00:07:30,760 --> 00:07:32,520
You just think
about everyone else too much.

174
00:07:33,399 --> 00:07:36,159
With this, stop worrying
about what other people think

175
00:07:36,159 --> 00:07:37,080
or their opinions.

176
00:07:37,479 --> 00:07:38,320
Just ask yourself

177
00:07:38,320 --> 00:07:39,200
if you want to do it.

178
00:07:41,490 --> 00:07:42,159
Think about it.

179
00:07:57,440 --> 00:07:59,399
I'm guessing you want
an iced Coke right now.

180
00:08:01,640 --> 00:08:03,120
Can pregnant women drink iced Coke?

181
00:08:03,239 --> 00:08:04,919
Of course you can. Why not?

182
00:08:05,279 --> 00:08:06,080
I'm the expert.

183
00:08:06,080 --> 00:08:07,479
If I say you can, you can.

184
00:08:07,479 --> 00:08:08,839
What, are you carrying a demon

185
00:08:08,839 --> 00:08:10,260
that won't even
let you have a Coke?

186
00:08:12,279 --> 00:08:13,279
So many of my boundaries

187
00:08:13,279 --> 00:08:14,680
get broken because of you.

188
00:08:15,399 --> 00:08:16,520
Come on, don't exaggerate.

189
00:08:16,520 --> 00:08:17,560
It's just a Coke.

190
00:08:23,520 --> 00:08:24,000
So good.

191
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:24,599
So good!

192
00:08:39,160 --> 00:08:42,359
Don't buy more eggs
if the ones at home aren't finished.

193
00:08:42,680 --> 00:08:43,759
I didn't buy them.

194
00:08:43,759 --> 00:08:45,719
Zhang Hao bought them.
They were on sale.

195
00:08:46,920 --> 00:08:48,519
He just loves buying things on sale.

196
00:08:49,080 --> 00:08:50,479
I'm not coming home for lunch.

197
00:08:51,400 --> 00:08:52,560
Where are you going?

198
00:08:52,719 --> 00:08:53,359
Got stuff to do.

199
00:08:54,759 --> 00:08:57,320
Always busy running around
doing who-knows-what.

200
00:08:57,519 --> 00:08:58,160
Seriously.

201
00:09:02,119 --> 00:09:02,719
Shen.

202
00:09:03,119 --> 00:09:04,200
I'm heading out for a bit.

203
00:09:04,200 --> 00:09:04,879
Where you going?

204
00:09:05,119 --> 00:09:05,999
I'll be right back.

205
00:09:07,550 --> 00:09:09,239
Bring back some cilantro if you see any.

206
00:09:15,960 --> 00:09:16,920
- Grocery run.
- Hello.

207
00:09:16,920 --> 00:09:17,519
Heading out.

208
00:09:19,839 --> 00:09:20,639
Yes, indeed.

209
00:09:21,280 --> 00:09:21,800
Yeah.

210
00:09:22,599 --> 00:09:24,440
Xu, where are you off to?

211
00:09:28,400 --> 00:09:29,359
Going to see someone.

212
00:09:35,040 --> 00:09:35,680
Xiu'e.

213
00:09:35,879 --> 00:09:36,479
Heading out?

214
00:09:46,239 --> 00:09:47,080
Cleaning veggies?

215
00:09:49,560 --> 00:09:50,479
Just got back.

216
00:09:50,479 --> 00:09:51,759
Yeah, the fruit is cheap today.

217
00:09:51,759 --> 00:09:52,639
Want one?

218
00:09:52,639 --> 00:09:53,200
I'm good.

219
00:09:53,250 --> 00:09:54,239
Your veggies look fresh.

220
00:09:54,239 --> 00:09:54,839
Yep.

221
00:09:54,839 --> 00:09:56,080
The soybeans are in season.

222
00:09:56,080 --> 00:09:57,550
- Rare to see you grocery shopping.
- True enough.

223
00:09:58,239 --> 00:09:58,879
Miss.

224
00:09:58,879 --> 00:10:00,239
I'm trying to find someone.

225
00:10:00,359 --> 00:10:03,119
Her surname is Yu. Yu Jingxiang.

226
00:10:37,800 --> 00:10:38,800
I'm sorry.

227
00:10:39,160 --> 00:10:40,359
Please forgive me.

228
00:10:44,359 --> 00:10:45,040
Xiu'e.

229
00:10:48,759 --> 00:10:49,359
You...

230
00:10:51,239 --> 00:10:53,639
What are you doing here?

231
00:11:00,040 --> 00:11:00,800
Mr. Shen.

232
00:11:03,999 --> 00:11:05,680
Your mom hasn't changed one bit.

233
00:11:07,280 --> 00:11:07,879
Right.

234
00:11:17,800 --> 00:11:19,960
You're keeping the flowers really well.

235
00:11:20,560 --> 00:11:21,680
Yeah. I grew them.

236
00:11:26,879 --> 00:11:27,759
So, well...

237
00:11:34,440 --> 00:11:36,400
I know that girl came by

238
00:11:36,960 --> 00:11:38,800
to apologize to you for me.

239
00:11:39,519 --> 00:11:40,519
And Shen keeps saying

240
00:11:40,519 --> 00:11:42,119
I didn't handle the situation right.

241
00:11:42,119 --> 00:11:42,680
I just...

242
00:11:45,920 --> 00:11:47,879
Yes, the note existed.

243
00:11:52,239 --> 00:11:54,180
This was something I…

244
00:11:54,190 --> 00:11:55,239
I should've told you myself

245
00:11:55,239 --> 00:11:56,839
instead of letting Mingzhu apologize for me.

246
00:11:56,839 --> 00:11:57,440
Wait.

247
00:11:57,810 --> 00:11:59,359
Saying it out loud makes me feel better.

248
00:11:59,359 --> 00:12:00,060
Really, it does.

249
00:12:00,070 --> 00:12:01,560
I've had it bottled up for years.

250
00:12:01,560 --> 00:12:02,599
I felt terrible too.

251
00:12:03,359 --> 00:12:03,999
Xiu'e.

252
00:12:04,999 --> 00:12:08,160
Honestly, you raised Mingzhu
when she was a tiny little girl.

253
00:12:09,080 --> 00:12:10,359
You've raised her well.

254
00:12:11,040 --> 00:12:12,280
All your kindness...

255
00:12:12,280 --> 00:12:12,839
I've...

256
00:12:13,920 --> 00:12:15,519
I've felt them.

257
00:12:16,440 --> 00:12:18,879
Really. I mean that.

258
00:12:19,280 --> 00:12:20,040
Mr. Shen.

259
00:12:20,920 --> 00:12:23,080
That day was totally my fault.

260
00:12:23,519 --> 00:12:24,879
It was supposed to be wonderful,

261
00:12:25,340 --> 00:12:26,680
and I somehow managed to ruin it.

262
00:12:26,680 --> 00:12:28,040
I made everyone awkward.

263
00:12:31,800 --> 00:12:32,879
It's because of this.

264
00:12:33,560 --> 00:12:35,280
I drank too much that day.

265
00:12:35,479 --> 00:12:37,479
And then I pulled that thing out.

266
00:12:37,920 --> 00:12:38,920
I promise you,

267
00:12:39,359 --> 00:12:40,200
from now on,

268
00:12:40,479 --> 00:12:42,839
it has nothing to do with us.

269
00:12:43,479 --> 00:12:44,160
It's void.

270
00:12:46,040 --> 00:12:47,519
How could it not matter?

271
00:12:48,080 --> 00:12:48,999
You don't believe me?

272
00:12:56,080 --> 00:12:56,920
What are you doing?

273
00:12:57,239 --> 00:12:58,800
Burning it. Turning the page.

274
00:13:00,119 --> 00:13:01,320
Hold on, you can't...

275
00:13:01,320 --> 00:13:02,280
I'm getting rid of it.

276
00:13:02,400 --> 00:13:03,320
This has to go away.

277
00:13:08,200 --> 00:13:09,080
See?

278
00:13:09,719 --> 00:13:10,320
Look.

279
00:13:14,359 --> 00:13:15,320
Where's the note?

280
00:13:17,479 --> 00:13:18,119
It's gone.

281
00:13:18,800 --> 00:13:21,599
That note never existed
in this world anymore.

282
00:13:22,400 --> 00:13:24,200
Let's not bring it up again. It's done.

283
00:13:24,200 --> 00:13:26,400
Honestly, it should've been
over a long time ago.

284
00:13:26,400 --> 00:13:27,479
I'm just too stubborn,

285
00:13:27,479 --> 00:13:28,080
you know?

286
00:13:28,080 --> 00:13:29,479
But when I think about it,

287
00:13:29,920 --> 00:13:31,759
it's great for a kid to have two moms.

288
00:13:31,759 --> 00:13:32,280
It is.

289
00:13:32,599 --> 00:13:34,759
If one of us ever gets sick,

290
00:13:34,759 --> 00:13:36,680
or we have to
go visit relatives somewhere,

291
00:13:36,680 --> 00:13:38,060
there's someone there to help out.

292
00:13:38,320 --> 00:13:38,879
Exactly.

293
00:13:39,440 --> 00:13:40,519
Mingzhu told me

294
00:13:40,519 --> 00:13:42,320
that she's already put this behind her.

295
00:13:42,920 --> 00:13:43,280
Right.

296
00:13:43,280 --> 00:13:44,560
So don't keep holding it inside.

297
00:13:44,560 --> 00:13:46,560
We'll leave it in the past.

298
00:13:46,680 --> 00:13:47,359
Right?

299
00:13:47,440 --> 00:13:47,960
Right.

300
00:13:48,080 --> 00:13:48,879
From now on,

301
00:13:49,639 --> 00:13:52,639
we're one family.

302
00:13:52,639 --> 00:13:53,920
But let me tell you,

303
00:13:55,200 --> 00:13:56,639
don't celebrate just yet.

304
00:13:56,719 --> 00:13:58,160
You're not allowed to favor your son.

305
00:13:58,160 --> 00:13:58,560
Okay.

306
00:13:58,560 --> 00:14:00,359
If you mistreat our Mingzhu,

307
00:14:00,359 --> 00:14:01,879
I won't be as polite next time.

308
00:14:02,519 --> 00:14:03,879
Okay, okay.

309
00:14:03,879 --> 00:14:04,879
Don't worry.

310
00:14:06,320 --> 00:14:07,639
Alright, I should go.

311
00:14:07,879 --> 00:14:08,999
I have work at the shop.

312
00:14:08,999 --> 00:14:09,999
I'll head out.

313
00:14:10,200 --> 00:14:10,719
Okay.

314
00:14:10,719 --> 00:14:12,239
Find some time to drop by.

315
00:14:12,239 --> 00:14:12,759
Okay.

316
00:14:12,759 --> 00:14:13,280
Alright then.

317
00:14:13,519 --> 00:14:14,160
I'm off.

318
00:14:14,160 --> 00:14:16,120
- I can see myself out.
-  I'm not keeping you.

319
00:14:30,359 --> 00:14:31,040
Mom.

320
00:14:32,280 --> 00:14:33,119
Mom.

321
00:14:34,999 --> 00:14:36,080
It all worked out.

322
00:14:43,759 --> 00:14:45,200
That's a lot of silk.

323
00:14:46,839 --> 00:14:48,040
At this year's price,

324
00:14:48,040 --> 00:14:49,479
how much would this be worth?

325
00:14:50,599 --> 00:14:51,999
At least three million.

326
00:14:52,479 --> 00:14:53,599
Three million?

327
00:14:53,599 --> 00:14:54,440
Three million.

328
00:14:54,440 --> 00:14:56,560
It's the soft gold of fabrics.

329
00:14:57,320 --> 00:14:58,680
The price must've multiplied

330
00:14:58,999 --> 00:14:59,999
since I was a kid.

331
00:15:00,879 --> 00:15:01,920
More than a few.

332
00:15:03,080 --> 00:15:03,800
Mingzhu,

333
00:15:04,519 --> 00:15:05,320
look at this.

334
00:15:05,759 --> 00:15:06,839
When Jianqi was little,

335
00:15:06,839 --> 00:15:09,119
he used to run around here playing.

336
00:15:09,119 --> 00:15:10,160
He was such a handful.

337
00:15:10,839 --> 00:15:12,160
But he had his good moments too.

338
00:15:12,800 --> 00:15:14,280
When I had Meiqi,

339
00:15:14,280 --> 00:15:16,359
he even helped me rock her to sleep.

340
00:15:17,479 --> 00:15:18,759
I don't even remember that.

341
00:15:18,999 --> 00:15:19,800
You were tiny.

342
00:15:19,800 --> 00:15:21,200
How would you remember?

343
00:15:22,080 --> 00:15:24,360
You were way more
of a troublemaker than your brother,

344
00:15:24,440 --> 00:15:25,719
but also smarter.

345
00:15:25,960 --> 00:15:26,920
Listen.

346
00:15:27,060 --> 00:15:28,359
Just from what's woven on this,

347
00:15:28,359 --> 00:15:29,560
she can tell with a touch

348
00:15:29,560 --> 00:15:31,320
what the fabric is like.

349
00:15:31,999 --> 00:15:33,759
And she's great at numbers.

350
00:15:33,960 --> 00:15:36,239
She was faster than a calculator.

351
00:15:36,599 --> 00:15:38,440
In that, she's better than Jianqi.

352
00:15:47,599 --> 00:15:48,160
Meiqi.

353
00:15:50,160 --> 00:15:51,440
This is meant to be.

354
00:15:52,519 --> 00:15:54,239
You should go after what you want to do.

355
00:15:55,960 --> 00:15:56,560
Mingzhu...

356
00:15:57,479 --> 00:15:59,160
Knowing what you want

357
00:15:59,839 --> 00:16:01,359
is how you figure out where to go next.

358
00:16:03,320 --> 00:16:04,119
What about you?

359
00:16:06,719 --> 00:16:07,599
I will too.

360
00:16:24,960 --> 00:16:25,839
Meiqi.

361
00:16:26,239 --> 00:16:27,800
Mingzhu, come quick, come look.

362
00:16:28,560 --> 00:16:30,200
It's still here.

363
00:16:32,479 --> 00:16:33,400
What is this?

364
00:16:35,639 --> 00:16:37,759
These are all Jianqi's treasures.

365
00:16:37,759 --> 00:16:38,680
See?

366
00:16:38,680 --> 00:16:39,680
His treasures.

367
00:16:40,960 --> 00:16:42,040
His marbles.

368
00:16:42,160 --> 00:16:42,800
And this.

369
00:16:43,519 --> 00:16:46,519
I was too busy when he was little.

370
00:16:47,400 --> 00:16:48,759
Jianqi kept pestering me

371
00:16:48,759 --> 00:16:49,839
to play with him.

372
00:16:50,160 --> 00:16:52,359
So I threaded all the thimbles together,

373
00:16:52,359 --> 00:16:53,200
tied them in knots,

374
00:16:53,200 --> 00:16:54,080
and I told him

375
00:16:54,680 --> 00:16:55,680
to open them up.

376
00:16:56,200 --> 00:16:57,680
I told him I'd play with him

377
00:16:57,680 --> 00:16:59,239
if he could untie the knots.

378
00:17:05,270 --> 00:17:06,239
The knots were intact.

379
00:17:08,559 --> 00:17:09,920
It's still here.

380
00:17:12,559 --> 00:17:13,239
Mom.

381
00:17:13,999 --> 00:17:15,400
Can I take a look?

382
00:17:23,440 --> 00:17:24,120
Meiqi.

383
00:17:35,120 --> 00:17:35,719
Baby.

384
00:17:37,079 --> 00:17:38,760
You will have to
untie them for your dad.

385
00:17:42,759 --> 00:17:44,239
You're quick

386
00:17:44,239 --> 00:17:45,120
at everything,

387
00:17:45,120 --> 00:17:46,640
except homework.

388
00:17:47,680 --> 00:17:49,239
Mom, is dinner ready?

389
00:17:49,239 --> 00:17:50,880
Dad should be telling me to eat by now.

390
00:17:50,880 --> 00:17:51,479
Jiao.

391
00:17:51,479 --> 00:17:53,120
Dinner is ready!

392
00:17:53,279 --> 00:17:54,400
Seriously, you two?

393
00:17:55,200 --> 00:17:56,479
Hurry up and eat.

394
00:17:56,999 --> 00:17:59,110
Sitting there any longer
won't get her the answers.

395
00:17:59,640 --> 00:18:00,440
Mom is here.

396
00:18:01,239 --> 00:18:02,079
Hello, Grandma.

397
00:18:02,400 --> 00:18:03,440
Mom, have you eaten?

398
00:18:03,920 --> 00:18:04,759
I haven't.

399
00:18:05,759 --> 00:18:06,640
Mom, join us.

400
00:18:06,640 --> 00:18:07,440
Let me through.

401
00:18:07,440 --> 00:18:08,400
I need to get through.

402
00:18:09,200 --> 00:18:09,840
Come on.

403
00:18:10,840 --> 00:18:11,680
Perfect timing.

404
00:18:11,680 --> 00:18:12,410
Let me carry that.

405
00:18:12,799 --> 00:18:13,880
I bought some groceries.

406
00:18:13,880 --> 00:18:14,759
Take a seat.

407
00:18:16,840 --> 00:18:17,640
I'll do it myself.

408
00:18:17,640 --> 00:18:18,640
- It's alright.
- Sit.

409
00:18:18,640 --> 00:18:19,960
I'll wash my hands first.

410
00:18:20,559 --> 00:18:21,440
Just leave them here.

411
00:18:33,200 --> 00:18:34,559
I made a few dishes.

412
00:18:35,600 --> 00:18:36,200
Let's eat.

413
00:18:37,500 --> 00:18:38,759
About the baby's extra finger...

414
00:18:40,160 --> 00:18:42,440
Have you looked into it more?

415
00:18:48,519 --> 00:18:49,160
Mom.

416
00:18:49,880 --> 00:18:50,600
Let's eat first.

417
00:18:53,239 --> 00:18:54,759
You left in a hurry that day,

418
00:18:54,759 --> 00:18:56,239
I didn't finish talking.

419
00:18:56,239 --> 00:18:58,120
The baby can have surgery
at three months old.

420
00:19:00,479 --> 00:19:01,559
So surgery is possible.

421
00:19:02,039 --> 00:19:04,120
Which means it can be treated.

422
00:19:05,319 --> 00:19:06,920
But surgery requires general anesthesia.

423
00:19:07,400 --> 00:19:08,519
There's still risk.

424
00:19:08,840 --> 00:19:09,960
Zhixia, I know.

425
00:19:10,400 --> 00:19:13,239
I know it's scary, and it's unfair.

426
00:19:13,799 --> 00:19:16,079
But I can't make the decision for you.

427
00:19:17,960 --> 00:19:18,719
Don't worry.

428
00:19:18,719 --> 00:19:20,719
The money from
the demolition of my old house

429
00:19:20,719 --> 00:19:23,160
will be used for the baby's treatment.

430
00:19:27,319 --> 00:19:27,920
Mom…

431
00:19:29,340 --> 00:19:30,960
Don't you want to
know the baby's gender?

432
00:19:31,400 --> 00:19:32,719
A boy or a girl, it's the same.

433
00:19:34,130 --> 00:19:35,479
They're all flowers of the nation.

434
00:19:38,160 --> 00:19:39,880
Why did you ask me to check before?

435
00:19:41,920 --> 00:19:43,799
In my heart…

436
00:19:45,440 --> 00:19:45,999
I just…

437
00:19:47,160 --> 00:19:48,759
I was asking too much of you.

438
00:19:48,759 --> 00:19:49,759
Let me translate that.

439
00:19:49,759 --> 00:19:50,559
I understood.

440
00:19:52,559 --> 00:19:54,960
Since I already had a granddaughter,

441
00:19:54,960 --> 00:19:57,319
I thought it might be nice
to have a grandson, too.

442
00:19:57,319 --> 00:19:58,479
That's all it was.

443
00:19:59,319 --> 00:19:59,960
Right?

444
00:20:00,039 --> 00:20:01,960
But now, Zhixia...

445
00:20:02,160 --> 00:20:02,719
I...

446
00:20:02,719 --> 00:20:04,920
As long as the baby's whole and healthy,

447
00:20:04,920 --> 00:20:06,960
that alone makes us lucky.

448
00:20:10,039 --> 00:20:10,719
Grandma.

449
00:20:16,160 --> 00:20:17,519
Which half tastes better?

450
00:20:26,799 --> 00:20:27,519
They're both good.

451
00:20:27,799 --> 00:20:30,160
Yes, because they're from the same bun.

452
00:20:30,440 --> 00:20:31,719
They taste just as good.

453
00:20:32,039 --> 00:20:33,670
Doesn't matter if it's a boy or a girl,

454
00:20:33,719 --> 00:20:35,479
or five fingers or six.

455
00:20:35,479 --> 00:20:36,239
No need to worry.

456
00:20:36,719 --> 00:20:37,319
Because we are

457
00:20:37,319 --> 00:20:39,519
Mom and Dad's favorite babies.

458
00:20:41,200 --> 00:20:42,440
Listen to her.

459
00:20:42,440 --> 00:20:43,719
Jiao's got real talent.

460
00:20:44,239 --> 00:20:44,920
Why can't you do

461
00:20:44,920 --> 00:20:46,039
just as well with essays?

462
00:20:46,039 --> 00:20:46,559
You know that?

463
00:20:46,559 --> 00:20:47,559
You're so annoying.

464
00:20:47,559 --> 00:20:49,479
She said it so well.
What's your problem?

465
00:20:54,479 --> 00:20:55,079
Mom…

466
00:20:57,160 --> 00:20:59,680
I had a bad attitude toward you before.

467
00:20:59,680 --> 00:21:00,640
Please don't be mad.

468
00:21:00,640 --> 00:21:01,239
No.

469
00:21:02,640 --> 00:21:04,519
I thought it was my fault.

470
00:21:05,319 --> 00:21:06,600
So first,

471
00:21:08,120 --> 00:21:10,039
I want to reflect on my mistakes.

472
00:21:10,039 --> 00:21:11,600
Mom, um…

473
00:21:13,680 --> 00:21:15,050
Let me just criticize myself first.

474
00:21:18,440 --> 00:21:19,239
I was...

475
00:21:21,079 --> 00:21:23,200
I was way too picky about Zhang Hao.

476
00:21:23,660 --> 00:21:25,519
I kept pushing him
to get a director position.

477
00:21:26,079 --> 00:21:27,519
I was just passing on my anxiety.

478
00:21:27,999 --> 00:21:30,680
I was scared he'd fall behind his peers.

479
00:21:33,960 --> 00:21:35,120
But later I calmed down.

480
00:21:36,360 --> 00:21:38,079
I'm a writer myself.

481
00:21:38,160 --> 00:21:39,999
How did I let myself get pushed

482
00:21:41,640 --> 00:21:43,079
into this mental trap?

483
00:21:45,200 --> 00:21:46,559
It's not like I can't earn money.

484
00:21:46,960 --> 00:21:49,559
Zhang Hao's job allows him
to better care for his family.

485
00:21:49,880 --> 00:21:50,960
That's why this home

486
00:21:51,719 --> 00:21:52,920
is so stable.

487
00:21:53,479 --> 00:21:54,319
So happy.

488
00:21:57,200 --> 00:21:58,840
People spend their whole lives

489
00:21:59,360 --> 00:22:01,079
looking for their own strength.

490
00:22:02,920 --> 00:22:04,960
Not losing your joy and confidence

491
00:22:04,960 --> 00:22:06,239
is the greatest success.

492
00:22:07,799 --> 00:22:09,559
Life is yours to live.

493
00:22:10,120 --> 00:22:11,559
Other people, other things,

494
00:22:12,400 --> 00:22:13,719
are just here to help.

495
00:22:14,400 --> 00:22:15,160
If we have them,

496
00:22:16,600 --> 00:22:17,759
everyone's happy.

497
00:22:18,200 --> 00:22:18,840
If not,

498
00:22:19,079 --> 00:22:21,200
we should take it in stride.

499
00:22:21,960 --> 00:22:22,600
Right?

500
00:22:23,640 --> 00:22:24,920
So Hao,

501
00:22:25,559 --> 00:22:27,999
live according to your own heart.

502
00:22:28,400 --> 00:22:29,079
As for me,

503
00:22:29,999 --> 00:22:33,400
I need to find my own rhythm again.

504
00:22:37,840 --> 00:22:39,120
Is this still my wife?

505
00:22:41,400 --> 00:22:41,960
Mom?

506
00:22:42,999 --> 00:22:44,360
Is this still my mom?

507
00:22:44,759 --> 00:22:46,160
Is this still my daughter?

508
00:22:46,960 --> 00:22:47,999
You guys are...

509
00:22:48,960 --> 00:22:50,960
You're so familiar,
yet also feel like a stranger.

510
00:22:50,960 --> 00:22:52,700
Come on,
shouldn't you have grown up a bit?

511
00:22:54,319 --> 00:22:55,799
I've grown plenty.

512
00:23:01,799 --> 00:23:02,360
Eat up.

513
00:23:02,840 --> 00:23:03,519
Eat up.

514
00:23:03,519 --> 00:23:04,999
All this was made with hard work.

515
00:23:06,719 --> 00:23:08,200
Eat. Have the bun.

516
00:23:08,200 --> 00:23:09,200
Which one's better?

517
00:23:10,079 --> 00:23:10,880
Which one's better?

518
00:23:11,840 --> 00:23:13,640
It's sticking to my teeth.

519
00:23:19,840 --> 00:23:20,400
Hello.

520
00:23:20,719 --> 00:23:21,999
Have you made a decision?

521
00:23:23,519 --> 00:23:24,079
Hello.

522
00:23:24,079 --> 00:23:25,440
I'm Zhou Sha,

523
00:23:25,440 --> 00:23:26,559
COO of Manting Hotel Group.

524
00:23:27,519 --> 00:23:28,200
Hello.

525
00:23:28,920 --> 00:23:29,960
Don't you remember me?

526
00:23:30,039 --> 00:23:31,079
Of course I remember.

527
00:23:31,079 --> 00:23:32,960
Weren't you here
to book an engagement banquet?

528
00:23:33,680 --> 00:23:34,600
I'm really sorry.

529
00:23:34,600 --> 00:23:35,600
We lied to you last time.

530
00:23:35,600 --> 00:23:38,610
We were actually representing the group
to do a detailed review

531
00:23:38,610 --> 00:23:40,160
of the catering operations you manage.

532
00:23:40,160 --> 00:23:41,960
I've brought my team

533
00:23:41,960 --> 00:23:43,999
to talk with you about future plans.

534
00:23:45,200 --> 00:23:46,920
Okay, let's sit down and talk.

535
00:23:46,920 --> 00:23:47,360
Okay.

536
00:23:49,200 --> 00:23:50,079
Here, have some water.

537
00:23:50,640 --> 00:23:51,120
Thanks.

538
00:23:52,799 --> 00:23:53,279
Here.

539
00:23:55,319 --> 00:23:57,039
You want to talk partnership?

540
00:23:57,239 --> 00:23:57,880
That's right.

541
00:23:58,600 --> 00:24:00,039
Manting has already begun

542
00:24:00,039 --> 00:24:01,920
detailed talks with Nanxi Hotel

543
00:24:01,920 --> 00:24:03,160
about other businesses.

544
00:24:03,160 --> 00:24:04,559
Now we just need your part.

545
00:24:05,840 --> 00:24:08,319
We're looking to acquire
Nanxi's F&B division.

546
00:24:09,279 --> 00:24:09,880
Acquire?

547
00:24:10,559 --> 00:24:11,120
Yes.

548
00:24:13,960 --> 00:24:15,279
Rather than "acquire,"

549
00:24:15,410 --> 00:24:16,600
think of it as a partnership.

550
00:24:17,279 --> 00:24:17,960
Miss Shen,

551
00:24:17,960 --> 00:24:19,400
may I walk you through

552
00:24:19,400 --> 00:24:20,519
our plans for Nanxi Hotel

553
00:24:20,519 --> 00:24:22,319
after it folds

554
00:24:22,319 --> 00:24:23,039
into Manting?

555
00:24:24,519 --> 00:24:25,400
Here's the proposal.

556
00:24:28,680 --> 00:24:30,559
The Old Town is surrounded
by heritage streets.

557
00:24:30,880 --> 00:24:32,999
Manting plans
to respect the local style,

558
00:24:33,200 --> 00:24:35,360
while building on
our high-end custom standards,

559
00:24:35,360 --> 00:24:37,319
and creating for our guests

560
00:24:37,319 --> 00:24:39,440
a unique immersive travel experience.

561
00:24:39,440 --> 00:24:41,479
It's all within
2 kilometers of the hotel,

562
00:24:41,479 --> 00:24:43,920
both inside
and outside the hotel grounds.

563
00:24:44,759 --> 00:24:46,120
So our restaurant here

564
00:24:46,120 --> 00:24:48,120
is part of your bigger plan?

565
00:24:48,559 --> 00:24:49,160
Exactly.

566
00:24:49,440 --> 00:24:51,840
Our group will
invest heavily to rebuild it.

567
00:24:53,440 --> 00:24:55,079
And don't worry about the cost.

568
00:24:55,079 --> 00:24:56,559
Everything you've put in before

569
00:24:56,559 --> 00:24:57,759
will be fully covered.

570
00:24:58,239 --> 00:24:59,120
You'll only get more.

571
00:25:01,239 --> 00:25:03,410
Honestly, the last time we talked,

572
00:25:03,410 --> 00:25:05,279
and when you walked me
through your proposal,

573
00:25:05,279 --> 00:25:06,999
I could tell you're a great

574
00:25:06,999 --> 00:25:07,759
content creator.

575
00:25:07,880 --> 00:25:09,799
You revived a place that was going under

576
00:25:09,799 --> 00:25:10,920
and rebuilt it from scratch.

577
00:25:11,039 --> 00:25:12,160
Your way of doing things

578
00:25:12,160 --> 00:25:14,279
fits perfectly with Manting's style.

579
00:25:15,200 --> 00:25:16,079
You flatter me.

580
00:25:16,600 --> 00:25:17,640
I'm not being polite.

581
00:25:18,239 --> 00:25:18,960
Which is why,

582
00:25:19,360 --> 00:25:21,400
on behalf of the group,

583
00:25:21,559 --> 00:25:23,279
I sincerely invite you to join us.

584
00:25:23,360 --> 00:25:24,999
Once the new hotel is completed,

585
00:25:24,999 --> 00:25:26,239
our operations team

586
00:25:26,239 --> 00:25:27,799
will need talents like you.

587
00:25:28,400 --> 00:25:30,120
After you have your baby,

588
00:25:30,120 --> 00:25:32,160
you can come back to the new Nanxi Hotel

589
00:25:32,160 --> 00:25:33,039
and continue working.

590
00:25:33,360 --> 00:25:35,960
During your pregnancy
and after delivery,

591
00:25:36,160 --> 00:25:37,559
you'll enjoy every single

592
00:25:37,559 --> 00:25:40,360
group benefit
and welfare package we offer.

593
00:25:42,200 --> 00:25:43,360
Are you serious?

594
00:25:43,600 --> 00:25:44,360
Of course.

595
00:25:44,920 --> 00:25:47,360
But it's fine, take your time to think it over.

596
00:25:47,719 --> 00:25:48,640
Once you decide,

597
00:25:48,999 --> 00:25:49,880
contact me anytime.

598
00:25:53,840 --> 00:25:54,479
Jianqi…

599
00:25:55,759 --> 00:25:57,680
Have you been by my side
this whole time?

600
00:25:58,239 --> 00:26:00,079
You never left, have you?

601
00:26:01,840 --> 00:26:03,319
Whenever I hit a bump,

602
00:26:04,239 --> 00:26:06,200
you quietly show up to help.

603
00:26:07,200 --> 00:26:08,759
This deal with Zhou Sha

604
00:26:09,440 --> 00:26:10,680
is basically

605
00:26:10,680 --> 00:26:12,120
a huge golden cheat code from you.

606
00:26:14,640 --> 00:26:15,200
Mingzhu.

607
00:26:15,880 --> 00:26:16,719
Dinner's ready.

608
00:26:17,120 --> 00:26:18,519
Okay, I'm coming.

609
00:26:18,719 --> 00:26:19,719
I'll wait downstairs.

610
00:26:23,120 --> 00:26:25,479
Did you send Minghui
to fetch me for dinner?

611
00:26:29,239 --> 00:26:29,840
Mom…

612
00:26:30,440 --> 00:26:31,880
I want to run something by you.

613
00:26:32,360 --> 00:26:32,960
What's up?

614
00:26:33,400 --> 00:26:35,160
Next week's Mid-Autumn Festival, right?

615
00:26:35,799 --> 00:26:37,840
I want to invite
the whole family for dinner.

616
00:26:38,400 --> 00:26:40,120
The whole family? Who exactly?

617
00:26:42,160 --> 00:26:43,600
Zhixia and her family.

618
00:26:44,559 --> 00:26:45,600
Okay, sure.

619
00:26:46,239 --> 00:26:47,799
Sounds great, no problem.

620
00:26:48,719 --> 00:26:50,120
I'll give them a call.

621
00:26:50,120 --> 00:26:51,440
Sure.

622
00:26:55,360 --> 00:26:56,200
Hello, Mingzhu?

623
00:26:56,559 --> 00:26:57,479
Hey, Zhixia.

624
00:26:58,200 --> 00:26:58,960
Busy?

625
00:26:59,719 --> 00:27:01,160
Busy unlocking cheat codes.

626
00:27:01,880 --> 00:27:03,600
Your family too?

627
00:27:04,239 --> 00:27:06,120
Isn't it about the baby's sixth finger?

628
00:27:06,719 --> 00:27:07,680
I'm thinking

629
00:27:07,799 --> 00:27:09,680
maybe there's an even better solution.

630
00:27:11,120 --> 00:27:12,999
Let me see who I can find for you.

631
00:27:14,719 --> 00:27:15,640
You see,

632
00:27:16,279 --> 00:27:17,960
next week's Mid-Autumn Festival, right?

633
00:27:18,519 --> 00:27:19,920
I want to invite your family

634
00:27:19,920 --> 00:27:21,239
over to ours for dinner.

635
00:27:21,999 --> 00:27:22,840
My family?

636
00:27:23,400 --> 00:27:24,440
You mean…

637
00:27:25,680 --> 00:27:26,279
Yeah.

638
00:27:27,200 --> 00:27:27,999
No problem.

639
00:27:28,680 --> 00:27:30,200
Madam Yu, Mr. Xu,

640
00:27:30,960 --> 00:27:32,239
and Mr. Xu Zhidong.

641
00:27:33,120 --> 00:27:33,680
Okay.

642
00:27:37,360 --> 00:27:37,960
Mom.

643
00:27:39,759 --> 00:27:43,640
Mingzhu said
we should all have dinner next week.

644
00:27:44,759 --> 00:27:46,079
And she specifically emphasized

645
00:27:46,600 --> 00:27:47,920
"the whole family".

646
00:27:51,200 --> 00:27:51,759
The whole…

647
00:27:53,400 --> 00:27:55,400
The whole family is
getting together to eat?

648
00:27:55,600 --> 00:27:56,600
That's great.

649
00:27:56,719 --> 00:27:58,719
Did she say what it's called?

650
00:27:59,200 --> 00:28:01,999
What's the name for it?

651
00:28:02,759 --> 00:28:03,600
The whole family…

652
00:28:04,039 --> 00:28:04,880
A family dinner.

653
00:28:05,440 --> 00:28:06,279
A reunion dinner?

654
00:28:08,079 --> 00:28:08,640
Great.

655
00:28:08,920 --> 00:28:10,680
And your brother?

656
00:28:10,690 --> 00:28:11,559
What about Zhidong?

657
00:28:11,559 --> 00:28:12,479
I'll notify him.

658
00:28:12,759 --> 00:28:13,640
Wonderful.

659
00:28:13,640 --> 00:28:14,600
Absolutely wonderful.

660
00:28:15,400 --> 00:28:16,039
So nice.

661
00:28:19,559 --> 00:28:20,440
Madam Yu.

662
00:28:21,960 --> 00:28:23,440
Could you check your phone?

663
00:28:30,680 --> 00:28:31,880
What did you send me?

664
00:28:34,680 --> 00:28:38,200
Mingzhu's WeChat contact card.

665
00:28:38,279 --> 00:28:39,640
I don't know how to do this…

666
00:28:41,440 --> 00:28:42,360
She said

667
00:28:42,519 --> 00:28:44,920
it'll be easier
for you two to stay in touch.

668
00:28:45,360 --> 00:28:45,840
Really?

669
00:28:45,840 --> 00:28:47,120
That's what she said?

670
00:28:50,759 --> 00:28:51,479
Added.

671
00:28:52,279 --> 00:28:53,239
Great!

672
00:28:53,880 --> 00:28:55,559
From now on,

673
00:28:56,559 --> 00:28:58,719
I can talk to our Zhilu whenever I want.

674
00:29:01,400 --> 00:29:02,559
And I can also

675
00:29:02,559 --> 00:29:05,079
see her Moments anytime I want.

676
00:29:06,400 --> 00:29:06,960
Well…

677
00:29:25,220 --> 00:29:27,239
(Home in Harmony,
Prosperity in All Things)

678
00:29:27,239 --> 00:29:28,079
That's...

679
00:29:28,079 --> 00:29:28,719
Minghui,

680
00:29:29,239 --> 00:29:31,120
lower that light a bit.

681
00:29:31,120 --> 00:29:31,759
- Okay.
- Good.

682
00:29:32,920 --> 00:29:34,559
Didn't expect our little restaurant

683
00:29:34,559 --> 00:29:36,079
to look this nice.

684
00:29:36,460 --> 00:29:37,200
It's already nice.

685
00:29:37,200 --> 00:29:39,440
It's the holidays.
We need to add some vibe, Mom.

686
00:29:39,719 --> 00:29:40,840
And look who did it.

687
00:29:41,160 --> 00:29:43,120
Minghui is getting
more capable by the day.

688
00:29:43,120 --> 00:29:44,360
Not too shabby, Hui.

689
00:29:44,360 --> 00:29:45,799
Mom, don't praise him.

690
00:29:46,160 --> 00:29:47,700
One compliment and he gets carried away.

691
00:29:48,519 --> 00:29:49,079
Mingzhu,

692
00:29:49,079 --> 00:29:51,239
I think Minghui has leveled up lately.

693
00:29:51,440 --> 00:29:53,319
Just compared to me,
he's still a bit behind.

694
00:29:53,319 --> 00:29:54,279
Yeah, sure.

695
00:29:54,279 --> 00:29:55,840
Yes, you're the best.

696
00:29:56,120 --> 00:29:56,719
I'll toss

697
00:29:56,719 --> 00:29:58,400
extra chili in your dish later for that.

698
00:29:58,400 --> 00:30:00,160
Let's see if you've grown
in spice tolerance too.

699
00:30:00,160 --> 00:30:01,840
You'd better do it.

700
00:30:02,319 --> 00:30:02,920
I'm out.

701
00:30:05,680 --> 00:30:06,640
Is that too much?

702
00:30:06,920 --> 00:30:07,719
Xiu'e.

703
00:30:08,079 --> 00:30:09,039
- Xiu'e.
- Mr. Shen!

704
00:30:09,200 --> 00:30:10,400
Mr. Shen!

705
00:30:10,680 --> 00:30:11,519
Mr. Shen!

706
00:30:12,050 --> 00:30:12,960
- Mr. Shen.
- Welcome.

707
00:30:12,960 --> 00:30:13,759
Shen!

708
00:30:13,759 --> 00:30:14,840
Why'd you bring gifts?

709
00:30:14,999 --> 00:30:16,319
Why bring gifts?

710
00:30:16,319 --> 00:30:16,880
Yeah.

711
00:30:16,880 --> 00:30:18,079
Happy Mid-Autumn!

712
00:30:18,479 --> 00:30:19,479
In-laws!

713
00:30:19,479 --> 00:30:20,700
- Happy holiday.
- Welcome, In-laws!

714
00:30:21,719 --> 00:30:22,680
How's everything?

715
00:30:24,279 --> 00:30:26,120
When's the due date?

716
00:30:26,479 --> 00:30:27,160
Next month.

717
00:30:27,559 --> 00:30:28,600
Next month?

718
00:30:29,840 --> 00:30:30,799
Next month, I...

719
00:30:31,239 --> 00:30:31,799
You...

720
00:30:32,440 --> 00:30:32,999
Well...

721
00:30:32,999 --> 00:30:34,799
Don't get nervous, okay?

722
00:30:34,799 --> 00:30:37,160
If anything comes up, just tell me.

723
00:30:42,559 --> 00:30:43,279
Give it to me.

724
00:30:44,360 --> 00:30:45,039
Zhidong.

725
00:30:45,759 --> 00:30:46,719
Zhixia. Brother-in-law.

726
00:30:49,799 --> 00:30:51,039
Slowly does it.

727
00:30:51,079 --> 00:30:52,600
Okay, close the door.

728
00:30:52,880 --> 00:30:54,079
- Zhixia.
- Jiao.

729
00:30:55,239 --> 00:30:56,400
Uncle! Auntie!

730
00:30:56,400 --> 00:30:58,079
Here comes the little one in the belly.

731
00:30:58,079 --> 00:30:58,759
Zhidong.

732
00:30:59,079 --> 00:31:00,999
You upgraded your ride and everything.

733
00:31:02,279 --> 00:31:03,120
Zero down payment.

734
00:31:03,319 --> 00:31:05,319
Chen is always coming back for checkups,

735
00:31:05,319 --> 00:31:07,559
so it's easier to visit Mom and Dad
and my two sisters.

736
00:31:07,559 --> 00:31:08,410
It's more convenient.

737
00:31:08,920 --> 00:31:09,960
Zhixia, don't freak out.

738
00:31:10,239 --> 00:31:12,400
You will get your money back.

739
00:31:12,400 --> 00:31:13,050
Never mind that.

740
00:31:13,640 --> 00:31:14,840
Zhixia, honestly,

741
00:31:15,559 --> 00:31:17,880
just return
all the money Zhidong paid back.

742
00:31:18,160 --> 00:31:19,920
We'll just drive the car home
after dinner.

743
00:31:20,360 --> 00:31:21,440
- Works for me.
- Let's go.

744
00:31:21,440 --> 00:31:22,079
How about now?

745
00:31:22,079 --> 00:31:22,920
Here are the keys.

746
00:31:22,920 --> 00:31:24,440
Zhang Hao, you only grow face,

747
00:31:24,920 --> 00:31:25,999
not brain cells.

748
00:31:26,360 --> 00:31:27,880
Once a car rolls out of the dealership,

749
00:31:27,880 --> 00:31:29,160
it becomes a used car.

750
00:31:29,160 --> 00:31:30,519
It tanks in value immediately.

751
00:31:30,519 --> 00:31:31,200
Use your head.

752
00:31:31,210 --> 00:31:32,850
- It's not worth anything.
- Take it back.

753
00:31:32,880 --> 00:31:33,999
You little cheapskate.

754
00:31:33,999 --> 00:31:35,840
If you break the keys again,
you'll need a new one.

755
00:31:35,840 --> 00:31:37,160
Look at Auntie's belly.

756
00:31:37,160 --> 00:31:37,680
Let me touch it.

757
00:31:37,680 --> 00:31:38,719
Wow, it's really popped.

758
00:31:39,840 --> 00:31:40,440
For real.

759
00:31:40,640 --> 00:31:42,559
(Shen Restaurant)
Their pork chops are amazing.

760
00:31:42,559 --> 00:31:43,950
- Super famous.
- None of us has been here.

761
00:31:43,960 --> 00:31:44,719
You should try.

762
00:31:44,719 --> 00:31:45,160
Never mind.

763
00:31:45,160 --> 00:31:45,960
Our car's a beast.

764
00:31:45,960 --> 00:31:46,559
Nope.

765
00:31:46,559 --> 00:31:47,079
It's right by the school.

766
00:31:47,079 --> 00:31:48,360
Come on, have a seat.

767
00:31:48,360 --> 00:31:51,279
We're here!

768
00:31:51,759 --> 00:31:52,880
Here we come!

769
00:31:52,880 --> 00:31:54,479
Hi, Second Mom.

770
00:31:54,479 --> 00:31:55,680
How're you doing, Bichen?

771
00:31:56,160 --> 00:31:57,479
Hey sweetheart, how've you been?

772
00:31:57,479 --> 00:31:58,840
Why'd you bring gifts?

773
00:31:58,840 --> 00:31:59,519
It's nice.

774
00:31:59,519 --> 00:32:00,719
Grandpa, Grandma.

775
00:32:00,719 --> 00:32:02,079
Why are you so sweet?

776
00:32:02,079 --> 00:32:03,160
What's your name?

777
00:32:03,160 --> 00:32:03,799
Jiao.

778
00:32:03,799 --> 00:32:04,400
How're you?

779
00:32:04,400 --> 00:32:05,640
I'm good. How're you?

780
00:32:05,640 --> 00:32:06,160
I'm good.

781
00:32:06,479 --> 00:32:07,400
Come on in.

782
00:32:07,600 --> 00:32:08,360
Sit inside.

783
00:32:08,360 --> 00:32:09,120
Jiao!

784
00:32:09,120 --> 00:32:09,680
Come sit.

785
00:32:09,680 --> 00:32:10,120
Okay.

786
00:32:10,120 --> 00:32:10,719
Sit, brother-in-law.

787
00:32:10,719 --> 00:32:11,400
- Alright.
- Minghui!

788
00:32:11,400 --> 00:32:12,400
Did you miss Grandma?

789
00:32:12,400 --> 00:32:13,079
Yeah.

790
00:32:14,160 --> 00:32:15,559
Jiao, grab the camera.

791
00:32:15,559 --> 00:32:16,680
Did you call me?

792
00:32:16,680 --> 00:32:17,319
Yeah.

793
00:32:17,319 --> 00:32:18,319
Hi, Grandpa.

794
00:32:19,640 --> 00:32:20,079
Dad.

795
00:32:20,079 --> 00:32:20,600
Coming.

796
00:32:20,600 --> 00:32:21,279
Come on, come on.

797
00:32:21,640 --> 00:32:22,360
Hang on.

798
00:32:22,600 --> 00:32:24,039
Second Mom!

799
00:32:24,039 --> 00:32:25,079
- Your gift.
- Come on.

800
00:32:25,079 --> 00:32:27,319
Take it easy.

801
00:32:27,319 --> 00:32:28,960
- You're too kind.
- Slow down.

802
00:32:28,960 --> 00:32:29,840
Zhang Hao.

803
00:32:31,039 --> 00:32:32,039
Don't call him Zhang Hao.

804
00:32:32,039 --> 00:32:32,999
He's Director Zhang now.

805
00:32:33,999 --> 00:32:34,999
Director Zhang.

806
00:32:34,999 --> 00:32:35,759
She made me do it.

807
00:32:35,880 --> 00:32:37,039
What, she's bullying you?

808
00:32:37,039 --> 00:32:38,050
She bullies me every day.

809
00:32:38,840 --> 00:32:39,920
Director Zhang, well...

810
00:32:39,920 --> 00:32:42,039
If she bullies you, just put up with it.

811
00:32:42,039 --> 00:32:42,759
Alright.

812
00:32:42,759 --> 00:32:43,880
Great job.

813
00:32:44,239 --> 00:32:44,880
It's nothing.

814
00:32:44,880 --> 00:32:46,640
Honestly, I just feel like...

815
00:32:47,039 --> 00:32:47,640
Well...

816
00:32:47,719 --> 00:32:49,600
I feel like I owe my eldest girl.

817
00:32:49,600 --> 00:32:50,200
Really.

818
00:32:51,719 --> 00:32:53,519
Feels like our whole family

819
00:32:53,519 --> 00:32:54,960
has been leaning on her

820
00:32:54,960 --> 00:32:56,880
and relying on her.

821
00:32:57,799 --> 00:32:59,559
Along the way,

822
00:33:00,880 --> 00:33:03,840
we've dragged Zhang Hao
and Jiao into it too.

823
00:33:03,840 --> 00:33:05,160
In my heart,

824
00:33:05,160 --> 00:33:07,920
I've always been very aware of that.

825
00:33:08,680 --> 00:33:10,640
I just never knew
how to make it up to her.

826
00:33:10,640 --> 00:33:11,400
So this...

827
00:33:11,400 --> 00:33:12,920
Even though it's
"for sons, not daughters,"

828
00:33:12,920 --> 00:33:14,759
but in my heart,

829
00:33:14,759 --> 00:33:17,160
you're the real pillar of this family.

830
00:33:17,160 --> 00:33:18,920
You're basically a big silly boy.

831
00:33:18,920 --> 00:33:21,079
Honestly, I've wanted
to give this to you.

832
00:33:21,640 --> 00:33:22,880
I thought if I kept wearing it,

833
00:33:22,880 --> 00:33:24,759
I could save up some blessings for you.

834
00:33:24,920 --> 00:33:25,559
Here.

835
00:33:25,840 --> 00:33:26,840
Alright, put it on.

836
00:33:28,079 --> 00:33:28,759
What?

837
00:33:29,920 --> 00:33:31,120
You...

838
00:33:31,120 --> 00:33:31,759
Mom.

839
00:33:32,519 --> 00:33:34,519
You keep wearing it.

840
00:33:34,519 --> 00:33:36,559
Didn't you say
you were saving up blessings?

841
00:33:37,079 --> 00:33:39,239
Look at us now.
We're so many people in one big family.

842
00:33:39,239 --> 00:33:41,560
That little bit of blessing
won't be enough for all of us.

843
00:33:41,840 --> 00:33:42,559
Besides,

844
00:33:43,120 --> 00:33:43,920
what you just said

845
00:33:44,920 --> 00:33:46,640
is worth way more than a gold ring.

846
00:33:48,120 --> 00:33:49,200
My girl…

847
00:33:49,590 --> 00:33:50,400
I don't drink this.

848
00:33:50,400 --> 00:33:51,079
I know.

849
00:33:51,200 --> 00:33:52,600
Everyone has to try the huangjiu.

850
00:33:52,600 --> 00:33:53,200
Come on.

851
00:33:53,200 --> 00:33:54,920
I've had this bottle tucked away

852
00:33:54,920 --> 00:33:55,759
for 20 years.

853
00:33:56,039 --> 00:33:56,799
Go on, pour it.

854
00:33:56,799 --> 00:33:57,279
Zhang Hao...

855
00:33:57,279 --> 00:33:58,920
Pregnant women can't drink.

856
00:33:58,920 --> 00:33:59,559
Right, no drinking.

857
00:33:59,559 --> 00:34:00,200
There's nothing in it.

858
00:34:00,200 --> 00:34:01,060
- Indeed.
- Come on.

859
00:34:01,160 --> 00:34:02,360
Here you go.

860
00:34:02,360 --> 00:34:03,640
A thirty-year-old bottle.

861
00:34:03,640 --> 00:34:04,160
Great!

862
00:34:04,160 --> 00:34:05,999
- Thank you!
- A thirty-year-old bottle.

863
00:34:05,999 --> 00:34:06,479
Just a sip.

864
00:34:06,479 --> 00:34:09,039
Mr. Shen is really bleeding money today.

865
00:34:09,320 --> 00:34:10,400
It's 20 years old.

866
00:34:10,400 --> 00:34:11,559
Fine, 20 years.

867
00:34:12,440 --> 00:34:13,519
Okay.

868
00:34:13,760 --> 00:34:16,599
It's rare to have
every single one of us together.

869
00:34:17,400 --> 00:34:18,079
I think

870
00:34:18,720 --> 00:34:20,360
a family dinner should be at home.

871
00:34:20,920 --> 00:34:21,920
It feels more meaningful.

872
00:34:22,679 --> 00:34:23,440
Though a bit tiring

873
00:34:23,450 --> 00:34:25,240
for our head chef and sous chef.

874
00:34:25,240 --> 00:34:26,159
Tiring? Not at all.

875
00:34:26,159 --> 00:34:27,039
Thank you.

876
00:34:28,039 --> 00:34:29,679
I gathered everyone here

877
00:34:30,360 --> 00:34:31,840
because

878
00:34:32,280 --> 00:34:33,519
a lot of things happened to me.

879
00:34:33,519 --> 00:34:35,199
Things I never saw coming.

880
00:34:36,400 --> 00:34:37,920
And I made you all worry.

881
00:34:39,880 --> 00:34:41,559
I'm not strong enough

882
00:34:42,360 --> 00:34:44,360
to handle everything on my own.

883
00:34:45,519 --> 00:34:47,360
Luckily, I had all of you by my side,

884
00:34:47,920 --> 00:34:49,559
giving me so much love,

885
00:34:50,159 --> 00:34:51,079
and so much strength.

886
00:34:52,400 --> 00:34:53,920
I'd like to thank all of you.

887
00:34:55,599 --> 00:34:56,920
Cheers.

888
00:34:56,920 --> 00:34:57,720
Let's stand up.

889
00:34:57,960 --> 00:34:58,840
Okay, let's stand up.

890
00:34:58,840 --> 00:34:59,720
All of us?

891
00:35:00,119 --> 00:35:00,720
Okay.

892
00:35:01,920 --> 00:35:02,519
Okay.

893
00:35:02,920 --> 00:35:03,400
Alright.

894
00:35:05,840 --> 00:35:06,720
Everyone, grab a seat.

895
00:35:06,720 --> 00:35:07,639
Grab a seat.

896
00:35:07,760 --> 00:35:08,320
Have a seat.

897
00:35:09,320 --> 00:35:11,400
There's one more thing
I want to tell everyone.

898
00:35:11,920 --> 00:35:13,400
My restaurant

899
00:35:13,800 --> 00:35:15,519
has been acquired
by Manting Hotel Group.

900
00:35:16,800 --> 00:35:19,199
They also invited me
to join their operations team

901
00:35:19,199 --> 00:35:20,679
after I have the baby.

902
00:35:21,880 --> 00:35:22,920
And thank you

903
00:35:23,159 --> 00:35:24,840
for everything you did
to help the hotel.

904
00:35:24,840 --> 00:35:26,240
Is it that Manting?

905
00:35:26,920 --> 00:35:28,159
They must've paid a lot.

906
00:35:29,320 --> 00:35:30,639
We got our principal back.

907
00:35:30,639 --> 00:35:31,920
And even earned twenty grand.

908
00:35:32,400 --> 00:35:33,720
You even made money!

909
00:35:33,800 --> 00:35:34,320
Nice.

910
00:35:34,479 --> 00:35:35,280
That's great.

911
00:35:35,559 --> 00:35:36,800
It's great!

912
00:35:36,800 --> 00:35:37,860
And there's one more thing.

913
00:35:38,280 --> 00:35:39,599
Mom and Meiqi

914
00:35:39,599 --> 00:35:41,280
are starting a new business again.

915
00:35:41,360 --> 00:35:41,880
Yes.

916
00:35:41,880 --> 00:35:43,639
I fully support you two.

917
00:35:43,920 --> 00:35:45,920
But I don't know anything
about your line of work.

918
00:35:46,119 --> 00:35:48,360
I won't get too involved, okay, Mom?

919
00:35:48,360 --> 00:35:48,920
Alright.

920
00:35:48,920 --> 00:35:49,920
Come on, sit, sit.

921
00:35:50,639 --> 00:35:51,199
Okay.

922
00:35:51,679 --> 00:35:53,240
Thank you, thank you everyone.

923
00:35:53,240 --> 00:35:55,079
Look at all the things
our family's been through.

924
00:35:55,079 --> 00:35:56,280
Everyone stepped in to help.

925
00:35:56,400 --> 00:35:57,240
Thank you.

926
00:35:58,880 --> 00:36:00,159
Let me say just a few words.

927
00:36:00,240 --> 00:36:01,159
Go ahead.

928
00:36:01,559 --> 00:36:02,320
Mingzhu.

929
00:36:03,039 --> 00:36:04,400
Once the baby is born,

930
00:36:04,599 --> 00:36:07,240
whether the child takes Feng, or Shen,

931
00:36:07,400 --> 00:36:09,159
or Xu, or Yu,

932
00:36:09,800 --> 00:36:11,400
none of that really matters.

933
00:36:11,880 --> 00:36:12,920
What matters is

934
00:36:13,240 --> 00:36:14,320
you're the mother.

935
00:36:15,400 --> 00:36:18,039
All the rights over the child
are in your hands.

936
00:36:19,119 --> 00:36:19,760
And

937
00:36:19,840 --> 00:36:21,679
I just hope from now on,

938
00:36:21,679 --> 00:36:23,400
you live by your own heart,

939
00:36:23,400 --> 00:36:25,720
and live freely, however you want.

940
00:36:25,999 --> 00:36:27,920
As long as you're happy, that's enough.

941
00:36:29,240 --> 00:36:30,039
Thanks, Mom.

942
00:36:33,599 --> 00:36:34,920
Today I'm making the call.

943
00:36:35,519 --> 00:36:36,119
Bichen,

944
00:36:36,760 --> 00:36:38,880
I'm giving you
this bracelet on Mom's behalf.

945
00:36:38,880 --> 00:36:39,519
No, no...

946
00:36:39,519 --> 00:36:41,039
Mingzhu, that bracelet is yours.

947
00:36:41,039 --> 00:36:41,800
No, Mingzhu.

948
00:36:41,920 --> 00:36:42,880
We can't take that.

949
00:36:43,840 --> 00:36:44,920
You didn't grow up

950
00:36:45,599 --> 00:36:47,320
at home with us when you were little.

951
00:36:47,370 --> 00:36:49,760
This is Mom making it up to you.
It's what you should have.

952
00:36:49,760 --> 00:36:51,240
That's all in the past.

953
00:36:51,479 --> 00:36:52,760
We should look forward.

954
00:36:53,280 --> 00:36:54,079
Besides,

955
00:36:54,679 --> 00:36:55,920
you said we're a family.

956
00:36:56,199 --> 00:36:57,880
This bracelet has to go to Bichen.

957
00:36:57,880 --> 00:36:58,920
Mingzhu, listen to me.

958
00:37:00,599 --> 00:37:01,639
You've moved past it.

959
00:37:01,639 --> 00:37:03,119
But the rest of us haven't.

960
00:37:03,840 --> 00:37:05,559
We should be treating you twice as well.

961
00:37:05,559 --> 00:37:06,920
How could we take something

962
00:37:07,240 --> 00:37:08,519
this valuable from you?

963
00:37:09,159 --> 00:37:10,119
As for Chen,

964
00:37:10,559 --> 00:37:11,800
I'll buy her one later.

965
00:37:11,880 --> 00:37:12,920
I can wait.

966
00:37:13,280 --> 00:37:13,840
Zhidong,

967
00:37:14,519 --> 00:37:15,599
I'm your big sister.

968
00:37:16,159 --> 00:37:17,280
You need to listen to me.

969
00:37:17,920 --> 00:37:19,360
This bracelet has to go to Bichen.

970
00:37:20,240 --> 00:37:21,519
Ever since she married you,

971
00:37:21,920 --> 00:37:23,760
she's put up with a lot.

972
00:37:24,599 --> 00:37:25,559
Consider this bracelet

973
00:37:25,920 --> 00:37:29,039
your family's love for her.

974
00:37:29,240 --> 00:37:29,760
Here.

975
00:37:30,880 --> 00:37:31,840
No, Mingzhu.

976
00:37:32,599 --> 00:37:34,320
Dad, Mom.

977
00:37:36,760 --> 00:37:38,280
Don't you think I'm right?

978
00:37:45,840 --> 00:37:46,400
Madam Yu,

979
00:37:47,679 --> 00:37:48,679
she's talking to you.

980
00:37:49,400 --> 00:37:49,999
Mom.

981
00:38:00,599 --> 00:38:01,199
Mom.

982
00:38:01,199 --> 00:38:02,400
She's asking for your opinion.

983
00:38:03,519 --> 00:38:05,840
Yes, she's right.

984
00:38:06,079 --> 00:38:06,880
Absolutely right.

985
00:38:06,880 --> 00:38:07,679
Come on, Bichen.

986
00:38:11,620 --> 00:38:13,400
You two have to
treat each other well, okay?

987
00:38:14,320 --> 00:38:15,240
Thank you, Mingzhu.

988
00:38:16,039 --> 00:38:17,079
Thank you, Mingzhu.

989
00:38:20,519 --> 00:38:21,240
Come on, sit.

990
00:38:25,079 --> 00:38:26,800
And lastly, I want to thank Mom and Dad.

991
00:38:26,920 --> 00:38:28,400
Why're you thanking us?

992
00:38:28,400 --> 00:38:29,710
- Yeah.
- After all these years,

993
00:38:30,079 --> 00:38:31,760
you two have done so much

994
00:38:31,760 --> 00:38:32,920
for me and Minghui.

995
00:38:33,280 --> 00:38:35,360
You barely had time to travel.

996
00:38:35,840 --> 00:38:36,720
So now,

997
00:38:37,119 --> 00:38:39,679
before you officially
become grandparents,

998
00:38:40,519 --> 00:38:41,639
go home for a visit.

999
00:38:41,639 --> 00:38:42,639
No, you...

1000
00:38:42,639 --> 00:38:44,280
I already bought your plane tickets.

1001
00:38:44,519 --> 00:38:45,720
Just go and enjoy yourselves.

1002
00:38:46,360 --> 00:38:47,400
Once the baby's here,

1003
00:38:48,050 --> 00:38:49,320
you can come back and help out.

1004
00:38:49,320 --> 00:38:50,760
I covered half the tickets too.

1005
00:38:50,920 --> 00:38:51,720
I've never

1006
00:38:51,720 --> 00:38:52,639
seen snow myself.

1007
00:38:52,840 --> 00:38:54,559
Next time you go back,
you have to take me.

1008
00:38:56,119 --> 00:38:57,240
Okay, we'll take you.

1009
00:38:58,039 --> 00:38:58,639
Mingzhu,

1010
00:38:58,639 --> 00:38:59,720
let's toast Mom and Dad.

1011
00:39:00,240 --> 00:39:00,920
Mom, Dad,

1012
00:39:01,400 --> 00:39:03,199
no matter what you decide to do,

1013
00:39:03,880 --> 00:39:05,079
we're behind you.

1014
00:39:05,479 --> 00:39:06,159
My girl.

1015
00:39:07,530 --> 00:39:08,400
Thank you, sweetheart.

1016
00:39:10,599 --> 00:39:11,400
And me?

1017
00:39:11,599 --> 00:39:12,400
You too.

1018
00:39:12,920 --> 00:39:14,119
But Mingzhu...

1019
00:39:15,320 --> 00:39:16,559
Nothing to do with me now?

1020
00:39:16,720 --> 00:39:18,039
What about my part?

1021
00:39:19,119 --> 00:39:19,800
Sister.

1022
00:39:20,320 --> 00:39:21,760
Wish you a smooth delivery.

1023
00:39:22,519 --> 00:39:23,800
Thanks, my little sister.

1024
00:39:24,599 --> 00:39:25,920
May all go smoothly.

1025
00:39:29,559 --> 00:39:30,679
Now that Mingzhu's done,

1026
00:39:31,720 --> 00:39:32,599
I'll say a few words.

1027
00:39:34,760 --> 00:39:36,079
Today's a good day.

1028
00:39:36,720 --> 00:39:38,119
Thank you all for coming

1029
00:39:38,840 --> 00:39:40,039
to my humble little place.

1030
00:39:41,840 --> 00:39:43,400
We finally got everyone together.

1031
00:39:44,360 --> 00:39:45,240
Look.

1032
00:39:45,530 --> 00:39:46,880
"Brought together under one roof."

1033
00:39:47,920 --> 00:39:48,800
This reunion

1034
00:39:50,119 --> 00:39:51,599
was brought to us by Mingzhu.

1035
00:39:52,360 --> 00:39:53,400
If it weren't for her,

1036
00:39:54,320 --> 00:39:56,920
I doubt we'd all be sitting here.

1037
00:39:58,039 --> 00:39:59,400
We're not technically one family,

1038
00:39:59,639 --> 00:40:00,920
but better than one.

1039
00:40:02,159 --> 00:40:03,079
There's an old saying,

1040
00:40:03,320 --> 00:40:05,280
"If you're not family,
you might as well be one."

1041
00:40:05,639 --> 00:40:07,119
All these years, my wife and I

1042
00:40:08,240 --> 00:40:10,760
have been working our way
from the north down to the south.

1043
00:40:12,039 --> 00:40:13,400
It really wasn't easy.

1044
00:40:14,639 --> 00:40:16,599
Honestly, we're just ordinary people.

1045
00:40:17,360 --> 00:40:18,519
All we ever wanted

1046
00:40:19,240 --> 00:40:20,639
was to live decent lives,

1047
00:40:21,079 --> 00:40:22,400
work hard, and stay honest.

1048
00:40:23,960 --> 00:40:26,039
But in our hearts,
it was always our daughter first.

1049
00:40:26,599 --> 00:40:27,840
I'm grateful to our kids.

1050
00:40:28,599 --> 00:40:31,400
They taught us how to be parents.

1051
00:40:32,119 --> 00:40:34,280
Don't cry. Just hear me out.

1052
00:40:35,400 --> 00:40:37,920
If this little home of ours can be okay,

1053
00:40:38,240 --> 00:40:39,800
then all of us will be okay.

1054
00:40:39,920 --> 00:40:42,400
I just hope every family here

1055
00:40:42,400 --> 00:40:44,639
stays safe, healthy,

1056
00:40:44,999 --> 00:40:46,199
and happy.

1057
00:40:47,410 --> 00:40:48,800
Harmony makes everything flourish.

1058
00:40:50,079 --> 00:40:52,039
I'm not great with speeches.

1059
00:40:52,199 --> 00:40:53,720
Let me perform something instead.

1060
00:40:53,920 --> 00:40:55,599
Alright, alright!

1061
00:40:56,199 --> 00:40:57,920
Minghui, help your dad out.

1062
00:40:58,760 --> 00:41:00,920
Jump in and back me up.

1063
00:41:00,920 --> 00:41:02,159
That beat-boots thing you do.

1064
00:41:02,159 --> 00:41:03,559
Dad, it's beatbox.

1065
00:41:03,920 --> 00:41:05,039
Drop the beat, right?

1066
00:41:05,039 --> 00:41:06,800
Drop the beat!

1067
00:41:06,800 --> 00:41:07,320
Here we go.

1068
00:41:12,479 --> 00:41:16,519
Your mom says
I've always been a bit clueless.

1069
00:41:18,920 --> 00:41:20,639
She says I'm carefree,

1070
00:41:20,639 --> 00:41:22,679
laughing all day,

1071
00:41:22,679 --> 00:41:24,760
scatterbrained and softhearted.

1072
00:41:24,760 --> 00:41:29,039
Just a big silly fool.

1073
00:41:29,039 --> 00:41:30,079
A big fool.

1074
00:41:30,079 --> 00:41:31,159
A big fool, yep.

1075
00:41:31,400 --> 00:41:32,400
Tell me this.

1076
00:41:32,400 --> 00:41:36,320
If someone dropped
a gold ingot right on the street,

1077
00:41:36,559 --> 00:41:38,079
and it wasn't mine,

1078
00:41:38,079 --> 00:41:40,360
how could I take it?

1079
00:41:40,360 --> 00:41:41,039
Of course not!

1080
00:41:41,039 --> 00:41:44,760
If a whole hill bloomed
with golden chrysanthemums,

1081
00:41:44,840 --> 00:41:46,360
and they weren't mine,

1082
00:41:46,360 --> 00:41:48,599
why would I pick them?

1083
00:41:48,599 --> 00:41:50,559
I wouldn't!

1084
00:41:50,920 --> 00:41:54,199
If golden radishes grew in the field,

1085
00:41:55,039 --> 00:41:56,559
and they weren't mine,

1086
00:41:56,559 --> 00:41:59,039
how could I pull them up?

1087
00:41:59,159 --> 00:42:02,720
If a gold frog jumped out of the river,

1088
00:42:03,280 --> 00:42:04,840
and it wasn't mine,

1089
00:42:04,840 --> 00:42:06,880
why would I grab it?

1090
00:42:06,920 --> 00:42:09,400
Gold ingot, gold flowers, gold radish...

1091
00:42:09,400 --> 00:42:10,079
Jianqi.

1092
00:42:10,079 --> 00:42:10,880
Gold frog!

1093
00:42:10,880 --> 00:42:12,639
Our family is finally here together.

1094
00:42:13,400 --> 00:42:14,199
And don't worry.

1095
00:42:14,679 --> 00:42:17,400
From now on,
we're all going to be just fine.
