when we were at the cemetery.

00:02:25,480 --> 00:02:26,159
Thankfully,

17
00:02:27,599 --> 00:02:28,800
Mingzhu was smart

18
00:02:29,570 --> 00:02:31,380
and transferred her wedding house
to herself.

Something so serious
happened to Meiqi's family?

26
00:02:52,399 --> 00:02:53,480
All of Nanxi knows this.

27
00:02:53,480 --> 00:02:54,360
You don't know?

28
00:02:54,440 --> 00:02:56,040
Don't you read the classmate group chat?

29
00:02:58,480 --> 00:02:59,480
I don't.

30
00:03:00,559 --> 00:03:03,119
How did you join the gathering
if you didn't read it?

31
00:03:03,839 --> 00:03:05,559
How did you meet Feng Meiqi again?

32
00:03:06,879 --> 00:03:08,159
I...

33
00:03:08,170 --> 00:03:10,200
I stopped reading it
after I got together with you.

34
00:03:10,480 --> 00:03:13,760
Many lessons are given
in the third year. I'm very busy.

35
00:03:14,960 --> 00:03:17,240
Mr. Hu, you are a good man.

36
00:03:17,480 --> 00:03:18,559
A reward for you.

37
00:03:22,839 --> 00:03:23,399
Then...

38
00:03:23,999 --> 00:03:25,399
How is Meiqi doing now?

39
00:03:28,080 --> 00:03:29,040
Can I ask?

40
00:03:30,080 --> 00:03:31,320
Of course, you can.

41
00:03:34,119 --> 00:03:37,080
Meiqi... She's in bad shape now.

42
00:03:38,159 --> 00:03:39,559
As a former classmate

43
00:03:39,559 --> 00:03:40,839
and ex-boyfriend of hers,

44
00:03:41,080 --> 00:03:42,200
you should help her out.

45
00:03:44,800 --> 00:03:45,839
How?

46
00:03:47,559 --> 00:03:48,360
Speak to her

47
00:03:48,650 --> 00:03:49,640
and treat her to a meal?

48
00:03:49,670 --> 00:03:51,119
Don't forget a hug filled with love.

49
00:03:52,760 --> 00:03:53,839
Can I even do that?

50
00:03:53,839 --> 00:03:54,760
What do you think?

51
00:03:55,960 --> 00:03:56,800
I don't think so.

52
00:03:56,800 --> 00:03:58,510
Have you been studying so much
that you've turned into a fool?

53
00:03:58,520 --> 00:03:59,599
Don't you know

54
00:03:59,599 --> 00:04:00,640
what you can and cannot do?

55
00:04:02,119 --> 00:04:03,360
I don't know.

56
00:04:03,679 --> 00:04:04,879
Teach me.

57
00:04:04,879 --> 00:04:05,960
What should I do?

58
00:04:07,599 --> 00:04:08,480
Let me tell you.

59
00:04:08,839 --> 00:04:10,040
Feng Meiqi

60
00:04:10,040 --> 00:04:11,320
will surely lose her house.

61
00:04:11,879 --> 00:04:13,460
Before the court seizes the house,

62
00:04:13,470 --> 00:04:15,460
bring as many things as you can
out of the house.

63
00:04:16,719 --> 00:04:17,599
Isn't that illegal?

64
00:04:17,599 --> 00:04:18,880
How is that illegal?

65
00:04:18,880 --> 00:04:21,660
Feng's family put the house on a mortgage
and not the items inside it.

66
00:04:25,399 --> 00:04:26,039
Let's go.

67
00:04:26,239 --> 00:04:26,799
Mister.

68
00:04:26,880 --> 00:04:28,281
The plug.

69
00:04:28,440 --> 00:04:29,000
The plug.

70
00:04:32,719 --> 00:04:33,960
(In this family,)

71
00:04:34,359 --> 00:04:35,440
(I am pregnant,)

72
00:04:35,880 --> 00:04:37,120
(Feng Meiqi is unemployed)

73
00:04:37,760 --> 00:04:39,880
(and my mother-in-law can't even work.)

74
00:04:41,479 --> 00:04:43,120
(We are willing to take on the debt)

75
00:04:43,399 --> 00:04:43,799
Mingzhu.

76
00:04:43,799 --> 00:04:46,039
(but the people owing money
must first survive)

77
00:04:46,039 --> 00:04:47,490
(before they can pay the money back.)

78
00:04:47,640 --> 00:04:48,239
It's fine.

79
00:04:48,399 --> 00:04:50,799
(Television, computer,
hair drying machine,)

80
00:04:51,239 --> 00:04:53,440
(sofa, coffee table, refrigerator,)

81
00:04:53,680 --> 00:04:55,479
(and Meiqi's luxury items.)

82
00:04:55,650 --> 00:04:58,320
(We'll find buyers before
we sell them to second-hand resellers.)

83
00:04:59,200 --> 00:05:00,320
(What we need to do now)

84
00:05:00,560 --> 00:05:01,560
(is to turn everything)

85
00:05:02,039 --> 00:05:03,799
(into cold hard cash.)

86
00:05:06,839 --> 00:05:07,479
Hello.

87
00:05:08,799 --> 00:05:09,359
Hello.

88
00:05:09,479 --> 00:05:11,039
We are here to see the dining table.

89
00:05:11,039 --> 00:05:12,880
Yes. This is the dining table.

90
00:05:13,320 --> 00:05:14,239
Take a look.

91
00:05:14,350 --> 00:05:15,919
This dining table is made from redwood.

92
00:05:15,919 --> 00:05:17,359
The materials are very good.

93
00:05:18,919 --> 00:05:19,320
Yes.

94
00:05:19,320 --> 00:05:20,560
My dad asked a factory

95
00:05:20,560 --> 00:05:22,039
to customize it.

96
00:05:22,350 --> 00:05:23,799
Even the carvings were done by hand.

97
00:05:24,120 --> 00:05:25,399
I'm sure you spent a lot

98
00:05:25,399 --> 00:05:26,760
buying this back then.

99
00:05:27,120 --> 00:05:27,719
Yes.

100
00:05:27,799 --> 00:05:29,880
It was more than 100,000 yuan
after the discount.

101
00:05:29,919 --> 00:05:31,399
20,000 for it now

102
00:05:31,599 --> 00:05:32,440
is a steal.

103
00:05:33,719 --> 00:05:35,039
20,000 yuan is not expensive.

104
00:05:35,039 --> 00:05:36,060
It's made with real wood.

105
00:05:36,070 --> 00:05:37,680
You can't even move it with a few people.

106
00:05:38,039 --> 00:05:38,880
This is a good item.

107
00:05:38,960 --> 00:05:41,120
Yes. It's pure redwood.

108
00:05:41,120 --> 00:05:42,399
Moreover, it holds its value.

109
00:05:43,359 --> 00:05:44,919
We've been taking good care of it.

110
00:05:44,919 --> 00:05:46,399
It doesn't have any scratches.

111
00:05:46,399 --> 00:05:48,560
Look. The shine is still there.

112
00:05:48,880 --> 00:05:49,719
Yes.

113
00:05:49,719 --> 00:05:51,490
If you are interested
in this dining table,

114
00:05:51,919 --> 00:05:53,479
I'll just give you the chairs as well.

115
00:05:53,480 --> 00:05:54,200
- Is that so?
- Such a good deal?

116
00:05:54,200 --> 00:05:54,719
Yes.

117
00:05:55,910 --> 00:05:56,719
The chairs are good.

118
00:05:56,719 --> 00:05:57,760
Sure. We'll take them.

119
00:05:57,760 --> 00:05:59,320
I'll ask two people to move it later.

120
00:05:59,680 --> 00:06:00,880
Sure.

121
00:06:00,880 --> 00:06:02,560
Scan my QR code.

122
00:06:02,560 --> 00:06:03,000
Sure.

123
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:04,359
Let me move the box away.

124
00:06:04,479 --> 00:06:05,080
Kid,

125
00:06:05,080 --> 00:06:07,239
we don't include delivery fees.

126
00:06:07,239 --> 00:06:07,760
No problem.

127
00:06:10,070 --> 00:06:12,320
You can take a look at
the other furniture in this house.

128
00:06:12,320 --> 00:06:14,359
If you see anything you like,
you can buy it too.

129
00:06:14,359 --> 00:06:16,050
Are you selling this sofa?
It's quite nice.

130
00:06:16,399 --> 00:06:16,960
Yes.

131
00:06:17,799 --> 00:06:18,399
No!

132
00:06:21,039 --> 00:06:21,599
No!

133
00:06:24,799 --> 00:06:26,599
Feng loves it the most.

134
00:06:27,760 --> 00:06:29,120
It's not for sale at any price.

135
00:06:36,160 --> 00:06:37,887
What's wrong
with something used by Feng?

136
00:06:38,760 --> 00:06:39,919
Is he the emperor?

137
00:06:40,520 --> 00:06:42,359
Are his things valuable
now that he is dead?

138
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:43,880
Are they antiques now?

139
00:06:43,880 --> 00:06:47,279
Might as well seal off his grave
and charge people to visit him

140
00:06:47,279 --> 00:06:48,399
to pay the debt.

141
00:06:49,960 --> 00:06:52,159
That's enough. He's already dead.

142
00:06:52,279 --> 00:06:53,359
Why are you saying that?

143
00:06:53,359 --> 00:06:54,159
No.

144
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:56,799
People die leaving a legacy

145
00:06:56,799 --> 00:06:58,039
but he died

146
00:06:58,039 --> 00:06:59,560
leaving a lot of debt.

147
00:06:59,960 --> 00:07:01,719
How will his family live

148
00:07:01,719 --> 00:07:02,799
for the rest of their lives?

149
00:07:02,960 --> 00:07:04,000
I thought

150
00:07:04,520 --> 00:07:06,440
he was the one in his family
who was sensible.

151
00:07:06,960 --> 00:07:08,039
Now, I have realized

152
00:07:08,039 --> 00:07:09,640
Feng was the most unreliable one.

153
00:07:09,640 --> 00:07:10,680
You can't say that.

154
00:07:10,680 --> 00:07:12,399
Feng is good enough.

155
00:07:13,039 --> 00:07:16,060
If it weren't for him, his house would not
have been transferred to Mingzhu.

156
00:07:16,080 --> 00:07:17,159
Forget about it.

157
00:07:17,239 --> 00:07:18,200
Him?

158
00:07:18,200 --> 00:07:20,080
That's because Mingzhu fought for it.

159
00:07:22,560 --> 00:07:25,239
Mingzhu is like me.

160
00:07:25,239 --> 00:07:26,520
She's a good judge of character.

161
00:07:26,760 --> 00:07:28,760
She knows Feng

162
00:07:29,039 --> 00:07:30,200
is an empty shell.

163
00:07:30,440 --> 00:07:31,599
A good judge of character?

164
00:07:32,760 --> 00:07:33,760
Judge my character.

165
00:07:33,799 --> 00:07:35,120
Now?

166
00:07:35,640 --> 00:07:36,640
The first day I knew you,

167
00:07:36,640 --> 00:07:38,279
I knew my life would be over.

168
00:07:38,440 --> 00:07:39,440
I'll be trapped

169
00:07:39,560 --> 00:07:40,560
and no longer escape.

170
00:07:41,159 --> 00:07:42,320
That Yu too.

171
00:07:43,479 --> 00:07:44,520
The first day I saw her,

172
00:07:44,520 --> 00:07:46,120
I knew she wasn't a good person.

173
00:07:46,599 --> 00:07:48,320
Yu Jingxiang?

174
00:07:48,360 --> 00:07:49,320
How is she any fragrant?

175
00:07:49,320 --> 00:07:50,479
She stinks.

176
00:07:55,039 --> 00:07:56,919
Zhilu.

177
00:07:58,560 --> 00:08:00,520
I was wondering

178
00:08:01,279 --> 00:08:02,839
why Zhilu has such a terrible fate.

179
00:08:04,320 --> 00:08:05,039
Zhixia

180
00:08:05,039 --> 00:08:07,159
sent me a text on WeChat to tell me

181
00:08:07,335 --> 00:08:09,656
that Zhilu is helping the Feng family
sell their furniture.

182
00:08:10,591 --> 00:08:11,552
The furniture

183
00:08:12,680 --> 00:08:13,719
is good.

184
00:08:13,719 --> 00:08:16,000
They sold them at a cheap price.

185
00:08:16,399 --> 00:08:17,479
There was no choice.

186
00:08:18,359 --> 00:08:19,399
They were in trouble.

187
00:08:22,960 --> 00:08:26,120
Why don't we buy their furniture

188
00:08:26,680 --> 00:08:28,560
and keep it in our old house.

189
00:08:28,560 --> 00:08:30,000
After a few years,

190
00:08:30,599 --> 00:08:31,680
when the incident is over,

191
00:08:31,999 --> 00:08:33,400
we'll return it to Zhilu.

192
00:08:33,460 --> 00:08:34,239
What do you think?

193
00:08:35,239 --> 00:08:36,040
Great. Dacheng.

194
00:08:36,040 --> 00:08:38,200
Your idea is really good.

195
00:08:40,260 --> 00:08:41,119
What about the money?

196
00:08:44,530 --> 00:08:45,479
We'll sell the sidecar.

197
00:08:46,680 --> 00:08:47,839
Selling the sidecar?

198
00:08:49,239 --> 00:08:50,400
Are you willing to do that?

199
00:08:50,639 --> 00:08:53,080
We must help Zhilu after all.

200
00:08:55,284 --> 00:08:56,359
Forget it.

201
00:08:56,359 --> 00:08:58,599
That old house is leaking.

202
00:08:58,999 --> 00:09:00,400
It's damp and wet.

203
00:09:00,400 --> 00:09:01,920
The furniture will rot

204
00:09:02,400 --> 00:09:03,879
if there's acid rain.

205
00:09:04,519 --> 00:09:05,400
Besides,

206
00:09:06,620 --> 00:09:08,479
we shouldn't bite off
more than we can chew.

207
00:09:08,479 --> 00:09:09,519
Are we not going to help her?

208
00:09:09,519 --> 00:09:11,519
Of course, we are helping.

209
00:09:15,359 --> 00:09:16,280
We'll save money.

210
00:09:17,370 --> 00:09:18,400
We'll save up bit by bit.

211
00:09:18,400 --> 00:09:19,680
Let's be frugal.

212
00:09:19,999 --> 00:09:21,119
I'll quit smoking.

213
00:09:21,359 --> 00:09:22,280
That's right.

214
00:09:22,999 --> 00:09:23,879
When the time comes,

215
00:09:24,519 --> 00:09:26,519
and Zhilu gives birth

216
00:09:27,400 --> 00:09:29,160
to our grandson,

217
00:09:31,570 --> 00:09:33,519
we'll spend money and effort
to take care of him.

218
00:09:33,519 --> 00:09:34,080
All right?

219
00:09:36,759 --> 00:09:38,719
When I think about her mom...

220
00:09:38,960 --> 00:09:39,879
Her mom...

221
00:09:41,519 --> 00:09:43,960
Which mom?

222
00:09:44,519 --> 00:09:45,479
I am the mom.

223
00:09:46,359 --> 00:09:47,920
I am the biological mother.

224
00:09:53,280 --> 00:09:53,999
Three meters.

225
00:09:54,239 --> 00:09:54,879
Three meters.

226
00:09:56,639 --> 00:09:57,200
Mom.

227
00:09:57,879 --> 00:09:58,599
It won't work.

228
00:09:58,960 --> 00:10:00,519
Mingzhu's house has a small living room.

229
00:10:00,519 --> 00:10:02,280
The big sofa can't fit.

230
00:10:02,280 --> 00:10:03,680
Get rid of it then.

231
00:10:03,999 --> 00:10:04,599
Mom.

232
00:10:05,280 --> 00:10:07,119
Jianqi picked this sofa.

233
00:10:07,479 --> 00:10:08,639
I want to keep it.

234
00:10:09,160 --> 00:10:10,400
Jianqi has bad taste.

235
00:10:10,400 --> 00:10:12,119
He only picked things that look cheap.

236
00:10:12,119 --> 00:10:13,240
Why do you want to keep it?

237
00:10:14,519 --> 00:10:15,440
Forget it.

238
00:10:17,250 --> 00:10:18,239
Who are you looking for?

239
00:10:19,410 --> 00:10:21,200
Hello, we are looking for
the owner of 8001.

240
00:10:21,719 --> 00:10:22,400
I am.

241
00:10:22,400 --> 00:10:23,759
We are from

242
00:10:23,759 --> 00:10:25,119
Nanzhou New City Civil Court.

243
00:10:25,519 --> 00:10:26,260
What do you want?

244
00:10:26,400 --> 00:10:27,519
There's a mortgage

245
00:10:27,920 --> 00:10:28,879
on this house.

246
00:10:29,119 --> 00:10:31,359
According to Article 255
of the Civil Procedure Law,

247
00:10:31,360 --> 00:10:32,719
we are going to seize this place.

248
00:10:38,650 --> 00:10:39,479
This is the summons.

249
00:10:39,800 --> 00:10:40,960
Please sign it.

250
00:10:58,960 --> 00:11:00,860
Please move away
from this place within a week.

251
00:11:00,879 --> 00:11:02,140
We are going to put seals on it.

252
00:11:16,200 --> 00:11:17,359
This is over.

253
00:11:20,639 --> 00:11:22,680
We can't protect the house.

254
00:11:24,359 --> 00:11:26,320
We'll be homeless soon.

255
00:11:29,639 --> 00:11:30,239
Mom.

256
00:11:31,030 --> 00:11:32,759
Although we couldn't
protect the big house,

257
00:11:33,160 --> 00:11:34,879
we still have this small one.

258
00:11:36,080 --> 00:11:36,999
You and Meiqi

259
00:11:36,999 --> 00:11:38,320
can move here.

260
00:11:39,200 --> 00:11:41,320
Bring your sofa here as well.

261
00:11:41,759 --> 00:11:42,920
Keep an open mind.

262
00:11:48,239 --> 00:11:50,479
Your neighbors say you are toxic.

263
00:11:52,080 --> 00:11:53,119
You are really toxic.

264
00:11:55,479 --> 00:11:56,639
What are you talking about?

265
00:11:59,119 --> 00:12:00,719
When I couldn't sleep at night,

266
00:12:00,719 --> 00:12:01,680
I lay in bed

267
00:12:01,680 --> 00:12:03,960
and tumble around thinking

268
00:12:04,160 --> 00:12:04,879
why.

269
00:12:04,879 --> 00:12:05,879
Why must the Feng family

270
00:12:05,879 --> 00:12:07,999
suffer so much?

271
00:12:11,960 --> 00:12:12,879
After all,

272
00:12:13,960 --> 00:12:14,680
it's all you.

273
00:12:18,440 --> 00:12:18,999
Mom.

274
00:12:20,999 --> 00:12:22,239
It's because of me.

275
00:12:23,719 --> 00:12:24,999
I was too willful.

276
00:12:24,999 --> 00:12:26,719
It has nothing to do with Mingzhu.

277
00:12:26,839 --> 00:12:28,320
It does.

278
00:12:29,490 --> 00:12:31,280
If something hadn't happened
to your brother,

279
00:12:31,280 --> 00:12:32,879
would you return from abroad?

280
00:12:33,260 --> 00:12:34,759
If your brother weren't her boyfriend,

281
00:12:34,759 --> 00:12:35,960
would something happen to her?

282
00:12:37,800 --> 00:12:39,479
Since they got married,

283
00:12:39,960 --> 00:12:41,359
the Feng family

284
00:12:41,359 --> 00:12:43,680
has suffered one tragedy after another.

285
00:12:44,519 --> 00:12:45,879
In less than half a year,

286
00:12:46,239 --> 00:12:47,680
all the men in our family died.

287
00:12:48,759 --> 00:12:50,680
All the men in our family are dead.

288
00:12:52,680 --> 00:12:54,280
Mom.

289
00:12:55,080 --> 00:12:55,960
What are you doing?

290
00:12:55,960 --> 00:12:56,999
Who are you calling Mom?

291
00:12:57,320 --> 00:12:58,839
Go away. Don't stand here.

292
00:12:58,960 --> 00:12:59,639
I'm telling you.

293
00:12:59,639 --> 00:13:00,920
We no longer want the child.

294
00:13:00,999 --> 00:13:03,400
The Feng family is destined
to have no descendants.

295
00:13:05,879 --> 00:13:06,599
What?

296
00:13:07,560 --> 00:13:08,400
Feng Meiqi,

297
00:13:09,239 --> 00:13:11,040
don't be afraid. I'm here.

298
00:13:11,040 --> 00:13:12,239
Can you stop this?

299
00:13:13,800 --> 00:13:15,599
Can you stop this?

300
00:13:17,340 --> 00:13:18,519
Do you know the situation now?

301
00:13:19,160 --> 00:13:20,599
Do you know the situation now, Mom?

302
00:13:20,600 --> 00:13:21,920
Do we have many people in our family?

303
00:13:21,920 --> 00:13:23,639
Why are you still
chasing other people away,

304
00:13:23,639 --> 00:13:24,280
Mom?

305
00:13:24,759 --> 00:13:26,119
What's wrong with her?

306
00:13:27,879 --> 00:13:28,560
Meiqi.

307
00:13:28,960 --> 00:13:29,560
Baby.

308
00:13:30,080 --> 00:13:31,040
Don't be afraid.

309
00:13:32,040 --> 00:13:33,040
Mom,

310
00:13:33,040 --> 00:13:35,719
stop doing this.

311
00:13:36,680 --> 00:13:38,680
Don't be afraid. I'm here.

312
00:13:40,080 --> 00:13:40,759
Meiqi.

313
00:13:44,080 --> 00:13:45,719
What are you two doing?

314
00:13:47,479 --> 00:13:48,839
You were bad last night.

315
00:13:53,719 --> 00:13:54,960
This motorbike looks good.

316
00:13:55,839 --> 00:13:57,359
It also has Nanzhou plates.

317
00:13:57,560 --> 00:13:58,879
This is worth something.

318
00:13:59,719 --> 00:14:00,920
Are you selling this?

319
00:14:01,920 --> 00:14:02,960
I'm still considering it.

320
00:14:02,960 --> 00:14:04,400
I want to know the market value.

321
00:14:04,800 --> 00:14:05,680
Not bad.

322
00:14:06,519 --> 00:14:07,920
This motorcycle must be quite old.

323
00:14:08,239 --> 00:14:10,160
Ten whole years.

324
00:14:10,839 --> 00:14:12,920
But I've maintained it well.

325
00:14:12,920 --> 00:14:14,080
Listen to the engine.

326
00:14:16,239 --> 00:14:17,040
You're amazing.

327
00:14:17,040 --> 00:14:17,719
Incredible.

328
00:14:18,648 --> 00:14:20,400
You've maintained your bike well.

329
00:14:20,400 --> 00:14:21,280
It's not bad.

330
00:14:22,280 --> 00:14:24,519
You are also a bike lover.

331
00:14:24,999 --> 00:14:26,239
Why are you selling it?

332
00:14:28,920 --> 00:14:31,440
My eldest daughter is pregnant.

333
00:14:32,320 --> 00:14:34,599
My second daughter is pregnant.

334
00:14:35,639 --> 00:14:37,599
My daughter-in-law is also pregnant.

335
00:14:37,670 --> 00:14:38,999
Shouldn't I give them red packets?

336
00:14:38,999 --> 00:14:39,920
Of course.

337
00:14:39,920 --> 00:14:40,999
You are blessed.

338
00:14:40,999 --> 00:14:42,119
Three grandchildren at once.

339
00:14:42,680 --> 00:14:44,639
This is a good bike.

340
00:14:44,660 --> 00:14:45,920
I won't even trade it for a BMW.

341
00:14:47,119 --> 00:14:49,800
A bike is not as good as babies.

342
00:14:50,080 --> 00:14:50,759
Right?

343
00:14:51,040 --> 00:14:54,040
Three babies mean three red packets.

344
00:14:54,510 --> 00:14:56,719
Every Chinese New Year,
it's three red packets as well.

345
00:14:56,999 --> 00:14:59,400
It's also three red packets
on their birthdays.

346
00:14:59,879 --> 00:15:00,879
Enough talk.

347
00:15:00,960 --> 00:15:02,040
Name your price.

348
00:15:02,639 --> 00:15:04,239
Sure.

349
00:15:05,040 --> 00:15:07,160
Your bike is great.

350
00:15:07,160 --> 00:15:07,719
It's amazing.

351
00:15:08,960 --> 00:15:11,119
However, it's a ten-year-old car.

352
00:15:11,119 --> 00:15:12,440
It's an old car.

353
00:15:12,879 --> 00:15:14,160
I won't fool you.

354
00:15:14,160 --> 00:15:15,200
I'll give you my price.

355
00:15:15,479 --> 00:15:16,400
It's an honest one.

356
00:15:17,239 --> 00:15:17,920
This much.

357
00:15:21,680 --> 00:15:23,479
Are you trying to cause trouble?

358
00:15:23,560 --> 00:15:24,560
Not at all.

359
00:15:24,920 --> 00:15:26,280
Why don't you give me a price?

360
00:15:26,280 --> 00:15:27,320
How can I name my price?

361
00:15:28,999 --> 00:15:29,800
When I'm not selling,

362
00:15:29,879 --> 00:15:32,560
you're praising this bike.

363
00:15:32,920 --> 00:15:35,920
Now that I'm selling, you're only giving value
to the plate alone.

364
00:15:36,280 --> 00:15:37,680
Isn't that causing trouble?

365
00:15:37,839 --> 00:15:38,920
No, Sir. Look.

366
00:15:38,920 --> 00:15:39,719
Think it through.

367
00:15:39,719 --> 00:15:40,839
Move.

368
00:15:41,800 --> 00:15:42,920
Reconsider it.

369
00:15:44,879 --> 00:15:45,960
Think about it!

370
00:15:47,239 --> 00:15:48,239
He's quite stubborn.

371
00:15:54,510 --> 00:15:55,639
Why are you carrying things?

372
00:15:55,639 --> 00:15:56,359
It's fine, Mom.

373
00:15:56,359 --> 00:15:57,160
Put it down. No.

374
00:15:57,359 --> 00:15:59,519
It's the mid-term now.
The most stable period.

375
00:15:59,519 --> 00:16:00,879
You can't do it no matter when.

376
00:16:01,400 --> 00:16:02,119
Don't hit it.

377
00:16:02,119 --> 00:16:02,999
Mingzhu, stop working.

378
00:16:02,999 --> 00:16:03,719
I'll do it later.

379
00:16:03,719 --> 00:16:04,680
Let me do it.

380
00:16:04,680 --> 00:16:05,119
Sure.

381
00:16:05,639 --> 00:16:07,479
The bed is here.

382
00:16:07,479 --> 00:16:08,359
Move.

383
00:16:09,200 --> 00:16:09,879
Go inside first.

384
00:16:09,879 --> 00:16:10,479
Mingzhu.

385
00:16:11,040 --> 00:16:11,759
Be careful.

386
00:16:11,759 --> 00:16:12,080
All right.

387
00:16:12,080 --> 00:16:13,400
This way? Let me go inside first.

388
00:16:13,479 --> 00:16:14,400
Yes. Do it slowly.

389
00:16:14,400 --> 00:16:15,839
Give us some space.

390
00:16:15,839 --> 00:16:16,560
Sure.

391
00:16:16,920 --> 00:16:17,960
We don't want to hit you.

392
00:16:17,960 --> 00:16:18,680
I'll go out.

393
00:16:18,759 --> 00:16:19,800
Sir, carry it higher.

394
00:16:20,200 --> 00:16:21,239
Sure.

395
00:16:21,239 --> 00:16:21,759
Come.

396
00:16:25,239 --> 00:16:27,239
If you put the single bed here.

397
00:16:27,239 --> 00:16:28,920
What about the crib?

398
00:16:29,719 --> 00:16:30,599
Why don't we

399
00:16:30,839 --> 00:16:31,960
put this in my room?

400
00:16:31,960 --> 00:16:32,680
Let me do it.

401
00:16:33,759 --> 00:16:35,479
I can do it. Don't move.

402
00:16:35,479 --> 00:16:37,040
- It's all right.
- Let me do it.

403
00:16:37,040 --> 00:16:37,719
Let me do it.

404
00:16:37,719 --> 00:16:38,359
Together.

405
00:16:38,359 --> 00:16:39,800
One, two, three.

406
00:16:39,800 --> 00:16:40,160
Okay.

407
00:16:40,160 --> 00:16:41,200
Slowly.

408
00:16:41,479 --> 00:16:41,920
Don't move.

409
00:16:41,920 --> 00:16:42,400
Be careful.

410
00:16:42,400 --> 00:16:43,359
- It's all right.
- Okay.

411
00:16:43,359 --> 00:16:43,920
Mind your feet.

412
00:16:43,920 --> 00:16:45,479
You can push it from here.

413
00:16:45,599 --> 00:16:46,320
Mind the step.

414
00:16:46,320 --> 00:16:46,920
Okay.

415
00:16:46,930 --> 00:16:47,585
It has wheels at the bottom.

416
00:16:47,599 --> 00:16:48,160
Sure.

417
00:16:48,599 --> 00:16:49,119
Okay.

418
00:16:49,479 --> 00:16:50,239
Let's push it.

419
00:16:50,239 --> 00:16:50,759
Let's go.

420
00:16:52,239 --> 00:16:53,280
Where should I put it?

421
00:16:53,280 --> 00:16:54,359
By the window.

422
00:16:54,920 --> 00:16:55,440
Come on.

423
00:17:01,080 --> 00:17:01,750
How's this place?

424
00:17:01,920 --> 00:17:02,759
Sure. This is good.

425
00:17:05,239 --> 00:17:06,239
It's heavy.

426
00:17:08,079 --> 00:17:08,680
Hu Gang.

427
00:17:10,120 --> 00:17:10,920
Thank you.

428
00:17:11,239 --> 00:17:11,960
You're welcome.

429
00:17:13,319 --> 00:17:13,999
Will Ni be upset

430
00:17:14,759 --> 00:17:16,279
about you coming here?

431
00:17:17,200 --> 00:17:18,950
She was the one
who asked me to come here.

432
00:17:19,479 --> 00:17:21,440
Ni asked me to tell you you're welcome.

433
00:17:25,279 --> 00:17:25,960
Thankfully,

434
00:17:26,840 --> 00:17:28,200
we are not together.

435
00:17:30,079 --> 00:17:31,200
Don't say that.

436
00:17:31,840 --> 00:17:32,680
What do you mean?

437
00:17:34,840 --> 00:17:35,960
I mean

438
00:17:35,960 --> 00:17:38,440
what you said just now was right.

439
00:17:44,400 --> 00:17:45,160
It's quite good.

440
00:17:49,559 --> 00:17:50,200
This house

441
00:17:51,279 --> 00:17:52,239
is now

442
00:17:53,840 --> 00:17:55,039
so cramped.

443
00:17:56,479 --> 00:17:57,640
Think about it in a good way.

444
00:17:57,999 --> 00:17:59,519
At least, we've protected this house.

445
00:18:01,719 --> 00:18:02,840
It's all because of you.

446
00:18:03,239 --> 00:18:04,559
If you didn't fight for this house

447
00:18:04,660 --> 00:18:05,880
at the price of being scolded,

448
00:18:05,880 --> 00:18:07,920
both of them
will have to stay under a bridge.

449
00:18:08,479 --> 00:18:09,960
She's not satisfied

450
00:18:09,960 --> 00:18:10,519
with gossiping

451
00:18:10,519 --> 00:18:11,680
and she's also complaining.

452
00:18:11,840 --> 00:18:12,799
Last time,

453
00:18:13,279 --> 00:18:15,079
she even blamed us for his son's death.

454
00:18:15,079 --> 00:18:17,039
If she hadn't driven the car away...

455
00:18:17,039 --> 00:18:19,200
- How could she blame us?
- Enough.

456
00:18:19,479 --> 00:18:21,079
Look how pretentious she is.

457
00:18:22,235 --> 00:18:23,640
She ruins a good family.

458
00:18:23,640 --> 00:18:25,400
Why are you talking about this?

459
00:18:26,200 --> 00:18:29,239
They might have a camera in the curtain
that records everything you say.

460
00:18:30,279 --> 00:18:31,759
No. I'm just angry.

461
00:18:31,759 --> 00:18:34,039
Her attitude that day...

462
00:18:34,519 --> 00:18:35,079
Mingzhu.

463
00:18:35,759 --> 00:18:36,479
Do you remember

464
00:18:36,479 --> 00:18:38,200
the story I told you last time?

465
00:18:38,519 --> 00:18:39,319
What story?

466
00:18:39,320 --> 00:18:41,450
The story about
releasing the Ginseng Lady three times.

467
00:18:41,559 --> 00:18:43,799
Nagua caught the Ginseng Lady

468
00:18:43,799 --> 00:18:44,960
and kept releasing her

469
00:18:44,960 --> 00:18:46,319
time after time.

470
00:18:47,200 --> 00:18:50,559
Your grandfather says you're foolish.

471
00:18:50,920 --> 00:18:52,319
He said you were

472
00:18:52,559 --> 00:18:54,360
a happy-go-lucky,

473
00:18:54,360 --> 00:18:56,279
fussy and naggy,

474
00:18:56,279 --> 00:18:57,920
and heartless...

475
00:18:58,200 --> 00:18:59,920
Big fool.

476
00:19:00,835 --> 00:19:02,115
Don't you know what time it is?

477
00:19:03,039 --> 00:19:04,519
How can you still joke?

478
00:19:06,719 --> 00:19:07,319
Mingzhu.

479
00:19:09,680 --> 00:19:10,920
You are right to do this.

480
00:19:11,920 --> 00:19:13,840
You are a pillar of this family now.

481
00:19:14,920 --> 00:19:16,279
If you can't endure it one day,

482
00:19:17,479 --> 00:19:18,279
just come home.

483
00:19:19,519 --> 00:19:21,160
We'll always have a bed for you at home.

484
00:19:24,160 --> 00:19:25,559
You still have your foolish parents.

485
00:19:31,799 --> 00:19:32,519
Sam,

486
00:19:32,519 --> 00:19:33,920
the public account has been banned.

487
00:19:34,079 --> 00:19:35,680
It takes time to appeal.

488
00:19:35,680 --> 00:19:36,999
I have no idea as well.

489
00:19:36,999 --> 00:19:38,479
I'm also in despair.

490
00:19:38,479 --> 00:19:40,319
Let's not be anxious.

491
00:19:40,559 --> 00:19:42,519
I understand you.

492
00:19:42,840 --> 00:19:45,079
However, we only see data.

493
00:19:45,840 --> 00:19:47,319
Look. We had a promise

494
00:19:47,319 --> 00:19:49,519
for you
to give us three articles a month.

495
00:19:49,600 --> 00:19:51,079
However, you only wrote two

496
00:19:51,259 --> 00:19:53,079
so the system deemed it
a contract violation.

497
00:19:53,210 --> 00:19:55,252
You can't reason with a machine.

498
00:19:55,440 --> 00:19:56,039
No,

499
00:19:56,039 --> 00:19:57,640
machines are controlled by humans.

500
00:19:57,640 --> 00:19:59,319
We cannot be controlled by humans.

501
00:19:59,319 --> 00:20:00,400
You are right.

502
00:20:00,400 --> 00:20:01,799
We call this smart system internally

503
00:20:01,799 --> 00:20:03,680
as the Foolish system.

504
00:20:06,440 --> 00:20:08,440
Our boss spent a lot of money

505
00:20:08,440 --> 00:20:09,840
to import it from abroad.

506
00:20:10,319 --> 00:20:11,239
If you oppose it,

507
00:20:11,519 --> 00:20:13,160
you're indirectly opposing our boss.

508
00:20:13,400 --> 00:20:15,519
So, we must firmly protect it.

509
00:20:16,759 --> 00:20:17,960
We also named it

510
00:20:18,319 --> 00:20:19,279
Big Smart.

511
00:20:21,999 --> 00:20:22,719
Sam,

512
00:20:22,999 --> 00:20:24,999
don't you have any way
to help me at all?

513
00:20:24,999 --> 00:20:25,640
Miss,

514
00:20:26,079 --> 00:20:27,559
there's no way.

515
00:20:27,960 --> 00:20:29,700
We must do things
according to the contract.

516
00:20:32,440 --> 00:20:34,440
So, I can't pay you

517
00:20:35,799 --> 00:20:36,840
this month's promotion fee.

518
00:20:43,360 --> 00:20:45,360
Zhixia, you should get back to work.

519
00:20:45,600 --> 00:20:46,799
I have a meeting later.

520
00:21:05,160 --> 00:21:05,680
Hello.

521
00:21:06,239 --> 00:21:06,960
Hello, Zhixia.

522
00:21:07,319 --> 00:21:08,279
Are you free tonight?

523
00:21:08,360 --> 00:21:09,880
Chen and I want to treat you to dinner.

524
00:21:12,079 --> 00:21:15,239
Am I free or not?

525
00:21:17,719 --> 00:21:18,400
I guess I'm free.

526
00:21:21,519 --> 00:21:23,680
Mr. Xu, it's rare for you to treat me.

527
00:21:24,200 --> 00:21:25,479
Should I order politely

528
00:21:25,479 --> 00:21:26,999
or order as I wish?

529
00:21:27,279 --> 00:21:28,160
Don't worry.

530
00:21:28,559 --> 00:21:29,680
I've arranged everything.

531
00:21:32,680 --> 00:21:34,079
Here's your three-person set.

532
00:21:40,400 --> 00:21:41,160
Set?

533
00:21:42,319 --> 00:21:43,999
Four dishes and a soup.

534
00:21:44,559 --> 00:21:45,319
It's the standard.

535
00:21:46,519 --> 00:21:47,799
Xu Zhidong made a bulk purchase.

536
00:21:48,079 --> 00:21:49,160
118 yuan.

537
00:21:52,759 --> 00:21:53,479
Bichen.

538
00:21:54,479 --> 00:21:55,960
Before you two got married,

539
00:21:55,960 --> 00:21:57,079
I was shy to ask.

540
00:21:57,840 --> 00:21:59,640
Now that both of you are married,

541
00:21:59,999 --> 00:22:01,640
I'll ask you bravely

542
00:22:01,640 --> 00:22:03,400
why you fall for Xu Zhidong.

543
00:22:03,400 --> 00:22:04,999
He knows how to live a life.

544
00:22:05,200 --> 00:22:06,559
How is this living life?

545
00:22:06,559 --> 00:22:07,559
He's just stingy.

546
00:22:08,840 --> 00:22:09,840
Young people

547
00:22:10,079 --> 00:22:11,640
are all lovestruck.

548
00:22:13,960 --> 00:22:15,390
The dipping sauce contains ginger.

549
00:22:15,400 --> 00:22:16,079
Waitress.

550
00:22:16,600 --> 00:22:18,400
Give me a dipping sauce without ginger.

551
00:22:18,400 --> 00:22:18,999
Sure.

552
00:22:19,759 --> 00:22:20,840
Xu Zhidong,

553
00:22:20,840 --> 00:22:21,680
you've never

554
00:22:21,680 --> 00:22:24,039
treated Mom and me so considerately.

555
00:22:24,039 --> 00:22:25,880
You shouldn't cause trouble like this.

556
00:22:26,319 --> 00:22:27,999
I... How am I not being considerate?

557
00:22:28,479 --> 00:22:28,960
Then...

558
00:22:29,479 --> 00:22:30,680
When you argued with Zhang Hao,

559
00:22:30,680 --> 00:22:32,440
weren't I firmly supporting you

560
00:22:32,440 --> 00:22:33,640
every time?

561
00:22:34,120 --> 00:22:35,039
What do you mean?

562
00:22:35,039 --> 00:22:36,950
Were you supposed to
support Zhang Hao instead?

563
00:22:36,999 --> 00:22:38,279
Are you Zhang Hao's sibling?

564
00:22:38,279 --> 00:22:39,999
Adults are too emotional.

565
00:22:39,999 --> 00:22:41,279
Don't argue with Zhixia.

566
00:22:41,279 --> 00:22:41,999
I'm not arguing.

567
00:22:41,999 --> 00:22:43,039
I won't do it.

568
00:22:43,920 --> 00:22:46,160
Zhixia, I have something important
to discuss with you.

569
00:22:46,279 --> 00:22:49,479
You treat me to a 118-yuan bulk purchase
meal to discuss something important?

570
00:22:50,880 --> 00:22:51,600
Bichen,

571
00:22:51,960 --> 00:22:52,999
was he so stingy

572
00:22:52,999 --> 00:22:54,160
when both of you were dating?

573
00:22:54,360 --> 00:22:56,200
What's so bad about a stingy man?

574
00:22:56,360 --> 00:22:57,680
He won't cheat on me.

575
00:22:57,680 --> 00:22:58,200
Yes.

576
00:22:58,200 --> 00:23:00,039
I didn't spend the money I saved.

577
00:23:00,039 --> 00:23:01,559
I give every cent to her.

578
00:23:01,799 --> 00:23:03,840
Yes. Zhang Hao is the same.

579
00:23:04,400 --> 00:23:05,559
Let's talk business.

580
00:23:07,440 --> 00:23:08,079
I heard Dad say

581
00:23:08,079 --> 00:23:09,640
he was going to sell his motorcycle

582
00:23:09,640 --> 00:23:10,719
to help Mingzhu.

583
00:23:11,690 --> 00:23:12,719
Is he willing to do that?

584
00:23:12,719 --> 00:23:14,160
Of course, not.

585
00:23:14,600 --> 00:23:15,999
So, I was thinking...

586
00:23:17,759 --> 00:23:19,200
So, you are thinking

587
00:23:20,680 --> 00:23:22,880
about asking me to buy Dad's motorcycle

588
00:23:23,640 --> 00:23:24,519
and use the money

589
00:23:24,519 --> 00:23:26,799
to give Mingzhu
while returning the motorcycle to Dad?

590
00:23:28,440 --> 00:23:29,519
Exactly.

591
00:23:30,260 --> 00:23:31,559
What is your role in all of this?

592
00:23:32,759 --> 00:23:34,160
Think about the idea, that's all?

593
00:23:34,880 --> 00:23:35,640
Or treating me

594
00:23:35,640 --> 00:23:37,079
to a 118-yuan bulk purchase meal?

595
00:23:37,079 --> 00:23:38,740
This meal is too expensive.
I can't afford to eat it.

596
00:23:38,759 --> 00:23:39,519
Zhixia,

597
00:23:39,519 --> 00:23:40,440
don't be angry.

598
00:23:40,640 --> 00:23:42,600
Zhidong was just joking.

599
00:23:43,719 --> 00:23:44,440
We came here

600
00:23:44,440 --> 00:23:47,999
to discuss with you that each family
will give 20,000 yuan to Dad.

601
00:23:47,999 --> 00:23:49,960
Think of it as a gift for him.

602
00:23:54,719 --> 00:23:55,519
Not bad.

603
00:23:56,960 --> 00:23:58,160
You act like a man now.

604
00:23:59,319 --> 00:24:00,160
Bichen,

605
00:24:00,680 --> 00:24:01,319
it's true.

606
00:24:02,079 --> 00:24:03,640
Since marrying you,

607
00:24:03,999 --> 00:24:05,400
Xu Zhidong has been a sensible man.

608
00:24:06,079 --> 00:24:07,519
Your education works.

609
00:24:07,960 --> 00:24:08,880
The credit's all mine.

610
00:24:11,759 --> 00:24:12,360
Fine.

611
00:24:13,400 --> 00:24:14,319
I agree.

612
00:24:15,640 --> 00:24:18,880
Can I order another portion of potato
slices after contributing 20,000 yuan,

613
00:24:18,880 --> 00:24:19,479
Mr. Xu.

614
00:24:19,479 --> 00:24:21,840
Waitress, get me another portion
of potato slices.

615
00:24:28,360 --> 00:24:29,360
Mom, you're back.

616
00:24:33,039 --> 00:24:35,479
It seems like you are studying.

617
00:24:37,400 --> 00:24:38,440
You are very self-aware.

618
00:24:38,640 --> 00:24:39,519
Let me praise you.

619
00:24:39,799 --> 00:24:41,960
Studying makes my mom happy.

620
00:24:45,960 --> 00:24:47,740
Have you settled
the public account incident?

621
00:24:48,079 --> 00:24:49,120
Not yet. Don't mention it.

622
00:24:49,120 --> 00:24:50,719
This annoys me.

623
00:24:51,060 --> 00:24:52,239
I won't mention it anymore.

624
00:24:53,120 --> 00:24:54,550
Being happy is the most important.

625
00:24:55,730 --> 00:24:57,239
Didn't your younger brother treat you?

626
00:24:57,239 --> 00:24:58,039
What did you eat?

627
00:24:58,519 --> 00:24:59,160
A feast.

628
00:25:00,479 --> 00:25:01,239
Bulk purchase.

629
00:25:01,519 --> 00:25:03,279
118 yuan for four dishes and one soup.

630
00:25:03,600 --> 00:25:04,719
He's more stingy than I am.

631
00:25:04,719 --> 00:25:06,500
It matches
your younger brother's character.

632
00:25:07,759 --> 00:25:08,999
You don't say.

633
00:25:09,840 --> 00:25:11,519
After Xu Zhidong was married,

634
00:25:11,799 --> 00:25:13,200
he became very sensible.

635
00:25:13,840 --> 00:25:15,160
He told me

636
00:25:15,440 --> 00:25:17,440
he wanted to pool up money
to help Mingzhu.

637
00:25:20,360 --> 00:25:22,039
I notice marriage really changes

638
00:25:22,039 --> 00:25:23,400
a person's fate.

639
00:25:23,960 --> 00:25:25,920
You and your mom
worked hard for 20 years

640
00:25:25,920 --> 00:25:28,120
and still failed
to change your younger brother.

641
00:25:28,479 --> 00:25:29,719
When Yuan Bichen came along,

642
00:25:29,719 --> 00:25:31,400
she changed him completely.

643
00:25:33,680 --> 00:25:35,519
I should also learn from Bichen

644
00:25:35,519 --> 00:25:37,200
and change you.

645
00:25:37,200 --> 00:25:38,400
Do I need to be changed?

646
00:25:38,799 --> 00:25:40,120
I'm improving myself.

647
00:25:40,120 --> 00:25:40,719
See?

648
00:25:41,239 --> 00:25:41,999
A speech.

649
00:25:42,719 --> 00:25:44,319
Respected Nanzhou...

650
00:25:48,640 --> 00:25:50,079
I'll praise you as well.

651
00:25:52,759 --> 00:25:54,960
It's safe now that I'm in my mid-term.

652
00:25:57,360 --> 00:25:58,360
Go and take a bath.

653
00:26:01,039 --> 00:26:02,479
It's embarrassing to say that.

654
00:26:06,759 --> 00:26:07,400
Jiao.

655
00:26:07,480 --> 00:26:09,150
Forget it
if you can't finish your homework.

656
00:26:09,279 --> 00:26:10,120
Get ready to sleep.

657
00:26:10,600 --> 00:26:11,279
Right now?

658
00:26:11,680 --> 00:26:12,890
You must combine work and rest.

659
00:26:16,170 --> 00:26:17,750
It's almost time for the Chinese New Year.

660
00:26:24,479 --> 00:26:25,120
Ribs.

661
00:26:25,400 --> 00:26:25,999
Mom.

662
00:26:26,400 --> 00:26:27,079
It's done?

663
00:26:27,079 --> 00:26:27,640
Give it to me.

664
00:26:27,840 --> 00:26:29,680
No. Sit down.

665
00:26:29,920 --> 00:26:31,279
Sit down.

666
00:26:37,600 --> 00:26:39,880
I've not cooked for a long time.

667
00:26:39,880 --> 00:26:41,519
I wonder how my cooking is.

668
00:26:41,519 --> 00:26:43,360
Just make do with whatever I made.

669
00:26:43,360 --> 00:26:43,920
Mom,

670
00:26:43,920 --> 00:26:45,479
they look delicious.

671
00:26:49,120 --> 00:26:50,840
Mingzhu. Meiqi.

672
00:26:51,559 --> 00:26:53,799
I've always

673
00:26:54,440 --> 00:26:55,640
made complaints

674
00:26:55,640 --> 00:26:57,400
when I encounter problems.

675
00:26:57,680 --> 00:26:58,880
I always say the wrong thing

676
00:26:58,880 --> 00:27:00,479
and I'm sure I've hurt both of you.

677
00:27:00,759 --> 00:27:03,519
Allow me to apologize to you two today.

678
00:27:03,559 --> 00:27:04,400
Sorry.

679
00:27:04,479 --> 00:27:05,039
Mom,

680
00:27:05,039 --> 00:27:06,160
we are a family.

681
00:27:06,319 --> 00:27:07,519
Don't say that.

682
00:27:08,039 --> 00:27:10,400
Mingzhu and I have never blamed you.

683
00:27:10,400 --> 00:27:11,960
I know that.

684
00:27:11,960 --> 00:27:12,719
I know.

685
00:27:12,719 --> 00:27:14,920
Both of you are my good daughters.

686
00:27:16,239 --> 00:27:17,400
Eat.

687
00:27:18,640 --> 00:27:19,440
We...

688
00:27:24,319 --> 00:27:25,479
From tomorrow onward,

689
00:27:25,479 --> 00:27:27,519
this is no longer our home.

690
00:27:27,920 --> 00:27:29,120
But we must

691
00:27:29,719 --> 00:27:30,719
have a nice meal

692
00:27:30,719 --> 00:27:32,279
at this place tonight

693
00:27:35,039 --> 00:27:38,160
so Dad and Jianqi can feel relieved.

694
00:27:39,239 --> 00:27:40,079
Let's eat.

695
00:27:42,680 --> 00:27:43,960
Who is it at this time?

696
00:27:44,970 --> 00:27:46,640
Do you think
it's someone from the court?

697
00:27:47,279 --> 00:27:48,239
Let me take a look.

698
00:27:48,880 --> 00:27:49,680
Be careful.

699
00:28:04,400 --> 00:28:05,200
Both of you are...

700
00:28:22,120 --> 00:28:23,279
This is Feng's son.

701
00:28:34,079 --> 00:28:34,920
That's impossible!

702
00:28:40,700 --> 00:28:42,140
(Medical Certificate of Birth)

703
00:28:52,900 --> 00:28:54,780
(Medical Certificate of Birth)

704
00:28:56,580 --> 00:28:59,980
(Medical Certificate of Birth)

705
00:29:07,079 --> 00:29:07,799
That's impossible.

706
00:29:08,920 --> 00:29:11,680
My dad will never have a son outside.

707
00:29:11,680 --> 00:29:14,640
You must be here to cause trouble.
Get out!

708
00:29:16,559 --> 00:29:17,880
You are being rude.

709
00:29:19,039 --> 00:29:21,079
I remember Feng used to tell me

710
00:29:21,640 --> 00:29:22,999
that his daughter was outstanding.

711
00:29:22,999 --> 00:29:23,920
Shut up!

712
00:29:23,999 --> 00:29:24,960
Meiqi.

713
00:29:29,840 --> 00:29:30,519
Mingzhu,

714
00:29:32,239 --> 00:29:35,519
bring Meiqi and the child outside.

715
00:29:36,120 --> 00:29:36,759
Mom.

716
00:29:40,640 --> 00:29:41,360
Go.

717
00:29:42,719 --> 00:29:43,400
Qi,

718
00:29:43,920 --> 00:29:45,799
go out and play with your sister.

719
00:29:46,559 --> 00:29:47,360
Go.

720
00:29:53,479 --> 00:29:54,079
Let's go.

721
00:30:01,640 --> 00:30:02,319
Sit.

722
00:30:17,759 --> 00:30:18,799
Hello, Mrs. Feng.

723
00:30:19,440 --> 00:30:20,400
I am Ding Hong.

724
00:30:21,400 --> 00:30:22,719
I won't beat around the bush.

725
00:30:23,640 --> 00:30:24,680
I came here

726
00:30:24,680 --> 00:30:25,719
to tell you

727
00:30:26,360 --> 00:30:27,479
that we should have a part

728
00:30:28,079 --> 00:30:29,160
of Feng's inheritance.

729
00:30:31,440 --> 00:30:32,440
Feng is dead.

730
00:30:33,999 --> 00:30:35,759
He left nothing behind

731
00:30:35,999 --> 00:30:37,160
besides his debt.

732
00:30:38,799 --> 00:30:41,319
The court will take this house tomorrow.

733
00:30:48,200 --> 00:30:49,759
A family like ours.

734
00:30:50,079 --> 00:30:52,319
With Feng doing business outside
all the time,

735
00:30:53,400 --> 00:30:54,799
besides you, Ding Hong,

736
00:30:54,799 --> 00:30:57,840
there might also be a Li Hong,
Wang Hong, or Cai Hong.

737
00:30:59,519 --> 00:31:00,440
Which mistress are you?

738
00:31:01,920 --> 00:31:02,600
The third?

739
00:31:04,239 --> 00:31:06,400
The fourth, fifth, or sixth?

740
00:31:06,680 --> 00:31:08,239
Mrs. Feng, you are pitiful.

741
00:31:08,960 --> 00:31:10,479
Are you used to being cheated on?

742
00:31:12,680 --> 00:31:13,360
It's normal.

743
00:31:13,920 --> 00:31:14,719
What do you think?

744
00:31:16,719 --> 00:31:17,640
It's fine.

745
00:31:18,640 --> 00:31:20,600
I'm sure you are very angry

746
00:31:20,759 --> 00:31:21,719
and sad.

747
00:31:21,960 --> 00:31:22,920
I understand.

748
00:31:23,640 --> 00:31:24,519
I don't mind

749
00:31:24,519 --> 00:31:25,719
no matter what you say.

750
00:31:26,479 --> 00:31:28,319
Later, we will go
through legal proceedings

751
00:31:28,319 --> 00:31:29,440
if need be.

752
00:31:30,360 --> 00:31:31,279
For the child,

753
00:31:31,999 --> 00:31:34,160
I will definitely
fight for Feng's inheritance.

754
00:31:34,160 --> 00:31:34,719
Go ahead.

755
00:31:37,680 --> 00:31:38,999
You can also investigate

756
00:31:39,960 --> 00:31:40,680
and see

757
00:31:41,640 --> 00:31:43,400
what inheritance Feng has

758
00:31:43,759 --> 00:31:45,200
for you to fight for.

759
00:31:48,759 --> 00:31:49,880
Feng is dead.

760
00:31:52,559 --> 00:31:54,039
How many women and children

761
00:31:54,039 --> 00:31:55,519
he had out there

762
00:31:56,600 --> 00:31:58,279
is none of our business.

763
00:32:00,120 --> 00:32:01,079
You are still young.

764
00:32:01,680 --> 00:32:04,719
Live a good life with your child
in the future.

765
00:32:09,200 --> 00:32:10,279
Did Feng

766
00:32:13,600 --> 00:32:15,120
give you this bracelet?

767
00:32:20,680 --> 00:32:21,400
It's fake.

768
00:32:25,920 --> 00:32:29,239
There's only one bracelet
in the Feng family.

769
00:32:30,200 --> 00:32:31,759
My mother-in-law gave it to me

770
00:32:32,680 --> 00:32:35,239
and I gave it
to my daughter-in-law, Shen Mingzhu.

771
00:32:37,719 --> 00:32:39,319
You are young after all.

772
00:32:40,160 --> 00:32:42,680
You gave birth to a son
without getting married.

773
00:32:44,319 --> 00:32:45,559
How gullible.

774
00:32:51,440 --> 00:32:52,559
That's not necessary.

775
00:33:17,279 --> 00:33:18,120
Qi, let's go.

776
00:33:34,400 --> 00:33:35,039
Meiqi,

777
00:33:35,239 --> 00:33:36,360
this soup is delicious.

778
00:33:36,840 --> 00:33:37,400
Come.

779
00:33:45,319 --> 00:33:46,079
Wait!

780
00:33:53,610 --> 00:33:54,719
Is your mother-in-law fine?

781
00:33:54,880 --> 00:33:56,519
I rushed out to tell you

782
00:33:56,660 --> 00:33:59,160
that not only did my father-in-law
not leave any assets behind,

783
00:33:59,160 --> 00:34:00,559
but he even has a lot of debt.

784
00:34:01,279 --> 00:34:02,840
If you had come a day later,

785
00:34:03,200 --> 00:34:03,960
you'd see

786
00:34:03,960 --> 00:34:05,519
the court's seal on the door.

787
00:34:06,799 --> 00:34:07,479
Is that so?

788
00:34:07,480 --> 00:34:09,260
I'm sure you haven't gone
to the factory yet.

789
00:34:10,240 --> 00:34:12,199
If you don't believe me,
go to the factory

790
00:34:12,199 --> 00:34:13,199
and you'll understand.

791
00:34:14,639 --> 00:34:16,170
Since he didn't leave anything behind,

792
00:34:17,440 --> 00:34:19,039
let's not keep in touch.

793
00:34:20,400 --> 00:34:21,800
Otherwise, everyone will be sad.

794
00:34:33,840 --> 00:34:34,400
Mom.

795
00:34:36,320 --> 00:34:37,119
Don't worry.

796
00:34:37,840 --> 00:34:39,679
I don't think they will come again.

797
00:34:41,360 --> 00:34:42,039
It's fine.

798
00:34:42,679 --> 00:34:44,280
Eat. Hurry.

799
00:34:45,400 --> 00:34:46,400
Eat.

800
00:34:48,079 --> 00:34:48,720
Meiqi,

801
00:34:49,360 --> 00:34:50,079
eat.

802
00:34:50,720 --> 00:34:51,880
I wonder

803
00:34:51,880 --> 00:34:53,760
how my cooking is now.

804
00:34:57,760 --> 00:34:59,920
It's very salty.

805
00:35:00,260 --> 00:35:01,750
Let me tell you something about Meiqi.

806
00:35:02,920 --> 00:35:03,800
When we first

807
00:35:04,400 --> 00:35:06,159
bought this house,

808
00:35:06,999 --> 00:35:08,039
you were abroad.

809
00:35:08,320 --> 00:35:09,360
You were so much trouble.

810
00:35:10,039 --> 00:35:11,599
You sent me pictures every day

811
00:35:11,720 --> 00:35:15,159
and said you wanted the room to be pink

812
00:35:15,440 --> 00:35:16,400
and the blankets

813
00:35:16,400 --> 00:35:17,920
must be the same as the wall.

814
00:35:17,920 --> 00:35:19,079
You were so much trouble.

815
00:35:20,479 --> 00:35:21,360
Let me tell you.

816
00:35:21,840 --> 00:35:23,599
Your dad loves you a lot.

817
00:35:23,920 --> 00:35:24,639
It's true.

818
00:35:25,010 --> 00:35:26,400
He didn't sleep during the afternoon

819
00:35:26,400 --> 00:35:27,840
and insisted on going
to the building materials shop with me

820
00:35:27,840 --> 00:35:29,400
because my aesthetic is bad.

821
00:35:30,280 --> 00:35:31,479
Is my aesthetic sense bad?

822
00:35:32,320 --> 00:35:33,360
I am He Lihua.

823
00:35:33,360 --> 00:35:34,599
How can my sense be bad?

824
00:35:34,599 --> 00:35:35,519
Seriously.

825
00:35:36,360 --> 00:35:38,360
However, your dad really loves you.

826
00:35:38,880 --> 00:35:39,920
Also, Mingzhu,

827
00:35:40,519 --> 00:35:43,079
do you know that crib?

828
00:35:43,360 --> 00:35:44,519
The baby's crib?

829
00:35:45,240 --> 00:35:46,599
He was old

830
00:35:46,599 --> 00:35:48,240
but he carried it back himself.

831
00:35:48,240 --> 00:35:50,039
I didn't expect that.

832
00:35:53,400 --> 00:35:54,039
That's right.

833
00:35:54,519 --> 00:35:55,400
The bracelet

834
00:35:56,119 --> 00:35:58,280
is a family heirloom of the Feng family.

835
00:35:58,280 --> 00:36:00,039
You must wear it.

836
00:36:00,159 --> 00:36:01,079
It protects you.

837
00:36:01,800 --> 00:36:02,320
All right.

838
00:36:04,679 --> 00:36:07,039
This is quite good.

839
00:36:08,800 --> 00:36:10,400
I... I think...

840
00:36:11,920 --> 00:36:13,240
In the past, I thought

841
00:36:13,240 --> 00:36:15,440
life was long

842
00:36:16,039 --> 00:36:17,599
and there was a lot of time.

843
00:36:18,559 --> 00:36:19,760
I didn't expect

844
00:36:19,760 --> 00:36:22,119
all the time
to pass in the blink of an eye.

845
00:36:25,320 --> 00:36:27,800
I felt all those days I lived

846
00:36:28,599 --> 00:36:30,079
were fake.

847
00:36:31,920 --> 00:36:32,519
Mom,

848
00:36:33,599 --> 00:36:34,240
it's fine.

849
00:36:35,599 --> 00:36:37,519
In the future, we'll live on.

850
00:36:37,519 --> 00:36:39,840
Of course. We must live a good life.

851
00:36:43,920 --> 00:36:45,039
I'm so tired.

852
00:36:48,240 --> 00:36:49,519
I'm so tired.

853
00:36:51,360 --> 00:36:52,039
Both of you, eat.

854
00:36:52,039 --> 00:36:53,559
I want to take a break.

855
00:36:53,559 --> 00:36:54,400
Just a short break.

856
00:36:55,159 --> 00:36:56,920
Eat well.

857
00:36:57,079 --> 00:36:58,320
Mom, let me accompany you.

858
00:36:58,320 --> 00:36:59,720
No.

859
00:37:01,119 --> 00:37:02,240
I'm just taking a break.

860
00:37:03,119 --> 00:37:03,800
It's fine.

861
00:37:22,700 --> 00:37:24,740
(Nanzhou New City Civil Court, Seized)

862
00:37:24,835 --> 00:37:28,835
(Nanzhou Jianmei Workshop)

863
00:37:31,639 --> 00:37:33,559
Mom, I'm very scared.

864
00:37:33,800 --> 00:37:37,639
Mom, I'm very scared.

865
00:37:38,479 --> 00:37:39,119
Don't be scared.

866
00:37:42,199 --> 00:37:43,639
I'm here. Why are you scared?

867
00:37:45,360 --> 00:37:45,999
Let's go.

868
00:38:06,440 --> 00:38:07,079
Mom,

869
00:38:07,800 --> 00:38:08,999
don't sleep here.

870
00:38:09,320 --> 00:38:10,840
Let's go sleep on the bed, all right?

871
00:38:14,999 --> 00:38:15,639
Mom.

872
00:38:17,720 --> 00:38:18,280
Mom.

873
00:38:19,559 --> 00:38:20,240
Mom!

874
00:38:21,240 --> 00:38:21,999
Meiqi!

875
00:38:23,079 --> 00:38:23,720
Mom!

876
00:38:24,999 --> 00:38:25,840
Mom!

877
00:38:26,559 --> 00:38:27,119
Mom.

878
00:38:27,760 --> 00:38:30,800
Mom!

879
00:38:31,479 --> 00:38:33,679
This is bad. Don't touch her. Call 120.

880
00:38:38,220 --> 00:38:39,860
(In Operation)

881
00:38:39,860 --> 00:38:43,140
(Operation Theater)

882
00:38:58,880 --> 00:38:59,840
It'll be fine.

883
00:39:07,360 --> 00:39:08,159
Over here, Dad!

884
00:39:08,720 --> 00:39:09,320
Where?

885
00:39:09,840 --> 00:39:11,199
Slow down.

886
00:39:11,199 --> 00:39:11,840
You are...

887
00:39:12,400 --> 00:39:13,240
Is it here?

888
00:39:13,240 --> 00:39:14,400
Where's the operation?

889
00:39:14,400 --> 00:39:15,039
Mingzhu.

890
00:39:16,800 --> 00:39:17,400
Minghui.

891
00:39:17,999 --> 00:39:18,720
Are you all right?

892
00:39:23,159 --> 00:39:23,479
Mom.

893
00:39:23,479 --> 00:39:23,960
It's fine.

894
00:39:24,060 --> 00:39:24,679
It'll be fine.

895
00:39:24,679 --> 00:39:25,270
Don't be scared.

896
00:39:25,280 --> 00:39:26,599
We are here.

897
00:39:34,599 --> 00:39:35,679
How is it, Doctor?

898
00:39:35,800 --> 00:39:36,880
The operation was a success.

899
00:39:37,060 --> 00:39:38,999
But the patient
is still in a critical condition.

900
00:39:39,079 --> 00:39:40,880
She needs to be observed in the ICU.

901
00:39:40,890 --> 00:39:43,180
I need a family member
to complete the necessary procedures.

902
00:39:43,199 --> 00:39:43,800
I'll go.

903
00:39:44,400 --> 00:39:45,599
Minghui, get my bag for me.

904
00:39:46,280 --> 00:39:46,800
Here you go.

905
00:39:46,880 --> 00:39:48,079
Accompany Mom and Dad for me.

906
00:39:48,079 --> 00:39:48,999
Slow down.

907
00:39:55,119 --> 00:39:56,880
Yes. I am He Lihua's family member.

908
00:39:57,119 --> 00:39:57,800
What is it?

909
00:39:58,800 --> 00:40:00,360
The patient's platelet count is only 19.

910
00:40:00,880 --> 00:40:02,760
We recommend
administering the human albumin.

911
00:40:03,060 --> 00:40:04,119
However, this is self-paid.

912
00:40:04,240 --> 00:40:05,559
How much is it?

913
00:40:07,360 --> 00:40:08,800
Sure. We'll proceed.

914
00:40:09,720 --> 00:40:11,119
Yes. I know we are owing money.

915
00:40:11,119 --> 00:40:12,639
I'm going home to get money.

916
00:40:12,800 --> 00:40:13,880
