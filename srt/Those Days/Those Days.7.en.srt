00:01:15,220 --> 00:01:17,700
=Episode 7=

4
00:01:24,649 --> 00:01:25,330
Excuse me.

5
00:01:25,849 --> 00:01:27,330
Is Dr. Li here?

6
00:01:27,690 --> 00:01:28,409
Yes, he is.

7
00:01:28,970 --> 00:01:30,369
He's in Exam Room 8, right?

8
00:01:30,369 --> 00:01:30,890
Yes.

9
00:01:31,090 --> 00:01:31,810
Thank you.

10
00:01:37,360 --> 00:01:38,120
Please come in.

11
00:01:38,810 --> 00:01:39,569
Dr. Li,

12
00:01:39,648 --> 00:01:40,810
I hope I'm not disturbing you.

13
00:01:41,610 --> 00:01:42,649
No. Come in.

14
00:01:49,009 --> 00:01:50,289
You're eating this for lunch?

15
00:01:50,810 --> 00:01:53,009
I was busy. I didn't have time
to go down for lunch.

16
00:01:53,409 --> 00:01:54,489
Just grabbing a bite.

17
00:01:54,849 --> 00:01:56,649
You can't eat spicy sticks for lunch.

18
00:01:58,769 --> 00:01:59,690
Have this.

19
00:01:59,929 --> 00:02:01,730
My mom packed me a work meal.

20
00:02:01,871 --> 00:02:03,610
I was supposed to be back at the office,

21
00:02:03,610 --> 00:02:05,489
but my superior
made me go home and rest.

22
00:02:05,849 --> 00:02:07,530
I'll eat when I get home.

23
00:02:07,530 --> 00:02:09,249
What kind of great leader is that?

24
00:02:10,209 --> 00:02:11,290
Well, I'll take it.

25
00:02:11,290 --> 00:02:12,089
Go ahead.

26
00:02:14,769 --> 00:02:17,369
I thought your follow-up was next week.

27
00:02:18,130 --> 00:02:19,769
Yeah, next week.

28
00:02:19,769 --> 00:02:20,730
I came today to ask

29
00:02:20,730 --> 00:02:23,515
if you could write me a sick leave note
for interstitial pregnancy.

30
00:02:23,515 --> 00:02:25,093
My superior wants me to take sick leave.

31
00:02:25,137 --> 00:02:26,610
I'm afraid that if someone checks,

32
00:02:26,610 --> 00:02:27,610
he'll get blamed.

33
00:02:27,969 --> 00:02:29,170
I see. I'll write it for you.

34
00:02:29,610 --> 00:02:30,209
Thank you.

35
00:02:37,489 --> 00:02:38,410
They're still warm.

36
00:02:38,850 --> 00:02:39,529
Thank you.

37
00:02:44,893 --> 00:02:46,170
Give this to your company.

38
00:02:46,170 --> 00:02:47,730
Get it stamped at the triage desk.

39
00:02:47,740 --> 00:02:49,950
The procedure is correct,
and it's good for your leader.

40
00:02:50,130 --> 00:02:51,489
You've got experience in this.

41
00:02:51,969 --> 00:02:52,610
Thank you.

42
00:02:52,689 --> 00:02:53,330
Li Jingzhe!

43
00:02:54,249 --> 00:02:54,969
Li Jingzhe!

44
00:02:54,969 --> 00:02:55,890
Come out!

45
00:02:56,249 --> 00:02:57,290
Come out, Li Jingzhe!

46
00:02:58,426 --> 00:02:59,760
He must be hiding in his office.

47
00:02:59,769 --> 00:03:00,440
Definitely here.

48
00:03:00,448 --> 00:03:01,670
­ Who's that?
- Li Jingzhe!

49
00:03:01,760 --> 00:03:02,469
Li Jingzhe!

50
00:03:02,470 --> 00:03:03,050
Hospital brawl.

51
00:03:03,050 --> 00:03:04,640
I'll take you out through the back door.

52
00:03:04,689 --> 00:03:05,529
Li Jingzhe!

53
00:03:07,089 --> 00:03:08,369
There's a back door?

54
00:03:10,960 --> 00:03:12,520
- This is a hospital.
- Don't touch me!

55
00:03:12,529 --> 00:03:13,450
Please calm down, madam.

56
00:03:13,450 --> 00:03:14,890
- The nurse hits me!
- Get off me.

57
00:03:14,890 --> 00:03:15,850
Please calm down.

58
00:03:15,850 --> 00:03:16,369
Li Jingzhe!

59
00:03:16,369 --> 00:03:17,489
Please calm down, madam.

60
00:03:18,337 --> 00:03:19,570
- Where's he?
- Li Jingzhe!

61
00:03:21,182 --> 00:03:22,360
- Li Jingzhe!
- Li Jingzhe!

62
00:03:34,769 --> 00:03:35,570
Are you okay?

63
00:03:36,089 --> 00:03:37,969
Do you guys often run into this?

64
00:03:39,769 --> 00:03:40,570
Not quite.

65
00:03:41,410 --> 00:03:42,330
Last month,

66
00:03:42,330 --> 00:03:44,010
a patient had a placental abruption.

67
00:03:44,330 --> 00:03:45,689
The baby didn't survive.

68
00:03:45,848 --> 00:03:47,026
The family couldn't accept it

69
00:03:47,030 --> 00:03:48,890
and keeps coming back
to make trouble every few days.

70
00:03:48,893 --> 00:03:50,760
I'm one of the few male doctors
in the department,

71
00:03:50,769 --> 00:03:52,089
young and fast enough to run.

72
00:03:52,529 --> 00:03:54,969
So they sent me to handle it.

73
00:03:56,050 --> 00:03:56,850
I see.

74
00:03:58,089 --> 00:03:58,969
Are you really okay?

75
00:04:00,570 --> 00:04:01,170
I'm good.

76
00:04:05,929 --> 00:04:08,529
Right now, I'm doing two things at once.

77
00:04:08,570 --> 00:04:09,610
Saving lives on one hand,

78
00:04:09,610 --> 00:04:11,290
and mapping out the hospital
on the other,

79
00:04:11,290 --> 00:04:13,010
ready to escape anytime.

80
00:04:15,290 --> 00:04:17,290
That hallway leads to the morgue.

81
00:04:17,290 --> 00:04:18,569
Nobody goes there.

82
00:04:18,569 --> 00:04:20,290
I was on the phone there that day.

83
00:04:20,290 --> 00:04:21,610
Didn't expect to run into you.

84
00:04:23,449 --> 00:04:24,889
If it weren't for death stuff,

85
00:04:25,090 --> 00:04:26,329
I wouldn't have gone there.

86
00:04:27,689 --> 00:04:28,569
You know,

87
00:04:28,650 --> 00:04:30,090
that day something occurred to me.

88
00:04:30,809 --> 00:04:33,449
If only my husband had cheated on me.

89
00:04:34,160 --> 00:04:35,320
As long as he was still alive,

90
00:04:35,871 --> 00:04:37,210
everything else wouldn't matter.

91
00:04:42,210 --> 00:04:44,249
What if

92
00:04:44,337 --> 00:04:45,515
he really cheats on you?

93
00:04:49,889 --> 00:04:50,650
I'd wish him well.

94
00:04:55,889 --> 00:04:57,610
That's typical for a mom-to-be.

95
00:04:57,689 --> 00:04:59,329
Your heart is
big enough to float a boat.

96
00:05:01,560 --> 00:05:04,226
Hearts only get that big
because the boat pushes them open.

97
00:05:05,970 --> 00:05:08,170
Every stroke hurts,

98
00:05:08,960 --> 00:05:10,410
but you still have to keep rowing.

99
00:05:15,050 --> 00:05:16,410
Is it hard for you right now?

100
00:05:18,929 --> 00:05:19,689
It's okay.

101
00:05:21,650 --> 00:05:24,090
Do you have someone to talk to
when you're upset?

102
00:05:25,449 --> 00:05:26,210
No one.

103
00:05:35,689 --> 00:05:36,770
Someone dies.

104
00:05:38,329 --> 00:05:39,569
People die every day.

105
00:05:43,489 --> 00:05:45,170
So we have to live well,

106
00:05:45,889 --> 00:05:46,369
right?

107
00:05:48,689 --> 00:05:49,170
Yeah.

108
00:05:55,489 --> 00:05:57,449
Blind dates? Oh, Mom.

109
00:05:57,970 --> 00:05:59,489
I'll find someone myself.

110
00:05:59,489 --> 00:06:00,569
Don't worry about it.

111
00:06:01,970 --> 00:06:03,650
I promise you'll be satisfied, okay?

112
00:06:06,090 --> 00:06:08,090
Fate can't be rushed.

113
00:06:09,249 --> 00:06:09,770
Oh my.

114
00:06:09,770 --> 00:06:11,290
I'm hanging up.

115
00:06:14,530 --> 00:06:15,210
Hello.

116
00:06:15,210 --> 00:06:16,493
What line is this?
[* "Line" sounds like "filling" in Mandarin]

117
00:06:18,129 --> 00:06:19,650
Pork and scallion. What's wrong?

118
00:06:20,929 --> 00:06:22,770
I'm asking, what line is this?

119
00:06:23,050 --> 00:06:23,770
Solid line.

120
00:06:25,090 --> 00:06:26,249
I'm sorry.

121
00:06:26,249 --> 00:06:27,689
I'm sorry. I'll move right away.

122
00:06:29,129 --> 00:06:29,770
Mingzhu!

123
00:06:30,290 --> 00:06:32,210
Hurry up. The traffic police are here.

124
00:06:35,889 --> 00:06:36,650
We're moving.

125
00:06:38,929 --> 00:06:39,569
Alright.

126
00:06:39,715 --> 00:06:40,730
I won't deduct points.

127
00:06:40,730 --> 00:06:41,689
Just a 200 yuan fine.

128
00:06:42,249 --> 00:06:43,090
No, please.

129
00:06:43,090 --> 00:06:44,650
My friend's pregnant.

130
00:06:44,650 --> 00:06:45,489
She can't walk fast.

131
00:06:45,489 --> 00:06:46,770
Yes, I'm pregnant.

132
00:06:47,137 --> 00:06:48,480
Do you have an ultrasound photo?

133
00:06:48,489 --> 00:06:49,610
Show it to the officer.

134
00:06:49,610 --> 00:06:50,689
It's real.

135
00:06:50,970 --> 00:06:52,569
She's pregnant.

136
00:06:53,730 --> 00:06:54,970
Alright. Move along.

137
00:06:54,970 --> 00:06:56,004
Okay. Thank you so much.

138
00:06:56,048 --> 00:06:56,982
Don't do it next time.

139
00:06:57,009 --> 00:06:58,689
Sure. Thank you, handsome officer.

140
00:07:08,770 --> 00:07:10,679
Li Store's meat buns are amazing.

141
00:07:10,680 --> 00:07:12,004
One bite and the juice bursts out.

142
00:07:13,170 --> 00:07:15,410
You know what?
I ran into a hospital brawl just now.

143
00:07:15,530 --> 00:07:16,569
It was scary.

144
00:07:16,850 --> 00:07:18,009
Hospital brawls

145
00:07:18,009 --> 00:07:19,889
are meant to scare people.

146
00:07:20,090 --> 00:07:21,009
If you get scared,

147
00:07:21,009 --> 00:07:22,249
they win.

148
00:07:22,449 --> 00:07:23,369
You should say this.

149
00:07:23,610 --> 00:07:24,929
"Come on. Come at me.

150
00:07:24,929 --> 00:07:26,170
I'm pregnant.

151
00:07:26,170 --> 00:07:28,329
If you win, you'll support me
and the baby for life.

152
00:07:28,329 --> 00:07:30,040
If you lose, I'll support you for life."

153
00:07:30,048 --> 00:07:31,000
Then you win.

154
00:07:32,530 --> 00:07:34,369
What would I do without you?

155
00:07:35,770 --> 00:07:37,170
Everyone can live without someone.

156
00:07:37,382 --> 00:07:39,050
You can live without Feng Jianqi too.

157
00:07:42,970 --> 00:07:44,369
You don't have to remind me. I know.

158
00:07:46,129 --> 00:07:47,689
My birth parents gave me away,

159
00:07:47,689 --> 00:07:48,569
and I survived.

160
00:07:49,689 --> 00:07:51,050
So I'll survive anything.

161
00:09:23,969 --> 00:09:25,530
You've found your sister?

162
00:09:26,490 --> 00:09:27,809
I'd say it's one-sided.

163
00:09:28,089 --> 00:09:29,609
We're not sure yet.

164
00:09:31,290 --> 00:09:32,809
I thought you were twins.

165
00:09:34,010 --> 00:09:35,490
You don't really look alike though.

166
00:09:35,650 --> 00:09:37,530
Right? I don't think so either.

167
00:09:37,530 --> 00:09:38,648
But my parents think we do,

168
00:09:38,693 --> 00:09:39,490
especially my mom.

169
00:09:40,410 --> 00:09:41,250
She's being dramatic.

170
00:09:41,650 --> 00:09:42,909
She can see all thirty years

171
00:09:42,910 --> 00:09:44,250
of hardship the girl's been through

172
00:09:44,250 --> 00:09:45,490
by reading her face.

173
00:09:45,849 --> 00:09:47,650
She wanted to rush over overnight.

174
00:09:47,650 --> 00:09:48,929
If I were your mom

175
00:09:49,370 --> 00:09:50,170
and found out

176
00:09:50,170 --> 00:09:51,449
I had another daughter at fifty,

177
00:09:51,449 --> 00:09:53,050
I'd rush over overnight too.

178
00:09:53,089 --> 00:09:54,170
I wouldn't wait a minute.

179
00:09:55,410 --> 00:09:56,410
I can understand.

180
00:09:58,170 --> 00:09:59,650
Why didn't my grandma

181
00:09:59,650 --> 00:10:01,050
tell her earlier?

182
00:10:03,370 --> 00:10:04,130
Zhidong,

183
00:10:04,804 --> 00:10:06,920
if your grandma hadn't preferred boys
over girls,

184
00:10:07,089 --> 00:10:08,770
the one sent away might've been you.

185
00:10:10,130 --> 00:10:11,050
That's possible.

186
00:10:11,804 --> 00:10:13,379
Let's go eat at Shen's Restaurant.

187
00:10:13,380 --> 00:10:15,010
Take a look at
what your sister looks like.

188
00:10:15,010 --> 00:10:16,290
See if she looks like you.

189
00:10:18,410 --> 00:10:19,969
She's your biological sister.

190
00:10:20,329 --> 00:10:21,490
Aren't you curious?

191
00:10:22,290 --> 00:10:23,603
Even if she is,

192
00:10:23,604 --> 00:10:25,626
that doesn't mean
she wants to acknowledge me.

193
00:10:25,648 --> 00:10:27,130
I can't just show up like that.

194
00:10:27,530 --> 00:10:28,650
They said online

195
00:10:28,650 --> 00:10:29,609
she's pregnant.

196
00:10:30,130 --> 00:10:31,569
That'd add to her pressure.

197
00:10:33,010 --> 00:10:34,050
True.

198
00:10:53,370 --> 00:10:54,290
Your little bag.

199
00:10:55,209 --> 00:10:56,089
I'm heading home.

200
00:10:56,089 --> 00:10:56,849
Get home safe.

201
00:10:56,849 --> 00:10:57,890
Just leaving like this?

202
00:11:04,290 --> 00:11:04,890
Bye-bye.

203
00:11:05,290 --> 00:11:05,969
Bye-bye.

204
00:11:11,671 --> 00:11:13,840
(If your grandma
hadn't favored boys over girls,)

205
00:11:14,050 --> 00:11:15,729
(the one sent away might've been you.)

206
00:11:16,089 --> 00:11:17,530
(She's your biological sister.)

207
00:11:18,050 --> 00:11:19,170
(Aren't you curious?)

208
00:11:33,290 --> 00:11:34,609
Dad, Mom, I'm home.

209
00:11:34,969 --> 00:11:35,650
Darling.

210
00:11:36,809 --> 00:11:39,209
Your dad bought your favorite durian.

211
00:11:39,604 --> 00:11:41,650
It's so expensive.
Only he would buy it for you.

212
00:11:42,689 --> 00:11:43,329
Dad.

213
00:11:43,849 --> 00:11:44,410
You're home.

214
00:11:44,410 --> 00:11:45,410
Sit and try it.

215
00:11:45,969 --> 00:11:46,689
Eat some fruit.

216
00:11:47,582 --> 00:11:49,410
We're having dumplings
and wontons tonight.

217
00:11:49,490 --> 00:11:50,449
You've wrapped so many.

218
00:11:51,609 --> 00:11:52,849
Did Zhidong send you home?

219
00:11:53,915 --> 00:11:55,680
You're going to get married
sooner or later.

220
00:11:55,849 --> 00:11:57,449
Both families will have to meet

221
00:11:57,449 --> 00:11:58,569
and talk.

222
00:11:59,290 --> 00:12:00,530
What's the rush?

223
00:12:00,890 --> 00:12:01,729
The girl's side

224
00:12:02,530 --> 00:12:04,290
shouldn't bring it up first.

225
00:12:04,490 --> 00:12:06,449
Bichen's not worried
about finding a husband.

226
00:12:06,449 --> 00:12:07,130
Yeah.

227
00:12:07,609 --> 00:12:09,170
Says who?

228
00:12:09,370 --> 00:12:11,770
The Xu family is all busy
looking for their daughter now.

229
00:12:11,969 --> 00:12:13,370
They don't care about their son.

230
00:12:13,490 --> 00:12:14,370
They do care.

231
00:12:14,370 --> 00:12:15,770
One thing at a time.

232
00:12:15,770 --> 00:12:16,770
I don't want to eat.

233
00:12:18,089 --> 00:12:20,490
The situation in Xu Zhidong's family
is too complicated.

234
00:12:20,809 --> 00:12:22,050
If I had known earlier,

235
00:12:22,290 --> 00:12:24,490
I would never have let Bichen date him.

236
00:12:29,210 --> 00:12:34,410
(Shen Family Restaurant)

237
00:12:49,026 --> 00:12:50,050
What are you doing here?

238
00:12:51,426 --> 00:12:52,960
What are you doing in front of my house?

239
00:12:54,671 --> 00:12:56,440
I'm talking to you. Can't you hear me?

240
00:12:57,410 --> 00:12:58,329
Who are you?

241
00:12:58,329 --> 00:12:59,130
Don't run!

242
00:13:00,337 --> 00:13:01,250
Sneaking photos again?

243
00:13:01,250 --> 00:13:01,809
Who are you?

244
00:13:02,770 --> 00:13:04,250
Talk! What are you doing here?

245
00:13:07,010 --> 00:13:07,569
Hey.

246
00:13:07,826 --> 00:13:08,840
What's wrong with you?

247
00:13:09,089 --> 00:13:10,010
Who are you?

248
00:13:10,809 --> 00:13:11,729
Who the heck are you?

249
00:13:11,729 --> 00:13:12,650
Sneaking photos again?

250
00:13:14,209 --> 00:13:14,770
Let go.

251
00:13:14,770 --> 00:13:16,130
You're hitting me?

252
00:13:31,050 --> 00:13:32,370
Here. Your ID cards.

253
00:13:32,370 --> 00:13:32,969
Thank you.

254
00:13:34,260 --> 00:13:35,849
(Xu Zhidong, March 26, 1994)

255
00:13:35,849 --> 00:13:36,609
This is yours.

256
00:13:37,490 --> 00:13:39,530
You have the same birthday as my sister.

257
00:13:47,329 --> 00:13:48,089
From Nanzhou?

258
00:13:50,569 --> 00:13:51,449
Which part of Nanzhou?

259
00:13:53,050 --> 00:13:54,449
Why did you try to run away?

260
00:13:55,890 --> 00:13:56,770
Who are your parents?

261
00:13:57,370 --> 00:13:58,609
Where's your hometown?

262
00:13:58,770 --> 00:13:59,929
Why are you asking so much?

263
00:14:00,929 --> 00:14:02,209
You don't get to ask.

264
00:14:03,729 --> 00:14:04,929
Who's coming for you?

265
00:14:04,937 --> 00:14:06,115
- My sister.
- My sister.

266
00:14:09,050 --> 00:14:09,890
Where is he?

267
00:14:11,170 --> 00:14:12,890
Ask them.

268
00:14:12,890 --> 00:14:13,689
Officer.

269
00:14:13,689 --> 00:14:14,929
- Get in line.
- I'm Xu...

270
00:14:15,050 --> 00:14:16,010
There's a queue here.

271
00:14:17,089 --> 00:14:17,729
Line up.

272
00:14:20,626 --> 00:14:22,469
Where's Zhidong? Is he all right?

273
00:14:22,470 --> 00:14:24,760
Don't worry, Mom.
Zhidong was the one who got beaten.

274
00:14:24,760 --> 00:14:26,250
We're in the right here. Don't worry.

275
00:14:26,982 --> 00:14:28,800
Someone from your family caused trouble?

276
00:14:29,130 --> 00:14:30,849
No. It's not that.

277
00:14:31,089 --> 00:14:32,849
We were the ones who got attacked.

278
00:14:32,849 --> 00:14:34,329
We're the victims.

279
00:14:35,770 --> 00:14:37,770
Was it two young guys fighting?

280
00:14:37,770 --> 00:14:38,809
With Hui.

281
00:14:39,370 --> 00:14:40,809
Hui?

282
00:14:40,969 --> 00:14:41,969
You don't know him?

283
00:14:41,969 --> 00:14:42,849
No.

284
00:14:43,849 --> 00:14:45,890
That brat is trouble.

285
00:14:45,890 --> 00:14:48,199
He spent five years in high school
and still didn't graduate.

286
00:14:48,200 --> 00:14:50,560
Everyone in the neighborhood
has suffered because of him.

287
00:14:50,737 --> 00:14:52,530
He even went after
his own brother-in-law.

288
00:14:52,530 --> 00:14:53,929
He stuck this huge snake

289
00:14:53,929 --> 00:14:55,650
into his brother-in-law's pants.

290
00:14:56,609 --> 00:14:57,209
What...

291
00:14:57,890 --> 00:14:59,729
What happened to the brother-in-law?

292
00:14:59,729 --> 00:15:00,530
He died.

293
00:15:06,929 --> 00:15:08,809
Your brother's an honest lad,

294
00:15:08,809 --> 00:15:10,530
and now he's caught up with that brat.

295
00:15:10,729 --> 00:15:12,969
We're in real trouble.

296
00:15:12,969 --> 00:15:13,689
It's okay, Mom.

297
00:15:14,130 --> 00:15:15,010
I'm here.

298
00:15:16,740 --> 00:15:18,990
Have the families
of Xu Zhidong and Shen Minghui arrived?

299
00:15:19,004 --> 00:15:19,737
Yes.

300
00:15:21,370 --> 00:15:22,370
Come with me.

301
00:15:24,410 --> 00:15:26,250
Where are we going?

302
00:15:29,530 --> 00:15:31,370
Mingzhu, that guy's family is here.

303
00:15:31,370 --> 00:15:32,660
I just told them

304
00:15:32,670 --> 00:15:33,950
about Minghui's glorious history.

305
00:15:33,969 --> 00:15:35,089
They were probably scared.

306
00:15:35,290 --> 00:15:36,449
They won't push him anymore.

307
00:15:36,449 --> 00:15:37,449
Hurry over.

308
00:15:38,290 --> 00:15:39,410
Shen Minghui. Xu Zhidong.

309
00:15:39,929 --> 00:15:40,729
Come out.

310
00:15:40,730 --> 00:15:41,800
- You've arrived?
- Zhidong.

311
00:15:41,809 --> 00:15:42,290
I'll come fetch you.

312
00:15:42,290 --> 00:15:42,849
Zhidong.

313
00:15:43,650 --> 00:15:44,449
Poor Zhidong.

314
00:15:44,449 --> 00:15:45,370
Why did you come, Mom?

315
00:15:45,370 --> 00:15:46,650
Zhidong, you...

316
00:15:46,782 --> 00:15:48,315
Why are you beaten up like this?

317
00:15:48,609 --> 00:15:50,089
Your clothes are torn.

318
00:15:50,370 --> 00:15:51,839
Shen Minghui's family isn't here yet.

319
00:15:51,840 --> 00:15:52,871
When his family gets here,

320
00:15:52,937 --> 00:15:54,050
we'll sort this out together.

321
00:15:54,050 --> 00:15:54,969
Thank you, officer.

322
00:15:55,250 --> 00:15:56,209
Come with me.

323
00:16:00,449 --> 00:16:01,490
Mom, you go back first.

324
00:16:01,671 --> 00:16:03,600
I'm not leaving.
I can't leave your sister alone.

325
00:16:03,609 --> 00:16:04,290
You hit him?

326
00:16:04,729 --> 00:16:05,490
We fought.

327
00:16:05,490 --> 00:16:06,782
My brother's always been honest.

328
00:16:06,804 --> 00:16:07,770
He wouldn't fight.

329
00:16:08,370 --> 00:16:10,800
Honest? Then why would he be taken
to the police station?

330
00:16:10,848 --> 00:16:12,048
To claim an ID card, is it?

331
00:16:12,609 --> 00:16:13,329
Don't...

332
00:16:13,650 --> 00:16:14,969
It's on you.

333
00:16:15,130 --> 00:16:16,010
You pushed him first

334
00:16:16,010 --> 00:16:17,410
and drove him to fight back.

335
00:16:17,410 --> 00:16:18,490
Aunty,

336
00:16:18,569 --> 00:16:20,370
fighting back is also assaulting.

337
00:16:20,448 --> 00:16:21,840
You've admitted the fault for him.

338
00:16:21,849 --> 00:16:22,689
What did he call me?

339
00:16:22,848 --> 00:16:24,315
- What did you call me?
- Aunty.

340
00:16:24,329 --> 00:16:25,130
Aunty.

341
00:16:25,130 --> 00:16:25,849
You brat.

342
00:16:25,849 --> 00:16:26,729
Are you blind?

343
00:16:26,729 --> 00:16:27,803
You call me aunty? You!

344
00:16:27,804 --> 00:16:29,004
You think nobody can control you?

345
00:16:29,010 --> 00:16:30,250
Today, I'm putting you in your place.

346
00:16:30,250 --> 00:16:30,969
Zhixia.

347
00:16:30,969 --> 00:16:31,569
Come on.

348
00:16:31,569 --> 00:16:32,569
You little rascal.

349
00:16:33,729 --> 00:16:34,650
I didn't touch you.

350
00:16:35,969 --> 00:16:36,847
She hit me.

351
00:16:36,848 --> 00:16:38,050
- I didn't do it.
- Officer.

352
00:16:38,050 --> 00:16:38,609
What happened?

353
00:16:38,609 --> 00:16:39,250
I didn't hit him.

354
00:16:39,250 --> 00:16:40,960
What are you all making
a fuss about in the station?

355
00:16:40,969 --> 00:16:43,170
Officer, hear me out.

356
00:16:43,170 --> 00:16:43,960
Please hear me out.

357
00:16:44,004 --> 00:16:45,010
My son got beaten up,

358
00:16:45,010 --> 00:16:46,400
but we won't pursue it anymore.

359
00:16:46,404 --> 00:16:47,370
Really, we won't.

360
00:16:47,400 --> 00:16:49,404
I just want to say something to the boy.

361
00:16:49,426 --> 00:16:50,890
I didn't touch him. He fell on his own.

362
00:16:50,890 --> 00:16:52,410
Boy, how about this?

363
00:16:52,490 --> 00:16:53,929
Let's not drag this out.

364
00:16:54,130 --> 00:16:55,569
Can we settle this privately?

365
00:16:55,582 --> 00:16:56,448
Settle this privately?

366
00:16:56,493 --> 00:16:57,170
Yes.

367
00:16:58,050 --> 00:16:59,809
Fine. We'll settle this privately.

368
00:16:59,890 --> 00:17:01,130
Absolutely not.

369
00:17:01,404 --> 00:17:02,737
That'd be too easy for you.

370
00:17:02,760 --> 00:17:04,400
I'm going to put you
in your place today.

371
00:17:04,409 --> 00:17:06,730
Zhixia. I accept a private settlement.

372
00:17:06,730 --> 00:17:07,329
He fell again.

373
00:17:07,329 --> 00:17:08,210
I accept a private settlement.

374
00:17:08,210 --> 00:17:08,690
I didn't hit him.

375
00:17:08,690 --> 00:17:09,329
You did.

376
00:17:09,329 --> 00:17:10,569
I wasn't totally right either.

377
00:17:10,569 --> 00:17:13,159
I admitted fault to the officer,
and we apologized to each other.

378
00:17:13,160 --> 00:17:14,360
Settle it privately and go home.

379
00:17:14,404 --> 00:17:15,160
Xu Zhidong,

380
00:17:15,649 --> 00:17:17,530
you got bullied by a high-schooler,

381
00:17:17,530 --> 00:17:18,730
and you apologize?

382
00:17:18,970 --> 00:17:20,649
You're such a coward.

383
00:17:21,010 --> 00:17:22,730
What's it? Your eyes?

384
00:17:22,893 --> 00:17:24,080
What's wrong with your eyes?

385
00:17:24,089 --> 00:17:24,849
Were you hit?

386
00:17:26,770 --> 00:17:27,409
Minghui.

387
00:17:28,329 --> 00:17:28,970
Mingzhu!

388
00:17:31,010 --> 00:17:31,730
Careful.

389
00:17:32,010 --> 00:17:32,690
Minghui!

390
00:17:34,010 --> 00:17:34,649
Mingzhu,

391
00:17:34,826 --> 00:17:35,600
why did you come?

392
00:17:35,609 --> 00:17:36,490
Are you okay?

393
00:17:36,649 --> 00:17:37,329
I'm fine.

394
00:17:37,490 --> 00:17:38,649
How did it get this bad?

395
00:17:38,649 --> 00:17:40,129
Mom, it's Shen Mingzhu.

396
00:17:40,609 --> 00:17:40,970
Who?

397
00:17:40,970 --> 00:17:41,770
Shen Mingzhu.

398
00:17:42,490 --> 00:17:43,290
Zhilu.

399
00:17:46,849 --> 00:17:47,770
Miss Shen.

400
00:17:50,849 --> 00:17:51,730
You betrayed me.

401
00:17:52,329 --> 00:17:53,290
Mrs. Zhang.

402
00:17:54,290 --> 00:17:55,409
What a coincidence.

403
00:17:55,809 --> 00:17:56,569
Well?

404
00:17:57,409 --> 00:17:58,250
My brother.

405
00:17:59,210 --> 00:18:00,089
And he?

406
00:18:01,530 --> 00:18:02,329
My brother.

407
00:18:03,169 --> 00:18:04,250
So you all know each other?

408
00:18:04,250 --> 00:18:05,530
How do you know each other?

409
00:18:05,871 --> 00:18:07,320
This isn't the place for chit-chat.

410
00:18:07,970 --> 00:18:08,569
Alright.

411
00:18:08,626 --> 00:18:10,226
Both of them are willing to mediate.

412
00:18:10,250 --> 00:18:10,889
Madams,

413
00:18:10,889 --> 00:18:12,329
if both families have no objection,

414
00:18:12,450 --> 00:18:13,530
sign the paper later,

415
00:18:13,530 --> 00:18:14,369
and you can go home.

416
00:18:15,329 --> 00:18:16,569
Is that okay, Mrs. Zhang?

417
00:18:16,970 --> 00:18:18,450
Sure.

418
00:18:18,569 --> 00:18:19,849
Alright. One second.

419
00:18:26,730 --> 00:18:27,530
Wait.

420
00:18:28,050 --> 00:18:29,010
Wait.

421
00:18:29,129 --> 00:18:29,809
- Mom.
- Mom.

422
00:18:29,809 --> 00:18:30,569
Hold on, girl.

423
00:18:30,569 --> 00:18:31,169
Mom.

424
00:18:31,409 --> 00:18:32,329
Wait a minute.

425
00:18:33,448 --> 00:18:34,530
What are you trying to do?

426
00:18:34,970 --> 00:18:35,690
Girl.

427
00:18:38,010 --> 00:18:40,089
Are you adopted?

428
00:18:42,809 --> 00:18:44,690
I... I'm Yu Jingxiang.

429
00:18:45,930 --> 00:18:48,329
I'm your biological mother.

430
00:18:48,848 --> 00:18:50,930
Who are you? What nonsense
are you talking about?

431
00:18:50,930 --> 00:18:52,690
No, I...

432
00:18:52,690 --> 00:18:53,329
Enough, Mom.

433
00:18:53,569 --> 00:18:54,089
Miss Shen.

434
00:18:54,089 --> 00:18:54,890
Don't talk about it now.

435
00:18:54,893 --> 00:18:55,640
Here's the thing.

436
00:18:56,089 --> 00:18:57,010
Our family

437
00:18:57,649 --> 00:18:59,169
once gave away a baby girl.

438
00:18:59,182 --> 00:19:01,582
Recently, my parents
have been desperately searching for her,

439
00:19:01,626 --> 00:19:02,915
and the leads brought us to you.

440
00:19:03,210 --> 00:19:04,079
The time and place

441
00:19:04,080 --> 00:19:06,182
when my grandma gave her away
match your situation.

442
00:19:06,409 --> 00:19:07,089
So...

443
00:19:08,329 --> 00:19:08,970
Zhidong.

444
00:19:08,970 --> 00:19:09,730
ID card.

445
00:19:09,809 --> 00:19:10,409
Right.

446
00:19:10,409 --> 00:19:11,050
He could be

447
00:19:11,050 --> 00:19:12,329
your twin brother.

448
00:19:12,329 --> 00:19:13,770
Yes.

449
00:19:13,889 --> 00:19:14,930
Look at the ID card.

450
00:19:15,169 --> 00:19:16,329
Look at the birthdate.

451
00:19:16,809 --> 00:19:18,450
You two were born on the same day.

452
00:19:18,450 --> 00:19:19,010
Right?

453
00:19:19,250 --> 00:19:19,809
Look.

454
00:19:24,089 --> 00:19:24,809
Miss Shen,

455
00:19:25,649 --> 00:19:26,409
if you

456
00:19:27,089 --> 00:19:28,050
don't believe us,

457
00:19:28,050 --> 00:19:28,690
we can

458
00:19:30,089 --> 00:19:31,409
do a paternity test.

459
00:19:31,809 --> 00:19:32,809
Paternity test?

460
00:19:33,010 --> 00:19:35,329
Yes. It's easy now.

461
00:19:35,329 --> 00:19:37,329
Hair, a toothbrush,

462
00:19:37,329 --> 00:19:38,450
saliva, or anything will do.

463
00:19:38,450 --> 00:19:39,569
The piano lessons

464
00:19:40,290 --> 00:19:41,409
and the turnip cabbage.

465
00:19:42,770 --> 00:19:44,569
You approached me on purpose,
didn't you?

466
00:19:44,569 --> 00:19:46,169
So you've been acting this whole time?

467
00:19:46,310 --> 00:19:47,709
You're trying to take my sister away

468
00:19:47,710 --> 00:19:48,560
with such low tricks.

469
00:19:48,569 --> 00:19:49,409
You're despicable.

470
00:19:49,530 --> 00:19:51,050
You're shameless. Don't come near.

471
00:19:51,050 --> 00:19:52,250
Don't touch my sister.

472
00:19:52,293 --> 00:19:53,050
What are you doing?

473
00:19:53,050 --> 00:19:53,970
What are you trying to do?

474
00:19:53,970 --> 00:19:55,293
Shen Mingzhu! Stay back, Mingzhu!

475
00:19:55,293 --> 00:19:56,320
You haven't beaten enough?

476
00:19:56,400 --> 00:19:57,048
Huh?

477
00:19:57,071 --> 00:19:58,560
- Stop fighting.
- Let's talk nicely.

478
00:19:58,569 --> 00:19:59,770
Stop, Minghui.

479
00:19:59,826 --> 00:20:00,970
You think I'm afraid of you?

480
00:20:00,970 --> 00:20:01,930
Minghui, stop it.

481
00:20:01,930 --> 00:20:02,840
We can talk peacefully.

482
00:20:02,850 --> 00:20:04,050
Don't you dare touch my sister!

483
00:20:04,050 --> 00:20:04,809
No means no.

484
00:20:04,809 --> 00:20:05,809
- Shen Minghui!
- Stop it.

485
00:20:05,809 --> 00:20:06,569
Mom,

486
00:20:06,569 --> 00:20:07,160
let them fight.

487
00:20:07,170 --> 00:20:08,630
If you weren't Shen Mingzhu's brother,

488
00:20:08,640 --> 00:20:09,520
I'd beat you to death.

489
00:20:09,530 --> 00:20:10,379
You want a fight?

490
00:20:10,380 --> 00:20:11,890
Whoever starts the fight
is in the wrong.

491
00:20:11,890 --> 00:20:13,804
When the Shen family begs us
for reconciliation,

492
00:20:13,810 --> 00:20:15,493
that'll be the chance
to get close to her.

493
00:20:15,493 --> 00:20:16,730
Shen Minghui, use your brain.

494
00:20:16,730 --> 00:20:18,569
If you throw that punch, you might lose

495
00:20:18,569 --> 00:20:20,290
your sister.

496
00:20:20,290 --> 00:20:21,290
Think carefully.

497
00:20:21,290 --> 00:20:21,930
You can hit me,

498
00:20:21,930 --> 00:20:23,271
but you can't touch my sister.

499
00:20:23,290 --> 00:20:24,889
- My pitiful son.
- Understood?

500
00:20:25,137 --> 00:20:25,880
It's tough for you.

501
00:20:25,889 --> 00:20:26,450
Go.

502
00:20:30,809 --> 00:20:31,649
I'm sorry.

503
00:20:32,648 --> 00:20:34,080
What happened just now was on me.

504
00:20:34,490 --> 00:20:36,010
Please forgive me.

505
00:20:36,530 --> 00:20:37,409
I apologize.

506
00:20:39,010 --> 00:20:40,050
An apology is an apology.

507
00:20:40,569 --> 00:20:42,450
But Mingzhu is still my sister.

508
00:20:45,329 --> 00:20:46,450
Wait, girl.

509
00:20:46,730 --> 00:20:47,169
Mom.

510
00:20:47,169 --> 00:20:48,089
Zhilu.

511
00:20:48,210 --> 00:20:49,290
Let me just say one more.

512
00:20:49,290 --> 00:20:50,639
Please.

513
00:20:50,640 --> 00:20:51,160
Don't say it.

514
00:20:51,160 --> 00:20:52,530
Just one sentence. I'll just say one.

515
00:20:52,530 --> 00:20:53,871
You don't need to say anything.

516
00:20:54,250 --> 00:20:55,290
I don't know you.

517
00:20:56,490 --> 00:20:57,730
My name is Shen Mingzhu.

518
00:21:00,889 --> 00:21:01,730
Careful, madam.

519
00:21:01,930 --> 00:21:03,609
Zhilu.

520
00:21:03,770 --> 00:21:05,250
Girl!

521
00:21:05,809 --> 00:21:06,409
Mom.

522
00:21:06,649 --> 00:21:07,809
Mom.

523
00:21:07,930 --> 00:21:09,050
Mom, look at this.

524
00:21:09,730 --> 00:21:10,569
What is this?

525
00:21:10,569 --> 00:21:11,930
Zhilu's hair.

526
00:21:12,210 --> 00:21:13,770
I don't want hair.

527
00:21:13,770 --> 00:21:15,250
I want my child.

528
00:21:15,250 --> 00:21:16,530
Paternity test.

529
00:21:30,690 --> 00:21:32,930
What exactly did Zhilu say?

530
00:21:34,530 --> 00:21:35,329
She said,

531
00:21:36,770 --> 00:21:38,329
she doesn't know me.

532
00:21:39,409 --> 00:21:41,010
Before today,

533
00:21:42,210 --> 00:21:44,290
she really didn't know us.

534
00:21:45,569 --> 00:21:48,569
But after today, she does.

535
00:21:48,930 --> 00:21:51,770
And she knows them too.

536
00:21:52,690 --> 00:21:53,290
Dad,

537
00:21:54,315 --> 00:21:56,050
it's not that she doesn't recognize us.

538
00:21:56,809 --> 00:21:57,649
She just refuses to.

539
00:21:59,930 --> 00:22:01,250
What kind of talk is that?

540
00:22:02,329 --> 00:22:04,290
We're her real parents,

541
00:22:05,409 --> 00:22:08,089
and blood is always thicker than water.

542
00:22:09,569 --> 00:22:11,409
How did that child end up being raised

543
00:22:11,409 --> 00:22:13,530
to be so cold and ungrateful?

544
00:22:15,210 --> 00:22:15,770
Dad,

545
00:22:15,915 --> 00:22:17,490
why should our Xu family's daughter

546
00:22:18,329 --> 00:22:19,809
be raised by someone else?

547
00:22:20,970 --> 00:22:21,809
Who should we ask?

548
00:22:23,089 --> 00:22:25,089
Ask that old Madam Yu.

549
00:22:25,809 --> 00:22:27,050
Ask her yourself.

550
00:22:28,010 --> 00:22:29,089
Listen to me,

551
00:22:29,569 --> 00:22:30,409
this year,

552
00:22:30,409 --> 00:22:33,050
I'll let it go.

553
00:22:33,530 --> 00:22:37,210
But if anyone
visits her grave next year,

554
00:22:37,210 --> 00:22:37,770
I...

555
00:22:37,770 --> 00:22:38,490
I'll go.

556
00:22:40,210 --> 00:22:41,089
What will you do?

557
00:22:41,609 --> 00:22:43,290
I'll break your legs.

558
00:22:43,290 --> 00:22:44,010
Go on then.

559
00:22:44,490 --> 00:22:45,290
Come on, hit me.

560
00:22:45,809 --> 00:22:47,490
If you don't, you're not yourself.

561
00:22:47,690 --> 00:22:48,329
I'm warning you,

562
00:22:48,329 --> 00:22:49,210
if you break me,

563
00:22:49,210 --> 00:22:51,293
I'll be in a wheelchair,
and you'll be in prison.

564
00:22:51,490 --> 00:22:53,329
I'm not afraid of prison.

565
00:22:53,930 --> 00:22:54,930
I'm warning you,

566
00:22:54,930 --> 00:22:55,770
Yu family,

567
00:22:55,770 --> 00:22:57,290
don't push me.

568
00:22:57,649 --> 00:22:59,089
I...

569
00:23:03,849 --> 00:23:04,649
I provoked you.

570
00:23:05,210 --> 00:23:05,930
What now?

571
00:23:05,930 --> 00:23:06,770
What are you doing?

572
00:23:07,360 --> 00:23:08,120
What are you doing?

573
00:23:08,120 --> 00:23:09,293
Tell me, what are you doing?

574
00:23:09,770 --> 00:23:10,530
Let's separate.

575
00:23:10,530 --> 00:23:11,889
If you touch me...

576
00:23:11,889 --> 00:23:12,930
I'll touch you.

577
00:23:13,889 --> 00:23:14,770
You really did.

578
00:23:14,930 --> 00:23:15,450
Yes.

579
00:23:15,450 --> 00:23:16,409
Do it again.

580
00:23:17,129 --> 00:23:17,730
Fine!

581
00:23:17,730 --> 00:23:18,290
You...

582
00:23:19,569 --> 00:23:21,010
Our life now

583
00:23:21,329 --> 00:23:23,210
is either graves or police visits.

584
00:23:23,315 --> 00:23:25,426
No wonder Shen Mingzhu
won't recognize you.

585
00:23:25,889 --> 00:23:27,050
Even I don't want to.

586
00:23:31,970 --> 00:23:32,889
Let's eat first.

587
00:23:41,930 --> 00:23:42,530
Minghui.

588
00:23:42,826 --> 00:23:43,880
What's wrong, Mingzhu?

589
00:23:46,226 --> 00:23:47,530
About what happened today,

590
00:23:48,115 --> 00:23:49,490
don't tell Mom and Dad, okay?

591
00:23:50,210 --> 00:23:51,369
I already told them.

592
00:23:52,690 --> 00:23:53,809
What did you say?

593
00:23:54,129 --> 00:23:55,730
I... I just told the truth.

594
00:23:56,409 --> 00:23:57,803
That family is very cunning.

595
00:23:57,804 --> 00:23:59,560
They've had their eye on us
for a long time.

596
00:24:00,569 --> 00:24:02,169
Why do you blurt things out so fast?

597
00:24:02,889 --> 00:24:04,250
It's already been said.

598
00:24:04,448 --> 00:24:06,426
Mom and Dad
will find out sooner or later.

599
00:24:08,730 --> 00:24:09,970
Go on, do your homework.

600
00:24:37,129 --> 00:24:38,690
What's the matter, tossing and turning?

601
00:24:39,889 --> 00:24:40,690
Can't sleep?

602
00:24:40,970 --> 00:24:41,730
Just that...

603
00:24:43,770 --> 00:24:44,770
Minghui said that family

604
00:24:44,770 --> 00:24:46,569
has been watching us for ages.

605
00:24:50,129 --> 00:24:51,050
When did he say that?

606
00:24:51,369 --> 00:24:53,329
He said it today.

607
00:24:54,290 --> 00:24:55,490
What are you thinking?

608
00:24:56,182 --> 00:24:58,010
They've had their eye
on us for a long time.

609
00:25:11,690 --> 00:25:12,450
At the time,

610
00:25:14,129 --> 00:25:15,530
I didn't have a strong impression.

611
00:25:16,649 --> 00:25:17,569
That old lady

612
00:25:17,569 --> 00:25:19,010
gave the child to us to raise.

613
00:25:22,169 --> 00:25:23,799
Did she give us an address?

614
00:25:23,800 --> 00:25:25,004
A phone number or anything?

615
00:25:25,970 --> 00:25:27,970
There was no address and no phone.

616
00:25:28,730 --> 00:25:30,409
Nothing at all.

617
00:25:33,129 --> 00:25:34,970
Why are you asking this all of a sudden?

618
00:25:35,210 --> 00:25:36,409
I'm just puzzled.

619
00:25:37,809 --> 00:25:38,970
You said there was nothing.

620
00:25:40,210 --> 00:25:42,169
No one looked for us all these years.

621
00:25:43,290 --> 00:25:45,609
How did they suddenly find our doorstep?

622
00:25:46,089 --> 00:25:47,290
And find it so precisely.

623
00:25:48,210 --> 00:25:49,089
This is strange.

624
00:25:49,089 --> 00:25:50,809
Yeah, I'm puzzled too.

625
00:25:50,809 --> 00:25:51,970
Aren't you puzzled as well?

626
00:25:52,690 --> 00:25:53,849
I'm so thirsty. Give me...

627
00:25:54,250 --> 00:25:55,770
It's so stuffy. Get me some water.

628
00:25:56,690 --> 00:25:57,409
No, it's too cold.

629
00:25:57,409 --> 00:25:58,369
Make it warm, please.

630
00:26:00,490 --> 00:26:01,089
Wait.

631
00:26:02,649 --> 00:26:03,490
Get some medicine?

632
00:26:03,730 --> 00:26:05,319
No medicine. Just add hot water.

633
00:26:05,320 --> 00:26:06,937
Go downstairs and fetch some hot water.

634
00:26:30,220 --> 00:26:34,160
(No. 68 Wen Zhong Avenue, Xidi Road,
Gucheng District, Nanzhou City.)

635
00:26:34,160 --> 00:26:35,515
(26 March, 1994)

636
00:27:00,409 --> 00:27:02,010
Dinner's ready!

637
00:27:02,169 --> 00:27:04,329
We've got big drumsticks tonight.

638
00:27:04,930 --> 00:27:06,490
One for Mingzhu, and one for Minghui.

639
00:27:07,849 --> 00:27:09,210
Mingzhu gets the bigger one.

640
00:27:09,849 --> 00:27:10,889
Look at our boy.

641
00:27:11,089 --> 00:27:12,609
He's cared for his sister at this age.

642
00:27:12,609 --> 00:27:13,450
Good lad.

643
00:27:15,169 --> 00:27:15,930
Here, Mingzhu.

644
00:27:15,930 --> 00:27:17,290
Careful, it's hot. Eat up.

645
00:27:19,409 --> 00:27:20,050
Mom.

646
00:27:21,530 --> 00:27:23,450
I'm not your real daughter, am I?

647
00:27:29,050 --> 00:27:30,450
We had a health check at school.

648
00:27:30,809 --> 00:27:31,970
My blood type is B,

649
00:27:32,490 --> 00:27:35,450
but the book says two people
with type A blood

650
00:27:35,450 --> 00:27:37,490
can't have a child with type B blood.

651
00:27:40,250 --> 00:27:42,329
Then how do you know

652
00:27:42,450 --> 00:27:44,050
your mom and I both have type A?

653
00:27:44,569 --> 00:27:46,450
I heard it when you two

654
00:27:46,690 --> 00:27:48,089
donated blood last time.

655
00:27:54,089 --> 00:27:54,770
Don't hide it.

656
00:27:56,089 --> 00:27:56,889
It's pointless now.

657
00:28:03,010 --> 00:28:03,690
Mingzhu.

658
00:28:04,970 --> 00:28:05,930
Years ago,

659
00:28:06,782 --> 00:28:09,026
your mom and I
went to the countryside for vegetables.

660
00:28:09,569 --> 00:28:11,849
A family there had twins.

661
00:28:12,648 --> 00:28:13,871
They couldn't raise both,

662
00:28:14,770 --> 00:28:16,129
so they gave you to us.

663
00:28:18,770 --> 00:28:19,609
At that time,

664
00:28:19,609 --> 00:28:22,050
you were just this tiny.

665
00:28:23,369 --> 00:28:24,730
We brought you home,

666
00:28:25,889 --> 00:28:27,609
and raised you like our own.

667
00:28:34,369 --> 00:28:34,970
Mingzhu,

668
00:28:36,930 --> 00:28:38,649
you were fed with my milk,

669
00:28:39,930 --> 00:28:41,369
and raised by us.

670
00:28:41,849 --> 00:28:43,210
You're our daughter.

671
00:28:43,569 --> 00:28:44,250
Mingzhu,

672
00:28:45,889 --> 00:28:47,690
you'll understand when you grow up,

673
00:28:49,471 --> 00:28:51,448
that being raised
counts more than being born.

674
00:28:53,609 --> 00:28:55,530
I don't need to grow up to know that.

675
00:28:55,730 --> 00:28:56,809
This is my home.

676
00:28:56,970 --> 00:28:58,530
You're my mom and dad.

677
00:29:03,169 --> 00:29:03,849
Mingzhu.

678
00:29:06,129 --> 00:29:07,590
Mingzhu, eat more.

679
00:29:07,590 --> 00:29:08,490
Have some vegetables.

680
00:29:08,490 --> 00:29:09,649
Eat more rice too.

681
00:29:09,649 --> 00:29:11,450
Mingzhu, eat more.

682
00:29:11,649 --> 00:29:13,169
- Yes.
- Eat more, Mingzhu.

683
00:29:13,409 --> 00:29:14,450
You too, Minghui.

684
00:29:14,450 --> 00:29:15,730
Eat more, both of you.

685
00:29:24,730 --> 00:29:25,730
Hello, Ni.

686
00:29:25,970 --> 00:29:27,809
(Ni Makeup Studio)
Mingzhu, are you asleep?

687
00:29:28,210 --> 00:29:28,889
Not yet.

688
00:29:29,770 --> 00:29:30,770
I knew it.

689
00:29:30,782 --> 00:29:32,100
Come out for a late-night snack.

690
00:29:32,210 --> 00:29:32,889
Now?

691
00:29:33,690 --> 00:29:34,690
I'm pregnant.

692
00:29:35,129 --> 00:29:36,409
Pregnant women can't eat supper?

693
00:29:36,609 --> 00:29:37,730
Which doctor said that?

694
00:29:41,182 --> 00:29:42,880
I was looking
through my photo album today.

695
00:29:43,569 --> 00:29:44,809
From my first birthday till now,

696
00:29:45,369 --> 00:29:46,690
there's a photo for every year.

697
00:29:47,169 --> 00:29:49,490
From three people to four in the family.

698
00:29:50,329 --> 00:29:51,569
Last year, with Jianqi,

699
00:29:52,129 --> 00:29:53,490
we became a family of five.

700
00:29:55,010 --> 00:29:56,210
Then, Jianqi passed away.

701
00:29:58,169 --> 00:30:00,450
My birth parents suddenly showed up.

702
00:30:00,490 --> 00:30:01,690
And you even have siblings.

703
00:30:01,690 --> 00:30:03,290
The two brothers fought today.

704
00:30:05,530 --> 00:30:07,290
Life's joys and sorrows

705
00:30:07,290 --> 00:30:08,690
all hit me at once.

706
00:30:09,169 --> 00:30:10,290
Just this past month,

707
00:30:10,369 --> 00:30:11,970
I've felt it all.

708
00:30:15,809 --> 00:30:17,369
Excuse me. Two tea eggs, please.

709
00:30:17,369 --> 00:30:18,010
Got it.

710
00:30:20,250 --> 00:30:21,290
Eat something.

711
00:30:24,889 --> 00:30:25,930
Tea eggs, here.

712
00:30:26,530 --> 00:30:27,210
Thanks.

713
00:30:28,010 --> 00:30:30,649
Listen, life's ups and downs
don't fill your stomach.

714
00:30:35,609 --> 00:30:36,530
Ni, tell me.

715
00:30:37,210 --> 00:30:39,490
If my birth parents
insist on taking me back,

716
00:30:39,809 --> 00:30:40,569
what should I do?

717
00:30:40,569 --> 00:30:42,210
If they're rich, just go with it.

718
00:30:42,329 --> 00:30:43,530
Why refuse free money?

719
00:30:46,089 --> 00:30:47,649
If only Jianqi were here.

720
00:30:47,889 --> 00:30:49,450
He'd help me figure it all out.

721
00:30:50,129 --> 00:30:50,930
I know.

722
00:30:51,369 --> 00:30:52,770
Jianqi's gone.

723
00:30:53,329 --> 00:30:54,609
It's just me now.

724
00:30:55,649 --> 00:30:56,329
And you.

725
00:31:02,250 --> 00:31:02,889
Mother.

726
00:31:06,089 --> 00:31:07,690
Since you've blessed us,

727
00:31:08,290 --> 00:31:09,730
and let Xiang and me

728
00:31:10,409 --> 00:31:12,329
find our second daughter Zhilu,

729
00:31:13,609 --> 00:31:16,129
please keep helping us.

730
00:31:16,970 --> 00:31:19,849
Grant her some guidance,

731
00:31:20,930 --> 00:31:24,010
so she'll be willing to recognize us.

732
00:31:25,290 --> 00:31:26,770
Please, Mother.

733
00:31:28,250 --> 00:31:29,089
Dear Mother.

734
00:31:29,930 --> 00:31:31,569
I beg you.

735
00:31:32,409 --> 00:31:33,649
I beg you.

736
00:31:34,609 --> 00:31:35,210
Mother.

737
00:31:36,089 --> 00:31:37,530
Let me bow to you.

738
00:32:01,889 --> 00:32:02,569
Miss.

739
00:32:02,889 --> 00:32:05,089
Excuse me, may I ask you something?

740
00:32:05,329 --> 00:32:07,129
Where's Shen Family Restaurant?

741
00:32:07,129 --> 00:32:08,569
It's right here.

742
00:32:10,050 --> 00:32:10,930
This one?

743
00:32:10,930 --> 00:32:12,050
Okay. Thank you.

744
00:32:12,050 --> 00:32:12,530
No problem.

745
00:32:12,530 --> 00:32:13,329
Alright, thanks.

746
00:32:13,329 --> 00:32:14,089
Goodbye.

747
00:32:14,089 --> 00:32:14,649
Bye.

748
00:33:08,050 --> 00:33:09,129
This one tastes...

749
00:33:09,129 --> 00:33:09,690
Better?

750
00:33:09,690 --> 00:33:10,490
Not as sweet.

751
00:33:12,169 --> 00:33:12,889
What's wrong?

752
00:33:12,889 --> 00:33:13,290
Mom.

753
00:33:13,290 --> 00:33:13,849
What is it?

754
00:33:13,970 --> 00:33:14,849
That woman.

755
00:33:15,169 --> 00:33:15,730
Who?

756
00:33:15,804 --> 00:33:17,210
The one from the police station.

757
00:33:17,226 --> 00:33:18,960
The one who said she's my sister's mom.

758
00:33:22,293 --> 00:33:23,530
I'll go tell her to leave.

759
00:33:23,649 --> 00:33:24,809
Don't. Wait.

760
00:33:25,730 --> 00:33:27,050
You go inside first.

761
00:33:27,450 --> 00:33:28,450
You sure about that?

762
00:33:29,010 --> 00:33:29,770
Go, go on.

763
00:33:59,169 --> 00:33:59,970
- Sorry.
-You...

764
00:33:59,970 --> 00:34:01,530
Sorry, madam. I splashed you.

765
00:34:03,010 --> 00:34:04,730
What are you doing?

766
00:34:04,730 --> 00:34:06,071
What's wrong with your family?

767
00:34:06,115 --> 00:34:06,730
Lost something?

768
00:34:06,730 --> 00:34:08,515
Why stand at our door
looking so miserable?

769
00:34:08,609 --> 00:34:09,647
We're running a business.

770
00:34:09,648 --> 00:34:10,680
Don't bring bad luck here.

771
00:34:10,690 --> 00:34:11,769
Mom, the meal is ready.

772
00:34:12,209 --> 00:34:12,810
Let's go.

773
00:34:13,249 --> 00:34:14,769
There are too many people around.

774
00:34:14,970 --> 00:34:16,289
Don't come again, alright?

775
00:34:16,289 --> 00:34:16,970
It's not safe.

776
00:34:17,050 --> 00:34:18,026
Come on, let's eat.

777
00:34:19,609 --> 00:34:20,490
Go home now.

778
00:34:23,249 --> 00:34:23,850
Let's go.

779
00:34:36,850 --> 00:34:37,729
I don't know you.

780
00:34:39,129 --> 00:34:40,410
My name is Shen Mingzhu.

781
00:35:14,890 --> 00:35:18,129
The fingers brushed the water
like ripples on a lake.

782
00:35:21,370 --> 00:35:22,129
Look at this.

783
00:35:22,609 --> 00:35:24,050
Jiao's been working so hard.

784
00:35:25,410 --> 00:35:26,050
Jiao.

785
00:35:26,760 --> 00:35:28,240
Dad's calling you for breakfast again.

786
00:35:28,649 --> 00:35:29,530
Coming.

787
00:35:31,330 --> 00:35:33,249
That's the magic of praise.

788
00:35:33,569 --> 00:35:36,010
Ever since Mingzhu
tutored her last time,

789
00:35:36,050 --> 00:35:37,010
look at our Jiao now.

790
00:35:37,010 --> 00:35:38,330
She's doing great.

791
00:35:38,609 --> 00:35:39,649
Alright, enough.

792
00:35:39,970 --> 00:35:41,490
Every time I think about

793
00:35:41,490 --> 00:35:42,649
those long-lost siblings,

794
00:35:42,649 --> 00:35:43,890
my head hurts.

795
00:35:43,890 --> 00:35:45,410
Then we won't mention them.

796
00:35:45,490 --> 00:35:46,649
They're grown-ups anyway.

797
00:35:47,249 --> 00:35:49,530
Here, have your egg sunny-side up.

798
00:35:54,129 --> 00:35:54,890
What's wrong?

799
00:35:54,890 --> 00:35:55,649
Mom, what's wrong?

800
00:35:56,289 --> 00:35:57,169
Wipe it off.

801
00:35:59,010 --> 00:35:59,649
You okay?

802
00:36:00,249 --> 00:36:01,450
Pregnancy looks so hard.

803
00:36:02,209 --> 00:36:03,530
Maybe you shouldn't have the baby.

804
00:36:07,490 --> 00:36:09,569
I know Mom's been struggling.

805
00:36:10,050 --> 00:36:12,089
So we should cheer her up more.

806
00:36:12,410 --> 00:36:13,129
Alright?

807
00:36:13,289 --> 00:36:13,970
I'm fine.

808
00:36:14,649 --> 00:36:15,649
Let's eat.

809
00:36:15,649 --> 00:36:16,490
Breakfast time.

810
00:36:16,810 --> 00:36:17,850
What's happening?

811
00:36:18,569 --> 00:36:20,370
It's been almost two months, right?

812
00:36:20,649 --> 00:36:21,890
Why does it seem worse

813
00:36:21,890 --> 00:36:22,890
than when you had Jiao?

814
00:36:22,930 --> 00:36:24,010
You don't understand.

815
00:36:24,010 --> 00:36:26,370
At two months,
every smell feels stronger.

816
00:36:27,850 --> 00:36:31,010
You really should read this app.

817
00:36:32,209 --> 00:36:34,249
Then you'll know
how hard it is for women.

818
00:36:35,050 --> 00:36:36,010
Nine weeks in.

819
00:36:36,769 --> 00:36:38,609
The baby's about the size of a cherry.

820
00:36:38,609 --> 00:36:40,010
Arms and legs are growing fast.

821
00:36:40,530 --> 00:36:42,089
Such a tiny thing,

822
00:36:42,370 --> 00:36:43,930
and already giving you trouble.

823
00:36:43,930 --> 00:36:45,169
You need to behave, little one.

824
00:36:45,890 --> 00:36:47,129
Don't bully Mom.

825
00:36:47,530 --> 00:36:49,010
That's right. Or I'll scold you.

826
00:36:50,129 --> 00:36:51,129
Go on, give a smack.

827
00:36:51,129 --> 00:36:52,089
A gentle one.

828
00:36:52,450 --> 00:36:54,330
Just a warning this time.

829
00:36:55,289 --> 00:36:57,010
This app is actually quite professional.

830
00:36:57,330 --> 00:36:58,450
I should study it more.

831
00:36:59,370 --> 00:37:00,370
From now on,

832
00:37:00,370 --> 00:37:02,026
your only job
is to eat, rest, and relax.

833
00:37:02,048 --> 00:37:02,760
Just lie back.

834
00:37:03,050 --> 00:37:03,890
Everything else...

835
00:37:04,289 --> 00:37:04,890
Coming!

836
00:37:06,649 --> 00:37:07,649
Is that my delivery?

837
00:37:10,490 --> 00:37:11,249
Mom's here.

838
00:37:14,649 --> 00:37:15,569
Come in, Mom. Come.

839
00:37:16,330 --> 00:37:16,930
Mom.

840
00:37:17,450 --> 00:37:18,370
What brings you here?

841
00:37:19,649 --> 00:37:21,330
Mom, why didn't you change your shoes?

842
00:37:21,330 --> 00:37:22,569
What's wrong, Grandma?

843
00:37:24,729 --> 00:37:26,569
Mom, your shoes are soaked.

844
00:37:28,450 --> 00:37:29,609
You stepped in a puddle?

845
00:37:43,370 --> 00:37:44,450
Mom, did you catch a chill?

846
00:37:44,649 --> 00:37:45,569
Have some medicine.

847
00:37:47,689 --> 00:37:48,569
Just put it down.

848
00:37:48,609 --> 00:37:50,129
Take Jiao to school first.

849
00:37:50,609 --> 00:37:51,970
She's stuck in the bathroom again.

850
00:37:51,970 --> 00:37:53,370
You know what your daughter's like.

851
00:37:54,129 --> 00:37:56,330
Jiao, hurry up. You'll be late.

852
00:37:57,209 --> 00:37:59,010
Okay, I'm coming.

853
00:37:59,850 --> 00:38:01,410
Mom's shivering again.

854
00:38:02,410 --> 00:38:04,639
Get her some socks.
There are new ones in the drawer.

855
00:38:04,640 --> 00:38:05,915
- Go on, quick.
- Okay.

856
00:38:09,089 --> 00:38:10,050
Here, Mom.

857
00:38:10,050 --> 00:38:11,050
It's done.

858
00:38:12,609 --> 00:38:13,249
Mom.

859
00:38:14,129 --> 00:38:15,490
What's wrong, really?

860
00:38:16,769 --> 00:38:18,010
Don't scare me.

861
00:38:20,089 --> 00:38:21,450
My real daughter

862
00:38:22,769 --> 00:38:23,810
refuses to recognize me.

863
00:38:26,370 --> 00:38:27,769
That fake mother

864
00:38:29,129 --> 00:38:31,010
threw dirty water at me.

865
00:38:32,010 --> 00:38:32,569
Mom.

866
00:38:35,370 --> 00:38:36,609
Mom...

867
00:38:37,450 --> 00:38:38,450
Mom, it's alright.

868
00:38:39,129 --> 00:38:39,890
You're okay, Mom.

869
00:38:43,410 --> 00:38:44,010
Mom.

870
00:38:46,769 --> 00:38:47,729
It's alright.

871
00:38:48,970 --> 00:38:50,850
So your younger daughter
wouldn't accept you,

872
00:38:50,850 --> 00:38:52,569
and that made you anxious, right?

873
00:38:57,129 --> 00:38:59,010
Because she wouldn't acknowledge you,

874
00:38:59,010 --> 00:39:00,810
you often feel uneasy, correct?

875
00:39:02,450 --> 00:39:03,089
Yes.

876
00:39:04,129 --> 00:39:06,010
How about your sleep lately?

877
00:39:06,093 --> 00:39:07,080
- Not good.
- Not good.

878
00:39:07,530 --> 00:39:10,890
I keep having bad dreams all the time.

879
00:39:12,530 --> 00:39:13,810
And your appetite? Eating well?

880
00:39:13,890 --> 00:39:15,115
- Not really.
- Not really.

881
00:39:15,410 --> 00:39:17,530
Nothing tastes good anymore.

882
00:39:19,850 --> 00:39:21,609
Sir, my mom...

883
00:39:23,410 --> 00:39:24,330
She's alright. Not bad.

884
00:39:24,337 --> 00:39:25,530
Overall, she's in good shape.

885
00:39:30,649 --> 00:39:31,649
Mom, sit for a bit.

886
00:39:34,569 --> 00:39:35,410
Listen,

887
00:39:35,810 --> 00:39:36,810
your mother's condition

888
00:39:36,810 --> 00:39:38,810
is moderate anxiety with depression.

889
00:39:39,249 --> 00:39:40,930
It needs early control and treatment.

890
00:39:59,129 --> 00:39:59,729
Zhixia.

891
00:40:00,410 --> 00:40:01,050
Mom.

892
00:40:06,370 --> 00:40:07,129
What happened?

893
00:40:08,810 --> 00:40:09,569
She's depressed.

894
00:40:10,890 --> 00:40:11,850
Truly depressed?

895
00:40:12,249 --> 00:40:12,890
Where's Dad?

896
00:40:16,569 --> 00:40:17,930
Probably not far off either.

897
00:40:33,010 --> 00:40:34,289
Keep an eye on them.

898
00:40:34,289 --> 00:40:35,370
I'll come when I can.

899
00:40:35,370 --> 00:40:35,930
Alright.

900
00:40:36,729 --> 00:40:37,609
About the medicine,

901
00:40:38,289 --> 00:40:39,129
can Dad take it too?

902
00:40:40,010 --> 00:40:41,089
You take it instead.

903
00:40:48,330 --> 00:40:49,569
My birthday's coming.

904
00:40:50,370 --> 00:40:51,569
I've planned it all.

905
00:40:52,129 --> 00:40:54,129
I'll treat everyone to seafood.

906
00:40:54,569 --> 00:40:55,450
Really, Mingzhu?

907
00:40:55,609 --> 00:40:56,249
Really.

908
00:40:57,850 --> 00:40:58,769
What?

909
00:40:58,769 --> 00:41:00,129
Seafood costs a lot.

910
00:41:00,930 --> 00:41:02,370
Buy it home and let your dad cook.

911
00:41:02,689 --> 00:41:04,129
Come on, Mom, don't be so tight.

912
00:41:04,609 --> 00:41:05,289
Exactly.

913
00:41:05,810 --> 00:41:07,129
Dad's cooked all his life.

914
00:41:07,410 --> 00:41:09,010
He should go out and enjoy himself.

915
00:41:09,089 --> 00:41:09,769
That's right.

916
00:41:10,129 --> 00:41:11,010
We're in catering.

917
00:41:11,010 --> 00:41:12,330
We ought to get out more.

918
00:41:12,890 --> 00:41:14,490
You should learn and compare.

919
00:41:15,649 --> 00:41:16,609
He's right.

920
00:41:16,930 --> 00:41:17,970
It's her birthday.

921
00:41:18,050 --> 00:41:19,010
She gets to decide.

922
00:41:20,129 --> 00:41:21,530
We'll go out and try places.

923
00:41:22,289 --> 00:41:22,890
Good.

924
00:41:23,050 --> 00:41:24,530
As long as our girl is happy.

925
00:41:24,769 --> 00:41:25,649
Let's go then.

926
00:41:27,330 --> 00:41:28,930
The weather's nice today.

927
00:41:28,930 --> 00:41:30,689
I'll take you for a walk later.

928
00:41:31,490 --> 00:41:32,450
No need, Mom.

929
00:41:33,050 --> 00:41:36,010
I want to cancel
the wedding photos today.

930
00:41:38,209 --> 00:41:39,330
I'll go cancel them, Mingzhu.

931
00:41:39,569 --> 00:41:41,169
You're the bride, aren't you?

932
00:41:41,890 --> 00:41:43,490
You stay home and do your homework.

933
00:41:45,450 --> 00:41:46,370
I'm heading out then.

934
00:41:47,569 --> 00:41:48,490
Be careful, Mingzhu.

935
00:41:50,930 --> 00:41:52,569
Come back early.

936
00:41:52,930 --> 00:41:53,569
Okay.

937
00:41:56,370 --> 00:41:59,169
Those people won't
keep tailing Mingzhu, will they?

938
00:42:02,249 --> 00:42:03,450
Get me some more rice.

939
00:42:08,330 --> 00:42:09,569

Take it step by step.
