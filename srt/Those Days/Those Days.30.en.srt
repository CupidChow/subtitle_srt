00:01:14,980 --> 00:01:17,980
=Episode 30=

4
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:21,279
Your order is about to expire.

5
00:01:21,279 --> 00:01:22,039
Hello?

6
00:01:22,550 --> 00:01:24,199
Don't be impatient. I'll be there soon.

7
00:01:32,319 --> 00:01:33,399
Say, don't you think our son

8
00:01:34,199 --> 00:01:35,960
is a business genius?

9
00:01:36,160 --> 00:01:37,759
He just did a live stream,

10
00:01:37,919 --> 00:01:39,360
and he sold out all 100

11
00:01:39,800 --> 00:01:40,679
of our lunch boxes.

12
00:01:40,679 --> 00:01:41,759
Stop gloating already.

13
00:01:42,559 --> 00:01:43,679
If your son is that capable,

14
00:01:44,810 --> 00:01:47,039
if he's that talented,
you should tell him to come back

15
00:01:47,039 --> 00:01:48,240
and inherit your business.

16
00:01:48,250 --> 00:01:49,440
This way, we won't need to work so hard.

17
00:01:49,440 --> 00:01:50,479
What kind of joke is that?

18
00:01:50,479 --> 00:01:52,479
My son will study in
a prestigious university.

19
00:01:52,479 --> 00:01:54,310
How can you consider this
a family business?

20
00:01:54,479 --> 00:01:55,520
The scale is too small.

21
00:01:58,240 --> 00:01:59,919
You have received a new order.

22
00:02:02,360 --> 00:02:03,360
Hurry and switch it off.

23
00:02:03,479 --> 00:02:04,679
I'm already out of pork chops.

24
00:02:05,240 --> 00:02:05,839
What?

25
00:02:11,160 --> 00:02:11,950
Class is in session.

26
00:02:12,040 --> 00:02:12,760
Stand up.

27
00:02:14,879 --> 00:02:16,240
- Shen!
- Shen!

28
00:02:18,279 --> 00:02:19,159
Thank you, everyone.

29
00:02:19,360 --> 00:02:20,679
Thank you, everyone.

30
00:02:21,159 --> 00:02:21,879
Let me say this.

31
00:02:22,760 --> 00:02:24,439
Dear top students,

32
00:02:24,960 --> 00:02:27,350
please don't forget to hold
your celebration at Shen's Restaurant

33
00:02:27,439 --> 00:02:29,800
when you make it in the future.

34
00:02:30,200 --> 00:02:31,879
- Okay!
- Okay!

35
00:02:31,879 --> 00:02:34,200
I'll wait for you all
at the prestigious universities.

36
00:02:34,200 --> 00:02:36,060
- Alright.
- Alright. We'll wait for you too.

37
00:02:37,240 --> 00:02:38,320
We'll wait for you too.

38
00:02:38,320 --> 00:02:38,879
Excellent!

39
00:02:38,879 --> 00:02:39,950
Remember to give us a discount.

40
00:02:43,640 --> 00:02:44,279
This is for you.

41
00:02:44,279 --> 00:02:47,119
- I want one too!
- I want one too!

42
00:02:47,200 --> 00:02:48,599
Please keep a low profile.

43
00:02:48,719 --> 00:02:50,520
Hold your celebration
at Shen's Restaurant,

44
00:02:50,599 --> 00:02:52,080
and each of you will get one.

45
00:02:52,080 --> 00:02:53,360
- I want one too!
- I want one too!

46
00:02:53,360 --> 00:02:54,250
Will you give us a discount?

47
00:02:57,760 --> 00:02:58,279
Mingzhu.

48
00:02:58,279 --> 00:02:58,999
Where are you going?

49
00:02:58,999 --> 00:03:01,080
Great. Keep Mom company this afternoon.

50
00:03:01,200 --> 00:03:02,200
I need to head to Lijun.

51
00:03:02,960 --> 00:03:04,080
But why?

52
00:03:04,660 --> 00:03:05,550
To take back my money.

53
00:03:06,620 --> 00:03:08,599
Dad topped up 100,000 yuan
in my card before this.

54
00:03:08,599 --> 00:03:10,260
And, I quit without
taking my commission.

55
00:03:10,279 --> 00:03:11,250
I'll try to ask for it.

56
00:03:11,360 --> 00:03:12,520
You quit a long time ago.

57
00:03:12,520 --> 00:03:13,640
Can you even get it back?

58
00:03:13,640 --> 00:03:14,920
I should at least give it a try.

59
00:03:14,920 --> 00:03:16,360
Youngsters should try everything.

60
00:03:17,439 --> 00:03:18,279
That's what Dad said.

61
00:03:22,080 --> 00:03:22,719
Go now.

62
00:03:22,719 --> 00:03:23,320
See you.

63
00:03:27,960 --> 00:03:28,640
Your commission?

64
00:03:31,460 --> 00:03:32,599
Meiqi, I'm being honest here.

65
00:03:32,599 --> 00:03:34,839
I rarely encounter a situation as such.

66
00:03:35,520 --> 00:03:36,480
I can only help you

67
00:03:36,480 --> 00:03:38,119
inquire about it from the HR Department.

68
00:03:39,360 --> 00:03:40,360
Thank you, Samantha.

69
00:03:41,999 --> 00:03:42,999
Sorry for the trouble.

70
00:03:47,040 --> 00:03:48,119
How have you been lately?

71
00:03:51,080 --> 00:03:51,839
Terrible.

72
00:03:54,119 --> 00:03:55,559
A lot has happened at home.

73
00:03:56,360 --> 00:03:58,119
It's a total mess. It's terrible.

74
00:04:01,719 --> 00:04:03,040
Sorry, Samantha.

75
00:04:04,119 --> 00:04:07,480
I didn't cherish this job before this.

76
00:04:08,360 --> 00:04:09,679
Back then,

77
00:04:10,279 --> 00:04:12,360
I thought it was boring to go to work.

78
00:04:12,370 --> 00:04:14,660
It was even more boring
when I had to hit the stupid KPI.

79
00:04:15,559 --> 00:04:16,960
But now that I think about it,

80
00:04:19,239 --> 00:04:21,239
I think I led
a pampered life before this.

81
00:04:23,719 --> 00:04:24,440
Meiqi.

82
00:04:26,080 --> 00:04:27,640
It feels like you've matured a lot.

83
00:04:29,680 --> 00:04:30,919
I think so too.

84
00:04:32,520 --> 00:04:33,760
I also want to ask you this.

85
00:04:35,160 --> 00:04:37,150
Does the Marketing Department
still need manpower?

86
00:04:38,080 --> 00:04:39,359
Can you give me another chance?

87
00:04:39,359 --> 00:04:40,440
I'll surely do my best.

88
00:04:41,680 --> 00:04:42,359
No, we can't.

89
00:04:42,960 --> 00:04:44,120
We already hired someone new.

90
00:04:48,200 --> 00:04:50,420
If so, can you consider me
if there's a vacant position

91
00:04:50,760 --> 00:04:52,260
that you think it's suitable for me?

92
00:04:57,760 --> 00:04:58,359
Sure.

93
00:05:04,159 --> 00:05:04,839
Thank you.

94
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:06,640
Song.

95
00:05:07,120 --> 00:05:07,839
Mr. Wu.

96
00:05:08,039 --> 00:05:10,340
Have you finished the recruitment
proposal I asked you to prepare?

97
00:05:10,359 --> 00:05:11,000
Yeah.

98
00:05:11,010 --> 00:05:12,039
Show it to me in my office.

99
00:05:12,039 --> 00:05:12,599
Okay.

100
00:05:17,260 --> 00:05:19,100
(Superior)

101
00:05:23,239 --> 00:05:23,799
Hello?

102
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:25,450
Is the result for the selection out?

103
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:28,680
Wu was selected.

104
00:05:29,140 --> 00:05:30,159
Didn't I tell you already?

105
00:05:30,159 --> 00:05:31,110
The result was determined internally.

106
00:05:31,120 --> 00:05:32,120
My foot.

107
00:05:32,719 --> 00:05:34,130
My friend already told me about it.

108
00:05:34,320 --> 00:05:36,479
Your overall evaluation score
was the highest, right?

109
00:05:44,919 --> 00:05:46,120
So, you found out, huh?

110
00:05:46,120 --> 00:05:47,479
Why are you asking me, then?

111
00:05:47,560 --> 00:05:48,599
Zhang Hao, listen.

112
00:05:49,839 --> 00:05:51,399
The only reason you weren't selected

113
00:05:51,399 --> 00:05:52,839
was because your superiors

114
00:05:52,839 --> 00:05:54,100
thought you were too laid-back.

115
00:05:54,719 --> 00:05:56,680
A HOD has to lead the pack
and charge ahead.

116
00:05:56,680 --> 00:05:57,960
I'm sure you would've been selected

117
00:05:57,960 --> 00:05:59,680
if you were more proactive.

118
00:05:59,680 --> 00:06:01,430
Can you please stop
jumping to conclusions?

119
00:06:02,490 --> 00:06:03,839
What's the point of telling me off

120
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:04,810
after the selection?

121
00:06:05,160 --> 00:06:07,320
When I said I wanted
to participate in the selection,

122
00:06:07,320 --> 00:06:09,039
someone patted their chest

123
00:06:09,060 --> 00:06:10,640
and assured that she could help me out.

124
00:06:10,799 --> 00:06:12,359
But now, the only one who could help me

125
00:06:12,359 --> 00:06:14,039
is trying to blame me for everything.

126
00:06:14,320 --> 00:06:14,960
Zhang Hao,

127
00:06:15,520 --> 00:06:16,599
what did you mean by that?

128
00:06:18,039 --> 00:06:19,719
This family isn't mine alone.

129
00:06:19,960 --> 00:06:21,919
What's the point of me
striving to be better alone?

130
00:06:21,919 --> 00:06:22,560
Fine!

131
00:06:22,760 --> 00:06:23,880
The family isn't yours alone.

132
00:06:24,080 --> 00:06:25,000
It's my fault.

133
00:06:25,159 --> 00:06:27,080
Ms. Xu Zhixia,

134
00:06:27,799 --> 00:06:29,760
lying flat is the only thing I know.

135
00:06:29,760 --> 00:06:30,839
And, it's the only thing I'm best at.

136
00:06:30,839 --> 00:06:32,799
I was already lying flat
on the first day you knew me.

137
00:06:32,799 --> 00:06:34,799
Now, I'm going
to prepare for that, okay?

138
00:06:35,760 --> 00:06:36,479
Zhang Hao!

139
00:06:55,500 --> 00:07:00,580
(Congratulations. Wu Yuhui has been
appointed as the HR Department HOD)

140
00:07:03,560 --> 00:07:04,159
Mom.

141
00:07:04,880 --> 00:07:06,760
Did you argue with Dad?

142
00:07:08,039 --> 00:07:09,760
That's not true.

143
00:07:09,760 --> 00:07:11,640
If so, why are you sleeping with me?

144
00:07:12,520 --> 00:07:14,359
It's because you're my baby girl.

145
00:07:17,960 --> 00:07:19,320
But I have no space to sleep.

146
00:07:21,039 --> 00:07:21,680
Is that so?

147
00:07:22,359 --> 00:07:24,560
Your bed is huge.
How could there be no space?

148
00:07:25,719 --> 00:07:27,039
I think I have no space.

149
00:07:32,159 --> 00:07:32,799
Jiao,

150
00:07:34,279 --> 00:07:35,120
when you grow up,

151
00:07:35,120 --> 00:07:36,599
you'll get married too.

152
00:07:36,599 --> 00:07:37,919
And, you'll have your own children.

153
00:07:37,919 --> 00:07:40,640
By then, you won't get the chance
to sleep beside me again.

154
00:07:40,640 --> 00:07:43,359
Therefore, you have
to cherish this opportunity, okay?

155
00:07:45,399 --> 00:07:46,080
Mom,

156
00:07:47,159 --> 00:07:48,839
will you get a divorce from Dad?

157
00:07:50,479 --> 00:07:51,080
No.

158
00:07:52,200 --> 00:07:52,880
No, I won't.

159
00:07:52,919 --> 00:07:54,680
If so, you should return to your room.

160
00:07:55,120 --> 00:07:56,719
I need my own space.

161
00:07:57,520 --> 00:07:59,359
If not, I won't have my personal space

162
00:07:59,360 --> 00:08:01,520
after I get married
and have children in the future.

163
00:08:03,880 --> 00:08:04,880
No, Jiao.

164
00:08:05,200 --> 00:08:06,359
Listen.

165
00:08:06,719 --> 00:08:08,880
No matter when it is,

166
00:08:08,880 --> 00:08:10,560
we women can lead our own lives.

167
00:08:10,799 --> 00:08:12,399
We can have our own space.

168
00:08:14,340 --> 00:08:15,640
Mom, do you have your own space?

169
00:08:18,220 --> 00:08:19,279
You should hurry and sleep.

170
00:08:19,279 --> 00:08:20,520
I'll have my own space
when you're asleep.

171
00:08:20,520 --> 00:08:21,120
Go to sleep.

172
00:08:43,960 --> 00:08:44,999
I know I'm lying flat.

173
00:08:45,479 --> 00:08:46,280
It's my fault.

174
00:08:48,280 --> 00:08:49,040
It's my fault.

175
00:08:51,359 --> 00:08:52,519
I hate myself.

176
00:08:53,290 --> 00:08:55,479
I hate myself for not being able
to buy a bigger house.

177
00:08:55,480 --> 00:08:57,359
I don't have anywhere else to go
after arguing with you.

178
00:08:58,359 --> 00:09:00,800
Secondly, I hate myself
for being a bad example for Jiao.

179
00:09:01,680 --> 00:09:02,750
Do you know how old she is?

180
00:09:04,040 --> 00:09:05,160
She actually believed

181
00:09:05,599 --> 00:09:07,359
that marriage was the end of self.

182
00:09:07,460 --> 00:09:08,519
What about the third point?

183
00:09:10,520 --> 00:09:12,040
Thirdly, I hate myself for being too old

184
00:09:12,040 --> 00:09:13,950
to get another husband
without any consequences.

185
00:09:17,359 --> 00:09:17,960
Wait.

186
00:09:20,280 --> 00:09:21,040
Let's eat.

187
00:09:22,960 --> 00:09:24,160
Mom made that for me.

188
00:09:24,160 --> 00:09:25,280
You're not allowed to eat it.

189
00:09:25,479 --> 00:09:26,639
Fine. You can have it all.

190
00:09:28,960 --> 00:09:29,800
Mom, you're back.

191
00:09:30,920 --> 00:09:33,440
The marketplace was so crowded today.

192
00:09:33,440 --> 00:09:33,960
Yeah, right?

193
00:09:34,200 --> 00:09:35,960
I was thinking that you guys

194
00:09:35,960 --> 00:09:37,960
would be sending Jiao
to her piano lessons by now.

195
00:09:38,719 --> 00:09:39,879
And, I was passing by.

196
00:09:39,879 --> 00:09:41,670
That's why I'm here
to deliver some things to you two.

197
00:09:41,680 --> 00:09:42,320
Mom,

198
00:09:42,479 --> 00:09:44,280
Jiao is having online lessons now.

199
00:09:44,440 --> 00:09:46,320
Now, we can take a nap on weekends.

200
00:09:47,080 --> 00:09:47,960
Have you taken lunch?

201
00:09:47,960 --> 00:09:48,879
Why don't you join us?

202
00:09:50,200 --> 00:09:50,879
Zhang Hao.

203
00:09:52,560 --> 00:09:53,200
Zhang Hao!

204
00:09:58,960 --> 00:10:00,430
Didn't you borrow money from me because

205
00:10:00,440 --> 00:10:02,800
you needed to pay for
Jiao's piano lessons?

206
00:10:04,400 --> 00:10:05,080
Zhang Hao.

207
00:10:05,960 --> 00:10:08,719
Don't tell me you couldn't even afford
to pay half of her piano fees.

208
00:10:08,719 --> 00:10:09,950
Did you actually borrow money from Mom?

209
00:10:11,440 --> 00:10:12,599
Where did all your money go?

210
00:10:12,599 --> 00:10:13,910
What did you spend your money on?

211
00:10:17,280 --> 00:10:18,400
Zhang Hao, listen up.

212
00:10:18,639 --> 00:10:20,160
You own a family.

213
00:10:20,160 --> 00:10:21,770
You mustn't stray from the right path.

214
00:10:22,280 --> 00:10:23,320
That's not it.

215
00:10:25,680 --> 00:10:26,280
Mom.

216
00:10:27,719 --> 00:10:29,960
I didn't know Zhang Hao
borrowed the money from you.

217
00:10:30,200 --> 00:10:31,400
I lent the money to my sister.

218
00:10:31,400 --> 00:10:32,960
Her mother-in-law
had a brain hemorrhage.

219
00:10:32,960 --> 00:10:33,950
She's in the ER as we speak.

220
00:10:37,280 --> 00:10:38,440
I used it to help her sister.

221
00:10:40,060 --> 00:10:40,950
I helped her sister.

222
00:10:40,960 --> 00:10:42,400
What did you tell me?

223
00:10:42,410 --> 00:10:43,960
Didn't you say the money
was meant for a specific purpose?

224
00:10:43,960 --> 00:10:45,560
You lied to me!

225
00:10:46,160 --> 00:10:47,040
It was urgent.

226
00:10:47,040 --> 00:10:48,200
So what?

227
00:10:50,759 --> 00:10:51,320
Zhixia,

228
00:10:52,519 --> 00:10:54,719
I know you're
the eldest child of the family.

229
00:10:55,160 --> 00:10:56,560
But your siblings

230
00:10:56,560 --> 00:10:58,479
have all grown up.

231
00:10:58,839 --> 00:10:59,440
Am I right?

232
00:10:59,440 --> 00:11:01,839
You own a family as well.

233
00:11:02,080 --> 00:11:03,770
Shouldn't there be a limit

234
00:11:03,770 --> 00:11:05,599
when it comes to helping
your maternal family?

235
00:11:05,599 --> 00:11:06,400
She understands.

236
00:11:06,400 --> 00:11:07,839
What? I haven't finished my words yet!

237
00:11:07,839 --> 00:11:09,300
Yeah, there should be a limit to it.

238
00:11:09,320 --> 00:11:09,759
Mom,

239
00:11:09,759 --> 00:11:12,040
they needed the money
to save her mother-in-law.

240
00:11:14,200 --> 00:11:16,280
You're our daughter-in-law now.

241
00:11:16,280 --> 00:11:17,800
My sister was helping
her mother-in-law out.

242
00:11:17,800 --> 00:11:19,610
She's a role model
for all daughters-in-law.

243
00:11:19,960 --> 00:11:21,080
You got me.

244
00:11:21,839 --> 00:11:22,440
Fine.

245
00:11:22,440 --> 00:11:23,960
I'll say this now.

246
00:11:23,960 --> 00:11:24,759
If, one day,

247
00:11:24,759 --> 00:11:26,519
I'm in the ICU...

248
00:11:26,639 --> 00:11:27,080
Hey.

249
00:11:27,080 --> 00:11:28,160
Do not save me!

250
00:11:28,160 --> 00:11:30,440
Do not borrow money to save me!

251
00:11:30,440 --> 00:11:31,080
Mom, I'm sorry.

252
00:11:31,080 --> 00:11:32,560
I cannot fulfill your request.

253
00:11:35,390 --> 00:11:36,320
Perhaps I'm not suitable

254
00:11:36,320 --> 00:11:37,950
to be the daughter-in-law
of the Zhang family.

255
00:11:38,960 --> 00:11:39,639
Zhang Hao, we...

256
00:11:40,080 --> 00:11:41,320
Why don't we get a divorce?

257
00:11:41,320 --> 00:11:42,560
Zhixia, what are you doing?

258
00:11:42,560 --> 00:11:43,479
Why did you say that?

259
00:11:43,479 --> 00:11:44,440
What divorce?

260
00:11:44,560 --> 00:11:45,639
You're pregnant, you know?

261
00:11:45,639 --> 00:11:47,440
How can I get a divorce from you?

262
00:11:47,440 --> 00:11:48,599
Yeah. According to the law,

263
00:11:48,599 --> 00:11:50,119
you cannot get a divorce from me
since I'm pregnant.

264
00:11:50,119 --> 00:11:51,999
But I can get a divorce from you.

265
00:11:51,999 --> 00:11:53,320
Hey, you...

266
00:11:53,320 --> 00:11:53,999
Mom.

267
00:12:14,239 --> 00:12:14,879
Meiqi.

268
00:12:15,730 --> 00:12:17,639
They reduced
the Mannitol dosage for Mom today.

269
00:12:17,660 --> 00:12:19,280
It seems her condition
has gotten better.

270
00:12:19,400 --> 00:12:19,999
Really?

271
00:12:22,239 --> 00:12:22,839
Mingzhu.

272
00:12:24,119 --> 00:12:25,150
Here's your pork rib soup.

273
00:12:25,560 --> 00:12:27,200
I was planning to take it anyway.

274
00:12:27,360 --> 00:12:28,400
Mom shouldn't have done so.

275
00:12:28,400 --> 00:12:30,320
She shouldn't ask you to deliver it
when you're busy with your studies.

276
00:12:30,320 --> 00:12:32,160
No problem. It's a piece of cake.

277
00:12:32,680 --> 00:12:33,759
Thank you, Minghui.

278
00:12:34,239 --> 00:12:35,359
You should thank Mingzhu.

279
00:12:35,839 --> 00:12:37,080
I only did it for her sake.

280
00:12:37,400 --> 00:12:38,599
You can shut up now.

281
00:12:41,479 --> 00:12:42,119
Meiqi,

282
00:12:42,440 --> 00:12:43,960
go and heat this lunch box.

283
00:12:43,970 --> 00:12:45,359
Feed her some soup when she wakes up.

284
00:12:45,359 --> 00:12:45,879
Okay.

285
00:12:52,519 --> 00:12:53,440
Help me see

286
00:12:53,440 --> 00:12:55,080
if it's the adult diaper seller.

287
00:12:55,080 --> 00:12:55,639
Okay.

288
00:13:03,400 --> 00:13:04,040
Who is it?

289
00:13:05,639 --> 00:13:06,599
Mingzhu, who is this?

290
00:13:07,879 --> 00:13:08,680
(Shen Mingzhu.)

291
00:13:09,040 --> 00:13:10,560
(I'll go to your house tonight.)

292
00:13:10,759 --> 00:13:13,200
(We need to talk things through
regarding the inheritance.)

293
00:13:18,160 --> 00:13:19,950
Mingzhu, whose inheritance
are you guys talking about?

294
00:13:20,680 --> 00:13:22,280
Don't tell Feng Meiqi about this.

295
00:13:22,560 --> 00:13:23,280
But why?

296
00:13:23,920 --> 00:13:25,879
Just don't tell her. Don't ask me why.

297
00:13:26,719 --> 00:13:27,759
If you don't tell me why,

298
00:13:27,759 --> 00:13:28,960
I'll ask Feng Meiqi right now.

299
00:13:28,960 --> 00:13:29,920
Come back!

300
00:13:33,920 --> 00:13:35,839
My father-in-law had
an illegitimate son.

301
00:13:36,530 --> 00:13:38,119
His mom wants to
discuss this with us.

302
00:13:40,040 --> 00:13:40,639
Mingzhu,

303
00:13:41,080 --> 00:13:42,839
what kind of family have you joined?

304
00:13:45,239 --> 00:13:46,359
Are you free later?

305
00:13:47,359 --> 00:13:47,920
I'm free.

306
00:13:47,920 --> 00:13:49,200
If so, I'll assign you a task.

307
00:13:49,560 --> 00:13:51,359
Keep an eye on Meiqi for me.

308
00:13:51,519 --> 00:13:52,960
Don't let her go home.

309
00:13:52,960 --> 00:13:53,759
Got it?

310
00:13:54,040 --> 00:13:55,280
My mother-in-law fainted

311
00:13:55,280 --> 00:13:56,280
because of that woman.

312
00:13:56,310 --> 00:13:58,230
I'm worried that Meiqi
might not be able to take it.

313
00:13:58,839 --> 00:13:59,560
Got it.

314
00:14:10,580 --> 00:14:11,519
Keep a close eye on her.

315
00:14:11,639 --> 00:14:12,440
Got it.

316
00:14:17,800 --> 00:14:18,400
Minghui.

317
00:14:18,879 --> 00:14:20,839
Here. Someone in
the pantry gave this to me.

318
00:14:22,080 --> 00:14:22,759
Just take it.

319
00:14:28,500 --> 00:14:32,820
(Nanzhou New District People's Court,
Sealed Off)

320
00:14:49,920 --> 00:14:50,680
You're back.

321
00:14:53,760 --> 00:14:55,040
How did you manage to come here?

322
00:14:56,040 --> 00:14:57,160
The security guard let me in.

323
00:14:57,560 --> 00:14:59,080
I said I was a good friend of Mr. Feng.

324
00:14:59,090 --> 00:15:00,960
You shouldn't introduce yourself
to the people here.

325
00:15:00,960 --> 00:15:02,320
We know everyone here.

326
00:15:02,719 --> 00:15:04,359
Even if you aren't embarrassed, we are.

327
00:15:05,060 --> 00:15:07,390
You're still worried about that
when your house is already sealed off?

328
00:15:17,400 --> 00:15:18,210
Where are you going?

329
00:15:18,639 --> 00:15:19,639
Why are you still here?

330
00:15:19,639 --> 00:15:20,570
The sun has already set.

331
00:15:21,560 --> 00:15:23,610
Mingzhu was afraid
that you couldn't cope here.

332
00:15:23,650 --> 00:15:24,920
She told me to keep you company.

333
00:15:25,060 --> 00:15:26,920
I can't cope with the situation
with you around.

334
00:15:27,080 --> 00:15:27,920
You should head back.

335
00:15:27,920 --> 00:15:28,950
Don't you have school tomorrow?

336
00:15:29,119 --> 00:15:30,080
Don't bring that up.

337
00:15:30,320 --> 00:15:31,040
I'm just like you.

338
00:15:31,040 --> 00:15:32,250
I don't want to see Hu Gang either.

339
00:15:35,160 --> 00:15:37,080
If you're staying,

340
00:15:37,080 --> 00:15:38,239
look after my mom for me.

341
00:15:38,239 --> 00:15:39,310
I need to head back and take a bath.

342
00:15:39,400 --> 00:15:40,719
No. You mustn't leave.

343
00:15:40,719 --> 00:15:41,359
But why?

344
00:15:42,759 --> 00:15:43,479
If you leave now,

345
00:15:44,320 --> 00:15:45,440
I cannot face Mingzhu

346
00:15:45,879 --> 00:15:47,400
if something happens to your mom.

347
00:15:52,599 --> 00:15:53,239
What?

348
00:15:54,639 --> 00:15:55,560
Be honest with me.

349
00:15:56,080 --> 00:15:57,719
Is something going on at my house?

350
00:15:58,200 --> 00:16:01,040
No. Don't worry about it.

351
00:16:01,759 --> 00:16:02,359
Tell me.

352
00:16:02,599 --> 00:16:03,320
I'm serious.

353
00:16:03,320 --> 00:16:03,960
Tell me!

354
00:16:08,160 --> 00:16:10,160
Don't tell her that I told you.

355
00:16:12,239 --> 00:16:13,719
You won't get a share of this house.

356
00:16:14,479 --> 00:16:15,479
It's under my name.

357
00:16:16,360 --> 00:16:18,080
You already
saw the opposite unit yourself.

358
00:16:18,080 --> 00:16:19,479
It's already sealed off.

359
00:16:19,479 --> 00:16:20,999
The factory has been seized as well.

360
00:16:21,480 --> 00:16:24,119
We'll repay the bank first and
the debtors after we auction it off.

361
00:16:24,960 --> 00:16:27,599
My mother-in-law is currently
hospitalized with a brain hemorrhage.

362
00:16:28,479 --> 00:16:29,920
We need a lot of money.

363
00:16:30,440 --> 00:16:32,599
We've already borrowed money
from everyone we know.

364
00:16:33,999 --> 00:16:36,479
I tremble whenever
I hear my phone ringing.

365
00:16:37,080 --> 00:16:39,400
I'm worried that the hospital
might deliver bad news to us.

366
00:16:39,760 --> 00:16:41,879
It's either that or they'll urge us
to pay the hospital bill.

367
00:16:44,719 --> 00:16:45,800
My mother-in-law fainted

368
00:16:46,719 --> 00:16:47,920
all because of you.

369
00:16:47,920 --> 00:16:49,310
Let me interrupt you for a second.

370
00:16:50,239 --> 00:16:52,839
Wasn't it because of your father-in-law?

371
00:16:53,800 --> 00:16:55,239
It takes two to tango, you know?

372
00:16:55,239 --> 00:16:56,920
Everyone is responsible for this.

373
00:16:57,460 --> 00:16:59,200
I've been together with Feng
for many years.

374
00:16:59,560 --> 00:17:01,479
I never requested him
to get a divorce at all.

375
00:17:01,479 --> 00:17:02,920
Don't you think I'm a kind mistress?

376
00:17:02,980 --> 00:17:03,920
How dare you say that?

377
00:17:05,999 --> 00:17:07,279
Why are you looking for me, then?

378
00:17:07,680 --> 00:17:08,920
You're still here for the money.

379
00:17:08,920 --> 00:17:10,319
It's not for me.

380
00:17:11,279 --> 00:17:13,120
It's for Feng's son.

381
00:17:13,960 --> 00:17:14,960
Logically speaking,

382
00:17:14,960 --> 00:17:16,960
we should get a cut
of Feng's inheritance.

383
00:17:17,580 --> 00:17:18,640
Don't tell me things like

384
00:17:18,640 --> 00:17:19,600
the house and the factory are seized.

385
00:17:19,600 --> 00:17:20,960
That has nothing to do with me.

386
00:17:21,060 --> 00:17:23,250
I'm only concerned about
the things that are related to me.

387
00:17:24,590 --> 00:17:26,600
I know that Feng bought
a life insurance policy.

388
00:17:28,120 --> 00:17:29,600
Don't even think about it.

389
00:17:30,440 --> 00:17:31,440
You're still healthy.

390
00:17:31,440 --> 00:17:33,020
My mother-in-law
is lying in the hospital.

391
00:17:33,030 --> 00:17:34,719
We have to pay
all kinds of medical bills.

392
00:17:34,760 --> 00:17:36,559
And, her treatments will
require a lot of money as well.

393
00:17:36,559 --> 00:17:37,920
Is it that serious?

394
00:17:38,640 --> 00:17:40,319
I think Mrs. Feng was too pampered.

395
00:17:40,319 --> 00:17:41,950
That's why she couldn't
endure any hardships.

396
00:17:41,960 --> 00:17:42,640
I would've crawled out

397
00:17:42,640 --> 00:17:44,039
from the hospital bed had I known

398
00:17:44,039 --> 00:17:45,640
the medical bills would be that high.

399
00:17:45,640 --> 00:17:47,840
How could you say something like that
at such a moment?

400
00:17:52,120 --> 00:17:53,600
Why not take us to court, then?

401
00:17:54,719 --> 00:17:56,640
We've received plenty
of summons already anyway.

402
00:17:56,650 --> 00:17:57,950
Having one more doesn't matter.

403
00:18:02,719 --> 00:18:03,600
Listen.

404
00:18:04,120 --> 00:18:05,360
You'd better not challenge me.

405
00:18:07,880 --> 00:18:08,479
Hey.

406
00:18:08,490 --> 00:18:09,880
How could you be this shameless?

407
00:18:10,110 --> 00:18:10,999
What's wrong with you?

408
00:18:10,999 --> 00:18:12,479
My mom almost died because of you.

409
00:18:12,600 --> 00:18:14,519
Why did you bring her back?

410
00:18:16,600 --> 00:18:17,160
Scram.

411
00:18:18,719 --> 00:18:19,319
Scram!

412
00:18:25,060 --> 00:18:26,079
Do you have a death wish?

413
00:18:26,079 --> 00:18:26,479
Meiqi!

414
00:18:26,479 --> 00:18:27,950
- What are you doing?
- You want to die, huh?

415
00:18:27,960 --> 00:18:29,079
Meiqi!

416
00:18:29,079 --> 00:18:30,239
Listen up! You'd better let go!

417
00:18:30,239 --> 00:18:30,999
I'll beat you to death!

418
00:18:30,999 --> 00:18:31,999
Stop it!

419
00:18:31,999 --> 00:18:33,479
Stop fighting!

420
00:18:34,319 --> 00:18:35,999
Stop fighting!

421
00:18:35,999 --> 00:18:36,519
Get out of the way!

422
00:18:36,519 --> 00:18:37,079
Stop!

423
00:18:37,840 --> 00:18:38,640
Stop fighting!

424
00:18:39,479 --> 00:18:40,440
Stop fighting!

425
00:18:40,559 --> 00:18:41,680
If not, I'll call the cops!

426
00:18:41,680 --> 00:18:42,600
Stop it!

427
00:18:53,840 --> 00:18:54,799
Just you guys wait.

428
00:18:54,800 --> 00:18:55,840
I won't let you guys off!

429
00:18:56,360 --> 00:18:57,039
Scram!

430
00:19:04,719 --> 00:19:05,479
Shen Minghui,

431
00:19:06,239 --> 00:19:07,239
tell me what's going on.

432
00:19:07,960 --> 00:19:09,440
Meiqi insisted on
coming back for a bath.

433
00:19:09,440 --> 00:19:10,600
It's not Minghui's fault.

434
00:19:10,999 --> 00:19:12,660
I came back to chase the mistress away.

435
00:19:13,140 --> 00:19:14,920
Why didn't you tell me
that Ding Hong was coming?

436
00:19:14,960 --> 00:19:16,440
How dare she try to steal
our inheritance?

437
00:19:16,440 --> 00:19:17,360
She doesn't deserve it!

438
00:19:17,719 --> 00:19:19,360
There's no more inheritance left anyway!

439
00:19:19,360 --> 00:19:20,799
She's the reason
our family is in a mess!

440
00:19:20,799 --> 00:19:21,719
Are you sure it was her fault?

441
00:19:21,719 --> 00:19:23,479
Or was it your dad's fault?

442
00:19:26,319 --> 00:19:27,799
Mom is all alone in the hospital!

443
00:19:27,799 --> 00:19:28,799
How could you come back?

444
00:19:32,510 --> 00:19:34,479
I hired Mrs. Wang,
the caretaker of the next ward

445
00:19:34,479 --> 00:19:35,400
to look after her.

446
00:19:35,400 --> 00:19:36,360
Who's paying for it?

447
00:19:43,239 --> 00:19:44,079
Go and take a bath.

448
00:19:44,360 --> 00:19:46,160
Hurry and return to
the hospital after that!

449
00:19:58,560 --> 00:19:59,519
Mingzhu, it's my fault.

450
00:19:59,920 --> 00:20:01,960
Can't you even keep an eye on her?

451
00:20:02,279 --> 00:20:04,279
Do you think this mess
isn't big enough for us?

452
00:20:04,719 --> 00:20:05,999
I just think that...

453
00:20:07,079 --> 00:20:07,719
I'm sorry.

454
00:20:08,079 --> 00:20:08,600
Scram!

455
00:20:15,160 --> 00:20:15,840
Come back.

456
00:20:32,400 --> 00:20:32,999
Go home.

457
00:20:58,680 --> 00:21:00,200
She was brutal.

458
00:22:14,239 --> 00:22:14,920
Jiao,

459
00:22:15,640 --> 00:22:16,640
what are you doing?

460
00:22:16,660 --> 00:22:18,200
I'm squeezing toothpaste for you two.

461
00:22:18,640 --> 00:22:20,840
You and Dad slept late last night.

462
00:22:21,120 --> 00:22:22,360
You guys should sleep longer.

463
00:22:25,600 --> 00:22:27,120
We're grown-ups.

464
00:22:27,600 --> 00:22:29,479
We can do this by ourselves.

465
00:22:29,840 --> 00:22:30,479
Okay.

466
00:22:30,519 --> 00:22:31,999
I'll go and wake Dad, then.

467
00:22:36,600 --> 00:22:38,319
Lazy bug, time to wake up.

468
00:22:38,999 --> 00:22:40,079
Lazy bug, time to wake up.

469
00:22:40,440 --> 00:22:41,440
Wake up!

470
00:22:41,440 --> 00:22:43,079
I can't hear you.

471
00:22:43,079 --> 00:22:44,160
Wake up!

472
00:22:44,160 --> 00:22:45,120
That's ticklish!

473
00:22:45,559 --> 00:22:46,799
Stop it!

474
00:22:46,799 --> 00:22:48,239
Dad, hurry and wake up.

475
00:22:48,600 --> 00:22:50,600
Mom has already filled up
your toothbrush cup.

476
00:22:50,600 --> 00:22:51,950
She also put toothpaste
on your toothbrush.

477
00:22:53,840 --> 00:22:54,519
Really?

478
00:23:00,239 --> 00:23:01,039
That's amazing.

479
00:23:12,440 --> 00:23:13,160
Thank you.

480
00:23:16,200 --> 00:23:17,279
Jiao did it.

481
00:23:20,160 --> 00:23:21,239
Jiao has become sensible.

482
00:23:23,039 --> 00:23:24,920
I don't want my daughter
to be so sensible.

483
00:23:26,760 --> 00:23:27,999
When a child is this sensible,

484
00:23:30,600 --> 00:23:31,999
it means the family is in trouble.

485
00:23:51,160 --> 00:23:51,600
Mom,

486
00:23:51,719 --> 00:23:53,200
I'll heat the milk for you.

487
00:23:57,440 --> 00:23:58,200
Miss Shen,

488
00:23:59,880 --> 00:24:01,680
Dr. Wang has a message for you.

489
00:24:01,880 --> 00:24:04,519
Right now is the golden period
for your mom's recovery.

490
00:24:04,519 --> 00:24:06,039
Rehabilitation training is required.

491
00:24:06,719 --> 00:24:08,319
But it'll be quite expensive.

492
00:24:08,440 --> 00:24:09,719
We hope you can consider it.

493
00:24:10,719 --> 00:24:11,279
Okay.

494
00:24:31,280 --> 00:24:32,640
Contact us anytime if you need anything.

495
00:24:32,640 --> 00:24:33,200
Okay.

496
00:24:33,200 --> 00:24:33,799
Goodbye.

497
00:24:41,440 --> 00:24:42,360
Hello, Mingzhu.

498
00:24:42,840 --> 00:24:43,680
Hello, Ni.

499
00:24:44,719 --> 00:24:45,960
How is your mother-in-law doing?

500
00:24:46,920 --> 00:24:47,719
Not too good.

501
00:24:48,319 --> 00:24:49,759
She's still bedridden.

502
00:24:50,039 --> 00:24:51,880
You sound so listless.

503
00:24:51,880 --> 00:24:52,799
Are you still at the hospital?

504
00:24:52,799 --> 00:24:53,950
Why don't I go and visit you?

505
00:24:53,960 --> 00:24:54,759
Don't.

506
00:24:54,960 --> 00:24:56,950
You shouldn't come to a hospital
when you're healthy.

507
00:24:59,440 --> 00:25:01,840
I want to borrow some money from you.

508
00:25:01,999 --> 00:25:03,920
Sure. How much do you need?

509
00:25:04,540 --> 00:25:05,440
Is 50,000 yuan enough?

510
00:25:05,680 --> 00:25:06,799
That's more than enough.

511
00:25:06,799 --> 00:25:08,480
Sure.
I'll transfer it to you immediately.

512
00:25:09,519 --> 00:25:10,239
Thank you so much.

513
00:25:10,250 --> 00:25:12,150
No problem.
Why are you being courteous with me?

514
00:25:12,200 --> 00:25:12,880
I'll hang up now.

515
00:25:18,479 --> 00:25:19,400
Qi, let's go.

516
00:25:28,010 --> 00:25:29,719
Mom still needs rehabilitation training.

517
00:25:29,960 --> 00:25:31,960
There's a golden recovery period
for brain damage.

518
00:25:31,960 --> 00:25:33,239
There's no second chance.

519
00:25:34,840 --> 00:25:35,680
I know that too.

520
00:25:35,680 --> 00:25:37,559
But, where can we find the money?

521
00:25:38,759 --> 00:25:40,279
I'll do something about it.

522
00:25:40,410 --> 00:25:42,460
Go and get an appointment
with a specialist later.

523
00:25:42,479 --> 00:25:43,950
It's hard to get an appointment
in that department.

524
00:25:44,479 --> 00:25:45,079
Okay.

525
00:25:48,160 --> 00:25:48,840
Mingzhu,

526
00:25:50,559 --> 00:25:51,559
without you,

527
00:25:52,210 --> 00:25:53,640
our family would've been shattered.

528
00:25:57,160 --> 00:25:58,360
I'm here, aren't I?

529
00:26:00,200 --> 00:26:01,279
Your nephew is here too.

530
00:26:03,160 --> 00:26:04,880
Our family has already hit rock bottom.

531
00:26:05,719 --> 00:26:08,279
From now on,
everything will only get better.

532
00:26:14,120 --> 00:26:14,920
Meiqi, feel it.

533
00:26:15,920 --> 00:26:17,079
My baby is kicking me again.

534
00:26:30,600 --> 00:26:31,120
Mingzhu.

535
00:26:31,120 --> 00:26:31,719
Zhang.

536
00:26:31,999 --> 00:26:32,719
Where's Mr. Zhao?

537
00:26:32,719 --> 00:26:34,250
Mr. Zhao is having a meeting upstairs.

538
00:26:34,880 --> 00:26:35,920
I'll wait for him, then.

539
00:26:36,460 --> 00:26:37,719
Have you guys been busy lately?

540
00:26:38,319 --> 00:26:39,559
Business is dropping.

541
00:26:39,999 --> 00:26:41,279
What about the F&B Department?

542
00:26:41,360 --> 00:26:43,559
They're not doing well either.
We don't have walk-in customers.

543
00:26:43,559 --> 00:26:45,950
We have to depend on the clients
you introduced to us before.

544
00:26:48,880 --> 00:26:49,519
Mr. Zhao.

545
00:26:50,719 --> 00:26:51,360
Mingzhu.

546
00:26:51,479 --> 00:26:52,680
What brings you here?

547
00:26:52,840 --> 00:26:54,600
I came here to send my regards.

548
00:26:54,600 --> 00:26:56,799
My mother-in-law is recovering well.

549
00:26:56,799 --> 00:26:58,570
I'll come back to work
once she's discharged.

550
00:26:59,880 --> 00:27:00,479
It's fine.

551
00:27:00,719 --> 00:27:02,999
You don't get paid much
for working anyway.

552
00:27:03,279 --> 00:27:04,559
You should rest more.

553
00:27:05,039 --> 00:27:06,750
I have something else to do.
I'll resume my work first.

554
00:27:07,479 --> 00:27:08,519
Keep this with you.

555
00:27:08,519 --> 00:27:09,039
Okay.

556
00:27:16,319 --> 00:27:17,319
Hello, Zhixia.

557
00:27:17,360 --> 00:27:19,110
I returned to the hotel
to sign off on my leave.

558
00:27:19,120 --> 00:27:21,450
I realize that our business
has been affected significantly.

559
00:27:21,519 --> 00:27:23,680
What about the sales
of Rufeng Liquor on your side?

560
00:27:23,999 --> 00:27:25,200
It was okay at first.

561
00:27:25,200 --> 00:27:26,650
But now, we're doing poorly as well.

562
00:27:27,559 --> 00:27:29,920
There's an issue
with Nanxi Hotel's management.

563
00:27:31,170 --> 00:27:32,680
I heard that there would be a layoff.

564
00:27:32,920 --> 00:27:33,719
A layoff?

565
00:27:34,880 --> 00:27:36,319
It won't affect me, right?

566
00:27:36,960 --> 00:27:39,400
I have to depend on this job
to support my child.

567
00:27:39,400 --> 00:27:41,279
That won't be. You're pregnant.

568
00:27:41,279 --> 00:27:42,880
Your boss can't do anything to you.

569
00:27:43,360 --> 00:27:44,999
You should work there for now.

570
00:27:45,030 --> 00:27:46,999
You can think about it
after your child is born.

571
00:27:47,010 --> 00:27:48,950
You're already looking for
a better option, aren't you?

572
00:27:50,480 --> 00:27:51,799
How is your mother-in-law doing?

573
00:27:52,239 --> 00:27:53,190
She's much better now.

574
00:27:53,519 --> 00:27:54,920
She'll be discharged soon.

575
00:27:55,960 --> 00:27:56,920
I'm glad to hear that.

576
00:27:58,120 --> 00:27:59,519
Alright, then. I'll hang up now.

577
00:28:00,130 --> 00:28:01,200
I still have things to do.

578
00:28:01,880 --> 00:28:03,279
Okay. Call me anytime

579
00:28:03,279 --> 00:28:04,719
if you need anything.

580
00:28:04,719 --> 00:28:05,239
Okay.

581
00:28:05,440 --> 00:28:06,079
Goodbye.

582
00:28:11,319 --> 00:28:12,360
What are you looking at?

583
00:28:12,920 --> 00:28:14,440
I want to look for a better option too.

584
00:28:16,680 --> 00:28:18,960
Go ahead, then.

585
00:28:19,600 --> 00:28:21,279
You think you're that capable?

586
00:28:22,120 --> 00:28:24,850
You should be grateful that you can work for
a pregnant boss like me.

587
00:28:25,079 --> 00:28:25,950
What are you looking for?

588
00:28:26,960 --> 00:28:28,039
Let me help you out.

589
00:28:28,970 --> 00:28:30,290
We're looking for a better option.

590
00:28:36,960 --> 00:28:38,239
Look at what I've brought you.

591
00:28:41,160 --> 00:28:42,200
It's snow fungus soup.

592
00:28:42,840 --> 00:28:44,519
Mom made it for you specifically.

593
00:28:44,920 --> 00:28:47,080
It nourishes your skin
and relieves liver heatiness.

594
00:28:47,680 --> 00:28:50,160
You're saying that I have
a short tantrum, aren't you?

595
00:28:52,880 --> 00:28:53,920
Maodou, do you want some?

596
00:28:55,160 --> 00:28:56,400
My liver isn't that heaty.

597
00:28:56,400 --> 00:28:57,239
See you.

598
00:28:58,140 --> 00:28:59,430
Are you going
to look for a better option?

599
00:28:59,440 --> 00:29:00,920
My current option is pretty good too.

600
00:29:02,120 --> 00:29:03,360
It's great that she has left.

601
00:29:03,760 --> 00:29:04,999
This way, you can have it all.

602
00:29:10,920 --> 00:29:11,680
Have a try.

603
00:29:13,440 --> 00:29:15,239
I'm deeply honored
that she's caring for me.

604
00:29:15,680 --> 00:29:16,680
But I'm not drinking it.

605
00:29:17,060 --> 00:29:19,250
I'm not good enough
to be your family's daughter-in-law.

606
00:29:20,920 --> 00:29:23,279
Why don't I be
your family's son-in-law, then?

607
00:29:25,079 --> 00:29:25,920
Have a try.

608
00:29:31,160 --> 00:29:33,680
I know that pregnant women
shouldn't consume too much sugar.

609
00:29:33,960 --> 00:29:35,660
I've reduced the amount of rock sugar.

610
00:29:37,039 --> 00:29:38,440
Didn't your mom make it?

611
00:29:38,440 --> 00:29:40,039
My mom always does it
with less sugar.

612
00:29:44,920 --> 00:29:47,160
You have to cook it longer next time.

613
00:29:47,400 --> 00:29:48,519
It's not thick enough.

614
00:29:48,600 --> 00:29:50,260
I cooked it for over an hour, you know?

615
00:29:50,920 --> 00:29:52,400
I mean, my mom cooked it.

616
00:29:59,200 --> 00:30:01,420
My mom wants to buy some clothes
for our unborn baby.

617
00:30:01,440 --> 00:30:02,719
What color do you like?

618
00:30:05,240 --> 00:30:06,759
My family already has heavy burdens.

619
00:30:06,960 --> 00:30:08,850
I dare not request anything
from you or your mom.

620
00:30:09,360 --> 00:30:11,559
I'll tell you off if you say that again.

621
00:30:12,079 --> 00:30:13,640
What did you mean by that?

622
00:30:13,880 --> 00:30:14,799
How can people like us

623
00:30:14,799 --> 00:30:18,600
repent for our mistakes if you dare not
request anything from us?

624
00:30:18,600 --> 00:30:19,239
You...

625
00:30:19,740 --> 00:30:21,400
Please forgive me.
Please don't be angry.

626
00:30:24,200 --> 00:30:25,920
I prefer pale yellow.

627
00:30:26,440 --> 00:30:27,880
It's suitable for both genders.

628
00:30:27,920 --> 00:30:29,559
I think my mom
bought the same color too.

629
00:30:29,559 --> 00:30:30,950
We'll have a full set
if you buy the same.

630
00:30:31,160 --> 00:30:32,360
Pale yellow, huh? Alright.

631
00:30:32,370 --> 00:30:34,300
I need to return
the green ones I bought, then.

632
00:30:34,340 --> 00:30:36,150
I suppose pale yellow
suits our baby better.

633
00:30:36,640 --> 00:30:38,039
I mean, my mom.

634
00:30:42,519 --> 00:30:43,519
Your room is pretty hot.

635
00:30:43,519 --> 00:30:44,020
(8 A.M. on the 30th, Pregnancy Checkup)

636
00:30:46,590 --> 00:30:48,020
I have a pregnancy checkup tomorrow.

637
00:30:49,279 --> 00:30:49,960
At 8 A.M.?

638
00:30:50,210 --> 00:30:51,640
If so, we have to leave at 7:15 A.M.

639
00:30:51,799 --> 00:30:54,039
And, you have to fast
for tomorrow's blood test as well.

640
00:30:54,039 --> 00:30:55,039
That means you can't take breakfast.

641
00:30:55,039 --> 00:30:56,239
I'll deliver breakfast to you, then.

642
00:30:56,239 --> 00:30:57,250
Is porridge okay with you?

643
00:30:59,260 --> 00:31:00,750
Alright. I'll deliver porridge to you.

644
00:31:02,999 --> 00:31:04,519
Look at the proposal we have here.

645
00:31:04,520 --> 00:31:05,640
The writer is truly talented.

646
00:31:05,640 --> 00:31:06,479
Excellent work.

647
00:31:07,840 --> 00:31:08,840
Maodou wrote it.

648
00:31:08,840 --> 00:31:09,840
I'm proofreading it.

649
00:31:10,300 --> 00:31:11,200
I think it's ordinary.

650
00:31:11,960 --> 00:31:13,150
It lacks careful consideration.

651
00:31:13,360 --> 00:31:14,650
She has to learn more from you.

652
00:31:15,279 --> 00:31:15,880
Here.

653
00:31:18,560 --> 00:31:20,630
Zhixia, I've arranged
a 4D ultrasound scan for you.

654
00:31:20,640 --> 00:31:21,360
Thank you.

655
00:31:21,820 --> 00:31:23,039
When are you free for a meal?

656
00:31:23,799 --> 00:31:24,640
Recently,

657
00:31:25,640 --> 00:31:26,740
I have to work overtime shifts.

658
00:31:26,759 --> 00:31:27,799
What about next time?

659
00:31:27,880 --> 00:31:29,400
I'm quite busy this entire month.

660
00:31:29,799 --> 00:31:30,719
What about next month?

661
00:31:30,780 --> 00:31:31,600
Or the month after?

662
00:31:31,600 --> 00:31:32,940
I'm sure you have some free time.

663
00:31:33,160 --> 00:31:34,920
We're friends forever, right?

664
00:31:35,719 --> 00:31:36,319
See you.

665
00:31:39,050 --> 00:31:40,120
Please resume your work.

666
00:31:40,200 --> 00:31:40,719
Okay.

667
00:31:44,239 --> 00:31:44,920
How is it?

668
00:31:45,140 --> 00:31:46,680
The doctor said everything was good.

669
00:31:47,210 --> 00:31:49,519
And, I have a 4D ultrasound scan
on the 1st of next month.

670
00:31:50,079 --> 00:31:51,319
I'm getting nervous now.

671
00:31:51,680 --> 00:31:52,840
What are you nervous about?

672
00:31:53,260 --> 00:31:55,260
Every member of our family
was handsome and robust

673
00:31:55,279 --> 00:31:57,960
going three generations back.

674
00:31:57,960 --> 00:32:00,400
But none of you was a HOD.

675
00:32:01,960 --> 00:32:04,239
I have to pass down the task
to the next generation.

676
00:32:05,340 --> 00:32:06,360
I'll leave it to you now.

677
00:32:07,279 --> 00:32:08,590
Since you like the title so much,

678
00:32:08,600 --> 00:32:10,079
why don't we call our child

679
00:32:10,079 --> 00:32:11,360
HOD Zhang?

680
00:32:12,160 --> 00:32:13,920
That was a lousy joke.

681
00:32:16,920 --> 00:32:18,999
Say, since you're close with Dr. Li,

682
00:32:19,640 --> 00:32:21,039
can we ask him to help us see

683
00:32:21,039 --> 00:32:22,479
whether it's a boy or a girl?

684
00:32:23,160 --> 00:32:24,840
What? You think
you can change our child's gender?

685
00:32:24,880 --> 00:32:25,519
Of course not.

686
00:32:25,519 --> 00:32:26,999
It's the same no matter the gender.

687
00:32:27,400 --> 00:32:29,920
We can't get Dr. Li fired because of us.

688
00:32:30,400 --> 00:32:31,160
You're right.

689
00:32:35,160 --> 00:32:38,709
Although your mom always said
both genders were equal,

690
00:32:39,039 --> 00:32:40,810
and she treated Jiao
like a precious jewel,

691
00:32:40,840 --> 00:32:42,160
I could tell

692
00:32:42,600 --> 00:32:44,479
that your mom still wanted a grandson.

693
00:32:44,970 --> 00:32:46,350
I can't discuss this topic with her.

694
00:32:46,640 --> 00:32:48,840
Go back and give her a reminder.

695
00:32:49,239 --> 00:32:50,279
To favor boys over girls

696
00:32:50,360 --> 00:32:52,160
is just like accepting bribes.

697
00:32:52,460 --> 00:32:53,799
One shouldn't even think about it,

698
00:32:54,079 --> 00:32:55,200
let alone do it.

699
00:32:55,960 --> 00:32:56,719
Say,

700
00:32:57,740 --> 00:32:59,039
my mom said the exact same thing

701
00:32:59,039 --> 00:33:00,360
you said just now.

702
00:33:00,360 --> 00:33:01,200
Don't worry.

703
00:33:01,200 --> 00:33:02,840
The old lady is well aware of it.

704
00:33:02,840 --> 00:33:04,120
She won't even think about it.

705
00:33:04,120 --> 00:33:04,950
My phone is ringing.

706
00:33:05,120 --> 00:33:06,600
Who's calling you?

707
00:33:08,360 --> 00:33:09,039
It's Mom.

708
00:33:11,200 --> 00:33:11,840
Mom.

709
00:33:13,010 --> 00:33:15,120
Zhang Hao and I came to the hospital
for a pregnancy checkup.

710
00:33:15,120 --> 00:33:15,850
What's the matter?

711
00:33:15,960 --> 00:33:17,120
Yeah. We're together.

712
00:33:17,120 --> 00:33:19,160
There's a clinic downstairs.

713
00:33:19,719 --> 00:33:21,650
They can identify
the gender of an unborn child.

714
00:33:24,360 --> 00:33:25,840
Mom, why are you bringing that up again?

715
00:33:25,840 --> 00:33:27,279
I told Zhang Hao about it just now.

716
00:33:27,279 --> 00:33:29,300
It's pointless since
we can't do anything about it.

717
00:33:29,319 --> 00:33:29,920
Yeah.

718
00:33:30,079 --> 00:33:31,200
Don't misunderstand me.

719
00:33:31,479 --> 00:33:33,559
I don't favor boys over girls.

720
00:33:33,920 --> 00:33:35,999
I just want to be prepared in advance.

721
00:33:36,880 --> 00:33:38,640
No matter what, I won't go there.

722
00:33:38,840 --> 00:33:40,920
Mom, please don't waste your time on it.

723
00:33:41,160 --> 00:33:41,880
I'll hang up now.

724
00:33:42,460 --> 00:33:43,940
I thought you said she was aware of it.

725
00:33:43,960 --> 00:33:44,559
That's not it.

726
00:33:44,560 --> 00:33:45,680
Was that what you meant by being aware?

727
00:33:45,680 --> 00:33:47,840
Let's talk this over.
Why are you getting angry at me?

728
00:33:50,039 --> 00:33:50,880
Wait, Zhang Hao.

729
00:33:51,680 --> 00:33:53,039
Why is your mom obsessed with

730
00:33:53,039 --> 00:33:54,120
our baby's gender recently?

731
00:33:54,130 --> 00:33:55,440
Are you hiding something from me?

732
00:33:55,840 --> 00:33:56,600
Not at all.

733
00:33:57,440 --> 00:33:58,039
Tell me!

734
00:33:58,039 --> 00:33:58,880
It's a tiny matter.

735
00:34:00,790 --> 00:34:02,319
Don't be angry when I tell you, okay?

736
00:34:02,319 --> 00:34:03,840
I'll be angrier if you keep it from me.

737
00:34:04,519 --> 00:34:06,999
Our old house is
scheduled for demolition.

738
00:34:07,680 --> 00:34:08,999
According to Mom,

739
00:34:08,999 --> 00:34:11,840
if we have a boy,
we'll buy a school district house.

740
00:34:13,660 --> 00:34:14,479
What if it's a girl?

741
00:34:15,560 --> 00:34:17,240
We have
to buy something for her as well.

742
00:34:17,639 --> 00:34:18,760
Maybe a gold necklace.

743
00:34:19,599 --> 00:34:21,639
We might give up
on the school district house.

744
00:34:25,360 --> 00:34:26,720
So, you're buying it if it's a boy,

745
00:34:27,479 --> 00:34:28,840
and scraping the idea if it's a girl.

746
00:34:29,920 --> 00:34:32,079
Your mom is
a retired official, you know?

747
00:34:32,079 --> 00:34:33,199
Why is she acting the same

748
00:34:33,199 --> 00:34:35,039
as my mom, who's merely a housewife?

749
00:34:35,980 --> 00:34:38,100
She's always full of lofty principles
when she talks to me.

750
00:34:38,119 --> 00:34:39,920
But now, she's revealing
her true colors, huh?

751
00:34:40,280 --> 00:34:41,320
What do you mean by that?

752
00:34:41,320 --> 00:34:42,039
What do you mean by true colors?

753
00:34:42,039 --> 00:34:43,550
What do you think her true colors are?

754
00:34:43,660 --> 00:34:45,079
That's my mom you're talking about.

755
00:34:45,079 --> 00:34:46,519
She's getting old, you know?

756
00:34:46,519 --> 00:34:48,999
It's normal for old people
to favor boys over girls.

757
00:34:48,999 --> 00:34:49,999
She can say whatever she likes.

758
00:34:49,999 --> 00:34:51,159
We can just ignore her.

759
00:34:51,159 --> 00:34:51,800
Ignore her?

760
00:34:51,810 --> 00:34:53,650
She'll keep pestering me
even if I ignore her.

761
00:34:53,679 --> 00:34:55,580
Do you think I need
more of that in my life?

762
00:34:56,720 --> 00:34:58,079
I'll tell your mom about it now.

763
00:34:58,119 --> 00:34:59,199
This child is mine.

764
00:34:59,199 --> 00:35:00,320
She doesn't need to worry about it.

765
00:35:00,320 --> 00:35:02,360
Wait. What are you trying to tell her?

766
00:35:04,479 --> 00:35:05,199
We're a family.

767
00:35:05,199 --> 00:35:06,599
Why are you making
such a huge deal out of it?

768
00:35:06,599 --> 00:35:07,599
She's my mom.

769
00:35:07,960 --> 00:35:09,119
We have to coax our parents.

770
00:35:09,119 --> 00:35:10,119
You mustn't go against her.

771
00:35:10,119 --> 00:35:11,119
Why should I coax her?

772
00:35:11,119 --> 00:35:12,559
Why should I?

773
00:35:13,079 --> 00:35:15,280
In this family, every member comes to me

774
00:35:15,280 --> 00:35:16,479
whenever they're in trouble.

775
00:35:16,479 --> 00:35:17,999
You expect me to coax everyone?

776
00:35:17,999 --> 00:35:19,360
Am I the service model?

777
00:35:20,079 --> 00:35:21,199
Zhang Hao, listen up.

778
00:35:21,200 --> 00:35:23,310
I'm done coaxing you all.
I don't want to do it again.

779
00:35:23,320 --> 00:35:24,199
From today onward,

780
00:35:24,199 --> 00:35:25,559
I don't care if anyone gets angry.

781
00:35:25,560 --> 00:35:27,650
I'm pregnant. To me,
that's the most important thing.

782
00:35:28,199 --> 00:35:30,360
Now, I'll only treat myself nicely.

783
00:35:30,519 --> 00:35:32,079
I'll do whatever I like.

784
00:35:32,519 --> 00:35:33,079
Wait.

785
00:35:34,760 --> 00:35:35,679
Xu Zhixia!

786
00:35:52,680 --> 00:35:54,199
In the future, when I have the dough,

787
00:35:54,199 --> 00:35:55,559
I'll buy gold bars for my baby.

788
00:35:55,620 --> 00:35:57,920
I'll save them up for him
until the day he gets married.

789
00:35:57,920 --> 00:35:59,519
I'm sure I'll be able
to buy a lot of gold for him.

790
00:35:59,519 --> 00:36:01,360
By then,
I'll give them all to him at once.

791
00:36:01,519 --> 00:36:02,880
Don't you think I'm very generous?

792
00:36:08,460 --> 00:36:10,420
(1218)

793
00:36:12,860 --> 00:36:15,620
(Birth Date, 18 December)

794
00:36:18,960 --> 00:36:20,800
So, these aren't meant for us.

795
00:36:30,800 --> 00:36:31,720
Hello, Meiqi.

796
00:36:32,240 --> 00:36:33,400
Mingzhu, hurry and come.

797
00:36:33,680 --> 00:36:35,199
The shameless mistress is here again.

798
00:36:39,599 --> 00:36:40,360
Who's this?

799
00:36:40,639 --> 00:36:41,360
Mickey Mouse.

800
00:36:44,479 --> 00:36:45,479
What are they doing?

801
00:36:47,599 --> 00:36:48,800
Its head is covered.

802
00:36:51,479 --> 00:36:53,159
These are lions.

803
00:36:54,880 --> 00:36:55,599
Meiqi.

804
00:36:58,119 --> 00:36:59,679
Its head is stuck in the fish bowl.

805
00:37:04,260 --> 00:37:06,930
You took your kid to the hospital
just to fight for the inheritance, huh?

806
00:37:06,960 --> 00:37:08,240
Do you think that's appropriate?

807
00:37:08,280 --> 00:37:09,350
You're overthinking it.

808
00:37:09,560 --> 00:37:11,119
I know that you guys are penniless now.

809
00:37:11,240 --> 00:37:12,479
Why are you still here, then?

810
00:37:12,479 --> 00:37:13,720
I need to return
to my hometown for a few days.

811
00:37:13,720 --> 00:37:14,830
There's no one to look after Xiaoqi.

812
00:37:14,840 --> 00:37:15,720
So?

813
00:37:15,720 --> 00:37:16,720
What has that got to do with us?

814
00:37:16,720 --> 00:37:18,440
Of course it has
something to do with you.

815
00:37:18,460 --> 00:37:19,479
Xiaoqi's surname is Feng.

816
00:37:19,479 --> 00:37:21,250
That means the Feng family
has to look after him.

817
00:37:21,280 --> 00:37:22,840
Although his dad is dead,
he still has a stepsister.

818
00:37:22,880 --> 00:37:23,880
And a stepsister-in-law.

819
00:37:23,880 --> 00:37:25,479
We don't even know
if he's Dad's child or not.

820
00:37:25,479 --> 00:37:26,360
Nonsense!

821
00:37:32,159 --> 00:37:33,950
Want to see a photo of your dad
cutting his umbilical cord?

822
00:37:35,060 --> 00:37:36,599
Do you want to see
the photos of your dad

823
00:37:36,599 --> 00:37:37,400
hosting the full-moon banquet?

824
00:37:37,400 --> 00:37:38,840
What about the photos we took
when we were in a hot spring together?

825
00:37:38,840 --> 00:37:39,479
Get lost!

826
00:37:39,479 --> 00:37:41,079
That's enough.

827
00:37:41,660 --> 00:37:42,720
My father-in-law
has already passed away.

828
00:37:42,720 --> 00:37:44,199
Stop hurting each other.

829
00:37:47,360 --> 00:37:47,960
Fine.

830
00:37:52,400 --> 00:37:53,559
Here is Xiaoqi's water cup

831
00:37:53,559 --> 00:37:54,760
and some clean clothes.

832
00:37:54,880 --> 00:37:56,639
Please look after him
for the next few days.

833
00:37:56,639 --> 00:37:57,950
I'll return as soon as possible.

834
00:37:58,760 --> 00:37:59,760
Are you serious?

835
00:38:00,060 --> 00:38:02,159
How do you expect us
to look after a young child like him?

836
00:38:02,159 --> 00:38:03,479
No mom would do such a thing.

837
00:38:03,479 --> 00:38:04,950
Do you think
I'm doing so of my own accord?

838
00:38:05,060 --> 00:38:07,790
You're trying your best to raise funds
for your mother-in-law's treatment.

839
00:38:07,800 --> 00:38:08,999
I'm trying my best to make money

840
00:38:08,999 --> 00:38:09,840
to raise Xiaoqi.

841
00:38:09,840 --> 00:38:11,119
Doesn't that make us the same?

842
00:38:11,960 --> 00:38:13,870
A round-trip flight to my hometown
costs 3,000 yuan.

843
00:38:13,880 --> 00:38:15,450
If I take my child with me,
I have to fork out another 3,000 yuan.

844
00:38:15,639 --> 00:38:17,320
Will you guys pay for that?

845
00:38:23,479 --> 00:38:24,199
Please.

846
00:38:28,280 --> 00:38:28,920
Xiaoqi.

847
00:38:29,360 --> 00:38:30,440
I'll make a move first.

848
00:38:30,920 --> 00:38:32,240
Goodbye, Mom.

849
00:38:34,720 --> 00:38:35,360
Ding Hong.

850
00:38:36,280 --> 00:38:36,920
Ding Hong!

851
00:38:36,920 --> 00:38:37,960
Ding Hong, don't leave!

852
00:38:38,479 --> 00:38:40,199
Miss!

853
00:38:41,199 --> 00:38:41,920
Miss,

854
00:38:42,159 --> 00:38:44,679
Mom told me to follow you.

855
00:38:56,479 --> 00:38:57,119
Where is she?

856
00:38:57,720 --> 00:38:58,320
She ran away.

857
00:39:15,360 --> 00:39:16,199
She's not picking up.

858
00:39:19,280 --> 00:39:20,210
What should we do, then?

859
00:39:22,140 --> 00:39:22,960
Let's call the cops.

860
00:39:31,479 --> 00:39:32,159
Don't worry.

861
00:39:32,160 --> 00:39:34,159
We already managed
to contact Feng Xiaoqi's mom.

862
00:39:34,159 --> 00:39:34,840
What did she say?

863
00:39:35,079 --> 00:39:37,280
She said she had to return to her hometown
due to an emergency.

864
00:39:37,360 --> 00:39:38,119
She has entrusted her child

865
00:39:38,119 --> 00:39:39,450
to his sister-in-law and elder sister.

866
00:39:39,479 --> 00:39:39,960
By the way,

867
00:39:40,159 --> 00:39:41,840
which of you is his elder sister?

868
00:39:42,119 --> 00:39:42,960
She's my elder sister.

869
00:39:42,960 --> 00:39:43,720
I'm not your elder sister.

870
00:39:43,720 --> 00:39:44,720
I don't even know you.

871
00:39:46,599 --> 00:39:47,199
Miss,

872
00:39:47,760 --> 00:39:48,639
show me your ID card.

873
00:39:48,920 --> 00:39:50,920
Sir, you don't understand the situation.

874
00:39:50,920 --> 00:39:52,479
He's not my...

875
00:39:54,720 --> 00:39:55,400
Enough.

876
00:39:57,280 --> 00:39:58,679
Sir, it's like this.

877
00:39:59,960 --> 00:40:02,360
My father-in-law had this child
outside our family.

878
00:40:03,199 --> 00:40:04,119
Where is he, then?

879
00:40:05,199 --> 00:40:06,240
He has already passed away.

880
00:40:09,039 --> 00:40:11,079
Well, this is a family dispute, then.

881
00:40:12,639 --> 00:40:13,479
Wait here.

882
00:40:13,920 --> 00:40:14,960
Let me make another call.

883
00:40:27,479 --> 00:40:28,840
Hello. How can I help you?

884
00:40:29,360 --> 00:40:30,079
I need a room.

885
00:40:30,240 --> 00:40:30,720
Okay.

886
00:40:30,720 --> 00:40:31,479
I want a suite.

887
00:40:34,199 --> 00:40:34,800
Miss,

888
00:40:35,280 --> 00:40:37,280
a suite costs 2,888 yuan.

889
00:40:40,920 --> 00:40:43,479
Please change it
to a Deluxe King Room instead.

890
00:40:43,479 --> 00:40:44,760
A suite is too big for me.

891
00:40:44,760 --> 00:40:45,639
I'm alone.

892
00:40:45,960 --> 00:40:46,960
It'll be scary.

893
00:40:47,639 --> 00:40:48,240
Okay.

894
00:41:03,760 --> 00:41:04,440
Dear.

895
00:41:10,240 --> 00:41:10,920
Dear?

896
00:41:33,119 --> 00:41:34,119
Xu Zhixia,

897
00:41:35,079 --> 00:41:36,079
great job.

898
00:41:36,760 --> 00:41:38,960
You're finally willing
to spend money on yourself.

899
00:41:40,170 --> 00:41:42,479
You should've treated yourself
nicely from the start.

900
00:41:49,599 --> 00:41:50,479
It's gorgeous.

901
00:41:53,960 --> 00:41:54,720
What did she say?

902
00:41:55,270 --> 00:41:56,400
She didn't answer my call.

903
00:41:56,960 --> 00:41:58,679
She's abandoning her child
when he's this young?

904
00:41:58,679 --> 00:41:59,679
Sir, doesn't this count as abandonment?

905
00:41:59,679 --> 00:42:01,100
Miss, that's enough. Please calm down.

906
00:42:01,119 --> 00:42:02,119
The case of abandonment

907
00:42:02,199 --> 00:42:03,599
doesn't depend solely
on objective actions.

908
00:42:03,599 --> 00:42:04,830
It also depends on subjective intent.

909
00:42:04,840 --> 00:42:06,060
You guys don't get to decide that.

910
00:42:06,079 --> 00:42:08,079
Wait. What should we do now, then?

911
00:42:08,079 --> 00:42:09,599
Since you guys are his elder sisters,

912
00:42:09,599 --> 00:42:10,599
and he's quite young,

913
00:42:10,599 --> 00:42:11,950
it's inconvenient
for you guys to remain here.

914
00:42:11,960 --> 00:42:12,960
You guys should take him home

915
00:42:12,960 --> 00:42:14,160
and look after him for now.

916
00:42:14,170 --> 00:42:15,479
What kind of solution is that?

917
00:42:15,479 --> 00:42:16,679
You're a cop.

918
00:42:16,679 --> 00:42:17,960
Sir, listen to me.

919
00:42:17,960 --> 00:42:19,320
Right now,
we have a patient to look after.

920
00:42:19,320 --> 00:42:20,519
And, she's still hospitalized.

921
00:42:20,519 --> 00:42:22,720
We are in no shape
to look after another child.

922
00:42:22,720 --> 00:42:23,760
Yeah. Besides...

923
00:42:23,760 --> 00:42:24,479
Enough.

924
00:42:24,679 --> 00:42:26,240
Now, you have two choices.

925
00:42:26,240 --> 00:42:27,360
Firstly, overcome your hardships

926
00:42:27,360 --> 00:42:28,479
and take him home.

927
00:42:28,479 --> 00:42:30,199
Secondly, let the child
overcome his hardships

928
00:42:30,199 --> 00:42:31,550
and let him wait for his mom here.

929
00:42:31,560 --> 00:42:33,760
Wait. Didn't you say that
his mom didn't pick up the phone?

930
00:42:33,760 --> 00:42:35,350
That's why I said you have to wait here.

931
00:42:36,140 --> 00:42:37,960
You have to wait until
she picks up the phone.
