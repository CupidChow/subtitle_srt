00:01:15,220 --> 00:01:17,780
=Episode 18=

4
00:01:17,960 --> 00:01:18,759
Thank you.

5
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:20,800
Thank you, Mrs. Yuan.

6
00:01:20,800 --> 00:01:22,000
Thank you, Mr. Yuan.

7
00:01:22,080 --> 00:01:22,839
Help yourself.

8
00:01:23,279 --> 00:01:24,039
Sure.

9
00:01:24,600 --> 00:01:25,399
The tea's nice.

10
00:01:25,399 --> 00:01:26,029
Nice, right?

11
00:01:26,030 --> 00:01:27,204
You've got good taste in tea.

12
00:01:27,248 --> 00:01:28,640
Mr. Xu, Mrs. Xu, have some fruit.

13
00:01:28,720 --> 00:01:29,880
Ms. Yu, have some grapes.

14
00:01:30,600 --> 00:01:31,039
Sure.

15
00:01:31,039 --> 00:01:31,919
Zhidong, eat some.

16
00:01:32,080 --> 00:01:33,000
Bichen

17
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:34,720
is really a thoughtful girl.

18
00:01:34,720 --> 00:01:35,600
She's really thoughtful.

19
00:01:35,604 --> 00:01:36,182
Yeah.

20
00:01:36,479 --> 00:01:37,440
Bichen,

21
00:01:37,800 --> 00:01:39,080
we're leaving Zhidong

22
00:01:39,080 --> 00:01:40,440
in your care.

23
00:01:43,279 --> 00:01:43,960
Ms. Yu,

24
00:01:44,559 --> 00:01:46,360
Zhidong is honest and hardworking.

25
00:01:46,720 --> 00:01:48,000
Bichen's dad and I

26
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:49,199
like him a lot.

27
00:01:50,600 --> 00:01:51,479
If you ask me,

28
00:01:51,720 --> 00:01:54,360
they're a match made in heaven.

29
00:01:54,560 --> 00:01:56,160
They're perfectly suited for each other.

30
00:01:56,160 --> 00:01:57,440
That's right.

31
00:01:57,440 --> 00:01:58,737
They're buttering each other up.

32
00:01:58,759 --> 00:01:59,880
Have some fruit.

33
00:01:59,880 --> 00:02:00,871
- Sure.
- Have some tea.

34
00:02:00,871 --> 00:02:01,750
Sure.

35
00:02:03,160 --> 00:02:03,880
Mr. Xu,

36
00:02:04,440 --> 00:02:06,319
they're about to get married.

37
00:02:06,640 --> 00:02:07,720
We're family now,

38
00:02:07,720 --> 00:02:09,119
so no need to stand on ceremony.

39
00:02:10,159 --> 00:02:11,920
At our last lunch,

40
00:02:11,920 --> 00:02:14,204
we talked about
two hundred thousand bride price.

41
00:02:16,080 --> 00:02:17,320
Yes. Well.

42
00:02:17,719 --> 00:02:18,879
The bride price

43
00:02:19,480 --> 00:02:21,999
has been ready.

44
00:02:22,960 --> 00:02:23,360
Yeah.

45
00:02:23,360 --> 00:02:24,879
No problem.

46
00:02:24,879 --> 00:02:25,999
Yes.

47
00:02:27,119 --> 00:02:28,920
Well, but

48
00:02:29,839 --> 00:02:31,439
marriage

49
00:02:31,879 --> 00:02:33,159
is a major life event.

50
00:02:33,719 --> 00:02:35,719
It must be taken seriously.

51
00:02:35,719 --> 00:02:36,240
Exactly.

52
00:02:36,240 --> 00:02:37,640
I think it should be decent

53
00:02:38,760 --> 00:02:40,080
and classy,

54
00:02:41,559 --> 00:02:43,240
but we should still honor tradition.

55
00:02:47,119 --> 00:02:49,480
Our hometown is Yujia Village.

56
00:02:50,399 --> 00:02:52,559
The village

57
00:02:52,559 --> 00:02:53,879
has an old custom.

58
00:02:53,982 --> 00:02:55,040
Well, this is how it works.

59
00:02:55,320 --> 00:02:57,279
On the night before the wedding,

60
00:02:57,800 --> 00:02:58,800
the bride price

61
00:02:59,159 --> 00:03:01,760
is to be sealed
inside a big red envelope,

62
00:03:02,159 --> 00:03:03,119
and the mother-in-law

63
00:03:03,360 --> 00:03:05,040
personally hands it to the bride.

64
00:03:05,599 --> 00:03:07,040
It means

65
00:03:07,640 --> 00:03:10,240
the groom's family truly values her.

66
00:03:12,240 --> 00:03:12,960
Ms. Yu,

67
00:03:13,480 --> 00:03:14,679
isn't the bride not supposed

68
00:03:14,679 --> 00:03:16,480
to attend that event?

69
00:03:16,960 --> 00:03:18,839
I've never heard of this custom.

70
00:03:20,200 --> 00:03:22,999
Uh, every village has different customs.

71
00:03:24,679 --> 00:03:25,320
Well...

72
00:03:25,320 --> 00:03:25,920
Yes.

73
00:03:27,719 --> 00:03:29,320
That's Yujia Village's custom.

74
00:03:29,590 --> 00:03:30,493
I know this one.

75
00:03:31,679 --> 00:03:32,399
Old customs

76
00:03:33,200 --> 00:03:34,399
are the ancestors' wisdom.

77
00:03:35,080 --> 00:03:36,269
How would you know

78
00:03:36,270 --> 00:03:38,350
- Yujia Village's customs?
- How do you know that...

79
00:03:38,559 --> 00:03:40,439
How do you know?

80
00:03:40,920 --> 00:03:43,439
Marriage is a major life event.

81
00:03:44,119 --> 00:03:45,320
I did my research before this.

82
00:03:45,320 --> 00:03:47,439
I've learned every detail.

83
00:03:51,119 --> 00:03:51,599
Ms. Yu,

84
00:03:52,240 --> 00:03:54,200
let's follow the Yujia Village.

85
00:03:56,719 --> 00:03:58,320
Let's do it that way.

86
00:03:59,360 --> 00:04:00,320
Yeah.

87
00:04:00,719 --> 00:04:02,800
Mr. Yuan, Mrs. Yuan,

88
00:04:03,040 --> 00:04:04,999
you can entrust your daughter to us.

89
00:04:05,640 --> 00:04:06,960
Rest assured.

90
00:04:08,360 --> 00:04:08,719
You see,

91
00:04:09,640 --> 00:04:10,480
you've treasured

92
00:04:10,480 --> 00:04:11,960
this girl

93
00:04:12,360 --> 00:04:13,559
like a pearl in your palm.

94
00:04:13,848 --> 00:04:15,515
When she marries into our house,

95
00:04:15,559 --> 00:04:16,479
she's a treasure

96
00:04:17,239 --> 00:04:18,960
we cherish.

97
00:04:18,960 --> 00:04:20,120
Yes. We'll cherish her.

98
00:04:20,479 --> 00:04:22,080
If anyone dares to bully her,

99
00:04:22,226 --> 00:04:24,960
as her mother-in-law,
I'll be the first one to protect her.

100
00:04:25,039 --> 00:04:27,000
And as her father-in-law,
I'll protect her too.

101
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:27,599
Alright.

102
00:04:27,960 --> 00:04:28,799
Me too.

103
00:04:32,479 --> 00:04:33,039
Mom,

104
00:04:33,159 --> 00:04:34,520
something's burning.

105
00:04:34,520 --> 00:04:35,880
I left something on the stove.

106
00:04:36,799 --> 00:04:37,520
Burnt?

107
00:04:37,680 --> 00:04:40,239
She has a keen nose.

108
00:04:40,239 --> 00:04:42,120
I didn't smell a thing.

109
00:04:42,880 --> 00:04:44,680
Bichen's got a dog's nose.

110
00:04:44,737 --> 00:04:45,560
Her nose is sharp.

111
00:04:49,960 --> 00:04:50,680
Mr. Yuan,

112
00:04:52,159 --> 00:04:54,039
let me offer you a toast.

113
00:04:55,320 --> 00:04:57,000
Thank you for backing us.

114
00:04:58,880 --> 00:04:59,560
Mr. Xu,

115
00:05:00,426 --> 00:05:01,710
as long as the kids are happy.

116
00:05:03,599 --> 00:05:04,440
Cheers, Ms. Yu.

117
00:05:04,440 --> 00:05:05,390
Thank you for backing us.

118
00:05:05,404 --> 00:05:06,471
Thank you for backing us.

119
00:05:14,159 --> 00:05:15,000
You caught a cold?

120
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:15,479
Here.

121
00:05:16,071 --> 00:05:17,030
Drink some warm water.

122
00:05:17,680 --> 00:05:18,359
I'm hungry.

123
00:05:20,159 --> 00:05:22,919
Every time you study,
you're either sleepy or hungry.

124
00:05:26,159 --> 00:05:26,760
Off you go.

125
00:05:27,426 --> 00:05:28,390
Thank you, Mr. Sun.

126
00:05:29,960 --> 00:05:31,660
If you studied
with this much enthusiasm,

127
00:05:31,670 --> 00:05:33,070
you'd have been in college long ago.

128
00:05:33,071 --> 00:05:34,310
Something must be wrong with me

129
00:05:34,315 --> 00:05:35,982
if I'm not excited about eating,
Mr. Sun.

130
00:05:36,115 --> 00:05:37,426
You're not going to the canteen?

131
00:05:37,599 --> 00:05:38,520
I brought my own lunch.

132
00:05:42,520 --> 00:05:44,479
You're so skinny. Why are you dieting?

133
00:05:44,599 --> 00:05:46,120
I'm not dieting.

134
00:05:46,479 --> 00:05:48,239
My health check report
came out yesterday.

135
00:05:49,919 --> 00:05:51,159
I have three highs.

136
00:05:51,440 --> 00:05:52,880
The doctor said I need to eat light.

137
00:05:53,440 --> 00:05:55,039
This is too light.

138
00:05:55,404 --> 00:05:57,590
Teaching senior year
is already exhausting enough.

139
00:05:58,599 --> 00:05:59,200
Try this.

140
00:05:59,200 --> 00:05:59,680
Don't.

141
00:06:00,279 --> 00:06:01,520
My dad made this.

142
00:06:01,839 --> 00:06:03,159
This is his secret recipe.

143
00:06:03,479 --> 00:06:04,799
He sells out every day.

144
00:06:05,359 --> 00:06:06,320
I have three highs.

145
00:06:06,760 --> 00:06:07,320
The doctor...

146
00:06:07,320 --> 00:06:08,080
Try it.

147
00:06:09,320 --> 00:06:10,120
Try one.

148
00:06:10,719 --> 00:06:11,960
Just think the report

149
00:06:11,960 --> 00:06:12,919
comes out tomorrow.

150
00:06:15,120 --> 00:06:15,839
Minghui,

151
00:06:16,919 --> 00:06:17,719
you can't

152
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:19,080
fool yourself like this.

153
00:06:19,599 --> 00:06:20,359
Mr. Sun,

154
00:06:20,760 --> 00:06:21,760
sometimes,

155
00:06:21,960 --> 00:06:23,239
you need to play dumb.

156
00:06:24,039 --> 00:06:24,680
I'm leaving.

157
00:06:26,520 --> 00:06:27,200
Minghui.

158
00:06:29,560 --> 00:06:31,159
You're getting me in trouble.

159
00:06:51,640 --> 00:06:53,039
Sometimes, I have to play dumb.

160
00:07:05,200 --> 00:07:06,760
It's for you. No need to thank me.

161
00:07:20,919 --> 00:07:22,640
The school really does think of us.

162
00:07:22,799 --> 00:07:24,960
Feeding us veggies and tofu every day.

163
00:07:24,960 --> 00:07:26,599
Just the sight of these makes me sick.

164
00:07:26,599 --> 00:07:28,000
I'd rather have pickles today.

165
00:07:28,071 --> 00:07:29,390
We're not allowed to eat outside.

166
00:07:29,399 --> 00:07:30,719
This is all we get.

167
00:07:42,159 --> 00:07:43,229
You gave me the pork chop.

168
00:07:43,230 --> 00:07:44,137
What will you eat?

169
00:07:44,680 --> 00:07:46,440
It's fine. I eat this
at home all the time.

170
00:07:51,799 --> 00:07:52,440
Good?

171
00:07:53,604 --> 00:07:55,382
If you like it,
I'll bring you some tomorrow.

172
00:08:04,839 --> 00:08:05,440
Dad,

173
00:08:05,760 --> 00:08:07,640
can you braise
ten more pork chops for me?

174
00:08:07,640 --> 00:08:08,982
I'll bring them to school.

175
00:08:09,399 --> 00:08:10,159
Ten?

176
00:08:10,719 --> 00:08:11,760
Why do you need so many?

177
00:08:11,760 --> 00:08:13,440
Mr. Sun tutors me after class,

178
00:08:13,440 --> 00:08:14,880
and the class rep helps me review.

179
00:08:14,880 --> 00:08:16,200
I should treat them.

180
00:08:16,880 --> 00:08:17,560
True.

181
00:08:18,399 --> 00:08:19,399
Is ten enough?

182
00:08:19,399 --> 00:08:20,479
I'll make you more.

183
00:08:20,719 --> 00:08:21,279
That's enough.

184
00:08:21,293 --> 00:08:22,830
It won't feel special if it's too much.

185
00:08:25,320 --> 00:08:26,599
This brat.

186
00:08:27,248 --> 00:08:28,710
You'd better study hard enough

187
00:08:28,719 --> 00:08:30,080
to be worth twenty yuan.

188
00:08:30,960 --> 00:08:31,359
Come on.

189
00:08:31,359 --> 00:08:32,759
Be late, and you'll
miss Shen's pork chops.

190
00:08:32,759 --> 00:08:33,960
They melt in your mouths.

191
00:08:33,960 --> 00:08:35,119
It's amazing.

192
00:08:35,320 --> 00:08:35,999
You know what?

193
00:08:35,999 --> 00:08:37,359
Especially for you girls,

194
00:08:37,519 --> 00:08:38,519
we only use

195
00:08:38,519 --> 00:08:39,560
lean meat.

196
00:08:39,560 --> 00:08:41,080
It won't make you gain weight.

197
00:08:41,400 --> 00:08:42,280
Good?

198
00:08:42,280 --> 00:08:43,320
- Good!
- Good!

199
00:08:45,115 --> 00:08:46,750
If you like it, come again tomorrow.

200
00:08:46,750 --> 00:08:47,982
There'll be more tomorrow.

201
00:08:49,719 --> 00:08:50,960
Don't push, everyone.

202
00:08:51,119 --> 00:08:52,759
Don't push, everyone.

203
00:08:53,315 --> 00:08:54,800
- Don't push.
- Don't push, everyone.

204
00:08:56,400 --> 00:08:57,759
- Don't push.
- Don't push.

205
00:08:58,180 --> 00:08:59,340
(48 days until
the National College Entrance Exam)

206
00:08:59,340 --> 00:09:00,460
(47 days until
the National College Entrance Exam)

207
00:09:00,460 --> 00:09:01,540
(46 days until
the National College Entrance Exam)

208
00:09:01,540 --> 00:09:02,420
(45 days until
the National College Entrance Exam)

209
00:09:03,719 --> 00:09:04,759
Excuse me.

210
00:09:05,400 --> 00:09:07,119
Coming through. No more.

211
00:09:07,440 --> 00:09:08,440
No more for today.

212
00:09:17,239 --> 00:09:18,400
(Free tasting of Shen's Pork Chops)
Where is he?

213
00:09:18,400 --> 00:09:20,848
If I don't eat those pork chops today,
I won't be able to sleep.

214
00:09:20,871 --> 00:09:21,960
Where's Shen Minghui?

215
00:09:34,719 --> 00:09:35,879
(Pork Chop Guide)
Read this.

216
00:09:43,639 --> 00:09:45,320
Where's the principal, Mr. Hua?

217
00:09:46,960 --> 00:09:47,680
Mr. Sun,

218
00:09:47,960 --> 00:09:49,759
is Shen Minghui from your class?

219
00:09:50,879 --> 00:09:51,320
Yes.

220
00:09:51,839 --> 00:09:53,440
This brat disrupted school order.

221
00:09:53,440 --> 00:09:55,080
The canteen is a mess now.

222
00:09:55,999 --> 00:09:56,719
What did he do?

223
00:09:57,115 --> 00:09:59,115
He was giving out free pork chops
in the canteen.

224
00:10:00,719 --> 00:10:01,200
That's it?

225
00:10:03,280 --> 00:10:05,879
You came here
to complain to the principal over that?

226
00:10:06,119 --> 00:10:07,400
Listen, Mr. Hua.

227
00:10:07,639 --> 00:10:09,440
We senior year teachers are swamped.

228
00:10:09,560 --> 00:10:10,990
The homeroom teachers are even busier.

229
00:10:10,999 --> 00:10:11,639
Look.

230
00:10:11,639 --> 00:10:13,200
I barely have time to drink water.

231
00:10:13,320 --> 00:10:14,200
Let me tell you this.

232
00:10:14,440 --> 00:10:16,440
His family runs a restaurant.

233
00:10:16,440 --> 00:10:18,080
Their pork chops are really good.

234
00:10:18,080 --> 00:10:19,119
I've had them too.

235
00:10:19,119 --> 00:10:20,719
But there's a problem now.

236
00:10:21,560 --> 00:10:23,400
Students come to the canteen

237
00:10:23,759 --> 00:10:25,440
later and later

238
00:10:25,440 --> 00:10:26,440
just for the pork chops.

239
00:10:26,440 --> 00:10:28,182
They're missing
the afternoon study hall.

240
00:10:28,182 --> 00:10:29,590
There's this "Pork Chop Guide"

241
00:10:29,599 --> 00:10:30,680
going viral.

242
00:10:30,960 --> 00:10:32,250
It's just one tiny piece of meat,

243
00:10:32,250 --> 00:10:33,960
and they treat it like
some kind of panacea.

244
00:10:33,960 --> 00:10:34,879
Does that make sense?

245
00:10:34,999 --> 00:10:36,119
This is a school.

246
00:10:36,119 --> 00:10:37,440
A place to study.

247
00:10:37,440 --> 00:10:38,759
Not to dine out!

248
00:10:38,759 --> 00:10:40,359
Alright. Stop shouting.

249
00:10:40,359 --> 00:10:40,999
I got it.

250
00:10:48,200 --> 00:10:49,800
Alright, I'll handle it.

251
00:10:51,920 --> 00:10:53,239
Mr. Pan, you wanted to see me?

252
00:10:54,560 --> 00:10:55,639
Mr. Sun,

253
00:10:55,879 --> 00:10:57,680
Mr. Pan's phone
has been ringing off the hook.

254
00:10:57,693 --> 00:10:59,710
Students are protesting
about the canteen food.

255
00:10:59,719 --> 00:11:01,080
Today they want pork chops,

256
00:11:01,080 --> 00:11:02,440
tomorrow they'll want hotpot,

257
00:11:02,440 --> 00:11:04,570
and the day after,
they'll demand Alaskan King Crab.

258
00:11:10,400 --> 00:11:11,040
Mr. Pan,

259
00:11:11,359 --> 00:11:13,719
Sheng Minghui must be
dealt with seriously.

260
00:11:14,560 --> 00:11:16,160
Giving him a demerit would be too light.

261
00:11:16,479 --> 00:11:17,210
I heard he has been

262
00:11:17,220 --> 00:11:19,471
in high school for five years
and still hasn't graduated.

263
00:11:19,471 --> 00:11:20,893
He's undoubtedly a trouble.

264
00:11:21,040 --> 00:11:22,759
We might as well take this chance to...

265
00:11:23,040 --> 00:11:23,719
Mr. Hua,

266
00:11:24,040 --> 00:11:26,839
can I ask what exactly you're trying
to do with him?

267
00:11:27,582 --> 00:11:28,510
No need to say it.

268
00:11:29,479 --> 00:11:30,080
I get it.

269
00:11:30,479 --> 00:11:31,479
I don't get it.

270
00:11:32,320 --> 00:11:33,239
Let me ask you.

271
00:11:33,826 --> 00:11:35,350
Did he take money for those pork chops?

272
00:11:36,160 --> 00:11:37,040
Did he?

273
00:11:39,719 --> 00:11:40,440
No, he didn't.

274
00:11:40,440 --> 00:11:42,337
Did any student get sick
from eating them?

275
00:11:42,800 --> 00:11:43,519
No, they didn't.

276
00:11:43,519 --> 00:11:44,440
Then what's the problem?

277
00:11:45,800 --> 00:11:46,879
I think

278
00:11:47,630 --> 00:11:48,782
if someone's willing to

279
00:11:49,160 --> 00:11:50,599
share something good

280
00:11:50,999 --> 00:11:52,359
with others,

281
00:11:52,359 --> 00:11:53,519
what's wrong with that?

282
00:11:54,200 --> 00:11:55,560
I'd say that's pretty noble.

283
00:11:56,804 --> 00:11:57,990
What do you think, Mr. Pan?

284
00:12:03,280 --> 00:12:03,999
Mr. Hua.

285
00:12:05,400 --> 00:12:07,239
Our school's meals

286
00:12:07,960 --> 00:12:09,400
aren't great.

287
00:12:10,639 --> 00:12:12,440
Students have complaints

288
00:12:12,839 --> 00:12:13,999
and want something better.

289
00:12:14,719 --> 00:12:15,479
Is that a problem?

290
00:12:15,479 --> 00:12:15,960
No.

291
00:12:16,479 --> 00:12:17,040
Not a problem.

292
00:12:17,200 --> 00:12:18,479
It's only natural, right?

293
00:12:18,479 --> 00:12:19,359
Yes.

294
00:12:19,359 --> 00:12:20,920
And what's your job?

295
00:12:21,719 --> 00:12:24,759
Your job is to find every way possible

296
00:12:24,759 --> 00:12:26,519
to make those pork chops for them.

297
00:12:27,040 --> 00:12:27,680
Yes, right.

298
00:12:27,680 --> 00:12:29,200
Stop being sarcastic.

299
00:12:29,400 --> 00:12:31,239
Why meddle in other people's business?

300
00:12:31,320 --> 00:12:31,879
Yes.

301
00:12:34,400 --> 00:12:35,160
Mr. Sun,

302
00:12:35,960 --> 00:12:37,599
what's your job?

303
00:12:39,160 --> 00:12:41,599
I suppose I don't need
to say more about Shen Minghui.

304
00:12:41,800 --> 00:12:42,280
Got it.

305
00:12:42,280 --> 00:12:43,920
I'll talk to him.

306
00:12:44,137 --> 00:12:44,982
I have class later.

307
00:12:45,960 --> 00:12:46,719
I have class.

308
00:12:50,920 --> 00:12:51,560
Brother-in-law.

309
00:12:51,719 --> 00:12:52,560
Mr. Hua!

310
00:12:53,759 --> 00:12:54,960
What do you call me at school?

311
00:12:54,960 --> 00:12:55,680
Mr. Pan.

312
00:12:59,639 --> 00:13:01,160
The Shen's pork chops

313
00:13:01,359 --> 00:13:03,040
are slow-braised in seasoned stock.

314
00:13:03,260 --> 00:13:04,750
I doubt they can make good pork chops.

315
00:13:05,200 --> 00:13:06,080
What do we do?

316
00:13:06,080 --> 00:13:06,519
Yeah.

317
00:13:06,519 --> 00:13:07,879
We can't run to your restaurant

318
00:13:07,879 --> 00:13:09,589
after school every day.

319
00:13:09,590 --> 00:13:11,399
By the time
we finish the evening study hall,

320
00:13:11,400 --> 00:13:12,090
it's already closed.

321
00:13:12,093 --> 00:13:12,710
Right.

322
00:13:12,719 --> 00:13:15,359
You whetted our appetite,
and then stopped serving it.

323
00:13:15,719 --> 00:13:17,080
That's too irresponsible.

324
00:13:17,080 --> 00:13:18,440
I brought the pork chops to school

325
00:13:18,440 --> 00:13:19,200
out of kindness,

326
00:13:19,200 --> 00:13:20,160
and now it's my fault.

327
00:13:20,382 --> 00:13:21,560
You've really disappointed me.

328
00:13:22,040 --> 00:13:24,160
Minghui, you're the eldest son
of the Shen family.

329
00:13:24,160 --> 00:13:25,200
You can find a way, right?

330
00:13:25,200 --> 00:13:27,350
Even if I were the crown prince,
there's nothing I could do.

331
00:13:27,360 --> 00:13:28,880
The school doesn't belong to my family.

332
00:13:28,893 --> 00:13:30,293
I can't sell pork chops in school.

333
00:13:30,879 --> 00:13:32,320
I'm here to study,

334
00:13:32,680 --> 00:13:33,960
not to run a business.

335
00:13:33,960 --> 00:13:34,639
Wait, Minghui.

336
00:13:34,639 --> 00:13:35,519
- Minghui.
- Minghui.

337
00:13:40,639 --> 00:13:41,359
Mr. Pan,

338
00:13:41,719 --> 00:13:42,759
I have three highs.

339
00:13:43,119 --> 00:13:44,479
The doctor told me to eat light.

340
00:13:44,800 --> 00:13:45,680
Why don't you try one?

341
00:13:47,479 --> 00:13:49,040
At least say something.

342
00:13:50,479 --> 00:13:51,839
I'll be honest with you.

343
00:13:52,759 --> 00:13:53,879
I'm looking forward to

344
00:13:53,879 --> 00:13:55,119
your Alaskan king crab.

345
00:13:55,119 --> 00:13:56,119
Oh, come on.

346
00:13:56,119 --> 00:13:56,999
Look at this.

347
00:13:57,999 --> 00:14:00,160
Shen Minghui isn't
as simple as he seems to be.

348
00:14:01,080 --> 00:14:01,719
Mr. Pan,

349
00:14:02,119 --> 00:14:03,920
this is a premeditated marketing plan.

350
00:14:04,479 --> 00:14:06,160
He's been waiting for a chance

351
00:14:06,400 --> 00:14:08,040
at Nanzhou High School for five years.

352
00:14:09,200 --> 00:14:11,160
Is he going to make his move now?

353
00:14:11,160 --> 00:14:12,800
He already did once.

354
00:14:12,810 --> 00:14:15,090
During the military training,
he organized a group buy on Cola

355
00:14:15,093 --> 00:14:16,026
and was punished.

356
00:14:16,160 --> 00:14:17,680
If we don't teach him a lesson,

357
00:14:18,080 --> 00:14:19,879
he'll break the law someday.

358
00:14:20,239 --> 00:14:20,920
Mr. Hua,

359
00:14:21,320 --> 00:14:22,879
don't exaggerate.

360
00:14:23,080 --> 00:14:23,879
And I'm warning you,

361
00:14:24,119 --> 00:14:25,879
if that boy hears what you say,

362
00:14:25,999 --> 00:14:26,920
you're in trouble.

363
00:14:27,604 --> 00:14:29,204
What could be possible do to me?

364
00:14:29,204 --> 00:14:30,271
I'm telling the truth.

365
00:14:30,271 --> 00:14:30,990
Yes.

366
00:14:30,999 --> 00:14:31,560
Mr. Hua,

367
00:14:32,400 --> 00:14:34,839
if you can't make

368
00:14:34,839 --> 00:14:36,200
good pork chops yourself,

369
00:14:36,759 --> 00:14:38,479
you might as well

370
00:14:38,999 --> 00:14:41,440
order from Shen Minghui's family.

371
00:14:41,440 --> 00:14:42,040
Alright?

372
00:14:42,040 --> 00:14:42,920
That's a good idea.

373
00:14:42,920 --> 00:14:43,999
I agree.

374
00:14:45,239 --> 00:14:45,999
That's a good idea,

375
00:14:46,320 --> 00:14:48,040
but it's inappropriate for me

376
00:14:48,239 --> 00:14:49,440
to do this.

377
00:14:50,719 --> 00:14:51,359
Me?

378
00:14:51,999 --> 00:14:52,800
Yeah.

379
00:14:52,999 --> 00:14:54,560
Mr. Pan made this decision.

380
00:14:55,280 --> 00:14:55,839
I...

381
00:14:56,280 --> 00:14:58,440
What's it got to do with me?

382
00:14:58,440 --> 00:15:00,320
I didn't even get a single bite.

383
00:15:03,080 --> 00:15:04,719
You're dating his sister.

384
00:15:06,320 --> 00:15:07,519
Not his sister.

385
00:15:07,759 --> 00:15:09,119
It's his brother-in-law's sister.

386
00:15:10,200 --> 00:15:11,280
Whatever. I'm confused.

387
00:15:11,519 --> 00:15:12,560
You're a family, anyway.

388
00:15:13,004 --> 00:15:14,471
This needs to be settled today.

389
00:15:14,639 --> 00:15:15,040
Hurry.

390
00:15:17,960 --> 00:15:18,719
Mr. Hu,

391
00:15:19,519 --> 00:15:21,080
I'm just a student.

392
00:15:21,626 --> 00:15:23,826
The national college entrance exam
is coming up.

393
00:15:23,839 --> 00:15:25,879
My main job is to study.

394
00:15:26,400 --> 00:15:27,920
I don't have time to sell pork chops.

395
00:15:28,719 --> 00:15:30,239
All I'm asking

396
00:15:30,239 --> 00:15:31,599
is for you to tell your dad.

397
00:15:31,599 --> 00:15:32,839
It won't affect your studies.

398
00:15:32,839 --> 00:15:33,879
My dad's restaurant

399
00:15:34,239 --> 00:15:35,400
is tiny.

400
00:15:36,119 --> 00:15:37,719
My parents work from morning till night.

401
00:15:37,760 --> 00:15:39,471
They can barely keep up with the orders,

402
00:15:39,471 --> 00:15:40,750
let alone supply the canteen.

403
00:15:40,759 --> 00:15:42,040
We don't have the capacity.

404
00:15:45,080 --> 00:15:46,080
That's a problem.

405
00:15:47,479 --> 00:15:48,999
Is it possible

406
00:15:49,599 --> 00:15:51,800
for your dad to hire someone to help?

407
00:15:52,160 --> 00:15:52,839
Mr. Hu,

408
00:15:53,839 --> 00:15:55,519
do you know how expensive that is?

409
00:15:56,879 --> 00:15:57,839
I don't know.

410
00:15:57,893 --> 00:15:59,110
Let me break it down for you.

411
00:15:59,960 --> 00:16:01,280
One kilogram of pork chop

412
00:16:01,999 --> 00:16:03,040
costs 34 yuan.

413
00:16:03,582 --> 00:16:05,660
You can cut at most eight pieces
from one kilogram.

414
00:16:05,839 --> 00:16:06,680
That means

415
00:16:07,359 --> 00:16:10,839
each piece costs 4.25 yuan.

416
00:16:11,080 --> 00:16:12,239
Then you add

417
00:16:12,519 --> 00:16:16,200
labor, rent, seasoning,

418
00:16:16,879 --> 00:16:17,879
water, electricity, gas,

419
00:16:18,200 --> 00:16:19,839
taxes, and waste.

420
00:16:19,839 --> 00:16:20,999
With all the costs,

421
00:16:21,639 --> 00:16:23,200
one finished chop

422
00:16:23,519 --> 00:16:24,960
has to sell for at least nine yuan

423
00:16:25,479 --> 00:16:27,119
for us to cover the costs.

424
00:16:27,560 --> 00:16:28,639
At Shen's Restaurant,

425
00:16:29,359 --> 00:16:30,960
we sell one pork chop for 15 yuan.

426
00:16:31,182 --> 00:16:32,350
That's not too much, right?

427
00:16:33,160 --> 00:16:33,999
Fair price.

428
00:16:34,239 --> 00:16:35,320
If we hire one more person,

429
00:16:35,920 --> 00:16:37,719
even a part-time worker,

430
00:16:38,200 --> 00:16:39,639
it'll cost about 3,000 yuan a month.

431
00:16:40,920 --> 00:16:42,639
Add that into the cost,

432
00:16:43,639 --> 00:16:45,119
each chop wouldn't be 15 yuan anymore.

433
00:16:46,119 --> 00:16:47,440
It'd be at least

434
00:16:48,200 --> 00:16:49,400
18 yuan.

435
00:16:49,400 --> 00:16:49,960
That's right.

436
00:16:51,239 --> 00:16:51,999
Mr. Hu,

437
00:16:52,719 --> 00:16:54,200
if the school really wants us

438
00:16:54,200 --> 00:16:55,719
to supply pork chops,

439
00:16:56,093 --> 00:16:57,800
we can only do a hundred pieces a day.

440
00:16:57,937 --> 00:16:59,560
We can't manage any more than that.

441
00:17:00,200 --> 00:17:01,879
My parents aren't robots.

442
00:17:04,120 --> 00:17:06,239
Alright. I understand the situation now.

443
00:17:06,239 --> 00:17:07,799
I'll report it to the principal.

444
00:17:08,079 --> 00:17:08,640
Go home

445
00:17:08,640 --> 00:17:10,400
and thank your parents.

446
00:17:10,559 --> 00:17:11,400
Alright, Mr. Hu.

447
00:17:11,400 --> 00:17:12,319
I'll tell them.

448
00:17:17,479 --> 00:17:18,160
Take care.

449
00:17:22,319 --> 00:17:22,999
Yes!

450
00:17:23,360 --> 00:17:23,960
What?

451
00:17:25,239 --> 00:17:28,279
You represented the school
to talk business with Shen Minghui?

452
00:17:29,960 --> 00:17:32,640
The principal found out
he's your relative,

453
00:17:33,600 --> 00:17:34,960
so he asked me to handle it.

454
00:17:37,400 --> 00:17:39,600
Mr. Hu, I'm really sorry.

455
00:17:39,640 --> 00:17:40,999
I can't believe our family

456
00:17:40,999 --> 00:17:42,559
has a relative like that.

457
00:17:43,160 --> 00:17:44,039
Oh my.

458
00:17:44,640 --> 00:17:45,640
How did the talk go?

459
00:17:45,840 --> 00:17:46,640
It's settled.

460
00:17:46,880 --> 00:17:48,279
The school cafeteria

461
00:17:48,279 --> 00:17:48,960
is going to sell

462
00:17:48,960 --> 00:17:50,640
Shen's pork chops.

463
00:17:50,640 --> 00:17:52,600
That family sure knows
how to make a profit.

464
00:17:52,600 --> 00:17:53,400
I must say,

465
00:17:53,400 --> 00:17:54,640
Shen Minghui

466
00:17:55,039 --> 00:17:56,400
may not be good at studying,

467
00:17:56,400 --> 00:17:58,269
but when it comes to calculating costs,

468
00:17:58,270 --> 00:17:59,182
he's quick-witted.

469
00:17:59,479 --> 00:18:00,640
Everyone in that family

470
00:18:00,640 --> 00:18:01,880
is smart.

471
00:18:02,999 --> 00:18:03,880
Meiqi...

472
00:18:03,880 --> 00:18:05,293
- It's done?
- Where's the switch?

473
00:18:05,337 --> 00:18:05,937
I got it.

474
00:18:09,239 --> 00:18:09,840
Well done!

475
00:18:10,279 --> 00:18:12,400
- You're amazing, Mr. Hu.
- You're amazing.

476
00:18:12,400 --> 00:18:13,120
That's nothing.

477
00:18:13,120 --> 00:18:14,120
The light is on.

478
00:18:14,120 --> 00:18:15,479
Anyone can do it, Mrs. Feng.

479
00:18:15,719 --> 00:18:17,160
No, I can't.

480
00:18:17,479 --> 00:18:19,680
No way. Anyone can change it.

481
00:18:22,279 --> 00:18:24,079
He's so honest.

482
00:18:24,400 --> 00:18:25,400
A little silly.

483
00:18:26,160 --> 00:18:27,039
Mrs. Feng, Meiqi,

484
00:18:27,039 --> 00:18:28,880
if there's nothing else, I'll get going.

485
00:18:28,880 --> 00:18:30,519
Don't leave yet. It's still early.

486
00:18:30,737 --> 00:18:32,510
I need to head back
for my driving practice.

487
00:18:32,519 --> 00:18:34,160
Evening lessons are cheaper.

488
00:18:34,319 --> 00:18:35,960
My road test is in a few days.

489
00:18:35,960 --> 00:18:37,319
I must pass this time.

490
00:18:37,337 --> 00:18:38,550
You're good at planning things.

491
00:18:38,559 --> 00:18:39,519
Hold on.

492
00:18:39,519 --> 00:18:40,239
Miss Mao,

493
00:18:40,960 --> 00:18:42,239
bring out the white fungus soup.

494
00:18:42,799 --> 00:18:43,279
Coming.

495
00:18:43,279 --> 00:18:44,719
The weather is dry,

496
00:18:44,880 --> 00:18:46,279
so I made some white fungus soup.

497
00:18:46,360 --> 00:18:48,120
Drink it. It'll soothe your throat.

498
00:18:48,120 --> 00:18:49,600
Thank you.

499
00:18:49,600 --> 00:18:50,360
Drink it.

500
00:18:51,440 --> 00:18:52,559
How is it?

501
00:18:52,799 --> 00:18:53,640
Drink slowly.

502
00:18:55,079 --> 00:18:55,640
It's good.

503
00:18:57,880 --> 00:18:58,880
Slowly.

504
00:19:02,760 --> 00:19:03,915
Do you want another bowl?

505
00:19:04,479 --> 00:19:05,079
No thanks.

506
00:19:05,079 --> 00:19:06,759
I'd better get going for practice.

507
00:19:06,759 --> 00:19:07,559
Alright.

508
00:19:07,559 --> 00:19:09,039
I'm off, Mrs. Feng.

509
00:19:09,160 --> 00:19:10,039
Okay.

510
00:19:10,039 --> 00:19:10,880
See you, Meiqi.

511
00:19:12,400 --> 00:19:13,640
Careful.

512
00:19:14,640 --> 00:19:16,880
Be careful on the road.

513
00:19:16,880 --> 00:19:17,840
Alright, Mrs. Feng.

514
00:19:19,479 --> 00:19:20,640
Clean up, Miss Mao.

515
00:19:22,400 --> 00:19:23,600
Give Mingzhu a call.

516
00:19:23,759 --> 00:19:24,600
It's late.

517
00:19:24,600 --> 00:19:25,719
Why isn't she home yet?

518
00:19:26,170 --> 00:19:27,800
She's staying at her parents' house
tonight.

519
00:19:27,804 --> 00:19:28,715
I forgot to tell you.

520
00:19:28,715 --> 00:19:29,400
Why?

521
00:19:29,640 --> 00:19:30,960
Why is she staying there again?

522
00:19:30,960 --> 00:19:32,509
What's so great about that place?

523
00:19:32,510 --> 00:19:34,293
That old house shakes from top to bottom

524
00:19:34,293 --> 00:19:35,515
with just one stomp.

525
00:19:35,515 --> 00:19:36,840
That's her home.

526
00:19:36,840 --> 00:19:37,880
Isn't this her home?

527
00:19:38,360 --> 00:19:41,039
Isn't this beautiful,
big house her home?

528
00:19:41,039 --> 00:19:42,880
We can't keep her
in a nice house like this.

529
00:19:42,880 --> 00:19:43,880
What does she want?

530
00:19:44,120 --> 00:19:45,400
And her brother too.

531
00:19:45,890 --> 00:19:47,999
I can't stand it.
The whole family always finds ways

532
00:19:47,999 --> 00:19:49,799
to take advantage of us.

533
00:19:49,799 --> 00:19:50,799
Unbelievable.

534
00:19:54,920 --> 00:19:55,880
Is it too hard?

535
00:19:56,160 --> 00:19:56,880
It feels great.

536
00:19:57,719 --> 00:19:58,319
Nice.

537
00:19:59,079 --> 00:19:59,799
Have some water.

538
00:20:00,999 --> 00:20:01,799
Shen Minghui,

539
00:20:02,048 --> 00:20:03,230
I'm gone for a few days,

540
00:20:03,239 --> 00:20:04,640
and you've become the big boss here?

541
00:20:06,999 --> 00:20:08,880
He pulled off a big one.

542
00:20:09,279 --> 00:20:10,279
What big one?

543
00:20:10,279 --> 00:20:12,079
He always brings pork chops to school.

544
00:20:12,400 --> 00:20:13,719
Now the school has started

545
00:20:14,039 --> 00:20:15,400
ordering from us.

546
00:20:15,600 --> 00:20:16,160
Really?

547
00:20:16,160 --> 00:20:17,719
A hundred pieces a day.

548
00:20:18,360 --> 00:20:19,680
Well done, Shen Minghui.

549
00:20:20,120 --> 00:20:20,799
Keep it low-key.

550
00:20:21,160 --> 00:20:22,039
Keep it low-key.

551
00:20:22,039 --> 00:20:23,279
Didn't I say

552
00:20:23,279 --> 00:20:25,960
your brother has a head for business?

553
00:20:25,960 --> 00:20:26,479
Dad,

554
00:20:27,079 --> 00:20:28,079
when I was little,

555
00:20:28,079 --> 00:20:29,360
you always called me a blockhead.

556
00:20:29,360 --> 00:20:30,400
I still remember that.

557
00:20:30,880 --> 00:20:32,239
That was to motivate you.

558
00:20:32,640 --> 00:20:34,239
You're slow with studying.

559
00:20:35,559 --> 00:20:36,519
I have raised

560
00:20:36,519 --> 00:20:37,999
a business prodigy.

561
00:20:38,519 --> 00:20:39,479
Keep this up,

562
00:20:39,479 --> 00:20:40,960
and you'll be a billionaire.

563
00:20:41,239 --> 00:20:42,269
Come. Sit down.

564
00:20:42,270 --> 00:20:43,315
I'll give you a massage.

565
00:20:43,680 --> 00:20:45,719
Since the business is doing so well,

566
00:20:45,719 --> 00:20:46,400
shouldn't we

567
00:20:47,200 --> 00:20:48,239
hire someone to help?

568
00:20:49,719 --> 00:20:51,680
We're not doing a big business.

569
00:20:51,920 --> 00:20:52,880
I can handle it.

570
00:20:52,880 --> 00:20:53,960
Every morning I go to school,

571
00:20:53,960 --> 00:20:55,315
I deliver the pork chops myself.

572
00:20:55,559 --> 00:20:56,640
That saves delivery costs.

573
00:20:56,759 --> 00:20:58,559
When did you get so sensible?

574
00:20:59,400 --> 00:21:02,239
Didn't someone just call me "big boss"?

575
00:21:02,640 --> 00:21:03,559
Have you seen a boss

576
00:21:03,559 --> 00:21:05,840
riding a bike to deliver pork chops
every day?

577
00:21:05,920 --> 00:21:06,519
Alright.

578
00:21:06,519 --> 00:21:08,079
You're our God of Money.

579
00:21:09,239 --> 00:21:09,799
Dad,

580
00:21:10,115 --> 00:21:12,582
what's the first thing we'll do
once we make good money?

581
00:21:13,719 --> 00:21:14,600
What else could it be?

582
00:21:15,160 --> 00:21:16,479
Save it for you two.

583
00:21:17,079 --> 00:21:17,680
Wrong.

584
00:21:18,239 --> 00:21:20,279
The first thing is to buy Mom

585
00:21:20,519 --> 00:21:23,440
a family heirloom
that she can pass down.

586
00:21:23,671 --> 00:21:24,960
Then we'll buy a pair of them.

587
00:21:25,026 --> 00:21:26,140
That's right. A pair of them.

588
00:21:27,160 --> 00:21:27,719
Okay.

589
00:21:27,719 --> 00:21:30,900
(A Harmony Family Brings Prosperity)

590
00:21:31,519 --> 00:21:32,079
Miss Xu.

591
00:21:32,319 --> 00:21:33,120
Hello, Jin.

592
00:21:33,880 --> 00:21:34,440
Zhixia.

593
00:21:34,799 --> 00:21:35,440
Mr. Lu,

594
00:21:35,560 --> 00:21:37,160
I hope I'm not interrupting your work.

595
00:21:37,160 --> 00:21:38,279
Not at all. Have a seat.

596
00:21:39,079 --> 00:21:40,759
You did us a big favor.

597
00:21:41,799 --> 00:21:43,079
I should be thanking you.

598
00:21:43,360 --> 00:21:44,550
Don't worry. I'm not here

599
00:21:44,559 --> 00:21:46,719
about the advertisement deal this time.

600
00:21:46,920 --> 00:21:48,300
The advertisement business is fine,

601
00:21:48,360 --> 00:21:49,719
but that'll wait till next quarter.

602
00:21:50,079 --> 00:21:51,400
Our ad budget for this quarter

603
00:21:51,400 --> 00:21:52,039
is all spent.

604
00:21:52,093 --> 00:21:53,470
It's allocated to Zhixia Speaks.

605
00:21:54,039 --> 00:21:55,239
Worth it, wouldn't you say?

606
00:21:56,120 --> 00:21:57,079
You really

607
00:21:57,400 --> 00:21:58,759
don't mince words.

608
00:21:59,271 --> 00:22:00,471
Worth it, of course.

609
00:22:01,640 --> 00:22:02,479
What brings you here?

610
00:22:02,648 --> 00:22:04,493
As long as it's something
I can do, I'll help.

611
00:22:04,515 --> 00:22:05,710
Of course you can.

612
00:22:06,039 --> 00:22:10,160
I wanted to buy a few bottles
of thirty-year-old baijiu.

613
00:22:10,560 --> 00:22:11,550
You don't have to buy it.

614
00:22:11,559 --> 00:22:12,519
Just take a carton.

615
00:22:12,519 --> 00:22:13,120
No, no.

616
00:22:13,120 --> 00:22:14,600
I know the baijiu is expensive.

617
00:22:14,648 --> 00:22:16,360
You can't even get it
without connections.

618
00:22:16,479 --> 00:22:18,360
That's why I came straight to you.

619
00:22:19,471 --> 00:22:20,680
How many bottles do you need?

620
00:22:21,360 --> 00:22:22,400
Four will do.

621
00:22:22,999 --> 00:22:24,759
My husband's competing for promotion.

622
00:22:24,759 --> 00:22:26,039
I'm trying to smooth things over.

623
00:22:26,880 --> 00:22:27,479
Zhixia,

624
00:22:27,719 --> 00:22:29,479
you're really capable.

625
00:22:30,999 --> 00:22:31,600
Jin.

626
00:22:32,880 --> 00:22:33,519
Mr. Lu.

627
00:22:36,200 --> 00:22:38,760
Get four bottles
of Rufeng Thirty-Year-Old Liquor

628
00:22:38,760 --> 00:22:39,604
for Zhixia.

629
00:22:39,999 --> 00:22:40,840
Got it, Mr. Lu.

630
00:22:46,999 --> 00:22:47,960
This is premium bajiu.

631
00:22:47,982 --> 00:22:49,640
Give two bottles each
to Mr. Yu and Mr. Li.

632
00:22:49,640 --> 00:22:50,079
Hurry up.

633
00:22:50,079 --> 00:22:51,960
I wrapped them up well.
No one will notice. Quick.

634
00:22:51,960 --> 00:22:53,229
The promotion committee

635
00:22:53,230 --> 00:22:55,337
keeps warning us not to do
anything under the table.

636
00:22:55,360 --> 00:22:56,790
Be discreet.

637
00:22:59,719 --> 00:23:00,880
Fine.

638
00:23:04,319 --> 00:23:05,999
Is it for your uncle's birthday?

639
00:23:06,479 --> 00:23:06,999
Yeah.

640
00:23:08,279 --> 00:23:10,039
My father passed away when I was a kid.

641
00:23:10,200 --> 00:23:12,070
My mom left me with my grandma

642
00:23:12,071 --> 00:23:14,448
before she went abroad to study
and never came back.

643
00:23:14,799 --> 00:23:16,200
So I was basically an orphan.

644
00:23:19,239 --> 00:23:20,880
But my uncle is really good to me.

645
00:23:21,048 --> 00:23:22,790
He always encouraged me
to go to med school

646
00:23:22,804 --> 00:23:25,137
and even paid my tuition
without letting my aunt know.

647
00:23:25,360 --> 00:23:26,400
If it weren't for him,

648
00:23:27,519 --> 00:23:28,640
I wouldn't be a doctor.

649
00:23:29,880 --> 00:23:31,719
Then you should do
something nice for him.

650
00:23:33,960 --> 00:23:36,400
He's a proud man
and cares about appearances.

651
00:23:36,600 --> 00:23:38,759
That's why I want to give him the best.

652
00:23:39,120 --> 00:23:39,799
Don't worry.

653
00:23:39,871 --> 00:23:41,160
I'll make all the arrangements.

654
00:23:41,559 --> 00:23:42,239
Thank you.

655
00:23:44,960 --> 00:23:45,920
This banquet hall

656
00:23:45,920 --> 00:23:47,719
usually seats ten tables,

657
00:23:47,960 --> 00:23:49,799
but we can add up to twelve if needed.

658
00:23:49,871 --> 00:23:51,550
Miss Shen, here's the menu
you asked for.

659
00:23:51,559 --> 00:23:52,360
Alright, thank you.

660
00:23:53,600 --> 00:23:54,719
Here are the set menus.

661
00:23:54,719 --> 00:23:55,840
Have a look.

662
00:23:55,960 --> 00:23:58,071
If there's anything you don't like,
I can change it.

663
00:23:58,160 --> 00:23:58,990
Two sets?

664
00:24:01,279 --> 00:24:02,920
Can I change stir-fried shredded tofu

665
00:24:02,920 --> 00:24:04,400
to blanched shredded tofu?

666
00:24:04,960 --> 00:24:05,799
He prefers that.

667
00:24:06,360 --> 00:24:07,319
Of course.

668
00:24:07,719 --> 00:24:08,600
I'll note that down.

669
00:24:10,239 --> 00:24:11,719
Do you need an emcee?

670
00:24:11,737 --> 00:24:12,640
To host the banquet?

671
00:24:13,200 --> 00:24:14,160
I can do that.

672
00:24:15,319 --> 00:24:15,960
You?

673
00:24:15,960 --> 00:24:16,719
Yeah.

674
00:24:16,719 --> 00:24:18,600
I was the emcee

675
00:24:18,600 --> 00:24:20,560
for my university's
centennial celebration.

676
00:24:21,160 --> 00:24:22,079
You don't look like it.

677
00:24:22,400 --> 00:24:23,279
It's true.

678
00:24:23,600 --> 00:24:25,239
I'm talented.

679
00:24:25,239 --> 00:24:27,239
I handle a mic as well as a scalpel.

680
00:24:28,640 --> 00:24:29,840
Is that Li Jingzhe?

681
00:24:31,519 --> 00:24:32,120
It's him.

682
00:24:32,360 --> 00:24:32,960
Jingzhe,

683
00:24:33,493 --> 00:24:34,826
what are you doing here?

684
00:24:35,440 --> 00:24:38,039
I came to check out the place.

685
00:24:38,239 --> 00:24:39,120
My cousin and his wife.

686
00:24:39,559 --> 00:24:40,279
Nice to meet you.

687
00:24:44,600 --> 00:24:45,519
Looks like

688
00:24:46,440 --> 00:24:47,799
I'm my dad's son.

689
00:24:47,799 --> 00:24:48,400
Yeah.

690
00:24:51,719 --> 00:24:52,559
Since you're here,

691
00:24:52,559 --> 00:24:53,719
take a look at the menu.

692
00:24:54,519 --> 00:24:55,799
Why are you butting in?

693
00:24:55,799 --> 00:24:56,559
Don't interrupt.

694
00:24:56,559 --> 00:24:57,719
We need to make things clear.

695
00:24:57,719 --> 00:24:58,719
Can you calm down?

696
00:25:02,360 --> 00:25:03,239
Jingzhe,

697
00:25:03,559 --> 00:25:04,559
you work at the hospital.

698
00:25:04,559 --> 00:25:05,719
Have you seen

699
00:25:05,719 --> 00:25:06,759
my dad's medical report?

700
00:25:08,160 --> 00:25:10,079
I have. Just some
pre-existing conditions.

701
00:25:10,440 --> 00:25:11,999
You say that so lightly.

702
00:25:11,999 --> 00:25:13,640
Those are the things that kill people.

703
00:25:14,559 --> 00:25:15,279
I know

704
00:25:15,559 --> 00:25:17,160
my dad's always treated you well,

705
00:25:17,160 --> 00:25:19,680
but we'll handle this banquet, okay?

706
00:25:20,999 --> 00:25:21,759
Sure.

707
00:25:23,120 --> 00:25:24,559
Since we ran into each other,

708
00:25:24,559 --> 00:25:26,319
let me remind you.

709
00:25:26,519 --> 00:25:27,680
Don't get confused.

710
00:25:27,999 --> 00:25:28,640
The inheritance

711
00:25:28,640 --> 00:25:30,600
goes to the son,

712
00:25:30,840 --> 00:25:31,840
not the nephew.

713
00:25:31,840 --> 00:25:33,239
You're overthinking it.

714
00:25:33,559 --> 00:25:35,279
I'm just checking the restaurant.

715
00:25:36,600 --> 00:25:38,440
Let's hope that's all it is.

716
00:25:40,360 --> 00:25:41,160
Jingzhe,

717
00:25:41,799 --> 00:25:43,120
you're busy with work.

718
00:25:43,640 --> 00:25:44,680
Don't worry

719
00:25:44,680 --> 00:25:45,999
about the birthday banquet.

720
00:25:46,559 --> 00:25:47,160
Miss,

721
00:25:47,160 --> 00:25:48,115
sorry for the trouble.

722
00:25:48,160 --> 00:25:50,470
We'll go back and discuss it,

723
00:25:50,470 --> 00:25:51,782
and then we'll get back to you.

724
00:26:05,239 --> 00:26:06,719
They took the whole thing over.

725
00:26:11,239 --> 00:26:12,160
Are you okay?

726
00:26:12,360 --> 00:26:13,079
I'm fine.

727
00:26:13,400 --> 00:26:14,479
Didn't you say

728
00:26:14,493 --> 00:26:16,582
no matter how hard things get,
they'll pass?

729
00:26:19,360 --> 00:26:20,640
After Jianqi passed away,

730
00:26:21,239 --> 00:26:23,519
I felt that nothing mattered more
than death.

731
00:26:24,279 --> 00:26:26,759
Now, I want to live well.

732
00:26:27,279 --> 00:26:29,319
So I'll try my best to feel okay.

733
00:26:30,239 --> 00:26:30,999
And?

734
00:26:30,999 --> 00:26:33,840
And I'm working hard, eating well,

735
00:26:34,026 --> 00:26:35,960
sleeping early, waking early,
enjoying good food,

736
00:26:35,960 --> 00:26:37,400
walking more, and getting sunlight.

737
00:26:38,079 --> 00:26:39,319
When I feel sad,

738
00:26:39,559 --> 00:26:40,920
I'll give myself a time limit.

739
00:26:41,519 --> 00:26:43,239
I can only cry for ten minutes.

740
00:26:45,279 --> 00:26:46,920
Then, as a man,

741
00:26:47,160 --> 00:26:48,960
I'll give myself five minutes.

742
00:26:49,604 --> 00:26:51,070
Men and women are equal on that.

743
00:26:54,319 --> 00:26:55,479
I'm getting off work soon.

744
00:26:55,915 --> 00:26:57,400
Let me take you to my dad's restaurant

745
00:26:57,400 --> 00:26:58,759
to try his signature dishes.

746
00:26:59,039 --> 00:26:59,759
Sure.

747
00:27:00,039 --> 00:27:00,799
Wait here.

748
00:27:00,799 --> 00:27:01,600
I'll go change.

749
00:27:11,039 --> 00:27:11,840
How is it?

750
00:27:12,160 --> 00:27:12,759
Delicious.

751
00:27:13,760 --> 00:27:14,550
Another dish again?

752
00:27:14,559 --> 00:27:15,759
Stir-fried shrimp.

753
00:27:16,004 --> 00:27:17,137
- Here you go.
- Mrs. Shen,

754
00:27:17,280 --> 00:27:18,360
there's way too much food.

755
00:27:18,360 --> 00:27:19,319
I can't eat anymore.

756
00:27:19,840 --> 00:27:21,200
It's not much. Take your time.

757
00:27:21,271 --> 00:27:22,010
Finish everything.

758
00:27:22,640 --> 00:27:23,799
He can't overeat.

759
00:27:23,799 --> 00:27:24,680
He's a doctor.

760
00:27:25,319 --> 00:27:27,200
Don't talk nonsense.
This is not overeating.

761
00:27:27,200 --> 00:27:28,400
Eating well is a blessing.

762
00:27:28,400 --> 00:27:30,319
Take your time and eat.
Eat as much as you want.

763
00:27:30,319 --> 00:27:30,920
Alright.

764
00:27:31,239 --> 00:27:32,400
Dr. Li,

765
00:27:32,880 --> 00:27:33,840
try this.

766
00:27:33,840 --> 00:27:35,279
I made this braised pork chop.

767
00:27:35,400 --> 00:27:36,880
This is my dad's signature dish.

768
00:27:37,680 --> 00:27:39,680
That's not my only signature dish.

769
00:27:40,400 --> 00:27:40,880
Dr. Li,

770
00:27:40,880 --> 00:27:43,493
if you can come often, I'll make
something new for you every time.

771
00:27:43,515 --> 00:27:45,470
My food's clean, affordable, and tasty.

772
00:27:45,920 --> 00:27:46,759
Don't worry. Eat up.

773
00:27:46,759 --> 00:27:47,440
- Nice.
- Shen.

774
00:27:47,460 --> 00:27:48,448
Are the pork chops ready?

775
00:27:48,448 --> 00:27:48,880
- Yes.
- I want one too.

776
00:27:48,880 --> 00:27:49,719
Me too.

777
00:27:49,860 --> 00:27:50,719
- Alright.
- Me too.

778
00:27:50,719 --> 00:27:51,319
There's enough.

779
00:27:51,319 --> 00:27:52,130
- Calm down.
- Dad.

780
00:27:52,440 --> 00:27:54,640
Pack me a bottle
of chili oil before I go back.

781
00:27:54,759 --> 00:27:56,479
Jianqi's dad and Meiqi love it.

782
00:27:56,479 --> 00:27:58,400
Don't worry. I packed it.

783
00:28:00,279 --> 00:28:02,039
I remember your things.

784
00:28:02,040 --> 00:28:03,440
Enjoy the food.
I have more guests coming soon.

785
00:28:03,440 --> 00:28:04,279
Love you.

786
00:28:06,420 --> 00:28:08,660
(Yangcheng Lake Mitten Crab)

787
00:28:23,519 --> 00:28:24,120
Nice.

788
00:28:26,360 --> 00:28:27,079
Mingzhu.

789
00:28:28,600 --> 00:28:30,640
What brings you here, Mom?

790
00:28:32,799 --> 00:28:34,079
This is the People's Hospital...

791
00:28:34,079 --> 00:28:34,840
Dr. Li.

792
00:28:35,200 --> 00:28:35,920
I know him.

793
00:28:36,360 --> 00:28:36,840
Hello.

794
00:28:37,039 --> 00:28:37,840
Hello, madam.

795
00:28:39,799 --> 00:28:41,920
Dr. Li came to book a birthday banquet
at our hotel,

796
00:28:42,239 --> 00:28:43,960
so I invited him to join us for lunch.

797
00:28:44,880 --> 00:28:45,719
Have a seat.

798
00:28:47,026 --> 00:28:48,270
In-law, what brings you here?

799
00:28:48,279 --> 00:28:49,999
Shen, look who's here.

800
00:28:50,680 --> 00:28:51,719
In-law.

801
00:28:51,719 --> 00:28:52,880
I specially came

802
00:28:52,880 --> 00:28:54,400
to bring you some crabs.

803
00:28:54,960 --> 00:28:57,279
The premium mitten crabs
from Yangcheng Lake.

804
00:28:57,680 --> 00:28:58,600
Ah, premium crabs.

805
00:28:58,840 --> 00:29:00,559
We don't know how to eat
such fancy stuff.

806
00:29:00,559 --> 00:29:02,200
Yeah. We don't know how to eat it.

807
00:29:02,200 --> 00:29:03,760
It's expensive. Take it back with you.

808
00:29:04,137 --> 00:29:05,030
You should learn.

809
00:29:05,759 --> 00:29:07,840
Learn how to eat. It's easy.

810
00:29:08,600 --> 00:29:09,239
Yes.

811
00:29:09,999 --> 00:29:11,279
You should learn

812
00:29:11,279 --> 00:29:12,640
to enjoy good things.

813
00:29:13,360 --> 00:29:13,999
Don't worry.

814
00:29:14,048 --> 00:29:15,750
When you finish these,
I'll bring you more.

815
00:29:15,759 --> 00:29:17,279
We have a lot.

816
00:29:17,880 --> 00:29:19,360
The tools to eat the crabs

817
00:29:19,360 --> 00:29:20,479
are in the box.

818
00:29:21,120 --> 00:29:21,600
Okay.

819
00:29:21,920 --> 00:29:23,400
Why don't you stay and eat with them?

820
00:29:23,400 --> 00:29:24,519
No, no.

821
00:29:24,519 --> 00:29:25,840
I'll go.

822
00:29:26,479 --> 00:29:27,239
Mingzhu,

823
00:29:27,799 --> 00:29:28,640
get home early.

824
00:29:28,719 --> 00:29:29,840
Be careful on the way.

825
00:29:29,840 --> 00:29:30,400
Alright.

826
00:29:30,640 --> 00:29:31,680
Please sit, Dr. Li.

827
00:29:31,680 --> 00:29:32,120
Alright.

828
00:29:32,120 --> 00:29:33,509
Alright. Enjoy the food.

829
00:29:33,510 --> 00:29:34,680
- I'll get going.
- Let me walk you out.

830
00:29:34,680 --> 00:29:35,719
- I'll walk you out.
- No need.

831
00:29:35,719 --> 00:29:36,920
- Take care.
- You're welcome.

832
00:29:37,400 --> 00:29:38,680
Enjoy the crabs.

833
00:29:38,680 --> 00:29:40,137
If it's not enough, I'll bring more.

834
00:29:40,160 --> 00:29:41,360
Be careful.

835
00:29:43,160 --> 00:29:43,840
Dr. Li,

836
00:29:44,559 --> 00:29:45,680
we have mitten crabs.

837
00:29:51,600 --> 00:29:52,360
Shen Shengli!

838
00:29:54,759 --> 00:29:55,719
Enjoy your lunch.

839
00:29:55,920 --> 00:29:57,479
Are the pork chops ready?

840
00:29:58,200 --> 00:29:59,559
Come on. Eat.

841
00:30:01,920 --> 00:30:02,960
Feng,

842
00:30:03,279 --> 00:30:05,479
don't you think this is strange?

843
00:30:06,893 --> 00:30:07,510
What's strange?

844
00:30:07,519 --> 00:30:08,559
Think about it.

845
00:30:09,319 --> 00:30:10,039
A man

846
00:30:10,479 --> 00:30:13,160
becoming an obstetrician

847
00:30:13,319 --> 00:30:15,079
is weird enough.

848
00:30:15,079 --> 00:30:16,279
That doesn't feel right.

849
00:30:16,799 --> 00:30:17,479
Also,

850
00:30:17,479 --> 00:30:19,799
why is Mingzhu getting so close to him?

851
00:30:20,920 --> 00:30:21,759
I think

852
00:30:22,559 --> 00:30:25,160
it's good for her
to have a doctor friend.

853
00:30:25,440 --> 00:30:26,840
No need to overthink it.

854
00:30:27,640 --> 00:30:29,840
My hunch. Trust my hunch.

855
00:30:30,440 --> 00:30:31,519
Let me analyze it for you.

856
00:30:32,160 --> 00:30:33,600
Mingzhu's pregnant.

857
00:30:34,200 --> 00:30:35,239
We tried to convince her

858
00:30:35,239 --> 00:30:36,479
not to work,

859
00:30:36,479 --> 00:30:37,799
but she insisted.

860
00:30:38,200 --> 00:30:39,079
Why?

861
00:30:39,600 --> 00:30:42,079
If I hadn't gone to her place
to drop off the crabs today,

862
00:30:42,079 --> 00:30:43,719
I would've never found out.

863
00:30:44,239 --> 00:30:45,559
What did you find out?

864
00:30:46,039 --> 00:30:47,680
They were just having lunch.

865
00:30:47,680 --> 00:30:49,360
No need to make a fuss.

866
00:30:49,804 --> 00:30:52,230
Do you remember
my sister talking about doing a DNA test

867
00:30:52,239 --> 00:30:54,999
at Jianqi's funeral?

868
00:30:56,279 --> 00:30:57,120
I don't remember.

869
00:30:57,880 --> 00:30:58,600
At that time,

870
00:30:58,600 --> 00:31:00,600
I thought she was being ridiculous.

871
00:31:00,600 --> 00:31:03,160
But now I think it's necessary.

872
00:31:03,880 --> 00:31:04,519
I mean it.

873
00:31:04,960 --> 00:31:05,999
What are you implying?

874
00:31:07,279 --> 00:31:08,759
We should get a test to find out

875
00:31:08,759 --> 00:31:10,719
if that baby is our grandson.

876
00:31:10,719 --> 00:31:11,360
He Lihua!

877
00:31:11,880 --> 00:31:13,069
Our son's gone,

878
00:31:13,070 --> 00:31:15,160
and you still want
to accuse his wife of cheating?

879
00:31:15,559 --> 00:31:16,920
What kind of mother are you?

880
00:31:17,759 --> 00:31:18,400
I just...

881
00:31:18,400 --> 00:31:19,039
Enough. Stop it.

882
00:31:19,799 --> 00:31:20,840
Mingzhu is a nice person.

883
00:31:21,239 --> 00:31:22,279
I trust her completely.

884
00:31:25,440 --> 00:31:27,319
Besides, she's single now.

885
00:31:27,880 --> 00:31:29,719
She has every right
to have male friends.

886
00:31:30,640 --> 00:31:31,600
That's reality.

887
00:31:31,920 --> 00:31:32,759
What can we do?

888
00:31:33,440 --> 00:31:34,319
I'm warning you.

889
00:31:34,719 --> 00:31:37,239
Never bring this up again.

890
00:31:39,680 --> 00:31:40,279
I...

891
00:31:40,360 --> 00:31:41,120
Never again.

892
00:31:50,999 --> 00:31:51,840
Has Dr. Li left?

893
00:31:51,937 --> 00:31:54,248
He was on the night shift last night.
He went home to rest.

894
00:31:55,440 --> 00:31:56,999
Being a doctor isn't easy.

895
00:31:57,440 --> 00:31:58,920
Life is never easy.

896
00:32:00,640 --> 00:32:01,799
Yours is the hardest.

897
00:32:02,120 --> 00:32:04,319
Have you seen Jianqi's mom's face
earlier today?

898
00:32:05,559 --> 00:32:07,920
You'll probably have a rough night.

899
00:32:07,920 --> 00:32:09,920
Why don't you just stay here tonight?

900
00:32:09,920 --> 00:32:10,719
Stay here?

901
00:32:10,719 --> 00:32:12,759
Then my mother-in-law
will get even more suspicious.

902
00:32:12,804 --> 00:32:13,640
As a daughter-in-law,

903
00:32:13,640 --> 00:32:15,871
I have to learn how to get along well
with the in-laws.

904
00:32:15,937 --> 00:32:16,920
Right? I have to face it.

905
00:32:17,160 --> 00:32:17,799
Yeah.

906
00:32:20,440 --> 00:32:20,999
Mingzhu.

907
00:32:22,479 --> 00:32:24,160
Dr. Li is a good man.

908
00:32:24,759 --> 00:32:25,479
He is.

909
00:32:26,519 --> 00:32:27,400
Is he married?

910
00:32:29,600 --> 00:32:31,239
Mom, what are you trying to say?

911
00:32:31,239 --> 00:32:32,200
Come on.

912
00:32:33,039 --> 00:32:34,840
You're single

913
00:32:34,840 --> 00:32:36,120
and young.

914
00:32:36,360 --> 00:32:38,559
You could think about it
if you meet someone nice.

915
00:32:38,604 --> 00:32:39,710
What I'm thinking about now

916
00:32:39,719 --> 00:32:41,079
is how to be a good mother.

917
00:32:59,160 --> 00:32:59,880
Slowly.

918
00:33:01,799 --> 00:33:02,440
Are you okay?

919
00:33:02,519 --> 00:33:02,999
I'm fine.

920
00:33:04,279 --> 00:33:05,479
Tie it tighter.

921
00:33:05,479 --> 00:33:06,880
Don't let it fall off.

922
00:33:07,840 --> 00:33:09,120
You're funny, you know that?

923
00:33:09,479 --> 00:33:11,200
Have faith in me.

924
00:33:11,759 --> 00:33:12,360
Dad,

925
00:33:13,537 --> 00:33:14,510
did you add the gravy?

926
00:33:14,680 --> 00:33:15,239
Yes.

927
00:33:15,920 --> 00:33:17,479
Braised gravy with rice.

928
00:33:17,479 --> 00:33:18,989
You could eat a whole bowl of it.

929
00:33:18,990 --> 00:33:20,004
Everyone in the school

930
00:33:20,048 --> 00:33:20,840
is getting fatter.

931
00:33:21,319 --> 00:33:21,999
That's good.

932
00:33:22,200 --> 00:33:23,999
You're all too skinny.

933
00:33:23,999 --> 00:33:25,440
Like a stick.

934
00:33:26,519 --> 00:33:28,279
That class rep girl.

935
00:33:28,519 --> 00:33:30,319
What's her name?

936
00:33:30,319 --> 00:33:31,200
She's Lu Bing, Mom.

937
00:33:31,479 --> 00:33:33,640
Her legs are thinner than my arms.

938
00:33:34,999 --> 00:33:35,519
Mom,

939
00:33:35,760 --> 00:33:37,404
she'll be the first one I fatten up.

940
00:33:38,719 --> 00:33:39,799
Stop joking around.

941
00:33:39,999 --> 00:33:41,279
Learn from her

942
00:33:41,279 --> 00:33:42,519
and get your grades up.

943
00:33:43,279 --> 00:33:44,640
Alright. I'm going.

944
00:33:45,519 --> 00:33:46,279
Thanks, Dad.

945
00:33:48,840 --> 00:33:49,440
Dad,

946
00:33:49,840 --> 00:33:50,799
look at me.

947
00:33:51,640 --> 00:33:54,160
I have to go to school, make deliveries,

948
00:33:54,271 --> 00:33:55,440
and negotiate business deals.

949
00:33:56,239 --> 00:33:57,920
Life's tough.

950
00:33:58,960 --> 00:34:00,239
Get going.

951
00:34:00,519 --> 00:34:01,239
I'm off.

952
00:34:01,248 --> 00:34:02,610
Hurry up. You're going to be late.

953
00:34:03,680 --> 00:34:05,360
- Ride safely.
- Remember to pay my wages.

954
00:34:05,840 --> 00:34:06,479
What's it?

955
00:34:06,479 --> 00:34:07,319
Wages.

956
00:34:07,880 --> 00:34:09,479
Who's paying me then?

957
00:34:11,920 --> 00:34:12,679
Feng,

958
00:34:12,999 --> 00:34:14,720
I thought about it all night.

959
00:34:15,360 --> 00:34:16,720
Shen Mingzhu is soft

960
00:34:16,800 --> 00:34:18,679
on the outside
and strong-willed on the inside.

961
00:34:18,880 --> 00:34:20,920
She's not easy to deal with.

962
00:34:22,519 --> 00:34:24,800
Once the baby is born,

963
00:34:25,519 --> 00:34:27,149
we should find a way to take the child.

964
00:34:27,150 --> 00:34:28,271
We'll raise it ourselves.

965
00:34:29,440 --> 00:34:30,679
Once the baby is born,

966
00:34:31,240 --> 00:34:33,119
our villa in Sanya

967
00:34:33,119 --> 00:34:34,320
will finally be useful.

968
00:34:35,960 --> 00:34:36,800
When Mingzhu

969
00:34:37,639 --> 00:34:38,999
goes to work,

970
00:34:39,679 --> 00:34:41,999
I'll take the baby

971
00:34:42,679 --> 00:34:44,440
and fly to Sanya.

972
00:34:45,720 --> 00:34:46,519
She's still young.

973
00:34:46,519 --> 00:34:48,280
She should focus on

974
00:34:48,280 --> 00:34:49,479
her career.

975
00:34:49,519 --> 00:34:51,320
You're dreaming again.

976
00:34:51,720 --> 00:34:53,320
Mingzhu won't agree to that.

977
00:34:54,360 --> 00:34:55,960
She won't have a choice.

978
00:34:56,320 --> 00:34:57,519
I'll tell her

979
00:34:57,760 --> 00:34:59,440
Sanya has sunshine,

980
00:34:59,519 --> 00:35:01,440
fresh air, and the sea.

981
00:35:01,440 --> 00:35:03,440
It's good for a child's growth.

982
00:35:04,960 --> 00:35:06,999
She's never been to our villa there.

983
00:35:07,519 --> 00:35:09,519
She won't be able to find us.

984
00:35:11,999 --> 00:35:13,119
What are you saying, Mom?

985
00:35:14,800 --> 00:35:15,400
Mingzhu,

986
00:35:15,604 --> 00:35:16,840
don't take it seriously.

987
00:35:16,999 --> 00:35:18,280
She's just talking nonsense.

988
00:35:18,479 --> 00:35:19,519
Come and have breakfast.

989
00:35:22,079 --> 00:35:24,280
Dad, you're the sensible one.

990
00:35:24,440 --> 00:35:26,199
Tell her who has the custody rights?

991
00:35:26,199 --> 00:35:27,159
The parents,

992
00:35:27,159 --> 00:35:28,119
or the grandparents?

993
00:35:28,119 --> 00:35:30,159
Grandparents are important too.

994
00:35:30,159 --> 00:35:30,920
No, it's not that.

995
00:35:30,920 --> 00:35:31,519
Mingzhu,

996
00:35:31,760 --> 00:35:32,800
don't get upset.

997
00:35:32,920 --> 00:35:34,400
Dad and Mom didn't mean it like that.

998
00:35:34,519 --> 00:35:37,479
They just want to help.

999
00:35:38,159 --> 00:35:39,360
When the baby's born,

1000
00:35:39,479 --> 00:35:40,320
you can go to work

1001
00:35:40,320 --> 00:35:41,639
or get married as you want, right?

1002
00:35:41,639 --> 00:35:42,320
Besides,

1003
00:35:42,639 --> 00:35:43,800
I'm here.

1004
00:35:43,800 --> 00:35:44,515
Raising a child...

1005
00:35:44,537 --> 00:35:45,920
Did I ever say I need any help?

1006
00:35:45,920 --> 00:35:47,280
Do I need your help?

1007
00:35:47,448 --> 00:35:49,071
And you, how would you raise a child?

1008
00:35:49,093 --> 00:35:50,937
You can't even take care of yourself.

1009
00:35:51,693 --> 00:35:52,880
The baby's not even born yet,

1010
00:35:52,880 --> 00:35:54,510
and you're already
fighting over custody.

1011
00:35:54,510 --> 00:35:55,439
You've gone too far.

1012
00:35:55,440 --> 00:35:56,720
We're not fighting for custody...

1013
00:35:56,720 --> 00:35:57,519
Feng Jianqi!

1014
00:35:58,119 --> 00:35:59,519
Should I endure this anymore?

1015
00:36:29,782 --> 00:36:30,960
Come on. Let's grab lunch.

1016
00:36:31,248 --> 00:36:32,604
I'll go later. You go ahead.

1017
00:36:36,039 --> 00:36:36,880
I've given it to them.

1018
00:36:44,479 --> 00:36:46,159
Hao, are you going for lunch?

1019
00:36:46,159 --> 00:36:47,159
Go ahead. I'm not hungry.

1020
00:36:47,440 --> 00:36:48,360
Alright. See you.

1021
00:36:48,360 --> 00:36:48,840
Sure.

1022
00:37:14,248 --> 00:37:15,070
Have you had lunch?

1023
00:37:15,320 --> 00:37:15,800
I had.

1024
00:37:40,800 --> 00:37:41,360
Who's that?

1025
00:37:41,360 --> 00:37:42,079
Sorry.

1026
00:37:42,079 --> 00:37:42,720
Uh...

1027
00:37:43,079 --> 00:37:44,079
It's me, Zhang Hao.

1028
00:37:44,720 --> 00:37:46,360
Can we talk in the afternoon?

1029
00:37:46,626 --> 00:37:49,248
I was up till two last night
going through the documents.

1030
00:37:49,519 --> 00:37:51,999
Sorry for disturbing your nap.

1031
00:37:52,479 --> 00:37:53,320
Please get some rest.

1032
00:37:54,226 --> 00:37:55,470
Don't you want a blanket?

1033
00:38:04,871 --> 00:38:06,110
No need to line up anymore.

1034
00:38:06,293 --> 00:38:07,693
The pork chops are sold out.

1035
00:38:08,360 --> 00:38:09,760
They sold out fast.

1036
00:38:10,159 --> 00:38:11,440
Lots of students didn't get any.

1037
00:38:11,679 --> 00:38:12,514
That's not right.

1038
00:38:12,515 --> 00:38:14,382
They should use a queue system
or something.

1039
00:38:16,400 --> 00:38:17,159
I think

1040
00:38:17,679 --> 00:38:19,400
first-come, first-served is the fairest.

1041
00:38:22,920 --> 00:38:24,639
Mr. Sun, it's for you.

1042
00:38:27,679 --> 00:38:28,440
Mr. Hu,

1043
00:38:28,960 --> 00:38:29,800
I'm sorry.

1044
00:38:29,915 --> 00:38:31,750
But you're representing the school
in business

1045
00:38:31,760 --> 00:38:32,715
with my family now.

1046
00:38:32,999 --> 00:38:34,280
If I treat you,

1047
00:38:34,639 --> 00:38:35,679
that's bribery.

1048
00:38:38,119 --> 00:38:40,440
I should at least try the food

1049
00:38:40,440 --> 00:38:41,280
for quality control.

1050
00:38:41,599 --> 00:38:43,159
That's necessary.

1051
00:38:44,826 --> 00:38:47,182
If I eat Mr. Sun's pork chop,
that's not bribery, is it?

1052
00:38:47,679 --> 00:38:48,880
Mr. Sun has three highs.

1053
00:38:48,880 --> 00:38:49,840
I'll taste it for him.

1054
00:38:54,280 --> 00:38:54,880
Delicious.

1055
00:38:55,039 --> 00:38:55,639
Delicious?

1056
00:38:56,679 --> 00:38:57,440
It's all yours.

1057
00:38:59,400 --> 00:38:59,960
Lu Bing!

1058
00:39:02,159 --> 00:39:03,679
There's a seat here. Come sit.

1059
00:39:11,079 --> 00:39:11,880
Hello, Mr. Sun.

1060
00:39:12,119 --> 00:39:12,920
There's grease there.

1061
00:39:13,280 --> 00:39:13,720
Sit here.

1062
00:39:25,119 --> 00:39:26,280
Why are you eating so late?

1063
00:39:26,559 --> 00:39:28,079
I just finished my math homework.

1064
00:39:55,119 --> 00:39:55,920
The doctor said

1065
00:39:56,840 --> 00:39:59,159
I need to drink this.
It's good for my health.

1066
00:39:59,639 --> 00:40:00,559
Thank you.

1067
00:40:04,537 --> 00:40:06,070
Any questions you couldn't solve?

1068
00:40:06,800 --> 00:40:07,840
The last one.

1069
00:40:09,599 --> 00:40:10,840
Mr. Sun is here.

1070
00:40:10,840 --> 00:40:12,440
You can ask him directly.

1071
00:40:12,920 --> 00:40:13,599
Mr. Hu,

1072
00:40:14,280 --> 00:40:15,679
when you have lunch with Meiqi,

1073
00:40:16,039 --> 00:40:17,360
do you also teach her physics?

1074
00:40:17,360 --> 00:40:18,471
You talk about Newton's laws

1075
00:40:18,493 --> 00:40:19,693
or Ohm's law?

1076
00:40:20,840 --> 00:40:21,559
Shen Minghui.

1077
00:40:22,679 --> 00:40:23,880
Finish up

1078
00:40:23,880 --> 00:40:24,960
what's left

1079
00:40:25,280 --> 00:40:26,400
and get back to your class.

1080
00:40:26,510 --> 00:40:27,782
I haven't finished eating yet.

1081
00:40:32,079 --> 00:40:34,280
Why does that boy hate me so much?

1082
00:40:36,840 --> 00:40:38,039
Who's Feng Meiqi?

1083
00:40:39,039 --> 00:40:39,880
Didn't I tell you?

1084
00:40:39,880 --> 00:40:40,800
My girlfriend.

1085
00:40:42,679 --> 00:40:43,559
Wait.

1086
00:40:44,159 --> 00:40:44,999
His surname is Shen,

1087
00:40:45,280 --> 00:40:46,679
but his sister's surname is Feng?

1088
00:40:47,840 --> 00:40:51,999
Feng Meiqi is Shen Minghui's
brother-in-law's sister.

1089
00:40:52,159 --> 00:40:55,079
His brother-in-law's name
is Feng Jianqi.

1090
00:40:56,679 --> 00:40:57,119
Got it?

1091
00:41:19,960 --> 00:41:21,320
If you don't understand anything,

1092
00:41:21,320 --> 00:41:22,280
come to my office.

1093
00:41:22,880 --> 00:41:23,999
Okay. Thank you, Mr. Sun.

1094
00:41:24,880 --> 00:41:25,679
Hurry up and eat.

1095
00:41:43,280 --> 00:41:44,559
Hello, Meiqi?

1096
00:41:48,320 --> 00:41:49,280
I'm eating now.

1097
00:41:49,280 --> 00:41:50,159
At the school canteen.

1098
00:41:51,159 --> 00:41:51,960
Have you eaten?

1099
00:41:52,737 --> 00:41:55,115
Alright. I only have
two classes this afternoon.

1100
00:42:02,679 --> 00:42:05,599
Try this. Shen's smoked fish.

1101
00:42:06,115 --> 00:42:07,426
Be careful. There are bones.

1102
00:42:08,360 --> 00:42:09,479
The teachers were here.

1103
00:42:09,493 --> 00:42:10,982
I didn't want to offer them any.

1104
00:42:13,280 --> 00:42:13,999
Nice?

1105
00:42:16,280 --> 00:42:17,159
It's delicious.

1106
00:42:17,800 --> 00:42:18,559
I'm about to start

1107
00:42:18,559 --> 00:42:19,679
my second business plan.

1108
00:42:20,599 --> 00:42:21,999
I'm bringing Shen's smoked fish

1109
00:42:21,999 --> 00:42:23,039
into the canteen.

1110
00:42:23,800 --> 00:42:25,079
But the smoked fish has bones.

1111
00:42:25,159 --> 00:42:26,479
Too bad if someone chokes on it.

1112
00:42:27,159 --> 00:42:29,280
That's a problem we need to fix.

1113
00:42:31,280 --> 00:42:32,400
You can use

1114
00:42:33,479 --> 00:42:35,320
boneless fish.

1115
00:42:35,320 --> 00:42:36,320
Boneless fish?

1116
00:42:37,960 --> 00:42:40,039
Boneless fish...

1117
00:42:41,280 --> 00:42:41,999
Wooden fish?

1118
00:42:55,100 --> 00:42:56,950
