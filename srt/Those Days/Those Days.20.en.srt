00:01:10,752 --> 00:01:12,431
=Those Days=

2
00:01:12,431 --> 00:01:14,800
(Adapted from iceread.com novel
"You Xi" by Qingyang Wanxi)

3
00:01:14,980 --> 00:01:17,980
=Episode 20=

4
00:01:22,580 --> 00:01:23,500
It is all put together.

5
00:01:24,660 --> 00:01:25,860
Mom, do you know that master?

6
00:01:25,860 --> 00:01:26,860
Can he fix it?

7
00:01:27,260 --> 00:01:28,220
I just...

8
00:01:29,020 --> 00:01:30,540
I am not sure.

9
00:01:30,540 --> 00:01:33,260
I will take it tomorrow and ask him.

10
00:01:35,460 --> 00:01:38,820
That programme
on the TV station, that one...

11
00:01:39,520 --> 00:01:40,980
Does it not feature gold inlaid jade?

12
00:01:41,260 --> 00:01:43,180
We could add a bit of gold to secure it.

13
00:01:43,900 --> 00:01:45,220
It might even look better.

14
00:01:46,020 --> 00:01:46,580
Dad.

15
00:01:47,380 --> 00:01:49,700
This is Mingzhu's
in-laws' ancestral treasure.

16
00:01:50,020 --> 00:01:52,500
If you add gold to it
and let Mingzhu take it back,

17
00:01:52,500 --> 00:01:54,700
her in-laws will not be happy.

18
00:01:55,060 --> 00:01:56,740
It must look exactly the same.

19
00:01:56,740 --> 00:01:58,300
Only then can Mingzhu explain herself.

20
00:01:59,980 --> 00:02:01,020
Exactly the same.

21
00:02:02,580 --> 00:02:06,020
I think that will be quite difficult.

22
00:02:06,540 --> 00:02:09,540
For Mingzhu, we must do it
no matter how hard it is.

23
00:02:11,580 --> 00:02:12,180
Do it.

24
00:02:13,700 --> 00:02:14,180
This.

25
00:02:15,540 --> 00:02:16,300
Master Jin.

26
00:02:17,180 --> 00:02:18,180
Please have a look.

27
00:02:18,740 --> 00:02:19,740
Can it be repaired?

28
00:02:20,620 --> 00:02:21,860
Let me take a look first.

29
00:02:23,260 --> 00:02:25,140
It needs to fit perfectly.

30
00:02:25,420 --> 00:02:26,980
I must see it before I say anything.

31
00:02:26,980 --> 00:02:27,940
All right.

32
00:02:34,060 --> 00:02:34,700
Mom.

33
00:02:36,140 --> 00:02:36,740
Mom.

34
00:02:37,540 --> 00:02:38,420
I am here.

35
00:02:39,180 --> 00:02:40,620
All right.

36
00:02:42,300 --> 00:02:42,860
I am coming.

37
00:02:43,620 --> 00:02:44,300
Is it done?

38
00:02:46,300 --> 00:02:47,940
I mean, is it repaired?

39
00:02:49,460 --> 00:02:50,500
It is repaired.

40
00:02:50,500 --> 00:02:52,620
I went over early this morning.

41
00:02:53,300 --> 00:02:54,940
I was worried that her mother-in-law

42
00:02:54,940 --> 00:02:57,300
would see your sister's wrist empty

43
00:02:57,300 --> 00:02:58,500
and become suspicious.

44
00:02:58,500 --> 00:03:00,540
Slow down. Do not grab it.

45
00:03:00,740 --> 00:03:02,940
Slow down.

46
00:03:03,780 --> 00:03:05,420
You really are a mother-in-law.

47
00:03:05,420 --> 00:03:06,260
Very experienced.

48
00:03:10,940 --> 00:03:12,820
The master repaired it beautifully.

49
00:03:13,740 --> 00:03:15,780
Of course. He is an old master.

50
00:03:16,740 --> 00:03:17,780
After it was repaired,

51
00:03:17,940 --> 00:03:20,980
I checked it under the light
to looked for the crack.

52
00:03:20,980 --> 00:03:22,420
I could not find it at all.

53
00:03:22,820 --> 00:03:23,300
You know,

54
00:03:23,300 --> 00:03:25,060
you really cannot see anything.

55
00:03:25,060 --> 00:03:26,620
It is repaired so perfectly, Mom.

56
00:03:26,620 --> 00:03:27,660
Yes, slow down.

57
00:03:27,660 --> 00:03:29,060
I need to take this to Mingzhu at once.

58
00:03:29,060 --> 00:03:30,220
Let me wrap it for you.

59
00:03:30,220 --> 00:03:32,220
Slow down, take your time.

60
00:03:32,220 --> 00:03:33,900
I am not going to break it.

61
00:03:33,900 --> 00:03:35,700
Just be a little careful.

62
00:03:35,760 --> 00:03:36,340
Keep it safe.

63
00:03:36,360 --> 00:03:37,750
- Come, let me help.
- It is safe.

64
00:03:38,020 --> 00:03:38,940
Do not rush.

65
00:03:38,940 --> 00:03:40,050
- It is safe.
- I am heading out.

66
00:03:40,060 --> 00:03:40,860
Wait.

67
00:03:41,220 --> 00:03:41,820
What is it?

68
00:03:42,660 --> 00:03:44,340
Are you asking me for the repair fee?

69
00:03:44,340 --> 00:03:46,220
Mingzhu is your own daughter,

70
00:03:46,220 --> 00:03:47,340
spending a little is nothing.

71
00:03:47,340 --> 00:03:48,700
That is not it.

72
00:03:51,980 --> 00:03:52,580
What?

73
00:03:56,960 --> 00:03:57,980
(IOU. I, Xu Zhidong, owe Xu Zhixia 100,000 yuan)

74
00:03:57,990 --> 00:03:58,740
(Debtor: Xu Zhidong)

75
00:04:00,780 --> 00:04:02,460
Your dad and I made him write it.

76
00:04:02,620 --> 00:04:03,820
But the interest

77
00:04:04,300 --> 00:04:05,860
he added that himself.

78
00:04:05,860 --> 00:04:06,780
No one asked him to.

79
00:04:06,780 --> 00:04:07,740
Look at your brother.

80
00:04:08,660 --> 00:04:10,380
He really is becoming more thoughtful.

81
00:04:11,620 --> 00:04:12,980
He is starting to act like a man.

82
00:04:13,140 --> 00:04:13,740
Yes.

83
00:04:14,460 --> 00:04:15,260
Zhixia.

84
00:04:15,260 --> 00:04:16,300
Let me tell you.

85
00:04:16,300 --> 00:04:17,980
Your dad and I

86
00:04:19,380 --> 00:04:20,460
reflected on ourselves.

87
00:04:21,980 --> 00:04:23,500
Both our children matter to us.

88
00:04:23,500 --> 00:04:26,140
We should treat you equally.

89
00:04:26,420 --> 00:04:28,380
That is what parents should do.

90
00:04:28,980 --> 00:04:30,420
We should not rely on seniority

91
00:04:30,430 --> 00:04:32,560
and we should not take from one
to give to the other.

92
00:04:32,860 --> 00:04:33,540
Look.

93
00:04:33,860 --> 00:04:35,020
Look at you now.

94
00:04:35,180 --> 00:04:36,660
You have your own family.

95
00:04:36,660 --> 00:04:38,900
You and Zhang Hao
are building your own life.

96
00:04:39,060 --> 00:04:41,740
Jiao also needs to be raised
and now you have a second baby coming.

97
00:04:41,740 --> 00:04:42,420
We just...

98
00:04:42,580 --> 00:04:44,460
Right, you can
give birth naturally, yes?

99
00:04:44,560 --> 00:04:45,900
You are of advanced maternal age.

100
00:04:46,740 --> 00:04:48,100
I know I am of advanced age.

101
00:04:48,700 --> 00:04:49,300
I know.

102
00:04:49,620 --> 00:04:50,500
All right. Keep...

103
00:04:50,500 --> 00:04:52,500
Keep that IOU safe.

104
00:04:52,700 --> 00:04:54,340
When is Xu Zhidong planning to repay me?

105
00:04:55,580 --> 00:04:56,100
Repay...

106
00:04:58,580 --> 00:05:00,660
All right, I know. Keep it for me.

107
00:05:00,660 --> 00:05:01,220
I am leaving.

108
00:05:20,460 --> 00:05:21,060
Mingzhu.

109
00:05:21,300 --> 00:05:22,820
The bangle is repaired perfectly.

110
00:05:22,820 --> 00:05:24,020
I will bring it to you now.

111
00:05:24,980 --> 00:05:26,180
Thank you, Zhixia.

112
00:05:26,660 --> 00:05:28,700
I am having dinner at my in-laws' today.

113
00:05:28,940 --> 00:05:30,300
I was just worrying about it.

114
00:05:34,260 --> 00:05:35,300
Give me a moment.

115
00:05:41,500 --> 00:05:42,140
Mingzhu.

116
00:05:42,860 --> 00:05:43,460
Mom.

117
00:05:44,380 --> 00:05:45,340
Why are you here?

118
00:05:45,620 --> 00:05:46,940
I just finished my spa treatment.

119
00:05:46,940 --> 00:05:48,580
I saw it was nearly
the end of your shift,

120
00:05:48,580 --> 00:05:50,540
so I asked the driver
to swing by and pick you up.

121
00:05:50,540 --> 00:05:51,500
We can go home together.

122
00:05:51,660 --> 00:05:54,420
No, I have not finished my work yet.

123
00:05:54,620 --> 00:05:55,820
Please go back and rest first.

124
00:05:55,960 --> 00:05:57,820
I can walk home later.
It is very convenient.

125
00:05:57,820 --> 00:05:58,980
Walk home for what?

126
00:05:58,980 --> 00:06:00,620
I am already here. I will wait for you.

127
00:06:01,460 --> 00:06:02,860
This is my way of showing care.

128
00:06:02,860 --> 00:06:03,540
Understand?

129
00:06:04,560 --> 00:06:05,340
Then how about this.

130
00:06:05,340 --> 00:06:06,980
I will book you a private room
on the second floor.

131
00:06:06,980 --> 00:06:07,980
You can rest there first.

132
00:06:07,980 --> 00:06:08,620
I am not going.

133
00:06:09,180 --> 00:06:10,100
I will sit right here.

134
00:06:10,820 --> 00:06:11,740
My husband, Feng,

135
00:06:11,740 --> 00:06:13,820
is an important client of Nanxi Hotel.

136
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:15,740
I would like to see
who dares say no to me.

137
00:06:16,380 --> 00:06:17,180
I will wait for you.

138
00:06:18,100 --> 00:06:19,060
Pour me a cup of tea.

139
00:06:19,300 --> 00:06:19,860
Yes, madam.

140
00:06:26,020 --> 00:06:26,900
(It is over.)

141
00:06:32,740 --> 00:06:34,540
It is over. My mother-in-law is here.

142
00:06:43,980 --> 00:06:45,980
Miss Zhang, you are looking at jade.

143
00:06:47,320 --> 00:06:48,940
Do not look aimlessly
and buy recklessly.

144
00:06:48,940 --> 00:06:49,980
Let me tell you.

145
00:06:50,540 --> 00:06:52,220
There are so many fakes nowadays.

146
00:06:52,380 --> 00:06:53,980
If you buy, you must buy something good.

147
00:06:54,300 --> 00:06:56,380
Let me show you the one from my family.

148
00:06:56,980 --> 00:06:57,620
Mingzhu.

149
00:06:58,260 --> 00:06:58,860
Come here.

150
00:06:58,860 --> 00:07:00,620
Show Aunt Zhang your bangle.

151
00:07:02,420 --> 00:07:02,980
Come on.

152
00:07:03,040 --> 00:07:05,060
- Wait a moment.
- Where is this water coming from?

153
00:07:06,020 --> 00:07:06,900
Lobby manager!

154
00:07:07,700 --> 00:07:08,500
Lobby manager!

155
00:07:08,500 --> 00:07:09,420
Let me tell you.

156
00:07:09,420 --> 00:07:11,500
Nanxi Hotel
is not doing well these days.

157
00:07:11,500 --> 00:07:13,420
Guests are shouting everywhere.

158
00:07:13,420 --> 00:07:15,020
There is no manners at all.

159
00:07:15,020 --> 00:07:17,180
Why is there water all over the floor?

160
00:07:17,180 --> 00:07:18,860
I am a pregnant woman.

161
00:07:18,860 --> 00:07:20,340
If I slip and something happens,

162
00:07:20,340 --> 00:07:21,620
you will have to compensate.

163
00:07:21,620 --> 00:07:22,860
Thank your mom for me.

164
00:07:22,860 --> 00:07:24,500
Sorry. Please calm down.

165
00:07:24,660 --> 00:07:25,860
- Calm down.
- I am furious.

166
00:07:25,860 --> 00:07:26,500
All right.

167
00:07:26,500 --> 00:07:28,740
My daughter in law works here.

168
00:07:28,740 --> 00:07:30,940
We told her to change jobs,
but she would not listen.

169
00:07:31,740 --> 00:07:34,140
There is no choice.
She is a girl from a modest family.

170
00:07:34,340 --> 00:07:35,340
She cannot be persuaded.

171
00:07:37,060 --> 00:07:37,740
Come.

172
00:07:39,260 --> 00:07:40,340
Let me show you.

173
00:07:41,380 --> 00:07:41,980
Come.

174
00:07:42,500 --> 00:07:43,260
Have a look.

175
00:07:43,500 --> 00:07:44,420
See this?

176
00:07:44,740 --> 00:07:46,140
This is proper jade.

177
00:07:46,140 --> 00:07:47,860
High transparency. It even glows.

178
00:07:48,560 --> 00:07:49,860
- It has grown a lot.
- Mingzhu.

179
00:07:49,860 --> 00:07:50,860
Come. Dinner is ready.

180
00:07:51,420 --> 00:07:52,060
Coming.

181
00:07:53,380 --> 00:07:54,740
Come. Eat. Mingzhu is here.

182
00:07:55,260 --> 00:07:56,420
Come, Mingzhu.

183
00:07:56,860 --> 00:07:57,940
- Dad is back.
- Come.

184
00:07:58,260 --> 00:07:59,140
Let me tell you.

185
00:07:59,140 --> 00:08:02,380
Dad brought goose wings
back from Guangzhou.

186
00:08:03,360 --> 00:08:05,820
- These goose wings are famous.
- They taste amazing. Try one.

187
00:08:05,820 --> 00:08:06,940
Everyone gets one.

188
00:08:06,940 --> 00:08:07,940
- Yours.
- Thank you, Mom.

189
00:08:08,360 --> 00:08:09,700
I do not want it. Do not serve me.

190
00:08:09,700 --> 00:08:10,740
I can use my own hands.

191
00:08:10,740 --> 00:08:12,420
You child.

192
00:08:12,420 --> 00:08:14,460
Mom is happy to serve you a little.

193
00:08:14,460 --> 00:08:16,420
You really do not know
how lucky you are.

194
00:08:16,580 --> 00:08:17,260
I know.

195
00:08:20,100 --> 00:08:21,780
Let me share some good news.

196
00:08:22,620 --> 00:08:25,420
At the order fair
in Guangzhou this time,

197
00:08:25,700 --> 00:08:26,940
I secured several big contracts.

198
00:08:28,040 --> 00:08:29,880
We may be busy
in the second half of the year.

199
00:08:30,100 --> 00:08:30,980
So matters at home,

200
00:08:31,340 --> 00:08:32,350
I will rely on all of you.

201
00:08:33,060 --> 00:08:33,860
Feng.

202
00:08:34,100 --> 00:08:35,220
In my view,

203
00:08:35,660 --> 00:08:37,900
we should bring in a managing director

204
00:08:38,100 --> 00:08:39,380
and let him run the company.

205
00:08:39,820 --> 00:08:41,220
You are not young any more,

206
00:08:41,220 --> 00:08:41,820
right?

207
00:08:42,100 --> 00:08:44,260
You should come home
and enjoy tending your flowers,

208
00:08:44,580 --> 00:08:46,580
spend time
with the grandchild and enjoy life.

209
00:08:47,260 --> 00:08:49,460
Raising a grandchild costs money.

210
00:08:50,580 --> 00:08:51,460
How about this, Feng?

211
00:08:52,060 --> 00:08:52,940
You retire,

212
00:08:52,940 --> 00:08:54,540
and I take over the family business.

213
00:08:54,540 --> 00:08:55,220
You?

214
00:08:55,740 --> 00:08:57,540
You should start from the front line.

215
00:08:57,580 --> 00:08:59,740
Gain enough experience
before coming back to help Dad.

216
00:08:59,740 --> 00:09:01,320
- Mom is right.
- Who are you looking down on?

217
00:09:02,840 --> 00:09:03,660
By the way, Mingzhu.

218
00:09:04,340 --> 00:09:05,900
How many weeks is the baby now?

219
00:09:06,860 --> 00:09:08,180
Almost fourteen weeks.

220
00:09:08,740 --> 00:09:10,580
You are very precise, Feng.

221
00:09:10,980 --> 00:09:13,260
Most men just ask
how many months she is pregnant.

222
00:09:13,260 --> 00:09:14,580
That is Feng.

223
00:09:14,580 --> 00:09:15,700
Who else would it be?

224
00:09:16,900 --> 00:09:17,740
Your dad

225
00:09:17,740 --> 00:09:20,180
takes everything very seriously.

226
00:09:20,500 --> 00:09:22,300
Back when we were
in the textile factory,

227
00:09:22,300 --> 00:09:25,340
he worked his way up
from the workshop to the general office.

228
00:09:25,560 --> 00:09:27,920
He could always pick things up
and put them down with ease.

229
00:09:28,460 --> 00:09:30,380
That is why when we started
the company later,

230
00:09:30,380 --> 00:09:31,860
everything fell into place.

231
00:09:32,620 --> 00:09:34,140
Back then Jianqi always said

232
00:09:34,140 --> 00:09:35,300
Dad is amazing.

233
00:09:35,300 --> 00:09:36,500
Whatever he does, he succeeds.

234
00:09:36,500 --> 00:09:37,340
No.

235
00:09:38,020 --> 00:09:38,820
Just a moment.

236
00:09:39,900 --> 00:09:41,660
Miss Mao, is the soup ready?

237
00:09:41,860 --> 00:09:42,540
Yes.

238
00:09:42,540 --> 00:09:43,580
Great, bring it over.

239
00:09:47,460 --> 00:09:48,060
This is tasty.

240
00:09:48,060 --> 00:09:48,540
Isn't it?

241
00:09:48,540 --> 00:09:49,140
Yes, it is.

242
00:09:49,540 --> 00:09:50,100
Mingzhu.

243
00:09:50,360 --> 00:09:51,900
I heard we ran out of fish maw at home.

244
00:09:52,060 --> 00:09:52,900
I bought some.

245
00:09:52,900 --> 00:09:54,520
Not sure if it is suitable. Have a look.

246
00:09:54,900 --> 00:09:55,740
Thank you, Dad.

247
00:09:55,900 --> 00:09:56,660
Mingzhu,

248
00:09:56,820 --> 00:09:58,500
this fish maw is very good for you.

249
00:09:59,180 --> 00:10:00,220
You should keep eating it.

250
00:10:00,660 --> 00:10:01,900
I bought a few feeding bottles.

251
00:10:01,900 --> 00:10:02,780
See which one works best.

252
00:10:02,780 --> 00:10:03,900
You even bought feeding bottles?

253
00:10:03,900 --> 00:10:04,340
I bought several.

254
00:10:04,340 --> 00:10:05,900
Feng, you really came prepared.

255
00:10:05,900 --> 00:10:07,660
You are going to be a grandpa after all.

256
00:10:07,660 --> 00:10:08,660
Such attention to detail.

257
00:10:08,900 --> 00:10:10,300
You even bought bottles.

258
00:10:10,300 --> 00:10:10,820
Different stages.

259
00:10:10,820 --> 00:10:11,420
Mingzhu.

260
00:10:11,780 --> 00:10:13,220
I know this feeding bottle.

261
00:10:13,620 --> 00:10:15,300
Let me tell you, it is a new product.

262
00:10:15,500 --> 00:10:17,020
It withstands heat and drops.

263
00:10:17,070 --> 00:10:18,020
- Is that so?
- I am not too sure myself.

264
00:10:18,020 --> 00:10:19,300
This is great.

265
00:10:20,220 --> 00:10:22,420
Feng, you are making me jealous.

266
00:10:24,660 --> 00:10:26,980
I could never forget you, my lady.

267
00:10:27,460 --> 00:10:28,580
Tiffany.

268
00:10:29,100 --> 00:10:30,980
- Thank you, Feng.
- Look how thrilled she is.

269
00:10:35,380 --> 00:10:36,780
This is wonderful, look.

270
00:10:36,780 --> 00:10:39,300
Mingzhu has her ancestral bangle,

271
00:10:39,820 --> 00:10:41,980
and Meiqi now has her new bracelet.

272
00:10:42,220 --> 00:10:44,100
This is what you call
the best of both worlds.

273
00:10:44,980 --> 00:10:47,020
And you are not forgotten, Madam Feng.

274
00:10:47,020 --> 00:10:49,620
Here, this is a pearl bracelet.

275
00:10:50,250 --> 00:10:51,860
- Thank you.
- This suits you perfectly.

276
00:10:52,100 --> 00:10:53,700
Mom, open it and show us.

277
00:10:53,700 --> 00:10:54,380
Let us see.

278
00:10:54,380 --> 00:10:55,100
Look at mine.

279
00:10:55,820 --> 00:10:57,140
- Looks lovely.
- It really does.

280
00:10:59,180 --> 00:11:01,820
Our family has been through
quite a lot this year.

281
00:11:02,380 --> 00:11:03,180
It has been tough.

282
00:11:04,740 --> 00:11:06,140
We owe you a great deal, Madam Feng.

283
00:11:06,740 --> 00:11:07,420
Thank you.

284
00:11:07,980 --> 00:11:09,580
Look at what you are saying.

285
00:11:11,500 --> 00:11:13,180
Isn't that what I should do?

286
00:11:14,900 --> 00:11:15,740
Thank you.

287
00:11:17,820 --> 00:11:18,620
All right.

288
00:11:19,140 --> 00:11:20,660
Today is a happy day.

289
00:11:20,660 --> 00:11:21,020
Yes.

290
00:11:21,020 --> 00:11:21,980
Let us

291
00:11:22,140 --> 00:11:23,260
eat.

292
00:11:23,260 --> 00:11:24,420
Let us take a photo.

293
00:11:24,420 --> 00:11:25,380
All right.

294
00:11:25,380 --> 00:11:25,740
Come.

295
00:11:26,500 --> 00:11:26,980
Come on.

296
00:11:26,980 --> 00:11:27,700
Look at me.

297
00:11:27,700 --> 00:11:28,500
Come on.

298
00:11:28,820 --> 00:11:30,380
Three, two, one.

299
00:11:41,740 --> 00:11:43,100
Zhilu.

300
00:11:45,940 --> 00:11:47,500
Zhilu.

301
00:11:54,020 --> 00:11:54,950
What are you looking at?

302
00:12:01,460 --> 00:12:03,180
I told you this family is odd.

303
00:12:10,420 --> 00:12:11,340
They show off nonstop.

304
00:12:11,340 --> 00:12:13,740
They even managed
to fix Mingzhu's bangle.

305
00:12:13,740 --> 00:12:14,900
Repaired so perfectly.

306
00:12:16,300 --> 00:12:18,300
A museum should hire them
to restore artifacts.

307
00:12:18,300 --> 00:12:19,260
What a waste otherwise.

308
00:12:19,660 --> 00:12:20,740
Such a waste.

309
00:12:21,100 --> 00:12:22,020
Enough.

310
00:12:22,500 --> 00:12:24,260
They are helping Mingzhu, aren't they?

311
00:12:24,580 --> 00:12:26,580
What good are those bitter
remarks of yours?

312
00:12:26,580 --> 00:12:27,700
Yes, they have the ability.

313
00:12:27,700 --> 00:12:28,580
They can help Mingzhu.

314
00:12:28,580 --> 00:12:29,540
I cannot help with anything.

315
00:12:29,540 --> 00:12:30,260
I am nothing.

316
00:12:30,260 --> 00:12:32,020
All I did was give you
a defective child.

317
00:12:32,020 --> 00:12:32,620
Enough?

318
00:12:35,940 --> 00:12:36,420
What then?

319
00:12:36,420 --> 00:12:38,760
That defective child
has nothing to do with me, is that it?

320
00:12:38,900 --> 00:12:39,980
Yes, nothing to do with you.

321
00:12:41,500 --> 00:12:41,980
I…

322
00:12:42,780 --> 00:12:43,700
Are you daft?

323
00:12:45,100 --> 00:12:45,780
Xiang.

324
00:12:47,460 --> 00:12:48,260
Where are you?

325
00:12:48,580 --> 00:12:49,460
Upstairs.

326
00:12:52,980 --> 00:12:53,980
Why are you calling me?

327
00:12:56,740 --> 00:12:57,380
Lovely.

328
00:12:59,620 --> 00:13:00,500
These things,

329
00:13:00,500 --> 00:13:02,860
aren't they supposed
to be provided by the bride's family?

330
00:13:03,220 --> 00:13:06,060
We as the groom's side
also need things for the bed, right?

331
00:13:06,460 --> 00:13:07,340
And

332
00:13:07,980 --> 00:13:10,540
it is different now.
Men and women are the same.

333
00:13:10,820 --> 00:13:11,820
The same my foot.

334
00:13:12,380 --> 00:13:13,140
The same? So why

335
00:13:13,140 --> 00:13:15,060
do we men still have to
pay the betrothal money?

336
00:13:15,060 --> 00:13:15,500
You…

337
00:13:15,500 --> 00:13:17,500
When Zhang Hao married Zhixia,

338
00:13:17,500 --> 00:13:19,060
we did not even mention betrothal money.

339
00:13:19,220 --> 00:13:21,140
Zhang Hao's family had their own flat.

340
00:13:21,420 --> 00:13:22,420
Do we have one?

341
00:13:22,420 --> 00:13:23,740
We do not.

342
00:13:24,900 --> 00:13:25,660
Poor folk.

343
00:13:27,420 --> 00:13:29,180
You are the poor folk.

344
00:13:29,180 --> 00:13:30,980
But Bichen's mom already said

345
00:13:31,340 --> 00:13:32,860
that once we give the money over,

346
00:13:32,870 --> 00:13:34,460
she will pass it on to the young couple.

347
00:13:34,460 --> 00:13:36,620
Those two, if I may say,
know what they are doing.

348
00:13:36,900 --> 00:13:37,460
Yes.

349
00:13:40,460 --> 00:13:41,060
Right.

350
00:13:42,380 --> 00:13:44,580
Bichen's parents
know what they are doing.

351
00:13:44,580 --> 00:13:45,180
They really do.

352
00:13:45,180 --> 00:13:46,060
- They do.
- Very much so.

353
00:13:46,060 --> 00:13:46,940
Yes, exactly.

354
00:13:47,100 --> 00:13:48,060
What are you doing?

355
00:13:48,060 --> 00:13:49,140
You are getting everything dirty.

356
00:13:49,140 --> 00:13:50,340
Do not touch that.

357
00:13:50,340 --> 00:13:51,860
It is dirty. Your hands are dirty too.

358
00:13:51,860 --> 00:13:54,820
This is the token of love
I made for Chen.

359
00:13:57,260 --> 00:13:57,860
This is lovely.

360
00:13:57,860 --> 00:13:59,820
Didn't we go to buy rings that day?

361
00:14:00,220 --> 00:14:01,820
Chen didn't choose the diamond one.

362
00:14:01,820 --> 00:14:03,380
She chose this pair of gold ones.

363
00:14:03,960 --> 00:14:05,580
To be honest,
I could tell straight away.

364
00:14:05,580 --> 00:14:07,340
Chen liked that six-prong diamond ring.

365
00:14:07,500 --> 00:14:08,780
She just wanted to save me money.

366
00:14:09,660 --> 00:14:10,940
My finances aren't great.

367
00:14:11,160 --> 00:14:12,540
So I'll make up for it with effort.

368
00:14:13,580 --> 00:14:14,340
Look.

369
00:14:14,780 --> 00:14:16,020
Bichen is a good girl.

370
00:14:16,020 --> 00:14:18,300
Yes, she really is a lovely child.

371
00:14:18,540 --> 00:14:19,140
Mom.

372
00:14:19,940 --> 00:14:20,980
Bichen's parents said

373
00:14:21,220 --> 00:14:22,860
they want to find a time to come over.

374
00:14:22,980 --> 00:14:25,260
To discuss the wedding banquet date
with you both again.

375
00:14:26,340 --> 00:14:27,420
They want to come over?

376
00:14:28,700 --> 00:14:31,020
Come over...

377
00:14:31,620 --> 00:14:32,660
Why are you looking at me?

378
00:14:33,020 --> 00:14:34,100
Answer your son.

379
00:14:36,340 --> 00:14:37,620
No problem.

380
00:14:37,980 --> 00:14:39,540
No problem. They are welcome.

381
00:14:39,820 --> 00:14:40,500
- Right.
- Yes.

382
00:14:40,500 --> 00:14:41,620
I will let Bichen know.

383
00:14:42,500 --> 00:14:43,140
Good. Tell her.

384
00:14:43,140 --> 00:14:43,820
All right.

385
00:14:43,820 --> 00:14:45,100
Good. Let's start cooking.

386
00:14:45,100 --> 00:14:45,900
Good. All right.

387
00:14:46,500 --> 00:14:47,100
All right.

388
00:15:02,580 --> 00:15:03,420
Thank you.

389
00:15:03,420 --> 00:15:04,220
You are welcome.

390
00:15:04,220 --> 00:15:05,580
Here. You have some too.

391
00:15:05,580 --> 00:15:07,100
(Best wishes to dear Dad, Mr. Li Bohai,
on his seventieth birthday.)

392
00:15:07,100 --> 00:15:08,060
Just look at you.

393
00:15:08,060 --> 00:15:09,500
You look so strong and healthy.

394
00:15:10,300 --> 00:15:10,740
Mingzhu.

395
00:15:11,620 --> 00:15:12,020
Mingzhu.

396
00:15:19,780 --> 00:15:20,980
Uncle.

397
00:15:20,980 --> 00:15:21,620
Long time no see.

398
00:15:21,620 --> 00:15:22,380
Jingzhe is here.

399
00:15:22,660 --> 00:15:24,420
Jingzhe really does have some ability.

400
00:15:24,660 --> 00:15:26,660
Uncle. Happy birthday.
Wishing you good health.

401
00:15:26,660 --> 00:15:28,300
Jingzhe, listen to me.

402
00:15:28,500 --> 00:15:30,180
Your thoughtfulness is enough.

403
00:15:30,180 --> 00:15:31,380
Keep the money.

404
00:15:31,540 --> 00:15:33,300
Young people have many expenses.

405
00:15:33,300 --> 00:15:33,780
No.

406
00:15:33,780 --> 00:15:35,380
You should know I have
nowhere to spend money.

407
00:15:35,380 --> 00:15:36,180
No. You keep it.

408
00:15:36,740 --> 00:15:37,300
Dad.

409
00:15:38,020 --> 00:15:39,220
This is Jingzhe's goodwill.

410
00:15:39,220 --> 00:15:41,020
- How could we not accept it?
- Yes.

411
00:15:41,020 --> 00:15:41,620
Listen.

412
00:15:41,620 --> 00:15:42,540
I will keep it for you.

413
00:15:42,540 --> 00:15:43,660
It is your birthday today.

414
00:15:45,180 --> 00:15:45,900
Jingzhe.

415
00:15:46,460 --> 00:15:47,180
Look.

416
00:15:47,180 --> 00:15:48,540
All the elders are sitting here.

417
00:15:48,540 --> 00:15:49,940
It is not suitable for you to sit here.

418
00:15:49,960 --> 00:15:51,260
There is an empty seat over there.

419
00:15:51,260 --> 00:15:52,380
Go and sit there.

420
00:15:53,180 --> 00:15:53,660
Alright.

421
00:15:53,690 --> 00:15:54,900
They are all the younger ones.

422
00:15:54,900 --> 00:15:55,900
Do not overthink it.

423
00:15:55,960 --> 00:15:57,080
Really. Do not overthink it.

424
00:15:59,180 --> 00:16:00,180
Little one is here.

425
00:16:00,180 --> 00:16:01,060
Come.

426
00:16:01,540 --> 00:16:02,100
Come here.

427
00:16:02,500 --> 00:16:04,180
Wish Grandpa a happy birthday.

428
00:16:06,420 --> 00:16:07,140
Call her Auntie.

429
00:16:14,380 --> 00:16:15,300
Mom.

430
00:16:17,700 --> 00:16:18,860
I am going to the toilet.

431
00:16:18,860 --> 00:16:20,260
You're annoying.

432
00:16:22,060 --> 00:16:24,700
Shall we invite
Chen's parents over tomorrow?

433
00:16:26,900 --> 00:16:27,460
You...

434
00:16:28,060 --> 00:16:30,620
Why are you in such a hurry?

435
00:16:32,260 --> 00:16:34,180
The furniture and everything

436
00:16:34,420 --> 00:16:35,700
is not even fully bought yet.

437
00:16:35,700 --> 00:16:37,540
Wait a few more days.

438
00:16:37,860 --> 00:16:39,140
Still a few more days.

439
00:16:39,660 --> 00:16:40,980
Mom, tell me the truth.

440
00:16:41,380 --> 00:16:42,940
Is it about my betrothal money?

441
00:16:43,700 --> 00:16:44,500
You child...

442
00:16:46,020 --> 00:16:47,180
You really go all out.

443
00:16:50,260 --> 00:16:52,500
No. What is happening to me?

444
00:16:55,700 --> 00:16:58,420
My menopause has already ended.

445
00:16:59,140 --> 00:17:00,540
Happy birthday, Dad.

446
00:17:00,540 --> 00:17:01,860
Dad, happy birthday.

447
00:17:02,020 --> 00:17:03,380
Thank you.

448
00:17:08,380 --> 00:17:08,980
Dad.

449
00:17:08,980 --> 00:17:10,500
Have some more.

450
00:17:10,500 --> 00:17:11,380
Alright.

451
00:17:11,380 --> 00:17:12,940
Have more. Eat more.

452
00:17:12,940 --> 00:17:13,620
Alright.

453
00:17:13,620 --> 00:17:14,180
Dad.

454
00:17:14,300 --> 00:17:15,420
It is such a good day today.

455
00:17:15,420 --> 00:17:16,420
Say a few words.

456
00:17:17,260 --> 00:17:18,740
Alright. I will listen to you

457
00:17:18,740 --> 00:17:19,540
and say something.

458
00:17:20,780 --> 00:17:21,660
Do not be angry later.

459
00:17:21,660 --> 00:17:22,660
Why would I be angry?

460
00:17:24,060 --> 00:17:25,540
Everyone, hold on a moment.

461
00:17:25,540 --> 00:17:27,220
Listen to my dad say a few words.

462
00:17:27,460 --> 00:17:28,500
Alright.

463
00:17:30,620 --> 00:17:33,460
(Longevity)

464
00:17:33,460 --> 00:17:34,700
Let me say a few words.

465
00:17:37,180 --> 00:17:38,740
Thank you to all my family and friends

466
00:17:39,300 --> 00:17:40,860
for taking the time

467
00:17:41,660 --> 00:17:43,620
to come and celebrate my birthday.

468
00:17:44,300 --> 00:17:45,180
I am truly grateful.

469
00:17:45,460 --> 00:17:46,460
Thank you.

470
00:17:47,060 --> 00:17:47,660
Alright.

471
00:17:51,060 --> 00:17:53,220
Time does not come back.

472
00:17:53,500 --> 00:17:55,300
In the blink of an eye, I am seventy.

473
00:17:56,780 --> 00:17:58,180
This whole journey

474
00:17:58,180 --> 00:18:00,660
has been full of ups and downs.

475
00:18:01,460 --> 00:18:03,500
To say life has no regrets

476
00:18:03,940 --> 00:18:04,780
would be a lie.

477
00:18:06,140 --> 00:18:07,260
But today

478
00:18:09,060 --> 00:18:10,740
when I look at the younger ones,

479
00:18:11,460 --> 00:18:12,780
I feel content.

480
00:18:13,780 --> 00:18:15,940
What makes me the proudest in my life

481
00:18:16,500 --> 00:18:18,060
is my nephew,

482
00:18:18,660 --> 00:18:19,300
Jingzhe.

483
00:18:21,540 --> 00:18:22,260
He

484
00:18:24,860 --> 00:18:26,220
has impeccable character.

485
00:18:26,780 --> 00:18:27,860
And to me,

486
00:18:28,540 --> 00:18:29,780
he is unfailingly good.

487
00:18:31,220 --> 00:18:31,900
Dad.

488
00:18:32,380 --> 00:18:33,620
Your own son is right here.

489
00:18:33,620 --> 00:18:34,740
Why are you only praising him?

490
00:18:34,740 --> 00:18:36,180
What do you mean by that?

491
00:18:36,180 --> 00:18:38,460
These past two years,

492
00:18:39,300 --> 00:18:41,060
I managed to save a bit of money.

493
00:18:42,260 --> 00:18:43,220
I thought

494
00:18:43,740 --> 00:18:45,780
at this stage of my life,

495
00:18:45,980 --> 00:18:48,220
I have eaten well and dressed well.

496
00:18:49,340 --> 00:18:52,020
And I have

497
00:18:52,980 --> 00:18:54,220
tried everything worth trying.

498
00:18:54,620 --> 00:18:56,860
So I decided to donate that money

499
00:18:57,100 --> 00:18:59,540
to the Children's Home.

500
00:19:00,380 --> 00:19:01,300
It is not much,

501
00:19:01,660 --> 00:19:02,780
just my small gesture.

502
00:19:03,220 --> 00:19:03,980
Dad.

503
00:19:03,980 --> 00:19:05,420
Why didn't you discuss this with me?

504
00:19:05,660 --> 00:19:06,980
Let me finish.

505
00:19:09,180 --> 00:19:10,180
Jingzhe.

506
00:19:11,260 --> 00:19:12,620
Come. Come here.

507
00:19:12,940 --> 00:19:13,460
Come.

508
00:19:13,460 --> 00:19:14,740
No. I am not going up.

509
00:19:15,580 --> 00:19:17,340
There is one last small matter.

510
00:19:17,860 --> 00:19:19,820
I have an insurance policy.

511
00:19:20,140 --> 00:19:22,140
The beneficiary is Jingzhe.

512
00:19:22,860 --> 00:19:23,860
I just think that

513
00:19:23,870 --> 00:19:24,900
- Dad.
- when I pass away later...

514
00:19:24,900 --> 00:19:25,780
I am your son.

515
00:19:25,780 --> 00:19:26,740
Why are you giving it to him?

516
00:19:26,740 --> 00:19:27,700
I want Jingzhe

517
00:19:28,260 --> 00:19:30,700
to donate that money as well,

518
00:19:30,700 --> 00:19:32,500
so it can go to those

519
00:19:32,500 --> 00:19:33,500
who truly need it.

520
00:19:33,500 --> 00:19:36,020
That will fulfill my last wish.

521
00:19:36,020 --> 00:19:36,380
No.

522
00:19:36,380 --> 00:19:37,060
Don't...

523
00:19:38,020 --> 00:19:39,620
Jingzhe.

524
00:19:40,700 --> 00:19:43,540
Can you tell me

525
00:19:44,180 --> 00:19:46,540
why you sold your own flat

526
00:19:46,540 --> 00:19:47,380
last month?

527
00:19:47,620 --> 00:19:49,260
No. We won't talk
about the second stage.

528
00:19:49,260 --> 00:19:50,340
We'll talk later, all right?

529
00:19:51,660 --> 00:19:52,540
The second stage?

530
00:19:53,500 --> 00:19:54,580
I already know.

531
00:19:55,700 --> 00:19:58,580
I just don't know how much more money

532
00:19:58,580 --> 00:19:59,700
and effort it will take.

533
00:19:59,700 --> 00:20:00,340
No. Wait a moment.

534
00:20:00,340 --> 00:20:01,220
What second stage?

535
00:20:01,220 --> 00:20:02,360
What are you two hinting at?

536
00:20:02,580 --> 00:20:03,420
What second stage?

537
00:20:04,980 --> 00:20:06,220
Stage two of liver cancer.

538
00:20:11,380 --> 00:20:12,220
Jingzhe...

539
00:20:18,220 --> 00:20:19,620
He sold the flat

540
00:20:20,540 --> 00:20:22,260
to pay for my treatment.

541
00:20:29,220 --> 00:20:30,380
Uncle.

542
00:20:30,380 --> 00:20:31,460
You can't drink now.

543
00:20:31,740 --> 00:20:32,420
Believe me.

544
00:20:32,780 --> 00:20:33,620
Just one last glass.

545
00:20:38,100 --> 00:20:38,900
What do you mean?

546
00:20:39,460 --> 00:20:40,580
What are you up to?

547
00:20:40,580 --> 00:20:41,900
When I asked you, you dodged it.

548
00:20:41,900 --> 00:20:42,820
You kept avoiding my questions.

549
00:20:42,820 --> 00:20:43,460
I'm telling you,

550
00:20:43,460 --> 00:20:44,340
today you must give me an answer.

551
00:20:44,340 --> 00:20:45,540
Family members,
please follow us to bring out the cake.

552
00:20:45,540 --> 00:20:46,780
Why are you here again?

553
00:20:46,780 --> 00:20:47,900
Can't you see I'm handling something?

554
00:20:47,900 --> 00:20:48,500
Stop shouting, will you?

555
00:20:48,500 --> 00:20:49,260
Why are you everywhere?

556
00:20:49,260 --> 00:20:49,660
Why can't I shout?

557
00:20:49,660 --> 00:20:50,300
I'll complain about you next time.

558
00:20:50,300 --> 00:20:51,140
Why can't I shout?

559
00:20:56,500 --> 00:20:57,140
Miss.

560
00:20:57,340 --> 00:20:58,180
Come here.

561
00:21:00,860 --> 00:21:02,180
This shredded tofu dish,

562
00:21:02,320 --> 00:21:04,340
I've eaten it in your restaurant
for twenty years.

563
00:21:04,740 --> 00:21:06,420
It has never once gone wrong.

564
00:21:08,060 --> 00:21:09,100
As long as you enjoy it.

565
00:21:09,420 --> 00:21:10,460
Dr. Li

566
00:21:10,700 --> 00:21:12,460
specifically asked us
to prepare it for you.

567
00:21:13,580 --> 00:21:14,340
All right.

568
00:21:14,500 --> 00:21:15,300
Then please

569
00:21:15,500 --> 00:21:17,260
take Jingzhe with you

570
00:21:17,260 --> 00:21:19,300
and bring my cake over.

571
00:21:19,300 --> 00:21:19,740
All right?

572
00:21:19,740 --> 00:21:20,620
Yes. No problem.

573
00:21:20,620 --> 00:21:21,950
- Thank you.
- You can rely on us.

574
00:21:22,380 --> 00:21:23,020
Brother.

575
00:21:23,340 --> 00:21:24,540
Is what Jingzhe said true?

576
00:21:24,540 --> 00:21:25,340
Let's go, Dr. Li.

577
00:21:26,140 --> 00:21:27,220
When did this happen?

578
00:21:27,220 --> 00:21:29,060
Why didn't you tell us?

579
00:21:33,660 --> 00:21:34,300
Come on.

580
00:21:34,360 --> 00:21:35,860
Didn't you say we're getting the cake?

581
00:21:37,660 --> 00:21:38,540
You're so naive.

582
00:21:39,380 --> 00:21:40,860
If you bring the cake back now,

583
00:21:41,260 --> 00:21:42,980
you'll walk straight back into the trap.

584
00:21:43,660 --> 00:21:44,300
Didn't you see

585
00:21:44,300 --> 00:21:45,860
your uncle was trying to get you out.

586
00:21:52,700 --> 00:21:54,660
Life really is dramatic.

587
00:21:57,540 --> 00:21:59,500
Good things and bad things link together

588
00:22:01,620 --> 00:22:02,940
and trap people step by step.

589
00:22:03,740 --> 00:22:06,460
I didn't expect your story
to be this dramatic too.

590
00:22:07,940 --> 00:22:10,020
Today went far beyond what I imagined.

591
00:22:11,620 --> 00:22:13,300
I didn't want anything this dramatic.

592
00:22:14,740 --> 00:22:16,380
I just wanted a simple life.

593
00:22:18,460 --> 00:22:19,620
Yet today

594
00:22:21,100 --> 00:22:23,380
the heavens seem
determined to overwhelm me.

595
00:22:24,340 --> 00:22:24,940
Yes.

596
00:22:26,100 --> 00:22:27,940
It arrived without a sound.

597
00:22:29,100 --> 00:22:30,580
Not a hint or warning.

598
00:22:33,100 --> 00:22:34,460
Isn't it like when you're hosting

599
00:22:34,680 --> 00:22:36,620
and they suddenly tell you
the programme changed,

600
00:22:36,900 --> 00:22:38,420
so the host must improvise on the spot?

601
00:22:40,420 --> 00:22:41,860
My mind just went blank.

602
00:22:42,260 --> 00:22:43,220
What could you do?

603
00:22:43,940 --> 00:22:44,940
Even without preparation,

604
00:22:46,300 --> 00:22:47,780
you still have to finish your lines.

605
00:22:51,180 --> 00:22:52,220
How is it, sister?

606
00:22:53,660 --> 00:22:55,540
No wonder your stomach hurt so badly

607
00:22:55,820 --> 00:22:56,980
and you were bleeding.

608
00:22:57,180 --> 00:22:59,420
Your coil has grown into the flesh.

609
00:23:03,940 --> 00:23:05,380
I forgot. I really forgot about it.

610
00:23:05,380 --> 00:23:06,820
You women

611
00:23:06,820 --> 00:23:08,180
look after everyone else

612
00:23:08,180 --> 00:23:09,780
except yourselves.

613
00:23:10,240 --> 00:23:12,020
It has been over two years
since menopause.

614
00:23:12,340 --> 00:23:14,140
Removing it now is much more difficult.

615
00:23:15,540 --> 00:23:18,500
So what should I do, Zhou?

616
00:23:18,740 --> 00:23:20,860
What else?
Go to the hospital to have it removed.

617
00:23:23,100 --> 00:23:25,140
I still have to go to the hospital?

618
00:23:26,540 --> 00:23:27,300
Zhou.

619
00:23:27,580 --> 00:23:29,980
Is the operation major or minor?

620
00:23:30,140 --> 00:23:30,940
Minor.

621
00:23:31,260 --> 00:23:33,540
A minor one. You can leave right after.

622
00:23:33,540 --> 00:23:35,300
Then why go to a big hospital?

623
00:23:35,900 --> 00:23:37,620
It's packed with people

624
00:23:37,620 --> 00:23:39,580
and wait in line for everything.

625
00:23:39,580 --> 00:23:40,940
It's such a hassle.

626
00:23:41,900 --> 00:23:44,340
And it's expensive too, isn't it?

627
00:23:46,780 --> 00:23:47,500
Zhou.

628
00:23:48,220 --> 00:23:50,300
Can you remove the coil?

629
00:23:50,700 --> 00:23:52,580
I can remove it.

630
00:23:52,820 --> 00:23:54,820
But many people don't dare to...

631
00:23:54,820 --> 00:23:55,500
I dare.

632
00:23:56,180 --> 00:23:57,420
Really, I do.

633
00:23:57,980 --> 00:23:59,860
You don't know what's happening at home.

634
00:24:01,020 --> 00:24:03,180
My son is about to get married.

635
00:24:03,180 --> 00:24:05,540
There's so much
waiting for me to handle.

636
00:24:05,540 --> 00:24:06,780
If I go to the hospital,

637
00:24:07,020 --> 00:24:08,460
I'll lose a whole day.

638
00:24:08,460 --> 00:24:09,380
I dare. I really do.

639
00:24:09,380 --> 00:24:10,260
Sister, I dare.

640
00:24:10,580 --> 00:24:11,580
If you dare, I dare.

641
00:24:12,460 --> 00:24:14,300
I used to work as a midwife
in the countryside.

642
00:24:14,300 --> 00:24:16,460
I delivered so many babies
with my bare hands.

643
00:24:16,460 --> 00:24:18,580
A tiny coil is nothing.

644
00:24:18,580 --> 00:24:19,260
Really?

645
00:24:22,500 --> 00:24:23,220
Let's do it.

646
00:24:23,780 --> 00:24:24,340
Come.

647
00:24:25,140 --> 00:24:25,940
Zhou.

648
00:24:27,020 --> 00:24:28,580
Why haven't you started yet?

649
00:24:29,180 --> 00:24:31,180
Even a small operation
is still an operation.

650
00:24:31,320 --> 00:24:33,620
I need to disinfect everything
and be responsible for you.

651
00:24:33,940 --> 00:24:35,540
Thank you, sister.

652
00:24:36,100 --> 00:24:38,380
Just please be quick.

653
00:24:39,140 --> 00:24:40,700
Or I won't make it back in time

654
00:24:41,260 --> 00:24:42,540
to cook for them.

655
00:24:42,900 --> 00:24:44,150
Look at the situation you're in.

656
00:24:44,160 --> 00:24:46,260
And you're still thinking
about cooking for others.

657
00:24:47,100 --> 00:24:48,140
Let's begin.

658
00:24:48,140 --> 00:24:48,580
Alright.

659
00:24:48,580 --> 00:24:49,460
Legs apart.

660
00:24:49,980 --> 00:24:50,860
Don't be nervous.

661
00:24:51,260 --> 00:24:52,780
It'll be over soon.

662
00:24:53,340 --> 00:24:54,780
It might hurt a little.

663
00:24:56,020 --> 00:24:58,740
Pain has never scared me.

664
00:25:00,980 --> 00:25:03,020
Don't move. Don't tense up.

665
00:25:04,180 --> 00:25:04,980
Almost.

666
00:25:09,700 --> 00:25:11,820
Alright, the coil is out.

667
00:25:13,940 --> 00:25:14,940
Wait a moment.

668
00:25:15,900 --> 00:25:19,100
There seems to be a small stone
growing beside it.

669
00:25:19,460 --> 00:25:20,660
Bear with it for a bit.

670
00:25:20,900 --> 00:25:21,980
I'll pull it out.

671
00:25:21,980 --> 00:25:22,620
Alright.

672
00:25:22,860 --> 00:25:25,420
Pull it. Pull it. Pull it.

673
00:25:33,500 --> 00:25:34,340
Oh no.

674
00:25:35,980 --> 00:25:36,940
She's bleeding.

675
00:25:40,100 --> 00:25:42,060
Don't panic. Stay calm.

676
00:25:42,060 --> 00:25:43,780
I'll call emergency services.

677
00:25:48,860 --> 00:25:50,580
Auntie, wake up.

678
00:25:50,580 --> 00:25:51,420
You mustn't sleep.

679
00:25:51,860 --> 00:25:52,420
Auntie.

680
00:25:53,300 --> 00:25:53,940
Auntie.

681
00:25:57,820 --> 00:25:59,860
Who are you?

682
00:25:59,860 --> 00:26:01,140
I'm a doctor, auntie.

683
00:26:01,260 --> 00:26:02,700
We're taking you to the hospital now.

684
00:26:03,260 --> 00:26:04,700
We'll be there very soon.

685
00:26:09,780 --> 00:26:14,660
I still have so much to do.

686
00:26:15,360 --> 00:26:16,340
Maybe I should go back.

687
00:26:17,100 --> 00:26:18,180
Avoiding it won't help.

688
00:26:19,180 --> 00:26:20,900
What about the cake? Is the cake real?

689
00:26:21,180 --> 00:26:22,380
Of course the cake is real.

690
00:26:22,740 --> 00:26:23,380
Let's go.

691
00:26:25,380 --> 00:26:26,460
I need to take this call.

692
00:26:26,460 --> 00:26:27,520
I need to take a call too.

693
00:26:28,500 --> 00:26:29,100
Hello.

694
00:26:29,300 --> 00:26:30,180
Hello, Zhixia.

695
00:26:31,180 --> 00:26:32,270
Where's the doctor on duty?

696
00:26:33,620 --> 00:26:35,410
Have they taken her
to the People's Hospital?

697
00:26:35,970 --> 00:26:36,740
Didn't I say earlier

698
00:26:36,740 --> 00:26:37,780
- my uncle's birthday is today?
- Calm down.

699
00:26:37,780 --> 00:26:38,780
I'm going over right now.

700
00:26:40,880 --> 00:26:42,080
I need to get to the hospital.

701
00:26:42,380 --> 00:26:43,900
Can I get a lift with you?

702
00:26:43,900 --> 00:26:45,180
I need to go to the hospital too.

703
00:26:46,540 --> 00:26:47,780
Zhixia's mom is bleeding heavily

704
00:26:47,780 --> 00:26:49,210
and has been taken to your hospital.

705
00:26:49,220 --> 00:26:51,020
Please help keep an eye on her later.

706
00:26:51,020 --> 00:26:51,580
Alright.

707
00:26:52,540 --> 00:26:54,340
Is heavy bleeding dangerous?

708
00:26:54,340 --> 00:26:55,020
Hard to say yet.

709
00:26:55,020 --> 00:26:55,700
We'll know when we see her.
The sooner the better.

710
00:26:55,700 --> 00:26:56,220
Alright.

711
00:27:03,340 --> 00:27:03,900
Zhixia.

712
00:27:04,360 --> 00:27:05,420
I've reached the hospital.

713
00:27:05,960 --> 00:27:07,220
Where's the emergency department?

714
00:27:07,220 --> 00:27:07,900
That way.

715
00:27:09,160 --> 00:27:10,420
Alright. I'm heading to emergency now.

716
00:27:11,420 --> 00:27:13,020
Toothbrush, toothpaste and a towel.

717
00:27:13,480 --> 00:27:15,180
Right, there are new socks
in the drawer.

718
00:27:15,180 --> 00:27:15,780
Bring them.

719
00:27:15,780 --> 00:27:17,480
My mom likes to wear socks
when she sleeps.

720
00:27:18,140 --> 00:27:19,420
Drop the things off first.

721
00:27:19,420 --> 00:27:20,780
Then pick up Jiao, alright?

722
00:27:21,860 --> 00:27:23,460
I'll go down and get them.

723
00:27:24,760 --> 00:27:25,500
The plasma's here.

724
00:27:25,500 --> 00:27:26,620
Where's the rest?

725
00:27:26,630 --> 00:27:27,540
Another twenty minutes.

726
00:27:27,540 --> 00:27:28,460
Not sure if it'll be enough.

727
00:27:28,460 --> 00:27:29,380
Alright. Hurry.

728
00:27:29,390 --> 00:27:30,340
If it's not enough, use mine.

729
00:27:30,340 --> 00:27:31,100
Me too.

730
00:27:31,340 --> 00:27:32,260
I can donate as well.

731
00:27:32,260 --> 00:27:33,740
What's your relation to the patient?

732
00:27:34,940 --> 00:27:36,260
We're her children.

733
00:27:36,260 --> 00:27:37,860
Direct relatives
donating blood is risky.

734
00:27:37,860 --> 00:27:39,210
And your blood types might not match.

735
00:27:39,220 --> 00:27:39,860
Nurse.

736
00:27:40,260 --> 00:27:41,380
I'm her husband.

737
00:27:41,620 --> 00:27:43,100
We have the same blood type.

738
00:27:43,100 --> 00:27:43,900
Can I donate?

739
00:27:43,900 --> 00:27:44,980
Yes. Come with me.

740
00:27:45,180 --> 00:27:45,780
Alright.

741
00:27:46,460 --> 00:27:47,180
Dad, I...

742
00:27:47,620 --> 00:27:48,900
Don't follow me.

743
00:27:48,900 --> 00:27:49,820
Stay with your mom.

744
00:27:55,780 --> 00:27:57,500
Don't worry too much. She'll be fine.

745
00:27:58,140 --> 00:27:58,740
Sit.

746
00:28:09,300 --> 00:28:11,700
(This day and this moment)

747
00:28:12,380 --> 00:28:13,940
(made me realise that with this family,)

748
00:28:14,340 --> 00:28:17,220
(our lives are tied together
by blood and there's no escaping it.)

749
00:28:25,140 --> 00:28:27,620
(A peaceful home brings prosperity)

750
00:28:28,660 --> 00:28:29,220
Pass it to me.

751
00:28:29,840 --> 00:28:30,500
What do you want?

752
00:28:37,260 --> 00:28:38,180
Didn't our daughter say

753
00:28:38,180 --> 00:28:39,470
she'd be home for dinner tonight?

754
00:28:39,480 --> 00:28:40,380
Why isn't she back yet?

755
00:28:40,750 --> 00:28:41,980
She's probably busy these days.

756
00:28:42,380 --> 00:28:44,140
Didn't she mention some banquet?

757
00:28:44,540 --> 00:28:45,420
That's what I think.

758
00:28:45,900 --> 00:28:46,500
Mom.

759
00:28:47,620 --> 00:28:49,540
Mom, Mingzhu said
she'll be back later tonight.

760
00:28:49,940 --> 00:28:50,460
What?

761
00:28:50,460 --> 00:28:52,300
Her biological mother
is in emergency care.

762
00:28:54,140 --> 00:28:54,820
What happened?

763
00:28:55,260 --> 00:28:56,660
She's had massive bleeding.

764
00:28:56,860 --> 00:28:57,620
It's serious.

765
00:28:58,320 --> 00:28:59,700
What do you mean, massive bleeding?

766
00:28:59,700 --> 00:29:00,620
Was it a car accident?

767
00:29:00,820 --> 00:29:01,380
No.

768
00:29:02,060 --> 00:29:04,060
She was having a ring removed.

769
00:29:05,860 --> 00:29:06,740
Alright, I know.

770
00:29:07,060 --> 00:29:07,840
I'm going upstairs.

771
00:29:11,820 --> 00:29:12,700
Removing the ring?

772
00:29:17,340 --> 00:29:18,540
Dr. Li, how is she?

773
00:29:18,540 --> 00:29:19,340
She's stabilized.

774
00:29:20,580 --> 00:29:21,500
Dr. Li.

775
00:29:21,500 --> 00:29:22,700
Thank you so much.

776
00:29:22,700 --> 00:29:24,620
You've saved our family's life.

777
00:29:24,620 --> 00:29:25,500
You're welcome, uncle.

778
00:29:25,500 --> 00:29:26,180
It's my duty.

779
00:29:26,180 --> 00:29:26,700
Mom.

780
00:29:27,100 --> 00:29:28,500
Be gentle. She's not awake yet.

781
00:29:29,180 --> 00:29:29,860
Alright, I know.

782
00:29:29,860 --> 00:29:30,580
Thank you.

783
00:29:30,580 --> 00:29:31,740
How many days does she need to stay?

784
00:29:31,740 --> 00:29:32,660
Depends on her recovery.

785
00:29:32,660 --> 00:29:33,540
Probably a week.

786
00:29:33,940 --> 00:29:35,140
Uncle, go with them.

787
00:29:35,140 --> 00:29:36,180
Thank you, Dr. Li.

788
00:29:36,180 --> 00:29:36,780
Thank you.

789
00:29:36,780 --> 00:29:37,380
Mom.

790
00:29:37,940 --> 00:29:38,860
- Mom.
- Xiang.

791
00:29:40,340 --> 00:29:41,100
Dr. Li.

792
00:29:41,100 --> 00:29:42,940
When my wife is discharged,
I'll buy you a drink.

793
00:29:42,940 --> 00:29:43,700
Alright, uncle.

794
00:29:43,700 --> 00:29:44,860
Alright. See you later.

795
00:29:44,860 --> 00:29:45,300
Thank you.

796
00:29:45,300 --> 00:29:45,820
Uncle.

797
00:29:45,940 --> 00:29:46,780
Go on.

798
00:29:46,780 --> 00:29:47,380
Alright.

799
00:29:56,340 --> 00:29:58,820
This Yu Jingxiang is...

800
00:30:04,850 --> 00:30:06,140
I honestly cannot figure it out.

801
00:30:06,140 --> 00:30:09,060
Xu Dacheng and his wife
are already at their age.

802
00:30:09,680 --> 00:30:11,380
Why are they
still having the ring removed?

803
00:30:11,440 --> 00:30:12,740
And ending up bleeding like that?

804
00:30:13,540 --> 00:30:14,660
Goodness me.

805
00:30:14,820 --> 00:30:16,980
This woman is just...

806
00:30:17,540 --> 00:30:18,660
Far too much trouble.

807
00:30:19,220 --> 00:30:20,380
Women are trouble.

808
00:30:20,380 --> 00:30:22,160
Once men are involved
it becomes even worse.

809
00:30:22,880 --> 00:30:23,980
Bleeding during pregnancy.

810
00:30:23,980 --> 00:30:25,020
Bleeding after an abortion.

811
00:30:25,020 --> 00:30:26,060
Bleeding from ring removal.

812
00:30:26,060 --> 00:30:27,460
Giving birth bleeds even more.

813
00:30:27,660 --> 00:30:29,780
Nothing good ever comes from it
when men are involved.

814
00:30:30,860 --> 00:30:32,820
Why are you so fired up?

815
00:30:33,140 --> 00:30:35,260
I do not understand, so I am asking you.

816
00:30:35,260 --> 00:30:35,900
Asking what?

817
00:30:35,900 --> 00:30:37,620
It is easy for men to become fathers.

818
00:30:37,620 --> 00:30:38,340
But women…

819
00:30:38,340 --> 00:30:39,740
We risk our lives every single time.

820
00:30:41,700 --> 00:30:43,260
Why are you so angry?

821
00:30:43,580 --> 00:30:44,620
Dad, Mom.

822
00:30:45,380 --> 00:30:46,380
I am back.

823
00:30:46,380 --> 00:30:47,660
My girl is home.

824
00:30:48,220 --> 00:30:48,580
Dad.

825
00:30:48,580 --> 00:30:49,740
Come on, dinner is ready.

826
00:30:49,900 --> 00:30:52,980
Your mom
even simmered chicken soup for you.

827
00:30:52,980 --> 00:30:54,060
I am starving.

828
00:30:56,820 --> 00:30:58,020
Mom, you made chicken soup?

829
00:31:01,420 --> 00:31:02,940
Look, it is still hot.

830
00:31:03,960 --> 00:31:04,900
Do not eat the leftovers.

831
00:31:04,900 --> 00:31:06,220
This is the portion saved for you.

832
00:31:07,380 --> 00:31:08,220
I thought Yu

833
00:31:08,220 --> 00:31:09,580
would treat you to a big dinner.

834
00:31:10,220 --> 00:31:11,980
Nothing tastes better
than home-cooked food.

835
00:31:16,980 --> 00:31:18,460
So how is she now?

836
00:31:18,640 --> 00:31:20,280
She just made it past the danger period.

837
00:31:20,290 --> 00:31:22,150
Dr. Li said she needs
to stay for observation.

838
00:31:22,160 --> 00:31:23,470
She still needs ongoing treatment.

839
00:31:23,860 --> 00:31:24,820
It is that serious?

840
00:31:24,840 --> 00:31:26,520
Then who is staying
with her in hospital?

841
00:31:27,640 --> 00:31:28,660
Zhidong is staying tonight

842
00:31:28,660 --> 00:31:29,660
and Zhixia will take tomorrow.

843
00:31:29,660 --> 00:31:30,860
The two of them are taking turns.

844
00:31:30,860 --> 00:31:32,500
Her son does not understand anything.

845
00:31:32,500 --> 00:31:33,540
And her daughter

846
00:31:33,540 --> 00:31:34,980
is pregnant with her second child.

847
00:31:35,780 --> 00:31:36,900
What about her husband?

848
00:31:36,900 --> 00:31:37,820
Is he doing nothing?

849
00:31:38,260 --> 00:31:39,580
Yes, that Xu Dacheng…

850
00:31:39,900 --> 00:31:41,220
He really is unreliable.

851
00:31:44,020 --> 00:31:44,760
Serves him right.

852
00:31:44,770 --> 00:31:46,450
He does not
even look after his own child.

853
00:31:46,540 --> 00:31:48,540
What are you doing?

854
00:31:50,160 --> 00:31:51,380
Why are you taking the chicken?

855
00:31:51,380 --> 00:31:53,580
There's already chicken
simmering in the pot.

856
00:31:53,580 --> 00:31:54,980
It's all cooked into soup.

857
00:31:55,580 --> 00:31:56,500
Why so many questions?

858
00:31:56,500 --> 00:31:57,860
Isn't that for our daughter?

859
00:31:59,500 --> 00:32:00,700
This one's for that poor woman.

860
00:32:02,940 --> 00:32:04,900
I must have owed her in a past life.

861
00:32:04,900 --> 00:32:06,340
I'll never repay it in this one.

862
00:32:07,180 --> 00:32:07,820
Mom.

863
00:32:08,100 --> 00:32:09,500
You really are beautiful and kind.

864
00:32:09,700 --> 00:32:10,420
What did you say?

865
00:32:10,420 --> 00:32:11,540
Beautiful and kind.

866
00:32:11,540 --> 00:32:12,700
I've had a brain puncture.

867
00:32:12,700 --> 00:32:13,700
Beautiful and kind...

868
00:32:14,700 --> 00:32:15,750
There's something wrong with me.

869
00:32:39,460 --> 00:32:40,140
Zhidong.

870
00:32:40,260 --> 00:32:41,820
Are you staying at the hospital tonight?

871
00:32:42,100 --> 00:32:43,460
I will bring you some food.

872
00:32:44,820 --> 00:32:45,460
No need.

873
00:32:47,860 --> 00:32:49,020
I don't want to eat anything.

874
00:32:49,020 --> 00:32:49,940
I've no appetite.

875
00:32:52,740 --> 00:32:54,580
I've been terrified these past two days.

876
00:32:55,420 --> 00:32:57,100
I almost lost my mom.

877
00:33:01,380 --> 00:33:02,660
Chen, I'll talk to you later.

878
00:33:06,060 --> 00:33:06,660
Mom.

879
00:33:08,340 --> 00:33:09,020
Mom.

880
00:33:10,340 --> 00:33:10,940
Mom.

881
00:33:16,660 --> 00:33:17,260
Mom.

882
00:33:17,940 --> 00:33:18,540
Mom.

883
00:33:47,700 --> 00:33:50,580
(Third One Building)

884
00:33:50,580 --> 00:33:54,140
(Teachers' Office)

885
00:34:00,660 --> 00:34:01,300
Minghui.

886
00:34:02,300 --> 00:34:03,320
- Come over.
- Come on.

887
00:34:04,360 --> 00:34:05,580
- You go over there.
- Go on.

888
00:34:08,860 --> 00:34:10,180
Should I catch up on maths first

889
00:34:10,580 --> 00:34:11,860
or physics first?

890
00:34:12,220 --> 00:34:13,020
Teachers.

891
00:34:14,760 --> 00:34:16,380
Why don't you two have a little contest?

892
00:34:17,060 --> 00:34:17,660
Look at him.

893
00:34:18,240 --> 00:34:19,580
He really thinks he's a treasure.

894
00:34:28,100 --> 00:34:28,980
Start with physics.

895
00:34:30,170 --> 00:34:31,700
I'm going to the cafeteria for a meal.

896
00:34:36,160 --> 00:34:36,900
What are you doing?

897
00:34:38,620 --> 00:34:39,460
Mr. Sun.

898
00:34:40,100 --> 00:34:41,620
I was too impulsive when I complained

899
00:34:42,180 --> 00:34:43,660
to the headmaster last time.

900
00:34:44,500 --> 00:34:45,260
I'm sorry.

901
00:34:47,460 --> 00:34:49,060
So you do know it was wrong.

902
00:34:50,460 --> 00:34:51,380
Let me tell you.

903
00:34:51,660 --> 00:34:53,220
I was young once too.

904
00:34:53,660 --> 00:34:54,700
But what you did…

905
00:34:54,700 --> 00:34:55,540
I know.

906
00:34:56,340 --> 00:34:58,420
That's why
I came to apologise in person.

907
00:35:00,280 --> 00:35:02,140
I've got high blood pressure,
high blood sugar and high cholesterol.

908
00:35:02,140 --> 00:35:02,940
I know.

909
00:35:03,260 --> 00:35:04,460
I braised this myself.

910
00:35:04,460 --> 00:35:05,700
I chose lean meat on purpose.

911
00:35:05,900 --> 00:35:07,220
Low oil and low sugar.

912
00:35:09,380 --> 00:35:10,220
Thank you.

913
00:35:10,500 --> 00:35:11,540
Start with physics.

914
00:35:11,650 --> 00:35:12,700
I'm going to the cafeteria.

915
00:35:12,700 --> 00:35:13,380
Go eat first.

916
00:35:13,380 --> 00:35:14,300
Goodbye, Mr. Sun.

917
00:35:14,940 --> 00:35:15,580
Okay.

918
00:35:16,260 --> 00:35:16,820
Minghui.

919
00:35:16,820 --> 00:35:18,300
Bring that small stool over.

920
00:35:29,260 --> 00:35:31,020
Show me yesterday's

921
00:35:31,020 --> 00:35:32,020
mock exam paper.

922
00:35:32,820 --> 00:35:33,900
(Shen's Pork Chops. Limited Supply)
The chops are sold out.

923
00:35:34,140 --> 00:35:35,060
Stop queuing.

924
00:35:36,080 --> 00:35:37,100
- Sold out.
- None left.

925
00:35:38,620 --> 00:35:39,740
They sold out this fast.

926
00:35:40,470 --> 00:35:41,300
One serving of rice.

927
00:35:48,940 --> 00:35:49,780
What dish is that?

928
00:35:49,790 --> 00:35:50,900
Aubergine. Braised aubergine.

929
00:35:50,900 --> 00:35:51,780
No.

930
00:35:52,560 --> 00:35:52,940
This one.

931
00:35:52,960 --> 00:35:54,180
One portion of tomato and egg.

932
00:35:54,340 --> 00:35:54,860
Alright.

933
00:35:57,180 --> 00:35:58,020
No lotus root?

934
00:35:58,180 --> 00:35:59,140
There is. Here.

935
00:35:59,140 --> 00:36:00,290
Yes, give me some lotus root.

936
00:36:04,860 --> 00:36:05,900
I've still got a chop left.

937
00:36:06,460 --> 00:36:07,380
Okay. Thank you.

938
00:36:10,080 --> 00:36:10,700
Let me tell you.

939
00:36:11,380 --> 00:36:13,580
You can order more pork chops each day.

940
00:36:13,900 --> 00:36:14,660
- Right?
- Right.

941
00:36:15,060 --> 00:36:15,460
Yes.

942
00:36:15,780 --> 00:36:17,140
The students love them.

943
00:36:17,380 --> 00:36:18,340
Yes, they do.

944
00:36:21,940 --> 00:36:22,500
Look.

945
00:36:23,460 --> 00:36:25,180
L2 is cut.

946
00:36:25,820 --> 00:36:27,460
F2 disappears.

947
00:36:27,860 --> 00:36:30,460
Then the small ball
will swing down, won't it?

948
00:36:31,420 --> 00:36:33,900
And once it swings down,
the tension in L1

949
00:36:33,900 --> 00:36:35,300
will change, won't it?

950
00:36:36,340 --> 00:36:37,660
Now that we know this condition,

951
00:36:37,660 --> 00:36:39,860
this next question should
be easy to pick, shouldn't it?

952
00:36:40,700 --> 00:36:41,340
Which one?

953
00:36:55,300 --> 00:36:56,300
Shen Minghui.

954
00:36:57,140 --> 00:37:00,020
You don't pass exams by praying.

955
00:37:00,660 --> 00:37:01,900
You're very bright.

956
00:37:02,700 --> 00:37:04,220
So why can't you put that energy

957
00:37:04,220 --> 00:37:05,700
into studying?

958
00:37:06,420 --> 00:37:08,460
Lu Bing has strong grades.

959
00:37:09,020 --> 00:37:10,700
So you should work even harder

960
00:37:10,700 --> 00:37:12,860
and try to catch up with her,
shouldn't you?

961
00:37:15,260 --> 00:37:16,020
Mr. Hu.

962
00:37:17,500 --> 00:37:18,940
Your grades were excellent.

963
00:37:22,940 --> 00:37:24,100
So why are you still single?

964
00:37:28,180 --> 00:37:28,980
Quiet down.

965
00:37:33,500 --> 00:37:35,140
Stop worrying about whether L2 or L1

966
00:37:35,140 --> 00:37:36,140
will change.

967
00:37:37,380 --> 00:37:38,660
Will Feng Meiqi change?

968
00:37:41,670 --> 00:37:42,510
Look at the question.

969
00:37:42,900 --> 00:37:43,580
Which one?

970
00:37:44,340 --> 00:37:44,900
C.

971
00:37:55,180 --> 00:37:55,700
Mom.

972
00:37:55,900 --> 00:37:57,860
You look much better today.

973
00:37:57,860 --> 00:37:58,460
Okay.

974
00:37:58,620 --> 00:37:59,460
Higher? Is that okay?

975
00:37:59,460 --> 00:38:00,660
Yes, son.

976
00:38:01,300 --> 00:38:02,020
That's good.

977
00:38:06,660 --> 00:38:08,700
My son has worked so hard.

978
00:38:08,980 --> 00:38:09,500
It's fine.

979
00:38:10,180 --> 00:38:11,060
Wipe your hands.

980
00:38:11,060 --> 00:38:12,880
Your sister will be here soon,
then we'll eat.

981
00:38:23,460 --> 00:38:24,100
Zhidong.

982
00:38:24,420 --> 00:38:24,940
Zhixia.

983
00:38:25,140 --> 00:38:26,380
Hurry, go home and rest.

984
00:38:26,380 --> 00:38:26,750
I'm here.

985
00:38:27,100 --> 00:38:29,740
I… I don't think I'll make it to work.

986
00:38:29,750 --> 00:38:31,540
It's still early,
you can sleep for half an hour.

987
00:38:31,540 --> 00:38:32,580
Yes, at noon

988
00:38:32,580 --> 00:38:34,700
take a short nap at the office.

989
00:38:34,700 --> 00:38:35,740
Mom, stop worrying.

990
00:38:35,740 --> 00:38:36,860
Our shift is easy.

991
00:38:36,860 --> 00:38:37,420
All right.

992
00:38:37,420 --> 00:38:38,700
Zhixia, pour the water, please.

993
00:38:38,940 --> 00:38:39,660
Slow down.

994
00:38:39,660 --> 00:38:41,020
Yes, a bit slower.

995
00:38:42,260 --> 00:38:43,460
Your son

996
00:38:43,700 --> 00:38:44,900
has really grown sensible.

997
00:38:46,540 --> 00:38:48,700
Of course, he's my boy.

998
00:38:53,180 --> 00:38:55,140
This is the fish soup
my dad made for you.

999
00:38:55,620 --> 00:38:57,540
He didn't add any MSG. Have a smell.

1000
00:38:58,940 --> 00:38:59,580
Too oily.

1001
00:39:00,660 --> 00:39:02,500
Drink a little. It's good for nutrition.

1002
00:39:10,980 --> 00:39:11,820
Mingzhu.

1003
00:39:12,900 --> 00:39:13,700
You're here.

1004
00:39:14,380 --> 00:39:15,820
My mom made some chicken soup.

1005
00:39:16,020 --> 00:39:16,980
It's really nourishing.

1006
00:39:18,660 --> 00:39:20,180
Your... Your mom…

1007
00:39:20,540 --> 00:39:23,260
Your mom brought chicken soup for me?

1008
00:39:24,860 --> 00:39:27,540
Your mom is such a kind person.

1009
00:39:28,940 --> 00:39:30,060
I need to thank her.

1010
00:39:30,540 --> 00:39:32,260
Please thank her for me later.

1011
00:39:32,260 --> 00:39:32,900
Okay.

1012
00:39:33,580 --> 00:39:34,620
I'll ladle you a bowl.

1013
00:39:36,860 --> 00:39:37,420
Go ahead.

1014
00:39:52,380 --> 00:39:52,940
Here.

1015
00:39:57,740 --> 00:39:58,980
It smells wonderful.

1016
00:39:59,540 --> 00:40:02,020
It really does smell wonderful.

1017
00:40:13,300 --> 00:40:14,140
It tastes good.

1018
00:40:15,380 --> 00:40:17,020
It's really good.

1019
00:40:17,420 --> 00:40:18,980
I served my mom fish soup earlier,

1020
00:40:18,980 --> 00:40:20,150
and she said it was too oily.

1021
00:40:23,180 --> 00:40:24,300
There's a drumstick too.

1022
00:40:24,420 --> 00:40:25,700
Go on and eat it, all right?

1023
00:40:27,660 --> 00:40:29,500
Okay, okay.

1024
00:40:40,500 --> 00:40:41,380
All my life,

1025
00:40:42,340 --> 00:40:44,620
I've never eaten a drumstick.

1026
00:40:52,660 --> 00:40:53,340
Delicious.

1027
00:40:55,340 --> 00:40:56,100
Delicious.

1028
00:41:00,340 --> 00:41:01,100
Delicious.

1029
00:41:03,980 --> 00:41:06,340
I went through
the gates of death this time.

1030
00:41:09,500 --> 00:41:10,300
It was worth it.

1031
00:41:14,180 --> 00:41:14,940
Worth it.

1032
00:41:20,180 --> 00:41:20,980
Mingzhu.

1033
00:41:21,420 --> 00:41:23,180
You don't look very pregnant at all.

1034
00:41:24,700 --> 00:41:25,420
The baby's there.

1035
00:41:26,420 --> 00:41:27,180
It really is.

1036
00:41:29,620 --> 00:41:30,700
Thank you for today.

1037
00:41:31,220 --> 00:41:32,140
Once you arrived,

1038
00:41:32,700 --> 00:41:34,180
Madam Yu suddenly looked much better.

1039
00:41:35,540 --> 00:41:36,540
You said it yourself.

1040
00:41:36,540 --> 00:41:38,360
We don't need
to be so polite with each other.

1041
00:41:42,540 --> 00:41:43,980
To be honest, my mom

1042
00:41:45,020 --> 00:41:45,980
has had a hard life.

1043
00:41:47,380 --> 00:41:49,020
She wasn't exaggerating at all just now.

1044
00:41:49,860 --> 00:41:51,700
She really has never eaten a drumstick.

1045
00:41:53,180 --> 00:41:54,420
The family was poor back then.

1046
00:41:55,180 --> 00:41:56,150
They couldn't afford it.

1047
00:41:56,740 --> 00:41:58,220
After Zhidong and I were born,

1048
00:41:59,380 --> 00:42:00,700
she had to put us first.

1049
00:42:01,820 --> 00:42:04,220
Over time, she simply got used to it.

1050
00:42:04,220 --> 00:42:05,420
It became muscle memory.

1051
00:42:05,900 --> 00:42:06,820
She'd think she

1052
00:42:07,500 --> 00:42:10,860
liked chewing on necks
or gnawing on feet.

1053
00:42:11,700 --> 00:42:12,860
My mom is the same.

1054
00:42:13,700 --> 00:42:14,660
Growing up,

1055
00:42:14,980 --> 00:42:17,020
the drumsticks always
went to my brother and me.

1056
00:42:20,300 --> 00:42:21,020
Yes.

1057
00:42:22,180 --> 00:42:23,180
Same world,

1058
00:42:24,180 --> 00:42:25,100
same kind of mom.

1059
00:42:26,940 --> 00:42:27,580
Oh, right.

1060
00:42:28,180 --> 00:42:29,340
Something was odd today.

1061
00:42:29,980 --> 00:42:32,580
Your mom actually made soup for my mom.

1062
00:42:32,860 --> 00:42:34,580
She's sharp-tongued but soft-hearted.

1063
00:42:36,140 --> 00:42:37,140
Without my mom,

1064
00:42:38,260 --> 00:42:39,860
I wouldn't have dared to keep this baby.

1065
00:42:40,140 --> 00:42:42,340
And I definitely wouldn't have dared
to be a single mom.
