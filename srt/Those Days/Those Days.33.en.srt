00:01:12,431 --> 00:01:14,800
(Adapted from iceread.com novel
"You Xi" by Qingyang Wanxi)

00:01:14,980 --> 00:01:17,980
=Episode 33=

4
00:01:40,180 --> 00:01:42,380
(Nanzhou New District People's Court.)
(Sealed)

5
00:01:57,839 --> 00:01:59,000
Why are you here?

6
00:02:00,640 --> 00:02:02,440
I came to bring you something.

7
00:02:02,960 --> 00:02:03,800
Keep your voice down.

8
00:02:04,048 --> 00:02:04,960
Keep your voice down.

9
00:02:06,119 --> 00:02:06,919
Let me do it.

10
00:02:06,919 --> 00:02:08,200
Come, I'll change my shoes.

11
00:02:08,559 --> 00:02:09,559
Go sit.

12
00:02:10,599 --> 00:02:11,200
What's wrong?

13
00:02:12,360 --> 00:02:13,599
Mingzhu fell asleep.

14
00:02:13,999 --> 00:02:14,879
She's asleep?

15
00:02:16,480 --> 00:02:17,399
What's wrong with her?

16
00:02:18,320 --> 00:02:18,960
Nothing.

17
00:02:20,040 --> 00:02:21,480
Mom, why are you here?

18
00:02:22,839 --> 00:02:24,240
Why can't I come?

19
00:02:24,260 --> 00:02:26,750
It's my daughter's home.
I have to report to you before coming?

20
00:02:27,719 --> 00:02:28,520
Come, sit.

21
00:02:28,520 --> 00:02:29,040
Come.

22
00:02:30,080 --> 00:02:30,920
Come, sit.

23
00:02:32,279 --> 00:02:32,879
Well...

24
00:02:33,839 --> 00:02:34,559
Are you okay?

25
00:02:34,559 --> 00:02:35,159
I'm fine.

26
00:02:35,220 --> 00:02:36,960
Don't busy yourself.
Mrs. Feng, I'll do it.

27
00:02:36,960 --> 00:02:37,879
Sit down, it's fine.

28
00:02:37,879 --> 00:02:39,200
Let my Mother-in-law do it.

29
00:02:39,520 --> 00:02:41,599
She needs more exercise,
which helps her recovery.

30
00:02:43,719 --> 00:02:44,719
Here, have some water.

31
00:02:44,719 --> 00:02:46,320
Wow, not bad.

32
00:02:47,559 --> 00:02:49,119
I've recovered very well.

33
00:02:49,719 --> 00:02:50,999
I exercise every day.

34
00:02:53,159 --> 00:02:55,040
Mingzhu and Meiqi
also take good care of me.

35
00:02:56,960 --> 00:02:57,760
Where's Meiqi?

36
00:02:57,770 --> 00:02:59,550
She went to the hospital
to get my medicine.

37
00:03:00,770 --> 00:03:01,439
Have some water.

38
00:03:01,679 --> 00:03:02,240
Okay.

39
00:03:03,640 --> 00:03:04,279
Wait.

40
00:03:04,879 --> 00:03:06,999
Minghui made seafood porridge.

41
00:03:07,279 --> 00:03:07,879
Really?

42
00:03:08,599 --> 00:03:09,520
I'll serve you some.

43
00:03:09,520 --> 00:03:09,999
Okay.

44
00:03:12,879 --> 00:03:15,439
Minghui is such a good kid.

45
00:03:16,679 --> 00:03:17,279
Yes.

46
00:03:17,439 --> 00:03:19,159
I was wrong in the past.

47
00:03:19,159 --> 00:03:20,599
Why bring that up?

48
00:03:21,040 --> 00:03:21,879
It's all in the past.

49
00:03:21,879 --> 00:03:23,240
And we're all one family now.

50
00:03:24,040 --> 00:03:24,599
Here.

51
00:03:25,960 --> 00:03:27,719
Minghui was immature before.

52
00:03:28,240 --> 00:03:29,480
Naughty, mischievous.

53
00:03:29,879 --> 00:03:31,520
But now he can stand on his own.

54
00:03:34,719 --> 00:03:35,800
Smells so good.

55
00:03:36,915 --> 00:03:38,240
He cooked it for quite a while.

56
00:03:41,999 --> 00:03:42,839
Drink slowly.

57
00:03:42,839 --> 00:03:43,599
Okay.

58
00:03:44,320 --> 00:03:45,640
Here, Mingzhu, you drink first.

59
00:03:45,640 --> 00:03:46,679
Mom, you drink first.

60
00:03:46,839 --> 00:03:48,559
You drink first. I'll serve her.

61
00:03:49,559 --> 00:03:50,080
Here.

62
00:03:50,480 --> 00:03:50,999
Here.

63
00:03:52,839 --> 00:03:53,480
Okay.

64
00:03:59,839 --> 00:04:00,679
Thank you, Mom.

65
00:04:01,879 --> 00:04:03,159
It might be hot. Drink slowly.

66
00:04:03,159 --> 00:04:03,679
Okay.

67
00:04:08,240 --> 00:04:08,920
It's good.

68
00:04:09,582 --> 00:04:10,520
- Right?
- It's nice.

69
00:04:10,520 --> 00:04:11,080
It's good.

70
00:04:20,760 --> 00:04:21,359
Mom.

71
00:04:26,120 --> 00:04:27,599
I bought you some fruit.

72
00:04:27,839 --> 00:04:29,080
Remember to eat it.

73
00:04:32,120 --> 00:04:33,239
Zhidong left.

74
00:04:40,719 --> 00:04:41,279
Mom.

75
00:04:42,719 --> 00:04:44,000
What you just said,

76
00:04:44,839 --> 00:04:46,640
together with that expression of yours,

77
00:04:47,360 --> 00:04:50,404
anyone who didn't know would think
something happened to my brother.

78
00:04:50,599 --> 00:04:52,640
Xu Zhidong and Bichen

79
00:04:52,640 --> 00:04:55,159
flew away together happily
as a couple, okay?

80
00:05:01,479 --> 00:05:03,320
Zhixia.

81
00:05:04,239 --> 00:05:06,440
My little sweetheart.

82
00:05:08,159 --> 00:05:08,880
Really.

83
00:05:11,200 --> 00:05:11,839
Take a portion

84
00:05:11,839 --> 00:05:13,120
of these wontons with you later.

85
00:05:13,399 --> 00:05:15,080
And bring another portion
to your sister.

86
00:05:15,680 --> 00:05:16,120
By the way,

87
00:05:16,120 --> 00:05:17,640
how's your sister doing lately?

88
00:05:19,839 --> 00:05:20,919
Not great.

89
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:23,279
Why?

90
00:05:23,440 --> 00:05:25,120
She's heavily pregnant,

91
00:05:25,440 --> 00:05:27,520
with a stroke-stricken Mother-in-law
at home,

92
00:05:27,960 --> 00:05:29,880
an unemployed sister-in-law,

93
00:05:30,120 --> 00:05:31,239
and a pile of debt.

94
00:05:31,359 --> 00:05:32,279
What do you think?

95
00:05:32,279 --> 00:05:33,440
She's in deep trouble.

96
00:05:33,520 --> 00:05:34,719
No.

97
00:05:34,719 --> 00:05:37,359
Help her! Give her a hand!

98
00:05:37,359 --> 00:05:38,520
What about...

99
00:05:38,520 --> 00:05:39,640
Her useless mother?

100
00:05:39,640 --> 00:05:41,382
What is she doing?
Why isn't she helping?

101
00:05:41,493 --> 00:05:43,120
Mom, what you said is not right.

102
00:05:43,120 --> 00:05:44,919
What do you mean "useless mother"?

103
00:05:45,440 --> 00:05:45,789
I...

104
00:05:45,790 --> 00:05:47,360
She was the one who wiped poop and pee

105
00:05:47,370 --> 00:05:48,150
and raised Mingzhu.

106
00:05:48,150 --> 00:05:49,626
She's also the one running around

107
00:05:49,648 --> 00:05:51,137
helping Mingzhu through hard times.

108
00:05:51,248 --> 00:05:53,204
How did she become "useless"
in your mouth?

109
00:05:53,320 --> 00:05:55,520
Who exactly is useless,
and who is the real one?

110
00:05:56,159 --> 00:05:57,880
How can you talk like that?

111
00:05:57,880 --> 00:05:59,919
I didn't know your sister's situation.

112
00:05:59,919 --> 00:06:01,279
Now that I know, what?

113
00:06:01,279 --> 00:06:02,760
Haven't I given money and effort?

114
00:06:02,880 --> 00:06:04,560
Wasn't that big bracelet bought by me?

115
00:06:04,560 --> 00:06:05,120
Mom.

116
00:06:05,880 --> 00:06:07,799
We know you treat Mingzhu well.

117
00:06:08,390 --> 00:06:09,604
But no matter how well,

118
00:06:09,648 --> 00:06:11,440
you're just making up for the past,
right?

119
00:06:11,880 --> 00:06:13,399
But the "useless mother" you said

120
00:06:13,399 --> 00:06:14,799
is the one who truly gave.

121
00:06:14,799 --> 00:06:17,120
She gave for over 20 years,
every single day.

122
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:20,839
Xu Zhixia.

123
00:06:22,080 --> 00:06:23,279
Why is your elbow

124
00:06:23,279 --> 00:06:25,279
always pointing outward?

125
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:27,359
You know clearly.

126
00:06:27,359 --> 00:06:28,839
Your grandmother gave the child away.

127
00:06:28,839 --> 00:06:30,640
I didn't know at the time!

128
00:06:30,640 --> 00:06:32,200
You can't use every little thing

129
00:06:32,200 --> 00:06:34,000
to provoke me like this.

130
00:06:34,200 --> 00:06:35,239
In your opinion, why does

131
00:06:35,239 --> 00:06:36,839
that Yue Xiu'e become a fairy?

132
00:06:37,599 --> 00:06:38,880
She's a scammer!

133
00:06:39,200 --> 00:06:40,320
She's a bandit!

134
00:06:40,560 --> 00:06:41,919
She took my child away

135
00:06:41,919 --> 00:06:42,960
and then ran off!

136
00:06:44,599 --> 00:06:46,239
If you talk like that, I won't be happy.

137
00:06:46,479 --> 00:06:48,359
How am I "turning my elbow outward"?

138
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:51,159
I'm just telling the truth, okay?

139
00:06:51,710 --> 00:06:52,715
If there's anything,

140
00:06:52,760 --> 00:06:54,230
can't we sit down and talk calmly?

141
00:06:54,239 --> 00:06:56,159
I already argue nonstop
with Zhang Hao at home.

142
00:06:56,159 --> 00:06:58,159
I don't want to come here
and argue with you.

143
00:06:58,919 --> 00:07:00,719
Mingzhu is tired. Me too.

144
00:07:01,399 --> 00:07:02,919
Am I not your biological daughter?

145
00:07:04,200 --> 00:07:05,239
Alright, you...

146
00:07:08,440 --> 00:07:09,680
Come here, Zhixia.

147
00:07:11,039 --> 00:07:11,560
I...

148
00:07:12,799 --> 00:07:15,719
You came all the way to argue with me.

149
00:07:16,239 --> 00:07:16,760
I...

150
00:07:19,359 --> 00:07:21,520
I'm sorry. I was wrong.

151
00:07:23,760 --> 00:07:24,359
Mom.

152
00:07:24,839 --> 00:07:26,000
What I mean is...

153
00:07:27,399 --> 00:07:29,520
Let the past stay in the past.

154
00:07:29,520 --> 00:07:30,080
Alright?

155
00:07:30,479 --> 00:07:33,159
Let's stop bringing up old issues.

156
00:07:33,479 --> 00:07:34,880
No matter who's right or wrong,

157
00:07:34,880 --> 00:07:36,839
no matter who's "real" or "fake",

158
00:07:37,279 --> 00:07:38,239
none of that matters.

159
00:07:38,239 --> 00:07:39,399
It's all in the past, okay?

160
00:07:39,640 --> 00:07:40,440
Right now,

161
00:07:40,599 --> 00:07:42,200
if we have money, time, or energy,

162
00:07:42,359 --> 00:07:44,159
we should help Mingzhu however we can.

163
00:07:44,159 --> 00:07:45,640
Mingzhu is having a hard time.

164
00:07:45,719 --> 00:07:46,680
Maybe soon

165
00:07:46,680 --> 00:07:48,039
she won't even have a job.

166
00:07:55,520 --> 00:07:56,440
Morning, Mr. Zhao.

167
00:07:58,000 --> 00:07:58,640
Mingzhu.

168
00:07:58,693 --> 00:08:00,560
I already told you,
there's nothing I can do.

169
00:08:00,560 --> 00:08:01,604
Why did you come again?

170
00:08:03,080 --> 00:08:03,680
Look.

171
00:08:03,919 --> 00:08:05,760
These are freshly steamed
Jinling meat buns.

172
00:08:05,760 --> 00:08:06,560
They're delicious!

173
00:08:06,560 --> 00:08:07,159
Try one.

174
00:08:07,159 --> 00:08:09,200
I queued for so long to buy them.

175
00:08:09,839 --> 00:08:10,640
Right now,

176
00:08:10,640 --> 00:08:12,320
even if you brought me
Jinling meat buns

177
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:14,599
or even human-flesh char siu buns,

178
00:08:14,599 --> 00:08:16,210
I still can't arrange
a position for you.

179
00:08:16,220 --> 00:08:17,520
You must have a way.

180
00:08:18,080 --> 00:08:19,440
Please help me think again.

181
00:08:19,680 --> 00:08:21,159
How can I stay?

182
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:24,000
There's no way.

183
00:08:24,479 --> 00:08:25,799
Not even a little?

184
00:08:26,479 --> 00:08:27,120
None.

185
00:08:29,120 --> 00:08:31,159
Unless you really have the ability

186
00:08:31,239 --> 00:08:32,800
to take over the entire F&B department

187
00:08:32,800 --> 00:08:33,839
of our hotel.

188
00:08:34,359 --> 00:08:35,560
If you really can do it well,

189
00:08:35,639 --> 00:08:37,200
you'd earn way more than working here.

190
00:08:40,060 --> 00:08:41,720
What are the requirements
to contract it?

191
00:08:41,737 --> 00:08:43,182
Annual payment of 300,000 yuan.

192
00:08:43,960 --> 00:08:44,839
Paid in advance.

193
00:08:48,599 --> 00:08:50,239
How's it? 300,000 yuan.

194
00:08:51,080 --> 00:08:51,680
Do you have it?

195
00:08:52,560 --> 00:08:53,800
I don't even have 30,000 yuan.

196
00:08:55,960 --> 00:08:56,960
So,

197
00:08:57,200 --> 00:08:58,999
just stay home and rest.

198
00:08:59,440 --> 00:09:00,639
You're a girl.

199
00:09:00,839 --> 00:09:01,759
Why make life so hard?

200
00:09:01,848 --> 00:09:02,990
I'm going out for a while.

201
00:09:05,759 --> 00:09:06,639
Thanks for the buns.

202
00:09:06,710 --> 00:09:08,048
I just happened to skip breakfast.

203
00:09:08,093 --> 00:09:09,226
Sit here yourself.

204
00:09:11,920 --> 00:09:12,440
Mom.

205
00:09:12,440 --> 00:09:14,280
This is a new skill I learned.

206
00:09:14,680 --> 00:09:16,200
You know, just this process alone

207
00:09:16,200 --> 00:09:18,599
costs 280 yuan for a single session
at the rehab center.

208
00:09:19,200 --> 00:09:20,440
So I'm saving money.

209
00:09:20,440 --> 00:09:21,359
Exactly.

210
00:09:22,759 --> 00:09:23,599
Meiqi.

211
00:09:25,719 --> 00:09:26,999
I have been dragging you down.

212
00:09:28,999 --> 00:09:30,680
So you need to get better quickly.

213
00:09:30,680 --> 00:09:32,719
Yes, I'll try hard.

214
00:09:32,719 --> 00:09:34,680
Look at me, I can do this...

215
00:09:34,760 --> 00:09:36,040
I'll do this for you every day.

216
00:09:36,040 --> 00:09:36,920
I'm back.

217
00:09:37,239 --> 00:09:38,200
Mingzhu is back.

218
00:09:38,200 --> 00:09:39,582
- Mingzhu.
- Rest for a while.

219
00:09:39,719 --> 00:09:40,680
How is it, Mingzhu?

220
00:09:42,719 --> 00:09:44,479
There's some unrealistic good news.

221
00:09:45,200 --> 00:09:46,071
The F&B department

222
00:09:46,071 --> 00:09:48,115
of Nanxi Hotel might let me
take the contract.

223
00:09:49,080 --> 00:09:49,719
But...

224
00:09:50,479 --> 00:09:51,719
It costs 300,000 yuan a year.

225
00:09:56,119 --> 00:09:57,280
Indeed unrealistic.

226
00:09:58,080 --> 00:09:59,479
Mingzhu is just cheering us up.

227
00:10:00,040 --> 00:10:00,800
Here I come.

228
00:10:01,839 --> 00:10:03,080
- Mrs. Feng is here.
- Auntie.

229
00:10:03,440 --> 00:10:05,080
Mom, why did you come again?

230
00:10:05,115 --> 00:10:06,590
A restaurant can't be left unattended.

231
00:10:06,848 --> 00:10:08,750
Why would you say that?
Your dad's not a person?

232
00:10:08,830 --> 00:10:10,071
Your brother's not a person?

233
00:10:10,599 --> 00:10:11,560
Give it to me.

234
00:10:12,359 --> 00:10:13,680
I saw a super fresh

235
00:10:13,839 --> 00:10:15,839
free-range chicken

236
00:10:15,839 --> 00:10:16,839
at the market today.

237
00:10:16,839 --> 00:10:18,280
I'd come cook it for you.

238
00:10:18,599 --> 00:10:19,920
Thanks, Mrs. Shen.

239
00:10:19,982 --> 00:10:20,680
Thanks for what?

240
00:10:20,680 --> 00:10:22,920
You're all weak and recovering.
You need to eat well.

241
00:10:23,160 --> 00:10:24,280
Recover sooner.

242
00:10:24,599 --> 00:10:26,320
Okay, thank you.

243
00:10:27,280 --> 00:10:28,160
Mom, put it there.

244
00:10:28,160 --> 00:10:29,359
Put it down. I'll do it.

245
00:10:29,359 --> 00:10:31,040
- Don't touch it.
- I'll handle it myself.

246
00:10:31,040 --> 00:10:32,080
You're just making a mess.

247
00:10:32,080 --> 00:10:32,960
Go rest.

248
00:10:33,320 --> 00:10:34,719
You're not helping. Hurry.

249
00:10:35,440 --> 00:10:36,119
Mrs. Shen.

250
00:10:36,671 --> 00:10:37,800
Thank you for your hard work.

251
00:10:38,080 --> 00:10:39,040
Stop saying that.

252
00:10:39,239 --> 00:10:40,440
If you're worried about me,

253
00:10:40,560 --> 00:10:42,119
then recover quickly.

254
00:10:42,119 --> 00:10:43,560
Later I'll teach you and you can cook.

255
00:10:43,560 --> 00:10:44,239
I won't learn.

256
00:10:45,280 --> 00:10:46,680
It tastes better when you cook.

257
00:10:47,320 --> 00:10:47,879
You're lazy.

258
00:10:50,100 --> 00:10:53,159
(Xin City Grand Court)

259
00:10:53,160 --> 00:10:53,879
Here, right?

260
00:10:54,119 --> 00:10:54,719
Yes.

261
00:10:55,599 --> 00:10:57,800
When have I ever walked this far?

262
00:10:58,639 --> 00:10:59,400
Young man,

263
00:10:59,400 --> 00:11:00,719
open the door for me.

264
00:11:01,080 --> 00:11:02,479
Auntie, who are you looking for?

265
00:11:02,719 --> 00:11:03,839
I'm looking for Shen Mingzhu.

266
00:11:03,999 --> 00:11:04,879
I'm her mother.

267
00:11:05,519 --> 00:11:06,320
I'm her father.

268
00:11:08,519 --> 00:11:09,999
How many Moms are there?

269
00:11:09,999 --> 00:11:11,160
Don't worry about that.

270
00:11:11,200 --> 00:11:12,320
I'm her real mom.

271
00:11:12,359 --> 00:11:13,519
Open the door.

272
00:11:13,999 --> 00:11:14,639
Mrs. Feng.

273
00:11:15,160 --> 00:11:16,960
Be careful when chopping
the chicken later.

274
00:11:16,960 --> 00:11:18,040
Our kitchen knife

275
00:11:18,040 --> 00:11:19,709
isn't very good. Don't cut your hand.

276
00:11:19,710 --> 00:11:21,137
- Don't worry.
- Who is it?

277
00:11:21,137 --> 00:11:21,604
I...

278
00:11:22,080 --> 00:11:22,719
I'll go.

279
00:11:23,582 --> 00:11:24,920
- Did you order food?
- Coming!

280
00:11:25,040 --> 00:11:25,719
No.

281
00:11:27,999 --> 00:11:29,359
Uncle, Auntie.

282
00:11:29,359 --> 00:11:30,040
You...

283
00:11:30,599 --> 00:11:31,920
We came to see Mingzhu.

284
00:11:32,960 --> 00:11:33,839
Come in.

285
00:11:33,839 --> 00:11:34,320
Mingzhu.

286
00:11:34,320 --> 00:11:34,960
Okay, come in.

287
00:11:35,280 --> 00:11:37,359
The security downstairs
swipes the card for us.

288
00:11:37,759 --> 00:11:38,359
Mingzhu.

289
00:11:40,060 --> 00:11:41,404
- We can't...
- Why are you here?

290
00:11:41,404 --> 00:11:42,750
Mingzhu's real parents.

291
00:11:44,160 --> 00:11:44,920
Let's change shoes.

292
00:11:44,920 --> 00:11:46,626
No need.

293
00:11:47,040 --> 00:11:47,639
We...

294
00:11:48,239 --> 00:11:49,759
This is my mother-in-law.

295
00:11:50,719 --> 00:11:51,560
Hello, Mrs. Feng.

296
00:11:51,759 --> 00:11:52,680
Hello.

297
00:11:53,239 --> 00:11:54,599
Um, excuse me.

298
00:11:54,599 --> 00:11:55,719
My leg...

299
00:11:55,879 --> 00:11:57,080
No, don't get up.

300
00:11:57,080 --> 00:11:57,599
You sit.

301
00:11:57,599 --> 00:11:58,680
Sit.

302
00:11:58,680 --> 00:11:59,719
Please have a seat.

303
00:11:59,719 --> 00:12:00,800
Mingzhu, pour some water.

304
00:12:03,280 --> 00:12:03,879
Well...

305
00:12:04,519 --> 00:12:06,839
Mrs. Shen, you're here too.

306
00:12:07,239 --> 00:12:08,200
How are you?

307
00:12:08,800 --> 00:12:10,680
I fart really well.

308
00:12:14,800 --> 00:12:15,999
Fart really well.

309
00:12:16,160 --> 00:12:18,480
That's because of strong lungs.

310
00:12:18,490 --> 00:12:20,479
Yes, the healthier you are,
the louder the fart.

311
00:12:20,479 --> 00:12:21,280
Yes.

312
00:12:21,280 --> 00:12:21,759
Right.

313
00:12:22,119 --> 00:12:24,200
Alright, Mrs. Shen.
Stop busying yourself.

314
00:12:24,200 --> 00:12:24,680
I'll do it.

315
00:12:24,680 --> 00:12:25,610
- It's chopped.
- Yes.

316
00:12:25,620 --> 00:12:25,982
Okay.

317
00:12:25,999 --> 00:12:27,119
I'll do it.

318
00:12:27,119 --> 00:12:28,680
Here, don't chop it yet.

319
00:12:28,680 --> 00:12:30,879
No. Why are you here?

320
00:12:31,359 --> 00:12:33,359
No, your chicken is whole.

321
00:12:33,359 --> 00:12:35,119
The one I bought...

322
00:12:35,560 --> 00:12:38,359
Look, I had the supermarket chop it.

323
00:12:38,839 --> 00:12:40,160
Mine is free-range chicken.

324
00:12:40,400 --> 00:12:41,839
Mine is also free-range chicken.

325
00:12:46,639 --> 00:12:47,160
Well...

326
00:12:47,239 --> 00:12:48,479
Both of you go rest.

327
00:12:48,560 --> 00:12:49,160
I'll handle it.

328
00:12:49,160 --> 00:12:50,080
- No need.
- No need.

329
00:12:50,759 --> 00:12:51,519
Mingzhu.

330
00:12:52,320 --> 00:12:52,920
Go rest.

331
00:12:52,920 --> 00:12:53,999
Listen to your mother-in-law.

332
00:12:53,999 --> 00:12:54,879
Yes, go.

333
00:12:54,879 --> 00:12:55,440
You...

334
00:12:55,440 --> 00:12:55,999
Well...

335
00:12:56,639 --> 00:12:57,960
Mrs. Shen, you usually

336
00:12:57,960 --> 00:12:59,719
work hard taking care of them.

337
00:12:59,999 --> 00:13:02,680
Today, please have a rest.

338
00:13:02,680 --> 00:13:03,320
I'll do it.

339
00:13:03,560 --> 00:13:04,560
You enjoy yourself.

340
00:13:04,560 --> 00:13:05,759
Let me serve you all.

341
00:13:07,200 --> 00:13:09,800
Give this to me.

342
00:13:09,800 --> 00:13:10,400
The apron.

343
00:13:14,599 --> 00:13:15,400
Okay, thanks.

344
00:13:17,400 --> 00:13:18,080
Mrs. Shen.

345
00:13:18,680 --> 00:13:20,200
Come, sit here.

346
00:13:22,280 --> 00:13:22,879
Dacheng.

347
00:13:23,239 --> 00:13:24,920
Don't just stand there in a daze.

348
00:13:24,920 --> 00:13:25,359
Coming.

349
00:13:25,359 --> 00:13:26,519
Take it out.

350
00:13:26,999 --> 00:13:27,920
There's more.

351
00:13:27,920 --> 00:13:29,160
Why did you buy so many groceries?

352
00:13:29,160 --> 00:13:31,040
Yeah, we came to bring you groceries,

353
00:13:31,040 --> 00:13:31,879
you know?

354
00:13:31,960 --> 00:13:33,200
To nourish your body.

355
00:13:33,200 --> 00:13:34,519
Yes, nourish your body.

356
00:13:37,115 --> 00:13:37,960
Making stewed chicken.

357
00:13:37,999 --> 00:13:38,879
Got the floor dirty.

358
00:13:39,080 --> 00:13:40,239
It's okay.

359
00:13:40,759 --> 00:13:41,359
No problem.

360
00:13:42,560 --> 00:13:43,519
Xiang, look.

361
00:13:44,479 --> 00:13:45,239
It's big.

362
00:13:45,479 --> 00:13:46,119
Yeah.

363
00:13:46,440 --> 00:13:47,960
Looks like a boy.

364
00:13:48,440 --> 00:13:49,320
Definitely a boy.

365
00:13:49,320 --> 00:13:49,879
Yes.

366
00:13:49,879 --> 00:13:51,280
But I like girls.

367
00:13:51,280 --> 00:13:52,119
Both are good.

368
00:13:52,200 --> 00:13:52,920
Yes.

369
00:13:52,920 --> 00:13:54,604
- Both are good.
- Both are the same.

370
00:13:54,700 --> 00:13:56,422
(No. 68, Wenzhong Avenue, Xidi Road,)

371
00:13:56,440 --> 00:13:58,515
(Old Town District, Nanzhou City.
March 26, 1994)

372
00:14:08,040 --> 00:14:09,680
How are you? You're doing well.

373
00:14:10,200 --> 00:14:11,359
Good, all good.

374
00:14:11,599 --> 00:14:12,479
Good.

375
00:14:12,839 --> 00:14:14,639
Don't stand here. Go quickly.

376
00:14:14,639 --> 00:14:16,239
Go be with your mother-in-law.

377
00:14:16,239 --> 00:14:17,479
Yes, go rest.

378
00:14:17,479 --> 00:14:18,479
We'll do things here.

379
00:14:18,479 --> 00:14:19,400
Come, Mingzhu.

380
00:14:19,800 --> 00:14:20,519
Come rest a bit.

381
00:14:20,759 --> 00:14:22,560
- Go.
- Have a rest.

382
00:14:35,800 --> 00:14:39,839
A mother teaches her son
to serve the country.

383
00:14:40,719 --> 00:14:43,879
With unwavering loyalty.

384
00:14:43,879 --> 00:14:46,080
A mother teaches her son

385
00:14:47,160 --> 00:14:49,200
to honor his parents.

386
00:14:50,080 --> 00:14:52,800
To be

387
00:14:53,479 --> 00:14:56,200
a dutiful and loyal man.

388
00:14:56,440 --> 00:14:59,519
Now that I have become an official.

389
00:15:00,080 --> 00:15:07,280
My mother cannot see it.

390
00:15:21,879 --> 00:15:26,920
- Oh Mother.
- Oh Mother.

391
00:15:28,320 --> 00:15:29,999
What have you been doing lately?

392
00:15:31,239 --> 00:15:33,239
Going around rewinding

393
00:15:33,479 --> 00:15:35,080
this old recorder nonstop.

394
00:15:35,320 --> 00:15:36,479
What recorder?

395
00:15:37,830 --> 00:15:39,004
This is an old cassette.

396
00:15:39,719 --> 00:15:40,560
"Zhu Hen Ji".

397
00:15:40,660 --> 00:15:42,160
You still remember this opera, right?

398
00:15:42,200 --> 00:15:43,400
The part at the grave mound.

399
00:15:44,719 --> 00:15:45,440
It's strange.

400
00:15:45,440 --> 00:15:46,960
These past couple of days,

401
00:15:47,893 --> 00:15:49,937
I can't stop thinking about this part.

402
00:15:50,239 --> 00:15:51,280
It won't leave my mind.

403
00:15:52,599 --> 00:15:56,359
They say when you get old,
you start thinking about the past.

404
00:15:56,999 --> 00:15:59,440
You're getting older and missing home.

405
00:15:59,920 --> 00:16:01,648
It's hard to leave our homeland.

406
00:16:02,119 --> 00:16:03,759
In a blink, we've been in the south

407
00:16:04,479 --> 00:16:05,759
for almost 30 years.

408
00:16:07,519 --> 00:16:08,879
Over 30 years...

409
00:16:09,599 --> 00:16:11,040
Our daughter is thirty now.

410
00:16:12,440 --> 00:16:13,080
The other day,

411
00:16:13,360 --> 00:16:15,982
do you remember that customer
ordered sweet and sour pork?

412
00:16:16,359 --> 00:16:17,839
I said, what's so hard about it?

413
00:16:19,440 --> 00:16:20,759
But when I made it,

414
00:16:21,599 --> 00:16:23,839
I just felt it wasn't quite the same.

415
00:16:24,680 --> 00:16:26,719
We've been making braised pork chops

416
00:16:28,239 --> 00:16:29,999
and forgotten the taste of home.

417
00:16:30,879 --> 00:16:31,519
Honey.

418
00:16:32,999 --> 00:16:33,839
Honestly,

419
00:16:35,680 --> 00:16:37,960
all these years we've gone from
a small shop

420
00:16:38,239 --> 00:16:39,680
to now this

421
00:16:40,719 --> 00:16:41,960
big restaurant.

422
00:16:45,440 --> 00:16:46,426
It hasn't been easy.

423
00:16:47,920 --> 00:16:49,359
I'm really grateful to you.

424
00:16:49,839 --> 00:16:51,160
Grateful to me for what?

425
00:16:51,160 --> 00:16:52,800
Without you, could I have done it?

426
00:16:53,200 --> 00:16:54,271
No matter how capable I am,

427
00:16:54,519 --> 00:16:55,920
I couldn't have done it alone.

428
00:16:56,280 --> 00:16:56,800
Forget it.

429
00:16:56,800 --> 00:16:58,400
Without you, I can't do anything.

430
00:16:59,999 --> 00:17:02,200
You see, any difficult thing for us,

431
00:17:02,599 --> 00:17:03,160
right?

432
00:17:03,519 --> 00:17:04,319
Once we talk,

433
00:17:05,039 --> 00:17:06,999
it never lasts overnight.

434
00:17:07,400 --> 00:17:07,999
Right?

435
00:17:08,400 --> 00:17:09,079
You are

436
00:17:09,079 --> 00:17:10,920
sometimes nagging,

437
00:17:11,360 --> 00:17:13,880
but what you say is always practical.

438
00:17:13,999 --> 00:17:15,759
Never deceived me or lied to me.

439
00:17:16,680 --> 00:17:17,360
You see,

440
00:17:17,360 --> 00:17:19,319
our life is just harmonious and happy.

441
00:17:20,640 --> 00:17:22,479
We just live our life this way.

442
00:17:26,120 --> 00:17:26,880
I just think...

443
00:17:28,719 --> 00:17:29,640
When will we

444
00:17:33,079 --> 00:17:34,279
pass it on to the kids?

445
00:17:36,848 --> 00:17:38,204
Like leaves returning to roots.

446
00:17:38,204 --> 00:17:39,671
Sometimes I really want to go home.

447
00:17:40,200 --> 00:17:42,519
What about the kids?

448
00:17:42,880 --> 00:17:45,039
Kids? What's there to worry about?

449
00:17:45,960 --> 00:17:48,029
Mingzhu helps Minghui.

450
00:17:48,030 --> 00:17:49,915
Minghui can handle things
on his own now.

451
00:17:50,079 --> 00:17:52,719
He can flip woks and cook dishes
by himself.

452
00:17:53,239 --> 00:17:54,600
Once Mingzhu joins,

453
00:17:54,719 --> 00:17:56,039
the two of them

454
00:17:56,071 --> 00:17:58,160
will surely run the restaurant
better than we do.

455
00:17:59,880 --> 00:18:01,239
Why are you crying?

456
00:18:01,239 --> 00:18:01,960
Shen.

457
00:18:05,200 --> 00:18:06,440
What's this about?

458
00:18:06,840 --> 00:18:07,680
There's something

459
00:18:09,319 --> 00:18:10,440
I've wronged you,

460
00:18:10,440 --> 00:18:11,680
and wronged Mingzhu.

461
00:18:15,200 --> 00:18:17,079
What the heck are you talking about?

462
00:18:19,500 --> 00:18:22,277
(No. 68, Wenzhong Avenue, Xidi Road,)

463
00:18:22,301 --> 00:18:24,820
(Old Town District, Nanzhou City.
March 26, 1994)

464
00:18:27,999 --> 00:18:28,840
I'm sorry.

465
00:18:36,120 --> 00:18:36,519
Dad.

466
00:18:36,799 --> 00:18:38,239
Your mom has something to tell you.

467
00:18:40,719 --> 00:18:41,120
Sit here.

468
00:18:42,360 --> 00:18:42,960
Well...

469
00:18:43,840 --> 00:18:45,680
You sit here.

470
00:18:46,200 --> 00:18:46,840
I'll sit here?

471
00:18:46,840 --> 00:18:47,759
You just sit here.

472
00:18:49,799 --> 00:18:50,640
About what?

473
00:18:51,759 --> 00:18:52,479
Go ahead.

474
00:18:53,440 --> 00:18:54,319
Tired?

475
00:18:55,319 --> 00:18:55,999
Not tired.

476
00:18:57,750 --> 00:18:58,937
There's been something

477
00:18:59,880 --> 00:19:02,840
on her mind all these years.

478
00:19:03,400 --> 00:19:04,680
It's been 30 years.

479
00:19:06,680 --> 00:19:07,279
She...

480
00:19:09,600 --> 00:19:10,960
Just speak. Don't make me say it.

481
00:19:10,960 --> 00:19:12,799
I'm so clumsy with words.

482
00:19:14,640 --> 00:19:15,239
It's just...

483
00:19:17,160 --> 00:19:19,120
Do you remember that day at the market,

484
00:19:20,079 --> 00:19:23,120
your birth mother and I

485
00:19:24,519 --> 00:19:25,279
had an argument?

486
00:19:25,279 --> 00:19:26,999
You asked me something.

487
00:19:26,999 --> 00:19:30,120
You asked if there was a note...

488
00:19:32,319 --> 00:19:35,039
You know, from the day
we brought you home,

489
00:19:35,039 --> 00:19:36,840
your dad and I never felt

490
00:19:36,840 --> 00:19:38,293
that you were someone else's child.

491
00:19:38,337 --> 00:19:38,804
Yes.

492
00:19:38,960 --> 00:19:41,479
We just felt you and Minghui
were both ours.

493
00:19:42,479 --> 00:19:43,120
However...

494
00:19:45,840 --> 00:19:46,799
The note

495
00:19:48,319 --> 00:19:48,960
exists.

496
00:19:50,880 --> 00:19:52,479
I didn't tell you the truth.

497
00:19:59,080 --> 00:20:00,861
(No. 68, Wenzhong Avenue, Xidi Road,)

498
00:20:00,885 --> 00:20:03,000
(Old Town District, Nanzhou City.
March 26, 1994)

499
00:20:03,479 --> 00:20:05,239
Actually, I didn't know
about this either.

500
00:20:06,479 --> 00:20:07,640
I just found out too.

501
00:20:07,920 --> 00:20:09,519
Yes, it's all my fault, really.

502
00:20:10,120 --> 00:20:10,920
It's me.

503
00:20:11,920 --> 00:20:13,120
Back then, I just...

504
00:20:13,479 --> 00:20:14,799
When your maternal grandmother

505
00:20:14,799 --> 00:20:16,200
brought you here...

506
00:20:16,200 --> 00:20:17,799
They had given birth to twins.

507
00:20:17,920 --> 00:20:19,239
She kept the boy,

508
00:20:19,239 --> 00:20:20,960
and gave away the girl.

509
00:20:20,960 --> 00:20:23,559
Those were especially difficult years.

510
00:20:23,559 --> 00:20:25,840
I also thought about sending you back.

511
00:20:25,840 --> 00:20:27,239
Later, I thought that their family

512
00:20:27,515 --> 00:20:29,160
must have been very son-preferential.

513
00:20:29,160 --> 00:20:30,671
I was afraid that if you went there,

514
00:20:31,479 --> 00:20:32,200
you would suffer.

515
00:20:33,479 --> 00:20:36,440
So I thought I'd wait for some time.

516
00:20:37,319 --> 00:20:38,719
Time really passes so fast.

517
00:20:38,719 --> 00:20:39,840
In the blink of an eye,

518
00:20:40,640 --> 00:20:41,640
you're...

519
00:20:42,079 --> 00:20:42,840
Becoming a Mother.

520
00:20:42,840 --> 00:20:44,640
You're almost a Mother now.

521
00:20:45,079 --> 00:20:46,840
The further I get, the more

522
00:20:48,319 --> 00:20:48,960
I don't dare.

523
00:20:50,640 --> 00:20:52,840
I'm just afraid

524
00:20:53,640 --> 00:20:56,039
that after hiding this from you
for so many years,

525
00:20:57,400 --> 00:21:00,160
if you got angry and went to find them,

526
00:21:00,160 --> 00:21:02,200
we would really

527
00:21:03,120 --> 00:21:03,960
lose you.

528
00:21:03,960 --> 00:21:05,680
That's what I was really afraid of.

529
00:21:06,999 --> 00:21:08,160
- Mom.
- Sorry, my daughter.

530
00:21:08,319 --> 00:21:09,559
Don't say that.

531
00:21:10,840 --> 00:21:13,239
I know how you treated me growing up.

532
00:21:14,880 --> 00:21:16,559
Even though you adopted me,

533
00:21:17,440 --> 00:21:19,120
I have everything Minghui has,

534
00:21:19,515 --> 00:21:21,360
and I even have
what Minghui doesn't have.

535
00:21:21,920 --> 00:21:23,039
I know how you treated me.

536
00:21:23,239 --> 00:21:24,559
I've always known.

537
00:21:24,920 --> 00:21:27,200
I've always considered you
my real parents.

538
00:21:29,559 --> 00:21:30,600
Without you,

539
00:21:30,840 --> 00:21:33,079
I wouldn't be the Shen Mingzhu
I am today.

540
00:21:35,400 --> 00:21:37,960
Actually, this matter...

541
00:21:38,893 --> 00:21:39,982
I hadn't thought it through.

542
00:21:40,048 --> 00:21:41,750
Now we've also figured it out.

543
00:21:42,680 --> 00:21:43,400
You see, we...

544
00:21:44,440 --> 00:21:45,200
For what purpose?

545
00:21:45,200 --> 00:21:47,039
Wasn't it just
to make sure you live well?

546
00:21:47,960 --> 00:21:50,920
You'd have an extra Mom and Dad
to take care of you.

547
00:21:50,920 --> 00:21:51,680
Isn't that great?

548
00:21:52,680 --> 00:21:54,680
If we get sick or disaster strikes,

549
00:21:54,680 --> 00:21:56,559
when we're gone, you'd still have

550
00:21:56,582 --> 00:21:58,826
someone to take care of you.
Isn't that a good thing?

551
00:21:59,519 --> 00:21:59,999
So...

552
00:21:59,999 --> 00:22:00,920
Your mom...

553
00:22:00,920 --> 00:22:02,360
Whenever your mom speaks...

554
00:22:02,799 --> 00:22:04,719
Who could get sick or a disaster strike?

555
00:22:04,920 --> 00:22:07,079
No one can live forever, right?

556
00:22:07,279 --> 00:22:07,920
Right?

557
00:22:08,400 --> 00:22:09,559
Don't say that.

558
00:22:09,719 --> 00:22:10,400
Mingzhu.

559
00:22:11,120 --> 00:22:14,680
As long as you live well,

560
00:22:15,920 --> 00:22:16,719
we can accept

561
00:22:18,239 --> 00:22:19,479
any love.

562
00:22:19,479 --> 00:22:20,719
Yes. The more, the better.

563
00:22:21,079 --> 00:22:22,479
We just hope you're happy.

564
00:22:23,719 --> 00:22:25,719
If you're happy, we're happy.

565
00:22:26,440 --> 00:22:27,160
Dad, Mom.

566
00:22:28,840 --> 00:22:30,440
You will always be my parents.

567
00:22:32,719 --> 00:22:33,960
You two can't escape now.

568
00:22:38,799 --> 00:22:40,400
I told your dad today,

569
00:22:40,440 --> 00:22:41,799
that no one is allowed to cry.

570
00:22:41,799 --> 00:22:43,640
Whoever cries gets
a brain puncture. See?

571
00:22:45,759 --> 00:22:47,400
He's the one getting the puncture.

572
00:22:47,440 --> 00:22:47,999
I am.

573
00:22:49,440 --> 00:22:51,079
Alright, stop crying, Mom.

(Home Harmony Brings Prosperity)

575
00:22:55,400 --> 00:22:56,239
Let me introduce.

576
00:22:56,360 --> 00:22:58,200
This is my sister-in-law, Feng Meiqi.

577
00:22:58,200 --> 00:22:58,960
Hello, Mr. Zhao.

578
00:22:58,960 --> 00:22:59,799
Hello.

579
00:23:00,319 --> 00:23:00,920
Mr. Zhao.

580
00:23:01,160 --> 00:23:02,360
Today, we came

581
00:23:02,479 --> 00:23:03,840
to talk to you

582
00:23:03,920 --> 00:23:05,893
about the restaurant management rights.

583
00:23:06,559 --> 00:23:07,920
300,000 yuan per year...

584
00:23:08,200 --> 00:23:09,799
It's really difficult for us.

585
00:23:10,319 --> 00:23:11,719
Can we switch to a monthly payment?

586
00:23:12,600 --> 00:23:13,239
Mingzhu.

587
00:23:13,440 --> 00:23:13,960
I think...

588
00:23:13,960 --> 00:23:15,239
Let me finish first.

589
00:23:15,400 --> 00:23:18,440
As you see,
the restaurant is currently closed.

590
00:23:18,799 --> 00:23:20,360
The hotel isn't making any money.

591
00:23:20,360 --> 00:23:22,004
The equipment is still deteriorating.

592
00:23:22,360 --> 00:23:23,719
If we take over,

593
00:23:23,759 --> 00:23:25,519
we'll do some minor renovations first,

594
00:23:25,519 --> 00:23:27,039
and eliminate safety hazards.

595
00:23:27,115 --> 00:23:28,619
As for those old pieces of equipment,

596
00:23:28,620 --> 00:23:30,204
repair and replace what needs repairing.

597
00:23:30,204 --> 00:23:31,680
That way, it'll come back to life.

598
00:23:32,120 --> 00:23:33,360
As long as we make money,

599
00:23:33,440 --> 00:23:35,640
we'll definitely pay
the remaining balance immediately.

600
00:23:38,440 --> 00:23:39,120
Mingzhu.

601
00:23:40,120 --> 00:23:42,479
Making money really isn't that simple.

602
00:23:43,079 --> 00:23:44,039
I know it's hard,

603
00:23:44,840 --> 00:23:45,960
but I want to try.

604
00:23:46,920 --> 00:23:48,999
Even if we can't manage after
a few months,

605
00:23:49,239 --> 00:23:50,799
you won't really suffer any loss.

606
00:23:51,120 --> 00:23:52,600
At least you'll be left

607
00:23:52,600 --> 00:23:54,471
with a restaurant ready
to operate anytime.

608
00:23:54,719 --> 00:23:55,479
What do you think?

609
00:23:57,239 --> 00:23:58,440
What you said is all true.

610
00:23:59,360 --> 00:24:00,719
I can also understand how you feel.

611
00:24:01,160 --> 00:24:03,279
But the risks involved

612
00:24:03,719 --> 00:24:05,200
really need careful consideration.

613
00:24:09,200 --> 00:24:09,880
Mr. Zhao.

614
00:24:11,279 --> 00:24:12,759
I studied marketing.

615
00:24:12,999 --> 00:24:14,160
I made a model.

616
00:24:15,239 --> 00:24:17,279
According to our operational concept,

617
00:24:17,279 --> 00:24:18,759
basically, by the seventh month,

618
00:24:18,759 --> 00:24:20,759
we can recoup costs
and start making a profit.

619
00:24:20,920 --> 00:24:22,640
Here's the curve chart.
Please take a look.

(Nanxi Hotel Profit and Loss

621
00:24:29,893 --> 00:24:30,871
It really looks like

622
00:24:31,071 --> 00:24:32,937
that you've done quite
a bit of preparation.

623
00:24:32,960 --> 00:24:35,559
Look. Our family has run a restaurant
for so many years,

624
00:24:35,759 --> 00:24:37,279
and raised me and my brother so well.

625
00:24:37,279 --> 00:24:38,319
What does that show?

626
00:24:38,719 --> 00:24:39,960
It shows that we are

627
00:24:39,960 --> 00:24:42,360
a family business with rich experience.

628
00:24:49,448 --> 00:24:50,960
Three months' advance payment.

629
00:24:51,680 --> 00:24:52,600
Can't be any less.

630
00:24:53,120 --> 00:24:55,079
I'll help you negotiate
with the higher-ups.

631
00:24:55,079 --> 00:24:56,719
Alright, thank you, Mr. Zhao.

632
00:24:56,719 --> 00:24:57,360
No problem.

633
00:24:57,360 --> 00:24:58,937
Next time, you treat others to a meal,

634
00:24:58,982 --> 00:24:59,960
we'll cover it all.

635
00:25:00,640 --> 00:25:01,999
We'll talk about the future later.

636
00:25:02,120 --> 00:25:03,360
But if it really works out,

637
00:25:03,670 --> 00:25:05,137
thanks in advance to you, Ms. Shen.

638
00:25:07,120 --> 00:25:08,519
Mingzhu, you're amazing.

639
00:25:08,737 --> 00:25:10,230
You actually managed to negotiate it.

640
00:25:10,600 --> 00:25:12,840
How would you know unless you tried?

641
00:25:15,200 --> 00:25:18,640
Three months in advance...
Nearly 75,000 yuan.

642
00:25:18,840 --> 00:25:20,440
Then some simple renovations,

643
00:25:20,440 --> 00:25:22,600
buying materials
and replacing equipment, at least

644
00:25:23,039 --> 00:25:23,799
200,000 yuan.

645
00:25:24,880 --> 00:25:26,079
Almost 300,000 yuan in total.

646
00:25:26,640 --> 00:25:27,319
About right.

647
00:25:28,160 --> 00:25:30,759
Next, let's all work hard
to get the money.

648
00:25:30,937 --> 00:25:33,160
You didn't get the money
before negotiating?

649
00:25:33,230 --> 00:25:35,537
How would I know how much
we need without negotiating?

650
00:25:36,440 --> 00:25:37,559
Now you know.

651
00:25:37,880 --> 00:25:39,200
Where will you get the money?

652
00:25:40,960 --> 00:25:41,999
I plan to sell a house.

653
00:25:43,440 --> 00:25:45,640
If we sell the house,
where will we live?

654
00:25:46,719 --> 00:25:48,559
I plan to rent a place.

655
00:25:49,440 --> 00:25:50,279
I calculated it.

656
00:25:50,600 --> 00:25:51,999
After selling this house,

657
00:25:52,319 --> 00:25:54,200
we can pay off all external debts,

658
00:25:54,382 --> 00:25:56,271
and still have over 300,000 yuan left.

659
00:25:56,271 --> 00:25:58,160
This way, we can take over
the F&B department

660
00:25:58,160 --> 00:25:59,079
of Nanxi Hotel.

661
00:25:59,519 --> 00:26:00,759
Once we do well,

662
00:26:01,120 --> 00:26:02,640
the household will have income.

663
00:26:03,079 --> 00:26:04,360
What about if we don't do well?

664
00:26:05,079 --> 00:26:06,799
The house is gone,
and the money is gone.

665
00:26:07,860 --> 00:26:09,039
So what do you suggest we do?

666
00:26:11,200 --> 00:26:12,640
Now there are three of us.

667
00:26:13,160 --> 00:26:14,799
In the future, there will be four.

668
00:26:15,440 --> 00:26:17,309
We can't just lie around at home

669
00:26:17,310 --> 00:26:18,937
and live off nothing until we run out.

670
00:26:21,479 --> 00:26:22,479
If we don't do well,

671
00:26:23,319 --> 00:26:24,519
then you go out to work.

672
00:26:25,039 --> 00:26:26,719
I'll stay home to take care of everyone.

673
00:26:27,230 --> 00:26:30,071
I don't believe we can starve.

Hello, who are you looking for?

676
00:27:06,360 --> 00:27:07,440
I'm looking for Mr. Guan.

677
00:27:07,560 --> 00:27:09,120
For logistics issues, talk to logistics.

678
00:27:09,130 --> 00:27:10,600
For warehouse issues,
talk to the warehouse.

679
00:27:10,600 --> 00:27:12,360
This matter must
be investigated thoroughly.

680
00:27:12,360 --> 00:27:14,200
Mr. Guan. Someone is looking for you.

681
00:27:14,519 --> 00:27:15,079
Who?

682
00:27:16,559 --> 00:27:17,600
Mr. Guan, hello.

00:27:20,479 --> 00:27:21,039
Hello.

685
00:27:21,239 --> 00:27:22,160
Why are you here?

686
00:27:22,279 --> 00:27:22,759
You...

687
00:27:23,039 --> 00:27:23,759
Please come in.

688
00:27:23,759 --> 00:27:24,360
You go ahead.

689
00:27:24,360 --> 00:27:25,039
Come, please.

690
00:27:25,039 --> 00:27:25,880

- Here.
- Okay.

692
00:27:27,519 --> 00:27:28,550
Come, please sit.

693
00:27:28,560 --> 00:27:29,360
Sorry to bother you.

694
00:27:29,360 --> 00:27:30,079
It's nothing.

You...

Mr. Guan.

699
00:27:37,920 --> 00:27:39,840
Could you give me a glass of warm water?

700
00:27:39,840 --> 00:27:40,479
Of course.

701
00:27:40,479 --> 00:27:41,400
I want to take some medicine.

702
00:27:41,400 --> 00:27:42,200
Alright.

00:27:50,640 --> 00:27:52,120
Here, Mrs. Feng, the water.

704
00:27:52,120 --> 00:27:53,509
Alright, thank you.

- Thanks.
- It's nothing.

came to my place.

I saw her health isn't very good,

710
00:28:20,880 --> 00:28:22,448
so I want to inform you in advance.

711
00:28:24,120 --> 00:28:25,079
Don't worry.

712
00:28:25,400 --> 00:28:26,600
Okay.

713
00:28:36,079 --> 00:28:37,279
Are you feeling better?

714
00:28:37,920 --> 00:28:38,479
Yes.

715
00:28:38,479 --> 00:28:38,960
Here.

716
00:28:38,960 --> 00:28:39,600
Sorry.

717
00:28:39,600 --> 00:28:41,640
It's fine. I'll add more
water for you. Here.

718

- Drink more water.
- Thanks.

It's nothing.

What happened to you?

00:28:54,039 --> 00:28:57,200
I had a brain hemorrhage before,

722
00:28:58,559 --> 00:29:00,200
and came close to death.

723
00:29:00,719 --> 00:29:01,600
But I survived.

724
00:29:03,039 --> 00:29:03,719
Right.

725
00:29:03,960 --> 00:29:06,200
The neurosurgery at Huashan Hospital
is excellent.

726
00:29:06,493 --> 00:29:07,400
I could help you...

727
00:29:07,400 --> 00:29:08,279
No.

728
00:29:08,279 --> 00:29:09,680
Thank you.

729
00:29:10,039 --> 00:29:11,799
I've recovered very well.

730
00:29:12,120 --> 00:29:13,279
See, now I can even

731
00:29:13,279 --> 00:29:15,079
come here myself to see you.

732
00:29:15,719 --> 00:29:16,999
That's great.

733
00:29:16,999 --> 00:29:17,640
Thank you.

734
00:29:17,640 --> 00:29:18,600
That's good.

735
00:29:26,360 --> 00:29:27,440
Mr. Guan.

736
00:29:28,200 --> 00:29:28,840
Well...

737
00:29:30,519 --> 00:29:33,559
Last time you came to my house,

738
00:29:34,120 --> 00:29:35,559
I drove you away.

739
00:29:37,600 --> 00:29:38,519
I'm sorry.

740
00:29:38,759 --> 00:29:39,440
It's fine.

741
00:29:39,719 --> 00:29:40,239
I...

742
00:29:41,279 --> 00:29:43,279
Back then, my heart

743
00:29:45,759 --> 00:29:47,559
was just too broken.

744
00:29:51,319 --> 00:29:52,160
Sorry.

745
00:29:52,519 --> 00:29:53,360
No worries.

746
00:29:54,239 --> 00:29:55,039
No one can bear

747
00:29:55,493 --> 00:29:56,710
the pain of losing a child.

748
00:30:05,200 --> 00:30:05,799
Mr. Guan.

749
00:30:07,079 --> 00:30:08,799
Before this,

750
00:30:09,600 --> 00:30:11,079
I didn't realize your good intentions

751
00:30:11,640 --> 00:30:12,999
and embarrassed you.

752
00:30:13,600 --> 00:30:16,759
I'm here today specifically

753
00:30:17,479 --> 00:30:19,360
to apologize to you.

754
00:30:19,360 --> 00:30:19,999
I'm sorry.

755
00:30:19,999 --> 00:30:21,600
Please don't say that.

756
00:30:21,680 --> 00:30:22,999
Our whole family will never forget

757
00:30:23,479 --> 00:30:25,600
Jianqi's great kindness.

758
00:30:33,360 --> 00:30:34,559
Hello, are you Ms. Mao?

759
00:30:35,640 --> 00:30:36,640
I am Xu Zhixia.

760
00:30:37,120 --> 00:30:37,999
Ms. Xu, right?

761
00:30:38,070 --> 00:30:39,137
Come, please, this way.

762
00:30:39,782 --> 00:30:40,990
You're really dedicated.

763
00:30:40,999 --> 00:30:42,239
Still working while pregnant.

764
00:30:42,440 --> 00:30:43,840
Earning milk money for the baby.

765
00:30:45,759 --> 00:30:46,360
Ms. Mao, look.

766
00:30:46,360 --> 00:30:47,759
I'm pregnant,

767
00:30:48,039 --> 00:30:49,880
and trying out
your maternity care products

768
00:30:49,880 --> 00:30:51,600
gives a more intuitive experience.

769
00:30:51,759 --> 00:30:53,440
Later, when writing the review article,

770
00:30:53,440 --> 00:30:54,799
it will be more convincing.

771
00:30:54,799 --> 00:30:55,680
What do you think?

772
00:30:55,960 --> 00:30:57,079
This idea is good.

773
00:30:57,079 --> 00:30:57,719
How about this?

774
00:30:57,719 --> 00:30:59,319
Send me your public account's pricing.

775
00:30:59,400 --> 00:31:00,160
No problem.

776
00:31:00,519 --> 00:31:01,600
I think we can also

777
00:31:01,600 --> 00:31:03,640
discuss a package discount.

778
00:31:03,860 --> 00:31:05,710
I'll write properly,
all the way until birth,

779
00:31:05,719 --> 00:31:07,160
which fits a promotional cycle.

780
00:31:07,160 --> 00:31:07,880
What do you think?

781
00:31:08,039 --> 00:31:08,799
Sounds good.

782
00:31:08,999 --> 00:31:09,479
Then,

783
00:31:09,479 --> 00:31:12,079
we'll talk about how
to apply this discount properly.

784
00:31:12,079 --> 00:31:13,120
- Okay.
- Alright.

785
00:31:13,120 --> 00:31:13,799
Here, please.

786
00:31:20,360 --> 00:31:21,039
I...

787
00:31:24,640 --> 00:31:27,960
I just came to ask a favor.

788
00:31:29,440 --> 00:31:32,559
Meiqi and Mingzhu

789
00:31:32,880 --> 00:31:35,920
want to take over the restaurant
at Nanxi Hotel.

790
00:31:37,559 --> 00:31:38,759
We need some money.

791
00:31:40,239 --> 00:31:41,640
If we don't have this money,

792
00:31:42,239 --> 00:31:44,120
we'll have to sell the house.

793
00:31:46,999 --> 00:31:47,759
Understood.

794
00:31:48,960 --> 00:31:49,960
How much do you need?

795
00:31:50,071 --> 00:31:52,271
I'll have finance transfer it
to you right away.

796
00:31:59,279 --> 00:31:59,920
Mr. Guan.

797
00:32:00,960 --> 00:32:02,079
I know

798
00:32:03,279 --> 00:32:04,999
if I ask you for a loan,

799
00:32:09,039 --> 00:32:11,279
you definitely won't make me
pay it back.

800
00:32:13,920 --> 00:32:15,079
This is...

801
00:32:18,519 --> 00:32:19,559
This is an IOU.

802
00:32:19,759 --> 00:32:20,640
No.

803
00:32:20,960 --> 00:32:22,270
Mrs. Feng, you don't need to.

804
00:32:22,279 --> 00:32:23,680
We don't need an IOU between us.

805
00:32:23,680 --> 00:32:25,239
Listen to me.

806
00:32:26,719 --> 00:32:29,200
I will definitely pay this money back.

807
00:32:29,799 --> 00:32:30,440
Mrs. Feng...

808
00:32:30,440 --> 00:32:31,440
Take it.

809
00:32:31,440 --> 00:32:33,270
- Mom.
- I will definitely pay it back.

810
00:32:33,279 --> 00:32:34,200
Are you okay?

811
00:32:34,640 --> 00:32:35,680
I'm fine.

812
00:32:36,871 --> 00:32:37,920
- Well...
- I'm fine.

813
00:32:37,920 --> 00:32:39,319
Why did you come here?

814
00:32:40,360 --> 00:32:42,120
Mingzhu, listen to me.

815
00:32:43,279 --> 00:32:45,680
I really had no other choice.

816
00:32:46,880 --> 00:32:48,120
I can't let you

817
00:32:48,120 --> 00:32:49,479
carry the family's debt alone.

818
00:32:51,120 --> 00:32:52,279
The house can't be sold.

819
00:32:52,279 --> 00:32:54,200
That was Jianqi's gift for you
and the child,

820
00:32:54,200 --> 00:32:55,120
the only thing.

821
00:32:55,120 --> 00:32:55,920
It can't be sold.

822
00:32:56,400 --> 00:32:57,719
I can't let the child

823
00:32:57,719 --> 00:32:59,400
suffer with us from birth.

824
00:32:59,400 --> 00:33:00,160
I can't.

825
00:33:00,160 --> 00:33:01,160
Yes, Ms. Shen.

826
00:33:01,680 --> 00:33:02,680
Mrs. Feng is right.

827
00:33:02,920 --> 00:33:04,640
This amount of money

828
00:33:04,920 --> 00:33:05,799
is no pressure for me.

829
00:33:06,239 --> 00:33:06,920
Mr. Guan.

830
00:33:07,600 --> 00:33:08,999
You can help us now,

831
00:33:09,400 --> 00:33:10,840
but not forever.

832
00:33:11,239 --> 00:33:13,479
Even if you lend us the money today,

833
00:33:14,039 --> 00:33:14,640
later on,

834
00:33:14,640 --> 00:33:16,200
there will be many more expenses.

835
00:33:16,519 --> 00:33:18,680
Renovation, operations, all cost money.

836
00:33:19,160 --> 00:33:21,799
I can't keep coming to you
for money every time.

837
00:33:22,039 --> 00:33:23,120
Mingzhu.

838
00:33:23,440 --> 00:33:24,680
How about this?

839
00:33:25,279 --> 00:33:27,799
I'll buy the house first.

840
00:33:28,120 --> 00:33:29,400
Later, when you have money,

841
00:33:29,680 --> 00:33:30,920
you can buy it back.

842
00:33:32,079 --> 00:33:32,640
No.

843
00:33:34,079 --> 00:33:36,279
We can't live our lives relying
on your generosity.

844
00:33:39,519 --> 00:33:39,999
Mom.

845
00:33:40,999 --> 00:33:42,519
I know you mean well,

846
00:33:43,680 --> 00:33:45,360
but we can manage on our own.

847
00:33:46,200 --> 00:33:47,640
You have to trust me and Meiqi.

848
00:33:47,920 --> 00:33:50,799
I trust. I do.

849
00:33:51,719 --> 00:33:52,479
Ms. Shen.

850
00:33:53,039 --> 00:33:54,319
You mentioned renovation?

851
00:33:55,079 --> 00:33:56,519
I can handle renovation.

852
00:33:57,559 --> 00:33:59,759
Building materials are my specialty.

853
00:34:00,440 --> 00:34:02,039
We can calculate costs properly.

854
00:34:02,680 --> 00:34:03,840
At least give me a chance.

855
00:34:03,937 --> 00:34:06,382
If I contract it, it'll definitely
be cheaper than outside.

856
00:34:07,479 --> 00:34:08,440
Yes.

857
00:34:08,937 --> 00:34:09,960
- Alright.
- Thank you.

858
00:34:10,119 --> 00:34:10,920
Don't say like that.

859
00:34:10,920 --> 00:34:12,280
Don't say thanks, Mrs. Feng.

860
00:34:17,479 --> 00:34:18,599
Your house

861
00:34:19,440 --> 00:34:21,280
(On urgent sale)
is listed way too cheap.

862
00:34:21,360 --> 00:34:23,880
In a rush to sell.
I need money to pay debts.

863
00:34:23,880 --> 00:34:25,337
I can't list it too high.

864
00:34:26,760 --> 00:34:28,679
Well, your house is so good.

865
00:34:28,679 --> 00:34:30,559
Used such good materials
in the renovation.

866
00:34:30,559 --> 00:34:31,960
Once sold, it can't be bought back.

867
00:34:33,159 --> 00:34:34,400
What if we don't sell?

868
00:34:34,400 --> 00:34:36,119
The family owes a ton of debt.

869
00:34:36,248 --> 00:34:37,670
My mother-in-law's medical bills

870
00:34:37,679 --> 00:34:39,440
are now nearly 2,000 yuan a month.

871
00:34:39,760 --> 00:34:41,079
Money is needed everywhere.

872
00:34:41,320 --> 00:34:42,599
Every day I dream

873
00:34:42,800 --> 00:34:44,599
about filling the holes.

874
00:34:45,826 --> 00:34:47,070
And now the whole neighborhood

875
00:34:47,079 --> 00:34:48,440
knows our situation.

876
00:34:48,920 --> 00:34:51,479
I'm worried buyers will check

877
00:34:51,599 --> 00:34:52,920
and think this house is unlucky.

878
00:34:52,920 --> 00:34:54,248
In the end, it couldn't be sold.

879
00:35:06,679 --> 00:35:07,679
Then sell it to me.

880
00:35:11,400 --> 00:35:13,960
Your marital house
and wedding decor suit me.

881
00:35:14,320 --> 00:35:16,400
Hu Gang and I are getting married
very soon.

882
00:35:17,519 --> 00:35:18,159
No.

883
00:35:18,960 --> 00:35:20,679
You don't think this house is unlucky?

884
00:35:21,199 --> 00:35:22,800
What would I be superstitious about?

885
00:35:22,804 --> 00:35:23,880
Look at my Dad's portrait.

886
00:35:23,880 --> 00:35:25,639
It's been on my wall
for more than ten years.

887
00:35:25,639 --> 00:35:27,469
And my dad's still lively.

888
00:35:27,470 --> 00:35:29,271
After remarrying,
he even had a successor.

889
00:35:29,315 --> 00:35:31,160
The Ni family doesn't care
about these things.

890
00:35:33,800 --> 00:35:34,679
Don't be too touched.

891
00:35:35,960 --> 00:35:37,119
Give me a discount.

892
00:35:37,119 --> 00:35:38,199
Round off the small change.

893
00:35:38,760 --> 00:35:39,559
Anyway,

894
00:35:39,559 --> 00:35:41,440
I'm always a bag holder
for the Feng family.

895
00:35:47,720 --> 00:35:48,880
Don't eat? Have some.

896
00:35:49,679 --> 00:35:50,320
Eat.

897
00:36:01,199 --> 00:36:01,960
Mr. Guan.

898
00:36:02,199 --> 00:36:03,159
I didn't expect

899
00:36:03,159 --> 00:36:04,679
your team to be so professional.

900
00:36:05,119 --> 00:36:06,840
Please don't be polite, Mr. Shen.

901
00:36:06,999 --> 00:36:07,840
I'm not being polite.

902
00:36:07,840 --> 00:36:09,199
I just came to learn.

903
00:36:09,199 --> 00:36:10,880
You know,
I know nothing about renovation

904
00:36:10,880 --> 00:36:11,840
at all.

905
00:36:11,840 --> 00:36:13,679
Don't worry, I'll put in my best effort.

906
00:36:14,999 --> 00:36:15,679
Go ahead.

907
00:36:18,400 --> 00:36:19,039
Mr. Guan.

908
00:36:20,039 --> 00:36:21,559
Dad, why are you here so early?

909
00:36:21,960 --> 00:36:24,199
I came to learn.

910
00:36:24,199 --> 00:36:25,400
Now with renovation,

911
00:36:25,400 --> 00:36:26,999
I have to learn properly from Mr. Guan.

912
00:36:27,079 --> 00:36:28,199
Mr. Shen, Mr. Guan.

913
00:36:28,360 --> 00:36:28,840
Hello.

914
00:36:29,119 --> 00:36:30,840
Mr. Guan, for this renovation,

915
00:36:30,840 --> 00:36:32,626
water and electricity
are the top priority.

916
00:36:32,648 --> 00:36:33,071
Alright.

917
00:36:33,079 --> 00:36:34,920
For the wiring, let's use Siping brand.

918
00:36:35,320 --> 00:36:36,679
Good quality, lasts long.

919
00:36:37,519 --> 00:36:38,400
I think

920
00:36:38,599 --> 00:36:40,840
the kitchen needs high power, use 4.0.

921
00:36:40,960 --> 00:36:43,119
But 2.5 is enough for the foyer.

922
00:36:43,119 --> 00:36:44,479
This saves money.

923
00:36:44,960 --> 00:36:45,559
Meiqi,

924
00:36:45,720 --> 00:36:47,599
now you finally know how to save money.

925
00:36:49,159 --> 00:36:49,840
Yes.

926
00:37:01,199 --> 00:37:01,920
Jiao.

927
00:37:02,519 --> 00:37:03,199
Mom.

928
00:37:03,893 --> 00:37:05,470
(Nanzhou Shengli Primary School)
Ms. Shen, sorry.

929
00:37:05,479 --> 00:37:06,320
It's okay.

930
00:37:06,320 --> 00:37:07,320
Jiao, your mom is here.

931
00:37:07,320 --> 00:37:08,320
Thanks, bye.

932
00:37:08,320 --> 00:37:09,119
- Bye.
- Bye.

933
00:37:10,079 --> 00:37:11,159
Were you anxious, Jiao?

934
00:37:11,479 --> 00:37:12,199
Not at all.

935
00:37:13,199 --> 00:37:14,639
How did you do in math today?

936
00:37:14,840 --> 00:37:15,679
Not well.

937
00:37:16,479 --> 00:37:17,039
Mom.

938
00:37:17,039 --> 00:37:18,320
What's for dinner tonight?

939
00:37:18,320 --> 00:37:20,360
If you didn't do well,
what's there to eat?

940
00:37:21,159 --> 00:37:23,479
People are iron, and food is steel.

941
00:37:23,479 --> 00:37:25,240
If you skip a meal, you get starving.

942
00:37:26,679 --> 00:37:27,960
Alright, no time to cook.

943
00:37:27,960 --> 00:37:29,599
Go to your dad's workplace
for a meal.

944
00:37:30,199 --> 00:37:30,840
Got it.

945
00:37:30,840 --> 00:37:31,800
Seat belt.

946
00:37:38,920 --> 00:37:39,440
Hao.

947
00:37:39,440 --> 00:37:40,400
Come quickly.

948
00:37:43,079 --> 00:37:43,679
Dad.

949
00:37:44,400 --> 00:37:45,639
Ordered so many dishes?

950
00:37:45,639 --> 00:37:47,840
Because I ordered all dishes Jiao loves.

951
00:37:48,519 --> 00:37:49,679
Dad is the best.

952
00:37:49,679 --> 00:37:50,920
Of course I'm the best.

953
00:37:52,440 --> 00:37:54,320
Tell your dad how much you scored
in math.

954
00:37:54,320 --> 00:37:55,880
See if he still loves you so much.

955
00:37:55,880 --> 00:37:57,920
Don't want to hear it.
Just don't want to hear this.

956
00:37:57,920 --> 00:37:58,800
Let's eat first.

957
00:37:58,880 --> 00:37:59,519
Exactly.

958
00:38:00,159 --> 00:38:01,479
Just spoil her, okay?

959
00:38:07,639 --> 00:38:08,199
Wu.

960
00:38:10,560 --> 00:38:11,960
Can I do the social recruitment

961
00:38:11,960 --> 00:38:13,582
presentation during overtime tonight?

962
00:38:15,199 --> 00:38:16,039
You need it now?

963
00:38:17,150 --> 00:38:18,671
Can't it wait until after dinner?

964
00:38:21,159 --> 00:38:21,800
Well...

965
00:38:22,679 --> 00:38:23,920
My daughter is here.

966
00:38:24,360 --> 00:38:25,800
I want to eat with her for a while.

967
00:38:25,999 --> 00:38:27,119
In ten minutes, okay?

968
00:38:29,315 --> 00:38:30,550
Alright, I'll come over now.

969
00:38:32,760 --> 00:38:33,880
What presentation?

970
00:38:34,159 --> 00:38:35,240
Urgent presentation?

971
00:38:35,982 --> 00:38:37,880
Actually,
this social recruitment presentation

972
00:38:37,880 --> 00:38:38,840
is for next week.

973
00:38:40,039 --> 00:38:40,999
But Wu,

974
00:38:41,626 --> 00:38:43,182
the new boss, is making a strong start,

975
00:38:43,182 --> 00:38:44,360
and wants to assert authority.

976
00:38:44,880 --> 00:38:45,999
Scare you as a warning?

977
00:38:45,999 --> 00:38:47,240
What?

978
00:38:47,400 --> 00:38:48,639
What am I?

979
00:38:48,760 --> 00:38:49,720
Alright, eat quickly.

980
00:38:49,760 --> 00:38:50,999
Jiao, eat more.

981
00:38:50,999 --> 00:38:51,599
Okay.

982
00:38:51,599 --> 00:38:52,760
I am going to work.

983
00:38:53,639 --> 00:38:54,199
Hurry and eat.

984
00:38:54,960 --> 00:38:56,119
Eat something before leaving.

985
00:38:56,159 --> 00:38:56,960
Spoil him once.

986
00:39:11,599 --> 00:39:12,599
Why so late?

987
00:39:12,920 --> 00:39:15,039
Rush hour. The elevator is hard to get.

988
00:39:15,737 --> 00:39:16,960
Ten minutes is not enough?

989
00:39:16,960 --> 00:39:17,760
So impatient?

990
00:39:17,760 --> 00:39:18,240
Yes.

991
00:39:23,199 --> 00:39:25,199
Zhang Hao,
do you have a problem with me?

992
00:39:27,119 --> 00:39:27,760
Wu.

993
00:39:27,760 --> 00:39:28,679
It's Manager Wu.

994
00:39:34,320 --> 00:39:35,079
Manager Wu.

995
00:39:36,039 --> 00:39:38,720
CTO is a combined role of tech
and management director.

996
00:39:39,079 --> 00:39:41,199
It requires long-term experience.

997
00:39:41,360 --> 00:39:43,199
So I suggest maybe we can

998
00:39:43,880 --> 00:39:45,199
extend the age limit to 40.

999
00:39:45,199 --> 00:39:45,960
Forty?

1000
00:39:46,137 --> 00:39:47,982
Our group is like a retirement home?

1001
00:39:48,519 --> 00:39:50,559
How is forty a retirement home?

1002
00:39:50,800 --> 00:39:52,320
I'm almost forty too.

1003
00:39:52,320 --> 00:39:54,679
Exactly, because you're forty.

1004
00:39:54,760 --> 00:39:56,159
So that proves people at forty

1005
00:39:56,159 --> 00:39:57,320
are basically useless.

1006
00:39:57,639 --> 00:39:58,880
Full of negative emotions.

1007
00:39:59,039 --> 00:40:00,871
Always late.
How am I supposed to manage?

1008
00:40:00,893 --> 00:40:01,515
No.

1009
00:40:02,960 --> 00:40:03,679
Manager Wu.

1010
00:40:03,679 --> 00:40:06,199
I suggest you know when
to stop sometimes, okay?

1011
00:40:06,400 --> 00:40:07,960
Don't use seniority to pressure me.

1012
00:40:07,960 --> 00:40:09,199
I don't buy that.

1013
00:40:09,199 --> 00:40:10,320
Then what do you buy?

1014
00:40:10,320 --> 00:40:11,599
What are you doing?

1015
00:40:11,720 --> 00:40:12,560
Am I a persimmon?

1016
00:40:12,570 --> 00:40:13,720
Why do you keep pinching me?

1017
00:40:13,720 --> 00:40:15,137
Zhang Hao, if you're not satisfied,

1018
00:40:15,160 --> 00:40:16,400
go ahead and be the manager.

1019
00:40:16,519 --> 00:40:17,679
Do you have the ability?

1020
00:40:20,440 --> 00:40:20,999
Dad.

1021
00:40:25,599 --> 00:40:26,840
Jiao, how did you come?

1022
00:40:29,360 --> 00:40:30,720
Mom asked me to bring you dinner.

1023
00:40:32,280 --> 00:40:32,800
Here.

1024
00:40:33,519 --> 00:40:34,240
Okay, got it.

1025
00:40:34,240 --> 00:40:35,400
Go quickly.

1026
00:40:37,039 --> 00:40:37,720
Go quickly.

1027
00:40:41,519 --> 00:40:42,159
Dad.

1028
00:40:42,880 --> 00:40:44,039
You're the best.

1029
00:40:47,360 --> 00:40:48,720
Of course I know that.

1030
00:40:55,360 --> 00:40:56,039
My daughter.

1031
00:40:59,240 --> 00:41:00,400
Have you thought it through?

1032
00:41:01,440 --> 00:41:02,559
Really selling the house?

1033
00:41:04,960 --> 00:41:06,280
Mom, the house is already sold.

1034
00:41:06,999 --> 00:41:08,039
Ni took over it.

1035
00:41:09,720 --> 00:41:11,199
What? That fast?

1036
00:41:13,920 --> 00:41:14,519
Then you...

1037
00:41:15,119 --> 00:41:16,360
You sold the house, and you...

1038
00:41:16,360 --> 00:41:18,400
Have you thought
about where you'll live?

1039
00:41:18,679 --> 00:41:19,999
We'll rent a place.

1040
00:41:20,639 --> 00:41:21,679
That won't work.

1041
00:41:22,360 --> 00:41:24,400
Adults can endure this suffering,

1042
00:41:24,400 --> 00:41:26,039
but the kid can't handle that...

1043
00:41:26,119 --> 00:41:27,079
It's okay, Mom.

1044
00:41:27,240 --> 00:41:28,400
Renting is fine.

1045
00:41:28,400 --> 00:41:29,400
Don't worry.

1046
00:41:30,479 --> 00:41:32,440
You've got money but nowhere
to spend it, huh?

1047
00:41:36,559 --> 00:41:38,079
I discussed it with your dad.

1048
00:41:39,079 --> 00:41:40,400
If you really sell the house,

1049
00:41:40,400 --> 00:41:42,559
you all can just move in here.

1050
00:41:44,479 --> 00:41:45,639
All move in together?

1051
00:41:46,519 --> 00:41:47,519
How can that work?

1052
00:41:47,800 --> 00:41:49,039
Absolutely not, Mom.

1053
00:41:49,671 --> 00:41:50,760
This is just making things

1054
00:41:50,760 --> 00:41:51,960
difficult for you and my dad.

1055
00:41:52,679 --> 00:41:53,440
Besides,

1056
00:41:53,519 --> 00:41:55,199
so many people and mouths.

1057
00:41:55,400 --> 00:41:56,159
Back and forth,

1058
00:41:56,159 --> 00:41:57,880
any sentence could cause conflict.

1059
00:41:57,999 --> 00:41:58,999
Absolutely not.

1060
00:41:58,999 --> 00:41:59,800
I'm already

1061
00:41:59,800 --> 00:42:01,479
used to your mother-in-law.

1062
00:42:02,280 --> 00:42:03,720
In the future, if she really

1063
00:42:03,720 --> 00:42:05,639
annoys me too much, I'll learn from you.

1064
00:42:05,880 --> 00:42:07,880
Just treat her as singing.

1065
00:42:07,920 --> 00:42:08,720
That won't work.

1066
00:42:09,026 --> 00:42:10,639
Why is this kid so stubborn? Come here.

1067
00:42:11,400 --> 00:42:12,119
Come see.

1068
00:42:13,519 --> 00:42:14,119
Come here.

1069
00:42:17,079 --> 00:42:17,679
Come in.

1070
00:42:23,039 --> 00:42:23,999
What's going on?

1071
00:42:24,240 --> 00:42:25,079
Your brother

1072
00:42:26,159 --> 00:42:27,880
knew you were selling the house,

1073
00:42:28,240 --> 00:42:29,760
so he cleaned this place up.

1074
00:42:30,679 --> 00:42:31,519
No, he's living...

1075
00:42:31,519 --> 00:42:32,760
How can he live here?

1076
00:42:32,760 --> 00:42:33,960
This definitely won't work.

1077
00:42:34,519 --> 00:42:36,119
He's finally being sensible.

1078
00:42:36,119 --> 00:42:37,920
Give him a chance as his sister.

1079
00:42:38,519 --> 00:42:39,720
It's decided then.

1080
00:42:41,599 --> 00:42:42,599
Hurry up.

1081
00:42:42,760 --> 00:42:44,119
Keep eating. Hurry.
