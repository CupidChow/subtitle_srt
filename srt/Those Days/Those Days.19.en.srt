(Adapted from iceread.com novel
"You Xi" by Qingyang Wanxi)

00:01:14,980 --> 00:01:17,980
=Episode 19=

4
00:01:21,340 --> 00:01:23,540
The flower arrangement there,
move it a bit further in.

5
00:01:23,660 --> 00:01:24,220
Got it.

6
00:01:25,210 --> 00:01:26,180
More towards the inside.

7
00:01:27,060 --> 00:01:28,460
Yes, yes, that's perfect.

8
00:01:29,180 --> 00:01:30,540
So, you made your stand.

9
00:01:30,540 --> 00:01:32,320
From now on, you call the
shots for your kid.

10
00:01:32,340 --> 00:01:33,420
Absolutely.

11
00:01:33,560 --> 00:01:36,280
And from now on, whether I wear
long johns or not is my decision too.

12
00:01:36,300 --> 00:01:36,820
Good for you.

13
00:01:37,580 --> 00:01:40,180
Like they say, kindness without
boundaries is just weakness.

14
00:01:40,180 --> 00:01:42,740
As a single mother, you have to fight even
harder for yourself.

15
00:01:43,280 --> 00:01:45,460
Those of you hanging the curtains,
be careful up there.

16
00:01:45,460 --> 00:01:46,340
Safety first.

17
00:01:48,660 --> 00:01:49,340
Look around.

18
00:01:49,900 --> 00:01:50,860
What do you think?

19
00:01:52,100 --> 00:01:53,380
Super classy.

20
00:01:53,940 --> 00:01:56,340
Ni's design, nothing else compares.

21
00:02:06,860 --> 00:02:07,700
Hello, Mingzhu.

22
00:02:08,100 --> 00:02:08,820
Dr. Li,

23
00:02:09,220 --> 00:02:10,060
let me show you

24
00:02:10,060 --> 00:02:11,780
the wedding venue we decorated.

25
00:02:25,420 --> 00:02:26,620
Isn't the vibe great?

26
00:02:27,080 --> 00:02:29,750
(You can use this as a reference
for your uncle's birthday banquet.)

27
00:02:29,780 --> 00:02:30,660
(If you want,)

28
00:02:30,660 --> 00:02:32,300
(I can send a video to your cousin.)

29
00:02:32,540 --> 00:02:33,900
Sure, go ahead and send it to him.

30
00:02:33,980 --> 00:02:35,910
I'm not really the decision-maker
for the event,

31
00:02:35,920 --> 00:02:36,950
so it's better he sees it.

32
00:02:38,620 --> 00:02:40,780
My best friend is the owner
of an event company.

33
00:02:40,780 --> 00:02:42,160
I can have her give you a discount.

34
00:02:43,340 --> 00:02:45,300
- Hi, Dr. Li. I've heard about you.
- Hello.

35
00:02:45,540 --> 00:02:46,830
(This is my best friend, Ni.)

36
00:02:46,840 --> 00:02:48,340
If you ever have a baby in the future,

37
00:02:48,340 --> 00:02:49,380
you can always come to me.

38
00:02:50,500 --> 00:02:52,100
Do doctors all talk like this?

39
00:02:52,100 --> 00:02:53,500
Good thing you're not an oncologist.

40
00:02:53,520 --> 00:02:55,900
I actually know a few oncologists too.
Need me to refer you?

41
00:02:55,980 --> 00:02:56,900
No, absolutely not.

42
00:02:56,900 --> 00:02:57,660
I do not need that.

43
00:02:57,660 --> 00:02:59,020
I will never need that. Thank you.

44
00:02:59,020 --> 00:03:00,620
You never know.

45
00:03:00,940 --> 00:03:03,020
How do you even know someone like this?

46
00:03:03,020 --> 00:03:03,780
He's actually really nice.

47
00:03:03,780 --> 00:03:04,920
You just don't know him yet.

48
00:03:05,480 --> 00:03:06,400
Dr. Li, how about this,

49
00:03:06,410 --> 00:03:08,460
I'll give your uncle's
birthday banquet a discount.

50
00:03:08,460 --> 00:03:10,050
Just don't see me as a patient, okay?

51
00:03:10,060 --> 00:03:12,260
Deal. Better to rely on yourself
than on a doctor.

52
00:03:12,260 --> 00:03:13,580
Have Mingzhu create a group chat.

53
00:03:13,580 --> 00:03:16,040
I'll send you a full "100 Questions
About Cancer Prevention."

54
00:03:17,820 --> 00:03:18,940
Talk soon, Dr. Li.

55
00:03:20,580 --> 00:03:21,180
Speechless.

56
00:03:21,300 --> 00:03:21,940
Insensitive guy.

57
00:03:22,540 --> 00:03:23,620
Utterly speechless.

58
00:03:33,580 --> 00:03:35,500
(One Heart One Love Diamond)
Young man.

59
00:03:35,500 --> 00:03:37,060
Which one do you like?

60
00:03:37,780 --> 00:03:38,790
May I take a look at this?

61
00:03:39,140 --> 00:03:41,020
Of course. One moment.

62
00:03:46,580 --> 00:03:47,580
Look at this jade bean.

63
00:03:48,220 --> 00:03:49,100
Look at that luster.

64
00:03:50,220 --> 00:03:50,980
Beautiful, right?

65
00:03:51,970 --> 00:03:53,360
You're still in school, aren't you?

66
00:03:53,820 --> 00:03:56,780
These three beans symbolize
"triple success" in the exams.

67
00:03:56,790 --> 00:03:59,030
It'll give you the blessing
to get into famous universities!

68
00:03:59,040 --> 00:03:59,930
So, what do you think?

69
00:03:59,940 --> 00:04:00,660
It's pretty nice.

70
00:04:00,660 --> 00:04:01,380
Right?

71
00:04:01,380 --> 00:04:02,620
We have a special today,

72
00:04:02,940 --> 00:04:03,700
just 800 yuan.

73
00:04:04,140 --> 00:04:05,020
Want to take one?

74
00:04:06,140 --> 00:04:08,660
Ma'am, could I take a look
at that jade bracelet?

75
00:04:10,620 --> 00:04:11,940
That bracelet is too expensive.

76
00:04:12,310 --> 00:04:13,660
A student like you can't afford it.

77
00:04:13,940 --> 00:04:14,820
How expensive, ma'am?

78
00:04:16,340 --> 00:04:17,780
After the discount, 38,000 yuan.

79
00:04:18,580 --> 00:04:19,620
And don't call me "Ma'am."

80
00:04:19,620 --> 00:04:21,140
Do I look that old? Call me "Miss."

81
00:04:21,460 --> 00:04:22,140
Miss,

82
00:04:22,500 --> 00:04:23,460
we can afford it.

83
00:04:24,020 --> 00:04:24,900
My mom wants it,

84
00:04:25,500 --> 00:04:26,700
my dad's paying.

85
00:04:26,980 --> 00:04:29,020
I'm just the errand boy,
you know how it is.

86
00:04:31,020 --> 00:04:32,220
Got it.

87
00:04:34,060 --> 00:04:34,700
Young man,

88
00:04:34,700 --> 00:04:36,380
your mother is very lucky.

89
00:04:36,980 --> 00:04:38,020
You have a good eye.

90
00:04:38,500 --> 00:04:40,020
Look at this bracelet,

91
00:04:40,420 --> 00:04:41,700
see that mix of green and white?

92
00:04:41,900 --> 00:04:42,660
Gorgeous.

93
00:04:42,820 --> 00:04:43,660
Once your mom

94
00:04:43,660 --> 00:04:45,020
puts this on,

95
00:04:45,620 --> 00:04:46,620
no words needed,

96
00:04:46,700 --> 00:04:48,260
her status speaks for itself.

97
00:04:49,220 --> 00:04:49,860
Right?

98
00:04:50,860 --> 00:04:51,700
Round it down.

99
00:04:51,980 --> 00:04:53,580
30,000. Deal?

100
00:04:53,580 --> 00:04:55,620
You're cutting way too much!

101
00:04:56,460 --> 00:04:58,020
No one haggles like that!

102
00:04:58,020 --> 00:04:58,660
Miss,

103
00:04:59,260 --> 00:05:01,340
we all know how this business works.

104
00:05:01,460 --> 00:05:03,100
You're still making a
profit at 30,000.

105
00:05:03,620 --> 00:05:04,140
Right?

106
00:05:08,180 --> 00:05:08,740
Fine.

107
00:05:09,340 --> 00:05:11,380
Since you're being
so filial to your mom,

108
00:05:12,300 --> 00:05:12,900
deal.

109
00:05:18,760 --> 00:05:20,660
And the jade bean comes
free with the bracelet.

110
00:05:20,660 --> 00:05:21,580
That's okay, right?

111
00:05:22,020 --> 00:05:22,940
Absolutely not.

112
00:05:23,220 --> 00:05:24,980
Young man, you're pushing it.

113
00:05:25,180 --> 00:05:26,520
Check online if you want.

114
00:05:26,540 --> 00:05:27,860
Our online

115
00:05:27,860 --> 00:05:29,660
and in-store prices are the same.

116
00:05:29,660 --> 00:05:30,910
There's barely any margin.

117
00:05:31,460 --> 00:05:32,260
Forget it then.

118
00:05:32,980 --> 00:05:35,020
Alright, alright, just pay.

119
00:05:37,100 --> 00:05:38,780
You are too good at haggling.

120
00:05:39,580 --> 00:05:41,180
I can't believe I ran into you.

121
00:05:41,980 --> 00:05:42,580
Miss,

122
00:05:43,340 --> 00:05:44,340
I'm not buying it today.

123
00:05:47,100 --> 00:05:49,140
So you've been messing with me, huh?

124
00:05:49,380 --> 00:05:50,820
Don't get upset.

125
00:05:51,540 --> 00:05:52,740
Let's call this a pre-order.

126
00:05:53,340 --> 00:05:55,020
We agree on the price today,

127
00:05:55,380 --> 00:05:56,740
I'll pay 1,000 yuan as a deposit,

128
00:05:57,140 --> 00:05:59,140
and I'll come back next week
to pick it up.

129
00:06:00,300 --> 00:06:01,260
No way.

130
00:06:01,260 --> 00:06:02,820
Definitely not.

131
00:06:02,820 --> 00:06:04,040
We don't do business like that.

132
00:06:04,140 --> 00:06:04,780
Miss,

133
00:06:05,620 --> 00:06:07,620
I know you're just an employee.

134
00:06:07,620 --> 00:06:08,740
It's not easy for you either.

135
00:06:09,660 --> 00:06:13,020
I just need you
to put the bracelet aside for me.

136
00:06:13,260 --> 00:06:14,580
So no one else buys it.

137
00:06:14,940 --> 00:06:15,900
If I don't come back

138
00:06:16,180 --> 00:06:17,380
to buy it in a week,

139
00:06:18,060 --> 00:06:19,860
you keep the thousand.

140
00:06:20,540 --> 00:06:21,540
If I do come back,

141
00:06:21,940 --> 00:06:23,460
think of it as a good-faith deposit,

142
00:06:24,140 --> 00:06:26,340
and the thousand still goes to you.

143
00:06:43,820 --> 00:06:44,620
Is Jiao asleep?

144
00:06:46,220 --> 00:06:48,500
Your daughter's essay today

145
00:06:48,500 --> 00:06:49,660
was really something else.

146
00:06:51,140 --> 00:06:51,900
What did she write?

147
00:06:53,460 --> 00:06:55,540
"If I had superpowers,

148
00:06:55,900 --> 00:06:57,900
I'd turn myself into
a puddle of useless mud.

149
00:06:58,660 --> 00:07:00,260
Don't ask me why.

150
00:07:00,700 --> 00:07:02,380
I just want to lie flat and rot."

151
00:07:03,540 --> 00:07:04,340
Her life philosophy

152
00:07:04,340 --> 00:07:05,860
is exactly the same as yours.

153
00:07:06,260 --> 00:07:07,380
Talented kid.

154
00:07:08,340 --> 00:07:10,420
You've got to let kids
express themselves,

155
00:07:10,420 --> 00:07:12,340
though, of course,
I don't endorse this attitude.

156
00:07:12,420 --> 00:07:14,300
On her behalf, my apologies, Xia.

157
00:07:14,700 --> 00:07:15,700
I'm sorry, Xia.

158
00:07:16,320 --> 00:07:17,300
Stop rubbing against me.

159
00:07:17,620 --> 00:07:18,300
Go to sleep.

160
00:07:29,480 --> 00:07:30,620
I need to tell you something.

161
00:07:30,620 --> 00:07:31,760
Promise me you won't get mad.

162
00:07:35,340 --> 00:07:36,700
Fine, I won't get mad.

163
00:07:36,820 --> 00:07:38,020
You're already mad.

164
00:07:38,030 --> 00:07:38,960
Tell me or not?

165
00:07:39,010 --> 00:07:40,240
I couldn't give him the liquor.

166
00:07:41,300 --> 00:07:42,060
Why?

167
00:07:42,860 --> 00:07:44,220
It's hard to get the liquor.

168
00:07:44,220 --> 00:07:45,420
How did you fail to deliver it?

169
00:07:45,420 --> 00:07:46,300
I did want to give.

170
00:07:46,300 --> 00:07:47,380
But giving gifts to boss

171
00:07:47,380 --> 00:07:48,660
in broad daylight at the office

172
00:07:48,660 --> 00:07:50,180
is basically getting him in trouble.

173
00:07:50,180 --> 00:07:52,500
Did I tell you to hand it
over in broad daylight?

174
00:07:52,860 --> 00:07:54,300
I said find the right moment.

175
00:07:54,300 --> 00:07:56,420
Do you even know what
"find the right moment" means?

176
00:07:56,860 --> 00:07:59,250
No wonder your daughter wants
to turn herself into a puddle of mud.

177
00:07:59,380 --> 00:08:00,380
I get it,

178
00:08:01,180 --> 00:08:01,940
but...

179
00:08:02,540 --> 00:08:04,300
Look, I really did
prepare well this time.

180
00:08:04,300 --> 00:08:07,380
I'll definitely make the shortlist,
even without bribing anyone. Trust me.

181
00:08:07,620 --> 00:08:08,580
Trust you?

182
00:08:10,020 --> 00:08:10,980
I'd sooner believe

183
00:08:10,980 --> 00:08:13,020
my brother will pay us back the money.

184
00:08:13,920 --> 00:08:15,420
Hey hey, comparing me to your brother?

185
00:08:15,420 --> 00:08:16,660
That's just rude.

186
00:08:17,940 --> 00:08:18,820
Am I wrong?

187
00:08:19,420 --> 00:08:22,140
At least Zhidong knows how
to work the upper channels.

188
00:08:22,140 --> 00:08:23,740
He knows how to ask my mom for help. You?

189
00:08:23,740 --> 00:08:25,430
You see your boss and
you run the other way.

190
00:08:25,440 --> 00:08:26,460
Getting you to give a gift

191
00:08:26,640 --> 00:08:28,460
is harder than asking
you to poison someone.

192
00:08:33,740 --> 00:08:35,100
If that's how you see it,

193
00:08:35,900 --> 00:08:37,700
I'll talk to your brother tomorrow.

194
00:08:38,420 --> 00:08:40,020
I'll make him sign an IOU,

195
00:08:40,100 --> 00:08:41,940
half of that 100k is
technically mine too.

196
00:08:44,300 --> 00:08:44,940
Zhang Hao!

197
00:08:45,260 --> 00:08:46,460
What's that supposed to mean?

198
00:08:47,540 --> 00:08:48,180
What did you say

199
00:08:48,180 --> 00:08:49,260
when you were pursuing me?

200
00:08:49,270 --> 00:08:50,860
Didn't you say,
"Your parents are my parents,

201
00:08:50,860 --> 00:08:52,140
your brother is my brother"?

202
00:08:52,150 --> 00:08:53,620
When you were pushing
for a second child,

203
00:08:53,620 --> 00:08:55,610
you said, "Blood is thicker than water,
siblings share a deep bond"!

204
00:08:55,620 --> 00:08:57,950
And now you're hunting
down my sibling for money? Seriously?

205
00:08:58,060 --> 00:08:59,140
Are you even a man?

206
00:09:02,340 --> 00:09:03,700
You're just asking for a scolding.

207
00:09:07,860 --> 00:09:08,740
Okay, I was wrong.

208
00:09:08,740 --> 00:09:10,100
Don't get agitated,
it's bad for the baby.

209
00:09:10,100 --> 00:09:10,860
I'm sorry, okay?

210
00:09:11,660 --> 00:09:12,260
Good night!

211
00:09:18,860 --> 00:09:19,500
Mr. Zhao!

212
00:09:19,920 --> 00:09:20,420
Here you go.

213
00:09:20,420 --> 00:09:21,180
Be careful.

214
00:09:21,180 --> 00:09:21,780
Okay.

215
00:09:23,180 --> 00:09:23,940
Morning, Mr. Hu.

216
00:09:24,140 --> 00:09:24,660
Morning.

217
00:09:24,670 --> 00:09:26,160
Moving all this stuff must be tiring.

218
00:09:26,420 --> 00:09:28,300
Money's hard to earn, life's tough.

219
00:09:30,420 --> 00:09:31,100
Mr. Hu,

220
00:09:31,780 --> 00:09:32,860
may I have a word with you?

221
00:09:36,300 --> 00:09:36,940
Look,

222
00:09:37,420 --> 00:09:38,820
our Shen's Chops are selling so well

223
00:09:38,820 --> 00:09:40,180
in the cafeteria.

224
00:09:40,380 --> 00:09:42,020
The students are loving it.

225
00:09:42,020 --> 00:09:43,460
Business is booming.

226
00:09:45,180 --> 00:09:48,180
So can we settle the bill a bit earlier?

227
00:09:50,620 --> 00:09:53,380
But the contract says
we settle once a month.

228
00:09:53,380 --> 00:09:55,420
That's what I told my dad too.

229
00:09:55,900 --> 00:09:57,460
A contract's a contract.

230
00:09:58,860 --> 00:10:00,140
But he's really struggling.

231
00:10:00,380 --> 00:10:02,780
Buying ingredients basically
wiped out our savings.

232
00:10:05,300 --> 00:10:06,220
I need to discuss this

233
00:10:06,340 --> 00:10:07,940
with Mr. Pan.

234
00:10:07,940 --> 00:10:08,660
It's fine, really.

235
00:10:08,860 --> 00:10:10,900
If the school can't
pay early, forget it.

236
00:10:11,220 --> 00:10:12,140
My dad said

237
00:10:13,060 --> 00:10:15,220
he could set up a stall
outside the school gate.

238
00:10:16,280 --> 00:10:17,950
If students can't
buy it in the cafeteria,

239
00:10:18,060 --> 00:10:19,060
they'll buy it there.

240
00:10:20,180 --> 00:10:21,820
That way he gets cash flow.

241
00:10:22,360 --> 00:10:23,060
You get it, right?

242
00:10:23,420 --> 00:10:24,620
But stalls aren't allowed.

243
00:10:24,620 --> 00:10:25,780
He'll be outside the gate.

244
00:10:25,780 --> 00:10:27,540
Students can't go out.

245
00:10:27,540 --> 00:10:29,650
He's got a clothes pole.
He'll just pass it through.

246
00:10:30,740 --> 00:10:31,700
It'll be chaotic.

247
00:10:31,700 --> 00:10:33,140
I'm concerned too.

248
00:10:35,540 --> 00:10:36,220
So, Mr. Hu,

249
00:10:37,140 --> 00:10:38,140
could you please

250
00:10:38,780 --> 00:10:40,580
talk to Mr. Pan?

251
00:10:40,900 --> 00:10:41,940
Just this once,

252
00:10:42,740 --> 00:10:43,840
settle the payment earlier.

253
00:10:44,380 --> 00:10:45,420
My dad will be relieved,

254
00:10:45,860 --> 00:10:46,860
and we'll all be happy.

255
00:10:48,300 --> 00:10:50,260
Just this once. No next time.

256
00:10:53,180 --> 00:10:53,860
Alright.

257
00:10:54,100 --> 00:10:56,540
I'll go talk to Mr. Pan now.

258
00:10:56,600 --> 00:10:57,380
I'm counting on you.

259
00:10:58,220 --> 00:10:59,060
Wait for my update.

260
00:11:01,300 --> 00:11:02,620
Waiting on your good news, Mr. Hu.

261
00:11:05,820 --> 00:11:07,420
He can't even make the call.

262
00:11:12,060 --> 00:11:15,180
(Nanzhou High School)

263
00:11:29,620 --> 00:11:30,300
Lu Bing!

264
00:11:33,100 --> 00:11:33,900
Shen Minghui!

265
00:11:35,500 --> 00:11:37,660
(Nanzhou High School)

266
00:11:40,540 --> 00:11:41,100
Miss.

267
00:11:41,380 --> 00:11:42,940
You really came, young man.

268
00:11:45,060 --> 00:11:46,220
I saved them for you.

269
00:11:46,980 --> 00:11:47,540
Take a look.

270
00:11:50,220 --> 00:11:51,460
And the bracelets too.

271
00:11:52,660 --> 00:11:54,020
I'm going to print you the receipt.

272
00:11:54,020 --> 00:11:54,580
Alright!

273
00:12:05,780 --> 00:12:06,820
We'd like another stir-fry.

274
00:12:06,820 --> 00:12:07,380
And one of those too.

275
00:12:07,380 --> 00:12:08,620
Huaiyang-style stir-fry.

276
00:12:08,620 --> 00:12:09,220
Yes.

277
00:12:09,420 --> 00:12:10,780
It's so warm today.

278
00:12:11,060 --> 00:12:11,700
Yes.

279
00:12:12,020 --> 00:12:12,980
I keep sweating.

280
00:12:13,740 --> 00:12:15,580
Your jade bracelets are so beautiful.

281
00:12:15,620 --> 00:12:16,740
They must be expensive.

282
00:12:17,620 --> 00:12:19,500
Not at all, only 30,000.

283
00:12:19,500 --> 00:12:20,340
30,000!

284
00:12:20,340 --> 00:12:21,460
And that's "not expensive"?

285
00:12:21,780 --> 00:12:23,140
And it's a pair.

286
00:12:23,140 --> 00:12:23,940
Mrs. Shen,

287
00:12:24,140 --> 00:12:25,260
you're doing so well!

288
00:12:25,940 --> 00:12:27,140
Let me tell you,

289
00:12:27,140 --> 00:12:27,780
actually,

290
00:12:27,780 --> 00:12:29,220
I kept saying I didn't need it.

291
00:12:29,220 --> 00:12:30,860
But the kid insisted
on buying it for me!

292
00:12:31,540 --> 00:12:32,220
I said no,

293
00:12:32,220 --> 00:12:33,220
but my son was adamant.

294
00:12:34,020 --> 00:12:35,580
He said, "Look at other families,

295
00:12:35,580 --> 00:12:37,540
they all have heirlooms.
Our family doesn't."

296
00:12:37,540 --> 00:12:38,750
He just had to get them for me.

297
00:12:38,760 --> 00:12:40,180
Such filial kid! So filial!

298
00:12:40,780 --> 00:12:41,380
Nonsense.

299
00:12:41,380 --> 00:12:42,740
He keeps driving me crazy.

300
00:12:42,740 --> 00:12:43,780
Let's add two more dishes,

301
00:12:43,780 --> 00:12:44,380
and a soup.

302
00:12:44,380 --> 00:12:46,140
We'll bring you our three-delicacy soup.

303
00:12:57,260 --> 00:12:58,660
Mr. Hu, come in.

304
00:12:58,980 --> 00:12:59,780
Never mind.

305
00:12:59,780 --> 00:13:00,980
I have to rush back to school.

306
00:13:01,060 --> 00:13:02,380
I know you're off today.

307
00:13:02,380 --> 00:13:03,580
I didn't want to wake you,

308
00:13:03,580 --> 00:13:04,740
so I didn't call.

309
00:13:05,260 --> 00:13:06,900
I grabbed a serving of the Shen's Chop

310
00:13:06,900 --> 00:13:08,140
from our cafeteria for you.

311
00:13:08,460 --> 00:13:09,740
You can have it as a snack later.

312
00:13:12,100 --> 00:13:13,620
Shen Mingzhu is my sister-in-law.

313
00:13:13,620 --> 00:13:14,850
I can eat that any time I want.

314
00:13:16,100 --> 00:13:17,780
Their production can't
keep up right now.

315
00:13:17,780 --> 00:13:19,700
They're supplying
everything to our cafeteria.

316
00:13:19,700 --> 00:13:20,980
You can't buy it anywhere else.

317
00:13:21,140 --> 00:13:22,180
I said I can, so I can.

318
00:13:23,420 --> 00:13:24,980
We should be realistic about this.

319
00:13:25,660 --> 00:13:26,980
Fine, fine, let's be realistic.

320
00:13:28,260 --> 00:13:30,140
Well, I don't feel like chops today.

321
00:13:30,540 --> 00:13:31,340
They're too greasy.

322
00:13:32,380 --> 00:13:33,140
Well, then,

323
00:13:33,860 --> 00:13:35,220
what would you like to eat today?

324
00:13:36,220 --> 00:13:37,060
I want

325
00:13:37,840 --> 00:13:38,620
that mung bean cake

326
00:13:38,620 --> 00:13:40,100
from the shop outside your school.

327
00:13:40,100 --> 00:13:41,380
Go line up and buy me a box.

328
00:13:44,500 --> 00:13:45,660
There's no time now.

329
00:13:45,900 --> 00:13:46,620
I...

330
00:13:46,780 --> 00:13:48,340
I can bring it to you tonight, okay?

331
00:13:48,340 --> 00:13:50,300
No. I want it now.

332
00:13:51,060 --> 00:13:52,300
I have class this afternoon.

333
00:13:52,300 --> 00:13:54,060
- I really can't make it.
- I want it now.

334
00:13:54,420 --> 00:13:55,540
Yes or no?

335
00:13:57,180 --> 00:13:59,260
No. I really do have class
this afternoon.

336
00:14:00,540 --> 00:14:01,140
Alright then.

337
00:14:02,260 --> 00:14:03,220
Go to class.

338
00:14:03,220 --> 00:14:04,280
And take the chop with you.

339
00:14:04,290 --> 00:14:05,760
Don't bother coming to find me again.

340
00:14:06,020 --> 00:14:06,340
Get out.

341
00:14:52,460 --> 00:14:53,980
He really left.

342
00:15:01,180 --> 00:15:01,940
Class,

343
00:15:02,260 --> 00:15:04,060
when you get a problem like this,

344
00:15:04,070 --> 00:15:06,120
the first thing you need
to do is read it carefully.

345
00:15:06,780 --> 00:15:07,780
Think about

346
00:15:08,020 --> 00:15:10,460
what hidden conditions
are inside the problem.

347
00:15:10,860 --> 00:15:13,420
For example, if it's uniform
linear motion,

348
00:15:14,300 --> 00:15:17,660
that tells you the net
external force is zero.

349
00:15:18,340 --> 00:15:19,660
If it's projectile motion,

350
00:15:19,660 --> 00:15:20,960
that implies the velocity in

351
00:15:20,960 --> 00:15:22,620
the vertical direction
remains constant...

352
00:15:24,260 --> 00:15:25,580
No, no,

353
00:15:25,980 --> 00:15:27,180
not the vertical direction.

354
00:15:27,380 --> 00:15:30,220
It's the horizontal direction where
the velocity remains constant.

355
00:15:30,480 --> 00:15:32,700
Okay, class, you may begin analyzing
the problem now.

356
00:15:32,700 --> 00:15:34,280
Then you can start writing your answers.

357
00:15:48,700 --> 00:15:49,620
Go to class.

358
00:15:49,630 --> 00:15:51,160
Don't bother coming to find me again.

359
00:15:56,780 --> 00:16:02,180
(Physics)

360
00:16:18,340 --> 00:16:20,180
I'm telling you, Yu Jingxiang,

361
00:16:20,620 --> 00:16:23,300
no matter how you calculate it,
the money isn't enough.

362
00:16:25,540 --> 00:16:26,660
Whether it's enough or not,

363
00:16:26,940 --> 00:16:27,820
let me be clear,

364
00:16:28,020 --> 00:16:31,780
that 200,000 is absolutely untouchable.

365
00:16:31,790 --> 00:16:33,300
That bride price money is set in stone.

366
00:16:33,300 --> 00:16:34,740
It stays right where it is.

367
00:16:34,740 --> 00:16:36,340
Alright, alright, I know.

368
00:16:36,660 --> 00:16:38,820
Do what you can with what you have,

369
00:16:39,340 --> 00:16:39,900
right?

370
00:16:40,100 --> 00:16:42,420
If we don't have much, then
we just buy cheaper stuff.

371
00:16:43,740 --> 00:16:44,660
Xu Dacheng,

372
00:16:44,940 --> 00:16:45,940
buy cheaper stuff?

373
00:16:46,260 --> 00:16:47,340
Your son is getting married

374
00:16:47,660 --> 00:16:49,020
and you want to cheap out?

375
00:16:50,980 --> 00:16:52,500
What's really worrying me right now is

376
00:16:52,500 --> 00:16:54,560
how on earth are we going
to pay back that 100,000?

377
00:16:57,300 --> 00:16:57,940
Well...

378
00:16:58,580 --> 00:17:00,740
Zhixia lent the money to help Zhidong

379
00:17:00,740 --> 00:17:02,380
pay the bride price,

380
00:17:02,380 --> 00:17:03,140
right?

381
00:17:03,710 --> 00:17:05,580
So naturally he should
be the one to return it.

382
00:17:05,580 --> 00:17:06,860
Why would we be paying it back?

383
00:17:06,940 --> 00:17:08,900
Listen to yourself.

384
00:17:09,060 --> 00:17:10,140
You think he'll pay it back?

385
00:17:10,150 --> 00:17:12,500
Have you ever seen a single
cent that boy has brought home?

386
00:17:12,500 --> 00:17:14,780
Since he started working,
have you seen even one?

387
00:17:16,260 --> 00:17:17,660
What's he going

388
00:17:17,740 --> 00:17:18,540
to use to repay her?

389
00:17:18,680 --> 00:17:20,620
You think he'll get rich
after getting married?

390
00:17:20,980 --> 00:17:22,780
Just magically whips out 100,000?

391
00:17:22,780 --> 00:17:24,180
You think getting married

392
00:17:24,180 --> 00:17:24,900
means what?

393
00:17:24,900 --> 00:17:26,860
That he'll strike it rich?
Become a millionaire?

394
00:17:28,340 --> 00:17:29,100
Well, what do you

395
00:17:29,580 --> 00:17:30,220
suggest then?

396
00:17:30,220 --> 00:17:31,900
I only have one request,

397
00:17:33,260 --> 00:17:36,220
have our son write Zhixia an IOU.

398
00:17:36,340 --> 00:17:37,900
Are you out of your mind?

399
00:17:38,100 --> 00:17:41,300
They're siblings.

400
00:17:41,300 --> 00:17:42,500
That's ridiculous!

401
00:17:43,380 --> 00:17:44,580
Come on, Xu Dacheng,

402
00:17:44,580 --> 00:17:45,780
you just...

403
00:17:45,780 --> 00:17:47,100
You don't understand.

404
00:17:49,420 --> 00:17:51,500
Paying back the money is one thing.

405
00:17:52,300 --> 00:17:55,340
Having an IOU is another.

406
00:17:55,660 --> 00:17:56,980
We owe that girl

407
00:17:56,980 --> 00:17:58,020
that assurance.

408
00:17:58,020 --> 00:17:58,660
And besides,

409
00:17:59,340 --> 00:18:01,020
your son needs pressure.

410
00:18:01,020 --> 00:18:01,820
You hear me?

411
00:18:03,780 --> 00:18:05,300
Put that way, it does make sense.

412
00:18:05,900 --> 00:18:06,940
Make the boy write it.

413
00:18:07,100 --> 00:18:07,980
Exactly!

414
00:18:09,180 --> 00:18:11,340
Kid needs a little push.

415
00:18:13,220 --> 00:18:13,860
Mingzhu.

416
00:18:15,460 --> 00:18:16,220
Hi, Zhixia.

417
00:18:19,900 --> 00:18:21,300
I ordered you an orange juice.

418
00:18:22,300 --> 00:18:23,380
And I've picked the dishes.

419
00:18:26,460 --> 00:18:27,700
This is for you, Zhixia.

420
00:18:28,420 --> 00:18:29,100
What is it?

421
00:18:29,700 --> 00:18:31,780
That article you wrote
for our hotel last time,

422
00:18:31,780 --> 00:18:32,740
"A Century of Nanxi."

423
00:18:33,060 --> 00:18:34,900
It worked wonders.

424
00:18:35,460 --> 00:18:37,900
We've been booking a
ton of weddings lately.

425
00:18:37,900 --> 00:18:39,740
Even Dr. Li's uncle decided to

426
00:18:39,740 --> 00:18:41,050
hold his birthday banquet with us.

427
00:18:41,130 --> 00:18:42,020
The boss was so pleased

428
00:18:42,020 --> 00:18:43,660
he approved 5,000 yuan for publicity

429
00:18:43,660 --> 00:18:44,820
and wants another article.

430
00:18:46,500 --> 00:18:48,340
Your boss is really stingy.

431
00:18:48,820 --> 00:18:51,180
5,000 isn't nearly enough.

432
00:18:52,460 --> 00:18:53,220
It's not?

433
00:18:53,900 --> 00:18:56,580
But since he sent you to talk to me,

434
00:18:57,060 --> 00:18:58,020
I'll do it for free.

435
00:19:01,340 --> 00:19:02,300
Just teasing you.

436
00:19:03,690 --> 00:19:05,860
Hello, your stir-fried beef
with yellow peppers. Enjoy.

437
00:19:05,860 --> 00:19:06,700
Thank you.

438
00:19:07,180 --> 00:19:08,620
The food's here, let's eat.

439
00:19:08,780 --> 00:19:10,780
I ordered papaya with snow frog for us.

440
00:19:10,780 --> 00:19:12,180
We both need the nourishment.

441
00:19:14,100 --> 00:19:15,860
I brought you some
of our family's chops.

442
00:19:15,980 --> 00:19:18,220
You can just heat them up tonight.

443
00:19:18,780 --> 00:19:20,580
You know, my brother
started selling these

444
00:19:20,580 --> 00:19:22,140
at his school cafeteria,

445
00:19:22,140 --> 00:19:23,340
and they're a huge hit.

446
00:19:23,340 --> 00:19:24,500
I heard.

447
00:19:24,780 --> 00:19:26,580
Your brother is pretty smart.

448
00:19:26,900 --> 00:19:27,780
Your brother is...

449
00:19:28,340 --> 00:19:29,580
He's also quite filial.

450
00:19:29,780 --> 00:19:30,980
"Filial," my foot!

451
00:19:30,980 --> 00:19:31,620
For his wedding,

452
00:19:31,620 --> 00:19:33,120
he drained my parents' life savings

453
00:19:33,120 --> 00:19:34,460
and even borrowed 100,000 from me.

454
00:19:34,460 --> 00:19:35,950
Who knows if I'll ever
see that money again.

455
00:19:38,620 --> 00:19:39,580
Don't worry.

456
00:19:40,020 --> 00:19:41,780
Xu Zhidong wouldn't
borrow money from you.

457
00:19:42,340 --> 00:19:44,260
He only leeches off people named Xu.

458
00:19:47,100 --> 00:19:48,500
Here, have some more.

459
00:19:51,020 --> 00:19:53,780
Zhidong, there are so many wedding
candy box options online.

460
00:19:53,780 --> 00:19:55,640
There's really no need to go all
the way to the wholesale market.

461
00:19:58,140 --> 00:20:00,380
You really think my Mom went
there to buy wedding candy?

462
00:20:00,390 --> 00:20:01,950
She went because she
wanted to "accidentally"

463
00:20:02,500 --> 00:20:03,660
bump into Mingzhu.

464
00:20:06,340 --> 00:20:07,940
So, is Mingzhu coming to our wedding?

465
00:20:08,060 --> 00:20:09,060
No one knows for sure.

466
00:20:12,060 --> 00:20:13,300
Here, try this crispy duck.

467
00:20:13,700 --> 00:20:14,580
It's pretty good.

468
00:20:14,860 --> 00:20:16,580
Take a portion home for your parents.

469
00:20:16,780 --> 00:20:17,380
Two portions.

470
00:20:17,860 --> 00:20:19,220
Bring some for your parents too.

471
00:20:19,700 --> 00:20:20,940
They've been really good to me.

472
00:20:23,900 --> 00:20:24,940
Thank you.

473
00:20:37,100 --> 00:20:37,820
This is good tea.

474
00:20:38,180 --> 00:20:40,100
The tea the Xu family gave us
is quite nice.

475
00:20:41,020 --> 00:20:42,860
A box of tea is all it
takes to win you over?

476
00:20:43,580 --> 00:20:44,460
Let me tell you,

477
00:20:44,500 --> 00:20:45,700
I asked around.

478
00:20:46,060 --> 00:20:48,380
There's no such tradition
in Yujia Village

479
00:20:48,380 --> 00:20:51,020
about giving the bride
price at a wedding eve party.

480
00:20:53,820 --> 00:20:55,140
I know.

481
00:20:56,420 --> 00:20:57,220
You know?

482
00:20:58,420 --> 00:21:00,020
And you still covered for them?

483
00:21:00,020 --> 00:21:00,620
Alright now.

484
00:21:01,380 --> 00:21:03,420
You know how much our daughter

485
00:21:03,420 --> 00:21:04,580
loves Zhidong.

486
00:21:05,180 --> 00:21:05,860
Besides,

487
00:21:06,220 --> 00:21:07,540
Zhidong is a decent boy,

488
00:21:07,540 --> 00:21:08,380
just like me.

489
00:21:09,300 --> 00:21:12,100
These things take time when two
families are discussing a marriage.

490
00:21:12,700 --> 00:21:13,900
If you make a scene

491
00:21:13,900 --> 00:21:14,980
and sour things,

492
00:21:15,480 --> 00:21:17,360
aren't you just making
it harder for the kids?

493
00:21:17,780 --> 00:21:18,620
Sure, sure,

494
00:21:19,140 --> 00:21:20,660
you get to be the good guy.

495
00:21:20,980 --> 00:21:22,860
Makes me look like all I do is scheme.

496
00:21:26,100 --> 00:21:28,700
What really bothers me is
the excuse they're giving.

497
00:21:31,620 --> 00:21:33,020
I keep thinking about it.

498
00:21:33,780 --> 00:21:35,620
Are they short on money?

499
00:21:36,820 --> 00:21:37,740
It can't be that.

500
00:21:37,980 --> 00:21:39,020
They already agreed to it.

501
00:21:39,540 --> 00:21:40,780
It's just a matter of time.

502
00:21:41,860 --> 00:21:42,660
I'm telling you,

503
00:21:43,140 --> 00:21:45,340
Chen's future
mother-in-law seems shrewd.

504
00:21:46,060 --> 00:21:49,420
I'm really worried our daughter will
get taken advantage of in that family.

505
00:21:52,820 --> 00:21:53,700
Mom, dad.

506
00:21:54,100 --> 00:21:55,980
I brought you some crispy duck.

507
00:21:57,060 --> 00:21:57,740
It's still warm.

508
00:21:57,980 --> 00:21:58,860
Eat it while it's hot.

509
00:21:59,660 --> 00:22:01,180
Is eating

510
00:22:01,180 --> 00:22:03,660
all you ever think about?

511
00:22:04,980 --> 00:22:06,460
It's from Chen. She bought it for you.

512
00:22:07,740 --> 00:22:08,500
Xu Zhidong.

513
00:22:10,780 --> 00:22:11,940
Let me ask you something.

514
00:22:13,940 --> 00:22:16,180
How are you planning to pay back

515
00:22:16,940 --> 00:22:18,660
the 100,000 your sister borrowed you?

516
00:22:19,900 --> 00:22:20,660
How?

517
00:22:21,540 --> 00:22:22,340
In installments.

518
00:22:24,140 --> 00:22:26,740
Write her an IOU then.

519
00:22:27,820 --> 00:22:28,860
Is that necessary?

520
00:22:28,860 --> 00:22:30,320
It's not like I'm going to stiff her.

521
00:22:30,620 --> 00:22:31,500
Just write it.

522
00:22:32,020 --> 00:22:33,260
You should write it.

523
00:22:33,460 --> 00:22:35,620
It's better to keep things clear
even between siblings.

524
00:22:36,060 --> 00:22:37,180
After you write it,

525
00:22:37,180 --> 00:22:39,340
your sister probably won't
press you too hard about it.

526
00:22:39,340 --> 00:22:40,940
Your dad's right.

527
00:22:41,420 --> 00:22:42,500
He's right.

528
00:22:42,500 --> 00:22:44,300
Your sister has her own family now,

529
00:22:44,420 --> 00:22:45,900
her own responsibilities.

530
00:22:46,020 --> 00:22:47,950
We, as her birth family,
need to be considerate.

531
00:22:48,260 --> 00:22:49,340
We shouldn't act like

532
00:22:49,340 --> 00:22:50,620
she's obligated to us.

533
00:22:51,420 --> 00:22:53,220
Alright, we're getting all serious now.

534
00:22:53,420 --> 00:22:54,300
I'll write it.

535
00:22:58,860 --> 00:23:00,180
Once you're done,

536
00:23:00,700 --> 00:23:03,900
take that IOU to Zhixia

537
00:23:04,460 --> 00:23:05,820
and thank her properly.

538
00:23:05,820 --> 00:23:07,220
Got it.

539
00:23:07,220 --> 00:23:08,780
(IOU: I, Xu Zhidong, owe Xu Zhixia...)

540
00:23:10,020 --> 00:23:10,580
Okay.

541
00:23:12,300 --> 00:23:14,390
I'm going to Guangzhou
for a business trip next week.

542
00:23:14,980 --> 00:23:16,060
Who are you going with?

543
00:23:16,860 --> 00:23:17,940
Employees from the company.

544
00:23:18,220 --> 00:23:19,500
I'll prepare your pills.

545
00:23:19,500 --> 00:23:20,740
Remember to take them on time.

546
00:23:21,220 --> 00:23:21,940
Don't forget it.

547
00:23:21,940 --> 00:23:23,220
- Okay.
- And no liquor.

548
00:23:23,780 --> 00:23:25,020
Thank you, Mrs. Feng.

549
00:23:25,780 --> 00:23:26,460
Mom, dad.

550
00:23:26,710 --> 00:23:27,540
You're here, Mingzhu.

551
00:23:27,540 --> 00:23:28,380
Come, Mingzhu.

552
00:23:28,780 --> 00:23:29,340
Hurry.

553
00:23:29,340 --> 00:23:30,460
Come sit here.

554
00:23:30,460 --> 00:23:31,140
Mingzhu,

555
00:23:31,740 --> 00:23:32,660
that plate of greens

556
00:23:32,660 --> 00:23:33,860
is for you.

557
00:23:33,860 --> 00:23:34,580
Finish it.

558
00:23:35,060 --> 00:23:36,380
It's good for the baby's eyes.

559
00:23:37,100 --> 00:23:38,660
Don't force her.

560
00:23:38,660 --> 00:23:39,780
Please help yourselves.

561
00:23:42,660 --> 00:23:43,540
I'm going to work.

562
00:23:43,560 --> 00:23:44,140
What about your breakfast?

563
00:23:44,140 --> 00:23:45,150
Have some breakfast first.

564
00:23:45,620 --> 00:23:46,420
I'll pass.

565
00:23:47,940 --> 00:23:49,820
How come Mr. Hu hasn't been coming by

566
00:23:49,820 --> 00:23:51,540
to pick you up lately?

567
00:23:53,820 --> 00:23:55,100
Who needs him to?

568
00:23:55,940 --> 00:23:57,380
That rickety electric bike of his

569
00:23:57,380 --> 00:23:58,740
kicks up so much dust

570
00:23:58,740 --> 00:23:59,820
it ruins my makeup!

571
00:24:00,620 --> 00:24:01,740
Did you have a fight?

572
00:24:03,200 --> 00:24:04,060
He doesn't deserve me.

573
00:24:04,300 --> 00:24:05,220
Watch your tone.

574
00:24:06,060 --> 00:24:07,220
We didn't fight.

575
00:24:07,580 --> 00:24:08,740
I just think he's

576
00:24:08,980 --> 00:24:10,940
like a block of wood. So boring.

577
00:24:11,280 --> 00:24:12,380
I have so many guys chasing me,

578
00:24:12,380 --> 00:24:14,080
why should I settle for someone
so boring?

579
00:24:14,260 --> 00:24:14,980
Let me tell you,

580
00:24:14,980 --> 00:24:16,900
I think Mr. Hu is actually pretty good.

581
00:24:16,900 --> 00:24:17,500
Yes.

582
00:24:17,940 --> 00:24:18,900
He's educated,

583
00:24:18,900 --> 00:24:21,420
he can fix light bulbs, set up the Wi-Fi.

584
00:24:21,580 --> 00:24:22,700
He's a great guy.

585
00:24:22,780 --> 00:24:23,940
He's like an electrician.

586
00:24:24,220 --> 00:24:25,460
- Meiqi.
- Listen to yourself.

587
00:24:25,620 --> 00:24:27,220
You might have a lot of suitors,

588
00:24:27,620 --> 00:24:28,780
but how many of them

589
00:24:28,780 --> 00:24:30,860
are as steady and reliable as Hu?

590
00:24:31,180 --> 00:24:32,260
Don't be cocky.

591
00:24:32,270 --> 00:24:32,780
That's right.

592
00:24:32,780 --> 00:24:34,950
You'll regret it if you let
someone like that slip away.

593
00:24:35,260 --> 00:24:36,380
See?

594
00:24:36,740 --> 00:24:39,100
Even Mingzhu and your dad
think he's good.

595
00:24:39,250 --> 00:24:40,100
Say whatever you want.

596
00:24:40,110 --> 00:24:40,930
Just leave me alone.

597
00:24:45,660 --> 00:24:46,820
You spoiled her too much.

598
00:24:47,260 --> 00:24:48,300
Don't mind her. Let's eat.

599
00:24:48,540 --> 00:24:49,100
Here.

600
00:25:03,700 --> 00:25:04,620
What?

601
00:25:05,900 --> 00:25:07,420
Meiqi dumped Hu Gang?

602
00:25:08,320 --> 00:25:09,240
Seems like it.

603
00:25:09,660 --> 00:25:12,180
But I don't think Meiqi
has really moved on.

604
00:25:12,190 --> 00:25:13,220
She's just being stubborn,

605
00:25:13,230 --> 00:25:14,740
waiting for Hu Gang to beg her back.

606
00:25:15,740 --> 00:25:16,940
And did he?

607
00:25:17,300 --> 00:25:18,220
Doesn't look like it.

608
00:25:19,220 --> 00:25:20,460
Good for him.

609
00:25:22,460 --> 00:25:23,860
So that means

610
00:25:25,260 --> 00:25:27,500
Mr. Hu is now available?

611
00:25:29,380 --> 00:25:30,420
What are you getting at?

612
00:25:31,660 --> 00:25:32,540
Come on,

613
00:25:33,100 --> 00:25:34,960
you talk about Hu Gang all the time.

614
00:25:34,960 --> 00:25:37,360
I've heard his name so much
he practically feels like an old friend.

615
00:25:37,860 --> 00:25:39,540
And I think he actually suits me.

616
00:25:39,580 --> 00:25:40,900
I'm going to steal him away.

617
00:25:40,900 --> 00:25:42,500
That'll take Princess Meiqi down a peg.

618
00:25:43,060 --> 00:25:44,500
What nonsense is that?

619
00:25:44,500 --> 00:25:46,140
They haven't even officially broken up.

620
00:25:46,140 --> 00:25:47,340
Don't get involved.

621
00:25:47,780 --> 00:25:49,940
Whether she's over him is her business.

622
00:25:49,940 --> 00:25:51,500
Hu Gang didn't even try to get her back.

623
00:25:52,340 --> 00:25:54,900
A moment like this
is a perfect time for me to swoop in.

624
00:25:54,900 --> 00:25:56,020
Hu Gang's a grown man.

625
00:25:56,020 --> 00:25:57,060
He can choose for himself.

626
00:25:57,640 --> 00:25:58,900
And you think he'll choose you?

627
00:26:01,860 --> 00:26:02,580
Just wait and see.

628
00:26:05,740 --> 00:26:06,300
Meiqi,

629
00:26:06,300 --> 00:26:07,100
I'm going home.

630
00:26:07,100 --> 00:26:08,100
- Bye bye.
- Bye bye.

631
00:26:08,500 --> 00:26:09,180
Bye bye.

632
00:26:10,940 --> 00:26:11,580
Meiqi.

633
00:26:11,900 --> 00:26:12,780
Are you free tonight?

634
00:26:12,900 --> 00:26:14,780
My friend opened a gallery
in the old town

635
00:26:14,900 --> 00:26:15,860
and asked me to stop by.

636
00:26:16,100 --> 00:26:17,480
Would you be interested in coming?

637
00:26:19,540 --> 00:26:20,180
Sure.

638
00:26:20,980 --> 00:26:22,300
But I can't be out too late.

639
00:26:22,300 --> 00:26:23,340
It won't be late.

640
00:26:23,340 --> 00:26:25,300
We'll just look at
the interesting paintings

641
00:26:25,380 --> 00:26:26,780
and grab a quick bite.

642
00:26:27,260 --> 00:26:27,820
Sure.

643
00:26:29,860 --> 00:26:31,540
Let's go via Nanzhou High School then.

644
00:26:31,540 --> 00:26:33,570
There's a shop near there that
sells really good mung bean cakes.

645
00:26:33,580 --> 00:26:35,060
Sounds good. I'd like to try them.

646
00:26:35,060 --> 00:26:36,180
Okay. We'll take my car.

647
00:26:36,380 --> 00:26:37,020
Sure.

648
00:26:48,340 --> 00:26:49,060
It's that one.

649
00:26:49,340 --> 00:26:50,580
Okay, I'll get in line.

650
00:26:50,700 --> 00:26:51,260
Okay.

651
00:27:03,620 --> 00:27:04,340
Steven.

652
00:27:04,640 --> 00:27:06,140
Thank you for waiting in line for me.

653
00:27:06,460 --> 00:27:08,140
Of course. It's my pleasure.

654
00:27:12,340 --> 00:27:13,660
Their other pastries are good too.

655
00:27:13,660 --> 00:27:15,940
Should we buy some for your friend?

656
00:27:27,300 --> 00:27:28,340
(There's nothing I can do.)

657
00:27:28,940 --> 00:27:30,380
(I guess I should just back off.)

658
00:27:46,580 --> 00:27:50,380
(Shen's Restaurant)

659
00:28:20,340 --> 00:28:23,300
Shen Family peanuts,
Shen Family dried tofu.

660
00:28:23,620 --> 00:28:24,380
Please try them.

661
00:28:26,140 --> 00:28:27,700
Lu Family's college entrance exam tips.

662
00:28:28,140 --> 00:28:28,980
Please take a look.

663
00:28:31,060 --> 00:28:33,860
Let's work hard and
get into the same university!

664
00:28:43,900 --> 00:28:44,820
Yes!

665
00:29:12,540 --> 00:29:13,540
Pass it to her.

666
00:29:22,020 --> 00:29:24,180
(Hey, you're hitting the jackpot
by picking me)

667
00:29:24,560 --> 00:29:25,330
"Hey,

668
00:29:25,960 --> 00:29:27,620
you're hitting the jackpot
by picking me"

669
00:29:30,100 --> 00:29:30,780
Shen Minghui.

670
00:29:32,060 --> 00:29:32,620
Yes, sir.

671
00:29:34,980 --> 00:29:36,060
Who is this supposed to be?

672
00:29:36,180 --> 00:29:37,060
Mr. Sun,

673
00:29:37,900 --> 00:29:38,540
it's me.

674
00:29:40,780 --> 00:29:42,340
You drew yourself quite handsome, huh?

675
00:29:42,980 --> 00:29:43,900
Thanks, Mr. Sun.

676
00:29:48,360 --> 00:29:50,280
(Hey, you're hitting the jackpot
by picking me)

677
00:29:51,460 --> 00:29:52,540
And who is this "Hey" for?

678
00:29:53,540 --> 00:29:54,220
I don't know.

679
00:29:57,620 --> 00:29:58,420
You don't know?

680
00:29:59,180 --> 00:30:00,300
What do you know?

681
00:30:00,540 --> 00:30:01,820
You clearly don't know anything!

682
00:30:02,060 --> 00:30:02,820
Forget it then!

683
00:30:02,820 --> 00:30:03,920
Pack your bag and go home!

684
00:30:04,180 --> 00:30:04,980
Mr. Sun.

685
00:30:04,980 --> 00:30:05,580
What?

686
00:30:06,980 --> 00:30:09,580
That "hey"

687
00:30:10,180 --> 00:30:10,780
is for me.

688
00:30:17,320 --> 00:30:18,660
(For Mr. Sun Lei of Nanzhou High School)

689
00:30:18,660 --> 00:30:20,250
(A teacher's effort
yields brilliant success.)

690
00:30:41,860 --> 00:30:42,620
Lu Bing,

691
00:30:43,220 --> 00:30:45,220
why did you repeat your final year?

692
00:30:46,060 --> 00:30:48,540
Wasn't it to aim for Tsinghua
or Peking University this time?

693
00:30:48,820 --> 00:30:51,100
You're our star student!

694
00:30:51,100 --> 00:30:52,980
Shen Minghui is just a lost cause!

695
00:30:52,980 --> 00:30:53,660
Sir,

696
00:30:54,340 --> 00:30:56,420
Shen Minghui has many
good qualities too.

697
00:30:56,780 --> 00:30:59,540
We shouldn't just label people.

698
00:30:59,780 --> 00:31:00,540
Fine, fine.

699
00:31:01,380 --> 00:31:02,460
No labels.

700
00:31:03,100 --> 00:31:04,620
Let's just look at the facts, alright?

701
00:31:05,070 --> 00:31:07,140
Shen Minghui has been
in high school for five years.

702
00:31:07,140 --> 00:31:08,180
Is that a fact?

703
00:31:09,220 --> 00:31:11,020
All Shen Minghui thinks about

704
00:31:11,020 --> 00:31:12,140
is business and making money.

705
00:31:12,260 --> 00:31:13,500
He doesn't focus on his studies.

706
00:31:13,500 --> 00:31:14,620
Is that a fact?

707
00:31:15,580 --> 00:31:16,780
Just think about it.

708
00:31:17,020 --> 00:31:19,420
You've studied hard for years.

709
00:31:19,500 --> 00:31:20,900
You're this close to making it.

710
00:31:21,140 --> 00:31:22,780
Sir, I will focus on my studies.

711
00:31:23,060 --> 00:31:23,660
This won't do.

712
00:31:23,820 --> 00:31:25,380
Have your father

713
00:31:25,620 --> 00:31:26,620
come to school tomorrow.

714
00:31:35,660 --> 00:31:36,260
Lu Bing.

715
00:31:38,380 --> 00:31:40,380
Your father doesn't
have to come tomorrow,

716
00:31:40,860 --> 00:31:42,900
but you must promise me one thing.

717
00:31:44,100 --> 00:31:45,620
Before the college entrance exam,

718
00:31:45,860 --> 00:31:47,740
you stay far, far away
from that Shen Minghui.

719
00:31:47,740 --> 00:31:48,660
Can you do it?

720
00:31:54,300 --> 00:31:54,980
Shen Minghui.

721
00:31:56,220 --> 00:31:56,940
Mr. Sun.

722
00:31:58,420 --> 00:32:00,100
Why are you bouncing ball?

723
00:32:01,320 --> 00:32:02,220
We have PE next period.

724
00:32:02,220 --> 00:32:02,780
Stop!

725
00:32:04,140 --> 00:32:05,950
I'm warming up for PE.
What's wrong with that?

726
00:32:05,960 --> 00:32:06,740
You're not having PE anymore.

727
00:32:06,740 --> 00:32:07,940
The PE teacher is out sick.

728
00:32:08,100 --> 00:32:09,220
Next period is math.

729
00:32:16,620 --> 00:32:18,220
Listen, Shen Minghui,

730
00:32:18,660 --> 00:32:19,980
if you don't feel like studying,

731
00:32:19,980 --> 00:32:21,240
but don't drag other people down.

732
00:32:21,250 --> 00:32:22,420
If you don't want to be here,

733
00:32:22,430 --> 00:32:24,270
say the word,
I'll approve your leave anytime.

734
00:32:24,700 --> 00:32:25,340
I'll study.

735
00:32:25,740 --> 00:32:26,660
Go back inside then!

736
00:32:34,740 --> 00:32:35,420
Lu Bing,

737
00:32:35,940 --> 00:32:37,740
remember your promise.

738
00:32:40,980 --> 00:32:41,700
Go in.

739
00:32:51,220 --> 00:32:53,540
What? You want to complain

740
00:32:53,540 --> 00:32:54,780
(Principal's Office)
Mr. Sun for taking PE's time?

741
00:32:55,500 --> 00:32:56,740
(Strive on, stay humble.)
In short,

742
00:32:56,740 --> 00:32:57,950
it all comes down to one thing,

743
00:32:58,380 --> 00:32:59,180
teachers,

744
00:32:59,780 --> 00:33:01,700
the college entrance
exam is getting closer.

745
00:33:02,260 --> 00:33:04,660
I hope everyone gives it their all

746
00:33:05,220 --> 00:33:06,860
to get every student

747
00:33:07,020 --> 00:33:08,380
into their best possible shape.

748
00:33:10,260 --> 00:33:11,500
(Dad)

749
00:33:12,660 --> 00:33:13,420
Mr. Hu Gang,

750
00:33:14,430 --> 00:33:17,050
as a representative of the younger
faculty, please say a few words.

751
00:33:22,460 --> 00:33:24,940
I can't speak for anyone else,

752
00:33:25,260 --> 00:33:27,780
I can only speak for myself.

753
00:33:28,620 --> 00:33:30,220
Our current senior year students

754
00:33:30,220 --> 00:33:31,980
have very uneven grades,

755
00:33:32,500 --> 00:33:34,900
but I think physics
is actually a subject

756
00:33:35,180 --> 00:33:36,900
that can bring their scores up now.

757
00:33:37,220 --> 00:33:39,820
So I'm willing to shoulder more,

758
00:33:39,830 --> 00:33:40,920
give myself extra pressure.

759
00:33:40,980 --> 00:33:42,500
Whatever others don't want to do,

760
00:33:42,980 --> 00:33:43,740
I'll take it on.

761
00:33:44,340 --> 00:33:44,940
Okay.

762
00:33:45,700 --> 00:33:47,660
Since Mr. Hu Gang

763
00:33:47,940 --> 00:33:48,780
has volunteered,

764
00:33:48,780 --> 00:33:50,340
he will step up to the task.

765
00:33:51,420 --> 00:33:52,300
Here's the thing,

766
00:33:53,260 --> 00:33:53,980
due to

767
00:33:53,980 --> 00:33:55,380
certain circumstances,

768
00:33:55,740 --> 00:33:56,960
Mr. Sun can no longer

769
00:33:56,960 --> 00:33:58,890
continue as homeroom teacher
of Class 2 Senior 3.

770
00:33:58,980 --> 00:34:01,260
Please take over then, Mr. Hu.

771
00:34:02,900 --> 00:34:03,500
Me?

772
00:34:04,900 --> 00:34:05,500
You got this.

773
00:34:10,500 --> 00:34:11,380
Okay, Mr. Pan.

774
00:34:12,980 --> 00:34:13,740
Class,

775
00:34:14,760 --> 00:34:16,840
the college entrance exam
is just around the corner.

776
00:34:17,560 --> 00:34:18,500
As

777
00:34:19,460 --> 00:34:22,740
the final homeroom
teacher for Class 2 Senior 3,

778
00:34:23,340 --> 00:34:24,740
I'm under a lot of pressure.

779
00:34:24,740 --> 00:34:25,860
(Test Point 1:
Static Equilibrium Problems)

780
00:34:25,860 --> 00:34:26,460
But

781
00:34:26,900 --> 00:34:28,900
from a physics perspective,

782
00:34:28,980 --> 00:34:32,820
pressure is what generates power.

783
00:34:33,460 --> 00:34:34,900
Think about a steam engine,

784
00:34:35,100 --> 00:34:37,380
only when enough pressure builds up

785
00:34:37,460 --> 00:34:39,700
does it produce kinetic energy.

786
00:34:40,140 --> 00:34:42,460
So starting today,

787
00:34:43,420 --> 00:34:46,940
I want us to push forward together

788
00:34:47,420 --> 00:34:48,780
and fight for every one of you

789
00:34:48,980 --> 00:34:51,180
to get into the university
you're aiming for.

790
00:34:57,420 --> 00:34:58,690
Next,

791
00:34:59,310 --> 00:35:01,980
for the ten students who ranked
at the bottom in last month's exam,

792
00:35:02,660 --> 00:35:05,980
I'll be meeting your parents one by one.

793
00:35:06,500 --> 00:35:07,300
But don't panic,

794
00:35:07,980 --> 00:35:09,100
it's not to complain.

795
00:35:09,700 --> 00:35:11,940
I'm hoping that we, the teachers,

796
00:35:12,660 --> 00:35:14,100
students, and parents,

797
00:35:14,500 --> 00:35:15,860
can join forces,

798
00:35:15,860 --> 00:35:16,980
unite our efforts,

799
00:35:17,700 --> 00:35:20,500
and make one final push together.

800
00:35:21,380 --> 00:35:21,980
Mr. Hu.

801
00:35:23,780 --> 00:35:24,460
Yes?

802
00:35:25,660 --> 00:35:26,940
Do I need to call my parents too?

803
00:35:28,940 --> 00:35:29,650
What do you think?

804
00:35:32,740 --> 00:35:33,460
Mr. Shen,

805
00:35:34,060 --> 00:35:35,180
please take a look.

806
00:35:35,540 --> 00:35:37,660
This is Shen Minghui's physics exam.

807
00:35:38,260 --> 00:35:40,020
Let's look beyond the surface.

808
00:35:40,020 --> 00:35:42,060
Actually, his paper

809
00:35:42,060 --> 00:35:43,460
shows

810
00:35:43,820 --> 00:35:44,980
that Minghui

811
00:35:45,300 --> 00:35:46,780
is genuinely clever,

812
00:35:47,060 --> 00:35:48,540
but he just won't put in the effort.

813
00:35:48,820 --> 00:35:50,340
He isn't putting in any effort.

814
00:35:50,650 --> 00:35:51,780
So he needs a good spanking.

815
00:35:52,260 --> 00:35:52,980
No, no.

816
00:35:53,540 --> 00:35:54,780
That's not what I meant.

817
00:35:55,220 --> 00:35:56,500
My point is,

818
00:35:56,500 --> 00:35:58,540
if Minghui starts
putting in the effort now,

819
00:35:58,580 --> 00:36:00,140
he still has a lot of potential energy.

820
00:36:00,460 --> 00:36:02,540
If he just focuses his mind on studying,

821
00:36:02,740 --> 00:36:04,460
look, in math...

822
00:36:05,820 --> 00:36:06,340
Hey, dad.

823
00:36:06,860 --> 00:36:07,380
Hi, Ni.

824
00:36:08,040 --> 00:36:09,020
I heard you're going to the school

825
00:36:09,020 --> 00:36:10,380
to play stand-in dad for Minghui?

826
00:36:11,140 --> 00:36:12,160
Just filling in for today.

827
00:36:12,380 --> 00:36:14,620
Get his homeroom teacher's
contact for me.

828
00:36:14,620 --> 00:36:15,260
Why?

829
00:36:17,660 --> 00:36:18,940
Be nice to him.

830
00:36:18,940 --> 00:36:20,800
Who knows, he might
be your future son-in-law.

831
00:36:22,940 --> 00:36:23,940
Got it!

832
00:36:24,470 --> 00:36:25,900
The scores can improve very quickly.

833
00:36:28,620 --> 00:36:30,740
So, Mr. Shen,

834
00:36:30,940 --> 00:36:32,060
do you have any questions?

835
00:36:35,860 --> 00:36:36,740
Mr. Hu,

836
00:36:37,100 --> 00:36:39,060
how many years have
you been teaching here?

837
00:36:40,380 --> 00:36:41,980
Three years.

838
00:36:42,000 --> 00:36:44,140
I'm actually a graduate
of Nanzhou High School myself.

839
00:36:44,780 --> 00:36:45,460
Really?

840
00:36:46,620 --> 00:36:48,140
So young and promising.

841
00:36:48,420 --> 00:36:49,020
Oh, not at all.

842
00:36:49,020 --> 00:36:49,850
What a nice young man.

843
00:36:52,500 --> 00:36:53,140
Mr. Hu,

844
00:36:53,500 --> 00:36:55,380
let me add you on WeChat.

845
00:36:56,260 --> 00:36:56,620
Sure.

846
00:36:56,620 --> 00:36:57,900
It'll be easier to communicate.

847
00:36:57,900 --> 00:36:59,300
Yes, of course.

848
00:36:59,460 --> 00:37:00,340
Let me scan your code.

849
00:37:01,020 --> 00:37:01,780
Sure, sure.

850
00:37:02,340 --> 00:37:02,820
Here.

851
00:37:02,820 --> 00:37:04,380
(Hu Gang)

852
00:37:04,980 --> 00:37:05,540
There we go.

853
00:37:09,300 --> 00:37:10,140
Mr. Hu,

854
00:37:11,140 --> 00:37:12,540
do you have a girlfriend?

855
00:37:13,260 --> 00:37:14,980
No.

856
00:37:16,420 --> 00:37:17,420
Anyway,

857
00:37:17,900 --> 00:37:19,140
Mr. Shen, please look

858
00:37:19,540 --> 00:37:20,900
at Minghui's homework here.

859
00:37:20,900 --> 00:37:22,500
Actually, if we look at his work,

860
00:37:22,660 --> 00:37:25,100
we can also spot some of his strengths.

861
00:37:25,340 --> 00:37:27,140
He actually understands the concepts,

862
00:37:27,460 --> 00:37:29,020
he's just often careless.

863
00:37:29,380 --> 00:37:31,340
This boy is so unruly.

864
00:37:31,340 --> 00:37:33,740
His sister's grades back
then were way better than his.

865
00:37:33,980 --> 00:37:34,620
Really?

866
00:37:35,140 --> 00:37:35,620
Yes.

867
00:37:35,940 --> 00:37:36,740
Mr. Hu,

868
00:37:37,180 --> 00:37:38,060
how about

869
00:37:38,060 --> 00:37:39,780
I set you up on a date?

870
00:37:40,860 --> 00:37:41,460
His sister?

871
00:37:41,620 --> 00:37:43,220
You know, actually, I have a class.

872
00:37:43,220 --> 00:37:44,100
Mr. Hu! Mr. Hu.

873
00:37:44,100 --> 00:37:45,420
Please sit down.

874
00:37:45,420 --> 00:37:46,740
It's not his sister.

875
00:37:46,740 --> 00:37:48,340
It's one of his sister's best friends.

876
00:37:48,860 --> 00:37:49,650
His sister's friend?

877
00:37:49,860 --> 00:37:50,860
My daughter, actually.

878
00:37:51,980 --> 00:37:52,980
Your daughter?

879
00:37:55,780 --> 00:37:57,620
Actually, I'm not Minghui's father.

880
00:37:59,780 --> 00:38:00,740
That little rascal!

881
00:38:02,500 --> 00:38:03,140
See what I mean?

882
00:38:03,380 --> 00:38:04,780
You have to discipline the kids!

883
00:38:06,280 --> 00:38:07,950
How dare he get
himself a stand-in father!

884
00:38:09,580 --> 00:38:10,500
The nerve!

885
00:38:10,510 --> 00:38:11,620
Just wait until Shen Minghui gets home.

886
00:38:11,620 --> 00:38:12,860
He's going to get it from me.

887
00:38:13,460 --> 00:38:17,420
(Xin City Grand Court)

888
00:38:17,860 --> 00:38:18,420
Mingzhu,

889
00:38:19,360 --> 00:38:21,380
Dad's definitely going to
break my legs this time.

890
00:38:21,760 --> 00:38:23,300
I thought you were a business prodigy?

891
00:38:23,310 --> 00:38:24,950
Weren't you going to
get into Peking University?

892
00:38:24,960 --> 00:38:26,950
How are you going to get
to Beijing with broken legs?

893
00:38:27,260 --> 00:38:29,740
That's because their thinking
isn't progressive enough!

894
00:38:30,140 --> 00:38:31,380
They lack vision!

895
00:38:31,780 --> 00:38:32,860
You know what they say,

896
00:38:32,960 --> 00:38:35,780
"Those who achieve great things
don't get bogged down in minor details."

897
00:38:36,020 --> 00:38:37,300
You think I asked Ni Debao

898
00:38:37,300 --> 00:38:38,620
to see my teacher for myself?

899
00:38:39,820 --> 00:38:41,420
No, it was for Dad's sake!

900
00:38:42,100 --> 00:38:42,940
Think about it,

901
00:38:42,940 --> 00:38:44,380
he's so busy every day.

902
00:38:44,900 --> 00:38:46,100
I was just...

903
00:38:46,860 --> 00:38:47,540
What?

904
00:38:47,620 --> 00:38:49,140
Lightening Dad's load?

905
00:38:49,420 --> 00:38:50,420
Exactly!

906
00:38:51,620 --> 00:38:52,140
See, Mingzhu,

907
00:38:52,860 --> 00:38:55,300
your thinking is progressive.

908
00:38:55,580 --> 00:38:56,860
You have vision.

909
00:38:57,700 --> 00:39:00,620
So could you maybe put in a good word

910
00:39:01,100 --> 00:39:02,060
with Dad for me?

911
00:39:02,340 --> 00:39:03,980
I knew you'd pull this.

912
00:39:12,060 --> 00:39:12,620
Dad,

913
00:39:13,020 --> 00:39:14,940
Minghui is with me right now.

914
00:39:15,420 --> 00:39:18,060
He's just afraid you're going
to hit him when he gets home.

915
00:39:26,500 --> 00:39:27,100
Oh, no.

916
00:39:28,100 --> 00:39:28,940
Shen Minghui,

917
00:39:29,980 --> 00:39:32,060
that's the family heirloom
of Jianqi's family!

918
00:39:34,860 --> 00:39:37,860
Mingzhu, lately I've had a lot of
couples on my public account

919
00:39:37,860 --> 00:39:40,340
asking about the Nanxi Hotel
for their wedding banquets.

920
00:39:40,780 --> 00:39:42,220
I wanted to discuss setting up

921
00:39:42,540 --> 00:39:44,860
some kind of fan discount with you.

922
00:39:46,460 --> 00:39:47,500
I'll talk to my manager

923
00:39:47,500 --> 00:39:48,940
about it tomorrow at work.

924
00:39:50,540 --> 00:39:52,020
What's wrong? You sound so drained.

925
00:39:52,020 --> 00:39:52,940
Are you feeling okay?

926
00:39:53,660 --> 00:39:54,500
My brother

927
00:39:55,100 --> 00:39:57,060
broke the jade bracelet
my mother-in-law gave me.

928
00:39:59,220 --> 00:40:00,620
Mingzhu, wait,

929
00:40:00,620 --> 00:40:01,660
I'm actually near your place.

930
00:40:01,660 --> 00:40:02,860
I'm coming over now.

931
00:40:16,740 --> 00:40:17,780
What do we do?

932
00:40:18,500 --> 00:40:19,940
It's completely shattered.

933
00:40:22,220 --> 00:40:23,260
There's only one solution,

934
00:40:23,260 --> 00:40:24,760
drag the culprit out and
give him a good beating.

935
00:40:25,860 --> 00:40:26,420
Mingzhu,

936
00:40:27,220 --> 00:40:28,020
I'm sorry.

937
00:40:28,320 --> 00:40:30,320
I'll go next door right now
and face Jianqi's mom.

938
00:40:30,340 --> 00:40:32,530
I'll offer a sincere apology and
take whatever punishment comes.

939
00:40:32,540 --> 00:40:33,380
Get back here.

940
00:40:34,480 --> 00:40:36,550
If anyone's going to beat you,
it'll be your own mother.

941
00:40:42,420 --> 00:40:43,580
My mom knows

942
00:40:43,940 --> 00:40:45,900
a master craftsman who works with jade.

943
00:40:45,900 --> 00:40:46,780
He can do repairs.

944
00:40:46,780 --> 00:40:48,940
I'll take it and have my mom ask him.

945
00:40:49,140 --> 00:40:50,020
Hang on, Zhixia,

946
00:40:50,260 --> 00:40:52,380
just have your mom
send me his contact info.

947
00:40:52,500 --> 00:40:53,500
Don't bother.

948
00:40:53,500 --> 00:40:54,260
He doesn't know you.

949
00:40:54,260 --> 00:40:55,300
He'll only help my Mom.

950
00:40:55,300 --> 00:40:56,420
If he can fix it,

951
00:40:56,620 --> 00:40:57,980
your mom is my new mother!

952
00:41:01,420 --> 00:41:02,500
I thought I was your aunt?

953
00:41:02,620 --> 00:41:03,220
Sister.

954
00:41:03,380 --> 00:41:04,420
You're my sister!

955
00:41:06,940 --> 00:41:07,660
(Family harmony)

956
00:41:07,660 --> 00:41:09,740
You little rascal,
I'm going to kill you!

957
00:41:10,100 --> 00:41:11,460
Mom, you're doing this for real?

958
00:41:12,980 --> 00:41:14,980
You're truly one of a kind,
Shen Minghui!

959
00:41:15,720 --> 00:41:17,620
First, you get someone
to impersonate your dad,

960
00:41:18,020 --> 00:41:20,060
and then you go and smash
your sister's bracelet!

961
00:41:20,060 --> 00:41:21,140
I'll pay for it, Mom.

962
00:41:21,860 --> 00:41:23,340
Pay for it, my foot!

963
00:41:23,620 --> 00:41:25,180
That's a family heirloom!

964
00:41:25,190 --> 00:41:27,520
It's worth tens of thousands.
How are you going to pay that back?

965
00:41:28,940 --> 00:41:29,740
Shen Minghui!

966
00:41:30,340 --> 00:41:31,260
You stop right there!

967
00:41:31,260 --> 00:41:32,220
(Ni's Clinic)

968
00:41:32,220 --> 00:41:34,860
You can run, but you can't hide!

969
00:41:37,820 --> 00:41:39,820
Some people really have no shame.

970
00:41:40,760 --> 00:41:41,660
Since we're neighbors,

971
00:41:41,660 --> 00:41:43,500
I'm not going to name names.

972
00:41:44,100 --> 00:41:46,500
It's one thing if you've
been causing troubles.

973
00:41:47,160 --> 00:41:49,360
But you had the nerve to go
pretend to be my son's dad?

974
00:41:49,480 --> 00:41:50,580
Let me tell you something!

975
00:41:50,580 --> 00:41:53,180
The next person who
pretends to be my son's father,

976
00:41:53,580 --> 00:41:54,220
I'll do to them

977
00:41:54,220 --> 00:41:56,140
what I did to the Ni family's cat.

978
00:41:56,140 --> 00:41:57,300
I'll have them neutered!

979
00:41:58,820 --> 00:41:59,620
Do you hear me?

980
00:41:59,700 --> 00:42:01,540
Is Xiu'e yelling at you?

981
00:42:01,740 --> 00:42:03,220
Of course not.

982
00:42:03,300 --> 00:42:04,580
I have two daughters of my own

983
00:42:04,580 --> 00:42:05,660
to worry about!

984
00:42:05,660 --> 00:42:06,860
Where would I find the time
to go be someone else's dad?

985
00:42:06,860 --> 00:42:08,180
Stop right there, you little brat!

986
00:42:08,700 --> 00:42:09,340
Really?

987
00:42:09,980 --> 00:42:11,220
Of course.

988
00:42:14,760 --> 00:42:15,850
(Please verify fingerprint.)

989
00:42:16,180 --> 00:42:17,140
(Unlock failed.)

990
00:42:17,780 --> 00:42:19,740
Why is it locked from the inside?

991
00:42:21,580 --> 00:42:22,420
Mingzhu?

992
00:42:24,780 --> 00:42:25,380
Mom,

993
00:42:25,900 --> 00:42:27,060
I'm already in bed.

994
00:42:27,380 --> 00:42:28,900
Is it something urgent?

995
00:42:29,340 --> 00:42:29,940
Listen,

996
00:42:29,940 --> 00:42:32,060
Dad gets back from
his work trip tomorrow.

997
00:42:32,060 --> 00:42:33,850
We're having a family
dinner in the evening.

998
00:42:34,220 --> 00:42:35,740
Come home early tomorrow.

999
00:42:36,540 --> 00:42:37,140
Got it.

1000
00:42:37,900 --> 00:42:39,220
Good night!

1001
00:42:39,900 --> 00:42:41,380
