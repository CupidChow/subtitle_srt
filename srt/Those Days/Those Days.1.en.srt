(Adapted from iceread.com novel
"You Xi" by Qingyang Wanxi)

=Episode 1=

4
00:01:26,030 --> 00:01:27,410
(Ni's Clinic)
It'll hurt a little.

5
00:01:28,950 --> 00:01:29,750
Next, please.

6
00:01:30,030 --> 00:01:31,030
My turn.

7
00:01:31,030 --> 00:01:32,390
One at a time.

8
00:01:32,390 --> 00:01:33,800
Don't rush.

9
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:36,590
If you rush me, I'll smack you.

10
00:01:40,590 --> 00:01:41,230
You're not sick.

11
00:01:41,230 --> 00:01:42,100
Mingzhu, you're back.

12
00:01:42,110 --> 00:01:42,750
Yeah.

13
00:01:44,440 --> 00:01:45,560
Get your dirty hand off.

14
00:01:45,560 --> 00:01:48,280
If you grab again, I'll tell your dad
to break your fingers.

15
00:01:49,340 --> 00:01:50,820
Why are the girls in your neighborhood

16
00:01:50,820 --> 00:01:51,700
so fierce?

17
00:01:51,700 --> 00:01:52,540
Not all.

18
00:01:52,540 --> 00:01:53,500
I'm not.

19
00:01:54,900 --> 00:01:55,660
Xiaoni,

20
00:01:56,060 --> 00:01:57,660
can you take my pulse?

21
00:02:01,300 --> 00:02:02,260
It's pregnancy pulse.

22
00:02:04,580 --> 00:02:05,540
She's amazing.

23
00:02:06,060 --> 00:02:07,820
Her dad and grandpa are
Chinese physicians.

24
00:02:07,820 --> 00:02:08,840
It's a family tradition.

25
00:02:09,820 --> 00:02:10,820
Dr. Xiaoni,

26
00:02:11,100 --> 00:02:12,340
you're incredible.

27
00:02:13,020 --> 00:02:14,020
Is the baby yours?

28
00:02:16,500 --> 00:02:17,980
Yes, mine.

29
00:02:17,980 --> 00:02:19,020
Mingzhu, you're here.

30
00:02:19,260 --> 00:02:20,060
Mr. Ni.

31
00:02:20,860 --> 00:02:22,340
There's a funeral in Yujia Village.

32
00:02:22,340 --> 00:02:23,840
They want me to help
with the arrangements.

33
00:02:24,220 --> 00:02:26,420
Dad, who died?

34
00:02:27,220 --> 00:02:27,860
Xiaoni,

35
00:02:27,860 --> 00:02:29,340
how many times have I told you?

36
00:02:29,340 --> 00:02:30,220
Don't say "died".

37
00:02:30,220 --> 00:02:31,860
Just say they "went to enjoy blessings".

38
00:02:32,020 --> 00:02:32,780
Mr. Ni,

39
00:02:32,780 --> 00:02:35,580
your family provides the full package

40
00:02:35,580 --> 00:02:37,500
from treating illnesses
to sending people off.

41
00:02:37,500 --> 00:02:39,260
Xiaoni has inherited your skills.

42
00:02:39,260 --> 00:02:40,460
She's a genius.

43
00:02:40,740 --> 00:02:41,460
I'm flattered.

44
00:02:41,460 --> 00:02:42,340
But she's gifted.

45
00:02:42,820 --> 00:02:43,580
Have you eaten?

46
00:02:43,900 --> 00:02:44,940
Come eat at my place.

47
00:02:44,940 --> 00:02:45,660
No thanks.

48
00:02:45,660 --> 00:02:47,510
We're heading back to my house
to have dinner.

49
00:02:47,820 --> 00:02:49,420
Shen's a good cook.

50
00:02:49,420 --> 00:02:50,660
You're a lucky guy.

51
00:02:50,660 --> 00:02:51,500
Yeah.

52
00:02:52,220 --> 00:02:52,940
Xiaoni,

53
00:02:53,260 --> 00:02:54,900
I'm going. Bye-bye.

54
00:02:55,140 --> 00:02:58,100
You can't get pregnant before marriage.

55
00:03:03,700 --> 00:03:04,940
(Marriage Certificate)
Look at this.

56
00:03:06,900 --> 00:03:08,500
Marriage certificates

57
00:03:08,500 --> 00:03:10,220
are so pretty now.

58
00:03:11,220 --> 00:03:12,340
What are you talking about?

59
00:03:12,380 --> 00:03:14,180
It's not about the certificate.

60
00:03:14,190 --> 00:03:16,080
It's our son-in-law and daughter
who are pretty.

61
00:03:16,400 --> 00:03:17,300
- Exactly.
- Sometimes

62
00:03:17,300 --> 00:03:18,740
your mom

63
00:03:18,940 --> 00:03:20,420
doesn't get to the point.

64
00:03:21,700 --> 00:03:22,540
Jianqi.

65
00:03:24,960 --> 00:03:26,750
It hasn't been easy for you two
to get here.

66
00:03:27,220 --> 00:03:29,620
We've watched it all these years.

67
00:03:29,620 --> 00:03:31,180
Now that you've gotten your certificate,

68
00:03:31,180 --> 00:03:32,660
you're family.

69
00:03:33,620 --> 00:03:34,540
You have to

70
00:03:35,060 --> 00:03:36,140
talk things out,

71
00:03:37,440 --> 00:03:38,540
and look out for each other.

72
00:03:38,860 --> 00:03:39,980
Don't fight.

73
00:03:40,340 --> 00:03:41,140
All couples

74
00:03:41,460 --> 00:03:43,900
have their arguments.

75
00:03:43,900 --> 00:03:44,620
Right?

76
00:03:44,820 --> 00:03:46,060
That's fine.

77
00:03:46,460 --> 00:03:47,760
Just don't drag it on overnight.

78
00:03:48,020 --> 00:03:50,300
Yes. Husbands and wives
shouldn't go to bed angry.

79
00:03:50,300 --> 00:03:51,180
Mr. Shen, Mrs. Shen,

80
00:03:51,420 --> 00:03:52,620
we won't fight.

81
00:03:53,180 --> 00:03:55,700
Even if we do, I'll be the first

82
00:03:56,060 --> 00:03:56,980
to apologize.

83
00:03:57,820 --> 00:03:58,620
Wait.

84
00:03:59,220 --> 00:04:01,260
Why are you still calling us
Mr. Shen and Mrs. Shen?

85
00:04:05,060 --> 00:04:05,700
Dad.

86
00:04:07,260 --> 00:04:07,900
Mom.

87
00:04:16,980 --> 00:04:17,660
Jianqi,

88
00:04:18,460 --> 00:04:19,700
there's something

89
00:04:21,100 --> 00:04:23,260
we've wanted to tell you
for a long time.

90
00:04:23,260 --> 00:04:24,860
We didn't know how.

91
00:04:25,740 --> 00:04:28,340
Actually, Mingzhu

92
00:04:31,260 --> 00:04:32,580
isn't our biological daughter.

93
00:04:34,700 --> 00:04:37,460
But from the day we brought her home,

94
00:04:42,860 --> 00:04:44,340
we treated her

95
00:04:44,340 --> 00:04:45,500
like our own.

96
00:04:46,340 --> 00:04:47,460
More than our own.

97
00:04:47,460 --> 00:04:49,340
So we named her

98
00:04:49,340 --> 00:04:50,340
Shen Mingzhu.

99
00:04:52,140 --> 00:04:54,980
I hope you'll treat her well.

100
00:04:56,420 --> 00:04:57,660
What's wrong with you?

101
00:04:58,220 --> 00:04:59,900
I'm talking to them.

102
00:05:00,220 --> 00:05:00,940
No.

103
00:05:01,340 --> 00:05:03,300
It's a happy day.
Why are you saying this?

104
00:05:03,300 --> 00:05:04,140
Come on.

105
00:05:04,140 --> 00:05:05,620
Say what you need to say.

106
00:05:05,820 --> 00:05:06,580
I'm done.

107
00:05:06,820 --> 00:05:08,500
You didn't get to the point.

108
00:05:08,820 --> 00:05:10,500
Back then, when we went to a village

109
00:05:10,500 --> 00:05:11,620
to collect vegetables,

110
00:05:11,940 --> 00:05:13,700
there was a family
that had just had twins.

111
00:05:13,700 --> 00:05:15,540
They were struggling,
so they kept the son

112
00:05:15,540 --> 00:05:16,940
and didn't want the daughter.

113
00:05:17,140 --> 00:05:18,700
So we took her home.

114
00:05:20,260 --> 00:05:21,420
Anyway, it's been so many years.

115
00:05:21,420 --> 00:05:23,260
There were no cell phones or WeChat

116
00:05:23,260 --> 00:05:24,300
at that time.

117
00:05:24,740 --> 00:05:26,180
So we lost contact.

118
00:05:26,420 --> 00:05:27,740
Dad, Mom,

119
00:05:28,780 --> 00:05:29,700
don't worry.

120
00:05:30,160 --> 00:05:31,940
Whether Mingzhu is
your biological daughter

121
00:05:31,940 --> 00:05:32,860
or not,

122
00:05:33,260 --> 00:05:34,420
I'm fine with it.

123
00:05:35,460 --> 00:05:38,060
I love Mingzhu.

124
00:05:51,260 --> 00:05:51,940
Minghui.

125
00:05:52,320 --> 00:05:53,060
What a coincidence.

126
00:05:53,060 --> 00:05:54,460
I just came from your place.

127
00:05:54,820 --> 00:05:55,620
Let me tell you.

128
00:05:55,620 --> 00:05:57,380
I'm officially
your brother-in-law today.

129
00:05:57,380 --> 00:05:58,640
Come on. Call me brother-in-law.

130
00:05:58,980 --> 00:05:59,860
Brother-in-law.

131
00:06:01,580 --> 00:06:02,260
Brother-in-law,

132
00:06:02,500 --> 00:06:03,820
can you lend me your car?

133
00:06:04,900 --> 00:06:05,580
Sure.

134
00:06:05,580 --> 00:06:06,980
Next time.

135
00:06:11,860 --> 00:06:14,240
Let me take a look.

136
00:06:16,340 --> 00:06:17,900
Let me take a look and share your luck.

137
00:06:17,900 --> 00:06:20,140
This is what they call
a perfect match.

138
00:06:20,620 --> 00:06:21,540
So pretty. So handsome.

139
00:06:21,540 --> 00:06:23,580
- Perfect match.
- Mingzhu.

140
00:06:23,580 --> 00:06:25,020
- Perfect match.
- He's handsome.

141
00:06:25,020 --> 00:06:25,860
Of course.

142
00:06:26,300 --> 00:06:27,060
Mingzhu

143
00:06:27,660 --> 00:06:28,820
is our cherished pearl.

144
00:06:28,820 --> 00:06:31,100
We'll throw a big banquet.

145
00:06:31,100 --> 00:06:32,860
You all have to come
and share the joy.

146
00:06:32,860 --> 00:06:33,780
Of course.

147
00:06:33,780 --> 00:06:34,700
We'll be there.

148
00:06:34,700 --> 00:06:37,500
Mingzhu, where are you holding
the wedding banquet?

149
00:06:37,510 --> 00:06:39,820
We haven't decided yet.
We'll let you all know once it's set.

150
00:06:39,820 --> 00:06:41,100
You must tell us.

151
00:06:41,100 --> 00:06:41,660
We will.

152
00:06:42,110 --> 00:06:43,580
My son-in-law's family has standards.

153
00:06:43,580 --> 00:06:45,980
They know how to do things properly.
We follow their lead.

154
00:06:46,220 --> 00:06:47,140
Of course.

155
00:06:47,140 --> 00:06:48,700
Do you know where their new home is?

156
00:06:48,710 --> 00:06:49,540
- Don't know.
- Where?

157
00:06:49,540 --> 00:06:51,580
Xin City Grand Court, you know it?

158
00:06:51,580 --> 00:06:52,100
Really?

159
00:06:52,100 --> 00:06:53,500
- That's a luxury complex.
- A luxury complex.

160
00:06:53,500 --> 00:06:54,780
It's very expensive.

161
00:06:54,780 --> 00:06:55,780
- Yeah.
- Very expensive.

162
00:06:55,780 --> 00:06:56,900
Super expensive.

163
00:06:57,140 --> 00:06:58,340
Mom. Hey.

164
00:06:58,580 --> 00:06:59,300
What?

165
00:06:59,740 --> 00:07:00,580
Tone it down.

166
00:07:00,580 --> 00:07:01,460
Mom, I'm back.

167
00:07:01,460 --> 00:07:02,500
I'm not bragging.

168
00:07:02,500 --> 00:07:03,620
I'm telling the truth, right?

169
00:07:03,620 --> 00:07:04,020
Right.

170
00:07:04,020 --> 00:07:05,860
They're neighbors

171
00:07:05,860 --> 00:07:06,820
who watched you grow up.

172
00:07:06,820 --> 00:07:08,140
Their new home is

173
00:07:08,140 --> 00:07:10,980
(Shen Mingzhu)
right across from Fengqi's parents' place.

174
00:07:10,980 --> 00:07:12,260
- Really?
- That's convenient.

175
00:07:12,260 --> 00:07:12,740
Right.

176
00:07:12,740 --> 00:07:14,420
My daughter is so blessed.

177
00:07:14,620 --> 00:07:15,620
Unlike my son.

178
00:07:15,620 --> 00:07:16,300
What are we supposed to do with him?

179
00:07:16,300 --> 00:07:17,460
They're so much different.

180
00:07:18,020 --> 00:07:18,700
Mom.

181
00:07:19,540 --> 00:07:20,740
Now that Mingzhu's married,

182
00:07:21,100 --> 00:07:22,780
can I move out of the attic?

183
00:07:23,100 --> 00:07:24,120
We'll talk about it later.

184
00:07:24,420 --> 00:07:26,500
Dad promised me when he renovated.

185
00:07:26,500 --> 00:07:27,260
Alright, alright.

186
00:07:27,260 --> 00:07:27,860
Let me tell you.

187
00:07:27,860 --> 00:07:30,580
My in-laws' daughter is overseas.

188
00:07:31,380 --> 00:07:34,460
Guess how big a house
my two in-laws live in?

189
00:07:34,860 --> 00:07:36,140
How would we know?

190
00:07:36,140 --> 00:07:37,140
We can't guess.

191
00:07:37,140 --> 00:07:37,700
Just say it.

192
00:07:37,700 --> 00:07:38,900
Two hundred square meters.

193
00:07:38,900 --> 00:07:39,900
For just the two of them.

194
00:07:40,580 --> 00:07:41,180
That big?

195
00:07:41,180 --> 00:07:41,640
That big.

196
00:07:41,640 --> 00:07:43,220
Wouldn't they get lost inside the house?

197
00:07:43,220 --> 00:07:44,060
If it were me,

198
00:07:44,060 --> 00:07:45,860
I'd be scared to go to
the bathroom at night.

199
00:07:46,180 --> 00:07:47,820
- Exactly.
- Dad, the chives are cleaned.

200
00:07:47,820 --> 00:07:48,980
Coming. Good.

201
00:07:49,460 --> 00:07:50,100
Zhu,

202
00:07:50,780 --> 00:07:51,940
come home when you can.

203
00:07:51,940 --> 00:07:53,180
I'll always have your room ready.

204
00:07:53,180 --> 00:07:53,820
Hear that?

205
00:07:53,820 --> 00:07:54,340
Mom.

206
00:07:54,340 --> 00:07:55,620
That's my room.

207
00:07:56,220 --> 00:07:56,820
Mom,

208
00:07:57,300 --> 00:07:57,980
I'll come home

209
00:07:57,980 --> 00:07:59,460
every day.

210
00:08:00,460 --> 00:08:01,100
Good.

211
00:08:01,100 --> 00:08:01,660
Come on.

212
00:08:01,660 --> 00:08:02,940
Go upstairs and do your homework.

213
00:08:02,940 --> 00:08:04,220
You've been in high school
for five years.

214
00:08:04,220 --> 00:08:05,620
How much longer
are you planning to stay there?

215
00:08:05,620 --> 00:08:06,820
Minghui

216
00:08:06,820 --> 00:08:09,180
wants to wear out
his Nanzhou High School uniform,

217
00:08:09,180 --> 00:08:10,980
right?

218
00:08:11,740 --> 00:08:12,340
Dad.

219
00:08:12,860 --> 00:08:15,060
If you say it like that,
I feel no pressure at all now.

220
00:08:15,060 --> 00:08:16,260
(How are things on your side?)
Mr. Shen always looks on the bright side.

221
00:08:16,260 --> 00:08:18,220
(Sunny and bright)
Yeah, he doesn't take things too hard.

222
00:08:22,460 --> 00:08:23,540
(Feng Jianqi)

223
00:08:24,300 --> 00:08:25,140
(Marriage Certificate)

224
00:08:26,220 --> 00:08:27,060
Just four words.

225
00:08:28,020 --> 00:08:29,100
I have no words.

226
00:08:29,340 --> 00:08:30,020
Mom,

227
00:08:30,540 --> 00:08:32,700
Mingzhu doesn't care about our money.

228
00:08:33,020 --> 00:08:34,550
She likes me because I'm a good person.

229
00:08:36,140 --> 00:08:38,360
If our family weren't well-off,

230
00:08:38,360 --> 00:08:40,260
would we have been able
to raise you this well?

231
00:08:45,740 --> 00:08:47,540
You dated her for three years.

232
00:08:48,060 --> 00:08:49,900
Your dad and I stayed silent.

233
00:08:50,220 --> 00:08:52,460
Anyone with a brain could tell

234
00:08:52,820 --> 00:08:54,540
that no approval means objection.

235
00:08:55,580 --> 00:08:57,300
Any other girl would've left long ago.

236
00:08:57,780 --> 00:09:00,220
Why did Shen Mingzhu hold on
for so long?

237
00:09:02,020 --> 00:09:03,540
Because she's determined

238
00:09:03,540 --> 00:09:05,660
to marry up.

239
00:09:06,020 --> 00:09:07,340
And now she's got what she wanted.

240
00:09:07,460 --> 00:09:08,340
Registered.

241
00:09:08,700 --> 00:09:09,700
Pregnant.

242
00:09:09,860 --> 00:09:10,980
The deal is sealed.

243
00:09:10,980 --> 00:09:11,660
Mom,

244
00:09:12,980 --> 00:09:14,740
I'm the one who got what I wanted.

245
00:09:15,060 --> 00:09:16,820
I chased Mingzhu for over three years.

246
00:09:17,180 --> 00:09:19,180
It was me who wouldn't let go.

247
00:09:19,740 --> 00:09:20,780
Feng Zhi,

248
00:09:20,780 --> 00:09:22,580
did you hear what he said?

249
00:09:23,340 --> 00:09:25,020
You've lost your mind.

250
00:09:25,300 --> 00:09:26,980
You wouldn't listen to your own parents,

251
00:09:26,980 --> 00:09:29,300
but let a poor girl drag you around.

252
00:09:30,020 --> 00:09:32,580
You have a graduate degree
from a prestigious university.

253
00:09:33,020 --> 00:09:34,580
Think with your head, please.

254
00:09:34,580 --> 00:09:35,900
You've fallen into

255
00:09:35,900 --> 00:09:38,140
her play-hard-to-get trap.

256
00:09:38,980 --> 00:09:40,340
Marriage is her stepping stone.

257
00:09:41,020 --> 00:09:41,700
Good for her.

258
00:09:42,100 --> 00:09:44,220
She went from rags to riches.

259
00:09:44,220 --> 00:09:44,900
Enough.

260
00:09:47,020 --> 00:09:47,900
They're married now.

261
00:09:49,140 --> 00:09:51,940
Whatever difference in status there was,
we're family now.

262
00:09:52,300 --> 00:09:53,580
Rags to riches?

263
00:09:53,820 --> 00:09:55,100
Don't say that again.

264
00:09:55,940 --> 00:09:57,060
We're forming a union,

265
00:09:57,780 --> 00:09:58,740
not a feud.

266
00:10:00,740 --> 00:10:02,260
Alright. That's the end of it.

267
00:10:03,300 --> 00:10:04,060
Jianqi,

268
00:10:04,060 --> 00:10:05,020
I'm curious.

269
00:10:05,620 --> 00:10:06,980
What do Mingzhu's parent think

270
00:10:07,980 --> 00:10:10,380
about the wedding?

271
00:10:10,820 --> 00:10:11,620
I mean,

272
00:10:12,180 --> 00:10:14,340
should both families

273
00:10:14,340 --> 00:10:15,100
discuss it?

274
00:10:15,100 --> 00:10:16,180
Right.

275
00:10:16,180 --> 00:10:16,860
You know,

276
00:10:16,860 --> 00:10:18,060
the wedding is important.

277
00:10:19,420 --> 00:10:20,860
Our guests

278
00:10:20,860 --> 00:10:22,740
are all respected people.

279
00:10:22,940 --> 00:10:24,100
The guests her family invites

280
00:10:24,100 --> 00:10:25,340
are probably regular folks.

281
00:10:25,820 --> 00:10:27,060
These two groups

282
00:10:27,060 --> 00:10:28,580
have no overlap at all.

283
00:10:29,500 --> 00:10:31,620
If we put them together
at the wedding banquet,

284
00:10:31,620 --> 00:10:32,860
wouldn't it be ridiculous?

285
00:10:33,860 --> 00:10:35,460
What if someone tries to ask for a favor

286
00:10:35,580 --> 00:10:37,020
or borrow money

287
00:10:37,340 --> 00:10:38,740
at the wedding?

288
00:10:38,740 --> 00:10:40,380
And what if they get drunk

289
00:10:40,380 --> 00:10:41,340
and start fighting?

290
00:10:41,340 --> 00:10:42,620
That's why

291
00:10:42,620 --> 00:10:44,140
we need to sit down

292
00:10:44,140 --> 00:10:45,860
and talk things through peacefully

293
00:10:45,860 --> 00:10:47,500
to solve things properly.

294
00:10:48,340 --> 00:10:48,980
Jianqi,

295
00:10:49,420 --> 00:10:50,500
how about this?

296
00:10:50,820 --> 00:10:51,660
Your mom and I will

297
00:10:51,660 --> 00:10:54,580
visit Mingzhu's parents

298
00:10:54,580 --> 00:10:55,820
this weekend.

299
00:10:55,820 --> 00:10:56,860
See if that works for them.

300
00:10:58,100 --> 00:10:59,820
Alright, I'll tell her.

301
00:11:00,380 --> 00:11:02,180
And there's another thing.

302
00:11:02,460 --> 00:11:03,780
It's troublesome.

303
00:11:05,580 --> 00:11:06,660
Shen Mingzhu

304
00:11:06,940 --> 00:11:08,380
was adopted.

305
00:11:09,300 --> 00:11:12,500
What if her biological parents
show up on the wedding day?

306
00:11:12,740 --> 00:11:14,940
Not only would you suddenly
get another pair of parents,

307
00:11:14,940 --> 00:11:17,060
but you might also be getting
a bunch of siblings.

308
00:11:17,060 --> 00:11:18,240
What are you going to do then?

309
00:11:18,820 --> 00:11:19,540
Heavens.

310
00:11:19,540 --> 00:11:21,500
She'd better not drag my son
into this mess.

311
00:11:21,500 --> 00:11:22,140
Mom,

312
00:11:22,620 --> 00:11:24,460
what if Mingzhu's a lost princess?

313
00:11:24,700 --> 00:11:26,020
Then I'd be a prince consort.

314
00:11:26,660 --> 00:11:27,260
Out.

315
00:11:31,900 --> 00:11:32,700
Ni,

316
00:11:33,620 --> 00:11:35,620
you really got some skills.

317
00:11:35,620 --> 00:11:36,740
- Of course.
- I look great.

318
00:11:39,980 --> 00:11:41,540
Can someone get me a sharpener?

319
00:11:41,540 --> 00:11:44,060
I'll go get it.

320
00:11:44,060 --> 00:11:44,780
Ni, I'll go.

321
00:11:44,790 --> 00:11:45,620
I'll get it for you, Ni.

322
00:11:45,620 --> 00:11:47,260
Look at my influence.

323
00:11:47,460 --> 00:11:48,940
My dad handles funerals,

324
00:11:48,940 --> 00:11:49,980
and I handle weddings.

325
00:11:49,980 --> 00:11:51,260
The Ni family does

326
00:11:51,260 --> 00:11:52,740
all kinds of ceremonies.

327
00:11:52,740 --> 00:11:54,660
Xiaoni knows how to take pulses.

328
00:11:54,940 --> 00:11:56,180
She can treat patients too.

329
00:11:56,180 --> 00:11:57,060
You know what?

330
00:11:57,060 --> 00:11:58,340
Nanzhou would be paralyzed

331
00:11:58,340 --> 00:11:59,500
without the Ni family.

332
00:11:59,500 --> 00:12:00,540
Totally paralyzed.

333
00:12:00,740 --> 00:12:01,740
Xiaoni's amazing.

334
00:12:01,940 --> 00:12:03,540
She figured out I was pregnant.

335
00:12:03,540 --> 00:12:04,180
I know, right?

336
00:12:04,340 --> 00:12:05,820
She learned that from me.

337
00:12:05,820 --> 00:12:07,290
I could take a pulse since I was a kid.

338
00:12:07,300 --> 00:12:08,980
I got it from my mom,

339
00:12:08,980 --> 00:12:10,420
and Xiaoni got it from her mom.

340
00:12:10,780 --> 00:12:12,420
My dad is really something.

341
00:12:12,560 --> 00:12:15,340
After searching all his life,
he ended up with the same type of wife.

342
00:12:15,340 --> 00:12:16,540
Both of them are fierce.

343
00:12:18,560 --> 00:12:20,500
Stop it. If your mom hears you,
she'll kill you.

344
00:12:20,500 --> 00:12:22,020
It's fine. She knows.

345
00:12:22,020 --> 00:12:23,180
Xiaoni's mom is very fierce.

346
00:12:23,180 --> 00:12:24,060
Just like my mom

347
00:12:24,060 --> 00:12:25,320
- when she was young.
- Really?

348
00:12:27,980 --> 00:12:29,620
(Family Harmony Brings Prosperity)
Look at her. She's laughing.

349
00:12:29,620 --> 00:12:31,100
She doesn't even have a boyfriend.

350
00:12:32,580 --> 00:12:34,940
These two girls grew up together.

351
00:12:34,940 --> 00:12:37,460
How did the gap get so big?

352
00:12:39,100 --> 00:12:39,820
Don't say that.

353
00:12:39,820 --> 00:12:41,300
Ni's great, right?

354
00:12:41,300 --> 00:12:43,100
Yes, she is.

355
00:12:43,620 --> 00:12:45,980
I've been working
in the marriage bureau all my life.

356
00:12:46,340 --> 00:12:49,220
Is there ever a guy like Feng Jianqi?

357
00:12:49,220 --> 00:12:51,900
Yes, but rare.

358
00:12:53,340 --> 00:12:56,620
Your daughter really found a treasure.

359
00:12:58,560 --> 00:13:00,260
Her life's going to be
sweeter than honey.

360
00:13:00,260 --> 00:13:02,100
Come on. Look at the bride.

361
00:13:02,380 --> 00:13:03,220
Isn't she pretty?

362
00:13:04,580 --> 00:13:05,700
Yes.

363
00:13:05,700 --> 00:13:06,580
Mingzhu,

364
00:13:06,900 --> 00:13:08,820
you look exactly like a bride.

365
00:13:08,820 --> 00:13:10,260
Ni did my makeup.

366
00:13:11,020 --> 00:13:13,180
Ni's talented, isn't she?

367
00:13:13,180 --> 00:13:14,740
She runs her own business.
So capable.

368
00:13:14,740 --> 00:13:15,620
Don't worry.

369
00:13:15,620 --> 00:13:17,300
It's pointless.

370
00:13:17,560 --> 00:13:20,220
She doesn't know how to date.
Every relationship she starts fails.

371
00:13:20,220 --> 00:13:20,860
Mom,

372
00:13:20,860 --> 00:13:22,340
stop introducing me

373
00:13:22,340 --> 00:13:23,260
to those weird guys

374
00:13:23,260 --> 00:13:24,940
with weird looks.

375
00:13:24,940 --> 00:13:26,180
I want to date a decent guy.

376
00:13:26,180 --> 00:13:27,540
Introduce someone like Feng Jianqi.

377
00:13:27,540 --> 00:13:29,780
You'd need that kind of luck first.

378
00:13:29,780 --> 00:13:31,380
Dad, let me help you.

379
00:13:32,140 --> 00:13:33,060
No. It's dirty.

380
00:13:34,340 --> 00:13:35,540
- Jianqi, you're here.
- Mom.

381
00:13:35,540 --> 00:13:36,340
Hello, everyone.

382
00:13:36,660 --> 00:13:37,820
I'm here to pick up Mingzhu.

383
00:13:38,160 --> 00:13:38,980
You're here, Jianqi.

384
00:13:38,980 --> 00:13:40,820
There's only one Feng Jianqi.

385
00:13:41,540 --> 00:13:42,420
Go on.

386
00:13:42,820 --> 00:13:44,020
"There's only one Feng Jianqi."

387
00:13:44,020 --> 00:13:44,820
We're leaving.

388
00:13:44,980 --> 00:13:46,020
Come back early.

389
00:13:46,420 --> 00:13:47,740
Have fun.

390
00:13:47,960 --> 00:13:49,140
Look how lovey-dovey they are.

391
00:13:49,140 --> 00:13:50,340
Look at them,

392
00:13:50,340 --> 00:13:51,380
and look at you.

393
00:13:51,380 --> 00:13:52,340
What's wrong with me?

394
00:13:52,340 --> 00:13:53,300
I'm perfectly fine.

395
00:13:53,300 --> 00:13:53,940
Try harder.

396
00:13:53,940 --> 00:13:55,740
These things depend on fate.

397
00:13:56,700 --> 00:13:58,060
I have to keep an eye on you,

398
00:13:58,060 --> 00:13:59,700
or someone's going to steal you away.

399
00:14:00,540 --> 00:14:01,500
We're legally married.

400
00:14:01,500 --> 00:14:02,500
No one steals me away.

401
00:14:03,740 --> 00:14:04,660
Right, dear.

402
00:14:05,420 --> 00:14:07,660
My parents want to visit your parents

403
00:14:07,660 --> 00:14:08,700
and discuss the wedding.

404
00:14:09,060 --> 00:14:10,460
Is this weekend okay?

405
00:14:10,460 --> 00:14:12,780
Why did they suddenly
change their attitude?

406
00:14:13,860 --> 00:14:16,140
Do they know I was adopted?

407
00:14:16,380 --> 00:14:17,420
Of course they know.

408
00:14:17,420 --> 00:14:19,300
They now think you're a lost princess.

409
00:14:20,060 --> 00:14:20,700
Really?

410
00:14:20,700 --> 00:14:21,420
Really.

411
00:14:24,660 --> 00:14:25,660
You know what, dear?

412
00:14:25,660 --> 00:14:26,780
I actually think

413
00:14:27,100 --> 00:14:28,860
happiness is really simple.

414
00:14:29,620 --> 00:14:31,500
I walk outside,
and the road feels familiar.

415
00:14:32,060 --> 00:14:34,180
I reach out,
and the person I love is there.

416
00:14:34,660 --> 00:14:36,260
I come home to warm food waiting

417
00:14:36,260 --> 00:14:38,380
and a house full of noise and family.

418
00:14:38,700 --> 00:14:39,660
We can

419
00:14:40,180 --> 00:14:42,300
earn a little, spend a little,
and save a little.

420
00:14:42,620 --> 00:14:44,340
Living a simple and steady life.

421
00:14:44,340 --> 00:14:45,620
I could do that forever.

422
00:14:46,620 --> 00:14:47,380
Me too.

423
00:14:48,260 --> 00:14:50,620
Ni, you'd better hurry up
and find someone.

424
00:14:50,940 --> 00:14:53,420
When you were little,
your grades were better than Mingzhu's.

425
00:14:53,700 --> 00:14:55,860
Now that you've grown up,
you can't fall behind.

426
00:14:55,860 --> 00:14:56,740
Yes, yes.

427
00:14:56,760 --> 00:14:58,660
The sooner you die,
the sooner you reincarnate.

428
00:14:59,670 --> 00:15:01,060
What nonsense are you talking about?

429
00:15:01,060 --> 00:15:02,300
I'm just kidding.

430
00:15:03,120 --> 00:15:05,180
Dad's photo has been hanging
on the wall for years,

431
00:15:05,180 --> 00:15:06,980
and he's still alive and kicking,
isn't he?

432
00:15:07,660 --> 00:15:10,020
The time hasn't come yet.

433
00:15:11,380 --> 00:15:13,860
You and Dad divorced.

434
00:15:14,060 --> 00:15:15,820
That means you were
never a good match.

435
00:15:16,140 --> 00:15:16,980
Not a good match?

436
00:15:16,990 --> 00:15:17,820
Even though we didn't match,

437
00:15:17,820 --> 00:15:19,940
that doesn't give Ni Debao the right
to fool around.

438
00:15:21,620 --> 00:15:22,380
Do the math.

439
00:15:22,380 --> 00:15:24,180
When did I divorce him?

440
00:15:24,180 --> 00:15:25,340
And when

441
00:15:25,340 --> 00:15:27,300
was Ni Xiaoni born?

442
00:15:27,300 --> 00:15:30,220
Once you count it out, you know exactly
when he and Xiaoni's mom

443
00:15:30,220 --> 00:15:31,500
started messing around.

444
00:15:31,820 --> 00:15:32,820
Shameless.

445
00:15:33,300 --> 00:15:34,980
He had an affair!

446
00:15:36,820 --> 00:15:38,940
He cheated on me,

447
00:15:38,940 --> 00:15:40,740
and after the divorce,
he just up and left.

448
00:15:40,740 --> 00:15:41,380
And me?

449
00:15:41,900 --> 00:15:43,420
I was the one left humiliated.

450
00:15:43,980 --> 00:15:45,500
My life has been suffering.

451
00:15:45,510 --> 00:15:49,100
Mom, even if life is hard for you,
you can't blame everything on him.

452
00:15:49,260 --> 00:15:50,220
It's been so many years.

453
00:15:50,220 --> 00:15:51,900
It's time to let go of the hate.

454
00:15:52,980 --> 00:15:54,220
You know nothing.

455
00:15:55,580 --> 00:15:56,620
Meow meow.

456
00:15:59,700 --> 00:16:00,340
Dad,

457
00:16:01,020 --> 00:16:02,180
please try to understand.

458
00:16:05,660 --> 00:16:08,700
(Ni's Clinic)

459
00:16:15,220 --> 00:16:18,140
Dad, Ni is offering incense
to you again.

460
00:16:21,220 --> 00:16:21,900
Xiaoni,

461
00:16:23,700 --> 00:16:25,460
look how filial your sister is.

462
00:16:26,020 --> 00:16:28,140
You must learn from her,

463
00:16:28,140 --> 00:16:28,940
okay?

464
00:16:28,940 --> 00:16:29,620
Okay.

465
00:16:31,260 --> 00:16:32,100
Learn what?

466
00:16:32,660 --> 00:16:34,020
Burn incense for you?

467
00:16:35,740 --> 00:16:37,460
Every day we open the window,

468
00:16:37,740 --> 00:16:39,660
the first thing we see is your photo.

469
00:16:40,820 --> 00:16:42,420
It's like we're living with a ghost.

470
00:16:44,220 --> 00:16:46,180
Why don't you talk to Ni's mom?

471
00:16:46,500 --> 00:16:47,780
It's been so many years.

472
00:16:48,180 --> 00:16:49,420
Just let it go.

473
00:16:54,100 --> 00:16:55,940
If I could talk things out with her,

474
00:16:56,580 --> 00:16:58,140
why would you be here at all?

475
00:16:58,140 --> 00:16:58,700
You!

476
00:17:03,260 --> 00:17:04,020
What's it?

477
00:17:04,700 --> 00:17:06,420
Can your roof still hold up?

478
00:17:06,420 --> 00:17:09,130
Even your memorial portrait could hang
up there, why wouldn't my roof hold?

479
00:17:09,140 --> 00:17:10,060
You spitfire.

480
00:17:13,740 --> 00:17:16,340
Let me tell you something strange.

481
00:17:16,580 --> 00:17:18,220
I went to the countryside
for a funeral.

482
00:17:19,060 --> 00:17:20,600
We waited three days and three nights,

483
00:17:20,740 --> 00:17:22,260
and the old lady still hasn't passed.

484
00:17:22,740 --> 00:17:25,100
All the relatives
only took three days off.

485
00:17:25,220 --> 00:17:26,460
They're getting anxious.

486
00:17:29,180 --> 00:17:30,780
The wick hasn't burned out yet.

487
00:17:31,540 --> 00:17:33,740
Those five years of high school
didn't go to waste, huh?

488
00:17:34,300 --> 00:17:36,220
But nobody uses oil lamps anymore.

489
00:17:36,540 --> 00:17:37,740
So everyone starts guessing

490
00:17:37,740 --> 00:17:39,500
what she's waiting for.

491
00:17:39,660 --> 00:17:41,580
Is she waiting for her grandson
in the US?

492
00:17:41,980 --> 00:17:43,100
But that grandson

493
00:17:43,100 --> 00:17:45,100
broke his rib playing basketball.

494
00:17:45,820 --> 00:17:46,980
He can barely get out of bed,

495
00:17:46,980 --> 00:17:48,160
let alone come to the funeral.

496
00:17:53,260 --> 00:17:54,060
Mr. Ni,

497
00:17:54,620 --> 00:17:56,380
you want me to pretend
to be that grandson?

498
00:17:56,900 --> 00:17:57,540
Clever.

499
00:17:57,540 --> 00:17:59,060
My sister just got married,

500
00:17:59,160 --> 00:18:00,720
and you want me to go to a funeral now?

501
00:18:00,720 --> 00:18:02,340
If my dad finds out,
he'll break my legs.

502
00:18:02,340 --> 00:18:03,660
There's money.

503
00:18:04,560 --> 00:18:06,140
Besides, the old lady's over a hundred.

504
00:18:06,140 --> 00:18:07,740
That counts as a celebratory funeral.

505
00:18:10,500 --> 00:18:11,340
Will that be a lot?

506
00:18:11,580 --> 00:18:13,300
When have I ever shorted you?

507
00:18:15,380 --> 00:18:16,380

562
00:20:08,860 --> 00:20:09,580
Mom,

563
00:20:09,580 --> 00:20:11,020
when is this going to end?

564
00:20:11,020 --> 00:20:13,020
I want to go back
and play with Wang Ziqian.

565
00:20:13,660 --> 00:20:14,340
Zhang Hao,

566
00:20:14,740 --> 00:20:15,660
her hairpin.

567
00:20:15,670 --> 00:20:16,660
My grandma is sinking fast,

568
00:20:16,660 --> 00:20:17,500
and you still used that color.

569
00:20:17,500 --> 00:20:18,060
I forgot.

570
00:20:20,280 --> 00:20:21,380
We talked about this before.

571
00:20:21,380 --> 00:20:22,220
Seriously?

572
00:20:22,380 --> 00:20:23,660
Can you be a bit helpful?

573
00:20:23,660 --> 00:20:24,380
I'll do it.

574
00:20:24,380 --> 00:20:25,140
Fill the bottles.

575
00:20:25,140 --> 00:20:25,740
Okay.

576
00:20:25,740 --> 00:20:26,900
Be careful.

577
00:20:26,900 --> 00:20:28,500
Don't get too close to the fire?

578
00:20:28,500 --> 00:20:28,980
Okay.

579
00:20:28,980 --> 00:20:29,580
Good.

580
00:20:29,740 --> 00:20:30,260
Kids,

581
00:20:30,260 --> 00:20:31,260
don't play here.

582
00:20:31,260 --> 00:20:32,060
Go somewhere else.

583
00:20:34,700 --> 00:20:38,370
♪Return home in the dream♪

584
00:20:39,500 --> 00:20:41,460
Mom,

585
00:20:42,060 --> 00:20:44,300
all of the siblings

586
00:20:44,540 --> 00:20:46,780
are here. We're all here.

587
00:20:46,780 --> 00:20:47,260
Mom.

588
00:20:47,460 --> 00:20:48,140
Mom.

589
00:20:48,140 --> 00:20:49,740
Jun is on his way.

590
00:20:49,980 --> 00:20:51,420
He'll be here soon.

591
00:20:54,340 --> 00:20:55,220
The boy's here.

592
00:20:55,780 --> 00:20:56,580
He's too skinny.

593
00:20:56,940 --> 00:20:58,300
No flesh on him.

594
00:20:59,060 --> 00:20:59,980
What do we do then?

595
00:21:00,580 --> 00:21:01,620
No idea.

596
00:21:01,620 --> 00:21:02,940
Jingxiang.

597
00:21:02,940 --> 00:21:04,100
What do you want to say?

598
00:21:05,020 --> 00:21:05,700
Dacheng.

599
00:21:05,700 --> 00:21:06,780
Alright.

600
00:21:07,140 --> 00:21:08,620
Dacheng? Dacheng!

601
00:21:09,020 --> 00:21:09,740
Mom's calling you.

602
00:21:11,740 --> 00:21:13,820
You two stay.

603
00:21:13,940 --> 00:21:14,820
We'll stay.

604
00:21:15,140 --> 00:21:17,260
The rest

605
00:21:18,500 --> 00:21:21,740
go out.

606
00:21:22,260 --> 00:21:23,020
Mr. Ni,

607
00:21:23,250 --> 00:21:24,340
do you still need me here?

608
00:21:25,060 --> 00:21:26,260
Doesn't look like it.

609
00:21:26,710 --> 00:21:27,780
I'm going to the bathroom.

610
00:21:27,780 --> 00:21:28,300
Go.

611
00:21:28,300 --> 00:21:29,020
They came out.

612
00:21:29,660 --> 00:21:30,740
Why are you all coming out?

613
00:21:30,740 --> 00:21:31,460
They're out.

614
00:21:31,460 --> 00:21:33,180
Why did Mom

615
00:21:33,660 --> 00:21:35,740
ask Jingxiang and her husband to stay?

616
00:21:36,140 --> 00:21:38,340
Is she giving them her last words?

617
00:21:39,020 --> 00:21:39,700
Well.

618
00:21:39,700 --> 00:21:40,380
Eldest brother,

619
00:21:41,100 --> 00:21:44,220
is she leaving them something?

620
00:21:44,220 --> 00:21:44,940
No.

621
00:21:45,380 --> 00:21:48,100
Mom never worked.
She saved every penny her whole life.

622
00:21:48,100 --> 00:21:49,020
Do you want the old house

623
00:21:49,020 --> 00:21:50,100
which is the only thing she has?

624
00:21:50,100 --> 00:21:51,140
Hey.

625
00:21:53,700 --> 00:22:00,620
I'm so sorry.

626
00:22:04,100 --> 00:22:06,420
I'm so sorry.

627
00:22:07,220 --> 00:22:08,220
What?

628
00:22:13,660 --> 00:22:16,020
My daughter!

629
00:22:16,020 --> 00:22:17,620
Is Mom calling me?

630
00:22:18,300 --> 00:22:20,860
How could you do that?

631
00:22:21,700 --> 00:22:23,060
Give me back my daughter!

632
00:22:34,500 --> 00:22:38,100
Mom!

633
00:22:41,460 --> 00:22:42,260
Mom!

634
00:22:42,580 --> 00:22:43,540
Get ready.

635
00:22:44,180 --> 00:22:45,950
It's a celebratory funeral!
Make it lively!

636
00:23:00,900 --> 00:23:04,260
(Nanxi Hotel)

637
00:23:13,380 --> 00:23:14,060
Mom.

638
00:23:16,060 --> 00:23:16,700
Sit.

639
00:23:21,980 --> 00:23:23,260
The wedding hasn't been held yet.

640
00:23:23,900 --> 00:23:24,980
Call me Mrs. Feng.

641
00:23:28,460 --> 00:23:29,140
Mrs. Feng,

642
00:23:30,140 --> 00:23:31,650
what did you want to talk to me about?

643
00:23:31,960 --> 00:23:33,850
You're pregnant now.
Why are you still working?

644
00:23:33,860 --> 00:23:35,180
I'm good.

645
00:23:35,180 --> 00:23:36,180
I haven't felt anything.

646
00:23:36,780 --> 00:23:38,620
No morning sickness so far.

647
00:23:38,940 --> 00:23:39,860
Impressive.

648
00:23:40,380 --> 00:23:42,660
The daughter of a restaurant owner

649
00:23:42,820 --> 00:23:43,900
is tough indeed.

650
00:23:46,660 --> 00:23:48,340
But you're pregnant now.

651
00:23:48,340 --> 00:23:50,620
You need to take care of yourself.

652
00:23:51,420 --> 00:23:53,300
This is a top-grade bird's nest.

653
00:23:53,660 --> 00:23:55,340
Meiqi and I have been eating it.

654
00:23:55,740 --> 00:23:56,780
You should have some too.

655
00:23:57,580 --> 00:23:58,900
Have you had a bird's nest before?

656
00:23:59,660 --> 00:24:01,020
Does your mom know how to cook it?

657
00:24:02,860 --> 00:24:04,220
I've never had it,

658
00:24:04,540 --> 00:24:05,620
and I don't really want it.

659
00:24:05,860 --> 00:24:07,220
My mom doesn't know how to cook it.

660
00:24:07,220 --> 00:24:07,940
She should learn.

661
00:24:08,940 --> 00:24:10,500
It's easy.

662
00:24:10,780 --> 00:24:11,660
Have your mom learn.

663
00:24:12,580 --> 00:24:13,900
You need to nourish your body.

664
00:24:14,820 --> 00:24:17,460
You're carrying
the Feng family's grandson.

665
00:24:18,260 --> 00:24:19,420
It could be a girl.

666
00:24:19,420 --> 00:24:20,500
That's fine.

667
00:24:20,940 --> 00:24:23,220
Whether it's a boy or a girl,
I'll love them.

668
00:24:23,700 --> 00:24:26,660
Anyway, you can have more kids now.

669
00:24:27,140 --> 00:24:28,540
Just focus on giving birth.

670
00:24:28,540 --> 00:24:29,920
We'll help you raise the children.

671
00:24:29,940 --> 00:24:31,980
Don't feel any pressure.

672
00:24:32,260 --> 00:24:33,300
I don't feel pressured.

673
00:24:33,620 --> 00:24:35,380
As long as it's my child,
I'll love them.

674
00:24:35,380 --> 00:24:36,340
Of course.

675
00:24:37,140 --> 00:24:38,300
All parents

676
00:24:38,620 --> 00:24:40,780
love their own children the most.

677
00:24:42,060 --> 00:24:43,220
When Jianqi graduated,

678
00:24:43,220 --> 00:24:45,060
we bought him a new apartment.

679
00:24:45,500 --> 00:24:48,260
The deed only has his name on it.

680
00:24:49,420 --> 00:24:50,460
You know that, right?

681
00:24:50,460 --> 00:24:51,220
I do.

682
00:24:51,500 --> 00:24:53,140
I won't ask to have my name added.

683
00:24:55,860 --> 00:24:56,580
Good.

684
00:25:01,580 --> 00:25:02,860
I came today

685
00:25:03,220 --> 00:25:05,260
because

686
00:25:05,740 --> 00:25:08,020
Jianqi's dad and I will
visit your family

687
00:25:08,020 --> 00:25:09,180
this Saturday.

688
00:25:10,540 --> 00:25:13,340
I was worried your parents
might feel uncomfortable,

689
00:25:13,340 --> 00:25:15,100
so I wanted to ask you first.

690
00:25:15,900 --> 00:25:19,220
Have your biological parents
come to look for you?

691
00:25:20,700 --> 00:25:21,380
No.

692
00:25:22,220 --> 00:25:24,460
I've always felt my parents
are my real parents.

693
00:25:24,460 --> 00:25:25,620
That's how you feel.

694
00:25:26,180 --> 00:25:27,380
But what if they show up

695
00:25:27,380 --> 00:25:28,740
after you get married?

696
00:25:29,780 --> 00:25:30,580
I don't know.

697
00:25:31,520 --> 00:25:32,940
We'll deal with it when it happens.

698
00:25:33,960 --> 00:25:36,100
If you don't think ahead,
you'll soon run into trouble.

699
00:25:36,100 --> 00:25:37,220
You know that, don't you?

700
00:25:38,940 --> 00:25:40,620
Marrying into a family like ours,

701
00:25:40,620 --> 00:25:43,180
you need to start thinking long-term.

702
00:25:49,180 --> 00:25:50,340
I understand, Mrs. Feng.

703
00:26:13,220 --> 00:26:13,860
Dad.

704
00:26:14,860 --> 00:26:16,100
Have you got all the furniture?

705
00:26:16,100 --> 00:26:17,700
Yes. Just bought a new bed.

706
00:26:17,700 --> 00:26:18,450
What do you think?

707
00:26:22,540 --> 00:26:23,500
It's sturdy.

708
00:26:24,780 --> 00:26:25,720
It only looks like so.

709
00:26:26,820 --> 00:26:29,100
You should've bought solid wood
in the furniture market.

710
00:26:29,780 --> 00:26:30,620
Mingzhu likes it.

711
00:26:33,740 --> 00:26:34,380
And you?

712
00:26:35,580 --> 00:26:36,780
If she likes it, I like it.

713
00:26:40,060 --> 00:26:41,260
I'll let you get back to it.

714
00:26:41,420 --> 00:26:42,060
Sure.

715
00:26:49,700 --> 00:26:50,140
Mr. Feng.

716
00:26:50,140 --> 00:26:51,160
You're here, Mingzhu.

717
00:26:51,780 --> 00:26:53,020
The elevator needs a keycard,

718
00:26:53,020 --> 00:26:54,460
so Jianqi got me one.

719
00:26:54,460 --> 00:26:55,700
Right, you need one.

720
00:26:55,700 --> 00:26:56,940
Otherwise, it's inconvenient.

721
00:26:58,420 --> 00:27:00,540
Why did I hear someone
still calling "Mr. Feng"?

722
00:27:01,080 --> 00:27:02,860
It's just a form of address.
Doesn't matter.

723
00:27:03,140 --> 00:27:04,840
I'll leave you guys to it.
I'll head back.

724
00:27:07,660 --> 00:27:08,500
Are you tired today?

725
00:27:08,780 --> 00:27:09,420
No.

726
00:27:13,980 --> 00:27:15,580
Your mom came.

727
00:27:15,820 --> 00:27:16,740
I called her "Mom,"

728
00:27:17,060 --> 00:27:20,340
and she said I should wait
until after the wedding banquet.

729
00:27:22,860 --> 00:27:23,980
What's wrong with her?

730
00:27:25,980 --> 00:27:27,140
Did she give you a hard time?

731
00:27:28,060 --> 00:27:29,900
No. She gave me a bird's nest.

732
00:27:35,050 --> 00:27:38,230
♪What you said before♪

733
00:27:38,300 --> 00:27:39,100
Done.

734
00:27:40,380 --> 00:27:41,060
Well done.

735
00:27:41,420 --> 00:27:42,460
It feels great.

736
00:27:43,660 --> 00:27:46,420
We can hang our wedding photo
on this wall.

737
00:27:47,820 --> 00:27:49,220
Isn't it usually hung over the bed?

738
00:27:49,220 --> 00:27:50,180
Why would you hang it here?

739
00:27:50,180 --> 00:27:52,620
So that I can see this picture
when I lie down.

740
00:27:52,620 --> 00:27:54,180
Just thinking about it makes me happy.

741
00:27:54,940 --> 00:27:56,980
It doesn't take much to make you happy.

742
00:27:59,460 --> 00:28:01,460
There's a custom back in my hometown.

743
00:28:01,460 --> 00:28:02,520
At weddings and funerals,

744
00:28:02,520 --> 00:28:04,820
the person with the most blessings
sits at the main table.

745
00:28:04,820 --> 00:28:06,260
I'm the blessed person now.

746
00:28:06,540 --> 00:28:07,260
Look.

747
00:28:07,500 --> 00:28:09,460
I have a father, a mother, a sister,

748
00:28:09,460 --> 00:28:11,460
a wife, and a child on the way.

749
00:28:13,420 --> 00:28:15,140
Then I'm also a blessed person.

750
00:28:17,100 --> 00:28:17,900
Baby,

751
00:28:18,620 --> 00:28:20,640
your mom and dad

752
00:28:20,640 --> 00:28:23,100
get to sit at the main table
and get served eat the best food

753
00:28:23,100 --> 00:28:24,860
whenever they go.

754
00:28:27,140 --> 00:28:28,060
Say, dear,

755
00:28:28,820 --> 00:28:30,460
if you find your birth parents,

756
00:28:30,460 --> 00:28:32,180
you'll have four parents.

757
00:28:32,820 --> 00:28:33,940
That's Blessed Pro.

758
00:28:35,420 --> 00:28:37,420
And maybe a bunch of siblings,

759
00:28:37,820 --> 00:28:39,180
nieces, and nephews.

760
00:28:40,100 --> 00:28:41,580
That'd be incredible.

761
00:28:41,580 --> 00:28:43,140
The Queen of the Blessed.

762
00:28:43,380 --> 00:28:46,140
Blessed Pro Max.

763
00:28:47,380 --> 00:28:51,140
Please have the family's blessed person
burn the paper to show respect.

764
00:29:02,500 --> 00:29:03,260
Grandma,

765
00:29:04,300 --> 00:29:06,940
Yu Jun broke his rib
and can't come back.

766
00:29:08,420 --> 00:29:09,980
I'll pay respect on his behalf.

767
00:29:12,340 --> 00:29:13,500
May you rest in peace.

768
00:29:13,500 --> 00:29:15,060
(Forever in Our Hearts)

769
00:29:17,380 --> 00:29:21,660
(In Mourning)

770
00:29:21,660 --> 00:29:23,340
Family and friends,

771
00:29:23,940 --> 00:29:25,220
please bow.

772
00:29:26,460 --> 00:29:28,140
Grandma loved Yu Jun the most.

773
00:29:28,860 --> 00:29:30,940
She couldn't even close her eyes.

774
00:29:32,420 --> 00:29:33,580
Bow again.

775
00:29:36,900 --> 00:29:38,460
It wasn't because of him.

776
00:29:39,380 --> 00:29:41,140
You have a sister.

777
00:29:42,300 --> 00:29:44,060
Bow again.

778
00:29:49,100 --> 00:29:50,060
What sister?

779
00:29:51,180 --> 00:29:52,180
Zhidong,

780
00:29:53,140 --> 00:29:53,860
you have

781
00:29:54,860 --> 00:29:57,780
a twin sister.

782
00:29:58,420 --> 00:29:59,900
Please observe a moment of silence.

783
00:30:02,380 --> 00:30:04,420
My second daughter.

784
00:30:06,860 --> 00:30:07,940
There, there.

785
00:30:08,140 --> 00:30:09,340
There, there, Mom.

786
00:30:10,380 --> 00:30:10,940
Not bad.

787
00:30:10,940 --> 00:30:13,780
Look. The building has a vintage look,
and there are flowers everywhere.

788
00:30:13,940 --> 00:30:14,420
Right?

789
00:30:14,620 --> 00:30:16,860
Mustard greens with shredded pork.

790
00:30:16,860 --> 00:30:17,540
Thank you, Xiu'e.

791
00:30:17,540 --> 00:30:18,580
Alright. Thank you.

792
00:30:21,020 --> 00:30:23,140
Vegetable with fragrant mushrooms
is their specialty.

793
00:30:23,140 --> 00:30:23,980
Try it.

794
00:30:24,860 --> 00:30:25,940
Besides,

795
00:30:25,940 --> 00:30:27,500
the environment and the design...

796
00:30:27,500 --> 00:30:28,300
Look at Mingzhu.

797
00:30:28,860 --> 00:30:30,580
She breezed through

798
00:30:30,940 --> 00:30:31,780
Grade 10 piano.

799
00:30:31,780 --> 00:30:33,060
You never let me learn.

800
00:30:33,860 --> 00:30:34,940
If I'd learned,

801
00:30:34,940 --> 00:30:36,380
I would've passed it too.

802
00:30:36,380 --> 00:30:37,420
Oh, come on.

803
00:30:37,740 --> 00:30:38,660
Grade 10?

804
00:30:39,210 --> 00:30:41,900
Your mom and I will be grateful enough
if you don't repeat the year.

805
00:30:43,380 --> 00:30:44,100
Mr. Shen,

806
00:30:44,660 --> 00:30:46,060
here's what you asked for.

807
00:30:46,660 --> 00:30:47,180
There we go.

808
00:30:48,140 --> 00:30:49,180
- Let me see.
- It's here.

809
00:30:49,380 --> 00:30:49,980
How's it?

810
00:30:50,820 --> 00:30:52,420
Let me see.

811
00:30:52,780 --> 00:30:53,740
Check if this is right.

812
00:30:55,340 --> 00:30:56,350
Thank you so much, Wang.

813
00:30:56,560 --> 00:30:57,460
Here, have a cigarette.

814
00:30:57,460 --> 00:30:58,380
No, thanks.

815
00:30:59,620 --> 00:31:00,460
Shen, look at this.

816
00:31:04,540 --> 00:31:05,900
These are not wild sea cucumbers.

817
00:31:06,100 --> 00:31:06,860
I'll be honest.

818
00:31:06,860 --> 00:31:08,140
Wild ones are rare.

819
00:31:08,140 --> 00:31:09,060
It needs luck.

820
00:31:09,220 --> 00:31:10,940
These here are top-quality.

821
00:31:12,220 --> 00:31:13,740
The abalones

822
00:31:14,380 --> 00:31:15,340
are too small.

823
00:31:15,340 --> 00:31:16,300
Bigger abalones

824
00:31:16,300 --> 00:31:17,100
aren't worth it.

825
00:31:17,100 --> 00:31:18,540
They're too expensive.

826
00:31:18,820 --> 00:31:20,100
Expensive is fine.

827
00:31:20,500 --> 00:31:21,820
We don't mind.

828
00:31:21,820 --> 00:31:23,300
We're having important guests.

829
00:31:23,300 --> 00:31:23,860
Exactly.

830
00:31:23,860 --> 00:31:24,780
It's fine.

831
00:31:24,780 --> 00:31:25,860
These are good enough.

832
00:31:25,860 --> 00:31:27,020
No. They're too small.

833
00:31:27,020 --> 00:31:28,780
I'll go exchange them.

834
00:31:29,220 --> 00:31:29,940
I'll do it.

835
00:31:29,940 --> 00:31:30,460
Alright.

836
00:31:30,460 --> 00:31:31,660
Thank you, Wang.

837
00:31:31,960 --> 00:31:32,660
Sorry about that.

838
00:31:32,660 --> 00:31:33,860
Don't say that. We're friends.

839
00:31:34,100 --> 00:31:34,860
Thank you.

840
00:31:35,100 --> 00:31:37,020
(In Loving Memory)

841
00:31:37,060 --> 00:31:37,660
Mr. Zhang,

842
00:31:38,060 --> 00:31:41,580
do you want to keep those
leftover cigarettes, wine, and drinks,

843
00:31:41,580 --> 00:31:43,180
or should I return them?

844
00:31:45,140 --> 00:31:46,060
I'll ask.

845
00:31:47,260 --> 00:31:47,780
Zhixia.

846
00:31:48,700 --> 00:31:49,340
Zhixia.

847
00:31:49,540 --> 00:31:50,700
The person in charge is asking

848
00:31:50,700 --> 00:31:53,020
what to do with
the leftover beers and cigarettes.

849
00:31:53,340 --> 00:31:54,820
Mom, sit for bit.

850
00:31:56,710 --> 00:31:57,420
What was it again?

851
00:31:57,420 --> 00:31:59,560
Should we return
those leftover beers and cigarettes?

852
00:32:00,280 --> 00:32:02,320
Why are you asking me
about something this trivial?

853
00:32:02,500 --> 00:32:03,620
You ask me about everything.

854
00:32:03,620 --> 00:32:04,940
Can't you help me out for once?

855
00:32:04,940 --> 00:32:06,260
Can't you see I'm busy?

856
00:32:08,220 --> 00:32:09,420
What would you do without me?

857
00:32:12,420 --> 00:32:14,580
My wife has a quick temper.

858
00:32:14,900 --> 00:32:16,220
She gets fired up easily.

859
00:32:16,510 --> 00:32:18,680
I suspect she has
ascendant hyperactivity of the liver.

860
00:32:19,220 --> 00:32:20,300
Not necessarily.

861
00:32:20,540 --> 00:32:21,740
Let me take her pulse.

862
00:32:21,740 --> 00:32:22,780
You can do that?

863
00:32:23,300 --> 00:32:24,220
Mrs. Zhang,

864
00:32:25,140 --> 00:32:27,620
your complexion doesn't look great.

865
00:32:28,260 --> 00:32:30,260
How about I take your pulse?

866
00:32:31,300 --> 00:32:32,780
Your business scope is quite wide.

867
00:32:33,180 --> 00:32:35,020
Treating patients is my main job.

868
00:32:35,260 --> 00:32:36,100
Let him try.

869
00:32:46,020 --> 00:32:46,780
Well?

870
00:32:47,900 --> 00:32:48,820
Oh my.

871
00:32:49,260 --> 00:32:50,500
It's pregnancy pulse.

872
00:32:52,420 --> 00:32:53,820
Pregnancy pulse?

873
00:32:53,820 --> 00:32:54,700
Yeah, pregnancy pulse.

874
00:32:55,020 --> 00:32:56,740
What's that, Mom?

875
00:32:56,740 --> 00:32:58,660
You're getting a little sibling.

876
00:32:59,460 --> 00:33:00,460
Let me check it again.

877
00:33:02,020 --> 00:33:03,420
I don't want a sibling.

878
00:33:03,420 --> 00:33:04,460
I want a dog.

879
00:33:07,700 --> 00:33:08,660
You can just raise me.

880
00:33:12,700 --> 00:33:14,780
Xiu'e, Mr. Shen.

881
00:33:15,880 --> 00:33:16,380
You're here.

882
00:33:16,380 --> 00:33:18,740
The loquats they're selling
at the entrance are pretty good.

883
00:33:19,380 --> 00:33:20,060
Freshly picked.

884
00:33:20,060 --> 00:33:22,300
I saw Wang just now.

885
00:33:22,300 --> 00:33:23,220
What's going on here?

886
00:33:23,380 --> 00:33:26,100
Are you going to prepare a whole feast?

887
00:33:26,100 --> 00:33:26,980
No.

888
00:33:26,980 --> 00:33:29,220
Xiu'e still thinks it's not enough.

889
00:33:29,660 --> 00:33:31,020
Our in-laws

890
00:33:31,020 --> 00:33:32,660
are no ordinary people.

891
00:33:33,020 --> 00:33:34,380
We can't just serve any old meal.

892
00:33:34,380 --> 00:33:35,460
Any old meal?

893
00:33:35,940 --> 00:33:37,740
My cooking is top-notch.

894
00:33:37,940 --> 00:33:39,980
They only get flavors like mine
at the Hilton.

895
00:33:41,060 --> 00:33:42,100
Stop bragging.

896
00:33:42,100 --> 00:33:43,220
Bragging costs you nothing.

897
00:33:43,980 --> 00:33:46,620
Shen does have some skills.

898
00:33:46,620 --> 00:33:47,700
You know me.

899
00:33:48,740 --> 00:33:49,700
Look at this.

900
00:33:50,100 --> 00:33:50,740
I suspect

901
00:33:50,740 --> 00:33:52,420
they're looking for Mingzhu.

902
00:33:54,260 --> 00:33:54,940
What's this?

903
00:33:56,260 --> 00:33:58,380
(Family Search Notice)

904
00:34:02,260 --> 00:34:04,900
(Dad and Mom are looking for you.
We hope you can come home soon.)

905
00:34:07,740 --> 00:34:08,420
Mom,

906
00:34:09,020 --> 00:34:11,620
I've given my second daughter a name.

907
00:34:11,940 --> 00:34:12,980
Zhilu.

908
00:34:14,540 --> 00:34:18,460
I hope she knows the way home.

909
00:34:19,140 --> 00:34:21,660
My girl didn't get lost by herself.

910
00:34:22,380 --> 00:34:24,820
Your mother who gave her away.

911
00:34:25,080 --> 00:34:27,460
If anyone needs to find their way,
it should be your mother.

912
00:34:27,460 --> 00:34:29,080
How is my girl supposed
to find anything?

913
00:34:29,580 --> 00:34:30,820
I really don't understand.

914
00:34:31,180 --> 00:34:33,660
How could she hide something this big
right up until she died?

915
00:34:33,660 --> 00:34:35,260
You're the one to blame.

916
00:34:35,260 --> 00:34:36,500
You got arrested for fighting

917
00:34:36,500 --> 00:34:38,060
and went to prison for years.

918
00:34:38,220 --> 00:34:40,260
That's why my mother
gave the child away.

919
00:34:40,260 --> 00:34:41,780
It's your fault.

920
00:34:42,060 --> 00:34:43,260
Nonsense!

921
00:34:43,260 --> 00:34:44,500
You talk nonsense!

922
00:34:44,550 --> 00:34:46,460
There are tons of people
who've been to jail.

923
00:34:46,460 --> 00:34:48,060
That doesn't mean

924
00:34:48,060 --> 00:34:49,260
my mother-in-law

925
00:34:49,260 --> 00:34:51,060
could just hand my daughter
to someone else.

926
00:34:51,060 --> 00:34:52,540
I'm telling you, Yu Jingxiang.

927
00:34:52,540 --> 00:34:54,060
If we can't get our daughter back,

928
00:34:54,300 --> 00:34:56,340
I'll never visit your mother's grave.

929
00:34:56,340 --> 00:34:57,780
No one with the surname Xu is going.

930
00:34:57,780 --> 00:35:00,340
Dad, going to prison isn't
something to brag about.

931
00:35:00,340 --> 00:35:01,580
I heard you from far away.

932
00:35:01,580 --> 00:35:03,780
Stop arguing. It's only been a few days
since Grandma died.

933
00:35:03,780 --> 00:35:04,380
Gosh.

934
00:35:04,380 --> 00:35:05,420
You're a Xu.

935
00:35:05,700 --> 00:35:06,860
You can't go.

936
00:35:07,060 --> 00:35:08,380
What's wrong with being a Xu?

937
00:35:08,580 --> 00:35:09,980
Is being a Xu such a big deal now?

938
00:35:09,980 --> 00:35:11,850
Anyone with the surname Xu
aren't allowed to go?

939
00:35:13,020 --> 00:35:13,740
Zhidong,

940
00:35:13,740 --> 00:35:15,220
don't listen to your dad.

941
00:35:15,380 --> 00:35:16,340
Listen.

942
00:35:16,500 --> 00:35:18,020
Back then,

943
00:35:18,020 --> 00:35:19,340
you had a high fever,

944
00:35:19,340 --> 00:35:19,820
you know?

945
00:35:19,820 --> 00:35:21,780
You almost died.

946
00:35:21,780 --> 00:35:23,300
Your grandma stayed by your side,

947
00:35:23,300 --> 00:35:25,140
wiping your chest and your back
with hot water,

948
00:35:25,140 --> 00:35:27,180
watching over you day and night
for seven whole days.

949
00:35:27,180 --> 00:35:29,420
She pulled you back from death's door.

950
00:35:29,860 --> 00:35:31,540
Without her, there wouldn't be you.

951
00:35:31,540 --> 00:35:32,220
You understand?

952
00:35:32,220 --> 00:35:33,060
Yes, I know.

953
00:35:33,060 --> 00:35:33,580
Zhidong.

954
00:35:33,780 --> 00:35:35,300
Without me, there wouldn't be you.

955
00:35:35,300 --> 00:35:35,580
Jeez,

956
00:35:35,580 --> 00:35:36,340
your grandma

957
00:35:36,340 --> 00:35:38,020
favored boys over girls.

958
00:35:38,020 --> 00:35:38,340
I...

959
00:35:38,340 --> 00:35:40,580
Your twin sister was sent away
because of you.

960
00:35:40,580 --> 00:35:42,420
If we never find her,

961
00:35:42,420 --> 00:35:44,740
you're not going to marry someone.

962
00:35:44,740 --> 00:35:46,340
Fine, fine. It's all my fault.

963
00:35:46,340 --> 00:35:46,900
What does this

964
00:35:46,900 --> 00:35:49,260
have to do with Zhidong?

965
00:35:50,460 --> 00:35:51,580
Are you out of your mind?

966
00:35:51,580 --> 00:35:53,260
You're barking at anyone.

967
00:35:53,260 --> 00:35:54,060
Back then,

968
00:35:54,420 --> 00:35:56,860
I was in an emergency,

969
00:35:57,420 --> 00:35:59,180
and you were in prison.

970
00:35:59,420 --> 00:36:01,580
Taking care of three kids alone
was impossible.

971
00:36:01,780 --> 00:36:03,180
My mother had no choice.

972
00:36:03,180 --> 00:36:05,020
How is that "favoring boys over girls"?

973
00:36:06,020 --> 00:36:07,580
It was random.

974
00:36:09,460 --> 00:36:10,340
Yu Jingxiang,

975
00:36:10,900 --> 00:36:13,700
you gave your child away!

976
00:36:13,960 --> 00:36:14,980
And you call that random?

977
00:36:14,980 --> 00:36:16,380
Do you hear yourself?

978
00:36:16,380 --> 00:36:18,020
Were you drawing lottery tickets?

979
00:36:18,020 --> 00:36:19,020
Random, you say?

980
00:36:21,860 --> 00:36:24,180
Everyone knew

981
00:36:24,180 --> 00:36:25,300
your mother favored boys.

982
00:36:25,700 --> 00:36:28,300
Even the lady at the general store knew.

983
00:36:28,300 --> 00:36:29,460
When they were little,

984
00:36:29,460 --> 00:36:30,660
five candies for one yuan,

985
00:36:30,660 --> 00:36:32,500
he was always the one
who got the extra piece.

986
00:36:32,500 --> 00:36:34,020
If that's not favoritism, then what is?

987
00:36:35,720 --> 00:36:37,580
Yet you still
have the nerve to bring this up.

988
00:36:52,180 --> 00:36:53,100
Don't talk like that.

989
00:36:53,540 --> 00:36:56,180
How could I not know
how hard your mother had it?

990
00:36:56,780 --> 00:36:58,540
When she was bedridden all those years,

991
00:36:58,820 --> 00:37:00,900
I was the one who washed her

992
00:37:00,900 --> 00:37:02,020
and carried her

993
00:37:02,020 --> 00:37:03,260
up and down the hospital stairs,

994
00:37:03,260 --> 00:37:05,260
from the first floor to the fourth
and back again.

995
00:37:05,260 --> 00:37:06,380
You should have.

996
00:37:06,740 --> 00:37:08,100
You were paying for what you did.

997
00:37:08,140 --> 00:37:09,740
Then how does your mother pay for hers?

998
00:37:10,580 --> 00:37:12,940
Xu Dacheng, I'm telling you,
once Zhidong gets married,

999
00:37:12,940 --> 00:37:13,700
I'm

1000
00:37:13,700 --> 00:37:14,900
divorcing you.

1001
00:37:15,140 --> 00:37:17,060
Even if he doesn't,
I'll still divorce you.

1002
00:37:17,060 --> 00:37:19,340
Fine. Divorce, then!

1003
00:37:20,140 --> 00:37:24,340
How much is Ming's school bag?

1004
00:37:25,500 --> 00:37:26,500
360,000.

1005
00:37:27,260 --> 00:37:29,260
Ming's school bag cost 360,000?

1006
00:37:30,180 --> 00:37:31,180
What does his family do?

1007
00:37:31,180 --> 00:37:32,460
How can a school bag be 360,000?

1008
00:37:32,940 --> 00:37:33,780
They own a mine.

1009
00:37:35,740 --> 00:37:37,060
Erase it and do it again.

1010
00:37:37,500 --> 00:37:38,980
They own a mine?

1011
00:37:39,820 --> 00:37:40,580
What's the result?

1012
00:37:49,460 --> 00:37:50,100
Jiao,

1013
00:37:50,460 --> 00:37:52,420
you're going to be a big sister.

1014
00:37:52,420 --> 00:37:53,100
Look here.

1015
00:37:53,560 --> 00:37:55,540
Do you want a little brother
or a little sister?

1016
00:37:55,740 --> 00:37:56,740
I want a dog.

1017
00:37:57,140 --> 00:37:58,060
Oh, you kid.

1018
00:37:58,060 --> 00:37:58,780
Mom,

1019
00:37:59,020 --> 00:38:00,300
can we get a dog?

1020
00:38:00,680 --> 00:38:02,260
No matter if you have a sibling or not,

1021
00:38:02,260 --> 00:38:04,060
we're not getting a dog.

1022
00:38:04,780 --> 00:38:05,580
Why not?

1023
00:38:05,580 --> 00:38:07,060
Wang Ziqian has a dog.

1024
00:38:07,260 --> 00:38:08,820
She got full marks on her test.

1025
00:38:11,300 --> 00:38:11,980
Jiao,

1026
00:38:12,500 --> 00:38:14,140
don't make my wife upset.

1027
00:38:14,700 --> 00:38:15,740
Zhixia,

1028
00:38:15,740 --> 00:38:17,300
you can't talk to the girl like that.

1029
00:38:17,700 --> 00:38:19,540
I don't know how to raise kids at all,

1030
00:38:19,540 --> 00:38:20,980
so we can't have a second child.

1031
00:38:21,410 --> 00:38:22,580
My parents are fighting again.

1032
00:38:22,580 --> 00:38:23,820
I need to stabilize the situation.

1033
00:38:23,820 --> 00:38:24,820
Jiao, do your homework.

1034
00:38:24,820 --> 00:38:25,820
I'll check it later.

1035
00:38:26,620 --> 00:38:27,100
All right.

1036
00:38:27,100 --> 00:38:28,620
Be careful when you go out.

1037
00:38:28,620 --> 00:38:29,300
All right?

1038
00:38:29,300 --> 00:38:30,620
You're not alone now.

1039
00:38:31,100 --> 00:38:32,260
Are those flat shoes?

1040
00:38:32,620 --> 00:38:34,020
Good. Wear flats.

1041
00:38:35,340 --> 00:38:36,020
I'll go with you.

1042
00:38:36,020 --> 00:38:36,620
No need...

1043
00:38:37,660 --> 00:38:38,660
Hey, what are you doing?

1044
00:38:38,660 --> 00:38:39,420
Slow down.

1045
00:38:44,300 --> 00:38:44,980
Zhixia.

1046
00:38:46,140 --> 00:38:46,860
Put it out.

1047
00:38:54,180 --> 00:38:54,780
Dad,

1048
00:38:55,560 --> 00:38:57,300
Grandma was the one
who gave the baby away,

1049
00:38:57,300 --> 00:38:58,540
not Mom.

1050
00:38:58,540 --> 00:38:59,840
Why are you snapping at her?

1051
00:38:59,850 --> 00:39:00,900
You bark at the wrong tree.

1052
00:39:00,900 --> 00:39:02,060
Of course I know

1053
00:39:02,340 --> 00:39:04,580
I should be blaming your grandma.

1054
00:39:04,580 --> 00:39:05,980
But where am I supposed to find her?

1055
00:39:06,140 --> 00:39:08,300
I can't believe
she hid something this big.

1056
00:39:08,300 --> 00:39:09,780
She's a con artist!

1057
00:39:09,780 --> 00:39:10,140
Dad!

1058
00:39:10,140 --> 00:39:10,660
Zhixia,

1059
00:39:10,660 --> 00:39:13,100
listen to what nonsense he just said.

1060
00:39:13,340 --> 00:39:14,860
Mom, can you also stop?

1061
00:39:15,040 --> 00:39:16,980
You're all riled up
the second Zhixia comes back.

1062
00:39:16,980 --> 00:39:18,780
Whose side are you on, Zhidong?

1063
00:39:19,660 --> 00:39:21,740
Grandma should've
given you away instead.

1064
00:39:22,620 --> 00:39:24,980
Mom, can you stop attacking everyone?

1065
00:39:25,380 --> 00:39:26,740
Zhidong's doing fine now.

1066
00:39:26,740 --> 00:39:27,940
He knows how to work hard.

1067
00:39:27,940 --> 00:39:29,660
He's about to marry Bichen.

1068
00:39:29,660 --> 00:39:30,020
He's

1069
00:39:30,740 --> 00:39:31,660
a grown man.

1070
00:39:31,660 --> 00:39:32,860
Don't talk about him like that.

1071
00:39:34,020 --> 00:39:34,980
His twin sister

1072
00:39:34,980 --> 00:39:36,220
was sent away many years ago.

1073
00:39:36,220 --> 00:39:38,620
It's not like
she can be found overnight.

1074
00:39:39,100 --> 00:39:41,820
Besides, human traffickers
don't read newspapers now.

1075
00:39:42,020 --> 00:39:43,580
They won't call us.

1076
00:39:44,540 --> 00:39:46,380
I had Zhang Hao post a notice online.

1077
00:39:46,380 --> 00:39:47,940
Everyone can see it.

1078
00:39:48,440 --> 00:39:50,180
We'll definitely hear something.
Let's wait.

1079
00:39:52,380 --> 00:39:54,460
Yes, we'll wait for it.

1080
00:39:56,140 --> 00:39:57,060
Zhixia,

1081
00:39:57,900 --> 00:39:59,380
what if

1082
00:39:59,860 --> 00:40:02,500
she never comes back?

1083
00:40:02,500 --> 00:40:03,410
If she never comes back,

1084
00:40:03,420 --> 00:40:05,220
we'll all go confront your mother
down there.

1085
00:40:05,460 --> 00:40:06,540
Did you hear that?

1086
00:40:06,540 --> 00:40:08,220
I didn't even say anything, Zhixia.

1087
00:40:10,340 --> 00:40:11,340
If she doesn't come back,

1088
00:40:11,740 --> 00:40:13,380
that means she's living well.

1089
00:40:14,940 --> 00:40:16,380
Zhidong is her twin brother.

1090
00:40:16,680 --> 00:40:18,060
Now that Zhidong has a girlfriend,

1091
00:40:18,060 --> 00:40:19,940
she might be getting married soon.

1092
00:40:20,100 --> 00:40:20,660
Right.

1093
00:40:20,660 --> 00:40:23,140
If she has a good, blessed life,

1094
00:40:23,940 --> 00:40:25,820
why would she bother coming back

1095
00:40:27,140 --> 00:40:28,420
to parents who gave her away?

1096
00:40:29,140 --> 00:40:30,620
A mother full of negative energy,

1097
00:40:30,620 --> 00:40:32,180
a father who blows up at everything,

1098
00:40:32,180 --> 00:40:34,060
a useless twin brother

1099
00:40:34,580 --> 00:40:35,300
who can only

1100
00:40:35,300 --> 00:40:36,380
cry for help,

1101
00:40:36,380 --> 00:40:37,900
and me, the miserable older sister.

1102
00:40:39,100 --> 00:40:40,500
I'm pregnant now.

1103
00:40:40,500 --> 00:40:42,420
Can you not make me upset?

1104
00:40:42,420 --> 00:40:43,540
Zhixia,

1105
00:40:43,540 --> 00:40:45,180
calm down.

1106
00:40:46,220 --> 00:40:46,900
Zhixia.

1107
00:40:50,060 --> 00:40:53,300
Mom, Dad, I'm going with Jianqi
to try on wedding dresses.

1108
00:40:54,100 --> 00:40:56,300
Take some photos
and show your mom later.

1109
00:40:56,300 --> 00:40:57,700
Alright. I'm going, Mom.

1110
00:40:59,540 --> 00:41:00,460
- Take care.
- Well.

1111
00:41:00,460 --> 00:41:01,620
Don't run.

1112
00:41:05,540 --> 00:41:06,620
What's wrong with you?

1113
00:41:06,620 --> 00:41:08,660
You've broken two glasses.

1114
00:41:15,520 --> 00:41:16,500
I'm not knocking it hard.

1115
00:41:19,260 --> 00:41:21,020
Do you know why Ni's mom came?

1116
00:41:21,340 --> 00:41:22,740
Wasn't she here to give us loquats?

1117
00:41:24,020 --> 00:41:25,020
No. She...

1118
00:41:26,380 --> 00:41:28,860
She brought a newspaper.

1119
00:41:30,360 --> 00:41:31,900
There's a missing person notice in it.

1120
00:41:35,180 --> 00:41:36,980
I think they're looking for
our daughter.

1121
00:41:38,580 --> 00:41:39,660
The birthdate

1122
00:41:41,060 --> 00:41:41,740
and the address

1123
00:41:46,140 --> 00:41:47,020
all match.

1124
00:41:48,100 --> 00:41:48,580
Look.

1125
00:41:48,900 --> 00:41:50,460
- How nice.
- The baby is born, right?

1126
00:41:50,460 --> 00:41:51,380
We came to take a look.

1127
00:41:51,380 --> 00:41:52,100
Come on. Let's see.

1128
00:41:52,100 --> 00:41:53,100
Lower your voices.

1129
00:41:53,780 --> 00:41:54,340
Look.

1130
00:41:54,340 --> 00:41:55,020
So adorable.

1131
00:41:55,660 --> 00:41:56,340
Cutie.

1132
00:41:57,620 --> 00:41:58,100
Cutie.

1133
00:41:58,100 --> 00:41:59,580
- Have you given her a name?
- Yes.

1134
00:41:59,620 --> 00:42:00,060
What's it?

1135
00:42:00,380 --> 00:42:00,860
Mingzhu.

1136
00:42:01,300 --> 00:42:02,220
Shen Mingzhu.

1137
00:42:02,860 --> 00:42:04,100
That's nice. A good name.

1138
00:42:04,150 --> 00:42:05,420
A cherished pearl in the palm.

1139
00:42:06,700 --> 00:42:08,260
Mingzhu was born by me,

1140
00:42:08,740 --> 00:42:09,420
right?

1141
00:42:10,220 --> 00:42:10,740
Yes.

1142
00:42:11,420 --> 00:42:13,420
Mingzhu is your birth daughter.

1143
00:42:16,500 --> 00:42:17,740
It's been almost thirty years.

1144
00:42:18,380 --> 00:42:20,180
Not a single word all this time.

1145
00:42:20,180 --> 00:42:20,940
Why now?

1146
00:42:21,860 --> 00:42:23,940
She's about to get married.

1147
00:42:24,380 --> 00:42:25,860
Why would they suddenly look for her?

1148
00:42:27,020 --> 00:42:28,500
If they find her,

1149
00:42:30,980 --> 00:42:31,940
what do we do?

1150
00:42:32,940 --> 00:42:33,740
Mingzhu

1151
00:42:36,340 --> 00:42:37,420
is our daughter.

1152
00:42:39,160 --> 00:42:41,100
No matter who comes for her,
we won't admit it.

1153
00:42:41,860 --> 00:42:42,740
