Have you never tried it before?

No.

7
00:00:14,660 --> 00:00:18,020
Geez, why would you think of him?

8
00:00:18,020 --> 00:00:20,660
Don’t even think about it, Kaew.

9
00:00:20,660 --> 00:00:24,580
Will you please allow me to get to know you more?

10
00:00:25,060 --> 00:00:30,740
Don’t let your feelings grow too far, or else you might regret it later.

11
00:00:30,740 --> 00:00:31,860
Khun Yai !

12
00:00:31,860 --> 00:00:32,820
Khun Yai.

13
00:00:32,820 --> 00:00:34,820
- Khun Yai.
- Shhh!

14
00:00:34,820 --> 00:00:36,820
Did you send him to spy on them?

15
00:00:36,820 --> 00:00:39,700
I must apologise for causing you trouble, Uncle.

16
00:00:39,700 --> 00:00:42,380
I’m willing to do anything for our country.

17
00:00:42,380 --> 00:00:44,580
Sir, Khun Prom is here.

18
00:00:45,260 --> 00:00:46,300
- Kan!
- Yes, sir.

19
00:00:46,300 --> 00:00:49,980
Go stall time for me. Tell him I’ll be there when I’m done with my business.

20
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:56,800
Ruedee.

21
00:00:59,460 --> 00:01:00,460
Wait!

22
00:01:09,960 --> 00:01:11,000
Is someone injured?

23
00:01:11,700 --> 00:01:15,600
Yes, sir. It’s just a fight between servants.

24
00:01:20,060 --> 00:01:21,860
Is it that serious?

25
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:34,800
Prom.

26
00:01:46,930 --> 00:01:49,600
What matter has brought you here?

27
00:01:50,900 --> 00:01:53,100
I see Khun Phra Nai coming to visit this place almost every day,

28
00:01:53,820 --> 00:01:56,700
so I’m curious what it is that he finds interesting here.

29
00:01:57,930 --> 00:02:00,540
I’m merely here to talk about musical instruments with Uncle.

30
00:02:01,160 --> 00:02:04,330
You already know that he is my treble fiddle’s teacher.

31
00:02:07,960 --> 00:02:09,380
I was only joking.

32
00:02:10,020 --> 00:02:14,980
As a matter of fact, Father has asked me to deliver this to you.

33
00:02:15,500 --> 00:02:18,180
These are fruits from our orchard.

34
00:02:20,360 --> 00:02:21,500
How considerate.

35
00:02:22,740 --> 00:02:25,820
Actually, you don’t need to come bearing any gift.

36
00:02:25,820 --> 00:02:30,340
Just a greeting would already make an old man like me happy.

37
00:02:30,900 --> 00:02:32,260
Please don’t say that.

38
00:02:33,060 --> 00:02:37,620
Father said his adopted son often comes here to bother you.

39
00:02:38,400 --> 00:02:40,380
So, he’d like to return the gratitude somehow.

40
00:02:41,560 --> 00:02:43,460
I must be going then.

41
00:02:57,060 --> 00:03:01,500
Do you think your brother honestly wanted to pay me a visit?

42
00:03:02,730 --> 00:03:03,940
Of course not.

43
00:03:04,380 --> 00:03:07,940
Even if it’s Father’s order, a man like Prom…

44
00:03:08,960 --> 00:03:10,660
would never do it if he doesn’t want to.

45
00:03:12,730 --> 00:03:15,800
Then, why do you think he came here?

46
00:03:18,130 --> 00:03:20,780
I’d like to know that too.

62
00:05:40,800 --> 00:05:42,400
Hello, sir. This way, please.

63
00:06:05,960 --> 00:06:07,660
Is there something urgent, sir?

64
00:06:08,330 --> 00:06:10,800
I’ve called for an urgent meeting today…

65
00:06:11,800 --> 00:06:15,500
because we’ve found someone spying on us.

66
00:06:19,260 --> 00:06:24,140
Although we managed to capture him, he somehow escaped.

67
00:06:25,760 --> 00:06:27,780
Do you know who sent him?

68
00:06:28,960 --> 00:06:30,420
We don’t know yet.

69
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:35,900
But I want all of you to look for a man who got shot by an arrow.

70
00:06:37,159 --> 00:06:41,730
I believe he must go see a doctor to have his wound tended somewhere.

71
00:06:43,659 --> 00:06:45,100
An arrow, sir?

72
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:53,960
It seems Chao Meun Sri Sorarak has something to tell us.

73
00:06:59,860 --> 00:07:00,660
Yes.

74
00:07:19,800 --> 00:07:21,220
Father.

75
00:07:22,330 --> 00:07:23,460
You’re back, Yai?

76
00:07:23,760 --> 00:07:28,600
Yes, Father. Uncle said thank you for the gift you’ve asked Prom to deliver to him.

77
00:07:30,500 --> 00:07:36,700
Hm? I don’t remember asking him to visit Luang Sanor though.

78
00:07:42,300 --> 00:07:43,420
Is that so?

79
00:07:43,780 --> 00:07:47,740
Then, he probably prepared that gift himself. I must have misunderstood.

80
00:07:50,130 --> 00:07:54,260
How surprising, I never expected he would know to pay respect to the elder ones.

81
00:07:54,330 --> 00:07:56,700
I guess he’s quite matured now.

82
00:08:08,460 --> 00:08:10,730
Khun Prom is acting very suspicious, Khun Yai.

83
00:08:11,660 --> 00:08:17,500
Saen, send someone to keep an eye on Prom.

84
00:08:18,460 --> 00:08:19,260
Yes, sir.

85
00:08:20,060 --> 00:08:21,140
Wait, Saen.

86
00:08:22,360 --> 00:08:23,530
What is it, sir?

87
00:08:45,700 --> 00:08:47,360
How is it, Dum?

88
00:08:48,260 --> 00:08:50,340
Nothing unusual so far.

89
00:08:53,860 --> 00:08:55,100
Let’s split up and check again.

90
00:08:55,730 --> 00:08:56,820
Sure.

91
00:08:56,930 --> 00:08:57,900
You, come with me.

92
00:08:57,900 --> 00:08:58,540
Yes.

93
00:09:59,180 --> 00:10:00,340
Who sent you?

94
00:10:25,580 --> 00:10:27,380
Go after him!

95
00:10:46,460 --> 00:10:49,660
Kaew, how’s your mother doing?

96
00:10:51,360 --> 00:10:52,620
She’s better now.

97
00:10:54,060 --> 00:10:57,200
Good to hear that. I’m thinking of paying her a visit.

98
00:10:58,660 --> 00:10:59,940
Go ahead.

99
00:11:05,330 --> 00:11:07,020
You didn’t come for many days.

100
00:11:07,580 --> 00:11:11,260
Do you know there was a ruckus here?

101
00:11:11,860 --> 00:11:13,930
What? What happened?

102
00:11:16,100 --> 00:11:21,660
People are talking…that two days ago a thief broke into this place.

103
00:11:22,460 --> 00:11:26,900
Thief? Did they catch him?

104
00:11:28,100 --> 00:11:30,500
No, he got away first.

105
00:11:31,930 --> 00:11:38,700
I don’t know if this has something to do with that injured man Khun Phra Nai has asked us to look after.

106
00:11:38,700 --> 00:11:39,500
Ruedee!

107
00:11:41,160 --> 00:11:43,700
Didn’t Luang Sanor say we shouldn’t tell anyone about it?

108
00:11:45,200 --> 00:11:48,740
But Kan, Kaew isn’t just anyone.

109
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:54,700
To be honest, if Khun Phra Nai hadn’t brought that man here,

110
00:11:54,700 --> 00:11:58,540
Luang Sanor probably wouldn’t have been troubled this much.

111
00:12:03,330 --> 00:12:07,900
Now that you’ve mentioned it, I haven’t seen Khun Phra Nai for many days now.

112
00:12:18,200 --> 00:12:21,300
Kaew, are you back?

113
00:12:23,100 --> 00:12:24,620
Yes, Uncle.

114
00:12:24,620 --> 00:12:26,660
That’s good.

115
00:12:27,060 --> 00:12:28,820
The ceremony day is approaching.

116
00:12:29,330 --> 00:12:31,160
You all must stay focus and practice hard.

117
00:12:32,260 --> 00:12:33,400
Yes, sir.

118
00:12:33,860 --> 00:12:36,780
So, isn’t Khun Phra here yet?

119
00:12:37,130 --> 00:12:38,060
Not yet, sir.

120
00:12:38,560 --> 00:12:45,340
Dum, take the boat and go pick up Khun Phra Vichit.

121
00:12:46,220 --> 00:12:50,580
He’s quite old now. I’m afraid he might fall.

122
00:12:52,100 --> 00:12:53,730
Has the chief called for me urgently?

123
00:12:53,800 --> 00:12:54,500
Yes, sir.

124
00:12:54,860 --> 00:12:55,660
Let’s hurry then.

125
00:12:55,960 --> 00:12:59,500
Prom, are you rushing somewhere?

126
00:13:00,860 --> 00:13:03,580
I don’t think it has anything to do with you, Khun Phra Nai.

127
00:13:05,330 --> 00:13:08,540
On the surface, our country might seem to be at peace right now.

128
00:13:09,060 --> 00:13:14,220
But who knows, there might be a massive wave quietly building up underneath.

129
00:13:16,800 --> 00:13:19,140
I’m worried. That’s why I want to warn you.

130
00:13:20,530 --> 00:13:22,530
Warn me? About what?

131
00:13:24,530 --> 00:13:25,980
About the people you associate with.

132
00:13:27,160 --> 00:13:29,560
Some people are easily deceived by ideology.

133
00:13:30,760 --> 00:13:36,900
So much that they fail to notice some paths might not lead them to glory, but rather a disaster.

134
00:13:38,200 --> 00:13:41,540
Whatever you’ll do, always think of Father and your family.

135
00:13:43,560 --> 00:13:45,200
Don’t be so full of yourself.

136
00:13:46,130 --> 00:13:49,540
I’ve never seen you as a sibling, only just an orphan Father has pity on.

137
00:13:49,900 --> 00:13:51,460
We’re not related!

138
00:13:52,500 --> 00:13:57,700
Don’t you dare act all high and mighty and tell me what to do.

139
00:14:17,800 --> 00:14:22,940
Khun Prom’s henchman is probably that thief
 who broke into Luang Sanor’s house the other day.

140
00:14:22,940 --> 00:14:24,700
I can recognize his frame.

141
00:14:25,380 --> 00:14:30,380
Fortunately, you reacted quickly and had our guy who’s injured moved out of that place first.

142
00:14:31,460 --> 00:14:36,060
Now we can be sure that Prom certainly has something to do with the Anarchist Association.

143
00:15:13,600 --> 00:15:16,000
You want me to get rid of Yai, Chief?

144
00:15:17,900 --> 00:15:25,460
Yes. Didn’t you say so yourself that Khun Phra Nai is the one who sent that rat to spy on us?

145
00:15:25,900 --> 00:15:26,960
Well, yes.

146
00:15:29,060 --> 00:15:35,600
Then, we should nip it in the bud…and destroy it completely.

147
00:15:38,330 --> 00:15:43,180
You’re the one who knows Khun Phra Nai the best. That’s why you’re perfect for this job.

148
00:15:46,500 --> 00:15:50,530
Or are you hesitating because he’s your brother?

149
00:15:52,360 --> 00:15:56,220
No, I’ve never seen that brat as my brother.

150
00:15:56,820 --> 00:15:59,260
I’m only concerned it might be too violent.

151
00:16:00,330 --> 00:16:05,220
Have you forgotten that we’re not doing this for any particular person?

152
00:16:07,330 --> 00:16:10,420
We’re fighting for our nation…for our people!

153
00:16:12,700 --> 00:16:17,580
Only someone with a heart full of courage would be able to make this mission successful.

154
00:16:22,160 --> 00:16:27,360
And I can see that in you, Khun Prom.

155
00:16:30,600 --> 00:16:34,100
Yes, sir. I will not let you down, Chief.

156
00:16:36,060 --> 00:16:39,700
Good. You can go now.

157
00:16:55,730 --> 00:16:58,160
Khun Prom surely respects you a lot, sir.

158
00:16:59,730 --> 00:17:02,220
A boy who grew up being overlooked…

159
00:17:03,800 --> 00:17:06,859
and always placed behind his brother who isn’t even related to him by blood.

160
00:17:08,730 --> 00:17:11,940
All we have to do is make him feel ‘important’.

161
00:17:13,140 --> 00:17:17,579
And he’ll place his life by our feet before he even realizes it.

162
00:17:37,780 --> 00:17:41,860
[Sigh] Is he all right?

163
00:17:50,800 --> 00:17:53,060
Who are you waiting for, Kaew?

164
00:17:55,200 --> 00:17:56,000
Mum.

165
00:17:56,730 --> 00:18:01,930
I’ve seen you sitting here in front of our house for a while now. Who are you waiting for?

166
00:18:02,960 --> 00:18:05,060
Well…it’s Ruedee.

167
00:18:05,800 --> 00:18:09,460
Oh, Ruedee? I’ll go prepare more food then.

168
00:18:10,300 --> 00:18:13,060
No need, Mum.

169
00:18:13,700 --> 00:18:16,220
It’s late. I don’t think she’ll come anymore.

170
00:18:17,660 --> 00:18:19,730
Then, come along and eat something.

171
00:18:21,300 --> 00:18:22,340
Yes, Mum.

172
00:18:51,500 --> 00:18:53,730
What are you hoping for?

173
00:18:55,700 --> 00:18:58,200
Aren’t you happy that he’s not coming anymore?

174
00:19:01,160 --> 00:19:06,220
But why do I feel so…? [Sigh]

175
00:19:13,760 --> 00:19:16,540
I want you to be careful though.

176
00:19:17,100 --> 00:19:25,340
Don’t let your feelings grow too far, or else you might regret it later.

177
00:19:46,800 --> 00:19:51,540
Although I don’t get to see your face, just a glimpse of your roof can make me happy.

178
00:19:54,400 --> 00:19:55,730
Mock me all you like.

179
00:19:56,700 --> 00:19:59,700
I know you often go stealing glimpses of Ruedee’s roof too.

180
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:09,420
Let’s go. I must get to see Kaewta tomorrow.

181
00:20:36,800 --> 00:20:38,100
Khun Phra Nai.

182
00:20:38,930 --> 00:20:40,260
I’ve been waiting for you.

183
00:20:41,700 --> 00:20:44,100
Is there something you want to talk to me?

184
00:20:45,360 --> 00:20:47,530
Aren’t you on your way to Luang Sanor’s place?

185
00:20:48,460 --> 00:20:49,900
I just want to accompany you.

186
00:20:50,900 --> 00:20:56,500
Please don’t. I walk there every day. I can go alone.

187
00:20:58,860 --> 00:20:59,660
Wait!

188
00:21:01,730 --> 00:21:03,900
I still haven’t got to talk to you about many things.

189
00:21:06,500 --> 00:21:10,200
But I don’t have anything to talk to Chao Meun Samur Jairatch.

190
00:21:11,930 --> 00:21:16,100
Why did you call me like that? Like I’m a stranger to you.

191
00:21:21,160 --> 00:21:25,930
I thought you already understood everything I had told you earlier.

192
00:21:30,160 --> 00:21:31,900
Understood what?

193
00:21:34,160 --> 00:21:38,060
Can’t you see? That I’m not a lady.

194
00:21:40,100 --> 00:21:42,460
Why would you keep pestering me?

195
00:21:44,500 --> 00:21:46,100
Is it because you hate me?

196
00:21:48,100 --> 00:21:50,160
It’s because we’re both men.

197
00:21:54,460 --> 00:21:58,820
Even though we’re both men, it’s still love.

198
00:22:02,200 --> 00:22:03,700
I love you, Kaew.

199
00:22:08,260 --> 00:22:10,500
How can you say it so easily like that?

200
00:22:10,500 --> 00:22:11,980
Why make it difficult?

201
00:22:16,820 --> 00:22:17,660
Kaew!

202
00:22:25,200 --> 00:22:26,000
Khun Yai!

203
00:22:29,860 --> 00:22:30,660
Khun Yai!

204
00:22:38,660 --> 00:22:40,620
Run, Kaew!

205
00:22:41,500 --> 00:22:42,420
Khun Yai…

206
00:22:47,460 --> 00:22:48,740
Khun Yai!

207
00:22:50,100 --> 00:22:51,220
Khun Yai!

208
00:22:53,600 --> 00:22:54,740
Kaew!

209
00:22:55,180 --> 00:22:55,860
Kaew!

210
00:22:56,460 --> 00:22:57,260
Kaew!

211
00:22:57,330 --> 00:22:58,380
Kaew!

212
00:22:58,380 --> 00:23:00,020
- Kaew!
- What happened, Kaew?

213
00:23:00,130 --> 00:23:00,930
Kaew!

214
00:23:00,960 --> 00:23:01,940
Kaew!

215
00:23:01,940 --> 00:23:03,580
Kaew! Kaew!

216
00:23:03,580 --> 00:23:05,940
Kaew, are you all right?

217
00:23:13,560 --> 00:23:15,060
I’m fine.

218
00:23:16,900 --> 00:23:18,260
But Khun Yai…

219
00:23:28,700 --> 00:23:30,530
Kaew! What are you doing?

220
00:23:32,200 --> 00:23:34,330
Khun Yai got hurt because he saved me.

221
00:23:35,130 --> 00:23:36,940
I want to know if he’s all right.

222
00:23:38,360 --> 00:23:44,540
You can’t, Kaew. Luangta Cham only allows you to recall your past life for only an hour.

223
00:23:45,060 --> 00:23:46,380
Don’t you remember?

224
00:23:49,600 --> 00:23:52,300
But what if Khun Yai dies because he has saved me?

225
00:23:53,730 --> 00:23:55,060
I have to find out.

226
00:24:00,560 --> 00:24:01,620
Chai…

227
00:24:03,930 --> 00:24:04,730
Kaew…

228
00:24:06,860 --> 00:24:07,660
Don’t, Kaew!

229
00:24:08,930 --> 00:24:13,700
Kaew, Ruedee and I have already promised Aunt Chan…

230
00:24:14,760 --> 00:24:17,600
that we’ll never let you do anything that might harm yourself.

231
00:24:19,460 --> 00:24:21,260
He’s right, Kaew.

232
00:24:21,260 --> 00:24:28,300
Luangta Cham also said that if you don’t strictly follow his order, something bad might happen to you.

233
00:24:33,300 --> 00:24:38,580
But I just want to make sure that Khun Yai is safe.

234
00:24:40,460 --> 00:24:42,020
Can’t you just let me do that?

235
00:24:51,330 --> 00:24:52,130
Ruedee!

236
00:24:56,500 --> 00:24:58,530
That’s the sound of Khun Yai playing treble fiddle. Can you hear it?

237
00:25:01,460 --> 00:25:02,260
Khun Yai!

238
00:25:02,330 --> 00:25:03,220
Kaew!

239
00:25:03,220 --> 00:25:04,500
Kaew!

240
00:25:04,660 --> 00:25:05,460
Khun Yai!

241
00:25:05,600 --> 00:25:09,220
Khun Yai! Are you around here?

242
00:25:09,220 --> 00:25:11,500
Kaew!

243
00:25:12,460 --> 00:25:13,300
What is it?

244
00:25:15,100 --> 00:25:18,660
Can’t you hear it, Ruedee? It’s Khun Yai playing treble fiddle.

245
00:25:21,160 --> 00:25:23,260
I can’t hear anything.

246
00:25:29,600 --> 00:25:31,600
Have I imagined it?

247
00:25:33,660 --> 00:25:39,460
You might not. But Khun Yai might want to warn you not too overdo it.

248
00:25:44,100 --> 00:25:45,600
There’s still tomorrow, Kaew.

249
00:25:47,260 --> 00:25:48,700
You’re exhausted now.

250
00:25:49,700 --> 00:25:51,860
Maybe you should go and get some rest.

251
00:25:52,160 --> 00:25:53,960
Your mum is probably worried about you now.

252
00:26:01,600 --> 00:26:03,820
Please get some rest, my dear.

253
00:26:13,700 --> 00:26:14,900
Come on, let’s go, Kaew.

254
00:27:01,760 --> 00:27:06,260
Kaew, are you still up, dear?

255
00:27:07,300 --> 00:27:10,100
I’ll go to bed soon.

256
00:27:11,200 --> 00:27:14,940
Come, I’ll put you to bed. Don’t worry about it too much.

257
00:27:14,940 --> 00:27:17,540
Let’s sort it out tomorrow, okay?

258
00:27:18,300 --> 00:27:18,700
Yes.

259
00:27:18,700 --> 00:27:20,140
Good boy.

260
00:27:22,700 --> 00:27:24,000
Get some sleep, dear.

261
00:27:25,700 --> 00:27:27,540
You should get some sleep too.

262
00:27:27,900 --> 00:27:29,820
Yes, good night.

263
00:28:17,580 --> 00:28:20,360
Saen, how are you?

264
00:28:23,730 --> 00:28:25,200
I’m much better now.

265
00:28:27,400 --> 00:28:34,740
Khun Yai, what will happen if Khun Kaew meditates and can recall his past life?

266
00:28:39,260 --> 00:28:41,360
He should be able to remember everything soon.

267
00:28:52,700 --> 00:28:54,020
Who’s there?

268
00:28:57,760 --> 00:28:58,560
Kaew.

269
00:29:04,530 --> 00:29:08,340
Khun Yai! Are you in here?

270
00:29:09,960 --> 00:29:11,500
I’m worried about you.

271
00:29:13,460 --> 00:29:14,930
Are you safe?

272
00:29:33,700 --> 00:29:35,000
Why did you come back?

273
00:29:41,130 --> 00:29:41,930
Khun Yai.

274
00:29:43,260 --> 00:29:46,380
I’m right in front of you. Can’t you see me now?

275
00:30:03,000 --> 00:30:08,580
Please stop, Kaewta. If you keep doing this,

276
00:30:11,260 --> 00:30:12,860
you’ll be in danger.

277
00:30:56,300 --> 00:31:03,530
Khun Yai!

278
00:31:24,160 --> 00:31:28,500
Stop it! Don’t disappoint Father any further!

279
00:31:45,300 --> 00:31:47,500
Khun Kaew! Get Khun Yai and run away!

280
00:31:49,860 --> 00:31:51,130
Let’s go, Khun Yai.

281
00:32:01,660 --> 00:32:02,620
Go after him!

282
00:32:03,580 --> 00:32:04,500
Khun Prom!

283
00:32:07,980 --> 00:32:09,420
Don’t even think.

284
00:32:29,100 --> 00:32:30,220
Where did he go?

285
00:32:59,460 --> 00:33:00,300
Khun Yai.

286
00:33:01,700 --> 00:33:02,900
I’ll be fine.

287
00:33:04,540 --> 00:33:07,700
I’ll take you back to your place.

288
00:33:07,700 --> 00:33:09,580
No, you can’t.

289
00:33:09,900 --> 00:33:14,740
If people know that I got ambushed, it will ruin the big plan.

290
00:33:16,200 --> 00:33:19,700
Then, what do you want me to do?

291
00:33:29,130 --> 00:33:30,620
I guess we have to go there.

292
00:33:31,160 --> 00:33:32,300
Go where?

293
00:33:38,460 --> 00:33:42,420
Please be careful. Let’s sit down first.

294
00:33:49,130 --> 00:33:50,260
Are you all right?

295
00:33:52,500 --> 00:33:53,940
I’m fine.

296
00:33:56,360 --> 00:33:57,860
Let me see the wound.

297
00:34:28,659 --> 00:34:30,500
You’re lucky it’s not that deep.

298
00:34:31,860 --> 00:34:36,730
You’ll find some medicine in that chest.

299
00:34:40,300 --> 00:34:44,219
Saen and I built this cottage to use during a secret operation.

300
00:34:44,699 --> 00:34:47,620
We store some medicine and basic supplies in case of emergency.

301
00:34:59,760 --> 00:35:01,400
Is it this one?

302
00:35:09,100 --> 00:35:12,700
Please forgive me for dragging you into this mess.

303
00:35:14,530 --> 00:35:16,340
Who are they?

304
00:35:17,700 --> 00:35:20,020
Probably those who get angry…

305
00:35:21,300 --> 00:35:24,220
because I’ve tried to expose the evil things they are doing.

306
00:35:30,500 --> 00:35:34,300
Thank you for staying by my side.

307
00:35:38,560 --> 00:35:39,360
Yes.

308
00:35:51,060 --> 00:35:52,400
Please stay still.

309
00:35:59,200 --> 00:36:02,600
Your hands are freezing. Are you sure you’re all right?

310
00:36:04,660 --> 00:36:06,560
I’m fine indeed.

311
00:36:22,860 --> 00:36:26,900
Maybe, we should change our clothes a bit.

312
00:37:12,560 --> 00:37:14,900
No fever, that’s good.

313
00:37:53,400 --> 00:37:55,260
You look at me as if I were something strange.

314
00:38:01,160 --> 00:38:02,600
I’m sorry.

315
00:38:14,360 --> 00:38:15,860
I need to ask you something.

316
00:38:19,330 --> 00:38:20,860
What is it?

317
00:38:29,500 --> 00:38:36,180
I almost got killed this time. The pain from that blade…

318
00:38:38,160 --> 00:38:45,500
has reminded me…how life is so short.

319
00:38:47,760 --> 00:38:49,980
Too short to keep all these feelings inside.

320
00:38:55,160 --> 00:38:57,700
I’m afraid I won’t have a chance to tell you later.

321
00:39:04,000 --> 00:39:04,800
Yes.

322
00:39:15,760 --> 00:39:17,500
I love you, Kaewta.

323
00:39:29,060 --> 00:39:29,860
Love?

324
00:39:33,660 --> 00:39:36,060
Even though I’m not a lady?

325
00:39:40,460 --> 00:39:43,000
The world has set up so many rules to define what love should be like.

326
00:39:46,660 --> 00:39:48,000
But there are no rules in my heart.

327
00:39:50,900 --> 00:39:52,260
It has no conditions.

328
00:39:56,360 --> 00:39:57,900
Except that it must be you.

329
00:40:04,500 --> 00:40:11,140
I still insist…that love is love.

330
00:41:29,600 --> 00:41:30,400
Khun Yai!

331
00:42:42,220 --> 00:42:45,780
I’ll…I’ll prepare the bed for you.

332
00:42:47,180 --> 00:42:51,220
You can sleep inside. I’ll sleep out here.

333
00:43:20,700 --> 00:43:22,180
Still not back, Miss.

334
00:43:22,930 --> 00:43:26,730
What? Brother and Saen haven’t come home since last night?

335
00:43:27,100 --> 00:43:28,220
That’s right, Miss.

336
00:43:28,220 --> 00:43:31,540
I heard Nanny Yam tell your father that, Miss.

337
00:43:31,560 --> 00:43:33,460
Nanny Yam, tell Tiang to get the car ready.

338
00:43:33,700 --> 00:43:34,500
Yes, My Lord.

339
00:43:34,960 --> 00:43:36,660
Tiang, get the car now!

340
00:43:36,760 --> 00:43:37,560
Father.

341
00:43:37,960 --> 00:43:40,500
I know. I’m taking our men to look for them.

342
00:43:42,700 --> 00:43:45,000
Why don’t you try Luang Sanor’s place, Father?

343
00:43:48,300 --> 00:43:52,060
Khun Phra Nai often goes there lately. I wonder what he finds so interesting there.

344
00:43:52,900 --> 00:43:55,020
Perhaps, the dancer maybe.

345
00:43:56,200 --> 00:43:57,500
At Luang Sanor’s place?

346
00:43:59,500 --> 00:44:01,500
Father! I’ll go with you.

347
00:44:02,300 --> 00:44:03,100
Let’s go.

348
00:44:05,900 --> 00:44:06,500
Stay here!

349
00:44:06,500 --> 00:44:07,600
Yes, Miss.

350
00:44:15,800 --> 00:44:17,420
Just get on with your work, Som.

351
00:44:17,620 --> 00:44:18,060
Go!

352
00:44:18,060 --> 00:44:19,380
Yes, Master!

353
00:44:27,220 --> 00:44:30,500
But Khun Prom, our man has just informed that…

354
00:44:30,660 --> 00:44:33,100
Khun Yai isn’t at Luang Sanor’s place.

355
00:44:34,300 --> 00:44:35,530
That’s why.

356
00:44:36,700 --> 00:44:39,560
That’s why I must divert Father’s and Sophee’s attention to that place.

357
00:44:40,700 --> 00:44:41,500
Boon.

358
00:44:41,900 --> 00:44:42,700
Yes, sir.

359
00:44:44,530 --> 00:44:48,420
Go tell our men to keep watch on every route back to this house.

360
00:44:49,200 --> 00:44:54,220
If anyone sees that brat, just kill him and come get the prize from me.

361
00:44:54,220 --> 00:44:55,180
Yes, sir.

362
00:45:36,800 --> 00:45:38,940
What the heck was I thinking?

363
00:46:01,700 --> 00:46:02,500
Kaew.

364
00:46:39,660 --> 00:46:40,700
There you are.

365
00:46:43,560 --> 00:46:44,500
Khun Yai.

366
00:46:45,100 --> 00:46:46,940
I want to have a bath too.

367
00:47:07,900 --> 00:47:09,060
Is it hurt?

368
00:47:12,960 --> 00:47:16,000
Getting hurt this time…isn’t so bad after all.

369
00:47:18,860 --> 00:47:22,960
Your wound is fatal. How could you say it wasn’t that bad?

370
00:47:26,000 --> 00:47:28,580
At least, it makes me know…

371
00:47:28,580 --> 00:47:30,980
how much you care about me.

372
00:47:32,260 --> 00:47:38,140
If I get to see you like this every morning when I wake up, it’d surely be nice.

373
00:47:45,560 --> 00:47:47,360
That’s impossible.

374
00:47:58,100 --> 00:48:06,260
As long as we love each other like this, I’m sure we’ll be able to find a way.

375
00:48:12,180 --> 00:48:13,500
Have you…

376
00:48:16,140 --> 00:48:18,020
forgotten about last night?

377
00:48:24,800 --> 00:48:27,060
You won’t get hurt if you don’t try it in the first place.

378
00:48:28,740 --> 00:48:31,460
I think we should stop here.

379
00:48:35,100 --> 00:48:38,180
But Kaew…what about last night?

380
00:48:38,360 --> 00:48:39,800
Hurry up and finish washing, Khun Yai.

381
00:48:40,330 --> 00:48:43,900
I’ll make something for you to eat, then we can go back home.

382
00:48:45,560 --> 00:48:46,360
Kaew!

383
00:49:14,860 --> 00:49:16,000
Khun Yai!

384
00:49:17,000 --> 00:49:17,860
Khun Yai!

385
00:49:21,660 --> 00:49:22,460
Saen.

386
00:49:23,200 --> 00:49:24,200
Khun Yai!

387
00:49:26,700 --> 00:49:27,930
- Saen.
- Saen.

388
00:49:28,730 --> 00:49:30,800
I knew you two must be here.

389
00:49:31,560 --> 00:49:32,700
How are you?

390
00:49:33,200 --> 00:49:34,100
Are you hurt?

391
00:49:35,160 --> 00:49:37,600
Those minions can’t hurt me, sir.

392
00:49:38,960 --> 00:49:39,900
I got it, you’re great.

393
00:49:41,660 --> 00:49:43,180
Anyway, sir.

394
00:49:43,180 --> 00:49:45,580
You and Khun Kaew should hurry home now.

395
00:49:45,580 --> 00:49:48,220
Everyone is worrying sick looking for you.

396
00:49:55,460 --> 00:49:59,780
We’ve searched every dancer’s house but still couldn’t find Kaew.

397
00:50:00,180 --> 00:50:06,980
Oh, dear. He’s also not at Luang Sanor’s. We have no idea if he’s dead or alive.

398
00:50:12,400 --> 00:50:13,200
Mum!

399
00:50:13,330 --> 00:50:14,060
Mum!

400
00:50:14,060 --> 00:50:14,800
Kaew!

401
00:50:14,800 --> 00:50:15,600
Kaew!

402
00:50:16,700 --> 00:50:17,500
Kaew!

403
00:50:18,360 --> 00:50:20,420
My dear, are you all right?

404
00:50:20,420 --> 00:50:21,620
Are you hurt anywhere?

405
00:50:22,620 --> 00:50:23,360
I’m fine, Mum.

406
00:50:23,380 --> 00:50:25,020
Where have you been?

407
00:50:25,500 --> 00:50:27,700
We’ve been looking for you since yesterday.

408
00:50:30,060 --> 00:50:30,860
Khun Phra Nai.

409
00:50:33,300 --> 00:50:35,220
Oh my goodness.

410
00:50:35,760 --> 00:50:37,100
Kan, stop!
- Kan.

411
00:50:38,300 --> 00:50:40,220
Khun Phra Nai is the one who saved me.

412
00:50:42,530 --> 00:50:43,760
What happened, dear?

413
00:50:45,000 --> 00:50:47,820
Well…

414
00:50:49,300 --> 00:50:53,580
I ran into him on his way to Luang Sanor’s place. But then, we got ambushed by the bandits.

415
00:50:54,160 --> 00:50:55,260
Good grief!

416
00:50:59,700 --> 00:51:03,220
Khun Phra Nai got hurt from saving me.

417
00:51:04,340 --> 00:51:06,540
We ran away and decided to hide for a while, Mum.

418
00:51:06,560 --> 00:51:07,660
Who are those bandits?

419
00:51:08,460 --> 00:51:10,700
Why did they want to rob you, Kaew?

420
00:51:10,700 --> 00:51:15,820
I think you’re actually not their target.

421
00:51:18,800 --> 00:51:20,900
All right there.

422
00:51:23,180 --> 00:51:28,620
I can’t thank you enough, Khun Phra Nai, for saving Kaew.

423
00:51:30,330 --> 00:51:32,700
Don’t worry, it’s what I should do anyway.

424
00:51:36,580 --> 00:51:39,420
Oh, he means…

425
00:51:39,420 --> 00:51:43,100
It’s also the royal guard’s duty to oversee the safety and well-being of the King’s people.

426
00:51:44,500 --> 00:51:47,000
If there’s nothing now, we’d be taking our leave then.

427
00:51:48,460 --> 00:51:49,660
Let’s go, sir.

428
00:51:50,420 --> 00:51:52,700
Well…I… Saen!

429
00:51:53,140 --> 00:51:54,340
Let’s go, sir.

430
00:51:59,600 --> 00:52:01,740
Are you all right, Kaew?

431
00:52:02,260 --> 00:52:05,860
My poor baby. Are you hurt anywhere?

432
00:52:06,660 --> 00:52:07,730
I’m fine now, Mum.

433
00:52:12,420 --> 00:52:14,180
You’re safe now, dear.

434
00:52:15,930 --> 00:52:17,620
That was close, Khun Yai!

435
00:52:18,100 --> 00:52:19,730
I don’t see why I have to hide it.

436
00:52:20,200 --> 00:52:23,220
I actually want Miss Payom to know how I feel about Kaew.

437
00:52:24,140 --> 00:52:25,220
What?

438
00:52:26,330 --> 00:52:28,200
Has Khun Kaew accepted your feelings, sir?

439
00:52:30,060 --> 00:52:32,700
He also feels the same as I do, I’m sure about that.

440
00:52:33,460 --> 00:52:35,500
I’ll do everything to win him over.

441
00:52:37,400 --> 00:52:38,330
Suit yourself then.

442
00:52:38,900 --> 00:52:40,660
But right now, we should hurry home.

443
00:52:40,860 --> 00:52:42,700
I’m afraid it’s total chaos there.

444
00:52:44,700 --> 00:52:46,100
Wait, Saen.

445
00:52:47,330 --> 00:52:48,200
What?

446
00:52:49,760 --> 00:52:54,300
On our way back, Prom must’ve definitely sent someone to ambush on us.

447
00:52:55,930 --> 00:52:57,460
We should take the secret route.

448
00:52:58,960 --> 00:52:59,760
Yes, sir.

449
00:53:13,140 --> 00:53:16,130
There they are!

450
00:53:17,100 --> 00:53:17,930
My Lord.

451
00:53:20,200 --> 00:53:21,760
My dear miss.

452
00:53:22,930 --> 00:53:24,560
Have you found them, Father?

453
00:53:26,260 --> 00:53:29,930
Brother didn’t go there. And Uncle also has no idea where he is.

454
00:53:31,060 --> 00:53:34,340
Poor Khun Yai. Poor Saen.

455
00:53:34,340 --> 00:53:38,540
Where are they now? Please let them be all right.

456
00:53:47,600 --> 00:53:50,260
Khun Yai and I won’t die so easily, Nanny Yam.

457
00:53:54,860 --> 00:53:56,180
Father.

458
00:53:59,660 --> 00:54:00,940
Brother!

459
00:54:05,660 --> 00:54:07,400
Where have you been, Brother?

460
00:54:08,500 --> 00:54:12,620
Where did you get all these clothes from?

461
00:54:15,060 --> 00:54:19,260
Where have you been, Yai? Why are you back just now?

462
00:54:33,540 --> 00:54:35,660
[NEXT EPISODE]
People at the market are talking, Miss.

463
00:54:35,660 --> 00:54:39,140
That Khun Phra Nai is now infatuated with a dancer from Luang Sanor’s place.

464
00:54:39,140 --> 00:54:44,340
Lady Sophee is here to select dancers to perform…

465
00:54:44,340 --> 00:54:47,140
at the Queen Mother’s banquet.

466
00:54:47,860 --> 00:54:49,700
I’ll have this one.

467
00:54:50,780 --> 00:54:52,740
Thank you, Miss.

468
00:54:52,740 --> 00:54:54,260
What happened, Ruedee?

469
00:54:54,260 --> 00:54:55,660
Is that blood?

470
00:54:56,380 --> 00:54:59,460
What did you say? They’re planning to assassinate His Majesty?

471
00:54:59,460 --> 00:55:01,540
No one else knows about this.

472
00:55:01,900 --> 00:55:06,060
Please keep it between us only, Father.

473
00:55:06,060 --> 00:55:09,620
That brat already knew about us. We can’t stick to our old plan now.

474
00:55:09,620 --> 00:55:13,540
If he’s dead, his people will have a reason to attack us.

475
00:55:23,940 --> 00:55:25,300
We’re together all day today

476
00:55:25,340 --> 00:55:25,740
That’s right.

477
00:55:25,740 --> 00:55:27,540
-We’re filming together today.
- Yes.

478
00:55:27,540 --> 00:55:28,860
That’s because we’ll be investigating a case.

479
00:55:28,860 --> 00:55:33,620
Khun Phra Nai and Luang Sanor are…secret agents.

480
00:55:33,620 --> 00:55:39,220
Like that scene earlier, we sent someone on a secret mission but he got attacked.

481
00:55:39,220 --> 00:55:41,900
- Yeah, he’s injured. A spy, right?
- Yes, a spy.

482
00:55:41,900 --> 00:55:44,820
- I sent him to spy on the association, but he got caught.
 - A spy.

483
00:55:44,820 --> 00:55:48,820
But suddenly, Prom shows up. Something is fishy here.

484
00:55:49,140 --> 00:55:50,660
So, please wait and see.

485
00:55:51,060 --> 00:55:52,060
Let them set up the cameras first.

486
00:55:52,340 --> 00:55:55,100
They are all over there, at the pavilion. Wanna go there?

487
00:55:55,700 --> 00:55:57,260
Let’s go. It’s quite cool in there.

488
00:56:02,660 --> 00:56:04,340
Here they are. Say something.

489
00:56:04,540 --> 00:56:05,340
Hi there.

490
00:56:05,940 --> 00:56:07,780
- What are you guys doing?
- Hello, Saen.

491
00:56:08,140 --> 00:56:09,500
We’re waiting.

492
00:56:09,940 --> 00:56:13,900
What were you talking about earlier? Did you mention something about Prom? What was that?

493
00:56:13,900 --> 00:56:15,740
- Prom? He is….
 - What did he do?

494
00:56:16,060 --> 00:56:18,620
It’s our spy. He got attacked.

495
00:56:18,780 --> 00:56:24,180
Then Prom appears out of nowhere. But he doesn’t usually do this kind of thing,

496
00:56:24,180 --> 00:56:25,660
visiting and giving gifts to the elders.

497
00:56:25,660 --> 00:56:31,940
- Oh! That’s fishy.
 Yeah, very fishy…And then Chao Mu..Chao Mi…

498
00:56:32,180 --> 00:56:35,660
That’s it. Now, we’ll shoot from another angle.

499
00:56:35,660 --> 00:56:38,660
They’re moving the cameras outside to shoot back inside.

500
00:56:38,700 --> 00:56:41,260
And then this scene will be done.

501
00:56:41,940 --> 00:56:45,700
We had to stand quite close to each other because there was…

502
00:56:45,700 --> 00:56:48,380
- very little space.
 Our noses almost touched. So close.

503
00:56:48,380 --> 00:56:51,580
Sounds romantic but you guys were actually biting each other’s head off.

504
00:56:53,100 --> 00:56:55,340
I see Khun Phra Nai coming to visit this place almost every day.

505
00:56:56,380 --> 00:56:57,700
So, I’m quite curious.

506
00:56:57,700 --> 00:57:02,820
Father said his adopted son often comes here to bother you.

507
00:57:03,700 --> 00:57:07,740
So, he’d like to return the gratitude somehow.

508
00:57:13,540 --> 00:57:15,180
You’re back?

509
00:57:16,140 --> 00:57:17,540
Yes, Uncle.

510
00:57:18,380 --> 00:57:19,700
Very well then.

511
00:57:21,540 --> 00:57:22,460
Kaew.

512
00:57:22,460 --> 00:57:23,620
Oh! Kaew.

513
00:57:33,660 --> 00:57:34,580
Prom.

514
00:57:39,060 --> 00:57:40,940
How could you say it so easily?

515
00:57:41,940 --> 00:57:43,340
Why make it difficult?

516
00:57:46,540 --> 00:57:47,500
Kaew!

517
00:57:52,540 --> 00:57:53,860
Action!

518
00:58:02,220 --> 00:58:03,820
Khun Yai! Khun Yai…

519
00:58:05,940 --> 00:58:09,180
Finally, some action scenes for me.

520
00:58:09,700 --> 00:58:10,740
Waiting.

521
00:58:30,300 --> 00:58:34,540
Please stop. Don’t disappoint Father any further.

522
00:58:37,260 --> 00:58:39,060
You’re lucky it’s not that deep.

523
00:58:40,340 --> 00:58:42,180
But the bleeding hasn’t stopped yet.

524
00:58:45,140 --> 00:58:45,940
He’s injured.

525
00:58:46,140 --> 00:58:49,140
Ouch, that hurts.

526
00:58:49,300 --> 00:58:51,180
- So fake.
 Kaew, it hurts.

527
00:58:52,340 --> 00:58:55,740
If it were me, I’d pinch the wound until it’s torn.

528
00:58:56,260 --> 00:58:57,660
Ouch. Now, the other side hurts.

529
00:58:59,460 --> 00:59:01,260
- The other side?
 - Yes, the other side.

530
00:59:01,260 --> 00:59:05,140
Geez, Kaew! Do you also carry anaesthetic?

531
00:59:07,060 --> 00:59:09,100
Eat that.
 - Eat that, yeah.

532
00:59:09,860 --> 00:59:11,060
He’s so cagey.

533
00:59:11,060 --> 00:59:15,380
We’re running away from the bandits.

534
00:59:15,380 --> 00:59:17,780
Yeah. You must be aching then.

535
00:59:18,420 --> 00:59:20,740
What a hit.

536
00:59:20,740 --> 00:59:22,940
Mosquitoes and insects seem to stay clear from me.

537
00:59:22,940 --> 00:59:24,740
All because of his killer hands.

538
00:59:25,260 --> 00:59:28,340
Always fooling around. So, we ran away…to hide here.

539
00:59:29,060 --> 00:59:30,380
But I want to do more than that.

540
00:59:32,140 --> 00:59:34,140
Seriously, Kaewta is too naive.

541
00:59:34,700 --> 00:59:39,860
I lure you here, to the secret hideout that only me and Saen…

542
00:59:41,060 --> 00:59:42,220
- Oh.
 - …know about it.

543
00:59:43,180 --> 00:59:46,180
