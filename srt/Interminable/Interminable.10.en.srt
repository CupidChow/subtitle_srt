Thank you very much for helping me write the letter.

81

So, have you told Ruedee that the letter is from you?

82
00:08:42,059 --> 00:08:44,059
Oh, I didn't tell him.

83
00:08:44,059 --> 00:08:47,190
Ah, so how did he know that you wrote it?

84
00:08:47,580 --> 00:08:50,700
I said I would sign for you, but you still didn't want to.

85
00:08:50,700 --> 00:08:54,020
I can't read, I didn't write it,

86
00:08:54,020 --> 00:08:56,750
so don't dare ask you to sign.

But I'm sure

00:09:03,340 --> 00:09:05,980
Ruedee must know that I wrote it.

91
00:09:08,900 --> 00:09:09,660

92
00:09:13,260 --> 00:09:14,100

What nonsense is this, right?

100
00:09:49,980 --> 00:09:54,100
I'm a man. How could I like Mr Phra Nai?

101
00:09:54,500 --> 00:09:55,580
Correct.

102
00:09:56,700 --> 00:09:58,540
I'm also very confused,

103
00:09:59,460 --> 00:10:04,300
why do you dare to love someone whose status is higher than you?

104
00:10:10,100 --> 00:10:11,740
If you don't believe it,

105
00:10:13,500 --> 00:10:15,760
I can't say anything either.

106
00:10:17,660 --> 00:10:21,180
Don't lie to me. We've been together since childhood.

107
00:10:22,140 --> 00:10:23,800
Just by looking into your eyes,

108
00:10:23,980 --> 00:10:26,780
I already know what you're thinking.

109
00:10:27,380 --> 00:10:29,900
Just think whatever you like, Kan.

110
00:10:32,060 --> 00:10:34,260
But I only ask one thing from you.

111
00:10:37,380 --> 00:10:40,260
Don't say anything that damages Mr. Phra Nai's good reputation.

112
00:10:40,260 --> 00:10:42,520
So, have you ever thought about it?

113
00:10:42,620 --> 00:10:45,220
Your love with Tuan Phra Nai

114
00:10:45,900 --> 00:10:47,960
forever will never come true.

115
00:10:48,620 --> 00:10:50,820
Not just because you're a man,

116
00:10:51,420 --> 00:10:54,540
but also because you don't deserve to be with him.

117
00:10:54,540 --> 00:10:58,580
People of such noble status only think of you as a toy.

118
00:10:59,500 --> 00:11:04,540
In the end, he would marry a lady who was his equal.

119
00:11:06,460 --> 00:11:08,590
I'm reminding you for your own good.

120
00:11:09,300 --> 00:11:11,980
Now forget that intention, Kaew.

121
00:11:22,300 --> 00:11:23,220
Kaew.

122
00:11:53,660 --> 00:11:56,860

You and Kan just go home first, Ruedee.

124
00:12:00,740 --> 00:12:03,270
I also want to buy medicine for my mother.

125
00:12:03,940 --> 00:12:07,900
I also have to seek Dam's help. You go home first, Ruedee.

126

Good.

127
00:12:18,060 --> 00:12:18,820

128
00:12:20,820 --> 00:12:23,700
It seems that it must be resolved firmly.

129
00:12:24,420 --> 00:12:25,540
Good.

130
00:12:44,820 --> 00:12:47,740

00:13:16,900 --> 00:13:17,740
Uh.

00:13:18,980 --> 00:13:20,540
It's nothing.

139
00:13:22,980 --> 00:13:25,710

141
00:13:30,260 --> 00:13:31,580
Ouch, Mr. Yai.

142
00:13:33,300 --> 00:13:34,780
Don't be like this.

143

144
00:13:37,100 --> 00:13:37,940
by Mom?

145
00:13:39,140 --> 00:13:40,500
I've seen it.

146
00:13:41,140 --> 00:13:42,540
There's no one inside.

147
00:13:43,420 --> 00:13:44,300
Oh.

148
00:13:45,100 --> 00:13:49,820
Or are you angry with me because I haven't seen your practice these past few days?

149
00:13:51,380 --> 00:13:54,020
- Because I have something important to do... - No.

150
00:13:56,580 --> 00:13:58,860
It's okay, Tuan Yai.

151
00:14:01,140 --> 00:14:02,020
Kaew.

152
00:14:02,780 --> 00:14:04,220
Don't lie to me.

153
00:14:05,140 --> 00:14:07,670
Let me know what problems you have in mind.

154
00:14:09,260 --> 00:14:12,190
Let me also help shoulder your worries.

155
00:14:16,100 --> 00:14:17,380

156
00:14:18,860 --> 00:14:22,060
I can only use this method to get you to talk.

157
00:14:44,660 --> 00:14:45,660
Kaew!

158
00:14:49,140 --> 00:14:50,060
Mother.

159
00:15:27,140 --> 00:15:28,020
Mother.

160
00:15:28,700 --> 00:15:29,620

161
00:15:31,620 --> 00:15:32,340

162
00:15:32,660 --> 00:15:33,660
Mother.

163
00:15:35,740 --> 00:15:37,860
Kaew, let me explain to Auntie.

164
00:15:37,860 --> 00:15:39,660
Mr Phra Nai, you go home first.

165
00:15:39,900 --> 00:15:41,780
I'll talk to Mom myself.

166
00:15:41,780 --> 00:15:43,500
But Kaew... Let me...

167
00:15:45,380 --> 00:15:48,940
You go home first, sir. Let's just say I'm begging you.

168
00:15:57,260 --> 00:15:58,500
Mother.

169
00:16:56,460 --> 00:16:57,420
Mother.

170
00:16:59,060 --> 00:17:00,580
Eat a little.

171
00:17:02,460 --> 00:17:03,740
I'm not hungry.

172
00:17:12,060 --> 00:17:14,579
It's better if you just hit me.

173
00:17:16,260 --> 00:17:18,300
Don't be like this, Mother.

174
00:17:29,820 --> 00:17:31,100
Forgive me.

175
00:17:32,900 --> 00:17:34,700
If it's my choice

176
00:17:36,180 --> 00:17:40,180
deviating from the norm and not in accordance with Mother's expectations...

177
00:17:41,980 --> 00:17:43,540
But, Mother,

178
00:17:47,700 --> 00:17:50,900
love is not something anyone can control.

179
00:17:53,020 --> 00:17:55,150
I just fell in love with someone.

180
00:17:57,060 --> 00:18:01,780
Just like Mom loves Dad.

181
00:18:08,020 --> 00:18:12,420
I don't hate your love for Tuan Phra Nai.

182
00:18:15,940 --> 00:18:17,260
In that case...

183
00:18:19,140 --> 00:18:19,980
Why?

184
00:18:21,700 --> 00:18:23,700
Mom is not afraid that you love her,

185
00:18:27,060 --> 00:18:29,180
But Mom is afraid you will get hurt.

186
00:18:39,300 --> 00:18:40,180
Kaew.

187
00:18:43,100 --> 00:18:44,540
Although

188
00:18:46,900 --> 00:18:49,430
Heaven and earth can be connected to each other...

189
00:18:52,580 --> 00:18:55,910
But heavy rain falling from the sky will cause

190
00:18:56,660 --> 00:18:58,780
you're wet.

191
00:18:59,620 --> 00:19:00,820
Who feels pain

192
00:19:01,220 --> 00:19:02,620
and cold

193
00:19:04,900 --> 00:19:06,660
are people on earth, son.

194
00:19:09,060 --> 00:19:13,420
We and him are very different.

195
00:19:16,820 --> 00:19:19,100
Mom is afraid one day

196
00:19:21,100 --> 00:19:24,780
you will be the one who endures the suffering alone.

197
00:19:34,140 --> 00:19:35,540
But, Mother,

198
00:19:38,780 --> 00:19:40,340
rain in the sky

199
00:19:42,380 --> 00:19:45,940
is it not to fertilize the earth?

200
00:19:50,860 --> 00:19:52,780
Even though it will get wet,

201
00:19:54,460 --> 00:19:55,700
it'll hurt a little,

202
00:19:58,900 --> 00:20:01,700
can also make the earth full of life...

203
00:20:04,100 --> 00:20:07,420
Make trees and branches fertilize leaves.

204
00:20:13,260 --> 00:20:14,860
I'm willing to get wet,

205
00:20:15,860 --> 00:20:17,590
ready to withstand the cold.

206
00:20:21,380 --> 00:20:23,820
If the ultimate goal is love,

207
00:20:25,380 --> 00:20:27,260
I'm not afraid, Mother.

208
00:20:30,500 --> 00:20:34,420
You think that will make you happy?

209
00:20:40,460 --> 00:20:42,260
I know you're worried.

210
00:20:46,300 --> 00:20:47,580
For me,

211
00:20:51,300 --> 00:20:53,660
even though we can't be together,

212
00:20:56,820 --> 00:20:59,900
but as long as we can love each other, that's enough.

213
00:21:03,060 --> 00:21:04,180
That is it.

214
00:21:05,140 --> 00:21:07,620
Can it be called happiness, Mother?

215
00:21:12,580 --> 00:21:14,660
If you're so sure,

216
00:21:16,980 --> 00:21:20,460
I also can't destroy your love.

217
00:21:37,180 --> 00:21:40,700
Mother, is what you said true?

218
00:21:44,340 --> 00:21:46,540
The happiness of a mother

219
00:21:47,860 --> 00:21:51,100
is to see his son happy, Son.

220
00:22:00,020 --> 00:22:02,020
Thank you mom.

221
00:22:25,780 --> 00:22:27,580
Mom loves you, Kaew.

222
00:22:32,820 --> 00:22:34,740
I love you too.

223
00:22:58,580 --> 00:22:59,540
Roll.

224
00:23:01,220 --> 00:23:02,300
Good grief!

225
00:23:02,780 --> 00:23:05,240
- Help! Someone, help me... - Hey!

226
00:23:05,700 --> 00:23:06,560
Take him away.

227
00:23:07,700 --> 00:23:08,500
Ayo.

228
00:23:12,420 --> 00:23:16,260
Why is Ruedee still not here?

229
00:23:17,300 --> 00:23:18,260
Hmm.

230
00:23:18,980 --> 00:23:21,220
We've gone to his house to look for him.

231
00:23:21,220 --> 00:23:24,820
Ruedee's mother said she had gone out early in the morning.

232
00:23:25,420 --> 00:23:28,220
If so, why hasn't it arrived yet?

233
00:23:29,220 --> 00:23:31,740
Are sending people to look for him.

234
00:23:32,180 --> 00:23:36,380
It's outrageous, clearly knowing that today there is an important event.

235
00:23:37,420 --> 00:23:40,260
It's almost time to leave, Uncle.

236
00:23:40,420 --> 00:23:42,020
What to do?

237
00:23:43,780 --> 00:23:45,100
Kan, Kaew.

238
00:23:45,780 --> 00:23:47,380
You two dance.

239
00:23:47,540 --> 00:23:48,340
Ah.

240
00:23:48,900 --> 00:23:50,360
What about Ruedee?

241
00:23:51,380 --> 00:23:53,380
So, what do you want me to do?

242
00:23:58,820 --> 00:24:02,300
How about it, everyone? Still haven't found Ruedee?

243
00:24:02,860 --> 00:24:03,980
Not found.

244
00:24:04,580 --> 00:24:07,220
Ruedee, what actually happened?

245
00:24:07,820 --> 00:24:09,540
Kaew, Kaew.

246
00:24:10,060 --> 00:24:10,980
Can.

247
00:24:11,540 --> 00:24:13,200
Have you found Ruedee?

248
00:24:14,980 --> 00:24:16,660
Already know where Ruedee is.

249
00:24:17,540 --> 00:24:19,000
How do you know?

250
00:24:20,620 --> 00:24:22,260
Just like this.

251
00:24:23,140 --> 00:24:24,660
What, Uncle?

252
00:24:30,860 --> 00:24:37,460
[Dear Mr. Luang, I have to go with my lover]

253
00:24:36,860 --> 00:24:37,700
Ouch.

254
00:24:42,340 --> 00:24:44,860
We still worry about it.

255
00:24:44,860 --> 00:24:47,520
It turns out that Ruedee eloped with her lover.

256
00:24:48,100 --> 00:24:49,220
What?

257
00:24:49,860 --> 00:24:52,260
Ruedee wants to elope with her lover?

258
00:24:52,740 --> 00:24:56,940
That's right, someone delivered a letter from Ruedee to report to Sir.

259
00:24:59,820 --> 00:25:01,260
Is it true, Uncle?

260
00:25:01,820 --> 00:25:04,340
It was indeed a letter from Ruedee.

261
00:25:08,260 --> 00:25:09,180
Impossible.

262
00:25:10,220 --> 00:25:12,140
Ruedee doesn't have a boyfriend.

263
00:25:13,180 --> 00:25:14,640
How do you know?

264
00:25:14,860 --> 00:25:19,300
I heard before Ruedee eloped, she received a love letter.

265
00:25:21,140 --> 00:25:22,140
A love letter?

266
00:25:23,860 --> 00:25:26,460
You must not know about this, Kaewta.

267
00:25:27,660 --> 00:25:31,520
But whatever happens, Ruedee will not abandon his duties.

268
00:25:31,820 --> 00:25:34,660
Ruedee won't leave without saying goodbye.

269
00:25:36,460 --> 00:25:39,740
Everyone has their own reasons, Kaewta.

270
00:25:39,940 --> 00:25:40,740
Correct.

271
00:25:41,060 --> 00:25:45,720
Ruedee probably loved someone she wasn't supposed to love, then eloped.

272
00:25:45,900 --> 00:25:47,230
But I don't believe it.

273
00:25:53,740 --> 00:25:54,340
- OK. - Eh.

274
00:25:54,340 --> 00:25:55,460
- Right, hurry up. - Kaew.

275
00:25:55,460 --> 00:25:56,300
You chase him.

276
00:25:56,300 --> 00:25:56,980
Good.

277
00:26:06,300 --> 00:26:07,020
Kaew.

278
00:26:08,180 --> 00:26:08,940
Kaew.

279
00:26:09,540 --> 00:26:10,300
Kaew.

280
00:26:11,660 --> 00:26:12,740
Where are you going?

281
00:26:14,820 --> 00:26:16,480
I'm going to go look for Ruedee.

282
00:26:16,820 --> 00:26:19,150
I can't believe Ruedee will elope.

283
00:26:19,580 --> 00:26:20,740
What happened?

284
00:26:21,780 --> 00:26:23,180
Did something happen?

285
00:26:24,540 --> 00:26:26,670
Ruedee eloped with her lover.

286
00:26:35,700 --> 00:26:36,740
Kaew, anakku.

287
00:26:37,260 --> 00:26:38,260
Kaew.

288
00:26:50,020 --> 00:26:51,460
Are you awake, son?

289
00:26:52,740 --> 00:26:53,540
Mother.

290
00:26:55,780 --> 00:26:56,860
Roll.

291
00:27:00,140 --> 00:27:00,980
Roll.

292
00:27:00,980 --> 00:27:02,740
Roll!

293
00:27:02,740 --> 00:27:03,620
Kaew.

294
00:27:03,620 --> 00:27:04,540
Kaew.

295
00:27:04,540 --> 00:27:06,020
I'm here.

296
00:27:06,340 --> 00:27:07,600
How are you?

297
00:27:13,700 --> 00:27:15,820
How are you, son?

298
00:27:23,740 --> 00:27:25,200
It's okay, Mother.

299
00:27:28,420 --> 00:27:31,020
Hurry back, son. Finally you realize.

300
00:27:34,060 --> 00:27:34,900
I...

301
00:27:35,460 --> 00:27:36,900
Sorry, Mom.

302
00:27:38,020 --> 00:27:39,940
I didn't listen to Master.

303
00:27:42,500 --> 00:27:44,140
Teacher said,

304
00:27:44,860 --> 00:27:47,140
don't do this again, son.

305
00:27:47,300 --> 00:27:47,940
Of?

306
00:27:49,220 --> 00:27:51,380
If you keep getting stuck in the past,

307
00:27:52,500 --> 00:27:54,630
you may not be able to come back again.

308
00:27:56,620 --> 00:27:59,260
Mom doesn't want you to remember your past life anymore, son.

309
00:27:59,260 --> 00:28:00,180
Mother.

310
00:28:01,980 --> 00:28:03,580
You don't stop me.

311
00:28:04,540 --> 00:28:06,940
Don't get stuck in the past anymore, son.

312
00:28:06,940 --> 00:28:09,380
Don't explore it any more, it's meaningless.

313
00:28:09,380 --> 00:28:10,460
There's meaning.

314
00:28:11,060 --> 00:28:12,260
Ada.

315
00:28:13,780 --> 00:28:14,980
At least,

316
00:28:15,540 --> 00:28:20,780
I want to know how the story of me and Mr. Yai ends.

317
00:28:20,780 --> 00:28:21,780
Kaew!

318
00:28:22,740 --> 00:28:25,460
Can you please don't stop me? Please.

319
00:28:27,260 --> 00:28:27,940
Kaew.

320
00:28:27,940 --> 00:28:28,580
- Kaew. - Kaew.

321
00:28:28,580 --> 00:28:29,420
Kaew.

322
00:28:29,780 --> 00:28:32,220
Kaew, let's talk about it carefully first.

323
00:28:33,260 --> 00:28:34,300
Bibi.

324
00:28:34,580 --> 00:28:37,100
I'll talk to him.

325
00:28:42,820 --> 00:28:43,700
Kaew.

326
00:28:47,220 --> 00:28:49,860
Everything is destined.

327
00:28:50,340 --> 00:28:52,140
Even though we don't help,

328
00:28:52,460 --> 00:28:54,820
he will know it too.

329
00:29:07,900 --> 00:29:08,740
Mr. Yai.

330
00:29:10,700 --> 00:29:12,260
Are you in there?

331
00:29:18,820 --> 00:29:20,340
Mr. Yai, come out.

332
00:29:22,060 --> 00:29:24,460
Can you come out and meet me?

333
00:29:24,460 --> 00:29:25,420
Mr. Yai.

334
00:29:27,620 --> 00:29:29,220
I want to see you.

335
00:29:31,260 --> 00:29:32,220
Mr. Yai.

336
00:29:43,860 --> 00:29:44,780
Kaew.

337
00:29:49,740 --> 00:29:50,900
Roll.

338
00:30:08,740 --> 00:30:12,380
Don't be like this, Kaew. I even deliberately took you out to relax.

339
00:30:12,380 --> 00:30:15,780
Don't be like this. Don't you love works of art?

340
00:30:17,900 --> 00:30:20,020
Since that incident,

341
00:30:20,580 --> 00:30:23,460
I can't see Mr. Yai and the others anymore.

342
00:30:23,460 --> 00:30:25,590
I want to know how things are going.

343
00:30:26,700 --> 00:30:28,980
Since the time it was attacked by witches,

344
00:30:29,260 --> 00:30:31,460
You never see them again?

345
00:30:32,260 --> 00:30:32,980
Of.

346
00:30:34,500 --> 00:30:36,180
What should I do, Ruedee?

347
00:30:38,660 --> 00:30:40,460
I don't know either, Kaew.

348
00:30:42,740 --> 00:30:43,820
Oh yes.

349
00:30:43,940 --> 00:30:46,740
I went to the toilet first.

350
00:30:47,300 --> 00:30:48,700
I will be right back.

351
00:30:49,180 --> 00:30:49,860
Good.

352
00:31:19,180 --> 00:31:20,220
Uh.

353
00:31:20,380 --> 00:31:21,260
Ouch.

354
00:31:33,620 --> 00:31:34,620
Mr. Yai.

355
00:31:54,580 --> 00:31:55,260
Uh.

356
00:31:56,500 --> 00:31:57,460
Halo.

357
00:31:57,820 --> 00:31:58,620
Halo.

358
00:32:02,580 --> 00:32:03,340
Nope.

359
00:32:04,700 --> 00:32:05,900
Are you alright?

360
00:32:08,420 --> 00:32:09,950
Really very similar.

361
00:32:12,380 --> 00:32:13,460
What do you mean?

362
00:32:14,900 --> 00:32:16,420
I'm talking to you.

363
00:32:16,420 --> 00:32:17,540
Are you alright?

364
00:32:17,540 --> 00:32:18,300
Uh.

365
00:32:18,940 --> 00:32:19,980
It doesn't matter.

366
00:32:20,740 --> 00:32:22,580
I'm finally calm, you're fine.

367
00:32:22,580 --> 00:32:25,060
Sorry, I didn't pay attention.

368
00:32:27,460 --> 00:32:28,740
It's just an accident.

369
00:32:29,780 --> 00:32:31,780
I also want to apologize to you.

370
00:32:32,820 --> 00:32:33,460
Of.

371
00:32:47,220 --> 00:32:48,180
Kaew.

372
00:32:52,220 --> 00:32:54,150
I'm done, let's go.

373
00:32:54,380 --> 00:32:55,020
Of.

374
00:32:57,900 --> 00:32:58,860
Mr. Yai.

375
00:33:00,900 --> 00:33:02,180
Really Mr. Yai.

376
00:33:06,020 --> 00:33:06,620
Uh.

377
00:33:07,420 --> 00:33:08,380
Eh.

378
00:33:09,020 --> 00:33:10,940
He's not Mr. Yai, Ruedee.

379
00:33:12,060 --> 00:33:14,860
- It's impossible, isn't it? He looks a lot like... - Sorry.

380
00:33:16,620 --> 00:33:19,300
Who is Tuan Yai you mean?

381
00:33:22,980 --> 00:33:24,780
He must be a lot like me, right?

382
00:33:24,780 --> 00:33:28,240
Otherwise, you won't misrecognize me either, right?

383
00:33:29,540 --> 00:33:31,180
Really sorry.

384
00:33:32,940 --> 00:33:34,020
Let's go, Ruedee,

385
00:33:34,380 --> 00:33:35,060
Good.

386
00:33:36,220 --> 00:33:39,420
Sorry, but you really look a lot like him.

387
00:33:42,300 --> 00:33:43,020
Ayo.

388
00:33:58,700 --> 00:34:00,960
Love often appears in the blink of an eye.

389
00:34:09,020 --> 00:34:11,620
Similar. Isn't it too similar?

390
00:34:11,620 --> 00:34:15,080
It's really like the same person. But that person isn't...

391
00:34:17,420 --> 00:34:18,260
Eh.

392
00:34:19,020 --> 00:34:22,500
Otherwise, I will think he is Tuan Yai-mu.

393
00:34:26,219 --> 00:34:29,139
Well then, let's go in to take a look.

394
00:34:29,860 --> 00:34:31,320
Wait a minute, Ruedee.

395
00:34:31,940 --> 00:34:33,870
You go in to take a look first.

396
00:34:34,500 --> 00:34:35,860
I want to go home first.

397
00:34:35,860 --> 00:34:36,580
Eh?

398
00:34:37,020 --> 00:34:38,580
Where are you in a hurry to go home?

399
00:34:38,580 --> 00:34:40,060
See you later, Ruedee.

400
00:34:40,540 --> 00:34:41,179
Eh?

401
00:34:43,420 --> 00:34:44,380
Kaew.

402
00:35:00,980 --> 00:35:04,510
Oh, isn't that Kaewta? He also came to see the art exhibition?

403
00:35:06,820 --> 00:35:07,880
Do you know him?

404
00:35:08,100 --> 00:35:10,060
Oh, he is my student.

405
00:35:10,060 --> 00:35:12,060
He is a student at our university.

406
00:35:12,220 --> 00:35:12,940
Oh.

407
00:35:13,820 --> 00:35:14,740
Kaewta.

408
00:35:14,940 --> 00:35:16,400
This way, please, Master.

409
00:35:17,420 --> 00:35:18,060
Good.

410
00:35:23,980 --> 00:35:24,820
Mr. Yai.

411
00:35:25,780 --> 00:35:26,580
Kak Saen.

412
00:35:28,340 --> 00:35:29,420
Grandma Yam.

413
00:35:35,620 --> 00:35:36,620
Mr. Yai.

414
00:35:37,900 --> 00:35:39,500
Are you still here?

415
00:35:47,220 --> 00:35:48,260
Mr. Yai.

416
00:35:49,740 --> 00:35:50,900
Kak Saen.

417
00:35:52,300 --> 00:35:53,380
Grandma Yam.

418
00:35:55,260 --> 00:35:57,140
Can anyone come out?

419
00:36:00,420 --> 00:36:01,740
Tell me.

420
00:36:03,260 --> 00:36:05,990
Please let me know if you are still here.

421
00:36:17,580 --> 00:36:18,540
Kak Sin.

422
00:36:18,540 --> 00:36:19,420
Mr. Kaew.

423
00:36:41,100 --> 00:36:42,060
Mr. Yai.

424
00:36:42,260 --> 00:36:43,920
Tuan Yai, are you here?

425
00:36:44,820 --> 00:36:45,540
Ayah.

426
00:36:45,860 --> 00:36:46,860
Kak Saen.

427
00:36:47,740 --> 00:36:48,780
Grandma Yam.

428
00:36:49,540 --> 00:36:50,380
Ayah.

429
00:36:52,100 --> 00:36:52,780
Ayah.

430
00:37:08,780 --> 00:37:12,640
Since coming home from the hospital, I never saw them again.

431
00:37:14,060 --> 00:37:17,180
Either Mr. Yai or Grandma Yam, and...

432
00:37:18,500 --> 00:37:19,380
Ayah.

433
00:37:22,300 --> 00:37:23,820
They are still here.

434
00:37:27,860 --> 00:37:29,460
That's what my heart says.

435
00:38:08,020 --> 00:38:09,700
Kaewta-ku.

436
00:38:26,380 --> 00:38:28,440
As the Master once said,

437
00:38:29,140 --> 00:38:31,500
all souls are still here.

438
00:38:35,140 --> 00:38:36,060
In that case,

439
00:38:37,140 --> 00:38:40,000
why can't I see them anymore, Sis Sin?

440
00:38:42,780 --> 00:38:46,340
From childhood to adulthood, I could always see my father's soul.

441
00:38:48,060 --> 00:38:50,460
There is no day that you can't see it.

442
00:38:52,020 --> 00:38:53,020
Pages,

443
00:38:55,380 --> 00:38:59,840
perhaps because the karmic power of their reincarnation in this life is already full.

444
00:39:03,020 --> 00:39:04,940
The power of reincarnation karma is full?

445
00:39:04,940 --> 00:39:05,660
Correct.

446
00:39:07,420 --> 00:39:08,580
We

447
00:39:09,860 --> 00:39:12,320
shouldn't be able to see them anymore.

448
00:39:21,820 --> 00:39:26,020
Is there any way we can meet them again?

449
00:39:28,060 --> 00:39:32,500
Even if I could just see them and say goodbye, that would be enough.

450
00:39:35,500 --> 00:39:37,960
Because karma has blinded their eyes.

451
00:39:39,300 --> 00:39:42,500
Only virtue can alleviate this karma.

452
00:39:43,660 --> 00:39:44,980
The teacher once said,

453
00:39:46,340 --> 00:39:47,800
sin cannot be erased.

454
00:39:48,580 --> 00:39:52,060
One must do good to escape sin.

455
00:39:52,060 --> 00:39:53,540
Escape from sin by doing good?

456
00:39:53,540 --> 00:39:54,420
Correct.

457
00:39:56,100 --> 00:39:58,660
Good and bad deeds are counted separately.

458
00:39:58,660 --> 00:40:01,720
That is why sin cannot simply be erased.

459
00:40:01,820 --> 00:40:04,820
But fortunately, we can escape from it.

460
00:40:05,140 --> 00:40:08,540
And escaping from sin is not difficult.

461
00:40:09,540 --> 00:40:13,070
Do you want to get away immediately or do it slowly?

462
00:40:27,420 --> 00:40:28,220
Kak Sin.

463
00:40:28,220 --> 00:40:28,820
Of.

464
00:40:29,780 --> 00:40:32,240
Let's help everyone together.

465
00:40:33,140 --> 00:40:34,220
Good, Mr. Kaew.

466
00:41:28,460 --> 00:41:32,260
Are Mr. Kaew and Sin gathering welfare for us?

467
00:41:32,660 --> 00:41:33,380
That's right.

468
00:41:39,860 --> 00:41:40,700
they go out

469
00:41:41,980 --> 00:41:42,620
Of.

470
00:41:43,300 --> 00:41:44,100
Don't go.

471
00:41:49,740 --> 00:41:52,200
Is it really good to do this?

472
00:41:57,020 --> 00:41:58,420
Don't you remember?

473
00:41:59,660 --> 00:42:01,790
After Grandma Yam left us,

474
00:42:04,140 --> 00:42:05,540
how are we?

475
00:42:08,900 --> 00:42:10,380
Mr. Yai.

476
00:42:16,420 --> 00:42:18,460
Mr. Yai.

477
00:42:26,100 --> 00:42:27,260
You also know

478
00:42:28,580 --> 00:42:30,700
Our time is also running out.

479
00:42:32,780 --> 00:42:36,860
However, is it really good to just leave without a sound?

480
00:43:23,060 --> 00:43:23,900
Kak Sin.

481
00:43:26,540 --> 00:43:27,380
Kak Sin.

482
00:43:28,980 --> 00:43:29,860
Kak Sin.

483
00:43:31,340 --> 00:43:32,460
Yes, Mr. Kaew.

484
00:43:34,260 --> 00:43:36,390
Did you see Dad and Mr. Yai?

485
00:43:49,820 --> 00:43:52,620
Are you around here, Mr. Yai?

486
00:44:12,380 --> 00:44:13,140
Mr. Kaew.

487
00:44:14,180 --> 00:44:17,910
Do you want to eat something? I will prepare it for you.

488
00:44:19,100 --> 00:44:20,830
Sis Sin, you eat first.

489
00:44:21,980 --> 00:44:24,310
I really couldn't eat anything.

490
00:44:26,700 --> 00:44:28,380
If so, so am I.

491
00:44:29,740 --> 00:44:31,200
I can't eat either.

492
00:44:40,820 --> 00:44:43,350
The charity we collect for them,

493
00:44:44,660 --> 00:44:49,100
will it really reach Tuan Yai and the others?

494
00:44:53,940 --> 00:44:55,540
Dad used to say,

495
00:44:55,900 --> 00:45:00,630
the human world is the single easiest place to accumulate virtue.

496
00:45:01,100 --> 00:45:03,500
I believe in the virtues that we collect

497
00:45:03,660 --> 00:45:05,590
will definitely reach Mr. Yai,

498
00:45:05,820 --> 00:45:08,980
Father, and also Grandmother Yam.

499
00:45:10,140 --> 00:45:13,200
Why can't we still see them, Sis Sin?

500
00:45:21,060 --> 00:45:22,460
Wow, kid.

501
00:45:24,460 --> 00:45:25,380
Mother.

502
00:45:29,900 --> 00:45:31,820
Well then, I'll put this bag away first.

503
00:45:31,820 --> 00:45:32,460
Good.

504
00:45:42,660 --> 00:45:46,380
Actually, Mom can stay at Ruedee's house temporarily.

505
00:45:50,700 --> 00:45:55,180
I told Auntie, but she still insisted on going back to live with you.

506
00:45:58,540 --> 00:46:01,740
How could Mother leave you alone here?

507
00:46:02,060 --> 00:46:02,860
Hmm?

508
00:46:04,900 --> 00:46:07,100
How could I be alone, Mother?

509
00:46:08,100 --> 00:46:09,780
There's still Sis Sin here,

510
00:46:10,500 --> 00:46:13,540
and also... Tuan Yai and others.

511
00:46:22,340 --> 00:46:23,420
So,

512
00:46:24,180 --> 00:46:27,110
have you seen Mr. Yai and the others?

513
00:46:29,860 --> 00:46:30,820
Not yet.

514
00:46:36,580 --> 00:46:37,500
Of.

515
00:46:38,740 --> 00:46:42,900
If you want to stay here, by their side,

516
00:46:43,620 --> 00:46:45,150
Mother will not forbid you.

517
00:46:57,900 --> 00:47:00,140
Even though he has been reincarnated,

518
00:47:00,140 --> 00:47:03,670
Mother still loves me and understands me as usual.

519
00:47:03,900 --> 00:47:05,580
It hasn't changed at all.

520
00:47:07,340 --> 00:47:08,260
But,

521
00:47:09,460 --> 00:47:11,390
Mother only asks one thing from you.

522
00:47:13,740 --> 00:47:15,140
What is it, Mother?

523
00:47:16,740 --> 00:47:20,060
School has started, you have to go to school, son.

524
00:47:21,340 --> 00:47:22,580
Ouch, Mother.

525
00:47:23,900 --> 00:47:25,300
I thought there was something wrong.

526
00:47:25,900 --> 00:47:28,430
I will not abandon my education.

527
00:47:53,220 --> 00:47:53,980
You...

528
00:47:56,060 --> 00:47:57,540
You didn't disappear?

529
00:47:58,460 --> 00:47:59,900
And Kaew Bilang.

530
00:48:04,740 --> 00:48:06,940
There is something I want to ask from you.

531
00:48:20,300 --> 00:48:23,760
There. Sis Chai seems to be talking to someone.

532
00:48:25,380 --> 00:48:27,380
But there was no one, Kaew.

533
00:48:30,700 --> 00:48:31,580
Could it be...

534
00:48:33,180 --> 00:48:33,860
Eh.

535
00:48:48,540 --> 00:48:50,740
Why did you come to beg me?

536
00:48:53,300 --> 00:48:57,160
Because I know what kind of feelings you have for Kaew.

537
00:49:03,620 --> 00:49:05,350
If you want to do that,

538
00:49:06,340 --> 00:49:07,700
then don't regret it.

539
00:49:13,140 --> 00:49:13,980
Thank You.

540
00:49:17,940 --> 00:49:19,020
Kak Chai.

541
00:49:27,740 --> 00:49:30,070
Who was Sis Chai talking to earlier?

542
00:49:31,820 --> 00:49:33,380
Eh...

543
00:49:40,420 --> 00:49:41,180
Talk?

544
00:49:41,860 --> 00:49:43,060
Talk to whom?

545
00:49:43,860 --> 00:49:45,790
I didn't talk to anyone.

546
00:49:46,820 --> 00:49:48,220
But just now...

547
00:49:48,940 --> 00:49:49,860
Kaew.

548
00:49:53,780 --> 00:49:56,510
Then why is Sis Chai standing here alone?

549
00:49:57,420 --> 00:49:59,340
I went out for a walk alone.

550
00:49:59,340 --> 00:50:02,340
The weather is really nice, so I'm humming.

551
00:50:02,860 --> 00:50:04,660
It's really just that.

552
00:50:05,980 --> 00:50:07,020
Is that true?

553
00:50:07,980 --> 00:50:09,780
I think Sis Chai...

554
00:50:10,420 --> 00:50:12,080
Did you see Mr. Yai?

555
00:50:16,500 --> 00:50:17,340
Kaew.

556
00:50:18,340 --> 00:50:21,000
If he doesn't want to let you see it,

557
00:50:21,100 --> 00:50:23,630
how could he let me see him?

558
00:50:27,060 --> 00:50:28,100
That is true.

559
00:50:29,740 --> 00:50:30,500
Kaew.
