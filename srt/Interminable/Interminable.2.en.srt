00:00:10,640 --> 00:00:12,680
[Previously]
Khun Phra Nai had this white house built…

3
00:00:12,680 --> 00:00:14,880
in hopes of living with his lover here.

4
00:00:15,160 --> 00:00:16,720
You finally came back to me.

5
00:00:17,400 --> 00:00:18,680
My dear Chuichai.

6
00:00:19,360 --> 00:00:23,040
I feel strangely familiar with this place, Mum.

7
00:00:23,280 --> 00:00:25,280
As if it were a home I had left for so long.

8
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:28,600
We used to have a great time here together in the past.

9
00:00:28,960 --> 00:00:30,760
I thought I’d never get to see you today.

10
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:31,760
Where have you been?

11
00:00:31,760 --> 00:00:32,920
I went to Kaew’s house.

12
00:00:33,040 --> 00:00:35,640
That’s her best friend. His name is Kaewta.

13
00:00:37,240 --> 00:00:38,920
You’ve finally returned.

14
00:00:39,320 --> 00:00:40,880
Try to make merits whenever you can.

15
00:00:41,200 --> 00:00:45,160
When the time is right, you’ll finally see that person you wish to see.

16
00:00:45,440 --> 00:00:46,440
Hey!

17
00:00:47,840 --> 00:00:48,640
You!

18
00:00:51,920 --> 00:00:52,720
Hey!

19
00:00:52,720 --> 00:00:59,320
[2490 B.E.]

20
00:01:04,599 --> 00:01:06,000
You can see me, dear?

21
00:01:46,920 --> 00:01:48,200
No, you can’t.

22
00:01:54,240 --> 00:01:55,560
Where did he go?

23
00:02:09,080 --> 00:02:14,240
When the time comes, you will finally see me.

00:04:47,159 --> 00:04:48,560
Kaew!

38
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:50,760
Mum.

39
00:04:50,760 --> 00:04:52,120
Are you done giving alms to the monks?

40
00:04:53,080 --> 00:04:53,880
Yes, Mum.

41
00:04:54,880 --> 00:04:59,000
I also dedicated merits to Khun Phra Nai, the owner of this house,

42
00:04:59,520 --> 00:05:02,200
and to all the spirits here too.

43
00:05:04,480 --> 00:05:06,680
Amen.

44
00:05:11,640 --> 00:05:13,600
Let us also rejoice in your merit…

45
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:17,880
and be thankful to you on behalf of all the spirits here.

46
00:05:17,880 --> 00:05:18,640
Yes.

47
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:21,920
Amen.

48
00:05:25,520 --> 00:05:26,880
That’s right, Mum.

49
00:05:27,560 --> 00:05:32,080
Have you seen anyone walking this way earlier?

50
00:05:33,520 --> 00:05:34,440
Who is it?

51
00:05:36,240 --> 00:05:37,720
I don’t know too.

52
00:05:38,360 --> 00:05:42,000
He’s a man in a white suit.

53
00:05:44,480 --> 00:05:45,440
I didn’t see anyone.

54
00:05:48,120 --> 00:05:52,320
That’s strange. I was walking right after him but then he suddenly disappeared.

55
00:06:06,200 --> 00:06:09,120
I’ll go get you something to eat then, okay?

56
00:06:09,720 --> 00:06:10,520
Yes.

57
00:07:32,880 --> 00:07:34,640
[2455 B.E.]

58
00:07:34,640 --> 00:07:35,600
Saen.

59
00:07:36,240 --> 00:07:39,000
Are you sure this is where my dear Chuichai lives?

60
00:07:39,200 --> 00:07:43,440
Aww, is she “your dear Chuichai” now, my lord?

61
00:07:45,400 --> 00:07:46,600
Of course, I am sure.

62
00:07:46,600 --> 00:07:50,040
I already asked the servants at *Luang Sanor’s house. (*Head of Classical Thai Orchestra Bureau)

63
00:07:50,040 --> 00:07:52,680
They said the lady who performed the Chuichai dance that day…

64
00:07:52,680 --> 00:07:54,520
Her name is Payom.

65
00:08:01,560 --> 00:08:03,080
Is anybody home?

66
00:08:12,040 --> 00:08:13,240
Who are you here for?

67
00:08:13,440 --> 00:08:15,040
My name is Saen, Miss.

68
00:08:15,160 --> 00:08:17,680
And this is my brother, Khun Yai.

69
00:08:17,960 --> 00:08:18,880
Hello, Miss.

70
00:08:19,240 --> 00:08:19,960
Yes.

71
00:08:22,560 --> 00:08:25,200
Why are you here then?

72
00:08:26,680 --> 00:08:29,840
We’re looking for Lady Chuichai who performed the dance at the party…

73
00:08:29,840 --> 00:08:32,799
at His Royal Highness Prince’s palace the other day.

74
00:08:33,360 --> 00:08:35,120
The one called Payom, Miss.

75
00:08:35,640 --> 00:08:39,080
Oh, I’m afraid that’s me then.

76
00:08:44,560 --> 00:08:48,040
Your name is Payom?

77
00:08:49,400 --> 00:08:54,320
So? Why do you want to see me?

78
00:09:00,240 --> 00:09:03,480
Those servants at Luang Sanor really told me it’s Payom.

79
00:09:03,880 --> 00:09:07,840
How reckless. We could’ve been killed if that were a thief’s lair.

80
00:09:08,320 --> 00:09:11,240
Then we should just arrest them and send them to the police.

81
00:09:11,760 --> 00:09:14,880
Thief! Catch him!

82
00:09:15,760 --> 00:09:17,320
There’s a thief, Khun Yai.

83
00:09:19,480 --> 00:09:21,600
Move! Out of the way!

84
00:09:26,120 --> 00:09:27,120
Hey! Stop!

85
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:47,400
Only within an arm reach but feels so far away.

86
00:09:49,080 --> 00:09:51,080
Although he can’t see you yet,

87
00:09:51,400 --> 00:09:54,120
his heart still remembers you, Khun Yai.

88
00:09:54,960 --> 00:09:59,000
But when, Saen? When will Kaew notice me?

89
00:10:03,120 --> 00:10:04,720
That day will certainly come.

90
00:10:04,960 --> 00:10:06,840
Do you still remember what the Abbot said?

91
00:10:16,120 --> 00:10:17,920
Souls that are bonded…

92
00:10:18,880 --> 00:10:21,400
cannot stay parted forever.

93
00:10:28,640 --> 00:10:31,880
That’s right but…

94
00:10:33,280 --> 00:10:35,240
Everything happens in its own time.

95
00:10:39,240 --> 00:10:44,080
When that day comes, I shall never let him go ever again.

96
00:10:47,280 --> 00:10:49,320
May that day arrive soon.

97
00:11:14,280 --> 00:11:15,600
Kaewta.

98
00:11:21,080 --> 00:11:23,160
That’s Ruedee’s best friend.

99
00:11:23,160 --> 00:11:24,520
His name is Kaewta.

100
00:11:24,640 --> 00:11:26,000
Kaewta?

101
00:11:29,720 --> 00:11:30,520
Be careful, dear.

102
00:11:31,640 --> 00:11:32,400
Sister.

103
00:11:32,400 --> 00:11:34,080
Does it hurt a lot, dear?

104
00:11:34,920 --> 00:11:36,200
Kaewta!

105
00:11:38,720 --> 00:11:40,720
Why was I so furious?

106
00:11:44,280 --> 00:11:45,840
Miss Sophee.

107
00:11:46,200 --> 00:11:49,360
Miss Nid and Miss Ruedee are here to see you. Would you like them to come up now?

108
00:11:50,720 --> 00:11:51,760
Let them in.

109
00:11:52,080 --> 00:11:52,880
Yes, ma’am.

110
00:11:54,960 --> 00:11:56,200
Hello, Aunt Nid.

111
00:11:59,160 --> 00:12:00,640
Hello, Sister.

112
00:12:04,680 --> 00:12:09,120
I heard you have a fever, so I’m a bit worried.

113
00:12:09,520 --> 00:12:12,080
How are you feeling, dear?

114
00:12:13,040 --> 00:12:15,520
Much better now. A few more days and I’ll be as good as new.

115
00:12:15,520 --> 00:12:17,520
Thank you so much for your concern, Aunty.

116
00:12:17,520 --> 00:12:19,680
You shouldn’t have troubled yourself coming all the way here.

117
00:12:21,480 --> 00:12:26,360
My mother would like to invite you to my brother’s welcome back party.

118
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:30,160
Is he returning from abroad soon?

119
00:12:31,360 --> 00:12:32,160
Yes.

120
00:12:34,200 --> 00:12:37,000
How wonderful. I’d absolutely be there.

121
00:12:37,320 --> 00:12:39,880
I also have something for you.

122
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:43,120
What is it?

123
00:12:50,920 --> 00:12:52,160
Here, take it.

124
00:13:13,840 --> 00:13:15,040
This hairpin…

125
00:13:16,960 --> 00:13:20,840
is an inheritance from my cousin Sophee.

126
00:13:26,640 --> 00:13:28,200
It looks so familiar.

127
00:13:34,640 --> 00:13:39,880
Sophee, I think this pin belongs to you, dear.

128
00:13:41,400 --> 00:13:42,640
Is it for me?

129
00:13:44,160 --> 00:13:49,040
Yes, think of it as a gift to welcome you back.

130
00:14:07,920 --> 00:14:10,800
[2455 B.E.]

131
00:14:11,080 --> 00:14:13,240
Can you please put it on for me?

132
00:14:14,440 --> 00:14:16,760
Of course. Come.

133
00:14:28,360 --> 00:14:29,640
Thank you.

134
00:14:30,200 --> 00:14:32,840
You look beautiful with this hairpin on you.

135
00:14:41,560 --> 00:14:44,000
Shall the next life truly exist…

136
00:14:45,440 --> 00:14:55,200
I solemnly vow to remember this love and pain…

137
00:15:01,320 --> 00:15:03,640
and shall get back at all of them!

138
00:15:18,320 --> 00:15:19,800
What’s wrong, dear?

139
00:15:20,080 --> 00:15:24,240
Sister, are you all right? Sister!

140
00:15:50,520 --> 00:15:53,240
- Sophee!
 - Anyone, fetch me an inhaler!

141
00:15:53,240 --> 00:15:54,960
Sophee just fainted. Quickly!

142
00:15:54,960 --> 00:15:57,040
An inhaler!

143
00:16:06,040 --> 00:16:08,360
The moment she touched that hairpin,

144
00:16:08,640 --> 00:16:13,800
she screamed so loud and fainted right in front of me and my mother.

145
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:16,360
Was it that bad?

146
00:16:17,600 --> 00:16:22,520
Kaew, I think there’s a ghost trapped in that pin.

147
00:16:23,400 --> 00:16:25,080
Nonsense, Ruedee.

148
00:16:25,480 --> 00:16:28,520
What kind of ghost will live in such a tiny pin like that?

149
00:16:30,520 --> 00:16:34,640
You didn’t see what she was like after she became conscious.

150
00:16:35,640 --> 00:16:36,440
Why?

151
00:16:37,640 --> 00:16:39,920
It was very strange and also…

152
00:16:40,760 --> 00:16:42,440
very scary.

153
00:16:45,960 --> 00:16:48,760
Mother, she already came to.

154
00:16:49,560 --> 00:16:50,360
Sister.

155
00:16:54,320 --> 00:16:55,400
Sister.

156
00:17:02,360 --> 00:17:03,400
Nid.

157
00:17:04,680 --> 00:17:05,480
Yes.

158
00:17:09,160 --> 00:17:11,680
How are you feeling, Sister?

159
00:17:12,040 --> 00:17:13,160
I’m fine!

160
00:17:13,680 --> 00:17:18,720
Are you sure, dear? You screamed so loud everyone here got frightened.

161
00:17:18,720 --> 00:17:20,200
Then you fainted.

162
00:17:20,200 --> 00:17:21,800
It was just a bad dream.

163
00:17:27,280 --> 00:17:29,480
When she looked at me,

164
00:17:30,480 --> 00:17:33,440
I felt so creepy and had goosebumps all over.

165
00:17:34,440 --> 00:17:38,640
You know how I usually don’t like her and am quite scared of her.

166
00:17:39,560 --> 00:17:43,600
But now, it’s even worse.

167
00:17:44,320 --> 00:17:51,280
As if I might be dead if I spent just a minute longer in her presence.

168
00:17:53,360 --> 00:17:55,400
You’re overthinking, Ruedee.

169
00:17:56,120 --> 00:17:57,800
She’s your sister somehow.

170
00:17:59,800 --> 00:18:05,280
She might be just a cousin, but you two are still related so I don't think she'd hurt you.

171
00:18:05,800 --> 00:18:09,440
I don’t know. But I’m scared.

172
00:18:17,560 --> 00:18:18,840
Sophee.

173
00:18:54,080 --> 00:18:59,840
This pin is proof that I was the first one he loved.

174
00:19:00,920 --> 00:19:03,760
You look beautiful with this hairpin on you.

175
00:19:04,240 --> 00:19:07,920
I still remember how you used to practise making garlands for the monks.

176
00:19:07,920 --> 00:19:11,120
She grew up so quickly, Father.

177
00:19:12,240 --> 00:19:15,400
Thank you, Yai. You were on a business trip…

178
00:19:15,400 --> 00:19:18,440
but still didn’t forget to buy me and your sister gifts.

179
00:19:19,400 --> 00:19:23,080
Next time, just buy it for her only.

180
00:19:24,720 --> 00:19:25,760
How could I?

181
00:19:26,080 --> 00:19:28,600
Since my parents passed away,

182
00:19:28,600 --> 00:19:30,880
you have always taken good care of me, Father.

183
00:19:31,400 --> 00:19:33,640
These gifts are indeed nothing…

184
00:19:33,640 --> 00:19:36,120
compared to your kindness in caring and raising me up.

185
00:20:06,760 --> 00:20:09,280
No matter how far…

186
00:20:10,720 --> 00:20:12,720
or how many lives I must live,

187
00:20:15,480 --> 00:20:17,760
I will find you, my love.

188
00:20:38,640 --> 00:20:39,960
Kaewta!

189
00:20:56,560 --> 00:20:58,040
Why are you dressed up today?

190
00:21:07,400 --> 00:21:09,280
What’s with being so meticulous?

191
00:21:14,840 --> 00:21:16,000
Kaewta!

192
00:21:16,160 --> 00:21:16,960
Kaewta!

193
00:21:18,400 --> 00:21:19,640
Kaew.

194
00:21:20,720 --> 00:21:22,120
Mum.

195
00:21:23,800 --> 00:21:25,040
Are you leaving, dear?

196
00:21:25,320 --> 00:21:28,560
Yes, I’ll probably be home late tonight.

197
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:32,880
But don’t worry, Ruedee has promised to drop me off.

198
00:21:34,080 --> 00:21:35,480
Just take care of yourself.

199
00:21:36,560 --> 00:21:38,600
Yes. I’m going then.

200
00:21:39,640 --> 00:21:41,360
- Goodbye.
 - Bye.

201
00:21:46,080 --> 00:21:47,320
Why would he be home late?

202
00:21:51,800 --> 00:21:53,800
Why do you have to come home late?

203
00:21:54,120 --> 00:21:55,160
I’m worried.

204
00:21:57,200 --> 00:22:00,600
Where are you going, Kaewta?

205
00:22:02,200 --> 00:22:04,320
Kaewta, I’m talking to you!

206
00:22:06,360 --> 00:22:07,040
Kaew!

207
00:22:10,080 --> 00:22:12,360
Kaewta, are you all right?

208
00:22:14,040 --> 00:22:15,360
Sin! Saen!

209
00:22:16,640 --> 00:22:17,400
Come help Kaew!

210
00:22:17,400 --> 00:22:18,120
Khun Kaew!

211
00:22:18,120 --> 00:22:18,920
Khun Kaew!

212
00:22:19,240 --> 00:22:20,040
What happened?

213
00:22:20,080 --> 00:22:21,160
Are you all right?

214
00:22:21,240 --> 00:22:22,280
I just tripped.

215
00:22:22,760 --> 00:22:23,880
Sin, go get the first-aid kit.

216
00:22:24,560 --> 00:22:25,360
Go!

217
00:22:25,400 --> 00:22:27,760
Please be careful. Can you get up?

218
00:22:28,400 --> 00:22:29,280
Yes.

219
00:22:34,440 --> 00:22:36,800
I’m okay, Saen.

220
00:22:40,520 --> 00:22:43,120
Is watching you like this the only thing I can do?

221
00:22:47,560 --> 00:22:49,120
Do you think you can walk?

222
00:22:50,160 --> 00:22:51,160
Yes.

223
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:54,560
At least it’s not so swollen.

224
00:22:57,640 --> 00:22:59,640
But you still have to be careful though.

225
00:23:00,520 --> 00:23:01,160
Saen!

226
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:03,280
Yes?

227
00:23:08,200 --> 00:23:09,360
Can you see it?

228
00:23:10,120 --> 00:23:11,280
See what?

229
00:23:13,720 --> 00:23:15,560
I can come out of the white house now.

230
00:23:16,640 --> 00:23:17,960
You’re right, Khun Yai!

231
00:23:19,320 --> 00:23:20,240
Saen,

232
00:23:22,040 --> 00:23:23,560
who are you talking to?

233
00:23:25,760 --> 00:23:28,120
Sin! Did you find it?

234
00:23:28,800 --> 00:23:29,960
Yes, coming!

235
00:23:30,440 --> 00:23:31,320
Hurry up.

236
00:23:34,360 --> 00:23:35,520
Here you go.

237
00:23:36,160 --> 00:23:37,240
Go tend the wound for him.

238
00:23:37,880 --> 00:23:38,920
Where is it, Khun Kaew?

239
00:23:43,240 --> 00:23:47,440
It might be because of Kaew or…

240
00:23:48,800 --> 00:23:54,520
perhaps it’s not the white house that traps me inside…

241
00:23:57,360 --> 00:23:59,080
but rather my own heart.

242
00:23:59,360 --> 00:24:03,120
I’m trapped inside my own heart only to wait for him.

243
00:24:08,520 --> 00:24:10,200
It’s about time, Khun Yai.

244
00:24:10,760 --> 00:24:14,280
It’s time for your spirit to become free from such interminable wait.

245
00:24:23,240 --> 00:24:25,440
There you go. You should be fine soon.

246
00:24:26,240 --> 00:24:27,760
Go get the car then.

247
00:24:27,760 --> 00:24:28,520
To drop Khun Kaew off.

248
00:24:28,600 --> 00:24:29,560
Okay.

249
00:24:33,760 --> 00:24:35,920
Please wait for Sin to get the car first.

250
00:24:50,120 --> 00:24:51,960
It’s really nothing at all.

251
00:25:07,720 --> 00:25:09,120
It’s good that you’re fine.

252
00:25:15,920 --> 00:25:20,200
Listen, why do you have to dress up so meticulously for someone else’s party?

253
00:25:20,200 --> 00:25:22,360
You’re only a guest, not the host.

254
00:25:35,200 --> 00:25:36,760
Here you go, Khun Kaew.

255
00:25:37,200 --> 00:25:38,240
Thank you, Sin.

256
00:25:38,400 --> 00:25:39,200
My pleasure.

257
00:25:40,640 --> 00:25:41,440
Sin.

258
00:25:45,120 --> 00:25:47,840
Why? Are you getting possessive?

259
00:25:49,800 --> 00:25:51,800
I was just stating the fact.

260
00:25:53,840 --> 00:25:55,960
Oh, right.

261
00:26:01,120 --> 00:26:02,680
Who are you talking to?

262
00:26:03,120 --> 00:26:05,320
No one. I wasn’t talking to anyone.

263
00:26:07,920 --> 00:26:09,640
See? There’s no one else here.

264
00:26:11,880 --> 00:26:14,640
I think we’d better hurry or we might be late.

265
00:26:16,360 --> 00:26:17,520
Please.

266
00:26:23,320 --> 00:26:27,440
Wow, are you really not possessive?

267
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:31,560
Are you talking to me?

268
00:26:32,880 --> 00:26:35,440
Of course, I’m talking to you.

269
00:26:35,840 --> 00:26:39,560
I mean if you’re going to attend someone else’s party,

270
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:43,440
it’s important to be very meticulous in what you’ll be wearing…

271
00:26:43,720 --> 00:26:45,200
in order to show respect to the host.

272
00:26:47,080 --> 00:26:49,320
Is what I’m wearing meticulous?

273
00:26:50,160 --> 00:26:51,120
Very much.

274
00:26:51,480 --> 00:26:52,440
- Sin.
- Yes?

275
00:26:52,760 --> 00:26:54,160
Shut up and drive!!

276
00:26:54,440 --> 00:26:57,680
Yes, sir. Let’s get going, Khun Kaew.

277
00:27:05,800 --> 00:27:07,520
Hello, Uncle and Aunty.

278
00:27:09,440 --> 00:27:14,760
Do you know Ruedee has been waiting for you all morning?

279
00:27:15,160 --> 00:27:17,680
She’s afraid her bestie might bail on her.

280
00:27:19,000 --> 00:27:20,520
Why would I do that?

281
00:27:21,120 --> 00:27:22,960
A promise is a promise.

282
00:27:24,360 --> 00:27:25,600
That’s right, my bestie.

283
00:27:32,280 --> 00:27:33,120
Sin.

284
00:27:33,120 --> 00:27:33,640
Yes?

285
00:27:33,760 --> 00:27:34,880
Thank you for dropping me off.

286
00:27:34,960 --> 00:27:36,000
You’re welcome.

287
00:27:36,200 --> 00:27:37,920
You can go back first.

288
00:27:38,520 --> 00:27:39,880
I can go home myself.

289
00:27:40,040 --> 00:27:41,920
You can’t do that. My da…

290
00:27:44,240 --> 00:27:48,520
I mean, Saen, he has ordered me to wait for you and take you home after the party.

291
00:27:49,240 --> 00:27:50,240
But…

292
00:27:50,600 --> 00:27:53,320
It’s all right, Khun Kaew. I can wait.

293
00:27:53,440 --> 00:27:54,840
It’s fine, Kaew.

294
00:27:54,840 --> 00:27:58,280
If Sin wants to wait, then let him.

295
00:27:58,760 --> 00:28:02,280
He will also get to have some eye-opening experience at a party like this.

296
00:28:04,280 --> 00:28:07,040
You don’t have to worry about him, Kaewta.

297
00:28:07,960 --> 00:28:08,920
Okay then.

298
00:28:09,960 --> 00:28:11,920
Let’s go, Kaew.

299
00:28:12,280 --> 00:28:14,160
I have everything ready.

300
00:28:16,720 --> 00:28:19,200
Come, let’s go.

301
00:28:19,880 --> 00:28:21,480
Follow me.

302
00:28:25,960 --> 00:28:27,520
Make yourself comfortable, Sin.

303
00:28:28,040 --> 00:28:29,000
Thank you, sir.

304
00:28:34,640 --> 00:28:35,680
It’s done, ma’am.

305
00:28:40,720 --> 00:28:42,000
Put this hairpin on for me.

306
00:28:59,320 --> 00:29:03,080
It looks very antique. Is it an inheritance from your ancestors, ma’am?

307
00:29:04,440 --> 00:29:08,600
No, it has always belonged to me from the beginning.

308
00:29:16,080 --> 00:29:20,040
How long has it been since I last put it on?

309
00:30:03,640 --> 00:30:05,320
Hello, Sophee.

310
00:30:06,400 --> 00:30:07,200
Hello.

311
00:30:10,120 --> 00:30:11,400
Sophee.

312
00:30:13,000 --> 00:30:14,680
Sophee.

313
00:30:19,760 --> 00:30:21,080
Chai

314
00:30:22,320 --> 00:30:23,120
Yes, Mother?

315
00:30:23,200 --> 00:30:25,080
Do you remember who this is?

316
00:30:30,760 --> 00:30:32,000
Sophee?

317
00:30:33,960 --> 00:30:35,560
Is it really you?

318
00:30:36,240 --> 00:30:38,240
You’ve grown up to be such a pretty lady.

319
00:30:39,280 --> 00:30:40,480
Your gift, Brother.

320
00:30:48,160 --> 00:30:49,560
Thank you so much.

321
00:30:49,680 --> 00:30:52,480
It’s already been a pleasure to have you at my party.

322
00:30:53,000 --> 00:30:54,760
Now you even came bearing me gift.

323
00:30:54,920 --> 00:30:55,960
I couldn’t be more thankful.

324
00:30:56,640 --> 00:30:59,640
Please don’t be. You’re Aunt Nid’s son,

325
00:30:59,640 --> 00:31:02,680
my very beloved aunt. We’re considered close cousins.

326
00:31:02,880 --> 00:31:06,920
Aww, how I wish you were my blood sister instead.

327
00:31:07,400 --> 00:31:10,160
Unlike my own sister, she doesn’t have any gift for me.

328
00:31:13,160 --> 00:31:14,120
Ahem!

329
00:31:17,280 --> 00:31:20,400
Who said I don’t have a gift for you, Brother?

330
00:31:26,280 --> 00:31:28,200
Hello, Sister.

331
00:31:30,080 --> 00:31:33,840
Both you and Mother just wait and see.

332
00:31:34,760 --> 00:31:35,640
Okay.

333
00:31:38,400 --> 00:31:42,880
Father, please also look forward to what gift I’ll give to my brother.

334
00:31:43,160 --> 00:31:44,320
Yes, my dear.

335
00:31:46,200 --> 00:31:47,720
You reincarnated, Sophee.

336
00:31:51,160 --> 00:31:53,600
Let’s go, Sophee.

337
00:32:09,240 --> 00:32:10,120
Sin.

338
00:32:10,360 --> 00:32:10,640
Yes?

339
00:32:10,640 --> 00:32:12,960
I brought you some snacks. Please have them.

340
00:32:14,160 --> 00:32:14,960
Thank you.

341
00:32:18,160 --> 00:32:19,240
How kind.

342
00:32:22,440 --> 00:32:23,240
Oh, it’s good.

343
00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:28,800
Khun Yai.

344
00:32:29,000 --> 00:32:29,480
Sin.

345
00:32:29,800 --> 00:32:31,280
What are you doing here?

346
00:32:31,640 --> 00:32:32,760
Have you seen Kaewta?

347
00:32:32,960 --> 00:32:33,760
No, sir.

348
00:32:34,560 --> 00:32:36,200
Go find out where he is.

349
00:32:36,840 --> 00:32:37,960
- Yes.
- Go!

350
00:32:56,920 --> 00:32:59,400
Brother, this way.

351
00:34:00,920 --> 00:34:02,000
Kaewta!

352
00:34:03,920 --> 00:34:06,080
Now I know you also reincarnated.

353
00:34:08,040 --> 00:34:09,120
It’s too late.

354
00:34:44,280 --> 00:34:45,199
Khun Kaew.

355
00:34:45,679 --> 00:34:47,360
Shall we go home now?

356
00:34:49,040 --> 00:34:52,280
What? Do you want me to go home now?

357
00:34:52,480 --> 00:34:55,600
That’s right. Your performance is done, isn’t it?

358
00:34:55,600 --> 00:34:57,280
I think we’d better go home then.

359
00:35:00,760 --> 00:35:03,120
But I still haven’t greeted the host.

360
00:35:04,200 --> 00:35:08,280
Also, Ruedee told me earlier that she’d introduce her brother to me.

361
00:35:09,360 --> 00:35:12,600
It’d be quite rude of me to leave now.

362
00:35:13,000 --> 00:35:13,480
Sin,

363
00:35:14,080 --> 00:35:16,160
Just pretend you’re sick or have a headache.

364
00:35:16,640 --> 00:35:19,000
Kaewta is soft-hearted, he’ll definitely go back with you.

365
00:35:20,960 --> 00:35:23,040
Sin, what’s wrong?

366
00:35:23,040 --> 00:35:24,280
I suddenly have a headache.

367
00:35:25,520 --> 00:35:26,440
Are you okay?

368
00:35:26,840 --> 00:35:28,960
I don’t think so, Khun Kaew.

369
00:35:29,320 --> 00:35:31,560
Ouch, why suddenly a headache?

370
00:35:35,840 --> 00:35:36,680
Fine, let’s go home.

371
00:35:37,640 --> 00:35:38,440
Yes.

372
00:35:39,880 --> 00:35:40,600
Kaew!

373
00:35:41,680 --> 00:35:42,960
I see you’ve finished changing.

374
00:35:42,960 --> 00:35:47,880
Why are you loitering here? All the guests are asking about you.

375
00:35:47,880 --> 00:35:49,040
Let’s go.

376
00:35:49,280 --> 00:35:52,320
Wait, Ruedee. Sin is not feeling well.

377
00:35:54,880 --> 00:35:56,880
So, I might have to go home now.

378
00:35:58,560 --> 00:35:59,800
You’re not feeling well?

379
00:35:59,800 --> 00:36:00,400
Yes.

380
00:36:00,680 --> 00:36:03,640
How fortunate of you. We do have a guest here who’s also a doctor.

381
00:36:03,760 --> 00:36:07,200
I’ll ask my servant to tell the doctor to check on you, Sin.

382
00:36:07,560 --> 00:36:08,680
Let’s go, Kaew.

383
00:36:09,720 --> 00:36:10,520
Sin!

384
00:36:11,800 --> 00:36:14,200
My head is bursting. My stomach hurts. What to do?

385
00:36:14,440 --> 00:36:17,200
I’ll go get the doctor now.

386
00:36:17,360 --> 00:36:18,280
Let’s go, Kaew.

387
00:36:18,480 --> 00:36:20,400
Khun Kaew, wait! Khun Kaew!

388
00:36:20,680 --> 00:36:23,000
Ouch, my head and stomach hurt. Khun Kaew!

389
00:36:28,240 --> 00:36:30,200
Sin, you’re so useless.

390
00:36:30,840 --> 00:36:32,880
Oh, come on, Khun Yai.

391
00:36:33,560 --> 00:36:35,000
I’m doing all I can here.

392
00:36:36,040 --> 00:36:37,160
What do you expect me to tell him then?

393
00:36:37,360 --> 00:36:41,400
Should I just tell him, “Khun Kaew, Khun Yai is glaring at me right now”?

394
00:36:41,400 --> 00:36:42,240
Should I?

395
00:36:52,320 --> 00:36:53,480
Brother.

396
00:36:55,520 --> 00:36:56,960
Where have you been, Ruedee?

397
00:36:59,520 --> 00:37:02,680
I went to fetch this one here.

398
00:37:02,680 --> 00:37:04,600
To introduce him to you.

399
00:37:05,160 --> 00:37:08,840
This is Kaewta, my best friend.

400
00:37:08,840 --> 00:37:11,640
The one who performed the dance earlier.

401
00:37:19,480 --> 00:37:20,880
Hello, Ruedee’s brother.

402
00:37:24,760 --> 00:37:25,720
Hello.

403
00:37:27,400 --> 00:37:28,360
Hello.

404
00:37:30,400 --> 00:37:35,520
I never thought a guy could look so beautiful dressing up as Chuichai.

405
00:37:38,560 --> 00:37:39,360
Beautiful?

406
00:37:39,960 --> 00:37:44,320
Beautiful? Did you mean Kaewta?

407
00:37:50,040 --> 00:37:54,560
Yes. I mean, he danced so beautifully.

408
00:37:57,000 --> 00:37:57,800
Thank you.

409
00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:01,000
Why is he smiling?

410
00:38:02,200 --> 00:38:03,960
Don’t look at Kaew like that.

411
00:38:05,360 --> 00:38:06,680
Kaew is mine!

412
00:38:07,440 --> 00:38:11,320
Do you know that this best friend of mine…

413
00:38:11,320 --> 00:38:14,840
can dance so well despite never taking any proper dancing class.

414
00:38:15,240 --> 00:38:16,240
Is that true, Kaew?

415
00:38:16,480 --> 00:38:18,560
You’re exaggerating, Ruedee.

416
00:38:20,320 --> 00:38:24,080
When I was young, my neighbour was a classical Thai dance teacher.

417
00:38:24,400 --> 00:38:26,960
I just learnt it through observation.

418
00:38:28,240 --> 00:38:29,280
I see.

419
00:38:29,880 --> 00:38:33,280
But I agree with Ruedee that you’re certainly good at it.

420
00:38:39,720 --> 00:38:44,040
My dear, it’s time to open the dance floor.

421
00:38:44,480 --> 00:38:49,560
I think our guests probably want to start dancing now, son.

422
00:38:49,920 --> 00:38:51,760
But if the host still hasn’t initiated the first dance,

423
00:38:52,320 --> 00:38:55,320
the guests wouldn’t dare open the floor themselves.

424
00:38:56,600 --> 00:38:57,600
But Father…

425
00:38:58,520 --> 00:39:00,600
I still don’t have a dance partner.

426
00:39:01,960 --> 00:39:03,640
How about Lady Lek, dear?

427
00:39:07,960 --> 00:39:11,880
Son, but I think Lady La-ong Dao,

428
00:39:12,280 --> 00:39:14,960
the daughter of Lord Anirut, would suit you more.

429
00:39:22,840 --> 00:39:26,680
I think Lady Lek is a perfect match for you, dear.

430
00:39:26,800 --> 00:39:29,120
But Lady La-ong Dao holds a higher status, honey.

431
00:39:29,440 --> 00:39:32,440
But Lady Lek is prettier.

432
00:39:32,440 --> 00:39:35,160
But Lady La-ong Dao is the daughter of Lord Anirut, honey.

433
00:39:35,560 --> 00:39:38,120
Father. Mother. Please stop.

434
00:39:39,280 --> 00:39:41,760
Is this a welcome back party…

435
00:39:41,760 --> 00:39:44,560
or a matchmaking party?

436
00:39:47,360 --> 00:39:48,760
Who will you choose then?

437
00:39:50,520 --> 00:39:51,320
Who?

438
00:40:05,320 --> 00:40:08,600
I think I’ve found my dance partner.

439
00:40:18,080 --> 00:40:19,400
Don’t tell me…

440
00:40:28,520 --> 00:40:32,560
Could you please dance with me, Kaew? Please help me.

441
00:40:40,640 --> 00:40:41,800
- Sin!
- Yes?

442
00:40:42,200 --> 00:40:43,320
You have to help me.

443
00:40:44,520 --> 00:40:45,440
What is it?

444
00:40:51,040 --> 00:40:52,400
Are you sure?

445
00:40:52,400 --> 00:40:58,120
I’m going to dance with Kaewta tonight.

446
00:41:04,280 --> 00:41:07,640
What do you mean? This is not a charade, son.

447
00:41:08,280 --> 00:41:09,320
I agree, honey.

448
00:41:09,320 --> 00:41:13,560
How can two men dance together?

449
00:41:14,200 --> 00:41:18,600
But Father, if I decide to pick one of the girls here tonight,

450
00:41:19,400 --> 00:41:21,480
the others might feel humiliated.

451
00:41:21,760 --> 00:41:24,480
I agree with him.

452
00:41:24,800 --> 00:41:27,600
Then, why don’t you just pick Ruedee…

453
00:41:27,600 --> 00:41:29,320
or your cousin, Sophee, instead?

454
00:41:30,480 --> 00:41:36,120
Father, if he chooses to dance with his own sister,

455
00:41:36,120 --> 00:41:38,400
wouldn’t all the girls here be disappointed?

456
00:41:38,680 --> 00:41:42,280
They might think none of them is good enough for him.

457
00:41:42,920 --> 00:41:45,160
Yes, Rueduee is absolutely right.

458
00:41:51,840 --> 00:41:54,440
I often saw men dance together back when I was still abroad.

459
00:42:00,840 --> 00:42:01,640
Kaew.

460
00:42:04,120 --> 00:42:05,360
Please dance with me.

461
00:42:16,520 --> 00:42:17,720
Please, Kaew.

462
00:42:17,720 --> 00:42:21,640
None of us here can help him right now except you.

463
00:42:21,640 --> 00:42:23,240
Please help him.

464
00:42:24,120 --> 00:42:25,680
Please help me, Kaew.

465
00:42:27,200 --> 00:42:28,040
Please.

466
00:42:52,840 --> 00:42:54,720
It’s time to go home, Kaewta.

467
00:42:55,680 --> 00:42:56,480
You!

468
00:43:02,320 --> 00:43:04,360
Sin, is there something wrong?

469
00:43:06,360 --> 00:43:07,160
Sin?

470
00:43:15,040 --> 00:43:16,560
Sin, what’s wrong?

471
00:43:17,040 --> 00:43:18,640
It’s time to go home, Kaewta.

472
00:43:20,080 --> 00:43:21,560
My apologies to everyone.

473
00:43:23,440 --> 00:43:24,760
Let’s go, Kaewta.

474
00:43:28,800 --> 00:43:29,600
Kaew!

475
00:43:30,360 --> 00:43:31,560
Wait, Kaew!

476
00:43:33,200 --> 00:43:34,200
What’s going on here?

477
00:43:38,560 --> 00:43:39,480
Wait.

478
00:43:41,040 --> 00:43:44,840
Dragging me out like this is very rude of you.

479
00:43:46,120 --> 00:43:49,160
I’m saving you from an awkward situation.

480
00:43:51,160 --> 00:43:54,720
Why? Or do you want to dance with that brat?

481
00:43:56,280 --> 00:43:57,800
Why do you have to be angry, Sin?

482
00:43:58,680 --> 00:44:00,640
It’s not like I want to dance with Ruedee’s brother.

483
00:44:04,000 --> 00:44:05,480
And what’s wrong with you?

484
00:44:07,600 --> 00:44:09,520
Why are you gripping so hard?

485
00:44:14,480 --> 00:44:15,440
Let’s just go home.

486
00:44:21,640 --> 00:44:22,440
Ouch!

487
00:44:23,160 --> 00:44:23,720
Sin.

488
00:44:24,640 --> 00:44:25,120
Sin!

489
00:44:26,600 --> 00:44:29,280
Sin! What’s wrong?

490
00:44:29,560 --> 00:44:30,360
Sin!

491
00:44:30,720 --> 00:44:32,160
Sin, can you hear me?

492
00:44:36,240 --> 00:44:37,080
Sin!

493
00:44:38,200 --> 00:44:40,480
Sin, can you hear me?

494
00:44:50,880 --> 00:44:51,680
You.

495
00:44:56,040 --> 00:44:56,640
Sin.

496
00:45:00,840 --> 00:45:03,560
You fainted earlier. Did you know that?

497
00:45:05,520 --> 00:45:09,160
And I saw someone here too.

498
00:45:10,840 --> 00:45:12,520
He walked that way and just disappeared.

499
00:45:13,200 --> 00:45:14,440
Oh, dear.

500
00:45:17,800 --> 00:45:19,120
What is it?

501
00:45:19,920 --> 00:45:21,560
Let’s hurry home, Khun Kaew.

502
00:45:27,080 --> 00:45:27,880
Saen!

503
00:45:28,600 --> 00:45:29,400
Saen!

504
00:45:29,800 --> 00:45:30,480
Saen!

505
00:45:30,480 --> 00:45:32,280
Geez, what’s with the ruckus?

506
00:45:32,280 --> 00:45:34,520
Don't ask now, Come here.

507
00:45:34,720 --> 00:45:35,520
What?

508
00:45:35,600 --> 00:45:36,720
We have a problem.

509
00:45:36,960 --> 00:45:37,760
What is it?

510
00:45:41,080 --> 00:45:42,600
What’s going on, dear?

511
00:45:44,120 --> 00:45:46,160
I don’t know too, Mum.

512
00:45:47,160 --> 00:45:48,640
Why didn’t you stop him then?

513
00:45:48,920 --> 00:45:54,240
How could I? You know what he’s like when he’s mad.

514
00:45:55,880 --> 00:45:56,760
Where’s he now?

515
00:45:59,480 --> 00:46:00,400
Please excuse us.

516
00:46:01,280 --> 00:46:02,960
Saen, wait for me.

517
00:46:03,200 --> 00:46:04,000
Saen!

518
00:46:12,400 --> 00:46:13,360
Khun Yai.

519
00:46:14,320 --> 00:46:15,120
Khun Yai.

520
00:46:19,080 --> 00:46:20,120
Saen.

521
00:46:33,120 --> 00:46:33,920
Khun Yai!

522
00:46:41,360 --> 00:46:45,080
[Next Episode]
I can feel there’s someone else living in this house.

523
00:46:45,320 --> 00:46:47,040
It’s just us here.

524
00:46:47,720 --> 00:46:50,720
Why does that man look so much alike the one in my dream?

525
00:46:51,040 --> 00:46:52,920
Why is he behaving suspiciously?

526
00:46:53,440 --> 00:46:54,760
There must be something in there.

527
00:46:55,920 --> 00:46:56,720
Khun Kaew!

528
00:46:57,600 --> 00:46:58,760
What are you doing here?

529
00:46:59,080 --> 00:47:01,280
Sin is always sleeping here to guard this room.

530
00:47:01,480 --> 00:47:02,880
What’s in there?

531
00:47:03,160 --> 00:47:06,440
Why is there a forbidden area for the house owner?

532
00:47:07,160 --> 00:47:09,280
Who are you? How did you get in here?

533
00:47:10,200 --> 00:47:10,920
Well…

534
00:47:11,400 --> 00:47:13,520
Why do you want to see me?

535
00:47:13,920 --> 00:47:17,080
My cousin, Sophee, wants you to draw her portrait.

536
00:47:19,320 --> 00:47:20,720
The white house…

537
00:47:34,120 --> 00:47:36,480
Have you seen Khun Yai yet?

538
00:47:37,120 --> 00:47:38,240
Actually, I have seen him.

539
00:47:38,240 --> 00:47:41,040
-You've seen him but you're not sure?
-Yes, because it was so quick and sudden.

540
00:47:42,760 --> 00:47:46,120
-Not clearly.
-Not yet. I haven't seen enough.

541
00:47:46,120 --> 00:47:47,600
What did you do in the previous scene?

542
00:47:47,600 --> 00:47:49,920
The previous scene was offering food to monks
in front of the house.

543
00:47:49,920 --> 00:47:53,560
After offering food,
I poured the water over the flowers for the merit.

544
00:47:53,560 --> 00:47:55,920
The spirits in the house are fulfilled!

545
00:47:56,280 --> 00:47:58,120
Everyone said "Amen," almost giving it away.

546
00:47:59,520 --> 00:48:01,480
We would like to rejoice in the merit.

547
00:48:01,840 --> 00:48:05,720
And thank you on behalf of all the spirits in this place.

548
00:48:06,360 --> 00:48:08,520
Amen.

549
00:48:10,560 --> 00:48:12,080
Do you see the ghost behind you?

550
00:48:12,160 --> 00:48:12,880
[He's gone.]

551
00:48:13,000 --> 00:48:13,760
[The ghost is gone.]

552
00:48:15,720 --> 00:48:16,680
The ghost is gone.

553
00:48:17,840 --> 00:48:20,120
I ate chicken noodles and I'm so full. I ate two bowls.

554
00:48:20,120 --> 00:48:21,040
[Two bowls?]

555
00:48:21,120 --> 00:48:22,520
I'm so stuffed right now.

556
00:48:33,600 --> 00:48:34,880
Is anyone here?

557
00:48:34,960 --> 00:48:36,480
Is anyone here?

558
00:48:37,840 --> 00:48:39,480
Is anyone here?

559
00:48:40,600 --> 00:48:41,800
Do you have some business?

560
00:48:42,920 --> 00:48:46,640
I'm looking for the classical dancer
who performed the Chui Chai dance at the party

561
00:48:46,880 --> 00:48:49,720
at the event of His Royal Highness, the Prince, the other day.

562
00:48:50,200 --> 00:48:51,800
The one named Payom.

563
00:48:51,960 --> 00:48:56,240
Oh, if her name is Payom, that would be me.

564
00:49:01,840 --> 00:49:04,960
Thief! Catch him!

565
00:49:05,840 --> 00:49:07,400
There’s a thief, Khun Yai.

566
00:49:09,560 --> 00:49:11,680
Move! Out of the way!

567
00:49:24,320 --> 00:49:27,800
[Walk past him, we can't see him.]

568
00:49:31,160 --> 00:49:32,320
[Where are you dressing up so handsomely to go?]

569
00:49:32,560 --> 00:49:36,920
Today, I'm going to Ruedee's house party.

570
00:49:37,600 --> 00:49:39,560
Am I speaking clearly? Rue Dee's house.

571
00:49:49,000 --> 00:49:52,640
I'm angry and irritated now.

572
00:49:52,640 --> 00:49:56,920
He's dressing up too nicely to go out.

573
00:49:57,040 --> 00:49:59,960
He is already taken.

574
00:50:00,720 --> 00:50:01,960
Of course, I'm jealous, right?

575
00:50:03,800 --> 00:50:06,160
I'm mad. I close the book and throw it away.

576
00:50:07,480 --> 00:50:09,240
I don't have much power, so this is all I can do.

577
00:50:10,800 --> 00:50:13,440
All I can do is watch him every day and smile.

578
00:50:13,760 --> 00:50:16,720
A spirit who spies on his loved one.

579
00:50:25,880 --> 00:50:26,880
Tired, I'm tired.

580
00:50:28,280 --> 00:50:30,040
-It's a long run.
-A lot of running too.

581
00:50:30,200 --> 00:50:33,840
Combined across all takes, it must be a kilometer.
It's a kilometer for sure.

582
00:50:33,840 --> 00:50:36,920
-Got some cardio.
-Khun Yai ordered Sin to go get the medicine.

583
00:50:37,120 --> 00:50:39,920
Yeah, the scene where he goes to
get the medicine, he ran a lot!

584
00:50:40,400 --> 00:50:42,760
-Ran in at first, then ran out again.
-Yes, sir.

585
00:50:42,760 --> 00:50:44,080
-And then went to get the car.
-Yes.

586
00:50:44,360 --> 00:50:47,080
Father ordered me to get the car again, oh my.

587
00:50:47,320 --> 00:50:48,400
He's a runner.

588
00:50:48,400 --> 00:50:52,040
-The runner.
-The storyteller. Always moving.

589
00:50:52,440 --> 00:50:55,560
-Was the previous scene easy?
-Kaewta is probably the main cause of the story.

590
00:50:55,560 --> 00:50:57,800
-Yes, Kaewta.
-It was fun.

591
00:50:59,520 --> 00:51:03,480
You don't have to dress up too meticulously for someone else's party.

592
00:51:04,080 --> 00:51:05,800
You're a guest, not the host.

593
00:51:25,400 --> 00:51:27,560
Mmm-hmm.

594
00:51:29,120 --> 00:51:32,840
-Take a picture for me.
-Why dress so meticulously for someone else's party?

595
00:51:33,880 --> 00:51:35,720
It's not your own event, understand?

596
00:51:49,040 --> 00:51:50,960
[Can he compete with you?
I saw you dancing together.]

597
00:51:51,040 --> 00:51:53,920
Oh, no, no. I concede to Babe.

598
00:51:54,040 --> 00:51:56,400
He is all dressed up today.

599
00:51:58,800 --> 00:52:01,120
-Are you cold?
-Not cold, but not hot.

600
00:52:01,120 --> 00:52:02,160
Not hot?

601
00:52:02,320 --> 00:52:04,760
-**%^&**
-I can't hear you.

602
00:52:07,240 --> 00:52:09,480
Who killed Araya?

603
00:52:09,720 --> 00:52:10,840
Be careful not to be deceived.

604
00:52:11,120 --> 00:52:12,600
-Payoon...
-Huh?

605
00:52:12,600 --> 00:52:13,720
...didn't kill her.

606
00:52:14,120 --> 00:52:14,680
What about Babe?

607
00:52:15,360 --> 00:52:16,240
He didn't kill her either.

608
00:52:16,560 --> 00:52:17,680
I like you.
