What should I do to be free from it, Luangta?

8
00:00:18,120 --> 00:00:19,280
Atone for one’s sins.

9
00:00:19,360 --> 00:00:21,880
No, I don’t want that.

10
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:27,160
Go back before it’s too late.

11
00:00:29,720 --> 00:00:30,520
Stop!

12
00:00:31,360 --> 00:00:33,160
You remember me now, don’t you?

13
00:00:33,560 --> 00:00:35,360
No, not yet.

14
00:00:35,640 --> 00:00:38,080
Give it to Kaew, in case he wants to find out.

15
00:00:38,080 --> 00:00:40,440
But he’ll have only one hour.

16
00:00:44,160 --> 00:00:45,960
Isn’t that Lady Chuichai, sir?

17
00:00:46,400 --> 00:00:47,200
Kaewta.

18
00:00:51,120 --> 00:00:53,000
Where are those two?

19
00:01:02,440 --> 00:01:03,760
Khun Phra Nai.

20
00:01:05,680 --> 00:01:06,760
Kaewta.

21
00:01:39,680 --> 00:01:41,400
They both look pretty, Miss.

22
00:01:41,840 --> 00:01:43,440
Let’s ask my brother.

23
00:01:43,960 --> 00:01:44,759
Brother…

24
00:01:45,200 --> 00:01:47,400
Oh…Brother?

25
00:01:49,240 --> 00:01:50,600
Som, where’s he?

26
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:52,560
Khun Phra Nai!

27
00:01:52,560 --> 00:01:54,160
Khun Phra Nai!

28
00:01:54,160 --> 00:01:55,160
Som!

29
00:01:56,160 --> 00:01:58,080
I was helping you choosing the accessories.

30
00:01:58,080 --> 00:02:00,280
How would I know, Miss?

31
00:02:05,600 --> 00:02:06,480
Go find him then.

32
00:02:06,640 --> 00:02:07,880
Yes, Miss.

47
00:04:26,920 --> 00:04:27,880
Good evening.

48
00:04:29,120 --> 00:04:30,600
Are you waiting for anyone?

49
00:04:32,680 --> 00:04:37,800
It’s Kan and Ruedee. We’ll float our krathong together.

50
00:04:38,040 --> 00:04:40,720
- I see.
- Oh, Khun Kaewta!

51
00:04:40,960 --> 00:04:43,840
What a coincidence.

52
00:04:47,200 --> 00:04:49,200
I’m here to see my friends.

53
00:04:50,240 --> 00:04:53,800
How nice. You already have someone to float a krathong with.

54
00:04:54,280 --> 00:04:58,280
But poor Khun Yai though.
He still couldn’t find anyone to do it with.

55
00:04:59,920 --> 00:05:00,840
What are you babbling about?

56
00:05:01,200 --> 00:05:02,920
Isn’t it true, sir?

57
00:05:03,280 --> 00:05:05,320
I’m afraid you’ll have to do it alone…

58
00:05:05,320 --> 00:05:07,480
since I have to go pay respect to the abbot.

59
00:05:09,840 --> 00:05:11,200
I’ve already made an appointment.

60
00:05:11,880 --> 00:05:16,680
Khun Kaew, can you please take him with you to float the krathong?

61
00:05:17,840 --> 00:05:18,880
Saen!

62
00:05:19,520 --> 00:05:21,640
I thought you said you wanted to do it.

63
00:05:22,080 --> 00:05:25,000
Please enjoy floating, sir.

64
00:05:25,600 --> 00:05:26,680
I’m going.

65
00:05:26,760 --> 00:05:27,760
Saen!

66
00:05:28,160 --> 00:05:29,280
Saen…

67
00:05:47,600 --> 00:05:51,880
You don’t have to do it if you don’t want to. Please go and have fun with your friends.

68
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:54,280
I can do it alone.

69
00:05:55,960 --> 00:05:57,040
Please wait.

70
00:06:05,920 --> 00:06:07,320
This was please.

71
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:21,800
Oh, you’re done shopping, Miss?

72
00:06:22,400 --> 00:06:23,800
Saen, where’s my brother?

73
00:06:25,120 --> 00:06:27,640
Khun Phra Nai has an appointment with the abbot.

74
00:06:27,960 --> 00:06:29,480
He said he has some matters to discuss with him.

75
00:06:30,480 --> 00:06:31,280
Is that so?

76
00:06:31,920 --> 00:06:32,720
Yes, Miss.

77
00:06:33,040 --> 00:06:35,280
But if you wish to float the krathong,

78
00:06:35,360 --> 00:06:37,159
Khun Phra Nai already has it prepared for you, Miss.

79
00:06:37,440 --> 00:06:39,000
This one is for you, Lady Sophee.

80
00:06:40,600 --> 00:06:42,560
And this one is for Khun Phra Nai.

81
00:06:46,440 --> 00:06:49,240
Let’s have a seat and wait here for a while, Miss.

82
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:51,000
Please.

83
00:06:52,520 --> 00:06:54,280
-  Give me two cups of tea.
- Yes, sir.

84
00:06:58,960 --> 00:07:00,600
So pretty, Miss.

85
00:07:01,960 --> 00:07:05,640
Pay respect to the abbot? I bet it’s just an excuse to see the girl.

86
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:08,840
I must apologize for him for causing you such trouble.

87
00:07:10,440 --> 00:07:11,560
Not at all, sir.

88
00:07:12,120 --> 00:07:14,960
I also told my friends to meet up here.

89
00:07:15,360 --> 00:07:17,320
But I’m afraid I must have just missed them.

90
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:31,520
Is this krathong pretty?

91
00:07:35,480 --> 00:07:36,360
Yes, it is.

92
00:07:42,280 --> 00:07:43,640
Where on earth are Kan and Ruedee?

93
00:07:43,720 --> 00:07:45,720
What about this one, is it pretty?

94
00:07:50,840 --> 00:07:52,080
Yes, it is.

95
00:07:54,960 --> 00:07:56,640
Which one is prettier?

96
00:07:58,600 --> 00:07:59,920
This one.

97
00:08:02,040 --> 00:08:04,640
Then, this one is for you.

98
00:08:11,440 --> 00:08:12,760
Thank you.

99
00:08:13,960 --> 00:08:15,480
Let’s float them together.

100
00:08:43,120 --> 00:08:43,919
Isn’t that…

101
00:08:45,040 --> 00:08:46,920
Chao Meun Samur Jairatch.

102
00:08:48,160 --> 00:08:49,800
So handsome.

103
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:52,200
Yes. Let’s go.

104
00:09:31,920 --> 00:09:33,840
I haven’t done this for a while.

105
00:09:34,400 --> 00:09:37,000
Thank you for doing it with me.

106
00:09:40,480 --> 00:09:42,800
If our krathongs keep floating side by side like this,

107
00:09:43,320 --> 00:09:48,320
they say it means we’d be long-lasting lovers.

108
00:09:49,360 --> 00:09:51,120
Have you ever heard of it?

109
00:09:52,160 --> 00:09:54,040
Never heard of it, sir.

110
00:09:56,440 --> 00:09:59,400
It’s not unusual for our krathongs to be drifting side by side…

111
00:10:00,840 --> 00:10:02,640
since we’ve released them from the same spot.

112
00:10:03,840 --> 00:10:07,400
I like it when you refer to us as ‘we’.

113
00:10:24,480 --> 00:10:25,600
What are you looking at?

114
00:10:27,120 --> 00:10:28,320
Can’t I look?

115
00:10:36,240 --> 00:10:37,920
What’s so interesting to look at?

116
00:10:39,160 --> 00:10:41,920
I’m also a man like you, Khun Yai.

117
00:10:42,600 --> 00:10:45,200
Not a lady with a face so pretty to look at.

118
00:10:50,560 --> 00:10:51,640
You’re right.

119
00:10:52,280 --> 00:10:57,600
You and I are both men.

120
00:11:13,760 --> 00:11:17,120
That’s right, there’s a stall selling candied jujube over there.

121
00:11:20,840 --> 00:11:22,040
Do you want to eat it?

122
00:11:26,120 --> 00:11:27,240
Are you thirsty, Som?

123
00:11:27,360 --> 00:11:28,840
Geez, you brat.

124
00:11:31,160 --> 00:11:32,240
Why is he taking so long?

125
00:11:33,200 --> 00:11:34,520
Would you like more tea, Miss?

126
00:11:34,680 --> 00:11:35,800
Give me one more.

127
00:11:37,600 --> 00:11:38,840
One more.

128
00:11:38,920 --> 00:11:40,000
Yes, sir.

129
00:11:52,200 --> 00:11:56,240
Chao Meun Samur Jairatch is so handsome, isn’t he?

130
00:11:57,880 --> 00:12:00,280
The one next to him is also good looking.

131
00:12:04,560 --> 00:12:05,480
Wait.

132
00:12:06,640 --> 00:12:09,880
Are you girls talking about Chao Meun Samur Jairatch?

133
00:12:10,880 --> 00:12:13,760
Yes, he surely looks so fine as rumour has it.

134
00:12:15,600 --> 00:12:17,240
Where is Chao Meun Samur Jairatch?

135
00:12:19,400 --> 00:12:20,800
Over there, Miss.

136
00:12:28,800 --> 00:12:30,080
Som, let’s go!

137
00:12:30,160 --> 00:12:31,120
Yes, Miss.

138
00:12:31,600 --> 00:12:32,640
Wait for me too.

139
00:12:33,960 --> 00:12:36,240
- I’ll pay you later.
- Yes.

140
00:12:40,960 --> 00:12:41,960
Just a second.

141
00:12:42,320 --> 00:12:43,440
Let me.

142
00:12:50,440 --> 00:12:53,760
Here. Please try it, Khun Yai.

143
00:13:11,240 --> 00:13:16,040
Hmm, so good.

144
00:13:18,240 --> 00:13:20,720
Have you never tried it before?

145
00:13:26,280 --> 00:13:27,080
No.

146
00:13:31,280 --> 00:13:32,320
What’s so funny?

147
00:13:33,440 --> 00:13:35,680
It’s funny you’ve never had candied jujube before.

148
00:13:36,640 --> 00:13:38,000
I’ve never met anyone who hasn’t.

149
00:13:42,240 --> 00:13:43,200
Kaew!

150
00:13:44,680 --> 00:13:45,960
Oh, Ruedee.

151
00:13:45,960 --> 00:13:46,960
Kan.

152
00:13:50,760 --> 00:13:52,480
Good evening, Khun Phra Nai.

153
00:13:54,640 --> 00:13:56,640
I’ve been looking for you everywhere.

154
00:13:57,360 --> 00:14:01,120
How come you’re with Khun Phra Nai?

155
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:02,880
Well…

156
00:14:03,320 --> 00:14:04,840
We met by chance.

157
00:14:05,520 --> 00:14:11,280
I never thought someone like you’d be interested to hang around in this kind of place.

158
00:14:13,320 --> 00:14:16,960
Why? Why can’t someone like me come to this place?

159
00:14:17,200 --> 00:14:21,800
Well, it’s just a small festival at the temple. I’m surprised, that’s all.

160
00:14:23,280 --> 00:14:28,200
Don’t be. If other people can do it, so can I.

161
00:14:28,200 --> 00:14:29,800
I’m also human.

162
00:14:47,440 --> 00:14:50,720
Kaew, there’s a show performing over there.

163
00:14:51,360 --> 00:14:52,440
Shall we go see it?

164
00:14:53,520 --> 00:14:54,680
Really?

165
00:14:54,680 --> 00:14:56,000
- Yes.
 - Let’s go then.

166
00:14:58,400 --> 00:15:01,760
Please excuse me and my friends then.

167
00:15:08,240 --> 00:15:09,440
Goodbye, Khun Phra Nai.

168
00:15:09,600 --> 00:15:10,400
Goodbye.

169
00:15:11,560 --> 00:15:12,360
Let’s go.

170
00:15:12,480 --> 00:15:16,120
Let’s go, Kan. Come, Kaew.

171
00:15:20,120 --> 00:15:21,720
Brother!

172
00:15:24,200 --> 00:15:25,000
Sophee.

173
00:15:25,480 --> 00:15:27,040
What are you doing here?

174
00:15:27,560 --> 00:15:29,720
Well…I…

175
00:15:29,960 --> 00:15:33,880
Have you found the candied jujube, sir?

176
00:15:34,160 --> 00:15:36,000
You’ve been craving for it since yesterday.

177
00:15:36,800 --> 00:15:37,600
That’s right.

178
00:15:38,640 --> 00:15:41,800
But earlier, I saw you talking with someone here.

179
00:15:44,120 --> 00:15:47,520
Oh, that’s the dancer from Uncle’s place.

180
00:15:48,160 --> 00:15:53,720
I accidentally ran into her, so I asked her to tell Uncle I’ll go see him tomorrow.

181
00:15:54,160 --> 00:15:55,000
It’s nothing important.

182
00:15:55,840 --> 00:15:56,960
Is that so?

183
00:16:00,480 --> 00:16:02,000
Enough with the coughing.

184
00:16:09,840 --> 00:16:13,280
Geez, my soul almost left the body.

185
00:16:13,360 --> 00:16:15,640
Fortunately, Lady Sophee didn’t question you any further.

186
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:26,080
Are you listening to what I’m saying, sir?

187
00:16:28,760 --> 00:16:29,960
Why should I?

188
00:16:30,440 --> 00:16:32,520
Things went well after all.

189
00:16:33,080 --> 00:16:38,880
I also don’t see why I must hide when I’m spending time with Kaewta.

190
00:16:39,800 --> 00:16:41,120
Now, you can say it.

191
00:16:44,120 --> 00:16:48,760
Does this mean you will no longer refrain your feelings for Lady Chuichai, Khun Yai?

192
00:17:29,280 --> 00:17:30,520
Damn you.

193
00:17:32,760 --> 00:17:34,360
Why would you think of him?

194
00:17:38,240 --> 00:17:40,800
Don’t you ever think about it, Kaew.

195
00:18:29,640 --> 00:18:31,440
What’s so interesting to look at?

196
00:18:32,560 --> 00:18:35,440
I’m also a man like you, Khun Yai.

197
00:18:36,040 --> 00:18:38,560
Not a lady with a face so pretty to look at.

198
00:18:45,600 --> 00:18:47,280
Any update?

199
00:18:47,360 --> 00:18:50,760
Not yet, sir. I’ll try to find out as soon as possible.

200
00:18:51,440 --> 00:18:54,680
You’d better hurry up. If they start to make a move, we could be in trouble.

201
00:18:56,480 --> 00:18:57,280
Yes, sir.

202
00:19:00,520 --> 00:19:02,920
Khun Phra Nai has already left for work, Miss.

203
00:19:08,960 --> 00:19:11,400
Have you prepared it as I said, Som?

204
00:19:12,280 --> 00:19:14,120
Everything, Miss.

205
00:19:46,440 --> 00:19:48,640
Isn’t that a servant from Chao Phraya Narubodin’s place?

206
00:19:50,280 --> 00:19:51,920
What the heck are they all doing here?

207
00:19:54,840 --> 00:19:58,400
Lately, I’ve heard quite nasty rumours.

208
00:19:59,880 --> 00:20:02,000
About those who are over ambitious, sir?

209
00:20:03,080 --> 00:20:05,200
Yes, you also know about it?

210
00:20:07,040 --> 00:20:10,120
I heard they are mostly young soldiers…

211
00:20:10,400 --> 00:20:13,280
who are not quite satisfied, and want to make a change.

212
00:20:14,040 --> 00:20:18,280
Those rascals! No matter how good their commander treats them,

213
00:20:18,280 --> 00:20:22,760
these ungrateful brats will always find excuses…

214
00:20:22,760 --> 00:20:27,520
and justifications for themselves to seize power.

215
00:20:29,040 --> 00:20:30,720
Please don’t worry, Uncle.

216
00:20:30,920 --> 00:20:33,080
The Royal Guard Regiment is also not at ease.

217
00:20:33,440 --> 00:20:36,120
We’re trying to find a way to spy on them…

218
00:20:36,400 --> 00:20:38,360
to get evidence and have them arrested.

219
00:20:38,800 --> 00:20:43,400
Good. Traitors should be destroyed at any cost.

220
00:20:44,360 --> 00:20:45,160
Yes, sir.

221
00:20:45,680 --> 00:20:49,400
I shall never trouble His Majesty with such a dispute even for the slightest bit.

222
00:20:49,960 --> 00:20:53,800
I’m quite relieved to hear that.

223
00:20:54,400 --> 00:20:56,960
My only concern is His Majesty.

224
00:21:07,240 --> 00:21:08,600
Your snacks, Uncle.

225
00:21:12,120 --> 00:21:15,640
If there’s nothing else, I’d like to go home to look after my mother.

226
00:21:16,360 --> 00:21:17,280
Go on.

227
00:21:18,320 --> 00:21:19,360
Goodbye, sir.

228
00:21:27,600 --> 00:21:28,800
Khun Yai!

229
00:21:30,600 --> 00:21:32,760
Are you perhaps interested in Kaew?

230
00:21:34,880 --> 00:21:36,480
I wasn’t looking at Kaew, sir.

231
00:21:36,920 --> 00:21:40,880
I was looking at…at Saen.

232
00:21:41,800 --> 00:21:42,680
Really?

233
00:21:44,280 --> 00:21:49,240
Earlier, I saw how your eyes kept tracing on him, so much you almost twisted your neck.

234
00:21:52,520 --> 00:21:57,400
It’s not like that at all. I think you’re misunderstanding something, Uncle.

235
00:21:59,360 --> 00:22:04,800
Son, you might be able to fool anyone,

236
00:22:04,800 --> 00:22:07,320
but you can’t fool your own heart.

237
00:22:08,800 --> 00:22:10,240
I…

238
00:22:12,280 --> 00:22:13,920
I might not have a wife,

239
00:22:14,760 --> 00:22:20,080
but that doesn’t mean I won’t understand anything about love.

240
00:22:21,400 --> 00:22:24,600
Love? You call it love, Uncle?

241
00:22:25,120 --> 00:22:30,200
Why? Or do you only call it ‘love’ when it’s between man and woman?

242
00:22:31,200 --> 00:22:34,720
What a waste graduating from abroad.

243
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:39,760
I thought you’d be more open-minded.

244
00:22:43,800 --> 00:22:44,880
Listen, son.

245
00:22:45,920 --> 00:22:51,320
Love…as long as it’s not unfaithful…

246
00:22:51,920 --> 00:22:55,480
or doesn’t hurt anyone,

247
00:22:56,400 --> 00:22:59,200
is never right or wrong.

248
00:22:59,920 --> 00:23:04,720
People make all the rules and conditions, that love should be like this or like that.

249
00:23:04,720 --> 00:23:06,280
All just to satisfy themselves.

250
00:23:08,240 --> 00:23:09,040
Uncle.

251
00:23:09,440 --> 00:23:16,760
Whether between men or women, if they have feelings for each other—isn't that also love?

252
00:23:21,560 --> 00:23:23,600
You are certainly right, Uncle.

253
00:23:25,600 --> 00:23:28,360
It’s us who set up all those rules.

254
00:23:30,440 --> 00:23:31,880
Thank you very much,

255
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:33,560
for your kind words of advice.

256
00:23:35,760 --> 00:23:38,800
I’d be taking my leave then.

257
00:23:41,800 --> 00:23:43,320
Where are you going, Khun Yai?

258
00:23:43,960 --> 00:23:45,640
To find my love, Saen.

259
00:24:01,880 --> 00:24:03,160
Khun Yai.

260
00:24:04,240 --> 00:24:08,360
Don’t you think it’s a little too much rushing to see him at his place like this?

261
00:24:09,120 --> 00:24:11,080
Too much or not, I couldn't care less.

262
00:24:11,080 --> 00:24:13,000
But at this moment,

263
00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:17,360
not seeing Kaewta for just one day feels like months to me.

264
00:24:18,160 --> 00:24:21,480
Wouldn’t a few days feel like a year then?

265
00:24:22,520 --> 00:24:25,880
You’ve fallen head over heels for him, Khun Yai.

266
00:24:26,480 --> 00:24:27,640
Should I worry about it?

267
00:24:29,080 --> 00:24:35,840
Of course, we still don't know how Khun Kaewta feels about you.

268
00:24:36,640 --> 00:24:39,680
That’s why I have to talk to him now.

269
00:24:42,480 --> 00:24:48,320
This is exactly why they said a burning desire can never truly be extinguished.

270
00:24:48,600 --> 00:24:53,760
Like a bird flying against the storm. Not even the strongest wind can stop it.

271
00:24:56,680 --> 00:24:57,920
Who said that?

272
00:24:58,280 --> 00:24:59,680
I’ve never heard of it.

273
00:25:00,480 --> 00:25:01,720
It’s me, sir.

274
00:25:01,960 --> 00:25:03,320
It was my saying.

275
00:25:09,960 --> 00:25:15,920
Anyway, I need you to take care of something important for me first.

276
00:25:19,240 --> 00:25:22,600
Don’t worry, I’ll make sure it’s taken care of.

277
00:26:17,360 --> 00:26:18,960
Where have they gone?

278
00:26:24,920 --> 00:26:25,800
Saen!

279
00:26:25,800 --> 00:26:26,960
Yes, it’s me.

280
00:26:27,280 --> 00:26:29,080
Please let me go.

281
00:26:29,360 --> 00:26:31,400
Go and tell your Lady Sophee…

282
00:26:31,400 --> 00:26:34,320
that if she wants to know Khun Phra Nai’s whereabouts, no need to send someone to spy on us

283
00:26:34,840 --> 00:26:36,720
Just ask him directly.

284
00:26:37,280 --> 00:26:38,080
Do you get it?

285
00:26:38,240 --> 00:26:38,920
Do you?!

286
00:26:39,200 --> 00:26:40,080
Yes!

287
00:26:40,240 --> 00:26:42,240
Go!

288
00:26:47,840 --> 00:26:49,840
He’s already taken care of, sir.

289
00:26:50,400 --> 00:26:51,200
Good.

290
00:27:16,760 --> 00:27:20,400
Will he know it was just an excuse?

291
00:27:21,640 --> 00:27:23,720
Will he think I'm trying to avoid him?

292
00:27:36,320 --> 00:27:39,120
Geez, are you crazy?

293
00:27:39,760 --> 00:27:42,120
Why would you keep thinking about him?

294
00:27:44,400 --> 00:27:45,200
Kaew.

295
00:27:51,480 --> 00:27:53,440
You even came all the way here, Khun Yai?

296
00:27:54,800 --> 00:27:55,960
Yes.

297
00:28:08,160 --> 00:28:09,840
I’ve been looking for you everywhere.

298
00:28:11,920 --> 00:28:14,200
Why would you look for me?

299
00:28:14,200 --> 00:28:19,600
You already heard me telling Uncle that I had to come home to look after my mother.

300
00:28:22,120 --> 00:28:23,880
Wasn't that because you wanted to avoid me?

301
00:28:24,600 --> 00:28:29,640
Avoid you? I think you’ve got it wrong.

302
00:28:30,240 --> 00:28:33,440
Then, why did you suddenly leave when you saw me visiting there?

303
00:28:34,720 --> 00:28:39,960
As far as I know, weren't you there to discuss business matters with Uncle?

304
00:28:40,880 --> 00:28:41,840
That’s correct.

305
00:28:42,920 --> 00:28:46,640
But don't you know I could also use that as an excuse to see you?

306
00:28:48,600 --> 00:28:49,600
No, sir.

307
00:28:49,960 --> 00:28:52,640
And I also don’t want to know it.

308
00:28:59,520 --> 00:29:01,120
Are you mad at me?

309
00:29:03,160 --> 00:29:07,360
Khun Yai, this is my house.

310
00:29:08,680 --> 00:29:11,440
Please move over. It’s inappropriate.

311
00:29:20,480 --> 00:29:21,680
Mat at you?

312
00:29:24,280 --> 00:29:29,600
Do you think you know me well enough to say that kind of thing?

313
00:29:31,000 --> 00:29:32,880
It’s because I still don’t,

314
00:29:33,360 --> 00:29:35,400
that’s why I’d like you to give me a chance.

315
00:29:36,200 --> 00:29:39,640
Will you please allow me to get to know you more, Kaewta?

316
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:43,240
What for?

317
00:29:44,880 --> 00:29:47,200
So that I…

318
00:29:48,600 --> 00:29:49,920
- Miss Payom!
 - Mum!

319
00:29:55,960 --> 00:30:00,320
What? You got exposed by Khun Yai and Saen?

320
00:30:02,360 --> 00:30:05,320
All I’ve asked is for you to keep track of his whereabouts. But you still failed.

321
00:30:05,320 --> 00:30:07,200
Perhaps this is not what you’re good at.

322
00:30:07,440 --> 00:30:09,200
I’m so sorry, Miss.

323
00:30:09,920 --> 00:30:13,200
So, what did you say when you got caught?

324
00:30:14,480 --> 00:30:18,120
Khun Phra Nai didn’t speak to me directly.

325
00:30:18,720 --> 00:30:26,000
But he told Saen to relay his message to you, that if you ever want to know anything about him,

326
00:30:26,360 --> 00:30:28,160
you can just ask him directly...

327
00:30:29,000 --> 00:30:30,560
and that you should never do this again, Miss.

328
00:30:32,040 --> 00:30:36,200
Saen, that brat! You’re also useless!

329
00:30:38,040 --> 00:30:41,520
Miss, you should punish him so that he won’t fail again.

330
00:30:42,200 --> 00:30:43,640
You can’t even get an easy job done.

331
00:30:43,960 --> 00:30:47,200
How could we trust you to handle anything next time?

332
00:30:49,200 --> 00:30:50,200
You can go now.

333
00:30:51,280 --> 00:30:53,160
Yes, sir. Thank you, Miss.

334
00:30:54,400 --> 00:30:55,960
But Miss,

335
00:30:57,200 --> 00:30:59,920
Are you really not going to punish him?

336
00:31:00,400 --> 00:31:03,240
What good would I get from punishing someone like that?

337
00:31:04,840 --> 00:31:07,480
That’s odd. Why is she so kind today?

338
00:31:08,040 --> 00:31:09,760
But you were right, Som.

339
00:31:09,760 --> 00:31:13,760
If he can’t even get such an easy job done, how could I trust him to do anything in the future?

340
00:31:14,480 --> 00:31:20,600
That’s why the one who should be punished…is you.

341
00:31:20,600 --> 00:31:22,440
Pong! Do it.

342
00:31:25,240 --> 00:31:26,040
Yes, Miss.

343
00:31:27,200 --> 00:31:29,120
I’ve been waiting for this day, Bitch!

344
00:31:39,800 --> 00:31:40,680
Careful, Mum.

345
00:31:40,880 --> 00:31:42,800
Yes, yes. Thank you, dear.

346
00:31:48,440 --> 00:31:50,960
Thank you so much for helping me, Yai.

347
00:31:53,440 --> 00:31:57,760
Really, I’m fine, dear.

348
00:31:58,400 --> 00:32:02,800
No, you’re not. You just fainted.

349
00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:05,440
I’ll be fine soon.

350
00:32:07,800 --> 00:32:13,240
You too, Yai. Why did you tell Saen to go get the doctor?

351
00:32:14,120 --> 00:32:14,960
Don’t worry about it.

352
00:32:20,400 --> 00:32:21,760
There they are.

353
00:32:22,520 --> 00:32:23,720
We’re here, sir.

354
00:32:30,560 --> 00:32:31,480
This way, please.

355
00:32:34,600 --> 00:32:35,480
Hello.

356
00:32:37,280 --> 00:32:38,520
Hello.

357
00:32:49,280 --> 00:32:50,480
How’s she doing?

358
00:32:51,000 --> 00:32:56,560
I think we’ll get her some medicine, and she should be fine again in a few days.

359
00:32:57,200 --> 00:33:00,280
So, I’ll order her some medicine.

360
00:33:00,280 --> 00:33:01,000
Okay, sure.

361
00:33:01,400 --> 00:33:04,840
Saen, go with the doctor to drop him off and get the medicine.

362
00:33:05,160 --> 00:33:05,960
Yes, sir.

363
00:33:06,080 --> 00:33:07,320
This way, please.

364
00:33:07,520 --> 00:33:09,280
Goodbye.

365
00:33:09,520 --> 00:33:10,320
Goodbye.

366
00:33:10,440 --> 00:33:11,520
Thank you, Doctor.

367
00:33:12,360 --> 00:33:13,160
This way, please.

368
00:33:23,040 --> 00:33:26,640
Thank you so much for your help, Yai.

369
00:33:29,600 --> 00:33:33,560
By the way, what do you do for a living?

370
00:33:33,560 --> 00:33:35,680
How did you and Kaew know each other?

371
00:33:40,680 --> 00:33:47,800
Mum, Khun Yai is Khun Phra Nai or Chao Meun Samur Jairatch.

372
00:33:48,480 --> 00:33:51,920
Chao Meun Samur Jairatch…the royal guard?

373
00:33:54,520 --> 00:33:55,640
Please don’t do that.

374
00:33:56,440 --> 00:33:59,120
I often have business matters to discuss with Luang Sanor.

375
00:33:59,600 --> 00:34:01,160
That’s how I’ve come to know Kaewta.

376
00:34:01,160 --> 00:34:02,840
I see.

377
00:34:16,639 --> 00:34:20,239
Thank you for your kind help, Khun Yai.

378
00:34:22,159 --> 00:34:24,440
I’ll pay you back as soon as I can.

379
00:34:25,239 --> 00:34:29,159
I don’t want it. I helped you because I wanted to.

380
00:34:39,600 --> 00:34:40,960
You don’t have to do that.

381
00:34:44,480 --> 00:34:46,199
Thank you, Khun Yai.

382
00:34:50,280 --> 00:34:53,440
I’ll come to check on your mother every day until she gets better.

383
00:34:54,040 --> 00:34:56,639
Please don’t. It’s inappropriate.

384
00:34:57,080 --> 00:34:58,360
How inappropriate?

385
00:34:59,800 --> 00:35:04,440
A nobleman like you coming to visit a house of a lowly dancer,

386
00:35:04,880 --> 00:35:07,520
other people might be talking badly about it.

387
00:35:10,000 --> 00:35:15,280
Noble or lowly, appropriate or not– it’s up to me to decide.

388
00:35:15,640 --> 00:35:17,360
I don’t care what other people would say.

389
00:35:18,000 --> 00:35:18,720
But…

390
00:35:18,720 --> 00:35:20,520
I’m honestly worried about your mother.

391
00:35:21,320 --> 00:35:25,480
Please let me make sure she’s fully recovered.

392
00:35:27,320 --> 00:35:28,120
Fine.

393
00:35:30,960 --> 00:35:35,560
I’d better get going then. Go on in to look after your mother.

394
00:35:41,960 --> 00:35:43,400
Let’s go.

395
00:35:43,440 --> 00:35:44,240
Yes, sir.

396
00:35:58,320 --> 00:35:59,280
How dare you!

397
00:35:59,400 --> 00:36:00,200
Give me that!

398
00:36:00,200 --> 00:36:03,000
No! You give me that! How dare you!

399
00:36:03,120 --> 00:36:04,480
Why wouldn't I?

400
00:36:04,880 --> 00:36:06,360
- Give it to me now!
- Stop!

401
00:36:06,760 --> 00:36:08,120
That’s enough!

402
00:36:08,200 --> 00:36:09,920
Stop right now, both of you! Stop!

403
00:36:16,720 --> 00:36:18,000
You should stop, my dear sister.

404
00:36:19,280 --> 00:36:23,600
If you keep punishing them like this, I'm afraid they might be crippled soon.

405
00:36:28,960 --> 00:36:32,400
I don’t see any difference if these useless maggots were to turn a cripple.

406
00:36:35,080 --> 00:36:40,480
True that. But where else will you find a servant like Som who knows exactly what you’re thinking?

407
00:36:42,800 --> 00:36:45,080
You’re absolutely right, Master Prom.

408
00:36:45,560 --> 00:36:49,120
‘Don’t put the wrong man on the wrong job.’-- Do you remember, Som?

409
00:36:49,120 --> 00:36:50,800
You taught me that yourself.

410
00:36:51,560 --> 00:36:58,000
Yes, Miss. I’ll be more careful next time, I promise.

411
00:36:58,000 --> 00:36:58,880
Waste of time.

412
00:37:01,360 --> 00:37:03,640
Thank you so much, Master Prom.

413
00:37:07,320 --> 00:37:08,600
What the heck are you looking at?

414
00:37:17,880 --> 00:37:20,720
Miss, Khun Phra Nai is back.

415
00:37:28,480 --> 00:37:30,120
What is it, Prom?

416
00:37:52,960 --> 00:37:57,520
Who are they? Why are they plotting against the royal court?

417
00:37:59,600 --> 00:38:03,200
Based on my information so far, they are probably the Young Turks.

418
00:38:03,600 --> 00:38:06,000
This group of citizens is eager for a change.

419
00:38:07,680 --> 00:38:09,240
A change?

420
00:38:10,800 --> 00:38:12,880
These new-generation people are still inexperienced.

421
00:38:13,840 --> 00:38:17,240
They often believe that change is always a good thing.

422
00:38:19,240 --> 00:38:25,080
But a change made foolishly is like setting up a fire to your own house.

423
00:38:26,640 --> 00:38:28,760
You are absolutely right, Father.

424
00:38:29,480 --> 00:38:32,000
A big tree can stand tall because of its deep roots.

425
00:38:33,200 --> 00:38:36,160
Not because it keeps swaying every time the wind blows.

426
00:38:40,280 --> 00:38:41,560
The world could change…

427
00:38:42,600 --> 00:38:46,400
but morals and goodness should always remain in your heart.

428
00:38:48,000 --> 00:38:49,200
Remember that.

429
00:38:50,080 --> 00:38:51,800
Yes, Father.

430
00:38:55,640 --> 00:39:00,000
Don’t let anyone know what we talked about today.

431
00:39:01,400 --> 00:39:03,640
Whatever you do, always keep it confidential.

432
00:39:04,800 --> 00:39:07,080
It’s for your own safety too, son.

433
00:39:07,960 --> 00:39:09,400
Yes, Father.

434
00:39:11,920 --> 00:39:13,400
Please excuse me then.

435
00:39:22,200 --> 00:39:25,760
Father doesn’t need to see a son of his own blood and flesh every single day.

436
00:39:27,840 --> 00:39:29,240
What is it, Prom?

437
00:39:30,200 --> 00:39:31,080
Nothing.

438
00:39:34,440 --> 00:39:35,240
Brother.

439
00:39:37,000 --> 00:39:38,480
- Let’s go, Boon.
- Yes, sir.

440
00:39:45,160 --> 00:39:47,240
Please don’t mind him.

441
00:39:49,120 --> 00:39:53,160
I’m a big brother. I can always forgive my younger siblings…

442
00:39:55,560 --> 00:39:57,520
as long as they feel sorry about it.

443
00:39:58,560 --> 00:40:00,000
I’m truly sorry.

444
00:40:01,560 --> 00:40:04,400
I saw how badly injured you were the other day and I was worried.

445
00:40:05,040 --> 00:40:07,600
So, I just sent someone to guard on you, that’s all.

446
00:40:09,280 --> 00:40:10,720
Please don’t do it again.

447
00:40:11,680 --> 00:40:15,120
This brother of yours is Chao Meun Samur Jairatch, the king’s royal guard.

448
00:40:16,000 --> 00:40:17,600
No one would dare to hurt me.

449
00:40:18,600 --> 00:40:19,840
You don’t have to worry.

450
00:40:22,040 --> 00:40:23,080
Yes.

451
00:40:47,400 --> 00:40:49,360
It’s because I still don’t know you well enough,

452
00:40:49,800 --> 00:40:52,000
that’s why I’d like you to give me a chance.

453
00:40:52,600 --> 00:40:56,160
Will you please allow me to get to know you more, Kaewta?

454
00:40:58,440 --> 00:40:59,520
Why?

455
00:41:01,280 --> 00:41:03,120
So that I…

456
00:41:04,720 --> 00:41:06,040
- Miss Payom!
- Mum!

457
00:41:12,160 --> 00:41:18,280
Why is it? I really want to know.

458
00:41:19,280 --> 00:41:21,160
It’s too late to ask him now.

459
00:41:26,960 --> 00:41:31,920
But wait, why would I want to know it?

460
00:41:42,000 --> 00:41:45,480
Kaew, why are you still up?

461
00:41:45,800 --> 00:41:48,680
I’m better now. You don’t need to stay up late to watch over me.

462
00:41:49,680 --> 00:41:51,360
I just can’t sleep, Mum.

463
00:41:53,040 --> 00:41:57,680
That’s right, I have something to ask you.

464
00:42:00,480 --> 00:42:06,880
Why did Khun Phra Nai come here to ask for you not just once but twice?

465
00:42:08,960 --> 00:42:12,480
He came to our house before?

466
00:42:13,840 --> 00:42:18,880
Yes, he came to ask for a Chuichai dancer.

467
00:42:18,880 --> 00:42:24,560
The one who performed at the prince’s palace that day.

468
00:42:24,960 --> 00:42:26,240
Is that so?

469
00:42:29,000 --> 00:42:31,040
I have no idea too, Mum.

470
00:42:32,720 --> 00:42:39,120
Kaew, I know I’ve raised you to grow up as a man with his own thoughts.

471
00:42:40,160 --> 00:42:42,280
But I’m still worried somehow.

472
00:42:46,560 --> 00:42:48,200
About what, Mum?

473
00:42:48,840 --> 00:42:50,240
About Khun Phra Nai.

474
00:42:53,640 --> 00:42:58,320
He’s a nobleman with a high ranking.

475
00:42:58,960 --> 00:43:02,040
Even though he seems to be very kind and fond of you,

476
00:43:04,560 --> 00:43:08,200
I don’t want you to get too familiar with him.

477
00:43:10,280 --> 00:43:16,160
Although Luang Sanor has agreed to take you in as his adopted son,

478
00:43:17,880 --> 00:43:20,440
you should never forget your own root.

479
00:43:21,240 --> 00:43:24,000
After all, we’re only servants, dear.

480
00:43:30,800 --> 00:43:33,880
I’ve never had that kind of thought in mind, Mum.

481
00:43:36,560 --> 00:43:37,920
I believe you.

482
00:43:40,040 --> 00:43:47,040
But I still want you to be careful. Don’t let your feelings grow too far.

483
00:43:47,560 --> 00:43:49,840
Or else you might regret it later.

484
00:43:56,160 --> 00:43:57,320
Yes, Mum.

485
00:44:16,920 --> 00:44:18,200
Som is here, sir.

486
00:44:21,840 --> 00:44:24,920
Why would you like to see me, Master?

487
00:44:25,680 --> 00:44:27,080
I want you to do something for me.

488
00:44:27,080 --> 00:44:29,520
Think of it as a favour returned for helping you earlier.

489
00:44:30,320 --> 00:44:32,720
You only have to say it, Master Prom.

490
00:44:32,720 --> 00:44:35,000
I’ll do anything for you.

491
00:44:36,960 --> 00:44:40,840
Keep an eye on that brat, I mean Khun Yai, for me.

492
00:44:44,600 --> 00:44:46,120
Khun Yai?

493
00:44:46,120 --> 00:44:46,760
Yes.

494
00:44:47,920 --> 00:44:50,880
Everything about him, report it to me.

495
00:44:51,240 --> 00:44:52,720
Can you do that?

496
00:44:55,000 --> 00:44:56,360
Yes, Master.

497
00:44:58,600 --> 00:45:00,760
Good. Let’s go, Boon.

498
00:45:03,000 --> 00:45:04,040
Please wait.

499
00:45:05,880 --> 00:45:06,680
What is it?

500
00:45:07,960 --> 00:45:10,120
I’m not sure if you’d want to know this.

501
00:45:10,680 --> 00:45:16,080
But lately, Khun Yai often goes to visit Luang Sanor’s place.

502
00:45:16,800 --> 00:45:18,600
Luang Sanor from the Bureau of Thai Classical Dance?

503
00:45:19,000 --> 00:45:20,120
Yes, Master.

504
00:45:41,560 --> 00:45:42,520
Khun Yai!

505
00:45:50,160 --> 00:45:51,880
Why are you here?

506
00:45:52,800 --> 00:45:53,600
I brought some…

507
00:45:53,600 --> 00:45:54,840
Shh!

508
00:46:01,000 --> 00:46:04,240
I brought some nourishing food for your mother.

509
00:46:07,760 --> 00:46:09,440
Please take it back.

510
00:46:13,560 --> 00:46:15,360
And don’t come here again.

511
00:46:16,720 --> 00:46:17,760
Wait.

512
00:46:18,160 --> 00:46:19,640
Is there something wrong?

513
00:46:20,320 --> 00:46:22,520
You were smiling at me when I left yesterday.

514
00:46:23,480 --> 00:46:25,400
Yesterday is gone.

515
00:46:25,880 --> 00:46:27,200
Today is what matters.

516
00:46:28,480 --> 00:46:30,160
Please go back, Khun Yai.

517
00:46:33,000 --> 00:46:36,840
Have I done anything to upset you? Please tell me.

518
00:46:39,080 --> 00:46:41,680
No, it has nothing to do with you.

519
00:46:42,000 --> 00:46:45,960
I’m rather mad at myself.

520
00:46:46,920 --> 00:46:48,280
What do you mean?

521
00:46:50,520 --> 00:46:52,240
You don’t need to know it.

522
00:46:55,160 --> 00:46:56,160
Please excuse me.

523
00:46:57,800 --> 00:46:58,720
Khun Yai!

524
00:46:59,160 --> 00:46:59,960
Khun Yai!

525
00:47:05,920 --> 00:47:06,920
What is it?

526
00:47:07,080 --> 00:47:10,680
It’s something urgent. Please go to Luang Sanor’s place right now, sir.

527
00:47:17,560 --> 00:47:18,880
I must go now.

528
00:47:18,880 --> 00:47:21,240
I have an urgent matter to discuss with Luang Sanor.

529
00:47:22,520 --> 00:47:23,720
Let’s go, Saen.

530
00:47:37,640 --> 00:47:38,920
I’m sorry, sir.

531
00:47:38,920 --> 00:47:42,320
Since Luang Sanor already knows about our plan,

532
00:47:42,320 --> 00:47:45,440
I don’t see any other way that’s better and safer than using this place.

533
00:47:47,200 --> 00:47:50,160
Luang Sanor is waiting for you, sir. This way, please.

534
00:48:12,400 --> 00:48:13,760
What is his condition so far?

535
00:48:14,640 --> 00:48:20,360
I’ve asked a trusted foreign doctor to check on him earlier.

536
00:48:21,160 --> 00:48:22,960
It’s quite serious.

537
00:48:22,960 --> 00:48:25,320
He’s still unconscious.

538
00:48:32,680 --> 00:48:35,120
Sir, Master Prom is here.

539
00:48:35,480 --> 00:48:37,960
Kan, go stall time for me.

540
00:48:38,400 --> 00:48:40,840
Tell him I’ll be there after I’m done with my business.

541
00:48:41,000 --> 00:48:41,800
Yes, sir.

542
00:48:48,160 --> 00:48:51,040
My apologies for pulling you into this mess, Uncle.

543
00:48:51,840 --> 00:48:57,040
Why would you apologise? I’m willing to do anything for our country.

544
00:48:58,520 --> 00:49:03,640
Saen told me you sent him to spy on them, is that right?

545
00:49:16,200 --> 00:49:17,000
Saen.

546
00:49:17,360 --> 00:49:18,040
Yes, sir.

547
00:49:18,040 --> 00:49:18,960
Tell him.

548
00:49:23,800 --> 00:49:26,120
Before he passed out, he said he already got the name list.

549
00:49:26,560 --> 00:49:29,480
But I don’t know where he keeps it. I’ve searched his body but couldn’t find anything.

550
00:49:31,160 --> 00:49:33,560
We’ll find out when he’s awake.

551
00:49:46,200 --> 00:49:47,080
Your drink, sir.

552
00:49:55,200 --> 00:49:56,840
Please wait a moment.

553
00:49:56,840 --> 00:49:59,040
I already told Luang Sanor you’re here.

554
00:50:03,840 --> 00:50:09,080
He got beaten up so badly. I think they might already find it suspicious somehow.

555
00:50:10,840 --> 00:50:13,240
I’m worried about his safety, Uncle.

556
00:50:14,880 --> 00:50:18,880
Don’t worry. I’ll add more guards and increase security.

557
00:50:18,880 --> 00:50:20,600
Both day and night.

558
00:50:20,840 --> 00:50:22,280
No one will be able to get in.

559
00:50:23,200 --> 00:50:24,520

It seems Chao Meun Sri Sorarak has something to tell us.

563
00:50:54,880 --> 00:50:55,680
Yes.

564
00:50:58,200 --> 00:51:00,840
Two days ago, a thief broke into this place.

565
00:51:00,880 --> 00:51:03,360
Didn’t Luang Sanor say we shouldn’t tell anyone about it?

566
00:51:03,400 --> 00:51:04,320
Prom!

567
00:51:04,520 --> 00:51:06,360
I’m worried and want to warn you.

568
00:51:06,760 --> 00:51:07,760
About what?

569
00:51:08,440 --> 00:51:11,080
Some people are deceived by ideology.

570
00:51:11,720 --> 00:51:16,040
So much that they fail to notice some paths might not lead them to glory.

571
00:51:16,040 --> 00:51:19,120
Whatever you’ll do, always think of Father and your family.

572

Khun Yai!

573
00:51:25,120 --> 00:51:25,520
Kaew!

574
00:51:25,520 --> 00:51:26,200
Kaew!

575
00:51:26,200 --> 00:51:26,960
Kaew!

576
00:51:27,120 --> 00:51:28,720
What happened, Kaew?

577
00:51:44,440 --> 00:51:46,840
Everyone is watching the BEHIND THE SCENES…

EP7!

579
00:51:48,480 --> 00:51:52,280
Oh wow, the weather is really helping Khun Phra Nai flirt with Kaewta.

580
00:51:52,520 --> 00:51:53,280
Dead silent.

581
00:51:53,280 --> 00:51:55,600
Helping how? Feels more like lightning’s about to strike.

582
00:51:56,520 --> 00:51:57,640
How are you today?

583
00:51:57,640 --> 00:52:00,000
Today? I’m totally soaked from the rain.

584
00:52:02,560 --> 00:52:04,000
Got kissed.

585
00:52:04,000 --> 00:52:05,560
Hey, I was just trying to crack a joke.

586
00:52:06,120 --> 00:52:07,240
Got one kiss on the cheek.

587
00:52:07,240 --> 00:52:09,440
Got kissed—maybe a bit too hard.

588
00:52:09,800 --> 00:52:11,680
How did I kiss you? Why is my face bruised? Just you wait.

589
00:52:11,680 --> 00:52:15,040
You got punched because you tried to take advantage of me.

590
00:52:15,040 --> 00:52:18,040
Well, you were about to do that, so I had to…

591
00:52:18,040 --> 00:52:20,960
About to do what? What is “that”?

592
00:52:20,960 --> 00:52:23,960
But the wind keeps blowing my hair into my mouth.

593
00:52:24,520 --> 00:52:28,280
For now, we’re going to grab something to eat. We don’t have much time.

594
00:52:28,280 --> 00:52:29,440
– Yeah. / – I have to go shoot again soon.

595
00:52:29,440 --> 00:52:31,280
– Yeah. / – I’ll excuse myself first.

596
00:52:31,280 --> 00:52:32,800
Please keep watching.

597
00:53:01,080 --> 00:53:02,440
Hello.

598
00:53:04,000 --> 00:53:06,240
He truly is beautiful.

599
00:53:06,520 --> 00:53:09,520
But Saen is very worried about Khun Yai right now.

600
00:53:09,520 --> 00:53:15,800
Because who knows if Khun Yai will flirt with Kaew using old-fashioned jokes again? I’m worried.

601
00:53:15,800 --> 00:53:17,400
So I rushed over to help Khun Yai.

602
00:53:18,120 --> 00:53:19,040
That last scene went well.

603
00:53:19,040 --> 00:53:23,200
I saw the fireworks being lit behind them while they were locking eyes, like they were in a trance.

604
00:53:23,200 --> 00:53:26,360
That scene was really beautiful. Like…

605
00:53:26,720 --> 00:53:31,240
You… you! You!

606
00:54:14,960 --> 00:54:16,960
– Saen. / – Yeah, it’s me.

607
00:54:18,200 --> 00:54:20,000
– Do you get it? / – I do, P’Saen.

608
00:54:20,000 --> 00:54:22,360
Get out. Go!

609
00:54:23,960 --> 00:54:26,400
Someone was tailing Khun Phra-nai earlier.

610
00:54:26,400 --> 00:54:28,520
Saen couldn’t let it slide, so he handled it.

611
00:54:28,520 --> 00:54:30,480
Who taught you to be this aggressive?

612
00:54:30,480 --> 00:54:33,640
Well, you kept walking around without noticing anything.

613
00:54:34,240 --> 00:54:36,920
He’s Alfred. I’m Batman.

614
00:54:36,920 --> 00:54:39,920
– He’ll take care of everything.
– That’s true.

615
00:54:39,920 --> 00:54:42,480
– I’ll carry it for you.
– Good.

616
00:55:12,680 --> 00:55:16,920
Damn it… why am I thinking about him?

617
00:55:18,040 --> 00:55:19,040
Kaew!

618
00:55:26,640 --> 00:55:28,640
I’ve been looking for you everywhere.

619
00:55:29,240 --> 00:55:32,520
Why did you rush back as soon as I went to see you?

620
00:55:33,240 --> 00:55:37,560
I don’t know. And there’s nothing to know anyway.

621
00:55:40,920 --> 00:55:42,640
You sound like you’re sulking at me.

622
00:55:44,040 --> 00:55:45,600
