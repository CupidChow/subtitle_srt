143

That fool has done nothing but tainted our family name. Why would I care about him?

144
00:18:47,800 --> 00:18:50,920
Let’s have dinner together before you leave, Brother.

145
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:58,520

Let’s go, Saen.

147
00:19:00,840 --> 00:19:02,000
Yes, sir.

148
00:19:10,320 --> 00:19:14,240
Why did you let him go back so easily like that, Miss?

149
00:19:14,760 --> 00:19:20,800
What if that rat tells Khun Phra Nai about what happened today, what would we do?

150
00:19:22,160 --> 00:19:25,880
Even if he finds out, he wouldn’t dare to do anything to me.

151
00:19:27,480 --> 00:19:31,600
Because if he ever mentions it to Father, it’s rather him who’d be in trouble.

152
00:19:36,160 --> 00:19:42,200
You’re right, Miss. That dancer might have run away from the white house by now.

I do hope so too.

Kaew, what happened? Why did you cut your hair?

155
00:20:22,960 --> 00:20:27,960
The weather’s been quite hot lately. I want to try wearing it short.

156
00:20:29,200 --> 00:20:32,800
Why? Does it look bad on me?

157
00:20:37,480 --> 00:20:43,320
Not at all. Whether short or long, they both look pretty on you.

158
00:20:46,640 --> 00:20:50,320
But how are you going to perform with such a short hair like that?

159
00:20:50,600 --> 00:20:53,600
That’s right. Will Uncle scold you for this?

160
00:20:55,720 --> 00:20:58,160
There hasn’t been a request for our performance lately.

161
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:00,520
I don’t think Uncle would mind that much.

162
00:21:02,280 --> 00:21:03,720
อ My hair will grow back soon.

163
00:21:07,800 --> 00:21:12,480
Actually, the short hair also looks good on you.

How’s Khun Prom?

167
00:21:33,440 --> 00:21:37,480

Then, what is it?

169
00:21:50,080 --> 00:21:53,400
There has been an order for me to go on a business trip.

170
00:22:02,360 --> 00:22:03,880
I really don’t want to go

171
00:22:05,720 --> 00:22:07,880
But it’s an order, you can’t disobey it.

172
00:22:13,280 --> 00:22:17,240
I don’t want to be away from you for even just one day.

I have been so obvious, do you still now know how I feel?

177
00:22:56,800 --> 00:23:01,760
Even so, I still want to hear it from you.

178
00:23:02,800 --> 00:23:04,680
Can’t you say it for me?

179
00:23:09,480 --> 00:23:16,120
When you come back from the trip, I will tell you.

180
00:23:17,560 --> 00:23:20,040
Really? You promise?

181
00:23:22,560 --> 00:23:27,760
That when I return from the trip, I’ll hear that word from you.

182
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:30,840
I promise.

183
00:23:32,080 --> 00:23:34,440
Now I have something to look forward to.

184
00:23:39,760 --> 00:23:41,320
But right now…

185
00:24:31,280 --> 00:24:35,320
Please take care. Don’t let yourself catch a cold.

186
00:24:38,280 --> 00:24:42,040
Khun Kaew, I’ll put them in the car first.

187
00:24:48,800 --> 00:24:49,840
Khun Yai.

188
00:24:49,840 --> 00:24:54,160
You too, dear. Take care of yourself.

189
00:24:56,520 --> 00:25:00,480
Don’t worry. Nanny Yam is also here.

190
00:25:05,520 --> 00:25:07,320
Smell so nice

191
00:25:11,880 --> 00:25:13,200
I’m leaving then.

192
00:25:13,200 --> 00:25:14,880
Have a safe trip.

193
00:25:29,600 --> 00:25:36,000
I’ve checked, Miss. It’s confirmed that Khun Phra Nai and Saen will be away for 3-4 days.

194
00:25:36,720 --> 00:25:44,640
Good. While he’s away, I’ll take this chance to get rid of those filthy things in my bridal house.

195
00:26:03,880 --> 00:26:06,000
Your letter, Khun Kaew.

196
00:26:19,200 --> 00:26:22,200
Kaew, I miss you so much.

197
00:26:22,680 --> 00:26:31,280
There are so many things I want to tell you. Please come and meet me at the place on this map. From Ruedee.

198
00:26:33,600 --> 00:26:35,640
Who is it from?

199
00:26:37,520 --> 00:26:39,720
It’s from Ruedee, Nanny.

200
00:26:40,880 --> 00:26:48,240
She said she and her husband have come to visit her family here. She wants me to go see her.

201
00:26:49,040 --> 00:26:51,360
Where will you go see her?

202
00:27:04,760 --> 00:27:08,000
Ruedee! Ruedee!

203
00:27:17,920 --> 00:27:19,240
Ruedee!

204
00:27:21,000 --> 00:27:22,680
Are you in there, Ruedee?

205
00:27:32,400 --> 00:27:34,120
Is it here?

206
00:27:41,240 --> 00:27:42,680
Ruedee!

207
00:28:16,200 --> 00:28:17,720
Ruedee!

208
00:28:30,280 --> 00:28:33,680
Who are you? Did you guys kill Ruedee?

209
00:28:34,200 --> 00:28:37,200
There’s no way she’d hang herself.

210
00:28:37,560 --> 00:28:39,240
Why did you kill her?

211
00:28:50,680 --> 00:28:53,840
You want to know?
You want to know why I killed her?

212
00:28:53,880 --> 00:28:55,320
Go ask her yourself then!

213
00:29:46,400 --> 00:29:49,400
Who told you to do this?

214
00:29:53,280 --> 00:29:55,200
Do you know Khun Phra Nai?

215
00:29:58,200 --> 00:30:03,280
Yes, it’s him. Chao Meun Samur Jairatch ordered us to do this.

216
00:30:10,360 --> 00:30:17,840
No. That’s not true. Khun Yai would never do that.

217
00:30:23,080 --> 00:30:26,080
No. Help…

218
00:30:27,520 --> 00:30:31,320
Help…Anybody, please help!

219
00:30:34,760 --> 00:30:40,720
They’re lying. Khun Yai will never do this!

220
00:30:41,400 --> 00:30:46,720
Help…Khun Yai, please help me.

221
00:30:59,280 --> 00:31:06,040
Help! Khun Yai!

222
00:31:08,520 --> 00:31:11,520
Khun Yai!

223
00:31:19,880 --> 00:31:21,040
Khun Yai!

224
00:31:21,040 --> 00:31:22,880
Are you all right, sir?

225
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:26,160
I heard Kaew calling for me.

226
00:31:26,680 --> 00:31:30,760
You must have imagined it because you miss him too much.

227
00:31:33,000 --> 00:31:34,080
No.

228
00:31:37,200 --> 00:31:39,280
I’ll ask someone to bring you a new glass.

229
00:31:56,000 --> 00:32:02,760
Good. Wait a few more days and check on him again. Make sure he’s dead then come and report me.

230
00:32:02,760 --> 00:32:03,960
Yes.

231
00:32:05,600 --> 00:32:07,680
This is your reward money from Lady Sophee.

232
00:32:08,720 --> 00:32:10,360
Reward money for what?

233
00:32:38,560 --> 00:32:43,000
Mum…Khun Yai…

234
00:32:45,280 --> 00:32:47,600
Please help me.

235
00:32:48,480 --> 00:32:50,720
Help me…

236
00:33:00,600 --> 00:33:02,840
Khun Yai…

237
00:33:06,840 --> 00:33:09,160
[Kaewta: My love…]

238
00:33:10,280 --> 00:33:16,800
[Kaewta: I’m afraid I won’t be able to keep my promise in this life.]

239
00:33:17,680 --> 00:33:22,160
Even so, I still want to hear it from you.

240
00:33:22,160 --> 00:33:28,800
When you return from the trip, I’ll tell you.

241
00:33:46,760 --> 00:33:49,320
Khun Yai…

242
00:34:21,120 --> 00:34:23,520
Kaew, I’m back.

243
00:34:27,000 --> 00:34:31,600
Father, what urgent matter has brought you here?

244
00:34:34,320 --> 00:34:37,159
Kan, why are you here too?

245
00:34:37,400 --> 00:34:40,639
Nanny! Why are you crying?

246
00:34:50,840 --> 00:34:52,360
Khun Yai…

247
00:34:53,199 --> 00:34:57,920
I tried to help, but it was too late.

248
00:34:59,000 --> 00:35:02,480
I’m sorry, son. I’m so sorry.

249
00:35:03,200 --> 00:35:04,880
Sorry about what, Father?

250
00:35:29,840 --> 00:35:31,200
Kaew.

251
00:35:32,000 --> 00:35:33,400
Kaew.

252
00:35:35,040 --> 00:35:39,600
Kaew, Kaew, Kaew…

253
00:35:41,880 --> 00:35:42,840
Kaew…

254
00:35:44,920 --> 00:35:47,520
Kaew…Kaew…

255
00:35:54,600 --> 00:35:55,880
Kaew!

256
00:36:11,120 --> 00:36:12,880
Kaew! Kaew…

257
00:36:15,040 --> 00:36:19,400
Please tell me you also feel the same.

258
00:36:20,040 --> 00:36:25,040
When you return from the trip, I’ll tell you.

259
00:36:26,360 --> 00:36:30,880
I’m back. Please wake up and welcome me with your kiss.

260
00:36:34,760 --> 00:36:35,560
Kaew…

261
00:36:38,360 --> 00:36:43,640
You’ve promised me, haven’t you? I’m back now.

262
00:36:44,600 --> 00:36:50,640
Wake up, my dear. Wake up and talk to me.

263
00:36:52,160 --> 00:36:53,520
[For eternity]

264
00:37:03,640 --> 00:37:06,880
I’m back now, my love. My dear Kaewta.

265
00:37:06,880 --> 00:37:09,680
My dear…I’m back.

266
00:37:10,600 --> 00:37:13,280
Please wake up and talk to me, Kaew.

267
00:37:13,280 --> 00:37:15,200
Please…

268
00:37:15,200 --> 00:37:15,920
Kaew!

269
00:37:17,280 --> 00:37:18,640
I’m back.

270
00:37:20,280 --> 00:37:21,920
I’m back now, Kaew.

271
00:37:25,280 --> 00:37:29,800
Son, please try to restrain yourself.

272
00:37:29,800 --> 00:37:32,080
Kaewta is already dead.

273
00:37:34,960 --> 00:37:35,920
Kaew!

274
00:37:46,600 --> 00:37:48,760
Who did this, Father?

275
00:37:50,680 --> 00:37:52,760
Who killed my Kaewta!

276
00:38:02,000 --> 00:38:04,000
Miss!

277
00:38:04,000 --> 00:38:05,160
Miss!

278
00:38:06,440 --> 00:38:10,520
Let’s go now! His Lordship has found out about everything.

279
00:38:10,520 --> 00:38:13,560
He said he would send you to the police,

280
00:38:13,560 --> 00:38:15,800
and even let you take the criminal punishment.

281
00:38:17,640 --> 00:38:19,040
Miss!!!

282
00:38:20,480 --> 00:38:22,040
Miss!

283
00:38:23,320 --> 00:38:27,600
If you’re not coming, I’ll go alone then.

284
00:38:29,040 --> 00:38:31,040
Go on, Som.

285
00:38:46,880 --> 00:38:48,320
Miss!

286
00:39:00,280 --> 00:39:07,160
Sophee…did you kill Kaewta?

287
00:39:11,560 --> 00:39:12,760
Khun Yai!

288
00:39:13,320 --> 00:39:17,520
I’m asking you! Did you kill Kaewta?

289
00:39:19,280 --> 00:39:23,960
Yes, I killed him. He deserved to die.

290
00:39:26,000 --> 00:39:28,560
He seduced you and fooled you to love him instead of me.

291
00:39:28,680 --> 00:39:29,520
Sophee!

292
00:39:33,920 --> 00:39:36,760
Are you going to kill me now, Brother?

293
00:39:37,560 --> 00:39:43,880
Yai, please stop. I’m begging you.

294
00:39:57,480 --> 00:40:03,280
This woman is no longer my sister.

295
00:40:06,360 --> 00:40:12,000
From now on, whether in this life or any other life…

296
00:40:13,040 --> 00:40:15,640
we shall never meet ever again!

297
00:40:20,800 --> 00:40:21,480
Brother!

298
00:40:21,480 --> 00:40:22,440
Khun Yai!

299
00:40:23,080 --> 00:40:24,000
Sophee!

300
00:40:28,000 --> 00:40:28,960
That’s enough!

301
00:40:30,800 --> 00:40:32,800
I can’t believe you’re my daughter.

302
00:40:35,280 --> 00:40:37,760
How can you be so cruel and heartless?

303
00:40:37,920 --> 00:40:39,600
Father…

304
00:40:41,280 --> 00:40:45,440
You shall get…the punishment you deserve.

305
00:40:52,760 --> 00:40:54,480
Miss.

306
00:40:55,680 --> 00:40:58,000
Oh, my dear Miss!

307
00:41:35,640 --> 00:41:43,480
I hereby vow, should the next life exist,

308
00:41:43,480 --> 00:41:48,880
I shall remember this love and pain…

309
00:41:55,520 --> 00:41:58,400
to get back at all of them!

310
00:42:47,880 --> 00:42:53,000
Khun Yai, you haven’t eaten for many days now.

311
00:42:54,120 --> 00:42:58,880
Not even a sip of water. Please, sir.

312
00:42:59,280 --> 00:43:01,480
If you keep going on like this,

313
00:43:07,480 --> 00:43:08,680
Yes, sir.

314
00:43:37,160 --> 00:43:41,560
Khun Yai. I’m going in, sir.

315
00:44:01,000 --> 00:44:02,320
Khun Yai…

316
00:44:28,000 --> 00:44:31,680
Then, I shall follow you, sir.

317
00:44:46,840 --> 00:44:49,160
Kaew. Wake up, Kaew!

318
00:44:49,160 --> 00:44:50,280
You have to run!

319
00:44:50,600 --> 00:44:52,480
Kaew! Kaew!

320
00:45:15,200 --> 00:45:17,080
Oh, you’re awake?

321
00:45:18,800 --> 00:45:22,280
Miss Sophee, what are you doing?

322
00:45:23,480 --> 00:45:27,240
I’m going to make you and the white house disappear from this world.

323
00:45:27,360 --> 00:45:30,200
So that Brother would finally be mine in this life!

324
00:45:33,840 --> 00:45:36,240
Surely, you don’t mean me…

325
00:45:38,080 --> 00:45:43,000
You lied. You said you drew his portrait without having met him before.

326
00:45:44,560 --> 00:45:51,920
But I saw you seducing my man the other day. Just like what you did in the past life.

327
00:45:54,280 --> 00:45:56,440
That wasn’t Khun Yai!

328
00:45:56,800 --> 00:45:58,360
Liar!

329
00:45:59,960 --> 00:46:02,360
Please stop, Miss Sophee.

330
00:46:03,120 --> 00:46:06,120
You have already committed so many sins…

331
00:46:06,840 --> 00:46:09,840
both in this life and the past life.

332
00:46:10,800 --> 00:46:14,720
Please stop now, and I will forgive you.

333
00:46:19,600 --> 00:46:21,000
Never!

334
00:46:21,840 --> 00:46:26,640
As long as you’re still alive, he will never look at me.

335
00:46:38,560 --> 00:46:40,120
Kaew!

336
00:46:41,240 --> 00:46:42,800
No! No!

337
00:46:43,320 --> 00:46:44,720
Don’t!

338
00:46:45,080 --> 00:46:46,360
Please don’t, Miss Sophee! Don’t!

339
00:46:46,360 --> 00:46:48,080
No!

340
00:46:55,080 --> 00:46:56,320
Kaew!

341
00:46:57,840 --> 00:47:00,120
Stop! What are you doing?

342
00:47:00,120 --> 00:47:01,320
What the heck are you doing?

343
00:47:02,320 --> 00:47:03,840
Brother!

344
00:47:04,160 --> 00:47:07,160
Ajarn! He’s not Khun Yai!

345
00:47:08,080 --> 00:47:11,960
You mean that man who looks like me?

346
00:47:15,080 --> 00:47:21,080
Brother! My love! You’re mine…

347
00:47:21,080 --> 00:47:22,640
not his!

348
00:47:22,640 --> 00:47:26,600
Please don’t do this. Let go!

349
00:47:28,120 --> 00:47:30,440
Kaew, I’ve got you.

350
00:47:38,360 --> 00:47:39,720
Watch out!

351
00:47:40,080 --> 00:47:41,720
Ajarn!

352
00:47:56,680 --> 00:47:59,680
No…No! No!

353
00:48:01,640 --> 00:48:04,040
No! No!

354
00:48:44,520 --> 00:48:48,840
Kaew, I’m here. Kaew…

355

Although his soul is probably in heaven by now,

410
00:57:10,360 --> 00:57:13,360
but I’ve taken possession of his body without his permission.

411

Even if it was for a justifiable reason, I still can’t help feeling guilty.

412

Also, you only did it to save my life.

414

You’re right. As long as I’m still alive in this body,

417
00:58:12,280 --> 00:58:17,400
I should use it to do good deeds, and dedicate those merits to Ajarn Prem.
