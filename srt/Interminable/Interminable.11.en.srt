You know what to do, don’t you?

Tomorrow is your big day. I’m here to give you encouragement.

7
00:00:19,380 --> 00:00:20,300
Kaew!

8
00:00:21,400 --> 00:00:23,460
If you’ve already made up your mind,

9
00:00:23,860 --> 00:00:27,260
then I wouldn’t be able to shatter my only son’s hope.

10
00:00:27,660 --> 00:00:29,200
Thank you, Mum.

11
00:00:32,700 --> 00:00:36,860
I heard she had received a love letter not long before she ran away.

12
00:00:36,860 --> 00:00:41,260
If your mind is trapped in the past, you might not be able to come back.

13
00:00:41,380 --> 00:00:43,100
Why are you asking me?

14
00:00:43,100 --> 00:00:46,180
Because I know how you feel about Kaew.

15
00:00:46,180 --> 00:00:49,980
If that’s what you want, then don’t regret it later.

30
00:03:03,130 --> 00:03:04,260
Brother.

31
00:03:12,930 --> 00:03:17,760
Who were you talking to earlier?

32
00:03:25,560 --> 00:03:28,180
Me? Talking to whom?

33
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:30,660
I wasn’t talking to anyone.

34
00:03:32,200 --> 00:03:33,100
But earlier…

35
00:03:34,329 --> 00:03:35,130
Kaew.

36
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:41,160
What are you doing out here alone?

37
00:03:42,530 --> 00:03:49,060
I’m taking a walk. The weather is really nice, so I was just humming along.

38
00:03:51,260 --> 00:03:52,260
Is that so?

39
00:03:53,220 --> 00:03:55,020
I thought you were…

40
00:03:55,660 --> 00:03:56,980
Talking to Khun Yai?

41
00:04:01,700 --> 00:04:02,500
Listen, Kaew.

42
00:04:03,400 --> 00:04:05,060
If he doesn’t even let you see him,

43
00:04:06,200 --> 00:04:08,220
why would he let me?

44
00:04:12,330 --> 00:04:13,130
You’re right.

45
00:04:15,060 --> 00:04:17,660
Let’s go then.

46
00:04:18,800 --> 00:04:19,600
Come.

47
00:04:24,960 --> 00:04:25,700
Kaew.

48
00:04:27,260 --> 00:04:28,420
Come on.

49
00:04:40,560 --> 00:04:43,580
You brat! What lies did you tell Father about me?

50
00:04:43,600 --> 00:04:44,659
Please don’t, sir.

51
00:04:44,659 --> 00:04:45,500
Fuck off!

52
00:04:46,330 --> 00:04:47,360
It’s all right, Saen.

53
00:04:52,930 --> 00:04:54,260
It was you, wasn’t it?

54
00:04:54,900 --> 00:04:57,860
Father scolded me that day because of you!

55
00:04:58,760 --> 00:05:00,700
Father must have his own reason for doing that.

56
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:02,580
If I did tell him about you,

57
00:05:02,860 --> 00:05:04,930
Father wouldn’t have let you off the hook to keep barking at me like this!

58
00:05:05,660 --> 00:05:06,500
You, son of a bitch!

59
00:05:06,500 --> 00:05:08,180
- Khun Prom.
- Stop it right now!

60
00:05:10,800 --> 00:05:12,300
Why are you doing this?

61
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:14,500
What is going on here?

62
00:05:29,060 --> 00:05:31,740
Tell our men to spread out the gossip about that brat.

63
00:05:31,740 --> 00:05:33,820
Make sure the whole town is talking about it.

64
00:05:34,159 --> 00:05:35,260
Yes, sir.

65
00:05:37,730 --> 00:05:39,820
I shall never set foot in here again.

66
00:05:39,820 --> 00:05:41,700
Not until I can rule over him!

67
00:05:42,659 --> 00:05:46,940
One day, Father will see that a real son like me…

68
00:05:47,060 --> 00:05:51,540
is much better than that nasty orphan he has adopted from the pits.

69
00:05:54,659 --> 00:05:56,060
Go do as I said.

70
00:05:57,060 --> 00:05:57,860
Yes, sir.

71
00:06:04,060 --> 00:06:04,860
Kan.

72
00:06:05,300 --> 00:06:06,100
Kan!

73
00:06:07,460 --> 00:06:08,700
- Why are you here early?
- Why are you here early?

74
00:06:11,800 --> 00:06:12,820
Wait.

75
00:06:12,820 --> 00:06:15,020
I have something to talk to you.

76
00:06:15,260 --> 00:06:19,620
If you don’t want to heed my advice, then let’s not talk anymore.

77
00:06:19,620 --> 00:06:21,100
It won’t do any good.

78
00:06:21,420 --> 00:06:26,780
Even if you try to give me all the reasons in the world, I still don’t agree with you.

79
00:06:28,360 --> 00:06:30,300
We might have different opinions.

80
00:06:31,020 --> 00:06:35,300
But why can’t we still be friends like before?

81
00:06:35,460 --> 00:06:38,060
Who do you think she is?

82
00:06:38,060 --> 00:06:44,500
I wonder who she is too—the dancer who’s so lucky to be loved by the handsome Khun Phra Nai.

83
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:50,420
What are you girls talking about?

84
00:06:50,560 --> 00:06:52,300
Haven’t you heard?

85
00:06:53,100 --> 00:06:53,900
Heard what?

86
00:06:54,159 --> 00:06:56,900
Geez, the whole town is gossiping about it.

87
00:06:56,900 --> 00:07:00,500
That Khun Phra Nai is infatuated with a dancer here at Luang Sanor’s place.

88
00:07:01,730 --> 00:07:03,580
I really want to know who it is.

89
00:07:03,600 --> 00:07:04,730
Me too.

90
00:07:06,420 --> 00:07:07,460
We should try to find out then.

91
00:07:10,930 --> 00:07:18,900
There’s a rumour that you’re infatuated with a dancer at Luang Sanor’s place,

92
00:07:19,620 --> 00:07:21,620
is it true?

93
00:07:22,300 --> 00:07:24,340
Of course not, Father.

94
00:07:24,340 --> 00:07:26,660
People just talk.

95
00:07:27,340 --> 00:07:29,580
Isn’t that right, Brother?

96
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:39,360
It is true.

97
00:07:44,860 --> 00:07:46,560
I’m in love with this person.

98
00:07:47,530 --> 00:07:49,780
That’s not possible since…

99
00:07:49,780 --> 00:07:50,820
Miss.

100
00:07:54,700 --> 00:07:56,780
Please tell me it’s not true.

101
00:07:56,780 --> 00:07:59,180
Who is it?

102
00:08:00,400 --> 00:08:06,160
I can’t tell you. That person doesn’t want anyone to know about us.

103
00:08:06,360 --> 00:08:06,900
That’s not true!

104
00:08:06,900 --> 00:08:08,580
Miss.

105
00:08:12,660 --> 00:08:13,980
Break up with her.

106
00:08:15,160 --> 00:08:17,580
And I’ll arrange a marriage between you and Sophee.

107
00:08:18,500 --> 00:08:20,160
I beg your pardon, Father.

108
00:08:21,960 --> 00:08:23,900
Why are you surprised?

109
00:08:25,700 --> 00:08:32,059
The whole town already knows that one day I’ll marry her off to you.

110
00:08:32,600 --> 00:08:34,860
But I’ve already told you, Father.

111
00:08:34,860 --> 00:08:37,419
That I’ve never seen Sophee as anything else…

112
00:08:37,419 --> 00:08:40,340
but a sister.

113
00:08:42,460 --> 00:08:43,580
Brother.

114
00:08:47,400 --> 00:08:51,900
No matter what, I’m not going to marry her.

115
00:09:12,160 --> 00:09:15,900
Then, you should leave this house.

116
00:09:16,100 --> 00:09:17,700
Father!

117
00:09:39,900 --> 00:09:40,820
Saen.

118
00:09:40,820 --> 00:09:41,660
Khun Kaew.

119
00:09:42,180 --> 00:09:43,780
What are you doing here?

120
00:09:44,360 --> 00:09:49,220
Well, I…I heard about the rumour and I’m worried.

121
00:09:50,220 --> 00:09:52,380
How’s Khun Yai doing?

122
00:09:55,360 --> 00:09:56,340
Khun Yai…

123
00:09:58,380 --> 00:10:00,100
Please tell me, Saen.

124
00:10:02,200 --> 00:10:04,260
His Lordship already knew about the rumour.

125
00:10:04,560 --> 00:10:06,100
They had a serious argument.

126
00:10:06,800 --> 00:10:08,740
And his Lordship has ordered Khun Yai to…

127
00:10:10,530 --> 00:10:13,540
Please tell me everything.

128
00:10:16,400 --> 00:10:19,060
His Lordship has ordered Khun Yai to marry Lady Sophee.

129
00:10:20,300 --> 00:10:21,740
But Khun Yai refused.

130
00:10:22,730 --> 00:10:24,700
So, his Lordship told him to get out of the house.

131
00:10:25,760 --> 00:10:26,560
What?

132
00:10:27,400 --> 00:10:28,780
He’s thrown out of the house?

133
00:10:28,780 --> 00:10:29,700
Yes.

134
00:10:31,260 --> 00:10:32,730
You can’t go in, Khun Kaew.

135
00:10:34,700 --> 00:10:36,460
But please don’t worry.

136
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:38,400
Khun Yai has already prepared a…

137
00:10:44,260 --> 00:10:48,060
Saen, please don’t tell him that I came here.

138
00:10:51,560 --> 00:10:52,980
I’m going then.

139
00:10:53,820 --> 00:10:55,980
Hold on, Khun Kaew.

140
00:10:56,380 --> 00:10:57,460
Khun Kaew!

141
00:11:08,300 --> 00:11:11,530
You said Kaewta isn’t here yet?

142
00:11:12,200 --> 00:11:13,000
That’s right.

143
00:11:13,930 --> 00:11:17,800
You’re lying. Miss Payom told me earlier that Khun Kaew has already left.

144
00:11:18,260 --> 00:11:22,020
Get your hands off me. Why on earth would I lie?

145
00:11:24,700 --> 00:11:28,260
Do you think we don’t know how you feel about Khun Kaew?

146
00:11:28,860 --> 00:11:34,340
That’s enough, Saen. Please tell Kaewta that I’ll give him time.

147
00:11:34,340 --> 00:11:36,500
And that he can come to see me whenever he’s ready.

148
00:11:36,860 --> 00:11:39,420
Yes, sir. I’ll tell him that.

149
00:11:40,340 --> 00:11:43,220
So, are we done here?

150
00:11:43,360 --> 00:11:44,500
Get lost!

151
00:11:58,760 --> 00:12:01,260
Khun Kaew has been avoiding you for many days now.

152
00:12:02,530 --> 00:12:04,940
That rumour must have scared him badly.

153
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:09,600
The more reason you two should get to talk.

154
00:12:10,800 --> 00:12:15,540
But I’m afraid Kaew might not want to see me again.

155
00:12:25,930 --> 00:12:30,860
Whether now or in the past, both are willing to suffer for each other.

156
00:12:49,860 --> 00:12:54,900
Kaew, do you still can’t see Khun Yai and the others?

157
00:12:56,500 --> 00:12:57,300
Mhm.

158
00:12:58,500 --> 00:13:05,580
Luangta told me that’s the fastest way to dedicate all the merits to them.

159
00:13:07,900 --> 00:13:13,020
But I still can’t see them. I don’t get it too, Ruedee.

160
00:13:16,100 --> 00:13:20,300
I think everything on earth has its own time and season.

161
00:13:28,700 --> 00:13:32,930
I also try to believe there must be an unexplainable reason for this.

162
00:14:06,260 --> 00:14:07,540
Hello, everyone.

163
00:14:08,730 --> 00:14:12,700
Kaew, isn’t that the guy we met the other day?

164
00:14:14,060 --> 00:14:19,500
I heard he’s a replacement for Ajarn Kitti. He even graduated from Italy.

165
00:14:22,960 --> 00:14:26,660
I’m Prem. I’ll be your special instructor today.

166
00:14:27,200 --> 00:14:28,980
Please continue with your work.

167
00:15:18,860 --> 00:15:24,900
Your drawing looks firm yet gracefully and alive.

168
00:15:35,460 --> 00:15:38,340
We’ve met before. Do you remember?

169
00:15:43,530 --> 00:15:44,330
Yes.

170
00:15:45,500 --> 00:15:47,260
I’m glad you do.

171
00:15:56,560 --> 00:15:59,760
Your drawing is different from the others. It has a feeling of nostalgia.

172
00:16:02,260 --> 00:16:04,380
I draw from my memories.

173
00:16:06,330 --> 00:16:09,500
I believe they must be beautiful and ones to cherish for.

174
00:16:44,700 --> 00:16:46,100
That rascal Sin.

175
00:16:47,460 --> 00:16:51,540
Leaving all doors and windows opened, is he trying to invite the thief to rob this house or what?

176
00:16:53,930 --> 00:16:54,730
Dad.

177
00:16:55,860 --> 00:16:56,700
Sin.

178
00:16:58,060 --> 00:16:59,460
How come you can see me?

00:17:00,530 --> 00:17:02,300
Why won’t I be able to see you?

180
00:17:04,660 --> 00:17:05,460
Well…

181
00:17:07,099 --> 00:17:07,900
Hang on.

182
00:17:08,930 --> 00:17:11,700
Don’t tell me that all this time, you’ve been trying to avoid me.

183
00:17:12,660 --> 00:17:14,400
No, I…

184
00:17:14,700 --> 00:17:15,380
Wait.

185
00:17:15,500 --> 00:17:17,800
When Khun Kaew is back from the university, I’ll tell him.

186
00:17:17,930 --> 00:17:19,220
Don’t you dare.

187
00:17:20,130 --> 00:17:21,700
It’s an order from Khun Phra Nai.

188
00:17:21,700 --> 00:17:24,260
What? Why?

189
00:17:25,359 --> 00:17:29,340
Do you know Khun Kaew and I have been making meditation every single day without taking any break?

190
00:17:31,160 --> 00:17:33,660
I know. I’m sorry.

191
00:17:35,400 --> 00:17:39,180
But this is probably the least painful way to say goodbye.

192
00:17:41,960 --> 00:17:42,760
Dad.

193
00:18:26,780 --> 00:18:27,380
Khun Kaew.

194
00:18:27,380 --> 00:18:28,180
Don’t.

195
00:18:31,860 --> 00:18:33,700
Why are you so stubborn?

196
00:18:45,580 --> 00:18:46,660
Khun Yai.

197
00:18:52,600 --> 00:18:55,500
I miss you so much, Khun Yai.

198
00:18:56,860 --> 00:19:00,460
Khun Yai, are you sure this is the least painful way to say goodbye?

199
00:19:01,300 --> 00:19:02,460
Sin.

200
00:19:04,760 --> 00:19:08,020
I also don’t understand why Sin can still see us,

201
00:19:08,020 --> 00:19:08,940
despite the fact that we…

202
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:09,980
A desire…

203
00:19:12,020 --> 00:19:14,060
is much more powerful than you think, Saen.

204
00:19:23,360 --> 00:19:24,540
Khun Yai.

205
00:19:25,800 --> 00:19:29,420
Remember those sufferings and pain you felt while you were waiting for Khun Kaew?

206
00:19:31,360 --> 00:19:33,380
That’s what he’s feeling now.

207
00:19:35,730 --> 00:19:38,100
Sin is right, Khun Yai.

208
00:19:40,860 --> 00:19:45,620
Shouldn’t we at least try to be happy and make the most of this little time we have left?

209
00:20:21,960 --> 00:20:22,860
There you are.

210
00:21:00,760 --> 00:21:01,860
Khun Yai.

211
00:21:08,760 --> 00:21:09,560
No.

212
00:21:13,200 --> 00:21:18,060
Khun Yai again. I really wonder what he looks like.

213
00:21:55,100 --> 00:21:57,100
Who are you looking for?

214
00:21:59,730 --> 00:22:03,340
How did you get here?

215
00:22:10,130 --> 00:22:12,660
It was me. I took him here.

216
00:22:12,860 --> 00:22:15,780
Ajarn wants to sketch some architecture.

217
00:22:15,780 --> 00:22:19,780
That made me think of your white house. So, I just took him here.

218
00:22:20,960 --> 00:22:25,260
I hope you won’t mind that I came unannounced.

219
00:22:28,130 --> 00:22:34,800
My apologies but I’m afraid this place isn’t what you’re looking for.

220
00:22:36,500 --> 00:22:37,940
Why not?

221
00:22:39,130 --> 00:22:40,460
Look at the house.

222
00:22:41,560 --> 00:22:43,380
It has such an exquisite design.

223
00:22:43,660 --> 00:22:46,860
This shows that the owner must be very fond of this house.

224
00:22:51,900 --> 00:22:56,540
That’s why the owner won’t allow it.

225
00:22:57,760 --> 00:23:01,600
But Ruedee said you’re the owner.

226
00:23:06,100 --> 00:23:12,500
Well…actually, Kaewta is not the sole owner of this house. There’s someone else too.

227
00:23:14,660 --> 00:23:18,820
I see. But I’m already here anyway.

228
00:23:20,960 --> 00:23:25,980
Then, I’ll help you find a new place to sketch.

229
00:23:27,060 --> 00:23:31,340
You seem to be very protective of this house. What are you hiding?

230
00:23:33,730 --> 00:23:35,460
Is there something you don’t want me to see?

231
00:23:35,700 --> 00:23:40,420
Kaew, how about we take him to Wat Arun then?

232
00:23:41,260 --> 00:23:45,130
That’s good. You’ll probably like it there.

233
00:23:52,930 --> 00:23:55,300
How pity I am, I couldn’t even…

234
00:23:57,200 --> 00:23:59,020
pick a flower for him.

235
00:24:04,960 --> 00:24:09,130
Geez, it was about to get better earlier.

236
00:24:11,600 --> 00:24:15,000
Does this mean Khun Kaew will never see Khun Yai again, Dad?

237
00:24:30,130 --> 00:24:32,760
It seems this place is also not what you’re looking for.

238
00:24:33,500 --> 00:24:35,800
I told you I like your white house.

239
00:24:36,600 --> 00:24:40,460
But above all, I’d like to try to get to know you more.

240
00:24:40,730 --> 00:24:43,600
It makes me want to draw the white house and your portrait.

241
00:24:44,960 --> 00:24:47,660
Can you ask the other owner for me?

242
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:50,800
No.

243
00:24:51,860 --> 00:24:53,140
So mean.

244
00:24:54,660 --> 00:24:59,860
Let me put my things back first, and I’ll drop you off at home. Please wait here.

245
00:24:59,860 --> 00:25:00,900
Yes.

246
00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:11,000
I know what you’re thinking, Ruedee.

247
00:25:12,460 --> 00:25:16,700
Listen, Ajarn Prem likes you, Kaew.

248
00:25:17,020 --> 00:25:20,460
Maybe, you’ll find true love this time.

249
00:25:21,600 --> 00:25:24,980
How’s that possible? He’s not Khun Yai.

250
00:25:25,660 --> 00:25:27,260
But he does looks like Khun Yai.

251
00:25:28,460 --> 00:25:30,860
Khun Yai is the only one I love.

252
00:25:31,140 --> 00:25:34,420
He might look like Khun Yai in flesh and blood.

253
00:25:35,060 --> 00:25:40,180
But he still can’t replace Khun Yai. Don’t you get it, Ruedee?

254
00:25:41,580 --> 00:25:48,020
Yes, I do. Look, I promise I won’t do this to you again. Please forgive me, Kaew.

255
00:25:48,020 --> 00:25:49,260
Please.

256
00:25:49,260 --> 00:25:50,380
Please forgive me.

257
00:25:51,060 --> 00:25:51,980
Okay?

258
00:25:57,330 --> 00:25:58,500
Kaewta.

259
00:26:02,100 --> 00:26:04,420
- Let’s go.
 - Yes.

260
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:07,300
Brother…

261
00:26:08,930 --> 00:26:11,340
Can you ask him again, please?

262
00:26:16,930 --> 00:26:18,700
I really want to draw your portrait.

263
00:26:22,400 --> 00:26:23,980
My love.

264
00:26:41,500 --> 00:26:46,420
You’ve insisted so firmly like that, so of course, I must believe you.

265
00:26:47,020 --> 00:26:51,100
Anyway, how important is this man in the picture

266
00:26:51,100 --> 00:26:53,700
Why do you only draw his portrait?

267
00:26:56,160 --> 00:26:59,740
I couldn’t quite fathom it either.

268
00:27:02,100 --> 00:27:03,700
Where have you met him?

269
00:27:06,360 --> 00:27:09,500
I’m asking you. Answer me.

270
00:27:12,700 --> 00:27:13,900
In his dream.

271
00:27:15,380 --> 00:27:21,500
Khun Kaewta told me that he met this man in his dream, Miss.

272
00:27:22,200 --> 00:27:23,000
Really?

273
00:27:25,460 --> 00:27:26,260
Yes.

274
00:27:28,130 --> 00:27:29,600
That day, you told me you didn’t know him.

275
00:27:30,930 --> 00:27:33,860
Now, you’re walking side by side like you’ve known him for so long.

276
00:27:35,900 --> 00:27:37,730
You’re nothing but a big fat liar.

277
00:27:38,560 --> 00:27:42,060
Whether in the past or this life, your true colour has never changed.

278
00:27:43,260 --> 00:27:48,100
How dare you try to fool me? I’m not going to be fooled twice!

279
00:28:08,600 --> 00:28:10,860
I thought Ruedee came to see you…

280
00:28:10,860 --> 00:28:15,420
so I brought a lot of desserts. Can you finish them all by yourself?

281
00:28:21,260 --> 00:28:23,900
What matter brings you here, Miss?

282
00:28:24,930 --> 00:28:30,820
Why are you talking like I’m a stranger? You’re my sister’s best friend. We’re like a family then.

283
00:28:33,500 --> 00:28:35,540
Please try it.

284
00:28:41,930 --> 00:28:44,730
I spent days learning how to make it.

285
00:28:48,460 --> 00:28:51,160
But it probably doesn’t look appetizing. I’ll just…

286
00:29:10,800 --> 00:29:14,020
How is it? Is it good?

287
00:29:18,300 --> 00:29:19,100
Yes.

288
00:29:20,460 --> 00:29:24,060
I’m here because I’d like you to look at something for me.

289
00:29:31,730 --> 00:29:34,740
Wait, this picture...

290
00:29:41,460 --> 00:29:44,660
Isn’t this your drawing?

291
00:29:49,760 --> 00:29:52,200
Where did you get it from, Miss?

292
00:29:54,300 --> 00:29:56,060
Ajarn Kitti sold it to me.

293
00:29:58,100 --> 00:29:59,140
What?

294
00:30:00,420 --> 00:30:04,700
This drawing is mine. He didn’t have the right to sell it to anyone

295
00:30:05,380 --> 00:30:08,300
I’m going to buy it back.

296
00:30:09,600 --> 00:30:12,780
But I paid a lot for this drawing.

297
00:30:13,730 --> 00:30:18,060
How much did you pay, Miss? Can I draw you a new one?

298
00:30:18,760 --> 00:30:21,620
It wasn’t because of your drawing. Don’t be so full of yourself.

299
00:30:21,620 --> 00:30:25,340
I paid that much because it’s him in this picture.

300
00:30:31,130 --> 00:30:35,060
Do you know who…

301
00:30:35,900 --> 00:30:37,900
the man in this picture is?

302
00:30:39,600 --> 00:30:43,820
Who else could he be…if not my love!

303
00:30:43,820 --> 00:30:47,700
Is this the renowned white house of Chao Meun Samur Jairatch?

304
00:30:47,700 --> 00:30:49,780
NO! NO!!

305
00:30:56,560 --> 00:30:58,140
Lady Sophee…

306
00:31:32,600 --> 00:31:33,400
Kaew.

307
00:31:34,730 --> 00:31:38,100
Kaew. Kaew! My dear Kaewta!

308
00:31:40,800 --> 00:31:41,600
Khun Yai.

309
00:31:43,300 --> 00:31:44,100
Kaew.

310
00:31:45,800 --> 00:31:46,600
Khun Yai.

311
00:31:51,360 --> 00:31:53,460
Kaew!

312
00:32:27,360 --> 00:32:31,460
Khun Kaew! I’ve been looking for you everywhere.

313
00:32:32,460 --> 00:32:33,600
What is it, Saen?

314
00:32:33,800 --> 00:32:35,400
Something’s wrong with Khun Phra Nai.

315
00:32:35,760 --> 00:32:38,460
What happened to him?

316
00:32:38,730 --> 00:32:41,700
Our servant told me that Khun Phra Nai has tried to jump into the river to kill himself.

317
00:32:41,700 --> 00:32:44,700
What?! Where is he now?

318
00:32:44,730 --> 00:32:46,530
That way. Please follow me.

319
00:32:52,700 --> 00:32:54,820
Khun Yai! Khun Yai!

320
00:32:55,360 --> 00:32:56,160
Kaew.

321
00:32:58,100 --> 00:33:01,100
I haven’t seen you for so long. I miss you so much.

322
00:33:06,100 --> 00:33:06,930
Liar.

323
00:33:09,460 --> 00:33:11,460
What? Who’s lying?

324
00:33:15,000 --> 00:33:18,530
Saen told me you tried to kill yourself.

325
00:33:19,460 --> 00:33:20,360
Me?

326
00:33:22,500 --> 00:33:25,200
I only told Saen to bring you here.

327
00:33:28,560 --> 00:33:29,900
You tricked me.

328
00:33:30,160 --> 00:33:32,820
Oh, no. I wouldn’t dare.

329
00:33:32,960 --> 00:33:37,560
Because he knew if he hadn’t done that, you would’ve never agreed to come and see me.

330
00:33:39,930 --> 00:33:42,200
I’m going home then.

331
00:33:42,820 --> 00:33:45,260
Wait, don’t go.

332
00:33:45,660 --> 00:33:48,500
Kaew, it’s just a rumour.

333
00:33:48,500 --> 00:33:50,300
Why do you keep avoiding me?

334
00:33:53,200 --> 00:33:55,560
Please leave me alone, Khun Yai.

335
00:33:56,600 --> 00:34:00,500
Otherwise, you’d get into more troubles.

336
00:34:02,060 --> 00:34:06,220
No. If I had to leave you alone,

337
00:34:07,330 --> 00:34:09,100
I’d rather die.

338
00:34:10,860 --> 00:34:11,659
Khun Yai.

339
00:34:13,000 --> 00:34:14,659
Please don’t say that.

340
00:34:17,760 --> 00:34:19,179
So, you still care about me…

341
00:34:19,699 --> 00:34:21,460
and don’t want me to die, do you?

342
00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:33,620
Then, please stop telling me to break up with you.

343
00:34:34,420 --> 00:34:38,900
Because even if I’m dead, I’d never stop loving you.

344
00:34:42,400 --> 00:34:43,780
You’re stubborn.

345
00:34:46,460 --> 00:34:48,199
So are you. You’re much worse.

346
00:34:52,260 --> 00:34:53,530
- Saen.
- Yes, sir.

347
00:34:56,960 --> 00:34:57,760
Let’s go.

348
00:35:00,900 --> 00:35:01,700
Khun Yai.

349
00:35:03,130 --> 00:35:05,060
Where are you taking me?

350
00:35:05,730 --> 00:35:07,360
To see the fireflies.

351
00:35:12,800 --> 00:35:14,300
Please watch your steps.

352
00:36:15,700 --> 00:36:16,530
Isn’t it beautiful?

353
00:36:20,660 --> 00:36:21,860
Yes, so beautiful.

354
00:36:27,400 --> 00:36:30,620
So beautiful indeed.

355
00:36:35,560 --> 00:36:37,160
I really want you to see it.

356
00:36:42,200 --> 00:36:43,460
Thank you.

357
00:36:50,200 --> 00:36:54,060
I love you, my dear Kaewta.

358
00:37:33,000 --> 00:37:39,660
Kaew, can I spend my life with you…

359
00:37:40,700 --> 00:37:42,760
until my very last breath?

360
00:37:48,700 --> 00:37:49,530
Can I?

361
00:38:02,730 --> 00:38:04,060
Yes.

362
00:40:38,060 --> 00:40:39,780
What is going on, Brother?

363
00:40:40,500 --> 00:40:42,100
Where are you going?

364
00:40:42,730 --> 00:40:46,130
The white house is ready to move in. I’m going to live there.

365
00:40:47,860 --> 00:40:48,800
What?

366
00:40:56,500 --> 00:41:01,580
I am deeply grateful to your kindness. Every breath I take…

367
00:41:03,000 --> 00:41:05,540
will always remind me how immensely I am indebted to you, Father.

368
00:41:07,700 --> 00:41:08,730
But for my heart,

369
00:41:11,330 --> 00:41:15,000
I do hope you’d understand and let me choose it my own way.

370
00:41:19,000 --> 00:41:23,540
Good. If you insist to be involved with that lowly dancer…

371
00:41:23,540 --> 00:41:26,580
and do not wish to marry Sophee,

372
00:41:32,400 --> 00:41:33,740
I won’t stop you.

373
00:41:48,660 --> 00:41:51,130
Are you really going to leave me like this, Brother?

374
00:41:53,400 --> 00:41:54,860
Please don’t go.

375
00:41:58,930 --> 00:42:03,900
Sophee, no matter where I am,

376
00:42:05,620 --> 00:42:10,700
you’ll always be my one and only sister. And it will never change.

377
00:42:14,660 --> 00:42:16,130
Sister?

378
00:42:20,730 --> 00:42:24,600
Why? Why can’t you love me as a lady?

379
00:42:26,100 --> 00:42:28,730
What did I do wrong? What’s so bad about me?

380
00:42:31,100 --> 00:42:35,140
Sophee, you’re one of the finest ladies I’ve ever known.

381
00:42:35,860 --> 00:42:40,980
To have you as a wife would be such a great fortune for that man.

382
00:42:42,100 --> 00:42:44,220
Then why?

383
00:42:49,330 --> 00:42:50,660
Love…

384
00:42:51,500 --> 00:42:53,560
isn’t something you can control.

385
00:42:55,930 --> 00:42:58,700
However perfect or wonderful that person might be,

386
00:43:00,100 --> 00:43:01,700
if they’re not the one in your heart;

387
00:43:04,160 --> 00:43:06,580
you can never force yourself to love them.

388
00:43:11,060 --> 00:43:13,620
But my love for you,

389
00:43:17,360 --> 00:43:20,220
even though it’s not something between a man and a woman;

390
00:43:21,100 --> 00:43:23,420
is still pure and innocent.

391
00:43:24,020 --> 00:43:27,100
It’s the love of a brother who wishes nothing but happiness for his sister.

392
00:43:29,600 --> 00:43:31,900
And it shall remain like that for the rest of my life.

393
00:43:44,060 --> 00:43:45,560
Please forget about me, Sophee.

394
00:43:48,700 --> 00:43:51,600
There are plenty of men who’d love you and deserve to be with you.

395
00:44:02,800 --> 00:44:03,600
Saen.

396
00:44:08,700 --> 00:44:09,940
Brother!

397
00:44:13,020 --> 00:44:16,180
Miss.

398
00:44:16,660 --> 00:44:18,060
My dear Miss.

399
00:44:35,930 --> 00:44:38,530
The dancer that he loves isn’t Ruedee.

400
00:44:39,560 --> 00:44:40,740
Oh dear.

401
00:44:41,900 --> 00:44:45,460
Go find out who that dancer is.

402
00:44:47,200 --> 00:44:49,300
Whoever you are,

403
00:44:49,730 --> 00:44:54,220
you shall never take him away from me! I won’t let you!

404
00:45:16,360 --> 00:45:19,740
It’s beautiful. Whose house is this?

405
00:45:21,960 --> 00:45:23,000
Do you want to guess?

406
00:45:24,930 --> 00:45:28,340
How would I know?

407
00:45:30,730 --> 00:45:33,130
It’s our house.

408
00:45:34,930 --> 00:45:36,300
I beg your pardon.

409
00:45:38,730 --> 00:45:41,220
I have had this house built for quite a while.

410
00:45:42,530 --> 00:45:44,300
I plan to live here.

411
00:45:44,940 --> 00:45:47,300
And build a family with the one I love.

412
00:45:49,730 --> 00:45:53,600
And this house was completely done on the day that I met you.

414
00:46:05,130 --> 00:46:09,420
Please move here and live with me in our house.

415
00:46:16,060 --> 00:46:18,700
What if I refuse?

416
00:46:23,160 --> 00:46:29,660
Then, I’ll shut it down and lock myself in this house.

417
00:46:46,560 --> 00:46:48,560
It won’t get shut down.

418
00:47:31,160 --> 00:47:34,060
Do you still not know who that bitch is?

419
00:47:34,660 --> 00:47:39,100
I’ve asked all the servants at Luang Sanor’s place but none of them have any clue, Miss.

420
00:47:39,530 --> 00:47:40,330
Useless.

421
00:47:44,400 --> 00:47:48,300
Miss Sophee, someone from Luang Sanor’s place would like to see you.

422
00:47:48,500 --> 00:47:49,300
Who is it?

423
00:47:50,360 --> 00:47:51,160
Come in.

424
00:47:58,460 --> 00:47:59,300
Kan.

425
00:48:04,130 --> 00:48:05,260
What do you want?

426
00:48:07,100 --> 00:48:10,700
I’d like to ask Lady Sophee for a favour.

427
00:48:10,700 --> 00:48:17,500
Could you please tell your brother, Khun Phra Nai, to leave my younger sibling alone?

428
00:48:20,060 --> 00:48:23,220
My sibling is still young and naïve.

429
00:48:23,220 --> 00:48:28,420
I’m afraid if anyone else finds out about this,

430
00:48:28,420 --> 00:48:33,180
it would only get Khun Phra Nai into trouble.

431
00:48:34,460 --> 00:48:35,740
Who’s your younger sibling?

432
00:48:42,460 --> 00:48:43,700
It’s Kaewta, Miss.

433
00:48:43,700 --> 00:48:46,100
What did you say?!

434
00:48:57,260 --> 00:49:02,660
Oh my goodness! Are you all right, Miss? Please take a deep breath.

435
00:49:04,700 --> 00:49:10,740
I knew it, Miss. That rascal has a face that’s even prettier than a lady.

436
00:49:10,860 --> 00:49:15,940
He must have done something to bewitch Khun Phra Nai and make him fall for him.

437
00:49:16,760 --> 00:49:18,900
Where is Father right now?

438
00:49:20,930 --> 00:49:22,360
Since that incident with Khun Prom,

439
00:49:23,260 --> 00:49:26,180
his Lordship has gone out almost every day, Miss

440
00:49:27,060 --> 00:49:29,860
I’m afraid I must take care of this myself then.
