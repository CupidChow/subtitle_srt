11
00:00:24,560 --> 00:00:28,240
Before I passed out, I saw Khun Yai there.

12
00:00:30,040 --> 00:00:35,360
Tell Kaew, your son, to come to me if he wants to know anything.

13
00:00:36,320 --> 00:00:37,120
A ring?

14
00:00:37,120 --> 00:00:40,440
He told me that if you see this ring, you might remember something.

15
00:00:40,920 --> 00:00:42,480
Remember what?

16
00:00:42,920 --> 00:00:43,880
I don’t know.

17
00:00:44,280 --> 00:00:45,960
Why is Khun Yai in that room?

18
00:00:46,240 --> 00:00:47,520
Something is definitely going on.

19
00:00:48,040 --> 00:00:49,320
I must find out about it.

20
00:01:01,160 --> 00:01:02,200
Khun Yai?

00:01:04,800 --> 00:01:05,600

What is this place?

26
00:02:36,400 --> 00:02:41,520
Chao Meun Samur Jairatch has made a will to pass on this white house to his living descendant.

27
00:02:41,520 --> 00:02:45,120
Khun Kaewta is the only relative that’s still alive.

28
00:02:46,520 --> 00:02:47,760
A relative?

29
00:02:48,920 --> 00:02:51,920
How could I be related to someone of a high ranking like that?

30
00:02:53,120 --> 00:02:54,920
It’s your favourite song, dear.

31
00:02:56,079 --> 00:02:57,640
Do you still remember?

32
00:02:58,840 --> 00:03:00,080
This can’t be.

33
00:03:01,240 --> 00:03:04,040
Who are you? How did you get in here?

34
00:03:04,080 --> 00:03:05,720
You can see him, Khun Kaew?

35
00:03:05,760 --> 00:03:09,240
Don’t be funny, Saen. Of course I can see him. I have eyes.

36
00:03:09,600 --> 00:03:10,840
He can see you!

37
00:03:13,320 --> 00:03:19,040
A friend? Judging from your age, it’s hard to believe you’re Khun Phra Nai’s friend.

38
00:03:19,600 --> 00:03:22,120
Is friendship limited by a person’s age?

39
00:03:22,120 --> 00:03:23,480
I never know that.

40
00:03:24,079 --> 00:03:30,360
Is it possible that someone I saw in my dream
would also exist in real life as if they’re the same person?

41
00:03:31,240 --> 00:03:36,840
Does this mean…Khun Yai is Chao Meun Samur Jairatch?

42
00:04:01,400 --> 00:04:02,360
No.

43
00:04:18,079 --> 00:04:19,160

Is it true or just a belief that it would make us be together in every life?

Keep making merits together,

I see. So, it’s not just a belief then.

185
00:19:13,800 --> 00:19:17,680
Can I join you to make merits like this every day?

186
00:19:25,480 --> 00:19:27,760
No longer bound by promises.

187
00:19:29,960 --> 00:19:33,520
Never to see each other again, whether in this life…

188
00:19:35,040 --> 00:19:37,200
…or any other life.

189
00:19:40,240 --> 00:19:42,000
And be parted forever?

190
00:19:47,720 --> 00:19:48,560
No.

191
00:19:50,120 --> 00:19:52,040
I don’t want that.

192
00:19:54,160 --> 00:19:54,960
Kaew!

193
00:19:55,280 --> 00:19:57,120
Think about it carefully, dear.

194
00:20:04,560 --> 00:20:06,040
But deep down,

195
00:20:07,960 --> 00:20:10,000
that’s how I feel, Mum.

196
00:20:15,800 --> 00:20:17,520
What promise did I give him?

197
00:20:19,400 --> 00:20:21,440
Why is it torturing him like this?

198
00:20:24,680 --> 00:20:28,240
And why does it hurt so much to see him in pain?

199
00:20:33,800 --> 00:20:35,400
I really don’t understand.

200
00:20:41,160 --> 00:20:43,920
The reason he has to suffer like this…

201
00:20:45,960 --> 00:20:48,120
…is because of me, isn’t it, Luangta?

202
00:20:54,520 --> 00:20:56,920
Go back before it’s too late.

203
00:21:01,040 --> 00:21:02,920
What do you mean, Luangta?

204
00:21:09,480 --> 00:21:12,200
Ruedee, what’s going on?

205
00:21:13,680 --> 00:21:17,320
Well, Kaew, it’s…

206
00:21:25,760 --> 00:21:27,200
It’s here.

207
00:21:29,240 --> 00:21:30,480
The white house.

208
00:21:32,160 --> 00:21:33,800
You know this place?

209
00:21:35,600 --> 00:21:36,400
Yes.

210
00:21:39,200 --> 00:21:41,680
I want him out of Kaewta’s life.

211
00:21:43,400 --> 00:21:45,080
As for other demons,

212
00:21:46,360 --> 00:21:48,320
feel free to do as you like.

213
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:33,800
Dad.

214
00:22:39,120 --> 00:22:40,280
What is it?

215
00:22:41,480 --> 00:22:43,720
Who dare trespassing into the area of the white house?

216
00:23:00,200 --> 00:23:02,240
You maggots! Don't you know where your place is?

217
00:23:03,800 --> 00:23:06,160
How dare you bring a shaman to this place?

218
00:23:08,440 --> 00:23:10,400
Because you lot don't stay where you belong.

219
00:23:11,200 --> 00:23:12,640
And keep messing with Kaewta’s life.

220
00:23:12,800 --> 00:23:14,840
It’s you who is messing with his life!

221
00:23:15,920 --> 00:23:18,320
I’m protecting him from demons like you!

222
00:23:18,520 --> 00:23:19,680
Fuck off!

223
00:23:36,280 --> 00:23:37,160
Dad!

224
00:23:37,160 --> 00:23:38,040
Dad!

225
00:23:46,240 --> 00:23:46,920
You!

226
00:23:46,920 --> 00:23:48,200
That one’s not a ghost!

227
00:23:48,560 --> 00:23:49,640
Go get him!

228
00:23:51,280 --> 00:23:51,960
Come!

229
00:23:51,960 --> 00:23:52,840
Sin!

230
00:24:07,160 --> 00:24:08,080
Let me go!

231
00:24:10,720 --> 00:24:12,440
Dad!

232
00:24:23,920 --> 00:24:25,240
Still not afraid?

233
00:24:26,680 --> 00:24:27,520
Fine.

234
00:24:32,520 --> 00:24:33,160
Dad!

235
00:24:56,160 --> 00:24:57,360
Khun Yai!

236
00:25:01,520 --> 00:25:02,960
Khun Yai!

237
00:25:03,240 --> 00:25:05,320
Khun Yai!

238
00:25:06,160 --> 00:25:07,160
Get off me!

239
00:25:08,160 --> 00:25:09,160
- Khun Yai!
- Khun Yai!

240
00:25:09,200 --> 00:25:09,760
Khun Yai!

241
00:25:09,760 --> 00:25:10,560
Khun Yai!

242
00:25:11,920 --> 00:25:12,720
Khun Yai!

243
00:25:13,920 --> 00:25:14,960
Khun Yai!

244
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:15,800
Khun Yai!

245
00:25:15,880 --> 00:25:16,680
Khun Yai!

246
00:25:17,200 --> 00:25:17,680
Khun Yai!

247
00:25:17,680 --> 00:25:20,320
Saen…tell everyone to run away.

248
00:25:20,680 --> 00:25:21,680
No, sir!

249
00:25:23,400 --> 00:25:24,320
Saen!

250
00:25:25,000 --> 00:25:27,240
I’ve never disobeyed your order, Khun Phra Nai.

251
00:25:27,520 --> 00:25:29,240
But this time, I must do it.

252
00:25:33,800 --> 00:25:38,760
You scumbag! You dare hurt Chao Meun Samur Jairatch!

253
00:25:39,120 --> 00:25:40,640
You shall go to hell!

254
00:25:41,680 --> 00:25:42,480
Don’t!

255
00:25:42,560 --> 00:25:45,200
So stubborn. Eat this!

256
00:25:52,560 --> 00:25:53,400
Dad!

257
00:25:53,880 --> 00:25:55,560
Let me go!

258
00:26:08,520 --> 00:26:09,840
Dad!

259
00:26:10,440 --> 00:26:11,560
Let me go!

260
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:25,640
Did Kaewta ask you to do this?

261
00:26:27,880 --> 00:26:30,920
You and I, we’ve never had a dispute.

262
00:26:30,960 --> 00:26:32,720
It’s because you meddle with Kaewta’s life first.

263
00:26:33,440 --> 00:26:36,960
Ghosts should only stay with ghosts. I have to protect Kaewta!

264
00:26:37,880 --> 00:26:39,160
Protect him?

265
00:26:50,600 --> 00:26:53,800
Khun Yai, don’t waste your time negotiating with them!

266
00:26:53,800 --> 00:26:54,880
Stop, Saen!

267
00:26:56,960 --> 00:27:00,280
Kaew probably forgets about me by now.

268
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:07,880
Please hang in there, Khun Yai.

269
00:27:08,960 --> 00:27:10,600
Wait for me.

270
00:27:12,160 --> 00:27:13,240
No way.

271
00:27:14,640 --> 00:27:16,320
Khun Kaew will never forget about you.

272
00:27:17,600 --> 00:27:20,320
He will remember it soon.

273
00:27:21,400 --> 00:27:22,320
Forget about what?

274
00:27:23,840 --> 00:27:25,680
Do you and Kaew know each other?

275
00:27:29,080 --> 00:27:33,560
In the past life, Khun Kaew and Khun Yai were lovers.

276
00:27:35,280 --> 00:27:36,640
Lovers?

277
00:27:39,600 --> 00:27:42,200
Yes, lovers.

278
00:27:43,240 --> 00:27:45,040
Now that you know, you should leave.

279
00:27:45,560 --> 00:27:46,920
Don’t interfere with our affairs!

280
00:27:47,600 --> 00:27:48,640
Get out!

281
00:27:53,840 --> 00:27:54,640
I can’t do that.

282
00:27:55,920 --> 00:27:57,680
Humans and ghosts live in a different world.

283
00:27:58,320 --> 00:27:59,880
How can they be together?

284
00:28:00,800 --> 00:28:03,840
Doing this…don’t you think you’re being selfish?

285
00:28:04,880 --> 00:28:06,960
You should let it go.

286
00:28:07,960 --> 00:28:11,760
Take your people’s spirits back to where they belong and go reincarnate.

287
00:28:13,360 --> 00:28:15,000
If you don’t let them go first,

288
00:28:15,680 --> 00:28:17,600
they won’t be able to leave you.

289
00:28:18,680 --> 00:28:20,360
Stop talking rubbish!

290
00:28:20,920 --> 00:28:22,480
You will never understand him!

291
00:28:23,760 --> 00:28:25,520
If you still refuse to listen,

292
00:28:26,920 --> 00:28:28,800
I’m afraid I’ll have to do this.

293
00:28:32,280 --> 00:28:33,400
Khun Yai!

294
00:28:33,400 --> 00:28:34,280
Khun Yai!

295
00:28:36,640 --> 00:28:37,480
What are you gonna do?

296
00:28:37,480 --> 00:28:39,640
What are you gonna do?

297
00:28:47,080 --> 00:28:50,000
I’ll never let you hurt my people again!

298
00:28:54,360 --> 00:28:55,640
Khun Yai, please stop!

299
00:28:56,320 --> 00:28:59,440
If you keep doing that, your spirit might be lost forever!

300
00:29:01,000 --> 00:29:02,560
If Kaew has already forgotten about me,

301
00:29:04,520 --> 00:29:08,000
I’d rather have my soul disappeared forever.

302
00:29:08,720 --> 00:29:10,120
No, no!

303
00:29:11,960 --> 00:29:13,360
Without me…

304
00:29:15,160 --> 00:29:17,480
all of you will finally be free from this place.

305
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:19,640
And go on your own ways.

306
00:29:26,800 --> 00:29:27,880
This way…

307
00:29:29,880 --> 00:29:30,920
…is best for all of us.

308
00:29:31,880 --> 00:29:32,680
Khun Yai!

309
00:29:48,320 --> 00:29:49,480
Khun Yai!

310
00:29:49,480 --> 00:29:51,520
Let me go!

311
00:30:02,120 --> 00:30:03,760
Die!

312
00:30:13,480 --> 00:30:14,600
Die!

313
00:30:22,720 --> 00:30:23,800
Stop!

314
00:30:28,920 --> 00:30:30,200
Khun Yai.

315
00:30:40,120 --> 00:30:41,640
Don’t hurt them!

316
00:30:42,400 --> 00:30:43,840
You all can go to hell!

317
00:30:45,320 --> 00:30:46,360
Don’t!

318
00:30:46,560 --> 00:30:47,400
Don’t!

319
00:30:50,280 --> 00:30:52,040
- What are you doing?
 - Stop!

320
00:30:53,720 --> 00:30:54,880
Chai.

321
00:30:56,800 --> 00:30:59,160
Please don’t hurt Khun Yai and everyone here.

322
00:31:00,400 --> 00:31:01,400
Kaew…

323
00:31:02,400 --> 00:31:04,560
But these people can hurt you.

324
00:31:04,960 --> 00:31:06,600
Please take your men back.

325
00:31:07,800 --> 00:31:08,640
But Kaew…

326
00:31:09,320 --> 00:31:11,120
I’m begging you.

327
00:31:25,360 --> 00:31:26,520
You can go now.

328
00:31:28,560 --> 00:31:29,360
Go!

329
00:31:32,320 --> 00:31:34,360
Guys, let’s go.

330
00:31:39,600 --> 00:31:43,320
Dad, Khun Yai, Dad, Dad!

331
00:31:43,520 --> 00:31:44,320
Dad.

332
00:31:44,600 --> 00:31:45,360
- Saen!
 - Dad!

333
00:31:45,360 --> 00:31:47,360
Khun Yai! Khun Yai.

334
00:31:47,360 --> 00:31:48,080
Khun Yai!

335
00:31:48,760 --> 00:31:49,560
Khun Yai!

336
00:31:51,560 --> 00:31:53,200
Are you all right, Khun Yai?

337
00:31:55,080 --> 00:31:56,320
Kaew.

338
00:31:58,400 --> 00:32:00,000
You finally came back to me?

339
00:32:03,200 --> 00:32:05,120
Are you hurt anywhere?

340
00:32:11,040 --> 00:32:12,920
You remember me now, don’t you?

341
00:32:16,480 --> 00:32:17,280
Not yet.

342
00:32:21,920 --> 00:32:26,560
But I will. I promise you.

343
00:32:29,560 --> 00:32:31,400
Can you wait for me?

344
00:32:37,240 --> 00:32:41,880
Yes, I’ll always wait for you.

345
00:32:53,680 --> 00:32:55,520
Khun Yai…Khun Yai!

346
00:32:57,120 --> 00:32:59,320
Sin, please take me to see Khun Yai.

347
00:32:59,360 --> 00:33:00,160
Let’s go.

348
00:33:00,680 --> 00:33:01,480
Kaew!

349
00:33:03,440 --> 00:33:04,240
Ruedee!

350
00:33:04,640 --> 00:33:07,400
Luangta Cham asked me to give you this.

351
00:33:09,400 --> 00:33:11,160
Miss Ruedee, I’ll go check on Khun Yai first.

352
00:33:28,720 --> 00:33:30,920
Give it to Kaew, in case he wants to know.

353
00:33:39,040 --> 00:33:41,080
But only until a stick of incense is burnt out.

354
00:34:01,280 --> 00:34:02,080
Kaew.

355
00:34:04,440 --> 00:34:05,840
Can you not find out about it?

356
00:34:07,640 --> 00:34:09,679
Even though you and him used to be lovers,

357
00:34:11,760 --> 00:34:13,840
you two now live in a different world.

358
00:34:17,239 --> 00:34:19,679
You’ve reincarnated as another man.

359
00:34:21,199 --> 00:34:24,719
What good would it do to find out about your past life?

360
00:34:27,840 --> 00:34:28,800
Yes, it would.

361
00:34:32,040 --> 00:34:40,239
At least, it might help ease off this indescribable pain in my heart.

362
00:35:00,280 --> 00:35:01,560
Go ahead, Khun Kaew.

363
00:35:06,720 --> 00:35:07,520
Let's go out.

364
00:37:14,360 --> 00:37:16,000
Geez, Kaew.

365
00:37:16,840 --> 00:37:18,360
What’s wrong with you?

366
00:37:21,160 --> 00:37:22,840
I’m sorry, Uncle.

367
00:37:23,800 --> 00:37:28,360
If Kaew can’t focus like this, let’s just postpone the practice to another time.

368
00:37:29,280 --> 00:37:33,440
Maybe…because there’re too many people here.

369
00:37:34,160 --> 00:37:36,600
Good idea. Let’s take a break then.

370
00:37:36,600 --> 00:37:39,760
So that I can discuss some business with Khun Phra Nai.

371
00:37:39,920 --> 00:37:42,280
Don’t worry, sir. I’m not in a hurry.

372
00:37:43,040 --> 00:37:47,320
But my dancer seems to have lost his spirit already.

373
00:37:48,600 --> 00:37:49,640
Kaew.

374
00:37:50,600 --> 00:37:52,160
You will be punished.

375
00:38:30,600 --> 00:38:32,320
What is he looking at?

376
00:38:39,920 --> 00:38:41,200
Lady Chuichai!

377
00:38:41,200 --> 00:38:42,360
Move!

378
00:38:46,320 --> 00:38:47,800
Lady Chuichai!

379
00:38:49,680 --> 00:38:50,960
A man?

380
00:38:52,280 --> 00:38:56,600
Or is he still wondering if I’m a woman?

381
00:38:57,560 --> 00:39:01,840
How upsetting! I got punished because of him.

382
00:39:09,920 --> 00:39:12,520
How could he still smile after getting someone into trouble?

383
00:39:14,880 --> 00:39:15,920
Khun Phra,

384
00:39:17,240 --> 00:39:21,320
I think we should be very careful when it comes to something important like this.

385
00:39:22,240 --> 00:39:24,840
Yes, sir. I’ll have a thorough check on it again.

386
00:39:24,840 --> 00:39:26,760
Good.

387
00:39:27,560 --> 00:39:30,800
Kaew, are you done wiping?

388
00:39:32,040 --> 00:39:33,640
Yes, Uncle.

389
00:39:34,520 --> 00:39:38,400
Go tell the servant to prepare some refreshments for Khun Phra Nai.

390
00:39:39,840 --> 00:39:40,840
Yes, sir.

391
00:39:41,520 --> 00:39:43,080
Come, let’s get going then.

392
00:39:43,480 --> 00:39:44,280
Yes.

393
00:40:15,760 --> 00:40:17,800
Khun Yai! Khun Yai!

394
00:40:18,880 --> 00:40:21,280
Kaew! Why did you do that?

395
00:40:21,440 --> 00:40:24,960
I didn’t mean it, sir. My hand just slipped.

396
00:40:29,640 --> 00:40:33,240
I’m fine, sir. Kaew didn’t mean it. Please don’t blame him.

397
00:40:34,000 --> 00:40:37,280
Kaew, go fetch him some medicine now.

398
00:40:39,920 --> 00:40:40,880
Yes, sir.

399
00:40:48,760 --> 00:40:51,240
You lot can go home now.

400
00:41:28,520 --> 00:41:30,080
My apologies, sir.

401
00:41:31,400 --> 00:41:34,200
Don’t worry. You didn’t mean it.

402
00:41:37,080 --> 00:41:41,120
So, where are your servants, Khun Phra Nai?

403
00:41:44,000 --> 00:41:45,360
Please call me by my name.

404
00:41:48,600 --> 00:41:49,920
How could I?

405
00:41:50,880 --> 00:41:51,680
Sure, you can.

406
00:41:52,240 --> 00:41:54,120
We aren’t strangers.

407
00:41:54,720 --> 00:41:58,200
You’re an adopted son of Luang Sanor, the man I respect.

408
00:41:58,680 --> 00:42:02,240
So, we’re acquaintances.

409
00:42:27,080 --> 00:42:29,560
I wonder where Saen’s gone fooling around.

410
00:42:35,640 --> 00:42:37,480
But this is exactly how it should be.

411
00:42:40,640 --> 00:42:42,280
How so?

412
00:42:46,600 --> 00:42:48,680
You made me get hurt.

413
00:42:49,680 --> 00:42:51,320
So, you must be responsible for it.

414
00:42:52,240 --> 00:42:53,360
That’s how it should be.

415
00:43:02,440 --> 00:43:06,440
You probably feel better now. Please excuse me then.

416
00:43:42,200 --> 00:43:47,080
What are you prying on?

417
00:43:50,320 --> 00:43:51,200
Are you all right?

418
00:43:53,000 --> 00:43:55,640
It’s your fault. You gave me a fright.

419
00:43:56,080 --> 00:43:59,880
How could you blame it on me? You fell off on your own.

420
00:44:01,600 --> 00:44:03,320
That’s because you came near me.

421
00:44:04,080 --> 00:44:06,960
I got surprised, and then I…

422
00:44:10,760 --> 00:44:11,640
Ruedee!

423
00:44:13,200 --> 00:44:14,000
Kaew!

424
00:44:17,360 --> 00:44:18,720
How is it going?

425
00:44:20,120 --> 00:44:21,200
All good now.

426
00:44:22,600 --> 00:44:23,800
Let’s go.

427
00:44:24,400 --> 00:44:25,200
Yes!

428
00:44:40,000 --> 00:44:40,960
Ouch!

429
00:44:42,800 --> 00:44:44,240
That was quite a blow, Saen.

430
00:44:45,240 --> 00:44:46,680
Does it still hurt?

431
00:44:49,320 --> 00:44:50,360
Geez.

432
00:44:50,560 --> 00:44:52,080
It probably doesn’t hurt that much.

433
00:45:00,320 --> 00:45:02,840
Look at all that smiley face despite getting punched.

434
00:45:03,200 --> 00:45:04,680
Doesn’t it hurt, Khun Yai?

435
00:45:05,920 --> 00:45:06,880
Who’s hurt?

436
00:45:07,360 --> 00:45:08,480
Brother!

437
00:45:11,520 --> 00:45:12,600
Sophee.

438
00:45:15,640 --> 00:45:17,360
Are you back?

439
00:45:21,760 --> 00:45:22,640
Oh dear.

440
00:45:23,480 --> 00:45:25,400
Did you get into a fight with anyone?

441
00:45:26,040 --> 00:45:30,080
Oh, it’s nothing. I was being careless.

442
00:45:30,520 --> 00:45:32,000
I…

443
00:45:33,240 --> 00:45:35,640
I bumped my face against a pole at Luang Sanor’s place.

444
00:45:36,400 --> 00:45:37,360
A pole?

445
00:45:38,160 --> 00:45:40,800
But the bruise looks more like you were punched, sir.

446
00:45:43,600 --> 00:45:47,040
Hmm, you seem to be an expert in this.

447
00:45:47,760 --> 00:45:51,240
Perhaps, is it because you often get into a fight?
That’s why you can tell it apart.

448
00:45:52,280 --> 00:45:52,760
You!

449
00:45:52,760 --> 00:45:53,920
It’s Saen.

450
00:45:55,200 --> 00:45:56,000
Som.

451
00:46:00,920 --> 00:46:03,040
Do you want me to tend to the wound for you?

452
00:46:03,800 --> 00:46:05,320
Som, fetch me the first-aid kit.

453
00:46:05,480 --> 00:46:06,840
Oh, it’s all right.

454
00:46:08,440 --> 00:46:10,360
I already took care of it at Luang Sanor’s place.

455
00:46:11,360 --> 00:46:12,280
Let’s go, Saen.

456
00:46:12,280 --> 00:46:13,520
Wait.

457
00:46:15,720 --> 00:46:20,320
You seem to go to Luang Sanor’s place quite often lately. Is there something going on?

458
00:46:23,400 --> 00:46:25,880
I’ve been assigned to work on a project with him.

459
00:46:26,320 --> 00:46:27,920
So, we have some discussion to make.

460
00:46:28,360 --> 00:46:32,920
I see. That’s why you hardly have time for me.

461
00:46:34,240 --> 00:46:35,360
I’m afraid so.

462
00:46:39,920 --> 00:46:42,640
Perhaps, is there something you want from me, Sophee?

463
00:46:59,120 --> 00:47:00,400
So pretty, Som.

464
00:47:00,440 --> 00:47:01,440
Me, Miss?

465
00:47:01,440 --> 00:47:03,320
- The umbrella.
- Oh, yes, Miss.

466
00:47:06,000 --> 00:47:08,000
There are only beautiful things here.

467
00:47:09,160 --> 00:47:11,680
This one also looks perfect for you, Miss.

468
00:47:16,280 --> 00:47:18,680
Oh, look at that, Miss!

469
00:47:23,080 --> 00:47:24,280
So beautiful!

470
00:47:30,600 --> 00:47:31,880
It's so beautiful, som.

471
00:47:31,880 --> 00:47:33,600
I completely agree.

472
00:47:42,800 --> 00:47:48,000
Thank you, Brother. If it weren’t for you, Father would’ve never let me come here.

473
00:47:49,120 --> 00:47:51,640
It’s quite relaxing to be out and hanging around like this.

474
00:47:52,320 --> 00:47:53,200
Yes.

475
00:47:54,440 --> 00:47:57,040
I’m glad that you’re happy.

476
00:47:59,200 --> 00:48:00,160
Yes.

477
00:48:05,120 --> 00:48:06,160
Som.

478
00:48:06,240 --> 00:48:07,040
Yes, Miss?

479
00:48:07,160 --> 00:48:08,160
Look at this.

480
00:48:09,280 --> 00:48:11,360
It suits you very well, Miss.

481
00:48:12,320 --> 00:48:13,520
This one is also pretty.

482
00:48:24,440 --> 00:48:26,840
Where on earth are Kan and Ruedee?

483
00:48:30,720 --> 00:48:32,640
Isn’t that Lady Chuichai, sir?

484
00:48:42,760 --> 00:48:43,880
Kaewta.

485
00:48:48,320 --> 00:48:49,120
Saen.

486
00:48:49,120 --> 00:48:49,680
Yes, sir?

487
00:48:49,720 --> 00:48:51,600
- Keep watch here.
- Yes, sir.

488
00:48:54,200 --> 00:48:55,640
Will he get away with it though?

489
00:48:59,400 --> 00:49:02,680
This one looks pretty too, Lady Sophee. How about this one?

490
00:49:02,680 --> 00:49:04,280
Yes, Miss.

491
00:49:04,400 --> 00:49:05,440
This one on the right, Miss.

492
00:49:05,800 --> 00:49:07,320
Yes, that’s perfect.

493
00:49:13,400 --> 00:49:15,280
Where are those two?

494
00:49:24,720 --> 00:49:25,920
Khun Phra Nai.

495
00:49:27,960 --> 00:49:28,920
Kaewta.

[Next Episode]
When krathongs float side-by-side like this, they say that...

501
00:50:12,600 --> 00:50:15,360
...if it's a loving couple, their love will last forever.

502
00:50:15,360 --> 00:50:18,240
It's not strange for the krathongs to float side-by-side.

503
00:50:19,960 --> 00:50:21,880
We launched them from the same spot.

504
00:50:21,880 --> 00:50:25,520
Then why did you leave immediately when you saw I came to find you?

505
00:50:25,520 --> 00:50:27,960
Didn't Khun Yai come to discuss business with my uncle?

506
00:50:27,960 --> 00:50:31,760
But perhaps business is just an excuse... to let me come and see you. Don't you know that?

507
00:50:31,760 --> 00:50:37,120
I knows you've grown up and have your own thoughts and judgment

508
00:50:37,120 --> 00:50:39,880
But I still wants you to be cautious

509
00:50:39,880 --> 00:50:44,280
Don't let your heart stray beyond what is proper

510
00:50:44,280 --> 00:50:47,600
Otherwise, you will make a mistake and regret it

511
00:51:04,120 --> 00:51:06,880
The plot for EP 6, wow, will they find out?

512
00:51:06,960 --> 00:51:09,680
Isn't it the moment where you'll know the truth?

513
00:51:09,680 --> 00:51:14,400
-The investigation into what this
room is has begun.
-They've started to suspect.

514
00:51:14,680 --> 00:51:17,160
So, I drugged him.

515
00:51:17,280 --> 00:51:20,720
-Oh, because Sin usually guards it, so you just knocked him out.
-Yes.

516
00:51:20,720 --> 00:51:24,800
-And did you find it this time?
-Was he drugged in the next episode? I'm not sure.

517
00:51:24,800 --> 00:51:27,880
I was stunned. It was unexpected.

518
00:51:28,040 --> 00:51:30,080
It felt... not right.

519
00:51:30,120 --> 00:51:33,120
-Not right?
-It was like, "Hey!"

520
00:51:33,480 --> 00:51:36,520
Was all the food I've eaten just my imagination?

521
00:51:36,680 --> 00:51:38,000
The food you made for me.

522
00:51:39,320 --> 00:51:41,560
But maybe you saw something else?

523
00:51:41,560 --> 00:51:44,040
But I saw chili paste with mackerel.

524
00:51:44,040 --> 00:51:46,040
-Yes, actually...
-When I was eating, it might have been worms.

525
00:51:46,040 --> 00:51:49,320
Exactly. It was actually rocks.
I was cooking in the kitchen with Nom Yaem.

526
00:51:49,320 --> 00:51:51,720
See? It's always like this.

527
00:51:51,760 --> 00:51:55,960
So I... was shocked, thought I was tricked.

528
00:51:56,240 --> 00:51:59,280
Yeah, you were actually tricked, but it's okay.

529
00:51:59,560 --> 00:52:01,240
Allowing him to trick you means you love him.

530
00:52:01,400 --> 00:52:04,400
See, it's always like that.

531
00:52:06,200 --> 00:52:07,040
I won't allow it.

532
00:52:07,040 --> 00:52:09,440
Okay, let's find out! Let's go!

533
00:52:12,960 --> 00:52:14,480
Sin, wake up!

534
00:52:17,600 --> 00:52:19,120
Sin, wake up!

535
00:52:20,120 --> 00:52:22,920
[Too late. Kaewta walks past Sin.]

536
00:52:23,520 --> 00:52:25,880
[Slowly opens the door and descends.]

537
00:52:27,520 --> 00:52:29,080
[Walking down]

538
00:52:29,360 --> 00:52:30,960
[Walking down]

[Billy stands up and walks away]

541
00:52:45,120 --> 00:52:48,520
We're safe, we're outside now. Come on, hurry!

542
00:52:49,160 --> 00:52:50,320
Come outside quickly!

543
00:52:51,760 --> 00:52:52,680
Phew.

544
00:52:53,440 --> 00:52:55,960
This is a really tormenting location.

545
00:52:56,800 --> 00:53:01,240
I hope this is the...

546
00:53:02,360 --> 00:53:05,440
second most difficult thing,
after wearing the traditional dance outfit.

547
00:53:06,000 --> 00:53:09,400
[This must be a good story,
because these are good stories.]

548
00:53:09,640 --> 00:53:13,720
This is a fortress.

549
00:53:13,960 --> 00:53:18,680
Back in the day during wars,
this place was used for positioning cannons.

550
00:53:19,120 --> 00:53:22,040
And it seems to be an air-raid shelter too.

551
00:53:22,240 --> 00:53:24,840
And this here is a walkway

552
00:53:25,320 --> 00:53:29,040
but we put a barrier to make it look like an underground area.

553
00:53:30,720 --> 00:53:33,280
And there are other setups and things.

554
00:53:33,600 --> 00:53:37,720
So, we could only enter and exit through one narrow way.

555
00:53:38,320 --> 00:53:39,640
The door is this small.

556
00:53:40,200 --> 00:53:43,480
And we had to carry cameras and equipment inside.

557
00:53:45,720 --> 00:53:46,360
It's so stuffy.

558
00:53:47,080 --> 00:53:49,320
Like roasted chicken.

559
00:53:50,600 --> 00:53:54,200
But it's good that it's not sunny outside anymore.

560
00:53:54,640 --> 00:53:56,640
It's still hot inside anyway.

561
00:53:57,840 --> 00:54:01,760
Wait and see the next scene. It's not over yet.

562
00:54:03,840 --> 00:54:04,920
Kaewta.

563
00:54:05,520 --> 00:54:06,440
Kaewta.

564
00:54:06,560 --> 00:54:07,600
Kaew!!

565
00:54:13,720 --> 00:54:14,600
Kaew!

566
00:54:19,640 --> 00:54:22,160
Kaew!

567
00:54:24,240 --> 00:54:25,840
I'll take you to see.

568
00:54:32,000 --> 00:54:34,400
Oh, don't cry. I already let you hug me.

569
00:54:40,200 --> 00:54:41,480
As you can see.

570
00:54:41,680 --> 00:54:43,320
I haven't even spoken yet.

571
00:54:46,440 --> 00:54:48,160
You're going to cry again.

572
00:54:49,080 --> 00:54:50,240
Well done.

573
00:54:50,400 --> 00:54:52,160
-This scene is the saddest.
-Yes.

574
00:54:52,240 --> 00:54:57,000
Because he has been waiting for a hundred years.

575
00:54:57,520 --> 00:55:00,720
I thought this was the moment he would remember.

576
00:55:00,720 --> 00:55:02,960
But it turned out he was afraid of me.

577
00:55:03,280 --> 00:55:06,320
And ran away from my life, so...

578
00:55:08,360 --> 00:55:11,240
Seeing that, I was shocked.

579
00:55:11,240 --> 00:55:13,520
I was just shocked.

580
00:55:13,520 --> 00:55:16,400
-Being haunted by a ghost.
-I only went out for a moment.

581
00:55:17,000 --> 00:55:19,600
-You didn't tell me you were running to the convenience store.
-Look at my snot.

582
00:55:20,520 --> 00:55:23,120
Kaew! Buy me some matcha too.

583
00:55:23,480 --> 00:55:25,480
Look at my snot.

584
00:55:25,880 --> 00:55:27,640
-Tissue?
-Yes.

585
00:55:28,280 --> 00:55:31,600
Kaew, why didn't you tell me you were going to buy matcha?

586
00:55:31,600 --> 00:55:34,000
That's it everyone. Let's go home.

587
00:55:34,000 --> 00:55:35,200
Bye-bye.
