69
00:07:35,288 --> 00:07:42,467
In the painting, there are two moons,
one has a rabbit, the other doesn't.

70
00:07:42,467 --> 00:07:46,573
I think it's meant to show that
there are two kinds of people in the world.

71
00:07:46,573 --> 00:07:52,327
Those who believe there's a rabbit on the moon,
and those who don't.

and spaceship wrecks?

Maybe it's more about imagination
versus no imagination?

76
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:14,018
Yeah, maybe.
That's probably why it's called Question.

77
00:08:14,018 --> 00:08:19,093
I guess it's asking what kind of person you are.

00:08:21,480 --> 00:08:24,120
So... what kind are you?

00:20:56,280 --> 00:21:00,087
Hello, Miss Pitcha.
Miss Plearn is waiting for you inside.

180
00:21:06,560 --> 00:21:08,367
This way, please.

181
00:21:14,147 --> 00:21:15,727
- Plearn.
- Yeah?

182
00:21:15,727 --> 00:21:18,393
Wow, every room is full of students, amazing!

183
00:21:18,393 --> 00:21:22,573
I'll need to open two more branches
in time for exam season.

184
00:21:22,573 --> 00:21:25,520
Whoa, can you handle that?

185
00:21:25,520 --> 00:21:28,393
I'll have to. I need help though.

186
00:21:28,393 --> 00:21:31,173
Honestly, I need to open ten more branches.

187
00:21:31,173 --> 00:21:34,993
Every parent wants their kid to be number one.

188
00:21:36,085 --> 00:21:38,920
But only one kid can actually be number one,
right?

189
00:21:38,920 --> 00:21:42,047
Parents are so pressuring.

190
00:21:42,047 --> 00:21:46,580
Kids who are competitive love it though,
there are tons of them.

191
00:21:46,580 --> 00:21:47,933
Kids like you, Plearn.

192
00:21:47,933 --> 00:21:49,293
Look at this.

193
00:21:49,293 --> 00:21:50,593
Look.

194
00:21:50,593 --> 00:21:54,780
Honor rolls, certificates, your room is filled.
It's insane.

195
00:21:55,967 --> 00:22:00,240
And this is exactly why Mom doesn't love you.

196
00:22:00,240 --> 00:22:02,393
So this is why you called me to help, huh?

197
00:22:02,393 --> 00:22:03,833
Well, I'm not helping anymore. I'm annoyed now.

198
00:22:03,833 --> 00:22:06,847
Oh, my dear little sister, sit down.

199
00:22:07,613 --> 00:22:10,960
What now? What do you want?

200
00:22:10,960 --> 00:22:13,887
Actually, I want to do a pre-wedding photo shoot.

201
00:22:13,887 --> 00:22:17,360
Find me a gorgeous, unseen location, please.

202
00:22:17,360 --> 00:22:21,287
I want water flowing in front, mountains behind.

203
00:22:21,287 --> 00:22:25,833
Just like the feng shui master said.

204
00:22:26,920 --> 00:22:29,013
Feng shui for a grave site, maybe?

205
00:22:29,013 --> 00:22:31,500
Hey! Watch it.

206
00:22:31,500 --> 00:22:33,833
Water in front symbolizes peace.

207
00:22:33,833 --> 00:22:35,887
Mountains in the back mean stability.

208
00:22:35,887 --> 00:22:41,213
If this photo hangs in my home,
it'll be the best feng shui ever.

209
00:22:41,213 --> 00:22:43,967
Come on, just find me a place. It won't take long.

210
00:22:43,967 --> 00:22:46,393
But a view like that,
don't we have to go upcountry?

211
00:22:46,393 --> 00:22:49,347
Will Laks be okay with that?

212
00:22:49,347 --> 00:22:54,604
He's fine with anything.
He lets me make all the decisions. He spoils me.

213
00:22:54,604 --> 00:22:57,573
Spoils or ignores you?

214
00:22:57,573 --> 00:22:59,020
Hey!

215
00:22:59,740 --> 00:23:02,853
Jealous much? Or just bitter at life?

216
00:23:02,853 --> 00:23:05,160
I hate having an older sister.

217
00:23:05,160 --> 00:23:06,753
Why?

218
00:23:08,253 --> 00:23:11,020
Too much pressure.

219
00:23:11,020 --> 00:23:13,246
Constant comparisons.

220
00:23:13,246 --> 00:23:16,753
It's like a caste system.

221
00:23:16,753 --> 00:23:19,873
I'm the untouchable.

222
00:23:20,813 --> 00:23:23,820
So your sister's really that good, huh?

223
00:23:24,487 --> 00:23:26,287
Do you have siblings?

224
00:23:27,269 --> 00:23:28,593
I'm the eldest.

225
00:23:29,813 --> 00:23:33,253
- Ah, one of those perfect older siblings.
- Hey now.

226
00:23:33,253 --> 00:23:35,287
Why is that?

227
00:23:40,347 --> 00:23:42,233
That's what Grandma used to say.

228
00:23:42,233 --> 00:23:46,973
Older siblings take care, younger ones whine.

229
00:23:48,047 --> 00:23:50,165
My sibling doesn't love me either.

230
00:23:50,165 --> 00:23:52,445
Probably thinks the same way you do.

231
00:23:53,207 --> 00:23:55,920
Even though I'm not that perfect.

232
00:24:01,400 --> 00:24:07,693
Do you think parents
love all their children equally?

233
00:24:14,613 --> 00:24:17,060
Do you love your parents equally?

234
00:24:28,947 --> 00:24:33,233
You do, but in different ways, right?

235
00:24:34,387 --> 00:24:36,780
Different people, different kinds of love.

236
00:24:39,320 --> 00:24:41,093
I believe they love you.

237
00:24:41,093 --> 00:24:44,580
Just maybe differently
from how they love your sister.

238
00:24:55,073 --> 00:24:57,120
Good evening, listeners.

239
00:24:57,120 --> 00:24:59,640
Off work, where are you heading tonight?

240
00:24:59,640 --> 00:25:02,247
If you're unsure, I've got a recommendation.

241

The final day of the art exhibition by Kookkie,
a brilliant modern artist for the new generation.

242
00:25:06,267 --> 00:25:12,140
Beautiful, meaningful pieces, only until 9 PM.

243
00:25:12,140 --> 00:25:14,820
Oh right, I almost forgot.

244
00:25:14,820 --> 00:25:18,220
This next song is for the listener
who requested it earlier this afternoon.

245
00:25:18,220 --> 00:25:20,987
"I don't know who that person wants to meet,
but I hope that person meets them."

246
00:25:20,987 --> 00:25:24,060
Here's "Want to See You" by Blue Shade.

247
00:26:54,920 --> 00:26:59,947
I'll be the one
who believes there's a rabbit on the moon.

248
00:27:01,033 --> 00:27:06,840
Rabbits on the moon?
Come on, there's no air on the moon, you know.

250

Wait, someone already bought this?

[The Presence]

252
00:27:53,993 --> 00:27:59,393
- Hello?
- Hi, I'm Jack. I'm Anita's assistant.

253
00:28:18,280 --> 00:28:21,373
Hello, Jack. I'm Pitcha. How can I help you?

254
00:28:21,373 --> 00:28:24,627
Actually, I can speak Thai.

255
00:28:24,627 --> 00:28:26,828
And so can Anita.

256
00:28:26,828 --> 00:28:30,227
She used to work in Thailand
for nearly four years.

257
00:28:30,227 --> 00:28:36,907
Oh, I see.
I didn't realize Anita still speaks Thai.

258
00:28:36,907 --> 00:28:41,333
She hasn't been to Thailand in about two years.

259
00:28:41,333 --> 00:28:44,411
When we saw your properties, we got interested.

260
00:28:44,411 --> 00:28:46,827
We're currently considering two agents.

261
00:28:46,827 --> 00:28:49,400
So I'd like to get more details.

262
00:28:49,400 --> 00:28:51,800
How many days would it take,
which sites are included,

263
00:28:51,800 --> 00:28:54,487
and how do we travel around?

264
00:28:54,487 --> 00:28:56,937
Sure, I'll send it over shortly.

265
00:28:56,937 --> 00:28:59,227
Tentatively,
the trip would take seven to ten days.

266
00:28:59,227 --> 00:29:02,800
If Anita needs anything else,
don't hesitate to let me know.

267
00:29:02,800 --> 00:29:04,540
I'll take care of everything.

268
00:29:04,540 --> 00:29:08,027
Okay, thank you very much, Pitcha.

269
00:29:19,747 --> 00:29:23,040
I want to rent a car.
But I want to pick it out myself.

270
00:29:23,040 --> 00:29:25,967
My guest is VVIP, okay?

271
00:29:27,073 --> 00:29:28,740
Plew!

272
00:29:33,507 --> 00:29:38,093
Plew!

273
00:29:42,953 --> 00:29:46,340
Plew!

274
00:29:49,440 --> 00:29:51,180
Plew!

275
00:30:08,967 --> 00:30:10,107
Mom!

276
00:30:10,107 --> 00:30:11,073
- Mom...
- What is it?

277
00:30:11,073 --> 00:30:12,893
I did it!

278
00:30:12,893 --> 00:30:16,633
Did what, why are you yelling so loud
the neighbors can hear?

279
00:30:16,633 --> 00:30:18,900
Anita contacted me, Mom!

280
00:30:18,900 --> 00:30:20,167
Who?

281
00:30:20,167 --> 00:30:22,520
Anita! A major investor from China.

282
00:30:22,520 --> 00:30:25,567
She never goes out to view land
with anyone in Thailand.

283
00:30:26,267 --> 00:30:29,100
I thought you'd already given up on selling land.

284
00:30:29,100 --> 00:30:33,067
No, Mom! I'm not giving up.
She's huge, like, huge!

285
00:30:33,067 --> 00:30:36,833
If I close this deal,
I could be looking at hundreds of millions!

286
00:30:36,833 --> 00:30:39,520
So the other day when we talked,

287
00:30:39,520 --> 00:30:41,860
you weren't even thinking about what I said,
were you?

288
00:30:45,000 --> 00:30:50,927
Mom, I have my own life.
I have things I'm passionate about.

289
00:30:51,740 --> 00:30:56,737
I've always tried to understand you.
But nothing ever seems to happen.

290
00:30:56,737 --> 00:30:59,227
How old are you now?

291
00:30:59,227 --> 00:31:00,773
Huh?

292
00:31:00,773 --> 00:31:05,053
People your age already own their own businesses.

293
00:31:05,053 --> 00:31:06,400
And what about you?

294
00:31:06,400 --> 00:31:10,347
Still carrying that canvas bag,
selling stinky plots of land?

295
00:31:13,580 --> 00:31:15,407
Time...

296
00:31:15,407 --> 00:31:19,340
Time is the most valuable thing
a person can waste.

297
00:31:22,187 --> 00:31:24,873
Mom, please listen.

298
00:31:28,287 --> 00:31:31,333
I'll give you just three more months.

299
00:31:32,453 --> 00:31:38,553
If you don't make those hundreds of millions
like you claimed,

300
00:31:38,553 --> 00:31:42,380
you'll stop everything
and go work for your sister.

301
00:31:44,660 --> 00:31:50,380
You're almost 30 now. Time to stop playing around.

302
00:33:10,304 --> 00:33:13,320
This place is really beautiful.

303
00:33:13,320 --> 00:33:18,640
Thailand has so many beautiful islands,
but no one takes care of them properly.

304
00:33:18,640 --> 00:33:21,727
People just build whatever they want.

305
00:33:21,727 --> 00:33:25,513
Wastewater systems are a mess.

306
00:33:25,513 --> 00:33:29,177
That's true. I actually own a small plot myself.

307
00:33:29,177 --> 00:33:33,220
At first, my family wanted to sell it too.
But I refused.

308
00:33:33,220 --> 00:33:39,067
I just couldn't let go of some of the trees.
Silly, right?

309
00:33:39,067 --> 00:33:41,820
Not at all.

310
00:33:41,820 --> 00:33:44,080
Some people buy land
just because they love the trees or soil.

311
00:33:44,080 --> 00:33:45,246
Really?

312
00:33:46,293 --> 00:33:53,620
Honestly, I'm always happy when I meet people
who truly appreciate the value of beautiful land.

313
00:33:55,147 --> 00:34:01,660
It's so important
to preserve the beauty of our planet.

314
00:34:05,787 --> 00:34:07,940
You're awesome.

315
00:34:07,940 --> 00:34:10,470
Keep doing what you're doing.

316
00:34:10,470 --> 00:34:13,336
Not many people think that way anymore.

317
00:34:14,893 --> 00:34:17,700
Are you like, an environmentalist or something?

318
00:34:21,480 --> 00:34:23,480
Are you?

319
00:34:33,638 --> 00:34:36,278
You know,
we really should've exchanged LINE contacts.

320
00:34:56,075 --> 00:34:59,640
Mook, I'll come see you tomorrow.

321
00:34:59,640 --> 00:35:02,153
I want to send this proposal to China
as soon as possible.

322
00:35:03,853 --> 00:35:06,267
Okay, bye.

323

[Car Loft]
Limousine?

324
00:35:14,400 --> 00:35:17,840
It's just two people,
perfect for a luxurious impression.

325
00:35:17,840 --> 00:35:21,584
I don't think that's practical.
We're heading out of town too.

326
00:35:21,584 --> 00:35:24,683
What about a camper van?
Very trendy, I just finished one.

327
00:35:24,683 --> 00:35:27,167
Someone like her only stays in six-star hotels.

328
00:35:27,167 --> 00:35:30,373
Okay, fine, then it has to be a van.

329
00:35:30,373 --> 00:35:32,873
How many seats do you need?

330
00:35:32,873 --> 00:35:35,233
You're coming too, right?

331
00:35:35,233 --> 00:35:40,147
I have one that seats up to six. Super stylish.

332
00:35:40,147 --> 00:35:44,140
Yeah, a van it is. But get me a good driver, okay?

333
00:35:44,140 --> 00:35:45,987
Got it. I'll take care of it.

334
00:35:45,987 --> 00:35:48,759
When do you need it?

335
00:35:48,759 --> 00:35:52,627
I can't say yet.
I have to wait for her approval first.

336
00:35:52,627 --> 00:35:58,580
If she gives the go-ahead,
then I'll confirm with you.

337
00:35:58,580 --> 00:36:03,107
Wow, complicated.
Are you paying for everything yourself?

338
00:36:03,107 --> 00:36:06,633
If she buys the land, I'll just advance the cost.

339
00:36:06,633 --> 00:36:10,493
If not, maybe she'll cover half.

340
00:36:10,493 --> 00:36:12,020
I'll give you a special rate.

341
00:36:12,020 --> 00:36:14,020
Thank you so much!

342
00:36:14,020 --> 00:36:16,020
Let's go get coffee.

343
00:36:17,000 --> 00:36:18,853
Thanks.

344
00:36:18,853 --> 00:36:20,780
Thanks a lot.

345
00:36:21,493 --> 00:36:23,420
Just a second.

346
00:36:24,527 --> 00:36:26,227
Yes, Jack?

347
00:36:26,227 --> 00:36:31,687
You said I should let you know
if Anita needs anything extra, right?

348
00:36:31,687 --> 00:36:32,893
Yes?

349
00:36:33,820 --> 00:36:39,207
Well, Anita has a small request.

350
00:36:39,207 --> 00:36:46,500
If you can get in touch with a certain person,
she'll be very happy.

351
00:36:48,433 --> 00:36:51,533
Jay, the most famous host in Thailand?

352
00:36:51,533 --> 00:36:55,967
You mean, if I can get Jay,
she'll agree to come view the land?

353
00:36:55,967 --> 00:36:57,060
Yes.

354
00:36:57,060 --> 00:37:01,633
Okay then.
I'll take care of it and get back to you.

355
00:37:01,633 --> 00:37:04,967
Thank you so much, Pitcha.

356
00:37:10,540 --> 00:37:12,487
What the heck?

357
00:37:12,487 --> 00:37:17,053
Anita wants a host to come view the land with me.

358
00:37:17,053 --> 00:37:20,940
Oh my gosh, classy Chinese lady.

359
00:37:21,647 --> 00:37:24,440
Wait, what even is a host?

360
00:37:24,440 --> 00:37:27,547
What? You don't know?

361
00:37:27,547 --> 00:37:31,667
A host, like a bar host. A guy who entertains you.

362
00:37:31,667 --> 00:37:33,893
You buy drinks, he flirts.

363
00:37:33,893 --> 00:37:35,280
You mean a male escort?

364
00:37:35,280 --> 00:37:38,480
No, not like that.

365
00:37:38,480 --> 00:37:42,493
He just entertains you, makes you feel special.

366
00:37:42,493 --> 00:37:46,353
If things go further,
that's between the two people.

367
00:37:47,133 --> 00:37:53,927
These days, it's super trendy.
Women who are bored or lonely go to a host bar.

368
00:37:53,927 --> 00:37:59,200
They pay guys to take care of them,
like boyfriend vibes, then go their separate ways.

369
00:37:59,200 --> 00:38:01,200
Paying men to take care of you like that?

370
00:38:01,200 --> 00:38:04,993
Well, maybe it works
for people who don't have time for love.

371
00:38:04,993 --> 00:38:07,527
It's sweet, dreamy.

372
00:38:07,527 --> 00:38:13,937
The guys are good-looking, clean nails,
oil-free face, super attentive.

373
00:38:13,937 --> 00:38:17,213
- It's relaxing, really.
- Whoa, have you gone before?

374
00:38:17,213 --> 00:38:20,533
No, but a lot of my clients do.

375
00:38:20,533 --> 00:38:23,780
They like to rent my luxury cars
for the hosts to drive.

376
00:38:25,660 --> 00:38:30,287
So who did your VVIP guest request?

377
00:38:30,287 --> 00:38:32,880
A guy named Jay.
He's the most famous host in Thailand.

378
00:38:32,880 --> 00:38:35,520
Only takes VIP clients.
His wait list is a year long.

379
00:38:35,520 --> 00:38:36,520
[Thailand's No.1 Bar Host Jay,
Contact: Tiwa or Smile Bar]

380
00:38:36,520 --> 00:38:39,440
What is this? I'm confused.

381
00:38:40,416 --> 00:38:42,644
There's no photo either?

382
00:38:42,644 --> 00:38:49,047
Just says contact Tiwa or Smile Bar.

383
00:38:49,047 --> 00:38:51,753
So I have to go to a bar host?

384
00:38:51,753 --> 00:38:54,940
No way. I'm not doing this.

385
00:38:54,940 --> 00:38:57,453
If you don't go, someone else will.

386
00:38:57,453 --> 00:39:01,653
Didn't you say that
that Chinese lady only considers two agents?

387
00:39:01,653 --> 00:39:03,698
You'll miss your shot.

388
00:39:03,698 --> 00:39:05,200
You're right.

389
00:39:05,200 --> 00:39:06,760
Go now.

390
00:39:06,760 --> 00:39:10,787
You're on your own for this one,
I'm not coming with you.

392

Excuse me, I'd like to speak to someone about Jay.

393
00:39:48,380 --> 00:39:50,698
Jay's not in today.

394
00:39:50,698 --> 00:39:53,512
What? He's not working today?

395
00:39:55,666 --> 00:39:58,126
Hey Tiger, someone's asking for Jay.

396
00:40:02,473 --> 00:40:05,273
Hi there! Are you here to book Jay?

397
00:40:05,273 --> 00:40:10,267
Yes. Actually, I'm booking for a friend.

398
00:40:10,267 --> 00:40:12,213
Booking for a friend?

399
00:40:12,213 --> 00:40:17,173
Yes. A friend.
Does anyone have his contact number?

400
00:40:17,173 --> 00:40:18,807
Please wait a moment.

401
00:40:24,607 --> 00:40:26,760
Here, call this number.

[Tiva Teeraboonseth]

403
00:40:28,720 --> 00:40:32,893
That's Tiwa,
the only one who manages Jay's schedule.

404
00:40:32,893 --> 00:40:36,553
If you're lucky and have enough money,
you might get a slot.

405
00:40:36,553 --> 00:40:39,993
But if Jay's not available, I am.

406
00:40:39,993 --> 00:40:43,153
Hi, I'm Gur.

407
00:40:43,153 --> 00:40:45,820
Okay. Thanks.

408
00:40:47,950 --> 00:40:51,473
What the heck? I'm a top host too, you know.

409
00:40:51,473 --> 00:40:54,507
Forget it. Let's keep rehearsing. Go, go!

410
00:40:54,507 --> 00:40:56,340
Hey hey! Keep practicing!

00:40:56,340 --> 00:40:59,793
Hey hey!

412
00:40:59,793 --> 00:41:04,247
Tiwa, please help me today, it's my birthday.

413
00:41:04,247 --> 00:41:06,993
I just want to be extra happy today.

414
00:41:06,993 --> 00:41:09,227
I really can't fit you in.

415
00:41:09,227 --> 00:41:11,827
Jay's been booked solid three months in advance.

416
00:41:11,827 --> 00:41:16,053
I'll put you on the waiting list
and ask Jay what he wants to do.

417
00:41:18,373 --> 00:41:20,213
Hello, I'd like to check Jay's availability.

418
00:41:20,213 --> 00:41:23,153
- Oh, Miss Noeywan?
- No, it's Noeyhom this time.

419
00:41:23,153 --> 00:41:25,747
One moment, please.

420
00:41:25,747 --> 00:41:28,613
Hello, Tiwa speaking.

421
00:41:28,613 --> 00:41:31,533
Yes, this is Tiwa.
What can I help you with?

422
00:41:31,533 --> 00:41:34,040
Jay's schedule is completely full
starting next month.

423
00:41:34,040 --> 00:41:35,587
Like, really full.

424
00:41:35,587 --> 00:41:38,703
I'm working through his bookings now,
there are three or four people waiting.

425
00:41:38,703 --> 00:41:40,027
Please try again next time.

426
00:41:40,027 --> 00:41:41,933
- Yes, that's the correct response.
- Okay.

427
00:41:41,933 --> 00:41:46,000
- Twenty... Twenty.
- Twenty, wait...

428
00:41:46,000 --> 00:41:47,980
One moment, please.

429
00:41:49,299 --> 00:41:51,199
Yes.

430
00:41:51,199 --> 00:41:54,259
Coming here doesn't magically
get you a slot with Jay.

431
00:41:54,259 --> 00:41:56,746
If it's a no, it's a no.

432
00:41:56,746 --> 00:41:58,419
I'm sorry.

433
00:41:58,419 --> 00:42:00,641
Everything has been arranged just for today.

434
00:42:00,641 --> 00:42:01,972
- Twenty.
- So please, can you double-check for me?

435
00:42:01,972 --> 00:42:04,439
One moment.

436
00:42:04,439 --> 00:42:09,319
- I'm listening.
- I'm not asking for your guy to spoon-feed me.

437
00:42:09,319 --> 00:42:11,532
He's for a client of mine,
she wants to book ten full days.

438
00:42:11,532 --> 00:42:15,246
Do the math and decide,
are you really going to hang up on me?

439
00:42:15,246 --> 00:42:19,546
Or are you going to tell me where you are
so we can talk business?

440
00:42:19,546 --> 00:42:21,279
All-inclusive.

441
00:42:21,279 --> 00:42:22,359
Ten days.

442
00:42:22,359 --> 00:42:25,039
I'm still waiting.

443
00:42:25,039 --> 00:42:26,872
Okay?

444
00:42:26,872 --> 00:42:30,739
Hold on a sec, a big client just called.

445
00:42:30,739 --> 00:42:32,459
What?

446
00:42:33,832 --> 00:42:36,906
Hello, my dear Jay, what are you doing right now?

447
00:42:36,906 --> 00:42:40,359
Do you have a minute to swing by my café?

448
00:42:40,359 --> 00:42:42,406
I told you, I'm not free today.

449
00:42:42,406 --> 00:42:44,549
I know, but...

450
00:42:44,549 --> 00:42:46,339
Hear me out for a second...

451
00:42:50,559 --> 00:42:55,666
Mrs. Saisamorn Jaikhuenkaew,
please proceed to the exam room.

452
00:42:55,666 --> 00:42:59,339
Your turn.

453
00:43:00,446 --> 00:43:04,212
Your blood sugar levels aren't looking great.

454
00:43:04,212 --> 00:43:08,559
This means you haven't cut down on sweets
like I told you, have you?

455
00:43:09,486 --> 00:43:11,763
And your blood pressure is high.

456
00:43:11,763 --> 00:43:15,226
You should be careful,
it could come as a combo pack.

457
00:43:15,226 --> 00:43:18,706
High blood pressure, diabetes, heart problems.

458
00:43:18,706 --> 00:43:22,432
But it's durian season! My friend sent me some.

459
00:43:22,432 --> 00:43:24,312
Still, don't eat too much of it.

460
00:43:24,312 --> 00:43:27,579
Especially if it's premium Monthong
from Palau forest.

461
00:43:27,579 --> 00:43:32,432
Alright, I'm going to prescribe
one more medication.

462
00:43:32,432 --> 00:43:36,386
But from now on, I'll need you to come in
for blood tests every two weeks, okay?

463
00:43:36,386 --> 00:43:39,359
- What? Every two weeks? That's too much.
- Alright.

464
00:43:40,079 --> 00:43:43,899
Okay, in that case,
I'll go ahead and schedule your next appointment.

465
00:43:43,899 --> 00:43:47,038
These are your blood test results.

466
00:43:47,038 --> 00:43:50,866
- Alright then.
- And don't forget, please cut back on sweets.

467
00:43:50,866 --> 00:43:54,546
Durian isn't a sweet. It's a fruit, doctor.

468
00:43:54,546 --> 00:43:56,099
Thanks, Doc.

469
00:43:56,099 --> 00:43:57,879
Thank you very much.

470
00:44:07,866 --> 00:44:13,972
I think getting blood drawn once a month
is enough.

471
00:44:13,972 --> 00:44:15,080
Why?

472
00:44:15,080 --> 00:44:17,932
The doctor said every two weeks,
so let's stick with that.

473
00:44:17,932 --> 00:44:19,080
I feel bad.

474
00:44:19,080 --> 00:44:21,112
You're not even my kid,

475
00:44:21,112 --> 00:44:22,999
and yet you're the one taking me
to the doctor every month.

476
00:44:22,999 --> 00:44:26,212
I don't even know how to repay you.

477
00:44:27,179 --> 00:44:31,439
Just to be clear, I'm not some rich old lady
with a billion-baht inheritance.

478
00:44:31,439 --> 00:44:34,592
So if you're hoping to get something from me,
forget it.

479
00:44:34,592 --> 00:44:36,994
Wow, then I guess I'll go now.

480
00:44:36,994 --> 00:44:39,492
Goodbye, Aunt Samorn, the inheritance-less one.

481
00:44:39,492 --> 00:44:40,739
Hey!

482
00:44:45,786 --> 00:44:49,699
Thanks, dear. Thank you for taking care of me.

483
00:44:49,699 --> 00:44:51,507
Must be such a hassle.

484
00:44:51,507 --> 00:44:57,466
How many times do I have to tell you
it's not a hassle at all?

485
00:44:57,466 --> 00:44:59,706
If I don't take you, who will?

486
00:44:59,706 --> 00:45:02,539
You don't have any kids.

487
00:45:02,539 --> 00:45:05,779
If you really want to repay me,
cut down on the snacks.

488
00:45:08,159 --> 00:45:10,766
I'll make you some sour curry.

489
00:45:12,319 --> 00:45:14,679
Sour curry again?

490
00:45:14,679 --> 00:45:17,312
Didn't I just say to cut down on sweets?
Do you even listen?

491
00:45:27,292 --> 00:45:29,172
Yes?

492
00:45:29,172 --> 00:45:32,926
I should be done by evening.
If they can wait, let them.

493
00:45:32,926 --> 00:45:35,499
I seriously can't go any faster.

494
00:45:38,872 --> 00:45:41,953
They want to hire you
to take care of a Chinese VIP for ten days.

495
00:45:41,953 --> 00:45:45,599
All first-class travel.
Staying at six-star hotels for the whole trip.

496
00:45:45,599 --> 00:45:47,399
The contact's name is Pitcha.

497
00:45:47,399 --> 00:45:50,379
I've checked the schedule already.
If we shuffle some things around, it could work.

498
00:45:50,379 --> 00:45:52,826
Just say you tested positive for COVID
and it'll be over.

499
00:45:52,826 --> 00:45:57,532
At least talk to her. It's a big payday, man.

500
00:46:02,066 --> 00:46:04,206
Traffic's probably bad.

501
00:46:07,842 --> 00:46:11,139
How long have you managed Jay?

502
00:46:11,139 --> 00:46:12,866
About two years.

503
00:46:15,446 --> 00:46:16,912
Is he really that famous?

504
00:46:16,912 --> 00:46:20,926
I tried looking for his photos
and couldn't find anything.

505
00:46:20,926 --> 00:46:24,846
If he's that famous,
shouldn't there at least be some photos of him?

506
00:46:26,899 --> 00:46:30,592
He's so famous,
he can choose not to have pictures online.

507
00:46:30,592 --> 00:46:35,399
Jay doesn't take jobs lightly.
If family's involved, he says no.

508
00:46:36,192 --> 00:46:40,406
Even if the money is crazy good,
if he doesn't want to do it, he won't.

509
00:46:45,492 --> 00:46:49,392
And... if I call him now, will he pick up?

510
00:46:49,392 --> 00:46:51,259
It's been over three hours.

511
00:47:01,759 --> 00:47:03,632
Just in time.

512
00:47:06,452 --> 00:47:07,946
Jay, this is Pitcha.

513
00:47:07,946 --> 00:47:09,819
Pitcha, this is Jay.

514
00:47:25,619 --> 00:47:27,979
Ma! Ma!

515
00:47:27,979 --> 00:47:29,819
Ma!

516
00:47:29,819 --> 00:47:31,619
Ma's not here.

517
00:47:35,099 --> 00:47:37,966
She went to the pier. Should be back soon.

518
00:47:39,112 --> 00:47:41,926
Oh. She left you to watch the shop?

519
00:47:41,926 --> 00:47:45,919
Yeah, I come here a lot. So Ma has me help out.

520
00:47:49,059 --> 00:47:51,792
I've never seen you before.

521
00:47:51,792 --> 00:47:54,166
I've never seen you either.

522
00:47:54,166 --> 00:47:57,959
Honestly, I don't run into many Thai people here.

523
00:47:59,972 --> 00:48:02,652
Are you a land hunter?

524
00:48:02,652 --> 00:48:05,139
Huh? A what?

525
00:48:06,026 --> 00:48:07,492
Guess not.

526
00:48:09,159 --> 00:48:12,552
I'm just a regular employee.

527
00:48:12,552 --> 00:48:14,339
Name's Jira.

528
00:48:15,192 --> 00:48:16,859
Nice to meet you.

529
00:48:18,892 --> 00:48:21,259
Nice to meet you too. And you are...

530
00:48:23,206 --> 00:48:24,819
Plew.

531
00:48:26,359 --> 00:48:27,372
Plew?

532
00:48:27,372 --> 00:48:29,659
Pitcha, shall we begin?

533
00:48:29,659 --> 00:48:35,139
You've been waiting quite a while.
Please have a seat. This is Jay.

534
00:48:42,579 --> 00:48:45,059
Hey ma'am, can you order me a coffee?

535
00:48:45,799 --> 00:48:48,526
Pitcha has been waiting for over three hours.

536
00:48:48,526 --> 00:48:52,226
It's fine. Let him drink his coffee first.

537
00:48:53,872 --> 00:48:55,826
Alright.

538
00:49:06,746 --> 00:49:10,499
So, do I need to go for a medical exam?

539
00:49:11,579 --> 00:49:12,966
Huh?

540
00:49:15,712 --> 00:49:18,659
Any underlying conditions I should know about?

541
00:49:18,659 --> 00:49:20,299
Should we go get checked together?

542
00:49:20,299 --> 00:49:22,599
Should I get checked too?

543
00:49:22,599 --> 00:49:24,586
Gross. I'm just a regular employee.

544
00:49:24,586 --> 00:49:27,259
You didn't tell me what you do, either.

545
00:49:27,259 --> 00:49:29,186
You didn't even tell me your full name.

546
00:49:29,186 --> 00:49:31,586
Why should I?

547
00:49:32,206 --> 00:49:35,219
We're spent ten days together, remember?

548
00:49:36,005 --> 00:49:37,439
So what?

549
00:49:37,439 --> 00:49:38,759
You knowing my full name,

550
00:49:38,759 --> 00:49:42,086
does that suddenly make me
a better person in your eyes?

551
00:49:45,239 --> 00:49:48,893
I don't think
I'll be taking this job, Miss Pitcha.
