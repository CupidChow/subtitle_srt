1
00:00:03,720 --> 00:00:05,367
Good morning.

2
00:00:05,367 --> 00:00:09,160
Good morning. Did you like the hotel breakfast?

3
00:00:09,160 --> 00:00:11,120
Like it?

4
00:00:11,120 --> 00:00:13,993
I mean, was it tasty?

5
00:00:13,993 --> 00:00:16,927
Oh. No.

6
00:00:16,927 --> 00:00:19,080
I woke up late.

7
00:00:19,760 --> 00:00:22,927
- And you? Did you get to eat?
- Yup.

8
00:00:22,927 --> 00:00:26,160
It was good. I liked it.

9
00:00:29,763 --> 00:00:32,820
Could we stop by a roadside café?

10
00:00:32,820 --> 00:00:36,253
I want Thai coffee...

11
00:00:36,253 --> 00:00:38,093
I mean like...

12
00:00:38,093 --> 00:00:41,400
- Traditional Thai iced coffee?
- Yes!

13
00:00:41,400 --> 00:00:44,093
It's really good. I like it a lot.

14
00:00:44,093 --> 00:00:48,260
Okay then.
Shall we eat around the area we're going to visit?

15
00:00:48,260 --> 00:00:50,020
There's a small local community nearby.

16
00:00:50,020 --> 00:00:54,473
You might get to try food that's...

17
00:00:54,473 --> 00:00:56,427
Tasty.

18
00:00:56,427 --> 00:00:57,726
Yes.

19
00:00:58,933 --> 00:01:00,507
Let's go.

20
00:01:10,380 --> 00:01:12,080
Oh.

21
00:01:15,066 --> 00:01:17,393
This land is beautiful.

22
00:01:18,400 --> 00:01:23,547
But the clause that requires
a proper waste water treatment system,

23
00:01:23,547 --> 00:01:27,053
I find that really restrictive.

24
00:01:27,053 --> 00:01:31,427
I'm paying for the land,
why should I have to please anyone else?

25
00:01:31,427 --> 00:01:36,233
But I think that kind of condition can actually
raise the value of your wellness property.

26
00:01:36,233 --> 00:01:40,947
In many countries,
eco-conscious wealthy buyers really get that.

27
00:01:40,947 --> 00:01:45,127
Land that's healthy for people and the planet,
it's valuable.

28
00:01:45,127 --> 00:01:49,907
Like, you could promote your wellness project
as having a central organic farm.

29
00:01:49,907 --> 00:01:55,462
Because the land I'm offering has been certified
to be free from chemical residues.

30
00:01:55,462 --> 00:01:59,907
Don't tell me,
all the land you're showing me is like this?

31
00:01:59,907 --> 00:02:06,140
Yes, because I only act as an agent for buyers
who are willing to protect the environment.

32
00:02:06,140 --> 00:02:08,760
Pitcha, you're such a dreamer.

33
00:02:08,760 --> 00:02:12,000
Did you step out of a cartoon or something?

34
00:02:12,987 --> 00:02:15,227
It's good that some people think this way.

35
00:02:15,227 --> 00:02:20,307
Keeping a beautiful world beautiful,
that matters too.

36
00:02:22,347 --> 00:02:26,480
You're both hopeless dreamers.

37
00:02:35,413 --> 00:02:42,120
I just viewed a property. It's beautiful.

38
00:03:22,607 --> 00:03:25,680
I've got a meeting coming up,
so go ahead and relax.

39
00:03:25,680 --> 00:03:27,293
I'll call you later tonight.

40
00:03:27,293 --> 00:03:28,500
Okay.

41
00:03:28,500 --> 00:03:31,247
Pitcha, thanks.

42
00:03:31,247 --> 00:03:33,540
Tell Jay my flight details for tomorrow.

43
00:03:33,540 --> 00:03:35,113
Sure.

44
00:03:35,113 --> 00:03:36,460
Here.

45
00:03:41,053 --> 00:03:45,440
- So tomorrow I'll...
- My throat's dry. I'll go get a drink.

46
00:03:45,440 --> 00:03:49,320
Can you just listen for a sec?
No need to say anything.

47
00:03:49,320 --> 00:03:52,480
When my throat's dry, my ears stop working too.

48
00:03:52,480 --> 00:03:53,787
Got it?

49
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:04,360
[Red Velvet]

50
00:05:18,460 --> 00:05:22,240
Oh, yes please. One moment.

51
00:05:23,180 --> 00:05:25,807
Hello, what would you like to drink?

52
00:05:25,807 --> 00:05:30,480
In ten minutes it'll be Happy Hour.
You can place your order now if you'd like.

53
00:05:30,480 --> 00:05:32,882
Oh, okay. Let me take a look at the menu.

54
00:05:32,882 --> 00:05:34,480
Sure.

55
00:05:37,080 --> 00:05:39,753
A car will pick us up here at 10 AM tomorrow.

56
00:05:39,753 --> 00:05:41,887
Want a beer?

57
00:05:41,887 --> 00:05:44,667
I'll wait for you at the airport with the tickets.

58
00:05:44,667 --> 00:05:46,920
One glass each is just right.

59
00:05:46,920 --> 00:05:50,007
When we get there,
we'll head straight to the hotel.

60
00:05:51,793 --> 00:05:55,520
Hey, I told you,
when my throat's dry, I can't hear.

61
00:05:55,520 --> 00:05:56,867
And you're annoying, too.

62
00:05:56,867 --> 00:05:59,580
Huh? What'd you say?

63
00:05:59,580 --> 00:06:02,280
I'll email Anita myself.

64
00:06:02,280 --> 00:06:04,027
Hey.

65
00:06:04,027 --> 00:06:06,113
Sit and drink with me.

66
00:06:06,113 --> 00:06:09,513
I'll talk to Anita
about that riverside plot for you.

67
00:06:09,513 --> 00:06:12,840
- What?
- Oh right, I'm deaf now.

68
00:06:13,653 --> 00:06:16,767
You think you're that important?

69
00:06:16,767 --> 00:06:21,327
You really think someone spending
tens of millions would listen to you?

70
00:06:23,880 --> 00:06:25,720
I don't know.

71
00:06:25,720 --> 00:06:27,331
But I've been sitting, lounging,

72
00:06:27,331 --> 00:06:30,240
and chatting with her in a comfy,
air-conditioned room.

73
00:06:30,240 --> 00:06:35,227
Meanwhile, you've been sweating in the sun.

74
00:06:35,227 --> 00:06:37,220
So yeah, up to you.

75
00:06:45,458 --> 00:06:47,165
What's it going to be?

76
00:06:56,256 --> 00:06:58,531
Let's have beer.

77
00:06:58,531 --> 00:07:00,198
Yeah.

78
00:07:04,636 --> 00:07:06,113
Yo, are you hungry?

79
00:07:06,113 --> 00:07:08,627
Not really. Are you girls hungry?

80
00:07:08,627 --> 00:07:11,427
Not yet. Should we check out that bar?

81
00:07:11,427 --> 00:07:15,060
They've got drinks and snacks.

82
00:07:15,060 --> 00:07:17,207
Can we actually eat there?

83
00:07:17,207 --> 00:07:19,480
Well, are you going to eat or not?

84
00:07:31,438 --> 00:07:34,110
Excuse me, where's the restroom?

85
00:07:34,110 --> 00:07:36,293
That way, straight ahead on the left.

86
00:07:36,293 --> 00:07:37,821
Thanks.

87
00:07:38,579 --> 00:07:40,127
You're leaving suddenly.

88
00:07:40,127 --> 00:07:42,940
- Are you hungry?
- Yeah.

89
00:07:51,560 --> 00:07:53,440
What are you doing?

90
00:08:01,160 --> 00:08:06,867
If you're hiding from that group,
they're coming this way.

91
00:08:06,867 --> 00:08:09,040
Don't let them see me. Please.

92
00:08:12,880 --> 00:08:17,207
Oh, I think over there might be better.

93
00:08:17,207 --> 00:08:19,413
Sure, up to you.

94
00:08:19,413 --> 00:08:22,440
- Laks, have a seat.
- Sure.

95
00:08:25,053 --> 00:08:28,080
- I'll be right back.
- Okay.

96
00:08:32,820 --> 00:08:37,200
- Jay! It's been so long.
- Hey, Prang.

97
00:08:37,200 --> 00:08:42,093
I went to the shop the other day
and Gur said you had a ten-day gig?

98
00:08:42,093 --> 00:08:43,247
Yeah.

99
00:08:43,247 --> 00:08:45,627
Don't tell me, you're sleeping here?

100
00:08:45,627 --> 00:08:47,360
Yup.

101
00:08:47,360 --> 00:08:48,600
I'm so jealous.

102
00:08:48,600 --> 00:08:51,680
I've been here so many times
and never stayed the night.

103
00:08:53,673 --> 00:08:55,280
Came with a guest?

104
00:08:55,280 --> 00:08:56,720
Yup.

105
00:08:56,720 --> 00:08:59,647
Okay, I won't bother you. See you at the bar.

106
00:08:59,647 --> 00:09:00,980
Okay.

107
00:09:00,980 --> 00:09:03,440
- Hey, Prang.
- Huh?

108
00:09:05,300 --> 00:09:10,207
Can you ask that group of guests to
sit somewhere else?

109
00:09:11,480 --> 00:09:14,693
Crap. Are our clients clashing?

110
00:09:14,693 --> 00:09:17,313
Well...

111
00:09:17,313 --> 00:09:19,707
Whose guest? Yo's wife or Laks'?

112
00:09:19,707 --> 00:09:22,873
I'm not sure, but it's better to play it safe.

113
00:09:22,873 --> 00:09:26,040
- Okay. I'll take care of it.
- Thanks a lot.

114
00:09:26,880 --> 00:09:29,307
Wow, you're a real lifesaver.

115
00:09:29,307 --> 00:09:34,753
Laks, I think we'd be more comfortable
at that place over there.

116
00:09:34,753 --> 00:09:37,493
Sure, dear.

117
00:09:37,493 --> 00:09:40,373
- Rachel's hungry.
- That place has dishes you like.

118
00:09:40,373 --> 00:09:42,200
Sounds great. Let's go.

119
00:09:46,027 --> 00:09:47,907
They're all gone.

120
00:09:52,330 --> 00:09:54,110
You sure?

121
00:09:58,693 --> 00:10:00,700
Who are you hiding from?

122
00:10:03,847 --> 00:10:06,880
Your line of work is just sinful.

123
00:10:06,880 --> 00:10:08,409
Huh?

124
00:10:08,409 --> 00:10:10,753
Hey, wait, what is this?

125
00:10:10,753 --> 00:10:12,480
You...

126
00:10:13,753 --> 00:10:16,396
Hey, you, wait!

127
00:10:16,396 --> 00:10:18,346
Do you know those two guys?

128
00:10:18,346 --> 00:10:22,100
One already has a wife.
The other's about to get married.

129
00:10:22,100 --> 00:10:23,720
So?

130
00:10:23,720 --> 00:10:27,320
They're doing something disgusting.

131
00:10:28,333 --> 00:10:31,280
What does that have to do with me?

132
00:10:31,280 --> 00:10:34,740
You know that girl. You know each other.

133
00:10:34,740 --> 00:10:39,267
Oh, right. Her name's Maprang.
She's a regular at the bar.

134
00:10:39,267 --> 00:10:40,748
Why?

135
00:10:42,240 --> 00:10:46,060
So you're supporting your own industry, huh?

136
00:10:46,920 --> 00:10:50,353
Why do you always talk like that?

137
00:10:50,353 --> 00:10:54,887
Don't just be kind to the planet,
try being kind to people too.

138
00:10:54,887 --> 00:10:56,513
And you?

139
00:10:56,513 --> 00:11:00,560
Have you ever been kind to the people
who suffer from your clients' choices?

140
00:11:00,560 --> 00:11:03,167
What if their wives and kids found out?

141
00:11:04,887 --> 00:11:09,033
Even if she didn't take the job,
someone else would.

142
00:11:09,713 --> 00:11:13,133
You can't just blame the service side.

143
00:11:13,133 --> 00:11:17,113
The clients should know what's right and wrong.

144
00:11:17,113 --> 00:11:20,520
Why don't you go scold them, huh?

145
00:11:23,860 --> 00:11:26,160
You know those men, don't you?

146
00:11:27,253 --> 00:11:29,080
Stay out of this.

147
00:11:51,138 --> 00:11:53,482
Was that your friend just now?

148
00:11:53,482 --> 00:11:55,200
Who?

149
00:11:56,947 --> 00:12:01,973
Oh, just an older colleague.
He used to work at the bar.

150
00:12:01,973 --> 00:12:04,687
An ex-colleague?

151
00:12:04,687 --> 00:12:06,867
Yeah.

152
00:12:06,867 --> 00:12:10,887
But he quit years ago to start a business.

153
00:12:10,887 --> 00:12:15,953
Wow, from a job like this
to running his own business?

154
00:12:15,953 --> 00:12:19,240
Must've gotten a sponsor, huh?

155
00:12:19,240 --> 00:12:21,453
Probably.

156
00:12:22,673 --> 00:12:25,200
What about you, Laks?

157
00:12:25,200 --> 00:12:29,727
Want to sponsor me like that?

158
00:12:29,727 --> 00:12:33,520
Hey, he's getting married, remember?

159
00:12:33,520 --> 00:12:36,147
That's not a problem for me.

160
00:12:37,327 --> 00:12:44,687
As long as you behave,
and I don't get bored, anything's possible.

161
00:12:56,953 --> 00:13:00,853
Mom, doesn't this blue look too bright?

162
00:13:00,853 --> 00:13:03,480
This one looks too masculine.

163
00:13:03,480 --> 00:13:06,760
I think this color works better.
Good for both men and women.

164
00:13:08,002 --> 00:13:09,600
Cha!

165
00:13:09,600 --> 00:13:11,560
Come help me pick.

166
00:13:17,380 --> 00:13:18,913
Hurry up.

167
00:13:20,465 --> 00:13:23,060
You're choosing wedding favors already?

168
00:13:23,060 --> 00:13:27,607
Of course.
Everything needs to be ordered in advance.

169
00:13:27,607 --> 00:13:31,000
Isn't Laks helping?

170
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:33,047
His family has a party today.

171
00:13:33,047 --> 00:13:36,473
Oh, what about this music box, Cha? Isn't it cute?

172
00:13:37,087 --> 00:13:39,447
Very.

173
00:13:39,447 --> 00:13:43,300
But I think
the wedding's getting a bit out of hand.

174
00:13:43,300 --> 00:13:50,407
I talked to Mrs. Jear,
and she said the guest list is ballooning.

175
00:13:50,407 --> 00:13:56,693
My friends said
it might be the biggest wedding this year.

176
00:13:56,693 --> 00:14:02,760
Cha, if my wedding is the biggest of the year,
yours better not be a letdown.

177
00:14:02,760 --> 00:14:06,093
Stop talking about weddings.

178

I'm here to entertain, not to sell myself.

353
00:31:44,907 --> 00:31:46,993
Why are you laughing?

354
00:31:49,647 --> 00:31:53,813
If you please Anita,
she'll probably give you a lot more.

355
00:31:53,813 --> 00:31:56,687
If I'm not okay with it, then I'm not okay.
Simple as that.

356
00:31:56,687 --> 00:31:59,720
But if I am okay with it,
you wouldn't have to pay me a single baht

357
00:31:59,720 --> 00:32:01,527
and you know that.

358
00:32:05,013 --> 00:32:06,493
Oh, I see.

359
00:32:06,493 --> 00:32:09,660
Come here. Feeling powerful, huh?

360
00:32:10,620 --> 00:32:13,940
- You... What are you doing?
- You were pretty bold just now, weren't you?

361
00:32:13,940 --> 00:32:16,227
No, don't, stop!

362
00:32:22,653 --> 00:32:25,107
You creep!

363
00:32:25,107 --> 00:32:27,520
Go sleep wherever you want.
I'm sleeping in your room!

364
00:32:27,520 --> 00:32:31,200
You!

365
00:35:17,280 --> 00:35:19,360
I'm free today, huh?

366
00:35:27,660 --> 00:35:29,480
Ah, here you go.

367
00:35:29,480 --> 00:35:32,660
Wow, still looks delicious as ever.

368
00:35:32,960 --> 00:35:36,320
[Grandma Jan's Restaurant]
Been a while, dear. Busy with work?

369
00:35:36,320 --> 00:35:38,680
Well, not too bad.

370
00:35:38,680 --> 00:35:43,777
I've been coming to Chiang Mai pretty often,
I just haven't had a chance to stop by.

371
00:35:43,777 --> 00:35:46,500
Lucky you, always traveling.

372
00:35:46,500 --> 00:35:51,493
No, I'm working.
I brought someone here to look at land.

373
00:35:51,493 --> 00:35:54,720
Aunt Jaew,
are you really still not changing your mind?

374
00:35:54,720 --> 00:36:00,180
If you let me sell even just one tree,
I promise nothing else will be touched.

375
00:36:00,180 --> 00:36:05,813
Oh, I'd love to sell.
I can't manage all this anymore.

376
00:36:05,813 --> 00:36:11,613
Cutting grass, fixing fences,
building firebreaks during dry season...

377
00:36:11,613 --> 00:36:14,393
It all costs money, dear.

378
00:36:14,393 --> 00:36:17,980
But Grandma, she refuses to sell, no matter what.

379
00:36:19,087 --> 00:36:22,307
Well, I've got an investor from China.

380
00:36:22,307 --> 00:36:26,380
Can I bring her by to look tomorrow?
Maybe Grandma will change her mind.

381
00:36:28,813 --> 00:36:30,907
It's no small offer.

382
00:36:30,907 --> 00:36:34,160
If you sell,
your whole family could live comfortably.

383
00:36:37,507 --> 00:36:41,927
Alright, bring her. Should be okay.

384
00:36:41,927 --> 00:36:45,680
Great! I'll come by tomorrow afternoon.

385
00:36:45,680 --> 00:36:48,500
Sure, tomorrow afternoon.

386
00:36:48,500 --> 00:36:52,467
Oh! I almost forgot, I made some long an juice.
It's really good.

387
00:36:52,467 --> 00:36:54,680
- Let me go get you some.
- Thank you.

388
00:36:54,680 --> 00:36:57,920
Eat up, it's getting cold.

389
00:37:02,520 --> 00:37:06,240
[Grandma Jan's Restaurant]

390
00:37:12,100 --> 00:37:13,560
Plew.

391
00:37:17,527 --> 00:37:20,680
Ji! When did you get here?

392
00:37:21,700 --> 00:37:25,040
Why didn't you tell me you were coming?
Come here, give me a hug!

393
00:37:25,040 --> 00:37:27,713
Aw, I missed you.

394
00:37:29,336 --> 00:37:32,213
Where are your bags?

395
00:37:32,213 --> 00:37:34,053
How long are you staying this time?

396
00:37:39,687 --> 00:37:41,967
Hey, this is Jira, my son.

397
00:37:41,967 --> 00:37:46,887
I've told you about him before.
He works as a car salesman in Bangkok.

398
00:37:48,840 --> 00:37:51,847
- Hello.
- Hi.

399
00:37:53,093 --> 00:37:56,773
And this is the girl I mentioned,
the one bringing someone to see the land.

400
00:38:03,280 --> 00:38:07,907
Good thing you're here.
Tomorrow she's bringing someone to view the land.

401
00:38:07,907 --> 00:38:09,787
Let's get a rough valuation first.

402
00:38:09,787 --> 00:38:12,233
Do you want to talk to her now?

403
00:38:13,080 --> 00:38:17,267
If the price is good, I'll go talk to Grandma.

404
00:38:17,267 --> 00:38:21,600
Look. He's Grandma's favorite, you know.

405
00:38:22,913 --> 00:38:26,967
No need to bring anyone, Mom.
Grandma will never agree to sell, no matter what.

406
00:38:29,533 --> 00:38:33,780
Jira, but this could clear all our debts.

407
00:38:33,780 --> 00:38:36,320
You wouldn't have to work so hard
in Bangkok anymore.

408
00:38:36,320 --> 00:38:39,080
Mom, please don't bring that up now.

409
00:38:39,080 --> 00:38:41,486
Oh, she already knows everything.

410
00:38:41,486 --> 00:38:44,560
She comes here often, I've told her all about you.

411
00:38:44,560 --> 00:38:48,120
How you work so hard,
pay for your sibling's tuition,

412
00:38:48,120 --> 00:38:51,000
cover Grandma's medical bills,
and even put the house up as collateral.

413
00:38:51,000 --> 00:38:52,500
Mom!

414
00:38:54,387 --> 00:38:57,640
I just think you're working too hard, dear.

415
00:38:57,640 --> 00:39:00,353
It'll be years before your sibling graduates.

416
00:39:01,040 --> 00:39:05,327
- And we still owe millions on the house.
- That's enough, Mom.

417
00:39:07,693 --> 00:39:09,787
Jira...

418
00:39:09,787 --> 00:39:14,247
Try asking Grandma to sell even half.
That would still help a lot, right?

419
00:39:18,313 --> 00:39:21,833
Dear.

420
00:39:22,760 --> 00:39:27,400
Please, try talking to her for us.
Convince her to sell a little.

421
00:39:40,987 --> 00:39:43,100
Hey, about my job...

422
00:39:43,100 --> 00:39:44,453
Don't worry.

423
00:39:44,453 --> 00:39:48,267
I won't say anything.

424
00:39:51,820 --> 00:39:53,606
Thank you.

425
00:40:00,860 --> 00:40:05,240
All of this land,
my grandfather bought it for my grandma.

426
00:40:06,420 --> 00:40:09,300
They built their life together here...

427
00:40:09,300 --> 00:40:11,693
She loves it dearly.

428
00:40:11,693 --> 00:40:13,660
Your grandfather isn't around anymore?

429
00:40:13,660 --> 00:40:17,400
No, he passed away years ago.

430
00:40:18,587 --> 00:40:21,662
Everyone tells Grandma to sell the land.

431
00:40:21,662 --> 00:40:25,040
They're telling her that it's too big,
too much to maintain.

432
00:40:25,693 --> 00:40:30,553
But she just invites people she knows
to come grow rice and coffee nearby.

433
00:40:31,840 --> 00:40:35,813
See over there? Several families live there now.

434
00:40:40,107 --> 00:40:45,320
The reason I work in Bangkok
is because Grandma refuses to sell.

435
00:40:49,520 --> 00:40:53,233
There was a time she collapsed,

436
00:40:53,233 --> 00:40:56,080
and was bedridden in the ICU
for almost two months.

437
00:40:57,040 --> 00:41:00,300
I lost my job due to COVID.

438
00:41:00,300 --> 00:41:03,027
Mom couldn't sell her goods.

439
00:41:03,027 --> 00:41:05,313
We had no money.

440
00:41:07,033 --> 00:41:09,680
Mom even had to mortgage the house.

441
00:41:14,407 --> 00:41:19,320
After COVID, I went to Bangkok to look for work.

442
00:41:20,593 --> 00:41:25,073
But a regular office salary just doesn't cut it.

443
00:41:25,073 --> 00:41:31,533
Not with tuition fees, Grandma's hospital bills,
there was just no way.

444
00:41:32,900 --> 00:41:35,880
Then a friend invited me to work at Bar Smile.

445
00:41:38,920 --> 00:41:42,667
But soon, I think I'll be able to leave this job.

446
00:41:43,733 --> 00:41:45,787
You really plan to quit?

447
00:41:47,549 --> 00:41:48,835
Yeah.

448
00:41:50,900 --> 00:41:55,793
Being seen as a male escort, it's not fun.

449
00:41:58,407 --> 00:42:04,473
I had to take a job I'm not proud of,
just to keep Grandma's land.

450
00:42:10,680 --> 00:42:12,247
Look.

451
00:42:14,553 --> 00:42:17,000
You don't need to bring anyone
to see the land anymore.

452
00:42:17,835 --> 00:42:21,362
I'm not selling, no matter what.

453
00:42:26,713 --> 00:42:30,567
Do you want to meet my grandma?
Since you're already here.

454
00:42:30,567 --> 00:42:32,907
- Yeah.
- Let's go.

455
00:42:38,147 --> 00:42:39,707
Grandma.

456
00:42:41,327 --> 00:42:43,047
Grandma.

457
00:42:45,573 --> 00:42:49,107
Grandma, I'm right here.

458
00:42:49,107 --> 00:42:53,260
Jira! Come here, dear!

459
00:42:56,160 --> 00:43:01,473
Come, come!

460
00:43:01,473 --> 00:43:03,173
Hello, Grandma.

461
00:43:03,820 --> 00:43:08,093
Jira! Oh my, when did you get here?

462
00:43:08,093 --> 00:43:10,300
Why didn't you tell me?

463
00:43:10,300 --> 00:43:11,980
You've lost weight.

464
00:43:11,980 --> 00:43:13,600
You look pale.

465
00:43:13,600 --> 00:43:15,932
Are you tired? Have you eaten yet?

466
00:43:15,932 --> 00:43:19,519
Oh my, too many questions!
I can't answer them all!

467
00:43:19,519 --> 00:43:20,833
Look over there.

468
00:43:21,675 --> 00:43:23,100
Hello.

469
00:43:23,100 --> 00:43:25,253
Who's this? Your wife?

470
00:43:25,253 --> 00:43:27,207
No, no, it's not like that.

471
00:43:27,207 --> 00:43:29,200
Not at all!

472
00:43:29,200 --> 00:43:31,660
But if she were, would you approve?

473
00:43:31,660 --> 00:43:33,253
Why is she so small?

474
00:43:33,253 --> 00:43:34,793
Friend, friend!

475
00:43:34,793 --> 00:43:37,553
We're just friends. My name's Pitcha.

476
00:43:37,553 --> 00:43:40,240
Oh, come closer.

477
00:43:41,227 --> 00:43:45,760
Fair skin, so pretty.

478
00:43:45,760 --> 00:43:48,360
Very pretty.

479
00:43:54,660 --> 00:44:02,540
Well... Thank you for playing along with me
about my job.

480
00:44:03,299 --> 00:44:09,159
I can't imagine how my family would feel
if they knew what I really do.

481
00:44:10,267 --> 00:44:12,747
They'll understand.

482
00:44:16,597 --> 00:44:19,673
Sorry for throwing you into the water last night.

483
00:44:19,673 --> 00:44:21,287
Yeah.

484
00:44:24,838 --> 00:44:26,518
Pitcha.

485
00:44:27,223 --> 00:44:29,090
Truce?

486
00:44:29,927 --> 00:44:31,660
Truce.

487
00:44:36,227 --> 00:44:37,707
Hey.

488
00:44:38,773 --> 00:44:45,440
I'm sorry for the harsh things I said
about your job.

489
00:44:47,660 --> 00:44:51,193
I was being narrow-minded.

490
00:44:53,793 --> 00:44:57,273
Aunt Jaew told me a lot about you.

491
00:44:59,973 --> 00:45:03,707
About all the sacrifices you've made
for your family.

492
00:45:03,707 --> 00:45:09,033
I feel terrible, for judging you.

493
00:45:09,033 --> 00:45:14,400
Nobody wants to work a job like that
if they had a choice.

494
00:45:17,313 --> 00:45:20,027
I really am sorry.

495
00:45:20,027 --> 00:45:23,393
I had no right to speak that way.

496
00:45:23,393 --> 00:45:25,693
It's okay. Let it go.

497
00:45:25,693 --> 00:45:27,827
I'm not mad.

498
00:45:27,827 --> 00:45:29,567
I'm used to it.

499
00:45:32,627 --> 00:45:33,747
Hey.

500
00:45:33,747 --> 00:45:35,107
Yeah?

501
00:45:37,974 --> 00:45:39,948
I'm rooting for you.

502
00:46:42,213 --> 00:46:44,353
- Hey.
- Yeah?

503
00:46:44,353 --> 00:46:47,020
Tonight you're going back home, right?

504
00:46:47,020 --> 00:46:50,580
You told your mom and grandma you came back.

505
00:46:50,580 --> 00:46:53,800
Oh right. What should I do?

506
00:46:53,800 --> 00:46:55,307
Pitcha.

507
00:46:59,213 --> 00:47:02,740
Where have you been?
You two look like you had fun.

508
00:47:04,953 --> 00:47:07,220
We went biking.

509
00:47:07,220 --> 00:47:12,220
Oh, I thought you went swimming.

510
00:47:16,153 --> 00:47:18,420
Your room's sorted now,

511
00:47:18,420 --> 00:47:22,027
we can sleep in separate rooms again.

512
00:47:22,027 --> 00:47:24,413
Go take a shower.

513
00:47:25,080 --> 00:47:28,160
I have something to discuss with you, Pitcha.

514
00:47:46,980 --> 00:47:49,627
Last night, what happened?

515
00:47:49,627 --> 00:47:53,633
- Well, I...
- I saw him throw you into the water.
