1
00:00:07,706 --> 00:00:11,399
So, do I need to go for a medical exam?

2
00:00:12,526 --> 00:00:14,066
Huh?

3
00:00:16,686 --> 00:00:19,326
Any underlying conditions I should know about?

4
00:00:19,326 --> 00:00:21,266
Should we go get checked together?

5
00:00:21,266 --> 00:00:23,560
Should I get checked too?

6
00:00:23,560 --> 00:00:25,552
Gross. I'm just a regular employee.

7
00:00:25,552 --> 00:00:28,186
You didn't tell me what you do, either.

8
00:00:28,186 --> 00:00:29,899
You didn't even tell me your full name.

9
00:00:29,899 --> 00:00:32,539
Why should I?

10
00:00:33,146 --> 00:00:36,819
We've spent ten days together, remember?

11
00:00:36,819 --> 00:00:38,406
So what?

12
00:00:38,406 --> 00:00:39,679
You knowing my full name,

13
00:00:39,679 --> 00:00:43,012
does that suddenly make me
a better person in your eyes?

14
00:00:46,175 --> 00:00:49,635
I don't think
I'll be taking this job, Miss Pitcha.

15
00:00:50,652 --> 00:00:53,432
- Jay, Jay, wait, can we talk?
- I'm not taking this job, ma'am.

16
00:00:53,432 --> 00:00:55,639
Hey, come on!

17
00:00:55,639 --> 00:00:58,397
I'll pay you triple!

18
00:00:58,397 --> 00:01:01,226
Triple? Do you even know what my rate is?

19
00:01:01,226 --> 00:01:05,726
I don't. Just name it, how much do you charge?

20
00:01:05,726 --> 00:01:08,179
Doesn't matter. I'm not taking it.

21
00:01:08,179 --> 00:01:11,492
I don't want to work with Pitcha.

22
00:01:11,492 --> 00:01:13,239
What?

23
00:01:21,059 --> 00:01:23,126
Wait, wait. Just a second, hold on.

24
00:01:25,472 --> 00:01:28,599
- Jay! Jay!
- What now?

25
00:01:28,599 --> 00:01:32,839
- Come on, it's triple for ten days!
- No!

26
00:01:32,839 --> 00:01:36,332
It's an easy out-of-town trip.
I already told her you'd sleep separately!

27
00:01:36,332 --> 00:01:38,166
Still no, ma'am. I'm not doing it.

28
00:01:38,166 --> 00:01:40,932
You won't have to show up at the bar
for ten whole days.

29
00:01:41,572 --> 00:01:45,138
Are you not hearing me? I said no.
And stop following me.

30
00:01:45,138 --> 00:01:47,158
What's going on?

31
00:01:54,332 --> 00:01:56,492
Did you two know each other before or something?

32
00:01:56,492 --> 00:01:58,512
Why is Jay so worked up?

33
00:02:00,499 --> 00:02:03,599
Do you have any other high-profile guys available?

34
00:02:05,646 --> 00:02:08,226
Anyone else?

35
00:02:08,226 --> 00:02:09,586
Yeah.

36
00:02:09,586 --> 00:02:13,779
I've got three or four more coming up.
I'll send them to you.

37
00:02:17,246 --> 00:02:19,852
What's Jira's rate?

38
00:02:19,852 --> 00:02:21,026
Huh?

39
00:02:21,026 --> 00:02:22,526
Sorry, what?

40
00:02:23,700 --> 00:02:25,740
How do you know Jay's real name?

41
00:02:26,346 --> 00:02:30,433
Wait, that's really his name?

42
00:02:32,799 --> 00:02:36,999
Don't call him that, he hates people knowing it.

43
00:02:39,612 --> 00:02:44,192
Jay charges however much he feels like.
You can't control it.

44
00:02:44,192 --> 00:02:47,252
Just don't offer less than he's worth.

45
00:02:47,252 --> 00:02:52,806
The baseline is about 100,000 baht a day.
He's been paid as much as a million.

46
00:02:53,857 --> 00:02:56,379
A million... per what?

47
00:02:56,379 --> 00:02:58,279
Per day, of course.

48
00:02:58,279 --> 00:03:00,546
Chinese clients.

49
00:03:00,546 --> 00:03:03,332
They wanted him on short notice,
so they just threw a million at him.

50
00:03:03,332 --> 00:03:05,477
All he had to do was eat with them,

51
00:03:05,477 --> 00:03:08,079
take them to a temple,
then drop them off at the airport at night.

52
00:03:10,119 --> 00:03:11,952
You want him seriously?

53
00:03:11,952 --> 00:03:17,199
If your client specifically asked for Jay,
no one else can replace him.

54
00:03:17,199 --> 00:03:20,139
But if you want to try others, go ahead.

55
00:03:34,899 --> 00:03:37,692
Any underlying conditions I should know about?

56
00:03:37,692 --> 00:03:39,326
Should we go get checked together?

57
00:03:39,326 --> 00:03:41,606
Should I get checked too?

58
00:03:41,606 --> 00:03:43,699
Gross. I'm just a regular employee.

59
00:03:43,699 --> 00:03:46,392
You didn't tell me what you do, either.

60
00:03:46,392 --> 00:03:48,199
You didn't even tell me your full name.

61
00:03:48,199 --> 00:03:50,499
Why should I?

62
00:04:05,826 --> 00:04:09,199
We've spent ten days together, remember?

63
00:04:09,199 --> 00:04:10,666
So what?

64
00:04:10,666 --> 00:04:12,498
You knowing my full name,

65
00:04:12,498 --> 00:04:15,446
does that suddenly make me
a better person in your eyes?

66
00:04:18,571 --> 00:04:22,044
I don't think I'll be taking this job,
Miss Pitcha.

67
00:04:26,060 --> 00:04:28,659
How did it end up like this?

68
00:04:49,400 --> 00:04:53,979
The baseline is about 100,000 baht a day.
He's been paid as much as a million.

69
00:04:53,979 --> 00:04:59,739
Triple that... for ten days...
that's three million, right?

70
00:06:12,952 --> 00:06:15,739
Excuse me, boss.

71
00:06:15,739 --> 00:06:20,206
Miss Pitcha just sent over host profiles
for you to choose from.

72
00:06:20,206 --> 00:06:22,386
I already picked one.

73
00:06:22,386 --> 00:06:26,979
Well, it seems she can't get in touch with Jay.

74
00:06:28,406 --> 00:06:30,432
What about the others?

75
00:06:30,432 --> 00:06:33,139
Same problem.

76
00:06:36,200 --> 00:06:38,160
Don't they realize?

77
00:06:38,160 --> 00:06:44,666
I don't even have to go,
but I'm going because I want to relax.

78
00:06:44,666 --> 00:06:49,732
Let me confirm this for them.

79
00:06:50,939 --> 00:06:59,352
Just tell them, whoever gets Jay,
I'll go with them.

80
00:06:59,352 --> 00:07:01,526
Yes, boss.

81
00:07:06,686 --> 00:07:11,319
If you can book Jay, Anita will take the trip.

82
00:07:13,402 --> 00:07:15,752
What do I do now?

83
00:07:27,672 --> 00:07:28,686
Yes?

84
00:07:28,686 --> 00:07:33,019
Excuse me, Tiwa.
You get a cut of Jira's rate, right?

85
00:07:33,019 --> 00:07:34,046
Yes.

86
00:07:34,046 --> 00:07:37,392
Then tell me where he is.

87
00:07:37,392 --> 00:07:39,000
I'll go talk to him myself.

88
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:42,072
If I can convince him,
your commission will be huge.

89
00:07:42,072 --> 00:07:45,512
If you want that cut, tell me where to find him.

90
00:07:46,352 --> 00:07:49,719
- Tiwa?
- Okay, okay. I'll send you the location.

91
00:07:49,719 --> 00:07:52,499
And don't call him Jira.

92
00:07:56,920 --> 00:07:59,560
[Tiwa]

93
00:08:15,026 --> 00:08:17,246
I came here to ask for your help.

94
00:08:19,039 --> 00:08:21,239
Your real name's not even Plew, is it?

95
00:08:22,666 --> 00:08:24,572
Does it matter?

96
00:08:28,259 --> 00:08:31,339
My name is Pitcha. I don't have a nickname.

97
00:08:34,299 --> 00:08:38,532
Then it's nice
to officially meet you, Miss Pitcha.

98
00:08:38,532 --> 00:08:42,672
My name's Jira, just one name.

99
00:08:43,612 --> 00:08:46,819
Do you remember what I said the other day?

100
00:08:46,819 --> 00:08:50,186
When I told you how important
this project is to me?

101
00:08:50,186 --> 00:08:52,032
No.

102
00:08:52,032 --> 00:08:56,306
My client really wants you for this.

103
00:08:56,939 --> 00:09:01,339
- If it's not you, she won't come. And I'll...
- That has nothing to do with me or my job.

104
00:09:02,426 --> 00:09:06,579
Come on, if you think sitting around
being charming to women is a real job,

105
00:09:06,579 --> 00:09:07,680
can't you just help me out?

106
00:09:07,680 --> 00:09:09,032
It's not like it's that hard.

107
00:09:09,032 --> 00:09:12,366
If you're going to ask someone for help,
don't say it like that.

108
00:09:13,119 --> 00:09:16,506
Don't assume my job isn't exhausting,
doesn't take effort, or cost me anything.

109
00:09:17,119 --> 00:09:19,492
Try asking in a way
that actually makes someone want to help.

110
00:09:23,052 --> 00:09:25,426
Fine. I'm sorry.

111
00:09:27,679 --> 00:09:31,072
I'm sorry. Okay?

112
00:09:34,466 --> 00:09:38,059
You now versus who you were back on the island,
you're nothing alike.

113
00:09:38,059 --> 00:09:41,332
Can you just forget about what happened back then?

114
00:09:41,332 --> 00:09:42,746
Back when?

115
00:09:43,399 --> 00:09:45,546
I don't mean that specific moment.

116
00:09:45,546 --> 00:09:48,326
I mean those moments when we just sat and talked.

117
00:09:49,366 --> 00:09:54,052
Whatever moment it was, forget it. Please.

118
00:09:54,052 --> 00:09:55,366
You serious?

119
00:09:55,366 --> 00:09:57,806
You just asked me if I remembered,
now you're telling me to forget.

120
00:09:57,806 --> 00:09:59,619
What do you actually want, Pitcha?

121
00:09:59,619 --> 00:10:04,432
Can you be more professional?

122
00:10:04,432 --> 00:10:07,679
I'm hiring you for a job, right?
Then let's just stick to that.

123
00:10:07,679 --> 00:10:10,499
Forget whatever happened on the island.

124
00:10:10,499 --> 00:10:12,912
Well, I don't work for you.

125
00:10:12,912 --> 00:10:16,059
I'm professional enough to choose my work.

126
00:10:16,059 --> 00:10:20,866
And I have no issue with your client,
my issue is with you.

127
00:10:20,866 --> 00:10:24,752
Let me be clear. If your client had someone else
contact me, I probably would've taken it.

128
00:10:24,752 --> 00:10:27,939
But since it's you, I won't.

129
00:10:27,939 --> 00:10:32,612
Why did you hate me this much?
What did I ever do to you?

130
00:10:32,612 --> 00:10:36,552
It's the way you speak. It's not nice.

131
00:10:38,056 --> 00:10:41,106
I'm offering you a very generous amount of money.

132
00:10:41,106 --> 00:10:43,699
Do I have to be nice too?

133
00:10:45,286 --> 00:10:47,226
Go get your medical check-up first.

134
00:11:19,559 --> 00:11:21,719
Flat tire?

135
00:11:21,719 --> 00:11:23,352
Oh, it's you.

136
00:11:23,352 --> 00:11:25,059
I'm Jira.

137
00:11:26,604 --> 00:11:29,200
Wanna hop on? I'll take you to get a replacement.

138
00:11:29,200 --> 00:11:32,635
What about this?

139
00:11:32,635 --> 00:11:34,659
Leave it here.

140
00:11:39,019 --> 00:11:40,972
And where exactly are you going?

141
00:11:40,972 --> 00:11:42,317
The other side of the island.

142
00:11:42,317 --> 00:11:45,080
Ma said it's beautiful.
I thought I'd check it out.

143
00:11:45,080 --> 00:11:48,939
Really? I'll come too. Never been there.

144
00:11:48,939 --> 00:11:50,312
Alright.

145
00:11:53,979 --> 00:11:55,272
Ready?

146
00:11:55,272 --> 00:11:56,592
Ready.

147
00:11:56,592 --> 00:11:58,419
Let's go.

148
00:13:25,919 --> 00:13:27,079
Hey Grandma.

149
00:13:27,079 --> 00:13:30,086
Have you eaten yet, dear? Am I bothering you?

150
00:13:30,086 --> 00:13:33,192
Not at all! How are you?

151
00:13:33,192 --> 00:13:34,939
You went to the doctor, right? How was it?

152
00:13:34,939 --> 00:13:37,432
That's what I was calling about.

153
00:13:37,432 --> 00:13:42,059
The meds... they cost tens of thousands.

154
00:13:42,059 --> 00:13:43,866
Why is it so expensive?

155
00:13:43,866 --> 00:13:46,952
I'm old, I can take whatever.

156
00:13:46,952 --> 00:13:49,699
No, you can't take just anything.

157
00:13:49,699 --> 00:13:53,672
I just feel bad for you.
How are you gonna keep up with all the expenses?

158
00:13:53,672 --> 00:13:57,159
You take me to the hospital
two, three times a month.

159
00:13:57,159 --> 00:14:00,592
Your salary's not that much. Can you even manage?

160
00:14:00,592 --> 00:14:02,778
Grandma, listen.

161
00:14:02,778 --> 00:14:07,386
Keep going to the same hospital.
It's faster, and less waiting time.

162
00:14:07,386 --> 00:14:11,932
Eat well, take your meds properly,
and exercise like the doctor said.

163
00:14:11,932 --> 00:14:13,139
Don't worry about the money.

164
00:14:13,139 --> 00:14:17,486
Do you have any money left for something tasty?

165
00:14:17,486 --> 00:14:19,672
I eat well every day.

166
00:14:19,672 --> 00:14:22,132
The neighbor made sour curry for me.

167
00:14:22,132 --> 00:14:24,332
As good as mine?

168
00:14:24,332 --> 00:14:27,646
No way. Yours is the best.

169
00:14:36,372 --> 00:14:42,492
If you don't make those hundreds of millions
like you claimed,

170
00:14:42,492 --> 00:14:46,312
you'll stop everything
and go work for your sister.

171
00:14:46,312 --> 00:14:51,059
If you can book Jay, Anita will take the trip.

172
00:14:53,526 --> 00:14:58,492
I want to understand what everyone's raving about.
Let's see what the fuss is.

173
00:15:45,580 --> 00:15:47,926
Hey beautiful.

174
00:15:47,926 --> 00:15:50,439
You here alone or with friends?

175
00:15:50,439 --> 00:15:52,379
Well...

176
00:15:53,132 --> 00:15:57,839
Hiding behind a mask?
Sneaking out with COVID or what?

177
00:16:03,399 --> 00:16:08,139
Got a table yet? How many of you?
I'll get one ready.

178
00:16:08,786 --> 00:16:12,306
I came with a friend. I'll wait for her.

179
00:16:12,306 --> 00:16:16,832
How many in total? Just so I know what size table
to assign to you.

180
00:16:19,066 --> 00:16:21,352
Is Jay working tonight?

181
00:16:21,352 --> 00:16:26,426
Wow, straight to Jay, huh?
You just got here and already asking for him?

182
00:16:26,426 --> 00:16:30,372
Welll... Jay?

183
00:16:31,306 --> 00:16:36,012
Well, if he's in, you'll see him.
So how many of you, again?

184
00:16:40,619 --> 00:16:44,046
- Jay!
- Hello.

185
00:16:45,099 --> 00:16:46,792
Jay!

186
00:16:47,546 --> 00:16:49,619
Jay!

187
00:17:04,899 --> 00:17:08,579
Jay's here. You're lucky tonight.

188
00:17:09,192 --> 00:17:13,799
Today's been toxic, ladies.

189
00:17:13,799 --> 00:17:17,099
I need to listen to something I like.

190
00:17:28,646 --> 00:17:30,752
Let's go!

191
00:18:02,652 --> 00:18:05,179
Jay!

192
00:18:05,179 --> 00:18:08,399
Alright, lovely guests!

193
00:18:08,399 --> 00:18:12,099
I've got great news for you tonight.

194
00:18:12,099 --> 00:18:19,099
Our hottest host, Jay, is here at the club!

195
00:18:21,726 --> 00:18:26,232
Now, ladies,
if anyone's interested in having a drink with Jay,

196
00:18:26,232 --> 00:18:30,072
you can start bidding now
through the staff at your table.

197
00:18:30,072 --> 00:18:33,532
I'll give you ten minutes for the auction.

198
00:18:33,532 --> 00:18:37,319
Let's start the bidding at...

199
00:18:38,026 --> 00:18:42,432
10,000 baht per drink, just for fun, of course!

200
00:18:42,432 --> 00:18:46,506
If you're in a group,
feel free to pool your money.

201
00:18:46,506 --> 00:18:50,266
Just a reminder. No holding back, no being stingy.

202
00:18:50,266 --> 00:18:54,386
This is a rare chance.

203
00:18:54,386 --> 00:18:56,919
Jay doesn't show up often!

204
00:18:56,919 --> 00:19:02,366
Auction starts now, ten minutes only!

205
00:19:02,366 --> 00:19:05,132
- Write in your bids and send them up.
- Excuse me.

206
00:19:05,132 --> 00:19:06,672
My friend's not coming.

207
00:19:06,672 --> 00:19:11,619
Oh? No worries. We'll send some of our boys over
to keep you company.

208
00:19:11,619 --> 00:19:15,459
Do you want to choose them yourself,
or should I pick for you?

209
00:19:15,459 --> 00:19:20,212
I'll choose. Bring me the top guys in this place.
Five minutes.

210
00:19:45,219 --> 00:19:46,492
Jay.

211
00:19:46,492 --> 00:19:48,926
I figured you'd be hiding out back.

212
00:19:48,926 --> 00:19:52,539
Yeah, what's up?
Heard you've been rising fast lately.

213
00:19:52,539 --> 00:19:55,480
Yeah... Got a few regulars now.

214
00:19:55,480 --> 00:19:59,280
Big spenders, nice people,
they don't cross the line.

215
00:19:59,280 --> 00:20:00,906
Good for you.

216
00:20:00,906 --> 00:20:05,052
Unlike poor Gur, he gets groped every night.

217
00:20:05,052 --> 00:20:09,652
But he's fine with it. Says it's part of the job.

218
00:20:09,652 --> 00:20:12,746
Wherever it starts, that's the way it goes.

219
00:20:12,746 --> 00:20:17,906
Me, though, I want to do what you do.
Less work, better pay.

220
00:20:17,906 --> 00:20:21,419
No touching, and people respect me.

221
00:20:21,419 --> 00:20:23,226
You can do it.

222
00:20:23,226 --> 00:20:26,746
Be sweet, give them your full attention,
but don't overdo it.

223
00:20:26,746 --> 00:20:31,672
Set boundaries early.
After a while, they'll respect that.

224
00:20:31,672 --> 00:20:33,379
Got it, thanks, bro.

225
00:20:34,608 --> 00:20:36,126
Bew!

226
00:20:36,126 --> 00:20:38,439
PR is calling.

227
00:20:38,439 --> 00:20:42,679
They've got a new client
who wants all the top hosts.

228
00:20:42,679 --> 00:20:44,506
On it.

229
00:20:44,506 --> 00:20:46,066
Catch you later, Jay.

230
00:20:46,066 --> 00:20:47,999
See you later.

231
00:20:49,292 --> 00:20:51,546
I was just talking with Jay.

232
00:20:51,546 --> 00:20:53,492
I always gotta be the one calling him over.

233
00:20:53,492 --> 00:20:55,554
Chill, chill. Let's go.

234
00:21:05,659 --> 00:21:07,592
So, what do you think, miss?

235
00:21:07,592 --> 00:21:10,400
Enjoying our boys?

236
00:21:10,400 --> 00:21:12,312
Have you picked anyone yet?

237
00:21:12,312 --> 00:21:15,879
If not, take your time.

238
00:21:15,879 --> 00:21:20,324
I'll just go announce Jay's drink auction.

239
00:21:20,324 --> 00:21:21,992
Wait.

240
00:21:21,992 --> 00:21:23,359
Yes?

241
00:21:25,560 --> 00:21:27,820
I'd like to place a bid.

242
00:21:36,667 --> 00:21:39,653
Alright, everyone!

243
00:21:39,653 --> 00:21:47,753
Let's see who'll win a drink with Jay tonight.

244
00:21:52,413 --> 00:21:57,620
All bids are in my hands now.

245
00:21:57,620 --> 00:22:02,940
Let's start with Table 4.

246
00:22:02,940 --> 00:22:07,160
They've bid 30,000 baht.

247
00:22:08,327 --> 00:22:15,380
Table 2 combined their offer to 50,000.

248
00:22:16,493 --> 00:22:22,600
Next, Table 6, 20,000 baht.

249
00:22:22,600 --> 00:22:25,277
Ah, a little low, but appreciated!

250
00:22:25,277 --> 00:22:32,860
But just in, hot off the press,
I just got a new bid.

251
00:22:32,860 --> 00:22:36,867
Table 1. She came alone, but bold as ever.

252
00:22:36,867 --> 00:22:42,553
100,000 baht!
[Table 1:100,000]

253
00:22:42,553 --> 00:22:47,080
Amazing! Truly fearless!

254
00:22:47,080 --> 00:22:55,367
Tonight, Jay will have a drink
with our winner at Table 1!

255
00:23:10,440 --> 00:23:14,293
Any tables here not interested
in bidding for me tonight?

256
00:23:14,293 --> 00:23:16,733
- This one.
- This table?

257
00:23:16,733 --> 00:23:18,673
And theirs too.

258
00:23:18,673 --> 00:23:21,420
Alright.

259
00:23:22,047 --> 00:23:26,820
I'm giving up the 100,000 baht from Table 1.

260
00:23:26,820 --> 00:23:30,553
Tonight, I want to spend time with the women
who didn't bid on me.

261
00:23:30,553 --> 00:23:33,700
Wow!

262
00:24:00,887 --> 00:24:03,820
You!

263
00:24:04,867 --> 00:24:06,540
You!

264
00:24:07,353 --> 00:24:10,173
I came to a place like this
just to ask for your help!

265
00:24:10,173 --> 00:24:12,147
A place like this?

266
00:24:12,147 --> 00:24:15,040
You make it sound disgusting.

267
00:24:15,760 --> 00:24:18,367
Do you even know this place?

268
00:24:18,367 --> 00:24:20,953
Some people work here to pay their tuition.

269
00:24:20,953 --> 00:24:23,627
Some support their parents.

270
00:24:23,627 --> 00:24:26,747
Everyone here works for a living,
just like anyone else.

271
00:24:26,747 --> 00:24:31,472
The women who come here?
They come with their own mindset.

272
00:24:31,472 --> 00:24:34,546
And who do you think you are?

273
00:24:34,546 --> 00:24:37,459
Where do you get off talking
like you're so superior?

274
00:24:38,912 --> 00:24:41,766
If you want someone to be professional,

275
00:24:41,766 --> 00:24:45,819
you need to show respect
for their professionalism too.

276
00:24:47,639 --> 00:24:50,819
People who don't get it just don't get it.

277
00:24:50,819 --> 00:24:53,079
I'm not superior.

278
00:24:53,079 --> 00:24:56,952
I'm not someone who looks down on others.

279
00:24:56,952 --> 00:25:01,546
I just don't like the women who come here.

280
00:25:05,846 --> 00:25:10,412
But if my words sounded condescending,
I'm truly sorry.

281
00:25:10,412 --> 00:25:13,132
Really.

282
00:25:13,132 --> 00:25:15,246
Please, take the job.

283
00:25:15,246 --> 00:25:17,272
I need you.

284
00:25:51,592 --> 00:25:53,472
What do you even do for a living?

285
00:25:53,472 --> 00:25:56,359
I'm a real estate agent.

286
00:25:56,359 --> 00:26:00,672
Just forget about what happened on the island.

287
00:26:00,672 --> 00:26:05,406
Whatever happened, it's over now.
Things come and go.

288
00:26:05,406 --> 00:26:09,626
No need to feel like
we owe each other anything, okay?

289
00:26:11,559 --> 00:26:16,839
Are you sure you don't feel anything anymore?

290
00:26:18,759 --> 00:26:21,806
Of course. What, you think I'm hung up on you?

291
00:26:21,806 --> 00:26:27,219
If not, then why did you
go to that art exhibition?

292
00:26:31,292 --> 00:26:35,586
If you really didn't feel anything,
why were you there?

293
00:26:35,586 --> 00:26:41,672
You know it was the only place
we could've run into each other.

294
00:26:41,672 --> 00:26:43,872
You went?

295
00:26:43,872 --> 00:26:45,953
Yeah.

296
00:26:45,953 --> 00:26:47,932
I saw you.

297
00:26:51,479 --> 00:26:55,152
I was just looking at art. That's all.

298
00:26:55,152 --> 00:27:01,512
Hey, it was just a one-night stand, right?

299
00:27:09,440 --> 00:27:11,580
Exactly.

300
00:27:12,412 --> 00:27:14,539
Cool.

301
00:27:14,539 --> 00:27:16,412
Then I'll take the job.

302
00:27:17,172 --> 00:27:20,286
You bid 100,000 baht for me earlier, right?

303
00:27:20,286 --> 00:27:23,039
Let's stick with that, triple the rate.

304
00:27:24,086 --> 00:27:26,826
I'll have Tiwa contact you.

305
00:27:27,481 --> 00:27:32,099
And I'll need the name and occupation
of the client I'll be handling.

306
00:27:32,099 --> 00:27:33,932
Miss Pitcha.

307
00:28:02,712 --> 00:28:04,499
Wow.

308
00:28:07,786 --> 00:28:13,106
Three million just for his fee,
plus hotels, flights, meals...

309
00:28:13,106 --> 00:28:16,186
I'm basically broke now.

310
00:28:17,578 --> 00:28:22,546
Ganesh... Uma Devi... please help me.

311
00:28:35,032 --> 00:28:38,379
How much did you make tonight, bro?

312
00:28:39,899 --> 00:28:41,406
A little over ten thousand.

313
00:28:41,406 --> 00:28:43,619
That's a lot!

314
00:28:43,619 --> 00:28:45,526
Still not enough for my next face treatment.

315
00:28:45,526 --> 00:28:49,319
Bro, seriously,
move out of that luxury condo already.

316
00:28:49,319 --> 00:28:52,292
Your rent is insane.

317
00:28:55,526 --> 00:28:59,779
If the condo's not fancy, no one books me.

318
00:29:00,699 --> 00:29:02,586
Wait.

319
00:29:04,512 --> 00:29:07,779
You're meeting clients in private now?

320
00:29:07,779 --> 00:29:11,619
What was I supposed to do? They asked for it.

321
00:29:12,239 --> 00:29:16,559
But don't tell Tiwa, I'll get killed.

322
00:29:16,559 --> 00:29:19,972
Didn't Jay say it wasn't worth it?

323
00:29:19,972 --> 00:29:24,386
Jay can talk.
He's so famous he turns down six-figure bids.

324
00:29:24,386 --> 00:29:25,979
Must be nice.

325
00:29:36,779 --> 00:29:38,892
At least...

326
00:29:39,892 --> 00:29:44,206
take the money to pay for your fancy condo, right?

327
00:29:44,206 --> 00:29:49,386
Or if you don't want her cash,
give it to the boys.

328
00:29:49,386 --> 00:29:52,299
Some of them still need tuition money.

329
00:29:55,859 --> 00:30:01,632
Be honest, did you know that Pitcha girl before?

330
00:30:01,632 --> 00:30:03,552
You both act super weird around each other.

331
00:30:03,552 --> 00:30:05,339
No.

332
00:30:06,586 --> 00:30:11,179
And stop complaining about the money.
I said yes to the job already.

333
00:30:13,499 --> 00:30:15,719
- Wait, really?
- Yeah.

334
00:30:15,719 --> 00:30:18,152
Told her 300,000 per day.

335
00:30:18,152 --> 00:30:20,452
Tomorrow,
you can try following up with her yourself.

336
00:30:20,452 --> 00:30:24,092
Get the details before the trip.

337
00:30:24,092 --> 00:30:25,952
Alright?

338
00:30:25,952 --> 00:30:28,332
Got it. Easy.

339
00:30:36,946 --> 00:30:39,139
Why didn't you tell me earlier?

340
00:31:21,026 --> 00:31:23,572
Oh, you're the one from the appointment?

341
00:31:23,572 --> 00:31:25,286
What's your name again?

342
00:31:25,286 --> 00:31:28,519
Hello, I'm Jira.

343
00:31:28,519 --> 00:31:30,179
Alright, have a seat.

344
00:31:32,752 --> 00:31:35,459
So, who referred you?

345
00:31:35,459 --> 00:31:37,579
A friend recommended me.

346
00:31:40,415 --> 00:31:44,939
Just so you know,
we don't accept people with addictions,

347
00:31:44,939 --> 00:31:49,186
drugs, gambling, football betting, gaming,
luxury addiction, brand-obsessed,

348
00:31:49,186 --> 00:31:53,252
get-rich-quick schemes, scams, none of that.

349
00:31:54,516 --> 00:31:57,432
I'm only addicted to debt, ma'am.

350
00:31:57,432 --> 00:31:58,792
Debt?

351
00:31:58,792 --> 00:32:01,132
Yeah, family debt.

352
00:32:01,132 --> 00:32:07,179
I lost my job during COVID,
and we've had financial problems ever since.

353
00:32:09,452 --> 00:32:12,786
Good. I like that.

354
00:32:12,786 --> 00:32:17,452
People who want to pay off family debt
usually work hard.

355
00:32:18,486 --> 00:32:19,666
Got a wife?

356
00:32:19,666 --> 00:32:21,212
No, ma'am.

357
00:32:23,886 --> 00:32:26,359
Even better.

358
00:32:27,412 --> 00:32:30,159
Here, there's no salary.
You earn from drink commissions.

359
00:32:30,159 --> 00:32:31,972
We take 40% cut for the house.

360
00:32:31,972 --> 00:32:36,366
Tips and gifts from customers, those are yours.

361
00:32:36,366 --> 00:32:37,713
Stay focused, work hard,

362
00:32:37,713 --> 00:32:40,499
and if your debt's not too big,
you can be free in two or three years.

363
00:32:43,139 --> 00:32:45,259
But keep your head straight.

364
00:32:45,259 --> 00:32:51,419
Some customers only want one thing.

365
00:32:57,639 --> 00:33:01,346
This job isn't about dignity,
but it puts food on the table,

366
00:33:01,346 --> 00:33:03,532
and supports those at home.

367
00:33:04,766 --> 00:33:07,939
If you're here to pay off your family's debt,
don't overthink it.

368
00:33:10,786 --> 00:33:12,706
I'll have you come in tonight, around 8 PM.

369
00:33:12,706 --> 00:33:14,986
Stay by the bar and observe.

370
00:33:15,599 --> 00:33:20,066
Watch others and learn.

372
00:33:40,059 --> 00:33:46,400
If you follow what I teach,
you'll live well one day.

373
00:33:46,400 --> 00:33:47,972
Trust me.

374
00:34:34,552 --> 00:34:37,126
Hello, Jack. This is Pitcha.

375
00:34:37,126 --> 00:34:39,446
I'll be sending over the travel details.

376
00:34:39,446 --> 00:34:41,786
I've secured Jay's schedule.

377
00:34:41,786 --> 00:34:44,072
Please pass it along to Anita for consideration.

378
00:34:44,072 --> 00:34:45,819
Thanks.

379
00:34:59,146 --> 00:35:04,186
Boss, Pitcha just sent the itinerary.

380
00:35:04,186 --> 00:35:07,492
It includes the hotel,
the van they'll use during the day,

381
00:35:07,492 --> 00:35:08,812
and the land sites we'll visit.

382
00:35:08,812 --> 00:35:11,639
You can let them know which day works best.

383
00:35:11,639 --> 00:35:16,979
Oh, and here's the photo of Jay you requested.

384
00:35:19,466 --> 00:35:22,512
Honestly, there are way better-looking guys.

385
00:35:22,512 --> 00:35:27,166
So this is the one Grace mentioned?

386
00:35:27,166 --> 00:35:30,999
Yes. She once showed off his picture.

387
00:35:30,999 --> 00:35:37,912
And he's also the guy
Lily You had to fly back for, just for dinner.

388
00:35:37,912 --> 00:35:39,639
Lily You? The multi-brand CEO?

389
00:35:39,639 --> 00:35:44,239
Yes. That same Lily You.

390
00:35:44,239 --> 00:35:47,906
She flew in and out on the same day.
Paid 200,000 yuan.

391
00:35:47,906 --> 00:35:53,379
She wanted to book him again,
but the wait list was nearly eight months.

392
00:35:54,506 --> 00:35:57,446
He spent a whole week with her last time.

393
00:35:58,499 --> 00:36:00,632
So how many days should we go for?

394
00:36:00,632 --> 00:36:03,492
Seven or ten?

395
00:36:03,492 --> 00:36:05,612
Ten days.

396
00:36:05,612 --> 00:36:11,292
Let's move quickly.
I want to make Lily You jealous.

397
00:36:11,292 --> 00:36:15,879
And I want Grace to scream in envy.

398
00:36:15,879 --> 00:36:18,586
Got it, Boss.

399
00:36:20,480 --> 00:36:21,720
[Suvarnabhumi Airport]

[International Arrivals, Gate B]

401
00:36:48,066 --> 00:36:51,846
Hello, Tiwa? I haven't been able to reach Jay.

402
00:36:51,846 --> 00:36:54,759
He's supposed to be here with me
to welcome Anita by now.

403
00:36:54,759 --> 00:36:57,292
Huh? He's already there waiting for Anita.

404
00:36:57,292 --> 00:37:00,379
Huh? Where exactly?

405
00:37:24,212 --> 00:37:26,779
How was the flight? Tired?

406
00:37:28,752 --> 00:37:33,672
A little. How did you know I can speak Thai?

407
00:37:33,672 --> 00:37:35,959
I also know this is your favorite snack.

[Cotton Candy Roti]

409
00:37:48,419 --> 00:37:50,526
Try it.

410
00:37:57,726 --> 00:38:00,912
I hope these ten days
will be very satisfying for me.

411
00:38:01,626 --> 00:38:05,772
Here, enjoy the snack,
I'll take care of your bags.

412
00:38:07,986 --> 00:38:10,139
Anita.

413
00:38:10,139 --> 00:38:11,832
Lived in Thailand for several years.

414

No family information.

415
00:38:15,806 --> 00:38:18,152
Born in Dali, China.

416
00:38:25,582 --> 00:38:27,946
Hello, my name is Anita.

417
00:38:27,946 --> 00:38:31,799
I come to Thailand often,
and I really love it here.

418
00:38:31,799 --> 00:38:34,666
I think this country is a great place to invest.

419
00:38:34,666 --> 00:38:42,826
I've been to many provinces, Ayutthaya,
Rayong, Phuket, Samui, lots of places.

420
00:38:42,826 --> 00:38:47,992
But in Ayutthaya,
I especially love eating cotton candy roti.

421
00:38:47,992 --> 00:38:50,479
It's so delicious.

422
00:38:50,479 --> 00:38:55,992
It's the one thing I always want to eat
when I'm in Thailand.

423
00:39:19,212 --> 00:39:22,006
Hello, welcome!

424
00:39:22,006 --> 00:39:24,326
I'm Pitcha.

425
00:39:24,326 --> 00:39:26,426
You look much younger than I expected.

426
00:39:26,426 --> 00:39:29,966
Oh no, I'm 29 already.

427
00:39:29,966 --> 00:39:32,152
Still young.

428
00:39:32,152 --> 00:39:34,032
Shall we head to the hotel?

429
00:39:34,032 --> 00:39:38,186
We'll rest a bit,
and in the evening, we'll go on a dinner cruise.

430
00:39:38,186 --> 00:39:40,466
I'll explain the rest of the itinerary then.

431
00:39:40,466 --> 00:39:42,226
Okay.

432
00:39:42,226 --> 00:39:43,572
Let's go.

433
00:39:53,364 --> 00:39:54,852
I'm really happy.

434
00:39:54,852 --> 00:39:59,419
I love that the itinerary includes a spa day.

435
00:40:02,766 --> 00:40:05,452
Just reading your schedule is exhausting.

436
00:40:05,452 --> 00:40:07,686
You should give Anita a day to relax a bit.

437
00:40:07,686 --> 00:40:12,932
Wait, am I supposed to follow your orders?
I hired you, didn't I?

438
00:40:13,592 --> 00:40:16,399
Anita is part of my responsibility.

439
00:40:16,399 --> 00:40:18,799
You can't just have her
flying, driving, and sailing every day.

440
00:40:18,799 --> 00:40:20,706
It's too much.

441
00:40:20,706 --> 00:40:24,106
- But it's...
- Give her a rest day.

442
00:40:24,106 --> 00:40:26,679
I'll send the details for the flowers in her room.

443
00:40:26,679 --> 00:40:30,859
Tell the hotel to prepare them
as I say every day, okay?

444
00:40:32,486 --> 00:40:35,686
Will you be sitting in the front with the driver
or in the back?

445
00:40:35,686 --> 00:40:36,939
Huh?

446
00:40:36,939 --> 00:40:40,179
If you're sitting in the back,
go ahead and get in first.

447
00:40:57,099 --> 00:40:59,792
Thailand's weather is pretty hot right now.

448
00:41:22,119 --> 00:41:23,852
Wow.

449
00:41:28,079 --> 00:41:30,612
Who arranged these?

450
00:41:34,339 --> 00:41:39,539
Giving credit to yourselves, huh?
You two make a great team.

451
00:41:39,539 --> 00:41:42,199
From the cotton candy roti to now.

452
00:41:45,728 --> 00:41:47,888
Come on.

453
00:41:49,552 --> 00:41:52,212
Do you want to shower first?

454
00:41:52,212 --> 00:41:55,368
I'd rather find something cold to drink.

455
00:41:55,368 --> 00:41:57,092
Okay.

456
00:41:57,092 --> 00:41:59,272
What time should we meet?

457
00:42:00,266 --> 00:42:02,239
Whenever's convenient.

458
00:42:02,239 --> 00:42:04,766
Since we have the boat to ourselves...

459
00:42:05,666 --> 00:42:08,806
No rush.
