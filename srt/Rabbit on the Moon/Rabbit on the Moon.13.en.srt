1
00:01:24,320 --> 00:01:27,720
Why am I not surprised to see you here, Pitcha?

2
00:01:27,720 --> 00:01:30,720
I have something I'd like to talk to you about.

3
00:01:30,720 --> 00:01:33,413
Sorry for showing up out of the blue.

4
00:01:34,486 --> 00:01:37,193
Well, I have something to say too.

5
00:01:55,600 --> 00:01:57,920
Go ahead.

6
00:01:57,920 --> 00:02:02,566
Did you let another agent take over my job?

7
00:02:02,566 --> 00:02:07,193
If you're talking about Mr. Anan and Kat, yes.

8
00:02:08,013 --> 00:02:14,033
I gave you a chance to be my agent once.
I can give it to someone else, too.

9
00:02:14,033 --> 00:02:16,600
And what about after this?

10
00:02:16,600 --> 00:02:19,326
After this, what?

11
00:02:19,326 --> 00:02:22,733
Am I still your Thai agent or not?

12
00:02:23,526 --> 00:02:26,033
I don't think so.

13
00:02:26,033 --> 00:02:28,733
You made me unhappy.

14
00:02:28,733 --> 00:02:34,560
If this is about Jay,
I think it's not really fair.

15
00:02:34,560 --> 00:02:37,253
I don't need to be fair.

16
00:02:37,938 --> 00:02:42,178
I got to where I am because I'm good.

17
00:02:42,960 --> 00:02:45,373
Good in a way that...

18
00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:51,500
if you cross me, you're out of this industry.

19
00:02:52,540 --> 00:02:55,813
But if you still want to work with me...

20
00:02:56,800 --> 00:02:59,767
you have to cut Jay off.

21
00:03:00,593 --> 00:03:05,253
Completely. No more contact.

22
00:03:08,533 --> 00:03:12,740
You don't have the right
to tell me who I can or can't be with.

23
00:03:14,253 --> 00:03:16,253
Pitcha.

24
00:03:16,920 --> 00:03:19,440
You're not important enough
to push back like this.

25
00:03:19,440 --> 00:03:21,627
Don't you know that?

26
00:03:22,673 --> 00:03:32,193
You still have a long way to go
before you're someone people have to bow down to,

27
00:03:33,280 --> 00:03:39,647
no matter what you do.

28
00:03:40,320 --> 00:03:47,487
I've been around long enough to know
what matters, and what's worth caring about.

29
00:03:53,400 --> 00:04:01,000
If Jay didn't have you,
he might have understood what I gave him.

30
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:05,000
It wasn't about money, it was about power,

31
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:08,587
about a place
where no one would dare look down on him.

32
00:04:09,487 --> 00:04:13,200
That kind of dignity you could never give him.

33
00:04:13,200 --> 00:04:14,900
Because you...

34
00:04:16,880 --> 00:04:18,993
you're small.

35
00:04:32,266 --> 00:04:35,053
<i>I got to where I am because I'm good.</i>

36
00:04:35,053 --> 00:04:38,806
<i>And if you mess with me, you're out.</i>

37
00:04:38,806 --> 00:04:42,533
<i>You're getting nowhere in life, just admit it.</i>

38
00:04:42,533 --> 00:04:44,713
<i>Loser!</i>

39
00:04:55,853 --> 00:04:58,333
<i>Wow, you're calling me.</i>

40
00:04:58,333 --> 00:05:00,653
I wanted to talk business.

41
00:05:00,653 --> 00:05:03,820
<i>Sure. When? Today?</i>

42
00:05:03,820 --> 00:05:06,860
Yes, send me the location.

43
00:06:32,741 --> 00:06:36,926
Actually, I won't come inside. I'm soaked.

44
00:06:36,926 --> 00:06:39,013
But I wanted to talk a bit.

45
00:06:39,013 --> 00:06:41,660
You don't just look wet.

46
00:06:41,660 --> 00:06:44,953
You look like you need a stiff drink.

47
00:06:44,953 --> 00:06:48,053
Come in. I've got towels.

48
00:06:48,053 --> 00:06:49,793
Please.

49
00:07:16,220 --> 00:07:17,673
What is it?

50
00:07:17,673 --> 00:07:22,033
<i>I think Jay might be heading back
to Bangkok again.</i>

51
00:07:23,783 --> 00:07:26,220
Did he ask about me?

52
00:07:26,220 --> 00:07:30,826
Yes. I mean, he seemed worried about you.

53
00:07:30,826 --> 00:07:33,173
Not as much as he worries about Pitcha, I bet.

54
00:07:34,400 --> 00:07:39,840
Should I tell him where you're staying?

55
00:07:39,840 --> 00:07:42,533
Sure, might as well get it over with.

56
00:07:43,680 --> 00:07:49,000
Also, find out which flight he's on so I can plan.

57
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:53,447
And stop by the house. See what he brought back.

58
00:07:53,447 --> 00:07:55,500
Okay.

59
00:08:46,760 --> 00:08:49,507
Dry your hair, drink some tea.
Want some antihistamines?

60
00:08:50,413 --> 00:08:54,107
No need. I won't stay long.

61
00:08:57,720 --> 00:08:59,700
What happened?

62
00:08:59,700 --> 00:09:01,727
Want to talk about it?

63
00:09:02,546 --> 00:09:05,219
Business can wait.

64
00:09:07,834 --> 00:09:09,767
Go ahead.

65
00:09:15,774 --> 00:09:23,149
I want to use all the land I have,
which, trust me, is beautiful, to invest with you.

66
00:09:23,149 --> 00:09:26,280
Like a holistic concept. What do you think?

67
00:09:26,280 --> 00:09:27,760
Like what, exactly?

68
00:09:27,760 --> 00:09:30,262
You can't just ask that vaguely.

69
00:09:30,262 --> 00:09:34,080
You'd need a marketing plan and research.

70
00:09:34,080 --> 00:09:37,133
Unless you already know what you want to do.

71
00:09:37,133 --> 00:09:40,480
I've got land perfect for
spiritual or healing retreats.

72
00:09:40,480 --> 00:09:43,173
It's really on trend right now.

73
00:09:43,173 --> 00:09:48,140
It's a luxury business, high-ticket, trendy.

74
00:09:48,140 --> 00:09:56,027
And I've got land great, for building attractions,
photo studios, indoor-outdoor setups

75
00:09:56,027 --> 00:09:59,664
for influencers and events.

76
00:09:59,664 --> 00:10:03,860
Sounds trendy but maybe not long-term?

77
00:10:03,860 --> 00:10:05,420
Some of them, yes.

78
00:10:05,420 --> 00:10:10,167
So you want a partner
to build the businesses on the land.

79
00:10:10,167 --> 00:10:13,360
You don't just want
to be a real estate broker anymore.

80
00:10:15,099 --> 00:10:19,760
I used to want to be a real estate mogul.

81
00:10:19,760 --> 00:10:24,093
But now I realize I'm not suited for that.

82
00:10:24,093 --> 00:10:27,060
I don't want to be cruel to others, or to myself.

83
00:10:27,060 --> 00:10:30,340
I don't want to do what people expect from me.

84
00:10:30,340 --> 00:10:33,720
I want to be what I want to be.

85
00:10:35,520 --> 00:10:38,760
I know only a few investors
who have money and taste,

86
00:10:38,760 --> 00:10:41,820
and you're one of them.

87
00:10:41,820 --> 00:10:45,987
If you're interested,
I'll put together a proposal.

88
00:10:50,493 --> 00:10:53,242
Sure, go ahead.

89
00:10:53,242 --> 00:10:56,607
But if it's not the right fit, I'll turn it down.

90
00:10:56,607 --> 00:11:01,620
I'm not rich enough
to fund people's dreams just because.

91
00:11:01,620 --> 00:11:04,860
That's exactly why I chose you.

92
00:11:04,860 --> 00:11:07,347
Give me a week.

93
00:11:07,347 --> 00:11:11,533
And thank you, really, for meeting me today.

94
00:11:11,533 --> 00:11:13,573
Thanks a lot.

95
00:11:18,859 --> 00:11:20,639
Wait.

96
00:11:23,200 --> 00:11:27,840
What about the other thing I asked you?
About us talking, getting to know each other?

97
00:11:27,840 --> 00:11:29,720
Got an answer yet?

98
00:11:30,649 --> 00:11:34,560
Right now, I don't have time
to think about anything else.

99
00:11:34,560 --> 00:11:39,340
I just... want to be better.

100
00:11:41,614 --> 00:11:44,647
That's exactly why I like you.

What happened? Is Plearn okay?

What happened? Is Plearn alright?

111
00:13:47,987 --> 00:13:51,187
I came back this morning
and everything in the house was wrecked.

112
00:13:51,187 --> 00:13:53,413
Looks like she locked herself in the bathroom.

113
00:13:53,413 --> 00:13:55,940
Why didn't you break the door down?

114
00:13:55,940 --> 00:13:59,307
Calm down, Cha. She's still talking to me.

115
00:13:59,307 --> 00:14:00,996
But she won't come out.

116
00:14:00,996 --> 00:14:06,853
<i>Her voice sounds normal,
but she refuses to unlock the door.</i>

117
00:14:06,853 --> 00:14:09,640
She said she only wants to talk to you.

118
00:14:10,867 --> 00:14:15,813
Laks, can we have an ambulance
on standby just quietly?

119
00:14:15,813 --> 00:14:20,273
If it's nothing, we'll send them away.
I'll be there in about 20 minutes.

00:14:20,273 --> 00:14:22,160
Okay, okay.

00:14:37,920 --> 00:14:40,873
Plearn, do you want anything?

124
00:14:40,873 --> 00:14:42,967
She's coming.

I said I'd be back days ago and I never came.

Even if she's okay, Laks, I think we need to talk.

Was it yourself?

Why would you do this to yourself?

00:20:45,167 --> 00:20:48,247
Don't cry.

179
00:20:49,840 --> 00:20:52,140
Plearn...

180
00:20:58,940 --> 00:21:02,060
Wigs look great these days.

181
00:21:02,060 --> 00:21:05,620
No one will know, especially if it's a good brand.

182
00:21:05,620 --> 00:21:08,080
They look real.

183
00:21:11,447 --> 00:21:13,773
You know what?

184
00:21:14,927 --> 00:21:17,600
Laks never stopped.

185
00:21:19,280 --> 00:21:21,062
Even when we were dating,

186
00:21:21,062 --> 00:21:29,240
he told me he liked going out, partying,
hanging out with escort girls and all.

187
00:21:31,813 --> 00:21:35,200
But I thought once he got married, he'd stop.

188
00:21:35,200 --> 00:21:37,880
The night I asked you out,

189
00:21:37,880 --> 00:21:40,800
he was partying with his friends
at that same place.

190
00:21:41,820 --> 00:21:44,480
He's never cared about me, Cha.

191
00:21:45,720 --> 00:21:51,500
And the more he saw I could tolerate it,
the worse it got.

192
00:21:53,527 --> 00:21:59,427
He said he treated me well, had no mistress,

193
00:21:59,427 --> 00:22:05,160
and never got serious with anyone else
because he didn't need to.

194
00:22:10,760 --> 00:22:13,560
Not because he loved me, Cha.

195
00:22:14,793 --> 00:22:17,280
Because it wasn't necessary.

196
00:22:22,033 --> 00:22:27,107
What I wanted, Cha, was just the basics.

197
00:22:27,107 --> 00:22:32,440
Just to be loved, just to be respected.
That's all.

198
00:22:38,540 --> 00:22:44,360
One thing I've learned, Plearn,
is that we can't change anyone.

199
00:22:44,360 --> 00:22:49,520
Deep down,
people always know what's right or wrong.

200
00:22:50,460 --> 00:22:57,900
No one can change anyone, except themselves.

201
00:22:57,900 --> 00:23:00,613
And more importantly,

202
00:23:00,613 --> 00:23:04,040
Laks doesn't even seem to think
he's done anything wrong.

203
00:23:05,527 --> 00:23:08,387
If you can't accept this,

204
00:23:08,387 --> 00:23:11,800
then you're going to keep getting hurt
over and over again.

205
00:23:13,653 --> 00:23:21,280
And honestly, no one should have to
accept something like this in the first place.

206
00:23:24,080 --> 00:23:28,600
Tell him to stop. Be clear.

207
00:23:28,600 --> 00:23:32,260
If he doesn't stop, you'll leave him.

208
00:23:34,087 --> 00:23:36,632
I can't do that, Cha.

209
00:23:36,632 --> 00:23:40,365
My whole school is based on his family.

210
00:23:41,140 --> 00:23:44,720
We've only been married for less than a year.
You want me to end it already?

211
00:23:45,540 --> 00:23:48,400
Mom would never understand.

212
00:23:48,400 --> 00:23:54,567
If she knew how miserable you were,
maybe she wouldn't let you suffer like this.

213
00:23:54,567 --> 00:23:57,480
Don't you know Mom?

214
00:23:58,187 --> 00:24:01,507
She'll never understand something like this.

215
00:24:01,507 --> 00:24:03,540
Never.

216
00:24:11,908 --> 00:24:15,887
Okay, one step at a time.

217
00:24:15,887 --> 00:24:21,000
Pick a wig. I'll have it delivered here.

218
00:24:21,867 --> 00:24:24,973
Take a shower, get dressed, and head out.

219
00:24:24,973 --> 00:24:29,860
Don't let Laks see you like this,
don't let him know he made you like this.

220
00:24:53,347 --> 00:24:55,287
Cha.

221
00:24:57,907 --> 00:25:00,160
Thank you.

222
00:25:03,932 --> 00:25:06,720
It's just the two of us, right?

223
00:25:06,720 --> 00:25:10,280
If it were me, you'd do the same.

224
00:25:57,177 --> 00:26:00,280
Plearn cut her hair and didn't like it.

225
00:26:00,280 --> 00:26:02,347
It looks good, though.

226
00:26:02,347 --> 00:26:04,120
You know, it's a little strange

227
00:26:04,120 --> 00:26:08,100
when a woman suddenly cuts her hair short
and locks herself in the bathroom.

228
00:26:08,100 --> 00:26:10,927
I think you two should talk it out properly.

229
00:26:10,927 --> 00:26:16,607
I'm not okay with my sister having to go through
something so not okay.

230
00:26:16,607 --> 00:26:19,800
You know what I mean.

231
00:26:22,733 --> 00:26:25,500
Plearn, I'm leaving now.

232
00:26:25,500 --> 00:26:29,693
If you need anything, call me. Anytime.

233
00:26:29,693 --> 00:26:35,893
And don't forget,
Mom said to come see her tomorrow.

234
00:26:58,048 --> 00:26:59,553
What is it, Pitcha?

235
00:26:59,553 --> 00:27:02,433
<i>Mom, how about dinner tomorrow evening?</i>

236
00:27:02,433 --> 00:27:05,080
Invite Dad and Plearn too.

237
00:27:05,080 --> 00:27:06,820
Is there something wrong?

238
00:27:06,820 --> 00:27:09,217
Yes. Something's wrong with everyone, right?

239
00:27:09,217 --> 00:27:11,360
<i>Including you.</i>

240
00:27:12,107 --> 00:27:13,846
<i>Please cook something.</i>

241
00:27:13,846 --> 00:27:16,027
I'll invite Dad and Plearn myself.

242
00:27:16,027 --> 00:27:18,240
See you tomorrow.

243
00:27:26,080 --> 00:27:30,200
[Jira - Missed Call]

244
00:28:10,740 --> 00:28:14,920
You've got dinner with Mom tomorrow?
Want me to come with you?

245
00:28:18,260 --> 00:28:20,137
Do you want to come?

246
00:28:20,137 --> 00:28:23,630
I could, if you want me there.

247
00:28:25,511 --> 00:28:27,551
It's okay.

248
00:28:28,427 --> 00:28:31,440
I might need to talk to her.

249
00:28:32,586 --> 00:28:35,120
Is it about me?

250
00:28:35,120 --> 00:28:39,240
Well, maybe.

251
00:28:40,240 --> 00:28:44,200
But I'd like to think things through first.

252
00:28:46,120 --> 00:28:48,760
Honestly...

253
00:28:53,001 --> 00:28:56,161
I want to talk things through with you first.

254
00:28:59,440 --> 00:29:06,720
Can you at least try to adjust...
to being married?

255
00:29:10,895 --> 00:29:15,960
If it's about my lifestyle,
we've already talked about it, haven't we?

256
00:29:15,960 --> 00:29:19,720
I like partying. That's just who I am.

257
00:29:19,720 --> 00:29:23,440
If you love me, let me be.

258
00:29:23,440 --> 00:29:29,747
Don't overthink little things like this,
we've got a long way to go.

259
00:29:32,174 --> 00:29:35,694
If you're feeling lonely, then have a baby.

260
00:29:35,694 --> 00:29:37,720
Focus on the baby.

261
00:29:37,720 --> 00:29:44,667
Once I'm tired or older,
I'll come back to you and the kid.

262
00:29:44,667 --> 00:29:47,440
Life has its own steps, Plearn.

263
00:29:47,440 --> 00:29:52,987
Do you really think other married couples
don't go through stuff like this?

264
00:29:55,314 --> 00:30:02,035
To grow old together,
people have to go through a lot.

265
00:30:02,035 --> 00:30:04,080
Just look at your parents.

266
00:30:04,080 --> 00:30:07,347
They were flexible,
and now they're still together.

267
00:30:13,172 --> 00:30:15,345
I'm going to take a shower.

268
00:30:48,619 --> 00:30:50,957
Auntie, why are you bringing so much stuff?

269
00:30:50,957 --> 00:30:54,534
Aromatherapy, sticky rice with pork,
oranges, herbal pills,

270
00:30:54,534 --> 00:31:01,280
massage oil, sunglasses,
prayer book, chrysanthemum tea.

271
00:31:02,547 --> 00:31:05,174
Are we going to a hospital or a field trip?

272
00:31:05,174 --> 00:31:07,765
Field trip. I'm going to see Moodeng.
(A pygmy hippo that became an internet sensation)

273
00:31:07,765 --> 00:31:10,000
Right.

274
00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:12,080
It's all for you.

275
00:31:12,080 --> 00:31:14,600
Didn't want you getting hungry while waiting.

276
00:31:14,600 --> 00:31:17,040
The hospital has plenty of food, you know?

277
00:31:17,040 --> 00:31:18,613
Well, you never move.

278
00:31:18,613 --> 00:31:22,480
I go in for ages and come out,
you're still sitting in the exact same spot.

279
00:31:22,480 --> 00:31:24,386
Lift that. Quick, we're late!

280
00:31:24,386 --> 00:31:27,253
- Move it, come on!
- Got it, boss!

281
00:31:39,920 --> 00:31:41,440
Hey, Auntie.

282
00:31:41,440 --> 00:31:45,020
If I move back to Nan,
how will you get to the hospital?

283
00:31:48,800 --> 00:31:53,780
Are the hospitals in Nan any good?

284
00:31:55,707 --> 00:32:00,533
Can I build a little house on that land?

285
00:32:02,008 --> 00:32:08,880
A one-story place, fresh air, nice neighbors.

286
00:32:08,880 --> 00:32:12,313
That's all old people need.

287
00:32:12,313 --> 00:32:16,890
There are a lot of old folks with money
but no one around.

288
00:32:16,890 --> 00:32:20,243
Lots of single,
beautiful aunties like me out there.

289
00:32:21,720 --> 00:32:24,953
- Beautiful, huh?
- Beautiful.

290
00:32:24,953 --> 00:32:30,260
If I weren't, would a hot bar host
be giving me free rides to the hospital?

291
00:32:31,360 --> 00:32:35,720
- Wait, you knew?
- Of course. But I never went.

292
00:32:35,720 --> 00:32:38,040
The girls in our condo go all the time.

293
00:32:38,040 --> 00:32:40,860
They even showed me a picture of you
when you were in China.

294
00:32:41,800 --> 00:32:43,760
Hey! What are you doing?

295
00:32:43,760 --> 00:32:46,100
We're going to be late.

296
00:32:47,120 --> 00:32:49,964
Auntie, since you knew already, you're not...

297
00:32:49,964 --> 00:32:51,993
Not what?

298
00:32:52,753 --> 00:32:54,937
Like...

299
00:32:54,937 --> 00:32:58,347
Embarrassed that people know?

300
00:32:59,240 --> 00:33:02,880
Making a living these days is tough.

301
00:33:02,880 --> 00:33:05,280
You're not scamming anyone,
not selling drugs, not killing people.

302
00:33:05,280 --> 00:33:09,720
And you even have the kindness
to take some random old auntie to the hospital.

303
00:33:09,720 --> 00:33:11,920
What's there to be embarrassed about, huh?

304
00:33:13,760 --> 00:33:15,687
Let's go. You're still smiling.

305
00:33:15,687 --> 00:33:18,480
Come on, we'll be late. Drive already.

306
00:33:18,480 --> 00:33:19,600
Okay.

307
00:33:19,600 --> 00:33:23,407
Next time, take me with you to work.
I want to see those handsome guys.

308
00:33:24,020 --> 00:33:26,207
There are no handsome guys.
The most handsome one is sitting right here.

309
00:33:26,207 --> 00:33:27,740
Hey!

310
00:33:42,240 --> 00:33:43,940
Please, come in.

311
00:33:51,380 --> 00:33:54,566
You seem more relaxed today.

312
00:33:55,253 --> 00:33:58,293
I'm just being myself, not trying to be friendly.

313
00:33:58,293 --> 00:34:00,691
This is what I'm usually like.

314
00:34:01,373 --> 00:34:03,080
Have a seat.

315
00:34:13,560 --> 00:34:18,060
This is the project plan I've put together.
Let's start with the first one.

316
00:34:18,060 --> 00:34:21,107
There's this piece of land owned by a family.

317
00:34:21,107 --> 00:34:27,027
We already agreed, whether it's rented or bought,
not a single tree can be cut.

318
00:34:27,027 --> 00:34:30,280
They trust me to take care of it.

319
00:34:30,280 --> 00:34:34,480
So I asked my friend who's an architect
to take a look and sketch a rough layout.

320
00:34:34,480 --> 00:34:38,900
It's totally doable
without cutting down a single tree.

321
00:34:38,900 --> 00:34:40,480
There's beautiful indoor and outdoor space.

322
00:34:40,480 --> 00:34:44,660
The concept is an indie space
that brings together good vibes

323
00:34:44,660 --> 00:34:49,947
with a micro theater, a museum,
and a rotating exhibition area.

324
00:34:49,947 --> 00:34:54,080
But the twist?
This entire place is a no-social-media zone.

325
00:34:54,727 --> 00:34:56,800
People love flaunting their stylish lives.

326
00:34:56,800 --> 00:34:59,040
Their OOTDs.

327
00:34:59,040 --> 00:35:02,771
But if they can't post about it,
this place won't go mainstream.

328
00:35:02,771 --> 00:35:04,953
It won't go mainstream until it does.

329
00:35:04,953 --> 00:35:08,080
People want a place that makes them look beyond.

330
00:35:08,080 --> 00:35:11,146
I'm cool. I'm not addicted to social media.

331
00:35:11,146 --> 00:35:13,660
Check-in area is at the front
where they drop off their phones,

332
00:35:13,660 --> 00:35:16,767
then we wait for the word-of-mouth reviews
about how amazing it is inside.

333
00:35:16,767 --> 00:35:20,013
Then people will start flooding in.
Reservations only.

334
00:35:20,013 --> 00:35:24,273
We'll control the number of guests
to prevent overcrowding.

335
00:35:24,273 --> 00:35:28,833
Complicated. Hard to manage. Breaks all the rules.

336
00:35:28,833 --> 00:35:31,313
But isn't it interesting?

337
00:35:32,793 --> 00:35:35,007
And the contract term?

338
00:35:35,007 --> 00:35:40,920
20 years. With a 15% increase in value if renewed.

339
00:35:43,887 --> 00:35:47,595
Let me take it back for discussion.
Very interesting.

340
00:35:47,595 --> 00:35:51,180
It'll take some time.
You're proposing something big.

341
00:35:51,180 --> 00:35:53,660
Good. I want you to take it seriously.

342
00:35:53,660 --> 00:35:57,400
In the meantime,
I'll move forward with another project.

343
00:35:57,400 --> 00:35:59,033
Alright.

344
00:36:01,030 --> 00:36:03,640
Thanks. I'll set up another appointment soon.

345
00:36:03,640 --> 00:36:06,920
Wait, wait, you're just leaving like that?

346
00:36:06,920 --> 00:36:12,440
Have a meal first, chat a bit,
and discuss about this?

347
00:36:12,440 --> 00:36:17,080
Sure, but another day, okay?
I have plans with family tonight.

348
00:36:24,840 --> 00:36:27,100
Thank you so much today.

349
00:36:27,100 --> 00:36:30,293
Auntie, get some rest. You've had a long day.

350
00:36:31,800 --> 00:36:33,200
Do you want to come in?

351
00:36:33,200 --> 00:36:34,560
I've got some errands.

352
00:36:34,560 --> 00:36:38,460
I don't want to go,
but I have to get it over with.

353
00:36:38,460 --> 00:36:42,360
Alright then. Good luck.

354
00:36:42,360 --> 00:36:44,940
- Bye-bye.
- Bye.

355
00:36:59,080 --> 00:37:02,071
- <i>What's up?</i>
- On my way.

356
00:37:02,071 --> 00:37:07,551
<i>Great, I'm starving.
Once you're here, let's grab something to eat.</i>

357
00:37:52,353 --> 00:37:54,420
- Mom.
- Cha.

358
00:37:54,420 --> 00:37:55,840
Need any help?

359
00:37:55,840 --> 00:37:57,440
Nope, I got it covered.

360
00:37:57,440 --> 00:38:00,200
Why don't you call Plearn and Dad?
Ask what time they'll be here?

361
00:38:00,200 --> 00:38:02,853
So I can set up the table.

362
00:38:06,946 --> 00:38:08,913
Looks delicious, right?

363
00:38:18,680 --> 00:38:20,168
Plearn.

364
00:38:20,168 --> 00:38:22,561
Why did you cut your hair like that?

365
00:38:23,687 --> 00:38:25,987
I was just feeling bored, Mom.

366
00:38:27,177 --> 00:38:31,410
I brought your favorite dessert, by the way.
Something sweet for the end.

367
00:38:35,260 --> 00:38:37,206
Have you been here long?

368
00:38:37,206 --> 00:38:41,033
I just got here. Let me call Dad.

369
00:38:42,160 --> 00:38:44,667
What did you cook?

370
00:38:47,073 --> 00:38:49,500
All your favorite things.

371
00:38:49,500 --> 00:38:52,606
Then I'll help carry things out.

372
00:39:11,293 --> 00:39:12,993
Set it here.

373
00:39:15,053 --> 00:39:17,838
Dad said he'll be here in 15 minutes.

374
00:39:17,838 --> 00:39:22,009
Punctuality must be the hardest challenge
in your dad's life.

375
00:39:22,009 --> 00:39:24,956
Mom, it's just 15 minutes.

376
00:39:27,663 --> 00:39:31,143
Plearn, how's the school going?

377
00:39:31,800 --> 00:39:34,133
It's going well.

378
00:39:34,133 --> 00:39:36,760
If things are settling down,

379
00:39:36,760 --> 00:39:39,347
then you should start thinking
about having a baby.

380
00:39:39,347 --> 00:39:42,490
Older moms tend to have weaker babies.

381
00:39:43,177 --> 00:39:46,267
Has Laks said anything?

382
00:39:46,267 --> 00:39:49,779
Or is it you who doesn't want one?

383
00:39:49,779 --> 00:39:53,127
Marriage has its ups and downs.

384
00:39:53,127 --> 00:39:55,647
Don't focus on it.

385
00:39:55,647 --> 00:40:00,447
Have a baby, so you can concentrate on the child.

386
00:40:03,093 --> 00:40:04,993
Yes, Mom.

387
00:40:04,993 --> 00:40:07,680
Sorry I'm a bit late.

388
00:40:11,407 --> 00:40:12,573
New haircut?

389
00:40:12,573 --> 00:40:14,993
- Looks great.
- Thanks, Dad.

390
00:40:15,787 --> 00:40:18,027
Let's finally talk.

391
00:40:18,927 --> 00:40:22,760
Eat now, before the food gets cold.

392
00:40:27,540 --> 00:40:29,120
Here you go.

393
00:40:34,367 --> 00:40:37,607
Jack said you left all your stuff at my house.

394
00:40:37,607 --> 00:40:41,493
So, are you coming back for it?
Or just leaving it?

395
00:40:43,567 --> 00:40:46,347
I didn't want to impose.

396
00:40:46,347 --> 00:40:48,420
That's not an answer.

397
00:40:49,780 --> 00:40:51,593
I'm not taking it.

398
00:40:51,593 --> 00:40:54,400
I told you I don't need anything from you.

399
00:41:03,420 --> 00:41:08,640
The other day, I had an idea about your land.

400
00:41:08,640 --> 00:41:12,593
The one you said you were going back
to take care of your grandma.

401
00:41:12,593 --> 00:41:18,789
I could invest in a business there.
No need to sell me the land.

402
00:41:18,789 --> 00:41:22,053
Let's make a long-term agreement. Ten years or so.

403
00:41:22,053 --> 00:41:24,833
I'll fund the construction.

404
00:41:24,833 --> 00:41:28,307
You co-manage it as the landowner.

405
00:41:28,307 --> 00:41:32,320
We'll appraise the land value
and treat it as shares.

406
00:41:32,320 --> 00:41:36,880
We might end up with almost equal stakes.

407
00:41:38,153 --> 00:41:41,000
Think it over before you decide.

408
00:41:46,400 --> 00:41:48,307
These snacks are delicious.

409
00:41:48,307 --> 00:41:50,947
Mom's favorite.

410
00:41:50,947 --> 00:41:54,660
Then why did you barely eat any?
You've got a great figure.

411
00:41:54,660 --> 00:41:56,813
Gaining three to four kilos won't hurt.

412
00:41:56,813 --> 00:41:58,227
Oh no, thanks.

413
00:41:58,227 --> 00:42:01,667
Then if you like it,
have one more piece, won't you?

414
00:42:01,667 --> 00:42:03,493
- Bring it here.
- Don't want the kid to feel bad.

415
00:42:03,493 --> 00:42:06,280
- Thanks.
- Got it.

416
00:42:08,240 --> 00:42:10,607
What's with that face?

417
00:42:10,607 --> 00:42:13,793
You look like you're carrying
the weight of the world again.

418
00:42:13,793 --> 00:42:15,640
I'm just wondering.

419
00:42:15,640 --> 00:42:19,280
Wondering? About what now?

420
00:42:25,687 --> 00:42:29,233
I'm just wondering, is everyone really happy?

421
00:42:29,233 --> 00:42:31,420
Why would you ask something like that?

422
00:42:34,968 --> 00:42:37,067
Is everyone really only going through good things?

423
00:42:37,067 --> 00:42:40,167
Does no one have any struggles?

424
00:42:40,167 --> 00:42:43,753
Why say that? Why be dramatic?

425
00:42:43,753 --> 00:42:45,967
I'm not trying to be dramatic, Mom.

426
00:42:45,967 --> 00:42:49,007
I just want this home to be a safe space.

427
00:42:49,007 --> 00:42:53,887
Where we can talk about
what we're struggling with,

428
00:42:53,887 --> 00:42:56,927
where we can comfort and support each other.

429
00:42:56,927 --> 00:43:02,140
Not just pretend everything's always
fine and perfect.

430
00:43:02,140 --> 00:43:04,080
Pitcha!

431
00:43:08,720 --> 00:43:13,700
If no one wants to go first, I will.

432
00:43:15,920 --> 00:43:20,373
These past few months,
I've been in love with someone.

433
00:43:20,373 --> 00:43:23,120
Someone none of you would probably approve of.

434
00:43:23,120 --> 00:43:27,107
Everyone around me keeps saying
he's not right for me.

435
00:43:27,107 --> 00:43:34,520
But I feel like he's the only one in this world
who truly understands me and supports me.

436
00:43:35,920 --> 00:43:40,920
Don't tell me you're talking about
getting together with that male escort.

437
00:43:45,140 --> 00:43:49,340
Yes, Mom. His name is Jira.

438
00:43:50,040 --> 00:43:52,514
I want to be with him.

439
00:43:53,127 --> 00:44:00,507
Previously, I've tried not to,
but I've been miserable.

440
00:44:01,314 --> 00:44:07,674
And I realized sometimes the people
others think are best for us

441
00:44:07,674 --> 00:44:10,774
end up being the ones who hurt us most.

442
00:44:13,367 --> 00:44:18,460
Staying together just for the image,
it's emotionally exhausting.

443
00:44:18,460 --> 00:44:21,027
And I don't want that for myself.

444
00:44:24,654 --> 00:44:27,887
Why do we do that to ourselves?

445
00:44:30,400 --> 00:44:33,818
Don't we deserve to choose
what's truly best for us

446
00:44:33,818 --> 00:44:37,298
without worrying about how others see us?

447
00:44:40,287 --> 00:44:43,294
I want us to be a family...

448
00:44:44,247 --> 00:44:48,847
that really listens and understands each other
with love.

449
00:44:51,721 --> 00:44:56,827
Because we're family, not strangers.

450
00:45:38,200 --> 00:45:39,920
[Jira]

451
00:45:47,747 --> 00:45:49,440
Hold on a sec.

452
00:46:02,600 --> 00:46:04,120
Hello.

453
00:46:04,120 --> 00:46:09,247
Hello, where are you? I'm coming to see you.
