1
00:00:13,239 --> 00:00:14,908
It's beautiful here, right?

2
00:00:14,908 --> 00:00:17,030
The room has a great view too.

3
00:00:17,030 --> 00:00:20,556
You can see both the mountains and the pool.

4
00:00:23,306 --> 00:00:24,880
Yes.

5
00:00:26,509 --> 00:00:29,096
What happened last night?

6
00:00:29,096 --> 00:00:33,292
- Well, I...
- I saw him throw you into the water.

7
00:00:43,280 --> 00:00:45,929
Did Jay harass you?

8
00:00:47,400 --> 00:00:49,440
No, it's not like that.

9
00:00:49,440 --> 00:00:54,600
He was just angry
because there was a problem with his room.

10
00:00:58,154 --> 00:01:02,231
Even if he was angry,
that's no excuse to treat a woman like that.

11
00:01:06,179 --> 00:01:08,920
Is there more to it than just a work issue?

12
00:01:09,894 --> 00:01:12,893
No, really, that's all.

13
00:01:12,893 --> 00:01:17,144
He insisted he wouldn't sleep in the same room
with a client.

14
00:01:17,144 --> 00:01:22,417
And I accidentally said something like,
"You've been paid a lot".

15
00:01:22,417 --> 00:01:26,759
And that upset him. But he apologized already.

16
00:01:27,520 --> 00:01:32,093
Jay was that serious
about not sharing a room with me?

17
00:01:32,093 --> 00:01:33,774
Do I look that scary or something?

18
00:01:33,774 --> 00:01:39,113
No, it's just that the contract clearly states
he has to have a separate room.

19
00:01:46,573 --> 00:01:50,717
Hearing that makes me like him even more.

20
00:01:54,427 --> 00:01:57,122
So, do we have any other places to go after this?

21
00:01:57,743 --> 00:02:01,251
Tomorrow we're going to Sukhothai,
then down to Bangkok.

22
00:02:01,251 --> 00:02:04,920
The next day, we'll fly back.

23
00:02:05,787 --> 00:02:07,542
I'm not going.

24
00:02:09,120 --> 00:02:11,648
But I still want to see the place in Sukhothai.

25
00:02:11,648 --> 00:02:14,520
You go and take pictures for me.

26
00:02:14,520 --> 00:02:17,506
I want to stay here for another three days.

27
00:02:17,506 --> 00:02:19,469
Get Jay's schedule for me.

28
00:02:19,469 --> 00:02:21,611
I'll handle the cost myself.

29
00:02:21,611 --> 00:02:26,920
- I...
- If you can make it happen, I'll buy the land.

30
00:02:54,292 --> 00:02:58,354
Hello, Cha. I was just about to call you.

31
00:02:58,354 --> 00:03:01,122
About the pre-wedding shoot,
what time are we leaving Bangkok?

32
00:03:01,122 --> 00:03:04,404
So I can confirm
with the makeup artist and hair stylist.

33
00:03:04,404 --> 00:03:08,160
Plearn, can we move the date back a little?

34
00:03:08,160 --> 00:03:11,732
My client asked to stay for another three days.

35
00:03:11,732 --> 00:03:14,593
What? No, Cha. That's not possible.

36
00:03:14,593 --> 00:03:16,988
Laks doesn't have much free time either.

37
00:03:16,988 --> 00:03:19,049
I've already confirmed everything.

38
00:03:19,049 --> 00:03:22,961
And reporters are coming
to shoot behind-the-scenes footage too.

39
00:03:22,961 --> 00:03:26,953
An appointment is an appointment.
We can't reschedule.

40
00:03:26,953 --> 00:03:31,698
- Plearn...
- I don't care what your client wants.

41
00:03:31,698 --> 00:03:35,773
- You have to do what we agreed.
- This is important...

42
00:03:47,140 --> 00:03:50,833
Actually, it can be rescheduled.
We just need a new date.

43
00:03:50,833 --> 00:03:54,490
It's our shoot, right?
Let's pick a time that works for us.

44
00:03:54,490 --> 00:03:58,291
And this is the date that works, for us.

45
00:03:58,291 --> 00:04:03,160
She's been spoiled and flaky since she was a kid,
and always getting her priorities wrong.

46
00:04:03,160 --> 00:04:06,160
But you didn't even ask
if she had anything important.

47
00:04:06,160 --> 00:04:08,786
Maybe she really does have
something major going on.

48
00:04:08,786 --> 00:04:12,263
What could possibly be more important
than her sister getting married?

49
00:04:13,174 --> 00:04:19,036
And besides, it's rare that I ask her for help.

50
00:04:19,036 --> 00:04:23,328
If Mom finds out, you're dead, Pitcha.

51
00:04:27,772 --> 00:04:31,019
Excuse me, I ordered the steak medium rare.

52
00:04:31,019 --> 00:04:32,793
This is overcooked.

53
00:04:32,793 --> 00:04:34,489
Make it again.

54
00:04:34,489 --> 00:04:36,604
I'm sorry.

55
00:04:52,260 --> 00:04:55,108
Hey, are you okay?

56
00:04:55,108 --> 00:04:58,208
What did Anita say to you?

57
00:04:58,208 --> 00:05:03,582
She asked if you did anything to me last night.

58
00:05:03,582 --> 00:05:05,188
Huh? She saw?

59
00:05:05,188 --> 00:05:06,767
Yeah.

60
00:05:07,828 --> 00:05:09,388
Crap.

61
00:05:09,388 --> 00:05:15,998
So I told her you were serious
about not sharing a room with a client.

62
00:05:15,998 --> 00:05:18,370
Well, that's true. Good. Why?

63
00:05:18,370 --> 00:05:20,878
Now she likes you even more.

64
00:05:20,878 --> 00:05:23,022
She said she won't visit the next property.

65
00:05:23,022 --> 00:05:24,743
She's staying here for three more nights.

66
00:05:24,743 --> 00:05:26,228
What?

67
00:05:28,617 --> 00:05:32,034
She said to get your schedule.

68
00:05:32,034 --> 00:05:35,360
Name your price, she'll pay.

69
00:05:37,213 --> 00:05:39,421
This is getting worse and worse...

70
00:05:43,260 --> 00:05:46,182
I don't know. If I stay, you'll have to stay too.

71
00:05:48,621 --> 00:05:50,800
I can't.

72
00:05:50,800 --> 00:05:54,642
I have to take my sister
for her pre-wedding shoot.

73
00:05:54,642 --> 00:05:58,418
Everything's scheduled.
I just tried calling to delay it.

74
00:05:58,418 --> 00:06:00,980
And I got completely chewed out.

75
00:06:01,963 --> 00:06:04,880
Tell your sister her fiancé took a bar host
on a trip.

76
00:06:04,880 --> 00:06:07,673
- Then she won't want to go.
- Are you crazy?

77
00:06:08,984 --> 00:06:11,000
Anita said...

78
00:06:11,622 --> 00:06:17,561
She'd buy the land from me... if you stay.

79
00:06:24,283 --> 00:06:29,880
So now I'm a bargaining chip
in your business deal?

80
00:06:37,447 --> 00:06:45,166
Hey... You... Hey...

81
00:06:45,166 --> 00:06:50,374
Please, I'm begging you. Stay another three days.

82
00:06:50,374 --> 00:06:51,860
Please, please.

83
00:06:51,860 --> 00:06:54,849
If I don't sell the land,

84
00:06:54,849 --> 00:06:58,849
my mom's going to make me quit,
and go back to work with my sister.

85
00:06:58,849 --> 00:07:02,068
You're this old
and still have to listen to your mom?

86
00:07:03,032 --> 00:07:04,768
Why put up with it?

87
00:07:04,768 --> 00:07:07,718
Because it's not just my mom,
it's my dad and sister too.

88
00:07:07,718 --> 00:07:10,772
How could I not give in?

89
00:07:10,772 --> 00:07:15,709
Even you give in to your grandma, don't you?

90
00:07:17,926 --> 00:07:20,160
True.

91
00:07:20,160 --> 00:07:24,892
I'm like the black sheep of the family.

92
00:07:24,892 --> 00:07:28,540
My sister was born with a check mark.

93
00:07:28,540 --> 00:07:31,459
I was born with an X.

94
00:07:31,459 --> 00:07:33,600
The only wrong one in the family.

95
00:07:33,600 --> 00:07:38,430
Everyone else got the tick marks.

96
00:07:38,430 --> 00:07:42,941
Only I got the red cross. Just me.

97
00:07:44,680 --> 00:07:49,809
This is really my last chance.

98
00:08:04,006 --> 00:08:07,851
Alright, alright, I'll stay.
But I'm gonna tell Hia Tiw to charge a high rate.

99
00:08:07,851 --> 00:08:10,034
You sure you won't have to pay for it yourself?

100
00:08:10,034 --> 00:08:13,724
Thank you so much! Thank you, really, thank you!

101
00:08:13,724 --> 00:08:17,097
I'll bow down to you. Bow, bow, bow.

102
00:08:17,097 --> 00:08:19,913
And if you manage to sell the land,
you'll treat me to a big celebration.

103
00:08:19,913 --> 00:08:22,892
Deal. Three days and three nights, let's go.

104
00:08:22,892 --> 00:08:26,458
Thanks again. Really, thank you.

105
00:08:56,723 --> 00:09:00,283
Okay, it's settled then.
I'll come back tomorrow before Anita wakes up.

106
00:09:00,283 --> 00:09:02,117
See you then.

107
00:09:02,117 --> 00:09:03,405
Bye.

108
00:09:05,558 --> 00:09:07,233
Yes!

109
00:10:23,377 --> 00:10:26,320
Hello, the client wants to extend
for three more days.

110
00:10:26,320 --> 00:10:27,937
I'm okay with it.

111
00:10:28,920 --> 00:10:30,754
- Seriously?
- Yeah, really.

112
00:10:30,754 --> 00:10:33,607
Just name your price, she won't negotiate.

113
00:10:33,607 --> 00:10:35,358
You're a legend.

114
00:10:35,358 --> 00:10:36,520
Didn't I tell you?

115
00:10:36,520 --> 00:10:38,758
If there's a chance to make money,
then go all out.

116
00:10:38,758 --> 00:10:40,953
Alright, alright, that's it.

117
00:10:58,760 --> 00:11:00,080
[Smile]

118
00:11:29,403 --> 00:11:31,127
Yes?

119
00:11:31,127 --> 00:11:33,840
Sit. We need to talk.

120
00:11:43,074 --> 00:11:45,427
You took the client to your room?

121
00:11:48,152 --> 00:11:50,226
Didn't I already warn you?

122
00:11:50,226 --> 00:11:53,014
When your pants come off, your charm vanishes.

123
00:11:55,440 --> 00:11:57,249
Do you like her, or does she like you?

124
00:11:57,249 --> 00:11:59,840
Or is it nothing like that, just hooking up?

125
00:12:01,612 --> 00:12:03,417
Ma'am...

126
00:12:03,417 --> 00:12:05,886
I tried to avoid it, I really did.
But the client...

127
00:12:05,886 --> 00:12:09,153
I know. You think I don't know?

128
00:12:09,153 --> 00:12:12,964
I've seen this
since before the word 'host boy' even existed.

129
00:12:12,964 --> 00:12:16,056
That's why I know, it never works.

130
00:12:18,178 --> 00:12:19,842
Sorry.

131
00:12:19,842 --> 00:12:25,400
You can be horny or whatever, Gur,
but do it in the right place.

132
00:12:25,400 --> 00:12:30,440
There are places that allow that, but not here.

133
00:12:36,396 --> 00:12:38,533
Did she give you money?

134
00:12:45,488 --> 00:12:48,132
She bought me a few things.

135
00:12:49,480 --> 00:12:52,842
There. You're finished.

136
00:12:52,842 --> 00:12:55,989
Act like this and you'll never get a higher rate.

137
00:12:58,250 --> 00:13:00,046
Let me tell you something.

138
00:13:00,046 --> 00:13:02,637
Jay just called me.

139
00:13:02,637 --> 00:13:06,654
Said his client booked him for three more days.
No price limit.

140
00:13:06,654 --> 00:13:09,453
No price limit, Gur.

141
00:13:09,453 --> 00:13:12,947
I asked him,
"How'd you get her to be that satisfied?"

142
00:13:12,947 --> 00:13:14,692
Know what he said?

143
00:13:16,203 --> 00:13:18,680
Because he refused
to sleep in the same room with her.

144
00:13:20,808 --> 00:13:24,516
See? Simple.

145
00:13:29,371 --> 00:13:32,439
You can go to the kind of place
that lets you do this.

146
00:13:32,439 --> 00:13:36,092
Go be a massage boy
if you want to cheapen yourself.

147
00:13:36,092 --> 00:13:38,487
Start today if you want. I'll let you.

148
00:13:40,837 --> 00:13:42,360
Ma'am...

149
00:13:43,866 --> 00:13:45,786
I'm sorry.

150
00:13:46,697 --> 00:13:48,406
I won't do it again.

151
00:13:52,356 --> 00:13:55,396
No second chances. I'm warning you.

152
00:13:58,534 --> 00:13:59,980
Yes, ma'am.

153
00:14:05,963 --> 00:14:08,548
Work is so stressful.

154
00:14:08,548 --> 00:14:10,977
It's alright.
I'll give you a massage to relieve the stress.

155
00:14:10,977 --> 00:14:13,292
- So tense.
- Alright.

156
00:14:14,247 --> 00:14:16,713
- I'm also sore.
- Got it.

157
00:14:17,435 --> 00:14:21,604
Excuse me, may I borrow Bew for a moment?

158
00:14:21,604 --> 00:14:23,688
- Please excuse us.
- Don't be long.

159
00:14:23,688 --> 00:14:26,464
What the hell, Gur?
Seriously, have you no sense of timing?

160
00:14:26,464 --> 00:14:29,313
I'm with a client. Didn't you see?

161
00:14:31,113 --> 00:14:33,080
Did you tell Tiw about me and the client?

162
00:14:33,080 --> 00:14:35,041
Come on, I had nothing to do with it.
Why would I tell her?

163
00:14:35,041 --> 00:14:36,357
If not you, then who?

164
00:14:36,357 --> 00:14:39,026
How should I know?

165
00:14:39,026 --> 00:14:42,399
Damn, who the hell stuck their nose
into my business?

166
00:14:42,399 --> 00:14:45,877
Gur, sometimes the clients talk among themselves,
don't they?

167
00:14:45,877 --> 00:14:47,697
Like saying they got together with you
or something?

168
00:14:47,697 --> 00:14:50,680
So it's not hard for Tiw to find out.

169
00:14:51,370 --> 00:14:55,000
I warned you, didn't I?
Don't let anyone dig into your business.

170
00:14:56,523 --> 00:14:59,143
And next time, don't drag me into it.

171
00:14:59,143 --> 00:15:01,007
I don't like it.

172
00:15:14,337 --> 00:15:17,371
Hello, Maprang? Are you free?

173
00:15:19,532 --> 00:15:22,217
Wanna grab a beer?

174
00:15:23,493 --> 00:15:26,567
Anywhere's fine. My treat.

175
00:15:27,958 --> 00:15:31,232
Yeah, I got scolded. I don't wanna work anymore.

176
00:15:32,471 --> 00:15:35,080
Alright, see you.

177
00:15:42,429 --> 00:15:45,602
What's up? Why'd you get yelled at?

178
00:15:47,986 --> 00:15:52,560
Tiw found out I took a client to my room.

179
00:15:52,560 --> 00:15:55,110
Man, that's my personal business, no?

180
00:15:55,110 --> 00:15:59,319
It's the bar's rule.
She had every right to scold you.

181
00:15:59,958 --> 00:16:04,343
At Bar Smile, if you're not famous,
you won't get rich.

182
00:16:06,529 --> 00:16:10,479
You must've done it often, huh?
That's why she caught you.

183
00:16:11,529 --> 00:16:16,546
Not really. I just said something in passing,
so the client knew what I wanted.

184
00:16:16,546 --> 00:16:20,038
The next day,
they showed up at my door with gifts.

185
00:16:20,038 --> 00:16:23,557
Do I get them kicked out, just like that?

186
00:16:23,557 --> 00:16:28,083
Come on, how would they even know
where your place is if you didn't take them first?

187
00:16:28,789 --> 00:16:31,791
Without this approach, there's nothing.

188
00:16:31,791 --> 00:16:34,897
If you don't start by flirting, then how?

189
00:16:37,074 --> 00:16:39,570
And that condo we were betting on?

190
00:16:39,570 --> 00:16:42,548
I'll never get it at this rate.

191
00:16:47,231 --> 00:16:51,358
If I were your client, someone like me,
could I go to your room?

192
00:17:01,969 --> 00:17:03,582
You rich?

193
00:17:04,427 --> 00:17:06,311
If you're rich, sure.

194
00:17:07,724 --> 00:17:10,407
Okay then. Just watch.

195
00:17:10,407 --> 00:17:12,160
One day, I'll be filthy rich,

196
00:17:12,160 --> 00:17:15,400
and show up at your room
with all the luxury stuff.

197
00:17:41,870 --> 00:17:43,916
Good morning.

198
00:17:43,916 --> 00:17:46,510
Whoa.

199
00:17:52,439 --> 00:17:56,000
That's the White Orchid Tree,
Nan province's symbolic flower.

200
00:17:57,162 --> 00:17:59,127
It's beautiful.

201
00:18:01,496 --> 00:18:03,247
Have you been waiting long?

202
00:18:03,247 --> 00:18:07,813
Why didn't you call?
What if I hadn't come out until the afternoon?

203
00:18:07,813 --> 00:18:10,206
Then I'd bring out a chair and sit here waiting.

204
00:18:11,553 --> 00:18:12,843
Come on, let's have breakfast.

205
00:18:15,053 --> 00:18:17,929
Do you already know that you have to
stay with me for another three days?

206
00:18:17,929 --> 00:18:21,558
Yeah, Pitcha told me. I already called the bar.

207
00:18:21,558 --> 00:18:23,628
They're clearing my schedule.

208
00:18:23,628 --> 00:18:25,769
Do you want to stay?

209
00:18:25,769 --> 00:18:28,400
Honestly, I'm fine either way.

210
00:18:28,400 --> 00:18:33,099
If you want me to stay,
I'll go along with what the client wants.

211
00:18:33,099 --> 00:18:36,058
Good. Then let's go out today.

212
00:18:36,058 --> 00:18:40,120
Think about where you're taking me.

213
00:18:45,581 --> 00:18:48,006
I've already arranged the van.

214
00:18:48,006 --> 00:18:49,680
He'll continue to take care of you.

215
00:18:49,680 --> 00:18:53,771
I'll send the Sukhothai land video clip
to your email later tonight.

216
00:18:53,771 --> 00:18:55,874
We'll catch up after that.

217
00:18:55,874 --> 00:18:56,948
Okay.

218
00:18:56,948 --> 00:19:01,120
And I'll come back to pick you up
before your return date.

219
00:19:01,120 --> 00:19:02,770
Hope you don't mind.

220
00:19:02,770 --> 00:19:04,451
It's fine, Pitcha.

221
00:19:04,451 --> 00:19:07,172
I've got Jay to look after me.

222
00:19:09,106 --> 00:19:11,438
Thanks so much. See you soon.

223
00:19:11,438 --> 00:19:13,097
Okay.

224
00:19:23,763 --> 00:19:26,298
Do you want anything else?

225
00:19:26,298 --> 00:19:27,840
No.

226
00:19:36,448 --> 00:19:40,033
- Beautiful.
- Yeah, very beautiful.

227
00:19:40,033 --> 00:19:44,328
Yes, once I arrive, I'll go check out the land.

228
00:19:44,328 --> 00:19:47,331
Alright, see you there.

229
00:19:47,331 --> 00:19:48,880
Oh!

230
00:19:49,591 --> 00:19:51,642
What are you doing?

231
00:19:51,642 --> 00:19:53,319
You're really coming back, right?

232
00:19:53,319 --> 00:19:57,180
Of course, I have to come back to pick you all up.
Where's Anita?

233
00:19:57,180 --> 00:19:58,828
Changing her clothes.

234
00:19:59,689 --> 00:20:01,920
Come back quickly, okay?

235
00:20:01,920 --> 00:20:04,219
Yeah, okay.

236
00:20:04,219 --> 00:20:06,040
Promise me.

237
00:20:08,990 --> 00:20:13,461
Is this really necessary, Mr. Jira... wait, Jay?

238
00:20:13,461 --> 00:20:17,638
I actually like it when you call me that.

239
00:20:18,610 --> 00:20:22,261
Because honestly, I like the name Plew
more than Pitcha too.

240
00:20:24,666 --> 00:20:29,099
Then please take good care of my client, Mr. Jira.

241
00:20:31,332 --> 00:20:32,932
Take care.

242
00:20:40,404 --> 00:20:42,293
Come back soon.

243
00:20:43,210 --> 00:20:45,320
Yeah, go on.

244
00:21:04,359 --> 00:21:06,559
No, no, no. No...

245
00:21:06,559 --> 00:21:09,679
What's that? No what?

246
00:21:09,679 --> 00:21:12,600
Oh, nothing.

247
00:21:22,856 --> 00:21:27,267
The streets here really remind me of my home.

248
00:21:27,267 --> 00:21:29,462
Where's your home?

249
00:21:30,553 --> 00:21:32,634
- I live here.
- Huh?

250
00:21:32,634 --> 00:21:34,098
Here?

251
00:21:34,098 --> 00:21:35,927
You mean here in Nan?

252
00:21:35,927 --> 00:21:37,161
Yeah.

253
00:21:37,161 --> 00:21:38,621
Oh my god.

254
00:21:38,621 --> 00:21:40,818
Why didn't you say anything?

255
00:21:40,818 --> 00:21:43,521
Can you take me to see your house?
I want to see it.

256
00:21:43,521 --> 00:21:44,668
Please?

257
00:21:44,668 --> 00:21:47,520
Let's not. My house is small.

258
00:21:47,520 --> 00:21:50,292
It's nothing special.
Not fit for someone like you.

259
00:21:50,292 --> 00:21:55,044
Before you say your house is nothing,
you should come see mine first.

260
00:21:56,061 --> 00:21:57,964
Take me, please?

261
00:21:57,964 --> 00:22:00,048
Please? I really want to see it.

262
00:22:00,048 --> 00:22:01,480
Please?

263
00:22:02,691 --> 00:22:04,474
Please?

264
00:22:07,186 --> 00:22:11,158
Alright, fine. But just from afar, okay?

265
00:22:11,158 --> 00:22:14,313
I don't want my family to see me with you.

266
00:22:14,313 --> 00:22:15,607
Why?

267
00:22:15,607 --> 00:22:17,857
What's wrong with being with me?

268
00:22:17,857 --> 00:22:20,573
They don't know what I do for a living.

269
00:22:20,573 --> 00:22:22,359
I don't want them asking questions.

270
00:22:22,359 --> 00:22:26,922
If you want to go, I'll take you,
but we'll look from a distance, okay?

271
00:22:29,732 --> 00:22:32,787
Okay. From a distance is fine.

272
00:22:32,787 --> 00:22:34,548
Okay.

273
00:22:47,361 --> 00:22:49,717
Do you see that small house over there?

274
00:22:50,318 --> 00:22:51,640
That's the house I grew up in,

275
00:22:51,640 --> 00:22:53,879
with my grandparents, my mom,
and my little sibling.

276
00:22:54,556 --> 00:22:55,887
Wow.

277
00:22:57,614 --> 00:22:59,877
It's beautiful.

278
00:22:59,877 --> 00:23:02,840
Even more beautiful
than the place Pitcha showed me.

279
00:23:05,123 --> 00:23:07,880
Actually, Pitcha came here once too.

280
00:23:09,274 --> 00:23:13,406
She came to ask my mom
if she could be a sales rep for some land.

281
00:23:13,406 --> 00:23:17,920
But we didn't meet.
And my grandma didn't agree to it.

282
00:23:19,187 --> 00:23:20,878
Why not?

283
00:23:21,856 --> 00:23:25,349
This land is in a great location.

284
00:23:26,093 --> 00:23:29,646
The view is amazing,
and it's not far from the city.

285
00:23:30,729 --> 00:23:32,381
Sell it to me?

286
00:23:32,381 --> 00:23:35,360
I'll offer you the best price.

287
00:23:35,986 --> 00:23:39,073
No. I'm not selling.

288
00:23:39,073 --> 00:23:41,518
I plan to come back and live here.

289
00:23:41,518 --> 00:23:44,686
I want to build something small of my own.

290
00:23:44,686 --> 00:23:50,043
That small thing
doesn't mean it won't cost a lot of money.

291
00:23:51,766 --> 00:23:56,681
So, what's the small thing you want to build?

292
00:23:56,681 --> 00:23:58,721
A garden?

293
00:23:58,721 --> 00:24:00,859

294

A café?

296
00:24:05,653 --> 00:24:10,168
Whatever it is,
it's going to cost at least 30 million.

297
00:24:12,240 --> 00:24:14,840
30 million, I don't have that kind of money.

298
00:24:15,769 --> 00:24:18,874
For you, it might just be startup money.

299
00:24:18,874 --> 00:24:25,600
But for me, starting with 30 million,
it's impossible.

300
00:24:29,658 --> 00:24:31,720
Want me to help?

301
00:24:32,820 --> 00:24:36,346
If you're selling land, I'll buy it.

302
00:24:36,346 --> 00:24:39,160
I'll offer the best price.

303
00:24:40,060 --> 00:24:46,706
But if you don't want to sell
and just want 30 million to start something,

304
00:24:46,706 --> 00:24:48,453
we can talk.

305
00:24:52,129 --> 00:24:54,141
Why would you help me?

306
00:24:55,673 --> 00:24:57,732
I'm not helping.

307
00:24:57,732 --> 00:24:59,920
I'm investing.

I get.

Hey, what's up? I was in the shower. Sorry.

00:32:06,714 --> 00:32:10,090
The lot size is still borderline.

351
00:32:10,090 --> 00:32:17,248
You do know the legal minimum
for spa hotel zoning, right?

352
00:32:17,248 --> 00:32:18,656
Yes, I do.

353
00:32:19,506 --> 00:32:22,967
Yesterday, I visited Jay's home.

354
00:32:22,967 --> 00:32:24,276
Oh, really?

355
00:32:24,276 --> 00:32:27,534
His land is beautiful, Pitcha.

356
00:32:27,534 --> 00:32:32,024
I want it.
But I'll have to really work to get Jay on board.

357
00:32:32,024 --> 00:32:36,736
His land, it makes him even more interesting.

358
00:32:37,674 --> 00:32:39,729
I see.

359
00:32:39,729 --> 00:32:43,249
Okay then, I'll stop here.

360
00:32:43,249 --> 00:32:47,808
You go dig up the info I want, and we'll update.

361
00:33:08,548 --> 00:33:10,470
Yes, boss.

362
00:33:10,470 --> 00:33:13,400
I think I'll stay three more days.

363
00:33:13,400 --> 00:33:15,858
At first it was just for fun,

364
00:33:15,858 --> 00:33:18,916
but yesterday I stumbled upon
a very interesting piece of land.

365
00:33:18,916 --> 00:33:20,873
Yours?

366
00:33:20,873 --> 00:33:23,839
- Nope. Belongs to the hottest host boy in town.
- What?

367
00:33:23,839 --> 00:33:28,301
He owns land like that? Not ordinary at all, huh?

368
00:33:28,301 --> 00:33:33,400
Yeah. But he doesn't even realize what he has.

369
00:33:33,400 --> 00:33:36,840
He still thinks it's small, and wants to come back
and start some little business at home.

370
00:33:36,840 --> 00:33:38,593
What a totally unclear plan.

371
00:33:38,593 --> 00:33:40,800
So what are you going to do, boss?

372
00:33:40,800 --> 00:33:43,760
We need to approach this one just right.

373
00:33:43,760 --> 00:33:47,151
If we get in the right way,
everything else will be easy.

374
00:33:47,151 --> 00:33:49,790
I'm working on how to persuade him.

375
00:33:49,790 --> 00:33:55,240
You can definitely do it, boss.
In the meantime, anything you want me to prep?

376
00:33:56,823 --> 00:33:58,687
Look into Pitcha for me.

377
00:33:58,687 --> 00:34:00,529
Got it.

378
00:34:00,529 --> 00:34:02,839
What do you want to know?

379
00:34:02,839 --> 00:34:05,138
Everything personal.

380
00:34:05,138 --> 00:34:06,776
Has she ever dated anyone?

381
00:34:06,776 --> 00:34:08,628
Is she in a relationship now?

382
00:34:08,628 --> 00:34:10,374
And most importantly,

383
00:34:10,374 --> 00:34:15,500
I want to know if she and Jay
had known each other before.

384
00:34:15,500 --> 00:34:16,917
That's top priority.

385
00:34:16,917 --> 00:34:18,993
Got it. On it.

386
00:34:23,927 --> 00:34:26,429
We had to rent an extra car
because Anita's staying longer.

387
00:34:26,429 --> 00:34:29,040
And I have to take Plearn
for her pre-wedding shoot

388
00:34:29,040 --> 00:34:30,948
and then rush back to Nan.

389
00:34:30,948 --> 00:34:33,106
Why? That's exhausting.

390
00:34:33,106 --> 00:34:34,600
You wait here.

391
00:34:34,600 --> 00:34:38,296
I can't. I have to go,
and I have to hurry back fast.

392
00:34:38,296 --> 00:34:41,719
Because Anita came across a land plot
I've been eyeing for years.

393
00:34:41,719 --> 00:34:44,351
And she's sharp as hell.

394
00:34:44,351 --> 00:34:49,017
If she manages to close that deal directly
without going through me,

395
00:34:49,017 --> 00:34:50,280
I'm totally screwed.

396
00:34:50,280 --> 00:34:52,733
Screwed like, loudly screwed.

397
00:34:52,733 --> 00:34:54,236
Whose land is it?

398
00:34:54,236 --> 00:34:57,816
- The hottest host boy.
- Wait, he owns land?

399
00:34:57,816 --> 00:35:00,960
Yeah, so I'm trying to find a way
to tell him first.

400
00:35:00,960 --> 00:35:03,151
Not to agree to anything Anita says just yet.

401
00:35:03,151 --> 00:35:07,943
If he's going to sell, he should sell to me.
I'm willing to cut him a higher commission.

402
00:35:07,943 --> 00:35:12,141
Why would he agree to that?
If he sells directly, he gets the full amount.

403
00:35:12,141 --> 00:35:14,653
Why would he go through you? No way.

404
00:35:14,653 --> 00:35:16,661
- Exactly.
- Yeah.

405
00:35:16,661 --> 00:35:20,000
But I still think I have a shot.

406
00:35:20,000 --> 00:35:21,686
How?

407
00:35:21,686 --> 00:35:26,317
I think... he likes me.

408
00:35:26,317 --> 00:35:28,822
Pitcha.

409
00:35:28,822 --> 00:35:31,506
- What?
- Wake up!

410
00:35:31,506 --> 00:35:33,118
He's a host.

411
00:35:33,118 --> 00:35:36,658
He meets at least 300 women a year.

412
00:35:36,658 --> 00:35:39,679
Beautiful, generous spenders.

413
00:35:39,679 --> 00:35:42,263
Why do you think he likes you?

414
00:35:42,263 --> 00:35:45,280
You doubled his daily rate.

415
00:35:45,280 --> 00:35:49,481
Of course he's going to act sweet with you.
It's part of the gig, not feelings.

416
00:35:49,481 --> 00:35:54,199
And people in this business? They do it for money.

417
00:35:54,199 --> 00:35:56,664
Not for friendship.

418
00:35:56,664 --> 00:35:59,934
Stop fantasizing like you're one of his clients.

419
00:35:59,934 --> 00:36:03,613
Alright, fine, fine. So maybe he doesn't like me.

420
00:36:03,613 --> 00:36:06,440
But that land, I must get it.

421
00:36:07,162 --> 00:36:09,793
Whatever. Your call.

422
00:36:28,292 --> 00:36:29,990
So cute.

423
00:36:31,001 --> 00:36:32,468
You two really suit each other.

424
00:36:32,468 --> 00:36:37,819
I picked this location
because I wanted to feel relaxed.

425
00:36:37,819 --> 00:36:40,498
And not overly formal.

426
00:36:40,498 --> 00:36:43,886
But the atmosphere is really nice.
It's beautiful. Great choice.

427
00:36:43,886 --> 00:36:47,614
As for the wedding,
I'll send out the invitations later.

428
00:36:47,614 --> 00:36:49,874
I'm still checking out a few more venues.

429
00:36:49,874 --> 00:36:54,524
Oh, then send me one too!
I'd love to do a feature.

430
00:36:54,524 --> 00:37:01,378
I heard a rumor
this might be the biggest wedding of the year.

431
00:37:01,378 --> 00:37:03,961
- Is that true?
- Is that true?

432
00:37:05,120 --> 00:37:06,402
Laks, what do you say?

433
00:37:06,402 --> 00:37:07,931
That's up to the bride.

434
00:37:07,931 --> 00:37:10,993
Honestly, my life from now on, it's all up to her.

435
00:37:10,993 --> 00:37:15,364
- Aw, how sweet. A true spender.
- Adorable.

436
00:37:15,364 --> 00:37:20,696
Let's take a couple photo,
come stand closer together.

437
00:37:20,696 --> 00:37:22,539
One, two, three...

438
00:37:22,539 --> 00:37:25,800
- So lovely.
- Groom, give her a kiss on the cheek.

439
00:37:25,800 --> 00:37:29,460
Aw, too cute.

440
00:37:29,460 --> 00:37:31,827
- Now, the bride's turn. Kiss the groom.
- Beautiful.

441
00:37:31,827 --> 00:37:34,300
- The future bride and groom.
- I'm blushing.

442
00:37:34,300 --> 00:37:36,560
Oh my.

443
00:37:41,840 --> 00:37:44,000
Are you Pitcha?

444
00:37:45,720 --> 00:37:49,433
Prang here. I'm the studio coordinator.

445
00:37:49,433 --> 00:37:55,373
I just wanted to ask about the big tree outside,
can we shoot over there?

446
00:37:55,373 --> 00:37:59,500
It's so hot, Cha. Really hot.

447
00:37:59,500 --> 00:38:02,533
- I need some water.
- Sure.

448
00:38:02,533 --> 00:38:04,800
Almost done.

449
00:38:10,373 --> 00:38:13,147
See, chill.

450
00:38:18,277 --> 00:38:20,580
- Here you go, Plearn.
- Thank you.

451
00:38:20,580 --> 00:38:22,473
- Excuse me.
- Yes?

452
00:38:22,473 --> 00:38:25,980
Do we still need to shoot anywhere else?

453
00:38:25,980 --> 00:38:29,040
Yes, that big tree out front.

454
00:38:29,040 --> 00:38:33,816
What? More shots? No way, it's too hot.

455
00:38:33,816 --> 00:38:37,720
The photographer suggested it.
Thought it might look nice.

456
00:38:37,720 --> 00:38:40,360
But we're skipping that now?

457
00:38:41,160 --> 00:38:46,320
Yes, please tell the photographer,
no need for extra ideas.

458
00:38:46,320 --> 00:38:47,493
Will do.

459
00:38:47,493 --> 00:38:51,300
Now, Plearn, let's get you into your final outfit.
One more set and we're done.

460
00:38:51,300 --> 00:38:53,240
Come on, I'll help.

461
00:38:53,240 --> 00:38:55,100
- Just one more, okay?
- Sure.

462
00:38:55,100 --> 00:38:57,160
For beautiful photos, let's go.

463
00:38:57,160 --> 00:38:58,480
Just a little bit more.

464
00:38:58,480 --> 00:39:00,160
Okay.

465
00:39:02,460 --> 00:39:04,400
Let's take a break.

466
00:39:06,133 --> 00:39:08,980
Cha, are you working during the shoot?

467
00:39:08,980 --> 00:39:15,680
Oh yeah, I need to look into some extra details
about the Sukhothai land.

468
00:39:16,593 --> 00:39:18,160
What kind of details?

469
00:39:18,160 --> 00:39:22,206
I have a friend there. Maybe they can help.

470
00:39:22,206 --> 00:39:23,801
It's okay.

471
00:39:23,801 --> 00:39:27,347
If it's about the Sukhothai plot,
my friend's super well connected.

472
00:39:27,347 --> 00:39:29,107
Wanna ask?

473
00:39:31,420 --> 00:39:34,080
Well, here.

474
00:39:34,080 --> 00:39:37,567
It's this plot, my client's interested.

475
00:39:37,567 --> 00:39:40,287
They want to build a wellness center.

476
00:39:40,287 --> 00:39:45,760
They also want to know
what's planned for the surrounding land.

477
00:39:47,827 --> 00:39:51,213
Laks, time to change outfits.

478
00:39:51,213 --> 00:39:53,222
Okay.

479
00:39:53,222 --> 00:39:55,060
I'll ask my friend.

480
00:39:55,060 --> 00:39:57,353
Send me the details too.

481
00:40:17,393 --> 00:40:18,887
Finally done, huh?

482
00:40:18,887 --> 00:40:22,233
Yeah, and early too. Nice.

483
00:40:22,233 --> 00:40:28,680
Our team really gave it their all.
Feel free to call on us anytime.

484
00:40:28,680 --> 00:40:32,213
That coordinator girl is really impressive.

485
00:40:32,213 --> 00:40:36,713
Oh, she's a regular freelancer with our office.
She does everything.

486
00:40:36,713 --> 00:40:40,460
Pretty model, extra, assistant, she's amazing.

487
00:40:40,460 --> 00:40:43,360
And get this,
she's saving up to buy a condo in Thonglor.

488
00:40:43,360 --> 00:40:46,067
Right by the main road.

489
00:40:46,700 --> 00:40:49,767
She dreams like a mermaid wanting legs.

490
00:40:49,767 --> 00:40:54,000
Well, dream big, go far.

491
00:40:54,000 --> 00:40:56,440
Far out of reach, maybe.

492
00:40:58,360 --> 00:41:03,247
A Thonglor condo by the main road?
Even I'd have to think twice.

493
00:41:16,893 --> 00:41:20,640
Yes, yes, I'm on it.

494
00:41:20,640 --> 00:41:23,313
Yeah, the surrounding plots I sent you.

495
00:41:23,313 --> 00:41:27,200
Got it. Thanks so much. Okay.

496
00:41:28,310 --> 00:41:30,387
What are you working on?

497
00:41:30,387 --> 00:41:32,760
I'm checking the land around the plot
Pitcha's planning to sell.

498
00:41:32,760 --> 00:41:35,147
The client wants to know.

499
00:41:35,147 --> 00:41:36,893
Why though?

500
00:41:36,893 --> 00:41:39,720
Come on, Plearn,
when you're about to buy something,

501
00:41:39,720 --> 00:41:41,533
you need to know
what the future surroundings will be like.

502
00:41:41,533 --> 00:41:44,200
What if one day it turns
into a fish sauce factory,

503
00:41:44,200 --> 00:41:46,720
or a car repair shop, or a parking lot?

504
00:41:46,720 --> 00:41:48,800
That wouldn't work, right?

505
00:41:50,113 --> 00:41:53,080
Might as well be a fermented fish factory.

506
00:41:53,080 --> 00:41:55,327
Hey, why are you like this?

507
00:41:55,327 --> 00:41:57,480
If Pitcha manages to sell the land,

508
00:41:57,480 --> 00:41:59,413
she definitely won't come back
to help with my work.

509
00:41:59,413 --> 00:42:02,240
Hey, come on, Plearn, that's your sister.

510
00:42:02,240 --> 00:42:04,987
And she seems to be doing well
with her new career.

511
00:42:04,987 --> 00:42:07,540
Plus, I heard she's rushing back to Nan.

512
00:42:07,540 --> 00:42:10,187
She's really serious about this.

513
00:42:10,187 --> 00:42:13,960
Pitcha never sees things realistically.

514
00:42:14,633 --> 00:42:19,400
She wants to sell organic land,
land that doesn't harm the ecosystem.

515
00:42:20,073 --> 00:42:23,293
Even just hearing the headline is confusing.

516
00:42:23,293 --> 00:42:27,513
These days, no one in the land business
cares about ecosystems.

517
00:42:27,513 --> 00:42:33,520
Even if she's lucky to close one or two deals,
that'll only buy her a year.

518
00:42:34,607 --> 00:42:36,880
Honestly, I wish she wouldn't drag me into this.

519
00:42:46,813 --> 00:42:50,893
Hello, Miss Pitcha.
Weren't you supposed to arrive tomorrow?

520
00:42:50,893 --> 00:42:51,880
Yes, I was.

521
00:42:51,880 --> 00:42:55,680
But I finished my errands early,
so I'll need to book one more night.

522
00:42:55,680 --> 00:42:58,633
- Do you have a room available?
- One moment please.

523
00:43:01,160 --> 00:43:05,060
Your room is scheduled for tomorrow.
Tonight we already have a guest.

524
00:43:06,360 --> 00:43:10,200
Looks like there's a room available
in the same zone as your two friends.

525
00:43:11,053 --> 00:43:14,953
It's a connecting room,
right next to the gentleman.

526
00:43:14,953 --> 00:43:16,640
Great. I'll take it.

527
00:43:16,640 --> 00:43:18,600
Please wait a moment.

528
00:43:23,999 --> 00:43:28,427
Also, please don't tell my friends I'm here yet.
I just want to rest. I'm really tired.

529
00:43:28,427 --> 00:43:31,207
- Of course.
- Thank you.

530
00:44:20,720 --> 00:44:22,507
Hello?

531
00:44:22,507 --> 00:44:24,880
Hello, how's everything going?

532
00:44:24,880 --> 00:44:27,987
So... where did Miss Anita and Jay go?

533
00:44:27,987 --> 00:44:34,493
They went to a temple, and to see some land.
Two days in a row, actually.

534
00:44:35,535 --> 00:44:37,960
Where exactly? Which places?

535
00:44:37,960 --> 00:44:43,267
A bit out of town.
A small eatery called Yai Jan's Place.

536
00:44:44,361 --> 00:44:49,280
And where are they now?
Have they returned to the hotel yet?

537
00:44:49,280 --> 00:44:54,320
They're drinking at a bar in town.
Should be back soon.

538
00:44:55,420 --> 00:44:57,920
Okay. Thank you.

539
00:45:10,333 --> 00:45:13,187
Whoa... are you okay?

540
00:45:13,187 --> 00:45:15,347
I'm fine.

541
00:45:15,347 --> 00:45:17,640
Really.

542
00:45:19,433 --> 00:45:21,227
But you should sleep early tonight.

543
00:45:21,227 --> 00:45:22,793
Tomorrow we travel in the evening.

544
00:45:22,793 --> 00:45:25,900
And you've got a meeting in the morning, right?

545
00:45:28,547 --> 00:45:32,720
I've never been away from home this long.

546
00:45:33,740 --> 00:45:35,786
Same here.

547
00:45:38,289 --> 00:45:41,189
No one can match your appearance fee.

548
00:45:44,080 --> 00:45:47,060
Even if they offered more,
sometimes I wouldn't go.

549
00:45:49,920 --> 00:45:54,773
Did you take this job because of me?
Or because of Pitcha?

550
00:46:12,700 --> 00:46:16,773
Sleep early tonight, okay? I'll call to wake you.

551
00:46:16,773 --> 00:46:19,000
The meeting's at 10, right?

552
00:46:21,413 --> 00:46:23,420
Good night.

553
00:47:06,340 --> 00:47:08,393
Room service, hello. May I help you?

554
00:47:08,393 --> 00:47:10,230
I'd like to order food.

555
00:47:10,230 --> 00:47:15,360
One bowl of seafood porridge, and some hot tea.
Make it chamomile.

556
00:47:15,360 --> 00:47:17,020
Certainly. Please hold for a moment.

557
00:47:17,020 --> 00:47:18,947
Thank you.

558
00:47:33,473 --> 00:47:35,080
Hey.

559
00:47:38,347 --> 00:47:39,920
Hey.

560
00:47:48,153 --> 00:47:51,408
Oh, what are you doing here?

561
00:47:51,408 --> 00:47:54,560
I finished earlier than expected,
so I came back right away.

562
00:47:55,457 --> 00:47:56,893
Really?

563
00:47:56,893 --> 00:48:02,093
Of course. We made a promise, didn't we?
I keep my promises.

564
00:48:03,693 --> 00:48:07,373
Are you hungry? I ordered porridge. Join me.

565
00:48:07,373 --> 00:48:08,880
Sure.

566
00:48:14,427 --> 00:48:16,527
You haven't eaten?

567
00:48:16,527 --> 00:48:21,187
Not at all. Anita's more into drinking.
Her tolerance is insane.

568
00:48:23,979 --> 00:48:27,827
Hey, did you take her to
see the land at your house?

569
00:48:27,827 --> 00:48:29,147
Yeah.

570
00:48:30,887 --> 00:48:34,700
There, so that is why you came back, isn't it?

571
00:48:38,107 --> 00:48:42,400
Are you going to sell the land to Anita?

572
00:48:45,227 --> 00:48:49,653
I've looked at that land many times.
It's really beautiful.

573
00:48:49,653 --> 00:48:53,160
If you're going to sell it, sell it to me.

574
00:48:53,160 --> 00:48:59,360
I'll include a clause in the contract
requiring the buyer to protect the environment.

575
00:49:02,833 --> 00:49:06,613
Are you even listening to me?

576
00:49:09,491 --> 00:49:11,478
Hello?

577
00:49:16,660 --> 00:49:18,540
The land must be really beautiful, huh?

578
00:49:18,540 --> 00:49:22,060
So beautiful
that both you and Anita want it this badly.

579
00:49:32,125 --> 00:49:34,278
Sounds like the food's here.
