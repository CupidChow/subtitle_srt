1
00:01:04,593 --> 00:01:07,414
I want the land in Nan.

2
00:01:10,720 --> 00:01:13,554
The one you already know the location of.

3
00:01:15,780 --> 00:01:23,351
If you can get it for us with full rights,
you'll get a 20% commission.

4
00:01:24,513 --> 00:01:27,493
I'll invest billions,

5
00:01:27,493 --> 00:01:33,156
and you'll gain both credibility and
lifetime dividends from the project.

6
00:01:35,080 --> 00:01:38,859
You're pressuring me
to hand over Jira's land to you.

7
00:01:39,960 --> 00:01:42,220
The return is massive.

8
00:01:42,220 --> 00:01:46,257
Before you answer, go run the numbers.

9
00:01:50,533 --> 00:01:54,351
You'll have a hundred million
within the first year.

10
00:01:56,080 --> 00:02:00,700
You'll have credibility,
use it to build your reputation.

11
00:02:00,700 --> 00:02:04,687
You'll become the person
you've always wanted to be.

12
00:02:04,687 --> 00:02:10,835
No one will dare touch you,
no matter who you choose to work with.

13
00:02:18,387 --> 00:02:25,359
This is your chance to be that person, Pitcha.

14
00:03:48,333 --> 00:03:50,367
Are you okay?

15
00:03:50,367 --> 00:03:53,360
No. Total waste of time.

16
00:03:53,360 --> 00:03:56,573
I'm so mad I want to curse,
but I'm just too tired.

17
00:03:57,413 --> 00:04:00,460
Which land is it that Ms. Anita wants so badly?

18
00:04:00,460 --> 00:04:04,633
Why do she and Mr. Wasu sound like
they're in total agreement?

19
00:04:04,633 --> 00:04:06,693
Whose land did they visit?

20
00:04:06,693 --> 00:04:08,900
Jira's land.

21
00:04:08,900 --> 00:04:12,187
What? Your boyfriend's?

22
00:04:12,187 --> 00:04:14,887
I was the one who took both of them to see it.

23
00:04:14,887 --> 00:04:19,093
It's not even his to sell,
it belongs to his grandma.

24
00:04:19,093 --> 00:04:24,232
So what now?
You're going to pitch the project to someone else?

25
00:04:25,053 --> 00:04:29,925
You're negotiating the best deal
for both yourself and Jira.

26
00:04:31,167 --> 00:04:35,193
Before we started dating,
I tried to buy it from him a few times.

27
00:04:35,193 --> 00:04:39,620
It didn't go over well,
so I didn't want more conflict.

28
00:04:39,620 --> 00:04:44,412
I thought I'd try again because honestly,
it could really benefit him.

29
00:04:50,800 --> 00:04:57,560
Want some strawberries?
From our farm. Ugly but sweet.

30
00:04:57,560 --> 00:05:00,874
I'm full already, Grandma. Maybe later.

31
00:05:02,333 --> 00:05:04,360
Grandma.

32
00:05:04,360 --> 00:05:09,453
Don't you want to know
what I do for work in Bangkok?

33
00:05:09,453 --> 00:05:14,593
Well, you go there to earn money for me
to see the doctor, right?

34
00:05:14,593 --> 00:05:17,987
Yeah, but aren't you curious
what kind of work it is?

35
00:05:17,987 --> 00:05:23,193
As long as you're not hurting anyone,
it's good work to me.

36
00:05:23,193 --> 00:05:25,603
But Mom said the neighbors are gossiping.

37
00:05:25,603 --> 00:05:28,393
Who cares what they say?

38
00:05:28,393 --> 00:05:32,195
Those gossipers, what are their kids doing
for a living anyway?

39
00:05:32,195 --> 00:05:34,224
Just ignore them.

40
00:05:34,880 --> 00:05:37,980
If you want to sell the land, then sell it.

41
00:05:37,980 --> 00:05:40,300
Your mom's probably exhausted
from taking care of everything.

42
00:05:40,300 --> 00:05:42,513
I feel bad for her.

43
00:05:42,513 --> 00:05:46,893
Sell it, so you can use the money
to start a new life.

44
00:05:46,893 --> 00:05:52,091
Just leave five rai for me, the part I asked for.

45
00:05:58,567 --> 00:06:04,185
Tear down this house and build me a new one.

46
00:06:05,180 --> 00:06:06,993
Grandma.

47
00:06:07,987 --> 00:06:09,220
Are you serious?

48
00:06:09,220 --> 00:06:11,388
My grandkids are struggling.

49
00:06:11,388 --> 00:06:14,200
Why wait for me to die?

50
00:06:14,200 --> 00:06:18,571
If I can give something, I will.

51
00:06:36,580 --> 00:06:38,196
What?

52
00:06:45,307 --> 00:06:46,940
Hello?

53
00:06:46,940 --> 00:06:49,847
<i>I've transferred the final payment.
Check your account.</i>

54
00:06:49,847 --> 00:06:51,915
One sec.

55
00:06:53,220 --> 00:06:56,173
[80,000 baht received]

56
00:06:57,053 --> 00:06:58,853
Got it!

57
00:06:58,853 --> 00:07:00,153
Thank you so much.

58
00:07:00,153 --> 00:07:04,440
<i>Are you free in June?
I've got an eight-episode series. Want to try?</i>

59
00:07:04,440 --> 00:07:07,733
Yes, I'm free. I'd love to.

60
00:07:07,733 --> 00:07:10,127
Send me the references so I can start prepping.

61
00:07:10,127 --> 00:07:12,009
Thank you so much.

62
00:07:12,860 --> 00:07:16,140
Ever since you've been with Maprang,
you've been going home early.

63
00:07:16,140 --> 00:07:18,320
- And Gur's here too. So cute.
- What? Got a problem with me?

64
00:07:18,320 --> 00:07:19,200
You ditched me.

65
00:07:19,200 --> 00:07:21,060
- Gur.
- You're talking too much.

66
00:07:21,060 --> 00:07:23,067
Come here.

67
00:07:23,067 --> 00:07:24,893
- Ter!
- Yeah?

68
00:07:24,893 --> 00:07:27,095
They're calling you. Go.

69
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:30,513
I'm here.

70
00:07:30,513 --> 00:07:34,200
It's Gur, not you. We're calling for Gur.

71
00:07:34,200 --> 00:07:38,547
Go get Gur for me.
I want to invite him to hang out after.

72
00:07:38,547 --> 00:07:40,287
- You mean Gur?
- Yes.

73
00:07:40,287 --> 00:07:42,440
Okay, give me a second. I'll negotiate.

74
00:07:42,440 --> 00:07:44,640
- Alright, help me out.
- Okay, so sweet.

75
00:07:44,640 --> 00:07:47,040
- So, now what?
- Gur.

76
00:07:47,040 --> 00:07:48,727
They called you, not me.

77
00:07:48,727 --> 00:07:52,367
- Oh really?
- They invited you to hang out. Want to go?

78
00:07:52,367 --> 00:07:57,204
Gur, but those two customers are big spenders.

79
00:07:58,133 --> 00:08:00,060
So what now?

80
00:08:00,060 --> 00:08:04,267
I'm tired. I just want to go home and sleep.
You guys go.

81
00:08:04,267 --> 00:08:07,098
Okay. Then you go tell them yourself.

82
00:08:07,787 --> 00:08:10,160
They already negotiated.

83
00:08:10,160 --> 00:08:12,827
Gur.

84
00:08:12,827 --> 00:08:15,700
Want to grab rad na at my place after work?

85
00:08:15,700 --> 00:08:18,233
I'll double the portion.

86
00:08:18,233 --> 00:08:20,720
What are you even saying?

87
00:08:20,720 --> 00:08:23,687
I'm heading out now.
The others will take care of you.

88
00:08:23,687 --> 00:08:26,420
Huh? What a shame.

89
00:08:26,420 --> 00:08:28,173
It's alright. No need to feel bad.

90
00:08:28,173 --> 00:08:30,433
I'm Bew and I will take care of you,
and there's Ter too.

91
00:08:30,433 --> 00:08:33,633
- Oh, Bew.
- I will take care of you.

92
00:08:38,076 --> 00:08:39,120
Hello?

93
00:08:39,120 --> 00:08:41,370
<i>Hello? Have you eaten yet?</i>

94
00:08:41,370 --> 00:08:43,567
Are you hungry? I'll bring you something.

95
00:08:43,567 --> 00:08:46,733
I'm hungry. I was just about to fry an egg.

96
00:08:46,733 --> 00:08:50,327
Don't fry it yet. I'll get you something.
What do you feel like eating?

97
00:08:52,300 --> 00:08:54,116
Som tum with green mango.

98
00:08:54,116 --> 00:08:56,593
<i>Extra fermented fish sauce.</i>

99
00:08:56,593 --> 00:08:58,229
Som tum with mango?

100
00:08:59,193 --> 00:09:02,380
It's so late. Where am I even going to find that?

101
00:09:02,380 --> 00:09:05,771
Hey, they're still selling it by the bus stop.

102
00:09:06,467 --> 00:09:08,093
Okay, I'll go get it for you.

103
00:09:08,093 --> 00:09:10,516
Hang on, don't fry that egg yet.

104
00:09:11,627 --> 00:09:14,767
Here it comes.

105
00:09:14,767 --> 00:09:19,733
Wow, almost 2 AM, and someone still
ordered extra-fermented fish sauce mango salad.

106
00:09:22,540 --> 00:09:24,504
- Hey!
- Huh?

107
00:09:26,980 --> 00:09:28,782
What are you wearing?

108
00:09:29,540 --> 00:09:34,827
There's a wedding scene tomorrow.
They've got everything, bride and groom outfits.

109
00:09:34,827 --> 00:09:37,413
I was about to pack them,
but figured I'd try them on first.

110
00:09:37,413 --> 00:09:38,868
Pretty, right?

111
00:09:39,633 --> 00:09:44,478
Never thought I'd get to wear something like this.

112
00:09:47,707 --> 00:09:50,813
Should I wear my hair down or up?

113
00:09:50,813 --> 00:09:56,693
Like this? Or maybe half-up?

114
00:09:56,693 --> 00:09:59,106
Do you have a groom outfit I can borrow?

115
00:10:00,100 --> 00:10:02,044
I want to try it on too.

116
00:10:04,926 --> 00:10:05,860
It won't fit you.

117
00:10:05,860 --> 00:10:10,107
Your arms and legs are too long,
and you're huge like a buffalo.

118
00:10:10,107 --> 00:10:15,770
Oh, come on, just let me try it.
I just want to wear it with you.

119
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:24,893
Alright, fine. I'll look for one.

120
00:10:24,893 --> 00:10:26,758
Might have something.

121
00:10:38,700 --> 00:10:41,060
Scoot over.

122
00:10:45,720 --> 00:10:47,622
Hold on.

123
00:10:57,940 --> 00:10:59,660
How do I look?

124
00:10:59,660 --> 00:11:01,271
Cute, right?

125
00:11:02,093 --> 00:11:06,067
Hey, how much are outfits like these?

126
00:11:06,067 --> 00:11:07,580
There are all kinds.

127
00:11:07,580 --> 00:11:09,940
Tens of thousands, hundreds of thousands,
even millions.

128
00:11:09,940 --> 00:11:11,628
Why?

129
00:11:15,146 --> 00:11:18,067
Because I'm going to save up and buy one for you.

130
00:11:18,067 --> 00:11:20,469
But just the ten-thousand-range.
Would that be okay?

131
00:11:23,295 --> 00:11:24,880
Why would you buy it for me?

132
00:11:24,880 --> 00:11:28,234
This kind of thing, no one just buys it as a joke.
It's considered symbolic.

133
00:11:28,234 --> 00:11:30,420
I'm not joking. I'm serious.

134
00:11:30,420 --> 00:11:33,144
I'll buy it, you'll wear it,
and then we'll get married.

135
00:11:36,847 --> 00:11:41,313
No need to buy, there are tons to rent.

136
00:11:41,313 --> 00:11:43,941
Save the money for something else.

137
00:11:45,746 --> 00:11:49,238
What about a ring?

138
00:11:51,244 --> 00:11:53,275
A ring?

139
00:11:55,520 --> 00:11:59,413
I want one, yeah. Doesn't have to be big.

140
00:11:59,413 --> 00:12:02,094
Whatever you can afford is fine.

141
00:12:03,100 --> 00:12:04,649
Okay.

142
00:12:16,460 --> 00:12:22,761
The only thing I've got...
is my dad's monk ring.

143
00:12:26,940 --> 00:12:28,894
Wear this for now.

144
00:12:32,427 --> 00:12:34,254
Your hand.

145
00:12:59,333 --> 00:13:01,520
I'm claiming you, okay?

146
00:13:02,713 --> 00:13:08,004
And if the new ring comes,
I'll get you a new one.

147
00:13:21,973 --> 00:13:24,637
Careful, or the pants will rip.

148
00:13:32,547 --> 00:13:34,520
I'll wait for it.

149
00:13:53,433 --> 00:13:55,460
What did Pitcha say?

150
00:13:55,460 --> 00:13:57,565
She's mad at me.

151
00:14:00,720 --> 00:14:06,507
That's just how she is, idealist, principled.

152
00:14:06,507 --> 00:14:11,836
But I get why she doesn't want
to get involved with the Nan land.

153
00:14:12,953 --> 00:14:15,094
She and Jay...

154
00:14:16,340 --> 00:14:22,267
I mean Jira, the landowner.
I think they're together.

155
00:14:22,267 --> 00:14:24,761
I've seen them together.

156
00:14:25,620 --> 00:14:29,527
I have too. Annoying, honestly.

157
00:14:29,527 --> 00:14:33,339
Their chemistry is just disgusting.

158
00:14:35,713 --> 00:14:42,973
If you think Nan is the better investment,
then pressure Pitcha.

159
00:14:42,973 --> 00:14:46,120
She's sensitive to high returns.

160
00:14:46,120 --> 00:14:50,014
If the payout is big enough, she'll go for it.

161
00:14:50,627 --> 00:14:54,267
- Why are you so sure?
- Because she's done it before.

162
00:14:54,267 --> 00:14:59,212
She once offered Jay
in exchange for me viewing a property.

163
00:14:59,973 --> 00:15:01,947
What?

164
00:15:03,593 --> 00:15:07,900
Jay was a very popular bar host at the time.

165
00:15:08,620 --> 00:15:15,368
Pitcha paid a fortune to impress me,
and that's how she became my agent in Thailand.

166
00:15:17,247 --> 00:15:23,340
Pitcha's not greedy for money.
She's greedy for success.

167
00:15:23,340 --> 00:15:30,158
Tempt her enough, and she'll make it happen.
Trust me.

168
00:15:36,273 --> 00:15:38,853
<i>How are you?</i>

169
00:15:38,853 --> 00:15:41,413
Pretty good.

170
00:15:41,413 --> 00:15:44,507
Grandma and Mom didn't fight too badly.

171
00:15:44,507 --> 00:15:47,293
How about you? Did your presentation go well?

172
00:15:47,293 --> 00:15:48,846
Not really.

173
00:15:49,580 --> 00:15:52,133
Ann snuck in with Wasu behind the scenes

174
00:15:52,133 --> 00:15:57,087
and secretly listened to me pitch the project
as the lead advisor.

175
00:15:57,087 --> 00:15:59,620
- What?
- <i>Yeah.</i>

176
00:15:59,620 --> 00:16:02,667
I was totally shocked. Furious.

177
00:16:02,667 --> 00:16:05,060
Don't tell me this is because of me.

178
00:16:05,060 --> 00:16:09,920
It is. It's about your land too.

179
00:16:09,920 --> 00:16:15,693
<i>They said if it's your land,
they're ready to invest even more than I proposed.</i>

180
00:16:15,693 --> 00:16:18,846
The land, the surroundings, everything is ideal.

181
00:16:18,846 --> 00:16:21,807
It's valued at hundreds of millions.

182
00:16:21,807 --> 00:16:24,893
<i>When are you coming back?</i>

183
00:16:24,893 --> 00:16:27,949
I really want to talk to you about this seriously.

184
00:16:27,949 --> 00:16:31,174
Or I could come to Nan if that's easier.

185
00:16:32,913 --> 00:16:36,613
Actually, could you come here?

186
00:16:36,613 --> 00:16:40,080
I want my mom and grandma to hear this too.

187
00:16:40,080 --> 00:16:43,705
I think they should be part of the decision.

188
00:16:44,963 --> 00:16:47,893
Sure. I'll head over.

189
00:16:47,893 --> 00:16:51,300
I'll let you know once I get a flight.

190
00:16:51,300 --> 00:16:54,740
Okay. Love you.

191
00:16:54,740 --> 00:16:57,185
Love you too. Bye.

192
00:17:05,940 --> 00:17:08,232
[Mr. Wasu]

193
00:17:12,273 --> 00:17:17,143
- Yes?
- <i>Okay to talk? Can we meet?</i>

194
00:17:21,073 --> 00:17:22,729
Please, have a seat.

195
00:17:23,840 --> 00:17:28,213
I'm sorry about yesterday.
I was terrible for not telling you beforehand.

196
00:17:28,213 --> 00:17:32,940
Exactly. It made you instantly untrustworthy.

197
00:17:32,940 --> 00:17:38,667
I'll be direct.
I contacted you because you're Anita's only agent.

198
00:17:38,667 --> 00:17:41,480
I hoped we'd work together eventually.

199
00:17:41,480 --> 00:17:46,613
When she reached out,
I assumed you were already collaborating.

200
00:17:46,613 --> 00:17:50,220
The land in this project
is land Anita has never seen before,

201
00:17:50,220 --> 00:17:54,341
because the owner made it clear
he won't sell to foreigners.

202
00:17:54,341 --> 00:17:57,500
You know the conditions.

203
00:17:57,500 --> 00:18:01,893
This deal is between my company and yours,
not Anita's.

204
00:18:01,893 --> 00:18:04,378
So what's unclear?

205
00:18:04,378 --> 00:18:09,760
Why I'm here is to clarify what's your decision?

206
00:18:09,760 --> 00:18:14,080
You and me? You and Anita?

207
00:18:14,080 --> 00:18:16,260
Or all three of us?

208
00:18:16,260 --> 00:18:18,795
You and I.

209
00:18:20,140 --> 00:18:25,500
There is no you and I anymore.
Because I want to partner with Anita too.

210
00:18:25,500 --> 00:18:29,027
If you're okay with a three-party deal,
we move forward.

211
00:18:29,027 --> 00:18:32,260
You'll get everything you asked for
in your proposal.

212
00:18:32,260 --> 00:18:37,819
But the numbers might go up a lot
if we get your boyfriend's land.

213
00:18:39,367 --> 00:18:42,280
If we can secure Jira's land, I'm in.

214
00:18:42,280 --> 00:18:47,033
If not, Anita and I might go
find new land ourselves.

215
00:18:47,033 --> 00:18:50,567
The project might resemble yours, yes.

216
00:18:50,567 --> 00:18:54,933
Just so you know. It's a global trend.

217
00:18:57,513 --> 00:19:02,347
Earlier, I was considering
that if your answer was good enough,

218
00:19:02,347 --> 00:19:05,193
I might agree to work with you again.

219
00:19:05,193 --> 00:19:07,567
But after seeing what kind of person
you really are,

220
00:19:07,567 --> 00:19:10,332
I don't think we can work together at all.

221
00:19:13,060 --> 00:19:16,932
Anita told me too that you'd be like this.

222
00:19:18,153 --> 00:19:22,373
And people like this never succeed.

223
00:19:22,373 --> 00:19:27,513
People who think the world has to be beautiful
and everyone has to be kind.

224
00:19:27,513 --> 00:19:30,101
That kind of mindset is weak and naive.

225
00:19:31,607 --> 00:19:34,820
In business, there's no need to love each other.

226
00:19:34,820 --> 00:19:37,987
Just be satisfied
with the benefits you're getting.

227
00:19:37,987 --> 00:19:42,593
If you don't get that, ask your boyfriend.

228
00:19:42,593 --> 00:19:45,080
He sells his body. I'm sure he understands.

229
00:19:50,420 --> 00:19:54,878
What he does has more dignity
than your character ever will.

231
00:20:33,893 --> 00:20:36,683
[Arrival]

232
00:20:46,040 --> 00:20:50,020
Hey. How are you? Tired?

233
00:20:50,020 --> 00:20:52,210
And did you miss me?

234
00:20:52,210 --> 00:20:53,700
Not really.

235
00:20:53,700 --> 00:20:58,491
What? I missed you every single day so much.

236
00:21:01,220 --> 00:21:02,725
Let's go.

237
00:21:10,333 --> 00:21:14,367
Do you think selling the land to Ann
might actually solve everything?

238
00:21:14,367 --> 00:21:17,193
Don't make that decision just for me.

239
00:21:17,193 --> 00:21:19,373
It's not exactly that.

240
00:21:19,373 --> 00:21:24,860
But if she opens a big wellness center here,
people around here will have jobs.

241
00:21:24,860 --> 00:21:28,820
The local crops and herbs
will definitely find buyers.

242
00:21:28,820 --> 00:21:32,873
I'd have money,
you'd have your name on the project.

243
00:21:32,873 --> 00:21:36,230
If we don't see ourselves
as losing to Ann's way of thinking,

244
00:21:36,230 --> 00:21:38,394
it could be a win-win.

245
00:21:41,020 --> 00:21:43,060
That's true.

246
00:21:43,060 --> 00:21:47,107
But it's your decision.

247
00:21:47,107 --> 00:21:51,228
It's your family's land.

248
00:21:58,960 --> 00:22:01,486
Do you think she has other motives?

249
00:22:05,347 --> 00:22:06,919
She...

250
00:22:07,953 --> 00:22:10,580
probably loves you in her own way.

251
00:22:10,580 --> 00:22:13,307
That's why she wants to be involved with you.

252
00:22:13,307 --> 00:22:21,091
And maybe it'd satisfy her ego
if we accepted her offer.

253
00:22:23,480 --> 00:22:32,633
But really...
I think we should all see the world as it is.

254
00:22:32,633 --> 00:22:35,947
This deal benefits everyone.

255
00:22:35,947 --> 00:22:38,701
If you do end up selling...

256
00:22:39,587 --> 00:22:45,313
I hope you do it
because you're trying to help everyone

257
00:22:45,313 --> 00:22:50,092
not because you feel defeated
by Ann's way of thinking.

258
00:22:51,793 --> 00:22:53,420
Yeah.

259
00:22:58,460 --> 00:23:00,840
I'll revise the sale terms...

260
00:23:01,800 --> 00:23:04,100
like you said.

261
00:23:05,240 --> 00:23:10,800
The buyer must commit to long-term
environmental responsibility for the community.

262
00:23:10,800 --> 00:23:14,102
Okay, I'll draft the contract.

263
00:23:14,102 --> 00:23:15,480
Alright.

264
00:23:31,347 --> 00:23:34,220
Both my mom and grandma must be so excited.

265
00:23:34,220 --> 00:23:36,113
I've never brought anyone
to stay at our house before.

266
00:23:36,113 --> 00:23:37,467
Really?

267
00:23:37,467 --> 00:23:42,410
Really. You'll sleep in my room.
I'll sleep in Grandma's.

268
00:23:43,381 --> 00:23:45,018
Let's go.

269
00:23:55,790 --> 00:24:00,831
Well, here it is, Grandma Chan's famous Kaeng Ho.

270
00:24:00,831 --> 00:24:05,329
- Wow.
- Looks delicious. Smells amazing.

271
00:24:05,329 --> 00:24:07,853
Eat lots so you stay strong.

272
00:24:07,853 --> 00:24:10,187
Do I not look strong already?

273
00:24:10,187 --> 00:24:13,793
You could put on a little more weight.
Good if you're planning on having kids.

274
00:24:13,793 --> 00:24:15,540
Grandma!

275
00:24:16,460 --> 00:24:18,940
What? Just saying.

276
00:24:18,940 --> 00:24:23,660
All this talk about buying and selling land,
seems like you two are about to get engaged.

277
00:24:23,660 --> 00:24:27,103
Don't go saying that, Mom. Ask her first.

278
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:34,087
I already told Ji if he wants to sell, then sell.

279
00:24:34,087 --> 00:24:37,680
Use it to build a new life.

280
00:24:37,680 --> 00:24:40,293
Let me talk to the buyer first, Grandma.

281
00:24:40,293 --> 00:24:43,331
We might sell or just lease it out long-term.

282
00:24:43,331 --> 00:24:46,147
Sell or lease, whatever you decide.

283
00:24:46,147 --> 00:24:48,740
Just leave me the remaining five rai.

284
00:24:48,740 --> 00:24:53,480
I don't want to kick out
the people I invited to farm there.

285
00:24:53,480 --> 00:24:56,650
They've been with us for years.

286
00:24:58,431 --> 00:25:00,500
Can we let them stay, son?

287
00:25:00,500 --> 00:25:01,987
Of course, Mom.

288
00:25:01,987 --> 00:25:04,627
They'll have to agree to our terms.

289
00:25:04,627 --> 00:25:07,705
If they agree, then we sell.

290
00:25:18,373 --> 00:25:21,867
Ji, you think Grandma will be lonely?

291
00:25:21,867 --> 00:25:24,406
Come on, Mom. No way.

292
00:25:26,187 --> 00:25:30,860
But if you really plan to sell the land,
does it have to be in the next day or two?

293
00:25:30,860 --> 00:25:34,976
Not necessarily. But it'd be good to talk soon.

294
00:25:55,313 --> 00:25:59,627
I'll call Ann and ask her to come here.

295
00:25:59,627 --> 00:26:04,382
Wasu should come too.
They've already agreed to work together.

[Nan Nakhon Airport]

297
00:26:37,660 --> 00:26:39,638
This is kind of funny, huh?

298
00:26:41,073 --> 00:26:45,087
Do you want to see the land right away
or check into the hotel first?

299
00:26:45,087 --> 00:26:49,713
The way you say that,
it sounds like the sale is definitely happening.

300
00:26:49,713 --> 00:26:52,060
I just want you to see the land one more time.

301
00:26:52,060 --> 00:26:53,973
There are new terms,

302
00:26:53,973 --> 00:26:58,336
and I think if we go over them while we're there,
it'll help you picture things better.

303
00:27:00,520 --> 00:27:03,555
So? Where to first?

304
00:27:05,500 --> 00:27:07,113
Let's go see the land.

305
00:27:07,113 --> 00:27:11,274
Alright, please hop in.
We've rented a car for you.

306
00:27:12,333 --> 00:27:14,360
Sounds familiar, doesn't it?

307
00:27:24,255 --> 00:27:27,422
Just follow the fence line
all the way to the storefront.

308
00:27:33,573 --> 00:27:35,636
And what about that section over there?

309
00:27:36,487 --> 00:27:38,387
That part's not included in the contract.

310
00:27:38,387 --> 00:27:40,800
It's not for sale and not for lease either.

311
00:27:40,800 --> 00:27:45,187
So we don't get the full plot,
and the villagers there will be right next to us.

312
00:27:45,187 --> 00:27:49,967
But your wellness center needs
privacy fencing anyway, right?

313
00:27:49,967 --> 00:27:54,507
Any land purchase
will always border someone else's.

314
00:27:54,507 --> 00:27:57,529
If we can't get it all, we're not interested.

315
00:27:59,980 --> 00:28:04,347
From what I can see, nearly seven rai are missing.

316
00:28:04,347 --> 00:28:06,694
That's not a small issue.

317
00:28:08,027 --> 00:28:15,293
You've wasted our time flying here
just to say only part of the land is for sale.

318
00:28:15,293 --> 00:28:19,200
This plot wasn't part of the original agreement.

319
00:28:19,200 --> 00:28:23,133
Whether to buy or lease,
we'd have to renegotiate anyway.

320
00:28:23,133 --> 00:28:27,960
Exactly. And this is the new deal, I want it all.

321
00:28:27,960 --> 00:28:31,433
You have one night to decide.

322
00:28:31,433 --> 00:28:37,227
If we sign, you must clear the land for me
by the end of this month.

323
00:28:37,227 --> 00:28:40,940
- But that's only 20-something days away.
- Otherwise, there'll be penalties.

324
00:28:40,940 --> 00:28:45,166
But there are dozens of people living there.
Don't you think they need more time?

325
00:28:47,293 --> 00:28:51,413
You'll get a lump sum when you sign.

326
00:28:51,413 --> 00:28:54,287
Use that to deal with them.

327
00:28:54,287 --> 00:29:00,161
Are you really going to let a bunch of fleas
get in the way of hundreds of millions?

328
00:29:02,320 --> 00:29:07,935
If they won't leave nicely,
then hire someone to burn them out.

329
00:29:22,888 --> 00:29:25,240
Do you really mean that?

330
00:29:25,240 --> 00:29:27,540
Mean what?

331
00:29:27,540 --> 00:29:29,552
The part about burning them out.

332
00:29:32,607 --> 00:29:39,227
If we're being realistic, it works.

333
00:29:39,227 --> 00:29:44,220
Sometimes, even after offering compensation,
relocation, and everything else,

334
00:29:44,220 --> 00:29:46,720
they still won't go.

335
00:29:46,720 --> 00:29:51,709
And those who won't leave...

336
00:29:53,307 --> 00:29:58,433
it's not because they're emotionally attached.

337
00:29:58,433 --> 00:30:01,587
It's because they want a better deal.

338
00:30:01,587 --> 00:30:05,618
Burning them out ends things faster.

339
00:30:13,787 --> 00:30:15,134
Hey.

340
00:30:16,681 --> 00:30:18,649
What are you thinking?

341
00:30:25,001 --> 00:30:30,113
Well... Ann's not that kind of person.

342
00:30:30,113 --> 00:30:34,760
Yeah, she's pushing us too far.

343
00:30:34,760 --> 00:30:40,053
It doesn't make sense
about the timing and about forcing us to leave.

344
00:30:45,965 --> 00:30:48,355
And what if I don't sell the land?

345
00:30:49,067 --> 00:30:56,147
What if I mortgage it and get a loan
to do the project myself? What do you think?

346
00:30:56,147 --> 00:30:58,380
It's a simple approach.

347
00:30:58,380 --> 00:31:00,940
Your land is valuable,

348
00:31:00,940 --> 00:31:05,133
so the interest would be lower
than an unsecured loan for sure.

349
00:31:05,133 --> 00:31:07,060
But it's risky.

350
00:31:07,060 --> 00:31:11,140
If something goes wrong
and you can't repay the loan,

351
00:31:11,140 --> 00:31:13,113
you'll lose the land.

352
00:31:13,113 --> 00:31:18,807
Right now, finding a debt-free investment model
would be best.

353
00:31:18,807 --> 00:31:21,348
A debt-free investment?

354
00:31:26,313 --> 00:31:28,934
Yes, an investment without debt.

355
00:31:37,640 --> 00:31:40,254
A non-debt investment.

356
00:31:43,540 --> 00:31:46,348
Debt-free investing.

357
00:31:51,117 --> 00:31:53,512

358

Hey Tiw, interested in doing business together?

376
00:33:34,633 --> 00:33:38,227
- About what you asked before, okay.
- It's all set.

377
00:33:38,227 --> 00:33:41,524
Now's the time to act,
and we're starting for real.

378
00:33:59,913 --> 00:34:01,703
So?

379
00:34:02,453 --> 00:34:05,578
I have an interesting proposal.

380
00:34:06,820 --> 00:34:12,040
I'm raising funds from small investors
to start a business in my hometown.

381
00:34:12,040 --> 00:34:14,187
So you're not selling the land?

382
00:34:14,187 --> 00:34:16,360
No, I'm not selling.

383
00:34:16,360 --> 00:34:19,580
I want to do it my way.

384
00:34:19,580 --> 00:34:22,027
I want everyone to be in it together.

385
00:34:22,027 --> 00:34:28,197
So I thought raising funds from like-minded people
might just make it possible.

386
00:34:31,820 --> 00:34:34,444

are interested too.

No. We're only bringing in capable investors.

Aren't you afraid he'll be hurt?

397

Well, tell him business doesn't need love.
