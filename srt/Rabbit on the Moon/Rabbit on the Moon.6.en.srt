1
00:01:19,493 --> 00:01:21,093
Jay!

2
00:01:21,093 --> 00:01:22,760
Da!

3
00:01:23,587 --> 00:01:25,680
It really is you!

4
00:01:28,307 --> 00:01:31,840
I missed you.

5
00:01:32,520 --> 00:01:36,527
Who are you here with?
Oh, don't tell me you're working.

6
00:01:37,430 --> 00:01:40,680
I begged and begged you
to come have coffee with me,

7
00:01:40,680 --> 00:01:42,687
and you never would.

8
00:01:43,787 --> 00:01:45,760
I made plans with a friend today.

9
00:01:45,760 --> 00:01:47,660
Really?

10
00:01:47,660 --> 00:01:51,053
It's my day off. I've got plans.

11
00:01:51,053 --> 00:01:53,507
Then how about dinner tonight?

12
00:01:53,507 --> 00:01:55,920
I'll make it special.

13
00:01:55,920 --> 00:01:57,933
Sorry, I'm tied up today.

14
00:01:58,764 --> 00:02:01,007
You're never free, are you?

15
00:02:01,007 --> 00:02:04,827
Maybe I'll be free another day.
You could try contacting Tiwa.

16
00:02:04,827 --> 00:02:09,513
Oh, her? She'll say you won't be free all year.

17
00:02:09,513 --> 00:02:10,687
Please?

18
00:02:10,687 --> 00:02:13,127
Please?

19
00:02:15,687 --> 00:02:17,413
Please, okay?

20
00:02:17,413 --> 00:02:20,167
I really can't.

21
00:02:26,800 --> 00:02:29,161
Da, my friend just arrived.
I'll excuse myself now.

22
00:02:29,161 --> 00:02:32,353
Hey, Jay. We're not done talking.

23
00:02:36,095 --> 00:02:37,955
Plew.

24
00:02:40,740 --> 00:02:45,200
That was just an old client.
She just came over to say hi.

25
00:02:45,200 --> 00:02:46,407
Oh.

26
00:02:47,267 --> 00:02:50,780
I was just grabbing something from the car.
You go ahead, I'll be right in.

27
00:02:50,780 --> 00:02:53,233
It's okay, I can wait. We'll go in together.

28
00:02:53,233 --> 00:02:59,653
No, it's fine. You go first.
I just have a quick call to make.

29
00:03:00,267 --> 00:03:03,307
Okay then, just catch up with me inside.

30
00:03:15,287 --> 00:03:17,267
Excuse me.

31
00:03:21,580 --> 00:03:23,087
Yes?

32
00:03:23,087 --> 00:03:25,207
Are you Jay's friend?

33
00:03:26,145 --> 00:03:28,040
Yes, I am.

34
00:03:28,040 --> 00:03:31,813
- That's a relief. I thought...
- Is something wrong?

35
00:03:31,813 --> 00:03:32,960
Oh, no.

36
00:03:32,960 --> 00:03:37,353
It's just I've been trying to reach him for ages,
and I haven't been able to.

37
00:03:37,353 --> 00:03:40,600
I wasn't sure if he changed his number.

38
00:03:41,413 --> 00:03:43,713
Could I get his updated number from you?

39
00:03:44,672 --> 00:03:49,407
I just saw you two talking.
Why didn't you ask him yourself?

40
00:03:49,407 --> 00:03:52,760
Oh, I got caught up in the conversation
and forgot.

41
00:03:53,573 --> 00:03:58,333
Well, he's still inside.
Maybe it's better if you ask him directly?

42
00:03:58,333 --> 00:04:02,147
Wow, are you really his friend?

43
00:04:02,147 --> 00:04:05,380
Yes, I am.
That's exactly why I'm not giving his number.

44
00:04:05,380 --> 00:04:07,433
Because I don't know if he wants to share it.

45
00:04:07,433 --> 00:04:11,240
If you want his updated number,
you'll have to ask him yourself.

46
00:04:11,240 --> 00:04:12,673
Excuse me.

47
00:04:17,393 --> 00:04:19,167
Thanks.

48
00:04:24,787 --> 00:04:26,147
Hey.

49
00:04:32,713 --> 00:04:35,880
So? Hungry?

50
00:04:35,880 --> 00:04:38,480
Want to eat or grab coffee?

51
00:04:39,467 --> 00:04:42,453
Let's go with coffee.

52
00:04:42,453 --> 00:04:43,733
Okay.

53
00:04:49,067 --> 00:04:51,093
Alright, got it.

54
00:04:53,187 --> 00:04:54,993
Plew.

55
00:04:57,147 --> 00:04:58,100
Go ahead and order.

56
00:04:58,100 --> 00:05:01,847
Hey Judy, I saw Jay bring some girl
to the coffee shop.

57
00:05:01,847 --> 00:05:04,113
<i>So? Maybe she's a client?</i>

58
00:05:04,113 --> 00:05:05,900
Doesn't seem like it.

59
00:05:05,900 --> 00:05:09,013
I went over and joked around like,

60
00:05:09,013 --> 00:05:12,187
"Wow, so busy you couldn't even give us
a slot for coffee."

61
00:05:12,187 --> 00:05:14,600
Jay said he was meeting a friend.

62
00:05:14,600 --> 00:05:15,913
A girl?

63
00:05:15,913 --> 00:05:17,367
Yeah.

64
00:05:17,367 --> 00:05:19,693
And she didn't look like a client at all.

65
00:05:19,693 --> 00:05:23,673
That's not okay.
Jay's not allowed to have a girlfriend.

66
00:05:23,673 --> 00:05:27,680
Girl, I'll send you a picture. She's pretty too.

67
00:06:41,767 --> 00:06:46,007
Hey, one of your clients asked me
for your number just now.

68
00:06:46,007 --> 00:06:47,767
Seriously?

69
00:06:48,880 --> 00:06:53,000
She asked if I knew you,
so I said we're friends.

70
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:54,200
Then she asked for your number.

71
00:06:54,200 --> 00:06:58,520
When I didn't give it,
she asked if we're really friends.

72
00:07:02,847 --> 00:07:06,660
I'm sorry about that.

73
00:07:07,667 --> 00:07:11,293
Some of my clients are kinda rude.

74
00:07:11,293 --> 00:07:12,847
Sorry.

75
00:07:13,543 --> 00:07:16,740
Do you usually give clients your number?

76
00:07:16,740 --> 00:07:21,387
Never. I never go off-book with any client.

77
00:07:21,387 --> 00:07:25,867
Anyone who wants to contact me
has to go through Tiwa.

78
00:07:25,867 --> 00:07:30,913
But there's another number I use for VIPs.

79
00:07:31,593 --> 00:07:34,247
Like Anita?

80
00:07:34,247 --> 00:07:35,640
Yeah.

81
00:07:37,113 --> 00:07:39,720
So Anita's special, huh?

82
00:07:40,993 --> 00:07:46,580
You could say that.
Anita's a high-spender, after all.

83
00:07:48,400 --> 00:07:53,353
But the number you have
is my real personal number.

84
00:07:53,353 --> 00:07:56,347
There are only a handful of contacts in there.

85
00:08:10,260 --> 00:08:13,093
Plew, you look a bit tired.

86
00:08:13,093 --> 00:08:18,000
You look hungry. Like you're crashing.

87
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:23,080
Maybe you need some fresh air.

88
00:08:25,440 --> 00:08:27,160
I've got three days off.

89
00:08:27,160 --> 00:08:32,800
If you feel like sitting dumbly by the sea,
or not dumbly, up to you.

90
00:08:34,793 --> 00:08:37,800
Want to go? We can take my car.

91
00:08:37,800 --> 00:08:41,247
Come back whenever you want.

92
00:08:41,247 --> 00:08:43,600
No pressure, I swear.

93
00:08:44,820 --> 00:08:49,307
Alright, let's go somewhere close by then.
I do need fresh air.

94
00:08:49,307 --> 00:08:51,953
Okay. Deal.

95
00:08:58,787 --> 00:09:04,420
Da, if I'm not mistaken,
that girl in the photo is Plearn's younger sister.

96
00:09:04,420 --> 00:09:08,620
- Oh!
- <i>Remember how annoyed we used to get with Plearn?</i>

97
00:09:08,620 --> 00:09:10,040
And now what?

98
00:09:10,040 --> 00:09:13,393
Still going around mocking people
in the alumni group.

99
00:09:13,393 --> 00:09:17,160
Want to post that photo you sent
in the group chat for laughs?

100
00:09:17,160 --> 00:09:18,760
<i>If this gets out of hand,</i>

101
00:09:18,760 --> 00:09:23,529
the one who'll scream the loudest
is probably Teacher Kotchakorn.

102
00:09:23,529 --> 00:09:26,600
If she's just a client, it's one thing.

103
00:09:26,600 --> 00:09:30,480
But if she's his girlfriend,
oh man, her mom and daughter will both freak out.

104
00:09:30,480 --> 00:09:32,937
<i>- Right?</i>
- There's this bar with the cutest owner,

105
00:09:32,937 --> 00:09:34,487
so he's fun to talk to.

106
00:09:37,707 --> 00:09:39,920
Judy, let's pause here.
I'll gossip with you later.

107
00:09:39,920 --> 00:09:41,440
<i>Sure.</i>

108
00:09:53,713 --> 00:09:55,120
Wow.

109
00:10:21,480 --> 00:10:24,507
Two bags, please. One won't be enough.

110
00:10:26,127 --> 00:10:33,307
And some good coffee,
so he can drink it as soon as he wakes up.

111
00:11:10,307 --> 00:11:11,647
Hey.

112
00:11:11,647 --> 00:11:12,867
Water?

113
00:11:12,867 --> 00:11:14,693
It's okay.

114
00:11:20,047 --> 00:11:22,187
Sorry, I didn't dare wake you.

115
00:11:22,187 --> 00:11:25,077
You don't have to rush off, right?

116
00:11:25,077 --> 00:11:28,160
I actually need to head to the bar.

117
00:11:28,160 --> 00:11:31,880
But today's Tuesday. Isn't it your day off?

118
00:11:31,880 --> 00:11:34,847
Boss suddenly called
a last-minute dance rehearsal.

119
00:11:36,080 --> 00:11:37,680
Oh.

120
00:11:39,027 --> 00:11:40,727
Yeah.

121
00:11:40,727 --> 00:11:45,127
I'm heading out too.
Got a lunch meeting with a client.

122
00:11:48,287 --> 00:11:50,047
I'll go shower.

123
00:11:56,313 --> 00:11:57,940
Alright, you should head off.

124
00:12:13,287 --> 00:12:14,760
Hey...

125
00:12:15,827 --> 00:12:19,880
- Next time, let's...
- Just go. See you later.

126
00:12:47,142 --> 00:12:51,560
Your order, Maprang, three bags of rad na.

127
00:12:53,393 --> 00:12:54,953
Huh?

128
00:12:54,953 --> 00:12:56,778
You want me to eat all this?

129
00:12:56,778 --> 00:13:00,473
Three boxes? But...

130
00:13:00,473 --> 00:13:03,273
Hey, hello?

131
00:13:07,327 --> 00:13:09,773
Hello, Miss Maprang?

132
00:13:09,773 --> 00:13:12,218
Your coffee's here.

133
00:13:12,218 --> 00:13:15,393
Oh, you want it left there? Got it.

134
00:14:04,600 --> 00:14:06,917
<i>- Hello?</i>
- Hey, Bew.

135
00:14:06,917 --> 00:14:09,360
Did boss say anything about rehearsal today?

136
00:14:09,360 --> 00:14:11,527
<i>Huh? No.</i>

137
00:14:11,527 --> 00:14:13,020
You sure?

138
00:14:13,020 --> 00:14:14,893
What if they planned it and didn't tell you?

139
00:14:14,893 --> 00:14:20,120
<i>Nope, Gur's the one who arranges those,
and he didn't say anything.</i>

140
00:14:20,120 --> 00:14:22,127
<i>Definitely nothing today.</i>

141
00:14:22,127 --> 00:14:24,041
<i>Why are you asking?</i>

142
00:14:24,041 --> 00:14:29,820
No reason. Just wondering if someone's being fake.

143
00:14:29,820 --> 00:14:31,840
That's all.

144
00:14:37,293 --> 00:14:39,980
Fucking Gur!

145
00:14:39,980 --> 00:14:41,707
Fuck!

146
00:14:44,187 --> 00:14:45,993
Shit!

147
00:14:48,920 --> 00:14:54,280
Hello, Laks? I wanted to ask you about something.

148
00:14:54,280 --> 00:14:58,140
About the land in Sukhothai,
the one I asked you to check on,

149
00:14:58,140 --> 00:15:00,500
what's the update?

150
00:15:00,500 --> 00:15:04,367
<i>Cha, sorry, I totally forgot.</i>

151
00:15:04,367 --> 00:15:06,620
Honestly, I think you shouldn't sell it yet.

152
00:15:06,620 --> 00:15:10,123
My friend said that the surrounding land?

153
00:15:10,123 --> 00:15:12,313
It's almost all owned by the same person.

154
00:15:12,313 --> 00:15:16,953
And he said they're planning
to build a massive storage facility for lease.

155
00:15:16,953 --> 00:15:20,153
<i>Not soon, but definitely happening eventually.</i>

156
00:15:20,153 --> 00:15:23,760
Okay, it's alright.

157
00:15:23,760 --> 00:15:25,820
Thanks so much.

158
00:15:30,960 --> 00:15:33,080
What did Pitcha say?

159
00:15:33,700 --> 00:15:35,920
Her tone totally dropped.

160
00:15:36,821 --> 00:15:41,707
This lie wasn't bad, Laks.
We did it with good intentions.

161
00:15:41,707 --> 00:15:44,480
Even if Pitcha can sell the land now,

162
00:15:44,480 --> 00:15:49,573
who knows how long it'll take
before she can sell again?

163
00:15:49,573 --> 00:15:51,280
She's stubborn.

164
00:15:51,280 --> 00:15:53,694
If there's still a path forward,

165
00:15:53,694 --> 00:16:01,080
she'll take it no matter
how tiring or time-consuming.

166
00:16:02,240 --> 00:16:06,200
I feel bad for her.
The money's not worth the effort.

167
00:16:17,493 --> 00:16:19,707
Want to talk about anything?

168
00:16:19,707 --> 00:16:23,267
Just blurt it out, anything.
Might help ease the pressure.

169
00:16:24,493 --> 00:16:27,920
It's too much.
Don't even know where to start.

170
00:16:27,920 --> 00:16:29,693
Something about your family?

171
00:16:31,547 --> 00:16:34,567
- But nope, not in the mood to share.
- Fine.

172
00:16:36,533 --> 00:16:38,733
Let me know if you want help.

173
00:16:52,647 --> 00:16:56,300
Did Anita ask you to go to Shanghai?

174
00:16:56,300 --> 00:16:58,042
She told you?

175
00:16:58,042 --> 00:17:00,840
It slipped out.
Aren't you even a bit interested?

176
00:17:00,840 --> 00:17:03,560
If I were a guy, I'd go.

177
00:17:05,680 --> 00:17:07,193
Why?

178
00:17:07,193 --> 00:17:09,747
Okay, let me rephrase.

179
00:17:09,747 --> 00:17:14,753
If I were a guy who had land like yours, I'd go.

180
00:17:14,753 --> 00:17:20,673
She's really capable, you know?
If you went with her, you'd learn so much.

181
00:17:21,766 --> 00:17:26,687
If you really want
to increase the value of your land...

182
00:17:29,386 --> 00:17:32,127
Did she send you to tell me this?

183
00:17:32,127 --> 00:17:34,553
No! Of course not.

184
00:17:34,553 --> 00:17:37,800
She didn't even want to tell me.
It just slipped out.

185
00:17:37,800 --> 00:17:39,280
She said something like,

186
00:17:39,280 --> 00:17:43,087
"His land is stunning.
If done right, he could make a fortune."

187
00:17:44,033 --> 00:17:47,173
You two sure are interested in my land.

188
00:17:47,860 --> 00:17:52,233
I just think it's a great opportunity.
I'm saying this as a friend.

189
00:17:52,233 --> 00:17:54,653
Or do you not think of me as a friend?

190
00:17:54,653 --> 00:17:56,613
Come on, of course I do.

191
00:17:56,613 --> 00:17:59,140
Chill out, friend. Take it easy.

192
00:17:59,140 --> 00:18:00,640
Hey...

193
00:18:02,593 --> 00:18:03,927
You...

194
00:18:05,467 --> 00:18:08,287
You really don't plan to sell that land?

195
00:18:11,153 --> 00:18:14,400
No. Not right now.

196
00:18:15,120 --> 00:18:24,107
As your friend and a land broker,
let me be honest. Your land is amazing.

197
00:18:24,107 --> 00:18:27,180
It's A-list level.

198
00:18:27,180 --> 00:18:31,833
If someone offers you under 300,
don't even talk to them.

199
00:18:31,833 --> 00:18:38,807
But if one day you do change your mind
and decide to sell, let me know.

200
00:18:38,807 --> 00:18:43,500
I'll make sure you get a fair price.
No one's taking advantage of you.

201
00:18:43,500 --> 00:18:44,860
Okay?

202
00:18:44,860 --> 00:18:46,240
Deal.

203
00:18:47,773 --> 00:18:49,227
Deal.

204
00:18:50,807 --> 00:18:52,613
Deal it is.

205
00:19:11,156 --> 00:19:16,107
Hey, Gur. Why are you just standing here?
The bar's packed.

206
00:19:18,614 --> 00:19:20,627
I'm lazy.

207
00:19:20,627 --> 00:19:27,354
Wow, Gur, the hottest guy around
knows how to be lazy?

208
00:19:27,354 --> 00:19:31,313
You're out here flirting with clients
like your life depends on it every night.

209
00:19:31,313 --> 00:19:33,807
You jerk.

210
00:19:33,807 --> 00:19:35,840
Oh, right. Hey, Gur.

211
00:19:36,473 --> 00:19:38,747
Maprang called me today.

212
00:19:39,613 --> 00:19:40,840
She called you? What'd she say?

213
00:19:40,840 --> 00:19:44,360
She just asked
if you had dance practice or something.

214
00:19:44,360 --> 00:19:46,120
And what did you tell Maprang?

215
00:19:46,120 --> 00:19:48,380
I told her there's nothing.

216
00:19:48,380 --> 00:19:52,840
What? Why would you say that?
Use your brain a little, man!

217
00:19:52,840 --> 00:19:55,673
Wait, what brain?

218
00:19:56,320 --> 00:19:59,080
What's up with you two anyway?

219
00:19:59,080 --> 00:20:03,060
If something's going on between you and Maprang,
how would I know?

220
00:20:06,740 --> 00:20:08,807
What's going on?

221
00:20:08,807 --> 00:20:12,613
What's going on with you and Maprang, huh?

222
00:20:15,193 --> 00:20:22,320
Listen, remember this, we're just friends.

223
00:20:22,320 --> 00:20:25,560
There's nothing going on and nothing will happen.

224
00:20:28,787 --> 00:20:32,893
And if Maprang calls you again asking about me,

225
00:20:32,893 --> 00:20:35,800
pretend your phone broke, dropped in water,
or the battery's dead.

226
00:20:35,800 --> 00:20:38,320
Whatever it takes. Just don't answer.

227
00:20:38,320 --> 00:20:41,027
Got it? Don't respond.

228
00:20:43,193 --> 00:20:45,766
Friend? Yeah right, Gur.

229
00:20:46,660 --> 00:20:49,920
Please. Keep that crap to yourself.

Plew! Plew!

233
00:23:32,420 --> 00:23:34,080
I'm sorry.

234
00:23:34,780 --> 00:23:36,580
I'm really sorry.

235
00:23:37,700 --> 00:23:40,560
Plew, don't be mad. Please.

236
00:23:40,560 --> 00:23:41,800
I'm really sorry.

237
00:23:41,800 --> 00:23:44,047
Don't do that again.

238
00:23:44,047 --> 00:23:48,513
Okay, I won't. I promise. I swear.

239
00:23:48,513 --> 00:23:50,320
I'm sorry.

240
00:23:51,473 --> 00:23:55,587
What happened on the island, that's over.

241
00:23:55,587 --> 00:23:57,907
Don't think it'll happen again.

242
00:23:59,473 --> 00:24:02,793
Okay. I got it.

243
00:24:03,407 --> 00:24:05,187
I'm sorry.

244
00:24:06,080 --> 00:24:07,367
I want to go back.

245
00:24:07,367 --> 00:24:10,567
Okay, okay, let's go. I'll walk you back.

00:24:46,147 --> 00:24:49,273
- Did you have fun?
- Yeah!

248
00:24:49,273 --> 00:24:51,760
It was really fun.

249
00:24:53,980 --> 00:24:58,447
Want me to give you a ride?
Or are you heading somewhere else?

250
00:24:58,447 --> 00:25:02,160
Oh, I have work early tomorrow. Better head home.

251
00:25:02,160 --> 00:25:04,660
Wow, hardworking too, huh?

252
00:25:04,660 --> 00:25:08,447
- Gotta make a living.
- True.

253
00:25:09,053 --> 00:25:10,873
Unless you want to support me?

254
00:25:10,873 --> 00:25:13,333
Sure. I can do that.

255
00:25:13,333 --> 00:25:19,227
Then tomorrow, I'll come by your place
and move you in with me.

256
00:25:20,907 --> 00:25:24,233
Please, you can barely drive.

257
00:25:29,167 --> 00:25:33,647
Aw, look at you, worried about your friend.
So sweet.

258
00:25:34,407 --> 00:25:35,880

So, you're really going home?
Not going anywhere else?

263
00:26:01,200 --> 00:26:02,427
Yes.

264
00:26:02,427 --> 00:26:08,160
Or should I come continue the night
with you in your room?

265
00:26:08,160 --> 00:26:10,773
What fun stuff do you have in your room?

266
00:26:10,773 --> 00:26:15,480
Another time, okay?
I just need to grab something real quick.

267
00:26:15,480 --> 00:26:18,040
You can drop me off out front.

268
00:26:18,040 --> 00:26:20,840
What are you buying? I can wait.

269
00:26:20,840 --> 00:26:26,320
Better not, I'm just getting sanitary pads.
Pretty sure my period's coming.

270
00:26:36,147 --> 00:26:40,013
Maybe next time. Feel free to call me again.

271
00:26:44,082 --> 00:26:45,835

Boss.

275
00:28:30,400 --> 00:28:32,280
Your coffee.

276
00:28:35,640 --> 00:28:37,933
Have you heard from Pitcha?

277
00:28:39,493 --> 00:28:44,000
Only your younger brother called
to leave a message.

278
00:28:45,200 --> 00:28:47,587
What is it? Is something wrong with my mother?

279
00:28:47,587 --> 00:28:49,647
No, no, nothing like that.

280
00:28:49,647 --> 00:28:54,893
He just said your mom wants a car.

281
00:28:55,700 --> 00:28:57,433
A car?

282
00:28:57,433 --> 00:29:03,160
He said your second brother is moving back home.

283
00:29:03,160 --> 00:29:07,240
So your mom thought he should have a car.

284
00:29:09,707 --> 00:29:12,393
And what do they think I am, exactly?

285
00:29:30,900 --> 00:29:34,480
When I call, she won't answer.

286
00:29:34,480 --> 00:29:38,160
But when her son wants a car,
they just call and order one?

287
00:29:45,227 --> 00:29:50,313
If anyone calls again,
tell my mother to call me herself.

288
00:29:50,313 --> 00:29:53,847
And if she refuses to talk to me, then no car.

289
00:29:53,847 --> 00:29:55,153
She doesn't get anything. Period.

290
00:29:55,153 --> 00:29:58,687
Got it. Yes, Boss.

291
00:30:10,007 --> 00:30:13,287
You said your hometown is like this place?

292
00:30:14,027 --> 00:30:15,440
Yeah.

293
00:30:17,120 --> 00:30:22,147
My dad died just a few days
after my youngest sibling was born.

294
00:30:23,327 --> 00:30:26,600
My mom and I were exhausted.

295
00:30:27,753 --> 00:30:31,147
Working and raising a baby.

296
00:30:32,493 --> 00:30:35,633
Mom wanted everyone to get an education.

297
00:30:35,633 --> 00:30:37,440
Except me.

298
00:30:39,047 --> 00:30:42,540
So I secretly used my younger sibling's books
to learn.

299
00:30:42,540 --> 00:30:45,960
Reading and writing along with the little one.

300
00:30:46,933 --> 00:30:53,820
As I got older, I read newspaper pages
wrapped around vegetables and meat at the market.

301
00:30:56,033 --> 00:30:59,253
Later, I secretly saved money
to take a sewing class.

302
00:31:01,227 --> 00:31:03,980
Luckily, my mom found out.

303
00:31:05,120 --> 00:31:10,780
Wait, why do you say that was lucky?

304
00:31:13,213 --> 00:31:18,367
If I had taken that sewing class,
how would I be standing here with you today?

305
00:31:23,953 --> 00:31:29,240
If, back then,
I had done everything my mom told me to,

306
00:31:30,545 --> 00:31:35,993
I'd probably have ended up just like her.

307
00:31:35,993 --> 00:31:39,800
My whole life would be stuck in one place.

308
00:31:44,320 --> 00:31:51,200
Other than my family,
you're the only one who knows this.

309
00:31:56,880 --> 00:32:00,833
Yeah, it kind of feels like my job too...

310
00:32:01,760 --> 00:32:05,107
to listen to stories
people don't know who to tell.

311
00:32:06,593 --> 00:32:10,240
I hold a lot of secrets for a lot of people.

312
00:32:54,349 --> 00:32:56,661
- Yes, Anita?
<i>- Hello, Pitcha.</i>

313
00:32:56,661 --> 00:32:59,500
How are things going?

314
00:32:59,500 --> 00:33:01,193
Which things?

315
00:33:01,193 --> 00:33:06,360
The land in Sukhothai. And Jay.

316
00:33:07,448 --> 00:33:12,093
Regarding the land in Sukhothai,
I don't think it suits your project anymore.

317
00:33:12,093 --> 00:33:15,713
I did some digging and turns out

318
00:33:15,713 --> 00:33:19,520
the surrounding land will be turned
into a storage warehouse in a couple of years.

319
00:33:21,120 --> 00:33:23,360
You're a good person, you know that?

320
00:33:23,360 --> 00:33:28,920
Thanks for being honest
instead of just trying to sell me something.

321
00:33:29,853 --> 00:33:31,973
What about Jay?

322
00:33:31,973 --> 00:33:33,740
Have you two talked?

323
00:33:33,740 --> 00:33:37,620
A little, yeah. I'm trying to.

324
00:33:37,620 --> 00:33:39,433
Does he seem interested?

325
00:33:39,433 --> 00:33:44,713
He seems interested,
but he's still thinking about it.

326
00:33:44,713 --> 00:33:48,247
Give me a little more time.

327
00:33:48,247 --> 00:33:55,320
If the land in Sukhothai is off the table, Pitcha,
then there's only one thing left you can do.

328
00:33:55,320 --> 00:33:57,720
The only way I can help you...

329
00:33:59,420 --> 00:34:03,393
is to get Jay to come to Shanghai.

330
00:34:20,013 --> 00:34:24,360
Sighing like this, is the rent too high, dear?

331
00:34:25,477 --> 00:34:27,167
A bit, yeah.

332
00:34:27,167 --> 00:34:29,280
Could you lower it just a little?

333
00:34:29,280 --> 00:34:33,920
I can lower it to 15,000.
Any less and I might as well not rent it out.

334
00:34:33,920 --> 00:34:37,600
To be honest, I don't really need the money.
I just want to buy some lip balm.

335
00:34:37,600 --> 00:34:40,259
Right. Do you live here too, Auntie?

336
00:34:40,259 --> 00:34:43,600
Oh no, I live in that condo over there.
Ten minutes away by foot.

337
00:34:44,253 --> 00:34:46,727
So, are you taking the place?

338
00:34:46,727 --> 00:34:50,073
Yes, I'll take it.
Just give me two to three days to move my stuff.

339
00:34:50,073 --> 00:34:53,240
Perfect. I'll get the lease ready for you.

340
00:34:53,947 --> 00:34:58,977
Hope you don't mind me asking,
are you living alone or with a boyfriend?

341
00:34:58,977 --> 00:35:00,433
I don't have a boyfriend, Auntie.

342
00:35:00,433 --> 00:35:04,993
Oh? And you're not the partying type, are you?
No wild nights, loud music?

343
00:35:04,993 --> 00:35:07,310
No, I quit that life a long time ago.

344
00:35:07,310 --> 00:35:11,453
Great. I'll get the lease ready in two days.

345
00:35:19,040 --> 00:35:22,720
I think they're all fine,
except for the chocolate cake.

346
00:35:22,720 --> 00:35:26,754
But Laks likes chocolate cake, Mom.

347
00:35:26,754 --> 00:35:31,647
Who serves chocolate cake at a wedding?
It's bitter, it's bad luck.

348
00:35:36,173 --> 00:35:38,893
And you talked to Laks already, right?

349
00:35:38,893 --> 00:35:42,507
Yes, I told him what we discussed.
I don't think we can sell the land.

350
00:35:42,507 --> 00:35:45,920
Good. Then let's just stay quiet about it.

351
00:35:51,360 --> 00:35:53,000
Cha.

352
00:35:54,020 --> 00:35:56,767
Come help pick a cake.

353
00:35:56,767 --> 00:36:00,240
Come on, help your sister choose one.

354
00:36:00,240 --> 00:36:04,440
I've tasted so many I've got a headache.
It's too sweet!

355
00:36:04,440 --> 00:36:09,254
You two go ahead. I think they're all good.

356
00:36:09,254 --> 00:36:13,400
Fine, don't taste then.
Just go shower and come down for dinner.

357
00:36:13,400 --> 00:36:17,293
I ordered your favorite, crab curry.

358
00:36:17,293 --> 00:36:20,467
You go ahead. I'll pack my things.

359
00:36:22,054 --> 00:36:24,940
Mom, I already told you that I'm moving out.

360
00:36:47,807 --> 00:36:49,833
Where are you going to live?

361
00:36:49,833 --> 00:36:53,280
Sukhumvit. Near the train station.

362
00:36:53,280 --> 00:36:56,040
It's super convenient
for days I don't feel like driving.

363
00:36:56,040 --> 00:37:01,800
Do you really think moving out on your own
will change anything?

364
00:37:04,153 --> 00:37:11,760
Or are you just trying to prove that
no one can control you?

365
00:37:12,780 --> 00:37:16,380
Why do you always assume
everything I do is childish?

366
00:37:16,380 --> 00:37:19,007
Don't pick a fight with me.

367
00:37:19,007 --> 00:37:22,293
Everything I've tried to say,
everything I've tried to teach,

368
00:37:22,293 --> 00:37:26,613
if you think clearly, you'd see I'm right.

369
00:37:26,613 --> 00:37:28,832
Right about what?

370
00:37:28,832 --> 00:37:32,873
That I'm useless? That I don't make money?
That I'm not famous?

371
00:37:32,873 --> 00:37:36,693
That I don't have a rich boyfriend? Really?

372
00:37:36,693 --> 00:37:38,680
You're being ridiculous now.

373
00:37:40,047 --> 00:37:43,347
Honestly, Plearn isn't as perfect
as you think, Mom.

374
00:37:44,347 --> 00:37:48,147
Why are you dragging Plearn into this?

375
00:37:48,147 --> 00:37:49,840
I'm not.

376
00:37:49,840 --> 00:37:53,720
I'm just saying all the shiny,
picture-perfect things you see in her life,

377
00:37:53,720 --> 00:37:56,440
maybe they're not what they seem.

378
00:37:57,387 --> 00:37:59,140
What do you mean?

379
00:38:07,705 --> 00:38:10,165
What's not what it seems?

380
00:38:14,447 --> 00:38:16,920
Nothing. I'm going to pack now.

381
00:38:16,920 --> 00:38:18,567
See? That's just how she is.

382
00:38:18,567 --> 00:38:19,918
Plearn, sweetheart, don't.

383
00:38:19,918 --> 00:38:22,373
Don't want what?

384
00:38:22,373 --> 00:38:23,680
That nasty attitude.

385
00:38:23,680 --> 00:38:27,440
The moment things don't go her way,
she lashes out.

386
00:38:27,440 --> 00:38:30,100
She's been like this since she was a kid.

387
00:38:30,100 --> 00:38:33,661
Her life is going nowhere,
and she can't accept it

388
00:38:33,661 --> 00:38:37,113
so she tries to tear other people down too.

389
00:38:39,560 --> 00:38:41,187
Loser!

390
00:38:41,187 --> 00:38:43,160
Plearn...

391
00:38:47,160 --> 00:38:50,880
Plearn... Plearn...

392
00:39:36,727 --> 00:39:38,967
I'm leaving.

393
00:39:51,040 --> 00:39:52,753
Hey.

394
00:39:52,753 --> 00:39:54,467
Cha.

395
00:40:07,333 --> 00:40:12,267
Is she really going?
I thought she was just packing.

396
00:40:13,807 --> 00:40:17,027
Give it six months.
She'll come crawling back. Believe me.

397
00:40:17,027 --> 00:40:20,640
Cha acts like a child.

398
00:40:20,640 --> 00:40:23,967
Gets upset and runs away.

399
00:40:23,967 --> 00:40:26,773
And then she says
someone else is the one with the problem.

400
00:40:26,773 --> 00:40:31,207
As if you would have any problems.
She just says whatever she wants.

401
00:40:42,878 --> 00:40:46,272
And where am I even going to sleep tonight?

402
00:40:49,960 --> 00:40:52,400
[Aunt Samorn]

403
00:40:54,627 --> 00:40:56,053
<i>Hello.</i>

404
00:40:56,053 --> 00:41:00,200
I'm so sorry to bother you at this hour.

405
00:41:00,200 --> 00:41:08,447
Is there any way I could move in tonight,
and sign the lease later?

406
00:41:08,447 --> 00:41:12,560
<i>Why so sudden? It's almost 10 PM already.</i>

407
00:41:12,560 --> 00:41:14,147
Things didn't go as planned.

408
00:41:14,147 --> 00:41:15,560
If it's not convenient tonight,

409
00:41:15,560 --> 00:41:17,353
can I move in first thing
tomorrow morning instead?

410
00:41:17,353 --> 00:41:22,200
<i>Well, do you even have a place to sleep tonight?</i>

411
00:41:22,200 --> 00:41:25,720
I'll try to figure something out.

412
00:41:25,720 --> 00:41:31,240
<i>Alright, if you're coming tonight, then fine.
I'll have someone bring the key to you.</i>

413
00:41:31,240 --> 00:41:33,509
<i>I'll give them your number, okay?</i>

414
00:41:33,509 --> 00:41:36,712
Thank you so much, Auntie. Really, thank you.

415
00:41:36,712 --> 00:41:39,840
I'll transfer the rent right now, then.

416
00:41:57,713 --> 00:42:01,120
<i>Her life is going nowhere,
and she can't accept it,</i>

417
00:42:01,120 --> 00:42:04,733
<i>so she tries to tear other people down too.</i>

418
00:42:06,960 --> 00:42:08,433
<i>Loser!</i>

419
00:42:08,433 --> 00:42:11,947
<i>Everything I've tried to say,
everything I've tried to teach,</i>

420
00:42:11,947 --> 00:42:16,327
<i>if you think clearly, you'd see I'm right.</i>

421
00:42:21,200 --> 00:42:22,960
[Jira]

422
00:42:30,160 --> 00:42:31,880
[Jira]

423
00:42:37,720 --> 00:42:39,000
[Jira]

424
00:42:47,240 --> 00:42:48,893
Yeah?

425
00:42:48,893 --> 00:42:50,713
<i>Where are you?</i>

426
00:42:51,427 --> 00:42:53,393
What do you want?

427
00:42:53,393 --> 00:42:57,867
<i>You sound muffled. What's wrong? Are you okay?</i>

428
00:42:59,520 --> 00:43:02,513
If it's nothing important, can I hang up?
I'm tired.

429
00:43:21,220 --> 00:43:23,840
Why don't you ever tell me when something's wrong?

430
00:43:37,960 --> 00:43:40,280
What is it, Auntie? You sick or something?

431
00:43:40,280 --> 00:43:43,713
Can you bring the keycard to my new tenant?

432
00:43:43,713 --> 00:43:45,893
No, I'm playing a game.

433
00:43:45,893 --> 00:43:47,327
Come on...

434
00:43:47,327 --> 00:43:50,233
- Since when do you have tenants?
- I do now.

435
00:43:50,233 --> 00:43:54,293
- And do you know what time it is?
- Almost 10 PM.

436
00:43:54,293 --> 00:43:56,800
Exactly, I asked so you'd realize it's late
and maybe not make me do anything now,

437
00:43:56,800 --> 00:43:58,007
not to get an answer.

438
00:44:00,293 --> 00:44:02,313
- Fine, I'll send a Grab.
- No!

439
00:44:02,313 --> 00:44:05,800
What if the driver copies the keycard
and sneaks in to steal something?

440
00:44:05,800 --> 00:44:08,440
You go do it for me.

441
00:44:08,440 --> 00:44:12,367
Poor girl's probably waiting around by now.

442
00:44:12,367 --> 00:44:15,747
She looks sweet. Doesn't even have a boyfriend.

443
00:44:15,747 --> 00:44:18,840
When you get there, call this number.

444
00:44:18,840 --> 00:44:20,633
Go help your aunt out.

445
00:44:20,633 --> 00:44:23,473
- Thanks. Bye.
- Whoa, hey!

446
00:44:23,473 --> 00:44:25,480
- Auntie, your pillow!
- Thanks, Jira!

447
00:44:25,480 --> 00:44:27,211
Auntie Morn...

448
00:44:27,211 --> 00:44:29,560
Thanks again.

449
00:44:35,160 --> 00:44:37,000
[Pitcha]

450
00:44:52,007 --> 00:44:55,240
Why do you have to act like you have no one?

451
00:44:58,503 --> 00:45:01,716
Why are you sitting here crying alone like this?
