1
00:01:12,640 --> 00:01:15,200
- Sir.
- If you're leaving, then just go.

2
00:01:15,200 --> 00:01:17,947
Do you want the whole condo knocking
on my daughter's door?

3
00:01:17,947 --> 00:01:19,547
- Calm down first...
- Stop. Right now.

4
00:01:19,547 --> 00:01:21,272
Get out.

5
00:01:21,272 --> 00:01:24,480
Go ahead. I'll talk to my mom.

6
00:01:25,313 --> 00:01:26,813
Okay.

7
00:01:29,687 --> 00:01:33,640
Sir, could you please move my car for me?

8
00:01:35,453 --> 00:01:38,793
Here. I'll leave the keys with you
and come back down to get them.

9
00:01:38,793 --> 00:01:40,893
- Thanks a lot.
- Sure.

10
00:01:43,460 --> 00:01:47,693
You think staying here longer
will change anything?

11
00:01:47,693 --> 00:01:49,647
Not at all, I just want to explain
that it really wasn't anything.

12
00:01:49,647 --> 00:01:53,567
Someone like me doesn't need
to talk to someone like you.

13
00:01:54,593 --> 00:01:57,867
Mom, there's really nothing going on. I mean it.

14
00:01:57,867 --> 00:01:59,400
I'm almost thirty.

15
00:01:59,400 --> 00:02:03,587
Whether I have a man or a woman in my room,
whether anything happens or not,

16
00:02:03,587 --> 00:02:06,740
- it's my business, Mom.
- Your business?

17
00:02:06,740 --> 00:02:08,487
But you're my daughter!

18
00:02:08,487 --> 00:02:11,093
- Please calm down.
- Stop!

19
00:02:11,093 --> 00:02:14,280
You don't get to say anything. She's my daughter.

20
00:02:14,280 --> 00:02:15,447
I raised her!

21
00:02:15,447 --> 00:02:18,020
- But you can't treat her like this.
- Stop!

22
00:02:20,253 --> 00:02:22,180
Let me finish!

23
00:02:22,180 --> 00:02:24,193
- Mom.
- I'm not done talking.

24
00:02:24,193 --> 00:02:25,864
Then I'm sorry.

25
00:02:25,864 --> 00:02:27,944
Stop right now!

26
00:02:30,167 --> 00:02:33,767
Pitcha's dealing with a lot right now.

27
00:02:33,767 --> 00:02:36,993
A client suddenly canceled the contract
for no clear reason.

28
00:02:36,993 --> 00:02:42,047
And she just saw her father with another woman.
She's worried about how you'll feel.

29
00:02:42,047 --> 00:02:44,520
She's confused and doesn't know what to do.

30
00:02:44,520 --> 00:02:48,540
It's not wrong that you care about
your family's reputation. I understand.

31
00:02:48,540 --> 00:02:51,320
But maybe you should care a bit more
about the people around you.

32
00:02:51,320 --> 00:02:57,693
Raising someone doesn't mean
you can do whatever you want with them.

33
00:03:14,840 --> 00:03:16,240
Plew!

34
00:03:16,240 --> 00:03:18,487
Plew!

35
00:03:18,487 --> 00:03:20,020
Come down and talk.

36
00:03:20,020 --> 00:03:21,464
Plew.

37
00:03:21,464 --> 00:03:23,340
Come down.

38
00:03:24,574 --> 00:03:26,761
If you won't come out, then don't go.

39
00:03:33,047 --> 00:03:35,107
What are you doing? Get out of the way!

40
00:03:35,107 --> 00:03:37,487
Come down and talk!

41
00:03:42,167 --> 00:03:45,353
You're making my life so hard!

42
00:03:45,353 --> 00:03:47,320
Are you sure I'm the problem?

43
00:03:48,607 --> 00:03:50,253
Plew. Plew.

44
00:03:50,253 --> 00:03:52,720
Let go! Let go!

45
00:03:52,720 --> 00:03:55,587
Let go!

46
00:03:55,587 --> 00:03:57,160
Let go of me!

47
00:03:57,160 --> 00:03:59,280
Don't come down.

48
00:03:59,280 --> 00:04:00,893
Don't come down.

49
00:06:04,162 --> 00:06:06,889
Hey. Sweetie.

50
00:06:10,753 --> 00:06:12,980
What are you going to do now?

51
00:06:13,880 --> 00:06:16,560
Call Anita for me. Right now.

52
00:06:19,127 --> 00:06:22,000
I don't care about what just happened.

53
00:06:22,747 --> 00:06:25,087
Let Mom think whatever she wants.

54
00:06:25,087 --> 00:06:27,640
No matter what I do, it's never good enough.

55
00:06:29,047 --> 00:06:31,200
Don't think like that, Plew.

56
00:06:32,833 --> 00:06:34,900
Call her. Now.

57
00:06:34,900 --> 00:06:39,640
I want to know the reason, so I can fix it.
I want to move forward.

58
00:06:40,373 --> 00:06:43,640
I just want to succeed at something in my life.

59
00:06:45,560 --> 00:06:50,893
You're only looking at the bad side.
You closed the deal before.

60
00:06:50,893 --> 00:06:54,687
You're still Anita's exclusive agent in Thailand.

61
00:06:54,687 --> 00:06:57,093
Not anymore.

62
00:06:57,093 --> 00:06:59,600
And I want to know what happened.

63
00:07:21,198 --> 00:07:22,200
Hello?

64
00:07:22,200 --> 00:07:23,920
[Anita]
Hello, Ann?

65
00:07:24,413 --> 00:07:26,600
I need to ask something.

66
00:07:26,600 --> 00:07:29,427
Didn't you say we'd talk when I got back?

67
00:07:29,427 --> 00:07:33,920
I know, but this is urgent.

68
00:07:33,920 --> 00:07:38,133
Did you refer another Thai agent
to steal Plew's client?

69
00:07:38,133 --> 00:07:39,580
Plew?

70
00:07:39,580 --> 00:07:41,160
Who's that?

71
00:07:43,140 --> 00:07:45,360
I mean Pitcha.

72
00:07:46,233 --> 00:07:48,840
Oh.

73
00:07:51,967 --> 00:07:54,333
So? Did you?

74
00:07:54,333 --> 00:07:56,253
<i>Yes.</i>

75
00:07:56,253 --> 00:07:59,733
I referred a new agent to my friend.

76
00:07:59,733 --> 00:08:01,780
Why?

77
00:08:01,780 --> 00:08:04,493
Why would you do that?

78
00:08:04,493 --> 00:08:07,840
Before I answer that,
you need to understand something.

79
00:08:07,840 --> 00:08:11,293
It's normal.

80
00:08:11,293 --> 00:08:15,620
<i>Buyers have every right
to change their minds at any moment.</i>

81
00:08:15,620 --> 00:08:19,907
The bigger the purchase, the easier the change.

82
00:08:19,907 --> 00:08:24,640
Price matters. Connections matter too.

83
00:08:24,640 --> 00:08:28,920
And Pitcha's not strong in that area.

84
00:08:28,920 --> 00:08:33,734
If she's not strong, then why would you refer
someone else and cause her to lose her client?

85
00:08:33,734 --> 00:08:38,560
You said connections matter.
Pitcha was your Thai agent.

86
00:08:38,560 --> 00:08:44,226
Because she wasn't just helping me,
she was helping you.

87
00:08:44,226 --> 00:08:46,827
Until you fell in love with her.

88
00:08:49,253 --> 00:08:54,853
<i>And that's why I made her lose her client.</i>

89
00:08:55,993 --> 00:08:58,707
Because you love her.

90
00:09:00,480 --> 00:09:02,973
You can't do that, Ann.

91
00:09:02,973 --> 00:09:06,500
I can. I could do even more, if I wanted to.

92
00:09:06,500 --> 00:09:10,227
<i>Come back and talk to me like you said.</i>

93
00:09:10,227 --> 00:09:12,973
Negotiate with me properly.

94
00:09:12,973 --> 00:09:20,640
Otherwise, your Pitcha will have no place left
in this industry.

95
00:09:30,173 --> 00:09:32,373
What did you say to her?

96
00:09:34,387 --> 00:09:37,320
I didn't even mention you.

97
00:09:38,739 --> 00:09:41,539
Then why is she coming at me?

98
00:09:43,527 --> 00:09:44,960
It's just that...

99
00:09:46,220 --> 00:09:51,600
Ann told me she loved me,
and she said a bunch of other things too.

100
00:09:51,600 --> 00:09:57,653
I told her I understood how she felt,
because I feel that way about someone too.

101
00:09:58,469 --> 00:10:00,860
Then she kept asking if it was you.

102
00:10:00,860 --> 00:10:03,580
And what did you say?

103
00:10:03,580 --> 00:10:05,793
I told you I didn't say anything about you.

104
00:10:05,793 --> 00:10:10,693
But she kept pressing me again and again.
"Is it her? Is it Pitcha?"

105
00:10:11,513 --> 00:10:14,607
Then why didn't you just say no?

106
00:10:14,607 --> 00:10:18,087
How could I say no when it's true?

107
00:10:18,087 --> 00:10:20,480
I really do feel that way about you.

108
00:10:23,180 --> 00:10:25,380
When will you finally get it?

109
00:10:25,380 --> 00:10:29,900
That your love is making my life chaotic.
It's making me not okay.

110
00:10:29,900 --> 00:10:33,493
Can't you see? I don't care what anyone thinks.

111
00:10:33,493 --> 00:10:35,593
But this ruined my work.

112
00:10:35,593 --> 00:10:38,933
I've lost money. Lost opportunities.

113
00:10:42,758 --> 00:10:44,487
Then I'm sorry.

114
00:10:44,487 --> 00:10:46,283
Sorry?

115
00:10:46,283 --> 00:10:50,480
Yeah. Like you said to your mom.

116
00:10:50,480 --> 00:10:52,548
You said it because you didn't think
you did anything wrong.

117
00:10:52,548 --> 00:10:55,603
Same with me. I don't think I did anything wrong.

118
00:10:55,603 --> 00:10:57,263
Oh really?

119
00:10:58,360 --> 00:11:01,440
If I did anything wrong, it was falling for you.

120
00:11:03,200 --> 00:11:08,413
And if I could order myself to stop,
I'd make it stop right now, just to end all this.

121
00:11:19,590 --> 00:11:22,550
I want you to like yourself, Plew.

122
00:11:24,100 --> 00:11:28,140
You're talented. Kindhearted.

123
00:11:28,140 --> 00:11:31,520
Sure, sometimes you're unbelievably difficult...

124
00:11:32,593 --> 00:11:35,133
but you're never like that with anyone else.

125
00:11:36,113 --> 00:11:38,360
Only with me.

126
00:12:53,887 --> 00:12:56,080
Thanks.

127
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:02,434
Yes?

128
00:13:02,434 --> 00:13:05,480
Hey Goi, get in touch with Jack,
Anita's assistant.

129
00:13:05,480 --> 00:13:08,213
Tell him I want to set up a meeting
to discuss business.

130
00:13:08,213 --> 00:13:13,207
And tell the client who canceled the contract
the other day that we've got a new offer.

131
00:13:13,207 --> 00:13:15,467
We're cutting the price by 15%.

132
00:13:15,467 --> 00:13:17,867
You're undercutting the other agent?

133
00:13:17,867 --> 00:13:22,913
Yes. And tell them if they buy again next time,
we'll give them another 20% discount.

134
00:13:22,913 --> 00:13:24,787
Seriously?

135
00:13:24,787 --> 00:13:27,680
Send it. And get me that meeting with Anita.

136
00:13:52,200 --> 00:13:57,680
Boss, Pitcha is requesting a meeting via Zoom.

137
00:13:59,560 --> 00:14:01,007
Pitcha?

138
00:14:01,007 --> 00:14:02,460
Yes.

139
00:14:04,073 --> 00:14:08,367
Tell her I won't take the meeting.
Not because I don't have time.

140
00:14:08,367 --> 00:14:11,820
Tell her clearly. I just don't want to talk.

141
00:14:11,820 --> 00:14:13,640
Okay.

142
00:14:14,391 --> 00:14:16,458
When is Jay coming back?

143
00:14:16,458 --> 00:14:18,487
Tomorrow.

144
00:14:19,873 --> 00:14:24,147
Then I won't be in tomorrow.
Anything urgent, deal with it today.

145
00:14:24,147 --> 00:14:26,030
Got it.

146
00:14:26,030 --> 00:14:29,360
Want me to send a car for Jay?

147
00:14:30,140 --> 00:14:31,867
No need.

148
00:14:32,913 --> 00:14:34,400
Alright.

149
00:14:55,727 --> 00:14:59,360
- Hello, Gur.
- <i>Moo krata at my place?</i>

150
00:14:59,360 --> 00:15:01,927
<i>Before you leave, when are you going again?</i>

151
00:15:01,927 --> 00:15:03,473
Tomorrow.

152
00:15:03,473 --> 00:15:07,280
<i>Cool, come by. Maprang wants to see you.</i>

153
00:15:07,913 --> 00:15:10,200
Okay, I'll come.

154
00:15:22,948 --> 00:15:26,813
Let's celebrate.

155
00:15:26,813 --> 00:15:29,113
Wait, celebrate what?

156
00:15:30,348 --> 00:15:32,073
Everything!

157
00:15:32,073 --> 00:15:33,520
Celebrate not having to work today,

158
00:15:33,520 --> 00:15:36,893
celebrate having good friends
to eat moo krata with.

159
00:15:39,993 --> 00:15:42,200
Feels like we're missing Bew.

160
00:15:43,367 --> 00:15:46,820
Gur invited him,
but Bew said he wants to make more money first.

161
00:15:47,960 --> 00:15:49,760
Fair enough.

162
00:15:51,880 --> 00:15:54,687
So, are you really going to start a farm?

163
00:15:54,687 --> 00:15:57,000
Yeah, thinking about it.

164
00:15:57,000 --> 00:15:59,087
But I have no clue what I'm doing.

165
00:15:59,087 --> 00:16:01,547
No idea, but I'll try.

166
00:16:01,547 --> 00:16:04,933
What about you, Prang? What are you going to do?

167
00:16:04,933 --> 00:16:07,047
I want to work in wardrobe for TV dramas.

168
00:16:07,047 --> 00:16:10,593
I helped out for like four to five months.
It was so much fun.

169
00:16:10,593 --> 00:16:14,083
You get to dress people based on the story, right?

170
00:16:14,083 --> 00:16:16,613
But I don't want
to be someone's assistant forever.

171
00:16:16,613 --> 00:16:21,500
I want to take full contracts,
have a small team of two to three people,

172
00:16:21,500 --> 00:16:24,300
and make sharp-looking costumes
for big productions.

173
00:16:24,300 --> 00:16:27,613
- Sounds good?
- Sounds amazing.

174
00:16:28,240 --> 00:16:31,247
I think you can totally do it. I believe in you.

175
00:16:33,307 --> 00:16:37,320
What about you, bro?
When will you quit being a host?

176
00:16:37,320 --> 00:16:40,613
I just figured out how to do it right!
How to carry myself.

177
00:16:40,613 --> 00:16:44,080
I want to rake in tips for a year or two first.

178
00:16:44,080 --> 00:16:48,333
After that, I'll be old, right?
Time to get serious.

179
00:16:48,333 --> 00:16:53,680
I'm still waiting to see
who'll help me get there.

180
00:16:59,580 --> 00:17:03,600
Doesn't your contract have
just a little over a month left?

181
00:17:03,600 --> 00:17:05,167
Why are you canceling it now?

182
00:17:05,167 --> 00:17:06,760
Yeah, exactly.

183
00:17:06,760 --> 00:17:10,200
You just have to hang in there a little longer.
You'll get your payout soon.

184
00:17:13,767 --> 00:17:18,440
My client loves me, that's why it didn't work.

185
00:17:18,440 --> 00:17:23,296
When it got to this point,
it wasn't just that she got attached,

186
00:17:23,296 --> 00:17:25,247
she took it too far.

187
00:17:25,247 --> 00:17:28,907
It felt like I was taking advantage of her
or something.

188
00:17:30,480 --> 00:17:33,847
So? Do I look good? Cool, right?

189
00:17:35,107 --> 00:17:37,000
I'm such a good guy, damn.

190
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:38,853
It's good you did that, man.

191
00:17:38,853 --> 00:17:41,427
Yeah, true.

192
00:17:41,427 --> 00:17:44,720
Stuff like this is hard to talk about.

193
00:17:44,720 --> 00:17:46,393
Women, you know,

194
00:17:46,393 --> 00:17:51,753
if they sleep with someone more than
once or twice, they get attached.

195
00:17:51,753 --> 00:17:56,000
Doesn't matter how it started
or what the agreement was.

196
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:59,827
If the heart's not strong,
they can get thrown off course.

197
00:17:59,827 --> 00:18:05,587
My friends are like that with everyone.
That's why she doesn't want regulars.

198
00:18:08,207 --> 00:18:12,240
Is that why you won't eat rad na with me anymore?

199
00:18:13,880 --> 00:18:15,400
Hey!

200
00:18:15,400 --> 00:18:18,800
Don't talk like that when he's sitting right here.

201
00:18:18,800 --> 00:18:21,380
What's this rad na thing you two are on about?

202
00:18:22,020 --> 00:18:23,760
Nothing.

203
00:18:23,760 --> 00:18:26,320
How long do you think it takes
to microwave rad na?

204
00:18:26,320 --> 00:18:27,520
Stop.

205
00:18:29,013 --> 00:18:31,660
Gur, stop!

206
00:18:31,660 --> 00:18:34,920
I was just telling him. No big deal.

207
00:18:34,920 --> 00:18:37,773
- It's nothing, bro.
- He's Ji.

208
00:18:46,753 --> 00:18:48,880
- Ji.
- Yeah?

209
00:18:49,887 --> 00:18:53,400
You've been kinda quiet, huh?

210
00:18:55,473 --> 00:18:57,513
A bit, yeah.

211
00:19:00,489 --> 00:19:05,053
Hey, if something's bothering you,
you can talk to me, man.

212
00:19:05,053 --> 00:19:09,280
I may seem dumb, but I'm sincere.

213
00:19:10,160 --> 00:19:12,220
Thanks.

214
00:19:16,271 --> 00:19:17,600
Hey.

215
00:19:17,600 --> 00:19:20,973
Why'd you call a car? Don't you have your own?

216
00:19:20,973 --> 00:19:25,260
I parked it somewhere else last night.
Heading there now.

217
00:19:27,360 --> 00:19:29,320
Gur.

218
00:19:31,640 --> 00:19:34,427
Take good care of Maprang, okay?

219
00:19:34,427 --> 00:19:38,773
Don't mess with her, she's my sister.

220
00:19:40,247 --> 00:19:42,320
I'm not messing with her.

221
00:19:42,320 --> 00:19:46,640
You should tell your sister not to mess with me.

222
00:19:46,640 --> 00:19:48,293
I'm serious.

223
00:19:49,140 --> 00:19:50,507
Well...

224
00:19:51,367 --> 00:19:53,513
I'm happy for you.

225
00:19:54,813 --> 00:19:57,000
Really happy.

226
00:19:57,847 --> 00:20:06,460
Having someone who truly understands and
accepts everything about you, that's priceless.

227
00:20:12,613 --> 00:20:15,427
Thanks, man.

228
00:20:15,427 --> 00:20:17,267
Just send me to this point. I'll walk from here.

229
00:20:17,267 --> 00:20:19,171
- You sure?
- Yeah. See you later.

230
00:20:19,171 --> 00:20:20,578
Okay.

231
00:20:44,367 --> 00:20:45,640
Yes.

232
00:21:20,386 --> 00:21:22,480
<i>I'll talk to Ann for you, okay?</i>

233
00:21:22,480 --> 00:21:24,861
<i>I don't know how it'll turn out,</i>

234
00:21:24,861 --> 00:21:29,080
<i>but I promise you won't have to suffer
because of me again.</i>

235
00:21:29,080 --> 00:21:31,400
<i>I'm moving to Nan.</i>

236
00:21:31,400 --> 00:21:34,920
<i>If anything's bothering you,
and you need someone to talk to,</i>

237
00:21:34,920 --> 00:21:37,200
<i>come find me.</i>

238
00:21:45,120 --> 00:21:47,800
[Jira]

239
00:22:17,959 --> 00:22:20,979
Why is this so hard?

240
00:22:45,604 --> 00:22:47,766
You're still up?

241
00:22:53,400 --> 00:22:56,967
I've got something to tell you
about your favorite daughter.

242
00:22:58,458 --> 00:23:01,492
Pitcha brought a man to her place.

243
00:23:02,820 --> 00:23:10,260
That guy works at night,
as a bar host and a drink companion.

244
00:23:10,260 --> 00:23:14,173
Remember the guy who came with Anna that night?

245
00:23:16,682 --> 00:23:19,449
Maybe they're just friends?

246
00:23:20,720 --> 00:23:25,087
You really do see the world
through rose-colored glasses, don't you, Kitti?

247
00:23:25,087 --> 00:23:29,053
Did Araya teach you to be this way?

248
00:23:29,053 --> 00:23:34,347
Or have you always been like this,
and I just never noticed?

249
00:23:34,347 --> 00:23:39,387
Let's talk about one thing at a time.
Don't mix it all together.

250
00:23:39,387 --> 00:23:41,313
Okay.

251
00:23:41,313 --> 00:23:43,520
They're not friends.

252
00:23:43,520 --> 00:23:45,667
Because if they were,
he wouldn't be hiding in a closet.

253
00:23:45,667 --> 00:23:50,733
Wouldn't be sneaking around.

254
00:23:50,733 --> 00:23:53,302
You should know how things like this work.

255
00:23:53,302 --> 00:23:56,207
Alright. So how do you want me to help?

256
00:23:56,207 --> 00:23:58,880
Talk to her? Or what?

257
00:24:01,267 --> 00:24:02,713
Yes.

258
00:24:02,713 --> 00:24:06,080
And what am I supposed to say? Forbid her?

259
00:24:06,080 --> 00:24:08,888
Ask if they're together?

260
00:24:08,888 --> 00:24:12,450
You know I can't control things like this.

261
00:24:12,450 --> 00:24:15,777
I'm not exactly a moral example myself.
She knows that.

262
00:24:15,777 --> 00:24:17,633
And?

263
00:24:17,633 --> 00:24:20,756
So you're not going to do anything?

264
00:24:20,756 --> 00:24:25,080
You're just going
to let her date someone like that?

265
00:24:25,080 --> 00:24:29,531
You had a mistress
because you were a terrible husband.

266
00:24:29,531 --> 00:24:35,238
And now you're going to use that
as an excuse to be a terrible father too?

267
00:24:35,238 --> 00:24:38,857
Why are you so full of anger, Kotchakorn?

268
00:24:38,857 --> 00:24:43,280
Every word, every thought,
it drains everyone around you.

269
00:24:43,280 --> 00:24:44,360
Don't you see that?

270
00:24:44,360 --> 00:24:50,194
People full of anger
are often just full of sadness and disappointment.

271
00:24:50,194 --> 00:24:54,413
I shouldn't have to spell it out for you
what I'm sad about.

272
00:24:57,087 --> 00:24:58,760
And yeah...

273
00:24:59,967 --> 00:25:02,833
I probably can't warn her. She won't listen to me.

274
00:25:02,833 --> 00:25:08,360
But maybe she'll listen to you.

275
00:25:09,363 --> 00:25:14,587
If you do talk to her, tell her this.

276
00:25:14,587 --> 00:25:18,347
No matter what kind of relationship she has
with that man,

277
00:25:18,347 --> 00:25:20,790
it won't look good either way!

278
00:25:21,507 --> 00:25:23,823
Let me ask you seriously.

279
00:25:24,840 --> 00:25:30,565
If she ends up with him, can you really accept it?

280
00:25:51,620 --> 00:25:54,293
- Hello?
- <i>Hi, Dad.</i>

281
00:25:54,293 --> 00:25:56,787
Dinner tonight?

282
00:25:56,787 --> 00:26:00,573
I can't.
I've got meetings with two or three clients.

283
00:26:00,573 --> 00:26:03,313
Not sure when I'll be done. Another time?

284
00:26:03,313 --> 00:26:06,680
Alright, let me know when. You and I need to talk.

285
00:26:06,680 --> 00:26:10,433
Okay. I want to talk to you too.

286
00:26:10,433 --> 00:26:12,307
Bye.

287
00:26:52,480 --> 00:26:55,527
You came back from Thailand with just this?

288
00:26:55,527 --> 00:26:57,434
I didn't bring anything, really.

289
00:26:58,435 --> 00:27:01,673
Good. Less mess.

290
00:27:01,673 --> 00:27:04,753
Your stuff here is already piling up.

291
00:27:06,074 --> 00:27:08,980
Hungry? I haven't eaten yet.

292
00:27:08,980 --> 00:27:10,727
I'm starving.

293
00:27:19,087 --> 00:27:21,507
There's something I want to talk to you about.

294
00:27:21,507 --> 00:27:24,793
Talking while hungry isn't a good idea, trust me.

295
00:27:27,120 --> 00:27:32,013
Let's just eat something simple for now,
then go out for dinner later.

296
00:27:32,013 --> 00:27:35,200
I brought you a bunch of things, go take a look.

297
00:27:37,968 --> 00:27:41,200
I know I wasn't supposed to,
but I couldn't resist.

298
00:27:41,200 --> 00:27:43,987
- The stuff was...
- I want to terminate the contract.

299
00:27:44,940 --> 00:27:47,607
I want to go back to Thailand
earlier than planned.

300
00:27:54,533 --> 00:27:57,060
When I went back last time,
my grandma wasn't doing well.

301
00:27:57,060 --> 00:28:00,887
- My mom needs help too.
- If money solved everything, that would be fine.

302
00:28:00,887 --> 00:28:03,880
If your grandma's unwell, just hire someone.

303
00:28:03,880 --> 00:28:07,113
If your mom needs help, hire someone.

304
00:28:07,113 --> 00:28:11,787
You think you can split yourself
and do everything at once?

305
00:28:13,828 --> 00:28:17,913
Your best self right now
is the one that makes money,

306
00:28:17,913 --> 00:28:21,287
not the one that runs around doing all that.

307
00:28:21,287 --> 00:28:24,767
I don't want to just be someone who sends money,
like you.

308
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:30,880
Sending money is one thing,
taking care is another.

309
00:28:30,880 --> 00:28:34,510
My grandma is really old.
She might not have much time left.

310
00:28:34,510 --> 00:28:36,233
And my family needs someone there.

311
00:28:36,233 --> 00:28:38,573
Most importantly,
I don't want to do this job anymore.

312
00:28:38,573 --> 00:28:41,040
There's no contract termination.

313
00:28:41,040 --> 00:28:44,322
You'll stay until the agreed period is over.

314
00:28:44,322 --> 00:28:47,340
If not, go get a lawyer!

315
00:28:49,056 --> 00:28:51,676
- Ann!
- I won't allow it!

316
00:29:14,267 --> 00:29:17,193
Ann, don't do this. Let's talk it out.

317
00:29:17,193 --> 00:29:18,600
I'm not talking.

318
00:29:18,600 --> 00:29:22,953
I paid you to sleep with me, not to talk.
I'm not talking!

319
00:29:22,953 --> 00:29:25,087
You're usually cooler than this.

320
00:29:25,087 --> 00:29:26,593
Well, I'm not being cool right now!

321
00:29:26,593 --> 00:29:29,067
Ann, please.

322
00:29:30,660 --> 00:29:32,187
Did I not take good care of you?

323
00:29:32,187 --> 00:29:33,973
Did I not give you enough?

324
00:29:33,973 --> 00:29:36,890
- You know that's not the reason.
- Then what?

325
00:29:36,890 --> 00:29:38,747
Is it Pitcha?

326
00:29:38,747 --> 00:29:41,827
Because you love her? Because she told you not to?

327
00:29:41,827 --> 00:29:44,113
Because you want to go back
and be with her or something?

328
00:29:44,113 --> 00:29:47,004
Pitcha didn't even want
to be involved in my business.

329
00:29:47,004 --> 00:29:48,872
I'm the one who caused her trouble.

330
00:29:48,872 --> 00:29:52,213
What you did made her hate me.

331
00:29:52,213 --> 00:29:54,147
So that's why you're breaking up with me?

332
00:29:54,147 --> 00:29:56,436
We were never in a relationship, Ann.

333
00:29:56,436 --> 00:29:59,440
What we had was a transaction.

334
00:30:44,253 --> 00:30:45,880
Ann.

335
00:30:47,373 --> 00:30:50,733
I really appreciate the feelings you had for me.

336
00:30:51,667 --> 00:30:54,252
But I don't want to take advantage of you.

337
00:30:55,623 --> 00:30:59,367
If we had sex just for money, that's one thing.
That's clear.

338
00:30:59,367 --> 00:31:04,973
It's better than continuing to sleep together
when I know you love me.

339
00:31:17,260 --> 00:31:18,731
Ann.

340
00:31:19,520 --> 00:31:23,187
I don't want you to fall deeper
than you already have.

341
00:31:27,673 --> 00:31:35,040
If my heart's going to break,
let it be me the one who breaks it.

342
00:31:38,720 --> 00:31:40,800
But right now...

343
00:31:43,240 --> 00:31:45,241
Right now...

344
00:31:46,240 --> 00:31:48,640
I won't let you go.

345
00:31:49,280 --> 00:31:51,554
I won't.

346
00:32:40,107 --> 00:32:43,640
I once had a crush on a guy in my village.

347
00:32:45,953 --> 00:32:50,960
He was kind of simple and hardworking.

348
00:32:52,740 --> 00:32:55,080
But he already had a wife.

349
00:33:00,540 --> 00:33:03,080
I liked everything about him.

350
00:33:04,007 --> 00:33:07,140
I'd sneak to watch him work on his farm.

351
00:33:09,047 --> 00:33:13,547
Watch him eat under the tree.

352
00:33:17,100 --> 00:33:19,001
I liked him so much.

353
00:33:19,820 --> 00:33:23,740
I even thought I could be his second wife.

354
00:33:27,620 --> 00:33:30,720
And I was shocked by that thought.

355
00:33:33,693 --> 00:33:41,307
I didn't want to be second to anyone,
his or anyone's.

356
00:33:47,873 --> 00:33:49,573
One night...

357
00:33:51,273 --> 00:33:55,760
My mother scolded me for hiding money.

358
00:33:59,387 --> 00:34:02,187
She called me selfish...

359
00:34:03,560 --> 00:34:06,367
and chased me around the house.

360
00:34:08,440 --> 00:34:12,860
That night, I ran away.

361
00:34:17,807 --> 00:34:23,520
I left the town that made me feel worthless.

362
00:34:25,493 --> 00:34:27,840
No one loved me.

363
00:34:29,293 --> 00:34:31,693
I had no one to love.

364
00:34:49,284 --> 00:34:51,550
Some nights...

365
00:34:52,540 --> 00:34:54,860
while you were asleep...

366
00:34:55,987 --> 00:35:02,633
I'd watch you, just like I watched that man.

367
00:35:05,390 --> 00:35:07,877
When you ate...

368
00:35:09,100 --> 00:35:11,360
when you studied language...

369
00:35:13,460 --> 00:35:16,860
I could watch you all day.

370
00:35:17,880 --> 00:35:23,320
I didn't even realize when it started happening.

371
00:35:31,293 --> 00:35:33,773
If you leave me...

372
00:35:36,440 --> 00:35:39,520
I swear...

373
00:35:41,840 --> 00:35:47,320
Pitcha will never be happy again.

374
00:36:15,147 --> 00:36:16,320
Jack.

375
00:36:16,320 --> 00:36:20,193
Find me a flight to Bangkok tomorrow. Urgent.

376
00:36:20,193 --> 00:36:22,267
<i>How many seats?</i>

377
00:36:22,267 --> 00:36:24,233
Just one seat.

378
00:36:36,760 --> 00:36:37,960
<i>Hello?</i>

379
00:36:37,960 --> 00:36:40,040
Hi, Mr. Anan.

380
00:36:40,040 --> 00:36:42,613
It's me, Anita.

381
00:36:42,613 --> 00:36:44,207
<i>Yes, how can I help?</i>

382
00:36:44,207 --> 00:36:48,140
Sorry to call so late.

383
00:36:48,140 --> 00:36:51,640
How's the agent I sent working out?

384
00:36:51,640 --> 00:36:53,065
Any progress?

385
00:36:53,065 --> 00:36:55,380
Pretty good. Interesting, too.

386
00:36:55,380 --> 00:36:59,858
<i>But I still can't stop thinking
about Pitcha's land.</i>

387
00:36:59,858 --> 00:37:02,007
<i>That land is truly beautiful.</i>

388
00:37:02,007 --> 00:37:06,287
Please don't rush into any decisions.

389
00:37:06,287 --> 00:37:08,520
Shall we meet?

390
00:37:08,520 --> 00:37:11,767
I'll be in Bangkok for a few days on business.

391
00:37:11,767 --> 00:37:15,653
I've got some amazing title deeds to show off.

392
00:37:15,653 --> 00:37:17,800
<i>That sounds great.</i>

393
00:37:47,467 --> 00:37:49,160
Ann.

394
00:37:51,662 --> 00:37:53,364
Ann.

395
00:38:15,253 --> 00:38:18,400
Plew, it's been almost two hours now.

396
00:38:19,973 --> 00:38:23,040
But she promised us she'd come meet us.

397
00:38:24,507 --> 00:38:28,100
Should we try calling?
Maybe Mr. Anan is on the way.

398
00:38:28,100 --> 00:38:30,040
I'll call, okay?

399
00:38:38,877 --> 00:38:40,757
She's not picking up?

400
00:38:41,586 --> 00:38:44,106
She hung up on me.

401
00:38:47,727 --> 00:38:48,810
It's okay.

402
00:38:48,810 --> 00:38:51,233
Let's wait for Miss Joy first,
maybe her boss is still considering it.

403
00:38:51,233 --> 00:38:54,193
What time was the appointment again?

404
00:38:54,193 --> 00:38:57,453
According to schedule, in half an hour.

405
00:38:57,453 --> 00:39:01,160
Okay, I'll call to confirm then.

406
00:39:05,740 --> 00:39:10,527
Hi, Miss Joy.
Just confirming our appointment for today.

407
00:39:10,527 --> 00:39:13,480
I also sent the location earlier.

408
00:39:13,480 --> 00:39:17,133
Hi, Miss Goi.
Let me quickly check what my boss wants to do.

409
00:39:17,133 --> 00:39:18,720
Alright

410
00:39:22,029 --> 00:39:26,757
Miss Kat, Pitcha's assistant just called
to confirm the meeting.

411
00:39:28,160 --> 00:39:29,160
Cancel it.

412
00:39:29,160 --> 00:39:32,720
Tell them we're not interested anymore
so they don't have to keep waiting.

413
00:39:32,720 --> 00:39:34,087
Yes.

414
00:39:36,393 --> 00:39:40,580
Thank you so much for agreeing to meet with me
even though it was last minute.

415
00:39:40,580 --> 00:39:42,013
Please, Miss Ann.

416
00:39:42,013 --> 00:39:45,640
We're the ones happy to see you, truly.

417
00:39:46,387 --> 00:39:49,767
In a couple of days,
I'll send over the best agent I have.

418
00:39:49,767 --> 00:39:53,393
- I just want to pick the right one.
- Okay.

419
00:39:53,393 --> 00:39:56,907
- Let's take a selfie.
- Sure.

420
00:40:04,303 --> 00:40:07,430
Shall we head back to the office?

421
00:40:18,160 --> 00:40:21,560
[Time to celebrate!]

422
00:40:27,087 --> 00:40:28,353
- Hey.
- Move.

423
00:40:28,353 --> 00:40:32,200
Plew? Wait!

424
00:40:32,200 --> 00:40:34,400
Where are you going?

425
00:40:46,500 --> 00:40:51,200
Hello, Jack.
What time is Anita getting off work today?

426
00:40:51,993 --> 00:40:54,967
Oh, didn't she tell you she went to Thailand?

427
00:40:54,967 --> 00:40:57,580
What? When?

428
00:40:57,580 --> 00:40:59,380
This morning.

429
00:40:59,380 --> 00:41:02,120
Why'd she go? For how many days?

430
00:41:02,780 --> 00:41:08,567
I'm not sure why,
but I think it might be because of you.

431
00:41:10,800 --> 00:41:12,720
Jay.

432
00:41:12,720 --> 00:41:17,267
I think we need to talk about my boss.

433
00:41:24,660 --> 00:41:27,313
Plew, where are you going?

434
00:41:27,313 --> 00:41:29,513
To see Anita.

435
00:41:30,740 --> 00:41:33,940
And then what?

436
00:41:33,940 --> 00:41:36,280
What are you going to do to her?

437
00:41:36,280 --> 00:41:37,360
I don't know.

438
00:41:37,360 --> 00:41:43,400
I just really want to see her face
and ask why she did this.

439
00:41:48,487 --> 00:41:52,293
You must not tell Ann I talked to you about this.

440
00:41:58,320 --> 00:42:01,768
I think Ann loves you.

441
00:42:03,280 --> 00:42:06,285
Can you talk to me about the stuff I don't know?

442
00:42:08,752 --> 00:42:09,840
Okay.

443
00:42:10,695 --> 00:42:13,028
I'll say this.

444
00:42:13,917 --> 00:42:18,257
She's never softened before. You get that?

445
00:42:19,215 --> 00:42:22,073
She used to be heartless.

446
00:42:22,073 --> 00:42:24,273
Never hesitant, never sentimental.

447
00:42:25,160 --> 00:42:32,234
Sometimes, she'd send me pictures of outfits,
and ask me which one you would like.

448
00:42:32,234 --> 00:42:34,320
She loves you deeply.

449
00:42:39,547 --> 00:42:42,480
It means a lot to me that she likes me.

450
00:42:44,967 --> 00:42:49,840
Actually, I like her too as a friend.

451
00:42:50,800 --> 00:42:55,280
She's kind, generous, sweet.

452
00:42:58,280 --> 00:43:00,600
She's always been good to me.

453
00:43:01,291 --> 00:43:05,469
But I just don't love her.

454
00:43:06,740 --> 00:43:09,487
Then give it a chance.

455
00:43:09,487 --> 00:43:13,120
Some people marry without ever talking beforehand.

456
00:43:13,120 --> 00:43:15,598
One day, they fall in love.

457
00:43:17,587 --> 00:43:19,640
Let me tell you.

458
00:43:20,313 --> 00:43:25,253
Inside, Ann is soft, like silken tofu.

459
00:43:25,253 --> 00:43:28,467
She's not spicy like mala the way she acts.

460
00:43:33,920 --> 00:43:39,240
Last night, I asked to terminate the contract.

461
00:43:41,841 --> 00:43:44,688
I just don't want to take advantage of her.

462
00:43:46,660 --> 00:43:50,500
Jack, you have to help me. Talk to Ann.

463
00:43:52,174 --> 00:43:54,920
You're making her feel humiliated.

464
00:43:56,414 --> 00:44:01,533
And the one thing someone like Anita
can't tolerate, is losing face.

465
00:44:02,880 --> 00:44:07,473
She becomes scary when she feels like that.

466
00:44:11,753 --> 00:44:16,600
And the reason she went to Bangkok
was to see Pitcha, right?

467
00:44:17,600 --> 00:44:22,120
If Pitcha is the one you love, then yes.
