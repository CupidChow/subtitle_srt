1
00:01:19,093 --> 00:01:22,380
Should I go grab something from my room
for you to sleep on?

2
00:01:22,380 --> 00:01:24,427
No need.

3
00:01:25,887 --> 00:01:28,860
Honestly, I'd rather have you sleep in my room.

4
00:01:28,860 --> 00:01:30,020
It's fine.

5
00:01:30,020 --> 00:01:31,713
I'll sleep out here.

6
00:01:31,713 --> 00:01:33,607
You never really listen to me, do you?

7
00:01:33,607 --> 00:01:37,100
Well, you don't listen to me either.

8
00:01:37,100 --> 00:01:42,513
I'm really okay. It's just one night.
It's not a big deal.

9
00:01:43,967 --> 00:01:45,340
Alright.

10
00:01:45,340 --> 00:01:48,347
Then tomorrow morning, 9 AM,
I'll come help you move your things.

11
00:01:48,347 --> 00:01:51,540
And take you shopping for some essentials.

12
00:01:51,540 --> 00:01:53,520
I'm off. I'm free.

13
00:01:53,520 --> 00:01:55,347
I can help.

14
00:01:56,893 --> 00:01:59,990
And if I say I don't need help, is that a problem?

15
00:01:59,990 --> 00:02:03,200
No. But I'm still not listening.

16
00:02:04,233 --> 00:02:08,120
I know you're trying
to keep some distance between us.

17
00:02:08,120 --> 00:02:13,840
But if someone wants to help, let them.
Don't overthink it.

18
00:02:13,840 --> 00:02:18,360
To you, I'm just Ji. From Nan.

19
00:02:18,360 --> 00:02:20,560
That's it. Done.

20
00:02:20,560 --> 00:02:22,080
Okay?

21
00:02:24,280 --> 00:02:25,787
I'm off.

22
00:02:48,600 --> 00:02:55,740
<i>If your land in Sukhothai doesn't work for me,
then there's only one way I can help you now.</i>

23
00:02:55,740 --> 00:02:59,820
<i>Convince Jay to come to Shanghai.</i>

24
00:03:44,794 --> 00:03:46,020
Auntie Samorn.

25
00:03:46,020 --> 00:03:49,380
I made salted fish fried rice and cucumber soup.

26
00:03:49,380 --> 00:03:51,447
I figured you didn't have any groceries yet.

27
00:03:51,447 --> 00:03:53,227
Thank you so much, Auntie.

28
00:03:53,227 --> 00:03:58,600
- I was planning to sort things out today.
- Good, good.

29
00:03:58,600 --> 00:04:01,420
I brought a helper too.

30
00:04:03,194 --> 00:04:04,594
Hi.

31
00:04:08,647 --> 00:04:13,693
Don't be shy. Jira is really kind.

32
00:04:13,693 --> 00:04:17,440
He may look like that, but he's a good one.

33
00:04:17,440 --> 00:04:20,854
He takes me to my health checkups.
And he's not even my real kid.

34
00:04:20,854 --> 00:04:25,473
Sees someone carrying something heavy?
He runs right over to help.

35
00:04:25,473 --> 00:04:30,060
Even tears up when he sees sick stray dogs.

36
00:04:30,060 --> 00:04:32,333
If you need anything, just let me know, dear.

37
00:04:32,333 --> 00:04:35,927
Start small, build little by little.

38
00:04:35,927 --> 00:04:39,460
It's tough at first, but it'll come together.

39
00:04:39,460 --> 00:04:42,880
Now, eat up. You'll need the energy. I'm off.

40
00:04:42,880 --> 00:04:44,187
Return the tiffin when you're done, okay?

41
00:04:44,187 --> 00:04:46,007
Got it. I'll bring it over.

42
00:04:46,007 --> 00:04:48,747
Thanks again, Auntie.

43
00:04:48,747 --> 00:04:51,713
This generation talks a lot, you know.

44
00:04:51,713 --> 00:04:54,193
Go shower. I'll take you shopping after.

45
00:05:10,080 --> 00:05:11,120
[Anita]

46
00:05:13,720 --> 00:05:16,080
[Anita]

47
00:06:21,580 --> 00:06:25,060
Why don't you contact Jay yourself, Anita?

48
00:06:25,060 --> 00:06:28,047
About the land and Shanghai.

49
00:06:28,047 --> 00:06:31,840
This kind of opportunity, anyone would take it.

50
00:06:31,840 --> 00:06:33,920
I've already talked to him.

51
00:06:33,920 --> 00:06:38,293
Appearance fee, accommodations,
supplies, wardrobe.

52
00:06:38,293 --> 00:06:41,947
I offered everything, but he's not interested.

53
00:06:42,973 --> 00:06:47,800
So the more he's not interested,
the more obsessed you get?

54
00:06:49,753 --> 00:06:52,040
Exactly.

55
00:06:52,040 --> 00:06:57,773
These days, the only things money can't buy
are the most valuable.

56
00:06:59,105 --> 00:07:04,319
But you're this invested in him
because of the land too, right?

57
00:07:06,360 --> 00:07:09,433
That's the main reason.

58
00:07:09,433 --> 00:07:15,146
I know I'll get that land if he agrees to come.
I'm sure of it.

59
00:07:16,513 --> 00:07:21,413
Then why does it have to be Pitcha reaching out?

60
00:07:22,293 --> 00:07:29,320
I just need to know if what I feel is real.

61
00:07:40,413 --> 00:07:43,733
<i>Call me back urgently.</i>
[Anita]

62
00:07:45,560 --> 00:07:48,393
You want to eat first, or should we go?

63
00:07:48,393 --> 00:07:53,073
Let's go. But you go down first.
I need to take care of something quickly.

64
00:07:54,787 --> 00:07:56,474
Okay.

65
00:08:17,373 --> 00:08:21,506
Hello, Anita. Sorry, I missed your call earlier.
I was in the shower.

66
00:08:21,506 --> 00:08:23,120
What's up?

67
00:08:23,120 --> 00:08:25,886
I passed your contact to a friend of mine.

68
00:08:25,886 --> 00:08:29,570
He's looking for 10 rai of land
to build a vacation home.

69
00:08:29,570 --> 00:08:31,467
Thank you so much.

70
00:08:31,467 --> 00:08:38,613
I can give you hundreds more contacts
if you can deliver what I need.

71
00:08:38,613 --> 00:08:43,920
Understood. I'll talk to Jay as soon as I can.

72
00:08:43,920 --> 00:08:49,567
And I'll make sure
to fully take care of the lead you just gave me.

73
00:08:49,567 --> 00:08:52,480
Thank you again.

74
00:09:04,547 --> 00:09:06,320
Let's go.

75
00:09:16,713 --> 00:09:20,007
If there's something you want to say to me,
just say it.

76
00:09:20,007 --> 00:09:22,393
I saw Anita called.

77
00:09:22,393 --> 00:09:24,587
Fine.

78
00:09:24,587 --> 00:09:26,573
Let's talk.

79
00:09:27,393 --> 00:09:29,000
So...

80
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:34,580
I promised Anita
I'd try to talk to you about Shanghai.

81
00:09:37,287 --> 00:09:40,680
You can name your price. Whatever you want.

82
00:09:43,767 --> 00:09:47,260
Can you not interfere with my work?

83
00:09:49,240 --> 00:09:51,753
I'm not trying to interfere.

84
00:09:51,753 --> 00:09:55,653
I just don't get
why you'd pass up such a good opportunity.

85
00:09:55,653 --> 00:10:00,700
You'd get money, experience working with Anita.

86
00:10:00,700 --> 00:10:04,707
Go for a bit, come back with a big paycheck,
pay off your debts.

87
00:10:04,707 --> 00:10:07,920
You could even quit what you're doing now.

88
00:10:07,920 --> 00:10:12,353
If I were you, I'd go right now.

89
00:10:14,033 --> 00:10:16,600
And what do you get out of this?

90
00:10:18,667 --> 00:10:23,793
Doesn't matter what I get.
You should worry more about what you're missing.

91
00:10:23,793 --> 00:10:27,373
What missing out means to you and to me
aren't the same.

92
00:10:27,373 --> 00:10:30,493
Don't use your standards to measure my life.

93
00:10:31,200 --> 00:10:35,553
You're definitely going to regret it
if you don't think this through.

94
00:10:39,120 --> 00:10:42,140
Do you know why Anita asked you to talk to me?

95
00:10:42,140 --> 00:10:44,860
Because I can reach you?

96
00:10:44,860 --> 00:10:46,287
No.

97
00:10:46,960 --> 00:10:50,593
Because she knows I like you.

98
00:10:53,173 --> 00:10:54,767
You can't say that.

99
00:10:54,767 --> 00:10:57,340
It's too late.

100
00:10:57,340 --> 00:11:01,720
I already like you.
And I know you'll never get it.

101
00:11:01,720 --> 00:11:04,027
Did you tell Anita you like me?

102
00:11:04,027 --> 00:11:06,187
Can you care about me saying I like you first?

103
00:11:06,187 --> 00:11:08,293
Can you care about me saying I like you first?

104
00:11:08,293 --> 00:11:10,107
And did you tell her about that, too?

105
00:11:10,107 --> 00:11:12,853
What kind of person do you think I am?

106
00:11:15,093 --> 00:11:19,560
I don't know. I don't really know you.

107
00:11:20,593 --> 00:11:27,360
And whatever it is you're feeling,
I'm telling you now, there's no way it could work.

108
00:11:27,360 --> 00:11:28,553
No way.

109
00:11:28,553 --> 00:11:29,887
I'm quitting this job.

110
00:11:29,887 --> 00:11:31,273
Why?

111
00:11:31,273 --> 00:11:33,113
For myself.

112
00:11:33,862 --> 00:11:36,280
It doesn't feel good.

113
00:11:36,280 --> 00:11:40,873
If doing this job means
I can't truly feel anything for anyone.

114
00:11:40,873 --> 00:11:46,127
Even if you weren't doing this job,
there'd still be no chance between us.

115
00:11:49,308 --> 00:11:51,335
You sure?

116
00:11:54,153 --> 00:11:56,867
Look at me, really look.

117
00:11:56,867 --> 00:12:01,033
If I didn't do this work...

118
00:12:02,976 --> 00:12:05,976
if we'd just met like we already have...

119
00:12:08,153 --> 00:12:11,587
are you sure you wouldn't feel anything?

120
00:12:11,587 --> 00:12:12,927
Step back.

121
00:12:12,927 --> 00:12:14,273
No.

122
00:12:19,747 --> 00:12:25,927
Whatever you and Anita discussed, I'm out.

123
00:12:25,927 --> 00:12:31,220
If I can't close this deal with you, I'm screwed.

124
00:12:32,180 --> 00:12:38,520
When she contacted me, I gave everything I had
just to be her rep in this land deal.

125
00:12:38,520 --> 00:12:40,400
But I haven't sold a single plot.

126
00:12:40,400 --> 00:12:45,720
And I already told my family that this time,
I'd close a huge deal.

127
00:12:45,720 --> 00:12:48,267
So now you're trying
to tie a bow on me and ship me off?

128
00:12:48,267 --> 00:12:49,907
Right?

129
00:12:50,907 --> 00:12:54,107
It solves both our problems, doesn't it?

130
00:12:54,107 --> 00:12:56,680
You only ever use the word "we"
when it benefits you.

131
00:12:56,680 --> 00:12:59,120
You realize that, right?

132
00:12:59,120 --> 00:13:03,454
I just didn't think it would be that bad for you.

133
00:13:03,454 --> 00:13:06,574
Because I'm a guy?

134
00:13:06,574 --> 00:13:10,847
Or because of what I do,
you think there's no harm?

135
00:13:12,548 --> 00:13:19,854
No matter how good the opportunity is,
if I'm not willing, I'm not going.

136
00:13:19,854 --> 00:13:22,434
I... I just...

137
00:13:22,434 --> 00:13:25,040
You don't even want to work with your own sister.

138
00:13:25,040 --> 00:13:31,800
Don't you think you're missing out being
stuck as a land broker who can't even sell land?

139
00:13:51,440 --> 00:13:53,854
Fewer students nowadays, huh?

140
00:13:53,854 --> 00:13:58,480
Yes, now they just form
their own online tutoring groups.

141
00:13:58,480 --> 00:14:02,600
And the teaching style is fun, kids enjoy it.

142
00:14:02,600 --> 00:14:06,440
Plus, the prices are more affordable than ours.

143
00:14:08,047 --> 00:14:12,154
It's frustrating,
trying to compete with cheap options.

144
00:14:16,267 --> 00:14:18,477
Anyone promising?

145
00:14:18,477 --> 00:14:21,504
Quite a few, actually.

146
00:14:22,607 --> 00:14:27,640
Pick the best three or four,
and we'll see who stands out.

147
00:14:27,640 --> 00:14:29,547
Then we'll decide who to work with.

148
00:14:35,379 --> 00:14:38,487
What a surprise.

149
00:14:38,487 --> 00:14:40,660
I'll take care of it right away.

150
00:14:43,677 --> 00:14:45,300
Take care of what?

151
00:14:45,300 --> 00:14:49,907
Oh, nothing. Let's focus on these flowers instead.

152
00:14:49,907 --> 00:14:52,720
Such a surprise. Laks, are you hiding something?

153
00:14:52,720 --> 00:14:54,360
Nothing at all.

154
00:14:54,360 --> 00:14:57,987
I was nearby for work
and thought of my bride-to-be.

155
00:14:58,600 --> 00:15:03,373
Oh, and just wanted to remind you
about dinner with my family in a couple of days.

156
00:15:03,373 --> 00:15:06,966
Oh right! Crap.

157
00:15:06,966 --> 00:15:08,713
What's wrong?

158
00:15:08,713 --> 00:15:12,086
Cha just moved out.

159
00:15:12,086 --> 00:15:14,546
Did you two argue?

160
00:15:14,546 --> 00:15:16,833
It's about her land.

161
00:15:16,833 --> 00:15:19,853
She got upset and lashed out at me.

162
00:15:19,853 --> 00:15:22,846
So now I'm the one who has to go talk to her?

163
00:15:24,162 --> 00:15:27,333
It's nothing serious. Siblings are like that.

164
00:15:27,333 --> 00:15:29,873
Not with me.

165
00:15:31,443 --> 00:15:35,066
Laks, can you go talk to her instead?

166
00:15:35,066 --> 00:15:36,313
Please?

167
00:15:36,313 --> 00:15:37,240
Please?

168
00:15:37,240 --> 00:15:40,213
I really don't want to deal with her right now.

169
00:15:40,213 --> 00:15:41,473
Alright.

170
00:15:41,473 --> 00:15:43,553
Thank you.

171
00:15:43,553 --> 00:15:45,626
The flowers are beautiful.

172
00:16:38,053 --> 00:16:41,853
Hang on a sec, it's loud over here.

173
00:16:46,373 --> 00:16:47,640
Yes, Pitcha.

174
00:16:47,640 --> 00:16:50,853
How many days would you like
to book Jay this time?

175
00:16:50,853 --> 00:16:53,640
I think the client wants about six months.

176
00:16:53,640 --> 00:16:54,646
Huh?

177
00:16:54,646 --> 00:16:57,573
I'm here to finalize that with you.

178
00:16:57,573 --> 00:16:59,653
Okay.

179
00:17:00,506 --> 00:17:03,480
Let me think of a way.

180
00:17:03,480 --> 00:17:07,573
It's a really good deal,
but I'll need to talk to Jay carefully.

181
00:17:07,573 --> 00:17:08,926
I'll update you soon.

182
00:17:08,926 --> 00:17:13,520
Alright, just don't tell Jay
the idea came from me.

183
00:17:13,520 --> 00:17:15,246
Okay.

184
00:17:25,440 --> 00:17:29,520
[Laks]

185
00:17:30,393 --> 00:17:31,840
Yes, Laks?

186
00:17:31,840 --> 00:17:34,755
- <i>Want to grab a coffee?</i>
- Huh?

187
00:17:36,426 --> 00:17:38,446
Is there something you want to talk about?

188
00:17:38,446 --> 00:17:40,793
<i>A few things, yeah.</i>

189
00:17:42,966 --> 00:17:45,560
Okay, you guys bounce like this three times.

190
00:17:45,560 --> 00:17:48,060
- Wait for the beat to drop, then freeze. Got it?
- Got it, Gur.

191
00:17:48,060 --> 00:17:51,213
- Okay, do exactly as I said.
- We got it, Gur. Let's go.

192
00:17:53,360 --> 00:17:54,806
Whose fault was that?

193
00:17:54,806 --> 00:17:57,800
All done. Everyone knows the moves now.

194
00:17:57,800 --> 00:18:00,980
Good. Then take a break.

195
00:18:00,980 --> 00:18:02,880
How many shows tonight?

196
00:18:02,880 --> 00:18:08,046
Two. But if we've got a lot of guests,
we'll add a late set before closing.

197
00:18:08,046 --> 00:18:09,686
Got it.

198
00:18:09,686 --> 00:18:14,513
Hey, Gur, sit down.

199
00:18:15,186 --> 00:18:16,906
I've got a question.

200
00:18:16,906 --> 00:18:18,360
What is it?

201
00:18:19,360 --> 00:18:22,360
If someone offered to send you abroad
for five or six months,

202
00:18:22,360 --> 00:18:23,520
would you go?

203
00:18:23,520 --> 00:18:27,560
Of course! Wait, they offered to send me?
I'm already packing.

204
00:18:27,560 --> 00:18:29,280
They didn't.

205
00:18:29,280 --> 00:18:31,787
Even if they didn't, I'd still go.

206
00:18:31,787 --> 00:18:33,200
Tell you what.

207
00:18:33,200 --> 00:18:38,240
If you can make it happen, I'll give you...

208
00:18:38,920 --> 00:18:41,080
45%.

209
00:18:42,620 --> 00:18:45,987
Wow. I wish he'd blow up already.

210
00:18:45,987 --> 00:18:48,600
I'd be rich so fast.

211
00:18:51,707 --> 00:18:53,813
It's Jay, isn't it?

212
00:18:53,813 --> 00:18:57,600
Yeah. I'm trying to talk to him.

213
00:18:59,407 --> 00:19:01,227
But I know your deal.

214
00:19:01,227 --> 00:19:03,460
I'll try to help sell it too.

215
00:19:03,460 --> 00:19:06,673
You said it, 45%. I'm holding you to that.

216
00:19:06,673 --> 00:19:10,387
Sure. Just make it happen first.

217
00:19:10,387 --> 00:19:13,160
- I'm out.
- That's the hard part.

218
00:19:15,600 --> 00:19:18,500
Hey, let's eat.

219
00:19:24,393 --> 00:19:26,787
I heard from Plearn you moved out?

220
00:19:26,787 --> 00:19:28,533
Yeah.

221
00:19:28,533 --> 00:19:30,933
Because of the Sukhothai land?

222
00:19:31,800 --> 00:19:34,180
Not entirely.

223
00:19:34,180 --> 00:19:39,553
I've been wanting to move out for a while now.

224
00:19:39,553 --> 00:19:43,593
I get it.
Being Plearn's little sister can't be easy.

225
00:19:47,600 --> 00:19:53,760
As for the land,
I'll ask a friend to help find a buyer.

226
00:19:53,760 --> 00:20:00,500
Someone who'll take it as-is,
and keep you updated on any changes.

227
00:20:01,467 --> 00:20:04,313
- Thank you so much.
- No need to thank me.

228
00:20:04,313 --> 00:20:06,140
Just think of me as an older brother.

229
00:20:06,140 --> 00:20:07,407
Alright?

230
00:20:07,407 --> 00:20:13,780
Even though I haven't married Plearn yet,
treat me like family.

231
00:20:17,007 --> 00:20:21,527
Can I ask have you ever felt stifled
by being with Plearn?

232
00:20:23,753 --> 00:20:25,360
Me?

233
00:20:25,360 --> 00:20:33,640
She's picky, detailed,
but she's got a lot going for her.

234
00:20:33,640 --> 00:20:36,060
She's suitable?

235
00:20:38,437 --> 00:20:41,127
You could call it that.

236
00:20:41,127 --> 00:20:44,127
But marriage isn't essential for everyone.

237
00:20:44,127 --> 00:20:48,880
If you do get to that point, though,
you need someone who fits,

238
00:20:48,880 --> 00:20:52,573
someone right for the timing and the match.

239
00:20:53,300 --> 00:20:56,113
Why don't you ever talk about love?

240
00:20:59,200 --> 00:21:04,513
Because it's just one factor.

241
00:21:04,513 --> 00:21:06,500
Not everything.

242
00:21:07,180 --> 00:21:12,713
So is compatibility really that important
in your view?

243
00:21:13,520 --> 00:21:23,872
It is. Because in Thai society these days,
compatibility is the foundation of stability.

244
00:21:23,872 --> 00:21:25,627
Remember that.

245
00:21:32,240 --> 00:21:36,213
Oh, and don't forget the dinner on Friday.

246
00:21:36,213 --> 00:21:38,653
I'm really not in the mood to see anyone.

247
00:21:38,653 --> 00:21:40,393
Come on.

248
00:21:40,393 --> 00:21:42,920
Just act normal like I told you.

249
00:21:42,920 --> 00:21:45,100
It's important.

250
00:21:45,100 --> 00:21:50,187
My family's finalizing the wedding plans.
We want everyone there.

251
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:01,400
[Smile]

252
00:22:01,400 --> 00:22:02,320
[Bar Smile]

253
00:23:07,253 --> 00:23:12,967
We've got a job for Friday.
Anna, our client, wants you for dinner.

254
00:23:12,967 --> 00:23:16,500
She's paying 300K. She just agreed.

255
00:23:16,500 --> 00:23:19,367
Okay, done.

256
00:23:19,367 --> 00:23:23,813
And that thing about tutoring kids at the bar,
you still up for it?

257
00:23:23,813 --> 00:23:27,480
Of course, anytime.

258
00:23:27,480 --> 00:23:29,613
But I'm not sure it'll work out.

259
00:23:29,613 --> 00:23:33,593
Things like that depend on the person.

260
00:23:33,593 --> 00:23:36,020
Yeah, I get it.

261
00:23:37,547 --> 00:23:43,000
Honestly, if you want to quit,
maybe take one big job.

262
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:45,027
Make your money, then walk away.

263
00:23:47,360 --> 00:23:48,707
But...

264
00:23:49,993 --> 00:23:53,907
gigs that pay a million don't come easy, Jay.

265
00:23:53,907 --> 00:23:56,487
New kids are showing up every day.

266
00:23:56,487 --> 00:24:01,947
At your age, if you want to quit or cut back,

267
00:24:01,947 --> 00:24:06,513
only take the big jobs once in a while,
something that doesn't wear you out.

268
00:24:08,473 --> 00:24:09,641
Like this client,

269
00:24:09,641 --> 00:24:12,987
I've never had one like this before,
but if you're interested, I can sell you in.

270
00:24:13,647 --> 00:24:15,200
What are you talking about?

271
00:24:15,200 --> 00:24:17,647
Ten million. Twenty million.

272
00:24:19,880 --> 00:24:21,640
That's ridiculous, bro.

273
00:24:21,640 --> 00:24:26,140
Why would anyone pay that much
for something that isn't even real?

274
00:24:28,560 --> 00:24:30,280
Some people...

275
00:24:30,280 --> 00:24:33,740
Some people don't care if it's real or not.

276
00:24:33,740 --> 00:24:36,327
They've got the money, they'll pay.

277
00:24:36,327 --> 00:24:38,887
It's all about satisfaction.

278
00:24:38,887 --> 00:24:41,069
But twenty million?

279
00:24:41,069 --> 00:24:43,173
Who the hell pays that much?

280
00:24:43,173 --> 00:24:45,087
Well, some don't take Thai baht.

281
00:24:45,087 --> 00:24:47,873
They take yuan or yen.

282
00:24:47,873 --> 00:24:49,787
Japanese clients are out there.

283
00:24:49,787 --> 00:24:53,020
Hosts over there charge insane rates.

284
00:24:53,020 --> 00:24:56,367
Some can't afford it,
so they come looking around here instead.

285
00:24:59,212 --> 00:25:01,307
Let me think about it.

286
00:25:01,307 --> 00:25:04,673
As for quitting, I do want to.

287
00:25:05,587 --> 00:25:09,147
But let me figure out what to do first.

288
00:25:09,147 --> 00:25:11,600
Send me the job details from Anna, then.

289
00:25:11,600 --> 00:25:14,833
- Yeah, sure.
- Okay, I'm off.

290
00:25:15,713 --> 00:25:18,187
Just think it over.

291
00:25:24,753 --> 00:25:26,200
Hey.

292
00:25:26,200 --> 00:25:28,847
- Cha's meeting us here, right?
- Yeah.

293
00:25:28,847 --> 00:25:31,600
Alright, then you and Plearn head inside first.

294
00:25:31,600 --> 00:25:33,167
I'll handle a few things out here
and wait for her.

295
00:25:33,167 --> 00:25:37,480
Once she gets here, we'll come in together.

296
00:25:37,480 --> 00:25:40,360
Got it. Let's go.

297
00:25:42,407 --> 00:25:44,593
We didn't forget anything, right?

298
00:25:44,593 --> 00:25:45,753
I don't think so.

299
00:25:45,753 --> 00:25:48,420
They're here!

300
00:25:49,847 --> 00:25:52,093
- Hello, Mr. Danai, Mrs. Jeer.
- Hello.

301
00:25:52,093 --> 00:25:53,240
Hi, Kot.

302
00:25:53,240 --> 00:25:54,633
- Nice to see you.
- Hello.

303
00:25:54,633 --> 00:25:56,187
Where's Mr. Kitti?

304
00:25:56,187 --> 00:25:58,333
Still outside finishing up some work.
He'll be in soon.

305
00:25:58,333 --> 00:26:01,007
He's probably waiting for Pitcha too.
She might be a bit late.

306
00:26:01,007 --> 00:26:02,567
Let's take our seats first.

307
00:26:02,567 --> 00:26:03,827
- Sure.
- Nice.

308
00:26:03,827 --> 00:26:05,513
Right this way.

309
00:26:12,040 --> 00:26:15,667
The wedding's coming up soon. So much to do.

310
00:26:15,667 --> 00:26:17,200
So many guests too.

311
00:26:17,200 --> 00:26:19,573
I'm worried something might slip
through the cracks.

312
00:26:19,573 --> 00:26:23,900
Mom said she's more excited and stressed
than if it were her own wedding.

313
00:26:24,620 --> 00:26:26,847
In times like this, we need to keep calm.

314
00:26:26,847 --> 00:26:29,440
Same here. My head's spinning.

315
00:26:30,153 --> 00:26:33,440
Let's order some drinks while we wait for Pitcha.

316
00:26:33,440 --> 00:26:35,129
Good idea.

317
00:26:35,129 --> 00:26:36,660
Thanks.

318
00:26:38,666 --> 00:26:40,793
Pitcha, sweetheart.

319
00:26:40,793 --> 00:26:42,513
Dad!

320
00:26:44,933 --> 00:26:47,633
How are you? Where's Mom and Plearn?

321
00:26:47,633 --> 00:26:50,740
They've gone in. I stayed to finish a call.

322
00:26:50,740 --> 00:26:55,200
You didn't think to tell or ask me at all, huh?

323
00:26:55,200 --> 00:26:57,247
About moving out?

324
00:26:57,247 --> 00:27:00,080
Did something happen with your mom or your sister?

325
00:27:00,080 --> 00:27:03,280
You've been busy lately and barely home.

326
00:27:03,280 --> 00:27:05,647
I didn't want to bother you.

327
00:27:05,647 --> 00:27:10,400
Bother me? You're my daughter.

328
00:27:12,207 --> 00:27:17,493
I'm not against you moving out,
but you should've told me.

329
00:27:17,493 --> 00:27:19,533
I worry about you.

330
00:27:22,700 --> 00:27:27,653
Come have dinner with me soon, okay?
We'll meet near your new place.

331
00:27:27,653 --> 00:27:30,067
Okay, Dad.

332
00:27:30,853 --> 00:27:35,093
Mr. Kitti, hello.

333
00:27:35,093 --> 00:27:37,407
Hello, Anna.

334
00:27:42,460 --> 00:27:44,620
I heard you just got back from Milan?

335
00:27:44,620 --> 00:27:48,053
Yes, about two weeks ago. How are you?

336
00:27:48,053 --> 00:27:50,760
I'm well, thank you.

337
00:27:50,760 --> 00:27:53,233
This is Pitcha, my daughter.

338
00:27:53,233 --> 00:27:54,667
Hello.

339
00:27:54,667 --> 00:27:55,920
This is Anna.

340
00:27:55,920 --> 00:27:59,940
Her brand is the biggest Thai name
in Milan right now.

341
00:28:01,360 --> 00:28:03,480
I heard this restaurant is hard to book.

342
00:28:03,480 --> 00:28:05,467
Really? It's my first time here.

343
00:28:05,467 --> 00:28:07,707
- Oh, is that so?
- Please, have a seat.

344
00:28:07,707 --> 00:28:09,880
Thank you.

345
00:28:18,073 --> 00:28:20,333
That's Mr. Kitti.

346
00:28:20,333 --> 00:28:22,360
Wait, who's that with him?

347
00:28:22,360 --> 00:28:27,620
That's Anna. She owns the Anna clothing brand.
She's bringing her products to us.

348
00:28:30,060 --> 00:28:31,480
Hello, everyone.

349
00:28:31,480 --> 00:28:33,347
Sorry I'm late.

350
00:28:33,347 --> 00:28:34,233
Anna.

351
00:28:34,233 --> 00:28:37,593
- Hello, everyone.
- Hi.

352
00:28:37,593 --> 00:28:40,160
- This is Laks, my son.
- Hello.

353
00:28:40,160 --> 00:28:40,973
Hello.

354
00:28:40,973 --> 00:28:46,620
And this is Plearn, my future daughter-in-law,
eldest daughter of Mr. Kitti and Mrs. Kotchakorn.

355
00:28:46,620 --> 00:28:53,093
Lovely to meet you all.
And congratulations in advance.

356
00:28:53,093 --> 00:28:57,113
Make yourselves comfortable. I won't interrupt.

357
00:29:06,593 --> 00:29:08,587
Brought a handsome guy along too, huh?

358
00:29:08,587 --> 00:29:12,540
But he must not be her son.
She didn't introduce him.

359
00:29:12,540 --> 00:29:15,347
Probably just a party buddy,
someone to hang out with.

360
00:29:15,347 --> 00:29:18,453
Anna? She's really top-tier at that kind of thing.

361
00:29:18,453 --> 00:29:21,253
Like, you mean hiring someone
just to be a companion?

362
00:29:25,807 --> 00:29:28,053
Do you want these two dishes?

363
00:29:28,053 --> 00:29:31,860
Yeah, sure. I don't eat them often.

364
00:29:43,167 --> 00:29:46,153
- Dim sum?
- Yes.

365
00:30:00,580 --> 00:30:06,620
<i>Whatever it is you're feeling,
I'm telling you now, it's never going to happen.</i>

366
00:30:06,620 --> 00:30:08,847
<i>Never.</i>

367
00:30:12,833 --> 00:30:16,807
I'm going to Chiang Mai next week. Want to come?

368
00:30:17,861 --> 00:30:20,847
I'll need to check my schedule first.

369
00:30:20,847 --> 00:30:24,200
I can pay you double.

370
00:30:24,200 --> 00:30:26,553
Just check your schedule.

371
00:30:26,553 --> 00:30:29,020
Alright. I'll let you know.

372
00:30:43,960 --> 00:30:51,220
That table must be enjoying their meal even more
with us as their topic of gossip.

373
00:30:54,140 --> 00:30:56,667
You seem used to it.

374
00:30:57,300 --> 00:30:59,387
Not at all.

375
00:30:59,387 --> 00:31:02,047
I'm not used to it, and I don't like it either.

376
00:31:02,047 --> 00:31:05,880
But it's not something
I need to care about, right?

377
00:31:05,880 --> 00:31:10,893
I'd say my life is definitely happier than theirs.

378
00:31:17,820 --> 00:31:20,540
What makes you think that?

379
00:31:24,380 --> 00:31:31,900
People who are truly happy
don't look at others like that.

380
00:31:33,033 --> 00:31:44,720
At my age, I can go to temples, go on dates,
or post bikini pics on Instagram.

381
00:31:44,720 --> 00:31:47,327
My life is mine.

382
00:31:49,227 --> 00:31:51,167
Enjoy it.

383
00:31:53,748 --> 00:31:55,915
Amazing.

384
00:31:58,900 --> 00:32:00,535
Oops.

385
00:32:00,535 --> 00:32:03,260
So cute. Look, it got on you.

386
00:32:03,260 --> 00:32:06,700
This side can get messy too.

387
00:32:06,700 --> 00:32:09,020
- Did you see that?
- Cheers.

388
00:32:10,700 --> 00:32:12,993
- Thanks to Mr. Kitti.
- So inappropriate.

389
00:32:12,993 --> 00:32:17,373
I feel embarrassed
for both the child and his family.

390
00:32:20,017 --> 00:32:23,260
Next week, Plearn and I will start sending out
wedding invites.

391
00:32:27,113 --> 00:32:28,780
Mom.

392
00:32:29,620 --> 00:32:31,460
Yes, that's good.

393
00:32:33,662 --> 00:32:36,080
The earlier, the better.

394
00:32:36,080 --> 00:32:37,353
Okay.

395
00:32:37,353 --> 00:32:41,913
Cha, you need to help your sister at the school.
She's very busy right now.

396
00:32:41,913 --> 00:32:45,913
I've got work, Mom. But I'll try to drop by.

397
00:32:45,913 --> 00:32:48,080
Pitcha, you managed to sell your land, right?

398
00:32:48,080 --> 00:32:51,160
If there are any interesting projects,
let me know.

399
00:32:51,160 --> 00:32:53,700
Pitcha's still a newbie.

400
00:32:54,500 --> 00:32:57,511
I actually have some great organic plots.

401
00:32:57,511 --> 00:32:59,820
Perfect for vacation homes.

402
00:32:59,820 --> 00:33:05,487
The land is very peaceful.
No pollution at all in the area.

403
00:33:05,487 --> 00:33:07,560
If it's that great,

404
00:33:07,560 --> 00:33:10,700
I'm sure your Chinese clients
already scooped it up.

405
00:33:13,440 --> 00:33:16,560
I still have a lot to offer, Plearn.

406
00:33:17,320 --> 00:33:20,060
Excuse me, I'm going to the restroom.

407
00:33:26,511 --> 00:33:30,107
Pitcha's always like this.
Never listens to warnings.

408
00:33:30,107 --> 00:33:32,367
Always lost in her fantasy world.

409
00:33:32,367 --> 00:33:33,900
Plearn...

410
00:33:36,440 --> 00:33:43,447
I'm just checking names of old school friends,
thinking who else to invite.

411
00:34:04,269 --> 00:34:05,783
Hey.

412
00:34:08,653 --> 00:34:10,747
Why are you following me?

413
00:34:10,747 --> 00:34:13,327
- I...
- Leave me alone.

414
00:34:13,327 --> 00:34:16,220
I don't want anyone to see you talking to me.

415
00:34:16,220 --> 00:34:17,740
Plew.

416
00:34:21,060 --> 00:34:23,467
Stop calling me that.

417
00:34:23,467 --> 00:34:26,620
There is no woman named Plew.

418
00:34:52,700 --> 00:34:54,140
Hello, Nisa?

419
00:34:54,140 --> 00:34:56,187
Have you been checking the alumni group chat?

420
00:34:56,187 --> 00:34:58,720
No. Been busy. Why?

421
00:34:58,720 --> 00:35:00,533
Check it now.

422
00:35:00,533 --> 00:35:04,620
Da posted a photo of your sister, with some guy.

423
00:35:05,487 --> 00:35:07,407
Cha?

424
00:35:07,407 --> 00:35:12,187
So what if Cha has a boyfriend
or hangs out with a guy?

425
00:35:12,187 --> 00:35:15,873
Apparently that guy is a bar host.

426
00:35:15,873 --> 00:35:18,913
Everyone's gossiping in the chat.
You should go look.

427
00:35:18,913 --> 00:35:20,840
Fine.

428
00:35:35,200 --> 00:35:37,160
Wait.

429
00:35:45,580 --> 00:35:48,607
<i>Isn't that the high-priced host from Bar Smile?</i>

430
00:35:48,607 --> 00:35:50,393
<i>What's Bar Smile?</i>

431
00:35:50,393 --> 00:35:54,947
<i>Men who provide services.
That one's really in demand.</i>

432
00:35:54,947 --> 00:35:58,193
<i>Your sister must be paying a lot.</i>

433
00:35:58,193 --> 00:36:00,940
<i>What a model family.</i>

434
00:36:05,493 --> 00:36:08,867
Pitcha, meet me outside the restaurant now.
We need to talk.

435
00:36:08,867 --> 00:36:10,713
<i>What is it, Plearn?</i>

436
00:36:10,713 --> 00:36:12,320
Now!

437
00:36:18,195 --> 00:36:20,355
What is it, Plearn?

438
00:36:22,473 --> 00:36:25,180
You know that guy, don't you?

439
00:36:25,180 --> 00:36:27,380
Who are you talking about?

440
00:36:34,458 --> 00:36:38,105
The bar host with Anna.

441
00:36:39,687 --> 00:36:42,738
Why would you do something so shameful? Why?

442
00:36:42,738 --> 00:36:45,505
It's disgusting, Pitcha.

443
00:36:45,505 --> 00:36:48,787
What? Can't get a boyfriend?

444
00:36:48,787 --> 00:36:50,820
Are you that desperate, Pitcha?

445
00:36:50,820 --> 00:36:51,847
Plearn.

446
00:36:51,847 --> 00:36:57,307
Do you know they're gossiping about you
in the alumni chat?

447
00:36:57,307 --> 00:36:58,993
Hundreds of messages already.

448
00:36:58,993 --> 00:37:00,793
Can you let me explain?

449
00:37:00,793 --> 00:37:03,140
What if Mom finds out?

450
00:37:03,140 --> 00:37:05,693
Or Laks' family?

451
00:37:07,093 --> 00:37:10,173
How could you stoop so low, Pitcha?

452
00:37:10,173 --> 00:37:13,440
Walking around with a guy
who's with women old enough to be his grandma?

453
00:37:14,359 --> 00:37:16,239
Huh?

454
00:37:16,905 --> 00:37:21,225
Excuse me, are you talking about me?

455
00:37:22,007 --> 00:37:23,207
Well...

456
00:37:23,207 --> 00:37:27,253
If you're the only one around here
who offers services to women that age,

457
00:37:27,253 --> 00:37:29,187
then yes, probably.

458
00:37:30,200 --> 00:37:32,013
Plearn.

459
00:37:32,013 --> 00:37:36,193
Be grateful this is too embarrassing for me
to even tell Mom.

460
00:37:36,941 --> 00:37:40,495
Be grateful Laks' family is here today.

461
00:37:45,595 --> 00:37:47,380
Stay away from him.

462
00:37:47,380 --> 00:37:50,660
You could've said that better, she's your sister.

463
00:37:51,765 --> 00:37:53,985
Stay out of it.

464
00:37:55,637 --> 00:37:58,297
Your sister didn't hire me.

465
00:38:01,156 --> 00:38:03,607
And that photo?

466
00:38:03,607 --> 00:38:06,007
She contacted me for her client.

467
00:38:07,307 --> 00:38:09,940
And I don't sell my body.

468
00:38:09,940 --> 00:38:13,620
I just take care of people who want me to.

469
00:38:15,222 --> 00:38:19,315
Yeah, I can see the way you take care of people.

470
00:38:22,120 --> 00:38:25,527
Luckily my sister only contacted you for work.

471
00:38:25,527 --> 00:38:31,000
Because just breathing the same air as you,
is already damaging enough for her.

472
00:38:34,040 --> 00:38:39,080
Next time, think a little harder
before you do anything, Pitcha.

473
00:38:39,080 --> 00:38:40,760
That money?

474
00:38:40,760 --> 00:38:44,580
Would've been more useful
donated to stray animals.

475
00:38:48,740 --> 00:38:51,980
From now on,
I won't take any more work from you, Pitcha.

476
00:38:52,640 --> 00:38:59,140
Your sister's rude and disrespectful,
I can't accept that.

477
00:39:02,467 --> 00:39:04,547
Male escort!

478
00:39:06,373 --> 00:39:09,733
That's verbal defamation. I could sue.

479
00:39:09,733 --> 00:39:12,020
By myself, actually.

480
00:39:12,020 --> 00:39:17,499
If you want to bully people,
at least know the law first.

481
00:39:17,499 --> 00:39:19,318
Got it?

482
00:40:16,113 --> 00:40:19,060
Now I get your fear.

483
00:40:24,067 --> 00:40:28,460
I get what you've been carrying.

484
00:40:33,547 --> 00:40:36,380
Your sister is terrifying.

485
00:40:36,982 --> 00:40:39,402
I'm sorry on her behalf.

486
00:40:44,860 --> 00:40:49,580
And thank you
for speaking up and helping calm things down.

487
00:40:54,372 --> 00:40:56,599
I just told the truth.

488
00:40:58,659 --> 00:41:03,293
You were only reaching out
on someone else's behalf.

489
00:41:21,985 --> 00:41:24,872
If I weren't who I am...

490
00:41:27,114 --> 00:41:30,308
maybe we could've been friends.

491
00:41:36,947 --> 00:41:39,593
Maybe we could've been friends, Right?

492
00:41:47,540 --> 00:41:49,927
Maybe I could've told you I liked you...

493
00:41:52,963 --> 00:41:56,356
without you cringing in disgust.

494
00:42:23,373 --> 00:42:26,340
From now on, I'll stay out of your life.

495
00:42:28,687 --> 00:42:32,993
If you see me, just look past me.

496
00:42:32,993 --> 00:42:34,800
I understand.

497
00:42:35,833 --> 00:42:37,067
Hey.

498
00:42:38,437 --> 00:42:40,884
Take care of yourself, okay?

499
00:42:41,887 --> 00:42:45,060
Don't let your sister treat you that way again.

500
00:42:47,033 --> 00:42:48,860
I'm leaving.

501
00:43:36,727 --> 00:43:37,713
Hello?

502
00:43:37,713 --> 00:43:40,100
<i>Hey Gur, where are you?</i>

503
00:43:40,100 --> 00:43:41,487
At the bar.

504
00:43:41,487 --> 00:43:43,187
Let's drink.

505
00:43:43,187 --> 00:43:46,593
Damn, what's the vibe?

506
00:43:46,593 --> 00:43:50,440
Invite Bew and Maprang too. Same place, yeah?

507
00:43:50,440 --> 00:43:53,720
Cool. I'll call them.

508
00:44:04,040 --> 00:44:05,000
What?

509
00:44:05,000 --> 00:44:10,060
Jay told me to call and invite you.

510
00:44:10,873 --> 00:44:13,660
If Jay didn't tell you to, you wouldn't have?

511
00:44:13,660 --> 00:44:14,860
You in or not?

512
00:44:14,860 --> 00:44:18,607
Jay sounded kinda off today.
Wonder if something happened.

513
00:44:18,607 --> 00:44:20,493
Come on, we've all drunk for free so many times.

514
00:44:20,493 --> 00:44:23,227
He's down. Let's support him.

515
00:44:23,227 --> 00:44:25,553
Alright, alright.

516
00:44:25,553 --> 00:44:27,880
- That's it.
- <i>Okay.</i>

517
00:44:37,427 --> 00:44:39,060
Cheers.

518
00:44:39,060 --> 00:44:41,073
To Jay!

519
00:44:41,073 --> 00:44:43,453
Cheers.

520
00:44:43,453 --> 00:44:45,787
He's not dead yet!

521
00:44:45,787 --> 00:44:49,627
I meant to his mood, not to him dying!

522
00:44:49,627 --> 00:44:51,700
What the hell, man?

523
00:44:51,700 --> 00:44:56,040
Bro, you really look heartbroken today.

524
00:44:56,040 --> 00:44:57,473
Feels like it.

525
00:44:57,473 --> 00:45:01,627
Wait, you didn't fall for a client, did you?

526
00:45:01,627 --> 00:45:04,100
No, damn it. I told you I don't mess with clients.

527
00:45:04,100 --> 00:45:08,893
- Oh.
- Then who broke Jay the Great's heart?

528
00:45:08,893 --> 00:45:10,500
Sure.

529
00:45:11,720 --> 00:45:15,233
I fell for someone who doesn't get me.

530
00:45:16,780 --> 00:45:21,207
I said love, man. Like, real love.

531
00:45:21,207 --> 00:45:24,647
At first, I thought I just liked her.

532
00:45:24,647 --> 00:45:27,167
Now I know I love her.

533
00:45:27,167 --> 00:45:31,433
I fell in love with someone I shouldn't.

534
00:45:35,860 --> 00:45:38,493
That's sad, man.

535
00:45:38,493 --> 00:45:39,813
Cheers to that.

536
00:45:39,813 --> 00:45:42,413
To the ones we shouldn't love.

537
00:45:42,413 --> 00:45:44,987
To the ones we shouldn't.

538
00:45:46,220 --> 00:45:49,100
To the ones we shouldn't!

539
00:45:55,920 --> 00:46:01,713
- Hey, there's vodka too!
- Of course.

540
00:46:01,713 --> 00:46:04,180
<i>Male escort!</i>

541
00:46:06,287 --> 00:46:07,300
- Hey.
- Huh?

542
00:46:07,300 --> 00:46:09,398
This isn't vodka.

543
00:46:09,398 --> 00:46:10,867
It's just water.

544
00:46:10,867 --> 00:46:13,200
- Damn, man. You've had enough.
- Order another one!

545
00:46:13,200 --> 00:46:15,340
You okay to keep drinking?

546
00:46:15,340 --> 00:46:17,927
I could do three more bottles, easy.

547
00:46:17,927 --> 00:46:19,280
I can't anymore.

548
00:46:19,280 --> 00:46:23,060
Dropped your bag. Pick it up.

549
00:46:23,060 --> 00:46:24,153
Hey.

550
00:46:24,153 --> 00:46:27,060
Whose glass is this?

551
00:46:27,060 --> 00:46:28,973
Yours.

552
00:46:28,973 --> 00:46:30,940
I'm getting hungry.

553
00:46:43,380 --> 00:46:44,767
Hello.

554
00:46:44,767 --> 00:46:48,060
I want to talk about going to live with you.

555
00:46:51,247 --> 00:46:52,900
What did you just say?

556
00:46:52,900 --> 00:46:57,913
I want to discuss the terms clearly
if I'm going to Shanghai.
