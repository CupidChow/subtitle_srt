00:01:22,373 --> 00:01:23,687
Hello.

3
00:01:23,687 --> 00:01:27,080
I want to talk about me going to live with you.

4
00:01:30,073 --> 00:01:31,720
What did you say?

5
00:01:31,720 --> 00:01:36,520
I want to make the terms clear
if I'm going to Shanghai.

6
00:01:38,280 --> 00:01:40,873
Do you even know what time it is right now?

7
00:01:40,873 --> 00:01:43,587
You want to discuss terms at this hour?

8
00:01:43,587 --> 00:01:45,527
Sorry.

9
00:01:45,527 --> 00:01:48,084
I just want to know what I'd be expected to do.

10
00:01:48,084 --> 00:01:49,947
Take care of me.

11
00:01:49,947 --> 00:01:52,102
Live in my house.

12
00:01:52,868 --> 00:01:55,400
Sleep in the same room.

13
00:01:57,313 --> 00:02:01,160
Go on trips with me on weekends. Go have fun.

14
00:02:01,160 --> 00:02:04,587
Like we're a couple?

15
00:02:05,567 --> 00:02:08,720
Yes. Act like we're in a relationship.

16
00:02:20,480 --> 00:02:23,120
I'll send you the appearance fee to review first.

17
00:02:23,120 --> 00:02:25,602
Six months sound good?

18
00:02:25,602 --> 00:02:31,847
If I get bored, I'll send you back.
If not, we'll keep going and discuss a new rate.

19
00:02:31,847 --> 00:02:38,960
And that price doesn't include gifts,
lots of them, if you take good care of me.

20
00:02:54,800 --> 00:02:57,520
[Anita: I give 20 million baht.]

21
00:03:06,360 --> 00:03:09,809
You can drop me off here.

22
00:03:09,809 --> 00:03:12,980
- I'll go down myself.
- Hey, it's late.

23
00:03:12,980 --> 00:03:15,800
Just stopping to get snacks for tomorrow morning.

24
00:03:17,253 --> 00:03:19,253
- I'll take you.
- Huh?

25
00:03:19,253 --> 00:03:21,760
Once I drop her off,
I'll grab a ride nearby and head home.

26
00:03:21,760 --> 00:03:23,800
It's close by.

27
00:03:23,800 --> 00:03:26,267
- Really?
- It's in the opposite direction, Gur.

28
00:03:26,267 --> 00:03:28,753
Can you not say anything?

29
00:03:30,133 --> 00:03:32,513
Alright, alright. Get home safe.

30
00:03:32,513 --> 00:03:34,600
- Yeah.
- Make sure you all get home safely, okay?

31
00:03:34,600 --> 00:03:36,227
- Yeah.
- Bye, bro.

32
00:03:36,227 --> 00:03:37,553
- See ya.
- Later.

33
00:03:37,553 --> 00:03:40,287
- See you, guys!
- You really can't be trusted, can you?

34
00:03:41,313 --> 00:03:42,840
Let's go.

35
00:03:49,756 --> 00:03:51,733
You think it's happening, right?

36
00:03:52,449 --> 00:03:55,562
If one of them falls first, keep an eye on it.

37
00:03:56,953 --> 00:03:59,313
Yeah, got it.

38
00:04:01,513 --> 00:04:06,520
Even pros, once they fall in love,
they're clueless, huh?

39
00:04:09,187 --> 00:04:14,193
Sometimes you just can't help it, right?

40
00:04:14,193 --> 00:04:19,133
No, you have to help it.
If you can't, it's going to get messy.

41
00:04:19,133 --> 00:04:22,200
My friend once fell for a client

42
00:04:22,200 --> 00:04:27,360
because he kept saying
he was only staying with his wife out of duty.

43
00:04:27,360 --> 00:04:30,400
My friend believed him
and ended up being the mistress.

44
00:04:30,400 --> 00:04:35,828
In the end, she saw him walking with two kids
and pushing another in a stroller.

45
00:04:35,828 --> 00:04:38,547
Duty, huh? Must've been real committed.

46
00:04:38,547 --> 00:04:40,627
So what did your friend do?

47
00:04:40,627 --> 00:04:42,940
She left, of course. What else?

48
00:04:42,940 --> 00:04:45,233
She cried her soul out.

49
00:04:45,233 --> 00:04:47,667
I asked her, "Why are you so upset?"

50
00:04:47,667 --> 00:04:51,333
She said she'd been keeping herself together
for so long.

51
00:04:51,333 --> 00:04:54,360
She was just mad at herself for messing up.

52
00:04:57,207 --> 00:05:02,427
But sometimes love and responsibility,
it's hard to separate.

53
00:05:02,427 --> 00:05:07,706
When someone's lonely and you take care of them...

54
00:05:07,706 --> 00:05:11,587
Over time, your heart gets confused too.

55
00:05:11,587 --> 00:05:13,447
Not with me, that's for sure.

56
00:05:13,447 --> 00:05:17,267
Not with me either.
I was just bringing up Ji's story.

57
00:05:17,267 --> 00:05:21,760
But I heard you brought a client to your room.

58
00:05:23,587 --> 00:05:26,687
She came on her own.

59
00:05:26,687 --> 00:05:29,620
That's exactly the phrase that leads to trouble.

60
00:05:29,620 --> 00:05:32,207
She came on her own.

61
00:05:32,207 --> 00:05:36,160
Remember when you asked to come up to my room?

62
00:05:36,160 --> 00:05:39,507
And I said yes?

63
00:05:39,507 --> 00:05:42,767
And then things went too far between us?

64
00:05:42,767 --> 00:05:44,610
Come on, that was different.

65
00:05:44,610 --> 00:05:46,920
Do you like me, Gur?

66
00:05:50,449 --> 00:05:52,695
I like you.

67
00:05:53,974 --> 00:05:55,467
Good.

68
00:05:56,352 --> 00:05:58,505
I like you too.

69
00:05:59,660 --> 00:06:06,120
But if we're still doing this job,
it's better we don't move forward.

70
00:06:07,280 --> 00:06:11,720
Hooking up just because we're lonely
even though we like each other,

71
00:06:11,720 --> 00:06:15,200
it's going to mess us up.

72
00:06:21,400 --> 00:06:23,200
Maprang.

73
00:06:25,720 --> 00:06:28,033
You're not even going to try?

74
00:06:30,200 --> 00:06:32,255
I swear...

75
00:06:33,073 --> 00:06:35,667
I won't bring another client to my room.

76
00:06:35,667 --> 00:06:39,840
A client is just a client.
Once they leave the bar, that's it.

77
00:06:40,613 --> 00:06:44,193
You're not just being sweet
so I'll let you up again, right?

78
00:06:44,813 --> 00:06:48,800
Maprang, what do you take me for?

79
00:06:57,122 --> 00:06:59,568
I really like you.

80
00:07:00,200 --> 00:07:05,173
Sometimes... I even want you to quit this job.

81
00:07:06,817 --> 00:07:09,403
But the truth is...

82
00:07:10,988 --> 00:07:13,448
I can't afford to support you.

83
00:07:17,127 --> 00:07:19,007
But...

84
00:07:19,007 --> 00:07:25,087
How about this? Your dream and mine are the same.

85
00:07:25,087 --> 00:07:27,305
We both want a condo.

86
00:07:27,305 --> 00:07:31,613
You keep doing your work, I'll do mine.

87
00:07:31,613 --> 00:07:36,720
Let's save up together.
We'll buy a condo together.

88
00:07:46,873 --> 00:07:48,960
I'm serious.

89
00:07:51,047 --> 00:07:53,833
Even if you say yes today...

90
00:07:56,056 --> 00:07:59,183
I won't go up and eat noodles in your room.

91
00:08:00,020 --> 00:08:02,320
Just...

92
00:08:03,549 --> 00:08:06,269
give me a goodbye hug. A simple one. That's all.

93
00:08:08,040 --> 00:08:10,000
Let me think about it.

94
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:15,693
You being serious like this,
it makes me think even more.

95
00:08:21,951 --> 00:08:25,718
Sweet dreams, friend. Bye.

96
00:08:32,767 --> 00:08:35,287
Do friends treat each other like this?

97
00:08:47,560 --> 00:08:49,527
Hey! Pick up! Hurry.

- <i>What?</i>
- Dude...

99
00:08:51,080 --> 00:08:53,020
Gur likes me.

100
00:08:53,020 --> 00:08:56,320
He asked me to buy a condo together.
Can you believe that?

101
00:08:56,320 --> 00:08:57,373
He was so serious when he said it.

102
00:08:57,373 --> 00:09:00,613
I really think he has feelings for me.
Help me think this through. Quick!

103
00:09:00,613 --> 00:09:02,100

[How many drinks has she had?]
[She picked the top guy?]

107
00:10:26,920 --> 00:10:28,400
[That's one of the exclusive hosts, right?]

108
00:10:28,400 --> 00:10:29,880
[Acting like a princess?
More like a spirit haunting the place.]

109
00:10:32,840 --> 00:10:33,840
[She may seem quiet,
but she racks them up silently.]

110
00:10:33,840 --> 00:10:34,880
[She probably needs antibiotics now.]

Yes, I can. All of it?

00:11:01,973 --> 00:11:07,173
Yes. Jay agreed to come stay with me here.

117
00:11:07,173 --> 00:11:09,787
He called late last night.

118
00:11:09,787 --> 00:11:12,640
I don't know what you did,

119
00:11:12,640 --> 00:11:17,380
but if he agreed to come,
you'll get everything I promised.

120
00:11:18,100 --> 00:11:22,067
Call Jack and he'll tell you what to do next.

121
00:11:29,127 --> 00:11:31,520
You did it, Pitcha!

You're going to China for half a year?

Maybe less, I'm not sure yet.

But don't worry, my friends will take you
to your hospital appointments.

Everything will be the same.

130

How can it be the same? You won't be here.

00:12:39,992 --> 00:12:43,960
Yeah, something like that.

Call me sometimes, okay?

00:12:46,307 --> 00:12:48,747
Of course.

You can call me anytime too.

Don't eat too many sweets while I'm gone.

Yeah. How do you know?

She called me.

Why are you always so selfish?

You know I don't have a car. It's hard for me.

00:16:49,227 --> 00:16:52,640
If Mom refuses to see me,
don't expect anything from me.

178
00:16:52,640 --> 00:16:56,933
You're rich and still won't help anyone.

179
00:16:56,933 --> 00:16:58,827
Shameless.

180
00:17:00,207 --> 00:17:04,261
You understand English
because I paid for your classes.

181
00:17:04,261 --> 00:17:07,140
But all of you are useless. Get out.

182
00:17:07,140 --> 00:17:09,113
Get out!

183
00:17:09,113 --> 00:17:14,887
At least I'm the kind of child
Mom actually wanted to raise.

184
00:17:44,121 --> 00:17:46,774
She said she wanted to talk to you.

185
00:17:51,160 --> 00:17:56,107
She knows you're here, but you refused to see her.

186
00:17:57,433 --> 00:18:03,027
Why didn't you just tell her directly
that it's hard for you to walk?

187
00:18:03,027 --> 00:18:05,280
We've already come all this way.

188
00:18:05,280 --> 00:18:07,520
Would it hurt to just meet her for a moment?

189
00:18:12,446 --> 00:18:14,146
No!

190
00:18:21,880 --> 00:18:23,853
Mom, careful.

191
00:18:39,786 --> 00:18:43,280
Boss, next week there's a three-day meeting
for the water park project.

192
00:18:43,280 --> 00:18:44,880
Find me a van to choose from.

193
00:18:44,880 --> 00:18:48,040
One that has a wheelchair lift. Urgently.

194
00:18:48,040 --> 00:18:53,013
And get another wheelchair,
one for use at home, or outdoors.

195
00:18:53,013 --> 00:18:56,046
- Make sure it's the best.
- Got it.

196
00:18:58,360 --> 00:19:03,993
Also, contact Ah Chen, my younger brother.

197
00:19:03,993 --> 00:19:07,733
Tell him to take good care of Mom.

198
00:19:08,926 --> 00:19:11,000
Yes, ma'am.

199
00:19:24,960 --> 00:19:26,693
Funny, isn't it?

200
00:19:28,026 --> 00:19:36,693
That my only role in this family is to buy things,
send money.

201
00:19:38,120 --> 00:19:43,333
If I didn't have money,
I wouldn't even have a family.

202
00:19:47,966 --> 00:19:52,973
Let me say something not as your employee.

203
00:19:55,400 --> 00:19:58,340
You've done your best, Anita.

204
00:19:59,753 --> 00:20:08,386
If you hadn't made the hard choice back then,
your family wouldn't be living comfortably now.

205
00:20:12,173 --> 00:20:18,853
I guess my fate is to use money for everything.

206
00:20:20,460 --> 00:20:25,553
For family, for love.

207
00:20:59,846 --> 00:21:02,520
Pitcha, how could you do something so embarrassing

208
00:21:02,520 --> 00:21:05,086
and leave me and your sister waiting
all day like this?

209
00:21:05,086 --> 00:21:06,113
Hello, Mom.

210
00:21:06,113 --> 00:21:09,813
Have you even looked at the Line group?
Do you know how far the gossip has spread?

211
00:21:09,813 --> 00:21:12,031
They're even mentioning me and your sister.

212
00:21:12,031 --> 00:21:17,752
Are you really planning to just ignore it
and not defend our family?

213
00:21:17,752 --> 00:21:19,900
Has Plearn told you yet?

214
00:21:19,900 --> 00:21:24,640
That I know that man
because I was helping a client from China?

215
00:21:24,640 --> 00:21:25,800
She told me,

216
00:21:25,800 --> 00:21:29,593
but I thought you'd be ashamed enough
to explain it yourself.

217
00:21:29,593 --> 00:21:31,040
I didn't do anything wrong.

218
00:21:31,040 --> 00:21:34,020
The person who took that photo and posted it
is the one at fault.

219
00:21:34,020 --> 00:21:36,366
I'm going to take screenshots
and sue the whole damn school.

220
00:21:36,366 --> 00:21:39,644
You can't do that, it'll just make things worse.

221
00:21:39,644 --> 00:21:41,706
That's why we said we needed to talk first.

222
00:21:41,706 --> 00:21:44,600
Why would you think to do something like this?

223
00:21:44,600 --> 00:21:47,886
Cha, go make a short clarification.

224
00:21:47,886 --> 00:21:51,906
Show your evidence.
Bring it all out so it can end.

225
00:21:51,906 --> 00:21:54,046
- Fine. I'll handle it.
- Fine?

226
00:21:54,046 --> 00:21:56,933
I've been waiting all day. Do it now, Cha.

227
00:21:56,933 --> 00:21:58,813
Now!

228
00:22:06,300 --> 00:22:08,120
Actually, he's a good guy.

229
00:22:08,120 --> 00:22:10,153
Pitcha!

230
00:22:10,153 --> 00:22:13,573
He does that kind of work to support his family.

231
00:22:13,573 --> 00:22:15,993
He's never spoken ill of or judged anyone.

232
00:22:15,993 --> 00:22:20,413
Well, how could he judge others
when he does that kind of work?

233
00:22:20,413 --> 00:22:23,906
No more talking.
Go type your explanation in the Line group now.

234
00:22:23,906 --> 00:22:27,553
How could you let people misunderstand our family
for this long?

235
00:22:29,920 --> 00:22:33,153
Done. I sent it, Mom. I'm going now.

236
00:22:42,542 --> 00:22:47,920
Secretly taking a photo and posting it for others
to freely judge and mock,

237
00:22:47,920 --> 00:22:51,180
that's not something decent people do.

238
00:22:52,102 --> 00:22:54,306
What's this?

239
00:22:54,306 --> 00:22:57,013
I won't be explaining anything more.

240
00:22:57,013 --> 00:22:59,913
If you're that bored
and looking for something to do,

241
00:22:59,913 --> 00:23:03,840
go scrub the temple toilets.

242
00:23:03,840 --> 00:23:06,620
It'll purify your soul and your toilet.

243
00:23:06,620 --> 00:23:08,893
- Gosh!
- Pitcha...

244
00:23:12,306 --> 00:23:16,973
<i>I've taken a screenshot of everything.
Anyone who continues talking, I'll start suing.</i>

245
00:23:16,973 --> 00:23:20,500
- Pitcha!
- Pitcha!

246
00:23:32,066 --> 00:23:35,033
<i>Why would you do something so shameful? Why?</i>

247
00:23:35,033 --> 00:23:37,873
<i>It's disgusting, Pitcha.</i>

248
00:23:37,873 --> 00:23:40,300
<i>What? Can't get a boyfriend?</i>

249
00:23:40,300 --> 00:23:42,840
<i>Are you that desperate, Pitcha?</i>

250
00:23:44,620 --> 00:23:47,826
<i>How could you stoop so low, Pitcha?</i>

251
00:23:47,826 --> 00:23:51,253
<i>Walking around with a guy
who's with women old enough to be his grandma?</i>

252
00:23:52,918 --> 00:23:56,038
<i>Now I get your fear.</i>

253
00:23:57,013 --> 00:24:01,720
<i>I get what you've been carrying.</i>

254
00:24:04,300 --> 00:24:07,353
<i>If I weren't who I am...</i>

255
00:24:09,460 --> 00:24:12,680
<i>maybe we could've been friends.</i>

256
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:19,880
<i>Maybe I could've told you I liked you...</i>

257
00:24:22,426 --> 00:24:25,900
<i>without you cringing in disgust.</i>

258
00:24:28,866 --> 00:24:31,993
<i>From now on,
I won't interfere in your life anymore.</i>

259
00:24:34,254 --> 00:24:38,580
<i>If you see me, just look past me.</i>

260
00:24:38,580 --> 00:24:40,573
<i>I understand.</i>

261
00:24:42,106 --> 00:24:44,513
<i>Take care of yourself, okay?</i>

262
00:24:45,520 --> 00:24:48,853
<i>Don't let your sister treat you that way again.</i>

263
00:24:50,786 --> 00:24:52,733
<i>I'm leaving.</i>

264
00:25:07,346 --> 00:25:10,500
The other day Cha said she sold the land.

265
00:25:10,500 --> 00:25:14,593
Wow, impressive. She really did it.

266
00:25:15,336 --> 00:25:19,450
She said she sold all of it.
But who knows if that's true.

267
00:25:20,526 --> 00:25:23,413
You know our daughter isn't the type to lie.

268
00:25:24,689 --> 00:25:28,226
But she does have a stubborn streak.

269
00:25:28,226 --> 00:25:33,613
Now she's gotten herself into a mess,
and I'm stuck here dealing with it with Plearn.

270
00:25:35,953 --> 00:25:41,420
I've got a seminar in Khao Yai tomorrow morning.
I was planning to leave tonight.

271
00:25:42,913 --> 00:25:45,040
And because you're always away like this,

272
00:25:45,040 --> 00:25:47,826
you never know anything going on
with your own kid.

273
00:25:50,006 --> 00:25:54,813
Didn't you just go to Khao Yai last week?
Going again?

274
00:26:20,400 --> 00:26:22,446
<i>Yes, Dad?</i>

275
00:26:22,446 --> 00:26:25,040
I was calling to say congratulations
about selling the land.

276
00:26:25,040 --> 00:26:27,840
Your mom told me you sold all of it?

277
00:26:27,840 --> 00:26:29,420
Yes, Dad.

278
00:26:29,420 --> 00:26:31,940
<i>Great, well done!</i>

279
00:26:31,940 --> 00:26:36,253
So how about we have dinner next week
to celebrate?

280
00:26:36,253 --> 00:26:38,306
Sure, Dad.

281
00:26:38,306 --> 00:26:41,980
I'm proud of you.
Just let me know when you're free.

282
00:26:41,980 --> 00:26:44,733
Yes, Dad. Bye.

283
00:26:58,453 --> 00:27:00,333
Okay.

284
00:27:01,148 --> 00:27:03,260
The documents are all ready.

285
00:27:03,260 --> 00:27:05,246
Yes, everything's ready to sign.

286
00:27:05,246 --> 00:27:07,440
Alright, see you soon.

287
00:27:09,367 --> 00:27:13,593
All set, the land title deeds are also ready.

288
00:27:14,993 --> 00:27:19,639
Thank you so much. Sure, see you.

289
00:27:39,913 --> 00:27:42,393
Yes, Mr. Jack.

290
00:27:42,393 --> 00:27:46,493
Once the paperwork is done,
I'll inform you right away.

291
00:27:46,493 --> 00:27:48,293
Sorry, what was that?

292
00:27:49,073 --> 00:27:51,161
More photos of the seaside property?

293
00:27:51,161 --> 00:27:53,106
Alright, I'll send them immediately.

294
00:27:53,106 --> 00:27:55,279
Thank you, goodbye.

295
00:28:18,880 --> 00:28:21,600
[Jira]

296
00:28:42,600 --> 00:28:43,960
[Tiwa]

297
00:28:46,533 --> 00:28:47,640
Hello, Tiwa.

298
00:28:47,640 --> 00:28:50,793
Is Jay coming into the bar today,
or does he have an outside appointment?

299
00:28:50,793 --> 00:28:53,560
<i>He's coming.
He has to train the new boys at the bar.</i>

300
00:28:53,560 --> 00:28:55,434
<i>Is there anything I can help you with, Pitcha?</i>

301
00:28:55,434 --> 00:28:58,106
No, nothing. Thank you.

302
00:29:12,426 --> 00:29:14,466
Are you here to see someone?

303
00:29:20,453 --> 00:29:23,046
Miss Pitcha, hello.

304
00:29:23,046 --> 00:29:23,846
Hello.

305
00:29:23,846 --> 00:29:28,653
- I'm Prang, we met at the...
- I remember. I remember.

306
00:29:29,606 --> 00:29:34,140
The bar's not open yet.
Are you here to see someone in particular?

307
00:29:34,140 --> 00:29:36,673
Yes, I need to talk to Jay.

308
00:29:36,673 --> 00:29:38,480
Jay...

309
00:29:39,213 --> 00:29:41,686
It's about the land near his family home.

310
00:29:41,686 --> 00:29:44,913
Oh, perfect timing.

311
00:29:44,913 --> 00:29:47,420
I'll let him know you're here.

312
00:29:50,884 --> 00:29:54,144
Jay, someone's here to see you.

313
00:29:59,693 --> 00:30:03,100
Do you need something from me?

314
00:30:16,200 --> 00:30:18,846
- Prang.
- What?

315
00:30:18,846 --> 00:30:21,773
- What are you doing sneaking around here?
- Lower your voice.

316
00:30:22,426 --> 00:30:24,253
Who's that?

317
00:30:24,253 --> 00:30:26,426
Pitcha Kittikarn.

318
00:30:27,980 --> 00:30:29,986
Pitcha?

319
00:30:29,986 --> 00:30:31,613
Who's that?

320
00:30:33,306 --> 00:30:35,760
Plearn Kittikarn's younger sister.

321
00:30:35,760 --> 00:30:38,093
The one whose husband was into me.

322
00:30:39,566 --> 00:30:43,560
I'm sorry about the other day.

323
00:30:43,560 --> 00:30:45,880
I really didn't speak nicely to you.

324
00:30:45,880 --> 00:30:48,986
- I said...
- Forget about that day.

325
00:30:48,986 --> 00:30:51,086
You don't have to say anything.

326
00:30:51,766 --> 00:30:53,646
I made my own choice.

327
00:30:55,065 --> 00:31:00,338
I'm getting a huge payout.
Enough to quit this job for good.

328
00:31:01,546 --> 00:31:05,820
And I'll still have money left
to do something back home.

329
00:31:06,548 --> 00:31:10,655
Like you said, it's all gains and no losses.

330
00:31:13,153 --> 00:31:15,466
When are you leaving?

331
00:31:16,113 --> 00:31:19,866
Why do you ask? You planning to see me off?

332
00:31:20,665 --> 00:31:23,360
I could.

333
00:31:23,360 --> 00:31:26,133
You know, just a send-off vibe,
like friends saying goodbye at the airport.

334
00:31:28,673 --> 00:31:32,040
Did you really come here just to say this?

335
00:31:32,040 --> 00:31:33,644
I...

336
00:31:33,644 --> 00:31:39,133
If you're only feeling guilty, then don't.

337
00:31:40,386 --> 00:31:44,626
But if there's something else,
something you're scared to feel,

338
00:31:45,413 --> 00:31:48,026
then I don't know how to help you.

339
00:31:48,786 --> 00:31:53,013
Because I already told you I liked you.

340
00:31:54,061 --> 00:31:59,573
And you already told me it's impossible.

341
00:32:00,873 --> 00:32:05,426
So what can I do? It has to end.

342
00:32:05,426 --> 00:32:07,513
We have to go our separate ways.

343
00:32:09,220 --> 00:32:12,613
- I just wanted to say...
- If you like me,

344
00:32:12,613 --> 00:32:15,220
but hate the version of yourself
when you're with me...

345
00:32:16,760 --> 00:32:18,720
then I wouldn't be okay with that.

346
00:32:18,720 --> 00:32:22,593
You'd be the one who doesn't like yourself
when you're with me.

347
00:32:24,433 --> 00:32:27,306
My family... they'd never understand this.

348
00:32:27,306 --> 00:32:31,560
My mom and my sister are ready
to be cruel to anyone.

349
00:32:31,560 --> 00:32:36,786
If they don't get it,
I can't stand to see you hurt like that.

350
00:32:43,613 --> 00:32:48,260
That night, I felt terrible.

351
00:32:49,066 --> 00:32:56,533
And I kept thinking
who do I really have in my life?

352
00:32:56,533 --> 00:33:01,333
Who can I be weak with? Silly with?

353
00:33:04,466 --> 00:33:06,693
And I realized...

354
00:33:07,920 --> 00:33:10,213
I have no one.

355
00:33:11,246 --> 00:33:13,253
Except you.

356
00:33:17,440 --> 00:33:28,200
So, I'm sorry for not being brave enough
to stand beside you.

357
00:33:46,364 --> 00:33:50,694
Hey, drama incoming.

358
00:33:50,694 --> 00:33:54,320
Yeah, I better go check on Pitcha.

359
00:33:54,320 --> 00:33:55,450
She doesn't look okay.

360
00:33:55,450 --> 00:33:58,626
- Wait, I'll go check on Jay.
- Okay.

361
00:34:16,341 --> 00:34:18,166
Pitcha?

362
00:34:18,166 --> 00:34:22,706
Pitcha... are you alright?

363
00:34:23,913 --> 00:34:26,237
I'm fine.

364
00:34:26,237 --> 00:34:28,360
You and Jay...

365
00:34:28,360 --> 00:34:31,493
- Excuse me.
- Pitcha.

366
00:34:32,786 --> 00:34:35,453
Jay is a really good guy.

367
00:34:36,440 --> 00:34:39,306
Yes. I know.

368
00:34:50,160 --> 00:34:51,840
[Bar Smile]

369
00:35:06,620 --> 00:35:12,213
Hey, shall we keep going?
Grab a beer? I'll treat.

370
00:35:12,213 --> 00:35:15,526
Why would you treat?
It should be Boss Tiwa's treat.

371
00:35:15,526 --> 00:35:17,746
It's the last night, man.

372
00:35:18,766 --> 00:35:20,479
What?

373
00:35:21,611 --> 00:35:23,860
I'm quitting, Gur.

374
00:35:23,860 --> 00:35:25,506
Hey!

375
00:35:28,097 --> 00:35:30,230
I'm tired of this.

376
00:35:30,944 --> 00:35:33,224
But you're at your peak, man.

377
00:35:36,886 --> 00:35:39,633
Is it because of that woman,
the one who got you drunk?

378
00:35:39,633 --> 00:35:42,293
Did she make you quit?

379
00:35:43,746 --> 00:35:45,813
No. It's not that.

380
00:35:46,733 --> 00:35:50,253
She didn't do anything.
I just want to quit on my own.

381
00:35:53,328 --> 00:35:58,241
You have to do what I told you, okay?

382
00:35:59,026 --> 00:36:04,280
Someday, you'll have everything, just like I did.

383
00:36:07,066 --> 00:36:11,246
Save up, then find something else to do.

384
00:36:11,246 --> 00:36:13,026
Trust me.

385
00:36:14,366 --> 00:36:16,540
Are you serious?

386
00:36:18,313 --> 00:36:21,533
At first, I was never ashamed of this job,
you know?

387
00:36:22,193 --> 00:36:24,513
Because it didn't hurt anyone.

388
00:36:24,513 --> 00:36:26,773
I wasn't taking advantage of anyone.

389
00:36:29,346 --> 00:36:32,573
But not everyone really understands.

390
00:36:38,320 --> 00:36:40,233
I just want to be...

391
00:36:42,600 --> 00:36:44,727
good enough.

392
00:36:47,473 --> 00:36:50,400
For the one I want to see me that way.

393
00:36:52,813 --> 00:36:54,880
I can't change the past.

394
00:36:56,393 --> 00:36:59,093
But I'm going to reset my present.

395
00:36:59,915 --> 00:37:01,949
I look handsome, right?

396
00:37:03,887 --> 00:37:06,814
Hey, good luck, man.

397
00:37:10,553 --> 00:37:13,733
I wanna go with him too.
Maybe I'll get to live the high life for once.

398
00:37:13,733 --> 00:37:15,126
You wanna go?

399
00:37:15,126 --> 00:37:17,040
- Of course I do, Gur.
- You wanna go with him?

400
00:37:17,040 --> 00:37:18,018
- Of course I do.
- You wanna go?

401
00:37:18,018 --> 00:37:20,286
Then you'd better be a top host like him.

402
00:37:20,286 --> 00:37:22,573
Step aside. Move it.

403
00:37:23,886 --> 00:37:26,093
I was gonna ask him for his secret.

404
00:37:26,973 --> 00:37:28,893
Hey.

405
00:37:34,446 --> 00:37:35,873
- The other day...
- Yeah?

406
00:37:35,873 --> 00:37:37,760
We had a couple people come apply for the job.

407
00:37:37,760 --> 00:37:39,280
How was it?

408
00:37:39,280 --> 00:37:41,360
All had high degrees.

409
00:37:41,360 --> 00:37:45,653
But they said the average graduate salary
was too low to survive on.

410
00:37:45,653 --> 00:37:48,726
Another one said
he didn't want to work under anyone.

411
00:37:50,280 --> 00:37:54,360
I think this job's becoming
a legit career path now.

412
00:37:54,360 --> 00:37:56,353
Totally agree, boss.

413
00:38:00,453 --> 00:38:02,933
I'm glad you finally got out.

414
00:38:02,933 --> 00:38:05,033
My head's gonna explode.

415
00:38:05,033 --> 00:38:08,206
Let me go shove Gur a bit.

416
00:38:08,206 --> 00:38:10,393
So relieved.

417
00:38:13,908 --> 00:38:16,475
Now that you're out, go all the way.

418
00:38:17,393 --> 00:38:19,800
Be a role model for the kids here.

419
00:38:19,800 --> 00:38:23,500
Show them that if they play smart,
they can make it.

420
00:38:26,100 --> 00:38:31,293
Go far, so us low-born folks
can still keep dreaming.

421
00:38:33,206 --> 00:38:34,960
Good luck, man.

422
00:38:35,946 --> 00:38:37,853
Thanks a lot, boss.

423
00:39:04,846 --> 00:39:06,133
Hey.

424
00:39:15,080 --> 00:39:17,373
Wanna grab a coffee?

425
00:39:18,693 --> 00:39:20,093
Sure.

426
00:39:35,453 --> 00:39:36,920
Thanks.

427
00:40:05,726 --> 00:40:08,580
The land deal, everything go smoothly?

428
00:40:10,266 --> 00:40:16,860
Just launched the company.
And I'm now Anita's one and only rep in Thailand.

429
00:40:16,860 --> 00:40:18,386
That's awesome.

430
00:40:18,386 --> 00:40:20,753
Congrats.

431
00:40:20,753 --> 00:40:24,353
Mine's all done too. Got the first payment.

432
00:40:24,353 --> 00:40:26,440
Paid off my family's debt.

433
00:40:26,440 --> 00:40:29,240
Everyone's so happy.

434
00:40:29,240 --> 00:40:32,213
But I had to lie to my grandma
that I won the lottery.

435
00:40:48,033 --> 00:40:50,206
I'm leaving tomorrow morning.

436
00:40:51,226 --> 00:40:52,886
Super early.

437
00:40:52,886 --> 00:40:56,073
How long will you be gone?
What's the deal with Anita?

438
00:40:56,073 --> 00:40:58,853
Six months. Half a year.

439
00:40:59,846 --> 00:41:01,406
Sounds fun.

440
00:41:02,160 --> 00:41:03,653
Maybe?

441
00:41:11,380 --> 00:41:14,420
I just wanted to thank you.

442
00:41:14,420 --> 00:41:16,173
Huh?

443
00:41:16,173 --> 00:41:18,740
I'd been thinking of quitting for a while.

444
00:41:18,740 --> 00:41:21,373
But I wasn't in a rush.

445
00:41:23,080 --> 00:41:29,733
Then I saw the way you and your relatives
looked at me.

446
00:41:31,620 --> 00:41:35,053
It was like...

447
00:41:37,133 --> 00:41:39,040
like I woke up.

448
00:41:47,500 --> 00:41:52,493
When you're there,
you should really learn how Anita thinks.

449
00:41:52,493 --> 00:41:55,060
Study everything from her.

450
00:41:55,060 --> 00:41:57,593
It'll be super useful for you.

451
00:41:57,593 --> 00:42:00,506
You've got great land.

452
00:42:00,506 --> 00:42:06,593
If you have the money and the mindset,
you can come back and do so much more.

453
00:42:14,593 --> 00:42:17,786
Make your dream happen, okay?

454
00:42:17,786 --> 00:42:20,126
And I'll make mine happen too.

455
00:42:47,621 --> 00:42:49,306
Keep in touch, okay?

456
00:42:49,306 --> 00:42:50,560
Can I?

457
00:42:50,560 --> 00:42:56,573
Of course. We're friends... Right?

458
00:42:57,773 --> 00:42:59,333
Yeah.

459
00:43:02,115 --> 00:43:04,075
I like you.

460
00:43:05,433 --> 00:43:08,426
And I still want to keep liking you.

461
00:43:12,900 --> 00:43:15,133
Can I hug you?

462
00:43:38,517 --> 00:43:41,298
I like you too.

463
00:45:03,980 --> 00:45:08,286
I don't know what you like,
but this snack is really good.

464
00:45:08,286 --> 00:45:09,546
Wow.

465
00:45:09,546 --> 00:45:13,333
- Welcome to Shanghai.
- Thanks.

466
00:45:14,453 --> 00:45:18,120
I figured you'd want to eat this,
so I brought this for you.

467
00:45:18,813 --> 00:45:20,865
Thank you.

468
00:45:20,865 --> 00:45:22,205
Let's go.

469
00:45:44,793 --> 00:45:47,793
The night I first moved in here,

470
00:45:47,793 --> 00:45:50,853
I dragged a chair over
and stared at the lights all night.

471
00:45:52,940 --> 00:45:55,013
I'd probably do the same.

472
00:45:56,433 --> 00:46:01,193
I'll show you around today.
I only have one day off work.

473
00:46:02,233 --> 00:46:06,293
So you'll know where to go and how to get around.

474
00:46:06,986 --> 00:46:10,316
There's a lot to see here.

475
00:46:10,316 --> 00:46:13,629
Sightseeing, shopping. You won't get bored.

476
00:46:27,606 --> 00:46:29,853
Are you planning to use your own money?

477
00:46:33,873 --> 00:46:36,153
Why are you here?

478
00:46:37,173 --> 00:46:40,487
You came for the money, why not just say so?

479
00:46:44,326 --> 00:46:47,133
If it weren't for the 20 million,
you wouldn't be here.

480
00:46:50,973 --> 00:46:57,033
And if you had 20 million,
what would you do with it?

481
00:46:59,153 --> 00:47:04,453
If you know why you're here,
you wouldn't have made that face just now.

482
00:47:05,666 --> 00:47:08,720
I'm sorry.
It's just, this is my first time actually...

483
00:47:08,720 --> 00:47:11,857
Do you know Jimmy O. Yang?

484
00:47:11,857 --> 00:47:15,366
He's a well-known speaker and writer.

485
00:47:15,366 --> 00:47:18,140
He once gave a speech that said:

486
00:47:18,140 --> 00:47:22,653
Sometimes you have to do something you hate
to earn money,

487
00:47:22,653 --> 00:47:28,780
so you can spend it on something you love.

488
00:47:33,147 --> 00:47:36,493
You're here because I'm paying you.

489
00:47:36,493 --> 00:47:42,620
So do your job. Enjoy it, even.
If not, I'll send you home.

490
00:47:45,032 --> 00:47:46,666
Let's go.

491
00:47:46,666 --> 00:47:51,453
I'm taking you
to try the best noodles in Shanghai.

492
00:47:51,453 --> 00:47:53,953
I want to learn from you too.

493
00:47:54,904 --> 00:47:56,511
What?

494
00:47:58,020 --> 00:48:01,133
Yeah. I came here for the money...

495
00:48:02,080 --> 00:48:06,213
because I plan to go back
and start a business for my family.

496
00:48:07,100 --> 00:48:11,546
But money alone isn't enough.
I need knowledge too.

497
00:48:12,906 --> 00:48:15,393
Can I learn from you?

498
00:48:18,739 --> 00:48:22,314
My knowledge isn't free.

499
00:48:22,314 --> 00:48:26,606
And if I charged you,
you definitely couldn't afford it.

500
00:48:26,606 --> 00:48:32,033
But if you prove yourself useful,
if you show some business sense,

501
00:48:32,033 --> 00:48:35,213
then I'll tell you the things you ought to know.

502
00:49:05,813 --> 00:49:07,193
Here.

503
00:49:15,512 --> 00:49:19,840
I think Bangkok in Thailand
would be the best location.

504
00:49:19,840 --> 00:49:23,434
Because it has many natural resources,

505
00:49:23,434 --> 00:49:26,010
and is most suitable to set up a spa resort.

506
00:49:26,010 --> 00:49:28,840
I totally agree with his view.

507
00:49:28,840 --> 00:49:30,480
This place is very ideal...

508
00:49:30,480 --> 00:49:31,640
[Pinyin]

509
00:49:40,680 --> 00:49:41,680
[I'm fine, thank you]

510
00:49:42,440 --> 00:49:44,060
[Good morning]

511
00:49:44,060 --> 00:49:46,266
Zaoshang hao. (Good morning)

512
00:49:52,344 --> 00:49:55,181
- Isn't this a bit too much, huh?
- Not really.

513
00:49:55,181 --> 00:49:58,906
- This is considered a lot.
- Nope.

514
00:49:59,586 --> 00:50:04,626
Jay didn't even spend 20,000 yuan
this whole month?

515
00:50:04,626 --> 00:50:10,220
Most of that was groceries for the house.

516
00:50:10,220 --> 00:50:15,806
The biggest expense was language lessons.

517
00:50:16,666 --> 00:50:19,173
What?

518
00:50:19,173 --> 00:50:21,893
Jay's learning Chinese?

519
00:50:21,893 --> 00:50:25,653
Private tutor, four days a week.

520
00:50:43,938 --> 00:50:47,386
This is delicious. Did you make it yourself?
(In Chinese)

521
00:50:47,386 --> 00:50:50,580
Yeah, I cooked it myself.

522
00:50:50,580 --> 00:50:52,593
You understand well now.

523
00:50:52,593 --> 00:50:55,906
But still not fluent in speaking.
(In Chinese)

524
00:50:58,380 --> 00:51:01,106
You're doing great.

525
00:51:01,106 --> 00:51:07,213
If you stay all six months or even a year longer,
you'll be fluent.

526
00:51:10,680 --> 00:51:12,440
Actually, you know,

527
00:51:12,440 --> 00:51:15,833
learning a language with someone you love
is the easiest way.

528
00:51:17,793 --> 00:51:21,240
But you don't really have time, do you?

529
00:51:22,913 --> 00:51:26,860
Wait, are you saying I'm your lover or something?

530
00:51:33,060 --> 00:51:36,226
Hurry and eat
before it gets cold and loses its flavor.

531
00:52:06,886 --> 00:52:12,053
Have you ever heard the song
The Moon Represents My Heart?

532
00:52:12,053 --> 00:52:13,360
What?

533
00:52:15,533 --> 00:52:21,313
It's a famous Chinese song.
A lot of Thais know it.

534
00:52:23,254 --> 00:52:25,880
I think I've heard it.

535
00:52:25,880 --> 00:52:29,613
Why? Is it about the moon?

536
00:52:29,613 --> 00:52:31,446
Yeah.

537
00:52:31,446 --> 00:52:37,920
The lyrics go,
"If you ask me how deep my love is"...

538
00:52:40,013 --> 00:52:42,566
"It's so real."

539
00:52:44,280 --> 00:52:48,040
"The moon represents my heart."

540
00:53:01,820 --> 00:53:04,540
That kiss still lingers...

541
00:53:05,933 --> 00:53:13,093
in my memory, forever etched in my heart.

542
00:55:05,720 --> 00:55:08,206
[Car Loft]
Looks like we'll need two cars this time.

543
00:55:08,206 --> 00:55:11,066
Both clients are arriving together.

544
00:55:11,066 --> 00:55:14,193
Wow. When clients come like this, it's amazing.

545
00:55:14,193 --> 00:55:17,194
Seriously, I haven't had a break
since the start of the month.

546
00:55:17,194 --> 00:55:19,951
Haven't even had time to grab dinner with my dad.

547
00:55:19,951 --> 00:55:23,406
Then maybe you need to hire someone to help.

548
00:55:23,406 --> 00:55:26,066
Honestly, my heart is so full.

549
00:55:26,066 --> 00:55:30,256
I actually did it.
And now, my family doesn't even meddle anymore.

550
00:55:30,256 --> 00:55:31,762
Really?

551
00:55:31,762 --> 00:55:36,302
And when I get some downtime,
I'm gonna look for an office to rent.

552
00:55:37,143 --> 00:55:40,050
Anyway, I'm off.
I've got a meeting with Mr. Wasu today.

553
00:55:40,050 --> 00:55:42,683
Wait, Wasu?

554
00:55:42,683 --> 00:55:44,436
Which Wasu?

555
00:55:44,436 --> 00:55:46,753
Wasu from Land and Life?

556
00:55:46,753 --> 00:55:51,363
Yeah, he asked to meet.
Maybe we'll find a way to collaborate.

557
00:55:51,363 --> 00:55:55,116
Girl, do you know how amazing he is?

558
00:55:55,116 --> 00:55:57,876
Handsome, rich, super hot.

559
00:55:57,876 --> 00:55:59,116
Really?

560
00:55:59,116 --> 00:56:03,053
I don't think it's that much!
I'm off now. See you later.

561
00:56:04,190 --> 00:56:07,053
You're looking gorgeous, friend!

562
00:56:10,640 --> 00:56:12,423
Right this way.

563
00:56:18,976 --> 00:56:21,760
Mr. Wasu sends his apologies.
He'll be about ten minutes late.

564
00:56:21,760 --> 00:56:23,200
Please have a seat, Miss Pitcha.

565
00:56:23,200 --> 00:56:24,846
The housekeeper will bring you
some coffee shortly.

566
00:56:24,846 --> 00:56:26,773
Thank you very much.

567
00:56:54,840 --> 00:57:00,360
Which moon do you think that rabbit,
looking up like that, wants to be on?
