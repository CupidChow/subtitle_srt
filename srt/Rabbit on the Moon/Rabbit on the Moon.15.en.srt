Is Plearn okay?

5
00:01:32,750 --> 00:01:36,100
I should be asking you
whether Plearn is okay or not.

6
00:01:36,100 --> 00:01:39,127
Honestly, that day I had no idea
what was going on between you two.

7
00:01:39,127 --> 00:01:41,473

Huh?

11
00:01:59,300 --> 00:02:03,757
Plearn told me that you haven't been giving her
much time lately.

12
00:02:04,500 --> 00:02:05,980
That doesn't make any sense.

13

Someone like Dr. Plearn Nattha shouldn't have
to worry about things like that.

Not really.

15
00:02:11,042 --> 00:02:15,580
Women, if they feel neglected
by the person next to them,

16
00:02:15,580 --> 00:02:21,140
it doesn't matter what degree they hold,
no one likes it.

17
00:02:22,967 --> 00:02:28,180

18
00:02:28,180 --> 00:02:31,587
Why not try a little harder?

19
00:02:31,587 --> 00:02:34,720
Otherwise, it could cause long-term problems.

20
00:02:34,720 --> 00:02:37,933
If both of you keep trying
to adjust to each other,

21
00:02:37,933 --> 00:02:40,657
eventually it'll work out.

22
00:02:41,700 --> 00:02:45,347
Maybe I should try taking her on a honeymoon trip?

23
00:02:45,347 --> 00:02:48,440
That might be nice.

24
00:02:48,440 --> 00:02:52,547
If a woman feels like the person next to her
really cares about her issues,

25
00:02:52,547 --> 00:02:54,187
that can go a long way.

26
00:02:54,187 --> 00:02:56,102
Alright.

00:02:57,923 --> 00:03:05,693

call me directly, don't call Pitcha.

I don't want her constantly meddling
in your family matters.

29
00:03:10,287 --> 00:03:17,207
Pitcha has a talent
for stirring things off course.

30
00:03:17,207 --> 00:03:27,167

but honestly, she's way more obedient than Pitcha.

in yours and Plearn's marriage.

how hard you've been partying
and how many women you've been with lately?

36
00:03:47,173 --> 00:03:50,087
Your mom already knows everything
about my lifestyle.

Plearn knows too,

00:03:51,813 --> 00:03:55,867

I'd stop.

After that, I'll handle it.

Are you seriously trying to stop me
from getting involved with my own sister?

45
00:04:18,833 --> 00:04:23,796

involved with Plearn.

Plearn, I understand how you feel right now.

182

But you can't let people see you like this.

You're still a teacher.

You have to look further ahead,

I just want to be happy, Mom.

188
00:19:42,404 --> 00:19:46,300
There are many kinds of happiness.

189
00:19:46,300 --> 00:19:52,881
If you saw what you have now as happiness,
you already have a lot.

190
00:19:54,120 --> 00:20:00,413
The happiness I'm talking about
isn't a house, or a car, or clothes,

191
00:20:00,413 --> 00:20:04,785
or even having a husband who never respects me.

192
00:20:05,667 --> 00:20:08,387
It's something inside.

193
00:20:08,387 --> 00:20:12,260
Inside, I feel nothing but unhappiness.

194
00:20:12,260 --> 00:20:15,253
I hate myself more every day.

195
00:20:15,253 --> 00:20:18,066

- Leave Laks.
- What kind of father are you?

209
00:21:19,060 --> 00:21:21,740
How could you tell your daughter
to get a divorce like that?

210
00:21:21,740 --> 00:21:23,860
She's only been married for less than a year.

211
00:21:23,860 --> 00:21:27,413
If she ends it, she'll be the one who looks bad.

212
00:21:27,413 --> 00:21:29,940
I'm a father who wants to see his daughter happy.

213
00:21:29,940 --> 00:21:33,540
And I understand ending up with a man like this...

214
00:21:33,540 --> 00:21:37,947
She met a man like that
because of the karma you created.

215
00:21:37,947 --> 00:21:40,620
Because you cheated on me.

216

You're the one who should've left Araya.

And thank you for your advice, Dad.

about how I feel.

- Plearn...
- Excuse me.

00:34:54,180 --> 00:34:56,923
showed me this video.

344
00:35:17,220 --> 00:35:21,573
I've been trying to hide it from Grandma.

345
00:35:21,573 --> 00:35:24,868
But the neighbors keep talking.

346
00:35:27,913 --> 00:35:30,196
They're saying...

347
00:35:32,980 --> 00:35:36,423
Did you go into prostitution in Bangkok, Ji?

348
00:35:59,517 --> 00:36:02,360
It was a bar where women go to hang out, Mom.

349
00:36:03,360 --> 00:36:07,160
I was just entertaining them.
Encouraging them to drink.

350
00:36:07,160 --> 00:36:11,522
Like those beer-promotion girls at pubs,
that's all.

351
00:36:14,727 --> 00:36:19,504
But Ji, did you really do
what the villagers are saying you did?

352
00:36:27,000 --> 00:36:29,973
The reason I want to sell the land is...

353
00:36:30,893 --> 00:36:34,433
if we have money, we can move somewhere else.

354
00:36:34,433 --> 00:36:37,983
We don't have to sit here
and hear people talk about us.

355
00:36:39,733 --> 00:36:43,227
So we're running away? Is that it?

356
00:36:43,227 --> 00:36:45,374
It's not like that.

357
00:36:46,207 --> 00:36:50,120
And besides, if we're not going to do anything
with the land,

358
00:36:50,120 --> 00:36:53,392
then we might as well sell it.

359
00:36:58,280 --> 00:36:59,413
If we have money,

360
00:36:59,413 --> 00:37:04,241
no matter who we were or what we did,
people will shut up.

361
00:37:05,180 --> 00:37:07,562
I'm not ashamed of you, Ji.

362
00:37:09,207 --> 00:37:12,726
I'm just worried about you.

363
00:37:13,753 --> 00:37:19,980
If there's an easier path,
then maybe we should take it.

364
00:37:19,980 --> 00:37:22,293
So you don't have to struggle.

365
00:38:39,093 --> 00:38:41,072
Hello everyone.

366
00:38:41,887 --> 00:38:44,127
- Hi there.
- Good to see you.

367
00:38:47,031 --> 00:38:49,070
Hi.

368
00:38:49,070 --> 00:38:50,671
Hello.

369
00:38:55,467 --> 00:38:57,000
Hello everyone.

370
00:38:57,000 --> 00:38:58,700
Hi, Pitcha.

371
00:38:58,700 --> 00:39:03,047
I'd like to introduce the partners
who'll be listening to your pitch today.

372
00:39:03,047 --> 00:39:06,473
This is Mr. Boy, Ms. Asira, and Mr. Nut.

373
00:39:06,473 --> 00:39:08,817
Hello again, everyone.

374
00:39:09,440 --> 00:39:10,520
Are you ready?

375
00:39:10,520 --> 00:39:12,514
I'm ready, just a little nervous.

376
00:39:12,514 --> 00:39:16,213
This is Ms. Goi, my assistant presenter today.

377
00:39:16,213 --> 00:39:18,600
Shall we get started?

378
00:39:18,600 --> 00:39:20,283
Please go ahead.

379
00:39:22,860 --> 00:39:24,080
[Wellness Center Therapy]

380
00:39:24,080 --> 00:39:27,240
Community-based wellness,
focusing on physical and mental health,

381
00:39:27,240 --> 00:39:30,671
is trending among the younger generation.

382
00:39:47,475 --> 00:39:50,036
[Food Retreats]

383
00:39:50,940 --> 00:39:53,752
Finally, thank you all
[Thank You]

384
00:39:53,752 --> 00:39:58,200
for supporting this kind of meaningful project.

385
00:40:10,020 --> 00:40:13,993
Very informative, Pitcha.
The project is very interesting.

386
00:40:13,993 --> 00:40:15,940
There might be a few small concerns,

387
00:40:15,940 --> 00:40:19,169
so I'm sure there'll be some questions
from everyone.

388
00:40:19,860 --> 00:40:23,100
Let me move on to the next section.

389
00:40:23,100 --> 00:40:27,127
I'd like to invite our special advisor
for this project.

390
00:40:27,127 --> 00:40:28,870
Please welcome...

391
00:41:03,993 --> 00:41:07,807
Hello, Ms. Pitcha.

392
00:41:16,920 --> 00:41:23,327
This is Ms. Anita, a renowned expert
in land investment and real estate.

393
00:41:23,327 --> 00:41:25,219
Please sit down.

394
00:41:29,233 --> 00:41:31,818
- Hello.
- Hello.

395
00:41:39,315 --> 00:41:41,623
I'd like a word.

396
00:41:43,968 --> 00:41:46,685
I can wait. Go ahead.

397
00:41:57,493 --> 00:42:00,353
You never told me about Anita.

398
00:42:00,353 --> 00:42:03,320
True, but does it really matter?

399
00:42:03,320 --> 00:42:05,700
Whether I told you or not,
whether she's here or not,

400
00:42:05,700 --> 00:42:07,920
you'd have to pitch this project anyway.

401
00:42:07,920 --> 00:42:10,820
And honestly, having her here to help
patch the gaps in the proposal

402
00:42:10,820 --> 00:42:12,920
might actually benefit you.

403
00:42:12,920 --> 00:42:15,580
She already owns land, and she's an investor.

404
00:42:15,580 --> 00:42:17,449
What if she learns everything
and goes off to do it herself?

405
00:42:17,449 --> 00:42:22,107
Come on, she's got a name in this industry.
She wouldn't do that.

406
00:42:22,107 --> 00:42:26,247
Plus, I've got an entire board
who can confirm that this is your project.

407
00:42:26,247 --> 00:42:28,313
It's not that complicated.

408
00:42:28,313 --> 00:42:32,273
If it's not complicated,
then why didn't you tell me she'd be here?

409
00:42:32,273 --> 00:42:34,860
Why did you let her Zoom in from another room?

410
00:42:34,860 --> 00:42:39,457
If there's nothing suspicious,
why didn't she just join like everyone else?

411
00:42:40,761 --> 00:42:44,267
You had me pitch the project in front of her
without telling me.

412
00:42:44,267 --> 00:42:47,761
You let her listen to my full presentation first.

413
00:42:48,813 --> 00:42:51,277
You really are an asshole.

414
00:42:57,860 --> 00:43:01,240
Alright, sorry for the wait.

415
00:43:01,240 --> 00:43:05,084
I just had to check a few things with Mr. Wasu.

416
00:43:10,933 --> 00:43:18,393
Now, Ms. Anita,
please feel free to comment on my project.

417
00:43:18,393 --> 00:43:22,368
Let me just record this in case I miss anything.

418
00:43:25,493 --> 00:43:27,393
It's a good project.

419
00:43:27,393 --> 00:43:30,927
Wellness is a rising trend globally.

420
00:43:30,927 --> 00:43:36,380
In Bali, there are similar projects
that earn high returns every year.

421
00:43:36,380 --> 00:43:40,433
There's nothing wrong, except...

422
00:43:40,433 --> 00:43:44,264
The land you proposed? Not worth it.

423
00:43:45,100 --> 00:43:51,936
It's only a few rai, requires a high investment,
and you can't sustain long-term gains from it.

424
00:43:52,793 --> 00:43:58,280
Honestly, Pitcha has access to
far more promising land.

425
00:43:58,280 --> 00:44:00,717
The one she haven't shown you yet.

426
00:44:01,960 --> 00:44:07,069
The land that only Wasu and I know about.

427
00:44:12,113 --> 00:44:15,006
What exactly did you two agree on?

428
00:44:15,749 --> 00:44:19,127
My friends in China mention you often.

429
00:44:19,127 --> 00:44:22,014
They say you're a very promising newcomer.

430
00:44:22,746 --> 00:44:27,077
If you're saying that,
then I'll take it as a compliment.

431
00:44:28,680 --> 00:44:31,393
Let's get to the point.

432
00:44:31,393 --> 00:44:34,967
I heard you're developing a new project
with Pitcha.

433
00:44:34,967 --> 00:44:38,447
Sorry, I can't remember the name of her company.

434
00:44:38,447 --> 00:44:42,373
I just want to know do you already
have a primary investor for this project,

435
00:44:42,373 --> 00:44:45,347
or are you still open to partners?

436
00:44:45,347 --> 00:44:51,207
Because my friends and I are interested
in both your company and Pitcha's idea.

437
00:44:51,207 --> 00:44:54,171
She and I have worked together before.

438
00:44:54,827 --> 00:44:58,163
We'd definitely welcome a partner like you.

439
00:44:58,960 --> 00:45:02,400
Great. In that case...

440
00:45:02,400 --> 00:45:06,440
Let me share my investment conditions first.

441
00:45:06,440 --> 00:45:09,716
Of course, please go ahead.

442
00:45:11,403 --> 00:45:17,583
I want final decision-making power
over this project.

443
00:45:19,987 --> 00:45:22,940
And I want the land in Nan.

444
00:45:26,207 --> 00:45:28,779
The one you know exactly where it is.

445
00:45:32,033 --> 00:45:35,896
You're pressuring me
to hand over Jira's land to you.

446
00:45:36,933 --> 00:45:39,180
The return is enormous.

447
00:45:39,180 --> 00:45:43,500
Before you answer, go run the numbers.
