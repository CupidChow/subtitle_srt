[Jira]

2
00:01:24,600 --> 00:01:26,160
Hello.

3
00:01:26,160 --> 00:01:30,521
Hello, where are you? I'm coming to see you.

4
00:01:31,224 --> 00:01:33,790
I'm with Anita right now.

5
00:01:33,790 --> 00:01:35,520
Could you wait for me in the room?

6
00:01:35,520 --> 00:01:38,190
I'll come as soon as I'm done.
It won't take long.

7
00:01:38,920 --> 00:01:43,687
I know where you are. Wait there, I'm coming.

8
00:01:56,729 --> 00:01:58,663
Who was that?

9
00:02:00,583 --> 00:02:05,030
So about my offer, are you interested?

10
00:02:06,383 --> 00:02:11,010
Is this purely business?
Or is there something personal mixed in?

11
00:02:11,840 --> 00:02:14,280
What do you think?

12
00:02:17,800 --> 00:02:23,600
Anita, I thought I'd already been clear
about my feelings.

13
00:02:23,600 --> 00:02:26,377
I could change your life, you know.

14
00:02:27,230 --> 00:02:33,830
My offer could make you the owner
of your own business on your own land.

15
00:02:33,830 --> 00:02:39,083
I can make your dream come true.
I could give you everything.

16
00:02:42,743 --> 00:02:45,157
I understand.

17
00:02:45,157 --> 00:02:48,830
But I'd rather everything
came from my own efforts than...

18
00:02:48,830 --> 00:02:52,590
Only fools reject connections.

19
00:02:52,590 --> 00:02:56,990
Okay, then maybe I'm a fool. But I'm clear, Anita.

20
00:02:57,970 --> 00:03:03,350
I really appreciate everything you've offered me.

21
00:03:04,459 --> 00:03:07,626
But I don't feel comfortable accepting it.

22
00:03:10,863 --> 00:03:13,470
I still want to be friends.

23
00:03:13,470 --> 00:03:16,390
But if you can't be friends with me, then I...

24
00:03:21,616 --> 00:03:24,669
You're really full of yourself, you know that?

25
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:34,890
Do you think someone like me
would keep begging you like this forever?

26
00:03:36,050 --> 00:03:43,840
Do you know how many guys in your line of work
are younger, hotter, and more charming than you?

27
00:03:43,840 --> 00:03:47,443
And do you know just how much better they are
at pleasing me than you are?

28
00:03:47,443 --> 00:03:50,997
Truth is, I don't need to be asking you like this
at all.

29
00:03:53,337 --> 00:03:56,450
Listen carefully.

30
00:03:56,450 --> 00:04:00,717
When I invest in something, it's never small.

31
00:04:00,717 --> 00:04:04,590
Annual billing has to be in the billions.

32
00:04:04,590 --> 00:04:09,190
That kind of money could be in your life.

33
00:04:20,099 --> 00:04:26,392
These days, money is harder to find
than true love.

34
00:04:52,257 --> 00:04:56,343
Anita, sorry to interrupt.

35
00:04:56,343 --> 00:05:00,337
I have something important he needs to hear.

36
00:05:00,337 --> 00:05:02,601
It won't take long.

37
00:05:03,501 --> 00:05:07,817
Sit down. Let's talk right here.

38
00:05:08,737 --> 00:05:12,663
If it's something important about Jay,
I'd like to hear it too.

39
00:05:12,663 --> 00:05:14,417
Anita.

40
00:05:15,723 --> 00:05:18,650
It's okay. I'll sit here.

41
00:05:37,163 --> 00:05:42,057
Today, I told my family
that I want to be with you.

42
00:05:44,703 --> 00:05:50,790
I've been unclear because I was so afraid
of how others would see me.

43
00:05:53,360 --> 00:05:56,960
That day when you told me

44
00:05:56,960 --> 00:06:03,640
that what I lacked was the presence
that made others accept my choices,

45
00:06:03,640 --> 00:06:06,480
I get it now.

46
00:06:06,480 --> 00:06:09,320
I get it so deeply it unlocked something in me.

47
00:06:09,320 --> 00:06:14,400
I know I can't become you overnight.

48
00:06:14,400 --> 00:06:17,940
But starting today...

49
00:06:20,520 --> 00:06:23,480
I'll build myself up until I have everything.

50
00:06:24,920 --> 00:06:28,687
So much so that no one would dare criticize
what I choose.

51
00:06:36,425 --> 00:06:41,598
If you still want to walk with me, then follow me.

52
00:06:44,360 --> 00:06:46,920
I won't take any more of your time.

53
00:07:09,760 --> 00:07:11,720
Anita...

54
00:07:13,360 --> 00:07:16,566
Thank you for everything.

55
00:07:19,960 --> 00:07:26,893
I'll always be your best friend, if you'll let me.

56
00:09:22,520 --> 00:09:26,160
Why are you trailing behind like that?

57
00:09:26,160 --> 00:09:30,760
You told me to follow,
but you didn't say to walk together.

58
00:09:31,620 --> 00:09:34,607
Then come on, walk next to me.

59
00:10:14,947 --> 00:10:18,094
Your place or mine?

60
00:10:19,053 --> 00:10:20,833
Want to go to the beach?

61
00:10:20,833 --> 00:10:24,053
Sure. Hand me the keys.

62
00:10:25,153 --> 00:10:27,340
Go ahead.

63
00:13:19,987 --> 00:13:23,760
About Pitcha, I'll try to talk to her.

64
00:13:23,760 --> 00:13:25,160
That's good.

65
00:13:25,160 --> 00:13:28,527
You understand each other better
than I ever could.

66
00:13:28,527 --> 00:13:32,114
I've said all I have to say.

67
00:13:32,114 --> 00:13:35,947
Just don't lose all sense of decency.

68
00:13:35,947 --> 00:13:38,600
And don't tell me
she's going to be with someone like him.

69
00:13:51,811 --> 00:13:54,664
I thought Laks would be coming with you today.

70
00:13:58,414 --> 00:14:01,000
He's busy, as always, Mom.

71
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:03,547
He's out partying
with different groups of friends.

72
00:14:03,547 --> 00:14:06,327
He's hardly home these days.

73
00:14:07,094 --> 00:14:10,167
Is that why you changed your hairstyle?

74
00:14:13,214 --> 00:14:15,075
Plearn.

75
00:14:15,075 --> 00:14:18,018
You're a teacher.

76
00:14:18,018 --> 00:14:20,647
You can't just do whatever you feel like.

77
00:14:20,647 --> 00:14:25,247
You've got students all over the place.

78
00:14:26,180 --> 00:14:28,287
Yes, Mom.

79
00:14:30,267 --> 00:14:33,674
Marriage isn't easy.

80
00:14:34,607 --> 00:14:38,240
Many couples go through tough times
to make it work.

81
00:14:38,240 --> 00:14:41,787
You'll never know what they had to endure.

82
00:14:43,400 --> 00:14:49,207
The sacrifices, the patience, the compromises.

83
00:14:50,240 --> 00:14:53,960
Sometimes giving in to things
they didn't even want to.

84
00:14:53,960 --> 00:15:01,040
But if the goal is to keep the family together,
you have to learn to adjust.

85
00:15:05,240 --> 00:15:07,800
Would anyone like more tea?

86
00:15:10,120 --> 00:15:13,600
But he barely pays any attention to me, Mom.

87
00:15:13,600 --> 00:15:16,753
He's hardly home. Doesn't say where he's going.

88
00:15:16,753 --> 00:15:18,773
When he's back,
it's just for a moment before he leaves again.

89
00:15:18,773 --> 00:15:22,013
Some weeks, I barely even see his face.

90
00:15:22,013 --> 00:15:25,480
Have you talked to him directly
about how it's too much?

91
00:15:25,480 --> 00:15:30,953
Men like things said straight,
not hints or sarcasm.

92
00:15:31,726 --> 00:15:33,340
I have.

93
00:15:33,340 --> 00:15:35,800
Many times, Dad.

94
00:15:35,800 --> 00:15:40,360
The parties are full of women.
The out-of-town outings, only women.

95
00:15:40,360 --> 00:15:43,887
I don't even know who they all are...

96
00:15:44,953 --> 00:15:47,786
but I know there must be someone.

97
00:15:50,840 --> 00:15:53,694
What do you think I should do, Mom and Dad?

98
00:15:53,694 --> 00:15:55,360
Let me say this...

99
00:15:55,360 --> 00:16:00,840
But I've known since before you got married
that Laks likes to go out.

100
00:16:00,840 --> 00:16:05,600
- I knew too, but I didn't think...
- No one's perfect.

101
00:16:05,600 --> 00:16:09,440
Some good, some bad.

102
00:16:09,440 --> 00:16:14,874
If you weigh it all up,
I think Laks has more good than bad.

103
00:16:16,080 --> 00:16:18,360
Stay strong for now, Plearn.

104
00:16:18,360 --> 00:16:22,440
I'll find the right time to talk to him.

105
00:16:22,440 --> 00:16:28,273
And you, talk to Pitcha. I'll handle Plearn.

106
00:16:36,640 --> 00:16:39,013
These snacks are really good.

107
00:19:01,193 --> 00:19:04,220
<i>Plearn, I've called so many times
and you didn't pick up.</i>

108
00:19:04,220 --> 00:19:07,273
<i>How are you? Are you okay?</i>

109
00:19:09,280 --> 00:19:10,600
[Plearn, I've called so many times
and you didn't pick up.]

110
00:19:10,600 --> 00:19:11,920
[How are you? Are you okay?]

111
00:19:16,313 --> 00:19:18,993
<i>Want to come to the beach?</i>

112
00:19:23,540 --> 00:19:25,793
<i>Who are you with?</i>

113
00:19:34,746 --> 00:19:36,653
<i>Jira.</i>

114
00:19:41,567 --> 00:19:43,880
<i>That guy?</i>

115
00:19:43,880 --> 00:19:47,300
<i>Cha, I'll be honest.</i>

116
00:19:47,300 --> 00:19:51,806
<i>If you want to casually date this guy, fine.
I won't stop you.</i>

117
00:19:51,806 --> 00:19:54,360
<i>But don't bring him into the family.</i>

118
00:19:54,360 --> 00:20:00,273
<i>Don't think of introducing him as your boyfriend.
Absolutely not.</i>

119
00:20:01,113 --> 00:20:05,280
<i>Don't post pictures.
Don't leave any proof that you were ever with him.</i>

120
00:20:05,280 --> 00:20:07,233
<i>Trust me.</i>

121
00:20:11,080 --> 00:20:15,673
<i>You can date him for fun, but don't get serious.</i>

122
00:20:15,673 --> 00:20:21,313
<i>Remember, we have to hold our heads high
when choosing the man who'll be with us.</i>

123
00:20:34,240 --> 00:20:37,600
<i>Like how you chose Laks?</i>

124
00:21:23,653 --> 00:21:28,680
How far do you think we'll get, you and me?

125
00:21:28,680 --> 00:21:34,920
Far, as far as we can go.

126
00:21:34,920 --> 00:21:36,793
And you?

127
00:21:36,793 --> 00:21:39,286
I want that too.

128
00:21:39,286 --> 00:21:42,713
But honestly, we don't really know.

129
00:21:45,106 --> 00:21:48,179
I get it.

130
00:21:51,640 --> 00:21:55,153
One day, we might not love each other anymore.

131
00:21:55,153 --> 00:21:58,413
You might meet someone new. Or I might.

132
00:21:58,413 --> 00:22:01,506
Or maybe we're just not right
for each other after all.

133
00:22:01,506 --> 00:22:03,513
What is this?

134
00:22:06,480 --> 00:22:10,353
But if we ever have to break up,

135
00:22:10,353 --> 00:22:13,633
let's do it for the usual reasons
people fall out of love.

136
00:22:15,252 --> 00:22:16,859
Fair enough.

137
00:22:21,300 --> 00:22:24,993
Or maybe your mom won't like me.

138
00:22:24,993 --> 00:22:28,633
Funny. Your mom doesn't like me either.

139
00:22:35,969 --> 00:22:42,262
But if this really isn't meant to be,
we have to be honest with each other, okay?

140
00:22:43,918 --> 00:22:45,885
Okay.

141
00:22:49,840 --> 00:22:52,074
Come here.

142
00:23:02,646 --> 00:23:07,593
But in the meantime, let's give it our best.

143
00:23:08,633 --> 00:23:11,160
Of course.

144
00:24:44,480 --> 00:24:47,440
[Wasu_WS replied to your story]

145
00:25:13,080 --> 00:25:14,480
[Dad]

146
00:25:20,320 --> 00:25:22,106
Yes, Dad?

147
00:25:22,106 --> 00:25:23,666
Where are you?

148
00:25:24,267 --> 00:25:25,566
I'm on a trip.

149
00:25:25,566 --> 00:25:28,083
Where, exactly?

150
00:25:29,145 --> 00:25:31,300
Is something wrong?

151
00:25:31,300 --> 00:25:34,686
I want to talk about the man
you said you're dating.

152
00:25:36,880 --> 00:25:40,436
<i>I don't think you should be so public about it.
It's inappropriate.</i>

153
00:25:40,436 --> 00:25:44,560
If people find out,

154
00:25:44,560 --> 00:25:49,460
your mom's relatives are even stricter
than she is.

155
00:25:49,460 --> 00:25:51,800
Do you love...

156
00:25:52,960 --> 00:25:55,840
that woman?

157
00:25:55,840 --> 00:25:57,640
<i>If you do,</i>

158
00:25:57,640 --> 00:26:03,973
but you keep her hidden like you've been doing,
how do you think she'd feel?

159
00:26:03,973 --> 00:26:05,867
This isn't the same.

160
00:26:05,867 --> 00:26:08,586
<i>You're right, Dad. It's not.</i>

161
00:26:08,586 --> 00:26:13,107
I'm not someone who already has a family
and is secretly seeing someone else.

162
00:26:13,107 --> 00:26:18,040
I can be open. I can tell anyone.

163
00:26:18,040 --> 00:26:22,574
Don't use your lifestyle
as a guide for how I should live mine.

164
00:26:22,574 --> 00:26:26,360
<i>I just don't want you to get hurt
if one day it doesn't work out.</i>

165
00:26:26,360 --> 00:26:30,847
You might forget, but others won't.

166
00:26:30,847 --> 00:26:34,387
<i>They'll always remember you for that.</i>

167
00:26:34,387 --> 00:26:39,527
When you get back, come see me.
I really want to talk.

168
00:26:54,454 --> 00:26:58,127
- This is just the beginning, right?
- Yeah.

169
00:27:01,467 --> 00:27:07,027
Plew, I get what your dad was saying.

170
00:27:07,027 --> 00:27:11,687
So do I. But I didn't do anything wrong.

171
00:27:11,687 --> 00:27:16,174
I didn't break the law. I didn't hurt anyone.

172
00:27:16,174 --> 00:27:19,780
And I'm not trying to challenge anyone.

173
00:27:19,780 --> 00:27:26,527
I just want to tell myself and tell you
that I've made my choice.

174
00:27:58,674 --> 00:28:00,120
Jack.

175
00:28:00,120 --> 00:28:04,427
Come to Thailand immediately.
I've got something for you to do.

176
00:28:15,320 --> 00:28:17,753
Hero-style shirt, huh?

177
00:28:18,566 --> 00:28:20,400
Hey.

178
00:28:20,400 --> 00:28:23,320
Did you see Ji's IG story last night?

179
00:28:23,320 --> 00:28:24,960
What story?

180
00:28:24,960 --> 00:28:27,706
You're behind again.

181
00:28:27,706 --> 00:28:29,153
Here, I'll show you.

182
00:28:29,153 --> 00:28:30,893
- Where?
- Look at this.

183
00:28:31,713 --> 00:28:34,120
- See?
- That's Pitcha.

184
00:28:34,120 --> 00:28:37,640
Exactly. Look at his serious face! Ji, huh?

185
00:28:37,640 --> 00:28:39,880
Doesn't he usually not let people tag him?

186
00:28:39,880 --> 00:28:41,700
That's what I thought too.

187
00:28:42,960 --> 00:28:46,160
Look at his eyes, look at that face. See that?

188
00:28:46,160 --> 00:28:48,560
Whoa, that sly little smile! Look at his eyes.

189
00:28:48,560 --> 00:28:54,320
- Look at those puppy eyes.
- I think they've got something going on.

190
00:28:54,320 --> 00:28:58,453
Pitcha looked worried, like she cared,
when she went after Ji.

191
00:28:58,453 --> 00:29:02,226
Like she hasn't decided what she really wants yet.

192
00:29:03,160 --> 00:29:06,047
Whether to date him or not?

193
00:29:06,047 --> 00:29:12,240
Maybe. But I don't think she's serious.
Her parents are filthy rich.

194
00:29:12,240 --> 00:29:17,007
And her older sister? Super high and mighty.
Scary. I'm scared of her.

195
00:29:19,880 --> 00:29:24,240
Her sister's husband used to be your client,
right?

196
00:29:24,240 --> 00:29:25,463
Yeah.

197
00:29:27,793 --> 00:29:31,753
What kind of service was it back then?

198
00:29:34,715 --> 00:29:37,420
Drinking companion.

199
00:29:37,420 --> 00:29:40,060
He said I was easy to talk to, not fussy.

200
00:29:40,060 --> 00:29:43,914
As for the sleepover kind... that rotated.

201
00:29:43,914 --> 00:29:45,200
Hey.

202
00:29:45,200 --> 00:29:48,820
I'm free today.
Want me to help move the clothes pile?

203
00:29:48,820 --> 00:29:51,587
No need. Just help carry it downstairs.

204
00:29:51,587 --> 00:29:54,574
The van will pick it up.
There'll be helpers there when I arrive.

205
00:29:55,427 --> 00:29:57,680
In that case...

206
00:29:57,680 --> 00:30:01,880
Should we take a picture together for IG stories?

207
00:30:01,880 --> 00:30:03,800
- Come on.
- Why? No.

208
00:30:03,800 --> 00:30:08,400
Why not? I just want to keep a memory.

209
00:30:08,400 --> 00:30:10,947
My face looks good when I'm working.

210
00:30:10,947 --> 00:30:12,600
No thanks, no pictures.

211
00:30:12,600 --> 00:30:15,407
- Just one, come on! Come here!
- Nope, nope, not doing it.

212
00:30:15,407 --> 00:30:16,994
I'm out.

213
00:30:16,994 --> 00:30:19,994
- Grab the rack and follow me.
- What the...

214
00:30:24,560 --> 00:30:26,773
You hear me?

215
00:30:27,640 --> 00:30:29,600
- Gur!
- Whoa, chill, chill.

216
00:30:29,600 --> 00:30:33,892
That's the kind of butt
that'll be the mother of my child.

217
00:30:40,920 --> 00:30:43,200
[Mr. Wasu]

218
00:30:47,400 --> 00:30:49,040
[Mr. Wasu]

219
00:30:50,405 --> 00:30:52,120
Yes, Mr. Wasu?

220
00:30:53,114 --> 00:30:56,131
Sure, when would you like me to come in?

221
00:30:56,131 --> 00:31:00,800
Today's fine, but it'll have to be in the evening.

222
00:31:00,800 --> 00:31:02,754
Ah, okay.

223
00:31:02,754 --> 00:31:05,520
I'll be in Bangkok around early afternoon.

224
00:31:05,520 --> 00:31:07,767
Yes, I stopped by the beach.

225
00:31:07,767 --> 00:31:10,247
Alright, see you later this evening.

226
00:31:16,240 --> 00:31:19,780
- Are you hungry?
- A little.

227
00:31:19,780 --> 00:31:22,080
What do you feel like eating?

228
00:31:23,211 --> 00:31:26,413
Let's head inside first.
I need to get ready for a meeting.

229
00:31:26,413 --> 00:31:29,493
I have a project discussion this evening.

230
00:31:29,493 --> 00:31:31,580
What project is it?

231
00:31:31,580 --> 00:31:35,053
It's a community concept I'm proposing.

232
00:31:35,828 --> 00:31:39,926
A community for the younger generation,
and I'm doing it with Mr. Wasu.

233
00:31:41,669 --> 00:31:43,540
How so?

234
00:31:43,540 --> 00:31:47,793
I have a few rare plots of land.

235
00:31:47,793 --> 00:31:51,246
If he's interested,

236
00:31:51,246 --> 00:31:55,580
I'd be the intermediary
between the project and the landowners.

237
00:32:22,381 --> 00:32:25,779
Once I finish the project discussion,
I'll call you tonight.

238
00:32:25,779 --> 00:32:27,854
Sure. Hey.

239
00:32:27,854 --> 00:32:32,180
What's in it for you,
being the middle person like that?

240
00:32:32,180 --> 00:32:33,967
What do you mean?

241
00:32:33,967 --> 00:32:36,720
I mean your project with Mr. Wasu.

242
00:32:36,720 --> 00:32:39,240
If he could just deal directly
with the landowners,

243
00:32:39,240 --> 00:32:40,834
why would he need you?

244
00:32:40,834 --> 00:32:44,460
Because I have contracts
with two or three of those landowners.

245
00:32:44,460 --> 00:32:47,740
The agreement is for me
to find high-potential projects for their land.

246
00:32:47,740 --> 00:32:50,187
They set the conditions.

247
00:32:50,187 --> 00:32:53,440
You have to understand
that these people aren't desperate for cash.

248
00:32:53,440 --> 00:32:54,800
They're not eager to sell.

249
00:32:54,800 --> 00:32:58,807
They just want their land
to become valuable assets over time.

250
00:32:58,807 --> 00:33:01,280
Hey, your land could be used for this too.

251
00:33:01,280 --> 00:33:07,267
Yeah, I was just thinking about that.
I think Anita mentioned something similar.

252
00:33:08,107 --> 00:33:12,547
- Talk more later. I need to prep for my work now.
- Okay, sure.

253
00:33:26,747 --> 00:33:28,847
Additional one.

254
00:33:28,847 --> 00:33:30,727
Take care.

255
00:33:30,727 --> 00:33:32,167
Okay.

256
00:33:32,167 --> 00:33:35,247
- I'll text you soon.
- Alright.

257
00:33:45,920 --> 00:33:50,947
At first, there was a lot of interest,
but there are still many details to discuss.

258
00:33:50,947 --> 00:33:54,320
It'll take time, and even then, nothing's certain.

259
00:33:54,320 --> 00:33:58,907
I understand. But I'm ready if you are.

260
00:34:01,800 --> 00:34:05,920
How sure are you
that the landowners are fully on board with you?

261
00:34:05,920 --> 00:34:07,800
I've signed agreements with them.

262
00:34:07,800 --> 00:34:12,287
Anyone who wants to view the land
must get their permission first.

263
00:34:12,287 --> 00:34:15,180
Any big-name developers you worked with before
get to see this land?

264
00:34:15,180 --> 00:34:21,140
No, because the most important condition is,
they won't sell to foreigners.

265
00:34:23,347 --> 00:34:25,227
Alright.

266
00:34:31,100 --> 00:34:32,527
This way, please.

267
00:34:35,577 --> 00:34:38,040
So, where should we continue our discussion?

268
00:34:38,040 --> 00:34:39,360
Huh?

269
00:34:39,360 --> 00:34:42,527
About the project, the partnership,
and the presentation,

270
00:34:42,527 --> 00:34:45,027
we need to work on it together.

271
00:34:46,857 --> 00:34:50,607
Wouldn't it be better
if we prepared separately and shared ideas later?

272
00:34:50,607 --> 00:34:54,193
I've never co-led a project before.
It's a bit nerve-wracking.

273
00:34:54,193 --> 00:34:57,367
Then let's just talk casually,
brainstorm as we go.

274
00:34:57,367 --> 00:35:00,920
I'll bring in my partner too.
I want you to meet her.

275
00:35:00,920 --> 00:35:03,420
She's got great ideas.

276
00:35:03,420 --> 00:35:05,074
Whose car should we take?

277
00:35:05,886 --> 00:35:09,774
Let's just drive separately,
in case I leave earlier.

278
00:35:09,774 --> 00:35:13,850
I just got back from the provinces
and I'm really tired.

279
00:35:14,514 --> 00:35:16,887
That person in the story looks familiar.

280
00:35:18,307 --> 00:35:21,607
Is he your friend, the one we met in Nan?

281
00:35:21,607 --> 00:35:23,734
Oh, yes.

282
00:35:23,734 --> 00:35:27,327
He's one of the landowners
you're doing a deal with, right?

283
00:35:30,460 --> 00:35:35,520
If it's the land in Nan, then I get it.
I think it's worth investing in the long-term.

284
00:35:35,520 --> 00:35:37,687
If you can seal a deal with him,

285
00:35:37,687 --> 00:35:40,600
I believe the project in Nan
will take off quickly.

286
00:35:40,600 --> 00:35:42,547
There's no competition.

287
00:35:43,460 --> 00:35:46,740
So, where should we go talk next?

288
00:35:47,520 --> 00:35:50,680
Just follow me in your car, then.

289
00:35:50,680 --> 00:35:52,247
This way.

290
00:36:24,600 --> 00:36:27,840
[Plew]

291
00:36:29,960 --> 00:36:32,800
[Plew]

292
00:37:00,727 --> 00:37:02,880
- Yeah?
- <i>Hello, Gur?</i>

293
00:37:02,880 --> 00:37:06,307
How do we even know...

294
00:37:09,300 --> 00:37:11,487
Know what?

295
00:37:11,487 --> 00:37:14,487
Like, know for sure that we're officially dating?

296
00:37:14,487 --> 00:37:21,201
Do people still need to say it?
Like you and I are now officially a couple?

297
00:37:21,201 --> 00:37:23,374
<i>Is that still a thing?</i>

298
00:37:23,374 --> 00:37:27,467
Yeah, I never thought about that either.

299
00:37:27,467 --> 00:37:33,240
But wait, hang on. I saw your IG story.

300
00:37:33,240 --> 00:37:35,600
You and that girl...

301
00:37:35,600 --> 00:37:39,587
The one who came to the bar,
are you two together now?

302
00:37:39,587 --> 00:37:42,327
Yeah, we are.

303
00:37:42,327 --> 00:37:46,727
But I'm not sure
how much I can act like we're official.

304
00:37:46,727 --> 00:37:50,040
Like, what I can or can't show. You get me?

305
00:37:50,040 --> 00:37:51,200
You confused?

306
00:37:51,200 --> 00:37:53,749
No, no, I get it.

307
00:37:53,749 --> 00:37:58,947
This morning,
Maprang didn't let me come to the shoot either.

308
00:38:01,534 --> 00:38:04,760
Maybe she still doesn't want
to tell anyone she's dating me.

309
00:38:04,760 --> 00:38:08,234
Or maybe she doesn't want to go public yet?

310
00:38:08,234 --> 00:38:11,294
Or maybe she's just got her own thoughts?

311
00:38:11,294 --> 00:38:15,240
Hey, I think this is a real issue.

312
00:38:15,240 --> 00:38:18,607
Right? So what should we do?

313
00:38:19,380 --> 00:38:21,880
Let's meet at the Isaan BBQ place.
I'm craving raw spicy beef salad.

314
00:38:21,880 --> 00:38:24,409
I'll invite Bew too.

315
00:38:24,409 --> 00:38:27,034
Cool. See you there.

316
00:38:27,034 --> 00:38:28,867
See you.

317
00:38:34,800 --> 00:38:37,560
You two are unbelievable.

318
00:38:37,560 --> 00:38:42,067
Worrying about how to define your relationship.

319
00:38:42,067 --> 00:38:44,240
Seriously?

320
00:38:44,240 --> 00:38:48,680
The way you act in the bar? So smooth.

321
00:38:48,680 --> 00:38:51,307
That's work, man. Not real life.

322
00:38:51,307 --> 00:38:54,347
Exactly. It's just part of the job.
Totally different.

323
00:38:54,347 --> 00:38:57,280
Come on, it's pretty much the same.

324
00:38:57,280 --> 00:39:00,867
You guys are seriously confused, huh?

325
00:39:01,587 --> 00:39:03,347
- Totally.
- Totally

326
00:39:05,047 --> 00:39:10,080
You see, at the bar, it feels like a relationship,

327
00:39:10,080 --> 00:39:15,540
but in real life,
being in a relationship is something else.

328
00:39:15,540 --> 00:39:22,567
Like me, just typing,
"Hey, did you get home safe?"

329
00:39:22,567 --> 00:39:26,260
I keep typing and deleting it.

330
00:39:26,260 --> 00:39:27,320
Same here.

331
00:39:27,320 --> 00:39:31,067
When she's on set, I just want to ask,
"How did you get home? Who dropped you off?"

332
00:39:31,067 --> 00:39:33,827
It's not even about how she got home,

333
00:39:33,827 --> 00:39:35,120
- it's who dropped her off that's the real issue.
- It's who dropped her off that's the real issue.

334
00:39:35,120 --> 00:39:38,742
- Exactly. So hard to ask.
- Wait.

335
00:39:38,742 --> 00:39:40,394
You mean Maprang?

336
00:39:40,394 --> 00:39:42,227
Yeah.

337
00:39:43,744 --> 00:39:46,431
And you? Who are you talking about?

338
00:39:47,847 --> 00:39:49,640
Plew.

339
00:39:49,640 --> 00:39:51,487
Plew?

340
00:39:51,487 --> 00:39:53,240
Which Plew?

341
00:39:53,240 --> 00:39:56,047
The girl he brought to meet that Chinese client.

342
00:39:59,047 --> 00:40:05,294
So, she's a land broker.

343
00:40:05,294 --> 00:40:06,960
We met before.

344
00:40:06,960 --> 00:40:13,020
Back then, neither of us knew what the other did.

345
00:40:13,020 --> 00:40:15,260
But we clicked. Do you get it?

346
00:40:15,260 --> 00:40:17,247
Like, seriously clicked.

347
00:40:17,247 --> 00:40:23,607
So we said we'd meet up for coffee
once I was back.

348
00:40:23,607 --> 00:40:25,640
But before we could even set a date,

349
00:40:25,640 --> 00:40:30,674
she contacted the host agency
to assign me to her client who was viewing land.

350
00:40:30,674 --> 00:40:34,627
- Boom, everything crashed.
- Totally.

351
00:40:34,627 --> 00:40:39,234
When we saw each other again,
man, I knew it was over.

352
00:40:39,234 --> 00:40:42,774
She was shocked, I was even more shocked.

353
00:40:42,774 --> 00:40:46,907
So I thought, okay, let's just end it.

354
00:40:46,907 --> 00:40:49,494
But her client specifically asked for me.

355
00:40:49,494 --> 00:40:53,987
So she had no choice but to contact me.

356
00:40:53,987 --> 00:40:57,107
Her client booked me for ten full days.

357
00:40:57,107 --> 00:41:00,320
- Oh, that time.
- Yeah.

358
00:41:00,320 --> 00:41:02,840
So it's like, you get it?

359
00:41:02,840 --> 00:41:07,160
And the more I saw her, the more it felt right.

360
00:41:07,160 --> 00:41:10,147
It kept flipping. Yes, no, yes, no.

361
00:41:10,147 --> 00:41:13,680
Until I thought I had to stop.

362
00:41:13,680 --> 00:41:18,427
Then she came after me.

363
00:41:20,920 --> 00:41:26,167
Now it seems like she's ready to go public
about being with me.

364
00:41:26,167 --> 00:41:27,880
And then her dad called.

365
00:41:27,880 --> 00:41:31,200
So now I don't know what's gonna happen.
Can we make it?

366
00:41:37,767 --> 00:41:40,199
Hey, check this out.

367
00:41:41,090 --> 00:41:42,640
With a post like this,

368
00:41:42,640 --> 00:41:45,620
I don't even know
if I have the right to be jealous.

369
00:41:45,620 --> 00:41:47,907
Do I have that right?

370
00:41:47,907 --> 00:41:53,020
You know our job, we can't afford to get jealous.

371
00:41:53,926 --> 00:41:55,053
Whatever.

372
00:41:55,053 --> 00:41:57,580
- Come on, cheers!
- Cheers!

373
00:42:04,627 --> 00:42:08,640
Hey, I'm heading home. I'm really sleepy.

374
00:42:08,640 --> 00:42:11,663
Want me to drive you? I'll Grab back after.

375
00:42:11,663 --> 00:42:15,200
Oh no, it's fine. I didn't drink that much.

376
00:42:15,200 --> 00:42:17,960
I'm totally sober. See?

377
00:42:22,555 --> 00:42:24,228
See?

378
00:42:27,867 --> 00:42:29,787
I want to drive you.

379
00:42:31,513 --> 00:42:34,580
Thanks so much, but really, it's okay.

380
00:42:34,580 --> 00:42:37,687
Today's ideas were great, by the way.
Really interesting stuff.

381
00:42:37,687 --> 00:42:42,627
I'll reflect on it a bit
and send you a summary soon.

382
00:42:43,400 --> 00:42:44,980
Sure.

383
00:43:30,200 --> 00:43:32,120
Hey.

384
00:43:32,120 --> 00:43:33,920
What are you doing here?

385
00:43:33,920 --> 00:43:38,787
You posted a story at a bar.
I saw it and got a bit worried.

386
00:43:39,647 --> 00:43:45,893
I barely drank.
I went with Mr. Wasu's creative team.

387
00:43:46,627 --> 00:43:49,093
So how's the project going?

388
00:43:49,093 --> 00:43:52,860
Seems promising.
But there's still a lot to talk about.

389
00:43:58,284 --> 00:44:01,250
Shouldn't you go to sleep? It's late.

390
00:44:04,273 --> 00:44:06,260
Bye-bye.

391
00:44:09,073 --> 00:44:11,014
Hey.

392
00:44:17,400 --> 00:44:20,204
Thanks for waiting.

393
00:44:20,960 --> 00:44:23,240
Good night.

394
00:44:23,240 --> 00:44:24,760
Good night.

with Wasu Land & Life.

Tonight, go to Smile Bar
and dig up more info on Jay.

00:45:20,720 --> 00:45:22,927
Like what, exactly?

402
00:45:24,300 --> 00:45:28,120
Everything.

403
00:45:28,120 --> 00:45:30,673
I want to know it all.

Excuse me.

407
00:46:02,320 --> 00:46:04,200
Hello.

408
00:46:04,200 --> 00:46:06,200
Hello. Hello.

Hello.
(In Chinese)

410
00:46:09,000 --> 00:46:13,260
I heard there's a star named Jay here?

411
00:46:13,260 --> 00:46:15,400
Oh, he's left the business already.

412
00:46:15,400 --> 00:46:19,733
But I've got someone new.

413
00:46:19,733 --> 00:46:24,000
He's personally trained by Jay himself.

414
00:46:24,000 --> 00:46:26,900
You'll feel like he's right there with you.

415
00:46:27,927 --> 00:46:30,480
Let me see first.

416
00:46:30,480 --> 00:46:33,554
Of course. I'll take you to the room.

417
00:46:33,554 --> 00:46:36,560
And I'll send over our hottest boy.

418
00:46:36,560 --> 00:46:40,053
Super cute, charming, boy-next-door type.

419
00:46:40,053 --> 00:46:42,200
Sim.

420
00:46:42,200 --> 00:46:43,926
Yes?

421
00:46:43,926 --> 00:46:45,733
Bring Bew.

422
00:46:45,733 --> 00:46:48,333
Whoa, you picked Bew?

423
00:46:48,333 --> 00:46:50,193
Good choice.

424
00:46:50,193 --> 00:46:52,360
Come, I'll take you to the table.

425
00:46:52,360 --> 00:46:54,886
- Please, this way.
- This way.

426
00:47:04,680 --> 00:47:06,487
I'm Bew.

427
00:47:07,127 --> 00:47:09,400
Nice to meet you.

428
00:47:16,593 --> 00:47:19,200
First time here?

429
00:47:21,333 --> 00:47:23,680
Do you speak Thai?

430
00:47:24,647 --> 00:47:28,780
Yes. I've studied Thai and can read too.

431
00:47:28,780 --> 00:47:32,667
I come to Thailand often,
but it's my first time here.

432
00:47:33,616 --> 00:47:36,076
Welcome.

433
00:47:36,076 --> 00:47:41,152
Now that you're here,
I won't let you go anywhere else.

434
00:47:41,152 --> 00:47:44,713
Let me mix you a special drink.

435
00:47:47,871 --> 00:47:50,340
Had a long day?

436
00:47:50,340 --> 00:47:52,720
A bit.

437
00:47:52,720 --> 00:47:57,413
Don't worry, I'll take care of you all night.

438
00:48:01,525 --> 00:48:04,745
You'll love this special mix.

439
00:48:24,702 --> 00:48:28,808
Did Jay teach you this cocktail recipe?

440
00:48:29,926 --> 00:48:33,526
Jay's like my mentor.

441
00:48:37,733 --> 00:48:39,433
Cheers!

442
00:48:40,974 --> 00:48:44,320
Thailand!

443
00:48:51,104 --> 00:48:57,251
I heard Jay left the scene
to be with a Chinese businesswoman?

444
00:48:58,087 --> 00:49:00,087
That's not true.

445
00:49:00,087 --> 00:49:02,993
It is! That's what I heard.

446
00:49:02,993 --> 00:49:05,720
Believe me, that's not what happened.

447
00:49:11,667 --> 00:49:13,727
Then tell me.

448
00:49:18,473 --> 00:49:21,080
I'll pay for info.

449
00:49:21,893 --> 00:49:26,053
If you want a bigger payout, better spill it fast.

450
00:49:28,727 --> 00:49:30,293
Okay...

451
00:49:30,953 --> 00:49:35,866
So Jay met a woman. And...

452
00:49:46,780 --> 00:49:53,055
What I've learned is,
he met Pitcha by chance on an island.

453
00:49:53,055 --> 00:50:00,173
They clicked right away,
but neither knew what the other did for work.

454
00:50:00,173 --> 00:50:08,040
Later, they bumped into each other again,
and that's when Pitcha found out Jay was a host.

455
00:50:08,040 --> 00:50:17,800
After Pitcha started working on a deal for you,
they began talking and eventually started dating.

456
00:50:17,800 --> 00:50:22,520
Now they've gone public with it.

457
00:50:22,520 --> 00:50:25,000
They're officially a couple.

458
00:50:52,280 --> 00:50:58,547
Do you think Jay came to me just to help Pitcha?

459
00:50:59,760 --> 00:51:06,080
Do you think he came to be close to her?

460
00:51:06,080 --> 00:51:07,720
Ann, please don't...

461
00:51:07,720 --> 00:51:13,373
When he was with me,
was he thinking about that woman the whole time?

462
00:51:50,444 --> 00:51:51,990
Ann...

463
00:52:35,673 --> 00:52:37,327
This way, please.

464
00:52:55,609 --> 00:52:59,609
Glad we finally got to meet, Miss Anita.
