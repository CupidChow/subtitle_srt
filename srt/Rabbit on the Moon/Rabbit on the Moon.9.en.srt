00:01:10,840 --> 00:01:12,646
I'm Wasu.

2
00:01:12,646 --> 00:01:14,910
Oh, hello.

3
00:01:14,910 --> 00:01:16,623
I'm Pitcha.

4
00:01:16,623 --> 00:01:18,430
Please, have a seat.

5
00:01:23,810 --> 00:01:26,177
Do you like this painting?

6
00:01:26,177 --> 00:01:28,637
I like Kookkie's work.

7
00:01:28,637 --> 00:01:30,250
He's a friend of mine.

8
00:01:30,250 --> 00:01:31,963
Really?

9
00:01:31,963 --> 00:01:34,653
Normally, I collect art for investment.

10
00:01:34,653 --> 00:01:37,470
I choose up-and-coming artists
whom I think will trend.

11
00:01:37,470 --> 00:01:40,463
Once they get popular, I sell.

12
00:01:40,463 --> 00:01:43,970
If you ever decide to let go of this piece,
let me know.

13
00:01:43,970 --> 00:01:45,790
This one's hard to part with.

14
00:01:45,790 --> 00:01:50,177
I really like Kook's work.

15
00:01:50,177 --> 00:01:52,309
It's approachable.

16
00:01:52,309 --> 00:01:55,963
You don't have to twist your brain
to interpret it.

17
00:01:55,963 --> 00:01:58,257
I don't have that much time to overthink.

18
00:01:59,763 --> 00:02:03,829
You still haven't answered,
which moon would you choose?

19
00:02:06,559 --> 00:02:10,737
I like the one with the rabbit.

20
00:02:10,737 --> 00:02:16,600
But I don't think
rabbits get to choose which moon to live on.

21
00:02:16,600 --> 00:02:18,777
How about you?

22
00:02:18,777 --> 00:02:24,137
All I know is it probably wouldn't
want to fight for space with other rabbits.

23
00:02:26,713 --> 00:02:30,150
Anyway, shall we talk business?

24
00:02:30,150 --> 00:02:32,063
Almost forgot!

25
00:02:32,063 --> 00:02:37,403
So, I've got several projects in the pipeline.

26
00:02:37,403 --> 00:02:43,070
And I'm in need of land.
I noticed you've got quite a bit.

27
00:02:46,330 --> 00:02:49,230
I've raised capital
for five-to six-star resorts before,

28
00:02:49,230 --> 00:02:51,850
both from international and local investors.

29
00:02:51,850 --> 00:02:58,083
If a site is really prime, high-quality,
I pitch it to partner with major hotel chains.

30
00:02:58,083 --> 00:03:03,154
I recall your selling point is
the organic angle, chemical-free,

31
00:03:03,154 --> 00:03:06,483
or landowners who promote sustainability.

32
00:03:06,483 --> 00:03:11,063
I think it's interesting.
Could be shaped into an eco-resort concept.

33
00:03:11,063 --> 00:03:14,863
Exactly, I've been looking for someone
who gets this for a while.

34
00:03:14,863 --> 00:03:19,723
Besides you, there's also a Chinese investor
who sees it as a strong selling point.

35
00:03:19,723 --> 00:03:22,240
That's great. I'd love to meet them.

36
00:03:22,240 --> 00:03:25,397
I like working with like-minded people.
It makes things easier.

37
00:03:25,397 --> 00:03:27,950
Would you be interested in joining me?

38
00:03:27,950 --> 00:03:31,503
You could co-own,
or simply show me your land options.

39
00:03:31,503 --> 00:03:32,720
I'm interested.

40
00:03:32,720 --> 00:03:34,560
But let me be clear,

41
00:03:34,560 --> 00:03:37,077
the trees, water sources, and communities
must not be harmed.

42
00:03:37,077 --> 00:03:41,051
That's what will make
the concept feel real and compelling.

43
00:03:41,051 --> 00:03:42,790
Understood.

44
00:03:49,097 --> 00:03:51,930
Give me a week.

45
00:03:51,930 --> 00:03:53,837
I'll send you the land details.

46
00:03:53,837 --> 00:03:56,670
If you're interested in any,
we can schedule a meeting.

47
00:03:56,670 --> 00:04:00,723
Sounds good.
I'll have my team draft a joint investment model.

48
00:04:00,723 --> 00:04:01,903
And if there's a chance,

49
00:04:01,903 --> 00:04:06,150
I'd love for you to invite that Chinese investor
for a casual chat.

50
00:04:06,150 --> 00:04:08,210
Maybe we can collaborate on something fun.

51
00:04:08,210 --> 00:04:12,098
Alright, if I get the chance,
I'll speak with them.

52
00:04:12,098 --> 00:04:13,750

Is he gay?

55
00:05:22,760 --> 00:05:27,317
From what my radar's picking up,
I'd say probably not?

I'm not sure.

57

A friend of a friend of a friend
is obsessed with him.

58
00:05:33,263 --> 00:05:37,450
Says he's the kind of guy who makes you
look fabulous just by being next to him.

59
00:05:37,450 --> 00:05:45,570
Well, yeah. He dresses well, seems laid-back,
not pretentious, not too much, not cringe.

60
00:05:45,570 --> 00:05:47,777
And you're not swooning over him?

61

have a girlfriend.

62

He's the full package.

63
00:05:52,863 --> 00:05:57,983
If I ever run into him,
I'll ask for your friend's friend's friend.

64
00:05:58,883 --> 00:06:01,457
You seem a lot more at ease now.

65
00:06:01,457 --> 00:06:05,643
Yeah. Mom and Plearn have backed off a lot.

66
00:06:05,643 --> 00:06:07,331
I can do whatever I want for work.

67

but it's way more chill than before.

All thanks to Anita, right?
That's how you got out of it.

69

Well, Jay too.

and he still agreed to go.

Three months, I think.

"babe", "honey" already, huh?

00:14:51,117 --> 00:14:53,630
What's up, troublemaker?

177
00:14:53,630 --> 00:14:56,383
Wanted to ask if you're free for some good food.

178
00:14:56,383 --> 00:14:58,163
Or do you have plans with Laks?

179
00:14:58,783 --> 00:15:02,137
He went out of town for work with his family
for a few days.

180
00:15:02,790 --> 00:15:06,934
Since we got married,
we haven't even had time for a honeymoon.

181
00:15:06,934 --> 00:15:10,830
My schedule's open, but his isn't.

182
00:15:10,830 --> 00:15:12,670
So boring.

183
00:15:12,670 --> 00:15:16,430
Then let's go eat together. No more being lonely.
What do you want to eat?

184
00:15:19,762 --> 00:15:21,410
I want to go to a Spanish bar.

185
00:15:21,410 --> 00:15:23,057
Huh?

186
00:15:23,057 --> 00:15:24,363
Come with me.

187
00:15:24,363 --> 00:15:27,043
I've been meaning to invite you.

188
00:15:27,043 --> 00:15:29,710
There's this hidden bar under a hotel.

189
00:15:29,710 --> 00:15:32,743
<i>It's really chic,
but not many people know about it.</i>

190
00:15:32,743 --> 00:15:38,622
But I want to try it. I'll send you the location.
Let's meet there.

191
00:15:38,622 --> 00:15:41,263
- Okay, sounds good.
- Okay, bye.

192
00:15:45,990 --> 00:15:50,037
This place has such a nice vibe, Plearn.
How did you know about it?

193
00:15:50,037 --> 00:15:53,550
They have private rooms too.
People say they're beautiful.

194
00:16:02,096 --> 00:16:04,356
- Excuse me.
- Yes?

195
00:16:05,857 --> 00:16:08,823
Is that private room booked today?

196
00:16:08,823 --> 00:16:11,703
Yes, it's reserved.

197
00:16:13,143 --> 00:16:14,643
Can I get a menu, please?

198
00:16:14,643 --> 00:16:16,137
Here you go.

199
00:16:17,170 --> 00:16:20,737
- Also, could you bring over a wine list?
- Of course.

200
00:16:29,430 --> 00:16:31,863
Do you want to sit in that room, Plearn?

201
00:16:32,630 --> 00:16:37,643
I just want to see who gets to be in there.

202
00:17:02,875 --> 00:17:04,670
<i>Your wife is at this restaurant.</i>

203
00:17:04,670 --> 00:17:08,817
Let's go, there's more.

204
00:17:12,637 --> 00:17:14,610
- I'm just going to the restroom.
- I will go with you.

205
00:17:14,610 --> 00:17:16,230
No need.

206
00:17:19,172 --> 00:17:22,932
You stay and order food for me. Watch the table.

207
00:17:29,570 --> 00:17:33,870
Great. What are the odds?
Or does Plearn know something?

208
00:17:36,958 --> 00:17:38,765
Wait!

209
00:17:41,457 --> 00:17:42,683
Yes?

210
00:17:49,090 --> 00:17:52,550
I'm Plearn Nattha Jarulaks.

211
00:17:53,894 --> 00:17:55,870
Hello.

212
00:17:55,870 --> 00:17:59,523
We met at the pre-wedding shoot.

213
00:17:59,523 --> 00:18:02,030
I coordinated for the team.

214
00:18:03,150 --> 00:18:05,210
Would you like to use the restroom?

215
00:18:05,210 --> 00:18:06,908
You first, please.

216
00:18:06,908 --> 00:18:08,477
Wait!

217
00:18:17,335 --> 00:18:20,148
Laks! Plearn is outside.

218
00:18:21,590 --> 00:18:24,270
You go out with my husband a lot.

219
00:18:25,220 --> 00:18:26,704
Please calm down.

220
00:18:26,704 --> 00:18:29,283
No one stays calm in situations like this.

221
00:18:29,283 --> 00:18:31,677
Stay away from my husband.

222
00:18:31,677 --> 00:18:35,392
- It's just a job.
- Whore.

223
00:18:35,392 --> 00:18:38,150
It's just a dinner meeting.

224
00:18:38,150 --> 00:18:40,157
Whore.

225
00:18:42,217 --> 00:18:44,630
Please stop calling me that.

226
00:18:45,450 --> 00:18:50,503
Whatever name you give yourself,
it won't make you any less low.

227
00:18:52,197 --> 00:18:54,770
Stay away from my husband!

228
00:19:15,597 --> 00:19:17,303
Cha.

229
00:19:17,303 --> 00:19:22,179
Sorry, I suddenly got a migraine.
Do you mind if I go home first?

230
00:19:22,179 --> 00:19:24,870
Sure, but I already ordered food.

231
00:19:24,870 --> 00:19:27,143
- I think...
- You wait for the food then.

232
00:19:27,143 --> 00:19:29,897
I'm heading off. Sorry.

233
00:19:33,817 --> 00:19:36,583
Did you know before Plearn,
or did she find out herself?

234
00:19:36,583 --> 00:19:38,992
Is this really the time for that kind of question?

235
00:19:38,992 --> 00:19:42,728
Maybe you should leave for now.
I'm afraid she will barge into the room.

236
00:19:45,690 --> 00:19:48,343
Cha, you don't need to worry.

237
00:19:48,343 --> 00:19:50,223
Plearn wouldn't do something like that.

238
00:19:50,223 --> 00:19:54,143
- What is this? Are you really not going to...
- Come here. Thank you for worrying.

239
00:19:54,143 --> 00:19:57,150
I'm really okay. Totally fine.

240
00:20:00,930 --> 00:20:03,383
So Plearn knew all along?

241
00:20:19,609 --> 00:20:20,957
<i>Yes, Plearn?</i>

242
00:20:20,957 --> 00:20:23,217
Come home so we can talk.

243
00:20:23,217 --> 00:20:24,343
<i>Plearn!</i>

244
00:20:24,343 --> 00:20:27,470
Come home. I'll be waiting.

245
00:21:00,977 --> 00:21:03,230
I'm Plearn's younger sister.

246
00:21:04,050 --> 00:21:05,690
I know.

247
00:21:07,363 --> 00:21:12,510
If it's not too much to ask,
could you stop taking jobs from my brother-in-law?

248
00:21:14,710 --> 00:21:18,157
I understand.
Even if I don't take them, someone else will.

249
00:21:18,157 --> 00:21:24,650
My brother-in-law probably won't stop,
but at the very least, I'd rather it not be you.

250
00:21:26,133 --> 00:21:30,700
Laks is like my monthly salary.

251
00:21:31,457 --> 00:21:33,943
If I stop, how am I supposed to eat?

252
00:21:36,159 --> 00:21:37,943
Do you love him?

253
00:21:37,943 --> 00:21:39,577
No!

254
00:21:42,401 --> 00:21:45,223
I understand, you're working.

255
00:21:45,223 --> 00:21:47,823
I get that it's an honest profession.

256
00:21:48,577 --> 00:21:53,503
But right now, you're starting to look like
a mistress in people's eyes.

257
00:21:58,790 --> 00:22:04,560
Let me say this,
whether it helps you feel better or not.

258
00:22:04,560 --> 00:22:07,257
I'm just his companion.

259
00:22:07,257 --> 00:22:10,430
For anything else, Laks uses someone else.

260
00:22:11,550 --> 00:22:15,737
As for being a mistress,
maybe he'll have one if he finds someone he likes,

261
00:22:15,737 --> 00:22:18,157
but it's not me.

262
00:22:22,377 --> 00:22:25,223
Tell your sister this for me...

263
00:22:25,223 --> 00:22:26,863
Good luck.

264
00:23:01,378 --> 00:23:03,697
So are we going
to keep staring at each other like this, Plearn?

265
00:23:03,697 --> 00:23:06,637
I waited for you for four hours, you know?

266
00:23:06,637 --> 00:23:09,197
Well, you said you'd wait.

267
00:23:10,337 --> 00:23:12,563
Who is that girl?

268
00:23:13,657 --> 00:23:16,790
You really brought her to a pre-wedding shoot?

269
00:23:17,430 --> 00:23:19,790
You think I'd really do something like that,
Plearn?

270
00:23:19,790 --> 00:23:22,317
She had her own job there.

271
00:23:22,317 --> 00:23:25,030
You arranged everything. I didn't know a thing.

272
00:23:25,030 --> 00:23:27,903
And I had no idea she was going to be there.

273
00:23:27,903 --> 00:23:31,670
Is she an escort? Or a sugar baby?

274
00:23:35,717 --> 00:23:40,090
Please don't make me answer that, Plearn.
If I do, you'll just be even more upset.

275
00:23:41,538 --> 00:23:43,183
How did you turn into this kind of man?

276
00:23:43,183 --> 00:23:46,030
I've been like this for a long time, Plearn.

277
00:23:46,030 --> 00:23:49,017
I've never hidden it. I told you everything.

278
00:23:49,017 --> 00:23:53,283
And I told you even if I got married,
it wouldn't change anything about me.

279
00:23:53,283 --> 00:23:55,323
I already told you.

280
00:23:58,243 --> 00:24:01,943
Partying is not cheating, Plearn.

281
00:24:01,943 --> 00:24:04,150
It's just my lifestyle.

282
00:24:05,403 --> 00:24:07,950
Then why did you marry me?

283
00:24:09,538 --> 00:24:14,550
Because you pushed for it.
You said you could accept it.

284
00:24:14,550 --> 00:24:17,443
Marriage was your idea, Plearn.

285
00:24:17,443 --> 00:24:19,370
Laks!

286
00:24:20,297 --> 00:24:23,750
Don't raise your voice at me. We had an agreement.

287
00:24:24,457 --> 00:24:26,830
And don't ever do this again.

288
00:24:27,797 --> 00:24:32,083
Don't come to places
you know are my personal space.

289
00:24:38,097 --> 00:24:42,723
I love you, Plearn.
If I didn't, I wouldn't have married you.

290
00:24:44,250 --> 00:24:48,290
I won't have a mistress, there's no need.

291
00:24:48,290 --> 00:24:54,923
As long as I can keep living like this,
in a few years, I won't be able to party anymore.

292
00:24:54,923 --> 00:24:57,497
You just go shopping and wait for me, Plearn.

293
00:25:59,343 --> 00:26:01,263
Surprise!

294
00:26:05,943 --> 00:26:11,070
I snuck out and bought this yesterday,
while I made you stand and wait.

295
00:26:12,040 --> 00:26:14,273
The one that's very long?

296
00:26:15,392 --> 00:26:16,852
Yeah.

297
00:26:19,110 --> 00:26:20,710
Sorry.

298
00:26:22,790 --> 00:26:24,950
But normally, I don't accept things like this.

299
00:26:24,950 --> 00:26:28,563
You're not going to open it? It was expensive.

300
00:26:28,563 --> 00:26:32,583
No. If I see it, I might want to keep it.

301
00:26:32,583 --> 00:26:35,290
And next time,
don't spoil yourself like this again.

302
00:26:35,290 --> 00:26:37,523
- Are you talking about me?
- Yeah.

303
00:26:37,523 --> 00:26:39,750
Don't ever do that again.

304
00:26:40,623 --> 00:26:42,523
I'm done.

305
00:26:45,010 --> 00:26:46,530
I'm going for a run.

306
00:27:09,074 --> 00:27:10,920
<i>Good morning, Boss.</i>

307
00:27:10,920 --> 00:27:16,040
<i>You have a meeting this afternoon,
and don't forget to confirm the UK site visit.</i>

308
00:27:16,040 --> 00:27:17,663
Jack.

309
00:27:17,663 --> 00:27:19,090
<i>Yes?</i>

310
00:27:20,203 --> 00:27:22,450
I think I'm...

311
00:27:22,450 --> 00:27:23,877
<i>Yes?</i>

312
00:27:23,877 --> 00:27:26,263
I'm...

313
00:27:26,263 --> 00:27:27,723
<i>What do you need?</i>

314
00:27:27,723 --> 00:27:29,652
Stay away from my sister!

315
00:27:29,652 --> 00:27:31,017
I'll call you back.

316
00:27:31,017 --> 00:27:32,303
Wait.

317
00:27:32,303 --> 00:27:34,030
Go. Just go!

318
00:27:34,030 --> 00:27:36,417
Don't come here trying to scam my sister.

319
00:27:36,417 --> 00:27:37,677
Go!

320
00:27:37,677 --> 00:27:38,817
Stop.

321
00:27:38,817 --> 00:27:39,950
Stop right now.

322
00:27:39,950 --> 00:27:42,417
What are you doing, Chen?

323
00:27:42,417 --> 00:27:45,550
With Mom and the younger siblings,
you're stingy with everything.

324
00:27:45,550 --> 00:27:47,280
To get anything, we have to bow and beg.

325
00:27:47,280 --> 00:27:51,783
But with him?
You take him out, dine and travel with him?

326
00:27:51,783 --> 00:27:54,717
I saw it all.

327
00:27:54,717 --> 00:27:56,683
You were spying on me?

328
00:27:59,160 --> 00:28:01,160
Yes!

329
00:28:01,160 --> 00:28:07,160
And I'm telling Mom that you're stupid

330
00:28:07,160 --> 00:28:10,163
and falling for some Thai guy
who's just after your money.

331
00:28:10,163 --> 00:28:15,437
It's my money. I can give it to whoever I love.

332
00:28:15,437 --> 00:28:20,650
So smart with the whole world
and yet so stupid for just one man.

333
00:28:46,797 --> 00:28:48,590
That's your brother?

334
00:28:50,097 --> 00:28:53,510
Chen, my younger brother.

335
00:28:53,510 --> 00:28:57,070
He should have turned out better,
but he never finishes anything.

336
00:28:57,843 --> 00:28:59,470
Mom loves him.

337
00:29:07,163 --> 00:29:09,163
The other two siblings keep their distance.

338
00:29:09,163 --> 00:29:11,110
They get it more.

339
00:29:14,083 --> 00:29:17,037
Why don't you try seeing your mom, just once?

340
00:29:17,037 --> 00:29:20,510
What for? She doesn't care about me.

341
00:29:21,510 --> 00:29:25,370
Everyone only wants money.

342
00:29:25,370 --> 00:29:28,790
They kicked me out
because they're scared I'll run out of it.

343
00:29:32,319 --> 00:29:36,390
Maybe they really care about you.

344
00:29:36,390 --> 00:29:39,537
I know my brother's nature very well.

345
00:29:39,537 --> 00:29:42,737
Go wherever you want. I want to be alone.

346
00:29:42,737 --> 00:29:44,270
Anita.

347
00:30:11,503 --> 00:30:12,723
What is it, Maprang?

348
00:30:12,723 --> 00:30:14,050
<i>Can we talk?</i>

349
00:30:14,050 --> 00:30:16,150
<i>Yesterday, I ran into Pitcha.</i>

350
00:30:16,150 --> 00:30:17,390
Where?

351
00:30:17,390 --> 00:30:21,377
<i>She and her sister came to catch her husband
while he was with me.</i>

352
00:30:21,377 --> 00:30:22,670
Huh?

353
00:31:05,297 --> 00:31:06,990
What's up, Cha?

354
00:31:08,123 --> 00:31:12,994
Just calling to ask, how's your migraine? Better?

355
00:31:13,838 --> 00:31:16,263
One night's sleep and it was gone.

356
00:31:16,263 --> 00:31:19,023
I think it was the perfume yesterday
that gave me a headache.

357
00:31:19,023 --> 00:31:20,830
<i>Next time, I'll make it up to you.</i>

358
00:31:20,830 --> 00:31:25,443
I'll bring Mom and we'll go out for a nice meal.
On me.

359
00:31:25,443 --> 00:31:30,043
Okay. And has Laks come back from his trip?

360
00:31:30,043 --> 00:31:35,030
Yeah, he said there was nothing much there
so he came back.

361
00:31:35,723 --> 00:31:37,870
He misses me, I can tell.

362
00:31:40,080 --> 00:31:44,040
Let's plan to meet soon, Plearn. Bye.

363
00:32:10,497 --> 00:32:14,390
Wait, where are you taking that painting?

364
00:32:15,290 --> 00:32:17,457
I got a new one.

365
00:32:17,457 --> 00:32:20,643
Oh, and where's that one going?

366
00:32:20,643 --> 00:32:22,643
Home.

367
00:32:23,448 --> 00:32:26,390
Okay. Feel free.

368
00:32:31,370 --> 00:32:35,283
If you want to see it again,
you can come to my place.

369
00:32:36,590 --> 00:32:40,490
I've got a small private gallery,
lots of good pieces.

370
00:32:40,490 --> 00:32:43,310
Free entry. Coffee included.

371
00:32:43,310 --> 00:32:49,043
I've heard about it,
but didn't know you allowed visits.

372
00:32:49,043 --> 00:32:51,037
Not for everyone.

373
00:32:51,037 --> 00:32:53,743
Only for those who share...

374
00:32:53,743 --> 00:32:55,510
the same taste.

375
00:32:58,570 --> 00:33:01,003
Alright. Let's talk about work.

376
00:33:01,003 --> 00:33:03,510
I saw the land listings you sent me.

377
00:33:03,510 --> 00:33:07,177
But... I didn't like them.

378
00:33:07,177 --> 00:33:09,870
Except for the photos from August 3rd.

379
00:33:10,943 --> 00:33:12,243
Sorry?

380
00:33:12,243 --> 00:33:14,210
On your Instagram.

381
00:33:27,097 --> 00:33:28,817
In Nan?

382
00:33:28,817 --> 00:33:30,270
Nan.

383
00:33:31,590 --> 00:33:33,583
The owner's not selling.

384
00:33:33,583 --> 00:33:36,157
So you've been there already.

385
00:33:36,157 --> 00:33:38,270
Yes. He won't sell.

386
00:33:39,070 --> 00:33:41,410
Nothing in this world isn't for sale.

387
00:33:41,410 --> 00:33:44,897
We just have to figure out what it's worth.

388
00:33:46,343 --> 00:33:49,890
Please don't pursue that plot of land.

389
00:33:49,890 --> 00:33:52,362
I'll find you a new one.

390
00:33:52,362 --> 00:33:53,960
You've been in this business a long time.

391
00:33:53,960 --> 00:33:58,230
You must know
that land like that isn't easy to come by.

392
00:33:59,590 --> 00:34:02,090
Why don't you take a look
at the ones I've prepared first?

393
00:34:02,090 --> 00:34:06,190
If none of them interest you,
then we can talk about Nan.

394
00:34:11,550 --> 00:34:13,720
This one's in Phichit.

395
00:34:13,720 --> 00:34:18,000
It's really nice with great atmosphere,
very peaceful.

396
00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:20,257
The locals are super friendly too.

397
00:34:20,257 --> 00:34:23,883
I've actually been there several times already.

398
00:34:24,523 --> 00:34:28,303
Here, this one even has a river.

399
00:34:28,303 --> 00:34:30,850
How about we take a trip to Nan together?

400
00:34:30,850 --> 00:34:34,337
I'll have my secretary book the flights and hotel.

401
00:34:34,337 --> 00:34:38,403
Nan and Sukhothai,
those two places are my favorites.

402
00:34:39,430 --> 00:34:42,117
You know, you've got the same taste as my friend.

403
00:34:42,117 --> 00:34:45,457
Who? The one you mentioned before?

404
00:34:45,457 --> 00:34:51,203
Yes. Anita is very skilled at land acquisitions.

405
00:34:51,203 --> 00:34:54,277
Loves the same kind of places as you.

406
00:34:54,277 --> 00:34:59,030
If she's not a potential partner,
she'd be the competitor I'd be most afraid of.

407
00:35:00,030 --> 00:35:02,450
Let's go ahead and find a time to visit Nan.

408
00:35:02,450 --> 00:35:04,483
You just let me know, I'm ready.

409
00:35:04,483 --> 00:35:06,570
Can we stop by Sukhothai too?

410
00:35:09,910 --> 00:35:13,697
Of course.
I know this trip like the back of my hand.

411
00:35:38,410 --> 00:35:42,923
Boss, I'm here to finalize the UK trip.

412
00:35:45,121 --> 00:35:46,657
How many days?

413
00:35:46,657 --> 00:35:51,970
Well, if you want to go all out, seven nights.

414
00:35:51,970 --> 00:35:55,163
But if you want to take it easy, ten days.

415
00:35:57,168 --> 00:35:59,670
Then book the hotel for two weeks.

416
00:35:59,670 --> 00:36:01,403
I want to relax.

417
00:36:01,403 --> 00:36:03,577
Got it, two people, right?

418
00:36:03,577 --> 00:36:05,457
No.

419
00:36:05,457 --> 00:36:07,510
Just me.

420
00:36:08,495 --> 00:36:10,075
Got it.

421
00:36:11,491 --> 00:36:16,343
Also, book Jay the earliest flight
back to Thailand.

422
00:36:18,984 --> 00:36:21,357
Is everything alright?

423
00:36:22,537 --> 00:36:24,130
Nothing.

424
00:36:24,870 --> 00:36:30,191
Just tell Jay I've got an important engagement,
so I can't go with him.

425
00:36:30,191 --> 00:36:32,510
He's to return to Thailand ahead of me.

426
00:36:34,276 --> 00:36:35,721
Noted on that.

427
00:36:50,483 --> 00:36:53,217
<i>Anita will be in the UK for ten days.</i>

428
00:36:53,217 --> 00:36:56,477
<i>She thought you'd be bored,
so she's sending you home first.</i>

429
00:37:13,690 --> 00:37:15,270
See you guys.

430
00:37:16,017 --> 00:37:17,623
Safe travels.

431
00:37:17,623 --> 00:37:19,077
No detours, alright?

432
00:37:19,077 --> 00:37:21,377
Hey, where are you going tonight?

433
00:37:21,377 --> 00:37:23,330
Back to the condo.

434
00:37:23,330 --> 00:37:26,950
Drinking every night like this,
I'm gonna crash, man.

435
00:37:26,950 --> 00:37:30,157
Yeah, but what are you supposed to do?
Turn down the money?

436
00:37:30,157 --> 00:37:32,790
Exactly.

437
00:37:35,185 --> 00:37:38,165
Yo, bro, Maprang's here.

438
00:37:47,959 --> 00:37:49,372
Maprang.

439
00:38:02,223 --> 00:38:05,870
Maprang, what happened?

440
00:38:13,957 --> 00:38:16,463
Ran into some nasty clients, huh?

441
00:38:40,810 --> 00:38:44,143
The words "whore" and "mistress"
just keep echoing in my head.

442
00:38:45,143 --> 00:38:47,903
I knew this kind of thing would happen one day.

443
00:38:47,903 --> 00:38:52,343
But when it actually does, it's not okay.

444
00:38:52,343 --> 00:38:54,683
Forget the whore part, that's just noise.

445
00:38:55,517 --> 00:38:57,703
But mistress, that hits different.

446
00:38:59,437 --> 00:39:02,750
I'm not a saint or anything,

447
00:39:02,750 --> 00:39:08,537
but put yourself in her shoes,
everyone guards what's theirs.

448
00:39:10,230 --> 00:39:12,957
We're just out here trying to make a living.

449
00:39:12,957 --> 00:39:16,080
It's not right,

450
00:39:16,080 --> 00:39:18,343
but it doesn't have to be worse
than it already is.

451
00:39:22,550 --> 00:39:28,230
If you want peace of mind,
only take clients who aren't married.

452
00:39:29,157 --> 00:39:31,070
We can choose.

453
00:39:52,193 --> 00:39:54,213
You thinking of quitting?

454
00:39:57,883 --> 00:40:00,383
Who isn't?

455
00:40:00,383 --> 00:40:03,003
But first I'd need to cut my expenses.

456
00:40:03,803 --> 00:40:09,230
Rent, transportation, and my sister's tuition.

457
00:40:14,466 --> 00:40:16,433
Wanna come live with me?

458
00:40:16,433 --> 00:40:18,110
Huh?

459
00:40:28,887 --> 00:40:32,337
Wait, you two are moving in with them?

460
00:40:34,021 --> 00:40:35,511
Let's go.

461
00:41:14,810 --> 00:41:16,287
Hey.

462
00:41:18,290 --> 00:41:20,350
I meant what I said just now.

463
00:41:24,050 --> 00:41:25,540
Yeah.

464
00:41:42,467 --> 00:41:45,577
I think renting a van was a good call,
comes with a driver too.

465
00:41:45,577 --> 00:41:47,630
Driving ourselves would be exhausting.

466
00:41:47,630 --> 00:41:49,680
I actually like driving through the countryside.

467
00:41:49,680 --> 00:41:51,310
Feels nice.

468
00:41:55,887 --> 00:41:58,586
Wanna check in first?

469
00:41:59,906 --> 00:42:02,090
How about we explore the town a bit first?

470
00:42:02,090 --> 00:42:04,571
Or do you want to freshen up?

471
00:42:04,571 --> 00:42:06,817
I'm fine, let's go straight there.

472
00:42:06,817 --> 00:42:10,683
- Just follow the road, I remember the way.
- Got it.

473
00:43:05,400 --> 00:43:06,560
[Grandma Jan's Restaurant]

474
00:43:15,913 --> 00:43:17,573
Here it is.

475
00:43:17,573 --> 00:43:21,580
The shop and all the land behind it,
stretching to the hill over there,

476
00:43:21,580 --> 00:43:23,710
it's all theirs.

477
00:43:25,927 --> 00:43:27,203
Perfect.

478
00:43:27,203 --> 00:43:32,640
Oh, and as agreed,
let's go meet Aunt Jaew and Granny Jan first.

479
00:43:32,640 --> 00:43:34,430
No negotiations, okay?

480
00:43:34,430 --> 00:43:36,550
Got it.

481
00:43:38,957 --> 00:43:41,030
Aunt Jaew!

482
00:43:43,709 --> 00:43:45,290
It's me, Cha!

483
00:43:45,290 --> 00:43:47,760
Is the larb ready yet?

484
00:43:47,760 --> 00:43:51,430
It's here! Fresh larb coming right up!
