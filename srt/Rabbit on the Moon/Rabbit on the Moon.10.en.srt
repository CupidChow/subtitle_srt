00:01:02,947 --> 00:01:04,773
Aunt Jaew.

3
00:01:04,773 --> 00:01:06,313
It's me, Cha.

4
00:01:06,313 --> 00:01:08,847
Is the larb ready yet?

5
00:01:08,847 --> 00:01:12,440
It's here! Fresh larb coming right up!

6
00:01:21,193 --> 00:01:24,760
Pass it over. Just the right flavor.

Want some beer too?

9
00:01:31,412 --> 00:01:34,220
Yes, that'd be perfect.

10
00:01:34,220 --> 00:01:35,600
Bring it over!

11
00:01:35,600 --> 00:01:36,560
Perfect timing.

This is Jira, the landowner,
and Wasu from Land and Life.

13
00:01:41,467 --> 00:01:44,147
- Hello.
- Hello.

14
00:01:50,080 --> 00:01:53,760
When did you get back?

15
00:01:55,889 --> 00:01:57,293
Two days ago.

16
00:01:57,293 --> 00:02:00,373
Are you planning to stay here for good?

17
00:02:00,373 --> 00:02:02,940
Not sure yet.

18
00:02:03,860 --> 00:02:05,913
You came to see the land?

19
00:02:05,913 --> 00:02:09,740
Yeah, Wasu wanted to take a look.

20
00:02:10,493 --> 00:02:13,693
Great. There's a lot of land around here.

21
00:02:13,693 --> 00:02:16,173
But I'm not selling mine.

22
00:02:16,173 --> 00:02:19,180
I've told Plew that many times already.

23
00:02:19,180 --> 00:02:22,913
Yes, she told me.

24
00:02:23,700 --> 00:02:27,947
Good. I like straightforward people.

I just want to talk to him a bit.
It's been a while.

Okay, and how will you get back?

35

Don't worry, I'll manage.

Can we talk for a minute?

41
00:03:57,553 --> 00:04:00,500
How've you been? All good?

42
00:04:01,967 --> 00:04:07,440
I'm doing really well.
Just started working with Land recently.

43
00:04:07,440 --> 00:04:10,267
It's a new partnership.

44
00:04:13,727 --> 00:04:16,600
- You look so much better now.
- Plew.

45

I'm not selling this land.

46
00:04:21,693 --> 00:04:29,793
No matter who you bring, Anita or your new friend,
I'm not selling.

47
00:04:29,793 --> 00:04:32,573
I already told him it's not for sale. I...

48
00:04:32,573 --> 00:04:38,287
When I walked out and saw you,
I thought I was dreaming.

49
00:04:38,287 --> 00:04:40,893
I was so happy.

50
00:04:40,893 --> 00:04:47,460
But once I saw you were here with that Land guy,
clearly here to look at my land,

51
00:04:48,620 --> 00:04:50,860
I wasn't so thrilled anymore.

52
00:04:51,773 --> 00:04:55,480
I told him already.
I said this place isn't for sale.

53
00:04:55,480 --> 00:04:57,740
So why'd you come?

54
00:04:58,500 --> 00:05:00,560
To see me?

55
00:05:01,955 --> 00:05:04,142
Doubt it.

56
00:05:07,227 --> 00:05:10,840
Still, I'm happy to see you.

57
00:05:10,840 --> 00:05:12,987
Really happy.

Let me know when you're leaving.

00:08:30,613 --> 00:08:34,180

I've tried not to. Tried to just be friends.

73
00:11:09,193 --> 00:11:11,173
Tried going far away, doing everything I could.

74
00:11:11,173 --> 00:11:14,647
Tried to focus only on how impossible it is,
only on my own future.

00:11:14,647 --> 00:11:16,820
But I can't.

76
00:11:16,820 --> 00:11:20,620

I really can't.

this could work.</i>

- Sure.

Salted rice.

94
00:12:52,553 --> 00:12:56,740
Hot sticky rice with a bit of salt.
It's delicious.

95
00:12:56,740 --> 00:12:59,328
Is this even good for your health, Grandma?

96
00:12:59,328 --> 00:13:02,795
Have you eaten yet, dear?
There's food in the kitchen.

Oh wow, probably ten.

00:13:15,320 --> 00:13:20,047
They're all gathered down at the far end,
about four rai altogether.

101
00:13:20,047 --> 00:13:22,300
Why are you asking?

102
00:13:23,440 --> 00:13:25,653
Don't let anyone else move in just yet.

103
00:13:25,653 --> 00:13:28,980

I want to turn our home into a tourist spot.

104
00:13:31,780 --> 00:13:33,773
So now that you're back, what are you going to do?

105
00:13:33,773 --> 00:13:35,940
Do you have any capital?

106
00:13:35,940 --> 00:13:38,047
However much I have, I'll start with that.

107
00:13:38,047 --> 00:13:42,220
I'll plan carefully.
I'm not staying in Bangkok anymore.

108
00:13:43,988 --> 00:13:46,840
Well, it's nice that you're back home.

109
00:13:46,840 --> 00:13:50,980
Whatever we've got, it's still home.

110
00:13:51,727 --> 00:13:53,520
Even if there's nothing to eat,

111
00:13:53,520 --> 00:13:57,860
sticky rice with salt shared with me and Grandma
tastes amazing.

112
00:13:58,580 --> 00:14:00,953
Mom, chill. Don't be so dramatic.

113
00:14:00,953 --> 00:14:03,718
But it really is good, Ji. Try it.

114
00:14:03,718 --> 00:14:05,660
No thanks.

115
00:14:09,707 --> 00:14:13,553
It's probably going to be exhausting,
but I think I can manage.

116
00:14:19,793 --> 00:14:21,367
Sorry I'm late.

117
00:14:21,367 --> 00:14:25,100
No need to apologize.
You're not late, I'm just early.

118
00:14:25,820 --> 00:14:28,993
I wasn't sure what you'd want to eat,
so I ordered some homemade yogurt.

119
00:14:28,993 --> 00:14:31,807
They do it really well. It tastes great.

120
00:14:33,513 --> 00:14:37,240
Last time I was here, I ate it every day.

121
00:14:38,073 --> 00:14:40,267
Who were you with last time?

122
00:14:40,267 --> 00:14:42,820
The Chinese investor you mentioned before?

123
00:14:44,320 --> 00:14:47,360
Your friend's land yesterday is really beautiful.

124
00:14:47,360 --> 00:14:49,860
It's a shame if he really doesn't want to sell.

125
00:14:50,893 --> 00:14:53,907
He doesn't seem like someone
who's easy to buy from.

126
00:14:55,360 --> 00:14:57,073
I'll take you to see another site today.

127
00:14:57,073 --> 00:15:00,007
It's a bit far, but really stunning.

128
00:15:00,007 --> 00:15:01,340
Alright.

Do you come to Nan often?

130
00:15:07,747 --> 00:15:11,900
Quite a few times already. It's so peaceful here.

131
00:15:11,900 --> 00:15:20,407
The locals are super nice,
always suggesting what to eat or where to go.

132
00:15:20,407 --> 00:15:25,313
I've only been here a few times,
just for vacations, not for work like this.

133
00:16:11,140 --> 00:16:12,860
Are you tired?

134
00:16:14,273 --> 00:16:16,380
A little, Mom.

135
00:16:16,380 --> 00:16:18,840
Your sister probably won't be
helping out much anymore.

136
00:16:18,840 --> 00:16:21,020
Sounds like her job's going well.

137
00:16:27,507 --> 00:16:31,427
Mom... Are you lonely?

138
00:16:32,584 --> 00:16:38,540
If I didn't look up,
I'd have thought Pitcha was the one talking.

139
00:16:40,480 --> 00:16:45,047
I see you just staying at home
or going to the club.

140

Dressing up nice is for myself.

They say when someone starts asking
emotional questions,

147
00:17:17,053 --> 00:17:19,733
it usually means they're suffering.

148
00:17:19,733 --> 00:17:23,093
Not just uneasy, suffering.

149
00:17:35,900 --> 00:17:37,900
How's Laks doing?

150
00:17:42,567 --> 00:17:45,340
Same as always, Mom.

I feel like I'm not everything to him.

156
00:18:16,697 --> 00:18:21,617
You're starting to sound like Cha again.

157
00:18:23,587 --> 00:18:29,267
In a marriage, it's enough to see the big picture.

158
00:18:29,267 --> 00:18:35,340
Don't dig into every little detail,
it'll just make you frustrated.

159
00:18:36,653 --> 00:18:38,627
Oh! I almost forgot.

160
00:18:38,627 --> 00:18:42,080
I got some Marian plums.
They've already taken out the seeds.

161
00:18:42,080 --> 00:18:44,013
They were selling them at the club.

162
00:18:44,013 --> 00:18:45,340

By the way, is your sister still in Bangkok?

166
00:18:58,427 --> 00:19:03,620
I don't think so.
She said she's going to check out land in Nan.

167
00:19:04,880 --> 00:19:06,140
With who?

168
00:19:06,140 --> 00:19:08,847
With Wasu. Wasu from Land and Life.

Is there a coffee shop nearby?

175
00:19:53,960 --> 00:19:56,040
I want to check some photos.
It might take a while.

There's a hotel not far from here.

179
00:20:04,435 --> 00:20:05,553
No, I'm not hungry.

180
00:20:05,553 --> 00:20:09,640
But let's grab something to eat there,
and head out again in the evening.

181
00:20:09,640 --> 00:20:10,960
Alright.

182
00:20:13,938 --> 00:20:15,480
I'm going to freshen up first,
wash my face and hands.

183
00:20:15,480 --> 00:20:16,560
It's hot.

184
00:20:16,560 --> 00:20:19,087
You go ahead, I'll watch our stuff.

185
00:20:19,087 --> 00:20:21,047
How about you go first? I can wait.

186
00:20:21,047 --> 00:20:24,127
No, you go. You look all dusty.

187
00:20:41,773 --> 00:20:43,527
The air here's nice.

188
00:20:43,527 --> 00:20:47,013
If we get the chance,
I'd love to visit again together.

189
00:20:47,013 --> 00:20:48,300
Sure.

190
00:20:50,173 --> 00:20:55,253
Oh, were you planning to buy souvenirs?
Who are you buying for?

191
00:20:55,253 --> 00:20:57,113
Let's buy some for our families.

192
00:20:57,113 --> 00:20:59,140
Yeah, that's a good idea.

193
00:20:59,140 --> 00:21:03,393
I'll just get a few small things.
No one's really at home these days anyway.

194
00:21:03,393 --> 00:21:05,580
Pitcha, I'm all set.

195
00:21:31,240 --> 00:21:33,360
Cha, are you here to look at land, dear?

196
00:21:36,413 --> 00:21:39,573
If you want to talk,
wait until we're back in Bangkok.

197
00:21:39,573 --> 00:21:42,827
No, Dad. Let's talk now.

198
00:21:42,827 --> 00:21:45,833
Who is that woman?

199
00:21:56,600 --> 00:21:58,513
Araya.

200
00:21:58,513 --> 00:22:01,460
I've been with her for almost ten years.

201
00:22:24,280 --> 00:22:29,200
Araya, this is my youngest daughter, Pitcha.

202
00:22:34,940 --> 00:22:36,460
Cha.

203
00:22:37,973 --> 00:22:39,820
This is Araya.

204
00:22:40,920 --> 00:22:45,487
She's the woman you've been with for nearly
ten years while you were still with my mom.

205
00:22:45,487 --> 00:22:48,060
That's called a mistress.

206
00:23:00,767 --> 00:23:02,720
Please wait in the car.

207
00:23:04,907 --> 00:23:06,140
Okay.

208
00:23:32,427 --> 00:23:34,200
<i>Hello?</i>

209
00:23:36,527 --> 00:23:38,460
<i>Pitcha.</i>

210
00:23:40,093 --> 00:23:41,900
<i>Cha.</i>

211
00:23:44,360 --> 00:23:46,320
Hello...

212
00:23:49,553 --> 00:23:52,027
I'm sorry, Cha.

213
00:23:52,027 --> 00:23:54,187
It's all my fault. Everything.

214
00:23:54,187 --> 00:23:57,640
I already know about that part, Dad.
Let's talk about what I don't know.

215
00:23:57,640 --> 00:23:59,260
Like...

216
00:24:01,352 --> 00:24:02,560
that woman.

217
00:24:02,560 --> 00:24:04,487
She's not even impressive.

218
00:24:04,487 --> 00:24:07,500
She's old. She's dull.

219
00:24:07,500 --> 00:24:10,467
I don't get it.

220
00:24:10,467 --> 00:24:14,213
Were you cursed or something? What was it?

221
00:24:16,053 --> 00:24:18,713
- Do you even know...
- I really am sorry.

222
00:24:18,713 --> 00:24:22,280
I don't even know how to explain to you
why I did what I...

223
00:24:22,280 --> 00:24:24,547
Did you get her pregnant?

224
00:24:24,547 --> 00:24:28,967
No. We never even planned on having kids together.

225
00:24:28,967 --> 00:24:31,073
Then what is it?

226
00:24:32,297 --> 00:24:34,537
Do you love her?

227
00:24:38,091 --> 00:24:40,420
Do you love her, Dad?

228
00:24:47,080 --> 00:24:48,740
Dad!

229
00:24:55,220 --> 00:24:59,540
I feel at ease when I'm with her.

230
00:25:11,687 --> 00:25:17,260
It might sound like a stupid excuse,
but it's the truth.

231
00:25:17,260 --> 00:25:21,007
No one's to blame but me.

232
00:25:21,007 --> 00:25:25,860
You two girls are the best thing in my life.

233
00:25:25,860 --> 00:25:29,413
Your mother too, she's never done anything wrong.

234
00:25:29,413 --> 00:25:33,973
But a lot of things made me feel
like I couldn't breathe.

235
00:25:33,973 --> 00:25:37,033
I just wanted to live at home like a regular man.

236
00:25:37,033 --> 00:25:41,360
Cook something simple. Wear simple clothes.

237
00:25:41,360 --> 00:25:47,720
My job is full of formalities, layers, rules.

238
00:25:47,720 --> 00:25:53,180
Even at home,
I never really felt like I could rest.

239
00:25:54,693 --> 00:25:59,880
I told your mom I just wanted to relax sometimes,

240
00:25:59,880 --> 00:26:05,740
but she said everything about her life
had to look perfect.

241
00:26:28,120 --> 00:26:32,360
She said every part of her life
had to be polished.

242
00:26:32,360 --> 00:26:35,180
It sounds like a small thing...

243
00:26:48,207 --> 00:26:54,180
but it's exhausting,
like living inside a show home all the time.

244
00:27:21,193 --> 00:27:25,060
She never respected me in front of others.

245
00:27:25,060 --> 00:27:27,807
She'd speak harshly, and never apologized.

246
00:27:27,807 --> 00:27:30,293
Always critical, always strict.

247
00:27:30,293 --> 00:27:36,660
For over 30 years, I've eaten just because
it was time, not because I was hungry.

248
00:27:36,660 --> 00:27:41,340
I've never even worn shorts at home.

249
00:27:42,040 --> 00:27:46,193
But that's still not an excuse
to have someone else.

250
00:27:46,193 --> 00:27:48,460
I agree.

251
00:27:49,487 --> 00:27:57,900
Even if the person you're with has flaws,
cheating is still inexcusable.

252
00:27:59,000 --> 00:28:05,953
That's why I said I'm to blame.
I betrayed your mom.

253
00:28:05,953 --> 00:28:08,907
Does she know about all this?

254
00:28:26,181 --> 00:28:28,740
I have to get back to work now.

255
00:28:28,740 --> 00:28:32,107
There's something I want to talk to you about.

256
00:28:32,107 --> 00:28:36,093
It may seem unrelated to you, but it is.

257
00:28:36,860 --> 00:28:39,940
Let's set a time to talk when we're back.

258
00:29:09,990 --> 00:29:11,460
Sorry, I...

259
00:29:11,460 --> 00:29:15,667
The shots you took are great.
There's a lot, should be enough.

260
00:29:15,667 --> 00:29:17,240
I'm starving now,

261
00:29:17,240 --> 00:29:20,080
but I didn't know what you'd want to eat,
so I waited.

262
00:29:20,080 --> 00:29:24,638
Sorry. Would you like to eat here,
or go somewhere else?

263
00:29:24,638 --> 00:29:28,177
Somewhere else sounds better.
Got any recommendations?

264
00:29:28,974 --> 00:29:31,913
Yes, about 15 minutes from here.

265
00:29:31,913 --> 00:29:34,080
I have the number for the place.

266
00:29:34,080 --> 00:29:36,807
I'll call ahead
so the food's ready when we arrive.

267
00:29:36,807 --> 00:29:38,047
Great.

268
00:29:38,967 --> 00:29:40,453
Let's go.

269
00:29:47,960 --> 00:29:49,520
[Huan Hom - Local Cuisine]

270
00:29:54,600 --> 00:29:57,233
Would you like to rest tomorrow?

271
00:29:57,233 --> 00:30:00,347
I can go check the land by myself.
I do it all the time.

272
00:30:03,007 --> 00:30:07,227
Or if you think I'm someone you can talk to,
anything at all.

273
00:30:08,300 --> 00:30:11,620
What do you think about infidelity in marriage?

274
00:30:14,500 --> 00:30:16,220
Depends on the person, I guess.

275
00:30:16,220 --> 00:30:19,093
Depends on what they've been through.

276
00:30:19,093 --> 00:30:24,340
All that high-minded talk and pretty theories,
anyone can say that.

277
00:30:24,340 --> 00:30:26,527
But you have to experience it to know.

278
00:30:29,547 --> 00:30:34,027
What about you? What do you think about cheating?

279
00:30:34,027 --> 00:30:36,847
I don't think I'll ever get married.

280
00:30:37,500 --> 00:30:40,940
It feels unnecessary.

281
00:30:42,327 --> 00:30:48,113
Unless it's someone I really love,
want to build a family with,

282
00:30:48,113 --> 00:30:56,340
or pass down a business to,
I just don't see the point in marriage.

283
00:30:56,340 --> 00:30:59,727
- Same here.
- Right? It just doesn't feel right anymore.

284
00:30:59,727 --> 00:31:03,207
Can we really share everything
with another person?

285
00:31:03,207 --> 00:31:07,127
Can you really share all the joy and the pain?

286
00:31:07,127 --> 00:31:13,180
And their parents become your parents too.
Can that actually work?

287
00:31:14,307 --> 00:31:16,587
Or maybe we just haven't met the right person?

288
00:31:19,153 --> 00:31:24,060
The furthest I've ever gone with someone
was almost two years.

289
00:31:25,720 --> 00:31:30,340
I've had someone I wanted to be with
but I knew it'd never happen.

290
00:31:31,985 --> 00:31:34,032
The guy from yesterday?

291
00:31:35,893 --> 00:31:37,827
Just guessing.

292
00:31:37,827 --> 00:31:41,047
You two seemed strangely in sync.

293
00:31:41,047 --> 00:31:43,800
When you want something
but can't really go for it,

294
00:31:43,800 --> 00:31:45,827
it sticks with you.

295
00:31:45,827 --> 00:31:49,713
It lingers so much, it leaves a mark.

296
00:31:49,713 --> 00:31:53,400
You keep wondering how good it could have been.

297
00:31:54,087 --> 00:31:55,620
Is that right?

298
00:31:56,667 --> 00:32:00,020
Can I ask why you didn't date him?

299
00:32:18,213 --> 00:32:21,553
Hey, Grandma. What are you doing up so late?

300
00:32:21,553 --> 00:32:22,787
Ji.

301
00:32:26,567 --> 00:32:28,100
Come sit, dear.

302
00:32:30,827 --> 00:32:36,807
I want to ask for the land at the edge
of the farm, about five or six rai.

303
00:32:36,807 --> 00:32:41,180
Of course, Grandma.
Isn't it yours already? Why are you asking?

304
00:32:41,180 --> 00:32:49,213
I let the villagers use it to grow food,
but I didn't give it away. We just share the land.

305
00:32:49,213 --> 00:32:53,580
You can use any part you want,

306
00:32:53,580 --> 00:32:59,580
just leave that section
so they can keep earning a living.

307
00:32:59,580 --> 00:33:05,160
They wake up with the sun, live off the land.

308
00:33:05,160 --> 00:33:09,953
If we take that land from them, it'll be tough.

309
00:33:09,953 --> 00:33:14,873
There aren't many people like that anymore,
rising with the sky, sleeping with the soil.

310
00:33:14,873 --> 00:33:25,327
It reminds me of my childhood,
running through the fields and hills.

311
00:33:25,327 --> 00:33:31,273
Grandma, I promise I won't touch that land.

312
00:33:31,273 --> 00:33:34,600
Maybe you can even give more land
to the villagers.

313
00:33:34,600 --> 00:33:37,480
You just wait for me to come back.

314
00:33:37,480 --> 00:33:39,413
Don't worry, Grandma.

315
00:33:46,200 --> 00:33:47,920
[Mom]

316
00:33:56,967 --> 00:33:59,740
- Yes, Mom?
- <i>Cha.</i>

317
00:33:59,740 --> 00:34:02,713
Is there something you wanted to talk about?

318
00:34:03,736 --> 00:34:06,560
No, I accidentally hit call. Sorry.

319
00:34:06,560 --> 00:34:07,709
<i>Oh really?</i>

320
00:34:07,709 --> 00:34:11,233
I thought something important came up.

321
00:34:11,233 --> 00:34:15,100
Hey, you went to check land in Nan, right?

322
00:34:15,100 --> 00:34:16,347
Yes, Mom.

323
00:34:16,347 --> 00:34:19,913
Your father's there too on a work trip.

324
00:34:19,913 --> 00:34:21,580
Oh? Really?

325
00:34:21,580 --> 00:34:27,687
Yes, but he's back today.
Said he'd be home late tonight.

326
00:34:27,687 --> 00:34:29,038
I see...

327
00:34:29,038 --> 00:34:33,127
<i>Cha, come visit me sometime.</i>

328
00:34:33,127 --> 00:34:37,373
I get lonely when you're not around.

329
00:34:37,373 --> 00:34:40,740
No one's here to tease me. I miss you.

330
00:34:40,740 --> 00:34:43,020
I miss you too, Mom.

331
00:34:43,020 --> 00:34:51,593
After you finish up there,
come to see me. Let's have a meal together.

332
00:34:51,593 --> 00:34:53,180
Okay, Mom.

333
00:35:17,433 --> 00:35:19,833
Lock up tight, alright?

334
00:35:19,833 --> 00:35:21,453
I will.

335
00:35:21,453 --> 00:35:23,200
Ti...

336
00:35:24,620 --> 00:35:27,440
If Kot finds out, do you think she'll...

337
00:35:27,440 --> 00:35:33,673
Don't overthink it. Pitcha speaks directly,
but she's thoughtful.

338
00:35:33,673 --> 00:35:37,527
Telling her mom wouldn't help anyone.

339
00:35:37,527 --> 00:35:39,020
She knows.

340
00:35:43,553 --> 00:35:46,460
Let's go inside. Don't dwell on it.

341
00:35:47,767 --> 00:35:49,033
Okay.

342
00:35:49,887 --> 00:35:51,807
Get home safe.

343
00:37:57,567 --> 00:37:59,011
You're up early.

344
00:37:59,011 --> 00:38:00,553
I went to bed early last night.

345
00:38:00,553 --> 00:38:04,167
You came back late too.
I heard you while I was showering.

346
00:38:04,167 --> 00:38:07,580
Sorry. I tried to be quiet.

347
00:38:08,420 --> 00:38:11,327
Oh, I brought back coffee beans from Nan.

348
00:38:11,327 --> 00:38:13,660
They're famous for being really good.

349
00:38:13,660 --> 00:38:17,826
The coffee's nice,
but the dried bananas were amazing.

350
00:38:17,826 --> 00:38:21,014
Whoa, did you try everything?

351
00:38:21,014 --> 00:38:26,940
Well, I had to see how thoughtful my husband was
in choosing gifts for his wife.

352
00:38:32,373 --> 00:38:35,960
Oh, and Pitcha's in Nan too.

353
00:38:38,260 --> 00:38:41,460
She called, but the line cut off,
so we didn't get to talk.

354
00:38:46,006 --> 00:38:51,047
Come home for dinner Friday.
I've reserved some shrimp.

355
00:38:51,047 --> 00:38:53,014
I'm planning to make chu chee curry.

356
00:38:53,803 --> 00:38:56,340
I haven't had that in a while.

357
00:38:56,340 --> 00:39:00,660
I'll call both the kids.

358
00:39:02,342 --> 00:39:06,020
Good idea, it's been a while
since we all ate together.

359
00:39:22,440 --> 00:39:26,133
I'll drop off Mr. Wasu
and then head straight to Mook's office.

360
00:39:26,133 --> 00:39:27,873
You parked there?

361
00:39:27,873 --> 00:39:29,131
Yes.

362
00:39:29,131 --> 00:39:30,700
Hungry?

363
00:39:30,700 --> 00:39:32,567
Not yet. You?

364
00:39:32,567 --> 00:39:34,060
Not yet.

365
00:39:40,793 --> 00:39:43,580
Do you think we'd make a good match?

366
00:39:46,093 --> 00:39:48,501
Have you picked the land already?

367
00:39:48,501 --> 00:39:51,033
I didn't mean that.

368
00:39:51,033 --> 00:39:52,467
I meant us.

369
00:39:54,654 --> 00:39:56,427
I know it's been a short time.

370
00:39:56,427 --> 00:40:00,860
But I know myself well enough to know.
I click with you.

371
00:40:06,127 --> 00:40:10,527
No pressure. Just a conversation, not a proposal.

372
00:40:15,840 --> 00:40:18,627
Take your time. No rush.

373
00:40:39,000 --> 00:40:40,980
I'll call you.

374
00:40:56,320 --> 00:40:59,647
Feels like he just asked my mom for permission.

375
00:41:15,950 --> 00:41:18,100
Two coffees, please.

376
00:41:19,567 --> 00:41:24,440
So? Did you sell anything?
Was he interested in any of the land?

377
00:41:24,440 --> 00:41:27,180
No sale, just drama.

378
00:41:28,660 --> 00:41:30,540
What now?

379
00:41:32,087 --> 00:41:35,420
It felt like I walked into a storm.

380
00:41:35,420 --> 00:41:37,827
What do you call those spinning ones again?

381
00:41:37,827 --> 00:41:41,287
Tornado? Hurricane?

382
00:41:41,287 --> 00:41:44,420
Yeah, yeah, whatever.

383
00:41:44,420 --> 00:41:50,060
It felt like I got hit
by three giant spinning storms in a row.

384
00:41:50,060 --> 00:41:52,713
Three in a row, you know?

385
00:41:53,513 --> 00:41:56,887
Okay, spill it.

386
00:41:58,613 --> 00:42:02,447
I ran into both Jira and Mr. Wasu
at the same time.

387
00:42:02,447 --> 00:42:04,540
Jira?

388
00:42:04,540 --> 00:42:06,540
It was Jay.

389
00:42:09,760 --> 00:42:17,760
I felt like I got electrocuted, ears ringing,
arms and legs numb, nerves frozen.

390
00:42:17,760 --> 00:42:20,000
I pinched myself and didn't even feel pain.

391
00:42:20,707 --> 00:42:22,500
And then he kissed me.

392
00:42:22,500 --> 00:42:24,413
What?

393
00:42:24,413 --> 00:42:27,260
And I kissed him back.

394
00:42:28,740 --> 00:42:31,180
Are you serious?

395
00:42:31,933 --> 00:42:34,620
That was bombshell number one.

396
00:42:34,620 --> 00:42:41,073
The next day, I saw my dad
with a woman who wasn't my mom.

397
00:42:41,073 --> 00:42:44,633
He told me they've been together for ten years.

398
00:42:44,633 --> 00:42:46,447
Oh my god, girl.

399
00:42:46,447 --> 00:42:50,027
Yup, that was bombshell number two.

400
00:42:50,027 --> 00:42:52,680
Now wait for number three.

401
00:42:54,287 --> 00:42:57,653
Mr. Wasu asked me to be with him.

402
00:42:57,653 --> 00:43:00,713
Well, that last one's not so bad, is it?

403
00:43:00,713 --> 00:43:04,580
Not bad? I just realized something...

404
00:43:07,757 --> 00:43:10,757
Wait, don't tell me...

405
00:43:12,600 --> 00:43:15,820
I still have strong feelings for Jira.

406
00:43:24,713 --> 00:43:27,267
- Do we have wine?
- Yes.

407
00:43:27,267 --> 00:43:29,113
- Two...
- Glasses?

408
00:43:29,113 --> 00:43:30,540
- Bottles!
- Bottles!

409
00:43:30,540 --> 00:43:32,073
Okay, okay.

410
00:43:33,280 --> 00:43:35,520
[Car Loft]

411
00:43:36,733 --> 00:43:38,973
Since when have you had a thing with him?

412
00:43:38,973 --> 00:43:42,273
And what about that photo in the alumni
Line group, the one that caused a scandal?

413
00:43:42,273 --> 00:43:45,940
You're not worried about that anymore?

414
00:43:46,740 --> 00:43:48,773
What about your mom?

415
00:43:48,773 --> 00:43:51,480
You're the daughter of Mr. Kitti, remember?

416
00:43:51,480 --> 00:43:54,573
Kitti, with the ugly mistress?

417
00:43:54,573 --> 00:43:57,580
Pitcha, I'm serious.

418
00:43:57,580 --> 00:44:00,607
More serious than my dad having an affair?

419
00:44:00,607 --> 00:44:02,800
That's a different issue.

420
00:44:02,800 --> 00:44:05,547
A man like your dad having a mistress
isn't that surprising.

421
00:44:05,547 --> 00:44:11,380
But you, falling for a bar guy? That's not okay.

422
00:44:11,380 --> 00:44:13,073
Why not?

423
00:44:13,073 --> 00:44:15,880
I'm asking you as a friend.

424
00:44:15,880 --> 00:44:21,220
If I seriously dated Jira, what would you think?
Would you be okay with it?

425
00:44:23,849 --> 00:44:26,109
Honestly?

426
00:44:27,280 --> 00:44:31,440
No, I don't get it. It should just be for fun.
Pay and walk away.

427
00:44:31,440 --> 00:44:32,727
The end.

428
00:44:32,727 --> 00:44:36,027
If that's your happiness, I won't judge.

429
00:44:36,027 --> 00:44:39,527
But a serious relationship? Come on.

430
00:44:39,527 --> 00:44:41,100
Could you really do that?

431
00:44:42,553 --> 00:44:46,647
These days, no matter what someone's done,
no matter how long it's been,

432
00:44:46,647 --> 00:44:51,147
if someone wants to dig it up, they will.

433
00:44:51,147 --> 00:44:54,233
And this guy? Bar host.

434
00:44:54,233 --> 00:44:57,593
All over Instagram and TikTok.
Everything's out there.

435
00:44:57,593 --> 00:45:00,580
How are you going to erase all that?

436
00:45:03,160 --> 00:45:10,461
Even if he's a great guy, builds a future,
gets rich, gets married, has kids,

437
00:45:10,461 --> 00:45:15,853
one day your child will ask,
"What did Dad do? How did he start his life?"

438
00:45:15,853 --> 00:45:17,140
What are you going to say?

439
00:45:17,140 --> 00:45:18,720
By the time my kid grows up,

440
00:45:18,720 --> 00:45:21,673
nobody will care
about that kind of thing anymore, right?

441
00:45:23,787 --> 00:45:28,120
It's not about the era,
it's about people's nature.

442
00:45:28,120 --> 00:45:31,087
If people want to judge, they will.

443
00:45:31,087 --> 00:45:34,007
So are you judging me?

444
00:45:37,187 --> 00:45:39,440
It doesn't matter who judges.

445
00:45:39,440 --> 00:45:42,116
What matters is
if you're really serious about dating him,

446
00:45:42,116 --> 00:45:44,003
are you brave enough?

447
00:45:51,300 --> 00:45:55,720
Actually, the world economy is too bad.

448
00:45:55,720 --> 00:45:58,723
But fashion is still perfect.

449
00:45:58,723 --> 00:45:59,827
That's true.

450
00:45:59,827 --> 00:46:03,993
Especially in beauty enhancement
and anti-aging group, right?

451
00:46:03,993 --> 00:46:05,147
Right.

452
00:46:05,147 --> 00:46:06,240
Agree.

453
00:46:06,240 --> 00:46:11,460
There won't be old people,
only young people like us.

454
00:46:12,707 --> 00:46:15,500
I agree with you.

455
00:46:18,407 --> 00:46:22,620
Well, would you like to go to a night club
with good music today?

456
00:46:22,620 --> 00:46:24,540
I'll take you there.

457
00:46:27,453 --> 00:46:30,073
- I'll think about it.
- Sure.

458
00:46:31,407 --> 00:46:36,247
I think you should go enjoy these guys a bit.

459
00:46:36,247 --> 00:46:40,587
I've hung out with them before...

460
00:46:40,587 --> 00:46:43,180
They're perfect in every way.

461
00:46:45,653 --> 00:46:46,920
And you know what?

462
00:46:46,920 --> 00:46:51,173
In Thailand, we used the same host.

463
00:46:52,500 --> 00:47:01,093
I once asked Tiwa where Jay had gone,
and she said Jay went abroad for half a year.

464
00:47:01,093 --> 00:47:03,467
I was like, "Wow".

465
00:47:03,467 --> 00:47:07,460
"Who managed to keep him for that long", I wonder?

466
00:47:08,100 --> 00:47:12,127
I once tried to get him to go to Chiang Mai
with me for four to five days.

467
00:47:12,127 --> 00:47:15,780
Offered good money too. He still said no.

468
00:47:17,233 --> 00:47:21,440
What's your secret? Share it!

469
00:47:46,933 --> 00:47:48,645
Hello, everyone.

470
00:47:48,645 --> 00:47:49,907
Hello.

471
00:47:49,907 --> 00:47:52,520
Haven't seen you in a while.

472
00:47:52,520 --> 00:47:54,267
Been busy lately.

473
00:47:54,267 --> 00:47:58,360
But I finally had time,
so I wanted to invite Mr. Kitti out for lunch.

474
00:47:58,360 --> 00:48:03,467
Here, I brought your favorite again,
dried bananas.

475
00:48:03,467 --> 00:48:04,647
Thanks.

476
00:48:04,647 --> 00:48:10,180
It's from that famous curry place.
I even ordered extra pickles.

477
00:48:14,223 --> 00:48:15,567
Kot.

478
00:48:15,567 --> 00:48:17,427
You didn't say you were coming.

479
00:48:17,427 --> 00:48:18,960
I wasn't planning to at first.

480
00:48:18,960 --> 00:48:21,607
But since I had free time,
I thought I'd ask you to lunch.

481
00:48:21,607 --> 00:48:28,347
And to take Mr. Kitti out for lunch,
do I need permission from his staff now?

482
00:48:28,347 --> 00:48:32,147
No, but I do have to wait until lunch break.
Gotta follows the rules.

483
00:48:32,147 --> 00:48:33,853
Fair enough.

484
00:48:40,560 --> 00:48:43,800
[Curry]

485
00:48:53,193 --> 00:48:55,520
You took her to Nan with you, didn't you?
