1
00:01:11,040 --> 00:01:13,760
My land must be really beautiful, huh?

2
00:01:13,760 --> 00:01:16,720
You and Anita both want it that badly.

3
00:01:19,767 --> 00:01:21,727
The food's probably here.

4
00:01:48,060 --> 00:01:50,534
You're still up?

5
00:01:57,680 --> 00:01:59,360
Not sleepy yet.

6
00:01:59,360 --> 00:02:02,554
Feels like a waste to go to bed early...

7
00:02:05,687 --> 00:02:08,247
since we're leaving tomorrow.

8
00:02:15,900 --> 00:02:18,707
Want me to join you for a drink in your room?

9
00:02:20,587 --> 00:02:25,214
Why the sudden kindness?
Weren't you just telling me to go to bed?

10
00:02:49,627 --> 00:02:54,594
Well, I saw you were busy.
You have that morning meeting tomorrow, right?

11
00:03:03,587 --> 00:03:05,614
Can I ask you something?

12
00:03:06,467 --> 00:03:09,940
I can't think of the right word.
What's the Thai way of saying it...

13
00:03:09,940 --> 00:03:14,927
Informal, like not serious.

14
00:03:14,927 --> 00:03:17,287
Just asking for fun?

15
00:03:18,067 --> 00:03:20,367
Just asking casually.

16
00:03:21,387 --> 00:03:26,994
If I asked you to come live in Shanghai
for a while,

17
00:03:26,994 --> 00:03:29,247
how much would you charge?

18
00:03:34,874 --> 00:03:36,607
Hold on.

19
00:03:40,827 --> 00:03:42,167
Go in.

20
00:03:44,247 --> 00:03:46,154
Here's the food you ordered.

21
00:03:46,154 --> 00:03:47,947
Please, go ahead.

22
00:04:03,139 --> 00:04:08,340
Oh, that looks great. Can I add one more order?

23
00:04:08,340 --> 00:04:09,394
Sure.

24
00:04:09,394 --> 00:04:12,040
Please make it as quick as possible
so we can eat together.

25
00:04:12,040 --> 00:04:14,147
Oh, and one more side of fries too.

26
00:04:14,147 --> 00:04:16,780
Of course, I'll rush it for you.

27
00:04:25,454 --> 00:04:27,254
I'm gonna go wash my hands.

28
00:04:27,254 --> 00:04:28,700
Yeah.

29
00:04:44,727 --> 00:04:48,514
I didn't feel hungry
until I smelled your porridge.

30
00:04:52,647 --> 00:04:56,714
Do you think my face will be puffy tomorrow
if I eat fries now?

31
00:04:59,657 --> 00:05:04,084
It's fine. Just drink lots of water afterward.

32
00:05:06,154 --> 00:05:07,554
Come on.

33
00:05:17,214 --> 00:05:19,400
If you're hungry, you can start with mine.

34
00:05:24,014 --> 00:05:27,259
I'm going to wash my face.

35
00:05:36,240 --> 00:05:37,687
Plew.

36
00:05:38,507 --> 00:05:39,994
Plew.

37
00:05:42,852 --> 00:05:46,287
Please, do whatever it takes
to get her out of the room.

38
00:05:46,287 --> 00:05:49,714
What am I supposed to do?
She ordered porridge to eat with me already.

39
00:05:50,680 --> 00:05:53,120
If she finds out I'm here, everything's ruined.

40
00:05:53,120 --> 00:05:54,280
I know.

41
00:05:54,280 --> 00:05:56,867
I'll try to get her out of the room
as fast as I can.

42
00:05:56,867 --> 00:05:59,847
I'll try. Just wait here.

43
00:06:09,840 --> 00:06:11,793
Stay here.

44
00:07:33,240 --> 00:07:36,280
<i>I've taken a look at the document
that you sent over.</i>

45
00:07:36,280 --> 00:07:39,640
<i>Pitcha's land is quite nice.</i>

46
00:07:39,640 --> 00:07:41,624
The concept is interesting.

47
00:07:41,624 --> 00:07:44,607
But we should explore other options too.

48
00:07:44,607 --> 00:07:48,707
<i>I'll have my people look into more locations.</i>

49
00:07:48,707 --> 00:07:52,274
Alright. We still have time.

50
00:07:52,274 --> 00:07:57,174
So in two months,

51
00:07:57,174 --> 00:08:02,899
once we finalize the price and location,
we can wrap up the purchase decision.

52
00:08:02,899 --> 00:08:06,767
Alright, that's all for now. Thank you, everyone.

53
00:08:06,767 --> 00:08:10,407
<i>That's it. Okay, see you next time.</i>

54
00:08:12,120 --> 00:08:14,767
Jack, stay a bit.

55
00:08:14,767 --> 00:08:16,474
I need to talk to you.

56
00:08:16,474 --> 00:08:18,234
Sure.

57
00:08:18,234 --> 00:08:21,240
How's the background check going?

58
00:08:22,420 --> 00:08:25,714
Pitcha comes from a well-off family.

59
00:08:25,714 --> 00:08:30,367
<i>Graduated from a top public university
with good grades.</i>

60
00:08:30,367 --> 00:08:33,114
No serious relationships.

61
00:08:33,114 --> 00:08:35,092
<i>And as far as I can tell,</i>

62
00:08:35,092 --> 00:08:39,094
her connection to Jay
is purely through coordinating this deal for you.

63
00:08:41,627 --> 00:08:45,627
Jay's land is really good.

64
00:08:45,627 --> 00:08:51,267
If we get it, it'll be our best project yet.

65
00:08:51,267 --> 00:08:54,454
And I'll fund it all myself.

66
00:08:54,454 --> 00:08:58,247
Meaning the other partners
must not find out about this.

67
00:08:58,247 --> 00:09:04,280
Understood, boss.
And how much are you planning to offer?

68
00:09:04,280 --> 00:09:08,354
Not yet. Still thinking.

69
00:09:08,354 --> 00:09:12,367
Jay said a lot of people have approached him
in the past.

70
00:09:12,367 --> 00:09:17,180
If he wanted to sell, he would've by now.

71
00:09:17,180 --> 00:09:20,247
We need a different way to persuade him.

72
00:09:20,247 --> 00:09:23,007
I'll figure something out.

73
00:09:23,007 --> 00:09:24,647
Got it.

74
00:09:28,987 --> 00:09:32,334
I should get to bed.
I have an early meeting tomorrow.

75
00:09:32,334 --> 00:09:34,007
I'll walk you out.

76
00:09:34,747 --> 00:09:41,327
But that meeting might relate to a question
you haven't answered yet,

77
00:09:41,327 --> 00:09:44,507
about how much you'd charge to come to Shanghai.

78
00:09:45,420 --> 00:09:49,094
How is my situation related to your meeting?

79
00:09:51,554 --> 00:09:57,382
My partners will be discussing land investment.

80
00:09:57,382 --> 00:10:00,362
Your land is at the top of my list.

81
00:10:01,520 --> 00:10:03,834
I'm not selling.

82
00:10:03,834 --> 00:10:08,287
Even if you take me to Shanghai and back,
I won't change my mind.

83
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:13,927
Before you, before Pitcha, others came asking too.

84
00:10:14,680 --> 00:10:20,567
It might sound naïve,
but my grandmother would never agree to sell.

85
00:10:24,518 --> 00:10:32,634
You know, people with ideals, dreamers,
they often miss out on good opportunities.

86
00:10:33,287 --> 00:10:38,180
They miss out
because they cling to what they intended.

87
00:10:39,107 --> 00:10:45,487
They miss what could be good for them, too.

88
00:10:47,227 --> 00:10:51,107
There are many ways to do business.

89
00:10:51,107 --> 00:10:57,914
In the end, you might not have to sell your land
but still make money.

90
00:11:22,767 --> 00:11:27,927
If you go to Shanghai,
you'll learn about all that.

91
00:11:30,914 --> 00:11:35,807
Think carefully. Opportunities don't come often.

92
00:11:37,614 --> 00:11:42,780
If you want to try, let me know before 10 AM.

93
00:12:24,034 --> 00:12:26,040
Hello, Pitcha?

94
00:12:26,040 --> 00:12:28,560
What time will you arrive?

95
00:12:28,560 --> 00:12:31,114
I'm on the morning flight.

96
00:12:31,114 --> 00:12:32,947
You're already here?

97
00:12:35,840 --> 00:12:37,140
Okay.

98
00:12:38,260 --> 00:12:43,347
Once you've unpacked,
come meet me at the riverside café.

99
00:12:50,460 --> 00:12:54,217
Hello, this is Pitcha. I checked in last night.

100
00:12:54,217 --> 00:12:58,247
Could you please move my belongings
to the room I originally booked?

101
00:12:58,247 --> 00:13:04,520
And please, don't let my friends know
that I checked in last night.

102
00:13:04,520 --> 00:13:07,207
Thank you very much.

103
00:13:11,194 --> 00:13:14,540
Stay calm, Pitcha. Stay calm.

104
00:13:18,307 --> 00:13:23,714
<i>In the end, you might not have to sell the land
and still earn money.</i>

105
00:13:23,714 --> 00:13:27,147
<i>If you go to Shanghai, you'll learn about that.</i>

106
00:13:27,147 --> 00:13:31,174
<i>Think carefully.
Opportunities like this don't come often.</i>

107
00:13:38,827 --> 00:13:43,647
This one's nice, full and ripe.

108
00:13:43,647 --> 00:13:46,367
You have an incoming call.

109
00:13:48,287 --> 00:13:49,547
Ji is calling.

110
00:13:49,547 --> 00:13:51,060
Ji is calling?

111
00:13:51,060 --> 00:13:53,107
What is it, my dear?

112
00:13:53,107 --> 00:13:54,520
<i>Hi, Grandma.</i>

113
00:13:54,520 --> 00:13:55,587
What are you doing?

114
00:13:55,587 --> 00:13:59,454
I'm watching them harvest vegetables.
They'll be sold at the evening market.

115
00:13:59,454 --> 00:14:03,074
We got a lot today, should fetch a good price.

116
00:14:03,074 --> 00:14:05,180
Why are you working so hard?

117
00:14:05,180 --> 00:14:09,527
It's not hard at all. I'm strong!

118
00:14:09,527 --> 00:14:14,880
Auntie Hom is here too.
She's happy we harvested a lot.

119
00:14:14,880 --> 00:14:17,623
Ji, auntie's going to be rich.

120
00:14:17,623 --> 00:14:20,607
<i>Next year the lychees should be ready for sale.</i>

121
00:14:20,607 --> 00:14:24,734
If they sell well,
I'll share the money with Grandma Jan too.

122
00:14:24,734 --> 00:14:29,374
<i>Once we get the lychees,
I'll send some to Bangkok.</i>

123
00:14:29,374 --> 00:14:34,194
I'll ship them by coach,
so you can share them with your friends.

124
00:14:34,194 --> 00:14:41,040
Giving others land to make a living,
everyone wins.

125
00:14:41,040 --> 00:14:43,840
That's good, Grandma.

126
00:14:43,840 --> 00:14:48,840
But please be careful
when you go to the market, okay?

127
00:14:49,860 --> 00:14:51,727
Walk slowly. Don't fall again, alright?

128
00:14:51,727 --> 00:14:54,460
And don't lift anything heavy.

129
00:14:54,460 --> 00:14:56,580
If I find out, I won't let you go again.

130
00:14:56,580 --> 00:15:01,994
Oh, stop scolding me!
I've got to bundle these veggies.

131
00:15:01,994 --> 00:15:03,314
Okay.

132
00:15:17,140 --> 00:15:18,767
Pitcha.

133
00:15:25,540 --> 00:15:27,660
Hello, Anita.

134
00:15:30,514 --> 00:15:33,327
I thought you wouldn't arrive until this evening.

135
00:15:33,327 --> 00:15:37,200
Just in case you wanted to view more properties.

136
00:15:37,200 --> 00:15:39,952
What time is your flight back to Bangkok tomorrow?

137
00:15:39,952 --> 00:15:41,140
In the afternoon.

138
00:15:41,140 --> 00:15:46,480
I'll check in at the hotel in the evening,
then dinner's on me.

139
00:15:46,480 --> 00:15:50,187
Then the next morning,
you'll take me to Suvarnabhumi?

140
00:15:51,132 --> 00:15:54,474
About the land in Sukhothai,
I'm still checking for you.

141
00:15:54,474 --> 00:15:55,640
Might not have the update in time
before you leave,

142
00:15:55,640 --> 00:15:58,127
but I'll send word as soon as I can.

143
00:15:59,780 --> 00:16:04,114
Are you interested in seeing any other locations?

144
00:16:05,936 --> 00:16:08,320
It's so-so.

145
00:16:08,320 --> 00:16:12,220
Is your land nice? Yes.

146
00:16:12,220 --> 00:16:14,560
But it's not the best.

147
00:16:14,560 --> 00:16:18,200
This morning, some of my partners liked it.

148
00:16:18,200 --> 00:16:22,600
Some said maybe we should check out
other options too.

149
00:16:22,600 --> 00:16:25,140
Do you have anything else?

150
00:16:25,140 --> 00:16:29,353
I have a plot on an island.
I go there every year. It's beautiful.

151
00:16:29,353 --> 00:16:32,147
It has a private beach and would be perfect.

152
00:16:32,147 --> 00:16:38,220
For a wellness project,
it's not ideal if we have to cross by boat.

153
00:16:38,220 --> 00:16:41,393
Too many limitations. Costs are high.

154
00:16:41,393 --> 00:16:43,087
That's true.

155
00:16:43,087 --> 00:16:49,300
Actually, some of my partners aren't too keen
on your land.

156
00:16:50,787 --> 00:16:56,000
But I'll make it happen
because I have the final say.

157
00:16:56,687 --> 00:16:58,867
Thank you so much, Anita.

158
00:16:58,867 --> 00:17:02,220
- So...
- I want you to be my exclusive land scout.

159
00:17:02,220 --> 00:17:04,480
Really?

160
00:17:04,480 --> 00:17:10,460
If you can convince Jay to come to Shanghai
with me for six months.

161
00:17:12,420 --> 00:17:14,593
Six months?

162
00:17:14,593 --> 00:17:17,277
I don't think he'll...

163
00:17:17,277 --> 00:17:20,373
I know you and Jay just met.

164
00:17:20,373 --> 00:17:23,520
You're just employer and contractor.

165
00:17:23,520 --> 00:17:27,293
And I've heard his schedule is packed every day.

166
00:17:27,293 --> 00:17:31,993
But still, you got him in a way
none of my competitors could.

167
00:17:31,993 --> 00:17:36,287
So I think you must have something
that makes Jay listen.

168
00:17:37,200 --> 00:17:42,600
Are you interested in him? Or his land?

169
00:17:46,340 --> 00:17:51,260
Both, Pitcha. They're both great. You've seen it.

170
00:17:54,638 --> 00:17:57,631
Or are you just afraid you'll lose Jay's land?

171
00:17:58,987 --> 00:18:01,647
I'm being fair, Pitcha.

172
00:18:01,647 --> 00:18:06,560
If, in the meantime, you speak with Jay's family
and they agree to let you act as his agent,

173
00:18:06,560 --> 00:18:08,900
then it's yours.

174
00:18:08,900 --> 00:18:11,993
But if I get there first, then sorry.

175
00:18:11,993 --> 00:18:14,847
When something's that good,
people will fight for it, right?

176
00:18:16,393 --> 00:18:19,307
But the part no one else has to fight over,
is this.

177
00:18:19,307 --> 00:18:26,867
You'll be my exclusive broker
if you can get Jay to go to Shanghai with me.

178
00:18:31,673 --> 00:18:34,148
I'll give you one month.

179
00:18:34,148 --> 00:18:37,240
I'll stall my partners until then.

180
00:18:37,240 --> 00:18:41,520
And if you get Jay on board, we'll work together.

181
00:18:41,520 --> 00:18:47,480
I'll sign purchase agreements for two
or three plots with you to build vacation homes.

182
00:18:47,480 --> 00:18:49,980
So this trip won't be a waste.

183
00:18:57,840 --> 00:19:01,000
Hey, did you catch Phanom Naga last night?
[Grandma Jan's Restaurant]

184
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:03,793
Wow, the naga was huge!

185
00:19:03,793 --> 00:19:07,607
- Of course I did. The battle was epic.
- So intense.

186
00:19:07,607 --> 00:19:09,280
Seriously.

187
00:19:09,280 --> 00:19:13,847
The male lead is so handsome,
both him and his brother.

188
00:19:13,847 --> 00:19:17,400
Totally agree. Super handsome.

189
00:19:17,400 --> 00:19:19,320
They've aired it multiple times already.

190
00:19:19,320 --> 00:19:21,393
But no matter how many times you watch,
it's still exciting.

191
00:19:21,393 --> 00:19:23,027
Totally.

192
00:19:23,027 --> 00:19:24,546
Oh, hello there.

193
00:19:24,546 --> 00:19:26,120
Hi, Auntie Jaew.

194
00:19:26,120 --> 00:19:27,720
Still here? Haven't gone home yet?

195
00:19:27,720 --> 00:19:32,096
I already came, went back, and now I'm back again.
I'll be heading home tomorrow.

196
00:19:32,096 --> 00:19:34,100
Do you still have any khao soi left?

197
00:19:34,100 --> 00:19:35,440
There's some.

198
00:19:35,440 --> 00:19:38,400
I thought there were no more customers,
and was about to close.

199
00:19:38,400 --> 00:19:39,493
You feel like eating?

200
00:19:39,493 --> 00:19:41,527
Go ahead and sit. I'll go heat it up.

201
00:19:41,527 --> 00:19:43,233
Let me help.

202
00:19:43,233 --> 00:19:46,427
Alright, come on into the kitchen.

203
00:19:52,613 --> 00:19:55,173
When are you coming back again after this trip?

204
00:19:55,173 --> 00:20:00,580
I'm not sure.
But I'll try to come back often for khao soi.

205
00:20:01,633 --> 00:20:06,573
Auntie Jaew, don't forget,
if anyone comes asking about buying the land,

206
00:20:06,573 --> 00:20:10,020
please think of me first, okay? Promise me.

207
00:20:10,020 --> 00:20:14,053
Oh girl, let's get your grandma
to agree to sell first.

208
00:20:14,053 --> 00:20:19,760
Ji probably won't sell easily either,
especially if it's a Chinese or a foreign buyer.

209
00:20:19,760 --> 00:20:22,193
That'll be tough.

210
00:20:22,193 --> 00:20:23,860
Really?

211
00:20:25,687 --> 00:20:30,873
Ji told me
that Chiang Mai is practically China now.

212
00:20:30,873 --> 00:20:35,233
They're buying up everything.
And Thais keep selling.

213
00:20:35,233 --> 00:20:36,760
Ji's afraid that one day,

214
00:20:36,760 --> 00:20:40,940
we'll be renting land from Chinese people
to grow our rice.

215
00:20:41,580 --> 00:20:44,640
And Pai, ever since it became a tourist town,

216
00:20:44,640 --> 00:20:47,693
the locals have had a harder life
in a different way.

217
00:20:47,693 --> 00:20:53,387
Nan is still quiet for now.
But honestly, business here isn't that great.

218
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:58,260
There's always good and bad to everything, dear.

219
00:20:59,567 --> 00:21:02,100
Oh, here it is.

220
00:21:05,617 --> 00:21:10,927
There's not much chicken left,
but the broth is super rich and flavorful.

221
00:21:10,927 --> 00:21:13,147
I'll give you a big bowl.

222
00:21:13,147 --> 00:21:14,313
Thank you.

223
00:21:21,960 --> 00:21:27,573
<i>My mother always said: Land lasts forever.</i>

224
00:21:27,573 --> 00:21:30,493
<i>You can't finish eating it,
even in your great-grandchildren's lifetime.</i>

225
00:21:30,493 --> 00:21:35,553
<i>But money? No matter how much you have,
if you don't know how to use it, it runs out fast.</i>

226
00:21:35,553 --> 00:21:38,260
<i>She always said that.</i>

227
00:21:38,260 --> 00:21:44,553
<i>But you know, having land is hard work.
Selling land is the easy route.</i>

228
00:21:44,553 --> 00:21:46,607
<i>It depends on how you see things.</i>

229
00:21:46,607 --> 00:21:51,967
<i>But Ji, he probably thinks like his grandma.
They've kept this place going a long time.</i>

230
00:21:51,967 --> 00:21:57,780
<i>If they ever sell, it'll probably be to you.
You're Thai too, after all.</i>

[Shanghai]

233
00:22:07,645 --> 00:22:09,455
Thank you both so much.

234
00:22:09,455 --> 00:22:11,558
Thank you as well.

235
00:22:13,817 --> 00:22:16,237
You could think about me once in a while,
you know.

236
00:22:17,433 --> 00:22:19,733
Safe travels.

237
00:22:28,896 --> 00:22:33,693
Think about my offer.
You've got my number. Let me know.

238
00:22:33,693 --> 00:22:37,340
If you're interested in what I proposed.

239
00:22:38,773 --> 00:22:42,300
And you, I'll be back in a month
to ask for your answer.

240
00:22:47,304 --> 00:22:50,231
- Bye-bye.
- Bye-bye.

241
00:22:56,040 --> 00:22:58,340
You could think about me once in a while too.

242
00:23:01,920 --> 00:23:06,660
Now that Anita's gone,
I probably won't get to see you again.

243
00:23:08,602 --> 00:23:09,987
Why?

244
00:23:09,987 --> 00:23:12,893
Well, are you going to come see me at Bar Smile?

245
00:23:14,780 --> 00:23:19,580
So if I don't go there,
we won't see each other again?

246
00:23:19,580 --> 00:23:23,980
No, we will. You have my number.

247
00:23:23,980 --> 00:23:28,207
I'm just not sure if you'll call.

248
00:23:39,147 --> 00:23:42,620
It was nice working with you, Mr. Jira.

249
00:23:48,754 --> 00:23:50,993
Can we be friends?

250
00:24:09,733 --> 00:24:11,873
You can let go of her hand now.

251
00:24:21,360 --> 00:24:25,660
Plew, please don't disappear on me, okay?

252
00:24:29,600 --> 00:24:32,580
We've gotten past being just acquaintances.

253
00:24:36,180 --> 00:24:38,087
Please don't vanish.

254
00:24:39,662 --> 00:24:41,282
I'm begging you.

255
00:24:46,540 --> 00:24:49,120
- Yes, Anita?
- <i>Hello, Pitcha.</i>

256
00:24:49,120 --> 00:24:54,760
I'm calling to remind you,
I want you to be my exclusive agent.

257
00:24:54,760 --> 00:25:00,160
If you can get Jay to come to Shanghai with me,
I want both the land and him.

258
00:25:00,160 --> 00:25:02,420
Do you understand?

259
00:25:02,420 --> 00:25:04,533
Yes. I understand.

260
00:25:08,232 --> 00:25:09,580
Plew.

261
00:25:09,580 --> 00:25:11,420
Plew.

262
00:25:19,907 --> 00:25:23,153
- Oh, Dad, where are you off to?
- You're home today?

263
00:25:23,153 --> 00:25:25,933
How are you?

264
00:25:25,933 --> 00:25:28,380
Where'd you just come back from? Sukhothai?

265
00:25:28,380 --> 00:25:31,547
Nan. And where are you going?

266
00:25:31,547 --> 00:25:34,367
Sujin just called,
invited me to play golf in Khao Yai.

267
00:25:34,367 --> 00:25:37,267
Just called a minute ago. Can't say no.

268
00:25:37,267 --> 00:25:40,440
I already told your mom, she said go.

269
00:25:40,440 --> 00:25:45,220
She even said
Sujin doesn't just invite anyone, you know.

270
00:25:45,220 --> 00:25:48,773
Oh, you're home! Perfect timing.

271
00:25:48,773 --> 00:25:51,580
Dad's leaving,
and now you're here to keep your mom company.

272
00:25:51,580 --> 00:25:53,693
- Hi, Mom.
- Hi, sweetie.

273
00:25:53,693 --> 00:25:55,860
Alright, I'm heading out. See you in two days.

274
00:25:55,860 --> 00:25:58,573
- Okay, Dad.
- Safe travels. Call me when you arrive.

275
00:25:58,573 --> 00:26:00,740
Will do. Thanks.

276
00:26:01,513 --> 00:26:03,453
- Call me when you arrive.
- Got it.

277
00:26:03,453 --> 00:26:05,900
- Bye-bye, Dad.
- Bye.

278
00:26:11,686 --> 00:26:15,273
And you? How are things?
You've been gone two weeks.

279
00:26:15,273 --> 00:26:17,353
Anything to show for it?

280
00:26:17,353 --> 00:26:21,942
Still waiting on the client's decision, Mom.

281
00:26:21,942 --> 00:26:24,073
Let me go upstairs first.

282
00:26:29,293 --> 00:26:34,727
Cha, so the land they're interested in,
it's in Sukhothai?

283
00:26:34,727 --> 00:26:37,520
Yes, they're still checking things,

284
00:26:37,520 --> 00:26:40,513
like who owns the surrounding plots
and what they plan to do with them.

285
00:26:40,513 --> 00:26:44,373
If they decide to buy, I'll probably have to
go back to Sukhothai to ask around again.

286
00:26:44,373 --> 00:26:48,400
Wow, sounds exhausting, so complicated.

287
00:26:48,400 --> 00:26:51,427
And all that traveling must've cost a lot.

288
00:26:51,427 --> 00:26:54,307
So how much did you spend this time?

289
00:26:54,307 --> 00:26:58,407
Not that much.
The client gave me some money up front.

290
00:26:58,407 --> 00:27:05,153
Oh? And if you don't manage to sell the land,
can you still keep the advance?

291
00:27:05,153 --> 00:27:09,040
Well, if I can't sell, I'll pay half of it.

292
00:27:09,040 --> 00:27:11,960
Exactly. That's what I was asking.

293
00:27:11,960 --> 00:27:15,940
If the deal doesn't go through,
how much will you be out?

294
00:27:16,573 --> 00:27:19,273
Well... A little over a million, Mom.

295
00:27:19,273 --> 00:27:20,933
What?

296
00:27:20,933 --> 00:27:25,873
Are you out of your mind?
You spent over a million just for a 10-day trip?

297
00:27:25,873 --> 00:27:28,520
And that million is just half the total?

298
00:27:28,520 --> 00:27:31,893
Where did all that money go?

299
00:27:31,893 --> 00:27:33,680
Did you eat gold instead of rice?

300
00:27:33,680 --> 00:27:34,907
Mom!

301
00:27:34,907 --> 00:27:39,567
Cha, you can't keep working like this.

302
00:27:39,567 --> 00:27:43,027
Working and losing money? That's not work.

303
00:27:43,027 --> 00:27:47,653
I don't want to meddle, I know it's your money.

304
00:27:47,653 --> 00:27:51,200
But it's a million!
Aren't you the least bit regretful?

305
00:27:51,200 --> 00:27:53,440
Even people wealthier than us think twice
about spending a few hundred.

306
00:27:53,440 --> 00:27:56,480
Mom, I'm exhausted.

307
00:27:56,480 --> 00:28:02,940
Can we talk about this tomorrow, please?
I'll explain everything, I promise.

308
00:28:10,987 --> 00:28:15,180
- This time she blew over a million.
- <i>What?</i>

309
00:28:15,180 --> 00:28:19,020
See? Anyone would shout like that.

310
00:28:19,020 --> 00:28:22,580
Who knows if she got scammed
by those party types or something.

311
00:28:22,580 --> 00:28:27,140
I think you should tell her to stop
and come work with me instead.

312
00:28:27,140 --> 00:28:31,367
Tell her I'll give her a percentage
from total sales.

313
00:28:31,367 --> 00:28:33,620
She could be earning
hundreds of thousands every month.

314
00:28:33,620 --> 00:28:37,700
And now, Laks' dad wants us
to open ten more branches.

315
00:28:37,700 --> 00:28:39,366
Right?

316
00:28:40,547 --> 00:28:45,320
I just don't get why you keep indulging her.
She won't take any income, just expenses.

317
00:28:45,320 --> 00:28:46,847
<i>Indulging?</i>

318
00:28:46,847 --> 00:28:48,767
I've said everything I could think of!

319
00:28:48,767 --> 00:28:53,307
It's you who should help talk her out
of this land-selling nonsense.

320
00:28:53,307 --> 00:28:56,980
If you don't help me,
then no one's going to help you at school either.

321
00:28:56,980 --> 00:29:00,433
So figure it out.

322
00:29:09,940 --> 00:29:12,102
Laks.

323
00:29:12,102 --> 00:29:13,267
What's up?

324
00:29:15,553 --> 00:29:19,800
About what we talked about the other day,
can we still go through with it?

325
00:29:20,813 --> 00:29:22,860
You mean the Sukhothai info?

326
00:29:22,860 --> 00:29:24,400
Yeah.

327
00:29:24,400 --> 00:29:29,727
I know it feels wrong,
but I honestly think it's the best for everyone.

328
00:29:31,367 --> 00:29:36,533
She still doesn't realize that
working with me isn't bad, and she'd earn money.

329
00:29:36,533 --> 00:29:39,547
Plus your dad wants to expand into the provinces.

330
00:29:39,547 --> 00:29:43,860
It suits her, right? Everything fits.

331
00:29:45,780 --> 00:29:51,200
And if she still wants to sell land on the side,
no one's going to stop her.

332
00:29:51,200 --> 00:29:53,780
Even Mom won't complain then.

333
00:29:55,207 --> 00:29:58,680
If you want me to keep doing stuff like this,

334
00:29:58,680 --> 00:30:00,813
can you at least try talking
to her again directly?

335
00:30:00,813 --> 00:30:05,473
- Laks.
- I'll stall the Sukhothai matter for you.

336
00:30:05,473 --> 00:30:07,780
You go talk to her again.

Did the rich Chinese lady tip you big?
Spill the secrets!

340
00:30:38,771 --> 00:30:41,553
Got nothing, ma'am.

341
00:30:42,787 --> 00:30:45,293
- Seriously?
- Yeah.

342
00:30:45,293 --> 00:30:52,907
She asked if I wanted a watch or whatever,
but I didn't want anything.

343
00:30:55,593 --> 00:30:58,793
Planning to be a monk or something?

344
00:30:58,793 --> 00:31:01,160
Dude, those watches aren't cheap.

345
00:31:01,160 --> 00:31:03,760
Could be worth hundreds of thousands,
even a million.

346
00:31:03,760 --> 00:31:07,287
Take it, you might need money someday,
and you can sell it then.

347
00:31:07,287 --> 00:31:10,500
You know what your problem is?

348
00:31:10,500 --> 00:31:16,340
Call it humility if you want,
but to me it sounds like foolishness.

349
00:31:17,660 --> 00:31:20,267
I just didn't want it.

350
00:31:20,267 --> 00:31:23,376
Fine, fine. Don't want it, don't take it.

351
00:31:23,376 --> 00:31:26,927
- I'll transfer your share.
- Nice.

352
00:31:26,927 --> 00:31:30,487
- And take a break for...
- Three days.

353
00:31:30,487 --> 00:31:32,113
Three?

354
00:31:32,113 --> 00:31:34,347
Make it five.

355
00:31:34,347 --> 00:31:37,267
Three's enough, my prince.

356
00:31:37,267 --> 00:31:38,900
Three days it is?

357
00:31:46,127 --> 00:31:48,940
- Hey...
- What?

358
00:31:50,460 --> 00:31:53,467
If I want to quit, I can just quit, right?

359
00:31:56,560 --> 00:31:59,980
Why? She offered to take care of you or something?

360
00:32:05,367 --> 00:32:07,727
You can quit if you want.

361
00:32:07,727 --> 00:32:09,713
I'm not gonna stop you.

362
00:32:10,760 --> 00:32:13,840
But is it okay?

363
00:32:13,840 --> 00:32:15,610
Not really, I guess.

364
00:32:15,610 --> 00:32:17,493
We haven't found anyone to replace you.

365
00:32:17,493 --> 00:32:21,547
If you stop showing up, it's going to hit us hard.

366
00:32:26,193 --> 00:32:27,440
How about this?

367
00:32:27,440 --> 00:32:30,373
If you're really quitting,
give us a three-month notice.

368
00:32:30,373 --> 00:32:32,720
And help train the kids.

369
00:32:32,720 --> 00:32:35,063
Teach them everything.

370
00:32:35,063 --> 00:32:38,740
Your charm, your tease, your act.

371
00:32:39,925 --> 00:32:43,052
Make sure I know we'll have a Jay 2 and Jay 3.

372
00:32:43,724 --> 00:32:46,440
So the bar can keep surviving.

373
00:32:46,440 --> 00:32:47,820
Okay?

374
00:32:52,162 --> 00:32:54,280
We'll see.

375
00:32:54,280 --> 00:32:55,907
I'll get going.

376
00:33:07,327 --> 00:33:10,167
- Whoa!
- Whoa! Are you an ex-snooker prodigy or what?

377
00:33:10,167 --> 00:33:11,827
- Amazing shot!
- Hey, Jay!

378
00:33:11,827 --> 00:33:13,492
- Hey.
- You're back?

379
00:33:15,414 --> 00:33:17,860
Looking rich there!

380
00:33:17,860 --> 00:33:20,060
Whoa, I can smell the wealth on you!

381
00:33:20,060 --> 00:33:22,533
- Nah...
- You've got an aura, man!

382
00:33:22,533 --> 00:33:24,487
Aura my ass, I just got my pay.

383
00:33:24,487 --> 00:33:26,127
- No way.
- Seriously?

384
00:33:26,127 --> 00:33:27,267
For real.

385
00:33:27,267 --> 00:33:29,753
No designer clothes?

386
00:33:29,753 --> 00:33:32,653
I went to Nan, what would I shop for?

387
00:33:32,653 --> 00:33:36,040
There are websites, man. Shop online.

388
00:33:36,040 --> 00:33:38,987
I think Gur's the master at that stuff.

389
00:33:38,987 --> 00:33:40,640
Don't bring me into this.

390
00:33:40,640 --> 00:33:42,220
Let's go eat. My treat.

391
00:33:42,220 --> 00:33:43,167
Let's go!

392
00:33:43,167 --> 00:33:46,400
- Nice!
- Aww, too bad. I can't take a day off now.

393
00:33:46,400 --> 00:33:51,560
- Jay's treating, though. Let's go!
- Can't today, really.

394
00:33:51,560 --> 00:33:55,120
Gur, you coming or what? Let Bew keep working.

395
00:33:57,477 --> 00:34:00,573
Today my regular client's here.

396
00:34:00,573 --> 00:34:02,447
Damn.

397
00:34:03,867 --> 00:34:05,753
Guess it's just the two of us then.

398
00:34:07,180 --> 00:34:09,253
So? Should I wait or what?

399
00:34:09,253 --> 00:34:12,273
Come on, Gur. You never take a day off!

400
00:34:13,700 --> 00:34:17,700
Hey Gur, your client's here.

401
00:34:18,814 --> 00:34:20,933
All set.

402
00:34:20,933 --> 00:34:24,307
Go, man. Let people work.

403
00:34:24,307 --> 00:34:26,493
Okay, I'm off. Catch you later.

404
00:34:26,493 --> 00:34:28,387
Bye.

405
00:34:32,293 --> 00:34:33,860
Well?

406
00:34:34,873 --> 00:34:38,873
Hey, I'm trying to work here.

407
00:34:38,873 --> 00:34:40,853
Right, right.

408
00:34:42,880 --> 00:34:44,640
This is so good.

409
00:34:45,372 --> 00:34:47,265
Then eat up.

410
00:34:48,579 --> 00:34:50,266
Are you treating?

411
00:34:51,567 --> 00:34:54,940
Hey, have you seen
that guest you met the other day again?

412
00:34:54,940 --> 00:34:58,000
Who? Laks?

413
00:34:58,000 --> 00:34:59,287
Yeah, saw him.

414
00:34:59,287 --> 00:35:01,000
Went out with his group.

415
00:35:01,000 --> 00:35:05,991
They always roll deep, more about fun than food.

416
00:35:05,991 --> 00:35:07,780
But get this, you won't believe it.

417
00:35:07,780 --> 00:35:13,153
Last week, I took a freelance gig
shooting pre-wedding stills.

418
00:35:13,153 --> 00:35:17,700
It's nothing special,
but when I saw the groom-to-be's face,

419
00:35:17,700 --> 00:35:20,767
I screamed in my head, holy shit!

420
00:35:20,767 --> 00:35:24,427
- No way.
- Yep. It was that guest of mine.

421
00:35:24,427 --> 00:35:27,867
Laks. In a wedding suit.

422
00:35:29,233 --> 00:35:30,627
Damn.

423
00:35:31,767 --> 00:35:33,647
What did you do?

424
00:35:33,647 --> 00:35:36,780
What else? Gave a polite wai and played it cool.

425
00:35:36,780 --> 00:35:38,733
- And him?
- He was even smoother than me.

426
00:35:38,733 --> 00:35:40,187
- Seriously?
- Yeah.

427
00:35:40,187 --> 00:35:42,307
Smooth as silk.

428
00:35:42,307 --> 00:35:44,740
He even grabbed my butt.

429
00:35:44,740 --> 00:35:47,700
- What the hell?
- Laks, seriously.

430
00:35:47,700 --> 00:35:49,787
He's gone too far.

431
00:35:51,673 --> 00:35:54,227
Whoa. This is crazy.

432
00:35:57,120 --> 00:35:58,907
Wait.

433
00:35:58,907 --> 00:36:03,400
So does that mean
you met the bride's little sister too?

434
00:36:03,400 --> 00:36:05,100
Pitcha, right?

435
00:36:05,100 --> 00:36:07,573
Yeah. How'd you know?

436
00:36:07,573 --> 00:36:10,313
She was the one who brought me to the location.

437
00:36:10,313 --> 00:36:13,800
- Really?
- I'm still in talks with her about venue details.

438
00:36:13,800 --> 00:36:15,087
So...

439
00:36:16,520 --> 00:36:18,300
What's she like?

440
00:36:20,280 --> 00:36:23,240
- Why are you asking?
- What's she like?

441
00:36:23,880 --> 00:36:29,120
Well, seems nicer than her sister.

442
00:36:29,120 --> 00:36:33,873
The sister's super moody, snobby, and spoiled.

443
00:36:33,873 --> 00:36:37,653
Like she'll only ever be sweet
to her husband or something.

444
00:36:37,653 --> 00:36:39,900
But the younger one doesn't seem like that.

445
00:36:42,030 --> 00:36:44,017
Do you know her?

446
00:36:45,160 --> 00:36:46,534
You know...

447
00:36:49,053 --> 00:36:52,447
- that day you saw me at the hotel?
- Yeah?

448
00:36:52,447 --> 00:36:54,107
She was there.

449
00:36:56,752 --> 00:36:58,753
Really?

450
00:36:58,753 --> 00:37:00,920
So she knows then...

451
00:37:01,908 --> 00:37:03,580
Yup.

452
00:37:03,580 --> 00:37:05,407
That's why I asked what she was like.

453
00:37:05,407 --> 00:37:08,560
She was really composed though.

454
00:37:08,560 --> 00:37:12,820
But thinking back,
she kind of looked at me like...

455
00:37:12,820 --> 00:37:15,120
Like she was sizing me up. A bit intense.

456
00:37:15,120 --> 00:37:17,073
Do you think Laks knows that she knows?

457
00:37:18,795 --> 00:37:21,340
Her sister's about to get married.

458
00:37:22,092 --> 00:37:24,533
I doubt she'd say anything.

459
00:37:24,533 --> 00:37:25,953
Yeah.

460
00:37:26,740 --> 00:37:28,731
Probably speechless.

461
00:37:29,880 --> 00:37:32,637
What can you do? It's a small world.

462
00:37:32,637 --> 00:37:34,347
So small.

463
00:37:46,067 --> 00:37:47,913
Thanks, this was really good.

464
00:37:47,913 --> 00:37:50,327
- See you! Bye.
- See you! Bye!

465
00:37:58,964 --> 00:38:00,630
Prang!

466
00:38:02,347 --> 00:38:04,180
What are you doing here?

467
00:38:08,480 --> 00:38:10,413
Something wrong?

468
00:38:10,413 --> 00:38:14,273
No, I just happened to be around.

469
00:38:14,960 --> 00:38:17,040
Just happened to be around?

470
00:38:17,040 --> 00:38:19,120
You live around here?

471
00:38:19,120 --> 00:38:22,627
Or your regular's place is nearby?

472
00:38:22,627 --> 00:38:26,307
Come on, it's not like that.

473
00:38:26,307 --> 00:38:28,620
Then what's with waiting around?

474
00:38:30,423 --> 00:38:33,850
I was just hungry.

475
00:38:36,527 --> 00:38:38,987
Then go get something to eat.

476
00:38:41,885 --> 00:38:43,951
You got food in your room?

477
00:38:50,438 --> 00:38:53,471
Every room has something to eat.

478
00:38:56,727 --> 00:38:58,527
So can I come up?

479
00:39:02,000 --> 00:39:03,740
Sure.

480
00:39:33,787 --> 00:39:36,740
Didn't think your place would be this tidy.

481
00:39:36,740 --> 00:39:40,107
It's not tidy. There's just nothing to mess it up.

482
00:39:41,087 --> 00:39:45,393
You hungry? I've got one bag of rad na. Want it?

483
00:39:45,393 --> 00:39:47,600
Yeah, thanks.

484
00:39:47,600 --> 00:39:49,147
Microwaving it now.

485
00:40:27,475 --> 00:40:29,735
Only two minutes?

486
00:40:32,377 --> 00:40:33,757
Yep.

487
00:40:35,657 --> 00:40:39,873
I used to heat it unevenly, so I Googled it.

488
00:40:39,873 --> 00:40:49,627
It said to microwave for two minutes, stir,
then do two more minutes.

489
00:40:50,360 --> 00:40:53,745
Otherwise it heats unevenly.

490
00:40:53,745 --> 00:40:58,260
Total time takes four minutes.

491
00:41:04,567 --> 00:41:06,780
Microwave expert over here.

492
00:41:40,693 --> 00:41:42,640
Four whole minutes, wow.

493
00:41:45,073 --> 00:41:47,273
Wanna do something while we wait?

494
00:41:53,387 --> 00:41:57,140
It's just four minutes, Gur.

495
00:42:38,807 --> 00:42:40,293
Hey, Gur.

496
00:42:40,293 --> 00:42:41,920
Gur.

497
00:42:42,720 --> 00:42:44,260
Gur.

498
00:43:09,740 --> 00:43:12,260
Want to eat the rad na?

499
00:43:14,493 --> 00:43:16,467
Wanna eat rad na?

500
00:43:36,040 --> 00:43:38,440
[Jira]

501
00:43:43,647 --> 00:43:46,393
Hello, Plew. Are you asleep?

502
00:43:46,393 --> 00:43:48,593
I'm already talking in my sleep.

503
00:43:49,520 --> 00:43:52,267
Wanna grab coffee tomorrow?

504
00:43:52,267 --> 00:43:54,340
<i>I've got three days off.</i>

505
00:43:56,127 --> 00:43:58,040
<i>How about a café with lots of trees?</i>

506
00:43:58,040 --> 00:44:00,973
Like forest or garden vibes.
You'd probably like that, right?

507
00:44:00,973 --> 00:44:04,093
Hold on, I haven't even said yes yet.

508
00:44:04,093 --> 00:44:06,160
Well, hurry and answer then.

509
00:44:06,160 --> 00:44:08,887
If you don't want coffee,
I can take you for something else.

510
00:44:08,887 --> 00:44:12,413
<i>Barbecue, shabu, noodles,</i>

511
00:44:12,413 --> 00:44:16,880
ice cream, bingsu, anything you want.

512
00:44:17,833 --> 00:44:20,660
I'm not free. Let's do it another time.

513
00:44:22,460 --> 00:44:26,793
Okay, no problem.
But if you change your mind, call me.

514
00:44:26,793 --> 00:44:29,193
I'm super available these days.

515
00:44:54,047 --> 00:44:55,427
Ji.

516
00:44:55,427 --> 00:44:57,633
Jira.

517
00:44:57,633 --> 00:45:01,680
- Yeah?
- Where've you been? Haven't seen you in days.

518
00:45:02,327 --> 00:45:07,267
Nowhere, just work,
and I stopped by home for a bit.

519
00:45:07,267 --> 00:45:10,358
Tomorrow I'm making tamarind shrimp.

520
00:45:10,358 --> 00:45:13,547
Can you pick up some shrimp for me?

521
00:45:13,547 --> 00:45:17,533
I thought you called to check in on me
because you care.

522
00:45:17,533 --> 00:45:18,947
Turns out you just want me to buy groceries again.

523
00:45:18,947 --> 00:45:24,127
I'll share it with you once it's done.
One kilo of nice white shrimp.

524
00:45:24,127 --> 00:45:25,400
Okay, okay.

525
00:45:25,400 --> 00:45:26,920
Where are you going now?

526
00:45:26,920 --> 00:45:29,080
You look fresh.

527
00:45:29,080 --> 00:45:32,080
- Did you get laser treatment or something?
- Nope.

528
00:45:32,080 --> 00:45:33,613
Looks like I've got a date.

529
00:45:33,613 --> 00:45:35,287
What's going on?

530
00:45:35,287 --> 00:45:37,120
Honestly, I asked someone out.

531
00:45:37,120 --> 00:45:40,700
She didn't come, so I thought I'd go wait for her.

532
00:45:40,700 --> 00:45:41,880
Maybe she'll show up.

533
00:45:41,880 --> 00:45:43,320
Want me to go wait with you? Let's go.

534
00:45:43,320 --> 00:45:46,407
No thanks. You just swing your arms like that.
It suits you better.

535
00:45:46,407 --> 00:45:48,305
I'll go buy the shrimp.

536
00:45:48,305 --> 00:45:50,967
I'm tired of swinging already.

537
00:45:50,967 --> 00:45:52,120
White shrimp, okay?

538
00:45:52,120 --> 00:45:53,313
- White shrimp.
- White shrimp.

539
00:45:53,313 --> 00:45:55,960
Definitely white shrimp.
Other kinds are too expensive.

540
00:45:56,930 --> 00:45:59,693
- Hope you don't get stood up.
- Alright.

541
00:45:59,693 --> 00:46:02,213
- I'm off.
- Bye.

542
00:46:05,307 --> 00:46:08,400
Let me take care of it, okay?

543
00:46:12,780 --> 00:46:14,360
Oh, Plearn.

544
00:46:14,360 --> 00:46:15,713
You're home too?

545
00:46:15,713 --> 00:46:18,680
Yeah, taking the day off.

546
00:46:18,680 --> 00:46:22,520
Good timing. We both want to talk to you.

547
00:46:22,520 --> 00:46:24,380
It's about your school, right?

548
00:46:24,380 --> 00:46:28,580
Well yeah, why else? Why the tone?

549
00:46:28,580 --> 00:46:33,413
Mom, she just came down.
Let her eat first. It's not that urgent.

550
00:46:33,413 --> 00:46:38,007
Family stuff always comes second, huh?

551
00:46:38,007 --> 00:46:39,720
I haven't even said anything yet.

552
00:46:39,720 --> 00:46:43,360
I just asked
what I was about to get ganged up on for.

553
00:46:43,360 --> 00:46:48,753
There you go again
with your "the world doesn't love me" sarcasm.

554
00:46:48,753 --> 00:46:51,673
Mom, I'll talk to her myself.

555
00:46:51,673 --> 00:46:53,100
Come.

556
00:47:03,127 --> 00:47:05,220
I'm having problems with Laks.

557
00:47:05,881 --> 00:47:08,027
What's going on?

558
00:47:11,120 --> 00:47:12,800
His dad.

559
00:47:12,800 --> 00:47:16,400
He's not okay with me
not giving him a straight answer.

560
00:47:16,400 --> 00:47:18,647
About what?

561
00:47:18,647 --> 00:47:21,387
Expanding branches to other provinces.

562
00:47:22,267 --> 00:47:24,747
Cha, I don't think I can handle it.

563
00:47:24,747 --> 00:47:28,060
When money's involved, I don't trust anyone.

564
00:47:28,060 --> 00:47:32,233
I've been putting him off,
and now his dad's upset.

565
00:47:32,233 --> 00:47:34,040
But they're going
to open their own branches anyway.

566
00:47:34,040 --> 00:47:36,113
Why is he mad at you?

567
00:47:36,113 --> 00:47:38,913
Because we're planning
to open in big malls in major cities.

568
00:47:38,913 --> 00:47:43,447
We need something to draw people in,
and my tutoring school can do that.

569
00:47:43,447 --> 00:47:46,700
Parents drop off their kids
and shop while they wait.

570
00:47:46,700 --> 00:47:50,740
Do you know
I've secured the best locations everywhere?

571
00:47:50,740 --> 00:47:53,613
It's like having guaranteed business.

572
00:47:55,007 --> 00:47:57,587
So why are you telling me this?

573
00:47:57,587 --> 00:48:03,880
I've got no one else to help.
I want you to help me. Just for a while.

574
00:48:05,200 --> 00:48:09,160
Please, Cha. Help oversee things. Help me manage.

575
00:48:09,160 --> 00:48:13,620
I'll take care of lodging and travel.

576
00:48:15,867 --> 00:48:22,780
Plearn, I have my own work.
I can't help you that much.

577
00:48:25,300 --> 00:48:28,040
Sorry, but I have to be honest.

578
00:48:29,273 --> 00:48:32,980
From what I see,
your work doesn't look very solid.

579
00:48:33,960 --> 00:48:41,113
Plearn, what you have and who you are
doesn't give you the right to judge others.

580
00:48:41,113 --> 00:48:47,213
My job might not earn as much,
but I'm happy with it.

581
00:48:47,213 --> 00:48:52,887
Maybe I'm not as accomplished overall,
but I'm okay.

582
00:48:52,887 --> 00:48:58,020
This "okay" you speak of, do others think so too?

583
00:48:59,813 --> 00:49:05,460
- I don't care how others see me.
- By others, I mean family.

584
00:49:05,460 --> 00:49:08,247
Dad, Mom, me.

585
00:49:08,247 --> 00:49:10,540
We're all worried about you.

586
00:49:10,540 --> 00:49:13,220
You're this old and still living at home.

587
00:49:13,220 --> 00:49:18,013
Because I want to be with them.
Mom always says she's lonely.

588
00:49:18,013 --> 00:49:20,600
When exactly are you ever home?

589
00:49:20,600 --> 00:49:25,253
In what way are you keeping Mom company?
Don't use Mom as an excuse, Cha.

590
00:49:25,253 --> 00:49:28,740
I left because I felt like
Mom didn't want me there.

591
00:49:28,740 --> 00:49:30,260
Like everything I did was wrong.

592
00:49:30,260 --> 00:49:32,200
- So I thought...
- That's enough!

593
00:49:32,200 --> 00:49:35,180
Just going on and on with the drama, huh, Cha?

594
00:49:47,780 --> 00:49:53,587
Come work with me, Cha.
It's basically a family business.

595
00:49:53,587 --> 00:49:58,660
The more branches we expand,
the better it is for everyone.

596
00:49:58,660 --> 00:50:02,360
Doing it together is a win-win, Cha.

597
00:50:09,540 --> 00:50:11,180
Win-win?

598
00:50:11,180 --> 00:50:14,193
But Plearn, I'm not you.

599
00:50:25,344 --> 00:50:27,367
I'm going to move out, Mom.

600
00:50:27,367 --> 00:50:31,438
Wait, Cha. That's not the issue.
Don't act like a child.

601
00:50:31,438 --> 00:50:33,700
Let's talk this through reasonably.

602
00:50:36,267 --> 00:50:37,867
Cha!

603
00:50:37,867 --> 00:50:39,740
Cha!

604
00:50:39,740 --> 00:50:41,180
Hey!

605
00:50:50,660 --> 00:50:53,180
Cha, wait!

606
00:50:53,960 --> 00:50:56,507
Gosh, this kid.

607
00:51:00,177 --> 00:51:04,033
<i>From what I see,
your work doesn't look very solid.</i>

608
00:51:05,209 --> 00:51:08,100
<i>This okay you speak of, do others think so too?</i>

609
00:51:08,100 --> 00:51:10,580
<i>Dad, Mom, me.</i>

610
00:51:16,807 --> 00:51:18,713
<i>We're all worried about you.</i>

611
00:51:18,713 --> 00:51:20,967
<i>You're this old and still living at home.</i>

612
00:51:20,967 --> 00:51:25,480
<i>Family stuff always comes second, huh?</i>

613
00:52:09,140 --> 00:52:10,647
Hello?

614
00:52:10,647 --> 00:52:12,480
Hello, where are you?

615
00:52:13,393 --> 00:52:15,160
Are you okay?

616
00:52:15,160 --> 00:52:18,467
I'm at the place I told you about earlier.

617
00:52:18,467 --> 00:52:20,253
Share your location with me.

618
00:52:20,253 --> 00:52:22,720
Okay, okay, I'll send it.

619
00:52:48,480 --> 00:52:50,093
Jay!

620
00:52:50,093 --> 00:52:51,567
Da!

621
00:52:52,553 --> 00:52:54,433
It really is you!

622
00:52:54,433 --> 00:52:57,613
I missed you.

623
00:52:58,540 --> 00:53:02,460
Who are you here with?
Oh, don't tell me you're working.

624
00:53:02,460 --> 00:53:06,720
I begged and begged you
to come have coffee with me,

625
00:53:06,720 --> 00:53:08,873
and you never would.

626
00:53:09,927 --> 00:53:11,787
I made plans with a friend today.

627
00:53:11,787 --> 00:53:13,680
- Really?
- Yup.

628
00:53:13,680 --> 00:53:16,980
It's my day off. I've got plans.

629
00:53:16,980 --> 00:53:19,320
Then how about dinner tonight?

630
00:53:19,320 --> 00:53:21,333
I'll make it special.

631
00:53:21,333 --> 00:53:22,560
Please?

632
00:53:22,560 --> 00:53:24,933
Please?

633
00:53:27,587 --> 00:53:29,360
Please, okay?

634
00:53:29,360 --> 00:53:31,140
I really can't.
