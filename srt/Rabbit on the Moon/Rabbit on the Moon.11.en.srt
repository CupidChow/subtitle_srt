1
00:01:16,320 --> 00:01:18,660
You took her to Nan with you, didn't you?

2
00:01:28,827 --> 00:01:30,900
Yes.

3
00:01:30,900 --> 00:01:33,063
To a place like that?

4
00:01:33,063 --> 00:01:36,060
What if someone saw you?

5
00:01:40,389 --> 00:01:43,022
Pitcha's also in Nan, you know.

6
00:01:43,758 --> 00:01:49,700
Honestly, Nan's not exactly a big province.

7
00:01:49,700 --> 00:01:52,287
What if someone does see you?

8
00:01:57,938 --> 00:02:03,987
Don't think just because I found out,
that others won't too.

9
00:02:03,987 --> 00:02:06,287
That's not what I think.

10
00:02:08,433 --> 00:02:11,320
You need to manage your image.

11
00:02:11,320 --> 00:02:13,800
Don't you care about preserving it at all?

12
00:02:13,800 --> 00:02:17,407
Am I the only one who has to try?

13
00:02:17,407 --> 00:02:19,780
Are you sure it's just about my image?

14
00:02:19,780 --> 00:02:22,700
Who's the one who refuses to divorce?

15
00:02:22,700 --> 00:02:26,093
And you couldn't even find a better mistress?

16
00:02:26,093 --> 00:02:33,153
So at least I wouldn't be humiliated when
people find out who you chose to replace me with.

17
00:02:39,747 --> 00:02:43,493
Why are you looking at your wife like that?

18
00:02:46,407 --> 00:02:50,907
Whatever you're doing, just finish it.

19
00:02:50,907 --> 00:02:54,287
Then we can go out for dinner
and pretend, with love,

20
00:02:54,287 --> 00:02:58,607
like no one knows you don't love me anymore.

21
00:03:11,513 --> 00:03:14,467
There's something I think you should know.

22
00:03:15,760 --> 00:03:18,467
I saw Pitcha in Nan.

23
00:03:19,407 --> 00:03:24,547
I'm going to find time
to talk to her and explain everything.

24
00:03:25,200 --> 00:03:30,106
Kotchakorn, I'm sorry it ended up like this.

25
00:03:30,106 --> 00:03:36,243
But can you please reconsider the divorce?

26
00:03:36,243 --> 00:03:44,500
We could do it quietly, live apart quietly,
no drama, no outsiders involved, please.

27
00:03:53,627 --> 00:04:00,013
When I walk out that door,
don't forget to smile at me, okay?

28
00:04:00,013 --> 00:04:06,500
Because the last time we walked out together...

29
00:04:08,127 --> 00:04:10,873
you didn't even look at me.

30
00:04:33,633 --> 00:04:35,213
What would you like to eat?

31
00:04:35,213 --> 00:04:38,593
- Up to you, you choose.
- No, you choose.

32
00:04:38,593 --> 00:04:41,400
- How about our usual spot?
- Sounds good.

33
00:04:41,400 --> 00:04:44,533
- Alright, we'll head out now.
- Okay.

34
00:06:09,647 --> 00:06:11,487
Yes, Laks?

35
00:06:11,487 --> 00:06:14,067
<i>I'm going camping with some friends.</i>

36
00:06:14,067 --> 00:06:15,887
When?

37
00:06:15,887 --> 00:06:17,413
<i>Today.</i>

38
00:06:17,413 --> 00:06:18,887
What?

39
00:06:18,887 --> 00:06:22,907
<i>They've been planning it for a while,
but I just decided.</i>

40
00:06:22,907 --> 00:06:27,647
<i>Sorry it's so sudden.
But I'll see you in three or four days, okay?</i>

41
00:06:27,647 --> 00:06:29,720
<i>Call me anytime.</i>

42
00:06:29,720 --> 00:06:32,233
<i>Although there might be some spots without signal.</i>

43
00:06:32,233 --> 00:06:34,220
<i>Love you, Plearn.</i>

44
00:07:14,320 --> 00:07:15,360
[Mom]

45
00:07:20,287 --> 00:07:21,773
Yes, Mom?

46
00:07:21,773 --> 00:07:25,260
Cha, when are you free to visit me?

47
00:07:27,040 --> 00:07:28,712
I've been busy lately.

48
00:07:28,712 --> 00:07:31,373
<i>I'm trying to close two client deals.</i>

49
00:07:31,373 --> 00:07:33,780
When will you be free?

50
00:07:33,780 --> 00:07:36,634
Probably in the next day or two.

51
00:07:36,634 --> 00:07:38,807
Okay, I'll be waiting.

52
00:07:38,807 --> 00:07:45,320
If you can't come, I'll come see you. That's all.

53
00:07:47,473 --> 00:07:48,633
Okay.

54
00:08:01,007 --> 00:08:03,093
Cheers.

55
00:08:03,093 --> 00:08:04,680
Cheers.

56
00:08:05,707 --> 00:08:08,747
So, let's deal on this.

57
00:08:08,747 --> 00:08:10,667
You're welcome.

58
00:08:10,667 --> 00:08:13,867
Do you want to have another drink to celebrate?

59
00:08:15,080 --> 00:08:17,180
Just the two of us?

60
00:08:19,147 --> 00:08:22,573
Our project has so many people involved.

61
00:08:22,573 --> 00:08:25,660
Should we have another drink at a bar, or...

62
00:08:26,807 --> 00:08:30,180
should we go to your room, or my room?

63
00:08:46,313 --> 00:08:48,900
Maybe another time.

64
00:09:03,253 --> 00:09:04,313
Good night.

65
00:09:04,313 --> 00:09:06,333
See you next time.

66
00:09:42,160 --> 00:09:43,260
What's up?

67
00:09:43,260 --> 00:09:46,860
<i>All contract revisions are done.
Just waiting for you to return and sign.</i>

68
00:09:46,860 --> 00:09:50,007
<i>Missing Shanghai yet?</i>

69
00:09:50,007 --> 00:09:51,744
I miss Jay more.

70
00:09:51,744 --> 00:09:53,250
<i>Oh wow.</i>

71
00:09:55,813 --> 00:10:00,253
Oh right, get a van to pick me up when I return.
I've got loads of stuff.

72
00:10:00,253 --> 00:10:02,120
<i>Got it.</i>

73
00:10:11,827 --> 00:10:14,440
<i>Don't bring me anything.</i>

74
00:10:28,820 --> 00:10:30,653
Yes?

75
00:10:30,653 --> 00:10:34,020
So? Forgotten about me yet?

76
00:10:34,020 --> 00:10:35,373
Having fun?

77
00:10:35,373 --> 00:10:39,323
<i>Are you coming to join me? Stay longer.</i>

78
00:10:39,323 --> 00:10:42,913
Nope. I have to go back to Shanghai anyway.

79
00:10:42,913 --> 00:10:47,540
And don't go buying me a ton of stuff,
we've talked about this.

80
00:10:47,540 --> 00:10:49,013
You're so clueless.
(In Chinese)

81
00:10:49,013 --> 00:10:51,780
Hey, I understand that.

82
00:10:56,200 --> 00:10:57,580
Jay...

83
00:10:58,920 --> 00:11:03,427
What if I really fall in love with you?

84
00:11:03,427 --> 00:11:05,793
<i>What would I do?</i>

85
00:11:05,793 --> 00:11:08,820
<i>I know this is just a job to you.</i>

86
00:11:10,200 --> 00:11:12,713
But I tried. I really did.

87
00:11:12,713 --> 00:11:15,620
<i>I tried not to feel anything.</i>

88
00:11:15,620 --> 00:11:18,573
<i>I went far away.</i>

89
00:11:18,573 --> 00:11:21,387
Partied every night.

90
00:11:21,387 --> 00:11:24,100
- But still...
- Anita.

91
00:11:25,807 --> 00:11:29,667
I understand everything you're saying.

92
00:11:29,667 --> 00:11:35,120
I just told someone else
the same thing you're telling me now.

93
00:11:36,140 --> 00:11:38,020
Pitcha, right?

94
00:11:38,840 --> 00:11:40,807
<i>Was it Pitcha?</i>

95
00:11:41,640 --> 00:11:45,712
You sound kind of drunk.
Maybe you should get some rest?

96
00:11:45,712 --> 00:11:50,205
Just answer me. Is it Pitcha? Why is that so hard?

97
00:11:51,567 --> 00:11:53,020
Ann...

98
00:11:53,787 --> 00:11:57,033
When I get back,
there's something I want to talk to you about.

99
00:11:57,033 --> 00:12:00,687
And I don't want to do it over the phone.

100
00:12:00,687 --> 00:12:04,487
Tell me who you love. Who is it?

101
00:12:04,487 --> 00:12:09,220
I can love whoever I want.
We'll talk when I'm back.

102
00:12:09,220 --> 00:12:12,913
<i>And what I need to talk about,
it's not even about who I love.</i>

103
00:12:12,913 --> 00:12:15,827
Yes, it is. To me, it matters!

104
00:12:15,827 --> 00:12:17,633
We'll talk when I get back.

105
00:12:17,633 --> 00:12:18,833
<i>Goodbye.</i>

106
00:12:18,833 --> 00:12:21,253
Jay... Jay!

107
00:12:46,320 --> 00:12:47,760
Yes, Mr. Anan?

108
00:12:47,760 --> 00:12:50,705
- <i>Is this a good time?</i>
- Sure.

109
00:12:50,705 --> 00:12:54,185
<i>So, actually I'd like to cancel
our agreement for now.</i>

110
00:12:55,120 --> 00:12:58,227
But we were just about to sign the contract.
Everything was flowing well.

111
00:12:58,227 --> 00:13:00,307
Is something wrong? We can talk it out.

112
00:13:00,307 --> 00:13:02,760
<i>There's just been a change of plans, that's all.</i>

113
00:13:02,760 --> 00:13:05,073
<i>Apologies for wasting your time.</i>

114
00:13:05,073 --> 00:13:07,260
Hello?

115
00:13:13,453 --> 00:13:16,307
Hello, Miss Joy! I was just about to call you.

116
00:13:16,307 --> 00:13:18,387
I wanted to ask what time you'd like me
to pick you up tomorrow?

117
00:13:18,387 --> 00:13:22,500
<i>Miss Pitcha, actually my boss decided
not to go see your property.</i>

118
00:13:22,500 --> 00:13:28,627
<i>He got a referral from a friend of a friend
who's an agent, I think they're close.</i>

119
00:13:28,627 --> 00:13:30,314
A referral from who?

120
00:13:30,314 --> 00:13:32,473
<i>A friend of a friend of my boss.</i>

121
00:13:32,473 --> 00:13:34,313
<i>He just called a moment ago.</i>

122
00:13:34,313 --> 00:13:39,380
<i>Sorry about this.
I'll call you back with more details soon.</i>

123
00:13:39,380 --> 00:13:41,867
Miss Joy?

124
00:13:46,873 --> 00:13:50,093
Goi, both Mr. Anan and Miss Joy's boss
canceled on us this morning at the same time.

125
00:13:50,093 --> 00:13:52,453
I don't think that's a coincidence.

126
00:13:52,453 --> 00:13:56,813
Can you check who they went with?
I'm heading to the office now.

127
00:14:08,240 --> 00:14:10,420
Got it.

128
00:14:12,993 --> 00:14:16,567
Looks like they both ended up
at Heaven Land by Jim.

129
00:14:16,567 --> 00:14:18,227
Is the agent Chinese?

130
00:14:18,227 --> 00:14:21,540
Taiwanese. Married to a Thai local.

131
00:14:22,473 --> 00:14:23,200
Sounds familiar.

132
00:14:23,200 --> 00:14:25,735
I think they mostly sell to Chinese buyers,

133
00:14:25,735 --> 00:14:28,247
but they're small-scale.

134
00:14:29,580 --> 00:14:33,293
Can you also find out
who that friend of a friend is?

135
00:14:33,293 --> 00:14:35,180
On it.

136
00:14:50,487 --> 00:14:52,700
Thanks.

137
00:14:55,280 --> 00:15:00,127
The room's cleaned up, go ahead and unpack.

138
00:15:00,127 --> 00:15:01,507
Let's go.

139
00:15:16,280 --> 00:15:17,587
Sorry it's a bit messy.

140
00:15:17,587 --> 00:15:19,660
Yeah, it is messy.

141
00:15:19,660 --> 00:15:23,040
- Do you ever wash your shoes?
- I do.

142
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:30,060
You can take the bedroom, I'll sleep on the couch.

143
00:15:30,060 --> 00:15:34,173
The bathroom's shared. I've already cleaned it.

144
00:15:34,173 --> 00:15:38,988
And the closet, we'll have to share.

145
00:15:38,988 --> 00:15:43,167
The issue is it's in the bedroom,
so I'll need to go in and out.

146
00:15:43,167 --> 00:15:45,940
As long as you're not naked, it's fine.

147
00:15:46,660 --> 00:15:48,107
Gur.

148
00:15:49,119 --> 00:15:52,772
I can only chip in 3,000 baht
for water and electricity.

149
00:15:53,793 --> 00:15:57,027
But I promise I won't stay longer than six months.

150
00:15:57,027 --> 00:15:58,573
What?

151
00:15:58,573 --> 00:16:01,000
That's all I can afford.

152
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:03,627
I'll try to get back on my feet
as soon as possible.

153
00:16:03,627 --> 00:16:05,205
You're not okay with it?

154
00:16:05,205 --> 00:16:06,680
I'm not okay.

155
00:16:06,680 --> 00:16:09,520
- Why?
- I'm not okay with just six months.

156
00:16:09,520 --> 00:16:13,480
- Wait, what?
- I thought you were moving in for good.

157
00:16:13,480 --> 00:16:17,373
I don't care about the bills.
You still have to support your sibling.

158
00:16:17,373 --> 00:16:22,967
And you're trying to get out of being an escort.
Why would I take your money?

159
00:16:22,967 --> 00:16:26,200
Hold up. Let's break this down.

160
00:16:26,200 --> 00:16:29,593
You thought I was moving in forever?

161
00:16:29,593 --> 00:16:31,120
What do you mean?

162
00:16:31,120 --> 00:16:33,293
I'm not here to be your girlfriend.

163
00:16:33,293 --> 00:16:35,753
- But you...
- Hey!

164
00:16:35,753 --> 00:16:39,093
Or did you think I'd sleep with you
in exchange for rent?

165
00:16:39,093 --> 00:16:42,771
God, no! That's not what I meant at all, I swear.

166
00:16:42,771 --> 00:16:44,033
Gur!

167
00:16:44,033 --> 00:16:45,970
I mean...

168
00:16:46,735 --> 00:16:50,233
- Maybe not?
- Gur, be serious.

169
00:16:53,660 --> 00:16:55,087
Prang.

170
00:16:56,498 --> 00:16:58,805
You know I like you.

171
00:17:00,673 --> 00:17:01,707
I know.

172
00:17:01,707 --> 00:17:03,940
And you like me too, don't you?

173
00:17:04,693 --> 00:17:08,193
Of course you do. You've brought your stuff here.
You're sleeping in my room.

174
00:17:08,193 --> 00:17:11,080
Why wouldn't you like me? Right?

175
00:17:11,080 --> 00:17:13,833
Yeah, I do.

176
00:17:13,833 --> 00:17:16,700
But I'm not going to sleep with you.

177
00:17:16,700 --> 00:17:19,620
Not until I've found my footing again on my terms.

178
00:17:21,813 --> 00:17:24,527
Okay. Got it.

179
00:17:25,240 --> 00:17:26,900
I'll wait.

180
00:17:29,193 --> 00:17:32,658
Oh, and don't worry about utilities or anything.

181
00:17:32,658 --> 00:17:35,472
I'll pay for everything. Even your pads.

182
00:17:35,472 --> 00:17:36,899
Jeez!

183
00:17:37,833 --> 00:17:42,090
And this room? Stay for as long as you want.

184
00:17:42,090 --> 00:17:44,517
Okay, I'll go clean up.

185
00:18:13,327 --> 00:18:15,100
- Peekaboo!
- Whoa!

186
00:18:15,100 --> 00:18:17,333
What?

187
00:18:17,333 --> 00:18:19,200
- Hey.
- Yeah?

188
00:18:19,200 --> 00:18:20,860
I'm hungry.

189
00:18:20,860 --> 00:18:23,120
Well then, order something to eat!

190
00:18:23,120 --> 00:18:27,993
Let me treat you.
As a thank-you for helping unpack.

191
00:18:29,873 --> 00:18:31,940
I want to eat...

192
00:18:32,647 --> 00:18:34,700
Rad na.

193
00:18:38,440 --> 00:18:40,640
No way, not having that.

194
00:18:41,653 --> 00:18:44,240
Fine, grilled chicken with sticky rice then.

195
00:18:46,453 --> 00:18:48,360
Exactly, just get what you actually want.

196
00:18:48,360 --> 00:18:50,100
But I do want rad na!

197
00:18:50,100 --> 00:18:51,673
Gur!

198
00:18:51,673 --> 00:18:53,587
I'm not eating rad na with you.

199
00:18:53,587 --> 00:18:56,920
Not for at least six months. Got it?

200
00:18:59,207 --> 00:19:01,847
Fine! I'll have pad see ew instead.

201
00:19:22,367 --> 00:19:24,893
I'm off to work now.

202
00:19:26,720 --> 00:19:29,220
Aren't you going to say something?

203
00:19:35,373 --> 00:19:37,580
Hope you get big tips!

204
00:19:37,580 --> 00:19:40,740
Amen.

205
00:19:40,740 --> 00:19:42,780
I'll hurry back, okay?

206
00:19:44,407 --> 00:19:49,647
Hey! You can come back whenever you want,
why are you even telling me?

207
00:19:54,320 --> 00:19:55,760
[Smile]

208
00:20:36,707 --> 00:20:38,473
This guy's cute.

209
00:20:38,473 --> 00:20:40,080
Gur! Gur!

210
00:20:40,080 --> 00:20:41,489
Gur!

211
00:20:41,489 --> 00:20:44,200
That customer's a big spender, Gur.

212
00:20:44,953 --> 00:20:46,940
You handle it.

213
00:20:47,873 --> 00:20:49,551
Hey!

214
00:20:49,551 --> 00:20:53,371
He's looking.

215
00:21:40,300 --> 00:21:42,700
You're really getting the hang of performing now.

216
00:21:42,700 --> 00:21:44,840
So, how much did you make?

217
00:21:44,840 --> 00:21:52,147
Well, the generous lady gave over 20,000,
and another table gave almost 20,000 too.

218
00:21:52,147 --> 00:21:54,738
Altogether, just over 40,000.

219
00:21:55,440 --> 00:21:58,573
Oh hey, there's my guy.

220
00:21:58,573 --> 00:22:03,027
One kiss, one hug, over 20,000 baht right there.

221
00:22:03,027 --> 00:22:04,827
That's all you needed?

222
00:22:04,827 --> 00:22:07,467
Boss, it's not like I'm working it.

223
00:22:07,467 --> 00:22:10,813
- I just don't want to sell myself.
- Huh?

224
00:22:11,600 --> 00:22:14,147
Because I already belong to someone.

225
00:22:16,524 --> 00:22:18,720
You and Maprang?

226
00:22:18,720 --> 00:22:20,427
Yeah, something like that.

227
00:22:20,427 --> 00:22:23,067
But we haven't really defined
the relationship yet.

228
00:22:23,993 --> 00:22:25,780
I just want to take care of her.

229
00:22:26,680 --> 00:22:29,113
Good.

230
00:22:29,113 --> 00:22:33,780
I think you two understand each other better
than most couples here.

231
00:22:33,780 --> 00:22:39,020
I've seen you and Maprang go back and forth
for a year now.

232
00:22:42,347 --> 00:22:45,460
Nah, I'll just head home tonight.

233
00:22:45,460 --> 00:22:48,347
Made enough money. Maprang's probably waiting.

234
00:22:50,280 --> 00:22:54,667
Everyone needs rest, boss.
Gotta detox the liver. Health first.

235
00:22:54,667 --> 00:22:56,567
You sure you're resting your liver?

236
00:22:56,567 --> 00:22:58,680
- My liver.
- Oh, okay.

237
00:22:58,680 --> 00:23:00,560
- Okay. Go, go!
- I'm off.

238
00:23:00,560 --> 00:23:03,902
- See you.
- You've changed a lot too, you know.

239
00:23:03,902 --> 00:23:05,973
Honeymoon phase, boss.

240
00:23:05,973 --> 00:23:09,500
- Yeah.
- I'll go look after my customers now.

241
00:23:09,500 --> 00:23:10,920
Go on, then!

242
00:23:10,920 --> 00:23:12,900
- Alright.
- Give it your all. Twenty grand more tonight.

243
00:23:12,900 --> 00:23:14,520
You got it, boss.

244
00:23:20,060 --> 00:23:22,500
Hey, Jay!

245
00:23:45,268 --> 00:23:46,913
What's up? Why are you back so soon?

246
00:23:46,913 --> 00:23:48,960
Just here for a day or two.

247
00:23:48,960 --> 00:23:50,986
You look better.

248
00:23:50,986 --> 00:23:52,240
A little.

249
00:23:52,240 --> 00:23:54,760
I made a lot tonight,
didn't even have to do anything shady.

250
00:23:54,760 --> 00:23:56,287
Damn.

251
00:23:56,287 --> 00:23:59,100
Heard you've got a roommate now.

252
00:23:59,100 --> 00:24:01,367
- Helping the kid out, that's all. Nothing more.
- Oh yeah?

253
00:24:01,367 --> 00:24:03,700
Yeah. I've gotta go. See ya!

254
00:24:03,700 --> 00:24:05,648
- See you!
- Catch you later.

255
00:24:05,648 --> 00:24:08,107
Hey, wait!

256
00:24:08,107 --> 00:24:10,867
Before you leave, let's grab a meal together.

257
00:24:10,867 --> 00:24:11,987
Sure.

258
00:24:11,987 --> 00:24:14,013
- Call me, okay?
- I will.

259
00:24:14,013 --> 00:24:15,580
See ya.

260
00:24:21,580 --> 00:24:23,540
Hello.

261
00:24:29,801 --> 00:24:31,541
I'm out.

262
00:24:36,493 --> 00:24:38,593
You look better, you know.

263
00:24:39,406 --> 00:24:41,173
How so?

264
00:24:41,173 --> 00:24:44,253
Like when you first came in here.

265
00:24:44,253 --> 00:24:46,113
But now you look richer.

266
00:24:46,113 --> 00:24:48,307
- For real?
- Yeah.

267
00:24:49,193 --> 00:24:54,020
Like... you don't belong
to this world anymore.

268
00:24:56,213 --> 00:24:58,340
You're really quitting, huh?

269
00:25:01,140 --> 00:25:03,020
Yeah, boss.

270
00:25:05,653 --> 00:25:08,973
Good. I'm happy for you, man.

271
00:25:11,300 --> 00:25:13,620
Gur's also getting his act together.

272
00:25:13,620 --> 00:25:15,940
Yeah, I can see that.

273
00:25:15,940 --> 00:25:18,107
He asked Maprang to move in with him.

274
00:25:18,107 --> 00:25:21,340
It's nice having someone
to come home to after work.

275
00:25:21,340 --> 00:25:23,920
- Really nice.
- True.

276
00:25:25,713 --> 00:25:29,467
You're not quitting
because you fell for a client, right?

277
00:25:29,467 --> 00:25:31,513
No.

278
00:25:31,513 --> 00:25:33,933
But the client fell for me.

279
00:25:36,040 --> 00:25:42,330
Like... the more we spent time together,
the more she couldn't keep it together.

280
00:25:42,330 --> 00:25:45,900
But honestly, she's really sweet.

281
00:25:45,900 --> 00:25:48,740
I just don't feel the same way.

282
00:25:48,740 --> 00:25:52,346
I'm going back to cancel the contract.

283
00:25:52,346 --> 00:25:56,100
But you'll get a smaller cut, boss.
Are you okay with that?

284
00:25:56,100 --> 00:25:59,940
Jay, I don't force anyone to do it.

285
00:26:00,920 --> 00:26:04,687
Especially if they've fallen that hard for you,
better to cut it clean.

286
00:26:04,687 --> 00:26:06,593
Karma, man.

287
00:26:16,093 --> 00:26:19,640
Thanks for everything, boss.

288
00:26:19,640 --> 00:26:21,553
[Smile]

289
00:26:21,553 --> 00:26:23,653
I've learned a lot from you.

290
00:26:25,233 --> 00:26:28,273
So... what now?

291
00:26:28,273 --> 00:26:30,740
I'm going home.

292
00:26:30,740 --> 00:26:33,200
I'm thinking of starting a farm.

293
00:26:33,200 --> 00:26:37,380
Maybe a guesthouse, home stay, tourist spot...

294
00:26:37,380 --> 00:26:40,140
I'm not sure yet.

295
00:26:41,239 --> 00:26:43,612
Depends on the money.

296
00:26:44,412 --> 00:26:48,420
At first I wanted to save up more
before starting anything.

297
00:26:48,420 --> 00:26:50,593
But now I've changed my mind.

298
00:26:50,593 --> 00:26:54,232
I'll start with what I've got.

299
00:26:54,232 --> 00:26:56,154
Can I invest a little?

300
00:26:56,803 --> 00:26:58,487
Are you serious?

301
00:27:00,047 --> 00:27:03,153
Of course. If it's you, I'd say yes.

302
00:27:03,153 --> 00:27:08,320
I don't have much either,
but I want to try something new.

303
00:27:15,573 --> 00:27:17,387
Alright, I'm off.

304
00:27:17,387 --> 00:27:19,574
Yeah.

305
00:27:19,574 --> 00:27:20,507
Thanks.

306
00:27:20,507 --> 00:27:23,380
- Hope you get rich!
- Get rich!

307
00:27:23,380 --> 00:27:25,300
- Bye.
- Bye.

308
00:27:32,407 --> 00:27:34,680
Sukhumvit 34, please.

309
00:27:34,680 --> 00:27:36,820
- How much?
- Forty baht.

310
00:27:42,607 --> 00:27:44,887
Here you go.

311
00:27:44,887 --> 00:27:47,853
- You're Whale, right?
- Yes, that's me.

312
00:27:48,707 --> 00:27:50,740
Hi there.

313
00:27:50,740 --> 00:27:52,160
Let's go.

314
00:28:43,957 --> 00:28:47,750
<i>I'll be in Bangkok for two more days
if you want to meet.</i>

315
00:28:52,320 --> 00:28:54,360
[Plew]

316
00:28:56,820 --> 00:28:59,133
<i>We need to talk.</i>

317
00:28:59,133 --> 00:29:01,571
You're still up?

318
00:29:01,571 --> 00:29:05,731
<i>Yeah. I can't sleep. We need to talk right now.</i>

319
00:29:06,427 --> 00:29:08,807
I'm outside your building.

320
00:29:08,807 --> 00:29:10,253
<i>Huh?</i>

321
00:29:11,940 --> 00:29:13,713
What are you doing here?

322
00:29:13,713 --> 00:29:15,533
Well...

323
00:29:17,613 --> 00:29:19,707
You sound stressed.

324
00:29:19,707 --> 00:29:22,020
Is something wrong?

325
00:29:31,593 --> 00:29:35,853
One of my clients suddenly canceled
the purchase agreement.

326
00:29:35,853 --> 00:29:38,653
He said a friend of a friend
recommended a different land agent.

327
00:29:38,653 --> 00:29:41,573
And that friend of a friend is Anita.

328
00:29:41,573 --> 00:29:45,193
What do you think that means?
Is she upset with me or something?

329
00:29:45,193 --> 00:29:47,700
Are you sure this has to do with Anita?

330
00:29:47,700 --> 00:29:51,260
I'm not sure.
That's why I'm asking for your help to find out.

331
00:29:51,260 --> 00:29:56,020
I mean, to cancel so abruptly like this,
it must be a price war, right?

332
00:29:56,020 --> 00:30:00,460
And that other land agent, they know Anita.

333
00:30:01,433 --> 00:30:03,820
Do you think this is about commission?

334
00:30:03,820 --> 00:30:08,347
I didn't even get to talk to him
about how much they're giving.

335
00:30:08,347 --> 00:30:12,453
Calm down. Don't let your mind spiral right now.

336
00:30:12,453 --> 00:30:15,033
I'll look into it.

337
00:30:15,033 --> 00:30:19,435
Sorry to disturb you.
That deal was worth nearly a hundred million.

338
00:30:19,435 --> 00:30:21,720
I worked so hard to close it.

339
00:30:21,720 --> 00:30:27,467
Site visits, meals, cases of wine,
and then suddenly they don't want to sign?

340
00:30:28,878 --> 00:30:32,078
Just take it easy. You'll figure it out.

341
00:30:34,134 --> 00:30:37,993
I just want to understand what happened
so I can handle it properly.

342
00:30:37,993 --> 00:30:40,800
I don't want this to happen again.

343
00:30:56,380 --> 00:30:58,900
If I find out anything, I'll tell you right away.

344
00:31:00,600 --> 00:31:02,880
Actually, there's something else.

345
00:31:02,880 --> 00:31:06,780
You might not want to know,
but I want to tell you.

346
00:31:09,673 --> 00:31:12,220
I've quit working as a host.

347
00:31:14,680 --> 00:31:19,620
I'm going back to Shanghai
to cancel my contract with Anita.

348
00:31:20,507 --> 00:31:22,353
Then I'm heading back to Nan.

349
00:31:23,027 --> 00:31:26,340
I've already said goodbye
to Tiwa and everyone at the bar.

350
00:31:29,627 --> 00:31:33,827
Honestly, I want to thank you.

351
00:31:34,593 --> 00:31:36,424
For what?

352
00:31:36,424 --> 00:31:41,653
You were part of the reason
I decided to quit so soon.

353
00:31:47,539 --> 00:31:52,300
Everything just clicked. You gave me motivation.

354
00:31:52,300 --> 00:31:56,727
I saved some money. I learned a lot from Anita.

355
00:31:56,727 --> 00:32:00,180
She taught me so much.

356
00:32:01,531 --> 00:32:05,627
When I went back to Nan,
my grandma looked much older.

357
00:32:05,627 --> 00:32:10,260
She seemed tired, so I want to be with her.

358
00:32:11,034 --> 00:32:13,461
And when you go back, what will you do?

359
00:32:14,914 --> 00:32:17,800
I'll do something with the land.

360
00:32:17,800 --> 00:32:19,247
Farming.

361
00:32:19,247 --> 00:32:21,220
Build a guesthouse.

362
00:32:22,020 --> 00:32:23,987
Open a café or a shop.

363
00:32:23,987 --> 00:32:26,933
Whatever it takes, I won't starve.

364
00:32:26,933 --> 00:32:30,560
Do you even know how to do all that?

365
00:32:32,209 --> 00:32:33,812
I'll learn.

366
00:32:33,812 --> 00:32:37,052
I didn't know how to dance at first either,
but I learned.

367
00:32:45,388 --> 00:32:49,433
Honestly, my land is beautiful.

368
00:32:49,433 --> 00:32:52,887
There are mountains, water, everything.

369
00:32:53,567 --> 00:32:57,380
Things I never noticed before.

370
00:33:01,707 --> 00:33:06,647
Sometimes, just believing it's enough is enough.

371
00:33:06,647 --> 00:33:10,773
Yeah, and it makes me feel richer in time too.

372
00:33:10,773 --> 00:33:15,967
I'll have time to wake up and cook rice
for my grandma, without rushing.

373
00:33:15,967 --> 00:33:18,747
That alone is amazing.

374
00:33:19,440 --> 00:33:23,853
Being with someone you love brings peace.

375
00:33:32,067 --> 00:33:35,687
What's wrong? Why are you crying?

376
00:33:35,687 --> 00:33:37,580
Nothing.

377
00:33:37,580 --> 00:33:40,620
Nothing? You're crying.

378
00:33:41,267 --> 00:33:43,060
It's just...

379
00:33:44,127 --> 00:33:46,440
I hate the word peace.

380
00:33:46,440 --> 00:33:47,667
Huh?

381
00:33:51,733 --> 00:33:57,300
My dad had a mistress
because of that word "peace".

382
00:34:00,393 --> 00:34:05,580
I saw him in Nan with some plain-looking woman.

383
00:34:06,367 --> 00:34:09,113
They've been together for ten years.

384
00:34:11,353 --> 00:34:14,327
Because she gave him peace.

385
00:34:17,640 --> 00:34:20,240
It felt awful.

386
00:34:22,182 --> 00:34:24,549
What does that even mean?

387
00:34:26,373 --> 00:34:29,893
Does that mean the rest of us weren't his peace?

388
00:34:31,000 --> 00:34:34,625
My mom? My sister?

389
00:34:34,625 --> 00:34:36,700
What were we then?

390
00:34:39,173 --> 00:34:41,340
Hey, slow down.

391
00:34:41,340 --> 00:34:44,640
I don't think your dad meant it that way.

392
00:34:45,960 --> 00:34:49,847
You know what?

393
00:34:51,353 --> 00:35:01,340
I used to think I was the only one
in the family who saw the full picture.

394
00:35:02,515 --> 00:35:04,695
You know what I mean?

395
00:35:06,043 --> 00:35:08,930
Everyone else looked so successful.

396
00:35:11,567 --> 00:35:14,387
I was the only one who was a mess.

397
00:35:15,040 --> 00:35:17,300
Alone in a dark room.

398
00:35:21,900 --> 00:35:25,700
But no one was actually happy
with that so-called success.

399
00:35:28,307 --> 00:35:32,500
Not one person had peace.

400
00:35:34,060 --> 00:35:37,140
But you know what? They made that choice.

401
00:35:38,377 --> 00:35:43,124
They chose to look perfect, not to be at peace.

402
00:35:44,052 --> 00:35:48,764
Even if you told them,
"This is nice. This feels peaceful",

403
00:35:48,764 --> 00:35:51,273
they wouldn't come.

404
00:35:54,073 --> 00:36:01,007
In a family, people don't always live
in the same emotional zone.

405
00:36:01,800 --> 00:36:06,886
Caring from a distance, being there when needed.
That's enough.

406
00:36:23,953 --> 00:36:28,580
You look tired and sleepy. Want to go to bed?

407
00:36:33,508 --> 00:36:36,388
Come on. I'll walk you to bed.

408
00:36:53,960 --> 00:36:56,793
I'll call and wake you up mid-morning.

409
00:37:06,400 --> 00:37:08,500
You want me to stay?

410
00:37:11,453 --> 00:37:14,360
Okay. Let me turn off the lights.

411
00:37:36,133 --> 00:37:37,753
Goodnight.

412
00:38:39,440 --> 00:38:40,640
[Mr. Wasu]

413
00:38:44,267 --> 00:38:46,033
Who's calling so early?

414
00:38:46,033 --> 00:38:48,580
Forget it. I'll call back later.

415
00:38:54,440 --> 00:38:56,160
[Mom]

416
00:38:57,033 --> 00:38:58,800
My mom.

417
00:38:59,933 --> 00:39:01,187
Yes, Mom?

418
00:39:01,187 --> 00:39:03,260
<i>Cha, are you awake yet?</i>

419
00:39:03,260 --> 00:39:05,047
Yes.

420
00:39:05,047 --> 00:39:06,753
<i>Have you eaten yet?</i>

421
00:39:06,753 --> 00:39:08,847
Not yet. I just woke up.

422
00:39:08,847 --> 00:39:13,453
Perfect! I'm right outside your door with coffee,

423
00:39:13,453 --> 00:39:15,000
<i>and famous croissants.</i>

424
00:39:15,000 --> 00:39:17,333
Open up, I'm at the door.

425
00:39:18,640 --> 00:39:22,454
<i>Cha, hurry! It's heavy, I might drop everything.</i>

426
00:39:22,454 --> 00:39:23,907
Mom!

427
00:39:23,907 --> 00:39:26,713
Mom, just a second, I'm in the bathroom.

428
00:39:26,713 --> 00:39:27,760
My mom's here.

429
00:39:27,760 --> 00:39:29,241
<i>Cha.</i>

430
00:39:29,241 --> 00:39:31,420
Just five minutes, okay?

431
00:39:32,133 --> 00:39:34,626
My mom's here.

432
00:39:34,626 --> 00:39:36,567
What do we do?

433
00:39:36,567 --> 00:39:38,800
Hide this stuff.

434
00:39:42,280 --> 00:39:44,060
Hide in there.

435
00:39:50,693 --> 00:39:52,393
Cha!

436
00:39:56,494 --> 00:39:58,413
Coming, Mom!

437
00:39:58,413 --> 00:40:00,507
Hurry up.

438
00:40:03,260 --> 00:40:08,893
I've been waiting forever.
I brought so many snacks.

439
00:40:15,787 --> 00:40:19,440
This place looks nice. How much is the rent?

440
00:40:19,440 --> 00:40:22,385
Mom, how did you get here?

441
00:40:22,385 --> 00:40:25,074
Well, you told me where you live, didn't you?

442
00:40:25,074 --> 00:40:28,180
Even if it seems like I'm not listening, I am.

443
00:40:28,180 --> 00:40:30,740
My daughter moved out of the house.

444
00:40:30,740 --> 00:40:33,340
I should know where she's staying.

445
00:40:36,280 --> 00:40:38,880
What room is this? Let me see.

446
00:40:38,880 --> 00:40:40,933
It's the bedroom.

447
00:40:40,933 --> 00:40:43,013
Oh, the bedroom.

448
00:40:43,778 --> 00:40:47,393
Looks cozy.

449
00:40:47,393 --> 00:40:49,987
Didn't make the bed again, Cha?

450
00:40:49,987 --> 00:40:52,200
I just woke up, Mom.

451
00:41:03,487 --> 00:41:05,700
Nothing in here.

452
00:41:09,547 --> 00:41:11,353
What's this room?

453
00:41:13,547 --> 00:41:16,433
Oh, it's the bathroom.

454
00:41:16,433 --> 00:41:18,158
It's pretty spacious.

455
00:41:18,838 --> 00:41:21,787
Mom, what did you bring? I'm actually hungry.

456
00:41:21,787 --> 00:41:26,913
Well, good thing I brought food.
You didn't stock the fridge at all!

457
00:41:26,913 --> 00:41:30,153
Come, have coffee and croissants.

458
00:41:33,800 --> 00:41:36,240
Look, I brought croissants.

459
00:41:36,240 --> 00:41:39,913
- Oh, nice.
- And here's your favorite coffee.

460
00:41:39,913 --> 00:41:43,053
Everything looks delicious.

461
00:41:43,053 --> 00:41:48,553
Mom, I want to go buy some clothes,
something more formal.

462
00:41:48,553 --> 00:41:51,814
- Could you help me pick something out?
- Of course.

463
00:41:51,814 --> 00:41:54,339
Then should we head out now?

464
00:41:54,339 --> 00:41:57,933
I have to meet a client this evening,
so I need to get ready.

465
00:41:57,933 --> 00:42:00,093
- Let's go.
- Wait, Cha.

466
00:42:00,880 --> 00:42:02,793
You're in such a hurry...

467
00:42:02,793 --> 00:42:05,220
Are you hiding something from me?

468
00:42:07,593 --> 00:42:10,027
Is there anything you want to tell me?

469
00:42:13,705 --> 00:42:15,940
No.

470
00:42:15,940 --> 00:42:17,627
It's just that...

471
00:42:18,947 --> 00:42:21,018
I know.

472
00:42:21,018 --> 00:42:22,620
Huh?

473
00:42:24,053 --> 00:42:27,260
I know about you seeing your father with Araya.

474
00:42:32,820 --> 00:42:35,280
You've known about it for a while?

475
00:42:37,662 --> 00:42:43,215
Your father actually did a pretty good job
keeping it quiet.

476
00:42:44,653 --> 00:42:52,320
And Araya, well, she's the kind of mistress
who doesn't like showing off.

477
00:42:52,320 --> 00:42:54,068
She knows how to stay in her place.

478
00:42:54,068 --> 00:42:56,033
Snacks for everyone!

479
00:42:56,033 --> 00:42:58,767
Here you go.

480
00:42:58,767 --> 00:43:00,680
Here.

481
00:43:00,680 --> 00:43:02,607
Let's share.

482
00:43:10,540 --> 00:43:12,467
You're new?

483
00:43:12,467 --> 00:43:13,793
Yes.

484
00:43:13,793 --> 00:43:16,253
Do you like curry?

485
00:43:19,787 --> 00:43:21,387
I can eat it.

486
00:43:21,387 --> 00:43:24,007
Mr. Kitti loves curry.

487
00:43:24,007 --> 00:43:26,520
I bring it here often.

488
00:43:26,520 --> 00:43:28,900
I'll bring extra next time.

489
00:43:31,080 --> 00:43:32,427
Sure.

490
00:43:33,960 --> 00:43:40,040
Honestly, I never wanted my daughters
to find out about this.

491
00:43:40,747 --> 00:43:45,960
But I guess... it's better that you saw it.

492
00:43:45,960 --> 00:43:48,800
If it were Plearn, the family would've exploded.

493
00:43:49,839 --> 00:43:52,599
You haven't told Plearn yet, right?

494
00:43:56,440 --> 00:44:00,680
Good. Then don't.

495
00:44:00,680 --> 00:44:04,180
I don't think she can handle it.

496
00:44:04,180 --> 00:44:11,445
Plus she just got married,
and just started a new family.

497
00:44:11,445 --> 00:44:15,005
I don't want her starting off with a bad attitude
about things like this.

498
00:44:16,233 --> 00:44:21,420
And if this got back to Laks's parents somehow...

499
00:44:22,587 --> 00:44:25,400
they might look down on our family.

500
00:44:27,953 --> 00:44:29,413
Mom...

501
00:44:32,080 --> 00:44:35,967
I'm fine. I'm really okay.

502
00:44:39,313 --> 00:44:41,267
Excuse me.

503
00:44:41,267 --> 00:44:43,100
Sorry to bother you.

504
00:44:47,187 --> 00:44:50,373
Could the man who stayed over last night
please move his car?

505
00:44:50,373 --> 00:44:53,507
It's blocking a resident who needs to get to work.

506
00:44:53,507 --> 00:44:55,207
A man?

507
00:44:55,207 --> 00:44:58,340
Yes, the man from last night.

508
00:44:58,340 --> 00:45:01,507
Oh, okay. Just a minute.

509
00:45:01,507 --> 00:45:03,180
Who?

510
00:45:07,949 --> 00:45:10,980
A friend slept over, Mom.

511
00:45:10,980 --> 00:45:12,980
A friend? Really?

512
00:45:12,980 --> 00:45:15,200
Yes, really. A friend.

513
00:45:15,200 --> 00:45:16,613
And...

514
00:45:17,627 --> 00:45:20,047
Where's this friend now?

515
00:45:20,047 --> 00:45:21,853
Well...

516
00:45:23,053 --> 00:45:27,473
If he's really a friend,
then why are you hiding him?

517
00:45:27,473 --> 00:45:29,926
Why don't I see him?

518
00:45:29,926 --> 00:45:33,320
It's just that I didn't want to
make you uncomfortable.

519
00:45:33,320 --> 00:45:34,849
Why would I be uncomfortable?

520
00:45:34,849 --> 00:45:39,313
If he's just a friend, then tell him to come out.
People are being inconvenienced.

521
00:45:39,313 --> 00:45:43,460
And I'd really like to see
what this male friend looks like.

522
00:45:45,535 --> 00:45:49,269
Please hurry.
The resident is already late for work.

523
00:45:59,653 --> 00:46:06,747
Not just any male friend... but a male escort.
