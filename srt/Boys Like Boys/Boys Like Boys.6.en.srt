1
00:00:00,400 --> 00:00:01,300
(Previously)
Let's open it together.

2
00:00:01,400 --> 00:00:02,500
Oh my god.

3
00:00:03,567 --> 00:00:04,533
Okay.

4
00:00:04,767 --> 00:00:06,767
There will be someone
leaving the cabin tomorrow night.

5
00:00:06,867 --> 00:00:09,167
Please seize the chance
to date tomorrow at noon.

6
00:00:10,967 --> 00:00:14,233
I couldn't sleep well last night

7
00:00:14,333 --> 00:00:15,800
because of the news they revealed yesterday

8
00:00:15,900 --> 00:00:17,400
that someone would be leaving.

9
00:00:19,167 --> 00:00:20,167
Here it comes.

10
00:00:20,300 --> 00:00:21,400
(Rule/If it is your last day here...
select one member you'd like to date the most and send it back to the crew)

11
00:00:21,500 --> 00:00:23,133
Such a joyful chime.

12
00:00:29,600 --> 00:00:34,000
(Only two groups of people can go on a date today)

13
00:00:38,333 --> 00:00:40,100
(Talking is not allowed before the result announcement
Tension is brewing in the air...)

14
00:00:40,200 --> 00:00:42,633
I chose NIO for the first round, anyway.

15
00:00:42,733 --> 00:00:43,767
(Eri chose NIO)
because I always have been

16
00:00:43,867 --> 00:00:45,967
the one that chose him all along.

17
00:00:49,033 --> 00:00:51,900
I think, being in the same room with Guan-Yu

18
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:55,733
has definitely deepened a little the dynamic between us.

19
00:00:55,833 --> 00:00:57,667
Plus, we also discussed

20
00:00:57,767 --> 00:00:59,633
the option we chose yesterday.

21
00:01:01,067 --> 00:01:02,467
You were my only choice.

22
00:01:02,833 --> 00:01:03,700
Seriously?

23
00:01:04,067 --> 00:01:05,233
I'm blushing.

24
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:10,133
(Would NIO choose Guan-Yu...)
There probably won't be anyone else

25
00:01:12,767 --> 00:01:15,933
(anguish)

26
00:01:18,033 --> 00:01:19,467
But I'm scared that if I tell you this

27
00:01:19,567 --> 00:01:20,633
- you'll be stressed.
- No, not at all

28
00:01:20,733 --> 00:01:23,233
I think everything's cool
Let's take it easy.

29
00:01:23,333 --> 00:01:24,467
If you want to get to know someone better

30
00:01:24,567 --> 00:01:25,600
please go meet him

31
00:01:25,700 --> 00:01:28,600
I won't stop you from doing it

32
00:01:28,700 --> 00:01:31,567
I was wondering
whether I want to explore other options

33
00:01:31,667 --> 00:01:33,567
to meet other new fellow members

34
00:01:33,667 --> 00:01:35,800
or I want to choose Bobo and Shih-Feng

35
00:01:35,900 --> 00:01:37,967
or the people I have more feelings toward.

36
00:01:38,067 --> 00:01:41,567
Like Bobo and Gino, whom I know better.

37
00:01:44,800 --> 00:01:47,033
I'm hesitating whether
I should choose Guan-Yu and Bobo.

38
00:01:47,133 --> 00:01:51,533
For Bobo, I want to tell him

39
00:01:51,967 --> 00:01:55,733
that we can be really good friends

40
00:01:55,833 --> 00:01:57,600
after this whole show is over.

41
00:01:57,700 --> 00:02:01,533
Because I don't know
what's the best time to tell him this.

42
00:02:08,833 --> 00:02:13,133
(The crew announced the result for the first round)

43
00:02:23,200 --> 00:02:26,200
(Some people seem to receive the second text...)

44
00:02:26,300 --> 00:02:28,033
Apparently, NIO didn't choose me.

45
00:02:28,133 --> 00:02:30,100
So two more people have chosen me

46
00:02:30,200 --> 00:02:32,333
I get to make another decision again

47
00:02:32,433 --> 00:02:34,667
which means I get to choose
for the second round.

48
00:02:34,767 --> 00:02:37,233
Either it's Bobo or Shih-Feng.

49
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:41,400
(Question/Why did you choose Eri?)
It's like we've known each other forever.

50
00:02:41,500 --> 00:02:43,100
This nostalgia between us has always been there

51
00:02:43,200 --> 00:02:44,667
since the very first day.

52
00:02:44,767 --> 00:02:45,767
However

53
00:02:45,867 --> 00:02:47,700
I've never gone on a date with him before

54
00:02:47,800 --> 00:02:51,067
so I'd like to choose Eri this time.

55
00:02:54,467 --> 00:02:57,600
(Question/Why did you choose Eri?)
Even though he's some kind of imaginary enemy to me

56
00:02:57,700 --> 00:02:59,033
he really offers me that steady sense

57
00:02:59,133 --> 00:03:00,433
of comfiness.

58
00:03:00,533 --> 00:03:02,200
Once I heard whatever interactions

59
00:03:02,300 --> 00:03:05,033
between him and NIO, I was out of there

60
00:03:05,133 --> 00:03:06,200
I kind of feel bad about him

61
00:03:06,300 --> 00:03:09,300
because I seemed to run away
the minute after I heard what he said.

62
00:03:09,400 --> 00:03:10,033
(On the night yesterday)

63
00:03:10,133 --> 00:03:10,733
Good night

64
00:03:10,833 --> 00:03:12,800
I won't be leaving tomorrow

65
00:03:12,900 --> 00:03:14,400
I might end up leaving, who knows.

66
00:03:14,700 --> 00:03:17,233
But you can whisper to me
one of the names of your crush.

67
00:03:17,667 --> 00:03:19,400
You are so sneaky

68
00:03:19,500 --> 00:03:21,500
I'm gonna go hang with the quadruple.

69
00:03:22,100 --> 00:03:22,867
So I feel like

70
00:03:22,967 --> 00:03:24,600
if I really have a chance to go out with him

71
00:03:24,700 --> 00:03:25,700
despite the rare odds

72
00:03:25,800 --> 00:03:26,667
I want to put my cards on the table

73
00:03:26,767 --> 00:03:28,433
which means I want to be fair.

74
00:03:28,533 --> 00:03:29,200
Now I know who he likes

75
00:03:29,300 --> 00:03:32,067
but he has no idea who my crush is.

76
00:03:35,933 --> 00:03:39,733
(The crew announces the final result)

77
00:03:50,833 --> 00:03:51,633
Alright, now we can talk.

78
00:03:51,733 --> 00:03:52,800
Yes.

79
00:03:54,200 --> 00:03:56,833
So people who chose each other could date now?

80
00:03:56,933 --> 00:03:57,600
Yes.

81
00:03:57,933 --> 00:03:58,767
Well.

82
00:03:58,867 --> 00:04:00,033
Let's go.

83
00:04:02,433 --> 00:04:03,400
(Eri chose Bobo for the second round, and they are a match)
Bye.

84
00:04:03,500 --> 00:04:04,533
Alright, bye.

85
00:04:06,833 --> 00:04:09,933
(Guan-Yu and Gino chose each other for the first round
They are a match)

86
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:16,567
I'm gonna put on some socks.

87
00:04:20,567 --> 00:04:21,900
(NIO picked Guan-Yu for the first round)

88
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:24,133
The moment I knew he didn't choose me

89
00:04:24,233 --> 00:04:25,667
of course at a certain level, I felt

90
00:04:25,767 --> 00:04:27,433
I was being rejected.

91
00:04:27,533 --> 00:04:29,600
But aren't we all human in the world of love?

92
00:04:29,700 --> 00:04:30,800
Well.

93
00:04:30,900 --> 00:04:31,600
Yeah, if you like someone

94
00:04:31,700 --> 00:04:34,133
let him do whatever he wants to do feely

95
00:04:34,233 --> 00:04:36,700
to explore what he likes to explore.

96
00:04:36,967 --> 00:04:38,467
But my messages are...

97
00:04:38,767 --> 00:04:40,200
See, the texts just jump up now.

98
00:04:40,300 --> 00:04:41,467
Now we can talk.

99
00:04:44,267 --> 00:04:46,033
(The rest of them can only stay at the Lavender Forest)
We didn't match successfully, right?

100
00:04:46,133 --> 00:04:49,567
It must be, based on that logic.

101
00:04:49,733 --> 00:04:51,133
This is interesting.

102
00:04:51,233 --> 00:04:52,567
That's fine. It is what it is.

103
00:04:52,667 --> 00:04:54,967
- It's terrifying.
- Absolutely interesting.

104
00:04:56,333 --> 00:04:57,067
(Question/Who did you pick earlier?)
I chose Gino.

105
00:04:57,667 --> 00:04:58,500
I chose Gino

106
00:04:58,833 --> 00:05:01,100
I want to chat with him so I wrote his name

107
00:05:01,333 --> 00:05:03,767
I chose the most unlikely one

108
00:05:03,867 --> 00:05:07,267
so there was no risk at all.

109
00:05:07,367 --> 00:05:08,033
Yeah.

110
00:05:08,133 --> 00:05:11,833
(Let's bring Rainbow Card to the date! Rainbow Card donates 0.2% of general spending to support the LGBT consultation hotline)

111
00:05:15,467 --> 00:05:16,700
This is it.

112
00:05:17,667 --> 00:05:18,100
Go.

113
00:05:18,200 --> 00:05:21,867
Let's bring Rainbow Card to the date!

114
00:05:22,867 --> 00:05:23,567
Adorable.

115
00:05:23,667 --> 00:05:25,367
What shocks me the most

116
00:05:25,467 --> 00:05:28,967
is that Bobo went out with Eri.

117
00:05:29,067 --> 00:05:33,667
Yeah, the rest is probably within my expectations.

118
00:05:33,767 --> 00:05:35,333
It's not far from it.

119
00:05:35,833 --> 00:05:40,433

(Episode 6: This is my favorite day)

130
00:06:19,933 --> 00:06:23,467
But I don't want to be the ones
who cry in the show.

131
00:06:23,567 --> 00:06:24,500
No, someone already cried before.

132
00:06:24,600 --> 00:06:26,133
Yeah, you haven't cried before.

133
00:06:26,233 --> 00:06:27,700
They cried for different things.

134
00:06:27,800 --> 00:06:29,867
They cried because they talked
about their journeys.

135
00:06:29,967 --> 00:06:31,667
If I'd cry, it's because...

136
00:06:31,767 --> 00:06:33,633
- You didn't get picked by your crush.
- That's right.

137
00:06:33,733 --> 00:06:34,900
(NIO's crush didn't choose him...)

138
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:36,133
You didn't choose your crush

139
00:06:36,233 --> 00:06:39,733
I didn't get picked by my crush.

140
00:06:39,900 --> 00:06:42,367
Gosh, so all this time he has been...

141
00:06:42,467 --> 00:06:45,367
- feeling the sorrow.
- I didn't realize it.

142
00:06:45,467 --> 00:06:47,100
You are the complete opposite

143
00:06:47,200 --> 00:06:48,933
but that means what you've done.

144
00:06:49,033 --> 00:06:51,867
It means you put out this great facade.

145
00:06:51,967 --> 00:06:53,200
Because I know you

146
00:06:53,300 --> 00:06:56,133
through the way you wanted people to.

147
00:06:56,233 --> 00:06:57,367
That's also another side of me.

148
00:06:57,467 --> 00:06:59,233
Yeah, but what I'm seeing now is another one.

149
00:06:59,333 --> 00:07:03,800
Which is why I tell you love is my weakness.

150
00:07:03,900 --> 00:07:09,800
It destructs my whole order

151
00:07:09,900 --> 00:07:11,467
I think if anyone would know

152
00:07:11,567 --> 00:07:13,000
that my crush is Guan-Yu

153
00:07:13,100 --> 00:07:14,333
he would be the first one.

154
00:07:14,767 --> 00:07:16,767
He seems to be the most sensitive one

155
00:07:16,867 --> 00:07:20,133
I mean, he considers all kinds of possibilities.

156
00:07:21,100 --> 00:07:23,533
How did you know I didn't choose you?

157
00:07:23,633 --> 00:07:25,100
And you didn't choose me?

158
00:07:25,200 --> 00:07:26,900
You mean me?

159
00:07:28,333 --> 00:07:29,033
Yeah, so...

160
00:07:29,133 --> 00:07:30,367
No, that's why I said I only guessed it.

161
00:07:30,467 --> 00:07:31,000
Do you know why?

162
00:07:31,100 --> 00:07:33,567
Because you two somehow are far more

163
00:07:33,667 --> 00:07:36,633
disappointed by it than it is for me.

164
00:07:36,733 --> 00:07:38,300
So what I mean is that

165
00:07:38,400 --> 00:07:41,367
well, probably because I didn't choose

166
00:07:41,467 --> 00:07:43,800
I didn't choose the one I wanted in my mind.

167
00:07:43,900 --> 00:07:45,200
(Shih-Feng admitted that he didn't pick his favorite person)
Could you tell that earlier I was...

168
00:07:45,300 --> 00:07:47,367
I don't think you did.

169
00:07:47,867 --> 00:07:49,833
You didn't take a risk

170
00:07:49,933 --> 00:07:52,633
which means you didn't put yourself out there.

171
00:07:52,733 --> 00:07:55,067
Because you are afraid of the risk.

172
00:07:55,167 --> 00:07:56,100
That's also why you didn't choose

173
00:07:56,200 --> 00:07:58,367
the one that you really wanted.

174
00:08:00,800 --> 00:08:02,500
I think that's one way to put it

175
00:08:02,600 --> 00:08:05,367
(comforting)
But I feel like, everyone is...

176
00:08:05,467 --> 00:08:07,500
Yeah, that's one way to say it.

177
00:08:10,167 --> 00:08:11,167
Don't cry.

178
00:08:11,267 --> 00:08:13,967
(While combing through his decisions, Shih-Feng gets emotional...)

179
00:08:14,167 --> 00:08:16,900
- I'm sorry for being too straightforward.
- That's fine.

180
00:08:20,933 --> 00:08:23,233
Well, the moment Shih-Feng dropped his tears

181
00:08:23,333 --> 00:08:26,300
my disappointment was all completely gone.

182
00:08:26,400 --> 00:08:27,667
At that moment

183
00:08:27,767 --> 00:08:30,000
I think he needs someone to comfort him

184
00:08:30,100 --> 00:08:31,267
or than I do

185
00:08:31,367 --> 00:08:32,333
so I temporarily tucked away

186
00:08:32,433 --> 00:08:33,033
my own feelings

187
00:08:33,133 --> 00:08:34,967
and went to comfort him first.

188
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:38,133
The thing you talked about earlier.

189
00:08:38,233 --> 00:08:40,567
It reminded me of the time
when I was desperate for love

190
00:08:40,667 --> 00:08:43,800
and I did whatever I could, in every way.

191
00:08:43,900 --> 00:08:44,600
(Remembering the past
and he realized that the process of pursuing love is still hard...)

192
00:08:44,700 --> 00:08:46,767
And it just never occurs to me

193
00:08:48,033 --> 00:08:48,667
it never occurs to me.

194
00:08:48,767 --> 00:08:49,967
When you were talking about it

195
00:08:50,067 --> 00:08:52,267
it made me realize

196
00:08:52,367 --> 00:08:55,400
that I still gave myself a lot of pressure.

197
00:08:55,500 --> 00:08:56,833
Yeah

198
00:08:57,200 --> 00:08:58,333
I don't believe that's necessary, though

199
00:08:58,433 --> 00:09:01,267
because what we can do.

200
00:09:01,367 --> 00:09:02,833
(Susu gave Shih-Feng a lot of comfort...)
is only within our control.

201
00:09:02,933 --> 00:09:04,967
Whether other people take it or not
it's their business.

202
00:09:05,067 --> 00:09:05,533
Yeah.

203
00:09:05,633 --> 00:09:07,800
And that's their problem.

204
00:09:08,333 --> 00:09:10,333
They all seemed a bit confused

205
00:09:10,433 --> 00:09:13,233
about why Eri chose Bobo.

206
00:09:13,333 --> 00:09:15,867
At some point, I guess
the reason why Eri picked him

207
00:09:15,967 --> 00:09:18,433
is similar to the logic I have

208
00:09:18,533 --> 00:09:22,033
which is that, sometime
we all are somehow uncomfortable dealing with

209
00:09:22,133 --> 00:09:23,333
the person we really like.

210
00:09:23,433 --> 00:09:26,067
Perhaps keeping a little distance

211
00:09:26,167 --> 00:09:28,367
may be the best option we have

212
00:09:28,467 --> 00:09:30,067
especially for someone we care about.

213
00:09:30,900 --> 00:09:33,867
Either I want him to approach me so bad

214
00:09:33,967 --> 00:09:35,700
or I want him to be too comfortable

215
00:09:35,800 --> 00:09:38,667
so I step way back into the shadow.

216
00:09:38,767 --> 00:09:42,033
But it's not easy to achieve this 50%.

217
00:09:42,133 --> 00:09:45,067
It's common to be leaning
towards one side too much.

218
00:09:45,167 --> 00:09:47,867
Besides, this 50% means different to everyone.

219
00:09:47,967 --> 00:09:50,033
The only way to do it is to try it out

220
00:09:50,133 --> 00:09:51,867
and to make adjustments, yeah.

221
00:09:51,967 --> 00:09:54,800
- So...
- But your comfort feels great.

222
00:09:54,900 --> 00:09:57,533
Your patting has been really.

223
00:09:57,633 --> 00:10:00,367
A way of telling me I will get better

224
00:10:00,733 --> 00:10:01,267
I'd appreciate it.

225
00:10:01,367 --> 00:10:02,933
Yeah.

226
00:10:03,133 --> 00:10:04,900
It's all good.

227
00:10:06,167 --> 00:10:06,967
It's fine.

228
00:10:07,067 --> 00:10:09,633
Sometimes, we are more
sensitive to certain things.

229
00:10:09,733 --> 00:10:11,900
Yeah, so...

230
00:10:12,333 --> 00:10:15,900
- Don't.
- Please don't. This is not the time.

231
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:16,667
Sorry.

232
00:10:16,767 --> 00:10:18,800
Not the time.

233
00:10:18,900 --> 00:10:22,633
It's awkward, sorry, my bad.

234
00:10:24,900 --> 00:10:28,433
(Taichung Yuuno Kai)

235
00:10:31,567 --> 00:10:33,500
- There are so many plants.
- They look beautiful.

236
00:10:33,600 --> 00:10:34,367
(Bobo and Eri visit this Japanese-style cafe)

237
00:10:34,467 --> 00:10:36,067
Do you like plants?

238
00:10:36,167 --> 00:10:37,500
I kind of like it.

239
00:10:37,600 --> 00:10:39,467
It's just sometimes it takes effort
to take care of plants.

240
00:10:40,533 --> 00:10:42,200
Then when you were a florist

241
00:10:42,300 --> 00:10:44,267
what exactly did you do?

242
00:10:44,600 --> 00:10:45,767
Flower bouquet

243
00:10:45,867 --> 00:10:49,233
or we do flower arrangement
at venues from time to time.

244
00:10:49,333 --> 00:10:50,633
- Okay.
- Yeah.

245
00:10:50,733 --> 00:10:53,100
(They begin their first date surrounded by greeneries...)

246
00:10:56,400 --> 00:10:57,567
They actually have plenty of stuff over here.

247
00:10:57,667 --> 00:10:59,267
Perfect plants for home.

248
00:10:59,367 --> 00:11:00,767
Especially the area over there.

249
00:11:00,867 --> 00:11:02,833
It definitely gives me the jungle vibe.

250
00:11:02,933 --> 00:11:04,767
Yeah, besides
didn't you just move to a new house?

251
00:11:04,867 --> 00:11:05,500
I did

252
00:11:05,600 --> 00:11:08,100
I could bring one over to your place.

253
00:11:08,200 --> 00:11:10,400
Maybe a bigger one
My house is kind of tall.

254
00:11:10,500 --> 00:11:12,300
A bigger one? Such a picky person

255
00:11:12,400 --> 00:11:14,100
(both are joking around comfortably)
Look at you, all cheeky

256
00:11:15,767 --> 00:11:19,033
I've always been great with Bobo.

257
00:11:19,133 --> 00:11:20,900
Personally, I think we could

258
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:24,733
explore each other and understand him better

259
00:11:24,833 --> 00:11:26,467
in a better environment

260
00:11:26,567 --> 00:11:29,533
where it's outside of our room

261
00:11:29,633 --> 00:11:32,500
because we two bonded the moment we met.

262
00:11:32,600 --> 00:11:35,867
That's why I chose Bobo instead of Shih-Feng.

263
00:11:36,200 --> 00:11:38,333
- It's actually quite pretty.
- It smells nice.

264
00:11:38,433 --> 00:11:38,867
Seriously?

265
00:11:38,967 --> 00:11:40,700
- As I recall, it smells nice.
- There are petals here.

266
00:11:41,033 --> 00:11:43,267
It really smells amazing
I'm not kidding.

267
00:11:43,367 --> 00:11:45,500
- Yeah, and the scent...
- You have to put it on your head.

268
00:11:45,600 --> 00:11:47,000
That scent is not basic.

269
00:11:47,100 --> 00:11:48,000
Yeah, it feels like.

270
00:11:48,100 --> 00:11:49,867
Fun fact, it is not the case for other men.

271
00:11:49,967 --> 00:11:50,800
- Only I could do that.
- True.

272
00:11:50,900 --> 00:11:53,733
The flower would only stay up there in your hair.

273
00:11:54,033 --> 00:11:55,567
- How does it look?
- Show it to everyone

274
00:11:55,667 --> 00:11:57,067
I don't think it looks bad.

275
00:11:58,000 --> 00:11:59,333
Don't expect true answers from him.

276
00:11:59,800 --> 00:12:01,400
Everytime I ask you

277
00:12:01,500 --> 00:12:03,100
how my makeup looks

278
00:12:03,200 --> 00:12:03,867
I think they are the same.

279
00:12:03,967 --> 00:12:05,533
He thinks it looks the same every time.

280
00:12:10,033 --> 00:12:11,733
(Taichung Xanadu)

281
00:12:12,533 --> 00:12:13,900
What a huge nest.

282
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:15,000
(Gino and Guan-Yu embark on their date adventure)

283
00:12:15,100 --> 00:12:15,533
Did you see that?

284
00:12:15,633 --> 00:12:16,733
Yes, I did see that

285
00:12:16,833 --> 00:12:19,100
I was seriously shocked that there...

286
00:12:19,200 --> 00:12:23,333
- was a huge nest over there.
- You just groped me and said what a huge ass.

287
00:12:24,733 --> 00:12:25,900
It's "what a huge nest".

288
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:28,433
How would I know
you were gonna say "nest"?

289
00:12:30,600 --> 00:12:33,367
(Question/Why did you choose Gino?)
Right then, I think Gino would be the one

290
00:12:33,467 --> 00:12:36,967
whom I'd get along with the most eventually.

291
00:12:37,433 --> 00:12:38,700
That's hydrangeas.

292
00:12:39,567 --> 00:12:40,667
- Hydrangeas.
- That's right.

293
00:12:40,767 --> 00:12:42,533
There are lots of hydrangeas in Taitung.

294
00:12:43,200 --> 00:12:45,067
I heard you like flowers.

295
00:12:45,600 --> 00:12:48,567
Every flower has its own story and I like it.

296
00:12:48,667 --> 00:12:52,067
Apart from fresh flowers, I prefer dried flowers.

297
00:12:52,500 --> 00:12:54,967
We want to capture the moment
when flowers are the most beautiful

298
00:12:55,067 --> 00:12:57,867
so we choose to dry them up.

299
00:12:57,967 --> 00:13:01,100
As if the memory would be frozen in time.

300
00:13:01,200 --> 00:13:04,367
To keep people company by their sides

301
00:13:04,467 --> 00:13:06,667
even though it's not its most beautiful moment.

302
00:13:08,133 --> 00:13:09,733
(Question/Why did you choose Guan-Yu?)
Going out with him is what I want.

303
00:13:09,833 --> 00:13:12,433
Just following my heart

304
00:13:14,467 --> 00:13:16,467
3 2 1

305
00:13:17,267 --> 00:13:19,467
I think we two look a little bit alike.

306
00:13:20,667 --> 00:13:21,833
I think so.

307
00:13:23,733 --> 00:13:25,567
He has no choice but to nod.

308
00:13:26,033 --> 00:13:28,833
Why did you keep pushing him and asking him.

309
00:13:29,033 --> 00:13:32,500
(Their second date got a lot more natural...)

310
00:13:38,067 --> 00:13:40,067
Up to the present time, I haven't seen

311
00:13:40,167 --> 00:13:42,633
the combination of gymnastics and flowers.

312
00:13:42,900 --> 00:13:44,767
Honestly, I've been thinking about it a while ago.

313
00:13:44,867 --> 00:13:48,233
If workouts pair with music or herbs or flowers.

314
00:13:48,533 --> 00:13:50,367
Yeah, the idea would be more like

315
00:13:50,833 --> 00:13:52,433
to work out in a more natural way

316
00:13:52,533 --> 00:13:54,367
to get the body into its natural self.

317
00:13:54,467 --> 00:13:58,800
This seems like a pretty nice idea.

318
00:14:00,533 --> 00:14:02,700
- This view up front is kind of amazing.
- I agree.

319
00:14:02,800 --> 00:14:05,333
Trees in a spare land.

320
00:14:05,567 --> 00:14:06,267
The most relaxing thing in Taitung

321
00:14:06,367 --> 00:14:09,233
is the scenery of mountains whenever I look up.

322
00:14:09,967 --> 00:14:13,500
And the sky is always in gradient colors.

323
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:16,233
I am so glad that I moved there.

324
00:14:16,333 --> 00:14:19,967
Thank god it's a place
where I can get in touch with nature.

325
00:14:20,067 --> 00:14:21,533
Well, then have you hiked before?

326
00:14:21,633 --> 00:14:23,067
To tell you the truth, it's a pity

327
00:14:23,167 --> 00:14:25,367
I always had a part-time job
during my school year

328
00:14:25,467 --> 00:14:27,100
so time wasn't really something I had

329
00:14:27,200 --> 00:14:28,933
I felt like I gotta grab the chance

330
00:14:29,033 --> 00:14:30,700
to accumulate my experience

331
00:14:30,800 --> 00:14:32,700
and to get a ton of jobs.

332
00:14:32,800 --> 00:14:35,300
But I guess it's probably time to take a rest.

333
00:14:35,400 --> 00:14:38,067
It's only been four months since I graduated.

334
00:14:39,400 --> 00:14:41,800
Gosh, you really do give yourself a lot of pressure.

335
00:14:41,900 --> 00:14:43,400
Is it because you need money

336
00:14:43,500 --> 00:14:46,433
or is it because you want to
have more experiences?

337
00:14:46,533 --> 00:14:48,767
- Or it is...
- Both, I think it's both.

338
00:14:49,100 --> 00:14:50,700
To be clear, I transferred
to the music department secretly

339
00:14:50,800 --> 00:14:52,267
I feel like I take...

340
00:14:52,933 --> 00:14:55,400
My family did not know after the fact

341
00:14:55,500 --> 00:14:57,233
that I transferred to the music department.

342
00:14:57,333 --> 00:14:58,567
And my dad was like.

343
00:14:59,800 --> 00:15:01,867
Yeah, so I feel like I have to.

344
00:15:01,967 --> 00:15:03,133
(They delve deeper into their past)
take this responsibility.

345
00:15:03,233 --> 00:15:05,533
You are really brave.

346
00:15:16,233 --> 00:15:17,667
(The rest of the four wander around the Lavender Forest)
Gosh, I'm gonna let everyone down

347
00:15:17,767 --> 00:15:19,600
since I don't remember most of them.

348
00:15:19,833 --> 00:15:22,500
That's hydrangeas.

349
00:15:22,600 --> 00:15:24,000
It was you who told me this.

350
00:15:24,100 --> 00:15:25,967
We basically can just skip my introduction.

351
00:15:27,267 --> 00:15:30,200
This beats me, though
Is it parsley?

352
00:15:32,733 --> 00:15:34,067
Parsley.

353
00:15:35,167 --> 00:15:36,367
Great fit for the seafood.

354
00:15:36,467 --> 00:15:36,900
Oh, right.

355
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:39,567
- You can see this on the spaghetti.
- Yeah.

356
00:15:40,700 --> 00:15:42,333
There's Perilla over there.

357
00:15:42,900 --> 00:15:44,333
I remember on the first day

358
00:15:44,433 --> 00:15:46,967
I wanted to have a drink but I failed

359
00:15:47,067 --> 00:15:48,433
so I ended up sniffing the perilla.

360
00:15:48,533 --> 00:15:50,367
What do you mean?
Perilla is for the hangover?

361
00:15:50,467 --> 00:15:52,600
Perilla tastes great in the alcohol
It is giving me...

362
00:15:52,700 --> 00:15:53,567
I want it.

363
00:15:53,667 --> 00:15:54,200
Me either.

364
00:15:54,300 --> 00:15:56,267
Same here. Take me there.

365
00:15:57,267 --> 00:15:58,633
But you have to rub it.

366
00:16:03,333 --> 00:16:04,533
It smells like alcohol.

367
00:16:04,633 --> 00:16:05,933
- Doesn't it?
- It does.

368
00:16:06,033 --> 00:16:06,933
(Everyone simultaneously agrees)

369
00:16:07,700 --> 00:16:09,767
(somehow it gives them a chance to bond together...)

370
00:16:10,233 --> 00:16:11,267
I think it's interesting

371
00:16:11,367 --> 00:16:13,933
when the dating is out of the picture

372
00:16:14,033 --> 00:16:15,300
to take it seriously.

373
00:16:15,400 --> 00:16:17,033
When I am meeting NIO as a friend

374
00:16:17,133 --> 00:16:19,100
the whole process is quite interesting.

375
00:16:19,200 --> 00:16:20,300
Besides, I also discover

376
00:16:20,400 --> 00:16:23,000
that NIO is different
from what it looks like on the outside.

377
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:28,133
It's so scary.

378
00:16:28,233 --> 00:16:29,967
It is really loud.

379
00:16:30,767 --> 00:16:31,867
Do you want to make a wish?

380
00:16:31,967 --> 00:16:32,700
I don't want to.

381
00:16:32,800 --> 00:16:34,200
Then I do.

382
00:16:34,300 --> 00:16:36,667
Is the wish about love?

383
00:16:37,700 --> 00:16:38,767
A little.

384
00:16:39,933 --> 00:16:43,233
(What did NIO wish for...?)

385
00:16:48,700 --> 00:16:50,267
We are like two candies.

386
00:16:50,500 --> 00:16:51,567
You definitely are.

387
00:16:51,800 --> 00:16:53,067
This will look fantastic on the screen.

388
00:16:53,167 --> 00:16:55,100
Plus that sunlight.

389
00:16:55,200 --> 00:16:56,567
It is just perfect...

390
00:16:57,300 --> 00:16:59,167
Surprisingly, it is very comfortable.

391
00:16:59,267 --> 00:17:00,833
Today is probably by far

392
00:17:00,933 --> 00:17:02,367
my favorite day.

393
00:17:03,133 --> 00:17:05,500
The four of us go back to the start

394
00:17:05,600 --> 00:17:09,000
and to get to know each other
without caring a thing.

395
00:17:09,100 --> 00:17:10,800
Just to have random conversations.

396
00:17:10,900 --> 00:17:12,533
It's like, our crushes

397
00:17:12,633 --> 00:17:13,733
are not among the four of us

398
00:17:13,833 --> 00:17:16,200
so it doesn't really matter, yeah.

399
00:17:16,467 --> 00:17:17,733
This is just memorable

400
00:17:17,833 --> 00:17:20,633
I will remember this day till I'm 80

401
00:17:20,733 --> 00:17:23,200
and I gotta tell my grandson about it.

402
00:17:23,733 --> 00:17:25,600
Will you have grandchildren?

403
00:17:26,267 --> 00:17:27,200
I hope so.

404
00:17:27,300 --> 00:17:28,467
Alright, I hope so

405
00:17:28,567 --> 00:17:29,633
I won't have one.

406
00:17:30,467 --> 00:17:33,933
The picture I just took will be called
"I will have grandchildren".

407
00:17:34,433 --> 00:17:36,867
What a terrible name, this is...

408
00:17:36,967 --> 00:17:39,233
I don't want to look at it
The name sucks.

409
00:17:39,700 --> 00:17:43,233
(Hanging out with the simplest intention, without the pressure of dating and love)

410
00:17:49,567 --> 00:17:53,267
(As for the people who chose each other, the air is getting thicker...)

411
00:17:55,233 --> 00:17:56,633
Not a great photographer, huh.

412
00:17:56,733 --> 00:17:57,967
Exactly like older parents.

413
00:17:58,067 --> 00:18:00,467
Influencer, can you show me a trick or two?

414
00:18:00,567 --> 00:18:01,400
Okay.

415
00:18:02,933 --> 00:18:04,000
Looks nice.

416
00:18:04,100 --> 00:18:06,700
Really? Oh, stop that

417
00:18:06,800 --> 00:18:08,533
I mean the picture.

418
00:18:09,200 --> 00:18:10,033
The sun came in.

419
00:18:10,133 --> 00:18:12,167
Didn't the sun come a little too fast?

420
00:18:12,500 --> 00:18:17,233
Love arrives like a thunderstorm.

421
00:18:19,733 --> 00:18:21,667
I'll give you the less greasy parts.

422
00:18:21,767 --> 00:18:22,467
Have the first bite.

423
00:18:22,567 --> 00:18:24,100
No, you go first.

424
00:18:26,233 --> 00:18:28,000
- The fish tastes amazing.
- It does?

425
00:18:28,100 --> 00:18:30,400
You said that I was like a dad

426
00:18:30,500 --> 00:18:32,967
I think eating non-processed food is great.

427
00:18:33,067 --> 00:18:34,033
Yeah.

428
00:18:36,133 --> 00:18:37,967
- Do you want a bite?
- Sure.

429
00:18:39,733 --> 00:18:42,200
This is how I grab my tableware.

430
00:18:42,300 --> 00:18:43,467
Like holding a needle.

431
00:18:43,567 --> 00:18:44,900
It is delicious.

432
00:18:45,600 --> 00:18:46,767
No bad.

433
00:18:49,200 --> 00:18:51,600
What is the most memorable thing
during these couple of days.

434
00:18:51,700 --> 00:18:52,767
During these three days.

435
00:18:52,867 --> 00:18:53,833
Honestly...

436
00:18:53,933 --> 00:18:56,633
More that that
we already spent four days together.

437
00:18:57,533 --> 00:18:59,433
I think last night was...

438
00:18:59,800 --> 00:19:01,300
I really like that feeling.

439
00:19:01,900 --> 00:19:03,767
I mean, sharing stories with everyone

440
00:19:03,867 --> 00:19:05,267
and our own experiences.

441
00:19:05,367 --> 00:19:06,800
You mean with Abao?

442
00:19:06,900 --> 00:19:08,700
During the dinner with Abao

443
00:19:08,800 --> 00:19:12,500
I think everyone has crazy stories to tell

444
00:19:12,600 --> 00:19:16,000
in terms of self-discovery and the dynamics of the family

445
00:19:16,100 --> 00:19:17,367
(recalling the conversation with Abao last night)
Plus I...

446
00:19:18,233 --> 00:19:20,267
I didn't expect you'd cry that hard

447
00:19:20,367 --> 00:19:22,933
I mean in a moving kind of way.

448
00:19:23,033 --> 00:19:23,867
Whether it's hearing my own stories

449
00:19:23,967 --> 00:19:25,867
or hearing from other people.

450
00:19:25,967 --> 00:19:28,167
What I feel about you at first sight

451
00:19:28,267 --> 00:19:30,400
would have this idea

452
00:19:30,500 --> 00:19:32,300
that you already are a public figure.

453
00:19:32,400 --> 00:19:34,000
So I think in terms of dealing with these things

454
00:19:34,100 --> 00:19:38,033
you are already numb or you have this facade.

455
00:19:38,133 --> 00:19:40,233
Yeah, you wouldn't be this real.

456
00:19:40,333 --> 00:19:44,233
And you ended up dropping your tears
and getting touched.

457
00:19:44,867 --> 00:19:47,633
Well, because family has always been an issue

458
00:19:47,733 --> 00:19:49,867
that is near and dear to me.

459
00:19:49,967 --> 00:19:51,633
(Gino thinks he isn't brave towards his family relationships)
Then I hear all kinds of stories from everyone

460
00:19:51,733 --> 00:19:53,867
they are all brave in different ways.

461
00:19:53,967 --> 00:19:54,433
Yeah.

462
00:19:54,533 --> 00:19:56,167
Later, it kind of hit me

463
00:19:56,267 --> 00:19:58,467
that I still wasn't being brave enough.

464
00:19:58,567 --> 00:20:01,000
The truth is, if I'm brave enough.

465
00:20:01,767 --> 00:20:03,267
I would've shown it to them

466
00:20:03,367 --> 00:20:04,567
but it was not in me

467
00:20:04,667 --> 00:20:07,067
I think you'll be good friends with my mom.

468
00:20:07,167 --> 00:20:07,700
How's so?

469
00:20:07,800 --> 00:20:10,833
My mom is quite...

470
00:20:10,933 --> 00:20:12,767
My mom is a very romantic person.

471
00:20:13,167 --> 00:20:14,433
She even posted and shared

472
00:20:14,533 --> 00:20:17,767
the hand-written love letters
between her and my dad

473
00:20:17,867 --> 00:20:21,100
before getting married with him.

474
00:20:21,200 --> 00:20:23,200
And she even took it out, being nostalgic

475
00:20:23,300 --> 00:20:25,200
saying that she missed those times

476
00:20:25,300 --> 00:20:28,633
but even after 30 years with Guan and Niu.

477
00:20:28,733 --> 00:20:29,867
Niu is my sister.

478
00:20:30,067 --> 00:20:31,400
She thinks she is blessed

479
00:20:31,500 --> 00:20:33,867
and she loves it

480
00:20:33,967 --> 00:20:36,967
I have a feeling
that you guys will become good friends.

481
00:20:37,067 --> 00:20:39,033
No wonder you are romantic

482
00:20:39,200 --> 00:20:42,167
I think my mom and dad
passed me their romantic spirit.

483
00:20:42,433 --> 00:20:43,533
My dad is a romantic, too.

484
00:20:43,633 --> 00:20:45,700
He even wrote love letters
and he studied science.

485
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:47,900
The letter addressed to my mom

486
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:50,167
saying that if you are chlorophyll
I'm your acetone

487
00:20:50,267 --> 00:20:52,167
because it dissolves chlorophyll.

488
00:20:54,567 --> 00:20:55,133
Excellent.

489
00:20:55,233 --> 00:20:56,167
Gosh, if this clip goes on air

490
00:20:56,267 --> 00:20:56,967
(generously sharing his family stories...)
my mom would be pissed.

491
00:20:57,067 --> 00:20:58,100
"How could you tell him

492
00:20:58,200 --> 00:21:00,500
our romantic stories?"

493
00:21:02,333 --> 00:21:04,033
Well, let me ask you something.

494
00:21:04,133 --> 00:21:06,033
You...

495
00:21:06,900 --> 00:21:08,300
How many relationships did you have before?

496
00:21:08,400 --> 00:21:10,067
Five.

497
00:21:10,167 --> 00:21:11,400
And their age are around...

498
00:21:11,500 --> 00:21:14,000
They were as old as me or a little younger.

499
00:21:15,133 --> 00:21:18,567
So you've never gone out with someone older?

500
00:21:18,667 --> 00:21:20,900
I did, but we didn't end up together.

501
00:21:21,100 --> 00:21:23,233
How many years apart then?

502
00:21:24,567 --> 00:21:25,567
Ten-year gap.

503
00:21:25,667 --> 00:21:27,067
Also a ten-year gap.

504
00:21:27,433 --> 00:21:28,700
(Gino is also ten years older than Guan-Yu)
He took great care of me

505
00:21:28,800 --> 00:21:32,233
but we didn't end up getting together.

506
00:21:32,933 --> 00:21:34,900
What's your take on long-distance relationships?

507
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:37,400
Let me just say that I have no experience.

508
00:21:37,500 --> 00:21:39,900
Not any of my relationships are long-distance

509
00:21:40,267 --> 00:21:41,733
I've never had long-distance relationships

510
00:21:41,833 --> 00:21:44,233
(talking about their opinions on long distant)
My definition of a long-term one probably includes...

511
00:21:44,800 --> 00:21:47,800
the one from Taipei to Taoyuan.

512
00:21:47,900 --> 00:21:48,367
Seriously?

513
00:21:48,467 --> 00:21:49,733
Because it takes a one-hour train.

514
00:21:49,833 --> 00:21:51,867
(Taitung←→Taipei 324 kilometers)
to get to that place.

515
00:21:51,967 --> 00:21:53,833
Personally, I think that counts as long-distant.

516
00:21:53,933 --> 00:21:57,267
Earlier of my relationships are long distant.

517
00:22:00,300 --> 00:22:03,233
Yeah, I'm pretty okay with long-distant.

518
00:22:03,333 --> 00:22:06,500
(Compared to Gino, Guan-Yu is used to long-distant one)
I'd try to finish whatever I have and go live with him.

519
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:09,867
For example, the contracts I sign

520
00:22:09,967 --> 00:22:11,900
is probably about a year

521
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:14,567
(pondering)
And I'll try to see if can be shortened to half of a year.

522
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:16,767
Perhaps we could make some adjustments

523
00:22:16,867 --> 00:22:19,100
and see if the holidays can be a little longer

524
00:22:19,200 --> 00:22:20,267
I want to be clear with my partner

525
00:22:20,367 --> 00:22:21,300
that I'm willing to make an effort.

526
00:22:21,400 --> 00:22:22,833
But you have to wait for me.

527
00:22:22,933 --> 00:22:24,033
For sure, I think

528
00:22:24,133 --> 00:22:25,600
if two people love each other enough

529
00:22:25,700 --> 00:22:28,233
those difficulties can be conquered.

530
00:22:28,333 --> 00:22:30,500
And I still believe in that.

531
00:22:30,600 --> 00:22:31,767
However, during the whole process

532
00:22:31,867 --> 00:22:34,900
we will be a little harder.

533
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:37,067
Yeah, that's what I think.

534
00:22:38,100 --> 00:22:41,200
People who could.

535
00:22:41,967 --> 00:22:43,133
If my partner only wants to have fun with me

536
00:22:43,233 --> 00:22:47,867
I think anybody can have fun with me.

537
00:22:49,133 --> 00:22:52,533
However, if someone is willing to

538
00:22:53,033 --> 00:22:54,967
take on those burdens, I'm more than happy to.

539
00:22:55,067 --> 00:22:57,300
If there are some burdens that my partner

540
00:22:57,400 --> 00:23:00,467
wants me to take on, I'm happy to do it.

541
00:23:01,467 --> 00:23:03,300
There are so many things he wants to do

542
00:23:03,400 --> 00:23:06,800
but he tries so hard to take them on all at once.

543
00:23:06,900 --> 00:23:08,767
To see responsibilities as a huge thing.

544
00:23:08,867 --> 00:23:10,733
That's huge burden.

545
00:23:10,833 --> 00:23:14,967
So I want him to take it easy.

546
00:23:15,067 --> 00:23:18,233
The thing is, when you mentioned
taking on responsibilities

547
00:23:18,333 --> 00:23:20,300
one thing that pops up in my head is actually

548
00:23:20,400 --> 00:23:24,000
that whether it's taking care
of my partner or myself

549
00:23:24,100 --> 00:23:27,700
there is no need to take on other's challenges

550
00:23:27,800 --> 00:23:29,500
I can be a listener and accompany him

551
00:23:29,600 --> 00:23:32,267
but taking on is a huge word.

552
00:23:32,833 --> 00:23:37,167
(As someone who had this experience, Gino provided different perspectives)
We just accompany each other and grow together.

553
00:23:37,267 --> 00:23:39,000
Personally, this would be.

554
00:23:39,100 --> 00:23:41,267
This would be a healthier version
of responsibilities.

555
00:23:41,767 --> 00:23:44,933
I want my partner to lean on my shoulder.

556
00:23:46,667 --> 00:23:48,267
Don't take it on anymore.

557
00:23:49,067 --> 00:23:49,933
Capricorn.

558
00:23:50,033 --> 00:23:50,867
Don't take it on anymore.

559
00:23:50,967 --> 00:23:51,500
Capricorn.

560
00:23:51,600 --> 00:23:53,900
You're just like me
We love taking on responsibilities.

561
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:55,467
Stop doing that.

562
00:24:02,233 --> 00:24:02,933
(On the other hand
Bobo and Eri have a comfortable chat)

563
00:24:03,033 --> 00:24:04,700
It looks incredible.

564
00:24:05,067 --> 00:24:09,200
Don't you have a sore throat?
You can stick to the veggies

565
00:24:09,300 --> 00:24:10,600
I can't resist.

566
00:24:11,867 --> 00:24:14,933
How did you get the text?

567
00:24:15,033 --> 00:24:15,900
I still wanted to express

568
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:19,400
the idea that I was still curious about him.

569
00:24:19,500 --> 00:24:21,767
That's why I chose him.

570
00:24:21,867 --> 00:24:24,667
(Eri explained why he chose NIO)
but he didn't choose, and that is...

571
00:24:25,433 --> 00:24:26,567
Nothing unexpected.

572
00:24:26,667 --> 00:24:28,800
It's all fated, yeah.

573
00:24:28,900 --> 00:24:29,967
- Alright.
- Umm.

574
00:24:30,067 --> 00:24:33,867
Honestly, I was really straightforward.

575
00:24:33,967 --> 00:24:35,067
You typed "Eri" right away?

576
00:24:35,167 --> 00:24:37,567
(Bobo chose Eri right from the start)
Yeah, I instantly typed Eri.

577
00:24:38,800 --> 00:24:40,600
Back then, I was wondering

578
00:24:40,700 --> 00:24:44,900
what exactly was my purpose here

579
00:24:45,000 --> 00:24:46,000
I got me thinking really hard yesterday.

580
00:24:46,100 --> 00:24:47,800
After talking to Abao

581
00:24:47,900 --> 00:24:49,200
I've been alone these three years

582
00:24:49,300 --> 00:24:50,933
you've been alone for four years.

583
00:24:51,033 --> 00:24:53,900
Perhaps there might be some time

584
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:55,667
when we desperately wanted to find

585
00:24:55,767 --> 00:24:57,400
find someone we can lean on.

586
00:24:57,500 --> 00:24:58,167
However, in the meantime.

587
00:24:58,267 --> 00:25:00,967
It is possible that in times of being fearful

588
00:25:01,067 --> 00:25:02,933
I might get too invested in a relationship

589
00:25:03,033 --> 00:25:04,400
I'm scared that

590
00:25:04,500 --> 00:25:06,233
it is stressful for me and the other half.

591
00:25:06,333 --> 00:25:08,200
That's why I thought about it so hard yesterday

592
00:25:08,300 --> 00:25:09,400
and I went through it today.

593
00:25:09,500 --> 00:25:12,000
Then what is my purpose for coming here today?

594
00:25:12,100 --> 00:25:12,833
It hit me hard that

595
00:25:12,933 --> 00:25:15,200
I already knew this wonderful friend

596
00:25:15,300 --> 00:25:18,567
I'd rather hold tight to this friendship.

597
00:25:18,667 --> 00:25:20,633
(The friendship with Eri is more valuable to Bobo now)
and to the things I have now.

598
00:25:20,733 --> 00:25:23,667
Whatever happens next, I'll deal with it.

599
00:25:23,767 --> 00:25:26,500
Isn't that moving? Are you tearing up?

600
00:25:26,733 --> 00:25:28,533
To be honest with you, I'm moved.

601
00:25:28,633 --> 00:25:31,033
Plus the help you offered me yesterday.

602
00:25:31,133 --> 00:25:32,800
Didn't you guys end up together?

603
00:25:32,900 --> 00:25:33,700
Feeling jolly

604
00:25:33,800 --> 00:25:36,467
I was already content that we walked together

605
00:25:36,567 --> 00:25:38,000
I bet it was obvious enough for him.

606
00:25:38,100 --> 00:25:39,000
He already knew I liked him

607
00:25:39,100 --> 00:25:41,167
I already called him twice.

608
00:25:41,267 --> 00:25:44,567
During this short amount of time

609
00:25:44,667 --> 00:25:45,867
I am already very grateful

610
00:25:45,967 --> 00:25:46,833
to be able to

611
00:25:46,933 --> 00:25:48,733
be this joyful, so thank you.

612
00:25:48,833 --> 00:25:49,867
My pleasure.

613
00:25:49,967 --> 00:25:52,333
You really should be thanking me.

614
00:25:52,433 --> 00:25:54,900
But if it was you by my side

615
00:25:55,000 --> 00:25:56,500
I'd be happy, too.

616
00:25:58,400 --> 00:26:00,400
It's pretty much how I expected it to be

617
00:26:00,500 --> 00:26:03,700
I think I'm blessed in every way.

618
00:26:03,800 --> 00:26:08,600
Yeah, it's been joyful to...

619
00:26:13,267 --> 00:26:14,500
I think it's an honor

620
00:26:14,600 --> 00:26:17,700
to be able to meet a friend this important

621
00:26:17,800 --> 00:26:19,000
during those short times

622
00:26:19,100 --> 00:26:22,800
which is three days.

623
00:26:22,900 --> 00:26:23,800
We shared a lot.

624
00:26:23,900 --> 00:26:28,500
And I'm thankful that he helped me a lot

625
00:26:28,600 --> 00:26:30,433
I think there is a spot for him

626
00:26:30,533 --> 00:26:32,600
in my life right now

627
00:26:32,700 --> 00:26:34,700
I think he is important

628
00:26:34,800 --> 00:26:36,667
(talking about first impressions)
I thought you were tough initially.

629
00:26:36,767 --> 00:26:39,667
The second we talked

630
00:26:39,767 --> 00:26:41,900
I mean when we entered our room

631
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:43,767
I kind of realized you are a great person
to talk to.

632
00:26:43,867 --> 00:26:45,033
So I officially apologize

633
00:26:45,133 --> 00:26:48,800
I'm afraid to talk in public spaces.

634
00:26:48,900 --> 00:26:51,233
You can talk with other people in private.

635
00:26:51,333 --> 00:26:53,100
When I talk to someone...

636
00:26:53,200 --> 00:26:55,467
Since my first day here was to be with Shih-Feng

637
00:26:55,567 --> 00:26:57,967
I'm not sure how I did on that day

638
00:26:58,067 --> 00:27:01,067
but I knew what I wanted to talk about.

639
00:27:01,167 --> 00:27:03,367
And it went well on the second day.

640
00:27:03,467 --> 00:27:04,667
Who were you with the second day?

641
00:27:05,067 --> 00:27:07,167
(Bobo talked with Gino on the second day...)
Of course it went well. You like him.

642
00:27:07,933 --> 00:27:09,267
Alright, thanks.

643
00:27:09,667 --> 00:27:10,733
I think I broke

644
00:27:10,833 --> 00:27:12,200
I broke your all first impressions.

645
00:27:12,300 --> 00:27:13,567
Completely broken.

646
00:27:13,667 --> 00:27:17,233
A lot of people say I'm just a little girl.

647
00:27:17,333 --> 00:27:19,367
Even when I post on Instagram

648
00:27:19,467 --> 00:27:21,333
someone would say, "You're so pretty".

649
00:27:21,433 --> 00:27:22,900
So you don't like someone telling you that?

650
00:27:23,000 --> 00:27:25,100
(Eri talks about his opinions on how people think of him)
I'm fine with being called pretty or handsome

651
00:27:25,200 --> 00:27:27,367
but sometimes they call me sister.

652
00:27:27,933 --> 00:27:30,633
That's something I don't really get

653
00:27:30,733 --> 00:27:33,800
I'm not particularly against this idea

654
00:27:33,900 --> 00:27:35,000
for me, I think that is just

655
00:27:35,100 --> 00:27:37,900
a title for one person to another.

656
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:38,467
But I think

657
00:27:38,567 --> 00:27:42,567
everyone should keep an open mind
and to talk.

658
00:27:42,667 --> 00:27:44,400
Or else how will you know
what kind of person I am.

659
00:27:44,500 --> 00:27:45,133
Yeah.

660
00:27:45,233 --> 00:27:47,400
Well, if you didn't share a room with me

661
00:27:47,667 --> 00:27:49,300
you wouldn't possibly know my personality.

662
00:27:49,400 --> 00:27:51,900
We wouldn't possibly be dating over here.

663
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:52,733
We wouldn't talk.

664
00:27:52,833 --> 00:27:53,800
Yeah.

665
00:27:54,233 --> 00:27:55,767
A very special bond.

666
00:27:55,867 --> 00:27:58,967
A lot of people are looking for happiness

667
00:27:59,067 --> 00:28:01,900
but they don't realize
happiness is already around

668
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:05,367
I think Bobo gave me a lot of happiness.

669
00:28:18,833 --> 00:28:19,733
(They are enjoying their lunch
at the Lavender Forest)

670
00:28:19,833 --> 00:28:22,333
You ordered a hotpot during summer days
I admire that.

671
00:28:22,433 --> 00:28:24,067
No, this is not a summer day.

672
00:28:24,167 --> 00:28:25,133
The weather recently.

673
00:28:25,233 --> 00:28:27,867
This is the perfect day to have this itinerary.

674
00:28:27,967 --> 00:28:30,733
Yeah, I'd die if the weather is hotter

675
00:28:30,833 --> 00:28:31,800
I agree.

676
00:28:32,533 --> 00:28:33,600
Let me ask you something.

677
00:28:33,700 --> 00:28:37,367
Do you guys think the people we met here

678
00:28:37,467 --> 00:28:39,633
that they all cherish this experience?

679
00:28:39,733 --> 00:28:41,200
For example, you said there weren't bad guys

680
00:28:41,300 --> 00:28:43,400
that they are all good people?

681
00:28:43,500 --> 00:28:43,933
Yes, I believe that

682
00:28:44,033 --> 00:28:45,733
I felt so comfortable

683
00:28:45,833 --> 00:28:47,700
during these conversations these couple of days.

684
00:28:47,800 --> 00:28:48,300
That is exactly the reason

685
00:28:48,400 --> 00:28:50,367
why it made me so anxious yesterday.

686
00:28:50,467 --> 00:28:53,067
No matter who is going to leave

687
00:28:53,167 --> 00:28:55,200
I'd feel bad about it.

688
00:28:55,300 --> 00:28:58,767
True, we are all here by fate.

689
00:29:00,433 --> 00:29:01,667
See, look at that

690
00:29:01,767 --> 00:29:04,567
they even used garlic or scallion parts for soup.

691
00:29:04,967 --> 00:29:08,133
I like how you observed the little details

692
00:29:08,233 --> 00:29:10,867
of each course.

693
00:29:11,400 --> 00:29:14,267
(NIO observed the unique quality of Shih-Feng's)
That's what I will do when eating.

694
00:29:14,367 --> 00:29:15,733
Yeah.

695
00:29:16,467 --> 00:29:18,367
Actually, when we went on this date

696
00:29:18,467 --> 00:29:21,300
there was some attraction toward him

697
00:29:21,400 --> 00:29:24,567
I think Shih-Feng kind of grows on me

698
00:29:24,667 --> 00:29:26,733
I think, right in front of him

699
00:29:26,833 --> 00:29:30,467
I get more comfortable showing who I really am.

700
00:29:30,567 --> 00:29:33,367
Even if I have some doubts about certain things

701
00:29:33,467 --> 00:29:35,767
he answered me in a very genuine way.

702
00:29:35,967 --> 00:29:37,500
There was this time with my best friends

703
00:29:37,600 --> 00:29:39,767
we talked about what kind of person I am.

704
00:29:39,867 --> 00:29:42,867
They think everything is giant in my world

705
00:29:42,967 --> 00:29:45,133
I mean, how I feel things

706
00:29:45,233 --> 00:29:46,633
I am sensitive.

707
00:29:46,733 --> 00:29:47,900
Yeah.

708
00:29:48,033 --> 00:29:50,400
That's nice, too
But would you get tired from that?

709
00:29:50,500 --> 00:29:51,333
It is hard.

710
00:29:51,433 --> 00:29:54,133
But it has its advantages
My happiness is enlarged as well.

711
00:29:55,367 --> 00:29:56,200
To be completely honest

712
00:29:56,300 --> 00:29:59,267
I think I change my perspectives
on Shih-Feng a little.

713
00:29:59,367 --> 00:30:02,633
Yeah, I didn't feel anything
towards him originally.

714
00:30:02,733 --> 00:30:04,900
Nothing bad as well.

715
00:30:05,000 --> 00:30:08,067
He always lets his emotions out

716
00:30:08,167 --> 00:30:09,267
so that everyone knows.

717
00:30:09,367 --> 00:30:12,733
That's the part I like about him the most.

718
00:30:12,900 --> 00:30:15,300
One more, 1 2.

719
00:30:16,267 --> 00:30:17,800
I like it.

720
00:30:17,900 --> 00:30:18,800
(Shu-Fung, who's so passionate, is catching everyone's attention...)
I'll take another one.

721
00:30:18,900 --> 00:30:19,933
Absolutely.

722
00:30:23,100 --> 00:30:25,400
Me and NIO are so alike.

723
00:30:25,500 --> 00:30:27,300
To a point I think it's scary.

724
00:30:27,400 --> 00:30:29,533
Yeah, a lot of times when he finishes talking

725
00:30:29,633 --> 00:30:31,367
I just have to say I agree.

726
00:30:31,467 --> 00:30:32,433
There is no need

727
00:30:32,533 --> 00:30:35,100
to add other stuff that's my own opinions.

728
00:30:35,367 --> 00:30:36,600
The whole conversation would turn into

729
00:30:37,100 --> 00:30:38,067
three-people topics.

730
00:30:38,167 --> 00:30:39,800
And my only job is to stand there and nod.

731
00:30:39,900 --> 00:30:40,400
Yeah.

732
00:30:42,067 --> 00:30:45,867
(The dynamic has changed delicately
after the time they spent this afternoon...)

733
00:30:47,067 --> 00:30:49,400
(Tauchung Dragon Vally Hotel and Paradise)

734
00:30:49,500 --> 00:30:50,700
I ate so much food

735
00:30:50,800 --> 00:30:51,867
I have a belly now.

736
00:30:52,233 --> 00:30:52,800
That's fine.

737
00:30:52,900 --> 00:30:54,933
It's not fine. I'm a coach.

738
00:30:55,267 --> 00:30:56,833
No one would want me to be their coach.

739
00:30:56,933 --> 00:30:58,500
Plus, I didn't train myself recently.

740
00:31:02,967 --> 00:31:06,200
(Guan-Yu and Gino visit Dragon Vally Hotel and Paradise)

741
00:31:06,300 --> 00:31:07,200
Are you nervous?

742
00:31:07,500 --> 00:31:09,300
Nervous? I've never done this with anyone

743
00:31:09,400 --> 00:31:11,667
except for my boyfriend.

744
00:31:12,600 --> 00:31:13,967
Do you mean the hot springs?

745
00:31:14,067 --> 00:31:15,733
The public pool.

746
00:31:19,500 --> 00:31:20,800
What are you looking at?

747
00:31:21,133 --> 00:31:22,600
Why do you keep staring?

748
00:31:22,700 --> 00:31:24,900
Well, I don't get to see it often.

749
00:31:25,400 --> 00:31:27,167
It's only my second time.

750
00:31:27,267 --> 00:31:28,800
- You mean yesterday?
- Yeah.

751
00:31:28,900 --> 00:31:31,233
- What? You want to pinch me?
- I'm good.

752
00:31:32,733 --> 00:31:35,633
(Would this "naked" dating speed up their relationship?)

753
00:31:36,600 --> 00:31:37,433
(Gino can't hide his own joy...)

754
00:31:37,533 --> 00:31:39,233
Stop staring at me.

755
00:31:44,300 --> 00:31:46,967
Gosh, you are really shy.

756
00:31:47,500 --> 00:31:48,600
So adorable.

757
00:31:48,700 --> 00:31:50,433
Cut that.

758
00:31:54,900 --> 00:31:56,867
- Why'd you do that?
- Is it a hard one?

759
00:31:56,967 --> 00:31:59,133
- You hit me.
- Is it hard? I don't think so.

760
00:32:02,700 --> 00:32:04,467
Gosh, you really did learn a lot of flirty stuff.

761
00:32:04,567 --> 00:32:06,767
Excuse me? Massaging your head is flirty?

762
00:32:06,867 --> 00:32:08,700
It is for flirting.

763
00:32:08,933 --> 00:32:09,567
Do you mean this?

764
00:32:09,667 --> 00:32:10,733
Yeah.

765
00:32:11,367 --> 00:32:11,800
Gosh

766
00:32:11,900 --> 00:32:14,000
I realize you are really weird.

767
00:32:14,100 --> 00:32:16,267
You are the dirtiest one.

768
00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:28,433
It feels amazing
It's been a while since I went to the hot springs.

769
00:32:28,533 --> 00:32:29,933
My body feels great.

770
00:32:34,833 --> 00:32:41,800
Then how do you deal with
the pressure of those comments as an influencer?

771
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:43,600
Dealing with the pressure...

772
00:32:43,700 --> 00:32:44,767
(Gino shares how he deals with the comments as an influencer)
I'll take it if the comment is positive

773
00:32:44,867 --> 00:32:50,700
I'll improve if the comment is more negative.

774
00:32:51,500 --> 00:32:52,567
So honestly

775
00:32:52,667 --> 00:32:57,600
I get to manage my platform in a calmer way.

776
00:32:57,867 --> 00:32:59,433
So if you are an influencer

777
00:32:59,533 --> 00:33:01,567
what kind of influencers would it be?

778
00:33:02,233 --> 00:33:03,500
I've always wanted to do a photo book

779
00:33:03,600 --> 00:33:05,100
but I'm not muscular enough

780
00:33:05,400 --> 00:33:07,800
I feel like you really value
other people's opinions

781
00:33:07,900 --> 00:33:09,067
I think I do

782
00:33:09,167 --> 00:33:11,833
and I'm doing something to change that.

783
00:33:11,933 --> 00:33:13,900
How are you changing it?

784
00:33:14,333 --> 00:33:15,700
Accept its imperfections.

785
00:33:15,800 --> 00:33:17,500
After all, they are all part of me.

786
00:33:17,600 --> 00:33:18,967
Yeah, because the world is huge.

787
00:33:19,067 --> 00:33:21,500
You don't have to cater to everyone's needs.

788
00:33:21,600 --> 00:33:24,867
To live up to their expectations.

789
00:33:24,967 --> 00:33:29,067
Just to keep those whom you really like.

790
00:33:29,500 --> 00:33:31,233
Yeah, I've been thinking about it?

791
00:33:31,333 --> 00:33:33,767
(Question/What do you think about Gino's identity online?)
I think our lifestyles are probably very different.

792
00:33:34,767 --> 00:33:36,967
But I feel like we can always talk about it.

793
00:33:37,067 --> 00:33:37,533
Yeah...

794
00:33:37,633 --> 00:33:40,100
We can't just block out the whole relationship

795
00:33:40,200 --> 00:33:42,533
during some minor issues.

796
00:33:43,700 --> 00:33:45,967
Actually, a couple of days ago
I did notice that.

797
00:33:46,067 --> 00:33:47,333
Why would you know?

798
00:33:47,433 --> 00:33:51,300
Your pants are a bit tight so I noticed...

799
00:33:51,833 --> 00:33:53,900
that it was quite large.

800
00:33:54,400 --> 00:33:56,533
(They start to talk about other topics...)
Who would just look at it randomly?

801
00:33:56,633 --> 00:33:57,900
Some pervert I guess.

802
00:33:59,200 --> 00:34:00,833
Why would you look at it?

803
00:34:01,067 --> 00:34:02,433
- Because you were sitting.
- So you wanted to look at it?

804
00:34:02,533 --> 00:34:06,133
Nah, just randomly checking.

805
00:34:06,233 --> 00:34:07,800
Unless you didn't peek at all

806
00:34:07,900 --> 00:34:09,000
I did not, actually

807
00:34:09,200 --> 00:34:11,467
I was busy meeting new people.

808
00:34:11,733 --> 00:34:12,400
Interesting.

809
00:34:12,500 --> 00:34:15,033
Nah, just teasing him a little.

810
00:34:15,133 --> 00:34:16,967
Yeah, fooling around.

811
00:34:17,067 --> 00:34:20,733
Who would peek at others' trousers during the date?

812
00:34:20,833 --> 00:34:23,267
I get spooked by people who are more active

813
00:34:23,367 --> 00:34:25,433
but I don't dislike them
They are alright.

814
00:34:25,533 --> 00:34:27,733
(Question/What do you think about Gino's actions?)
I realize he is just like a kid.

815
00:34:27,833 --> 00:34:31,567
Like poking my pennis
or not wearing any clothes.

816
00:34:31,667 --> 00:34:36,033
Or he would just act cute sometimes.

817
00:34:36,133 --> 00:34:38,800
Those actions do come from his heart.

818
00:34:44,133 --> 00:34:44,667
Gosh, you...

819
00:34:44,767 --> 00:34:46,067
(They walk to the outside pool)
I wouldn't do that.

820
00:34:46,167 --> 00:34:47,367
God, I've changed my opinions on you.

821
00:34:47,467 --> 00:34:48,400
You have?

822
00:34:48,500 --> 00:34:49,733
Totally change of perspectives.

823
00:34:49,833 --> 00:34:51,067
Not scared at all.

824
00:35:05,800 --> 00:35:07,833
Don't you think I'm childish?

825
00:35:07,933 --> 00:35:09,467
Childish? About what?

826
00:35:09,567 --> 00:35:11,367
(Guan-Yu brought up the question of age gap...)
Because I would feel like is it...

827
00:35:11,467 --> 00:35:13,300
I think you are mature enough

828
00:35:13,400 --> 00:35:15,933
at the age group of yours.

829
00:35:16,033 --> 00:35:18,533
Yeah, I'm a big kid after all.

830
00:35:19,100 --> 00:35:21,967
Yeah, we can all actually loosen up a little.

831
00:35:22,067 --> 00:35:24,767
- We don't have to work that hard.
- True.

832
00:35:24,867 --> 00:35:27,900
- Sometimes we can take easy on life.
- That's right.

833
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:29,267
That's also a great way to live.

834
00:35:29,700 --> 00:35:30,167
I agree.

835
00:35:30,267 --> 00:35:31,333
You are awesome.

836
00:35:31,600 --> 00:35:32,600
Keep going.

837
00:35:34,433 --> 00:35:36,400
I would think that's an issue before.

838
00:35:36,500 --> 00:35:38,033
(Question/Would you mind age gap?)
I'd worry if someone thinks I'm childish

839
00:35:38,133 --> 00:35:41,433
or whether we have different financial capabilities.

840
00:35:42,533 --> 00:35:43,833
Then I've discovered

841
00:35:43,933 --> 00:35:45,800
that we just need to talk it out.

842
00:35:46,133 --> 00:35:48,767
You kind of look cute with bangs.

843
00:35:49,433 --> 00:35:51,100
Because it usually goes back.

844
00:35:52,767 --> 00:35:53,367
That will do.

845
00:35:53,467 --> 00:35:54,667
That will do?

846
00:35:54,767 --> 00:35:56,800
Alright, then.

847
00:35:57,900 --> 00:35:59,367
Did you have fun today?

848
00:35:59,467 --> 00:35:59,967
I did.

849
00:36:00,067 --> 00:36:00,800
On a scale of one to ten.

850
00:36:00,900 --> 00:36:01,867
Nine

851
00:36:01,967 --> 00:36:02,733
I had ten.

852
00:36:02,833 --> 00:36:04,333
Seriously? Full score?

853
00:36:04,433 --> 00:36:04,800
Yeah.

854
00:36:04,900 --> 00:36:06,400
Look over there.

855
00:36:06,500 --> 00:36:08,133
Did you see that? A monkey.

856
00:36:08,233 --> 00:36:09,367
There's a monkey.

857
00:36:09,467 --> 00:36:10,467
You are the monkey

858
00:36:10,567 --> 00:36:12,400
I mean it, there's a monkey over there.

859
00:36:12,500 --> 00:36:12,967
Where?

860
00:36:13,067 --> 00:36:14,700
Over the trees.

861
00:36:16,433 --> 00:36:17,433
Where?

862
00:36:17,533 --> 00:36:18,200
There

863
00:36:18,300 --> 00:36:19,533
(locking eyes all of a sudden)

864
00:36:19,633 --> 00:36:20,800
Didn't the movie play like this?

865
00:36:20,900 --> 00:36:22,467
I pointed and you turned your head around.

866
00:36:22,567 --> 00:36:24,833
Are you into this kind of drama scene?

867
00:36:24,933 --> 00:36:26,700
Come on, I'm a grown-up kid.

868
00:36:26,800 --> 00:36:28,000
Of course, I watched all the drama series.

869
00:36:28,100 --> 00:36:29,200
My gosh.

870
00:36:31,600 --> 00:36:33,133
Cigarette is not great for health

871
00:36:33,467 --> 00:36:35,100
(click)

872
00:36:36,433 --> 00:36:38,200
Don't worry.

873
00:36:38,300 --> 00:36:39,633
Never mind.

874
00:36:40,267 --> 00:36:43,133
It is really terrifying
I'll snap it.

875
00:36:44,533 --> 00:36:46,267
This is like a small market.

876
00:36:46,367 --> 00:36:47,300
(Taichung, Fourth Public Retail Marke)
Have you done this before?

877
00:36:47,400 --> 00:36:48,067
I have never.

878
00:36:48,167 --> 00:36:50,100
But I've always wanted to try.

879
00:36:50,200 --> 00:36:52,900
Yeah, you have to knit your own yarn.

880
00:36:53,000 --> 00:36:54,133
Look at that.

881
00:36:54,233 --> 00:36:56,133
Goose.

882
00:37:00,333 --> 00:37:03,100
(Bobo and Eri are making year slippers)
We are doing slippers today.

883
00:37:03,567 --> 00:37:07,067
That's why we are gonna do it
on the smaller board?

884
00:37:07,167 --> 00:37:07,933
That's right.

885
00:37:08,033 --> 00:37:08,933
OK

886
00:37:09,033 --> 00:37:10,233
Teacher, how would I use it?

887
00:37:10,333 --> 00:37:11,633
Alright, I'll teach you.

888
00:37:11,733 --> 00:37:13,533
You could make a cross over here.

889
00:37:13,633 --> 00:37:14,167
A cross.

890
00:37:14,267 --> 00:37:15,433
Come over here.

891
00:37:15,600 --> 00:37:17,300
Go help him, through this hole.

892
00:37:17,400 --> 00:37:19,000
Teacher, do we look like couples?

893
00:37:19,100 --> 00:37:19,700
Yes

894
00:37:19,800 --> 00:37:21,100
(helpless)
Seriously?

895
00:37:21,533 --> 00:37:23,300
It's too tight

896
00:37:23,400 --> 00:37:23,933
I think...

897
00:37:24,033 --> 00:37:27,333
Teacher, his body is too fit

898
00:37:27,733 --> 00:37:28,467
(starting from the scratch)

899
00:37:28,567 --> 00:37:30,567
Have you come up with your idea?

900
00:37:30,667 --> 00:37:33,367
I have, but I need to apologize first.

901
00:37:33,467 --> 00:37:34,567
Today is our dating

902
00:37:34,667 --> 00:37:37,367
but I might not gift it to you

903
00:37:37,467 --> 00:37:38,267
I don't care.

904
00:37:38,367 --> 00:37:41,100
Yeah, right, I'm gonna

905
00:37:41,200 --> 00:37:43,067
I think you know who I am talking about.

906
00:37:43,167 --> 00:37:44,700
(Whom is Eri giving it to?)
I know how he is, I'm aware.

907
00:37:44,800 --> 00:37:46,967
Yeah, he often helps us

908
00:37:47,067 --> 00:37:48,700
take some weird photos.

909
00:37:48,800 --> 00:37:51,400
Like parted lips or tiled eyes.

910
00:37:51,500 --> 00:37:54,500
That's why I'm separating our facial features

911
00:37:54,600 --> 00:37:57,767
and make it like Picasso.

912
00:37:57,867 --> 00:38:01,033
Then put your scratch on this thing.

913
00:38:01,133 --> 00:38:02,400
What did you draw then?

914
00:38:02,500 --> 00:38:05,033
They are my kittens

915
00:38:05,133 --> 00:38:07,633
I had two cats before.

916
00:38:07,733 --> 00:38:10,667
One is Russian Blue and one was mixed race.

917
00:38:10,767 --> 00:38:12,633
The mixed one died a while ago.

918
00:38:12,733 --> 00:38:15,200
So I want to draw my cats.

919
00:38:15,300 --> 00:38:17,433
A way to remember him.

920
00:38:18,533 --> 00:38:19,867
Then what about the other side.

921
00:38:19,967 --> 00:38:21,667
Extending what's on the other side

922
00:38:21,767 --> 00:38:24,433
I have a smile over here.

923
00:38:24,533 --> 00:38:26,267
Because NIO loves to smile.

924
00:38:26,367 --> 00:38:27,500
"The smile of a super idol."

925
00:38:27,600 --> 00:38:28,900
"None of that can compare to NIO."

926
00:38:31,200 --> 00:38:32,900
Right, and the other side is...

927
00:38:33,000 --> 00:38:34,833
It's the smile.

928
00:38:36,967 --> 00:38:39,833
(They are talking about the gifts for "each other")

929
00:38:45,267 --> 00:38:48,700
Going through the hole and pulling it out.

930
00:38:49,167 --> 00:38:49,533
Alright.

931
00:38:49,633 --> 00:38:51,067
Teacher, if my work isn't pretty.

932
00:38:51,167 --> 00:38:52,333
Will you save me?

933
00:38:52,433 --> 00:38:53,400
Yes.

934
00:38:57,167 --> 00:38:59,600
The truth is, the reason why
I gift my slippers to him

935
00:38:59,700 --> 00:39:01,667
is because I did this whole work.

936
00:39:01,767 --> 00:39:04,767
Whether I put it at my place

937
00:39:04,867 --> 00:39:06,400
or at his place

938
00:39:06,500 --> 00:39:10,167
it'll always be NIO's name all over here.

939
00:39:10,567 --> 00:39:11,600
Yeah.

940
00:39:13,967 --> 00:39:16,433
So you're not gifting it to anyone?

941
00:39:16,967 --> 00:39:18,600
Still thinking about it.

942
00:39:19,033 --> 00:39:21,267
Because there are only
two people knowing this story.

943
00:39:21,367 --> 00:39:23,700
One is you and I don't want to
talk about the other one.

944
00:39:23,767 --> 00:39:25,300
(Who's another one knowing this kitten story?)

945
00:39:25,300 --> 00:39:26,933
Now I got it.

946
00:39:29,400 --> 00:39:32,500
Then I want one chili sauce latte.

947
00:39:33,300 --> 00:39:35,900
And I want a box of mochi

948
00:39:36,000 --> 00:39:38,167
because we are besties

949
00:39:40,867 --> 00:39:45,800
(tasting the Taichung chili sauce latte)

950
00:39:46,467 --> 00:39:47,967
Gosh, this is...

951
00:39:52,067 --> 00:39:53,300
I think it tastes incredible.

952
00:39:53,400 --> 00:39:54,933
Probably because I'm from Taichung

953
00:39:55,033 --> 00:39:57,000
I kind of like Taichung chili sauce.

954
00:39:57,100 --> 00:39:58,767
Mochi.

955
00:39:59,033 --> 00:39:59,967
One for one

956
00:40:00,067 --> 00:40:01,267
like we are besties

957
00:40:01,367 --> 00:40:04,733
(reading each other's mind)
Look at this teamwork, that's what I'm talking about.

958
00:40:04,867 --> 00:40:08,433
My choice today makes me realize

959
00:40:08,533 --> 00:40:09,667
that even though it's not love

960
00:40:09,767 --> 00:40:11,933
but I think this friendship

961
00:40:12,367 --> 00:40:15,600
is far more important than
going out with NIO today.

962
00:40:15,800 --> 00:40:17,400
Yeah, I'm over the moon.

963
00:40:22,833 --> 00:40:26,100
I think Eri is probably the best thing I get

964
00:40:26,200 --> 00:40:27,433
from this journey

965
00:40:27,533 --> 00:40:31,567
I found my bestie
and we know each other by heart

966
00:40:32,600 --> 00:40:36,567
(finish this blueprint by sewing with yarn by yarn)

967
00:40:42,867 --> 00:40:45,533
(Who would receive this special gift...?)

968
00:40:50,600 --> 00:40:53,267
(Taichung Reindeer herb house)

969
00:40:54,967 --> 00:40:56,767
So what Taiwanese songs do you want to sing?

970
00:40:56,867 --> 00:40:58,033
I don't know how to choose.

971
00:40:58,133 --> 00:41:00,600
The song that the four of us would know.

972
00:41:00,700 --> 00:41:01,500
It's hard.

973
00:41:01,600 --> 00:41:02,033
Super hard.

974
00:41:02,133 --> 00:41:03,833
Personally, I know every A-Mei song by heart.

975
00:41:03,933 --> 00:41:05,300
Alright, let's sing her songs.

976
00:41:05,400 --> 00:41:06,267
Do you know A-Mei's song?

977
00:41:06,367 --> 00:41:08,267
Probably that "Three Days and Three Nights"

978
00:41:08,700 --> 00:41:09,500
(Four of them sing happily together this afternoon)
Got it.

979
00:41:09,900 --> 00:41:10,667
Is it downloading?

980
00:41:10,767 --> 00:41:11,800
Turn it up a little

981
00:41:11,900 --> 00:41:14,167
I'm not tired at all

982
00:41:15,067 --> 00:41:18,533
I've already danced for three days.

983
00:41:22,367 --> 00:41:24,333
Singing is fun and everyone is enjoying it.

984
00:41:24,433 --> 00:41:26,467
Besides, everyone sounds amazing.

985
00:41:26,567 --> 00:41:27,933
Especially NIO, he is a singer

986
00:41:28,033 --> 00:41:31,933
and Susu's voice sounds great, too.

987
00:41:32,033 --> 00:41:33,733
Shih-Feng gets sucked into the moment.

988
00:41:39,000 --> 00:41:40,700
Original key.

989
00:41:40,800 --> 00:41:42,000
You mean playing this?

990
00:41:42,100 --> 00:41:43,433
B 2543

991
00:41:43,533 --> 00:41:46,400
It sucks.

992
00:41:46,500 --> 00:41:47,400
Shut up

993
00:41:47,500 --> 00:41:50,400
I noticed that Taiwanese
often have a conversation

994
00:41:50,500 --> 00:41:52,700
probably with my Taiwanese friends on the road.

995
00:41:52,800 --> 00:41:54,133
People talk about

996
00:41:54,233 --> 00:41:56,767
what songs we want to play in karaoke.

997
00:41:56,867 --> 00:41:59,833
And people seem to know
which songs are the best

998
00:41:59,933 --> 00:42:01,367
I want to promote a feature.

999
00:42:01,467 --> 00:42:03,667
When I'm attending a singing contest

1000
00:42:03,767 --> 00:42:06,133
I use Happy Sing app to record

1001
00:42:06,233 --> 00:42:09,067
convert it to MP3
and send it to the contest crew.

1002
00:42:09,167 --> 00:42:12,333
Besides, Happy Sing can lower a pitch.

1003
00:42:12,433 --> 00:42:14,167
This sounds like a great feature.

1004
00:42:18,267 --> 00:42:22,100
(they are all singing hard while discovering each other's great voices...)

1005
00:42:22,200 --> 00:42:24,500
My throat is warm and I just want to sing.

1006
00:42:24,600 --> 00:42:25,400
And secondly, because

1007
00:42:25,500 --> 00:42:26,933
I realize there are some songs

1008
00:42:27,033 --> 00:42:28,533
I want to sing with him.

1009
00:42:28,633 --> 00:42:29,800
The singing sound of Shih-Feng

1010
00:42:29,900 --> 00:42:32,733
is different from how he talks.

1011
00:42:32,833 --> 00:42:34,767
Since I love hearing other people's voice

1012
00:42:34,867 --> 00:42:37,100
when I heard him sing, I got a little...

1013
00:42:37,200 --> 00:42:38,733
He was attractive to me.

1014
00:42:38,833 --> 00:42:41,100
(Shih-Feng's voice is attractive to Susu...)
During this whole afternoon

1015
00:42:41,200 --> 00:42:42,467
it feels like I've been resolving around him.

1016
00:42:53,067 --> 00:42:54,600
The four of us didn't get a match

1017
00:42:54,700 --> 00:42:55,400
so we hung out.

1018
00:42:55,500 --> 00:42:58,200
(Question/Getting closer with Susu?)
There were times when his body was closer to mine

1019
00:42:58,300 --> 00:43:00,400
I thought I wouldn't feel something

1020
00:43:00,500 --> 00:43:01,767
but later I kind of feel like

1021
00:43:01,867 --> 00:43:05,100
I like the idea of him being around me.

1022
00:43:05,833 --> 00:43:06,733
After our chat

1023
00:43:06,833 --> 00:43:10,367
I discover that we think alike most of the time.

1024
00:43:10,467 --> 00:43:12,133
Not that we are impossible.

1025
00:43:13,367 --> 00:43:16,333
After the singing session.

1026
00:43:16,433 --> 00:43:19,200
Susu stayed there with me.

1027
00:43:19,667 --> 00:43:23,400
This is the first time I feel that Susu

1028
00:43:23,500 --> 00:43:26,367
isn't against the idea of touching me.

1029
00:43:26,467 --> 00:43:27,867
Not that getting into something very fast

1030
00:43:27,967 --> 00:43:31,133
but there seems to be something.

1031
00:43:31,233 --> 00:43:33,100
Well, we sang together.

1032
00:43:33,200 --> 00:43:35,733
And he made me feel like

1033
00:43:35,833 --> 00:43:37,500
he stayed with me

1034
00:43:37,600 --> 00:43:38,400
I have no idea why.

1035
00:43:38,467 --> 00:43:42,400
(Would those four who stayed on the site
change the current dynamics...)

1036
00:43:55,600 --> 00:43:56,533
Right?

1037
00:43:56,733 --> 00:43:57,333
Super.

1038
00:43:57,433 --> 00:43:59,833
So adorable, I don't know
I got them in a vintage shop

1039
00:44:01,233 --> 00:44:02,867
(winking)

1040
00:44:04,367 --> 00:44:05,433
They are back.

1041
00:44:06,133 --> 00:44:07,400
(Bobo and Eri went back to the cabin)
Welcome.

1042
00:44:07,500 --> 00:44:10,033
Looks like you had many itineraries

1043
00:44:10,133 --> 00:44:11,500
I'm exhausted.

1044
00:44:11,600 --> 00:44:13,200
To a point I don't want to talk.

1045
00:44:13,300 --> 00:44:15,033
Go and get some rest.

1046
00:44:18,567 --> 00:44:20,333
Where did you guys go? Can you say?

1047
00:44:20,433 --> 00:44:21,400
Yizhong Street.

1048
00:44:21,500 --> 00:44:24,067
- Well, dating.
- A whole day itineraries.

1049
00:44:27,367 --> 00:44:28,967
Seems like they are back as well.

1050
00:44:29,067 --> 00:44:31,633
Aw, I love watching them.

1051
00:44:31,967 --> 00:44:33,400
They went to different places.

1052
00:44:33,500 --> 00:44:35,333
- Yeah, different ones.
- Absolutely.

1053
00:44:35,433 --> 00:44:40,333
(Guan-Yu and Gino are back)

1054
00:44:46,400 --> 00:44:50,167
(Bobo took a look at Guan-Yu and Gino
and decided to go back to his room)

1055
00:44:50,733 --> 00:44:52,433
What are you guys doing?

1056
00:44:53,233 --> 00:44:54,000
Just chilling

1057
00:44:54,467 --> 00:44:57,767
I've had enough
I want to go home

1058
00:44:57,867 --> 00:44:58,633
I mean, it's possible that.

1059
00:44:58,733 --> 00:45:02,867
(Bobo blurts out that he wants to leave...)
If I stay any longer, I think I will be upset

1060
00:45:02,967 --> 00:45:04,600
I don't think so

1061
00:45:04,700 --> 00:45:05,367
I have to say.

1062
00:45:05,467 --> 00:45:08,433
(Gino is seeking other members for help...)
when I said I wanted to talk to Bobo.

1063
00:45:08,533 --> 00:45:09,967
He rejected me.

1064
00:45:10,067 --> 00:45:12,333
How's that possible? Bobo didn't respond?

1065
00:45:12,433 --> 00:45:14,133
Even when I set foot in there

1066
00:45:14,233 --> 00:45:16,933
he said he wanted to leave if that was okay.

1067
00:45:19,867 --> 00:45:22,933
(What would happen on the night when someone has to leave...?)

1068
00:45:23,433 --> 00:45:26,467
Please take your recorders

1069
00:45:26,567 --> 00:45:29,367
and record if this is my last day here

1070
00:45:29,467 --> 00:45:31,267
what would you say to everyone

1071
00:45:31,367 --> 00:45:35,233
I'm happy to meet you guys on this journey.

1072
00:45:35,333 --> 00:45:38,400
See you guys if we are meant to be

1073
00:45:38,500 --> 00:45:40,900
I appreciate those memories you gave to me.

1074
00:45:41,000 --> 00:45:42,633
Thank you, guys

1075
00:45:42,733 --> 00:45:43,967
I love you guys.

1076
00:45:44,067 --> 00:45:48,133
Play the recordings and confirm the last result.

1077
00:45:51,600 --> 00:46:01,600
(Who will leave the cabin tonight?
Whose last recordings will be put on...?)
