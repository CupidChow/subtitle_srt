I'm so stressed right now.

Is it a girl?

Who is it exactly?

6
00:00:15,234 --> 00:00:16,400
Everybody

7
00:00:16,500 --> 00:00:18,167
I'm gonna cry.

8
00:00:19,967 --> 00:00:20,934
This can't be happening

(screaming all over...)

10
00:00:23,167 --> 00:00:24,734
Gosh.

00:00:24,834 --> 00:00:26,700

What a blissful man you are, huh.

Yeah.

- Alright.
- Absolutely.

or some matching activity with our tenth guest.

No, it turned out it was Abao.

I had no idea the crew was this good at finding us a guest.

You guys really paid attention.

Thanks.

- Can I take pictures?
- Taking pictures of me?

48
00:01:59,800 --> 00:02:01,034
- Yeah.
- Aren't you hungry?

49
00:02:01,134 --> 00:02:03,234
- Not really, I'm full just by looking at you.
- Eat first

there was another new member

I'm pretty hyped.

56
00:02:13,434 --> 00:02:15,734
Because I knew Abao already.

57
00:02:15,834 --> 00:02:17,767

It sounds crunchy.

66
00:02:30,167 --> 00:02:30,900
What's your name?

67
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:31,900
I'm Shih-Feng.

68
00:02:32,134 --> 00:02:33,767
Fung-Fung, Susu.

69
00:02:33,867 --> 00:02:35,100
NIO, and you

70
00:02:35,200 --> 00:02:35,834
I'm Guan-Yu

71
00:02:35,934 --> 00:02:38,200
I've been living in Taitung for five years

72
00:02:38,300 --> 00:02:40,000
because I went to study there.

73
00:02:40,100 --> 00:02:41,067
What school were you in?

74
00:02:41,167 --> 00:02:42,067

75
00:02:42,867 --> 00:02:44,500
Don't tell me you were in the music department.

00:02:44,600 --> 00:02:45,334
Oh my god.

77
00:02:45,434 --> 00:02:47,200
So I'm very excited... to see you.

78
00:02:47,300 --> 00:02:47,834

Whenever I'm drunk

88
00:02:59,400 --> 00:03:00,400
YouTube I'll open YouTube channel

89
00:03:00,500 --> 00:03:01,700
and just start to cry nonstop.

90
00:03:02,234 --> 00:03:03,534
Don't say that.

91
00:03:03,634 --> 00:03:04,734
Alright, your turn.

92
00:03:04,834 --> 00:03:06,267
Gino.

93
00:03:06,367 --> 00:03:07,300
And what about you?

94
00:03:07,400 --> 00:03:08,634
I'm Bobo.

95
00:03:08,734 --> 00:03:09,467
Bobo.

96
00:03:09,567 --> 00:03:10,500
You've been working out.

97
00:03:10,600 --> 00:03:11,267
Yeah, I have.

98
00:03:11,367 --> 00:03:12,134
Then why did you...

99
00:03:12,234 --> 00:03:13,634
If you work out
don't take it the wrong way

100
00:03:13,734 --> 00:03:14,967
wouldn't it be too tight?

101
00:03:15,067 --> 00:03:16,067
Loose one button.

102
00:03:16,167 --> 00:03:17,467
Yeah, yeah.

103
00:03:19,634 --> 00:03:21,034
Come on, lose two instead.

104
00:03:21,900 --> 00:03:23,200
Three buttons... three

105
00:03:23,300 --> 00:03:24,734
I'm just kidding.

106
00:03:25,467 --> 00:03:26,567
Right, it's your turn now
The most beautiful one

107
00:03:26,667 --> 00:03:27,467
I'm Eri.

108
00:03:27,567 --> 00:03:28,567
Eri.

109
00:03:29,400 --> 00:03:32,567
Apparently, you already knew how I am.

110
00:03:32,667 --> 00:03:34,267
And.

111
00:03:34,367 --> 00:03:36,867
That's it. Just stop moving.

112
00:03:36,967 --> 00:03:39,500
You look cute and very natural.

113
00:03:39,967 --> 00:03:41,834
Help him fix that. It is slipping away.

114
00:03:41,934 --> 00:03:43,734
Look at you, showing off in front of Abao.

115
00:03:43,834 --> 00:03:45,300
Hey.

116
00:03:45,400 --> 00:03:46,700
- Undoubtedly.
- I'm not even a member of your team.

117
00:03:46,800 --> 00:03:48,667
What's there to show off?

118
00:03:48,767 --> 00:03:51,567
Am I the mother-in-law
to keep the scores for you?

119
00:03:51,667 --> 00:03:53,800
- Thank you.
- Thanks.

120
00:03:53,900 --> 00:03:55,000
Alright.

121
00:03:55,100 --> 00:03:56,267
Oh, the topic box

122
00:03:56,367 --> 00:03:57,467
(picking out the topic from the box)

123
00:03:57,567 --> 00:03:58,700
Abao, sorry to interrupt.

124
00:03:58,800 --> 00:04:01,034
Go ahead.

125
00:04:01,134 --> 00:04:03,167
Coming out and family.

126
00:04:03,267 --> 00:04:04,300
(The topic today: Coming out and family)
Does your family knows about this?

127
00:04:04,400 --> 00:04:06,067
That you guys joined this show?

128
00:04:06,167 --> 00:04:07,500
Fortunately, in my family

129
00:04:07,600 --> 00:04:09,000
they are pretty open-minded about this.

130
00:04:09,100 --> 00:04:10,100
So there hasn't been some...

131
00:04:10,200 --> 00:04:11,567
There hasn't been much concern about that.

132
00:04:11,667 --> 00:04:13,500
- Cool.
- They believe it's fine.

133
00:04:13,600 --> 00:04:15,100
(NIO was born in an open-minded family with lots of support and freedom)
as long as I'm happy.

134
00:04:15,200 --> 00:04:16,534
Good luck, with your job and everything.

135
00:04:16,634 --> 00:04:19,300
So they are fine with you making friends here?

136
00:04:19,400 --> 00:04:20,300
And also Susu is...

137
00:04:20,400 --> 00:04:22,434
More like, my parents have no control over me.

138
00:04:22,534 --> 00:04:24,367
They just let me do whatever I want to do.

139
00:04:24,467 --> 00:04:25,634
Yeah.

140
00:04:25,734 --> 00:04:27,334
In the beginning, my mom also thought

141
00:04:27,434 --> 00:04:28,600
being gay was unnatural.

142
00:04:28,700 --> 00:04:31,200
But after three to five years

143
00:04:31,300 --> 00:04:33,967
one day, there was this auntie saying

144
00:04:34,067 --> 00:04:35,100
your boy looked really cute.

145
00:04:35,200 --> 00:04:36,467
Did he have a girlfriend or something.

146
00:04:36,567 --> 00:04:38,500
When I hadn't said anything

147
00:04:38,600 --> 00:04:41,900
my mom said, "Oh, he liked boys."

148
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:43,467
That's amazing.

149
00:04:43,567 --> 00:04:45,067
She just helped you...

150
00:04:45,167 --> 00:04:47,467
(Shih-Feng's family gives him courage and time)
I think being different from the rest of the people

151
00:04:47,567 --> 00:04:48,867
takes a lot of courage.

152
00:04:48,967 --> 00:04:51,167
But this courage

153
00:04:51,267 --> 00:04:52,867
perhaps I got it

154
00:04:52,967 --> 00:04:54,567
from my mom and dad.

155
00:04:54,667 --> 00:04:56,834
You just need to give them more time.

156
00:04:56,934 --> 00:04:58,700
Actually, my mom already knew my sexuality

157
00:04:58,800 --> 00:04:59,534
a long time ago.

158
00:04:59,634 --> 00:05:00,634
How long was that?

159
00:05:00,734 --> 00:05:03,167
When I was in high school
there were some subtle clues

160
00:05:03,267 --> 00:05:03,800
she probably wondered

161
00:05:03,900 --> 00:05:05,500
how com I was always closer to boys.

162
00:05:05,600 --> 00:05:07,067
She chose not to say this.

163
00:05:07,167 --> 00:05:08,534
Pretending that she didn't know.

164
00:05:08,634 --> 00:05:11,134
Until one breakup when I was in college

165
00:05:11,234 --> 00:05:13,834
she took the initiative and asked how I was doing.

166
00:05:13,934 --> 00:05:15,000
And that was when I officially

167
00:05:15,100 --> 00:05:16,567
introduced my identity to her.

168
00:05:16,667 --> 00:05:18,100
Then she told me she already knew about it

169
00:05:18,200 --> 00:05:19,734
but she was willing to spend some time

170
00:05:19,834 --> 00:05:20,967
to let me process all of these.

171
00:05:21,067 --> 00:05:23,867
Well, my dad will wait and see after this show comes out.

172
00:05:25,500 --> 00:05:26,234
- He needs some more time.
- It sounds fantastic.

173
00:05:26,334 --> 00:05:28,434
It's a perfect show to watch with the family.

174
00:05:28,534 --> 00:05:29,200
He still needs some more time

175
00:05:29,300 --> 00:05:31,900
I'm gonna have to take our family's TV away.

176
00:05:33,367 --> 00:05:34,734
I wasn't cool about it initially

177
00:05:34,834 --> 00:05:36,667
I mean, me being a gay

178
00:05:36,767 --> 00:05:38,167
I bet you did something
to change her mind.

179
00:05:38,267 --> 00:05:41,067
To get her to understand you

180
00:05:41,167 --> 00:05:43,534
I let her know that I'm still her child.

181
00:05:43,634 --> 00:05:45,234
Because a while ago

182
00:05:45,334 --> 00:05:47,067
the COVIP still hits hard.

183
00:05:47,167 --> 00:05:48,400
My sister were working.

184
00:05:48,500 --> 00:05:49,900
To be honest, I took care of their lives

185
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:51,867
for her basically.

186
00:05:51,967 --> 00:05:53,034
Yeah, so she.

187
00:05:53,134 --> 00:05:55,500
She actually sent me a text

188
00:05:55,600 --> 00:05:57,367
(tearful)

189
00:05:57,467 --> 00:05:59,334
A-Duo.

190
00:06:00,034 --> 00:06:01,900
We've got the tissues ready
We gotta be pretty.

191
00:06:03,034 --> 00:06:06,800
She said she was grateful

192
00:06:08,200 --> 00:06:10,134
for the way I looked after them.

193
00:06:10,234 --> 00:06:12,667
And...

194
00:06:12,767 --> 00:06:14,334
that she still loves me.

195
00:06:19,900 --> 00:06:20,967
You are amazing.

196
00:06:22,834 --> 00:06:24,267
Wipe it off.

197
00:06:25,234 --> 00:06:26,767
Yes, you're amazing
It's not easy at all.

198
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:27,900
You've got that tissue, yeah.

199
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:29,267
That's alright, it's fine.

200
00:06:29,367 --> 00:06:30,734
Watery eyes are more pretty.

201
00:06:32,967 --> 00:06:35,200
The only thing I want is that my parents

202
00:06:35,300 --> 00:06:37,834
get to know me better.

203
00:06:37,934 --> 00:06:39,467
(Eri hopes his parents can know him better...)
instead thinking I've changed

204
00:06:39,567 --> 00:06:41,000
I didn't change at all

205
00:06:41,100 --> 00:06:43,200
I just want them to know me better

206
00:06:43,300 --> 00:06:45,334
so I chose to tell them.

207
00:06:45,434 --> 00:06:46,800
If I remember this correctly, I seem to

208
00:06:46,900 --> 00:06:48,567
have told this story to NIO.

209
00:06:48,667 --> 00:06:51,434
But when I was telling Abao the story today

210
00:06:51,534 --> 00:06:54,200
I was surprised that I'd cry like this

211
00:06:54,300 --> 00:06:55,834
I don't particularly into the idea

212
00:06:55,934 --> 00:06:58,100
that I get emotional in front of everyone.

213
00:06:58,567 --> 00:06:59,467
I think...

214
00:07:00,200 --> 00:07:00,800
(staring)

215
00:07:01,367 --> 00:07:02,234
(chewing)

216
00:07:02,334 --> 00:07:04,967
Bobo, stop eating

217
00:07:05,234 --> 00:07:06,100
I'm kidding

218
00:07:06,467 --> 00:07:07,200
I'cm starving.

219
00:07:07,300 --> 00:07:08,900
You can eat all you want

220
00:07:09,634 --> 00:07:11,667
(the joke eased the melancholy in the air)
I caught his eyes looking.

221
00:07:13,800 --> 00:07:15,000
Well, what about Gino?

222
00:07:15,100 --> 00:07:17,134
Does your family know you're here?

223
00:07:17,234 --> 00:07:18,034
They don't.

224
00:07:18,134 --> 00:07:19,834
Why didn't you tell them?

225
00:07:19,934 --> 00:07:21,534
I won't particularly tell them

226
00:07:21,634 --> 00:07:22,700
I published one photo book

227
00:07:22,800 --> 00:07:24,334
and I didn't share it with them.

228
00:07:24,434 --> 00:07:25,600
(Gino is afraid to share his things with the family...)
My family all knows about me.

229
00:07:25,700 --> 00:07:29,334
They don't really have the desire

230
00:07:29,434 --> 00:07:32,034
to know what happened in terms of my identity.

231
00:07:32,134 --> 00:07:34,000
Because seeing that

232
00:07:34,100 --> 00:07:37,067
wouldn't make them particularly happy.

233
00:07:37,167 --> 00:07:40,134
So I might as well don't tell them

234
00:07:40,234 --> 00:07:40,800
I think, slowly

235
00:07:40,900 --> 00:07:43,234
like our parents

236
00:07:43,334 --> 00:07:45,067
we are all heterosexual.

237
00:07:45,167 --> 00:07:47,167
But I've got a lot of friends around me

238
00:07:47,267 --> 00:07:48,434
who are queer people.

239
00:07:48,534 --> 00:07:51,600
Since I participate in performances a lot

240
00:07:51,700 --> 00:07:53,700
when parents are there to see it

241
00:07:53,800 --> 00:07:55,934
they later realize that, "Oh

242
00:07:56,034 --> 00:07:58,500
these kids are actually cute'

243
00:07:58,600 --> 00:08:01,000
And they'd tell me themselves

244
00:08:01,100 --> 00:08:03,034
that they are talented.

245
00:08:03,134 --> 00:08:05,167
So give them some more time.

246
00:08:05,267 --> 00:08:08,534
Bobo, your friend is crying
Give him a pat

247
00:08:09,267 --> 00:08:10,367
(comforting)
Alright.

248
00:08:10,467 --> 00:08:11,900
Give them some time.

249
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:13,567
Because I feel like

250
00:08:13,667 --> 00:08:15,734
sometimes parents are just...

251
00:08:15,834 --> 00:08:17,700
grown-up kids.

252
00:08:17,800 --> 00:08:20,434
They are not as mature as you think they are.

253
00:08:21,600 --> 00:08:22,834
I'm having a breakdown.

254
00:08:22,934 --> 00:08:24,567
Seriously, I feel like

255
00:08:24,667 --> 00:08:25,467
well, I've been working so hard

256
00:08:25,567 --> 00:08:27,700
but I couldn't show them

257
00:08:27,800 --> 00:08:30,367
my proudest achievement.

258
00:08:31,067 --> 00:08:31,567
Perhaps this show

259
00:08:31,667 --> 00:08:34,367
would be the first threshold to that goal.

260
00:08:34,700 --> 00:08:35,867
Yeah.

261
00:08:37,034 --> 00:08:37,934
It took more time for him

262
00:08:38,034 --> 00:08:40,300
to recover from the topic earlier.

263
00:08:40,400 --> 00:08:42,134
Yeah, actually for some while

264
00:08:42,667 --> 00:08:45,334
he's been processing it.

265
00:08:45,434 --> 00:08:47,034
We've all noticed that

266
00:08:47,134 --> 00:08:48,200
everyone is being really sweet.

267
00:08:48,300 --> 00:08:50,167
We don't interrupt him.

268
00:08:50,267 --> 00:08:51,300
We just kept talking and chatting

269
00:08:51,400 --> 00:08:52,434
and let him

270
00:08:52,534 --> 00:08:54,034
process his own feelings first.

271
00:08:54,134 --> 00:08:55,867
Yeah, I think, that's quite sweet.

272
00:08:55,967 --> 00:08:58,634
It kind of took me by surprise

273
00:08:58,734 --> 00:09:01,200
I'm dating a boyfriend from mainland.

274
00:09:01,300 --> 00:09:03,500
A week ago, when I was visiting mainland

275
00:09:03,600 --> 00:09:04,834
and moving in with him

276
00:09:04,934 --> 00:09:08,034
I told my mom I was leaving Taiwan, China.

277
00:09:08,467 --> 00:09:09,667
And she asked me why.

278
00:09:09,767 --> 00:09:11,167
- Because.
- I'm flying towards love.

279
00:09:11,267 --> 00:09:12,834
Yeah, my boyfriend is over there.

280
00:09:12,934 --> 00:09:14,434
So I just got up and left.

281
00:09:14,667 --> 00:09:17,334
Later, slowly she got to know more

282
00:09:17,434 --> 00:09:18,267
about my life.

283
00:09:18,367 --> 00:09:20,700
She gave me lots of space and comfort.

284
00:09:20,800 --> 00:09:21,834
(Jia-Hang's mom gave him lots of space)
She also read my book

285
00:09:21,934 --> 00:09:24,034
and she was there at my exhibition.

286
00:09:24,134 --> 00:09:24,767
So I feel like

287
00:09:24,867 --> 00:09:27,934
I'm lucky to have my family.

288
00:09:28,667 --> 00:09:29,667
I only came out to my mother

289
00:09:29,767 --> 00:09:31,667
and I was raised by my grandparents.

290
00:09:31,767 --> 00:09:35,700
When I brought someone home

291
00:09:35,800 --> 00:09:38,234
and did something with them.

292
00:09:38,334 --> 00:09:39,534
My parents came back.

293
00:09:41,867 --> 00:09:43,900
I like the sound of it.

294
00:09:44,800 --> 00:09:45,767
After seeing my guy off

295
00:09:45,867 --> 00:09:47,767
my mom got super upset.

296
00:09:47,867 --> 00:09:48,800
She called me to the living room.

297
00:09:48,900 --> 00:09:52,900
She just kept crying
and said that she was upset.

298
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:53,900
She cried not because

299
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:55,500
the fact that I'm into boys.

300
00:09:55,600 --> 00:09:58,200
(His mom was upset about not knowing for who he was)
but because she thought she didn't know me.

301
00:09:58,300 --> 00:09:59,900
Yeah, she told me

302
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:02,067
that after taking care of us
for such a long time

303
00:10:02,167 --> 00:10:03,867
she still had zero idea

304
00:10:03,967 --> 00:10:06,067
about something this important.

305
00:10:06,167 --> 00:10:07,867
Yeah, this is how I think about this

306
00:10:07,967 --> 00:10:10,067
I bet it must be really hard for you guys

307
00:10:10,167 --> 00:10:12,534
but whether you guys have come out or not

308
00:10:12,634 --> 00:10:13,767
letting everyone know

309
00:10:13,867 --> 00:10:15,667
it'd be really if family is there for you.

310
00:10:15,767 --> 00:10:16,767
If they aren't supportive

311
00:10:16,867 --> 00:10:19,734
you still gotta live a good life.

312
00:10:19,834 --> 00:10:23,167
Yeah, it is relatively important.

313
00:10:23,267 --> 00:10:25,100
(Abao encouraged everyone to treat yourself better no matter what)
To treat yourself better.

314
00:10:25,200 --> 00:10:26,300
Because when you're doing better

315
00:10:26,400 --> 00:10:28,267
I do believe that your family will realize

316
00:10:28,367 --> 00:10:29,134
that different sexuality

317
00:10:29,234 --> 00:10:30,834
and non-mainstream sexuality

318
00:10:30,934 --> 00:10:33,534
pose no difference to any kid.

319
00:10:33,634 --> 00:10:35,500
This is what matters the most.

320
00:10:41,367 --> 00:10:42,734
It is quite obvious

321
00:10:42,834 --> 00:10:43,934
that after talking to them

322
00:10:44,034 --> 00:10:47,167
I'd know it is hard for the minority

323
00:10:47,267 --> 00:10:49,200
to be in love.

324
00:10:49,300 --> 00:10:50,200
Yeah, I sincerely hope

325
00:10:50,300 --> 00:10:52,367
that everyone can slowly

326
00:10:52,467 --> 00:10:55,600
get to accept them
understand and interact with them.

327
00:10:55,700 --> 00:10:57,500
And to know how they think.

328
00:10:58,567 --> 00:11:00,567
Do you have something in your mind?

329
00:11:00,667 --> 00:11:02,034
(Abao noticed Jia-Hang's ardent eyes)
Me? Can I share?

330
00:11:02,134 --> 00:11:02,967
Absolutely.

331
00:11:03,700 --> 00:11:05,234
You play a huge role in my life as my mentor.

332
00:11:05,334 --> 00:11:08,800
In terms of recognizing my own identity.

333
00:11:08,900 --> 00:11:10,867
When I'm taking pictures
I feel like

334
00:11:10,967 --> 00:11:12,234
since I'm gay.

335
00:11:12,334 --> 00:11:14,667
(Jia-Hang raises his question to Abao)
I take pictures through the lens of a gay man.

336
00:11:14,767 --> 00:11:17,034
However, after filming a bunch of stuff

337
00:11:17,134 --> 00:11:18,234
I'd doubt myself

338
00:11:18,334 --> 00:11:21,700
whether I'm stuck in the box.

339
00:11:21,800 --> 00:11:25,767
As if I'll never take pictures other than these.

340
00:11:25,934 --> 00:11:26,934
People have this habit

341
00:11:27,034 --> 00:11:28,800
of connecting me to aboriginals.

342
00:11:28,900 --> 00:11:29,800
They assume everything I do

343
00:11:29,900 --> 00:11:31,100
is supposed to be about aboriginals.

344
00:11:31,200 --> 00:11:34,034
But sometimes, it is totally fine

345
00:11:34,134 --> 00:11:36,634
if you want to get out of your comfort zone.

346
00:11:36,734 --> 00:11:37,667
Personally

347
00:11:37,767 --> 00:11:40,467
what I want to make is music
no matter what

348
00:11:40,567 --> 00:11:42,434
(not being limited by your identity)
as long as I'm making music

349
00:11:42,534 --> 00:11:44,400
(as long as you know yourself, you are a unique creation...)
what I'm wearing now, sitting right here

350
00:11:44,500 --> 00:11:46,000
without wearing or bringing
any of my tribe outfits.

351
00:11:46,100 --> 00:11:48,767
But you guys know perfectly
what my identity is.

352
00:11:48,867 --> 00:11:50,867
So I don't have to make an effort

353
00:11:50,967 --> 00:11:52,200
to tell you who I am.

354
00:11:52,300 --> 00:11:54,467
Whatever you do will represent who you are.

355
00:11:54,567 --> 00:11:56,434
Whether you want to
take photos of boys or girls

356
00:11:56,534 --> 00:11:58,067
even animals, anything.

357
00:11:58,167 --> 00:11:59,367
Whether they are photos of old people, kids.

358
00:11:59,467 --> 00:12:01,834
They are all coming from the same gay person.

359
00:12:01,934 --> 00:12:03,700
These works are created by you.

360
00:12:03,800 --> 00:12:04,800
So you don't have to...

361
00:12:04,900 --> 00:12:06,634
Gosh, you're crying?

362
00:12:06,734 --> 00:12:07,700
Hold on.

363
00:12:07,800 --> 00:12:09,234
So you don't have to worry about.

364
00:12:09,334 --> 00:12:10,934
(What Abao shared has touched Jia-Hang deeply...)
whether it is enough or not

365
00:12:11,034 --> 00:12:13,367
in terms of creating a work as a gay identity

366
00:12:13,534 --> 00:12:14,367
I adore Abao very much.

367
00:12:14,467 --> 00:12:16,867
She plays a huge role

368
00:12:16,967 --> 00:12:20,034
in terms of being my inspiration.

369
00:12:20,134 --> 00:12:22,367
She does not shy away

370
00:12:22,467 --> 00:12:24,800
from showing her own identity

371
00:12:24,900 --> 00:12:27,767
I hope I get
to be someone like her someday.

372
00:12:28,400 --> 00:12:30,534
Isn't that something people...

373
00:12:30,634 --> 00:12:31,600
People would

374
00:12:31,700 --> 00:12:33,900
instantly know how many likes you get.

375
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:36,334
(The reviews on social media trouble Jia-Hang...)
to determine whether you're liked by the public or not.

376
00:12:36,434 --> 00:12:37,767
Not really, no.

377
00:12:37,867 --> 00:12:39,334
Let me tell you something.

378
00:12:39,434 --> 00:12:40,834
It is highly possible

379
00:12:40,934 --> 00:12:41,700
that there is a buyer

380
00:12:41,800 --> 00:12:43,100
who has the money to buy your work

381
00:12:43,200 --> 00:12:44,334
but they're not someone

382
00:12:44,434 --> 00:12:45,634
who use Instagram.

383
00:12:45,734 --> 00:12:46,600
That person wouldn't hit the like button.

384
00:12:46,700 --> 00:12:47,934
But they would open their wallet
to buy your stuff.

385
00:12:48,034 --> 00:12:49,334
Which one do you want?

386
00:12:49,700 --> 00:12:52,634
Then I'm dating that buyer.

387
00:12:57,400 --> 00:12:58,834
Actually, after the dinner tonight

388
00:12:58,934 --> 00:13:01,267
I've changed some of
my perspectives on Jia-Hang

389
00:13:01,367 --> 00:13:04,167
I adore his personality.

390
00:13:04,267 --> 00:13:06,134
It is quite great, honestly.

391
00:13:06,234 --> 00:13:07,234
He may be aware of his problems

392
00:13:07,334 --> 00:13:09,467
but he has no clue how to deal with that

393
00:13:09,567 --> 00:13:11,267
and he's trying to seek help

394
00:13:11,367 --> 00:13:16,167
(here comes a special dish)(smoke)

395
00:13:16,267 --> 00:13:16,667
Looks fancy.

396
00:13:16,767 --> 00:13:18,400
It really does.

397
00:13:18,500 --> 00:13:20,200
- Awesome.
- It gives you a soothing effect.

398
00:13:20,300 --> 00:13:21,400
Have you guys felt that?

399
00:13:21,500 --> 00:13:22,867
I bet only Jia-Hang

400
00:13:22,967 --> 00:13:24,534
and Gino have...

401
00:13:25,034 --> 00:13:27,300
- It smells incredibly nice.
- Look at Jia-Hang and Gino.

402
00:13:27,400 --> 00:13:29,534
They both will have the best sleep tonight.

403
00:13:30,367 --> 00:13:31,167
Alright, I'm gonna ask you something.

404
00:13:31,267 --> 00:13:32,800
Now I want you all to close your eyes.

405
00:13:32,900 --> 00:13:33,834
(Abao suddenly wants everyone with their eyes closed
Don't open them.

406
00:13:33,934 --> 00:13:35,834
Is there something cooking...)
For the time being, if any of you

407
00:13:35,934 --> 00:13:37,200
have feelings for one another.

408
00:13:37,300 --> 00:13:40,400
Please raise your hand.

409
00:13:41,734 --> 00:13:43,434
Well, since you've been hanging out
with each other for days

410
00:13:43,534 --> 00:13:45,400
I bet everyone has an answer.

411
00:13:45,500 --> 00:13:47,667
(Everyone raised hands except Jia-Hang, Guan-Yu, and Susu)
At least a little bit, I guess.

412
00:13:47,767 --> 00:13:50,334
Originally, what I expected to see

413
00:13:50,434 --> 00:13:51,934
was one or two people
raising their hands at the top.

414
00:13:52,034 --> 00:13:53,434
It turned out quite a lot.

415
00:13:53,534 --> 00:13:54,534
Then I felt like.

416
00:13:54,634 --> 00:13:57,134
Oh, this could go somewhere.

417
00:13:57,600 --> 00:13:59,834
If you have a crush already

418
00:13:59,934 --> 00:14:01,700
please raise your hand.

419
00:14:01,800 --> 00:14:04,334
And point out a rough direction

420
00:14:04,434 --> 00:14:07,567
of where he is.

421
00:14:07,667 --> 00:14:08,900
Peeking is not allowed.

422
00:14:09,834 --> 00:14:10,767
Peeking is not allowed.

423
00:14:10,867 --> 00:14:13,667
Hold on, we're still waiting for one person.

424
00:14:15,434 --> 00:14:18,134
(Where does everyone heart belong?)

425
00:14:18,234 --> 00:14:20,900
Okay, now put your hand down.

426
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:22,267
Open your eyes

427
00:14:24,034 --> 00:14:25,000
(naughty)
Awesome.

428
00:14:25,100 --> 00:14:26,700
You are so mean.

429
00:14:27,034 --> 00:14:28,367
Drop that sales talk.

430
00:14:28,467 --> 00:14:29,900
Are you here to make friends?

431
00:14:31,300 --> 00:14:32,267
Let me ask you something

432
00:14:32,367 --> 00:14:34,867
(waving)
Do you have friends murmuring about

433
00:14:34,967 --> 00:14:36,234
how they want to get married...

434
00:14:36,334 --> 00:14:38,200
(attack)
but they end up being afraid of marriages.

435
00:14:38,600 --> 00:14:42,167
Oh my god

436
00:14:42,267 --> 00:14:44,667
(screaming)
This is horrifying.

437
00:14:44,767 --> 00:14:46,134
We are out in the woods.

438
00:14:46,234 --> 00:14:46,734
That one just hit my forehead.

439
00:14:46,834 --> 00:14:48,367
(On this summer night, insects are also the guests to this event...)
and it just came right back.

440
00:14:48,767 --> 00:14:50,067
- What on earth.
- What is that?

441
00:14:50,167 --> 00:14:51,200
Moth.

442
00:14:51,534 --> 00:14:52,667
- How's the food?
- Do you want napkins?

443
00:14:52,767 --> 00:14:54,600
What food? He didn't eat that.

444
00:14:54,700 --> 00:14:55,167
Thanks.

445
00:14:55,267 --> 00:14:56,334
Do you need tissues?

446
00:14:56,434 --> 00:14:57,134
I have them over here

447
00:14:57,234 --> 00:14:58,734
I have to repeat this clip one hundred times

448
00:14:58,834 --> 00:15:00,467
so be sure to send the clip to me.

449
00:15:01,267 --> 00:15:03,434
- Go viral...
- Awesome, you're gonna be rich.

450
00:15:03,534 --> 00:15:04,634
(Thank you, insects, for the surprise you bring...)
Aren't you making an album now?

451
00:15:04,734 --> 00:15:06,067
Now I'm maintaining a friendship
with you from now on

452
00:15:06,167 --> 00:15:07,900
I'd appreciate it...

453
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:09,634
YAˇK

454
00:15:09,734 --> 00:15:12,367
(Cheers again to this wonderful night)
Cheers.

455
00:15:13,067 --> 00:15:14,234
The best day.

456
00:15:14,334 --> 00:15:15,800
The show just keeps getting better

457
00:15:15,900 --> 00:15:18,434
I feel like, it is rare in Taiwan, China

458
00:15:18,534 --> 00:15:19,934
to have a reality show

459
00:15:20,034 --> 00:15:22,134
about boys relationship

460
00:15:22,234 --> 00:15:24,600
I mean, personally, there are many.

461
00:15:24,700 --> 00:15:26,967
LGBTQ+ community friends around me.

462
00:15:27,067 --> 00:15:28,567
And I bet talking to them

463
00:15:28,667 --> 00:15:30,867
can offer different perspectives
for the viewers

464
00:15:30,967 --> 00:15:32,234
from different angles.

465
00:15:32,334 --> 00:15:34,134
To get a better understanding
of their thoughts.

466
00:15:34,234 --> 00:15:36,334
Gosh, what a great day

467
00:15:36,434 --> 00:15:37,534
I'm not showering today.

468
00:15:37,634 --> 00:15:39,300
How nice it is to get together like this.

469
00:15:39,400 --> 00:15:40,934
(Picture time with members and Abao)
It is freaking amazing.

470
00:15:41,034 --> 00:15:42,400
She is a fun and interesting sister.

471
00:15:42,500 --> 00:15:43,700
Well, it's like

472
00:15:43,800 --> 00:15:45,767
she is totally down to talk about stuff

473
00:15:45,867 --> 00:15:47,367
that is more serious.

474
00:15:47,467 --> 00:15:49,700
After addressing those topics

475
00:15:49,800 --> 00:15:50,834
she could go back

476
00:15:50,934 --> 00:15:52,300
to the person who's light and fun.

477
00:15:52,400 --> 00:15:55,500
She can make jokes, and she can play.

478
00:15:55,600 --> 00:16:00,100
That's exactly the inclusivity
that we desperately need.

479
00:16:00,200 --> 00:16:01,734
Kind-hearted people.

480
00:16:01,834 --> 00:16:04,967
So that we could have the power

481
00:16:05,067 --> 00:16:07,800
to make the world a better place.

482
00:16:07,900 --> 00:16:08,667
(Sitting on the merry-go-round
in the Lavender Forest)

483
00:16:08,767 --> 00:16:11,434
(Let's be romantic till the end of the night!)
Wow, I'm so nervous.

484
00:16:11,534 --> 00:16:12,800
It is scary.

485
00:16:12,900 --> 00:16:13,834
It's about to start.

486
00:16:13,934 --> 00:16:15,234
Oh...

487
00:16:16,034 --> 00:16:17,300
My god, this is love.

488
00:16:17,400 --> 00:16:19,067
How pretty it is.

489
00:16:25,400 --> 00:16:27,634
Woah, this is my first time riding this.

490
00:16:27,734 --> 00:16:31,034
It's been ten years since I did this.

491
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:43,534
(It's time to say goodbye to our special guest)
Bye...

492
00:16:43,634 --> 00:16:46,600
Good thing that we live
in this Internet world

493
00:16:46,700 --> 00:16:48,267
I won't see you off then.

494
00:16:49,200 --> 00:16:51,400
Bye...

495
00:16:51,634 --> 00:16:52,634
Where am I going?

496
00:16:52,734 --> 00:16:53,800
See you next time.

497
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:54,700
Did you think...

498
00:16:54,800 --> 00:16:55,867
I'll come visit you again.

499
00:16:56,267 --> 00:16:57,500
Well, no problem.

500
00:16:57,667 --> 00:16:59,567
Welcome to attack my village again.

501
00:16:59,767 --> 00:17:01,134
Yes, absolutely.

502
00:17:06,667 --> 00:17:10,567
(Double Room/Susu, Jia-Hang)

503
00:17:16,834 --> 00:17:18,534
If you already have a crush right now

504
00:17:18,634 --> 00:17:21,734
(earlier)
Please raise your hand, come on.

505
00:17:22,300 --> 00:17:24,334
(Jia-Hang didn't raise his hand...)

506
00:17:24,434 --> 00:17:26,500
The truth is, I'm not gonna choose anymore

507
00:17:26,767 --> 00:17:27,500
I think during this journey

508
00:17:27,600 --> 00:17:29,767
it is just a great time
to meet every one of them

509
00:17:29,867 --> 00:17:33,334
and to create beautiful memories.

510
00:17:33,500 --> 00:17:36,434
(Double Room/Eri, Bobo)

511
00:17:36,534 --> 00:17:38,200
I'm here to take a peek.

512
00:17:38,300 --> 00:17:39,367
Please do.

513
00:17:39,467 --> 00:17:41,600
(Susu visited Bobo for a room tour)

514
00:17:41,700 --> 00:17:43,034
How's your waist?

515
00:17:43,134 --> 00:17:44,300
It still hurts.

516
00:17:44,400 --> 00:17:46,234
How about taking a seat
and getting some rest?

517
00:17:46,334 --> 00:17:48,767
I might not be able to get up after that.

518
00:17:49,700 --> 00:17:51,900
- Given my current situation.
- That sounds serious.

519
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:54,434
You go take a rest.

520
00:17:54,534 --> 00:17:56,067
Not that I want to, but it feels good

521
00:17:56,167 --> 00:17:57,334
I really don't want to see you suffer

522
00:17:57,434 --> 00:17:59,200
I just feel like bullying you.

523
00:17:59,967 --> 00:18:01,667
Yes, I didn't raise my hand.

524
00:18:02,267 --> 00:18:04,100
Based on how things go currently

525
00:18:04,200 --> 00:18:06,100
I might need some more time

526
00:18:06,200 --> 00:18:07,100
to get to know them.

527
00:18:07,200 --> 00:18:09,667
Like, whether the flow of
our conversations match

528
00:18:09,767 --> 00:18:11,400
and whether we stand a chance

529
00:18:11,500 --> 00:18:13,434
to move into something more.

530
00:18:13,534 --> 00:18:17,167
(Quadruple Room/NIO, Guan-Yu, Gino, Shih-Feng)

531
00:18:18,034 --> 00:18:19,367
Depressing.

532
00:18:19,667 --> 00:18:21,567
(NIO and Shih-Feng are packing for their new room)
Why? Because we're splitting the room?

533
00:18:21,667 --> 00:18:22,734
Yeah.

534
00:18:26,934 --> 00:18:30,300
(Gino and Guan-Yu outside the bedroom)
What? Are you drunk?

535
00:18:30,600 --> 00:18:31,434
Are you alright?

536
00:18:33,034 --> 00:18:35,334
What is this? Why are you hugging me?

537
00:18:35,434 --> 00:18:36,634
(Guan-Yu gave Gino a huge hug...)
I think he has calmed down a little

538
00:18:36,734 --> 00:18:38,700
but it seems to me

539
00:18:38,800 --> 00:18:39,567
that his emotions
are still going up and down.

540
00:18:39,667 --> 00:18:40,934
Plus, he'd sigh or something.

541
00:18:41,034 --> 00:18:43,034
So I gave him a huge hug

542
00:18:44,234 --> 00:18:46,334
(earlier)
If you have a crush here

543
00:18:46,434 --> 00:18:49,900
raise your hand and point in the direction.

544
00:18:50,800 --> 00:18:53,367
I pointed at Guan-Yu.

545
00:18:53,467 --> 00:18:54,467
(Question/Whom did you think Guan-Yu pointed to?)
I have no clue

546
00:18:54,567 --> 00:18:56,034
I'd like to guess but I'm scared

547
00:18:56,134 --> 00:18:57,034
I don't feel like guessing.

548
00:19:00,634 --> 00:19:02,567
Because I feel like.

549
00:19:03,100 --> 00:19:05,934
(Question/Why didn't you raise your hand?)
a lot of them are so friendly to me.

550
00:19:06,034 --> 00:19:07,500
In that situation, it somehow confuses me

551
00:19:07,600 --> 00:19:09,300
and I don't know what's the best response.

552
00:19:09,400 --> 00:19:10,700
Therefore, I'd like a moment to chill myself

553
00:19:10,800 --> 00:19:12,100
to observe everyone.

554
00:19:12,200 --> 00:19:13,167
That's how I would know

555
00:19:13,267 --> 00:19:14,667
whom exactly I'm interested in.

556
00:19:15,334 --> 00:19:17,367
(Quadruple Room/Eri, Bobo)
So did you raise your hand earlier?

557
00:19:17,467 --> 00:19:19,000
I did raise my hand, and I pointed at him.

558
00:19:19,100 --> 00:19:21,400
Actually, I did point a direction, too

559
00:19:21,500 --> 00:19:23,434
but I bet he didn't raise his hand.

560
00:19:23,934 --> 00:19:25,000
My guess is that from the beginning.

561
00:19:25,100 --> 00:19:27,800
(Eri guessed NIO didn't raise his hand
but NIO did point at somewhere..) he didn't raise his hand.

562
00:19:29,334 --> 00:19:32,700
You know, it takes longer
for me to fall for someone.

563
00:19:32,800 --> 00:19:35,800
Yeah, it won't be quick

564
00:19:35,900 --> 00:19:37,634
I did point a direction.

565
00:19:37,734 --> 00:19:38,867
Because she mentioned a "direction".

566
00:19:38,967 --> 00:19:41,134
Maintaining a friendly relationship with NIO.

567
00:19:41,234 --> 00:19:42,134
We talk about music

568
00:19:42,234 --> 00:19:44,167
and we could always have a good laugh.

569
00:19:44,267 --> 00:19:44,900
It is wonderful.

570
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:47,467
Besides, if I'm being honest

571
00:19:47,567 --> 00:19:49,700
I have strong feelings toward him.

572
00:19:50,300 --> 00:19:51,767
But, yeah.

573
00:19:51,867 --> 00:19:53,167
So?

574
00:19:53,267 --> 00:19:55,400
I feel like I'm literally

575
00:19:55,500 --> 00:19:57,500
a matchmaker.

576
00:19:58,600 --> 00:20:00,000
It didn't work out, though

577
00:20:00,100 --> 00:20:02,234
I'll say this, this matchmaker thing
didn't work out.

578
00:20:02,334 --> 00:20:04,100
Well, fine, but at least I tried.

579
00:20:04,200 --> 00:20:06,000
- This wasn't my first time.
- But I had a great time already

580
00:20:06,100 --> 00:20:07,434
I'm already delighted.

581
00:20:07,567 --> 00:20:08,634
Well, I tried really hard

582
00:20:08,734 --> 00:20:10,000
I'm literally gonna cry now.

583
00:20:10,100 --> 00:20:11,467
At the end, they were moving down the lane

584
00:20:11,567 --> 00:20:12,767
I even grabbed Eri's lamp

585
00:20:12,867 --> 00:20:14,600
and told him to go with him.

586
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:16,367
(Earlier on the way to merry-go-round)

587
00:20:16,467 --> 00:20:19,300
Such a perfect place for falling in love.

588
00:20:19,400 --> 00:20:19,867
(With the help of Bobo
Eri and NIO finally end up together)

589
00:20:20,200 --> 00:20:22,800
My face, my face looks dumb.

590
00:20:23,634 --> 00:20:26,400
You being with him, at that moment, finally.

591
00:20:27,967 --> 00:20:31,567
NIO looked genuinely awkward earlier.

592
00:20:31,667 --> 00:20:32,200
He did?

593
00:20:32,300 --> 00:20:33,800
A little, yes.

594
00:20:33,900 --> 00:20:35,400
He actually asked me.

595
00:20:35,500 --> 00:20:37,600
Because I asked him earlier

596
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:40,300
whether he wanted to be with someone then.

597
00:20:40,767 --> 00:20:42,900
I... I'm alright.

598
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:44,434
Okay.

599
00:20:48,200 --> 00:20:49,634
What about you?

600
00:20:51,234 --> 00:20:53,400
(staring)

601
00:20:54,467 --> 00:20:55,834
You're the one.

602
00:20:55,934 --> 00:20:56,934
- Seriously?
- Yeah.

603
00:20:57,034 --> 00:20:59,700
- Then I'm happy to be here with you.
- As long as you're happy.

604
00:21:00,700 --> 00:21:03,934
(The thing between them
is it the flirtation... or the awkwardness?)

605
00:21:04,700 --> 00:21:06,334
What about you?

606
00:21:06,434 --> 00:21:08,734
- I didn't have a good time earlier.
- Why's that?

607
00:21:08,834 --> 00:21:11,734
No one was next to me on the horses.

608
00:21:11,834 --> 00:21:13,400
Then why didn't go sit next to him?

609
00:21:13,500 --> 00:21:16,300
Because he went to sit next to Guan-Yu.

610
00:21:16,400 --> 00:21:18,967
(It was an empty seat next to Bobo...)

611
00:21:21,067 --> 00:21:22,167
Alright, then I'll sleep with you.

612
00:21:22,267 --> 00:21:23,434
It's alright.

613
00:21:23,534 --> 00:21:26,300
Go back, go back.

614
00:21:26,400 --> 00:21:28,500
Poor you, it's fine.

615
00:21:28,600 --> 00:21:30,067
It'll be soon.

616
00:21:30,834 --> 00:21:31,934
We've known each other
only for a couple of days.

617
00:21:32,034 --> 00:21:33,967
It's not worth being this upset.

618
00:21:34,067 --> 00:21:35,067
You've got a point.

619
00:21:35,167 --> 00:21:36,634
That's my opinion.

620
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:38,500
(People in the room
are also discussing what happened earlier)

621
00:21:38,600 --> 00:21:40,900
But it was obvious that Eri came to talk to me

622
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:42,200
and said he liked me.

623
00:21:42,300 --> 00:21:43,834
- Yeah, I guess so.
- Because Bobo.

624
00:21:43,934 --> 00:21:46,067
He was being nice, but given the situation

625
00:21:46,167 --> 00:21:48,000
I was the reason for that awkwardness.

626
00:21:48,534 --> 00:21:51,000
I didn't know how to react at that moment

627
00:21:51,100 --> 00:21:52,400
I didn't say much, though

628
00:21:52,500 --> 00:21:53,934
I agreed that we walked together.

629
00:21:54,034 --> 00:21:55,000
(NIO seems awkward around Eri...)
The most awkward thing is that

630
00:21:55,100 --> 00:21:56,134
after a few minutes.

631
00:21:56,234 --> 00:21:58,034
Eri told me it was totally fine

632
00:21:58,134 --> 00:21:59,334
if I didn't walk with him.

633
00:21:59,434 --> 00:22:01,934
And I wondered the meaning
behind that sentence

634
00:22:04,434 --> 00:22:05,034
(it came to him suddenly)

635
00:22:05,367 --> 00:22:09,100
(he suddenly explains the reason for choosing Guan-Yu)
Sorry, the fact that I chose Gun-Yu as my roommate.

636
00:22:09,200 --> 00:22:10,367
It doesn't mean anything

637
00:22:10,467 --> 00:22:12,134
like...

638
00:22:12,234 --> 00:22:14,567
Yeah, I noticed it
when you were talking to Jia-Hang

639
00:22:14,667 --> 00:22:15,267
explaining to him

640
00:22:15,367 --> 00:22:17,967
you seemed to mention something.

641
00:22:18,067 --> 00:22:18,867
What did I say to Jia-Hang?

642
00:22:18,967 --> 00:22:20,700
Well, you explained

643
00:22:20,800 --> 00:22:22,767
that why you chose Guan-Yu as your roommate.

644
00:22:22,867 --> 00:22:23,234
Okay

645
00:22:23,334 --> 00:22:24,767
I guess that's another explanation for it.

646
00:22:24,867 --> 00:22:28,500
(Why did NIO suddenly mention his choice about roommates...)

647
00:22:32,800 --> 00:22:35,767
I'm not sure if I like him for real or not

648
00:22:35,867 --> 00:22:39,400
I'll put it like this
not that nothing is there.

649
00:22:39,500 --> 00:22:40,667
Yeah, If nothing exists

650
00:22:40,767 --> 00:22:41,634
I wouldn't raise my hand.

651
00:22:41,734 --> 00:22:43,100
However, later I was wondering

652
00:22:43,200 --> 00:22:45,267
and asking myself if there is something at all.

653
00:22:45,367 --> 00:22:46,767
Is it really nothing?

654
00:22:46,867 --> 00:22:48,567
Nothing.

655
00:22:48,667 --> 00:22:50,034
So it's something.

656
00:22:50,134 --> 00:22:53,000
Which way you'll be pointing?

657
00:22:53,267 --> 00:22:54,834
(NIO was pointed at...?)
Peeking is not allowed.

658
00:23:02,467 --> 00:23:06,267
I mean, it's pretty obvious, come on.

659
00:23:07,534 --> 00:23:08,767
It's Guan-Yu.

660
00:23:08,867 --> 00:23:13,267
Yeah, it is my roommate.

661
00:23:14,134 --> 00:23:17,534
Sorry, Guan-Yu
You have to keep being my roommate again.

662
00:23:19,334 --> 00:23:20,534
Why would you choose Guan-Yu again?

663
00:23:20,634 --> 00:23:22,267
I'm used to it.

664
00:23:22,367 --> 00:23:24,034
(NIO says away from the topic every time...)
I'm someone who recognizes my own bed

665
00:23:24,134 --> 00:23:26,600
and my own roommate.

666
00:23:27,134 --> 00:23:29,334
I think that's where I'm good at.

667
00:23:30,934 --> 00:23:33,567
Because no one seems to notice anything.

668
00:23:33,667 --> 00:23:34,434
Yeah

669
00:23:34,534 --> 00:23:36,234
I mean, it's great to change a pattern.

670
00:23:36,334 --> 00:23:37,967
Besides, there isn't anyone

671
00:23:38,067 --> 00:23:42,400
whom I'd like to choose, anyway.

672
00:23:42,500 --> 00:23:44,134
Someone to share a room with.

673
00:23:45,934 --> 00:23:49,834
(Would there be any sparkle now
both of them are roommates...?)

674
00:24:02,300 --> 00:24:04,667
We are moving now.

675
00:24:06,934 --> 00:24:08,734
I miss the time
when the four of us are together.

676
00:24:08,834 --> 00:24:10,134
You know, we live next door.

677
00:24:10,234 --> 00:24:12,234
We can just open the door.

678
00:24:12,334 --> 00:24:13,534
Gino, you look cute.

679
00:24:13,634 --> 00:24:14,734
Your reaction.

680
00:24:14,834 --> 00:24:16,900
(Four of them move into the double rooms)

681
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:18,000
I almost trip.

682
00:24:18,100 --> 00:24:21,000
Welcome.

683
00:24:21,100 --> 00:24:22,134
Sorry to bother.

684
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:24,767
Do you need any help?

685
00:24:24,867 --> 00:24:26,367
I'm pretending to offer my help.

686
00:24:26,467 --> 00:24:28,800
No problem, I do receive your love.

687
00:24:28,900 --> 00:24:33,100
(Double Room/Shih-Feng, Gino)

688
00:24:33,200 --> 00:24:35,234
- Hi.
- Gino

689
00:24:35,334 --> 00:24:36,634
I can let you choose first

690
00:24:36,734 --> 00:24:37,967
- go ahead.
- It was my pick last time.

691
00:24:38,067 --> 00:24:38,834
It doesn't matter.

692
00:24:38,934 --> 00:24:40,867
- Then this one is mine.
- Sure.

693
00:24:40,967 --> 00:24:42,534
Thanks.

694
00:24:42,700 --> 00:24:45,267
(Double Room/Guan-Yu, NIO)
Wow, we can see the light outside.

695
00:24:46,800 --> 00:24:48,267
- It's great.
- Not bad.

696
00:24:48,367 --> 00:24:50,434
- Seriously not bad.
- Really nice.

697
00:24:50,534 --> 00:24:51,900
We have a closet over here

698
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:54,200
because we only have two people now.

699
00:24:54,567 --> 00:24:55,400
And there's a full-length mirror.

700
00:24:55,500 --> 00:24:56,767
Gosh, yes.

701
00:24:57,534 --> 00:25:00,300
- This room is smaller.
- Yeah, it is.

702
00:25:01,600 --> 00:25:03,600
- Let's take a look at another room.
- Why's that? Yours are awesome.

703
00:25:03,700 --> 00:25:04,334
What do you mean?

704
00:25:04,434 --> 00:25:06,534
We have this night view.

705
00:25:10,700 --> 00:25:12,334
They have light pollution.

706
00:25:13,400 --> 00:25:14,834
(This night isn't over yet...)
It's quite romantic here.

707
00:25:17,267 --> 00:25:19,300
Is it gonna be something special?

708
00:25:19,500 --> 00:25:20,167
(Everyone received an instruction)
Here it is.

709
00:25:20,267 --> 00:25:21,567
Is it here yet?

710
00:25:22,067 --> 00:25:24,700
Please open the envelop.

711
00:25:24,800 --> 00:25:26,500
(During the interview earlier, everyone received an envelop)
- Woah - I'm gonna read it.

712
00:25:33,667 --> 00:25:35,034
Gosh, every day, man...

713
00:25:35,134 --> 00:25:37,267
It is stressful.

714
00:25:37,367 --> 00:25:39,067
(Please open the envelop now)
- Let's open it together - Just open it.

715
00:25:39,167 --> 00:25:39,900
Can I take it out?

716
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:41,100
Just read it.

717
00:25:41,200 --> 00:25:42,200
Read it already.

718
00:25:43,867 --> 00:25:45,300
That's fine, you can read it.

719
00:25:45,400 --> 00:25:46,300
Oh my god.

720
00:25:47,367 --> 00:25:49,267
- What does it mean?
- Did everyone get the same one?

721
00:25:49,367 --> 00:25:50,300
(What is it that shocked everyone?)

722
00:25:50,400 --> 00:25:51,634
Okay.

723
00:25:51,734 --> 00:25:53,400
This came not as a surprise.

724
00:25:53,500 --> 00:25:55,467
Woah, okay.

725
00:25:55,567 --> 00:25:56,134
My chest is tight.

726
00:25:56,234 --> 00:25:58,234
Well, I'm already content as it is.

727
00:25:59,600 --> 00:26:01,700
Everyone thinks they are the one leaving

728
00:26:01,800 --> 00:26:02,734
I don't know.

729
00:26:02,834 --> 00:26:05,067
Tomorrow noon and morning.

730
00:26:05,167 --> 00:26:07,267
(Rule/From the Future Preview)(Someone will be leaving tomorrow night.
Someone will be leaving tomorrow night.

731
00:26:07,291 --> 00:26:09,491
Please seize the chance to date tomorrow noon)
Please seize the chance to date tomorrow noon.

732
00:26:11,067 --> 00:26:12,467
It did cross my mind.

733
00:26:12,567 --> 00:26:13,834
Seriously?

734
00:26:13,934 --> 00:26:16,300
I just spoke three sentences with you today.

735
00:26:17,234 --> 00:26:19,000
Thank you guys, we'll just...

736
00:26:19,100 --> 00:26:20,334
How are they gonna decide which one of us leave?

737
00:26:20,434 --> 00:26:23,400
This is giving me the edginess of Werewolf.

738
00:26:23,500 --> 00:26:24,934
So, now.

739
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:27,734
We just ate together.

740
00:26:27,834 --> 00:26:29,167
Yeah.

741
00:26:29,267 --> 00:26:30,267
Let's call it a day.

742
00:26:30,367 --> 00:26:31,300
So what now?

743
00:26:31,400 --> 00:26:32,800
Like we can just leave.

744
00:26:32,900 --> 00:26:35,000
(They call it a day, with uneasiness and complicated feelings...)
I bet it's not me, since I'm the host here.

745
00:26:43,700 --> 00:26:45,034
(Double Room/Eri, Bobo)
Did you collect all of my

746
00:26:45,134 --> 00:26:46,100
showering stuff?

747
00:26:46,200 --> 00:26:47,534
I did.

748
00:26:47,634 --> 00:26:49,800
Because I packed up my suitcase.

749
00:26:49,900 --> 00:26:52,634
If I'm leaving tomorrow,
I can just get up and leave.

750
00:26:53,767 --> 00:26:54,334
You think it's

751
00:26:54,434 --> 00:26:57,000
I feel like it might be...

752
00:26:57,500 --> 00:27:00,200
If I'm guessing how this game works

753
00:27:00,300 --> 00:27:01,767
I think it might be

754
00:27:01,867 --> 00:27:03,467
someone who never gets one call

755
00:27:03,567 --> 00:27:05,967
or never gets picked.

756
00:27:06,067 --> 00:27:08,667
Shih-Feng might be a reasonable choice.

757
00:27:08,767 --> 00:27:10,800
Because I've talked to him before.

758
00:27:10,900 --> 00:27:13,000
He said he never received one call.

759
00:27:15,100 --> 00:27:16,167
If I'm ending this early

760
00:27:16,267 --> 00:27:18,200
it means I have to go back to work early.

761
00:27:18,300 --> 00:27:19,734
Right, I just realized I've got ramen

762
00:27:19,834 --> 00:27:20,634
I'm having ramen.

763
00:27:20,734 --> 00:27:22,567
Didn't you just say
you didn't want to eat anymore?

764
00:27:22,667 --> 00:27:26,500
You can just say you don't want to leave...

765
00:27:26,600 --> 00:27:27,500
It's a pity, honestly.

766
00:27:27,600 --> 00:27:30,034
Because I haven't spent
enough time with everyone.

767
00:27:30,134 --> 00:27:30,734
Besides, I keep

768
00:27:30,834 --> 00:27:33,100
I've never really had friends in the circle.

769
00:27:33,200 --> 00:27:35,067
Now we all have this bond together.

770
00:27:35,167 --> 00:27:36,800
It's like, Rainbow Apartment.

771
00:27:36,900 --> 00:27:39,867
Everyone gets out
and just fool around in the morning.

772
00:27:39,967 --> 00:27:41,334
However, some might just ask me

773
00:27:41,434 --> 00:27:43,467
how is my night going, yeah.

774
00:27:43,567 --> 00:27:45,667
This is the bond that

775
00:27:45,767 --> 00:27:46,800
I've never experienced before.

776
00:27:46,900 --> 00:27:47,834
So I feel like.

777
00:27:47,934 --> 00:27:49,367
Because I tend to get nostalgic.

778
00:27:49,467 --> 00:27:50,334
That's exactly why

779
00:27:50,434 --> 00:27:52,767
I think it's a pity to break a bond

780
00:27:52,867 --> 00:27:54,834
that we spent some forming.

781
00:27:55,000 --> 00:27:57,634
(Guan-Yu is upset about the fact
that someone is leaving)

782
00:27:57,734 --> 00:27:58,834
It's annoying.

783
00:27:59,634 --> 00:28:02,267
Nah, I just think I had a great dinner time

784
00:28:02,367 --> 00:28:03,334
but the thought of someone's leaving

785
00:28:03,434 --> 00:28:05,000
it made me.

786
00:28:05,100 --> 00:28:06,634
Am I gonna cry?

787
00:28:07,567 --> 00:28:09,334
Seriously, I had a great time during dinner.

788
00:28:09,434 --> 00:28:11,434
We kind of bonded a little.

789
00:28:11,534 --> 00:28:13,367
It was not a surprise to me.

790
00:28:15,334 --> 00:28:16,800
To be honest

791
00:28:16,900 --> 00:28:19,200
I feel like I've seen a lot

792
00:28:19,300 --> 00:28:21,600
I don't care
I just want to be with everyone else

793
00:28:21,700 --> 00:28:23,000
I guess it's probably time

794
00:28:23,100 --> 00:28:25,767
I just want to be with everybody.

795
00:28:26,534 --> 00:28:27,367
I'm the type of person

796
00:28:27,467 --> 00:28:31,767
who'd participate in club activities.

797
00:28:31,867 --> 00:28:34,167
(Nostalgic Guan-Yu imagines the foreseeable farewell)

798
00:28:34,267 --> 00:28:37,567
or when I'm about to leave a place.

799
00:28:43,134 --> 00:28:44,634
Coming out of nowhere, gosh.

800
00:28:45,300 --> 00:28:47,134
Because for me, it's a shame

801
00:28:47,234 --> 00:28:49,134
that I have to leave a place.

802
00:28:55,600 --> 00:28:59,600
(Double Room/Shi-Funh, Gino)

803
00:29:02,867 --> 00:29:06,634
(Shih-Feng gets tidied up again.
What is he planning to do...)

804
00:29:08,534 --> 00:29:09,867
I am very upset.

805
00:29:09,967 --> 00:29:10,967
Or let's get it straight.

806
00:29:11,067 --> 00:29:12,867
Oh.

807
00:29:13,067 --> 00:29:14,500
(After the break, everyone is back in the living room)

808
00:29:14,600 --> 00:29:15,134
I'm gonna veg out.

809
00:29:15,234 --> 00:29:16,267
Do you want to shower first?

810
00:29:16,367 --> 00:29:17,734
I'm gonna veg out.

811
00:29:17,834 --> 00:29:19,000
"Vac out"?

812
00:29:19,100 --> 00:29:20,034
Yeah, I'm gonna veg out.

813
00:29:20,134 --> 00:29:22,467
- Oh, veg out.
- Yeah, it's vegging out time.

814
00:29:22,567 --> 00:29:24,100
Let's all veg out.

815
00:29:26,667 --> 00:29:29,334
To be totally honest, I've been

816
00:29:29,434 --> 00:29:32,534
watching how Eri and NIO interact

817
00:29:32,634 --> 00:29:33,667
and this thing has somehow

818
00:29:33,767 --> 00:29:35,500
affected me a little.

819
00:29:35,600 --> 00:29:37,434
Plus, I always think the thing
going on between them

820
00:29:37,534 --> 00:29:38,600
is quite obvious already.

821
00:29:38,700 --> 00:29:40,034
However, when I'm sharing
this with other people

822
00:29:40,134 --> 00:29:41,467
they have the slightest clue

823
00:29:41,567 --> 00:29:43,967
I mean, when Eri and NIO had the lantern

824
00:29:44,067 --> 00:29:46,300
and walked side by side.

825
00:29:46,967 --> 00:29:48,967
Eri was the one making moves.

826
00:29:49,067 --> 00:29:50,600
(Earlier, Shih-Feng was checking if Gino thinks the same)
What did he do?

827
00:29:50,700 --> 00:29:51,934
You didn't notice it?

828
00:29:52,034 --> 00:29:54,767
Then it isn't that obvious, I guess.

829
00:29:55,400 --> 00:29:57,434
They sit across each other.

830
00:29:58,434 --> 00:29:59,267
Then what did you discover?

831
00:29:59,367 --> 00:30:02,300
The way he held that light.

832
00:30:02,600 --> 00:30:05,034
Don't you guys have this false idea

833
00:30:05,134 --> 00:30:07,034
that time runs faster in this house?

834
00:30:07,134 --> 00:30:08,234
- Absolutely.
- I think so, yes.

835
00:30:08,334 --> 00:30:09,534
Because we spend every minute together.

836
00:30:09,634 --> 00:30:11,900
Without going back to our separate home.

837
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:12,334
Yeah...

838
00:30:12,434 --> 00:30:14,634
Initially, we all came here
with a clear intention.

839
00:30:14,734 --> 00:30:18,034
Either making friends or finding a partner.

840
00:30:18,134 --> 00:30:21,367
So people are more tuned
in with their hearts

841
00:30:21,467 --> 00:30:23,267
to keep the flow going.

842
00:30:23,367 --> 00:30:25,067
Yeah, so I think

843
00:30:25,167 --> 00:30:26,500
I think I had a great day today.

844
00:30:26,600 --> 00:30:28,100
Mine couldn't be better. It is really fun.

845
00:30:28,200 --> 00:30:29,534
Yeah.

846
00:30:29,800 --> 00:30:31,167
There were only two of us doing chit-chat

847
00:30:31,267 --> 00:30:32,867
then everyone seemed to tag along.

848
00:30:34,400 --> 00:30:35,834
Well, I'll tell you this

849
00:30:35,934 --> 00:30:38,267
I want everyone to bring the drama gossip.

850
00:30:38,834 --> 00:30:39,534
What drama?

851
00:30:39,634 --> 00:30:42,000
Well, you know, everyone has a facade

852
00:30:42,100 --> 00:30:43,234
I'm alright, I'm not that guy.

853
00:30:43,334 --> 00:30:44,900
Oh my gosh.

854
00:30:46,367 --> 00:30:47,434
What facade?

855
00:30:47,534 --> 00:30:48,300
What?

856
00:30:48,400 --> 00:30:49,100
Nothing.

857
00:30:49,200 --> 00:30:49,834
(Shih-Feng seems eager to ask a question...)

858
00:30:49,934 --> 00:30:51,367
What a hard crew to join.

859
00:30:52,034 --> 00:30:55,134
He never finishes his sentence.

860
00:30:55,600 --> 00:30:57,400
I hate this kind of feeling.

861
00:30:57,634 --> 00:30:59,300
(Returning to their room one by one)
It's about bedtime.

862
00:31:03,700 --> 00:31:05,867
At the end, both of us stay and keep talking.

863
00:31:06,700 --> 00:31:08,334
What do you want to talk about?

864
00:31:08,834 --> 00:31:10,200
Give me a second.

865
00:31:10,300 --> 00:31:12,800
What? Are you still stressed?

866
00:31:13,300 --> 00:31:14,634
I won't say anything.

867
00:31:14,734 --> 00:31:15,700
Just shoot it.

868
00:31:15,800 --> 00:31:18,467
- No.
- Then pick one out of these two.

869
00:31:19,767 --> 00:31:21,500
Do you want to say what you told him

870
00:31:21,600 --> 00:31:23,900
or tell me who your crush is?

871
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:25,434
You are pushy.

872
00:31:25,534 --> 00:31:27,100
You have to pick one.

873
00:31:27,200 --> 00:31:29,367
The reason I bring up this topic is because

874
00:31:29,467 --> 00:31:30,834
I want to know more

875
00:31:30,934 --> 00:31:33,267
about the thing between NIO and him.

876
00:31:33,367 --> 00:31:36,334
Is there something going on between on?

877
00:31:36,434 --> 00:31:37,867
You would definitely know.

878
00:31:37,967 --> 00:31:40,200
Are you guys in there?

879
00:31:40,300 --> 00:31:41,967
In our own world?

880
00:31:42,067 --> 00:31:43,467
Me and him?

881
00:31:43,567 --> 00:31:44,000
Yeah.

882
00:31:44,100 --> 00:31:45,734
There's nothing going on

883
00:31:45,834 --> 00:31:47,100
I think he is still exploring

884
00:31:47,200 --> 00:31:48,800
each one of us.

885
00:31:48,900 --> 00:31:50,300
In my eyes

886
00:31:50,400 --> 00:31:51,867
he is that type of person.

887
00:31:51,967 --> 00:31:54,134
He'd just throw you some random

888
00:31:54,234 --> 00:31:56,567
candies or tenderness.

889
00:31:56,667 --> 00:31:58,734
No... right?

890
00:31:59,034 --> 00:32:02,000
So you didn't feel that?

891
00:32:03,067 --> 00:32:03,734
What do you mean?

892
00:32:03,834 --> 00:32:06,167
I gotta say, I'm pretty clumsy sometimes.

893
00:32:06,900 --> 00:32:09,400
Yeah, sometime he would.

894
00:32:10,834 --> 00:32:13,534
You know, like a sudden affectionate look.

895
00:32:13,634 --> 00:32:15,334
- To send you electricity.
- But personally

896
00:32:15,434 --> 00:32:15,934
in my opinion

897
00:32:16,034 --> 00:32:18,967
that's just how his eyes are originally.

898
00:32:19,067 --> 00:32:21,534
- Quite reasonable.
- You've got a point.

899
00:32:21,634 --> 00:32:24,367
Yeah, so I wouldn't take it seriously

900
00:32:24,467 --> 00:32:26,867
to mistake it for something more.

901
00:32:26,967 --> 00:32:27,867
Subjectively speaking

902
00:32:27,967 --> 00:32:30,634
he is pretty interested in NIO.

903
00:32:30,734 --> 00:32:33,234
However, during the conversation

904
00:32:33,334 --> 00:32:36,367
he kept emphasizing that it was enough.

905
00:32:36,467 --> 00:32:37,667
But I could still tell

906
00:32:37,767 --> 00:32:38,934
when he was interacting with NIO

907
00:32:39,034 --> 00:32:41,000
he noticed a lot of details

908
00:32:41,100 --> 00:32:43,300
during his encounters with NIO

909
00:32:43,400 --> 00:32:44,634
and the hidden messages.

910
00:32:45,300 --> 00:32:47,234
Yeah, that is why

911
00:32:47,334 --> 00:32:49,267
I think he did what he did

912
00:32:49,367 --> 00:32:51,967
because he was forced to take care of me.

913
00:32:52,067 --> 00:32:53,634
So I later told him.

914
00:32:53,734 --> 00:32:55,867
(Eri shares his assumption with NIO)
you can go find the person he likes.

915
00:32:55,967 --> 00:32:57,067
Actually, I wouldn't mind it.

916
00:32:57,167 --> 00:32:59,167
This opportunity is very rare.

917
00:32:59,267 --> 00:33:02,534
Just hurry up, since not
that many days have left.

918
00:33:02,634 --> 00:33:05,300
If you're leaving tomorrow
I'll spare no details for you

919
00:33:05,400 --> 00:33:05,834
(suddenly standing up)
Good night.

920
00:33:05,934 --> 00:33:07,867
It won't be me who leave tomorrow.

921
00:33:08,100 --> 00:33:09,634
Well, I might be leaving.

922
00:33:09,867 --> 00:33:12,134
You promised me you'd tell me one of those.

923
00:33:12,900 --> 00:33:13,900
You are so sneaky.

924
00:33:14,000 --> 00:33:16,534
(Shih-Feng left the table without saying anything)
I'm gonna go mingle with those four.

925
00:33:16,967 --> 00:33:19,434
I think there's nothing there.

926
00:33:20,367 --> 00:33:21,300
(Double Room/Guan-Yu, NIO)

927
00:33:21,400 --> 00:33:22,300
(knocking)

928
00:33:22,400 --> 00:33:24,500
Come in.

929
00:33:24,600 --> 00:33:27,200
(Shih-Feng visited NIO's room...)
- Is he showering? - Yeah... what's wrong?

930
00:33:27,300 --> 00:33:27,967
Nothing, nothing.

931
00:33:28,067 --> 00:33:30,100
You're getting ready to go to bed.

932
00:33:30,200 --> 00:33:32,034
Almost that time, yeah.

933
00:33:32,134 --> 00:33:33,234
Got it.

934
00:33:33,334 --> 00:33:34,034
What?

935
00:33:34,134 --> 00:33:34,934
(peeking)(around)
Nothing, really.

936
00:33:35,034 --> 00:33:36,467
What do you want to talk about?

937
00:33:36,567 --> 00:33:37,300
Nothing in particular.

938
00:33:37,400 --> 00:33:40,067
Just want to see if you guys are hanging out.

939
00:33:40,167 --> 00:33:40,867
Good night.

940
00:33:40,967 --> 00:33:42,367
Good night

941
00:33:44,734 --> 00:33:46,234
(turning off)(turning on)

942
00:33:49,967 --> 00:33:52,467
Shih-Feng was here a minute ago and just left.

943
00:33:54,800 --> 00:33:56,734
What? Are you surprised?

944
00:33:56,834 --> 00:33:57,967
Surprise? A little.

945
00:33:58,067 --> 00:33:59,100
About which part?

946
00:33:59,200 --> 00:34:00,900
Do I like him?

947
00:34:01,000 --> 00:34:03,867
Yeah, I guess it's NIO.

948
00:34:03,967 --> 00:34:05,600
Actually, I'm a little...

949
00:34:06,667 --> 00:34:08,234
It felt quite good that I guessed it right.

950
00:34:08,334 --> 00:34:09,934
When I thought about it later

951
00:34:10,034 --> 00:34:11,467
it almost seemed like

952
00:34:11,567 --> 00:34:15,667
it's possible that I lost a chance

953
00:34:16,034 --> 00:34:20,734
(concluding this both thrilling and joyful night
with a nervous heart)

954
00:34:22,534 --> 00:34:26,467
(DAY 4)

955
00:34:27,434 --> 00:34:31,767
(Double Room/Guan-Yu, NIO)

956
00:34:38,434 --> 00:34:43,800
(Double Room/Eri, Bobo)

957
00:34:43,900 --> 00:34:45,067
There's no sound.

958
00:34:45,167 --> 00:34:47,800
Yeah, there's no sound.

959
00:34:50,100 --> 00:34:54,000
(Double Room/Shih-Feng, Gino)

960
00:34:54,334 --> 00:34:55,767
(folding the blanket is a must-do)

961
00:35:00,667 --> 00:35:02,434
What time did you chat until yesterday?

962
00:35:02,534 --> 00:35:05,667
Around twelve forty.

963
00:35:05,767 --> 00:35:07,434
Because I could still hear

964
00:35:07,534 --> 00:35:08,967
the sound of talking

965
00:35:09,067 --> 00:35:10,834
from the room next door.

966
00:35:19,967 --> 00:35:21,367
Did you know the camera is rolling.

967
00:35:21,467 --> 00:35:23,000
Yeah, I'm working out.

968
00:35:23,467 --> 00:35:25,100
You worked out in there?

969
00:35:25,200 --> 00:35:26,867
Working out with Eri.

970
00:35:29,834 --> 00:35:33,000
If Bobo has a thing for Gino

971
00:35:34,067 --> 00:35:36,934
it is quite unbelievable.

972
00:35:37,534 --> 00:35:38,467
I'm dying to see

973
00:35:38,567 --> 00:35:40,834
how he and Gino interact.

974
00:35:40,934 --> 00:35:41,700
Do you want it?

975
00:35:41,800 --> 00:35:43,100
Can I come in?

976
00:35:43,200 --> 00:35:44,467
Come on in.

977
00:35:46,334 --> 00:35:50,200
(Suddenly more people popped up...)
This small room is getting crowded.

978
00:35:52,200 --> 00:35:53,834
Do you want this?

979
00:35:55,434 --> 00:35:56,900
(When everyone is training their muscles...)
I'm filming it.

980
00:35:57,000 --> 00:35:58,634
Someone likes him

981
00:35:58,734 --> 00:35:59,567
I've noticed that.

982
00:35:59,667 --> 00:36:00,700
(Guan-Yu and NIO are still in bed...)
And you're being like this.

983
00:36:00,800 --> 00:36:03,467
Gino wouldn't speak to him.

984
00:36:03,567 --> 00:36:05,800
Gino will speak with you.

985
00:36:05,900 --> 00:36:09,300
- Everyone knows.
- Let's just wait and see.

986
00:36:09,934 --> 00:36:12,800
Your attitude of enjoying the show.

987
00:36:12,900 --> 00:36:13,867
Gotta bring this out.

988
00:36:13,967 --> 00:36:15,300
Not sure if at eight twenty...

989
00:36:15,400 --> 00:36:18,200
Yeah, it's twenty now, guys
Time to go down.

990
00:36:19,567 --> 00:36:20,700
What should I wear to work out?

991
00:36:20,800 --> 00:36:22,634
Just wear whatever you want, morning.

992
00:36:22,734 --> 00:36:24,600
Is this our workout outfit?

993
00:36:24,700 --> 00:36:26,967
I'm not planning to wear them now.

994
00:36:27,334 --> 00:36:27,800
But I don't know

995
00:36:27,900 --> 00:36:30,300
I'm not sure which outfit
I should wear to the workout

996
00:36:30,400 --> 00:36:32,034
I guess it's a simple one.

997
00:36:38,467 --> 00:36:41,634
- Dang, it is a serious workout.
- Morning.

998
00:36:41,734 --> 00:36:44,067
(Let's enjoy the sunshine together and move your body!)
I guess I should go change.

999
00:36:44,167 --> 00:36:46,534
How come you didn't take this goodie out sooner?

1000
00:36:48,300 --> 00:36:49,934
You seem happy

1001
00:36:53,500 --> 00:36:55,200
(satisfied)
I love the sun.

1002
00:37:00,167 --> 00:37:01,500
You can just watch them exercising.

1003
00:37:01,600 --> 00:37:03,200
Yeah, you can watch me when I'm exercising.

1004
00:37:18,567 --> 00:37:20,234
How come everyone doesn't warm up first.

1005
00:37:20,767 --> 00:37:22,100
Well, teach me how.

1006
00:37:22,200 --> 00:37:24,434
You gotta pull your chest in

1007
00:37:24,534 --> 00:37:27,767
(professional Guan-Yu teaches everyone how to stretch)
Put your hands beside your thighs and slide down.

1008
00:37:27,867 --> 00:37:28,834
Pull your abdominal in.

1009
00:37:28,934 --> 00:37:29,967
When you get up.

1010
00:37:30,067 --> 00:37:32,134
Pretending you're like a wave.

1011
00:37:32,234 --> 00:37:33,534
Yeah, after you get up, press it back

1012
00:37:33,634 --> 00:37:35,100
and come scrolling back.

1013
00:37:45,067 --> 00:37:46,500
Keep your eyes on the right.

1014
00:37:46,600 --> 00:37:49,300
Now you're just like a yoga teacher.

1015
00:38:02,600 --> 00:38:05,200
(Embrace today's itineraries
with some happy sweats!)

1016
00:38:08,367 --> 00:38:09,600
Take it slow.

1017
00:38:09,700 --> 00:38:10,567
Yeah.

1018
00:38:10,734 --> 00:38:12,434
My hand will guide your hips

1019
00:38:12,534 --> 00:38:14,900
and you have to keep going, yeah.

1020
00:38:26,267 --> 00:38:27,334
(Double Room/Guan-Yu, NIO)
A great coach.

1021
00:38:27,434 --> 00:38:29,834
Stop that nonsense.

1022
00:38:29,934 --> 00:38:32,834
There is no great coach.

1023
00:38:32,934 --> 00:38:33,600
Great coach.

1024
00:38:33,700 --> 00:38:34,767
Nah

1025
00:38:34,867 --> 00:38:37,634
I'm not, I'm not that fit.

1026
00:38:37,734 --> 00:38:39,234
It's not a matter of that.

1027
00:38:39,334 --> 00:38:40,967
Yeah, you've got a point.

1028
00:38:41,067 --> 00:38:42,434
Can I take a shower first?

1029
00:38:42,534 --> 00:38:44,167
Sure, you can go first.

1030
00:38:44,334 --> 00:38:46,334
(Double Room/Shih-Feng, Gino)

1031
00:38:46,434 --> 00:38:48,667
Hi, please come in.

1032
00:38:49,334 --> 00:38:50,600
He's using the bathroom.

1033
00:38:50,700 --> 00:38:51,834
That's right.

1034
00:38:52,034 --> 00:38:53,300
Can we dig in yet?

1035
00:38:53,400 --> 00:38:54,200
It's not sure yet?

1036
00:38:54,300 --> 00:38:56,434
I haven't gotten my ready
but NIO is using my...

1037
00:38:56,767 --> 00:38:59,234
Guan-Yu wants to use the bathroom

1038
00:38:59,334 --> 00:39:00,300
I'm almost ready.

1039
00:39:00,400 --> 00:39:01,434
You're almost ready.

1040
00:39:01,534 --> 00:39:03,400
Do you want to come in?

1041
00:39:04,967 --> 00:39:08,800
(Double Room/Eri, Bobo)

1042
00:39:11,300 --> 00:39:13,200
Let me show it to the camera

1043
00:39:13,767 --> 00:39:15,534
(satisfied)
Eri helped me with my hair.

1044
00:39:15,934 --> 00:39:17,500
Looks good, huh.

1045
00:39:18,134 --> 00:39:19,300
Is it different?

1046
00:39:19,500 --> 00:39:20,767
It is.

1047
00:39:21,067 --> 00:39:23,767
It takes three minutes for me to do this.

1048
00:39:24,634 --> 00:39:25,634
He is old.

1049
00:39:25,834 --> 00:39:26,600
What?

1050
00:39:26,700 --> 00:39:27,967
I said he's old.

1051
00:39:28,400 --> 00:39:30,600
Get up, just get up.

1052
00:39:30,700 --> 00:39:31,734
Look at you.

1053
00:39:32,834 --> 00:39:34,267
You scared me.

1054
00:39:34,367 --> 00:39:36,567
(Double Room/Susu, Jia-Hang)
I think there isn't many activities today.

1055
00:39:37,067 --> 00:39:38,434
Everyone is wearing a lot.

1056
00:39:38,534 --> 00:39:39,134
Yeah

1057
00:39:39,234 --> 00:39:40,567
I bet after this thing in the morning

1058
00:39:40,667 --> 00:39:42,634
it'll be a fun and casual date

1059
00:39:42,734 --> 00:39:44,434
hanging out with someone.

1060
00:39:46,634 --> 00:39:48,300
I'm gonna sit here today.

1061
00:39:48,567 --> 00:39:49,834
Is this coffee?

1062
00:39:49,934 --> 00:39:52,167
The coffee I've been longing for a long time ago?

1063
00:39:52,534 --> 00:39:53,800
Morning.

1064
00:39:54,334 --> 00:39:55,734
Sorry... are you sitting here?

1065
00:39:55,834 --> 00:39:56,300
I'm fine either way

1066
00:39:56,400 --> 00:39:57,234
I'm gonna sit here.

1067
00:39:57,334 --> 00:39:59,434
Nah, I'm planning to steal your seat later.

1068
00:39:59,867 --> 00:40:02,334
Morning.

1069
00:40:03,100 --> 00:40:04,300
That looks delicious.

1070
00:40:06,900 --> 00:40:08,467
Then I'm taking this seat.

1071
00:40:08,767 --> 00:40:09,534
That's my spot.

1072
00:40:09,634 --> 00:40:10,800
Oh, sorry.

1073
00:40:11,634 --> 00:40:13,934
(It's another breakfast time!)
Wow, look at that.

1074
00:40:14,034 --> 00:40:15,534
That is one of the YouTubers.

1075
00:40:15,634 --> 00:40:16,767
You mean playwithshen?

1076
00:40:16,867 --> 00:40:19,434
- Yeah, that's him.
- Really? Cool.

1077
00:40:21,200 --> 00:40:22,067
Did NIO have one?

1078
00:40:22,167 --> 00:40:23,267
What do you want?

1079
00:40:24,067 --> 00:40:25,167
Whatever is fine.

1080
00:40:25,434 --> 00:40:27,000
Do you want the strawberry or taro one?

1081
00:40:28,167 --> 00:40:29,934
Not into a particular one.

1082
00:40:30,034 --> 00:40:30,800
Let's share them.

1083
00:40:30,900 --> 00:40:32,234
Let's share them.

1084
00:40:32,900 --> 00:40:33,900
Your pick

1085
00:40:34,000 --> 00:40:35,334
I'm fine with either one.

1086
00:40:36,767 --> 00:40:38,067
The way you're passing it repeatedly

1087
00:40:38,167 --> 00:40:41,767
it's like we are in the American TV show.

1088
00:40:42,234 --> 00:40:43,667
I like it.

1089
00:40:44,767 --> 00:40:46,534
Look at these stuffings.

1090
00:40:46,634 --> 00:40:48,567
Yeah, it was a lot.

1091
00:40:49,500 --> 00:40:52,600
- I'd never think Taro go well with this.
- It tastes great.

1092
00:40:52,700 --> 00:40:54,934
This creamy one tastes salty, too.

1093
00:40:55,034 --> 00:40:56,000
Fantastic

1094
00:40:56,100 --> 00:40:57,234
I like it.

1095
00:40:57,434 --> 00:40:59,100
(The house is filled with joy)

1096
00:40:59,200 --> 00:41:01,200
(windy)

1097
00:41:01,900 --> 00:41:03,000
(Outside, however, the clouds are getting darker)
Mind if I grab a bite?

1098
00:41:03,100 --> 00:41:04,734
- Is the typhoon here?
- The wind from the typhoon?

1099
00:41:04,834 --> 00:41:06,134
Yeah, the typhoon.

1100
00:41:06,234 --> 00:41:07,500
Isn't the typhoon gone already?

1101
00:41:07,600 --> 00:41:09,034
- It went north.
- It went north.

1102
00:41:09,134 --> 00:41:10,500
So the wind would be...

1103
00:41:10,600 --> 00:41:13,900
At this typhoon night
I'm gonna be leaving alone, feeling upset.

1104
00:41:14,367 --> 00:41:15,900
You've been thinking about this?

1105
00:41:16,000 --> 00:41:18,300
- What?
- He... this morning

1106
00:41:18,400 --> 00:41:19,467
(everyone talk about how they feel about the news)
I was so anxious that.

1107
00:41:19,567 --> 00:41:21,434
That I couldn't do number two.

1108
00:41:21,534 --> 00:41:22,434
It made me so anxious, too.

1109
00:41:22,534 --> 00:41:23,434
What, what did you say?

1110
00:41:23,534 --> 00:41:24,400
I'm saying that

1111
00:41:24,500 --> 00:41:26,634
the fact that someone's leaving.

1112
00:41:27,434 --> 00:41:28,167
A little bit, yeah.

1113
00:41:28,267 --> 00:41:29,100
It was you?

1114
00:41:29,200 --> 00:41:30,567
No, I mean

1115
00:41:30,667 --> 00:41:32,200
the fact that someone is leaving us.

1116
00:41:32,734 --> 00:41:34,200
Nah, I don't think that's important.

1117
00:41:34,300 --> 00:41:35,434
What's important is
that we are having this meal together.

1118
00:41:35,534 --> 00:41:36,700
Yeah.

1119
00:41:37,134 --> 00:41:38,100
Good speech.

1120
00:41:38,200 --> 00:41:39,300
It's the truth
We're all gonna be gone eventually.

1121
00:41:39,400 --> 00:41:40,300
God, the truth itself.

1122
00:41:40,634 --> 00:41:42,067
Yeah, it's sooner or later

1123
00:41:42,167 --> 00:41:43,600
I Love Eri.

1124
00:41:43,967 --> 00:41:45,200
(NIO finally shows up...)

1125
00:41:45,300 --> 00:41:46,267
Sorry.

1126
00:41:46,367 --> 00:41:47,334
There is.

1127
00:41:47,434 --> 00:41:48,934
Morning.

1128
00:41:49,034 --> 00:41:50,800
There is an issue with the necklace.

1129
00:41:50,900 --> 00:41:52,834
- It went on for a while.
- No worries.

1130
00:41:53,934 --> 00:41:55,900
Do you guys think that switching to single beds

1131
00:41:56,000 --> 00:41:57,700
made you sleep better?

1132
00:41:57,800 --> 00:41:59,667
Isn't it harder?

1133
00:41:59,767 --> 00:42:01,700
Actually, we slept better.

1134
00:42:01,800 --> 00:42:03,034
- Oh, really.
- Excellent, that's great.

1135
00:42:03,134 --> 00:42:04,167
Yeah.

1136
00:42:04,700 --> 00:42:05,367
Isn't it?

1137
00:42:05,467 --> 00:42:07,267
(NIO's meaningful is...)
I think I slept better.

1138
00:42:07,667 --> 00:42:08,400
I slept better.

1139
00:42:08,500 --> 00:42:09,467
Yeah.

1140
00:42:09,567 --> 00:42:11,067
(Last night, in Guan-Yu's and NIO's room)
Later.

1141
00:42:11,167 --> 00:42:14,634
What do you think about the interview?

1142
00:42:14,734 --> 00:42:17,367
What do I feel about the interview?

1143
00:42:17,900 --> 00:42:20,534
So what exactly did you spill?

1144
00:42:23,000 --> 00:42:24,400
You know, I was wondering

1145
00:42:24,500 --> 00:42:26,600
if I could be a bit more mysterious.

1146
00:42:26,700 --> 00:42:29,034
Eventually, I guess it's not in me.

1147
00:42:29,134 --> 00:42:30,800
Yeah, you like to share things.

1148
00:42:30,900 --> 00:42:34,134
(Guan-Yu and Gino talked throughout the night, heart-to-heart conversation)
Yeah, did I mention that you were popular this time?

1149
00:42:34,234 --> 00:42:34,867
I'm popular?

1150
00:42:34,967 --> 00:42:36,267
I think you are popular.

1151
00:42:36,367 --> 00:42:37,834
When we lived in the quadruple

1152
00:42:37,934 --> 00:42:40,200
I shared this with Shih-Feng.

1153
00:42:40,300 --> 00:42:42,200
Like, we both observed.

1154
00:42:42,600 --> 00:42:45,800
(NIO knows Gino's affection for Guan-Yu...)
whtat Gino did to you and like...

1155
00:42:45,900 --> 00:42:46,967
Yeah, I think a little.

1156
00:42:47,067 --> 00:42:48,000
Not a little.

1157
00:42:48,100 --> 00:42:50,700
Come on, don't play dumb.

1158
00:42:52,234 --> 00:42:55,434
I did say Gino is...

1159
00:42:55,534 --> 00:42:58,000
passionate, but I have
my protective wall in front of him.

1160
00:42:58,100 --> 00:43:01,000
Because I think he's very friendly to everyone.

1161
00:43:01,100 --> 00:43:03,200
Then do you have the wall in front of me?

1162
00:43:03,300 --> 00:43:05,167
Less of it

1163
00:43:05,267 --> 00:43:07,134
I think the wall is not as high.

1164
00:43:07,234 --> 00:43:08,800
(Guan-Yu shares his thoughts on Gino and NIO...)
You offer me more sense of

1165
00:43:08,900 --> 00:43:09,934
security.

1166
00:43:10,200 --> 00:43:12,534
But I think what he did

1167
00:43:12,634 --> 00:43:16,267
in the public places

1168
00:43:16,367 --> 00:43:17,800
were far more than what I did.

1169
00:43:17,900 --> 00:43:19,567
Yeah, it's true, but I'm also wondering

1170
00:43:19,667 --> 00:43:21,900
if that is his working mode.

1171
00:43:23,134 --> 00:43:25,600
Are you curious about my choice?

1172
00:43:25,700 --> 00:43:26,534
Sure.

1173
00:43:26,634 --> 00:43:28,134
(NIO reveals his choice at the dinner tonight...)
- Yes or no - Yes.

1174
00:43:28,234 --> 00:43:29,867
Yes, okay.

1175
00:43:30,534 --> 00:43:32,234
Only you.

1176
00:43:32,334 --> 00:43:34,900
Seriously? I'm blushing.

1177
00:43:35,900 --> 00:43:36,500
Are you kidding me?

1178
00:43:36,600 --> 00:43:37,134
No.

1179
00:43:37,500 --> 00:43:38,534
It's like the theory

1180
00:43:38,634 --> 00:43:41,934
of attraction, you know.

1181
00:43:42,700 --> 00:43:44,867
I think, personally

1182
00:43:45,300 --> 00:43:47,034
the only person

1183
00:43:47,134 --> 00:43:49,834
whom I want to date in my own way is you.

1184
00:43:49,934 --> 00:43:51,867
Yeah, but I'm scared if I say this out loud

1185
00:43:51,967 --> 00:43:52,900
I'll put pressure on you

1186
00:43:53,000 --> 00:43:55,067
I'm fine with it and I'm chill.

1187
00:43:55,667 --> 00:43:56,800
If you feel like meeting other people

1188
00:43:56,900 --> 00:43:58,000
then please do

1189
00:43:58,100 --> 00:44:01,167
I won't stop you from doing it.

1190
00:44:01,267 --> 00:44:03,134
We got close last night.

1191
00:44:03,234 --> 00:44:04,467
Well, last night.

1192
00:44:04,567 --> 00:44:07,000
He also told me that chatting with me

1193
00:44:07,100 --> 00:44:10,034
offers him peace and security.

1194
00:44:10,134 --> 00:44:12,334
He also likes my existence.

1195
00:44:12,434 --> 00:44:15,200
(Both give each other a hug of trustˇK)

1196
00:44:18,534 --> 00:44:19,667
Don't worry.

1197
00:44:20,034 --> 00:44:21,367
Keep having fun tomorrow.

1198
00:44:21,467 --> 00:44:22,567
Yeah...

1199
00:44:25,867 --> 00:44:28,334
- Have a good rest.
- Okay, you two.

1200
00:44:29,767 --> 00:44:31,134
I'm seriously blushing.

1201
00:44:31,234 --> 00:44:32,134
It's alright.

1202
00:44:32,234 --> 00:44:34,000
It's been a while.

1203
00:44:34,834 --> 00:44:36,800
- Yeah, a long time.
- To have this...

1204
00:44:36,900 --> 00:44:38,900
It's been a while since.

1205
00:44:39,567 --> 00:44:42,900
I really spent time talking with another person.

1206
00:44:43,934 --> 00:44:45,567
Yeah, actually on your first day

1207
00:44:45,667 --> 00:44:46,967
when you hugged me, I was shocked.

1208
00:44:47,067 --> 00:44:48,967
But I'm cool with it.

1209
00:44:49,400 --> 00:44:50,867
I feel like.

1210
00:44:51,500 --> 00:44:54,534
Cool with it. Not liking it but cool with it.

1211
00:44:54,634 --> 00:44:57,200
Don't even start.

1212
00:44:57,300 --> 00:44:59,534
Of course, I like it.

1213
00:45:00,334 --> 00:45:01,867
We shared a little moment

1214
00:45:01,967 --> 00:45:03,534
which was kind of romantic and shy.

1215
00:45:03,634 --> 00:45:07,667
Plus, it made me feel young.

1216
00:45:07,767 --> 00:45:10,167
Like it was really youthful.

1217
00:45:10,267 --> 00:45:12,134
Right in the room.

1218
00:45:12,234 --> 00:45:13,934
- Sleeping.
- Yeah, we have to sleep in different beds.

1219
00:45:14,034 --> 00:45:15,467
OK

1220
00:45:15,967 --> 00:45:17,200
Good night.

1221
00:45:25,134 --> 00:45:28,434
(Would Guan-Yu and NIO's secret moment
affect how things play out eventually?

1222
00:45:28,767 --> 00:45:30,700
One of the parts fell off.

1223
00:45:31,400 --> 00:45:32,900
Yeah, it just snapped.

1224
00:45:33,000 --> 00:45:34,267
(After the breakfast, let's wait for the announcement)
Do it with your nails

1225
00:45:34,367 --> 00:45:35,534
I'll do it.

1226
00:45:35,634 --> 00:45:36,800
He's got sharp claws.

1227
00:45:36,900 --> 00:45:39,000
Yeah, everyone tried that yesterday

1228
00:45:39,100 --> 00:45:40,134
I want you to use this.

1229
00:45:40,234 --> 00:45:41,467
No way.

1230
00:45:41,567 --> 00:45:43,867
He will literally nail it
I think it's scary

1231
00:45:46,167 --> 00:45:46,967
(the chime comes in)

1232
00:45:47,067 --> 00:45:48,600
Here it is.

1233
00:45:49,467 --> 00:45:52,267
(The Special Rule today: Only two groups of people could go on dates successfully)

1234
00:45:53,867 --> 00:46:00,067
(Rule/Think of it as your last day here
Please select one member you'd like to go out with and send it back to the crew)

1235
00:46:00,700 --> 00:46:02,200
(Talking is not allowed before the result announcement)

1236
00:46:02,300 --> 00:46:03,134
(sighing)

1237
00:46:05,767 --> 00:46:08,600
(worried)

1238
00:46:20,634 --> 00:46:21,234
I noticed something

1239
00:46:21,334 --> 00:46:23,100
something unusual about NIO

1240
00:46:23,200 --> 00:46:25,867
which is that he kind of
lost control of himself.

1241
00:46:25,967 --> 00:46:29,767
He was shaking after he picked one person.

1242
00:46:29,867 --> 00:46:32,534
He was a little affected

1243
00:46:32,634 --> 00:46:33,567
by this whole activity

1244
00:46:33,667 --> 00:46:35,534
I guess is that he really

1245
00:46:35,634 --> 00:46:37,900
has feelings for one of us here.

1246
00:46:39,367 --> 00:46:41,067
Genuinely speaking.

1247
00:46:41,167 --> 00:46:42,734
Guan-Yu could go explore different options

1248
00:46:42,834 --> 00:46:44,500
to know different people.

1249
00:46:44,600 --> 00:46:47,167
Because me liking you is how I feel.

1250
00:46:47,267 --> 00:46:49,200
Whether you like me or someone else

1251
00:46:49,300 --> 00:46:50,100
that's your thing.

1252
00:46:50,200 --> 00:46:54,034
(Guan-Yu seems to make the final call...)

1253
00:46:57,034 --> 00:47:01,767
(The text will say the result of the match)

1254
00:47:02,234 --> 00:47:05,100
(what kind of result makes everyone frown...)

1255
00:47:18,567 --> 00:47:21,100
I think the rule of this game should be

1256
00:47:21,200 --> 00:47:22,634
if you and I didn't choose each other

1257
00:47:22,734 --> 00:47:26,034
then if I have two or
more people to choose from

1258
00:47:26,134 --> 00:47:27,667
I get to choose again.

1259
00:47:28,100 --> 00:47:35,934
(The text sneds the result again)

1260
00:47:37,567 --> 00:47:38,400
Alright, we can talk now.

1261
00:47:38,500 --> 00:47:39,467
Yeah

1262
00:47:42,367 --> 00:47:45,267
(one choice made in silence)

1263
00:47:45,367 --> 00:47:49,134
(will everyone trust their gut
or just suppressing their real emotions...?)
