1
00:00:02,933 --> 00:00:08,933
(Previously)

2
00:00:09,033 --> 00:00:10,500
Bye.

3
00:00:16,274 --> 00:00:20,440
Please select a double tent you want to live in.

4
00:00:20,833 --> 00:00:24,600
There are dating itineraries
that are free to exchange later.

5
00:00:24,700 --> 00:00:27,200
How about we pick the farm activity.

6
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:29,200
Do you want to trade with me?

7
00:00:29,300 --> 00:00:30,867
Look at his expression.

8
00:00:30,967 --> 00:00:32,533
He wants to stay indoors, doesn't he?

9
00:00:32,633 --> 00:00:35,300
Me and Susu are going fruit-picking.

10
00:00:35,400 --> 00:00:37,733
We will be farmers.

11
00:00:38,200 --> 00:00:41,500
Let's go make jam

12
00:00:41,600 --> 00:00:42,900
I think you're gonna fail.

13
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:45,733
We aren't in a rush, just like love

14
00:00:45,833 --> 00:00:47,167
I agree.

15
00:00:47,282 --> 00:00:50,015
Love will come haunt you in half a year.

16
00:00:50,100 --> 00:00:52,300
It's terrifying.

17
00:01:00,300 --> 00:01:01,267
(Bobo)

18
00:01:01,367 --> 00:01:03,033
(Shi-Fung)

19
00:01:03,133 --> 00:01:04,433
(NIO)

20
00:01:04,533 --> 00:01:05,733
(Gino)

21
00:01:05,833 --> 00:01:07,333
(Guan-Yu)

22
00:01:07,433 --> 00:01:08,733
(Eri)

23
00:01:08,833 --> 00:01:10,367
(Susu)

24
00:01:10,467 --> 00:01:12,200
(Jia-Hang)

25
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:19,600
(Boys Like Boys)

26
00:01:19,600 --> 00:01:22,400
(Episode 9: I think I'm in love with U)

27
00:01:28,409 --> 00:01:29,276
(Bobo and Eri's happy farm date)
Where are we going?

28
00:01:29,400 --> 00:01:32,367
We are heading to a farm today.

29
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:35,367
I guess pulling carrots
is one of the activities

30
00:01:35,467 --> 00:01:35,767
I have no idea.

31
00:01:35,867 --> 00:01:38,400
You mean pulling carrots?

32
00:01:38,500 --> 00:01:41,533
Hey yo, hey yo, pulling carrots.

33
00:01:42,441 --> 00:01:43,341
Shouldn't we be romantic?

34
00:01:43,433 --> 00:01:44,300
Take a seat?

35
00:01:44,400 --> 00:01:45,133
Should we?

36
00:01:45,241 --> 00:01:47,075
- I don't care. Give me a push.
- Sure.

37
00:01:47,500 --> 00:01:48,700
(Go for a romantic swing
before the farm date)

38
00:01:48,800 --> 00:01:50,067
Earlier on the car today

39
00:01:50,167 --> 00:01:51,667
why did you cry?

40
00:01:52,233 --> 00:01:53,200
- Humor me.
- I didn't cry.

41
00:01:53,300 --> 00:01:54,767
Yes, you did.

42
00:01:55,133 --> 00:01:56,700
Weren't you having a good cry, too?

43
00:01:56,800 --> 00:01:58,867
You cried first.

44
00:01:59,733 --> 00:02:02,267
- What? Scared to tell me?
- We'll talk about it in the interview.

45
00:02:02,367 --> 00:02:03,933
Sure...

46
00:02:06,200 --> 00:02:08,267
(Question/Why did you cry on the bus?)
I was touched in a way, feeling like

47
00:02:08,367 --> 00:02:10,167
I was moved to tears.

48
00:02:10,433 --> 00:02:11,333
(Earlier on the bus)

49
00:02:11,433 --> 00:02:14,633
Gino and Guan-Yu
were sitting in front of me.

50
00:02:14,733 --> 00:02:16,733
Seeing their interactions

51
00:02:16,833 --> 00:02:19,500
somehow really touched me.

52
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:21,400
When you have feelings for someone

53
00:02:21,500 --> 00:02:23,600
you won't necessarily end up together.

54
00:02:23,700 --> 00:02:26,167
Not being together is
also one of the options.

55
00:02:26,267 --> 00:02:28,800
Not that I was feeling sad.

56
00:02:28,900 --> 00:02:32,167
It's been a while since my emotions

57
00:02:32,267 --> 00:02:34,400
were comfortably let out of my system.

58
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:38,367
What veggies are we picking today?

59
00:02:39,467 --> 00:02:43,367
- Is this the one?
- Just twist it?

60
00:02:44,700 --> 00:02:45,733
Very professional.

61
00:02:45,833 --> 00:02:47,067
Very professional.

62
00:02:47,167 --> 00:02:49,867
Two for fifty... come on.

63
00:02:50,700 --> 00:02:55,100
(They still get each other even
though they aren't roommates anymore)

64
00:02:55,433 --> 00:02:58,100
Is this green pepper or chili?

65
00:02:58,200 --> 00:02:59,833
I am the chili.

66
00:02:59,933 --> 00:03:00,767
Fine.

67
00:03:02,633 --> 00:03:05,333
The flower fell off. There you are.

68
00:03:05,433 --> 00:03:07,633
Not good. It looks tacky.

69
00:03:07,709 --> 00:03:10,376
(There is always laughter on their date)
Sorry, this is ridiculous.

70
00:03:18,233 --> 00:03:19,333
If these are for our friends

71
00:03:19,433 --> 00:03:22,100
should we get the grass over there?

72
00:03:22,200 --> 00:03:24,400
- Yeah, these are for them anyways.
- They are eating it

73
00:03:24,500 --> 00:03:25,700
I don't care.

74
00:03:25,800 --> 00:03:27,767
Yeah, grass for them.

75
00:03:28,900 --> 00:03:30,867
How would I know it's ripe?

76
00:03:30,967 --> 00:03:33,733
- I mean, when can I pick it up?
- Just pinch it.

77
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:35,733
Well, how about we try this?

78
00:03:40,033 --> 00:03:41,033
My hands are clean.

79
00:03:41,133 --> 00:03:42,133
It's not ripe.

80
00:03:42,233 --> 00:03:43,200
How did you know?

81
00:03:43,300 --> 00:03:44,667
Do it one more time.

82
00:03:45,533 --> 00:03:47,800
(This friendship is as
precious as romantic love)

83
00:03:47,900 --> 00:03:49,967
Hold the top, like this.

84
00:03:50,067 --> 00:03:51,700
What a bright person.

85
00:03:51,800 --> 00:03:52,967
Come on

86
00:03:53,067 --> 00:03:54,633
I thought the date was gonna be lame.

87
00:03:54,733 --> 00:03:57,433
It ended up being an interesting one.

88
00:04:10,567 --> 00:04:11,600
(Gino and Susu go on fruit-picking date)
I feel like.

89
00:04:11,700 --> 00:04:12,867
Do you wanna pick this first?

90
00:04:12,967 --> 00:04:13,500
Yeah.

91
00:04:13,600 --> 00:04:14,533
Alright.

92
00:04:15,433 --> 00:04:16,967
It's my first time doing this.

93
00:04:17,200 --> 00:04:17,933
(What sparkles would be ignited
with brand-new matches...?)

94
00:04:18,033 --> 00:04:19,000
Cool.

95
00:04:19,100 --> 00:04:20,500
Great, this looks good.

96
00:04:20,900 --> 00:04:23,300
Well, we would usually start with here.

97
00:04:23,400 --> 00:04:25,367
- You have to get rid of the stalk.
- Normally.

98
00:04:26,867 --> 00:04:27,700
No way, it wouldn't work.

99
00:04:27,800 --> 00:04:29,633
Hold on, what was the sound you made?

100
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:33,967
It's itchy

101
00:04:34,067 --> 00:04:35,867
(keeping mosquitoes away)
Yeah, exactly

102
00:04:35,967 --> 00:04:38,567
I'll pick the fruits
and you'll keep the mosquitoes away.

103
00:04:38,767 --> 00:04:40,500
(Question/The awkwardness between you and Susu?)

104
00:04:40,600 --> 00:04:42,925
When Susu showed up on the
second day in that day's interview

105
00:04:42,949 --> 00:04:45,040
I went ahead and told him
it was awkward to see Susu.

106
00:04:45,345 --> 00:04:47,500
He was my least desired date.

107
00:04:48,067 --> 00:04:49,067
(The interview Susu gave back then)
Well, during that period

108
00:04:49,167 --> 00:04:50,433
during the Facebook era

109
00:04:50,533 --> 00:04:52,267
we chatted a few times

110
00:04:52,367 --> 00:04:53,800
I was somehow afraid

111
00:04:53,900 --> 00:04:55,833
since his attitude was still eager.

112
00:04:56,667 --> 00:04:57,433
So seven or eight years later

113
00:04:57,541 --> 00:04:59,208
it hasn't really been settled.

114
00:04:59,300 --> 00:04:59,933
When I met him again

115
00:05:00,033 --> 00:05:01,067
there was still a sense of

116
00:05:01,567 --> 00:05:02,867
awkwardness and fear.

117
00:05:02,967 --> 00:05:05,433
However, on the next day

118
00:05:05,533 --> 00:05:06,567
I told myself

119
00:05:06,667 --> 00:05:08,167
this was a great opportunity

120
00:05:08,267 --> 00:05:09,567
I was supposed

121
00:05:09,667 --> 00:05:10,467
to get to know Susu

122
00:05:10,567 --> 00:05:12,367
again by this chance

123
00:05:12,467 --> 00:05:14,533
since we both have gotten older.

124
00:05:14,900 --> 00:05:16,167
They are quite small.

125
00:05:16,267 --> 00:05:17,933
Not at all, they are quite big.

126
00:05:18,033 --> 00:05:20,233
Do you think picking guava is fun?

127
00:05:20,333 --> 00:05:21,933
- It is fine.
- My very first time picking guava.

128
00:05:22,033 --> 00:05:23,867
Me either, but the
mosquitoes are crazy here.

129
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:28,400
I'm someone who hates it

130
00:05:28,500 --> 00:05:30,800
when there is a knot inside me.

131
00:05:30,900 --> 00:05:31,800
So when this knot exists

132
00:05:31,900 --> 00:05:33,233
I want to talk it out.

133
00:05:33,333 --> 00:05:33,933
This is also why

134
00:05:34,033 --> 00:05:36,467
I've been saying that I'm interested
in him in the interview

135
00:05:36,567 --> 00:05:38,000
a couple of days ago

136
00:05:38,100 --> 00:05:40,000
I wanted to have more chats with him.

137
00:05:40,100 --> 00:05:41,800
This is one of the reasons

138
00:05:41,900 --> 00:05:43,100
why I always feel like

139
00:05:43,200 --> 00:05:45,000
there is a hurdle between us
that we can't get over

140
00:05:45,100 --> 00:05:46,900
which is not making me happy.

141
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:48,400
Whenever I see him
every time, it reminds me

142
00:05:48,500 --> 00:05:50,167
as if there is something

143
00:05:50,267 --> 00:05:52,133
that is unresolved between us.

144
00:05:52,233 --> 00:05:53,667
This feelings would come out.

145
00:05:53,767 --> 00:05:55,000
Well, I'm very glad

146
00:05:55,100 --> 00:05:57,833
that I get to go on a date with him.

147
00:05:58,033 --> 00:06:02,333
(Would Susu and Gino resolve
their issues through this date...?)

148
00:06:02,733 --> 00:06:05,967
(Orange Cafe)

149
00:06:08,133 --> 00:06:09,933
How about we share one drink together?

150
00:06:10,033 --> 00:06:11,300
Sure, what do you want?

151
00:06:11,400 --> 00:06:13,667
Your call, I'm fine either way.

152
00:06:14,382 --> 00:06:15,682
How about osmanthus with grapefruit

153
00:06:15,767 --> 00:06:16,433
(right when Eri and Bobo are ordering...)
Yeah.

154
00:06:16,533 --> 00:06:18,867
Well, we'll have an osmanthus cocktail.

155
00:06:19,533 --> 00:06:23,300
(Susu and Gino visit the Orange Cafe...)

156
00:06:24,933 --> 00:06:26,567
(Surprise)

157
00:06:26,667 --> 00:06:27,967
(exaggerating)
What's this? Filthy.

158
00:06:28,067 --> 00:06:30,433
We're ordering drinks, too

159
00:06:30,533 --> 00:06:33,200
I'm having an allergic reaction, see.

160
00:06:34,067 --> 00:06:36,667
Woah, look at this
So many mosquitoes bites.

161
00:06:36,767 --> 00:06:37,733
It's annoying.

162
00:06:37,833 --> 00:06:39,800
Do you know when you
get bitten by mosquitoes

163
00:06:39,900 --> 00:06:41,100
and how to stop the itchiness?

164
00:06:41,200 --> 00:06:42,133
You mean the cross method?

165
00:06:42,233 --> 00:06:43,467
Let me help you.

166
00:06:43,933 --> 00:06:44,967
You hear that? Cross method.

167
00:06:45,067 --> 00:06:48,600
An old trick thirty years ago
How old is he, huh?

168
00:06:48,700 --> 00:06:49,733
Stay still.

169
00:06:49,833 --> 00:06:50,833
A five-year-old kid.

170
00:06:50,933 --> 00:06:52,033
Done, the bite won't be itchy anymore.

171
00:06:52,133 --> 00:06:54,600
- Childish.
- It is still itchy, honestly.

172
00:06:54,700 --> 00:06:55,400
It's not working.

173
00:06:55,733 --> 00:06:57,433
(Showing off their trophies earlier)
Let me take a look.

174
00:06:58,200 --> 00:06:59,300
Does it taste good?

175
00:06:59,400 --> 00:07:00,433
I just ate one.

176
00:07:00,533 --> 00:07:01,600
- Yeah, we already ate one.
- Have one of these.

177
00:07:01,700 --> 00:07:02,433
- Yeah.
- That soon.

178
00:07:02,533 --> 00:07:04,033
We washed it right away and ate one.

179
00:07:04,133 --> 00:07:05,300
- We picked some veggies.
- Let's exchange.

180
00:07:05,400 --> 00:07:06,433
- Yeah.
- What should we exchange?

181
00:07:06,533 --> 00:07:07,600
An item for an item.

182
00:07:07,700 --> 00:07:08,767
- What do you guys want?
- Another one.

183
00:07:08,867 --> 00:07:09,667
One lettuce for me, please

184
00:07:09,767 --> 00:07:10,733
lettuce? Sure.

185
00:07:10,833 --> 00:07:12,767
- We will be sharing these with everyone later.
- The veggies are all organic.

186
00:07:12,867 --> 00:07:14,100
- Yeah.
- Tell you something.

187
00:07:14,200 --> 00:07:15,967
Take it... and take one bite.

188
00:07:16,067 --> 00:07:17,033
Eat...

189
00:07:17,133 --> 00:07:19,267
(troubled expression)

190
00:07:19,367 --> 00:07:21,233
What on earth exactly?

191
00:07:22,200 --> 00:07:23,533
Nice.

192
00:07:23,967 --> 00:07:25,833
He'll turn around to puke.

193
00:07:25,900 --> 00:07:31,167
(There is always laughter with Eri's presence...)

194
00:07:42,600 --> 00:07:43,867
(Enjoying the drinks at the site)

195
00:07:43,967 --> 00:07:45,100
There it is. The flavor on the second sip.

196
00:07:45,200 --> 00:07:47,033
The taste of alcohol.

197
00:07:47,133 --> 00:07:49,200
The taste of happiness on the second sip.

198
00:07:49,900 --> 00:07:51,633
There it is, right?

199
00:07:52,333 --> 00:07:53,500
Exactly what I needed.

200
00:07:53,600 --> 00:07:54,500
That's right.

201
00:07:55,033 --> 00:07:58,000
So we're heading to this giant bird

202
00:07:58,100 --> 00:07:59,567
to have a heart-to-heart conversation.

203
00:08:02,333 --> 00:08:03,467
Alright.

204
00:08:07,300 --> 00:08:08,800
Can you sing "Love me, don't go"?

205
00:08:09,300 --> 00:08:11,167
We are singing that?

206
00:08:11,567 --> 00:08:12,800
- Yeah, absolutely.
- How about

207
00:08:12,900 --> 00:08:14,500
let's sing "Intimate Lover".

208
00:08:14,600 --> 00:08:15,500
- Alright.
- Since I feel like

209
00:08:15,600 --> 00:08:18,500
we are even closer than some lovers.

210
00:08:18,600 --> 00:08:20,100
Right?

211
00:08:21,733 --> 00:08:28,467
The wind is still blowing
and I remember how gentle you are.

212
00:08:28,567 --> 00:08:33,467
Days with you are exceptionally carefree.

213
00:08:39,333 --> 00:08:40,467
I think I'm so lucky

214
00:08:40,567 --> 00:08:43,200
to save a little brother.

215
00:08:43,300 --> 00:08:46,000
Yeah, but...

216
00:08:46,100 --> 00:08:49,167
sometimes I would feel like

217
00:08:50,300 --> 00:08:51,567
sometimes there is this feeling

218
00:08:51,667 --> 00:08:52,567
that I'm going through a tough time

219
00:08:52,667 --> 00:08:54,467
but I have no idea what's so tough about.

220
00:08:54,543 --> 00:08:58,009
It seems that I couldn't reach out

221
00:08:58,133 --> 00:09:00,957
I couldn't find a chance to reach out.
to find someone to save me, yeah.

222
00:09:00,982 --> 00:09:03,343
(Eri, who takes great care of everyone,
also needs to a listener and protector)

223
00:09:05,175 --> 00:09:06,142
I'm here with you

224
00:09:06,167 --> 00:09:09,800
and you still can't be saved by me?

225
00:09:09,900 --> 00:09:11,267
It's not about being there

226
00:09:11,367 --> 00:09:13,067
I know a lot of people
will be there for me.

227
00:09:13,167 --> 00:09:14,433
It's just...

228
00:09:14,967 --> 00:09:18,633
I haven't found an outlet

229
00:09:18,733 --> 00:09:21,700
to reach out towards.

230
00:09:21,800 --> 00:09:26,667
So I feel like sometimes
it's a little rough for me.

231
00:09:26,767 --> 00:09:28,967
The truth is, I'm aware Bobo
has no way of helping me

232
00:09:29,067 --> 00:09:30,967
but at least he is a great listener.

233
00:09:31,067 --> 00:09:32,800
(Question/Why did you cry during the date?)
Well, I'm not sure myself

234
00:09:32,900 --> 00:09:35,733
how to fix this problem.

235
00:09:36,900 --> 00:09:39,567
That's how it is for the time being.

236
00:09:39,929 --> 00:09:43,232
It's not because of you and
it's not because of NIO.

237
00:09:43,257 --> 00:09:45,178
(Eri is trying to understand his emotions)

238
00:09:45,433 --> 00:09:47,900
It's my own issue.

239
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:49,767
During these couple of days

240
00:09:50,415 --> 00:09:53,282
hanging out with every one of you

241
00:09:53,367 --> 00:09:54,767
this is a result worth cheering for.

242
00:09:54,867 --> 00:09:58,500
At least I know it's a food for thought

243
00:09:59,167 --> 00:10:01,433
I've never thought about that before.

244
00:10:01,867 --> 00:10:03,767
That's it.

245
00:10:03,867 --> 00:10:05,667
- What?
- Good luck.

246
00:10:05,767 --> 00:10:06,333
What?

247
00:10:06,433 --> 00:10:07,433
Personally, even if Bobo

248
00:10:07,533 --> 00:10:09,133
wants to reach out his hand

249
00:10:09,233 --> 00:10:10,533
I haven't found an outlet for him.

250
00:10:10,633 --> 00:10:13,433
It's impossible for him
to get inside and reach me

251
00:10:13,533 --> 00:10:15,700
finding where I am.

252
00:10:15,800 --> 00:10:19,767
Everything needs a perfect time and place

253
00:10:19,867 --> 00:10:21,933
to meet the right people

254
00:10:22,033 --> 00:10:22,933
the right thing.

255
00:10:34,833 --> 00:10:37,233
Guess this is the song of the day.

256
00:10:46,833 --> 00:10:51,067
Well, today I'm feeling less emotional

257
00:10:51,167 --> 00:10:52,133
something like that.

258
00:10:52,233 --> 00:10:54,900
It's not because I'm upset or in the mood.

259
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:56,533
It's just...

260
00:10:57,167 --> 00:10:58,933
some silence would be
appreciated sometimes.

261
00:10:59,033 --> 00:11:01,100
The last couple of days, I was quite...

262
00:11:03,333 --> 00:11:04,500
Outgoing.

263
00:11:05,200 --> 00:11:08,200
(Even in close interactions, it's
important to find moments to calm down...)

264
00:11:08,300 --> 00:11:11,367
A little quietness. Giving myself some time

265
00:11:11,467 --> 00:11:13,367
I think it's nice.

266
00:11:13,467 --> 00:11:16,500
Yeah, quite comfortable actually.

267
00:11:17,467 --> 00:11:18,567
Let's go.

268
00:11:18,733 --> 00:11:19,867
Let's go.

269
00:11:22,133 --> 00:11:22,800
So what?

270
00:11:22,900 --> 00:11:24,833
It's rare I would share
something like this?

271
00:11:25,233 --> 00:11:27,500
Not at all, don't we share everything?

272
00:11:33,033 --> 00:11:34,533
The decoration looks great.

273
00:11:34,633 --> 00:11:36,167
Let's take some pics.

274
00:11:36,267 --> 00:11:37,467
You love desserts?

275
00:11:37,567 --> 00:11:38,500
Super, I'm crazy about desserts.

276
00:11:38,600 --> 00:11:41,678
(Susu and Gino stay at Orange Cafe) Is it
because you would feel great after eating it?

277
00:11:41,767 --> 00:11:42,900
Yeah, another reason is that

278
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:44,367
I love eating delicious food.

279
00:11:44,467 --> 00:11:45,733
Generally, desserts

280
00:11:45,833 --> 00:11:47,300
well, personally.

281
00:11:47,400 --> 00:11:48,633
It's easy to find a good dessert.

282
00:11:48,733 --> 00:11:50,500
Hard to find a bad one.

283
00:11:50,600 --> 00:11:51,567
Well, it's not that hard to find a bad one

284
00:11:51,667 --> 00:11:52,400
I'll put it this way.

285
00:11:52,500 --> 00:11:54,067
It's easy to find a tasty one.

286
00:11:54,167 --> 00:11:57,033
When you walk into a store

287
00:11:57,133 --> 00:11:58,267
at least there is something to order.

288
00:11:58,367 --> 00:11:59,700
Something like that, yeah.

289
00:11:59,800 --> 00:12:00,567
(Casually chatting about desserts,
they haven't discussed their past yet)

290
00:12:00,667 --> 00:12:01,633
Go ahead.

291
00:12:01,733 --> 00:12:02,500
Right.

292
00:12:02,600 --> 00:12:03,867
Then I'll have this first.

293
00:12:03,967 --> 00:12:04,600
Sure.

294
00:12:08,300 --> 00:12:09,133
The thing is.

295
00:12:09,233 --> 00:12:10,033
Let's jump to this topic.

296
00:12:10,133 --> 00:12:11,067
- Okay.
- At first sight

297
00:12:11,167 --> 00:12:11,800
I wanted to touch on this.

298
00:12:11,900 --> 00:12:13,300
When I saw you on the show

299
00:12:13,400 --> 00:12:14,300
to be honest.

300
00:12:15,200 --> 00:12:17,000
"Long time no see, but I'm screwed."

301
00:12:17,100 --> 00:12:18,433
What exactly happened between us?

302
00:12:18,533 --> 00:12:19,700
I sensed the awkwardness.

303
00:12:20,067 --> 00:12:22,167
(Gino took the lead to bring up the past)
Then we talked briefly

304
00:12:22,267 --> 00:12:24,333
I had zero clue what happened.

305
00:12:24,433 --> 00:12:26,533
- Anyway, this is...
- Very delicate.

306
00:12:26,633 --> 00:12:28,000
Yeah, amidst this awkwardness.

307
00:12:28,100 --> 00:12:29,500
So far, the situation would be

308
00:12:29,600 --> 00:12:31,333
we met before this show

309
00:12:31,433 --> 00:12:32,967
but nothing really happened.

310
00:12:33,067 --> 00:12:33,633
You know?

311
00:12:33,733 --> 00:12:35,400
We just went out and had a meal

312
00:12:35,500 --> 00:12:37,300
but on the Internet...

313
00:12:37,400 --> 00:12:39,733
We did keep in touch with
each other on the Internet

314
00:12:39,833 --> 00:12:42,033
but it was...

315
00:12:42,133 --> 00:12:43,133
We didn't know what to talk about

316
00:12:43,233 --> 00:12:44,267
- and...
- And that was it.

317
00:12:44,367 --> 00:12:45,567
Yeah, then we stopped talking.

318
00:12:48,033 --> 00:12:49,433
I'm glad that Susu

319
00:12:49,533 --> 00:12:52,833
during the brief conversation

320
00:12:52,933 --> 00:12:54,633
we have already untangled

321
00:12:54,733 --> 00:12:59,700
some of the issues we had before.

322
00:13:00,067 --> 00:13:01,710
(Breaking the ice from the past, the
two talk about their current feelings...)

323
00:13:01,735 --> 00:13:03,110
What about you? How are
you during those five days?

324
00:13:03,967 --> 00:13:04,767
The truth is

325
00:13:04,867 --> 00:13:07,267
on the very first day

326
00:13:07,367 --> 00:13:09,100
I have a crush on Guan-Yu.

327
00:13:09,200 --> 00:13:10,333
In the beginning, you chose

328
00:13:10,433 --> 00:13:12,567
you already chose Guan-Yu?

329
00:13:12,667 --> 00:13:14,133
There was this day

330
00:13:14,233 --> 00:13:15,800
I was put in an awkward position.

331
00:13:15,900 --> 00:13:16,567
How's so?

332
00:13:16,867 --> 00:13:18,200
(Gino was once very bothered
by Susu and Guan-Yu's interaction)

333
00:13:18,300 --> 00:13:20,533
Based on my personality I
don't want to bother other people.

334
00:13:20,633 --> 00:13:22,767
Well, if something good is going on, great

335
00:13:22,867 --> 00:13:24,933
but I'd feel awkward about it

336
00:13:25,033 --> 00:13:26,933
I couldn't sleep because of this.

337
00:13:27,033 --> 00:13:27,567
Couldn't sleep?

338
00:13:27,667 --> 00:13:28,933
Yeah, there was this concern

339
00:13:29,033 --> 00:13:31,067
of how I should handle this

340
00:13:31,167 --> 00:13:34,467
feeling that I had at the moment.

341
00:13:34,567 --> 00:13:36,233
You know, the whole picture is that

342
00:13:37,133 --> 00:13:38,533
everything about him

343
00:13:38,633 --> 00:13:41,133
checks every box of my ideal partner.

344
00:13:41,233 --> 00:13:43,267
What I meant by an ideal partner is

345
00:13:43,600 --> 00:13:45,233
a general idea.

346
00:13:46,433 --> 00:13:47,233
In terms of appearance

347
00:13:47,333 --> 00:13:48,867
I like someone who's cute

348
00:13:48,967 --> 00:13:52,300
with short hair and a fit body.

349
00:13:52,400 --> 00:13:53,300
(Susu was once very
interested in Guan-Yu...)

350
00:13:53,400 --> 00:13:56,600
In terms of personality, I
like someone who is innocent.

351
00:13:56,700 --> 00:13:57,467
Besides

352
00:13:57,567 --> 00:14:00,800
he is the most pure person among us eight.

353
00:14:00,900 --> 00:14:01,433
Yeah, well.

354
00:14:01,533 --> 00:14:04,067
May I ask something?

355
00:14:04,167 --> 00:14:05,467
In this situation.

356
00:14:05,567 --> 00:14:06,167
What?

357
00:14:06,267 --> 00:14:07,700
Well, in the latter stage.

358
00:14:07,800 --> 00:14:10,767
- Guan-Yu and I are still going strong.
- I'm aware.

359
00:14:10,867 --> 00:14:12,633
Fate is something I couldn't ask for.

360
00:14:12,733 --> 00:14:14,067
So personally

361
00:14:14,167 --> 00:14:15,900
if the opportunity presents himself

362
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:17,667
apparently, it would be great.

363
00:14:17,767 --> 00:14:18,533
If the opportunity is not mine

364
00:14:18,633 --> 00:14:20,067
I'm fine with it.

365
00:14:20,167 --> 00:14:21,233
At least I met a bunch of people

366
00:14:21,333 --> 00:14:23,933
a bunch of great friends.

367
00:14:24,600 --> 00:14:25,967
Awkwardness was there at first

368
00:14:26,067 --> 00:14:27,400
but we ended up talking about a lot of things

369
00:14:27,500 --> 00:14:29,333
happened in these five days.

370
00:14:29,800 --> 00:14:31,300
I guess the knot was untangled.

371
00:14:31,400 --> 00:14:35,267
It made me way more comfortable.

372
00:14:35,833 --> 00:14:37,933
Intriguing that he wants to do everything

373
00:14:38,033 --> 00:14:40,967
(still talking about Guan-Yu)
but he wants it all.

374
00:14:41,067 --> 00:14:41,967
He makes me realize

375
00:14:42,067 --> 00:14:43,867
he's given himself too much pressure.

376
00:14:43,967 --> 00:14:45,500
If I'm in your position.

377
00:14:45,600 --> 00:14:48,051
(Gino explains his problems with
Guan-Yu and asks for his advice)

378
00:14:48,076 --> 00:14:50,867
I'd guide him step by step and
let him accomplish his goals.

379
00:14:51,733 --> 00:14:52,600
Not blessings, though.

380
00:14:52,700 --> 00:14:54,367
At least it wouldn't be my intention

381
00:14:54,467 --> 00:14:57,733
to interfere with what's going on
between them now.

382
00:14:57,833 --> 00:14:59,367
However, if they need my advice

383
00:14:59,467 --> 00:15:01,133
I could give it to them.

384
00:15:01,233 --> 00:15:03,767
If they really become a couple

385
00:15:03,867 --> 00:15:05,033
naturally and logically

386
00:15:05,148 --> 00:15:07,048
I could be an onlooker.

387
00:15:16,733 --> 00:15:18,333
(Members gather at Orange Cafe
after the dates) Come on, Kirin.

388
00:15:18,433 --> 00:15:19,567
Kirin.

389
00:15:19,667 --> 00:15:21,867
Kirin seems like an option for lots...

390
00:15:21,967 --> 00:15:22,833
Everyone, grab one.

391
00:15:22,933 --> 00:15:23,933
Thanks.

392
00:15:24,033 --> 00:15:26,067
- He's almost out.
- You're reaching your limit, aren't you?

393
00:15:26,167 --> 00:15:27,733
Here I come, the fountain of life.

394
00:15:27,833 --> 00:15:28,433
Cheers.

395
00:15:28,533 --> 00:15:30,300
Cheers.

396
00:15:30,967 --> 00:15:31,500
No clinking sound yet.

397
00:15:31,600 --> 00:15:32,467
Nice to meet you guys.

398
00:15:32,567 --> 00:15:33,767
No eye contact.

399
00:15:34,600 --> 00:15:35,767
Why?

400
00:15:35,867 --> 00:15:39,100
Seven years of bad sex.

401
00:15:39,168 --> 00:15:40,501
- Oh really.
- If you do cheers without eye contacts.

402
00:15:40,633 --> 00:15:42,167
- Seriously.
- Yeah.

403
00:15:42,267 --> 00:15:44,433
Where is this tale from?

404
00:15:44,533 --> 00:15:45,933
(NIO is sharing his hometown's custom...)
- England - Okay, cool

405
00:15:46,033 --> 00:15:47,800
(staring passionately)
Alright, longer eye contact

406
00:15:47,900 --> 00:15:48,833
I don't want that seven years.

407
00:15:48,933 --> 00:15:50,633
- Well, this is...
- Okay, cool

408
00:15:50,733 --> 00:15:52,400
scarier than the God of Wealth.

409
00:15:52,500 --> 00:15:55,767
Terrifying, I don't want
bad sex for seven years.

410
00:15:55,867 --> 00:15:58,067
Cheers.

411
00:15:59,200 --> 00:16:02,267
Eye contact.

412
00:16:04,867 --> 00:16:06,333
Gino.

413
00:16:06,433 --> 00:16:08,533
(Finally, the moment of
alcohol liberation has arrived!)

414
00:16:08,633 --> 00:16:09,700
Well, well well.

415
00:16:28,600 --> 00:16:34,867
(Under the influence of alcohol, the members
welcome the final night with excitement)

416
00:16:35,533 --> 00:16:38,600
(Double Tent: Shih-Fung, Susu)

417
00:16:39,867 --> 00:16:41,200
Up for a chit-chat?

418
00:16:41,300 --> 00:16:42,900
Sure, why not?

419
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:44,200
Nothing, I just...

420
00:16:44,300 --> 00:16:45,800
I've been wanting to ask you.

421
00:16:45,900 --> 00:16:47,500
- Earlier.
- Cramps.

422
00:16:47,600 --> 00:16:49,200
Earlier when we were together

423
00:16:49,300 --> 00:16:49,833
after all

424
00:16:49,933 --> 00:16:51,900
you know it's our first time
drinking and letting loose

425
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:53,567
did you see anything special?

426
00:16:53,667 --> 00:16:56,100
Because I've noticed a lot of things

427
00:16:56,200 --> 00:16:57,467
I wasn't completely certain

428
00:16:57,567 --> 00:16:59,000
with the help of alcohol

429
00:16:59,100 --> 00:17:00,167
I can make sure.

430
00:17:00,267 --> 00:17:01,533
(Observant Shi-Fung seems
to have noticed something...?)

431
00:17:01,633 --> 00:17:04,233
You know, everyone tends to loosen up.

432
00:17:06,067 --> 00:17:07,900
Did you see something new?

433
00:17:09,133 --> 00:17:10,933
I didn't, it was pretty much the same.

434
00:17:11,300 --> 00:17:12,967
(Susu seems to have something unsaid...)

435
00:17:13,067 --> 00:17:15,967
What about you?
What is the situation of yours?

436
00:17:16,600 --> 00:17:17,767
Moving on

437
00:17:18,067 --> 00:17:20,900
if the opportunity presents itself, great

438
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:23,133
if not, then talk to you later.

439
00:17:23,233 --> 00:17:25,100
For this time being

440
00:17:25,200 --> 00:17:26,333
I'm in a situation where

441
00:17:26,433 --> 00:17:27,500
moving forward, I wish

442
00:17:27,600 --> 00:17:30,367
to hang out with everyone.

443
00:17:30,659 --> 00:17:32,859
(Double Tent: Gino, Guan-Yu)

444
00:17:32,967 --> 00:17:35,267
Alright, are you really just
3 out of 10 drunk right now?

445
00:17:35,367 --> 00:17:36,967
Be honest with me.

446
00:17:39,967 --> 00:17:40,667
I will cooperate.

447
00:17:40,767 --> 00:17:41,300
You can tell me the truth.

448
00:17:41,400 --> 00:17:44,033
Are you guys tipsy?

449
00:17:44,133 --> 00:17:45,567
I am not.

450
00:17:45,667 --> 00:17:47,867
Why not? And why is that?

451
00:17:47,967 --> 00:17:49,600
So how about a toast?

452
00:17:49,700 --> 00:17:50,367
That being said...

453
00:17:50,467 --> 00:17:52,154
(Guan-Yu's evening drink seems
to have gotten him a little tipsy...)

454
00:17:52,179 --> 00:17:54,833
- Eye contact, people.
- Glad to know you.

455
00:17:54,933 --> 00:17:55,767
Pleasant to know you.

456
00:17:55,867 --> 00:17:57,700
Wait, hold on

457
00:17:57,800 --> 00:17:59,833
I'm glad you've found yourself.

458
00:18:00,133 --> 00:18:01,633
Well, I feel like I need some practice.

459
00:18:01,733 --> 00:18:04,000
Besides, this is not a
dangerous environment.

460
00:18:04,100 --> 00:18:04,833
No, no.

461
00:18:04,933 --> 00:18:06,400
- The production crew is here.
- No, no...

462
00:18:06,500 --> 00:18:08,733
I gotta say, tipsy is nice

463
00:18:08,833 --> 00:18:10,467
I'm not gonna have more drinks

464
00:18:10,567 --> 00:18:13,700
I mean you have to remember
to drink more water

465
00:18:13,800 --> 00:18:16,633
and remind yourself to be more sober.

466
00:18:16,733 --> 00:18:17,767
Tipsy isn't bad

467
00:18:17,867 --> 00:18:20,467
I bet we'll drink more later during dinner.

468
00:18:20,567 --> 00:18:22,433
Definitely, yeah

469
00:18:32,200 --> 00:18:32,867
(closing the gap suddenly)

470
00:18:32,967 --> 00:18:33,833
What are you watching?

471
00:18:33,933 --> 00:18:36,367
I'm watching a Korean variety show.

472
00:18:36,867 --> 00:18:39,933
Staring at the phone forever

473
00:18:40,033 --> 00:18:41,233
(sitting down)

474
00:18:43,900 --> 00:18:47,400
I just want to say, hang in there.

475
00:18:49,067 --> 00:18:51,133
I think that.

476
00:18:52,333 --> 00:18:54,267
(As first-time roommates,
you work too hard

477
00:18:54,367 --> 00:18:56,100
they became more relaxed after
having a drink together) I'm alright.

478
00:18:56,900 --> 00:18:58,133
What I mean is

479
00:18:59,533 --> 00:19:01,800
there are so many
things you want to achieve

480
00:19:02,733 --> 00:19:05,067
so many things you want to do.

481
00:19:05,667 --> 00:19:08,733
There is only so much time.

482
00:19:09,500 --> 00:19:11,767
To be frank

483
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:14,367
even if we are dating

484
00:19:14,467 --> 00:19:17,600
when you can't take great care of yourself

485
00:19:17,700 --> 00:19:20,767
there is no point in
getting back to society

486
00:19:20,874 --> 00:19:22,607
without putting yourself first.

487
00:19:22,700 --> 00:19:24,700
(Gino, after a few drinks,
seems to have opened up...)

488
00:19:24,725 --> 00:19:28,333
- But I feel like I do take care of myself.
- What I'm saying is that, be a happy person.

489
00:19:31,590 --> 00:19:34,090
After we got back and rested in the tent

490
00:19:34,115 --> 00:19:38,482
we talked about thoughts
of the show being over.

491
00:19:38,567 --> 00:19:40,200
During the process

492
00:19:40,300 --> 00:19:42,600
the air was somehow tense

493
00:19:42,700 --> 00:19:44,933
I still have some concerns over

494
00:19:45,033 --> 00:19:48,100
long distance relationships.

495
00:19:48,200 --> 00:19:49,600
On top of that

496
00:19:49,700 --> 00:19:51,700
the difference in our beliefs

497
00:19:51,800 --> 00:19:53,567
is worrying me a little.

498
00:19:53,667 --> 00:19:55,867
But still, I have to say

499
00:19:55,967 --> 00:19:58,533
I would love to give it a try.

500
00:19:59,233 --> 00:20:01,333
Good luck.

501
00:20:02,300 --> 00:20:05,200
Those six days are just a different...

502
00:20:05,300 --> 00:20:07,633
I know you wouldn't like me.

503
00:20:10,100 --> 00:20:13,000
I like you, I do like you.

504
00:20:13,100 --> 00:20:16,067
It's just there are lots of...

505
00:20:16,167 --> 00:20:18,900
- I know.
- Challenges to overcome.

506
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:22,008
(There are huge differences between their
ideas and beliefs) Don't worry about me.

507
00:20:22,220 --> 00:20:24,387
God it, don't worry about me.

508
00:20:24,933 --> 00:20:27,400
Well, alright, just get some sleep.

509
00:20:28,133 --> 00:20:30,000
So freaking cute.

510
00:20:33,200 --> 00:20:35,567
What? I didn't do anything to you.

511
00:20:35,667 --> 00:20:38,233
Like I kept complaining to you.

512
00:20:38,333 --> 00:20:39,700
(The cozy vibe in the tent fades with the conversation...)

513
00:20:39,800 --> 00:20:41,567
Alright, yes, I worried about you.

514
00:20:41,667 --> 00:20:43,233
Don't worry.

515
00:20:44,100 --> 00:20:48,800
(Eri is walking toward...?)

516
00:20:48,900 --> 00:20:49,967
What are you up to?

517
00:20:50,067 --> 00:20:51,633
(Double Tent:Bobo, NIO)

518
00:20:51,733 --> 00:20:53,367
Hi, I'm enjoying the AC.

519
00:20:53,467 --> 00:20:54,067
Can I come in?

520
00:20:54,167 --> 00:20:54,833
Sure, come on in

521
00:20:54,933 --> 00:20:57,267
I'd like a hug from you.

522
00:20:57,367 --> 00:20:58,400
Absolutely

523
00:20:58,500 --> 00:21:00,067
I gotta close the curtains once you're in.

524
00:21:00,167 --> 00:21:02,900
Hold on, because...

525
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:06,233
(Eri asks for a hug from NIO...)
I gotta close it. Mosquitoes are terrifying to me.

526
00:21:06,333 --> 00:21:07,533
Can the camera see us?

527
00:21:07,633 --> 00:21:08,233
Yes.

528
00:21:08,333 --> 00:21:10,267
Where is the blind spot?

529
00:21:10,367 --> 00:21:11,033
This is embarrassing.

530
00:21:11,133 --> 00:21:12,500
The camera isn't working here.

531
00:21:12,600 --> 00:21:13,367
Okay.

532
00:21:14,567 --> 00:21:15,267
Sorry.

533
00:21:15,367 --> 00:21:16,300
(They move to a place where
cameras can't film) No, not at all

534
00:21:16,400 --> 00:21:18,333
I know my attitude toward you

535
00:21:18,433 --> 00:21:19,500
have changed completely

536
00:21:19,600 --> 00:21:22,400
I've noticed that and I won't take it to heart

537
00:21:22,500 --> 00:21:23,600
because...

538
00:21:23,700 --> 00:21:24,800
Because I get it

539
00:21:24,900 --> 00:21:26,700
- I just think I need more time.
- That feeling.

540
00:21:26,800 --> 00:21:28,200
(Eri and NIO talk about their feelings...)
- Yeah - I need a little bit more time

541
00:21:28,300 --> 00:21:29,767
I know.

542
00:21:30,300 --> 00:21:32,700
I feel like I still need

543
00:21:32,800 --> 00:21:34,800
some of my own space.

544
00:21:34,900 --> 00:21:38,000
It's possible that he
just wants to cheer me up

545
00:21:38,100 --> 00:21:40,267
or does he understand
what I'm going through.

546
00:21:40,367 --> 00:21:41,533
However, when I finish talking

547
00:21:41,633 --> 00:21:43,867
I'd just gradually disappear.

548
00:21:43,967 --> 00:21:45,200
That's why I told him I just needed

549
00:21:45,300 --> 00:21:46,900
some of my own space.

550
00:21:47,067 --> 00:21:48,900
(Question/What did you talk about
with Eri?) I think he is very mature.

551
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:52,700
Well, guess we opened up
and talked about quite a few things.

552
00:21:52,800 --> 00:21:55,633
Judging from the current position

553
00:21:55,733 --> 00:21:57,333
we've had good understanding of each other.

554
00:21:57,867 --> 00:21:59,500
Alright, let me put it this way.

555
00:21:59,600 --> 00:22:01,667
In terms of the extent to which I like you...

556
00:22:01,767 --> 00:22:02,967
Probably 90%.

557
00:22:03,067 --> 00:22:06,467
But I feel that the extent
to which we're not suitable is 100.

558
00:22:07,233 --> 00:22:07,967
How is that?

559
00:22:08,067 --> 00:22:09,500
You might get what I'm saying now

560
00:22:09,600 --> 00:22:11,733
I don't think I'm good enough.

561
00:22:11,833 --> 00:22:13,933
Do you know who said the same thing?

562
00:22:14,033 --> 00:22:14,800
Who?

563
00:22:15,633 --> 00:22:18,467
Tell me.

564
00:22:18,833 --> 00:22:19,500
(Eri thinks he isn't good enough
while someone has said the same thing...)

565
00:22:19,600 --> 00:22:22,033
- I think I...
- Anyway, one person among us.

566
00:22:22,133 --> 00:22:24,833
He has said the same thing I said.

567
00:22:27,167 --> 00:22:28,333
You're far too good.

568
00:22:28,433 --> 00:22:29,800
(On the fourth night)
it makes me feel.

569
00:22:30,867 --> 00:22:33,167
I'm so far away from you.

570
00:22:34,267 --> 00:22:37,100
Sometimes, it scares me a little.

571
00:22:37,200 --> 00:22:39,567
Like I will never be good enough.

572
00:22:39,933 --> 00:22:40,667
Sounds like...

573
00:22:40,767 --> 00:22:41,967
Are you serious?

574
00:22:42,300 --> 00:22:44,467
Like, you know everything.

575
00:22:45,067 --> 00:22:46,467
(NIO's excellence, has made others hesitate)
We might not be suitable together.

576
00:22:46,567 --> 00:22:48,167
In my opinion.

577
00:22:50,033 --> 00:22:51,600
Look, your life.

578
00:22:52,100 --> 00:22:54,000
You know, your bars and your nightlife.

579
00:22:54,100 --> 00:22:56,100
How could you give that up?

580
00:22:56,933 --> 00:22:59,333
I mean, how could you give up on that?

581
00:22:59,433 --> 00:23:00,100
Yeah

582
00:23:00,200 --> 00:23:01,700
I prefer the stability.

583
00:23:05,051 --> 00:23:06,851
But he said he liked you.

584
00:23:08,733 --> 00:23:10,667
But he said he was scared

585
00:23:10,767 --> 00:23:11,533
I'm not scared at all.

586
00:23:11,633 --> 00:23:14,733
(While they are opening up, Bobo returns
to the tent...) I just think we won't work.

587
00:23:17,433 --> 00:23:19,500
We have to keep a distance

588
00:23:19,600 --> 00:23:23,033
(getting up)
I've already decided not to get too close to you

589
00:23:23,133 --> 00:23:25,400
after I gave the present yesterday.

590
00:23:25,500 --> 00:23:27,000
Let me rephrase it

591
00:23:27,100 --> 00:23:31,833
(sneaking around)(spooked)
Don't touch it.

592
00:23:31,933 --> 00:23:33,600
(Bobo was trying to adjust the camera... Mission failed)
Very important, so I'll repeat myself.

593
00:23:33,700 --> 00:23:34,600
What are you doing?

594
00:23:34,700 --> 00:23:36,000
Trying to film us?

595
00:23:36,100 --> 00:23:36,833
The show wouldn't be as interesting.

596
00:23:36,933 --> 00:23:37,867
How mean you are.

597
00:23:37,967 --> 00:23:39,167
No way, nope.

598
00:23:39,500 --> 00:23:41,833
(Bobo is out of focus)
For a lot of times in my life

599
00:23:41,933 --> 00:23:44,133
I've heard people say that to me.

600
00:23:44,233 --> 00:23:46,933
Of course, I'm a little upset.

601
00:23:47,033 --> 00:23:49,000
(Will their relationship change after
this heart-to-heart conversation?)

602
00:23:49,114 --> 00:23:51,914
It's like I've done something wrong. But I
hope I don't have to be so far away from you.

603
00:24:02,167 --> 00:24:04,633
(Let's barbecue on the
final night of this journey!)

604
00:24:04,733 --> 00:24:06,233
Somewhat somber.

605
00:24:06,567 --> 00:24:09,400
- Tell you, it's barbecue.
- It's barbecue.

606
00:24:09,800 --> 00:24:11,833
Our last day.

607
00:24:11,933 --> 00:24:14,067
- A little.
- A little upset

608
00:24:14,167 --> 00:24:16,067
I saw the star of the show.

609
00:24:16,167 --> 00:24:17,667
Booze?

610
00:24:17,767 --> 00:24:19,267
Oh my gosh.

611
00:24:19,367 --> 00:24:20,500
(Some adult drinks are involved, apparently...)
My fountain of life.

612
00:24:20,600 --> 00:24:21,867
It's our last day.

613
00:24:21,967 --> 00:24:22,600
Let's get moving.

614
00:24:22,700 --> 00:24:24,133
- Get moving.
- Chop, chop, shall we?

615
00:24:24,233 --> 00:24:26,267
Don't force me to give
out commands, alright?

616
00:24:28,700 --> 00:24:32,200
(It's been a while since
they gathered for dinner...)

617
00:24:32,300 --> 00:24:34,033
- Seriously?
- Handsome.

618
00:24:34,133 --> 00:24:35,367
Time to take off the clothes.

619
00:24:36,500 --> 00:24:38,300
Pull down the pants.

620
00:24:38,400 --> 00:24:39,600
Not a great look.

621
00:24:40,167 --> 00:24:41,900
The food won't stick on the pan.

622
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:43,833
- That's awesome.
- Indeed

623
00:24:43,933 --> 00:24:45,100
I'll leave you to it.

624
00:24:45,200 --> 00:24:46,900
You opened the booze?

625
00:24:47,000 --> 00:24:48,467
He did and he already poured it out.

626
00:24:48,567 --> 00:24:49,733
Incredible.

627
00:24:52,300 --> 00:24:55,500
(Now, people got much more
relaxed than the first day...)

628
00:24:56,067 --> 00:24:57,900
NIO, what took you so long?

629
00:24:58,000 --> 00:24:59,233
Thanks.

630
00:25:04,233 --> 00:25:05,400
Worth standing up for this.

631
00:25:05,500 --> 00:25:09,000
(Toast to this night!)

632
00:25:17,567 --> 00:25:18,833
Drizzle here and there.

633
00:25:18,933 --> 00:25:20,233
It'll be salty.

634
00:25:20,767 --> 00:25:21,600
I like it.

635
00:25:21,700 --> 00:25:22,467
Incredible.

636
00:25:22,567 --> 00:25:23,467
- Alright.
- Is it done?

637
00:25:23,567 --> 00:25:24,433
I'm digging in then.

638
00:25:26,782 --> 00:25:31,115
(Seizing every moment to hang out...)

639
00:25:32,167 --> 00:25:33,767
- Hi.
- Hello.

640
00:25:34,167 --> 00:25:35,400
There is out ninth guest.

641
00:25:35,500 --> 00:25:37,033
(Another mysterious new member?!)
- I thought Abao is here

642
00:25:37,133 --> 00:25:38,533
Adorable.

643
00:25:42,900 --> 00:25:44,733
It's adorable

644
00:25:44,833 --> 00:25:46,700
I miss my cat so much.

645
00:25:47,667 --> 00:25:50,667
(The ninth member left gracefully...)

646
00:25:51,167 --> 00:25:52,800
This is our last night.

647
00:25:52,900 --> 00:25:56,900
Is there anyone wishing to say something?

648
00:25:57,000 --> 00:25:59,067
So there won't be regrets and remorse?

649
00:25:59,167 --> 00:26:00,067
Can I ask something?

650
00:26:00,167 --> 00:26:02,700
Do people want to say something

651
00:26:02,800 --> 00:26:04,567
to each of their crush?

652
00:26:04,667 --> 00:26:05,633
Leave out the names.

653
00:26:05,733 --> 00:26:07,167
- Is that alright?
- Absolutely.

654
00:26:07,267 --> 00:26:08,233
Yeah, I like the sound of it.

655
00:26:08,333 --> 00:26:10,533
(Jia-Hang proposed that everyone should.
- I think it's fine - Amazing idea

656
00:26:10,633 --> 00:26:11,067
say something to their anonymous crush)
Fun.

657
00:26:11,167 --> 00:26:12,533
- Who wants to go first?
- Starting from you.

658
00:26:12,633 --> 00:26:14,100
Starting from me.

659
00:26:14,767 --> 00:26:16,600
I want to say to my crush

660
00:26:16,700 --> 00:26:19,600
that I hope there will be
more room to grow between us.

661
00:26:19,700 --> 00:26:23,100
And I really like you, admire you.

662
00:26:23,433 --> 00:26:24,267
And...

663
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:26,367
inside my mind

664
00:26:26,767 --> 00:26:29,633
your scores have already reached here

665
00:26:29,733 --> 00:26:30,200
(surprised)

666
00:26:30,300 --> 00:26:33,267
Well, even though your jokes are here.

667
00:26:33,367 --> 00:26:35,467
(Who is this person who
makes Jia-Hang fall in love...?)

668
00:26:36,400 --> 00:26:39,400
How to use a fan to
mimic the sound of cicada.

669
00:26:42,600 --> 00:26:44,200
Should I respond to you?

670
00:26:44,300 --> 00:26:45,567
That's enough.

671
00:26:45,667 --> 00:26:47,300
(Even though Jia-Hang is not a fan of NIO's
jokes...) I said don't bother for an answer.

672
00:26:50,167 --> 00:26:50,600
Anyway

673
00:26:50,700 --> 00:26:51,867
so

674
00:26:51,967 --> 00:26:54,200
I hope after the show is over

675
00:26:54,300 --> 00:26:55,633
there would still

676
00:26:56,667 --> 00:26:59,400
be another beginning.

677
00:26:59,500 --> 00:27:00,533
Yeah.

678
00:27:00,633 --> 00:27:02,367
Okay, pass.

679
00:27:03,567 --> 00:27:04,833
(Jia-Hang opens himself up after deciding to stay...)

680
00:27:04,933 --> 00:27:06,967
Okay, who is next?

681
00:27:07,067 --> 00:27:07,867
No one?

682
00:27:07,967 --> 00:27:09,433
Well, I'll volunteer.

683
00:27:09,533 --> 00:27:13,133
During these five days

684
00:27:13,233 --> 00:27:14,467
I think my crush is already

685
00:27:14,567 --> 00:27:16,200
aware of my feelings

686
00:27:16,300 --> 00:27:17,100
and what I'm thinking about

687
00:27:17,200 --> 00:27:19,900
I've spent enough time communicating with him.

688
00:27:19,984 --> 00:27:22,417
Guess there isn't much left to stay.

689
00:27:22,533 --> 00:27:23,667
Alright, fine, he is right here

690
00:27:23,767 --> 00:27:24,967
(pointing him out)

691
00:27:25,067 --> 00:27:26,700
No way.

692
00:27:26,800 --> 00:27:28,133
Fine, I have a huge crush on you.

693
00:27:30,867 --> 00:27:32,333
And I like you, too.

694
00:27:32,433 --> 00:27:33,733
- Alright.
- Give him a kiss

695
00:27:34,767 --> 00:27:36,000
(confirmed with eye contact)

696
00:27:36,767 --> 00:27:41,200
(Eri and NIO kissed!)

697
00:27:41,900 --> 00:27:43,367
He was brave

698
00:27:43,467 --> 00:27:44,967
I'm still a bit hesitant

699
00:27:45,067 --> 00:27:45,967
to care about nothing

700
00:27:46,067 --> 00:27:47,600
and to kiss each other.

701
00:27:47,700 --> 00:27:49,000
They are very comfortable, thinking

702
00:27:49,100 --> 00:27:49,900
they are really close

703
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:51,167
a very close friend.

704
00:27:51,267 --> 00:27:52,733
That is something to me.

705
00:27:53,567 --> 00:27:56,167
He just plucked up his courage
to tell everybody.

706
00:27:56,667 --> 00:27:58,733
Not that everyone is not aware of it.

707
00:27:58,833 --> 00:28:01,800
But when he finally said it out loud
I'm happy for him.

708
00:28:02,300 --> 00:28:03,733
Okay, who is next?

709
00:28:03,833 --> 00:28:05,533
NIO is next, since he is appointed.

710
00:28:05,633 --> 00:28:07,767
How are we gonna play this
when you guys steal the show?

711
00:28:07,867 --> 00:28:08,600
I agree

712
00:28:08,700 --> 00:28:10,433
I can kiss Bobo, too.

713
00:28:10,900 --> 00:28:12,333
Well, come on.

714
00:28:12,448 --> 00:28:13,715
(Eri and Bobo give each other a kiss)
So far away.

715
00:28:14,500 --> 00:28:16,400
So romantic.

716
00:28:17,567 --> 00:28:19,367
I want to say to my crush

717
00:28:19,467 --> 00:28:22,333
that I'm glad to have met you here

718
00:28:22,433 --> 00:28:24,867
I do wish

719
00:28:24,967 --> 00:28:27,233
to keep in touch with you in the future.

720
00:28:27,333 --> 00:28:29,267
It's been a fun time hanging out

721
00:28:29,367 --> 00:28:30,933
I hope.

722
00:28:31,033 --> 00:28:31,800
(Who is NIO talking about...?)
Thanks.

723
00:28:31,900 --> 00:28:35,033
You can be more confident
and feel better about yourself.

724
00:28:35,133 --> 00:28:39,100
Because you felt like
you weren't good enough

725
00:28:39,200 --> 00:28:40,333
or haven't been good enough.

726
00:28:40,433 --> 00:28:42,100
When I hear people say that to me

727
00:28:42,200 --> 00:28:43,533
I'd be so upset

728
00:28:43,633 --> 00:28:44,967
and I don't wish

729
00:28:45,067 --> 00:28:46,500
anyone would assume this about themselves.

730
00:28:46,600 --> 00:28:49,033
Right now, I have
something to say to every soul

731
00:28:49,133 --> 00:28:51,600
(moving speech)
just be yourself.

732
00:28:51,700 --> 00:28:53,333
- Please don't make me cry.
- You are enough.

733
00:28:53,433 --> 00:28:54,033
That's it.

734
00:29:02,033 --> 00:29:04,000
When I came first came here

735
00:29:04,100 --> 00:29:05,933
I thought I was ready to make new friends

736
00:29:06,033 --> 00:29:08,233
but I wasn't ready to fall in love.

737
00:29:08,333 --> 00:29:09,333
At the moment, I said

738
00:29:09,433 --> 00:29:10,600
I wish to have met someone.

739
00:29:10,700 --> 00:29:13,000
(Who has slowed Shi-Fung
down...?) who could slow me down

740
00:29:13,100 --> 00:29:13,900
I'm beyond glad

741
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:16,700
to meet this person on this journey

742
00:29:16,800 --> 00:29:17,833
this time around

743
00:29:17,933 --> 00:29:19,600
I'm forever grateful.

744
00:29:19,700 --> 00:29:23,467
You've taught me how to own up

745
00:29:23,567 --> 00:29:24,933
and embrace my frankness

746
00:29:25,033 --> 00:29:26,967
at the same time

747
00:29:27,067 --> 00:29:29,600
how do take my time with the outside world.

748
00:29:29,700 --> 00:29:30,800
So thank you.

749
00:29:30,900 --> 00:29:32,200
Thank you, it's amazing.

750
00:29:32,300 --> 00:29:34,267
Next.

751
00:29:34,767 --> 00:29:35,567
Okay

752
00:29:35,667 --> 00:29:39,467
I want to say to my
crush that, to be honest.

753
00:29:41,300 --> 00:29:42,733
I still like you very much

754
00:29:42,833 --> 00:29:44,000
but

755
00:29:44,900 --> 00:29:46,800
liking someone is just a process.

756
00:29:46,900 --> 00:29:49,033
Perhaps there won't be any results.

757
00:29:49,133 --> 00:29:50,667
Maybe in the future

758
00:29:50,767 --> 00:29:52,967
we might be able to stay in touch

759
00:29:53,067 --> 00:29:56,667
or cross paths in some other ways.

760
00:29:56,767 --> 00:30:00,667
Anyway, I'm glad to be here.

761
00:30:01,467 --> 00:30:03,467
I'm willing to open up

762
00:30:03,567 --> 00:30:08,400
and accept more feelings of my own.

763
00:30:09,200 --> 00:30:11,300
This is the lesson

764
00:30:11,400 --> 00:30:15,333
I have learned from liking someone

765
00:30:15,433 --> 00:30:20,017
so I've had my fun doing it.
Even though the end is near.

766
00:30:20,042 --> 00:30:23,167
(Bobo learned a more important lesson
from the process of liking "that" person)

767
00:30:23,267 --> 00:30:25,833
Well, it's alright, during the process

768
00:30:25,933 --> 00:30:29,233
I had a spiritual awakening.

769
00:30:29,333 --> 00:30:31,500
Besides, I even made myself

770
00:30:31,600 --> 00:30:35,767
an extremely valuable
friend, that's all.

771
00:30:37,700 --> 00:30:40,533
Growing up, I wasn't a fan

772
00:30:40,633 --> 00:30:41,967
of expressing my feelings.

773
00:30:42,067 --> 00:30:45,033
However, after these couple of days

774
00:30:45,133 --> 00:30:48,000
my fellow seven friends

775
00:30:48,100 --> 00:30:49,400
are just like keys.

776
00:30:49,500 --> 00:30:50,467
Each of them have, one by one

777
00:30:50,567 --> 00:30:53,233
taking turns, opened my heart.

778
00:30:53,333 --> 00:30:55,800
And Eri is the last one
to push the door open

779
00:30:55,900 --> 00:30:58,133
so lots of my feelings

780
00:30:58,233 --> 00:31:00,233
have been let out.

781
00:31:00,733 --> 00:31:02,700
I'm grateful for Bobo.

782
00:31:02,800 --> 00:31:06,000
He closed himself up, inside of his dark

783
00:31:06,100 --> 00:31:08,033
a little dark box

784
00:31:08,133 --> 00:31:09,500
I want to thank him

785
00:31:09,615 --> 00:31:11,082
for willing to drill a hole for himself.

786
00:31:11,167 --> 00:31:14,133
He saw the light and I was that beam.

787
00:31:14,233 --> 00:31:15,700
That's right.

788
00:31:16,233 --> 00:31:17,167
It's true.

789
00:31:20,033 --> 00:31:21,267
The fact that I reached out my hand

790
00:31:21,367 --> 00:31:22,400
and I could grab him

791
00:31:22,500 --> 00:31:23,900
I felt like.

792
00:31:24,500 --> 00:31:27,200
I could offer him so much warmth.

793
00:31:27,967 --> 00:31:30,600
Yeah, I could offer him so much warmth.

794
00:31:30,700 --> 00:31:37,333
(In this journey, the two became close friends
and their emotions can resonate with each other)

795
00:31:38,333 --> 00:31:42,233
I hope when you have the ability

796
00:31:42,333 --> 00:31:43,700
to help other people.

797
00:31:43,800 --> 00:31:45,867
You can reach out to
your friend to that person.

798
00:31:45,967 --> 00:31:49,533
Sometimes, lending your hand to someone

799
00:31:49,633 --> 00:31:51,600
can save the life of this person.

800
00:31:54,833 --> 00:31:57,267
Eri, I have something to say.

801
00:31:59,200 --> 00:32:01,700
Don't be afraid to
reach out your hand.

802
00:32:01,800 --> 00:32:04,500
Someone will catch you.

803
00:32:04,600 --> 00:32:07,067
We are all so willing to catch you.

804
00:32:07,700 --> 00:32:09,467
You are not that lonely

805
00:32:09,567 --> 00:32:11,367
and please do not grab any more drinks.

806
00:32:12,300 --> 00:32:14,333
- Because that's mine.
- Well, you didn't pour me one.

807
00:32:14,433 --> 00:32:16,867
Right, the bottle is empty

808
00:32:16,967 --> 00:32:18,133
I want more.

809
00:32:18,233 --> 00:32:19,600
Let me help you with that.

810
00:32:20,700 --> 00:32:23,800
(Who is the next one
to share their words?)

811
00:32:25,067 --> 00:32:30,300
I'm thankful that my crush

812
00:32:31,467 --> 00:32:35,333
takes care of me like a big brother

813
00:32:35,433 --> 00:32:37,300
I constantly feel like

814
00:32:37,833 --> 00:32:40,400
since I'm the youngest here

815
00:32:40,500 --> 00:32:43,200
I am very childish.

816
00:32:43,300 --> 00:32:44,433
On top of that

817
00:32:44,533 --> 00:32:47,500
I'm thankful for his courage.

818
00:32:47,600 --> 00:32:48,233
He lets me know

819
00:32:48,333 --> 00:32:51,567
that someone like me
is worth having in this life

820
00:32:51,667 --> 00:32:54,400
and meeting lots of amazing friends

821
00:32:55,367 --> 00:32:58,333
because I'm someone worth being loved.

822
00:32:59,767 --> 00:33:04,667
I hope when this show is over

823
00:33:04,767 --> 00:33:07,433
whether or not we keep the romance going

824
00:33:07,533 --> 00:33:10,167
or we keep meeting more amazing people

825
00:33:10,267 --> 00:33:12,200
I will be a happy person.

826
00:33:13,433 --> 00:33:14,667
Amazing.

827
00:33:14,767 --> 00:33:16,467
You are amazing.

828
00:33:16,567 --> 00:33:18,333
You are killing it.

829
00:33:18,433 --> 00:33:20,367
You are the best.

830
00:33:21,733 --> 00:33:23,567
I'm so fake, but you know.

831
00:33:26,533 --> 00:33:27,567
Cheers to you

832
00:33:27,667 --> 00:33:29,300
I only heard him a couple of times.

833
00:33:29,667 --> 00:33:31,000
Cheers.

834
00:33:31,100 --> 00:33:33,267
Oh god, just stop crying

835
00:33:42,167 --> 00:33:43,833
okay, I'll go first

836
00:33:43,933 --> 00:33:45,967
I will first talk to

837
00:33:46,067 --> 00:33:47,167
my ideal partner, sorry.

838
00:33:47,267 --> 00:33:48,233
(Even the easily nervous Susu
is trying to express himself...)

839
00:33:48,333 --> 00:33:50,800
Lots people like him, plus, I bet it's true

840
00:33:50,900 --> 00:33:53,933
that he seems to be someone

841
00:33:54,033 --> 00:33:56,567
within the circle would like.

842
00:33:56,667 --> 00:33:59,133
Yeah, I'm pleased

843
00:33:59,233 --> 00:34:01,933
that he has found
someone who likes him back.

844
00:34:02,033 --> 00:34:04,467
Hopefully, there is a chance for me

845
00:34:04,567 --> 00:34:07,667
to keep in touch with him

846
00:34:07,767 --> 00:34:09,133
and talk about

847
00:34:09,233 --> 00:34:10,933
what their future looks like.

848
00:34:11,033 --> 00:34:15,633
Well, another topic I
wanna touch on is that

849
00:34:16,633 --> 00:34:18,000
even though earlier

850
00:34:18,100 --> 00:34:20,733
I kept saying in the previous interviews

851
00:34:20,833 --> 00:34:24,100
I didn't want myself

852
00:34:24,200 --> 00:34:27,833
to get caught and fooled
by love at first sight.

853
00:34:27,933 --> 00:34:31,333
But something happened this morning

854
00:34:31,433 --> 00:34:33,000
(totally understood)
and I was a little

855
00:34:33,100 --> 00:34:34,767
shocked by it.

856
00:34:35,200 --> 00:34:36,800
(Earlier in the tent)
Well, today.

857
00:34:36,900 --> 00:34:37,967
Tell you something, earlier this morning

858
00:34:38,067 --> 00:34:40,167
I really wanted to kill you guys.

859
00:34:40,267 --> 00:34:42,167
You know, when
everyone was shipping it.

860
00:34:42,267 --> 00:34:44,533
(Before leaving, members were taking pictures
inside the cabin) Seriously, I mean it

861
00:34:44,633 --> 00:34:45,733
I wanted to

862
00:34:45,833 --> 00:34:48,067
dig a hole and hide in it.

863
00:34:48,900 --> 00:34:50,400
Yeah, during the photoshoot

864
00:34:50,500 --> 00:34:51,900
we didn't ship it intentionally

865
00:34:52,000 --> 00:34:54,500
I think it was just a fun atmosphere.

866
00:34:54,600 --> 00:34:57,200
- But that fun atmosphere.
- It made you feel awkward.

867
00:34:57,300 --> 00:34:57,833
Not awkward.

868
00:34:57,933 --> 00:34:59,667
- Initially, I was...
- Shy

869
00:34:59,767 --> 00:35:01,300
I wasn't that shy at first.

870
00:35:01,400 --> 00:35:03,267
However, after you did that.

871
00:35:03,367 --> 00:35:05,733
Well, I looked at him.

872
00:35:05,833 --> 00:35:07,000
What do you mean?

873
00:35:07,100 --> 00:35:09,633
All of a sudden, everything turned
into something else

874
00:35:09,825 --> 00:35:10,859
I had no idea what happened exactly.

875
00:35:10,967 --> 00:35:11,967
(Question/Did his heart skip a beat for Bobo?)

876
00:35:12,067 --> 00:35:13,788
People around us were
onlookers, having fun watching us.

877
00:35:13,812 --> 00:35:15,500
They basically told
us that Susu has been shy

878
00:35:15,600 --> 00:35:17,433
and he was giving me that, you know.

879
00:35:17,533 --> 00:35:20,533
He gave me that electrifying looks.

880
00:35:20,633 --> 00:35:23,300
Woah, and I was getting shy
with every minute passing by

881
00:35:23,400 --> 00:35:24,333
I didn't know what to do.

882
00:35:24,433 --> 00:35:27,500
There I was, a complete
blankness in my head.

883
00:35:27,600 --> 00:35:29,300
Then, there were just
a bunch of swear words

884
00:35:29,400 --> 00:35:32,100
popping up inside me

885
00:35:32,467 --> 00:35:34,933
I mean, well, I was kind of

886
00:35:35,033 --> 00:35:37,200
I have some feelings for him.

887
00:35:37,300 --> 00:35:39,333
Yeah, and hopefully

888
00:35:39,433 --> 00:35:40,567
if there is a chance

889
00:35:40,667 --> 00:35:42,700
I'd love to have more
conversations with him

890
00:35:42,800 --> 00:35:46,200
to get to know each other better.

891
00:35:46,300 --> 00:35:47,867
Do you want to mention the name?

892
00:35:48,433 --> 00:35:49,633
Tomorrow.

893
00:35:49,733 --> 00:35:51,567
Don't share the name with us.

894
00:35:52,433 --> 00:35:54,000
Honestly, it was not my intention

895
00:35:54,100 --> 00:35:55,333
to be led by my hormones

896
00:35:55,433 --> 00:35:57,733
and to let the hormones take full control.

897
00:35:57,833 --> 00:35:59,233
However, in the current situation.

898
00:35:59,333 --> 00:36:00,967
The hormones have taken control of me.

899
00:36:01,067 --> 00:36:02,733
Basically, for the time being

900
00:36:02,833 --> 00:36:04,500
we just have to wait and see.

901
00:36:05,100 --> 00:36:05,900
Yeah.

902
00:36:07,400 --> 00:36:10,167
It seems like Gino is the only one left.

903
00:36:11,500 --> 00:36:12,800
You're the highlight.

904
00:36:12,900 --> 00:36:13,533
What highlight?

905
00:36:13,633 --> 00:36:15,100
(Gino is the last one to share)
I have no idea what to say.

906
00:36:15,200 --> 00:36:16,700
Well.

907
00:36:16,800 --> 00:36:17,800
Guys

908
00:36:17,900 --> 00:36:20,333
I'm the oldest one.

909
00:36:20,433 --> 00:36:22,500
Surprisingly

910
00:36:22,600 --> 00:36:27,200
in this whole different generation

911
00:36:27,300 --> 00:36:28,967
I'm happy that I ran into you

912
00:36:29,067 --> 00:36:31,933
to see this younger version of me

913
00:36:32,033 --> 00:36:33,900
to realize I was once this person.

914
00:36:33,984 --> 00:36:36,510
(Guan-Yu couldn't stop his streaming tears from
falling...)

915
00:36:36,535 --> 00:36:40,057
Seeing the way you are, it
reminds me of who I was before this

916
00:36:40,167 --> 00:36:43,367
I used to work so hard to grow.

917
00:36:43,467 --> 00:36:45,233
Probably a little too much to the point

918
00:36:45,333 --> 00:36:47,467
where I feel like
I could give you some advice.

919
00:36:47,567 --> 00:36:48,833
Later, I've realized

920
00:36:48,933 --> 00:36:52,875
that those experiences
aren't necessarily required.

921
00:36:52,900 --> 00:36:55,867
On the contrary, some support
and being there with you.

922
00:36:55,967 --> 00:36:56,800
These little things

923
00:36:56,900 --> 00:36:59,300
aren't something I am
the only who could offer.

924
00:36:59,400 --> 00:37:01,367
Everybody could give you that.

925
00:37:01,467 --> 00:37:03,767
Instead of speaking to my crush

926
00:37:03,867 --> 00:37:06,700
I'd like to say to everyone.

927
00:37:08,433 --> 00:37:12,767
To truth is, about the recording yesterday

928
00:37:12,867 --> 00:37:15,833
I have left a message

929
00:37:15,933 --> 00:37:19,867
a unique message to everyone here.

930
00:37:19,967 --> 00:37:21,067
No wonder you took such a long time.

931
00:37:21,167 --> 00:37:22,533
Yeah, super long

932
00:37:22,633 --> 00:37:27,667
I even sang a song in the end

933
00:37:27,767 --> 00:37:29,767
I'd like to invite everyone.

934
00:37:29,867 --> 00:37:31,533
Hang on, is it a good song?

935
00:37:35,600 --> 00:37:38,300
Since I'm the last one to share

936
00:37:38,400 --> 00:37:40,633
I'd like to invite everyone to sing.

937
00:37:40,733 --> 00:37:42,233
You guys can sing with me.

938
00:37:42,333 --> 00:37:43,500
Is that alright.

939
00:37:43,600 --> 00:37:44,833
You must know this song.

940
00:37:45,200 --> 00:37:49,467
The more we get together

941
00:37:49,567 --> 00:37:53,567
the merrier we'll be.

942
00:37:55,267 --> 00:38:01,200
(Everyone follows Gino, singing and
bringing the night's sharing to a close)

943
00:38:04,500 --> 00:38:07,600
The more we get together.

944
00:38:07,700 --> 00:38:11,633
(Expressing fully to avoid regrets...)
the merrier we'll be.

945
00:38:13,933 --> 00:38:17,367
After these couple of days

946
00:38:17,467 --> 00:38:22,000
we might have just bonded
a beautiful friendship.

947
00:38:22,100 --> 00:38:24,033
For one hand, I know tomorrow is the end.

948
00:38:24,133 --> 00:38:25,200
On the other hand

949
00:38:25,300 --> 00:38:26,500
if I have feelings for someone

950
00:38:26,600 --> 00:38:28,533
or someone who likes me

951
00:38:28,633 --> 00:38:31,467
we all have to come clean

952
00:38:31,567 --> 00:38:32,967
followed by the ending.

953
00:38:33,067 --> 00:38:33,967
Specifically

954
00:38:34,067 --> 00:38:37,700
it's hard to let that go.

955
00:38:39,167 --> 00:38:41,000
Drink up.

956
00:38:42,000 --> 00:38:43,667
Thank god we talked it out

957
00:38:43,767 --> 00:38:46,067
I really like you.

958
00:39:06,633 --> 00:39:08,800
Did you guys

959
00:39:08,900 --> 00:39:10,333
receive the texts tonight?

960
00:39:10,433 --> 00:39:14,400
- Yes.
- There is a talent show.

961
00:39:14,500 --> 00:39:15,900
Yes.

962
00:39:16,133 --> 00:39:17,600
(Earlier at Orange Cafe, people got a text)

963
00:39:17,700 --> 00:39:19,833
Incoming text.

964
00:39:19,933 --> 00:39:21,433
(Rule/Camp Fire Time!)
Please prepare a performance.

965
00:39:21,533 --> 00:39:23,167
(Please prepare a small performance to show
off yourself!) See you at the campfire.

966
00:39:23,700 --> 00:39:24,467
Right now?

967
00:39:24,567 --> 00:39:25,400
- Performance.
- What on earth.

968
00:39:25,500 --> 00:39:26,167
What does it even mean?

969
00:39:26,267 --> 00:39:27,467
Guys, take a look at the text.

970
00:39:27,567 --> 00:39:29,833
Small performance.

971
00:39:29,933 --> 00:39:32,067
- Stripping.
- Performance.

972
00:39:32,167 --> 00:39:33,467
You, performance art.

973
00:39:34,267 --> 00:39:35,900
Effortlessly.

974
00:39:36,000 --> 00:39:37,200
Then this would be my performance.

975
00:39:37,667 --> 00:39:40,633
Effortlessly.

976
00:39:41,567 --> 00:39:44,767
I'd like to ask
who wants to go first.

977
00:39:45,600 --> 00:39:47,400
Okay, come on.

978
00:39:47,500 --> 00:39:48,033
OK

979
00:39:48,133 --> 00:39:49,267
I feel like.

980
00:39:49,367 --> 00:39:51,800
(Shi-Fung volunteered to be the first performer)
Previously in the interviews I've mentioned so many times

981
00:39:51,900 --> 00:39:53,733
- that it took tons of courage to come here.
- Yeah

982
00:39:53,833 --> 00:39:55,867
I've got a little amulet

983
00:39:55,967 --> 00:39:58,300
and I want to bring
this amulet to everyone.

984
00:39:58,400 --> 00:40:00,633
This is a song I cherish very much.

985
00:40:00,733 --> 00:40:02,567
Yeah, right.

986
00:40:02,667 --> 00:40:03,767
Alright.

987
00:40:03,867 --> 00:40:04,467
Come on.

988
00:40:05,809 --> 00:40:12,009
(Shi-Fung sang a song for calmness within
oneself) I really like the way you are

989
00:40:12,133 --> 00:40:17,200
I really adore the temper you have.

990
00:40:17,300 --> 00:40:20,967
Sometimes silence

991
00:40:21,067 --> 00:40:25,500
is more than a thousand-word.

992
00:40:26,033 --> 00:40:30,767
I really like the way you are.

993
00:40:30,867 --> 00:40:32,667
The song Shi-Fung sang is contagious.

994
00:40:32,767 --> 00:40:34,433
(Question/Why does he moved by Shi-Fung's
song?) I'm still stuck in that moment.

995
00:40:34,533 --> 00:40:36,233
Probably first of all.

996
00:40:36,333 --> 00:40:38,833
Bobo was crying nonstop.

997
00:40:38,933 --> 00:40:42,667
Once I saw him cry, I just...

998
00:40:42,900 --> 00:40:47,333
(Bobo couldn't stop tearing up after suppressing
them for years and it affected Gino, too...)

999
00:40:47,567 --> 00:40:49,500
It resonates well with all of us.

1000
00:40:49,600 --> 00:40:52,733
Saying that, we just have to be ourselves.

1001
00:40:52,833 --> 00:40:55,233
This is my biggest takeaway

1002
00:40:55,333 --> 00:40:57,733
from this show ever, to be myself.

1003
00:40:58,667 --> 00:41:03,567
I really like the way you are.

1004
00:41:04,100 --> 00:41:05,767
Thank you.

1005
00:41:05,867 --> 00:41:07,933
Tell you something people said
plenty of things during the show.

1006
00:41:08,033 --> 00:41:10,233
(Shi-Fung used his voice as a reflection of
his mind) I only absorbed these sentences.

1007
00:41:10,800 --> 00:41:12,567
And that'd be enough.

1008
00:41:13,600 --> 00:41:14,400
Fantastic.

1009
00:41:14,500 --> 00:41:16,133
This is the best thing ever.

1010
00:41:26,433 --> 00:41:29,567
The thing is, many people consider us gay

1011
00:41:29,667 --> 00:41:32,367
as some monsters.

1012
00:41:32,467 --> 00:41:35,467
Yeah, so I'd like to sing "Creep".

1013
00:41:35,567 --> 00:41:36,667
Even if

1014
00:41:36,767 --> 00:41:38,800
I couldn't sing it well.

1015
00:41:39,767 --> 00:41:42,700
I'd still like to face this campfire

1016
00:41:42,800 --> 00:41:44,233
and sing the song to you.

1017
00:41:44,767 --> 00:41:47,200
Thank you, guys.

1018
00:41:48,233 --> 00:41:49,167
I have chosen a song

1019
00:41:49,267 --> 00:41:50,633
by one of my favorite English singer.

1020
00:41:50,733 --> 00:41:51,900
(NIO uses this song as a
encouragement) It's Labrinth

1021
00:41:52,000 --> 00:41:53,800
I'm tired, like you're exhausted.

1022
00:41:53,900 --> 00:41:56,700
- He's tired.
- I think the song "I'm tired"

1023
00:41:56,800 --> 00:41:58,500
is talking about the fact

1024
00:41:58,600 --> 00:41:59,400
that a lot of times

1025
00:41:59,500 --> 00:42:01,267
we would search for
unhealthy relationships.

1026
00:42:01,367 --> 00:42:02,633
Here, I want to encourage everyone

1027
00:42:02,733 --> 00:42:05,500
not to get tangled up

1028
00:42:05,600 --> 00:42:07,367
in an unhealthy relationship.

1029
00:42:07,467 --> 00:42:08,433
- Yeah.
- How's that?

1030
00:42:33,900 --> 00:42:36,000
(Guan-Yu chose the song that is
important to him) I'm here with a song

1031
00:42:36,100 --> 00:42:38,900
called Freedom by Yoga Lin.

1032
00:42:39,000 --> 00:42:39,167
Nice.

1033
00:42:39,267 --> 00:42:42,200
This is the song when I realized.

1034
00:42:42,767 --> 00:42:44,133
I like boys.

1035
00:42:44,233 --> 00:42:44,967
Hearing this song

1036
00:42:45,067 --> 00:42:46,767
is incredible

1037
00:42:47,500 --> 00:42:49,300
every time I had breakups

1038
00:42:49,400 --> 00:42:51,767
I'd come back and listen to it again.

1039
00:43:06,633 --> 00:43:07,667
After I graduated.

1040
00:43:07,767 --> 00:43:10,067
(Guan Yu, who studied music,
I've never sung in front of everyone again

1041
00:43:10,167 --> 00:43:12,300
is not comfortable singing in front of others)
- Hopefully - This is your first time

1042
00:43:12,400 --> 00:43:13,000
I mena.

1043
00:43:13,100 --> 00:43:13,600
It's fantastic

1044
00:43:13,700 --> 00:43:15,000
I hope you guys can know

1045
00:43:15,100 --> 00:43:16,333
that it's rare for me to do this

1046
00:43:16,433 --> 00:43:18,067
but I am willing to do it in front of you.

1047
00:43:18,167 --> 00:43:21,167
Thank you for trusting us.

1048
00:43:21,800 --> 00:43:24,033
(Bobo is encouraging everyone to be
brave with a song) Okay, I'm singing a song

1049
00:43:24,133 --> 00:43:25,900
even though I'm not good at it.

1050
00:43:36,133 --> 00:43:42,567
(By the campfire, everyone
sends a message with a song...)

1051
00:43:42,667 --> 00:43:44,500
Well, what I want to say is

1052
00:43:44,600 --> 00:43:47,333
whether you are watching this or right here

1053
00:43:47,433 --> 00:43:48,967
not for what you...

1054
00:43:49,067 --> 00:43:51,533
If you really like something

1055
00:43:51,633 --> 00:43:52,533
keep on trying.

1056
00:43:52,633 --> 00:43:55,633
Do not feel upset when you are running to

1057
00:43:55,733 --> 00:43:57,833
some obstacles.

1058
00:43:57,933 --> 00:44:00,533
We gotta embrace the hurdles.

1059
00:44:00,633 --> 00:44:02,533
After all, we are all gay.

1060
00:44:02,633 --> 00:44:04,467
We need to accept a lot of things.

1061
00:44:04,567 --> 00:44:06,533
So guys, let's keep on fighting, shall we?

1062
00:44:06,633 --> 00:44:08,467
Yes.

1063
00:44:12,367 --> 00:44:14,300
Anyway, I'm having fun

1064
00:44:14,400 --> 00:44:17,333
I bet every one of you is having fun, too.

1065
00:44:17,433 --> 00:44:18,167
(Is this warm and touching
night coming to an end?) Worth it.

1066
00:44:18,267 --> 00:44:19,267
Yes, it is so worth it.

1067
00:44:19,367 --> 00:44:21,467
Everything about today is surprising

1068
00:44:21,567 --> 00:44:22,433
I did not expect

1069
00:44:22,533 --> 00:44:24,633
everyone cried like a baby

1070
00:44:24,733 --> 00:44:27,133
I mean, what on earth.

1071
00:44:33,700 --> 00:44:36,033
(The crew surprise everyone with
the fireworks!) It came so sudden.

1072
00:44:39,000 --> 00:44:43,233
Happy New Year.

1073
00:44:43,900 --> 00:44:45,000
This truly is

1074
00:44:45,100 --> 00:44:48,967
a unique and incredible experience.

1075
00:44:49,067 --> 00:44:50,567
We all are enjoying

1076
00:44:50,667 --> 00:44:52,533
this whole process of production.

1077
00:44:52,633 --> 00:44:54,533
This way of meeting new people

1078
00:44:54,633 --> 00:44:56,233
is far better than having a cup of coffee.

1079
00:44:56,333 --> 00:44:57,300
It's like, wanna have coffee with me

1080
00:44:57,400 --> 00:44:59,933
or do you wanna be on
a romantic show with me.

1081
00:45:00,867 --> 00:45:01,633
I agree.

1082
00:45:10,133 --> 00:45:11,200
It's gorgeous.

1083
00:45:21,567 --> 00:45:27,000
(There is always an end even with the
fireworks but their stories will continue...)

1084
00:45:27,700 --> 00:45:28,667
(Eri and Shi-Fung present bonus performance)

1085
00:45:28,767 --> 00:45:31,133
- Is there music?
- I love music.

1086
00:45:31,233 --> 00:45:33,633
Don't tell me to stop.

1087
00:45:38,467 --> 00:45:43,367
(Use your last strength
to enjoy this night!)

1088
00:46:24,933 --> 00:46:27,367
Everyone is so carefree.

1089
00:46:27,467 --> 00:46:29,167
From the first day to the last one

1090
00:46:29,267 --> 00:46:32,800
we got so much closer together.

1091
00:46:32,900 --> 00:46:35,400
A reserved person becomes very open.

1092
00:46:35,500 --> 00:46:37,400
People who were afraid to be themselves

1093
00:46:37,500 --> 00:46:38,233
they opened up.

1094
00:46:38,333 --> 00:46:39,900
This is amazing news.

1095
00:46:49,367 --> 00:46:51,033
When I was playing magic wand

1096
00:46:51,133 --> 00:46:53,633
I thought it was a perfect time

1097
00:46:53,733 --> 00:46:55,800
to say goodbye to a relationship

1098
00:46:55,900 --> 00:46:58,567
and to start over again

1099
00:46:58,667 --> 00:46:59,633
I feel powerful.

1100
00:46:59,733 --> 00:47:03,333
Guys, don't give up.

1101
00:47:03,433 --> 00:47:05,867
Just start over again.

1102
00:47:27,600 --> 00:47:31,733
(As the journey nears its end the day of
the final decision has finally arrived...)

1103
00:47:32,767 --> 00:47:34,033
(The Church of Wind)

1104
00:47:35,300 --> 00:47:37,100
(At the end of the journey,
who would you choose?)

1105
00:47:37,200 --> 00:47:39,900
I am certain he likes me.

1106
00:47:40,800 --> 00:47:42,233
Surprisingly.

1107
00:47:42,800 --> 00:47:44,600
You thought I'd choose Guan-Yu

1108
00:47:44,733 --> 00:47:45,767
I got to know him better

1109
00:47:45,867 --> 00:47:48,333
and my affection toward him is growing.

1110
00:47:48,633 --> 00:47:50,933
Even if we end up together

1111
00:47:51,033 --> 00:47:52,367
it'll be a tough one.

1112
00:47:52,600 --> 00:47:54,400
He is a great listener

1113
00:47:54,500 --> 00:47:56,100
and an excellent feedback giver.

1114
00:47:58,533 --> 00:47:59,533
It's hard.

1115
00:48:01,200 --> 00:48:03,233
If... see, I'm hesitant.

1116
00:48:06,333 --> 00:48:12,700
(With a change of attire they bring the most
heartfelt sincerity to face the answers...)

1117
00:48:21,767 --> 00:48:23,800
(The tape with the ultimate results)

1118
00:48:23,900 --> 00:48:26,533
(Who can hear each other's hearts...?)

1119
00:48:26,633 --> 00:48:30,133
(The emotional rollercoaster grand finale
is about to unfold with twists and turns)
