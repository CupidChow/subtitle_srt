1
00:00:02,633 --> 00:00:04,200
(Previously)
Let's go.

2
00:00:04,300 --> 00:00:06,067
Okay, bye.

3
00:00:08,700 --> 00:00:10,467
Did we just fail to get matched?

4
00:00:10,567 --> 00:00:11,600
Apparently.

5
00:00:12,033 --> 00:00:14,233
A lot of people are looking for happiness

6
00:00:14,333 --> 00:00:15,433
but they've never realized

7
00:00:15,533 --> 00:00:16,467
happiness is right beside them

8
00:00:16,567 --> 00:00:19,933
I think Bobo gives me a lot of happiness.

9
00:00:23,300 --> 00:00:25,533
In my opinion, our
lifestyles may differ a lot

10
00:00:25,633 --> 00:00:27,933
but that's when communications come in.

11
00:00:28,033 --> 00:00:30,233
After all, we can't just block out

12
00:00:30,333 --> 00:00:32,500
the possibilities of love
because of trivial things.

13
00:00:33,700 --> 00:00:35,733
The four of us went back
to the very first beginning

14
00:00:35,833 --> 00:00:38,967
and meet each other regardless
of who we are now.

15
00:00:39,067 --> 00:00:40,167
Have a nice chat.

16
00:00:40,267 --> 00:00:41,800
So far, this probably has been

17
00:00:41,900 --> 00:00:43,633
my favorite day.

18
00:00:54,200 --> 00:00:55,567
(Bobo)

19
00:00:55,667 --> 00:00:57,067
(Shih-Feng)

20
00:00:57,167 --> 00:00:58,200
(NIO)

21
00:00:58,300 --> 00:00:59,767
(Gino)

22
00:00:59,867 --> 00:01:01,367
(Guan-Yu)

23
00:01:01,467 --> 00:01:02,600
(Eri)

24
00:01:02,700 --> 00:01:04,200
(Susu)

25
00:01:04,300 --> 00:01:06,133
(Jia-Hang)

26
00:01:11,333 --> 00:01:13,100
(Boys Like Boys)

27
00:01:13,200 --> 00:01:15,967
(Episode 7: I'll get sad
if I stay here any longer)

28
00:01:28,633 --> 00:01:31,533
(It's dinner time again)

29
00:01:32,800 --> 00:01:35,333
(There are only three people
when the dinner's ready...)

30
00:01:35,433 --> 00:01:36,533
Hotpot, huh?

31
00:01:37,300 --> 00:01:38,133
I'm tired.

32
00:01:38,233 --> 00:01:38,733
What's their deal now?

33
00:01:38,833 --> 00:01:41,467
Still going hard over there?

34
00:01:42,200 --> 00:01:44,400
It may be like a huge reconciliation.

35
00:01:44,500 --> 00:01:46,267
Oh, alright.

36
00:01:46,733 --> 00:01:47,700
Thanks.

37
00:01:47,933 --> 00:01:49,867
(What are they going
through in those rooms now...)

38
00:01:49,967 --> 00:01:50,833
Gonna scold them.

39
00:01:50,933 --> 00:01:53,467
Alright, go ahead,
I wanna see!

40
00:01:54,100 --> 00:01:56,933
- Checking over here.
- It's meat with pickled cabbage hotpot.

41
00:01:57,033 --> 00:02:00,367
Guys, are you guys
joining dinner? I'm starving.

42
00:02:00,467 --> 00:02:01,267
(NIO and Eri borrowed
another room to discuss things)

43
00:02:01,367 --> 00:02:02,633
Not at all.

44
00:02:02,733 --> 00:02:04,567
Come on, let's go eat

45
00:02:04,667 --> 00:02:07,867
(patting)
I'm fine, all good.

46
00:02:07,967 --> 00:02:08,967
- Alright, let's go eat.
- Let's go.

47
00:02:09,067 --> 00:02:10,167
Let's join the dinner.

48
00:02:10,267 --> 00:02:13,233
(They end their
conversation with a big hug...)

49
00:02:13,514 --> 00:02:15,677
Alright, I gotta take responsibility.

50
00:02:15,702 --> 00:02:17,908
(Shih-Feng, Guan-Yu, and
Gino are chatting in another room)

51
00:02:17,933 --> 00:02:19,133
Nah, I just feel like
there is so much drama

52
00:02:19,233 --> 00:02:21,267
and it seems like I was the troublemaker.

53
00:02:21,367 --> 00:02:23,467
(This room feels kind of down...)

54
00:02:23,567 --> 00:02:26,233
(NIO hurries them to join dinner)
Did you guys receive the text about dinner?

55
00:02:26,333 --> 00:02:28,933
- Is it dinner time?
- Where's my phone?

56
00:02:30,633 --> 00:02:32,567
I'm coming...

57
00:02:36,200 --> 00:02:37,667
(The rest are starting to
come out of the room) Thanks.

58
00:02:39,333 --> 00:02:41,200
Should we switch seats?

59
00:02:41,933 --> 00:02:43,100
Yeah.

60
00:02:44,133 --> 00:02:47,133
Surrounded by two tall people

61
00:02:47,233 --> 00:02:48,533
- I'm blessed.
- Happy then?

62
00:02:48,633 --> 00:02:50,267
Yeah, I am delighted.

63
00:02:50,600 --> 00:02:52,167
- What?
- Nothing.

64
00:02:52,267 --> 00:02:55,467
With you sitting there,
it is obvious that...

65
00:02:55,567 --> 00:02:56,300
You feel alone?

66
00:02:56,400 --> 00:02:57,100
Yeah.

67
00:02:57,200 --> 00:02:57,733
(On the fourth day people start to
care about the seat arrangement)

68
00:02:57,833 --> 00:02:59,733
Then I'll sit somewhere else, I haven't...

69
00:02:59,833 --> 00:03:00,800
It's alright. It's fine.

70
00:03:00,900 --> 00:03:03,467
It's good, I like to eat, anyway

71
00:03:03,567 --> 00:03:04,833
I will go seat over there.

72
00:03:04,933 --> 00:03:06,233
Yeah, it is more even.

73
00:03:06,333 --> 00:03:07,100
Come on, Bobo.

74
00:03:07,200 --> 00:03:08,733
Yes, it works fine.

75
00:03:08,833 --> 00:03:09,800
They can be our hosts.

76
00:03:09,900 --> 00:03:10,967
Yeah.

77
00:03:13,267 --> 00:03:16,367
- Coming, sorry.
- Take the host seat

78
00:03:16,467 --> 00:03:18,300
(solemn expressions)
I'm digging in.

79
00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:19,133
Watch out.

80
00:03:19,233 --> 00:03:21,033
(Everyone is seated after the musical chairs)
- I'm digging in - I'm gonna start the fire.

81
00:03:21,133 --> 00:03:22,433
Go ahead.

82
00:03:25,800 --> 00:03:27,033
Do you guys wanna eat something? I'll help.

83
00:03:27,133 --> 00:03:27,967
Or just help yourself out?

84
00:03:28,067 --> 00:03:29,200
It's alright.

85
00:03:29,300 --> 00:03:31,500
The table is unusually quiet.

86
00:03:31,600 --> 00:03:32,500
Dead silent.

87
00:03:32,600 --> 00:03:34,600
Yeah, let's not do that.

88
00:03:40,133 --> 00:03:43,733
(What exactly happened
before this dinner...?)

89
00:03:45,133 --> 00:03:47,000
(Before dinner, Eri wanted to talk to Shih-Feng)
Yeah, let's talk here

90
00:03:47,100 --> 00:03:48,900
I have to apologize for yesterday.

91
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:49,867
Apologize? Why is that?

92
00:03:49,967 --> 00:03:52,300
When I left abruptly
yesterday, it was a little.

93
00:03:52,325 --> 00:03:53,473
It was fine if you didn't tell me.

94
00:03:53,528 --> 00:03:55,128
(Yesterday, Shih-Feng left suddenly
during conversations with Eri about NIO)

95
00:03:55,153 --> 00:03:56,867
It's alright, just tell me
I want to hear your point.

96
00:03:58,700 --> 00:03:59,700
As for NIO

97
00:03:59,800 --> 00:04:01,600
I'm really not in the position to tell you.

98
00:04:01,700 --> 00:04:03,367
You know what I mean? Because...

99
00:04:03,467 --> 00:04:07,400
NIO has told me about you.

100
00:04:07,500 --> 00:04:09,267
That's a form of trust.

101
00:04:09,367 --> 00:04:12,567
You're teasing me
and I don't like it when people do that

102
00:04:12,667 --> 00:04:14,600
I can understand.

103
00:04:15,133 --> 00:04:16,233
(Communication between
the two has hit a deadlock...)

104
00:04:16,333 --> 00:04:18,000
And?

105
00:04:19,067 --> 00:04:20,367
You can just get to the point

106
00:04:20,467 --> 00:04:21,200
I think you can just.

107
00:04:21,300 --> 00:04:21,967
No, but...

108
00:04:22,067 --> 00:04:23,533
Do you know why I can't just tell you?

109
00:04:23,633 --> 00:04:24,867
I get it. I have to respect him.

110
00:04:24,967 --> 00:04:27,267
Besides, I think that is

111
00:04:27,367 --> 00:04:29,100
something happened in our quad.

112
00:04:29,192 --> 00:04:31,059
That's our teamwork and trust

113
00:04:31,167 --> 00:04:33,500
with the four of us in the quad.

114
00:04:33,600 --> 00:04:34,900
I get it, but currently

115
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:36,367
the position you're in is that

116
00:04:36,467 --> 00:04:39,233
you won't be respecting me
if you didn't finish your sentence.

117
00:04:39,333 --> 00:04:41,133
So now you're offending both sides.

118
00:04:41,233 --> 00:04:42,867
Now it's up to you on how to handle this.

119
00:04:42,967 --> 00:04:44,767
It's your choice.

120
00:04:46,033 --> 00:04:47,267
Alright, how about this

121
00:04:47,367 --> 00:04:49,533
I will tell you now.
Would they make you feel better?

122
00:04:49,633 --> 00:04:50,267
I will feel better.

123
00:04:50,367 --> 00:04:52,467
Okay, then let's address one thing.

124
00:04:52,567 --> 00:04:54,333
Just hear me out

125
00:04:54,433 --> 00:04:55,567
and tell me if you can accept the deal

126
00:04:55,667 --> 00:04:58,467
which is not telling anyone about it.

127
00:04:58,567 --> 00:04:59,800
Of course, I will tell no one.

128
00:04:59,900 --> 00:05:02,500
You know, it's no good passing this around.

129
00:05:02,600 --> 00:05:04,333
It's not good

130
00:05:04,433 --> 00:05:06,733
I get it, I won't tell anyone.

131
00:05:06,833 --> 00:05:08,867
Because you were kind
of drunk that day, so...

132
00:05:08,967 --> 00:05:11,300
- But you remember.
- I know. I remember everything.

133
00:05:11,400 --> 00:05:13,767
Yeah, so what he was saying is.

134
00:05:13,867 --> 00:05:17,667
(Last night, Bobo tried to set up Eri and NIO)
when Bobo nudged you and that whole situation.

135
00:05:17,767 --> 00:05:21,333
He said you guys were a little like

136
00:05:21,433 --> 00:05:22,400
"square-brackets." [TN: Shih-Feng
is implying some kind of exclusivity]

137
00:05:22,500 --> 00:05:26,833
(Shih-Feng explains how NIO is feeling to
Eri) But he thinks nothing is settled yet.

138
00:05:26,933 --> 00:05:29,333
Did I make you more comfortable?

139
00:05:30,033 --> 00:05:31,800
I think you missed the point

140
00:05:31,900 --> 00:05:33,133
that I want to hear

141
00:05:33,233 --> 00:05:36,100
I don't even know what
I want to hear, anyway.

142
00:05:36,200 --> 00:05:38,433
But, well, I guess

143
00:05:38,533 --> 00:05:40,700
that's probably the
end of our conversation.

144
00:05:40,800 --> 00:05:43,100
Yeah, you know...

145
00:05:43,200 --> 00:05:45,067
I'm less uncomfortable now.

146
00:05:45,167 --> 00:05:46,467
Okay

147
00:05:47,033 --> 00:05:48,633
I'll go talk to him later.

148
00:05:48,733 --> 00:05:49,733
Okay

149
00:05:49,833 --> 00:05:52,900
I'm gonna tell him
why I acted that way yesterday.

150
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:54,033
Yeah, go ahead.

151
00:05:54,133 --> 00:05:55,933
(Eri decided to go talk to NIO)
It's all good.

152
00:05:56,033 --> 00:05:56,700
What?

153
00:05:56,800 --> 00:05:57,533
Nothing.

154
00:05:59,267 --> 00:06:04,667
(NIO accepted Eri's invitation Shih-Feng,
Guan-Yu and Gino stay in the same room)

155
00:06:06,467 --> 00:06:08,167
(Shih-Feng can hardly
hide his melancholy...)

156
00:06:08,267 --> 00:06:08,600
What's wrong?

157
00:06:08,700 --> 00:06:09,433
Nothing, I'm fine.

158
00:06:09,533 --> 00:06:10,967
It's just a little
stressful over here

159
00:06:11,067 --> 00:06:13,033
I'm also kind of stressed, too.

160
00:06:13,133 --> 00:06:14,000
A bit stressed out over here.

161
00:06:14,100 --> 00:06:16,400
But you know what? I gotta own it.

162
00:06:18,133 --> 00:06:19,400
It's just so much drama

163
00:06:19,500 --> 00:06:22,100
and it seems like I'm the troublemaker.

164
00:06:24,933 --> 00:06:27,100
(Now it's Eri and NIO's turn to
talk it out) So? Are you nervous?

165
00:06:27,200 --> 00:06:28,200
- Okay.
- I'm not.

166
00:06:28,300 --> 00:06:29,900
Want me in another or the same bed?

167
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:30,833
Suits yourself.

168
00:06:30,933 --> 00:06:32,500
- Then the same one it is.
- Okay.

169
00:06:32,600 --> 00:06:33,900
- Alright.
- Okay.

170
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:35,433
Anyway.

171
00:06:35,533 --> 00:06:39,600
Shih-Feng told me that yesterday

172
00:06:39,700 --> 00:06:41,833
you guys talked about me.

173
00:06:42,433 --> 00:06:43,833
However.

174
00:06:44,433 --> 00:06:46,433
I was curious why you guys talked about me

175
00:06:46,533 --> 00:06:47,400
(cutting right to the chase...)
but he didn't spill.

176
00:06:47,500 --> 00:06:50,133
(cutting right to the chase...) Since,
you know, it's your secret and respect.

177
00:06:50,233 --> 00:06:51,800
But somehow I feel like.

178
00:06:52,833 --> 00:06:55,433
Since he already mentioned it
without giving me the whole picture

179
00:06:55,533 --> 00:06:57,733
it is disrespectful to me.

180
00:06:57,833 --> 00:07:00,000
But now I have no interest in knowing

181
00:07:00,100 --> 00:07:03,200
what you guys said concerning me.

182
00:07:03,300 --> 00:07:05,800
(Eri expresses his feelings toward NIO)
What I mean is that, I don't wanna give you

183
00:07:05,900 --> 00:07:09,967
this impression that on this very matter

184
00:07:10,067 --> 00:07:11,900
there's a little side note

185
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:15,067
like, I'm declaring my intentions,

186
00:07:15,152 --> 00:07:16,267
like I'm telling you guys.

187
00:07:16,367 --> 00:07:18,800
"Hey, I like him, don't touch him"

188
00:07:18,900 --> 00:07:20,200
- I'm not that kind of person.
- I know.

189
00:07:20,300 --> 00:07:22,300
That's what I mainly
want to talk to you about

190
00:07:22,400 --> 00:07:23,000
I'm done

191
00:07:23,100 --> 00:07:25,733
I want to put zero pressure on you.

192
00:07:25,833 --> 00:07:27,800
No pressure at all.

193
00:07:27,900 --> 00:07:28,633
Okay, then...

194
00:07:28,733 --> 00:07:29,967
Not at all.

195
00:07:30,067 --> 00:07:31,933
Come on, let's go eat

196
00:07:32,033 --> 00:07:35,200
(it was a hug that unraveled a
misunderstanding) It's all good now.

197
00:07:35,300 --> 00:07:36,267
- We're good, let's go eat.
- Let's go.

198
00:07:36,367 --> 00:07:37,833
Dinner time.

199
00:07:41,400 --> 00:07:43,633
The table is unusually quiet.

200
00:07:43,733 --> 00:07:44,633
Dead silence.

201
00:07:44,733 --> 00:07:46,133
Let's not do that.

202
00:07:46,233 --> 00:07:47,867
Don't do that.

203
00:07:47,967 --> 00:07:49,767
But I'm having fun.

204
00:07:50,467 --> 00:07:52,533
Topic box

205
00:07:52,633 --> 00:07:54,333
(drawing the topic today)
Alright, what's in there today.

206
00:07:54,433 --> 00:07:56,300
What's thing we want to know?

207
00:07:57,067 --> 00:07:58,933
Right, today we are talking about

208
00:07:59,033 --> 00:08:00,200
regrets and remorse.

209
00:08:00,300 --> 00:08:01,254
(Today's Topic: regrets and remorse)

210
00:08:02,400 --> 00:08:03,367
I love it.

211
00:08:03,467 --> 00:08:05,433
What on earth?

212
00:08:05,533 --> 00:08:06,933
It's annoying.

213
00:08:07,400 --> 00:08:09,100
Well, who goes first?

214
00:08:09,200 --> 00:08:10,800
How about Jia-Hang?

215
00:08:10,900 --> 00:08:12,967
I bet your stories are intriguing.

216
00:08:13,067 --> 00:08:14,400
Can I do it later?

217
00:08:14,500 --> 00:08:16,967
- My brain is totally blank.
- Of course.

218
00:08:17,067 --> 00:08:18,533
Or do you wanna go first?

219
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:20,233
I need to calm down.

220
00:08:20,333 --> 00:08:21,167
Yeah, everyone needs to calm down.

221
00:08:21,267 --> 00:08:23,533
Forget it, let me go first. How's that?

222
00:08:23,633 --> 00:08:25,733
(Eri first shares her stories when
everyone is down...) Regret and remorse.

223
00:08:25,833 --> 00:08:27,533
Personally.

224
00:08:27,967 --> 00:08:31,367
Sometimes, what I regret is that

225
00:08:32,700 --> 00:08:36,867
there are a lot of times
when I'm with my parents

226
00:08:36,967 --> 00:08:39,367
where I couldn't be completely honest

227
00:08:39,467 --> 00:08:41,700
about lots of things with them

228
00:08:41,800 --> 00:08:44,600
but I've never regretted any decisions

229
00:08:44,700 --> 00:08:45,933
that I made.

230
00:08:46,033 --> 00:08:49,067
For example, I went to the talent show.

231
00:08:49,167 --> 00:08:50,233
Got eliminated

232
00:08:50,333 --> 00:08:51,800
I don't regret that.

233
00:08:51,900 --> 00:08:55,000
Like, sitting right here with you guys

234
00:08:55,100 --> 00:08:56,967
I'm not regretting it at all.

235
00:08:57,933 --> 00:09:00,800
Meeting Bobo is a blessing.

236
00:09:00,900 --> 00:09:02,333
Yeah, it really is.

237
00:09:02,433 --> 00:09:04,067
Can't believe there is a way

238
00:09:04,167 --> 00:09:04,933
which I can truly feel

239
00:09:05,033 --> 00:09:08,167
the warmth of his hug without holding me

240
00:09:08,267 --> 00:09:10,833
I can feel his warmth

241
00:09:10,933 --> 00:09:13,933
I cherish him very much, yeah.

242
00:09:14,033 --> 00:09:16,467
Actually, happiness is around us.

243
00:09:16,567 --> 00:09:18,167
Don't cry.

244
00:09:18,267 --> 00:09:19,600
That makes me very glad.

245
00:09:19,700 --> 00:09:21,000
Tissues.

246
00:09:21,100 --> 00:09:23,967
Whether I'm leaving today.

247
00:09:24,067 --> 00:09:25,800
(Bobo was moved to tears by Eri's heartfelt
confession) or someone else is leaving today

248
00:09:25,900 --> 00:09:28,067
I think

249
00:09:28,167 --> 00:09:29,467
it is all worth it

250
00:09:29,567 --> 00:09:31,933
I don't regret it and have no remorse.

251
00:09:32,033 --> 00:09:33,567
Yeah, because I'm Eri.

252
00:09:39,167 --> 00:09:41,967
The truth is when I was very little

253
00:09:42,433 --> 00:09:44,633
around the age of 9 and 10, I was...

254
00:09:44,733 --> 00:09:47,300
I was the so-called "sissy" one

255
00:09:47,400 --> 00:09:49,667
and I was bullied

256
00:09:50,400 --> 00:09:53,833
starting from then, I have kept

257
00:09:53,948 --> 00:09:55,682
hiding myself.

258
00:09:55,767 --> 00:09:58,400
(Bobo faced bullying for his expression,
resulting in his reserved personality)

259
00:09:58,500 --> 00:09:59,767
Hiding the brighter side
of me to keep it away.

260
00:09:59,867 --> 00:10:02,567
Which made me into a person

261
00:10:02,667 --> 00:10:04,267
who's more passive

262
00:10:04,367 --> 00:10:06,533
and who is not talkative.

263
00:10:06,633 --> 00:10:08,967
That's why I'm really glad

264
00:10:09,067 --> 00:10:11,833
that I'm able to meet Eri on this show.

265
00:10:11,933 --> 00:10:15,167
We talked a lot

266
00:10:15,267 --> 00:10:17,433
and he made sure that I understand

267
00:10:17,533 --> 00:10:19,233
I need to be in the present

268
00:10:19,333 --> 00:10:22,400
without considering how the future holds me

269
00:10:22,500 --> 00:10:25,067
and the past decisions I've made.

270
00:10:25,167 --> 00:10:26,800
So when I make decisions now

271
00:10:26,900 --> 00:10:29,300
I'll regret them again.

272
00:10:29,400 --> 00:10:32,700
(Thanks to Eri, Bobo starts to open
up...) That's why I really appreciate him

273
00:10:32,800 --> 00:10:34,567
for talking with me these couple of days

274
00:10:34,667 --> 00:10:35,867
I'm not gonna cry.

275
00:10:37,567 --> 00:10:40,200
(Double Room/Eri, Bobo)
I don't know. I've been convincing myself

276
00:10:40,800 --> 00:10:42,467
(back from the date in the afternoon)
that don't think too much about this.

277
00:10:42,567 --> 00:10:43,767
You mean Gino?

278
00:10:43,867 --> 00:10:46,133
Yeah, but I feel like.

279
00:10:46,233 --> 00:10:48,133
Before I came here.

280
00:10:48,233 --> 00:10:49,200
(Bobo took a look at Gino and
Guan-Yu and decided to go to his room...)

281
00:10:49,300 --> 00:10:51,200
I've already prepped myself.
Probably because it's my first time

282
00:10:51,300 --> 00:10:53,000
I feel like.

283
00:10:53,967 --> 00:10:55,667
Earlier when...

284
00:10:55,767 --> 00:10:58,400
I did the interview, I cried so hard.

285
00:10:58,500 --> 00:10:59,033
Seriously?

286
00:10:59,133 --> 00:11:00,033
Yeah?

287
00:11:00,133 --> 00:11:01,267
Why?

288
00:11:02,100 --> 00:11:03,167
You should watch it yourself.

289
00:11:03,267 --> 00:11:06,433
You'll get a better sense
if you watch it yourself.

290
00:11:06,998 --> 00:11:10,398
You'll know why I cried, anyway...

291
00:11:10,467 --> 00:11:12,733
I am really happy.

292
00:11:12,833 --> 00:11:15,167
It's good enough that I'm here.

293
00:11:15,267 --> 00:11:16,900
As long as I have fun

294
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:18,800
I just don't want to make a fool of myself

295
00:11:18,900 --> 00:11:20,333
in front of the camera.

296
00:11:20,433 --> 00:11:23,300
The point of this show

297
00:11:23,400 --> 00:11:25,367
is to film our true emotions.

298
00:11:25,467 --> 00:11:29,300
Just think of the
feelings I want to express.

299
00:11:29,400 --> 00:11:30,967
(Bobo is scared of getting hurt by
telling the truth...) simply as a joke.

300
00:11:31,067 --> 00:11:32,067
It's not a joke

301
00:11:32,167 --> 00:11:35,067
I'm done with it. I just want to go home.

302
00:11:35,167 --> 00:11:36,167
No, it's hard to say...

303
00:11:36,267 --> 00:11:37,767
If I stay any longer

304
00:11:37,867 --> 00:11:40,100
I'll get more upset

305
00:11:40,200 --> 00:11:42,267
I don't think so

306
00:11:42,367 --> 00:11:43,967
I want to cry.

307
00:11:45,367 --> 00:11:46,500
Why?

308
00:11:47,800 --> 00:11:50,967
Because I think what I did is ridiculous

309
00:11:51,067 --> 00:11:52,633
I don't think that.

310
00:11:53,310 --> 00:11:54,006
Not at all.

311
00:11:54,031 --> 00:11:57,152
(Unleashing emotions suppressed for years,
feeling overwhelmed by the transformation)

312
00:11:58,400 --> 00:11:59,233
Let me hug you.

313
00:12:01,567 --> 00:12:05,167
(A genuine hug is worth
more than a thousand words...)

314
00:12:11,100 --> 00:12:13,267
Alright, I'll tell you the reason I cried.

315
00:12:13,367 --> 00:12:14,533
Didn't you say.

316
00:12:14,633 --> 00:12:17,300
Didn't I mention that I am really happy?

317
00:12:17,376 --> 00:12:19,843
I was saying that I was really happy

318
00:12:19,967 --> 00:12:21,767
when filming this show

319
00:12:21,867 --> 00:12:25,000
I got to have a special friend.

320
00:12:25,100 --> 00:12:27,500
Yeah, it's a blessing to know you

321
00:12:27,600 --> 00:12:29,500
and it made me wanna cry so hard.

322
00:12:30,567 --> 00:12:34,700
Having you makes me really happy
so I cried.

323
00:12:37,133 --> 00:12:40,567
Despite the joining of new members
or new choices

324
00:12:40,667 --> 00:12:41,767
or whether the final ending

325
00:12:41,867 --> 00:12:43,867
is the result we want

326
00:12:43,967 --> 00:12:45,300
I feel like we both already

327
00:12:45,400 --> 00:12:47,233
get what we want.

328
00:12:53,267 --> 00:12:54,667
I'm so stupid.

329
00:12:54,767 --> 00:12:57,633
Not at all, I feel like you'll be glad

330
00:12:57,733 --> 00:12:59,333
when you see this in the future.

331
00:12:59,433 --> 00:13:03,533
To explore this genuine side of you

332
00:13:03,633 --> 00:13:06,200
I couldn't even tell you
what I like about him

333
00:13:06,300 --> 00:13:08,767
I'm genuinely clueless.

334
00:13:08,867 --> 00:13:10,767
But that's how affection works.

335
00:13:10,867 --> 00:13:13,733
If you can tell me exactly why

336
00:13:14,200 --> 00:13:15,900
then you only like certain places

337
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:16,700
certain places of him.

338
00:13:16,800 --> 00:13:17,933
(Eri told Bobo that enjoying the
present moment is the priority)

339
00:13:18,033 --> 00:13:20,500
Therefore, whether you like him or not

340
00:13:20,600 --> 00:13:24,100
whether he chooses you or not
it's not that important

341
00:13:24,200 --> 00:13:27,200
I believe it is more important to enjoy

342
00:13:27,300 --> 00:13:29,600
and to have fun in the future.

343
00:13:33,133 --> 00:13:36,400
Yeah, that's all
or else I'm gonna cry.

344
00:13:38,900 --> 00:13:40,250
You can go to the bathroom
for some time alone.

345
00:13:40,275 --> 00:13:42,696
(Overwhelmed with emotions,
Bobo couldn't hold back the tears)

346
00:13:42,804 --> 00:13:45,067
Yeah, feel free to take some time alone.

347
00:13:45,167 --> 00:13:47,200
You know, I had fun.

348
00:13:47,300 --> 00:13:50,567
These couple of days are worth it.

349
00:13:52,767 --> 00:13:55,367
Eri and I talked in our room

350
00:13:55,467 --> 00:13:58,433
that what this journey means to us.

351
00:13:58,533 --> 00:14:00,233
What is the most important thing?

352
00:14:00,333 --> 00:14:02,533
That's why I'd rather grasp

353
00:14:02,633 --> 00:14:04,600
the friendship I have with Eri.

354
00:14:04,700 --> 00:14:06,333
At least

355
00:14:06,433 --> 00:14:08,733
I've taken home something with me

356
00:14:08,833 --> 00:14:11,033
instead of having nothing with me.

357
00:14:11,400 --> 00:14:12,367
Well, I had so much fun

358
00:14:12,467 --> 00:14:15,600
because I got two things with me today.

359
00:14:15,700 --> 00:14:17,867
Yesterday, I was in
love for a couple of hours

360
00:14:17,967 --> 00:14:20,000
taking a walk with NIO.

361
00:14:20,100 --> 00:14:22,900
And I got something more
valuable, which is Bobo

362
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:24,367
no matter what happens

363
00:14:24,467 --> 00:14:26,800
I'm gonna keep in touch with him.

364
00:14:28,400 --> 00:14:30,800
Alright, who's turn for
their Oscar's speech?

365
00:14:30,900 --> 00:14:31,900
I can do it.

366
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:33,233
Your turn it is.

367
00:14:33,333 --> 00:14:34,533
About regret and remorse

368
00:14:34,633 --> 00:14:35,767
just like you

369
00:14:35,867 --> 00:14:37,633
I don't have any remorse

370
00:14:37,733 --> 00:14:38,867
in my life basically.

371
00:14:38,967 --> 00:14:40,533
Mainly because for me

372
00:14:40,633 --> 00:14:43,633
I've almost made every important decision

373
00:14:44,367 --> 00:14:45,367
on my own.

374
00:14:45,467 --> 00:14:48,900
Every move was my idea.

375
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:50,100
(Hearing each unique story, Gino got
emotional) Essentially, there was no remorse

376
00:14:50,200 --> 00:14:52,567
(tearing up)
But I do regret one more thing.

377
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:57,700
My father is 82 years old this year

378
00:14:57,800 --> 00:15:00,767
which is pretty old.

379
00:15:00,867 --> 00:15:03,500
And I often wonder

380
00:15:03,600 --> 00:15:05,000
if it's the last time

381
00:15:05,100 --> 00:15:08,133
I get to say happy birthday to him.

382
00:15:08,233 --> 00:15:10,333
Anyway, I regret that

383
00:15:10,433 --> 00:15:13,300
these couple of years

384
00:15:13,400 --> 00:15:15,533
I didn't spend a lot of time with my dad.

385
00:15:15,633 --> 00:15:17,100
That's all, yeah.

386
00:15:17,200 --> 00:15:20,062
This is also my lesson to learn.
how to balance this.

387
00:15:20,087 --> 00:15:22,455
(NIO is worried about the regrets of not spending
enough time with his family)

388
00:15:23,033 --> 00:15:24,533
The time I spend with him

389
00:15:24,633 --> 00:15:26,867
and the time I spent in Taipei.

390
00:15:26,967 --> 00:15:30,367
Personally, my experience
is the opposite of NIO's.

391
00:15:30,467 --> 00:15:33,600
A lot of my life decisions for me

392
00:15:33,700 --> 00:15:35,100
I have regrets

393
00:15:35,200 --> 00:15:39,333
because I didn't learn
how to connect with people

394
00:15:39,433 --> 00:15:41,400
ever since I was little.

395
00:15:41,500 --> 00:15:42,833
Therefore, plenty of my life decisions

396
00:15:42,933 --> 00:15:46,100
were made by my parents

397
00:15:46,200 --> 00:15:50,100
I want to make a
breakthrough through this show

398
00:15:50,200 --> 00:15:52,633
especially socializing.

399
00:15:52,733 --> 00:15:54,733
That is my weakness.

400
00:15:54,833 --> 00:15:56,767
So a lot of times

401
00:15:56,867 --> 00:16:00,400
the conversations between me
and other people often end up

402
00:16:00,500 --> 00:16:02,433
like a mismatched puzzle.

403
00:16:02,533 --> 00:16:04,333
This kind of regret

404
00:16:04,433 --> 00:16:07,533
offers me an opportunity
in dating like this.

405
00:16:07,633 --> 00:16:08,533
(Susu wants to overcome his social anxiety
by joining the show) to do the so-called

406
00:16:08,633 --> 00:16:10,500
socializing show with lots of you guys

407
00:16:10,600 --> 00:16:14,067
as a way to make up this void.

408
00:16:14,167 --> 00:16:14,700
Stop that.

409
00:16:14,800 --> 00:16:17,433
Mismatched puzzles always
end up being the perfect one.

410
00:16:17,533 --> 00:16:18,867
It's all good.

411
00:16:19,500 --> 00:16:22,333
Well, there is no similar opportunity

412
00:16:22,433 --> 00:16:23,867
like this in my life

413
00:16:23,967 --> 00:16:25,967
living with everyone

414
00:16:26,067 --> 00:16:31,933
getting along with each other very well.

415
00:16:32,033 --> 00:16:35,167
Besides, I'm quite comfortable
with the whole process

416
00:16:35,267 --> 00:16:38,367
without any huge burdens
weighing on my shoulders.

417
00:16:38,933 --> 00:16:40,633
Experiences like mine

418
00:16:40,733 --> 00:16:45,267
would be the time starting
from the age of 9 to college

419
00:16:45,367 --> 00:16:48,533
people constantly bullied me

420
00:16:48,633 --> 00:16:53,233
I was afraid to connect with people

421
00:16:53,333 --> 00:16:55,233
especially with a group of people.

422
00:16:55,333 --> 00:16:56,333
Like now, you mean?

423
00:16:56,433 --> 00:16:57,267
Like now.

424
00:16:57,367 --> 00:16:59,667
To be honest,
I was terrified of something like this

425
00:16:59,767 --> 00:17:02,533
and I'd start to put my guard up

426
00:17:02,633 --> 00:17:07,367
or to make myself more annoying

427
00:17:07,467 --> 00:17:09,633
so that people wouldn't approach me.

428
00:17:09,733 --> 00:17:10,900
That's why for a while

429
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:12,433
I was using sex

430
00:17:12,533 --> 00:17:14,667
sex with lots of people

431
00:17:14,767 --> 00:17:16,600
to prove that I existed.

432
00:17:16,700 --> 00:17:19,733
(Gino couldn't hold his tears any
longer...) that I was not someone very tiny.

433
00:17:19,833 --> 00:17:22,233
And I lived like this for quite some time.

434
00:17:22,333 --> 00:17:25,767
Until a few years ago

435
00:17:25,867 --> 00:17:28,200
I started to go on medication,

436
00:17:28,300 --> 00:17:33,167
so my regrets are basically, having no idea

437
00:17:33,267 --> 00:17:35,033
how to reconcile with my younger self

438
00:17:35,133 --> 00:17:37,800
never in my imagination did I think
I needed to do something like this.

439
00:17:37,900 --> 00:17:40,033
Every time I thought about it
I ran away

440
00:17:40,133 --> 00:17:41,233
I was using alcohol

441
00:17:41,333 --> 00:17:44,867
and by prescriptions to live

442
00:17:44,967 --> 00:17:46,267
and to run away.

443
00:17:46,367 --> 00:17:47,467
(Jia-Hang couldn't make
peace with his past self...)

444
00:17:47,567 --> 00:17:50,033
Whenever these issues come up,
those two are my go-to coping skills.

445
00:17:50,140 --> 00:17:53,240
But running away isn't
necessarily a bad thing.

446
00:17:53,333 --> 00:17:55,433
If you can't face it right now

447
00:17:55,533 --> 00:17:56,800
then run away

448
00:17:56,900 --> 00:17:59,367
I think that would be the best for you.

449
00:17:59,467 --> 00:18:01,100
That also doesn't mean you aren't able

450
00:18:01,200 --> 00:18:02,567
to figure it out later.

451
00:18:02,667 --> 00:18:04,033
During the process

452
00:18:04,133 --> 00:18:06,067
if that makes it easier for you

453
00:18:06,167 --> 00:18:08,667
I don't believe that is a regret.

454
00:18:08,767 --> 00:18:10,233
That's what I think now.

455
00:18:10,333 --> 00:18:12,900
Just accept who you are.

456
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:15,100
It's more important to be happy.

457
00:18:29,467 --> 00:18:31,600
I'm speechless and I don't know what to say

458
00:18:31,700 --> 00:18:32,733
even though I have a lot to say

459
00:18:32,833 --> 00:18:35,100
I'm speechless now.

460
00:18:36,767 --> 00:18:38,433
Wait till you're comfortable.

461
00:18:39,600 --> 00:18:41,267
Is this salty to you guys?

462
00:18:41,367 --> 00:18:42,233
It is.

463
00:18:50,233 --> 00:18:53,967
(Why is Gino so emotional...?)

464
00:19:01,351 --> 00:19:03,351
The time spent together
in the past four days,

465
00:19:03,467 --> 00:19:06,633
the most magical thing for me

466
00:19:07,600 --> 00:19:11,200
is the fact I am able to pour out my heart

467
00:19:11,300 --> 00:19:14,200
deep inside of me without an effort

468
00:19:14,300 --> 00:19:17,200
I think that's because everyone
is genuinely straightforward.

469
00:19:17,300 --> 00:19:23,600
To unapologetically share their stories

470
00:19:23,700 --> 00:19:24,833
whether it's good or bad

471
00:19:24,933 --> 00:19:27,433
so I'm also blessed

472
00:19:27,533 --> 00:19:29,267
getting to know you guys.

473
00:19:29,367 --> 00:19:31,533
(Gino explains the reason he was
so emotional) hearing so many stories.

474
00:19:31,633 --> 00:19:34,167
That touches me.

475
00:19:34,267 --> 00:19:37,300
It touches a deeper side of me

476
00:19:37,400 --> 00:19:41,733
and I get to share it to comfort myself.

477
00:19:42,300 --> 00:19:46,733
As for the regrets, honestly

478
00:19:46,833 --> 00:19:48,167
if I shrink it down

479
00:19:48,267 --> 00:19:50,200
to the size of our eight people

480
00:19:50,300 --> 00:19:52,967
I don't know who is leaving today

481
00:19:53,067 --> 00:19:56,333
but at this present moment.

482
00:19:57,267 --> 00:19:59,300
I have something to say to Bobo.

483
00:19:59,400 --> 00:20:02,067
The reason why I want to say something

484
00:20:02,167 --> 00:20:04,167
is because, no matter what the reason is

485
00:20:04,267 --> 00:20:06,300
I feel like if I don't say it

486
00:20:06,400 --> 00:20:08,533
I may just wake up tomorrow

487
00:20:08,633 --> 00:20:09,600
thinking that it is fine

488
00:20:09,700 --> 00:20:11,333
life is full of choices, anyways.

489
00:20:11,433 --> 00:20:13,767
But facing this situation at hand,

490
00:20:13,867 --> 00:20:16,333
(Gino decided to own up his confusion
towards Bobo What happened between them...?)

491
00:20:16,433 --> 00:20:19,967
I choose to say this out loud and
decided not to leave any regrets.

492
00:20:20,300 --> 00:20:21,100
You can go in.

493
00:20:21,867 --> 00:20:24,000
(Earlier, after they got back to the
cabin from the date) He is so dramatic.

494
00:20:27,167 --> 00:20:30,967
(After Bobo got back, Gino wanted to talk to him)

495
00:20:36,633 --> 00:20:39,367
He was here and asked if I could talk.

496
00:20:39,467 --> 00:20:40,567
(Double Room/Eri, Bobo)
Who?

497
00:20:40,667 --> 00:20:41,500
Who would it be?

498
00:20:41,600 --> 00:20:42,500
You mean your crush?

499
00:20:42,600 --> 00:20:44,333
Yeah, and I was like.

500
00:20:44,433 --> 00:20:45,967
What was he wanting to talk about?

501
00:20:46,067 --> 00:20:47,667
(But Bobo refused to talk with Gino
privately...) Talk to him. Why didn't you?

502
00:20:47,767 --> 00:20:48,867
I had no interest in that.

503
00:20:48,967 --> 00:20:50,000
And? You said no?

504
00:20:50,100 --> 00:20:52,733
I said no and I went
straight to the bathroom.

505
00:20:52,833 --> 00:20:54,200
Now, let's unravel the layers.

506
00:20:54,300 --> 00:20:55,900
(Gino seeks the advice of
other members after the rejection)

507
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:59,767
I'm genuinely so confused. And I
have to say I was trying to talk to Bobo

508
00:20:59,867 --> 00:21:02,300
but he refused.

509
00:21:02,400 --> 00:21:04,533
No way, Bobo didn't
even bother to talk to you?

510
00:21:04,633 --> 00:21:06,467
When we went in there, he said

511
00:21:06,567 --> 00:21:09,533
he wanted to leave today if that's possible

512
00:21:09,633 --> 00:21:11,100
I was like

513
00:21:11,200 --> 00:21:12,667
why would he have this reaction?

514
00:21:12,767 --> 00:21:14,400
What happened?

515
00:21:19,167 --> 00:21:22,300
(What was Bobo exactly thinking...?)

516
00:21:22,751 --> 00:21:24,384
I mean.

517
00:21:25,333 --> 00:21:28,200
(Gino gathered up his
courage to talk it out with Bobo)

518
00:21:28,300 --> 00:21:29,800
How about I go to the bathroom.

519
00:21:29,900 --> 00:21:31,800
Well, Bobo.

520
00:21:31,900 --> 00:21:33,167
Don't move. This is for you.

521
00:21:33,267 --> 00:21:34,600
Sit tight.

522
00:21:37,167 --> 00:21:39,200
Actually, it's fine because...

523
00:21:39,300 --> 00:21:40,333
Yeah.

524
00:21:41,500 --> 00:21:42,467
Yeah.

525
00:21:44,300 --> 00:21:46,100
I mean, we talked a lot earlier

526
00:21:46,200 --> 00:21:48,300
about our own stuff

527
00:21:48,400 --> 00:21:50,600
I think you guys can talk it out.

528
00:21:50,700 --> 00:21:53,867
We shared a lot on the day we rode horses

529
00:21:53,967 --> 00:21:55,600
I want to say to you that

530
00:21:55,700 --> 00:21:58,633
I appreciate what you shared with me.

531
00:21:58,733 --> 00:22:03,433
Like diving, and sharing
some moments that happened

532
00:22:03,533 --> 00:22:05,333
in your life

533
00:22:05,433 --> 00:22:08,000
I think you must trust me a lot

534
00:22:08,100 --> 00:22:11,700
to share that kind of stuff with me.

535
00:22:12,267 --> 00:22:13,367
What I'm saying is that

536
00:22:13,467 --> 00:22:18,500
we're gonna spend six days together
in this show

537
00:22:18,600 --> 00:22:19,767
but there are a lot of

538
00:22:19,867 --> 00:22:22,900
six days and even six years in our life.

539
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:24,533
Even sixty years.

540
00:22:24,633 --> 00:22:25,300
If it's alright

541
00:22:25,400 --> 00:22:31,300
we can be really close friends.

542
00:22:32,633 --> 00:22:34,867
Yeah, it's not something that shallow.

543
00:22:34,967 --> 00:22:36,633
Not something that is already fated forever

544
00:22:36,733 --> 00:22:38,567
during these six days

545
00:22:38,667 --> 00:22:40,533
including everyone here.

546
00:22:40,633 --> 00:22:42,533
Okay, thank you, guys

547
00:22:44,233 --> 00:22:47,033
(everyone claps for his
courage to speak his mind)

548
00:22:48,833 --> 00:22:52,633
(Guan-Yu seems to be
contemplating after Gino's sharing)

549
00:22:55,167 --> 00:22:57,500
Gosh, you are popular.

550
00:22:57,600 --> 00:22:57,967
Am I?

551
00:22:58,067 --> 00:22:59,667
(Before dinner, Gino, NIO, and Shih-Feng
were chatting) Gino, you are popular.

552
00:22:59,767 --> 00:23:01,867
Guan-Yu has a crush on you.

553
00:23:01,967 --> 00:23:04,867
No, I think he is confused

554
00:23:04,967 --> 00:23:05,833
I don't think so.

555
00:23:05,933 --> 00:23:09,367
Doesn't he? I think he is confused

556
00:23:09,467 --> 00:23:12,033
I feel like I'm not his first choice

557
00:23:12,133 --> 00:23:13,500
I mean, he is like me

558
00:23:13,600 --> 00:23:15,367
we are confused.

559
00:23:16,467 --> 00:23:17,100
I don't know why

560
00:23:17,200 --> 00:23:20,133
unlike the certainty between Eri and Bobo.

561
00:23:20,233 --> 00:23:22,567
(Guan-Yu hesitated before he chose his
partner) Like it's a match, you're the one.

562
00:23:22,667 --> 00:23:24,667
Let's go on a trip.

563
00:23:24,767 --> 00:23:28,133
(Question/Who is Guan-Yu first choice?)
Perhaps Susu? I have no idea

564
00:23:28,500 --> 00:23:30,000
I think I need a minute.

565
00:23:30,100 --> 00:23:33,500
If everyone is being that friendly

566
00:23:33,600 --> 00:23:38,800
I don't have time to think about
everyone's feelings toward me.

567
00:23:38,900 --> 00:23:41,600
Plus, I don't want to get too
overwhelmed by the rush

568
00:23:41,700 --> 00:23:43,633
and face someone's feelings toward me.

569
00:23:47,967 --> 00:23:50,400
Do you want to share? Or...

570
00:23:50,867 --> 00:23:54,467
I'm a little... I just don't
really know what to say.

571
00:23:55,400 --> 00:23:57,067
There are so many things happening.

572
00:23:57,167 --> 00:23:59,800
During dinner time

573
00:23:59,892 --> 00:24:03,025
I'm not ready to communicate with everyone.

574
00:24:03,133 --> 00:24:05,067
A feeling suddenly came over me

575
00:24:05,167 --> 00:24:08,000
telling me I need to be quiet for a while.

576
00:24:09,161 --> 00:24:13,267
I'm scared to say the wrong thing

577
00:24:13,367 --> 00:24:16,133
and I've suddenly realized

578
00:24:16,233 --> 00:24:19,433
that a lot of people are sharing the space.

579
00:24:20,067 --> 00:24:21,667
Well, enjoy your dinner

580
00:24:21,767 --> 00:24:23,967
I bet this episode should
also be quite exciting.

581
00:24:24,833 --> 00:24:26,033
I'm sure I won't get eliminated

582
00:24:26,133 --> 00:24:28,000
since I speak so eloquently.

583
00:24:29,300 --> 00:24:30,733
It won't be fair to get rid of me.

584
00:24:30,833 --> 00:24:33,033
Or your show is gonna be really lame.

585
00:24:34,400 --> 00:24:42,800
(Now, the contestants still
have no idea who will leave)

586
00:24:46,400 --> 00:24:50,600
(What more would happen tonight...)

587
00:24:51,467 --> 00:24:55,167
(Double Room/Susu, Jia-Hang)

588
00:24:55,267 --> 00:24:57,000
What?

589
00:24:57,100 --> 00:24:58,233
To see what you're doing.

590
00:24:58,333 --> 00:24:59,333
We are...

591
00:24:59,433 --> 00:25:01,233
He is sleeping and I'm watching Youtube.

592
00:25:01,333 --> 00:25:02,700
Wanna hang out with me?

593
00:25:02,800 --> 00:25:05,033
Sure.

594
00:25:06,167 --> 00:25:07,167
Exhausted?

595
00:25:07,267 --> 00:25:08,033
(Bobo came to hang out
with Susu and Jia-Hang)

596
00:25:08,133 --> 00:25:09,633
- Not really.
- What did you guys do today?

597
00:25:09,733 --> 00:25:11,167
You mean over here?

598
00:25:11,267 --> 00:25:13,033
You guys really didn't go out?

599
00:25:13,133 --> 00:25:14,333
Yeah, we were staying at this site.

600
00:25:14,433 --> 00:25:15,633
Wandering around the site all-day.

601
00:25:15,733 --> 00:25:16,967
Yeah.

602
00:25:17,067 --> 00:25:19,100
Did something happen?

603
00:25:19,200 --> 00:25:21,533
Well, we talked about

604
00:25:22,067 --> 00:25:23,667
some of the gossip.

605
00:25:24,867 --> 00:25:27,733
NIO shared some of his stories

606
00:25:27,833 --> 00:25:29,667
about what happened yesterday.

607
00:25:29,767 --> 00:25:32,133
So he didn't say what his choice was today?

608
00:25:32,233 --> 00:25:34,133
He didn't say it... not even a word.

609
00:25:34,241 --> 00:25:36,241
And he is annoying... I...

610
00:25:36,333 --> 00:25:38,200
Because if he did choose Eri.

611
00:25:38,300 --> 00:25:39,700
Eri wouldn't have chosen me

612
00:25:39,800 --> 00:25:42,233
I know... because I just talked to Eri.

613
00:25:42,333 --> 00:25:43,333
- Really?
- Yeah.

614
00:25:43,900 --> 00:25:45,767
Then who did you choose today?

615
00:25:49,667 --> 00:25:52,533
We chose the same person.

616
00:25:52,633 --> 00:25:53,133
Yeah.

617
00:25:53,233 --> 00:25:53,767
Guan-Yu.

618
00:25:53,867 --> 00:25:55,800
It's not Gino, right.

619
00:25:55,900 --> 00:25:56,667
We both chose him.

620
00:25:56,767 --> 00:25:57,967
Can I just spill it out?

621
00:25:58,067 --> 00:26:01,267
Yeah, but our reasons are different

622
00:26:01,367 --> 00:26:03,067
I want to drop out of the game

623
00:26:03,167 --> 00:26:06,267
so I chose someone the most unlikely.

624
00:26:06,367 --> 00:26:07,600
Why?

625
00:26:08,100 --> 00:26:11,767
Well, that's the way it is.

626
00:26:11,867 --> 00:26:14,500
Why do you want to drop out?

627
00:26:14,600 --> 00:26:15,167
Because I feel like

628
00:26:15,267 --> 00:26:17,767
everyone already has their own crush.

629
00:26:17,858 --> 00:26:20,191
Plus, coming here on
the second day is at a loss.

630
00:26:20,300 --> 00:26:22,900
Despite the fact

631
00:26:23,000 --> 00:26:26,867
that I didn't want to compete

632
00:26:26,967 --> 00:26:28,733
and I feel like.

633
00:26:28,833 --> 00:26:30,467
(Jia-Hang revealed that
he lost his will to fight)

634
00:26:30,567 --> 00:26:34,733
It is nice enough to get to know everyone.
Romantically, just never mind then

635
00:26:34,833 --> 00:26:37,833
I chose him because
he was the least possible one

636
00:26:37,933 --> 00:26:41,167
as long as I can get out of this safely.

637
00:26:41,267 --> 00:26:42,933
Yeah, mine is kind of different from yours.

638
00:26:43,033 --> 00:26:45,167
Yeah, it is indeed different

639
00:26:45,267 --> 00:26:47,667
I just wanted to have
more conversations with him.

640
00:26:48,367 --> 00:26:50,200
My reason is simple

641
00:26:50,300 --> 00:26:53,033
I already lost my chance.

642
00:26:53,133 --> 00:26:54,667
So forget it.

643
00:26:54,767 --> 00:26:56,767
(Bobo expresses his upset feelings)
Why? You mean your crush?

644
00:26:56,867 --> 00:26:58,333
Yeah.

645
00:26:59,533 --> 00:27:01,733
Don't leave
Don't even think about packing.

646
00:27:01,833 --> 00:27:03,633
But I really want to go home.

647
00:27:03,733 --> 00:27:04,967
- You can't.
- I'm exhausted.

648
00:27:05,067 --> 00:27:07,400
You can't compete with me for this spot
It was my spot.

649
00:27:07,500 --> 00:27:08,700
No way.

650
00:27:08,800 --> 00:27:11,767
You can stay and keep going
in different directions.

651
00:27:11,867 --> 00:27:13,467
Don't give out. Stay

652
00:27:13,567 --> 00:27:15,100
I'll hang out with you later on.

653
00:27:15,933 --> 00:27:17,900
I don't know. It's just...

654
00:27:18,733 --> 00:27:21,000
See how things will play out.

655
00:27:23,433 --> 00:27:24,367
Awkward.

656
00:27:24,467 --> 00:27:27,667
Our audience can tell
this easily. Why suffer?

657
00:27:27,767 --> 00:27:30,233
- Then don't. Don't do this for the audience.
- Yeah.

658
00:27:30,333 --> 00:27:31,200
Stay for yourself.

659
00:27:31,300 --> 00:27:33,900
Enjoy your stay here for the next few days.

660
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:35,833
Think of it this way.

661
00:27:35,933 --> 00:27:38,167
You rarely get this type of chance

662
00:27:38,267 --> 00:27:39,833
to join this show

663
00:27:39,925 --> 00:27:41,259
and hang out with everyone

664
00:27:41,367 --> 00:27:42,233
with a nice schedule.

665
00:27:42,333 --> 00:27:44,633
Yeah, I'm grateful for this chance.

666
00:27:44,733 --> 00:27:46,433
Yeah, so...

667
00:27:46,533 --> 00:27:48,600
Of course it's better if I can stay.

668
00:27:59,464 --> 00:28:04,464
(The moment when someone
will leave the cabin has arrived...)

669
00:28:04,790 --> 00:28:09,056
(Boys Like Boys)

670
00:28:09,535 --> 00:28:16,301
(Who will leave the cabin tonight?)

671
00:28:33,333 --> 00:28:37,238
(If these are the last words of this
journey, take the recorder with your name

672
00:28:37,262 --> 00:28:41,167
on it and answer: If today were my last
day, what would I want to say to everyone?)

673
00:28:46,933 --> 00:28:50,533
(NIO, Susu)

674
00:28:56,433 --> 00:29:00,267
(a rare moment of solitude)

675
00:29:00,367 --> 00:29:06,267
(recording all the
things on their minds)

676
00:29:06,367 --> 00:29:10,500
(Memories keep flooding back)

677
00:29:10,600 --> 00:29:15,600
(Can the unspoken words
be spoken without regrets?)

678
00:29:15,700 --> 00:29:18,133
Hi, everyone, this is NIO.

679
00:29:18,233 --> 00:29:20,767
What I would like to say.

680
00:29:21,567 --> 00:29:25,500
It truly has been a great honor

681
00:29:25,600 --> 00:29:27,300
to be able to meet

682
00:29:27,400 --> 00:29:31,467
seven of you, who are incredible.

683
00:29:31,567 --> 00:29:35,367
It's not easy to take
part in this kind of show.

684
00:29:35,467 --> 00:29:37,933
Everyone seems to be saying it a lot

685
00:29:38,033 --> 00:29:40,267
but somehow, I've never
said it out loud before

686
00:29:40,367 --> 00:29:41,700
because, after all, I'm quite shy

687
00:29:41,800 --> 00:29:44,800
I really like you guys.

688
00:29:46,700 --> 00:29:49,433
To a point I have this illusion

689
00:29:49,533 --> 00:29:50,967
that it seems like

690
00:29:51,067 --> 00:29:55,167
I live in this amazing environment.

691
00:29:55,267 --> 00:29:57,867
It makes me want to keep

692
00:29:57,967 --> 00:29:59,767
staying with you all.

693
00:29:59,874 --> 00:30:02,307
And I'm really happy

694
00:30:02,400 --> 00:30:05,233
that I get to be who I am.

695
00:30:05,333 --> 00:30:07,100
You guys are so welcoming

696
00:30:07,200 --> 00:30:10,167
and accept my insecurity.

697
00:30:10,900 --> 00:30:12,667
With the eight of us gathering here

698
00:30:12,783 --> 00:30:15,383
there must be some connection

699
00:30:15,467 --> 00:30:17,433
to get us all here.

700
00:30:17,533 --> 00:30:20,633
Even though falling in love
is our first intention

701
00:30:20,733 --> 00:30:24,867
we have to learn to love ourselves

702
00:30:24,967 --> 00:30:27,567
before falling in love with anyone else.

703
00:30:27,667 --> 00:30:29,567
Also, I'm grateful

704
00:30:29,667 --> 00:30:32,733
that I could be with you along the way.

705
00:30:32,833 --> 00:30:37,833
Please never lose your
confidence and courage.

706
00:30:37,933 --> 00:30:40,367
Every one of you is perfect.

707
00:30:40,467 --> 00:30:44,533
You don't need anyone
or anything to validate you

708
00:30:44,633 --> 00:30:46,933
or even to prove anything.

709
00:30:47,033 --> 00:30:50,267
You are already perfect

710
00:30:50,367 --> 00:30:54,000
I believe we can all take home
something valuable

711
00:30:54,100 --> 00:30:58,700
and to be someone who loves ourselves

712
00:30:58,800 --> 00:31:00,867
even more bravely.

713
00:31:00,967 --> 00:31:02,633
Meeting you guys is my honor

714
00:31:02,733 --> 00:31:04,967
and I also like

715
00:31:05,067 --> 00:31:07,333
getting to know you
guys in this environment.

716
00:31:07,433 --> 00:31:10,567
Hope that our lives
can overlap in the future

717
00:31:10,667 --> 00:31:15,133
or have the chance to be reunited.

718
00:31:15,233 --> 00:31:18,367
See you guys soon

719
00:31:18,467 --> 00:31:20,733
and let's have a drink together.

720
00:31:20,833 --> 00:31:22,467
Thank you, guys.

721
00:31:24,567 --> 00:31:25,700
I'd appreciate it.

722
00:31:33,533 --> 00:31:36,600
(Question/What if you are the one leaving today?)
I... I mean, I'm not worried about leaving

723
00:31:36,700 --> 00:31:37,767
I don't worry about that.

724
00:31:37,867 --> 00:31:40,633
Yeah, but I don't think I will leave.

725
00:31:45,433 --> 00:31:46,500
(Question/What if you
are the one leaving today?)

726
00:31:46,600 --> 00:31:48,267
It's hard to let go

727
00:31:48,367 --> 00:31:50,967
but I guess there are no regrets.

728
00:31:51,067 --> 00:31:53,267
After all, this is a hell of a journey.

729
00:31:57,967 --> 00:31:59,193
(Question/What if you're
the one leaving today?)

730
00:31:59,217 --> 00:32:03,580
I'm cool when I think of it as a way
to meet people. It's been fun to join

731
00:32:03,604 --> 00:32:07,967
this show and have this opportunity
I think this show is worth my while.

732
00:32:08,417 --> 00:32:10,884
Well, it would be nice to
see each other after filming.

733
00:32:11,000 --> 00:32:12,900
Maybe we can create a group chat

734
00:32:13,000 --> 00:32:15,600
and we can hang out, yeah.

735
00:32:29,400 --> 00:32:31,933
I'm Eri.

736
00:32:32,033 --> 00:32:36,133
It's been fun these couple of days.

737
00:32:38,433 --> 00:32:39,967
Thanks, Bobo.

738
00:32:40,067 --> 00:32:41,667
Bobo, I love you.

739
00:32:41,767 --> 00:32:44,067
But my kind of love towards you is friendship.

740
00:32:44,167 --> 00:32:47,633
During these three days
no one can surpass you.

741
00:32:49,033 --> 00:32:50,300
A special thanks to Eri

742
00:32:50,400 --> 00:32:53,467
I think you're my biggest blessing

743
00:32:53,567 --> 00:32:55,133
during my journey here.

744
00:32:55,233 --> 00:32:57,233
Honestly, in the beginning

745
00:32:57,333 --> 00:33:00,100
as expected, I put my guard up.

746
00:33:00,800 --> 00:33:02,400
After I put my guard up

747
00:33:02,500 --> 00:33:04,200
because of you, I was able to

748
00:33:04,300 --> 00:33:06,933
smash my walls down

749
00:33:07,033 --> 00:33:09,267
and therefore I can experience

750
00:33:09,367 --> 00:33:11,533
these heartfelt moments.

751
00:33:12,200 --> 00:33:16,733
Next, I still wanna say something to NIO.

752
00:33:17,800 --> 00:33:20,967
I don't know why I have
a serious crush on you.

753
00:33:21,067 --> 00:33:23,200
The moment you helped me with my luggage

754
00:33:23,300 --> 00:33:26,333
I had an instinct that
I was gonna like you.

755
00:33:27,567 --> 00:33:31,567
And in the next three days,
it ended up validating my instinct

756
00:33:31,667 --> 00:33:33,133
I don't know where the future holds us

757
00:33:33,233 --> 00:33:38,033
but hanging out with you guys and Bobo

758
00:33:38,133 --> 00:33:40,633
I'm very grateful

759
00:33:40,733 --> 00:33:43,300
and I love you both very much
I'd appreciate it.

760
00:33:45,900 --> 00:33:50,633
Next, I'd like to express
my gratitude toward Gino.

761
00:33:50,733 --> 00:33:54,067
Though some of our
interactions have led me on

762
00:33:54,167 --> 00:33:55,967
causing some misunderstandings

763
00:33:56,067 --> 00:33:58,333
but I still don't regret

764
00:33:58,433 --> 00:34:00,933
what I said on the third day.

765
00:34:01,033 --> 00:34:02,867
Because when we were in the car

766
00:34:02,967 --> 00:34:04,700
I already wanted to tell you these.

767
00:34:04,800 --> 00:34:05,367
You were starving.

768
00:34:05,467 --> 00:34:08,433
Because my ideal roommate was my opponent.

769
00:34:13,000 --> 00:34:14,267
I'm glad I said it.

770
00:34:14,367 --> 00:34:16,173
(With the possible leaving,
he wants to get things straight)

771
00:34:16,198 --> 00:34:19,400
If there's a chance, I'd like us
to be friends. Let's keep in touch.

772
00:34:19,500 --> 00:34:22,233
Well, you know

773
00:34:22,333 --> 00:34:23,733
I said I wanted to go home

774
00:34:23,833 --> 00:34:26,733
but the truth is
I want to keep hanging out with you.

775
00:34:26,833 --> 00:34:28,867
And I want to thank you all

776
00:34:28,967 --> 00:34:31,567
for giving me positive energy.

777
00:34:32,833 --> 00:34:36,400
Like I said earlier

778
00:34:36,500 --> 00:34:38,433
if my journey ends today

779
00:34:38,533 --> 00:34:40,033
I'd like to tell everyone

780
00:34:40,133 --> 00:34:41,767
that even though this show ends

781
00:34:41,867 --> 00:34:45,033
it's a fresh start of our new journey.

782
00:34:46,433 --> 00:34:47,567
Slogan.

783
00:34:47,667 --> 00:34:49,467
Slogan, excellent.

784
00:34:49,900 --> 00:34:52,433
Thanks, bye.

785
00:34:57,633 --> 00:35:00,633
During the show, I've learned
how to live in the moment.

786
00:35:00,733 --> 00:35:01,933
If I'm leaving today

787
00:35:02,033 --> 00:35:03,933
I wouldn't have any regrets.

788
00:35:36,600 --> 00:35:39,367
Hi, everyone, I'm Guan-Yu.

789
00:35:41,933 --> 00:35:46,267
If this is my last day to stay at the cabin

790
00:35:46,367 --> 00:35:50,000
then Gino, I'm happy
that I went out with you today.

791
00:35:50,100 --> 00:35:53,367
It's been fun, and your
smile looks adorable.

792
00:35:53,467 --> 00:35:55,733
So whatever the future holds us

793
00:35:55,833 --> 00:35:58,133
we can still keep in touch.

794
00:35:58,241 --> 00:35:59,741
Also, thanks for being
everyone's big brother

795
00:35:59,833 --> 00:36:01,300
and taking care of each of us.

796
00:36:03,233 --> 00:36:04,200
Guan-Yu.

797
00:36:04,733 --> 00:36:06,300
When I first saw you

798
00:36:06,400 --> 00:36:10,267
I thought you looked very cute.

799
00:36:10,367 --> 00:36:16,067
You particularly made me
feel something at first sight.

800
00:36:16,467 --> 00:36:18,767
The more I know about you

801
00:36:20,107 --> 00:36:24,407
the more I realize you put
a lot of pressure on yourself

802
00:36:24,500 --> 00:36:31,600
I think life can be much
easier and happier.

803
00:36:32,500 --> 00:36:35,900
It would be my honor to be the one

804
00:36:36,000 --> 00:36:41,467
whom your share your life with

805
00:36:41,567 --> 00:36:44,500
while you find your next goal

806
00:36:44,600 --> 00:36:46,800
and achieve it

807
00:36:46,900 --> 00:36:49,200
regardless of what my identity is.

808
00:36:49,501 --> 00:36:51,468
And next one...

809
00:36:51,600 --> 00:36:53,133
would be NIO.

810
00:36:53,233 --> 00:36:55,867
NIO is an excellent music producer

811
00:36:55,967 --> 00:36:58,500
I value you as an artist.

812
00:36:58,600 --> 00:37:00,200
Although I've always felt that

813
00:37:00,300 --> 00:37:01,567
you have an unapproachable aura.

814
00:37:01,667 --> 00:37:02,700
But I am really glad

815
00:37:02,800 --> 00:37:05,200
that you shared your
stories about music with me.

816
00:37:05,300 --> 00:37:06,833
It has inspired me to
have this idea that one day

817
00:37:06,933 --> 00:37:09,467
I could still continue my music journey.

818
00:37:11,767 --> 00:37:13,433
Alright, Bobo's turn.

819
00:37:13,967 --> 00:37:15,067
One, two, three.

820
00:37:16,167 --> 00:37:17,200
One more time

821
00:37:17,300 --> 00:37:23,900
I think you are extremely brave and strong.

822
00:37:24,000 --> 00:37:29,567
Your perspective has taught me a lot.

823
00:37:31,100 --> 00:37:32,900
I look forward to this day

824
00:37:33,000 --> 00:37:36,367
when we could be friends forever.

825
00:37:36,467 --> 00:37:40,267
Going diving together and camping

826
00:37:40,367 --> 00:37:43,500
exploring the world.

827
00:37:44,133 --> 00:37:45,733
I'd appreciate it.

828
00:37:46,500 --> 00:37:47,567
Jia-Hang.

829
00:37:47,667 --> 00:37:49,333
You looked too much like my ex-boyfriend

830
00:37:49,433 --> 00:37:51,233
so you made me nervous.

831
00:37:51,333 --> 00:37:55,300
And I'm glad that you were willing to share

832
00:37:55,400 --> 00:37:58,133
what made you uncomfortable
during these three days.

833
00:37:58,233 --> 00:37:59,733
The truth is, asking this question

834
00:37:59,833 --> 00:38:02,633
provides a perfect opportunity for us

835
00:38:02,733 --> 00:38:04,300
- to share different opinions.
- Yeah.

836
00:38:04,400 --> 00:38:06,400
(During dinner time, Jia-Hang talked about his
initial intention of asking about the roles)

837
00:38:06,500 --> 00:38:08,600
If you didn't raise your doubt,
I wouldn't have the chance

838
00:38:08,700 --> 00:38:11,000
to talk about my thoughts on the topic.

839
00:38:11,100 --> 00:38:13,300
We've all cared so much about you.

840
00:38:13,400 --> 00:38:14,967
If there is a possibility in the future

841
00:38:15,067 --> 00:38:16,467
that you want to come hang out with is

842
00:38:16,567 --> 00:38:19,800
you are very welcome
to share anything about yourself with us

843
00:38:19,900 --> 00:38:21,433
I'd like that very much.

844
00:38:21,533 --> 00:38:23,033
Whether you guys are in full bloom

845
00:38:23,133 --> 00:38:24,967
or not in full bloom

846
00:38:25,067 --> 00:38:28,033
I want to collect the flowers
of each and every one of you.

847
00:38:28,133 --> 00:38:29,567
If I'm the one leaving today

848
00:38:29,667 --> 00:38:31,200
I hope you guys

849
00:38:31,315 --> 00:38:33,082
are the most stunning dried flowers.

850
00:38:33,167 --> 00:38:35,333
Like where it all began.

851
00:38:35,433 --> 00:38:38,054
(The recordings have captured the sound and
emotions in this moment, like dried flowers...)

852
00:38:38,079 --> 00:38:39,887
if that wonderful moment of
time could be remembered forever.

853
00:38:39,911 --> 00:38:41,900
Even if I leave later I'd still be
able to take you guys with me.

854
00:38:42,000 --> 00:38:45,333
And I'm very grateful
for the wonderful memories you gave me.

855
00:38:48,783 --> 00:38:53,916
Lastly, I'd like to give everybody a song.

856
00:38:54,000 --> 00:38:58,467
It's very simple and easy

857
00:38:58,567 --> 00:39:00,800
I believe everyone knows this tune.

858
00:39:02,876 --> 00:39:10,067
The more we get
together, together, together.

859
00:39:10,167 --> 00:39:15,467
The more we get together, together

860
00:39:15,567 --> 00:39:19,667
the merrier we'll be.

861
00:39:21,067 --> 00:39:22,700
Thank you, guys

862
00:39:22,800 --> 00:39:24,033
I love you.

863
00:39:24,133 --> 00:39:26,333
Bye.

864
00:39:36,267 --> 00:39:38,033
(Question/What if you're
the one leaving today?)

865
00:39:38,133 --> 00:39:39,767
I mean, give a proper goodbye to everyone

866
00:39:39,867 --> 00:39:43,767
and tell them
what I'd take home after these four days.

867
00:39:43,867 --> 00:39:46,267
And I'd appreciate everyone's accompany.

868
00:39:46,367 --> 00:39:50,367
Yeah, anything could happen.

869
00:39:53,100 --> 00:39:53,833
This is quite pretty.

870
00:39:53,933 --> 00:39:54,667
Give that to me.

871
00:39:54,767 --> 00:39:56,067
This is nice.

872
00:39:56,167 --> 00:39:56,733
Stunning.

873
00:39:56,824 --> 00:39:58,758
This one is artistic.

874
00:39:58,867 --> 00:40:00,200
It looks amazing.

875
00:40:00,276 --> 00:40:01,709
It's giving Picasso.

876
00:40:02,267 --> 00:40:05,967
(They seize every last
bit of moment to hang out)

877
00:40:14,200 --> 00:40:16,000
(Rule/Who do you think wants to leave?)

878
00:40:16,100 --> 00:40:17,701
(Each member has a "leave
ticket" that they can give to

879
00:40:17,725 --> 00:40:19,326
someone who wants to leave.
Who would you give it to?)

880
00:40:23,267 --> 00:40:24,733
Do I have to answer this?

881
00:40:28,533 --> 00:40:30,333
It is a struggle for me.

882
00:40:31,567 --> 00:40:32,633
If this decision is a vote.

883
00:40:32,733 --> 00:40:35,167
Then I don't want this to become a vote

884
00:40:35,267 --> 00:40:36,167
because the first thing crossing my mind

885
00:40:36,267 --> 00:40:38,233
and the last thing to
think about is myself.

886
00:40:38,333 --> 00:40:42,067
Meanwhile, I couldn't bring myself
to leave these people.

887
00:40:42,167 --> 00:40:42,567
Yeah.

888
00:40:43,200 --> 00:40:44,200
I can't cast my vote for anyone

889
00:40:44,300 --> 00:40:45,800
I think I'll choose me

890
00:40:45,900 --> 00:40:47,800
I will vote for me

891
00:40:47,900 --> 00:40:49,433
I will cast the vote for me.

892
00:40:50,167 --> 00:40:54,567
Confirm the final result
