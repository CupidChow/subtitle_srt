1
00:00:03,733 --> 00:00:06,867
(This six-day journey is coming to an end)

2
00:00:13,767 --> 00:00:16,567
(Do you remember the
beginning of the story?)

3
00:00:17,433 --> 00:00:21,233
(On the first day, members
met for the first time)

4
00:00:24,367 --> 00:00:25,267
Hi.

5
00:00:25,367 --> 00:00:26,633
Hello.

6
00:00:27,500 --> 00:00:29,900
Welcome to this love cabin

7
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:33,567
embarking on this six-day dating journey.

8
00:00:33,667 --> 00:00:35,400
Prepare to fall in love.

9
00:00:37,433 --> 00:00:40,200
(Each of them set off their first dates)
The vibe between my me and Bobo

10
00:00:40,300 --> 00:00:41,333
is quite different.

11
00:00:41,433 --> 00:00:43,833
We are worlds apart.

12
00:00:44,933 --> 00:00:46,533
- Thanks.
- How sweet of you.

13
00:00:46,633 --> 00:00:48,133
You're sweet and amazing.

14
00:00:48,233 --> 00:00:49,100
You've guessed it right.

15
00:00:51,967 --> 00:00:54,067
That was too close. I was blushing

16
00:00:54,167 --> 00:00:56,167
I think he is quite sweet.

17
00:00:56,267 --> 00:00:57,900
Yeah, it was like

18
00:00:58,000 --> 00:00:59,333
having butterflies in my stomach.

19
00:00:59,433 --> 00:01:02,033
(Having the first dinner together)
Cheers.

20
00:01:02,133 --> 00:01:03,100
The first day of happiness.

21
00:01:03,200 --> 00:01:04,367
Yeah, the first day.

22
00:01:05,100 --> 00:01:07,467
(At the time, they were feeling
lost in this unfamiliar environment)

23
00:01:07,492 --> 00:01:09,733
- I couldn't jump into the conversations.
- You'd better change.

24
00:01:09,833 --> 00:01:10,767
Change into what?

25
00:01:10,867 --> 00:01:12,933
You'd better talk more.

26
00:01:15,333 --> 00:01:16,433
(Going out with a different
person for the second date)

27
00:01:16,533 --> 00:01:19,100
Please choose your
favorite dating itineraries

28
00:01:19,200 --> 00:01:21,167
and go on a date as a group of two.

29
00:01:22,433 --> 00:01:23,667
Personally, I hope I get to

30
00:01:23,767 --> 00:01:25,433
go out with Gino, right.

31
00:01:26,633 --> 00:01:28,200
(Some loves starts to bloom...)

32
00:01:28,300 --> 00:01:30,467
A hard-working boy.

33
00:01:30,567 --> 00:01:32,633
This is definitely a plus.

34
00:01:33,167 --> 00:01:34,933
He would make jokes.

35
00:01:35,033 --> 00:01:38,033
(Some charm start to show...)
but well, he is also warm.

36
00:01:38,133 --> 00:01:38,767
Yeah.

37
00:01:39,100 --> 00:01:41,158
I've realized how much we
are alike in terms of thoughts.

38
00:01:41,183 --> 00:01:42,408
(Some feelings
begin to surface...)

39
00:01:42,567 --> 00:01:46,000
Sometimes, whenever I catch his eyes

40
00:01:46,123 --> 00:01:48,490
my heart would skip a beat.

41
00:01:48,567 --> 00:01:51,767
(New choices appear)
I'd choose to go on a date with him.

42
00:01:52,567 --> 00:01:54,000
Thanks.

43
00:01:55,900 --> 00:01:57,733
There seem to be others.

44
00:01:57,833 --> 00:01:59,267
So you picked me?

45
00:01:59,367 --> 00:02:00,433
Yeah, well.

46
00:02:00,533 --> 00:02:02,233
You're making me blush.

47
00:02:02,333 --> 00:02:04,600
But it belonged to the eighth person.

48
00:02:04,700 --> 00:02:05,867
The eighth one.

49
00:02:06,800 --> 00:02:09,100
(For the second dinner,
eight members finally unite)

50
00:02:09,200 --> 00:02:11,333
- Hello.
- Hi.

51
00:02:11,433 --> 00:02:12,533
(Two new members had a
chance to go on solo dates)

52
00:02:12,633 --> 00:02:14,967
New two members

53
00:02:15,067 --> 00:02:16,933
please invite someone tonight

54
00:02:17,033 --> 00:02:19,600
to join you for breakfast.

55
00:02:19,700 --> 00:02:21,400
He is like an artist

56
00:02:21,500 --> 00:02:25,033
who is from another planet.

57
00:02:25,133 --> 00:02:26,367
He is kind.

58
00:02:26,467 --> 00:02:28,667
It's nice to chat with him.

59
00:02:28,767 --> 00:02:30,067
After a short conversation

60
00:02:30,167 --> 00:02:31,800
my interest in him has surely

61
00:02:31,900 --> 00:02:32,933
deepened somehow.

62
00:02:33,033 --> 00:02:34,433
That specific feeling hasn't come out yet.

63
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:38,533
Woah, you guys are cute.

64
00:02:42,667 --> 00:02:44,933
(On the third day, members left the cabin)

65
00:02:45,033 --> 00:02:46,333
It's Divecube.

66
00:02:46,433 --> 00:02:49,600
(Spending time in the water together)

67
00:02:50,367 --> 00:02:52,467
MVP

68
00:02:54,700 --> 00:02:57,533
(On this day, love shifts in the air...)
Because my ideal roommate is my opponent.

69
00:03:00,867 --> 00:03:03,100
Guan-Yu, you are sleeping with me again

70
00:03:05,867 --> 00:03:09,167
(and a new room
arrangement appears...)

71
00:03:13,833 --> 00:03:14,833
Who would it be?

72
00:03:14,933 --> 00:03:16,400
I am stressed out.

73
00:03:18,633 --> 00:03:20,700
(That night, a mysterious
guest visited the cabin)

74
00:03:20,800 --> 00:03:22,367
Hi everybody.

75
00:03:22,467 --> 00:03:24,100
(Talking about the past and present)
Hello hello hello!

76
00:03:24,867 --> 00:03:26,667
I've got goosebumps.

77
00:03:26,774 --> 00:03:28,707
If you are falling for someone,
please raise your hand.

78
00:03:28,800 --> 00:03:30,200
(That night, members also reached
out their hands to their crush...)

79
00:03:30,300 --> 00:03:32,300
He is probably at...

80
00:03:32,400 --> 00:03:34,067
It's not nothing

81
00:03:34,167 --> 00:03:35,500
so it's something

82
00:03:36,033 --> 00:03:38,267
(including secret affections...)

83
00:03:38,367 --> 00:03:39,667
It is Guan-Yu

84
00:03:39,767 --> 00:03:42,133
I feel like that is what I'm good at

85
00:03:42,933 --> 00:03:46,033
since no one seems to notice.

86
00:03:46,200 --> 00:03:47,433
(Some manifestations of
love are clear and steadfast)

87
00:03:47,533 --> 00:03:49,633
It made my day to just walk with him

88
00:03:49,733 --> 00:03:50,933
I think there's no doubt

89
00:03:51,033 --> 00:03:52,367
he'd already knows I like him

90
00:03:52,467 --> 00:03:54,167
I've called him twice.

91
00:03:54,267 --> 00:03:55,667
It's about to start...!

92
00:03:57,533 --> 00:03:58,733
Gosh, this is love.

93
00:03:58,833 --> 00:04:00,867
It's so pretty

94
00:04:00,967 --> 00:04:02,833
I wasn't having a great time.

95
00:04:02,933 --> 00:04:03,500
Why is that?

96
00:04:03,600 --> 00:04:05,371
My seat next to me was
empty on the merry-go-round.

97
00:04:05,396 --> 00:04:07,442
(Some loves missed their mark, yet
precious friendships came instead)

98
00:04:07,606 --> 00:04:10,100
- Alright, I'll sleep next to you
- I'm fine, go back.

99
00:04:10,500 --> 00:04:11,633
Let's open it together.

100
00:04:11,733 --> 00:04:12,367
Oh my god

101
00:04:12,467 --> 00:04:14,600
(coming from the future notice) Someone
will be leaving the cabin tomorrow night

102
00:04:14,700 --> 00:04:16,498
(a notice that forced members
to seize every possible moment...)

103
00:04:16,523 --> 00:04:18,200
- Please grab the chance to date at noon.
- Well.

104
00:04:18,300 --> 00:04:19,733
Let's go.

105
00:04:20,867 --> 00:04:21,900
Okay, bye.

106
00:04:30,800 --> 00:04:33,751
(Some weren't brave enough so they
lost the chance to express their feelings)

107
00:04:33,776 --> 00:04:38,233
It reminds me of the time when I was desperate
for love and I kept trying all the ways.

108
00:04:38,333 --> 00:04:40,233
Somehow I'm still the same person

109
00:04:40,333 --> 00:04:41,900
giving myself a lot of pressure.

110
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:43,933
Yeah...

111
00:04:44,367 --> 00:04:47,133
We have that click as we've known forever

112
00:04:47,233 --> 00:04:48,333
but still

113
00:04:48,433 --> 00:04:50,133
we haven't gone out on a date before.

114
00:04:50,667 --> 00:04:52,900
A lot of people have
been looking for happiness.

115
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:55,233
(Some chose their best friend to enjoy simple happiness)
The thing is, they don't realize it is around them.

116
00:04:55,333 --> 00:04:58,400
Bobo gives me tons of happiness.

117
00:05:00,067 --> 00:05:02,367
I guess our lifestyles
are quite the same.

118
00:05:02,467 --> 00:05:04,307
(Some chose to delve deeper
into the future with his crush)

119
00:05:04,332 --> 00:05:06,713
but we could talk those
differences out. Not that

120
00:05:06,737 --> 00:05:09,367
these trivial things would
completely ruin the love.

121
00:05:10,667 --> 00:05:12,667
The four of us went back to the beginning.

122
00:05:12,767 --> 00:05:15,050
(Even if it's the last day, be
sure to seize the happy moments)

123
00:05:15,075 --> 00:05:17,985
Getting to know each other
as whoever we are chatting.

124
00:05:18,009 --> 00:05:20,533
This is probably by
far my favorite day ever.

125
00:05:20,633 --> 00:05:22,900
(There's no regrets or remorse,
even if the feelings aren't mutual)

126
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:26,967
It's my pleasure to meet Bobo without
any touch. I can feel him hugging me.

127
00:05:27,067 --> 00:05:29,167
Feel the warmth of him

128
00:05:29,267 --> 00:05:30,867
I'm glad that

129
00:05:30,967 --> 00:05:33,800
I got to meet Eri on this show.

130
00:05:33,900 --> 00:05:36,333
We talked about a lot of things.

131
00:05:36,433 --> 00:05:38,000
Even though the show is about to end

132
00:05:38,100 --> 00:05:41,000
our stories are about to begin.

133
00:05:42,959 --> 00:05:44,225
Slogan.

134
00:05:46,333 --> 00:05:49,267
Please take your recorder

135
00:05:49,367 --> 00:05:51,933
and leave the message to everyone

136
00:05:52,033 --> 00:05:53,400
if it is your last day

137
00:05:54,767 --> 00:05:57,233
I've lost my will to fight.

138
00:05:57,333 --> 00:05:58,467
Honestly, I don't have any advantages

139
00:05:58,567 --> 00:06:00,433
so I'd probably vote for myself.

140
00:06:02,667 --> 00:06:03,900
Hello

141
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:05,333
I'm Jia-Hang.

142
00:06:09,567 --> 00:06:12,133
Guys, stop.

143
00:06:12,233 --> 00:06:13,867
You are too dramatic.

144
00:06:13,967 --> 00:06:15,733
What are you guys doing?

145
00:06:15,833 --> 00:06:18,533
Hold on, calm down...

146
00:06:18,733 --> 00:06:19,500
It's all good

147
00:06:19,600 --> 00:06:21,367
I think you can stay

148
00:06:21,467 --> 00:06:24,333
I think it is up to you

149
00:06:24,433 --> 00:06:28,981
If you are uncomfortable staying, then I
don't think you need to force yourself

150
00:06:29,006 --> 00:06:31,867
(Jia-Hang's uneasiness fades
away with everyone's understanding)

151
00:06:31,967 --> 00:06:33,300
(deciding to stay for the whole journey...)
At a specific moment

152
00:06:33,400 --> 00:06:35,633
you guys truly caught my insecurity.

153
00:06:35,733 --> 00:06:37,500
It did not keep falling

154
00:06:37,600 --> 00:06:39,333
inside of my body

155
00:06:39,433 --> 00:06:40,967
I hope I get to stay

156
00:06:42,467 --> 00:06:44,267
to be a part of this

157
00:06:44,367 --> 00:06:46,033
amazing journey with everyone.

158
00:06:53,533 --> 00:06:54,767
Camping.

159
00:06:55,200 --> 00:06:57,332
(The fifth day, members
left the cabin to a new place)

160
00:06:57,357 --> 00:06:59,356
Please select the double
tent you wanna live in.

161
00:06:59,633 --> 00:07:03,367
(Time to go on the last solo date) There are
dating itineraries that can be exchanged later.

162
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:07,433
I couldn't find a chance to reach out

163
00:07:07,533 --> 00:07:10,033
and get a chance to save myself.

164
00:07:10,133 --> 00:07:10,767
Yeah

165
00:07:10,867 --> 00:07:12,333
I think this is a perfect opportunity

166
00:07:12,433 --> 00:07:13,800
to get to know Susu again

167
00:07:13,900 --> 00:07:15,600
because we've both grown so much

168
00:07:16,267 --> 00:07:19,933
I've realized NIO and I clicked.

169
00:07:20,033 --> 00:07:21,833
It's fun chatting with him.

170
00:07:22,400 --> 00:07:24,500
The affection I have for NIO is strong.

171
00:07:24,600 --> 00:07:27,767
Keeping the status quo between us.

172
00:07:28,600 --> 00:07:30,300
Barbecue time.

173
00:07:44,575 --> 00:07:46,190
Alright, I like you very much.

174
00:07:46,215 --> 00:07:49,643
(With the help of alcohol, members
open up their hearts on the last day)

175
00:07:49,667 --> 00:07:51,371
(Play hard, love hard, and tell your truest feelings...)

176
00:07:51,396 --> 00:07:55,000
Whether the romance continues or not
whether they meet more amazing people or not

177
00:07:55,100 --> 00:07:57,067
they will be truly happy.

178
00:07:57,867 --> 00:07:58,833
Incredible.

179
00:08:04,900 --> 00:08:10,600
(The brilliant fireworks are
coming to an end, so is the story...)

180
00:08:18,792 --> 00:08:20,259
(Bobo)

181
00:08:20,367 --> 00:08:21,667
(Shi-Fung)

182
00:08:21,767 --> 00:08:22,900
(NIO)

183
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:24,433
(Gino)

184
00:08:24,533 --> 00:08:25,833
(Guan-Yu)

185
00:08:25,933 --> 00:08:27,200
(Eri)

186
00:08:27,300 --> 00:08:28,900
(Susu)

187
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:30,567
(Jia-Hang)

188
00:08:36,700 --> 00:08:38,167
(Boys Like Boys)

189
00:08:38,267 --> 00:08:40,533
(Episode 10: My final choice is...)

190
00:08:43,467 --> 00:08:47,867
(Double Tent / Gino, Guan-Yu)

191
00:08:47,967 --> 00:08:51,500
(After barbecue time,
the two return to their tent)

192
00:08:57,133 --> 00:08:58,600
(being affectionate)
Give me a hug

193
00:08:58,700 --> 00:09:00,433
I stink.

194
00:09:00,767 --> 00:09:01,900
Give me a hug

195
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:03,367
I'm wet.

196
00:09:06,167 --> 00:09:07,700
What?

197
00:09:07,800 --> 00:09:09,200
(Regardless, he wants to hug Guan-Yu)
I'm wet.

198
00:09:09,300 --> 00:09:10,433
Then take it off.

199
00:09:43,367 --> 00:09:45,767
(Double Tent / Bobo, NIO)

200
00:09:45,867 --> 00:09:46,467
NIO

201
00:09:46,567 --> 00:09:48,067
(Meanwhile, in another tent)
I'm here.

202
00:09:48,167 --> 00:09:49,433
Can you take care of yourself?

203
00:09:49,533 --> 00:09:50,400
Absolutely, I'm fine

204
00:09:50,500 --> 00:09:52,367
I'm not as drunk as you.

205
00:09:52,467 --> 00:09:53,333
I'm not drunk.

206
00:09:53,433 --> 00:09:54,833
Since when I'm drunk?

207
00:09:54,933 --> 00:09:57,933
Nothing, I just want to apologize.

208
00:09:58,006 --> 00:09:59,000
What's it for?

209
00:09:59,115 --> 00:10:00,182
(Why is Bobo
apologizing to NIO...?)

210
00:10:00,267 --> 00:10:02,467
Because I'm truly truly
sorry that I scratched you.

211
00:10:02,567 --> 00:10:04,533
(During the contest, Bobo
scratched NIO accidentally)

212
00:10:04,633 --> 00:10:06,033
It's not a big deal.

213
00:10:06,133 --> 00:10:07,900
- It isn't.
- Not a big deal.

214
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:10,367
Alright, I said I'm fine, look.

215
00:10:10,467 --> 00:10:11,833
The wound is healing

216
00:10:11,933 --> 00:10:12,867
- I'm truly sorry.
- All good.

217
00:10:12,967 --> 00:10:14,000
When I'm playing games

218
00:10:14,100 --> 00:10:15,367
I get serious and worked up.

219
00:10:15,467 --> 00:10:16,100
Me too.

220
00:10:16,200 --> 00:10:17,400
Yeah, so hopefully

221
00:10:17,500 --> 00:10:19,267
(popping up)
you guys would scratch me.

222
00:10:19,367 --> 00:10:20,100
No, no.

223
00:10:20,200 --> 00:10:21,100
Welcome...

224
00:10:21,200 --> 00:10:22,300
I wanna sleep with you so bad.

225
00:10:22,400 --> 00:10:23,500
(Eri, whose voice is hoarse,
is also joining the group...)

226
00:10:23,600 --> 00:10:25,100
You're sleeping with me? You
can't sleep with me anymore

227
00:10:25,200 --> 00:10:27,000
I can take the lawn.

228
00:10:28,633 --> 00:10:29,700
I'm really grateful.

229
00:10:29,800 --> 00:10:30,567
Even though I have no idea

230
00:10:30,667 --> 00:10:33,100
whether I could help you or not

231
00:10:33,200 --> 00:10:35,467
I need to process my own feelings.

232
00:10:35,567 --> 00:10:36,867
(Three of them talk about Eri's emotional
speech during dinner) I will be here with you

233
00:10:36,967 --> 00:10:38,800
I totally get this feeling

234
00:10:38,900 --> 00:10:40,767
I'm gonna sleep on his legs

235
00:10:41,500 --> 00:10:43,967
(lying down) OK, I'll just go sleep with others
- Oh, I'm just kidding.

236
00:10:44,067 --> 00:10:45,367
- No...
- I will get back to Jia-Hang later.

237
00:10:45,467 --> 00:10:46,967
Okay, I'll stay with you

238
00:10:47,067 --> 00:10:48,367
(suddenly)(another one pops up)
Another mysterious guest?

239
00:10:48,467 --> 00:10:50,367
- May I.
- Yes.

240
00:10:50,700 --> 00:10:53,200
(The drunk Jia-Hang enters the tent, too)

241
00:10:53,300 --> 00:10:56,100
Thank you for completely understanding me.

242
00:10:56,200 --> 00:10:57,033
Not at all, because.

243
00:10:57,133 --> 00:11:00,633
It might be anything I do to you

244
00:11:00,733 --> 00:11:01,767
(drunk)
May I touch you?

245
00:11:01,867 --> 00:11:02,433
Of course.

246
00:11:02,533 --> 00:11:03,567
Perhaps one of the...

247
00:11:03,667 --> 00:11:06,067
(being affectionate)
one of the words I said to you.

248
00:11:06,167 --> 00:11:09,600
(Eri and NIO continue their dinner table's
conversation...) Like the kiss we had today

249
00:11:09,700 --> 00:11:12,700
I don't think that kiss
involves a romantic element

250
00:11:12,800 --> 00:11:13,633
in other words, I don't...

251
00:11:13,733 --> 00:11:14,567
Me either

252
00:11:14,667 --> 00:11:16,467
I believe this is a...

253
00:11:16,567 --> 00:11:19,333
I think it's a gesture without any pressure

254
00:11:19,433 --> 00:11:20,933
(motionless) I think
sometimes love works this way.

255
00:11:21,033 --> 00:11:23,533
When you fall for
someone, your brain actually.

256
00:11:23,633 --> 00:11:24,700
Our brains are so weird.

257
00:11:24,800 --> 00:11:28,167
Within the next few
weeks, it will suddenly.

258
00:11:28,267 --> 00:11:30,800
(Bobo suddenly got a text) imagine
your whole future with this person.

259
00:11:30,900 --> 00:11:33,033
Whatever the possibility might be...

260
00:11:33,133 --> 00:11:34,367
And you have to

261
00:11:34,467 --> 00:11:36,067
I did imagine a life with you

262
00:11:36,167 --> 00:11:38,300
- but.
- This is actually very normal

263
00:11:38,400 --> 00:11:40,067
I'm taking a shower, excuse me.

264
00:11:40,167 --> 00:11:42,200
Right, but.

265
00:11:44,600 --> 00:11:46,967
He is already gone, with his head down.

266
00:11:47,067 --> 00:11:50,367
Basically he is dead right on my legs.

267
00:11:50,467 --> 00:11:53,100
In the end, I asked for help

268
00:11:53,200 --> 00:11:54,533
and Bobo was out there

269
00:11:54,633 --> 00:11:57,700
I said, "Bobo, I need you to do me a favor"

270
00:11:57,800 --> 00:11:59,300
(Summoned by NIO, Bobo came back
and helped him) Jia-Hang, we are going back

271
00:11:59,400 --> 00:12:00,533
(comfort)
Let's get back, right?

272
00:12:00,633 --> 00:12:01,833
Okay.

273
00:12:02,500 --> 00:12:06,233
(Double Tent / Eri, Jia-Hang)
I'll be stressed if you don't go back.

274
00:12:07,467 --> 00:12:08,967
Get some rest.

275
00:12:11,600 --> 00:12:14,400
Tuck him under the blanket
or he will be frozen to death.

276
00:12:14,500 --> 00:12:15,467
Okay

277
00:12:15,567 --> 00:12:18,367
(working together)

278
00:12:19,267 --> 00:12:20,333
(in the midst of business)

279
00:12:20,433 --> 00:12:23,100
I talked so much with NIO earlier

280
00:12:23,200 --> 00:12:25,333
I know, but I'm taking a shower now.

281
00:12:25,433 --> 00:12:28,867
Can you let me have a moment for myself?

282
00:12:28,967 --> 00:12:30,600
You haven't taken a shower?

283
00:12:31,267 --> 00:12:33,700
(Question/Why did you suddenly
leave the tent?) Originally, NIO and Eri

284
00:12:33,800 --> 00:12:35,133
was chatting in the room.

285
00:12:35,248 --> 00:12:37,615
Somehow I felt
like I was in the way.

286
00:12:37,700 --> 00:12:38,700
Like, in their way

287
00:12:38,800 --> 00:12:40,600
so I went out and looked for Susu.

288
00:12:40,700 --> 00:12:41,500
This imagination...

289
00:12:41,600 --> 00:12:42,667
You're going for a shower?

290
00:12:42,767 --> 00:12:44,733
Let me know if no one is there.

291
00:12:44,833 --> 00:12:46,367
(Bobo is gonna join Susu for a shower)
I think I have a company.

292
00:12:46,467 --> 00:12:51,300
Your imagination will be
falling apart as days pass.

293
00:12:51,400 --> 00:12:52,910
(Question/Bobo texted and asked for a shower together?)

294
00:12:52,935 --> 00:12:55,200
He texted me, asking if I wanted to
shower together. And I replied, "Oh, sure".

295
00:12:55,300 --> 00:12:56,267
Well, after I said yes to him

296
00:12:56,367 --> 00:12:58,500
next thing I know, I said.

297
00:12:58,600 --> 00:13:00,667
"What? Ahaha, you pervert."

298
00:13:00,767 --> 00:13:02,267
Well, later on

299
00:13:02,367 --> 00:13:04,933
I went to take a shower myself.

300
00:13:05,033 --> 00:13:07,367
He just showed up the next minute

301
00:13:07,467 --> 00:13:09,100
asking me if I was in that bathroom.

302
00:13:09,200 --> 00:13:09,900
And I was like

303
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:11,400
I thought you didn't
want to shower together.

304
00:13:11,500 --> 00:13:14,233
Well then, I thought it was fine
and opened the door.

305
00:13:14,333 --> 00:13:15,667
He came in after the door was opened

306
00:13:15,767 --> 00:13:18,300
I found a tub and I wanted to take a bath.

307
00:13:18,400 --> 00:13:19,367
(Despite the seemingly small
tub, would it fit all of them?)

308
00:13:19,467 --> 00:13:20,767
When the water was heating up, Eri came out.

309
00:13:20,867 --> 00:13:23,833
And I said there was a tub
and asked if he wanted to join.

310
00:13:23,933 --> 00:13:25,933
It never crossed my
mind that he'd say yes.

311
00:13:26,033 --> 00:13:27,667
Actually, this was the first time...

312
00:13:27,767 --> 00:13:29,767
I took a bath with someone
that was not my ex.

313
00:13:30,833 --> 00:13:32,567
Well then, I was wondering

314
00:13:32,667 --> 00:13:33,300
what is going on right now.

315
00:13:33,400 --> 00:13:35,233
Isn't this perfect already?

316
00:13:35,333 --> 00:13:36,333
There are two of us there.

317
00:13:36,433 --> 00:13:38,333
The vibe has already ceased to exist.

318
00:13:38,433 --> 00:13:39,267
Okay, after the vibe was off.

319
00:13:39,367 --> 00:13:40,833
Fine, it was all friendship.

320
00:13:40,933 --> 00:13:42,600
While people were having fun chatting

321
00:13:42,700 --> 00:13:43,333
in the middle of the conversation.

322
00:13:43,433 --> 00:13:44,867
Suddenly, bang bang...

323
00:13:44,967 --> 00:13:46,133
The banging sound was loud.

324
00:13:46,233 --> 00:13:48,700
(While Susu, Bobo, and Eri was taking a
bath, another one joined in) It sounded hasty

325
00:13:48,800 --> 00:13:50,067
I wondered who it was

326
00:13:50,167 --> 00:13:51,333
I opened the door.

327
00:13:51,433 --> 00:13:52,300
Gino was right there.

328
00:13:52,400 --> 00:13:53,967
"Why are you here" and I closed the door.

329
00:13:54,067 --> 00:13:56,133
He pushed the door open with force

330
00:13:56,233 --> 00:13:58,000
and cried next to us.

331
00:13:58,133 --> 00:14:00,300
And then comes someone stirring up trouble

332
00:14:00,400 --> 00:14:01,633
I was like, okay.

333
00:14:01,717 --> 00:14:04,184
Right there, the four
of us ended up together.

334
00:14:04,533 --> 00:14:08,533
(What exactly happened to Gino...?)

335
00:14:09,633 --> 00:14:12,600
After all, we got a chance
to spend some alone time

336
00:14:12,700 --> 00:14:18,067
and I wanted to discuss our next step

337
00:14:18,167 --> 00:14:19,633
this thing between us.

338
00:14:19,733 --> 00:14:21,667
Apparently, these six days are incredible.

339
00:14:21,767 --> 00:14:22,567
After these six days

340
00:14:22,667 --> 00:14:26,167
we will get back to our normal lives.

341
00:14:26,267 --> 00:14:28,467
Still, I'd like to talk

342
00:14:28,567 --> 00:14:33,333
about our perspectives on the future.

343
00:14:33,433 --> 00:14:34,233
(Double Tent / Gino, Guan-Yu)

344
00:14:34,333 --> 00:14:38,300
(They have a conversation before the
shower) Sometimes, living to this age

345
00:14:38,400 --> 00:14:41,533
I intend to not make life this hard.

346
00:14:42,467 --> 00:14:46,333
I'm sorry that I bring you these troubles

347
00:14:46,433 --> 00:14:49,300
I said this out of the reason

348
00:14:49,400 --> 00:14:51,800
that I like you.

349
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:55,133
Forget it, then.

350
00:14:55,233 --> 00:14:57,567
In my opinion, things
aren't that complicated.

351
00:14:57,667 --> 00:15:00,467
Of course things are complicated
This society is complicated.

352
00:15:00,567 --> 00:15:03,000
Well, I just want to be happy
during these six days.

353
00:15:03,100 --> 00:15:05,067
Okay, that's it, just be happy.

354
00:15:05,900 --> 00:15:06,900
Right.

355
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:08,533
(Guan-Yu doesn't seem to agree with Gino...)

356
00:15:08,633 --> 00:15:12,167
(helpless) I don't want
you to have this impression.

357
00:15:16,367 --> 00:15:18,200
That you are wronged.

358
00:15:20,400 --> 00:15:23,133
(Question/What happened with Gino last night?)
We had a small fight before the shower.

359
00:15:23,233 --> 00:15:24,333
Probably because he was drunk.

360
00:15:24,433 --> 00:15:26,267
He started to mumble a few things.

361
00:15:26,367 --> 00:15:28,500
I also hoped that he
wouldn't treat me like a kid.

362
00:15:28,600 --> 00:15:30,133
We are two individuals.

363
00:15:30,233 --> 00:15:34,333
It's not about our identities.

364
00:15:34,600 --> 00:15:36,133
Personally.

365
00:15:36,233 --> 00:15:37,933
Am I sounding too preachy?

366
00:15:38,033 --> 00:15:40,933
Your whole point has been centered

367
00:15:41,033 --> 00:15:43,267
on this idea that I'm a kid
and I can't deal with it.

368
00:15:43,367 --> 00:15:44,900
There's nothing I can say at this point.

369
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:46,333
Because you...

370
00:15:46,433 --> 00:15:48,867
It's not like I haven't
thought about what you said.

371
00:15:49,467 --> 00:15:52,500
Anyway, I never thought you would

372
00:15:52,600 --> 00:15:54,833
(hesitating)
You would...

373
00:15:54,933 --> 00:15:55,867
I mean, I am aware

374
00:15:55,967 --> 00:15:58,267
that you wouldn't possibly
be interested in me

375
00:15:58,367 --> 00:16:01,767
I am sincere toward you
it's just...

376
00:16:01,867 --> 00:16:05,267
Some issues would start to come up

377
00:16:05,367 --> 00:16:07,167
after this goes on for a while.

378
00:16:07,244 --> 00:16:08,510
(They hold different attitude
toward future possibilities...)

379
00:16:08,633 --> 00:16:10,933
Yes, I'm aware. Then again,
which relationship isn't like this?

380
00:16:11,033 --> 00:16:13,133
Love is a long-term thing.

381
00:16:13,233 --> 00:16:14,500
It requires so many adjustments

382
00:16:14,600 --> 00:16:19,100
I believe it takes time.

383
00:16:19,200 --> 00:16:20,267
How is it possible to decide

384
00:16:20,367 --> 00:16:23,300
our future directions within these six days?

385
00:16:23,400 --> 00:16:26,600
Plus, it's not that a simple no or I can't,

386
00:16:26,700 --> 00:16:29,000
one rejection would deny all possibilities.

387
00:16:29,100 --> 00:16:31,233
Personally, it's too...

388
00:16:31,333 --> 00:16:32,333
On the opposite

389
00:16:32,433 --> 00:16:35,000
this cuts off all the possibilities.

390
00:16:39,967 --> 00:16:41,467
You know in your heart
that you could hurt me

391
00:16:41,567 --> 00:16:42,700
then why did you pick me?

392
00:16:47,833 --> 00:16:50,767
(Guan-Yu is hurt by what Gino said...) You know
all too well you could hurt me, why me then?

393
00:16:50,867 --> 00:16:54,067
I asked him questions
on a more realistic level.

394
00:16:54,167 --> 00:16:58,033
Long-distance, age, and perspectives.

395
00:16:58,133 --> 00:17:00,100
Yeah.

396
00:17:00,200 --> 00:17:03,067
It becomes clear to me

397
00:17:03,167 --> 00:17:04,533
as if I could already see

398
00:17:04,633 --> 00:17:07,100
the image of us together in the future.

399
00:17:07,200 --> 00:17:11,433
It might lead to frequent arguments.

400
00:17:12,867 --> 00:17:13,833
I know you're scared to hurt me

401
00:17:13,933 --> 00:17:16,367
so you do this as a preventive approach.

402
00:17:16,467 --> 00:17:18,333
Somehow, it looks like a backfire to me.

403
00:17:18,433 --> 00:17:20,500
To be frank

404
00:17:20,600 --> 00:17:23,167
it's like we stand no chance to improve.

405
00:17:23,275 --> 00:17:26,175
Like we don't even give it a try.

406
00:17:26,867 --> 00:17:28,700
(Gino's pessimism about the future
leaves Guan-Yu feeling powerless)

407
00:17:28,800 --> 00:17:32,567
Or maybe you knew the outcome all along

408
00:17:32,667 --> 00:17:35,267
but you did it anyway.

409
00:17:35,367 --> 00:17:37,000
Maybe that's what hurts the most.

410
00:17:42,867 --> 00:17:49,167
(Guan-Yu left the tent and Gino alone)

411
00:18:09,467 --> 00:18:13,233
(DAY 6)

412
00:18:13,588 --> 00:18:17,221
(Double Tent / Susu, Shi-Fung)

413
00:18:24,433 --> 00:18:26,833
Shi-Fung, wake up.

414
00:18:28,100 --> 00:18:32,900
Your phone keeps ringing.

415
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:34,067
Sorry.

416
00:18:34,167 --> 00:18:35,667
It's fine. I turned it off

417
00:18:35,767 --> 00:18:37,167
(slipping)

418
00:18:38,500 --> 00:18:39,233
Careful.

419
00:18:39,333 --> 00:18:44,333
(On this final morning, Shi-Fung seems
reluctant to wake up...)(going back to sleep)

420
00:18:44,433 --> 00:18:46,100
Time to wake up...

421
00:18:46,200 --> 00:18:47,033
Okay.

422
00:18:47,433 --> 00:18:50,267
(Double Tent / Gino, Guan-Yu)

423
00:18:50,767 --> 00:18:52,933
(closing in suddenly)

424
00:18:58,133 --> 00:19:03,400
(Why would Gino start
to make these gestures?)

425
00:19:05,367 --> 00:19:09,267
(It seems like it is perfect for an
ice-breaking and brain-awakening)

426
00:19:10,867 --> 00:19:13,067
Give me the blanket. I will fold it.

427
00:19:15,800 --> 00:19:20,467
(Would both of them change their final
decision despite the fight last night...)

428
00:19:22,667 --> 00:19:26,267
(Double Tent / Eri, Jia-Hang)

429
00:19:26,459 --> 00:19:27,659
(Why did Eri return to the text from outside...?)
Are you getting some sleep?

430
00:19:27,767 --> 00:19:30,167
No, no sleeping. I'm here to do my makeup.

431
00:19:31,967 --> 00:19:33,267
Are you feeling unwell?

432
00:19:33,367 --> 00:19:35,733
No, I have a little hangover.

433
00:19:36,867 --> 00:19:38,433
You slept with NIO yesterday.

434
00:19:38,533 --> 00:19:40,300
Yeah.

435
00:19:40,400 --> 00:19:41,500
You guys hugged?

436
00:19:41,600 --> 00:19:44,500
No, but I intended to sleep with Bobo.

437
00:19:46,100 --> 00:19:46,933
(Doulbe Tent / Bobo, NIO)

438
00:19:47,033 --> 00:19:48,733
I actually want to sleep with you guys

439
00:19:48,833 --> 00:19:50,100
(before going to bed)
You wanna sleep with us?

440
00:19:50,200 --> 00:19:51,600
Well, you can take the bed
I'll take the floor

441
00:19:51,700 --> 00:19:54,333
I will sleep with you, on that side.

442
00:19:54,433 --> 00:19:57,567
This feels better. It is more comfy.

443
00:19:57,667 --> 00:20:00,733
(Eri ended up sleeping in the same bed with
NIO) Or do you want me to be in the middle?

444
00:20:00,833 --> 00:20:03,067
Not that it matters now.

445
00:20:03,167 --> 00:20:04,700
We've laid it out in the open

446
00:20:04,800 --> 00:20:07,300
to a point our legs are wide open.

447
00:20:09,100 --> 00:20:10,433
They are literally wide open

448
00:20:10,533 --> 00:20:11,933
I don't care, excuse me.

449
00:20:12,933 --> 00:20:15,867
(Double Tent / Susu, Shi-Fung)
You guys ended up taking a bath together.

450
00:20:15,967 --> 00:20:16,567
We did.

451
00:20:16,667 --> 00:20:17,400
So happy.

452
00:20:17,500 --> 00:20:18,600
It was truly so weird.

453
00:20:18,700 --> 00:20:19,500
Very happy

454
00:20:19,600 --> 00:20:22,333
I thought it was so weird.

455
00:20:22,433 --> 00:20:23,833
Why?

456
00:20:23,933 --> 00:20:25,167
Why did I get myself into this?

457
00:20:25,400 --> 00:20:26,667
The point is

458
00:20:26,767 --> 00:20:29,933
if there are any opportunities today.

459
00:20:30,033 --> 00:20:32,433
(Shi-Fung encourages Susu to interact
with Bobo...) you could talk to Bobo more.

460
00:20:32,533 --> 00:20:35,067
In my opinion.

461
00:20:35,167 --> 00:20:38,633
Do you know we actually don't
live far away from each other?

462
00:20:38,733 --> 00:20:39,800
To the point that

463
00:20:39,900 --> 00:20:41,333
the drive only takes 10 minutes

464
00:20:41,433 --> 00:20:42,867
- to get to each other's place.
- Indeed, what's the rush?

465
00:20:42,967 --> 00:20:46,200
- You've got a point.
- Yeah.

466
00:20:46,315 --> 00:20:48,048
Besides, listen to what he said yesterday

467
00:20:48,133 --> 00:20:50,900
(little game at the campfire yesterday)
Let's play true or dare.

468
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:55,100
I...

469
00:20:55,200 --> 00:20:57,133
I'll pick Bobo.

470
00:20:57,233 --> 00:20:59,467
(Susu appointed Bobo to do the truth)

471
00:20:59,567 --> 00:21:00,600
I know.

472
00:21:00,700 --> 00:21:02,433
What is your first impression of me?

473
00:21:03,433 --> 00:21:05,300
My first impression of you.

474
00:21:05,400 --> 00:21:07,400
My first impression of Susu

475
00:21:07,500 --> 00:21:11,467
was when we were at Fitness Factory.

476
00:21:11,567 --> 00:21:12,500
We had the exact

477
00:21:12,600 --> 00:21:14,533
same coach before.

478
00:21:15,667 --> 00:21:18,100
(Through the game, Bobo expressed
his true feelings toward Susu)

479
00:21:18,191 --> 00:21:21,700
I'm glad I finally found someone I knew
and here's my chance finally to be able

480
00:21:21,800 --> 00:21:24,133
to interact with him more.

481
00:21:24,233 --> 00:21:27,367
Well, our places are close to each other

482
00:21:27,467 --> 00:21:29,267
which means

483
00:21:29,367 --> 00:21:31,767
I'm not sure what will happen from here

484
00:21:31,867 --> 00:21:33,467
but hopefully

485
00:21:33,567 --> 00:21:35,467
you saw what I did this morning.

486
00:21:35,567 --> 00:21:36,533
That's all

487
00:21:36,633 --> 00:21:38,800
(blushing all of a sudden)
- Well, okay - That's it.

488
00:21:41,933 --> 00:21:44,067
So what? I have to...

489
00:21:44,167 --> 00:21:45,539
I have to see what
goes on today.

490
00:21:45,564 --> 00:21:47,110
(As the end is near, would Susu
express his affection toward Bobo?...)

491
00:21:47,200 --> 00:21:49,400
You mean to see what you'll do?

492
00:21:49,507 --> 00:21:52,040
To see what I'll do.

493
00:21:59,967 --> 00:22:01,600
Morning.

494
00:22:01,700 --> 00:22:03,967
Morning.

495
00:22:06,167 --> 00:22:09,400
Morning.

496
00:22:12,067 --> 00:22:14,467
- We are making our own breakfast?
- Yeah.

497
00:22:15,333 --> 00:22:17,700
You just learned about it?

498
00:22:17,800 --> 00:22:19,500
(being sweet) Why don't you
grab a small croissant first?

499
00:22:20,133 --> 00:22:21,000
I'll take it.

500
00:22:22,533 --> 00:22:23,233
Can't wait any longer

501
00:22:23,333 --> 00:22:25,133
I fear your stomach would growl so loud.

502
00:22:27,100 --> 00:22:28,700
I was starving yesterday.

503
00:22:29,333 --> 00:22:31,067
-So you had two bowls. I know.

504
00:22:31,833 --> 00:22:33,400
(Let's prepare the breakfast together!)
There are three flavors

505
00:22:33,500 --> 00:22:35,133
I like the corn one.

506
00:22:35,233 --> 00:22:36,867
Sure, the corn one.

507
00:22:36,967 --> 00:22:38,267
The roast chicken smells amazing.

508
00:22:42,233 --> 00:22:43,933
Men making breakfast is the best.

509
00:22:44,033 --> 00:22:45,200
You are the best.

510
00:22:53,333 --> 00:22:54,900
Awesome.

511
00:22:55,133 --> 00:22:57,567
This one is done
They look delicious.

512
00:22:57,667 --> 00:22:59,433
You are fast

513
00:23:00,033 --> 00:23:01,333
(professional)

514
00:23:03,567 --> 00:23:05,433
Woah, you made it look so pretty.

515
00:23:05,533 --> 00:23:06,333
Yeah

516
00:23:06,433 --> 00:23:08,433
- I feel like.
- It looks high-quality

517
00:23:08,533 --> 00:23:10,733
(professional cook)
And we don't have to do anything.

518
00:23:10,833 --> 00:23:12,167
- Are there scissors over there?
- Hang on

519
00:23:12,267 --> 00:23:13,933
I think it's burning.

520
00:23:14,033 --> 00:23:14,900
Butter knife.

521
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:16,967
It is burned

522
00:23:17,067 --> 00:23:17,900
I told you so

523
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:19,967
(too passionate)

524
00:23:21,367 --> 00:23:22,867
Grilled Chinese omlet.

525
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:33,433
(People get more comfortable with each other
after six days) Do I see fried eggs over there?

526
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:35,867
Hard to say.

527
00:23:35,967 --> 00:23:37,800
Maybe the grill comes first
and frying comes next.

528
00:23:48,333 --> 00:23:49,108
So chill.

529
00:23:49,133 --> 00:23:50,267
Does anyone have a hangover?

530
00:23:50,367 --> 00:23:51,967
No, hanging in there.

531
00:23:52,067 --> 00:23:52,767
Just me.

532
00:23:52,867 --> 00:23:53,533
You have one.

533
00:23:53,633 --> 00:23:54,800
My head hurts.

534
00:23:54,900 --> 00:23:56,610
I don't have a hangover, but
I've got wounds on my hands.

535
00:23:56,635 --> 00:23:58,508
(Last night, what happened
to the drunk Eri...?)

536
00:23:58,541 --> 00:23:59,541
The wounds are so random.

537
00:24:00,900 --> 00:24:02,500
I guess that's because
you did that yesterday

538
00:24:02,600 --> 00:24:04,100
(this is Eri yesterday)(passionate)(energetic)
- Well - What exactly did...

539
00:24:04,200 --> 00:24:05,833
Don't give me any details about yesterday.

540
00:24:05,933 --> 00:24:07,167
Just go back and see the clips

541
00:24:07,267 --> 00:24:08,833
I have no interest in knowing that.

542
00:24:09,567 --> 00:24:12,767
You would be an excellent dancer-singer.

543
00:24:12,867 --> 00:24:14,233
A dancer-singer.

544
00:24:14,333 --> 00:24:15,167
Yeah, you are.

545
00:24:15,267 --> 00:24:18,130
Besides, they played
that amazing song of yours.

546
00:24:18,556 --> 00:24:19,100
Yeah.

547
00:24:19,200 --> 00:24:20,767
Me and Shi-Fung were talking about it.

548
00:24:20,867 --> 00:24:22,433
Do you have the name of the song?

549
00:24:22,533 --> 00:24:23,633
"Don't Refill."

550
00:24:23,733 --> 00:24:25,233
You ended up having many more drinks.

551
00:24:26,033 --> 00:24:28,200
I think I've had seven or eight drinks.

552
00:24:29,433 --> 00:24:31,033
However, sometimes
when I hear people playing my songs

553
00:24:31,133 --> 00:24:33,400
in front of other people

554
00:24:33,492 --> 00:24:34,525
- honestly.
- I get it.

555
00:24:34,633 --> 00:24:36,333
You'd feel shy

556
00:24:36,433 --> 00:24:37,467
I don't know how to react.

557
00:24:37,567 --> 00:24:38,500
Yeah, I don't know how to...

558
00:24:38,600 --> 00:24:40,233
You had a huge reaction.

559
00:24:40,800 --> 00:24:47,333
(They are playing
Eri's song at the end)

560
00:24:47,433 --> 00:24:51,367
(With the influence of alcohol and music, Eri hugged Susu and cried)

561
00:24:51,733 --> 00:24:53,167
I totally forgot.

562
00:24:53,267 --> 00:24:54,300
Please watch VCR

563
00:24:54,400 --> 00:24:55,500
I bet I almost jumped into the fire

564
00:24:55,600 --> 00:24:56,433
you did

565
00:24:56,533 --> 00:24:57,467
(wobbly)
Seriously?

566
00:24:57,567 --> 00:24:58,533
Yeah.

567
00:24:58,633 --> 00:25:01,367
Sometimes you said you'd jump right in.

568
00:25:04,220 --> 00:25:06,667
How come there's a fork but no knife?

569
00:25:06,767 --> 00:25:08,300
- They have butter knife.
- The only thing we got.

570
00:25:08,400 --> 00:25:09,700
This kind of knife.

571
00:25:09,800 --> 00:25:12,100
Don't tell me you're using a knife and fork.

572
00:25:12,200 --> 00:25:13,300
You want a fork?

573
00:25:13,400 --> 00:25:14,467
Someone will feed you

574
00:25:14,567 --> 00:25:15,800
(copying)
Knife.

575
00:25:25,700 --> 00:25:27,667
(Double Tent / Gino, Guan-Yu)

576
00:25:27,767 --> 00:25:31,267
Hi, I'm back.

577
00:25:33,067 --> 00:25:34,533
(After breakfast, they return to their separate tents)
I'm looking at Jia-Hang's picture.

578
00:25:34,633 --> 00:25:35,400
Let me see.

579
00:25:35,500 --> 00:25:37,167
Adorable.

580
00:25:37,267 --> 00:25:38,800
Where? His Instagram?

581
00:25:40,567 --> 00:25:41,600
He is gorgeous.

582
00:25:43,767 --> 00:25:46,767
(Guan-Yu keeps bringing up his ex...)
He looks exactly like my boyfriend.

583
00:25:46,867 --> 00:25:47,733
His eyes look so lonely.

584
00:25:47,833 --> 00:25:50,667
So... lonely.

585
00:25:51,067 --> 00:25:52,767
(Double Tent / Eri, Jia-Hang)

586
00:25:53,300 --> 00:25:56,000
(Jia-Hang is packing up his suitcase alone)

587
00:25:57,300 --> 00:25:58,200
What?

588
00:25:58,284 --> 00:25:59,617
Nothing, they said it's time to pack.

589
00:25:59,733 --> 00:26:00,833
- Yeah.
- We're checking out.

590
00:26:01,733 --> 00:26:03,867
Later on

591
00:26:03,967 --> 00:26:05,667
the suits we are wearing.

592
00:26:05,767 --> 00:26:06,667
What about that?

593
00:26:06,767 --> 00:26:10,200
If you need me to fix your hair

594
00:26:10,300 --> 00:26:12,000
I mean, if you guys need a hand
just let me know.

595
00:26:12,100 --> 00:26:14,000
(Eri proposes that he could help with
the hair...) Are you kidding? Yes, please.

596
00:26:14,100 --> 00:26:16,333
- Yeah.
- Please!

597
00:26:16,433 --> 00:26:17,267
But do get in line.

598
00:26:17,367 --> 00:26:19,500
A lot of people have booked me already.

599
00:26:19,600 --> 00:26:20,667
No problem.

600
00:26:20,767 --> 00:26:23,800
(Double Tent / Bobo, NIO)

601
00:26:23,900 --> 00:26:25,500
(Shi-Fung and Susu are chatting in other people's tent)
You guys are scary.

602
00:26:29,200 --> 00:26:30,500
Who is it?

603
00:26:30,600 --> 00:26:31,533
It's me.

604
00:26:31,633 --> 00:26:33,167
The owner of this tent.

605
00:26:33,267 --> 00:26:34,567
The owner

606
00:26:34,667 --> 00:26:36,533
I haven't finished my journey.

607
00:26:36,633 --> 00:26:38,267
- You haven't?
- Yeah.

608
00:26:38,367 --> 00:26:40,000
Please keep the massage going.

609
00:26:40,867 --> 00:26:42,700
Hilarious.

610
00:26:42,800 --> 00:26:44,333
So you were massaging earlier.

611
00:26:44,433 --> 00:26:45,533
Turn around, yeah.

612
00:26:45,833 --> 00:26:49,033
(Would things heat up after Susu gave Bobo the massage...?)

613
00:26:53,767 --> 00:26:55,133
Bullying

614
00:26:56,300 --> 00:26:58,300
(getting in again)

615
00:26:58,400 --> 00:26:59,900
Welcome back.

616
00:27:01,400 --> 00:27:03,667
I should change it to...

617
00:27:03,767 --> 00:27:06,500
Water Bobo.

618
00:27:07,967 --> 00:27:10,367
This is yours.

619
00:27:12,533 --> 00:27:14,300
This journalist is now at Gay's Apartment.

620
00:27:14,400 --> 00:27:17,367
Here, we have four gays.

621
00:27:17,467 --> 00:27:19,967
(Going Live) They are
following each other's Instagram.

622
00:27:22,967 --> 00:27:24,533
Come on.

623
00:27:27,433 --> 00:27:29,767
Let's get back to our host on the set.

624
00:27:32,033 --> 00:27:33,833
(Double Tent / Gino, Guan-Yu)
My head hurts.

625
00:27:34,800 --> 00:27:36,000
See.

626
00:27:36,100 --> 00:27:38,100
- Keep drinking.
- I need a massage

627
00:27:38,200 --> 00:27:40,833
(affectionate)(stern)
I told you to stop drinking.

628
00:27:42,533 --> 00:27:44,233
Should I sit or lie down?

629
00:27:44,333 --> 00:27:45,367
Lie down.

630
00:27:49,000 --> 00:27:49,733
Bobo.

631
00:27:49,821 --> 00:27:51,167
Did you and Bobo know before this?

632
00:27:51,267 --> 00:27:52,100
(They talked about other
members on their mind) I did not

633
00:27:52,200 --> 00:27:53,933
(but not the issue they fought about)
So he has completely fallen for you.

634
00:27:54,033 --> 00:27:56,500
- Nah.
- Fell for you within these couple of days.

635
00:27:57,375 --> 00:27:59,375
But I feel like...

636
00:27:59,467 --> 00:28:01,900
Not necessarily.

637
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:03,000
Look at you.

638
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:05,400
You're too handsome.

639
00:28:05,500 --> 00:28:07,867
- Too handsome? Who?
- You.

640
00:28:07,967 --> 00:28:10,133
Are people this superficial?

641
00:28:11,633 --> 00:28:13,133
Not at all, I think Jia-Hang is cute too

642
00:28:13,233 --> 00:28:15,000
but I'm not falling for him.

643
00:28:15,100 --> 00:28:17,433
So I don't think that's
where the issue lies.

644
00:28:18,633 --> 00:28:19,333
(NIO rushed them to check out)

645
00:28:19,433 --> 00:28:21,333
Hello.

646
00:28:21,433 --> 00:28:22,967
Hi, we are checking out.

647
00:28:23,067 --> 00:28:24,000
Alright, let's go.

648
00:28:24,100 --> 00:28:25,333
Okay.

649
00:28:25,433 --> 00:28:26,767
Thanks.

650
00:28:26,833 --> 00:28:31,500
(Would this interaction
influence the final decision...)

651
00:28:42,567 --> 00:28:47,133
(With the change of attire,
let's put an end to this journey)

652
00:29:02,867 --> 00:29:06,900
(Do members have the
final answer in their minds...)

653
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:13,600
(Question/Did you make the final call?)
Yeah, I've made up my mind.

654
00:29:15,567 --> 00:29:17,700
There I am, hesitating again.

655
00:29:22,615 --> 00:29:23,448
Well, now I'm hesitating

656
00:29:23,533 --> 00:29:25,333
whether I should choose that person

657
00:29:25,433 --> 00:29:28,200
or whether I should choose my crush.

658
00:29:32,800 --> 00:29:34,133
I chose Gino for the first round.

659
00:29:34,233 --> 00:29:37,433
(Question/Did you make the final call?)
and NIO for the second round.

660
00:29:37,533 --> 00:29:40,033
The reason why I chose them

661
00:29:40,133 --> 00:29:42,867
all comes down their ideal appearance.

662
00:29:42,967 --> 00:29:44,467
So I picked them.

663
00:29:55,667 --> 00:29:56,567
(Question/Did you have the final call?)

664
00:29:56,667 --> 00:29:59,633
I've told Bobo specifically

665
00:29:59,733 --> 00:30:02,967
that he isn't allowed to
pick me no matter what.

666
00:30:04,200 --> 00:30:06,267
In my opinion, I'm not even his type.

667
00:30:06,367 --> 00:30:09,133
Anyway, we've gotten
so close to each other.

668
00:30:09,233 --> 00:30:12,000
There's no way we could be a couple.

669
00:30:13,033 --> 00:30:16,067
I think he should be responsible
for his feelings

670
00:30:16,167 --> 00:30:17,867
follow his own heart

671
00:30:17,967 --> 00:30:19,667
instead of compromising.

672
00:30:19,767 --> 00:30:21,167
Unless he likes me.

673
00:30:21,267 --> 00:30:23,100
Then fine, you can choose me.

674
00:30:27,733 --> 00:30:29,633
I've thought about picking Susu.

675
00:30:29,733 --> 00:30:33,533
(Question/Did you make the final call?)
After my complete change of personality

676
00:30:33,633 --> 00:30:35,267
when Water-Bobo

677
00:30:35,367 --> 00:30:38,300
was summoned,
he would always get me tissues.

678
00:30:38,400 --> 00:30:41,233
And asked me if I was okay.

679
00:30:41,309 --> 00:30:43,209
The affection level has indeed gone up.

680
00:30:44,667 --> 00:30:46,867
- Thanks, Eri.
- My pleasure.

681
00:30:50,300 --> 00:30:51,533
As for Guan-Yu

682
00:30:51,633 --> 00:30:53,067
his appearance and personality.

683
00:30:53,167 --> 00:30:54,833
(Susu clearly expressed his thoughts
about Guan-Yu in previous interviews)

684
00:30:54,933 --> 00:30:57,667
are extremely attractive to me. But well...

685
00:30:57,767 --> 00:31:00,000
I genuinely believe my personality

686
00:31:00,100 --> 00:31:01,867
or should I say some of my experiences

687
00:31:01,967 --> 00:31:03,767
would be completely
unacceptable for him.

688
00:31:03,867 --> 00:31:05,533
So there is kind of

689
00:31:05,633 --> 00:31:08,100
fear of getting intimidated.

690
00:31:08,867 --> 00:31:10,667
I'd appreciate it.

691
00:31:10,767 --> 00:31:12,133
You do look like

692
00:31:12,233 --> 00:31:14,267
someone who needs this.

693
00:31:15,000 --> 00:31:16,233
(Question/Did you make the final call?)
I won't choose Guan-Yu

694
00:31:16,333 --> 00:31:20,033
because we've discussed this issue.

695
00:31:20,133 --> 00:31:21,967
On so many levels, we aren't a great fit.

696
00:31:22,067 --> 00:31:24,933
It's an attraction on the surface level.

697
00:31:25,033 --> 00:31:26,333
Is there any way

698
00:31:26,433 --> 00:31:29,900
I am suitable for this person?

699
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:31,900
Hypothetically speaking, choosing him

700
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:33,267
would be quite irresponsible

701
00:31:33,367 --> 00:31:34,533
since my attraction and feelings toward him

702
00:31:34,633 --> 00:31:39,133
are at a very basic level.

703
00:31:42,700 --> 00:31:43,767
Is it too tight?

704
00:31:43,867 --> 00:31:44,967
Not really.

705
00:31:46,384 --> 00:31:47,917
As far as I know, Guan-Yu

706
00:31:48,033 --> 00:31:51,267
is someone who genuinely
needs someone's love.

707
00:31:51,367 --> 00:31:52,933
(Question/Did you make the final call?)
so every move of mine

708
00:31:53,033 --> 00:31:55,300
would get under his microscope.

709
00:31:55,400 --> 00:31:57,000
However, for me

710
00:31:57,100 --> 00:31:58,500
I would feel...

711
00:31:58,600 --> 00:32:01,433
Sometimes, I just sit there and space out

712
00:32:01,533 --> 00:32:03,133
without having too many emotions.

713
00:32:03,233 --> 00:32:07,867
In that case, I have to interact with him.

714
00:32:07,951 --> 00:32:09,651
Even if we end up together

715
00:32:09,767 --> 00:32:13,300
it might be a tough road ahead.

716
00:32:14,433 --> 00:32:17,367
For me, honestly.

717
00:32:17,467 --> 00:32:21,300
Bobo's stability and values

718
00:32:21,400 --> 00:32:23,033
are more compatible.

719
00:32:23,133 --> 00:32:26,733
It is a state

720
00:32:26,833 --> 00:32:28,000
of stability.

721
00:32:30,367 --> 00:32:31,500
Something happened yesterday.

722
00:32:31,600 --> 00:32:35,100
When I was alone with Guan-Yu

723
00:32:35,200 --> 00:32:36,167
he would keep mumbling.

724
00:32:36,333 --> 00:32:38,100
(Inside the tent last night)
about how cute he was.

725
00:32:38,200 --> 00:32:40,100
He looks exactly like my ex.

726
00:32:40,200 --> 00:32:42,167
Even when Jia-Hang was drunk yesterday.

727
00:32:42,267 --> 00:32:43,433
He went back to sleep.

728
00:32:43,600 --> 00:32:45,167
(Dinner time last night) I'll go check
on him since he's gone for a while.

729
00:32:45,267 --> 00:32:46,067
Who?

730
00:32:46,167 --> 00:32:48,833
Jia-Hang.

731
00:32:53,300 --> 00:32:54,800
I'm not jealous, but I think he doesn't...

732
00:32:54,900 --> 00:32:56,700
He's still a kid

733
00:32:56,800 --> 00:32:58,533
I don't think he is ready

734
00:32:58,633 --> 00:33:02,067
to move on to the next stage.

735
00:33:06,067 --> 00:33:07,333
I have this urge to protect him

736
00:33:07,433 --> 00:33:09,833
because he's been through so much.

737
00:33:09,933 --> 00:33:11,133
It's tough for him.

738
00:33:11,467 --> 00:33:17,533
(Question/Did you make the final call?)

739
00:33:17,633 --> 00:33:19,667
A tough call

740
00:33:19,767 --> 00:33:21,600
I've got a few minutes to think it through.

741
00:33:31,967 --> 00:33:34,533
About...

742
00:33:47,933 --> 00:33:51,467
(The end of this six-day journey is finally near...)

743
00:33:54,467 --> 00:33:57,600
(Church In The Wind)

744
00:33:58,167 --> 00:34:04,367
(Whose heartfelt thoughts will be
heard at the Church In The Wind?)

745
00:34:12,533 --> 00:34:15,267
(Bobo)

746
00:34:16,600 --> 00:34:18,767
(Shi-Fung)

747
00:34:20,300 --> 00:34:22,800
(NIO)

748
00:34:22,900 --> 00:34:25,533
(Gino)

749
00:34:27,000 --> 00:34:29,000
(Guan-Yu)

750
00:34:30,800 --> 00:34:32,600
(Eri)

751
00:34:34,200 --> 00:34:36,567
(Susu)

752
00:34:38,133 --> 00:34:41,033
(Jia-Hang)

753
00:35:07,233 --> 00:35:07,567
Hello, everyone.

754
00:35:07,667 --> 00:35:09,388
(Pastor Joseph Chang, a gay Christian, founded
the True Light Gospel Church. He has been

755
00:35:09,412 --> 00:35:11,133
dedicated to LGBTQ-friendly initiatives and
is in a long-term marriage with his partner)

756
00:35:11,633 --> 00:35:15,267
I'm Joseph Chang from True Light Church. I'm
truly grateful for these six days of filming.

757
00:35:15,367 --> 00:35:17,567
This is the final destination

758
00:35:17,667 --> 00:35:19,100
of our journey

759
00:35:19,200 --> 00:35:20,400
I bet it's been a while since you guys

760
00:35:20,500 --> 00:35:24,000
spent this much time
getting to know someone.

761
00:35:24,100 --> 00:35:26,100
Whatever the result is today

762
00:35:26,200 --> 00:35:27,967
I believe your interactions
with fellow members

763
00:35:28,067 --> 00:35:31,100
during these couple of days

764
00:35:31,200 --> 00:35:33,100
has given us the privilege to understand

765
00:35:33,200 --> 00:35:36,333
the worth and love of ourselves.

766
00:35:36,433 --> 00:35:39,267
Whatever the result is today

767
00:35:39,367 --> 00:35:41,467
we will cherish this moment

768
00:35:41,567 --> 00:35:45,133
those beautiful memories and interactions

769
00:35:45,233 --> 00:35:47,633
that were created on this adventure

770
00:35:47,733 --> 00:35:51,900
so that we get to love
harder and be braver.

771
00:35:55,433 --> 00:35:56,467
Bobo.

772
00:35:56,567 --> 00:35:58,233
Yes.

773
00:35:58,309 --> 00:35:59,409
During these few days, thank you

774
00:35:59,533 --> 00:36:03,067
for not suppressing yourself
and opening up your heart.

775
00:36:03,167 --> 00:36:04,400
Eri.

776
00:36:05,533 --> 00:36:08,167
You have a way of bringing people happiness

777
00:36:08,267 --> 00:36:10,633
I hope you get to find your own happiness.

778
00:36:12,400 --> 00:36:14,100
Shi-Fung.

779
00:36:14,200 --> 00:36:17,933
What a great show
with that chair last night.

780
00:36:18,033 --> 00:36:19,033
Right.

781
00:36:19,133 --> 00:36:20,533
(At the campfire last night) Let's
turn up and dance, shall we?

782
00:36:20,617 --> 00:36:22,684
He is a little interested in you.

783
00:36:22,800 --> 00:36:24,467
He is interested in you.

784
00:36:24,567 --> 00:36:26,433
Just give me a break.

785
00:36:27,367 --> 00:36:28,367
I also pray

786
00:36:28,467 --> 00:36:31,600
that you can find your own romantic tempo.

787
00:36:31,700 --> 00:36:32,833
Okay.

788
00:36:32,933 --> 00:36:34,367
Susu.

789
00:36:34,467 --> 00:36:36,500
Even though you get nervous easily

790
00:36:36,600 --> 00:36:39,100
you'd panic in front of a crowd

791
00:36:39,200 --> 00:36:40,967
congratulations

792
00:36:41,067 --> 00:36:43,467
you've overcome this with courage.

793
00:36:43,567 --> 00:36:45,600
- Well done.
- Thanks.

794
00:36:45,700 --> 00:36:47,500
Jia-Hang.

795
00:36:47,600 --> 00:36:50,933
Thank you for facing your insecurities

796
00:36:51,033 --> 00:36:54,333
and sticking around
with everyone till this second.

797
00:36:54,433 --> 00:36:55,833
Thank you.

798
00:36:55,933 --> 00:36:57,333
NIO

799
00:36:57,433 --> 00:37:00,600
You entered the scene
like a prince charming

800
00:37:00,700 --> 00:37:01,667
but everyone is aware

801
00:37:01,767 --> 00:37:03,333
underneath that handsome face

802
00:37:03,433 --> 00:37:07,333
you are more than
willing to share your heart.

803
00:37:07,433 --> 00:37:09,233
Your face gives no clue

804
00:37:09,333 --> 00:37:12,633
but Gino, you are the
oldest one among them.

805
00:37:12,733 --> 00:37:16,167
You've gained quite a
fanbase on Instagram

806
00:37:16,267 --> 00:37:17,933
but everyone knows

807
00:37:18,033 --> 00:37:22,600
your heart is as genuine as a kid.

808
00:37:22,700 --> 00:37:25,300
Guan-Yu.

809
00:37:25,400 --> 00:37:28,467
Thank you for taking
care of these big brothers.

810
00:37:28,567 --> 00:37:30,733
Hurting someone is your last intention.

811
00:37:30,833 --> 00:37:32,800
We both know that.

812
00:37:32,900 --> 00:37:36,200
Alright, next up, it is time

813
00:37:36,300 --> 00:37:39,100
to reveal the results

814
00:37:39,200 --> 00:37:42,267
I invite one of you to the
stage to play your recordings.

815
00:37:42,367 --> 00:37:44,039
(Rule /At last, play the recorded messages
and announce the selected pairs.

816
00:37:44,063 --> 00:37:45,867
If both recordings end with them calling each
other's names, it's a successful match)

817
00:37:45,967 --> 00:37:49,400
Remember each one of you recorded a message?
At the end, you revealed the final result.

818
00:37:49,967 --> 00:37:51,333
If your name

819
00:37:51,433 --> 00:37:54,267
gets called out in the recordings

820
00:37:54,367 --> 00:37:57,267
I will invite you to this stage later.

821
00:37:57,367 --> 00:38:00,167
First and foremost, Gino.

822
00:38:06,700 --> 00:38:13,067
(Question/Did you make the final call?)

823
00:38:13,167 --> 00:38:14,033
Okay.

824
00:38:14,133 --> 00:38:17,233
During these short six days

825
00:38:17,333 --> 00:38:20,333
I got two gifts.

826
00:38:20,433 --> 00:38:24,267
One is the bag
I made with Guan-Yu on day one.

827
00:38:24,367 --> 00:38:25,333
Leaf prints.

828
00:38:28,567 --> 00:38:31,700
As for the bag that Gino made

829
00:38:31,800 --> 00:38:33,567
how would you score?

830
00:38:33,667 --> 00:38:34,733
Nine points.

831
00:38:34,833 --> 00:38:36,900
It's high, because he
put lots of effort into it

832
00:38:37,000 --> 00:38:39,000
I'm blushing.

833
00:38:39,833 --> 00:38:42,667
Fine, I hugged Guan-Yu on purpose.

834
00:38:48,433 --> 00:38:50,233
I want to go out with him

835
00:38:50,333 --> 00:38:53,067
which is to follow my heart

836
00:38:53,200 --> 00:38:55,267
3 2 1

837
00:38:57,233 --> 00:38:58,400
Stop staring at me.

838
00:39:01,400 --> 00:39:05,433
Please choose the
tent you'd like to live in.

839
00:39:08,533 --> 00:39:10,167
I seriously thought about dating Guan-Yu

840
00:39:10,267 --> 00:39:12,133
but after these things happened

841
00:39:12,233 --> 00:39:14,267
I don't think he is...

842
00:39:14,367 --> 00:39:16,400
that he is ready to...

843
00:39:18,900 --> 00:39:20,233
be in a relationship.

844
00:39:21,167 --> 00:39:27,100
What's your take on
long-distance relationships?

845
00:39:27,200 --> 00:39:30,567
Honestly, I'm quite okay
with long distance ones.

846
00:39:30,667 --> 00:39:34,667
I've never had a long-distancce
relationship.

847
00:39:34,767 --> 00:39:37,667
I even consider Taoyuan a long-distance.

848
00:39:37,767 --> 00:39:40,467
Even though you would break it up

849
00:39:40,567 --> 00:39:42,067
or conquer it head-on.

850
00:39:42,167 --> 00:39:44,633
But I've experienced both.

851
00:39:50,333 --> 00:39:53,000
This is the one that Eri and Bobo

852
00:39:53,100 --> 00:39:55,533
made when they went out on a date

853
00:39:55,633 --> 00:39:57,167
I was quite touched.

854
00:40:00,300 --> 00:40:03,300
I really appreciate
him liking me this much.

855
00:40:03,400 --> 00:40:06,300
Because my ideal roommate is my opponent.

856
00:40:10,833 --> 00:40:14,500
Hopefully, we get to be friends.

857
00:40:15,133 --> 00:40:16,467
Yeah, it's up to you.

858
00:40:16,567 --> 00:40:19,567
Well, do you wanna try on the slippers?

859
00:40:20,300 --> 00:40:22,500
After I have a better
understanding of this person

860
00:40:22,600 --> 00:40:25,900
I've realized the values
he stands for matter.

861
00:40:26,000 --> 00:40:29,367
Sometimes, it is possible
to change your perspective

862
00:40:29,467 --> 00:40:31,467
after some time spent together.

863
00:40:46,000 --> 00:40:47,067
Well.

864
00:41:00,333 --> 00:41:04,067
Hi, never thought time passed this fast.

865
00:41:04,167 --> 00:41:05,500
We've spent six days together

866
00:41:05,600 --> 00:41:08,867
I'm very glad to get to know you.

867
00:41:09,500 --> 00:41:11,033
What I see on you

868
00:41:11,133 --> 00:41:17,300
are the precious kindness,
innocence, and energy.

869
00:41:17,400 --> 00:41:22,033
Even if we might do

870
00:41:22,133 --> 00:41:23,333
long distance.

871
00:41:23,433 --> 00:41:29,133
But I believe as long as we understand
each other and are being brave

872
00:41:29,233 --> 00:41:31,567
we would be closer

873
00:41:31,667 --> 00:41:35,700
and create more beautiful memories.

874
00:41:36,267 --> 00:41:38,867
Thanks for all the care during this time.

875
00:41:38,967 --> 00:41:43,033
You've brought me so much laughter,
blushing and touching moments.

876
00:41:43,133 --> 00:41:46,067
You want to learn diving and surfing

877
00:41:46,167 --> 00:41:47,767
and open up a flower shop.

878
00:41:47,867 --> 00:41:48,900
Just go ahead and do

879
00:41:49,000 --> 00:41:51,800
all these things

880
00:41:51,900 --> 00:41:54,233
I will be here when you need me.

881
00:41:54,333 --> 00:41:56,000
Let's keep going.

882
00:41:56,100 --> 00:41:58,200
My final choice is.

883
00:41:58,300 --> 00:41:59,433
Guan-Yu.

884
00:41:59,965 --> 00:42:00,900
(Gino's final decision-Guan-Yu)

885
00:42:01,000 --> 00:42:02,233
Guan-Yu.

886
00:42:03,867 --> 00:42:07,000
I'd like to invite Guan-Yu to the stage.

887
00:42:15,933 --> 00:42:23,800
(Question/Did you make the final call?)

888
00:42:24,933 --> 00:42:28,100
I've never stopped thinking.

889
00:42:29,301 --> 00:42:30,901
It's tough.

890
00:42:31,033 --> 00:42:33,300
But it's been really joyful

891
00:42:33,400 --> 00:42:34,500
to hang out with Gino

892
00:42:34,600 --> 00:42:37,067
I always have a great time with him.

893
00:42:37,200 --> 00:42:38,700
Who did you see at first sight?

894
00:42:38,800 --> 00:42:39,767
I saw you.

895
00:42:39,867 --> 00:42:41,200
It's true, from where I went in.

896
00:42:41,300 --> 00:42:42,867
He seems approachable.

897
00:42:42,967 --> 00:42:45,233
Is there any special moment

898
00:42:45,333 --> 00:42:46,900
that you remember

899
00:42:46,984 --> 00:42:50,251
to be extra warm and touching?

900
00:42:50,367 --> 00:42:51,233
Ringing the bell.

901
00:42:51,867 --> 00:42:52,767
Ringing the bell.

902
00:42:57,367 --> 00:42:58,800
That day, I wanted to go out with Gino

903
00:42:58,900 --> 00:42:59,700
because I wanted to make sure

904
00:42:59,800 --> 00:43:01,567
whether he turned on
his working mode or not.

905
00:43:02,833 --> 00:43:04,600
I'm fine with doing long-distance.

906
00:43:04,715 --> 00:43:08,315
People who can share hardships are precious.

907
00:43:08,400 --> 00:43:09,667
If he only wants to have a great time

908
00:43:09,767 --> 00:43:12,567
anyone can have a great time with you.

909
00:43:16,067 --> 00:43:17,900
I did tell him Jia-Hang is cute

910
00:43:19,233 --> 00:43:22,633
because my love for
Jia-Hang isn't romantic.

911
00:43:22,733 --> 00:43:25,633
It's the desire to care and protect him

912
00:43:25,733 --> 00:43:26,800
so basically it means nothing

913
00:43:27,133 --> 00:43:28,533
- I grind my teeth.
- Okay.

914
00:43:28,633 --> 00:43:30,267
How about we sleep on this side.

915
00:43:30,367 --> 00:43:31,667
Okay, sure

916
00:43:31,767 --> 00:43:33,633
I want to feel your energy.

917
00:43:33,733 --> 00:43:35,267
My energy?

918
00:43:35,367 --> 00:43:37,733
I think being with Gino

919
00:43:37,833 --> 00:43:40,233
provides me the daily happiness.

920
00:43:40,333 --> 00:43:43,533
Yeah, with NIO, on the other hand

921
00:43:43,633 --> 00:43:44,367
is more spiritual.

922
00:43:44,467 --> 00:43:45,667
He gets me with just one look.

923
00:43:45,767 --> 00:43:47,733
He also thinks this feeling is reassuring.

924
00:43:47,833 --> 00:43:49,033
He enjoys it, too.

925
00:43:49,133 --> 00:43:52,900
No need for overly deliberate actions.

926
00:43:53,000 --> 00:43:54,033
If we are being honest here

927
00:43:54,164 --> 00:43:55,731
in terms of lifestyles

928
00:43:55,800 --> 00:43:57,733
mine is much more different from NIO's
rather than Gino's.

929
00:43:57,833 --> 00:43:58,967
Gino has doubts

930
00:43:59,067 --> 00:44:02,700
about long distance and perspectives

931
00:44:02,800 --> 00:44:04,267
or about work.

932
00:44:04,367 --> 00:44:05,933
At the end of the day, don't we all

933
00:44:06,033 --> 00:44:08,667
encounter these issues in a relationship?

934
00:44:08,767 --> 00:44:11,300
You don't even have the
courage to try and change.

935
00:44:11,400 --> 00:44:13,233
How am I gonna believe

936
00:44:13,333 --> 00:44:15,967
that I can fall in love with you?

937
00:44:17,333 --> 00:44:20,033
Hi, I'm Guan-Yu

938
00:44:20,267 --> 00:44:24,300
I'm really glad that I got to know you.

939
00:44:24,400 --> 00:44:26,267
It has been...

940
00:44:26,367 --> 00:44:30,367
a rollercoaster during these six days

941
00:44:30,467 --> 00:44:33,567
I can't guarantee

942
00:44:33,667 --> 00:44:37,733
that I've perfectly figured out

943
00:44:37,833 --> 00:44:40,167
every feeling and emotion of mine

944
00:44:40,267 --> 00:44:42,000
and that I've handled them well.

945
00:44:44,733 --> 00:44:46,167
Gosh.

946
00:44:50,267 --> 00:44:53,300
Or have I misunderstood Gino?

947
00:44:53,372 --> 00:44:56,133
Perhaps he wasn't thinking with his head.

948
00:44:56,233 --> 00:44:57,733
He was just drunk.

949
00:44:59,700 --> 00:45:02,200
It's been fun hanging out with you

950
00:45:02,300 --> 00:45:03,967
and I enjoy it

951
00:45:04,067 --> 00:45:09,100
when you share your life and your experiences.

952
00:45:10,367 --> 00:45:12,400
There's one thing I like
when going out with you

953
00:45:12,500 --> 00:45:13,167
on a date.

954
00:45:13,267 --> 00:45:15,800
You love to pretend to be mature.

955
00:45:15,900 --> 00:45:17,000
The truth is, inside you

956
00:45:17,100 --> 00:45:20,633
there is a young kid living in there.

957
00:45:20,733 --> 00:45:25,267
You love to act like a childish kid

958
00:45:25,367 --> 00:45:27,300
like grabbing my penis

959
00:45:27,400 --> 00:45:30,333
or peeking at me in a dirty way

960
00:45:30,433 --> 00:45:31,933
but I feel like

961
00:45:32,033 --> 00:45:33,633
those cute little differences

962
00:45:33,710 --> 00:45:35,744
I find them adorable.

963
00:45:35,867 --> 00:45:37,767
Or it is possible

964
00:45:37,867 --> 00:45:39,733
you are not as mature

965
00:45:39,833 --> 00:45:40,767
as you think you are.

966
00:45:40,867 --> 00:45:42,733
It's fine, though

967
00:45:42,833 --> 00:45:44,367
I hope you can be yourself

968
00:45:44,467 --> 00:45:48,367
and show your best self.

969
00:45:48,467 --> 00:45:53,267
Hopefully, we can stay in touch in the future

970
00:45:53,367 --> 00:45:58,700
and keep doing the exercise we both love.

971
00:45:59,691 --> 00:46:00,615
The person I choose is...

972
00:46:00,700 --> 00:46:01,600
Gino.

973
00:46:02,900 --> 00:46:04,200
(Guan-Yu's final decision - Gino)
Congratulations.

974
00:46:08,367 --> 00:46:10,400
I talked to Guan-Yu this morning

975
00:46:10,500 --> 00:46:13,300
and learned that they had some differences.

976
00:46:13,400 --> 00:46:15,567
However, no matter
what they've been through

977
00:46:15,667 --> 00:46:17,967
they might need a moment to chill.

978
00:46:18,067 --> 00:46:20,767
Seeing them standing together at the end

979
00:46:20,867 --> 00:46:23,200
touches my heart.

980
00:46:24,138 --> 00:46:28,438
(Successfully Matched
Guan-Yu ♥ Gino)

981
00:46:30,967 --> 00:46:33,200
Quite similar to what I expected

982
00:46:33,300 --> 00:46:34,733
I hope the best for them,

983
00:46:34,833 --> 00:46:36,133
and I want to thank Gino

984
00:46:36,233 --> 00:46:38,667
for making me feel this affection toward him.

985
00:46:38,767 --> 00:46:41,133
There is no existing jealousy

986
00:46:41,233 --> 00:46:44,433
and any other hard feelings

987
00:46:44,533 --> 00:46:46,100
I am genuinely happy

988
00:46:46,200 --> 00:46:48,600
for Gino and Guan-Yu.

989
00:46:50,133 --> 00:46:52,000
Still to this moment, it is somewhat

990
00:46:52,100 --> 00:46:53,300
unbelievable to me.

991
00:46:53,400 --> 00:46:55,933
During this whole time
he's been taking care of me like a brother

992
00:46:56,033 --> 00:46:57,967
and I've found

993
00:46:58,067 --> 00:47:00,533
that he also needs
someone to do that for him

994
00:47:00,633 --> 00:47:04,600
I'm glad I get to be with him for six days.

995
00:47:04,700 --> 00:47:06,600
The future is always uncertain.

996
00:47:06,700 --> 00:47:09,500
Distance might be the issue
Age might be the issue.

997
00:47:09,600 --> 00:47:11,733
Work might be the issue, but

998
00:47:12,700 --> 00:47:14,000
loving you is not an issue.

999
00:47:15,467 --> 00:47:17,267
I'm more like a love-at-first-sight person.

1000
00:47:17,367 --> 00:47:18,233
You are?

1001
00:47:18,333 --> 00:47:19,967
How come you didn't tell me?

1002
00:47:20,067 --> 00:47:22,000
Now I'm telling you.

1003
00:47:22,100 --> 00:47:23,300
When I saw you for the first time

1004
00:47:23,400 --> 00:47:26,000
you were giving me this handsome

1005
00:47:26,100 --> 00:47:29,833
cute and innocent vibe.

1006
00:47:29,933 --> 00:47:31,733
After we went out a couple of times

1007
00:47:31,833 --> 00:47:32,933
I felt like

1008
00:47:33,033 --> 00:47:36,667
this kid deserves some attention and care.

1009
00:47:36,767 --> 00:47:37,533
He deserves it.

1010
00:47:41,233 --> 00:47:43,484
(Rule/Heartfelt messages left unspoken...
Recordings without a successful match

1011
00:47:43,508 --> 00:47:45,933
won't be revealed, but it's up to you
whether to share your own messages publicly)

1012
00:47:53,800 --> 00:47:56,567
I don't think he would choose me

1013
00:47:56,667 --> 00:47:57,600
I think he is someone

1014
00:47:57,700 --> 00:47:59,133
who likes to explore every human being

1015
00:47:59,233 --> 00:48:00,300
to get to know everybody.

1016
00:48:00,400 --> 00:48:03,000
He could only make the call after a while

1017
00:48:03,100 --> 00:48:04,967
to see whether he likes him or not

1018
00:48:05,067 --> 00:48:08,233
I'm pretty sure he likes me as a person.

1019
00:48:08,333 --> 00:48:10,867
Yeah, as for the romantic kind

1020
00:48:10,967 --> 00:48:13,467
I don't think so.

1021
00:48:15,067 --> 00:48:19,500
Honestly, this is something.

1022
00:48:19,600 --> 00:48:20,500
Everyone knows this.

1023
00:48:20,600 --> 00:48:24,400
This is the truth everyone is aware

1024
00:48:24,500 --> 00:48:25,867
and.

1025
00:48:27,600 --> 00:48:30,867
I don't think I've given

1026
00:48:32,000 --> 00:48:35,400
this man a fair chance to get to know me.

1027
00:48:39,333 --> 00:48:40,267
Hi.

1028
00:48:40,367 --> 00:48:42,800
First of all, I want to thank you

1029
00:48:42,900 --> 00:48:47,700
for taking care of someone I care

1030
00:48:47,800 --> 00:48:49,200
the most on this show.

1031
00:48:49,300 --> 00:48:52,867
You've given him so much strength

1032
00:48:52,967 --> 00:48:55,033
even though I was
blind to this fact at first.

1033
00:48:55,140 --> 00:49:00,207
Later, I've realized you're sunshine, too.

1034
00:49:00,300 --> 00:49:03,133
Initially, I basically told everyone

1035
00:49:03,233 --> 00:49:04,467
(confused)
I thought you were holding back.

1036
00:49:04,567 --> 00:49:06,700
You weren't being yourself.

1037
00:49:06,800 --> 00:49:09,600
You were hard to approach

1038
00:49:09,700 --> 00:49:11,433
so I had no interests in approaching you.

1039
00:49:14,033 --> 00:49:16,567
I'd choose Bobo.

1040
00:49:16,667 --> 00:49:18,600
Surprise.

1041
00:49:18,700 --> 00:49:20,433
You thought I'd choose Guan-Yu.

1042
00:49:21,600 --> 00:49:25,567
From how you assisted this person

1043
00:49:25,667 --> 00:49:27,533
the person I care a lot about

1044
00:49:27,633 --> 00:49:30,600
I've found out, the truth is

1045
00:49:30,700 --> 00:49:32,067
you are a loving person.

1046
00:49:32,167 --> 00:49:32,900
Not only that

1047
00:49:33,000 --> 00:49:36,000
you have a really kind heart.

1048
00:49:36,100 --> 00:49:37,000
At first, I had trouble understanding him

1049
00:49:37,100 --> 00:49:38,700
understanding his words.

1050
00:49:38,800 --> 00:49:41,333
Yeah, later I was figuring out

1051
00:49:41,433 --> 00:49:45,233
what he said in the recording.

1052
00:49:45,333 --> 00:49:47,967
He said he wanted to thank Bobo

1053
00:49:48,067 --> 00:49:50,400
for taking care of this important person.

1054
00:49:50,500 --> 00:49:55,300
Is he talking about me?
Then I found out

1055
00:49:55,400 --> 00:49:58,233
he did care about me.

1056
00:49:58,333 --> 00:50:00,833
Well, I guess it's good news.

1057
00:50:01,333 --> 00:50:05,867
When you really learned how to be yourself

1058
00:50:05,967 --> 00:50:07,767
learned not to hold back

1059
00:50:07,867 --> 00:50:10,667
learned to say what was on your mind

1060
00:50:10,767 --> 00:50:12,367
to be honest.

1061
00:50:12,467 --> 00:50:14,533
You do have a positive influence.

1062
00:50:14,633 --> 00:50:16,567
It is quite a shame

1063
00:50:16,667 --> 00:50:17,567
I only got to see this side

1064
00:50:17,667 --> 00:50:21,733
of you on the last one or two days.

1065
00:50:21,833 --> 00:50:23,467
The real you.

1066
00:50:23,567 --> 00:50:26,300
During the last two days

1067
00:50:26,408 --> 00:50:31,408
it's obvious that he's
opened up so much more.

1068
00:50:31,725 --> 00:50:33,025
Yeah.

1069
00:50:33,133 --> 00:50:34,933
- You caught it?
- It's dead.

1070
00:50:35,033 --> 00:50:35,767
How's that, huh?

1071
00:50:35,867 --> 00:50:37,767
Gosh, being roommates with me...

1072
00:50:37,867 --> 00:50:40,000
It really is my pleasure.

1073
00:50:40,100 --> 00:50:42,567
He makes jokes and he is humorous.

1074
00:50:42,667 --> 00:50:44,733
Also, he is good at helping people.

1075
00:50:44,833 --> 00:50:46,433
The qualities he's demonstrated so far

1076
00:50:46,533 --> 00:50:49,033
are surprisingly incredible.

1077
00:50:50,667 --> 00:50:52,633
If there's a chance in the future

1078
00:50:52,733 --> 00:50:53,967
or interested in one

1079
00:50:54,067 --> 00:50:57,200
I can get to know you better

1080
00:50:57,300 --> 00:50:59,533
and we can hang out together

1081
00:50:59,633 --> 00:51:01,500
have a drink or two.

1082
00:51:01,600 --> 00:51:03,000
Alright.

1083
00:51:03,100 --> 00:51:04,800
My final choice is Bobo.

1084
00:51:05,133 --> 00:51:07,967
(NIO's final decision is - Bobo)

1085
00:51:08,067 --> 00:51:10,033
Thanks NIO for sharing.

1086
00:51:11,867 --> 00:51:13,733
I'm not sure about NIO, though.

1087
00:51:13,833 --> 00:51:16,700
The person he's describing
doesn't seem to be me

1088
00:51:16,800 --> 00:51:18,667
plus we aren't that close

1089
00:51:18,759 --> 00:51:20,759
I mean, I haven't talked
that much with him.

1090
00:51:20,867 --> 00:51:23,633
Indeed, he did mention to me

1091
00:51:23,733 --> 00:51:26,467
that he thought I was
boring in the early days.

1092
00:51:26,567 --> 00:51:28,367
Well, I'm pleased

1093
00:51:28,467 --> 00:51:30,633
and thankful that he chose me.

1094
00:51:31,833 --> 00:51:34,600
Since the fact

1095
00:51:34,700 --> 00:51:35,933
that whether I play this or not

1096
00:51:36,033 --> 00:51:38,800
doesn't really matter to me anymore.

1097
00:51:38,900 --> 00:51:42,033
All I want to say is

1098
00:51:42,133 --> 00:51:43,633
during this process, I have already

1099
00:51:43,733 --> 00:51:44,867
learned how to express myself

1100
00:51:44,967 --> 00:51:46,667
so I'd like to express myself again

1101
00:51:46,767 --> 00:51:48,333
express my deepest feelings.

1102
00:51:48,433 --> 00:51:51,400
Whatever the outcome is, I'm gonna play it.

1103
00:51:53,933 --> 00:51:55,700
Hi.

1104
00:51:55,800 --> 00:52:00,600
To be frank, from our first date together

1105
00:52:00,700 --> 00:52:02,400
I knew you were special.

1106
00:52:02,500 --> 00:52:03,967
But if you really have to ask

1107
00:52:04,067 --> 00:52:06,100
why I like you
I couldn't figure it out.

1108
00:52:06,200 --> 00:52:09,233
After all, there is so much
that we haven't talked about still.

1109
00:52:10,000 --> 00:52:11,733
On the first night.

1110
00:52:11,833 --> 00:52:13,100
Eri went ahead and told me

1111
00:52:13,200 --> 00:52:15,100
he'd choose his crush

1112
00:52:15,200 --> 00:52:16,133
I asked him later

1113
00:52:16,233 --> 00:52:17,767
the reason behind this.

1114
00:52:17,875 --> 00:52:19,675
He said, "When you like someone

1115
00:52:19,767 --> 00:52:22,000
you have to express your affection".

1116
00:52:22,100 --> 00:52:24,667
No matter what the outcome is.

1117
00:52:24,767 --> 00:52:28,300
What is your ideal type of person?

1118
00:52:28,400 --> 00:52:30,033
Outdoor activities.

1119
00:52:31,067 --> 00:52:35,433
Someone who can go camping
and traveling with me.

1120
00:52:35,533 --> 00:52:38,333
But I'm scared that I got the wrong idea.

1121
00:52:38,433 --> 00:52:39,167
Because earlier

1122
00:52:39,267 --> 00:52:41,100
I called him, yeah

1123
00:52:41,200 --> 00:52:44,533
I felt like a total fool.

1124
00:52:47,233 --> 00:52:48,433
My hope is

1125
00:52:48,533 --> 00:52:53,800
that we get to be really good friends.

1126
00:52:54,867 --> 00:52:56,333
Like you said

1127
00:52:56,433 --> 00:52:58,400
perhaps being friends is the best option.

1128
00:52:58,500 --> 00:53:00,100
But that's alright.

1129
00:53:00,200 --> 00:53:02,800
However, the truth is

1130
00:53:02,900 --> 00:53:05,900
you were the person
who gave me first love like

1131
00:53:06,000 --> 00:53:07,233
butterflies

1132
00:53:07,333 --> 00:53:09,933
I have zero regrets about everything

1133
00:53:10,033 --> 00:53:11,333
that I have done

1134
00:53:11,433 --> 00:53:13,400
I hope this won't give
you too much pressure.

1135
00:53:13,500 --> 00:53:14,600
Just keep being yourself.

1136
00:53:14,700 --> 00:53:15,867
If there is a chance

1137
00:53:15,967 --> 00:53:17,233
we can get to be more

1138
00:53:17,333 --> 00:53:18,633
if there is no such chance

1139
00:53:18,733 --> 00:53:22,533
we can still be friends.

1140
00:53:22,633 --> 00:53:24,567
Choosing you gives me the excuse to say.

1141
00:53:24,667 --> 00:53:27,367
Yes, I still like you.

1142
00:53:27,467 --> 00:53:31,700
Keep it going, and that's all.

1143
00:53:31,800 --> 00:53:33,233
My final choice is.

1144
00:53:33,333 --> 00:53:34,100
Gino.

1145
00:53:34,900 --> 00:53:38,467
(Bobo's final choice is - Gino)

1146
00:53:52,933 --> 00:53:54,267
Honestly, whether I play this or not

1147
00:53:54,367 --> 00:53:57,667
doesn't matter that much, but

1148
00:53:59,567 --> 00:54:01,567
well, just hear me out, will you.

1149
00:54:07,600 --> 00:54:11,433
Hello, it seems like the final choice today

1150
00:54:11,533 --> 00:54:14,833
during these couple of days

1151
00:54:14,933 --> 00:54:20,167
my emotions haven't been quite stable

1152
00:54:20,267 --> 00:54:22,433
I guess some growth is happening.

1153
00:54:22,533 --> 00:54:26,300
Getting to know you on this journey

1154
00:54:26,400 --> 00:54:30,100
makes me realize I've grown so much

1155
00:54:30,200 --> 00:54:33,767
I get to express myself better.

1156
00:54:34,367 --> 00:54:35,767
(Question/Did you make the final call?)

1157
00:54:35,867 --> 00:54:37,667
Not a thing has changed.

1158
00:54:37,767 --> 00:54:39,100
Not at all.

1159
00:54:39,333 --> 00:54:41,333
Let me do it.

1160
00:54:41,433 --> 00:54:43,033
Initially, I was thinking

1161
00:54:43,133 --> 00:54:46,100
well, this guy seems
to like taking pictures.

1162
00:54:46,200 --> 00:54:48,933
And I kind of love getting photographed.

1163
00:54:49,033 --> 00:54:52,400
Hey, hi, I'm looking for NIO.

1164
00:54:52,500 --> 00:54:54,567
He did this to me during the conversation

1165
00:54:54,667 --> 00:54:56,033
I was blushing a little.

1166
00:54:56,651 --> 00:54:58,351
Who do you wanna be with? Go ahead.

1167
00:54:58,467 --> 00:55:01,533
I... I'm good. You?

1168
00:55:03,533 --> 00:55:04,767
It's you.

1169
00:55:04,867 --> 00:55:05,767
Oh, really?

1170
00:55:05,867 --> 00:55:08,000
The very moment you
helped me with my luggage

1171
00:55:08,100 --> 00:55:08,900
I knew in my gut

1172
00:55:09,000 --> 00:55:11,467
that I was gonna fall for this guy

1173
00:55:11,567 --> 00:55:12,967
I don't know what the future holds

1174
00:55:13,067 --> 00:55:16,600
but I'd appreciate hanging out with you

1175
00:55:16,700 --> 00:55:17,733
in these three days

1176
00:55:19,433 --> 00:55:23,267
I've given you a lot of my first time.

1177
00:55:23,382 --> 00:55:26,782
Normally, I don't have the
nerve to express myself.

1178
00:55:26,820 --> 00:55:30,453
No way am I this straightforward

1179
00:55:30,600 --> 00:55:33,500
telling you why I did what I did

1180
00:55:33,600 --> 00:55:35,833
and every reason behind it.

1181
00:55:36,667 --> 00:55:38,967
But you always show me

1182
00:55:39,067 --> 00:55:41,100
that I am amazing

1183
00:55:41,200 --> 00:55:42,900
and talk to me like that.

1184
00:55:43,000 --> 00:55:46,633
Discussing little trivial things of mine

1185
00:55:46,733 --> 00:55:50,500
makes me so happy to get to know you.

1186
00:55:50,600 --> 00:55:52,300
Whether

1187
00:55:52,400 --> 00:55:56,267
that happiness comes from
an the identity of a friend or love.

1188
00:55:56,367 --> 00:55:58,233
Hanging out with you is comfortable

1189
00:55:58,333 --> 00:56:02,000
I'm happy to reveal who I am

1190
00:56:02,100 --> 00:56:04,733
I hope after I get to know you more

1191
00:56:04,833 --> 00:56:05,767
I'd fall in love with you

1192
00:56:05,867 --> 00:56:08,567
whether falling for you
as a friend or a lover.

1193
00:56:08,667 --> 00:56:10,533
Both are okay.

1194
00:56:10,633 --> 00:56:12,967
Because you are a character in my life

1195
00:56:13,067 --> 00:56:15,700
who is worth

1196
00:56:15,800 --> 00:56:17,800
so much love and much appreciation.

1197
00:56:21,200 --> 00:56:24,833
Today, my final choice is.

1198
00:56:24,933 --> 00:56:26,067
NIO

1199
00:56:26,233 --> 00:56:30,300
(Eri's final choice is - NIO)

1200
00:56:33,733 --> 00:56:34,967
He is someone I would like

1201
00:56:35,067 --> 00:56:36,500
to keep in my life

1202
00:56:36,600 --> 00:56:38,933
I want to tell him to be himself

1203
00:56:39,033 --> 00:56:42,300
and don't listen to those nasty voices.

1204
00:56:42,400 --> 00:56:45,367
Hopefully in the future

1205
00:56:45,467 --> 00:56:49,733
I get to see him shining like a star.

1206
00:56:50,300 --> 00:56:52,267
I think Eri is really brave

1207
00:56:52,367 --> 00:56:54,600
so even if my recording sucks

1208
00:56:54,700 --> 00:56:56,000
I might as well play it to everyone.

1209
00:57:02,767 --> 00:57:06,267
The reason why I chose this person

1210
00:57:06,367 --> 00:57:10,133
actually, on the first two days

1211
00:57:10,233 --> 00:57:12,200
we didn't really cross paths with him.

1212
00:57:12,300 --> 00:57:13,600
During this process

1213
00:57:13,700 --> 00:57:16,633
slowly, we got to talk more

1214
00:57:16,733 --> 00:57:18,400
and I've also realized

1215
00:57:18,500 --> 00:57:20,933
he wasn't this cold-blooded person

1216
00:57:21,033 --> 00:57:24,867
or he wasn't always
feeling anything inside.

1217
00:57:25,100 --> 00:57:26,067
(Question/Did you make the final call?)

1218
00:57:26,167 --> 00:57:27,133
I am so embarrassed right now.

1219
00:57:27,233 --> 00:57:29,633
What I said early days
is completely contrary.

1220
00:57:29,733 --> 00:57:31,567
When I did interviews on the first day

1221
00:57:31,667 --> 00:57:32,933
I revealed he was someone.

1222
00:57:33,033 --> 00:57:35,600
(Susu expressed his thoughts on Bobo on the
first day) who didn't really open himself up.

1223
00:57:35,700 --> 00:57:38,533
There wouldn't be any
further stories between us

1224
00:57:38,633 --> 00:57:39,533
Damn, it's like...

1225
00:57:39,633 --> 00:57:40,700
Here comes this big twist.

1226
00:57:40,815 --> 00:57:42,615
(They had a spark during the
photo shoot) I was totally hooked.

1227
00:57:42,700 --> 00:57:44,300
That very moment changed everything.

1228
00:57:44,400 --> 00:57:45,767
From that very second

1229
00:57:45,867 --> 00:57:47,233
I guess I have been awkward and shy.

1230
00:57:47,333 --> 00:57:47,800
Well, I have no idea

1231
00:57:47,900 --> 00:57:50,967
how to handle everything from then on.

1232
00:57:51,967 --> 00:57:53,067
Are you scared of tickling?

1233
00:57:53,167 --> 00:57:54,233
Not really.

1234
00:57:57,700 --> 00:58:01,733
Eventually, Bobo is my only option.

1235
00:58:01,833 --> 00:58:03,900
There's no way I can't
trick myself out of that.

1236
00:58:04,000 --> 00:58:07,033
Yeah, my heart skipped a beat.

1237
00:58:07,133 --> 00:58:09,567
To simply put

1238
00:58:09,592 --> 00:58:11,592
I got on his hook

1239
00:58:11,767 --> 00:58:13,733
I really do believe

1240
00:58:13,833 --> 00:58:16,800
he has really beautiful eyes.

1241
00:58:16,900 --> 00:58:20,533
Can I use that word? Right.

1242
00:58:20,633 --> 00:58:22,933
When I say beautiful

1243
00:58:23,033 --> 00:58:28,000
I mean the kind that gives you wow.

1244
00:58:28,100 --> 00:58:29,933
Thank god I came to this show

1245
00:58:30,033 --> 00:58:33,167
and I got this opportunity to meet him

1246
00:58:33,267 --> 00:58:37,067
I didn't have high hopes

1247
00:58:37,167 --> 00:58:39,433
that he'd choose at the end of the day.

1248
00:58:39,533 --> 00:58:41,267
But I am looking forward to the possibility

1249
00:58:41,367 --> 00:58:43,733
that after this show

1250
00:58:43,833 --> 00:58:46,067
we could have more chances to hang out

1251
00:58:46,167 --> 00:58:49,033
and to have more conversations.

1252
00:58:49,133 --> 00:58:52,333
And we will see if we
stand a chance from there.

1253
00:58:53,067 --> 00:58:53,700
Anyway, at the end

1254
00:58:53,800 --> 00:58:56,100
my final choice is Bobo.

1255
00:58:56,333 --> 00:58:57,333
(Susu's final choice is - Bobo)

1256
00:58:57,433 --> 00:58:59,167
Thanks.

1257
00:59:02,900 --> 00:59:05,500
He didn't compliment me at that moment.

1258
00:59:05,600 --> 00:59:06,633
This was news to me.

1259
00:59:06,733 --> 00:59:08,933
He told me that I have pretty eyes.

1260
00:59:09,033 --> 00:59:11,100
Well, indeed, I do have pretty eyes.

1261
00:59:13,667 --> 00:59:14,800
At the latter stage, I did notice

1262
00:59:14,900 --> 00:59:17,600
he has been giving me more attention.

1263
00:59:17,700 --> 00:59:21,567
On the other hand, the affection level
toward him has gone up.

1264
00:59:21,667 --> 00:59:23,333
We live nearby, anyway.

1265
00:59:23,433 --> 00:59:25,300
Let's see how this will play out

1266
00:59:25,400 --> 00:59:27,533
and I'll let you know.

1267
00:59:28,900 --> 00:59:34,800
(For those who haven't
revealed their options...)

1268
00:59:37,067 --> 00:59:38,933
I am worried about their responses

1269
00:59:39,033 --> 00:59:41,700
but I have no second doubt about my choice

1270
00:59:41,800 --> 00:59:43,633
I want to choose Guan-Yu.

1271
00:59:43,733 --> 00:59:46,333
Great, he is a wonderful listener

1272
00:59:46,433 --> 00:59:48,600
and a great feedback giver.

1273
00:59:48,700 --> 00:59:50,400
Not because you look like my ex

1274
00:59:50,500 --> 00:59:53,967
but because I appreciate your work.

1275
00:59:54,067 --> 00:59:54,900
How about that?

1276
00:59:55,000 --> 00:59:56,700
You are not a replacement.

1277
00:59:56,800 --> 00:59:58,133
You are you

1278
00:59:58,233 --> 01:00:03,133
I hope you can continue to show love
for my work.

1279
01:00:04,500 --> 01:00:06,167
He said when I was fooling around

1280
01:00:06,267 --> 01:00:07,667
he was just...

1281
01:00:07,767 --> 01:00:09,200
he helped fixing my hair

1282
01:00:09,300 --> 01:00:11,000
I was right beside him and said

1283
01:00:11,100 --> 01:00:12,367
I felt so secure

1284
01:00:12,467 --> 01:00:14,133
when he was around me.

1285
01:00:14,233 --> 01:00:15,567
Even though I have no memory of this.

1286
01:00:15,667 --> 01:00:16,767
It came to me

1287
01:00:16,867 --> 01:00:19,400
that perhaps this is a
moment when my heart flutters.

1288
01:00:19,500 --> 01:00:22,333
(Jia-Hang's final choice - Guan-Yu)
If I get to know Guan-Yu a little more

1289
01:00:22,433 --> 01:00:23,600
not that we have to date

1290
01:00:23,700 --> 01:00:24,567
or do anything specifically

1291
01:00:24,667 --> 01:00:27,233
just get to know him better as a friend.

1292
01:00:30,833 --> 01:00:32,033
If it was me in the past

1293
01:00:32,133 --> 01:00:33,733
before I ran into him

1294
01:00:33,833 --> 01:00:35,733
I'd choose no one

1295
01:00:35,833 --> 01:00:37,367
because I wanted to take my time

1296
01:00:37,467 --> 01:00:40,700
to make myself and him comfortable

1297
01:00:40,800 --> 01:00:42,933
I cherish our friendship

1298
01:00:43,033 --> 01:00:45,100
no matter what this friendship means.

1299
01:00:45,200 --> 01:00:47,000
Because of this encounter

1300
01:00:47,100 --> 01:00:48,700
he told me once that.

1301
01:00:48,800 --> 01:00:51,600
You didn't really take the chance.

1302
01:00:51,700 --> 01:00:54,067
- But.
- Because you are afraid to take one

1303
01:00:54,167 --> 01:00:55,233
so you didn't choose

1304
01:00:55,333 --> 01:00:56,667
the person who was on your mind.

1305
01:00:56,767 --> 01:00:58,067
He thought I could

1306
01:00:58,167 --> 01:01:01,500
I could wait for him under that streetlight

1307
01:01:01,600 --> 01:01:04,533
but it is his business of whether he'd walk

1308
01:01:04,633 --> 01:01:05,867
to the streetlight or not.

1309
01:01:05,967 --> 01:01:07,300
There's no need to be scared

1310
01:01:07,400 --> 01:01:08,900
I didn't have the
courage to walk over there

1311
01:01:09,000 --> 01:01:11,567
even if you wanted to meet him.

1312
01:01:12,100 --> 01:01:14,100
Cheers.

1313
01:01:15,067 --> 01:01:17,033
It's nice to be the passenger.

1314
01:01:22,667 --> 01:01:23,833
So thank you

1315
01:01:23,933 --> 01:01:26,300
for teaching me how to
appreciate my spontaneity

1316
01:01:26,400 --> 01:01:28,800
meanwhile, how to be able

1317
01:01:28,900 --> 01:01:30,333
take my time in this world.

1318
01:01:36,033 --> 01:01:39,867
(Shi-Fung's final choice is - NIO)
So my final choice is NIO.

1319
01:01:43,767 --> 01:01:47,500
Let's give it up to Guan-Yu and Gino.

1320
01:01:53,933 --> 01:01:55,233
I'm actually quite touched.

1321
01:01:55,333 --> 01:01:57,567
What I want to encourage them

1322
01:01:57,667 --> 01:02:00,600
is to say it out loud
when they like something

1323
01:02:00,700 --> 01:02:01,733
and things they don't like.

1324
01:02:01,833 --> 01:02:03,567
Have the courage to be themselves

1325
01:02:03,667 --> 01:02:06,767
and go after what they want.

1326
01:02:08,975 --> 01:02:10,842
Apart from knowing so many friends

1327
01:02:10,867 --> 01:02:14,033
I've gained so much knowledge of myself

1328
01:02:14,133 --> 01:02:17,000
I start to gain insights
of how I interact with people

1329
01:02:17,100 --> 01:02:20,667
from the lens of a
third-person perspective.

1330
01:02:21,100 --> 01:02:22,667
Seven of them are good guys.

1331
01:02:22,767 --> 01:02:24,967
There's simply no room for scheming

1332
01:02:25,067 --> 01:02:26,300
or perhaps the desire

1333
01:02:26,400 --> 01:02:29,700
to completely destroy another person

1334
01:02:29,800 --> 01:02:31,400
I am already content

1335
01:02:31,500 --> 01:02:32,933
that I get to be here.

1336
01:02:33,333 --> 01:02:34,733
To know myself better

1337
01:02:34,833 --> 01:02:36,800
and I got what I wanted

1338
01:02:36,900 --> 01:02:39,733
I didn't get matched at this point.

1339
01:02:39,833 --> 01:02:41,500
That doesn't mean I'm not ready for it.

1340
01:02:41,600 --> 01:02:45,600
That means I could carry
a loving attitude in me

1341
01:02:45,700 --> 01:02:49,033
and keep myself
company for a while longer.

1342
01:02:49,133 --> 01:02:52,200
The eight of us are like the chosen ones.

1343
01:02:52,300 --> 01:02:56,300
We've created this magical spark

1344
01:02:56,400 --> 01:03:00,167
which allowed me to make some adjustments

1345
01:03:00,267 --> 01:03:02,967
to the distance between
me and everyone else.

1346
01:03:03,233 --> 01:03:04,367
Even though the show's intention

1347
01:03:04,467 --> 01:03:07,567
is to find someone we like for us

1348
01:03:07,667 --> 01:03:08,633
and get matched up eventually.

1349
01:03:08,733 --> 01:03:10,333
There's a short slogan.

1350
01:03:10,433 --> 01:03:13,467
Like we are back to being students

1351
01:03:13,567 --> 01:03:15,167
the feeling of getting electrified by love

1352
01:03:15,267 --> 01:03:16,767
I've truly found

1353
01:03:16,867 --> 01:03:18,700
this feeling in the show

1354
01:03:18,800 --> 01:03:21,300
even if it leads to nowhere

1355
01:03:21,400 --> 01:03:22,800
I've harvested more ways

1356
01:03:22,900 --> 01:03:24,767
for me to let my emotions out

1357
01:03:24,867 --> 01:03:27,900
plus another precious friend.

1358
01:03:28,000 --> 01:03:29,200
If it weren't for Eri today

1359
01:03:29,300 --> 01:03:32,300
I would never be able
to have this discovery

1360
01:03:32,423 --> 01:03:34,590
I'd appreciate the show for choosing me

1361
01:03:34,667 --> 01:03:38,033
and Eri for the support on this journey.

1362
01:03:38,167 --> 01:03:39,733
Thank you guys for having me here

1363
01:03:39,833 --> 01:03:43,267
I'd like to say the world
is not monotonous.

1364
01:03:43,367 --> 01:03:44,933
Our world is wonderful.

1365
01:03:45,033 --> 01:03:47,300
Rainbows consist of seven colors.

1366
01:03:47,400 --> 01:03:49,667
You don't have to just
like (one color like) red.

1367
01:03:49,767 --> 01:03:51,133
Yeah, we have to gather all colors

1368
01:03:51,233 --> 01:03:53,433
That's the way that light works.

1369
01:03:53,633 --> 01:03:55,333
It never occurs to me originally

1370
01:03:55,433 --> 01:03:58,233
that I'd pour out the things

1371
01:03:58,333 --> 01:04:00,933
hidden deep inside my heart.

1372
01:04:01,033 --> 01:04:02,467
After I pouted them all out

1373
01:04:02,567 --> 01:04:04,700
I felt amazing.

1374
01:04:04,800 --> 01:04:06,467
Like, I'm not that complicated

1375
01:04:06,567 --> 01:04:09,733
at the end of the day.

1376
01:04:09,833 --> 01:04:11,600
After I took part in this show

1377
01:04:11,700 --> 01:04:13,367
I found out they didn't fool around.

1378
01:04:13,467 --> 01:04:17,533
We've created a loving and peaceful place

1379
01:04:17,633 --> 01:04:19,300
for everyone to be loved

1380
01:04:19,400 --> 01:04:20,833
and to be blessed

1381
01:04:35,900 --> 01:04:36,467
2 3

1382
01:04:38,667 --> 01:04:40,367
Thanks.

1383
01:04:40,467 --> 01:04:42,633
Thanks, guys

1384
01:04:42,733 --> 01:04:44,767
I'd appreciate it
