I really like you guys.

5
00:00:15,100 --> 00:00:17,133
You've given me a couple of fun days.

6
00:00:17,233 --> 00:00:19,300
Thanks you for giving me this memory

7
00:00:19,400 --> 00:00:20,633
I'd appreciate it.

(Question/How would you cast the
"leave vote"?) I have to give an answer?

24
00:01:28,267 --> 00:01:29,967
I'm kind of struggling.

25
00:01:32,633 --> 00:01:34,800
(Question/How would you cast the "leave vote"?)
Even one vote counts?

26
00:01:42,267 --> 00:01:43,233
I don't think I could cast my vote.

27
00:01:43,333 --> 00:01:45,567
I think I'd vote myself.

28
00:01:45,867 --> 00:01:48,600
Whether someone leaves or not

29
00:01:48,700 --> 00:01:50,467
it shouldn't be up to me to decide.

30
00:01:50,567 --> 00:01:51,500
That's why I decide

31
00:01:51,600 --> 00:01:52,833
if I have this chance to vote

32
00:01:52,933 --> 00:01:54,233
I'd vote for myself

33
00:01:54,333 --> 00:01:56,967
because I already got what I wanted.

34
00:02:03,567 --> 00:02:05,267
I mean, I lost the will to fight.

35
00:02:05,367 --> 00:02:07,400
and I'm not that confident.

36
00:02:07,500 --> 00:02:10,233
Plus, I don't have a
particularly strong position,

37
00:02:10,333 --> 00:02:12,100
so I'd vote for myself.

38
00:02:15,267 --> 00:02:17,233
I don't want it to be a vote.

39
00:02:17,333 --> 00:02:19,833
This is something I don't want to see.

40
00:02:19,933 --> 00:02:21,000
Including myself

41
00:02:21,100 --> 00:02:22,433
because the first person

42
00:02:22,533 --> 00:02:24,133
and the last person I think about is me

43
00:02:24,233 --> 00:02:26,433
I truly don't want to leave

44
00:02:26,533 --> 00:02:28,733
this group of people.

45
00:02:29,333 --> 00:02:32,430

(Question/How would you cast the "stay vote"?)
If I'm the one to leave

48
00:02:39,167 --> 00:02:41,733

(Question/How would you cast the "stay
vote"?) I'd like to make Shih-Feng stay.

Let me put it this way.

51
00:02:48,300 --> 00:02:49,500
He gives people positive energy.

52
00:02:49,600 --> 00:02:51,667
It's something really rare.

53
00:02:52,333 --> 00:02:54,067
(Question/How would you
cast the "stay vote"?) I feel like

54
00:02:54,167 --> 00:02:54,967
I trust the eight of us

55
00:02:55,067 --> 00:02:56,600
so I wouldn't cast any vote.

56
00:02:57,767 --> 00:02:59,133
(Question/How would you
cast the "stay vote"?) Bobo.

57
00:02:59,233 --> 00:03:00,933
Because he wanted to leave so bad.

58
00:03:02,233 --> 00:03:04,333
That way, people could have more chances

59
00:03:04,433 --> 00:03:06,133
to get to know him.

60
00:03:06,600 --> 00:03:07,467
(Question/How would
you cast the "stay vote"?)

61
00:03:07,567 --> 00:03:09,467
I'd vote for Shih-Feng.

62
00:03:10,500 --> 00:03:13,233
I don't know probably because
he would also vote for himself.

63
00:03:13,333 --> 00:03:13,833
Yeah.

64
00:03:14,867 --> 00:03:15,767
(Question/How would you cast
the "stay vote"?) I guess Guan.

65
00:03:16,433 --> 00:03:17,267
Because he's cute

66
00:03:17,367 --> 00:03:18,733
and he's a good match with Gino

67
00:03:18,833 --> 00:03:19,767
I think the two of them

68
00:03:19,867 --> 00:03:21,300
look really sweet together.

69
00:03:21,933 --> 00:03:24,200
Well, two people hold special places in my heart.

70
00:03:24,300 --> 00:03:26,467
One is NIO, and the other is Bobo.

71
00:03:26,567 --> 00:03:28,033
Actually, Bobo often tells at me

72
00:03:28,133 --> 00:03:29,967
that he wants to leave

73
00:03:30,067 --> 00:03:31,900
but personally I'm more selfish

74
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:33,533
I don't wanna cut him a break that soon

75
00:03:33,633 --> 00:03:37,200
I'd choose to make Bobo stay.

76
00:03:37,767 --> 00:03:39,400
(Question/How would you cast
the "stay vote"?) I'd vote for me.

77
00:03:39,500 --> 00:03:40,567
If I get to stay

78
00:03:40,667 --> 00:03:42,933
with every single one of them

79
00:03:43,033 --> 00:03:44,800
to finish this whole journey

80
00:03:44,900 --> 00:03:47,233
which will be a better ending.

81
00:03:48,233 --> 00:03:50,833
(The voting is over. Who will leave
this cabin at the end of the night...?)

82
00:04:10,167 --> 00:04:14,167
(Rule/This is my last message to the crowd)
Confirm the result by playing the recording.

83
00:04:14,192 --> 00:04:15,626
This is the last thing he wanted to say.

84
00:04:15,651 --> 00:04:17,307
(Play the recording. The
owner of the voice is about to

85

86
00:04:19,167 --> 00:04:22,067
(Question/If you're free to not cast the vote?)

87
00:04:22,167 --> 00:04:23,233
Can I not vote?

88
00:04:23,900 --> 00:04:25,900
(Question/If you're free to not cast the vote?)
Then I choose not to vote.

89
00:04:26,167 --> 00:04:27,467
(Question/If you're free to not cast the vote?)
Then I won't vote.

90
00:04:28,367 --> 00:04:29,967
(Question/If you're free to not cast the vote?)
Okay, no vote it is.

91
00:04:30,567 --> 00:04:32,567
(Question/If you're free to not cast the vote?)
I decide that no one will leave.

92
00:04:32,733 --> 00:04:33,733
(Question/If you're free to not cast the vote?)
Invalid ballot.

93
00:04:34,467 --> 00:04:37,272
Even though I talk nonsense all
the time saying I wanted to go...

94
00:04:37,296 --> 00:04:40,100
but no, I still wanna hang around. Let
me have fun while the holiday lasts.

95
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:47,900
Hello.

96
00:04:48,500 --> 00:04:49,733
I'm Jia-Hang.

97
00:04:51,567 --> 00:04:56,567
(The Final Result: Leave vote: Jia-Hang 1,
Stay vote: Bobo 3, Shih-Feng 3, Guan-Yu 1)

98
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:00,700
I'm glad that earlier we could

99
00:05:00,800 --> 00:05:03,367
resolve our misunderstandings

100
00:05:03,467 --> 00:05:05,700
and I'm glad I have the luxury

101
00:05:06,033 --> 00:05:08,300
to have you guys tolerate me

102
00:05:08,967 --> 00:05:10,800
and give me so much warmth

103
00:05:10,900 --> 00:05:14,233
to deal with my insecurities.

104
00:05:14,900 --> 00:05:18,167
(Question/Who do you think wants to leave?)
Jia-Hang gives me this impression

105
00:05:18,267 --> 00:05:20,733
that he is a little

106
00:05:20,833 --> 00:05:23,800
uncomfortable in this type of environment

107
00:05:23,900 --> 00:05:27,500
I wouldn't want to force him to stay here

108
00:05:27,600 --> 00:05:29,933
if he doesn't want to be here.

109
00:05:30,767 --> 00:05:32,633
There are eight of us gathering here.

110
00:05:32,733 --> 00:05:35,500
There must be some connection

111
00:05:35,600 --> 00:05:37,133
for us to be here

112
00:05:37,233 --> 00:05:39,667
I hope that our lives may
cross paths again in the future

113
00:05:39,767 --> 00:05:44,067
or that we may have the opportunity to reunite.

114
00:05:44,967 --> 00:05:45,867
(Question/Would you want to stay?)

115
00:05:45,967 --> 00:05:46,700
I wouldn't

116
00:05:46,800 --> 00:05:49,367
I feel like I'm already an outsider.

117
00:05:49,467 --> 00:05:53,467
There is no strength in me to keep myself going.

118
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:57,933
I can see so many brilliant characteristics

119
00:05:58,033 --> 00:06:00,800
on each one of you

120
00:06:00,900 --> 00:06:03,300
I hope I get to be you someday

121
00:06:03,400 --> 00:06:04,500
to be this confident

122
00:06:04,600 --> 00:06:07,800
and face my life with such a force.

123
00:06:08,368 --> 00:06:12,701
Thank you, guys.
Keep on loving.

124
00:06:12,833 --> 00:06:14,967
Be good.

125
00:06:15,067 --> 00:06:16,467
Thanks.

126
00:06:25,932 --> 00:06:28,154
(The production crew
gives Jia-Hang a last chance

127
00:06:28,179 --> 00:06:30,400
to stay; he could decide
whether he stays or not)

128
00:06:30,733 --> 00:06:32,333
I have no idea.

129
00:06:35,700 --> 00:06:36,567
You can decide.

130
00:06:38,659 --> 00:06:40,192
Stop that

131
00:06:40,278 --> 00:06:42,478
- You're being dramatic
- It's fine. It's alright.

132
00:06:42,503 --> 00:06:43,211
(tears streaming)

133
00:06:43,267 --> 00:06:44,933
You are overreacting

134
00:06:45,033 --> 00:06:46,767
I was scared to death when I saw.

135
00:06:46,867 --> 00:06:49,433
Bobo cried like a baby

136
00:06:49,533 --> 00:06:51,700
because Bobo and I had the least

137
00:06:51,800 --> 00:06:52,800
least interactions...

138
00:06:52,900 --> 00:06:54,533
Besides, we weren't really talking

139
00:06:54,633 --> 00:06:56,933
that much on the dinner table.

140
00:06:57,033 --> 00:06:58,833
Next, I glanced at my left side.

141
00:06:59,200 --> 00:07:01,667
Guys, what are you doing?

142
00:07:01,767 --> 00:07:04,467
Hold on, calm down...

143
00:07:06,200 --> 00:07:08,500
I mean, is it that serious?

144
00:07:08,600 --> 00:07:09,700
No way.

145
00:07:09,800 --> 00:07:11,300
This is not that serious

146
00:07:11,400 --> 00:07:13,433
I just feel like,
I feel bad for misunderstanding you.

147
00:07:13,533 --> 00:07:16,600
No worries, as long as we've talked it out.

148
00:07:16,700 --> 00:07:18,100
(What did they mean
by misunderstanding?)

149
00:07:18,200 --> 00:07:20,467
It's alright

150
00:07:20,567 --> 00:07:22,633
I would like to ask

151
00:07:22,733 --> 00:07:25,500
about the roles of each person

152
00:07:25,600 --> 00:07:27,333
I think everyone has a choice not to share.

153
00:07:27,433 --> 00:07:28,500
It's their freedom.

154
00:07:28,600 --> 00:07:31,567
Yeah, I was a little stressed out.

155
00:07:31,667 --> 00:07:34,233
Did you notice I wasn't saying anything?

156
00:07:34,333 --> 00:07:37,467
(Members had the wrong ideas about
Jia-Hang because of some misunderstandings)

157
00:07:37,492 --> 00:07:39,500
I'm scared of Jia-Hang but I don't know why

158
00:07:39,703 --> 00:07:42,367
I don't like straight-out questions
I don't think anyone is interested in me.

159
00:07:42,392 --> 00:07:43,766
It's not easy to talk
about important stuff

160
00:07:43,791 --> 00:07:45,656
(After dinner, they resolved
their wrong ideas about Jia-Hang)

161
00:07:45,833 --> 00:07:47,267
so it must be hard for you.

162
00:07:47,367 --> 00:07:49,867
- But we've also learned something from this.
- Nah, not at all.

163
00:07:49,967 --> 00:07:51,100
Plus, I'm truly grateful

164
00:07:51,200 --> 00:07:52,333
that you're willing to believe us now

165
00:07:52,433 --> 00:07:55,100
- for telling us about this, I mean it.
- Thank God you told us.

166
00:07:55,200 --> 00:07:57,433
- Thank god I did.
- It must be not easy for you.

167
00:07:58,333 --> 00:08:00,967
- It's all good.
- I think you can stay.

168
00:08:01,667 --> 00:08:04,133
Since we're all good now.

169
00:08:04,233 --> 00:08:05,633
If you are happy about it

170
00:08:05,733 --> 00:08:08,100
we can all stay.

171
00:08:08,867 --> 00:08:11,967
But do give yourself some time to think.

172
00:08:12,767 --> 00:08:16,567
I think it all depends on Jia-Hang

173
00:08:16,667 --> 00:08:20,267
- see if you're comfortable with it.
- Whether you feel good about it.

174
00:08:20,367 --> 00:08:22,921
(The rational NIO and Eri remind Jia-Hang
that his feelings are the most important)

175
00:08:22,946 --> 00:08:27,195
If you don't feel comfortable then there
is no need to force yourself to stay here.

176
00:08:28,933 --> 00:08:30,267
Because I've always been someone

177
00:08:30,367 --> 00:08:32,000
who really hates myself

178
00:08:32,100 --> 00:08:33,467
I don't have the courage to face it.

179
00:08:33,567 --> 00:08:35,633
Running away is my only option.

180
00:08:35,733 --> 00:08:37,733
At the moment, I feel like

181
00:08:37,833 --> 00:08:39,833
what if I give myself one more

182
00:08:39,933 --> 00:08:42,067
one more chance to be brave?

183
00:08:42,167 --> 00:08:44,833
Perhaps I get to have a different outcome

184
00:08:44,933 --> 00:08:47,000
because there must be a reason

185
00:08:47,100 --> 00:08:48,700
some sort of a connection

186
00:08:48,800 --> 00:08:50,567
when you chose the eight of us.

187
00:08:50,667 --> 00:08:53,167
If I drop out now

188
00:08:53,267 --> 00:08:55,133
I may have regrets in the future

189
00:08:55,233 --> 00:08:58,300
because I don't have the nerve to be brave.

190
00:08:59,433 --> 00:09:01,533
I think hanging out with you

191
00:09:02,267 --> 00:09:03,600
from that specific moment earlier

192
00:09:03,700 --> 00:09:05,900
when we talked it out.

193
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:10,167
I got rid of a lot of things
when facing you guys

194
00:09:10,900 --> 00:09:13,867
without many burdens on me.

195
00:09:13,967 --> 00:09:14,933
But I still have no clue

196
00:09:15,033 --> 00:09:17,467
of how things will play out next.

197
00:09:18,167 --> 00:09:19,533
However

198
00:09:20,333 --> 00:09:23,067
it is raining now
so I don't feel like leaving.

199
00:09:24,200 --> 00:09:25,733
I hate it when rain falls on me.

200
00:09:29,233 --> 00:09:31,300
I hope I get to stay.

201
00:09:31,400 --> 00:09:33,400
(Jia-Hang decides to vote for himself to stay)
I hope I still have the chance.

202
00:09:34,867 --> 00:09:37,467
To take part in this

203
00:09:37,567 --> 00:09:39,667
wonderful journey with everyone.

204
00:09:41,467 --> 00:09:43,333
I knew he'd vote for himself

205
00:09:43,433 --> 00:09:45,267
I knew it he'd vote for himself

206
00:09:45,367 --> 00:09:48,700
but I didn't vote for anyone

207
00:09:48,800 --> 00:09:50,200
I didn't cast my vote.

208
00:09:50,300 --> 00:09:52,367
That is something only
you can decide for yourself.

209
00:09:52,467 --> 00:09:53,467
So when I heard you said

210
00:09:53,567 --> 00:09:54,600
on your own will, that you wanted to stay

211
00:09:54,700 --> 00:09:56,500
it made my day.

212
00:09:56,600 --> 00:10:01,233
(Guan-Yu didn't vote, simply because he
thought this decision was extremely personal)

213
00:10:03,767 --> 00:10:07,567
Well, we talked a lot during the dinner.

214
00:10:07,667 --> 00:10:09,733
You said you didn't know how to be brave

215
00:10:09,833 --> 00:10:11,700
but I felt like you did it today.

216
00:10:14,667 --> 00:10:17,167
Thank you.

217
00:10:17,267 --> 00:10:18,800
And thank you for trusting us

218
00:10:18,900 --> 00:10:22,567
and for trusting in the things we bring.

219
00:10:23,100 --> 00:10:25,067
I meant what I said earlier.

220
00:10:25,167 --> 00:10:26,367
At a specific moment

221
00:10:26,467 --> 00:10:28,800
you guys caught my insecurities

222
00:10:28,900 --> 00:10:30,492
I mean, it didn't keep falling forever.

223
00:10:30,517 --> 00:10:32,289
(Dinner delved deep into
conversations of regrets,

224
00:10:32,313 --> 00:10:33,867
providing Jia-Hang
the courage to stay...)

225
00:10:33,967 --> 00:10:36,767
I'm so grateful that you were willing

226
00:10:36,867 --> 00:10:40,867
to catch it even just reaching
out the tip of your finger.

227
00:10:41,600 --> 00:10:42,467
Yeah, and

228
00:10:42,567 --> 00:10:44,567
I'm not very adept at expressing
sentimental thoughts.

229
00:10:44,667 --> 00:10:46,633
Always filled with dark thoughts.

230
00:10:47,867 --> 00:10:48,667
Yeah

231
00:10:48,767 --> 00:10:50,167
we are aware of that.

232
00:10:52,567 --> 00:10:54,733
Resolving misunderstandings.

233
00:10:54,833 --> 00:10:56,967
Talk about what makes you uncomfortable

234
00:10:57,067 --> 00:10:59,800
even if you guys can't
keep on being friendly.

235
00:10:59,900 --> 00:11:01,267
However, letting go

236
00:11:01,367 --> 00:11:02,900
that burden inside you

237
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:04,933
is extremely freeing.

238
00:11:05,267 --> 00:11:11,074
(As the possibility of departure
looms, be sure to seize

239
00:11:11,098 --> 00:11:17,433
the moment and it also offers
members a chance to stop)

240
00:11:18,433 --> 00:11:19,667
Thanks.

241
00:11:19,751 --> 00:11:21,072
(If misunderstandings are
cleared and you get the chance

242
00:11:21,112 --> 00:11:22,433
to be brave again let's
finish this journey together!)

243
00:11:22,533 --> 00:11:23,667
I'd appreciate it.

244
00:11:38,967 --> 00:11:40,067
(Gino visits Bobo)

245
00:11:40,167 --> 00:11:41,467
Here to have some fun.

246
00:11:45,392 --> 00:11:47,218
Did I guess it right?

247
00:11:47,243 --> 00:11:49,143
- Guess what right?
- Did I have the right impression?

248
00:11:49,168 --> 00:11:50,578
(Gino wanted to double check his feelings)

249
00:11:50,640 --> 00:11:51,900
Guess what right?

250
00:11:52,267 --> 00:11:54,300
If I say it out loud myself...

251
00:11:57,500 --> 00:11:59,767
It'd be really strange to say the words.

252
00:11:59,867 --> 00:12:02,500
- Well, you guessed it right.
- Umm.

253
00:12:02,600 --> 00:12:04,533
Do you still have something to say?

254
00:12:07,233 --> 00:12:09,000
- You...
- The thing is, what I want to say is

255
00:12:09,100 --> 00:12:11,267
I want to spend more time with you

256
00:12:11,367 --> 00:12:12,833
hanging out with you.

257
00:12:12,933 --> 00:12:15,267
That's what I want to say.

258
00:12:16,933 --> 00:12:18,100
It's just I was a little pissed

259
00:12:18,200 --> 00:12:19,467
but that's fine.

260
00:12:19,567 --> 00:12:23,467
You were pissed because
I didn't choose you?

261
00:12:23,567 --> 00:12:26,300
No, it was normal that you didn't choose me.

262
00:12:26,400 --> 00:12:28,068
(Finally realizing why Bobo avoided the
conversation with Gino this afternoon...)

263
00:12:28,093 --> 00:12:30,433
But the biggest thing I
get to take home with

264
00:12:30,458 --> 00:12:32,392
is the friendship with Eri.

265
00:12:32,567 --> 00:12:35,333
As for how things will play out later

266
00:12:35,433 --> 00:12:37,467
I've gained more sense now

267
00:12:37,567 --> 00:12:40,267
compared to a couple of days ago.

268
00:12:41,133 --> 00:12:42,400
What?

269
00:12:46,200 --> 00:12:50,533
(Double Room/Guan-Yu, NIO)
When I sent out the text today

270
00:12:50,633 --> 00:12:52,300
I was a little anxious.

271
00:12:52,400 --> 00:12:53,733
Why?

272
00:12:53,833 --> 00:12:55,833
I wasn't sure if I'd hurt you.

273
00:12:56,773 --> 00:12:57,945
It was troubling for me.

274
00:12:57,970 --> 00:12:59,570
(Guan-Yu is deeply troubled
about whom to choose)

275
00:12:59,633 --> 00:13:02,279
I understand your position. You had every right to do that.

276
00:13:02,304 --> 00:13:04,554
(Eventually, Guan-Yu
chose Gino instead of NIO)

277
00:13:05,100 --> 00:13:06,300
A little disappointed.

278
00:13:06,400 --> 00:13:08,400
Like I reached out my hand

279
00:13:08,500 --> 00:13:10,033
- and then...
- I know.

280
00:13:10,133 --> 00:13:11,333
You know.

281
00:13:12,867 --> 00:13:15,333
But please don't feel

282
00:13:15,967 --> 00:13:18,433
guilty or feel like you've hurt me.

283
00:13:18,533 --> 00:13:19,700
You didn't hurt me.

284
00:13:19,800 --> 00:13:22,867
It's just being in that position

285
00:13:22,967 --> 00:13:23,567
normally

286
00:13:23,667 --> 00:13:26,467
makes every human being
react the way I reacted.

287
00:13:26,567 --> 00:13:27,733
Because Gino...

288
00:13:28,533 --> 00:13:30,467
I wanted to see if that is his working mode

289
00:13:30,567 --> 00:13:32,033
or he takes me seriously.

290
00:13:32,133 --> 00:13:33,467
If he takes me seriously

291
00:13:33,567 --> 00:13:35,433
it'd be great to get to know him.

292
00:13:35,458 --> 00:13:37,096
(Guan-Yu wanted to check
Gino's feelings through this date)

293
00:13:37,165 --> 00:13:40,221
But if he turns on his working mode I
can get to the bottom of whether or not

294
00:13:40,245 --> 00:13:43,300
he turns on his working mode whether
he treats me as his work or he means it.

295
00:13:43,767 --> 00:13:44,733
On the other hand

296
00:13:44,833 --> 00:13:46,167
if you have feelings for me

297
00:13:46,267 --> 00:13:48,267
you don't want the news to spread too soon.

298
00:13:48,367 --> 00:13:50,900
Yeah, you would have a second thought.

299
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:53,400
In that case, we'll get a lot of attention

300
00:13:53,500 --> 00:13:55,233
if I choose you at that moment.

301
00:13:55,333 --> 00:13:56,967
- A lot of attention.
- First of all, a lot of attention.

302
00:13:57,067 --> 00:13:58,367
Second of all.

303
00:13:58,467 --> 00:14:00,172
(Guan-Yu didn't choose NIO out of
the impact this relationship will bring)

304
00:14:00,197 --> 00:14:01,933
I'm not sure if it'll hurt Shih-Feng.

305
00:14:02,700 --> 00:14:04,800
Yeah, it is possible that he wonders

306
00:14:04,900 --> 00:14:06,667
why we would do such a thing.

307
00:14:06,767 --> 00:14:08,567
So I've given it a lot of thoughts.

308
00:14:09,291 --> 00:14:11,329
(Meanwhile, Gino is expressing
his feelings to Bobo...)

309
00:14:12,142 --> 00:14:14,733
The truth is I hope I
get to be your friend.

310
00:14:14,833 --> 00:14:17,367
Yeah, but it is up to you.

311
00:14:19,400 --> 00:14:21,733
Do you want to try on those slippers?

312
00:14:23,467 --> 00:14:25,767
- Even though it's my story.
- Wanna give it to him that soon?

313
00:14:25,867 --> 00:14:27,233
Yeah, even though it's my story

314
00:14:27,333 --> 00:14:29,167
during this whole show

315
00:14:29,267 --> 00:14:31,133
except in front of the camera

316
00:14:31,233 --> 00:14:33,900
I only shared it with Eri once.

317
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:34,900
Glad I came out at this moment

318
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:35,833
and heard the highlight of your story.

319
00:14:35,933 --> 00:14:38,533
(Bobo made a gift for Gino on the
date with Eri) The story of my cat.

320
00:14:38,633 --> 00:14:40,367
When did you prepare for this?

321
00:14:40,467 --> 00:14:40,933
Today.

322
00:14:41,033 --> 00:14:44,233
We went knitting today.

323
00:14:45,067 --> 00:14:46,800
Actually, I made one for NIO.

324
00:14:46,900 --> 00:14:47,767
We both had a deal

325
00:14:47,867 --> 00:14:50,400
that we'd gift them to our crush.

326
00:14:50,933 --> 00:14:53,467
I want to give it to him privately.

327
00:14:53,567 --> 00:14:54,567
Rather than giving it to him

328
00:14:54,667 --> 00:14:55,700
in front of everyone.

329
00:14:55,800 --> 00:14:57,467
Making him feel him pressured
is the last thing I want.

330
00:14:57,567 --> 00:14:59,600
You know, I'm not asking for any feedback

331
00:14:59,700 --> 00:15:01,967
if I gift something to him.

332
00:15:02,067 --> 00:15:03,433
The reason why I'd give him the slippers

333
00:15:03,533 --> 00:15:05,300
is simply because

334
00:15:05,391 --> 00:15:07,758
his name NIO is written all over

335
00:15:07,867 --> 00:15:10,000
on these slippers.

336
00:15:10,433 --> 00:15:11,500
Yeah.

337
00:15:12,740 --> 00:15:15,707
(Double Room/Guan-Yu, NIO)

338
00:15:16,933 --> 00:15:17,733
It's too big.

339
00:15:17,833 --> 00:15:19,167
This is for you.

340
00:15:19,467 --> 00:15:20,833
Umm, well, this is.

341
00:15:20,933 --> 00:15:23,100
(Eri brought his present to NIO)
Bobo and I went on a date

342
00:15:23,200 --> 00:15:27,200
and we made this.

343
00:15:27,300 --> 00:15:30,533
You did?

344
00:15:30,633 --> 00:15:34,733
Some areas could be better.

345
00:15:34,833 --> 00:15:38,533
What I drew was some notes, mouths, and shapes

346
00:15:38,633 --> 00:15:40,400
I thought you loved to take pictures

347
00:15:40,500 --> 00:15:41,833
of strange faces

348
00:15:41,933 --> 00:15:43,233
and some notes.

349
00:15:43,333 --> 00:15:46,233
These are notes and mouths.

350
00:15:46,333 --> 00:15:48,300
Yeah.

351
00:15:48,400 --> 00:15:49,367
You are so sweet.

352
00:15:49,467 --> 00:15:50,800
Keep it, then

353
00:15:50,900 --> 00:15:51,933
I'm not sure if it'll fit you

354
00:15:52,033 --> 00:15:53,167
but do keep it.

355
00:15:53,267 --> 00:15:54,733
That is way too big.

356
00:15:54,833 --> 00:15:56,200
Because his size is quite big.

357
00:15:56,300 --> 00:15:57,400
You know my size?

358
00:15:57,500 --> 00:15:58,233
I don't know your size

359
00:15:58,333 --> 00:16:00,133
but just keep the slippers.

360
00:16:03,167 --> 00:16:04,333
Thank you.

361
00:16:04,433 --> 00:16:06,433
Good night.

362
00:16:06,533 --> 00:16:10,433
(Eri left casually leaves after
giving his present...) Good night.

363
00:16:17,933 --> 00:16:19,833
(Question/Receiving Eri's present?)
Gosh, that is so sweet

364
00:16:19,933 --> 00:16:21,100
I'm really touched.

365
00:16:21,200 --> 00:16:22,800
Eri gifted me a pair

366
00:16:22,900 --> 00:16:25,400
of slippers he made for me.

367
00:16:25,500 --> 00:16:28,833
His design is a Picasso-style face

368
00:16:28,933 --> 00:16:33,133
and there are a bunch of touching words.

369
00:16:34,600 --> 00:16:38,600
Very touching words.

370
00:16:45,500 --> 00:16:47,100
You know, sometimes, it's just...

371
00:16:47,200 --> 00:16:49,133
It feels like.

372
00:16:49,233 --> 00:16:53,867
It's a pity that currently
it's not possible

373
00:16:53,967 --> 00:16:57,367
for me to like him in the same way.

374
00:16:58,200 --> 00:17:00,433
That's how love works, though.

375
00:17:10,400 --> 00:17:12,600
(Double Room/Guan-Yu, NIO)
Gosh, that is adorable.

376
00:17:18,500 --> 00:17:19,733
(NIO is sincerely touched by Eri's gift...)

377
00:17:19,833 --> 00:17:21,267
This is adorable.

378
00:17:24,617 --> 00:17:26,317
Woah, it really is.

379
00:17:28,967 --> 00:17:30,233
I love him so much.

380
00:17:30,333 --> 00:17:31,767
- He really is...
- I really do love him.

381
00:17:31,867 --> 00:17:34,000
He is charming

382
00:17:34,100 --> 00:17:35,733
I love him, too.

383
00:17:45,167 --> 00:17:46,633
I'm exhausted.

384
00:17:46,733 --> 00:17:47,933
Well.

385
00:17:48,367 --> 00:17:49,633
You want to go straight to sleep?

386
00:17:49,733 --> 00:17:50,800
Yeah, I'm a bit tired.

387
00:17:50,900 --> 00:17:52,200
(NIO seems to want to talk
about something to Guan-Yu...)

388
00:17:52,300 --> 00:17:53,800
- I'd like to ask you something.
- Go ahead.

389
00:17:53,900 --> 00:17:56,367
If there is an activity tomorrow

390
00:17:56,467 --> 00:17:59,700
like picking out someone.

391
00:17:59,800 --> 00:18:01,733
No...

392
00:18:01,833 --> 00:18:04,067
No pressure, if you
want to pick someone else

393
00:18:04,167 --> 00:18:07,167
just let me know and
I'll pick another person

394
00:18:07,267 --> 00:18:09,067
because I don't want to

395
00:18:09,167 --> 00:18:10,267
miss a...

396
00:18:10,367 --> 00:18:10,733
Yeah.

397
00:18:10,833 --> 00:18:11,933
Okay.

398
00:18:12,033 --> 00:18:13,000
Yeah.

399
00:18:13,100 --> 00:18:16,033
Well, I don't want to put him

400
00:18:16,133 --> 00:18:18,067
in this position

401
00:18:18,167 --> 00:18:20,300
where he would act in one way

402
00:18:20,400 --> 00:18:21,467
and well, perhaps

403
00:18:21,567 --> 00:18:23,933
act in another way in our room

404
00:18:24,033 --> 00:18:25,667
since the fact

405
00:18:25,767 --> 00:18:29,267
that Gino and he are out in the public

406
00:18:29,367 --> 00:18:31,767
regarding displaying the relationship.

407
00:18:34,533 --> 00:18:36,500
Honestly, if I'm being completely true.

408
00:18:36,600 --> 00:18:38,033
Just be honest with me

409
00:18:38,133 --> 00:18:39,900
I'm not sure if you will...

410
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:42,500
if you'll get offended by me saying this

411
00:18:42,600 --> 00:18:44,967
but I think you're way too good.

412
00:18:45,067 --> 00:18:49,700
Like, I am world's apart from you.

413
00:18:50,300 --> 00:18:51,867
To be fair

414
00:18:51,967 --> 00:18:55,067
we enjoy each other's touches, and

415
00:18:55,167 --> 00:18:56,667
I'm really glad you shared so much with me

416
00:18:56,767 --> 00:18:59,633
but somehow I feel like

417
00:18:59,733 --> 00:19:01,233
you are excellent.

418
00:19:01,333 --> 00:19:03,500
(Guan-Yu is worried about NIO's excellence
and their future...) and you are talented.

419
00:19:03,600 --> 00:19:07,233
Sometimes, it scares me a little

420
00:19:07,333 --> 00:19:09,400
I feel like I don't deserve you in a way.

421
00:19:09,500 --> 00:19:12,633
Like, I would slow you down or

422
00:19:12,733 --> 00:19:15,167
or we wouldn't be great together

423
00:19:15,267 --> 00:19:17,833
in terms of lifestyles, instead of...

424
00:19:17,933 --> 00:19:19,067
Well, yeah

425
00:19:19,400 --> 00:19:21,367
I was a little bit upset

426
00:19:21,467 --> 00:19:23,767
about the fact

427
00:19:23,867 --> 00:19:25,767
that he thought he had nothing
and had no talents.

428
00:19:25,867 --> 00:19:28,367
The fact that he felt that way.

429
00:19:28,833 --> 00:19:30,000
Besides, I have this pressure.

430
00:19:30,100 --> 00:19:32,467
Like, I feel bad for Eri.

431
00:19:32,567 --> 00:19:34,367
You think that...

432
00:19:34,467 --> 00:19:36,567
(They are discussing the
impacts of their relationships...)

433
00:19:36,667 --> 00:19:39,700
I know I'm taking it too far
connecting this to Gino and Eri

434
00:19:39,800 --> 00:19:43,133
and how we view our lifestyles.

435
00:19:43,867 --> 00:19:45,000
It is true

436
00:19:45,100 --> 00:19:47,867
that there is an attraction between us

437
00:19:47,967 --> 00:19:49,933
but I feel like

438
00:19:50,033 --> 00:19:52,600
we won't be great together

439
00:19:52,700 --> 00:19:54,933
I mean.

440
00:19:55,033 --> 00:19:57,733
Our lifestyles differ so much

441
00:19:57,833 --> 00:20:02,633
and anything going on
between me and Guan-Yu

442
00:20:02,733 --> 00:20:05,867
would basically hurt a lot of people.

443
00:20:05,967 --> 00:20:09,433
The reason why all of these are happening

444
00:20:09,533 --> 00:20:14,067
is because when I like someone
I don't reveal it to the public.

445
00:20:14,833 --> 00:20:16,967
Yeah, but the fact that people
don't know about it

446
00:20:17,067 --> 00:20:20,733
cause the issues we're facing now.

447
00:20:22,167 --> 00:20:23,767
Can you understand
what I'm saying better now?

448
00:20:23,867 --> 00:20:26,733
It's not that I have zero interests

449
00:20:26,824 --> 00:20:28,491
- I'm aware.
- I've thought about it

450
00:20:28,600 --> 00:20:30,733
I'm well aware.

451
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:34,733
Good night.

452
00:20:34,833 --> 00:20:38,667
(After this long conversation, Guan-Yu
and NIO reached a consensus...)

453
00:20:43,600 --> 00:20:44,733
It's a lot of pressure

454
00:20:44,833 --> 00:20:46,333
I bet it is.

455
00:20:51,800 --> 00:20:55,533
(However, NIO couldn't fall
asleep throughout the night)

456
00:20:55,633 --> 00:20:56,533
Last night

457
00:20:56,633 --> 00:20:58,900
I only slept for two hours.

458
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:00,967
It's normal to experience
this disappointment

459
00:21:01,067 --> 00:21:03,267
but we smoothed everything out in the open.

460
00:21:03,733 --> 00:21:05,367
To put it more correctly

461
00:21:05,467 --> 00:21:07,967
it's like letting go of something.

462
00:21:08,067 --> 00:21:12,333
(NIO didn't get sleep last
night, trying to let go of Guan-Yu)

463
00:21:20,867 --> 00:21:23,700
(DAY 5)

464
00:21:24,076 --> 00:21:28,076
(Double Room/Susu, Jia-Hang)

465
00:21:33,800 --> 00:21:35,233
I don't wanna wake up.

466
00:21:37,533 --> 00:21:39,067
Well

467
00:21:39,167 --> 00:21:41,733
this journey is about to be over.

468
00:21:43,333 --> 00:21:45,333
Let's walk the last mile

469
00:21:45,433 --> 00:21:47,000
of our journey together.

470
00:21:48,567 --> 00:21:49,633
Don't you think my eyes.

471
00:21:49,733 --> 00:21:51,100
(Double Room/Eri, Bobo)
look worse with more concealer?

472
00:21:53,933 --> 00:21:56,167
(Double Room/Shih-Feng, Gino)

473
00:21:56,800 --> 00:21:58,033
(dressing carefully)

474
00:22:02,233 --> 00:22:04,933
Gino.

475
00:22:05,033 --> 00:22:07,167
Which one is better?

476
00:22:07,267 --> 00:22:08,333
Your right side.

477
00:22:08,433 --> 00:22:09,233
- This side?
- Umm.

478
00:22:09,333 --> 00:22:10,267
Okay.

479
00:22:10,367 --> 00:22:12,667
(Every person is getting
fully ready for today...)

480
00:22:14,100 --> 00:22:15,633
(Double Room/Guan-Yu, NIO) It's
quite funny that I cried so much yesterday.

481
00:22:15,733 --> 00:22:18,333
My eyes do not look the same.

482
00:22:18,433 --> 00:22:20,067
Turning into slanted eyes.

483
00:22:20,167 --> 00:22:22,167
(Guan-Yu cried too much last
night and his eyes are swollen...)

484
00:22:22,267 --> 00:22:23,967
Just like Gino's.

485
00:22:24,400 --> 00:22:25,800
Oh my gosh, crying like a baby.

486
00:22:25,900 --> 00:22:28,500
Your eyes really look slanted.

487
00:22:37,533 --> 00:22:40,167
(Everyone gathers
together for the breakfast)

488
00:22:41,467 --> 00:22:43,567
- We have that over here.
- How cute

489
00:22:43,667 --> 00:22:45,833
(staring at each other)
They got everything ready.

490
00:22:45,933 --> 00:22:46,833
Do you want it?

491
00:22:46,933 --> 00:22:49,000
- I'd like that, thanks.
- Alright.

492
00:22:49,100 --> 00:22:50,100
Soy milk.

493
00:22:50,200 --> 00:22:50,900
Yeah.

494
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:51,800
Woah.

495
00:22:53,300 --> 00:22:56,233
My English is currently
at the elementary level

496
00:22:56,600 --> 00:22:57,967
I mean, in the middle of the night

497
00:22:58,067 --> 00:22:59,467
did you guys cry?

498
00:22:59,567 --> 00:23:00,533
Cry?

499
00:23:00,633 --> 00:23:03,100
Because your eyes look more swollen
than the ones yesterday.

500
00:23:03,200 --> 00:23:04,833
(Each of them who cried last
night has swollen eyes...) Seriously?

501
00:23:05,333 --> 00:23:07,200
His eyes look slanted.

502
00:23:07,300 --> 00:23:09,000
He looks like Gino this morning.

503
00:23:09,467 --> 00:23:10,967
Turning like this.

504
00:23:12,251 --> 00:23:13,984
Nah... yesterday

505
00:23:14,100 --> 00:23:15,367
I did cry for quite some time yesterday.

506
00:23:15,467 --> 00:23:18,100
They got less swollen when I woke up.

507
00:23:20,667 --> 00:23:22,300
In the blink of an eye, it's Friday.

508
00:23:22,967 --> 00:23:23,867
It's Friday already.

509
00:23:23,967 --> 00:23:24,467
(Tomorrow is the last day of this journey)
Yeah.

510
00:23:24,567 --> 00:23:26,867
- It's Friday.
- Tomorrow is our last day

511
00:23:26,967 --> 00:23:28,700
(here comes the chime)
It's about time that we...

512
00:23:28,800 --> 00:23:29,600
Is it ours?

513
00:23:29,700 --> 00:23:31,133
Ding-dong.

514
00:23:40,933 --> 00:23:43,100
I'm good at this.

515
00:23:44,833 --> 00:23:46,500
We're not splitting up.

516
00:23:46,600 --> 00:23:47,337
Camping.

517
00:23:47,362 --> 00:23:48,733
(Please pack your bags, and get ready
to move to the next sleepover destination)

518
00:23:48,824 --> 00:23:50,424
He's embarking on
many new adventures in life.

519
00:23:50,533 --> 00:23:52,367
- Since that's something you usually won't do.
- In a fun way.

520
00:23:52,490 --> 00:23:54,956
- The breakfast box today is a hint.
- I don't wanna sleep on the floor.

521
00:23:55,033 --> 00:23:56,167
Bad sleep.

522
00:23:56,267 --> 00:23:57,667
Did someone camp before?

523
00:23:57,767 --> 00:23:58,800
Me.

524
00:23:59,667 --> 00:24:00,933
Me either

525
00:24:01,033 --> 00:24:03,233
I've almost finished my packing, anyway

526
00:24:03,333 --> 00:24:04,800
and you haven't.

527
00:24:04,900 --> 00:24:05,767
Be quiet.

528
00:24:05,867 --> 00:24:07,900
You broke my suitcase.

529
00:24:09,500 --> 00:24:10,467
Alright, I'm sorry.

530
00:24:10,567 --> 00:24:11,667
What exactly did you guys do in your room

531
00:24:11,767 --> 00:24:12,933
so that the suitcase was broken?

532
00:24:13,033 --> 00:24:13,900
A secret.

533
00:24:14,600 --> 00:24:15,967
Please watch the VCR.

534
00:24:17,333 --> 00:24:19,300
I thought you were boring.

535
00:24:20,833 --> 00:24:21,833
You didn't come across as someone...

536
00:24:21,933 --> 00:24:23,567
And you're being humorous now.

537
00:24:24,600 --> 00:24:30,533
(What would happen to these happy guys
as they reach the end of their journey?)

(Double Room/Susu, Jia-Hang)

539
00:24:42,700 --> 00:24:43,667
When we go on camping

540
00:24:43,767 --> 00:24:45,133
do we have to bring that...

541
00:24:45,233 --> 00:24:46,467
Love?

542
00:24:49,700 --> 00:24:50,567
Nevermind

543
00:24:50,658 --> 00:24:52,033
Hit me with that unexpected.

544
00:24:52,133 --> 00:24:53,833
Look at you.

545
00:24:53,933 --> 00:24:55,600
(After a night of reflection, Jia-Hang seems
more relaxed) That plot twist of yours.

546
00:24:55,700 --> 00:24:56,967
Aren't we here looking for love?

547
00:24:57,067 --> 00:24:59,467
Yeah, right, you're right.

548
00:24:59,767 --> 00:25:00,767
(Double Room/Eri, Bobo)
So now would you insist

549
00:25:00,867 --> 00:25:01,933
choosing NIO at the end?

550
00:25:02,033 --> 00:25:03,600
I will definitely choose him.

551
00:25:04,300 --> 00:25:09,367
This has nothing to do
with any of my feelings.

552
00:25:09,833 --> 00:25:11,367
Then should I pick him?

553
00:25:11,467 --> 00:25:13,800
If you want to, then of course.

554
00:25:13,900 --> 00:25:16,233
As long as you know what you're doing.

555
00:25:16,333 --> 00:25:18,167
That seems about right.

(Gino helps Guan-Yu
pack his suitcase and...)

558
00:25:23,467 --> 00:25:24,133
What's wrong?

559
00:25:24,233 --> 00:25:25,500
Nothing.

560
00:25:26,133 --> 00:25:27,367
Just here for my hugs?

561
00:25:27,467 --> 00:25:28,833
Yeah.

562
00:25:29,967 --> 00:25:31,033
Well

563
00:25:31,133 --> 00:25:33,333

(Double Room/Shih-Feng, Gino)

565

You guys have tons of things.

566
00:25:45,800 --> 00:25:47,000
Yeah

567
00:25:47,100 --> 00:25:50,300
I bet you would miss it here.

568
00:25:50,400 --> 00:25:51,767
It's beautiful here.

569
00:25:51,867 --> 00:25:53,333
This place is amazing.

570
00:25:54,267 --> 00:25:56,867
I'm glad I am here with you guys.

(With bags full and memories in tow...
ready to check out from the cabin!)

572
00:26:17,733 --> 00:26:20,167
I think me and NIO have reached a consensus

573
00:26:20,267 --> 00:26:22,367
and we remain to be friends.

574
00:26:22,467 --> 00:26:23,800
It's nice this way.

575

at this romantic camping site...)

Please pick the tent you wanna live in.

There will be itineraries in the tents

that you can exchange.

Exchange?

Who wants to join me?

00:28:15,100 --> 00:28:16,567
- Can I pair with you?
- Sure.

- Let's go.
- Excellent

590

It's the air-conditioner.

Yeah, the air is cool.

- Yeah, let's go.

It is my honor.

646
00:29:59,267 --> 00:30:00,567
Let's take a look at the mission cards

647

and decide if we like it or not.

648

Let's go make jam and let's be farmers.

00:30:12,167 --> 00:30:14,900
Well, let's discuss the card with them.

651
00:30:15,000 --> 00:30:16,600
See if they want to switch.

652
00:30:16,700 --> 00:30:18,667
- Can I switch?
- If someone dislikes their mission.

653
00:30:18,767 --> 00:30:20,133
What's yours?

654
00:30:20,233 --> 00:30:21,300
You go first.

655
00:30:22,533 --> 00:30:23,667
(New roommates gather together to switch their cards...)
Alright, we have one.

656
00:30:23,767 --> 00:30:25,067
"Let's be a farmer."

657
00:30:25,167 --> 00:30:27,167
Another one is "Let's go make jam".

658
00:30:27,267 --> 00:30:29,633
Actually, I like both of them

659
00:30:29,720 --> 00:30:31,100
I can switch the fruit-picking with you

660
00:30:31,200 --> 00:30:32,433
I kind of like making jams.

661
00:30:32,533 --> 00:30:34,800
Well, the fruits.

662
00:30:34,900 --> 00:30:36,267
At first, I had the card.

663
00:30:36,367 --> 00:30:38,567
"Let's be a farmer."

664
00:30:38,667 --> 00:30:41,867
Being out in the sun is not my thing

665
00:30:41,967 --> 00:30:44,267
or any outdoor activities, yeah.

666
00:30:44,367 --> 00:30:45,867
Do you want to be a farmer?

667
00:30:45,967 --> 00:30:48,467
Or let's go be a farmer together.

668
00:30:49,600 --> 00:30:50,033
Wanna switch?

669
00:30:50,133 --> 00:30:51,600
(Eri and Jia-Hang switched their schedules)
- Alright - Okay.

670
00:30:51,700 --> 00:30:52,167
Are you sure?

671
00:30:52,267 --> 00:30:53,433
I am fine with it.

672
00:30:53,533 --> 00:30:54,667
Do you wanna switch with me?

673
00:30:54,767 --> 00:30:56,000
Do what you enjoy doing

674
00:30:56,100 --> 00:30:57,967
I want to stay indoors.

675
00:30:58,067 --> 00:30:59,767
Then let's all stay indoors.

676
00:30:59,867 --> 00:31:02,267
Swap the cards again.

677
00:31:02,367 --> 00:31:04,200
Do what you enjoy doing

678
00:31:04,300 --> 00:31:05,667
or go with the person you want.

679
00:31:05,767 --> 00:31:07,500
Yeah, pick one

680
00:31:07,600 --> 00:31:09,667
- I'm so nervous. What's yours?
- Mine is...

681
00:31:09,767 --> 00:31:10,767
We have four on the jam group.

682
00:31:10,867 --> 00:31:11,800
Yeah, four for jam-making

683
00:31:11,900 --> 00:31:15,500
I've realized NIO and I get along quite well

684
00:31:15,600 --> 00:31:16,367
I'm not sure

685
00:31:16,467 --> 00:31:18,633
if it is attributed to his social personality

686
00:31:18,733 --> 00:31:20,800
but I think it's fun talking to him.

687
00:31:20,900 --> 00:31:22,067
On top of that

688
00:31:22,167 --> 00:31:23,633
like I said, I adore a doggie face.

689
00:31:23,733 --> 00:31:26,000
He looks exactly like a doggie.

690
00:31:26,100 --> 00:31:27,733
This is something I didn't notice

691
00:31:27,833 --> 00:31:29,267
for the last two days.

692
00:31:29,367 --> 00:31:30,600
Yeah, four people on the jam mission.

693
00:31:30,700 --> 00:31:32,133
Do you wanna switch with me?

694
00:31:32,233 --> 00:31:32,800
Switching with you?

695
00:31:32,900 --> 00:31:34,567
Do you wanna go fruit-picking?

696
00:31:34,667 --> 00:31:36,267
His expressions...

697
00:31:36,367 --> 00:31:38,233
(Jia-Hang and Susu successfully swapped the cards)
- He wants to stay clear of the sun, right? - Swap with me.

698
00:31:38,333 --> 00:31:40,100
He wants to be indoors.

699
00:31:40,200 --> 00:31:42,000
Alright...

700
00:31:42,084 --> 00:31:44,651
(Gino and Susu go on a fruit-picking date)
Susu and I are fruit-picking.

701
00:31:44,767 --> 00:31:46,233
Let's go pick some fruits.

702
00:31:46,333 --> 00:31:49,600
(Bobo and Eri go on a farm date together)
Me and Eri would be happy farmers.

703
00:31:49,700 --> 00:31:52,667
(Jia-Hang, NIO, Shih-Feng, and
Guan-Yu go on a jam-making date)

704
00:31:52,767 --> 00:31:54,167
There are four of us.

705
00:31:54,667 --> 00:31:58,300
(Returning to the tents for
rest before setting out on dates)

706
00:31:58,967 --> 00:32:01,467
(Double Tent/Gino, Guan-Yu)

707
00:32:01,733 --> 00:32:02,600
It feels good staying here.

708
00:32:02,700 --> 00:32:04,033
Yeah

709
00:32:04,133 --> 00:32:05,833
I'm gonna take a rest.

710
00:32:05,933 --> 00:32:06,567
Let me help.

711
00:32:06,667 --> 00:32:07,767
Sure

712
00:32:07,867 --> 00:32:10,833
I think it'll take a while for me to adapt

713
00:32:10,933 --> 00:32:13,433
the life after I leave the show.

714
00:32:13,533 --> 00:32:14,867
Why? How long will that be?

715
00:32:14,967 --> 00:32:16,533
How long do you think it'll take?

716
00:32:17,200 --> 00:32:18,933
- Because I...
- Probably a week

717
00:32:19,033 --> 00:32:19,567
I guess so

718
00:32:19,667 --> 00:32:21,867
I'm used to having you guys around.

719
00:32:22,467 --> 00:32:23,567
It happened quite naturally.

720
00:32:23,667 --> 00:32:25,367
(Question/Why'd you pick Guan-Yu as your tent mate?)

721
00:32:25,467 --> 00:32:26,567
because we went to the hot
spring yesterday for the whole day.

722
00:32:26,667 --> 00:32:29,033
Yeah, I guess a sense of connection.

723
00:32:29,133 --> 00:32:30,633
We just got paired up together naturally.

724
00:32:30,733 --> 00:32:31,900
Plus, other people

725
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:34,633
didn't particularly ask us.

726
00:32:34,733 --> 00:32:36,633
So, we have our own tent it is.

727
00:32:39,367 --> 00:32:40,733
I think in a way, people have already

728
00:32:40,833 --> 00:32:42,433
considered us both like

729
00:32:42,533 --> 00:32:44,067
we are a couple.

730
00:32:44,167 --> 00:32:45,933
Shih-Feng would even joke about it

731
00:32:46,567 --> 00:32:47,967
saying, "Alright... just let them to be"

732
00:32:48,067 --> 00:32:49,267
or something like

733
00:32:49,367 --> 00:32:51,200
"they look better in front of the camera."

734
00:32:52,200 --> 00:32:54,500
Why would you pick me?

735
00:32:54,600 --> 00:32:56,600
Because you look cute.

736
00:32:56,700 --> 00:32:58,767
(Guan-Yu wants to check if
Gino really means it) That's all?

737
00:32:58,867 --> 00:32:59,533
Yeah.

738
00:32:59,633 --> 00:33:02,700
- You're in the good-looks club.
- I'm old.

739
00:33:02,800 --> 00:33:03,533
I'm kidding.

740
00:33:03,633 --> 00:33:05,167
- So you just think.
- Well, in my opinion

741
00:33:05,267 --> 00:33:06,867
you have an amazing aura

742
00:33:06,967 --> 00:33:09,633
all around you.

743
00:33:09,767 --> 00:33:10,833
Same, I want to get to know.

744
00:33:10,933 --> 00:33:12,967
Gino better, because his profession

745
00:33:13,067 --> 00:33:14,600
makes me wonder the way he treats me

746
00:33:14,700 --> 00:33:18,333
whether it is his working
mode or he takes me seriously.

747
00:33:18,967 --> 00:33:21,513
(Gino's influencer status causes
confusion and unease for Guan-Yu)

748
00:33:21,538 --> 00:33:25,333
I feel like, if I am able to
give you some suggestions.

749
00:33:25,900 --> 00:33:27,633
I think it might...

750
00:33:27,733 --> 00:33:28,567
Oh, yeah

751
00:33:28,667 --> 00:33:29,467
quite nice.

752
00:33:29,567 --> 00:33:31,800
Thank you for choosing me.

753
00:33:33,433 --> 00:33:33,733
(Double Tent/Eri, Jia-Hang)

754
00:33:33,833 --> 00:33:36,133
Have you ever lived in a tent before?

755
00:33:36,233 --> 00:33:38,100
Only once when I served in the military.

756
00:33:38,200 --> 00:33:41,300
- The one for outdoor survival?
- Yeah.

757
00:33:43,233 --> 00:33:46,200
Were you scared
that no one will would sleep with you?

758
00:33:46,300 --> 00:33:50,133
(Observant Art noticed Jia-Hang's
anxiety...) A little, I panicked a little

759
00:33:50,233 --> 00:33:52,033
I didn't know whom I should pick

760
00:33:52,133 --> 00:33:54,700
but I didn't want to share a tent with NIO.

761
00:33:54,800 --> 00:33:56,000
Yeah.

762
00:33:56,100 --> 00:33:57,400
At that moment, I saw Jia-Hang

763
00:33:57,500 --> 00:33:59,667
kind of feeling helpless

764
00:33:59,767 --> 00:34:02,600
I figured probably no one would pick him

765
00:34:02,700 --> 00:34:04,400
or something like that.

766
00:34:04,500 --> 00:34:05,733
When my gaze fell on him

767
00:34:05,833 --> 00:34:07,967
I decided to share a tent with him.

768
00:34:10,333 --> 00:34:12,500
Honestly, I wanted to pick NIO

769
00:34:12,600 --> 00:34:14,400
but Eri invited me.

770
00:34:14,500 --> 00:34:16,033
(Question/Whom did you want
to share a tent with?) so I figured...

771
00:34:16,800 --> 00:34:19,067
Well, I've been hearing rumors

772
00:34:19,167 --> 00:34:20,633
that Eri likes NIO

773
00:34:20,733 --> 00:34:23,633
so I guess it's also a way

774
00:34:23,733 --> 00:34:26,533
to better understand my enemy.

775
00:34:28,175 --> 00:34:29,475
I think he and Bobo

776
00:34:29,500 --> 00:34:31,333
share some similar characteristics

777
00:34:31,433 --> 00:34:33,233
but it takes a little longer

778
00:34:33,333 --> 00:34:36,867
for him than for Bobo to get
acquainted with someone.

779
00:34:41,667 --> 00:34:42,200
(Double Tent/Bobo, NIO)

780
00:34:42,300 --> 00:34:43,033
Any bed habits are cool

781
00:34:43,133 --> 00:34:44,400
so go ahead if you wanna lie down

782
00:34:44,500 --> 00:34:45,900
I won't mind.

783
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:46,800
It's alright

784
00:34:46,900 --> 00:34:48,500
I wanna sit right here.

785
00:34:49,200 --> 00:34:50,700
This chair seems very comfy

786
00:34:50,800 --> 00:34:53,133
but the camera is right here.

787
00:34:54,100 --> 00:34:56,033
The small ones would bite people.

788
00:34:56,133 --> 00:34:56,967
Yeah.

789
00:34:57,067 --> 00:34:58,733
The small ones are the scariest.

790
00:34:58,833 --> 00:35:00,200
(Bobo and NIO are still talking about mosquitoes...)
So I see, I thought they were.

791
00:35:00,307 --> 00:35:02,107
The bite will get itchy and uncomfortable

792
00:35:02,200 --> 00:35:03,867
I thought they wouldn't bite.

793
00:35:03,967 --> 00:35:05,500
Nah, they are the crazy ones. Look

794
00:35:05,767 --> 00:35:09,115
I've thought about Eri and Shih-Feng.

795
00:35:09,140 --> 00:35:11,033
(Question/Why didn't you pick Eri?)
If I were him

796
00:35:11,125 --> 00:35:13,592
I would want some space

797
00:35:13,700 --> 00:35:15,667
so I didn't want to force Eri

798
00:35:15,767 --> 00:35:18,033
to keep hanging out with me all the time.

799
00:35:18,367 --> 00:35:20,333
Welcome in.

800
00:35:20,433 --> 00:35:21,896
Welcome to our tent.

801
00:35:21,921 --> 00:35:23,192
(Eri visits Bobo and NIO)
Come in.

802
00:35:23,217 --> 00:35:24,267
Can you sing "Love Me, Don't Go"

803
00:35:24,367 --> 00:35:26,700
- I can.
- Shut it.

804
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:29,267
Out of tune.

805
00:35:30,167 --> 00:35:31,600
- Over here.
- So?

806
00:35:31,700 --> 00:35:33,600
(Mosquito Specialist)
Nice.

807
00:35:33,700 --> 00:35:34,833
There's one bug over here.

808
00:35:34,933 --> 00:35:38,467
Well, he kept catching mosquitoes for me.

809
00:35:38,567 --> 00:35:39,967
(Question/Thoughts on the new roommate?)
asking me if I needed any water.

810
00:35:40,067 --> 00:35:41,067
He'd get me water

811
00:35:41,167 --> 00:35:43,400
I was a little surprised.

812
00:35:43,500 --> 00:35:45,367
Yeah, since we weren't that close.

813
00:35:45,467 --> 00:35:46,833
We didn't talk that much.

814
00:35:46,933 --> 00:35:48,200
Starting from today

815
00:35:48,300 --> 00:35:50,733
perhaps starting from yesterday

816
00:35:50,833 --> 00:35:52,433
he've opened up more

817
00:35:52,533 --> 00:35:54,033
being himself more.

818
00:35:54,133 --> 00:35:56,300
That's why I want to get closer to him

819
00:35:56,400 --> 00:35:58,167
and chat with him, yeah.

820
00:35:58,267 --> 00:36:01,167
(Last night at the dinner table)
Because everyone is so real

821
00:36:01,267 --> 00:36:02,800
so I have nowhere to hide

822
00:36:02,900 --> 00:36:05,133
and can only force myself to reveal

823
00:36:05,233 --> 00:36:07,000
the true me.

824
00:36:07,100 --> 00:36:09,733
(Bobo opens himself more and more after
couple of days...) which leads to this

825
00:36:09,833 --> 00:36:11,267
terrible scene today

826
00:36:11,367 --> 00:36:13,633
- I think this...
- It is not a terrible scene.

827
00:36:13,733 --> 00:36:15,160
(Question/Thoughts on the new
roommate NIO?) A total stranger.

828
00:36:15,185 --> 00:36:17,700
He confessed to me yesterday
that he thought I was some boring person.

829
00:36:17,800 --> 00:36:19,833
He called me Bobo-boring.

830
00:36:19,933 --> 00:36:21,800
On the first day

831
00:36:21,900 --> 00:36:24,767
I originally described
you as a boring person

832
00:36:24,867 --> 00:36:26,533
for the reason that you

833
00:36:26,633 --> 00:36:28,033
kept your mouth shut

834
00:36:28,133 --> 00:36:29,600
and you kept everything inside.

835
00:36:29,700 --> 00:36:31,615
(NIO confessed his first
impression of Bobo was boring, but...)

836
00:36:31,640 --> 00:36:34,424
Now you are starting to open up more.
Apart from that, what I'm seeing now

837
00:36:34,533 --> 00:36:36,100
you may think it looks ugly

838
00:36:36,200 --> 00:36:38,700
but I would love to know this side of you.

839
00:36:38,800 --> 00:36:40,367
That's right

840
00:36:40,467 --> 00:36:44,333
I'm more... intrigued by this new you

841
00:36:44,433 --> 00:36:46,267
I just want my roommate not to hit me

842
00:36:46,367 --> 00:36:48,467
when he hears my snore.

843
00:36:49,367 --> 00:36:50,733
That's all.

844
00:36:52,767 --> 00:36:54,533
Can I not take off my shoes?

845
00:36:55,133 --> 00:36:56,233
- Sure.
- Not after I get in here.

846
00:36:56,333 --> 00:36:58,067
Yeah, let's take the shoes off inside.

847
00:36:59,400 --> 00:37:02,100
We wandered around the Lavender Forest.

848
00:37:02,200 --> 00:37:04,500
Surprisingly, Susu and I talked a lot

849
00:37:04,600 --> 00:37:06,933
and overall the conversation has gone

850
00:37:07,033 --> 00:37:08,233
quite well.

851
00:37:08,333 --> 00:37:11,500
It would be nice to get to know him better.

852
00:37:12,367 --> 00:37:14,267
(Double Tent/Shih-Feng, Susu)
Did you have someone in your mind

853
00:37:14,367 --> 00:37:15,400
and then I chose you?

854
00:37:15,500 --> 00:37:16,400
- Me?
- Yeah.

855
00:37:16,500 --> 00:37:17,067
What do you mean?

856
00:37:17,167 --> 00:37:19,033
When you picked your roommate.

857
00:37:19,133 --> 00:37:20,433
Nah, I was thinking

858
00:37:20,533 --> 00:37:21,633
that if I couldn't pick the same one

859
00:37:21,733 --> 00:37:22,767
then I was cool with either one.

860
00:37:22,867 --> 00:37:24,433
Great. I'm glad to hear it

861
00:37:24,533 --> 00:37:26,433
I kind of wanted to live with Eri.

862
00:37:26,533 --> 00:37:28,967
(Originally, Susu wanted Eri to be
his roommate) but it was fine, though.

863
00:37:29,067 --> 00:37:30,400
Normally I don't insist on things.

864
00:37:30,500 --> 00:37:31,867
Understood.

865
00:37:31,967 --> 00:37:33,367
Well, I wanted everyone

866
00:37:33,467 --> 00:37:35,767
to stay in the same tent together tonight.

867
00:37:35,867 --> 00:37:37,833
Well, to have that opportunity

868
00:37:37,933 --> 00:37:39,333
to chat more about stuff.

869
00:37:39,433 --> 00:37:40,800
After all, it is the last night

870
00:37:40,900 --> 00:37:43,200
I still hope I get to

871
00:37:43,300 --> 00:37:44,533
have more conversations with everyone.

872
00:37:45,033 --> 00:37:46,233
Go

873
00:37:46,333 --> 00:37:47,300
I'll get back to you later.

874
00:37:47,400 --> 00:37:48,533
Alright

875
00:37:48,633 --> 00:37:49,433
I mean, I bet tonight we will...

876
00:37:49,533 --> 00:37:50,433
I bet we will.

877
00:37:50,533 --> 00:37:52,633
All of us would be
staying up late chatting.

878
00:37:52,733 --> 00:37:53,933
You mean everyone?

879
00:37:54,333 --> 00:37:54,967
Yeah.

880
00:37:55,067 --> 00:37:56,867
Don't you think tonight we will all

881
00:37:56,967 --> 00:37:58,167
get together for a nice chat?

882
00:37:58,267 --> 00:37:59,000
You're not up for it?

883
00:37:59,100 --> 00:38:00,300
I kind of want to talk with you.

884
00:38:00,400 --> 00:38:01,733
You mean alone?

885
00:38:01,833 --> 00:38:02,533
If the chance comes up.

886
00:38:02,633 --> 00:38:04,333
It's cool if you wanna talk with everyone

887
00:38:04,433 --> 00:38:07,000
I mean, I guess that
depends on the situation.

888
00:38:07,100 --> 00:38:08,767
No problem. No problem at all.

889
00:38:11,733 --> 00:38:13,933
(The jam-making group
proceeds to the kitchen)

890
00:38:14,033 --> 00:38:15,133
What kind of jam is this?

891
00:38:15,233 --> 00:38:16,033
Orange?

892
00:38:16,133 --> 00:38:17,300
It says orange...

893
00:38:17,400 --> 00:38:18,967
Farmhouse.

894
00:38:19,933 --> 00:38:22,033
The guava jam is quite special

895
00:38:22,133 --> 00:38:23,700
I don't know what that is.

896
00:38:28,133 --> 00:38:30,100
So cool.

897
00:38:30,567 --> 00:38:33,500
Alright, we're making waxberry jam.

898
00:38:33,600 --> 00:38:35,533
Red ones on the table are waxberries.

899
00:38:35,633 --> 00:38:36,600
- Waxberries.
- Yeah.

900
00:38:36,700 --> 00:38:37,633
For these waxberries

901
00:38:37,733 --> 00:38:39,600
we planted them at our campsite over here.

902
00:38:39,700 --> 00:38:41,867
Yeah, just let the berries dry and soak up.

903
00:38:41,967 --> 00:38:43,700
Next, put the jam into the jar.

904
00:38:43,800 --> 00:38:45,100
- Yeah.
- Okay.

905
00:38:45,200 --> 00:38:45,833
(Guan-Yu and Jia-Hang form a group)
I wanna...

906
00:38:45,933 --> 00:38:47,067
Do you wanna pour it?

907
00:38:47,167 --> 00:38:48,033
Go ahead... don't be scared.

908
00:38:48,133 --> 00:38:49,600
Simply pour the sugar in.

909
00:38:50,667 --> 00:38:52,867
- Well, that's it.
- Yeah, simply pouring it in.

910
00:38:53,400 --> 00:38:54,333
Aren't you down?

911
00:38:54,433 --> 00:38:55,167
Let me take some pictures

912
00:38:55,267 --> 00:38:57,333
- I thought you were asking the teacher.
- And I'll be down.

913
00:38:58,133 --> 00:38:59,167
No way.

914
00:38:59,267 --> 00:39:01,867
- Teacher, aren't you down?
- I bet she is tired of making jams.

915
00:39:03,467 --> 00:39:04,267
Let the water dry

916
00:39:04,367 --> 00:39:05,400
and the jam will get dense.

917
00:39:05,500 --> 00:39:07,300
The cameral smells incredible.

918
00:39:07,400 --> 00:39:08,367
Do you wanna try it?

919
00:39:08,467 --> 00:39:10,367
Oh, sure.

920
00:39:10,467 --> 00:39:12,067
Don't be scared. Just give it a stir

921
00:39:12,167 --> 00:39:13,900
and don't let it,

922
00:39:14,000 --> 00:39:15,900
let it get heated evenly.

923
00:39:21,233 --> 00:39:22,300
Then do you think

924
00:39:22,400 --> 00:39:24,067
it is romantic to cook together?

925
00:39:24,167 --> 00:39:24,767
It is.

926
00:39:24,867 --> 00:39:25,667
No kidding.

927
00:39:25,767 --> 00:39:26,567
It is romantic.

928
00:39:26,667 --> 00:39:28,033
Or do you feel tired about it?

929
00:39:28,133 --> 00:39:31,200
Like, I'm gonna sit
in the living room and watch TV.

930
00:39:31,300 --> 00:39:32,533
That works, too.

931
00:39:33,633 --> 00:39:35,333
Ever received love letters before?

932
00:39:35,433 --> 00:39:35,933
Yeah.

933
00:39:36,033 --> 00:39:37,367
Seriously?

934
00:39:37,933 --> 00:39:39,467
I always keep them.

935
00:39:39,567 --> 00:39:41,600
- How about now.
- You wrote love letters?

936
00:39:41,700 --> 00:39:42,733
I've written one and received it before.

937
00:39:42,833 --> 00:39:43,833
Gosh.

938
00:39:43,933 --> 00:39:45,600
Or how did you guys confess love?

939
00:39:46,333 --> 00:39:48,467
There is no such thing as a confession

940
00:39:48,567 --> 00:39:49,667
in my opinion

941
00:39:49,767 --> 00:39:51,533
- I've never done that specifically.
- Oh, really?

942
00:39:51,633 --> 00:39:52,667
It just comes naturally?

943
00:39:52,767 --> 00:39:54,567
Yeah, it slowly happens.

944
00:39:54,667 --> 00:39:57,167
We will just grow closer
and closer together.

945
00:39:57,267 --> 00:39:58,300
(New dating groups create new
conversations) So you won't necessarily

946
00:39:58,400 --> 00:40:00,233
experience love at first sight.

947
00:40:00,333 --> 00:40:01,167
It's not easy for me.

948
00:40:01,267 --> 00:40:02,067
Even if you have feelings

949
00:40:02,167 --> 00:40:02,833
you guys won't necessarily be together.

950
00:40:02,933 --> 00:40:04,300
- True.
- Got it

951
00:40:04,400 --> 00:40:06,267
I just stood beside NIO silently

952
00:40:06,367 --> 00:40:08,367
observing every detail of his move

953
00:40:08,467 --> 00:40:10,533
trying to poke around a little.

954
00:40:10,633 --> 00:40:12,033
For example, he mentioned

955
00:40:12,133 --> 00:40:14,533
that he's not into love at first sight

956
00:40:14,624 --> 00:40:16,491
and he loves longer relationship bonding

957
00:40:16,600 --> 00:40:18,267
around two to three months.

958
00:40:18,367 --> 00:40:19,867
And I made a mental note

959
00:40:19,967 --> 00:40:22,300
of his information

960
00:40:22,400 --> 00:40:25,700
plus his boring lame jokes

961
00:40:25,800 --> 00:40:27,367
I've added extra ingredients.

962
00:40:27,467 --> 00:40:28,833
My sweat

963
00:40:28,933 --> 00:40:31,033
(speechless) - (Instructor off screen:)
That must add some special taste to it.

964
00:40:31,667 --> 00:40:33,633
The teacher knows what to say.

965
00:40:35,000 --> 00:40:35,933
Thank you.

966
00:40:36,700 --> 00:40:38,467
- You good?
- Yeah.

967
00:40:39,700 --> 00:40:42,167
Thanks, and you might need some of that, too.

968
00:40:43,300 --> 00:40:45,200
I think Shih-Feng has been looking after me

969
00:40:45,300 --> 00:40:48,833
and I'm trying to look after him more.

970
00:40:48,933 --> 00:40:50,300
(NIO helps him swipe off sweat)

971
00:40:50,400 --> 00:40:52,667
I have a great deal of feelings toward NIO.

972
00:40:52,767 --> 00:40:55,200
From what I'm able to do,

973
00:40:55,300 --> 00:40:58,167
I'll try my best to maintain

974
00:40:58,267 --> 00:41:01,433
this current friendly
relationship with him.

975
00:41:01,533 --> 00:41:03,633
- Are you alright? You're sweating.
- Yeah.

976
00:41:03,748 --> 00:41:05,415
The heat usually gets to me.

977
00:41:06,400 --> 00:41:07,900
I just sweat a lot

978
00:41:07,971 --> 00:41:09,467
I think you're gonna fail.

979
00:41:09,567 --> 00:41:11,200
Thanks for your consideration.

980
00:41:11,633 --> 00:41:12,767
You know, I just think.

981
00:41:12,867 --> 00:41:15,200
He is worried it'll turn into juice.

982
00:41:15,300 --> 00:41:17,200
Similar to falling in
love, we aren't in a hurry.

983
00:41:17,300 --> 00:41:19,167
- Falling in love.
- Yeah.

984
00:41:19,267 --> 00:41:20,300
Love might not work out now

985
00:41:20,400 --> 00:41:24,267
but it'll come
looking for you later.

986
00:41:24,367 --> 00:41:26,400
It's terrifying.

987
00:41:28,120 --> 00:41:29,471
I think we have to try a little harder.

988
00:41:29,496 --> 00:41:32,198
(Amidst the laughter, as the jam takes
shape... could love follow course?)

989
00:41:36,733 --> 00:41:37,733
They both have their own opinions

990
00:41:37,833 --> 00:41:39,900
and they just love to keep on talking.

991
00:41:40,000 --> 00:41:41,367
Plus, I love watching Shih-Feng

992
00:41:41,467 --> 00:41:43,833
I mean the way he expresses his emotions.

993
00:41:43,933 --> 00:41:45,400
They are hilarious

994
00:41:45,500 --> 00:41:48,233
It's fun hanging out with them.

995
00:41:49,967 --> 00:41:51,933
I wish ours was ready now.

996
00:41:52,033 --> 00:41:53,167
It's hot.

997
00:41:54,300 --> 00:41:57,867
You often jump from

998
00:41:57,967 --> 00:42:00,333
an emotion of enjoying one process

999
00:42:00,433 --> 00:42:03,500
to a place where you want to get this over with.

1000
00:42:03,600 --> 00:42:06,167
It's about time. My life is about time.

1001
00:42:07,433 --> 00:42:09,200
Pretending to work my ass off.

1002
00:42:09,900 --> 00:42:10,700
We are done here.

1003
00:42:10,800 --> 00:42:11,667
- For real?
- Yeah.

1004
00:42:11,767 --> 00:42:12,733
It's time to turn off the stove.

1005
00:42:12,833 --> 00:42:13,500
Incredible.

1006
00:42:13,600 --> 00:42:15,067
Teacher, you're so pretty.

1007
00:42:15,167 --> 00:42:15,900
Thanks.

1008
00:42:16,000 --> 00:42:17,500
Careful, pull it higher.

1009
00:42:19,867 --> 00:42:21,900
- Seems like it's not that problem.
- It's so pretty.

1010
00:42:22,000 --> 00:42:24,200
Its hole is too small.

1011
00:42:25,933 --> 00:42:26,667
Careful, it's hot.

1012
00:42:26,767 --> 00:42:28,167
It tastes delicious.

1013
00:42:28,967 --> 00:42:30,333
I wanna eat the seeds.

1014
00:42:30,433 --> 00:42:30,967
In general

1015
00:42:31,067 --> 00:42:33,933
we cleaned the seeds better.

1016
00:42:35,233 --> 00:42:37,533
- No necessarily.
- They have more pulp.

1017
00:42:37,633 --> 00:42:39,833
No idea why but theirs tastes sweeter.

1018
00:42:39,933 --> 00:42:41,333
It might be the sweat.

1019
00:42:42,067 --> 00:42:42,667
To balance the flavor.

1020
00:42:42,767 --> 00:42:44,700
So your sweat is sour?

1021
00:42:44,800 --> 00:42:47,333
Salty, so it balances out the sweetness.

1022
00:42:47,433 --> 00:42:49,567
On the scale of 10, I will give 12.

1023
00:42:49,667 --> 00:42:50,967
- Ours?
- Yeah.

1024
00:42:51,067 --> 00:42:52,533
Seriously? Thank you

1025
00:42:52,633 --> 00:42:53,733
I think it tastes great

1026
00:42:53,833 --> 00:42:55,667
I give ourselves 13

1027
00:42:55,767 --> 00:42:57,133
(his face drops)

1028
00:42:57,233 --> 00:42:58,500
(Can NIO's lame jokes continue
to attract Jia-Hang?) Screw you.

1029
00:42:59,600 --> 00:43:00,700
Screw you.

1030
00:43:04,200 --> 00:43:06,233
(Enjoy the dessert after making jam!)
- I'll take pictures for you - So pretty.

1031
00:43:06,333 --> 00:43:08,100
No way we said the same thing.

1032
00:43:09,400 --> 00:43:11,000
How cute

1033
00:43:11,533 --> 00:43:13,667
- 1 2 3
- Great, okay.

1034
00:43:13,727 --> 00:43:14,993
- Adorable.
- I'm gonna pretend to eat this

1035
00:43:15,133 --> 00:43:16,633
- I'll help you.
- Good.

1036
00:43:16,733 --> 00:43:17,733
The dance between me and him

1037
00:43:17,833 --> 00:43:19,267
is in a good place now.

1038
00:43:19,367 --> 00:43:22,267
Once I define this relationship

1039
00:43:22,367 --> 00:43:24,300
other than a friendly one.

1040
00:43:24,400 --> 00:43:25,600
Based on my personality

1041
00:43:25,700 --> 00:43:27,100
I'd walk around the egg shelves

1042
00:43:27,200 --> 00:43:29,867
but I want to face him with my truest self.

1043
00:43:29,967 --> 00:43:31,400
As for the move NIO made

1044
00:43:31,500 --> 00:43:33,667
I don't feel like speculating

1045
00:43:33,767 --> 00:43:36,433
because he is always nice to people

1046
00:43:36,533 --> 00:43:38,800
someone who loves to make friends.

1047
00:43:39,367 --> 00:43:41,100
Let me tell you a joke.

1048
00:43:41,200 --> 00:43:42,033
Didn't you say you want to

1049
00:43:42,133 --> 00:43:43,433
share something major?

1050
00:43:43,533 --> 00:43:44,300
This is it.

1051
00:43:44,400 --> 00:43:45,500
Sorry, this is that major thing?

1052
00:43:45,600 --> 00:43:46,767
- It's a joke.
- Okay.

1053
00:43:46,867 --> 00:43:48,867
Let's say I eat the dessert now

1054
00:43:48,967 --> 00:43:50,700
and out of a pure accident

1055
00:43:50,800 --> 00:43:53,200
some cream got on
this side of my mouth.

1056
00:43:53,300 --> 00:43:54,565
(This joke never gets
old... How will they react?)

1057
00:43:54,590 --> 00:43:56,767
Then guess what will I do to eat
that cream? To put it inside my mouth.

1058
00:43:56,867 --> 00:43:58,600
- Like this.
- With the hand.

1059
00:43:58,700 --> 00:44:00,367
Some people would do that, right?

1060
00:44:00,467 --> 00:44:03,267
But I chose to do this.

1061
00:44:03,367 --> 00:44:04,767
Alright, yes.

1062
00:44:04,867 --> 00:44:05,767
What if the cream

1063
00:44:05,867 --> 00:44:06,800
accidentally got itself here.

1064
00:44:06,900 --> 00:44:08,667
How would I deal with it?

1065
00:44:08,767 --> 00:44:09,833
How am I supposed to do?

1066
00:44:09,933 --> 00:44:10,800
If the cream was here earlier.

1067
00:44:10,900 --> 00:44:13,100
- In a way like this.
- Use another hand.

1068
00:44:13,200 --> 00:44:14,400
You'll use the other hand

1069
00:44:14,500 --> 00:44:15,333
and eat like this, right?

1070
00:44:15,433 --> 00:44:17,667
Yeah, I'll put it right here

1071
00:44:17,767 --> 00:44:19,367
and eat it like this

1072
00:44:20,367 --> 00:44:20,867
(amused)

1073
00:44:20,967 --> 00:44:22,900
He got it!

1074
00:44:23,733 --> 00:44:24,333
Why?

1075
00:44:24,433 --> 00:44:25,467
You...

1076
00:44:25,567 --> 00:44:27,167
(Only NIO appreciates Guan-Yu's punchline)
Why didn't you use another hand of yours?

1077
00:44:27,267 --> 00:44:28,100
Did you get my punchline?

1078
00:44:28,200 --> 00:44:30,733
Shih-Feng, I'm so lonely.

1079
00:44:30,833 --> 00:44:31,700
Are you lonely?

1080
00:44:31,800 --> 00:44:33,667
I'm not lonely

1081
00:44:33,900 --> 00:44:36,533
I feel like these three
people in this group

1082
00:44:36,633 --> 00:44:39,767
changes the whole dynamic.

1083
00:44:39,867 --> 00:44:40,900
It turns into something very fun.

1084
00:44:41,000 --> 00:44:42,767
Well, me and Jia-Hang

1085
00:44:42,867 --> 00:44:45,100
sometimes we would just

1086
00:44:45,200 --> 00:44:47,167
make silly jokes here and there.

1087
00:44:47,267 --> 00:44:48,767
And sometimes, he enjoys it a lot.

1088
00:44:48,867 --> 00:44:50,500
For other times, he becomes cynical.

1089
00:44:50,600 --> 00:44:52,700
Well, Guan-Yu is like that.

1090
00:44:52,800 --> 00:44:55,700
Shih-Feng is a very good friend

1091
00:44:55,800 --> 00:44:56,800
I think his existence

1092
00:44:56,900 --> 00:44:59,800
still brings a lot of positive energy.

1093
00:45:01,767 --> 00:45:04,567
(Would this jam-making group
bring about new shifts in dating?)

1094
00:45:09,500 --> 00:45:12,700
We're heading to a farm.

1095
00:45:12,800 --> 00:45:14,433
How would I know if it's ripe?

1096
00:45:14,608 --> 00:45:16,942
Alright, or let's eat this one

1097
00:45:16,967 --> 00:45:18,167
I couldn't find

1098
00:45:18,267 --> 00:45:19,567
a chance to reach out my hands

1099
00:45:19,667 --> 00:45:23,067
and to find someone who could save me.

1100
00:45:33,700 --> 00:45:34,167
Cool

1101
00:45:34,267 --> 00:45:35,833
I think it's a perfect opportunity

1102
00:45:35,933 --> 00:45:37,233
for me to get to know Susu better

1103
00:45:37,333 --> 00:45:39,100
since we've both grown so much.

1104
00:45:39,200 --> 00:45:41,633
Like we talked it all out.

1105
00:45:41,733 --> 00:45:44,000
It did make me feel better, yeah.

1106
00:45:44,467 --> 00:45:46,933
- Is it barbecue?
- It's barbecue.

1107
00:45:50,237 --> 00:45:51,767
Is there anything you guys wanna say

1108
00:45:51,867 --> 00:45:53,600
to the person you like?

1109
00:45:53,700 --> 00:45:55,300
Alright, I'm crazy about you.

1110
00:46:01,567 --> 00:46:04,300
(On the final night, under the
influence of alcohol and fireworks)

1111
00:46:04,400 --> 00:46:10,967
(The emotions and tears accumulating
for so long are now unstoppable...)

1112
00:46:11,067 --> 00:46:16,767
(Would they hear each other's
calling at the end of the love journey...)
