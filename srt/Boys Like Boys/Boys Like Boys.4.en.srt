1
00:00:01,367 --> 00:00:02,800
(Previously)
Is someone already back?

2
00:00:03,333 --> 00:00:05,033
Souvenirs?

3
00:00:08,067 --> 00:00:09,533
How come there's one more guest?

4
00:00:09,733 --> 00:00:11,267
But that would be the eighth, which means...

5
00:00:11,833 --> 00:00:12,933
There are eight people.

6
00:00:15,400 --> 00:00:16,733
- Nervous.
- Here he comes.

7
00:00:16,967 --> 00:00:17,867
Hello.

8
00:00:18,200 --> 00:00:19,733
Hi.

9
00:00:19,833 --> 00:00:21,667
Hey.

10
00:00:21,767 --> 00:00:22,567
Welcome.

11
00:00:26,400 --> 00:00:28,467
For two of our new members

12
00:00:28,567 --> 00:00:30,333
please invite someone tonight

13
00:00:32,333 --> 00:00:34,500
to join you for breakfast tomorrow morning.

14
00:00:36,233 --> 00:00:37,500
Woah.

15
00:00:38,167 --> 00:00:39,367
Oh my god.

16
00:00:47,900 --> 00:00:49,167
(Bobo)

17
00:00:49,267 --> 00:00:50,500
(Shih-Feng)

18
00:00:53,567 --> 00:00:54,933
(Guan-Yu)

19
00:00:55,033 --> 00:00:56,267
(Eri)

20
00:00:56,367 --> 00:00:57,967
(Susu)

21
00:00:58,067 --> 00:00:59,667
(Jia-Hang)

22
00:01:05,900 --> 00:01:08,933
(Episode 4:
You are sharing a bed with me, again)

23
00:01:18,567 --> 00:01:19,533
(Double Room/Eri, Bobo)

24
00:01:19,633 --> 00:01:21,033
(he bounces up immediately)

25
00:01:26,500 --> 00:01:27,867
It spooked me.

26
00:01:29,300 --> 00:01:30,600
I bounced right up.

27
00:01:32,200 --> 00:01:35,967
(Double Room/Susu, Jia-Hang)

28
00:01:39,067 --> 00:01:41,833
(Quadruple Room/Nio, Guan-Yu, Gino, Sh-Fung)
(Everyone starts to wake up...)

29
00:01:47,867 --> 00:01:48,800
Light's on.

30
00:01:48,900 --> 00:01:50,033
Alright.

31
00:01:53,700 --> 00:01:55,033
You'll be crying with the lights on

32
00:01:56,967 --> 00:01:59,100
(sleepy)

33
00:02:01,733 --> 00:02:05,567
(stretching underneath the sunlight..)

34
00:02:07,533 --> 00:02:11,400
(or working out...)

35
00:02:12,333 --> 00:02:13,667
Nah, I have to show to the camera

36
00:02:13,767 --> 00:02:15,333
the way my chest goes up and down

37
00:02:19,467 --> 00:02:21,833
(jumping up and down)
Let them see how your pants jump up and down.

38
00:02:21,933 --> 00:02:23,233
Would they want to see more of these?

39
00:02:23,333 --> 00:02:25,633
I'm not wearing any underwear, shoot
I almost pull it down.

40
00:02:25,733 --> 00:02:27,133
Horrifying.

41
00:02:27,900 --> 00:02:28,667
(The people in the quadruple are getting ready)

42
00:02:28,767 --> 00:02:30,567
I was just...

43
00:02:30,667 --> 00:02:32,367
I'm not feeling myself today

44
00:02:32,800 --> 00:02:33,333
(slip)
Jesus Christ.

45
00:02:33,433 --> 00:02:34,367
Watch out.

46
00:02:34,633 --> 00:02:36,200
- Did you just curse?
- Sorry (shocked!)

47
00:02:36,300 --> 00:02:38,767
- Awesome.
- Really.

48
00:02:38,867 --> 00:02:42,000
(On the third day, everyone is acting more like himself...)
I love the real Nio.

49
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:45,433
I'm nervous.

50
00:02:45,533 --> 00:02:47,833
(Susu and Jia-Hang have a mission this morning...)

51
00:02:47,933 --> 00:02:48,800
So nervous.

52
00:02:48,900 --> 00:02:49,833
About which part?

53
00:02:49,933 --> 00:02:51,233
I mean the part about the date.

54
00:02:58,833 --> 00:03:02,633
(They are about to have a date
with the person they invited yesterday)

55
00:03:05,200 --> 00:03:08,267
(Who got invited last night...?)

56
00:03:11,767 --> 00:03:13,333
Like, having a sore throat?

57
00:03:19,367 --> 00:03:20,300
What do you mean?

58
00:03:20,400 --> 00:03:21,767
There aren't people here.

59
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:24,500
It's chayote again

60
00:03:24,600 --> 00:03:25,900
I'm sitting with you again today.

61
00:03:27,267 --> 00:03:28,367
There are only four sets

62
00:03:28,467 --> 00:03:30,833
so only four people will be dining here.

63
00:03:33,133 --> 00:03:34,567
Taking a peek at the room.

64
00:03:37,133 --> 00:03:38,633
Hello? Is someone here?

65
00:03:38,733 --> 00:03:39,900
I'm gonna open the door
One, two, three.

66
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:41,600
(Double Room/Susu, Jia-Hang)
(empty room...)

67
00:03:41,700 --> 00:03:42,967
Alright, no one's here.

68
00:03:44,833 --> 00:03:46,133
It's just us?

69
00:03:46,233 --> 00:03:47,533
What do you mean?

70
00:03:48,100 --> 00:03:50,133
We're the broken-hearted group.

71
00:03:50,233 --> 00:03:52,700
It's just us here
We can dig right in.

72
00:03:53,933 --> 00:03:56,000
I don't think there are only us.

73
00:03:56,100 --> 00:03:57,433
- Here he comes.
- Hi.

74
00:03:57,533 --> 00:03:59,400
Gino's chicken breast is over here.

75
00:03:59,500 --> 00:04:00,100
Hello.

76
00:04:00,433 --> 00:04:01,833
Eri, your hair looks different today.

77
00:04:01,933 --> 00:04:02,667
Yeah.

78
00:04:02,767 --> 00:04:04,500
- It looks great.
- It really does.

79
00:04:04,600 --> 00:04:05,367
Really?

80
00:04:05,967 --> 00:04:06,933
(Shih-Feng and Guan-Yu join the breakfast...)
There's just the two of you.

81
00:04:07,033 --> 00:04:07,833
Yeah

82
00:04:07,933 --> 00:04:09,133
I knew it, look.

83
00:04:09,533 --> 00:04:10,333
Have you guys heard?

84
00:04:10,433 --> 00:04:11,533
Heard what?

85
00:04:12,467 --> 00:04:12,933
Why?

86
00:04:13,033 --> 00:04:14,500
How come you knew
there were only two of us here?

87
00:04:14,600 --> 00:04:16,700
Because there are only two over here

88
00:04:17,367 --> 00:04:18,633
(he suddenly gets the idea)

89
00:04:18,733 --> 00:04:20,300
So they scooped two people out.

90
00:04:20,400 --> 00:04:21,000
Yeah.

91
00:04:21,600 --> 00:04:23,267
(The rest of the four discuss the breakfast invites)
The camera crew took both of them

92
00:04:23,367 --> 00:04:25,433
into our room and invited people.

93
00:04:26,367 --> 00:04:28,300
To join them for breakfast.

94
00:04:28,400 --> 00:04:29,933
One for each, is that so?

95
00:04:31,367 --> 00:04:32,433
Then did you know

96
00:04:32,533 --> 00:04:34,333
whom they picked for breakfast yesterday?

97
00:04:35,133 --> 00:04:36,500
You guys knew it?

98
00:04:36,600 --> 00:04:37,267
We knew it

99
00:04:37,367 --> 00:04:38,700
(prying)
Tell me, I'm all ears.

100
00:04:39,333 --> 00:04:40,367
You love to gossip.

101
00:04:40,467 --> 00:04:41,400
Let me guess.

102
00:04:41,500 --> 00:04:42,767
Let me guess, will you?

103
00:04:43,767 --> 00:04:45,933
Well, Susu picked Gino.

104
00:04:46,600 --> 00:04:47,833
Susu picked Gino.

105
00:04:47,933 --> 00:04:48,800
Okay, and then what?

106
00:04:49,433 --> 00:04:50,833
And the rest is a pair.

107
00:04:51,267 --> 00:04:51,933
And...

108
00:04:52,033 --> 00:04:53,267
On the contrEri.

109
00:04:53,367 --> 00:04:54,300
Seriously?

110
00:04:55,300 --> 00:04:56,500
Time for breakfast.

111
00:04:59,633 --> 00:05:01,233
I think it's been years

112
00:05:01,900 --> 00:05:03,167
since I went on a picnic.

113
00:05:03,267 --> 00:05:04,833
So you've been here before?

114
00:05:04,933 --> 00:05:07,767
No, I mean the picnic.

115
00:05:08,133 --> 00:05:09,400
(Susu invited Nio to join him for breakfast)
I'm so not a nature person.

116
00:05:09,500 --> 00:05:10,667
It's alright. Me, either

117
00:05:10,767 --> 00:05:14,300
I'm a total city person.

118
00:05:14,500 --> 00:05:16,767
(Rewind to last night)

119
00:05:16,867 --> 00:05:18,400
Is Nio here?

120
00:05:18,500 --> 00:05:19,933
Hi,

121
00:05:21,033 --> 00:05:23,567
mission Well, I have a mission.

122
00:05:23,667 --> 00:05:25,233
It's, um...

123
00:05:25,333 --> 00:05:26,167
Tomorrow morning

124
00:05:26,267 --> 00:05:27,733
are you willing to join me for breakfast?

125
00:05:27,833 --> 00:05:28,533
Absolutely.

126
00:05:28,633 --> 00:05:31,167
(Nio said yes without hesitations!)
Alright, that's it. It's a deal.

127
00:05:31,267 --> 00:05:33,100
- Is this your mission?
- Yep.

128
00:05:33,200 --> 00:05:34,433
This is my mission.

129
00:05:34,533 --> 00:05:36,933
You come up with this mission?

130
00:05:37,033 --> 00:05:38,133
(Those two walk to a corner of the Lavender forest)
Yep.

131
00:05:39,300 --> 00:05:40,800
- Okay.
- Okay.

132
00:05:41,533 --> 00:05:43,167
There seem to be two cushions here.

133
00:05:43,267 --> 00:05:45,300
They told us to sit over here.

134
00:05:45,400 --> 00:05:47,233
Please, sorry
I just went straightforward.

135
00:05:47,333 --> 00:05:48,167
Okay.

136
00:05:52,300 --> 00:05:54,867
(On the other side Jia-Hang invited Gino to have breakfast)
When you met all of us yesterday

137
00:05:54,967 --> 00:05:59,033
is there someone that fits your type?

138
00:05:59,133 --> 00:06:00,600
Or someone you prefer?

139
00:06:00,700 --> 00:06:02,700
Since we haven't gotten to know each other

140
00:06:02,800 --> 00:06:05,167
I couldn't make up my mind.

141
00:06:05,267 --> 00:06:06,133
- Yeah.
- Hmm.

142
00:06:06,233 --> 00:06:08,733
That's why I asked you out.

143
00:06:08,833 --> 00:06:11,400
You picked me first?

144
00:06:11,500 --> 00:06:13,600
Because we didn't get to talk much

145
00:06:13,700 --> 00:06:16,700
I'm kind of curious about you, yeah

146
00:06:16,833 --> 00:06:19,633
(the invite last night)

147
00:06:19,733 --> 00:06:21,800
Is this a quadruple? This is amazing.

148
00:06:21,900 --> 00:06:23,000
Yeah.

149
00:06:23,400 --> 00:06:25,000
Do you want to have breakfast
with me tomorrow?

150
00:06:25,100 --> 00:06:26,733
- Me?
- Yah.

151
00:06:26,833 --> 00:06:27,833
Do I have the honor?

152
00:06:27,933 --> 00:06:28,967
Sure you do.

153
00:06:29,067 --> 00:06:30,000
Alright.

154
00:06:30,100 --> 00:06:30,833
Yeah, really?

155
00:06:30,933 --> 00:06:31,467
Yes.

156
00:06:31,567 --> 00:06:32,267
Great, fantastic?

157
00:06:32,367 --> 00:06:33,533
Awesome.

158
00:06:35,400 --> 00:06:36,133
Yeah, what about you?

159
00:06:36,233 --> 00:06:39,900
Do you have someone in mind?

160
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:41,133
Yeah...

161
00:06:41,233 --> 00:06:42,033
You do?

162
00:06:42,133 --> 00:06:44,500
Within three days, okay.

163
00:06:44,600 --> 00:06:45,967
But I feel like

164
00:06:46,067 --> 00:06:48,667
I feel like everyone is...

165
00:06:49,233 --> 00:06:51,433
Still getting to know each other.

166
00:06:51,533 --> 00:06:52,233
Of course.

167
00:06:53,533 --> 00:06:54,600
Sit, yeah.

168
00:06:56,333 --> 00:06:58,600
(Meanwhile, those four are enjoying the breakfast...)
I think they use picnic baskets there, cute.

169
00:06:59,433 --> 00:07:01,367
Picnic baskets seem to suit me more.

170
00:07:03,867 --> 00:07:06,500
- Picnic baskets.
- They sound lovely

171
00:07:06,600 --> 00:07:08,033
I'm taking these baskets out now.

172
00:07:09,400 --> 00:07:11,200
- Picnic.
- That's one way you do it.

173
00:07:13,567 --> 00:07:14,567
It's hilarious.

174
00:07:16,233 --> 00:07:18,067
I'm digging in now.

175
00:07:18,700 --> 00:07:21,000
So you speak quite a lot of languages.

176
00:07:21,100 --> 00:07:23,167
Nah, not that many.

177
00:07:23,267 --> 00:07:24,700
- Here and there.
- Yeah, here and there.

178
00:07:24,800 --> 00:07:27,133
On the first day when I joined the show

179
00:07:27,233 --> 00:07:29,700
I saw the pictures of six of you

180
00:07:30,133 --> 00:07:34,833
image And your image differs the most

181
00:07:34,933 --> 00:07:36,900
from the one in person.

182
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:37,833
You are a lot more...

183
00:07:37,933 --> 00:07:38,833
What's the difference?

184
00:07:38,933 --> 00:07:41,533
A lot brighter, yeah.

185
00:07:41,633 --> 00:07:42,567
You are a lot brighter than I imagined.

186
00:07:42,667 --> 00:07:44,833
(They talk about their first impressions...)
You thought I looked gloomy, didn't you?

187
00:07:44,933 --> 00:07:46,367
From what I've seen in the photo.

188
00:07:46,467 --> 00:07:47,567
Yeah, besides.

189
00:07:47,667 --> 00:07:49,033
They told me about the mixed-race.

190
00:07:49,133 --> 00:07:50,567
To be honest, none of that...

191
00:07:50,667 --> 00:07:51,200
Like, completely

192
00:07:51,300 --> 00:07:52,833
I didn't recognize that part

193
00:07:52,933 --> 00:07:54,267
from your picture

194
00:07:54,367 --> 00:07:56,933
I mean, the mixed race.

195
00:07:57,033 --> 00:07:58,600
Personally, I think when I speak

196
00:07:58,700 --> 00:08:00,067
eye contact I love making eye contacts.

197
00:08:00,167 --> 00:08:01,467
Yeah, you know

198
00:08:01,567 --> 00:08:03,133
I like looking into their eyes and talk.

199
00:08:03,233 --> 00:08:04,367
And I feel like.

200
00:08:04,767 --> 00:08:06,833
Sometimes, you can't see that interaction

201
00:08:06,933 --> 00:08:09,233
when you look at the pictures.

202
00:08:09,333 --> 00:08:12,200
That's also the limitations of the dating apps.

203
00:08:12,300 --> 00:08:13,933
Isn't that right?

204
00:08:14,033 --> 00:08:17,667
We rely on the pictures so much
that we didn't...

205
00:08:18,733 --> 00:08:20,733
Give someone an opportunity.

206
00:08:20,833 --> 00:08:23,200
We give the image an opportunity.

207
00:08:23,733 --> 00:08:27,467
Honestly, I didn't expect him to choose me
to join him for the breakfast.

208
00:08:27,567 --> 00:08:29,867
Because I called him yesterday

209
00:08:30,533 --> 00:08:32,033
he seemed pretty chill about it.

210
00:08:32,133 --> 00:08:34,200
That's why I thought

211
00:08:34,300 --> 00:08:36,200
he might not be that interested in me.

212
00:08:37,333 --> 00:08:40,200
But talking to him is kind of a pleasure

213
00:08:40,300 --> 00:08:42,833
I opened most of the conversations.

214
00:08:42,933 --> 00:08:44,567
Yeah, he might be a little anxious

215
00:08:44,667 --> 00:08:46,400
about the interactions, so...

216
00:08:46,500 --> 00:08:47,100
That's all good

217
00:08:47,200 --> 00:08:49,800
I'm happy to start all sorts of topics going.

218
00:08:49,900 --> 00:08:50,700
And...

219
00:08:50,800 --> 00:08:52,300
it went smoothly.

220
00:08:52,400 --> 00:08:54,600
He is really kind
Everything was smooth

221
00:08:54,700 --> 00:08:56,167
without any hiccups.

222
00:08:57,200 --> 00:08:58,433
Sometimes, I'm very straightforward.

223
00:08:58,533 --> 00:09:00,767
A lot of times I'm scared

224
00:09:00,867 --> 00:09:02,867
that sometimes being this direct

225
00:09:03,167 --> 00:09:05,067
could possibly make people

226
00:09:05,167 --> 00:09:07,100
feel uncomfortable or hurt them.

227
00:09:07,200 --> 00:09:08,333
Well, I've seen a lot

228
00:09:08,433 --> 00:09:10,167
of comments on the Youtube channel

229
00:09:10,267 --> 00:09:11,967
left by those haters.

230
00:09:12,067 --> 00:09:13,900
(Sharing their perspectives on the online comments)
Yeah, when I was feeling...

231
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:15,000
Not feeling my best self.

232
00:09:15,100 --> 00:09:16,633
When I read those...

233
00:09:16,733 --> 00:09:18,733
When I read those comments left by others

234
00:09:18,833 --> 00:09:21,233
in the state when I wasn't so happy.

235
00:09:21,333 --> 00:09:23,267
- They were hater, after all.
- Yeah.

236
00:09:23,367 --> 00:09:25,200
But, whatever you do.

237
00:09:25,300 --> 00:09:26,633
You couldn't make everyone happy.

238
00:09:26,733 --> 00:09:28,467
So be yourself then.

239
00:09:28,567 --> 00:09:30,000
That's what I think of it.

240
00:09:30,100 --> 00:09:32,433
Haters create those click rates as well.

241
00:09:32,533 --> 00:09:34,167
So, if you don't like me

242
00:09:34,267 --> 00:09:36,800
why would you spend time watching my videos?

243
00:09:37,367 --> 00:09:40,133
It's not necessarily a bad thing to have haters.

244
00:09:40,233 --> 00:09:41,233
Understood.

245
00:09:42,100 --> 00:09:43,833
Not far from what I expected

246
00:09:43,933 --> 00:09:44,933
I feel like, the personality of his

247
00:09:45,033 --> 00:09:46,700
is a perfect fit for the friendship.

248
00:09:46,800 --> 00:09:49,100
Our point of view are a match.

249
00:09:49,200 --> 00:09:52,033
However, it's just...

250
00:09:52,133 --> 00:09:53,700
That's all.

251
00:09:53,800 --> 00:09:55,433
It's so hard to explain this, you know.

252
00:09:55,533 --> 00:09:56,567
For example, when I see a guy

253
00:09:56,667 --> 00:09:58,700
and we talk for a brief moment.

254
00:09:58,800 --> 00:10:01,300
(Their date doesn't seem to ignite the romantic sparkle)
My interest in him may deepen after conversations.

255
00:10:01,400 --> 00:10:02,933
And I didn't have that feeling for him.

256
00:10:12,033 --> 00:10:13,200
Alright, you chose me.

257
00:10:13,300 --> 00:10:14,700
So what did you want to talk about?

258
00:10:16,067 --> 00:10:17,467
Nothing, just wanting to chat with you more.

259
00:10:18,033 --> 00:10:18,867
All sorts of topics.

260
00:10:18,967 --> 00:10:20,000
Yeah, random topics.

261
00:10:20,300 --> 00:10:23,133
Cause you guys were pretty serious yesterday.

262
00:10:23,233 --> 00:10:24,667
Not serious, I mean.

263
00:10:24,767 --> 00:10:26,467
You guys talked about some really deep stuff.

264
00:10:26,567 --> 00:10:29,200
The topic yesterday was far too heavy.

265
00:10:29,533 --> 00:10:31,033
- Yeah.
- Extremely deep.

266
00:10:31,133 --> 00:10:32,933
(The question raised by Jia-Hang caused quite a stir...)
I was wondering

267
00:10:33,033 --> 00:10:36,233
if you guys have talked about each other.

268
00:10:36,333 --> 00:10:39,200
The roles you represent, I mean in bed.

269
00:10:39,833 --> 00:10:41,933
Only those who feel comfortable talk about it.

270
00:10:42,367 --> 00:10:42,933
Can I not talk about it?

271
00:10:43,033 --> 00:10:45,733
We can't talk about roles in a dating show?

272
00:10:45,833 --> 00:10:47,600
I think comfort is the main key.

273
00:10:47,700 --> 00:10:49,900
Because it's very private and personal.

274
00:10:51,667 --> 00:10:54,900
Like our previous topic was
about first love and first night.

275
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:56,600
On that topic, someone did say

276
00:10:56,700 --> 00:10:58,200
that he felt like it was personal

277
00:10:58,300 --> 00:11:00,967
and he didn't feel like sharing it.

278
00:11:02,133 --> 00:11:03,300
(Gino shares his true feelings from last night...)
And when you raised that question

279
00:11:03,400 --> 00:11:05,233
I suddenly felt the same way about the topic

280
00:11:05,333 --> 00:11:06,867
- I felt like...
- Don't feel like sharing it?

281
00:11:06,967 --> 00:11:08,567
Yeah, it made me feel like.

282
00:11:09,233 --> 00:11:10,033
It was too soon.

283
00:11:10,133 --> 00:11:12,567
Not that I didn't want to share
but it was too fast.

284
00:11:12,767 --> 00:11:15,600
So when you first meet people
would you...

285
00:11:15,700 --> 00:11:18,233
cut to the chase very quickly like this?

286
00:11:18,833 --> 00:11:21,033
Yeah, I guess I'm used to it.

287
00:11:21,433 --> 00:11:23,300
(Jia-Hang explains the reason behind asking this question)
For most of the time, the reason I meet new people

288
00:11:23,400 --> 00:11:26,133
is mainly because
I want to take pictures of him.

289
00:11:26,233 --> 00:11:29,133
Yeah, I'm a photographer

290
00:11:29,233 --> 00:11:31,867
I might ask more questions, for example

291
00:11:31,967 --> 00:11:33,300
his relationship status

292
00:11:33,400 --> 00:11:34,567
how he was before

293
00:11:34,667 --> 00:11:37,033
or the current identity and role

294
00:11:37,133 --> 00:11:39,400
I think these are excellent backgrounds

295
00:11:39,500 --> 00:11:40,300
when doing a photoshoot.

296
00:11:40,400 --> 00:11:42,067
A background check, yeah.

297
00:11:42,167 --> 00:11:43,767
Dating apps primEri are a tool

298
00:11:43,867 --> 00:11:45,333
for looking for a model

299
00:11:45,433 --> 00:11:48,000
I don't use dating apps
for searching for a partner.

300
00:11:48,367 --> 00:11:49,167
Cool

301
00:11:49,533 --> 00:11:51,167
I've photographed a pretty cool them

302
00:11:51,267 --> 00:11:53,733
which was to find different people
for a year

303
00:11:53,833 --> 00:11:54,433
and asked them

304
00:11:54,533 --> 00:11:56,367
I asked them on the dating app

305
00:11:56,467 --> 00:11:57,633
whether I could come to his place.

306
00:11:57,733 --> 00:11:58,933
Regardless of what we were gonna do.

307
00:11:59,033 --> 00:12:01,467
We might talk, drink, or...

308
00:12:01,567 --> 00:12:03,267
possibly move on to having sex.

309
00:12:03,367 --> 00:12:05,167
And whether I could take pictures.

310
00:12:05,267 --> 00:12:07,767
And on that day, on that specific night

311
00:12:07,867 --> 00:12:09,667
I wanted to try and experiment

312
00:12:09,767 --> 00:12:12,533
to see how much closer I could get to your life

313
00:12:12,633 --> 00:12:14,700
(surprised)
There were about 50 people participating.

314
00:12:15,800 --> 00:12:17,367
I just kept taking pictures...

315
00:12:17,467 --> 00:12:20,000
This is, so...

316
00:12:21,667 --> 00:12:24,200
What was special about
our conversations is that

317
00:12:24,300 --> 00:12:26,500
I would emphasize on the sex part

318
00:12:26,600 --> 00:12:27,900
to have this talk with him.

319
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:30,133
Actually, I've realized

320
00:12:30,233 --> 00:12:34,867
that it is just one of his hobbies

321
00:12:34,967 --> 00:12:39,133
or a habit, a behavior.

322
00:12:39,233 --> 00:12:43,533
Essentially, I feel like
he is quite like an artist.

323
00:12:43,700 --> 00:12:45,967
Do you think your heart
is filled with brightness or darkness?

324
00:12:46,067 --> 00:12:47,433
I'm super dark

325
00:12:47,533 --> 00:12:50,100
I can't wait to see people embarrass themselves.

326
00:12:50,200 --> 00:12:51,333
So you like watching people's bloopers.

327
00:12:51,433 --> 00:12:52,600
Yeah...

328
00:12:53,400 --> 00:12:55,567
Then what could you get from that?
Just feeling happy?

329
00:12:55,667 --> 00:12:56,367
Well, satisfied.

330
00:12:56,467 --> 00:12:57,400
Being like, ahahah?

331
00:12:57,500 --> 00:13:00,000
That's enough for me today
I'm heading home to sleep.

332
00:13:00,500 --> 00:13:02,367
My personality is so evil.

333
00:13:02,467 --> 00:13:04,667
It is created to be this evil.

334
00:13:04,767 --> 00:13:07,400
After talking to him
I feel like he is actually

335
00:13:07,500 --> 00:13:09,733
someone from another universe.

336
00:13:09,833 --> 00:13:10,667
That's how I feel.

337
00:13:10,767 --> 00:13:12,833
But he is still someone

338
00:13:12,933 --> 00:13:13,933
who craves love

339
00:13:14,033 --> 00:13:16,567
and years for the things he is after.

340
00:13:17,133 --> 00:13:18,667
Can I ask...

341
00:13:18,767 --> 00:13:22,600
(Jia-Hang asks Gino about his crush...)
You mentioned he sleeps in your room.

342
00:13:22,700 --> 00:13:24,333
You've got four roommates, right?

343
00:13:24,433 --> 00:13:27,533
I guess he goes by the English name.

344
00:13:28,100 --> 00:13:29,067
Which one?

345
00:13:29,167 --> 00:13:30,500
There's only one for that.

346
00:13:30,600 --> 00:13:31,967
What's he called? In case you forget

347
00:13:32,067 --> 00:13:32,867
I remember his name.

348
00:13:32,967 --> 00:13:33,667
Okay.

349
00:13:33,767 --> 00:13:34,667
Are we gonna spoil it?

350
00:13:34,767 --> 00:13:35,967
Not at all.

351
00:13:36,067 --> 00:13:37,233
No.

352
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:38,933
Nah, no.

353
00:13:39,033 --> 00:13:40,267
Yes.

354
00:13:44,433 --> 00:13:45,667
Seriously?

355
00:13:45,767 --> 00:13:46,633
Seriously.

356
00:13:46,733 --> 00:13:47,867
Who is it?

357
00:13:48,067 --> 00:13:48,767
It's him.

358
00:13:48,867 --> 00:13:50,033
Who is he?

359
00:13:50,267 --> 00:13:52,200
(Who exactly are they talking about...)
No way. So you are into that type.

360
00:13:52,300 --> 00:13:55,000
Who? I didn't say who.

361
00:13:55,100 --> 00:13:55,800
Does he do massages?

362
00:13:55,900 --> 00:13:56,867
He does massages.

363
00:13:58,433 --> 00:14:00,467
He was chatting with you yesterday.

364
00:14:00,567 --> 00:14:03,167
The one who said you looked like my ex.

365
00:14:03,267 --> 00:14:04,767
How come you knew about this?

366
00:14:04,867 --> 00:14:06,267
He shared with us.

367
00:14:06,367 --> 00:14:07,267
We always talk in our room.

368
00:14:07,367 --> 00:14:08,500
How did you...

369
00:14:08,600 --> 00:14:11,233
Were you listening the whole time
with the headphones on?

370
00:14:11,333 --> 00:14:12,633
We chat about everything.

371
00:14:12,967 --> 00:14:13,933
Yeah.

372
00:14:14,033 --> 00:14:16,400
But you... plan to do the long distance?

373
00:14:17,733 --> 00:14:18,233
What? What's wrong?

374
00:14:18,333 --> 00:14:20,733
I asked him about this.

375
00:14:20,833 --> 00:14:22,700
- He said.
- Seems like...

376
00:14:23,333 --> 00:14:26,033
He said yes.

377
00:14:26,133 --> 00:14:28,267
- But honestly.
- What your heart...

378
00:14:28,367 --> 00:14:30,333
I think it'll take work.

379
00:14:30,433 --> 00:14:33,000
It requires effort, but I'm willing to try.

380
00:14:33,100 --> 00:14:34,600
- Because I've never done it.
- Seriously?

381
00:14:34,700 --> 00:14:37,733
My previous four relationships
weren't long-distance.

382
00:14:37,833 --> 00:14:39,433
(On this casual morning they've delved deeper into the topics)
You know, in early stages when you're on a car

383
00:14:39,533 --> 00:14:41,200
or on a place, you may feel

384
00:14:41,300 --> 00:14:43,233
- excited.
- Very excited about meeting him.

385
00:14:43,333 --> 00:14:44,833
- However, after a long time.
- You'll get exhausted.

386
00:14:44,933 --> 00:14:46,567
It'll be hard.

387
00:14:47,067 --> 00:14:49,600
Besides, I'm not someone who loves face-time

388
00:14:49,700 --> 00:14:51,133
as a way to connect.

389
00:14:51,233 --> 00:14:53,967
Perhaps you'll find a more interesting way.

390
00:14:54,067 --> 00:14:57,800
Like, face-timing or phone sex.

391
00:14:58,133 --> 00:15:01,333
Those things are so old-fashioned
What am I saying?

392
00:15:02,067 --> 00:15:03,400
- So?
- I'm full now.

393
00:15:04,733 --> 00:15:05,400
Wrap it up.

394
00:15:06,033 --> 00:15:07,267
(People at the cabin finished their breakfast and started to chat)
Or you guys can sit for a bit more.

395
00:15:07,367 --> 00:15:08,367
- Sit.
- Take a seat

396
00:15:08,467 --> 00:15:09,933
I'll just sit. I don't wanna move.

397
00:15:10,767 --> 00:15:11,633
They aren't gonna.

398
00:15:11,733 --> 00:15:13,800
- They won't be here any minute soon, anyways.
- Yeah.

399
00:15:14,167 --> 00:15:15,267
What time will they get back?

400
00:15:15,367 --> 00:15:16,267
We are whining here.

401
00:15:16,367 --> 00:15:17,000
No idea.

402
00:15:17,100 --> 00:15:17,933
Nope, we have to cheer up.

403
00:15:18,033 --> 00:15:20,033
We are not whining.

404
00:15:20,133 --> 00:15:22,233
Sitting here is delightful.

405
00:15:22,333 --> 00:15:24,400
Then I'm going back to sleep.

406
00:15:27,733 --> 00:15:29,833
If we come in July or August

407
00:15:29,933 --> 00:15:30,633
we'll be miserable.

408
00:15:30,733 --> 00:15:32,067
- Yeah.
- Very miserable.

409
00:15:32,167 --> 00:15:33,833
It's not that hot yet, truly.

410
00:15:34,633 --> 00:15:35,733
(After spending some time,
they seem to be more comfortable...)

411
00:15:35,833 --> 00:15:37,000
Sorry.

412
00:15:41,367 --> 00:15:42,767
Sorry, I'm more old-fashioned.

413
00:15:51,667 --> 00:15:54,833
(Double Room/Eri, Bobo) (Taking a break after breakfast)
Susu snatched your Nio away.

414
00:15:57,233 --> 00:15:58,967
Nah, I've got a hunch that he adores

415
00:15:59,067 --> 00:16:00,500
someone like Nio.

416
00:16:00,600 --> 00:16:01,700
Did not come as a surprise.

417
00:16:01,800 --> 00:16:04,800
Nio's got a face that a lot of people will like.

418
00:16:06,033 --> 00:16:07,000
Face?

419
00:16:07,267 --> 00:16:08,400
Nio's face

420
00:16:08,500 --> 00:16:09,633
I can't, seriously.

421
00:16:09,733 --> 00:16:11,733
Because he is higher and you don't like that.

422
00:16:11,833 --> 00:16:13,233
Nah, even if he's short
I won't like him

423
00:16:13,333 --> 00:16:14,400
I genuinely don't like foreigners

424
00:16:14,500 --> 00:16:15,733
I mean it

425
00:16:15,833 --> 00:16:16,300
I feel like...

426
00:16:16,400 --> 00:16:18,500
His face doesn't scream
foreigners to me, though.

427
00:16:18,600 --> 00:16:19,800
As long as it looks like one

428
00:16:19,900 --> 00:16:21,267
there's no way I'll accept that.

429
00:16:21,433 --> 00:16:22,467
(The new members finished their dates and got back to the cabin)
Are you guys finished?

430
00:16:22,567 --> 00:16:24,267
There is bread

431
00:16:24,367 --> 00:16:26,067
I'm gonna share it with Bobo.

432
00:16:26,633 --> 00:16:28,067
Bobo is full today.

433
00:16:28,167 --> 00:16:30,467
Where did you guys have your breakfast?

434
00:16:30,567 --> 00:16:32,167
Around the merry-go-around.

435
00:16:33,200 --> 00:16:34,033
Hi.

436
00:16:34,367 --> 00:16:35,700
Hello.

437
00:16:36,833 --> 00:16:38,267
How's the food?

438
00:16:39,267 --> 00:16:40,533
It's great.

439
00:16:40,633 --> 00:16:42,767
Did you guys speak English all the way through?

440
00:16:42,867 --> 00:16:43,533
No.

441
00:16:43,633 --> 00:16:44,733
What a pity.

442
00:16:44,833 --> 00:16:46,267
Full English?

443
00:16:46,367 --> 00:16:49,200
Not all the time, but some.

444
00:16:49,300 --> 00:16:51,567
Some Japanese, though.

445
00:16:51,667 --> 00:16:57,767
A little bit, mixing with some words.

446
00:16:57,867 --> 00:16:59,533
How's it going?

447
00:16:59,633 --> 00:17:00,633
- Not bad.
- Good.

448
00:17:00,733 --> 00:17:02,933
Um, I think it went really well.

449
00:17:03,033 --> 00:17:04,667
This is how I feel about it.

450
00:17:06,833 --> 00:17:09,367
The last I want to do
is to go out right now.

451
00:17:09,467 --> 00:17:11,433
But it'll be weird if we don't.

452
00:17:11,533 --> 00:17:13,367
It'll be super weird and strange, but...

453
00:17:13,467 --> 00:17:15,033
Alright, let's go out, come on

454
00:17:15,133 --> 00:17:17,233
I don't want to socialize again.

455
00:17:20,233 --> 00:17:23,233
You're good, nice.

456
00:17:23,333 --> 00:17:24,533
Great flexibility.

457
00:17:24,633 --> 00:17:25,867
Hi.

458
00:17:26,100 --> 00:17:28,633
Morning, Bobo Morning, Eri.

459
00:17:28,733 --> 00:17:30,600
You look cute today.

460
00:17:30,700 --> 00:17:31,600
It suits you.

461
00:17:31,700 --> 00:17:32,933
What a cute outfit.

462
00:17:34,933 --> 00:17:38,633
(Those eight people reunite again)

463
00:17:40,133 --> 00:17:42,067
He might be wondering
why everyone was out here.

464
00:17:42,167 --> 00:17:43,333
We both were watching the video

465
00:17:43,433 --> 00:17:45,367
of you singing last night.

466
00:17:46,167 --> 00:17:48,233
You mean the Jungle Voice one?

467
00:17:48,333 --> 00:17:48,933
Yeah.

468
00:17:49,033 --> 00:17:50,433
Embarrassing.

469
00:17:50,533 --> 00:17:51,567
Not at all

470
00:17:51,667 --> 00:17:55,467
(but Bobo went back to his room...)

471
00:17:57,867 --> 00:17:59,367
(Susu is checking on Guan-Yu, who just finished stretching...)
Trying to warm up my body

472
00:17:59,467 --> 00:18:00,333
I thought I'd do a quick stretch

473
00:18:00,433 --> 00:18:02,133
but there was some time left.

474
00:18:02,233 --> 00:18:03,533
My right side has warmed up

475
00:18:03,633 --> 00:18:06,133
but there's no time for my left side.

476
00:18:08,633 --> 00:18:10,600
Have you guys been back long?

477
00:18:10,700 --> 00:18:12,233
Around five minutes?

478
00:18:12,333 --> 00:18:13,167
Oh, yeah?

479
00:18:20,567 --> 00:18:22,067
(getting up)

480
00:18:24,767 --> 00:18:26,067
Someone's mad, huh.

481
00:18:26,167 --> 00:18:27,400
(Gino offers Gan-Yu his help)
- Mad at what? - Let me help you.

482
00:18:27,500 --> 00:18:28,633
Nah.

483
00:18:29,267 --> 00:18:31,467
- Just taking it slow.
- You're sweating

484
00:18:32,667 --> 00:18:34,067
(secretly observing)

485
00:18:37,367 --> 00:18:40,167
I think he tries really hard to act
like nothing happens.

486
00:18:40,267 --> 00:18:42,367
You know, acting like
he's not going after Guan-Yu.

487
00:18:42,467 --> 00:18:43,900
But I feel like

488
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:46,533
it is very obvious to see

489
00:18:46,633 --> 00:18:47,933
he's got special treatment.

490
00:18:48,033 --> 00:18:50,000
So, every time when he is with Guan-Yu.

491
00:18:50,100 --> 00:18:51,933
Nio and I will be like.

492
00:18:52,033 --> 00:18:54,200
We glance at each other
and understand what he's up to.

493
00:18:54,300 --> 00:18:57,867
The moment we see him doing that, yeah.

494
00:18:57,967 --> 00:19:00,867
(Who kind of activities await them
on this beautiful bright day...)

495
00:19:04,833 --> 00:19:07,800
Please prepare an outfit to get changed

496
00:19:07,900 --> 00:19:09,367
after workout.

497
00:19:12,400 --> 00:19:13,833
In the bag or on your back?

498
00:19:13,933 --> 00:19:14,667
Well, I'm using your bag.

499
00:19:14,767 --> 00:19:15,833
Woah.

500
00:19:17,667 --> 00:19:19,533
Can you put this in my backpack?

501
00:19:20,500 --> 00:19:21,700
I'm going on a field trip.

502
00:19:21,800 --> 00:19:22,833
Yeah.

503
00:19:32,600 --> 00:19:34,933
(With these workout clothes on, where are they going?)
Wow, you guys look adorable.

504
00:19:41,667 --> 00:19:43,333
You sure you wanna sit with me?

505
00:19:43,433 --> 00:19:44,333
I'm chatty.

506
00:19:44,433 --> 00:19:46,100
You are not

507
00:19:46,933 --> 00:19:48,533
I'll doze off the next second
tell you this.

508
00:19:48,867 --> 00:19:50,500
- Yeah?
- I'm gonna wake you up.

509
00:19:50,600 --> 00:19:52,100
Yeah, he'll take pictures of you.

510
00:20:00,333 --> 00:20:03,900
(What will happen on their first trip out...)

511
00:20:18,433 --> 00:20:20,633
One thing I've noticed about Nio

512
00:20:20,733 --> 00:20:23,533
is that he cares more about Eri now.

513
00:20:23,633 --> 00:20:25,867
If each of us was taking a seat

514
00:20:25,967 --> 00:20:29,233
he wouldn't sit near Eri on purpose.

515
00:20:29,733 --> 00:20:32,133
Slightly, I can sense the change.

516
00:20:32,233 --> 00:20:34,767
(Is the plan with Bobo working?)
He made Nio pay more attention to me

517
00:20:34,867 --> 00:20:36,433
but I have no clue what Nio is thinking.

518
00:20:40,600 --> 00:20:41,567
There are chicken.

519
00:20:41,967 --> 00:20:42,500
There really are.

520
00:20:42,600 --> 00:20:43,533
Pretty.

521
00:20:45,800 --> 00:20:48,033
Don't tell me the chicken
on our table yesterday

522
00:20:48,700 --> 00:20:50,567
- was from here.
- The crew caught them down here.

523
00:20:51,833 --> 00:20:54,867
No wonder they recruit an aboriginal.

524
00:20:54,967 --> 00:20:56,067
You're Amis, right?

525
00:20:56,167 --> 00:20:56,767
Yeah, I am.

526
00:20:56,967 --> 00:20:58,900
Did you take the language test?

527
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:00,467
Yeah, intermediate level.

528
00:21:00,900 --> 00:21:02,700
- Intermediate is nice.
- That is sick.

529
00:21:02,800 --> 00:21:04,067
Intermediate is not bad.

530
00:21:04,167 --> 00:21:06,067
Then can you humor us with a sentence?

531
00:21:06,167 --> 00:21:08,267
(Bobo is teaching his tribe's language)

532
00:21:08,367 --> 00:21:12,267
maolahkakotisowanan.

533
00:21:12,367 --> 00:21:14,000
Take a guess of its meaning.

534
00:21:14,100 --> 00:21:15,100
The correct pronunciation would be...

535
00:21:15,200 --> 00:21:18,167
maolahkakotisowanan.

536
00:21:21,500 --> 00:21:22,567
What about your name?

537
00:21:22,667 --> 00:21:23,833
My name is.

538
00:21:24,133 --> 00:21:27,167
Idek.

539
00:21:27,267 --> 00:21:30,833
- Idek.
- Idek.

540
00:21:30,933 --> 00:21:31,667
And its meaning?

541
00:21:31,767 --> 00:21:35,933
Well, it actually means rainbow

542
00:21:43,233 --> 00:21:43,767
(shaking)

543
00:21:51,133 --> 00:21:52,300
(being sweet)
Nah, everyone doze off.

544
00:21:55,667 --> 00:21:57,333
(Gino seems to know the destination...)

545
00:21:57,433 --> 00:21:58,800
I know where we are going.

546
00:22:00,333 --> 00:22:00,900
Huh?

547
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:01,933
Divecube.

548
00:22:02,033 --> 00:22:03,433
No way

549
00:22:03,533 --> 00:22:05,433
I didn't bring goggles.

550
00:22:05,533 --> 00:22:06,433
Where to?

551
00:22:06,533 --> 00:22:07,167
Oh my god.

552
00:22:07,267 --> 00:22:07,900
Where to?

553
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:09,233
I didn't read the maps.

554
00:22:09,333 --> 00:22:11,867
(And this building is...)

555
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:14,333
(Taichung, Divecube)

556
00:22:15,567 --> 00:22:17,133
Oh, no way.

557
00:22:17,233 --> 00:22:19,133
Everyone knows about this.

558
00:22:19,733 --> 00:22:21,600
Eri, what's with that face?

559
00:22:21,700 --> 00:22:22,633
He's not happy.

560
00:22:22,733 --> 00:22:24,833
Because it'll take forever to blow-dry his hair.

561
00:22:32,567 --> 00:22:33,300
Go Go Go.

562
00:22:33,400 --> 00:22:35,433
Wow, it's Divecube.

563
00:22:35,633 --> 00:22:38,867
(Bobo and Gino both love water and this place)

564
00:22:38,967 --> 00:22:40,367
Someone's hyped.

565
00:22:40,467 --> 00:22:41,067
You move like a breeze

566
00:22:41,167 --> 00:22:42,467
(as keen as mustard)
Are you waiting for them?

567
00:22:42,567 --> 00:22:43,933
What on earth.

568
00:22:44,033 --> 00:22:44,933
He moves super fast.

569
00:22:45,033 --> 00:22:46,033
Doesn't he love diving?

570
00:22:46,133 --> 00:22:47,600
- Diving.
- Yeah.

571
00:22:47,700 --> 00:22:49,033
Welcome.

572
00:22:49,567 --> 00:22:50,900
It's like coming to his home.

573
00:22:51,633 --> 00:22:53,000
You've been here, Bobo?

574
00:22:53,100 --> 00:22:55,767
I've never been here before
I'm so hyped.

575
00:22:56,800 --> 00:23:00,800
(Get change and jump into the water!)

576
00:23:03,100 --> 00:23:04,333
Get change.

577
00:23:04,433 --> 00:23:06,300
Mine is this one.

578
00:23:06,400 --> 00:23:07,100
This is mine.

579
00:23:07,200 --> 00:23:08,000
Mine.

580
00:23:18,533 --> 00:23:21,467
(What will happen at the pool today...)

581
00:23:23,833 --> 00:23:25,967
Wow, the swimming pool.

582
00:23:26,067 --> 00:23:27,233
It's incredible.

583
00:23:27,900 --> 00:23:29,167
I bet we're playing a game.

584
00:23:29,267 --> 00:23:30,467
Throwing balls.

585
00:23:32,400 --> 00:23:34,267
Gino's swimwear is super short.

586
00:23:35,067 --> 00:23:37,300
Yeah, the kind that
gay people will be totally into.

587
00:23:37,400 --> 00:23:39,567
He likes to be topless.

588
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:41,800
Guan-Yu isn't so bad, either

589
00:23:41,900 --> 00:23:43,733
I thought his body would look like mine.

590
00:23:43,833 --> 00:23:45,533
Like, very skinny.

591
00:23:45,633 --> 00:23:48,367
You know, and I see Bobo's body all the time.

592
00:23:48,467 --> 00:23:49,833
So, I just walk away.

593
00:23:51,133 --> 00:23:52,400
(The coach at Divecube will announce the rules)

594
00:23:52,500 --> 00:23:55,267
Next, the new members will be the captains.

595
00:23:55,367 --> 00:23:58,500
Take turns to pick your member
for the water ball contest.

596
00:23:58,600 --> 00:24:00,767
Those who get three scores first may win.

597
00:24:00,867 --> 00:24:02,433
Best two out of three.

598
00:24:02,533 --> 00:24:04,900
The winner team will receive special reward.

599
00:24:05,267 --> 00:24:06,067
(Waterball Group Contest)

600
00:24:06,167 --> 00:24:07,267
New members.

601
00:24:07,291 --> 00:24:10,291
(Susu and Jia-Hang will be the captains. Take turns picking members for the water ball contest. The winner team will receive a special reward)

602
00:24:10,467 --> 00:24:11,600
Pick me...

603
00:24:11,700 --> 00:24:12,333
Bobo.

604
00:24:16,467 --> 00:24:18,133
Gino.

605
00:24:19,633 --> 00:24:21,033
I want Guan-Yu.

606
00:24:21,133 --> 00:24:22,333
Nio.

607
00:24:23,300 --> 00:24:24,667
Then I want Eri.

608
00:24:27,433 --> 00:24:33,500
(Susu Team/Susu, Bobo, Guan-Yu, Eri)
(Jia-Hang Team/Jia-Hang, Gino, Nio, Shih-Feng)

609
00:24:42,333 --> 00:24:43,900
(Jia-Hang doesn't seem as excited as the others do...)
Greasy.

610
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:45,300
Oh My God.

611
00:24:59,700 --> 00:25:02,833
I think Jia-Hang is on the verge

612
00:25:02,933 --> 00:25:04,800
of having a panic attack.

613
00:25:14,867 --> 00:25:16,733
(Gino and Guan-Yu stay beside Jia-Hang)
Take it slow...

614
00:25:20,067 --> 00:25:21,033
Okay, okay.

615
00:25:21,133 --> 00:25:23,267
- Okay, it's alright.
- It's all good, you're fine.

616
00:25:23,733 --> 00:25:26,567
(Why is Jia-Hang scared of the water?)

617
00:25:26,667 --> 00:25:28,333
Can I not play the game?

618
00:25:28,433 --> 00:25:29,800
Sure, sure you can.

619
00:25:30,567 --> 00:25:32,300
Can I be the goalkeeper?

620
00:25:39,333 --> 00:25:41,567
I'm scared of the swimming pool.

621
00:25:42,600 --> 00:25:46,867
I was bullied at the age of 9.

622
00:25:46,967 --> 00:25:49,467
And, there was this classmate

623
00:25:49,567 --> 00:25:52,500
pushed me into the swimming pool.

624
00:25:52,600 --> 00:25:54,633
He pressed my head into the water.

625
00:25:54,733 --> 00:25:56,533
Next thing I knew, I was drown.

626
00:25:56,633 --> 00:25:59,033
Long after that, I'm sure how long it was

627
00:25:59,133 --> 00:26:00,567
a lifeguard saved me.

628
00:26:03,333 --> 00:26:06,100
After that experience

629
00:26:06,200 --> 00:26:09,200
everything, including the
whole environment and the smell

630
00:26:09,300 --> 00:26:11,667
and the color blue make me nauseous.

631
00:26:12,533 --> 00:26:13,333
I thought after the puking

632
00:26:13,433 --> 00:26:14,900
he wouldn't get in the water again.

633
00:26:15,000 --> 00:26:16,400
It turned out, he still hopped in.

634
00:26:16,500 --> 00:26:19,233
(Jia-Hang chooses to finish the contest with the support of everyone's)
and he even got better.

635
00:26:19,333 --> 00:26:20,400
So he left me this impression

636
00:26:20,500 --> 00:26:23,800
that he cared about the whole team.

637
00:26:24,500 --> 00:26:27,567
(Once the production crew knew about this with the consent of Jia-Hang,
The film crew has asked Gino and Nio

638
00:26:28,067 --> 00:26:30,733
they picked members to keep him safe)
to be near and help me, protect me.

639
00:26:30,833 --> 00:26:32,200
So I'm pretty grateful for that.

640
00:26:32,300 --> 00:26:34,267
Plus, I'm grateful for them too.

641
00:26:34,833 --> 00:26:36,333
He is nice, he is someone

642
00:26:36,433 --> 00:26:37,333
at my first sight

643
00:26:37,433 --> 00:26:39,667
he is very gentle.

644
00:26:39,767 --> 00:26:41,867
He keeps protecting me
when we play the ball.

645
00:26:41,967 --> 00:26:43,100
So, I feel like

646
00:26:43,200 --> 00:26:45,667
he genuinely is someone sweet, yeah.

647
00:26:49,667 --> 00:26:51,400
(Two teams are ready to fight
at the sound of the whistle!)

648
00:26:51,500 --> 00:26:52,533
The game starts now.

649
00:26:52,633 --> 00:26:54,567
(Susu Team/Jia-Hang Team)

650
00:26:54,667 --> 00:26:56,667
(Gino got the ball first...)

651
00:27:02,733 --> 00:27:03,733
Beep.

652
00:27:04,333 --> 00:27:05,333
Out of bounds.

653
00:27:05,633 --> 00:27:06,900
He keeps taking the ball

654
00:27:07,433 --> 00:27:08,433
I'll protect you.

655
00:27:11,533 --> 00:27:12,100
(Eri got the ball!)

656
00:27:12,200 --> 00:27:13,300
Scored!

657
00:27:17,433 --> 00:27:19,967
(Susu team scored!)

658
00:27:22,600 --> 00:27:24,200
(Eri seems to be good at this...)
So dumb.

659
00:27:27,933 --> 00:27:28,733
Eri.

660
00:27:29,467 --> 00:27:32,767
No idea why
I did not see that coming at all.

661
00:27:35,767 --> 00:27:38,033
I didn't know how to play the game.

662
00:27:38,133 --> 00:27:39,233
It was just

663
00:27:39,333 --> 00:27:40,967
I was in the water, anyway.

664
00:27:41,067 --> 00:27:43,033
There was no need to put up a facade.

665
00:27:43,133 --> 00:27:44,233
Take it seriously.

666
00:27:44,333 --> 00:27:46,200
Fun was all that mattered to everyone.

667
00:27:47,767 --> 00:27:48,667
(Bobo tries to score)
Here I come.

668
00:27:52,833 --> 00:27:54,000
(Eri got the ball again...)
Eri.

669
00:27:55,533 --> 00:27:57,600
(Susu team scored!)

670
00:27:57,700 --> 00:28:03,133
- Eri...
- MVP.

671
00:28:04,233 --> 00:28:06,167
I think we're both musicians.

672
00:28:06,267 --> 00:28:07,333
We're all singers.

673
00:28:07,433 --> 00:28:10,767
So we're fully aware of how the contest is.

674
00:28:10,867 --> 00:28:13,700
We gotta put on a game face when the show's on.

675
00:28:13,800 --> 00:28:15,533
After contests, we get to be who we are.

676
00:28:15,633 --> 00:28:18,833
It is an attitude that we share in common.

677
00:28:19,033 --> 00:28:20,833
(Tall Nio also launches an attack)

678
00:28:22,267 --> 00:28:23,267
Go away.

679
00:28:25,267 --> 00:28:27,767
(Nio scored!)

680
00:28:28,800 --> 00:28:31,000
(Nio got the ball and is trying to score again!)

681
00:28:33,567 --> 00:28:34,733
Blue team (Jia-Hang) scored.

682
00:28:35,900 --> 00:28:37,500
It's a tie now.
- MVP.

683
00:28:37,600 --> 00:28:39,667
- MVP.
- The final round.

684
00:28:39,767 --> 00:28:43,533
(Let's win the last score!
The contest is at a white heat)

685
00:28:48,300 --> 00:28:49,367
It was memorable for me

686
00:28:49,467 --> 00:28:50,400
that Bobo scratched Nio

687
00:28:50,500 --> 00:28:52,500
(with scars all over)
Because that scratch went quite deep.

688
00:28:52,600 --> 00:28:55,000
Yeah, I was in shock.

689
00:28:55,100 --> 00:28:57,400
Bobo really went all out and full-on.

690
00:29:00,433 --> 00:29:03,167
(It's hard to avoid physical touches during the contest...)
Why'd you stop me all the time?

691
00:29:05,500 --> 00:29:07,667
Because I have to block two of them.

692
00:29:07,767 --> 00:29:09,200
They always work together.

693
00:29:09,300 --> 00:29:11,333
And our teammates always stay where they are.

694
00:29:11,433 --> 00:29:13,667
There's no way I wouldn't use my force.

695
00:29:19,700 --> 00:29:22,967
(Are those touches intentional or not...?)

696
00:29:23,067 --> 00:29:24,533
Well, I am not a quick swimmer

697
00:29:24,633 --> 00:29:27,000
and I'm not as powerful as Eri.

698
00:29:27,100 --> 00:29:28,667
The only way for me to contribute

699
00:29:28,767 --> 00:29:29,867
is to guard my enemies.

700
00:29:29,967 --> 00:29:31,600
So I just take my enemies away.

701
00:29:36,033 --> 00:29:37,867
I did hug Guan-Yu on purpose

702
00:29:37,967 --> 00:29:39,500
(circling?)
And the rest of them

703
00:29:39,600 --> 00:29:42,433
I hugged them to keep the ball from the gate.

704
00:29:43,267 --> 00:29:44,100
Whose ball is it?

705
00:29:44,200 --> 00:29:46,433
- Ours.
- Are you alright?

706
00:29:47,267 --> 00:29:49,133
(Can this attack get them the score?)

707
00:29:49,900 --> 00:29:51,000
(Eri scored again!)

708
00:29:51,100 --> 00:29:54,700
MVP! MVP!

709
00:29:54,800 --> 00:29:55,967
The game is over.

710
00:29:56,067 --> 00:29:59,833
(The game is over. Give each other a hug!)

711
00:30:03,667 --> 00:30:05,333
(Teammates also thank Jia-Hang's contribution)
It's over.

712
00:30:05,433 --> 00:30:07,733
You did great.

713
00:30:07,833 --> 00:30:08,900
You were amazing.

714
00:30:09,867 --> 00:30:11,333
Lifting her up

715
00:30:12,533 --> 00:30:14,067
I've got muscle cramps on my legs

716
00:30:14,167 --> 00:30:15,933
but I didn't tell anyone.

717
00:30:16,033 --> 00:30:17,400
Susu is the closest one to me.

718
00:30:17,500 --> 00:30:19,167
Besides, he's strong

719
00:30:19,267 --> 00:30:20,533
I thought he could lift me up.

720
00:30:20,667 --> 00:30:22,633
The winner is the Orange team (Susu)

721
00:30:22,733 --> 00:30:25,167
(Susu team won the game!)

722
00:30:25,267 --> 00:30:27,867
The winning team
would have a special reward later.

723
00:30:27,967 --> 00:30:30,233
Next, we're moving on to the individual contest.

724
00:30:30,333 --> 00:30:33,267
(After the group contest was over it's time for the most important game...)
Please follow the grouping on the chart for individual matches.

725
00:30:33,367 --> 00:30:35,000
You've got 30 seconds.

726
00:30:35,100 --> 00:30:37,533
(Waterball individual contest/One-on-one water ball contest. Whoever gets the ball after 30 seconds wins. ) The final one with the ball in hands wins.

727
00:30:37,633 --> 00:30:40,767
(The rankings will decide who gets to choose his roommate first)
The winner gets to pick his own roommate.

728
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:44,300
Alright, the first group is me and Jia-Hang.

729
00:30:44,400 --> 00:30:45,800
Don't bully him.

730
00:30:49,100 --> 00:30:50,700
(The contest will proceed based on this chart)

731
00:30:50,800 --> 00:30:52,200
Would you like to concede defeat already?

732
00:30:53,500 --> 00:30:54,733
Fight for life.

733
00:30:55,367 --> 00:30:56,700
The game starts now.

734
00:30:58,067 --> 00:31:00,633
(First group, Eri Vs. Jia-Hang)
Eri...

735
00:31:02,700 --> 00:31:04,567
Go get it...

736
00:31:04,667 --> 00:31:05,767
What does that mean?

737
00:31:05,867 --> 00:31:06,433
What should I do?

738
00:31:06,533 --> 00:31:08,067
Take it, you keep it.

739
00:31:08,167 --> 00:31:10,000
Do you want to snatch it?

740
00:31:10,100 --> 00:31:12,000
I'll do whatever I want.

741
00:31:14,533 --> 00:31:15,367
Based on what I've observed

742
00:31:15,467 --> 00:31:17,100
I'm not completely certain yet.

743
00:31:17,200 --> 00:31:19,833
Some people have already
started liking each other mutually

744
00:31:19,933 --> 00:31:22,567
or some has already fallen for someone.

745
00:31:22,667 --> 00:31:27,033
(Eri won the first fight)
By the way competitiveness is just not in me.

746
00:31:27,133 --> 00:31:27,900
So I feel like

747
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:30,667
currently I don't have that much strength left

748
00:31:30,767 --> 00:31:31,933
to play the game.

749
00:31:32,067 --> 00:31:36,233
The second group would be Guan-Yu and Shih-Feng.

750
00:31:37,167 --> 00:31:38,267
(Second group, Guan-Yu Vs. Shih-Feng)

751
00:31:39,800 --> 00:31:41,033
Go, Guan-Yu.

752
00:31:44,133 --> 00:31:46,667
I started to get a little nervous.

753
00:31:46,767 --> 00:31:49,833
The moemnt I realized that we were able to see

754
00:31:49,933 --> 00:31:51,600
who had a crush on whom

755
00:31:51,700 --> 00:31:53,433
while playing this game.

756
00:31:53,600 --> 00:31:55,033
(It was a tie. Now's the 10-second overtime...)
Alright, overtime for 10 seconds

757
00:31:57,400 --> 00:32:05,100
9 8 7 6 5 4 3 2 1

758
00:32:05,200 --> 00:32:07,967
(Shih-Feng won the second fight)

759
00:32:10,967 --> 00:32:12,867
It's Susu and Nio.

760
00:32:14,933 --> 00:32:16,400
(Third group, Susu Vs. Nio)

761
00:32:16,500 --> 00:32:19,733
(Both are over 6 feet tall.
This is a fight about height...)

762
00:32:22,400 --> 00:32:24,000
My waist was injured, seriously.

763
00:32:24,100 --> 00:32:25,433
Personally, I was like.

764
00:32:25,533 --> 00:32:27,000
Let it go. Just let him win.

765
00:32:27,100 --> 00:32:29,133
There was no way for me

766
00:32:29,233 --> 00:32:30,233
to keep it up with him.

767
00:32:30,333 --> 00:32:34,467
(Nio won the third fight)
He probably was very eager

768
00:32:34,567 --> 00:32:36,067
to be in the driving seat.

769
00:32:36,167 --> 00:32:36,933
Something like that.

770
00:32:37,033 --> 00:32:38,400
Gino and Bobo.

771
00:32:40,667 --> 00:32:41,267
Game's on.

772
00:32:41,367 --> 00:32:43,367
(Fourth group, Gino Vs. Bobo)
My swimsuit is tiny. Don't pull it.

773
00:32:43,467 --> 00:32:44,567
Pull it.

774
00:32:44,767 --> 00:32:46,233
(The tension is delicate between those two...)

775
00:32:46,333 --> 00:32:47,533
Take it off...

776
00:32:51,000 --> 00:32:52,133
Only 10 seconds left.

777
00:32:53,500 --> 00:32:59,900
(Bobo doesn't seem like competing with Gino...)
10 9 8 7 6 5 4.

778
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:01,667
My energy is already running low.

779
00:33:01,767 --> 00:33:02,767
(Gino won the fourth fight)
I've already had no desire to continue

780
00:33:02,867 --> 00:33:04,567
and now my opponent is Gino

781
00:33:04,667 --> 00:33:05,767
I'm like

782
00:33:05,867 --> 00:33:08,933
the game will go on forever
if I take this seriously.

783
00:33:09,033 --> 00:33:11,100
Forget it, just let him win.

784
00:33:11,200 --> 00:33:11,967
If I really do win

785
00:33:12,067 --> 00:33:13,933
I'd like to pick him as my roommate.

786
00:33:14,033 --> 00:33:15,867
And I'd like to know if he wins

787
00:33:15,967 --> 00:33:17,667
who he'd choose.

788
00:33:19,067 --> 00:33:21,500
(Bobo told the truth all of a sudden...)
Because the one I'd like to pick is my opponent.

789
00:33:21,767 --> 00:33:22,433
Yeah

790
00:33:22,533 --> 00:33:24,000
(startled)

791
00:33:26,200 --> 00:33:27,567
Well, then

792
00:33:27,667 --> 00:33:30,167
I'm feeling shy and I'm blushing.

793
00:33:30,267 --> 00:33:32,300
But I do have to say

794
00:33:32,400 --> 00:33:34,500
my feelings for Bobo are increasing.

795
00:33:35,200 --> 00:33:39,600
He is quite sweet to me, to be honest.

796
00:33:40,100 --> 00:33:42,167
It's incredible. I'm happy for him.

797
00:33:42,267 --> 00:33:44,700
Whatever Gino responds to him

798
00:33:44,800 --> 00:33:47,733
at least he did something that the only thing

799
00:33:47,833 --> 00:33:49,733
he should do during those six days.

800
00:33:49,833 --> 00:33:51,900
He did it on the third day

801
00:33:52,000 --> 00:33:54,067
I think he's amazing, yeah.

802
00:33:54,767 --> 00:33:55,833
(It's time for the final)
Game's on.

803
00:34:10,433 --> 00:34:11,567
Only 10 seconds left

804
00:34:13,900 --> 00:34:16,700
3 2 1

805
00:34:20,400 --> 00:34:21,567
(The championship, Shih-Feng Vs. Nio)
The game starts now.

806
00:34:28,233 --> 00:34:31,367
I'm pretty chill for the most of the time.

807
00:34:31,467 --> 00:34:32,733
What surprises me

808
00:34:32,833 --> 00:34:35,733
is that I have this competitiveness

809
00:34:35,833 --> 00:34:37,833
when I perform

810
00:34:38,667 --> 00:34:40,900
9 8 7

811
00:34:41,000 --> 00:34:42,400
Poor Shih-Feng

812
00:34:42,500 --> 00:34:47,533
5 4 3 2 1

813
00:34:49,000 --> 00:34:50,433
(Nio is the winner of this individual contest!)
Shih-Feng.

814
00:34:53,367 --> 00:34:55,000
Individual contest result announcement.

815
00:34:55,100 --> 00:34:56,867
Four place goes to Gino.

816
00:34:57,800 --> 00:34:58,633
(Slipping down)

817
00:35:00,967 --> 00:35:02,233
Thought there were rewards

818
00:35:02,333 --> 00:35:03,133
(pleased)

819
00:35:03,233 --> 00:35:04,467
The third goes to Eri.

820
00:35:07,033 --> 00:35:08,433
The second goes to Shih-Feng.

821
00:35:10,500 --> 00:35:12,033
Stop doing that.

822
00:35:12,133 --> 00:35:13,433
The first place goes to Nio.

823
00:35:13,633 --> 00:35:16,367
(The injured water ball winner)

824
00:35:17,000 --> 00:35:21,267
(Choose your roommate based on the ranking)

825
00:35:21,700 --> 00:35:23,400
(What is Nio gonna choose...?)

826
00:35:23,500 --> 00:35:24,700
Sorry, Guan-Yu.

827
00:35:24,800 --> 00:35:26,367
You'll have to share the bed with me again.

828
00:35:26,467 --> 00:35:29,333
(Nio and Guan-Yu become roommates)

829
00:35:34,000 --> 00:35:35,033
Then I chose Gino.

830
00:35:35,133 --> 00:35:36,800
(Shih-Feng and Gino become roommates)
Keep sleeping with me.

831
00:35:36,900 --> 00:35:38,567
It was like the old times.

832
00:35:41,333 --> 00:35:43,433
Who wants to sleep with me
Rasie your hand.

833
00:35:43,533 --> 00:35:44,267
Me.

834
00:35:44,367 --> 00:35:45,567
Woah.

835
00:35:46,567 --> 00:35:47,433
Everyone wants it.

836
00:35:47,533 --> 00:35:48,600
Well, let's share a room.

837
00:35:48,700 --> 00:35:51,233
(Eri and Bobo are roommates again)

838
00:35:52,600 --> 00:35:54,833
- The camera crew is speechless.
- Exactly the same.

839
00:35:54,933 --> 00:35:56,367
(It is similar to the previous arrangement...)
The crew is speechless.

840
00:35:56,467 --> 00:35:57,133
You guys think it's no fun, don't you?

841
00:35:57,233 --> 00:35:58,433
What a terrible show.

842
00:35:58,600 --> 00:36:01,033
(Susu and Jia-Hang remain roommates)

843
00:36:06,033 --> 00:36:08,333
Next, here's the winner team announcement.

844
00:36:08,433 --> 00:36:12,067
The team gets to choose the shower rooms.

845
00:36:12,167 --> 00:36:14,167
Then do you want to choose the one with a door

846
00:36:14,267 --> 00:36:16,000
or the one without a door?

847
00:36:16,100 --> 00:36:17,033
(The winning team gets to choose the shower room)
How about we choose the one with a door

848
00:36:17,133 --> 00:36:18,267
so they can shower together.

849
00:36:18,767 --> 00:36:20,667
Alright, the one with a door it is.

850
00:36:26,033 --> 00:36:28,600
(Showering in the room without a door is somehow sheepish...)
I'm really used to being in front of the camera.

851
00:36:28,700 --> 00:36:30,733
Showering in front of a camera

852
00:36:30,833 --> 00:36:32,467
for me is more like.

853
00:36:32,767 --> 00:36:34,267
"Is it a good angle to film me showering?"

854
00:36:34,367 --> 00:36:36,733
Or, should I pose like this at this angle?

855
00:36:36,833 --> 00:36:37,367
Something like this.

856
00:36:37,467 --> 00:36:39,867
My mind wanders to the details
I normally don't pay attention to.

857
00:36:45,300 --> 00:36:48,500
(Let's get some protein drinks
after a relaxing workout!)

858
00:36:50,333 --> 00:36:51,167
Where are you going?

859
00:36:51,267 --> 00:36:52,000
Cheers

860
00:36:53,833 --> 00:36:55,267
(cheers!)

861
00:37:07,133 --> 00:37:07,800
Everyone's ready.

862
00:37:07,900 --> 00:37:08,400
Let's go.

863
00:37:08,500 --> 00:37:10,033
Don't leave your stuff here.

864
00:37:23,100 --> 00:37:24,500
Bye

865
00:37:27,033 --> 00:37:29,333
(on the bus back to the cabin...)

866
00:37:29,433 --> 00:37:30,833
You said you have a crush, right?

867
00:37:30,933 --> 00:37:33,800
No, I said I wanted to give
and I didn't want to choose.

868
00:37:33,900 --> 00:37:34,433
You didn't want to choose?

869
00:37:34,533 --> 00:37:35,467
Why is that?

870
00:37:35,567 --> 00:37:37,633
From the dating perspective
what does that mean?

871
00:37:37,733 --> 00:37:39,800
I've already given up.

872
00:37:40,400 --> 00:37:41,367
You mean now?

873
00:37:41,467 --> 00:37:41,967
No, I feel like

874
00:37:42,067 --> 00:37:43,500
I'm ready to go home.

875
00:37:45,567 --> 00:37:48,433
Shame on you.

876
00:37:49,333 --> 00:37:51,933
May I ask, do you want to get picked
by someone else?

877
00:37:52,033 --> 00:37:53,167
I'm fine either way.

878
00:37:53,267 --> 00:37:55,800
(They start to talk about choosing roommates...)
If you have a chance to be number one.

879
00:37:55,900 --> 00:37:57,733
- Yeah.
- Let's go on a date, let's go.

880
00:37:57,833 --> 00:37:59,600
- Alright, come on.
- You guys haven't dated?

881
00:37:59,700 --> 00:38:00,467
No, never been on a date.

882
00:38:00,567 --> 00:38:02,233
But I didn't seem to notice him at all.

883
00:38:03,100 --> 00:38:04,200
He shook his chest at the camera

884
00:38:04,300 --> 00:38:06,033
and I said, "Disgusting."

885
00:38:06,167 --> 00:38:07,667
So gross.

886
00:38:08,167 --> 00:38:09,833
You clearly like it.

887
00:38:10,133 --> 00:38:10,567
No.

888
00:38:10,667 --> 00:38:11,200
You clearly do

889
00:38:11,300 --> 00:38:13,500
I'm not really into pecs.

890
00:38:13,600 --> 00:38:15,467
So what muscles do you like?

891
00:38:16,800 --> 00:38:18,033
Probably roast chicken.

892
00:38:18,133 --> 00:38:19,267
Roast chicken.

893
00:38:19,367 --> 00:38:20,100
The one from yesterday.

894
00:38:20,200 --> 00:38:21,733
Yeah, they tasted great.

895
00:38:23,233 --> 00:38:24,800
Then may I ask, why'd you...

896
00:38:24,900 --> 00:38:25,567
Yeah, sure you can.

897
00:38:25,667 --> 00:38:26,600
Why did you choose Guan-Yu

898
00:38:26,700 --> 00:38:28,000
I'm used to sharing a bed with him.

899
00:38:28,100 --> 00:38:29,000
(Nio got used to sleeping with Guan-Yu so he chose him)
Beside, sleeping together

900
00:38:29,100 --> 00:38:31,633
for me, is a pretty important.

901
00:38:31,733 --> 00:38:32,300
Mentally, I think.

902
00:38:32,400 --> 00:38:35,100
Since I'd like to sleep
in a bed that's familiar to me...

903
00:38:35,200 --> 00:38:37,233
(complaining it secretly)
I don't want to talk anymore.

904
00:38:37,900 --> 00:38:39,067
It looks great.

905
00:38:39,167 --> 00:38:40,967
Did you say I look great in this?

906
00:38:41,733 --> 00:38:42,967
Stop bickering.

907
00:38:44,133 --> 00:38:46,467
I guess I cared who he chose to sleep with.

908
00:38:46,567 --> 00:38:49,200
The truth is,
I didn't want to share a bed with him

909
00:38:49,300 --> 00:38:51,333
I wouldn't want to get too exposed

910
00:38:51,433 --> 00:38:53,900
in front of him.

911
00:38:54,200 --> 00:38:56,367
If you're number one

912
00:38:56,467 --> 00:38:58,800
who would you choose?

913
00:38:58,900 --> 00:39:00,367
I'd probably choose Guan-Yu.

914
00:39:00,467 --> 00:39:02,133
(If Susu is the winner, he chooses Guan-Yu as his roommate...)
The reason is that.

915
00:39:03,833 --> 00:39:06,967
Well, during our first date.

916
00:39:07,533 --> 00:39:09,700
During the date, he talked to me

917
00:39:09,800 --> 00:39:12,200
about his sleeping situations.

918
00:39:12,300 --> 00:39:14,867
You know, I make noise and he makes noise.

919
00:39:15,500 --> 00:39:17,533
No, of course, I'm very pleased

920
00:39:17,633 --> 00:39:20,633
that someone wants to get to know me.

921
00:39:20,733 --> 00:39:21,967
For sure, it also comes with some pressure.

922
00:39:22,067 --> 00:39:24,000
People chose you, and...

923
00:39:24,100 --> 00:39:26,100
I feel like I have to reward them
with something.

924
00:39:26,200 --> 00:39:29,567
Yeah, but I haven't seemed to

925
00:39:29,667 --> 00:39:31,367
come up with a response to them.

926
00:39:31,467 --> 00:39:33,000
(Someone couldn't get to sleep
on the way back...)

927
00:39:33,100 --> 00:39:35,367
Ever since Susu joined us

928
00:39:35,467 --> 00:39:37,167
I couldn't get much sleep the whole way

929
00:39:37,267 --> 00:39:38,833
I didn't exactly know why.

930
00:39:38,933 --> 00:39:41,033
Overthinking I guess, couldn't really sleep

931
00:39:41,133 --> 00:39:43,867
I kept watching him sleeping.

932
00:39:43,967 --> 00:39:45,300
(He is thinking about Susu and Guan-Yu and he can't sleep...)
and then Susu. "Oh, Susu is asleep".

933
00:39:45,400 --> 00:39:47,767
And I kept watching Guan-Yu
I just couldn't doze off.

934
00:39:47,867 --> 00:39:49,633
Sleepiness didn't hit at all the whole way.

935
00:40:03,867 --> 00:40:06,167
(Reindeer Herb House)

936
00:40:06,633 --> 00:40:10,567
(Double Room/Susu, Jia-Hang)

937
00:40:14,800 --> 00:40:16,067
Your shirt looks great.

938
00:40:16,167 --> 00:40:17,000
This one?

939
00:40:17,433 --> 00:40:19,800
Are your clothes really fancy this evening?

940
00:40:19,900 --> 00:40:21,533
No, mine is not what I wear tonight

941
00:40:21,633 --> 00:40:24,067
is just a casual shirt.

942
00:40:25,367 --> 00:40:26,533
This one.

943
00:40:27,900 --> 00:40:28,767
(Everyone seems to be getting ready for something...)
It looks perfect.

944
00:40:28,867 --> 00:40:30,567
It really does. It suits you.

945
00:40:31,500 --> 00:40:34,400
(Double Room/Eri, Bobo)
I'm curious about everyone's outfit.

946
00:40:35,100 --> 00:40:37,100
Would they be similar to mine?

947
00:40:41,433 --> 00:40:42,967
(checking)

948
00:40:43,467 --> 00:40:45,067
(satisfied)

949
00:40:45,167 --> 00:40:47,433
Is this too much?

950
00:40:47,533 --> 00:40:49,500
Not at all, I think it looks good.

951
00:40:49,600 --> 00:40:50,500
Our plan for today

952
00:40:50,600 --> 00:40:52,667
actually worked a little

953
00:40:52,767 --> 00:40:54,133
I think it worked.

954
00:40:54,233 --> 00:40:55,633
Two calculated people.

955
00:40:56,567 --> 00:40:57,967
But that was it.

956
00:40:58,067 --> 00:40:59,467
Yeah, it didn't work much

957
00:40:59,567 --> 00:41:00,167
I'd better tuck this in.

958
00:41:00,267 --> 00:41:01,667
(Quadruple Room Nio, Guan-Yu, Gino, Sh-Fung)
I think it'll look better.

959
00:41:02,100 --> 00:41:03,633
It'll make you look taller

960
00:41:07,533 --> 00:41:08,867
(all of a sudden)
Here, let me do that

961
00:41:10,833 --> 00:41:11,500
(staring)

962
00:41:12,133 --> 00:41:13,000
Come on, I'll help you

963
00:41:13,100 --> 00:41:15,967
(a gesture that is somehow sweet)
Mom is helping her kids dress

964
00:41:17,000 --> 00:41:17,933
(rushing)(showing up out of nowhere)
I'll help you

965
00:41:18,033 --> 00:41:19,467
I'm wearing a brief

966
00:41:19,567 --> 00:41:21,067
and you just zipped it open.

967
00:41:21,167 --> 00:41:23,033
Did someone bring a belt?

968
00:41:23,133 --> 00:41:25,467
(Shih-Feng seems to be very calm about this...)
I have belts, do you want one?

969
00:41:25,567 --> 00:41:26,267
I'm wearing a brief

970
00:41:26,367 --> 00:41:27,767
and you just popped it open.

971
00:41:29,200 --> 00:41:30,467
Do you want it?

972
00:41:30,567 --> 00:41:32,133
(Now, belts don't matter anymore...)
Okay, I'll swing by later.

973
00:41:32,533 --> 00:41:33,633
Ouch.

974
00:41:33,733 --> 00:41:35,700
(Shih-Feng couldn't resist that emotion...)
What's wrong?

975
00:41:35,800 --> 00:41:38,633
(feeling shy and falling down)
They two kept being...

976
00:41:38,733 --> 00:41:40,733
What? Tell me.

977
00:41:40,833 --> 00:41:41,700
Just tell me.

978
00:41:41,800 --> 00:41:43,300
They both kept doing that

979
00:41:43,400 --> 00:41:45,933
(recreating the scene)
They've already, like this.

980
00:41:49,267 --> 00:41:51,333
It's hard to zip it up, way to huge.

981
00:41:53,600 --> 00:41:54,967
Ridiculous.

982
00:41:55,067 --> 00:41:56,133
Now you know.

983
00:41:57,733 --> 00:41:58,700
(Double Room/Eri, Bobo)
When he picked Guan-Yu today

984
00:41:58,800 --> 00:42:01,133
I was a little upset, to be honest.

985
00:42:01,767 --> 00:42:02,467
Actually

986
00:42:02,567 --> 00:42:03,500
I didn't know the reason

987
00:42:03,600 --> 00:42:05,067
I was shocked that he picked him.

988
00:42:05,167 --> 00:42:05,767
How come it was him?

989
00:42:05,867 --> 00:42:06,967
(Bobo was shocked about Nio's choice...)
Is he interested in Guan-Yu?

990
00:42:07,067 --> 00:42:09,133
- And then he said.
- I didn't think that was the case.

991
00:42:09,233 --> 00:42:12,200
He just wanted to keep sharing the bed.

992
00:42:13,967 --> 00:42:15,867
That's why I picked you

993
00:42:15,967 --> 00:42:17,167
so I don't have to spend time

994
00:42:17,267 --> 00:42:18,733
to get to know someone.

995
00:42:20,067 --> 00:42:21,200
Let me tell you something

996
00:42:21,300 --> 00:42:23,367
in the beginning, the reason why

997
00:42:23,467 --> 00:42:25,200
I thought he might be interested in me.

998
00:42:25,300 --> 00:42:26,400
Who?

999
00:42:26,500 --> 00:42:27,233
Gino.

1000
00:42:27,333 --> 00:42:28,600
You said Gino is interested in me?

1001
00:42:28,700 --> 00:42:29,933
In me.

1002
00:42:30,033 --> 00:42:32,267
When we were on the bus.

1003
00:42:32,367 --> 00:42:35,033
Basically, we wouldn't touch one another.

1004
00:42:35,133 --> 00:42:35,900
Yeah.

1005
00:42:36,000 --> 00:42:38,567
(Bobo and Gino had physical touches on the bus...)
But he stayed really close to me on the bus.

1006
00:42:39,833 --> 00:42:41,300
The legs and hands.

1007
00:42:42,867 --> 00:42:45,033
He'd probably think of you as Guan

1008
00:42:45,133 --> 00:42:46,200
I think so.

1009
00:42:47,833 --> 00:42:50,533
So I thought I might just overthink
the whole situation

1010
00:42:50,633 --> 00:42:52,900
I'm gonna punch you
your face looks very beatable.

1011
00:42:53,000 --> 00:42:57,767
(Quadruple Room/Nio, Guan-Yu, Gino, Sh-Fung)

1012
00:42:58,633 --> 00:43:00,067
(everyone is busy dressing up...)
Alright.

1013
00:43:00,167 --> 00:43:01,233
Good boy.

1014
00:43:05,433 --> 00:43:06,467
It looks great.

1015
00:43:06,567 --> 00:43:08,467
Really? With a hat on?

1016
00:43:08,567 --> 00:43:09,600
The hat looks great.

1017
00:43:09,700 --> 00:43:11,700
(Helping each other with the looks
Finding what's their best look!)

1018
00:43:11,800 --> 00:43:13,800
It looks so much better.

1019
00:43:21,767 --> 00:43:22,667
(He expresses his affection after coming back from the pool...)
What?

1020
00:43:30,033 --> 00:43:31,167
- What?
- Nothing.

1021
00:43:31,267 --> 00:43:32,033
What are you looking at?

1022
00:43:32,133 --> 00:43:33,033
Nothing.

1023
00:43:36,767 --> 00:43:40,567
(This dinner seems particularly fancy...)

1024
00:43:41,267 --> 00:43:44,167
(with nine chair...)

1025
00:43:45,900 --> 00:43:47,200
Who will it be?

1026
00:43:51,867 --> 00:43:54,533
(One mysterious guest in white
is waiting for everyone...)

1027
00:43:56,533 --> 00:43:58,600
(Who makes them scream like this...?)

1028
00:43:58,700 --> 00:44:00,333
Oh, my gosh.

1029
00:44:00,600 --> 00:44:02,233
(Let's welcome Abao!)
Welcome to my village

1030
00:44:03,133 --> 00:44:04,767
I've got goosebumps.

1031
00:44:05,300 --> 00:44:06,867
You really are my mentor

1032
00:44:06,967 --> 00:44:10,233
in terms of accepting my identity.

1033
00:44:10,333 --> 00:44:11,533
(At this dinner, everyone tells their personal stories)
My family knows about me.

1034
00:44:11,633 --> 00:44:12,667
However.

1035
00:44:12,767 --> 00:44:15,467
They have no desire to get to know me more

1036
00:44:15,567 --> 00:44:17,033
and understand what happened.

1037
00:44:19,000 --> 00:44:21,267
I feel like I just want my parents

1038
00:44:21,367 --> 00:44:22,533
to know me better.

1039
00:44:22,633 --> 00:44:24,133
That's why I chose to tell them.

1040
00:44:24,233 --> 00:44:26,267
You are amazing. It's not easy doing this.

1041
00:44:27,800 --> 00:44:28,967
Let's do it together.

1042
00:44:29,067 --> 00:44:29,867
Oh my god.

1043
00:44:29,967 --> 00:44:31,967
(Plus, something more shocking is about to happen...)
Someone will leave the cabin tomorrow night.

1044
00:44:32,067 --> 00:44:34,333
Please grab the chance to date
this noon

1045
00:44:34,433 --> 00:44:36,867
I said no more than three sentences today.

1046
00:44:37,600 --> 00:44:39,633
Thank you, guys. Let's...

1047
00:44:39,733 --> 00:44:42,600
This is giving me a werewolf vibe.

1048
00:44:44,200 --> 00:44:46,533
(Would the fact that someone is leaving
affect the current situation...)

1049
00:44:46,633 --> 00:44:48,000
Just wanting to be with everyone else.

1050
00:44:49,133 --> 00:44:50,900
I just want to spend time with you guys
