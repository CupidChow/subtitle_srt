1
00:01:02,062 --> 00:01:06,107
<i>Everyone says our love is impossible.</i>

2
00:01:07,942 --> 00:01:12,989
<i>But do you know that since the day</i>
<i>I first saw you…</i>

3
00:01:18,578 --> 00:01:20,455
<i>I knew it wasn't a coincidence?</i>

4
00:01:22,040 --> 00:01:24,042
Hey, are you okay?

5
00:01:24,125 --> 00:01:26,669
<i>But fate was already determined.</i>

6
00:01:28,213 --> 00:01:32,008
<i>I knew right away that we were</i>
<i>meant to be together.</i>

7
00:01:39,265 --> 00:01:41,392
<i>Every time I look at you,</i>

8
00:01:42,101 --> 00:01:44,312
<i>I see the most beautiful thing.</i>

9
00:01:49,442 --> 00:01:53,571
<i>I can't help but feel like</i>
<i>I'm the luckiest man in the world.</i>

10
00:01:54,447 --> 00:01:55,490
Yes.

11
00:01:59,035 --> 00:02:02,330
<i>We're going to complete each other.</i>

12
00:02:11,798 --> 00:02:13,716
<i>I made a promise to myself that</i>

13
00:02:14,926 --> 00:02:18,721
<i>I will do everything to make you</i>
<i>the happiest woman alive.</i>

14
00:02:27,939 --> 00:02:32,485
<i>We'll go through thick and thin together.</i>

15
00:02:36,531 --> 00:02:37,907
<i>Until…</i>

16
00:02:39,826 --> 00:02:41,661
<i>the day you lost consciousness.</i>

17
00:02:42,162 --> 00:02:43,746
<i>You slept for a long time.</i>

18
00:02:43,830 --> 00:02:46,166
<i>Everyone told me to let go and move on.</i>

19
00:02:48,001 --> 00:02:50,003
<i>But I believe in miracles.</i>

20
00:02:51,546 --> 00:02:55,341
<i>Because to me,</i>
<i>you will always be by my side.</i>

21
00:02:56,634 --> 00:02:58,845
<i>In every breath I take.</i>

22
00:03:03,391 --> 00:03:05,476
<i>Even when you stopped breathing.</i>

23
00:03:06,019 --> 00:03:08,146
<i>I will always be beside you.</i>

24
00:03:10,773 --> 00:03:13,151
Lunthom. Lunthom.

25
00:03:13,985 --> 00:03:16,446
<i>Nothing will tear us apart.</i>

26
00:03:17,322 --> 00:03:18,573
<i>Not even death.</i>

27
00:03:21,242 --> 00:03:27,373
<i>And I will love you until my last breath.</i>

28
00:04:35,692 --> 00:04:38,027
<i>Mom, I've sent the money.</i>

29
00:04:38,569 --> 00:04:41,030
<i>Quickly pay the mortgage</i>
<i>before they take the house.</i>

30
00:04:41,114 --> 00:04:43,866
<i>And what about you? Do you have enough?</i>

31
00:04:43,950 --> 00:04:46,828
<i>I do, don't worry about me.</i>

32
00:04:46,911 --> 00:04:50,623
<i>And when are you going to</i>
<i>introduce me to your boyfriend?</i>

33
00:04:50,707 --> 00:04:54,168
<i>Everyone wants to meet the Bangkok boy.</i>

34
00:04:55,753 --> 00:04:57,088
<i>He's busy.</i>

35
00:04:57,171 --> 00:04:59,924
<i>Then introduce him to me quickly.</i>

36
00:05:00,008 --> 00:05:01,634
<i>So we can talk about the wedding.</i>

37
00:05:03,177 --> 00:05:06,973
<i>People are just going to gossip more,</i>
<i>the longer you live together like that.</i>

38
00:05:09,267 --> 00:05:12,895
I know. Later, Mom. I'll call you soon.

39
00:05:16,566 --> 00:05:18,985
BANGKOK 1991

40
00:05:31,622 --> 00:05:34,459
Hey, come on, why aren't you dancing?

41
00:05:35,084 --> 00:05:36,794
Took, just keep on dancing.

42
00:05:36,878 --> 00:05:39,380
Um, Ros. How did your boss die?

43
00:05:39,464 --> 00:05:40,298
Uh…

44
00:05:41,716 --> 00:05:44,218
I don't know. A health issue, I guess.

45
00:05:45,511 --> 00:05:46,804
Such a pity.

46
00:05:46,888 --> 00:05:50,266
She died before she could use
all that money of hers.

47
00:05:51,350 --> 00:05:53,102
Be careful, Ros.

48
00:05:53,186 --> 00:05:55,980
If all you do is work
and never make time for your friends,

49
00:05:56,064 --> 00:05:58,733
- you'll die before enjoying that money.
- True.

50
00:05:58,816 --> 00:06:01,152
- Are you cursing me, Ning?
- Yep.

51
00:06:04,197 --> 00:06:05,198
Hello, beautiful.

52
00:06:06,783 --> 00:06:08,159
Did you come alone?

53
00:06:08,242 --> 00:06:11,829
There's three of us.
And we don't have any drinks either.

54
00:06:11,913 --> 00:06:13,748
You don't have any drinks?

55
00:06:14,415 --> 00:06:16,125
Don't you have any coupons?

56
00:06:25,718 --> 00:06:27,678
Look at her expression.

57
00:06:27,762 --> 00:06:31,557
Good-looking, but unfortunately broke.

58
00:06:31,641 --> 00:06:33,226
Comfort your friend, will ya?

59
00:06:34,310 --> 00:06:35,812
I knew it.

60
00:07:15,518 --> 00:07:16,436
Hey, Ros.

61
00:07:16,519 --> 00:07:17,353
Ros!

62
00:07:17,854 --> 00:07:18,688
Are you okay?

63
00:07:19,272 --> 00:07:20,648
Are you already drunk?

64
00:07:25,027 --> 00:07:26,195
For sure.

65
00:07:28,030 --> 00:07:29,073
Are you okay?

66
00:07:29,157 --> 00:07:30,950
- I need to go to the toilet.
- Sure.

67
00:08:50,404 --> 00:08:51,405
Cheev.

68
00:08:52,740 --> 00:08:54,367
Oh, Ros. You're already up?

69
00:08:54,450 --> 00:08:55,952
Want some fried dough?

70
00:08:58,538 --> 00:09:00,164
Ros, is something wrong?

71
00:09:00,831 --> 00:09:03,584
Why does it look like you're going to cry?

72
00:09:06,379 --> 00:09:10,716
This is the first time
I woke up to see you.

73
00:09:12,176 --> 00:09:15,054
From now on, it'll be just the two of us.

74
00:09:22,186 --> 00:09:26,065
My mom really wants to meet you.
Let's find a day to visit her.

75
00:09:27,608 --> 00:09:30,319
Could it be after the funeral?

76
00:09:37,493 --> 00:09:39,870
Ros…

77
00:09:46,544 --> 00:09:47,712
Ros, sweetie.

78
00:09:50,172 --> 00:09:52,717
And I'll ask your hand in marriage
from her, okay?

79
00:09:56,345 --> 00:09:57,680
You're the one who said it.

80
00:09:59,056 --> 00:10:00,725
Go pack your bags.

81
00:10:01,934 --> 00:10:02,810
Why?

82
00:10:04,145 --> 00:10:06,063
I want to take you somewhere.

83
00:10:07,064 --> 00:10:07,982
Where?

84
00:10:08,774 --> 00:10:10,318
I can't tell you just yet.

85
00:10:14,322 --> 00:10:15,656
Sure.

86
00:10:25,499 --> 00:10:27,627
Cheev, why are we here?

87
00:10:28,419 --> 00:10:30,212
I need to collect some things.

88
00:10:30,296 --> 00:10:31,714
Wait here, will you?

89
00:10:31,797 --> 00:10:32,882
Okay.

90
00:11:20,388 --> 00:11:21,514
Thanks.

91
00:11:51,460 --> 00:11:52,336
Hello.

92
00:11:57,800 --> 00:11:58,926
What are you doing?

93
00:12:22,116 --> 00:12:24,577
It looks like it's going to rain
for a long while.

94
00:12:25,619 --> 00:12:28,205
Let's wait for the rain to stop
before heading back.

95
00:12:29,081 --> 00:12:30,291
And what's your name?

96
00:12:32,293 --> 00:12:33,586
Rossukhon.

97
00:12:34,462 --> 00:12:36,088
You can call me Ros.

98
00:12:39,842 --> 00:12:40,885
I'm Cheev.

99
00:12:44,930 --> 00:12:46,140
I know.

100
00:12:51,353 --> 00:12:52,605
Are these the documents?

101
00:12:54,398 --> 00:12:56,442
These documents were left by Lunthom.

102
00:12:57,401 --> 00:12:59,028
Follow the agreement.

103
00:12:59,945 --> 00:13:01,697
Mr. Cheev, please review them first.

104
00:13:01,780 --> 00:13:04,700
If there's anything unclear,
don't hesitate to ask.

105
00:13:34,438 --> 00:13:35,856
Cheev…

106
00:13:35,940 --> 00:13:36,941
Yes?

107
00:13:37,024 --> 00:13:38,150
Are you okay?

108
00:13:38,859 --> 00:13:41,362
It's nothing.
I've already sorted everything out.

109
00:13:42,196 --> 00:13:44,198
- You sure?
- I'm sure.

110
00:13:45,449 --> 00:13:46,367
Let's go on a trip.

111
00:13:47,493 --> 00:13:48,327
Sure.

112
00:14:00,172 --> 00:14:01,549
Cheev…

113
00:14:01,632 --> 00:14:02,841
Yes?

114
00:14:02,925 --> 00:14:04,885
Where are we going?

115
00:14:06,554 --> 00:14:07,972
Where are we going?

116
00:14:10,015 --> 00:14:11,642
I'm taking you someplace

117
00:14:12,768 --> 00:14:15,437
where we don't have to care
what others think.

118
00:14:18,649 --> 00:14:23,571
And this is the first time
we'll get to be together for a long time.

119
00:14:24,613 --> 00:14:27,324
<i>I already quit work.</i>

120
00:14:28,576 --> 00:14:33,914
<i>But I don't know if I want to</i>
<i>entrust my life to this particular man.</i>

121
00:14:33,998 --> 00:14:36,458
<i>Would he even want to take care of me?</i>

122
00:14:38,460 --> 00:14:43,507
<i>I wonder who that man is.</i>
<i>I'm totally jealous of him.</i>

123
00:14:44,633 --> 00:14:46,927
You're such a sweet-talker.

124
00:14:50,306 --> 00:14:53,058
The village shaman
is performing a ceremony again.

125
00:15:00,649 --> 00:15:01,692
Hurry up!

126
00:15:08,240 --> 00:15:09,992
Please keep driving.

127
00:15:13,078 --> 00:15:14,413
Don't be afraid.

128
00:15:29,929 --> 00:15:31,138
Here?

129
00:15:32,389 --> 00:15:33,223
That's right.

130
00:16:06,674 --> 00:16:09,218
How is it? Do you like it?

131
00:16:10,052 --> 00:16:11,303
It's beautiful.

132
00:16:18,227 --> 00:16:19,770
How much is it per night?

133
00:16:24,483 --> 00:16:25,609
This is our house.

134
00:16:32,032 --> 00:16:34,660
You told me
you didn't want to stay in a small room.

135
00:16:34,743 --> 00:16:36,787
So I brought you to a large house.

136
00:16:37,621 --> 00:16:38,706
Is it big enough?

137
00:16:39,415 --> 00:16:43,002
If it isn't, there's also that mountain
over there that's ours as well.

138
00:17:24,460 --> 00:17:25,419
Are you happy?

139
00:17:28,630 --> 00:17:29,840
I'm so happy.

140
00:17:31,216 --> 00:17:32,468
Thank you.

141
00:17:33,552 --> 00:17:35,471
I'll show you our master bedroom first.

142
00:17:36,597 --> 00:17:37,514
Okay.

143
00:17:39,016 --> 00:17:40,059
Here it is.

144
00:17:42,227 --> 00:17:44,521
And there's also a smaller room,

145
00:17:44,605 --> 00:17:49,068
in case we have a kid one day.

146
00:17:58,786 --> 00:18:02,998
Is all of this really mine?

147
00:18:04,374 --> 00:18:05,292
Of course it is.

148
00:18:06,710 --> 00:18:07,753
As well as…

149
00:18:11,799 --> 00:18:14,218
the person standing right in front of you.

150
00:18:22,768 --> 00:18:24,311
I want it strong, okay?

151
00:18:24,394 --> 00:18:25,562
Sure.

152
00:18:49,378 --> 00:18:50,462
Cheev…

153
00:18:51,088 --> 00:18:51,922
Yes?

154
00:18:52,923 --> 00:18:55,134
- Cheev…
- What is it?

155
00:18:55,217 --> 00:18:57,261
There's someone outside, doing something.

156
00:18:59,054 --> 00:18:59,888
Damn.

157
00:19:01,890 --> 00:19:03,100
Wait here.

158
00:19:04,476 --> 00:19:05,310
Cheev.

159
00:19:09,898 --> 00:19:11,525
Hey! Get out of here!

160
00:19:12,609 --> 00:19:13,694
I said leave!

161
00:19:15,487 --> 00:19:16,488
Leave now!

162
00:19:17,823 --> 00:19:19,783
If you don't leave, I'll shoot you.

163
00:19:26,456 --> 00:19:27,374
Shit.

164
00:19:46,018 --> 00:19:47,394
Who was it?

165
00:19:47,477 --> 00:19:48,604
The village shaman.

166
00:19:49,104 --> 00:19:51,481
He goes around
spreading rumors of hauntings.

167
00:19:52,608 --> 00:19:54,943
Then he performs rituals
to scam people for money.

168
00:19:56,653 --> 00:19:58,113
I think it's total nonsense.

169
00:19:59,323 --> 00:20:01,158
That's pretty scary.

170
00:20:03,410 --> 00:20:07,039
Luckily, I have you with me.

171
00:20:10,709 --> 00:20:12,002
I'm sorry.

172
00:20:12,753 --> 00:20:14,129
Now the mood is ruined.

173
00:20:16,256 --> 00:20:18,091
I'm afraid you won't have any fun.

174
00:20:23,180 --> 00:20:25,182
When did I say that?

175
00:20:26,433 --> 00:20:29,353
That this isn't any fun.
I never said that.

176
00:20:32,981 --> 00:20:34,650
I just want you to be happy.

177
00:20:36,735 --> 00:20:39,947
I want to make up for the time
I didn't get to take care of you.

178
00:20:43,617 --> 00:20:47,871
And how are you going to do that?

179
00:22:40,984 --> 00:22:42,527
What are you daydreaming about?

180
00:22:43,278 --> 00:22:44,738
You surprised me.

181
00:22:47,741 --> 00:22:49,117
It's nothing.

182
00:22:49,201 --> 00:22:51,411
- Just…
- Did I scare you?

183
00:22:52,162 --> 00:22:54,581
Well, I was caught off guard.

184
00:22:55,499 --> 00:22:56,458
What's up?

185
00:22:56,541 --> 00:22:59,461
Nothing. I was just thinking
of taking you to bed.

186
00:22:59,544 --> 00:23:01,254
Oh, sure. Let's go.

187
00:23:41,795 --> 00:23:42,921
Cheev.

188
00:23:53,682 --> 00:23:55,183
Cheev?

189
00:24:01,731 --> 00:24:02,691
Cheev.

190
00:24:14,703 --> 00:24:16,121
Cheev.

191
00:24:36,766 --> 00:24:37,684
Cheev!

192
00:26:45,520 --> 00:26:48,648
Ros. First of all, will you calm down?

193
00:26:48,732 --> 00:26:50,734
Ros. Ros, listen to me.

194
00:26:50,817 --> 00:26:52,527
Why is she here?

195
00:26:52,610 --> 00:26:54,821
- Because it's necessary.
- Why is it necessary?

196
00:26:54,904 --> 00:26:56,656
Lunthom put it in her will.

197
00:26:56,740 --> 00:27:00,493
If I stay with her corpse for 100 days,
everything will be ours.

198
00:27:01,786 --> 00:27:03,830
The house isn't ours yet?

199
00:27:05,832 --> 00:27:07,584
But it's definitely gonna be ours.

200
00:27:08,877 --> 00:27:11,880
We just have to endure it.
It's a condition in the will.

201
00:27:11,963 --> 00:27:13,131
How am I to endure this?

202
00:27:13,214 --> 00:27:15,008
I have to live with it for 100 days?

203
00:27:15,675 --> 00:27:18,428
No… You just need to stay with me.

204
00:27:19,554 --> 00:27:20,680
Ignore the corpse.

205
00:27:20,764 --> 00:27:23,308
You don't even need to
take a step into this room.

206
00:27:23,391 --> 00:27:24,225
Okay?

207
00:27:28,271 --> 00:27:29,189
Ros?

208
00:27:32,650 --> 00:27:34,527
Let's get through this together, okay?

209
00:27:35,278 --> 00:27:38,031
Once everything is ours,
we'll get married.

210
00:27:40,325 --> 00:27:42,577
We'll be husband and wife, legally.

211
00:27:46,164 --> 00:27:48,792
We've been through so much together.

212
00:29:34,063 --> 00:29:35,356
I found it in your pocket.

213
00:29:35,482 --> 00:29:37,108
RETURNING YOUR CIGARETTES, THANKS

214
00:29:37,192 --> 00:29:38,985
Who do they belong to?

215
00:29:41,112 --> 00:29:43,323
One of the guys in the factory.

216
00:29:43,948 --> 00:29:45,074
It's nothing.

217
00:29:48,870 --> 00:29:50,538
Cheev, can you tell me

218
00:29:51,372 --> 00:29:54,250
what I have to do
to get you to stop lying to me?

219
00:29:58,046 --> 00:29:59,964
Well, I'm telling you the truth.

220
00:30:01,341 --> 00:30:02,842
Why are you always on my case?

221
00:30:06,179 --> 00:30:08,348
I'm asking who these belong to.

222
00:30:13,603 --> 00:30:14,979
Someone at the factory.

223
00:30:19,901 --> 00:30:22,445
Stop pressuring me.

224
00:30:29,619 --> 00:30:32,080
Do you know how stressful it is
being with you?

225
00:30:32,163 --> 00:30:33,915
All you ever do is work all day.

226
00:30:34,499 --> 00:30:36,584
The house and factory
are in the same place.

227
00:30:36,668 --> 00:30:39,504
We never go out. We have no personal life.

228
00:30:41,798 --> 00:30:45,093
I really want to know,
are you satisfied with this life?

229
00:30:53,309 --> 00:30:54,143
Cheev.

230
00:30:58,398 --> 00:31:01,943
Is it because of me
that you have someone else?

231
00:31:05,738 --> 00:31:07,448
It's not because of you.

232
00:31:07,532 --> 00:31:09,158
It's my fault.

233
00:31:10,326 --> 00:31:11,411
I'm sorry.

234
00:31:19,711 --> 00:31:22,338
Let's work this out together.

235
00:31:27,260 --> 00:31:29,470
So, where are we going?

236
00:31:33,349 --> 00:31:34,267
We're here.

237
00:32:04,088 --> 00:32:05,340
Whose house is this?

238
00:32:06,257 --> 00:32:07,634
This is our house.

239
00:32:10,261 --> 00:32:11,763
You don't have to do this.

240
00:32:11,846 --> 00:32:14,223
We'll be together, just the two of us.

241
00:32:14,307 --> 00:32:16,726
A wholesome family.

242
00:32:20,980 --> 00:32:25,735
This lunthom tree will symbolize our love:

243
00:32:26,486 --> 00:32:29,572
stable and strong.

244
00:32:49,801 --> 00:32:51,219
Are you awake already?

245
00:32:53,054 --> 00:32:54,681
You're quite the sleepyhead, huh?

246
00:32:55,890 --> 00:32:59,519
Today, I'll show you
the prettiest view around.

247
00:33:04,107 --> 00:33:07,610
Ros, can you prepare lots of food for us?

248
00:33:08,361 --> 00:33:09,278
Sure.

249
00:34:02,248 --> 00:34:04,751
Ros, let's go.
I'll wait for you out front.

250
00:34:05,460 --> 00:34:06,461
Oh, okay.

251
00:34:12,258 --> 00:34:13,092
Are you tired?

252
00:34:14,594 --> 00:34:15,720
Well, a little bit.

253
00:34:17,263 --> 00:34:18,598
We're getting closer, Ros.

254
00:34:25,563 --> 00:34:26,397
Here we are.

255
00:34:45,666 --> 00:34:47,168
Breathtaking, isn't it?

256
00:34:49,879 --> 00:34:51,339
It's quite high up, huh?

257
00:34:52,215 --> 00:34:53,966
Don't look down, then.

258
00:34:54,050 --> 00:34:56,219
Just look ahead. It's so vast.

259
00:35:10,942 --> 00:35:13,277
Our house is beautiful from this view.

260
00:35:15,905 --> 00:35:19,117
But there's the lunthom tree
in front of the house.

261
00:35:19,200 --> 00:35:20,243
It's so inauspicious.

262
00:35:21,160 --> 00:35:22,078
Ros…

263
00:35:24,622 --> 00:35:26,165
It's just a tree.

264
00:35:30,169 --> 00:35:35,716
How about I change it
with a different tree?

265
00:35:37,593 --> 00:35:38,803
I'll hold you to that.

266
00:35:43,307 --> 00:35:44,684
We're here.

267
00:35:44,767 --> 00:35:45,601
Cheev…

268
00:35:47,562 --> 00:35:49,730
What's this place for?

269
00:35:50,773 --> 00:35:52,859
Oh, it's storage.

270
00:35:54,652 --> 00:35:56,154
It's quite chic.

271
00:35:56,237 --> 00:35:57,697
Can I go and take a look?

272
00:35:57,780 --> 00:36:01,826
If my friends come visit,
we can use this as a guest house.

273
00:36:01,909 --> 00:36:03,911
I think we should eat first. I'm hungry.

274
00:36:03,995 --> 00:36:05,621
I just want to take a peek.

275
00:36:08,291 --> 00:36:11,961
Ros, babe. Ros.

276
00:36:38,738 --> 00:36:40,031
Cheev.

277
00:36:45,411 --> 00:36:47,246
Will you draw a picture of me?

278
00:36:51,792 --> 00:36:53,211
Draw me really pretty, okay?

279
00:37:04,305 --> 00:37:05,306
Is this okay?

280
00:37:09,936 --> 00:37:11,896
Show your leg a bit more.

281
00:37:27,411 --> 00:37:31,082
You're really sexy when you're so focused.

282
00:37:42,927 --> 00:37:44,720
Draw me as pretty as you can.

283
00:37:50,226 --> 00:37:51,394
Cheev.

284
00:37:53,562 --> 00:37:54,480
Baby.

285
00:37:57,149 --> 00:37:57,984
Cheev.

286
00:38:01,946 --> 00:38:02,822
Cheev.

287
00:38:04,657 --> 00:38:05,574
Cheev!

288
00:38:06,409 --> 00:38:07,243
Yes?

289
00:38:08,786 --> 00:38:09,745
That's not me.

290
00:38:10,997 --> 00:38:12,206
Shit.

291
00:38:12,748 --> 00:38:13,833
Ros, I'm sorry.

292
00:38:13,916 --> 00:38:15,293
Ros, hear me out.

293
00:38:15,376 --> 00:38:16,877
- Go draw your ex-wife.
- Sorry.

294
00:38:16,961 --> 00:38:19,088
Ros, I have no idea how I drew that.

295
00:38:52,246 --> 00:38:54,248
Cheev, let's eat.

296
00:38:55,374 --> 00:38:56,208
Okay.

297
00:39:05,426 --> 00:39:07,345
Wow, it looks super delicious.

298
00:39:10,598 --> 00:39:11,766
Here's some rice.

299
00:39:15,561 --> 00:39:18,731
It's probably not as good
as your ex-wife's cooking.

300
00:39:19,315 --> 00:39:21,359
I've already forgotten it all.

301
00:39:23,069 --> 00:39:24,570
Your drawing says otherwise.

302
00:39:25,988 --> 00:39:27,114
Babe…

303
00:39:29,408 --> 00:39:31,369
Please try to understand me.

304
00:39:31,452 --> 00:39:33,579
I was with Lunthom for seven years.

305
00:39:33,662 --> 00:39:36,040
She made me draw her every day.

306
00:39:37,166 --> 00:39:40,711
Over and over, to the point
I don't want to draw anymore.

307
00:39:41,420 --> 00:39:43,547
Ros, don't make me draw again, please.

308
00:39:44,507 --> 00:39:46,258
I'm afraid you'll hate me.

309
00:39:51,639 --> 00:39:54,141
I couldn't hate you if I tried.

310
00:39:54,225 --> 00:39:55,059
Eat.

311
00:39:57,478 --> 00:39:59,939
You're not angry with me anymore, right?

312
00:40:00,940 --> 00:40:02,691
I guess you're not mad anymore…

313
00:40:02,775 --> 00:40:04,944
Can I sit near you, then?

314
00:40:06,362 --> 00:40:08,072
- No.
- You're not mad anymore, right?

315
00:40:08,155 --> 00:40:09,865
I'm all sweaty.

316
00:40:11,409 --> 00:40:13,119
I'm all sticky.

317
00:40:13,202 --> 00:40:17,706
What do you want to do first,
eat or take a bath?

318
00:41:42,917 --> 00:41:44,335
Ros.

319
00:41:45,336 --> 00:41:46,837
- Lunthom.
- Ros, what's wrong?

320
00:41:46,921 --> 00:41:49,173
Lunthom.

321
00:41:49,840 --> 00:41:51,383
Ros, please calm down.

322
00:41:52,718 --> 00:41:57,431
I think you were having a nightmare
and fell out of bed.

323
00:41:58,182 --> 00:41:59,892
I really saw her, Cheev.

324
00:41:59,975 --> 00:42:01,727
- Okay.
- I really did.

325
00:42:01,810 --> 00:42:05,314
Okay, Ros. You're here with me.
There's nothing to be afraid of.

326
00:42:08,901 --> 00:42:12,655
<i>The final question, for one million…</i>

327
00:42:12,738 --> 00:42:14,156
Cheev…

328
00:42:14,240 --> 00:42:15,324
Yes, baby?

329
00:42:18,244 --> 00:42:21,956
Can't we stay somewhere else first
and then come back?

330
00:42:22,039 --> 00:42:23,082
Please.

331
00:42:23,749 --> 00:42:25,376
I understand that you're afraid.

332
00:42:27,461 --> 00:42:31,382
I'll light some incense
and tell Lunthom to leave us alone.

333
00:42:36,303 --> 00:42:40,474
I understand that
you don't want to stay here.

334
00:42:40,558 --> 00:42:43,018
I don't want to live with a corpse either.

335
00:42:44,562 --> 00:42:49,733
But I want you to stick it out.
It won't be long.

336
00:42:51,485 --> 00:42:54,238
I don't want to stay here.
I just can't bear it.

337
00:42:58,033 --> 00:43:01,495
But if you don't stay here,
everything will be finished.

338
00:43:06,500 --> 00:43:07,835
What do you mean?

339
00:43:15,050 --> 00:43:16,844
Well, in the will,

340
00:43:18,178 --> 00:43:21,599
it says you must stay here with me
for 100 days,

341
00:43:21,682 --> 00:43:23,350
or we walk out empty-handed.

342
00:43:25,311 --> 00:43:30,649
Do you want me to stay here because
you want to be with me, or for money?

343
00:43:30,733 --> 00:43:34,153
I want to be with you
but I also want us to have everything.

344
00:43:35,029 --> 00:43:37,865
<i>One million, that's one million!</i>

345
00:43:37,948 --> 00:43:39,992
<i>Congratulations to Ms. Na and her family!</i>

346
00:43:40,075 --> 00:43:41,410
Look at the TV.

347
00:43:42,119 --> 00:43:45,497
Not everyone will be lucky
like these guys.

348
00:43:45,581 --> 00:43:48,417
But right now, we have everything, Ros.

349
00:43:48,500 --> 00:43:50,711
It's all here. Everything we'll ever need.

350
00:43:50,794 --> 00:43:53,505
We don't have to try our luck
like on the game show.

351
00:43:54,256 --> 00:43:56,592
All we need to do is tough it out.

352
00:44:00,220 --> 00:44:04,308
It won't be long
before everything will be ours.

353
00:44:09,813 --> 00:44:11,357
But she's haunting me.

354
00:44:12,441 --> 00:44:14,026
Get it? I'm being haunted.

355
00:44:14,109 --> 00:44:16,028
From now, I'll take care of you.

356
00:44:17,404 --> 00:44:19,198
I won't let anything happen to you.

357
00:45:32,187 --> 00:45:35,065
It's the third time
Ms. Lunthom fell into a deep sleep.

358
00:45:35,149 --> 00:45:38,569
I still cannot determine the cause.

359
00:45:39,570 --> 00:45:44,074
She can sleep for many days,
with no sign of when she will wake.

360
00:45:45,075 --> 00:45:48,412
I advise you
to take special care of Ms. Lunthom.

361
00:45:48,495 --> 00:45:51,957
She might leave us at any moment.

362
00:46:48,597 --> 00:46:49,431
Ros…

363
00:46:52,017 --> 00:46:53,268
Why are you here?

364
00:46:54,937 --> 00:46:57,314
It's been several days since
you've disappeared.

365
00:46:58,065 --> 00:47:00,025
Ros, I have to take care of her.

366
00:47:00,108 --> 00:47:01,860
Then you stay here, I'll leave.

367
00:47:01,944 --> 00:47:02,778
Ros.

368
00:47:03,570 --> 00:47:04,863
I'm not letting you leave.

369
00:47:07,950 --> 00:47:11,286
I love you, Ros.

370
00:47:12,120 --> 00:47:14,248
I love only you, Ros.

371
00:48:11,763 --> 00:48:13,265
Is there something wrong?

372
00:48:15,767 --> 00:48:18,061
You're allergic to cigarette smoke.

373
00:48:19,646 --> 00:48:22,065
If you don't quit, you might die.

374
00:48:25,819 --> 00:48:27,070
What do you mean?

375
00:48:46,048 --> 00:48:47,507
Get out of our lives.

376
00:48:48,425 --> 00:48:50,093
While you still have the chance.

377
00:48:57,976 --> 00:49:03,649
I don't think
you should be saying that to me.

378
00:49:27,089 --> 00:49:28,882
Don't drink too much.

379
00:49:31,093 --> 00:49:32,511
Did you smoke again?

380
00:49:33,637 --> 00:49:35,263
I'm a bit stressed with work.

381
00:49:37,557 --> 00:49:38,850
I'm going to sleep.

382
00:49:49,236 --> 00:49:52,030
What are you doing?
You're allergic to cigarettes.

383
00:49:58,870 --> 00:50:03,959
Smoking is addictive, isn't it?
Which is why you can't quit.

384
00:50:16,388 --> 00:50:17,431
Let's call it quits.

385
00:50:18,306 --> 00:50:19,516
Quit what?

386
00:50:21,393 --> 00:50:22,561
What did I do wrong?

387
00:50:24,563 --> 00:50:25,397
"Do wrong"?

388
00:50:27,733 --> 00:50:28,984
You still don't know?

389
00:50:30,444 --> 00:50:32,571
I've given you a lot of chances already.

390
00:50:33,447 --> 00:50:35,198
But you still keep doing it.

391
00:50:36,366 --> 00:50:37,200
I'm exhausted.

392
00:50:38,160 --> 00:50:40,620
I thought you said
we'd be together forever.

393
00:50:40,704 --> 00:50:42,873
We'd complete each other forever.

394
00:50:43,790 --> 00:50:44,875
All I have in my life…

395
00:50:46,668 --> 00:50:48,170
is you.

396
00:50:52,048 --> 00:50:54,426
I've done everything for the both of us.

397
00:50:58,638 --> 00:51:01,057
All I ask is for you
to stay loyal to me as well.

398
00:51:02,350 --> 00:51:03,894
How difficult can that be?

399
00:51:09,483 --> 00:51:11,860
I'm going to bed. I don't want to fight.

400
00:51:12,903 --> 00:51:14,237
You came with nothing.

401
00:51:17,616 --> 00:51:19,409
So you leave with nothing as well.

402
00:51:21,953 --> 00:51:23,955
Go to that other woman.

403
00:51:28,084 --> 00:51:29,127
What's with you?

404
00:51:31,838 --> 00:51:32,672
Lunthom?

405
00:51:33,632 --> 00:51:35,425
If you cut me off, will you survive?

406
00:51:38,845 --> 00:51:41,056
Do you want to know why I chose her?

407
00:51:43,099 --> 00:51:45,560
Staying with you is insufferable.
I'm so unhappy.

408
00:51:51,149 --> 00:51:52,901
All you do is force me to do things.

409
00:51:52,984 --> 00:51:54,861
You order me to submit to you.

410
00:51:54,945 --> 00:51:57,030
Staying in this house feels like a prison!

411
00:51:57,113 --> 00:51:58,323
This is a home?

412
00:51:59,449 --> 00:52:01,785
Cheev. Cheev!

413
00:52:03,286 --> 00:52:04,120
Help me!

414
00:52:05,580 --> 00:52:06,414
Help.

415
00:52:09,334 --> 00:52:12,420
You're the one who kicked me out.

416
00:52:13,004 --> 00:52:14,965
Now you want me to help you?

417
00:52:36,778 --> 00:52:37,612
Cheev.

418
00:54:30,433 --> 00:54:31,351
Ros.

419
00:54:31,434 --> 00:54:33,228
Hey, Ros, what happened?

420
00:54:33,937 --> 00:54:34,771
Ros. Ros.

421
00:54:36,189 --> 00:54:38,483
Hey. Ros, you're bleeding.

422
00:54:39,234 --> 00:54:40,151
Ros, wait here.

423
00:54:40,235 --> 00:54:42,862
I'll go get some medicine
to put on your cut.

424
00:55:04,175 --> 00:55:06,761
You did this to me, right?
It's my turn now!

425
00:55:13,393 --> 00:55:15,603
Ros. Ros, stop! That's enough!

426
00:55:15,687 --> 00:55:16,521
Let go.

427
00:55:17,147 --> 00:55:18,106
Cheev, let go of me!

428
00:55:18,189 --> 00:55:19,315
I told you to stop!

429
00:55:21,568 --> 00:55:22,610
Ros, stop it now!

430
00:55:22,694 --> 00:55:25,488
Why? It hurt me.
Why can't you protect me as well?

431
00:55:25,572 --> 00:55:26,531
Enough already!

432
00:55:26,614 --> 00:55:28,324
- Are you protecting it?
- What?

433
00:55:28,408 --> 00:55:30,368
- Are you protecting it?
- I'm not.

434
00:55:30,452 --> 00:55:31,661
There. It's there.

435
00:55:32,454 --> 00:55:33,329
It's there…

436
00:55:33,413 --> 00:55:34,414
What is it, Ros?

437
00:55:36,207 --> 00:55:37,584
Have you lost your mind?

438
00:55:39,794 --> 00:55:41,212
Do you think I'm lying?

439
00:55:42,213 --> 00:55:44,466
Do you think I'm lying? I'm crazy?

440
00:55:44,549 --> 00:55:45,550
Yes!

441
00:55:45,633 --> 00:55:47,635
Ros, take a look at what you did!

442
00:55:47,719 --> 00:55:48,595
Isn't it crazy?

443
00:55:51,389 --> 00:55:52,724
Ros, listen to me.

444
00:55:52,849 --> 00:55:54,934
I'm trying to do everything for us.

445
00:55:55,018 --> 00:55:56,561
But look at what you've done.

446
00:55:57,562 --> 00:55:59,272
You're destroying everything.

447
00:56:00,690 --> 00:56:03,777
If you aren't helping,
then stay out of my way.

448
00:56:03,860 --> 00:56:05,278
Don't enter this room again.

449
00:57:29,863 --> 00:57:30,697
Cheev.

450
00:57:31,531 --> 00:57:32,365
Cheev.

451
01:01:11,584 --> 01:01:13,711
Ros. Ros, what's wrong?

452
01:01:16,714 --> 01:01:18,216
Ros, calm down. Calm down.

453
01:01:18,299 --> 01:01:20,093
Cheev.

454
01:01:20,593 --> 01:01:22,553
Lunthom's ghost.

455
01:01:22,637 --> 01:01:26,015
Lunthom's ghost.
She's going to kill me, Cheev!

456
01:01:26,099 --> 01:01:28,976
Cheev. Cheev! Just now.

457
01:01:29,060 --> 01:01:30,103
Lunthom again, Ros?

458
01:01:30,186 --> 01:01:34,607
It just dragged me down. It slapped me.
It's going to kill me, Cheev.

459
01:01:34,691 --> 01:01:35,775
It's going to kill me.

460
01:01:35,858 --> 01:01:38,069
Ros, what do you mean,
it's going to kill you?

461
01:01:38,152 --> 01:01:38,986
Nothing's wrong.

462
01:01:39,070 --> 01:01:41,531
Cheev, look. Look at my hand.
My hand, Cheev.

463
01:01:41,614 --> 01:01:44,325
- There's nothing wrong with your hands!
- Blood.

464
01:01:44,409 --> 01:01:46,369
Look at what? What blood, Ros?

465
01:01:46,452 --> 01:01:48,663
It's really going to kill me, Cheev!

466
01:01:48,746 --> 01:01:50,957
Ros, I don't see anything wrong at all.

467
01:01:51,624 --> 01:01:53,334
Ros, calm down.

468
01:01:53,960 --> 01:01:56,087
Ros, look. Did anything happen?

469
01:01:59,507 --> 01:02:00,883
I went to buy you some meds.

470
01:02:01,592 --> 01:02:03,761
Take them and get some rest.

471
01:02:07,473 --> 01:02:08,307
Cheev?

472
01:02:10,977 --> 01:02:12,103
Cheev!

473
01:04:05,925 --> 01:04:06,968
Are you screwing it?

474
01:04:07,051 --> 01:04:08,302
Screwing it?

475
01:04:12,223 --> 01:04:13,307
Screwing what?

476
01:04:19,355 --> 01:04:21,357
Is that all your sick brain can think of?

477
01:04:24,777 --> 01:04:26,946
I told you, didn't I? Don't come in here.

478
01:06:41,539 --> 01:06:42,873
What the hell are you doing?

479
01:06:43,708 --> 01:06:44,583
Cheev!

480
01:06:45,626 --> 01:06:48,087
Cheev!

481
01:06:49,088 --> 01:06:50,589
You really want a ghost, hey?

482
01:06:50,673 --> 01:06:51,549
Cheev.

483
01:06:51,632 --> 01:06:53,342
Or would you rather end up as one?

484
01:06:54,093 --> 01:06:55,136
- Get out!
- Cheev!

485
01:06:56,012 --> 01:06:56,846
Leave!

486
01:06:58,681 --> 01:07:02,268
Cheev, stop it! They're helping us.

487
01:07:02,351 --> 01:07:03,269
Helping with what?

488
01:07:03,352 --> 01:07:04,562
He's helping us.

489
01:07:04,645 --> 01:07:06,439
He's setting fire to our house.

490
01:07:06,522 --> 01:07:08,107
He's getting rid of Lunthom.

491
01:07:08,190 --> 01:07:11,402
There isn't a ghost.
Come to your senses, will you?

492
01:07:11,485 --> 01:07:12,778
Are you protecting it?

493
01:07:14,405 --> 01:07:15,489
Are you?

494
01:07:15,573 --> 01:07:16,866
What am I protecting?

495
01:07:16,949 --> 01:07:20,578
I'm sick and tired of guarding a corpse.
You've never helped me!

496
01:07:21,662 --> 01:07:22,788
I'm exhausted!

497
01:07:22,872 --> 01:07:23,956
So am I!

498
01:07:25,666 --> 01:07:28,419
Listen to me.
It's time to stop this craziness!

499
01:07:54,653 --> 01:07:55,488
Ros.

500
01:07:56,280 --> 01:07:57,615
Ros, where are you going?

501
01:07:58,282 --> 01:08:00,201
Ros, I'm sorry for what I said.

502
01:08:00,910 --> 01:08:01,869
Let go of me.

503
01:08:05,289 --> 01:08:08,084
You betrayed me. Let go.

504
01:08:08,167 --> 01:08:10,753
I didn't betray you.
I don't love Lunthom anymore.

505
01:08:12,963 --> 01:08:14,673
I've had enough, Cheev.

506
01:08:14,757 --> 01:08:16,008
Let me go.

507
01:08:16,092 --> 01:08:18,010
Ros, listen to me first.

508
01:08:18,094 --> 01:08:19,386
Where will you go?

509
01:08:20,054 --> 01:08:21,889
You don't have a job or money.

510
01:08:21,972 --> 01:08:23,933
You'd rather return to that small room?

511
01:08:25,226 --> 01:08:26,727
What would you rather me do?

512
01:08:27,561 --> 01:08:29,814
I'm tired. I've had enough, Cheev.

513
01:08:29,897 --> 01:08:30,731
Ros.

514
01:08:31,398 --> 01:08:33,567
We've been here for almost 100 days.

515
01:08:34,193 --> 01:08:35,402
We're so close, Ros.

516
01:08:35,486 --> 01:08:37,071
Screw the 100 days.

517
01:08:37,154 --> 01:08:38,030
- Ros.
- Let go.

518
01:08:38,114 --> 01:08:40,574
Ros, this house is about to be ours.

519
01:08:40,658 --> 01:08:42,076
Just a couple more days.

520
01:08:42,159 --> 01:08:45,246
Let go of me, Cheev.
I can't take it anymore.

521
01:08:47,832 --> 01:08:51,377
Ros. Ros, you can't go.

522
01:08:53,129 --> 01:08:56,215
I let Lunthom die so I could be with you.

523
01:09:03,222 --> 01:09:05,224
I'm the one who let her die.

524
01:09:11,397 --> 01:09:13,399
I want to be with you.

525
01:09:14,150 --> 01:09:15,860
Please don't go.

526
01:09:16,360 --> 01:09:18,028
I'm begging you.

527
01:09:19,905 --> 01:09:23,117
If you go, I really won't have
anything left.

528
01:09:23,701 --> 01:09:25,286
Please stay with me.

529
01:09:26,954 --> 01:09:27,913
Ros.

530
01:09:34,503 --> 01:09:35,379
Ros.

531
01:09:42,511 --> 01:09:43,846
Please don't leave!

532
01:09:45,514 --> 01:09:46,557
Ros!

533
01:12:06,989 --> 01:12:08,157
I'm sorry.

534
01:12:11,618 --> 01:12:12,828
Cheev.

535
01:12:14,246 --> 01:12:15,831
I love you.

536
01:12:17,499 --> 01:12:19,543
I can't stop loving you either.

537
01:12:26,050 --> 01:12:27,092
Cheev.

538
01:12:29,470 --> 01:12:31,555
Let's keep our promise.

539
01:12:33,974 --> 01:12:37,519
That no matter what comes our way,
we'll get through it together.

540
01:12:39,605 --> 01:12:40,814
We won't break up.

541
01:12:47,363 --> 01:12:49,031
You shouldn't have returned.

542
01:12:51,492 --> 01:12:53,494
Why are you saying that?

543
01:12:54,370 --> 01:12:56,747
Please don't be mad at me.

544
01:12:57,456 --> 01:13:00,292
Don't be mad at me. Please.

545
01:13:01,085 --> 01:13:03,295
You don't look handsome
with that expression.

546
01:13:03,379 --> 01:13:04,421
Look.

547
01:13:04,505 --> 01:13:08,050
Your hair's long, it's covering your eyes.

548
01:13:08,133 --> 01:13:10,427
I'll give you a haircut, okay?

549
01:13:11,095 --> 01:13:13,263
Just like always.

550
01:13:39,373 --> 01:13:40,916
What's with the scowl?

551
01:14:00,227 --> 01:14:02,312
You should've been honest since the start.

552
01:14:02,396 --> 01:14:04,898
That way, we wouldn't have
misunderstood each other.

553
01:14:09,903 --> 01:14:10,737
Cheev.

554
01:14:12,239 --> 01:14:13,157
Cheev!

555
01:14:20,247 --> 01:14:21,498
Did you know…

556
01:14:23,792 --> 01:14:24,626
that day…

557
01:14:27,880 --> 01:14:29,423
just how tormented I was?

558
01:14:33,302 --> 01:14:34,303
Cheev, sweetie.

559
01:14:37,306 --> 01:14:39,224
I don't want you to feel guilty.

560
01:14:41,268 --> 01:14:43,979
Let bygones be bygones.

561
01:14:45,355 --> 01:14:46,773
It's for the better.

562
01:14:48,025 --> 01:14:48,942
Who cares.

563
01:14:51,320 --> 01:14:52,863
Let me stop the bleeding first.

564
01:15:07,252 --> 01:15:08,670
Cheev.

565
01:15:13,884 --> 01:15:15,010
Cheev, sweetie.

566
01:15:21,850 --> 01:15:23,018
Cheev.

567
01:15:38,575 --> 01:15:39,409
Cheev.

568
01:15:51,088 --> 01:15:53,173
What are you doing, standing there?

569
01:16:18,907 --> 01:16:20,075
Cheev!

570
01:19:05,574 --> 01:19:06,658
Ros.

571
01:19:07,951 --> 01:19:08,869
Ros.

572
01:19:09,661 --> 01:19:10,495
Ros.

573
01:19:25,719 --> 01:19:28,680
Ros, where are you?

574
01:19:33,477 --> 01:19:36,146
You said we'd love each other
until the day we die.

575
01:19:40,150 --> 01:19:41,985
Rossukhon.

576
01:21:10,156 --> 01:21:11,950
You damn ghost!

577
01:21:12,033 --> 01:21:14,995
Do you think if you kill me,
he'll go back to you?

578
01:21:56,953 --> 01:21:58,914
I'm not going to let you die.

579
01:23:39,264 --> 01:23:46,271
I'm begging you.
Let me go… Let me and my man go!

580
01:24:16,968 --> 01:24:19,179
Why don't you go be together, then?

581
01:24:27,395 --> 01:24:29,355
<i>Do you honestly believe…</i>

582
01:24:29,856 --> 01:24:35,862
<i>that your story with Cheev</i>
<i>will be a happy ending?</i>

583
01:24:38,073 --> 01:24:41,159
<i>Since you refuse to walk away,</i>

584
01:24:42,952 --> 01:24:45,997
<i>you have no choice</i>
<i>but to accept your fate.</i>

585
01:24:57,175 --> 01:24:58,927
<i>How sad.</i>

586
01:24:59,010 --> 01:25:04,933
<i>You let the words of a man</i>
<i>you have no claim to</i>

587
01:25:05,016 --> 01:25:06,726
<i>define your worth.</i>

588
01:25:13,483 --> 01:25:15,944
<i>And this is where your story ends,</i>

589
01:25:16,027 --> 01:25:19,114
<i>for daring to force your way</i>
<i>into our lives.</i>

590
01:25:32,293 --> 01:25:33,670
<i>Cheev.</i>

591
01:25:33,753 --> 01:25:35,588
<i>No matter what happens,</i>

592
01:25:35,672 --> 01:25:38,383
<i>we are forever bound to one another.</i>
