=Bossy Husband Who Loved Me=
=Episode 7=

2
00:00:23,120 --> 00:00:24,440
What is it?

3
00:00:24,920 --> 00:00:25,639
Well,

4
00:00:25,639 --> 00:00:27,799
you have been working day and night.

5
00:00:27,799 --> 00:00:28,879
That's tiring.

6
00:00:29,040 --> 00:00:29,879
So I...

7
00:00:30,680 --> 00:00:31,520
So,

8
00:00:31,520 --> 00:00:35,439
I made some ice cream

9
00:00:35,599 --> 00:00:36,840
for you to strengthen your body.

10
00:00:39,959 --> 00:00:42,560
Considering the way
you've been treating me,

11
00:00:43,119 --> 00:00:44,479
you are behaving so nicely
out of a sudden.

12
00:00:44,840 --> 00:00:46,119
It reminds me of a saying,

13
00:00:46,560 --> 00:00:47,880
there ain't no such thing

14
00:00:48,080 --> 00:00:49,080
as a free lunch.

15
00:00:49,919 --> 00:00:50,680
Look at you.

16
00:00:50,840 --> 00:00:51,599
You overthink everything.

17
00:00:51,840 --> 00:00:52,360
Xiu.

18
00:00:52,880 --> 00:00:53,400
Yes.

19
00:01:02,439 --> 00:01:03,040
Your Highness,

20
00:01:04,120 --> 00:01:05,360
what is this?

21
00:01:05,480 --> 00:01:06,360
Ice cream.

22
00:01:06,360 --> 00:01:07,239
Icing?

23
00:01:08,279 --> 00:01:10,120
This is nothing like icing.

24
00:01:16,599 --> 00:01:18,160
Anyway, it's good stuff.

25
00:01:18,239 --> 00:01:19,199
Give it a taste.

26
00:01:20,360 --> 00:01:21,360
Wow.

27
00:01:21,639 --> 00:01:22,480
Your Highness,

28
00:01:22,919 --> 00:01:25,080
your study

29
00:01:25,080 --> 00:01:28,360
is wide and spacious.

30
00:01:29,599 --> 00:01:32,440
(Where exactly is the ledger?)

31
00:01:36,599 --> 00:01:39,199
The original plot only mentioned

32
00:01:39,199 --> 00:01:42,239
that the ledger was hidden
in a secret compartment.

33
00:01:42,879 --> 00:01:44,800
But where is the secret compartment?

34
00:01:46,160 --> 00:01:47,080
Wait.

35
00:01:47,080 --> 00:01:48,160
I'm running out of time.

36
00:01:48,160 --> 00:01:50,040
I must steal it
and give it to Prince Tan real quick.

37
00:01:53,519 --> 00:01:54,639
Why are you looking at me?

38
00:01:54,639 --> 00:01:55,319
Eat.

39
00:01:55,319 --> 00:01:56,400
It's fresh.

40
00:02:01,760 --> 00:02:02,919
Why

41
00:02:02,919 --> 00:02:04,400
are they staring at me?

42
00:02:04,760 --> 00:02:06,199
Are they

43
00:02:06,199 --> 00:02:07,919
suspecting me now?

44
00:02:08,360 --> 00:02:08,880
No way.

45
00:02:08,880 --> 00:02:09,720
There are too many people today.

46
00:02:09,720 --> 00:02:10,399
I can't take action now.

47
00:02:10,399 --> 00:02:11,240
I have to

48
00:02:11,240 --> 00:02:12,520
look for another chance.

49
00:02:14,600 --> 00:02:16,839
Are you shy to eat

50
00:02:16,960 --> 00:02:18,759
while I am here?

51
00:02:18,759 --> 00:02:20,399
It's okay, I'll leave.

52
00:02:20,600 --> 00:02:22,559
You can enjoy

53
00:02:22,559 --> 00:02:24,080
modern cuisine.

54
00:02:26,360 --> 00:02:27,559
Enjoy.

55
00:02:30,960 --> 00:02:31,720
Ice cream?

56
00:02:31,800 --> 00:02:32,679
Icing?

57
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:33,520
Woof!

58
00:02:36,520 --> 00:02:38,600
Her Highness is acting weird.

59
00:02:39,160 --> 00:02:40,000
Ledger.

60
00:02:41,919 --> 00:02:42,960
Prince Tan.

61
00:02:44,199 --> 00:02:45,399
Your Highness, what is it?

62
00:02:45,600 --> 00:02:47,279
She wanted to steal the ledger

63
00:02:47,279 --> 00:02:48,240
and give it to Prince Tan.

64
00:02:48,960 --> 00:02:49,960
Her Highness?

65
00:02:53,839 --> 00:02:54,679
I didn't expect

66
00:02:55,360 --> 00:02:57,080
Prince Tan to bribe Her Highness.

67
00:02:59,880 --> 00:03:01,520
It seems like
the mysterious "Yuan Ju Qing"

68
00:03:01,759 --> 00:03:03,199
is involved too.

69
00:03:03,520 --> 00:03:03,960
Then,

70
00:03:04,360 --> 00:03:05,600
Your Highness, what should we do next?

71
00:03:22,639 --> 00:03:24,520
(According to my setting,)

72
00:03:24,520 --> 00:03:27,039
Qin Chuan is a typical workaholic.

73
00:03:27,039 --> 00:03:28,960
He is dedicated
to his country and people.

74
00:03:29,399 --> 00:03:30,160
(Speaking of which,)

75
00:03:30,160 --> 00:03:31,839
(he's quite a respectable person.)

76
00:03:32,919 --> 00:03:34,000
I feel bad

77
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:35,559
for ruining his life.

78
00:03:35,880 --> 00:03:36,679
But,

79
00:03:36,679 --> 00:03:38,839
I can't go home
if I don't complete my task.

80
00:03:40,240 --> 00:03:41,119
After all,

81
00:03:41,199 --> 00:03:42,440
I have to steal the ledger.

82
00:04:36,760 --> 00:04:38,359
This is such
a piece of crucial evidence.

83
00:04:39,200 --> 00:04:42,000
Qin Chuan didn't seem to
keep it properly.

84
00:04:43,160 --> 00:04:44,079
But,

85
00:04:44,079 --> 00:04:45,160
according to the original plot,

86
00:04:45,760 --> 00:04:47,959
Qin Chuan lost the ledger.

87
00:04:48,119 --> 00:04:51,320
He couldn't solve the corruption case
due to the lack of evidence.

88
00:04:52,079 --> 00:04:54,760
Months of hard work go in vain,

89
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:57,119
the emperor is questioning him,

90
00:04:57,239 --> 00:04:58,920
and Prince Tan seizes the chance
to suppress him.

91
00:05:00,839 --> 00:05:02,440
He is in big trouble.

92
00:05:05,679 --> 00:05:06,720
Who cares!

93
00:05:06,959 --> 00:05:08,440
That's the original plot.

94
00:05:09,399 --> 00:05:11,239
Why do I care?

95
00:05:16,519 --> 00:05:19,519
They always say the protagonist in
angst fiction is raised by a stepmother.

96
00:05:20,559 --> 00:05:21,760
It seems like

97
00:05:21,760 --> 00:05:22,839
I go overboard

98
00:05:23,239 --> 00:05:24,279
with torturing him.

99
00:05:25,480 --> 00:05:26,239
Whatever.

100
00:05:26,239 --> 00:05:27,720
Let me treat him better for once.

101
00:05:28,559 --> 00:05:29,320
Xiu.

102
00:05:29,320 --> 00:05:30,480
Bring me my stationery.

103
00:05:50,079 --> 00:05:52,320
I've done my best.

104
00:06:26,119 --> 00:06:27,480
You are something.

105
00:06:30,559 --> 00:06:31,640
The Lover's Water

106
00:06:31,640 --> 00:06:32,839
is yours.

107
00:06:37,200 --> 00:06:38,959
I'm sure Fourth Brother

108
00:06:38,959 --> 00:06:40,239
will love you like crazy

109
00:06:40,239 --> 00:06:42,079
after he drinks this.

110
00:06:43,119 --> 00:06:44,920
Since we sealed the deal,

111
00:06:44,920 --> 00:06:46,000
goodbye then.

112
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:46,559
Bye.

113
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:07,839
She was colluded with Prince Tan indeed.

114
00:07:08,119 --> 00:07:09,600
She is unable to
separate right from wrong

115
00:07:09,600 --> 00:07:10,760
and siding with the abuser.

116
00:07:11,119 --> 00:07:11,720
But,

117
00:07:11,880 --> 00:07:13,160
what's bothering me is

118
00:07:13,160 --> 00:07:14,959
that after Her Highness
stole the ledger,

119
00:07:14,959 --> 00:07:16,320
she spent the night making another copy

120
00:07:16,320 --> 00:07:17,920
and putting it back.

121
00:07:18,600 --> 00:07:20,119
What was her intention?

122
00:07:22,040 --> 00:07:24,119
Perhaps she thought

123
00:07:24,119 --> 00:07:25,279
I might not realize
the ledger was stolen

124
00:07:25,279 --> 00:07:27,160
and replaced if she did this.

125
00:07:28,839 --> 00:07:30,320
But the appearance and handwriting

126
00:07:30,320 --> 00:07:32,200
of the ledger is very different

127
00:07:32,200 --> 00:07:33,480
from the original one.

128
00:07:33,799 --> 00:07:35,399
Did she think
she could hide it from you?

129
00:07:37,040 --> 00:07:37,880
I don't care about

130
00:07:38,079 --> 00:07:39,160
what's in her mind.

131
00:07:40,040 --> 00:07:41,079
This dumb woman.

132
00:07:41,279 --> 00:07:43,119
I wish I could expel her immediately.
