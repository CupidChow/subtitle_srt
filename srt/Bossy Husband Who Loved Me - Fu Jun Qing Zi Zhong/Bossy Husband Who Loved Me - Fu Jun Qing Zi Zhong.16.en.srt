2
00:00:08,960 --> 00:00:09,640
Second Brother.

3
00:00:10,319 --> 00:00:11,079
Second Brother.

4
00:00:12,600 --> 00:00:13,399
Second Brother.

5
00:00:14,079 --> 00:00:15,600
Do you still take me
as your Second Brother?

6
00:00:15,600 --> 00:00:16,239
Tell me now.

7
00:00:16,360 --> 00:00:18,000
Did your man steal the wrong poems?

8
00:00:18,719 --> 00:00:20,879
Judging from his expression,
I'm sure he stole the correct ones.

9
00:00:20,879 --> 00:00:23,000
I'm sure he made those poems up
on the spot.

10
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:24,239
On the spot?

11
00:00:24,920 --> 00:00:26,000
Fourth Brother's talent

12
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:27,319
is appalling.

13
00:00:27,319 --> 00:00:29,040
How dare you praise him?

14
00:00:29,520 --> 00:00:30,639
I didn't...

15
00:00:33,840 --> 00:00:35,000
"Chuan-pleaser"?

16
00:00:36,759 --> 00:00:37,720
"Chuan-pleaser".

17
00:00:38,319 --> 00:00:39,240
Your Highness.

18
00:00:39,360 --> 00:00:40,200
Your Highness.

19
00:00:42,360 --> 00:00:43,400
The poems

20
00:00:43,400 --> 00:00:44,959
have gone viral in the Capital.

21
00:00:50,240 --> 00:00:51,360
The writing is great.

22
00:00:51,360 --> 00:00:52,159
It's nice

23
00:00:52,159 --> 00:00:53,560
reciting this too.

24
00:00:53,840 --> 00:00:55,560
Princess Consort is so talented.

25
00:00:55,680 --> 00:00:57,159
I'm afraid

26
00:00:57,159 --> 00:00:59,240
that I'll never be a match for her.

27
00:01:01,919 --> 00:01:03,319
When you disliked her

28
00:01:03,319 --> 00:01:04,480
back then,

29
00:01:04,480 --> 00:01:06,000
you always referred to her

30
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:07,120
as "that woman".

31
00:01:07,120 --> 00:01:09,040
Now that everyone in the Capital
knows how talented she is,

32
00:01:09,360 --> 00:01:10,680
you start addressing her
as Princess Consort.

33
00:01:13,720 --> 00:01:14,720
What did you say?

34
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:17,160
I didn't say anything.

35
00:01:25,919 --> 00:01:27,599
The vast clouds, the blue sea,

36
00:01:27,599 --> 00:01:28,879
the dim snow mountains.

37
00:01:29,599 --> 00:01:30,959
The lone fort faces

38
00:01:30,959 --> 00:01:32,000
the distant Jade-Gate Pass.

39
00:01:32,680 --> 00:01:33,400
Your Highness.

40
00:01:34,040 --> 00:01:34,639
Did you hear

41
00:01:34,639 --> 00:01:36,239
these weird phrases

42
00:01:36,239 --> 00:01:37,599
in Her Highness' mind again?

43
00:01:40,639 --> 00:01:41,720
The terms

44
00:01:41,720 --> 00:01:43,400
are getting weirder and weirder.

45
00:01:43,800 --> 00:01:44,839
I really don't get them.

46
00:01:45,919 --> 00:01:46,599
But...

47
00:01:46,919 --> 00:01:47,599
This one.

48
00:01:47,599 --> 00:01:48,800
"Chuan-pleaser".

49
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:50,160
Does it mean

50
00:01:50,160 --> 00:01:51,559
that she wants to make you happy?

51
00:01:53,080 --> 00:01:54,120
Do you think so?

52
00:01:54,519 --> 00:01:55,239
Of course.

53
00:01:55,639 --> 00:01:56,040
When

54
00:01:56,040 --> 00:01:57,319
you upset His Majesty,

55
00:01:57,319 --> 00:01:58,839
Her Highness stood forward

56
00:01:58,839 --> 00:01:59,760
and interceded for you.

57
00:01:59,879 --> 00:02:01,599
Everyone in the Capital
has heard about this.

58
00:02:03,559 --> 00:02:04,839
Her Highness

59
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:06,760
is deeply in love with you.

60
00:02:12,119 --> 00:02:13,679
I think so too.

61
00:02:14,639 --> 00:02:15,600
Especially after hearing

62
00:02:15,880 --> 00:02:18,119
what she said to His Majesty just now.

63
00:02:19,279 --> 00:02:20,960
If we fight for peace,

64
00:02:20,960 --> 00:02:22,119
we'll coexist in peace.

65
00:02:22,119 --> 00:02:23,679
If we give in, hoping to seek peace,

66
00:02:23,679 --> 00:02:24,720
we'll die in peace.

67
00:02:25,639 --> 00:02:26,800
It's concise,

68
00:02:26,800 --> 00:02:27,919
but impactful.

69
00:02:28,639 --> 00:02:30,160
She understands me really well.

70
00:02:32,919 --> 00:02:33,839
But...

71
00:02:35,679 --> 00:02:36,240
There's only one thing

72
00:02:36,240 --> 00:02:38,240
I still don't understand yet.

73
00:02:38,520 --> 00:02:39,240
Why does Her Highness

74
00:02:39,240 --> 00:02:41,440
always act so frivolously?

75
00:02:42,119 --> 00:02:43,320
Not only that, but she also took part

76
00:02:43,320 --> 00:02:44,800
in multiple schemes
that are plotted against Your Highness.

77
00:02:46,080 --> 00:02:48,080
She must have been coerced into this
by "Yuan Ju Qing".

78
00:02:48,839 --> 00:02:51,160
From what I learned by reading her mind,

79
00:02:51,520 --> 00:02:52,800
"Yuan Ju Qing"

80
00:02:53,119 --> 00:02:54,919
can decide her fate and kill her.

81
00:02:55,639 --> 00:02:56,639
Is he that powerful?

82
00:02:57,679 --> 00:02:58,839
But

83
00:02:59,279 --> 00:03:00,880
who is "Yuan Ju Qing"?

84
00:03:01,039 --> 00:03:02,240
Whoever he is,

85
00:03:02,440 --> 00:03:03,240
I will not allow my woman

86
00:03:03,240 --> 00:03:04,759
to get threatened by anyone.

87
00:03:06,399 --> 00:03:07,199
Issue a decree on my behalf.

88
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:09,600
Deploy all the available Shadow Guards.

89
00:03:09,759 --> 00:03:11,080
We must find out who he is

90
00:03:11,279 --> 00:03:13,000
even if it means we need
to search the whole country.

91
00:03:13,360 --> 00:03:14,160
Yes, Your Highness.

92
00:03:19,039 --> 00:03:20,240
Wait a minute.

93
00:03:23,320 --> 00:03:26,440
Although I created Qin Chuan

94
00:03:27,080 --> 00:03:28,320
as a talented man,

95
00:03:28,600 --> 00:03:31,119
he shouldn't be as good
as Li Bai and Du Fu.

96
00:03:31,960 --> 00:03:34,559
Where did he learn those poems from?

97
00:03:35,520 --> 00:03:36,520
Besides,

98
00:03:37,279 --> 00:03:38,679
this is not the first time.

99
00:03:39,320 --> 00:03:40,839
The ledger.

100
00:03:40,839 --> 00:03:42,320
The witness.

101
00:03:43,039 --> 00:03:44,919
None of them followed the storyline
I wrote.

102
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:48,800
Storyline Manager.

103
00:03:49,720 --> 00:03:50,520
Storyline Manager.

104
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:52,240
Storyline Manager, show yourself.

105
00:03:52,759 --> 00:03:53,559
Storyline Manager.

106
00:03:55,440 --> 00:03:56,160
I have a question for you.

107
00:03:56,360 --> 00:03:58,080
What happened recently

108
00:03:58,080 --> 00:03:59,679
didn't follow what I wrote in the book.

109
00:04:00,240 --> 00:04:01,360
Are you trying to mess with me?

110
00:04:01,440 --> 00:04:02,800
I'm not.

111
00:04:03,039 --> 00:04:04,160
The world

112
00:04:04,160 --> 00:04:05,800
is operating as usual.

113
00:04:05,960 --> 00:04:07,960
There are only some hiccups
because of your presence.

114
00:04:08,960 --> 00:04:09,839
Because of me?

115
00:04:09,960 --> 00:04:10,639
Of course.

116
00:04:11,320 --> 00:04:13,559
But it's not a big deal,

117
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:15,399
as long as you complete

118
00:04:15,399 --> 00:04:16,920
your tasks obediently.

119
00:04:18,239 --> 00:04:19,640
Congratulations.

120
00:04:19,640 --> 00:04:21,519
You completed your mission

121
00:04:21,519 --> 00:04:24,200
and earned yourself
a Returning Piece.

122
00:04:32,600 --> 00:04:33,399
Then...

123
00:04:36,640 --> 00:04:37,440
Storyline Manager!

124
00:04:44,040 --> 00:04:45,239
Is it really my fault?

125
00:04:54,440 --> 00:04:55,320
"Yuan Ju Qing"?

126
00:04:55,559 --> 00:04:56,119
Yes.

127
00:04:56,239 --> 00:04:57,559
My name is Yuan Ju Qing.

128
00:05:05,279 --> 00:05:06,359
Your name is "Yuan Ju Qing"?

129
00:05:06,359 --> 00:05:07,200
Yes.

130
00:05:07,399 --> 00:05:08,559
Everyone in the brothel

131
00:05:08,559 --> 00:05:10,399
knows my name.

132
00:05:19,239 --> 00:05:20,239
You are "Yuan Ju Qing" too?

133
00:05:20,239 --> 00:05:21,200
I'm not.

134
00:05:21,200 --> 00:05:22,679
This is Yuan Ju Qing.

135
00:05:27,600 --> 00:05:29,040
These are the "Yuan Ju Qing" you found.

136
00:05:30,040 --> 00:05:31,040
Sorry to disappoint Your Highness.

137
00:05:31,040 --> 00:05:32,119
Please don't be mad at me.

138
00:05:34,239 --> 00:05:35,000
Leave.

139
00:05:37,160 --> 00:05:37,959
Get up.

140
00:05:42,320 --> 00:05:43,760
"Yuan Ju Qing"

141
00:05:43,760 --> 00:05:45,160
is a very mysterious man.

142
00:05:45,519 --> 00:05:46,959
We have searched everywhere,

143
00:05:46,959 --> 00:05:48,679
but to no avail.

144
00:05:49,640 --> 00:05:51,839
This guy tried to upset me repeatedly,

145
00:05:51,839 --> 00:05:53,079
but I'm not afraid of him.

146
00:05:53,600 --> 00:05:54,399
However,

147
00:05:54,399 --> 00:05:56,359
Xi got hurt several times
because I went against his order.

148
00:05:56,720 --> 00:05:58,519
I won't allow her to get hurt

149
00:05:58,799 --> 00:06:00,359
because of me again.

150
00:06:01,640 --> 00:06:02,760
Her Highness is willing

151
00:06:02,760 --> 00:06:04,720
to make such a huge sacrifice
for Your Highness.

152
00:06:04,880 --> 00:06:06,000
She obviously loves you

153
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:07,640
to the moon and back.

154
00:06:08,200 --> 00:06:08,920
But...

155
00:06:09,320 --> 00:06:10,640
Your Highness

156
00:06:10,760 --> 00:06:12,160
has been treating her rather coldly.

157
00:06:12,239 --> 00:06:13,760
That's why Her Highness
finds it difficult to count on you.

158
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:16,640
In my humble opinion,

159
00:06:16,880 --> 00:06:18,000
you should show Her Highness

160
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:19,160
some concern.

161
00:06:19,279 --> 00:06:20,040
Let her know

162
00:06:20,040 --> 00:06:21,519
that you really take her as your wife.

163
00:06:21,760 --> 00:06:23,920
Then, I'm sure she'll be willing

164
00:06:24,079 --> 00:06:25,200
to tell you more information
about "Yuan Ju Qing".

165
00:06:29,359 --> 00:06:30,200
You're right.

166
00:06:31,040 --> 00:06:32,519
I agree with you.

167
00:06:32,720 --> 00:06:34,320
She's my wife,

168
00:06:34,760 --> 00:06:36,079
and she's supposed to be able
to rely on me.
