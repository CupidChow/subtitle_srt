1
00:00:03,680 --> 00:00:08,420
=Bossy Husband Who Loved Me=
=Episode 22=

2
00:00:08,680 --> 00:00:10,880
Miss Liu, stop playing the fool.

3
00:00:11,479 --> 00:00:13,399
I came here only for one thing.

4
00:00:13,760 --> 00:00:14,720
Who is

5
00:00:15,560 --> 00:00:16,719
"Yuan Ju Qing"?

6
00:00:17,319 --> 00:00:18,879
You're making no sense.

7
00:00:22,879 --> 00:00:24,520
My original plan

8
00:00:24,920 --> 00:00:26,360
is to use Mu Xiaoxi as a pawn

9
00:00:26,360 --> 00:00:27,840
and tarnish your name,

10
00:00:27,840 --> 00:00:28,879
so that you won't be able
to lead the troops.

11
00:00:29,520 --> 00:00:30,719
But since you've already found out

12
00:00:30,719 --> 00:00:32,560
who I am,

13
00:00:33,799 --> 00:00:36,080
don't blame me for showing you no mercy.

14
00:00:37,040 --> 00:00:38,639
Come in.

15
00:00:42,319 --> 00:00:43,479
Come in now!

16
00:00:45,759 --> 00:00:47,400
I'm afraid Your Highness won't see

17
00:00:47,520 --> 00:00:48,639
the person you're waiting for.

18
00:00:50,200 --> 00:00:51,639
However,

19
00:00:52,479 --> 00:00:54,040
the tea does taste quite different.

20
00:00:56,319 --> 00:00:57,520
You're not as good

21
00:00:57,520 --> 00:00:58,919
as someone I know

22
00:00:58,919 --> 00:01:00,680
at spiking drinks.

23
00:01:04,160 --> 00:01:04,839
Zhao Tie.

24
00:01:04,839 --> 00:01:05,599
Yes.

25
00:01:09,680 --> 00:01:10,480
Your Highness.

26
00:01:10,480 --> 00:01:11,519
I've completed the task

27
00:01:11,519 --> 00:01:12,599
I was assigned with.

28
00:01:14,400 --> 00:01:16,160
According to the original storyline,

29
00:01:16,160 --> 00:01:17,559
I would catch them

30
00:01:17,559 --> 00:01:19,279
at Shuixie Pavilion.

31
00:01:19,800 --> 00:01:21,120
I didn't see this coming.

32
00:01:21,120 --> 00:01:22,440
After so many twists and turns,

33
00:01:22,959 --> 00:01:24,680
we still end up following
the original storyline.

34
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:31,800
Wait a minute.

35
00:01:32,440 --> 00:01:33,680
I'm going to catch my cheating spouse.

36
00:01:33,680 --> 00:01:36,400
I need to look menacing.

37
00:01:46,360 --> 00:01:47,440
How dare the two of you do this

38
00:01:47,440 --> 00:01:48,480
under broad daylight?

39
00:01:48,639 --> 00:01:51,040
Come out now, adulterers!

40
00:02:14,880 --> 00:02:15,440
Why

41
00:02:15,440 --> 00:02:16,199
are you

42
00:02:16,199 --> 00:02:17,000
on your knees?

43
00:02:26,839 --> 00:02:28,000
My goodness.

44
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:29,440
I'm done for.

45
00:02:30,520 --> 00:02:31,960
I thought I could set him up
in a badger game.

46
00:02:31,960 --> 00:02:34,199
How did it end up
with her being tortured?

47
00:02:35,320 --> 00:02:37,199
The princess of Beiqing
has been arrested now.

48
00:02:37,600 --> 00:02:39,520
We still need her
for the remaining story.

49
00:02:40,880 --> 00:02:42,720
The plot has changed completely.

50
00:02:42,720 --> 00:02:44,720
What should I do now?

51
00:02:51,839 --> 00:02:52,639
I can't let this happen.

52
00:02:54,039 --> 00:02:55,720
There must be something wrong with this.

53
00:02:56,800 --> 00:02:57,880
I shall find it out myself.

54
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:08,000
Can you say it now?

55
00:03:08,320 --> 00:03:10,800
I admit my defeat

56
00:03:10,800 --> 00:03:12,240
and I surrender to Your Highness.

57
00:03:12,639 --> 00:03:14,520
Your Highness is a dignified man.

58
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:18,000
Do you really want to do this
to a helpless lady like me?

59
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:19,000
Our countries are at war.

60
00:03:19,240 --> 00:03:20,199
Our genders don't matter now,

61
00:03:20,199 --> 00:03:21,240
but our nationalities do.

62
00:03:21,600 --> 00:03:24,080
If I take pity on you,
even only for a little,

63
00:03:24,080 --> 00:03:27,000
I will be betraying the troops of Sheng.

64
00:03:27,399 --> 00:03:28,479
What do you think

65
00:03:28,720 --> 00:03:29,880
I should do?

66
00:03:29,880 --> 00:03:30,440
I...

67
00:03:31,720 --> 00:03:33,559
I am the princess of Beiqing.

68
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:35,000
According to diplomatic etiquette,

69
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:36,520
I shouldn't be treated this way.

70
00:03:36,880 --> 00:03:38,919
The embassy of Beiqing
will be meeting the Emperor soon.

71
00:03:38,919 --> 00:03:40,520
Let's see how you shall explain this.

72
00:03:40,839 --> 00:03:42,240
I didn't find your name, Shangguan Ruyu,

73
00:03:42,639 --> 00:03:44,199
on the list of envoys
who're going to visit the Capital.

74
00:03:45,119 --> 00:03:46,399
Since your name is not on the list,

75
00:03:46,679 --> 00:03:48,440
I simply arrested a suspect.

76
00:03:48,639 --> 00:03:50,000
There's no need to explain the arrest
to our guests.

77
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:50,520
You...

78
00:03:52,119 --> 00:03:53,360
You've caught all the spies

79
00:03:53,360 --> 00:03:54,800
I planted in the Capital.

80
00:03:55,440 --> 00:03:57,279
You also saw through my scheme.

81
00:03:57,559 --> 00:03:59,800
What else do you want from me?

82
00:04:01,600 --> 00:04:02,839
Why are you asking the question
when you already know the answer?

83
00:04:04,119 --> 00:04:06,639
I really have no idea
who "Yuan Ju Qing" is.

84
00:04:06,720 --> 00:04:08,800
I have completely no idea!

85
00:04:12,279 --> 00:04:12,839
Your Highness.

86
00:04:12,839 --> 00:04:13,639
Let me try.

87
00:04:24,600 --> 00:04:25,320
Your Highness.

88
00:04:25,839 --> 00:04:27,040
Look.

89
00:04:27,200 --> 00:04:29,040
You're the princess.

90
00:04:29,040 --> 00:04:30,079
You don't have to suffer like this.

91
00:04:30,200 --> 00:04:31,320
Just tell us now.

92
00:04:31,399 --> 00:04:33,559
What do I do when I really don't know
who the person is?

93
00:04:34,559 --> 00:04:35,760
Who are you?

94
00:04:36,320 --> 00:04:39,200
You're in no place to talk to me.

95
00:04:39,440 --> 00:04:40,559
Get on your knees now!

96
00:04:50,640 --> 00:04:51,320
Then...

97
00:04:51,480 --> 00:04:52,760
You have to tell me the truth

98
00:04:52,880 --> 00:04:54,279
if I get on my knees.

99
00:05:03,119 --> 00:05:04,519
Just tell me the truth.

100
00:05:06,640 --> 00:05:07,440
Go away!

101
00:05:11,079 --> 00:05:12,119
Stop staring at me.

102
00:05:12,359 --> 00:05:13,760
Or I'll dig out your eyeballs

103
00:05:13,760 --> 00:05:15,200
and feed the dogs with them.

104
00:05:16,239 --> 00:05:17,079
Go away now!

105
00:05:17,640 --> 00:05:18,359
What a shrew.

106
00:05:20,200 --> 00:05:20,920
Close the door.

107
00:05:26,040 --> 00:05:26,839
Your Highness.

108
00:05:28,359 --> 00:05:29,079
I didn't expect

109
00:05:29,079 --> 00:05:30,760
the princess of Beiqing

110
00:05:30,760 --> 00:05:32,160
to be such an aggressive woman.

111
00:05:33,320 --> 00:05:34,920
She would rather die

112
00:05:35,760 --> 00:05:36,839
than tell me information
regarding "Yuan Ju Qing".

113
00:05:37,640 --> 00:05:38,880
The more she resists it,

114
00:05:39,239 --> 00:05:41,600
the more it shows
how important the person is.

115
00:05:41,720 --> 00:05:43,679
Even the princess is trying
to help him hide his identity.

116
00:05:44,279 --> 00:05:45,399
It's a pity that my ability

117
00:05:45,399 --> 00:05:46,480
doesn't work on others.

118
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:48,519
I can't read her mind.

119
00:05:49,200 --> 00:05:50,079
Then...

120
00:05:50,359 --> 00:05:51,239
Why don't we

121
00:05:51,399 --> 00:05:52,839
try it on Her Highness again?

122
00:05:56,119 --> 00:05:57,320
That's the only thing we can do now.

123
00:07:15,640 --> 00:07:16,760
"Yuan Ju Qing"?

124
00:07:16,880 --> 00:07:18,519
He doesn't sound like a good man.

125
00:07:20,559 --> 00:07:21,480
Wait.

126
00:07:21,480 --> 00:07:22,799
Why does it

127
00:07:23,079 --> 00:07:24,679
sound so familiar?

128
00:07:26,279 --> 00:07:27,600
"Yuan Ju Qing"?

129
00:07:28,480 --> 00:07:30,119
"Yuan Ju Qing".

130
00:07:30,679 --> 00:07:32,359
"Yuan Ju Qing".

131
00:07:34,760 --> 00:07:35,559
Wait.

132
00:07:38,959 --> 00:07:40,160
The original storyline!
