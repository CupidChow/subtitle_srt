2
00:00:09,039 --> 00:00:10,319
It's been so long
since your last visit.

3
00:00:10,439 --> 00:00:11,960
I almost couldn't recognize you.

4
00:00:12,359 --> 00:00:13,199
Yes.

5
00:00:20,559 --> 00:00:21,440
Fifth Brother.

6
00:00:21,760 --> 00:00:22,639
What brings you here

7
00:00:23,440 --> 00:00:24,360
all of a sudden?

8
00:00:25,280 --> 00:00:27,479
Fourth Brother hasn't left
your wife and your residence

9
00:00:27,680 --> 00:00:28,559
since your wedding day.

10
00:00:28,959 --> 00:00:31,120
I miss you a lot.

11
00:00:31,680 --> 00:00:32,880
So I decided to pay you a visit.

12
00:00:33,400 --> 00:00:35,279
I brought a gift
for my sister-in-law too.

13
00:00:35,720 --> 00:00:37,720
It's just a little something from me.

14
00:00:38,400 --> 00:00:39,279
Thank you

15
00:00:39,279 --> 00:00:40,240
in advance.

16
00:00:40,400 --> 00:00:41,279
We're brothers.

17
00:00:41,400 --> 00:00:42,720
You're welcome.

18
00:00:44,680 --> 00:00:45,240
By the way,

19
00:00:46,279 --> 00:00:47,560
I heard that
there is some progress

20
00:00:48,639 --> 00:00:50,439
in the Capital corruption case

21
00:00:51,159 --> 00:00:51,959
Fourth Brother is currently working on.

22
00:00:52,720 --> 00:00:53,400
Why?

23
00:00:53,840 --> 00:00:55,360
Is Fifth Brother interested

24
00:00:55,360 --> 00:00:56,200
in this case?

25
00:00:57,959 --> 00:00:59,840
Fourth Brother has always been
an impartial law enforcer.

26
00:00:59,959 --> 00:01:01,040
You hate law-breakers.

27
00:01:01,240 --> 00:01:02,720
As your younger brother,
I admire you a lot.

28
00:01:04,080 --> 00:01:04,919
However,

29
00:01:05,120 --> 00:01:06,879
I have some advice for you.

30
00:01:08,040 --> 00:01:09,199
Sometimes,

31
00:01:09,599 --> 00:01:10,839
we need to know

32
00:01:10,839 --> 00:01:12,879
when to stop.

33
00:01:13,760 --> 00:01:15,160
If you do more than you should,

34
00:01:15,599 --> 00:01:16,919
you'll affect the operation
of the imperial court.

35
00:01:17,160 --> 00:01:19,199
That won't do any good
to both the country and yourself.

36
00:01:20,599 --> 00:01:22,519
Then, those corrupted officials
might think they're above laws.

37
00:01:22,760 --> 00:01:23,919
They made an unforgivable mistake.

38
00:01:24,440 --> 00:01:26,000
We're neglecting the people
of the country

39
00:01:26,279 --> 00:01:28,959
if we don't be strict with them.

40
00:01:29,680 --> 00:01:30,959
Fifth Brother, as the Prince,

41
00:01:31,360 --> 00:01:33,680
you shouldn't have said those words.

42
00:01:35,879 --> 00:01:36,680
Fourth Brother,

43
00:01:37,919 --> 00:01:40,400
sometimes the pond is deeper
than you think.

44
00:01:41,279 --> 00:01:42,639
Insisting on diving to the bottom

45
00:01:43,720 --> 00:01:45,360
might cost you your life too.

46
00:01:47,199 --> 00:01:48,519
Don't worry, Fifth Brother.

47
00:01:51,239 --> 00:01:52,559
However deep the pond is,

48
00:01:52,800 --> 00:01:54,279
it's still just a pond.

49
00:01:55,040 --> 00:01:56,199
I only need to put
a little more effort into it

50
00:01:56,199 --> 00:01:58,040
to be able to find the truth.

51
00:01:59,160 --> 00:02:02,040
I'm afraid that all the living creatures
in the pond

52
00:02:02,239 --> 00:02:03,919
might not be able to hide themselves
any longer.

53
00:02:05,519 --> 00:02:06,559
What do you think, Fifth Brother?

54
00:02:11,800 --> 00:02:12,279
Your Highness.

55
00:02:12,960 --> 00:02:14,639
It seems like
Prince Rui is hiding Mr. Xu.

56
00:02:14,800 --> 00:02:15,839
We can't find him at all.

57
00:02:18,919 --> 00:02:20,440
I'm not worried about the witness,

58
00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:21,960
but we need to destroy

59
00:02:22,559 --> 00:02:23,399
the ledger.

60
00:02:23,759 --> 00:02:25,199
Prince Rui won't even go soft
on his own family member.

61
00:02:25,199 --> 00:02:26,000
Nothing can sway him.

62
00:02:26,279 --> 00:02:27,039
Your Highness,

63
00:02:27,039 --> 00:02:28,160
do you have any other ideas?

64
00:02:28,520 --> 00:02:29,600
Although we can't
convince Fourth Brother,

65
00:02:30,279 --> 00:02:32,360
we haven't spoken to
Fourth Sister-in-law yet.

66
00:02:53,720 --> 00:02:54,600
I'm Qin Yu. Nice to meet you,

67
00:02:54,960 --> 00:02:55,919
Fourth Sister-in-law.

68
00:02:58,039 --> 00:02:59,080
Qin Yu?

69
00:03:00,520 --> 00:03:01,479
Prince Tan?

70
00:03:01,479 --> 00:03:02,320
That's me.

71
00:03:03,160 --> 00:03:05,199
(Qin Yu, Prince Tan, is a cunning man.)

72
00:03:05,839 --> 00:03:07,240
(He's the mastermind
behind the corruption case)

73
00:03:07,240 --> 00:03:08,399
(Qin Chuan is working on.)

74
00:03:08,720 --> 00:03:10,160
(To obstruct Qin Chuan's investigation,)

75
00:03:10,160 --> 00:03:11,600
(he uses Mu Xiaoxi as his pawn.)

76
00:03:12,320 --> 00:03:13,520
(But I'm the author.)

77
00:03:13,520 --> 00:03:14,720
(Of course, I don't fear him.)

78
00:03:14,919 --> 00:03:16,000
It's

79
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:17,399
Prince Tan.

80
00:03:18,080 --> 00:03:19,039
Nice to meet you.

81
00:03:19,639 --> 00:03:22,039
I've long heard
about my sister-in-law's beauty.

82
00:03:22,160 --> 00:03:23,279
I finally get to meet you today

83
00:03:23,479 --> 00:03:24,880
and the rumor is certainly true.

84
00:03:25,240 --> 00:03:26,639
I'm flattered.

85
00:03:26,679 --> 00:03:29,199
Your Highness looks
like a hypocrite too.

86
00:03:30,479 --> 00:03:32,479
A handsome man...

87
00:03:33,119 --> 00:03:35,000
Sister-in-law, the entire Capital knows

88
00:03:35,479 --> 00:03:36,679
how much you love my Fourth Brother.

89
00:03:36,800 --> 00:03:38,559
I would like to send
my heartiest congratulations

90
00:03:39,080 --> 00:03:40,720
for your wedding.

91
00:03:41,119 --> 00:03:42,559
However,

92
00:03:42,559 --> 00:03:44,440
I heard that Fourth Brother

93
00:03:44,440 --> 00:03:46,160
hasn't spent much time
with Sister-in-law.

94
00:03:47,440 --> 00:03:47,960
Sigh.

95
00:03:48,199 --> 00:03:50,199
We're married.

96
00:03:50,199 --> 00:03:51,520
I have no choice but to live with that.

97
00:03:51,800 --> 00:03:52,800
Moreover,

98
00:03:52,800 --> 00:03:54,160
it was His Majesty
who granted us this marriage.

99
00:03:54,360 --> 00:03:55,600
How can I divorce him?

100
00:03:57,600 --> 00:03:58,759
Sister-in-law,

101
00:03:59,080 --> 00:04:00,160
you don't have to pretend
that everything is all right.

102
00:04:00,720 --> 00:04:01,600
I happen

103
00:04:01,600 --> 00:04:03,279
to have this amazing drug.

104
00:04:04,559 --> 00:04:06,119
It's called the Lover's Water.

105
00:04:06,440 --> 00:04:07,919
You only need to feed
Fourth Brother with this,

106
00:04:08,479 --> 00:04:10,080
he will immediately

107
00:04:10,080 --> 00:04:11,399
fall head over heels for you

108
00:04:11,399 --> 00:04:13,080
and be loyal to you forever.

109
00:04:13,399 --> 00:04:14,199
What do you think?

110
00:04:14,839 --> 00:04:15,960
Does Sister-in-law want to try it out?

111
00:04:16,239 --> 00:04:18,160
You only need to do me a small favor,

112
00:04:18,600 --> 00:04:19,480
and I'll give

113
00:04:19,480 --> 00:04:20,600
this Lover's Water to you for free.

114
00:04:22,200 --> 00:04:22,760
Your Highness.

115
00:04:22,959 --> 00:04:24,359
You can keep

116
00:04:24,559 --> 00:04:26,480
this precious item to yourself.

117
00:04:26,480 --> 00:04:27,079
Xiu'er.

118
00:04:27,079 --> 00:04:27,839
Let's go.

119
00:04:41,640 --> 00:04:43,959
You've triggered the second mission.

120
00:04:44,239 --> 00:04:45,440
Your task

121
00:04:45,880 --> 00:04:48,920
is to form an alliance
with Qin Yu, Prince Tan.

122
00:04:49,519 --> 00:04:50,559
Details of the mission.

123
00:04:51,040 --> 00:04:53,119
Agree to form an alliance with Qin Yu

124
00:04:53,279 --> 00:04:54,440
and fulfill

125
00:04:54,440 --> 00:04:56,160
all his requests.

126
00:04:56,160 --> 00:04:58,679
If you fail to complete your tasks
within three days,

127
00:04:59,519 --> 00:05:01,399
the mission will be considered failed.

128
00:05:04,239 --> 00:05:05,000
Oh, heck.

129
00:05:05,720 --> 00:05:07,279
How could the new mission come now?

130
00:05:10,760 --> 00:05:11,559
Fifth Brother.

131
00:05:13,359 --> 00:05:14,640
The Lover's Water is so precious.

132
00:05:14,640 --> 00:05:15,320
I want it.

133
00:05:15,320 --> 00:05:15,760
Tell me.

134
00:05:15,760 --> 00:05:16,679
What do I have to do?

135
00:05:17,920 --> 00:05:19,040
Sister-in-law,

136
00:05:19,040 --> 00:05:20,119
are you sure?

137
00:05:20,119 --> 00:05:20,600
Yes.

138
00:05:20,600 --> 00:05:22,040
Why would anyone not want this?

139
00:05:24,559 --> 00:05:26,720
I only have a few requests.

140
00:05:27,399 --> 00:05:29,160
If Sister-in-law can steal the ledger

141
00:05:29,239 --> 00:05:31,359
from the corruption case
from Fourth Brother,

142
00:05:31,519 --> 00:05:32,640
you can have

143
00:05:32,640 --> 00:05:33,679
the Lover's Water.

144
00:05:33,679 --> 00:05:34,480
Deal.

145
00:05:36,119 --> 00:05:36,920
So...

146
00:05:38,119 --> 00:05:38,959
I look forward to working with you.

147
00:05:39,559 --> 00:05:40,440
Me too.

148
00:05:47,640 --> 00:05:48,600
What a foolish woman.

149
00:05:49,440 --> 00:05:50,359
What a fool.
