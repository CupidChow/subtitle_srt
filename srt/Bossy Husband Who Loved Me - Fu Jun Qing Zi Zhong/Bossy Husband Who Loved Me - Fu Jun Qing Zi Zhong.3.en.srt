2
00:00:08,439 --> 00:00:09,960
Congratulations.
You've completed the mission.

3
00:00:09,960 --> 00:00:11,960
You earned a Returning Piece.

4
00:00:19,479 --> 00:00:21,479
It's so easy to earn
a Back-to-city Piece.

5
00:00:21,959 --> 00:00:23,639
It seems like

6
00:00:23,920 --> 00:00:25,000
it won't be too difficult
to collect all 10 pieces after all.

7
00:00:25,799 --> 00:00:27,559
When are we going to start
the next mission?

8
00:00:27,799 --> 00:00:29,840
New missions will pop up randomly

9
00:00:30,159 --> 00:00:32,439
following the progression of the plot.

10
00:00:32,439 --> 00:00:34,240
Go and get ready now.

11
00:00:38,520 --> 00:00:39,400
Bring me some water.

12
00:00:40,240 --> 00:00:40,759
Your Highness.

13
00:00:40,759 --> 00:00:41,479
Stop gargling.

14
00:00:41,840 --> 00:00:43,799
This is the eighth time
I'm bringing you water.

15
00:00:48,840 --> 00:00:49,759
How can that woman

16
00:00:50,520 --> 00:00:51,720
be so shameless

17
00:00:52,560 --> 00:00:53,599
and brazen?

18
00:00:54,040 --> 00:00:55,000
I need to teach her a lesson.

19
00:00:55,400 --> 00:00:56,759
Otherwise, she'll act more unruly
in the future.

20
00:00:58,880 --> 00:00:59,680
Your Highness.

21
00:00:59,880 --> 00:01:00,840
The palace has sent an envoy here.

22
00:01:01,240 --> 00:01:02,759
His Majesty has sent
Your Highnesses breakfast.

23
00:01:03,479 --> 00:01:04,599
Since it's a gift from His Majesty,

24
00:01:05,120 --> 00:01:06,639
bring the woman here
to have her breakfast.

25
00:01:07,639 --> 00:01:08,120
Yes, Your Highness.

26
00:01:10,360 --> 00:01:13,160
(I want to say thank you.)

27
00:01:13,160 --> 00:01:14,959
(You bring warmth)

28
00:01:14,959 --> 00:01:16,919
(in every season.)

29
00:01:17,519 --> 00:01:18,519
Don't talk
while you're sleeping and eating.

30
00:01:19,160 --> 00:01:19,959
Have you not learned that before?

31
00:01:20,959 --> 00:01:21,959
What nonsense.

32
00:01:22,959 --> 00:01:24,080
I wasn't talking.

33
00:01:27,199 --> 00:01:28,440
You are being ridiculous.

34
00:01:36,480 --> 00:01:37,720
(Do you think you're the only one
who knows manners?)

35
00:01:38,120 --> 00:01:39,239
(No matter how knowledgeable you are,)

36
00:01:39,239 --> 00:01:41,559
(you fell into my trap yesterday
nonetheless.)

37
00:01:44,800 --> 00:01:46,040
How dare you bring it up?

38
00:01:56,480 --> 00:01:57,080
Hey.

39
00:01:57,519 --> 00:01:58,720
No one was talking.

40
00:01:59,279 --> 00:02:00,160
Your Highness.

41
00:02:00,160 --> 00:02:02,319
It's true that Her Highness
wasn't speaking.

42
00:02:17,800 --> 00:02:20,839
The meal from the palace
tastes pretty decent.

43
00:02:21,160 --> 00:02:23,759
But this long face before me
is making me lose all my appetite.

44
00:02:28,600 --> 00:02:29,440
What are you doing?

45
00:02:30,720 --> 00:02:31,679
Eat.

46
00:02:34,679 --> 00:02:35,440
I'm full.

47
00:02:35,559 --> 00:02:36,679
What a short temper.

48
00:02:40,639 --> 00:02:41,520
What a sore loser.

49
00:02:46,440 --> 00:02:48,160
Is it true that
the woman didn't say anything just now?

50
00:02:48,559 --> 00:02:50,000
Yes, she didn't.

51
00:02:52,080 --> 00:02:53,839
But I heard her very clearly.

52
00:02:54,320 --> 00:02:55,520
What's going on?

53
00:03:01,479 --> 00:03:02,119
Your Highness.

54
00:03:03,600 --> 00:03:04,279
Your Highness.

55
00:03:09,639 --> 00:03:11,080
Are you feeling sick?

56
00:03:11,080 --> 00:03:12,800
Should I bring
the imperial physician here?

57
00:03:13,199 --> 00:03:13,679
It's fine.

58
00:03:14,399 --> 00:03:15,199
I'm all right.

59
00:03:16,720 --> 00:03:17,320
Your Highness.

60
00:03:17,559 --> 00:03:18,960
I received news just now.

61
00:03:19,279 --> 00:03:20,240
They've helped the witness
of the corruption case

62
00:03:20,399 --> 00:03:22,240
settle down at a secret location
outside the capital.

63
00:03:22,479 --> 00:03:24,240
He insists on meeting you in person

64
00:03:24,240 --> 00:03:25,600
before he'll hand out the key evidence.

65
00:03:27,119 --> 00:03:28,240
This is a major case

66
00:03:28,559 --> 00:03:30,080
and it involves many powerful people
of the imperial court.

67
00:03:30,479 --> 00:03:31,880
I must meet him in person.

68
00:03:32,839 --> 00:03:35,160
Many people have been watching
the Prince's Residence lately.

69
00:03:35,559 --> 00:03:36,880
You must be very careful,
Your Highness.

70
00:03:38,960 --> 00:03:40,639
We are visiting the bride's parents
tomorrow.

71
00:03:40,639 --> 00:03:42,119
We can use the opportunity
to cover up our route.

72
00:03:48,600 --> 00:03:51,440
(Mu's Residence)

73
00:03:51,440 --> 00:03:52,199
Father-in-law. Mother-in-law.

74
00:03:53,160 --> 00:03:54,320
You're being too nice, Your Highness.

75
00:03:54,320 --> 00:03:55,320
Xiaoxi is home.

76
00:03:55,759 --> 00:03:56,360
Mom.

77
00:03:56,600 --> 00:03:57,559
It's been a few days since your wedding.

78
00:03:57,559 --> 00:03:59,399
How do Your Highness and Xiaoxi
find staying together?

79
00:04:02,800 --> 00:04:03,600
It's not bad.

80
00:04:05,839 --> 00:04:07,279
My daughter

81
00:04:07,360 --> 00:04:08,600
is spoiled

82
00:04:08,679 --> 00:04:09,759
and arrogant.

83
00:04:10,119 --> 00:04:11,600
She's so different

84
00:04:12,479 --> 00:04:13,919
from her mom.

85
00:04:14,279 --> 00:04:15,960
Look at how knowledgeable
and understanding her mom is.

86
00:04:15,960 --> 00:04:17,200
Look at my daughter.

87
00:04:18,359 --> 00:04:19,600
Your Highness.

88
00:04:19,880 --> 00:04:20,880
Please take good care of her

89
00:04:21,239 --> 00:04:22,040
in the future.

90
00:04:22,480 --> 00:04:23,279
Please take good care of her.

91
00:04:24,480 --> 00:04:25,320
You're too humble, Father-in-law.

92
00:04:25,679 --> 00:04:27,720
You have contributed a lot
to our nation.

93
00:04:27,720 --> 00:04:28,760
You spent half your lifetime
on the battlefield.

94
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:30,079
For you,

95
00:04:30,519 --> 00:04:32,079
I'll definitely be nice to her.

96
00:04:33,679 --> 00:04:34,399
Yes.

97
00:04:34,559 --> 00:04:38,559
(You brought archers, lassoers, and
Knock-out Drugs on our wedding night.)

98
00:04:38,640 --> 00:04:40,279
That was really nice of you.

99
00:04:42,799 --> 00:04:43,920
Be careful what you say

100
00:04:44,119 --> 00:04:45,640
in front of the elders.

101
00:04:45,640 --> 00:04:46,760
I didn't say anything.

102
00:04:52,160 --> 00:04:54,160
Why don't you donate your ears

103
00:04:54,160 --> 00:04:55,440
to those in need
if you're not going to use them?

104
00:04:55,679 --> 00:04:56,440
Xiaoxi.

105
00:04:57,720 --> 00:04:58,440
This...

106
00:04:58,440 --> 00:04:59,200
To be honest,

107
00:04:59,480 --> 00:05:00,959
my wife and I met

108
00:05:01,679 --> 00:05:03,119
through an arranged marriage too.

109
00:05:04,200 --> 00:05:06,720
At that moment,

110
00:05:07,679 --> 00:05:08,799
I was quite surprised.

111
00:05:09,640 --> 00:05:10,359
I was very surprised.

112
00:05:10,600 --> 00:05:12,000
I was taken by surprise.

113
00:05:12,880 --> 00:05:15,000
But as time went by,

114
00:05:15,239 --> 00:05:17,040
we started to grow feelings
for each other,

115
00:05:17,239 --> 00:05:19,079
and our bond got stronger and stronger.

116
00:05:21,839 --> 00:05:24,000
Let's go in.

117
00:05:24,600 --> 00:05:25,760
We've prepared a feast.

118
00:05:25,760 --> 00:05:27,079
This way, please, Your Highness.

119
00:05:27,600 --> 00:05:28,399
Yes.

120
00:05:28,880 --> 00:05:29,480
Here.

121
00:05:30,040 --> 00:05:30,480
This way, please.

122
00:05:48,880 --> 00:05:49,359
Your Highness.

123
00:05:50,880 --> 00:05:52,559
We've prepared the clothes.

124
00:05:53,200 --> 00:05:55,399
The horse is awaiting you
at the city gate too.

125
00:05:56,880 --> 00:05:58,000
Thanks, Father-in-law.

126
00:05:58,160 --> 00:05:59,839
Your Highness is working
on the corruption case.

127
00:05:59,839 --> 00:06:01,399
This is for the country.

128
00:06:01,959 --> 00:06:04,320
Of course, I should do all I can
to assist you.

129
00:06:10,839 --> 00:06:11,559
Dad.

130
00:06:17,440 --> 00:06:18,559
What are you doing out here?

131
00:06:19,480 --> 00:06:21,600
Your Highness is schooling his servant.

132
00:06:24,440 --> 00:06:25,600
Go.

133
00:06:25,959 --> 00:06:26,920
Go to your mom.

134
00:06:28,760 --> 00:06:31,399
I was just there with Mom.

135
00:06:31,399 --> 00:06:33,799
You have no idea
how much she's suffering.

136
00:06:33,799 --> 00:06:35,000
She has gone to the washroom
eight times

137
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:36,799
during the past two hours.

138
00:06:37,679 --> 00:06:39,799
What do we do now?

139
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:41,839
Father-in-law.

140
00:06:41,839 --> 00:06:43,040
Why don't you go and
check on Mother-in-law?

141
00:06:43,119 --> 00:06:43,720
Sure.

142
00:06:43,720 --> 00:06:44,760
I'll be right back.

143
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:50,359
Schooling your servant?

144
00:06:50,359 --> 00:06:50,959
Do you think I'll believe you?

145
00:06:56,480 --> 00:06:57,959
According to the original storyline,

146
00:06:57,959 --> 00:06:59,880
this was when Qin Chuan put on
his disguise

147
00:06:59,880 --> 00:07:01,160
and would be on his way to meet
the witness of the corruption case.

148
00:07:01,160 --> 00:07:02,079
Shopkeeper Xu.

149
00:07:07,880 --> 00:07:09,440
After you said
"do you think I'll believe you?",

150
00:07:10,519 --> 00:07:11,720
you didn't say anything else, right?

151
00:07:12,119 --> 00:07:13,160
Of course, not.

152
00:07:13,359 --> 00:07:14,799
You're too young

153
00:07:15,119 --> 00:07:17,119
to lose your hearing.

154
00:07:21,440 --> 00:07:22,440
I have an important business
to attend to today.

155
00:07:22,920 --> 00:07:24,760
I'll bring you back to the residence
when I'm done with my errand.

156
00:07:25,040 --> 00:07:26,000
Stay at home.

157
00:07:26,640 --> 00:07:27,720
Oh.

158
00:07:28,760 --> 00:07:30,959
(Sigh. Qin Chuan, the poor guy.)

159
00:07:31,320 --> 00:07:33,000
(He still has no idea
what's awaiting him.)

160
00:07:33,239 --> 00:07:35,160
The sky might be clear now,

161
00:07:35,480 --> 00:07:36,119
but

162
00:07:36,119 --> 00:07:37,839
when he meets Shopkeeper Xu later,

163
00:07:38,160 --> 00:07:38,760
there will be

164
00:07:38,760 --> 00:07:39,799
an unexpected heavy rainfall.

165
00:07:40,480 --> 00:07:42,480
Shopkeeper Xu will excuse himself
to the washroom,

166
00:07:42,799 --> 00:07:43,559
but what they don't foresee
