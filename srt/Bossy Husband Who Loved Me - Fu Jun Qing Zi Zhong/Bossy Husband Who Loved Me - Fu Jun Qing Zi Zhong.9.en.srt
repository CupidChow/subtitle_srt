2
00:00:12,479 --> 00:00:12,880
This...

3
00:00:16,040 --> 00:00:18,200
Why is this gecko cinnabar still here?

4
00:00:18,440 --> 00:00:19,719
Anyway,

5
00:00:19,959 --> 00:00:21,520
I'm totally fine.

6
00:00:22,040 --> 00:00:24,280
However, whether
someone has a health problem,

7
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:26,280
I dare not say

8
00:00:26,280 --> 00:00:27,280
and ask.

9
00:00:27,760 --> 00:00:28,840
This is a misunderstanding.

10
00:00:30,479 --> 00:00:31,760
It's not like what you thought.

11
00:00:31,760 --> 00:00:32,799
Your Highness,
you don't have to be awkward.

12
00:00:33,439 --> 00:00:34,200
Um...

13
00:00:34,200 --> 00:00:35,959
During the first intercourse,

14
00:00:36,520 --> 00:00:37,439
since you have no experience,

15
00:00:37,799 --> 00:00:38,799
it's normal

16
00:00:39,319 --> 00:00:40,520
when things go wrong.

17
00:00:40,759 --> 00:00:41,680
Yes.

18
00:00:42,319 --> 00:00:44,240
My husband used to be like you.

19
00:00:45,279 --> 00:00:47,400
I was like that too.

20
00:00:48,279 --> 00:00:49,080
How can you say that?

21
00:00:56,200 --> 00:00:57,159
It's normal.

22
00:01:05,839 --> 00:01:07,519
Why don't you explain to them?

23
00:01:08,680 --> 00:01:11,199
I'm still a child.

24
00:01:11,519 --> 00:01:12,440
How should I explain?

25
00:01:39,599 --> 00:01:41,319
Rule number two,

26
00:01:41,319 --> 00:01:42,720
do not appear in front of me

27
00:01:42,720 --> 00:01:43,919
unless it's necessary.

28
00:02:00,120 --> 00:02:02,319
I wasn't very nice to you.

29
00:02:03,239 --> 00:02:04,480
My words were quite harsh.

30
00:02:04,720 --> 00:02:05,720
I think

31
00:02:05,959 --> 00:02:07,599
you won't mind.

32
00:02:07,680 --> 00:02:09,360
Do you think you can turn against me

33
00:02:09,559 --> 00:02:11,240
and ask me to forgive you as you wish?

34
00:02:11,440 --> 00:02:12,639
I

35
00:02:12,800 --> 00:02:13,800
won't.

36
00:02:22,080 --> 00:02:24,039
Why are you wandering in front of me?

37
00:02:25,800 --> 00:02:27,080
When you look at me,

38
00:02:27,559 --> 00:02:28,960
do you have any thoughts?

39
00:02:32,800 --> 00:02:33,600
Yes.

40
00:02:35,520 --> 00:02:36,800
What are you thinking?

41
00:02:39,559 --> 00:02:40,919
What I'm thinking is...

42
00:02:42,360 --> 00:02:43,399
Leave me alone.

43
00:02:44,880 --> 00:02:45,919
Did you really think that?

44
00:02:49,399 --> 00:02:51,039
Something is wrong with you,

45
00:02:51,039 --> 00:02:52,559
isn't it?

46
00:02:53,800 --> 00:02:55,520
You said that something
is wrong with me.

47
00:02:55,600 --> 00:02:56,240
Did you also think

48
00:02:56,240 --> 00:02:57,679
that something is wrong with me?

49
00:03:01,600 --> 00:03:02,919
It seems something is
really wrong with you.

50
00:03:04,160 --> 00:03:05,360
It's impossible.

51
00:03:07,160 --> 00:03:07,800
Are you sure

52
00:03:07,800 --> 00:03:09,240
you can't hear
Her Highness's thoughts anymore?

53
00:03:14,080 --> 00:03:15,960
I was with her face to face

54
00:03:16,240 --> 00:03:17,399
and I listened carefully,

55
00:03:17,759 --> 00:03:18,800
but I heard nothing.

56
00:03:19,479 --> 00:03:20,279
This ability

57
00:03:21,039 --> 00:03:22,240
appeared unexpectedly.

58
00:03:22,720 --> 00:03:23,440
Its disappearance

59
00:03:23,800 --> 00:03:24,800
is also so sudden.

60
00:03:26,919 --> 00:03:27,839
Your Highness,

61
00:03:28,240 --> 00:03:29,240
I think

62
00:03:29,720 --> 00:03:31,240
there must be some signs.

63
00:03:31,679 --> 00:03:32,800
Please recall carefully.

64
00:03:33,199 --> 00:03:35,039
When you first heard
Her Highness's inner thoughts,

65
00:03:35,479 --> 00:03:36,960
did anything special happen?

66
00:03:37,880 --> 00:03:39,600
I had body contact

67
00:03:39,600 --> 00:03:40,800
with her.

68
00:03:41,440 --> 00:03:42,360
Body contact?

69
00:03:43,119 --> 00:03:44,199
She held my hand.

70
00:03:44,880 --> 00:03:45,720
Held your hand?

71
00:03:46,399 --> 00:03:47,199
Like this?

72
00:03:57,520 --> 00:03:58,720
It should be like this.

73
00:03:58,960 --> 00:03:59,679
Like this?

74
00:04:00,839 --> 00:04:01,880
Can you hear anything?

75
00:04:08,119 --> 00:04:08,960
That isn't right.

76
00:04:10,520 --> 00:04:11,520
When she

77
00:04:12,600 --> 00:04:14,119
was holding my hand,

78
00:04:14,880 --> 00:04:16,079
she was sitting on the bed.

79
00:04:16,079 --> 00:04:16,959
I was standing

80
00:04:16,959 --> 00:04:18,000
beside the bed.

81
00:04:18,239 --> 00:04:19,239
The bed.

82
00:04:19,359 --> 00:04:20,119
Let's go.

83
00:04:20,239 --> 00:04:20,799
Hurry up.

84
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:21,559
Let's go.

85
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:33,799
Your Highness.

86
00:04:34,920 --> 00:04:35,640
Do you feel anything?

87
00:04:42,040 --> 00:04:42,920
No.

88
00:04:43,279 --> 00:04:44,040
I do.

89
00:04:46,200 --> 00:04:47,000
You do?

90
00:04:49,079 --> 00:04:50,119
My hands

91
00:04:50,119 --> 00:04:51,399
are getting numb.

92
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:54,920
Your Highness.

93
00:05:02,440 --> 00:05:03,679
I just made some refreshments.

94
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:04,720
Please have some.

95
00:05:07,359 --> 00:05:08,600
You are...

96
00:05:08,880 --> 00:05:09,640
We... We...

97
00:05:09,640 --> 00:05:11,239
We are practicing kung fu.

98
00:05:13,519 --> 00:05:14,480
Must you hold his hands?

99
00:05:14,640 --> 00:05:15,480
Yes.

100
00:05:15,720 --> 00:05:16,480
It's a unique skill.

101
00:05:17,399 --> 00:05:18,079
Okay.

102
00:05:20,160 --> 00:05:21,160
Please carry on.

103
00:05:21,760 --> 00:05:22,320
Carry on.

104
00:05:22,799 --> 00:05:23,480
Carry on.

105
00:05:36,839 --> 00:05:37,880
That was too much.

106
00:05:38,040 --> 00:05:40,040
I did that because of you.

107
00:05:41,559 --> 00:05:42,640
Let's try other ways.

108
00:05:43,320 --> 00:05:44,200
Please recall carefully.

109
00:05:44,679 --> 00:05:45,239
Is there

110
00:05:45,239 --> 00:05:46,519
any other special experience?

111
00:05:49,559 --> 00:05:50,600
Special experience?

112
00:05:54,480 --> 00:05:55,559
I drank the Knock-out Drug

113
00:05:57,200 --> 00:05:58,559
with her.

114
00:05:58,920 --> 00:05:59,880
Knock-out Drug?

115
00:06:17,440 --> 00:06:18,239
Your Highness.

116
00:06:18,720 --> 00:06:19,160
Cheers!

117
00:06:40,839 --> 00:06:41,519
Zhao Tie?

118
00:06:42,959 --> 00:06:43,799
Zhao Tie.
