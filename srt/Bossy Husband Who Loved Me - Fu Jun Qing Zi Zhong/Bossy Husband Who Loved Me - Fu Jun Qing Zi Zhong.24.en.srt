2
00:00:18,959 --> 00:00:19,840
Qin Chuan.

3
00:00:20,120 --> 00:00:21,239
What are you doing?

4
00:00:23,799 --> 00:00:24,920
Give it to me.

5
00:00:24,920 --> 00:00:26,440
Why are you drinking so much?

6
00:00:28,079 --> 00:00:29,319
You're here.

7
00:00:29,879 --> 00:00:31,440
I have something to ask you.

8
00:00:32,279 --> 00:00:33,119
Why?

9
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:35,279
You can't help

10
00:00:35,279 --> 00:00:37,919
but care for Shangguan Ruyu, right?

11
00:00:38,119 --> 00:00:39,119
Are you worried

12
00:00:39,680 --> 00:00:41,880
that she would expose
the guy behind this?

13
00:00:42,840 --> 00:00:43,840
The guy behind this?

14
00:00:44,360 --> 00:00:45,720
Who's the guy behind this?

15
00:00:45,840 --> 00:00:46,840
Are you still trying to hide it from me?

16
00:00:47,400 --> 00:00:48,840
I knew it.

17
00:00:52,279 --> 00:00:53,599
Is he good-looking?

18
00:00:56,119 --> 00:00:57,279
Who?

19
00:00:59,599 --> 00:01:00,880
It seems like

20
00:01:01,080 --> 00:01:02,840
he's quite handsome.

21
00:01:03,200 --> 00:01:04,000
Otherwise,

22
00:01:04,559 --> 00:01:07,519
Mu Xiaoxi wouldn't have done so much
for him.

23
00:01:10,919 --> 00:01:12,519
Stop playing the fool.

24
00:01:12,760 --> 00:01:14,279
I have found out

25
00:01:14,279 --> 00:01:16,040
everything.

26
00:01:16,040 --> 00:01:17,760
Your secret meeting place.

27
00:01:18,199 --> 00:01:20,599
Your token of love.

28
00:01:20,879 --> 00:01:22,959
"Aunt Flo" was the matchmaker.

29
00:01:22,959 --> 00:01:24,680
What are you talking about?

30
00:01:24,680 --> 00:01:26,959
Now I know why you agreed to the deal

31
00:01:26,959 --> 00:01:28,919
without a second thought.

32
00:01:30,360 --> 00:01:31,599
Apparently,

33
00:01:31,919 --> 00:01:34,160
you've always wanted

34
00:01:34,160 --> 00:01:36,360
to remain chaste for him.

35
00:01:37,760 --> 00:01:39,720
You don't want him
to get jealous, right?

36
00:01:40,199 --> 00:01:41,879
Who will get jealous?

37
00:01:41,879 --> 00:01:44,599
You're drunk.
I don't understand anything you said.

38
00:01:46,239 --> 00:01:47,879
You don't understand what I said?

39
00:01:47,879 --> 00:01:48,720
Fine.

40
00:01:51,040 --> 00:01:52,639
What I'm saying

41
00:01:53,199 --> 00:01:54,959
is that you, Mu Xiaoxi,

42
00:01:54,959 --> 00:01:56,519
are greedy

43
00:01:57,919 --> 00:01:59,400
and flirtatious.

44
00:01:59,400 --> 00:02:00,199
You

45
00:02:00,360 --> 00:02:01,720
want

46
00:02:02,480 --> 00:02:03,800
both men.

47
00:02:03,800 --> 00:02:05,040
What did you say?

48
00:02:05,040 --> 00:02:06,440
I'm flirtatious?

49
00:02:06,440 --> 00:02:07,559
Being drunk doesn't give you the right

50
00:02:07,559 --> 00:02:08,759
to accuse me.

51
00:02:08,759 --> 00:02:10,080
Who do you think you are?

52
00:02:12,839 --> 00:02:13,960
Who am I?

53
00:02:15,600 --> 00:02:17,199
Who am I?

54
00:02:19,720 --> 00:02:21,759
Who am I?

55
00:02:23,199 --> 00:02:25,279
I'm your husband.

56
00:02:25,279 --> 00:02:26,240
You're not.

57
00:02:26,479 --> 00:02:27,880
You're just my fake husband.

58
00:02:28,240 --> 00:02:28,800
You

59
00:02:28,800 --> 00:02:30,759
finally

60
00:02:30,759 --> 00:02:32,240
spoke your mind.

61
00:02:32,520 --> 00:02:34,399
From now on,

62
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:36,600
we will each

63
00:02:37,559 --> 00:02:39,520
mind our own businesses.

64
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:42,800
We'll go our separate ways.

65
00:02:45,240 --> 00:02:46,039
Sure.

66
00:02:46,880 --> 00:02:48,080
We're both cultured people.

67
00:02:48,600 --> 00:02:49,800
Let's do as you say.

68
00:02:50,559 --> 00:02:51,440
Let's part ways.

69
00:02:52,839 --> 00:02:54,160
Let's part ways.

70
00:03:16,759 --> 00:03:18,240
Prince Rui

71
00:03:18,559 --> 00:03:20,080
is a very good martial artist.

72
00:03:21,679 --> 00:03:23,119
They're here for me.

73
00:03:23,119 --> 00:03:23,919
Leave.

74
00:03:24,119 --> 00:03:25,279
But what about you?

75
00:03:25,919 --> 00:03:27,399
If you want to be spared,

76
00:03:27,399 --> 00:03:29,119
release our princess now.

77
00:03:29,759 --> 00:03:31,360
Come at me
if you think you are this good.

78
00:03:32,199 --> 00:03:33,000
Leave.

79
00:03:33,279 --> 00:03:34,880
Prince Rui is quite a stubborn man.

80
00:03:35,559 --> 00:03:36,399
Attack!

81
00:03:39,320 --> 00:03:40,119
Leave now!

82
00:04:04,399 --> 00:04:06,559
The assassins from Beiqing
are here for Qin Chuan.

83
00:04:06,639 --> 00:04:08,320
I'll only be a burden if I stay here.

84
00:04:08,559 --> 00:04:09,880
Qin Chuan is the protagonist
of the novel.

85
00:04:10,080 --> 00:04:11,080
He's unlucky,

86
00:04:11,080 --> 00:04:11,440
but

87
00:04:11,440 --> 00:04:12,479
he will not die.

88
00:04:15,279 --> 00:04:16,079
Wait.

89
00:04:16,959 --> 00:04:18,760
The plot has changed, right?

90
00:04:19,200 --> 00:04:20,119
What if...

91
00:04:24,440 --> 00:04:25,079
Move aside.

92
00:04:32,359 --> 00:04:33,279
Here comes someone and let's go.

Yes.

97
00:04:38,920 --> 00:04:39,519
