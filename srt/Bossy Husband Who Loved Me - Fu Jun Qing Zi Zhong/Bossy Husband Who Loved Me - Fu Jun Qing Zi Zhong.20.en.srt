2
00:00:18,159 --> 00:00:18,879
That's a good shot.

3
00:00:19,159 --> 00:00:20,040
The Sheng must be proud

4
00:00:20,040 --> 00:00:21,760
to have Your Highness as its heir.

5
00:00:23,879 --> 00:00:24,680
Miss Liu.

6
00:00:24,879 --> 00:00:25,719
Do you want me

7
00:00:27,719 --> 00:00:28,879
to teach you?

8
00:00:32,759 --> 00:00:33,599
What's wrong?

9
00:00:34,720 --> 00:00:36,639
Zhao Tie is as good an archer as I am.

10
00:00:36,799 --> 00:00:38,119
Does Miss Liu not want
to learn archery anymore?

11
00:00:38,200 --> 00:00:40,040
I know I have no talent in this.

12
00:00:40,360 --> 00:00:41,200
Perhaps

13
00:00:41,200 --> 00:00:42,400
I shouldn't trouble you further.

14
00:00:42,680 --> 00:00:44,439
I envy Her Highness

15
00:00:44,799 --> 00:00:46,479
for having a man like Your Highness

16
00:00:46,479 --> 00:00:47,479
caring for her

17
00:00:48,080 --> 00:00:49,560
and protecting her from all harm.

18
00:00:49,560 --> 00:00:51,479
That's why you get to live
such a happy life.

19
00:00:51,680 --> 00:00:53,200
I'm unlike Her Highness.

20
00:00:53,479 --> 00:00:54,279
But

21
00:00:55,040 --> 00:00:56,799
I feel sorry for Your Highness.

22
00:01:01,400 --> 00:01:02,560
We're a couple,

23
00:01:02,840 --> 00:01:04,680
so we should always support each other.

24
00:01:04,839 --> 00:01:07,199
You saw me teaching her archery

25
00:01:07,199 --> 00:01:07,959
and caring for her right now.

26
00:01:08,440 --> 00:01:10,199
But what you didn't see
was how she stood up for me

27
00:01:10,199 --> 00:01:11,879
when we were at the royal court.

28
00:01:12,080 --> 00:01:13,120
She put her life at stake,
trying to protect me.

29
00:01:14,040 --> 00:01:15,120
I think

30
00:01:15,319 --> 00:01:16,559
I owe her

31
00:01:16,680 --> 00:01:17,800
a lot.

32
00:01:27,040 --> 00:01:27,800
By the way,

33
00:01:29,879 --> 00:01:31,000
I forgot to ask you something.

34
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:32,400
How old is Miss Liu?

35
00:01:33,400 --> 00:01:35,000
I'm 22 years old this year.

36
00:01:35,080 --> 00:01:35,879
22 years old?

37
00:01:36,839 --> 00:01:37,800
Then,

38
00:01:38,080 --> 00:01:39,400
you're two years older
than Princess Consort.

39
00:01:39,959 --> 00:01:41,519
You were being too humble

40
00:01:41,720 --> 00:01:43,239
when you addressed her as Elder Sister.

41
00:01:50,239 --> 00:01:51,040
How dare he?

42
00:01:51,360 --> 00:01:52,879
I have a pretty face

43
00:01:53,040 --> 00:01:54,360
and I was offering myself to him.

44
00:01:54,720 --> 00:01:57,519
How could Qin Chuan stay unmoved?

45
00:01:57,959 --> 00:01:58,639
He is...

46
00:01:58,639 --> 00:01:59,879
He's toxic.

47
00:02:01,160 --> 00:02:02,800
He has rendered me speechless.

48
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:04,599
He never follows the storyline.

49
00:02:04,919 --> 00:02:07,279
The beautiful girl was standing
right before you.

50
00:02:07,279 --> 00:02:08,880
Why did you stick to me instead?

51
00:02:08,880 --> 00:02:10,479
However,

52
00:02:11,479 --> 00:02:14,199
Mu Xiaoxi did everything
just like how I planned it.

53
00:02:14,720 --> 00:02:16,039
She even followed my plans
several times.

54
00:02:16,240 --> 00:02:17,800
I almost thought

55
00:02:17,800 --> 00:02:19,440
she was helping me out voluntarily.

56
00:02:19,440 --> 00:02:20,679
Besides, I can't count on

57
00:02:20,679 --> 00:02:21,559
the princess of Beiqing either.

58
00:02:22,279 --> 00:02:24,080
She's supposed
to be a very cunning witch.

59
00:02:25,199 --> 00:02:26,639
I created so many opportunities for you,

60
00:02:26,639 --> 00:02:28,000
yet you grabbed none of them.

61
00:02:29,360 --> 00:02:30,880
- I need to figure out something else.
- I need to find another way.

62
00:02:33,039 --> 00:02:33,839
Your Highness.

63
00:02:34,039 --> 00:02:35,880
I've investigated it.

64
00:02:36,320 --> 00:02:37,160
Liu Ruyu

65
00:02:37,160 --> 00:02:38,360
is the princess of Beiqing,

66
00:02:38,360 --> 00:02:39,440
Shangguan Ruyu.

67
00:02:42,080 --> 00:02:45,039
I didn't find her name, Shangguan Ruyu,

68
00:02:45,039 --> 00:02:47,360
on the list of envoys
who are visiting the Capital.

69
00:02:47,800 --> 00:02:49,839
She managed to sneak
into the Capital so easily.

70
00:02:49,960 --> 00:02:51,000
That means

71
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:52,279
there is a spy in the Capital.

72
00:02:52,360 --> 00:02:53,360
Keep an eye on her.

73
00:02:53,720 --> 00:02:54,520
Yes.

74
00:02:56,960 --> 00:02:58,119
Shangguan Ruyu won't be able to harm us

75
00:02:58,119 --> 00:02:59,679
since she's on her own.

76
00:03:00,880 --> 00:03:02,479
But I have another worry now.

77
00:03:02,759 --> 00:03:04,000
It seems like the princess of Beiqing

78
00:03:04,160 --> 00:03:06,479
is being manipulated
by "Yuan Ju Qing" too.

79
00:03:07,520 --> 00:03:08,639
I didn't expect

80
00:03:08,639 --> 00:03:10,600
this man

81
00:03:11,199 --> 00:03:12,360
to be this omnipotent.

82
00:03:12,960 --> 00:03:14,039
Anyway,

83
00:03:14,600 --> 00:03:15,960
Xi and I

84
00:03:15,960 --> 00:03:17,919
will not get manipulated by him.

85
00:03:18,039 --> 00:03:20,160
I'm sure Her Highness
will be moved beyond words

86
00:03:20,160 --> 00:03:22,000
when she sees Your Highness doing
your best to protect her.

87
00:03:25,639 --> 00:03:27,399
I read her mind.

88
00:03:27,559 --> 00:03:29,240
She thought I was "toxic".

89
00:03:29,759 --> 00:03:30,960
She also said that she admired me,

90
00:03:30,960 --> 00:03:32,240
and called me the "Sixth Brother".

91
00:03:32,600 --> 00:03:33,600
However,

92
00:03:33,600 --> 00:03:35,320
no matter how you see it,

93
00:03:35,320 --> 00:03:36,160
I'm still

94
00:03:36,160 --> 00:03:37,839
the fourth brother, right?

95
00:03:38,880 --> 00:03:39,759
Yes.

96
00:03:40,880 --> 00:03:42,880
Could it be

97
00:03:42,880 --> 00:03:44,479
the dialect of Her Highness' hometown?

98
00:03:45,240 --> 00:03:46,199
Could it be "Lao Liu"?

99
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:47,800
"Lao Liu"?

100
00:03:51,039 --> 00:03:53,119
I guess...

101
00:03:53,639 --> 00:03:55,279
She's probably complimenting
Your Highness

102
00:03:55,279 --> 00:03:56,639
for your loyalty.

103
00:04:01,800 --> 00:04:03,199
If that's the case,

104
00:04:03,479 --> 00:04:04,880
you are

105
00:04:04,880 --> 00:04:05,960
my "Sixth Brother" too.

106
00:04:05,960 --> 00:04:07,039
Oh, no.

107
00:04:07,039 --> 00:04:08,199
I'm flattered.

108
00:04:08,199 --> 00:04:09,520
You're my "Sixth Brother".

109
00:04:09,679 --> 00:04:10,320
You're my "Sixth Brother".

110
00:04:10,320 --> 00:04:11,119
You're my "Sixth Brother".

111
00:04:11,119 --> 00:04:11,679
Here.

112
00:04:11,679 --> 00:04:12,160
You're my "Sixth Brother".

113
00:04:12,160 --> 00:04:13,440
Here's an osmanthus cake for you.

114
00:04:13,440 --> 00:04:14,240
Thank you, "Sixth Brother".

115
00:04:17,720 --> 00:04:18,519
"Sixth Brother".

116
00:04:23,839 --> 00:04:25,160
I'm sorry for being rude yesterday.

117
00:04:25,640 --> 00:04:27,720
I was planning to visit Your Highness
to send my apology.

118
00:04:28,040 --> 00:04:29,079
Little did I know...

119
00:04:29,839 --> 00:04:30,920
Little did I know

120
00:04:30,920 --> 00:04:32,160
Your Highness would ask me out instead.

121
00:04:32,160 --> 00:04:33,760
There's no need to be shy around me.

122
00:04:33,760 --> 00:04:36,160
It felt like we hit it off right away.

123
00:04:37,399 --> 00:04:38,440
(I want you to be more proactive.)

124
00:04:38,440 --> 00:04:40,200
Why can't you do me proud?

125
00:04:40,799 --> 00:04:41,679
It seems like

126
00:04:41,679 --> 00:04:43,160
I have only myself to count on.

127
00:04:44,480 --> 00:04:46,239
What a foolish woman.

128
00:04:46,559 --> 00:04:48,440
She has made things
so much easier for me.

129
00:04:50,440 --> 00:04:51,200
Miss Liu.

130
00:04:51,200 --> 00:04:53,000
Let me show you the garden.

131
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:53,799
Sure.

132
00:04:56,959 --> 00:04:57,600
Your Highness.

133
00:04:57,959 --> 00:04:59,640
I have investigated it

134
00:04:59,720 --> 00:05:01,200
and found the spy

135
00:05:01,200 --> 00:05:02,839
Beiqing planted in the Capital

136
00:05:03,440 --> 00:05:04,799
What about "Yuan Ju Qing"?

137
00:05:05,760 --> 00:05:07,040
I still have no clue about it.

138
00:05:11,760 --> 00:05:13,320
Then, we shall keep waiting

139
00:05:13,320 --> 00:05:14,359
and see what Miss Liu

140
00:05:14,559 --> 00:05:15,920
has in store for us.

141
00:05:22,880 --> 00:05:24,480
(This is a very suitable place.)

142
00:05:24,480 --> 00:05:26,119
I only need to find the right spot,

143
00:05:26,119 --> 00:05:29,119
and pretend that the stupid woman
pushes me into the pond.

144
00:05:31,519 --> 00:05:33,279
It's a very serene garden.

145
00:05:33,679 --> 00:05:35,880
There are goldfish in the pond too.

146
00:05:36,640 --> 00:05:38,440
I'm jealous that
you get to enjoy your time

147
00:05:38,440 --> 00:05:40,160
as a couple here.

148
00:05:40,679 --> 00:05:42,200
If Miss Liu likes this place,

149
00:05:42,200 --> 00:05:42,799
you should visit us

150
00:05:42,799 --> 00:05:43,959
more often.

151
00:05:44,519 --> 00:05:46,200
(What is she waiting for?)

152
00:05:48,399 --> 00:05:49,160
Forget it.

153
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:51,720
Let me do it myself.

154
00:05:52,600 --> 00:05:53,679
Miss Liu.

155
00:05:53,880 --> 00:05:54,839
Look.

156
00:05:55,480 --> 00:05:56,440
What is that?

157
00:05:57,119 --> 00:05:57,880
Here you go.

158
00:06:09,799 --> 00:06:10,839
Miss Liu.

159
00:06:11,079 --> 00:06:12,279
Although the fish is cute,

160
00:06:12,279 --> 00:06:13,640
you shouldn't have entered the water.

161
00:06:13,640 --> 00:06:15,200
What have I done?

162
00:06:15,440 --> 00:06:17,480
Why did Your Highness
push me into the pond?

163
00:06:18,640 --> 00:06:19,640
Did I push you?

164
00:06:19,640 --> 00:06:20,160
I...

165
00:06:21,160 --> 00:06:22,399
I guess

166
00:06:22,399 --> 00:06:24,079
I must have accidentally

167
00:06:24,079 --> 00:06:25,239
bumped into your slim body.

168
00:06:25,239 --> 00:06:26,200
I'm so sorry.

169
00:06:26,200 --> 00:06:26,839
Let me help you up.

170
00:06:26,839 --> 00:06:27,839
