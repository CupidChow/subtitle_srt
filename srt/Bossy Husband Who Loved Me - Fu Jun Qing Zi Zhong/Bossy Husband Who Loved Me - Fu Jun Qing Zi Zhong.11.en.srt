2
00:00:45,360 --> 00:00:46,319
My lady.

3
00:00:47,400 --> 00:00:48,439
You're so awesome.

4
00:01:11,120 --> 00:01:11,720
Who's that?

5
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:15,720
Who's that?

6
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:27,919
Qin Chuan?

7
00:01:29,720 --> 00:01:31,680
Why are you in my room at midnight?

8
00:01:35,559 --> 00:01:37,319
Is this your room?

9
00:01:38,480 --> 00:01:39,239
I am here

10
00:01:40,559 --> 00:01:41,760
to take a look.

11
00:01:43,360 --> 00:01:44,680
Taking a look?

12
00:01:44,760 --> 00:01:46,000
Do you think I would believe

13
00:01:46,839 --> 00:01:47,879
such an excuse?

14
00:01:49,480 --> 00:01:50,279
Um...

15
00:01:51,440 --> 00:01:52,559
If I said I was sleepwalking,

16
00:01:53,160 --> 00:01:54,160
you would believe me,

17
00:01:55,040 --> 00:01:55,879
wouldn't you?

18
00:01:57,040 --> 00:01:58,160
Brother.

19
00:01:58,160 --> 00:02:00,440
Put some effort
when you are giving excuses.

20
00:02:00,720 --> 00:02:01,720
Furthermore,

21
00:02:02,120 --> 00:02:04,279
I have the copyright to this sentence.

22
00:02:09,639 --> 00:02:10,600
Tell me.

23
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:13,520
Is it because you are drunk

24
00:02:14,759 --> 00:02:16,440
and lusting after me?

25
00:02:17,679 --> 00:02:18,800
It's totally impossible.

26
00:02:21,039 --> 00:02:23,800
Well, give me

27
00:02:23,800 --> 00:02:25,199
a reasonable explanation.

28
00:02:27,679 --> 00:02:28,639
I was

29
00:02:28,639 --> 00:02:29,960
really...

30
00:02:30,240 --> 00:02:31,160
Sleepwalking.

31
00:02:31,160 --> 00:02:31,720
Really?

32
00:02:32,240 --> 00:02:32,919
Fine.

33
00:02:33,240 --> 00:02:34,800
Do you remember
how you treated me last time

34
00:02:34,800 --> 00:02:36,000
when I was sleepwalking?

35
00:02:36,360 --> 00:02:37,320
I didn't forget.

36
00:02:42,759 --> 00:02:44,160
Did you lock the door?

37
00:02:44,960 --> 00:02:46,839
Are you planning to trap me?

38
00:02:47,399 --> 00:02:48,559
Someone, please come!

39
00:02:49,600 --> 00:02:50,639
Is anyone out there?

40
00:02:51,800 --> 00:02:52,839
Come here!

41
00:02:56,320 --> 00:02:58,279
Come!

42
00:03:01,320 --> 00:03:02,119
Your Highness.

43
00:03:02,639 --> 00:03:03,399
Last night,

44
00:03:04,080 --> 00:03:05,320
why was there such a commotion?

45
00:03:06,919 --> 00:03:08,639
All thanks to your idea.

46
00:03:08,759 --> 00:03:10,039
Last night, after I entered the room,

47
00:03:10,039 --> 00:03:11,240
someone locked the door.

48
00:03:11,240 --> 00:03:12,080
What?

49
00:03:14,399 --> 00:03:15,199
Um...

50
00:03:15,759 --> 00:03:16,919
Last night...

51
00:03:17,639 --> 00:03:18,479
Did you kiss each other?

52
00:03:31,399 --> 00:03:31,880
No.

53
00:03:31,880 --> 00:03:32,679
I mean

54
00:03:32,880 --> 00:03:34,520
were you able to
hear her inner thoughts?

55
00:03:36,479 --> 00:03:37,720
In that kind of situation,

56
00:03:37,960 --> 00:03:39,160
how would I be able to care about this?

57
00:03:41,440 --> 00:03:44,759
Sigh. I wonder who is being thick-faced.

58
00:03:46,119 --> 00:03:48,240
He is so calm and steady

59
00:03:48,240 --> 00:03:49,360
as if the matter doesn't concern him.

60
00:03:51,479 --> 00:03:52,559
Listen to me.

61
00:03:52,559 --> 00:03:53,320
It was a misunderstanding.

62
00:03:53,320 --> 00:03:54,119
Yes.

63
00:03:54,119 --> 00:03:54,919
I know.

64
00:03:55,240 --> 00:03:56,000
You were sleepwalking.

65
00:03:58,759 --> 00:03:59,360
Why are you laughing?

66
00:04:00,880 --> 00:04:01,679
It was you last night, wasn't it?

67
00:04:02,160 --> 00:04:03,399
No, I wouldn't dare to do that.

68
00:04:05,960 --> 00:04:08,279
I know Qin Chuan
better than anyone else.

69
00:04:08,440 --> 00:04:10,919
He's not lustful and he won't
cause trouble after drinking.

70
00:04:11,279 --> 00:04:13,479
He was indeed very strange last night.

71
00:04:19,640 --> 00:04:20,799
Why are you staring at me?

72
00:04:24,640 --> 00:04:26,079
I was looking at the scenery.

73
00:04:28,480 --> 00:04:30,640
I'm here to tell you clearly.

74
00:04:31,040 --> 00:04:31,839
In the future,

75
00:04:32,160 --> 00:04:33,160
do not enter my room.

76
00:04:45,720 --> 00:04:46,519
Zhao Tie.

77
00:04:47,839 --> 00:04:48,519
Zhao Tie.

78
00:04:49,920 --> 00:04:50,519
Yes, I'm here.

79
00:04:50,760 --> 00:04:51,920
I heard it just now.

80
00:04:54,760 --> 00:04:55,720
Did you hear it?

81
00:04:56,119 --> 00:04:56,920
Yes.

82
00:04:57,040 --> 00:04:58,079
That's great, Your Highness!

83
00:04:58,959 --> 00:04:59,760
Yes.

84
00:05:01,359 --> 00:05:03,160
However, what is the cause?

85
00:05:03,720 --> 00:05:04,760
As for the cause,

86
00:05:04,839 --> 00:05:05,839
I'm just a fool,

87
00:05:05,839 --> 00:05:06,799
I couldn't think of it.

88
00:05:07,279 --> 00:05:07,959
Um...

89
00:05:08,239 --> 00:05:09,640
Your Highness, what is our next step?

90
00:05:11,119 --> 00:05:12,679
After the additional
investigation in these few days,

91
00:05:12,839 --> 00:05:13,920
I have gathered solid evidence

92
00:05:13,920 --> 00:05:14,880
for the corruption case.

93
00:05:15,079 --> 00:05:15,920
Take my authenticating object.

94
00:05:16,079 --> 00:05:17,399
Arrest all the officials
who are involved.

95
00:05:17,720 --> 00:05:18,760
Let the three judicial ministries
have a joint hearing

96
00:05:18,760 --> 00:05:19,959
and reveal whoever is behind this.

97
00:05:20,519 --> 00:05:22,839
I'll continue checking
the background of "Yuan Ju Qing".

98
00:05:23,640 --> 00:05:24,440
Yes, Your Highness.

99
00:05:34,839 --> 00:05:35,640
Crook!

100
00:05:37,239 --> 00:05:38,440
You finally got your retribution!

101
00:05:52,959 --> 00:05:54,000
Prince Tan.

102
00:05:54,239 --> 00:05:55,200
I'm sorry.

103
00:05:55,279 --> 00:05:56,720
I need you to come with me.

104
00:06:10,760 --> 00:06:11,839
What is this?
