00:00:10,760 --> 00:00:12,560
(My mission is to steal the ledger.)

3
00:00:13,119 --> 00:00:15,119
(It didn't mention
that I can't make a copy of it.)

4
00:00:15,680 --> 00:00:17,280
(Now I've completed my mission,)

5
00:00:17,280 --> 00:00:19,360
(Qin Chuan gets to investigate
the corruption case as well.)

6
00:00:19,600 --> 00:00:20,719
(A world where only the dummy Qin Yu)

7
00:00:20,719 --> 00:00:21,879
(is hurt.)

8
00:00:21,879 --> 00:00:22,959
(Mission complete!)

9
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:28,639
As for this,

10
00:00:30,440 --> 00:00:31,319
you can feed the pig.

11
00:00:31,840 --> 00:00:32,319
This...

12
00:00:33,439 --> 00:00:33,880
I...

13
00:00:34,319 --> 00:00:34,840
Go.

14
00:00:35,520 --> 00:00:36,840
Alright.

15
00:00:39,759 --> 00:00:42,159
Oh, Mu Xiaoxi.

16
00:00:42,680 --> 00:00:44,639
You are such a genius!

17
00:00:52,040 --> 00:00:52,959
Damn!

18
00:00:53,200 --> 00:00:54,319
Who struck the lightning on me again?

19
00:00:55,119 --> 00:00:55,759
Storyline Manager!

20
00:00:56,080 --> 00:00:56,799
Storyline Manager!

21
00:00:57,159 --> 00:00:58,319
Storyline Manager, come to the front.

22
00:01:02,080 --> 00:01:03,720
You failed your task.

23
00:01:03,720 --> 00:01:05,760
According to the rule of punishment,

24
00:01:05,760 --> 00:01:07,959
not only you will be
struck by lightning,

25
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:09,959
but also your Back-to-city Piece

26
00:01:09,959 --> 00:01:11,400
will be deducted by one piece.

27
00:01:15,279 --> 00:01:17,120
But I gave the ledger to Qin Yu.

28
00:01:17,319 --> 00:01:18,239
Who are you to say I have failed?

29
00:01:18,599 --> 00:01:19,239
Give it to me.

30
00:01:19,239 --> 00:01:21,680
Because the ledger
that you stole was fake

31
00:01:21,839 --> 00:01:23,400
So, mission...

32
00:01:23,400 --> 00:01:24,680
Fail!

33
00:01:25,839 --> 00:01:27,000
Fake?

34
00:01:27,559 --> 00:01:28,720
That's impossible.

35
00:01:29,040 --> 00:01:29,800
Storyline Manager,

36
00:01:32,160 --> 00:01:33,199
that's impossible.

37
00:01:33,639 --> 00:01:35,319
I didn't write this in the novel.

38
00:01:36,559 --> 00:01:38,680
In the original plot,

39
00:01:38,800 --> 00:01:41,279
Shopkeeper Xu died
after being struck by lightning.

40
00:01:41,959 --> 00:01:43,199
But now he isn't dead.

41
00:01:43,720 --> 00:01:45,400
The ledger turns out to be a fake one.

42
00:01:47,360 --> 00:01:49,919
What went wrong?

43
00:02:14,240 --> 00:02:15,080
Are you reading?

44
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:23,039
Have some tea.

45
00:02:24,199 --> 00:02:25,119
Why are you here?

46
00:02:26,080 --> 00:02:28,199
I just passed by

47
00:02:28,199 --> 00:02:29,000
and saw you.

48
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:30,080
So I come to say hi.

49
00:02:32,839 --> 00:02:34,440
The second rule is,

50
00:02:34,600 --> 00:02:36,759
do not appear before me
unless it's necessary.

51
00:02:36,759 --> 00:02:38,360
How many times
do I have to tell you this?

52
00:02:39,360 --> 00:02:40,839
Oh, come on. We've known each other

53
00:02:40,839 --> 00:02:41,759
for quite some time.

54
00:02:41,759 --> 00:02:43,600
Why do you go off all of a sudden?

55
00:02:44,800 --> 00:02:46,559
What if I wanted to?

56
00:02:51,759 --> 00:02:53,440
I just wanted to remind you.

57
00:02:54,039 --> 00:02:55,240
Have you ever thought

58
00:02:55,240 --> 00:02:57,399
that Shopkeeper Xu brought you
a piece of fake evidence?

59
00:03:00,720 --> 00:03:01,559
Ridiculous!

60
00:03:02,160 --> 00:03:04,360
Do you think I'm as ignorant as you?

61
00:03:04,520 --> 00:03:05,119
Furthermore,

62
00:03:05,520 --> 00:03:07,000
you're my wife in name only.

63
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:08,240
Stop meddling

64
00:03:08,240 --> 00:03:09,320
in my business.

65
00:03:09,919 --> 00:03:12,119
Why are you being so aggressive today?

66
00:03:15,279 --> 00:03:16,520
How can I be polite

67
00:03:16,520 --> 00:03:17,919
to someone like you?

68
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:19,839
(Damn it, Qin Chuan.)

69
00:03:19,839 --> 00:03:21,039
I even went against the original plot

70
00:03:21,039 --> 00:03:22,520
and copied a ledger

71
00:03:22,520 --> 00:03:23,199
for you to investigate the case.

72
00:03:23,639 --> 00:03:24,800
(No good deed goes unpunished!)

73
00:03:25,720 --> 00:03:26,440
Fine.

74
00:03:26,559 --> 00:03:27,600
You wanted to create boundaries, right?

75
00:03:27,919 --> 00:03:29,039
I get it.

76
00:03:31,600 --> 00:03:32,279
Wait a minute.

77
00:03:32,279 --> 00:03:33,160
Wait?

78
00:03:33,279 --> 00:03:34,479
If I appear before you again,

79
00:03:34,479 --> 00:03:36,160
I'll write my name backward.

80
00:03:44,039 --> 00:03:44,720
Your Highness,

81
00:03:44,720 --> 00:03:45,960
the ledger is indeed

82
00:03:45,960 --> 00:03:47,960
identical to the fake ledger

83
00:03:47,960 --> 00:03:48,880
that I copied.

84
00:03:56,560 --> 00:03:58,300
Same content.
Will not affect the investigation.

85
00:03:59,679 --> 00:04:01,160
She stole the ledger

86
00:04:01,399 --> 00:04:03,080
to help Prince Tan, that was obvious.

87
00:04:03,360 --> 00:04:05,240
But, leaving an identical copy

88
00:04:05,639 --> 00:04:09,559
would make all the efforts go in vain.

89
00:04:10,800 --> 00:04:12,320
In this way,

90
00:04:13,360 --> 00:04:15,360
Prince Tan will think
that you lost the ledger

91
00:04:15,600 --> 00:04:16,839
and he might let his guard down,

92
00:04:17,079 --> 00:04:19,000
making the process of
investigation easier.

93
00:04:19,119 --> 00:04:20,119
With that being said,

94
00:04:20,279 --> 00:04:21,799
Her Highness wasn't helping Prince Tan,

95
00:04:21,799 --> 00:04:23,160
she was helping you.

96
00:04:26,200 --> 00:04:27,279
But,

97
00:04:27,880 --> 00:04:29,519
why would she help me?

98
00:04:31,160 --> 00:04:31,760
Your Highness,

99
00:04:31,839 --> 00:04:33,279
everyone in the capital knows

100
00:04:33,279 --> 00:04:34,480
Her Highness's love for you.

101
00:04:34,640 --> 00:04:35,480
When she knew

102
00:04:35,480 --> 00:04:37,359
Prince Tan was targeting you,

103
00:04:37,359 --> 00:04:38,720
she came forward.

104
00:04:38,720 --> 00:04:41,160
She does one thing
under cover of another.

105
00:04:41,399 --> 00:04:42,160
Think about it.

106
00:04:42,160 --> 00:04:43,279
Don't you think so?

107
00:04:46,600 --> 00:04:48,399
Well, she did use me.

108
00:04:48,399 --> 00:04:49,559
But she did help me

109
00:04:49,559 --> 00:04:51,000
in this matter.

110
00:04:51,200 --> 00:04:52,600
I was wrong about her.

111
00:04:53,320 --> 00:04:54,119
Right,

112
00:04:54,600 --> 00:04:56,040
the mysterious Yuan Giant

113
00:04:56,040 --> 00:04:57,200
seemed to be involved too.

114
00:04:57,200 --> 00:04:58,920
Hurry up with the investigation.

115
00:04:59,160 --> 00:04:59,760
Sure.

116
00:05:01,399 --> 00:05:02,079
Your Highness,

117
00:05:02,519 --> 00:05:04,880
since you can listen to
Her Highness's inner voice,

118
00:05:05,160 --> 00:05:07,399
why don't you start from her?

119
00:05:07,559 --> 00:05:08,880
Listen to it more often,

120
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:10,399
there must be something.

121
00:05:11,880 --> 00:05:13,040
Great minds think alike.

122
00:05:13,559 --> 00:05:14,359
Your Highness!

123
00:05:15,679 --> 00:05:16,279
Your Highness.

124
00:05:16,519 --> 00:05:17,799
Her Highness just packed and leave.

125
00:05:17,799 --> 00:05:18,720
She went back to her maiden home.

126
00:05:22,359 --> 00:05:23,079
Xixi,

127
00:05:23,160 --> 00:05:24,640
you've only been gone for two days.

128
00:05:24,839 --> 00:05:26,239
Why did you come back?

129
00:05:26,239 --> 00:05:27,519
We broke up.

130
00:05:29,160 --> 00:05:30,480
As of today,

131
00:05:30,760 --> 00:05:31,799
Qin Chuan and I

132
00:05:31,799 --> 00:05:32,760
are officially separated.

133
00:05:35,200 --> 00:05:36,000
Nonsense!

134
00:05:36,600 --> 00:05:37,799
Couples might inevitably

135
00:05:37,799 --> 00:05:39,359
fight sometimes.

136
00:05:39,600 --> 00:05:41,079
Your mother and I fought too.

137
00:05:41,079 --> 00:05:42,720
Your mother's temper was terribly...

138
00:05:44,880 --> 00:05:45,959
reasonable.

139
00:05:52,399 --> 00:05:53,279
Xixi.

140
00:05:53,279 --> 00:05:54,000
Regarding this,

141
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:56,079
you shall learn from me.

142
00:05:56,119 --> 00:05:57,359
It's common for couples

143
00:05:57,359 --> 00:05:58,920
to have disagreements.

144
00:05:58,920 --> 00:06:00,640
Do not take it seriously.

145
00:06:01,040 --> 00:06:02,119
Whatever. I'm not going back.

146
00:06:02,959 --> 00:06:03,559
Sir.

147
00:06:03,559 --> 00:06:05,040
Prince Rui is at the door.

148
00:06:05,839 --> 00:06:06,799
What is he doing here?

149
00:06:06,920 --> 00:06:07,519
Don't let him in.

150
00:06:07,640 --> 00:06:08,440
Let him in!

151
00:06:08,920 --> 00:06:10,399
He's my son-in-law.
There's no need to be so polite.

152
00:06:10,839 --> 00:06:11,720
Let him in.

153
00:06:12,880 --> 00:06:13,559
Yes, sir.

154
00:06:32,320 --> 00:06:33,200
Xixi.

155
00:06:34,320 --> 00:06:35,640
Help His Highness with the food.

156
00:06:38,399 --> 00:06:39,079
No.

157
00:06:42,239 --> 00:06:43,040
It's okay.

158
00:06:43,320 --> 00:06:44,200
I can help myself.

159
00:06:46,200 --> 00:06:46,959
Your Highness,

160
00:06:47,480 --> 00:06:48,519
my daughter

161
00:06:48,519 --> 00:06:49,679
was spoiled by her mother.

162
00:06:50,119 --> 00:06:51,200
She must bring you a lot of trouble.

163
00:06:52,440 --> 00:06:53,239
I...

164
00:06:53,679 --> 00:06:55,079
I didn't treat her well too.

165
00:06:55,239 --> 00:06:56,359
Your Highness, you're exaggerating.

166
00:06:57,239 --> 00:06:59,000
It's common for a couple

167
00:07:00,519 --> 00:07:01,920
to have disagreements.

168
00:07:01,920 --> 00:07:02,519
Right.

169
00:07:02,679 --> 00:07:04,880
You are officially married
and had your first night together.

170
00:07:04,920 --> 00:07:06,440
You can overcome everything.

171
00:07:06,640 --> 00:07:07,679
It's good to talk it out.

172
00:07:09,440 --> 00:07:10,799
First night...
