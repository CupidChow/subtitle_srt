2
00:00:12,960 --> 00:00:13,760
Ding.

3
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:15,880
What are you doing?

4
00:00:16,840 --> 00:00:17,719
I...

5
00:00:17,719 --> 00:00:18,239
You...

6
00:00:18,239 --> 00:00:19,440
Why are you holding the pigeon?

7
00:00:20,600 --> 00:00:22,760
His Highness has been working hard
on his poems.

8
00:00:27,280 --> 00:00:29,959
I told Ding to take good care of him.

9
00:00:30,479 --> 00:00:31,600
I told Ding to cook this pigeon

10
00:00:31,600 --> 00:00:32,759
and serve it to His Highness

11
00:00:32,759 --> 00:00:34,240
as supplements.

12
00:00:36,400 --> 00:00:37,520
Yes.

13
00:00:37,520 --> 00:00:39,080
Supplements for His Highness.

14
00:00:46,680 --> 00:00:48,159
Anything else I can help you with?

15
00:00:49,599 --> 00:00:51,279
It's fine. I won't disturb you further.

16
00:00:51,279 --> 00:00:52,479
I won't disturb you further.

17
00:01:01,200 --> 00:01:02,319
Remember this.

18
00:01:02,319 --> 00:01:03,880
Always stay by his side.

19
00:01:04,120 --> 00:01:04,800
Yes,

20
00:01:04,800 --> 00:01:05,720
Your Highness.

21
00:01:05,720 --> 00:01:06,919
Pull yourself together.

22
00:01:07,919 --> 00:01:08,720
Yes.

23
00:01:09,279 --> 00:01:10,080
Louder.

24
00:01:10,080 --> 00:01:10,800
Yes.

25
00:01:12,120 --> 00:01:13,839
That's better.

26
00:01:19,919 --> 00:01:21,000
He gave me a real scare.

27
00:01:22,160 --> 00:01:23,559
Thankfully, Her Highness was there
to help me resolve the issue.

28
00:01:24,599 --> 00:01:25,639
I was worrying unnecessarily.

29
00:01:35,400 --> 00:01:36,199
Your Highness.

30
00:01:37,919 --> 00:01:39,160
Any progress?

31
00:01:40,080 --> 00:01:40,959
I'm sorry I'm a disappointment.

32
00:01:40,959 --> 00:01:42,160
I haven't found any clues yet.

33
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:44,720
I spoke to many physicians

34
00:01:44,720 --> 00:01:45,919
and fortune-tellers,

35
00:01:45,919 --> 00:01:47,839
but still didn't manage
to get any useful information.

36
00:01:48,559 --> 00:01:49,839
Regarding Her Highness,

37
00:01:49,839 --> 00:01:51,879
other than paying more attention to Ding
than usual,

38
00:01:51,879 --> 00:01:53,519
there's nothing odd too.

39
00:01:55,160 --> 00:01:55,959
Ding?

40
00:01:56,519 --> 00:01:57,839
Have you figured out why?

41
00:01:58,080 --> 00:01:59,559
I have investigated it.

42
00:01:59,919 --> 00:02:00,800
Her Highness worried

43
00:02:00,800 --> 00:02:01,720
about Your Highness' wellbeing.

44
00:02:01,720 --> 00:02:03,760
She told Ding to take good care
of Your Highness.

45
00:02:03,959 --> 00:02:04,879
After all,

46
00:02:04,879 --> 00:02:06,559
Her Highness is still in love with you.

47
00:02:10,800 --> 00:02:11,600
Qin Chuan?

48
00:02:17,600 --> 00:02:18,800
What are you doing here?

49
00:02:19,639 --> 00:02:22,399
Have you not written the poems yet?

50
00:02:23,160 --> 00:02:25,559
You seem a little too interested

51
00:02:25,559 --> 00:02:26,919
in the progress of my poetry writing.

52
00:02:28,479 --> 00:02:30,039
How could you say that?

53
00:02:30,240 --> 00:02:31,639
We're husband and wife.

54
00:02:31,639 --> 00:02:34,160
Of course, we share
all our joy and sorrow.

55
00:02:34,320 --> 00:02:36,479
If you win the contest,

56
00:02:36,479 --> 00:02:39,000
I'll be proud of you too, right?

57
00:02:42,119 --> 00:02:43,679
We're going to the palace soon.

58
00:02:44,199 --> 00:02:45,279
He needs to write the poems soon,

59
00:02:45,279 --> 00:02:46,880
or Ding won't have time to steal them

60
00:02:46,880 --> 00:02:48,160
and hand them to Prince Tai.

61
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:51,800
Oh!

62
00:02:51,800 --> 00:02:53,360
I got it.

63
00:02:53,600 --> 00:02:56,639
You need inspiration
to write poems, right?

64
00:02:57,279 --> 00:02:59,000
The yard has a better atmosphere

65
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:01,039
than the study.

66
00:03:02,039 --> 00:03:02,720
Fine.

67
00:03:02,720 --> 00:03:03,800
I won't disturb you anymore.

68
00:03:03,880 --> 00:03:06,160
Take your time.

69
00:03:06,800 --> 00:03:07,639
Take your time.

70
00:03:08,240 --> 00:03:09,039
Good luck!

71
00:03:22,320 --> 00:03:23,160
Your Highness.

72
00:03:23,320 --> 00:03:24,960
Did you just read Her Highness' mind

73
00:03:24,960 --> 00:03:25,960
and find out another secret?

74
00:03:27,479 --> 00:03:29,639
She wants Ding to steal my poems

75
00:03:30,399 --> 00:03:31,279
and hand them to Prince Tai.

76
00:03:32,759 --> 00:03:33,880
How dare Ding

77
00:03:33,880 --> 00:03:35,080
betray Your Highness?

78
00:03:35,080 --> 00:03:36,279
I'll go and arrest him now.

79
00:03:36,279 --> 00:03:37,080
Wait.

80
00:03:38,639 --> 00:03:39,440
Come back.

81
00:03:41,839 --> 00:03:42,759
We need to be patient

82
00:03:43,600 --> 00:03:44,679
for greater benefits.

83
00:03:49,399 --> 00:03:51,320
Ding. Come here. Quick.

84
00:03:51,639 --> 00:03:53,559
Look how dirty the table is.

85
00:03:53,559 --> 00:03:54,479
Clean them up.

86
00:03:55,160 --> 00:03:55,919
Tie.

87
00:03:56,240 --> 00:03:57,080
It's not that dirty.

88
00:03:59,639 --> 00:04:00,520
Is it not?

89
00:04:01,240 --> 00:04:02,360
Isn't it dirty?

90
00:04:03,279 --> 00:04:03,919
Clean it up.

91
00:04:10,960 --> 00:04:11,639
Your Highness.

92
00:04:11,639 --> 00:04:13,039
How's the poetry writing going?

93
00:04:13,759 --> 00:04:15,279
I've finally written poems

94
00:04:15,279 --> 00:04:16,799
I'm happy with.

95
00:04:17,079 --> 00:04:18,679
Congratulations, Your Highness.

96
00:04:18,679 --> 00:04:21,799
You'll definitely win the first place
in the Poetry Contest tomorrow.

97
00:04:22,839 --> 00:04:23,559
All right.

98
00:04:23,679 --> 00:04:25,399
I'm tired of sitting here.

99
00:04:27,559 --> 00:04:28,760
Remember

100
00:04:28,760 --> 00:04:31,119
to help me pack these poems.

101
00:04:31,519 --> 00:04:32,320
Yes.

102
00:04:40,640 --> 00:04:41,480
Tie.

103
00:04:41,679 --> 00:04:43,279
You should keep His Highness company.

104
00:04:43,279 --> 00:04:44,279
I can handle this.

105
00:04:46,079 --> 00:04:46,799
Not bad.

106
00:04:47,880 --> 00:04:50,079
You're young,

107
00:04:50,320 --> 00:04:51,359
but very sensible.

108
00:04:51,359 --> 00:04:52,760
You'll surely have a bright future.

109
00:04:52,839 --> 00:04:53,839
Do a good job.

110
00:04:53,839 --> 00:04:54,880
Clean it up.

111
00:05:29,320 --> 00:05:29,720
Yes.

112
00:05:35,720 --> 00:05:36,799
Why is he here?

113
00:05:47,239 --> 00:05:50,200
Why is Zhao Tie watching Ding too?

114
00:05:50,679 --> 00:05:51,880
Did he fail

115
00:05:52,119 --> 00:05:53,600
to steal the poems?

116
00:05:53,920 --> 00:05:54,559
That shouldn't be the case.

117
00:05:55,480 --> 00:05:56,799
I saw it myself.

118
00:05:58,399 --> 00:06:00,920
When I tried
to steal the ledger previously,

119
00:06:01,920 --> 00:06:04,440
it seemed like everything
was going smoothly,

120
00:06:04,720 --> 00:06:05,720
but I ended up failing the mission too.

121
00:06:06,839 --> 00:06:08,799
If I fail again this time...

122
00:06:09,640 --> 00:06:10,239
No.

123
00:06:10,679 --> 00:06:11,399
My life is at stake.

124
00:06:11,839 --> 00:06:13,200
I need to check it out myself.

125
00:06:59,799 --> 00:07:01,119
No way...
