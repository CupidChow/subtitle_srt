2
00:00:22,360 --> 00:00:22,920
Um...

3
00:00:23,040 --> 00:00:25,399
They were just practicing
the unique kung fu skill.

4
00:00:25,799 --> 00:00:28,319
Why are they drunk?

5
00:00:30,440 --> 00:00:33,520
There is something fishy between
His Highness and the guard.

6
00:00:33,520 --> 00:00:34,520
All right.

7
00:00:35,799 --> 00:00:36,720
What do they call this?

8
00:00:37,439 --> 00:00:40,599
The more he drowns
his sorrows, the sadder he gets.

9
00:00:41,040 --> 00:00:42,119
Look, His Highness

10
00:00:43,279 --> 00:00:44,360
has a good look and skills.

11
00:00:44,720 --> 00:00:45,599
He is also wise and brave.

12
00:00:46,080 --> 00:00:48,439
However, he is so incapable
when it comes to

13
00:00:48,720 --> 00:00:49,720
relationship issues.

14
00:00:50,680 --> 00:00:52,680
As a male, how can he take this?

15
00:00:52,680 --> 00:00:53,720
What should we do?

16
00:00:56,840 --> 00:00:57,840
We have to help him.

17
00:01:15,120 --> 00:01:16,120
Father-in-law.

18
00:01:17,080 --> 00:01:17,919
Your Highness.

19
00:01:17,919 --> 00:01:18,800
You're awake.

20
00:01:26,279 --> 00:01:27,319
The sky is so dark already.

21
00:01:27,319 --> 00:01:28,199
Yes.

22
00:01:29,040 --> 00:01:31,040
Your Highness,
alcohol is harmful to your body.

23
00:01:31,160 --> 00:01:33,519
Please do not drink
so much in the future.

24
00:01:33,879 --> 00:01:35,440
It's late now.

25
00:01:35,440 --> 00:01:36,559
Please stay overnight

26
00:01:36,559 --> 00:01:38,720
at my house tonight.

27
00:01:39,519 --> 00:01:40,559
There's no need to.

28
00:01:40,559 --> 00:01:41,879
I'll head home.

29
00:01:42,120 --> 00:01:43,959
Your Highness.

30
00:01:44,760 --> 00:01:46,839
If you are weak in sexual relationships,

31
00:01:46,839 --> 00:01:48,680
don't be discouraged.

32
00:01:49,599 --> 00:01:51,800
This is a famous medicine from the city.

33
00:01:51,800 --> 00:01:52,680
Take a few pills.

34
00:01:52,680 --> 00:01:55,120
You will surely be energetic.

35
00:01:55,599 --> 00:01:56,760
Father-in-law, you've misunderstood.

36
00:01:56,760 --> 00:01:57,800
There's nothing wrong with me.

37
00:01:57,800 --> 00:01:58,360
Ah!

38
00:01:58,760 --> 00:02:00,440
Xixi doesn't know about this.

39
00:02:01,440 --> 00:02:03,120
I really don't need it.

40
00:02:03,120 --> 00:02:04,279
You do.

41
00:02:04,279 --> 00:02:04,919
Your Highness.

42
00:02:04,919 --> 00:02:05,720
I don't need it.

43
00:02:05,720 --> 00:02:06,959
Oh, Xixi.

44
00:02:09,800 --> 00:02:10,520
Xixi.

45
00:02:11,039 --> 00:02:13,119
Tonight, His Highness
will stay overnight at our house.

46
00:02:13,119 --> 00:02:14,399
Make sure you serve him well.

47
00:02:14,919 --> 00:02:15,520
That...

48
00:02:16,880 --> 00:02:17,639
He's a guy.

49
00:02:18,039 --> 00:02:19,759
It's normal for him
to have problems occasionally.

50
00:02:20,160 --> 00:02:21,440
You should be more understanding.

51
00:02:21,440 --> 00:02:23,000
Focus on giving encouragement.

52
00:02:23,199 --> 00:02:25,000
Why should I encourage him?

53
00:02:25,279 --> 00:02:26,600
Let me make things clear.

54
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:28,440
I won't sleep in the same room with him.

55
00:02:30,119 --> 00:02:30,759
No problem.

56
00:02:31,119 --> 00:02:32,119
We'll sleep in different rooms then.

57
00:02:45,839 --> 00:02:47,800
Why do you keep staring at me?

58
00:02:50,679 --> 00:02:51,960
Such a weird person.

59
00:02:57,880 --> 00:02:58,679
I've tried every way.

60
00:02:59,600 --> 00:03:00,399
I still couldn't hear it.

61
00:03:01,520 --> 00:03:02,399
Hmm...

62
00:03:02,639 --> 00:03:03,839
Holding hands doesn't work.

63
00:03:04,240 --> 00:03:05,360
Taking medicine also doesn't work.

64
00:03:05,639 --> 00:03:06,440
Enough.

65
00:03:06,720 --> 00:03:07,880
We should come to a stop.

66
00:03:08,240 --> 00:03:09,279
I think

67
00:03:09,679 --> 00:03:10,759
it is just a misunderstanding.

68
00:03:10,759 --> 00:03:11,399
No!

69
00:03:12,360 --> 00:03:13,320
I think

70
00:03:13,320 --> 00:03:14,679
we shouldn't give up easily.

71
00:03:15,039 --> 00:03:16,520
Please recall carefully.

72
00:03:16,679 --> 00:03:18,479
Wasn't there anything
special that happened?

73
00:03:26,320 --> 00:03:27,160
At that time,

74
00:03:28,080 --> 00:03:29,520
in order to let me drink the medicine,

75
00:03:31,080 --> 00:03:32,600
she fed me with her mouth.

76
00:03:34,039 --> 00:03:35,320
This is such an important point!

77
00:03:35,320 --> 00:03:36,479
Why didn't you tell me?

78
00:03:36,639 --> 00:03:38,839
This is so embarrassing.
How do you expect me to say that?

79
00:03:39,520 --> 00:03:41,039
Moreover, that was merely a coincidence.

80
00:03:58,839 --> 00:04:00,160
However, at that moment,

81
00:04:01,320 --> 00:04:02,679
there seemed to be something strange.

82
00:04:02,679 --> 00:04:03,080
似乎真有异象发生

83
00:04:07,360 --> 00:04:08,360
I see.

84
00:04:10,520 --> 00:04:13,080
Your Highness, give it a try.

85
00:04:15,880 --> 00:04:16,959
There's no need to.

86
00:04:17,200 --> 00:04:18,359
Your Highness.

87
00:04:18,359 --> 00:04:19,720
Don't be shy.

88
00:04:19,720 --> 00:04:20,920
I'm willing to sacrifice myself

89
00:04:20,920 --> 00:04:22,119
for your mind-reading ability!

90
00:04:22,119 --> 00:04:23,119
Come on!

91
00:04:28,079 --> 00:04:29,079
You don't have to sacrifice.

92
00:04:29,239 --> 00:04:30,480
Just live well.

93
00:04:30,880 --> 00:04:31,600
Well.

94
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:32,920
If you don't want to sacrifice me,

95
00:04:33,359 --> 00:04:34,600
then go and try with Her Highness.

96
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:36,920
It's ridiculous!

97
00:04:37,079 --> 00:04:39,440
I'm not someone
who makes use of my sex appeal.

98
00:05:06,119 --> 00:05:06,920
Master.

99
00:05:07,320 --> 00:05:08,359
He went in.

100
00:05:09,359 --> 00:05:10,600
This guy is quite good.

101
00:05:10,600 --> 00:05:11,880
Being a man,

102
00:05:12,239 --> 00:05:13,600
what doesn't kill him
makes him stronger.

103
00:05:16,959 --> 00:05:18,160
I prepared some for myself.

104
00:05:20,160 --> 00:05:21,079
So useless.

105
00:05:21,519 --> 00:05:22,399
I'm old now.

106
00:05:23,279 --> 00:05:24,440
It's understandable.

107
00:05:24,480 --> 00:05:26,880
When we were young,
I don't think you were very capable.

108
00:05:26,880 --> 00:05:28,519
When I was young...

109
00:05:28,679 --> 00:05:29,679
Lower your volume!

110
00:05:29,880 --> 00:05:31,720
We are here to settle the problem
between His Highness and Xiaoxi.

111
00:05:32,079 --> 00:05:33,239
Can you have some self-respect?

112
00:05:34,679 --> 00:05:35,359
Let's go!

113
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:21,000
♪The flickering light of a candle
is telling the night's story♪

114
00:07:23,200 --> 00:07:29,800
♪I could only look up
to the sky when I'm missing you♪

115
00:07:30,600 --> 00:07:37,800
♪A silent hope is hidden

116

♪It is measuring
