2
00:00:12,359 --> 00:00:12,920
Xiu'er.

3
00:00:12,920 --> 00:00:13,560
Look at this.

4
00:00:14,520 --> 00:00:15,720
The fish is enjoying their food.

5
00:00:16,159 --> 00:00:16,799
Oh.

6
00:00:28,079 --> 00:00:28,600
Zhao Tie.

7
00:00:28,879 --> 00:00:29,399
Yes.

8
00:00:29,680 --> 00:00:31,319
The weather is pretty good today.

9
00:00:31,639 --> 00:00:32,279
Look.

10
00:00:32,279 --> 00:00:32,799
Yes.

11
00:00:32,799 --> 00:00:34,799
The fish looks especially happy too.

12
00:00:35,040 --> 00:00:36,360
You're here too.

13
00:00:37,759 --> 00:00:38,639
There's no need to say anything.

14
00:00:38,840 --> 00:00:39,560
I get it.

15
00:00:39,680 --> 00:00:41,240
Rule number two.

16
00:00:41,439 --> 00:00:42,639
Don't appear before you.

17
00:00:43,319 --> 00:00:44,240
Enjoy the view.

18
00:00:44,240 --> 00:00:44,959
I'll leave.

19
00:00:48,040 --> 00:00:49,240
(What a plain outfit.)

20
00:00:49,240 --> 00:00:50,200
(He has really bad taste.)

21
00:01:02,080 --> 00:01:02,680
Here.

22
00:01:02,880 --> 00:01:03,560
Young Lady.

23
00:01:03,680 --> 00:01:04,800
Please slow down.

24
00:01:04,800 --> 00:01:05,480
I can't keep up with you.

25
00:01:05,480 --> 00:01:06,319
Go with your feelings.

26
00:01:06,959 --> 00:01:08,959
Five. Six. Seven. Eight.

27
00:01:10,160 --> 00:01:10,599
Hurry up.

28
00:01:10,839 --> 00:01:11,519
Five. Six.

29
00:01:14,080 --> 00:01:14,959
Seven. Eight.

30
00:01:21,120 --> 00:01:23,360
Five. Six. Seven. Eight.

31
00:01:24,800 --> 00:01:25,599
Lift your legs.

32
00:01:27,239 --> 00:01:27,959
That's right.

33
00:01:28,040 --> 00:01:28,760
Five. Six. Seven. Go.

34
00:01:28,760 --> 00:01:30,480
Five. Six. Seven. Go.

35
00:01:33,639 --> 00:01:34,519
That's right.

36
00:01:34,519 --> 00:01:34,959
Your Highness.

37
00:01:35,160 --> 00:01:35,680
Your Highness.

38
00:01:35,680 --> 00:01:36,279
Come.

39
00:01:36,279 --> 00:01:36,680
Join us.

40
00:01:36,680 --> 00:01:36,959
Join us.

41
00:01:38,680 --> 00:01:39,959
Six. Seven. Eight.

42
00:01:41,279 --> 00:01:42,680
Why are you everywhere?

43
00:01:43,680 --> 00:01:44,519
The weather

44
00:01:45,720 --> 00:01:46,839
is pretty good today.

45
00:01:47,199 --> 00:01:49,599
I thought I should get
some exercise too.

46
00:01:51,080 --> 00:01:51,839
Sure.

47
00:01:52,040 --> 00:01:53,599
Then, you can exercise here.

48
00:01:53,599 --> 00:01:54,239
I'll leave.

49
00:01:54,440 --> 00:01:55,120
By the way,

50
00:01:55,360 --> 00:01:57,080
if you don't do it right,

51
00:01:57,080 --> 00:01:58,199
your exercise won't be effective.

52
00:02:00,879 --> 00:02:02,080
(He's a grown man,)

53
00:02:02,080 --> 00:02:03,120
(but is wearing bright clothes.)

54
00:02:03,760 --> 00:02:04,480
How disgusting.

55
00:02:06,239 --> 00:02:06,519
Let's go.

56
00:02:06,519 --> 00:02:06,959
Oh.

57
00:02:07,199 --> 00:02:08,160
Yes, Young Lady.

58
00:02:08,479 --> 00:02:09,440
What dance is this?

59
00:02:09,440 --> 00:02:09,880
It's quite tiring.

60
00:02:13,199 --> 00:02:15,119
The moon is big and round tonight.

61
00:02:15,360 --> 00:02:16,440
It's so pretty.

62
00:02:17,440 --> 00:02:18,279
Yes.

63
00:02:18,800 --> 00:02:20,199
Back in our city,

64
00:02:20,199 --> 00:02:22,559
we view the moon through a telescope.

65
00:02:23,240 --> 00:02:23,759
Huh?

66
00:02:30,639 --> 00:02:31,320
Zhao Tie.

67
00:02:33,160 --> 00:02:34,800
The moon is so beautiful tonight.

68
00:02:35,279 --> 00:02:35,800
Hmm.

69
00:02:36,639 --> 00:02:37,240
It's pretty.

70
00:02:38,720 --> 00:02:40,119
Why are you everywhere?

71
00:02:40,399 --> 00:02:41,559
Are you a ghost?

72
00:02:43,360 --> 00:02:44,399
The moon is bright
and there are little stars.

73
00:02:44,399 --> 00:02:45,880
It's a perfect time
to view the moon.

74
00:02:45,880 --> 00:02:47,240
Why can't I be here?

75
00:02:48,800 --> 00:02:50,199
You're really something.

76
00:02:51,160 --> 00:02:52,279
Young Lady.

77
00:02:52,279 --> 00:02:53,160
Why do I feel

78
00:02:53,160 --> 00:02:55,520
like His Highness just wants
to view the moon with you?

79
00:02:56,960 --> 00:02:58,399
You've definitely mistaken this.

80
00:02:58,759 --> 00:02:59,759
The guy wants nothing more

81
00:02:59,759 --> 00:03:02,080
than kicking me out
of the Prince's Residence.

82
00:03:02,160 --> 00:03:03,080
Xiu'er.

83
00:03:03,080 --> 00:03:03,800
Let's go.

84
00:03:08,119 --> 00:03:09,679
You own quite a lot of outfits.

85
00:03:09,800 --> 00:03:11,080
You're so hardworking at changing them.

86
00:03:18,479 --> 00:03:20,000
Tonight's moon

87
00:03:20,839 --> 00:03:22,119
is huge.

88
00:03:22,520 --> 00:03:23,399
Huge...

89
00:03:33,140 --> 00:03:34,880
(Why-fry, Komputer, Ice-Krim,
Mobile fon, Empty Bars)

90
00:03:34,880 --> 00:03:35,600
Your Highness.

91
00:03:35,720 --> 00:03:37,759
You approached Her Highness
several times in the past few days.

92
00:03:38,240 --> 00:03:39,119
Did you find anything?

93
00:03:39,600 --> 00:03:40,479
That woman

94
00:03:41,199 --> 00:03:43,080
has all sorts of strange things

95
00:03:43,080 --> 00:03:44,080
in her head.

96
00:03:45,119 --> 00:03:46,080
Look at these terms.

97
00:03:46,639 --> 00:03:48,600
I have no idea what they mean.

98
00:03:54,639 --> 00:03:55,639
"Why-fry".

99
00:03:56,080 --> 00:03:56,800
"Empty bars".

100
00:03:58,559 --> 00:03:59,679
"Mobile fon".

101
00:04:00,360 --> 00:04:02,160
"Mekdonald".

102
00:04:08,039 --> 00:04:08,520
Here.

103
00:04:08,759 --> 00:04:09,320
Have a seat.

104
00:04:13,520 --> 00:04:14,720
What do you think?

105
00:04:21,559 --> 00:04:22,720
"Why-fry"

106
00:04:22,959 --> 00:04:24,559
is obviously a dish.

107
00:04:26,079 --> 00:04:27,119
This...

108
00:04:27,399 --> 00:04:29,160
"Empty bars", "komputer"...

109
00:04:31,320 --> 00:04:32,160
I haven't heard of them before.

110
00:04:33,720 --> 00:04:35,119
Also this.

111
00:04:35,880 --> 00:04:36,799
"Yuan Ju"...

112
00:04:37,200 --> 00:04:38,200
"Yuan Ju"...

113
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:39,600
"Yuan Ju Qing".

114
00:04:39,600 --> 00:04:40,839
Yes.

115
00:04:41,119 --> 00:04:42,079
"Yuan Ju Qing"?

116
00:04:42,760 --> 00:04:43,640
I haven't heard of this before.

117
00:04:46,559 --> 00:04:47,760
I assume

118
00:04:48,040 --> 00:04:48,959
"Yuan Ju Qing"

119
00:04:49,279 --> 00:04:50,519
is a person's name.

120
00:04:50,959 --> 00:04:51,799
Besides,

121
00:04:52,160 --> 00:04:53,320
I've overheard this name

122
00:04:53,320 --> 00:04:55,720
in the woman's mind multiple times.

123
00:04:57,760 --> 00:04:58,760
This man...

124
00:04:58,760 --> 00:05:00,239
His name is round

125
00:05:00,600 --> 00:05:01,760
and huge.

126
00:05:02,920 --> 00:05:04,679
He's obviously not a good person.

127
00:05:05,959 --> 00:05:07,559
I have no idea who this guy is,

128
00:05:08,160 --> 00:05:09,959
but I'm sure
he has a special relationship

129
00:05:10,079 --> 00:05:11,200
with Mu Xiaoxi.

130
00:05:11,440 --> 00:05:13,160
I guess someone's guiding Mu Xiaoxi

131
00:05:13,279 --> 00:05:15,079
on many things she did.

132
00:05:15,279 --> 00:05:17,000
We must investigate her background

133
00:05:17,119 --> 00:05:18,600
and find out what their agenda is.

134
00:05:19,040 --> 00:05:19,640
Yes.

135
00:05:22,160 --> 00:05:22,880
Your Highness.

136
00:05:25,880 --> 00:05:27,079
Prince Tan is asking for an audience.

137
00:05:28,760 --> 00:05:29,640
Send him in.

138
00:05:29,880 --> 00:05:30,480
Yes.

139
00:05:33,440 --> 00:05:34,679
He's finally here.
