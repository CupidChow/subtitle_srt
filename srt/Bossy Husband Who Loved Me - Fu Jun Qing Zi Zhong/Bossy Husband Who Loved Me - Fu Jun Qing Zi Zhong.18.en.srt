00:01:05,480 --> 00:01:06,559
What just happened?

3
00:01:06,760 --> 00:01:07,800
Did he

4
00:01:08,559 --> 00:01:10,199
just kiss me?

5
00:01:17,279 --> 00:01:19,000
Who was drunk? Him or me?

6
00:01:22,720 --> 00:01:24,120
We haven't figured out
who "Yuan Ju Qing" is,

7
00:01:24,120 --> 00:01:25,480
and now there is "Aunt Flo".

8
00:01:31,680 --> 00:01:32,480
Your Majesty.

9
00:01:32,639 --> 00:01:33,239
Could it be

10
00:01:33,239 --> 00:01:35,400
a distant relative of the Mu family?

11
00:01:38,080 --> 00:01:39,480
I haven't heard of her before.

12
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:41,120
This is weird.

13
00:01:41,120 --> 00:01:42,760
Who actually is

14
00:01:44,199 --> 00:01:45,839
"Aunt Flo"?

15
00:01:50,239 --> 00:01:51,040
Your Highness.

16
00:01:52,160 --> 00:01:52,800
Your Highness.

17
00:01:55,760 --> 00:01:56,639
Did you

18
00:01:56,959 --> 00:01:57,959
kiss her

19
00:01:58,639 --> 00:01:59,480
yesterday night?

20
00:02:01,319 --> 00:02:03,120
Tell me now. Quick.

21
00:02:03,120 --> 00:02:04,480
We're alone.

22
00:02:04,480 --> 00:02:05,400
Hurry up.

23
00:02:14,839 --> 00:02:15,320
Then...

24
00:02:15,639 --> 00:02:17,440
Why didn't you tell me earlier

25
00:02:17,520 --> 00:02:18,800
that you have regained your ability?

26
00:02:18,800 --> 00:02:20,399
Just approach her and try it out.

27
00:02:20,600 --> 00:02:22,240
Why did you have to make it so difficult
for me?

28
00:02:33,240 --> 00:02:34,639
This makes no sense.

29
00:02:35,119 --> 00:02:36,399
In my novel,

30
00:02:36,399 --> 00:02:37,479
Qin Chuan finds Mu Xiaoxi

31
00:02:37,479 --> 00:02:39,080
a complete nuisance.

32
00:02:39,559 --> 00:02:41,279
Why would he kiss me?

33
00:02:42,199 --> 00:02:44,440
The plot is making no sense.

34
00:02:45,279 --> 00:02:46,880
Did he know

35
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:48,320
that I was aware of his intention

36
00:02:48,320 --> 00:02:50,559
to make me drunk?

37
00:02:51,119 --> 00:02:52,559
Did he try to use my trick against me

38
00:02:52,559 --> 00:02:53,520
to take revenge on me?

39
00:02:55,399 --> 00:02:57,160
But this doesn't look like revenge.

40

41

43
00:03:00,559 --> 00:03:02,240
Young Lady, what are you doing here?

44
00:03:02,240 --> 00:03:03,279
I spent a long time looking for you.

45

49
00:03:15,479 --> 00:03:17,039

yesterday night.

everything you did yesterday night.

89
00:05:06,959 --> 00:05:08,320
Wait.

90
00:05:08,839 --> 00:05:10,000
Her Highness

91
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:11,359
didn't look upset this time.

92
00:05:11,799 --> 00:05:12,519
This is a good sign.

93
00:05:13,519 --> 00:05:14,279
It's a good sign.

94
00:05:14,959 --> 00:05:15,679
Your Highness.

95
00:05:15,679 --> 00:05:16,559
You should go now.

96
00:05:16,559 --> 00:05:17,399
Now.

97
00:05:17,519 --> 00:05:18,959
You need to be more proactive.

98

Once Her Highness realizes
that you care for her,

99

she'll feel more comfortable
to share her worries with you.

You're right.

101

Before we got married,

102
00:05:30,320 --> 00:05:31,839
she asked me out

103
00:05:31,839 --> 00:05:33,640
to Shuyuan Square several times

104
00:05:33,640 --> 00:05:35,239
to visit the lantern fair
and the night market.

105
00:05:36,440 --> 00:05:38,079
Let's fulfill her wish today.

106
00:05:38,359 --> 00:05:39,559
Your Highness is so smart.

107
00:05:41,200 --> 00:05:41,679

108
00:05:41,760 --> 00:05:42,279
Let's go.

110
00:06:09,399 --> 00:06:10,640
What are you thinking?

111
00:06:10,959 --> 00:06:12,320
Calm down.

112
00:06:12,399 --> 00:06:14,119
You haven't accomplished
your mission yet.

113
00:06:15,079 --> 00:06:16,320
The guy

114
00:06:17,079 --> 00:06:18,799
is quite handsome.

115
00:06:19,160 --> 00:06:20,480
I won't be able to stand this any longer

116
00:06:21,320 --> 00:06:22,959
if he keeps doing this.

117
00:06:27,399 --> 00:06:28,200
No.

118
00:06:28,959 --> 00:06:30,640
I have to remind him again.

119
00:06:37,920 --> 00:06:41,000
(Know your place!)

122
00:06:53,640 --> 00:06:55,160

Yes.

Know your place.

126
00:07:06,519 --> 00:07:07,559

Your Highness.

128
00:07:12,279 --> 00:07:14,119
What is this?

129
00:07:15,239 --> 00:07:16,040
A stroke.

130

135

Her Highness

136
00:07:27,720 --> 00:07:28,399
wants to confirm the venue

139

is obviously interested in me.
