2
00:00:09,279 --> 00:00:09,760
Here.

3
00:00:09,920 --> 00:00:10,840
Try this.

4
00:00:12,119 --> 00:00:13,560
This tastes good too.

5
00:00:13,560 --> 00:00:14,560
Try them all.

6
00:00:15,840 --> 00:00:16,280
Here.

7
00:00:18,159 --> 00:00:19,559
Thank you for preparing a feast

8
00:00:19,639 --> 00:00:20,520
for me.

9
00:00:20,840 --> 00:00:21,879
It's not a big deal.

10
00:00:21,879 --> 00:00:23,280
Your Highness is the one
who has been working hard.

11
00:00:23,399 --> 00:00:24,920
Your Highness has to handle
the national affairs every day.

12
00:00:24,920 --> 00:00:26,120
It must be really tiring for you.

13
00:00:26,719 --> 00:00:27,440
If it wasn't for you,

14
00:00:27,440 --> 00:00:28,440
I would never have found out

15
00:00:28,440 --> 00:00:29,479
that Miss Liu

16
00:00:29,680 --> 00:00:31,319
was actually a spy from Beiqing.

17
00:00:31,559 --> 00:00:32,200
Your Highness.

18
00:00:32,200 --> 00:00:33,439
You're really impressive.

19
00:00:33,439 --> 00:00:34,560
How did you find out about that?

20
00:00:36,639 --> 00:00:38,200
It doesn't matter
how I discovered that.

21
00:00:38,560 --> 00:00:39,759
What bothers me the most

22
00:00:40,200 --> 00:00:41,880
is the fact that she has been working
for someone else.

23
00:00:42,439 --> 00:00:43,439
But fret not.

24
00:00:43,599 --> 00:00:45,080
Whoever that man is,

25
00:00:45,200 --> 00:00:46,840
I'll definitely find him.

26
00:00:49,159 --> 00:00:50,880
She's working for someone else?

27
00:00:54,479 --> 00:00:55,639
That can't be true.

28
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:57,799
Shangguan Ruyu should be the only person

29
00:00:57,799 --> 00:00:58,759
involved in this.

30
00:00:59,319 --> 00:01:00,880
Who else could she be working for?

31
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:03,479
Xi.

32
00:01:05,040 --> 00:01:06,599
Do you have anything
you want to tell me?

33
00:01:08,440 --> 00:01:09,400
No.

34
00:01:12,040 --> 00:01:12,959
But

35
00:01:13,480 --> 00:01:14,639
has Your Highness

36
00:01:14,639 --> 00:01:16,319
heard any strange terms

37
00:01:16,959 --> 00:01:18,440
recently?

38
00:01:18,559 --> 00:01:19,599
For example...

39
00:01:20,639 --> 00:01:21,680
Yuan...

40
00:01:29,800 --> 00:01:30,599
No.

41
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:31,800
No?

42
00:01:34,040 --> 00:01:34,839
I haven't.

43
00:01:37,239 --> 00:01:38,080
No?

44
00:01:39,680 --> 00:01:40,720
No?

45
00:01:42,199 --> 00:01:44,160
Xi, are you interested

46
00:01:44,559 --> 00:01:45,720
in the Yuan thing?

47
00:01:46,720 --> 00:01:47,519
No.

48
00:01:48,160 --> 00:01:49,319
Of course, not.

49
00:01:49,959 --> 00:01:51,800
Why would I be interested in it?

50
00:01:52,199 --> 00:01:52,839
Let's eat.

51
00:01:52,839 --> 00:01:54,480
Let's dig in.

52
00:01:59,120 --> 00:02:00,319
Have you reconsidered it?

53
00:02:00,720 --> 00:02:02,360
I'm giving you one last chance.

54
00:02:02,720 --> 00:02:03,680
Are you going to come clean or not?

55
00:02:03,919 --> 00:02:05,160
I told you

56
00:02:05,639 --> 00:02:07,559
I have no idea who is "Yuan Ju Qing".

57
00:02:14,320 --> 00:02:15,119
What are you doing?

58
00:02:16,839 --> 00:02:17,919
What are you doing?

59
00:02:24,880 --> 00:02:26,600
If you don't consume the antidote
within the next four hours,

60
00:02:26,800 --> 00:02:28,080
Shangguan Ruyu

61
00:02:28,080 --> 00:02:30,279
will vanish from this world.

62
00:02:30,600 --> 00:02:31,399
Your Highness.

63
00:02:31,600 --> 00:02:32,960
For the antidote,

64
00:02:32,960 --> 00:02:34,119
just tell us the truth.

65
00:02:35,199 --> 00:02:36,160
Do you want to confess now?

66
00:02:36,240 --> 00:02:37,119
Fine.

67
00:02:37,320 --> 00:02:38,440
I'll tell you the truth.

68
00:02:38,440 --> 00:02:39,679
I'll tell you the truth.

69
00:02:42,080 --> 00:02:43,399
"Yuan Ju Qing".

70
00:02:43,759 --> 00:02:44,759
I know him.

71
00:02:45,360 --> 00:02:47,520
He works for
the Secret Service of Beiqing.

72
00:02:49,479 --> 00:02:50,679
I was right.

73
00:02:51,759 --> 00:02:53,559
How did he manage

74
00:02:53,559 --> 00:02:56,000
to get Mu Xiaoxi to work for Beiqing?

75
00:02:56,399 --> 00:02:59,000
Mu Xiaoxi is working for Beiqing?

76
00:02:59,600 --> 00:03:00,440
Stop playing the fool.

77
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:02,679
Yes. You're right.

78
00:03:02,800 --> 00:03:04,479
Too bad,

79
00:03:04,479 --> 00:03:06,039
Mu Xiaoxi is a lascivious girl.

80
00:03:06,199 --> 00:03:07,160
That was how

81
00:03:07,160 --> 00:03:08,479
"Yuan Ju Qing" got to manipulate her.

82
00:03:08,479 --> 00:03:10,360
She would do everything for him.

83
00:03:10,600 --> 00:03:12,000
As you know,

84
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:13,800
once

85
00:03:13,960 --> 00:03:15,800
we fall for someone,

86
00:03:15,960 --> 00:03:17,039
we will do everything

87
00:03:17,160 --> 00:03:18,919
for our lovers.

88
00:03:19,240 --> 00:03:20,479
Rubbish.

89
00:03:20,639 --> 00:03:22,240
Do you think I'll believe your words?

90
00:03:22,320 --> 00:03:23,919
I was telling the truth.

91
00:03:24,440 --> 00:03:25,600
"Yuan Ju Qing"

92
00:03:25,600 --> 00:03:27,360
is a very good-looking

93
00:03:27,360 --> 00:03:29,279
- gentleman.
- That's enough.

94
00:03:35,320 --> 00:03:36,679
Who is "Aunt Flo"?

95
00:03:36,919 --> 00:03:38,800
"Aunt Flo"?

96
00:03:39,320 --> 00:03:40,720
She was the matchmaker

97
00:03:40,720 --> 00:03:42,000
who brought them together.

98
00:03:43,160 --> 00:03:44,759
And where is "Sea dungeon"?

99
00:03:45,479 --> 00:03:48,000
It's their secret meeting place.

100
00:03:48,279 --> 00:03:49,639
And what is "Ji Gong Bao"?

101
00:03:49,720 --> 00:03:50,639
It's their token of love.

102
00:03:50,759 --> 00:03:51,520
What is a "Bad Omen"?

103
00:03:51,520 --> 00:03:52,320
Bad...

104
00:03:52,759 --> 00:03:54,919
"Bad Omen"?

105
00:03:54,919 --> 00:03:56,320
This...

106
00:03:57,559 --> 00:03:58,440
Your Highness.

107
00:03:58,600 --> 00:04:00,039
I really have no idea.

108
00:04:00,039 --> 00:04:01,440
Please just let me go.

109
00:04:04,759 --> 00:04:06,240
That's enough.

110
00:04:07,679 --> 00:04:08,600
Qin Chuan.

111
00:04:08,839 --> 00:04:10,080
Are you going to leave me like this,
Qin Chuan?

112
00:04:12,199 --> 00:04:13,360
What about my antidote?

113
00:04:18,279 --> 00:04:19,119
Antidote?

114
00:04:21,640 --> 00:04:23,119
It was just plain water.

115
00:04:24,920 --> 00:04:26,559
Jerks!

116
00:04:51,200 --> 00:04:53,040
Xi, are you interested

117
00:04:53,679 --> 00:04:54,480
in this Yuan thing?

118
00:04:54,480 --> 00:04:55,040
No.

119
00:04:55,359 --> 00:04:56,519
Of course, not.

120
00:04:56,799 --> 00:04:58,480
Unfortunately,

121
00:04:58,480 --> 00:04:59,920
Mu Xiaoxi is a lascivious girl.

122
00:05:00,079 --> 00:05:02,000
As we all know,

123
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:03,640
once

124
00:05:03,760 --> 00:05:05,359
we fall for someone,

125
00:05:05,760 --> 00:05:06,920
we will do everything

126
00:05:07,079 --> 00:05:09,079
for our lovers.

127
00:05:26,880 --> 00:05:28,239
It's making no sense.

128
00:05:29,160 --> 00:05:31,680
Why would he know anything about
the original storyline?

129
00:05:32,640 --> 00:05:33,720
Did I accidentally

130
00:05:34,160 --> 00:05:35,600
blurt it out?

131
00:05:36,799 --> 00:05:38,440
It's just making no sense.

132
00:05:39,239 --> 00:05:40,519
Did I

133
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:42,640
overanalyze it?

134
00:05:42,959 --> 00:05:45,359
The "Yuan Ju Qing" he's talking about

135
00:05:45,679 --> 00:05:46,720
is, in fact,

136
00:05:46,799 --> 00:05:48,279
not the original storyline

137
00:05:48,279 --> 00:05:49,359
I am talking about.

138
00:05:52,200 --> 00:05:53,000
No.

139
00:05:53,440 --> 00:05:54,959
I need to find the answer.
