00:00:13,119 --> 00:00:14,399
(Mu's Residence)
Here. Let's drink.

3
00:00:14,600 --> 00:00:15,119
Cheers.

4
00:00:33,159 --> 00:00:33,680
Your Highness.

5
00:00:34,520 --> 00:00:35,439
Criminal, Xu Dayou,

6
00:00:35,720 --> 00:00:36,759
is here to greet Prince Rui.

7
00:00:39,680 --> 00:00:40,319
Get up.

8
00:00:40,479 --> 00:00:41,119
Don't worry.

9
00:00:41,279 --> 00:00:42,119
Thanks, Your Highness.

10
00:00:43,159 --> 00:00:44,360
I'm sure you're aware

11
00:00:44,919 --> 00:00:45,840
of how serious this issue is.

12
00:00:46,439 --> 00:00:47,639
What's your plan now?

13
00:00:47,639 --> 00:00:48,799
If it wasn't for Your Highness,

14
00:00:48,919 --> 00:00:50,479
I would've long been killed by now.

15
00:00:50,680 --> 00:00:51,599
I would be an absolute disappointment

16
00:00:51,720 --> 00:00:52,840
if I still don't wake up by now.

17
00:00:53,200 --> 00:00:54,919
I have a ledger with me.

18
00:00:55,159 --> 00:00:56,799
It has all the trading records

19
00:00:56,799 --> 00:00:57,959
and evidence of the bribes
the corrupted officials received.

20
00:00:58,279 --> 00:00:59,400
I can hand it to Your Highness.

21
00:00:59,799 --> 00:01:00,799
I only hope

22
00:01:00,799 --> 00:01:02,279
that Your Highness can spare me.

23
00:01:02,319 --> 00:01:04,559
That's good.

24
00:01:05,279 --> 00:01:06,440
According to our country's rules,

25
00:01:06,440 --> 00:01:07,559
you'll be leniently treated
if you're honest.

26
00:01:08,199 --> 00:01:09,199
If you can make a contribution,

27
00:01:09,440 --> 00:01:10,599
they will go easy on the punishment.

28
00:01:11,199 --> 00:01:11,680
Yes.

29
00:01:18,800 --> 00:01:19,360
Your Highness,

30
00:01:19,559 --> 00:01:20,400
it's about to rain soon.

31
00:01:20,599 --> 00:01:21,879
There's an abandoned temple nearby.

32
00:01:21,879 --> 00:01:23,080
Let's take hiding there.

33
00:01:33,199 --> 00:01:34,559
Fortunately, there's no leakage here.

34
00:01:35,919 --> 00:01:37,080
This is insane.

35
00:01:37,080 --> 00:01:38,199
It started to rain without any warning.

36
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:42,239
It's really raining.

37
00:01:44,040 --> 00:01:45,360
I can't believe this.

38
00:01:45,959 --> 00:01:46,519
Huh?

39
00:01:47,440 --> 00:01:48,080
Your Highness,

40
00:01:48,400 --> 00:01:50,480
did you know that it was going to rain?

41
00:01:54,839 --> 00:01:55,519
Where is Shopkeeper Xu?

42
00:01:55,519 --> 00:01:55,879
Oh.

43
00:01:56,120 --> 00:01:57,400
He excused himself to the washroom.

44
00:02:00,720 --> 00:02:01,160
Oh, no.

45
00:02:01,680 --> 00:02:02,120
What?

46
00:02:08,320 --> 00:02:08,759
Come here.

47
00:02:18,720 --> 00:02:20,279
Thanks, Lord Zhao, for saving my life.

48
00:02:20,279 --> 00:02:22,679
Otherwise, I would've been killed
by the lightning.

49
00:02:22,679 --> 00:02:23,720
You need to thank His Highness.

50
00:02:23,800 --> 00:02:24,800
It was His Highness who saved you.

51
00:02:25,399 --> 00:02:26,679
Your Highness was able
to foresee the future

52
00:02:26,720 --> 00:02:27,839
and saved my life.

53
00:02:27,839 --> 00:02:29,919
I would do anything
to repay Your Highness' kindness.

54
00:02:31,160 --> 00:02:33,240
(He almost got struck by lightning.)

55
00:02:33,960 --> 00:02:35,119
(I can't believe this.)

56
00:02:44,559 --> 00:02:46,320
Why do you keep peeking at me?

57
00:02:47,679 --> 00:02:48,600
I'm enjoying the scenery.

58
00:02:48,600 --> 00:02:49,720
You can enjoy the scenery all you want

59
00:02:49,720 --> 00:02:51,240
through the window over there.

60
00:02:51,520 --> 00:02:53,119
Why do you keep looking in my direction?

61
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:00,479
Zhao Tie.

62
00:03:00,479 --> 00:03:01,279
Yes?

63
00:03:01,399 --> 00:03:03,440
How are things going with Shopkeeper Xu?

64
00:03:03,559 --> 00:03:04,320
Don't worry, Your Highness.

65
00:03:04,320 --> 00:03:06,000
I've got everything arranged.

66
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:07,839
Shopkeeper Xu will send us
the ledger soon.

67
00:03:08,800 --> 00:03:09,759
Shopkeeper Xu...

68
00:03:10,559 --> 00:03:12,119
Is he not dead yet?

69
00:03:12,600 --> 00:03:13,399
Who?

70
00:03:15,559 --> 00:03:16,240
Huh?

71
00:03:16,320 --> 00:03:17,240
Nothing.

72
00:03:17,399 --> 00:03:19,679
I'm just talking to myself.
You can ignore me.

73
00:03:21,559 --> 00:03:22,639
(Wait.)

74
00:03:22,639 --> 00:03:24,039
(According to the original storyline,)

75
00:03:24,039 --> 00:03:25,880
(Shopkeeper Xu should be
struck to death by the lightning.)

76
00:03:27,160 --> 00:03:29,279
The ledger was the key evidence.

77
00:03:29,399 --> 00:03:31,360
Qin Chuan was supposed
to work very hard

78
00:03:31,360 --> 00:03:32,559
to get the ledger.

79
00:03:33,320 --> 00:03:35,000
What's going on?

80
00:03:36,080 --> 00:03:37,199
"Yuan Ju Qing"?

81
00:03:38,720 --> 00:03:40,000
What did you say?

82
00:03:40,600 --> 00:03:41,279
Nothing.

83
00:03:42,039 --> 00:03:43,360
I'm talking to myself as well.

84
00:03:44,399 --> 00:03:44,839
All right.

85
00:03:55,119 --> 00:03:55,919
Your Highness.

86
00:03:57,520 --> 00:03:58,520
(Ledger)
We've got the ledger.

87
00:04:01,600 --> 00:04:03,639
Shopkeeper Xu insisted that I help him

88
00:04:03,639 --> 00:04:04,479
extend his gratitude to Your Highness.

89
00:04:10,320 --> 00:04:11,119
Great.

90
00:04:15,639 --> 00:04:16,200
Your Highness.

91
00:04:17,239 --> 00:04:17,880
Your Highness.

92
00:04:18,880 --> 00:04:20,799
I'm very curious about something.

93
00:04:21,720 --> 00:04:22,399
How did you

94
00:04:22,519 --> 00:04:23,880
find out

95
00:04:23,920 --> 00:04:25,519
where the thunder would strike?

96
00:04:26,640 --> 00:04:27,839
If I tell you

97
00:04:28,559 --> 00:04:30,679
I can read the woman's mind,

98
00:04:30,839 --> 00:04:31,839
will you believe me?

99
00:04:31,959 --> 00:04:32,760
Hmm...

100
00:04:33,640 --> 00:04:34,119
Huh?

101
00:04:34,880 --> 00:04:35,839
You can read her mind?

102
00:04:39,440 --> 00:04:40,040
But...

103
00:04:40,399 --> 00:04:42,040
Doesn't reading mind

104
00:04:42,040 --> 00:04:43,959
sound like a quackery trick?

105
00:04:47,440 --> 00:04:49,119
I find it unbelievable too.

106
00:04:50,440 --> 00:04:51,320
But

107
00:04:51,880 --> 00:04:52,839
it rained on a sunny day,

108
00:04:53,359 --> 00:04:54,440
the witness went to the washroom,

109
00:04:54,839 --> 00:04:56,320
and almost got struck by lightning.

110
00:04:56,720 --> 00:04:58,959
I learned all that
by reading the woman's mind.

111
00:05:00,760 --> 00:05:02,160
It's the fact.

112
00:05:02,720 --> 00:05:03,839
I have no choice but to believe it.

113
00:05:06,600 --> 00:05:07,480
That means

114
00:05:07,480 --> 00:05:10,239
Your Highness overheard
Her Highness' thoughts

115
00:05:10,440 --> 00:05:12,000
and saved Shopkeeper Xu's life.

116
00:05:12,279 --> 00:05:14,600
But how did Her Highness find out
about this?

117
00:05:18,320 --> 00:05:19,399
I've no idea too.

118
00:05:20,959 --> 00:05:21,359
Your Highness.

119
00:05:22,239 --> 00:05:22,720
Your Highness.

120
00:05:23,640 --> 00:05:26,880
Can you read everyone's mind?

121
00:05:26,880 --> 00:05:28,679
Or only Her Highness'?

122
00:05:29,160 --> 00:05:30,600
Why don't you give it a try now?

123
00:05:30,600 --> 00:05:32,239
Can you hear my thoughts?

124
00:05:50,640 --> 00:05:52,399
Nothing. I can't hear anything.

125
00:05:53,760 --> 00:05:55,399
That's impressive, Your Highness.

126
00:05:55,760 --> 00:05:57,559
I wasn't thinking anything just now.

127
00:06:04,880 --> 00:06:05,320
Then...

128
00:06:06,160 --> 00:06:08,320
What should we do next?

129
00:06:09,600 --> 00:06:10,359
I must

130
00:06:11,320 --> 00:06:12,760
figure this out.
