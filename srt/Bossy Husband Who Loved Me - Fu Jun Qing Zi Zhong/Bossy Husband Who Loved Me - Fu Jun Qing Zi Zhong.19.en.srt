2
00:00:15,079 --> 00:00:16,200
Your Highness.

3
00:00:16,600 --> 00:00:18,719
We received a notice
from Qin Chuan, Prince Rui.

4
00:00:19,280 --> 00:00:21,079
The Sheng decided to pull out
from the peace negotiation.

5
00:00:21,280 --> 00:00:23,159
They're going to continue
with the war at the Northern border.

6
00:00:23,280 --> 00:00:24,399
I'm afraid we won't gain anything

7
00:00:24,600 --> 00:00:25,920
from this expedition.

8
00:00:26,159 --> 00:00:29,479
The artisans from the Sheng
are really skillful.

9
00:00:30,120 --> 00:00:31,559
The bronze mirror they made

10
00:00:31,559 --> 00:00:34,000
is able to show my beauty

11
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:35,959
flawlessly.

12
00:00:36,639 --> 00:00:37,799
Your Highness.

13
00:00:39,840 --> 00:00:40,919
I heard you.

14
00:00:41,959 --> 00:00:44,759
They have the upper hand
in the war at the Northern border.

15
00:00:44,759 --> 00:00:46,240
Of course, they're reluctant
to negotiate for peace.

16
00:00:47,479 --> 00:00:49,479
The spy Beiqing planted
in the Capital of Sheng

17
00:00:49,479 --> 00:00:51,279
has already brought me the news.

18
00:00:51,520 --> 00:00:53,159
It's said that the Sheng will soon
deploy 100,000 troops

19
00:00:53,159 --> 00:00:55,599
to the Northern border
as reinforcement.

20
00:00:56,279 --> 00:00:58,200
And Qin Chuan

21
00:00:58,200 --> 00:00:59,759
will be the Commanding General.

22
00:01:00,599 --> 00:01:01,520
It's said

23
00:01:01,520 --> 00:01:04,000
that Qin Chuan is
both intelligent and fit.

24
00:01:04,199 --> 00:01:05,839
He's also perfect leader material.

25
00:01:05,919 --> 00:01:07,919
If he's going to lead the troop
at the war,

26
00:01:08,400 --> 00:01:09,519
it'll put Beiqing

27
00:01:09,720 --> 00:01:11,120
at an absolute disadvantage.

28
00:01:12,599 --> 00:01:13,760
Qin Chuan

29
00:01:13,760 --> 00:01:15,319
is really a nuisance.

30
00:01:16,720 --> 00:01:17,919
However,

31
00:01:18,599 --> 00:01:21,239
if people find out

32
00:01:21,559 --> 00:01:24,639
that Prince Rui has an affair
with a Beiqing woman

33
00:01:24,879 --> 00:01:26,199
before he sets off for war,

34
00:01:26,680 --> 00:01:27,760
do you think

35
00:01:27,839 --> 00:01:30,160
he'll still be elected

36
00:01:30,160 --> 00:01:32,120
as the Commanding General?

37
00:01:33,120 --> 00:01:34,279
Are you saying

38
00:01:34,440 --> 00:01:35,639
that we should set up a badger game
for him?

39
00:01:39,239 --> 00:01:40,440
I was right.

40
00:01:40,760 --> 00:01:43,360
Without Qin Chuan by my side,

41
00:01:43,440 --> 00:01:44,440
even the air

42
00:01:44,440 --> 00:01:45,959
smells sweeter.

43
00:01:49,919 --> 00:01:50,720
Wow.

44
00:01:51,120 --> 00:01:52,879
What a beautiful lantern.

45
00:02:04,919 --> 00:02:05,800
Your Highness.

46
00:02:06,040 --> 00:02:08,080
Her Highness is looking around.

47
00:02:08,080 --> 00:02:09,839
She's obviously waiting
for your arrival.

48
00:02:26,600 --> 00:02:27,399
This is interesting.

49
00:02:32,240 --> 00:02:32,839
Miss.

50
00:02:32,839 --> 00:02:33,880
Are you all right?

51
00:02:35,160 --> 00:02:36,199
Sorry.

52
00:02:36,199 --> 00:02:37,160
It was my mistake.

53
00:02:39,240 --> 00:02:40,479
Let me help you up first.

54
00:02:41,160 --> 00:02:42,720
Excuse me.

55
00:02:46,720 --> 00:02:47,520
What's the matter?

56
00:02:47,520 --> 00:02:49,279
I have apologized to you.

57
00:02:49,440 --> 00:02:51,360
Why did Elder Sister
have to push me still?

58
00:02:51,720 --> 00:02:53,000
I didn't.

59
00:02:54,720 --> 00:02:55,600
Mu Xiaoxi.

60
00:02:56,119 --> 00:02:57,800
You've triggered a new mission.

61
00:02:58,320 --> 00:02:59,600
Your target

62
00:02:59,600 --> 00:03:01,119
is to work with the princess of Beiqing,

63
00:03:01,119 --> 00:03:03,160
so that you can catch them in bed.

64
00:03:03,479 --> 00:03:05,759
Put the princess of Beiqing
and Qin Chuan

65
00:03:05,759 --> 00:03:07,039
in the same room,

66
00:03:07,839 --> 00:03:08,520
then

67
00:03:08,679 --> 00:03:10,240
catch them in bed.

68
00:03:10,639 --> 00:03:12,559
The princess of Beiqing?

69
00:03:14,360 --> 00:03:15,600
She is Shangguan Ruyu?

70
00:03:15,960 --> 00:03:16,839
According to the original storyline,

71
00:03:16,839 --> 00:03:18,479
she is a cunning witch.

72
00:03:18,479 --> 00:03:19,919
(To tarnish Qin Chuan's name,)

73
00:03:19,919 --> 00:03:21,919
(she tries to approach Qin Chuan
by setting up a trap for Mu Xiaoxi.)

74
00:03:21,919 --> 00:03:24,119
Then, she put the two of them
in the same room

75
00:03:24,119 --> 00:03:26,199
and send a message to Mu Xiaoxi
to inform her about this.

76
00:03:26,199 --> 00:03:27,960
She wants her to catch them in bed.

77
00:03:28,839 --> 00:03:30,399
(How cunning.)

78
00:03:31,039 --> 00:03:31,639
Sure.

79
00:03:31,759 --> 00:03:33,119
To complete my mission,

80
00:03:33,119 --> 00:03:34,440
I'll put on an act for you.

81
00:03:35,039 --> 00:03:35,639
Yes.

82
00:03:36,639 --> 00:03:37,600
I did this.

83
00:03:37,919 --> 00:03:38,839
I pushed her.

84
00:03:38,839 --> 00:03:39,520
What's wrong with that?

85
00:03:39,520 --> 00:03:40,320
Are you upset?

86
00:03:40,960 --> 00:03:41,720
I am

87
00:03:41,720 --> 00:03:43,039
Princess Consort Rui.

88
00:03:43,199 --> 00:03:44,199
And he

89
00:03:44,199 --> 00:03:45,960
is Prince Rui.

90
00:03:48,199 --> 00:03:50,960
Your Highnesses.

91
00:03:51,520 --> 00:03:53,720
It was my fault.

92
00:03:54,279 --> 00:03:55,759
I shouldn't have stood
in Your Highness' way.

93
00:03:56,039 --> 00:03:57,119
I understand

94
00:03:57,119 --> 00:03:58,880
why Your Highness is angry with me.

95
00:04:00,119 --> 00:04:01,160
Your Highness.

96
00:04:01,160 --> 00:04:02,839
Please don't blame her.

97
00:04:03,880 --> 00:04:04,440
Brilliant.

98
00:04:04,880 --> 00:04:06,720
She is a perfect witch.

99
00:04:06,720 --> 00:04:07,399
(Hurry up.)

100
00:04:07,600 --> 00:04:08,639
(You should get mad at me now.)

101
00:04:10,479 --> 00:04:11,440
Since

102
00:04:11,639 --> 00:04:12,800
you've apologized,

103
00:04:12,800 --> 00:04:14,440
we won't pursue this matter further.

104
00:04:14,559 --> 00:04:15,160
Let's go.

105
00:04:15,520 --> 00:04:16,679
Are we leaving now?

106
00:04:17,799 --> 00:04:19,040
Don't you hate it

107
00:04:19,040 --> 00:04:20,279
when someone

108
00:04:20,279 --> 00:04:21,679
bullies the weak?

109
00:04:21,920 --> 00:04:23,359
People are watching us.

110
00:04:23,359 --> 00:04:24,600
If we leave now,

111
00:04:24,959 --> 00:04:26,920
it'll make you look bad.

112
00:04:28,959 --> 00:04:30,040
I think

113
00:04:30,720 --> 00:04:32,000
it's the husband's duty

114
00:04:32,559 --> 00:04:34,200
to protect the wife.

115
00:04:34,480 --> 00:04:35,480
Wait a minute.

116
00:04:38,959 --> 00:04:39,880
I thought about it

117
00:04:39,880 --> 00:04:41,160
just now.

118
00:04:41,279 --> 00:04:42,279
It was indeed

119
00:04:42,279 --> 00:04:43,440
my fault.

120
00:04:43,440 --> 00:04:44,160
Look.

121
00:04:46,279 --> 00:04:47,320
The rouge box

122
00:04:47,320 --> 00:04:48,519
is broken.

123
00:04:48,760 --> 00:04:50,640
There's a rouge store right in front.

124
00:04:50,959 --> 00:04:51,359
Let's go.

125
00:04:51,559 --> 00:04:52,200
Let me bring you there.

126
00:04:52,200 --> 00:04:53,239
We'll get you a new one.

127
00:04:53,239 --> 00:04:54,720
Let's go. It's just nearby.

128
00:04:54,720 --> 00:04:55,640
Come with me.

129
00:04:59,320 --> 00:05:00,160
Your Highness.

130
00:05:00,480 --> 00:05:01,720
What's going on?

131
00:05:03,480 --> 00:05:04,480
Beiqing?

132
00:05:06,200 --> 00:05:07,279
Miss Liu.

133
00:05:07,359 --> 00:05:08,359
You can pick anything you want.

134
00:05:08,480 --> 00:05:10,040
Let me know which one you like.

135
00:05:10,320 --> 00:05:11,679
Then, we'll have a little competition

136
00:05:12,640 --> 00:05:13,679
to find out

137
00:05:13,880 --> 00:05:15,119
who has

138
00:05:15,399 --> 00:05:16,200
better makeup skills.

139
00:05:17,320 --> 00:05:19,079
Your Highness' beauty is unparalleled.

140
00:05:19,359 --> 00:05:21,040
I'm just a commoner.

141
00:05:21,320 --> 00:05:22,720
How dare I compare my look
with yours?

142
00:05:24,040 --> 00:05:25,079
That's not true.

143
00:05:25,119 --> 00:05:26,279
We won't know who's better

144
00:05:26,279 --> 00:05:27,239
before we compare it.

145
00:05:37,839 --> 00:05:38,920
I'll let you win

146
00:05:38,920 --> 00:05:41,399
by a landslide.

147
00:05:41,399 --> 00:05:42,160
I am

148
00:05:42,160 --> 00:05:43,160
going all out.

149
00:05:57,200 --> 00:05:58,279
Miss Liu's makeup

150
00:05:58,279 --> 00:05:59,200
looks nice and fresh.

151
00:05:59,519 --> 00:06:00,720
It brings out your temperament.

152
00:06:01,160 --> 00:06:02,760
However, Princess Consort's makeup

153
00:06:03,119 --> 00:06:04,679
makes her look innocent, cute,

154
00:06:04,839 --> 00:06:06,079
and youthful.

155
00:06:06,359 --> 00:06:07,640
In my opinion,

156
00:06:07,640 --> 00:06:09,839
compared to Miss Liu's beautiful makeup,

157
00:06:10,119 --> 00:06:11,320
I actually prefer

158
00:06:11,320 --> 00:06:12,480
Princess Consort's makeup.

159
00:06:12,640 --> 00:06:13,480
Huh?

160
00:06:15,799 --> 00:06:16,920
She's pretty.

161
00:06:18,720 --> 00:06:19,760
Come with me.

162
00:06:21,600 --> 00:06:22,480
Miss Liu.

163
00:06:22,480 --> 00:06:23,679
Let us

164
00:06:24,559 --> 00:06:25,480
try this too.

165
00:06:27,160 --> 00:06:28,200
Unlike Your Highness,

166
00:06:28,200 --> 00:06:30,000
I'm not the daughter of a general.

167
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:32,000
This requires a lot of physical energy.

168
00:06:32,160 --> 00:06:34,320
There's no way I can beat
Your Highness in this.

169
00:06:36,920 --> 00:06:37,815
How cunning.

170
00:06:37,839 --> 00:06:38,959
I like how cunning you are.

171
00:06:39,079 --> 00:06:40,720
You're the best witch I've ever seen.

172
00:06:40,839 --> 00:06:41,640
Good job.

173
00:06:41,640 --> 00:06:43,679
(She's a coy woman.)

174
00:06:43,799 --> 00:06:45,440
(She can win every man's heart.)

175
00:06:46,119 --> 00:06:47,799
The Sheng is known
for our military power.

176
00:06:48,079 --> 00:06:49,880
We're all born warriors.

177
00:06:50,040 --> 00:06:52,559
Only a heroine like Princess Consort

178
00:06:52,720 --> 00:06:54,279
is praiseworthy.

179
00:06:57,640 --> 00:06:59,279
Your Highness is right.

180
00:06:59,559 --> 00:07:01,880
I wish to learn a few things
from Your Highness too.

181
00:07:02,119 --> 00:07:03,000
Perhaps

182
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:04,519
Your Highness can teach me
how to do this.

183
00:07:16,959 --> 00:07:18,519
I'm a married man.

184
00:07:19,760 --> 00:07:20,720
I will be Princess Consort's teacher.

185
00:07:22,160 --> 00:07:22,920
I'm fine.

186
00:07:23,760 --> 00:07:25,320
I can do it myself.

187
00:07:28,239 --> 00:07:29,079
Qin Chuan.

188
00:07:32,239 --> 00:07:33,040
Focus.

189
00:07:33,720 --> 00:07:35,119
I can do it on my own.

190
00:07:35,119 --> 00:07:36,279
Hold your breath.

191
00:07:36,399 --> 00:07:37,760
She needs some teaching.

192
00:07:37,839 --> 00:07:38,839
Steady the bow.

193
00:07:39,279 --> 00:07:40,160
Teach her.

194
00:07:40,160 --> 00:07:41,239
Hold your stance.
