=Bossy Husband Who Loved Me=
=Episode 14=

2
00:00:14,840 --> 00:00:15,920
No way...

3
00:00:16,559 --> 00:00:18,200
When I was writing
this part of the story,

4
00:00:19,079 --> 00:00:20,680
I wrote three poems for Qin Chuan.

5
00:00:20,680 --> 00:00:22,239
They're all famous poems
I copied from the internet.

6
00:00:22,440 --> 00:00:23,600
These are not the three poems.

7
00:00:25,920 --> 00:00:27,280
Did the plot change again?

8
00:00:32,959 --> 00:00:33,959
Previously,

9
00:00:33,959 --> 00:00:35,720
the ledger turned out to be fake.

10
00:00:36,639 --> 00:00:38,240
Qin Yu, the villain, was supposed

11
00:00:38,360 --> 00:00:40,040
to play a big part in the story.

12
00:00:40,040 --> 00:00:41,639
But he got cut off right away.

13
00:00:42,959 --> 00:00:43,840
This time,

14
00:00:44,919 --> 00:00:46,840
the poems have turned out
to be fake as well.

15
00:00:47,560 --> 00:00:49,720
Then, the Second Prince won't be able
to frame Qin Chuan.

16
00:00:50,880 --> 00:00:52,240
He's supposed to be the protagonist
of the angst fiction,

17
00:00:52,240 --> 00:00:54,319
but now he's having
the time of his life.

18
00:01:08,239 --> 00:01:09,879
Luckily, I have memorized a few poems.

19
00:01:10,279 --> 00:01:11,919
Let me write three new poems for you.

20
00:01:12,120 --> 00:01:13,519
Qin Chuan.

21
00:01:13,519 --> 00:01:14,639
I created you.

22
00:01:14,639 --> 00:01:16,000
There's no way you can run away from me.

23
00:01:30,959 --> 00:01:32,120
To govern a country,

24
00:01:32,680 --> 00:01:34,040
we need someone who's both
a good scholar and a good fighter.

25
00:01:34,639 --> 00:01:35,360
Today,

26
00:01:35,760 --> 00:01:37,120
we're going to judge your poetry.

27
00:01:37,400 --> 00:01:38,720
I will entrust

28
00:01:39,160 --> 00:01:39,720
the winner

29
00:01:39,720 --> 00:01:40,800
with important tasks.

30
00:01:41,239 --> 00:01:42,120
Now,

31
00:01:42,120 --> 00:01:43,559
it's spring.

32
00:01:43,800 --> 00:01:44,959
The theme of the first poem

33
00:01:44,959 --> 00:01:46,760
shall be spring.

34
00:01:48,120 --> 00:01:49,080
Yue.

35
00:01:49,279 --> 00:01:50,199
You'll go first.

36
00:01:50,440 --> 00:01:51,559
Yes, Your Majesty.

37
00:01:57,360 --> 00:02:00,720
The spring breeze is
working tirelessly

38
00:02:01,440 --> 00:02:04,519
along the flower beds and willow trees.

39
00:02:05,239 --> 00:02:08,240
Whilst bees make honey
and swallows peck clay,

40
00:02:09,080 --> 00:02:12,240
the rain falls and blows it away.

41
00:02:13,880 --> 00:02:14,800
What's going on?

42
00:02:15,839 --> 00:02:16,960
You didn't expect this, right?

43
00:02:17,039 --> 00:02:18,360
You think you've tricked me,

44
00:02:18,360 --> 00:02:19,720
but I'm a better trickster.

45
00:02:19,720 --> 00:02:20,960
If it wasn't for me,

46
00:02:21,080 --> 00:02:23,000
Prince Tai would've fallen
into your trap.

47
00:02:25,759 --> 00:02:26,800
(Stay calm.)

48
00:02:27,240 --> 00:02:28,039
(Stay calm.)

49
00:02:28,559 --> 00:02:29,880
There's no way Qin Chuan will find out

50
00:02:30,039 --> 00:02:31,919
that I was the one who gave his poems
to Prince Tai.

51
00:02:32,880 --> 00:02:34,320
I will lose my life

52
00:02:34,320 --> 00:02:35,800
if I fail this mission.

53
00:02:36,080 --> 00:02:38,320
I'm sorry you had to deal with this.

54
00:02:38,440 --> 00:02:39,639
What a good poem, Your Majesty.

55
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:42,839
Prince Tai's poetry compared spring
to a man.

56
00:02:42,839 --> 00:02:43,919
It's a very fresh idea

57
00:02:43,919 --> 00:02:44,880
and describes all the details perfectly.

58
00:02:44,880 --> 00:02:46,759
It's a masterpiece.

59
00:02:47,720 --> 00:02:48,679
It's very decent.

60
00:02:50,240 --> 00:02:51,039
Fourth Brother.

61
00:02:51,600 --> 00:02:52,839
What do you think

62
00:02:53,119 --> 00:02:54,320
about my poem?

63
00:02:55,679 --> 00:02:56,440
Your Majesty.

64
00:02:56,440 --> 00:02:58,279
It's an amazing poem
from Second Brother.

65
00:02:58,279 --> 00:03:00,160
I knew there was no way
I could beat him in this.

66
00:03:01,279 --> 00:03:03,199
Fourth Brother has always been
outstanding in poetry.

67
00:03:03,320 --> 00:03:04,160
Why not

68
00:03:04,360 --> 00:03:06,080
let Fourth Brother
recite his poem first?

69
00:03:06,240 --> 00:03:07,039
Chuan.

70
00:03:07,479 --> 00:03:09,080
You'll go first, then.

71
00:03:16,520 --> 00:03:18,000
(It's a pity)

72
00:03:18,399 --> 00:03:20,119
(that I can't take part
in the Poetry Contest.)

73
00:03:20,240 --> 00:03:22,119
(Otherwise, I will make your jaws drop)

74
00:03:22,119 --> 00:03:23,720
(by reciting a random poem.)

75
00:03:25,759 --> 00:03:29,240
The adored moss perhaps.
Clogs leave behind footprints.

76
00:03:29,600 --> 00:03:32,520
Knocks on the wooden gate,
and gets no response.

77
00:03:32,720 --> 00:03:35,479
A garden of spring flowers
can't be contained.

78
00:03:35,839 --> 00:03:39,039
Over the hedge,
an apricot blossom tempts.

79
00:03:47,119 --> 00:03:49,240
The adored moss perhaps.
Clogs leave behind footprints.

80
00:03:49,600 --> 00:03:51,639
Knocks on the wooden gate,
and gets no response.

81
00:03:52,199 --> 00:03:53,960
A garden of spring flowers
can't be contained.

82
00:03:54,080 --> 00:03:56,279
Over the hedge,
an apricot blossom tempts.

83
00:03:57,720 --> 00:03:58,759
What's going on?

84
00:03:59,240 --> 00:04:01,240
Did he actually write
"At the Garden Gate"?

85
00:04:01,919 --> 00:04:03,600
Prince Rui's poem

86
00:04:03,600 --> 00:04:04,880
uses beautiful phrases.

87
00:04:04,880 --> 00:04:06,039
It describes the scenario perfectly.

88
00:04:06,240 --> 00:04:08,279
At the first glance, it is a poem
speaking of a trip to the garden.

89
00:04:08,600 --> 00:04:11,160
But if you listen carefully,
there's a lot of meaning to it.

90
00:04:11,679 --> 00:04:14,080
It is way more artistic
than Prince Tai's poem.

91
00:04:14,080 --> 00:04:15,800
It is brilliant, Your Highness.

92
00:04:16,760 --> 00:04:18,000
I didn't expect

93
00:04:18,480 --> 00:04:20,160
Chuan to be so outstanding

94
00:04:20,160 --> 00:04:22,119
in poetry.

95
00:04:28,640 --> 00:04:29,760
Do I look good?

96
00:04:32,519 --> 00:04:33,920
No one said you looked good.

97
00:04:35,160 --> 00:04:36,200
(This is strange.)

98
00:04:36,519 --> 00:04:38,720
(The Sheng Dynasty is fictitious.)

99
00:04:39,279 --> 00:04:41,119
There aren't Tang, Song, Yuan,
Ming, and Qing Dynasties.

100
00:04:41,279 --> 00:04:42,519
Is Qin Chuan

101
00:04:42,519 --> 00:04:44,399
really that good?

102
00:04:44,399 --> 00:04:46,760
(How could he write a poem exactly
the same as "At The Garden Gate"?)

103
00:04:47,200 --> 00:04:48,279
It's a must

104
00:04:48,279 --> 00:04:49,679
to view the moon in spring.

105
00:04:50,440 --> 00:04:51,640
The theme of the second poem

106
00:04:52,119 --> 00:04:53,959
will be the moon.

107
00:04:53,959 --> 00:04:54,679
Your Majesty,

108
00:04:54,679 --> 00:04:55,880
let me go first.

109
00:04:57,239 --> 00:05:00,079
The moonlight of autumn
is prettier than the one of spring.

110
00:05:01,160 --> 00:05:04,000
The world is vast and silent.

111
00:05:05,040 --> 00:05:07,640
The frost has been heavy
over the past few nights.

112
00:05:08,279 --> 00:05:11,600
And the leaves are slowly withering.

113
00:05:12,440 --> 00:05:14,640
There are ups and downs,

114
00:05:15,320 --> 00:05:16,760
and twists and turns in the poem.

115
00:05:17,040 --> 00:05:18,160
It's a very decent poem.

116
00:05:18,480 --> 00:05:19,440
Yue.

117
00:05:19,440 --> 00:05:21,880
You've made impressive progress.

118
00:05:22,839 --> 00:05:24,320
Thanks for the compliment, Your Majesty.

119
00:05:27,359 --> 00:05:30,119
I saw the moonlight before my couch,

120
00:05:30,679 --> 00:05:33,119
and wondered if it were not the frost
on the ground.

121
00:05:33,480 --> 00:05:35,640
(I raised my head and looked out
on the mountain moon,)

122
00:05:35,959 --> 00:05:38,600
(I bowed my head
and thought of my far-off home.)

123
00:05:39,239 --> 00:05:41,239
There hasn't been a poem

124
00:05:41,239 --> 00:05:42,959
that can surpass this one.

125
00:05:43,720 --> 00:05:45,160
(I'm curious to see)

126
00:05:45,160 --> 00:05:47,000
(what you can come up with this time.)

127
00:05:48,519 --> 00:05:49,320
Chuan.

128
00:05:49,959 --> 00:05:50,839
You shall do it too

129
00:05:50,839 --> 00:05:52,040
this time.

130
00:05:59,480 --> 00:06:00,760
I saw the moonlight before my couch,

131
00:06:00,880 --> 00:06:02,519
and wondered if it were not the frost
on the ground.

132
00:06:02,720 --> 00:06:04,200
I raised my head and looked out
on the mountain moon,

133
00:06:04,440 --> 00:06:06,320
I bowed my head
and thought of my far-off home.

134
00:06:06,640 --> 00:06:08,279
How could he come up with this?

135
00:06:08,480 --> 00:06:11,359
The moonlight reminds the author
of his hometown.

136
00:06:11,559 --> 00:06:13,200
The choice of words is simple
and refreshing,

137
00:06:13,200 --> 00:06:14,760
but at the same time,
also meaningful and sentimental.

138
00:06:15,160 --> 00:06:17,839
Prince Rui is a genius.

139
00:06:18,160 --> 00:06:19,119
This poem

140
00:06:19,119 --> 00:06:20,559
is definitely an extraordinary one.

141
00:06:21,079 --> 00:06:22,720
Write it down
and distribute it across the country.

142
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:24,760
Share it with the scholars.

143
00:06:34,880 --> 00:06:36,440
I do look good.

144
00:06:38,079 --> 00:06:39,480
This makes no sense.

145
00:06:41,079 --> 00:06:42,559
It's not making sense at all.

146
00:06:43,399 --> 00:06:45,119
How could he know this?

147
00:06:45,760 --> 00:06:46,519
This...

148
00:06:46,679 --> 00:06:47,839
The theme of the third poem

149
00:06:48,600 --> 00:06:50,119
will be farewell.

150
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:52,320
Speaking of farewell poetry,

151
00:06:52,559 --> 00:06:54,359
my favorite is “Farewell to Dongda”.

152
00:06:54,839 --> 00:06:57,720
Yellow clouds covering a thousand miles
and the sun setting dim,

153
00:06:58,279 --> 00:07:01,200
(in whirling snow the north wind
drives south the wild geese.)

154
00:07:01,480 --> 00:07:04,000
On the road ahead surely
will be friends dear and true.

155
00:07:04,440 --> 00:07:07,000
Throughout the land
is there anyone who knows not you?

156
00:07:07,880 --> 00:07:09,200
If you're able

157
00:07:09,480 --> 00:07:10,839
to write the exact same poem again,

158
00:07:11,239 --> 00:07:13,200
you can have my head.

159
00:07:22,079 --> 00:07:24,160
Yellow clouds covering a thousand miles
and the sun setting dim,

160
00:07:24,359 --> 00:07:26,440
in whirling snow the north wind
drives south the wild geese.

161
00:07:26,720 --> 00:07:28,320
On the road ahead surely
will be friends dear and true.

162
00:07:28,480 --> 00:07:30,679
Throughout the land is there anyone
who knows not you?

163
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:31,839
Your Majesty.

164
00:07:31,839 --> 00:07:33,160
