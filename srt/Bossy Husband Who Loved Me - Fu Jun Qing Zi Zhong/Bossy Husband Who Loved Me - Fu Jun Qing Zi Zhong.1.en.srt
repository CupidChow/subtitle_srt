(a corruption case was reported
in Jiangzhou.)

the general judge of Jiangzhou,

received a large number of bribes
during his term of service.

10
00:00:38,599 --> 00:00:39,720
Everyone is subject to laws,

11
00:00:40,240 --> 00:00:41,959
and you're no exception.

12

(The good-looking Qin Chuan)

13

(was both a good scholar
and a good fighter,)

14

(but his life)

15
00:01:01,240 --> 00:01:02,959
(was nothing but a tragedy.)

Come out now.

27
00:01:24,080 --> 00:01:24,760
Tell you what.

28
00:01:24,959 --> 00:01:26,639
The man I'm interested in

29
00:01:26,839 --> 00:01:27,919
will never be able to run away from me.

30

(To get what she wanted,)

(so that she could marry Qin Chuan.)

37
00:01:42,919 --> 00:01:45,120
With this decree that orders us
to spend our night together,

38
00:01:45,599 --> 00:01:47,559
you'll have no choice
but to listen to me.

39
00:01:49,480 --> 00:01:50,800
How could you write
an angst fiction like this?

40
00:01:51,319 --> 00:01:53,239
You might get struck and killed
by lightning.

41
00:01:53,239 --> 00:01:54,199
You don't understand.

42
00:01:54,760 --> 00:01:56,319
People love writing unique stories

43
00:01:56,839 --> 00:01:59,040
in recent years.

44
00:02:01,440 --> 00:02:02,279
No way.

45
00:02:02,599 --> 00:02:04,120
Why did the thunder strike
all of a sudden?

46

Hey.

47

(Why...)

50

Young Lady,

51

why did you lift your veil?

52

Who are you?

53
00:02:37,800 --> 00:02:38,679
Where are we?

54
00:02:38,839 --> 00:02:40,039
I'm Xiu'er.

55
00:02:40,399 --> 00:02:41,559
This is your bridal chamber.

56
00:02:41,800 --> 00:02:44,000
It's your wedding day with Prince Rui.

57
00:02:44,360 --> 00:02:45,479
You're going to spend
your wedding night together soon.

58
00:02:45,479 --> 00:02:46,479
My wedding day?

59
00:02:47,160 --> 00:02:47,919
Yes.

60
00:02:51,360 --> 00:02:52,880
I'm in the story!

61
00:02:53,960 --> 00:02:55,360
My goodness.

62
00:02:55,759 --> 00:02:56,880
My goodness.

63
00:02:57,440 --> 00:02:58,600
I've become Mu Xiaoxi,

64
00:02:58,600 --> 00:03:00,240
the lascivious girl I wrote about.

65
00:03:01,240 --> 00:03:02,559
Mu Xiaoxi set a trap

66
00:03:02,839 --> 00:03:04,399
to force the male lead to marry her.

67
00:03:04,600 --> 00:03:05,639
She was very wilful.

68
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:06,440
And

69
00:03:06,559 --> 00:03:08,559
she had a terrible ending.

70
00:03:09,240 --> 00:03:10,679
Why did I become her

71
00:03:10,679 --> 00:03:12,080
out of so many other characters?

72
00:03:16,320 --> 00:03:17,119
Wait.

73
00:03:18,320 --> 00:03:19,800
No.

74
00:03:21,080 --> 00:03:23,160
I'm the author.

75
00:03:23,600 --> 00:03:25,919
I don't have
to follow the original storyline.

76
00:03:28,160 --> 00:03:29,720
I wrote this script,

77
00:03:30,759 --> 00:03:32,839
so it's up to me now.

78
00:03:38,399 --> 00:03:39,199
Your Highness.

79
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:42,039
What's going on in there?

80
00:03:42,440 --> 00:03:42,839
This...

81
00:03:43,240 --> 00:03:44,399
Princess Consort is in the room.

82
00:03:44,399 --> 00:03:46,399
She looks extremely excited.

83
00:03:46,520 --> 00:03:48,000
She also...

84
00:03:48,199 --> 00:03:49,119
She...

85
00:03:51,759 --> 00:03:52,399
She said

86
00:03:52,919 --> 00:03:55,639
that she would definitely sleep
with you tonight.

87
00:03:56,479 --> 00:03:57,000
Your Highness.

88
00:03:57,720 --> 00:03:58,679
It seems like

89
00:03:59,479 --> 00:04:01,520
you can't run away from this tonight.

90
00:04:02,399 --> 00:04:03,919
That's ridiculous.

91
00:04:05,399 --> 00:04:07,880
We have archers and lassoers
hiding in the surroundings.

92
00:04:08,320 --> 00:04:09,600
When Your Highness

93
00:04:09,600 --> 00:04:11,080
cries for help...

94
00:04:11,960 --> 00:04:12,960
Sorry.

95
00:04:13,039 --> 00:04:14,440
Once we get an order from Your Highness,

96
00:04:14,559 --> 00:04:15,919
we'll strike a blow immediately.

97
00:04:16,040 --> 00:04:17,920
I have come up with some rules.

98
00:04:18,320 --> 00:04:19,440
I might give her a chance

99
00:04:19,880 --> 00:04:21,600
if she agrees to follow them.

100
00:04:27,559 --> 00:04:28,399
This is the Knock-out Drug.

101
00:04:28,720 --> 00:04:29,679
Just in case.

102
00:04:32,720 --> 00:04:33,239
That's ridiculous.

103
00:04:33,760 --> 00:04:36,200
There's nothing I haven't seen before.

104
00:04:36,200 --> 00:04:37,679
Why would I be afraid of
a lascivious girl?

105
00:04:48,640 --> 00:04:49,160
All the best!

106
00:04:49,320 --> 00:04:49,799
The drug...

107
00:04:54,559 --> 00:04:55,040
Take care of yourself.

108
00:04:57,239 --> 00:04:58,040
I'll keep this.

109
00:05:02,040 --> 00:05:03,480
A lascivious girl is brutal as a tiger.

110
00:05:19,160 --> 00:05:19,799
Come here.

111
00:05:20,640 --> 00:05:21,440
Take a seat and have some food.

112
00:05:24,920 --> 00:05:26,959
You lifted your own veil
on your wedding night,

113
00:05:26,959 --> 00:05:27,920
and are now here
gobbling down all the food.

114
00:05:28,279 --> 00:05:29,040
I guess you're the only person

115
00:05:29,279 --> 00:05:30,640
in the Capital who would do this.

116
00:05:30,839 --> 00:05:32,040
Sigh.

117
00:05:32,239 --> 00:05:34,160
Anyway, you never want me
as your Princess Consort.

118
00:05:34,279 --> 00:05:36,200
You shouldn't get upset
over trivial matters like this.

119
00:05:37,839 --> 00:05:38,760
By the way,

120
00:05:39,760 --> 00:05:42,359
you can dismiss the archers

121
00:05:42,760 --> 00:05:44,160
and the lassoers out there.

122
00:05:44,600 --> 00:05:45,559
Be careful not to injure anyone.

123
00:05:48,119 --> 00:05:48,959
How did you find out about that?

124
00:05:49,040 --> 00:05:50,320
Not only do I know that,

125
00:05:50,559 --> 00:05:51,600
I also know

126
00:05:51,799 --> 00:05:54,040
that you're hiding the Knock-out Drug
in your pocket.

127
00:05:54,399 --> 00:05:55,359
You can take it out now.

128
00:05:55,679 --> 00:05:56,600
Don't worry.

129
00:05:56,920 --> 00:05:58,760
I have completely no interest in you.

130
00:05:58,760 --> 00:06:00,200
I will never sleep with you.

131
00:06:01,920 --> 00:06:03,160
If you're not interested in me,

132
00:06:03,519 --> 00:06:04,760
why did you ask His Majesty
to issue the decree?

133
00:06:06,320 --> 00:06:07,119
This one?

134
00:06:08,119 --> 00:06:08,920
You can keep it.

135
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:11,320
What are you trying to do?

136
00:06:12,760 --> 00:06:13,880
Boy.

137
00:06:14,040 --> 00:06:15,239
Do you really think you're so handsome

138
00:06:15,239 --> 00:06:16,839
that everyone wants to push you
on the bed?

139
00:06:17,640 --> 00:06:18,480
What a narcissist.

140
00:06:22,079 --> 00:06:23,920
Since we can't change the fact anymore,

141
00:06:24,920 --> 00:06:26,200
let's make a deal.

142
00:06:30,160 --> 00:06:30,720
Number one.

143
00:06:31,799 --> 00:06:32,959
Although we go by husband and wife
publicly,

144
00:06:32,959 --> 00:06:34,720
we'll never be real husband and wife.

145
00:06:34,799 --> 00:06:35,880
Don't ever desire me.

146
00:06:36,200 --> 00:06:37,359
Number two.

147
00:06:38,399 --> 00:06:39,799
I like it quiet.

148
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:43,519
Don't appear before me
unless it's necessary.

149
00:06:43,799 --> 00:06:44,279
Number three...

150
00:06:44,679 --> 00:06:45,559
Number three.

151
00:06:45,559 --> 00:06:47,679
When we are required to stay together,
I need to keep a distance from you.

152
00:06:47,839 --> 00:06:50,079
I should not get into
any physical contact with you, right?

153
00:06:50,399 --> 00:06:51,799
You're so long-winded.

154
00:06:57,559 --> 00:06:58,119
All done.

155
00:06:58,799 --> 00:07:00,720
I've left my fingerprint there.

156
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:02,000
We'll start our sham marriage

157
00:07:02,959 --> 00:07:04,760
starting today.

158
00:07:05,040 --> 00:07:06,119
We'll act like a couple in public,

159
00:07:06,279 --> 00:07:06,839
and carry on

160
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:07,799
with our own lives in private.

161
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:08,959
No one

162
00:07:09,160 --> 00:07:10,239
shall violate the rules.

163
00:07:17,480 --> 00:07:18,559
I'm warning you.

164
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:20,640
Whatever you're up to,

165
00:07:20,799 --> 00:07:21,880
you will never get what you want.

166
00:07:22,119 --> 00:07:23,720
Man. Oh, man.

167
00:07:24,799 --> 00:07:25,920
Although

168
00:07:25,920 --> 00:07:28,279
you're good-looking,

169
00:07:28,640 --> 00:07:30,320
you shouldn't be so full of yourself.

170
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:32,000
Tell you what.

171
00:07:32,839 --> 00:07:35,679
I won't give up all my other chances

172
00:07:36,799 --> 00:07:38,839
just for you.

173
00:07:41,600 --> 00:07:43,399
This is a boring night.

174
00:07:43,799 --> 00:07:44,799
You can enjoy
the wedding night yourself.

175
00:07:54,040 --> 00:07:54,839
Who are you?

176
00:07:55,440 --> 00:07:58,239
I'm the Storyline Manager.

177
00:07:58,799 --> 00:08:02,200
You changed the fate of
the supporting characters arbitrarily.

178
00:08:02,600 --> 00:08:05,760
You're going to get struck and killed
by the lightning.

179
00:08:06,160 --> 00:08:07,279
Please don't.

180
00:08:07,760 --> 00:08:10,000
I'm the author of this book after all.

181
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:11,519
Can't you help me?

182
00:08:11,519 --> 00:08:12,440
Since you're the author,

183
00:08:12,440 --> 00:08:13,399
you have the privilege.

184
00:08:14,119 --> 00:08:15,920
Fine. I'll help you.

185
00:08:16,320 --> 00:08:19,480
There are missions
when you're living in the book.

186
00:08:19,679 --> 00:08:22,040
You need to complete the missions
on time to survive.

187
00:08:22,040 --> 00:08:22,880
Missions?

188
00:08:22,880 --> 00:08:24,040
Your mission now

189
00:08:25,600 --> 00:08:28,239
is to complete the wedding night.

190
00:08:28,480 --> 00:08:31,440
You need to sleep together
in the bridal room for a night.

191
00:08:31,600 --> 00:08:33,400
And we'll consider
the mission a success.

192
00:08:34,280 --> 00:08:35,599
(Spend the night...)

193
00:08:35,599 --> 00:08:36,479
(Otherwise, you'll fail the mission.)

194
00:08:37,200 --> 00:08:38,239
(For every successful mission,)

195
00:08:38,479 --> 00:08:39,960
(you'll earn a Back-to-city Piece.)

196
00:08:40,359 --> 00:08:43,280
You'll return to reality
once you collect 10 pieces of it,

197
00:08:43,960 --> 00:08:47,000
but get struck and killed
by lightning if you fail.

198
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:48,000
You'll get wiped out.

199
00:08:49,080 --> 00:08:49,640
(Huh?)

200
00:08:52,239 --> 00:08:53,039
Then...

201
00:08:59,919 --> 00:09:01,280
Wait.

202
00:09:01,840 --> 00:09:03,000
I have to sleep with him.
