=Episode 2=

2
00:00:19,200 --> 00:00:20,000
Your Highness.

3
00:00:24,799 --> 00:00:26,000
You're still awake.

4
00:00:27,399 --> 00:00:29,079
Rule number two.

5
00:00:29,399 --> 00:00:30,399
Don't appear before me

6
00:00:30,399 --> 00:00:32,000
unless it's necessary.

7
00:00:32,959 --> 00:00:34,880
We're husband and wife.

8
00:00:34,880 --> 00:00:36,400
There's no need to act so awkwardly
around each other.

9
00:00:37,159 --> 00:00:37,880
What else do you want?

10
00:00:38,520 --> 00:00:39,240
Yes.

11
00:00:40,360 --> 00:00:42,080
I thought

12
00:00:42,639 --> 00:00:45,360
the bridal chamber was nicely decorated.

13
00:00:45,400 --> 00:00:47,520
It would be a waste
for you to stay here alone tonight.

14
00:00:48,119 --> 00:00:48,919
Perhaps

15
00:00:49,159 --> 00:00:51,000
I can make do with it

16
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:52,080
and spend a night with you here.

17
00:00:53,840 --> 00:00:55,000
You don't have to do that.

18
00:00:55,319 --> 00:00:57,040
I'm fine by myself.

19
00:00:57,720 --> 00:00:58,799
The door is right there.

20
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:03,759
You're too polite.

21
00:01:03,759 --> 00:01:05,040
You don't have to talk to me
so politely.

22
00:01:05,279 --> 00:01:06,440
We're a married couple.

23
00:01:06,440 --> 00:01:07,800
There's no need to be shy around me.

24
00:01:08,319 --> 00:01:09,279
I will keep you company.

25
00:01:10,559 --> 00:01:11,559
Are you leaving or not?

26
00:01:11,559 --> 00:01:12,360
I'm not leaving.

27
00:01:13,559 --> 00:01:14,519
Are you sure?

28
00:01:15,040 --> 00:01:16,360
I will not leave.

29
00:01:16,879 --> 00:01:17,760
Hey.

30
00:01:17,839 --> 00:01:18,919
What are you doing?

31
00:01:18,919 --> 00:01:19,400
Hey!

32
00:01:19,800 --> 00:01:20,720
Who are you?

33
00:01:20,760 --> 00:01:21,919
I'm warning you.

34
00:01:21,919 --> 00:01:23,040
I'm the Princess Consort.

35
00:01:23,120 --> 00:01:24,599
Put me down now.

36
00:01:24,599 --> 00:01:25,400
Now!

37
00:01:27,319 --> 00:01:28,959
Put me down!

38
00:01:31,800 --> 00:01:32,400
Your Highness,

39
00:01:32,400 --> 00:01:33,160
I'm sorry.

40
00:01:33,639 --> 00:01:34,319
You...

41
00:01:36,639 --> 00:01:38,199
I'm dealing with a slow-witted man.

42
00:01:38,800 --> 00:01:39,959
I guess

43
00:01:40,680 --> 00:01:42,919
I need to come up with a plan.

44
00:02:44,080 --> 00:02:44,919
Mu Xiaoxi?

45
00:02:47,600 --> 00:02:48,679
Will you believe me

46
00:02:48,960 --> 00:02:50,679
if I tell you

47
00:02:50,880 --> 00:02:52,160
that I was sleepwalking?

48
00:02:53,720 --> 00:02:54,600
Hey.

49
00:02:56,320 --> 00:02:57,360
Just let me sleep here for one night.

50
00:02:57,440 --> 00:02:57,960
Please.

51
00:02:57,960 --> 00:02:58,559
Just one night.

52
00:02:58,639 --> 00:02:59,639
What about our deals?

53
00:03:00,320 --> 00:03:01,759
You said you would never spend
your night with me.

54
00:03:03,039 --> 00:03:04,960
Let's postpone our agreement
by one night.

55
00:03:04,960 --> 00:03:05,520
I promise I'll stick to it

56
00:03:05,520 --> 00:03:06,399
tomorrow onward.

57
00:03:08,559 --> 00:03:09,440
Let me go now.

58
00:03:09,800 --> 00:03:10,600
I won't.

59
00:03:12,399 --> 00:03:12,919
Are you really not going to let me go?

60
00:03:12,919 --> 00:03:13,800
I won't.

61
00:03:14,759 --> 00:03:16,199
Please, I'm begging you.

62
00:03:16,199 --> 00:03:17,919
Please put me down.

63
00:03:17,919 --> 00:03:19,600
I won't kill you in the story anymore.

64
00:03:19,600 --> 00:03:20,440
I'll add a few lines for you.

65
00:03:20,960 --> 00:03:22,559
I'll make you the Emperor
in the first chapter.

66
00:03:22,559 --> 00:03:23,919
You'll be a high-ranking official.

67
00:03:24,119 --> 00:03:26,000
I can also make you a wealthy man.

68
00:03:28,440 --> 00:03:29,000
Your Highness,

69
00:03:29,360 --> 00:03:30,479
I'm so sorry.

70
00:03:34,800 --> 00:03:35,399
Qin Chuan.

71
00:03:35,600 --> 00:03:36,080
Open the door now,

72
00:03:36,080 --> 00:03:37,639
or I'll make you pay for it.

73
00:03:50,559 --> 00:03:52,600
It's your wedding night.

74
00:03:52,759 --> 00:03:53,960
How can you throw the bride
out of the room,

75
00:03:54,160 --> 00:03:54,679
right?

76
00:04:09,279 --> 00:04:09,880
Oh.

77
00:04:09,880 --> 00:04:10,600
This is the thing.

78
00:04:11,039 --> 00:04:12,360
I thought this through.

79
00:04:12,520 --> 00:04:14,199
Since you are not interested in me,

80
00:04:14,559 --> 00:04:16,359
there's no need for us to get married.

81
00:04:16,760 --> 00:04:17,440
Therefore,

82
00:04:17,640 --> 00:04:18,880
I have made up my mind.

83
00:04:19,040 --> 00:04:20,079
Let's get a divorce.

84
00:04:22,839 --> 00:04:23,640
A divorce?

85
00:04:31,079 --> 00:04:32,799
You were the one who asked His Majesty
to grant us marriage.

86
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:34,399
And now you're asking for a divorce.

87
00:04:34,760 --> 00:04:36,359
Do you think this is a game?

88
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:38,119
You don't have to worry about this.

89
00:04:38,279 --> 00:04:38,880
You can leave it

90
00:04:38,880 --> 00:04:40,279
to me.

91
00:04:46,440 --> 00:04:47,279
After we finish

92
00:04:47,519 --> 00:04:48,640
these two cups of wine,

93
00:04:48,959 --> 00:04:50,200
we will go

94
00:04:50,640 --> 00:04:52,079
separate ways.

95
00:04:53,839 --> 00:04:54,720
If you think it's smart

96
00:04:54,720 --> 00:04:57,040
to spike my drink,

97
00:04:57,480 --> 00:04:59,079
I suggest you give up now.

98
00:04:59,880 --> 00:05:00,679
Sigh.

99
00:05:00,959 --> 00:05:02,480
Why can't humans

100
00:05:02,760 --> 00:05:05,440
have faith in each other?

101
00:05:05,440 --> 00:05:07,359
Why would I try to drug you?

102
00:05:08,519 --> 00:05:09,320
I'll drink it

103
00:05:10,440 --> 00:05:11,399
if you don't believe me.

104
00:05:19,519 --> 00:05:20,200
Look.

105
00:05:20,600 --> 00:05:21,720
I'm fine.

106
00:05:27,359 --> 00:05:28,359
If that's the case,

107
00:05:29,519 --> 00:05:30,640
you can have this too.

108
00:05:44,920 --> 00:05:46,640
This is the wine of divorce.

109
00:05:46,799 --> 00:05:48,720
Of course, we each need to drink a cup.

110
00:05:49,640 --> 00:05:50,200
Therefore,

111
00:05:50,760 --> 00:05:51,880
you should drink it.

112
00:05:52,640 --> 00:05:53,920
I'm not a good drinker.

113
00:05:54,160 --> 00:05:55,679
What if I get drunk

114
00:05:56,399 --> 00:05:57,600
and do anything inappropriate to you?

115
00:05:57,600 --> 00:05:58,839
Then, we would be done for.

116
00:05:59,239 --> 00:05:59,799
You should drink it.

117
00:06:03,040 --> 00:06:03,839
Wait.

118
00:06:10,839 --> 00:06:12,239
Fine. I'll drink it.
