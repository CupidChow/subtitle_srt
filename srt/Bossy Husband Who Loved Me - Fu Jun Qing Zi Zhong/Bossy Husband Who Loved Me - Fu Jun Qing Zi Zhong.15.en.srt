=Bossy Husband Who Loved Me=
=Episode 15=

2
00:00:09,279 --> 00:00:10,800
You're a very good poet.

3
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:11,720
You will be the role model

4
00:00:11,720 --> 00:00:13,560
for all the royal descendants.

5
00:00:14,399 --> 00:00:15,199
Chuan.

6
00:00:15,960 --> 00:00:17,159
What do you want

7
00:00:17,280 --> 00:00:18,520
as a reward?

8
00:00:18,639 --> 00:00:19,200
I will definitely

9
00:00:19,360 --> 00:00:20,479
fulfill all your requests.

10
00:00:29,239 --> 00:00:29,920
Your Majesty.

11
00:00:30,200 --> 00:00:31,120
I want no reward.

12
00:00:31,280 --> 00:00:32,040
This may sound bold,

13
00:00:32,040 --> 00:00:33,000
but I only have a request.

14
00:00:33,639 --> 00:00:34,439
What is it?

15
00:00:35,119 --> 00:00:36,520
Our country is at war with Beiqing.

16
00:00:36,520 --> 00:00:37,400
Despite the setbacks,

17
00:00:37,400 --> 00:00:38,400
our morale is still high.

18
00:00:38,799 --> 00:00:40,240
It's not a good idea
to make peace with them

19
00:00:40,240 --> 00:00:41,119
by ceding our land
and sending them tributes.

20
00:00:41,200 --> 00:00:42,919
Your Majesty, I hope you can
expel the Beiqing embassy

21
00:00:42,919 --> 00:00:43,759
and put a halt to the negotiation.

22
00:00:46,799 --> 00:00:47,680
We're only talking

23
00:00:47,680 --> 00:00:48,599
about poetry

24
00:00:48,599 --> 00:00:49,520
today.

25
00:00:50,080 --> 00:00:51,119
We're not discussing politics.

26
00:00:51,880 --> 00:00:52,520
Your Majesty.

27
00:00:52,520 --> 00:00:53,959
Although Beiqing appears to be strong,
it's a fragile state.

28
00:00:54,040 --> 00:00:55,560
We will definitely win this battle.

29
00:00:55,560 --> 00:00:56,360
Ceding our land to them

30
00:00:56,360 --> 00:00:58,000
is just like feeding the tiger
with our own flesh.

31
00:00:58,000 --> 00:00:59,080
I said this very clearly.

32
00:00:59,680 --> 00:01:01,200
We would talk about this
some other day.

33
00:01:02,279 --> 00:01:04,319
(Although the storyline has changed,)

34
00:01:04,319 --> 00:01:06,720
Qin Chuan's temperament
is still the same.

35
00:01:06,959 --> 00:01:08,120
He's selfless,

36
00:01:08,120 --> 00:01:09,559
and puts his country
before everything else.

37
00:01:10,519 --> 00:01:12,319
He's truly amazing.

38
00:01:13,120 --> 00:01:13,959
(But...)

39
00:01:14,599 --> 00:01:16,599
(He's going to get me killed too.)

40
00:01:23,199 --> 00:01:24,160
How dare you, Qin Chuan?

41
00:01:24,480 --> 00:01:25,559
How dare you defy His Majesty's decree

42
00:01:25,559 --> 00:01:26,599
and speak to His Majesty with contempt?

43
00:01:27,319 --> 00:01:29,599
Most of the officials second
the peace negotiation.

44
00:01:29,720 --> 00:01:32,120
It's time you sober yourself up
and think about this.

45
00:01:32,760 --> 00:01:33,480
Your Majesty.

46
00:01:33,599 --> 00:01:34,800
Fourth Brother just made
a very blatant statement.

47
00:01:34,919 --> 00:01:35,760
He must be punished.

48
00:01:37,040 --> 00:01:38,120
Leave now.

49
00:01:39,599 --> 00:01:40,120
Your Majesty.

50
00:01:40,199 --> 00:01:41,040
I don't mind leaving,

51
00:01:41,040 --> 00:01:42,400
but the soldiers on the Northern border
must stay.

52
00:01:42,400 --> 00:01:44,000
The people of Sheng must stand firm.

53
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:45,279
Please reconsider this, Your Majesty.

54
00:01:45,400 --> 00:01:46,199
How dare you!

55
00:01:48,919 --> 00:01:49,599
Someone come

56
00:01:50,080 --> 00:01:51,279
and bring him out.

57
00:01:51,519 --> 00:01:52,400
Wait a minute.

58
00:01:54,319 --> 00:01:55,319
Xiaoxi?

59
00:01:56,680 --> 00:01:57,760
Are you going

60
00:01:58,040 --> 00:01:59,559
to intercede

61
00:01:59,559 --> 00:02:00,800
for your husband?

62
00:02:04,599 --> 00:02:05,440
Your Majesty.

63
00:02:05,839 --> 00:02:08,000
Although it's a contest
for the princes,

64
00:02:08,600 --> 00:02:10,559
I have written two poems too.

65
00:02:10,759 --> 00:02:11,399
Can Your Majesty

66
00:02:11,399 --> 00:02:12,520
lend me an ear?

67
00:02:12,960 --> 00:02:13,600
What are you doing?

68
00:02:13,600 --> 00:02:14,080
Go away.

69
00:02:14,080 --> 00:02:14,759
Oh?

70
00:02:14,759 --> 00:02:15,839
You know poetry too, huh?

71
00:02:16,839 --> 00:02:18,039
Read them out.

72
00:02:18,240 --> 00:02:19,279
I'm all ears.

73
00:02:21,279 --> 00:02:24,199
When will there be no more autumn moon
and spring flowers,

74
00:02:24,199 --> 00:02:26,160
for me who had so many memorable hours?

75
00:02:26,800 --> 00:02:29,119
The east wind blew again in my garden
last night.

76
00:02:29,440 --> 00:02:31,360
Reminds me

77
00:02:31,360 --> 00:02:32,520
of the lost moonlit land.

78
00:02:34,240 --> 00:02:35,320
Impressive.

79
00:02:35,800 --> 00:02:36,800
There are merely a few lines,

80
00:02:36,800 --> 00:02:39,080
but it expresses the grief and anger
of the author

81
00:02:39,080 --> 00:02:40,360
so perfectly.

82
00:02:41,839 --> 00:02:43,240
I didn't know

83
00:02:43,679 --> 00:02:46,000
Xiaoxi was this talented.

84
00:02:46,440 --> 00:02:48,119
Through the poem,

85
00:02:48,240 --> 00:02:49,279
I can feel

86
00:02:49,479 --> 00:02:51,399
how much the author missed his homeland.

87
00:02:52,520 --> 00:02:53,639
What brought Xiaoxi

88
00:02:54,360 --> 00:02:55,720
such inspiration?

89
00:02:57,160 --> 00:02:59,240
I read a story before.

90
00:02:59,240 --> 00:03:01,880
There was a country named
the Southern Tang.

91
00:03:02,119 --> 00:03:03,679
Their king loved poetry

92
00:03:03,679 --> 00:03:04,679
and hated wars.

93
00:03:04,759 --> 00:03:06,240
When they were invaded
by a powerful country,

94
00:03:06,240 --> 00:03:08,639
they ceded their lands multiple times
in exchange for peace.

95
00:03:09,279 --> 00:03:10,919
Yet, the enemy said

96
00:03:10,919 --> 00:03:13,279
that he wouldn't allow outsiders
on his land.

97
00:03:13,440 --> 00:03:14,160
Eventually,

98
00:03:14,160 --> 00:03:15,600
the Southern Tang was destroyed.

99
00:03:15,839 --> 00:03:17,000
After the elimination
of the Southern Tang,

100
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:18,199
many officials who surrendered

101
00:03:18,199 --> 00:03:20,199
got to keep their positions
and work for the enemy state.

102
00:03:20,320 --> 00:03:21,279
Yet, the king

103
00:03:21,279 --> 00:03:22,600
was no longer the king.

104
00:03:22,600 --> 00:03:23,759
He became a prisoner.

105
00:03:24,360 --> 00:03:25,520
He missed his homeland,

106
00:03:25,520 --> 00:03:27,199
but he couldn't restore his glory

107
00:03:27,440 --> 00:03:28,520
ever again.

108
00:03:28,520 --> 00:03:30,399
Eventually, he passed away,

109
00:03:31,080 --> 00:03:32,320
dwelling in sorrow and missing his home.

110
00:03:34,520 --> 00:03:36,960
Carved balustrades and marble steps
must still be there,

111
00:03:37,320 --> 00:03:38,360
but

112
00:03:38,360 --> 00:03:39,639
rosy faces will never be as fair.

113
00:03:40,160 --> 00:03:42,119
If you ask me how much
my sorrow has increased,

114
00:03:42,479 --> 00:03:44,440
just look at the over-brimming river

115
00:03:44,575 --> 00:03:46,135
flowing east.

116
00:03:46,160 --> 00:03:46,759
Your Majesty.

117
00:03:46,759 --> 00:03:47,919
She was talking about us.

118
00:03:47,919 --> 00:03:48,520
Your Majesty.

119
00:03:49,279 --> 00:03:50,800
I taught Mu Xiaoxi

120
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:52,199
to say that nonsense.

121
00:03:52,199 --> 00:03:53,160
It has nothing to do with her.

122
00:03:54,279 --> 00:03:55,360
If you ask me

123
00:03:55,960 --> 00:03:57,919
how much my sorrow has increased,

124
00:03:58,839 --> 00:03:59,880
just look at

125
00:04:00,279 --> 00:04:02,240
the over brimming river

126
00:04:02,679 --> 00:04:04,520
flowing east.

127
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:06,119
It's melancholic

128
00:04:06,119 --> 00:04:07,679
and meaningful.

129
00:04:07,679 --> 00:04:10,160
It's as emotional as the surging tide.

130
00:04:10,880 --> 00:04:11,639
This must be the best poem

131
00:04:11,639 --> 00:04:13,440
in history.

132
00:04:13,800 --> 00:04:15,039
This is unprecedented.

133
00:04:15,039 --> 00:04:16,600
Princess Consort should be crowned

134
00:04:16,600 --> 00:04:18,279
as the best poet of the age.

135
00:04:19,279 --> 00:04:20,679
I didn't know

136
00:04:20,880 --> 00:04:21,839
Xiaoxi

137
00:04:21,920 --> 00:04:23,559
was this talented.

138
00:04:23,959 --> 00:04:25,440
The poem

139
00:04:25,839 --> 00:04:26,760
does

140
00:04:26,760 --> 00:04:28,480
sober me up.

141
00:04:29,079 --> 00:04:30,279
Your Majesty is wise.

142
00:04:30,600 --> 00:04:32,480
Of course, you're different

143
00:04:32,480 --> 00:04:33,559
from the ruler of the Southern Tang.

144
00:04:33,920 --> 00:04:35,720
The Sheng has
a well-built military base.

145
00:04:35,720 --> 00:04:37,040
Both our men and horses are strong.

146
00:04:37,320 --> 00:04:39,000
The soldiers are determined
to eliminate their enemies

147
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:40,000
and show their loyalty to Your Majesty.

148
00:04:40,239 --> 00:04:41,320
Their morale is high

149
00:04:41,320 --> 00:04:42,440
and is ready to serve the country.

150
00:04:42,760 --> 00:04:43,839
I have also

151
00:04:43,839 --> 00:04:45,720
made a poem

152
00:04:45,720 --> 00:04:46,959
for the warriors of the Sheng.

153
00:04:47,040 --> 00:04:47,839
Go ahead.

154
00:04:49,160 --> 00:04:50,959
The vast clouds, the blue sea,

155
00:04:50,959 --> 00:04:52,239
the dim snow mountains.

156
00:04:52,679 --> 00:04:54,440
The lone fort faces

157
00:04:54,440 --> 00:04:55,839
the distant Jade-Gate Pass.

158
00:04:56,320 --> 00:04:58,839
Though the armor torn
in constant desert wars,

159
00:04:59,200 --> 00:05:00,679
our men wouldn’t come back

160
00:05:00,679 --> 00:05:02,040
till they beat Beiqing.

161
00:05:02,239 --> 00:05:04,200
The Sheng's soldiers

162
00:05:04,440 --> 00:05:05,920
are all great warriors.

163
00:05:06,119 --> 00:05:07,079
Poems

164
00:05:07,399 --> 00:05:09,359
are not enough to describe

165
00:05:09,359 --> 00:05:10,600
how great the Sheng's troops are.

166
00:05:11,079 --> 00:05:11,920
Your Majesty.

167
00:05:12,320 --> 00:05:13,880
If we fight for peace,

168
00:05:13,880 --> 00:05:14,959
we'll coexist in peace.

169
00:05:15,079 --> 00:05:16,559
If we give in, hoping to seek peace,

170
00:05:16,720 --> 00:05:17,880
we'll die in peace.

171
00:05:17,880 --> 00:05:19,239
The war in the north

172
00:05:19,239 --> 00:05:20,200
will be decided

173
00:05:20,200 --> 00:05:21,239
by merely one word

174
00:05:21,239 --> 00:05:22,239
from Your Majesty.

175
00:05:23,760 --> 00:05:24,880
I hereby

176
00:05:25,359 --> 00:05:26,359
congratulate Your Majesty

177
00:05:26,359 --> 00:05:27,720
on your victory in advance.

178
00:05:36,279 --> 00:05:38,799
We congratulate Your Majesty
on your victory.

179
00:05:42,839 --> 00:05:43,959
You're right.

180
00:05:43,959 --> 00:05:45,920
If we fight for peace,

181
00:05:45,920 --> 00:05:47,320
we'll coexist in peace.

182
00:05:47,720 --> 00:05:49,679
If we give in, hoping to seek peace,

183
00:05:49,679 --> 00:05:50,839
we'll die in peace.

184
00:05:51,079 --> 00:05:52,279
We'll put a halt

185
00:05:52,279 --> 00:05:53,679
on the peace negotiation.

186
00:05:54,480 --> 00:05:55,720
Sheng

187
00:05:55,720 --> 00:05:57,160
and Beiqing

188
00:05:57,359 --> 00:05:59,359
will meet on the battlefield.

189
00:05:59,839 --> 00:06:02,079
Your Majesty is wise.

190
00:06:02,920 --> 00:06:04,119
Please get up.

191
00:06:05,040 --> 00:06:06,720
Thanks, Your Majesty.

192
00:06:10,119 --> 00:06:11,079
Your Majesty.

193
00:06:11,079 --> 00:06:12,519
So who's the winner

194
00:06:12,519 --> 00:06:14,359
for the Poetry Festival?

195
00:06:15,040 --> 00:06:15,959
Our original intention

196
00:06:16,119 --> 00:06:17,959
was to put the princes to the test.

197
00:06:18,320 --> 00:06:20,440
But Xiaoxi, being the Princess Consort,

198
00:06:20,799 --> 00:06:22,040
is part of the family too.

199
00:06:23,440 --> 00:06:24,239
Chuan...

200
00:06:24,959 --> 00:06:26,079
I think

201
00:06:26,160 --> 00:06:27,320
the winner

202
00:06:27,679 --> 00:06:29,239
should be Xiaoxi.

203
00:06:29,239 --> 00:06:29,920
What do you think?

204
00:06:31,720 --> 00:06:32,880
I have no objection.

205
00:06:34,399 --> 00:06:35,359
Thanks, Your Majesty.
