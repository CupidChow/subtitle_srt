What is this?

00:00:17,799 --> 00:00:18,399
'Slanted rice.'
[*WiFi]

4
00:00:18,719 --> 00:00:19,639
The rice is not placed properly.

5
00:00:22,959 --> 00:00:23,719
What about this?

6
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:24,799
This chicken...

7
00:00:24,799 --> 00:00:27,239
Look at its head, beak, and feet.

8
00:00:27,840 --> 00:00:28,959
The chicken's feet

9
00:00:28,959 --> 00:00:30,120
are like a human's hand.

10
00:00:30,440 --> 00:00:31,440
It's a chicken's hand.

11
00:00:31,639 --> 00:00:32,439
'Hand of a chicken.'
[*Handphone]

12
00:00:34,080 --> 00:00:34,919
What is this?

13
00:00:35,240 --> 00:00:36,000
This?

14
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:36,840
'Tall ice.'
[*Ice cream]

15
00:00:37,159 --> 00:00:38,040
Yesterday,

16
00:00:38,040 --> 00:00:39,520
the ice was this tall.

17
00:00:40,040 --> 00:00:41,439
Due to the hot weather,

18
00:00:41,439 --> 00:00:42,200
it melted.

19
00:00:42,720 --> 00:00:43,520
It's not that cold now.

20
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:45,240
Nonsense.

21
00:00:46,680 --> 00:00:47,599
I've

22
00:00:47,599 --> 00:00:48,599
done my best.

23
00:00:54,240 --> 00:00:55,439
We haven't solved these

24
00:00:55,680 --> 00:00:56,560
and new problems have appeared.

25

(Why-fry, Komputer, Ice-Krim,

26
00:01:06,440 --> 00:01:07,879
'Sea dungeon'?
[*Hai Di Lao A hotpot restaurant]

27
00:01:08,519 --> 00:01:10,080
What is that?

28
00:01:10,879 --> 00:01:11,760
'Sea dungeon'.

29
00:01:12,440 --> 00:01:13,559
Based on its name,

30
00:01:13,720 --> 00:01:14,519
it must be

31
00:01:14,519 --> 00:01:17,040
a secret dungeon built near the sea.

32
00:01:20,319 --> 00:01:22,160
I definitely know this 'stomach saliva'.
[*Sanitary napkin]

33
00:01:22,480 --> 00:01:24,400
It's related to the heart, liver,
spleen, stomach, and kidney.

34
00:01:24,839 --> 00:01:26,040
We can ask a doctor.

35
00:01:26,040 --> 00:01:26,919
There should be some hints.

36
00:01:28,239 --> 00:01:29,760
As for this 'bad omen'...
[*Bra]

37
00:01:30,680 --> 00:01:31,919
Use your brain.

38
00:01:32,120 --> 00:01:33,080
To understand the 'bad omen',

39
00:01:33,080 --> 00:01:34,559
we'll have to ask a fortune teller.

40
00:01:35,400 --> 00:01:36,599
You are so wise, Your Highness.

41
00:01:37,760 --> 00:01:38,360
Your Highness!

42
00:01:38,519 --> 00:01:39,199
Your Highness!

43
00:01:41,760 --> 00:01:42,279
Your Highness.

44
00:01:42,480 --> 00:01:43,760
An imperial decree is delivered here.

45
00:01:43,839 --> 00:01:45,040
They are waiting for you
and Princess Consort to return.

46
00:01:49,120 --> 00:01:50,360
Three days later,

47
00:01:50,360 --> 00:01:52,519
I will have a banquet in the palace.

48
00:01:53,040 --> 00:01:56,160
The princes' poetry skills
will be tested.

49
00:01:56,279 --> 00:01:59,720
The winner will be appointed
to an important position.

50
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:01,959
Respect this.

51
00:02:05,559 --> 00:02:06,360
Second Brother.

52
00:02:06,599 --> 00:02:10,039
Father is testing our poetry skills
on the topics of spring and moon.

53
00:02:10,320 --> 00:02:13,399
The winner can meet
the Beiqing ambassadors on his behalf.

54
00:02:13,960 --> 00:02:15,800
This means a lot.

55
00:02:16,360 --> 00:02:17,240
That's right.

56
00:02:18,080 --> 00:02:19,320
Based on our customs,

57
00:02:19,880 --> 00:02:21,240
only the crown prince

58
00:02:21,240 --> 00:02:23,440
can meet foreign ambassadors
on behalf of the Emperor.

59
00:02:24,839 --> 00:02:26,479
Father has always loved poetry.

60
00:02:26,679 --> 00:02:27,639
This test

61
00:02:28,080 --> 00:02:29,800
is probably for him to consider

62
00:02:30,039 --> 00:02:30,919
the candidate of the crown prince.

63
00:02:31,320 --> 00:02:33,360
Our eldest brother is always weak,

64
00:02:33,600 --> 00:02:34,720
so he can't be the Emperor.

65
00:02:35,320 --> 00:02:37,039
Second Brother, you are
the most suitable person.

66
00:02:37,839 --> 00:02:39,679
However, Fourth Brother
has just solved the corruption case,

67
00:02:39,679 --> 00:02:40,800
so he's got the limelight.

68
00:02:41,080 --> 00:02:42,800
Fifth Brother was grounded and
his title was abolished because of him.

69
00:02:43,399 --> 00:02:46,000
It's not easy to win.

70
00:02:47,720 --> 00:02:49,559
I'm also worried about this matter.

71
00:02:51,199 --> 00:02:51,800
Third Brother,

72
00:02:52,320 --> 00:02:53,399
you're smart and resourceful.

73
00:02:53,800 --> 00:02:55,080
Do you have any good ideas?

74
00:02:55,759 --> 00:02:57,320
I've always been supporting you.

75
00:02:57,679 --> 00:02:59,119
I'll definitely help you
solve your problems.

76
00:02:59,679 --> 00:03:00,839
I have a spy

77
00:03:00,839 --> 00:03:02,600
who ambushes
in Fourth Brother's residence.

78
00:03:03,880 --> 00:03:05,479
As long as you...

79
00:03:09,919 --> 00:03:10,720
All right.

80
00:03:10,880 --> 00:03:11,679
Good idea.

81
00:03:12,080 --> 00:03:13,080
Let's do this.

82
00:03:13,440 --> 00:03:14,080
All right.

83
00:03:14,639 --> 00:03:17,240
The third mission is activated.

84
00:03:18,039 --> 00:03:19,279
The aim of the mission

85
00:03:19,279 --> 00:03:21,320
is to stop Qin Chuan
from getting first place.

86
00:03:21,600 --> 00:03:22,759
Here's the description of the mission.

87
00:03:22,759 --> 00:03:24,199
In the Poetry Festival,

88
00:03:24,199 --> 00:03:26,960
if Qin Chuan is not the winner

89
00:03:26,960 --> 00:03:28,119
announced by the Emperor,

90
00:03:28,399 --> 00:03:30,160
the mission is accomplished.

91
00:03:30,160 --> 00:03:31,119
Otherwise,

92
00:03:31,119 --> 00:03:32,559
it is considered failing the mission.

93
00:03:33,839 --> 00:03:35,199
In the original plot,

94
00:03:35,199 --> 00:03:37,600
the draft of the good poem
that Qin Chuan wrote painstakingly

95
00:03:37,679 --> 00:03:39,800
was stolen by Ding.

96
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:41,800
Therefore, in the Poetry Festival,

97
00:03:41,800 --> 00:03:44,759
the Second Prince used
Qin Chuan's poem and read it,

98
00:03:44,759 --> 00:03:46,679
causing Qin Chuan
to have nothing to present.

99
00:03:46,679 --> 00:03:47,440
At last,

100
00:03:47,440 --> 00:03:49,800
Second Prince got first place
in the Poetry Festival.

101
00:03:50,199 --> 00:03:51,919
This mission

102
00:03:51,919 --> 00:03:52,919
is easy.

103
00:03:52,919 --> 00:03:53,880
How simple.

104
00:03:54,039 --> 00:03:56,800
It's good to be optimistic.

105
00:03:57,199 --> 00:03:59,639
If you don't accomplish
the mission this time,

106
00:04:00,199 --> 00:04:00,960
beware of

107
00:04:00,960 --> 00:04:02,800
disappearing into ashes.

108
00:04:03,080 --> 00:04:04,119
Good luck.

109
00:04:05,320 --> 00:04:07,039
Ding?

110
00:04:13,399 --> 00:04:14,199
Ding!

111
00:04:15,600 --> 00:04:16,399
Your Highness.

112
00:04:18,760 --> 00:04:19,799
You're Ding.

113
00:04:20,640 --> 00:04:21,359
Your Highness.

114
00:04:21,799 --> 00:04:23,160
You could recognize me, couldn't you?

115
00:04:24,040 --> 00:04:24,559
Yes.

116
00:04:25,119 --> 00:04:26,320
I just want to confirm.

117
00:04:28,119 --> 00:04:29,079
What are you

118
00:04:29,079 --> 00:04:29,760
doing?

119
00:04:30,519 --> 00:04:32,359
These are freshly cut watermelons.

120
00:04:32,359 --> 00:04:33,480
I was about to send them to you.

121
00:04:34,880 --> 00:04:36,720
How can I let you do this?

122
00:04:36,839 --> 00:04:38,000
I can help myself.

123
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:38,640
Your Highness.

124
00:04:38,640 --> 00:04:40,640
Did I do anything wrong?

125
00:04:40,640 --> 00:04:41,959
How can you be the one doing this?

126
00:04:41,959 --> 00:04:43,320
You really did something wrong.

127
00:04:43,320 --> 00:04:45,040
You made a big mistake.

128
00:04:45,119 --> 00:04:45,959
Your Highness.

129
00:04:45,959 --> 00:04:48,040
I really don't know what I did wrong.

130
00:04:49,399 --> 00:04:50,839
Taking care of the prince

131
00:04:50,839 --> 00:04:52,720
is your most important mission.

132
00:04:52,839 --> 00:04:54,640
Don't care about anything else.

133
00:04:54,880 --> 00:04:55,880
However, His Highness

134
00:04:55,880 --> 00:04:57,440
told me to take care of
Your Highness too.

135
00:04:57,839 --> 00:05:00,160
Princess Consort's matters
are small matters.

136
00:05:00,320 --> 00:05:01,519
The prince's matters

137
00:05:01,720 --> 00:05:02,959
are important.

138
00:05:03,399 --> 00:05:04,079
Recently,

139
00:05:04,079 --> 00:05:06,359
the prince is working hard
for the Poetry Festival.

140
00:05:06,600 --> 00:05:08,559
I couldn't sleep well
because I'm worried about him.

141
00:05:08,720 --> 00:05:09,640
At this moment,

142
00:05:09,640 --> 00:05:10,920
you should stay by his side

143
00:05:10,920 --> 00:05:12,359
and take good care of him.

144
00:05:12,359 --> 00:05:12,760
Do you understand?

145
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:14,839
Your Highness, it's so touching
to see you caring for His Highness.

146
00:05:15,559 --> 00:05:16,920
I will remember your instruction.

147
00:05:17,760 --> 00:05:18,640
So,

148
00:05:18,640 --> 00:05:19,679
why are you still here?

149
00:05:19,679 --> 00:05:20,839
Go now!

150
00:05:20,839 --> 00:05:22,040
Yes.

151
00:05:28,119 --> 00:05:29,920
I'm counting on you.

152
00:05:36,559 --> 00:05:37,239
Your Highness.

153
00:05:38,760 --> 00:05:39,559
Ding?

154
00:05:40,119 --> 00:05:41,320
Why are you here?

155
00:05:41,440 --> 00:05:43,000
I'm directing them to do the cleaning.

156
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:44,880
Taking care of the prince
is your most important mission.

157
00:05:45,679 --> 00:05:46,679
Taking care of the prince?

158
00:05:47,760 --> 00:05:49,200
Give him personal care.

159
00:05:49,440 --> 00:05:50,320
Do you understand?

160
00:05:51,760 --> 00:05:52,640
Yes, Your Highness.

161
00:05:53,679 --> 00:05:54,399
Go now.

162
00:05:54,399 --> 00:05:55,200
Yes.

163
00:06:01,320 --> 00:06:02,200
Am I exposed?

164
00:06:03,920 --> 00:06:05,559
I shall send a message
and report to Prince Kang.

165
00:06:13,399 --> 00:06:14,200
Ding!

166
00:06:15,359 --> 00:06:16,320
What are you doing?

167
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:20,000
What is that pigeon for?
