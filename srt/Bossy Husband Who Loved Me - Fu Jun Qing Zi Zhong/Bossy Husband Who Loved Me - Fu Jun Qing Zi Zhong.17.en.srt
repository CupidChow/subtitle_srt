2
00:00:13,159 --> 00:00:14,439
Something's wrong.

3
00:00:15,399 --> 00:00:17,000
In my novel,

4
00:00:17,079 --> 00:00:18,799
Qin Chuan is supposed to be
a very unlucky guy.

5
00:00:19,680 --> 00:00:20,879
Look at what happened.

6
00:00:21,159 --> 00:00:22,479
He didn't lose his ledger.

7
00:00:23,040 --> 00:00:24,319
They failed to shift the blame on him.

8
00:00:24,559 --> 00:00:26,719
He even won the Poetry Contest.

9
00:00:28,239 --> 00:00:30,840
Everything has been going really well
for him.

10
00:00:31,079 --> 00:00:32,639
And I've become the unlucky one.

11
00:00:34,080 --> 00:00:35,680
Did it happen

12
00:00:36,560 --> 00:00:38,360
because I got too close to him?

13
00:00:39,080 --> 00:00:40,560
Did he transfer his bad luck to me?

14
00:00:41,919 --> 00:00:42,680
I can't let this happen.

15
00:00:42,680 --> 00:00:43,840
I need to do some calculations.

16
00:00:58,720 --> 00:01:01,000
He can actually transfer
his bad luck to me.

17
00:01:02,880 --> 00:01:04,040
It seems like

18
00:01:04,040 --> 00:01:05,800
I need to keep a distance from him
from now on.

19
00:01:07,559 --> 00:01:08,360
Let me have a look.

20
00:01:12,760 --> 00:01:13,720
What is this?

21
00:01:16,160 --> 00:01:17,080
The constellation map.

22
00:01:20,239 --> 00:01:21,360
What is a constellation map?

23
00:01:22,919 --> 00:01:24,279
Let me explain it

24
00:01:24,279 --> 00:01:25,760
in your language.

25
00:01:25,760 --> 00:01:26,639
This is what you use

26
00:01:26,639 --> 00:01:28,319
to check one's fortune.

27
00:01:30,440 --> 00:01:31,400
So what's the result?

28
00:01:32,120 --> 00:01:33,040
I have extremely bad luck.

29
00:01:33,040 --> 00:01:33,959
It's the Mercury retrograde.

30
00:01:36,239 --> 00:01:37,040
Don't worry.

31
00:01:37,720 --> 00:01:39,160
Since you're married to Prince Rui,

32
00:01:39,519 --> 00:01:40,319
you only need to say a word

33
00:01:40,319 --> 00:01:41,919
and I'll stop anyone from hurting you.

34
00:01:42,680 --> 00:01:43,559
If you're facing

35
00:01:43,559 --> 00:01:44,680
any troubles

36
00:01:44,680 --> 00:01:45,440
or difficulties,

37
00:01:45,559 --> 00:01:46,800
you can always talk to me.

38
00:01:48,239 --> 00:01:49,040
Huh?

39
00:01:49,120 --> 00:01:49,919
Don't worry.

40
00:01:50,319 --> 00:01:52,680
I'm a man of my word.

41
00:01:52,680 --> 00:01:53,680
You don't have to worry about anything.

42
00:01:55,040 --> 00:01:55,680
What are you

43
00:01:55,680 --> 00:01:56,959
talking about?

44
00:01:58,839 --> 00:01:59,839
I mean...

45
00:02:00,199 --> 00:02:01,199
After hearing

46
00:02:01,319 --> 00:02:02,800
my words,

47
00:02:03,040 --> 00:02:04,480
don't you have anything to say to me?

48
00:02:04,480 --> 00:02:05,239
Do you have anything

49
00:02:05,559 --> 00:02:06,760
on your mind?

50
00:02:07,760 --> 00:02:08,600
Yes.

51
00:02:09,399 --> 00:02:10,600
I think

52
00:02:11,440 --> 00:02:12,720
I need to stay away from you.

53
00:02:14,119 --> 00:02:14,759
Yes.

54
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:15,800
Stay away from you.

55
00:02:16,279 --> 00:02:16,960
Further.

56
00:02:18,600 --> 00:02:19,600
The further, the better.

57
00:02:28,720 --> 00:02:29,360
Your Highness.

58
00:02:30,199 --> 00:02:31,000
How did it go?

59
00:02:35,039 --> 00:02:36,440
It seems like
I can't read her mind anymore.

60
00:02:40,679 --> 00:02:41,720
From our wedding night

61
00:02:41,720 --> 00:02:43,240
to the first time I failed to
read her mind,

62
00:02:43,440 --> 00:02:44,479
it took seven days.

63
00:02:45,199 --> 00:02:46,559
I regained the ability
when I was at the Mu's Residence.

64
00:02:46,559 --> 00:02:48,039
And it has been seven days since then.

65
00:02:49,559 --> 00:02:51,399
It seems like my ability
to read her mind

66
00:02:51,520 --> 00:02:52,440
only lasts

67
00:02:52,759 --> 00:02:53,759
for seven days.

68
00:02:56,320 --> 00:02:58,399
I'm sure

69
00:02:58,399 --> 00:02:59,679
Her Highness was extremely moved

70
00:02:59,679 --> 00:03:01,080
by Your Highness' words.

71
00:03:01,360 --> 00:03:02,639
Although she didn't say it out loud,

72
00:03:02,839 --> 00:03:03,720
I'm sure

73
00:03:03,720 --> 00:03:04,679
she can't stop thinking about it.

74
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:06,639
Your Highness,

75
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:08,559
you need to kiss Her Highness again.

76
00:03:08,960 --> 00:03:10,240
You need to read her mind again,

77
00:03:10,360 --> 00:03:11,800
and you'll be able to find out

78
00:03:11,800 --> 00:03:13,240
who "Yuan Ju Qing" actually is.

79
00:03:14,320 --> 00:03:16,000
I sneaked a kiss on her
while she was asleep previously,

80
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:17,720
and I almost got caught.

81
00:03:18,039 --> 00:03:18,800
It's not going to be as easy

82
00:03:20,639 --> 00:03:21,679
this time.

83
00:03:23,360 --> 00:03:23,880
I have

84
00:03:24,399 --> 00:03:25,839
an idea.

85
00:03:30,479 --> 00:03:31,440
Thanks for helping me

86
00:03:31,639 --> 00:03:33,360
when we were at the palace that day.

87
00:03:33,919 --> 00:03:35,479
I've always wanted to thank you.

88
00:03:38,160 --> 00:03:38,600
Here.

89
00:03:39,039 --> 00:03:40,119
Let me propose a toast for you.

90
00:03:49,119 --> 00:03:51,240
Why did this guy change his attitude
all of a sudden?

91
00:03:51,520 --> 00:03:53,039
He must have an agenda.

92
00:03:53,279 --> 00:03:54,720
I need to be careful.

93
00:03:58,479 --> 00:03:59,960
What Xi did that day

94
00:03:59,960 --> 00:04:00,880
was

95
00:04:00,880 --> 00:04:02,039
very impressive.

96
00:04:02,479 --> 00:04:04,080
Especially the line.

97
00:04:04,080 --> 00:04:05,639
Just see the over-brimming river

98
00:04:05,639 --> 00:04:06,720
flowing east.

99
00:04:08,440 --> 00:04:09,880
It's the best line I've ever heard.

100
00:04:10,199 --> 00:04:10,880
You wrote

101
00:04:10,880 --> 00:04:12,160
very good poems

102
00:04:12,160 --> 00:04:13,559
too.

103
00:04:13,559 --> 00:04:15,000
They're wonderful.

104
00:04:15,559 --> 00:04:16,399
How did you manage

105
00:04:17,320 --> 00:04:18,480
to come up with those?

106
00:04:18,640 --> 00:04:19,480
It was

107
00:04:19,480 --> 00:04:21,119
just a coincidence.

108
00:04:21,920 --> 00:04:22,720
It's not worth mentioning.

109
00:04:24,880 --> 00:04:25,640

110

(Why does he keep pouring me drinks?)

115
00:04:35,839 --> 00:04:37,079
Is he trying to get me drunk

116
00:04:37,079 --> 00:04:39,399
and get some information out of me?

117
00:04:40,399 --> 00:04:40,880
Xi.

118
00:04:53,880 --> 00:04:54,679
The wine tastes really good.

119
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:56,119
It's really good.

120
00:04:57,959 --> 00:04:59,399
Other than poetry,

121
00:04:59,720 --> 00:05:00,440
Xi gave

122
00:05:00,440 --> 00:05:01,720
constructible advice

123
00:05:01,880 --> 00:05:03,720
to His Majesty as well.

124
00:05:04,359 --> 00:05:05,480
Your words were thought-provoking.

125
00:05:06,359 --> 00:05:07,399
At that time,

126
00:05:07,440 --> 00:05:08,640
I even thought

127
00:05:08,640 --> 00:05:10,079
that we were of the same mind.

128
00:05:12,399 --> 00:05:12,959
Here.

129
00:05:13,760 --> 00:05:14,640
Let's drink.

130
00:05:30,679 --> 00:05:31,399
I...

131
00:05:31,519 --> 00:05:32,679
Why do I

132
00:05:32,679 --> 00:05:33,959
feel so dizzy?

133
00:05:34,880 --> 00:05:36,119
No.

134
00:05:36,200 --> 00:05:38,079
I'm a bad drinker.

135
00:05:38,279 --> 00:05:39,600
I can't drink anymore.

136
00:05:40,279 --> 00:05:41,320
Xi, you're too humble.

137
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:42,920
You were capable

138
00:05:42,920 --> 00:05:44,040
of writing

139
00:05:44,040 --> 00:05:45,760
a great line like,

140
00:05:45,760 --> 00:05:48,040
"Our men wouldn't come back
till they beat Beiqing."

141
00:05:48,559 --> 00:05:50,119
I'm sure you're a good drinker too.

142
00:05:52,480 --> 00:05:53,279
However,

143
00:05:54,079 --> 00:05:55,920
I have a question for you.

144
00:05:58,519 --> 00:05:59,399
Fire away.

145
00:06:00,079 --> 00:06:00,720
Fire away.

146
00:06:05,440 --> 00:06:06,880
I wonder

147
00:06:07,079 --> 00:06:09,000
if there's a person

148
00:06:09,200 --> 00:06:10,640
you really want to get rid of,

149
00:06:10,920 --> 00:06:11,799
but also

150
00:06:12,440 --> 00:06:13,880
find it impossible to do so.

151
00:06:14,559 --> 00:06:15,399
Sometimes,

152
00:06:15,799 --> 00:06:17,720
he even blackmails you.

153
00:06:18,640 --> 00:06:19,359
Is there a person like that?

154
00:06:24,799 --> 00:06:25,640
Don't worry, Xi.

155
00:06:25,959 --> 00:06:27,320
We're alone here.

156
00:06:27,320 --> 00:06:28,760
You can tell me everything.

157
00:06:32,720 --> 00:06:33,519
Oh.

158
00:06:34,519 --> 00:06:35,640

159
