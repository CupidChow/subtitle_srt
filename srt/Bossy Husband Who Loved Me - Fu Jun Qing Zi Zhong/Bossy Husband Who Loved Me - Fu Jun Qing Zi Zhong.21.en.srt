=Bossy Husband Who Loved Me=
=Episode 21=

2
00:00:08,720 --> 00:00:10,199
What have I done?

3
00:00:10,359 --> 00:00:12,279
Why did Your Highness
push me into the pond?

4
00:00:12,920 --> 00:00:13,439
Hmm...

5
00:00:13,439 --> 00:00:14,079
Your Highness.

6
00:00:14,159 --> 00:00:15,720
Hurry up and help Miss Liu up.

7
00:00:15,720 --> 00:00:17,680
Bring her to the room
and check her pulse.

8
00:00:17,879 --> 00:00:18,680
Hurry up.

9
00:00:18,879 --> 00:00:20,000
I'll cook you soup.

10
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:20,719
I'll be right back.

11
00:00:20,719 --> 00:00:21,239
Your Highness.

12
00:00:24,399 --> 00:00:25,520
According to the original storyline,

13
00:00:25,520 --> 00:00:27,559
Shangguan Ruyu was supposed
to approach me

14
00:00:27,920 --> 00:00:29,479
and pretend
that I pushed her into the pond.

15
00:00:29,479 --> 00:00:31,399
Then, she would ask Qin Chuan
to take care of her.

16
00:00:32,040 --> 00:00:33,040
Although

17
00:00:33,040 --> 00:00:33,720
we haven't reached that part

18
00:00:33,720 --> 00:00:35,759
where I catch them in bed,

19
00:00:36,319 --> 00:00:38,040
I don't have to follow
the original storyline.

20
00:00:38,159 --> 00:00:40,000
My mission is to catch them
in the same bed.

21
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:40,560
I only need to

22
00:00:40,720 --> 00:00:42,159
put them

23
00:00:42,159 --> 00:00:43,279
in the same room.

24
00:00:43,279 --> 00:00:44,560
Then, I'll rush into the room

25
00:00:44,560 --> 00:00:45,240
and accuse them

26
00:00:45,240 --> 00:00:46,880
of committing adultery.

27
00:00:48,680 --> 00:00:49,919
I'm so smart.

28
00:00:50,200 --> 00:00:51,319
Of course, I am smart.

29
00:00:55,479 --> 00:00:56,599
The two of you...

30
00:01:00,479 --> 00:01:02,000
Why are you alone?

31
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:02,799
Where is Qin Chuan?

32
00:01:03,119 --> 00:01:04,040
His Highness

33
00:01:05,319 --> 00:01:06,440
is out there.

34
00:01:06,879 --> 00:01:08,279
Out there?

35
00:01:32,199 --> 00:01:33,120
What

36
00:01:33,120 --> 00:01:34,040
are you doing?

37
00:01:34,279 --> 00:01:35,519
Can't you see it?

38
00:01:35,639 --> 00:01:36,800
I'm taking her pulse with a string.

39
00:01:37,879 --> 00:01:41,040
But isn't the string a little too long?

40
00:01:41,239 --> 00:01:42,760
Can you actually hear her pulse?

41
00:01:42,839 --> 00:01:43,879
Why not?

42
00:01:45,080 --> 00:01:45,959
Besides,

43
00:01:46,199 --> 00:01:48,239
Miss Liu and I are of opposite genders.

44
00:01:48,360 --> 00:01:49,360
There might be some misunderstandings

45
00:01:49,360 --> 00:01:50,760
if we stay in the same room alone.

46
00:01:51,199 --> 00:01:53,000
We should keep a distance
from each other.

47
00:01:54,080 --> 00:01:54,959
Aren't you bringing soup for her?

48
00:01:54,959 --> 00:01:55,559
Hurry up.

49
00:01:55,919 --> 00:01:57,160
You should deliver it
while it's still warm.

50
00:01:57,879 --> 00:01:59,360
I'll get going now.

51
00:02:10,919 --> 00:02:12,160
How cunning.

52
00:02:12,520 --> 00:02:14,199
He wasn't usually this polite.

53
00:02:14,199 --> 00:02:16,559
And now he's teaching me about manners.

54
00:02:17,119 --> 00:02:17,839
No.

55
00:02:17,839 --> 00:02:18,839
If this continues,

56
00:02:18,839 --> 00:02:20,000
I won't be able to complete my mission.

57
00:02:20,559 --> 00:02:22,039
It's time I show him the real deal.

58
00:02:31,160 --> 00:02:32,759
Your Highness, you're being too kind.

59
00:02:33,080 --> 00:02:33,679
I don't mind

60
00:02:33,679 --> 00:02:35,279
sleeping in the guest room.

61
00:02:35,440 --> 00:02:36,960
You can't sleep there.

62
00:02:38,080 --> 00:02:39,479
We are

63
00:02:39,479 --> 00:02:40,440
best friends.

64
00:02:40,440 --> 00:02:42,000
We are sisters.

65
00:02:42,559 --> 00:02:43,880
Of course, we need to share a room.

66
00:02:43,960 --> 00:02:44,600
Let's go.

67
00:02:50,520 --> 00:02:52,119
If I let you sleep in another room,

68
00:02:54,320 --> 00:02:55,479
how am I going

69
00:02:55,759 --> 00:02:56,759
to carry out my plan?

70
00:03:16,160 --> 00:03:16,880
Your Highness.

71
00:03:16,880 --> 00:03:18,160
Her Highness said
she wasn't feeling well.

72
00:03:18,160 --> 00:03:19,360
Can Your Highness check on her?

73
00:03:24,880 --> 00:03:25,679
Xi.

74
00:03:28,919 --> 00:03:29,720
Where is she?

75
00:03:29,839 --> 00:03:30,759
Qin Chuan...

76
00:03:30,759 --> 00:03:32,000
How dare you!

77
00:03:38,080 --> 00:03:38,880
Where is she?

78
00:03:47,600 --> 00:03:48,880
Where is he?

79
00:03:56,600 --> 00:03:57,559
Please don't be mad, Your Highness.

80
00:03:58,600 --> 00:04:00,320
The spy misinformed us.

81
00:04:00,600 --> 00:04:01,440
Unlike what the rumor says,

82
00:04:01,440 --> 00:04:03,839
Qin Chuan and Mu Xiaoxi
aren't on bad terms.

83
00:04:04,399 --> 00:04:06,119
However, Qin Chuan is a very good liar,

84
00:04:06,600 --> 00:04:08,039
and Mu Xiaoxi

85
00:04:08,360 --> 00:04:09,600
is a cunning woman.

86
00:04:10,119 --> 00:04:11,720
I underestimated her.

87
00:04:12,039 --> 00:04:14,679
She kept me by her side
yesterday night,

88
00:04:15,199 --> 00:04:17,440
but knew that I was going
to sneak into Qin Chuan's room.

89
00:04:17,480 --> 00:04:18,440
She managed to get one step ahead of me

90
00:04:18,440 --> 00:04:20,320
and bring Qin Chuan to her room.

91
00:04:20,320 --> 00:04:22,160
Because of her,
my effort went down the drain.

92
00:04:22,559 --> 00:04:24,600
I even had to come up with
an explanation and apologize for it.

93
00:04:26,480 --> 00:04:27,279
None of them

94
00:04:27,279 --> 00:04:29,079
is easy to deal with.

95
00:04:29,679 --> 00:04:30,519
Your Highness.

96
00:04:30,760 --> 00:04:32,160
So what should we do next?

97
00:04:32,760 --> 00:04:35,079
We won't gain anything
by doing the usual tricks.

98
00:04:36,200 --> 00:04:38,640
I won't spare you any mercy again.

99
00:04:39,640 --> 00:04:40,320
Your Highness.

100
00:04:41,040 --> 00:04:42,399
Someone sent you a note.

101
00:04:47,500 --> 00:04:50,800
(It's about Her Highness.
Let's meet up.)

102
00:04:54,559 --> 00:04:56,519
They can't stay still any longer.

103
00:05:00,519 --> 00:05:01,640
I'm done for.

104
00:05:01,799 --> 00:05:03,200
I'm going to fail my mission.

105
00:05:03,279 --> 00:05:05,239
What a lousy teammate.

106
00:05:05,480 --> 00:05:06,119
Qin Chuan

107
00:05:06,119 --> 00:05:08,160
suddenly decided to be a gentleman,

108
00:05:08,399 --> 00:05:10,040
but I lured him into the room.

109
00:05:10,040 --> 00:05:12,279
Shangguan Ruyu,
why did you leave the room?

110
00:05:14,320 --> 00:05:15,239
This time,

111
00:05:15,239 --> 00:05:17,119
I'm going to die young.

112
00:05:26,760 --> 00:05:27,559
Young Lady.

113
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:30,799
I found a note by the door.

114
00:05:33,480 --> 00:05:35,480
(Shuixie Pavilion. Qin Chuan
and Liu meeting up in private)

115
00:05:35,480 --> 00:05:36,160
My goodness.

116
00:05:36,359 --> 00:05:37,679
I didn't see a plot twist here.

117
00:05:38,239 --> 00:05:39,200
Good job.

118
00:05:39,200 --> 00:05:41,160
You didn't disappoint me.

119
00:05:42,839 --> 00:05:44,200
Young Lady, where are you going?

120
00:05:45,640 --> 00:05:46,559
To catch the adulterers.

121
00:05:48,720 --> 00:05:49,799
The adulterers?

122
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:57,440
Miss Liu, you said

123
00:05:57,720 --> 00:05:59,320
that you have something to tell me,

124
00:05:59,679 --> 00:06:00,720
and it's about Princess Consort.

125
00:06:01,480 --> 00:06:02,640
Can we cut to the chase?

126
00:06:03,760 --> 00:06:05,160
Why the hurry, Your Highness?

127
00:06:05,440 --> 00:06:06,559
You just arrived.

128
00:06:06,559 --> 00:06:09,320
I made this tea for you. Try it.

129
00:06:24,440 --> 00:06:25,480
I've drunk the tea.

130
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:27,320
Can you tell me what is it about now?

131
00:06:28,600 --> 00:06:29,880
Rumors say

132
00:06:29,880 --> 00:06:31,839
that Your Highnesses
have gone cold on each other.

133
00:06:32,640 --> 00:06:34,720
Little did I know

134
00:06:34,720 --> 00:06:36,399
Your Highness
cared for Her Highness a lot.

135
00:06:36,799 --> 00:06:38,559
I'm very envious.

136
00:06:39,200 --> 00:06:40,640
I didn't expect

137
00:06:40,880 --> 00:06:43,040
that Miss Liu, who looks
just like any other delicate woman,

138
00:06:43,679 --> 00:06:45,279
actually has a different identity.

139
00:06:46,480 --> 00:06:47,920
Should I call you

140
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:50,239
Shangguan Ruyu?

141
00:06:54,399 --> 00:06:57,119
You definitely are
the famous Prince Rui.

142
00:06:57,959 --> 00:06:59,679
I underestimated you.

143
00:07:00,679 --> 00:07:02,720
Since you have found out
my real identity,

144
00:07:03,119 --> 00:07:04,760
why did you still bother
to meet me here?

145
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:09,359
Miss Liu, stop playing the fool.

146
00:07:09,880 --> 00:07:11,519
I come here only for one thing.

147
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:13,040
Who is

148
00:07:13,920 --> 00:07:15,079
"Yuan Ju Qing"?
