5
00:00:19,400 --> 00:00:20,260
Ramil.

6
00:00:24,100 --> 00:00:25,480
Thank you, Mr. Punn.

7
00:00:27,480 --> 00:00:30,420
Thank you for setting my master free.

8
00:00:30,810 --> 00:00:34,150
Master Ramil must regain all his powers

9
00:00:34,180 --> 00:00:37,280
so we can appoint him as our leader again.

10
00:00:38,570 --> 00:00:40,080
Aaaah!

11
00:00:40,110 --> 00:00:43,540
You said Mr. Ramil and I share a bond. What does that mean?

12
00:00:48,040 --> 00:00:51,770
When the time is right, you will understand.

13
00:00:52,740 --> 00:00:53,490
Punn.

14
00:00:53,490 --> 00:00:57,680
A HUNDRED YEARS AGO

15
00:00:59,900 --> 00:01:02,720
I offer the blood of a widow as a sacrifice

16
00:01:09,460 --> 00:01:12,160
to summon the Mother of Demons.

17
00:01:12,750 --> 00:01:15,200
Hear my plea

18
00:01:23,490 --> 00:01:29,300
and bestow the curse upon
the successor to the throne of Jonoel.

19
00:02:02,840 --> 00:02:03,690
You.

20
00:02:08,620 --> 00:02:10,300
Let’s split up and search outside.

21
00:02:21,950 --> 00:02:23,870
By my power,

22
00:02:23,900 --> 00:02:25,980
I confine you,

23
00:02:26,010 --> 00:02:27,500
Ramil Soleil Jonoel.

24
00:02:27,990 --> 00:02:29,070
From now on,

25
00:02:29,800 --> 00:02:31,140
you shall be all alone,

26
00:02:31,740 --> 00:02:33,740
powerless,

27
00:02:34,070 --> 00:02:36,070
and trapped here forever.

28
00:02:36,810 --> 00:02:41,940
Lilith, why are you lowering yourself

29
00:02:41,970 --> 00:02:44,550
to follow the order of those rebel vampires?

30
00:02:46,150 --> 00:02:51,990
Even though it’s not right, I have to
comply with the summoner’s request.

31
00:02:55,030 --> 00:02:55,840
Methus!

32
00:03:18,610 --> 00:03:22,300
Worry not, Ramil Soleil Jonoel.

33
00:03:23,620 --> 00:03:25,000
Every curse

34
00:03:25,030 --> 00:03:28,440
can be broken when the time comes.

35
00:03:32,920 --> 00:03:37,120
And I shall reveal how to break the curse

36
00:03:37,170 --> 00:03:39,120
to all of you.

37
00:03:42,079 --> 00:03:46,320
You shall be confined to loneliness
by my curse.

38
00:03:46,360 --> 00:03:49,340
But as the Mother of Demons,

39
00:03:49,390 --> 00:03:52,190
I, too, shall be confined here with you.

40
00:03:56,680 --> 00:03:58,750
When ten decades have passed,

41
00:03:59,630 --> 00:04:04,880
the wheel of fate will bring the cursed
and the curse breaker to cross paths.

42
00:04:08,170 --> 00:04:10,170
With the blood of the curse breaker

43
00:04:10,220 --> 00:04:11,860
and the utterance of your name,

44
00:04:11,890 --> 00:04:15,300
my curse that has bound you shall vanish.

45
00:04:17,540 --> 00:04:19,640
You shall be granted a new life.

46
00:04:26,060 --> 00:04:30,320
Your dead heart will beat once more.

47
00:04:33,520 --> 00:04:39,900
For the curse breaker you choose
will be the one you love for eternity.

48
00:04:41,440 --> 00:04:43,860
So it’s you, Punn.

49
00:06:52,860 --> 00:06:53,920
How are you?

50
00:06:56,020 --> 00:06:57,100
I’m fine.

51
00:07:04,770 --> 00:07:09,260
Normally, we suppress our hunter instincts.

52
00:07:09,760 --> 00:07:11,110
We rarely show them.

53
00:07:12,600 --> 00:07:14,740
Methus didn’t mean to hurt you.

54
00:07:16,430 --> 00:07:17,960
Please don’t be angry at him.

55
00:07:20,380 --> 00:07:21,560
I understand.

56
00:07:23,290 --> 00:07:24,740
I’m not angry at him.

57
00:07:42,550 --> 00:07:43,280
Ouch.

58
00:07:43,940 --> 00:07:45,240
I’m sorry.

59
00:07:45,460 --> 00:07:48,990
I don’t usually treat wounds this way.

60
00:07:49,560 --> 00:07:50,909
I’ll be gentle.

61
00:08:19,610 --> 00:08:21,300
Thank you so much, Mr. Ramil.

62
00:08:24,860 --> 00:08:29,020
By the way, I have a question.

63
00:08:31,460 --> 00:08:34,220
Mr. Methus said you and I share a bond.

64
00:08:35,480 --> 00:08:37,010
What does that mean?

65
00:08:40,640 --> 00:08:44,190
When I was cursed and trapped in that
painting, the one who cursed me said that

66
00:08:45,940 --> 00:08:53,290
the one who’d set me free
would be the one I’d love for eternity.

67
00:08:59,290 --> 00:09:01,290
So that’s why you did that to me?

68
00:09:10,340 --> 00:09:14,050
Do you understand what you did?

69
00:09:20,060 --> 00:09:21,220
May I come in?

70
00:09:24,670 --> 00:09:25,750
Yes, come in.

71
00:09:25,770 --> 00:09:28,660
Mr. Ramil has told me everything.

72
00:09:36,320 --> 00:09:39,200
I’m sorry about what happened, Mr. Punn.

73
00:09:40,350 --> 00:09:43,990
And I’ve prepared what you asked, Master.

74
00:09:54,670 --> 00:09:55,910
What’s going on?

75
00:09:55,950 --> 00:09:59,180
Master asked me to buy new clothes
for you to wear while you stay here.

76
00:09:59,200 --> 00:10:00,170
While I stay here?

77
00:10:00,190 --> 00:10:02,000
Why do I have to stay here?

78
00:10:02,330 --> 00:10:04,330
To help Master regain his powers, of course.

79
00:10:06,700 --> 00:10:07,960
I can’t stay here.

80
00:10:08,010 --> 00:10:10,960
Why not? Is something wrong?

81
00:10:10,990 --> 00:10:12,370
You can tell Methus.

82
00:10:13,420 --> 00:10:15,710
I have something to finish.

83
00:10:16,050 --> 00:10:17,260
Restoring your painting.

84
00:10:18,310 --> 00:10:20,340
I have to get it done no matter what.

85
00:10:20,360 --> 00:10:22,340
Don’t worry about that, Mr. Punn.

86
00:10:22,740 --> 00:10:24,310
I’m the owner of the painting.

87
00:10:24,590 --> 00:10:26,120
As for your shop,

88
00:10:26,660 --> 00:10:28,720
I apologize for overstepping.

89
00:10:28,740 --> 00:10:32,060
WINNALA ANTIQUE BUYING, SELLING,
REPAIR & CONSERVATION

90
00:10:33,200 --> 00:10:35,250
For any customers you’ve made appointments with,

91
00:10:35,780 --> 00:10:38,420
I’ve already reached out
and compensated them.
SORRY, WE’RE TEMPORARILY CLOSED.

92
00:11:36,750 --> 00:11:38,000
Eternally.

93
00:11:54,100 --> 00:11:55,300
Methuselah.

94
00:11:56,960 --> 00:11:58,120
Ciaran.

95
00:12:00,100 --> 00:12:01,060
Marquise.

96
00:12:01,620 --> 00:12:03,650
Those are the names I originally gave them

97
00:12:10,900 --> 00:12:12,900
after they were reborn as vampires.

98
00:12:17,560 --> 00:12:19,290
But they’re probably too hard to pronounce,

99
00:12:20,020 --> 00:12:22,450
so they renamed themselves.

100
00:12:25,260 --> 00:12:27,260
That’s my family record.

101
00:12:35,900 --> 00:12:40,940
I can tell you’re still thinking about
what happened earlier this evening.

102
00:12:44,110 --> 00:12:48,050
When I kissed you.

103
00:12:55,340 --> 00:12:56,620
No way.

104
00:12:59,040 --> 00:13:01,040
I’ve seen it in the series.

105
00:13:01,420 --> 00:13:04,930
Isn’t that how humans normally show love?

106
00:13:12,100 --> 00:13:15,220
I didn’t do it without understanding
what it meant.

107
00:13:17,900 --> 00:13:21,050
I’m sleepy. I’m going to bed.

108
00:13:21,670 --> 00:13:26,780
Tomorrow, I have to take you to see
Mr. Mekhin and Mr. Ciar, as Mr. Methus said.

109
00:13:34,140 --> 00:13:35,860
Thank you so much, Punn,

110
00:13:36,730 --> 00:13:38,730
for staying here to help me.

111
00:13:41,450 --> 00:13:42,500
You know,

112
00:13:43,690 --> 00:13:45,270
this means a lot to me.

113
00:14:34,370 --> 00:14:36,140
Whoa! Mr. Ramil!

114
00:14:36,180 --> 00:14:37,420
How did you get in?

115
00:14:37,450 --> 00:14:39,210
I’ve been shouting for a long time,

116
00:14:39,240 --> 00:14:40,690
but you didn’t answer.

117
00:14:40,720 --> 00:14:42,690
I thought you were in danger.

118
00:14:43,420 --> 00:14:46,010
Methus said if something like that happened,

119
00:14:47,870 --> 00:14:49,300
I should break down the door to get in.

120
00:14:50,880 --> 00:14:53,500
Oh, one more thing.

121
00:14:53,530 --> 00:14:55,630
Methus gave me this.

122
00:14:58,860 --> 00:15:00,500
Let’s get going, Punn.

123
00:15:00,550 --> 00:15:02,890
Even though I’m not afraid of the sun,

124
00:15:02,930 --> 00:15:06,480
the midday heat can irritate my skin.

125
00:15:07,380 --> 00:15:08,060
Come on.

126
00:15:26,060 --> 00:15:27,780
Ouch.

127
00:15:49,640 --> 00:15:50,770
Please pause here.

128
00:15:52,410 --> 00:15:54,170
What do you see, Mr. Methus?

129
00:15:54,700 --> 00:15:55,940
It’s weird that those thieves

130
00:15:55,970 --> 00:15:59,040
only broke in to vandalize your painting.

131
00:16:00,460 --> 00:16:03,720
Are you sure you didn’t hurt someone
or make enemies somewhere?

132
00:16:06,550 --> 00:16:07,880
I didn’t before.

133
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:11,000
But now, I’m not so sure.

134
00:16:11,820 --> 00:16:15,340
Oh, please don’t joke like that, Mr. Methus.

135
00:16:15,380 --> 00:16:16,550
Neither should you, Jett.

136
00:16:17,130 --> 00:16:20,050
Let’s not make the situation worse.

137
00:16:20,960 --> 00:16:22,440
I’m not joking.

138
00:16:22,480 --> 00:16:24,990
Now that I’ve seen the CCTV footage

139
00:16:26,160 --> 00:16:28,160
and confirmed you two aren't the thieves,

140
00:16:28,860 --> 00:16:30,490
I don’t hold anything against you anymore.

141
00:16:31,340 --> 00:16:35,110
From now on, I’ll take care of
restoring the painting myself.

142
00:16:35,520 --> 00:16:37,820
You two don’t have to
take responsibility anymore.

143
00:16:40,810 --> 00:16:43,100
Jett, calm down.

144
00:16:43,480 --> 00:16:44,680
Let me handle it.

145
00:17:10,560 --> 00:17:11,540
We’ve arrived.

146
00:17:12,040 --> 00:17:14,160
This is where Mr. Ciar lives.

147
00:17:33,130 --> 00:17:34,630
Thank you.

148
00:17:35,620 --> 00:17:38,470
Thank you for choosing me, Master Ciar.

149
00:18:17,820 --> 00:18:19,610
Please help me, Master Ciar.

150
00:18:20,090 --> 00:18:22,260
I really can’t find my boyfriend.

151
00:18:22,300 --> 00:18:24,260
I don’t know where he is.

152
00:18:52,940 --> 00:18:54,340
Go find a new partner.

153
00:18:56,670 --> 00:18:58,160
Let that man go.

154
00:18:59,910 --> 00:19:03,060
He’s not worth your heartache.

155
00:19:04,430 --> 00:19:05,990
Don’t cry.

156
00:19:06,640 --> 00:19:08,640
Your pretty face might get messy
from the tears.

157
00:19:11,310 --> 00:19:12,950
Come closer.

158
00:19:17,630 --> 00:19:18,590
Closer.

159
00:19:32,780 --> 00:19:34,010
Master Ciar.

160
00:19:35,850 --> 00:19:36,760
What is it?

161
00:20:11,010 --> 00:20:12,480
My favorite.

162
00:20:16,920 --> 00:20:21,830
I heard from Methus that the curse has been
broken and you’ve awakened, Master.

163
00:20:22,180 --> 00:20:24,180
Then why didn’t you come to me right away, Ciar?

164
00:20:27,060 --> 00:20:33,190
Methus said you’re upset with me because
you’re not the one who broke my curse.

165
00:20:33,220 --> 00:20:34,260
I guess that’s true then.

166
00:20:34,300 --> 00:20:35,280
That tattletale.

167
00:20:35,570 --> 00:20:36,780
It’s been a hundred years,

168
00:20:36,810 --> 00:20:40,980
but that speedy prince is still
snitching on me to you.

169
00:20:41,190 --> 00:20:43,020
It’s been a hundred years,

170
00:20:43,670 --> 00:20:45,840
but you’re still acting like a kid, Ciar.

171
00:20:45,870 --> 00:20:49,640
That’s not true. Look around you.

172
00:20:51,140 --> 00:20:52,380
I’m a leader now.

173
00:20:52,940 --> 00:20:56,320
I have a hundred times more followers
than you.

174
00:20:58,320 --> 00:21:00,420
That’s because I chose to have only Methus,

175
00:21:02,300 --> 00:21:03,630
Mekhin,

176
00:21:07,380 --> 00:21:09,290
and you, Ciar.

177
00:21:09,330 --> 00:21:10,510
Please.

178
00:21:12,160 --> 00:21:15,260
No one has the patience to wait
a hundred years for you like Methus did.

179
00:21:16,830 --> 00:21:18,260
I’m sorry, Master.

180
00:21:18,290 --> 00:21:20,510
I’ve been living this life for decades.

181
00:21:21,380 --> 00:21:26,610
We’re not children
who have to follow you anymore.

182
00:21:28,960 --> 00:21:30,080
Okay, then.

183
00:21:35,550 --> 00:21:37,540
Let’s go, Punn.

184
00:21:41,140 --> 00:21:43,140
If you’re going to see Mekhin,

185
00:21:43,180 --> 00:21:45,140
I’ll have you know that he’s just like me.

186
00:21:45,580 --> 00:21:47,580
He’d never go back to you.

187
00:21:49,580 --> 00:21:51,150
I’m okay with that.

188
00:21:51,600 --> 00:21:56,270
Methus messaged me
about restoring your powers,

189
00:21:57,560 --> 00:21:59,270
but it’s not anytime soon, right?

190
00:22:00,350 --> 00:22:03,820
The emergency department
is really understaffed.

191
00:22:04,350 --> 00:22:06,740
We don’t have enough doctors
for the patients.

192
00:22:06,770 --> 00:22:09,820
After I perform a ritual to return the power
to you, I’ll need time to recover,

193
00:22:09,860 --> 00:22:11,950
and they’ll be in trouble here.

194
00:22:16,790 --> 00:22:18,130
I’m sorry, Master.

195
00:22:20,800 --> 00:22:24,010
It’s alright, Mekhin. I understand.

196
00:22:25,400 --> 00:22:29,290
I was happy to hear you’re working
to help humans here.

197
00:22:29,340 --> 00:22:33,470
I made the right decision
to give you my healing power.

198
00:22:35,890 --> 00:22:38,070
But I haven’t used that power at all.

199
00:22:39,300 --> 00:22:41,300
Since you were confined,

200
00:22:41,330 --> 00:22:43,690
I’ve tried not to use it.

201
00:22:44,580 --> 00:22:45,520
I’m a doctor,

202
00:22:45,560 --> 00:22:49,440
so I want to treat people the way doctors do.

203
00:22:51,680 --> 00:22:53,540
You’re amazing, Mekhin.

204
00:22:53,580 --> 00:22:56,620
While I was away, you guys have grown

205
00:22:56,650 --> 00:22:58,020
and gotten a lot better.

206
00:23:12,740 --> 00:23:14,340
No! Damn it!

207
00:23:14,750 --> 00:23:16,250
What the hell?

208
00:23:16,770 --> 00:23:18,940
Hey, let’s sit down.

209
00:23:30,630 --> 00:23:32,280
Those brothers seem really close.

210
00:23:32,690 --> 00:23:36,320
Look. What they’re playing looks fun.

211
00:23:38,450 --> 00:23:41,620
I don’t think they’re brothers.

212
00:23:41,990 --> 00:23:43,600
They’re probably friends.

213
00:23:58,620 --> 00:23:59,650
Mr. Ramil.

214
00:24:00,280 --> 00:24:01,960
Wait here. I’ll be right back.

215
00:24:02,410 --> 00:24:03,280
Okay.

216
00:24:10,520 --> 00:24:12,160
Move a bit to the right.

217
00:24:13,760 --> 00:24:15,130
Oh, we’ve used up all the money.

218
00:24:16,150 --> 00:24:17,270
I don’t have any left.

219
00:24:17,300 --> 00:24:18,390
It’s all gone.

220
00:24:18,420 --> 00:24:18,880
Let’s go home.

221
00:24:18,910 --> 00:24:20,070
Why are you staring at my face?

222
00:24:22,300 --> 00:24:23,470
Wait for me.

223
00:24:36,350 --> 00:24:37,170
Hey.

224
00:24:40,010 --> 00:24:41,800
I have two coins.

225
00:24:41,820 --> 00:24:44,020
You only get two chances to play, Mr. Ramil.

226
00:24:44,060 --> 00:24:44,950
Okay.

227
00:24:50,560 --> 00:24:52,560
This is used to control the directions.

228
00:24:52,590 --> 00:24:52,910
Look.

229
00:24:52,940 --> 00:24:53,440
Oh.

230
00:24:54,360 --> 00:24:54,810
Like this.

231
00:24:54,820 --> 00:24:55,550
Ah.

232
00:24:56,780 --> 00:24:59,900
Once you choose a doll, press here.

233
00:24:59,930 --> 00:25:01,900
It’ll pull it up for you.

234
00:25:01,940 --> 00:25:03,900
Left, right, left.

235
00:25:04,470 --> 00:25:05,300
Left.

236
00:25:05,330 --> 00:25:06,110
Mm-hmm.

237
00:25:11,610 --> 00:25:12,320
Oh.

238
00:25:14,500 --> 00:25:15,840
No!

239
00:25:17,990 --> 00:25:20,790
Punn, can I play again?

240
00:25:20,820 --> 00:25:22,100
One more time.

241
00:25:23,740 --> 00:25:24,990
This is your last chance.

242
00:25:25,020 --> 00:25:25,660
Mmm.

243
00:25:35,130 --> 00:25:36,300
I’m getting this one.

244
00:25:36,340 --> 00:25:38,030
Which one? The one in the middle?

245
00:25:39,030 --> 00:25:39,850
Here, control it.

246
00:25:40,880 --> 00:25:41,550
That’s it.

247
00:25:51,340 --> 00:25:52,700
No!

248
00:25:53,730 --> 00:25:56,100
Punn, can I play one more time?

249
00:25:56,920 --> 00:25:58,280
Please.

250
00:26:04,920 --> 00:26:06,450
No, Mr. Ramil.

251
00:26:07,680 --> 00:26:10,240
I got you this ice cream.

252
00:26:13,490 --> 00:26:14,240
Eat it.

253
00:26:17,260 --> 00:26:17,920
Hmm?

254
00:26:19,620 --> 00:26:20,860
Why is it so cold?

255
00:26:21,420 --> 00:26:24,560
It’s ice cream. Of course, it’s cold.

256
00:26:31,820 --> 00:26:33,140
Let’s go, Mr. Ramil.

257
00:26:33,180 --> 00:26:34,320
It’s time to leave.

258
00:26:35,490 --> 00:26:36,390
Come on.

259
00:26:38,530 --> 00:26:40,530
Can’t I play one more time?

260
00:26:41,340 --> 00:26:43,550
You only get two chances.

261
00:26:43,570 --> 00:26:45,060
I have no more coins.

262
00:26:46,030 --> 00:26:46,960
Let’s go.

263
00:26:51,330 --> 00:26:52,300
Come here.

264
00:26:52,310 --> 00:26:53,300
No.

265
00:27:00,290 --> 00:27:02,290
Take me here again sometime, Punn.

266
00:27:02,540 --> 00:27:04,290
I’m going to get you a doll.

267
00:27:38,320 --> 00:27:39,670
Thanks, Punn.

268
00:27:41,410 --> 00:27:43,970
I know you’re trying to comfort me.

269
00:27:46,300 --> 00:27:47,810
I’m not sad.

270
00:27:48,450 --> 00:27:52,570
I was just thinking about the time

271
00:27:55,270 --> 00:27:57,720
I used to hang out with them.

272
00:27:58,620 --> 00:27:59,880
We spent such a long time together

273
00:27:59,910 --> 00:28:01,700
that I think of them as my real brothers.

274
00:28:06,860 --> 00:28:10,980
Just the thought that we might not all be

275
00:28:14,040 --> 00:28:15,630
together again makes my heart sink.

276
00:28:17,140 --> 00:28:20,870
Ciar, Mekhin, and Methus,

277
00:28:21,640 --> 00:28:23,280
they were all once humans.

278
00:28:25,750 --> 00:28:27,290
I’m not surprised

279
00:28:28,220 --> 00:28:31,630
they’d rather live as humans
than as vampires.

280
00:28:33,640 --> 00:28:35,210
Actually,

281
00:28:35,790 --> 00:28:37,790
I think it’s better for them that way.

282
00:28:42,620 --> 00:28:44,300
You understand me, right?

283
00:28:45,210 --> 00:28:49,260
Yes, I do. I have a brother too.

284
00:28:50,620 --> 00:28:52,340
As a brother,

285
00:28:53,920 --> 00:28:58,790
you just want to choose a better life for them.

286
00:28:59,220 --> 00:29:00,140
I understand.

287
00:29:38,720 --> 00:29:41,440
It’s not mine. Whose phone is it?

288
00:29:43,080 --> 00:29:44,020
Is it yours?

289
00:29:45,740 --> 00:29:47,570
This thing was buzzing under my butt.

290
00:29:47,900 --> 00:29:50,510
Methus gave it to me this morning.

291
00:29:54,510 --> 00:29:56,720
Hello, Mr. Methus. It’s Punn.

292
00:29:57,310 --> 00:29:59,310
You’re with my master, right?

293
00:30:01,310 --> 00:30:05,860
Do you remember the vampire killers
who call themselves “Hunters”?

294
00:30:08,510 --> 00:30:10,710
I can now confirm

295
00:30:11,140 --> 00:30:14,020
they're the ones
who vandalized the painting at the gallery

296
00:30:16,940 --> 00:30:18,860
to break the curse.

297
00:30:20,140 --> 00:30:22,850
They’ve killed everyone else
in the Jonoel bloodline.

298
00:30:25,300 --> 00:30:28,700
Master Ramil is their next target.

299
00:30:35,180 --> 00:30:38,680
Alright, I’ll take him back to the hotel now.

300
00:30:38,720 --> 00:30:40,180
Please take care of him.

301
00:31:21,160 --> 00:31:23,710
Hey. Hold tight.

302
00:31:31,220 --> 00:31:33,800
They’re the hunters
Methus was talking about, aren’t they?

303
00:31:39,380 --> 00:31:40,060
Ouch!

304
00:31:40,090 --> 00:31:40,700
Punn!

305
00:31:41,100 --> 00:31:42,050
Are you okay?

306
00:31:42,080 --> 00:31:43,200
I’m fine.

307
00:31:53,780 --> 00:31:54,550
Hey!

308
00:32:00,200 --> 00:32:00,880
Hey!

309
00:33:25,610 --> 00:33:27,840
I told Master you wouldn’t come back.

310
00:33:28,420 --> 00:33:29,850
What are you doing here?

311
00:33:30,140 --> 00:33:31,930
I didn’t say I wouldn’t come back.

312
00:33:32,230 --> 00:33:33,660
You did, Ciar.

313
00:33:33,690 --> 00:33:37,260
You shouted to everyone on the day Master
was cursed that you wouldn’t come back

314
00:33:37,520 --> 00:33:41,560
because you were upset he didn’t
choose you to break the curse.

315
00:33:41,580 --> 00:33:42,660
That’s not true.

316
00:33:44,340 --> 00:33:45,460
You quack doctor.

317
00:33:51,010 --> 00:33:53,480
Leave me alone. Why are you following me?

318
00:33:54,960 --> 00:33:56,280
Stop being so loud.

319
00:33:56,650 --> 00:33:59,220
Learn to be considerate
of guests staying at this hotel.

320
00:34:01,680 --> 00:34:02,630
Let go!

321
00:34:03,860 --> 00:34:04,890
Let go of me!

322
00:34:14,929 --> 00:34:15,699
Punn.

323
00:34:20,260 --> 00:34:22,260
I don’t know why you’re mad at me,

324
00:34:23,620 --> 00:34:24,850
but let’s make up.

325
00:34:27,850 --> 00:34:28,820
I’m not mad.

326
00:34:30,110 --> 00:34:31,670
I’m just worried about you.

327
00:34:34,120 --> 00:34:35,690
You shouldn’t have done that.

328
00:34:35,739 --> 00:34:38,350
What if something had happened to you?

329
00:34:44,070 --> 00:34:47,699
If you’re worried about me and not mad,

330
00:34:48,380 --> 00:34:49,760
can we make up?

331
00:35:15,300 --> 00:35:18,580
I’m sorry I couldn’t protect you.

332
00:35:19,300 --> 00:35:20,260
You’re wrong.

333
00:35:22,370 --> 00:35:23,630
If it weren’t for you,

334
00:35:26,150 --> 00:35:28,410
I would’ve died the first day I got here.

335
00:35:29,720 --> 00:35:30,740
So…

336
00:35:32,780 --> 00:35:34,130
Don’t blame yourself.

337
00:36:05,780 --> 00:36:08,210
Sorry for interrupting, Master.

338
00:36:12,370 --> 00:36:13,920
Have you been here long?

339
00:36:13,950 --> 00:36:15,030
For a while.

340
00:36:17,290 --> 00:36:18,580
What the hell are you doing?

341
00:36:19,070 --> 00:36:20,120
Your hands are salty.

342
00:36:20,150 --> 00:36:21,410
I already washed them.

343
00:36:41,290 --> 00:36:43,140
Thank you, Mr. Mekhin.

344
00:36:43,180 --> 00:36:44,600
You’re welcome, Mr. Punn.

345
00:36:45,430 --> 00:36:48,530
I would’ve treated your wounds
the normal way,

346
00:36:48,580 --> 00:36:50,170
but it would’ve taken too long for Master.

347
00:36:50,660 --> 00:36:53,630
Especially the wounds on your cheeks.

348
00:37:06,540 --> 00:37:09,500
Where are the humans who attacked you?

349
00:37:09,540 --> 00:37:10,750
Why did you let them go?

350
00:37:12,120 --> 00:37:13,640
Why didn’t you kill them?

351
00:37:19,850 --> 00:37:23,250
You know my rules, Ciar.

352
00:37:24,110 --> 00:37:27,080
Every vampire born from my blood

353
00:37:27,490 --> 00:37:29,270
- cannot kill humans.
- cannot kill humans.

354
00:37:32,750 --> 00:37:35,580
Unless humans kill us first.

355
00:37:38,020 --> 00:37:40,260
Methus has probably told you.

356
00:37:40,290 --> 00:37:42,260
Over the hundred years you were away,

357
00:37:42,690 --> 00:37:44,890
our lineage has been hunted.

358
00:37:44,940 --> 00:37:48,420
Almost none of us
dare to reveal ourselves anymore.

359
00:37:49,450 --> 00:37:52,620
Even the purebloods in your family

360
00:37:53,110 --> 00:37:55,970
were all killed by those Hunters.

361
00:37:56,680 --> 00:37:58,680
You’re the only one who survived

362
00:38:01,300 --> 00:38:03,300
because you were sealed in the painting.

363
00:38:15,300 --> 00:38:20,100
And now you still want to trust humans
and spare their lives,

364
00:38:21,300 --> 00:38:22,480
Master Ramil?

365
00:38:34,650 --> 00:38:37,310
That’s why we need both of you

366
00:38:37,340 --> 00:38:39,730
to perform a ritual
to transfer the powers back to our Master.

367
00:38:40,380 --> 00:38:44,520
Once he gets the powers back
and becomes the leader again,

368
00:38:45,070 --> 00:38:46,810
we can put an end to all of this.

369
00:38:48,490 --> 00:38:50,290
It’s up to you.

370
00:38:52,420 --> 00:38:54,060
I don’t want to force you two.

371
00:38:55,570 --> 00:38:56,640
Mekhin.

372
00:38:58,930 --> 00:38:59,940
Ciar.

373
00:39:10,270 --> 00:39:11,480
Please excuse me.

374
00:39:12,030 --> 00:39:13,300
Goodbye, Mr. Punn.

375
00:39:13,980 --> 00:39:14,770
Goodbye.

376
00:39:22,430 --> 00:39:24,940
Are you sure this is a good idea, Master?

377
00:39:26,730 --> 00:39:30,380
I want them to decide for themselves,

378
00:39:31,830 --> 00:39:33,050
but I believe

379
00:39:34,260 --> 00:39:36,260
they’ll come back.

380
00:39:47,630 --> 00:39:49,630
If you’re worried about Master that much,

381
00:39:50,320 --> 00:39:53,120
why didn’t you just give him back his power?

382
00:39:59,120 --> 00:40:00,640
It’s been like 10 years,

383
00:40:01,540 --> 00:40:03,520
don’t you want to grab a drink with me?

384
00:40:04,770 --> 00:40:06,100
Next time.

385
00:40:07,050 --> 00:40:09,240
I’m on duty at the hospital later tonight.

386
00:40:09,670 --> 00:40:10,460
Hold on.

387
00:40:11,600 --> 00:40:13,600
Aren’t you the owner of the hospital?

388
00:40:14,030 --> 00:40:16,030
Don’t they find it suspicious at all?

389
00:40:16,050 --> 00:40:17,630
It’s been years,

390
00:40:17,670 --> 00:40:19,100
but you still haven’t graduated.

391
00:40:19,710 --> 00:40:21,900
You don’t have to be
so interested in my business.

392
00:40:24,820 --> 00:40:26,060
How are you leaving?

393
00:40:26,380 --> 00:40:29,920
Are you using
those stupid human transports again?

394
00:40:29,940 --> 00:40:32,580
Well, I don’t have wings like you.

395
00:40:34,880 --> 00:40:36,880
Watch out for the hunters.

396
00:40:38,620 --> 00:40:41,700
Watch out for the bird net traps.

397
00:40:44,100 --> 00:40:44,980
You quack doctor.

398
00:41:29,530 --> 00:41:30,660
(Hello, Mekhin.)

399
00:41:46,550 --> 00:41:47,820
(Hello? Mekhin?)

400
00:41:49,990 --> 00:41:52,260
Mr. Methus, you have 5 minutes.

401
00:41:57,700 --> 00:41:58,570
There are 3 here.

402
00:41:58,610 --> 00:41:59,700
What about over there?

403
00:42:03,890 --> 00:42:04,820
There are 8 here.

404
00:42:11,280 --> 00:42:12,840
Looks like I need to go help him over there,

405
00:42:14,070 --> 00:42:15,780
so let’s get this over with.

406
00:43:18,700 --> 00:43:19,530
Mekhin!

407
00:43:23,530 --> 00:43:25,270
You ran all the way here barefoot?

408
00:43:28,450 --> 00:43:32,940
You gave me 5 minutes. Shoes would’ve
gotten in the way of saving you in time.

409
00:43:34,040 --> 00:43:35,100
How’s Ciar?

410
00:43:35,840 --> 00:43:38,740
Don’t worry. Master offered
to go and help him himself.

411
00:43:41,170 --> 00:43:44,620
If he knew Master wanted to go
and help him, he’d be so happy.

412
00:43:47,620 --> 00:43:48,700
I don’t know about that.

413
00:43:49,130 --> 00:43:50,750
Master took Mr. Punn along.

414
00:43:52,060 --> 00:43:54,060
Too bad then.

415
00:43:55,040 --> 00:43:57,040
Ciar wants to be number one.

416
00:43:57,650 --> 00:44:02,300
That’s why he’s so against Mr. Punn
for stealing his title as Master’s favorite.

417
00:44:05,140 --> 00:44:06,490
Let’s get moving, Mekhin.

418
00:44:34,360 --> 00:44:35,740
You’re okay, right?

419
00:44:35,770 --> 00:44:36,740
I’m fine.

420
00:44:36,990 --> 00:44:39,080
I appreciate you coming to help me,

421
00:44:39,110 --> 00:44:40,360
but could you please let go?

422
00:44:40,400 --> 00:44:41,860
I’m going to handle this guy.

423
00:44:42,620 --> 00:44:43,420
Alright.

424
00:44:44,180 --> 00:44:46,180
Just make sure he can’t fight anymore.

425
00:44:46,580 --> 00:44:49,020
You can’t kill humans. That’s my rule.

426
00:44:49,060 --> 00:44:51,160
I don’t care about any damn rules.

427
00:44:52,210 --> 00:44:55,150
We’re vampires. Humans are our prey.

428
00:44:55,570 --> 00:44:59,290
If you want to protect humans,
then beat me at hunting them.

429
00:44:59,750 --> 00:45:02,450
I’ll spare anyone you save.

430
00:45:02,490 --> 00:45:04,900
I won’t kill them. Deal?

431
00:45:06,900 --> 00:45:12,160
If I win, you have to strictly follow my rules.

432
00:46:11,920 --> 00:46:13,290
How are you, Mr. Mekhin?

433
00:46:13,680 --> 00:46:16,490
I’m just a little tired
from using my power to heal myself.

434
00:46:17,610 --> 00:46:18,600
Where’s Master?

435
00:46:18,870 --> 00:46:21,100
Mr. Ramil used his speed
to get here before me.

436
00:46:21,450 --> 00:46:23,300
He’s worried Ciar might go too far.

437
00:46:25,480 --> 00:46:27,420
Hold on, Mr. Punn.

438
00:46:27,790 --> 00:46:28,980
It’s dangerous in there

439
00:46:29,010 --> 00:46:30,100
for humans.

440
00:46:32,420 --> 00:46:36,180
Can I see with my own eyes
that Mr. Ramil is safe?

441
00:46:38,780 --> 00:46:39,940
Alright, then.

442
00:46:40,310 --> 00:46:42,310
But you have to take good care of yourself.

443
00:46:43,090 --> 00:46:43,860
I will.

444
00:47:10,620 --> 00:47:12,470
It’s a tie, Master.

445
00:47:13,140 --> 00:47:16,430
You saved 4, I killed 4.

446
00:47:35,290 --> 00:47:36,700
This man is still alive.

447
00:47:38,160 --> 00:47:40,670
Mr. Mekhin, can you help him?

448
00:47:49,680 --> 00:47:51,390
You only killed 3.

449
00:47:52,970 --> 00:47:54,060
You lost.

450
00:47:56,760 --> 00:47:58,420
But if I kill another one,

451
00:48:00,140 --> 00:48:01,440
I won’t lose to you.

452
00:48:10,190 --> 00:48:11,320
Enough, Ciar.

453
00:48:17,740 --> 00:48:19,200
Stop it, Ciar.

454
00:48:19,540 --> 00:48:21,240
Accept it already.

455
00:48:21,290 --> 00:48:22,630
Mr. Punn is the one Master chose.

456
00:48:41,700 --> 00:48:43,000
It’s alright, Punn.

457
00:48:44,340 --> 00:48:45,850
No matter what happens,

458
00:48:51,310 --> 00:48:52,770
I’ll protect you.

459
00:49:09,140 --> 00:49:10,190
Damn it!

460
00:49:10,220 --> 00:49:11,880
MISSION FAILED.
SIGNAL CUT OFF.

461
00:50:08,420 --> 00:50:10,660
All Hunters, listen well.

462
00:50:12,550 --> 00:50:15,280
Even though our mission failed tonight,

463
00:50:15,310 --> 00:50:21,010
we’ll drink to honor our family
who sacrificed for our dream.

464
00:50:21,980 --> 00:50:23,630
Raise your glasses.

465
00:50:26,470 --> 00:50:30,020
Now drink as if it’s those vampires’
blood and souls.

466
00:50:31,180 --> 00:50:32,640
From now on,

467
00:50:34,320 --> 00:50:36,320
we will not back down.

468
00:50:37,390 --> 00:50:40,380
Not until their vampire lineage
is wiped from existence.

469
00:50:53,640 --> 00:50:57,270
I dreamed of having a small, peaceful house where I could grow flowers

470
00:50:57,780 --> 00:50:58,980
and live with someone I love.

471
00:51:00,400 --> 00:51:03,140
Is this place like what you dreamed of?

472
00:51:03,600 --> 00:51:05,120
Do you like it here?

473
00:51:08,030 --> 00:51:10,320
You trust humans too much.

474
00:51:13,230 --> 00:51:14,980
I’ll find the proof.
