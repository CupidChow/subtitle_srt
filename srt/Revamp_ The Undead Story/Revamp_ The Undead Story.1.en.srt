Are you real or just in my dream?

6
00:00:37,930 --> 00:00:39,000
Of course, I’m real, Punn.

7
00:00:39,460 --> 00:00:40,720
I really am.

8
00:00:42,860 --> 00:00:44,620
When will we see each other again?

9
00:00:45,260 --> 00:00:46,440
Someday.

10
00:00:56,560 --> 00:00:57,100
ALARM

11
00:01:05,800 --> 00:01:06,590
Shit.

12
00:01:07,090 --> 00:01:08,020
Not again.

13
00:01:28,150 --> 00:01:29,100
(Soon,)

14
00:01:29,120 --> 00:01:32,720
(we’ll see a painting
that’s over 100 years old,)

15
00:01:32,740 --> 00:01:34,860
(The Vampire of Greenmoore.)

16
00:01:34,880 --> 00:01:39,229
(It’s the highlight of the Undead Story
old painting exhibition,)

17
00:01:39,259 --> 00:01:44,820
(happening in a few days
at the Shikaaree Gallery.)

18
00:01:44,850 --> 00:01:49,960
(We’re with Mr. Jett, the gallery owner
and exhibition organizer.)

19
00:01:49,990 --> 00:01:52,100
(May I ask how you’re feeling?)

20
00:01:52,520 --> 00:01:58,940
I’m so honored that the artist, Methus Soleil,
has given our gallery permission

21
00:01:58,970 --> 00:02:03,170
to showcase the Vampire of Greenmoore
at the exhibition.

22
00:02:03,210 --> 00:02:09,020
(For the theme of immortal beings, no other
painting is more fitting as the highlight.)

23
00:02:09,039 --> 00:02:14,290
This one is believed to have
a real vampire sealed within.

24
00:02:22,610 --> 00:02:23,329
Coming.

25
00:02:23,380 --> 00:02:24,329

Here you go, Ma’am.

28
00:04:47,220 --> 00:04:48,440
Wow.

29
00:04:48,710 --> 00:04:50,990
I can barely see the crack now.

30
00:04:51,320 --> 00:04:54,310
I made the right call
getting it repaired here.

31
00:04:54,490 --> 00:04:56,310
Very neat work.

32
00:04:56,850 --> 00:05:00,680
If my great-grandpa were still alive,
he’d be so happy.

33
00:05:01,280 --> 00:05:04,380
This was his favorite vase.

34
00:05:05,030 --> 00:05:07,030
Thank you so much, Mr. Punn.

35
00:05:07,450 --> 00:05:08,860
You’re very welcome.

36
00:05:09,300 --> 00:05:12,510
We also offer a 15-day warranty after repair.

If there’s any damage caused by the repair,

38
00:05:14,970 --> 00:05:17,080
you can bring it back, and we’ll fix it for you.

00:05:26,130 --> 00:05:27,010
Thank you.

Thank you.

45
00:05:57,700 --> 00:05:58,340
What’s up?

46
00:05:59,610 --> 00:06:00,500
Let go of me!

47
00:06:09,840 --> 00:06:14,860
Do you know your opponent
got busted eyebrows and chin?

48
00:06:14,890 --> 00:06:17,810
And this is the fourth time this semester
it’s happened.

49
00:06:17,840 --> 00:06:20,530
You guys are still the same, always fighting.

50
00:06:21,020 --> 00:06:22,450
Go tell him.

51
00:06:22,480 --> 00:06:23,460
He’s the one who wouldn’t stop.

52
00:06:23,490 --> 00:06:24,160
Stop what?

53
00:06:24,180 --> 00:06:26,310
Making fun of me for being a foster kid.

54
00:06:26,340 --> 00:06:27,350
Pokpong!

55
00:06:45,250 --> 00:06:46,510
Aren’t you going to say anything?

56
00:06:50,060 --> 00:06:51,740
Hey! That hurts.

57
00:06:51,760 --> 00:06:52,750
What are you doing?

58
00:06:53,030 --> 00:06:53,930
It hurts, huh?

59
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:56,540
Then why did you get into a fight?

60
00:06:57,010 --> 00:06:58,460
Do you love being called to
the Student Welfare Department that much?

61
00:06:58,500 --> 00:06:59,690
Why are you being sarcastic?

62
00:06:59,720 --> 00:07:01,130
I’m already suspended from school
for a week.

63
00:07:01,160 --> 00:07:03,130
It’s not about how you’re punished
after doing something wrong.

64
00:07:03,780 --> 00:07:04,580
If you know it’s wrong,

65
00:07:04,600 --> 00:07:06,250
why did you do it in the first place?

66
00:07:07,650 --> 00:07:09,460
I know they started it,

67
00:07:10,740 --> 00:07:12,280
but can’t you just hold back?

68
00:07:13,030 --> 00:07:13,700
Why should I?

69
00:07:13,730 --> 00:07:14,810
So there wouldn’t be a problem.

70
00:07:14,840 --> 00:07:16,990
A problem? If anyone had a problem,
they could settle it with me.

71
00:07:20,370 --> 00:07:22,470
You don’t have to be such a troublemaker.

72
00:07:23,780 --> 00:07:28,660
If you think it’ll make that family want nothing
to do with you and leave you here,

73
00:07:29,460 --> 00:07:30,760
you’re wrong.

74
00:07:32,140 --> 00:07:33,990
Acting like a mess won’t help anything.

75
00:07:35,580 --> 00:07:38,680
Your new family is taking you abroad anyway.

76
00:07:39,110 --> 00:07:40,800
Why are you letting them take me?

77
00:07:44,960 --> 00:07:48,060
You promised me we’d move back together
when we grew up.

78
00:07:48,400 --> 00:07:51,900
Didn’t you say we brothers only had
each other left and you wouldn’t leave me?

79
00:07:51,930 --> 00:07:54,190
Why do you keep pushing me away
to be with other people?

80
00:07:57,900 --> 00:07:59,400
Moving abroad is a great opportunity.

81
00:08:00,540 --> 00:08:01,970
You can get higher education.

82
00:08:02,630 --> 00:08:03,830
Then get a good job.

83
00:08:05,600 --> 00:08:06,460
Why?

84
00:08:06,500 --> 00:08:08,210
Why do you always think
I’m pushing you away?

85
00:08:08,230 --> 00:08:10,210
Because you act like
you don’t want me at all.

86
00:08:12,300 --> 00:08:13,180
Pokpong.

87
00:08:14,940 --> 00:08:15,580
Pong.

88
00:08:16,880 --> 00:08:17,600
Pong.

89
00:08:22,300 --> 00:08:23,550
You know what, Punn?

90
00:08:24,860 --> 00:08:28,500
When the other kids call me a foster kid
to make fun of me, I just find it annoying.

91
00:08:28,530 --> 00:08:30,060
It never hurts my feelings.

92
00:08:31,020 --> 00:08:34,419
But when you keep pushing me
to become someone else’s family,

93
00:08:36,419 --> 00:08:39,559
it really makes me feel like
I’m an unwanted kid someone took in.

94
00:08:42,150 --> 00:08:46,260
Pong, it’s not like that.

95
00:08:46,710 --> 00:08:47,270
I just…

96
00:08:47,300 --> 00:08:49,500
I’m not going anywhere with that family.

97
00:08:49,540 --> 00:08:51,150
I’m staying here with you, Punn.

98
00:08:52,020 --> 00:08:54,260
And don’t worry about me being a burden.

99
00:08:54,300 --> 00:08:56,080
I’ve been working part-time

100
00:08:56,110 --> 00:08:57,780
and using my own money for a while now.

101
00:08:58,580 --> 00:08:59,940
I definitely won’t be your burden.

102
00:09:03,530 --> 00:09:06,070
Pong, you said you already quit.

103
00:09:06,090 --> 00:09:06,820
Pong!

104
00:09:10,850 --> 00:09:11,800
Pokpong!

105
00:09:13,110 --> 00:09:13,920
Pokpong!

106
00:09:17,770 --> 00:09:20,660
You two brothers still won’t stop fighting?

107
00:09:23,980 --> 00:09:25,270
What are you doing here?

108
00:09:44,500 --> 00:09:45,820
Why are you here?

109
00:09:46,340 --> 00:09:47,420
I have work to do.

110
00:09:57,290 --> 00:09:59,010
YOU DON’T NEED TO
WORK PART-TIME ANYMORE.

111
00:09:59,050 --> 00:10:02,050
TAKE THIS MONEY, BEHAVE YOURSELF,
AND GO HOME.

112
00:10:28,780 --> 00:10:29,900
What happened?

113
00:10:30,390 --> 00:10:33,540
Last night at my gallery.

114
00:10:44,360 --> 00:10:46,740
We’ve already asked the insurance company

115
00:10:46,770 --> 00:10:49,560
to assess the value of
the damage to the painting.

116
00:10:49,600 --> 00:10:53,020
We’ve had experts take an initial look,

117
00:10:53,050 --> 00:10:56,650
and they said that with skilled art restorers,

118
00:10:56,680 --> 00:10:59,680
the painting should be restorable
to its original state.

119
00:11:01,100 --> 00:11:08,150
Our gallery has a highly skilled restorer
who should be able to bring it back to 100%

120
00:11:09,550 --> 00:11:14,320
Well, maybe not 100%, but about 90%.

121
00:11:21,340 --> 00:11:23,790
Rest assured, Mr. Methus.

122
00:11:23,810 --> 00:11:27,270
Our gallery will take responsibility
for all the damage.

123
00:11:39,290 --> 00:11:40,800
Oh, Mr. Methus.

124
00:11:40,830 --> 00:11:42,910
Let me get a first-aid kit for you.

125
00:11:42,940 --> 00:11:44,020
Please wait a moment.

126
00:11:50,820 --> 00:11:53,690
It’s time, Master.

127
00:11:57,300 --> 00:11:59,620
The damage is estimated to be costly,

128
00:11:59,650 --> 00:12:01,940
so the insurance and I will each pay half.

129
00:12:02,530 --> 00:12:04,740
My gallery will surely be in the red this year.

130
00:12:05,790 --> 00:12:09,820
Luckily, the owner of the painting
agreed to have it restored.

131
00:12:11,120 --> 00:12:12,770
So Elise recommended you.

132
00:12:13,860 --> 00:12:17,540
But he wants to meet you
before he gives the final approval.

133
00:12:19,650 --> 00:12:20,870
That’s why I came here to ask

134
00:12:21,300 --> 00:12:23,300
if you’re willing to take this job.

135
00:12:35,300 --> 00:12:36,470
This will be the last one.

136
00:12:37,870 --> 00:12:41,870
After this, I promise I won’t bother you again.

137
00:13:41,130 --> 00:13:44,340
Mr. Methus is waiting inside
and he looks very irritated.

138
00:13:55,140 --> 00:13:56,620
Hello, Mr. Methus.

139
00:13:57,820 --> 00:14:02,140
This is Punn, our most talented restorer
at the moment.

140
00:14:09,340 --> 00:14:15,190
Apart from the restoration and the compensation, to show responsibility,

141
00:14:15,210 --> 00:14:21,940
our gallery is happy to showcase
as many of your artworks as you like.

142
00:14:21,960 --> 00:14:26,130
There will be no venue or processing fees.

143
00:14:34,320 --> 00:14:37,930
We apologize again, Mr. Methus.

144
00:14:37,970 --> 00:14:40,620
We’d like you to wait for the restoration first,

145
00:14:40,660 --> 00:14:42,980
and please don’t escalate this matter yet.

146
00:14:55,780 --> 00:14:59,970
Could you bring that painting back to life?

147
00:15:09,390 --> 00:15:10,330
Yes.

148
00:15:11,370 --> 00:15:14,520
I’ll bring that painting back to life.

149
00:15:42,360 --> 00:15:44,220
I’ll leave it to you then, Mr. Punn.

150
00:15:58,720 --> 00:15:59,930
What a poser.

151
00:16:00,320 --> 00:16:01,690
Please take care of it.

152
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:03,380
This client is so difficult.

153
00:16:04,660 --> 00:16:05,490
Mmm.

154
00:16:56,520 --> 00:16:57,080
Ouch!

155
00:18:22,460 --> 00:18:24,010
Remember my name.

156
00:18:24,880 --> 00:18:26,660
My name is

157
00:18:27,940 --> 00:18:28,850
Ramil.

158
00:18:41,490 --> 00:18:42,400
Who art thou?

159
00:18:43,140 --> 00:18:45,000
How dost thou know my name?

160
00:18:45,850 --> 00:18:49,810
I…I don’t know.

161
00:18:51,070 --> 00:18:52,100
And who are you?

162
00:18:52,570 --> 00:18:53,830
What are you exactly?

163
00:18:54,880 --> 00:18:56,140
What is this place?

164
00:19:02,420 --> 00:19:03,780
That necklace.

165
00:19:21,540 --> 00:19:24,430
I am

166
00:19:25,240 --> 00:19:26,560
a vampire.

167
00:19:27,110 --> 00:19:28,540
- Ugh.
- Hey!

168
00:19:35,210 --> 00:19:35,810
Ouch.

169
00:19:35,840 --> 00:19:36,720
Ouch!

170
00:19:38,270 --> 00:19:39,130
Ouch!

171
00:19:58,980 --> 00:20:00,000
Ouch.

172
00:20:00,020 --> 00:20:01,220
Ouch!

173
00:20:01,240 --> 00:20:02,490
Ouch!

174
00:20:02,530 --> 00:20:03,720
Ouch!

175
00:20:03,740 --> 00:20:04,580
My leg!

176
00:20:04,610 --> 00:20:06,820
Ouch! That hurts!

177
00:20:06,840 --> 00:20:07,890
Do you have a cramp?

178
00:20:07,940 --> 00:20:09,380
Ouch! That hurts!

179
00:20:09,420 --> 00:20:11,010
Ouch! That hurts!

180
00:20:11,740 --> 00:20:13,060

Ouch!

My leg!

184
00:20:17,290 --> 00:20:18,490
Ouch!

185
00:20:39,110 --> 00:20:39,820
Hey.

186
00:20:41,730 --> 00:20:42,430
Hey.

187
00:20:44,280 --> 00:20:45,190
Hey.

188
00:20:45,220 --> 00:20:46,660
Are you asleep? Hey!

189
00:20:46,680 --> 00:20:47,500
Hey!

190
00:20:49,730 --> 00:20:51,910
Ouch! I am hungry.

191
00:20:52,340 --> 00:20:53,140
Ouch!

Hey.

196
00:21:07,450 --> 00:21:08,460
Careful.

197
00:21:22,560 --> 00:21:23,570
Hold on.

198
00:21:49,070 --> 00:21:50,380
(Is it done?)

199
00:21:52,160 --> 00:21:54,480
Not yet. It’s more difficult than I thought.

200
00:21:56,010 --> 00:21:57,620
I’ll probably need a few more days.

201
00:21:57,660 --> 00:21:59,980
(What do you mean? What happened?)

202
00:22:06,130 --> 00:22:07,290
Nothing.

203
00:22:09,140 --> 00:22:11,580
I’d like a few days to work on it at home.

204
00:22:13,440 --> 00:22:14,540
(Are you sure)

205
00:22:15,180 --> 00:22:16,580
there’s no problem?

206
00:22:18,440 --> 00:22:19,440
Don’t worry.

207
00:22:20,620 --> 00:22:22,620
I’ll get the job done like I always do.

208
00:22:29,620 --> 00:22:30,420
I am hungry.

209
00:22:59,780 --> 00:23:00,500
Jett.

210
00:23:02,640 --> 00:23:03,500
Jett.

211
00:23:05,340 --> 00:23:06,260
Jett.

212
00:23:08,260 --> 00:23:09,690
It’s time to leave.

213
00:23:09,730 --> 00:23:11,570
The kids have all gone to bed.

214
00:23:11,610 --> 00:23:13,820

Hey, if you’re hungry, go ahead and eat.

217
00:24:00,820 --> 00:24:01,900
We can talk later.

218
00:24:11,130 --> 00:24:12,200
It’s hot.

219
00:24:13,340 --> 00:24:14,340
Blow on it first.

220
00:24:21,560 --> 00:24:22,400
Who art thou?

221
00:24:25,120 --> 00:24:26,320
My name is Punn.

222
00:24:26,510 --> 00:24:28,520
I should be the one asking who you are.

223
00:24:28,800 --> 00:24:32,790
How did you get out of that painting?

224
00:24:34,340 --> 00:24:37,290
I told thee already, I am a vampire.

225
00:24:39,660 --> 00:24:45,020
But you don’t look anything like
the kind of vampires I know.

226
00:24:46,930 --> 00:24:49,470
What are those vampires like?

227
00:24:54,700 --> 00:24:56,460
Hast thou met them before?

228
00:24:56,870 --> 00:24:57,530
Uh…

229
00:25:02,300 --> 00:25:03,620
Hast thou met them?

230
00:25:06,110 --> 00:25:07,010
Well?

231
00:25:34,460 --> 00:25:37,800
This is Dracula, the vampire I know.

232
00:25:37,840 --> 00:25:39,280
He’s a blood-sucking creature.

233
00:25:39,730 --> 00:25:41,820
He has fangs and is scary and intimidating.

234
00:25:44,020 --> 00:25:45,580
He looks nothing like you.

235
00:25:55,710 --> 00:25:58,620
I can do that too.

236
00:26:18,960 --> 00:26:20,110
But I shall not.

237
00:26:20,610 --> 00:26:22,160
I do not like drinking human blood.

238
00:26:31,680 --> 00:26:33,050
It seems

239
00:26:33,070 --> 00:26:35,050
thou dost still not believe I am a vampire.

240
00:26:37,160 --> 00:26:39,640
I shall show thee my powers.

241
00:26:46,310 --> 00:26:47,450
Transformation.

242
00:26:53,940 --> 00:26:54,940
Transformation.

243
00:26:56,530 --> 00:26:58,200
’Tis not working.

244
00:27:00,660 --> 00:27:02,240
Is my power gone?

245
00:27:03,100 --> 00:27:06,250
I can show thee another power.

246
00:27:12,490 --> 00:27:13,340
Speed.

247
00:27:21,220 --> 00:27:22,040
Speed.

248
00:27:26,550 --> 00:27:29,520
Hey, I think you should stop.

249
00:27:29,820 --> 00:27:32,340
Also, if you’re not going to
call me by my name,

250
00:27:32,370 --> 00:27:34,170
just call me “you”

251
00:27:34,200 --> 00:27:35,820
and call yourself “I.”

252
00:27:36,120 --> 00:27:37,940
When you call me “thee”,

253
00:27:38,380 --> 00:27:40,360
It feels like I’m in a period drama.

254
00:27:42,990 --> 00:27:44,060
What drama?

255
00:27:45,470 --> 00:27:46,480
A period drama.

256
00:27:46,860 --> 00:27:47,850
Period?

257
00:27:51,520 --> 00:27:52,580
By the way, dost thou know—

258
00:27:52,620 --> 00:27:58,340
do you know why my kind is in that thing?

259
00:27:58,380 --> 00:28:00,420
That thing is called a TV.

260
00:28:01,120 --> 00:28:03,120
You’re watching a series.

261
00:28:03,160 --> 00:28:04,500
It’s not real.

262
00:28:06,780 --> 00:28:07,990
So that means

263
00:28:08,340 --> 00:28:12,240
vampires on TV,

264
00:28:13,710 --> 00:28:15,100
they’re not real?

265
00:28:15,380 --> 00:28:16,180
Yeah.

266
00:28:17,560 --> 00:28:19,860
Then can I watch the…

267
00:28:19,880 --> 00:28:20,590
Series?

268
00:28:21,550 --> 00:28:23,550
Yes, can I watch the series?

269
00:28:23,770 --> 00:28:24,450
Okay.

270
00:28:25,180 --> 00:28:26,050
Go ahead and watch.

271
00:28:26,080 --> 00:28:27,020
I’m going to take a shower.

272
00:28:27,060 --> 00:28:27,770
Mmm.

273
00:28:37,990 --> 00:28:39,420
(There’s one last condition.)

274
00:28:43,500 --> 00:28:46,060
(If the president gets hungry,)

275
00:28:46,100 --> 00:28:50,880
(the secretary has to give it to him
until he’s satisfied.)

276
00:28:52,310 --> 00:28:52,980
Ahem.

277
00:28:55,510 --> 00:28:57,160
You can sleep here tonight.

278
00:29:01,140 --> 00:29:01,970
What about you?

279
00:29:05,460 --> 00:29:07,360
I’m going to sleep in my bedroom.

280
00:29:08,070 --> 00:29:09,500
What’s your bedroom like?

281
00:29:09,520 --> 00:29:10,600
There’s a bed, right?

282
00:29:12,890 --> 00:29:14,710
Can’t I sleep there too?

283
00:29:16,180 --> 00:29:17,180
Of course not.

284
00:29:17,210 --> 00:29:19,030
Who would let a stranger into their bedroom?

285
00:29:19,460 --> 00:29:20,270
Come on.

286
00:29:20,300 --> 00:29:22,510
You brought me to your house.

287
00:29:22,540 --> 00:29:25,800
Just letting me sleep in your bedroom
wouldn't bother you that much, right?

288
00:29:25,850 --> 00:29:27,030
It would.

289
00:29:30,390 --> 00:29:31,590
It’d make me feel uncomfortable.

290
00:29:34,550 --> 00:29:38,720
Fine. I don’t want to bother you
any further anyway.

291
00:29:48,250 --> 00:29:49,730
I won’t give in.

292
00:29:49,770 --> 00:29:52,160
You should sleep. It’s very late.

293
00:29:53,190 --> 00:29:54,630
Stop watching the series.

294
00:29:54,660 --> 00:29:57,910
Mmm, can’t I watch
at least one more episode?

295
00:29:57,940 --> 00:30:02,310
I’m researching
how vampires can win humans’ hearts.

296
00:30:18,160 --> 00:30:21,340
What if I do that?

297
00:30:24,320 --> 00:30:26,330
Would you let me sleep in your bed?

298
00:30:37,470 --> 00:30:38,220
I guess not.

299
00:32:33,910 --> 00:32:35,620
My name is

300
00:32:36,540 --> 00:32:37,380
Ramil.

301
00:33:06,620 --> 00:33:08,510
Last night, I watched a series on TV.

302
00:33:09,040 --> 00:33:12,980
I don’t get why humans think
our kind is afraid of garlic.

303
00:33:13,790 --> 00:33:15,500
Why would we be afraid of garlic?

304
00:33:15,530 --> 00:33:17,000
It’s just a vegetable.

305
00:33:19,180 --> 00:33:22,180
Add that green thing, Methus.

306
00:33:23,500 --> 00:33:24,850
I don’t know what it’s called.

307
00:33:26,700 --> 00:33:28,930
It’s called broccoli, Master.

308
00:33:29,150 --> 00:33:30,740
Yes, that’s what I meant.

309
00:33:33,420 --> 00:33:36,660
Punn probably likes it. His fridge is full of it.

310
00:33:37,410 --> 00:33:41,950
I think the fact that he has so much left
means he doesn’t like it.

311
00:33:44,180 --> 00:33:48,200
Then I’ll make him like it. I want to repay him.

312
00:33:51,610 --> 00:33:54,670
In that case, you should
do the frying yourself.

313
00:33:56,540 --> 00:34:01,340
But you better not. I’m worried
you might set his house on fire.

314
00:34:13,719 --> 00:34:14,780
You’re up, Punn.

315
00:34:28,820 --> 00:34:29,370
You.

316
00:34:29,400 --> 00:34:30,650
Thank you, Mr. Punn.

317
00:34:32,810 --> 00:34:35,889
Thank you for setting my master free.

318
00:34:51,370 --> 00:34:53,260
Hey, Methus. It’s burning!

319
00:34:53,659 --> 00:34:55,699
It’s because of your green veggie, Master.

320
00:34:55,739 --> 00:34:57,630
- Add more so it won’t burn.
- Add more?

321
00:34:57,660 --> 00:34:58,790
I think this is already a lot.

322
00:35:40,060 --> 00:35:41,930
This hotel is owned by the Jonoel family.

323
00:35:41,960 --> 00:35:42,930
I manage it.

324
00:35:42,970 --> 00:35:46,250
The family penthouse is on the top floor.

325
00:35:56,250 --> 00:35:57,140
After you.

326
00:36:07,720 --> 00:36:11,020
This whole floor is for
guests of the Jonoel family.

327
00:36:11,380 --> 00:36:13,530
But ever since Master was sealed away,

328
00:36:13,900 --> 00:36:15,720
there haven’t been many guests.

329
00:36:22,740 --> 00:36:23,830
Mr. Punn,

330
00:36:24,320 --> 00:36:26,760
do you know any legends about vampires?

331
00:36:34,760 --> 00:36:38,810
We’ve lived long, immortal lives

332
00:36:38,840 --> 00:36:41,750
hidden among humans for generations.

333
00:36:45,060 --> 00:36:48,610
Master Ramil is the last descendant
of our vampire lineage.

334
00:36:56,330 --> 00:36:57,740
Make yourself at home, Mr. Punn.

335
00:36:58,040 --> 00:36:58,870
Please have a seat.

336
00:36:58,890 --> 00:37:00,460
I’ll get you something to drink.

337
00:37:00,490 --> 00:37:01,260
Okay.

338
00:37:06,490 --> 00:37:08,020
What would you like to drink?

339
00:37:09,300 --> 00:37:11,390
Oh, water, please.

340
00:37:16,460 --> 00:37:17,920
Don’t worry, Punn.

341
00:37:18,820 --> 00:37:21,760
I told you I don’t drink human blood.

342
00:37:48,490 --> 00:37:50,340
Are you guys really vampires?

343
00:37:50,380 --> 00:37:52,940
You still don’t believe us?

344
00:37:54,250 --> 00:37:55,590
How should I prove it?

345
00:37:56,440 --> 00:37:58,050
I’m currently powerless.

346
00:37:59,420 --> 00:38:01,740
Methus, you have my power of speed.

347
00:38:01,770 --> 00:38:03,020
Show it to Punn.

348
00:38:03,910 --> 00:38:05,010
It’s okay.

349
00:38:06,900 --> 00:38:09,200
Let’s say you really are vampires.

350
00:38:11,900 --> 00:38:13,740
Why did you bring me here?

351
00:38:16,610 --> 00:38:18,320
I helped your master last night

352
00:38:18,350 --> 00:38:19,750
because he passed out.

353
00:38:19,770 --> 00:38:22,380
Now you can just take him back.

354
00:38:23,370 --> 00:38:26,520
You set my master free.

355
00:38:28,060 --> 00:38:29,720
But now he’s powerless.

356
00:38:30,060 --> 00:38:33,660
I need to perform a ritual
to restore his powers.

357
00:38:35,100 --> 00:38:36,580
What does that have to do with me?

358
00:38:38,380 --> 00:38:41,900
Every vampire ritual requires human blood.

359
00:38:44,140 --> 00:38:46,980
You’re a human who shares a bond with him.

360
00:38:49,220 --> 00:38:50,360
So,

361
00:38:50,790 --> 00:38:52,720
we’ll probably need your blood, Mr. Punn.

362
00:38:52,880 --> 00:38:53,770
Hold on.

363
00:38:54,100 --> 00:38:56,200
You guys can’t just use my blood.

364
00:38:56,230 --> 00:38:57,280
I want nothing to do with it.

365
00:39:06,230 --> 00:39:07,010
You.

366
00:39:07,500 --> 00:39:09,000
Please, Mr. Punn.

367
00:39:10,020 --> 00:39:13,650
I’m begging you to help my master again.

368
00:39:27,060 --> 00:39:28,620
Does it hurt?

369
00:39:29,970 --> 00:39:31,120
It’s fine.

370
00:39:33,120 --> 00:39:36,380
Human blood is the best medium.

371
00:39:38,220 --> 00:39:43,500
We just need half a cup of your blood
for the ritual.

372
00:39:43,820 --> 00:39:47,020
I hope you can understand
why we need to do this.

373
00:39:53,340 --> 00:39:57,330
Master Ramil must regain all his powers

374
00:39:57,720 --> 00:40:00,970
so we can appoint him as our leader again.

375
00:40:07,980 --> 00:40:10,440
Our lineage is in need of a leader

376
00:40:12,610 --> 00:40:17,400
because we’re all being hunted
by people who call themselves "Hunters."

377
00:40:20,060 --> 00:40:22,410
The only one who can save us

378
00:40:22,920 --> 00:40:24,690
is Master Ramil.

379
00:40:36,710 --> 00:40:38,260
Where are Ciar and Mekhin?

380
00:40:38,910 --> 00:40:42,110
I’ve reached out to both of them, but…

381
00:40:42,140 --> 00:40:42,900
It’s okay.

382
00:40:44,540 --> 00:40:46,440
I’m going to find them myself

383
00:40:46,470 --> 00:40:48,380
and bring them back to Jonoel.

384
00:41:04,010 --> 00:41:06,220
Aaaah!

385
00:41:13,210 --> 00:41:14,560
Wait, Mr. Methus.

386
00:41:15,420 --> 00:41:18,120
You said Mr. Ramil and I share a bond.

387
00:41:18,150 --> 00:41:19,560
What does that mean?

388
00:41:20,700 --> 00:41:23,260
You’re the one who released him
from the seal.

389
00:41:23,720 --> 00:41:25,650
Only you can do it.

390
00:41:27,030 --> 00:41:28,200
Why me?

391
00:41:29,020 --> 00:41:31,900
Because Master Ramil has chosen you.

392
00:41:34,760 --> 00:41:35,880
I don’t understand.

393
00:41:38,230 --> 00:41:42,070
When the time is right, you will.

394
00:41:47,810 --> 00:41:48,850
Mr. Punn,

395
00:41:49,660 --> 00:41:54,190
I want you to close the door
and don’t leave the room until I call you.

396
00:41:56,000 --> 00:41:57,160
Wait, Mr. Methus.

397
00:41:57,600 --> 00:41:58,790
Please trust me.

398
00:41:59,210 --> 00:42:01,210
It’s for your safety.

399
00:42:03,790 --> 00:42:05,460
Aaaah!

400
00:42:05,490 --> 00:42:06,500
Mr. Methus.

401
00:42:10,740 --> 00:42:11,650
Mr. Methus.

402
00:42:11,690 --> 00:42:13,580
Aaaah!

403
00:42:20,230 --> 00:42:22,750
Aaaah!

404
00:42:24,840 --> 00:42:26,100
Mr. Methus, what’s going on?

405
00:42:26,930 --> 00:42:27,530
Hey!

406
00:42:36,730 --> 00:42:38,000
What did I tell you?

407
00:42:38,030 --> 00:42:40,000
Go back to your room right now!

408
00:44:05,660 --> 00:44:06,620
Mr. Methus.

409
00:44:24,420 --> 00:44:25,570
Mr. Ramil.

410
00:44:52,930 --> 00:44:53,580
Punn.

411
00:45:03,420 --> 00:45:05,000
Where are Ciar and Mekhin?

412
00:45:05,210 --> 00:45:08,790
I’ve reached out to both of them, but…

413
00:45:18,190 --> 00:45:19,570
Hi, nurses.

414
00:45:27,070 --> 00:45:31,020
OUR MASTER IS BACK.

415
00:45:36,380 --> 00:45:37,460
Doctor.

416
00:45:38,210 --> 00:45:39,380
Doctor!

417
00:45:39,420 --> 00:45:39,710
Yes?

418
00:45:39,740 --> 00:45:40,480
Are you free?

419
00:45:40,510 --> 00:45:41,710
I need your help.

420
00:45:41,740 --> 00:45:43,140
Oh, sure.

421
00:45:43,170 --> 00:45:43,820
Come on.

422
00:45:44,620 --> 00:45:46,620
You can have this.

423
00:45:46,650 --> 00:45:47,620
Thank you.

424
00:45:48,340 --> 00:45:49,700
This way, Doctor.

425
00:45:50,890 --> 00:45:51,900
Here are the gloves.

426
00:45:52,800 --> 00:45:54,800
The patient has a cut on his head.

427
00:46:05,850 --> 00:46:06,910
Doctor.

428
00:46:07,880 --> 00:46:08,860
Doctor.

429
00:46:09,290 --> 00:46:10,680
Are you okay?

430
00:46:11,570 --> 00:46:12,320
Yes.

431
00:46:14,660 --> 00:46:15,850
This will hurt a bit.

432
00:46:29,960 --> 00:46:30,980
Really?

433
00:46:32,530 --> 00:46:34,760
Our Master is finally back?

434
00:46:35,340 --> 00:46:37,500
Who released him?

435
00:46:40,170 --> 00:46:41,230
A human?

436
00:46:42,900 --> 00:46:44,260
Interesting.

437
00:46:46,180 --> 00:46:48,180
Let’s prepare to welcome him.

438
00:46:54,980 --> 00:46:56,360
Thank you so much, Punn,

439
00:46:57,430 --> 00:46:59,220
for staying here to help me.

440
00:47:00,710 --> 00:47:03,940
You know, it means a lot to me.

441
00:47:07,540 --> 00:47:09,000
I’m a leader now.

442
00:47:09,240 --> 00:47:12,330
We’re not children who have to follow you anymore.

443
00:47:13,990 --> 00:47:15,520
(Hello, Mekhin.)

444
00:47:17,750 --> 00:47:19,750
Mr. Methus, you have 5 minutes.
