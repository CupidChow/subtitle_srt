Viewer discretion is advised.

5
00:00:16,920 --> 00:00:19,200
So, did you get the solid proof you were looking for?

6
00:00:25,680 --> 00:00:28,200
I’ll become the most pitiful vampire

7
00:00:28,200 --> 00:00:31,600
if you decide to leave me in the end.

8
00:00:32,960 --> 00:00:34,680
I’ll stay here with you.

9
00:00:40,800 --> 00:00:45,040
IT’S TIME FOR YOU TO DEAL WITH THE TARGET.

10
00:01:04,160 --> 00:01:06,200
(It’s been over a week)

11
00:01:06,240 --> 00:01:08,200
(since I accepted the mission from Jett.)

12
00:01:10,200 --> 00:01:11,120
This will be the last one.

13
00:01:11,920 --> 00:01:13,080
After this,

14
00:01:13,320 --> 00:01:15,520
I promise I won’t bother you again.

15
00:01:19,080 --> 00:01:21,080
(Punn, you said you’ve seen
the necklace before.)

16
00:01:21,640 --> 00:01:27,080
(If your memory is correct,
I think it was him that night.)

17
00:01:30,720 --> 00:01:35,200
(Like Master said, you’re the only one
who can break his curse.)

18
00:01:54,240 --> 00:01:55,200
Ouch!

19
00:01:55,240 --> 00:01:56,280
Ouch!

20
00:01:56,840 --> 00:02:00,880
(My mission is to kill you.)

21
00:02:01,680 --> 00:02:02,960
Hey.

22
00:02:40,600 --> 00:02:41,440
Punn!

23
00:02:43,640 --> 00:02:44,760
I’m fine.

24
00:02:51,280 --> 00:02:53,079
I’ll always protect you

25
00:02:53,120 --> 00:02:54,680
for as long as you want me to.

26
00:02:58,840 --> 00:03:03,720
(But right now, the way I feel about you)

27
00:03:05,160 --> 00:03:06,640
(has changed.)

28
00:05:38,960 --> 00:05:41,720
Do vampires not usually wear
proper pajamas?

29
00:05:43,040 --> 00:05:44,040
Aren’t you cold?

30
00:06:02,360 --> 00:06:03,640
I’m not cold.

31
00:06:04,160 --> 00:06:05,400
Are you?

32
00:06:11,080 --> 00:06:12,480
Of course, I’m cold.

33
00:06:16,320 --> 00:06:17,600
Let me help

34
00:06:17,960 --> 00:06:19,560
make you warm.

35
00:06:23,200 --> 00:06:24,320
Hey!

36
00:06:36,840 --> 00:06:37,680
Hey!

37
00:06:50,040 --> 00:06:54,720
Thanks for deciding to stay here with me.

38
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:14,760
Hey,

39
00:07:15,080 --> 00:07:17,080
I’m going home for a bit.

40
00:07:19,160 --> 00:07:22,920
I need to take care of something.

41
00:07:40,840 --> 00:07:42,600
I’m not running away.

42
00:07:44,480 --> 00:07:46,600
I’ll be back as soon as I can.

43
00:07:53,960 --> 00:07:54,600
Hey.

44
00:07:57,960 --> 00:07:58,680
Hey.

45
00:08:04,160 --> 00:08:06,160
You’re unbelievable.

46
00:08:07,040 --> 00:08:10,120
Alright, I’ll let you go home.

47
00:08:12,120 --> 00:08:16,120
But promise me you’ll come back.

48
00:08:17,320 --> 00:08:18,440
I’ll be waiting.

49
00:08:21,800 --> 00:08:22,640
Okay.

50
00:08:29,920 --> 00:08:31,880
You can play, but be gentle, okay?

51
00:08:37,200 --> 00:08:42,000
WINNALA ANTIQUE BUYING, SELLING,
REPAIR & CONSERVATION

52
00:08:49,200 --> 00:08:51,840
CONTACT ME WHEN YOU GET HOME.
I’M WORRIED ABOUT YOU. - PONG

53
00:10:54,840 --> 00:10:58,000
IT’S TIME FOR YOU
TO DEAL WITH THE TARGET.

54
00:11:00,240 --> 00:11:03,280
JETT, I NEED TO TALK TO YOU GUYS.

55
00:11:03,320 --> 00:11:06,480
LET’S MEET AT ORION.

56
00:11:14,480 --> 00:11:18,040
You take good care of these flowers, Master.

57
00:11:19,200 --> 00:11:24,440
Punn likes roses. When he comes back and sees them, he should be in a good mood.

58
00:11:25,600 --> 00:11:27,720
Where is he?

59
00:11:28,480 --> 00:11:30,480
He went home to take care of something.

60
00:11:33,600 --> 00:11:34,800
By the way, Methus,

61
00:11:35,600 --> 00:11:40,880
I’m thinking of expanding the flower garden to cover the whole rooftop.

62
00:11:42,440 --> 00:11:46,120
Punn told me he wanted a house
with a big flower garden.

63
00:11:51,960 --> 00:11:55,280
You like him very much, don’t you?

64
00:11:59,480 --> 00:12:01,320
You know the answer, Methus.

65
00:12:05,160 --> 00:12:11,560
If he weren’t the one who broke your curse, would you still like him?

66
00:12:14,240 --> 00:12:17,440
Of course, I chose him myself.

67
00:12:26,760 --> 00:12:27,840
Master.

68
00:12:32,800 --> 00:12:34,080
I’m just thinking

69
00:12:35,080 --> 00:12:37,440
maybe you should consider what Ciar said

70
00:12:41,200 --> 00:12:41,960
about Mr. Punn.

71
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:42,600
Methus.

72
00:12:45,320 --> 00:12:49,880
Of everyone around me, I trust you the most.

73
00:12:51,400 --> 00:12:53,520
Please don’t turn into another Ciar.

74
00:13:00,040 --> 00:13:02,360
This should be enough
to make Master believe

75
00:13:02,360 --> 00:13:04,840
that Punn is really one of the Hunters.

76
00:13:08,320 --> 00:13:10,120
Hey, what are you doing?

77
00:13:10,160 --> 00:13:12,240
I’m going to tell Master about this myself.

78
00:13:12,280 --> 00:13:13,600
You guys stay put.

79
00:13:14,800 --> 00:13:15,200
But…

80
00:13:15,200 --> 00:13:16,480
Let Methus handle it.

81
00:13:16,520 --> 00:13:18,320
Master listens to him the most.

82
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:24,080
Got it.

83
00:13:29,160 --> 00:13:34,800
When you have time, can you find some more beautiful roses to add to the garden?

84
00:13:37,360 --> 00:13:39,040
Of course, Master.

85
00:13:47,040 --> 00:13:49,080
Master is crazy about that human?

86
00:13:54,040 --> 00:13:56,920
Huginn, Muminn,

87
00:13:58,640 --> 00:14:02,760
keep a close eye on Punn and the Hunters.

88
00:14:37,400 --> 00:14:41,080
There’s no way you can escape
my raven eyes.

89
00:14:59,520 --> 00:15:00,320
Knock, knock.

90
00:15:02,040 --> 00:15:03,440
What, Doctor?

91
00:15:03,840 --> 00:15:06,280
Did you finish all the jelly candy I gave you?

92
00:15:06,320 --> 00:15:07,840
Why are you smoking again?

93
00:15:08,480 --> 00:15:09,880
You only gave me a little.

94
00:15:09,920 --> 00:15:11,080
Of course, I already finished it.

95
00:15:12,160 --> 00:15:13,760
How about this?

96
00:15:14,360 --> 00:15:16,360
I’ll buy you a lot more,

97
00:15:16,880 --> 00:15:18,800
so you won’t have to smoke again.

98
00:15:19,280 --> 00:15:20,280
There’s no need.

99
00:15:24,400 --> 00:15:26,400
I threw that away for you.

100
00:15:27,320 --> 00:15:28,160
Great.

101
00:15:31,200 --> 00:15:34,640
By the way, did you just get here for work?

102
00:15:34,960 --> 00:15:37,120
Yes, I’m on the late-night shift.

103
00:15:37,120 --> 00:15:38,960
What about you, Pokpong?

104
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:40,360
I’m about to clock out.

105
00:15:45,240 --> 00:15:46,080
Doctor…

106
00:15:47,960 --> 00:15:49,520
Can I get your advice on something?

107
00:15:52,600 --> 00:15:54,200
Do you have any siblings?

108
00:15:54,920 --> 00:15:56,000
Hmm.

109
00:15:57,000 --> 00:16:00,920
You could say that. Why do you ask?

110
00:16:02,360 --> 00:16:06,240
I had a fight with my older brother
and it seems like he’s been avoiding me.

111
00:16:07,360 --> 00:16:09,680
Actually, we don’t live together.

112
00:16:11,480 --> 00:16:13,480
Our parents died when we were young.

113
00:16:14,080 --> 00:16:16,200
A foster family took me in,

114
00:16:16,880 --> 00:16:19,120
but my brother had to live in an orphanage.

115
00:16:20,480 --> 00:16:25,120
We were separated
until we reconnected recently.

116
00:16:26,760 --> 00:16:30,600
But it seems like
he’s hiding something from me

117
00:16:36,120 --> 00:16:39,000
and I can’t really get through to him.

118
00:16:42,120 --> 00:16:44,440
I think I get it.

119
00:16:44,880 --> 00:16:51,320
The feeling of not knowing who you are
and not knowing where you belong.

120
00:16:52,840 --> 00:16:54,560
Living with your family doesn’t feel right,

121
00:16:55,200 --> 00:16:57,200
but living with your brother
isn’t the answer either.

122
00:16:58,160 --> 00:17:02,040
Whoa. You read my mind.

123
00:17:02,800 --> 00:17:05,040
Are you a doctor or a fortune teller?

124
00:17:06,079 --> 00:17:09,960
Let’s just say you’re not the only one
who feels that way.

125
00:17:10,880 --> 00:17:12,480
Me too.

126
00:17:15,119 --> 00:17:16,680
Do you want to talk about it?

127
00:17:17,800 --> 00:17:20,800
Maybe another time.
My night shift starts soon.

128
00:17:26,720 --> 00:17:28,440
Anyway,

129
00:17:29,080 --> 00:17:30,800
if I were your brother,

130
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:35,160
I’d want you to be able to
share your feelings with me.

131
00:17:37,560 --> 00:17:41,400
Why don’t you try telling him how you feel?

132
00:17:42,120 --> 00:17:45,880
Talk to him with reason
and listen to him with reason too.

133
00:17:47,120 --> 00:17:48,840
That’ll help you open up more easily.

134
00:17:50,320 --> 00:17:53,800
He’s your brother, after all.

135
00:17:56,960 --> 00:17:59,680
Keep me posted.

136
00:18:00,200 --> 00:18:01,040
I will.

137
00:18:19,840 --> 00:18:22,480
Hey, here you are, handsome.

138
00:18:22,840 --> 00:18:24,080
What happened here?

139
00:18:24,120 --> 00:18:26,960
The vampire named Ciar invaded.

140
00:18:27,520 --> 00:18:30,160
What? Why haven’t I heard anything?

141
00:18:31,560 --> 00:18:33,800
We tried reaching out to you several times,

142
00:18:33,840 --> 00:18:35,240
but your phone was off.

143
00:18:35,280 --> 00:18:36,000
Yeah.

144
00:18:36,240 --> 00:18:37,480
We get it, though.

145
00:18:37,880 --> 00:18:39,760
You’re infiltrating the enemy.

146
00:18:39,800 --> 00:18:40,240
Understandable.

147
00:18:40,280 --> 00:18:41,720
You must have no time to answer calls.

148
00:18:41,760 --> 00:18:42,680
We get it.

149
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:44,800
By the way,

150
00:18:44,840 --> 00:18:46,440
I guess you asked us to meet here

151
00:18:47,280 --> 00:18:53,160
because you have updates
about their powers?

152
00:18:54,200 --> 00:18:54,960
Do you?

153
00:18:55,280 --> 00:18:56,040
At least a bit?

154
00:18:58,480 --> 00:18:59,880
Look at that face.

155
00:18:59,920 --> 00:19:01,200
- Silence.
- I guess not then.

156
00:19:01,240 --> 00:19:04,120
After you sent us info about Methus,

157
00:19:04,520 --> 00:19:05,800
I already made the bullets.

158
00:19:06,120 --> 00:19:07,640
The ones to reduce speed.

159
00:19:07,680 --> 00:19:10,280
Please! Speed, my ass!

160
00:19:10,320 --> 00:19:11,920
Don’t listen to him, Punn.

161
00:19:11,960 --> 00:19:14,800
His bullets couldn’t even slow them down
for 10 seconds.

162
00:19:14,800 --> 00:19:17,520
If vampires were old people,
they’d still walk faster than that.

163
00:19:17,560 --> 00:19:18,040
How do they walk?

164
00:19:18,040 --> 00:19:18,520
Where’s Jett?

165
00:19:19,920 --> 00:19:23,240
Oh, he’s in his office.

166
00:19:23,280 --> 00:19:25,080
He and Elise are waiting for you.

167
00:19:26,560 --> 00:19:27,840
Ouch!

168
00:19:27,880 --> 00:19:28,960
He’s so strong.

169
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:30,120
He almost broke my shoulder.

170
00:19:30,120 --> 00:19:30,720
Let’s go.

171
00:19:30,760 --> 00:19:31,520
Yeah.

172
00:19:31,560 --> 00:19:32,360
Where’s Jett?

173
00:19:32,360 --> 00:19:32,960
What?

174
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:33,840
Where’s Jett?

175
00:19:33,880 --> 00:19:34,800
Come on.

176
00:19:34,840 --> 00:19:36,040
Where’s Jett?

177
00:19:53,320 --> 00:19:54,840
Just say it, Punn.

178
00:19:54,880 --> 00:19:56,840
You wanted to see all of us today

179
00:19:56,880 --> 00:19:59,280
because you have something important
to tell us, right?

180
00:20:04,600 --> 00:20:06,200
I’m withdrawing from the mission.

181
00:20:06,240 --> 00:20:06,920
Huh?

182
00:20:07,480 --> 00:20:09,280
What do you mean?

183
00:20:09,320 --> 00:20:11,040
Did they catch you?

184
00:20:12,160 --> 00:20:12,880
No.

185
00:20:15,280 --> 00:20:16,840
I don’t want to do it anymore.

186
00:20:17,280 --> 00:20:18,480
I don’t want to lie.

187
00:20:18,960 --> 00:20:20,560
I don’t want to kill anyone anymore.

188
00:20:21,160 --> 00:20:22,600
No, Punn.

189
00:20:22,960 --> 00:20:24,520
We agreed on this, remember?

190
00:20:24,560 --> 00:20:26,600
You can get that close to our target.

191
00:20:26,640 --> 00:20:29,520
Only you can finish the mission.

192
00:20:30,080 --> 00:20:32,200
You can’t back out like this.

193
00:20:33,600 --> 00:20:35,160
I’m sorry, Elise.

194
00:20:35,800 --> 00:20:36,960
So you’ve been hesitating

195
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:41,320
and stalling for time all along because of this.

196
00:20:42,600 --> 00:20:44,440
Did you forget

197
00:20:44,480 --> 00:20:46,080
what they did?

198
00:20:46,120 --> 00:20:47,960
That was 10 years ago.

199
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:49,400
You can’t use that

200
00:20:49,440 --> 00:20:51,440
to force everyone to do what you want.

201
00:20:53,680 --> 00:20:54,480
Jett!

202
00:20:56,160 --> 00:20:57,080
Jett!

203
00:20:58,520 --> 00:21:00,720
Let me remind you, Punn.

204
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:02,400
Just that night alone,

205
00:21:03,160 --> 00:21:04,480
they killed the people we love.

206
00:21:04,520 --> 00:21:06,000
They killed our family.

207
00:21:06,040 --> 00:21:07,480
They almost killed me,

208
00:21:08,040 --> 00:21:09,120
Elise,

209
00:21:09,160 --> 00:21:10,640
and you too.

210
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:14,680
Do you still think I’m demanding, huh?

211
00:21:14,720 --> 00:21:15,480
Stop!

212
00:21:17,200 --> 00:21:19,480
Jett, that’s enough!

213
00:21:19,520 --> 00:21:21,160
Enough, both of you!

214
00:21:23,280 --> 00:21:25,160
If you’re still hesitating like this,

215
00:21:26,840 --> 00:21:29,000
then you’re not fit for the mission.

216
00:21:31,600 --> 00:21:33,120
You’re just going to end up dead.

217
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:44,000
We’ll take it from here.

218
00:21:45,200 --> 00:21:48,160
You can leave and go be with your brother.

219
00:21:49,960 --> 00:21:51,400
Don’t ever come back here.

220
00:22:14,720 --> 00:22:17,000
Get up, Master. Come with me.

221
00:22:18,440 --> 00:22:20,120
Where are you taking him?

222
00:22:20,160 --> 00:22:22,280
I’m going to make him see for himself

223
00:22:22,320 --> 00:22:25,520
that Punn is really part of the group
that’s trying to kill him.

224
00:22:29,880 --> 00:22:31,080
Wait, Punn.

225
00:22:32,920 --> 00:22:34,520
Please don’t be mad at Jett.

226
00:22:37,880 --> 00:22:40,280
He didn’t want to drag you back into this.

227
00:22:40,280 --> 00:22:44,320
He knows you want to quit
because Pokpong is moving in with you.

228
00:22:45,280 --> 00:22:48,720
We tried using Paul and Caster,

229
00:22:48,760 --> 00:22:50,720
but the mission failed.

230
00:22:52,800 --> 00:22:57,480
I’m the one who asked Jett
to bring you back.

231
00:22:58,680 --> 00:23:01,440
You might think this is silly,

232
00:23:01,960 --> 00:23:06,200
but what happened that night
is still stuck in my mind.

233
00:23:07,400 --> 00:23:13,720
I still have bad dreams every night about you and me hiding from them under the bed.

234
00:23:14,120 --> 00:23:15,720
You know what, Punn?

235
00:23:16,520 --> 00:23:18,520
What happened that night

236
00:23:19,480 --> 00:23:21,560
feels like it just happened yesterday.

237
00:23:24,120 --> 00:23:29,920
If they’re still alive, who knows who else would have to go through what we did?

238
00:23:30,640 --> 00:23:32,640
I don’t want it to happen again.

239
00:23:33,240 --> 00:23:35,240
I don’t want anyone to experience loss,

240
00:23:35,280 --> 00:23:38,480
and I don’t want to lose anyone again.

241
00:23:45,640 --> 00:23:48,120
This is made from the info you gave us.

242
00:23:57,360 --> 00:24:00,720
I know you don’t want to kill anyone,

243
00:24:00,760 --> 00:24:03,160
but we don’t have to kill all the vampires,

244
00:24:03,160 --> 00:24:05,160
I just need you to kill one!

245
00:24:06,720 --> 00:24:12,240
If you can deal with the last descendant
of Jonoel, it’ll all be over, Punn.

246
00:24:13,640 --> 00:24:15,600
You’ll get to live a normal life.

247
00:24:16,040 --> 00:24:20,080
You’ll get to live with Pokpong
without having to hide who you are.

248
00:24:34,160 --> 00:24:35,120
I’m not going.

249
00:24:36,200 --> 00:24:38,280
You wanted me to find proof, didn’t you?

250
00:24:38,840 --> 00:24:42,120
I’m taking you to see it with your own eyes.

251
00:24:42,800 --> 00:24:44,640
That human has been lying to you.

252
00:24:44,680 --> 00:24:46,280
I’ll wait for Punn here.

253
00:24:48,400 --> 00:24:49,680
I trust him.

254
00:24:52,680 --> 00:24:53,560
You’re just…

255
00:24:56,280 --> 00:24:57,080
so obsessed with that human,

256
00:24:57,120 --> 00:24:58,760
you’ve become deaf and blind
to everything else.

257
00:25:09,840 --> 00:25:10,680
Let go!

258
00:25:11,000 --> 00:25:11,880
Where are you going?

259
00:25:12,160 --> 00:25:13,120
I don’t know.

260
00:25:13,680 --> 00:25:15,240
If they want to kill our Master,

261
00:25:15,680 --> 00:25:17,400
I’m going to kill them first.

262
00:25:17,440 --> 00:25:18,880
I’m not going to sit around like you.

263
00:25:19,440 --> 00:25:21,440
But our Master doesn’t allow us
to kill humans.

264
00:25:21,480 --> 00:25:23,400
Use your own brain for a change, Methus.

265
00:25:23,800 --> 00:25:26,880
You don’t have to act like a butler
and follow his orders all the time.

266
00:25:28,880 --> 00:25:31,080
Watch your mouth.

267
00:25:31,720 --> 00:25:34,800
Don’t make me lose it and break your neck.

268
00:25:38,720 --> 00:25:41,440
Fine, I hear you.

269
00:25:42,120 --> 00:25:43,320
Let go of me.

270
00:25:52,680 --> 00:25:54,040
What do we do next?

271
00:26:03,360 --> 00:26:05,160
I just need you to kill one!

272
00:26:05,560 --> 00:26:10,760
If you can deal with the last descendant
of Jonoel, it’ll all be over.

273
00:26:10,760 --> 00:26:12,680
You’ll get to live a normal life.

274
00:26:13,120 --> 00:26:17,200
You’ll get to live with Pokpong
without having to hide who you are.

275
00:26:22,280 --> 00:26:23,080
Pong.

276
00:26:24,240 --> 00:26:25,760
Where have you been?

277
00:26:26,560 --> 00:26:30,560
I texted you that I went on a work trip
to another city.

278
00:26:31,360 --> 00:26:32,840
I have to go to work now.

279
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:35,280
Is everything okay?

280
00:26:35,840 --> 00:26:37,200
Have you gone home at all?

281
00:26:40,120 --> 00:26:41,680
Don’t call them.

282
00:26:45,240 --> 00:26:47,400
I just want to talk to you nicely today.

283
00:26:53,200 --> 00:26:55,880
All this time, I’ve been acting like a mess

284
00:26:56,880 --> 00:26:58,880
because I want my new family to leave me.

285
00:27:00,680 --> 00:27:03,040
I never saw them as my family.

286
00:27:04,760 --> 00:27:07,160
You’re my only family, Punn.

287
00:27:10,200 --> 00:27:14,880
But I didn’t consider that you might be uncomfortable about me moving in.

288
00:27:17,040 --> 00:27:19,240
Every time I try to get close to you,

289
00:27:19,560 --> 00:27:20,960
you try to avoid me.

290
00:27:21,000 --> 00:27:22,400
It’s not like that, Pong.

291
00:27:23,640 --> 00:27:28,080
I’m not uncomfortable. I just have a reason.

292
00:27:33,720 --> 00:27:35,880
It’s not that I don’t want to live with you.

293
00:27:35,920 --> 00:27:39,440
I promise I’ll listen to your reason carefully.

294
00:27:45,320 --> 00:27:46,480
No, Pong.

295
00:27:49,320 --> 00:27:54,560
My only reason is I don’t want you
to get involved in the things I do.

296
00:27:58,560 --> 00:28:00,560
Once I’ve dealt with everything,

297
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:03,600
we can talk about this again.

298
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:10,120
I thought if I opened up to you,

299
00:28:10,800 --> 00:28:12,400
you’d do the same.

300
00:28:13,720 --> 00:28:15,200
I guess I was wrong.

301
00:28:19,040 --> 00:28:19,800
Pong!

302
00:29:06,680 --> 00:29:07,600
It’s okay.

303
00:30:00,120 --> 00:30:02,120
This reminds me of the first day I met you.

304
00:30:03,920 --> 00:30:06,280
You didn’t even know
how to eat instant noodles back then.

305
00:30:08,280 --> 00:30:09,720
But look at you now.

306
00:30:11,040 --> 00:30:13,040
You can even make them for me.

307
00:30:18,920 --> 00:30:21,200
This is the only dish I can make.

308
00:30:25,600 --> 00:30:33,120
Hmm…looking back, what made you
dare to let me into your house?

309
00:30:34,200 --> 00:30:35,960
Weren’t you scared of me at all?

310
00:30:38,160 --> 00:30:39,800
You’re not scary at all.

311
00:30:40,720 --> 00:30:42,440
And even if you’d thought of hurting me,

312
00:30:43,800 --> 00:30:45,800
I’d have been able to fight back.

313
00:30:51,080 --> 00:30:52,160
What about now?

314
00:30:54,240 --> 00:30:55,800
Are you scared of me?

315
00:30:57,920 --> 00:30:59,720
I didn’t have my powers then,

316
00:31:00,840 --> 00:31:03,280
but now I have them all back.

317
00:31:06,640 --> 00:31:11,120
No, if you really were going to hurt me,

318
00:31:11,600 --> 00:31:14,320
you wouldn’t have made me instant noodles.

319
00:31:18,320 --> 00:31:19,680
Who knows?

320
00:31:19,720 --> 00:31:22,360
I might’ve added poison to your bowl.

321
00:31:24,200 --> 00:31:25,120
Really?

322
00:31:25,480 --> 00:31:26,240
Yeah.

323
00:31:37,440 --> 00:31:38,840
I didn’t add any!

324
00:31:45,160 --> 00:31:47,000
I’m just kidding, Mr. Ramil.

325
00:31:51,160 --> 00:31:55,720
I’m glad to see you happy
when you’re with me.

326
00:32:34,880 --> 00:32:36,880
Can I sleep in your room tonight?

327
00:32:37,440 --> 00:32:38,880
I don’t want to sleep alone.

328
00:32:40,640 --> 00:32:41,760
Come in.

329
00:32:51,960 --> 00:32:53,600
The roses still haven’t wilted?

330
00:32:55,400 --> 00:32:57,520
I use my power to preserve them,

331
00:32:57,880 --> 00:32:59,320
waiting for you to come back.

332
00:33:03,080 --> 00:33:06,680
Can I go up to the garden
tomorrow morning?

333
00:33:06,720 --> 00:33:08,200
I’ll arrange new roses for you.

334
00:33:09,160 --> 00:33:13,760
Of course. You can go up there
anytime you want.

335
00:33:14,440 --> 00:33:15,520
You have my permission.

336
00:33:16,160 --> 00:33:17,240
Thank you.

337
00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:19,000
You should sleep.

338
00:33:37,800 --> 00:33:41,440
Aren’t you going to sleep?

339
00:33:44,080 --> 00:33:48,080
I’d rather you sleep here.

340
00:34:28,400 --> 00:34:29,199
Hey.

341
00:34:32,280 --> 00:34:33,400
I’m cold.

342
00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:51,280
Good night, Punn.

343
00:35:31,640 --> 00:35:37,640
3 MIRACULOUSLY SURVIVE FIRE THAT KILLED CHILDREN AND CAREGIVERS
AT MICHAEL ORPHANAGE

344
00:35:49,440 --> 00:35:51,280
Punn, wake up!

345
00:35:52,120 --> 00:35:53,040
Where’s Jett?

346
00:36:09,200 --> 00:36:10,680
Let go of Jett!

347
00:37:34,080 --> 00:37:35,800
What are you doing up here?

348
00:37:42,080 --> 00:37:43,360
You couldn’t sleep?

349
00:37:46,560 --> 00:37:49,120
Yeah, I couldn’t sleep.

350
00:37:58,120 --> 00:38:01,000
So I came to get some roses.

351
00:38:02,320 --> 00:38:04,640
I was planning to replace
the ones in your vase in the morning.

352
00:38:18,640 --> 00:38:20,200
Don’t avoid my eyes, Punn.

353
00:38:22,440 --> 00:38:24,440
I’m reading your mind.

354
00:38:32,960 --> 00:38:38,080
Let me feel and understand your pain.

355
00:38:40,320 --> 00:38:42,320
Let me help carry it.

356
00:40:54,320 --> 00:40:56,320
What happened to me last night?

357
00:40:58,760 --> 00:41:00,040
Nothing.

358
00:41:01,240 --> 00:41:04,520
You just fell asleep in my arms.

359
00:41:05,440 --> 00:41:08,880
And you tossed and turned a bit.

360
00:41:15,560 --> 00:41:16,560
By the way,

361
00:41:17,160 --> 00:41:18,640
why did you bring the vase in here?

362
00:41:19,920 --> 00:41:20,880
Oh,

363
00:41:21,240 --> 00:41:25,720
I told you last night I’d replace the flowers.

364
00:41:26,960 --> 00:41:28,560
I couldn’t really sleep,

365
00:41:29,160 --> 00:41:31,320
so I went up to the rooftop garden,

366
00:41:31,320 --> 00:41:34,840
cut some roses, and made a new arrangement for your vase.

367
00:41:36,280 --> 00:41:38,280
You went to the rooftop?

368
00:41:42,760 --> 00:41:46,680
You were there with me, weren’t you?

369
00:41:49,680 --> 00:41:50,720
Me?

370
00:41:58,920 --> 00:42:00,360
Excuse me for a moment.

371
00:42:36,520 --> 00:42:37,360
Punn,

372
00:42:37,640 --> 00:42:38,760
is something wrong?

373
00:42:38,760 --> 00:42:41,080
Can I go up to the rooftop garden?

374
00:42:41,360 --> 00:42:43,760
I want to cut some fresh roses
and replace the ones in your vase.

375
00:42:50,160 --> 00:42:51,280
I don’t want to trouble you.

376
00:42:51,880 --> 00:42:53,560
Not at all.

377
00:42:53,880 --> 00:42:55,240
Please let me go up there.

378
00:43:00,040 --> 00:43:03,880
Master, I want to talk to you
about something important.

379
00:43:06,280 --> 00:43:07,400
Privately.

380
00:43:28,440 --> 00:43:32,160
Ciar got this photo from the pub
where the Hunters gather.

381
00:43:33,520 --> 00:43:35,280
The owner of that pub is Mr. Jett,

382
00:43:35,320 --> 00:43:39,320
He’s also the gallery owner who asked me to showcase the painting you were trapped in.

383
00:43:39,800 --> 00:43:46,680
Actually, I’ve been suspicious of their connection, so I dug up more documents.

384
00:43:58,360 --> 00:44:01,800
The three of them are survivors
of a massacre,

385
00:44:01,840 --> 00:44:05,080
which I think is linked to vampires.

386
00:44:21,120 --> 00:44:21,680
Ouch!

387
00:44:24,720 --> 00:44:27,360
Aren’t you going to do something?

388
00:44:28,560 --> 00:44:30,360
What else am I supposed to do, Methus?

389
00:44:31,520 --> 00:44:33,640
I’ve done everything I can.

390
00:44:41,840 --> 00:44:45,200
Mr. Punn, what are you doing up here?

391
00:44:58,200 --> 00:45:02,360
I came to get some flowers
to arrange in the vase for Mr. Ramil.

392
00:45:04,800 --> 00:45:08,320
Once you’re done,
please meet Master downstairs.

393
00:45:09,080 --> 00:45:10,640
He’s waiting for you.

394
00:45:13,680 --> 00:45:14,360
Okay.

395
00:45:17,880 --> 00:45:19,400
Thank you

396
00:45:22,880 --> 00:45:25,240
for releasing Master from the curse

397
00:45:26,280 --> 00:45:29,120
and helping restore his four powers.

398
00:45:34,200 --> 00:45:35,720
Four?

399
00:45:36,560 --> 00:45:37,400
That’s right.

400
00:45:44,040 --> 00:45:45,640
Apart from speed,

401
00:45:46,360 --> 00:45:47,640
transformation,

402
00:45:48,240 --> 00:45:49,840
and healing,

403
00:45:51,320 --> 00:45:53,000
what's the other one?

404
00:45:54,440 --> 00:45:59,240
The power that makes him
the strongest leader of the vampires.

405
00:46:01,120 --> 00:46:02,600
Mind reading.

406
00:46:23,080 --> 00:46:25,400
That’s what you’ve been looking for, isn’t it?

407
00:46:34,640 --> 00:46:38,120
Tell me how you did it.

408
00:46:53,960 --> 00:46:55,960
You know who I am

409
00:46:58,160 --> 00:46:59,800
and why I approached you.

410
00:47:03,240 --> 00:47:05,600
I’d rather hear it from you.

411
00:47:09,640 --> 00:47:11,640
I’m one of the Hunters.

412
00:47:13,280 --> 00:47:16,160
I hunt your Jonoel vampire lineage.

413
00:47:20,040 --> 00:47:26,160
My only goal in coming here is to kill you.

414
00:47:34,000 --> 00:47:35,080
In that case,

415
00:47:48,760 --> 00:47:50,760
do what you have to do, Punn.

416
00:47:52,200 --> 00:47:53,280
Kill me.

417
00:47:56,680 --> 00:48:00,160
I won’t run away or fight back.

418
00:48:01,880 --> 00:48:03,320
I’ll stand right here.

419
00:48:04,240 --> 00:48:05,840
You’re willing to die for me?

420
00:48:07,840 --> 00:48:09,160
Why?

421
00:48:10,800 --> 00:48:15,840
All this time I’ve spent with you
has given me enough happiness.

422
00:48:16,840 --> 00:48:20,640
If I have to die, I’ll have no regrets.

423
00:48:22,200 --> 00:48:27,840
If I have to die by your hands, I’m willing to.

424
00:48:30,400 --> 00:48:32,400
I came here to kill you,

425
00:48:34,880 --> 00:48:38,320
but you still trust me
and let me stay by your side.

426
00:48:39,640 --> 00:48:45,280
You’re so stupid for choosing to trust me.

427
00:48:53,120 --> 00:48:54,680
Don’t hesitate, Punn.

428
00:48:56,200 --> 00:49:00,120
Kill me, so you can finally be free.

429
00:49:12,760 --> 00:49:13,800
Enough!

430
00:49:19,720 --> 00:49:21,440
I really can’t do it.

431
00:49:22,640 --> 00:49:24,640
I really can’t kill you.

432
00:49:50,840 --> 00:49:53,120
You must’ve been hurting all along.

433
00:50:42,440 --> 00:50:47,880
From now on, let me take care of your heart.

434
00:51:12,960 --> 00:51:14,360
I love you, Punn.

435
00:51:16,840 --> 00:51:20,320
I love you too, Mr. Ramil.

436
00:53:22,560 --> 00:53:25,880
I spent time with you to sort out my own feelings.

437
00:53:28,680 --> 00:53:31,600
If you don’t want to get involved in this anymore,

438
00:53:31,640 --> 00:53:34,320
you must get over Ramil.
