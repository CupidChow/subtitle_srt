Characters, actions, places, occupations, and events in this series

2
00:00:06,960 --> 00:00:09,870
are fictional and created for entertainment purposes only.

3
00:00:09,900 --> 00:00:14,370
They are not intended to urge or promote any behavior in the series.

4
00:00:14,400 --> 00:00:16,900
Viewer discretion is advised.

5
00:00:20,150 --> 00:00:21,220
This is heartwarming.

6
00:00:22,810 --> 00:00:24,460
This is really family.

7
00:00:25,030 --> 00:00:27,450
I hope Jett’ll accept and understand,

8
00:00:27,840 --> 00:00:31,660
so the conflict between humans and vampires can finally end.

9
00:00:32,040 --> 00:00:34,350
That depends on the wheel of fate.

10
00:00:45,250 --> 00:00:45,890
Father!

11
00:01:08,710 --> 00:01:09,550
Jett.

12
00:01:09,960 --> 00:01:10,390
Yes?

13
00:01:11,110 --> 00:01:12,300
Come pray in my room.

14
00:01:13,620 --> 00:01:14,150
Okay.

15
00:01:24,510 --> 00:01:25,420
Don’t go!

16
00:01:33,180 --> 00:01:35,020
Stop! I’m telling you to stop!

17
00:01:35,330 --> 00:01:35,850
Stop!

18
00:01:43,630 --> 00:01:44,380
Jett.

19
00:03:42,840 --> 00:03:44,360
This is good, Punn.

20
00:03:47,550 --> 00:03:49,440
Good job peeling the onions and garlic.

21
00:03:55,180 --> 00:03:56,670
You cut the carrots perfectly.

22
00:04:02,180 --> 00:04:03,300
Well done, both of you.

23
00:04:25,020 --> 00:04:26,050
Hey, what’s going on?

24
00:04:26,090 --> 00:04:27,020
Are you hurt?

25
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:32,700
Okay, we’ll handle that.

26
00:04:32,740 --> 00:04:34,490
Where are you? I’ll come right away.

27
00:04:36,380 --> 00:04:37,580
What’s happening?

28
00:04:38,360 --> 00:04:40,220
Something’s wrong with Jett and Elise,
isn’t it?

29
00:04:43,860 --> 00:04:45,140
I’m not sure yet.

30
00:04:45,740 --> 00:04:48,780
I’ll let you know as soon as I find out.

31
00:04:54,290 --> 00:04:55,180
Let me come with you.

32
00:04:55,200 --> 00:04:56,380
You just recovered.

33
00:04:56,840 --> 00:04:58,950
Stay here. Don’t go looking for trouble.

34
00:04:59,240 --> 00:05:00,420
I don’t want to have to heal you again.

35
00:05:01,340 --> 00:05:02,080
Come on!

36
00:05:13,510 --> 00:05:16,090
How is she? Is she badly injured?

37
00:05:16,700 --> 00:05:18,240
It sounds like it from her voice.

38
00:05:20,790 --> 00:05:23,180
The point is, it happened at the hospital.

39
00:05:23,220 --> 00:05:25,530
Can you coordinate getting
the emergency room ready, just in case?

40
00:05:25,560 --> 00:05:27,010
The emergency room?

41
00:05:27,940 --> 00:05:29,440
This must be serious.

42
00:05:44,030 --> 00:05:45,130
Ms. Elise!

43
00:05:48,460 --> 00:05:51,040
Hang in there. Mekhin is on his way.

44
00:05:51,070 --> 00:05:52,170
He can help you.

45
00:05:52,580 --> 00:05:53,980
Jett has a weapon.

46
00:05:55,170 --> 00:05:56,610
What weapon?

47
00:05:57,420 --> 00:06:03,170
The one that can stop Ramil
from using his powers.

48
00:06:08,380 --> 00:06:09,250
Are you alright?

49
00:06:17,570 --> 00:06:20,380
(Please tell Mr. Punn not to worry.)

50
00:06:20,400 --> 00:06:24,220
(I asked Mekhin to heal Ms. Elise
with his power. She’s safe now.)

51
00:06:24,250 --> 00:06:27,580
(Please just find Feratu.
He’s taken over Mr. Jett’s body.)

52
00:06:29,980 --> 00:06:31,320
Let me help with that.

53
00:07:08,070 --> 00:07:09,150
How’s it going?

54
00:07:09,380 --> 00:07:10,740
I found Jett.

55
00:07:12,010 --> 00:07:12,910
Where is he?

56
00:07:14,850 --> 00:07:16,450
He’s at the Hunters’ secret base.

57
00:07:49,460 --> 00:07:50,370
Mr. Ramil.

58
00:07:53,840 --> 00:07:55,530
How are you going to help Jett?

59
00:07:55,950 --> 00:07:58,940
If Feratu’s controlling his mind and body,

60
00:08:00,160 --> 00:08:01,960
I’ll probably have to do what I did last time.

61
00:08:02,770 --> 00:08:05,170
If you’re using your power
to enter Jett’s mind,

62
00:08:08,200 --> 00:08:09,430
can I go with you?

63
00:08:09,970 --> 00:08:11,860
I’ve never taken anyone with me before.

64
00:08:12,750 --> 00:08:13,930
It’s very dangerous.

65
00:08:15,090 --> 00:08:16,900
If you get separated from me,

66
00:08:17,970 --> 00:08:19,550
you won’t be able to get out.

67
00:08:22,630 --> 00:08:24,580
Jett is like family to me.

68
00:08:26,580 --> 00:08:30,200
No matter how risky it is, I’ll bring him back.

69
00:08:35,860 --> 00:08:36,809
Alright, let’s go.

70
00:09:04,420 --> 00:09:07,180
Don’t worry, Punn. Jett will be alright.

71
00:09:07,700 --> 00:09:08,940
We’ll save him.

72
00:09:11,100 --> 00:09:12,150
Let’s go inside.

73
00:09:24,480 --> 00:09:26,570
Give back Jett’s body, Feratu!

74
00:09:34,260 --> 00:09:35,950
It’s been hundreds of years.

75
00:09:37,820 --> 00:09:40,400
Aren’t you going to greet your little brother?

76
00:09:41,480 --> 00:09:44,870
You two came rushing in like
someone’s about to die.

77
00:09:46,580 --> 00:09:47,190
Wait,

78
00:09:50,060 --> 00:09:51,890
is someone really going to die today?

79
00:09:54,460 --> 00:09:55,520
What happened to Jett?

80
00:09:56,620 --> 00:09:57,740
What did you do to him?

81
00:10:02,830 --> 00:10:03,580
I don’t know.

82
00:10:06,540 --> 00:10:08,670
My body doesn’t work anymore,

83
00:10:11,870 --> 00:10:13,430
so I’m using this one instead.

84
00:10:14,380 --> 00:10:14,960
Punn!

85
00:10:15,240 --> 00:10:15,700
Punn!

86
00:10:27,020 --> 00:10:29,220
Or would you rather let me use your body?

87
00:10:29,540 --> 00:10:30,140
Punn.

88
00:10:32,250 --> 00:10:33,150
Why?

89
00:10:34,360 --> 00:10:37,640
Don’t you remember
who took care of all of you?

90
00:10:44,230 --> 00:10:46,920
This body responds very well to my power,

91
00:10:48,260 --> 00:10:49,170
don’t you think, Punn?

92
00:10:49,870 --> 00:10:51,340
That’s enough, Feratu!

93
00:10:58,880 --> 00:11:00,330
I told you before that

94
00:11:00,620 --> 00:11:04,630
if you didn’t kill me, I’d be back to kill you.

95
00:11:07,880 --> 00:11:09,560
I’m going to kill your heart.

96
00:11:27,680 --> 00:11:29,070
If you dare to shoot your friend,

97
00:11:30,420 --> 00:11:31,460
then do it!

98
00:11:32,360 --> 00:11:33,430
Shoot him, Punn!

99
00:11:33,810 --> 00:11:37,090
He’s not your friend anymore! He’s Feratu!

100
00:11:37,390 --> 00:11:38,740
He’s a demon!

101
00:11:38,770 --> 00:11:39,430
Do it, Punn.

102
00:11:39,460 --> 00:11:40,320
Shoot!

103
00:11:40,350 --> 00:11:41,320
He’s a demon!

104
00:11:41,990 --> 00:11:42,740
Shut up!

105
00:11:45,220 --> 00:11:45,900
Punn!

106
00:11:47,030 --> 00:11:48,880
You talk too much.

107
00:11:48,910 --> 00:11:50,700
Now die like your pets!

108
00:11:56,900 --> 00:11:57,590
Ciar!

109
00:11:57,900 --> 00:11:58,690
Ciar!

110
00:11:58,960 --> 00:11:59,690
Ciar!

111
00:12:00,270 --> 00:12:00,760
Ciar!

112
00:12:02,040 --> 00:12:02,730
Ciar!

113
00:12:02,760 --> 00:12:03,570
Ciar!

114
00:12:05,290 --> 00:12:06,260
How are you?

115
00:12:09,310 --> 00:12:10,300
Where’s Jett?

116
00:12:10,940 --> 00:12:12,130
He went inside.

117
00:12:16,520 --> 00:12:17,020
Punn,

118
00:12:17,650 --> 00:12:18,740
wait here.

119
00:12:19,180 --> 00:12:20,040
Let me go in alone.

120
00:12:21,380 --> 00:12:22,750
I’m coming with you.

121
00:12:24,490 --> 00:12:26,900
My brother is very dangerous.

122
00:12:27,610 --> 00:12:29,020
Jett is my friend.

123
00:12:29,780 --> 00:12:31,180
I have to save him.

124
00:12:47,990 --> 00:12:49,500
Take care of Ciar, Mekhin.

125
00:12:50,900 --> 00:12:51,890
I’m coming too.

126
00:13:11,810 --> 00:13:12,220
Punn.

127
00:13:20,850 --> 00:13:21,740
I’m here.

128
00:13:29,520 --> 00:13:31,030
Stop causing trouble already.

129
00:13:31,280 --> 00:13:32,710
Give back Jett’s body!

130
00:13:33,580 --> 00:13:34,100
Or else, I’ll—

131
00:13:34,130 --> 00:13:35,460
Spare my life like you did last time?

132
00:13:37,850 --> 00:13:39,170
I want to end this so badly.

133
00:13:40,380 --> 00:13:42,380
I want to end this so badly.

134
00:13:43,570 --> 00:13:45,570
But if you want to do it the same way as before,

135
00:13:48,750 --> 00:13:50,380
try using your power to order me.

136
00:13:54,780 --> 00:13:56,780
I don’t want to use my power on you.

137
00:13:57,160 --> 00:13:59,460
I hope you get what I’m saying.

138
00:14:02,630 --> 00:14:05,130
I’m not Jonoel’s only heir like you are.

139
00:14:07,980 --> 00:14:09,340
I’m not as smart as you.

140
00:14:32,860 --> 00:14:33,580
How is this possible?

141
00:14:40,940 --> 00:14:42,590
How are we going to save Jett now?

142
00:14:42,620 --> 00:14:45,490
We can’t use your power to control him either. It’s Jett’s body.

143
00:14:45,730 --> 00:14:46,540
Mr. Ramil!

144
00:14:50,220 --> 00:14:51,590
You can’t do anything to me.

145
00:15:00,060 --> 00:15:00,740
Mr. Ramil!

146
00:15:22,820 --> 00:15:25,040
I talked to Paul and Caster.

147
00:15:25,070 --> 00:15:29,980
They said the headpiece is what’s
stopping you from controlling his mind.

148
00:15:31,290 --> 00:15:33,610
We need to remove it first.

149
00:15:34,900 --> 00:15:36,190
So you guys figured it out, huh?

150
00:15:37,050 --> 00:15:38,820
If you want to take this thing off my head,

151
00:15:39,820 --> 00:15:40,840
then come and try.

152
00:15:43,460 --> 00:15:47,630
I beg you. Please don’t do this.

153
00:15:48,140 --> 00:15:49,180
You’re begging me?

154
00:15:51,420 --> 00:15:57,070
Then give your life in exchange
for this headpiece.

155
00:16:04,990 --> 00:16:05,620
(Ciar.)

156
00:16:08,760 --> 00:16:11,550
If you hurt any more of my friends again,

157
00:16:11,580 --> 00:16:14,970
even hell won’t have a place for you, Feratu!

158
00:16:40,120 --> 00:16:41,700
If talking won’t work,

159
00:16:43,020 --> 00:16:44,530
then I guess I’ll have to show you.

160
00:16:45,400 --> 00:16:46,140
Jett!

161
00:16:47,410 --> 00:16:47,760
Jett!

162
00:16:49,950 --> 00:16:50,440
Jett!

163
00:16:50,470 --> 00:16:51,190
Feratu!

164
00:16:51,860 --> 00:16:52,790
Jett!

165
00:16:53,130 --> 00:16:53,470
Jett!

166
00:16:53,780 --> 00:16:54,230
Jett!

167
00:17:01,980 --> 00:17:02,830
Jett!

168
00:17:03,470 --> 00:17:04,300
Mr. Ramil!

169
00:17:08,390 --> 00:17:10,069
You’ll never be able to save him.

170
00:17:10,690 --> 00:17:13,180
This body will be mine forever!

171
00:17:17,480 --> 00:17:18,150
Let go!

172
00:17:19,410 --> 00:17:20,079
Let go!

173
00:17:21,380 --> 00:17:22,079
Let go!

174
00:17:26,210 --> 00:17:26,970
Let go!

175
00:17:28,020 --> 00:17:28,780
Let go!

176
00:17:31,120 --> 00:17:31,790
Punn.

177
00:17:32,700 --> 00:17:33,920
Don’t worry, Elise.

178
00:17:34,400 --> 00:17:35,890
I’ll bring Jett back.

179
00:17:36,580 --> 00:17:38,580
You must come back to me too.

180
00:17:44,850 --> 00:17:45,560
Hey.

181
00:17:56,700 --> 00:17:57,580
Feratu!

182
00:17:58,800 --> 00:17:59,490
Jett!

183
00:18:05,360 --> 00:18:05,990
Jett!

184
00:18:06,650 --> 00:18:07,190
Jett!

185
00:18:11,790 --> 00:18:12,640
Punn!

186
00:18:16,020 --> 00:18:17,260
Stop it, Feratu!

187
00:18:21,810 --> 00:18:25,170
If I survive, I’ll hunt that boy of yours down.

188
00:18:26,660 --> 00:18:28,660
There won’t be a next time, Feratu.

189
00:18:41,240 --> 00:18:41,780
Jett!

190
00:18:42,240 --> 00:18:43,020
Jett!

191
00:18:44,180 --> 00:18:44,760
Jett!

192
00:18:45,360 --> 00:18:46,550
Wake up, Jett!

193
00:19:03,440 --> 00:19:06,920
May the three of us grow up together.

194
00:19:08,140 --> 00:19:10,780
May we stay together forever.

195
00:19:11,400 --> 00:19:14,380
What if we get adopted
and have to live in different homes?

196
00:19:15,190 --> 00:19:18,370
So what? We’ll still be friends.

197
00:19:18,410 --> 00:19:21,550
No, what are we? We talked about this.

198
00:19:23,080 --> 00:19:23,980
Family.

199
00:19:24,580 --> 00:19:26,580
We’ll be family forever.

200
00:19:29,430 --> 00:19:30,860
Jett, wake up!

201
00:19:31,190 --> 00:19:32,080
Jett!

202
00:19:32,110 --> 00:19:32,650
Jett!

203
00:19:32,900 --> 00:19:33,870
Jett!

204
00:19:34,650 --> 00:19:36,380
We’re all we have, Jett!

205
00:19:38,160 --> 00:19:38,920
Jett.

206
00:19:43,780 --> 00:19:45,580
Come back, Jett.

207
00:19:45,620 --> 00:19:47,960
Come back to us. Let’s be family forever.

208
00:20:21,410 --> 00:20:23,400
Please take care of everyone, Methus.

209
00:20:23,450 --> 00:20:24,780
I will, Master.

210
00:20:33,090 --> 00:20:35,090
It’s finally over, Punn.

211
00:20:36,890 --> 00:20:40,770
I don’t know how I would’ve made it through
without you.

212
00:20:44,980 --> 00:20:48,690
Thank you for staying by my side.

213
00:20:50,860 --> 00:20:54,650
No, I should be the one thanking you.

214
00:20:55,380 --> 00:20:58,140
We all survived because of you.

215
00:20:59,400 --> 00:21:02,250
Thank you for staying with me.

216
00:21:06,780 --> 00:21:11,070
Then can I stay with you forever?

217
00:21:11,860 --> 00:21:13,150
I’m not going anywhere.

218
00:21:20,560 --> 00:21:22,140
Even if you run away from me,

219
00:21:23,580 --> 00:21:25,580
I’ll still look for you.

220
00:22:18,120 --> 00:22:19,180
Master?

221
00:22:20,300 --> 00:22:21,580
I’ve thought it through.

222
00:22:22,130 --> 00:22:28,140
I never wanted the title of vampire leader
or the hotel in the first place.

223
00:22:29,240 --> 00:22:30,390
I’m giving them to you.

224
00:22:31,660 --> 00:22:34,010
But I may not be suitable.

225
00:22:34,050 --> 00:22:35,630
I chose the right person, Methus.

226
00:22:36,200 --> 00:22:37,980
You deserve it the most.

227
00:22:39,260 --> 00:22:42,970
You’ve been with me through almost
every stage of my life.

228
00:22:45,160 --> 00:22:51,220
Thank you for being my most trusted
and capable brother.

229
00:22:54,200 --> 00:22:56,200
I’ll take good care of this place,

230
00:22:56,750 --> 00:22:58,770
whether you come back or not.

231
00:23:01,620 --> 00:23:03,420
And as the vampire leader,

232
00:23:07,290 --> 00:23:12,980
I’ll set all vampires free to live their own lives,

233
00:23:14,320 --> 00:23:16,320
no longer under any family’s power.

234
00:23:18,870 --> 00:23:20,600
I knew I’d chosen the right person.

235
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:29,940
From now on, both vampires and humans
will finally be free to live their own lives.

236
00:23:39,820 --> 00:23:45,120
What do you guys think we should do
now that there are no more Hunters?

237
00:23:46,880 --> 00:23:48,400
Hmm…

238
00:23:49,410 --> 00:23:52,750
I guess we’ll go our separate ways
and live our own lives.

239
00:23:53,040 --> 00:23:56,390
Only you can stay with the vampires.

240
00:23:58,830 --> 00:24:00,480
This one?

241
00:24:01,070 --> 00:24:02,100
Mm-hmm.

242
00:24:03,350 --> 00:24:03,950
Here.

243
00:24:05,120 --> 00:24:07,990
Don’t tell me this is Ramil.

244
00:24:08,450 --> 00:24:09,580
No.

245
00:24:09,610 --> 00:24:11,250
Hey!

246
00:24:11,290 --> 00:24:12,740
He’s smiling. See?

247
00:24:13,910 --> 00:24:15,270
Take it back.

248
00:24:15,300 --> 00:24:18,650
The Hunters were just a group we imagined.

249
00:24:20,130 --> 00:24:25,180
Without them, we’re just ordinary humans again,

250
00:24:26,370 --> 00:24:28,780
with dreams, goals,

251
00:24:29,420 --> 00:24:30,680
and our own journeys.

252
00:24:32,250 --> 00:24:36,890
Wow, you really sound like you’re going to
join the priesthood.

253
00:24:37,190 --> 00:24:40,540
Hey, Jett is preparing to become a brother.

254
00:24:41,960 --> 00:24:43,960
I don’t know. I’m so old already.

255
00:24:44,380 --> 00:24:47,860
But I’ll help out at the orphanage anyway.

256
00:24:48,420 --> 00:24:50,420
Or maybe you can take over Punn’s shop.

257
00:24:51,570 --> 00:24:53,780
No, I’ll give it to Pokpong.

258
00:25:08,740 --> 00:25:10,470
Wow!

259
00:25:11,660 --> 00:25:12,800
Your throat doesn’t look so red
anymore.

260
00:25:12,820 --> 00:25:14,000
This means you listened to me

261
00:25:14,300 --> 00:25:15,760
and didn’t drink cold water.

262
00:25:18,160 --> 00:25:19,360
- Well done.
- Doctor.

263
00:25:19,390 --> 00:25:19,960
Hmm?

264
00:25:21,150 --> 00:25:22,940
Can I have snacks now?

265
00:25:24,030 --> 00:25:26,360
You’re worried about snacks again.

266
00:25:27,290 --> 00:25:29,110
Please.

267
00:25:32,200 --> 00:25:33,070
I’ll buy some for you.

268
00:25:33,380 --> 00:25:34,420
Yay!

269
00:25:35,610 --> 00:25:36,720
What do you want to eat?

270
00:25:36,740 --> 00:25:38,160
How about jelly candy? I have some.

271
00:25:44,160 --> 00:25:45,170
Hey, Doctor.

272
00:25:46,090 --> 00:25:49,270
Hey. You’re studying at work these days?

273
00:25:49,730 --> 00:25:53,060
It’s so hard. I don’t know if I’ll survive
going back to school.

274
00:25:58,270 --> 00:25:59,250
Let me see.

275
00:26:02,110 --> 00:26:04,760
Maybe you substituted the values incorrectly.

276
00:26:05,560 --> 00:26:08,550
Look here. What should x actually be?

277
00:26:08,920 --> 00:26:09,980
It should be 2.

278
00:26:12,400 --> 00:26:13,050
How?

279
00:26:13,080 --> 00:26:21,220
Look. The question says x = 1 − 1 + 4.

280
00:26:21,740 --> 00:26:26,860
When you plug that in,
you get ½ + (√3 / 2) × i.

281
00:26:27,460 --> 00:26:29,500
Now you have the value for set 1.

282
00:26:29,530 --> 00:26:32,380
Next, find the value of set 2, okay?

283
00:26:33,660 --> 00:26:36,390
Take equation 1 and apply it to equation 2.

284
00:26:36,670 --> 00:26:41,430
The theme for our gallery this month
is the moon.

285
00:26:41,460 --> 00:26:42,580
This way, please.

286
00:26:50,070 --> 00:26:52,070
As the new owner of the pub,

287
00:26:52,540 --> 00:26:58,450
I’m not letting anyone go home sober! Hey!

288
00:26:58,470 --> 00:27:00,180
Cheers!

289
00:27:00,910 --> 00:27:08,620
Guys, I assure you no one else in the
anti-aging industry is using this extract.

290
00:27:08,910 --> 00:27:10,550
Do you know what this is?

291
00:27:10,570 --> 00:27:11,980
CROW, DOCTOR, PUNN’S BOYFRIEND

292
00:27:12,020 --> 00:27:13,950
This is the vampire serum.

293
00:27:13,990 --> 00:27:16,880
And do you know why it’s called
the vampire serum?

294
00:27:16,910 --> 00:27:21,020
Because it can make you look
10 years younger!

295
00:27:21,670 --> 00:27:24,270
Now, when I say “serum of vampires,”

296
00:27:24,300 --> 00:27:26,270
I want everyone to shout “pires” at the end.

297
00:27:26,300 --> 00:27:27,370
I’ll start now.

298
00:27:27,390 --> 00:27:28,410
Serum of vam—

299
00:27:28,430 --> 00:27:29,040
Pires!

300
00:27:29,060 --> 00:27:29,770
Serum of vam—

301
00:27:29,790 --> 00:27:30,180
Pires!

302
00:27:30,200 --> 00:27:32,500
Wow, you’re all amazing!

303
00:27:32,540 --> 00:27:34,870
You won’t find anything like this
in another 100 years. Trust me.

304
00:27:34,900 --> 00:27:35,970
Isn’t it interesting?

305
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:36,770
Isn’t it interesting?

306
00:27:44,140 --> 00:27:48,660
Who’s going to take care of these roses
from now on?

307
00:27:49,560 --> 00:27:50,610
Mr. Methus?

308
00:27:52,320 --> 00:27:53,010
Yeah.

309
00:27:54,180 --> 00:27:57,950
Mr. Methus can take care of these roses?

310
00:28:01,460 --> 00:28:05,480
He has to. I won’t let them wilt.

311
00:28:05,500 --> 00:28:06,810
We’ve been growing them for so long.

312
00:28:11,380 --> 00:28:17,960
I can’t believe it. Everyone says
these roses are hard to take care of,

313
00:28:18,510 --> 00:28:20,340
but they’ve survived until now.

314
00:28:24,940 --> 00:28:27,430
Nothing is too hard if you try.

315
00:28:29,430 --> 00:28:32,690
You sound like a life coach.

316
00:28:34,020 --> 00:28:37,190
What’s a life coach?

317
00:28:38,300 --> 00:28:44,380
Someone who gives advice about life.

318
00:28:48,960 --> 00:28:53,120
Does that mean I’m a life coach
for these roses?

319
00:28:55,020 --> 00:28:56,340
No, Mr. Ramil.

320
00:28:56,370 --> 00:28:57,030
Oh?

321
00:28:57,580 --> 00:29:00,430
A life coach advises humans.

322
00:29:03,860 --> 00:29:06,700
What if I want a word to use with the roses?

323
00:29:15,300 --> 00:29:16,610
How about “Daddy”?

324
00:29:20,300 --> 00:29:22,020
You can be the daddy of these roses.

325
00:29:25,440 --> 00:29:28,100
Humans love using weird words, huh?

326
00:29:34,080 --> 00:29:35,380
Your Mommy’s giving you a shower.

327
00:29:35,410 --> 00:29:36,660
How are you feeling, babies?

328
00:29:37,280 --> 00:29:39,040
What are you talking about?

329
00:29:39,850 --> 00:29:43,580
Well, didn’t you say I’m their Daddy?

330
00:29:45,160 --> 00:29:47,160
Mommy, spray more water on our babies.

331
00:29:47,470 --> 00:29:48,660
They need it.

332
00:29:49,050 --> 00:29:52,560
Not Mommy. I’m their Papa.

333
00:29:53,710 --> 00:29:55,150
Alright, Papa.

334
00:29:55,850 --> 00:29:56,780
You do the spraying.

335
00:29:57,890 --> 00:29:59,690
Got it, Papa.

336
00:30:04,490 --> 00:30:05,710
Spray here too.

337
00:30:12,310 --> 00:30:15,580
Don’t forget to water them
and avoid harsh sunlight.

338
00:30:15,980 --> 00:30:19,500
I’ve already separated the ones that need
extra fertilizer,

339
00:30:19,530 --> 00:30:20,740
so remember to add it.

340
00:30:22,390 --> 00:30:23,760
Got it, Master.

341
00:30:26,260 --> 00:30:27,750
What are you guys talking about?

342
00:30:30,320 --> 00:30:31,980
Pong, we’ve talked about this.

343
00:30:32,010 --> 00:30:33,400
Why are you being fussy now?

344
00:30:33,640 --> 00:30:35,170
Come on, Punn.

345
00:30:35,580 --> 00:30:37,100
How am I supposed to feel?

346
00:30:37,130 --> 00:30:39,100
Happy that you’re moving away?

347
00:30:39,420 --> 00:30:40,720
If it were somewhere I could follow you,

348
00:30:40,750 --> 00:30:41,620
I wouldn’t be complaining.

349
00:30:42,770 --> 00:30:43,690
Come here.

350
00:30:43,740 --> 00:30:44,390
Come on.

351
00:30:48,100 --> 00:30:49,860
Don’t forget me.

352
00:30:50,770 --> 00:30:53,990
How could I forget you? You’re my brother.

353
00:31:01,260 --> 00:31:07,660
By the way, Punn, will you really not age
if you stay there?

354
00:31:07,700 --> 00:31:09,110
Will you be this young forever?

355
00:31:09,480 --> 00:31:12,450
Yes. There’s no time there.

356
00:31:12,490 --> 00:31:14,380
Everything pauses in the present.

357
00:31:16,600 --> 00:31:20,430
I’m happy anywhere you’re happy.

358
00:31:24,740 --> 00:31:26,130
I’ll come visit, brother.

359
00:31:26,580 --> 00:31:27,320
Okay.

360
00:31:53,820 --> 00:31:55,460
Are you sure about this, Punn?

361
00:31:57,060 --> 00:31:57,980
Yes, I am.

362
00:31:58,800 --> 00:32:02,020
Like I said, I want to be with you forever.

363
00:32:12,970 --> 00:32:14,380
Then come live with me.

364
00:32:15,230 --> 00:32:16,540
Forever.
