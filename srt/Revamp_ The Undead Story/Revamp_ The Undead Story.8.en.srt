are fictional and created for entertainment purposes only.

They are not intended to urge or promote any behavior in the series.

4
00:00:14,400 --> 00:00:16,930
Viewer discretion is advised.

5
00:00:16,950 --> 00:00:18,580
Can I join the Hunters?

6
00:00:19,310 --> 00:00:21,070
Just let me help rescue him, that’s all I ask.

7
00:00:21,120 --> 00:00:23,440
I went to find clues about the Hunters.

8
00:00:25,760 --> 00:00:27,610
How do you guys know about Father?

9
00:00:27,640 --> 00:00:30,580
Feratu, my younger half-brother from a different mother.

10
00:00:30,610 --> 00:00:36,500
I think he’s Father Dracul, the owner of the orphanage where you lived.

11
00:00:38,860 --> 00:00:41,180
I’m your brother, Ramil.

12
00:00:41,570 --> 00:00:43,160
You’re not allowed to do this to me.

13
00:00:44,220 --> 00:00:46,960
You killed a senior vampire on the council.

14
00:00:46,980 --> 00:00:48,420
Was that allowed?

15
00:00:48,460 --> 00:00:50,940
Master Ramil is the rightful heir
to the previous leader.

16
00:00:51,740 --> 00:00:54,480
He should be the next leader of Jonoel.

17
00:00:54,500 --> 00:00:56,980
This is none of your business, you servant!

18
00:00:57,800 --> 00:01:02,070
I take care of this family. Whoever is plotting
or rebelling against Master

19
00:01:02,090 --> 00:01:03,560
is my business.

20
00:01:06,120 --> 00:01:09,640
If you don’t want the title of leader,
give it to me.

21
00:01:10,160 --> 00:01:11,500
It’s not difficult.

22
00:01:14,070 --> 00:01:16,070
It’s not that easy, Feratu.

23
00:01:17,410 --> 00:01:19,110
We can’t just settle this between us.

24
00:01:19,600 --> 00:01:21,300
You say you’re not obsessed with power,

25
00:01:21,350 --> 00:01:24,520
but you want to rule Jonoel.

26
00:01:24,900 --> 00:01:29,050
I’m sure you made a wish to Satan
for our father to die quickly.

27
00:01:31,900 --> 00:01:34,500
I’ve always thought of you
as my real brother,

28
00:01:35,270 --> 00:01:37,740
even though we have different mothers.

29
00:01:38,820 --> 00:01:41,420
But because of your endless greed

30
00:01:41,950 --> 00:01:43,950
and the way you kill people
just for thinking differently,

31
00:01:44,570 --> 00:01:48,550
I’ve come to realize
you don’t deserve to be here,

32
00:01:50,430 --> 00:01:55,039
Still, for our father’s sake, I won’t kill you.

33
00:01:57,370 --> 00:01:58,880
But, Master…

34
00:02:01,560 --> 00:02:03,560
You’re banished from Greenmoore.

35
00:02:04,300 --> 00:02:05,340
Leave.

36
00:02:06,700 --> 00:02:07,870
And don’t ever come back.

37
00:02:13,680 --> 00:02:15,810
The kids drew this.

38
00:02:15,850 --> 00:02:19,880
I saw the scar on his neck
and it reminded me of Feratu.

39
00:02:20,660 --> 00:02:23,210
You lived there, Mr. Punn.

40
00:02:23,240 --> 00:02:25,750
Do you remember anything
about Father Dracul?

41
00:02:26,220 --> 00:02:27,460
I was very young.

42
00:02:28,300 --> 00:02:29,980
I could barely remember anything.

43
00:02:31,079 --> 00:02:36,780
I don’t even remember him having that scar.

44
00:04:19,690 --> 00:04:21,540
I think we have to deal with this right away.

45
00:04:21,579 --> 00:04:25,330
If Feratu really is behind
the Hunters’ vengeance, that’s bad.

46
00:04:25,700 --> 00:04:30,030
We need to confirm as soon as possible
if the priest at the orphanage is really him.

47
00:04:30,060 --> 00:04:33,180
Punn said he only has a faint memory
of the priest.

48
00:04:33,200 --> 00:04:37,380
Besides, he doesn’t know
what Feratu looks like.

49
00:04:38,020 --> 00:04:39,980
We probably can’t get an answer from him.

50
00:04:40,420 --> 00:04:41,990
There’s another way

51
00:04:42,770 --> 00:04:45,370
you can see what that priest looks like

52
00:04:45,390 --> 00:04:46,860
and confirm it yourself.

53
00:04:50,510 --> 00:04:52,110
It’s too dangerous.

54
00:04:52,960 --> 00:04:55,700
And I don’t want to use that power on Punn.

55
00:04:58,320 --> 00:05:00,550
You’re down bad, Master.

56
00:05:02,680 --> 00:05:03,560
What do you mean?

57
00:05:04,210 --> 00:05:07,100
In human words, you’re smitten.

58
00:05:07,660 --> 00:05:09,420
You’ve been so smitten lately.

59
00:05:19,600 --> 00:05:21,020
What are you talking about?

60
00:05:21,050 --> 00:05:22,480
I’ve never been like that!

61
00:05:23,110 --> 00:05:24,100
Methus!

62
00:05:30,390 --> 00:05:32,390
Thank you for agreeing to meet me.

63
00:05:35,060 --> 00:05:40,650
If you want to find a way to end the conflict,
then we share the same goal.

64
00:05:42,790 --> 00:05:44,650
I went to the orphanage.

65
00:05:48,070 --> 00:05:49,740
The orphanage?

66
00:05:50,780 --> 00:05:52,290
Where you all lived.

67
00:05:58,360 --> 00:06:00,040
Father Dracul?

68
00:06:01,160 --> 00:06:03,710
Do you know that he’s still alive?

69
00:06:06,380 --> 00:06:07,700
That’s impossible.

70
00:06:08,070 --> 00:06:12,160
The three of us
were the only survivors that day.

71
00:06:13,680 --> 00:06:15,380
But he’s still alive.

72
00:06:20,110 --> 00:06:22,110
If Father really were alive,

73
00:06:23,550 --> 00:06:25,060
then Jett would know about it.

74
00:06:26,630 --> 00:06:28,220
You think so too, right?

75
00:06:28,880 --> 00:06:30,670
Jett would definitely know.

76
00:06:31,540 --> 00:06:34,100
There’s more to Father Dracul’s story.

77
00:06:34,659 --> 00:06:38,890
If he’s alive, I’m afraid this won’t end well.

78
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:45,030
Can you please help me investigate?

79
00:06:54,220 --> 00:06:56,980
Why didn’t he choose a parrot, a flamingo,

80
00:06:57,430 --> 00:06:59,740
or some other cute bird?

81
00:07:00,320 --> 00:07:03,030
He chose crows. So creepy!

82
00:07:23,890 --> 00:07:27,370
Are you here to check if I’m dead?

83
00:07:30,630 --> 00:07:32,190
What are you planning to do?

84
00:07:32,220 --> 00:07:35,240
Form a vampire army to attack the Hunters?

85
00:07:35,280 --> 00:07:38,340
You guessed it. Why even ask?

86
00:07:38,780 --> 00:07:42,140
To make you reconsider
and change your mind.

87
00:07:42,940 --> 00:07:44,220
Please stop, Ciar.

88
00:07:44,250 --> 00:07:46,020
It’s not worth getting people hurt or killed.

89
00:07:46,050 --> 00:07:48,870
Are you just going to let humans
kill us so easily?

90
00:07:48,900 --> 00:07:50,409
I’m not a coward like your Master.

91
00:07:50,430 --> 00:07:51,260
Ciar!

92
00:07:53,990 --> 00:07:55,659
At least go see Master.

93
00:07:55,700 --> 00:07:58,960
Do whatever you want, but don’t do it alone.

94
00:08:00,460 --> 00:08:03,970
You know that Master never trusted me.

95
00:08:04,420 --> 00:08:05,980
Why do you want me to go back?

96
00:08:06,990 --> 00:08:08,840
Does he even know I disappeared?

97
00:08:08,870 --> 00:08:09,580
He does.

98
00:08:10,580 --> 00:08:13,480
He’s worried about you and so am I.

99
00:08:13,500 --> 00:08:15,230
Everyone’s worried about you.

100
00:08:18,810 --> 00:08:21,770
Please stop. I’m begging you.

101
00:08:25,560 --> 00:08:27,460
If you don’t want to join me,
then don’t get in my way.

102
00:08:28,230 --> 00:08:29,560
Worry about yourself.

103
00:08:30,710 --> 00:08:32,960
Do you even realize you’ve been fooled
by that kid from the minimart?

104
00:08:35,530 --> 00:08:36,309
Who?

105
00:08:37,380 --> 00:08:38,580
Pokpong?

106
00:08:38,870 --> 00:08:40,429
I don’t know his name.

107
00:08:40,980 --> 00:08:45,330
But my sources told me he’s been
at the Hunters’ secret base lately.

108
00:08:46,010 --> 00:08:47,480
You might want to expect the worst.

109
00:08:48,240 --> 00:08:50,240
I told you humans can’t be trusted.

110
00:08:50,820 --> 00:08:52,370
Especially that family.

111
00:08:54,590 --> 00:08:56,420
Both brothers are good liars.

112
00:09:14,260 --> 00:09:17,940
You don’t have to keep trying to remember
anymore. It’s only going to stress you out.

113
00:09:17,970 --> 00:09:20,290
But if Father is really your brother,

114
00:09:21,480 --> 00:09:24,320
we should find out more as soon as possible.

115
00:09:24,500 --> 00:09:27,660
But now, you need to eat.

116
00:09:28,260 --> 00:09:30,340
Let’s look for information on Feratu later.

117
00:09:47,020 --> 00:09:47,740
Here.

118
00:09:49,110 --> 00:09:50,820
Nom!

119
00:09:51,640 --> 00:09:52,660
Nom, nom!

120
00:09:52,680 --> 00:09:53,580
Come on.

121
00:09:58,620 --> 00:09:59,590
Is it good?

122
00:10:01,180 --> 00:10:01,820
Yeah.

123
00:10:07,940 --> 00:10:09,820
You seem even more stressed than I am.

124
00:10:12,100 --> 00:10:13,900
I know you’re stressed too.

125
00:10:15,380 --> 00:10:18,320
How do you know? Can you read my mind?

126
00:10:21,450 --> 00:10:24,700
Of course. I can read your mind.

127
00:10:25,220 --> 00:10:27,220
Hmm…

128
00:10:28,420 --> 00:10:33,860
Then…what am I thinking right now?

129
00:10:51,540 --> 00:10:53,980
You want to win a doll
from the claw machine, right?

130
00:10:54,440 --> 00:10:55,740
How do you know?

131
00:10:57,280 --> 00:11:00,580
Of course, I do. I can read your mind.

132
00:11:06,790 --> 00:11:07,870
Wait a minute.

133
00:11:11,700 --> 00:11:13,090
You can read my mind.

134
00:11:13,340 --> 00:11:17,610
Why don’t you use that power
to see if Father is really Feratu?

135
00:11:25,510 --> 00:11:31,090
I can use my power to control people’s
minds, but I can’t see their past memories.

136
00:11:36,990 --> 00:11:39,120
But if you can enter people’s minds,

137
00:11:39,140 --> 00:11:40,660
then you should be able to see everything.

138
00:11:47,600 --> 00:11:48,910
Don’t you trust me?

139
00:11:49,880 --> 00:11:51,230
It’s not that I don’t trust you.

140
00:11:52,690 --> 00:11:54,930
I just want to end this as soon as possible.

141
00:11:55,270 --> 00:11:56,350
I understand.

142
00:11:57,910 --> 00:12:01,620
I don’t want you or anyone else
to get in trouble because of this anymore.

143
00:12:04,310 --> 00:12:06,380
I’ll find a way to end it.

144
00:12:09,220 --> 00:12:10,180
Master.

145
00:12:15,590 --> 00:12:17,590
I don’t know what Ciar said,

146
00:12:19,780 --> 00:12:24,420
but all the vampires there are in on his plan.

147
00:12:25,100 --> 00:12:27,750
I tried to talk him out of it,
but he wouldn’t listen.

148
00:12:27,990 --> 00:12:30,450
I think we should do something.

149
00:12:30,810 --> 00:12:35,400
I know, but if we talk to Ciar now,

150
00:12:35,420 --> 00:12:36,620
he’ll get even more out of control.

151
00:12:39,730 --> 00:12:43,130
Let’s wait for Methus to come back
and discuss this again.

152
00:12:47,240 --> 00:12:49,080
But besides Ciar’s plan,

153
00:12:55,080 --> 00:12:56,460
there’s something else.

154
00:12:58,720 --> 00:13:02,830
Pokpong has joined the Hunters.

155
00:13:07,090 --> 00:13:07,780
Punn.

156
00:13:31,560 --> 00:13:36,380
(Sorry, it’s not possible to reach the number
you’ve dialed at this moment.)

157
00:13:42,200 --> 00:13:45,580
WHEN WILL YOU COME HOME, PONG?

158
00:14:02,220 --> 00:14:06,640
I texted you that I came home
to find information on Father.

159
00:14:07,230 --> 00:14:09,370
There’s something else you should know.

160
00:14:10,070 --> 00:14:11,340
It’s about Pokpong, isn’t it?

161
00:14:17,340 --> 00:14:18,170
Hey!

162
00:14:18,660 --> 00:14:19,470
It’s that vampire!

163
00:14:19,500 --> 00:14:20,860
That vampire is here!

164
00:14:44,070 --> 00:14:46,250
Jett! Come out!

165
00:14:46,780 --> 00:14:47,490
Jett!

166
00:14:48,340 --> 00:14:48,930
Jett!

167
00:14:48,950 --> 00:14:50,940
What’s going on, Punn?

168
00:14:52,190 --> 00:14:53,860
Why did you bring him here?

169
00:14:54,100 --> 00:14:55,070
Where’s Jett?

170
00:14:56,020 --> 00:14:57,430
He’s not here.

171
00:14:57,440 --> 00:14:59,170
Why? What’s going on?

172
00:14:59,200 --> 00:15:02,710
Do you really have no idea
or are you just pretending, Elise?

173
00:15:02,740 --> 00:15:05,460
About what? Tell me!

174
00:15:06,060 --> 00:15:10,040
Jett recruited Pokpong to join the Hunters.

175
00:15:18,150 --> 00:15:19,440
The line got cut off.

176
00:15:19,460 --> 00:15:21,980
I can’t reach anyone, including Jett.

177
00:15:22,020 --> 00:15:23,650
I haven’t talked to him for a few days now.

178
00:15:24,650 --> 00:15:27,700
Are you sure Pokpong is really there?

179
00:15:27,720 --> 00:15:30,860
Paul always jokes,

180
00:15:30,880 --> 00:15:32,420
but from our conversation,

181
00:15:33,680 --> 00:15:37,620
I think Pokpong really has been sent for
training to become a hunter.

182
00:15:40,410 --> 00:15:45,600
I had no idea. If I’d known, I definitely
wouldn’t have let them take your brother.

183
00:15:46,260 --> 00:15:49,900
I know you’re not like that.

184
00:15:53,900 --> 00:15:57,440
I’m going to the base. I’m sure Jett is there.

185
00:15:58,870 --> 00:15:59,890
Let’s go now.

186
00:16:00,610 --> 00:16:01,590
Hold on.

187
00:16:01,940 --> 00:16:05,460
Won’t things get messy
if you go on your own?

188
00:16:06,310 --> 00:16:08,660
Not to mention the guest
you’re bringing along.

189
00:16:09,060 --> 00:16:13,530
I can’t just wait around for them to reach out.

190
00:16:13,900 --> 00:16:16,540
I’ll bring Pokpong back to you.

191
00:16:17,450 --> 00:16:18,900
Jett won’t let that happen.

192
00:16:18,940 --> 00:16:20,350
I won’t back down either.

193
00:16:21,660 --> 00:16:23,390
Your brother is like my brother.

194
00:16:53,260 --> 00:16:55,500
Doesn’t this thing make a sound?

195
00:16:55,870 --> 00:16:58,440
Once Elise contacts you, it’ll go off.

196
00:16:59,300 --> 00:17:00,810
You don’t have to hold it the whole time.

197
00:17:04,530 --> 00:17:05,990
Eat the steamed bun.

198
00:17:08,950 --> 00:17:11,540
You eat it. I’ve lost my appetite.

199
00:17:15,270 --> 00:17:18,060
I’ve already had two.

200
00:17:36,540 --> 00:17:38,300
Are you really close to Elise?

201
00:17:40,940 --> 00:17:41,810
Yeah.

202
00:17:42,660 --> 00:17:44,810
She’s like my real big sister.

203
00:17:47,440 --> 00:17:54,010
Then your real sister will definitely
bring your real brother back to you safely.

204
00:18:00,250 --> 00:18:02,100
Do you think Pokpong is mad at me?

205
00:18:02,980 --> 00:18:04,640
Because you’re a hunter?

206
00:18:05,400 --> 00:18:06,650
Why would he be mad at you?

207
00:18:08,560 --> 00:18:10,860
It’s not a normal person's job.

208
00:18:12,720 --> 00:18:15,250
Look at me. I’m not mad at Mekhin.

209
00:18:16,460 --> 00:18:20,820
A human doctor isn’t
a normal vampire’s job, either.

210
00:18:30,820 --> 00:18:33,110
Don’t worry about something
that hasn’t happened.

211
00:18:33,700 --> 00:18:35,700
Pokpong loves you so much.

212
00:18:36,980 --> 00:18:38,310
He’ll understand you.

213
00:18:51,500 --> 00:18:53,970
Our clan has been around
for hundreds of years.

214
00:18:54,800 --> 00:18:57,820
There’s no reason for us
to succumb to those vile humans.

215
00:18:59,220 --> 00:19:00,280
Tonight,

216
00:19:00,880 --> 00:19:02,880
we’ll show them

217
00:19:02,930 --> 00:19:05,140
not to mess with vampires again!

218
00:19:08,540 --> 00:19:09,770
It’s not too late to change your mind.

219
00:19:09,800 --> 00:19:10,780
You’re annoying.

220
00:19:11,660 --> 00:19:12,910
I’m trying to stop you
because I’m worried about you.

221
00:19:13,300 --> 00:19:14,780
I can’t just sit back and watch you do this.

222
00:19:16,500 --> 00:19:18,340
So you want me to sit back

223
00:19:18,370 --> 00:19:21,340
and watch those humans attack us again? Huh?

224
00:19:22,060 --> 00:19:23,220
I’m coming with you.

225
00:19:30,660 --> 00:19:31,810
If you’re coming, you have to hunt them.

226
00:19:32,480 --> 00:19:35,100
If I see you heal anyone
on the battlefield again,

227
00:19:36,430 --> 00:19:37,870
I’ll kill you.

228
00:19:48,390 --> 00:19:49,380
Not bad.

229
00:19:52,930 --> 00:19:54,350
Your training didn’t go to waste.

230
00:19:55,540 --> 00:19:59,490
You said I have to be ready for war
so I can save Punn, didn’t you?

231
00:20:00,010 --> 00:20:01,020
That’s right.

232
00:20:03,840 --> 00:20:05,360
What did they do to you?

233
00:20:06,800 --> 00:20:11,950
They hurt the people I love, just like
they’re hurting the person you love.

234
00:20:23,040 --> 00:20:24,030
Hello, sis.

235
00:20:25,590 --> 00:20:26,300
Yeah.

236
00:20:29,780 --> 00:20:32,540
We’re training right now, so it’s a bit loud.

237
00:20:32,580 --> 00:20:37,010
Did Jett really take Pokpong for
the Hunter training? Why didn’t you tell me?

238
00:20:40,030 --> 00:20:42,210
Who accidentally told you?

239
00:20:42,230 --> 00:20:45,980
Wait, don’t tell me it was Caster.

240
00:20:46,010 --> 00:20:50,300
He and I made a bet
on who’d let it slip to you first, you know?

241
00:20:50,320 --> 00:20:52,450
I’m going to remind him
he owes me omakase.

242
00:21:02,450 --> 00:21:04,730
Oh, shit!

243
00:21:06,500 --> 00:21:08,020
Hey, they’re here!

244
00:21:09,910 --> 00:21:10,980
Are you ready?

245
00:21:11,020 --> 00:21:12,790
It’s time for the real thing.

246
00:21:13,740 --> 00:21:18,300
Prove to me you’re strong enough
to protect your brother.

247
00:21:22,500 --> 00:21:23,860
Wait for them to come in,

248
00:21:28,860 --> 00:21:30,400
then deal with them.

249
00:21:34,700 --> 00:21:36,300
It’s time to hunt.

250
00:21:49,020 --> 00:21:49,970
Help!

251
00:21:51,140 --> 00:21:51,960
No!

252
00:21:53,120 --> 00:21:54,300
Don’t!

253
00:21:54,850 --> 00:21:55,780
Pokpong!

254
00:22:04,020 --> 00:22:04,850
Pokpong!

255
00:22:08,400 --> 00:22:09,350
Doctor.

256
00:22:10,590 --> 00:22:12,480
Let Pokpong go.

257
00:22:19,150 --> 00:22:20,180
He’s injured.

258
00:22:20,570 --> 00:22:22,450
I need to get him treated right away.

259
00:22:24,620 --> 00:22:25,790
Trust me.

260
00:22:34,500 --> 00:22:36,500
My car is parked at the back.

261
00:22:38,160 --> 00:22:41,380
Inside, there’s holy water
that can help Pokpong.

262
00:22:41,410 --> 00:22:43,760
Get him back to Punn.

263
00:22:43,790 --> 00:22:45,120
You can trust me.

264
00:22:48,260 --> 00:22:49,990
Pokpong.

265
00:22:55,100 --> 00:22:56,540
Hang in there, Pokpong.

266
00:23:13,830 --> 00:23:16,290
Mekhin, get Pokpong to the sofa now.

267
00:23:17,920 --> 00:23:18,750
Pokpong.

268
00:23:24,510 --> 00:23:25,340
Pokpong!

269
00:23:25,850 --> 00:23:26,890
What happened?

270
00:23:26,930 --> 00:23:29,760
He was already like this
when Mekhin brought him in.

271
00:23:29,800 --> 00:23:32,850
Ciar took his group
to attack the Hunters’ base.

272
00:23:32,880 --> 00:23:34,500
I was worried, so I followed them.

273
00:23:34,540 --> 00:23:35,730
I found Pokpong there.

274
00:23:43,900 --> 00:23:45,960
That’s Punn’s real brother!

275
00:23:45,990 --> 00:23:47,730
What if something bad had happened?

276
00:23:49,730 --> 00:23:51,180
Why are you angry?

277
00:23:51,780 --> 00:23:52,950
In the end,

278
00:23:52,980 --> 00:23:55,940
you handed that kid over to the vampires.

279
00:23:57,340 --> 00:23:59,100
Let’s stop, Jett.

280
00:24:00,200 --> 00:24:01,840
Nothing is getting any better.

281
00:24:06,200 --> 00:24:07,730
What would we gain from stopping?

282
00:24:12,510 --> 00:24:14,950
If you want to leave like Punn, fine.

283
00:24:15,460 --> 00:24:16,960
Go ahead.

284
00:25:08,660 --> 00:25:09,400
Punn.

285
00:25:11,970 --> 00:25:12,930
Have a seat.

286
00:25:20,980 --> 00:25:22,640
Pong hasn’t woken up.

287
00:25:26,140 --> 00:25:28,140
I already used my power to treat him.

288
00:25:28,570 --> 00:25:30,490
He’ll recover in a few hours.

289
00:25:31,370 --> 00:25:33,370
You saw when I treated Mekhin.

290
00:25:35,910 --> 00:25:38,210
Pong didn’t deserve to get hurt
because of me.

291
00:25:43,660 --> 00:25:46,140
You guys can talk when he wakes up.

292
00:25:47,180 --> 00:25:49,310
I’m sure he’ll understand.

293
00:25:55,670 --> 00:25:56,390
Pong.

294
00:25:57,510 --> 00:25:58,560
Ramil,

295
00:25:58,600 --> 00:26:00,180
you’re a vampire, aren’t you?

296
00:26:02,540 --> 00:26:04,410
Didn’t you get captured?

297
00:26:05,750 --> 00:26:06,700
No, Pong.

298
00:26:07,780 --> 00:26:08,950
Mr. Ramil didn’t capture me.

299
00:26:08,970 --> 00:26:10,430
Then why are you staying here?

300
00:26:10,460 --> 00:26:11,800
Why didn’t you come home?

301
00:26:12,770 --> 00:26:14,770
Do you know how worried sick I’ve been?

302
00:26:17,530 --> 00:26:19,140
Do you even still think I’m your brother?

303
00:26:19,610 --> 00:26:24,760
Why did you never tell me anything about your real job or whatever this crazy thing is?

304
00:26:25,720 --> 00:26:27,710
I’m sorry. Hear me out.

305
00:26:27,740 --> 00:26:29,710
Tell me what’s not true.

306
00:26:29,980 --> 00:26:31,540
Give me your excuses, Punn.

307
00:26:38,580 --> 00:26:40,580
So you guys are all vampires, huh?

308
00:26:41,350 --> 00:26:43,620
If you want to stay with them, go ahead.

309
00:26:44,300 --> 00:26:45,520
But I can’t.

310
00:26:47,020 --> 00:26:47,820
Pong.

311
00:26:48,370 --> 00:26:48,940
Punn.

312
00:26:49,950 --> 00:26:51,540
Let me follow him.

313
00:27:12,030 --> 00:27:13,700
If you’re here to make me go back there,

314
00:27:13,720 --> 00:27:14,870
I’m not going.

315
00:27:17,860 --> 00:27:21,560
I’m not. I’m here to buy a snack.

316
00:27:23,560 --> 00:27:24,210
Here.

317
00:27:30,530 --> 00:27:32,420
Be angry with me all you want,

318
00:27:35,190 --> 00:27:40,030
but your brother is worried about you,
you know?

319
00:27:41,340 --> 00:27:43,340
Whenever I disappeared,

320
00:27:43,970 --> 00:27:45,700
Punn never worried about me.

321
00:27:45,930 --> 00:27:47,600
You’ve been lying to me this whole time.

322
00:27:47,640 --> 00:27:49,180
Don’t you feel guilty at all?

323
00:27:49,210 --> 00:27:50,680
I trusted you.

324
00:27:51,220 --> 00:27:55,460
When have I lied to you? I’m a doctor.

325
00:27:55,480 --> 00:27:57,350
You worked at the minimart.

326
00:27:57,380 --> 00:27:59,590
I never lied to you about anything.

327
00:28:01,260 --> 00:28:06,860
The fact that I’m a vampire wasn’t exactly
something I was comfortable sharing.

328
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:14,720
When did you find out I was Punn’s brother?

329
00:28:17,340 --> 00:28:23,430
After you ran away. Do you know
your brother searched high and low for you?

330
00:28:29,320 --> 00:28:35,290
Every time you got in trouble at school
or even smoked, he forgave you.

331
00:28:37,600 --> 00:28:40,210
Punn has done everything to keep you safe.

332
00:28:41,430 --> 00:28:43,750
Won’t you forgive your brother?

333
00:28:47,400 --> 00:28:52,420
I’m just angry that everyone acted like
I’m a kid who doesn’t need to know anything.

334
00:28:53,270 --> 00:28:57,660
I’m mad at Punn for not telling me
he’s involved in something that dangerous.

335
00:28:58,090 --> 00:29:01,780
I’m mad at you too.

336
00:29:03,780 --> 00:29:05,350
Why are you mad at me?

337
00:29:05,390 --> 00:29:06,700
I don’t know. I’m just mad.

338
00:29:08,370 --> 00:29:10,370
Okay, how about this?

339
00:29:11,120 --> 00:29:12,130
I’m sorry.

340
00:29:13,220 --> 00:29:14,590
But honestly,

341
00:29:14,620 --> 00:29:18,780
if I’d just told you I was a vampire,

342
00:29:19,170 --> 00:29:20,450
wouldn’t you think I was crazy?

343
00:29:21,320 --> 00:29:22,030
Huh?

344
00:29:27,780 --> 00:29:28,790
I’m sorry.

345
00:29:34,680 --> 00:29:35,200
Here.

346
00:29:41,670 --> 00:29:43,020
I’m surprised you know
how to make up with people.

347
00:29:43,590 --> 00:29:45,340
I’m the troublemaker.

348
00:29:45,380 --> 00:29:46,710
I have to make up with my friends a lot.

349
00:29:46,940 --> 00:29:49,480
So are we friends now?

350
00:29:51,300 --> 00:29:52,500
Yeah.

351
00:29:53,480 --> 00:29:54,180
I guess.

352
00:29:55,100 --> 00:29:57,860
Nice to meet you, new friend.

353
00:30:00,300 --> 00:30:03,500
Nice to meet you too, friend.

354
00:30:18,780 --> 00:30:19,490
Pong.

355
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:20,690
Pong!

356
00:30:22,690 --> 00:30:23,980
Hear me out.

357
00:30:24,020 --> 00:30:25,300
Then you can be angry
or hate me all you want.

358
00:30:25,320 --> 00:30:26,670
Say no more.

359
00:30:31,300 --> 00:30:32,780
The doctor has told me everything.

360
00:30:49,170 --> 00:30:53,210
Once I found Elise’s car, I got Pokpong
out of there. I’m not sure if they noticed.

361
00:30:54,400 --> 00:30:57,730
If Jett knew Elise let us go,

362
00:30:58,270 --> 00:30:59,650
she’d be in trouble.

363
00:30:59,680 --> 00:31:03,980
The people I sent to watch them said that
many of the Hunters were injured,

364
00:31:04,010 --> 00:31:08,400
but Ciar’s group is just as bad, because Jett was able to put up a defense in time.

365
00:31:09,220 --> 00:31:10,500
How’s Ciar?

366
00:31:10,530 --> 00:31:11,730
He managed to run away,

367
00:31:11,750 --> 00:31:14,070
but we still don’t know where he is.

368
00:31:18,710 --> 00:31:20,860
The only way to end this

369
00:31:21,810 --> 00:31:23,550
is to deal with Feratu once and for all.

370
00:31:24,250 --> 00:31:26,830
I believe that if he’s really alive,

371
00:31:27,260 --> 00:31:29,260
he has something to do with the Hunters.

372
00:31:31,830 --> 00:31:35,520
How do we know for sure that
Feratu is really the bedridden priest?

373
00:31:36,580 --> 00:31:39,000
Not to mention the Hunters’ real motive.

374
00:31:39,500 --> 00:31:42,210
If we don’t fix this problem at its root cause,

375
00:31:43,040 --> 00:31:44,490
it’ll be hard to end it.

376
00:31:45,210 --> 00:31:46,150
Master,

377
00:31:47,190 --> 00:31:50,940
I’m afraid there’s only one way left.

378
00:31:53,090 --> 00:31:54,210
What way?

379
00:31:59,020 --> 00:32:06,540
I have to enter Punn’s memory
and see what really happened in the past.

380
00:32:08,840 --> 00:32:09,950
Do it.

381
00:32:17,740 --> 00:32:19,210
Please stop being mad at me.

382
00:32:19,240 --> 00:32:21,000
You’ve been mad for 15 minutes already.

383
00:32:21,180 --> 00:32:23,420
But you’ve been lying to me since yesterday.

384
00:32:25,420 --> 00:32:26,580
I’m sorry.

385
00:32:26,900 --> 00:32:28,900
Why did you lie?

386
00:32:28,930 --> 00:32:30,260
I already told you.

387
00:32:30,290 --> 00:32:31,720
It’s dangerous.

388
00:32:32,180 --> 00:32:35,930
But it’s the only way to end this.

389
00:32:35,970 --> 00:32:37,100
What if something happened to you?

390
00:32:37,130 --> 00:32:38,370
What would I do?

391
00:32:38,400 --> 00:32:42,400
Do you think I’d be safe if this doesn’t end?

392
00:32:43,220 --> 00:32:44,660
My brother almost died.

393
00:32:44,690 --> 00:32:46,060
Your family was injured.

394
00:32:46,760 --> 00:32:51,760
Mr. Ramil, I want a peaceful life
with the people I love.

395
00:32:59,500 --> 00:33:00,980
Can you do this for me?

396
00:33:03,620 --> 00:33:05,260
Let’s put an end to this together.

397
00:33:07,070 --> 00:33:08,960
But I’m really worried about you.

398
00:33:12,960 --> 00:33:14,050
If you’re so worried,

399
00:33:14,090 --> 00:33:15,820
then let’s keep a distance
from each other for now.

400
00:33:20,480 --> 00:33:21,360
What?

401
00:33:37,820 --> 00:33:39,820
Why are you breathing heavily?

402
00:33:40,430 --> 00:33:42,060
You don’t even breathe.

403
00:33:51,770 --> 00:33:52,420
If I died,

404
00:33:52,440 --> 00:33:53,090
No!

405
00:33:56,930 --> 00:33:59,430
I’m just imagining if I died.

406
00:33:59,440 --> 00:34:01,980
No. Don’t imagine that.

407
00:34:03,310 --> 00:34:06,410
If you die, I’ll die along with you.

408
00:34:14,350 --> 00:34:16,219
I love you so much, Punn.

409
00:34:17,230 --> 00:34:18,989
I love you more than anything.

410
00:34:21,820 --> 00:34:22,860
I know.

411
00:34:25,040 --> 00:34:26,260
I love you too.

412
00:34:31,440 --> 00:34:35,889
Please don’t be mad at me
for not using my power on you.

413
00:34:38,170 --> 00:34:42,420
I won’t. I know you’re worried about me.

414
00:34:42,780 --> 00:34:44,159
It’s normal to be scared.

415
00:34:45,730 --> 00:34:47,310
But I’m not scared,

416
00:34:49,710 --> 00:34:51,710
because I know you’re worried about me.

417
00:34:57,190 --> 00:34:59,190
I only imagined that I died,

418
00:35:00,100 --> 00:35:01,820
and you couldn’t even take it.

419
00:35:03,460 --> 00:35:06,510
How would you ever
let anything happen to me?

420
00:35:08,510 --> 00:35:10,900
But I…

421
00:35:10,920 --> 00:35:12,320
Please think about it.

422
00:35:13,550 --> 00:35:15,520
Try trusting our love.

423
00:35:17,860 --> 00:35:19,520
I think we’ll be fine.

424
00:35:40,640 --> 00:35:44,870
Maybe by entering my memory,

425
00:35:46,070 --> 00:35:48,070
you could leave something

426
00:35:48,780 --> 00:35:50,780
that leads me to you.

427
00:35:52,670 --> 00:35:56,980
Remember I told you I met you before?

428
00:35:58,490 --> 00:36:03,580
Both in my dreams and my memories.

429
00:36:04,300 --> 00:36:06,720
At first, I thought it was a coincidence.

430
00:36:09,610 --> 00:36:12,380
But when I found out
what your powers could do,

431
00:36:16,240 --> 00:36:21,940
I started to think
maybe we could decide everything.

432
00:36:24,760 --> 00:36:26,760
What do you mean?

433
00:36:27,720 --> 00:36:39,560
I just think that, besides entering my memory
to see if Father Dracul is your brother,

434
00:36:41,860 --> 00:36:45,200
you could also change
a lot of things in my life.

435
00:36:55,390 --> 00:36:57,600
Every time I’m scared of something,

436
00:36:59,300 --> 00:37:00,840
I see you.

437
00:37:03,520 --> 00:37:05,850
Every time I feel uncomfortable or sad,

438
00:37:06,320 --> 00:37:07,870
you’re there to comfort me.

439
00:37:10,860 --> 00:37:17,990
Maybe we’re together now
because of this journey.

440
00:37:28,960 --> 00:37:30,580
But no matter what happens,

441
00:37:32,140 --> 00:37:38,810
I hope this journey is a special one.

442
00:37:39,820 --> 00:37:41,140
It’ll be fine.

443
00:37:42,360 --> 00:37:45,720
I’m safest with you.

444
00:37:46,270 --> 00:37:52,010
And I hope all my memories
about you are true.

445
00:38:42,900 --> 00:38:44,510
How much longer until they’re done?

446
00:38:44,540 --> 00:38:45,930
I’m worried about Punn.

447
00:38:45,970 --> 00:38:47,490
Don’t worry about him.

448
00:38:47,540 --> 00:38:49,460
If something happens, he has me right here.

449
00:38:49,660 --> 00:38:51,050
I’ll use my power to heal him.

450
00:38:51,090 --> 00:38:52,490
No, Doctor.

451
00:38:52,500 --> 00:38:54,710
You have to say nothing will happen to him.

452
00:38:54,740 --> 00:38:56,890
And about that power,

453
00:38:56,920 --> 00:38:58,110
I’m still not used to it.

454
00:38:58,410 --> 00:38:59,990
Can it really heal?

455
00:39:00,190 --> 00:39:02,960
It’s just like when I healed you back then.

456
00:39:03,250 --> 00:39:06,650
You recovered and can walk around fine.

457
00:39:08,220 --> 00:39:09,160
Pokpong,

458
00:39:09,540 --> 00:39:14,010
you need to get used to
the vampire world already.

459
00:39:14,570 --> 00:39:16,970
Given Master and Mr. Punn’s relationship,

460
00:39:17,490 --> 00:39:19,990
we’ll be in each other’s lives for a long time.

461
00:39:23,380 --> 00:39:26,480
I guess once you’re in, there’s no getting out.

462
00:39:27,220 --> 00:39:28,020
I have an idea.

463
00:39:29,350 --> 00:39:31,740
Come sit down and relax.

464
00:39:31,770 --> 00:39:32,500
Come on.

465
00:39:36,150 --> 00:39:37,710
Don’t stress.

466
00:39:41,960 --> 00:39:42,590
Here.

467
00:39:52,490 --> 00:39:53,410
Where are you going?

468
00:39:53,980 --> 00:39:55,470
I need to take care of something.

469
00:39:55,500 --> 00:39:57,470
Please take care of Master and Mr. Punn.

470
00:39:57,500 --> 00:39:59,260
If anything happens, let me know right away.

471
00:40:08,370 --> 00:40:09,020
Eat up.

472
00:40:11,740 --> 00:40:12,570
Here.

473
00:40:21,740 --> 00:40:24,820
I found these documents under Jett’s desk.

474
00:40:25,100 --> 00:40:27,480
If what you told me is true,

475
00:40:27,520 --> 00:40:30,040
he must be hiding Father somewhere.

476
00:40:32,330 --> 00:40:38,460
RECEIPT/MEDICAL BILL SUMMARY

477
00:40:46,460 --> 00:40:48,550
Why did you change your mind
about helping me?

478
00:40:50,740 --> 00:40:58,240
I’m tired of loss, but this is probably all I can do to help you. You have to take it from here.

479
00:40:58,700 --> 00:40:59,980
Thank you.

480
00:41:00,940 --> 00:41:01,790
I have to go.

481
00:41:07,670 --> 00:41:08,660
Punn!

482
00:41:09,220 --> 00:41:10,380
What’s wrong with him?

483
00:41:10,830 --> 00:41:11,620
Punn!

484
00:41:14,770 --> 00:41:17,620
Mekhin, use your power to heal Master now.
