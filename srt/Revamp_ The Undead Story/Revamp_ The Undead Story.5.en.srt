The power that makes him the strongest leader of the vampires.

6
00:00:21,840 --> 00:00:23,280
Mind reading.

7
00:00:23,790 --> 00:00:26,290
My only goal in coming here

8
00:00:26,310 --> 00:00:27,760
is to kill you.

9
00:00:28,440 --> 00:00:33,790
If I have to die by your hands, I’m willing to.

10
00:00:36,180 --> 00:00:38,180
I really can’t kill you.

11
00:00:42,830 --> 00:00:44,410
I love you, Punn.

12
00:00:48,320 --> 00:00:50,800
The whole story began 13 years ago

13
00:00:50,830 --> 00:00:53,100
after my parents died in an accident.

14
00:00:53,140 --> 00:00:55,100
My younger brother and I were separated.

15
00:00:56,390 --> 00:00:58,570
MICHAEL ORPHANAGE
My new life started here.

16
00:01:06,920 --> 00:01:07,740
Hey, new kid!

17
00:01:07,770 --> 00:01:08,980
You’ve got a good grip on that ball.

18
00:01:09,010 --> 00:01:10,450
My name’s Jett.

19
00:01:10,480 --> 00:01:12,450
Do you want to join our soccer team?

20
00:01:21,230 --> 00:01:25,700
Three years later, that fateful night arrived.

21
00:01:28,080 --> 00:01:29,020
Punn!

22
00:01:29,980 --> 00:01:30,770
Punn, wake up!

23
00:01:30,789 --> 00:01:32,420
What, Elise?

24
00:01:32,460 --> 00:01:33,789
What’s going on?

25
00:01:33,840 --> 00:01:35,470
They’re breaking in!

26
00:01:35,490 --> 00:01:36,570
Where’s Jett?

27
00:01:59,180 --> 00:02:00,710
Let go of Jett!

28
00:03:12,710 --> 00:03:14,710
You’re awake. Why didn’t you wake me?

29
00:03:29,460 --> 00:03:31,780
Please don’t do this to me, Mr. Ramil.

30
00:03:34,220 --> 00:03:35,500
What am I doing?

31
00:03:37,890 --> 00:03:39,450
You’re trying to get close to me.

32
00:03:40,829 --> 00:03:42,460
You’re a vampire.

33
00:03:43,270 --> 00:03:44,750
I’m a hunter.

34
00:03:46,500 --> 00:03:48,500
We’re supposed to be enemies.

35
00:03:50,300 --> 00:03:52,140
What kind of enemies

36
00:03:52,160 --> 00:03:54,360
hug and kiss each other in bed?

37
00:04:03,580 --> 00:04:06,550
Don’t we both have feelings for each other?

38
00:04:20,610 --> 00:04:22,360
Don’t use that power on me.

39
00:04:23,880 --> 00:04:25,510
Don’t read my mind again.

40
00:04:32,420 --> 00:04:33,960
I’m sorry.

41
00:04:35,300 --> 00:04:37,090
From now on,

42
00:04:37,120 --> 00:04:41,060
I won’t use it without your permission.

43
00:04:43,460 --> 00:04:45,460
You’re probably confused right now.

44
00:04:47,060 --> 00:04:51,260
I’ll give you some time
to sort out your feelings.

45
00:06:50,780 --> 00:06:53,320
Master has ordered your friends
to be released, Mr. Punn.

46
00:06:53,350 --> 00:06:54,970
They’re all safe now.

47
00:06:55,600 --> 00:06:57,460
I had them wait downstairs.

48
00:06:57,500 --> 00:07:00,920
Please take them back.

49
00:07:08,460 --> 00:07:10,540
Mr. Punn has already left, Master.

50
00:07:11,710 --> 00:07:14,520
You’re questioning my actions, aren’t you?

51
00:07:16,020 --> 00:07:18,480
You must have your reasons
to trust Mr. Punn.

52
00:07:18,970 --> 00:07:21,580
I won’t interfere.

53
00:07:23,180 --> 00:07:26,080
But now that you have regained
all your powers,

54
00:07:26,100 --> 00:07:31,210
I believe the time has come
to hold the ceremony

55
00:07:31,930 --> 00:07:34,580
to reinstate you as the leader
according to the laws of Jonoel.

56
00:07:37,050 --> 00:07:39,320
I don’t want you to forget who you are

57
00:07:40,090 --> 00:07:42,180
and the great responsibilities that await you.

58
00:07:44,320 --> 00:07:46,320
As for humans and vampires,

59
00:07:48,420 --> 00:07:50,420
we’ll never truly coexist.

60
00:08:00,440 --> 00:08:05,380
WINNALA ANTIQUE BUYING, SELLING,
REPAIR & CONSERVATION

61
00:08:34,960 --> 00:08:36,370
Hello.

62
00:08:37,010 --> 00:08:41,350
I’m calling to let you know
the antique tiles you sent for repair are ready.

63
00:08:42,780 --> 00:08:45,810
I apologize for the temporary closure,

64
00:08:46,300 --> 00:08:50,490
but starting tomorrow, the shop will reopen.

65
00:08:51,300 --> 00:08:54,770
You can come by to pick them up
at your convenience.

66
00:08:57,630 --> 00:08:58,770
Thank you.

67
00:09:06,840 --> 00:09:07,540
Coming!

68
00:09:32,230 --> 00:09:35,960
Since you left, I haven’t visited your shop.

69
00:09:38,710 --> 00:09:42,180
It’s cute—so you.

70
00:09:42,590 --> 00:09:43,560
Thanks.

71
00:09:44,530 --> 00:09:46,530
But get to the point.

72
00:09:50,040 --> 00:09:52,040
I want to know the real reason.

73
00:09:52,400 --> 00:09:54,620
Why did you fail the mission?

74
00:09:55,970 --> 00:09:57,560
Tell me the truth, Punn.

75
00:09:58,210 --> 00:10:01,030
What did the last descendant of Jonoel
do to you?

76
00:10:07,110 --> 00:10:12,180
You already feel that strongly for him,
don’t you?

77
00:10:27,830 --> 00:10:29,600
So what are you going to do now?

78
00:10:31,250 --> 00:10:33,560
Will you stay here running the shop
with your brother?

79
00:10:38,590 --> 00:10:40,260
I honestly don’t know either.

80
00:10:41,600 --> 00:10:43,270
If I want to bring Pong here,

81
00:10:44,620 --> 00:10:46,620
I’ll have to clear everything up first.

82
00:10:49,660 --> 00:10:50,840
And what about you guys?

83
00:10:51,250 --> 00:10:53,490
You’ll continue the mission, right?

84
00:10:56,100 --> 00:11:00,190
Even without you,
Jett won’t give up that easily.

85
00:11:02,780 --> 00:11:04,780
I’m sorry to be blunt.

86
00:11:05,380 --> 00:11:08,120
But if you don’t want
to get involved in this anymore,

87
00:11:08,590 --> 00:11:11,850
you must get over Ramil, okay?

88
00:11:16,400 --> 00:11:17,110
Yeah.

89
00:11:18,460 --> 00:11:19,470
I’ll try.

90
00:12:26,580 --> 00:12:29,220
I’m sorry
you had to deliver this all the way here.

91
00:12:30,780 --> 00:12:31,990
No problem.

92
00:12:32,010 --> 00:12:34,510
The store offers delivery anyway.

93
00:12:40,270 --> 00:12:41,690
Look at that tense face.

94
00:12:42,420 --> 00:12:43,800
Are you okay?

95
00:12:43,830 --> 00:12:45,390
You can tell me.

96
00:12:49,550 --> 00:12:51,630
Doc, go take care of your patients.

97
00:12:51,660 --> 00:12:53,060
There’s an emergency case, right?

98
00:12:54,370 --> 00:12:55,850
I still have time.

99
00:12:55,880 --> 00:12:58,040
Come on, tell me.

100
00:13:00,430 --> 00:13:02,430
I followed what you said, doctor,

101
00:13:04,530 --> 00:13:07,360
but I still failed.

102
00:13:10,050 --> 00:13:12,700
It feels like my brother
is hiding something from me.

103
00:13:14,140 --> 00:13:16,780
He only said
he didn’t want me involved in it,

104
00:13:16,810 --> 00:13:18,950
so he didn’t want me to stay with him.

105
00:13:21,230 --> 00:13:23,500
It’s not really a failure.

106
00:13:24,190 --> 00:13:25,340
At least now you know

107
00:13:25,380 --> 00:13:27,630
it’s not that your brother
doesn’t want you around.

108
00:13:28,480 --> 00:13:29,860
He has his reasons.

109
00:13:30,780 --> 00:13:32,290
What’s the difference?

110
00:13:32,320 --> 00:13:34,570
In the end, we still don’t get to live together.

111
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:36,170
Of course it’s different.

112
00:13:37,200 --> 00:13:38,590
Your brother doesn’t hate you.

113
00:13:41,900 --> 00:13:43,300
There has to be a day.

114
00:13:44,940 --> 00:13:49,660
Right now, you just need to wait.

115
00:13:50,640 --> 00:13:52,640
When he’s ready,

116
00:13:53,790 --> 00:13:55,660
he’ll come back to you.

117
00:14:01,730 --> 00:14:03,100
I’ll go then.

118
00:14:03,120 --> 00:14:05,100
See you after my shift.

119
00:14:05,140 --> 00:14:05,840
Hey…

120
00:14:05,860 --> 00:14:07,700
Well, doc…

121
00:14:10,540 --> 00:14:13,940
Actually, I’ve already finished work today.

122
00:14:41,740 --> 00:14:43,740
Grape juice will make us feel better.

123
00:14:44,590 --> 00:14:45,810
Try some, Master.

124
00:14:54,890 --> 00:14:56,610
I guess in your eyes,

125
00:14:56,640 --> 00:15:00,200
I seem like someone really sick
who needs your care, huh?

126
00:15:01,820 --> 00:15:03,950
You already have healing powers.

127
00:15:03,980 --> 00:15:05,950
You don’t need me to heal you.

128
00:15:08,540 --> 00:15:11,790
As a doctor, you can’t refuse a patient.

129
00:15:14,010 --> 00:15:18,130
Fine. How are the symptoms?

130
00:15:18,780 --> 00:15:20,440
Tell me.

131
00:15:26,580 --> 00:15:28,580
Is there anything bothering you

132
00:15:28,610 --> 00:15:31,160
that you can’t talk to Methus and Ciar about?

133
00:15:35,220 --> 00:15:36,680
Is it about Mr. Punn?

134
00:15:46,680 --> 00:15:48,330
It’s a mess.

135
00:15:49,480 --> 00:15:52,980
Mr. Punn, the one who lifted your curse,

136
00:15:53,470 --> 00:15:56,540
turned out to be one of those people
sent to kill you.

137
00:15:57,400 --> 00:15:59,160
I feel sorry for him.

138
00:16:00,590 --> 00:16:04,570
Being around us
must feel really uncomfortable.

139
00:16:09,580 --> 00:16:11,580
You don’t pity me at all?

140
00:16:13,840 --> 00:16:17,360
But you’ve got all the benefits, Master.

141
00:16:18,130 --> 00:16:19,530
You’re free.

142
00:16:20,490 --> 00:16:22,490
You’ve regained your powers,

143
00:16:23,250 --> 00:16:27,230
and you’re about to be inaugurated
as the leader.

144
00:16:33,510 --> 00:16:35,250
But I have to lose Punn.

145
00:16:42,580 --> 00:16:48,350
I don’t really know how important
the inauguration is to you, Master.

146
00:16:49,850 --> 00:16:51,260
But to me,

147
00:16:52,180 --> 00:16:53,980
if it means losing the person I love,

148
00:16:56,180 --> 00:16:59,180
I wouldn’t choose that path.

149
00:17:01,180 --> 00:17:05,819
I’d be selfish and follow my heart.

150
00:17:11,220 --> 00:17:14,980
So that’s why
you chose to live as a human.

151
00:17:16,420 --> 00:17:17,140
Yes.

152
00:17:19,500 --> 00:17:21,190
I’m happy with my choice.

153
00:17:22,119 --> 00:17:28,220
Think about what life you want, Master.

154
00:17:29,680 --> 00:17:33,560
Will you follow your duty or your heart?

155
00:17:38,740 --> 00:17:43,760
As for the inauguration,
it can probably be postponed.

156
00:17:44,110 --> 00:17:47,900
Vampires have lived
hundreds of years without you.

157
00:17:48,370 --> 00:17:52,470
Waiting another hundred years won’t hurt.

158
00:17:53,540 --> 00:17:55,650
Humans, though, have limited lifespans.

159
00:17:56,660 --> 00:17:58,210
They’re not like vampires.

160
00:18:00,210 --> 00:18:02,360
Instead of taking care of us,

161
00:18:02,910 --> 00:18:04,960
why not use the time to care for Mr. Punn?

162
00:18:05,580 --> 00:18:07,390
Be with him and find happiness.

163
00:18:16,370 --> 00:18:17,700
I got it now, Mekhin.

164
00:18:18,030 --> 00:18:19,130
Thank you so much.

165
00:18:20,460 --> 00:18:25,580
Sure, but don’t forget to pay.

166
00:18:26,580 --> 00:18:28,340
Please proceed to cashier 4.

167
00:18:41,450 --> 00:18:42,460
This is tasty.

168
00:18:42,910 --> 00:18:43,890
I told you it’s good.

169
00:18:51,500 --> 00:18:52,560
He’s great.

170
00:18:52,630 --> 00:18:53,670
He’s also very hard-working.

171
00:18:54,120 --> 00:18:56,770
Let me know if you need anything.

172
00:18:56,810 --> 00:18:57,150
Sure.

173
00:18:57,180 --> 00:18:57,980
Thank you very much.

174
00:18:58,900 --> 00:19:00,180
There he is.

175
00:19:01,450 --> 00:19:02,470
Punn?

176
00:19:04,190 --> 00:19:05,460
What are you doing here?

177
00:19:07,180 --> 00:19:08,520
Pong, you finished work, right?

178
00:19:09,630 --> 00:19:10,780
Let’s go home.

179
00:19:15,250 --> 00:19:17,300
WINNALA ANTIQUE BUYING, SELLING,
REPAIR & CONSERVATION

180
00:19:20,990 --> 00:19:21,670
Pong.

181
00:19:22,870 --> 00:19:24,180
Sleep in the bed.

182
00:19:24,210 --> 00:19:25,500
I’ll take the floor.

183
00:19:25,540 --> 00:19:26,540
You’ve been tired from work.

184
00:19:26,560 --> 00:19:27,670
You should rest comfortably.

185
00:19:28,260 --> 00:19:30,690
No, Punn, you take the bed.

186
00:19:30,720 --> 00:19:31,810
I’ll sleep on the floor.

187
00:19:31,830 --> 00:19:33,120
I like hard floors.

188
00:19:33,840 --> 00:19:34,670
Are you sure?

189
00:19:34,690 --> 00:19:35,370
Yeah.

190
00:19:42,390 --> 00:19:43,780
This feels comfy.

191
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:49,180
Pong, get up first.

192
00:19:49,220 --> 00:19:50,460
Your hair is still wet.

193
00:19:50,480 --> 00:19:51,630
You’ll catch a cold.

194
00:19:54,670 --> 00:19:55,510
Come here.

195
00:20:05,080 --> 00:20:07,280
So, Punn,
you’re letting me stay with you now?

196
00:20:09,180 --> 00:20:12,420
Why? Don’t you want to stay with me?

197
00:20:12,690 --> 00:20:14,170
Of course I do!

198
00:20:14,190 --> 00:20:16,080
Why wouldn’t I?

199
00:20:16,830 --> 00:20:19,080
Then behave yourself,

200
00:20:19,130 --> 00:20:21,400
focus on school, and go back to that house.

201
00:20:22,140 --> 00:20:26,490
You can come stay here
whenever you have a day off, okay?

202
00:20:29,860 --> 00:20:35,730
Pong, I don’t want you to think
I’m pushing you away.

203
00:20:36,660 --> 00:20:38,660
I just want you to have a good future.

204
00:20:40,360 --> 00:20:41,780
You get that, right?

205
00:20:47,100 --> 00:20:49,940
As long as you don’t hate me, I’m fine.

206
00:20:51,140 --> 00:20:53,140
How could I ever hate you?

207
00:20:53,500 --> 00:20:55,350
You’re my only little brother.

208
00:20:58,860 --> 00:21:00,940
Now go, get some sleep. It’s late.

209
00:21:01,190 --> 00:21:03,410
Tomorrow you’re helping me
open the shop early.

210
00:21:04,960 --> 00:21:08,620
Deal! I’ll wake up before your alarm.

211
00:21:11,700 --> 00:21:13,010
I’ll be waiting.

212
00:21:22,610 --> 00:21:23,960
Good night, Punn.

213
00:21:24,750 --> 00:21:25,570
Yeah.

214
00:21:26,090 --> 00:21:27,030
Good night.

215
00:22:36,580 --> 00:22:38,580
YOU GOT A MESSAGE.

216
00:22:50,050 --> 00:22:50,900
Punn!

217
00:22:51,150 --> 00:22:52,570
What are you doing here?

218
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:56,100
I’m sorry to bother you this late.

219
00:22:56,980 --> 00:22:58,200
I missed you.

220
00:23:03,140 --> 00:23:04,510
I came for your answer.

221
00:23:06,510 --> 00:23:07,400
But it’s not the day yet.

222
00:23:07,420 --> 00:23:09,010
You said you’d give me time.

223
00:23:11,210 --> 00:23:14,360
Even so…I miss you so much
I can’t do anything else.

224
00:23:16,840 --> 00:23:19,860
Punn, if you’re uncomfortable
staying with the other vampires there,

225
00:23:19,880 --> 00:23:21,760
I can move in here with you.

226
00:23:23,010 --> 00:23:24,540
I’ll sleep on the sofa.

227
00:23:25,060 --> 00:23:26,500
I’m not that big,

228
00:23:26,540 --> 00:23:27,660
so I don’t take up much space.

229
00:23:27,870 --> 00:23:29,870
You can’t stay here.

230
00:23:30,530 --> 00:23:32,530
My brother is staying with me now.

231
00:23:32,870 --> 00:23:35,180
I don’t want him dragged into this.

232
00:23:38,880 --> 00:23:40,590
If you want an answer,

233
00:23:44,250 --> 00:23:46,250
I’ll reject you now.

234
00:23:48,600 --> 00:23:50,190
Go back to Jonoel.

235
00:23:54,070 --> 00:23:55,200
Wait, Punn!

236
00:24:01,580 --> 00:24:03,400
Please, not this answer.

237
00:24:07,840 --> 00:24:09,840
If it’s too soon for you,

238
00:24:10,100 --> 00:24:11,840
then I’ll give you more time.

239
00:24:13,580 --> 00:24:15,390
Let me stay here with you.

240
00:24:17,520 --> 00:24:19,380
Think it through,

241
00:24:21,230 --> 00:24:25,940
and then tell me if you love me or not.

242
00:24:31,110 --> 00:24:33,110
Alright. You can stay.

243
00:24:35,200 --> 00:24:38,110
But don’t let my brother find out who you are.

244
00:24:38,790 --> 00:24:40,000
Of course, Punn.

245
00:24:40,790 --> 00:24:44,280
I won’t let him know, no matter what.

246
00:24:50,520 --> 00:24:51,390
Who are you?

247
00:25:00,570 --> 00:25:01,890
Who is he, Punn?

248
00:25:02,930 --> 00:25:04,090
Well…

249
00:25:04,260 --> 00:25:05,460
That’s Mr. Ramil.

250
00:25:05,490 --> 00:25:06,300
Is he your boyfriend?

251
00:25:06,330 --> 00:25:06,870
Yes.

252
00:25:06,900 --> 00:25:07,980
No!

253
00:25:08,650 --> 00:25:09,750
Mr. Ramil,

254
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:11,750
don’t give my brother the wrong idea.

255
00:25:12,340 --> 00:25:13,860
So, is he or is he not?

256
00:25:14,310 --> 00:25:17,620
No. He’s my client.

257
00:25:18,540 --> 00:25:21,780
We worked upcountry together.

258
00:25:21,820 --> 00:25:23,380
He came to Bangkok with no place to stay,

259
00:25:23,760 --> 00:25:26,070
so I let him stay here.

260
00:25:27,180 --> 00:25:29,180
This is Pokpong, my younger brother.

261
00:25:30,380 --> 00:25:31,780
Hello, Pokpong.

262
00:25:32,250 --> 00:25:33,960
Your name has a great meaning.

263
00:25:34,290 --> 00:25:36,580
It sounds strong,

264
00:25:37,580 --> 00:25:39,290
like you can protect your brother.

265
00:25:46,780 --> 00:25:48,780
So how many nights will he stay?

266
00:25:49,270 --> 00:25:50,530
And where will he sleep?

267
00:25:50,810 --> 00:25:53,880
Just 2–3 nights.

268
00:25:55,980 --> 00:25:58,940
I’ll let him sleep on the sofa.

269
00:26:04,050 --> 00:26:05,660
If he’s really your client,

270
00:26:06,050 --> 00:26:07,710
is it okay to make him sleep on the sofa?

271
00:26:09,140 --> 00:26:11,140
Then where do you want him to sleep?

272
00:26:22,780 --> 00:26:24,360
You sleep here tonight.

273
00:26:25,890 --> 00:26:28,580
Punn, I’ve laid the bed already.

274
00:26:28,600 --> 00:26:29,610
Let’s sleep.

275
00:26:29,640 --> 00:26:30,840
I’m sleepy.

276
00:26:32,840 --> 00:26:33,530
Let’s go.

277
00:26:43,170 --> 00:26:44,600
You’re not afraid of ghosts, right?

278
00:26:47,430 --> 00:26:48,580
I’m not.

279
00:26:49,980 --> 00:26:52,080
Good.

280
00:26:54,080 --> 00:26:55,770
But be careful.

281
00:26:57,120 --> 00:26:59,020
This is an antique shop.

282
00:27:04,820 --> 00:27:08,640
Who knows what’s attached to these items?

283
00:27:11,790 --> 00:27:13,600
Pong, come to bed now.

284
00:27:15,450 --> 00:27:16,820
I’m going to bed.

285
00:27:17,520 --> 00:27:18,410
Good night.

286
00:27:19,850 --> 00:27:21,240
Ghosts will haunt you for sure!

287
00:28:58,220 --> 00:28:59,490
You’re awake?

288
00:28:59,970 --> 00:29:02,180
How was last night? Any ghosts?

289
00:29:03,940 --> 00:29:06,740
No, I slept well.

290
00:29:06,770 --> 00:29:08,280
I had sweet dreams all night.

291
00:29:09,400 --> 00:29:10,660
Enough, Pokpong.

292
00:29:10,690 --> 00:29:12,460
Mr. Ramil is my guest.

293
00:29:13,940 --> 00:29:15,140
Go back to mopping the floor.

294
00:29:20,900 --> 00:29:21,930
Are you hungry?

295
00:29:22,320 --> 00:29:23,840
Do you want anything for breakfast?

296
00:29:24,730 --> 00:29:27,120
It’s fine.

297
00:29:27,540 --> 00:29:31,430
My kind doesn’t even need food anyway.

298
00:29:33,430 --> 00:29:36,210
But is there anything I can help with?

299
00:29:38,780 --> 00:29:40,360
Not really.

300
00:29:40,720 --> 00:29:42,720
You should just rest on the sofa.

301
00:29:43,140 --> 00:29:45,670
Come on, Punn.

302
00:29:46,170 --> 00:29:48,170
If I only sit around,

303
00:29:49,300 --> 00:29:50,870
your brother will be suspicious.

304
00:29:53,550 --> 00:29:57,630
You should let me blend in
by helping you clean your shop.

305
00:30:03,980 --> 00:30:07,320
Fine, then mop over there.

306
00:30:09,410 --> 00:30:10,190
Yeah.

307
00:30:32,900 --> 00:30:33,800
Hey.

308
00:30:34,160 --> 00:30:35,860
If you don’t know how, just sit still.

309
00:30:36,220 --> 00:30:38,060
Act like a proper guest.

310
00:30:48,450 --> 00:30:49,110
Ouch!

311
00:30:51,370 --> 00:30:53,240
Fine, come here!

312
00:30:55,720 --> 00:30:57,110
Punn, let me help.

313
00:30:57,140 --> 00:30:58,470
Wait, wait.

314
00:31:05,660 --> 00:31:06,980
It won’t get done like this.

315
00:31:12,470 --> 00:31:13,740
Punn, help me!

316
00:31:15,770 --> 00:31:16,550
Pong.

317
00:31:16,860 --> 00:31:17,910
Hey, that’s enough.

318
00:31:20,450 --> 00:31:21,030
Pong.

319
00:31:21,620 --> 00:31:22,600
Stop it already.

320
00:31:22,620 --> 00:31:23,750
Go hang the laundry.

321
00:31:50,990 --> 00:31:52,050
That was close.

322
00:31:52,070 --> 00:31:53,530
Good thing you caught it in time.

323
00:31:54,210 --> 00:31:55,310
Incredible.

324
00:31:55,340 --> 00:31:56,930
I respect your speed.

325
00:32:00,460 --> 00:32:01,730
That’s nothing.

326
00:32:02,910 --> 00:32:06,920
I can do much cooler things.

327
00:32:07,620 --> 00:32:10,140
Wow. I just praised you a little,
and you’re already bragging.

328
00:32:17,090 --> 00:32:20,680
Hey, I know you like my brother.

329
00:32:22,680 --> 00:32:24,920
But I won’t accept you
as my brother-in-law that easily.

330
00:32:28,040 --> 00:32:29,310
Brother-in-law?

331
00:32:31,820 --> 00:32:34,600
So what do I need to do

332
00:32:34,920 --> 00:32:36,920
for you to accept me?

333
00:32:41,660 --> 00:32:44,520
Impress me, I guess.

334
00:32:45,490 --> 00:32:48,820
If you can, I’ll accept you.

335
00:32:49,470 --> 00:32:51,120
But I’m telling you,

336
00:32:51,510 --> 00:32:53,340
I don’t get impressed easily.

337
00:33:30,480 --> 00:33:32,170
I’m sorry, Pokpong.

338
00:33:53,230 --> 00:33:55,860
HAPPY BIRTHDAY.
BE A GOOD KID AND STAY HEALTHY.
STAY WITH ME FOREVER.

339
00:33:57,860 --> 00:34:00,390
Whoa, you scared me.

340
00:34:01,940 --> 00:34:04,940
Shh! Don’t be loud.

341
00:34:05,350 --> 00:34:07,060
If Pong hears, it won't be a surprise.

342
00:34:08,980 --> 00:34:12,550
You didn’t forget your brother’s birthday?

343
00:34:15,870 --> 00:34:17,550
How could I forget?

344
00:34:17,570 --> 00:34:18,960
He’s my little brother.

345
00:34:24,620 --> 00:34:25,739
I should put it here.

346
00:34:27,739 --> 00:34:28,380
Okay.

347
00:34:33,110 --> 00:34:35,960
Should I add more candles?

348
00:34:39,190 --> 00:34:40,639
It looks nice already.

349
00:34:49,670 --> 00:34:50,540
All done.

350
00:34:57,290 --> 00:34:59,290
Happy birthday, Pokpong.

351
00:35:12,320 --> 00:35:15,310
- THIS SHOP’S CAKE TASTES GREAT.
- I’LL BUY IT FOR YOU NEXT TIME.

352
00:35:24,100 --> 00:35:24,750
BUT I DON’T EVEN LIKE GRAPES.
YOU’RE THE ONE WHO DOES.

353
00:35:24,780 --> 00:35:25,340
THEN WHAT CAKE DO YOU LIKE, POKPONG?
I’LL BUY IT FOR YOU.

354
00:35:25,340 --> 00:35:28,280
Young coconut cake, please.

355
00:35:28,300 --> 00:35:30,280
Is it your birthday, doctor?

356
00:35:30,700 --> 00:35:36,380
No, it’s for someone I know.

what was written on the cake.

367
00:37:19,630 --> 00:37:22,940
It said, “Be a good kid.”

368
00:37:22,970 --> 00:37:24,340
“Stay healthy.”

369
00:37:25,120 --> 00:37:26,820
“Stay with me forever.”

370
00:37:26,870 --> 00:37:29,250
Whoa, that’s touching.

371
00:37:29,290 --> 00:37:31,740
It’s too bad I couldn’t take a photo of it.

372
00:37:32,960 --> 00:37:34,640
It’s all because of you, Ramil.

373
00:37:34,680 --> 00:37:36,400
You shouldn’t have scared me.

374
00:37:38,100 --> 00:37:40,230
But never mind.

375
00:37:41,070 --> 00:37:44,620
I’m just glad you remembered my birthday.

376
00:37:48,110 --> 00:37:50,250
If I forgot,

377
00:37:50,870 --> 00:37:53,380
I’d really be a terrible brother.

378
00:38:01,120 --> 00:38:02,470
I know that all this time,

379
00:38:03,940 --> 00:38:08,500
I’ve made you feel like I don’t love you,

380
00:38:10,130 --> 00:38:11,890
or that we’re distant.

381
00:38:13,370 --> 00:38:14,630
I’m sorry.

382
00:38:18,590 --> 00:38:20,230
My hands are still messy.

383
00:38:36,340 --> 00:38:39,230
Punn, I’m going out tonight.

384
00:38:39,250 --> 00:38:40,930
I’ll be back in the morning.

385
00:38:40,970 --> 00:38:42,590
I’ve got work at the minimart.

386
00:38:44,030 --> 00:38:46,140
Working even on your birthday?

387
00:38:48,230 --> 00:38:49,340
No, actually.

388
00:38:49,980 --> 00:38:52,660
I just want to give you two some alone time.

389
00:38:53,980 --> 00:38:54,460
Pong!

390
00:38:54,500 --> 00:38:57,710
there’s something between you.

391
00:38:58,330 --> 00:39:00,720
Ramil isn’t really your client, right?

392
00:39:00,770 --> 00:39:02,270
See? Gotcha. I knew it!

393
00:39:02,300 --> 00:39:03,900
Quiet, Pong!

394
00:39:03,930 --> 00:39:05,420
Oh, Punn.

395
00:39:09,380 --> 00:39:09,400
Thanks a lot for the birthday surprise.

396
00:39:12,410 --> 00:39:15,700
Also, tell Ramil I’m really impressed.

397
00:39:16,100 --> 00:39:17,540
I’ll accept him as my brother-in-law.

398
00:39:18,170 --> 00:39:18,850
Pong!

399
00:39:18,870 --> 00:39:19,940
Gotcha!

400
00:39:20,980 --> 00:39:21,890
You brat!

401
00:39:32,060 --> 00:39:32,720
Hey.

402
00:39:33,210 --> 00:39:33,970
Hmm?

403
00:39:34,000 --> 00:39:35,640
Come mop this spot too.

404
00:39:42,010 --> 00:39:44,810
Yes, sir, Mr. Punn.

405
00:39:47,900 --> 00:39:48,740
Move.

406
00:39:58,340 --> 00:39:59,520
Hey.

407
00:39:59,560 --> 00:40:00,390
Hmm?

408
00:40:00,810 --> 00:40:02,240
Make sure you clean it properly.

409
00:40:02,940 --> 00:40:03,830
Got it?

410
00:40:03,860 --> 00:40:04,940
Yes, sir.

411
00:40:04,970 --> 00:40:06,730
And throw the trash out back.

412
00:40:07,080 --> 00:40:08,450
Yes, sir.

413
00:40:08,460 --> 00:40:10,340
And put that bucket away in the back too.

414
00:40:10,610 --> 00:40:12,090
Yes, sir.

415
00:40:36,260 --> 00:40:36,920
Here.

416
00:40:50,260 --> 00:40:51,720
Thank you, doctor.

417
00:40:55,410 --> 00:40:56,990
Eat it all, okay?

418
00:41:08,920 --> 00:41:10,730
Come on, Punn.

419
00:41:10,860 --> 00:41:12,140
Get a grip.

420
00:41:12,620 --> 00:41:13,850
Your heart is all over the place!

421
00:42:02,720 --> 00:42:04,140
I have something to talk to you about.

422
00:42:19,820 --> 00:42:20,900
You know, before this,

423
00:42:22,000 --> 00:42:25,960
my brother and I weren’t together.

424
00:42:28,690 --> 00:42:30,340
We were separated for so many years

425
00:42:32,340 --> 00:42:36,910
that I could barely remember
I even had a brother.

426
00:42:40,840 --> 00:42:42,420
But a few years ago,

427
00:42:44,220 --> 00:42:47,320
Pong, who was taken in by a foster family, contacted me.

428
00:42:50,750 --> 00:42:52,460
When we met,

429
00:42:57,260 --> 00:42:59,060
he was still the same as ever.

430
00:43:03,190 --> 00:43:04,980
Only I had changed.

431
00:43:08,980 --> 00:43:10,980
I’m no longer just his brother.

432
00:43:14,980 --> 00:43:16,540
I’m the Hunter,

433
00:43:18,880 --> 00:43:24,730
a vampire hunter who could
bring danger to him at any moment.

434
00:43:40,930 --> 00:43:42,320
I’m sorry

435
00:43:43,000 --> 00:43:45,000
for using my power on your brother.

436
00:43:48,540 --> 00:43:50,540
I just wanted to connect with him.

437
00:43:53,670 --> 00:43:56,270
I just want to live here with you.

438
00:44:04,270 --> 00:44:06,270
Give me one more chance, Punn.

439
00:44:09,220 --> 00:44:12,500
You can’t stop your instincts, Mr. Ramil.

440
00:44:12,860 --> 00:44:14,330
I can, Punn.

441
00:44:14,660 --> 00:44:16,660
I’ll do anything for you.

442
00:44:18,120 --> 00:44:19,100
Tell me.

443
00:44:19,110 --> 00:44:22,820
What should I do
to make up for what I did to your brother?

444
00:44:23,480 --> 00:44:25,310
I can do anything.

445
00:44:30,690 --> 00:44:33,300
I just want to be the best brother I can be,

446
00:44:35,830 --> 00:44:38,650
and I don’t want to put his life at risk.

447
00:44:40,140 --> 00:44:41,430
Wait, Punn.

448
00:44:41,470 --> 00:44:42,900
You know very well

449
00:44:43,200 --> 00:44:46,740
that my powers cause no harm.

450
00:44:48,900 --> 00:44:50,490
But you’re a vampire.

451
00:44:51,580 --> 00:44:52,930
You’re immortal.

452
00:44:54,780 --> 00:44:56,310
How could you possibly understand?

453
00:45:05,550 --> 00:45:06,950
For me,

454
00:45:08,570 --> 00:45:10,220
this isn’t something small.

455
00:45:12,300 --> 00:45:14,420
It’s about my brother’s life.

456
00:45:41,870 --> 00:45:43,410
You should go, Mr. Ramil.

457
00:45:44,820 --> 00:45:46,580
Go back to your duties.

458
00:45:49,160 --> 00:45:50,930
Let’s not see each other again.

459
00:45:53,500 --> 00:45:55,500
Between a human and a vampire,

460
00:45:58,310 --> 00:45:59,570
it’s impossible.

461
00:46:13,700 --> 00:46:15,830
Is that your answer, Punn?

462
00:46:22,300 --> 00:46:23,060
Yes.

463
00:46:24,460 --> 00:46:27,420
This is my answer, Mr. Ramil.

464
00:49:12,540 --> 00:49:13,720
I’m ready.

465
00:49:17,720 --> 00:49:19,400
Yes, Master.

466
00:49:30,960 --> 00:49:32,070
Ciar.

467
00:49:32,450 --> 00:49:35,980
Announce to all vampires across the lands

468
00:49:36,020 --> 00:49:39,140
that our leader has returned to the throne.

469
00:49:39,970 --> 00:49:41,820
By tomorrow nightfall,

470
00:49:41,870 --> 00:49:45,340
all vampires are to gather in full force

471
00:49:45,360 --> 00:49:48,960
to celebrate the inauguration
of the King of the Night.

472
00:49:49,320 --> 00:49:50,860
Attention all units.

473
00:49:50,900 --> 00:49:52,360
Targets on the move.

474
00:49:52,750 --> 00:49:55,310
Repeat. Targets on the move.

475
00:50:01,350 --> 00:50:05,380
Caster reports that
all vampires under our watch

476
00:50:05,420 --> 00:50:08,300
are converging at the target’s hideout.

477
00:50:08,320 --> 00:50:09,680
All units are ready.

478
00:50:09,710 --> 00:50:11,140
We’re awaiting your command.

479
00:50:11,430 --> 00:50:13,430
Tell every unit to execute the plan.

480
00:50:14,130 --> 00:50:15,720
They’ve all gathered like this.

481
00:50:16,110 --> 00:50:17,830
We can’t fail this time.

482
00:50:31,640 --> 00:50:33,400
Let’s finally end this.

483
00:51:16,330 --> 00:51:21,460
PUNN,
WE’RE ALL GOING TO STORM JONOEL.
THIS IS OUR FINAL CHANCE.

484
00:51:37,690 --> 00:51:39,690
It’s time, Master.

485
00:52:05,580 --> 00:52:06,660
Is it time?

486
00:52:08,210 --> 00:52:09,730
Yes, Ciar, it’s time.

487
00:52:16,340 --> 00:52:22,080
Now is the moment
for us to stop hiding,

488
00:52:22,720 --> 00:52:24,180
to stop living in fear.

489
00:52:25,310 --> 00:52:27,340
It’s time for our clan

490
00:52:27,380 --> 00:52:29,340
to rise and reclaim its power.

491
00:52:29,730 --> 00:52:33,250
No need to hide in the shadows anymore.

492
00:52:33,960 --> 00:52:41,700
By the power of the last descendant
of the pure Jonoel bloodline,

493
00:52:45,580 --> 00:52:50,920
Ramil Soleil Jonoel!

494
00:53:15,390 --> 00:53:16,140
Master.

495
00:53:44,590 --> 00:53:47,110
We’ll infiltrate their party.

496
00:53:48,980 --> 00:53:49,770
Follow me.

497
00:53:51,900 --> 00:53:53,060
Where are you taking me?

498
00:53:53,380 --> 00:53:54,370
Just follow me.

499
00:53:54,690 --> 00:53:56,070
I’m not going anywhere.
