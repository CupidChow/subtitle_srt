and created for entertainment purposes only.

They are not intended to urge or promote any behavior in the series.

Viewer discretion is advised.

5
00:00:16,790 --> 00:00:19,250
They’ve killed everyone else in the Jonoel bloodline.

6
00:00:19,270 --> 00:00:21,260
I can now confirm they’re the ones

7
00:00:21,280 --> 00:00:25,040
who vandalized the painting at the gallery to break the curse.

8
00:00:25,070 --> 00:00:27,990
And now you still want to trust humans?

9
00:00:40,820 --> 00:00:42,190
Enough, Ciar.

10
00:00:43,960 --> 00:00:45,170
It’s alright, Punn.

11
00:00:46,040 --> 00:00:47,510
I’ll protect you.

12
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:55,790
SEVERAL MONTHS EARLIER

13
00:01:37,979 --> 00:01:40,840
Male humans taste horrible.

14
00:01:55,840 --> 00:01:57,380
Your lipstick is smudged.

15
00:02:06,880 --> 00:02:07,980
Right here.

16
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:11,000
There’s a red stain.

17
00:02:20,579 --> 00:02:24,970
Would you do me the honor of
having a drink with me, pretty vampire?

18
00:04:10,860 --> 00:04:12,260
So it’s your group

19
00:04:12,290 --> 00:04:14,260
who’s been hunting and killing my family.

20
00:04:14,290 --> 00:04:16,260
So what?

21
00:04:18,140 --> 00:04:21,950
I’ll show you what a real hunter is.

22
00:04:43,750 --> 00:04:45,850
Why the hell were you shooting nonstop?

23
00:04:45,870 --> 00:04:46,880
We have limited bullets.

24
00:04:46,909 --> 00:04:48,350
It took me a long time to create each one.

25
00:04:48,380 --> 00:04:50,409
Why the hell did you slap me?

26
00:04:50,440 --> 00:04:51,980
I was shooting for you.

27
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:53,630
She got away because of you, idiot!

28
00:04:53,659 --> 00:04:55,290
You missed all the vital spots, dumbass!

29
00:04:55,320 --> 00:04:55,970
My bullets are great.

30
00:04:56,010 --> 00:04:57,110
Only one good shot would’ve killed her.

31
00:04:57,130 --> 00:04:58,210
They’re great, my ass!

32
00:04:58,230 --> 00:05:00,210
She ran the hell away!

33
00:05:00,540 --> 00:05:01,650
If you guys want to fight,

34
00:05:01,670 --> 00:05:02,710
go back to the House and do it there.

35
00:05:02,730 --> 00:05:03,660
What did I tell you?

36
00:05:03,700 --> 00:05:05,230
You need to focus on the field.

37
00:05:05,260 --> 00:05:06,200
Don’t mess around.

38
00:05:08,510 --> 00:05:09,320
How many times have I told you?

39
00:05:09,350 --> 00:05:10,500
You need to focus on the field.

40
00:05:12,420 --> 00:05:13,370
Are you alright?

41
00:05:13,890 --> 00:05:16,200
I’ll be fine once my wound is disinfected.

42
00:05:16,240 --> 00:05:18,550
Then I’ll only have the sprained ankle left.

43
00:05:25,530 --> 00:05:27,310
I’m sorry I failed, Jett.

44
00:05:28,340 --> 00:05:31,370
A pure-blood vampire is really powerful.

45
00:05:33,260 --> 00:05:37,820
The crafted bullets you let me try
didn’t work, Caster.

46
00:05:37,850 --> 00:05:40,030
See? She said they didn’t work, idiot.

47
00:05:40,050 --> 00:05:41,420
I’m not wrong.

48
00:05:41,460 --> 00:05:42,940
Damn it.

49
00:05:43,710 --> 00:05:45,500
We let the target get away like that.

50
00:05:46,010 --> 00:05:47,980
Would he be able to handle her on his own?

51
00:05:48,430 --> 00:05:52,550
Pure-blood vampires are really dangerous.

52
00:05:55,990 --> 00:05:56,980
Don’t worry.

53
00:06:06,570 --> 00:06:09,440
There’s no way that vampire will make it.

54
00:08:07,510 --> 00:08:10,320
Mr. Ramil, you don’t have to
keep staring at me.

55
00:08:10,770 --> 00:08:13,950
I told you Mr. Mekhin already treated me.

56
00:08:14,380 --> 00:08:16,900
The external wounds aren’t visible anymore.

57
00:08:18,930 --> 00:08:22,470
But Mekhin can’t heal your internal wounds.

58
00:08:24,980 --> 00:08:27,230
Mr. Ramil, what are you doing?

59
00:08:27,540 --> 00:08:28,330
Hey!

60
00:08:28,750 --> 00:08:30,750
I’m healing the wounds in your heart.

61
00:08:42,600 --> 00:08:44,600
You must’ve been so shocked.

62
00:08:46,140 --> 00:08:47,290
It’s alright now.

63
00:08:48,830 --> 00:08:52,710
I’ll always protect you
for as long as you want me to.

64
00:09:07,980 --> 00:09:08,960
Mr. Ramil,

65
00:09:09,740 --> 00:09:12,290
why are you protecting me so much?

66
00:09:14,190 --> 00:09:17,160
It’s because my blood can help
restore your powers, isn’t it?

67
00:09:18,780 --> 00:09:20,240
No, Punn.

68
00:09:21,330 --> 00:09:23,060
You matter more than that.

69
00:09:26,220 --> 00:09:27,720
How?

70
00:09:30,940 --> 00:09:35,240
To me, you…

71
00:09:45,850 --> 00:09:47,100
May I come in?

72
00:09:47,130 --> 00:09:48,120
You may not!

73
00:09:49,540 --> 00:09:50,260
Hey!

74
00:09:50,280 --> 00:09:52,370
Mr. Methus, please come in.

75
00:09:55,700 --> 00:09:56,670
Well…

76
00:10:03,280 --> 00:10:04,860
Did I come in at a bad time?

77
00:10:04,890 --> 00:10:05,980
- Yes.
- No.

78
00:10:11,140 --> 00:10:12,490
What is it?

79
00:10:13,300 --> 00:10:15,710
Ciar is awake now, Master.

80
00:10:18,950 --> 00:10:20,590
Feel free to scold

81
00:10:20,600 --> 00:10:22,590
or punish me any way you want,

82
00:10:22,860 --> 00:10:24,420
but don’t give me the silent treatment.

83
00:10:24,440 --> 00:10:25,680
It’s uncomfortable.

84
00:10:26,700 --> 00:10:28,860
You’re the one who has to apologize.

85
00:10:29,410 --> 00:10:32,250
Do you even realize what you’ve done?

86
00:10:32,270 --> 00:10:33,040
What?

87
00:10:33,930 --> 00:10:35,680
How are they?

88
00:10:35,730 --> 00:10:38,270
The ones you saved
have minor injuries, Master.

89
00:10:38,300 --> 00:10:42,310
The one Mr. Punn saved is badly injured,

90
00:10:42,340 --> 00:10:43,990
but he’s out of danger now.

91
00:10:44,880 --> 00:10:48,640
I made sure everyone is resting
and being monitored at Mekhin’s hospital.

92
00:10:48,670 --> 00:10:50,940
Once you get all your powers back,

93
00:10:50,980 --> 00:10:52,500
we can find a way to deal with the situation.

94
00:10:53,050 --> 00:10:53,780
Mmm.

95
00:10:56,620 --> 00:10:59,660
Thank you so much, you two.

96
00:11:01,510 --> 00:11:02,620
And…

97
00:11:03,040 --> 00:11:05,040
Thank you, too, Ciar,

98
00:11:05,610 --> 00:11:07,350
for still listening to me enough

99
00:11:07,830 --> 00:11:10,730
and not killing all those humans
like you said you would.

100
00:11:11,410 --> 00:11:17,410
But I still stand by my word
that I don’t agree with your rule at all.

101
00:11:18,020 --> 00:11:21,530
Humans don’t have a rule about killing us.

102
00:11:21,540 --> 00:11:26,650
We shouldn’t have a rule
about sparing their lives either.

103
00:11:29,140 --> 00:11:33,340
Not all humans are evil, Ciar.

104
00:11:37,940 --> 00:11:39,960
You’re saying

105
00:11:40,950 --> 00:11:44,760
Punn is not like the others, aren’t you?

106
00:11:45,820 --> 00:11:47,620
What kind of good person

107
00:11:48,720 --> 00:11:51,580
would agree to live with a vampire?

108
00:12:01,940 --> 00:12:05,940
You trust humans too much.

109
00:12:07,180 --> 00:12:10,750
You’re crossing the line, Ciar.

110
00:12:14,080 --> 00:12:15,270
Well,

111
00:12:15,780 --> 00:12:19,710
I’ll keep your concern in mind.

112
00:12:21,160 --> 00:12:24,210
What? Who says I’m worried about you?

113
00:12:24,660 --> 00:12:27,690
I just don’t have a good feeling
about your guy.

114
00:12:31,170 --> 00:12:32,330
Alright.

115
00:12:32,810 --> 00:12:35,720
Let’s talk about restoring powers
to our Master.

116
00:12:36,030 --> 00:12:37,090
Ciar.

117
00:12:37,930 --> 00:12:38,930
Mekhin.

118
00:12:39,450 --> 00:12:41,700
When will you two be ready
to perform the ritual?

119
00:13:51,470 --> 00:13:54,460
How do you know I like roses?

120
00:13:55,700 --> 00:13:59,540
If I told you I have the power to read minds,

121
00:14:00,130 --> 00:14:01,520
would you believe me?

122
00:14:04,710 --> 00:14:08,350
Then…what am I thinking right now?

123
00:14:18,700 --> 00:14:20,700
I actually have a dream.

124
00:14:22,010 --> 00:14:24,540
I dreamed of having a small, peaceful house

125
00:14:27,050 --> 00:14:28,750
where I could grow flowers,

126
00:14:30,280 --> 00:14:32,010
sit down to watch the sunset,

127
00:14:33,270 --> 00:14:34,970
and live a simple life

128
00:14:38,490 --> 00:14:39,960
with someone I love.

129
00:14:41,960 --> 00:14:45,230
Is this place like what you dream of?

130
00:14:45,260 --> 00:14:46,670
Do you like it here?

131
00:14:50,530 --> 00:14:52,780
Are you trying to ask me to stay?

132
00:14:53,760 --> 00:14:55,220
Or…

133
00:14:57,010 --> 00:14:59,010
do you have the power to read my mind?

134
00:14:59,030 --> 00:14:59,800
Hmm?

135
00:15:01,640 --> 00:15:05,500
Well, can I ask you to stay?

136
00:15:10,930 --> 00:15:17,010
Don’t you think it’s weird
for an ordinary human to live with a vampire?

137
00:15:18,320 --> 00:15:20,850
You’re saying

138
00:15:20,870 --> 00:15:23,100
Punn is not like the others, aren’t you?

139
00:15:23,510 --> 00:15:25,240
What kind of good person

140
00:15:25,270 --> 00:15:27,980
would agree to live with a vampire?

141
00:15:29,590 --> 00:15:30,880
I don’t think it’s weird.

142
00:15:33,850 --> 00:15:35,180
What do you think?

143
00:15:50,740 --> 00:15:51,480
Here.

144
00:15:53,220 --> 00:15:55,410
Can I keep in touch with you sometimes?

145
00:15:57,550 --> 00:15:59,630
I don’t want you to disappear.

146
00:16:00,540 --> 00:16:02,320
Even if you don’t stay here,

147
00:16:02,930 --> 00:16:07,700
can I at least hear your voice and text you?

148
00:16:15,980 --> 00:16:17,460
Do you know how to use it?

149
00:16:18,290 --> 00:16:19,570
You can teach me.

150
00:16:24,070 --> 00:16:25,230
Teach me.

151
00:16:28,690 --> 00:16:31,550
I’ll save my number first.

152
00:16:57,550 --> 00:17:00,130
Hey, don’t shoot randomly!

153
00:17:00,160 --> 00:17:01,730
We have limited bullets.

154
00:17:01,750 --> 00:17:02,720
Before you worry about the bullets,

155
00:17:02,740 --> 00:17:03,540
why don’t you worry about my life?

156
00:17:03,560 --> 00:17:04,720
You idiot!

157
00:17:04,760 --> 00:17:07,599
The first type of bullet is made from
sacred ore.

158
00:17:07,619 --> 00:17:10,810
They’re gold bullets that release
the power of light when fired.

159
00:17:10,839 --> 00:17:13,690
It limits the enemies’ movements.

160
00:17:13,720 --> 00:17:15,310
They should be temporarily paralyzed,

161
00:17:15,339 --> 00:17:17,609
making it easier for us to target them.

162
00:17:50,020 --> 00:17:53,540
The second type of bullet
is made mainly from silver ore.

163
00:17:53,560 --> 00:17:54,830
One shot is all it takes.

164
00:17:54,860 --> 00:17:56,830
No need to waste bullets.

165
00:18:02,830 --> 00:18:03,790
(Idiot!)

166
00:18:05,990 --> 00:18:07,100
You bastard!

167
00:18:07,670 --> 00:18:10,660
I almost died!

168
00:18:11,400 --> 00:18:13,690
Give me a little more time
to finish developing the bullets.

169
00:18:13,710 --> 00:18:16,620
I think I can take all of them out.

170
00:18:16,660 --> 00:18:17,340
Don’t worry.

171
00:18:17,980 --> 00:18:20,330
What do you think, Jett?

172
00:18:25,520 --> 00:18:28,640
Try to improve your bullets.

173
00:18:28,670 --> 00:18:30,740
As for your plan to develop other weapons,

174
00:18:30,770 --> 00:18:33,470
send me the file and I’ll forward it to Jett.

175
00:18:36,640 --> 00:18:37,500
Jett.

176
00:18:37,860 --> 00:18:40,630
Am I supposed to die
before you finish developing the bullets?

177
00:18:42,220 --> 00:18:43,100
Jett.

178
00:18:44,100 --> 00:18:45,650
Jett, stop.

179
00:18:46,130 --> 00:18:47,210
Where are you going?

180
00:18:47,250 --> 00:18:49,110
I don’t want to wait anymore.

181
00:18:49,130 --> 00:18:51,110
I’m going to kill him myself.

182
00:18:51,990 --> 00:18:53,990
If we can kill a leader like him,

183
00:18:54,780 --> 00:18:56,710
we can put an end to all of this, Elise.

184
00:18:57,470 --> 00:19:02,220
Do you realize Ramil is not like
the other vampires we’ve killed before?

185
00:19:03,730 --> 00:19:07,470
Jett, I know you’re hurting

186
00:19:07,500 --> 00:19:09,230
and very anxious right now,

187
00:19:09,700 --> 00:19:11,770
but you have to be more patient.

188
00:19:12,740 --> 00:19:16,390
If we lose you, it’s over for all of us.

189
00:19:18,140 --> 00:19:22,440
Please, Jett. Can you stick to our plan?

190
00:19:23,060 --> 00:19:25,370
If you want any more information,

191
00:19:25,400 --> 00:19:27,370
I’ll find it for you.

192
00:19:37,370 --> 00:19:38,580
WINNALA ANTIQUE BUYING, SELLING,
REPAIR & CONSERVATION

193
00:19:38,600 --> 00:19:42,700
SORRY, WE’RE TEMPORARILY CLOSED.
(Sorry, it’s not possible to reach
the number you’ve dialed at the moment.)

194
00:19:49,130 --> 00:19:52,290
(Sorry, it’s not possible to reach
the number you’ve dialed…)

195
00:19:57,960 --> 00:20:02,550
WHERE ARE YOU, PUNN?
WHY ARE YOU AVOIDING ME?

196
00:20:23,260 --> 00:20:24,340
Um…

197
00:20:27,920 --> 00:20:28,790
Excuse me.

198
00:20:29,510 --> 00:20:30,540
Excuse me.

199
00:20:32,100 --> 00:20:34,260
Do you still have any grape jelly candy left?

200
00:20:38,260 --> 00:20:39,940
Just a moment. I’ll restock the shelf for you.

201
00:20:50,150 --> 00:20:51,640
You like grapes, Doctor?

202
00:20:54,490 --> 00:20:59,040
Yes, eating them calms my mind.

203
00:20:59,470 --> 00:21:02,710
Whenever I get a lot of accident cases,

204
00:21:02,740 --> 00:21:04,710
I freak out a bit.

205
00:21:04,730 --> 00:21:07,000
So I have to eat the grape jelly candy.

206
00:21:07,710 --> 00:21:09,790
It’s like drinking wine to comfort myself,

207
00:21:10,160 --> 00:21:12,900
so I can focus on my patients.

208
00:21:16,750 --> 00:21:18,290
You’re not afraid of blood, are you?

209
00:21:20,160 --> 00:21:21,980
What kind of doctor is afraid of blood?

210
00:21:22,570 --> 00:21:23,420
None.

211
00:21:23,620 --> 00:21:26,530
I thought you were afraid of the blood
from the accident patients.

212
00:21:31,220 --> 00:21:33,970
The total is 139 baht and 50 satang.

213
00:21:34,010 --> 00:21:34,560
Okay.

214
00:21:37,120 --> 00:21:37,970
Done.

215
00:21:40,690 --> 00:21:43,100
I’m sorry for restocking the shelf late.

216
00:21:43,130 --> 00:21:47,980
Next time, I’ll make sure your favorite
grape jelly candy is fully stocked.

217
00:21:48,310 --> 00:21:48,790
Thanks.

218
00:21:53,040 --> 00:21:55,250
POKPONG

219
00:21:55,860 --> 00:21:56,400
Here.

220
00:22:01,360 --> 00:22:03,540
Hold out your hand, Pokpong.

221
00:22:05,320 --> 00:22:06,940
How do you know my name?

222
00:22:08,990 --> 00:22:10,980
Oh, my nametag.

223
00:22:13,530 --> 00:22:14,250
Here you go.

224
00:22:19,160 --> 00:22:22,990
You’re still a student. Smoking is bad.

225
00:22:23,580 --> 00:22:26,020
Whenever you want to smoke,

226
00:22:26,040 --> 00:22:27,420
try eating that instead.

227
00:22:30,240 --> 00:22:31,390
I’m going now.

228
00:22:45,140 --> 00:22:47,300
Don’t worry. I’ve been through that.

229
00:22:47,340 --> 00:22:50,110
It actually doesn’t hurt that much.

230
00:22:51,310 --> 00:22:52,760
I’m not afraid of the pain.

231
00:22:53,260 --> 00:22:54,670
I just don’t like that.

232
00:22:55,780 --> 00:22:58,500
What kind of vampire is afraid of blood?

233
00:22:59,040 --> 00:23:00,420
How embarrassing.

234
00:23:06,100 --> 00:23:08,100
It smells good.

235
00:23:08,560 --> 00:23:11,890
When we perform the ritual, make sure
to hide the smell of your blood well.

236
00:23:11,930 --> 00:23:14,660
If I lose control,

237
00:23:15,710 --> 00:23:17,340
you’ll lose all the blood in your body.

238
00:23:17,360 --> 00:23:18,340
Ciar.

239
00:23:29,490 --> 00:23:30,760
Don’t worry, Punn.

240
00:23:31,260 --> 00:23:32,810
We have Methus.

241
00:23:35,460 --> 00:23:37,930
What happened last time
won’t happen again.

242
00:23:39,100 --> 00:23:40,950
Don’t be afraid, Mr. Punn.

243
00:23:41,430 --> 00:23:42,860
After the ritual,

244
00:23:42,890 --> 00:23:44,480
I’ll deal with those two.

245
00:23:45,660 --> 00:23:47,340
What do you want me to do?

246
00:23:51,620 --> 00:23:55,060
Can you stay and take care of me?

247
00:23:59,220 --> 00:24:00,100
Yes.

248
00:24:01,160 --> 00:24:02,500
Let’s go, Master.

249
00:24:02,880 --> 00:24:04,520
It’s time for the ritual.

250
00:24:20,780 --> 00:24:22,520
Be honest, Mr. Ramil.

251
00:24:23,500 --> 00:24:25,580
How do you know I like roses?

252
00:24:26,780 --> 00:24:30,430
You really don’t believe I can read minds?

253
00:24:32,820 --> 00:24:34,370
Your scent

254
00:24:34,850 --> 00:24:36,800
is like this rose.

255
00:24:41,480 --> 00:24:42,940
I don’t smell anything.

256
00:25:02,830 --> 00:25:06,200
A vampire’s sense of smell is spot-on.

257
00:25:08,040 --> 00:25:11,430
You smell like roses.

258
00:25:12,290 --> 00:25:16,300
Whenever I see them, I think of you.

259
00:25:21,300 --> 00:25:22,570
Alright, I’ll believe you.

260
00:25:28,900 --> 00:25:30,540
What are you doing?

261
00:25:34,280 --> 00:25:36,890
You say roses make you think of me.

262
00:25:36,910 --> 00:25:39,340
So I want to take some photos
to look at when I think of you.

263
00:25:43,160 --> 00:25:45,100
You won’t be able to capture me.

264
00:25:48,380 --> 00:25:51,200
But I can take photos of you.

265
00:25:54,680 --> 00:25:56,120
Do you know how to do that?

266
00:25:56,740 --> 00:25:59,220
I’m just going to do what you do.

267
00:25:59,820 --> 00:26:01,410
Do it properly.

268
00:26:01,440 --> 00:26:05,050
Here. Position the camera like this
and press the button in the middle.

269
00:26:05,080 --> 00:26:06,620
Press the button in the middle.

270
00:26:15,510 --> 00:26:16,240
Hey.

271
00:26:16,660 --> 00:26:17,980
How many photos are you going to take?

272
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:19,080
That’s enough.

273
00:26:27,130 --> 00:26:29,170
It’s me, Methus.

274
00:26:31,920 --> 00:26:32,540
Yes?

275
00:26:33,340 --> 00:26:34,770
I’m here about Master Ramil.

276
00:26:34,810 --> 00:26:36,770
He’s worn out and resting in his room.

277
00:26:37,670 --> 00:26:40,970
Could you go and take care of him?

278
00:26:41,950 --> 00:26:43,950
I’m going to take care of the other two.

279
00:26:44,900 --> 00:26:45,740
Okay.

280
00:27:27,060 --> 00:27:28,000
Hey!

281
00:27:28,580 --> 00:27:30,100
Let go of me!

282
00:27:31,380 --> 00:27:34,290
Hey! I thought you said
the ritual would wear you out.

283
00:27:36,180 --> 00:27:37,110
Hey!

284
00:27:39,250 --> 00:27:40,140
Hey!

285
00:27:40,590 --> 00:27:41,310
Ouch!

286
00:27:48,650 --> 00:27:49,550
Hey.

287
00:27:51,260 --> 00:27:52,240
Ugh.

288
00:28:48,120 --> 00:28:48,890
Hey.

289
00:28:49,230 --> 00:28:50,660
What are you doing?

290
00:28:50,690 --> 00:28:52,460
Let go of me! Hey!

291
00:28:54,240 --> 00:28:56,710
Weren’t you going to give me
a morning kiss?

292
00:28:58,370 --> 00:28:59,950
What are you talking about?

293
00:28:59,980 --> 00:29:01,570
We’re not a thing.

294
00:29:02,930 --> 00:29:06,050
Then do you want to try being something?

295
00:29:08,560 --> 00:29:09,140
Hey.

296
00:29:09,170 --> 00:29:10,130
No.

297
00:29:10,150 --> 00:29:10,900
Hey.

298
00:29:11,670 --> 00:29:12,900
Let go of me.

299
00:29:20,540 --> 00:29:22,140
I’ll let go of you

300
00:29:22,510 --> 00:29:23,940
if you give me something in return.

301
00:29:25,720 --> 00:29:27,420
If you let me…

302
00:29:28,500 --> 00:29:29,960
pinch your cheeks,

303
00:29:30,760 --> 00:29:32,440
I’ll let go of you nicely.

304
00:29:33,820 --> 00:29:34,770
What?

305
00:29:34,800 --> 00:29:35,610
No way.

306
00:29:35,960 --> 00:29:36,880
Then…

307
00:29:38,300 --> 00:29:39,970
Give me a morning kiss instead.

308
00:29:41,750 --> 00:29:42,680
Hey.

309
00:29:52,900 --> 00:29:53,720
Fine.

310
00:29:55,720 --> 00:29:58,220
I’ll let you pinch my cheeks,

311
00:29:59,730 --> 00:30:01,300
but only once,

312
00:30:02,220 --> 00:30:03,700
and only for five seconds.

313
00:30:03,730 --> 00:30:04,820
Okay.

314
00:30:13,400 --> 00:30:14,180
One.

315
00:30:15,710 --> 00:30:16,640
Two.

316
00:30:18,340 --> 00:30:19,310
Three.

317
00:30:20,610 --> 00:30:21,570
Four.

318
00:30:22,620 --> 00:30:23,460
Five.

319
00:30:23,800 --> 00:30:24,470
Ugh.

320
00:30:25,380 --> 00:30:26,100
Ouch.

321
00:30:26,140 --> 00:30:26,900
Ugh.

322
00:30:56,690 --> 00:30:59,950
POKPONG: WHERE ARE YOU, PUNN?
WHY ARE YOU AVOIDING ME?

323
00:31:05,980 --> 00:31:08,270
I’M ON A WORK TRIP IN ANOTHER CITY.

324
00:31:08,300 --> 00:31:09,960
SORRY FOR NOT TELLING YOU.
PLEASE DON’T WORRY.

325
00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:11,620
Who are you texting?

326
00:31:14,430 --> 00:31:17,640
I’m sorry, Mr. Ciar, but that’s personal.

327
00:31:17,690 --> 00:31:19,220
You’re full of secrets.

328
00:31:19,510 --> 00:31:22,300
Just don’t let me catch you red-handed.

329
00:31:22,340 --> 00:31:26,540
I have sharp senses and a keen nose.

330
00:31:50,300 --> 00:31:51,700
What’s wrong?

331
00:31:53,000 --> 00:31:55,180
Why are you afraid to face our Master?

332
00:31:56,570 --> 00:31:57,950
Why are you avoiding his eyes?

333
00:32:01,890 --> 00:32:03,470
Did you do something wrong?

334
00:32:04,960 --> 00:32:06,460
What are you talking about, Ciar?

335
00:32:07,350 --> 00:32:13,410
I saw this human texting someone.

336
00:32:14,360 --> 00:32:16,540
I was texting my younger brother.

337
00:32:17,230 --> 00:32:18,860
He’s worried because I’ve been missing.

338
00:32:18,890 --> 00:32:20,550
I haven’t reached out to him.

339
00:32:20,570 --> 00:32:21,460
You’re lying.

340
00:32:22,520 --> 00:32:26,690
My gut tells me you were texting the hunters.

341
00:32:27,160 --> 00:32:32,410
You’d better confess you’re one of them.

342
00:32:34,960 --> 00:32:42,340
I promise I won’t kill you…cruelly.

343
00:32:42,360 --> 00:32:43,980
POKPONG: WHERE ARE YOU, PUNN?
WHY ARE YOU AVOIDING ME?

344
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:45,960
I’M ON A WORK TRIP IN ANOTHER CITY.
SORRY FOR NOT TELLING YOU.
PLEASE DON’T WORRY.

345
00:32:47,220 --> 00:32:48,110
Ciar,

346
00:32:48,140 --> 00:32:52,460
you shouldn’t accuse anyone without proof.

347
00:32:56,000 --> 00:32:56,900
Fine.

348
00:32:57,620 --> 00:32:59,620
I’ll find the proof.

349
00:33:07,450 --> 00:33:09,810
Please excuse me. I need to go on duty.

350
00:33:15,230 --> 00:33:17,230
Please excuse me as well.

351
00:33:17,260 --> 00:33:18,520
I have an appointment today.

352
00:33:31,500 --> 00:33:33,670
Can I ask you something?

353
00:33:36,530 --> 00:33:38,740
Can I trust you right now?

354
00:33:39,020 --> 00:33:40,410
I don’t have to prove anything.

355
00:33:40,430 --> 00:33:41,740
If you want to kill me,

356
00:33:44,720 --> 00:33:48,680
you’ll need to pierce the center of my heart
with pure silver ore.

357
00:33:49,360 --> 00:33:52,500
But my skin is as strong as armor right now,

358
00:33:53,790 --> 00:33:58,140
so the best weapon would be a silver knife.

359
00:34:01,450 --> 00:34:03,090
Why are you telling me this?

360
00:34:06,460 --> 00:34:10,420
Because I want you to know that I trust you.

361
00:34:14,170 --> 00:34:17,659
My life is in your hands now.

362
00:34:47,179 --> 00:34:49,530
This painting is called Moonstruck.

363
00:34:50,239 --> 00:34:51,850
I know the owner.

364
00:34:51,870 --> 00:34:54,719
If you’re interested, I can introduce you.

365
00:34:57,890 --> 00:34:59,350
You asked to meet me.

366
00:34:59,380 --> 00:35:00,830
Is there something you want to discuss?

367
00:35:02,270 --> 00:35:05,980
Our gallery is preparing for a new exhibition,

368
00:35:06,010 --> 00:35:10,870
so Mr. Jett wanted me to reach out and see
if you had a collection that fits our theme.

369
00:35:12,190 --> 00:35:15,980
Haven’t you guys had enough
after the last incident?

370
00:35:18,620 --> 00:35:21,920
You’re a very funny man, Mr. Methus.

371
00:35:22,720 --> 00:35:24,930
By the way,

372
00:35:25,250 --> 00:35:28,420
is the restoration work finished?

373
00:35:28,460 --> 00:35:31,060
I haven’t been able to contact the team.

374
00:35:31,090 --> 00:35:34,350
I told you I’d handle it myself.

375
00:35:34,860 --> 00:35:38,800
That means you guys don’t need to know any of my business anymore.

376
00:35:39,980 --> 00:35:41,390
Is there anything else?

377
00:35:41,820 --> 00:35:43,340
If not, please excuse me.

378
00:35:45,060 --> 00:35:49,430
Can I talk to you about those guys
I sent you two days ago?

379
00:35:54,010 --> 00:35:56,380
Can you tell me

380
00:35:56,780 --> 00:35:58,580
how they’re doing right now?

381
00:36:50,580 --> 00:36:53,500
I’ve fixed the frame and replaced the mirror.

382
00:36:54,120 --> 00:36:59,470
As for the painting underneath, I painted over the original based on what I remember.

383
00:37:00,440 --> 00:37:02,820
Feel free to take a look
and let me know if it looks okay to you.

384
00:37:06,340 --> 00:37:08,410
Are you really going to leave this place?

385
00:37:13,680 --> 00:37:17,750
My part in your power-restoring ritual is done

386
00:37:18,620 --> 00:37:20,900
and I’ve finished restoring the painting.

387
00:37:22,900 --> 00:37:25,220
I don’t need to be here anymore.

388
00:37:36,700 --> 00:37:40,550
What if I asked you to create
a new painting of me?

389
00:37:43,100 --> 00:37:47,380
Would that buy me more time to be with you?

390
00:37:54,280 --> 00:37:56,580
But I don’t have any more canvases.

391
00:38:03,610 --> 00:38:05,670
You can use your notebook.

392
00:38:19,670 --> 00:38:21,690
Headshot, baby!

393
00:38:21,720 --> 00:38:23,540
Can you take a photo of me?

394
00:38:23,570 --> 00:38:24,530
Of course.

395
00:38:26,690 --> 00:38:28,960
I almost went blind. How’s the photo?

396
00:38:29,960 --> 00:38:30,900
Amazing.

397
00:38:31,400 --> 00:38:32,940
Hey, let’s go fill our glasses.

398
00:38:32,980 --> 00:38:34,190
Let’s keep drinking.

399
00:38:53,060 --> 00:38:56,180
Whoa, it’s only early evening
and you’re already getting drunk?

400
00:38:56,730 --> 00:38:57,660
Where’s Jett?

401
00:38:58,840 --> 00:39:01,250
He’s probably in his office.

402
00:39:01,290 --> 00:39:04,870
I don’t know. I haven’t seen him all day.

403
00:39:08,870 --> 00:39:09,640
Cheers.

404
00:39:09,660 --> 00:39:10,150
Yeah.

405
00:39:10,170 --> 00:39:11,030
Come on.

406
00:39:11,900 --> 00:39:12,740
Jett.

407
00:39:27,420 --> 00:39:28,800
Where are you?

408
00:39:29,060 --> 00:39:30,800
Is something urgent?

409
00:39:30,830 --> 00:39:35,240
(Everyone we sent on the mission
is still alive.)

410
00:39:35,560 --> 00:39:36,640
What do you mean?

411
00:39:36,690 --> 00:39:38,680
(They didn’t kill our family.)

412
00:40:11,500 --> 00:40:12,690
Jett, they’re here.

413
00:40:14,910 --> 00:40:15,710
Elise!

414
00:40:51,980 --> 00:40:53,700
Is it because of what Ciar said?

415
00:40:54,740 --> 00:40:56,280
Is that why you’re leaving?

416
00:41:02,570 --> 00:41:05,700
There’s a reason why he hates humans.

417
00:41:08,500 --> 00:41:10,500
I’ve told you before, right?

418
00:41:11,110 --> 00:41:17,020
Ciar, Mekhin, and Methus
were once humans.

419
00:41:19,350 --> 00:41:22,800
Methus was a prince and an army leader.

420
00:41:24,260 --> 00:41:26,660
In his final days as a human,

421
00:41:28,250 --> 00:41:32,740
he was betrayed by a soldier he trusted.

422
00:41:37,000 --> 00:41:39,380
So I gave him eternal life.

423
00:41:40,430 --> 00:41:48,310
Since then, Methus swore to serve me
and follow my rules strictly.

424
00:41:49,980 --> 00:41:52,020
As for poor Ciar,

425
00:41:54,540 --> 00:41:57,020
he was just a slave
who was lured to be killed.

426
00:41:57,490 --> 00:42:02,230
Those humans believed bathing in innocent children’s blood preserved their youth.

427
00:42:02,800 --> 00:42:04,800
Methus was the one who found him.

428
00:42:05,580 --> 00:42:07,580
I told Ciar he’d be alright

429
00:42:09,460 --> 00:42:11,460
and gave him a new life.

430
00:42:12,360 --> 00:42:18,460
Since then, he’s loved me
and followed my lead.

431
00:42:22,140 --> 00:42:23,570
What about Mr. Mekhin?

432
00:42:24,390 --> 00:42:26,800
Mekhin was a combat medic.

433
00:42:27,540 --> 00:42:31,820
He was shot while saving a fellow soldier.

434
00:42:32,980 --> 00:42:34,580
His wound became infected,

435
00:42:35,610 --> 00:42:37,900
causing excruciating pain,

436
00:42:38,620 --> 00:42:42,260
but he tried to travel home
to say goodbye to his family.

437
00:42:44,260 --> 00:42:45,960
So we helped him.

438
00:42:47,110 --> 00:42:50,580
But Mekhin didn’t know
how to control his instincts back then.

439
00:42:50,600 --> 00:42:53,400
Instead of saying goodbye to his family,

440
00:42:53,430 --> 00:42:56,600
he ended all their lives.

441
00:42:56,630 --> 00:43:00,160
So, did you get the solid proof
you were looking for?

442
00:43:09,380 --> 00:43:11,380
They all deserve sympathy.

443
00:43:13,210 --> 00:43:17,270
But you know who’s the most pitiful, Punn?

444
00:43:23,270 --> 00:43:24,460
It’s me.

445
00:43:38,540 --> 00:43:40,900
I’ll become the most pitiful vampire

446
00:43:43,780 --> 00:43:47,350
if you decide to leave me in the end.

447
00:43:48,860 --> 00:43:51,240
Even if you have no reason to stay here,

448
00:43:53,340 --> 00:43:55,340
can you please stay with me?

449
00:43:57,730 --> 00:43:59,330
Why, Mr. Ramil?

450
00:44:01,500 --> 00:44:04,440
Why do you want me
to stay here with you so much?

451
00:44:15,000 --> 00:44:17,160
If I told you how I feel,

452
00:44:19,870 --> 00:44:21,270
would you believe me?

453
00:44:23,460 --> 00:44:25,930
Give it a try,

454
00:44:28,530 --> 00:44:33,500
and then I’ll decide what to do.

455
00:45:31,500 --> 00:45:32,860
Alright, Mr. Ramil.

456
00:45:34,020 --> 00:45:35,970
I’ll stay here with you.

457
00:45:39,370 --> 00:45:40,280
Thank you, Punn.

458
00:46:18,280 --> 00:46:22,510
IT’S TIME FOR YOU
TO DEAL WITH THE TARGET, PUNN.

459
00:46:25,780 --> 00:46:26,540
Jett.

460
00:46:27,750 --> 00:46:31,090
It’s very late. Why are you back here?

461
00:46:42,300 --> 00:46:43,970
Don’t worry, Father.

462
00:46:45,140 --> 00:46:47,060
By the time you wake up,

463
00:46:48,510 --> 00:46:50,750
I’ll have annihilated all those vampires.

464
00:46:52,530 --> 00:46:54,700
Especially that filthy Jonoel bloodline.

465
00:46:57,010 --> 00:46:58,190
I promise.

466
00:46:59,200 --> 00:46:59,900
Hey!

467
00:47:00,310 --> 00:47:01,150
Hey!

468
00:47:05,030 --> 00:47:07,140
Hey, I’m cold.

469
00:47:12,860 --> 00:47:16,180
You like Mr. Punn very much, don’t you?

470
00:47:20,950 --> 00:47:22,700
I’m going home for a bit.

471
00:47:23,110 --> 00:47:24,880
I’ll be back as soon as I can.
