5
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:18,000
Let’s get out of here.

6
00:00:18,600 --> 00:00:20,100
I don’t want to run away from
problems anymore.

7
00:00:21,060 --> 00:00:24,500
I want to go back and face them.
I want to make things right.

8
00:00:29,520 --> 00:00:31,780
Call off your plan and leave.

9
00:00:36,980 --> 00:00:37,670
Damn it!

10
00:00:39,740 --> 00:00:40,970
Jett, are you okay?

11
00:00:41,580 --> 00:00:42,250
I’m fine.

12
00:00:43,520 --> 00:00:44,550
What about the rest of us?

13
00:00:45,230 --> 00:00:47,310
Everyone else is back here at the pub.

14
00:00:47,890 --> 00:00:51,010
That jerk could control
people’s minds that much?

15
00:00:52,450 --> 00:00:54,700
My plan fell apart all because of him.

16
00:00:55,820 --> 00:00:57,990
We did everything we could.

17
00:00:59,920 --> 00:01:03,500
There has to be a way
to deal with his power.

18
00:02:37,310 --> 00:02:38,300
What do you think you’re doing?

19
00:02:40,990 --> 00:02:42,750
I’m just worried Mr. Mekhin
might feel cold.

20
00:02:43,180 --> 00:02:44,300
I’m talking about...

21
00:02:44,930 --> 00:02:46,500
how you guys barged into this place

22
00:02:47,800 --> 00:02:49,850
and how you’re just
standing here like that.

23
00:02:50,570 --> 00:02:53,100
These vampires are my family.

24
00:02:53,840 --> 00:02:57,100
I won’t let your group hurt them
without fighting back.

25
00:02:57,710 --> 00:02:59,980
This isn’t the time to pick a fight, Ciar.

26
00:03:00,310 --> 00:03:02,300
It’s not like I want to talk
to that human,

27
00:03:02,980 --> 00:03:04,530
but I can’t just stand by and do nothing,

28
00:03:04,920 --> 00:03:08,010
watching him walk around
comfortably in our home

29
00:03:08,080 --> 00:03:10,300
after he’s just killed our family!

30
00:03:10,600 --> 00:03:12,170
I can’t do what you’re doing, Master.

31
00:03:13,400 --> 00:03:15,300
If Punn had really known about it,

32
00:03:15,740 --> 00:03:17,110
he wouldn’t have let it happen.

33
00:03:17,540 --> 00:03:19,150
I wouldn’t have either.

34
00:03:20,560 --> 00:03:23,700
I don’t know if you really didn’t know,

35
00:03:24,790 --> 00:03:26,400
or were just pretending to have no idea.

36
00:03:27,240 --> 00:03:29,610
If they wanted to come up with
an evil plan,

37
00:03:30,130 --> 00:03:32,300
they could find a way to hide it from you.

38
00:03:34,090 --> 00:03:35,300
You’ve been lied to before.

39
00:03:38,640 --> 00:03:39,970
Why do you trust

40
00:03:40,770 --> 00:03:42,200
and believe in humans?

41
00:03:43,500 --> 00:03:45,480
You keep letting him lead you by the nose.
Haven’t you learned your lesson?

42
00:03:45,500 --> 00:03:47,100
Watch your words, Ciar.

43
00:03:48,190 --> 00:03:49,850
You’re being disrespectful to Master.

44
00:03:52,480 --> 00:03:53,450
What I’m saying is true.

45
00:03:54,720 --> 00:03:59,200
Your Master is putting humans
before his family.

46
00:04:01,310 --> 00:04:02,580
We’ve been attacked.

47
00:04:03,130 --> 00:04:04,500
So many of us have been killed.

48
00:04:05,860 --> 00:04:08,700
Even Mekhin is injured.

49
00:04:09,130 --> 00:04:11,970
Why are you still protecting
this two-faced human?

50
00:04:12,960 --> 00:04:14,600
If you don’t care about us,

51
00:04:15,380 --> 00:04:20,600
then as a leader, you should at least
think about our clan members who died.

52
00:04:20,670 --> 00:04:21,399
Ciar!

53
00:04:25,900 --> 00:04:26,800
Are you happy now?

54
00:04:28,070 --> 00:04:32,100
You’ve brainwashed us vampires
and turned us against each other.

55
00:04:33,800 --> 00:04:36,200
Maybe this is one of the Hunters’ plans.

56
00:05:15,560 --> 00:05:17,310
I don’t care what our leader thinks.

57
00:05:18,710 --> 00:05:21,100
I won’t stand by and let them hurt us.

58
00:05:22,110 --> 00:05:23,300
I’m going to get revenge.

59
00:05:26,260 --> 00:05:27,370
Anyone who agrees can follow me.

60
00:05:44,950 --> 00:05:45,570
What is it?

61
00:05:46,240 --> 00:05:48,150
(An 18-year-old is asking
to enter the pub.)

62
00:05:48,280 --> 00:05:49,950
Anyone underage cannot enter!

63
00:05:50,710 --> 00:05:52,430
Please let me in.
I’m not here to hang out.

64
00:05:52,450 --> 00:05:53,400
I’m here to talk about
something important.

65
00:05:53,550 --> 00:05:56,300
My boss is in a bad mood right now.
Please don’t cause any trouble.

66
00:05:56,510 --> 00:05:57,030
Just go.

67
00:05:58,080 --> 00:05:59,400
Your boss is Jett, right?

68
00:06:00,900 --> 00:06:02,400
Tell him my name is Pokpong.

69
00:06:02,840 --> 00:06:05,500
I’m Punn’s brother. Jett knows me.

70
00:06:06,650 --> 00:06:08,170
Please let me in.

71
00:06:08,570 --> 00:06:09,900
You can tell Jett.

72
00:06:09,970 --> 00:06:11,180
Hey, kid.

73
00:06:12,050 --> 00:06:15,100
Who did you say was your brother?

74
00:06:23,300 --> 00:06:23,950
Have a seat.

75
00:06:34,430 --> 00:06:35,900
What do you want to talk to me about?

76
00:06:37,650 --> 00:06:39,210
I haven’t been able to reach Punn.

77
00:06:40,060 --> 00:06:40,900
I…

78
00:06:42,070 --> 00:06:43,450
I need to talk to him.

79
00:06:45,100 --> 00:06:46,700
I went to the gallery
on your business card,

80
00:06:46,730 --> 00:06:48,600
but they said you’ve been
at the pub lately.

81
00:06:49,720 --> 00:06:51,210
That’s why I came to see you here.

82
00:06:55,460 --> 00:06:56,800
Have you been able to reach Punn?

83
00:06:57,550 --> 00:06:58,750
Have you talked to him at all?

84
00:07:08,160 --> 00:07:12,500
What’s so urgent that
you need to talk to Punn?

85
00:07:16,370 --> 00:07:19,500
I found a lot of strange weapons
in the house, in Punn’s hidden room.

86
00:07:21,090 --> 00:07:22,850
I’m worried he’s involved in
dangerous stuff.

87
00:07:32,720 --> 00:07:33,890
Don’t worry, Pokpong.

88
00:07:34,900 --> 00:07:36,570
I’ll take you to see Punn.

89
00:07:49,010 --> 00:07:51,900
If you water them too much,
they might die.

90
00:07:58,350 --> 00:08:04,300
These roses look beautiful,
but they need special care.

91
00:08:05,680 --> 00:08:09,850
They get a lot of pests
and are sensitive to water and the sun.

92
00:08:10,510 --> 00:08:11,900
You have to handle them with extreme care.

93
00:08:15,200 --> 00:08:17,400
I wish I could read these roses’ minds.

94
00:08:21,330 --> 00:08:25,700
I wish I knew what they wanted
and what was wrong with them,

95
00:08:28,510 --> 00:08:30,300
so I could take the best care of them.

96
00:08:33,210 --> 00:08:37,350
I feel really bad for being the reason
your family is fighting.

97
00:08:42,159 --> 00:08:45,300
If family means the people I love,

98
00:08:47,520 --> 00:08:49,500
then you’re my family too.

99
00:08:52,540 --> 00:08:55,010
But what about Ciar?

100
00:08:56,350 --> 00:08:57,780
I know Ciar well.

101
00:08:59,170 --> 00:09:00,550
You have to give him time.

102
00:09:01,750 --> 00:09:03,850
It’s not worth following him right now.
He won’t listen.

103
00:09:07,740 --> 00:09:09,700
I’m really worried about you, Mr. Ramil.

104
00:09:11,130 --> 00:09:12,500
I don’t want to get you in trouble.

105
00:09:13,270 --> 00:09:14,950
I’m worried about you too, Punn.

106
00:09:16,430 --> 00:09:19,600
And I don’t want you to think
you’re a troublemaker.

107
00:09:21,950 --> 00:09:27,400
From now on, I want you to talk to me.

108
00:09:28,780 --> 00:09:29,700
Can you do that, Punn?

109
00:09:31,700 --> 00:09:33,300
I don’t want you to feel alone.

110
00:09:44,400 --> 00:09:46,100
I really appreciate that, Mr. Ramil.

111
00:09:48,510 --> 00:09:50,100
I’ve never received this kind of love.

112
00:09:59,150 --> 00:10:02,600
Get used to it, because from now on,

113
00:10:03,690 --> 00:10:08,400
I’ll love and take care of you
as best I can,

114
00:10:12,610 --> 00:10:14,250
even more than these roses.

115
00:10:16,850 --> 00:10:21,300
But you said these roses are
hard to look after.

116
00:10:22,670 --> 00:10:24,420
Even though they’re hard to look after,

117
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:30,300
once they bloom,
they become the most beautiful.

124
00:11:28,710 --> 00:11:32,600
Thank you, Mr. Punn,
for taking such good care of me.

125
00:11:34,140 --> 00:11:37,180
Your Master is the one
taking good care of you.

126
00:11:40,610 --> 00:11:42,000
Just rest and recover for now.

127
00:11:42,920 --> 00:11:44,210
Don’t go out making mischief just yet.

128
00:11:44,880 --> 00:11:46,300
Where would I go?

129
00:11:47,780 --> 00:11:50,350
I just have to go back to work
at the hospital.

130
00:11:51,220 --> 00:11:52,100
Where’s Ciar?

131
00:11:53,740 --> 00:11:54,780
Did he go out?

132
00:11:59,920 --> 00:12:01,650
He has a little problem.

133
00:12:06,780 --> 00:12:07,600
It’s okay.

134
00:12:08,640 --> 00:12:11,600
I’ll find the right time to talk to him.

135
00:12:12,280 --> 00:12:13,700
But for now, you should rest.

136
00:12:24,500 --> 00:12:29,100
What about the Hunters?
What are we going to do with them?

137
00:12:29,630 --> 00:12:31,300
I’m gathering information.

138
00:12:32,370 --> 00:12:37,700
If we want to end the conflict, we have to
at least know their real motive.

139
00:12:38,960 --> 00:12:42,700
If you’re going to do anything about Ciar,
be careful.

140
00:12:43,870 --> 00:12:45,180
Don’t be another one causing trouble.

141
00:12:57,960 --> 00:12:58,800
Well…

142
00:12:59,580 --> 00:13:01,800
Vampires are such posers, right?

143
00:13:05,390 --> 00:13:07,050
But you’re also a vampire, Mr. Mekhin.

144
00:13:08,430 --> 00:13:10,100
You don’t have to be so polite.

145
00:13:10,730 --> 00:13:12,200
If we’re only counting human years,

146
00:13:13,070 --> 00:13:16,100
I might be younger than you.

147
00:13:19,250 --> 00:13:20,500
I think you’re right.

148
00:13:21,810 --> 00:13:23,800
You’re the youngest in the family, Mekhin.

149
00:13:25,610 --> 00:13:31,500
I’m so happy when people call me
the youngest of my three amazing brothers.

150
00:13:32,420 --> 00:13:33,850
What about you, Punn?

151
00:13:34,590 --> 00:13:35,700
Do you have any siblings?

152
00:13:37,910 --> 00:13:39,150
I have a younger brother.

153
00:13:40,690 --> 00:13:42,790
But my family doesn’t really get
to spend time together.

154
00:13:44,920 --> 00:13:49,900
And I’m not a cool big brother like yours.

155
00:13:51,450 --> 00:13:52,700
Don’t think like that.

156
00:13:54,440 --> 00:13:55,700
My brothers?

157
00:13:55,870 --> 00:13:57,000
One can run fast.

158
00:13:58,170 --> 00:13:59,600
One can talk to crows.

159
00:14:00,450 --> 00:14:01,600
One can read minds.

160
00:14:01,970 --> 00:14:07,500
But none of my cool brothers has the power
to make a delicious porridge like this.

161
00:14:12,350 --> 00:14:15,700
Thank you, Mekhin, the youngest brother.

162
00:14:16,490 --> 00:14:20,000
Yes, Punn, the oldest brother.

163
00:14:22,910 --> 00:14:25,200
Alright, have some porridge.

164
00:14:25,270 --> 00:14:25,980
Thank you.

165
00:14:26,870 --> 00:14:28,500
Wow, that looks so good.

166

WINNALA ANTIQUE
BUYING, SELLING, REPAIR & CONSERVATION

167
00:14:55,280 --> 00:14:57,700
Oh, Pokpong is not here.

168
00:14:58,350 --> 00:15:01,300
Yeah, I guess he’s still
at his part-time job.

169
00:15:02,690 --> 00:15:03,300
Come on.

170
00:15:30,200 --> 00:15:32,650
FROM POKPONG: I WON’T BE BACK FOR A WEEK.

171
00:15:35,030 --> 00:15:39,700
Punn, what do we do with this
green plant called broc-something?

172
00:15:41,300 --> 00:15:42,500
Do we need to put it in the fridge?

173
00:16:13,930 --> 00:16:15,100
Why do you seem so distracted?

174
00:16:16,570 --> 00:16:17,250
Me?

175
00:16:17,810 --> 00:16:18,400
Mmm.

176
00:16:21,400 --> 00:16:23,000
Are you worried about Pokpong?

177
00:16:25,900 --> 00:16:27,900
He normally just disappears like this.

178
00:16:28,970 --> 00:16:30,500
Why are you worried this time?

179
00:16:32,330 --> 00:16:34,350
Because he normally just disappears.

180
00:16:35,150 --> 00:16:36,400
That's why I’m worried.

181
00:16:37,340 --> 00:16:41,300
He never texted me how many days
he’d be gone, but he did this time.

182
00:16:55,490 --> 00:16:56,550
Relax, Punn.

183
00:16:57,760 --> 00:16:59,900
He might be home with his new family.

184
00:17:01,120 --> 00:17:02,300
Hmm…

185
00:17:03,440 --> 00:17:04,700
Or maybe he’s been caught up
with his friends.

186
00:17:08,790 --> 00:17:10,099
Or maybe he’s dating someone.

187
00:17:11,180 --> 00:17:14,000
It’s not like Pong to run off
to be with a partner.

188
00:17:18,640 --> 00:17:20,300
You ran off to be with me.

189
00:17:20,800 --> 00:17:22,200
What’s gotten into you?

190
00:17:23,569 --> 00:17:25,500
I’m just trying to cheer you up.

191
00:17:27,490 --> 00:17:30,600
Anyway, I’m hungry.

192
00:17:30,960 --> 00:17:31,650
Come on.

193
00:17:37,040 --> 00:17:37,600
Hmm?

194
00:17:37,950 --> 00:17:40,380
We were so busy shopping
at the supermarket today

195
00:17:40,520 --> 00:17:41,710
that we haven't eaten.

196
00:17:42,630 --> 00:17:44,600
Why didn’t you tell me you were hungry?

197
00:17:47,430 --> 00:17:49,500
Because I wanted to eat your cooking.

198
00:17:57,310 --> 00:17:57,950
Here.

199
00:18:03,380 --> 00:18:04,150
Is this a rabbit?

200
00:18:06,150 --> 00:18:08,200
Hey. That’s a steamed bun.

201
00:18:10,010 --> 00:18:11,700
Eat it. It’s tasty.

202
00:18:19,440 --> 00:18:20,000
Hey.

203
00:18:21,350 --> 00:18:22,100
Steamed Punn.

204
00:18:23,180 --> 00:18:24,400
What are you doing?

205
00:18:27,740 --> 00:18:29,350
Hey, not yet.

206
00:18:30,570 --> 00:18:31,800
Remove the paper first.

207
00:18:33,120 --> 00:18:33,700
Let go.

208
00:18:35,760 --> 00:18:37,700
This is paper. You can’t eat it.

209
00:18:50,170 --> 00:18:53,700
You really are a cool big brother.

210
00:18:56,790 --> 00:18:57,800
A cool big brother?

211
00:18:59,410 --> 00:19:00,000
Yeah.

212
00:19:01,110 --> 00:19:06,600
Mr. Mekhin told me you’re a cool
and smart big brother.

213
00:19:07,970 --> 00:19:11,000
You know what to do
and when to say things.

214
00:19:12,470 --> 00:19:13,980
I get your little brothers.

215
00:19:15,320 --> 00:19:19,000
Just having you makes me feel better.

216
00:19:25,010 --> 00:19:25,770
Hmm…

217
00:19:28,290 --> 00:19:29,100
Little brothers?

218
00:19:30,210 --> 00:19:33,300
Yeah, they’re your little brothers.

219
00:19:43,870 --> 00:19:44,650
Little Punn.

220
00:19:47,510 --> 00:19:49,400
What are you doing? Keep eating.

221
00:19:57,600 --> 00:19:58,650
Careful not to choke.

222
00:20:06,420 --> 00:20:07,600
Pokpong is not here.

223
00:20:07,670 --> 00:20:10,000
He hasn’t been home in a while.

224
00:20:11,580 --> 00:20:14,000
Have you called or contacted him at all?

225
00:20:15,710 --> 00:20:18,700
I last spoke to him last week.

226
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:23,300
I called to ask him about
moving to the US.

227
00:20:23,640 --> 00:20:25,600
I’m not sure if he’d go with us.

228
00:20:26,100 --> 00:20:29,600
If you see him, can you ask him for me?

229
00:20:29,730 --> 00:20:31,750
Sure, I’ll let you know.

230
00:20:32,090 --> 00:20:33,100
I won’t take any more of your time.

231
00:20:33,400 --> 00:20:34,500
- Thank you so much.
- No problem.

232
00:20:43,400 --> 00:20:44,500
Don’t worry.

233
00:20:45,240 --> 00:20:47,050
Pokpong might be at work.

234
00:20:47,590 --> 00:20:48,750
Let’s go check.

235
00:20:54,730 --> 00:20:55,310
Hi.

236
00:20:56,200 --> 00:20:56,850
Hi.

237
00:21:03,580 --> 00:21:06,100
Oh my god, Dr. Mekhin!

238
00:21:06,790 --> 00:21:08,010
Where have you been?

239
00:21:08,030 --> 00:21:09,700
We’ve missed you so much.

240
00:21:10,340 --> 00:21:12,300
I was sick, so I took some time off.

241
00:21:12,600 --> 00:21:15,370
Oh, no. Please take care of yourself.

242
00:21:15,400 --> 00:21:17,380
You’re a doctor. Don’t get sick.

243
00:21:17,830 --> 00:21:20,520
Everyone has been asking about you.

244
00:21:20,540 --> 00:21:22,330
Both the patients and the nurses.

245
00:21:22,880 --> 00:21:23,700
Really?

246
00:21:25,320 --> 00:21:26,400
Can I have some?

247
00:21:32,750 --> 00:21:33,650
Thank you.

248
00:21:43,650 --> 00:21:44,900
Excuse me.

249
00:21:45,310 --> 00:21:46,900
Did Pokpong not come to work today?

250
00:21:47,460 --> 00:21:49,100
He quit.

251
00:21:51,070 --> 00:21:51,700
What?

252
00:21:52,390 --> 00:21:53,380
He quit?

253
00:21:53,470 --> 00:21:54,010
Yes.

254
00:21:56,840 --> 00:22:01,500
What? Pokpong is your younger brother?

255
00:22:03,620 --> 00:22:04,300
Yes.

256
00:22:07,010 --> 00:22:09,100
The human world is really small, isn’t it?

257
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:12,700
You know Pokpong?

258
00:22:12,900 --> 00:22:13,550
Yes.

259
00:22:14,950 --> 00:22:16,300
How long have you known him?

260
00:22:17,030 --> 00:22:19,400
Well, I’ve known him for a while.

261
00:22:19,890 --> 00:22:22,880
I buy snacks there often.

262
00:22:22,910 --> 00:22:23,700
Mmm.

263
00:22:23,800 --> 00:22:27,200
So we started chatting here and there
and became friends

264
00:22:27,670 --> 00:22:28,700
I enjoy talking to him.

265
00:22:33,340 --> 00:22:35,300
I’ve never known anything
about my brother.

266
00:22:41,520 --> 00:22:42,700
Honestly, Punn.

267
00:22:43,580 --> 00:22:46,900
I don’t even know
what Ciar and Methus like to eat.

268
00:22:57,310 --> 00:22:58,900
Thank you so much, Mr. Mekhin,

269
00:22:59,920 --> 00:23:02,000
for keeping Pokpong company.

270
00:23:02,960 --> 00:23:04,300
He’s a lonely kid.

271
00:23:05,330 --> 00:23:06,650
He doesn’t have many friends.

272
00:23:08,740 --> 00:23:11,300
But this one is a lazy kid.

273
00:23:11,560 --> 00:23:12,200
Master!

274
00:23:17,550 --> 00:23:20,700
I’m going to talk to the shop owner.

275
00:23:34,080 --> 00:23:35,950
Speaking of Ciar,

276
00:23:39,060 --> 00:23:40,600
have you seen him at all?

277
00:23:41,920 --> 00:23:42,750
Not at all.

278
00:23:43,820 --> 00:23:45,000
I haven’t been able to reach him.

279
00:23:45,780 --> 00:23:49,200
I’m so worried about him.

280
00:23:49,600 --> 00:23:52,010
I don’t know what he’s thinking.

281
00:23:52,910 --> 00:23:55,050
I thought I knew him well,

282
00:23:55,980 --> 00:23:59,100
but sometimes I don’t know
what’s on his mind.

283
00:24:01,170 --> 00:24:04,650
Hey, but if you’re going to find him,

284
00:24:05,790 --> 00:24:08,300
don’t do anything risky, got it?

285
00:24:09,040 --> 00:24:09,800
Yes, Master.

286
00:24:10,500 --> 00:24:12,130
I don’t like having problems
with anyone anyway.

287
00:24:15,490 --> 00:24:19,600
By the way, you smell like blood.

288
00:24:20,810 --> 00:24:21,900
Doesn’t it affect you at all?

289
00:24:24,380 --> 00:24:26,400
It does, but I can control myself...

290
00:24:27,270 --> 00:24:29,700
by coming outside
and having a snack like this.

291
00:24:32,450 --> 00:24:33,350
Would you like to try some?

292
00:24:37,050 --> 00:24:42,600
What kind of food does
a 100-plus-year-old vampire eat?

293
00:24:45,130 --> 00:24:48,650
I eat…uh…

294
00:24:50,330 --> 00:24:51,210
Steamed buns.

295
00:24:52,970 --> 00:24:53,710
Steamed buns?

296
00:24:53,890 --> 00:24:54,450
Yeah.

297
00:24:54,960 --> 00:24:56,000
Why steamed buns?

298
00:24:57,570 --> 00:24:58,700
Punn bought them for me.

299
00:25:00,900 --> 00:25:02,500
Your heart belongs to the steamed buns.

300
00:25:06,250 --> 00:25:07,200
What are you talking about?

301
00:25:07,740 --> 00:25:08,340
Nothing.

302
00:25:11,360 --> 00:25:12,450
Would you like some grape juice instead?

303
00:25:13,400 --> 00:25:14,350
No.

304
00:25:22,920 --> 00:25:24,390
What did you talk to the shop owner about?

305
00:25:26,500 --> 00:25:30,500
I asked him if Pong had any problems
while he was working here,

306
00:25:31,770 --> 00:25:33,100
but he doesn’t know,

307
00:25:33,450 --> 00:25:35,350
because they weren’t here
at the same time.

308
00:25:35,980 --> 00:25:37,090
They didn’t really get to see each other.

309
00:25:38,860 --> 00:25:40,100
Pong won’t call me back.

310
00:25:41,070 --> 00:25:43,000
Who knows if he’s gotten himself
in trouble again?

311
00:25:44,950 --> 00:25:45,900
My crazy brother.

312
00:25:53,630 --> 00:25:54,200
Here.

313
00:25:55,830 --> 00:25:57,100
You eat this kind of thing?

314
00:25:58,230 --> 00:25:59,800
My crazy brother gave it to me.

315
00:26:00,640 --> 00:26:01,250
Have some.

316
00:26:15,500 --> 00:26:16,100
Eat this

317
00:26:16,940 --> 00:26:17,800
Open your mouth.

318
00:26:18,730 --> 00:26:19,400
Ah.

319
00:26:31,280 --> 00:26:34,800
I haven’t seen him
since he got suspended from school.

320
00:26:35,250 --> 00:26:37,100
Have you contacted or called him at all?

321
00:26:38,730 --> 00:26:39,600
Have I called him?

322
00:26:41,180 --> 00:26:43,500
The day before yesterday, I called
to ask him to play a game with me,

323
00:26:43,670 --> 00:26:44,700
but he didn’t answer.

324
00:26:44,880 --> 00:26:46,420
When I texted him, this was his reply.

325
00:26:48,800 --> 00:26:51,000
WHY DIDN’T YOU PICK UP MY CALLS?
JOIN ME IN THE GAME.

326
00:26:51,000 --> 00:26:53,610
NOT A GOOD TIME.
I’M SLEEPING OVER AT MY PARTNER’S.

327
00:26:55,900 --> 00:26:57,350
I guess he’s secretly dating someone.

328
00:26:57,700 --> 00:27:00,100
It’s okay. He’ll get back to you.

329
00:27:02,800 --> 00:27:03,800
I have to go. Bye.

330
00:27:04,910 --> 00:27:05,710
Thank you so much.

331
00:27:10,990 --> 00:27:12,700
Could he really be dating someone

332
00:27:12,800 --> 00:27:14,300
and that’s why
he just disappeared like this?

333
00:27:14,450 --> 00:27:16,000
Do you want to look somewhere else?

334
00:27:19,880 --> 00:27:21,300
I can’t think of anywhere else.

335
00:27:21,950 --> 00:27:22,850
Let’s go home.

336
00:27:23,570 --> 00:27:24,850
You must be tired.

337
00:27:27,630 --> 00:27:28,200
Let’s go.

338
00:27:29,540 --> 00:27:30,300
Wait, Punn.

339
00:27:32,450 --> 00:27:33,500
Let’s play the claw machine.

340
00:27:34,330 --> 00:27:35,000
- Come on.
- Huh?

341
00:27:35,920 --> 00:27:36,910
Let’s play the claw machine.

342
00:27:38,740 --> 00:27:40,590
I’m definitely going to win this time.

343
00:27:41,650 --> 00:27:42,990
Come on. Let’s play this.

344
00:27:46,740 --> 00:27:47,960
Let me help.

345
00:27:49,220 --> 00:27:50,800
I think we should get this one.

346
00:27:51,440 --> 00:27:52,200
Let’s get this one.

347
00:27:52,470 --> 00:27:53,100
Okay.

348
00:27:55,140 --> 00:27:55,710
Yes!

349
00:27:57,560 --> 00:27:58,700
No!

350
00:28:02,540 --> 00:28:04,310
Ready? I’m going to press the button.

351
00:28:06,290 --> 00:28:08,600
- What? You pressed it already?
- Here we go.

352
00:28:10,350 --> 00:28:11,400
Yay!

353
00:28:12,880 --> 00:28:13,500
Hey.

354
00:28:15,860 --> 00:28:17,800
I told you I’d win the doll this time.

355
00:28:18,590 --> 00:28:19,800
How’s this possible?

356
00:28:22,130 --> 00:28:22,800
I got it.

357
00:28:23,060 --> 00:28:24,300
Can I try again?

358
00:28:27,240 --> 00:28:29,300
Get one more so we can match.

359
00:28:31,110 --> 00:28:34,000
No! We’ve used up the coins.

360
00:28:43,210 --> 00:28:45,050
Here. This is yours.

361
00:28:46,890 --> 00:28:49,100
It’s okay. We can just have one.

362
00:28:50,590 --> 00:28:51,310
Alright then.

363
00:28:51,790 --> 00:28:53,010
I want to go home now.

364
00:28:53,350 --> 00:28:53,910
Let’s go.

365
00:29:04,080 --> 00:29:07,210
MICHAEL ORPHANAGE

366
00:29:29,280 --> 00:29:32,900
Hello, are you here
to treat the kids to a meal?

367
00:29:33,470 --> 00:29:36,800
They’ve already eaten and gone
to their rooms for their afternoon nap.

368
00:29:37,210 --> 00:29:40,400
Hello. I was just passing by
and thought I’d come in and see.

369
00:29:41,130 --> 00:29:42,700
How long has this place been here?

370
00:29:43,000 --> 00:29:47,290
Almost 10 years,
but I only moved here a few years ago.

371
00:29:47,690 --> 00:29:50,000
But the building looks like it’s been
here much longer than that.

372
00:29:50,080 --> 00:29:50,800
You’re right.

373
00:29:51,150 --> 00:29:53,300
Something terrible happened here.

374
00:29:55,090 --> 00:29:56,500
What happened?

375
00:29:57,300 --> 00:30:00,200
No one here wants to talk about it,

376
00:30:01,140 --> 00:30:05,700
even though Father Dracul
survived the incident.

377
00:30:06,490 --> 00:30:07,700
I’m sorry to hear that,

378
00:30:09,000 --> 00:30:12,300
but who’s Father Dracul?

379
00:30:13,240 --> 00:30:18,400
He’s the priest who owns this orphanage.

380
00:30:21,110 --> 00:30:23,700
And you said he survived?

381
00:30:24,880 --> 00:30:27,400
He survived along with three kids.

382
00:30:28,120 --> 00:30:29,900
They’ve all split up now.

383
00:30:31,100 --> 00:30:36,050
Father was badly injured in the incident
and is now bedridden.

384
00:30:36,480 --> 00:30:41,600
He’s being cared for here
by Sister Teresa.

385
00:30:43,210 --> 00:30:46,200
Sister, can I visit him?

386
00:30:47,850 --> 00:30:49,200
I’m afraid that’s not a good idea.

387
00:30:50,060 --> 00:30:52,200
He’s unconscious.

388
00:30:53,400 --> 00:30:54,100
Is that so?

389
00:30:55,470 --> 00:30:58,500
In that case, may I know his name again?

390
00:30:59,290 --> 00:31:01,000
I’ve been looking for someone.

391
00:31:01,310 --> 00:31:02,800
I want to know if it’s the same person.

392
00:31:04,580 --> 00:31:07,300
You won’t find him on the internet.

393
00:31:08,120 --> 00:31:10,400
He doesn’t like having his photos taken.

394
00:31:13,710 --> 00:31:14,350
Oh,

395
00:31:15,590 --> 00:31:16,950
but you can see what he looks like.

396
00:31:21,510 --> 00:31:25,400
There aren’t any photos,
but there’s a drawing of him.

397
00:31:32,460 --> 00:31:33,100
Here.

398
00:31:34,030 --> 00:31:35,900
This is Father Dracul.

399
00:31:39,600 --> 00:31:42,090
WINNALA ANTIQUE
BUYING, SELLING, REPAIR & CONSERVATION

400
00:31:53,610 --> 00:31:54,850
You must be tired today.

401
00:31:56,510 --> 00:31:57,410
Aren’t you?

402
00:31:59,020 --> 00:32:00,400
I’m a vampire.

403
00:32:00,730 --> 00:32:02,100
I don’t get tired that easily.

404
00:32:07,360 --> 00:32:08,800
I’ve probably been tired
from everything lately.

405
00:32:10,230 --> 00:32:12,310
Ever since Jett and the others
stormed into the hotel,

406
00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:18,100
so many things happened
and there’s been a lot to think about.

407
00:32:29,910 --> 00:32:31,300
Humans are so complicated.

408
00:32:32,640 --> 00:32:33,300
Why?

409
00:32:34,250 --> 00:32:36,500
Are you saying vampires
don’t have much to think about?

410
00:32:39,940 --> 00:32:41,450
It’s because you’re still alive, Punn.

411
00:33:02,710 --> 00:33:03,800
You still have flesh,

412
00:33:05,800 --> 00:33:06,800
feelings,

413
00:33:08,900 --> 00:33:10,100
and breath.

414
00:33:13,600 --> 00:33:15,300
I was born as a vampire.

415
00:33:16,270 --> 00:33:20,200
I don’t know what it’s like to breathe.

416
00:33:48,680 --> 00:33:52,710
Having a beating heart
is so exciting, Punn.

417
00:33:56,290 --> 00:33:59,700
Whether it beats fast or slow...

418
00:34:02,240 --> 00:34:04,200
depends on your feelings at the moment.

419
00:34:08,230 --> 00:34:11,900
Everything you feel is because
you're still alive.

420
00:34:26,989 --> 00:34:31,800
I’m sorry I killed your clan members
in the past.

421
00:34:43,090 --> 00:34:47,600
Do you hate me for lying to you?

422
00:34:50,010 --> 00:34:51,900
Do you hate me for being a hunter?

423
00:34:55,639 --> 00:34:56,800
I think...

424
00:34:58,840 --> 00:35:00,400
I’ll have to ask my boss.

425
00:35:04,040 --> 00:35:05,100
What boss?

426
00:35:06,720 --> 00:35:07,890
Hmm…

427
00:35:09,620 --> 00:35:11,800
This is him. He’s my boss.

428
00:35:17,000 --> 00:35:18,250
What a goofy vampire.

429
00:35:21,640 --> 00:35:22,200
Chomp.

430
00:35:25,830 --> 00:35:26,700
Does he look like me?

431
00:35:28,350 --> 00:35:29,310
Does he?

432
00:35:31,510 --> 00:35:32,300
No.

433
00:35:33,270 --> 00:35:34,300
Agreed.

434
00:35:35,900 --> 00:35:37,000
I’m more handsome.

435
00:35:51,200 --> 00:35:51,800
Here.

436
00:35:52,280 --> 00:35:53,500
There’s something even spicier than this.

437
00:35:53,790 --> 00:35:54,700
It’s called Mala.

438
00:35:59,560 --> 00:36:00,290
Ma?

439
00:36:00,860 --> 00:36:03,600
Not “Ma” like a dog.

440
00:36:09,190 --> 00:36:10,000
Give me your hand.

441
00:36:11,250 --> 00:36:12,500
I’m not a dog.

442
00:36:15,060 --> 00:36:15,750
No water for you.

443
00:36:15,790 --> 00:36:17,080
Hey!

444
00:36:18,200 --> 00:36:19,400
Do you even know how to wash the dishes?

445
00:36:20,050 --> 00:36:21,300
- Have you squeezed out the dish soap?
- Of course!

446
00:36:27,670 --> 00:36:28,700
Is that a steamed bun?

447
00:36:29,830 --> 00:36:30,700
No, it’s a steamed Punn.

448
00:36:31,770 --> 00:36:34,700
Hey, if you make a mess,
you’ll have to clean it up yourself.

449
00:36:37,720 --> 00:36:38,780
Ouch! It got in my eye!

450
00:36:38,840 --> 00:36:39,750
It got in my eye!

451
00:36:40,560 --> 00:36:41,410
- Punn!
- Here?

452
00:36:41,430 --> 00:36:42,100
Yes.

453
00:36:43,690 --> 00:36:44,290
Hey!

454
00:36:49,800 --> 00:36:50,700
You wanna play, huh?

455
00:36:50,880 --> 00:36:51,600
Bring it.

456
00:36:59,650 --> 00:37:00,500
Let’s wash the dishes.

457
00:37:01,870 --> 00:37:04,100
You’re supposed to wash the dishes,
not make bubbles.

458
00:37:06,650 --> 00:37:07,700
Do you know how to brush your teeth?

459
00:37:07,930 --> 00:37:09,700
This is how you do it.

460
00:37:10,900 --> 00:37:13,400
You have to brush up and down like this.

461
00:37:15,960 --> 00:37:16,800
No!

462
00:37:17,060 --> 00:37:18,800
- You don’t have to shake your head.
- Oh?

463
00:37:19,440 --> 00:37:20,800
Just brush with your hand like this.

464
00:37:23,330 --> 00:37:23,910
Hey.

465
00:37:26,540 --> 00:37:27,220
Like this?

466
00:37:40,400 --> 00:37:44,700
I feel like I’m older than
everything here.

467
00:37:47,190 --> 00:37:48,500
That’s probably true.

468
00:37:49,830 --> 00:37:54,200
I opened this shop
because I like old things.

469
00:38:01,810 --> 00:38:02,610
What about you?

470
00:38:04,270 --> 00:38:05,300
Do you like me?

471
00:38:07,220 --> 00:38:08,110
Of course I do.

472
00:38:09,850 --> 00:38:11,200
Since when?

473
00:38:24,360 --> 00:38:27,000
Since you released me from the painting.

474
00:38:28,740 --> 00:38:31,200
I thought I was going to
dry up and die in there.

475
00:38:39,280 --> 00:38:42,200
What about you? When did you fall for me?

476
00:38:45,660 --> 00:38:46,900
I’m not sure.

477
00:38:48,360 --> 00:38:51,600
Since the first time we met
inside the painting?

478
00:38:54,210 --> 00:38:58,000
Actually, I feel like I’ve met you before.

479
00:38:59,790 --> 00:39:01,700
I’ve dreamed about you so often...

480
00:39:03,790 --> 00:39:05,700
that I thought it was really you.

481
00:39:08,750 --> 00:39:10,000
The man in my dreams

482
00:39:11,920 --> 00:39:13,800
even wears the same necklace as you.

483
00:39:19,710 --> 00:39:23,700
Is it possible that you’re the man
I’ve been dreaming about?

484
00:39:26,210 --> 00:39:32,900
Is it possible that you’re the one
I’ve been searching for all this time?

485
00:39:43,190 --> 00:39:48,100

00:40:21,190 --> 00:40:25,700
Pokpong, this is Punn’s real workplace.

493
00:40:31,040 --> 00:40:33,200
Why are you acting like
it’s some big secret?

494
00:40:36,800 --> 00:40:38,600
You saw the hidden room in Punn’s house.

495
00:40:39,130 --> 00:40:42,600
Do you think his work is a secret?

496
00:40:44,120 --> 00:40:45,800
How long are you going to keep my phone?

497
00:40:45,960 --> 00:40:46,700
It’s the rule.

498
00:40:47,980 --> 00:40:50,200
I already asked for your permission

499
00:40:51,980 --> 00:40:53,700
and you agreed in exchange
for Punn’s story.

500
00:41:11,960 --> 00:41:14,600
Sis, why are you so moody?

501
00:41:15,290 --> 00:41:17,650
People have errands to run. It’s normal.

502
00:41:17,670 --> 00:41:18,280
Yeah.

503
00:41:18,490 --> 00:41:22,430
I wouldn’t be moody if Jett told me
what errand he’s on.

504
00:41:22,680 --> 00:41:24,700
I’m worried he might
do something risky again.

505
00:41:24,820 --> 00:41:26,400
He’s been acting weird lately.

506
00:41:26,940 --> 00:41:29,540
Sis, you don’t have to worry.

507
00:41:29,690 --> 00:41:32,500
Jett just found a new way
to deal with the vampires.

508
00:41:36,380 --> 00:41:37,210
What way?

509
00:41:39,280 --> 00:41:41,000
Did you guys invent a new weapon for him?

510
00:41:42,200 --> 00:41:44,550
Just wait and see, sis.

511
00:41:45,370 --> 00:41:47,900
This weapon is like a hack.

512
00:41:48,630 --> 00:41:53,090
Whether it’s a human or a vampire,
they all die because of love.

513
00:41:53,980 --> 00:41:54,870
What do you think?

514
00:41:54,900 --> 00:41:55,910
What do you think, sis?

515
00:42:09,910 --> 00:42:12,200
Hey, are you shocked?

516
00:42:13,390 --> 00:42:14,900
Does Punn really work here?

517
00:42:15,520 --> 00:42:16,800
Why would I lie to you?

518
00:42:17,500 --> 00:42:19,700
Punn and I grew up together.

519
00:42:20,320 --> 00:42:21,550
We built this place together.

520
00:42:24,410 --> 00:42:27,230
Hey, Jett. Why did you come to
the base alone today?

521
00:42:27,270 --> 00:42:28,100
Where are the others?

522
00:42:28,310 --> 00:42:29,500
They’re busy with other things.

523
00:42:30,540 --> 00:42:31,700
Long time no see.

524
00:42:32,420 --> 00:42:34,250
How was the mission
to investigate vampires abroad?

525
00:42:34,280 --> 00:42:35,110
Did everything go well?

526
00:42:35,160 --> 00:42:36,000
Yeah, it went well.

527
00:42:36,190 --> 00:42:38,100
Is it true that Punn is staying
with the vampires?

528
00:42:38,690 --> 00:42:39,900
I’m busy.

529
00:42:40,660 --> 00:42:41,700
Let’s talk next time.

530
00:42:48,370 --> 00:42:50,700
Is your story about vampires true?

531
00:42:52,290 --> 00:42:53,600
Why would I lie to you?

532
00:42:58,210 --> 00:43:03,900
The Hunters’ job is
to annihilate those vampires.

533
00:43:08,320 --> 00:43:10,300
You don’t have to believe
the supernatural stuff yet,

534
00:43:11,300 --> 00:43:14,200
but Punn is being held by them.

535
00:43:14,420 --> 00:43:15,200
That’s true.

536
00:43:17,360 --> 00:43:18,800
Why did they capture him?

537
00:43:19,730 --> 00:43:23,400
He was sent to investigate them,
but they caught him.

538
00:43:24,760 --> 00:43:27,220
The other day, the other Hunters and I
stormed into their place.

539
00:43:29,490 --> 00:43:30,600
They must be very angry.

540
00:43:30,970 --> 00:43:32,810
They took Punn away without a trace.

541
00:43:34,160 --> 00:43:36,650
But I believe that Punn is still alive.

542
00:43:37,880 --> 00:43:39,300
He’s still useful to them.

543
00:43:39,840 --> 00:43:41,300
When are you going
to break in there again?

544
00:43:42,040 --> 00:43:42,700
Why?

545
00:43:44,110 --> 00:43:45,550
You want to join us?

546
00:43:46,100 --> 00:43:48,000
Punn is my only family left.

547
00:43:51,980 --> 00:43:53,510
Can I join the Hunters?

548
00:43:55,660 --> 00:43:57,500
Just let me help rescue him,
that’s all I ask.

549
00:44:08,330 --> 00:44:09,250
Is everything alright?

550
00:44:09,760 --> 00:44:12,090
I went to find clues about the Hunters.

551
00:44:14,960 --> 00:44:15,660
Mr. Punn,

552
00:44:16,960 --> 00:44:18,290
please stay and listen too.

553
00:44:22,540 --> 00:44:23,290
Okay.

554
00:44:40,730 --> 00:44:43,500
You know the person in the drawing?

555
00:44:49,510 --> 00:44:50,900
How did you get this drawing?

556
00:44:51,850 --> 00:44:53,500
When I was out looking for information

557
00:44:54,190 --> 00:44:56,400
about why the Hunters want to get rid of us,

558
00:44:57,110 --> 00:44:59,100
I went to the Michael Orphanage.

559
00:44:59,630 --> 00:45:00,750
You went there?

560
00:45:02,070 --> 00:45:04,290
Yes, I did.

561
00:45:04,950 --> 00:45:07,490
And I got this drawing of the priest
who owns that place.

562
00:45:08,840 --> 00:45:09,600
The priest?

563
00:45:10,060 --> 00:45:10,810
Why?

564
00:45:11,680 --> 00:45:13,710
What does Father Dracul
have to do with this?

565
00:45:15,280 --> 00:45:16,890
How do you guys know about him?

566
00:45:17,500 --> 00:45:22,800
I only remember
that he died in the incident.

567
00:45:23,930 --> 00:45:25,500
No, he didn’t, Mr. Punn.

568
00:45:26,720 --> 00:45:30,200
I just found out
that Father Dracul is alive.

569
00:45:33,810 --> 00:45:36,810
Feratu, my younger half-brother
from a different mother.

570
00:45:37,650 --> 00:45:40,600
After being expelled from the family,
he disappeared.

571
00:45:41,530 --> 00:45:44,300
I think he’s Father Dracul,

572
00:45:45,350 --> 00:45:50,600
the owner of the orphanage
where you lived.

573
00:45:54,140 --> 00:45:54,800
Yes.

574
00:46:07,760 --> 00:46:12,900
Tonight, we’ll teach them
not to mess with the vampires again!

575
00:46:13,950 --> 00:46:14,500
Nom, nom.

576
00:46:15,010 --> 00:46:15,610
Come on.
