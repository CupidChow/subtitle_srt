Viewer discretion is advised.

5
00:00:17,180 --> 00:00:18,620
But you’re a vampire.

6
00:00:18,640 --> 00:00:19,700
You’re immortal.

7
00:00:20,050 --> 00:00:21,440
How could you possibly understand?

8
00:00:22,660 --> 00:00:24,190
You should go, Mr. Ramil.

9
00:00:24,220 --> 00:00:25,860
Go back to your duties.

10
00:00:26,580 --> 00:00:28,100
Let’s not see each other again.

11
00:00:29,480 --> 00:00:32,420
Between a human and a vampire, it’s impossible.

12
00:00:35,760 --> 00:00:36,710
I’m ready.

13
00:00:37,340 --> 00:00:39,000
Yes, Master.

14
00:01:00,080 --> 00:01:01,040
Follow me.

15
00:01:17,720 --> 00:01:19,020
Where are you taking me?

16
00:01:19,060 --> 00:01:20,760
You’re in danger.

17
00:01:21,180 --> 00:01:22,780
I’m taking you out of here.

18
00:01:26,460 --> 00:01:27,960
Please, Mr. Ramil.

19
00:01:28,580 --> 00:01:29,780
Just follow me.

20
00:01:31,780 --> 00:01:33,780
This is my territory.

21
00:01:34,820 --> 00:01:36,070
I’m not going anywhere.

22
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:00,770
Now,

23
00:02:01,020 --> 00:02:03,020
will you give in and come with me?

24
00:02:04,650 --> 00:02:09,759
If you promise to let me kiss you again,

25
00:02:12,580 --> 00:02:13,580
I will.

26
00:02:14,330 --> 00:02:15,590
I promise.

27
00:02:19,310 --> 00:02:21,520
Tell me what’s going on.

28
00:02:23,730 --> 00:02:28,300
The Hunters have planned to kill you
during the inauguration ceremony tonight.

29
00:02:28,740 --> 00:02:29,900
You’re not safe.

30
00:02:30,350 --> 00:02:31,940
I can’t let you die.

31
00:02:40,750 --> 00:02:41,790
Mr. Ramil!

32
00:04:29,900 --> 00:04:32,060
2 HOURS EARLIER

33
00:04:32,100 --> 00:04:33,340
This is our plan for tonight.

34
00:04:33,360 --> 00:04:35,800
We’ll divide into two teams.

35
00:04:37,050 --> 00:04:40,420
The first team will be ready with weapons,

36
00:04:40,460 --> 00:04:43,150
waiting for my and Elise’s orders outside.

37
00:04:43,820 --> 00:04:47,980
The second team will be led
by Paul and Caster.

38
00:04:50,380 --> 00:04:51,380
Tonight,

39
00:04:51,880 --> 00:04:54,280
we’re going to infiltrate their party.

40
00:05:15,260 --> 00:05:17,300
What did you spray on me, idiot?

41
00:05:17,320 --> 00:05:19,040
It freaking stinks.

42
00:05:19,660 --> 00:05:21,910
That’s to help you disguise yourself,

43
00:05:21,960 --> 00:05:25,120
so the vampires won’t be able to smell you.

44
00:05:25,160 --> 00:05:26,380
That’s supposed to reduce the smell?

45
00:05:26,400 --> 00:05:27,320
Yeah.

46
00:05:27,360 --> 00:05:28,920
Are you sure you used the right bottle?

47
00:05:28,940 --> 00:05:30,460
It freaking stinks.

48
00:05:30,490 --> 00:05:32,740
I invented this new formula.

49
00:05:32,780 --> 00:05:35,520
No matter how good the vampires’ noses
are, they won’t be able to smell you.

50
00:05:38,610 --> 00:05:39,580
Why are you staring at me?

51
00:05:39,620 --> 00:05:40,830
Finish getting dressed.

52
00:05:42,900 --> 00:05:45,280
Damn, it freaking stinks.

53
00:05:45,300 --> 00:05:46,220
Come on.

54
00:06:19,980 --> 00:06:23,890
Tell every unit to stand by
and wait for my orders.

55
00:06:23,910 --> 00:06:24,550
Yes, sir.

56
00:06:25,800 --> 00:06:27,670
All units stand by and wait for orders.

57
00:06:27,700 --> 00:06:30,310
Repeat. All units stand by
and wait for orders.

58
00:06:44,950 --> 00:06:45,900
Follow me.

59
00:06:49,830 --> 00:06:51,580
(Jett, Punn barged into the party.)

60
00:06:56,380 --> 00:06:56,970
Hey.

61
00:07:07,270 --> 00:07:08,920
Hey, let’s go over there next.

62
00:07:18,510 --> 00:07:19,200
Hey!

63
00:07:20,720 --> 00:07:21,740
Mekhin!

64
00:07:25,100 --> 00:07:25,830
Mekhin!

65
00:07:26,420 --> 00:07:27,130
Mekhin!

66
00:07:27,390 --> 00:07:29,390
Come on, you quack doctor!

67
00:07:29,420 --> 00:07:30,820
Use your power to heal yourself.

68
00:07:31,160 --> 00:07:32,640
I’ve already used my power a lot.

69
00:07:33,080 --> 00:07:33,960
Slowly get up.

70
00:07:45,300 --> 00:07:47,200
You really messed with me last time

71
00:07:47,220 --> 00:07:48,900
when you stormed into my bar.

72
00:07:48,940 --> 00:07:50,990
Do you have any idea
how much I had to pay for the damages?

73
00:07:51,020 --> 00:07:52,620
And the economy sucks right now, you jerk!

74
00:08:11,620 --> 00:08:12,940
Ordinary humans like you

75
00:08:12,970 --> 00:08:15,140
can never defeat an immortal clan like us.

76
00:08:38,980 --> 00:08:40,190
It’s alright, Ciar.

77
00:08:40,580 --> 00:08:42,059
You rest with Mekhin.

78
00:08:42,539 --> 00:08:43,539
I’ll take it from here.

79
00:08:53,770 --> 00:08:55,780
Mr. Ramil, get yourself together.

80
00:09:01,380 --> 00:09:02,210
Mr. Ramil!

81
00:09:02,470 --> 00:09:03,460
Push yourself.

82
00:09:05,810 --> 00:09:06,380
Punn!

83
00:09:07,580 --> 00:09:08,170
Punn!

84
00:09:14,640 --> 00:09:15,780
Are you okay, Punn?

85
00:09:17,550 --> 00:09:18,520
I’m fine.

86
00:09:28,140 --> 00:09:29,180
Don’t kill them.

87
00:09:31,720 --> 00:09:34,780
Only if you let me use my powers on them.

88
00:09:35,360 --> 00:09:36,260
Go ahead.

89
00:10:17,320 --> 00:10:17,980
Punn,

90
00:10:18,500 --> 00:10:20,500
I only ordered them to drop their weapons

91
00:10:20,540 --> 00:10:21,740
and go home.

92
00:10:26,660 --> 00:10:27,380
Mr. Ramil,

93
00:10:27,800 --> 00:10:29,380
you can’t go in there.

94
00:10:30,140 --> 00:10:31,740
I won’t leave them.

95
00:10:33,740 --> 00:10:35,580
Jett will never stop

96
00:10:36,400 --> 00:10:38,000
until he kills you.

97
00:10:46,820 --> 00:10:47,990
It’s okay, Punn.

98
00:10:48,980 --> 00:10:50,460
Wait for me here.

99
00:10:51,480 --> 00:10:52,860
I’ll be back as soon as I can.

100
00:10:53,190 --> 00:10:54,690
No, I’m going with you.

101
00:11:34,180 --> 00:11:36,860
You’re too slow for a master of speed.

102
00:11:38,210 --> 00:11:39,020
Mr. Jett.

103
00:11:47,680 --> 00:11:49,770
Why welcome your guest with that face?

104
00:11:50,580 --> 00:11:52,580
Are you still upset about the painting?

105
00:11:54,300 --> 00:11:56,140
No need to beat around the bush
like last time.

106
00:11:56,510 --> 00:11:58,510
Just tell me what you want.

107
00:12:01,780 --> 00:12:03,210
It’s not you I want to talk to.

108
00:12:04,100 --> 00:12:05,540
Then talk to me.

109
00:12:10,020 --> 00:12:12,020
We’ve never had any problems before.

110
00:12:13,070 --> 00:12:16,040
Why are you killing
so many of my clan members?

111
00:12:16,060 --> 00:12:18,580
Please don’t act like a hero
who’s never had blood on your hands.

112
00:12:18,900 --> 00:12:22,770
Vampires have been hunting humans
and drinking their blood forever.

113
00:12:22,790 --> 00:12:24,050
The race that exploits

114
00:12:24,360 --> 00:12:28,780
and kills people needs to be wiped out.

115
00:12:28,820 --> 00:12:31,270
How is that different from
humans hunting animals for food?

116
00:12:31,310 --> 00:12:32,910
Shut up, butler.

117
00:12:33,940 --> 00:12:35,200
I’m not talking to you.

118
00:12:37,620 --> 00:12:39,620
You must have a personal grudge
against me.

119
00:12:45,190 --> 00:12:46,380
What did you tell him now?

120
00:12:46,400 --> 00:12:47,770
I figured it out on my own.

121
00:12:52,190 --> 00:12:53,720
Punn never wanted to betray you guys.

122
00:12:53,750 --> 00:12:55,400
If he hadn’t betrayed me,

123
00:12:56,170 --> 00:12:57,590
you wouldn’t be standing here.

124
00:12:58,980 --> 00:13:00,550
It’s all your fault, Punn.

125
00:13:01,390 --> 00:13:02,830
You didn’t kill Ramil,

126
00:13:03,280 --> 00:13:04,470
so I’m going to kill him myself.

127
00:13:04,500 --> 00:13:05,140
No, Punn!

128
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:08,320
You still want to help him?

129
00:13:08,370 --> 00:13:09,740
I’m not sure.

130
00:13:12,480 --> 00:13:13,750
About what?

131
00:13:15,860 --> 00:13:20,980
The timing. Mr. Ramil was trapped
inside the painting for a hundred years.

132
00:13:21,980 --> 00:13:24,420
How could he have killed everyone
at the Michael Orphanage?

133
00:13:24,980 --> 00:13:26,980
That was 10 years ago.

134
00:13:29,110 --> 00:13:32,740
But you’re the one who told me
about that necklace.

135
00:13:33,580 --> 00:13:35,730
I told you I saw the necklace before,

136
00:13:37,730 --> 00:13:39,970
but I’m not sure if it was him that night

137
00:13:41,630 --> 00:13:43,300
and I’m not even sure

138
00:13:44,310 --> 00:13:46,160
what really went down.

139
00:13:48,310 --> 00:13:50,310
Neither are you guys.

140
00:13:52,680 --> 00:13:54,130
We were children.

141
00:13:54,630 --> 00:14:00,940
Our memories as children
could be wrong, Jett.

142
00:14:02,530 --> 00:14:03,370
Isn’t that right?

143
00:14:05,060 --> 00:14:05,920
Isn’t that right, Elise?

144
00:14:05,950 --> 00:14:07,350
Stop stalling for time.

145
00:14:08,620 --> 00:14:10,300
You may have misunderstood,

146
00:14:11,370 --> 00:14:13,580
but I founded the Hunters to kill them.

147
00:14:14,190 --> 00:14:15,580
If you don’t move,

148
00:14:16,680 --> 00:14:19,060
I’ll kill you along with them.

149
00:14:23,420 --> 00:14:24,650
Kill him, Elise!

150
00:14:28,580 --> 00:14:29,460
Mr. Ramil!

151
00:14:30,020 --> 00:14:30,660
Master!

152
00:14:34,660 --> 00:14:35,440
No!

153
00:14:40,920 --> 00:14:41,700
Master!

154
00:14:46,340 --> 00:14:48,140
I heard a lot of people coming this way.

155
00:14:48,530 --> 00:14:50,270
Can you use your power to heal yourself?

156
00:14:53,860 --> 00:14:57,780
Then can you help him escape, Mr. Punn?

157
00:14:58,100 --> 00:14:59,060
It’s not safe here.

158
00:14:59,310 --> 00:15:00,530
What about you, Methus?

159
00:15:01,420 --> 00:15:02,590
Don’t worry about me.

160
00:15:02,620 --> 00:15:04,140
I’ll buy you some time.

161
00:15:05,040 --> 00:15:07,180
Can you please go heal yourself
and hurry back?

162
00:15:09,210 --> 00:15:10,580
You mean you want me to go inside—

163
00:15:10,620 --> 00:15:11,290
Yes.

164
00:15:12,580 --> 00:15:14,580
Please help him, Mr. Punn.

165
00:15:24,020 --> 00:15:24,940
Mr. Ramil.

166
00:15:36,360 --> 00:15:37,330
Sit here.

167
00:15:44,050 --> 00:15:45,080
There he is!

168
00:15:55,010 --> 00:15:56,180
Mr. Ramil.

169
00:16:14,890 --> 00:16:15,980
Where did he go?

170
00:16:16,530 --> 00:16:17,490
I saw him just now.

171
00:16:20,500 --> 00:16:21,430
Hey!

172
00:16:25,860 --> 00:16:26,740
Mr. Ramil.

173
00:16:27,110 --> 00:16:28,100
Mr. Ramil, are you okay?

174
00:16:29,720 --> 00:16:31,720
The wound on your chest looks really bad.

175
00:16:33,720 --> 00:16:35,050
If I can’t take it anymore,

176
00:16:35,690 --> 00:16:37,050
will you carry me?

177
00:16:38,620 --> 00:16:40,340
Don’t joke, Mr. Ramil.

178
00:16:41,060 --> 00:16:43,060
I still don’t know where to take you next.

179
00:16:43,540 --> 00:16:44,900
Let’s get out of here.

180
00:16:45,800 --> 00:16:47,310
There’s a place in the forest.

181
00:16:49,930 --> 00:16:51,290
We’ll stay there.

182
00:17:11,290 --> 00:17:12,060
Mr. Ramil.

183
00:17:12,670 --> 00:17:13,569
Mr. Ramil.

184
00:18:06,510 --> 00:18:08,170
You seem to have a fever,

185
00:18:09,700 --> 00:18:11,540
but your body feels ice cold.

186
00:18:17,390 --> 00:18:18,910
I’m probably dying.

187
00:18:20,500 --> 00:18:21,280
No.

188
00:18:22,330 --> 00:18:23,870
I’m already dead.

189
00:18:25,720 --> 00:18:27,070
Don’t joke.

190
00:18:28,460 --> 00:18:30,070
I’m worried about you.

191
00:18:32,070 --> 00:18:34,900
I’m glad you’re worried about me.

192
00:18:36,900 --> 00:18:41,640
But I don’t like to see you in danger.

193
00:18:49,940 --> 00:18:54,380
These are the typical symptoms
of injured vampires.

194
00:18:56,380 --> 00:18:59,590
My body is cold because of the wound.

195
00:19:02,040 --> 00:19:05,500
But after that…

196
00:19:07,500 --> 00:19:08,780
What happens next?

197
00:19:10,160 --> 00:19:12,960
The fever will go down and I’ll recover.

198
00:19:16,270 --> 00:19:20,440
So that means I have to give you
a sponge bath to bring the fever down.

199
00:19:21,750 --> 00:19:23,170
Then you’ll recover, right?

200
00:19:26,230 --> 00:19:30,380
No, you have to cuddle me all night
so I can recover.

201
00:19:45,400 --> 00:19:47,280
Now get well soon.

202
00:19:49,420 --> 00:19:50,980
I’ll recover as soon as I can.

203
00:20:20,340 --> 00:20:22,680
I thought you said if I cuddled you all night, you’d get better.

204
00:20:24,260 --> 00:20:25,970
But you seem worse.

205
00:20:28,610 --> 00:20:30,340
You tossed and turned last night.

206
00:20:31,750 --> 00:20:33,300
I couldn’t cuddle you tightly.

207
00:20:41,630 --> 00:20:43,220
Come, let me cuddle you again.

208
00:21:04,030 --> 00:21:05,970
You don’t seem to be getting better.

209
00:21:06,500 --> 00:21:08,180
I’m sorry, Mr. Ramil,

210
00:21:09,720 --> 00:21:11,720
for being the cause of everything.

211
00:21:14,760 --> 00:21:16,370
Don’t blame yourself, Punn.

212
00:21:20,370 --> 00:21:24,410
We don’t know what caused this.

213
00:21:25,980 --> 00:21:27,730
But no matter what it is,

214
00:21:29,550 --> 00:21:31,790
we’ll resolve it together.

215
00:21:43,400 --> 00:21:49,070
I’m thinking of going into the forest to see
if there’s any herb that can ease your pain.

216
00:21:50,470 --> 00:21:51,970
If you’re going into the forest,

217
00:21:53,220 --> 00:21:54,920
please be careful.

218
00:21:56,700 --> 00:22:00,500
The Forest of Greenmoore
is no ordinary place.

219
00:22:01,850 --> 00:22:04,580
It’s a magical forest.

220
00:22:06,100 --> 00:22:10,760
It’s also where the woman who cursed
and trapped me inside the painting lives.

221
00:22:12,180 --> 00:22:15,890
She’s the Mother of Demons, Lilith.

222
00:25:06,630 --> 00:25:10,060
You shouldn’t touch other people’s stuff without permission.

223
00:25:20,570 --> 00:25:23,990
You don’t need to look for any herbs
in this forest.

224
00:25:25,800 --> 00:25:30,970
The Forest of Greenmoore doesn’t have
any plants that can cure a vampire’s fever.

225
00:25:32,410 --> 00:25:34,340
You know Mr. Ramil is injured.

226
00:25:35,600 --> 00:25:39,310
I see your future, Punn Winnala.

227
00:25:40,680 --> 00:25:42,680
You came here with him.

228
00:25:42,960 --> 00:25:44,200
I saw it coming.

229
00:26:01,980 --> 00:26:04,160
Can you cure Mr. Ramil?

230
00:26:05,980 --> 00:26:07,170
Not me,

231
00:26:08,080 --> 00:26:11,930
but his curse breaker, Punn Winnala.

232
00:26:13,580 --> 00:26:16,830
I’m only the spinner of the wheel of fate
between you and him.

233
00:26:16,850 --> 00:26:17,940
Nothing more.

234
00:26:21,000 --> 00:26:24,380
With the blood of his curse breaker
and the utterance of his name,

235
00:26:24,410 --> 00:26:26,820
the curse that has bound him shall vanish.

236
00:26:27,580 --> 00:26:32,650
His curse breaker will be
the one he loves for eternity.

237
00:26:33,480 --> 00:26:37,700
Do you know why I told Ramil
how to break the curse?

238
00:26:39,830 --> 00:26:41,670
Because he never had anyone
who loved him.

239
00:26:43,540 --> 00:26:45,580
He never loved anyone.

240
00:26:47,080 --> 00:26:50,900
When I cursed him, I knew

241
00:26:50,930 --> 00:26:52,780
he’d never be able to break it.

242
00:26:54,700 --> 00:26:57,000
But then I saw you in my vision,

243
00:26:59,310 --> 00:27:00,580
so…

244
00:27:00,990 --> 00:27:04,700
I decided to put myself on the line
with him and you.

245
00:27:10,250 --> 00:27:15,890
Only the blood of someone a vampire loves can break any curse placed upon them.

246
00:27:17,890 --> 00:27:22,360
So, it might be possible to cure him.

247
00:27:23,540 --> 00:27:25,540
Would you like to prove it?

248
00:27:26,950 --> 00:27:31,500
If it can save Mr. Ramil, I will try.

249
00:27:33,500 --> 00:27:36,680
In that case, let me give you a warning.

250
00:27:37,830 --> 00:27:41,980
An injured vampire might not be able
to control himself.

251
00:27:43,060 --> 00:27:45,880
If you want to prove the love
you have for each other,

252
00:27:46,350 --> 00:27:50,140
you may have to struggle
to survive against his instincts.

253
00:27:53,620 --> 00:27:54,580
Thank you.

254
00:28:02,580 --> 00:28:06,800
The Greenmoore you’re in right now

255
00:28:06,820 --> 00:28:09,770
is just a simulation inside
the painting I trapped Ramil in.

256
00:28:10,430 --> 00:28:12,850
Everything here is limitless.

257
00:28:13,980 --> 00:28:16,940
Time outside has no effect on this place.

258
00:28:17,690 --> 00:28:19,910
Here, everything is eternal.

259
00:28:21,790 --> 00:28:23,650
I see your future.

260
00:28:25,060 --> 00:28:27,550
This is just the beginning.

261
00:28:30,220 --> 00:28:35,360
But don’t worry. You two will pass this test.

262
00:28:38,760 --> 00:28:43,500
I wish you good luck, Punn Winnala.

263
00:28:55,800 --> 00:28:58,120
Thank you for setting me free.

264
00:30:00,670 --> 00:30:03,340
Punn, what happened?

265
00:30:16,500 --> 00:30:17,280
Mr. Ramil!

266
00:30:17,580 --> 00:30:18,460
Mr. Ramil!

267
00:30:18,710 --> 00:30:20,380
Mr. Ramil, open the door!

268
00:30:21,440 --> 00:30:24,480
Mr. Ramil, open the door and let me in!

269
00:30:25,140 --> 00:30:26,090
No!

270
00:30:27,010 --> 00:30:28,680
I don’t want to drink your blood.

271
00:30:29,790 --> 00:30:31,480
You have to let me in.

272
00:30:33,300 --> 00:30:34,460
I’m not afraid of you.

273
00:30:35,300 --> 00:30:37,300
No! No!

274
00:30:38,020 --> 00:30:39,250
I can’t do it.

275
00:30:42,710 --> 00:30:45,450
If you come near me, you’ll be in danger.

276
00:30:47,610 --> 00:30:48,920
No, Mr. Ramil.

277
00:30:49,700 --> 00:30:50,940
Leave me here.

278
00:30:51,430 --> 00:30:52,750
Run far away!

279
00:30:52,770 --> 00:30:54,200
No, Mr. Ramil.

280
00:30:54,980 --> 00:30:56,380
I’m not afraid of anything.

281
00:30:57,830 --> 00:30:59,380
You have to drink my blood.

282
00:30:59,410 --> 00:31:01,580
I can’t stop my thirst for blood.

283
00:31:03,580 --> 00:31:04,960
No, Mr. Ramil.

284
00:31:05,680 --> 00:31:07,820
I’m not leaving you!

285
00:31:08,990 --> 00:31:10,500
Open the door for me!

286
00:31:12,900 --> 00:31:14,900
I’m not leaving you!

287
00:32:58,380 --> 00:32:59,290
Mr. Ramil!

288
00:33:14,780 --> 00:33:15,180
Mr. Ramil!

289
00:33:15,220 --> 00:33:17,180
No, Mr. Ramil! Let go!

290
00:33:17,210 --> 00:33:18,700
Don’t, Mr. Ramil!

291
00:33:18,720 --> 00:33:19,860
Get yourself together!

292
00:33:19,900 --> 00:33:21,860
It’s me! Mr. Ramil!

293
00:33:37,060 --> 00:33:37,970
Mr. Ramil!

294
00:34:08,760 --> 00:34:09,330
Mr. Ramil!

295
00:34:11,550 --> 00:34:12,280
Mr. Ramil!

296
00:34:17,480 --> 00:34:17,900
Hey!

297
00:34:17,929 --> 00:34:18,820
Mr. Ramil!

298
00:34:21,020 --> 00:34:21,969
Mr. Ramil!

299
00:34:28,389 --> 00:34:29,219
Mr. Ramil!

300
00:34:43,949 --> 00:34:45,210
No matter what happens,

301
00:34:45,719 --> 00:34:47,159
I’ll protect you.

302
00:35:24,220 --> 00:35:27,180
Mr. Ramil, don’t do that.

303
00:35:36,010 --> 00:35:37,100
Don’t come any closer!

304
00:35:42,140 --> 00:35:43,170
Mr. Ramil.

305
00:35:53,580 --> 00:35:55,330
I’m here, Mr. Ramil.

306
00:35:56,740 --> 00:35:58,290
I’m not going anywhere.

307
00:36:12,270 --> 00:36:12,950
Punn.

308
00:36:13,760 --> 00:36:14,500
Punn!

309
00:36:15,470 --> 00:36:16,130
Punn!

310
00:36:17,520 --> 00:36:18,250
Punn!

311
00:36:19,890 --> 00:36:21,430
Punn, stay with me!

312
00:36:22,170 --> 00:36:23,140
Look at me, Punn!

313
00:36:23,160 --> 00:36:25,550
Wake up! Don’t fall asleep!

314
00:37:01,330 --> 00:37:02,860
I love you, Punn.

315
00:37:35,240 --> 00:37:37,580
I love you too, Mr. Ramil.

316
00:38:19,580 --> 00:38:20,250
Punn.

317
00:38:33,060 --> 00:38:34,260
I’m sorry.

318
00:38:36,210 --> 00:38:39,740
I couldn’t control myself
and ended up hurting you.

319
00:38:50,340 --> 00:38:51,330
It’s alright.

320
00:38:52,960 --> 00:38:54,360
Don’t feel guilty.

321
00:38:56,000 --> 00:38:59,620
I’m just glad you’re okay now.

322
00:39:11,620 --> 00:39:14,050
I’ve been waiting to hear those words
all along.

323
00:39:17,740 --> 00:39:19,100
What words?

324
00:39:23,220 --> 00:39:24,920
That you love me.

325
00:39:45,580 --> 00:39:48,900
I love you, Mr. Ramil.

326
00:39:55,400 --> 00:39:56,900
Let’s get out of here.

327
00:39:58,110 --> 00:39:59,890
I don’t want to run away
from problems anymore.

328
00:40:00,790 --> 00:40:02,790
I want to go back and face them.

329
00:40:04,610 --> 00:40:06,610
I want to make things right.

330
00:40:10,100 --> 00:40:13,460
And I want you, Mr. Ramil.

331
00:40:24,190 --> 00:40:27,620
Of course. I’ll go anywhere with you.

332
00:40:49,320 --> 00:40:53,370
Punn, no matter what happens from now on,

333
00:40:53,400 --> 00:40:57,560
I promise I won’t let go of your hand.

334
00:41:01,400 --> 00:41:03,400
I’ll stay by your side forever.

335
00:41:21,430 --> 00:41:23,990
WINNALA ANTIQUE BUYING, SELLING,
REPAIR & CONSERVATION

336
00:41:45,130 --> 00:41:45,860
Hey, Punn!

337
00:41:47,170 --> 00:41:47,860
Oh?

338
00:41:51,220 --> 00:41:52,740
Why did he leave the light on?

339
00:43:06,550 --> 00:43:09,780
(Sorry, it’s not possible to reach
the number you’ve dialed…)

340
00:43:24,500 --> 00:43:25,560
What do you think you’re doing?

341
00:43:26,380 --> 00:43:27,770
These vampires

342
00:43:27,810 --> 00:43:29,370
are my family!

343
00:43:31,130 --> 00:43:33,130
You’re my family too, Punn.

344
00:43:34,010 --> 00:43:37,500
I feel bad for being the reason you guys are fighting.

345
00:43:38,220 --> 00:43:39,590
We’ve talked about this.

346
00:43:40,640 --> 00:43:43,360
Pokpong hasn’t been home in a while.

347
00:43:43,380 --> 00:43:46,130
Have you called or contacted him at all?

348
00:43:46,500 --> 00:43:48,070
Did Pokpong not come to work today?
