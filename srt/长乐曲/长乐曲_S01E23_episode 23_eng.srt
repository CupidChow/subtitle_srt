00:00:27,840 --> 00:00:31,910
 "Go Ahead Fearlessly" - Liu Yuning 

3
00:00:31,910 --> 00:00:35,025
â™«  Grudges and karma, right and wrong  â™«

4
00:00:35,025 --> 00:00:38,223
â™«  The past hides blood and tears  â™«

5
00:00:38,223 --> 00:00:40,592
â™«  It is hard to catch up after years of separation  â™«

6
00:00:40,592 --> 00:00:44,567
â™«  The truth cannot be fully revealed  â™«

7
00:00:44,567 --> 00:00:47,602
â™«  Fate is full of twists and turns  â™«

8
00:00:47,602 --> 00:00:50,867
â™«  Life and death, fortune and misfortune go hand in hand  â™«

9
00:00:50,867 --> 00:00:55,903
â™«  Obsession is hard to get rid of, keeping the truth 
 and getting rid of the lies, let the wind blow  â™«

10
00:00:55,903 --> 00:01:02,175
â™«  Tossed about by the wind and rain, I will never regret it, 
 I will accompany you for my whole life  â™«

11
00:01:02,175 --> 00:01:08,383
â™«  At least you share my joy and sorrow  â™«

12
00:01:08,383 --> 00:01:14,762
â™«  Unravelling fate, fearlessly, a dream returns  â™«

13
00:01:14,762 --> 00:01:21,075
â™«  The mountains and rivers are bright and beautiful, 
 holding hands, together we return  â™«

14
00:01:21,075 --> 00:01:29,119
â™«  In this life, my heart returns untainted of dust and ash  â™«

15
00:01:29,119 --> 00:01:37,253
   

16
00:01:37,253 --> 00:01:40,260
   

17
00:01:41,220 --> 00:01:43,230
Pan?

18
00:01:43,230 --> 00:01:45,300
How come you're here?

19
00:01:45,980 --> 00:01:48,720
Chief Clerk Yan, long time no see!

20
00:01:51,360 --> 00:01:52,900
This is a key area for investigation.

21
00:01:52,900 --> 00:01:55,880
How can you let unrelated people enter at will?

22
00:01:55,880 --> 00:01:57,560
You have misunderstood, Great Chief.

23
00:01:57,560 --> 00:02:01,380
This person is the number one detective among the people, Master Pan Chi.

24
00:02:01,380 --> 00:02:04,440
He has come to assist me in the investigation.

25
00:02:04,440 --> 00:02:06,360
He is not an unrelated person.

26
00:02:06,360 --> 00:02:08,150
Great Chief Shen.

27
00:02:08,800 --> 00:02:11,660
Sure enough, the rumors are true.

28
00:02:11,660 --> 00:02:13,940
Pan is Pan Chi.

29
00:02:13,940 --> 00:02:18,260
You can always think of Pan as that Pan.

30
00:02:18,260 --> 00:02:19,920
I happened to come across this matter.

31
00:02:19,920 --> 00:02:22,580
The suspect's brother-in-law entrusted me to come here for the investigation.

32
00:02:22,580 --> 00:02:24,240
When this suspect was just arrested,

33
00:02:24,240 --> 00:02:27,150
he was clean as a whistle and had no murder weapon.

34
00:02:27,150 --> 00:02:30,660
I suspect he is very likely to have been wronged.

35
00:02:30,660 --> 00:02:34,340
It is written in the dossier that the victim's brother was not a martial artist.

36
00:02:34,340 --> 00:02:37,080
The likelihood of the brother committing the crime is very low.

37
00:02:37,080 --> 00:02:39,360
Based on the situation at the victim's home,

38
00:02:39,360 --> 00:02:41,380
it's highly likely a vendetta killing.

39
00:02:41,380 --> 00:02:42,640
The elder brother had a bad temper.

40
00:02:42,640 --> 00:02:45,700
Because of land disputes, he often quarreled with neighbors.

41
00:02:45,700 --> 00:02:48,700
He was once involved in a fight, and the matter was taken to the local official.

42
00:02:48,700 --> 00:02:52,700
In business, he often didn't get along with others and offended quite a few people.

43
00:02:52,700 --> 00:02:57,380
The murderer might take this opportunity to kill him and then frame the victim's brother.

44
00:02:57,380 --> 00:03:03,040
If it's a vendetta, the murderer and the victim must have had a deep hatred.

45
00:03:03,040 --> 00:03:06,280
Just killing would be one thing, but they took the victim's head.

46
00:03:06,280 --> 00:03:08,140
Why is that?

47
00:03:12,340 --> 00:03:17,080
Setting aside the motive for the crime can you deduce what kind of weapon was used?

48
00:03:17,080 --> 00:03:21,020
Governor Mo, there's no need to rush. Let us examine it carefully.

49
00:03:21,020 --> 00:03:23,120
Let's leave it at that for today.

50
00:03:25,260 --> 00:03:27,056
I'm hungry.

51
00:03:28,460 --> 00:03:30,184
Governor Mo.

52
00:03:41,060 --> 00:03:42,760
I'll take my leave.

53
00:03:51,601 --> 00:03:54,120
   

54
00:03:56,560 --> 00:04:00,500
Didn't you say to investigate the case first? How come you're suddenly hungry?

55
00:04:00,500 --> 00:04:04,240
Besides, we're not in Xiang'an right now. How come youâ€¦?

56
00:04:04,240 --> 00:04:06,600
Anyway, I'm hungry right now.

57
00:04:07,520 --> 00:04:10,960
Didn't you say you were going to make me a medicinal meal? Where is it?

58
00:04:10,960 --> 00:04:13,060
Make a medicinal meal?

59
00:04:14,260 --> 00:04:17,340
Are you sure you want me to use these hands?

60
00:04:18,720 --> 00:04:20,600
What's wrong?

61
00:04:21,480 --> 00:04:24,600
These are hands that have just examined a corpse.

62
00:04:24,600 --> 00:04:27,120
A medicinal meal made with these hands,

63
00:04:27,120 --> 00:04:29,820
are you sure you can stomach it?

64
00:04:29,820 --> 00:04:32,840
I can.

65
00:04:33,620 --> 00:04:36,180
Just wait.

66
00:04:54,040 --> 00:04:55,960
That's more like it.

67
00:04:55,960 --> 00:04:58,620
Look at him, not even preparing a welcome feast today.

68
00:04:58,620 --> 00:05:01,800
I was worried the stingy Governor Mo

69
00:05:01,800 --> 00:05:03,280
would also give us poor guest rooms to stay.

70
00:05:03,280 --> 00:05:05,900
Jing Lin, mind your words.

71
00:05:05,900 --> 00:05:07,600
Governor Mo is diligent and loves the people.

72
00:05:07,600 --> 00:05:10,260
He is a rare good official in the eyes of the people.

73
00:05:10,260 --> 00:05:12,320
It's just a welcome feast.

74
00:05:12,320 --> 00:05:16,060
The most important thing is to truly do things for the people.

75
00:05:16,060 --> 00:05:19,680
I went to see it. Their kitchen here is not bad.

76
00:05:19,680 --> 00:05:22,780
Madam Shen went to stew a medicinal meal for you as soon as she got back.

77
00:05:25,990 --> 00:05:27,800
- Help me hold this. 
 - Kid.

78
00:05:27,800 --> 00:05:29,420
Why is it you?

79
00:05:29,420 --> 00:05:31,208
Your masterâ€¦

80
00:05:32,960 --> 00:05:34,280
Where is your sister?

81
00:05:34,280 --> 00:05:38,320
As soon as my sister came back, I pestered her to teach me skills. She readily agreed.

82
00:05:38,320 --> 00:05:41,260
But then she led me to the kitchen and taught me how to cook a medicinal meal.

83
00:05:41,260 --> 00:05:44,040
Then she left in a hurry to meet with her close friend,

84
00:05:44,040 --> 00:05:45,740
leaving me to watch the pot for four hours.

85
00:05:45,740 --> 00:05:48,140
Close friend?

86
00:06:00,080 --> 00:06:02,920
 The young man from Yingzhou is tired of the wilds. 

87
00:06:02,920 --> 00:06:06,200
 Fur-clad, he hunts below the city. 

88
00:06:06,840 --> 00:06:10,120
 The code is correct. But why is it a male voice? 

89
00:06:10,120 --> 00:06:14,080
 No, this voice sounds very familiar. 

90
00:06:21,380 --> 00:06:25,080
How is it you?

91
00:06:27,680 --> 00:06:29,610
The young man from Yingzhou is tired of the wilds.

92
00:06:29,610 --> 00:06:32,140
Fur-clad, he hunts below the city.

93
00:06:32,140 --> 00:06:34,560
A thousand cups of barbarian wine do not intoxicate.

94
00:06:34,560 --> 00:06:37,500
Hu children can ride horses at the age of ten.

95
00:06:38,800 --> 00:06:42,800
I am Chi. Pleased to meet you, Sixth Miss!

96
00:06:50,440 --> 00:06:53,280
Chichi?

97
00:06:53,280 --> 00:06:56,320
Chichi.

98
00:06:57,720 --> 00:06:59,600
You are a gentleman.

99
00:06:59,600 --> 00:07:03,180
Why did you lie to me saying you were a young lady from Jiangnan?

100
00:07:05,480 --> 00:07:07,480
Actually, I did not intend to deceive you.

101
00:07:07,480 --> 00:07:11,100
It's just that when you replied for the first time you called me a young lady.

102
00:07:11,100 --> 00:07:12,780
Iâ€¦

103
00:07:14,040 --> 00:07:16,400
Who let you use a woman's floral letter paper

104
00:07:16,400 --> 00:07:20,220
which was fragrant and contained flower petals?

105
00:07:20,220 --> 00:07:23,180
Sir, you said you would write lyrics for my new tune.

106
00:07:23,180 --> 00:07:27,100
It has been over a month. When will you write them for me?

107
00:07:27,100 --> 00:07:29,680
I'll write them.

108
00:07:43,140 --> 00:07:46,180
   

109
00:07:46,180 --> 00:07:48,880
 Help me send this letter to the Ministry of Justice. 

110
00:07:48,880 --> 00:07:50,824
 Thank you very much. 

111
00:07:55,040 --> 00:07:56,976
 Director Wu, 

112
00:07:59,520 --> 00:08:03,600
 these are letters received after we advertised for clues to difficult cases. 

113
00:08:03,600 --> 00:08:06,280
 I have organized them according to region. This one on top isâ€¦ 

114
00:08:06,280 --> 00:08:08,620
 Throw them away. 

115
00:08:10,500 --> 00:08:15,300
 Do you not understand my words? Throw them away. 

116
00:08:15,300 --> 00:08:18,920
 If you really have nothing to do go and scrub the floor. 

117
00:08:36,780 --> 00:08:41,060
 My observations on the Ministry of Justice's doubtful cases. 

118
00:08:42,240 --> 00:08:46,220
I thought you were a young lady from a Jiangnan family

119
00:08:46,220 --> 00:08:48,470
who likes to investigate and analyze cases, just like me.

120
00:08:48,470 --> 00:08:51,040
That's why there was a first reply.

121
00:08:51,940 --> 00:08:55,300
Chichi is actually a name I came up with casually.

122
00:08:55,300 --> 00:08:57,080
The flower...

123
00:08:58,120 --> 00:09:00,200
was lent to me by someone else.

124
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:02,680
I called you by the wrong gender.

125
00:09:02,680 --> 00:09:05,600
Why didn't you correct me in your later replies?

126
00:09:05,600 --> 00:09:07,160
Actually, this is what I was thinking.

127
00:09:07,160 --> 00:09:10,100
Since we are pen pals, whether I am a young gentleman

128
00:09:10,100 --> 00:09:13,360
or a young lady doesn't affect our friendship through writing,

129
00:09:13,360 --> 00:09:17,060
talking about everything under the sun, and exchanging case details. Right?

130
00:09:18,340 --> 00:09:20,540
That's true.

131
00:09:20,540 --> 00:09:23,620
Now that you mention it, it does feel more carefree.

132
00:09:25,020 --> 00:09:28,280
By the way, I don't know what you like.

133
00:09:28,280 --> 00:09:31,960
So I specially looked for a copy of the rare book Records of the Western Regions' Unique Skills.

134
00:09:31,960 --> 00:09:36,040
This book records the Western Regions' exclusive tools and techniques.

135
00:09:36,040 --> 00:09:38,860
Take a look; see if you like it.

136
00:09:43,020 --> 00:09:45,700
Thank you, I like it very much.

137
00:09:49,100 --> 00:09:50,780
Wait a minute.

138
00:09:51,880 --> 00:09:54,140
It's this page.

139
00:09:54,140 --> 00:09:56,840
Take a close look at the scimitar on this page.

140
00:09:56,840 --> 00:10:00,100
After you left today, I took another look

141
00:10:00,100 --> 00:10:01,760
at the headless corpse's wound.

142
00:10:01,760 --> 00:10:04,160
From the angle of the wound and the smoothness of it,

143
00:10:04,160 --> 00:10:07,120
it must not have been caused by a straight blade but by a curved one.

144
00:10:07,120 --> 00:10:10,120
So according to my judgment, this murder weapon

145
00:10:10,120 --> 00:10:13,440
should be a specially made sharp scimitar.

146
00:10:13,440 --> 00:10:16,420
I've seen such scimitars at the border of Xichen.

147
00:10:16,420 --> 00:10:18,540
The scimitar depicted on this page

148
00:10:18,540 --> 00:10:21,360
has only minor differences at the blade edge compared to the one found at the victim's neck.

149
00:10:21,360 --> 00:10:22,960
The structure is nearly identical.

150
00:10:22,960 --> 00:10:27,120
So whether it is this particular one needs further investigation.

151
00:10:28,240 --> 00:10:30,920
The Western Regions scimitar?

152
00:10:31,600 --> 00:10:34,480
No wonder I pondered hard today

153
00:10:34,480 --> 00:10:37,140
and couldn't figure out what weapon was used.

154
00:10:37,140 --> 00:10:39,880
Turns out it was a weapon I had never seen before.

155
00:10:39,880 --> 00:10:42,520
I really should read this book carefully and get to know more about Western Region weapons.

156
00:10:42,520 --> 00:10:44,360
I really should read this book carefully and get to know more about Western Region weapons.

157
00:10:44,360 --> 00:10:47,360
Perhaps I can find clues within it.

158
00:10:49,740 --> 00:10:51,520
This time I came to Gannandao.

159
00:10:51,520 --> 00:10:55,480
Besides investigating the case, there's something even more important.

160
00:11:16,400 --> 00:11:18,600
Great Chief, Governor Mo is weary today.

161
00:11:18,600 --> 00:11:20,400
He has retired early and is not available for a meeting.

162
00:11:20,400 --> 00:11:23,300
You should return early to rest.

163
00:11:23,300 --> 00:11:25,700
Please convey my message to Governor Mo.

164
00:11:25,700 --> 00:11:27,400
I shall visit another day for a lengthy conversation.

165
00:11:27,400 --> 00:11:29,600
Understood.

166
00:11:29,600 --> 00:11:31,500
Great Chief, please.

167
00:11:43,400 --> 00:11:47,000
Like a dream, like a fairy, suddenly all is scattered.

168
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:51,300
Where has the sunset glow gone, leaving the green screen void.

169
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:02,900
Thus, long before the incident at Xiang'an City,

170
00:12:02,900 --> 00:12:04,600
in the hands of the human traffickers at Gannandao,

171
00:12:04,600 --> 00:12:05,900
there was already the Moth Jade.

172
00:12:05,900 --> 00:12:07,000
That's right.

173
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:09,500
The Huo'e Sect in Gannandao has penetrated far and deep,

174
00:12:09,500 --> 00:12:11,400
far beyond our imagination.

175
00:12:11,400 --> 00:12:12,800
I've been investigating covertly all along the way and found quite a number of the local populace secretly adhering to the Huo'e Sect.

176
00:12:12,800 --> 00:12:14,500
I've been investigating covertly all along the way and found quite a number of the local populace secretly adhering to the Huo'e Sect.

177
00:12:14,500 --> 00:12:16,800
I've been investigating covertly all along the way and found quite a number of the local populace secretly adhering to the Huo'e Sect.

178
00:12:17,600 --> 00:12:19,800
From Xiang'an to Yingzhou.

179
00:12:19,800 --> 00:12:22,600
I have always felt that behind the Huo'e Sect,

180
00:12:22,600 --> 00:12:25,700
there is an invisible pair of hands weaving a grand scheme.

181
00:12:25,700 --> 00:12:30,100
The person behind this scheme must be someone with overwhelming power.

182
00:13:30,500 --> 00:13:32,800
Before we knew it, we had talked for so long.

183
00:13:32,800 --> 00:13:35,200
It's late at night, I should head back.

184
00:13:36,680 --> 00:13:39,600
Let's talk more next time.

185
00:13:39,600 --> 00:13:41,400
Where's my gift?

186
00:13:41,400 --> 00:13:43,300
You didn't forget to prepare one, did you?

187
00:13:44,800 --> 00:13:47,600
I did prepare one.

188
00:13:47,600 --> 00:13:51,600
But it might not suit you. You surely wouldn't like it.

189
00:13:51,600 --> 00:13:54,000
Next time, I'll buy you a newer one.

190
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:55,600
You didn't even let me take a look.

191
00:13:55,600 --> 00:13:58,100
How would you know if I like it or not?

192
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:05,440
It's you who insist on seeing it.

193
00:14:17,600 --> 00:14:19,500
All right, you've seen it.

194
00:14:19,500 --> 00:14:21,600
Give up on it.

195
00:14:23,800 --> 00:14:26,300
Who ever heard of taking back a gift that was given?

196
00:14:26,300 --> 00:14:28,200
Besides, I like it very much.

197
00:14:28,200 --> 00:14:31,900
I just happen to need a hairpin.

198
00:14:33,500 --> 00:14:35,100
Well then...

199
00:14:38,800 --> 00:14:41,000
Please put it on for me with your own hands.

200
00:14:55,200 --> 00:14:59,200
How does it look? Is it pretty?

201
00:15:01,200 --> 00:15:03,800
 Why did the candle suddenly go out? 

202
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:07,700
 Could it beâ€¦? 

203
00:15:08,400 --> 00:15:10,000
Pretty good-looking indeed.

204
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:12,700
It's getting late. I really should go.

205
00:15:14,600 --> 00:15:16,500
I'll take my leave then.

206
00:15:50,400 --> 00:15:51,800
It's so late.

207
00:15:51,800 --> 00:15:54,300
Are you planning to stay up for me?

208
00:16:05,800 --> 00:16:07,400
What are you dawdling for?

209
00:16:07,400 --> 00:16:09,520
Come over and rest now.

210
00:16:16,200 --> 00:16:17,600
 Forget it. 

211
00:16:17,600 --> 00:16:20,200
 We've slept in the same bed before. 

212
00:16:20,200 --> 00:16:24,100
 If I catch a cold, that's truly asking for trouble.  

213
00:16:32,800 --> 00:16:36,500
Does that Pan Chi really suit your taste?

214
00:16:36,500 --> 00:16:39,100
What do you mean suit my taste?

215
00:16:40,600 --> 00:16:42,600
Are you talking about solving cases?

216
00:16:42,600 --> 00:16:44,600
I do have a good rapport with him.

217
00:16:44,600 --> 00:16:46,300
Youâ€¦

218
00:16:48,600 --> 00:16:49,900
What are you doing?

219
00:16:49,900 --> 00:16:52,000
If you keep this up, I won't be polite anymore.

220
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:54,040
Not polite?

221
00:16:54,800 --> 00:16:58,900
I'd like to see how you'll be impolite.

222
00:17:11,400 --> 00:17:16,200
Shen Du, you're not sleeping in the middle of the night.

223
00:17:16,200 --> 00:17:18,300
What madness is this?

224
00:17:31,400 --> 00:17:34,000
Someone is beating the drum to appeal for justice.

225
00:17:36,100 --> 00:17:37,400
Who is beating the drum below the hall?

226
00:17:37,400 --> 00:17:39,200
What is the grievance?

227
00:17:39,200 --> 00:17:42,900
My Lord, I am named Du Fusheng.

228
00:17:42,900 --> 00:17:44,800
I am a medicinal herb trader.

229
00:17:44,800 --> 00:17:47,900
Today is the day my daughter Du Xiaowan

230
00:17:47,900 --> 00:17:51,400
is to wed the son of Li Hongfa, Li Zimo.

231
00:17:51,400 --> 00:17:54,100
But unexpectedly, a strange event occurred.

232
00:17:54,100 --> 00:17:56,600
My daughter was still there when she was being welcomed in.

233
00:17:56,600 --> 00:18:00,200
But when the wedding banquet ended and it was time for the bridal chamber rites,

234
00:18:00,200 --> 00:18:02,100
we discovered that my daughter had disappeared.

235
00:18:02,100 --> 00:18:03,600
The incident happened suddenly

236
00:18:03,600 --> 00:18:05,100
and she was nowhere to be found despite a search.

237
00:18:05,100 --> 00:18:07,800
That's why we came to report to the officials.

238
00:18:08,680 --> 00:18:10,680
On the wedding day, there were many guests.

239
00:18:10,700 --> 00:18:13,800
This won't be easy to investigate. Do you have a guest list?

240
00:18:13,800 --> 00:18:16,900
Yes. Here it is.

241
00:18:16,900 --> 00:18:18,900
Present it.

242
00:18:23,400 --> 00:18:26,400
Is the marriage between your two families out of mutual affection?

243
00:18:26,400 --> 00:18:28,100
Of course.

244
00:18:28,100 --> 00:18:32,000
Xiaowan and I are well-matched in social status and have mutual affection.

245
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:34,600
But who would have known such a thing would happen?

246
00:18:34,600 --> 00:18:38,600
I implore you, Governor Mo, you must find Xiaowan.

247
00:18:41,100 --> 00:18:42,200
Guards!

248
00:18:42,200 --> 00:18:44,800
Take men to inspect both households, especially the Li family.

249
00:18:44,800 --> 00:18:46,200
Conduct a careful investigation.

250
00:18:46,200 --> 00:18:48,400
See if there are any traces left behind.

251
00:18:48,400 --> 00:18:51,100
Take a closer look at the entries and exits of the gates everywhere.

252
00:18:51,100 --> 00:18:52,600
Yes.

253
00:18:57,500 --> 00:19:00,000
Governor Mo, the guest list has been verified.

254
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:01,300
Most of the people are still there.

255
00:19:01,300 --> 00:19:03,300
Only a few are not present.

256
00:19:03,300 --> 00:19:06,200
Find them. Bring them all back after finding them.

257
00:19:06,200 --> 00:19:07,600
Yes.

258
00:19:09,600 --> 00:19:11,400
- What's the matter? 
 - My Lord,

259
00:19:11,400 --> 00:19:13,000
if we all go out to look for people,

260
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:16,100
I'm afraid there won't be enough people here to investigate the case.

261
00:19:17,100 --> 00:19:18,800
Governor Mo,

262
00:19:18,800 --> 00:19:22,100
if there are not enough hands, my guards can help.

263
00:19:25,920 --> 00:19:28,760
Then I will trouble you, Great Chief Shen.

264
00:19:36,600 --> 00:19:38,600
Jing Lin.

265
00:19:38,600 --> 00:19:40,200
Yes.

266
00:19:42,200 --> 00:19:43,500
Go on.

267
00:19:43,500 --> 00:19:45,100
Yes.

268
00:19:45,100 --> 00:19:46,400
You guys, follow me.

269
00:19:46,400 --> 00:19:48,300
You guys, follow me as well.

270
00:20:24,700 --> 00:20:27,000
 Li Hongfa's family is wealthy. 

271
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:30,400
 The bridal chamber must have been meticulously arranged. 

272
00:20:30,400 --> 00:20:33,400
 There are no signs of a struggle inside the room. 

273
00:20:36,220 --> 00:20:38,600
   

274
00:20:38,600 --> 00:20:41,400
It seems something had happened in the bridal chamber.

275
00:20:41,400 --> 00:20:45,100
In a fit of anger, someone clawed at this place.

276
00:20:47,100 --> 00:20:48,900
It was meant to be a wedding,

277
00:20:48,900 --> 00:20:52,000
yet there's something odd everywhere here.

278
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:55,400
Moreover, this door frame has clearly been refurbished,

279
00:20:55,400 --> 00:20:58,000
but there are traces of peeling paint.

280
00:20:58,000 --> 00:20:59,700
There must be a problem with this.

281
00:20:59,700 --> 00:21:01,700
I think so too.

282
00:21:01,700 --> 00:21:04,000
By the way, have you found anything over there?

283
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:05,600
I passed through the living room

284
00:21:05,600 --> 00:21:08,800
and also passed by the corner pavilion and rockery.

285
00:21:08,800 --> 00:21:13,200
But along this way, nothing was found.

286
00:21:13,200 --> 00:21:15,200
That's right.

287
00:21:17,600 --> 00:21:19,400
The bride did not leave of her own accord

288
00:21:19,400 --> 00:21:21,000
but was kidnapped by someone familiar

289
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:23,400
and taken away through the back window.

290
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:36,800
Given the urgency of the case at hand,

291
00:21:36,800 --> 00:21:39,600
you two still have the mood to chat here.

292
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:46,400
Chief Clerk Yan and I were analyzing the case.

293
00:21:46,400 --> 00:21:48,000
What counts as idle chat?

294
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:52,200
Moreover, we have already reached a conclusion.

295
00:21:52,200 --> 00:21:56,600
The bride was kidnapped through this back window.

296
00:21:56,600 --> 00:21:59,600
All right. Now it's time for certain people to get busy.

297
00:21:59,600 --> 00:22:02,700
Hurry and order a search for the bride.

298
00:22:07,840 --> 00:22:09,400
Very well.

299
00:22:09,400 --> 00:22:11,500
Master Pan, please lead the way.

300
00:22:11,500 --> 00:22:15,400
Together with my imperial guards, apprehend the suspect.

301
00:22:20,800 --> 00:22:22,700
Why did you leave halfway through?

302
00:22:22,700 --> 00:22:25,400
A servant from my home came to report that the child was sick.

303
00:22:25,400 --> 00:22:28,900
My spouse didn't know how to take care of the child.

304
00:22:30,080 --> 00:22:32,220
By that time, it was already so late.

305
00:22:32,220 --> 00:22:34,760
Could it last until dawn?

306
00:22:34,760 --> 00:22:39,700
My Lord, about this matter, please don't tell my wife.

307
00:22:39,700 --> 00:22:43,160
I came to check on my concubine.

308
00:22:43,160 --> 00:22:47,560
At the wedding, did anything strange happen?

309
00:22:47,560 --> 00:22:49,290
No.

310
00:22:50,040 --> 00:22:54,700
Except for that Xu Jize performed exceptionally well,

311
00:22:54,700 --> 00:22:58,440
I didn't notice anything else different.

312
00:22:58,440 --> 00:23:01,300
As for Xu Jize, it was really hard on him.

313
00:23:01,300 --> 00:23:03,840
The profession of a wedding conductor is not an easy one to begin with.

314
00:23:03,840 --> 00:23:06,100
Few people are in this line of work in Yingzhou.

315
00:23:06,100 --> 00:23:07,580
But I heard

316
00:23:07,580 --> 00:23:11,200
that he had no one to recommend him and no access to recruitment examinations.

317
00:23:11,200 --> 00:23:13,960
That's why he became a wedding conductor.

318
00:23:17,240 --> 00:23:19,240
Please, everyone.

319
00:23:20,300 --> 00:23:21,580
Where is Xu Yize?

320
00:23:21,580 --> 00:23:23,410
Why isn't he here?

321
00:23:24,140 --> 00:23:25,760
My Lord, we did not find him.

322
00:23:25,760 --> 00:23:28,000
Not found?

323
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:32,600
 It seems that way, Xu Jize was the only one who left early 

324
00:23:32,600 --> 00:23:35,780
 and someone who could be in close contact with the bride. 

325
00:23:35,780 --> 00:23:40,440
Chief Clerk Yan, do you think the murderer is Xu Jize?

326
00:23:40,440 --> 00:23:43,600
I cannot answer that question at the moment.

327
00:23:43,600 --> 00:23:48,440
Before the case is solved, every person present is under suspicion.

328
00:23:48,880 --> 00:23:50,640
His absence from the scene now

329
00:23:50,640 --> 00:23:54,330
only indicates that his suspicion is deepened.

330
00:23:55,000 --> 00:23:58,320
Ultimately, physical and testimonial evidence are required.

331
00:24:02,360 --> 00:24:05,160
Indeed, you are the wife of Great Chief Shen.

332
00:24:05,160 --> 00:24:08,280
Although young, you speak and act without fault.

333
00:24:08,280 --> 00:24:10,760
You have your own set of rules.

334
00:24:10,760 --> 00:24:15,700
Your words show a deep understanding of the Great Chief.

335
00:24:17,440 --> 00:24:19,620
Take them all back to the Governor's mansion.

336
00:24:19,620 --> 00:24:21,260
 Yes! 

337
00:24:21,260 --> 00:24:22,908
Let's go.

338
00:24:34,621 --> 00:24:36,240
   

339
00:24:53,240 --> 00:24:55,060
Please don't kill me.

340
00:24:55,060 --> 00:24:56,680
Don't kill me.

341
00:24:56,680 --> 00:24:58,040
Who are you?

342
00:24:58,040 --> 00:25:00,520
Why are you panicking and running away in the middle of the night?

343
00:25:00,520 --> 00:25:02,320
My name is Xu Jize.

344
00:25:02,320 --> 00:25:04,740
Don't kill me, please.

345
00:25:04,740 --> 00:25:06,410
Over there.

346
00:25:07,600 --> 00:25:10,900
Someone has died over there.

347
00:25:11,500 --> 00:25:13,780
Xu Jize?

348
00:25:14,280 --> 00:25:16,480
You're the wedding conductor?

349
00:25:17,840 --> 00:25:20,060
Hand the person over to Governor Mo.

350
00:25:24,760 --> 00:25:26,760
Well done, Shen Du.

351
00:25:26,760 --> 00:25:28,800
Throwing a commoner out to block the road.

352
00:25:28,800 --> 00:25:30,600
Is this the style of the Imperial Guards?

353
00:25:30,600 --> 00:25:34,800
The style of the Imperial Guards is that of a killing machine

354
00:25:34,800 --> 00:25:38,160
or perhaps a plague god who silences crying babies at night.

355
00:25:39,760 --> 00:25:43,280
Which do you want, Master Pan?

356
00:25:49,640 --> 00:25:52,240
You are wise to be self-aware.

357
00:25:52,240 --> 00:25:55,380
I truly admire this.

358
00:25:55,380 --> 00:25:57,660
But since we've come this far in our discussion,

359
00:25:57,660 --> 00:25:59,300
let's just lay it all out.

360
00:25:59,300 --> 00:26:01,900
You've been targeting me everywhere, finding fault with me at every turn.

361
00:26:01,900 --> 00:26:04,840
If that's the case, why do you insist on dragging me along to chase the killer?

362
00:26:04,840 --> 00:26:07,660
You're also self-aware.

363
00:26:07,660 --> 00:26:09,480
Knowing that you're a thorn in my side, why do you keep showing up?

364
00:26:09,480 --> 00:26:11,920
Knowing that you're a thorn in my side, why do you keep showing up?

365
00:26:11,920 --> 00:26:15,360
That's a requirement for solving the case. I had no other choice.

366
00:26:15,360 --> 00:26:17,880
A requirement for solving the case?

367
00:26:17,880 --> 00:26:21,360
Pushing your luck when seeing I'm present.

368
00:26:21,360 --> 00:26:23,820
Is it also out of necessity?

369
00:26:36,160 --> 00:26:38,480
 Save me, please. 

370
00:26:40,400 --> 00:26:42,660
Why has it gone quiet?

371
00:27:14,720 --> 00:27:18,800
You, go down and have a look.

372
00:27:18,800 --> 00:27:20,900
Why should I go down?

373
00:27:20,900 --> 00:27:22,780
You, the Great Chief, are here.

374
00:27:22,780 --> 00:27:24,260
Who knows what's happening below?

375
00:27:24,260 --> 00:27:27,480
Besides, if I were to go down, what if someone else kills me?

376
00:27:28,120 --> 00:27:30,120
If you were to die,

377
00:27:30,120 --> 00:27:33,340
I would collect your corpse and build a grave for you.

378
00:27:33,340 --> 00:27:36,460
I won't let your soul wander about so as not to scare others.

379
00:27:36,460 --> 00:27:39,460
- Why is your tongue so venomous? 
 - Can't outtalk me, huh?

380
00:27:39,460 --> 00:27:41,520
Go down.

381
00:27:43,120 --> 00:27:46,720
I'll go take a look at the situation first.

382
00:27:57,660 --> 00:27:59,780
You areâ€¦

383
00:27:59,780 --> 00:28:02,420
Don't be afraid. I'll rescue you and bring you up.

384
00:28:09,460 --> 00:28:11,220
Great Chief.

385
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:33,850
You're the bride from today?

386
00:28:33,850 --> 00:28:35,900
   

387
00:28:36,960 --> 00:28:38,440
Yes.

388
00:28:38,440 --> 00:28:40,120
I am Du Xiaowan.

389
00:28:40,120 --> 00:28:42,640
My Lord, save me.

390
00:28:44,400 --> 00:28:45,960
There's another person below.

391
00:28:45,960 --> 00:28:48,048
Another one.

392
00:28:53,680 --> 00:28:55,520
You still have some conscience.

393
00:28:55,520 --> 00:28:58,180
I climbed up by myself.

394
00:28:58,180 --> 00:28:59,864
My waist.

395
00:29:02,160 --> 00:29:03,700
To think you're the Great Chief.

396
00:29:03,700 --> 00:29:05,280
Do you really understand the rules of the martial land?

397
00:29:05,280 --> 00:29:07,240
Framing me time and time again.

398
00:29:07,240 --> 00:29:09,240
It's not you.

399
00:29:10,200 --> 00:29:12,080
Another one.

400
00:29:12,080 --> 00:29:14,400
A dead person.

401
00:29:33,900 --> 00:29:36,900
You guys go and scout around.

402
00:29:36,900 --> 00:29:38,800
Jing Lin, go check below.

403
00:29:38,800 --> 00:29:41,220
- See if there are any abnormalities. 
 - Yes.

404
00:30:14,760 --> 00:30:17,220
Great Chief, there are no abnormalities below.

405
00:30:17,220 --> 00:30:18,920
Great Chief, the surroundings have all been checked.

406
00:30:18,920 --> 00:30:20,280
There are no abnormalities.

407
00:30:20,280 --> 00:30:21,320
Along the way,

408
00:30:21,320 --> 00:30:24,580
we all saw that suspicious wedding conductor with a tense expression.

409
00:30:24,580 --> 00:30:26,280
Why do you need to inspect repeatedly?

410
00:30:26,280 --> 00:30:29,740
Are you so certain that person is not the murderer?

411
00:30:29,740 --> 00:30:32,080
I cannot be sure whether that person is the murderer or not.

412
00:30:32,080 --> 00:30:34,280
But my intuition tells me

413
00:30:34,280 --> 00:30:39,180
this matter is not as simple as we have seen.

414
00:30:40,360 --> 00:30:42,680
I have truly broadened my horizons.

415
00:30:42,680 --> 00:30:44,800
The prestigious Great Chief solves cases

416
00:30:44,800 --> 00:30:48,000
by relying on an extraordinary intuitive talent.

417
00:30:49,300 --> 00:30:52,160
Great Chief, will you continue the investigation?

418
00:30:54,220 --> 00:30:55,804
Let's withdraw.

419
00:31:07,400 --> 00:31:08,940
Where is she, you beast?

420
00:31:08,940 --> 00:31:11,660
Return my daughter! Where have you hidden her?

421
00:31:11,660 --> 00:31:15,820
- Where is Xiaowan? Speak up! 
 - Beast!

422
00:31:15,820 --> 00:31:18,640
You may not act recklessly in the court hall.

423
00:31:18,640 --> 00:31:21,400
Xu Jize, let me ask you.

424
00:31:21,400 --> 00:31:24,420
Regarding the case of Miss Du's disappearance, is it related to you?

425
00:31:24,420 --> 00:31:26,120
It's a false accusation, My Lord.

426
00:31:26,120 --> 00:31:28,840
The matter of Miss Du being abducted has nothing to do with me.

427
00:31:28,840 --> 00:31:30,400
I just wanted to go and rescue her.

428
00:31:30,400 --> 00:31:33,300
Do you have any witnesses or physical evidence to prove it?

429
00:31:33,300 --> 00:31:35,980
My Lord, the incident happened suddenly,

430
00:31:35,980 --> 00:31:37,560
and I was in a hurry to rescue her.

431
00:31:37,560 --> 00:31:39,320
No one saw all this.

432
00:31:39,320 --> 00:31:40,840
But every word I say is true.

433
00:31:40,840 --> 00:31:42,700
I ask for your clear judgment, My Lord.

434
00:31:42,700 --> 00:31:45,440
So there are no witnesses or physical evidence.

435
00:31:48,540 --> 00:31:51,360
Madam, the Great Chief has returned.

436
00:32:05,040 --> 00:32:06,520
You've finally returned.

437
00:32:06,520 --> 00:32:08,560
Have you made any discoveries?

438
00:32:09,520 --> 00:32:11,500
The bride has been found

439
00:32:11,500 --> 00:32:13,880
and a body has been brought back.

440
00:32:15,420 --> 00:32:18,080
A dead person?

441
00:32:18,080 --> 00:32:21,360
How about you? Are you injured?

442
00:32:21,360 --> 00:32:23,600
Am I someone who can be easily injured?

443
00:32:23,600 --> 00:32:26,560
Am I someone who can be easily injured?

444
00:32:26,560 --> 00:32:28,460
My wife, there's no need for concern.

445
00:32:28,460 --> 00:32:29,960
What's happened to you?

446
00:32:29,960 --> 00:32:33,700
Why are your hands all injured? And there's mud on your body.

447
00:32:36,120 --> 00:32:39,120
That's a question for your smart husband.

448
00:32:39,120 --> 00:32:42,260
I've done all the dirty, tiring work myself on the way.

449
00:32:42,260 --> 00:32:45,280
In the end, he reaps all the credit.

450
00:32:47,040 --> 00:32:50,840
Regardless of anything, it's a good thing that you've returned safely.

451
00:32:50,840 --> 00:32:53,940
By the way, how did you bring the bride back?

452
00:32:53,940 --> 00:32:55,980
Quick, tell me the details.

453
00:32:55,980 --> 00:32:59,480
First, on the way, we encountered the panicking suspect fleeing.

454
00:32:59,480 --> 00:33:02,280
Then we found the bride trapped in the cellar well.

455
00:33:02,280 --> 00:33:06,280
Besides the bride, there was also a corpse in the cellar well.

456
00:33:06,280 --> 00:33:08,040
So we brought them both back together.

457
00:33:08,040 --> 00:33:10,680
The suspect you mentioned

458
00:33:10,680 --> 00:33:14,360
is the Xu Jize the imperial guards brought back?

459
00:33:14,360 --> 00:33:17,240
Exactly, the wedding conductor.

460
00:33:17,240 --> 00:33:18,800
After you left,

461
00:33:18,800 --> 00:33:21,600
I questioned the guests who attended the banquet and conducted an investigation.

462
00:33:21,600 --> 00:33:24,960
This Xu Jize they spoke of is considered a very good person.

463
00:33:24,960 --> 00:33:29,120
On the surface, he has no motive to commit the crime.

464
00:33:29,120 --> 00:33:31,720
Whether he is the murderer or not remains to be further investigated.

465
00:33:31,720 --> 00:33:35,080
By the way, when we were at the bottom of the well,

466
00:33:35,080 --> 00:33:36,800
I remember there was a sack.

467
00:33:36,800 --> 00:33:40,580
That sack was probably used to kidnap the bride.

468
00:33:40,580 --> 00:33:42,480
Such an important piece of evidence.

469
00:33:42,480 --> 00:33:44,360
Why didn't you mention it earlier?

470
00:33:44,360 --> 00:33:46,580
I'm not your subordinate.

471
00:33:46,580 --> 00:33:49,560
Why should I report everything to you?

472
00:33:52,080 --> 00:33:55,060
All right. You two go and change your clothes now.

473
00:33:55,060 --> 00:33:56,520
I'll be waiting for you in the hall.

474
00:33:56,520 --> 00:33:58,720
This is a matter for the Yingzhou government office.

475
00:33:58,720 --> 00:34:01,640
It should be decided by Governor Mo himself.

476
00:34:01,640 --> 00:34:03,960
I shall not go to the hall.

477
00:34:25,239 --> 00:34:27,560
 You captured me without any evidence. 

478
00:34:27,560 --> 00:34:28,920
 I've been wronged. 

479
00:34:28,920 --> 00:34:31,980
 - I risked my life  to save Miss Du.  
 - What stage of the trial are we at?

480
00:34:31,980 --> 00:34:34,900
I missed a few things earlier, and now I have no clue. 
  - Since Miss Du has already been found... 

481
00:34:34,900 --> 00:34:37,239
And she wasn't hurt, just a sprained ankle.

482
00:34:37,239 --> 00:34:41,660
My Lord, isn't it time to treat me with a different attitude?

483
00:34:41,660 --> 00:34:44,360
This person really knows how to sing their own praises.

484
00:34:44,360 --> 00:34:45,800
Before the evidence is presented,

485
00:34:45,800 --> 00:34:47,920
he made himself seem absolutely innocent.

486
00:34:47,920 --> 00:34:50,000
He even seeks courteous treatment in court.

487
00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:53,460
It's really my first time seeing such an arrogant person.

488
00:34:53,460 --> 00:34:56,560
A tree without bark will surely die.

489
00:34:56,560 --> 00:34:59,560
A person without shame is invincible in the world.

490
00:34:59,560 --> 00:35:02,240
You won't cry until you see the coffin.

491
00:35:02,240 --> 00:35:05,620
Governor Mo, I have new evidence to present.

492
00:35:06,840 --> 00:35:08,160
Xu Jize,

493
00:35:08,160 --> 00:35:12,760
does this object look familiar to you?

494
00:35:12,760 --> 00:35:14,280
This item has nothing to do with me.

495
00:35:14,280 --> 00:35:15,760
It must belong to the murderer.

496
00:35:15,760 --> 00:35:17,900
It was all the deceased's fault, harming Miss Du.

497
00:35:17,900 --> 00:35:20,680
I came to rescue her. Don't wrongly accuse the innocent.

498
00:35:20,680 --> 00:35:24,680
Then tell us in detail what you saw.

499
00:35:24,680 --> 00:35:28,860
I-I was just using the toilet at that time.

500
00:35:28,860 --> 00:35:33,000
When I came out, I saw the criminal kidnapping Miss Du.

501
00:35:33,000 --> 00:35:34,520
It happened so suddenly at the time.

502
00:35:34,520 --> 00:35:36,520
I didn't have time to notify others

503
00:35:36,520 --> 00:35:38,760
and I was worried about Miss Du's safety.

504
00:35:38,760 --> 00:35:40,640
So I went to rescue her alone.

505
00:35:40,640 --> 00:35:42,760
You have no evidence.

506
00:35:42,760 --> 00:35:44,220
How can people believe you?

507
00:35:44,220 --> 00:35:46,920
Heaven and earth know, every word I say is true.

508
00:35:46,920 --> 00:35:49,520
Please discern carefully.

509
00:35:49,520 --> 00:35:51,640
Let me say it for you.

510
00:35:51,640 --> 00:35:54,000
You and the deceased were accomplices.

511
00:35:54,000 --> 00:35:55,960
You kidnapped Miss Du together.

512
00:35:55,960 --> 00:35:59,640
Then, due to disagreements, you killed your fellow accomplice.

513
00:35:59,640 --> 00:36:03,520
In order to cover up the facts, you pretend to be a good person

514
00:36:03,520 --> 00:36:06,340
and distanced yourself from all responsibilities, making yourself seem completely uninvolved.

515
00:36:06,340 --> 00:36:09,520
My Lord, I've been wronged. I really did not kill anyone.

516
00:36:09,520 --> 00:36:11,560
I didn't know the deceased at all.

517
00:36:11,560 --> 00:36:14,120
Why would I kill him?

518
00:36:17,400 --> 00:36:20,640
 When a person is lying, they blink continuously 

519
00:36:20,640 --> 00:36:23,080
 and often wrinkle their nose. 

520
00:36:23,080 --> 00:36:25,560
 Yet when he just claimed that he did not kill anyone, 

521
00:36:25,560 --> 00:36:27,880
 his expression was exceptionally firm, 

522
00:36:27,880 --> 00:36:29,880
 indicating that he wasn't lying. 

523
00:36:29,880 --> 00:36:31,960
Now that you didn't know the deceased,

524
00:36:31,960 --> 00:36:34,520
how did you witness him being killed?

525
00:36:34,520 --> 00:36:36,980
I didn't witness him being killed with my own eyes.

526
00:36:36,980 --> 00:36:39,380
When I got there, the person was already dead.

527
00:36:39,380 --> 00:36:42,560
According to what you said, you saw someone abducting Miss Du.

528
00:36:42,560 --> 00:36:45,600
Did that person have any distinctive features?

529
00:36:47,080 --> 00:36:50,480
The lighting wasn't very bright at that time.

530
00:36:50,480 --> 00:36:52,160
I didn't see clearly.

531
00:36:52,160 --> 00:36:55,700
Well, judging by the deceased's height and demeanor,

532
00:36:55,700 --> 00:36:57,920
he should be the one who abducted Miss Du.

533
00:36:57,920 --> 00:37:01,080
Merely judging from the height and demeanor.

534
00:37:01,080 --> 00:37:03,600
Haven't you noticed any other distinctive features?

535
00:37:03,600 --> 00:37:05,560
The incident happened suddenly.

536
00:37:05,560 --> 00:37:08,640
I didn't pay much attention to anything else.

537
00:37:08,640 --> 00:37:10,660
My Lord, Du Xiaowan is here.

538
00:37:10,660 --> 00:37:13,600
Wan'er! My Wan'er!

539
00:37:13,600 --> 00:37:15,760
It's okay now, my child.

540
00:37:15,760 --> 00:37:17,560
All right.

541
00:37:17,560 --> 00:37:20,520
Du Xiaowan, you are the party concerned.

542
00:37:20,520 --> 00:37:23,840
Narrate the events that happened today one by one.

543
00:37:23,840 --> 00:37:27,580
Xiaowan, we have paid our respects to heaven and earth.

544
00:37:27,580 --> 00:37:30,360
You are now my wife.

545
00:37:32,440 --> 00:37:35,080
I, Li Zimo, hereby swear to heaven,

546
00:37:35,080 --> 00:37:38,700
I will absolutely not hold any grudges because of today's events.

547
00:37:50,800 --> 00:37:54,760
Miss Du, I know that women value their reputation,

548
00:37:54,760 --> 00:37:56,640
making it difficult for you to speak up.

549
00:37:56,640 --> 00:37:58,720
But have you considered it?

550
00:37:58,720 --> 00:38:01,040
If the murderer is not brought to justice,

551
00:38:01,040 --> 00:38:04,560
there will be more young women who cannot escape his evil clutches?

552
00:38:04,560 --> 00:38:07,880
They may not have the chance of being rescued like you.

553
00:38:07,880 --> 00:38:11,740
Wife, let's jointly assist the governor to catch the culprit.

554
00:38:11,740 --> 00:38:13,550
All right?

555
00:38:20,600 --> 00:38:23,080
After performing the heaven and earth ritual,

556
00:38:23,080 --> 00:38:25,480
I met the wedding conductor in the bridal chamber.

557
00:38:25,480 --> 00:38:29,060
But then I suddenly fainted for some reason.

558
00:38:29,060 --> 00:38:32,400
When I came to, I was already in a sack.

559
00:38:32,400 --> 00:38:34,880
I didn't see who kidnapped me.

560
00:38:34,880 --> 00:38:36,440
I was extremely scared at that time

561
00:38:36,440 --> 00:38:38,640
and I couldn't shout for help.

562
00:38:38,640 --> 00:38:41,040
I only knew I was trapped in a sack

563
00:38:41,040 --> 00:38:43,040
and was carried on the shoulder of someone running.

564
00:38:43,040 --> 00:38:46,540
After a very long time, I was finally put down.

565
00:38:46,540 --> 00:38:48,000
Later, another person came.

566
00:38:48,000 --> 00:38:51,000
Did you hear what they were saying?

567
00:38:52,000 --> 00:38:55,200
I originally thought that person was there to rescue me.

568
00:38:55,200 --> 00:38:58,660
But to my surprise, the two of them turned out to be accomplices.

569
00:38:58,660 --> 00:39:01,960
They were discussing how to share me.

570
00:39:01,960 --> 00:39:03,980
Their language was unbearable to hear.

571
00:39:03,980 --> 00:39:07,200
I really cannot repeat it.

572
00:39:07,200 --> 00:39:10,780
Honorable officials, my wife has suffered such an insult.

573
00:39:10,780 --> 00:39:13,360
I plead with you to severely punish the culprit.

574
00:39:13,360 --> 00:39:14,800
Rest assured, Young Master Li.

575
00:39:14,800 --> 00:39:18,140
We will definitely not let the culprit escape the law.

576
00:39:18,640 --> 00:39:20,600
Later, I don't know what happened.

577
00:39:20,600 --> 00:39:23,320
The two of them started arguing.

578
00:39:23,320 --> 00:39:25,360
I made a mistake. Let her go.

579
00:39:25,360 --> 00:39:26,520
What are you joking about?

580
00:39:26,520 --> 00:39:28,720
What's done is done. You have to do it even if you don't want to.

581
00:39:28,720 --> 00:39:30,080
I'll go over there to check.

582
00:39:30,080 --> 00:39:33,520
After a while, it sounded like someone was chasing from behind.

583
00:39:33,520 --> 00:39:36,340
They then abandoned me in a cellar well in the ruins.

584
00:39:36,340 --> 00:39:38,520
Before even covering the cellar well properly,

585
00:39:38,520 --> 00:39:42,380
I heard a scream followed by a bang

586
00:39:42,380 --> 00:39:44,960
as if someone had fallen beside me.

587
00:39:44,960 --> 00:39:48,220
The sack loosened. I climbed out.

588
00:39:50,880 --> 00:39:52,600
Help!

589
00:39:52,600 --> 00:39:54,520
I heard someone coming,

590
00:39:54,520 --> 00:39:57,680
but I feared it was the accomplice who had escaped earlier.

591
00:39:57,680 --> 00:39:59,760
So I stopped shouting.

592
00:39:59,760 --> 00:40:03,700
Until someone jumped down from the well opening and rescued me.

593
00:40:05,560 --> 00:40:07,520
Since you've heard the two people talking,

594
00:40:07,520 --> 00:40:12,220
could you determine by their voices whether that person was Xu Jize?

595
00:40:15,080 --> 00:40:17,600
The situation was critical. I was extremely scared.

596
00:40:17,600 --> 00:40:20,000
I was so scared my head was buzzing.

597
00:40:20,000 --> 00:40:22,760
I couldn't make out whose voice it was.

598
00:40:24,680 --> 00:40:26,760
Miss Du has made it very clear.

599
00:40:26,760 --> 00:40:29,000
In the last moment before she fainted,

600
00:40:29,000 --> 00:40:30,920
the one she saw was Xu Jize.

601
00:40:30,920 --> 00:40:33,000
Regardless of whether you are the murderer or not,

602
00:40:33,000 --> 00:40:35,720
you certainly cannot absolve yourself of involvement in this case.

603
00:40:35,720 --> 00:40:37,360
Iâ€¦

604
00:40:37,360 --> 00:40:39,240
Xu Jize, you scoundrel!

605
00:40:39,240 --> 00:40:40,560
Scoundrel!

606
00:40:40,560 --> 00:40:42,040
Beast!

607
00:40:42,040 --> 00:40:43,920
- Order! 
 - Beast!

608
00:40:43,920 --> 00:40:46,440
You must not be reckless in the hall of justice.

609
00:40:47,800 --> 00:40:49,760
Madam, the Great Chief could not come in person.

610
00:40:49,760 --> 00:40:52,680
He sent me to present the evidence of this case before the court.

611
00:40:54,240 --> 00:40:57,100
There's evidence? There's a backup plan?

612
00:40:57,100 --> 00:40:59,200
Why didn't you report it earlier?

613
00:40:59,200 --> 00:41:00,600
I am not your subordinate.

614
00:41:00,600 --> 00:41:03,040
Why should I report everything to you?

615
00:41:04,120 --> 00:41:05,880
True to being his subordinate.

616
00:41:05,880 --> 00:41:07,480
Really petty.

617
00:41:07,480 --> 00:41:10,960
Xu Jize, at this point, what more do you have to say?

618
00:41:10,960 --> 00:41:13,320
My Lord, I'm truly wronged.

619
00:41:13,320 --> 00:41:16,500
On the wedding day, the bride often goes without food the whole day.

620
00:41:16,500 --> 00:41:18,840
It's common for them to faint from exhaustion.

621
00:41:18,840 --> 00:41:20,720
As soon as I saw the bride was weak,

622
00:41:20,720 --> 00:41:22,960
to avoid suspicion, I immediately left the room.

623
00:41:22,960 --> 00:41:25,880
Then the criminal kidnapped the bride.

624
00:41:25,880 --> 00:41:27,400
Only then did I chase after him.

625
00:41:27,400 --> 00:41:29,920
Still making excuses.

626
00:41:29,920 --> 00:41:31,320
What happened after you chased after him?

627
00:41:31,320 --> 00:41:32,880
What did you see? Tell us.

628
00:41:32,880 --> 00:41:34,880
I don't know how far I chased.

629
00:41:34,880 --> 00:41:38,380
Then I saw a shadow wielding a knife.

630
00:41:38,380 --> 00:41:41,380
The person who kidnapped Miss Du collapsed right beside him.

631
00:41:41,380 --> 00:41:44,280
I am a mere scholar without much strength.

632
00:41:44,280 --> 00:41:47,040
I dared not to confront him directly.

633
00:41:47,040 --> 00:41:49,920
So I turned around and ran until I met all of you esteemed ones.

634
00:41:49,920 --> 00:41:52,360
That's how I managed to save my own life.

635
00:42:01,800 --> 00:42:04,540
My Lord, what is this for?

636
00:42:04,540 --> 00:42:07,040
Men and women should not touch each other.

637
00:42:07,040 --> 00:42:11,180
The embroidery on your clothes is really exquisite.

638
00:42:11,180 --> 00:42:13,600
I wonder which young lady

639
00:42:13,600 --> 00:42:17,740
embroidered this peach blossom pattern at the neckline for you.
