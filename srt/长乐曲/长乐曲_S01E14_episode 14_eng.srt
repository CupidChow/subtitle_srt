00:00:26,920 --> 00:00:31,990
 "Go Ahead Fearlessly" - Liu Yuning 

3
00:00:31,990 --> 00:00:35,028
â™«  Grudges and karma, right and wrong  â™«

4
00:00:35,028 --> 00:00:38,226
â™«  The past hides blood and tears  â™«

5
00:00:38,226 --> 00:00:40,695
â™«  It is hard to catch up after years of separation  â™«

6
00:00:40,695 --> 00:00:44,470
â™«  The truth cannot be fully revealed  â™«

7
00:00:44,470 --> 00:00:47,605
â™«  Fate is full of twists and turns  â™«

8
00:00:47,605 --> 00:00:50,870
â™«  Life and death, fortune and misfortune go hand in hand  â™«

9
00:00:50,870 --> 00:00:55,906
â™«  Obsession is hard to get rid of, keeping the truth 
 and getting rid of the lies, let the wind blow  â™«

10
00:00:55,906 --> 00:01:02,278
â™«  Tossed about by the wind and rain, I will never regret it, 
 I will accompany you for my whole life  â™«

11
00:01:02,278 --> 00:01:08,586
â™«  At least you share my joy and sorrow  â™«

12
00:01:08,586 --> 00:01:14,865
â™«  Unravelling fate, fearlessly, a dream returns  â™«

13
00:01:14,865 --> 00:01:21,178
â™«  The mountains and rivers are bright and beautiful, 
 holding hands, together we return  â™«

14
00:01:21,178 --> 00:01:28,922
â™«  In this life, my heart returns untainted of dust and ash  â™«

15
00:01:28,922 --> 00:01:37,256
   

16
00:01:37,256 --> 00:01:40,291
   

17
00:02:01,180 --> 00:02:03,088
Great Chief.

18
00:02:11,600 --> 00:02:14,900
What brings you here?

19
00:02:20,460 --> 00:02:24,240
There are too many lanterns here and too bright.

20
00:02:24,240 --> 00:02:27,060
Over here, put it here.

21
00:02:27,060 --> 00:02:29,820
The Great Chief's residence is always like this?

22
00:02:30,740 --> 00:02:33,980
The Shen Mansion is much brighter than this.

23
00:02:37,700 --> 00:02:40,060
Great Chief, come on.

24
00:02:49,060 --> 00:02:53,480
Young Master Han, on such a night with a full moon,

25
00:02:53,480 --> 00:02:57,880
do you also think of your own family like I do?

26
00:03:03,400 --> 00:03:07,200
Iâ€¦ lost my parents at a young age.

27
00:03:07,200 --> 00:03:09,500
I have had no family for a long time.

28
00:03:10,900 --> 00:03:15,000
Once I marry Caiwei, the Yan family will be my family.

29
00:03:16,700 --> 00:03:18,532
Right.

30
00:03:20,080 --> 00:03:24,540
Your parents have gone, what about your siblings?

31
00:03:26,180 --> 00:03:30,760
Marriage is a significant matter. Out of courtesy, you must inform them. Right?

32
00:03:32,500 --> 00:03:35,640
Before getting married, the two families should meet.

33
00:03:35,640 --> 00:03:37,960
- Right. 
 - No need.

34
00:03:41,020 --> 00:03:45,400
I left home to study at a young age, and I've long lost contact with my relatives.

35
00:03:45,400 --> 00:03:48,160
As long as Caiwei and I truly love each other, that's enough.

36
00:03:48,160 --> 00:03:51,500
I don't care about those tedious formalities.

37
00:03:54,200 --> 00:03:59,640
Really? Why do I think that these tedious formalities are necessary?

38
00:04:01,720 --> 00:04:03,950
Even if you two truly love each other,

39
00:04:03,950 --> 00:04:08,040
you would also hope to get recognition and blessings from your friends and family.

40
00:04:09,900 --> 00:04:12,060
Moreover, the more important thing is...

41
00:04:12,060 --> 00:04:17,080
you'll get to know both family backgrounds from this meeting,

42
00:04:20,050 --> 00:04:22,340
so as not to be deceived.

43
00:04:30,200 --> 00:04:31,970
Right.

44
00:04:32,820 --> 00:04:36,960
When I married you, we didn't have these formalities.

45
00:04:36,960 --> 00:04:41,680
Young Master Han truly loves Third Sister. That's what matters.

46
00:04:56,220 --> 00:05:00,160
It's getting late, and a bit chilly.

47
00:05:00,160 --> 00:05:04,100
Well, let's head back to rest.

48
00:05:14,800 --> 00:05:16,780
Yes, let's go.

49
00:05:16,780 --> 00:05:18,220
Right.

50
00:05:18,220 --> 00:05:23,080
Great Chief, we will head back to rest now. Let's go.

51
00:05:23,080 --> 00:05:25,000
Young Master Han.

52
00:05:26,340 --> 00:05:29,340
If you really love her so much,

53
00:05:29,340 --> 00:05:33,780
then try to be sincere and face the challenge together.

54
00:05:39,060 --> 00:05:41,620
Young Master Han, let's go.

55
00:05:46,620 --> 00:05:52,180
What do you want to do? You insist on having a meal here and scare everyone away.

56
00:05:54,620 --> 00:05:57,000
I don't want to tell you.

57
00:05:57,000 --> 00:06:00,280
I shouldn't be the one to tell you.

58
00:06:00,280 --> 00:06:03,740
You're mystifying things!

59
00:06:40,760 --> 00:06:43,840
It's getting late. Let's go back.

60
00:06:43,840 --> 00:06:47,080
It's too late to go back.

61
00:06:47,080 --> 00:06:48,988
- Thenâ€¦ 
  - Great Chief. 

62
00:06:50,060 --> 00:06:55,520
Great Chief, Master has already prepared a bedroom for you two.

63
00:06:55,520 --> 00:07:00,620
Since Father has already prepared a bedroom for me, then I won't go back.

64
00:07:00,620 --> 00:07:03,060
Husband, you can just go.

65
00:07:12,340 --> 00:07:14,620
What are you doing?

66
00:07:14,620 --> 00:07:19,380
What? He said the bedroom is for the two of us.

67
00:07:19,380 --> 00:07:23,680
If you stay, then how are you going to explain this tomorrow?

68
00:07:23,680 --> 00:07:26,500
If you're not leaving, at least put me down first.

69
00:07:26,500 --> 00:07:29,240
It's not nice to be seen.

70
00:07:29,240 --> 00:07:34,660
So what? I just want others to see how close we are.

71
00:07:34,660 --> 00:07:36,940
So you'll be spared from explaining.

72
00:07:40,160 --> 00:07:41,928
Wait!

73
00:07:44,740 --> 00:07:46,676
Go back to rest!

74
00:07:54,040 --> 00:07:55,892
All right.

75
00:07:58,360 --> 00:08:01,920
Now drop the play. It's time to sleep.

76
00:08:05,280 --> 00:08:08,040
Yan Mansion is not like Shen Mansion.

77
00:08:08,040 --> 00:08:10,920
Tonight, you'll just make do there.

78
00:08:22,560 --> 00:08:26,600
I am someone with injuries. Making me sleep on a bamboo chair...

79
00:08:27,660 --> 00:08:29,060
is inappropriate.

80
00:08:29,060 --> 00:08:31,180
Who told you toâ€¦

81
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:36,060
You look even healthier than me.

82
00:08:39,960 --> 00:08:43,280
Forget it. You can have the bed.

83
00:09:42,900 --> 00:09:47,520
If you want to stay, there's still half a spot inside. You can sleep on the inside.

84
00:09:47,520 --> 00:09:49,720
If you don't want to,

85
00:09:52,480 --> 00:09:57,420
you can go outside and spend the whole night with the stars.

86
00:10:15,640 --> 00:10:18,680
Today, let's make do.

87
00:10:18,680 --> 00:10:24,020
But we have to follow the rules. No one is supposed to cross this blanket.

88
00:11:26,780 --> 00:11:28,860
I can't sleep.

89
00:11:28,860 --> 00:11:32,320
I might as well go outside and spend the night with the stars.

90
00:12:13,560 --> 00:12:15,600
Why are you here?

91
00:12:15,600 --> 00:12:18,340
I've given you the room.

92
00:12:24,200 --> 00:12:25,900
The candles in the room have gone out.

93
00:12:25,900 --> 00:12:28,420
It's too dark in the room for me to sleep.

94
00:12:34,140 --> 00:12:36,760
Get someone to light the candles.

95
00:12:36,760 --> 00:12:40,800
Shen Du, you just have to bother others in the middle of the night, don't you?

96
00:12:40,800 --> 00:12:43,060
You weren't asleep when the candles were lit.

97
00:12:43,060 --> 00:12:46,160
You're tossing and turning, keeping me from sleeping.

98
00:12:48,800 --> 00:12:51,800
Because the candles weren't bright enough when they were lit,

99
00:12:56,080 --> 00:12:58,084
it's still a bit dim.

100
00:13:00,480 --> 00:13:03,360
You're a really weird guy.

101
00:13:03,360 --> 00:13:06,960
My father even lit a few more candles. And you still complain about the darkness.

102
00:13:06,960 --> 00:13:10,480
You're sleeping, not reading or writing. Why do you need it to be as bright as day?

103
00:13:10,480 --> 00:13:12,980
Are you blind or something?

104
00:13:17,080 --> 00:13:20,000
 Now I understand why Shen Du is called White Ghost. 

105
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:22,120
 Just look at these. 

106
00:13:22,120 --> 00:13:24,120
 In broad daylight, it's like a memorial hall. 

107
00:13:24,120 --> 00:13:28,300
 When evening comes, it is still as brightly lit as day. 

108
00:13:28,300 --> 00:13:30,100
 Who beats someone up with a lantern in hand? 

109
00:13:30,100 --> 00:13:32,200
 I can't do it without a lantern. 

110
00:13:33,360 --> 00:13:35,552
 Does he... 

111
00:14:11,520 --> 00:14:14,260
 have night blindness? 

112
00:14:26,200 --> 00:14:28,340
Tonight is truly rare.

113
00:14:28,340 --> 00:14:33,720
The seven stars of the Azure Dragon in the east,

114
00:14:34,500 --> 00:14:39,300
and the seven stars of the Vermilion Bird in the south.

115
00:14:41,160 --> 00:14:43,200
All of them are visible.

116
00:14:47,560 --> 00:14:48,880
Look over there.

117
00:14:48,880 --> 00:14:53,860
Those four stars over there are connected, do they look like the four corners of a square?

118
00:14:56,040 --> 00:14:58,820
Those four stars over there are the Di (Earth) and Tu (Mole) stars.

119
00:14:58,820 --> 00:15:02,380
And below them are four more, which are the Jiao (Horn) and Mu (Wood) stars.

120
00:15:02,380 --> 00:15:04,520
 Indeed, he cannot see. 

121
00:15:04,520 --> 00:15:07,360
 There are no stars over there at all. 

122
00:15:09,900 --> 00:15:12,320
You know so many names of the stars.

123
00:15:12,320 --> 00:15:14,800
You are really impressive.

124
00:15:15,760 --> 00:15:21,400
Well, those over there. What's the name of those stars over there that look like a rabbit?

125
00:15:27,760 --> 00:15:30,400
Those are the Biyue (Black Moon) and Wu (Crow) stars.

126
00:15:30,400 --> 00:15:34,080
What about this one over here? I think this one looks like a glutinous rice cake.

127
00:15:34,080 --> 00:15:38,880
And those in the south. Those in the south look like a cherry.

128
00:15:38,880 --> 00:15:40,800
It is called the Jing (Well) and Mu (Wood) stars.

129
00:15:40,800 --> 00:15:43,600
It doesn't sound good. Change the name.

130
00:15:44,400 --> 00:15:48,200
I thinkâ€¦ it should be called...

131
00:15:48,200 --> 00:15:49,800
Cherry Biluo Star.

132
00:15:49,800 --> 00:15:52,680
The one next to it is Glutinous Rice Cake Star.

133
00:15:52,680 --> 00:15:54,500
It doesn't sound good.

134
00:15:54,500 --> 00:15:56,520
Such strange names.

135
00:15:56,520 --> 00:15:58,400
And they are all pastries.

136
00:15:58,400 --> 00:16:01,700
You wouldn't understand this, but it's better to name them after food.

137
00:16:01,700 --> 00:16:03,960
When I was little, I had a poor appetite.

138
00:16:03,960 --> 00:16:07,620
So, my mother would name the stars in the sky all after pastries.

139
00:16:07,620 --> 00:16:11,000
She even tricked me by saying that whichever star was shining, then I had to eat more of that kind of pastry.

140
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:14,640
Otherwise, that star would never shine again.

141
00:16:16,240 --> 00:16:20,400
 Today, you must eat more glutinous rice cakes. 

142
00:16:21,200 --> 00:16:24,280
 Because today, the star that looks like a glutinous rice cake is shining. 

143
00:16:24,280 --> 00:16:27,940
 My mother said, if not, then... 

144
00:16:27,940 --> 00:16:30,720
 the star that looks like a glutinous rice cake will go out. 

145
00:16:30,720 --> 00:16:32,692
 Eat up. 

146
00:16:35,796 --> 00:16:38,948
â™«  Heart burned, a withered body, a lifetime of solitude  â™«

147
00:16:38,948 --> 00:16:42,708
â™«  Heart burned, a withered body, a lifetime of solitude  â™«

148
00:16:42,708 --> 00:16:45,950
â™«  Passion burned, where it scattered, where it mottled  â™«

149
00:16:45,950 --> 00:16:49,380
â™«  Passion burned, where it scattered, where it mottled  â™«

150
00:16:49,389 --> 00:16:52,200
â™«  Drifting in the mist, amidst the vast misty waves, groping in the dark  â™«

151
00:16:52,200 --> 00:16:57,800
â™«  Drifting in the mist, amidst the vast misty waves, groping in the dark  â™«

152
00:16:57,800 --> 00:17:03,061
â™«  You passing by, igniting fireworks  â™«

153
00:17:03,840 --> 00:17:06,759
W-What are you doing?

154
00:17:06,759 --> 00:17:08,660
 Could it be... 

155
00:17:08,660 --> 00:17:11,027
 you? 

156
00:17:11,027 --> 00:17:17,640
â™«  Love is complicated, it hurts you and burns me  â™«

157

158
00:17:22,459 --> 00:17:26,003
â™«  The lights will intersect  â™«

00:17:26,003 --> 00:17:31,571

00:17:38,771 --> 00:17:41,791
â™«  Who can save me from my confusion and persistence?  â™«

00:18:03,049 --> 00:18:06,962
â™«  Through the sea of people, just hold me tight  â™«

169
00:18:06,962 --> 00:18:10,118
â™«  Who can save me from grudges and karma?  â™«

170
00:18:10,118 --> 00:18:14,082
â™«  Soothe my sense of loss, never to escape  â™«

172

00:18:24,215 --> 00:18:31,017

174
00:18:31,017 --> 00:18:32,872
Great Chief.

175
00:18:53,980 --> 00:18:58,800
- What's the matter? 
 - Early this morning, Young Master Han went to find Master, saying to announce something.

176
00:18:58,800 --> 00:19:01,900
He asked me to invite you and Madam.

177
00:19:01,900 --> 00:19:03,636
Okay.

178
00:19:05,180 --> 00:19:08,080
We're on our way.

179
00:19:17,920 --> 00:19:20,420
- Great Chief. 
 - Don't bother.

180
00:19:21,300 --> 00:19:23,840
Great Chief, you are here.

181
00:19:23,840 --> 00:19:26,880
Thank you for giving me the chance to confess.

182
00:19:26,880 --> 00:19:30,580
Young Master Han, what exactly do you want to say?

183
00:19:35,100 --> 00:19:36,750
Caiwei.

184
00:19:37,360 --> 00:19:39,200
I lied to you.

185
00:19:40,200 --> 00:19:42,300
My parents still have a son alive.

186
00:19:42,300 --> 00:19:44,560
He is the Grand Empress Dowager's favored official,

187
00:19:44,560 --> 00:19:48,780
Zhang Baohuan, the Minister of Rites.

188
00:19:51,920 --> 00:19:54,220
Minister Zhang?

189
00:19:58,640 --> 00:20:00,540
But I don't understand.

190
00:20:00,540 --> 00:20:02,760
Since you are Minister Zhang's brother,

191
00:20:02,760 --> 00:20:05,040
why didn't he use his connections to protect you

192
00:20:05,040 --> 00:20:08,080
from persecution by the Princess of Valor?

193
00:20:08,080 --> 00:20:10,480
Younger Brotherâ€¦

194
00:20:10,480 --> 00:20:14,000
In fact, the Princess of Valor knew about my relationship with Zhang Baohuan.

195
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:16,720
With the intention of competing with the Grand Empress Dowager,

196
00:20:16,720 --> 00:20:19,400
she sought to make me her paramour.

197
00:20:22,680 --> 00:20:25,000
I rejected her many times,

198
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:26,900
but still found it hard to escape.

199
00:20:26,900 --> 00:20:28,800
Though we are born of the same mother,

200
00:20:28,800 --> 00:20:31,360
he does not deserve to be my elder brother...

201
00:20:32,840 --> 00:20:35,500
because he failed to protect our sister.

202
00:20:35,500 --> 00:20:37,392
Sister?

203
00:20:42,040 --> 00:20:44,580
The owner of Jinxiu Workshop back then

204
00:20:44,580 --> 00:20:47,320
was your sister, Zhang Baoying?

205
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:54,900
Caiwei, I'm sorry.

206
00:20:54,900 --> 00:20:57,300
I lied to you.

207
00:20:58,440 --> 00:21:00,560
When the incident at Jinxiu Workshop occurred,

208
00:21:00,560 --> 00:21:02,720
the Zhang family was executed to the last.

209
00:21:02,720 --> 00:21:05,720
Yet Zhang Baohuan used his connections to save me.

210
00:21:05,720 --> 00:21:07,720
I can't figure out

211
00:21:07,720 --> 00:21:11,520
why he couldn't save our sister if he could save me.

212
00:21:11,520 --> 00:21:14,240
I hate that he didn't protect our sister,

213
00:21:14,240 --> 00:21:17,200
and hate myself for being incompetent.

214
00:21:17,200 --> 00:21:21,160
Since then, I made up my mind...

215
00:21:21,920 --> 00:21:24,640
to have nothing to do with the Zhang family anymore.

216
00:21:24,640 --> 00:21:28,560
My mother's surname is Han, so I took her surname

217
00:21:28,560 --> 00:21:30,920
and renamed myself Han Shiyuan.

218
00:21:37,840 --> 00:21:41,240
Maybe he had a compelling reason too.

219
00:21:41,240 --> 00:21:45,820
You should know how difficult life he is living by the side of the Grand Empress Dowager.

220
00:21:45,820 --> 00:21:47,640
Being a companion to the ruler is like being with a tiger.

221
00:21:47,640 --> 00:21:51,220
I think you should understand it.

222
00:21:56,120 --> 00:21:59,240
You'd never seen how bloody that scene was.

223
00:21:59,980 --> 00:22:02,660
How can you truly empathize with me?

224
00:22:10,660 --> 00:22:12,840
   
 Don't be afraid. 

225
00:22:25,800 --> 00:22:28,340
I will never forget that day.

226
00:22:28,960 --> 00:22:31,060
If you were me,

227
00:22:32,020 --> 00:22:34,500
you wouldn't be able to say such words.

228
00:22:46,420 --> 00:22:48,260
You are wrong.

229
00:22:49,120 --> 00:22:51,600
They died uncleared of a false charge,

230
00:22:51,600 --> 00:22:55,720
so you should try your best to seek justice for them,

231
00:22:55,720 --> 00:22:58,480
instead of lying to yourself...

232
00:23:00,560 --> 00:23:03,120
and distancing yourself from them.

233
00:23:09,880 --> 00:23:12,480
What a twisted fate!

234
00:23:15,780 --> 00:23:19,000
What a twisted fate!

235
00:23:45,120 --> 00:23:47,276
Young Master Han.

236
00:23:49,100 --> 00:23:54,740
Allow me to think more about the marriage between you and my daughter.

237
00:23:54,740 --> 00:23:57,280
I hope you will understand.

238
00:23:57,280 --> 00:24:01,840
The Yan Mansion is not strong,

239
00:24:01,840 --> 00:24:05,720
it truly cannot withstand any more turmoil.

240
00:24:16,900 --> 00:24:19,260
Today, I tell you the truth,

241
00:24:19,910 --> 00:24:22,640
I'm well aware of the consequences.

242
00:24:25,220 --> 00:24:27,220
I did not sleep all night.

243
00:24:27,940 --> 00:24:31,260
I realized I couldn't lie to Caiwei...

244
00:24:32,480 --> 00:24:34,480
and marry her.

245
00:24:34,480 --> 00:24:36,960
Staying here these days...

246
00:24:37,850 --> 00:24:39,340
has bothered you a lot.

247
00:24:39,340 --> 00:24:41,210
I'll...

248
00:24:42,290 --> 00:24:44,170
take my leave.

249
00:24:49,440 --> 00:24:51,380
Young Master Han.

250
00:24:51,380 --> 00:24:54,480
Caiwei! Caiwei!

251
00:25:30,840 --> 00:25:35,280
Young Master Han is indeed Minister Zhang's family.

252
00:25:37,660 --> 00:25:42,400
The Jinxiu Workshop case involves the royal past and the close servant of the Grand Empress Dowager.

253
00:25:42,400 --> 00:25:46,100
Connections are extensive. Be very cautious!

254
00:25:46,100 --> 00:25:49,320
Understood, I will be careful.

255
00:25:52,900 --> 00:25:57,180
Actually, there is one more thing.

256
00:25:57,820 --> 00:26:02,720
Back then, in the detention center, there was a little girl who often came to see me at midnight.

257
00:26:02,720 --> 00:26:05,920
She brought me food and news from the outside.

258
00:26:06,520 --> 00:26:11,140
But after a certain day, she was never seen again.

259
00:26:11,760 --> 00:26:14,880
I thought I'd never see her again.

260
00:26:15,620 --> 00:26:17,480
But yesterday,

261
00:26:19,380 --> 00:26:21,740
I seemed to have found her.

262
00:26:23,480 --> 00:26:28,740
Or perhaps, someone just like her.

263
00:26:28,740 --> 00:26:33,340
Many years ago, you asked me to check the detention center's entry and exit records

264
00:26:33,340 --> 00:26:36,480
specifically to find her. Right?

265
00:26:37,260 --> 00:26:40,360
But in the records, there was no entry of a little girl.

266
00:26:40,360 --> 00:26:45,100
So I couldn't help but wonder whether she was real

267
00:26:45,100 --> 00:26:47,800
or merely a figure in my dreams.

268
00:26:47,800 --> 00:26:53,320
If she did come and go at night, then she might not be recorded.

269
00:26:54,560 --> 00:27:00,120
That detention center was also where I was confined in my youth.

270
00:27:00,120 --> 00:27:03,920
Thinking back now, I still often have nightmares.

271
00:27:04,720 --> 00:27:08,480
She dared to go into the detention center at night to care for you.

272
00:27:08,480 --> 00:27:10,850
She must be a kind-hearted woman.

273
00:27:11,680 --> 00:27:17,520
If fate brings you together again, make sure to tell her this and treat her well.

274
00:27:22,780 --> 00:27:27,580
If fate indeed brings us together again, there's no need to tell her this.

275
00:27:27,580 --> 00:27:31,600
As I am now the well-known ruthless official in Great Cang,

276
00:27:31,600 --> 00:27:35,460
being so ruthless and with a vicious dog that bites people.

277
00:27:36,240 --> 00:27:39,240
I'm too ashamed to face my childhood playmate again.

278
00:27:39,240 --> 00:27:41,840
A vicious dog that bites people?

279
00:27:41,840 --> 00:27:44,240
You're talking about that time at Ming Hall?

280
00:27:44,240 --> 00:27:46,960
If you hadn't let out that vicious dog to screen criminals,

281
00:27:46,960 --> 00:27:51,380
I'm afraid that everyone below would have perished under arrows.

282
00:27:52,080 --> 00:27:56,980
Madam Xu, you have been living in the palace, yet know everything. Even the affairs outside the palace.

283
00:27:56,980 --> 00:28:02,020
Don't flatter me so. Everyone in Xiang'an City knows this.

284
00:28:02,020 --> 00:28:06,520
This became another tally under your reputation as White Ghost.

285
00:28:11,420 --> 00:28:13,090
Shen Du,

286
00:28:13,760 --> 00:28:18,600
bearing such a notorious name, do you think it is worth it?

287
00:28:25,600 --> 00:28:29,620
Yan Xing! You overstepped your authority again!

288
00:28:32,680 --> 00:28:37,120
And yet you still deny it?

289
00:28:37,120 --> 00:28:42,960
This is the encrypted file sent by the Imperial Guards, designated for you to read only.

290
00:28:42,960 --> 00:28:48,940
Originally, cases from the Imperial Guards were to be assigned to you.

291
00:28:50,420 --> 00:28:53,260
However, by law, they must be archived first and then assigned from the top down.

292
00:28:53,260 --> 00:28:56,680
There's no reason to go over me and straight into your hands.

293
00:28:57,380 --> 00:29:03,200
Regarding this matter, you mustâ€¦ remind the Imperial Guards.

294
00:29:06,540 --> 00:29:11,580
All right, Director Wu. I will tell them all the files and evidence that are sent over

295
00:29:11,580 --> 00:29:14,960
must be reviewed and assigned by you.

296
00:29:14,960 --> 00:29:17,080
That's more like it.

297
00:29:32,720 --> 00:29:36,920
What is this? Is this a code using landmarks?

298
00:29:37,760 --> 00:29:40,500
Jushengnu Stars?

299
00:29:40,500 --> 00:29:43,480
   

300
00:29:43,480 --> 00:29:47,560
Glutinous Rice Cake Star.

301
00:29:47,560 --> 00:29:49,612
Cherryâ€¦

302
00:29:55,520 --> 00:30:00,860
This must be the work of my husband, who has recently taken an interest in astronomy.

303
00:30:00,860 --> 00:30:04,780
While observing, he has drawn maps of the stars

304
00:30:04,780 --> 00:30:08,940
and presented them to the Ministry of Justice for use in our investigations.

305
00:30:08,940 --> 00:30:11,680
Nonsense.

306
00:30:11,680 --> 00:30:13,840
Are these things of any use to us? Any at all?

307
00:30:13,840 --> 00:30:16,960
This is the Ministry of Justice, not the Astronomical Bureau.

308
00:30:16,960 --> 00:30:21,460
Nonsense. Do they think that we are idle?

309
00:30:30,420 --> 00:30:34,220
 Without eating pastries, you can still retain a sky full of stars. 

310
00:30:34,220 --> 00:30:39,300
 He has remembered all the positions and names I spouted last night. 

311
00:30:39,300 --> 00:30:43,820
 Shen Du, I will find a way to cure your night blindness. 

312
00:30:52,694 --> 00:30:55,532
   

313
00:31:06,440 --> 00:31:08,940
 One can see things during the day. 

314
00:31:08,940 --> 00:31:12,160
 When dusk falls, one can't see anything. 

315
00:31:12,160 --> 00:31:14,380
 It is called Night Blindness. 

316
00:31:14,380 --> 00:31:18,480
 Suggest nourishing the liver and replenishing blood. 

317
00:31:28,660 --> 00:31:33,760
Did Madam ask to prepare offal to make three meals a day for Master?

318
00:31:51,300 --> 00:31:53,760
Are you cooking?

319
00:31:58,820 --> 00:32:02,160
You look like you're doing witchcraft to me.

320
00:32:02,160 --> 00:32:05,200
What are you all gathered around here for?

321
00:32:10,820 --> 00:32:14,200
Dismissed, everyone. Don't you have things to do?

322
00:32:14,200 --> 00:32:16,680
Pipewort Flower.

323
00:32:18,300 --> 00:32:20,480
Go and get busy.

324
00:32:20,480 --> 00:32:22,560
All right.

325
00:32:22,560 --> 00:32:25,440
Hurry. Come with me.

326
00:32:31,880 --> 00:32:34,180
Faeces Vespertilionis.

327
00:32:58,780 --> 00:33:00,640
My Lord.

328
00:33:00,640 --> 00:33:06,200
This is what Madam cooked for you, sheep liver soup.

329
00:34:57,700 --> 00:35:01,500
Great Chief, Madam said tha at noon you have to have this

330
00:35:01,500 --> 00:35:03,480
steamed Pipewort Flower, Faeces Vespertilionis, and chicken liver.

331
00:35:03,480 --> 00:35:05,360
Again?

332
00:35:06,220 --> 00:35:08,860
Again and again?

333
00:35:09,700 --> 00:35:11,672
I'm not eating.

334
00:35:21,820 --> 00:35:24,400
 I know why you keep the lanterns lit at night. 

335
00:35:24,400 --> 00:35:26,360
 If you wish to see the starry sky, 

336
00:35:26,360 --> 00:35:28,440
 you must eat all three meals a day. 

337
00:35:28,440 --> 00:35:31,760
 If you do not, read the second note. 

338
00:35:36,320 --> 00:35:39,520
 If you don't want the entire Xiang'an City to know your secret, 

339
00:35:39,520 --> 00:35:42,360
 then receive proper nourishment and treatment from me. 

340
00:35:53,740 --> 00:35:55,600
What did you just say this thing is called?

341
00:35:55,600 --> 00:36:00,970
Steamed Pipewort Flower, Faeces Vespertilionum,

342
00:36:00,970 --> 00:36:03,660
and chicken liver.

343
00:36:03,660 --> 00:36:05,680
I know what Pipewort Flower is.

344
00:36:05,680 --> 00:36:09,020
But what is the Faeces Vespertilionum?

345
00:36:09,020 --> 00:36:13,160
Great Chief, are you sure you want me to tell you?

346
00:36:13,920 --> 00:36:16,080
What exactly is it?

347
00:36:16,080 --> 00:36:18,360
Bat droppings.

348
00:36:23,580 --> 00:36:25,480
Sixth...

349
00:36:25,480 --> 00:36:26,820
Missâ€¦

350
00:36:26,820 --> 00:36:28,780
Yan!

351
00:36:29,340 --> 00:36:32,860
Great Chief, let's not eat it then.

352
00:36:46,360 --> 00:36:48,540
You go to the Ministry of Justice

353
00:36:48,540 --> 00:36:52,140
and bring her here.

354
00:37:12,137 --> 00:37:16,170
   

355
00:37:20,600 --> 00:37:22,820
Madam, be careful!

356
00:37:22,820 --> 00:37:25,680
Great Chief was in a bad mood after eating the chicken liver.

357
00:37:29,800 --> 00:37:32,160
I'm going to watch the training.

358
00:37:38,820 --> 00:37:40,480
What are you looking at?

359
00:37:41,260 --> 00:37:42,980
And you?

360
00:37:45,800 --> 00:37:50,180
Sixth Miss Yan, if you want to kill your husband, just stab me with a sword.

361
00:37:50,180 --> 00:37:51,640
Why beat around the bush?

362
00:37:51,640 --> 00:37:54,800
Making these nauseating soups.

363
00:37:54,800 --> 00:37:57,980
Shen Du, you misjudged my good intentions!

364
00:37:57,980 --> 00:38:01,340
This is a recipe I found in medical books.

365
00:38:01,340 --> 00:38:05,040
It's written that those with night blindness should take

366
00:38:05,040 --> 00:38:06,680
substances that nourish the liver and the eyes.

367
00:38:06,680 --> 00:38:08,460
Such as animal offal, andâ€¦

368
00:38:08,460 --> 00:38:11,220
It's not just animal offal, but also animal droppings.

369
00:38:11,220 --> 00:38:13,460
What animal droppings?

370
00:38:19,600 --> 00:38:22,140
Are you talking about...

371
00:38:23,540 --> 00:38:25,688
Faeces Vespertilionum?

372
00:38:32,680 --> 00:38:38,840
That steamed Pipewort Flower, Faeces Vespertilionum, and chicken liver...

373
00:38:39,660 --> 00:38:41,960
is...

374
00:38:42,660 --> 00:38:45,120
recorded in the Treatise on the Origins of Various Diseases.

375
00:38:45,120 --> 00:38:48,420
Faeces Vespertilionum is one of the most important medicinal ingredients.

376
00:38:48,420 --> 00:38:51,660
Butler Shen bought it after going through all the city's drugstores.

377
00:38:51,660 --> 00:38:53,340
And I steamed it all night.

378
00:38:53,340 --> 00:38:55,800
My good intentions are taken for donkey's liver and lungs. 
  (You mistake my good intentions for something worthless.) 

379
00:38:55,800 --> 00:38:58,320
Don't ever mention the word "liver" again!

380
00:39:01,200 --> 00:39:03,400
Good medicine is often bitter to the taste.

381
00:39:03,400 --> 00:39:06,260
Venting like this doesn't make any sense.

382
00:39:06,260 --> 00:39:07,760
Iâ€¦

383
00:39:07,760 --> 00:39:10,240
If you have nothing important to say, I'll go back to my department.

384
00:39:10,240 --> 00:39:12,300
Chen Shoujie has been recuperating at the medical hall these past few days,

385
00:39:12,300 --> 00:39:14,900
sometimes lucid, sometimes dull.

386
00:39:16,420 --> 00:39:18,620
I have already brought him to the Imperial Guards.

387
00:39:18,620 --> 00:39:22,040
If you want to question him, come with me.

388
00:39:51,320 --> 00:39:54,300
Master Chen, can you tell me what exactly happened?

389
00:39:54,300 --> 00:39:57,960
Why are there Jinxiu Workshop's works in your house?

390
00:40:06,760 --> 00:40:08,880
She's my concubine.

391
00:40:08,880 --> 00:40:11,980
Previously at Jinxiu Workshop, she also worked as an embroideress

392
00:40:11,980 --> 00:40:13,760
and even had apprentices.

393
00:40:13,760 --> 00:40:16,940
Her craftsmanship was truly exquisite.

394
00:40:17,880 --> 00:40:21,760
When Jinxiu Workshop got involved in a case, she just happened to be out.

395
00:40:21,760 --> 00:40:24,140
Afterward, the imperial court searched for the remaining party,

396
00:40:24,140 --> 00:40:26,240
and she was hiding everywhere

397
00:40:26,240 --> 00:40:28,900
and met me.

398
00:40:28,900 --> 00:40:33,680
I appreciated her merits, so I took her in as a concubine.

399
00:40:33,680 --> 00:40:38,300
She made these embroidery works

400
00:40:38,300 --> 00:40:41,420
in her leisure time.

401
00:40:51,340 --> 00:40:53,160
Fire!

402
00:40:54,360 --> 00:40:56,100
Fire!

403
00:40:56,870 --> 00:41:01,400
I don't think we can get any clue from him.

404
00:41:09,820 --> 00:41:13,060
So, Madam Chen was once an embroideress at the Jinxiu Workshop.

405
00:41:13,060 --> 00:41:17,780
So, the murderer wanted to eliminate all those

406
00:41:17,780 --> 00:41:19,520
related to the Jinxiu Workshop case?

407
00:41:19,520 --> 00:41:22,680
If that's the case, does it mean that

408
00:41:22,680 --> 00:41:26,280
the Jinxiu Workshop case has a big secret?

409
00:41:26,280 --> 00:41:30,160
A secret that the murderer would kill people to keep it quiet.

410
00:41:30,160 --> 00:41:33,420
But right now it's all speculation. We have no evidence.

411
00:41:33,420 --> 00:41:36,240
Indeed. Further investigation is required.

412
00:41:36,240 --> 00:41:38,640
And it should be a targeted investigation.

413
00:41:38,640 --> 00:41:41,340
I have decided to write an application today

414
00:41:41,340 --> 00:41:43,120
and submit it to the Ministry of Justice tomorrow,

415
00:41:43,120 --> 00:41:47,840
to apply for a combined investigation of the Chen Huo'e case and the Jinxiu Workshop case.

416
00:41:47,840 --> 00:41:49,500
I'm afraid it will be difficult.

417
00:41:49,500 --> 00:41:51,700
These two cases involve too many people.

418
00:41:51,700 --> 00:41:53,360
None of them want the old cases to be brought up again,

419
00:41:53,360 --> 00:41:55,560
so they will do everything they can to obstruct the investigation.

420
00:41:55,560 --> 00:41:59,060
But if we don't try, we'll never know the results.

421
00:42:04,220 --> 00:42:05,400
What's going on?

422
00:42:05,400 --> 00:42:07,180
The people from the Princess of Valor's mansion are making things difficult for Han Shiyuan

423
00:42:07,180 --> 00:42:09,040
and blocking our way.

424
00:42:13,820 --> 00:42:16,760
Young Master Han, Princess of Valor invites you to come.

425
00:42:18,240 --> 00:42:20,800
Wait. Don't act rashly.

426
00:42:20,800 --> 00:42:23,600
Jing Lin, go and find Zhang Baohuan.

427
00:42:23,600 --> 00:42:25,068
Yes!

428
00:42:26,040 --> 00:42:35,000
