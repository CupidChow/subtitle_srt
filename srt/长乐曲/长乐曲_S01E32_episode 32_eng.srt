00:00:26,990 --> 00:00:32,080
 "Go Ahead Fearlessly" - Liu Yuning 

3
00:00:32,080 --> 00:00:35,024
â™«  Grudges and karma, right and wrong  â™«

4
00:00:35,024 --> 00:00:38,322
â™«  The past hides blood and tears  â™«

5
00:00:38,322 --> 00:00:40,691
â™«  It is hard to catch up after years of separation  â™«

6
00:00:40,691 --> 00:00:44,566
â™«  The truth cannot be fully revealed  â™«

7
00:00:44,566 --> 00:00:47,701
â™«  Fate is full of twists and turns  â™«

8
00:00:47,701 --> 00:00:50,866
â™«  Life and death, fortune and misfortune go hand in hand  â™«

9
00:00:50,866 --> 00:00:56,002
â™«  Obsession is hard to get rid of, keeping the truth 
 and getting rid of the lies, let the wind blow  â™«

10
00:00:56,002 --> 00:01:02,274
â™«  Tossed about by the wind and rain, I will never regret it, 
 I will accompany you for my whole life  â™«

11
00:01:02,274 --> 00:01:08,582
â™«  At least you share my joy and sorrow  â™«

12
00:01:08,582 --> 00:01:14,861
â™«  Unravelling fate, fearlessly, a dream returns  â™«

13
00:01:14,861 --> 00:01:21,274
â™«  The mountains and rivers are bright and beautiful, 
 holding hands, together we return  â™«

14
00:01:21,274 --> 00:01:29,018
â™«  In this life, my heart returns untainted of dust and ash  â™«

15
00:01:29,018 --> 00:01:37,252
   

16
00:01:37,252 --> 00:01:40,220
   

17
00:01:41,140 --> 00:01:44,540
I didn't mean to keep you and Madam Shen here today.

18
00:01:44,540 --> 00:01:47,140
Don't be so nervous.

19
00:01:49,340 --> 00:01:52,400
However, I do have some advice.

20
00:01:52,400 --> 00:01:58,230
The criminals arrested by the Imperial Inspectorate won't be freed so easily.

21
00:01:58,230 --> 00:02:02,520
You'd better think twice about what to note down,

22
00:02:02,520 --> 00:02:09,360
what to report, and what to keep to yourselves.

23
00:02:16,640 --> 00:02:21,680
Don't bring trouble to yourself and your family.

24
00:02:47,477 --> 00:02:52,259
   

25
00:03:03,700 --> 00:03:06,060
What exactly does Lai Luozhi want?

26
00:03:06,060 --> 00:03:08,160
You don't trust Sun Tan?

27
00:03:08,160 --> 00:03:10,360
Of course not.

28
00:03:10,360 --> 00:03:16,340
It's just that this truth that's about to be revealed is too terrifying to believe.

29
00:03:16,340 --> 00:03:20,560
But just as Lai Luozhi said, we only have speculations but no solid evidence.

30
00:03:20,560 --> 00:03:23,900
I'm afraid we won't be able to do anything to him.

31
00:03:23,900 --> 00:03:26,980
As for Sun Tan's testimony, what will you do about it?

32
00:03:26,980 --> 00:03:30,100
I will report it as it is.

33
00:03:30,100 --> 00:03:33,060
Sixth Miss, thank you!

34
00:03:47,060 --> 00:03:49,620
Registrar Lu, it's rare for you to come to the Imperial Inspectorate.

35
00:03:49,620 --> 00:03:52,780
You didn't even greet me before leaving?

36
00:03:54,740 --> 00:03:56,456
What's wrong?

37
00:03:58,660 --> 00:04:01,040
It seems like you're suddenly scared of me again.

38
00:04:01,780 --> 00:04:07,320
Have you recently arrested many officials?

39
00:04:07,320 --> 00:04:08,620
Yes.

40
00:04:08,620 --> 00:04:14,720
Isn't that why you and your nosy good friend are here in the Imperial Inspectorate?

41
00:04:14,720 --> 00:04:18,680
What do you want to do?

42
00:04:20,780 --> 00:04:23,620
Do you want to hurt Yan Xing?

43
00:04:24,940 --> 00:04:29,220
That's unfair. I thought you said I was your friend, too.

44
00:04:29,220 --> 00:04:31,270
Then why are you only worried about me hurting her,

45
00:04:31,270 --> 00:04:34,900
yet not worried if she might want to ruin my plan?

46
00:04:34,900 --> 00:04:37,420
I don't have a friend like you.

47
00:04:38,820 --> 00:04:42,300
Let me warn you. You must not hurt Yan Xing.

48
00:04:42,300 --> 00:04:46,880
If anything happens to Yan Xing, I will definitely not let you off the hook.

49
00:04:47,700 --> 00:04:52,640
It depends on what she wants to do.

50
00:05:03,020 --> 00:05:05,320
Don't you work for the Ministry of Justice?

51
00:05:06,040 --> 00:05:07,720
Why did you go to the Imperial Inspectorate?

52
00:05:07,720 --> 00:05:10,220
And you even went to find Madam Xu and submitted the dossier.

53
00:05:10,220 --> 00:05:13,380
You still have people from the Imperial Guards watching me?

54
00:05:19,480 --> 00:05:20,660
Do you know?

55
00:05:20,660 --> 00:05:25,080
The moment you stepped out of the Imperial Inspectorate today with Sun Tan's testimony,

56
00:05:25,960 --> 00:05:28,860
your head was no longer on your neck.

57
00:05:29,880 --> 00:05:33,880
But Sun Tan suspects Lai Luozhi is trying to take control of the Gannandao fortress,

58
00:05:33,880 --> 00:05:36,220
even conspiring with foreign tribes for ill intentions.

59
00:05:36,220 --> 00:05:39,880
Shouldn't such important information be reported to the Grand Empress Dowager?

60
00:05:39,880 --> 00:05:43,340
And I thought you wanted to help Sun Tan.

61
00:05:43,340 --> 00:05:47,180
Sun Tan has been very helpful to you and me in Gannandao.

62
00:05:47,180 --> 00:05:49,480
Of course. I'm going to help him.

63
00:05:52,100 --> 00:05:54,480
But I don't want you to be at risk.

64
00:06:04,420 --> 00:06:09,620
I know you. I'm not trying to stop you from investigating the case.

65
00:06:09,620 --> 00:06:14,600
But in the future, don't be so reckless.

66
00:06:17,760 --> 00:06:19,870
Next time something comes up,

67
00:06:19,870 --> 00:06:23,440
don't forget your husband is the Great Chief of the Imperial Guards.

68
00:06:38,460 --> 00:06:41,680
I was just afraid it would cause you trouble.

69
00:06:46,300 --> 00:06:51,240
If I were afraid of trouble, why would I marry you as my wife?

70
00:06:58,860 --> 00:07:03,960
Husband, after the Grand Empress Dowager reads Sun Tan's testimony,

71
00:07:03,960 --> 00:07:06,140
what will she do?

72
00:07:06,880 --> 00:07:08,880
I don't know.

73
00:07:10,180 --> 00:07:15,400
What I did today was what truly angered Lai Luozhi.

74
00:07:16,680 --> 00:07:21,700
I don't even know if I am helping Sun Tan,

75
00:07:21,700 --> 00:07:23,960
or harming him.

76
00:07:31,280 --> 00:07:35,500
Be true to your heart and do not worry about the future.

77
00:08:10,680 --> 00:08:14,180
Since you've told on me to Yan Xing and Xu Xiangren,

78
00:08:14,180 --> 00:08:19,260
I think you know what will happen to you.

79
00:08:19,260 --> 00:08:23,300
But you have a way to survive.

80
00:08:26,140 --> 00:08:29,620
Just write me a list of all the roving bandits

81
00:08:29,620 --> 00:08:32,900
that Xu Xiangren befriended before he became a marshal.

82
00:08:32,900 --> 00:08:36,620
I promise you can walk out of the Imperial Inspectorate alive

83
00:08:36,620 --> 00:08:42,020
and even take up the position of the next Marshal of Inspectors.

84
00:08:42,020 --> 00:08:45,240
You want me to frame Marshal Xu?

85
00:08:45,240 --> 00:08:49,700
This Xu Xiangren is really an eyesore.

86
00:08:56,720 --> 00:09:01,660
Do you know how Xu Xiangren became the Marshal of Inspectors?

87
00:09:05,260 --> 00:09:09,480
Back then, he made an agreement three times with the present Grand Empress Dowager

88
00:09:09,480 --> 00:09:12,600
to steal treasures from the imperial palace.

89
00:09:12,600 --> 00:09:18,060
And he managed to steal the treasures amidst thousands of guards.

90
00:09:18,800 --> 00:09:21,520
The Grand Empress Dowager admired his talent,

91
00:09:21,520 --> 00:09:25,380
so allowed him to take over Marshal Yuan's position.

92
00:09:27,700 --> 00:09:32,500
With your ability, how dare you frame him!

93
00:09:38,440 --> 00:09:42,240
What a tough man! You haven't seen the situation clearly.

94
00:09:42,240 --> 00:09:47,440
Just give me the list. The Imperial Inspectorate will handle the rest.

95
00:09:47,440 --> 00:09:49,880
It's a simple job for you,

96
00:09:49,880 --> 00:09:54,420
and it's not exactly betrayal, is it?

97
00:09:57,940 --> 00:10:04,320
Don't you want to be the Marshal of Inspectors who's commanding all inspectors?

98
00:10:30,040 --> 00:10:32,260
I do.

99
00:10:34,160 --> 00:10:36,400
Very much.

100
00:10:40,080 --> 00:10:46,560
I really want to take the token to command all inspectors.

101
00:10:48,900 --> 00:10:51,020
I'll wait for your list.

102
00:11:21,390 --> 00:11:24,140
 - What did you steal? 
 - None of your business. 

103
00:11:37,380 --> 00:11:39,000
 People of the Jianghu, even thieves have their own code. 

104
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:40,720
 You stole something, and did it in such a despicable way. 

105
00:11:40,720 --> 00:11:42,560
 - Today, I'llâ€” 
 - Don't hit Brother Tan! 

106
00:11:42,560 --> 00:11:45,820
 - Hurry up and leave! 
 - Don't hurt Brother Tan! We'll give you all our food. 

107
00:11:45,820 --> 00:11:46,860
 Just go! 

108
00:11:46,860 --> 00:11:49,080
 He stole things for you? 

109
00:11:49,080 --> 00:11:52,140
 Brother Tan is kind and nice. Without him, I would have starved to death. 

110
00:11:52,140 --> 00:11:54,440
 - You should go! 
 - Don't hit him! Don't hit him, he's a nice person! 

111
00:11:54,440 --> 00:11:56,960
 Right. He's a nice person. 

112
00:11:58,920 --> 00:12:00,760
 Don't hit him! 

113
00:12:00,760 --> 00:12:04,000
 Don't steal anymore. Come work for me. 

114
00:12:05,780 --> 00:12:07,750
 Stop putting on a show. 

115
00:12:08,520 --> 00:12:12,520
 You don't look rich. Maybe you haven't stolen as much as I have. 

116
00:12:12,520 --> 00:12:13,980
 Now I'm not skillful enough.. 

117
00:12:13,980 --> 00:12:17,700
 When I get better at it, I could steal anything from the palace. 

118
00:12:17,700 --> 00:12:19,820
 Very well. Just wait here. 

119
00:12:19,820 --> 00:12:24,360
 I'm going to steal a treasure from the palace to show you. 

120
00:12:32,780 --> 00:12:34,672
 Be gentle. 

121
00:12:38,380 --> 00:12:41,780
 Were these things you stole from the palace? 

122
00:12:41,780 --> 00:12:44,080
 I have already promised the Grand Empress Dowager. 

123
00:12:44,080 --> 00:12:48,660
 From now on, I am the one who commands all the inspectors, Marshal of Inspectors. 

124
00:12:48,660 --> 00:12:51,920
 From now on, if you're willing to follow me, then become inspectors. 

125
00:12:51,920 --> 00:12:54,100
 I don't want to become an inspector. 

126
00:12:54,100 --> 00:12:56,900
 What I want to become is the Marshal of Inspectors. 

127
00:12:56,900 --> 00:12:58,160
 - Right? 
 - Yes. 

128
00:12:58,160 --> 00:13:02,540
 You have ambition. Then you have to find a way to defeat me first. 

129
00:13:03,380 --> 00:13:05,056
 Come down. 

130
00:13:10,260 --> 00:13:14,860
 When I become stronger one day, I will kill you. 

131
00:13:22,580 --> 00:13:25,640
 Fine, I promise you. 

132
00:13:27,260 --> 00:13:29,140
 When I'm dead, 

133
00:13:29,140 --> 00:13:32,920
 this Marshal of Inspectors's token will be yours. 
   

134
00:13:32,920 --> 00:13:34,510
 All right! 

135
00:13:35,220 --> 00:13:36,990
 I promise you. 

136
00:13:36,990 --> 00:13:41,620
 I will work for you until the day you die. 

137
00:13:44,380 --> 00:13:48,780
 I'm not dead yet. I'm waiting for you to get this token. 

138
00:13:48,780 --> 00:13:53,520
â™«  Obsession is hard to get rid of, keeping the truth 
 and getting rid of the lies, let the wind blow  â™«

139
00:13:53,520 --> 00:13:56,160
But you're not dead yet.

140
00:13:58,120 --> 00:14:00,240
How can I take your token?

141
00:14:00,240 --> 00:14:06,462
â™«  At least you share my joy and sorrow  â™«

142
00:14:10,603 --> 00:14:12,790
   

143
00:14:12,790 --> 00:14:20,316
â™«  The mountains and rivers are bright and beautiful, 
 holding hands, together we return  â™«

144
00:14:35,728 --> 00:14:39,550
   

145
00:14:39,550 --> 00:14:43,750
   

146
00:14:58,520 --> 00:15:03,040
Sixth Miss, it's the document sent by the Imperial Inspectorate for you.

147
00:15:03,040 --> 00:15:05,220
   

148
00:15:05,220 --> 00:15:07,540
I thought Lai Luozhi would come looking to start trouble with you.

149
00:15:07,540 --> 00:15:09,200
Seeing you are fine today, I'm relieved now.

150
00:15:09,200 --> 00:15:11,396
   

151
00:15:19,120 --> 00:15:22,980
Sixth Miss, what does it say?

152
00:15:31,900 --> 00:15:36,400
Sun Tan took his own life out of fear of punishment!

153
00:15:46,260 --> 00:15:48,080
He's dead.

154
00:15:48,080 --> 00:15:51,880
Lai Luozhi! This bastard!

155
00:15:58,620 --> 00:16:00,660
Brother Xu!

156
00:16:01,640 --> 00:16:04,220
It was me who caused Sun Tan's death.

157
00:16:05,560 --> 00:16:07,360
Marshal Xu knew you would think this way.

158
00:16:07,360 --> 00:16:09,600
So once we got the news, we came over.

159
00:16:09,600 --> 00:16:15,140
What Sun Tan wanted to say has already been written in the memorial.

160
00:16:15,140 --> 00:16:17,510
He chose to commit suicide.

161
00:16:17,510 --> 00:16:21,460
One is to protect all the Jianghu comrades of Gannandao.

162
00:16:22,180 --> 00:16:24,092
Two...

163
00:16:27,660 --> 00:16:29,980
is to protect me.

164
00:16:38,700 --> 00:16:43,120
Brother, rest in peace.

165
00:17:18,519 --> 00:17:20,208
Sixth Miss!

166
00:17:22,260 --> 00:17:26,040
Why did you drink wine? Come on.

167
00:17:30,200 --> 00:17:31,916
Lift your foot.

168
00:17:45,200 --> 00:17:47,460
Is it because of Sun Tan?

169
00:17:53,780 --> 00:17:57,440
Sun Tan was a brave man.

170
00:17:57,440 --> 00:18:00,180
It was me who failed to protect him.

171
00:18:00,180 --> 00:18:03,180
Today, I wanted to plead for him to the Grand Empress Dowager.

172
00:18:04,300 --> 00:18:06,740
But it was still too late.

173
00:18:08,440 --> 00:18:11,100
Sun Tan died for no good reason.

174
00:18:14,760 --> 00:18:19,600
Take a look at this. A letter from Pan Chi. Pan Chi.

175
00:18:22,380 --> 00:18:24,960
At this time, why are you still jealous?

176
00:18:24,960 --> 00:18:28,060
It's important. It matters to the Shen family case.

177
00:18:28,060 --> 00:18:32,300
Thisâ€¦ Pan Chi mentioned the great fire at the granary and the combustion-aiding technique.

178
00:18:32,300 --> 00:18:35,260
It means that the great fire at the granary that led to the Shen family's conviction

179
00:18:35,260 --> 00:18:38,480
was deliberately triggered by someone using the combustion-aiding technique.

180
00:18:38,480 --> 00:18:41,400
But the pattern on this jade pendantâ€¦

181
00:18:44,020 --> 00:18:45,848
What's wrong?

182
00:18:47,080 --> 00:18:50,520
This pattern was on the jade pendant

183
00:18:50,520 --> 00:18:52,840
given by the late emperor to the Zhou family when he married the Grand Empress Dowager.

184
00:18:52,840 --> 00:18:54,900
The Zhou family?

185
00:18:54,900 --> 00:18:59,040
Does Pan Chi mean that fire

186
00:18:59,040 --> 00:19:01,340
was set by the Zhou family?

187
00:19:03,360 --> 00:19:07,600
 The one who killed the people of the Shen family was never anyone else, 

188
00:19:07,600 --> 00:19:11,360
 but her, Zhou Xu, the Zhou family. 

189
00:19:12,700 --> 00:19:16,080
The combustion-aiding technique is the secret technique of the Huo'e Sect.

190
00:19:16,080 --> 00:19:18,120
Why would it be related to the Zhou family?

191
00:19:18,120 --> 00:19:19,840
Sixth Miss.

192
00:19:23,760 --> 00:19:25,300
Would you like to go back and rest?

193
00:19:25,300 --> 00:19:29,540
No. I promised to find the truth with you.

194
00:19:29,540 --> 00:19:32,070
Now we have finally found a clue.

195
00:19:32,070 --> 00:19:34,580
But why would it be the Zhou family?

196
00:19:37,300 --> 00:19:40,220
Great Chief, a secret report from Gannandao.

197
00:19:40,220 --> 00:19:44,320
It's the autopsy results of those Half-faced Demons in Gannandao.

198
00:19:47,100 --> 00:19:49,680
Regarding those triangular-shaped needle marks, upon examination,

199
00:19:49,680 --> 00:19:53,260
it is the slow-acting poison, Ten-Day Poison.

200
00:19:55,880 --> 00:20:01,200
As the name implies, the people who get poisoned would die of poison ten days later.

201
00:20:01,200 --> 00:20:03,620
Sixth Miss! Sixth Miss!

202
00:20:04,820 --> 00:20:08,040
On the neck of the deceased, there were triangular-shaped needle marks.

203
00:20:08,040 --> 00:20:11,500
Yuanniang. So as Yuanniang.

204
00:20:11,500 --> 00:20:13,210
Shen Du, do you remember it?

205
00:20:13,210 --> 00:20:15,960
The day of the Imperial Preceptor's memorial, I got captured by you.

206
00:20:15,960 --> 00:20:18,660
I was on the mountain investigating Yuanniang's case.

207
00:20:18,660 --> 00:20:20,440
The case was closed as a crime of passion.

208
00:20:20,440 --> 00:20:23,120
But when I was sorting through the dossiers,

209
00:20:23,120 --> 00:20:26,700
I discovered that on Yuanniang's body, there were also triangular-shaped needle marks,

210
00:20:27,820 --> 00:20:32,140
indicating that Yuanniang most likely was also poisoned with the Ten-Day Poison.

211
00:20:32,880 --> 00:20:37,560
Why would the Huo'e Sect target her and even use a slow-acting poison on her?

212
00:20:37,560 --> 00:20:41,820
An ordinary farmer's wife was targeted

213
00:20:41,820 --> 00:20:44,760
and poisoned with a slow-acting poison.

214
00:20:44,760 --> 00:20:46,940
There's only one possibility.

215
00:20:46,940 --> 00:20:51,180
She learned things she shouldn't know and had to be silenced.

216
00:20:51,180 --> 00:20:56,920
Go check if she had any special identity or secrets.

217
00:20:56,920 --> 00:20:58,532
Yes.

218
00:21:04,780 --> 00:21:08,320
It seems that the granary back then was indeed empty.

219
00:21:08,320 --> 00:21:11,800
Using the Huo'e Sect's combustion-aiding technique to burn down the granary

220
00:21:11,800 --> 00:21:17,320
was to cover up the fact that the granary was empty.

221
00:21:17,320 --> 00:21:20,920
This matter is likely related to Lai Luozhi. And the Zhou familyâ€¦

222
00:21:20,920 --> 00:21:22,660
Sixth Miss.

223
00:21:23,560 --> 00:21:25,356
Thank you.

224
00:21:27,900 --> 00:21:29,440
Now it seems

225
00:21:29,440 --> 00:21:33,140
that the forces behind the injustice against the Shen family are deeply intertwined.

226
00:21:34,660 --> 00:21:37,220
We must not act in haste.

227
00:21:43,180 --> 00:21:46,680
Sixth Miss, no matter what,

228
00:21:48,060 --> 00:21:50,580
I don't want you to be at risk.

229
00:22:40,120 --> 00:22:41,960
Shen Du.

230
00:22:53,920 --> 00:22:56,320
What time is it now?

231
00:22:57,240 --> 00:23:01,080
Don't worry. Get some rest today.

232
00:23:11,800 --> 00:23:13,960
You got drunk last night.

233
00:23:23,760 --> 00:23:26,020
Pan Chi's letterâ€¦

234
00:23:27,680 --> 00:23:29,492
It's very useful.

235
00:23:30,680 --> 00:23:35,700
The secrets behind the Shen family case are about to be revealed.

236
00:23:37,120 --> 00:23:39,056
Thank you, Wife.

237
00:23:44,240 --> 00:23:46,760
Yuanniang, Ten-Day Poison.

238
00:23:46,760 --> 00:23:48,360
Jing Lin went to investigate.

239
00:23:48,360 --> 00:23:50,760
She's not just a farmer nearby,

240
00:23:50,760 --> 00:23:53,080
but also used to be responsible for cleaning Ming Hall.

241
00:23:53,080 --> 00:23:55,052
Ming Hall?

242
00:23:56,400 --> 00:23:59,540
During his lifetime, the Imperial Preceptor resided in Ming Hall.

243
00:23:59,540 --> 00:24:02,000
But since the Imperial Preceptor passed away,

244
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:06,000
all people related to Ming Hall have disappeared.

245
00:24:06,600 --> 00:24:09,820
Could all this be related to the Imperial Preceptor's death?

246
00:24:11,080 --> 00:24:13,360
Did the Imperial Preceptorâ€¦

247
00:24:14,960 --> 00:24:18,000
After the Imperial Preceptor divined the last prophecy,

248
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:20,060
he passed away shortly after.

249
00:24:20,920 --> 00:24:22,840
I have heard a rumor.

250
00:24:22,840 --> 00:24:24,770
The last prophecy of the Imperial Preceptor

251
00:24:24,770 --> 00:24:26,780
is that "The phoenix leads the nine fledglings, bringing peace to the realm."

252
00:24:26,780 --> 00:24:29,760
And there's a latter half unknown.

253
00:24:29,760 --> 00:24:36,300
In that case, the death of the Imperial Preceptor might also be quite suspicious.

254
00:24:37,440 --> 00:24:42,700
Could it be that... the death of the Imperial Preceptor and Yuanniang,

255
00:24:42,700 --> 00:24:44,570
and the disappearance of those related to Ming Hall,

256
00:24:44,570 --> 00:24:46,960
are all related to that prophecy?

257
00:24:55,880 --> 00:24:58,860
 Madam, someone from the palace came to deliver an imperial decree, 

258
00:24:58,860 --> 00:25:04,080
 saying the Grand Empress Dowager has summoned you to meet her alone in the palace. 

259
00:25:04,080 --> 00:25:06,120
I'll go with you.

260
00:25:07,960 --> 00:25:11,320
The Grand Empress Dowager asked me to go alone.

261
00:25:12,640 --> 00:25:14,520
All right, Uncle Zhong. I understand.

262
00:25:14,520 --> 00:25:16,140
Ask the messenger to wait a moment.

263
00:25:16,140 --> 00:25:17,400
I will change my clothes and go.

264
00:25:17,400 --> 00:25:19,184
 Yes. 

265
00:25:41,960 --> 00:25:44,000
Wait for me.

266
00:25:52,240 --> 00:25:53,720
Mind the propriety.

267
00:25:53,720 --> 00:25:56,260
Don't act recklessly.

268
00:25:56,260 --> 00:26:02,360
And don't bring up anything related to Sun Tan anymore.

269
00:26:03,440 --> 00:26:06,520
Don't mention anything related to Lai Luozhi...

270
00:26:08,560 --> 00:26:09,700
or the Shen family.

271
00:26:09,700 --> 00:26:13,720
All right, I understand.

272
00:26:17,180 --> 00:26:20,340
When did you become so long-winded?

273
00:26:36,840 --> 00:26:38,720
Madam Xu.

274
00:26:38,720 --> 00:26:41,340
This is not the way to the small study.

275
00:26:42,280 --> 00:26:44,600
We're not going to the small study today.

276
00:26:44,600 --> 00:26:48,000
The Grand Empress Dowager is waiting for you in the palace chamber.

277
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:50,680
The Grand Empress Dowager's palace chamber?

278
00:26:54,720 --> 00:26:56,852
Grand Empress Dowager.

279
00:26:58,240 --> 00:27:00,840
I humbly pay my respect, Your Majesty.

280
00:27:00,840 --> 00:27:03,060
Please rise.

281
00:27:08,400 --> 00:27:10,440
Jade cake?

282
00:27:10,440 --> 00:27:13,680
This is my favorite food.

283
00:27:13,680 --> 00:27:15,040
but now I canâ€™t handle it anymore.

284
00:27:15,040 --> 00:27:18,600
Even eating half a piece, I can't eat anything for half a day.

285
00:27:18,600 --> 00:27:21,480
Not like you young people anymore.

286
00:27:21,480 --> 00:27:23,180
Have a taste.

287
00:27:30,080 --> 00:27:32,400
This jade cake is incredibly rare,

288
00:27:32,400 --> 00:27:34,560
made from rouge rice tributed from the Western Region.

289
00:27:34,560 --> 00:27:38,140
Dry it and then ground it into powder, then combine it with lotus leaf powder.

290
00:27:38,140 --> 00:27:40,160
The filling is even more complex.

291
00:27:40,160 --> 00:27:43,140
Grand Empress Dowager does not easily reward people with this.

292
00:27:43,140 --> 00:27:47,440
Have a taste and see what's different from what's made outside the palace.

293
00:27:55,040 --> 00:27:56,440
It's salty?

294
00:27:56,440 --> 00:27:59,700
So whether it's this pastry or people,

295
00:27:59,700 --> 00:28:05,340
just by looking at the surface, you can't always tell or you might make mistakes.

296
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:08,740
Youâ€™re the clever one with a lot to say.

297
00:28:17,600 --> 00:28:19,572
Grand Empress Dowager.

298
00:28:21,080 --> 00:28:22,640
Grand Empress Dowager!

299
00:28:22,640 --> 00:28:26,120
In a couple of days, it will be the start of winter. You must not catch a cold.

300
00:28:26,120 --> 00:28:30,000
You all think that I am old.

301
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:32,720
Grand Empress Dowager is truly the lucky star of Great Cang.

302
00:28:32,720 --> 00:28:38,120
The people all wish for your long life, hoping Your Majesty will continue to protect Great Cang.

303
00:28:38,680 --> 00:28:40,840
Yan Xing,

304
00:28:40,840 --> 00:28:45,380
do you know why I summoned you this time?

305
00:28:46,200 --> 00:28:48,140
I don't know.

306
00:28:49,240 --> 00:28:52,000
There's something...

307
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:54,640
I want to know.

308
00:28:54,640 --> 00:28:56,160
Here is the first thing.

309
00:28:56,160 --> 00:29:01,960
I heard Mo Qianzhi, former Governor of Yingzhou, claimed before his death

310
00:29:01,960 --> 00:29:07,320
that the Shen family case was led by me.

311
00:29:08,860 --> 00:29:11,660
Shen Du is so loyal to you.

312
00:29:11,660 --> 00:29:13,660
So am I.

313
00:29:16,720 --> 00:29:18,120
Do not panic.

314
00:29:18,120 --> 00:29:20,280
Rise and tell us in detail.

315
00:29:25,520 --> 00:29:27,880
Mo Qianzhi did say so.

316
00:29:27,880 --> 00:29:30,940
But Shen Du has served you for many years,

317
00:29:30,940 --> 00:29:33,720
how could he be fooled by a few words?

318
00:29:33,720 --> 00:29:37,400
Moreover, that Mo Qianzhi was also fooled by villains,

319
00:29:37,400 --> 00:29:39,500
only then did he believe these words.

320
00:29:39,500 --> 00:29:42,620
Mo Qianzhi wanted to repay his master's kindness, and had an obsession in his heart,

321
00:29:42,620 --> 00:29:45,000
wanting to find out the truth about the Shen family case.

322
00:29:45,000 --> 00:29:47,500
Thus he was misled by someone

323
00:29:47,500 --> 00:29:49,440
becoming the executioner of the Huo'e Sect.

324
00:29:49,440 --> 00:29:51,800
Thus he made a grave mistake.

325
00:29:53,080 --> 00:29:54,920
Here is the second thing.

326
00:29:54,920 --> 00:29:57,720
The Huo'e Sect has lingered in Yingzhou for many years,

327
00:29:57,720 --> 00:30:00,960
and yet not a trace of rumor was leaked out.

328
00:30:00,960 --> 00:30:06,220
Then does this Huo'e Sect have power elsewhere?

329
00:30:06,220 --> 00:30:07,916
Wellâ€¦

330
00:30:10,480 --> 00:30:12,280
I'm afraid there still is.

331
00:30:12,280 --> 00:30:17,260
But how it presents itself openly is unknown.

332
00:30:17,800 --> 00:30:19,720
This Yingzhou case is an example.

333
00:30:19,720 --> 00:30:25,540
If one Mo Qianzhi falls, will there be more Mo Qianzhis to emerge?

334
00:30:28,640 --> 00:30:31,000
Grand Empress Dowager governs diligently and cares for the people.

335
00:30:31,000 --> 00:30:32,680
If the people live and work in peace,

336
00:30:32,680 --> 00:30:36,580
there definitely won't be more people like Mo Qianzhi emerging.

337
00:30:36,580 --> 00:30:42,960
Back then, I was in the imperial court assisting the young emperor, bearing so many curses.

338
00:30:42,960 --> 00:30:46,600
No one could really understand how helpless I was.

339
00:30:46,600 --> 00:30:49,880
Everyone wanted to live comfortably.

340
00:30:49,880 --> 00:30:53,680
But since one holds a position,

341
00:30:53,680 --> 00:30:57,820
one should shoulder the responsibilities that come with it.

342
00:30:57,820 --> 00:31:03,360
As the Grand Empress Dowager, I am well aware of the uncertain future.

343
00:31:03,360 --> 00:31:05,780
But I have never given up.

344
00:31:05,780 --> 00:31:10,800
Qi'er was little, as a woman in charge,

345
00:31:10,800 --> 00:31:14,040
how many men in the world would respect me?

346
00:31:14,040 --> 00:31:17,040
But I insist on making them respect me.

347
00:31:21,400 --> 00:31:24,120
These years have been relatively stable,

348
00:31:24,120 --> 00:31:26,960
living up to the late emperor's trust.

349
00:31:27,580 --> 00:31:32,580
The grace of the Grand Empress Dowager is a model for all women in Great Cang.

350
00:31:34,280 --> 00:31:36,520
One more thing.

351
00:31:43,600 --> 00:31:46,840
Regarding Sun Tan's death,

352
00:31:47,560 --> 00:31:50,400
I know that you

353
00:31:50,400 --> 00:31:54,440
submitted a petition to the palace despite pressure.

354
00:31:54,440 --> 00:31:58,120
But Sun Tan still died for no reason.

355
00:31:58,120 --> 00:32:05,700
Do you think that it was me who let Lai Luozhi do whatever he wanted?

356
00:32:07,620 --> 00:32:11,880
Grand Empress Dowager needs Vice Minister Lai to inspect the officials.

357
00:32:11,880 --> 00:32:14,280
Naturally it requires power.

358
00:32:14,280 --> 00:32:17,880
But I know everyone will make mistakes.

359
00:32:17,880 --> 00:32:21,220
If there's something suspicious in the case,

360
00:32:21,220 --> 00:32:25,120
I am willing to be a candid advisor, offering straightforward advice and corrections.

361
00:32:28,600 --> 00:32:30,360
Good.

362
00:32:30,360 --> 00:32:33,480
What a candid advisor you are!

363
00:32:33,480 --> 00:32:36,720
Yan Xing, you are frank and straightforward.

364
00:32:36,720 --> 00:32:38,920
I like you.

365
00:32:41,920 --> 00:32:47,120
Do you know Lai Luozhi paid his respects to me last night?

366
00:32:47,120 --> 00:32:50,000
He mentioned many of your accomplishments.

367
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:54,140
And he even told me to value you.

368
00:32:55,380 --> 00:32:56,880
I'm flattered.

369
00:32:56,880 --> 00:32:58,920
I have no dealings with Minister Lai.

370
00:32:58,920 --> 00:33:02,480
I don't know why Minister Lai complimented me.

371
00:33:02,480 --> 00:33:06,060
Iâ€¦ do not desire any reward.

372
00:33:06,060 --> 00:33:10,980
I only wish to resolve the case and find out the truth, to bring justice to the deceased.

373
00:33:11,840 --> 00:33:13,720
All right, rise!

374
00:33:13,720 --> 00:33:16,080
How many times have you knelt just now?

375
00:33:16,080 --> 00:33:17,908
Get up quickly!

376
00:33:27,160 --> 00:33:30,000
Come, come here.

377
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:31,828
Take this.

378
00:33:38,200 --> 00:33:42,760
Looking at you reminds me of when I was young.

379
00:33:42,760 --> 00:33:44,200
If you are available,

380
00:33:44,200 --> 00:33:48,560
come to the palace more often to chat with me. All right?

381
00:33:51,860 --> 00:33:54,280
Thank you, Grand Empress Dowager!

382
00:34:02,890 --> 00:34:06,490
   

383
00:34:09,900 --> 00:34:12,299
Have you ever heard of Consort Shu?

384
00:34:13,820 --> 00:34:18,020
The concubine who was with the late emperor from Nanlang?

385
00:34:18,719 --> 00:34:19,920
I've heard a little.

386
00:34:19,920 --> 00:34:23,580
This was once the mansion given to Consort Shu by the later emperor.

387
00:34:26,199 --> 00:34:29,760
Rumor has it Consort Shu competed for favor,

388
00:34:29,760 --> 00:34:33,839
was killed by the then-empress, who is now the Grand Empress Dowager.

389
00:34:36,080 --> 00:34:38,960
Actually, Consort Shu passed away in sorrow

390
00:34:38,960 --> 00:34:40,920
due to longing for her homeland.

391
00:34:40,920 --> 00:34:45,940
In this palace, this is another sad story.

392
00:35:11,720 --> 00:35:14,880
Now you have the palace token to enter and exit the inner palace at will.

393
00:35:14,880 --> 00:35:16,720
You should understand

394
00:35:16,720 --> 00:35:20,920
power comes with great responsibility.

395
00:35:22,520 --> 00:35:24,240
I feel confused.

396
00:35:24,240 --> 00:35:26,760
Please advise me, Madam Xu.

397
00:35:28,400 --> 00:35:31,080
A few days ago, I delivered for you the testimony of Sun Tan,

398
00:35:31,080 --> 00:35:33,380
and the Grand Empress Dowager gave no comments.

399
00:35:33,380 --> 00:35:35,960
Lai Luozhi deliberately complimented you in front of the Grand Empress Dowager.

400
00:35:35,960 --> 00:35:38,740
Today, the Grand Empress Dowager specifically invited you here,

401
00:35:38,740 --> 00:35:41,020
to give you the chance to explain.

402
00:35:42,100 --> 00:35:43,340
You should understand

403
00:35:43,340 --> 00:35:46,520
that in this world where men are honored above women,

404
00:35:46,520 --> 00:35:48,600
the Grand Empress Dowager must consider public opinion,

405
00:35:48,600 --> 00:35:52,040
also ensure the loyalty of her officials.

406
00:35:52,040 --> 00:35:56,200
I thought that things in the world were either black or white.

407
00:35:56,200 --> 00:36:00,820
But after experiencing so much, I have come to understand a little.

408
00:36:02,120 --> 00:36:04,520
The Grand Empress Dowager intentionally shows you favor.

409
00:36:04,520 --> 00:36:06,440
Firstly, because she truly values you.

410
00:36:06,440 --> 00:36:09,520
And secondly, of course, for Shen Du.

411
00:36:09,520 --> 00:36:13,120
And you were recommended by Prime Minister Zhang to marry into the Shen family.

412
00:36:13,120 --> 00:36:16,160
Now Lai Luozhi admires you.

413
00:36:16,160 --> 00:36:18,280
It's hard not to wonder

414
00:36:18,280 --> 00:36:22,520
if you're an informant between black and white.

415
00:36:26,520 --> 00:36:30,670
   

416
00:36:56,800 --> 00:36:58,780
I'm Yan Xing, Chief Director of the Ministry of Justice.

417
00:36:58,780 --> 00:37:00,620
Greetings to Minister Lai.

418
00:37:03,640 --> 00:37:05,960
You've spent much time with Shen Du,

419
00:37:05,960 --> 00:37:10,760
I do not know about the others, but you've become quite reckless.

420
00:37:10,760 --> 00:37:13,520
I am confused.

421
00:37:13,520 --> 00:37:17,000
Even the case that the Judicial Government Office avoids,

422
00:37:17,000 --> 00:37:19,960
yet you dare to take on the presiding judge.

423
00:37:19,960 --> 00:37:24,220
I guess it's because you have the Imperial Guards backing you.

424
00:37:24,720 --> 00:37:29,380
And even those roving bandits want to help you.

425
00:37:29,380 --> 00:37:35,040
But no matter what you did, the Sun Tan case has no effect on me.

426
00:37:35,040 --> 00:37:38,500
You should understand the situation clearly.

427
00:37:39,920 --> 00:37:42,440
Thank you for the reminder, Minister Lai.

428
00:37:42,440 --> 00:37:45,920
I have no great talent or ambitions.

429
00:37:45,920 --> 00:37:49,920
I naturally do things without sufficient consideration.

430
00:37:50,580 --> 00:37:52,680
Well,

431
00:37:52,680 --> 00:37:57,080
I truly admire your sister for being talented in both literature and martial arts,

432
00:37:57,080 --> 00:37:59,160
unmatched in the world.

433
00:38:00,620 --> 00:38:02,240
Right.

434
00:38:02,240 --> 00:38:06,000
That day, when my husband and I were strolling on the streets of Yingzhou,

435
00:38:06,000 --> 00:38:10,320
my husband said he saw your sister.

436
00:38:14,400 --> 00:38:17,280
Madam Shen, what are you talking about?

437
00:38:17,280 --> 00:38:21,200
It's been cold recently, my sister has been resting at home all along.

438
00:38:21,200 --> 00:38:24,960
A few days ago, she went out together with several officials' family members.

439
00:38:24,960 --> 00:38:27,300
Why would she have gone to Yingzhou?

440
00:38:28,680 --> 00:38:30,620
Mrs. Shen, if you want to frame someone,

441
00:38:30,620 --> 00:38:33,000
you have to get solid evidence.

442
00:38:33,840 --> 00:38:35,700
If Shen Du can't teach you well,

443
00:38:35,700 --> 00:38:37,840
maybe come to my Imperial Inspectorate,

444
00:38:37,840 --> 00:38:40,240
I will certainly...

445
00:38:41,480 --> 00:38:44,320
teach you properly.

446
00:38:44,320 --> 00:38:46,056
Is that so?

447
00:38:47,700 --> 00:38:50,280
Well, I wish your sister good health.

448
00:38:50,280 --> 00:38:52,320
I take my leave.

449
00:38:54,340 --> 00:38:55,970
Right.

450
00:38:56,520 --> 00:39:01,120
Prince Xian invites officials to the Winter Solstice feast.

451
00:39:01,120 --> 00:39:04,740
Surely, the Shen Mansion has also received the invitation. Right?

452
00:39:06,840 --> 00:39:08,700
Madam Shen,

453
00:39:08,700 --> 00:39:12,320
we shall meet again at the Prince Xian's mansion then.

454
00:39:19,077 --> 00:39:21,650
   

455
00:39:33,440 --> 00:39:35,348
Shen Du.

456
00:39:55,560 --> 00:39:57,000
Someone in the palace sent me a message,

457
00:39:57,000 --> 00:39:58,660
saying that Lai Luozhi intercepted you on the way.

458
00:39:58,660 --> 00:40:00,600
So I rushed over immediately.

459
00:40:00,600 --> 00:40:02,840
Did he do anything to you?

460
00:40:14,100 --> 00:40:16,320
Your ears are all red from the cold.

461
00:40:21,040 --> 00:40:23,280
You usually complain that the carriage is slow,

462
00:40:23,280 --> 00:40:25,200
so why did you take the carriage today?

463
00:40:25,200 --> 00:40:28,400
It's cold, and riding a horse is cold.

464
00:40:29,120 --> 00:40:33,200
I never knew that you were so considerate.

465
00:40:34,900 --> 00:40:37,320
How was your audience with Her Majesty today?

466
00:40:39,600 --> 00:40:41,690
   

467
00:40:48,200 --> 00:40:51,120
It's the Grand Empress Dowager's private palace token.

468
00:40:51,120 --> 00:40:53,520
Madam Xu reminded me of something.

469
00:40:53,520 --> 00:40:57,260
Power comes with great responsibility.

470
00:40:58,740 --> 00:41:00,560
If I'm correct,

471
00:41:00,560 --> 00:41:02,320
while the Grand Empress Dowager asked the Imperial Guards

472
00:41:02,320 --> 00:41:05,560
to monitor the Imperial Inspectorate
and Lai Luozhi,

473
00:41:05,560 --> 00:41:09,440
Lai Luozhi has also received a secret decree to monitor the Imperial Guards.

474
00:41:10,120 --> 00:41:11,780
No wonder today

475
00:41:11,780 --> 00:41:15,040
Lai Luozhi especially
waited for me at the palace gate,

476
00:41:15,040 --> 00:41:17,840
and even deliberately complimented me in front of the Grand Empress Dowager.

477
00:41:17,840 --> 00:41:20,020
I'm sure he guessed it too.

478
