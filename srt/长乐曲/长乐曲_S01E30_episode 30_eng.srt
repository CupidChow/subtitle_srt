00:00:27,050 --> 00:00:31,980
 "Go Ahead Fearlessly" - Liu Yuning 

3
00:00:31,980 --> 00:00:35,025
â™«  Grudges and karma, right and wrong  â™«

4
00:00:35,025 --> 00:00:38,223
â™«  The past hides blood and tears  â™«

5
00:00:38,223 --> 00:00:40,692
â™«  It is hard to catch up after years of separation  â™«

6
00:00:40,692 --> 00:00:44,567
â™«  The truth cannot be fully revealed  â™«

7
00:00:44,567 --> 00:00:47,602
â™«  Fate is full of twists and turns  â™«

8
00:00:47,602 --> 00:00:50,867
â™«  Life and death, fortune and misfortune go hand in hand  â™«

9
00:00:50,867 --> 00:00:55,903
â™«  Obsession is hard to get rid of, keeping the truth 
 and getting rid of the lies, let the wind blow  â™«

10
00:00:55,903 --> 00:01:02,275
â™«  Tossed about by the wind and rain, I will never regret it, 
 I will accompany you for my whole life  â™«

11
00:01:02,275 --> 00:01:08,583
â™«  At least you share my joy and sorrow  â™«

12
00:01:08,583 --> 00:01:14,862
â™«  Unravelling fate, fearlessly, a dream returns  â™«

13
00:01:14,862 --> 00:01:21,175
â™«  The mountains and rivers are bright and beautiful, 
 holding hands, together we return  â™«

14
00:01:21,175 --> 00:01:29,019
â™«  In this life, my heart returns untainted of dust and ash  â™«

15
00:01:29,019 --> 00:01:37,153
   

16
00:01:37,153 --> 00:01:40,288
   

17
00:01:40,288 --> 00:01:41,380
   

18
00:01:41,380 --> 00:01:45,160
Itâ€™s my fault for failing to capture Shen Du in Yingzhou.

19
00:01:45,160 --> 00:01:49,420
Is the Huo'e Sect in Yingzhou all gone?

20
00:01:49,420 --> 00:01:51,512
Yes.

21
00:02:05,900 --> 00:02:07,820
Trash...

22
00:02:09,056 --> 00:02:11,360
is useless!

23
00:02:27,840 --> 00:02:32,170
You got seriously injured. It seems you have to take a break for a while.

24
00:02:32,980 --> 00:02:36,840
Have you dealt with those Half-faced Demons in Yingzhou?

25
00:02:36,840 --> 00:02:40,120
I've already planted poison in advance. No one survived.

26
00:02:40,120 --> 00:02:45,490
Very well. What about the thing that Mo Qianzhi left for Shen Du?

27
00:02:46,200 --> 00:02:48,140
This is what Shen Du was looking for.

28
00:02:48,140 --> 00:02:52,100
Mo Qianzhi had been watching Yingzhou for so long,

29
00:02:52,100 --> 00:02:56,220
and must have known many of the officials' secrets in the imperial court.

30
00:03:08,020 --> 00:03:10,176
Poetry collection?

31
00:03:11,420 --> 00:03:13,300
How could that be?

32
00:03:13,300 --> 00:03:15,660
Shen Du must have switched it around that time.

33
00:03:15,660 --> 00:03:17,220
You got fooled by Shen Du.

34
00:03:17,220 --> 00:03:18,872
Iâ€¦

35
00:03:26,260 --> 00:03:28,380
Shen Du.

36
00:03:28,380 --> 00:03:34,480
Iâ€™d like to see how you plan to turn the tide next.

37
00:04:08,900 --> 00:04:13,660
I hadn't expected Prime Minister Zhang's faction to have been using Gannandao

38
00:04:13,660 --> 00:04:16,400
to smuggle with Xichen to reap huge profits for years.

39
00:04:16,400 --> 00:04:21,200
And the Princess of Valor has even been buying the frontier soldiers off in the name of funding.

40
00:04:21,200 --> 00:04:24,700
Senior Brother had quietly gained secrets over the two factions in the court,

41
00:04:25,540 --> 00:04:27,510
yet never reported it.

42
00:04:27,510 --> 00:04:29,600
He didn't trust the imperial court.

43
00:04:29,600 --> 00:04:34,280
Chen Huo'e must know about it, so she wanted to use me to find this.

44
00:04:34,280 --> 00:04:36,520
So what are you going to do about this?

45
00:04:36,520 --> 00:04:38,980
- I thinkâ€¦ 
 - Great Chief.

46
00:04:38,980 --> 00:04:40,980
Great Chief, something's wrong!

47
00:04:42,320 --> 00:04:44,080
Why the panic?

48
00:04:44,080 --> 00:04:48,320
Before we could interrogate the Half-faced Demons captured, they all died.

49
00:04:52,340 --> 00:04:55,880
Great Chief, these people must have died from poisoning.

50
00:04:55,880 --> 00:04:58,180
When they were captured, I'd searched them carefully,

51
00:04:58,180 --> 00:05:00,280
even checked every single tooth in their mouths.

52
00:05:00,280 --> 00:05:03,200
There's no way they could have taken poison.

53
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:21,140
This needle markâ€¦

54
00:05:22,160 --> 00:05:23,440
How could this be...?

55
00:05:23,440 --> 00:05:25,480
Did you notice anything?

56
00:05:28,240 --> 00:05:29,980
Jing Lin is right.

57
00:05:29,980 --> 00:05:31,750
Before these people were captured,

58
00:05:31,750 --> 00:05:33,580
they must have been poisoned with some slow-acting poison.

59
00:05:33,580 --> 00:05:35,440
Coroner, can you identify what kind of poison it was?

60
00:05:35,440 --> 00:05:37,720
Yes, but it will take some time.

61
00:05:37,720 --> 00:05:39,360
Report to me as soon as you find out.

62
00:05:39,360 --> 00:05:41,540
Yes, Great Chief.

63
00:05:43,200 --> 00:05:45,600
It's time to go back to Xiang'an.

64
00:06:13,740 --> 00:06:15,740
What are you reading?

65
00:06:16,720 --> 00:06:21,000
Along the way, we've passed through many places.

66
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:26,300
These are some records of my casual chats with local people.

67
00:06:26,300 --> 00:06:28,360
Have you found something different?

68
00:06:28,360 --> 00:06:32,720
From the memories of these people, I indeed found something suspicious.

69
00:06:32,720 --> 00:06:37,120
The year before the Shen Mansion case, Great Cang experienced a flood.

70
00:06:37,120 --> 00:06:41,360
Many people suffered greatly and lived in extreme hardship due to the lack of food.

71
00:06:41,360 --> 00:06:44,980
But here in Gannandao, in the memories of the people,

72
00:06:44,980 --> 00:06:47,820
there were also some areas affected by the flood.

73
00:06:47,820 --> 00:06:50,800
Logically speaking, there should have been a shortage of surplus grain.

74
00:06:50,800 --> 00:06:54,540
But the local grain prices had fallen rather than risen.

75
00:06:54,540 --> 00:06:58,640
Where did all this grain come from?

76
00:06:59,980 --> 00:07:02,140
Do you meanâ€¦?

77
00:07:02,140 --> 00:07:04,740
There's one possibility.

78
00:07:04,740 --> 00:07:09,380
Someone secretly took the official grain from the granary.

79
00:07:29,680 --> 00:07:31,548
Assassin!

80
00:08:41,600 --> 00:08:43,320
Sixth Miss!

81
00:08:51,440 --> 00:08:53,144
Let's go.

82
00:08:57,200 --> 00:09:00,160
Don't fight them. Let's enter the palace.

83
00:09:29,680 --> 00:09:32,260
Indeed, Minister Shen cares for the country as if it were his own family.

84
00:09:32,260 --> 00:09:34,880
You have just entered the Imperial City and come straight to the palace to report.

85
00:09:34,880 --> 00:09:38,480
No wonder Mother Empress thinks so highly of you.

86
00:09:39,500 --> 00:09:41,120
Your Highness, I'm flattered.

87
00:09:41,120 --> 00:09:45,000
I'm just trying my best to live up to the Grand Empress Dowager's trust.

88
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:49,280
It's best if you really think in this way.

89
00:09:50,220 --> 00:09:52,970
Itâ€™s not in vain that Mother Empress has given you much thought.

90
00:09:52,970 --> 00:09:55,660
Hoping you'll rise to great heights.

91
00:09:56,620 --> 00:09:58,920
What do you mean, Your Highness?

92
00:10:02,060 --> 00:10:06,300
Forget it. It is late at night.

93
00:10:08,880 --> 00:10:11,440
Jia'an, you must be tired too.

94
00:10:14,620 --> 00:10:19,140
Shen Du, let's catch up at my mansion later.

95
00:10:33,060 --> 00:10:35,960
Grand Empress Dowager, please have some tea.

96
00:10:41,220 --> 00:10:44,380
Grand Empress Dowager, they have arrived.

97
00:10:47,320 --> 00:10:50,000
May you be well, Grand Empress Dowager.

98
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:52,480
May you be blessed, Grand Empress Dowager.

99
00:10:52,480 --> 00:10:54,544
Rise.

100
00:10:58,400 --> 00:10:59,840
Minister Shen.

101
00:10:59,840 --> 00:11:04,960
I've read the memorial you asked someone to send.

102
00:11:04,960 --> 00:11:07,240
Mo Qianzhi is already dead.

103
00:11:07,240 --> 00:11:09,400
The rebels have been suppressed.

104
00:11:09,400 --> 00:11:13,120
And the Half-faced Demons have also been annihilated.

105
00:11:13,120 --> 00:11:15,960
You did a good job in Yingzhou.

106
00:11:15,960 --> 00:11:20,840
During the process, did you encounter any difficulties?

107
00:11:21,640 --> 00:11:25,460
Thanks to your blessing, everything went smoothly.

108
00:11:27,840 --> 00:11:31,680
What should I reward you?

109
00:11:31,680 --> 00:11:34,400
Shen Du is already the Great Chief,

110
00:11:34,400 --> 00:11:36,280
leading officials of all levels,

111
00:11:36,280 --> 00:11:38,160
and already a first-rank senior official.

112
00:11:38,160 --> 00:11:42,260
Then I wonder if he can't be promoted anymore.

113
00:11:45,560 --> 00:11:47,680
You!

114
00:11:48,880 --> 00:11:50,580
I've spoiled you so much.

115
00:11:50,580 --> 00:11:51,940
And you're speaking recklessly.

116
00:11:51,940 --> 00:11:55,200
Fortunately, Minister Shen is not an outsider.

117
00:11:55,200 --> 00:11:57,720
Otherwise, it would make others think

118
00:11:57,720 --> 00:12:01,800
that I want to warn Minister Shen via you.

119
00:12:01,800 --> 00:12:04,520
Grand Empress Dowager, please forgive me! I'm really sorry!

120
00:12:04,520 --> 00:12:08,000
Minister Shen, what do you think?

121
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:10,120
What reward do you desire?

122
00:12:10,120 --> 00:12:14,480
Just tell me, and I shall grant it.

123
00:12:19,440 --> 00:12:21,360
This is my job.

124
00:12:21,360 --> 00:12:23,480
I don't need any reward.

125
00:12:23,480 --> 00:12:26,220
This trip to Yingzhou, if my wife didn't go with me,

126
00:12:26,240 --> 00:12:28,280
I'm afraid it wouldn't have been so smooth.

127
00:12:28,280 --> 00:12:30,400
If there's a reward,

128
00:12:30,400 --> 00:12:33,200
then please reward Chief Clerk Yan Xing.

129
00:12:36,880 --> 00:12:41,500
It turns out you want to get a reward for your wife.

130
00:12:41,500 --> 00:12:46,560
It seems that this trip to Yingzhou has brought you two closer together.

131
00:12:46,560 --> 00:12:50,120
I did a good thing.

132
00:12:51,880 --> 00:12:53,440
Grand Empress Dowager, you are really wise.

133
00:12:53,440 --> 00:12:55,620
Rise.

134
00:12:56,320 --> 00:12:59,920
Minister Shen, you are a pillar of the state,

135
00:12:59,920 --> 00:13:02,740
meritorious but not seeking rewards.

136
00:13:02,740 --> 00:13:03,800
Good.

137
00:13:03,800 --> 00:13:08,900
I'll grant the reward to your wife as you requested.

138
00:13:08,900 --> 00:13:13,200
Beloved OfficialYan, you were instrumental in putting down the rebellion in Yingzhou.

139
00:13:13,200 --> 00:13:17,800
I'll promote you as the Chief Director under the jurisdiction of the Ministry of Justice,

140
00:13:17,800 --> 00:13:20,240
of the sixth rank.

141
00:13:21,420 --> 00:13:24,480
Thank you, Grand Empress Dowager!

142
00:13:24,480 --> 00:13:26,040
Beloved Official Yan.

143
00:13:26,040 --> 00:13:31,700
Is there any special reward you want?

144
00:13:31,700 --> 00:13:33,640
Responding to Grand Empress Dowager.

145
00:13:33,640 --> 00:13:36,960
I desire no other reward.

146
00:13:36,960 --> 00:13:38,560
Think it over again.

147
00:13:38,560 --> 00:13:40,760
It's a rare opportunity.

148
00:13:40,760 --> 00:13:43,320
Every word I say is true.

149
00:13:43,320 --> 00:13:45,080
I don't desire rewards.

150
00:13:45,080 --> 00:13:48,840
I only wish the world to be peaceful.

151
00:13:50,900 --> 00:13:53,720
Very well, Official Yan.

152
00:13:53,720 --> 00:13:57,360
As a woman, you care about the world.

153
00:13:57,360 --> 00:14:03,000
Great Cang really needs officials like you.

154
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:08,860
I heard you were attacked in Yingzhou, and almost killed.

155
00:14:08,860 --> 00:14:11,820
Send the imperial physician to their mansion.

156
00:14:11,820 --> 00:14:13,088
Yes.

157
00:14:13,088 --> 00:14:15,794
   

158
00:14:27,260 --> 00:14:29,160
What's wrong?

159
00:14:29,160 --> 00:14:32,980
You just got a promotion, why are you so upset?

160
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:37,480
Director Yan.

161
00:14:38,380 --> 00:14:40,240
I just figured it out.

162
00:14:40,240 --> 00:14:42,640
The trip to Yingzhou was a big deal.

163
00:14:42,640 --> 00:14:44,560
It would be inappropriate for the Grand Empress Dowager not to grant a reward,

164
00:14:44,560 --> 00:14:46,360
but Her Majesty doesn't want to reward you either.

165
00:14:46,360 --> 00:14:49,680
That Zhang Baohuan must have understood the Grand Empress Dowager's thoughts.

166
00:14:49,680 --> 00:14:51,640
So he put on a show with Madam Xu,

167
00:14:51,640 --> 00:14:53,240
saying you can't be promoted anymore.

168
00:14:53,240 --> 00:14:55,040
They just didn't want you to take credit.

169
00:14:55,040 --> 00:14:57,820
If you hadn't been so shrewd and perfect and had let this matter pass,

170
00:14:57,820 --> 00:15:00,240
I really don't know what would have happened.

171
00:15:00,240 --> 00:15:03,400
How are you going to deal with the booklet that Master Mo left for you?

172
00:15:03,400 --> 00:15:06,360
That booklet is so important.

173
00:15:06,360 --> 00:15:09,000
I'll present it later.

174
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:11,400
Even the fox can't outsmart you.

175
00:15:11,400 --> 00:15:13,720
You went to the palace at night to meet the Grand Empress Dowager,

176
00:15:13,720 --> 00:15:15,240
yet you didn't mention the booklet.

177
00:15:15,240 --> 00:15:19,200
It's just a fake move to scare some people.

178
00:15:19,200 --> 00:15:22,800
I'm afraid none of them will sleep well tonight.

179
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:29,240
You know me so well.

180
00:15:29,240 --> 00:15:33,560
So, I received a reward for doing nothing.

181
00:15:35,360 --> 00:15:38,100
The Princess of Valor said you are loyal to your duty.

182
00:15:38,100 --> 00:15:40,040
But you don't have to be loyal to your duty all night

183
00:15:40,040 --> 00:15:42,080
and not go home. Right?

184
00:15:44,080 --> 00:15:48,920
There's a place I need to show you.

185
00:16:17,520 --> 00:16:19,148
Let's go.

186
00:16:59,068 --> 00:17:02,583
   

187
00:17:32,720 --> 00:17:35,120
This isâ€¦

188
00:17:35,120 --> 00:17:38,120
This is what I want to tell you.

189
00:17:43,500 --> 00:17:45,720
When the Shen family encountered disaster,

190
00:17:46,920 --> 00:17:49,280
my mother was seriously ill,

191
00:17:49,280 --> 00:17:52,000
knowing that she would die soon,

192
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:54,000
so she had me write a confession.

193
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:56,460
 I don't know how, nor can I write it. 

194
00:17:56,460 --> 00:17:59,860
 Father would rather die to prove his innocence. 

195
00:17:59,860 --> 00:18:02,860
 I would rather, like my father, die to prove my integrity. 

196
00:18:02,860 --> 00:18:05,600
 But if even you die, 

197
00:18:05,600 --> 00:18:09,180
 then this unjust case will truly end. 

198
00:18:09,180 --> 00:18:13,600
 There are so many people in the Shen family who died in vain. 

199
00:18:13,600 --> 00:18:16,000
 And your father. 

200
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:17,720
 Their grievances, 

201
00:18:17,720 --> 00:18:19,960
 the truth they have always wanted, 

202
00:18:19,960 --> 00:18:23,160
 would truly remain unknown. 

203
00:18:23,160 --> 00:18:26,420
She told me to become an official,

204
00:18:26,420 --> 00:18:30,960
only then will there be a chance to clear the Shen family's name.

205
00:18:32,020 --> 00:18:34,240
From that day on,

206
00:18:34,240 --> 00:18:36,444
I have nothing...

207
00:18:38,280 --> 00:18:41,160
to live for but resentment.

208
00:18:50,600 --> 00:18:54,680
I carry too much resentment from the Shen family.

209
00:18:57,440 --> 00:19:00,040
Seeking the truth...

210
00:19:01,700 --> 00:19:04,840
became my only reason to live on.

211
00:19:15,600 --> 00:19:18,840
Perhaps people have already forgotten,

212
00:19:18,840 --> 00:19:21,480
or rather, no one cares.

213
00:19:22,160 --> 00:19:25,280
But I remember it vividly.

214
00:19:25,280 --> 00:19:28,080
I dare not forget for a moment...

215
00:19:30,720 --> 00:19:34,660
those innocent people who died for the Shen family.

216
00:19:37,200 --> 00:19:39,440
It's not just you,

217
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:43,200
but also me.

218
00:19:43,200 --> 00:19:45,200
I remember it.

219
00:19:50,720 --> 00:19:52,740
I've never forgotten Uncle Shen.

220
00:19:52,740 --> 00:19:54,400
   

221
00:19:54,400 --> 00:19:56,520
When something happened to the Shen Mansion,

222
00:19:56,520 --> 00:20:01,300
people said Uncle Shen betrayed the country and colluded with the enemy.

223
00:20:02,040 --> 00:20:03,916
I didn't believe it.

224
00:20:06,960 --> 00:20:10,380
He is the most honest and selfless person I have ever met.

225
00:20:10,380 --> 00:20:14,940
He would never do anything that would hurt the country and the people.

226
00:20:14,940 --> 00:20:17,400
So from that moment on, I resolved...

227
00:20:18,880 --> 00:20:24,660
to become a female official of the Ministry of Justice,

228
00:20:24,660 --> 00:20:30,060
hoping one day to find out the truth for myself.

229
00:20:44,780 --> 00:20:47,440
People call me the White Ghost,

230
00:20:49,220 --> 00:20:53,440
so I have come to accept that I am just a wandering soul, a lonely ghost,

231
00:20:55,160 --> 00:20:58,400
walking alone in this mortal purgatory.

232
00:21:03,560 --> 00:21:05,720
I really didn't expect...

233
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:13,080
that anyone would be as foolish as me.

234
00:21:43,720 --> 00:21:46,240
You are so warm...

235
00:21:47,920 --> 00:21:50,460
and alive,

236
00:21:50,460 --> 00:21:53,520
how would you be a lonely ghost?

237
00:21:58,040 --> 00:21:59,920
This heart...

238
00:22:01,230 --> 00:22:05,080
is alive with the expectations of so many.

239
00:22:08,240 --> 00:22:13,280
â™«  Never mind the destined solitary fate  â™«

240
00:22:13,280 --> 00:22:15,620
From now on,

241
00:22:17,140 --> 00:22:19,610
you won't be alone anymore.

242
00:22:23,780 --> 00:22:27,960
I will definitely try to help you find out the truth

243
00:22:27,960 --> 00:22:30,520
and clear the Shen family's name.

244
00:22:32,730 --> 00:22:38,343
â™«  He said he loves her  â™«

245
00:22:38,343 --> 00:22:42,885
â™«  The flower in the mirror, the moon in the water, present in my dreams  â™«

246
00:22:42,885 --> 00:22:48,260
â™«  Itâ€™s not illusory glamor  â™«

247
00:22:48,260 --> 00:22:50,800
â™«  Why fear the flying sand on the road ahead  â™«

248
00:22:50,800 --> 00:22:53,609
â™«  Chasing time, riding a white horse  â™«

249
00:22:53,609 --> 00:22:58,324
â™«  Let's go together  â™«

250
00:22:58,324 --> 00:23:00,884
â™«  Love is pure and originally flawless  â™«

251
00:23:00,884 --> 00:23:03,725
â™«  Let the vast universe change  â™«

252
00:23:03,725 --> 00:23:05,830
â™«  Let's spend our time together  â™«

253
00:23:05,830 --> 00:23:08,640
   

254
00:23:14,620 --> 00:23:17,160
Go over and lead the horse.

255
00:23:17,160 --> 00:23:21,880
Great Chief. Madam. You are finally back.

256
00:23:22,640 --> 00:23:24,820
Sorry to have worried you.

257
00:23:33,200 --> 00:23:35,176
Madam, don't worry.

258
00:23:37,040 --> 00:23:39,840
I am not anxious at all.

259
00:23:39,840 --> 00:23:42,480
   

260
00:23:44,960 --> 00:23:49,820
The ancestors of the Shen family, if you are watching us in the heaven,

261
00:23:49,820 --> 00:23:53,240
Great Chief finally came to understand!

262
00:23:54,100 --> 00:23:58,560
He understands now! He understands now!

263
00:24:10,200 --> 00:24:12,280
It is getting late.

264
00:24:15,000 --> 00:24:17,340
My Wife, please rest early.

265
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:21,876
All right.

266
00:24:30,720 --> 00:24:32,436
Where are you going?

267
00:24:33,960 --> 00:24:36,216
Going to sleep.

268
00:24:55,180 --> 00:24:58,160
I have a more important matter to attend to with you.

269
00:24:59,200 --> 00:25:02,106
Shen Du, Iâ€¦

270
00:25:02,106 --> 00:25:07,347
â™«  Every memory is unforgettable  â™«

271
00:25:07,347 --> 00:25:11,863
â™«  Written from desolation into poetry  â™«

272
00:25:12,760 --> 00:25:14,880
You said...

273
00:25:15,840 --> 00:25:18,440
I won't be alone anymore.

274
00:25:19,880 --> 00:25:23,060
If you had the nerve to barge in here,

275
00:25:23,060 --> 00:25:25,700
then there's no getting out of here.

276
00:25:28,280 --> 00:25:33,240
If I, Sxith Miss Yan, promise it,

277
00:25:33,240 --> 00:25:35,190
then it is a promise.

278
00:25:38,760 --> 00:25:44,587
â™«  If we are not careful, we will end up at the end of the world  â™«

279
00:25:44,587 --> 00:25:47,400
â™«  I want to be with you, shadows become a pair  â™«

280
00:25:47,400 --> 00:25:51,392
â™«  I want to hold you, staying by my side  â™«

281
00:25:51,392 --> 00:25:55,424
â™«  Passing through the obstruction of a storm  â™«

282
00:25:55,424 --> 00:25:58,166
â™«  I want to be your moonlight  â™«

283
00:25:58,166 --> 00:26:02,084
â™«  To accompany you to every dawn  â™«

284
00:26:02,084 --> 00:26:08,700
â™«  How I wish I could just forget the length of time  â™«

285
00:26:08,700 --> 00:26:11,454
â™«  I want to be with you, shadows become a pair  â™«

286
00:26:11,454 --> 00:26:15,446
â™«  I want to be with you, never forgetting each other  â™«

287
00:26:15,446 --> 00:26:19,434
â™«  There is always a place where the clouds and the sea meet  â™«

288
00:26:19,434 --> 00:26:22,135
â™«  I want to accompany you forever  â™«

289
00:26:22,135 --> 00:26:26,098
â™«  I will wait until my black hair turns grey  â™«

290
00:26:26,098 --> 00:26:35,123
â™«  In this life, I will only keep you in my heart  â™«

291
00:26:42,680 --> 00:26:45,720
Minister Zhang is here.

292
00:26:56,380 --> 00:26:59,800
Grand Empress Dowager sent me here to grant the reward.

293
00:26:59,800 --> 00:27:03,760
To promote Yan Xing as the Chief Director under the jurisdiction of the Ministry of Justice,

294
00:27:03,760 --> 00:27:06,940
and grant her ten thousand bolts of silk and ten thousand taels of gold,

295
00:27:06,940 --> 00:27:11,140
to show her merit and spread grace.

296
00:27:12,740 --> 00:27:15,880
Thanks to Grand Empress Dowager for the reward!

297
00:27:27,500 --> 00:27:30,160
Grand Empress Dowager has another decree.

298
00:27:37,420 --> 00:27:41,780
The Grand Empress Dowager has decreed. The Great Chief, Shen Du,

299
00:27:41,780 --> 00:27:44,940
has put down a rebellion and brought peace to the various counties,

300
00:27:44,940 --> 00:27:48,220
with outstanding merits and strong observations.

301
00:27:48,220 --> 00:27:53,780
Princess Jia'an is gentle, beautiful, polite, mannered,

302
00:27:53,780 --> 00:27:57,080
graceful, elegant, educated and dignified,

303
00:27:57,080 --> 00:27:59,880
who has reached the age of marriage, awaiting for a great husband.

304
00:27:59,880 --> 00:28:02,120
The two share a match made by heaven.

305
00:28:02,120 --> 00:28:05,280
Today, I hereby bestow them marriage,

306
00:28:05,280 --> 00:28:07,270
hoping they devote themselves to the country with respect

307
00:28:07,270 --> 00:28:10,080
and unite in heart and virtue.

308
00:28:23,060 --> 00:28:26,620
Great Chief, this is the Grand Empress Dowager's decree,

309
00:28:26,620 --> 00:28:29,520
not something you can say no.

310
00:28:30,280 --> 00:28:33,320
At least, accept the decree first.

311
00:29:02,780 --> 00:29:05,300
Minister Zhang, you know it.

312
00:29:05,300 --> 00:29:08,300
I have no intention of marrying Princess Jia'an.

313
00:29:08,300 --> 00:29:12,160
My wife does not want me to marry another woman.

314
00:29:12,160 --> 00:29:14,780
I hope to report back to the Grand Empress Dowager.

315
00:29:19,140 --> 00:29:23,120
Do you know why the Grand Empress Dowager had me announce this decree?

316
00:29:23,120 --> 00:29:26,340
Such a work should be performed by the people of the Astronomical Bureau.

317
00:29:26,340 --> 00:29:28,660
Why me?

318
00:29:29,740 --> 00:29:31,736
Why?

319
00:29:32,640 --> 00:29:34,680
You don't understand.

320
00:29:35,860 --> 00:29:38,220
Neither does Great Chief?

321
00:29:44,840 --> 00:29:49,260
Please explain it. Don't play riddles with me.

322
00:29:52,520 --> 00:29:57,160
Considering Han Shiyuan has now married into your Yan family, I shall tell you this,

323
00:29:57,160 --> 00:30:01,500
lest Shiyuan knows about it later and blames me.

324
00:30:01,500 --> 00:30:04,380
Just think, Princess Jia'an

325
00:30:04,380 --> 00:30:08,380
is the most beloved daughter of the Princess of Valor.

326
00:30:08,380 --> 00:30:12,680
And the Princess of Valor is the most beloved princess of the Grand Empress Dowager.

327
00:30:12,680 --> 00:30:16,080
The Princess of Valor's temperament is most similar to that of the Grand Empress Dowager,

328
00:30:16,080 --> 00:30:21,680
so she receives the most favor, even overshadowing Prince Xian.

329
00:30:21,680 --> 00:30:23,510
Under such a circumstance,

330
00:30:23,510 --> 00:30:27,860
yet she bestowed Princess Jia'an upon Great Chief as a wife.

331
00:30:27,860 --> 00:30:30,060
What does that mean?

332
00:30:30,060 --> 00:30:32,650
The Great Chief is so powerful,

333
00:30:32,650 --> 00:30:36,080
with outstanding merits, and unprecedented honor and wealth.

334
00:30:36,080 --> 00:30:39,020
No one can exceed him.

335
00:30:39,020 --> 00:30:42,580
But the Great Chief is alone, without any support behind him.

336
00:30:42,580 --> 00:30:44,380
Moreover,

337
00:30:45,240 --> 00:30:48,680
he has married you, a minor official of the sixth rank.

338
00:30:48,680 --> 00:30:51,020
Even if Princess Jia'an were to marry,

339
00:30:51,020 --> 00:30:55,460
she should choose her husband from the royal family.

340
00:30:55,460 --> 00:30:57,720
She has no reason to marry Shen Du.

341
00:30:57,720 --> 00:31:03,340
 Your father has said, only Shen Du remains in the Shen family now. 

342
00:31:03,340 --> 00:31:08,520
 Only Mo Qianzhi and that butler were associated with the Shen family. 

343
00:31:08,520 --> 00:31:11,280
 Mo Qianzhi is already dead. 

344
00:31:11,280 --> 00:31:17,220
 Then Shen Du is really the most lonely person in the imperial court. 

345
00:31:17,220 --> 00:31:19,760
 Also, he holds the position of supervising hundreds of officials. 

346
00:31:19,760 --> 00:31:26,060
 Any slight mistake could kill him. 

347
00:31:31,120 --> 00:31:32,880
So,

348
00:31:34,340 --> 00:31:37,360
you can't catch the wolf without sacrificing the kid.

349
00:31:38,920 --> 00:31:41,480
And Shen Du is the key.

350
00:31:49,260 --> 00:31:51,088
Minister Zhang,

351
00:31:52,380 --> 00:31:56,740
No matter how much the Grand Empress Dowager is wary of me, I can endure it.

352
00:32:05,740 --> 00:32:08,000
But I don't need the bestowed marriage.

353
00:32:12,160 --> 00:32:15,060
I already have a wife.

354
00:32:15,060 --> 00:32:17,600
And I will not marry another woman in my life.

355
00:32:27,540 --> 00:32:29,420
Minister Zhang.

356
00:32:31,240 --> 00:32:34,260
I will now return to the palace with you to annul the engagement.

357
00:32:38,500 --> 00:32:40,140
Shen Du.

358
00:32:40,140 --> 00:32:42,320
- Great Chief. 
 - Shen Du.

359
00:32:44,890 --> 00:32:48,240
   

360
00:32:56,940 --> 00:32:59,960
Are you thinking of defying the imperial decree?

361
00:32:59,960 --> 00:33:02,980
Grand Empress Dowager, my wife and I share a very deep affection.

362
00:33:02,980 --> 00:33:06,100
Moreover, I am in charge of the cabinet, supervising the officials and receiving many complaints.

363
00:33:06,100 --> 00:33:07,820
Itâ€™s not about wealth and good fortune.

364
00:33:07,820 --> 00:33:11,200
I don't want Princess Jia'an to marry me and suffer.

365
00:33:11,200 --> 00:33:13,420
If I hadn't bestowed the marriage,

366
00:33:13,420 --> 00:33:16,340
the esteemed Princess Jia'an would not be someone you can aspire to reach.

367
00:33:16,340 --> 00:33:19,780
The esteemed Princess Jia'an holds a noble status; I know I am unworthy.

368
00:33:19,780 --> 00:33:21,230
And I would not dare to covet her.

369
00:33:21,230 --> 00:33:23,440
I humbly request the Grand Empress Dowager to retract the decree.

370
00:33:23,440 --> 00:33:25,020
You!

371
00:33:26,380 --> 00:33:28,112
How dare you!

372
00:33:33,920 --> 00:33:36,160
I have been an official for many years,

373
00:33:37,340 --> 00:33:40,400
never wanting anything.

374
00:33:41,300 --> 00:33:45,160
Only today do I earnestly request Your Majesty to retract the decree.

375
00:33:45,160 --> 00:33:49,820
I will surely serve with utmost dedication, even to the point of death.

376
00:33:53,600 --> 00:33:56,080
Great Chief Shen has always been loyal.

377
00:33:56,080 --> 00:34:00,000
Everyone knows it. Your Majesty must think carefully before you act.

378
00:34:02,640 --> 00:34:06,300
I know you have paved the way for me.

379
00:34:06,300 --> 00:34:08,310
With a sincere heart, I stand in this world,

380
00:34:08,310 --> 00:34:10,380
devoted to relieving the Grand Empress Dowager's worries.

381
00:34:10,380 --> 00:34:14,180
If I need to marry Princess Jia'an to survive in the imperial court,

382
00:34:14,920 --> 00:34:18,920
then it must be Your Majesty who does not trust my ability.

383
00:34:20,580 --> 00:34:23,160
- Grand Empress Dowager. 
 - What is it that you want?

384
00:34:23,160 --> 00:34:25,280
Something's wrong at Ming Hall.

385
00:34:25,940 --> 00:34:27,572
What?

386
00:34:28,966 --> 00:34:33,613
   

387
00:34:40,120 --> 00:34:44,120
The people I sent have checked many times, no problems were discovered.

388
00:34:44,120 --> 00:34:46,840
But this time, it was their excessive greed

389
00:34:46,840 --> 00:34:49,560
that exposed a flaw, which was noticed.

390
00:34:49,560 --> 00:34:53,920
When we went back to check, we discovered the problem.

391
00:34:53,920 --> 00:34:57,200
Someone made two account books.

392
00:34:57,200 --> 00:35:02,140
Two account books? What's the difference between them?

393
00:35:02,140 --> 00:35:06,780
One is an open account book, using the Longmen accounting method. 
  (The Longmen accounting system is one of the earliest forms of double-entry bookkeeping in China.) 

394
00:35:06,780 --> 00:35:09,340
And the other one was kept in secret,

395
00:35:09,340 --> 00:35:12,430
using the Sijiao accounting method. 
  (The Sijiao account format is a traditional Chinese double-entry accounting format, where each page is divided by a central line to record income at the top and expenses at the bottom.) 

396
00:35:13,130 --> 00:35:15,320
Continue.

397
00:35:15,320 --> 00:35:19,460
The person who makes the open one with the Longmen accounting method

398
00:35:19,460 --> 00:35:21,700
is really skillful.

399
00:35:21,700 --> 00:35:25,760
At first glance, one can't find any mistakes.

400
00:35:25,760 --> 00:35:28,720
Therefore, from the beginning of the Ming Hall to the present,

401
00:35:28,720 --> 00:35:32,240
the officials of the Ministry of Revenue could not find any problems.

402
00:35:32,240 --> 00:35:34,480
The other account book that has just been discovered

403
00:35:34,480 --> 00:35:36,260
uses Sijiao accounting method.

404
00:35:36,260 --> 00:35:39,900
Therefore, at first glance, one can't detect any connection

405
00:35:39,900 --> 00:35:41,800
to the Ming Hall's account book.

406
00:35:41,800 --> 00:35:44,060
By how much is it off?

407
00:35:58,560 --> 00:36:02,000
How dare they embezzle

408
00:36:02,000 --> 00:36:04,640
over twenty million taels of silver!

409
00:36:04,640 --> 00:36:08,440
Officials involved in the reconstruction were all involved,

410
00:36:08,440 --> 00:36:11,120
apart from Minister Zhang Baohuan.

411
00:36:11,120 --> 00:36:16,880
Baohuan is not good at this accounting nor does he have the nerve.

412
00:36:17,720 --> 00:36:22,040
But the matter of Ming Hall

413
00:36:22,040 --> 00:36:25,240
was entrusted to him for overall planning.

414
00:36:25,240 --> 00:36:28,040
Then he is guilty of inadequate supervision.

415
00:36:28,040 --> 00:36:33,700
Send him to the other retreat for a quiet recuperation and reflection.

416
00:36:33,700 --> 00:36:34,600
Yes.

417
00:36:34,600 --> 00:36:36,920
As for the othersâ€¦

418
00:36:36,920 --> 00:36:41,540
These officials belong to various factions in the imperial court.

419
00:36:42,920 --> 00:36:45,180
Various factions?

420
00:36:46,380 --> 00:36:49,760
Including someone in the Zhou family?

421
00:36:50,520 --> 00:36:54,200
I said something wrong! Grand Empress Dowager, please forgive me!

422
00:37:02,400 --> 00:37:05,220
What fault do you have?

423
00:37:05,760 --> 00:37:09,510
I just thought that although the officials in the court

424
00:37:09,510 --> 00:37:15,080
each had their own motives, they were all devoted to the nation.

425
00:37:15,080 --> 00:37:17,920
I never expected...

426
00:37:19,400 --> 00:37:24,360
that the sin started from something trivial.

427
00:37:24,360 --> 00:37:28,560
Now, dark forces are at play,

428
00:37:29,240 --> 00:37:32,140
and people's hearts are unpredictable.

429
00:37:32,720 --> 00:37:35,220
Grand Empress Dowager puts the country first.

430
00:37:35,220 --> 00:37:38,620
While the court officials harbor their own thoughts.

431
00:37:38,620 --> 00:37:41,760
Especially after the incident in Yingzhou involving Governor Mo Qianzhi,

432
00:37:41,760 --> 00:37:44,180
no one has yet taken over the post in Gannandao.

433
00:37:44,180 --> 00:37:47,520
I think they all seem quite impatient.

434
00:37:47,520 --> 00:37:52,240
It's time to give them a warning.

435
00:37:55,280 --> 00:37:57,260
Grand Empress Dowager.

436
00:37:57,840 --> 00:38:00,680
Shen Du's Imperial Guards seldom interact with others,

437
00:38:00,680 --> 00:38:03,140
and works with dedication and effort.

438
00:38:03,140 --> 00:38:05,060
It would be a good choice.

439
00:38:05,060 --> 00:38:08,920
But if he marries Princess Jia'an,

440
00:38:08,920 --> 00:38:13,500
I'm afraid there will be more constraints for him.

441
00:38:21,460 --> 00:38:27,160
You want to help him, let's see if he is clever enough.

442
00:38:31,760 --> 00:38:34,040
For the incident at Ming Hall,

443
00:38:34,040 --> 00:38:37,700
don't make it public and investigate secretly.

444
00:38:37,700 --> 00:38:39,180
Yes.

445
00:38:39,180 --> 00:38:44,260
The Imperial Inspectorate and Imperial Guards.

446
00:38:44,260 --> 00:38:47,040
Pass on my decrees separately.

447
00:39:24,830 --> 00:39:27,690
   

448
00:39:33,989 --> 00:39:36,284
   

449
00:39:49,880 --> 00:39:53,640
You really aren't afraid of anything.

450
00:39:53,640 --> 00:39:57,960
I thought that a beating was inevitable.

451
00:39:57,960 --> 00:40:00,800
It went smoother than I thought.

452
00:40:01,720 --> 00:40:07,220
Are you saying the matter of the bestowed marriage just passed like that?

453
00:40:07,840 --> 00:40:13,000
Not necessarily, the Grand Empress Dowager still hasn't vented her anger.

454
00:40:15,020 --> 00:40:17,480
But the matter of the bestowed marriage came quite weirdly.

455
00:40:17,480 --> 00:40:20,140
I'm afraid it has something to do with that booklet.

456
00:40:20,140 --> 00:40:22,150
Princess of Valor must have been afraid

457
00:40:22,150 --> 00:40:25,460
that I would reveal her funding to the Yingzhou Army.

458
00:40:25,460 --> 00:40:28,020
Hence, she asked the Grand Empress Dowager to bestow me a marriage,

459
00:40:28,020 --> 00:40:30,330
wanting to constrain me.

460
00:40:30,880 --> 00:40:35,560
But unfortunately, the Grand Empress Dowager has no time for this.

461
00:40:38,620 --> 00:40:41,520
A major incident occurred at Ming Hall.

462
00:40:43,940 --> 00:40:46,520
You knew about this all along?

463
00:40:50,380 --> 00:40:52,170
Shen Du,

464
00:40:53,180 --> 00:40:58,740
Madam Xu just happened to report this matter, did she do it on purpose?

465
00:40:58,740 --> 00:41:00,630
People don't know

466
00:41:00,630 --> 00:41:04,620
that Ming Hall has a deep meaning for the Grand Empress Dowager.

467
00:41:06,060 --> 00:41:09,380
It is the place that witnessed the affection between the Grand Empress Dowager and the former emperor.

468
00:41:09,380 --> 00:41:11,120
After the fire at Ming Hall,

469
00:41:11,120 --> 00:41:14,060
the Grand Empress Dowager was extremely concerned about the reconstruction.

470
00:41:14,060 --> 00:41:17,100
She not only sent Zhang Baohuan she trusts mostly to oversee it,

471
00:41:17,100 --> 00:41:20,600
but also said that renovation expenses are uncapped.

472
00:41:20,600 --> 00:41:23,180
Uncapped?

473
00:41:23,180 --> 00:41:25,910
Unlimited expenses don't mean that corrupt officials

474
00:41:25,910 --> 00:41:28,220
can line their own pockets.

475
00:41:28,940 --> 00:41:31,520
How much could that involve?

476
00:41:32,500 --> 00:41:35,700
It could probably shake the entire imperial court.

477
00:41:37,040 --> 00:41:40,640
They have thoroughly angered the Grand Empress Dowager.

478
