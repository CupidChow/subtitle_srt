 "Go Ahead Fearlessly" - Liu Yuning 

3
00:00:32,023 --> 00:00:34,970
♫  Grudges and karma, right and wrong  ♫

4
00:00:34,970 --> 00:00:38,260
♫  The past hides blood and tears  ♫

5
00:00:38,261 --> 00:00:40,650
♫  It is hard to catch up after years of separation  ♫

6
00:00:40,650 --> 00:00:44,520
♫  The truth cannot be fully revealed  ♫

7
00:00:44,528 --> 00:00:47,630
♫  Fate is full of twists and turns  ♫

8
00:00:47,630 --> 00:00:50,830
♫  Life and death, fortune and misfortune go hand in hand  ♫

9
00:00:50,838 --> 00:00:55,939
♫  Obsession is hard to get rid of, keeping the truth 
 and getting rid of the lies, let the wind blow  ♫

10
00:00:55,939 --> 00:01:02,211
♫  Tossed about by the wind and rain, I will never regret it, 
 I will accompany you for my whole life  ♫

11
00:01:02,211 --> 00:01:08,619
♫  At least you share my joy and sorrow  ♫

12
00:01:08,619 --> 00:01:14,898
♫  Unravelling fate, fearlessly, a dream returns  ♫

13
00:01:14,898 --> 00:01:21,211
♫  The mountains and rivers are bright and beautiful, 
 holding hands, together we return  ♫

14
00:01:21,211 --> 00:01:28,655
♫  In this life, my heart returns untainted of dust and ash  ♫

15
00:01:28,655 --> 00:01:37,189
   

16
00:01:37,189 --> 00:01:40,224
   

17
00:01:44,870 --> 00:01:47,340
   

18
00:01:59,220 --> 00:02:01,300
Morning, Great Chief.

19
00:02:01,300 --> 00:02:06,700
It's not morning anymore. It seems that the Ministry of Justice is not very strict in rules.

20
00:02:07,460 --> 00:02:12,580
Thanks to you. I slept so well last night.

21
00:02:14,140 --> 00:02:18,380
You said the second branch of the Liang family is not the murderer. How certain are you?

22
00:02:18,380 --> 00:02:20,090
Almost certain.

23
00:02:21,140 --> 00:02:26,780
Go on then. Now your head is still on your neck.

24
00:02:26,780 --> 00:02:29,250
If I keep staying up all night like this,

25
00:02:29,250 --> 00:02:32,340
even with a head, I would still have to go to the underworld.

26
00:02:32,340 --> 00:02:34,304
 My Lord. 

27
00:02:35,700 --> 00:02:39,240
My Lord. Madam. Time for breakfast.

28
00:02:39,240 --> 00:02:41,320
I have no appetite.

29
00:02:46,940 --> 00:02:50,780
Wow. What a mess.

30
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:54,860
Yan Xing.

31
00:03:03,240 --> 00:03:05,820
- Sixth Miss. 
 - Chuichui.

32
00:03:05,820 --> 00:03:09,140
Seriously? Doesn't the Shen Mansion provide you with meals?

33
00:03:09,140 --> 00:03:11,260
- If I eat with him, I'm afraid I'll choke. 
 - She's still alive.

34
00:03:11,260 --> 00:03:13,540
Looks like she's fine. Let's go.

35
00:03:13,540 --> 00:03:16,500
Choke? No way.

36
00:03:16,500 --> 00:03:20,480
I heard that you and White Ghost are very much in love.

37
00:03:20,480 --> 00:03:23,180
A good Jack makes a good Jill.

38
00:03:23,180 --> 00:03:25,600
I've heard all about you two riding a horse together.

39
00:03:25,600 --> 00:03:27,740
Tell me the truth.

40
00:03:27,740 --> 00:03:32,380
Indeed, good news stays within, but bad news spreads far and wide.

41
00:03:32,380 --> 00:03:37,580
Bad news? You're now famous among the circle of noblewomen in the Imperial City.

42
00:03:37,580 --> 00:03:41,620
Back then, there was a woman who faked fainting and fell into Shen Du's arms.

43
00:03:41,620 --> 00:03:46,560
And she got arrested by the Imperial Guards and sentenced for the crime of offending the Great Chief.

44
00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:48,820
It really is his style.

45
00:03:48,820 --> 00:03:54,280
Since then, once the women in Xiang'an City see White Ghost, they avoid him like the plague.

46
00:03:54,280 --> 00:03:59,020
I can't believe he would show affection with you in the street and have close contact.

47
00:03:59,020 --> 00:04:01,480
It's better to have less contact.

48
00:04:10,080 --> 00:04:12,084
This is…

49
00:04:15,020 --> 00:04:17,640
On the night of your wedding, Ming Hall was on fire.

50
00:04:17,640 --> 00:04:21,260
The Grand Empress Dowager was furious. Several people from the Imperial Guards were held accountable.

51
00:04:21,260 --> 00:04:23,360
Even your husband was fined his salary.

52
00:04:23,360 --> 00:04:25,860
I didn't know that.

53
00:04:25,860 --> 00:04:28,920
I heard about that poor scholar named Chen Baiyi.

54
00:04:28,920 --> 00:04:33,460
He set himself on fire in the Ming Hall because he sought fame but failed.

55
00:04:33,460 --> 00:04:38,180
He is dead. His family should have been implicated, but…

56
00:04:38,180 --> 00:04:42,680
only this nearly sixty-year-old, blind, and deaf old lady is left in his family.

57
00:04:42,680 --> 00:04:45,760
The Grand Empress Dowager showed mercy and wanted to pardon her.

58
00:04:45,760 --> 00:04:51,020
But this old lady went to the Ministry of Justice to stage a sit-in, insisting on seeking justice.

59
00:04:51,020 --> 00:04:53,100
She's been sitting for a day and a night.

60
00:04:53,100 --> 00:04:57,220
Just think, who would dare to take it on?

61
00:04:59,580 --> 00:05:02,220
- Do you want to die? 
 - I have to die sooner or later.

62
00:05:02,220 --> 00:05:04,300
Anyway, I can only die once.

63
00:05:06,620 --> 00:05:09,440
Old lady, please stand up first.

64
00:05:09,440 --> 00:05:13,220
If there is really an injustice, we will certainly give you an explanation.

65
00:05:21,800 --> 00:05:24,220
Thank you, Miss!

66
00:05:33,720 --> 00:05:37,660
Who had the nerve to take that old lady's case?

67
00:05:37,660 --> 00:05:39,540
Come on, step forward.

68
00:05:39,540 --> 00:05:42,380
I'm in a good mood. I promise I won't beat you to death.

69
00:05:42,380 --> 00:05:45,020
Who took her case?

70
00:05:45,020 --> 00:05:49,240
That old lady at the gate? I've already sent her home.

71
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:55,960
Dismissed.

72
00:05:55,960 --> 00:05:58,280
Go, dismissed.

73
00:06:00,792 --> 00:06:03,102
   

74
00:06:05,220 --> 00:06:07,200
Why is it you again?

75
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:19,240
Actually, that old lady should be properly consoled.

76
00:06:19,240 --> 00:06:22,640
Otherwise, she'll keep sitting at the gate of the Ministry of Justice.

77
00:06:30,480 --> 00:06:32,420
Regarding the case of Chen Baiyi,

78
00:06:32,420 --> 00:06:36,120
- I have already taken it very seriously… 
 - The follow-up of this case is handed over to…

79
00:06:36,940 --> 00:06:38,600
Feng Gui!

80
00:06:39,960 --> 00:06:42,740
Keep an eye on that old lady, don't let her come again.

81
00:06:42,740 --> 00:06:45,240
I'll pass.

82
00:06:46,660 --> 00:06:49,160
Director Wu, I think…

83
00:06:50,900 --> 00:06:52,880
Come here.

84
00:06:56,080 --> 00:07:00,920
The murder case of Liang Chenzhong from the Liang Mansion has been taken over by the Imperial Guards.

85
00:07:00,920 --> 00:07:03,280
Everyone,

86
00:07:09,660 --> 00:07:11,500
stay out of it.

87
00:07:11,500 --> 00:07:16,660
The Imperial Guards is not something you can interfere with at will.

88
00:07:16,660 --> 00:07:20,140
If anyone doesn't obey, I will punish him severely.

89
00:07:20,140 --> 00:07:22,500
 - Yes. 
 - Yes. 

90
00:07:22,500 --> 00:07:24,600
Go get busy.

91
00:07:27,480 --> 00:07:30,000
Director Wu, I…

92
00:07:30,980 --> 00:07:34,520
Yan Xing. Chuichui.

93
00:07:34,520 --> 00:07:38,620
Don't you two still have case files to organize? Go for it.

94
00:07:38,620 --> 00:07:40,040
I…

95
00:07:40,040 --> 00:07:45,780
Sixth Miss, I suddenly remembered that Great Chief Shen invited you to lunch.

96
00:07:47,800 --> 00:07:49,560
It's late now.

97
00:07:49,560 --> 00:07:53,420
Well, it's not urgent. Lunch is more important.

98
00:07:53,420 --> 00:07:55,580
Lunch is more important.

99
00:07:57,980 --> 00:07:59,668
Let's go.

100
00:08:01,474 --> 00:08:03,100
   

101
00:08:03,100 --> 00:08:06,500
 Don't care about your small business. Follow me. 

102
00:08:06,500 --> 00:08:08,260
 Okay. Then I'll follow you. 

103
00:08:08,260 --> 00:08:10,126
My apologies, official lady.

104
00:08:10,126 --> 00:08:12,034
   

105
00:08:13,260 --> 00:08:17,060
Tongming Hall has rules that only male guests are accepted. No female guests are allowed.

106
00:08:17,060 --> 00:08:20,540
We are not guests. We are here to investigate a case.

107
00:08:21,700 --> 00:08:25,280
Well, send a male official here to investigate.

108
00:08:26,300 --> 00:08:27,830
I am a clerk.

109
00:08:27,830 --> 00:08:32,500
However, she is a dignified ninth-rank recording official, as noted by the Ministry of Justice.

110
00:08:32,500 --> 00:08:37,479
If you block us, maybe you are objecting to the government's system of selecting officials.

111
00:08:37,479 --> 00:08:39,170
Please don't make it difficult for me.

112
00:08:39,170 --> 00:08:41,420
If today we allow you two to come in,

113
00:08:41,420 --> 00:08:45,000
I'm afraid I might lose this job.

114
00:08:48,700 --> 00:08:52,840
Well, take another careful look,

115
00:08:53,420 --> 00:08:57,660
if we are male guests or female guests.

116
00:09:00,100 --> 00:09:02,560
Male guests. Please come in.

117
00:09:06,600 --> 00:09:10,700
    
 How could Zhanxin be so miserable?

118
00:09:10,700 --> 00:09:14,320
I thought that she could be a wife to Liang Chenzhong...

119
00:09:15,300 --> 00:09:18,400
and form a happy family.

120
00:09:18,400 --> 00:09:22,920
Who would be that cruel to kill her?

121
00:09:27,640 --> 00:09:30,740
My condolences. Do you still remember?

122
00:09:30,740 --> 00:09:35,540
Before Kuang Zhanxin went missing, did anything unusual happen?

123
00:09:35,540 --> 00:09:39,740
Or did she ever have a dispute with someone?

124
00:09:39,740 --> 00:09:42,020
Zhanxin has always been gentle,

125
00:09:42,020 --> 00:09:45,260
getting along well with everyone.

126
00:09:45,260 --> 00:09:47,750
Until the officials came to inform us last night,

127
00:09:47,750 --> 00:09:51,400
didn't you know that Kuang Zhanxin was missing?

128
00:09:51,400 --> 00:09:54,720
She left on the seventeenth of last month

129
00:09:54,720 --> 00:09:58,100
to go on an outing with Liang Chenzhong.

130
00:09:58,100 --> 00:10:01,860
Liang Chenzhong had taken her out for fun before.

131
00:10:01,860 --> 00:10:05,840
I thought this time, she just went for a bit longer.

132
00:10:07,860 --> 00:10:12,100
If we need further information, we'll come and ask again. Please accept our condolences.

133
00:10:19,980 --> 00:10:23,920
I heard that Chen Baiyi set himself on fire and also set the Ming Hall on fire.

134
00:10:23,920 --> 00:10:26,280
Fortunately, you drove him out early.

135
00:10:26,280 --> 00:10:29,400
Great Cang values much on nepotism.

136
00:10:29,400 --> 00:10:33,460
He's from a poor family and still wanted to become a noble.

137
00:10:33,460 --> 00:10:35,980
It’s sheer folly.

138
00:10:35,980 --> 00:10:39,960
He's lucky to polish my essays for me.

139
00:10:39,960 --> 00:10:42,700
Yet he was still not content.

140
00:10:42,700 --> 00:10:47,220
This bunch of poor scholars just don't know what gratefulness is.

141
00:10:47,220 --> 00:10:52,080
How dare he, just being a study companion, try to get first place in the Hongwen School literary competition!

142
00:10:52,080 --> 00:10:53,280
- Come on, drink. 
 - Come on.

143
00:10:53,280 --> 00:10:56,280
Sixth Miss. Sixth Miss?

144
00:10:57,680 --> 00:10:59,200
Let's go.

145
00:11:08,700 --> 00:11:11,000
- Sixth Miss. 
 - Marshal Xu.

146
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:12,920
Imperial Secretariat Lu.

147
00:11:14,060 --> 00:11:18,080
Marshal Xu, you're here at Tongming Hall for a case?

148
00:11:18,080 --> 00:11:21,220
It's the case obtained by your husband.

149
00:11:22,840 --> 00:11:25,360
I guess I shouldn't call you Sixth Miss anymore.

150
00:11:25,360 --> 00:11:28,560
I should call you Madam Shen.

151
00:11:28,560 --> 00:11:31,880
Marshal Xu, as always, call me Sixth Miss.

152
00:11:31,880 --> 00:11:34,740
Fine. Then from now on, don't call me Marshal Xu anymore.

153
00:11:34,740 --> 00:11:36,320
Call me Brother Xu.

154
00:11:36,320 --> 00:11:38,280
Okay, Brother Xu.

155
00:11:38,280 --> 00:11:40,480
After the matter of Kuang Zhanxin got out,

156
00:11:40,480 --> 00:11:44,120
the owners of the shops near Pingkang Alley act as if they are obsessed,

157
00:11:44,120 --> 00:11:48,340
feeling like the ladies from their own shops who have been out for a long time and not returned are missing.

158
00:11:48,340 --> 00:11:49,900
There are a dozen cases already.

159
00:11:49,900 --> 00:11:52,520
- More people are missing? 
 - No.

160
00:11:52,520 --> 00:11:56,380
Among seventeen girls who were reported missing, fifteen have already been found.

161
00:11:56,380 --> 00:11:59,300
And the two remaining, are probably fine.

162
00:11:59,300 --> 00:12:03,280
But there is one thing I haven't decided whether to report it yet.

163
00:12:03,280 --> 00:12:05,260
And then I met you here.

164
00:12:06,600 --> 00:12:10,380
This records the cases of missing musical performers over the years. 
    

165
00:12:18,260 --> 00:12:20,000
Weird.

166
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:24,400
These performers are not the most popular,

167
00:12:24,400 --> 00:12:26,000
but all are well-versed in music and rhythm,

168
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:28,240
specializing in instrumental music and skilled at playing the pipa.

169
00:12:28,240 --> 00:12:29,520
Exactly.

170
00:12:29,520 --> 00:12:33,380
It's just too coincidental. That's why it feels suspicious.

171
00:12:38,120 --> 00:12:41,020
These are the portraits of the missing women.

172
00:12:48,600 --> 00:12:53,740
These women all have the same flying fairy hairstyle.

173
00:13:00,820 --> 00:13:03,000
Anything else?

174
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:04,680
Look.

175
00:13:04,680 --> 00:13:07,680
The faces of these women are different,

176
00:13:07,680 --> 00:13:09,960
yet they all have something in common.

177
00:13:09,960 --> 00:13:13,400
- Especially in demeanor, they are extremely similar. 
 - Yes.

178
00:13:13,400 --> 00:13:18,820
At first glance, there is an indescribable similarity among them.

179
00:13:19,820 --> 00:13:22,600
I was thinking of handing these files over to the Ministry of Justice,

180
00:13:22,600 --> 00:13:25,440
but I don't think it's okay to bypass the Imperial Guards.

181
00:13:25,440 --> 00:13:28,560
Now it seems it's best that you get it.

182
00:13:28,560 --> 00:13:32,660
White Ghost surely wouldn't draw his sword and kill his wife over this. Right?

183
00:13:57,120 --> 00:13:59,700
Then I shall take my leave first.

184
00:14:09,320 --> 00:14:12,220
You swore oaths at dawn and left.

185
00:14:12,220 --> 00:14:14,080
I wonder what you were investigating.

186
00:14:14,080 --> 00:14:15,680
So you were chatting here.

187
00:14:15,680 --> 00:14:20,360
I am discussing the case with Marshal Xu, who commands all the inspectors of the Imperial City.

188
00:14:20,360 --> 00:14:22,520
Commands all the inspectors?

189
00:14:22,520 --> 00:14:24,860
This is impressive.

190
00:14:24,860 --> 00:14:28,400
Back in the day, Marshal Xu was a grand criminal wanted by the imperial court

191
00:14:28,400 --> 00:14:30,920
with a bounty of 100,000 taels.

192
00:14:30,920 --> 00:14:33,680
So, Marshal Xu is the one from the legends

193
00:14:33,680 --> 00:14:37,180
who infiltrated the palace and stole the Grand Empress Dowager's jade pillow.

194
00:14:37,180 --> 00:14:39,600
If he's that amazing, he wouldn't have been caught.

195
00:14:39,600 --> 00:14:42,240
Although he was caught, the Grand Empress Dowager appreciated his talent.

196
00:14:42,240 --> 00:14:45,420
Not only did she not punish him, but she also got rid of him as a slave.

197
00:14:45,420 --> 00:14:46,760
It's true that he was caught.

198
00:14:46,760 --> 00:14:49,940
- That means he was outsmarted and his skills were inferior. 
 - I…

199
00:14:49,940 --> 00:14:54,340
With someone like him, what information can you get?

200
00:14:54,340 --> 00:14:56,120
I can get information.

201
00:14:56,120 --> 00:14:59,560
As for my bet on the Liang family, I'm about to win.

202
00:15:00,800 --> 00:15:05,820
Every evidence now indicates that this is a years-long series of serial murders.

203
00:15:05,820 --> 00:15:10,500
Once I have found the murderer, the second branch of the Liang family could completely clear their name.

204
00:15:14,440 --> 00:15:16,440
Great Chief, the one watching the Liang family has reported back

205
00:15:16,440 --> 00:15:18,480
that the second branch was splashed with chicken blood by those from the main branch.

206
00:15:18,480 --> 00:15:19,800
The second madam has become even more insane.

207
00:15:19,800 --> 00:15:22,360
The third son went to the Ministry of Justice to turn himself in.

208
00:15:22,360 --> 00:15:25,560
And Princess of Valor wants to see you.

209
00:15:28,539 --> 00:15:30,501
   

210
00:15:33,520 --> 00:15:36,720
Princess of Valor only invites the Great Chief alone.

211
00:15:57,640 --> 00:15:59,480
Princess of Valor.

212
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:03,200
Liang Chenyu was imprisoned.

213
00:16:03,200 --> 00:16:06,640
This is not what the Grand Empress Dowager wanted.

214
00:16:10,700 --> 00:16:13,120
If I remember it correctly,

215
00:16:13,120 --> 00:16:18,020
the Grand Empress Dowager did not request you to thoroughly investigate this case,

216
00:16:19,160 --> 00:16:23,060
instead, to protect the second branch of the Liang family.

217
00:16:26,160 --> 00:16:30,020
We don't have enough evidence yet, so there is no conclusion.

218
00:16:43,560 --> 00:16:46,680
 Great Chief, you have always been meticulous. 

219
00:16:46,680 --> 00:16:50,920
But this time, you have been slow to follow the rules in handling affairs.

220
00:16:51,760 --> 00:16:54,400
Don't be like your father,

221
00:16:56,080 --> 00:16:58,500
who makes significant moves silently.

222
00:17:06,119 --> 00:17:08,060
I dare not.

223
00:17:20,939 --> 00:17:23,040
Princess of Valor must be making things difficult for the Great Chief.

224
00:17:23,040 --> 00:17:25,170
The Grand Empress Dowager had given instructions regarding this case of the Liang Mansion

225
00:17:25,170 --> 00:17:26,419
to protect the second branch of the Liang family.

226
00:17:26,419 --> 00:17:28,040
Yet, you insist on investigating to the very end.

227
00:17:28,040 --> 00:17:30,400
And now, Third Young Master has been put into prison.

228
00:17:30,400 --> 00:17:33,240
Now, how can the Great Chief explain this?

229
00:17:35,280 --> 00:17:37,840
I will take responsibility for this case,

230
00:17:37,840 --> 00:17:40,400
and surely give an explanation to those who are above.

231
00:17:48,480 --> 00:17:53,580
The Grand Empress Dowager trusts you, so naturally, I also trust you.

232
00:17:53,580 --> 00:17:58,260
But I hope you don't let us down.

233
00:18:01,480 --> 00:18:06,980
I heard the new Madam Shen is very interesting.

234
00:18:10,460 --> 00:18:12,480
Grand Empress Dowager bestowed me a marriage,

235
00:18:12,480 --> 00:18:14,740
I am so grateful.

236
00:18:16,260 --> 00:18:18,280
 Great Chief! 

237
00:18:18,280 --> 00:18:22,540
Five pairs of bodies were dug up at Ximing Temple, who died the same way the other two did.

238
00:18:23,960 --> 00:18:25,960
In that case,

239
00:18:26,640 --> 00:18:29,920
this matter indeed has nothing to do with the second branch of the Liang family.

240
00:18:38,400 --> 00:18:40,880
The two before from Liang Chenzhong's case,

241
00:18:40,880 --> 00:18:43,460
there are six pairs of men and women, twelve bodies in total.

242
00:18:43,460 --> 00:18:45,360
The murderer killed them in the same way.

243
00:18:45,360 --> 00:18:48,680
The men had their hearts carved out, and the women were disfigured.

244
00:18:55,160 --> 00:18:57,680
This is not the soil of Ximing Temple.

245
00:18:58,400 --> 00:19:03,000
These bodies have been moved recently, and reburied anew.

246
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:05,880
Their faces turned purple, and their flesh turned inside out.

247
00:19:05,880 --> 00:19:08,940
But I can still tell this was a young woman.

248
00:19:08,940 --> 00:19:11,920
Can you estimate the time of death?

249
00:19:11,920 --> 00:19:16,120
These two people must have been killed the month before.

250
00:19:16,120 --> 00:19:20,420
Around the bodies, there are many layers of charcoal and plant ash.

251
00:19:20,420 --> 00:19:23,120
They must have been used to cover the smell.

252
00:19:26,160 --> 00:19:28,480
What exactly is this fragrance?

253
00:19:28,480 --> 00:19:30,360
Anything weird?

254
00:19:32,600 --> 00:19:37,800
If my master were here, he could definitely tell what is in it.

255
00:19:37,800 --> 00:19:41,200
In my opinion, you have already learned what your master taught you.

256
00:19:41,200 --> 00:19:43,520
And you are no less skilled than Pan Chi, the top detective.

257
00:19:43,520 --> 00:19:45,120
Not really.

258
00:19:45,120 --> 00:19:50,120
After my master retired, he traveled far and wide, and probably has almost forgotten about me.

259
00:19:51,520 --> 00:19:54,240
This is the first pair of bodies ever dug up.

260
00:19:54,240 --> 00:19:56,680
Their decomposition is the most severe.

261
00:19:56,680 --> 00:20:00,320
It's hard to tell the time of death.

262
00:20:00,320 --> 00:20:04,420
It should be within four to six years.

263
00:20:04,420 --> 00:20:08,660
If the murderer is the same person, that would be insane.

264
00:20:08,660 --> 00:20:12,420
He can disembowel and excise hearts, hemust be a strong man.

265
00:20:12,420 --> 00:20:14,500
Perhaps a butcher.

266
00:20:15,200 --> 00:20:20,360
In my opinion, the murderer is very likely a woman.

267
00:20:20,360 --> 00:20:21,800
Why?

268
00:20:21,800 --> 00:20:26,680
The position, length, and depth of the wounds on each face of the female body

269
00:20:26,680 --> 00:20:28,640
are almost identical.

270
00:20:28,640 --> 00:20:30,480
And the strength used in the stabbing,

271
00:20:30,480 --> 00:20:33,120
doesn't seem to be from a man.

272
00:20:33,120 --> 00:20:37,920
If the murderer is a woman, she would have to have killed twelve people over these years.

273
00:20:37,920 --> 00:20:41,300
These male victims were not the elderly or weak.

274
00:20:41,300 --> 00:20:43,720
They were all in their prime when they died.

275
00:20:43,720 --> 00:20:46,000
How could they possibly be outmatched by a woman?

276
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:49,760
Brother Xu, if you think it is impossible because you have not seen it,

277
00:20:49,760 --> 00:20:53,530
then many strange cases in this world cannot be solved.

278
00:20:54,120 --> 00:20:55,620
Let's go.

279
00:20:56,720 --> 00:20:58,180
You…

280
00:21:03,160 --> 00:21:05,780
What do you want to do?

281
00:21:15,240 --> 00:21:17,000
Princess of Valor has already instructed

282
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:20,120
that the case of Ximing Temple and the case of the Liang Mansion will be merged and handled together

283
00:21:20,120 --> 00:21:22,700
and placed under the management of the Imperial Guards.

284
00:21:22,700 --> 00:21:26,220
People from the Ministry of Justice must not interfere any more.

285
00:21:26,220 --> 00:21:28,400
Whatever.

286
00:21:28,400 --> 00:21:30,780
I'm going to take you to a place.

287
00:21:33,120 --> 00:21:34,520
Where to?

288
00:21:34,520 --> 00:21:36,032
You…

289
00:21:43,680 --> 00:21:46,580
 The scent of White Champaca lingers in her sleeves. 

290
00:21:46,580 --> 00:21:49,800
 A silk robe with a ruyi pattern brocade. 

291
00:21:49,800 --> 00:21:52,160
 A jade velvet flower hairpin. 

292
00:21:52,160 --> 00:21:54,880
 A peony-decorated white silk fan. 

293
00:21:59,400 --> 00:22:00,800
If you have time to be in a daze,

294
00:22:00,800 --> 00:22:05,400
you might as well think carefully about how to keep your life.

295
00:22:07,240 --> 00:22:09,480
Where exactly are we going?

296
00:22:11,200 --> 00:22:13,000
The Ministry of Justice.

297
00:22:19,400 --> 00:22:20,700
Put me down now.

298
00:22:20,700 --> 00:22:23,900
We're not far from the Ministry of Justice, I can walk there myself.

299
00:22:23,900 --> 00:22:27,100
The murderer has not yet been found, and Third Young Master is still in prison.

300
00:22:27,100 --> 00:22:31,200
If he dies, you'll die with him.

301
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:42,000
Great Chief Shen, the bet I placed has never been lost.

302
00:22:54,100 --> 00:22:56,800
Great Chief, what brings you here?

303
00:22:56,800 --> 00:22:58,500
Can't I come here?

304
00:22:58,500 --> 00:23:01,100
Great Chief, not at all. Welcome!

305
00:23:01,100 --> 00:23:04,800
I've come to ask you for a person to assist at the Imperial Guards.

306
00:23:04,800 --> 00:23:07,300
Great Chief, you want to transfer someone. Easy.

307
00:23:07,300 --> 00:23:10,800
Who do you want? I'll make the arrangements immediately.

308
00:23:13,400 --> 00:23:15,200
Her.

309
00:23:20,800 --> 00:23:24,400
The case of the ten corpses at Ximing Temple has been entirely entrusted to the Imperial Guards.

310
00:23:24,400 --> 00:23:26,000
The Ministry of Justice should stay out of it.

311
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:27,900
Yes.

312
00:23:27,900 --> 00:23:31,200
Great Chief, I have many case files unorganized.

313
00:23:31,200 --> 00:23:34,100
I'm afraid I can't be transferred to the Imperial Guards.

314
00:23:37,440 --> 00:23:40,640
Clerk Yan, what are you talking about?

315
00:23:41,500 --> 00:23:43,000
You have many case files unorganized.

316
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:44,700
Hand it over to Secretariat Lu.

317
00:23:44,700 --> 00:23:47,000
Hurry up and go with the Great Chief.

318
00:23:48,320 --> 00:23:50,360
If you don't come,

319
00:23:52,200 --> 00:23:53,800
then this case is concluded.

320
00:23:53,800 --> 00:23:55,700
Director Wu.

321
00:23:55,700 --> 00:23:58,000
Drag those bodies outside the city

322
00:23:58,000 --> 00:24:00,500
and bury them some place.

323
00:24:03,200 --> 00:24:04,600
No way!

324
00:24:04,600 --> 00:24:07,200
- I'll go now. 
 - Sixth Miss!

325
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:10,000
We got it from Chen Baiyi's house.

326
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:11,800
I've read all the essays he has written.

327
00:24:11,800 --> 00:24:14,200
Each piece is brilliantly written.

328
00:24:14,200 --> 00:24:16,800
During these days, you have worked a lot.

329
00:24:16,800 --> 00:24:19,400
It's fine. Let's watch a play in the Furong Garden.

330
00:24:19,400 --> 00:24:21,000
Approved.

331
00:24:22,600 --> 00:24:24,600
Be careful.

332
00:24:26,840 --> 00:24:30,300
Great Chief, the coroner has already completed the preliminary tests.

333
00:24:34,200 --> 00:24:35,800
Jing Lin.

334
00:24:35,800 --> 00:24:38,400
If people from the Ministry of Justice are found to be investigating this case privately,

335
00:24:38,400 --> 00:24:40,700
they shall be dealt with as acting for factionalism and personal gain.

336
00:24:40,700 --> 00:24:42,200
Yes.

337
00:24:42,200 --> 00:24:45,300
Then I must thank you for your support and favor,

338
00:24:45,300 --> 00:24:47,700
allowing me to get the right to investigate this case.

339
00:24:47,700 --> 00:24:51,100
I will surely do my best to solve the case as soon as possible.

340
00:24:51,100 --> 00:24:53,100
Glad that you know it.

341
00:24:53,700 --> 00:24:55,600
Since I've been transferred to the Imperial Guards,

342
00:24:55,600 --> 00:24:57,800
then I'd be a member of the Imperial Guards.

343
00:24:57,800 --> 00:25:00,110
So, I have to follow the rules of the Imperial Guards.

344
00:25:00,110 --> 00:25:01,800
I am just a clerk.

345
00:25:01,800 --> 00:25:05,500
How can I ride with you on the same horse?

346
00:25:07,680 --> 00:25:10,120
I am not skilled at riding.

347
00:25:11,500 --> 00:25:13,900
I believe Guard Jing is compassionate to his subordinates.

348
00:25:13,900 --> 00:25:16,800
You certainly won't leave me behind. Right?

349
00:25:16,800 --> 00:25:18,200
Me?

350
00:25:18,200 --> 00:25:22,000
Then today, I have to ride a horse with you.

351
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:24,800
If you wish to ride a horse, you should naturally be with the Great Chief.

352
00:25:24,800 --> 00:25:26,900
As for me…

353
00:25:38,700 --> 00:25:40,400
I will lead the horse for you.

354
00:25:40,400 --> 00:25:42,000
It's not appropriate.

355
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:43,300
Let's ride a horse together.

356
00:25:43,300 --> 00:25:44,400
When handling cases, there's no distinction between men and women.

357
00:25:44,400 --> 00:25:47,800
You can just treat me as a regular colleague.

358
00:25:47,800 --> 00:25:49,600
Madam, take your seat.

359
00:25:49,600 --> 00:25:51,000
How much longer do you have to chitchat?

360
00:25:51,000 --> 00:25:55,200
If you keep doing so, you'll be fined six months' salary.

361
00:25:56,200 --> 00:25:58,400
I…

362
00:25:58,400 --> 00:26:00,200
Great Chief!

363
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:16,000
These were taken from the bodies of the first victims.

364
00:26:19,300 --> 00:26:23,500
Supervised by the first year of the Shengli Era.

365
00:26:29,800 --> 00:26:33,200
It was worn by the body of the man who was first killed.

366
00:26:33,200 --> 00:26:37,400
The murderer's first crime should have been six years ago.

367
00:26:37,400 --> 00:26:39,000
Why?

368
00:26:43,200 --> 00:26:47,200
The murderer killed in the same way every time.

369
00:26:47,200 --> 00:26:50,200
There must be a pattern to the timing.

370
00:26:50,200 --> 00:26:53,400
A very small mistake makes a great difference.

371
00:26:53,400 --> 00:26:55,000
If we are wrong, then it won't be easy to find the murderer.

372
00:26:55,000 --> 00:26:58,400
If we are wrong, then it won't be easy to find the murderer.

373
00:27:06,600 --> 00:27:08,960
Double Fish Pattern.

374
00:27:14,800 --> 00:27:16,300
Jinxiu Workshop.

375
00:27:16,300 --> 00:27:19,800
This Double Fish Pattern was a specially made pattern by Jinxiu Workshop back then.

376
00:27:19,800 --> 00:27:21,600
It's so popular.

377
00:27:21,600 --> 00:27:24,300
Jinxiu Workshop was the largest silk square in the Imperial City,

378
00:27:24,300 --> 00:27:26,600
presenting tribute silks to the palace on the first day of every month.

379
00:27:26,600 --> 00:27:28,600
However, in the sixth month of the third year of the Shengli Era,

380
00:27:28,600 --> 00:27:31,200
Jinxiu Workshop was charged with the crime of insubordination

381
00:27:31,200 --> 00:27:33,400
for delaying the presenting of Princess Runing with summer clothes.

382
00:27:33,400 --> 00:27:35,000
Henceforth,

383
00:27:35,000 --> 00:27:38,800
no one in the Imperial City dared to wear clothes from Jinxiu Workshop out in public.

384
00:27:38,800 --> 00:27:42,800
This man must have died before the insubordination case of Jinxiu Workshop.

385
00:27:42,800 --> 00:27:45,000
The gold medal was made in the first year of the Shengli Era.

386
00:27:45,000 --> 00:27:47,500
Then he might have died in the first year of the Shengli Era.

387
00:27:47,500 --> 00:27:49,100
Impossible.

388
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:52,200
Double Fish Pattern was the style of spring clothes

389
00:27:52,200 --> 00:27:54,400
made by Jinxiu Workshop in the third year of the Shengli Era.

390
00:27:54,400 --> 00:27:56,800
It was only available between the second and fourth months back then.

391
00:27:56,800 --> 00:27:59,100
You remember it so clearly?

392
00:27:59,760 --> 00:28:02,400
The case file of the Jinxiu Workshop is in the Archive.

393
00:28:02,400 --> 00:28:03,800
There is a volume of illustrated catalogs,

394
00:28:03,800 --> 00:28:06,800
recording the patterns of Jinxiu Workshop over ten years.

395
00:28:06,800 --> 00:28:09,800
Jing Lin, go and confirm by comparison.

396
00:28:09,800 --> 00:28:11,700
Make no mistake.

397
00:28:11,700 --> 00:28:13,200
Yes.

398
00:28:22,700 --> 00:28:25,400
   

399
00:28:26,800 --> 00:28:29,600
Madam, the Archive is full of treasures and books.

400
00:28:29,600 --> 00:28:32,000
Do not wander around...

401
00:28:33,600 --> 00:28:36,030
or touch anything.

402
00:28:36,600 --> 00:28:39,400
Understood. We should split up to search.

403
00:28:39,400 --> 00:28:42,200
- You go over there. 
 - Don't touch anything.

404
00:28:57,000 --> 00:29:01,000
   

405
00:29:01,000 --> 00:29:03,100
   

406
00:29:06,100 --> 00:29:07,500
Hurry up.

407
00:29:07,500 --> 00:29:10,400
Hurry up. Don't drop it.

408
00:29:10,400 --> 00:29:12,700
What on earth is going on?

409
00:29:12,700 --> 00:29:14,800
Wait!

410
00:29:14,800 --> 00:29:16,600
Wait! Why are you here?

411
00:29:16,600 --> 00:29:19,800
- Weren't you transferred to the Imperial Guards? 
 - I want to see Director Wu.

412
00:29:19,800 --> 00:29:21,900
There's progress in the case of Chen Baiyi's self-immolation.

413
00:29:21,900 --> 00:29:26,400
He has already instructed that no one can mention the Ming Hall case again.

414
00:29:26,400 --> 00:29:28,400
If anyone mentions it again, he should submit his resignation.

415
00:29:28,400 --> 00:29:31,000
There really is an inside story. I want to see Director Wu.

416
00:29:31,000 --> 00:29:34,600
Wait. Didn't you see the entire Ministry of Justice

417
00:29:34,600 --> 00:29:36,900
got into trouble with a nursery rhyme?

418
00:29:36,900 --> 00:29:40,100
No one has time to investigate the self-immolation case.

419
00:29:40,100 --> 00:29:43,200
- Nursery rhyme? 
 - Don't you know it?

420
00:29:44,200 --> 00:29:45,600
Mind your head.

421
00:29:45,600 --> 00:29:48,400
It's spread to every household in the Imperial City.

422
00:29:48,400 --> 00:29:52,600
I wonder this time which place will suffer.

423
00:29:55,000 --> 00:29:56,800
Be careful. Mind the steps.

424
00:29:56,800 --> 00:29:59,700
 Ruthless people, merciless Buddha, 

425
00:29:59,700 --> 00:30:02,600
 under the sovereign, the order is in chaos. 

426
00:30:02,600 --> 00:30:05,400
 Merciless Buddha hides the sin. 

427
00:30:05,400 --> 00:30:07,600
Black Fiend is coming!

428
00:30:16,700 --> 00:30:18,400
Kid.

429
00:30:19,900 --> 00:30:24,200
Do you realize what you just said is grossly defiant and contrary to Taoism?

430
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:30,300
Well, how should I punish you?

431
00:30:31,400 --> 00:30:34,800
Try this new invention of a trap.

432
00:30:34,800 --> 00:30:38,800
Later, we'll put the pot on the fire.

433
00:30:39,520 --> 00:30:42,280
And you'll have even more fun.

434
00:30:43,600 --> 00:30:45,600
Guards.

435
00:30:47,800 --> 00:30:50,400
No, please no.

436
00:30:50,400 --> 00:30:52,600
No, please no. He is just a kid.

437
00:30:52,600 --> 00:30:54,400
Please spare him.

438
00:30:54,400 --> 00:30:57,600
If one can spread such defiant words,

439
00:30:57,600 --> 00:31:00,900
then the Imperial City will become a place without rules.

440
00:31:00,900 --> 00:31:02,800
- No, My Lord. 
 - Please spare us.

441
00:31:02,800 --> 00:31:06,400
If you do not properly educate your kid, then I'll do it for you.

442
00:31:06,400 --> 00:31:07,800
No, My Lord.

443
00:31:07,800 --> 00:31:10,900
Make way for the Princess of Valor's carriage.

444
00:31:24,400 --> 00:31:26,640
Princess of Valor.

445
00:31:33,400 --> 00:31:34,900
 This person looks somewhat familiar. 

446
00:31:34,900 --> 00:31:36,500
What is going on here?

447
00:31:36,500 --> 00:31:38,500
Your Highness, please save my child.

448
00:31:38,500 --> 00:31:41,000
Please save my child, Your Highness.

449
00:31:41,000 --> 00:31:43,700
I've come to patrol the streets today,

450
00:31:43,700 --> 00:31:47,400
suddenly I heard a child saying defiant words,

451
00:31:47,400 --> 00:31:49,700
so I caught him.

452
00:31:49,700 --> 00:31:51,800
Sorry to disturb you.

453
00:31:51,800 --> 00:31:53,200
I see.

454
00:31:53,200 --> 00:31:54,700
Your Highness, please show mercy.

455
00:31:54,700 --> 00:31:56,000
I'm sorry that my child speaks nonsense.

456
00:31:56,000 --> 00:31:58,400
I will certainly educate him well.

457
00:31:58,400 --> 00:31:59,800
Yes, Your Highness.

458
00:31:59,800 --> 00:32:01,900
Parents are to blame for children's misbehavior.

459
00:32:01,900 --> 00:32:04,500
You should be blamed.

460
00:32:10,600 --> 00:32:12,400
Vice Minister Lai,

461
00:32:12,400 --> 00:32:15,100
everyone makes mistakes.

462
00:32:15,100 --> 00:32:18,600
Moreover, he is just a kid.

463
00:32:18,600 --> 00:32:21,000
Vice Minister Lai, you've always been brilliant and wise.

464
00:32:21,000 --> 00:32:25,200
So why would you ruin your good reputation over a child?

465
00:32:25,200 --> 00:32:26,900
Even so…

466
00:32:26,900 --> 00:32:29,600
Since I have witnessed it today,

467
00:32:29,600 --> 00:32:35,400
it means this child is destined to meet me.

468
00:32:35,400 --> 00:32:36,600
Vice Minister Lai,

469
00:32:36,600 --> 00:32:42,000
could you perhaps spare this child for me?

470
00:32:49,920 --> 00:32:52,240
Since Your Highness said so,

471
00:32:52,240 --> 00:32:55,000
I naturally have to spare him.

472
00:32:56,500 --> 00:32:58,440
Release him.

473
00:32:58,440 --> 00:33:00,360
- Thank you. 
 - As long as the child is fine.

474
00:33:00,360 --> 00:33:02,800
- Thank you. 
 - You may leave.

475
00:33:02,800 --> 00:33:06,040
Thank you, Your Highness.

476
00:33:06,040 --> 00:33:08,760
Princess of Valor is truly compassionate.

477
00:33:08,760 --> 00:33:12,660
Princess of Valor is truly generous and merciful.

478
00:33:17,240 --> 00:33:19,640
Humbly, we see Your Highness off.

479
00:33:32,040 --> 00:33:35,140
- Get twenty strokes of the cane for punishment. 
 - Yes.

480
00:33:49,640 --> 00:33:52,140
 Who exactly is that woman? 

481
00:33:57,718 --> 00:33:59,581
   

482
00:34:02,360 --> 00:34:04,520
What's wrong?

483
00:34:04,520 --> 00:34:07,240
Lai Luozhi accused the Great Chief of being ineffective in investigating the case.

484
00:34:07,240 --> 00:34:10,620
So the Grand Empress Dowager issued an order to take the Great Chief away.

485
00:34:14,360 --> 00:34:16,900
You two guard the door. Tell me about anything of the Great Chief promptly.

486
00:34:16,900 --> 00:34:18,360
Yes.

487
00:34:19,120 --> 00:34:20,940
No entry.

488
00:34:23,400 --> 00:34:25,879
The Great Chief has instructed that without permission, no one is allowed to approach the office.

489
00:34:25,879 --> 00:34:27,536
If you…

490
00:34:28,840 --> 00:34:32,139
If you want to break in, step over me.

491
00:34:43,092 --> 00:34:46,300
Don't flip through. If you flip through, I'll show no mercy.

492
00:34:47,480 --> 00:34:49,460
Stop flipping through.

493
00:34:50,340 --> 00:34:53,680
- If you keep flipping through, I will take my own life. 
 - If you want your Great Chief to die,

494
00:34:53,680 --> 00:34:55,679
then do it.

495
00:34:56,819 --> 00:34:58,400
Grind the ink.

496
00:34:59,500 --> 00:35:01,364
Grind the ink.

497
00:35:04,760 --> 00:35:07,520
I hope it's not too late.

498
00:35:12,750 --> 00:35:14,508
   

499
00:35:28,602 --> 00:35:30,572
   

500
00:35:33,120 --> 00:35:36,320
 Her handwriting is surprisingly similar to that of the Great Chief. 

501
00:35:45,120 --> 00:35:47,360
Are you confident that this can really save the Great Chief?

502
00:35:47,360 --> 00:35:49,320
I can't guarantee it,

503
00:35:49,320 --> 00:35:50,940
but we should at least give it a try.

504
00:35:50,940 --> 00:35:53,200
Perhaps it can prevent him from severe punishment.

505
00:36:04,400 --> 00:36:06,760
What are you waiting for? Hurry up!

506
00:36:06,760 --> 00:36:08,960
I am waiting here.

507
00:36:08,960 --> 00:36:11,080
Stop flipping through.

508
00:36:18,000 --> 00:36:19,680
Grand Empress Dowager.

509
00:36:19,680 --> 00:36:23,180
The Imperial Guards have taken over the case for several days, yet they haven't solved it.

510
00:36:23,180 --> 00:36:28,380
Now, rumors are saying the imperial court is inept at selecting officials.

511
00:36:28,380 --> 00:36:32,180
Even worse, some speculate the emperor's intentions, saying we intend to shield the Liang family.

512
00:36:32,180 --> 00:36:35,400
It's a disgrace to your reputation.

513
00:36:35,400 --> 00:36:40,200
Grand Empress Dowager, please allow the Imperial Inspectorate to take over this case.

514
00:36:40,200 --> 00:36:45,840
What you said is exactly what I am concerned about.

515
00:36:47,720 --> 00:36:50,320
Shen Du from the Imperial Guards has arrived.

516
00:37:04,560 --> 00:37:06,280
Shen Du, the Great Chief of the Imperial Guards.

517
00:37:06,280 --> 00:37:08,040
Greetings to you, Grand Empress Dowager.

518
00:37:08,040 --> 00:37:10,960
May you live for long.

519
00:37:10,960 --> 00:37:12,960
Minister Shen,

520
00:37:12,960 --> 00:37:16,480
the case of the Liang family has yet to be solved.

521
00:37:16,480 --> 00:37:19,380
Maybe you should give me an explanation.

522
00:37:19,380 --> 00:37:22,800
Grand Empress Dowager, the murder case of the Liang family is not an isolated incident.

523
00:37:22,800 --> 00:37:25,700
But it's related to multiple bodies dug up in succession at Ximing Temple

524
00:37:25,700 --> 00:37:27,120
and committed by the same murderer.

525
00:37:27,120 --> 00:37:30,040
Based on the evidence, the Imperial Guards have sped up solving the cases.

526
00:37:30,040 --> 00:37:33,180
The case of the Liang Mansion involves important court officials.

527
00:37:33,180 --> 00:37:36,280
And Ximing Temple is even a place for devout Buddhist practice and worship.

528
00:37:36,280 --> 00:37:37,940
Now with the case unresolved,

529
00:37:37,940 --> 00:37:42,760
an offensive nursery rhyme has become popular in the city.

530
00:37:44,960 --> 00:37:47,160
Tell me about it.

531
00:37:47,160 --> 00:37:52,730
Then I will recite this nursery rhyme to Your Majesty.

532
00:37:54,480 --> 00:37:58,340
"Ruthless people, merciless Buddha,

533
00:37:58,340 --> 00:38:00,920
under the sovereign, the order is in chaos.

534
00:38:00,920 --> 00:38:04,400
Merciless Buddha hides sin."

535
00:38:04,400 --> 00:38:05,840
Impudent!

536
00:38:05,840 --> 00:38:07,280
Grand Empress Dowager, please calm down.

537
00:38:07,280 --> 00:38:09,530
I believe that the spread of this nursery rhyme

538
00:38:09,530 --> 00:38:11,980
is all because the murder case at Ximing Temple remains unresolved.

539
00:38:11,980 --> 00:38:14,280
If the Imperial Guards cannot find the murderer,

540
00:38:14,280 --> 00:38:18,000
then we might as well have an exorcism.

541
00:38:18,000 --> 00:38:20,570
Grand Empress Dowager, admired by all.

542
00:38:20,570 --> 00:38:23,040
Don't mind these reckless words.

543
00:38:30,760 --> 00:38:34,300
Great Chief Shen, you forgot this.

544
00:38:46,360 --> 00:38:48,680
The Imperial Guards suddenly arrived to arrest me,

545
00:38:48,680 --> 00:38:52,900
and I was in the process of sorting out the case, wanting to present it to Your Majesty.

546
00:39:07,200 --> 00:39:10,400
A great line: "In the peaceful world, only Buddha's heart prevails.

547
00:39:10,400 --> 00:39:13,880
Evil thoughts through countless calamities shall never survive.

548
00:39:13,880 --> 00:39:17,320
Unraveling the threads to cleanse the grievances.

549
00:39:17,320 --> 00:39:21,080
With keen insight, the world is at peace."

550
00:39:21,840 --> 00:39:23,040
Very well.

551
00:39:23,040 --> 00:39:29,420
Now that you've gotten clues about the Liang family and Ximing Temple,

552
00:39:29,420 --> 00:39:31,700
then let's proceed.

553
00:39:32,600 --> 00:39:35,580
Understood.

554
00:39:37,560 --> 00:39:39,280
Minister Shen,

555
00:39:39,280 --> 00:39:42,080
you also mentioned in your memorial

556
00:39:42,080 --> 00:39:45,040
there is an inside story on the Ming Hall self-immolation case.

557
00:39:45,040 --> 00:39:49,240
The self-immolator did not do it to vent dissatisfaction,

558
00:39:49,240 --> 00:39:54,860
but a desperate act to express his determination to me through death.

559
00:39:55,480 --> 00:39:56,720
Is that true?

560
00:39:56,720 --> 00:40:00,540
I am reviewing it and will report as soon as possible.

561
00:40:01,160 --> 00:40:02,720
Grand Empress Dowager.

562
00:40:02,720 --> 00:40:04,440
All right.

563
00:40:04,440 --> 00:40:08,360
You two are both my right-hand men.

564
00:40:08,360 --> 00:40:10,640
Each with your own merits.

565
00:40:12,120 --> 00:40:18,020
Enough for today, you may all leave now.

566
00:40:25,760 --> 00:40:27,980
Minister Shen.

567
00:40:29,400 --> 00:40:31,600
Please stay.

568
00:40:31,600 --> 00:40:35,240
I have another matter

569
00:40:35,240 --> 00:40:39,740
for you to attend to immediately.

570
00:40:49,520 --> 00:40:52,240
I shall obey your command.

571
00:40:59,240 --> 00:41:01,340
Great Chief Shen.

572
00:41:05,920 --> 00:41:11,540
Today, in front of the Grand Empress Dowager, you remained composed and eloquent.

573
00:41:11,540 --> 00:41:13,120
Truly amazing.

574
00:41:13,120 --> 00:41:14,920
Vice Minister Lai, you flatter me.

575
00:41:14,920 --> 00:41:17,760
I was merely stating the facts.

576
00:41:21,860 --> 00:41:27,550
People say the Imperial Guards are the Grand Empress Dowager's eyes.

577
00:41:27,550 --> 00:41:32,140
But don't look in the wrong direction.

578
00:41:32,140 --> 00:41:35,360
All we do is within our duties,

579
00:41:35,360 --> 00:41:38,840
unlike the Imperial Inspectorate, with fangs bared, tearing about everywhere.

580
00:41:38,840 --> 00:41:43,060
If it were someone else, they would probably be at their wits' end.

581
00:41:46,860 --> 00:41:50,360
Then I hope you can solve the case soon.

582
00:41:53,120 --> 00:41:55,400
There are many people...

583
00:41:56,520 --> 00:41:58,720
watching you.
