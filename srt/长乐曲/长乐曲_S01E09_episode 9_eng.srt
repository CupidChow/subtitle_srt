 'Go Ahead Fearlessly' - Liu Yuning 

3
00:00:31,980 --> 00:00:34,822
♫  Grudges and karma, right and wrong  ♫

4
00:00:34,822 --> 00:00:38,220
♫  The past hides blood and tears  ♫

5
00:00:38,220 --> 00:00:40,689
♫  It is hard to catch up after years of separation  ♫

6
00:00:40,689 --> 00:00:44,464
♫  The truth cannot be fully revealed  ♫

7
00:00:44,464 --> 00:00:47,599
♫  Fate is full of twists and turns  ♫

8
00:00:47,599 --> 00:00:50,764
♫  Life and death, fortune and misfortune go hand in hand  ♫

9
00:00:50,764 --> 00:00:55,900
♫  Obsession is hard to get rid of, keeping the truth 
 and getting rid of the lies, let the wind blow  ♫

10
00:00:55,900 --> 00:01:02,172
♫  Tossed about by the wind and rain, I will never regret it, 
 I will accompany you for my whole life  ♫

11
00:01:02,172 --> 00:01:08,480
♫  At least you share my joy and sorrow  ♫

12
00:01:08,480 --> 00:01:14,759
♫  Unravelling fate, fearlessly, a dream returns  ♫

13
00:01:14,759 --> 00:01:21,172
♫  The mountains and rivers are bright and beautiful, 
 holding hands, together we return  ♫

14
00:01:21,172 --> 00:01:28,816
♫  In this life, my heart returns untainted of dust and ash  ♫

15
00:01:28,816 --> 00:01:37,150
   

16
00:01:37,150 --> 00:01:40,285
   

17
00:01:43,160 --> 00:01:46,380
How did you get all these injuries?

18
00:01:51,840 --> 00:01:54,060
I fell by accident.

19
00:01:56,680 --> 00:01:59,940
That means Great Chief has been quite careless.

20
00:02:02,080 --> 00:02:06,300
What I mean is, he didn't take good care of you.

21
00:02:12,040 --> 00:02:16,600
Let me tell you. Typically, women who are abused at home all say that. Right?

22
00:02:16,600 --> 00:02:18,796
 - Right. 
 - Right. 

23
00:02:22,900 --> 00:02:24,480
My Lord!

24
00:02:24,480 --> 00:02:25,920
What happened to you?

25
00:02:25,920 --> 00:02:27,360
Move, move, move aside.

26
00:02:27,360 --> 00:02:30,080
Quick, take a seat. Slow down.

27
00:02:30,080 --> 00:02:31,680
How did this happen?

28
00:02:31,680 --> 00:02:34,320
Where did you get hurt? Slow down.

29
00:02:34,320 --> 00:02:36,840
Where did you get this injury?

30
00:02:39,860 --> 00:02:41,680
How did this happen?

31
00:02:41,680 --> 00:02:45,100
I fell by accident, I fell.

32
00:02:46,440 --> 00:02:48,640
You fell as well?

33
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:54,560
Jiang the Stickler. Jiang the Stickler.

34
00:02:55,860 --> 00:02:57,720
I just wanted to watch a play.

35
00:02:57,720 --> 00:03:01,620
The opera was only halfway through and my father dragged me back.

36
00:03:01,620 --> 00:03:04,140
It must have been that Jiang the Stickler.

37
00:03:05,480 --> 00:03:09,940
Well, is it Old Wu who sent Jiang the Stickler to torment me?

38
00:03:10,800 --> 00:03:13,640
How on earth did I offend him?

39
00:03:18,140 --> 00:03:21,380
My father said there is no problem that a gold ingot can't solve.

40
00:03:21,380 --> 00:03:24,480
If one ingot isn't enough, use two.

41
00:03:26,080 --> 00:03:30,240
Chuichui, I really can't help you with this.

42
00:03:30,240 --> 00:03:34,380
I have an appointment with Chi today at the Guangyue Restaurant.

43
00:03:34,380 --> 00:03:37,640
-  I must go. 
 - You fickle creature!

44
00:03:39,380 --> 00:03:41,510
Sixth Miss.

45
00:03:41,510 --> 00:03:45,700
Your head injury can be said to be from a bump.

46
00:03:45,700 --> 00:03:48,920
But how did your leg get injured?

47
00:03:48,920 --> 00:03:52,220
- It wasn't the White Ghost bullying you, was it? 
 - No.

48
00:03:52,720 --> 00:03:55,020
I'm going.

49
00:03:57,900 --> 00:04:00,420
Boss, a pancake, please.

50
00:04:10,320 --> 00:04:12,660
The weather is really nice today.

51
00:04:13,640 --> 00:04:15,720
Here, your pancake.

52
00:04:15,720 --> 00:04:18,659
- Thanks, put it on my tab. 
 - Okay.

53
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:31,060
Registrar Lu.

54
00:04:45,640 --> 00:04:47,980
Jiang the Stickler, just speak clearly.

55
00:04:47,980 --> 00:04:50,420
How much do you really want?

56
00:04:55,680 --> 00:04:57,420
What you've given...

57
00:04:59,410 --> 00:05:01,410
is plenty.

58
00:05:07,600 --> 00:05:10,060
 Come on up. 

59
00:05:11,120 --> 00:05:12,340
 Look over there. 

60
00:05:12,340 --> 00:05:13,580
 Chuichui. 

61
00:05:13,580 --> 00:05:16,180
 Father, give me an ingot of gold. 

62
00:05:16,180 --> 00:05:19,820
    
  Chuichui, if you buy this kind of poor boy, how can he be worth gold? 

63
00:05:19,820 --> 00:05:23,560
 A string of coins is sufficient. Here. 

64
00:05:23,560 --> 00:05:26,900
 No, I want an ingot of gold. 

65
00:05:28,240 --> 00:05:32,140
 Little Miss, from now on I am your man. 

66
00:05:32,140 --> 00:05:34,600
 No need, I have enough servants at home. 

67
00:05:34,600 --> 00:05:37,400
 How can a man spend his whole life serving others? 

68
00:05:37,400 --> 00:05:40,800
 He must go do more meaningful things and protect more people. 

69
00:05:40,800 --> 00:05:42,504
 Let's go. 

70
00:06:23,280 --> 00:06:28,540
 Chi, you and I make friends through letters, corresponding for a long time in the boudoir. 

71
00:06:28,540 --> 00:06:30,280
 Finally, we're going to meet today. 

72
00:06:30,280 --> 00:06:32,240
 I'm actually feeling a bit nervous. 

73
00:06:32,240 --> 00:06:36,760
 I wonder what kind of beautiful lady you are. 

74
00:06:38,760 --> 00:06:40,840
Miss, Academician Yan has suddenly fallen critically ill.

75
00:06:40,840 --> 00:06:43,320
Please hurry back to the mansion to see.

76
00:07:08,880 --> 00:07:11,700
 My father is critically ill. Postpone our meeting to another time. 

77
00:07:11,700 --> 00:07:13,620
 Hoping for your understanding. 

78
00:07:14,098 --> 00:07:16,450
   

79
00:07:18,400 --> 00:07:20,090
Father.

80
00:07:20,960 --> 00:07:23,120
Father, how are you?

81
00:07:31,680 --> 00:07:37,740
Now, it's really not easy for me to see you.

82
00:07:37,740 --> 00:07:41,820
If I wish to hear you speak a few words of truth,

83
00:07:41,820 --> 00:07:45,680
that's even harder than reaching the heavens.

84
00:07:51,880 --> 00:07:53,744
I dare not.

85
00:07:55,100 --> 00:07:57,040
Dare not?

86
00:07:59,300 --> 00:08:03,540
You clearly know why I made you marry into the Shen Mansion.

87
00:08:03,540 --> 00:08:10,160
Yet you report to me every day the trivial things like Shen Du's meals.

88
00:08:10,160 --> 00:08:14,120
Prime Minister Zhang, I know since entering the Shen Mansion,

89
00:08:14,120 --> 00:08:18,280
I must share your worries and keep inquiring about Shen Du's information.

90
00:08:18,280 --> 00:08:22,000
But in the Shen Mansion, I'm just a secluded lady.

91
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:25,420
What can be found out is nothing more than trifles about three meals.

92
00:08:25,420 --> 00:08:28,100
For espionage information, details are important.

93
00:08:28,100 --> 00:08:29,440
I fear omitting anything.

94
00:08:29,440 --> 00:08:31,460
So I had to report everything regardless of importance.

95
00:08:31,460 --> 00:08:34,440
If you still feel it is not enough, for the confidential report next month,

96
00:08:34,440 --> 00:08:37,259
I will report the daily routines, bathing, and conjugal circumstances—

97
00:08:37,259 --> 00:08:38,559
Stop talking.

98
00:08:38,559 --> 00:08:41,280
As a young lady, how can you speak such words?

99
00:08:41,280 --> 00:08:46,020
Academician Yan, this is the good daughter you have raised.

100
00:08:46,020 --> 00:08:48,820
Prime Minister Zhang, please forgive me. Please forgive me.

101
00:08:48,820 --> 00:08:50,500
It is my fault for not teaching my daughter properly.

102
00:08:50,500 --> 00:08:53,360
I have not taught my daughter properly.

103
00:08:53,360 --> 00:08:56,860
I am incompetent and failed to find useful intelligence.

104
00:08:56,860 --> 00:09:00,440
Please don't displace anger onto my father.

105
00:09:08,580 --> 00:09:10,760
Sixth Miss,

106
00:09:10,760 --> 00:09:16,660
I know once a girl is married, her husband is her heaven.

107
00:09:16,660 --> 00:09:19,720
In her eyes and in her heart, it's all about the one beside her.

108
00:09:19,720 --> 00:09:23,360
Even if she has been wronged, she must swallow it herself.

109
00:09:23,360 --> 00:09:29,020
But what a girl fears most is that her pillow companion is a jackal from Zhongshan.

110
00:09:29,020 --> 00:09:33,040
The case of Shen Mansion caused a sensation throughout the court and the country back then.

111
00:09:33,040 --> 00:09:34,720
You were little at that time.

112
00:09:34,720 --> 00:09:37,240
But you should have heard of it.

113
00:09:37,240 --> 00:09:42,860
Do you know who dealt the final blow to the Shen family?

114
00:09:48,680 --> 00:09:51,440
It was Shen Du.

115
00:10:07,100 --> 00:10:09,100
Great Chief, after conducting an investigation, I found

116
00:10:09,100 --> 00:10:11,540
for the over ten-year-old case that had been endorsed by the Grand Empress Dowager,

117
00:10:11,540 --> 00:10:14,040
the archives of evidence are all kept at the Secretariat of Lintai.

118
00:10:14,040 --> 00:10:15,280
Lintai?

119
00:10:15,280 --> 00:10:17,240
But the Secretariat has entrenched and interwoven power.

120
00:10:17,240 --> 00:10:18,960
Lintai has always been heavily guarded.

121
00:10:18,960 --> 00:10:21,620
Even the imperial guards may not approach without a reason.

122
00:10:21,620 --> 00:10:23,200
It doesn't matter.

123
00:10:23,200 --> 00:10:26,300
As long as the item is there, there will naturally be a way to get it.

124
00:10:26,300 --> 00:10:27,980
Yes.

125
00:10:27,980 --> 00:10:31,920
Moreover, Madam returned to Yan Mansion tonight.

126
00:10:31,920 --> 00:10:35,340
However, coincidentally, Prime Minister Zhang also went to Yan Mansion tonight.

127
00:10:35,340 --> 00:10:37,160
He did not take the Prime Minister's carriage.

128
00:10:37,160 --> 00:10:39,480
Instead, he took the usual sedan chair.

129
00:10:47,060 --> 00:10:49,080
Understood.

130
00:10:49,080 --> 00:10:51,540
I will wait outside the door.

131
00:10:57,159 --> 00:11:00,690
   

132
00:11:26,798 --> 00:11:29,988
♫  Heart burned, a withered body, a lifetime of solitude  ♫

♫  Heart burned, a withered body, a lifetime of solitude  ♫

 I denounce. 

135
00:11:36,300 --> 00:11:39,560
 I, Shen Du, the son of the criminal official Shen Bingzhu, 

136
00:11:39,560 --> 00:11:46,100
 denounce my father for colluding with foreign lands and conspiring with the rebel army. 

137
00:11:47,120 --> 00:11:49,300
 I denounce.

 I, Shen Du, the son of the criminal official Shen Bingzhu,

 denounce my father for colluding with foreign lands and conspiring with the rebel army.

 I denounce. 

141

 I, Shen Du, the son of the criminal official Shen Bingzhu, 

142

 denounce my father for colluding with foreign lands and conspiring with the rebel army.

151
00:12:45,780 --> 00:12:49,380
 Great Chief, why are you mocking me? 

152
00:12:49,380 --> 00:12:52,020
 I did try to murder my own child. 

153
00:12:52,020 --> 00:12:55,240
 But what about you? You reported your own father. 

154
00:12:55,240 --> 00:12:58,300
 We are clearly the same type of people. 

155

♫  Who can save me from grudges and karma?  ♫

156
00:13:02,820 --> 00:13:06,240
 Father, for the path I chose back then, 

157
00:13:06,240 --> 00:13:08,240
 I had no choice. 

158
00:13:08,800 --> 00:13:13,020
 But now as long I can successfully enter Lintai, 

159
00:13:13,020 --> 00:13:16,040
 I will be able to obtain the correspondence of colluding with the enemy that year. 

160
00:13:16,040 --> 00:13:18,460
 After it is proved to be forged, 

161
00:13:18,460 --> 00:13:22,364
 there will be one less piece of evidence against my father's crimes. 

162
00:13:22,364 --> 00:13:29,084
♫  Wishing to disappear in the hustle and bustle with you  ♫

163
00:14:43,020 --> 00:14:46,080
 In the case of the Shen Mansion back then, although the evidence was conclusive, 

164
00:14:46,080 --> 00:14:49,520
 Minister Shen nevertheless proclaimed his innocence and refused to sign the confession. 

165
00:14:49,520 --> 00:14:53,020
 Despite enduring torture, he never admitted guilt until his death. 

166
00:14:53,020 --> 00:14:54,980
 The case was ultimately closed with just physical evidence. 

167
00:14:54,980 --> 00:14:57,780
 There were no confessions. But who could have expected it? 

168
00:14:57,780 --> 00:15:00,180
 After many years, the young emperor ascended to the throne. 

169
00:15:00,180 --> 00:15:02,520
 The Grand Empress Dowager presided over the court. 

170
00:15:02,520 --> 00:15:05,840
 Your beloved husband Shen Du, in order to escape his criminal record and climb to a high position, 

171
00:15:05,840 --> 00:15:07,840
 did not hesitate to write a confession. 

172
00:15:07,840 --> 00:15:11,160
 On behalf of his father, Minister Shen, he admitted the crimes 

173
00:15:11,160 --> 00:15:14,240
 one by one. 

174
00:15:16,600 --> 00:15:18,416
Who is there?

175
00:15:25,820 --> 00:15:27,680
 It's me. 

176
00:15:27,680 --> 00:15:29,440
 Your husband. 

177
00:15:29,440 --> 00:15:31,920
 What are you doing here? 

178
00:15:31,920 --> 00:15:34,040
 Why are you covered in blood? 

179
00:15:34,040 --> 00:15:38,260
 My wife, do you want to know whose blood this is? 

180
00:15:38,260 --> 00:15:41,920
 It's the blood of the dozen or so people in the Yan family, old and young. 

181
00:15:41,920 --> 00:15:43,960
 You deserve it... 

182
00:15:45,400 --> 00:15:49,020
 for being a spy. 

183
00:15:55,560 --> 00:15:59,100
 Are you truly such a cold-blooded and heartless person? 

184
00:16:48,840 --> 00:16:51,104
The porridge is not bad.

185
00:16:52,100 --> 00:16:53,928
Too sweet.

186
00:17:08,540 --> 00:17:10,880
The side dish is quite crisp.

187
00:17:13,940 --> 00:17:16,096
Too salty.

188
00:17:19,240 --> 00:17:21,240
I love to have sweet porridge with salty dishes.

189
00:17:21,240 --> 00:17:23,700
Uncle Zhong, from now on, for breakfast,

190
00:17:23,700 --> 00:17:26,359
prepare salty porridge with sweet desserts.

191
00:17:27,180 --> 00:17:29,740
Shen Du, what do you mean?

192
00:17:33,960 --> 00:17:35,940
I don't mean anything.

193
00:17:35,940 --> 00:17:40,240
Shen Du, are you really such a person?

194
00:17:41,080 --> 00:17:43,940
Are you truly such a person?

195
00:17:43,940 --> 00:17:45,580
So what if I am?

196
00:17:45,580 --> 00:17:47,660
So what if I'm not?

197
00:17:49,140 --> 00:17:53,520
Yan Xing, I, Shen Du, am exactly this kind of person.

198
00:18:08,620 --> 00:18:12,300
Great Chief, I truly feel injustice on your behalf.

199
00:18:12,300 --> 00:18:15,180
The fact that that woman is not content is one thing. But she even turns out to be a fierce and evil woman.

200
00:18:15,180 --> 00:18:17,220
In the beginning, she at least pretended a bit.

201
00:18:17,220 --> 00:18:20,300
In just a few days, her true nature has been revealed.

202
00:18:21,720 --> 00:18:25,240
 You have your orders to obey. I also have my duties to fulfill. 

203
00:18:25,240 --> 00:18:27,170
 At least, we need to keep up appearances. 

204
00:18:27,170 --> 00:18:29,700
 But we won't get serious, rest assured. 

205
00:18:29,700 --> 00:18:32,020
Jing Lin.

206
00:18:32,020 --> 00:18:35,600
Tell me. Is it that Madam Shen was beaten by her husband

207
00:18:35,600 --> 00:18:37,920
or is it that the White Ghost met a female demon

208
00:18:37,920 --> 00:18:41,660
who could excite the ladies of Xiang'an City even more...

209
00:18:43,520 --> 00:18:47,340
and make the likes of Prime Minister Zhang feel that there's an opportunity to exploit it?

210
00:18:48,280 --> 00:18:50,700
Several days have passed since the wedding day.

211
00:18:50,700 --> 00:18:53,720
It must provide some fodder for gossip.

212
00:18:58,800 --> 00:19:00,880
You mean it's intentional to let those with ulterior motives

213
00:19:00,880 --> 00:19:04,220
believe that the Shen Mansion is not at peace and thereby lower their guard.

214
00:19:05,420 --> 00:19:07,400
You're not stupid.

215
00:19:08,560 --> 00:19:12,140
So the quarrel you had today was deliberate?

216
00:19:12,860 --> 00:19:14,800
Clever indeed.

217
00:19:14,800 --> 00:19:19,380
The injuries on Madam were also inflicted by design?

218
00:19:32,680 --> 00:19:35,440
Hongwen School has always recruited individuals of high status.

219
00:19:35,440 --> 00:19:37,640
This time, the examination does not require recommendation letters

220
00:19:37,640 --> 00:19:39,840
and there's no investigation into one's family background.

221
00:19:39,840 --> 00:19:42,400
So how will character be assessed?

222
00:19:42,400 --> 00:19:44,440
It will be a contest of who writes the best essay.

223
00:19:44,440 --> 00:19:47,540
For those rural louts, as long as they're willing to bury themselves in hard study,

224
00:19:47,540 --> 00:19:49,200
hanging their heads from beams and stabbing their thighs with awls,

225
00:19:49,200 --> 00:19:51,140
they might just win the big prize and enter the school.

226
00:19:51,140 --> 00:19:53,340
I don't want to be their classmate.

227
00:19:53,340 --> 00:19:57,060
Your Majesty, the examination for the Hongwen School is approaching.

228
00:19:57,060 --> 00:20:00,660
This is the first time family backgrounds are not being scrutinized.

229
00:20:00,660 --> 00:20:05,100
Scholars from humble backgrounds who are capable can all compete fairly.

230
00:20:05,100 --> 00:20:06,920
The significance is extraordinary.

231
00:20:06,920 --> 00:20:12,460
Moreover, this time it's especially permitted for students from Xichen and Nanlang to take the exam.

232
00:20:12,460 --> 00:20:16,160
Therefore, every single detail of this examination

233
00:20:16,160 --> 00:20:17,760
must not be taken lightly.

234
00:20:17,760 --> 00:20:22,040
Indeed. What Prime Minister Zhang says is very true.

235
00:20:22,040 --> 00:20:25,160
This examination is unprecedented.

236
00:20:25,160 --> 00:20:28,980
It will affect the face of Great Cang.

237
00:20:28,980 --> 00:20:32,180
Prime Minister Zhang, who do you think

238
00:20:32,180 --> 00:20:36,000
is worthy of this important responsibility?

239
00:20:37,380 --> 00:20:40,520
Prince Xian has made notable contributions to the disaster relief.

240
00:20:40,520 --> 00:20:43,160
Along the way, the common people sang praises of his integrity.

241
00:20:43,160 --> 00:20:47,140
I think perhaps this time we should let His Highness

242
00:20:47,140 --> 00:20:49,800
take charge of the imperial examination.

243
00:20:55,820 --> 00:20:58,840
Everyone knows that Prince Xian and Prime Minister Zhang value the nobility.

244
00:20:58,840 --> 00:21:00,440
If you were to be in charge,

245
00:21:00,440 --> 00:21:04,520
wouldn't there no longer be the slightest chance for the poor scholars throughout the land?

246
00:21:07,040 --> 00:21:08,720
You have misunderstood.

247
00:21:08,720 --> 00:21:13,560
Princess of Valor, who do you think would be more suitable?

248
00:21:13,560 --> 00:21:18,580
I think it might be better to let Shen Du take charge.

249
00:21:19,200 --> 00:21:22,840
Since when has the Princess of Valor held Great Chief Shen in such high esteem?

250
00:21:22,840 --> 00:21:25,160
To actually have the Imperial Guards, who are in charge of martial positions,

251
00:21:25,160 --> 00:21:27,960
oversee the civil service examination.

252
00:21:27,960 --> 00:21:30,220
Vice Minister Lai, your words are incorrect.

253
00:21:30,220 --> 00:21:33,440
Choosing the virtuous and promoting the capable is all in service of the Grand Empress Dowager.

254
00:21:33,440 --> 00:21:35,720
Although the Hongwen School examinations are written tests,

255
00:21:35,720 --> 00:21:38,340
the relevant arrangements involve more than just literary flourish,

256
00:21:38,340 --> 00:21:40,140
but also require a firm hand to manage.

257
00:21:40,140 --> 00:21:42,300
The Imperial Guards have always been meticulous in their work.

258
00:21:42,300 --> 00:21:44,400
They will surely make proper arrangements.

259
00:21:44,400 --> 00:21:48,980
The Imperial Guards are willing to share the worries of Your Majesty and give it our best effort.

260
00:21:48,980 --> 00:21:54,240
Your Majesty, Great Chief Shen spends all day arresting people and handling cases,

261
00:21:54,240 --> 00:21:56,560
causing everyone to be alarmed.

262
00:21:56,560 --> 00:22:00,240
Moreover, the Shen Mansion's inner quarters are in constant turmoil.

263
00:22:00,240 --> 00:22:02,280
He lacks the ability to manage his family.

264
00:22:02,280 --> 00:22:05,140
If we let Shen Du take charge of this imperial examination,

265
00:22:05,140 --> 00:22:10,800
it really is a disgrace to scholars, Your Majesty.

266
00:22:10,800 --> 00:22:13,160
About the matters in my mansion,

267
00:22:13,700 --> 00:22:16,400
Prime Minister Zhang is very clear.

268
00:22:17,340 --> 00:22:20,120
All right. About this matter,

269
00:22:20,120 --> 00:22:23,100
let me think about it.

270
00:22:25,840 --> 00:22:28,700
- I'll take my leave. 
 - I'll take my leave.

271
00:22:35,104 --> 00:22:36,721
   

272
00:23:04,900 --> 00:23:06,500
Who is it?

273
00:23:08,560 --> 00:23:11,100
Third Sister? Please get up.

274
00:23:11,100 --> 00:23:12,940
Sixth Miss.

275
00:23:12,940 --> 00:23:15,000
It's me who has wronged you.

276
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:18,500
Third Sister, why have you come back? Where is Young Master Han?

277
00:23:18,500 --> 00:23:21,000
It was you who suffered on behalf of me.

278
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:24,600
I discussed it with him. We might as well go home together and ask for forgiveness.

279
00:23:24,600 --> 00:23:28,300
But-But I dare not go home.

280
00:23:29,640 --> 00:23:34,080
I just have to hide outside the Shen Mansion.

281
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:37,200
I'm sorry.

282
00:23:37,200 --> 00:23:39,480
Third Sister, don't blame yourself.

283
00:23:39,480 --> 00:23:42,600
Let's go home first. We can talk about any issues when we get home.

284
00:23:42,600 --> 00:23:44,320
    
 Right, over there.

285
00:23:44,320 --> 00:23:46,340
Come on, below it.

286
00:23:46,340 --> 00:23:49,600
Right. Good.

287
00:23:49,600 --> 00:23:53,000
Come down quickly. Third Miss and Sixth Miss have returned.

288
00:23:53,740 --> 00:23:57,800
My Lord! Madam! Third Miss and Sixth Miss have returned.

289
00:23:57,800 --> 00:24:01,300
My Lord! Madam! Third Miss and Sixth Miss have returned.

290
00:24:01,300 --> 00:24:03,600
My Lord! Madam!

291
00:24:04,340 --> 00:24:07,140
- Third Miss has returned? 
 - Yes, Third Miss and Sixth Miss have returned.

292
00:24:07,140 --> 00:24:09,600
- Mother! 
 - Caiwei!

293
00:24:09,600 --> 00:24:12,540
Caiwei, you're finally back. You had me so worried.

294
00:24:12,540 --> 00:24:14,310
- Daughter. 
 - Mother.

295
00:24:14,310 --> 00:24:16,380
My poor, unfortunate sixth daughter!

296
00:24:16,380 --> 00:24:18,280
So the rumors outside are true.

297
00:24:18,280 --> 00:24:21,240
- That White Ghost really dared to hit you? 
 - No, Mother.

298
00:24:21,240 --> 00:24:24,160
With all your good intentions, you took the risk to go to the Palace of Death for someone else.

299
00:24:24,160 --> 00:24:25,720
They are ungrateful.

300
00:24:25,720 --> 00:24:27,840
Enjoying good food, and mother and daughter reuniting.

301
00:24:27,840 --> 00:24:30,200
Only my poor sixth daughter

302
00:24:30,200 --> 00:24:32,920
was threatened and tormented by that White Ghost.

303
00:24:32,920 --> 00:24:36,520
- You were beaten up! 
 - Mother, stop it!

304
00:24:36,520 --> 00:24:38,340
It didn't happen.

305
00:24:38,340 --> 00:24:40,440
- It's all because— 
 - Sixth Miss,

306
00:24:41,220 --> 00:24:44,560
I was too selfish, thinking only of myself.

307
00:24:44,560 --> 00:24:49,340
Today, outside the Shen Mansion, I heard them say you were insulted by that White Ghost.

308
00:24:49,340 --> 00:24:51,680
I'm deeply pained.

309
00:24:51,680 --> 00:24:55,520
That White Ghost insulted you?

310
00:24:55,520 --> 00:24:58,340
It should be a mutual exchange of insults.

311
00:24:58,340 --> 00:25:01,810
If such a thing happens again next time, I will put it all on the line.

312
00:25:01,810 --> 00:25:04,500
- We'll curse him together. 
 - Mother, it really didn't happen.

313
00:25:04,500 --> 00:25:06,920
Everyone is here.

314
00:25:06,920 --> 00:25:09,140
Stop.

315
00:25:09,140 --> 00:25:12,360
    

316
00:25:14,560 --> 00:25:20,160
Sixth Sister, I heard that you were beaten by that White Ghost.

317
00:25:20,160 --> 00:25:23,840
Isn't it because you're too foolish and are unable to serve your husband?

318
00:25:23,840 --> 00:25:28,000
- You have a foul temper. I tell you, you're… 
 - You!

319
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:33,220
- Third Sister, is it really you? Didn't you elope with someone? 
 - Be quiet.

320
00:25:33,220 --> 00:25:37,320
Reeking of alcohol. Not returning all night. What kind of state are you in?

321
00:25:37,320 --> 00:25:39,580
- Old Master! 
 - What kind of propriety?

322
00:25:39,580 --> 00:25:41,520
- Old Master! 
 - How improper!

323
00:25:41,520 --> 00:25:42,960
Old Master!

324
00:25:42,960 --> 00:25:44,660
Go back to your room.

325
00:25:44,660 --> 00:25:46,680
You can't do that.

326
00:25:46,680 --> 00:25:49,160
Father, I remember it.

327
00:25:49,160 --> 00:25:51,360
On my way back just now,

328
00:25:51,360 --> 00:25:53,720
it seemed like I saw that White Ghost

329
00:25:53,720 --> 00:25:56,100
with a squad of imperial guards charging towards our home.

330
00:25:56,100 --> 00:25:58,700
I don't know who they want to capture.

331
00:26:00,240 --> 00:26:03,350
    

332
00:26:16,910 --> 00:26:18,100
    

333
00:26:18,100 --> 00:26:20,560
Greetings, Great Chief.

334
00:26:31,290 --> 00:26:33,870
   

335
00:26:34,920 --> 00:26:36,950
Great Chief.

336
00:27:01,960 --> 00:27:05,480
Shen Du, all of this is my fault.

337
00:27:05,480 --> 00:27:07,240
It has nothing to do with Sixth Miss.

338
00:27:07,240 --> 00:27:09,200
If there's anything, let it all come at me.

339
00:27:09,200 --> 00:27:11,056
Who are you?

340
00:27:14,440 --> 00:27:16,800
Yan Caiwei.

341
00:27:16,800 --> 00:27:18,700
Take her away.

342
00:27:20,680 --> 00:27:23,300
Great Chief, I am well aware

343
00:27:23,300 --> 00:27:27,800
the marriage between the Shen and Yan families displeased you.

344
00:27:27,800 --> 00:27:30,000
I feel guilty about it.

345
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:33,160
But the marriage between you and Sixth Miss has already taken place.

346
00:27:33,160 --> 00:27:40,000
I hope you will consider the marriage and show leniency, Great Chief.

347
00:27:45,520 --> 00:27:48,340
Take away Yan Xing as well.

348
00:27:49,440 --> 00:27:51,800
Take both people away? Great Chief!

349
00:27:51,800 --> 00:27:55,600
- You can't do that, Great Chief! 
 - Don't move.

350
00:27:55,600 --> 00:27:57,180
I, Yan Mojie, am here.

351
00:27:57,180 --> 00:27:59,360
Nobody is allowed to touch my Yan family members.

352
00:27:59,360 --> 00:28:03,080
White Ghost, do you really think you belong to the Palace of Death?

353
00:28:03,080 --> 00:28:05,520
You can take any one's soul you want to take.

354
00:28:05,520 --> 00:28:09,420
- Is there no law and order anymore? 
 - You shut up.

355
00:28:09,420 --> 00:28:12,820
This guy obstructed official duties.

356
00:28:16,180 --> 00:28:18,600
- Take him away together. 
 - Great Chief! 
 - Great Chief!

357
00:28:18,600 --> 00:28:20,280
Please have mercy, Great Chief!

358
00:28:20,280 --> 00:28:22,420
You can't do that, Great Chief!

359
00:28:22,420 --> 00:28:24,820
Great Chief!

360
00:28:24,820 --> 00:28:28,360
Please have mercy, Great Chief!

361
00:28:28,360 --> 00:28:31,800
- Caiwei! Sixth Miss! 
 - Great Chief!

362
00:28:31,800 --> 00:28:35,600
You can't do that, Great Chief!

363
00:28:47,400 --> 00:28:49,164
Great Chief.

364
00:28:52,600 --> 00:28:56,400
Shen Du, what on earth do you want to do?

365
00:28:56,400 --> 00:29:00,000
Yan Caiwei, where is Han Shiyuan?

366
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:01,960
I…

367
00:29:01,960 --> 00:29:04,200
I don't know.

368
00:29:04,200 --> 00:29:06,520
He is now a murder suspect.

369
00:29:06,520 --> 00:29:08,780
Are you sure you want to cover for him?

370
00:29:08,780 --> 00:29:10,896
- What? 
 - What?

371
00:29:15,880 --> 00:29:18,720
Madam, your absence from the Ministry of Justice today has left you uninformed.

372
00:29:18,720 --> 00:29:21,580
In a cornered well of the Hongwen School, the body of a scholar was found.

373
00:29:21,580 --> 00:29:24,420
Since the case involved a scholar from the Hongwen School, it alarmed the Grand Empress Dowager.

374
00:29:24,420 --> 00:29:26,320
The Grand Empress Dowager instructed that the Imperial Guards were to handle the investigation.

375
00:29:26,320 --> 00:29:29,800
Currently, the prime suspect is Han Shiyuan.

376
00:29:29,800 --> 00:29:33,480
Impossible. He would never commit murder.

377
00:29:34,460 --> 00:29:37,640
Do you think Han Shiyuan and you were eloping for love?

378
00:29:37,640 --> 00:29:39,480
But the evidence shows

379
00:29:39,480 --> 00:29:42,640
that he is a murderer, fleeing from his crime.

380
00:29:42,640 --> 00:29:44,600
How could it be?

381
00:29:44,600 --> 00:29:46,240
Impossible.

382
00:29:46,240 --> 00:29:50,880
Third Sister, do you really not know where Han Shiyuan is?

383
00:29:50,880 --> 00:29:54,760
He must show himself to prove his innocence.

384
00:29:57,020 --> 00:30:00,220
As soon as we returned to Xiang'an, he disappeared.

385
00:30:00,220 --> 00:30:03,840
I-I really don't know.

386
00:30:04,440 --> 00:30:06,640
I really don't know.

387
00:30:10,360 --> 00:30:14,120
Can I take a look at the corpse of the deceased?

388
00:30:55,560 --> 00:30:58,560
Inside the corpse's mouth and nose, there is no signs of drowning.

389
00:30:58,560 --> 00:31:03,440
It excludes death by drowning. There are multiple bruises on the body and there are signs of a struggle.

390
00:31:03,440 --> 00:31:06,580
The time of death was about a month ago.

391
00:31:06,580 --> 00:31:10,800
Madam, the time of death should be the seventh day of the fifth month.

392
00:31:10,800 --> 00:31:12,600
Thank you.

393
00:31:14,760 --> 00:31:16,960
The coroner from the Imperial Guards is impressive.

394
00:31:16,960 --> 00:31:20,140
To deduce so accurately is admirable.

395
00:31:20,140 --> 00:31:23,520
I have much to learn from you.

396
00:31:29,200 --> 00:31:34,500
Madam and her weeping sister really are quite different.

397
00:31:40,780 --> 00:31:45,560
You're standing so far away. Are you afraid the body will decompose excessively and suddenly explode?

398
00:31:45,560 --> 00:31:49,520
No need to worry. The decomposition is not yet at that stage. It won't explode.

399
00:31:53,600 --> 00:31:56,240
This is far too different.

400
00:31:56,240 --> 00:31:58,600
Are there any other pieces of evidence?

401
00:31:58,600 --> 00:32:02,720
From the bottom of the well, a piece of clothing and a notebook were also retrieved.

402
00:32:02,720 --> 00:32:05,040
Upon examination, the clothing is Han Shiyuan's.

403
00:32:05,040 --> 00:32:07,320
The notebook is from the day of the seventh.

404
00:32:07,320 --> 00:32:10,800
It's the post-class test left by the teacher from Hongwen School.

405
00:32:10,800 --> 00:32:15,940
So the date of death is deduced based on this.

406
00:32:16,540 --> 00:32:18,980
Acquisition of the deceased's information...

407
00:32:19,620 --> 00:32:22,580
is not limited to coroner's autopsy.

408
00:32:23,280 --> 00:32:25,420
Case handling by the Imperial Guards.

409
00:32:28,600 --> 00:32:30,200
- Where is Han Shiyuan? 
 - I don't know.

410
00:32:30,200 --> 00:32:33,140
-  You! Where is Han Shiyuan? 
 - I don't know either.

411
00:32:33,140 --> 00:32:35,860
Not telling me, huh?

412
00:32:35,860 --> 00:32:37,940
Jing Lin.

413
00:32:39,480 --> 00:32:42,820
What kind of questioning is this, forcing a confession? They are almost scared to death. Get out now.

414
00:32:42,820 --> 00:32:44,680
I almost had it out of them.

415
00:32:44,680 --> 00:32:46,496
Let me do the questioning.

416
00:32:54,140 --> 00:32:58,520
Madam might have forgotten that she is also wearing the clothes of the Ministry of Justice.

417
00:32:58,520 --> 00:33:02,380
Usually very low-profile. Not much interaction with us.

418
00:33:04,320 --> 00:33:08,440
Excuse me. During this period of time, did you see Han Shiyuan?

419
00:33:08,920 --> 00:33:12,040
The last time I saw Han Shiyuan was on the evening of the seventh day of the fifth month.

420
00:33:12,040 --> 00:33:13,640
That day I passed by his dormitory.

421
00:33:13,640 --> 00:33:16,240
After he said goodbye to his classmates, he left.

422
00:33:16,240 --> 00:33:19,220
On the evening of the seventh day of the fifth month? Are you so sure?

423
00:33:19,220 --> 00:33:22,120
That day he went out and headed west. I was about to greet him.

424
00:33:22,120 --> 00:33:25,420
But when I turned around, I saw flames to the east.

425
00:33:25,420 --> 00:33:28,020
Then I heard about the great fire at Ming Hall.

426
00:33:28,020 --> 00:33:29,900
So I remember it.

427
00:33:30,560 --> 00:33:33,640
Han Shiyuan is one of the most handsome students in our school.

428
00:33:33,640 --> 00:33:36,640
He normally has little interaction with others.

429
00:33:36,640 --> 00:33:40,220
Oh, yes! You can ask his roommate Lan Guizhou.

430
00:33:40,220 --> 00:33:43,080
However, Lan Guizhou is a person who is always reserved and gloomy.

431
00:33:43,080 --> 00:33:44,880
He only talks to Han Shiyuan.

432
00:33:44,880 --> 00:33:47,350
- Are you Lan Guizhou? 
 - Yes.

433
00:33:47,350 --> 00:33:49,700
Did you see Han Shiyuan on the seventh day of the fifth month?

434
00:33:49,700 --> 00:33:51,160
Yes.

435
00:33:51,160 --> 00:33:53,980
Shiyuan said he was leaving Xiang'an to get married.

436
00:33:53,980 --> 00:33:56,720
After saying goodbye, he headed west.

437
00:33:56,720 --> 00:33:58,720
Okay, thank you.

438
00:34:01,860 --> 00:34:03,620
Sister!

439
00:34:04,340 --> 00:34:06,030
Sister!

440
00:34:06,720 --> 00:34:09,159
Is there anything I can help with?

441
00:34:09,960 --> 00:34:12,380
How come you are everywhere?

442
00:34:13,830 --> 00:34:16,000
I'm here to collect the students' pawned items.

443
00:34:16,000 --> 00:34:19,320
To investigate, one must be like her, going deep into the field.

444
00:34:19,320 --> 00:34:23,640
Her appearance while investigating is truly valiant and spirited.

445
00:34:26,020 --> 00:34:30,620
When can I take her as my teacher and investigate cases with her?

446
00:34:30,620 --> 00:34:32,300
Sister!

447
00:34:34,760 --> 00:34:39,480
No one is allowed to interfere with Clerk Yan's investigation.

448
00:35:05,080 --> 00:35:07,060
What are you worried about?

449
00:35:07,920 --> 00:35:12,160
I just feel something is not right.

450
00:35:12,160 --> 00:35:14,324
Is there a problem with the evidence?

451
00:35:15,300 --> 00:35:17,180
No.

452
00:35:18,040 --> 00:35:22,560
But it's precisely because there is none that I feel it's a bit strange.

453
00:35:24,360 --> 00:35:26,336
Too perfect.

454
00:35:32,660 --> 00:35:34,600
Come and look, take a look.

455
00:35:36,160 --> 00:35:38,640
The testimonial evidence and physical evidence are both overly conclusive.

456
00:35:38,640 --> 00:35:42,320
So much so that it feels a bit contrived.

457
00:35:45,600 --> 00:35:47,540
One can't rely solely on intuition when investigating a case.

458
00:35:47,540 --> 00:35:49,880
I only believe in evidence.

459
00:35:49,880 --> 00:35:54,580
I also believe in evidence. But what if the evidence is fake?

460
00:35:57,300 --> 00:35:59,048
Look over here.

461
00:36:02,800 --> 00:36:04,516
And here as well.

462
00:36:31,800 --> 00:36:33,640
What are you doing?

463
00:36:38,380 --> 00:36:39,960
Too dark.

464
00:36:39,960 --> 00:36:41,440
Where is it dark?

465
00:36:41,440 --> 00:36:45,760
This room is as bright as daylight. I find it dazzling. Okay?

466
00:36:48,200 --> 00:36:51,660
Let's talk about the physical evidence first. It's both the notebook and the piece of clothing.

467
00:36:51,660 --> 00:36:55,360
These two pieces of evidence. It's as if someone is afraid of people not finding Han Shiyuan guilty.

468
00:36:55,360 --> 00:36:58,180
The color of Han Shiyuan's piece of clothing is so conspicuous.

469
00:36:58,180 --> 00:37:01,580
If it were torn off, how could it not be noticeable?

470
00:37:01,580 --> 00:37:04,160
Now look at this. These two student testimonies.

471
00:37:04,160 --> 00:37:06,560
Both say that on the night of the seventh day of the fifth month, they saw Han Shiyuan

472
00:37:06,560 --> 00:37:08,160
and they are very certain.

473
00:37:08,160 --> 00:37:10,460
But that day was the day of our wedding.

474
00:37:10,460 --> 00:37:14,680
Caiwei and Han Shiyuan ran away on the sixth day of the fifth month.

475
00:37:14,680 --> 00:37:17,160
Running away might have been just to avoid your Yan family.

476
00:37:17,160 --> 00:37:19,360
Perhaps they were still in the city on the seventh day of the fifth month,

477
00:37:19,360 --> 00:37:21,860
watching you, the fool, take part in the substitute marriage.

478
00:37:21,860 --> 00:37:26,820
No, before our wedding, Caiwei and Han Shiyuan had already left the city.

479
00:37:26,820 --> 00:37:29,060
You trust Caiwei this much?

480
00:37:31,300 --> 00:37:33,280
Why did she have you substitute in the marriage?

481
00:37:33,280 --> 00:37:37,380
Caiwei had no other choice. Who would want to marry you, the White Ghost?

482
00:37:54,860 --> 00:37:56,908
So aggrieved.

483
00:37:58,220 --> 00:38:00,030
Then you leave as well.

484
00:38:01,200 --> 00:38:03,760
The Palace of Death doesn't welcome you.

485
00:38:05,900 --> 00:38:08,000
I'm leaving then.

486
00:38:34,420 --> 00:38:39,660
 Bravo! 

487
00:38:41,200 --> 00:38:43,480
 Bravo! 

488
00:38:45,200 --> 00:38:47,340
 Bravo! 

489
00:38:47,340 --> 00:38:49,580
 Wonderful! 

490
00:38:51,680 --> 00:38:53,248
 Do it again. 

491
00:38:53,248 --> 00:38:54,920
 Awesome. 

492
00:38:54,920 --> 00:38:57,460
 Here it comes, the hanging ghost is at the door claiming lives. 

493
00:38:57,460 --> 00:39:00,400
 Here it comes, the hanging ghost is at the door claiming lives. 

494
00:39:00,400 --> 00:39:02,830
 Bravo! 

495
00:39:03,600 --> 00:39:05,544
 Bravo! 

496
00:39:08,680 --> 00:39:10,420
 Look! 

497
00:39:17,620 --> 00:39:19,680
 Caught. The ghost has been captured. 

498
00:39:19,680 --> 00:39:21,600
 - The ghost has been captured. 
 - Such divine power. 

499
00:39:21,600 --> 00:39:23,500
 That's amazing. 

500
00:39:23,500 --> 00:39:26,860
 Bravo! 

501
00:39:29,140 --> 00:39:30,700
What divine power do I have?

502
00:39:30,700 --> 00:39:33,700
This is merely the most common sleight of hand.

503
00:39:33,700 --> 00:39:36,800
I operate the mechanism inside. When I operate downwards,

504
00:39:36,800 --> 00:39:39,680
what is shown on this white cloth is an image projected upwards.

505
00:39:39,680 --> 00:39:43,640
Everyone must remember that if someone claims in the future that they can use this magic

506
00:39:43,640 --> 00:39:48,560
to catch ghosts, that person is definitely a charlatan.

507
00:39:49,440 --> 00:39:50,860
 I see. 

508
00:39:50,860 --> 00:39:53,120
 Now I know. 

509
00:39:56,620 --> 00:39:58,640
You're so direct in revealing secrets.

510
00:39:58,640 --> 00:40:00,860
Aren't you afraid of ruining your peers' livelihood

511
00:40:00,860 --> 00:40:02,920
so that they'll give you trouble?

512
00:40:04,020 --> 00:40:04,980
Mozi said, "When the shadow reaches the end at noon, the length of the shadow is determined by the end."

513
00:40:04,980 --> 00:40:08,780
Mozi said, "When the shadow reaches the end at noon, the length of the shadow is determined by the end."

514
00:40:08,780 --> 00:40:10,840
This was known by the ancients thousands of years ago.

515
00:40:10,840 --> 00:40:14,420
Therefore, I think anyone who is a scholar should be aware of this.

516
00:40:14,420 --> 00:40:16,380
So this is not any kind of secret.

517
00:40:16,380 --> 00:40:19,160
Much less should we deceive the common people.

518
00:40:19,160 --> 00:40:22,140
You are quite interesting indeed.

519
00:40:22,140 --> 00:40:27,320
Although you're in the Ghost Market, you're a scholar with integrity.

520
00:40:27,320 --> 00:40:30,820
I just heard that Hongwen School recruits scholars regardless of background.

521
00:40:30,820 --> 00:40:32,800
I came to join in the excitement.

522
00:40:32,800 --> 00:40:36,600
I see. Let me wish you success in advance.

523
00:40:36,600 --> 00:40:38,140
I usually enjoy reading idle books.

524
00:40:38,140 --> 00:40:40,940
When it comes to the classics, I can't really get into them.

525
00:40:40,940 --> 00:40:44,580
I'm afraid I might not meet the standards of Hongwen School.

526
00:40:44,580 --> 00:40:47,260
I can only make a living in this Ghost Market.

527
00:40:47,260 --> 00:40:49,480
You're being modest.

528
00:40:49,480 --> 00:40:52,840
I see you have a study of this art of light and shadow.

529
00:40:52,840 --> 00:40:55,780
There is one thing I would like to ask.

530
00:40:55,780 --> 00:40:59,860
Don't be so formal. Just call me Pan.

531
00:40:59,860 --> 00:41:02,420
If you want to ask about anything, feel free to do it.

532
00:41:02,420 --> 00:41:05,460
Whether it's the art of self-defense or the way to manage a husband,

533
00:41:05,460 --> 00:41:07,360
I know a thing or two.

534
00:41:07,360 --> 00:41:09,400
I have no need for these.

535
00:41:09,400 --> 00:41:12,160
In this contraption of yours, originally there is no ghost.

536
00:41:12,160 --> 00:41:13,980
Yet it seems as if there is one.

537
00:41:13,980 --> 00:41:16,200
Do you know whether there is a way

538
00:41:16,200 --> 00:41:20,480
to make people outside feel as if they see him when there is no one in the room?

539
00:41:21,280 --> 00:41:23,060
There are no ghosts or gods in this world.

540
00:41:23,060 --> 00:41:25,320
Nor does anyone know the true form of ghosts and gods.

541
00:41:25,320 --> 00:41:28,300
But it's different with the living. Living people all look different.

542
00:41:28,300 --> 00:41:30,940
It's not easy to disguise.

543
00:41:30,940 --> 00:41:32,340
Exactly so.

544
00:41:32,340 --> 00:41:36,480
Miss, you may articulate your question and elaborate upon it.

545
00:41:36,480 --> 00:41:39,340
For example, the time, the lighting, the position within the room,

546
00:41:39,340 --> 00:41:42,000
or the appearances of the people inside and outside the room, and so on.

547
00:41:42,000 --> 00:41:43,580
Okay.

548
00:41:46,920 --> 00:41:49,340
 Bravo! 

549
00:42:05,020 --> 00:42:06,820
What brings you to the Imperial Guards?

550
00:42:06,820 --> 00:42:10,360
I have found the evidence. Han Shiyuan has been wronged.

551
00:42:10,360 --> 00:42:11,440
Oh? What evidence?

552
00:42:11,440 --> 00:42:12,880
Follow me to the Hongwen School tonight.

553
00:42:12,880 --> 00:42:15,520
I will have you capture the criminal on the spot.

554
00:42:18,020 --> 00:42:27,920
