00:00:27,610 --> 00:00:31,980
 "Go Ahead Fearlessly" - Liu Yuning 

3
00:00:31,980 --> 00:00:35,024
â™«  Grudges and karma, right and wrong  â™«

4
00:00:35,024 --> 00:00:38,222
â™«  The past hides blood and tears  â™«

5
00:00:38,222 --> 00:00:40,691
â™«  It is hard to catch up after years of separation  â™«

6
00:00:40,691 --> 00:00:44,566
â™«  The truth cannot be fully revealed  â™«

7
00:00:44,566 --> 00:00:47,601
â™«  Fate is full of twists and turns  â™«

8
00:00:47,601 --> 00:00:50,866
â™«  Life and death, fortune and misfortune go hand in hand  â™«

9
00:00:50,866 --> 00:00:55,902
â™«  Obsession is hard to get rid of, keeping the truth 
 and getting rid of the lies, let the wind blow  â™«

10
00:00:55,902 --> 00:01:02,274
â™«  Tossed about by the wind and rain, I will never regret it, 
 I will accompany you for my whole life  â™«

11
00:01:02,274 --> 00:01:08,582
â™«  At least you share my joy and sorrow  â™«

12
00:01:08,582 --> 00:01:14,861
â™«  Unravelling fate, fearlessly, a dream returns  â™«

13
00:01:14,861 --> 00:01:21,174
â™«  The mountains and rivers are bright and beautiful, 
 holding hands, together we return  â™«

14
00:01:21,174 --> 00:01:29,018
â™«  In this life, my heart returns untainted of dust and ash  â™«

15
00:01:29,018 --> 00:01:37,252
   

16
00:01:37,252 --> 00:01:40,240
   

17
00:01:40,900 --> 00:01:44,280
Just sit in and listen. Do not cause trouble.

18
00:01:44,280 --> 00:01:48,880
Or you'll be charged with disrupting the court trial.

19
00:01:50,080 --> 00:01:52,500
How terrifying!

20
00:01:52,500 --> 00:01:54,170
But then again,

21
00:01:54,170 --> 00:01:57,100
even if Ji Fangming is a minor official in the Ministry of Justice,

22
00:01:57,100 --> 00:02:00,080
he is still appointed by the imperial court.

23
00:02:00,080 --> 00:02:06,040
I certainly will not stand by and let you force a confession.

24
00:02:13,900 --> 00:02:17,010
Ji Fangming, you may have many tricks up your sleeves,

25
00:02:17,010 --> 00:02:19,300
but those are nothing but tricks.

26
00:02:19,300 --> 00:02:23,280
What's fake is fake. Truth can't be forged.

27
00:02:23,280 --> 00:02:25,590
You have been plotting for years

28
00:02:25,590 --> 00:02:29,520
just to find out the truth about the case of the Jinxiu Workshop.

29
00:02:29,520 --> 00:02:32,910
What a pity! You ended up targeting and killing

30
00:02:32,910 --> 00:02:35,220
the wrong person for your revenge,

31
00:02:35,220 --> 00:02:38,380
unaware that you were being used.

32
00:02:40,020 --> 00:02:41,800
Clerk Yan, save your breath.

33
00:02:41,800 --> 00:02:47,220
Your attempt to lure a confession from me is not so innovative.

34
00:02:47,220 --> 00:02:52,700
Since you're so curious, I will tell you the truth.

35
00:02:55,660 --> 00:02:59,980
Chen Shoujie and his wife, Madam Chen, were the instigators of that case.

36
00:02:59,980 --> 00:03:02,680
I plotted everything that had happened these days

37
00:03:02,680 --> 00:03:07,220
just to avenge the dozens of people who had died from injustice at the Jinxiu Workshop.

38
00:03:07,220 --> 00:03:12,560
Why are you so certain that you know the absolute truth?

39
00:03:12,560 --> 00:03:15,360
Madam Chen used to be an embroideress there.

40
00:03:15,360 --> 00:03:18,460
Chen Shoujie took advantage of his position to cover for her

41
00:03:18,460 --> 00:03:21,960
by forging her background and falsifying others' testimonies.

42
00:03:21,960 --> 00:03:25,020
Back then, before Kong Xianrong delivered the summer clothing design

43
00:03:25,020 --> 00:03:26,760
to Princess Runing's mansion,

44
00:03:26,760 --> 00:03:30,940
he had checked them in person and sealed them after checking with the embroideresses.

45
00:03:30,940 --> 00:03:35,640
Therefore, it must have been swapped by one of the embroideresses.

46
00:03:35,640 --> 00:03:40,020
After that, everyone at the Jinxiu Workshop was put away for interrogation.

47
00:03:40,020 --> 00:03:44,080
Only Madam Chen got away with it.

48
00:03:44,080 --> 00:03:49,480
Once I found out about it, I went to sound Chen Shoujie out.

49
00:03:49,480 --> 00:03:53,660
 Shoujie, do you remember this? 

50
00:03:53,660 --> 00:03:56,012
   

51
00:03:59,880 --> 00:04:01,936
 Jinxiu Workshop? 

52
00:04:05,720 --> 00:04:09,000
 No, you can't mention it! I don't want to die! 

53
00:04:10,960 --> 00:04:14,100
 I apologize. We apologize. We don't know anything. 

54
00:04:14,100 --> 00:04:18,040
 Every grievance has a source. Please don't come to us for retribution. 

55
00:04:18,040 --> 00:04:20,420
 Wife, you must not say anything! 

56
00:04:20,420 --> 00:04:25,880
Just because of that, you concluded that Chen Shoujie was the murderer?

57
00:04:25,880 --> 00:04:30,340
Do you know why those people would be terrified by the illusions?

58
00:04:30,340 --> 00:04:33,510
Because they knew that the deceased had died unjustly

59
00:04:33,510 --> 00:04:35,540
and might seek retaliation as vengeful spirits.

60
00:04:35,540 --> 00:04:38,800
They felt guilty!

61
00:04:41,780 --> 00:04:44,380
Spirits don't exist in this world.

62
00:04:45,140 --> 00:04:48,580
Even if they do, they only exist in people's minds.

63
00:04:48,580 --> 00:04:53,440
If you have a clear conscience, why would you be afraid of them?

64
00:04:53,440 --> 00:04:55,900
Minister Shen, you're truly upright.

65
00:04:55,900 --> 00:05:00,360
But not everyone is like you've described.

66
00:05:00,360 --> 00:05:03,360
Some people may be able to act decent

67
00:05:03,360 --> 00:05:08,080
even if they have done something shameful!

68
00:05:08,080 --> 00:05:12,880
They may appear just like ordinary people.

69
00:05:12,880 --> 00:05:15,640
So you killed Madam Chen.

70
00:05:15,640 --> 00:05:19,620
That's right! She deserved to die! She was the ringleader!

71
00:05:19,620 --> 00:05:25,480
She was the one who swapped the summer clothing design.

72
00:05:31,280 --> 00:05:33,040
 Jinxiu Workshop. 

73
00:05:33,040 --> 00:05:34,900
 Karma has gotten me! 

74
00:05:34,900 --> 00:05:36,460
 Do you have anything to say? 

75
00:05:36,460 --> 00:05:38,860
 It's time to pay my debt. 

76
00:05:41,220 --> 00:05:46,320
I killed her to comfort the spirit of my best friend in heaven.

77
00:05:46,320 --> 00:05:48,200
What's wrong with that?

78
00:05:48,200 --> 00:05:52,980
Even the most sinister criminal shall be punished by the court and the law.

79
00:05:52,980 --> 00:05:55,520
You are free to seek justice by appealing the case.

80
00:05:55,520 --> 00:05:57,960
But you can't take the law into your own hands.

81
00:05:57,960 --> 00:05:59,840
That's easy for you to say.

82
00:05:59,840 --> 00:06:02,720
Seeking justice? Appealing the case?

83
00:06:02,720 --> 00:06:06,440
So many years have passed. Everyone knows it was a wrongful conviction.

84
00:06:06,440 --> 00:06:10,420
But who is willing to step forward and do justice?

85
00:06:11,900 --> 00:06:15,340
Forget about others. Let's just talk about you.

86
00:06:15,340 --> 00:06:19,720
Holding a high position, you've won the Empress Dowager's trust.

87
00:06:19,720 --> 00:06:24,360
Yet you have let this case remain buried for years.

88
00:06:26,440 --> 00:06:32,200
In that case, I might as well deal with the real culprits.

89
00:06:34,020 --> 00:06:37,270
So you killed Madam Chen and spared Chen Shoujie,

90
00:06:37,270 --> 00:06:39,380
who lost his senses due to the shock,

91
00:06:39,380 --> 00:06:45,060
not for the sake of the old days, but to torture him alive. Right?

92
00:06:47,020 --> 00:06:48,960
That's right.

93
00:06:48,960 --> 00:06:51,960
Madam Chen was the instigator and deserved to die.

94
00:06:51,960 --> 00:06:57,500
As for Chen Shoujie, I didn't kill him not because I didn't want to.

95
00:06:57,500 --> 00:07:00,850
He shielded the murderer and cannot escape the blame.

96
00:07:00,850 --> 00:07:03,780
An easy death wouldn't serve him right.

97
00:07:05,780 --> 00:07:11,380
It suddenly occurred to me that I could torture him to death.

98
00:07:11,380 --> 00:07:15,280
Let him experience the helplessness and despair we had experienced

99
00:07:15,280 --> 00:07:18,860
when we lost our family and friends back then!

100
00:07:19,840 --> 00:07:21,600
Brother Xianrong.

101
00:07:22,310 --> 00:07:25,980
I have finally done you justice. 
    

102
00:07:25,980 --> 00:07:27,670
Those people should be 
    

103
00:07:27,670 --> 00:07:32,160
condemned to never enter the cycle of reincarnation!

104
00:07:32,160 --> 00:07:36,580
But now, he has already gone mad!

105
00:07:36,580 --> 00:07:39,800
Yet you all still believe that he is innocent.

106
00:07:39,800 --> 00:07:43,440
You just won't accept the fact that the deceased were wrongfully accused.

107
00:07:43,440 --> 00:07:46,500
So you are all guilty as well!

108
00:07:46,500 --> 00:07:51,000
You all should pay the price for this.

109
00:07:53,720 --> 00:07:55,190
 What fire moths? 

110
00:07:55,190 --> 00:07:58,560
 Fire moths, fire moths, fire moths! 

111
00:08:05,230 --> 00:08:07,130
   

112
00:08:20,160 --> 00:08:25,160
I found the fabric of the Jinxiu Workshop at Chen Shoujie's mansion.

113
00:08:25,160 --> 00:08:28,420
If they were the real culprits as you said,

114
00:08:28,420 --> 00:08:30,990
why would they carefully preserve something

115
00:08:30,990 --> 00:08:34,440
that constantly reminded them of their sin?

116
00:08:36,650 --> 00:08:38,120
No way!

117
00:08:38,120 --> 00:08:40,480
Perhaps, you're not the only one

118
00:08:40,480 --> 00:08:45,120
feeling helpless and anguished after the incident.

119
00:08:51,820 --> 00:08:53,840
I can't be wrong.

120
00:08:54,580 --> 00:08:56,340
There's no way I'm wrong.

121
00:08:56,340 --> 00:09:00,700
Perhaps you were blinded by revenge and didn't realize that

122
00:09:00,700 --> 00:09:03,450
Mrs. Chen kept staring at the hidden compartment

123
00:09:03,450 --> 00:09:06,560
on the roof beam where she had hidden the cloth until she died.

124
00:09:06,560 --> 00:09:11,180
Perhaps she wanted to talk but she never got the chance.

125
00:09:24,120 --> 00:09:29,080
It's all my fault. It's all my fault.

126
00:09:29,900 --> 00:09:33,440
I shouldn't have concealed the truth for years.

127
00:09:33,440 --> 00:09:35,180
I didn't want to die.

128
00:09:35,180 --> 00:09:38,820
I have harmed so many people to protect my family.

129
00:09:38,820 --> 00:09:41,740
I deserve to die.

130
00:09:44,720 --> 00:09:47,320
No one can wrap fire in paper.

131
00:09:47,320 --> 00:09:51,040
The truth is about to come to light.

132
00:09:51,040 --> 00:09:54,700
Xianrong, I owe you an apology.

133
00:09:54,700 --> 00:10:00,400
I was coerced to close the case in such a hurry because I was afraid of death.

134
00:10:00,400 --> 00:10:05,500
I didn't expectâ€¦ I didn't expectâ€¦

135
00:10:05,500 --> 00:10:10,020
Coerced? By whom? Tell me now.

136
00:10:14,100 --> 00:10:15,860
What's the point of confessing now?

137
00:10:15,860 --> 00:10:19,860
So many people have suffered injustice and couldn't find peace.

138
00:10:19,860 --> 00:10:23,460
As a public official, you covered up the truth because the real culprit intimated you.

139
00:10:23,460 --> 00:10:27,140
Can you bring back the deceased even if you confess now?

140
00:10:27,140 --> 00:10:28,880
Who coerced you?

141
00:10:28,880 --> 00:10:31,020
Huo'eâ€¦

142
00:10:31,020 --> 00:10:34,640
Chen Huo'e! Chen Huo'e! Chen Huo'e!

143
00:10:37,080 --> 00:10:39,740
Chen Huo'e!

144
00:10:39,740 --> 00:10:42,100
Chen Huo'e again?

145
00:10:43,260 --> 00:10:46,180
No way, I didn't kill the wrong person.

146
00:10:46,180 --> 00:10:50,320
Madam Chen was the culprit. She wouldn't have lied to me.

147
00:11:05,100 --> 00:11:09,500
Who instructed you to lead Yan Xing to the Mingsheng Temple?

148
00:11:10,300 --> 00:11:12,240
They used me for real.

149
00:11:12,800 --> 00:11:14,800
They used me for real.

150
00:11:25,500 --> 00:11:29,800
People laugh at the moths flying to the flame.

151
00:11:29,800 --> 00:11:33,700
But no one knows that mayflies live at dawn and die at dusk,

152
00:11:33,700 --> 00:11:37,800
not entering the cycle of reincarnation, while moths survive the fire and await reincarnation.

153
00:11:37,800 --> 00:11:40,500
Ji Fangming, wake up.

154
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:45,400
Kong Xianrong never stopped proclaiming his innocence.

155
00:11:45,400 --> 00:11:49,000
All he wanted was justice and the truth.

156
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:53,400
But you were blinded by hatred and were incited to kill the innocent.

157
00:11:53,400 --> 00:11:57,700
How are you any different from those who framed the Jinxiu Workshop?

158
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:01,200
There's solid evidence,

159
00:12:01,200 --> 00:12:04,200
yet you are still spreading deceitful rumors to confuse the public.

160
00:12:07,800 --> 00:12:09,400
Great Chief Shen,

161
00:12:09,400 --> 00:12:14,200
don't you want to know who the other culprits are

162
00:12:14,200 --> 00:12:19,100
as Chen Huo'e told me after she got resurrected?

163
00:12:24,360 --> 00:12:26,800
The real culprit is...

164
00:12:29,100 --> 00:12:30,700
the Princess of Valor.

165
00:12:30,700 --> 00:12:34,700
The Princess of Valor has been jealous of Princess Runing for years.

166
00:12:34,700 --> 00:12:38,300
- Thus, she used the Jinxiu Workshop to frame her. 
 - Shut your mouth!

167
00:12:38,300 --> 00:12:41,000
Apart from her, Prince Xian was also involved.

168
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:45,500
He wouldn't settle for less than the Princess of Valor and craved power.

169
00:12:45,500 --> 00:12:48,800
And the Grand Empress Dowager. They are all murderers.

170
00:12:48,800 --> 00:12:50,300
Youâ€¦

171
00:12:50,300 --> 00:12:53,200
You're all murderers.

172
00:12:55,200 --> 00:12:58,400
You're making a fuss by framing the royal family

173
00:12:58,400 --> 00:13:03,100
and slandering the Grand Empress Dowager just to get a retrial.

174
00:13:03,100 --> 00:13:07,000
Great Chief Shen, this is a serious matter.

175
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:08,800
A retrial may have implications.

176
00:13:08,800 --> 00:13:10,700
Do not bring trouble upon yourself.

177
00:13:10,700 --> 00:13:14,200
Just ignore this madman's ravings.

178
00:13:14,200 --> 00:13:16,400
Wu Taiming, you despicable being!

179
00:13:16,400 --> 00:13:18,400
I am not crazy.

180
00:13:18,400 --> 00:13:23,800
I am more awake than ever.

181
00:13:23,800 --> 00:13:27,000
I mean everything I say.

182
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:31,600
Great Chief Shen, I wonder if you dare to report what I said

183
00:13:31,600 --> 00:13:37,000
to the Grand Empress Dowager without missing a single word.

184
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:49,000
You're really wishing for the death penalty.

185
00:13:51,600 --> 00:13:54,500
If I can console

186
00:13:54,500 --> 00:13:58,200
those lost souls and spirits by sacrificing myself,

187
00:14:00,300 --> 00:14:02,100
then it is worth it.

188
00:14:04,800 --> 00:14:06,810
In that case,

189
00:14:07,460 --> 00:14:10,000
I shall do as you wish.

190
00:14:11,500 --> 00:14:16,500
I will report what happened today to the Grand Empress Dowager.

191
00:14:18,640 --> 00:14:22,400
Vice Minister Lai, what do you think?

192
00:14:22,400 --> 00:14:24,200
You are the chief judge.

193
00:14:24,200 --> 00:14:28,800
The Imperial Inspectorate is merely sitting in on the murder case of Madam Chen.

194
00:14:28,800 --> 00:14:33,200
The final ruling is up to you, Great Chief.

195
00:14:34,900 --> 00:14:36,800
One acts indifferently.

196
00:14:36,800 --> 00:14:38,600
The other is as sly as a fox.

197
00:14:38,600 --> 00:14:40,800
They make sure they stay out of the matter.

198
00:14:40,800 --> 00:14:45,100
I, Ji Fangming, appreciate your effort on behalf of the wronged souls,

199
00:14:45,100 --> 00:14:47,800
Great Chief Shen.

200
00:15:02,400 --> 00:15:07,600
I truly admire you for your intelligence and courage, Clerk Yan.

201
00:15:07,600 --> 00:15:10,900
I wonder if you're interested in joining the Imperial Inspectorate.

202
00:15:10,900 --> 00:15:15,500
I'm in dire need of a capable assistant like you.

203
00:15:20,200 --> 00:15:26,000
Master Wu, you won't be so petty as to hold on to a talent. Right?

204
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:28,000
Please don't make fun of me, My Lord.

205
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:30,800
Yan Xing may be working for the Ministry of Justice,

206
00:15:30,800 --> 00:15:35,800
but she is also Great Chief Shen's wife.

207
00:15:35,800 --> 00:15:41,200
You surely don't intend to take my person away in my presence. Right?

208
00:15:43,840 --> 00:15:46,000
What an accusation.

209
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:48,700
It seems I have been rash and inconsiderate.

210
00:15:48,700 --> 00:15:52,000
I simply wished to recruit some talents under my wing.

211
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:53,600
Please don't be paranoid.

212
00:15:53,600 --> 00:15:55,000
Paranoid?

213
00:15:55,000 --> 00:16:00,500
After all these years, you're still an expert in making counter charges.

214
00:16:02,600 --> 00:16:06,000
Matters of the officialdom should not involve family.

215
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:08,400
Given your way of handling things,

216
00:16:08,400 --> 00:16:11,400
I'm afraid that Clerk Yan wouldn't have a good time

217
00:16:11,400 --> 00:16:13,500
if she had to spend all day with you to solve cases.

218
00:16:13,500 --> 00:16:17,800
Besides, a fine bird chooses the tree upon which to perch.

219
00:16:17,800 --> 00:16:23,700
You shouldn't hinder those who have a promising future. Right?

220
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:38,400
I'm quite content with this tree.

221
00:16:38,400 --> 00:16:40,800
I am a lazy person who enjoys a leisurely life.

222
00:16:40,800 --> 00:16:43,560
I don't intend to work somewhere else yet.

223
00:16:45,400 --> 00:16:48,700
Minister Lai, thank you for your recognition.

224
00:16:50,700 --> 00:16:55,000
In that case, I'll wait and see

225
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:59,500
how great the tree you've chosen can be.

226
00:17:11,200 --> 00:17:15,600
People say that although a couple were birds from the same forest,

227
00:17:15,600 --> 00:17:18,600
they'd fly in separate directions in adversity.

228
00:17:18,600 --> 00:17:22,400
Master Wu, what do you think?

229
00:17:22,400 --> 00:17:25,600
Wellâ€¦ I am dull-witted.

230
00:17:25,600 --> 00:17:30,800
Love and affection are unfathomable to me.

231
00:17:30,800 --> 00:17:33,600
"Love and affection." Well said.

232
00:17:33,600 --> 00:17:35,600
Interesting!

233
00:17:43,900 --> 00:17:46,400
 It's a serious matter. 

234
00:17:46,400 --> 00:17:48,100
 A retrial may have implications. 

235
00:17:48,100 --> 00:17:51,400
 Do not bring trouble upon yourself. 

236
00:17:51,400 --> 00:17:55,900
 The final ruling is up to you, Great Chief. 

237
00:18:05,560 --> 00:18:08,800
What are you thinking? Why are you absorbed?

238
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:19,000
I'm so tired. I need to rest now.

239
00:18:31,200 --> 00:18:33,200
Is something wrong?

240
00:18:34,100 --> 00:18:38,900
Yun Que seems particularly concerned about this interrogation.

241
00:18:41,500 --> 00:18:45,800
She has been after the case of the Jinxiu Workshop all along.

242
00:18:45,800 --> 00:18:49,600
Now, she can no longer hold back.

243
00:18:51,300 --> 00:18:55,000
So you kept her in the mansion just to find out

244
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:57,400
whether she showed up out of a coincidence

245
00:18:57,400 --> 00:18:59,500
or if someone was fanning the flames.

246
00:18:59,500 --> 00:19:01,200
Jing Lin has looked into her.

247
00:19:01,200 --> 00:19:04,060
She doesn't know much about the matter.

248
00:19:04,800 --> 00:19:06,800
- Howeverâ€¦ 
 - However what?

249
00:19:06,800 --> 00:19:09,600
However, her parents did have a lot of business dealings with

250
00:19:09,600 --> 00:19:12,100
Jinxiu Workshop in the past.

251
00:19:13,800 --> 00:19:16,400
But they were not implicated.

252
00:19:16,400 --> 00:19:18,800
If they hid evidence to protect themselves,

253
00:19:18,800 --> 00:19:21,090
then why did she steal the evidence to seek justice

254
00:19:21,090 --> 00:19:23,600
after Chen Huo'e showed up?

255
00:19:23,600 --> 00:19:25,800
Isn't it too much of a coincidence?

256
00:19:25,800 --> 00:19:29,900
If that's the case, why don't you ask them directly?

257
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:33,200
It's not time yet.

258
00:19:33,200 --> 00:19:37,700
And I'm afraid it won't be easy to keep them alive to testify.

259
00:19:38,800 --> 00:19:42,200
We are in the light, the enemy in the dark.

260
00:19:43,400 --> 00:19:46,400
Just leave it to me.

261
00:19:46,400 --> 00:19:49,700
But the old case involves multiple parties.

262
00:19:49,700 --> 00:19:52,900
Even Wu Taiming and Lai Luozhi were desperate to stay out of it.

263
00:19:52,900 --> 00:19:58,800
It seems that the truth might be much darker than I expected.

264
00:19:59,700 --> 00:20:05,300
What a surprise! The fearless Sixth Miss Yan can be afraid.

265
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:13,100
Are you really going to convey Ji Fangming's dangerous statements

266
00:20:13,100 --> 00:20:15,600
to the Grand Empress Dowager?

267
00:20:15,600 --> 00:20:20,800
I promised someone to get to the bottom of this old case in person.

268
00:20:20,800 --> 00:20:22,700
Someone?

269
00:20:25,400 --> 00:20:28,600
It can't be Princess Runingâ€¦

270
00:20:31,800 --> 00:20:33,600
Fearlessness comes from ignorance.

271
00:20:33,600 --> 00:20:35,600
Deep fear derives from knowledge.

272
00:20:35,600 --> 00:20:39,000
Now I see the gap between us.

273
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:40,800
You knew this day would come,

274
00:20:40,800 --> 00:20:42,800
yet you remained so calm and composed.

275
00:20:42,800 --> 00:20:45,800
You don't sound like yourself.

276
00:20:45,800 --> 00:20:47,800
Usually, you'd jump into action the moment

277
00:20:47,800 --> 00:20:49,600
you heard about wrongful convictions.

278
00:20:49,600 --> 00:20:51,100
And no one could stop you.

279
00:20:51,100 --> 00:20:52,500
Of course.

280
00:20:52,500 --> 00:20:54,800
Stand against injustice to serve justice.

281
00:20:54,800 --> 00:20:59,000
That's our job as officials who get paid by the imperial court.

282
00:21:01,200 --> 00:21:04,200
But I'm also aware of

283
00:21:04,200 --> 00:21:07,300
the consequences of reopening the Jinxiu Workshop case.

284
00:21:07,300 --> 00:21:11,600
With nothing but Ji Fangming's accusation, I'm afraidâ€¦

285
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:16,000
You have improved.

286
00:21:24,600 --> 00:21:27,200
That wrongful conviction caused a sensation

287
00:21:27,200 --> 00:21:30,200
and traumatized many commoners.

288
00:21:30,200 --> 00:21:31,800
If we retry the case,

289
00:21:31,800 --> 00:21:34,400
the shadows will fall upon all of us again.

290
00:21:34,400 --> 00:21:36,600
No one will be able to avoid it.

291
00:21:36,600 --> 00:21:38,300
That's right.

292
00:21:38,300 --> 00:21:42,800
They wanted to use Ji Fangming to bring attention to the old case

293
00:21:42,800 --> 00:21:46,600
and lead the people to doubt the royal family.

294
00:21:46,600 --> 00:21:48,800
Ji Fangming must have realized

295
00:21:48,800 --> 00:21:52,800
that he was being used but he had no choice.

296
00:21:52,800 --> 00:21:54,800
How pitiful!

297
00:21:56,200 --> 00:21:58,200
And tragic!

298
00:21:59,200 --> 00:22:03,000
How confident are you about the retrial?

299
00:22:04,800 --> 00:22:07,960
That's why I am worried. It's been so many years.

300
00:22:07,960 --> 00:22:11,580
The Grand Empress Dowager may not allow a retrial if you bring it up suddenly.

301
00:22:11,580 --> 00:22:14,460
Besides, what if she takes it out on youâ€¦

302
00:22:16,760 --> 00:22:21,000
So, you've been worried since you left the Ministry of Justice

303
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:23,160
because of me?

304
00:22:29,560 --> 00:22:31,520
I'm not worried about you.

305
00:22:31,520 --> 00:22:33,040
I'm worried you'll get me involved.

306
00:22:33,040 --> 00:22:37,140
Anyway, I am known as Madam Shen at the moment.

307
00:22:37,140 --> 00:22:41,900
And I have to think about all these people in our household.

308
00:22:41,900 --> 00:22:44,200
Everyone holds a position.

309
00:22:44,200 --> 00:22:46,900
The wronged people want the old case to be reviewed.

310
00:22:46,900 --> 00:22:52,220
And the Grand Empress Dowager wants nothing but peace and happiness for the people.

311
00:22:53,030 --> 00:22:54,560
But what about you?

312
00:22:54,560 --> 00:22:56,980
Don't worry about me.

313
00:22:56,980 --> 00:23:00,920
I have this under control.

314
00:23:01,580 --> 00:23:04,700
I said I'm not worried about you.

315
00:23:17,660 --> 00:23:22,240
Then I'll leave the one at home to you, Wife.

316
00:23:22,240 --> 00:23:26,400
Since you know she is trouble, why do you still keep her around?

317
00:23:26,400 --> 00:23:32,120
She may have key evidence on her.

318
00:23:32,120 --> 00:23:34,520
Is that your explanation?

319
00:23:34,520 --> 00:23:37,230
White Ghost is truly cold and callous.

320
00:23:37,230 --> 00:23:39,780
You only cause people trouble.

321
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:53,420
Jing Lin, keep an eye on Yun Que.

322
00:23:53,420 --> 00:23:56,880
If you find a chance, check and see if she's still hiding

323
00:23:56,880 --> 00:23:58,500
something about the case.

324
00:23:58,500 --> 00:24:00,192
Understood.

325
00:24:09,467 --> 00:24:12,074
   

326
00:24:29,160 --> 00:24:31,580
Abduct someone for me.

327
00:24:33,420 --> 00:24:34,940
It's not a real abduction.

328
00:24:34,940 --> 00:24:40,160
I just need you to make a trip to Jiangnan and bring the person safely here.

329
00:24:41,800 --> 00:24:43,530
Jiangnan?

330
00:24:44,520 --> 00:24:46,000
I remember that Yun Que

331
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:50,960
who wants to take your place as Madam Shen is from Jiangnan. Right?

332
00:24:52,160 --> 00:24:54,700
Don't tell me you're jealous and want toâ€¦

333
00:24:54,700 --> 00:24:57,910
Please, Talented Young Master Pan.

334
00:24:57,910 --> 00:25:02,640
Master Pan. Pan Chi. Only you can help me with this.

335
00:25:02,640 --> 00:25:05,100
Please.

336
00:25:05,760 --> 00:25:07,400
It's not such a big deal.

337
00:25:07,400 --> 00:25:10,840
- However, it's a bit of legwork. 
 - Rest assured.

338
00:25:10,840 --> 00:25:14,480
Once you return, I will definitely treat you to a feast

339
00:25:14,480 --> 00:25:17,060
and buy you top-quality alcohol.

340
00:25:17,060 --> 00:25:20,840
Besides, I can tell that you're no ordinary merchant.

341
00:25:20,840 --> 00:25:24,280
But I swear I won't expose you.

342
00:25:25,620 --> 00:25:27,520
Are you threatening me?

343
00:25:27,520 --> 00:25:30,640
Of course not. How would I dare?

344
00:25:30,640 --> 00:25:34,760
After all, we are good friends who help each other out.

345
00:25:34,760 --> 00:25:37,480
- Just friends? 
 - What did you say?

346
00:25:37,480 --> 00:25:41,780
Nothing. Then I'll be waiting for the feast.

347
00:25:42,720 --> 00:25:46,920
Right. Take this with you. It's on the way.

348
00:25:48,760 --> 00:25:53,360
- What is this? 
 - A list of the people killed by Chen Huo'e.

349
00:25:53,980 --> 00:25:55,240
Youâ€¦

350
00:25:55,240 --> 00:25:57,040
The crossed-out ones are the names

351
00:25:57,040 --> 00:25:59,880
of the victims who were murdered near Xiang'an.

352
00:25:59,880 --> 00:26:02,080
You'll pass by a few on the way,

353
00:26:02,080 --> 00:26:05,760
so you can inquire about the deceased.

354
00:26:07,880 --> 00:26:11,780
It's so hard to get a treat from you.

355
00:26:12,980 --> 00:26:17,560
Right. Take this. I just obtained it.

356
00:26:17,560 --> 00:26:19,540
Why are you giving me a fan?

357
00:26:19,540 --> 00:26:21,120
Is there something fancy?

358
00:26:21,120 --> 00:26:25,100
Be careful now. It has a mechanism.

359
00:26:25,100 --> 00:26:28,980
The fan handle is hollow. You can put powder in it.

360
00:26:28,980 --> 00:26:32,860
With a little sprinkle, you can disperse the powder without anyone noticing.

361
00:26:32,860 --> 00:26:36,120
The fan handle is hollow.

362
00:26:36,120 --> 00:26:38,340
Is this for poisoning?

363
00:26:38,340 --> 00:26:39,840
That's not exactly the case.

364
00:26:39,840 --> 00:26:44,460
How you use a hidden weapon is up to you.

365
00:26:45,940 --> 00:26:49,420
You're giving me such a rare item?

366
00:26:49,420 --> 00:26:52,480
Don't tell meâ€¦

367
00:26:53,840 --> 00:26:55,940
Don't tell meâ€¦

368
00:26:56,720 --> 00:26:59,760
Don't tell me you're forcing me to buy it?!

369
00:26:59,760 --> 00:27:03,640
Just take it for now. You can pay me if you find it useful.

370
00:27:03,640 --> 00:27:05,600
So you are indeed forcing me to buy it.

371
00:27:05,600 --> 00:27:07,560
Is there poison in it?

372
00:27:07,560 --> 00:27:12,900
It can't kill anyone. But it can easily take down a cow.

373
00:27:14,500 --> 00:27:16,020
 Have you heard? 

374
00:27:16,020 --> 00:27:19,080
 - Another miracle at the Jinxiu Workshop ruins. 
 - Really? 

375
00:27:19,080 --> 00:27:22,400
Swarms of moths fluttered against the wall. Blood formed words.

376
00:27:22,400 --> 00:27:25,480
Even the moths are crying out for justice for the deceased.

377
00:27:25,480 --> 00:27:29,300
These moths are sinister. They're taking revenge on the real culprits.

378
00:27:29,300 --> 00:27:31,980
The Jinxiu Workshop matter happened so many years ago.

379
00:27:31,980 --> 00:27:33,580
 Why is it happening so suddenly? 

380
00:27:33,580 --> 00:27:37,620
Haven't you heard? Someone else has died because of that case.

381
00:27:37,620 --> 00:27:40,260
Everyone is deeply concerned.

382
00:27:41,080 --> 00:27:42,820
It must have been a wrong conviction.

383
00:27:42,820 --> 00:27:45,420
Too many people died tragically, unable to be vindicated.

384
00:27:45,420 --> 00:27:47,120
That's why they lingered here.

385
00:27:47,120 --> 00:27:50,040
Surely they won't just go after anyone. Right?

386
00:27:50,040 --> 00:27:51,800
We are innocent.

387
00:27:51,800 --> 00:27:54,020
It's said that only by reopening the case

388
00:27:54,020 --> 00:27:58,300
and doing justice can these wronged spirits rest in peace.

389
00:27:58,300 --> 00:28:00,835
   

390
00:28:05,860 --> 00:28:07,700
Why aren't you eating?

391
00:28:10,020 --> 00:28:12,560
The noodles are getting mushy.

392
00:28:13,560 --> 00:28:16,920
You came back so late. I bet you've eaten outside.

393
00:28:16,920 --> 00:28:21,580
Of course. I don't mind working hard but I can't starve.

394
00:28:24,100 --> 00:28:26,780
I have done so much in the past few days.

395
00:28:26,780 --> 00:28:28,920
I'm exhausted.

396
00:28:31,200 --> 00:28:32,976
Dig in.

397
00:28:35,940 --> 00:28:37,440
You know what?

398
00:28:37,440 --> 00:28:40,300
I visited the Jinxiu Workshop at night

399
00:28:40,300 --> 00:28:44,500
and as expected, I saw something like a ghost fire floating in midair.

400
00:28:44,500 --> 00:28:49,420
There was something drifting, but I couldn't see it clearly.

401
00:28:49,420 --> 00:28:54,460
That must be the ghostly shadow mentioned by the people.

402
00:28:54,460 --> 00:28:59,440
On the way back, I saw each and every household next to the Jinxiu Workshop

403
00:28:59,440 --> 00:29:02,340
having this hung above the entrance.

404
00:29:02,340 --> 00:29:04,660
The Moth Jade.

405
00:29:12,560 --> 00:29:14,800
You went there alone at night?

406
00:29:14,800 --> 00:29:16,640
Didn't you find it creepy?

407
00:29:16,640 --> 00:29:18,780
Those rumors are fabricated.

408
00:29:18,780 --> 00:29:21,100
They're obviously made up

409
00:29:21,100 --> 00:29:24,860
by Chen Huo'e who supposedly came back to life.

410
00:29:25,660 --> 00:29:29,920
But I did see ghost fires quite often in the cemeteries during summer.

411
00:29:29,920 --> 00:29:33,940
My master once told me that it happened because

412
00:29:33,940 --> 00:29:36,520
something imperceptible arising from

413
00:29:36,520 --> 00:29:39,100
the decomposing corpses was ignited in the dry air.

414
00:29:39,100 --> 00:29:42,180
The ghostly shadows must have been created in a similar way.

415
00:29:42,180 --> 00:29:46,240
It's just the shadow of a fast-moving black bird or beast.

416
00:29:47,200 --> 00:29:50,740
I knew it. You know everything.

417
00:29:50,740 --> 00:29:52,780
Did you plan this?

418
00:29:55,320 --> 00:30:00,180
The Jinxiu Workshop should be guarded by the Imperial Guards.

419
00:30:00,180 --> 00:30:03,700
But this afternoon, when the moths smashed themselves

420
00:30:03,700 --> 00:30:07,320
onto the wall "miraculously," the guards did not disperse the crowd.

421
00:30:07,320 --> 00:30:11,620
Jing Lin was there, but he just watched from a distance.

422
00:30:11,620 --> 00:30:13,440
So what?

423
00:30:13,440 --> 00:30:15,540
The Imperial Guards have a lot to investigate.

424
00:30:15,540 --> 00:30:17,700
Ji Fangming has been arrested.

425
00:30:17,700 --> 00:30:20,020
I don't need to bother.

426
00:30:20,020 --> 00:30:23,160
Aren't you waiting?

427
00:30:26,380 --> 00:30:28,620
For what?

428
00:30:28,620 --> 00:30:30,840
For a trend...

429
00:30:30,840 --> 00:30:36,040
that can help you reopen the Jinxiu Workshop case.

430
00:30:48,980 --> 00:30:52,700
You went out for a bit and brought something back.

431
00:30:53,340 --> 00:30:55,400
Be careful!

432
00:30:55,400 --> 00:30:58,240
Don't play with it! Don't do that!

433
00:30:58,240 --> 00:31:02,120
So nervous. Who gave it to you?

434
00:31:02,120 --> 00:31:05,840
I haven't paid for this fan yet. Don't break it!

435
00:31:06,420 --> 00:31:08,204
Really?

436
00:31:27,120 --> 00:31:31,920
Why are you acting weird these days?

437
00:31:34,460 --> 00:31:35,860
Am I?

438
00:31:35,860 --> 00:31:37,636
Yes, you are.

439
00:31:41,720 --> 00:31:45,360
If I forget to prepare the medicinal meal in time, find something to eat.

440
00:31:45,360 --> 00:31:47,820
Don't starve.

441
00:31:47,820 --> 00:31:52,160
And you're not allowed to just talk nonsense out of nowhere

442
00:31:52,160 --> 00:31:54,640
and then assume a frightening pose.

443
00:31:54,640 --> 00:31:57,240
And you're not allowed to suddenlyâ€¦

444
00:32:02,540 --> 00:32:04,424
Suddenly what?

445
00:32:06,940 --> 00:32:09,660
Suddenlyâ€¦

446
00:32:18,380 --> 00:32:20,600
You're not allowed to waste food.

447
00:32:25,440 --> 00:32:27,272
Fine.

448
00:32:29,240 --> 00:32:31,700
I won't.

449
00:32:33,020 --> 00:32:38,620
But you must not do something dangerous like visiting the Jinxiu Workshop at night again.

450
00:32:38,620 --> 00:32:41,560
Luckily, I had someone on guard there tonight.

451
00:32:41,560 --> 00:32:45,280
Otherwise, you could have been in grave danger.

452
00:32:45,280 --> 00:32:49,160
Just this once. Don't do this again.

453
00:32:59,080 --> 00:33:01,000
 What's going on? 

454
00:33:01,000 --> 00:33:02,940
 I feel so dizzy. 

455
00:33:04,360 --> 00:33:07,600
 No way, Pan Chi. 

456
00:33:07,600 --> 00:33:10,740
 This time, you really got me into big trouble. 

457
00:33:12,160 --> 00:33:13,560
Yan Xing.

458
00:33:13,560 --> 00:33:17,840
Take down a cow.

459
00:33:18,520 --> 00:33:20,232
Whatâ€¦

460
00:33:52,727 --> 00:33:58,041
â™«  The night is still long and the moonlight shines in the west window  â™«

461
00:33:58,960 --> 00:34:01,120
You smell so good.

462
00:34:02,583 --> 00:34:03,932
â™«  With one touch, my heart flutters like the shadow of a candle, swaying and trembling  â™«

463
00:34:03,932 --> 00:34:08,791
â™«  With one touch, my heart flutters like the shadow of a candle, swaying and trembling  â™«

464
00:34:08,791 --> 00:34:13,815
â™«  The more one cares, the deeper it's concealed  â™«

465
00:34:13,815 --> 00:34:19,380
â™«  Leaves fall and turn yellow, with a thousand lines of yearning  â™«

466
00:34:19,380 --> 00:34:22,120
Stop taking advantage of me.

467
00:34:23,799 --> 00:34:25,501
â™«  Two hearts collide between dawn and dusk  â™«

468
00:34:25,501 --> 00:34:29,427
â™«  Two hearts collide between dawn and dusk  â™«

469
00:34:29,427 --> 00:34:34,432
â™«  Embraces come unexpectedly  â™«

470
00:34:35,255 --> 00:34:38,155
â™«  I want to be with you, shadows become a pair  â™«

471
00:34:38,155 --> 00:34:42,080
â™«  I want to hold you, staying by my side  â™«

472
00:34:42,080 --> 00:34:46,093
â™«  Passing through the obstruction of a storm  â™«

473
00:34:46,093 --> 00:34:48,878
â™«  I want to be your moonlight  â™«

474
00:34:48,878 --> 00:34:52,605
â™«  To accompany you to every dawn  â™«

475
00:34:52,605 --> 00:34:55,174
â™«  How I wish I could just forget the length of time  â™«

476
00:34:55,174 --> 00:34:59,429
â™«  How I wish I could just forget the length of time  â™«

477
00:34:59,429 --> 00:35:02,184

484
00:35:42,920 --> 00:35:44,656
Not allowed.

485
00:35:53,560 --> 00:35:55,383
Not allowed.

486
00:35:55,383 --> 00:35:58,001
â™«  I want to be with you, shadows become a pair  â™«

487
00:35:58,001 --> 00:36:01,795
â™«  I want to hold you, staying by my side  â™«

493
00:36:19,177 --> 00:36:22,085

494

â™«  I want to be with you, shadows become a pair  â™«

501
00:36:46,080 --> 00:36:48,600
It seems we have to...

502
00:36:52,000 --> 00:36:54,035
pay for this fan.

503
00:36:54,035 --> 00:36:56,712
â™«  I want to accompany you forever  â™«

504

â™«  In this life, I will only keep you in my heart  â™«

507
00:37:37,640 --> 00:37:39,040
Let her sleep.

508
00:37:39,040 --> 00:37:41,000
Don't wake her up.

509
00:37:41,000 --> 00:37:42,724
Understood.

510
00:37:46,960 --> 00:37:49,880
Ji Fangming is outrageous.

511
00:37:49,880 --> 00:37:53,940
His lack of proper conduct is already a grave disrespect.

512
00:37:53,940 --> 00:37:57,760
He even dares to slander Prince Xian and the Princess of Valor

513
00:37:57,760 --> 00:38:01,640
with the old case of the Jinxiu Workshop.

514
00:38:01,640 --> 00:38:04,240
He deserves to die.

515
00:38:05,400 --> 00:38:08,660
Grand Empress Dowager, Ji Fangming surely deserves to die.

516
00:38:08,660 --> 00:38:11,220
But he was definitely instigated by someone.

517
00:38:11,220 --> 00:38:14,640
They used his obsession to spread rumors.

518
00:38:16,280 --> 00:38:18,640
Who did it?

519
00:38:18,640 --> 00:38:22,120
The serial killer committed suicide upon her arrest five years ago.

520
00:38:22,120 --> 00:38:23,560
Chen Huo'e.

521
00:38:23,560 --> 00:38:24,960
What?

522
00:38:24,960 --> 00:38:27,480
A person who has died

523
00:38:27,480 --> 00:38:31,200
can still stir up trouble in Xiang'an City?

524
00:38:32,760 --> 00:38:35,960
I remember you investigated

525
00:38:35,960 --> 00:38:39,100
this case in person, Lai Luozhi.

526
00:38:41,200 --> 00:38:43,960
What exactly happened?

527
00:38:43,960 --> 00:38:45,400
Responding to Grand Empress Dowager.

528
00:38:45,400 --> 00:38:48,200
The case of Chen Huo'e caused panic among the people.

529
00:38:48,200 --> 00:38:51,840
Therefore, I executed her in public after I arrested her.

530
00:38:51,840 --> 00:38:54,560
Half of the Xiang'an citizens were there

531
00:38:54,560 --> 00:38:57,240
and they saw Chen Huo'e taking her own life.

532
00:38:57,240 --> 00:39:01,200
Her corpse was thrown into a mass grave under the people's watch.

533
00:39:01,200 --> 00:39:03,660
- It's justâ€¦ 
 - Just what?

534
00:39:03,660 --> 00:39:09,360
It's just that she had said crazy things about coming back to life.

535
00:39:11,560 --> 00:39:15,660
So you're saying that she has truly come back to life?

536
00:39:15,660 --> 00:39:19,280
Recently, rumors have it that Chen Huo'e has appeared.

537
00:39:19,280 --> 00:39:20,680
And some followers are convinced

538
00:39:20,680 --> 00:39:23,760
that she was Chen Huo'e who had killed herself five years ago.

539
00:39:23,760 --> 00:39:25,280
But in my humble opinion,

540
00:39:25,280 --> 00:39:29,980
someone has been using this to cause trouble and bewitch the people.

541
00:39:31,680 --> 00:39:32,920
My ministers,

542
00:39:32,920 --> 00:39:36,420
Chen Huo'e fabricated miracles to make the people suspect

543
00:39:36,420 --> 00:39:39,400
that the people of the Jinxiu Workshop suffered injustice.

544
00:39:39,400 --> 00:39:41,480
The Imperial Guards

545
00:39:41,480 --> 00:39:45,120
have asked for permission to retry the cases of Chen Huo'e

546
00:39:45,120 --> 00:39:47,400
and the Jinxiu Workshop.

547
00:39:47,400 --> 00:39:49,840
Gentlemen, what are your opinions?

548
00:39:49,840 --> 00:39:52,340
Your Majesty loves the people.

549
00:39:52,340 --> 00:39:56,120
Now that Great Chief Shen intends to retry this case,

550
00:39:56,120 --> 00:39:58,880
I don't see a problem here.

551
00:39:58,880 --> 00:40:02,600
Vice Minister Lai, what do you think?

552
00:40:04,960 --> 00:40:06,560
In my humble opinion,

553
00:40:06,560 --> 00:40:11,140
the case must have been suddenly brought up for a reason.

554
00:40:11,140 --> 00:40:13,240
But I dare not speculate

555
00:40:13,240 --> 00:40:17,560
if the case would disturb the peace of Xiang'an City.

556
00:40:17,560 --> 00:40:20,680
Grand Empress Dowager, I reviewed the previous files

557
00:40:20,680 --> 00:40:23,640
and realized many unresolved mysteries.

558
00:40:23,640 --> 00:40:26,640
Your Majesty has always been caring for the people.

559
00:40:26,640 --> 00:40:31,120
I know it's a tricky issue but I dare not withhold the truth.

560
00:40:33,960 --> 00:40:37,260
Grand Empress Dowager, in my humble opinion, Great Chief Shen is right.

561
00:40:37,260 --> 00:40:41,060
If we can unravel the truth and bring peace to the people,

562
00:40:41,060 --> 00:40:43,160
Your Majesty will surely be pleased.

563
00:40:43,160 --> 00:40:46,320
That's also a way to show Mother Empress's determination to

564
00:40:46,320 --> 00:40:48,400
free people from worries.

565
00:40:48,400 --> 00:40:51,340
"Free people from worries." Well said.

566
00:40:51,340 --> 00:40:55,840
Minister Shen, I will entrust this case solely to you.

567
00:40:55,840 --> 00:40:58,680
You must get to the bottom of it.

568
00:40:58,680 --> 00:41:01,700
I accept the command and will not fail to meet Your Majesty's expectations.

569
00:41:01,700 --> 00:41:05,080
I'll arrest the culprit as soon as possible.

570
00:41:06,720 --> 00:41:11,000
What do you think about Great Chief Shen's request for a thorough investigation of this case?

571
00:41:11,000 --> 00:41:14,680
What happened back then caused panic among the people.

572
00:41:20,680 --> 00:41:23,080
- I shall take my leave. 
 - I shall take my leave.

573
00:41:28,442 --> 00:41:32,320
Your Highness never interferes too much with court affairs.

574
00:41:32,320 --> 00:41:34,680
But you attracted unwanted attention this time.

575
00:41:34,680 --> 00:41:38,320
Sir, I didn't think too much.

576
00:41:38,320 --> 00:41:42,120
I just want to see what Shen Du would do.

577
00:41:43,560 --> 00:41:45,400
Back then, when Princess Runing

578
00:41:45,400 --> 00:41:48,000
was punished for the clothing design,

579
00:41:48,000 --> 00:41:52,020
some people suspected that it was the work of the Princess of Valor.

580
00:41:52,020 --> 00:41:53,680
Now that the case will be retried,

581
00:41:53,680 --> 00:41:56,260
if it turns out to be related to the Princess of Valor,

582
00:41:56,260 --> 00:41:58,280
then it would be great news for us.

583
00:41:58,280 --> 00:42:02,480
We can use them to eliminate adversaries.

584
00:42:02,480 --> 00:42:04,000
You misunderstand.

585
00:42:04,000 --> 00:42:07,200
I only want to find out what happened back then.
