00:00:27,410 --> 00:00:32,000
 "Go Ahead Fearlessly" - Liu Yuning 

3
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:34,942
â™«  Grudges and karma, right and wrong  â™«

4
00:00:34,942 --> 00:00:38,240
â™«  The past hides blood and tears  â™«

5
00:00:38,240 --> 00:00:40,609
â™«  It is hard to catch up after years of separation  â™«

6
00:00:40,609 --> 00:00:44,484
â™«  The truth cannot be fully revealed  â™«

7
00:00:44,484 --> 00:00:47,619
â™«  Fate is full of twists and turns  â™«

8
00:00:47,619 --> 00:00:50,784
â™«  Life and death, fortune and misfortune go hand in hand  â™«

9
00:00:50,784 --> 00:00:55,820
â™«  Obsession is hard to get rid of, keeping the truth 
 and getting rid of the lies, let the wind blow  â™«

10
00:00:55,820 --> 00:01:02,292
â™«  Tossed about by the wind and rain, I will never regret it, 
 I will accompany you for my whole life  â™«

11
00:01:02,292 --> 00:01:08,500
â™«  At least you share my joy and sorrow  â™«

12
00:01:08,500 --> 00:01:14,779
â™«  Unravelling fate, fearlessly, a dream returns  â™«

13
00:01:14,779 --> 00:01:21,092
â™«  The mountains and rivers are bright and beautiful, 
 holding hands, together we return  â™«

14
00:01:21,092 --> 00:01:29,036
â€‹â™«  In this life, my heart returns untainted of dust and ash  â™«

15
00:01:29,036 --> 00:01:37,270
   

16
00:01:37,270 --> 00:01:40,200
   

17
00:01:41,116 --> 00:01:42,440
   

18
00:01:42,440 --> 00:01:45,160
My Lord, Grand Empress Dowager bestowed you the marriage.

19
00:01:45,160 --> 00:01:47,080
Should we make some preparations?

20
00:01:47,080 --> 00:01:49,260
Uncle Zhong, it's not your turn to take action.

21
00:01:49,260 --> 00:01:51,460
With me here, she won't be able to enter the mansion.

22
00:01:51,460 --> 00:01:52,820
It's that trick of yours again?

23
00:01:52,820 --> 00:01:56,180
The immortal method of throwing heads and piercing darts is just to scare people.

24
00:01:56,180 --> 00:01:58,880
This time it's the Grand Empress Dowager who bestowed the marriage.

25
00:01:58,880 --> 00:02:02,580
- Could it beâ€¦? 
 - So what?

26
00:02:02,580 --> 00:02:05,420
As always, we'll scare her away.

27
00:02:12,340 --> 00:02:13,940
Prime Minister Zhang, wellâ€¦

28
00:02:13,940 --> 00:02:16,440
 All right. Stop it. 

29
00:02:16,440 --> 00:02:18,800
 Just do as I said. 

30
00:02:25,340 --> 00:02:28,020
Academician Yan, you are wise.

31
00:02:28,020 --> 00:02:31,460
I believe you won't let me down.

32
00:02:31,460 --> 00:02:33,620
Rest assured, Prime Minister Zhang.

33
00:02:38,400 --> 00:02:40,184
Shut the gate.

34
00:02:43,760 --> 00:02:45,460
Husband.

35
00:02:46,560 --> 00:02:49,440
Prime Minister Zhang has come in person. What's the matter?

36
00:02:49,440 --> 00:02:54,540
Shen Du has never involved himself in factions in the court.

37
00:02:54,540 --> 00:02:56,820
Especially in the competition between Prince Xian and Princess of Valor,

38
00:02:56,820 --> 00:02:58,260
he's always been neutral.

39
00:02:58,260 --> 00:03:00,020
Prime Minister Zhang is the Prince Xian's strategist.

40
00:03:00,020 --> 00:03:04,020
Our third daughter was chosen this time, surely not just for her talents.

41
00:03:04,020 --> 00:03:05,980
Does he want Caiwei to be a spy?

42
00:03:05,980 --> 00:03:08,160
Keep your voice down.

43
00:03:08,760 --> 00:03:11,360
No way. I can't let Caiwei marry him.

44
00:03:11,360 --> 00:03:13,700
Just now, Prime Minister Zhang mentioned to me again

45
00:03:13,700 --> 00:03:15,620
about the matter of the Six Ministries' reselection.

46
00:03:15,620 --> 00:03:19,560
If our third daughter does not marry, I will be sent to defend the frontier desert in the official selection.

47
00:03:19,560 --> 00:03:22,360
And our whole family will have to move.

48
00:03:22,360 --> 00:03:25,060
 Prime Minister Zhang actually threatened Father with exiling his whole family to the desert. 

49
00:03:25,060 --> 00:03:27,020
Master! Madam! Something's wrong.

50
00:03:27,020 --> 00:03:28,880
Third Miss has run away,

51
00:03:28,880 --> 00:03:31,860
saying she was eloping with a scholar named Han Shiyuan.

52
00:03:31,860 --> 00:03:35,140
   

53
00:03:35,140 --> 00:03:38,860
- What a rebellious girl! 
 - Master.

54
00:03:38,860 --> 00:03:40,180
- Husband! 
 - Father.

55
00:03:40,180 --> 00:03:41,380
- Master. 
 - Husband.

56
00:03:41,380 --> 00:03:42,892
Father.

57
00:03:55,200 --> 00:03:57,140
Why are all of you looking at me?

58
00:03:57,140 --> 00:03:59,060
Have you found our third daughter?

59
00:04:03,460 --> 00:04:05,660
If not, hurry up and go look for her.

60
00:04:05,660 --> 00:04:08,480
Even it means to go through Xiang'an, you must find my disobedient girl

61
00:04:08,480 --> 00:04:10,420
and bring her back to me.

62
00:04:11,920 --> 00:04:13,660
Go look for her carefully.

63
00:04:13,660 --> 00:04:15,180
Hurry up.

64
00:04:15,180 --> 00:04:16,824
Wait.

65
00:04:18,200 --> 00:04:19,720
Keep it a secret.

66
00:04:19,720 --> 00:04:23,140
Don't let others know the third miss is missing.

67
00:04:23,140 --> 00:04:25,960
Right. Don't let anyone know the third miss is missing.

68
00:04:25,960 --> 00:04:30,380
Just say that Sixth Miss's rabbit is lost.

69
00:04:30,380 --> 00:04:32,344
 Yes, Madame. 

70
00:04:37,180 --> 00:04:38,900
Sixth Miss.

71
00:04:38,900 --> 00:04:41,700
You often move around outside, so you are quite familiar with the area.

72
00:04:41,700 --> 00:04:43,900
And you have a good relationship with Caiwei.

73
00:04:43,900 --> 00:04:45,880
Let's go out and look for her together.

74
00:04:45,880 --> 00:04:47,840
Okay.

75
00:04:47,840 --> 00:04:51,100
- Then I'll go to look for the rabbit. 
 - Okay.

76
00:06:40,040 --> 00:06:41,920
Sixth Miss Yan.

77
00:06:45,920 --> 00:06:48,620
Are you ladies of the Yan family not allowed to go home?

78
00:06:48,620 --> 00:06:51,120
Why are you hanging out all day?

79
00:06:52,960 --> 00:06:55,060
Great Chief, please move aside.

80
00:06:55,060 --> 00:06:57,640
My rabbit is lost. I need to go look for it.

81
00:06:57,640 --> 00:06:59,440
Really?

82
00:06:59,440 --> 00:07:02,560
So your rabbit is lost.

83
00:07:02,560 --> 00:07:05,860
The gate of Yan Mansion has been shut all day today.

84
00:07:05,860 --> 00:07:09,440
I thought you were busily preparing for the wedding.

85
00:07:10,060 --> 00:07:13,080
So you were just looking for a rabbit.

86
00:07:15,040 --> 00:07:18,160
Great Chief, if you are finished talking, I will keep looking for it.

87
00:07:18,160 --> 00:07:20,920
Then you must find it.

88
00:07:21,640 --> 00:07:24,840
Tomorrow is the wedding between me and your third sister.

89
00:07:24,840 --> 00:07:29,200
At that time, I am very much looking forward to seeing you

90
00:07:29,200 --> 00:07:32,400
coming to the wedding with the rabbit.

91
00:07:44,720 --> 00:07:48,320
Great Chief, may I ask you a favor?

92
00:07:48,320 --> 00:07:50,424
Ask me a favor?

93
00:07:53,040 --> 00:07:57,400
Except for the prisoners in the cell who want to die, in the whole of Great Cang,

94
00:07:57,400 --> 00:08:01,600
I'm afraid there's no other one who wants to ask me for a favor.

95
00:08:02,680 --> 00:08:06,220
Great Chief, please break the engagement with my third sister.

96
00:08:13,640 --> 00:08:16,040
Do you know what you're saying?

97
00:08:16,040 --> 00:08:17,620
Yes.

98
00:08:17,620 --> 00:08:20,720
Great Chief, please cancel the engagement with my third sister.

99
00:08:20,720 --> 00:08:23,100
Although you have no official rank,

100
00:08:23,100 --> 00:08:25,520
at least you're a literate clerk.

101
00:08:25,520 --> 00:08:29,160
Don't you know what "heaven's mandate cannot be opposed" means?

102
00:08:30,920 --> 00:08:33,240
The Grand Empress Dowager bestowed this wedding.

103
00:08:33,240 --> 00:08:35,720
There's no way to cancel it.

104
00:08:37,799 --> 00:08:41,280
The Grand Empress Dowager values you much,

105
00:08:41,280 --> 00:08:44,060
so she wants to give you a good match.

106
00:08:44,060 --> 00:08:45,960
Yes.

107
00:08:45,960 --> 00:08:48,780
The Grand Empress Dowager has meticulously selected,

108
00:08:48,780 --> 00:08:50,820
and Prime Minister Zhang has guaranteed it.

109
00:08:50,820 --> 00:08:53,680
I believe I will be a good match with your third sister.

110
00:08:53,680 --> 00:08:57,560
That's the Grand Empress Dowager not knowing what the ladies of the Yan family are like.

111
00:08:57,560 --> 00:08:59,180
Seeing how rude and disrespectful I am,

112
00:08:59,180 --> 00:09:04,280
you should know my third sister and you will definitely not be a good match.

113
00:09:08,540 --> 00:09:11,120
Are you saying

114
00:09:11,120 --> 00:09:14,000
your third sister's talents are all fake?

115
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:17,600
Deceiving the world to steal fame is a crime against the sovereign.

116
00:09:17,600 --> 00:09:19,980
Iâ€¦ I'm talking about me.

117
00:09:19,980 --> 00:09:22,020
You indeed are rude and disrespectful.

118
00:09:22,020 --> 00:09:24,440
But I'm not marrying you.

119
00:09:24,440 --> 00:09:29,740
It is your third sister. You are such an impolite half-sister.

120
00:09:30,960 --> 00:09:33,120
But you've never met my third sister.

121
00:09:33,120 --> 00:09:35,660
Aren't you afraid that you will not be in love with each other

122
00:09:35,660 --> 00:09:38,440
and end up being a couple with different dreams?

123
00:09:39,080 --> 00:09:40,620
So what?

124
00:09:40,620 --> 00:09:43,220
How can it be okay?

125
00:09:44,080 --> 00:09:47,160
One should always be with the one he loves.

126
00:09:47,160 --> 00:09:50,360
Treating each other with mutual respect and valuing each other.

127
00:09:50,360 --> 00:09:53,160
This is what makes a lifetime happy.

128
00:10:03,600 --> 00:10:04,960
It doesn't matter.

129
00:10:04,960 --> 00:10:06,504
Youâ€¦

130
00:10:09,660 --> 00:10:12,380
You are so silly and unreasonable.

131
00:10:12,380 --> 00:10:14,280
How dare you!

132
00:10:14,280 --> 00:10:16,040
Shen Du,

133
00:10:17,020 --> 00:10:20,580
even if I don't want to believe the rumors from outside,

134
00:10:20,580 --> 00:10:23,140
but look at you now.

135
00:10:23,140 --> 00:10:26,180
You are talking mean, acting outrageous,

136
00:10:26,180 --> 00:10:29,080
being ruthless, and unreasonable.

137
00:10:29,080 --> 00:10:32,020
Even if my third sister doesn't have someone she likes,

138
00:10:32,020 --> 00:10:34,580
why would she marry you?

139
00:10:51,640 --> 00:10:56,660
 Treating each other with mutual respect and valuing each other.  

140
00:10:58,240 --> 00:11:03,600
These things are already far from me now.

141
00:11:27,060 --> 00:11:28,580
Mother.

142
00:11:28,580 --> 00:11:34,500
Someday, I will move you to the noblest cemetery in the world, 
    

143
00:11:34,500 --> 00:11:37,920
where you will be worshipped.

144
00:11:39,980 --> 00:11:43,440
Master, everything is ready.

145
00:11:59,620 --> 00:12:03,180
Great Chief, although Sixth Miss Yan doesn't speak nicely,

146
00:12:03,180 --> 00:12:06,120
don't you also wish to cancel this engagement?

147
00:12:06,120 --> 00:12:07,680
Since we haven't scared them away yet,

148
00:12:07,680 --> 00:12:09,960
and they are already asking for a cancel,

149
00:12:09,960 --> 00:12:12,840
why don't we just go with the flow?

150
00:12:12,840 --> 00:12:15,280
Of course, this wedding can't be completed.

151
00:12:16,860 --> 00:12:18,780
But I...

152
00:12:19,910 --> 00:12:22,350
shouldn't be the one to cancel it.

153
00:12:22,920 --> 00:12:23,920
Right, right.

154
00:12:23,920 --> 00:12:27,560
Grand Empress Dowager bestowed you the marriage, so you naturally should be grateful.

155
00:12:27,560 --> 00:12:30,480
Still, the Yan family must be the ones to cancel the engagement.

156
00:12:30,480 --> 00:12:34,160
According to the scouts, Third Miss of the Yan family

157
00:12:34,160 --> 00:12:36,980
has eloped with that scholar, yet has not been found.

158
00:12:36,980 --> 00:12:40,940
Even if they don't cancel the engagement, then tomorrow's bridal pickup is naturally canceled. Right?

159
00:12:40,940 --> 00:12:42,320
They are in the wrong,

160
00:12:42,320 --> 00:12:43,860
and to the Grand Empress Dowager,

161
00:12:43,860 --> 00:12:47,260
Prime Minister Zhang will naturally have to find a way to smooth things over.

162
00:12:48,900 --> 00:12:51,560
How can we only watch half of a play?

163
00:12:51,560 --> 00:12:54,500
Where the bride is, that's the Yan family's business.

164
00:12:54,500 --> 00:12:58,860
Tomorrow morning, I will naturally send a team to pick up the bride.

165
00:13:05,180 --> 00:13:07,280
   

166
00:13:17,616 --> 00:13:21,470
   

167
00:13:35,847 --> 00:13:38,560
   

168
00:13:42,780 --> 00:13:44,920
Everyone,

169
00:13:44,920 --> 00:13:47,020
you have been working in the Yan Mansion for years.

170
00:13:47,020 --> 00:13:50,000
Now that we have encountered such a disaster,

171
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:53,400
I'm afraid Heaven wants to doom our Yan family.

172
00:13:53,400 --> 00:13:58,260
I have prepared some money for you, so you can find a new place to settle.

173
00:14:05,930 --> 00:14:07,830
   

174
00:14:17,820 --> 00:14:20,820
I have already finished the will.

175
00:14:20,820 --> 00:14:25,760
Mother, I don't want to die yet. Mother.

176
00:14:29,460 --> 00:14:31,416
Mother.

177
00:14:32,840 --> 00:14:35,080
Mother.

178
00:14:37,920 --> 00:14:40,400
- Mother. 
 - All right.

179
00:14:40,400 --> 00:14:42,424
I'll be the bride.

180
00:14:47,600 --> 00:14:48,800
 What time is it already? 

181
00:14:48,800 --> 00:14:50,480
 Why hasn't the bride come out yet? 

182
00:14:50,480 --> 00:14:53,140
 We're going to miss the auspicious time! 

183
00:15:17,388 --> 00:15:25,117
â™«  May you also look up to see the brilliant stars and moon  â™«

184
00:15:27,704 --> 00:15:35,704
â™«  Among countless others, I've found only you  â™«

185
00:15:35,704 --> 00:15:40,075
â™«  Time is fleeting and fate is shallow  â™«

186
00:15:40,075 --> 00:15:45,929
â™«  The winter in warm memories  â™«

187
00:15:45,929 --> 00:15:49,981
â™«  Never mind the destined solitary fate  â™«

188
00:15:49,981 --> 00:15:54,699
â™«  Blazing a lifetime of magnificence  â™«

189
00:15:56,116 --> 00:16:00,434
â™«  I have waited until time bloomed into flowers  â™«

190
00:16:00,434 --> 00:16:06,110
â™«  The ice and snow slowly melting  â™«

191
00:16:06,110 --> 00:16:10,478
â™«  I hear those gentle words  â™«

192
00:16:10,478 --> 00:16:15,892
â™«  He said he loves her  â™«

193
00:16:15,892 --> 00:16:20,657
â™«  The flower in the mirror, the moon in the water, present in my dreams  â™«

194
00:16:20,657 --> 00:16:25,724
â™«  Itâ€™s not illusory glamor  â™«

195
00:16:25,724 --> 00:16:28,580
â™«  Why fear the flying sand on the road ahead  â™«

196
00:16:28,580 --> 00:16:31,180
â™«  Chasing time, riding a white horse  â™«

197
00:16:31,180 --> 00:16:32,600
Sixth Miss!

198
00:16:32,600 --> 00:16:35,860
Sixth Miss, no way!

199
00:16:35,860 --> 00:16:37,560
Sixth Miss!

200
00:16:37,560 --> 00:16:39,600
This won't work out.

201
00:16:39,600 --> 00:16:41,840
Think about that White Ghost.

202
00:16:41,840 --> 00:16:44,680
He's someone in the Shen Mansion who crawled out from a pile of dead bodies.

203
00:16:44,680 --> 00:16:46,480
Could you live a good life after marrying him?

204
00:16:46,480 --> 00:16:48,560
Run. Take this.

205
00:16:48,560 --> 00:16:51,000
You know people in the Ministry of Justice.

206
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:53,740
When the time comes, find a place to hide for three months.

207
00:16:53,740 --> 00:16:57,220
Return home after this period passes.

208
00:16:57,220 --> 00:16:58,700
Don't worry about me.

209
00:16:58,700 --> 00:17:03,040
Your father is just a paper tiger, he can't do anything bad to me.

210
00:17:03,040 --> 00:17:07,540
At worst, I'll serve him well for the rest of my life.

211
00:17:07,540 --> 00:17:11,870
Serving him tea and water, massaging his shoulders and legs.

212
00:17:14,260 --> 00:17:18,280
If it really doesn't work out, you can just divorce me.

213
00:17:18,280 --> 00:17:20,939
I'll go and sing opera again.

214
00:17:20,939 --> 00:17:22,920
I can support the two of us.

215
00:17:22,920 --> 00:17:28,000
Mother, which troupe would take in an elderly actress like you?

216
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:29,280
Although I am a concubine's daughter,

217
00:17:29,280 --> 00:17:32,960
under your protection since childhood, I have not suffered much.

218
00:17:32,960 --> 00:17:34,740
My third sister has been nice to me.

219
00:17:34,740 --> 00:17:37,100
I was unwilling to practice the female arts of needlework,

220
00:17:37,100 --> 00:17:38,740
I was eager to apply for the position of a female official.

221
00:17:38,740 --> 00:17:41,840
It was my third sister who knelt for an entire night in the ancestral hall for me.

222
00:17:41,840 --> 00:17:43,460
You child!

223
00:17:43,460 --> 00:17:45,940
You just remember the good in others.

224
00:17:46,580 --> 00:17:48,460
I am part of the Yan family,

225
00:17:48,460 --> 00:17:50,960
naturally, I can't watch the Yan family suffer.

226
00:17:50,960 --> 00:17:54,240
My third sister doesn't wish to marry, because she has Young Master Han in her heart.

227
00:17:54,240 --> 00:17:55,580
I have no one in my heart. So I shall marry on her behalf.

228
00:17:55,580 --> 00:17:57,560
I have no one in my heart. So I shall marry on her behalf.

229
00:17:58,380 --> 00:18:02,080
Silly girl. It is not that simple.

230
00:18:02,080 --> 00:18:05,040
Mother, don't worry.

231
00:18:05,040 --> 00:18:07,980
I have seen many dead bodies at the Ministry of Justice.

232
00:18:07,980 --> 00:18:10,820
Even the White Ghost can't scare me.

233
00:18:10,820 --> 00:18:13,780
Besides, he's still a human.

234
00:18:13,780 --> 00:18:16,520
Can he really lure me to the underworld?

235
00:18:21,200 --> 00:18:22,932
All right.

236
00:18:38,780 --> 00:18:40,504
Father.

237
00:18:43,660 --> 00:18:45,356
Mother.

238
00:18:46,880 --> 00:18:49,860
Please take good care of my mother for me.

239
00:18:49,860 --> 00:18:52,940
I am leaving.

240
00:19:32,346 --> 00:19:36,680
   

241
00:19:41,360 --> 00:19:44,220
Pick up the bride!

242
00:19:45,440 --> 00:19:48,370
   

243
00:19:48,370 --> 00:19:51,090
   

244
00:20:11,404 --> 00:20:15,140
Great Chief, before the wedding ceremony, the bride and groom should not meet.

245
00:20:15,140 --> 00:20:16,860
The bride dropping the bridal sedan chair halfway will bring bad luck.

246
00:20:16,860 --> 00:20:19,540
Moreover, as the groom, you haven't even changed into your wedding attire.

247
00:20:19,540 --> 00:20:23,380
Enough with the nonsense! We'll follow the Imperial Guards' rules.

248
00:20:23,380 --> 00:20:25,480
The Great Chief decides what to do.

249
00:20:25,480 --> 00:20:27,152
Wellâ€¦

250
00:20:31,720 --> 00:20:33,556
My wife.

251
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:38,040
Let me take a look...

252
00:20:40,470 --> 00:20:42,300
   

253
00:20:43,180 --> 00:20:49,580
....at the virtuous lady of the Yan family who has learned a lot.

254
00:21:05,840 --> 00:21:08,260
This virtuous lady...

255
00:21:12,360 --> 00:21:14,380
is me.

256
00:21:31,300 --> 00:21:34,500
Great Chief, are you going to kill your wife in public?

257
00:21:42,260 --> 00:21:46,340
Don't forget this marriage is bestowed by the Grand Empress Dowager.

258
00:21:46,340 --> 00:21:49,940
Although I don't have any official rank, and I am not an official,

259
00:21:49,940 --> 00:21:52,840
at the very least, I am a clerk in the Ministry of Justice.

260
00:21:52,840 --> 00:21:56,020
This is not a crime scene, nor is there a suspect holding anyone hostage.

261
00:21:56,020 --> 00:22:02,420
Even if you are the Great Chief, you cannot just kill an innocent clerk.

262
00:22:10,040 --> 00:22:11,772
Really?

263
00:22:20,800 --> 00:22:22,800
Since when...

264
00:22:26,060 --> 00:22:29,000
could a fly be a clerk?

265
00:22:34,900 --> 00:22:37,760
You don't need to humiliate me like this.

266
00:22:37,760 --> 00:22:40,680
Since you're so upset about this marriage,

267
00:22:40,680 --> 00:22:43,020
why don't you kill me now?

268
00:22:46,940 --> 00:22:48,884
Don't rush me.

269
00:22:50,880 --> 00:22:55,500
This sword today hasn't chopped your neck,

270
00:22:57,140 --> 00:22:59,140
but very soon,

271
00:23:01,760 --> 00:23:05,620
it will leave you with no way out.

272
00:23:21,420 --> 00:23:23,280
Sixth Miss Yan is really bold,

273
00:23:23,280 --> 00:23:25,720
daring to marry for her third sister.

274
00:23:27,680 --> 00:23:29,400
This is a crime of deceiving the emperor.

275
00:23:29,400 --> 00:23:32,020
The Grand Empress Dowager only said to bestow a marriage to a lady from the Yan family.

276
00:23:32,020 --> 00:23:35,900
The Grand Empress Dowager doesn't care which lady at all.

277
00:23:35,900 --> 00:23:38,860
- But youâ€¦ 
 - I care even less.

278
00:23:38,860 --> 00:23:41,040
She will be driven away sooner or later.

279
00:23:41,040 --> 00:23:44,140
There aren't many interesting rabbits in the Yan family.

280
00:23:44,140 --> 00:23:47,340
A bold one is intriguing.

281
00:23:47,340 --> 00:23:51,500
It's rare that she is not only bold,

282
00:23:52,080 --> 00:23:54,700
but also smart.

283
00:24:01,780 --> 00:24:03,510
Sixth Miss.

284
00:24:04,100 --> 00:24:05,970
Sixth Miss.

285
00:24:07,380 --> 00:24:09,220
Sixth Miss.

286
00:24:09,720 --> 00:24:11,860
Chuichui.

287
00:24:11,860 --> 00:24:14,900
Sixth Miss, it really is you.

288
00:24:14,900 --> 00:24:19,200
I heard that your third sister was to marry today and wanted to find you to join in the excitement.

289
00:24:19,200 --> 00:24:22,080
But upon arriving at the Yan Mansion, I saw Lady Jin crying at the gate,

290
00:24:22,080 --> 00:24:24,100
saying that it was you who was to be married.

291
00:24:24,100 --> 00:24:27,000
Sixth Miss, are you unwilling?

292
00:24:28,240 --> 00:24:32,200
But the groom is Shen Du.

293
00:24:32,680 --> 00:24:35,010
He's no longer Shen Du,

294
00:24:35,620 --> 00:24:38,460
but the cruel and ruthless White Ghost.

295
00:24:40,680 --> 00:24:43,940
- Chuichui, don't worry and go back. 
 - No way.

296
00:24:43,940 --> 00:24:46,900
How can I just watch you falling into the hands of the White Ghost?

297
00:24:46,900 --> 00:24:50,900
I'll go with you. I will be with you.

298
00:24:53,708 --> 00:24:56,940
- Terrible. 
 - What's wrong? Take your time.

299
00:24:56,940 --> 00:25:00,065
The bride has arrived. 
    

300
00:25:00,065 --> 00:25:02,260
Bride?

301
00:25:21,140 --> 00:25:23,920
What's the special family rule?

302
00:25:23,920 --> 00:25:27,160
The Shen Mansion is made to look like a mourning hall.

303
00:25:27,160 --> 00:25:29,980
It doesn't look like it's going to have a wedding at all.

304
00:25:30,800 --> 00:25:33,300
There are so many white lanterns.

305
00:25:47,860 --> 00:25:51,290
Madam, upon your first arrival at the Shen Mansion,

306
00:25:51,290 --> 00:25:55,320
the servants will never dare to neglect you.

307
00:25:55,320 --> 00:26:00,260
This wedding is all about the right timing, location, and people.

308
00:26:00,260 --> 00:26:04,640
A few days ago, we invited someone to tell the fortunes of you two.

309
00:26:04,640 --> 00:26:10,020
So today, it is not suitable for wedding celebrations.

310
00:26:12,940 --> 00:26:16,400
It's okay. As you please.

311
00:26:16,400 --> 00:26:18,056
Please.

312
00:26:30,320 --> 00:26:35,620
Because the Great Chief has lived alone for years, the main chamber lacks the air of auspiciousness,

313
00:26:35,620 --> 00:26:37,840
so it is not suitable as a bridal chamber.

314
00:26:37,840 --> 00:26:41,460
It could easily lead to disaster.

315
00:26:41,460 --> 00:26:43,800
A new room has been specially prepared for you.

316
00:26:43,800 --> 00:26:47,700
You should rest early and wait for the Great Chief to return.

317
00:26:47,700 --> 00:26:50,160
Don't bully others too much!

318
00:26:52,020 --> 00:26:53,812
It's okay.

319
00:26:54,960 --> 00:26:57,060
Please lead the way.

320
00:26:57,060 --> 00:26:59,200
Please.

321
00:26:59,200 --> 00:27:01,200
Butler Shen.

322
00:27:02,420 --> 00:27:05,860
I wonder if you remember what my birthdate is.

323
00:27:05,860 --> 00:27:07,504
Wellâ€¦

324
00:27:12,480 --> 00:27:15,820
I know you don't want to say my birthdate in public.

325
00:27:15,820 --> 00:27:18,100
Thank you for your consideration.

326
00:27:19,980 --> 00:27:21,668
Please.

327
00:28:00,740 --> 00:28:03,480
Chuichui, have some preserved fruit.

328
00:28:03,480 --> 00:28:05,860
Are you still in the mood to eat?

329
00:28:07,640 --> 00:28:11,500
 Madam, wish you two to have a child soon. 

330
00:28:13,700 --> 00:28:16,160
Spread it now?

331
00:28:16,160 --> 00:28:19,780
Did you never even consider that Sixth Miss would marry into the family?

332
00:28:22,220 --> 00:28:25,880
Chuichui, don't make it difficult for them.

333
00:28:38,080 --> 00:28:40,680
They're being ridiculous.

334
00:28:40,680 --> 00:28:44,620
They probably thought I might run off halfway.

335
00:28:44,620 --> 00:28:47,160
But this is so absurd.

336
00:28:47,160 --> 00:28:49,580
It's nothing. Just some courtesy.

337
00:28:49,580 --> 00:28:53,340
Empty courtesy? Your family has suffered a loss.

338
00:29:03,860 --> 00:29:07,420
I've heard that what Shen Du sent to your family

339
00:29:07,420 --> 00:29:10,380
were all just for show, none of them was valuable.

340
00:29:10,380 --> 00:29:11,992
Wellâ€¦

341
00:29:20,200 --> 00:29:23,080
You might as well marry into an ordinary family.

342
00:29:23,080 --> 00:29:24,720
At least that would be sincere.

343
00:29:24,720 --> 00:29:30,160
People would value much on their weddings, but you got nothing.

344
00:29:30,160 --> 00:29:32,320
And you can still smile now?

345
00:29:34,760 --> 00:29:39,200
Since he doesn't want to marry, then I insist on getting married.

346
00:29:46,700 --> 00:29:48,410
   

347
00:29:49,700 --> 00:29:53,020
Great Chief, it's terrible! There's news from the Imperial Guards up ahead.

348
00:29:55,440 --> 00:29:56,840
That bride is simply outrageous.

349
00:29:56,840 --> 00:29:58,300
Not only did she not leave, she actually came.

350
00:29:58,300 --> 00:30:01,080
She should already be at the Shen Mansion now.

351
00:30:01,080 --> 00:30:02,740
It is indeed Sixth Miss Yan.

352
00:30:02,740 --> 00:30:06,700
The key is that no one thought this wedding would actually happen, so nothing was prepared.

353
00:30:06,700 --> 00:30:11,560
But she went to the venue to set up and offer suggestions.

354
00:30:12,680 --> 00:30:14,480
Let her be.

355
00:30:19,240 --> 00:30:22,320
Previously, there were many ladies who wanted to marry into the Shen Mansion.

356
00:30:22,320 --> 00:30:25,880
But with some tricks, they ran away in an instant.

357
00:30:25,880 --> 00:30:28,200
Who would dare to enter the bridal chamber after seeing your sword?

358
00:30:28,200 --> 00:30:30,920
After entering the mansion, Butler Shen deliberately withheld her dowry.

359
00:30:30,920 --> 00:30:33,020
Not only was she not angry, she still wants to get married.

360
00:30:33,020 --> 00:30:36,320
This woman is well-trained, and rises to the challenge.

361
00:30:36,320 --> 00:30:40,080
Prime Minister Zhang sending her here is definitely a big conspiracy. 
    

362
00:30:42,680 --> 00:30:46,460
If you can tell, then it's not a conspiracy at all.

363
00:30:51,360 --> 00:30:53,820
This rabbit...

364
00:30:56,140 --> 00:30:58,440
Compared to those in the past,

365
00:30:59,560 --> 00:31:02,620
is indeed much more intriguing.

366
00:31:09,140 --> 00:31:11,180
The matchmakerâ€¦

367
00:31:12,100 --> 00:31:13,320
Great Chief, rest assured.

368
00:31:13,320 --> 00:31:16,400
I have already given a heads-up to the bridal pickup team.

369
00:31:16,400 --> 00:31:23,180
Now everyone will only think that your marriage went smoothly and the wedding is done.

370
00:31:46,240 --> 00:31:49,420
Now I understand why Shen Du is known as the White Ghost.

371
00:31:49,420 --> 00:31:51,640
Just look at these.

372
00:31:51,640 --> 00:31:53,480
In broad daylight, it's like a memorial hall.

373
00:31:53,480 --> 00:31:56,920
When evening comes, it is still as brightly lit as day.

374
00:31:56,920 --> 00:32:01,000
Could it be to illuminate the underworld to guide the ghosts?

375
00:32:02,440 --> 00:32:07,520
Perhaps he's afraid of ghosts knocking at midnight.

376
00:32:11,420 --> 00:32:13,040
Sixth Miss.

377
00:32:13,040 --> 00:32:17,520
Now, do you really hate the White Ghost?

378
00:32:19,320 --> 00:32:22,660
I was silly in my youth, thinking he was a nice guy.

379
00:32:22,660 --> 00:32:25,420
But after these past days, I've seen through him now.

380
00:32:25,420 --> 00:32:27,380
Then he said those words when he stopped the sedanâ€¦

381
00:32:27,380 --> 00:32:31,380
I think he didn't want me to enter the mansion, so he wanted to scare me away.

382
00:32:31,380 --> 00:32:33,460
Then what will you do?

383
00:32:33,460 --> 00:32:34,660
Don't worry.

384
00:32:34,660 --> 00:32:37,840
After all, it's a marriage bestowed by the Grand Empress Dowager.

385
00:32:37,840 --> 00:32:40,420
He won't lay a hand on me that soon.

386
00:32:40,420 --> 00:32:43,860
I will be careful and cautious, taking it one day at a time.

387
00:32:43,860 --> 00:32:47,000
I must hold on until the court decides on the personnel for external appointments,

388
00:32:47,000 --> 00:32:49,440
so my family won't be exiled to the frontier.

389
00:32:49,440 --> 00:32:51,080
This is not a marriage.

390
00:32:51,080 --> 00:32:53,280
You are entering a den of demons.

391
00:32:53,280 --> 00:32:57,300
Seeking life in the underworld is not that easy.

392
00:32:57,300 --> 00:32:59,340
It's getting late, you should head back

393
00:32:59,340 --> 00:33:01,380
or your father will be anxious.

394
00:33:01,380 --> 00:33:03,680
I won't go. I want to stay here with you.

395
00:33:03,680 --> 00:33:06,720
Can you come to stay with me every day?

396
00:33:06,720 --> 00:33:09,480
I can't get you involved.

397
00:33:09,480 --> 00:33:14,180
Rest assured. Tonight, he will definitely put on an airs of neglecting me and despising me.

398
00:33:14,180 --> 00:33:16,460
He won't enter my room.

399
00:34:32,000 --> 00:34:34,000
What are you doing here?

400
00:35:18,000 --> 00:35:20,600
This is the Shen Mansion.

401
00:35:20,600 --> 00:35:23,100
And tonight is my wedding night.

402
00:35:23,100 --> 00:35:25,400
Why can't I come?

403
00:35:28,200 --> 00:35:30,000
But youâ€¦

404
00:35:31,200 --> 00:35:34,600
As the lady of the Yan family,

405
00:35:34,600 --> 00:35:37,700
you are praised for your talents,

406
00:35:37,700 --> 00:35:39,600
with knowledge of the past and present.

407
00:35:39,600 --> 00:35:44,100
Your reputation as a virtuous lady is known throughout Xiang'an.

408
00:35:44,700 --> 00:35:49,500
I wonder if what I mentioned is you.

409
00:35:54,800 --> 00:35:56,400
It's a match.

410
00:35:56,400 --> 00:35:59,200
Of course, the Grand Empress Dowager thought

411
00:35:59,200 --> 00:36:03,000
I would be extremely well-matched with you.

412
00:36:03,000 --> 00:36:05,400
Otherwise, why would she bestow a marriage?

413
00:36:06,100 --> 00:36:08,600
Great Chief, if you are dissatisfied with me,

414
00:36:08,600 --> 00:36:11,000
then just divorce me.

415
00:36:18,120 --> 00:36:20,800
The thoughts in my wife's head...

416
00:36:22,360 --> 00:36:25,160
are the same as your face.

417
00:36:27,100 --> 00:36:29,500
You are dreaming too much.

418
00:36:54,560 --> 00:36:57,360
What a pretty lady you are.

419
00:36:59,480 --> 00:37:02,800
I will definitely cherish you,

420
00:37:02,800 --> 00:37:05,840
why would I divorce you?

421
00:37:14,100 --> 00:37:18,500
I have never seen a bride running around before the wedding ceremony.

422
00:37:18,500 --> 00:37:21,200
If you don't want to

423
00:37:21,200 --> 00:37:26,100
accidentally break a leg or lose an arm in the Shen Mansion,

424
00:37:26,100 --> 00:37:28,600
then remember to behave yourself.

425
00:37:56,900 --> 00:37:59,600
Husband, you are right.

426
00:37:59,600 --> 00:38:01,800
Husband,

427
00:38:01,800 --> 00:38:03,800
now that I have married you,

428
00:38:03,800 --> 00:38:08,000
I must naturally do whatever I should well,

429
00:38:08,000 --> 00:38:13,100
to serve you well... perfectly.

430
00:38:17,200 --> 00:38:21,500
Just because of this, you want to flirt with me?

431
00:39:01,600 --> 00:39:04,300
Since you say to serve me well,

432
00:39:04,300 --> 00:39:07,200
then let me tell you three things.

433
00:39:09,000 --> 00:39:14,400
First, don't try to be the real Madam Shen.

434
00:39:14,400 --> 00:39:18,400
Between you and me, we are in name only.

435
00:39:18,400 --> 00:39:24,600
Second, don't expect any information from me.

436
00:39:24,600 --> 00:39:28,000
I know what Prime Minister Zhang sent you for.

437
00:39:31,000 --> 00:39:37,000
Third, you are not the wife I want to marry,

438
00:39:37,000 --> 00:39:40,500
don't try to survive in the Shen Mansion.

439
00:40:28,500 --> 00:40:32,600
My Lord, have you seen Madam?

440
00:40:33,200 --> 00:40:34,700
About the wedding ceremonyâ€¦

441
00:40:34,700 --> 00:40:36,600
Let's regard it as completed.

442
00:40:36,600 --> 00:40:40,000
Wellâ€¦ The west wing roomâ€¦

443
00:40:45,200 --> 00:40:46,800
Just let her stay there.

444
00:40:46,800 --> 00:40:49,700
Great Chief.

445
00:40:50,500 --> 00:40:52,400
Ming Hall is on fire.

446
00:40:55,000 --> 00:40:57,200
- Great Chief. 
 - Why did Ming Hall catch fire?

447
00:40:57,200 --> 00:40:59,600
Someone set himself on fire in Ming Hall, resulting in a fire.

448
00:40:59,600 --> 00:41:01,400
The person who set himself on fire has been burned beyond recognition.

449
00:41:01,400 --> 00:41:04,400
Send more men to ensure the safety of the palace.

450
00:41:04,400 --> 00:41:07,500
Find out who that guy is. Nothing can be left out.

451
00:41:07,500 --> 00:41:09,000
Yes.

452
00:41:22,200 --> 00:41:23,600
 Why won't you let me see her? 

453
00:41:23,600 --> 00:41:25,400
 I am the female official of the Ministry of Justice. 

454
00:41:25,400 --> 00:41:28,800
 I came here with her yesterday. 

455
00:41:28,800 --> 00:41:30,200
 We cannot let you in, Miss. 

456
00:41:30,200 --> 00:41:31,400
 - Without the butler's instructions... 
 - Please. 

457
00:41:31,400 --> 00:41:34,200
 - ...we cannot let you in. 
 - Yes. 

458
00:41:34,200 --> 00:41:35,500
- Chuichui. 
 - You can't go in.

459
00:41:35,500 --> 00:41:38,900
Sixth Miss, it's terrible!

460
00:41:40,400 --> 00:41:42,300
- Madam. 
 - Madam.

461
00:41:46,400 --> 00:41:50,000
In the bamboo forest of Ximing Temple, a couple of bodies were found nearby.

462
00:41:51,100 --> 00:41:53,200
The bodies look so weird.

463
00:41:53,200 --> 00:41:55,200
The Ministry of Justice and the inspector have already sent people there.

464
00:41:55,200 --> 00:41:57,200
- Let's go. 
 - Let's go.

465
