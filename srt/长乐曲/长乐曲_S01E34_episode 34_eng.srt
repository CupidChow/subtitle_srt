00:00:27,340 --> 00:00:31,980
 "Go Ahead Fearlessly" - Liu Yuning 

3
00:00:31,980 --> 00:00:35,024
â™«  Grudges and karma, right and wrong  â™«

4
00:00:35,024 --> 00:00:38,322
â™«  The past hides blood and tears  â™«

5
00:00:38,322 --> 00:00:40,591
â™«  It is hard to catch up after years of separation  â™«

6
00:00:40,591 --> 00:00:44,566
â™«  The truth cannot be fully revealed  â™«

7
00:00:44,566 --> 00:00:47,601
â™«  Fate is full of twists and turns  â™«

8
00:00:47,601 --> 00:00:50,866
â™«  Life and death, fortune and misfortune go hand in hand  â™«

9
00:00:50,866 --> 00:00:55,902
â™«  Obsession is hard to get rid of, keeping the truth 
 and getting rid of the lies, let the wind blow  â™«

10
00:00:55,902 --> 00:01:02,274
â™«  Tossed about by the wind and rain, I will never regret it, 
 I will accompany you for my whole life  â™«

11
00:01:02,274 --> 00:01:08,582
â™«  At least you share my joy and sorrow  â™«

12
00:01:08,582 --> 00:01:14,861
â™«  Unravelling fate, fearlessly, a dream returns  â™«

13
00:01:14,861 --> 00:01:21,174
â™«  The mountains and rivers are bright and beautiful, 
 holding hands, together we return  â™«

14
00:01:21,174 --> 00:01:29,018
â™«  In this life, my heart returns untainted of dust and ash  â™«

15
00:01:29,018 --> 00:01:37,252
   

16
00:01:37,252 --> 00:01:40,287
   

17
00:01:51,720 --> 00:01:54,600
Look, like this.

18
00:01:54,600 --> 00:01:56,468
Squeeze it.

19
00:02:01,240 --> 00:02:02,720
Why can't I close it?

20
00:02:02,720 --> 00:02:04,440
Like this.

21
00:02:43,850 --> 00:02:47,528
â™«  Embracing each other, how serious we are about our love  â™«

22
00:02:47,528 --> 00:02:51,298
â™«  Every moment is treasured  â™«

23
00:02:51,298 --> 00:02:55,957
â™«  From dawn to dusk  â™«

24
00:02:55,957 --> 00:02:58,890
â™«  You and I, forever inseparable  â™«

25
00:02:58,890 --> 00:03:02,816
â™«  Without noticing, you broke into my heart  â™«

26
00:03:02,816 --> 00:03:06,656
â™«  Slowly immersing myself, I become undaunted by perils for love  â™«

27
00:03:06,656 --> 00:03:09,920
â™«  I charge into battle with unmatched resilience  â™«

28
00:03:09,920 --> 00:03:12,120
Shen Du, it's snowing.

29
00:03:13,953 --> 00:03:17,741
â™«  Deeply in love, you are the one I have chosen  â™«

30
00:03:17,741 --> 00:03:20,880
â™«  Autumn moon and spring breeze, I only want you for my whole life  â™«

31
00:03:20,880 --> 00:03:22,444
Come here.

32
00:03:23,487 --> 00:03:26,337
â€‹â™«  Your gaze  â™«

33
00:03:26,337 --> 00:03:29,540
â™«  Our love is heating up  â™«

34
00:03:29,540 --> 00:03:31,220
Look.

35
00:03:34,980 --> 00:03:38,840
It's finally snowing.

36
00:03:38,840 --> 00:03:41,557
â€‹â™«  Your gaze  â™«

37
00:03:41,557 --> 00:03:44,330
â™«  Our love is heating up  â™«

38
00:03:44,330 --> 00:03:48,872
â™«  You are the only one for me  â™«

39
00:03:52,080 --> 00:03:55,775
â™«  Deeply in love, you are the one I have chosen  â™«

40
00:03:55,775 --> 00:03:59,651
â™«  Autumn moon and spring breeze, I only want you for my whole life  â™«

41
00:03:59,651 --> 00:04:01,621
â™«  The trace of your palm  â™«

42
00:04:01,621 --> 00:04:04,471
â€‹â™«  Your gaze  â™«

43
00:04:04,471 --> 00:04:07,283
â™«  Our love is heating up  â™«

44
00:04:07,283 --> 00:04:10,983
â™«  Deeply in love, you are the one I have chosen  â™«

45
00:04:10,983 --> 00:04:14,936
â™«  Autumn moon and spring breeze, I only want you for my whole life  â™«

46
00:04:14,936 --> 00:04:16,840
â™«  The trace of your palm  â™«

47
00:04:16,840 --> 00:04:19,691
â€‹â™«  Your gaze  â™«

48
00:04:19,691 --> 00:04:22,464
â™«  Our love is heating up  â™«

49
00:04:22,464 --> 00:04:27,106
â™«  You are the only one for me  â™«

50
00:04:43,900 --> 00:04:48,800
Did I cross the line with Prime Minister Zhang today?

51
00:04:49,540 --> 00:04:52,940
You can't pretend to be a spy for Prime Minister Zhang forever.

52
00:04:52,940 --> 00:04:56,240
You have to end this one day.

53
00:04:56,240 --> 00:05:00,460
But you suddenly brought up my family's old case today.

54
00:05:00,460 --> 00:05:03,080
Was it due to some new conjectures?

55
00:05:03,900 --> 00:05:07,840
I kind of did it on purpose to see his reaction.

56
00:05:07,840 --> 00:05:11,840
It seems that Prime Minister Zhang definitely knows something.

57
00:05:14,040 --> 00:05:17,640
There are so many confusing leads these days.

58
00:05:17,640 --> 00:05:20,560
Nothing is certain.

59
00:05:20,560 --> 00:05:24,500
But I'm certain that long before my family was caught in trouble,

60
00:05:24,500 --> 00:05:28,280
multiple forces of power had been plotting things.

61
00:05:28,280 --> 00:05:29,960
I have a hunch.

62
00:05:29,960 --> 00:05:31,520
What is it?

63
00:05:31,520 --> 00:05:36,020
I think that the situation your father faced

64
00:05:36,020 --> 00:05:39,900
resembles what you're facing now.

65
00:05:39,900 --> 00:05:43,860
You're mediating among several powers.

66
00:05:43,860 --> 00:05:46,900
It's hard to remain neutral and maintain a dignified stance.

67
00:05:46,900 --> 00:05:49,260
A slight misstep couldâ€¦

68
00:05:49,260 --> 00:05:51,720
Lead to a disaster, and everyone will turn against you.

69
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:55,480
But sticking to your aspirations is not wrong.

70
00:05:55,480 --> 00:05:59,000
Nor is it wrong to not bend over to those in power.

71
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:00,980
Shen Du,

72
00:06:00,980 --> 00:06:05,880
please go on with what you should and want to do.

73
00:06:05,880 --> 00:06:12,140
I will do my best to help you find the truth and do your family justice.

74
00:06:23,520 --> 00:06:26,080
A white Winter Solstice.

75
00:06:26,080 --> 00:06:28,820
There will be a good harvest next year.

76
00:06:38,640 --> 00:06:43,760
Is this all you've got, Great Chief? Let's see if you can catch up with me.

77
00:06:58,890 --> 00:07:01,614
â™«  I want to be with you, shadows become a pair  â™«

78
00:07:01,614 --> 00:07:05,603
â™«  I want to hold you, staying by my side  â™«

79
00:07:05,603 --> 00:07:09,664
â™«  Passing through the obstruction of a storm  â™«

80
00:07:09,664 --> 00:07:12,374
â™«  I want to be your moonlight  â™«

81
00:07:12,374 --> 00:07:16,344
â™«  To accompany you to every dawn  â™«

82
00:07:16,344 --> 00:07:22,932
â™«  How I wish I could just forget the length of time  â™«

83
00:07:22,932 --> 00:07:25,702
â™«  I want to be with you, shadows become a pair  â™«

84
00:07:25,702 --> 00:07:29,681
â™«  I want to be with you, never forgetting each other  â™«

85
00:07:29,681 --> 00:07:33,624
â™«  There is always a place where the clouds and the sea meet  â™«

86
00:07:33,624 --> 00:07:36,340
â™«  I want to accompany you forever  â™«

87
00:07:36,340 --> 00:07:40,288
â™«  I will wait until my black hair turns grey  â™«

88
00:07:40,288 --> 00:07:48,776
â™«  In this life, I will only keep you in my heart  â™«

89
00:08:20,300 --> 00:08:23,920
Stickler Jiang! Stickler Jiang!

90
00:08:23,920 --> 00:08:25,500
- Hurry up! 
 - Chuichui!

91
00:08:25,500 --> 00:08:27,452
Hurry up!

92
00:08:28,900 --> 00:08:30,380
How are you? Are you cold?

93
00:08:30,380 --> 00:08:31,780
Of course, I am.

94
00:08:31,780 --> 00:08:33,684
Any better?

95
00:08:36,060 --> 00:08:38,340
Where did you go?

96
00:08:42,250 --> 00:08:44,520
I went to buy you snacks.

97
00:08:51,780 --> 00:08:53,552
Try it.

98
00:09:05,040 --> 00:09:08,060
- It's good. 
 - No rush.

99
00:09:08,060 --> 00:09:10,400
Look at those cheeks.

100
00:09:16,600 --> 00:09:18,288
It's good.

101
00:09:29,560 --> 00:09:32,000
Let's build a snowman.

102
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:48,200
Doesn't it look like you?

103
00:09:48,900 --> 00:09:51,020
Not at all. Mine looks like you.

104
00:09:51,020 --> 00:09:53,560
No, it doesn't. Not at all.

105
00:09:53,560 --> 00:09:56,280
- Mine looks like you. 
 - You made it so chubby.

106
00:09:57,320 --> 00:09:59,200
Be careful.

107
00:10:00,408 --> 00:10:01,940
- Chuichui. 
 - Come and get me.

108
00:10:01,940 --> 00:10:04,480
It's snowing. Take the umbrella.

109
00:10:45,760 --> 00:10:48,480
   

110
00:10:48,480 --> 00:10:53,980
Huan, you always liked the winter snow.

111
00:10:54,900 --> 00:11:00,180
You said that the snow was the purest...

112
00:11:01,020 --> 00:11:06,160
and could cover all the filth and ugliness in the world.

113
00:11:07,360 --> 00:11:09,600
Huan,

114
00:11:09,600 --> 00:11:15,620
how have I done over the years?

115
00:11:16,860 --> 00:11:19,380
Are you pleased?

116
00:11:20,460 --> 00:11:23,220
I really don't know

117
00:11:23,220 --> 00:11:26,800
if I have done anything wrong.

118
00:11:27,420 --> 00:11:29,660
Tell me.

119
00:11:29,660 --> 00:11:32,000
When the time comes

120
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:34,880
for us to meet in the underworld,

121
00:11:36,400 --> 00:11:38,960
will you blame me?

122
00:11:49,440 --> 00:11:51,340
Grand Empress Dowager.

123
00:11:57,740 --> 00:12:02,800
My eyes got smoked by the incense.

124
00:12:02,800 --> 00:12:04,800
Why did you come back?

125
00:12:04,800 --> 00:12:08,560
Didn't I tell you to take days off for the holiday?

126
00:12:08,560 --> 00:12:11,080
I'm used to dealing with state affairs.

127
00:12:11,080 --> 00:12:13,760
Now that I'm idle, I feel bored.

128
00:12:13,760 --> 00:12:17,980
Besides, I feel that the snowy night is most boring and lonely.

129
00:12:17,980 --> 00:12:20,800
That's why I begged Music Minister Jin to come along with me

130
00:12:20,800 --> 00:12:23,600
to have some fun with Your Majesty.

131
00:12:23,600 --> 00:12:24,920
Look at you.

132
00:12:24,920 --> 00:12:31,760
I know you think that I am all alone, feeling sad.

133
00:12:31,760 --> 00:12:35,160
So you made up something to keep me company.

134
00:12:35,160 --> 00:12:40,220
Grand Empress Dowager, I just composed a new song named "Sorrow and Joy."

135
00:12:40,220 --> 00:12:44,480
I wonder if Your Majesty would be interested in listening to it.

136
00:12:45,080 --> 00:12:47,320
Prepare some dishes.

137
00:12:47,320 --> 00:12:50,600
Let's have a nice time like the common folks,

138
00:12:50,600 --> 00:12:54,860
eating and drinking to celebrate the Winter Solstice.

139
00:12:54,860 --> 00:12:56,920
   

140
00:13:14,360 --> 00:13:17,650
Don't melt! Don't melt! Don't melt!

141
00:13:17,650 --> 00:13:19,620
Don't melt!

142
00:13:27,240 --> 00:13:30,680
No! No!

143
00:13:30,680 --> 00:13:32,920
You can only be mine.

144
00:13:34,560 --> 00:13:36,340
Mine.

145
00:13:49,960 --> 00:13:54,400
I will not allow anyone to take away anything I want.

146
00:13:54,400 --> 00:13:57,320
Never!

147
00:14:08,780 --> 00:14:10,750
Good!

148
00:14:11,760 --> 00:14:13,396
Here.

149
00:14:19,600 --> 00:14:22,840
Grand Empress Dowager, Vice Minister Lai has come to request an audience.

150
00:14:23,620 --> 00:14:25,320
Bring him in.

151
00:14:28,040 --> 00:14:32,200
Why did he come on such a snowy night?

152
00:14:41,040 --> 00:14:42,440
Minister Lai.

153
00:14:42,440 --> 00:14:44,800
Why did you come here in the snow

154
00:14:44,800 --> 00:14:47,440
instead of celebrating at home?

155
00:14:47,440 --> 00:14:49,560
Is there anything urgent?

156
00:14:49,560 --> 00:14:50,880
Grand Empress Dowager,

157
00:14:50,880 --> 00:14:53,920
I just received an anonymous tip that Yan Xing

158
00:14:53,920 --> 00:14:58,220
was sent to Great Chief Shen to win him over by Prime Minister Zhang.

159
00:14:58,220 --> 00:14:59,440
Earlier today,

160
00:14:59,440 --> 00:15:04,020
Prime Minister Zhang even threatened her with the safety of her family.

161
00:15:06,520 --> 00:15:10,700
Someone is trying to stir things up.

162
00:15:12,160 --> 00:15:16,280
Does Yan Xing truly work for Prince Xian?

163
00:15:16,280 --> 00:15:20,500
Grand Empress Dowager, I'm afraid that there are some misunderstandings.

164
00:15:20,500 --> 00:15:26,080
The informant also stated that you bestowed the marriage decree on Third Miss Yan.

165
00:15:26,080 --> 00:15:28,600
Yet the Yan family swapped her with Sixth Miss Yan on purpose.

166
00:15:28,600 --> 00:15:32,220
Sixth Miss Yan has been promoted to the Chief Director of the Ministry of Justice.

167
00:15:32,220 --> 00:15:35,600
The Yan family obviously had an ulterior motive.

168
00:15:35,600 --> 00:15:39,900
Does Sixth Miss Yan truly work for Prince Xian?

169
00:15:41,600 --> 00:15:42,940
Grand Empress Dowager,

170
00:15:42,940 --> 00:15:45,480
please allow me to say something.

171
00:15:45,480 --> 00:15:48,640
Sixth Miss Yan is my niece.

172
00:15:48,640 --> 00:15:51,680
I know that she has always wanted to become

173
00:15:51,680 --> 00:15:53,800
a female official who solves cases.

174
00:15:53,800 --> 00:15:56,040
She was married to Shen Du by mistake,

175
00:15:56,040 --> 00:15:58,880
but her heart remained sincere

176
00:15:58,880 --> 00:16:01,040
without a trace of malice.

177
00:16:01,040 --> 00:16:03,560
I beg for Your Majesty's discernment.

178
00:16:04,280 --> 00:16:05,440
Jinzang,

179
00:16:05,440 --> 00:16:07,340
this is the first time

180
00:16:07,340 --> 00:16:09,760
you have commented on court affairs

181
00:16:09,760 --> 00:16:13,440
ever since I allowed you to play music in my palace.

182
00:16:14,240 --> 00:16:15,920
I apologize!

183
00:16:15,920 --> 00:16:18,360
Minister Lai,

184
00:16:18,360 --> 00:16:24,200
did you come here in the middle of the night just to talk about Yan Xing?

185
00:16:24,200 --> 00:16:27,860
If there is anything else, tell me at once.

186
00:16:27,860 --> 00:16:29,880
I also learned that

187
00:16:29,880 --> 00:16:33,020
a nursery rhyme suddenly started spreading in Xiang'an,

188
00:16:33,020 --> 00:16:34,600
which sounded highly inappropriate.

189
00:16:34,600 --> 00:16:36,980
A nursery rhyme?

190
00:16:36,980 --> 00:16:38,640
"Red porridge with dates.

191
00:16:38,640 --> 00:16:40,600
Five feet from the sky.

192
00:16:40,600 --> 00:16:42,000
Citrus and persimmon cakes.

193
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:43,520
Difficult for a child to grasp.

194
00:16:43,520 --> 00:16:45,820
Do not speak carelessly. Who permitted this?

195
00:16:45,820 --> 00:16:48,340
The old lady frowns upon it. Salt shall rise."

196
00:16:48,340 --> 00:16:49,880
Madam Xu is clever.

197
00:16:49,880 --> 00:16:52,040
You must have figured out the problem.

198
00:16:52,040 --> 00:16:54,320
This nursery rhyme targets the Grand Empress Dowager.

199
00:16:54,320 --> 00:16:56,500
"Five feet from the sky. Difficult for a child to grasp."

200
00:16:56,500 --> 00:17:00,140
This is clearly disrespectful to Grand Empress Dowager and His Majesty.

201
00:17:00,140 --> 00:17:01,760
Outrageous!

202
00:17:01,760 --> 00:17:03,880
This nursery rhyme didn't just spring up.

203
00:17:03,880 --> 00:17:06,079
Someone must have plotted this.

204
00:17:06,079 --> 00:17:08,740
I humbly request the Grand Empress Dowager to make the decision.

205
00:17:14,640 --> 00:17:20,480
Can you find out who is spreading such rumors?

206
00:17:20,480 --> 00:17:23,560
The rumors circulated among the street kids.

207
00:17:23,560 --> 00:17:25,920
It's hard to find the source.

208
00:17:30,840 --> 00:17:33,080
All these yearsâ€¦

209
00:17:36,280 --> 00:17:38,920
All these years, I have...

210
00:17:39,720 --> 00:17:43,400
dedicated myself to the Xiao family's empire,

211
00:17:43,400 --> 00:17:46,320
yet there are always people who think

212
00:17:46,320 --> 00:17:49,240
that I did it for my selfish desires.

213
00:17:49,240 --> 00:17:53,560
They bewitch people with such a nursery rhyme.

214
00:17:53,560 --> 00:17:55,600
It's truly detestable.

215
00:17:55,600 --> 00:17:57,800
The Imperial Inspectorate will investigate it

216
00:17:57,800 --> 00:18:01,640
and help Your Majesty find this evil mastermind.

217
00:18:02,500 --> 00:18:03,880
Butâ€¦

218
00:18:03,880 --> 00:18:05,480
What's wrong?

219
00:18:05,480 --> 00:18:09,280
But this nursery rhyme adopts the tune of the song newly composed

220
00:18:09,280 --> 00:18:12,320
and performed by Music Minister Jin at the Winter Solstice feast

221
00:18:12,320 --> 00:18:14,520
at Prince Xian's mansion.

222
00:18:14,520 --> 00:18:16,712
"Sorrow and Joy."

223
00:18:21,820 --> 00:18:23,880
I humbly request the Grand Empress Dowager to discern.

224
00:18:23,880 --> 00:18:27,960
I composed this piece, inspired by the Winter Solstice.

225
00:18:27,960 --> 00:18:31,640
Indeed, it was first performed at the feast,

226
00:18:31,640 --> 00:18:33,860
but it did not have lyrics,

227
00:18:33,860 --> 00:18:36,900
let alone disloyal intentions.

228
00:18:36,900 --> 00:18:40,940
What if the listeners harbored ill will although the player didn't?

229
00:18:40,940 --> 00:18:42,720
The last line of that nursery rhyme says,

230
00:18:42,720 --> 00:18:45,080
"The old lady frowns upon it. Salt shall rise."

231
00:18:45,080 --> 00:18:46,760
"Salty" sounds just like "Xian".

232
00:18:46,760 --> 00:18:49,320
I'm afraid it refers to Prince Xian.

233
00:18:53,700 --> 00:18:56,100
Summon Prince Xian.

234
00:19:00,760 --> 00:19:04,300
Mother Empress, I am unaware of it. I am innocent.

235
00:19:04,300 --> 00:19:09,040
I first heard "Sorrow and Joy" on the feast and paid no further attention to it.

236
00:19:09,040 --> 00:19:13,760
I had no idea that someone would compose lyrics to insinuate Your Majesty!

237
00:19:13,760 --> 00:19:18,560
I don't believe it was done by Music Minister Jin or instigated by Prince Xian.

238
00:19:18,560 --> 00:19:22,120
But Music Minister Jin just performed the song at Prince Xian's mansion,

239
00:19:22,120 --> 00:19:25,280
and someone immediately spread it with disrespectful lyrics.

240
00:19:25,280 --> 00:19:28,620
What's more, the ending line implies

241
00:19:28,620 --> 00:19:32,560
that Prince Xian is seeking greater power.

242
00:19:35,340 --> 00:19:37,080
Please discern the truth, Mother Empress!

243
00:19:37,080 --> 00:19:41,020
Someone is using this nursery rhyme to sow discord between you and me

244
00:19:41,020 --> 00:19:44,080
and even to kill me, Mother Empress!

245
00:19:44,080 --> 00:19:46,880
Grand Empress Dowager, seditious words bewitch the people.

246
00:19:46,880 --> 00:19:49,280
If we allow this to carry on,

247
00:19:49,280 --> 00:19:51,800
at the very least, it would affect the reputation of Prince Xian and Music Minister Jin.

248
00:19:51,800 --> 00:19:53,320
At worst, people with evil intentions

249
00:19:53,320 --> 00:19:56,820
may accuse Prince Xian of plotting a usurpation.

250
00:20:01,760 --> 00:20:03,960
Grand Empress Dowager, please allow me

251
00:20:03,960 --> 00:20:06,940
to arrest all the guests at the feast in Prince Xian's mansion

252
00:20:06,940 --> 00:20:09,240
for a thorough investigation.

253
00:20:13,380 --> 00:20:16,160
This matter

254
00:20:16,160 --> 00:20:22,420
arose from the feast held by Prince Xian.

255
00:20:22,420 --> 00:20:24,140
From now on,

256
00:20:24,140 --> 00:20:29,520
Prince Xian, Xiao Zhong, will be placed under house arrest.

257
00:20:29,520 --> 00:20:31,680
Jinzang, who composed the song,

258
00:20:31,680 --> 00:20:35,900
shall await trial under the custody of the Imperial Inspectorate.

259
00:20:36,800 --> 00:20:40,440
The other musicians who attended the banquet...

260
00:20:41,080 --> 00:20:46,200
shall be investigated by the Imperial Inspectorate.

261
00:20:48,760 --> 00:20:50,612
I humbly obey Your Majesty's command!

262
00:20:57,170 --> 00:20:59,470
   

263
00:21:04,440 --> 00:21:06,000
Great Chief. Madam.

264
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:08,440
Madam Xu sent a confidential letter.

265
00:21:17,520 --> 00:21:19,520
What happened?

266
00:21:23,080 --> 00:21:25,400
 Things changed last night. Be very careful. 

267
00:21:25,400 --> 00:21:29,300
 Don't let the Shen and Yan families go through what had happened. 

268
00:21:29,920 --> 00:21:31,000
Help!

269
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:32,280
- Go! 
 - Help!

270
00:21:32,280 --> 00:21:33,560
Save me, Master!

271
00:21:33,560 --> 00:21:35,620
Master, save me!

272
00:21:35,620 --> 00:21:38,740
- Hurry up! 
 - Help me find my Sixth Daughter! Look for Great Chief!

273
00:21:38,740 --> 00:21:41,280
Help me find my sixth daughter and Great Chief!

274
00:21:41,280 --> 00:21:42,680
Hurry up!

275
00:21:44,880 --> 00:21:48,160
Find them to help me! 
    

276
00:21:48,160 --> 00:21:50,880
Quick! Go and inform Sixth Sister!

277
00:21:50,880 --> 00:21:53,340
Hurry, hurry, hurry! Close the door! Close the door!

278
00:21:53,340 --> 00:21:55,500
Quickly, close the door!

279
00:22:03,660 --> 00:22:05,452
Get in.

280
00:22:16,480 --> 00:22:18,188
A'Zang!

281
00:22:20,140 --> 00:22:21,380
What happened?

282
00:22:21,380 --> 00:22:23,360
My sister!

283
00:22:23,980 --> 00:22:25,684
A'Zang!

284
00:22:27,320 --> 00:22:29,520
What really happened?

285
00:22:29,520 --> 00:22:31,440
- Go! 
 - A'Zang!

286
00:22:31,440 --> 00:22:33,620
- Hurry up! Go! 
 - No!

287
00:22:33,620 --> 00:22:35,560
- Behave! Go! 
 - No!

288
00:22:35,560 --> 00:22:38,100
- A'Zang! 
 - Hurry up!

289
00:22:50,960 --> 00:22:54,140
Father, what happened? Why did they arrest my mother?

290
00:22:54,140 --> 00:22:57,220
Sixth Daughter, your mother was arrested by the Imperial Inspectorate.

291
00:22:57,220 --> 00:22:59,920
Your uncle Jinzang is accused of colluding with Prince Xian to rebel,

292
00:22:59,920 --> 00:23:01,900
and the whole clan will be implicated.

293
00:23:01,900 --> 00:23:03,520
My uncle is just a musician.

294
00:23:03,520 --> 00:23:04,840
How could he participate in a rebellion?

295
00:23:04,840 --> 00:23:06,800
No way! It's a setup!

296
00:23:06,800 --> 00:23:08,640
Sixth Miss, calm down.

297
00:23:08,640 --> 00:23:13,540
Your mother may have been arrested, but the Yan family hasn't been implicated.

298
00:23:13,540 --> 00:23:17,460
The Imperial Inspectorate wouldn't go after you just yet.

299
00:23:17,460 --> 00:23:20,000
The Yan family hasn't been implicated.

300
00:23:20,800 --> 00:23:21,920
That's right, Father.

301
00:23:21,920 --> 00:23:25,360
Mother is from the Jin family, but she has married into the Yan family. Sheâ€™s a married-out daughter.

302
00:23:25,360 --> 00:23:27,800
Logically speaking, it shouldn't have affected her.

303
00:23:27,800 --> 00:23:30,800
They have no reason to arrest her.

304
00:23:36,340 --> 00:23:39,760
Those people are like the soul reapers from the underworld.

305
00:23:39,760 --> 00:23:41,440
How can we reason with them?

306
00:23:41,440 --> 00:23:44,780
They just arrest whoever they want to arrest.

307
00:23:45,680 --> 00:23:47,920
No.

308
00:23:47,920 --> 00:23:50,000
It's not that they are unreasonable.

309
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:53,240
You didn't dare to reason with them, did you?

310
00:23:54,140 --> 00:23:55,380
Father. Mother.

311
00:23:55,380 --> 00:23:58,420
You let the Imperial Inspectorate arrest my mother for no reason,

312
00:23:58,420 --> 00:24:02,280
without stepping up to ask a question. Right?

313
00:24:09,180 --> 00:24:12,280
Fine. You all fear the Black Fiend.

314
00:24:12,280 --> 00:24:15,020
I don't. I'll save her if you don't.

315
00:24:15,020 --> 00:24:17,510
- Sixth Sister! 
 - Sixth Daughter!

316
00:24:18,120 --> 00:24:19,988
Sixth Daughter!

317
00:24:24,750 --> 00:24:27,690
   

318
00:24:30,616 --> 00:24:33,280
- Sixth Miss. 
 - Chuichui.

319
00:24:33,280 --> 00:24:35,080
There you are.

320
00:24:35,080 --> 00:24:38,120
Your Great Chief sent word from the palace through Jing Lin,

321
00:24:38,120 --> 00:24:41,960
saying he will meet the Grand Empress Dowager to plead on behalf of the Jin family.

322
00:24:42,460 --> 00:24:44,120
Stickler Jiang and I split up to look for you.

323
00:24:44,120 --> 00:24:46,880
I thought I could find you here.

324
00:24:46,880 --> 00:24:49,880
Chuichui, thank you!

325
00:24:49,880 --> 00:24:52,800
But Prince Xian is involved. The future is uncertain.

326
00:24:52,800 --> 00:24:54,660
It's not enough to have Shen Du's help.

327
00:24:54,660 --> 00:24:57,860
You go back first.  I'll go and find Prime Minister Zhang.

328
00:24:57,860 --> 00:25:00,680
All right, be careful!

329
00:25:24,020 --> 00:25:26,380
Stickler Jiang, is that you?

330
00:25:31,880 --> 00:25:33,744
Lai Luozhi.

331
00:25:41,360 --> 00:25:45,220
Are you disappointed that it's me?

332
00:25:45,780 --> 00:25:48,500
Iâ€¦ I have a date with Jiang Langxing.

333
00:25:48,500 --> 00:25:50,720
He will be coming soon.

334
00:25:50,720 --> 00:25:52,600
Jiang Langxing.

335
00:25:52,600 --> 00:25:55,160
Jiang Langxing.

336
00:25:55,160 --> 00:25:59,400
Is he the only one you care about now?

337
00:26:06,980 --> 00:26:09,000
So obedient.

338
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:11,136
How nice!

339
00:26:24,340 --> 00:26:26,280
The Chief Director of the Ministry of Justice

340
00:26:26,280 --> 00:26:28,960
is here to meet Prime Minister Zhang.

341
00:26:30,080 --> 00:26:32,840
Madam Shen, our lord is not home today.

342
00:26:32,840 --> 00:26:34,240
I have asked around.

343
00:26:34,240 --> 00:26:37,020
He's shut himself in ever since what happened to Prince Xian.

344
00:26:37,020 --> 00:26:39,680
He didn't even go to court today.

345
00:26:41,120 --> 00:26:42,800
The Chief Director of the Ministry of Justice,

346
00:26:42,800 --> 00:26:47,060
    
 wife of the Great Chief, the sixth daughter of Academician Yan,

347
00:26:47,060 --> 00:26:50,160
is here to request an audience with Prime Minister Zhang.

348
00:26:50,160 --> 00:26:52,660
Madam Shen, please don't make things hard for us.

349
00:26:52,660 --> 00:26:54,240
I won't.

350
00:26:54,240 --> 00:26:56,080
I will just wait here.

351
00:26:56,080 --> 00:26:59,620
In a day or two, he's bound to come out. Right?

352
00:26:59,620 --> 00:27:03,240
Surely, Prime Minister Zhang wouldn't take the back door

353
00:27:03,240 --> 00:27:07,780
or sneak through the dog hole just to avoid me. Right?

354
00:27:14,760 --> 00:27:18,640
I knew I couldn't easily get rid of you.

355
00:27:18,640 --> 00:27:24,800
If I do not come out, are you going to turn my mansion upside down?

356
00:27:26,820 --> 00:27:30,260
Prime Minister Zhang, please save the Jin family!

357
00:27:34,920 --> 00:27:36,960
Stop pushing me.

358
00:27:36,960 --> 00:27:40,440
I can't help you with what you're asking.

359
00:27:41,200 --> 00:27:45,040
Minister Zhang, you are the Prime Minister and the chief counselor.

360
00:27:45,040 --> 00:27:48,060
The Jin family suffers injustice. You can't ignore this.

361
00:27:48,060 --> 00:27:51,040
Since you have the Grand Empress Dowager's palace token,

362
00:27:51,040 --> 00:27:54,140
why do you seek my help but not hers?

363
00:27:54,140 --> 00:27:59,660
I'm just a low-ranking official who can only chatter in front of the Grand Empress Dowager.

364
00:27:59,660 --> 00:28:03,020
I would be overestimating myself to believe that

365
00:28:03,020 --> 00:28:05,460
I can interfere with court affairs.

366
00:28:06,240 --> 00:28:08,960
Since you understand that,

367
00:28:08,960 --> 00:28:12,630
then how come you don't get why Lai Luozhi

368
00:28:12,630 --> 00:28:15,360
is blaming this on Music Minister Jin?

369
00:28:17,640 --> 00:28:19,680
It's because of me?

370
00:28:19,680 --> 00:28:24,420
This is happening because you are both married to Shen Du and working as

371
00:28:24,420 --> 00:28:28,820
the Chief Director of the Ministry of Justice who keeps causing trouble.

372
00:28:28,820 --> 00:28:32,220
Of course. It's not just that.

373
00:28:32,220 --> 00:28:34,760
It is said that on the night of the Winter Solstice,

374
00:28:34,760 --> 00:28:37,680
Lai Luozhi reported to the Grand Empress Dowager

375
00:28:37,680 --> 00:28:42,580
that you were sent by me to win over Shen Du

376
00:28:42,580 --> 00:28:45,620
and serve Prince Xian in the power struggle.

377
00:28:45,620 --> 00:28:51,740
Music Minister Jin refuted him and defied the Grand Empress Dowager right on the spot.

378
00:28:54,880 --> 00:28:56,900
My younger uncle...

379
00:28:57,640 --> 00:29:00,120
defied the Grand Empress Dowager for me?

380
00:29:00,120 --> 00:29:03,940
Our laws forbid palace attendants and musicians

381
00:29:03,940 --> 00:29:06,100
from discussing court affairs.

382
00:29:06,100 --> 00:29:08,280
Violation is met with the death penalty.

383
00:29:08,280 --> 00:29:11,700
But Jinzang grew arrogant from favoritism.

384
00:29:11,700 --> 00:29:14,840
He overestimated himself.

385
00:29:14,840 --> 00:29:18,000
Uncle wasn't arrogant from favoritism.

386
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:20,460
Nor did he overestimate himself.

387
00:29:20,460 --> 00:29:22,600
He did that because he's my younger uncle.

388
00:29:22,600 --> 00:29:25,000
He sees me as his family.

389
00:29:25,000 --> 00:29:29,420
He'd rather risk his life than see me in trouble.

390
00:29:29,420 --> 00:29:30,940
Sixth Miss,

391
00:29:30,940 --> 00:29:36,380
all these years, I've been using you people instead of caring for you.

392
00:29:36,380 --> 00:29:41,000
But regarding this matter, I've said all that can be said.

393
00:29:41,000 --> 00:29:44,240
Between Prince Xian and the Jin family,

394
00:29:44,240 --> 00:29:48,380
I have no choice.

395
00:30:01,930 --> 00:30:04,770
   

396
00:30:08,820 --> 00:30:10,610
Back then,

397
00:30:10,610 --> 00:30:16,480
were you faced with the same choices regarding the Shen family's case?

398
00:30:27,280 --> 00:30:29,176
My Lord.

399
00:30:36,680 --> 00:30:41,320
Prince Xian is under house arrest, and yet I've remained silent.

400
00:30:41,320 --> 00:30:43,080
Do you know why?

401
00:30:43,080 --> 00:30:45,280
No, I don't.

402
00:30:46,440 --> 00:30:49,780
I've watched Prince Xian grow up.

403
00:30:49,780 --> 00:30:52,360
My feelings for Prince Xian

404
00:30:52,360 --> 00:30:55,500
are just like those of Jinzang for Yan Xing.

405
00:30:55,500 --> 00:31:01,260
Of course, I wish to risk myself to get Prince Xian out of this.

406
00:31:01,920 --> 00:31:03,840
The disaster of this nursery rhyme,

407
00:31:03,840 --> 00:31:09,240
I know very well that Prince Xian has no heart for usurpation.

408
00:31:09,240 --> 00:31:13,620
The Grand Empress Dowager knows that as well.

409
00:31:14,760 --> 00:31:19,220
But Her Majesty is not just a mother,

410
00:31:20,880 --> 00:31:24,720
she is also the Grand Empress Dowager of Great Cang.

411
00:31:24,720 --> 00:31:29,680
If I step forward, then my disciples will follow my footsteps

412
00:31:29,680 --> 00:31:35,840
and file petitions to the Grand Empress Dowager, urging her to release Prince Xian.

413
00:31:38,840 --> 00:31:41,920
The more pressure we apply,

414
00:31:41,920 --> 00:31:46,694
the more we push Prince Xian to a dead end.

415
00:31:46,694 --> 00:31:50,160
   

416
00:31:50,160 --> 00:31:53,308
Chuichui! Chuichui!

417
00:31:53,308 --> 00:31:55,680
- What's wrong? What's the rush? 
 - Has Chuichui come back?

418
00:31:55,680 --> 00:31:58,020
Didn't she go out with you earlier?

419
00:31:58,020 --> 00:31:59,600
We split up to look for Yan Xing.

420
00:31:59,600 --> 00:32:01,590
Hasn't she returned yet?

421
00:32:02,200 --> 00:32:06,680
Then maybe she found Director Yan and went off for fun somewhere.

422
00:32:06,680 --> 00:32:09,080
Why don't you just ask Director Yan?

423
00:32:09,080 --> 00:32:10,320
- All right. 
 -  Go askâ€”

424
00:32:10,320 --> 00:32:13,180
Why would he bother Director Yan?

425
00:32:13,180 --> 00:32:14,600
What's wrong, My Lord?

426
00:32:14,600 --> 00:32:19,460
Director Yan, don't you know her maiden family is in deep trouble?

427
00:32:20,880 --> 00:32:24,140
The Jin family is suspected of inciting Prince Xian to plot a rebellion

428
00:32:24,140 --> 00:32:26,860
and was arrested by the Imperial Inspectorate.

429
00:32:26,860 --> 00:32:28,240
Right.

430
00:32:28,240 --> 00:32:31,040
Do not bother Director Yan no matter what.

431
00:32:31,040 --> 00:32:33,400
Director Wu, you're right. I'll look for her by myself.

432
00:32:33,400 --> 00:32:35,020
I'll take my leave.

433
00:32:35,020 --> 00:32:37,000
Be careful.

434
00:33:16,380 --> 00:33:18,600
Where am I?

435
00:33:21,520 --> 00:33:24,380
People call me the Black Fiend.

436
00:33:25,340 --> 00:33:30,040
So perhaps, this is the Underworld.

437
00:33:30,040 --> 00:33:34,420
What do you want? Are you going to kill me?

438
00:33:41,480 --> 00:33:46,680
The eighteen levels of inferno are meant for others.

439
00:33:47,500 --> 00:33:51,180
Even if you truly arrive at the Underworld one day,

440
00:33:51,180 --> 00:33:54,200
I will light up the bones as lamps and burn the evil spirits

441
00:33:54,200 --> 00:33:57,060
to illuminate this Palace of Death

442
00:33:57,060 --> 00:34:01,520
and make it as cozy as home for you.

443
00:34:03,560 --> 00:34:06,220
You can't escape.

444
00:34:22,940 --> 00:34:25,700
Why are you scared?

445
00:34:35,430 --> 00:34:39,959
I will not hurt you.

446
00:34:45,880 --> 00:34:47,696
Chuichui,

447
00:34:49,860 --> 00:34:52,259
lift your head up.

448
00:34:53,390 --> 00:34:57,660
Look. What do you think? Do you like it?

449
00:35:07,940 --> 00:35:10,920
This isâ€¦

450
00:35:15,000 --> 00:35:19,560
I heard you liked the betrothal gifts Jiang Langxing sent to you.

451
00:35:22,880 --> 00:35:26,220
So you like these things.

452
00:35:26,220 --> 00:35:30,740
So I bought everything that the girls in Xiang'an Street like,

453
00:35:30,740 --> 00:35:36,220
as well as all the betrothal gifts that wealthy families use when proposing.

454
00:35:36,220 --> 00:35:38,240
What do you think?

455
00:35:39,300 --> 00:35:41,440
What do you want?

456
00:35:41,440 --> 00:35:42,960
Propose to you, of course.

457
00:35:42,960 --> 00:35:44,320
Propose to me?

458
00:35:44,320 --> 00:35:47,940
I'll ask your parents to marry you off to me.

459
00:35:47,940 --> 00:35:49,840
What are you talking about?

460
00:35:49,840 --> 00:35:54,260
I am engaged to Jiang Langxing. I am going to marry him.

461
00:35:55,160 --> 00:35:59,040
What's so good about that stickler inspector?

462
00:35:59,040 --> 00:36:01,700
Whatever he offers, I can give you ten times of it.

463
00:36:01,700 --> 00:36:06,560
It's not about that. I have agreed to marry him.

464
00:36:12,680 --> 00:36:15,030
So what?

465
00:36:15,030 --> 00:36:18,180
You can get a divorce even if you're married.

466
00:36:25,420 --> 00:36:30,540
If you feel sorry for him, I can compensate him on your behalf.

467
00:36:30,540 --> 00:36:32,760
I can kill Xu Xiangren

468
00:36:32,760 --> 00:36:37,020
and make him the Marshal of Inspectors as long as he wants me to.

469
00:36:37,020 --> 00:36:39,040
Don't be ridiculous!

470
00:36:42,200 --> 00:36:46,900
Fine. I'll do as you say.

471
00:36:46,900 --> 00:36:49,560
How come you just don't get it?

472
00:36:50,700 --> 00:36:53,640
Jiang Langxing and I like each other.

473
00:36:53,640 --> 00:36:56,900
We like each other, too. I like you so dearly.

474
00:36:56,900 --> 00:36:59,360
I've never cared for a woman so much before.

475
00:36:59,360 --> 00:37:00,680
But I don't like you.

476
00:37:00,680 --> 00:37:03,960
You're lying! You obviously like me, too.

477
00:37:05,100 --> 00:37:08,560
Didn't you call me Masked Man and consider me a good friend?

478
00:37:08,560 --> 00:37:11,660
Besidesâ€¦ Besides, our mothers are buried in the same place.

479
00:37:11,660 --> 00:37:13,440
This is fate.

480
00:37:13,440 --> 00:37:17,520
The affection between friends is different from that between a couple.

481
00:37:17,520 --> 00:37:19,860
I have no feelings for you.

482
00:37:19,860 --> 00:37:24,340
Impossible! You will find out that I'm right very soon.

483
00:37:40,600 --> 00:37:42,340
Let go of me!

484
00:38:57,140 --> 00:38:58,990
It's all right.

485
00:38:59,740 --> 00:39:02,490
I can wait.

486
00:39:02,490 --> 00:39:06,940
One day, you will fall in love with me.

487
00:39:27,830 --> 00:39:30,240
   

488
00:39:30,240 --> 00:39:33,920
Stop right there. The Jin case is assigned to the Imperial Inspectorate.

489
00:39:33,920 --> 00:39:35,820
The Ministry of Justice has no right to intervene.

490
00:39:35,820 --> 00:39:38,360
Director Yan, please go back.

491
00:39:39,100 --> 00:39:40,884
Hold on.

492
00:39:42,560 --> 00:39:43,760
Vice Minister Lai.

493
00:39:43,760 --> 00:39:47,720
Madam Shen, there is an easy way to save your family.

494
00:39:47,720 --> 00:39:53,060
File a lawsuit against Shen Du for framing the Jin family.

495
00:39:53,060 --> 00:39:57,560
Then I will clear your name and save your family.

496
00:39:58,880 --> 00:40:03,020
Please stop teasing me for fun.

497
00:40:03,020 --> 00:40:07,380
You want me to frame my husband? Absolutely impossible!

498
00:40:07,380 --> 00:40:12,940
I didn't know that the woman who married into the Shen family as a spy

499
00:40:12,940 --> 00:40:17,120
ended up deeply in love with Shen Du.

500
00:40:17,120 --> 00:40:21,740
Vice Minister Lai, you can stop using that as leverage.

501
00:40:21,740 --> 00:40:25,440
I've clarified it with my husband and Prime Minister Zhang.

502
00:40:25,440 --> 00:40:29,960
I have a clear conscience. I haven't done anything wrong.

503
00:40:29,960 --> 00:40:32,880
I've worked hard in the Ministry of Justice,

504
00:40:32,880 --> 00:40:36,980
striving to look for the truth and do people justice.

505
00:40:36,980 --> 00:40:39,160
We're talking about Shen Du, my husband.

506
00:40:39,160 --> 00:40:42,060
But even if we're talking about a stranger, I, Sixth Miss Yan,

507
00:40:42,060 --> 00:40:46,980
would never do anything to disgrace the title I uphold.

508
00:40:46,980 --> 00:40:49,440
Madam Shen, you don't have to talk tough.

509
00:40:49,440 --> 00:40:53,360
One day, you will comply.

510
00:40:55,200 --> 00:40:58,220
Director Yan, please go back.

511
00:41:02,560 --> 00:41:04,180
Please.

512
00:41:36,700 --> 00:41:38,344
Sixth Miss.

513
00:41:44,780 --> 00:41:46,890
You're back.

514
00:41:46,890 --> 00:41:48,616
Sixth Miss,

515
00:41:50,720 --> 00:41:53,120
Grand Empress Dowager didn't change her mind.

516
00:41:53,660 --> 00:41:55,920
I will think of something else.

517
00:41:56,820 --> 00:41:58,480
I've guessed as much.

518
00:41:58,480 --> 00:42:00,560
I went to see Prime Minister Zhang today

519
00:42:00,560 --> 00:42:04,320
and came to understand Her Majesty's difficult situation.

520
00:42:05,480 --> 00:42:09,620
I wasn't there in person but I could imagine how it happened.

521
00:42:09,620 --> 00:42:15,380
If Lai Luozhi managed to pin those charges on Prince Xian,

522
00:42:15,400 --> 00:42:18,120
then it wouldn't just be a catastrophe for the Jin family.

523
00:42:18,120 --> 00:42:22,140
The court will see turbulences and a power struggle.

524
00:42:26,980 --> 00:42:30,320
Who knows how many families will be annihilated?

525
00:42:30,320 --> 00:42:32,440
I will figure something out.

526
00:42:35,220 --> 00:42:37,020
Tomorrow,

527
00:42:37,780 --> 00:42:41,360
the Imperial Inspectorate will parade the Jins through the streets.

528
00:42:43,400 --> 00:42:45,920
We may have a chance afterward.

529
