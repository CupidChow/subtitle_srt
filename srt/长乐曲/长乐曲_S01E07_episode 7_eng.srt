 "Go Ahead Fearlessly" - Liu Yuning 

3
00:00:32,050 --> 00:00:34,993
♫  Grudges and karma, right and wrong  ♫

4
00:00:34,993 --> 00:00:38,191
♫  The past hides blood and tears  ♫

5
00:00:38,191 --> 00:00:40,660
♫  It is hard to catch up after years of separation  ♫

6
00:00:40,660 --> 00:00:44,535
♫  The truth cannot be fully revealed  ♫

7
00:00:44,535 --> 00:00:47,670
♫  Fate is full of twists and turns  ♫

8
00:00:47,670 --> 00:00:50,835
♫  Life and death, fortune and misfortune go hand in hand  ♫

9
00:00:50,835 --> 00:00:55,871
♫  Obsession is hard to get rid of, keeping the truth 
 and getting rid of the lies, let the wind blow  ♫

10
00:00:55,871 --> 00:01:02,143
♫  Tossed about by the wind and rain, I will never regret it, 
 I will accompany you for my whole life  ♫

11
00:01:02,143 --> 00:01:08,351
♫  At least you share my joy and sorrow  ♫

12
00:01:08,351 --> 00:01:14,730
♫  Unravelling fate, fearlessly, a dream returns  ♫

13
00:01:14,730 --> 00:01:21,043
♫  The mountains and rivers are bright and beautiful, 
 holding hands, together we return  ♫

14
00:01:21,043 --> 00:01:29,087
♫  In this life, my heart returns untainted of dust and ash  ♫

15
00:01:29,087 --> 00:01:37,221
   

16
00:01:37,221 --> 00:01:40,156
   

17
00:02:42,240 --> 00:02:44,520
I've practiced the pipa for two hours.

18
00:02:44,520 --> 00:02:47,160
It's more exhausting than having a day of autopsy.

19
00:02:47,780 --> 00:02:50,000
Qin, get me some preserved fruits.

20
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:51,672
Yes.

21
00:02:55,440 --> 00:02:57,316
Great Chief.

22
00:03:02,040 --> 00:03:03,320
What are you doing here?

23
00:03:03,320 --> 00:03:07,160
This is the Shen Mansion. I can do whatever I want.

24
00:03:07,160 --> 00:03:08,720
But you…

25
00:03:08,720 --> 00:03:10,840
Do you really consider yourself the hostess here?

26
00:03:10,840 --> 00:03:13,820
How dare you ask my servant late at night to get the preserved fruits from the kitchen,

27
00:03:13,820 --> 00:03:16,660
and play noisy sounds on the pipa.

28
00:03:18,080 --> 00:03:19,260
I'm sorry.

29
00:03:19,260 --> 00:03:22,200
I bought these preserved fruits from west street.

30
00:03:22,200 --> 00:03:26,300
Next time, I will get them myself and not trouble your servants.

31
00:03:26,300 --> 00:03:28,200
As for the noisy sounds,

32
00:03:28,200 --> 00:03:30,200
in order to make them pleasant as soon as possible,

33
00:03:30,200 --> 00:03:32,900
I can only practice all night to make it sound good.

34
00:03:32,900 --> 00:03:35,040
Please forgive me.

35
00:03:35,040 --> 00:03:37,160
Singing and dancing require talent.

36
00:03:37,160 --> 00:03:40,300
Cramming at the last minute will only invite ridicule.

37
00:03:40,300 --> 00:03:43,280
I advise you to give it up to pretend to be a courtesan.

38
00:03:43,280 --> 00:03:44,720
- What if I succeed? 
 - Even if you succeed, you won't solve the case anyway.

39
00:03:44,720 --> 00:03:46,500
- What if I succeed? 
 - Even if you succeed, you won't solve the case anyway.

40
00:03:46,500 --> 00:03:49,420
Don't forget the murderer targets one man and one woman.

41
00:03:49,420 --> 00:03:52,440
Just you alone is not enough.

42
00:03:52,440 --> 00:03:56,800
There must also be a man constantly entangled with the courtesan.

43
00:03:57,960 --> 00:04:02,660
Well, I do have a candidate in mind.

44
00:04:02,660 --> 00:04:06,320
Great Chief, please invite him over.

45
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:16,360
Well, I…

46
00:04:16,360 --> 00:04:18,680
Director Wu.

47
00:04:18,680 --> 00:04:23,520
Today, please accompany Madam Shen to the Mizar Festival together.

48
00:04:23,520 --> 00:04:27,660
She insisted you take this role.

49
00:04:30,880 --> 00:04:34,120
Great Chief, you have misunderstood me.

50
00:04:34,120 --> 00:04:36,000
I am wronged.

51
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:39,380
If you don't believe me, inquire at the Ministry of Justice.

52
00:04:39,380 --> 00:04:42,160
Madam Shen and I are by no means close.

53
00:04:42,160 --> 00:04:46,360
We can't get along well and are at loggerheads with each other.

54
00:04:46,360 --> 00:04:48,640
You don't have to be that anxious.

55
00:04:48,640 --> 00:04:54,000
Today, Madam Shen is only disguising herself as your pretty mistress.

56
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:57,120
Great Chief, well…

57
00:04:58,600 --> 00:05:01,260
Why me?

58
00:05:02,920 --> 00:05:05,080
Great Chief. Don't drag me.

59
00:05:05,080 --> 00:05:08,360
Great Chief! Great Chief!

60
00:05:25,400 --> 00:05:27,160
Why me?

61
00:05:27,160 --> 00:05:32,260
Because your mistress is so beautiful and famous in the Imperial City.

62
00:05:32,260 --> 00:05:34,060
You!

63
00:05:34,060 --> 00:05:35,300
Let me go.

64
00:05:35,300 --> 00:05:39,180
Great Chief. Madam Shen rarely dresses up like this, she looks quite charming indeed.

65
00:05:39,180 --> 00:05:43,020
If you have time to flatter me here, you'd better do something practical.

66
00:05:43,020 --> 00:05:44,420
Yes.

67
00:05:44,420 --> 00:05:46,080
Follow me.

68
00:05:55,320 --> 00:05:58,800
 Good! Good! 

69
00:05:59,720 --> 00:06:04,240
 Good! Good! 

70
00:06:05,920 --> 00:06:10,440
 During the Mizar Festival, the Grand Empress Dowager will make a street parade, requiring my escort. 

71
00:06:10,440 --> 00:06:12,600
 You must keep a close watch on Madam Shen. 

72
00:06:12,600 --> 00:06:15,800
 If there's any weird movement, capture him immediately. 

73
00:06:15,800 --> 00:06:19,880
 If something happens to her, you will be held accountable. 

74
00:06:24,200 --> 00:06:28,880
 Long live Your Majesty! 

75
00:06:28,880 --> 00:06:34,940
 Grand Empress Dowager, may you live long! 

76
00:06:37,780 --> 00:06:40,420
 Good! 

77
00:06:41,520 --> 00:06:43,140
Splendid!

78
00:06:43,140 --> 00:06:49,380
I wonder if there are any talented men or ladies who would like to perform on stage.

79
00:06:57,460 --> 00:06:58,440
Everyone!

80
00:06:58,440 --> 00:07:03,680
My beloved concubine wishes to present to you a piece of pipa music.

81
00:07:04,680 --> 00:07:07,280
 Good! 

82
00:07:07,280 --> 00:07:11,620
How dare this Wu Taiming bring his mistress here openly!

83
00:07:11,620 --> 00:07:15,260
How can he call the courtesan who has not been married in his family his concubine?

84
00:07:15,260 --> 00:07:19,400
He's embarrassing Madam Wu.

85
00:07:21,160 --> 00:07:25,840
 Long live Your Majesty! 

86
00:07:25,840 --> 00:07:32,160
 Grand Empress Dowager, may you live long! 

87
00:07:34,760 --> 00:07:36,320
Greetings, Your Majesty!

88
00:07:36,320 --> 00:07:39,000
Greetings, Grand Empress Dowager!

89
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:43,640
Your Majesties are coming to west street to parade for blessing.

90
00:07:43,640 --> 00:07:48,660
May Heaven bring good luck and great prosperity to Great Cang.

91
00:07:48,660 --> 00:07:50,360
May wind and rain come on time.

92
00:07:50,360 --> 00:07:52,940
May the country be prosperous and the people at peace.

93
00:08:13,400 --> 00:08:16,420
 Good! Good! 

94
00:08:38,540 --> 00:08:40,660
Really good!

95
00:09:21,200 --> 00:09:22,780
 Look! It's a phoenix! 

96
00:09:22,780 --> 00:09:24,340
 It is a phoenix! 

97
00:09:24,340 --> 00:09:28,140
 It is really beautiful! It's a divine bird! 

98
00:09:31,450 --> 00:09:34,230
   

99
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:57,160
 Good! Good! 

100
00:10:07,380 --> 00:10:10,000
It's Heaven's will.

101
00:10:13,240 --> 00:10:18,860
 May Heaven bring good luck and bless our Great Cang. 

102
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:30,560
 What is this fragrance? It's so strange. 

103
00:11:06,520 --> 00:11:09,360
 Thousands of butterflies and spring stars dance as the sleeves flutter. 

104
00:11:09,360 --> 00:11:11,780
 Nine-branched bells arise as melodies fill the night pavilion. 

105
00:11:11,780 --> 00:11:14,960
 Well matched! Good! 

106
00:11:49,840 --> 00:11:51,560
Madam!

107
00:11:51,560 --> 00:11:53,460
- Madam! 
 - Jing Lin.

108
00:11:53,460 --> 00:11:55,280
Great Chief, Wu Taiming and Madam are missing.

109
00:11:55,280 --> 00:11:57,016
Get on!

110
00:12:08,720 --> 00:12:10,060
Say it.

111
00:12:10,060 --> 00:12:11,800
Who is the mastermind behind the murder case?

112
00:12:11,800 --> 00:12:15,200
Murder case? What murder case?

113
00:12:15,200 --> 00:12:17,480
Where is Madam Shen?

114
00:12:17,480 --> 00:12:19,480
Spare my life.

115
00:12:19,480 --> 00:12:21,880
Great Chief, spare him!

116
00:12:23,800 --> 00:12:26,000
This is a scandal in my family.

117
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:27,300
My brother-in-law had an affair.

118
00:12:27,300 --> 00:12:29,880
I wanted to teach him a lesson. Is this a crime?

119
00:12:29,880 --> 00:12:33,040
 Most of these paired corpses knew each other well in life. 

120
00:12:33,040 --> 00:12:34,440
 They were often seen together. 

121
00:12:34,440 --> 00:12:38,640
 However, there are two pairs, for whom no entanglements have been found prior to their deaths. 

122
00:12:38,640 --> 00:12:40,368
Oh no!

123
00:12:45,120 --> 00:12:47,280
 I am Shen Du. Are you all right? 

124
00:12:47,280 --> 00:12:49,360
 Brother Shen Du. 

125
00:12:49,360 --> 00:12:51,560
 Brother Shen Du, do you still recognize me? 

126
00:12:51,560 --> 00:12:53,200
 Of course, I recognize you. 

127
00:12:53,200 --> 00:12:54,640
 Yan Xing. 

128
00:12:54,640 --> 00:12:56,920
 I would never forget you. 

129
00:12:57,600 --> 00:12:59,000
None of this is real.

130
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:01,140
 Should I recognize you? 

131
00:13:02,480 --> 00:13:05,580
 Don't try to be the real Madam Shen. 

132
00:13:06,380 --> 00:13:09,900
 You are not the wife I want to marry. 

133
00:13:10,760 --> 00:13:14,100
 Don’t even think about surviving in the Shen Mansion. 

134
00:13:30,520 --> 00:13:33,760
- Where is this? 
 - You don't need to know.

135
00:13:35,520 --> 00:13:37,000
Why have you killed so many people?

136
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:39,080
You don't need to know.

137
00:13:42,440 --> 00:13:45,680
Why do you talk so much nonsense?

138
00:13:45,680 --> 00:13:49,080
It seems today, I can't escape from you.

139
00:13:49,080 --> 00:13:53,280
Why don't you take off the mask and show me your face?

140
00:13:56,240 --> 00:13:59,240
Everyone knows you are smart, Sixth Miss Yan.

141
00:13:59,240 --> 00:14:03,260
If I show you my face, after you die,

142
00:14:10,080 --> 00:14:11,860
you will be a ghost

143
00:14:11,860 --> 00:14:13,680
and tell your husband in a dream.

144
00:14:13,680 --> 00:14:15,680
What would I do then?

145
00:14:17,040 --> 00:14:19,280
You have killed so many people.

146
00:14:19,280 --> 00:14:22,440
Their resentment has long turned into fierce ghosts surrounding you.

147
00:14:22,440 --> 00:14:24,840
And accompanying you day and night.

148
00:14:24,840 --> 00:14:26,360
Can't you see them?

149
00:14:26,360 --> 00:14:28,920
They are nothing,

150
00:14:31,200 --> 00:14:33,520
but people who deserved to die.

151
00:14:33,520 --> 00:14:37,540
Even if they turned into ghosts, they would still not dare to appear before me.

152
00:14:37,540 --> 00:14:39,620
Or I'd kill them again.

153
00:14:39,620 --> 00:14:42,000
Am I also someone who deserves to die?

154
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:44,520
The people you mentioned all share common traits,

155
00:14:44,520 --> 00:14:46,920
and you think they deserve to die.

156
00:14:46,920 --> 00:14:50,520
In your eyes, do I also deserve to die?

157
00:15:08,680 --> 00:15:12,760
Even if you ask so many questions, you have to die anyway.

158
00:15:13,720 --> 00:15:15,700
But…

159
00:15:18,240 --> 00:15:22,660
I still need to wait a little longer before taking action.

160
00:15:23,280 --> 00:15:24,540
What are you waiting for?

161
00:15:24,540 --> 00:15:27,920
I'm waiting for your blood to coagulate.

162
00:15:27,920 --> 00:15:31,920
Then when I take your heart out, you won't even bleed.

163
00:15:34,800 --> 00:15:37,400
But I'm the Great Chief's wife.

164
00:15:37,400 --> 00:15:39,440
If you dare to kill me,

165
00:15:39,440 --> 00:15:43,960
when they find you, they will certainly skin you alive and tear out your tendons.

166
00:15:45,680 --> 00:15:50,000
Even if I don't kill you, Shen Du won't let me go if he catches me.

167
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:52,460
I have to die anyway.

168
00:15:58,280 --> 00:16:02,340
I might as well drag Madam Shen down with me and use her as a scapegoat.

169
00:16:02,340 --> 00:16:04,440
I can plead for you.

170
00:16:04,440 --> 00:16:06,720
He might leave you an intact body.

171
00:16:06,720 --> 00:16:09,540
We have a very good relationship.

172
00:16:09,540 --> 00:16:11,320
The whole Xiang'an City knows it well.

173
00:16:11,320 --> 00:16:13,480
He will listen to me.

174
00:16:16,200 --> 00:16:18,200
 He will listen to me. 

175
00:16:18,200 --> 00:16:19,800
 He will listen to me. 

176
00:16:19,800 --> 00:16:21,800
 He will listen to me. 

177
00:16:21,800 --> 00:16:24,000
Shut up!

178
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:25,560
You shut up!

179
00:16:25,560 --> 00:16:27,160
You shameless hussy!

180
00:16:27,160 --> 00:16:28,440
He won't listen to you.

181
00:16:28,440 --> 00:16:31,980
He is mine, mine, mine!

182
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:38,796
Stop.

183
00:16:40,600 --> 00:16:42,316
Let me go!

184
00:16:43,960 --> 00:16:46,008
Sixth Miss.

185
00:16:48,240 --> 00:16:50,200
Are you all right?

186
00:16:51,300 --> 00:16:53,000
Sixth Miss.

187
00:17:07,480 --> 00:17:09,980
Thank you for arriving in time.

188
00:17:17,680 --> 00:17:20,440
Fortunately, you'd sprinkled flour on your clothes.

189
00:17:20,440 --> 00:17:22,979
The dog could follow your scent over here.

190
00:17:32,480 --> 00:17:34,268
How do you feel?

191
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:38,400
I-I'm fine.

192
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:40,920
But…

193
00:17:40,920 --> 00:17:43,040
Have you caught the murderer?

194
00:18:00,200 --> 00:18:05,020
 But I had a dream. 

195
00:18:05,840 --> 00:18:07,584
Jing Lin.

196
00:18:09,960 --> 00:18:12,540
Take off her mask.

197
00:18:22,240 --> 00:18:24,012
It's you.

198
00:18:32,200 --> 00:18:33,988
Sixth Miss.

199
00:18:37,200 --> 00:18:39,440
Take her to the Imperial Guards.

200
00:18:39,440 --> 00:18:40,580
Yes.

201
00:18:40,580 --> 00:18:43,360
- Take her away. 
 - Yes.

202
00:19:05,400 --> 00:19:08,720
Sixth Miss, you're awake.

203
00:19:08,720 --> 00:19:13,480
Chuichui, how long have I slept?

204
00:19:14,720 --> 00:19:17,440
Where is Madam Tang? Has she been interrogated?

205
00:19:17,440 --> 00:19:19,520
You've only slept for two hours.

206
00:19:19,520 --> 00:19:22,640
Why are you asking these questions right after waking up?

207
00:19:23,800 --> 00:19:27,120
No wonder Shen Du asked me to keep a good eye on you.

208
00:19:27,120 --> 00:19:29,100
What's the outcome?

209
00:19:29,960 --> 00:19:32,880
Of course, she won't admit it.

210
00:19:32,880 --> 00:19:36,420
But the Empress Dowager visits the Imperial Guards

211
00:19:36,420 --> 00:19:39,120
to interrogate her personally.

212
00:19:39,120 --> 00:19:41,600
Let's see if she will admit it this time.

213
00:19:41,600 --> 00:19:43,480
I'll go.

214
00:19:43,480 --> 00:19:45,640
You stay.

215
00:19:47,360 --> 00:19:50,160
You're not even off your medicine yet.

216
00:19:50,160 --> 00:19:52,080
I've been investigating this murderer for a long time.

217
00:19:52,080 --> 00:19:54,040
I know how to make her talk.

218
00:19:54,040 --> 00:19:55,720
No way.

219
00:19:55,720 --> 00:19:58,540
You'd almost lost your life today.

220
00:20:00,280 --> 00:20:02,680
The sky won't fall without you.

221
00:20:02,680 --> 00:20:04,860
Besides, Shen Du told me to keep an eye on you.

222
00:20:04,860 --> 00:20:08,240
Are you my friend or his friend?

223
00:20:08,240 --> 00:20:10,560
Chuichui, you know me.

224
00:20:10,560 --> 00:20:13,720
No one can stop me from doing anything I want.

225
00:20:16,160 --> 00:20:20,220
There is one thing I need your help with.

226
00:20:24,120 --> 00:20:29,680
I truly never expected that the one who committed this heinous crime

227
00:20:29,680 --> 00:20:35,000
would be the widow of Tang Chengyi, a loyal official.

228
00:20:35,560 --> 00:20:38,620
Why would you do such a thing?

229
00:20:48,680 --> 00:20:55,080
I remember you and Madam Tang were very close.

230
00:20:55,080 --> 00:21:00,360
Now, she is the suspect in the murder case.

231
00:21:00,360 --> 00:21:01,840
Princess of Valor,

232
00:21:01,840 --> 00:21:05,000
do you have an inside story?

233
00:21:05,800 --> 00:21:09,440
Mother Empress, although I had some interactions with Madam Tang,

234
00:21:09,440 --> 00:21:12,640
I really didn't know anything about her committing murder.

235
00:21:12,640 --> 00:21:14,760
If I had known she was the murderer,

236
00:21:14,760 --> 00:21:16,960
I would never have gotten close to her.

237
00:21:29,480 --> 00:21:31,640
Let me ask you.

238
00:21:31,640 --> 00:21:35,300
Why would you kill so many innocent people?

239
00:21:35,300 --> 00:21:36,880
They are not innocent.

240
00:21:36,880 --> 00:21:38,680
Great Cang has its own laws.

241
00:21:38,680 --> 00:21:42,280
If they are innocent or not, it's not for you to decide.

242
00:21:50,400 --> 00:21:52,400
I am Yan Xing, a clerk from the Ministry of Justice.

243
00:21:52,400 --> 00:21:54,320
Sorry for the abruptness in this urgent situation.

244
00:21:54,320 --> 00:21:56,980
Grand Empress Dowager, please forgive me.

245
00:22:01,960 --> 00:22:04,660
I have been lax in managing my household and have disturbed Your Majesty.

246
00:22:04,660 --> 00:22:06,520
I humbly request your punishment, Your Majesty.

247
00:22:06,520 --> 00:22:08,460
It's all right.

248
00:22:09,160 --> 00:22:13,920
I've heard that Madam Shen is quite skilled at solving cases through deduction.

249
00:22:13,920 --> 00:22:18,220
This Meng Ceran refuses to confess.

250
00:22:18,220 --> 00:22:20,660
What do you think?

251
00:22:25,840 --> 00:22:28,040
In response to Grand Empress Dowager.

252
00:22:28,040 --> 00:22:31,880
Those men Madam Tang killed all had matrimonial engagements.

253
00:22:31,880 --> 00:22:35,320
Yet they loved to have fun with courtesans.

254
00:22:35,320 --> 00:22:39,760
And those women all had a similar appearance, with a flying fairy hairstyle,

255
00:22:39,760 --> 00:22:42,000
and were courtesans skilled in playing the pipa.

256
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:44,960
Shut up! Who would believe such nonsense?

257
00:22:44,960 --> 00:22:47,820
Grand Empress Dowager, all the bodies that have been found

258
00:22:47,820 --> 00:22:50,480
have been treated with cinnabar to delay decomposition,

259
00:22:50,480 --> 00:22:53,800
resulting in the inaccurate estimated time of death.

260
00:22:53,800 --> 00:22:56,260
Later, we deduced the correct date of death.

261
00:22:56,260 --> 00:23:01,900
Astonishingly, we found they were all during the Mizar Festival calculated by the Astronomical Bureau.

262
00:23:07,160 --> 00:23:09,160
Madam Tang,

263
00:23:09,160 --> 00:23:14,700
are you really doing all this just to vent your hatred?

264
00:23:14,700 --> 00:23:20,300
At first, I was guessing you did it based on the similarities in their faces.

265
00:23:20,300 --> 00:23:26,380
But later I discovered that it involved much more about a deep fixation on their status.

266
00:23:26,380 --> 00:23:29,520
I think the women you killed

267
00:23:29,520 --> 00:23:32,680
were mostly associated with someone very close to you.

268
00:23:32,680 --> 00:23:34,240
Shut up!

269
00:23:34,240 --> 00:23:36,040
Have you suffered any trauma?

270
00:23:36,040 --> 00:23:40,180
Or perhaps, did you have any emotional entanglements with other men

271
00:23:40,180 --> 00:23:43,340
that occurred on Mizar Festival?

272
00:23:48,660 --> 00:23:50,720
Nonsense!

273
00:23:50,720 --> 00:23:54,140
If you want to accuse someone falsely, you can always find a reason.

274
00:23:54,140 --> 00:23:58,560
Right, a few days ago, my husband caught a cold at night.

275
00:23:58,560 --> 00:24:02,580
The weather has turned colder recently, so you must take care.

276
00:24:07,160 --> 00:24:09,420
It's much better now.

277
00:24:09,420 --> 00:24:12,440
If you take any more care of me,

278
00:24:12,440 --> 00:24:15,160
I won't catch a cold.

279
00:24:16,760 --> 00:24:18,040
But you…

280
00:24:18,040 --> 00:24:22,180
You have been frightened; why don’t you rest well?

281
00:24:22,180 --> 00:24:24,580
I am...

282
00:24:25,480 --> 00:24:27,740
worried about you.

283
00:24:28,240 --> 00:24:31,500
Great Chief, you really treat the Imperial Guards as your home.

284
00:24:31,500 --> 00:24:36,200
Madam Shen has taken this place as if it were her own bedroom.

285
00:24:36,720 --> 00:24:42,340
Seeing the deep affection between you both, I am very pleased.

286
00:24:42,340 --> 00:24:47,240
But, Madam Shen, the case is of great importance right now.

287
00:24:47,240 --> 00:24:49,940
You need to handle the investigation with discretion.

288
00:24:49,940 --> 00:24:52,680
Yes, I'm sorry.

289
00:24:59,920 --> 00:25:02,660
Marshal Xu Xiangren requests an audience.

290
00:25:11,040 --> 00:25:12,640
I'm Xu Xiangren.

291
00:25:12,640 --> 00:25:14,980
Greetings to the Grand Empress Dowager.

292
00:25:16,260 --> 00:25:17,930
Sixth Miss.

293
00:25:19,280 --> 00:25:21,360
I take my leave.

294
00:25:25,880 --> 00:25:30,300
Another pair of male and female bodies were dug up at the inspector's place.

295
00:25:31,960 --> 00:25:36,280
This is the reconstruction portrait of the male victim's face that I have made.

296
00:25:43,680 --> 00:25:47,080
You give it to me!

297
00:25:47,680 --> 00:25:50,100
Give it to me!

298
00:25:54,800 --> 00:25:56,940
Just as expected.

299
00:25:57,840 --> 00:26:00,760
In your mind, you are the victim. Right?

300
00:26:00,760 --> 00:26:03,240
You know nothing.

301
00:26:09,680 --> 00:26:12,040
This is not my fault.

302
00:26:12,040 --> 00:26:14,560
They betrayed me first.

303
00:26:14,560 --> 00:26:17,320
It's them…

304
00:26:17,320 --> 00:26:20,740
This is all their fault.

305
00:26:21,680 --> 00:26:23,800
I treated him so well.

306
00:26:23,800 --> 00:26:27,380
Why did he betray me?

307
00:26:28,280 --> 00:26:32,680
The one you're talking about is the person in the portrait,

308
00:26:32,680 --> 00:26:35,260
your first husband.

309
00:26:35,260 --> 00:26:37,740
It is him.

310
00:26:48,640 --> 00:26:50,920
During my childhood,

311
00:26:51,800 --> 00:26:55,100
my younger sister was kidnapped.

312
00:26:55,800 --> 00:26:58,080
When we met,

313
00:26:58,080 --> 00:27:04,280
she had become a courtesan who was skilled at pipa.

314
00:27:04,280 --> 00:27:08,900
At that time, I was already married.

315
00:27:08,900 --> 00:27:14,080
But I never expected on the Mizar Festival…

316
00:27:15,920 --> 00:27:18,840
On the Mizar Festival, I discovered

317
00:27:18,840 --> 00:27:21,900
she was having an affair with my husband.

318
00:27:21,900 --> 00:27:23,760
The two people I loved the most.

319
00:27:23,760 --> 00:27:25,920
The two people I trusted the most.

320
00:27:25,920 --> 00:27:28,780
Both betrayed me.

321
00:27:28,780 --> 00:27:33,080
To save face, I gave her a cup of poisoned wine.

322
00:27:33,080 --> 00:27:40,200
But unexpectedly, my husband drank the wine.

323
00:27:40,200 --> 00:27:42,008
 No! 

324
00:27:44,560 --> 00:27:46,920
After my husband passed away,

325
00:27:46,920 --> 00:27:49,180
my younger sister also disappeared.

326
00:27:49,180 --> 00:27:53,540
I really looked for her for a very long time.

327
00:27:54,480 --> 00:27:58,920
In the end, I found her in a grave.

328
00:28:02,520 --> 00:28:08,920
The two of them were still tightly embracing each other!

329
00:28:18,060 --> 00:28:19,720
No.

330
00:28:21,320 --> 00:28:23,240
It's not like that.

331
00:28:23,240 --> 00:28:25,012
It's not like this.

332
00:28:26,080 --> 00:28:27,400
It's not like that.

333
00:28:27,400 --> 00:28:28,680
It's not like that.

334
00:28:28,680 --> 00:28:33,700
That despicable woman wasn't my younger sister at all.

335
00:28:33,700 --> 00:28:40,740
She was just a courtesan who seduced my husband.

336
00:28:40,740 --> 00:28:42,040
She deserved to die.

337
00:28:42,040 --> 00:28:43,600
She did not choose to be a decent person,

338
00:28:43,600 --> 00:28:45,880
instead, she seduced my husband.

339
00:28:45,880 --> 00:28:47,520
She deserved to be torn to pieces.

340
00:28:47,520 --> 00:28:49,480
She deserved to be skinned and deboned.

341
00:28:49,480 --> 00:28:53,980
She deserved to be humiliated by the world and laughed at by everyone.

342
00:28:53,980 --> 00:28:59,020
So you killed those who resembled your younger sister?

343
00:29:04,720 --> 00:29:06,512
 Does it look good? 

344
00:29:07,840 --> 00:29:09,676
 Pretty. 

345
00:29:11,960 --> 00:29:13,280
They deserved to die.

346
00:29:13,280 --> 00:29:15,800
And those despicable men!

347
00:29:15,800 --> 00:29:20,580
Why do they always love those courtesans?

348
00:29:20,580 --> 00:29:25,660
In this world, not everyone has the right to choose their own life.

349
00:29:25,660 --> 00:29:28,080
Among them, many were born in the music house

350
00:29:28,080 --> 00:29:31,620
and can only serve others with beauty, without any choice.

351
00:29:31,620 --> 00:29:35,880
Moreover, you can't kill others for this reason.

352
00:29:40,880 --> 00:29:43,320
Actually, at first,

353
00:29:44,920 --> 00:29:47,340
I also blamed myself.

354
00:29:48,040 --> 00:29:52,720
If it weren't for me, my younger sister wouldn't have died,

355
00:29:53,520 --> 00:29:56,240
nor would my husband.

356
00:29:56,240 --> 00:29:59,000
If it weren't for my momentary lapse in judgment...

357
00:29:59,000 --> 00:30:04,660
I wouldn't have lost both my loved ones at the same time.

358
00:30:04,660 --> 00:30:07,000
So, you regret it.

359
00:30:07,000 --> 00:30:12,460
You put those bodies in a hug pose to fulfill their wish.

360
00:30:12,460 --> 00:30:14,520
Madam Shen,

361
00:30:15,480 --> 00:30:18,200
you're indeed smart.

362
00:30:18,200 --> 00:30:20,720
You hit the nail on the head.

363
00:30:20,720 --> 00:30:26,500
But do you think that with your wisdom,

364
00:30:26,500 --> 00:30:30,280
you can forever win a man's heart?

365
00:30:42,320 --> 00:30:44,920
Do you think he's going to keep protecting you like that?

366
00:30:44,920 --> 00:30:46,480
He says he loves you,

367
00:30:46,480 --> 00:30:48,800
but he only loves himself.

368
00:30:48,800 --> 00:30:50,480
He will surely deceive you,

369
00:30:50,480 --> 00:30:54,040
breaking your heart into pieces and making you feel like life is worse than death.

370
00:30:54,040 --> 00:30:55,720
What's wrong with loving yourself?

371
00:30:55,720 --> 00:30:59,060
Everyone should love themselves before they love others.

372
00:31:01,440 --> 00:31:04,940
Between a couple, it should never be one-sided taking,

373
00:31:04,940 --> 00:31:06,780
nor should it be one-sided protection.

374
00:31:06,780 --> 00:31:10,400
A couple should weather the storm and face challenges together.

375
00:31:10,400 --> 00:31:13,100
That's what a family should be.

376
00:31:50,440 --> 00:31:53,760
Grand Empress Dowager, the truth is now clear.

377
00:31:53,760 --> 00:31:56,200
And the murderer has confessed to her crime.

378
00:31:56,200 --> 00:31:58,960
As for how to deal with Madam Tang,

379
00:31:58,960 --> 00:32:01,480
I defer to Your Majesty's judgment.

380
00:32:01,480 --> 00:32:06,240
Grand Empress Dowager, in my opinion, the murderer has become insane.

381
00:32:06,240 --> 00:32:08,900
Please do not let old sentiments cloud your judgment, Your Majesty,

382
00:32:08,900 --> 00:32:11,560
and close the case quickly.

383
00:32:13,160 --> 00:32:16,320
Considering she is the widow of a loyal official,

384
00:32:16,320 --> 00:32:18,940
leave her an intact body.

385
00:32:25,500 --> 00:32:27,104
Yes.

386
00:32:43,320 --> 00:32:48,640
Like a moth to a flame, live at dawn, die at dusk.

387
00:32:48,640 --> 00:32:53,860
Not entering the cycle of reincarnation, undying.

388
00:32:53,860 --> 00:32:55,440
Jing Lin, put out the fire.

389
00:32:55,440 --> 00:32:57,104
Yes.

390
00:32:59,940 --> 00:33:04,780
Isn't that what Chen Huo'e said before she died five years ago?

391
00:33:07,000 --> 00:33:10,200
- Take this madwoman away. 
  - Yes. 

392
00:33:37,820 --> 00:33:41,020
Have you been this nosy since you were a kid?

393
00:33:41,020 --> 00:33:45,300
It's a matter of life and death. How can you say so?

394
00:33:45,960 --> 00:33:49,820
I know. You asked Chuichui to keep an eye on me.

395
00:33:49,820 --> 00:33:54,560
But if I hadn't gone there, how could Madam Tang's case be that easily settled?

396
00:33:54,560 --> 00:33:56,404
Today...

397
00:34:05,420 --> 00:34:07,140
you did well.

398
00:34:11,160 --> 00:34:15,200
Aren't you going to scold me?

399
00:34:16,040 --> 00:34:20,720
Another pair of male and female bodies dug up. It's what you made up yourself. Right?

400
00:34:20,720 --> 00:34:24,859
I asked Brother Xu to get the portrait of Madam Tang's  first husband,

401
00:34:24,859 --> 00:34:28,400
in order to provoke her into telling the truth.

402
00:34:28,400 --> 00:34:30,500
The truth is clear now.

403
00:34:31,560 --> 00:34:33,679
But…

404
00:34:33,679 --> 00:34:39,040
But we're missing something in this case.

405
00:34:39,040 --> 00:34:41,600
What exactly are we missing?

406
00:34:47,920 --> 00:34:49,920
The hearts.

407
00:34:49,920 --> 00:34:54,540
Madam Tang has killed so many people and all the deceased had their hearts taken out.

408
00:34:54,540 --> 00:34:57,440
So where have all those hearts gone?

409
00:35:16,660 --> 00:35:20,700
Madam Tang, I have something important to ask you.

410
00:35:24,320 --> 00:35:28,980
Murder is easy. Moving the body, digging a hole, and reburying

411
00:35:28,980 --> 00:35:31,780
are not something a woman could easily do.

412
00:35:31,780 --> 00:35:33,320
You must have had help.

413
00:35:33,320 --> 00:35:37,220
To go to such great lengths, what's it really for?

414
00:35:37,220 --> 00:35:39,940
Like a moth to a flame.

415
00:35:44,600 --> 00:35:47,300
Like a moth to a flame.

416
00:35:54,400 --> 00:35:56,100
She's gone mad.

417
00:35:57,040 --> 00:35:59,720
She's very important.

418
00:36:00,400 --> 00:36:02,960
How can she be mad?

419
00:36:07,080 --> 00:36:10,080
I will never die.

420
00:36:10,080 --> 00:36:15,340
I will become a moth and live forever.

421
00:36:18,140 --> 00:36:21,220
Flying.

422
00:36:21,220 --> 00:36:24,040
You've killed so many people, where have all the hearts gone?

423
00:36:24,040 --> 00:36:25,600
I'm flying.

424
00:36:25,600 --> 00:36:27,860
- Meng Ceran. 
 - I'm flying.

425
00:36:39,340 --> 00:36:41,880
Please burn me to death.

426
00:36:41,880 --> 00:36:44,480
Please, I want to be reborn from the flames.

427
00:36:44,480 --> 00:36:48,060
I want to be reborn from the flames. Please. Please.

428
00:36:48,060 --> 00:36:52,880
No need to ask. Whatever a madwoman says lacks credibility.

429
00:36:52,880 --> 00:36:57,120
- Burn me. Burn me now. 
 - She will be executed soon.

430
00:36:57,760 --> 00:36:59,740
Burn me.

431
00:36:59,740 --> 00:37:02,400
Burn me now.

432
00:37:17,300 --> 00:37:19,340
What are you thinking about?

433
00:37:21,900 --> 00:37:24,520
I'm thinking about Madam Tang's case.

434
00:37:24,520 --> 00:37:27,980
Her love turned into hatred and became her obsession.

435
00:37:27,980 --> 00:37:31,580
Yet it's a mix of love and hatred, which she can't let go of.

436
00:37:33,480 --> 00:37:36,000
It's so sad.

437
00:37:36,000 --> 00:37:41,320
A fool would indulge himself in a relationship.

438
00:37:41,320 --> 00:37:44,580
And in this world, fools often do evil deeds.

439
00:37:44,580 --> 00:37:46,780
What's there to be sad about?

440
00:37:48,700 --> 00:37:53,700
Yes. That sounds like something someone as smart as you would think.

441
00:37:53,700 --> 00:37:57,760
Great Chief, I am exhausted. I need to rest.

442
00:38:02,720 --> 00:38:08,060
Prince Xian has successfully completed the disaster relief affairs and will soon arrive safely at Xiang'an.

443
00:38:08,060 --> 00:38:10,160
That's good news.

444
00:38:13,800 --> 00:38:18,600
From now on, there's no need to wander over to the pigeon coop.

445
00:38:23,700 --> 00:38:26,200
I wonder who gave you that false information.

446
00:38:26,200 --> 00:38:29,180
But the secret letters from the Imperial Guards

447
00:38:29,180 --> 00:38:31,160
don't need carrier pigeons.

448
00:38:32,660 --> 00:38:34,720
I know that.

449
00:38:35,640 --> 00:38:41,520
Those pigeons in the coop all have soft feathers and are simply incapable of long-distance flight.

450
00:38:43,300 --> 00:38:47,620
But I have to wander around the mansion.

451
00:38:47,620 --> 00:38:51,240
You have your jobs. And I have my jobs.

452
00:38:51,240 --> 00:38:55,740
I have to pretend to do something. But no real action will be taken. Rest assured.

453
00:38:58,660 --> 00:39:02,660
Now you can believe that even a tiger will not eat its cubs.

454
00:39:02,660 --> 00:39:05,340
Let alone the strongest of them all.

455
00:39:05,340 --> 00:39:07,260
Stop it, I don't want to hear it.

456
00:39:07,260 --> 00:39:11,280
I don't want to hear what I shouldn't, lest trouble finds me.

457
00:39:14,340 --> 00:39:17,340
Right, I have something to tell you.

458
00:39:17,340 --> 00:39:19,360
The Ministry of Justice and the inspectors are holding a celebration banquet

459
00:39:19,360 --> 00:39:22,840
and have sent over invitations, inviting both you and me to attend.

460
00:39:24,400 --> 00:39:26,920
- I know. You won't go. 
 - I…

461
00:39:26,920 --> 00:39:29,440
I'm just letting you know.

462
00:39:37,480 --> 00:39:40,440
- Jing Lin. 
 - Yes, Great Chief.

463
00:39:41,780 --> 00:39:45,720
Tell Uncle Zhong to make another set

464
00:39:50,180 --> 00:39:52,240
of the light-blocking curtains.

465
00:39:52,240 --> 00:39:54,280
Yes, Great Chief.

466
00:40:16,780 --> 00:40:20,620
What beautiful flower buds. What a pity.

467
00:40:22,940 --> 00:40:25,840
- Your Highness. 
 - Sir.

468
00:40:25,840 --> 00:40:28,700
Your disaster relief and pacification efforts this time are of immense merit and hard work.

469
00:40:28,700 --> 00:40:33,640
I've heard that the Grand Empress Dowager will reward you greatly.

470
00:40:33,640 --> 00:40:37,020
Was your journey back peaceful?

471
00:40:42,240 --> 00:40:45,560
Rest assured. Imperial Guards escorted me throughout the journey.

472
00:40:45,560 --> 00:40:47,640
It was very safe.

473
00:40:48,500 --> 00:40:51,120
I have brought back some local specialties this time.

474
00:40:51,120 --> 00:40:54,260
Prepare one portion and let him take it back.

475
00:40:56,320 --> 00:40:58,900
Prepare another portion and send it to my imperial sister.

476
00:40:58,900 --> 00:41:02,860
It's my kindness to her.

477
00:41:02,860 --> 00:41:04,620
Yes.

478
00:41:05,940 --> 00:41:08,520
Your Highness, you are kind-hearted and love your sister.

479
00:41:08,520 --> 00:41:11,440
I am truly moved.

480
00:41:11,440 --> 00:41:16,740
But recently, Princess of Valor was involved in the case of Madam Tang.

481
00:41:16,740 --> 00:41:19,800
I am afraid she's having a difficult time these days.

482
00:41:22,500 --> 00:41:25,620
When I was on the way back, I also heard about this.

483
00:41:25,620 --> 00:41:29,440
She has always been on good terms with Madam Tang, and both support the poor scholars.

484
00:41:29,440 --> 00:41:34,100
But the public opinion now is very unfavorable towards them.

485
00:41:34,100 --> 00:41:37,660
Indeed. In the Madam Tang case,

486
00:41:37,660 --> 00:41:41,620
I didn't expect Sixth Miss Yan to make great contributions.

487
00:41:41,620 --> 00:41:45,320
I didn't expect this concubine's daughter would have

488
00:41:45,320 --> 00:41:49,580
some tactics at a critical moment.

489
00:41:54,160 --> 00:41:59,840
Prince Xian, do you think this Sixth Miss Yan could be…

490
00:42:00,760 --> 00:42:04,400
The one you value would naturally be excellent.

491
00:42:04,400 --> 00:42:10,320
I think she is the one

492
00:42:10,320 --> 00:42:13,160
who breaks the deadlock.

493
00:42:13,840 --> 00:42:15,660
This flower needs to be fertilized.

494
00:42:15,660 --> 00:42:17,679
   

495
00:42:19,620 --> 00:42:24,040
Your Highness, it seems many women are claiming illness

496
00:42:24,040 --> 00:42:26,480
and will not attend this Floral Banquet.

497
00:42:27,920 --> 00:42:29,690
Understood.

498
00:42:31,100 --> 00:42:33,260
Those who don't want to come,

499
00:42:34,760 --> 00:42:37,840
don't have to come anymore.

500
00:42:40,980 --> 00:42:44,300
Those who cannot be used by me…

501
