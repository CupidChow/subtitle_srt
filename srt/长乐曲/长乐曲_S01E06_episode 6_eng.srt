00:00:27,900 --> 00:00:32,000
 "Go Ahead Fearlessly" - Liu Yuning 

3
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:35,000
â™«  Grudges and karma, right and wrong  â™«

4
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:38,200
â™«  The past hides blood and tears  â™«

5
00:00:38,200 --> 00:00:40,600
â™«  It is hard to catch up after years of separation  â™«

6
00:00:40,600 --> 00:00:44,500
â™«  The truth cannot be fully revealed  â™«

7
00:00:44,500 --> 00:00:47,600
â™«  Fate is full of twists and turns  â™«

8
00:00:47,600 --> 00:00:50,800
â™«  Life and death, fortune and misfortune go hand in hand  â™«

9
00:00:50,800 --> 00:00:55,800
â™«  Obsession is hard to get rid of, keeping the truth 
 and getting rid of the lies, let the wind blow  â™«

10
00:00:55,800 --> 00:01:02,200
â™«  Tossed about by the wind and rain, I will never regret it, 
 I will accompany you for my whole life  â™«

11
00:01:02,200 --> 00:01:08,600
â™«  At least you share my joy and sorrow  â™«

12
00:01:08,600 --> 00:01:14,800
â™«  Unravelling fate, fearlessly, a dream returns  â™«

13
00:01:14,800 --> 00:01:21,200
â™«  The mountains and rivers are bright and beautiful, 
 holding hands, together we return  â™«

14
00:01:21,200 --> 00:01:29,200
â™«  In this life, my heart returns untainted of dust and ash  â™«

15
00:01:29,200 --> 00:01:37,200
   

16
00:01:37,200 --> 00:01:40,300
   

17
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:43,300
   

18
00:02:02,600 --> 00:02:07,000
People can't always count on others to lend a helping hand.

19
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:11,200
We'd better rely on ourselves if possible.

20
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:20,100
A servant of the Yan family.

21
00:02:23,400 --> 00:02:24,400
Sixth Miss.

22
00:02:24,400 --> 00:02:27,200
Master sent me to remind you that three days have passed

23
00:02:27,200 --> 00:02:29,300
yet you still haven't visited your maiden home.

24
00:02:29,300 --> 00:02:30,800
You said you'd visit tomorrow.

25
00:02:30,800 --> 00:02:33,000
Please don't change your mind again.

26
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:36,600
All right. I understand.

27
00:02:49,200 --> 00:02:50,200
My sixth daughter.

28
00:02:50,200 --> 00:02:52,200
    
 Everyone in Xiang'an says

29
00:02:52,200 --> 00:02:55,000
that the Great Chief and you are deeply in love.

30
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:58,100
It brings so much honor to me.

31
00:02:58,100 --> 00:03:01,300
Pretty. So pretty.

32
00:03:03,200 --> 00:03:04,800
Is it good?

33
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:11,200
Pretty. So pretty.

34
00:03:13,500 --> 00:03:14,800
Sixth Miss,

35
00:03:14,800 --> 00:03:17,500
you finally came home after so many days.

36
00:03:17,500 --> 00:03:20,200
Why are you alone? Where is your husband?

37
00:03:20,200 --> 00:03:22,200
He has some urgent matters at work.

38
00:03:22,200 --> 00:03:24,300
The case matters more.

39
00:03:24,300 --> 00:03:26,400
How can a case matter more than you do?

40
00:03:26,400 --> 00:03:30,200
    
 How can a newly-wedded woman visit her maiden home alone?

41
00:03:33,760 --> 00:03:37,240
He'll come after work. Right?

42
00:03:42,400 --> 00:03:44,600
Fourth Sister, why did you come back today?

43
00:03:44,600 --> 00:03:47,300
Did you come back to see me?

44
00:03:49,200 --> 00:03:51,400
The bracelet my husband ordered for me arrived.

45
00:03:51,400 --> 00:03:53,600
I stopped by to see you.

46
00:03:53,600 --> 00:03:55,600
What about you?

47
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:03,800
Check out my bracelet. Isn't it pretty?

48
00:04:03,800 --> 00:04:05,300
I liked it at first sight.

49
00:04:05,300 --> 00:04:10,300
No matter what nasty things she says, just ignore her.

50
00:04:10,300 --> 00:04:14,100
What's so pretty about it? What a show-off.

51
00:04:15,120 --> 00:04:17,480
    
 Where is my brother-in-law?

52
00:04:18,400 --> 00:04:22,900
He told your sister to bring a lot of snacks and fruit.

53
00:04:24,500 --> 00:04:26,800
Feel free to have some.

54
00:04:33,680 --> 00:04:35,800
Here. Husband.

55
00:04:36,800 --> 00:04:42,200
Master, isn't our sixth daughter a poor girl?

56
00:04:42,200 --> 00:04:44,400
Others enjoy their married lives.

57
00:04:44,400 --> 00:04:48,900
But our sixth daughter has to work and do people justice.

58
00:04:56,800 --> 00:05:00,200
Where are you going with this?

59
00:05:00,200 --> 00:05:03,600
I've failed my job as a mother.

60
00:05:13,880 --> 00:05:15,680
Look at me.

61
00:05:15,700 --> 00:05:18,200
I can't do anything other than dressing up.

62
00:05:18,200 --> 00:05:20,200
I never do any work.

63
00:05:20,200 --> 00:05:23,500
And my husband says I bring luck to the family.

64
00:05:23,500 --> 00:05:28,400
I wanted to have a cute and sweet little girl.

65
00:05:28,400 --> 00:05:31,400
But I ended up giving birth to a pair of chubby twin boys.

66
00:05:31,400 --> 00:05:35,000
You have no idea how naughty the younger ones are.

67
00:05:35,900 --> 00:05:37,000
Sixth Miss,

68
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:40,800
meet your fourth sister more often to get some of her luck.

69
00:05:40,800 --> 00:05:44,600
Stop working all day and running around as a married woman.

70
00:05:44,600 --> 00:05:48,100
That's right, Sixth Sister. Stop doing menial jobs at the Ministry of Justice.

71
00:05:48,100 --> 00:05:49,400
I'm telling you.

72
00:05:49,400 --> 00:05:53,700
As a woman, how can you change your life?

73
00:05:53,700 --> 00:05:56,300
Run the Shen household well.

74
00:06:01,200 --> 00:06:02,500
Fifth Brother,

75
00:06:02,500 --> 00:06:04,500
I heard from my colleagues.

76
00:06:04,500 --> 00:06:07,400
Last time they patrolled the red-light district,

77
00:06:07,400 --> 00:06:10,200
they saw you drinking in a brothel.

78
00:06:10,200 --> 00:06:13,600
And chasing after the girls all over the place.

79
00:06:13,600 --> 00:06:15,500
Nonsense.

80
00:06:16,600 --> 00:06:18,500
You have the nerve to criticize me?

81
00:06:18,500 --> 00:06:20,400
You are a disgrace to the family.

82
00:06:20,400 --> 00:06:23,700
So sharp-tongued and mean.  Where is your feminine charm?

83
00:06:23,700 --> 00:06:25,800
I'm sharp-tongued and mean?

84
00:06:25,800 --> 00:06:29,200
If I were your husband, I'd rather visit the red-light district all day than see you.

85
00:06:29,200 --> 00:06:31,200
- Watch your mouth. 
 - That's enough.

86
00:06:31,200 --> 00:06:33,600
 Great Chief has arrived. 

87
00:06:50,700 --> 00:06:52,800
Greetings, Great Chief.

88
00:06:54,500 --> 00:06:58,600
But I think my wife is perfect.

89
00:07:15,100 --> 00:07:18,200
I got caught up in official duties.

90
00:07:18,200 --> 00:07:22,200
Father-in-law. Mother-in-law. Please forgive me.

91
00:07:22,200 --> 00:07:25,800
Don't mention it. It's just the right time.

92
00:07:25,800 --> 00:07:27,800
Yes. Exactly.

93
00:07:46,900 --> 00:07:53,100
I'd like to express my gratitude to you for having raised her so well.

94
00:07:55,300 --> 00:07:59,000
That's how she turned out so incredibly intelligent.

95
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:04,800
Come in.

96
00:08:26,700 --> 00:08:28,400
Father-in-law.

97
00:08:31,500 --> 00:08:36,000
My wife told me that you enjoy tea.

98
00:08:44,600 --> 00:08:49,400
This is a glazed sunflower-shaped porcelain cup from the Yue kiln.

99
00:08:52,200 --> 00:08:55,200
This is Zisun Tea bestowed by Her Majesty.

100
00:08:55,200 --> 00:08:58,200
These are way too valuable.

101
00:08:58,200 --> 00:09:01,200
You're blessed to have your sixth daughter.

102
00:09:01,960 --> 00:09:04,360
Even the Princess of Valor said...

103
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:08,300
that I had found a good wife.

104
00:09:09,360 --> 00:09:11,480
Princess of Valor?

105
00:09:36,800 --> 00:09:39,100
Pan Yanzhi?

106
00:09:43,600 --> 00:09:46,200
I thought all his calligraphy works had vanished.

107
00:09:46,200 --> 00:09:48,200
It's an imitation.

108
00:09:48,200 --> 00:09:49,500
A few years ago,

109
00:09:49,500 --> 00:09:52,200
I obtained rubbings of Pan Yanzhi's works by chance

110
00:09:52,200 --> 00:09:55,500
and imitated the brushwork on a whim.

111
00:09:56,300 --> 00:09:58,200
Even you were amazed.

112
00:09:58,200 --> 00:10:00,800
It must truly be indistinguishable.

113
00:10:00,800 --> 00:10:06,000
It seems you learned to mimic handwriting from your father.

114
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:08,800
I merely know the basics.

115
00:10:08,800 --> 00:10:13,400
But there isn't a handwriting my father can't imitate in this world.

116
00:10:16,200 --> 00:10:19,700
It's just calligraphy. It's not worth mentioning.

117
00:10:20,600 --> 00:10:24,100
Son-in-law, come here. Let's eat together.

118
00:10:24,100 --> 00:10:26,900
Son-in-law, come on.

119
00:10:29,200 --> 00:10:31,000
- Let's eat. 
 - Father.

120
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:34,200
We have many things to do at homeâ€”

121
00:10:37,200 --> 00:10:41,600
Since your father asked, we should stay for the meal.

122
00:10:45,320 --> 00:10:48,640
It's just that we need to return early...

123
00:10:51,280 --> 00:10:53,600
for some important matters.

124
00:10:54,800 --> 00:10:57,700
I get it. Totally.

125
00:11:44,200 --> 00:11:46,120
My sixth daughter.

126
00:11:46,120 --> 00:11:51,000
As your father, I am glad to see you having a good marital life.

127
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:52,920
It's just thatâ€¦

128
00:11:52,920 --> 00:11:55,280
Did Prime Minister Zhang talk to you?

129
00:11:55,280 --> 00:12:00,820
He has spoken to me many times with clear implications.

130
00:12:00,820 --> 00:12:03,660
The assignment to Xichen hasn't been settled yet.

131
00:12:03,660 --> 00:12:06,380
If his affair isn't handled well,

132
00:12:06,380 --> 00:12:08,640
thenâ€¦

133
00:12:08,640 --> 00:12:12,020
Leave it to me. I'll handle it properly.

134
00:12:44,120 --> 00:12:46,800
Big pigeons with fluffy feathers.

135
00:12:46,800 --> 00:12:49,640
Fallen feathers in the cage.

136
00:12:50,520 --> 00:12:52,280
Whatâ€¦

137
00:12:58,600 --> 00:13:01,160
 Yaya, stop! 

138
00:13:06,520 --> 00:13:08,160
Great Chief.

139
00:13:09,680 --> 00:13:11,480
Great Chief.

140
00:13:20,520 --> 00:13:22,840
Report to Great Chief.  Someone went to the pigeon coop.

141
00:13:22,840 --> 00:13:26,900
- Who was it? 
 - It was Madam.

142
00:13:26,900 --> 00:13:29,306
 She made a choice, after all. 

143
00:13:29,306 --> 00:13:31,703
   

144
00:13:56,120 --> 00:13:57,320
My Lord.

145
00:13:57,320 --> 00:14:02,560
The curtains you had me prepare a few days ago are ready.

146
00:14:10,360 --> 00:14:13,660
It's a special fabric made in Xichen

147
00:14:13,660 --> 00:14:16,200
that blocks the light perfectly.

148
00:14:16,200 --> 00:14:19,880
My Lord asked for this specificallyâ€”

149
00:14:29,360 --> 00:14:31,520
It's just right...

150
00:14:39,040 --> 00:14:41,420
for sword practice.

151
00:14:55,320 --> 00:14:57,668
What a waste.

152
00:15:00,280 --> 00:15:02,600
You'd better contain your temper.

153
00:15:02,600 --> 00:15:04,120
So moody.

154
00:15:04,120 --> 00:15:07,000
Who's going to be willing to serve you?

155
00:15:08,360 --> 00:15:12,000
At the Yan Mansion, who swore by oath...

156
00:15:15,800 --> 00:15:18,640
to serve me well?

157
00:15:31,280 --> 00:15:34,320
You keep avoiding me.

158
00:15:34,320 --> 00:15:37,000
How can you serve me well?

159
00:15:53,320 --> 00:15:56,480
Do you really want me to serve you?

160
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:05,400
We are married, after all.

161
00:16:05,400 --> 00:16:07,960
Even if something were to happen,

162
00:16:07,960 --> 00:16:10,820
no one could say anything.

163
00:16:13,520 --> 00:16:16,480
Do I look like I'm afraid of gossip?

164
00:16:19,840 --> 00:16:24,960
It is only right for a wife to attend to her husband.

165
00:16:27,960 --> 00:16:30,520
All right. Fine.

166
00:16:30,520 --> 00:16:32,720
I'll serve you.

167
00:16:45,320 --> 00:16:46,840
Husband, you smell so nice.

168
00:16:46,840 --> 00:16:50,280
Would you like to have a sniff of me, as well?

169
00:17:19,640 --> 00:17:22,040
Giving me a hard time?

170
00:17:36,800 --> 00:17:37,920
Guards.

171
00:17:37,920 --> 00:17:41,860
Light up the lamps by Madam's side.

172
00:17:55,640 --> 00:17:58,720
Great Chief, something happened at the Ximing Temple.

173
00:18:11,240 --> 00:18:12,560
We have enough manpower.

174
00:18:12,560 --> 00:18:15,720
The Great Chief wants you to go back to the Ministry of Justice.

175
00:18:16,480 --> 00:18:20,080
Iâ€¦ It's not like I want to follow you.

176
00:18:20,080 --> 00:18:23,680
Don't come back begging me for assistance.

177
00:18:39,338 --> 00:18:41,960
   

178
00:18:41,960 --> 00:18:43,680
Neat handwriting.

179
00:18:43,680 --> 00:18:45,160
Outstanding brushwork.

180
00:18:45,160 --> 00:18:48,860
These bloody words appeared on the wall out of thin air?

181
00:18:59,960 --> 00:19:01,080
It's not blood.

182
00:19:01,080 --> 00:19:04,640
It's a special kind of ink made of minerals mixed with cinnabar.

183
00:19:04,640 --> 00:19:06,400
Once applied on the wall,

184
00:19:06,400 --> 00:19:09,660
it doesn't show immediately and only turns red after the rain.

185
00:19:09,660 --> 00:19:13,420
The culprit wrote it long ago and waited for last night's rain.

186
00:19:13,420 --> 00:19:16,480
The Buddha statue in the main hall shed blood tears.

187
00:19:16,480 --> 00:19:18,800
Why did the culprit do this?

188
00:19:26,120 --> 00:19:28,440
He was provoking us.

189
00:19:28,440 --> 00:19:30,540
Buddha was enraged and shed blood tears.

190
00:19:30,540 --> 00:19:34,980
I heard the statues would shed blood tears to lament the coldness of the world.

191
00:19:34,980 --> 00:19:37,840
This is a warning to the people.

192
00:20:13,560 --> 00:20:17,280
Sorry about that.  I wasn't paying attention.

193
00:20:24,960 --> 00:20:25,960
Sixth Miss Yan,

194
00:20:25,960 --> 00:20:29,100
our Ministry of Justice really can't do without you.

195
00:20:29,100 --> 00:20:30,360
You have no idea.

196
00:20:30,360 --> 00:20:35,300
The floor here stopped being shiny.

197
00:20:44,120 --> 00:20:45,650
My Lord.

198
00:20:46,160 --> 00:20:48,200
Good morning, My Lord.

199
00:20:52,480 --> 00:20:54,280
Isn't this the wife of the Great Chief?

200
00:20:54,280 --> 00:20:56,800
Why is she cleaning the floor here?

201
00:20:56,800 --> 00:20:58,160
Exactly.

202
00:20:58,160 --> 00:20:59,960
This is inappropriate.

203
00:20:59,960 --> 00:21:04,280
Here. It's still a bit dirty.

204
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:19,320
Wash that rag well before wiping the floor.

205
00:21:22,520 --> 00:21:26,140
My Lord, your belt has fallen. Your belt has fallen.

206
00:21:39,500 --> 00:21:41,440
You two quarreled?

207
00:21:42,510 --> 00:21:44,980
- No. 
 - No?

208
00:21:44,980 --> 00:21:47,740
Then why did you suddenly come back?

209
00:21:49,560 --> 00:21:53,000
Just tell me. What have you done again?

210
00:21:55,660 --> 00:21:59,280
I gained weight again.  I have to exercise more.

211
00:22:05,260 --> 00:22:07,960
I became a spy.

212
00:22:07,960 --> 00:22:09,980
Are you suiâ€”

213
00:22:12,180 --> 00:22:13,820
Are you suicidal?

214
00:22:13,820 --> 00:22:18,220
I heard that a spy once sneaked into the Shen Mansion at midnight.

215
00:22:18,220 --> 00:22:20,980
By sunrise, not only did he disappear,

216
00:22:20,980 --> 00:22:23,640
but his whole familyâ€”

217
00:22:25,960 --> 00:22:28,560
His whole family disappeared.

218
00:22:28,560 --> 00:22:30,880
Moreover, at midnight,

219
00:22:30,880 --> 00:22:34,420
someone saw that the soul collector dragged them

220
00:22:34,420 --> 00:22:36,200
into the Palace of Death.

221
00:22:36,200 --> 00:22:38,180
You may get your whole family killed.

222
00:22:38,180 --> 00:22:40,540
You're way too bold.

223
00:22:41,520 --> 00:22:43,520
Wellâ€¦

224
00:22:45,200 --> 00:22:48,460
It's very complicated.

225
00:22:48,460 --> 00:22:51,720
Right. How did it go with Brother Xu?

226
00:22:51,720 --> 00:22:55,700
Rest assured. Marshal Xu has put some inspectors on it.

227
00:22:55,700 --> 00:22:57,660
My Lord, excuse me for a second.

228
00:22:57,660 --> 00:22:58,860
It's fine.

229
00:22:58,860 --> 00:23:02,200
Sixth Miss Yan, I forgot to tell you something.

230
00:23:02,200 --> 00:23:05,100
Your master returned from his travels. Someone spotted him.

231
00:23:05,100 --> 00:23:08,960
But the Imperial Guards arrested him the moment he entered the city.

232
00:23:08,960 --> 00:23:10,836
What?

233
00:23:25,140 --> 00:23:27,280
Get your Great Chief here!

234
00:23:27,280 --> 00:23:30,980
Shen Du! Shen Du!

235
00:23:34,900 --> 00:23:35,470
Shen Duâ€”

236
00:23:35,470 --> 00:23:36,640
The Great Chief is busy and unavailable.

237
00:23:36,640 --> 00:23:40,020
I am the wife of your chief. Who dares to stop me?

238
00:23:40,620 --> 00:23:42,240
Shen Du, come out!

239
00:23:42,240 --> 00:23:43,800
Kick her out.

240
00:23:43,800 --> 00:23:46,000
Shen Du, come after me if you have a problem.

241
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:48,340
Why did you arrest my master?

242
00:23:49,480 --> 00:23:51,860
Donâ€™t think too highly of yourself.

243
00:23:51,860 --> 00:23:54,140
You're overestimating your worth.

244
00:23:54,140 --> 00:23:55,560
Release my master!

245
00:23:55,560 --> 00:23:58,440
    
 Shen Du, let my master go.

246
00:23:58,440 --> 00:24:01,120
- Sixth Miss. 
 - Release my master.

247
00:24:02,400 --> 00:24:04,396
Master.

248
00:24:20,200 --> 00:24:24,580
Look at you. You've gotten married yet you're still reckless.

249
00:24:24,580 --> 00:24:27,080
Master.

250
00:24:27,080 --> 00:24:28,840
Please drink less,

251
00:24:28,840 --> 00:24:32,580
especially not what is offered to you.

252
00:24:32,600 --> 00:24:35,360
My disciple often speaks her mind.

253
00:24:35,360 --> 00:24:37,620
Please don't mind her.

254
00:24:37,620 --> 00:24:41,700
- I know. 
 - What do you know? Iâ€¦

255
00:24:46,240 --> 00:24:47,580
That's it for the game.

256
00:24:47,580 --> 00:24:52,500
Go ahead. What do you want to ask me?

257
00:24:52,500 --> 00:24:55,340
I heard that you've developed a unique cinnabar

258
00:24:55,340 --> 00:24:57,700
which turns visible only with water.

259
00:24:57,700 --> 00:25:02,320
That's right. I developed it to prevent the corpses from decomposing.

260
00:25:02,320 --> 00:25:06,420
I wonder if only you have access to this special cinnabar?

261
00:25:06,420 --> 00:25:08,080
Before I retired,

262
00:25:08,080 --> 00:25:12,780
I had given the formula to the servants of a few old friends for pest control.

263
00:25:12,780 --> 00:25:14,540
It worked really well.

264
00:25:14,540 --> 00:25:17,480
Please tell me their names.

265
00:25:17,480 --> 00:25:19,040
I see.

266
00:25:19,040 --> 00:25:21,340
This is why the time of disappearance

267
00:25:21,340 --> 00:25:24,440
differs so much from the time of death.

268
00:25:25,080 --> 00:25:28,360
Delay the decomposition. Repel the insects.

269
00:25:29,920 --> 00:25:31,420
That's right, it's the cinnabar.

270
00:25:31,420 --> 00:25:33,400
There were herbs around the corpses.

271
00:25:33,400 --> 00:25:36,200
We thought it was meant to cover the stench.

272
00:25:36,200 --> 00:25:39,300
But in fact, it was mixed with an anti-decomposition cinnabar.

273
00:25:39,300 --> 00:25:42,840
That's why the coroner got the time of death wrong.

274
00:25:45,880 --> 00:25:48,260
Master.

275
00:25:50,940 --> 00:25:54,920
Master Chen, could you deduce the actual time of death?

276
00:25:54,920 --> 00:25:59,560
What kind of disciple would exhaust their master?

277
00:25:59,560 --> 00:26:02,440
Master, we have a case to solve.

278
00:26:02,440 --> 00:26:05,980
Please do us a favor and show us what you've got.

279
00:26:05,980 --> 00:26:09,120
My master has won this game.

280
00:26:10,160 --> 00:26:13,724
I won? I won.

281
00:26:14,440 --> 00:26:17,900
- Let's go then. Take me to the morgue. 
 -  Let's go.

282
00:26:18,460 --> 00:26:21,010
- Master, be careful. 
 - To the morgue.

283
00:26:32,960 --> 00:26:35,020
Judging from the level of decomposition,

284
00:26:35,020 --> 00:26:38,440
my master deduced the time of death.

285
00:26:39,000 --> 00:26:41,400
Early spring, fourth year of Shengli Era. Midsummer, same year.

286
00:26:41,400 --> 00:26:44,000
Second or third month of the fifth year. Sixth month of the sixth year.

287
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:46,340
In the middle of the eighth month of the sixth year.

288
00:26:47,640 --> 00:26:49,640
Can't you narrow it down a bit more?

289
00:26:49,640 --> 00:26:53,020
I don't think it's necessary.

290
00:26:55,160 --> 00:26:58,960
These are found in the stomachs of the male victims.

291
00:26:59,720 --> 00:27:01,880
Judging from the level of decomposition,

292
00:27:01,880 --> 00:27:04,840
we believed that even if the victims had eaten something,

293
00:27:04,840 --> 00:27:08,860
the contents in their stomachs would have decomposed along with the body.

294
00:27:09,460 --> 00:27:11,480
I was too hasty.

295
00:27:15,800 --> 00:27:19,320
A forensic shouldn't hold predetermine conclusions.

296
00:27:19,320 --> 00:27:22,120
The more bizarre and shocking the case,

297
00:27:22,120 --> 00:27:24,760
the more we must proceed methodically.

298
00:27:24,760 --> 00:27:28,560
The key often lies in

299
00:27:28,560 --> 00:27:32,920
some inconspicuous details.

300
00:27:40,240 --> 00:27:42,070
Seeds.

301
00:27:43,260 --> 00:27:45,000
That's right.

302
00:27:47,640 --> 00:27:49,780
Seeds can only be digested and expelled

303
00:27:49,780 --> 00:27:51,960
through bowel movement when a person is alive.

304
00:27:51,960 --> 00:27:54,800
And the whole process takes less than a day.

305
00:27:54,800 --> 00:27:57,220
All these victims had seeds in their stomachs.

306
00:27:57,220 --> 00:28:00,840
It means they were killed shortly after eating these.

307
00:28:02,680 --> 00:28:06,440
What makes sense may not necessarily be the truth.

308
00:28:06,440 --> 00:28:09,840
Sometimes, what you see with your own eyes

309
00:28:09,840 --> 00:28:12,240
may not necessarily be the truth.

310
00:28:12,240 --> 00:28:15,120
There is a high chance that someone has used tricks

311
00:28:15,120 --> 00:28:19,680
to make you believe that it's the truth.

312
00:28:19,680 --> 00:28:20,900
I am enlightened.

313
00:28:20,900 --> 00:28:22,280
What a coincidence.

314
00:28:22,280 --> 00:28:25,940
All these male victims had seeds before they died?

315
00:28:27,200 --> 00:28:29,960
When there are too many coincidences,

316
00:28:29,960 --> 00:28:33,180
it's no longer a coincidence.

317
00:28:35,880 --> 00:28:40,480
These seeds are not from ordinary melons, but gourds from Xichen.

318
00:28:40,480 --> 00:28:42,220
Tribute gourds from Xichen?

319
00:28:42,220 --> 00:28:44,840
- They're from the Imperial Palace. 
 - No.

320
00:28:44,840 --> 00:28:50,220
These noblemen had access to Xichen gourds on another occasion.

321
00:28:50,220 --> 00:28:53,260
The Mizar Festival.

322
00:28:54,820 --> 00:28:58,320
The Astronomical Bureau determines the date of the Mizar Festival every year.

323
00:28:58,320 --> 00:29:00,040
The feast is funded by the government.

324
00:29:00,040 --> 00:29:03,000
Empress Dowager gives out treasures during the feast.

325
00:29:03,000 --> 00:29:05,280
But the date differs every year.

326
00:29:05,280 --> 00:29:08,340
So when is the next Mizar Festival?

327
00:29:08,340 --> 00:29:10,728
In three days.

328
00:29:10,728 --> 00:29:14,050
   

329
00:29:18,040 --> 00:29:21,860
Great Chief, Grand Empress Dowager is still in a meeting.

330
00:29:21,860 --> 00:29:25,160
Please wait a little longer.

331
00:29:40,640 --> 00:29:42,120
The Buddha statue wept blood.

332
00:29:42,120 --> 00:29:46,480
Those rampant rumors gave the Grand Empress Dowager headaches.

333
00:29:46,480 --> 00:29:51,380
Even the Princess of Valor has been implicated and grounded.

334
00:29:53,800 --> 00:29:56,320
Empress Dowager has decreed.

335
00:30:00,200 --> 00:30:01,840
It is a critical situation.

336
00:30:01,840 --> 00:30:05,320
If the case is not solved within five days,

337
00:30:05,320 --> 00:30:07,880
it will be handed over to the Imperial Inspectorate.

338
00:30:07,880 --> 00:30:12,360
I accept Her Majesty's decree.

339
00:30:21,400 --> 00:30:25,580
You don't have to be so courteous to meet me every time.

340
00:30:25,580 --> 00:30:29,220
I heard something happened at Ximing Temple.

341
00:30:29,220 --> 00:30:30,600
It was plotted.

342
00:30:30,600 --> 00:30:32,600
This nursery rhyme is just the beginning.

343
00:30:32,600 --> 00:30:37,300
This matter is getting serious. Prince Xian is in deep trouble.

344
00:30:37,300 --> 00:30:39,680
Princess of Valor has also been grounded.

345
00:30:39,680 --> 00:30:42,940
Grand Empress Dowager meant to discipline all her children.

346
00:30:42,940 --> 00:30:44,310
Forgive me for asking this,

347
00:30:44,310 --> 00:30:46,960
The Buddha statue wept blood, does it have something to do with you, My Lord?

348
00:30:46,960 --> 00:30:49,044
How dare you?

349
00:30:54,920 --> 00:30:56,720
Forgive me for being abrupt.

350
00:30:56,720 --> 00:31:01,120
I just want to find out the truth to share your burden.

351
00:31:02,800 --> 00:31:06,240
I have nothing to do with this.

352
00:31:07,500 --> 00:31:12,000
However, how's it going with the investigation?

353
00:31:12,560 --> 00:31:13,740
I'm still clueless.

354
00:31:13,740 --> 00:31:15,120
How dare you make a fool of me?

355
00:31:15,120 --> 00:31:17,800
Aren't you afraid I'll kick your family out of officialdom?

356
00:31:17,800 --> 00:31:20,080
Please allow me to explain, My Lord.

357
00:31:20,080 --> 00:31:23,000
You asked me to check the pigeon coop to figure out

358
00:31:23,000 --> 00:31:25,240
what the Grand Empress Dowager thinks about Prince Xian.

359
00:31:25,240 --> 00:31:28,940
According to my investigation, you were being paranoid.

360
00:31:29,860 --> 00:31:31,480
How can you be sure?

361
00:31:31,480 --> 00:31:34,980
Besides the pigeon coop, communications between the Imperial Guards suddenly increased.

362
00:31:34,980 --> 00:31:37,360
Many of the messengers return midway.

363
00:31:37,360 --> 00:31:39,740
It's a method to conceal the real routes.

364
00:31:39,740 --> 00:31:43,080
Besides, many Imperial Guards have been mobilized.

365
00:31:43,080 --> 00:31:46,000
I believe their job is to keep Prince Xian safe.

366
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:48,620
Why would Her Majesty do so if she means to harm him?

367
00:31:48,620 --> 00:31:50,820
Even so,

368
00:31:51,460 --> 00:31:53,360
it's merely your assumption.

369
00:31:53,360 --> 00:31:57,780
Isn't it also a speculation that Prince Xian is in danger, My Lord?

370
00:32:03,880 --> 00:32:05,240
I'll trust you for now.

371
00:32:05,240 --> 00:32:08,800
However, I want a conclusion soon.

372
00:32:08,800 --> 00:32:09,920
Rest assured, My Lord.

373
00:32:09,920 --> 00:32:13,120
I will soon apprehend the mastermind behind this.

374
00:32:13,120 --> 00:32:15,440
Good to know.

375
00:32:15,440 --> 00:32:18,980
The assignment to the frontier is about to be issued.

376
00:32:18,980 --> 00:32:23,360
There isn't much time left for you and Academician Yan.

377
00:32:40,248 --> 00:32:41,480
   

378
00:32:41,480 --> 00:32:43,420
Grand Empress Dowager.

379
00:32:44,960 --> 00:32:49,960
If you don't play, I will win this game.

380
00:32:51,620 --> 00:32:53,920
All right.

381
00:32:53,920 --> 00:32:58,620
In that case, I will ask you for a reward.

382
00:32:58,620 --> 00:33:00,960
Sure, tell me.

383
00:33:00,960 --> 00:33:03,280
What would you like?

384
00:33:05,320 --> 00:33:07,000
Thanks to Your Majesty,

385
00:33:07,000 --> 00:33:11,180
the feast of the Mizar Festival will be held by me.

386
00:33:11,180 --> 00:33:14,340
Will you also allow me

387
00:33:14,340 --> 00:33:17,460
to decide whom to invite?

388
00:33:21,400 --> 00:33:25,340
In the past, we've always invited those who could recite poems,

389
00:33:25,340 --> 00:33:27,600
compose verses, and sing.

390
00:33:28,120 --> 00:33:33,560
This time, can we invite some real talents and beauties?

391
00:33:35,000 --> 00:33:39,160
Invite whoever you want.

392
00:33:39,160 --> 00:33:43,920
Have you taken a liking to some young ladies?

393
00:33:47,560 --> 00:33:51,100
I really appreciate it, Grand Empress Dowager.

394
00:33:57,480 --> 00:34:00,880
Official Xu, here's the list you gave me.

395
00:34:00,880 --> 00:34:04,380
I'm going to invite everyone on the list.

396
00:34:04,380 --> 00:34:06,980
- Thank you, Minister Zhang. 
 - Don't mention it.

397
00:34:06,980 --> 00:34:11,080
I'll count on you to look after me.

398
00:34:13,880 --> 00:34:18,300
In that case, everyone who knows the cinnabar formula is already on the invitation list

399
00:34:18,300 --> 00:34:20,800
for the Kaiyang Festival.

400
00:34:22,400 --> 00:34:25,000
The murderer is among them.

401
00:34:27,600 --> 00:34:32,600
It's not easy to find the murderer among these people.

402
00:34:32,600 --> 00:34:35,639
It might be better to have the murderer come to us.

403
00:34:35,639 --> 00:34:37,939
We can save ourselves a lot of trouble.

404
00:34:37,939 --> 00:34:42,160
The deceased women had similar ornaments.

405
00:34:42,160 --> 00:34:45,259
And they were courtesans skilled with pipa.

406
00:34:46,239 --> 00:34:50,480
If I disguise myself as one of them, I can attract the murderer's attention,

407
00:34:50,480 --> 00:34:52,199
then the murderer will naturally make a move.

408
00:34:52,199 --> 00:34:54,380
Then you can catch him on the spot.

409
00:34:54,380 --> 00:34:56,980
No way. This is too risky.

410
00:34:56,980 --> 00:34:58,560
I won't let you do this.

411
00:34:58,560 --> 00:34:59,880
Iâ€¦

412
00:34:59,880 --> 00:35:03,440
Get someone from Tongming Hall to dress up like the target.

413
00:35:03,440 --> 00:35:05,840
- Understood. 
 - No way.

414
00:35:06,880 --> 00:35:09,520
The courtesans of Tongming Hall are also civilians.

415
00:35:09,520 --> 00:35:11,720
How can we risk the lives of the civilians?

416
00:35:11,720 --> 00:35:14,580
Besides, that murderer is ruthless.

417
00:35:14,580 --> 00:35:17,080
If anything happens, how can you compensate her?

418
00:35:17,080 --> 00:35:19,680
So you know it's dangerous.

419
00:35:19,680 --> 00:35:23,560
If anything happens to you, what should I tell Grand Empress Dowager,

420
00:35:26,200 --> 00:35:29,380
as well as Prime Minister Zhang and Academician Yan?

421
00:35:42,760 --> 00:35:46,200
I strongly advocated for a thorough investigation of this case.

422
00:35:46,200 --> 00:35:49,380
If I hadn't intervened, it would have been closed long ago.

423
00:35:49,380 --> 00:35:51,200
Now we've reached the final step.

424
00:35:51,200 --> 00:35:53,580
I should put it to an end.

425
00:35:53,580 --> 00:35:58,140
A female official should take the risk to solve cases.

426
00:35:58,140 --> 00:36:00,360
You want me to risk the lives of civilians.

427
00:36:00,360 --> 00:36:02,280
I can't do that.

428
00:36:02,280 --> 00:36:06,360
Can't you tell if you're up to the mark to disguise as a target?

429
00:36:07,840 --> 00:36:09,800
They're skilled at playing the pipa.

430
00:36:09,800 --> 00:36:11,840
Are you?

431
00:37:04,040 --> 00:37:07,320
Madam turned out to be so talented.

432
00:37:10,120 --> 00:37:13,320
So? Am I skilled or not?

433
00:37:13,320 --> 00:37:16,360
You have exquisite skills.

434
00:37:21,560 --> 00:37:24,160
Go on and play another piece.

435
00:37:31,440 --> 00:37:33,680
I'm tired. Let's call it a day.

436
00:37:33,680 --> 00:37:36,520
Are you tired or you can't play?

437
00:37:38,580 --> 00:37:42,080
Are you planning to get by with these few verses

438
00:37:42,080 --> 00:37:45,240
at the Mizar Festival?

439
00:38:04,560 --> 00:38:06,900
I wasn't prepared for it.

440
00:38:06,900 --> 00:38:10,560
I'll speak whatever comes to mind that is important.

441
00:38:10,560 --> 00:38:12,320
First of all, when you playâ€¦

442
00:38:12,320 --> 00:38:15,040
This is the wrong outfit.

443
00:38:15,040 --> 00:38:18,300
You should wear something cooler.

444
00:38:19,040 --> 00:38:23,280
This may not be necessary.

445
00:38:23,280 --> 00:38:26,980
The key lies not in the melody or rhythm,

446
00:38:26,980 --> 00:38:29,960
but in the vibe.

447
00:38:31,120 --> 00:38:33,240
Watch me carefully.

448
00:38:33,240 --> 00:38:36,240
You know the postures. The very basics.

449
00:38:40,000 --> 00:38:42,376
Stretch your leg.

450
00:38:43,320 --> 00:38:44,720
Cross-legged.

451
00:38:44,720 --> 00:38:47,000
That's right. Take it slow.

452
00:38:47,000 --> 00:38:49,980
Spin. Spinning.

453
00:38:49,980 --> 00:38:54,160
Fluttering. Look how the skirt flies up.

454
00:38:54,160 --> 00:38:57,000
Let the skirt fly.

455
00:38:57,000 --> 00:38:59,320
Motherâ€¦

456
00:38:59,920 --> 00:39:01,520
Can you stay seated?

457
00:39:01,520 --> 00:39:02,920
You keep spinning.

458
00:39:02,920 --> 00:39:05,840
I can't even see your fingering.

459
00:39:06,520 --> 00:39:09,280
It doesn't matter.

460
00:39:09,280 --> 00:39:12,760
This is what matters. Watch closely.

461
00:39:12,760 --> 00:39:16,200
Raise your arms above your head.

462
00:39:18,720 --> 00:39:22,520
Bring them down from behind your head.

463
00:39:25,720 --> 00:39:28,440
Keep your posture enchanting. Show your face.

464
00:39:28,440 --> 00:39:29,840
Eyes. Look at my eyes.

465
00:39:29,840 --> 00:39:32,080
A woman's charm.

466
00:39:32,080 --> 00:39:33,640
Focus. Focus on the eyes.

467
00:39:33,640 --> 00:39:35,800
Look at my eyes.

468
00:39:39,600 --> 00:39:41,640
That's right, pay attention.

469
00:39:41,640 --> 00:39:43,800
Spin again.

470
00:39:48,640 --> 00:39:50,840
Give it a shake.

471
00:39:52,480 --> 00:39:57,180
Usually, this piece should have fallen to the ground.

472
00:39:58,960 --> 00:40:00,560
Mother.

473
00:40:00,560 --> 00:40:02,960
Dance later. Please sit down first.

474
00:40:02,960 --> 00:40:06,600
I just want to learn a piece of music.

475
00:40:06,600 --> 00:40:09,320
It's not about the quantity, but the quality.

476
00:40:09,320 --> 00:40:12,800
Back then, I mastered just one piece.

477
00:40:12,800 --> 00:40:16,340
A true master doesn't need a second piece at all.

478
00:40:16,340 --> 00:40:20,860
And your father never lasted until the second piece.

479
00:40:20,860 --> 00:40:23,240
Come on, Mother.

480
00:40:23,240 --> 00:40:26,120
What are you talking about?

481
00:40:26,120 --> 00:40:29,760
Once you play the pipa on the back like I taught you,

482
00:40:29,760 --> 00:40:32,400
men won't be able to contain themselves.

483
00:40:32,400 --> 00:40:33,920
Mother!

484
00:40:33,920 --> 00:40:37,940
I just want to learn a pipa piece to solve a case.

485
00:40:37,940 --> 00:40:40,320
What do you think I'm doing?

486
00:40:41,600 --> 00:40:44,560
I thought you wanted me to teach you

487
00:40:44,560 --> 00:40:48,180
some pipa moves to please your husband.

488
00:40:49,880 --> 00:40:51,880
You got me wrong.

489
00:40:55,720 --> 00:40:57,040
Uncle,

490
00:40:57,040 --> 00:40:59,900
what is my mother thinking about?

491
00:40:59,900 --> 00:41:01,280
Just because I got married,

492
00:41:01,280 --> 00:41:05,380
what I think and do must be about pleasing my husband?

493
00:41:05,380 --> 00:41:08,180
Your mother was sent to the opera troupe at an early age.

494
00:41:08,180 --> 00:41:13,500
The troupe leader taught us to be tolerant of everything,

495
00:41:13,500 --> 00:41:17,100
give up our self-esteem, and entertain our customers.

496
00:41:17,100 --> 00:41:19,760
Fortunately, your father took pity on her

497
00:41:19,760 --> 00:41:23,600
and provided her with a place to settle down.

498
00:41:24,160 --> 00:41:26,280
Therefore,

499
00:41:26,280 --> 00:41:30,340
the best future she could think for you...

500
00:41:30,880 --> 00:41:33,480
was to marry a nice man.

501
00:41:34,440 --> 00:41:36,280
Then, by my mother's standards,

502
00:41:36,280 --> 00:41:39,340
I certainly don't have a promising future.

503
00:41:39,340 --> 00:41:41,160
I'm not married to a nice man.

504
00:41:41,160 --> 00:41:43,200
Your mother has told me many times

505
00:41:43,200 --> 00:41:46,940
to keep you safe in the palace,

506
00:41:46,940 --> 00:41:49,920
lest the Whiteâ€¦

507
00:41:52,600 --> 00:41:55,940
your husband... endangers your life.

508
00:41:55,940 --> 00:42:00,560
But now that you are safe, she is relieved.

509
00:42:00,560 --> 00:42:06,240
But she spends her days thinking about how to secure your position as the main wife.

510
00:42:06,240 --> 00:42:08,200
She shouldn't be bothered.

511
00:42:08,200 --> 00:42:12,960
Whoever fancies this position can take it.

512
00:42:12,960 --> 00:42:15,490
I don't need a man's protection.

513
00:42:16,240 --> 00:42:21,780
I just hope that I can become powerful enough

514
00:42:21,780 --> 00:42:24,080
to protect myself and my family.

515
00:42:25,480 --> 00:42:29,600
I am fortunate to have been born into an age where women can be officials.

516
00:42:29,600 --> 00:42:31,600
Where there is no need for us to serve with our looks.

517
00:42:31,600 --> 00:42:36,600
It's just that I need to learn a pipa piece

518
00:42:36,600 --> 00:42:41,140
to captivate the attention of the entire audience.

519
00:42:43,240 --> 00:42:47,760
You said it was for a case.

520
00:42:48,640 --> 00:42:52,500
I need to perform a pipa song at Liushang Pavilion

521
00:42:52,500 --> 00:42:55,440
to lure the snake out of hiding.

522
