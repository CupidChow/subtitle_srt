00:00:27,090 --> 00:00:31,990
 "Go Ahead Fearlessly" - Liu Yuning 

3
00:00:31,991 --> 00:00:34,929
â™«  Grudges and karma, right and wrong  â™«

4
00:00:34,929 --> 00:00:38,227
â™«  The past hides blood and tears  â™«

5
00:00:38,227 --> 00:00:40,596
â™«  It is hard to catch up after years of separation  â™«

6
00:00:40,596 --> 00:00:44,471
â™«  The truth cannot be fully revealed  â™«

7
00:00:44,471 --> 00:00:47,606
â™«  Fate is full of twists and turns  â™«

8
00:00:47,606 --> 00:00:50,871
â™«  Life and death, fortune and misfortune go hand in hand  â™«

9
00:00:50,871 --> 00:00:55,807
â™«  Obsession is hard to get rid of, keeping the truth 
 and getting rid of the lies, let the wind blow  â™«

10
00:00:55,807 --> 00:01:02,279
â™«  Tossed about by the wind and rain, I will never regret it, 
 I will accompany you for my whole life  â™«

11
00:01:02,279 --> 00:01:08,587
â™«  At least you share my joy and sorrow  â™«

12
00:01:08,587 --> 00:01:14,766
â™«  Unravelling fate, fearlessly, a dream returns  â™«

13
00:01:14,766 --> 00:01:21,079
â™«  The mountains and rivers are bright and beautiful, 
 holding hands, together we return  â™«

14
00:01:21,079 --> 00:01:29,023
â™«  In this life, my heart returns untainted of dust and ash  â™«

15
00:01:29,023 --> 00:01:37,257
   

16
00:01:37,257 --> 00:01:40,320
   

17
00:01:41,440 --> 00:01:45,540
You can't offer me a worry-free home filled with warmth and understanding.

18
00:01:45,540 --> 00:01:47,820
Nor do you prioritize me.

19
00:01:47,820 --> 00:01:51,340
You're always trying to win and show off.

20
00:01:52,920 --> 00:01:56,300
You're not a good partner for me.

21
00:02:12,820 --> 00:02:14,760
What did you say?

22
00:02:22,120 --> 00:02:25,040
So this is what you think of me?

23
00:02:36,300 --> 00:02:39,340
Do you truly believe you are a good wife?

24
00:02:43,540 --> 00:02:48,060
Your mind is full of cases, and all you see are dossiers.

25
00:02:49,460 --> 00:02:55,200
Have you ever considered what kind of wife a man would want?

26
00:02:56,300 --> 00:02:58,680
You took your sister's place

27
00:02:58,680 --> 00:03:01,300
and married me as a spy, to begin with.

28
00:03:03,280 --> 00:03:06,080
Don't forget what we agreed on.

29
00:03:09,860 --> 00:03:12,600
The three-month period has passed.

30
00:03:12,600 --> 00:03:14,484
I, Shen Du,

31
00:03:15,760 --> 00:03:18,600
am determined to divorce you.

32
00:03:56,040 --> 00:03:58,160
In that case,

33
00:03:59,920 --> 00:04:02,680
let's divorce.

34
00:04:09,400 --> 00:04:12,240
From now on,

35
00:04:12,240 --> 00:04:15,640
we will go our separate ways.

36
00:04:15,640 --> 00:04:19,380
I will not have anything to do with you.

37
00:04:22,240 --> 00:04:26,300
Nor will I have anything to do with the honor or disgrace of your family.

38
00:04:29,459 --> 00:04:36,367
â™«  Heart burned, a withered body, a lifetime of solitude  â™«

39
00:04:36,367 --> 00:04:42,973
â™«  Passion burned, where it scattered, where it mottled  â™«

40
00:04:42,973 --> 00:04:51,460
â™«  Drifting in the mist, amidst the vast misty waves, groping in the dark  â™«

41
00:04:51,460 --> 00:04:56,732
â™«  You passing by, igniting fireworks  â™«

42
00:04:57,659 --> 00:05:04,655
â™«   To seek results, you fall into silence and become an Asura  â™«

43
00:05:04,655 --> 00:05:11,351
â™«  Love is complicated, it hurts you and burns me  â™«

44
00:05:11,351 --> 00:05:16,136
â™«  Flowers bloom and fall along the way, heavy rain pours  â™«

45
00:05:16,136 --> 00:05:19,663
â™«  The lights will intersect  â™«

46
00:05:19,663 --> 00:05:25,376
â™«  You are my whereabouts  â™«

47
00:05:25,376 --> 00:05:28,518
â™«  Who can save me from loneliness and confusion?  â™«

48
00:05:28,518 --> 00:05:32,423
â™«  Understand my vulnerability, no words are needed  â™«

49
00:05:32,423 --> 00:05:35,519
â™«  Who can save me from my confusion and persistence?  â™«

50
00:05:35,519 --> 00:05:39,580
â™«  Sheltering my loneliness, never allowing me to surrender  â™«

51
00:05:39,580 --> 00:05:43,913
â™«  I can't escape the shackles of our destiny  â™«

52
00:05:43,913 --> 00:05:47,493
â™«  Embracing the gentleness you've given  â™«

53
00:05:47,493 --> 00:05:53,404
â™«  Help me to see myself clearly, who I am  â™«

54
00:05:53,404 --> 00:05:56,721
â™«  Who can help me distinguish right from wrong?  â™«

55
00:05:56,721 --> 00:06:00,611
â™«  Through the sea of people, just hold me tight  â™«

56
00:06:00,611 --> 00:06:03,819
â™«  Who can save me from grudges and karma?  â™«

57
00:06:03,819 --> 00:06:07,806
â™«  Soothe my sense of loss, never to escape  â™«

58
00:06:07,806 --> 00:06:12,049
â™«  Impurities of the past have settled, we've met several times  â™«

59
00:06:12,049 --> 00:06:17,971
â™«  Who can break free from fate?  â™«

60
00:06:17,971 --> 00:06:24,240
â™«  Crossing rivers and plunging into fire for you  â™«

61
00:06:25,075 --> 00:06:31,368
â™«  Wishing to disappear in the hustle and bustle with you  â™«

62
00:06:43,160 --> 00:06:44,710
Sixth Daughter.

63
00:06:45,460 --> 00:06:47,320
Sixth Daughter!

64
00:06:48,520 --> 00:06:51,660
What's wrong? You look so pale.

65
00:06:53,280 --> 00:06:55,600
What happened?

66
00:06:55,600 --> 00:06:57,680
Mother.

67
00:07:00,140 --> 00:07:03,220
Sixth Daughter!

68
00:07:03,840 --> 00:07:07,180
Sixth Daughter. Sixth Daughter.

69
00:07:18,680 --> 00:07:20,644
 Shen Du. 

70
00:07:23,120 --> 00:07:24,800
 Shen Du! 

71
00:07:49,760 --> 00:07:51,860
 Shen Du. 

72
00:08:05,220 --> 00:08:07,148
Shen Du.

73
00:08:28,820 --> 00:08:31,280
Sixth Daughter, you woke up.

74
00:08:31,280 --> 00:08:34,920
You had a high fever. I was so worried.

75
00:08:36,892 --> 00:08:37,940
Where are you going?

76
00:08:37,940 --> 00:08:39,520
I'm going to find Shen Du.

77
00:08:39,520 --> 00:08:41,440
You're not allowed.

78
00:08:41,440 --> 00:08:44,280
Why would you still want to find that beast?

79
00:08:44,280 --> 00:08:46,860
You braved the snow to cry injustice for him.

80
00:08:46,860 --> 00:08:50,780
What about him? He was finally released but he didn't care about your condition.

81
00:08:50,780 --> 00:08:52,264
He evenâ€¦

82
00:08:53,680 --> 00:08:55,080
Even what?

83
00:08:55,080 --> 00:08:56,920
What's wrong with your voice?

84
00:08:56,920 --> 00:08:58,860
Even what?

85
00:09:01,200 --> 00:09:03,740
He even brought the divorce paper.

86
00:09:22,080 --> 00:09:24,080
Mother.

87
00:09:24,080 --> 00:09:26,160
Where is the divorce paper?

88
00:09:28,900 --> 00:09:31,900
Where is the divorce paper, Mother?

89
00:09:32,820 --> 00:09:34,640
Where is the divorce paper?

90
00:09:34,640 --> 00:09:38,600
Where is the divorce paper, Mother?

91
00:09:40,120 --> 00:09:43,940
Where is the divorce paper?

92
00:09:45,040 --> 00:09:48,240
Where is the divorce paper?

93
00:09:48,240 --> 00:09:51,640
Where is the divorce paper?

94
00:09:51,640 --> 00:09:53,860
Mother.

95
00:10:11,820 --> 00:10:13,600
I still don't believe it.

96
00:10:13,600 --> 00:10:17,100
Great Chief Shen seems so upright and unyielding.

97
00:10:17,100 --> 00:10:21,300
How could he submit to the Black Fiend?

98
00:10:21,300 --> 00:10:23,600
Shen Du has led the Imperial Guards

99
00:10:23,600 --> 00:10:27,920
to arrest many officials who didn't join Lai Luozhi.

100
00:10:27,920 --> 00:10:32,760
The Imperial Guards have been reduced to the hunting dogs of the Imperial Inspectorate.

101
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:35,860
He made such a choice.

102
00:10:35,860 --> 00:10:38,380
- Then our Yan familyâ€¦ 
 - Fifth Son.

103
00:10:39,120 --> 00:10:42,440
Since Shen Du has even sent us the divorce paper,

104
00:10:42,440 --> 00:10:45,000
then whatever he does from now on

105
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:48,820
has nothing to do with our Yan family.

106
00:10:48,820 --> 00:10:52,080
Under the current situation,

107
00:10:52,080 --> 00:10:55,780
divorce may protect you from the power struggle.

108
00:10:56,920 --> 00:10:59,980
But Sixth Miss is probably going to be heartbroken.

109
00:10:59,980 --> 00:11:01,908
   

110
00:11:05,780 --> 00:11:08,680
 That's not the only heartbreaking news. 

111
00:11:08,680 --> 00:11:12,560
She's been friends with the Marshal of Inspectors and Miss Yun Que.

112
00:11:12,560 --> 00:11:16,280
They were eliminated by the Imperial Inspectorate on the pretext of chaos

113
00:11:16,280 --> 00:11:18,940
 the night they pleaded for her in the palace. 

114
00:11:24,140 --> 00:11:26,440
Sixth Daughter.

115
00:11:26,440 --> 00:11:31,520
Brother Xu and Yun Que are dead?

116
00:11:37,470 --> 00:11:39,570
- Sixth Daughter! 
 - Sixth Daughter!

117
00:11:39,570 --> 00:11:43,300
You've just recovered from a fever; are you trying to kill yourself?

118
00:11:51,183 --> 00:11:54,000
   

119
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:55,480
Brother Xu.

120
00:11:55,480 --> 00:11:57,300
Yun Que.

121
00:11:57,300 --> 00:11:59,790
I had you killed.

122
00:12:00,360 --> 00:12:02,740
I owe you an apology.

123
00:12:19,340 --> 00:12:23,520
Even if it wasn't for you, they would have had to die anyway.

124
00:12:27,440 --> 00:12:29,300
Shen Du.

125
00:12:30,500 --> 00:12:33,980
Do not blame their deaths on yourself.

126
00:12:34,940 --> 00:12:37,100
You're not that important.

127
00:12:42,440 --> 00:12:46,500
Xu Xiangren wanted to find evidence of Vice Minister Lai's treason.

128
00:12:46,500 --> 00:12:49,100
So he had to die.

129
00:12:57,280 --> 00:13:00,200
Did you really ally with Lai Luozhi?

130
00:13:05,300 --> 00:13:10,660
You were released on the night when Brother Xu and Yun Que were killed.

131
00:13:14,840 --> 00:13:16,584
Did you reallyâ€¦

132
00:13:20,960 --> 00:13:24,840
Shen Du, what happened to you?

133
00:13:24,840 --> 00:13:27,020
Have you forgotten your aspirations?

134
00:13:27,020 --> 00:13:28,650
Have you forgotten your family's case

135
00:13:28,650 --> 00:13:32,580
and the dozens of your relatives who had died from injustice?

136
00:13:43,220 --> 00:13:45,228
I came today to advise you...

137
00:13:46,720 --> 00:13:50,140
not to cause unnecessary trouble.

138
00:13:50,880 --> 00:13:52,980
Think of the Yan family.

139
00:13:55,180 --> 00:13:57,560
Sign the divorce paper.

140
00:14:58,700 --> 00:15:00,900
   

141
00:15:12,730 --> 00:15:16,020
   

142
00:15:17,360 --> 00:15:21,920
Divorce me with your blood.

143
00:15:21,920 --> 00:15:27,520
For Brother Xu and Yun Que. For all those who died from injustice.

144
00:15:30,800 --> 00:15:32,680
Shen Du,

145
00:15:33,240 --> 00:15:37,820
from now on, you and I will be strangers.

146
00:16:00,260 --> 00:16:03,700
   

147
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:13,688
Sixth Miss!

148
00:17:16,030 --> 00:17:17,620
Sixth Miss.

149
00:17:18,550 --> 00:17:20,540
What happened?

150
00:17:26,620 --> 00:17:29,480
We went to the Yan Mansion. Lady Jin said you weren't home.

151
00:17:29,480 --> 00:17:32,220
So, Jiang Langxing and I came to look for you.

152
00:17:32,820 --> 00:17:36,220
You went to the graveyard?

153
00:17:37,660 --> 00:17:42,900
Brother Xu and Yun Que died because of me.

154
00:17:42,900 --> 00:17:47,260
Sixth Miss, don't say that.

155
00:17:47,260 --> 00:17:50,220
Lai Luozhi hated Marshal Xu...

156
00:17:50,980 --> 00:17:53,260
because he had saved me.

157
00:17:53,260 --> 00:17:55,480
Yet I left.

158
00:17:57,800 --> 00:18:02,560
Marshal Xu and Yun Que passed away in peace.

159
00:18:02,560 --> 00:18:04,112
I think...

160
00:18:05,900 --> 00:18:09,020
they must be happy in heaven.

161
00:18:16,780 --> 00:18:18,672
You're hurt.

162
00:18:23,940 --> 00:18:28,780
Shen Du has made up his mind to join forces with Lai Luozhi.

163
00:18:28,780 --> 00:18:31,880
The White Ghost has teamed up with Lai Luozhi?

164
00:18:47,900 --> 00:18:50,760
He is no longer the Shen Du I knew.

165
00:18:50,760 --> 00:18:55,540
From now on, I have nothing to do with him.

166
00:19:13,100 --> 00:19:14,850
Sixth Miss!

167
00:19:16,040 --> 00:19:17,868
Sixth Miss.

168
00:19:44,600 --> 00:19:48,510
   

169
00:20:16,779 --> 00:20:20,240
   

170
00:21:09,360 --> 00:21:14,880
Since you are worried about Sixth Daughter, why don't you talk to her?

171
00:21:17,760 --> 00:21:20,850
A mother knows her daughter.

172
00:21:21,440 --> 00:21:25,520
Sixth Daughter has been independent since she was young. It's a serious matter.

173
00:21:25,520 --> 00:21:31,320
If we rush there to comfort her, she will definitely put on a brave face

174
00:21:31,320 --> 00:21:35,040
and hide her emotions to prevent us from worrying.

175
00:21:37,160 --> 00:21:42,040
Indeed, Sixth Daughter never lets us worry about her.

176
00:21:44,340 --> 00:21:49,800
Women should never keep all the bitterness, anger, and sorrow to themselves.

177
00:21:49,800 --> 00:21:52,100
We may end up ill.

178
00:21:56,660 --> 00:21:59,600
Then let's leave her alone.

179
00:22:20,560 --> 00:22:23,660
 Make do over there for the night. 

180
00:22:27,980 --> 00:22:31,100
 If you want to stay, there's still half a bed inside. 

181
00:22:31,100 --> 00:22:33,200
 You can sleep on the inside. 

182
00:22:37,380 --> 00:22:41,949
â™«  Time is fleeting and fate is shallow  â™«

183
00:22:41,949 --> 00:22:47,673
â™«  The winter in warm memories  â™«

184
00:22:47,673 --> 00:22:51,708
â™«  Never mind the destined solitary fate  â™«

185
00:22:51,708 --> 00:22:56,082
â™«  Blazing a lifetime of magnificence  â™«

186
00:22:57,140 --> 00:23:01,960
 She became my wife as if it was destined. 

187
00:23:03,540 --> 00:23:06,060
 I want to tell her 

188
00:23:06,060 --> 00:23:12,140
 that I've always loved no one but her from the beginning. 

189
00:23:12,140 --> 00:23:17,140
â™«  He said he loves her  â™«

190
00:23:17,140 --> 00:23:21,140
 You can't offer me a worry-free home filled with warmth and understanding. 

191
00:23:21,140 --> 00:23:23,340
 Nor do you prioritize me. 

192
00:23:23,340 --> 00:23:26,400
 You're always trying to win and show off. 

193
00:23:26,400 --> 00:23:30,040
 You're not a good partner for me. 

194
00:23:30,040 --> 00:23:32,780
 The three-month period has passed. 

195
00:23:32,780 --> 00:23:37,120
 I, Shen Du, am determined to divorce you. 

196
00:23:37,880 --> 00:23:40,415
â™«  Love is pure and originally flawless  â™«

197
00:23:40,415 --> 00:23:43,232
â™«  Let the vast universe change  â™«

198
00:23:43,232 --> 00:23:48,092
â™«  Let's spend our time together  â™«

199
00:24:03,820 --> 00:24:06,420
- She hasn't eaten anything? 
 - Not a single bite.

200
00:24:06,420 --> 00:24:10,620
She wouldn't take the medicine, bandage the wound on the hand, or even open the door.

201
00:24:10,620 --> 00:24:13,200
What should we do?

202
00:24:14,060 --> 00:24:17,080
I've just gotten divorced myself. I've been doing so well.

203
00:24:17,080 --> 00:24:21,160
Life is much better than before. Maybe I can talk to Sixth Sister.

204
00:24:21,160 --> 00:24:22,560
Very good.

205
00:24:22,560 --> 00:24:24,720
 Father! 

206
00:24:24,720 --> 00:24:26,020
Father, something's wrong.

207
00:24:26,020 --> 00:24:29,340
I went to buy candied fruits for Sixth Sister and saw Imperial Inspectorate officers

208
00:24:29,340 --> 00:24:32,060
all around our mansion.

209
00:24:34,700 --> 00:24:37,760
Are you sure they're from the Imperial Inspectorate?

210
00:24:37,760 --> 00:24:42,740
I've been working for the Imperial Guards. I can recognize the scouts and spies.

211
00:24:42,740 --> 00:24:47,040
The Imperial Inspectorate is watching us.

212
00:24:47,920 --> 00:24:49,990
It's a man-made disaster.

213
00:24:50,920 --> 00:24:52,960
A man-made disaster.

214
00:24:52,960 --> 00:24:57,920
I've served the court for years, but I've never seen anything like this.

215
00:24:57,920 --> 00:25:00,230
Things are unpredictable in the court. Lai Luozhi is solely in charge.

216
00:25:00,230 --> 00:25:02,900
Things are unpredictable in the court. Lai Luozhi is solely in charge.

217
00:25:02,900 --> 00:25:06,940
Shen Du has just divorced Sixth Daughter, and he's sided with Lai Luozhi.

218
00:25:06,940 --> 00:25:09,700
- What does that mean? 
 - What does it mean?

219
00:25:10,460 --> 00:25:15,460
It means that we are in trouble.

220
00:25:15,460 --> 00:25:18,360
 Your Majesty, the start of spring is upon us. 

221
00:25:18,360 --> 00:25:22,200
We should start preparing for this year's grand assembly of all the officials.

222
00:25:22,200 --> 00:25:24,500
Here's the charter drafted by the Ministry of Personnel

223
00:25:24,500 --> 00:25:27,420
and the Ministry of Rites based on the precedents.

224
00:25:27,420 --> 00:25:31,080
Officials and military commanders will return to Xiang'an

225
00:25:31,080 --> 00:25:33,540
to pay tribute and report on their duties.

226
00:25:33,540 --> 00:25:36,400
However, since Your Majesty's ascension,

227
00:25:36,400 --> 00:25:40,960
the annual grand assembly has always been scheduled for the second day of the second month, the time for spring plowing.

228
00:25:40,960 --> 00:25:44,480
But this year, the Grand Empress Dowager is unwell.

229
00:25:44,480 --> 00:25:48,340
Should we reschedule the ceremony for a different date?

230
00:25:53,100 --> 00:25:58,520
The grand assembly is the annual event to settle court affairs, which involves officials

231
00:25:58,520 --> 00:26:02,420
from outside the capital, and commanders guarding the border.

232
00:26:02,420 --> 00:26:04,150
It should not be easily rescheduled.

233
00:26:04,150 --> 00:26:06,800
We shall proceed as usual on the second day of the second month.

234
00:26:06,800 --> 00:26:10,260
If the Grand Empress Dowager has not recovered by then,

235
00:26:10,260 --> 00:26:16,720
then I shall accompany His Majesty to preside over the grand assembly.

236
00:26:16,720 --> 00:26:22,460
Vice Minister Lai, do you really intend to stand in for the Grand Empress Dowager

237
00:26:22,460 --> 00:26:25,160
to preside over the grand assembly?

238
00:26:25,160 --> 00:26:26,840
Why not?

239
00:26:26,840 --> 00:26:32,660
Vice Minister Lai, the grand assembly is the annual gathering of all officials,

240
00:26:32,660 --> 00:26:36,320
which showcases the emperor's authority and the dignity of the royal family.

241
00:26:36,320 --> 00:26:38,530
The Grand Empress Dowager is regent behind the curtain

242
00:26:38,530 --> 00:26:42,020
to complete the duties on behalf of His Majesty.

243
00:26:42,020 --> 00:26:45,320
On what grounds will you preside over the assembly?

244
00:26:45,320 --> 00:26:47,600
The Grand Empress Dowager trusts me.

245
00:26:47,600 --> 00:26:50,920
She has entrusted me to oversee the works of all officials.

246
00:26:50,920 --> 00:26:56,920
I must therefore shoulder the responsibility of settling court affairs.

247
00:26:59,180 --> 00:27:03,720
I think Your Majesty would certainly welcome my company

248
00:27:03,720 --> 00:27:06,960
to preside over the grand assembly

249
00:27:06,960 --> 00:27:10,520
and receive officials and generals from all regions.

250
00:27:18,820 --> 00:27:21,480
His Majesty is inviting Vice Minister Lai.

251
00:27:21,480 --> 00:27:25,140
During the grand assembly, His Majesty clearly wishes for Vice Minister Lai

252
00:27:25,140 --> 00:27:27,660
to stand by his side.

253
00:27:27,660 --> 00:27:30,770
That's right. The Grand Empress Dowager allows Vice Minister Lai

254
00:27:30,770 --> 00:27:32,520
to oversee all officials.

255
00:27:32,520 --> 00:27:36,680
He is expected to preside over the grand assembly.

256
00:27:36,680 --> 00:27:41,420
Naturally, Vice Minister Lai is expected to preside over the grand assembly.

257
00:27:41,420 --> 00:27:45,340
You despicable beings! You're shameless enough to tell blatant lies.

258
00:27:45,340 --> 00:27:49,800
And you, Lai Luozhi, you aspire to overstep your bounds.

259
00:27:49,800 --> 00:27:54,040
Your intentions to steal the throne are blatantly obvious, and such intent deserves death!

260
00:27:54,780 --> 00:27:57,880
Great Chief Shen, you haven't said a word today.

261
00:27:57,880 --> 00:28:02,580
Why don't you tell me how the Imperial Guards should deal with someone

262
00:28:02,580 --> 00:28:05,480
who insults a high official in court

263
00:28:05,480 --> 00:28:07,820
based on your regulations?

264
00:28:07,820 --> 00:28:09,940
Those who insult high officials should be imprisoned and punished by water torture.

265
00:28:09,940 --> 00:28:15,200
Those who insult high officials should be imprisoned and punished by water torture.

266
00:28:15,200 --> 00:28:18,480
All right, let's proceed with that.

267
00:28:18,480 --> 00:28:20,360
Shen Du, youâ€¦

268
00:28:20,360 --> 00:28:25,320
Great Chief Shen, since when did you submit yourself to Lai Luozhi?

269
00:28:25,320 --> 00:28:27,240
Prime Minister Zhang.

270
00:28:28,120 --> 00:28:31,680
Princess of Valor. You both seem to have something against me.

271
00:28:31,680 --> 00:28:37,420
Are you scared that I will expose your despicable dealings?

272
00:28:37,420 --> 00:28:41,300
- What are you talking about? 
 - Princess of Valor and Prime Minister Zhang

273
00:28:41,300 --> 00:28:44,980
colluded with the rebels of Gannandao to plot treacherous schemes.

274
00:28:44,980 --> 00:28:48,900
Lai Luozhi, do not slander us!

275
00:28:48,900 --> 00:28:53,000
Lai Luozhi. Vice Minister Lai.

276
00:28:53,000 --> 00:28:56,240
You have always suppressed officials who oppose you.

277
00:28:56,240 --> 00:29:00,620
It's finally my turn today.

278
00:29:00,620 --> 00:29:02,620
But evidence matters the most.

279
00:29:02,620 --> 00:29:06,160
Do you think you can invert right and wrong in broad daylight?

280
00:29:06,160 --> 00:29:08,720
Evidence? Of course, there is evidence.

281
00:29:08,720 --> 00:29:14,040
I've obtained the brochure handed in by the convict Mo Qianzhi from the Imperial Guards.

282
00:29:14,040 --> 00:29:18,330
It keeps a clear record of everything, allowing no room for your rebuttal.

283
00:29:18,330 --> 00:29:20,520
Youâ€¦

284
00:29:20,520 --> 00:29:23,880
Am I right, Great Chief Shen?

285
00:29:23,880 --> 00:29:26,480
Based on Mo Qianzhi's testimony,

286
00:29:26,480 --> 00:29:28,820
the Princess of Valor colluded with the stationed troops of Gannandao.

287
00:29:28,820 --> 00:29:32,180
Prime Minister Zhang let his subordinates embezzle the funds of Gannandao.

288
00:29:32,180 --> 00:29:36,980
They should be put under house arrest for a thorough investigation.

289
00:29:36,980 --> 00:29:41,240
I am a royalty. How dare you confine me?

290
00:29:41,240 --> 00:29:43,900
Where are the Imperial Personal Guards?

291
00:29:54,160 --> 00:29:56,500
Imperial Personal Guards!

292
00:29:57,500 --> 00:30:00,120
Princess of Valor.

293
00:30:01,340 --> 00:30:04,580
Can't you tell?

294
00:30:05,420 --> 00:30:08,480
Half of the people in the court of Great Cang

295
00:30:08,480 --> 00:30:12,040
have pledged loyalty to Lai Luozhi.

296
00:30:17,780 --> 00:30:20,060
Given your status,

297
00:30:20,060 --> 00:30:23,640
you two should walk out to keep some dignity.

298
00:30:23,640 --> 00:30:29,040
Do I have to call the Imperial Guards and the Imperial Inspectorate Officers to arrest you two?

299
00:30:29,940 --> 00:30:31,770
Shen Du, you traitor!

300
00:30:31,770 --> 00:30:34,340
You actually colluded with the Black Fiend.

301
00:30:34,340 --> 00:30:37,960
All of you treacherous scoundrels who invert right and wrong.

302
00:30:37,960 --> 00:30:42,340
 You shall perish! You shall perish! 

303
00:30:49,440 --> 00:30:51,200
Who would have thought?

304
00:30:51,200 --> 00:30:53,630
I wear my heart on my sleeve

305
00:30:53,630 --> 00:30:57,220
to repay the kindness of His Majesty and the Grand Empress Dowager.

306
00:30:57,220 --> 00:31:00,520
Yet I'm slandered by these ignorant people.

307
00:31:00,520 --> 00:31:03,360
Now that I shoulder heavy responsibilities,

308
00:31:03,360 --> 00:31:07,920
I can only do my utmost to fulfill the task

309
00:31:07,920 --> 00:31:10,760
regardless of what others say about me.

310
00:31:11,480 --> 00:31:15,380
Am I right, Great Chief Shen?

311
00:31:22,120 --> 00:31:24,560
Well.

312
00:31:24,560 --> 00:31:29,800
Shall we proceed with the grand assembly as discussed?

313
00:31:43,760 --> 00:31:45,420
What are you doing?

314
00:31:45,420 --> 00:31:48,860
How dare you come here as a mere nobody from a humble background?

315
00:31:48,860 --> 00:31:51,300
You've tarnished the reputation of our Hongwen School.

316
00:31:51,300 --> 00:31:53,880
We must make things right.

317
00:31:53,880 --> 00:31:58,460
I earned my place here through the examination.

318
00:31:58,460 --> 00:32:00,370
Knowledge does not distinguish between noble and humble.

319
00:32:00,370 --> 00:32:02,760
Why do you treat the humble families with such contempt?

320
00:32:02,760 --> 00:32:05,860
You're just a dog we let in by opening the door.

321
00:32:05,860 --> 00:32:09,220
Do you truly think you can stand on equal footing with us noble families?

322
00:32:09,220 --> 00:32:15,440
Remember. A dog is a dog even if it enters a house.

323
00:32:18,240 --> 00:32:21,180
Vice Minister Lai isn't from the noble classes.

324
00:32:21,180 --> 00:32:24,360
But you people from the noble classes are always so eager to fawn and flatter,

325
00:32:24,360 --> 00:32:28,100
willing to be dogs for Vice Minister Lai.

326
00:32:28,100 --> 00:32:29,820
How dare you?

327
00:32:29,820 --> 00:32:31,800
Beat him up!

328
00:32:39,000 --> 00:32:40,680
Stop!

329
00:32:47,220 --> 00:32:50,030
Imperial Guard Jing, those students from noble classes

330
00:32:50,030 --> 00:32:52,020
are bullying the ones from humble backgrounds.

331
00:32:52,020 --> 00:32:55,290
Hongwen School is the top academic institution in Great Cang,

332
00:32:55,290 --> 00:32:57,860
where His Majesty gets educated.

333
00:32:57,860 --> 00:33:02,380
You don't focus on your studies and pick fights instead. What a disgrace!

334
00:33:02,380 --> 00:33:03,620
Iâ€¦

335
00:33:03,620 --> 00:33:05,120
It's them.

336
00:33:05,120 --> 00:33:06,760
Yeah, it's him.

337
00:33:06,760 --> 00:33:09,920
He's the one stirring up trouble and distracting us from our studies.

338
00:33:09,920 --> 00:33:11,560
 Yes, it's him! 

339
00:33:11,560 --> 00:33:13,800
It's him causing trouble.

340
00:33:14,640 --> 00:33:17,940
Imperial Guard Jing, that's not it, It's them.

341
00:33:20,400 --> 00:33:23,460
Since you've been bothering your schoolmates,

342
00:33:23,460 --> 00:33:27,080
reflect on yourself in our prison.

343
00:33:30,640 --> 00:33:34,660
How did you Imperial Guards end up like this?

344
00:33:34,660 --> 00:33:37,160
Are you really siding with the treacherous?

345
00:33:37,160 --> 00:33:40,180
Great Chief Shen escorted us here for the exam.

346
00:33:40,180 --> 00:33:44,360
He said Hongwen School recruited talents without regard for social class.

347
00:33:44,360 --> 00:33:47,780
Now, are you going to tell me that we,

348
00:33:47,780 --> 00:33:51,690
the humble students from poor families, who have worked hard to study,

349
00:33:51,690 --> 00:33:54,940
are actually in the wrong?

350
00:34:01,080 --> 00:34:04,240
You can't judge the situation and act accordingly.

351
00:34:04,240 --> 00:34:06,180
Yes, you're wrong.

352
00:34:06,180 --> 00:34:07,880
Take him away.

353
00:34:08,600 --> 00:34:10,760
- How dare he stand against us? 
 - Really!

354
00:34:10,760 --> 00:34:12,800
He deserves it.

355
00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:20,340
Step aside.

356
00:34:20,340 --> 00:34:22,272
Step aside.

357
00:34:29,000 --> 00:34:32,420
People call you the White Ghost and me the Black Fiend.

358
00:34:32,420 --> 00:34:37,079
Now we're strolling on the street side by side.

359
00:34:37,079 --> 00:34:40,150
It feels quite special.

360
00:34:40,940 --> 00:34:42,700
The street is so spacious.

361
00:34:42,700 --> 00:34:45,400
Can't you people walk properly?

362
00:34:45,400 --> 00:34:48,499
Do you have to dash about and bully the people?

363
00:34:48,499 --> 00:34:53,859
How did you inspectors let someone block the Vice Minister's way?

364
00:34:57,640 --> 00:35:03,880
Our duty as inspectors is to guard the capital and the safety of the people,

365
00:35:03,880 --> 00:35:06,400
not to clear the streets as someone's slaves.

366
00:35:06,400 --> 00:35:08,500
What an eyesore.

367
00:35:09,720 --> 00:35:13,780
Great Chief Shen, the Imperial Guards are in charge of the security of the capital area.

368
00:35:13,780 --> 00:35:20,220
We don't need these petty thieves to be an eyesore in the city, do we?

369
00:35:20,220 --> 00:35:22,120
You're right.

370
00:35:22,120 --> 00:35:26,220
Shen Du, you uphold no morality and assist a tyrant in his oppression.

371
00:35:26,220 --> 00:35:28,360
Can you justify yourself to the deceased Marshal Xu and Yun Que?

372
00:35:28,360 --> 00:35:30,640
Can you justify yourself to Yan Xing?

373
00:35:35,040 --> 00:35:37,260
How dare you minor inspector

374
00:35:37,260 --> 00:35:39,760
challenge the Great Chief of the Imperial Guards?

375
00:35:39,760 --> 00:35:44,440
It seems you've never had a taste of the Imperial Inspectorate's urn punishment.

376
00:35:44,440 --> 00:35:47,420
- Guards. 
 - Wait.

377
00:35:49,080 --> 00:35:54,560
Since he insulted me, then I shall handle this by myself.

378
00:36:18,720 --> 00:36:23,910
I spared your life today so you may go back and discipline your buddies.

379
00:36:23,910 --> 00:36:27,400
Tell your friends that those memories

380
00:36:27,400 --> 00:36:29,960
in the past no longer hold any value to me.

381
00:36:29,960 --> 00:36:32,240
If you dare to speak disrespectfully again,

382
00:36:32,240 --> 00:36:36,400
I will make you wish you were dead.

383
00:36:45,428 --> 00:36:46,760
   

384
00:36:46,760 --> 00:36:52,320
Chuichui, Jiang Langxing was humiliated by the White Ghost on the street.

385
00:36:52,320 --> 00:36:53,980
What?

386
00:36:53,980 --> 00:36:56,780
Shen Du humiliated Jiang Langxing on the street?

387
00:36:56,780 --> 00:36:59,900
Yes, this is what I've heard.

388
00:36:59,900 --> 00:37:04,300
It was because he and the inspectors offended Vice Minister Lai.

389
00:37:04,900 --> 00:37:09,280
Shen Du sided with Lai Luozhi?

390
00:37:10,480 --> 00:37:14,660
The Black Fiend joined hands with the White Ghost.

391
00:37:14,660 --> 00:37:16,240
All right, Shen Du.

392
00:37:16,240 --> 00:37:19,580
I'd like to see if he's lost his conscience.

393
00:37:19,580 --> 00:37:21,680
 Where is the Director of the Ministry of Justice? 

394
00:37:21,680 --> 00:37:24,480
- Let me go! 
 - Hurry up!

395
00:37:31,080 --> 00:37:32,864
Behave.

396
00:37:37,920 --> 00:37:40,260
Vice Minister Lai, what brought you to the Ministry of Justice?

397
00:37:40,260 --> 00:37:42,120
Vice Minister Lai.

398
00:37:45,740 --> 00:37:47,364
Stickler.

399
00:37:48,840 --> 00:37:50,720
I'm fine.

400
00:37:50,720 --> 00:37:52,800
I received a report that

401
00:37:52,800 --> 00:37:56,240
the case records are incomplete and full of loopholes.

402
00:37:56,240 --> 00:37:58,880
I wonder who is responsible for this.

403
00:37:58,880 --> 00:38:00,920
Wellâ€¦

404
00:38:08,160 --> 00:38:10,980
So Registrar Lu is responsible for that.

405
00:38:10,980 --> 00:38:14,120
This is like biting the hand that feeds you, isn't it?

406
00:38:15,800 --> 00:38:19,080
Who dared to denounce the Ministry of Justice?

407
00:38:20,880 --> 00:38:25,860
Don't they know that Registrar Lu is mine?

408
00:38:28,120 --> 00:38:30,980
- Drag him out! 
 - Understood!

409
00:38:30,980 --> 00:38:34,040
If anyone dares to bother Registrar Lu again,

410
00:38:34,040 --> 00:38:37,100
I'll take it personally.

411
00:38:38,700 --> 00:38:42,880
Don't worry, Chuichui.

412
00:38:42,880 --> 00:38:46,820
No matter where you go, you are always mine.

413
00:38:46,820 --> 00:38:48,616
In your dreams!

414
00:38:50,000 --> 00:38:51,644
Really?

415
00:39:09,520 --> 00:39:11,660
Lai Luozhi.

416
00:39:11,660 --> 00:39:14,080
You despicable man! Let me go!

417
00:39:14,080 --> 00:39:16,360
I dare you to fight me to the death.

418
00:39:16,360 --> 00:39:18,560
I can crush you like an ant.

419
00:39:18,560 --> 00:39:21,240
Who are you to negotiate terms with me?

420
00:39:21,240 --> 00:39:24,420
What do you want, Lai Luozhi?

421
00:39:26,080 --> 00:39:27,900
What's wrong?

422
00:39:28,500 --> 00:39:30,600
You feel for him?

423
00:39:33,180 --> 00:39:37,300
You're shedding tears for an ant.

424
00:39:37,300 --> 00:39:39,920
It's so not worth it.

425
00:39:42,360 --> 00:39:46,900
Actually, I can't bear to make things hard for you.

426
00:39:46,900 --> 00:39:49,460
But last night, I had trouble sleeping...

427
00:39:50,360 --> 00:39:55,440
and recalled the folksong you once sang.

428
00:39:58,600 --> 00:40:01,360
How about you sing it for me again?

429
00:40:01,360 --> 00:40:05,640
If my mood gets better, maybe I'll be willing...

430
00:40:07,400 --> 00:40:09,860
to show some mercy.

431
00:40:09,860 --> 00:40:12,640
Chuichui, don't listen to him.

432
00:40:12,640 --> 00:40:15,300
- Don't sing. 
 - Shut up!

433
00:40:15,300 --> 00:40:17,020
Don't sing!

434
00:40:24,240 --> 00:40:29,360
â™ª  Mind your words  â™ª

435
00:40:31,320 --> 00:40:36,280
â™ª  Grandma displeased  â™ª

436
00:40:38,400 --> 00:40:49,120
â™ª  Mother keeps picking flowers  â™ª

437
00:40:50,720 --> 00:40:54,680
â™ª  Mind your words  â™ª

438
00:40:54,680 --> 00:40:57,020
 Be a good boy, Zhi. 

439
00:40:59,800 --> 00:41:02,740
â™ª  Mind your words  â™ª

440
00:41:02,740 --> 00:41:05,320
â™ª  Grandma displeased  â™ª

441
00:41:05,320 --> 00:41:09,020
â™ª  Mother keeps picking flowers  â™ª

442
00:41:09,020 --> 00:41:11,200
â™ª  Grandma displeased  â™ª

443
00:41:11,200 --> 00:41:13,720
â™ª  Grandma displeased  â™ª

444
00:41:25,960 --> 00:41:28,320
As I said,

445
00:41:28,320 --> 00:41:34,060
you can get whatever you want as long as you don't leave me.

446
00:41:34,060 --> 00:41:36,800
As for those people you care about,

447
00:41:36,800 --> 00:41:42,280
I won't give them too much of a hard time for your sake.
