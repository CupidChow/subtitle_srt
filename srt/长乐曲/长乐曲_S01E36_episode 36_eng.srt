00:00:27,560 --> 00:00:32,020
 "Go Ahead Fearlessly" - Liu Yuning 

3
00:00:32,022 --> 00:00:34,960
â™«  Grudges and karma, right and wrong  â™«

4
00:00:34,960 --> 00:00:38,258
â™«  The past hides blood and tears  â™«

5
00:00:38,258 --> 00:00:40,627
â™«  It is hard to catch up after years of separation  â™«

6
00:00:40,627 --> 00:00:44,502
â™«  The truth cannot be fully revealed  â™«

7
00:00:44,502 --> 00:00:47,637
â™«  Fate is full of twists and turns  â™«

8
00:00:47,637 --> 00:00:50,802
â™«  Life and death, fortune and misfortune go hand in hand  â™«

9
00:00:50,802 --> 00:00:55,838
â™«  Obsession is hard to get rid of, keeping the truth 
 and getting rid of the lies, let the wind blow  â™«

10
00:00:55,838 --> 00:01:02,210
â™«  Tossed about by the wind and rain, I will never regret it, 
 I will accompany you for my whole life  â™«

11
00:01:02,210 --> 00:01:08,618
â™«  At least you share my joy and sorrow  â™«

12
00:01:08,618 --> 00:01:14,797
â™«  Unravelling fate, fearlessly, a dream returns  â™«

13
00:01:14,797 --> 00:01:21,110
â™«  The mountains and rivers are bright and beautiful, 
 holding hands, together we return  â™«

14
00:01:21,110 --> 00:01:28,954
â™«  In this life, my heart returns untainted of dust and ash  â™«

15
00:01:28,954 --> 00:01:37,188
   

16
00:01:37,188 --> 00:01:40,223
   

17
00:01:44,900 --> 00:01:48,240
Lord Geng, that lawless scoundrel Lai is becoming bolder by the day.

18
00:01:48,240 --> 00:01:51,360
We need to think of a countermeasure.

19
00:01:52,620 --> 00:01:54,440
Lord Geng.

20
00:02:07,120 --> 00:02:08,730
Those who steal hooks are punished,

21
00:02:08,730 --> 00:02:11,930
while those who steal nations are lords. 
  (This phrase is used to satirize the hypocrisy and irrationality of the law.) 

22
00:03:18,140 --> 00:03:19,988
Huan.

23
00:03:21,840 --> 00:03:25,860
Do you hate me?

24
00:03:26,640 --> 00:03:30,680
So you torment me every night in my dream.

25
00:03:31,980 --> 00:03:39,460
Do you also think like those old ministers that...

26
00:03:40,340 --> 00:03:44,780
I'm greedy for power?

27
00:03:56,380 --> 00:03:58,900
Huan,

28
00:03:58,900 --> 00:04:05,120
Qi'er cannot speak well.

29
00:04:05,120 --> 00:04:09,760
And Xichen and Nanlang are aiming at us.

30
00:04:09,760 --> 00:04:15,120
I'm holding up Great Cang all by myself.

31
00:04:15,120 --> 00:04:19,820
I don't owe you anything.

32
00:04:28,900 --> 00:04:30,900
Grand Empress Dowager.

33
00:04:31,620 --> 00:04:36,180
Now the court is unstable, you should take more care of your health.

34
00:04:37,920 --> 00:04:40,148
I'm fine.

35
00:04:42,100 --> 00:04:46,480
The Imperial Preceptor has passed away,

36
00:04:47,360 --> 00:04:50,320
and we face both domestic strife and foreign aggression.

37
00:04:50,320 --> 00:04:53,920
So I feel troubled.

38
00:04:57,760 --> 00:05:01,720
Have you properly arranged the imperial court's affairs?

39
00:05:01,720 --> 00:05:03,300
As you requested,

40
00:05:03,300 --> 00:05:05,780
I have trusted Vice Minister Lai to assist with the imperial court's affairs.

41
00:05:05,780 --> 00:05:07,240
Vice Minister Lai has said,

42
00:05:07,240 --> 00:05:10,500
he hopes you don't worry about imperial court affairs and get a good rest.

43
00:05:10,500 --> 00:05:12,200
All right.

44
00:05:12,200 --> 00:05:17,440
I still remember the Imperial Preceptor had worked hard for the country.

45
00:05:17,440 --> 00:05:19,750
Before he died,

46
00:05:19,750 --> 00:05:23,900
he tried his best to prophesy for the Great Cang.

47
00:05:28,900 --> 00:05:31,076
I wishâ€¦

48
00:05:33,100 --> 00:05:37,180
I wish Great Cang could be...

49
00:05:38,380 --> 00:05:42,340
as peaceful

50
00:05:42,340 --> 00:05:45,420
as the Imperial Preceptor prophesied.

51
00:06:05,432 --> 00:06:08,440
   

52
00:06:08,440 --> 00:06:10,450
Quickly go! Quickly go!

53
00:06:11,160 --> 00:06:14,280
- Qi Yeyun! Qi Yeyun! Come out now. 
  - I'm coming. 

54
00:06:14,280 --> 00:06:17,040
- What's wrong? Why close the shop in broad daylight? 
 - Close the shop now.

55
00:06:17,040 --> 00:06:19,720
You're cooped up at home all day. Aren't you curious about anything outside?

56
00:06:19,720 --> 00:06:21,560
Great calamity has befallen.

57
00:06:21,560 --> 00:06:23,260
The Grand Empress Dowager is seriously ill.

58
00:06:23,260 --> 00:06:26,440
Now the Black Fiend is in power, everything is about to change.

59
00:06:26,440 --> 00:06:30,620
It is said that several loyal ministers who opposed Lai Luozhi have been assassinated.

60
00:06:30,620 --> 00:06:33,500
In such times, why would we even keep our shop open?

61
00:06:33,500 --> 00:06:34,730
The country is in turmoil.

62
00:06:34,730 --> 00:06:36,840
This is a business opportunity for our pawnshop.

63
00:06:36,840 --> 00:06:39,040
How foolish! Let me ask you.

64
00:06:39,040 --> 00:06:41,420
Which one is more important, money or life?

65
00:06:41,420 --> 00:06:44,000
Close the shop now!

66
00:07:12,820 --> 00:07:18,300
Vice Minister Lai, what brings you here to the Imperial Guards?

67
00:07:18,300 --> 00:07:20,840
Now, the Jin clan has been detained by the Imperial Guards.

68
00:07:20,840 --> 00:07:23,280
Yet you haven't proceeded with the trial.

69
00:07:23,280 --> 00:07:26,580
Great Chief Shen, do you think that the Grand Empress Dowager is seriously ill,

70
00:07:26,580 --> 00:07:30,440
then you can be negligent in your duty?

71
00:07:30,440 --> 00:07:33,320
We still need more evidence.

72
00:07:34,240 --> 00:07:38,400
Evidence? What I brought with me today is the evidence.

73
00:07:38,400 --> 00:07:43,300
Great Chief Shen, please proceed with the trial and judgment immediately.

74
00:07:52,040 --> 00:07:56,200
How can I make a judgment based solely on your words?

75
00:07:56,200 --> 00:08:00,900
If you don't, fine then. I'll do it.

76
00:08:00,900 --> 00:08:02,620
Lai Luozhi,

77
00:08:02,620 --> 00:08:05,460
are you openly showing contempt for the authority of the court?

78
00:08:05,460 --> 00:08:10,700
You still have no right to intervene in the affairs of the Imperial Guards.

79
00:08:12,140 --> 00:08:16,060
The Imperial Inspectorate cannot, but I, Lai Luozhi, can do it.

80
00:08:16,060 --> 00:08:17,160
Do not forget that.

81
00:08:17,160 --> 00:08:21,760
The Grand Empress Dowager has granted me the right to reward and punish officials at my discretion.

82
00:08:22,640 --> 00:08:23,900
Palace Guards, await my command!

83
00:08:23,900 --> 00:08:29,480
Shen Du of the Imperial Guards is negligent in his duty while the Grand Empress Dowager is ill.

84
00:08:29,480 --> 00:08:32,140
He is hereby detained and awaits trial.

85
00:08:39,380 --> 00:08:43,360
What? How dare you to go against the imperial palace guards!

86
00:08:43,360 --> 00:08:46,960
Great Chief, are you planning a rebellion?

87
00:08:58,400 --> 00:09:02,240
If you kill the commander of the imperial palace guards,

88
00:09:02,240 --> 00:09:07,340
you and everyone in the Imperial Guards will be charged with the crime of treason today.

89
00:09:07,340 --> 00:09:09,500
Who dares!

90
00:09:22,820 --> 00:09:24,730
Lai Luozhi,

91
00:09:25,620 --> 00:09:29,340
I can't believe you brought the Iron Crossbow Troop of the imperial palace guards.

92
00:09:31,620 --> 00:09:35,780
The imperial palace guards are cleverer than you guys are.

93
00:09:36,860 --> 00:09:40,090
Those in the Imperial Guards who refuse to be caught,

94
00:09:40,090 --> 00:09:42,720
will be executed on the spot.

95
00:10:03,600 --> 00:10:06,260
Put down your swords.

96
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:11,996
Please.

97
00:10:12,800 --> 00:10:14,980
Great Chief Shen.

98
00:10:58,520 --> 00:11:00,900
Sir! Sir, Sir!

99
00:11:00,900 --> 00:11:02,960
Terrible things have happened.

100
00:11:02,960 --> 00:11:05,960
Vice Minister Lai is leading the imperial palace guards to surround the Imperial Guards.

101
00:11:06,760 --> 00:11:09,040
Great Chief Shen and everyone in the Imperial Guards

102
00:11:09,040 --> 00:11:11,040
have been thrown into the Imperial Inspectorate's prison.

103
00:11:11,040 --> 00:11:13,560
Lai Luozhi has really laid a hand on Great Chief Shen?

104
00:11:13,560 --> 00:11:16,660
It's true. The Imperial Guards and the Imperial Inspectorate have always been foes.

105
00:11:16,660 --> 00:11:18,520
According to Vice Minister Lai's style,

106
00:11:18,520 --> 00:11:20,640
he might exterminate everyone in the Imperial Guards,

107
00:11:20,640 --> 00:11:23,560
along with their nine clans.

108
00:11:28,040 --> 00:11:29,800
Guards.

109
00:11:29,800 --> 00:11:31,880
Wu Taiming, what do you want to do?

110
00:11:31,880 --> 00:11:34,260
Are you going to hand over Sixth Miss?

111
00:11:35,320 --> 00:11:36,640
Seize the weapons.

112
00:11:36,640 --> 00:11:38,416
Yes.

113
00:11:43,320 --> 00:11:45,036
Feng Gui.

114
00:11:47,680 --> 00:11:52,220
Get me the appointment document from the Grand Empress Dowager for Director Yan and me.

115
00:11:55,680 --> 00:11:58,980
If that Lai guy dares to come, I'll tell him...

116
00:11:58,980 --> 00:12:02,360
that Yan Xing is not only the wife of the Great Chief of the Imperial Guards,

117
00:12:02,360 --> 00:12:06,070
but also the female official of the Ministry of Justice, holding a sixth-rank position,

118
00:12:06,070 --> 00:12:08,500
specially appointed by the Grand Empress Dowager.

119
00:12:09,640 --> 00:12:10,880
Follow me.

120
00:12:10,880 --> 00:12:13,980
Block the main gate of the Ministry of Justice.

121
00:12:13,980 --> 00:12:17,850
   

122
00:12:33,280 --> 00:12:35,560
Sir, it's been a long while,

123
00:12:35,560 --> 00:12:37,240
and those from the Imperial Inspectorate haven't come yet.

124
00:12:37,240 --> 00:12:39,620
I've told you. We can't take it lightly.

125
00:12:39,620 --> 00:12:41,960
We can't take it lightly.

126
00:12:43,400 --> 00:12:44,840
Keep guarding.

127
00:12:44,840 --> 00:12:46,740
He didn't come either. Isn't this...

128
00:12:46,740 --> 00:12:48,692
Keep guarding.

129
00:12:57,300 --> 00:12:58,720
Who is it?

130
00:12:58,720 --> 00:12:59,880
 Madam. 

131
00:12:59,880 --> 00:13:01,800
Sixth Sister!

132
00:13:01,800 --> 00:13:04,100
 - I'm your brother, Sixth Sister!  
 - Fifth Brother?

133
00:13:04,100 --> 00:13:05,120
 -Madam! 

134
00:13:05,120 --> 00:13:07,300
 - Sixth Sister!  
 - Uncle Zhong.

135
00:13:07,300 --> 00:13:09,208
Open the gate.

136
00:13:14,090 --> 00:13:16,270
   

137
00:13:16,276 --> 00:13:18,060
- Fifth Brother. 
 - Madam.

138
00:13:18,060 --> 00:13:19,020
Uncle Zhong.

139
00:13:19,020 --> 00:13:20,800
Father told me to bring you back to the Yan Mansion.

140
00:13:20,800 --> 00:13:23,180
We will protect you.

141
00:13:25,640 --> 00:13:29,320
Fifth Brother, thank you all!

142
00:13:29,320 --> 00:13:33,860
Uncle Zhong, today I'll still go back to the Shen Mansion.

143
00:13:33,860 --> 00:13:35,820
Madam!

144
00:13:47,160 --> 00:13:49,112
Please.

145
00:14:03,560 --> 00:14:07,740
I, Yan Xing, thank you all, my colleagues.

146
00:14:24,840 --> 00:14:26,896
Please, Madam.

147
00:14:52,720 --> 00:14:56,840
Is this still the awe-inspiring Great Chief Shen?

148
00:15:03,600 --> 00:15:06,100
I dare not recognize you.

149
00:15:15,080 --> 00:15:17,144
Shen Du.

150
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:24,220
You really aren't smart.

151
00:15:25,760 --> 00:15:29,440
What a tough guy you are!

152
00:15:30,160 --> 00:15:34,260
Here in the Imperial Inspectorate, I've seen so many tough guys.

153
00:15:34,260 --> 00:15:38,840
After a few times of torture, those who don't want to talk,

154
00:15:38,840 --> 00:15:41,680
can only ask for death.

155
00:15:44,600 --> 00:15:48,460
But you could still stare at me.

156
00:15:48,460 --> 00:15:54,420
Indeed. You really deserve to be my long-time rival.

157
00:15:57,680 --> 00:16:00,360
The Imperial Inspectorate's torture instruments...

158
00:16:00,360 --> 00:16:02,680
truly live up to their reputation.

159
00:16:03,480 --> 00:16:05,680
I, Shen Du, in my lifetime,

160
00:16:06,640 --> 00:16:09,320
have certainly experienced it all.

161
00:16:09,320 --> 00:16:11,840
Youâ€™re so capable.

162
00:16:11,840 --> 00:16:16,480
If you actually died, wouldn't that be a pity?

163
00:16:23,840 --> 00:16:28,060
They call you the White Ghost and me the Black Fiend.

164
00:16:28,060 --> 00:16:34,280
If you and I can get along well and work together, then...

165
00:16:35,840 --> 00:16:38,200
no one can beat us in this world.

166
00:16:38,200 --> 00:16:41,440
It's a shame for me

167
00:16:41,440 --> 00:16:44,640
to be compared

168
00:16:44,640 --> 00:16:47,880
to someone like you.

169
00:16:52,080 --> 00:16:54,560
You rejected me.

170
00:16:55,560 --> 00:17:01,580
Everyone says that the two of us are the left and right arms of the Grand Empress Dowager.

171
00:17:01,580 --> 00:17:03,480
But do you know it?

172
00:17:03,480 --> 00:17:06,960
She has long suspected that you and I have ulterior motives,

173
00:17:06,960 --> 00:17:10,600
making us monitor each other and go against each other.

174
00:17:10,600 --> 00:17:14,660
And she... can sit back and enjoy the benefits.

175
00:17:16,119 --> 00:17:21,880
After all, she is the most formidable woman in this world.

176
00:17:23,940 --> 00:17:27,240
The world is all in her grasp.

177
00:17:28,480 --> 00:17:30,424
Including you,

178
00:17:31,480 --> 00:17:33,432
me,

179
00:17:34,360 --> 00:17:36,980
and the Shen family...

180
00:17:38,480 --> 00:17:40,540
back then.

181
00:17:46,280 --> 00:17:48,940
Has anyone told you...

182
00:17:49,640 --> 00:17:55,800
that the Shen family was framed by the Grand Empress Dowager herself?

183
00:18:03,280 --> 00:18:05,200
And youâ€¦

184
00:18:05,200 --> 00:18:07,120
You fool!

185
00:18:07,120 --> 00:18:13,320
Yet you have served your enemy for so many years.

186
00:18:16,960 --> 00:18:19,000
Where is the evidence?

187
00:18:19,640 --> 00:18:21,580
Evidence?

188
00:18:23,480 --> 00:18:26,280
Don't lie to yourself.

189
00:18:26,280 --> 00:18:31,140
Over these years, you should have realized...

190
00:18:31,760 --> 00:18:35,420
in the case of Shen Bingzhu collaborating with the enemy,

191
00:18:35,420 --> 00:18:38,980
there was more than one person wanting him dead.

192
00:18:38,980 --> 00:18:40,932
Why?

193
00:18:42,480 --> 00:18:47,760
Because everyone knew it was the Grand Empress Dowager who wanted him dead.

194
00:18:51,460 --> 00:18:56,520
Dozens of people, not a single one left.

195
00:18:57,280 --> 00:19:00,260
Except you, a fool.

196
00:19:12,440 --> 00:19:14,200
You're talking nonsense.

197
00:19:14,200 --> 00:19:16,300
You're talking nonsense.

198
00:19:16,880 --> 00:19:19,400
You're talking nonsense!

199
00:19:42,600 --> 00:19:44,480
Yes.

200
00:19:44,480 --> 00:19:46,080
You've seen it.

201
00:19:46,080 --> 00:19:47,600
The fire moth is me.

202
00:19:47,600 --> 00:19:51,100
I am the true leader of the Huo'e Sect.

203
00:19:51,100 --> 00:19:53,320
Shen Du,

204
00:19:53,320 --> 00:19:56,420
you've witnessed the power of the Huo'e Sect.

205
00:19:56,420 --> 00:20:01,000
Why not conspire with me on a grand plan?

206
00:21:00,263 --> 00:21:04,315
   

207
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:44,080
- Madam. 
 - Madam.

208
00:21:48,040 --> 00:21:49,760
Madam,

209
00:21:49,760 --> 00:21:55,100
Xiang'an City is now already under Lai Luozhi's control.

210
00:21:55,100 --> 00:21:58,420
So many officials who opposed him have been assassinated.

211
00:21:58,420 --> 00:22:03,060
On your way there, you must be very careful.

212
00:22:03,060 --> 00:22:05,200
Butler Shen,

213
00:22:05,200 --> 00:22:09,460
no matter how hard it is to get there today,

214
00:22:09,460 --> 00:22:12,120
I will not back down.

215
00:22:12,120 --> 00:22:15,620
What happened to the Shen family will not happen again.

216
00:22:19,460 --> 00:22:24,700
I, Yan Xing, must enter the palace to seek justice from the Grand Empress Dowager.

217
00:22:30,480 --> 00:22:33,360
- Remember to leave the gate open for me. 
 - Yes.

218
00:22:41,360 --> 00:22:44,720
 Madam, take care. 

219
00:23:00,460 --> 00:23:02,880
Yan Xing, be smart. Don't go any further.

220
00:23:02,880 --> 00:23:04,600
What if I don't?

221
00:23:04,600 --> 00:23:08,160
Do you want to continue assassinating court officials in the street?

222
00:23:08,160 --> 00:23:10,580
Is there no law?

223
00:23:18,220 --> 00:23:20,104
Are you all right?

224
00:23:21,900 --> 00:23:24,580
Sixth Miss, go and do what you want to do.

225
00:23:24,580 --> 00:23:25,840
Sxith Miss Yan, you fool!

226
00:23:25,840 --> 00:23:27,380
If you want to save your man, hurry!

227
00:23:27,380 --> 00:23:28,640
Thank you.

228
00:23:28,640 --> 00:23:30,168
Let's go.

229
00:23:37,040 --> 00:23:38,000
   

230
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:42,680
I'm Yan Xing, Chief Director of the Ministry of Justice.

231
00:23:42,680 --> 00:23:45,120
I hereby accuse the treacherous Minister Lai

232
00:23:45,120 --> 00:23:48,660
of abusing power, distorting the truth,

233
00:23:48,660 --> 00:23:51,640
and wrongfully implicating Shen Du, the Great Chief of the Imperial Guards.

234
00:23:51,640 --> 00:23:56,100
Great Chief Shen Du is so loyal that it can be witnessed by everyone.

235
00:23:56,100 --> 00:24:00,540
Grand Empress Dowager, I beg you to clear Shen Du's name.

236
00:24:10,200 --> 00:24:15,360
I'm Yan Xing, Chief Director of the Ministry of Justice.

237
00:24:15,360 --> 00:24:17,480
I hereby accuse the treacherous Minister Lai

238
00:24:17,480 --> 00:24:21,000
of abusing power and distorting truth.

239
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:26,220
Great Chief Shen Du is so loyal that it can be witnessed by everyone.

240
00:24:26,220 --> 00:24:30,700
- Grand Empress Dowager, I beg you to clear Shen Du's name. 
 - Grand Empress Dowager won't see anyone now.

241
00:24:32,800 --> 00:24:34,520
Go back.

242
00:24:35,785 --> 00:24:38,592
â™«  It's hard to forget the brief encounter we had  â™«

243
00:24:40,060 --> 00:24:41,780
Everything is predetermined.

244
00:24:41,780 --> 00:24:44,160
You're doing it for nothing.

245
00:24:49,960 --> 00:24:55,600
I'm Yan Xing, Chief Director of the Ministry of Justice.

246
00:24:55,600 --> 00:24:58,480
I hereby accuse the treacherous Minister Lai

247
00:24:58,480 --> 00:25:02,900
of abusing power and distorting truth.

248
00:25:06,149 --> 00:25:12,421
â™«  Tossed about by the wind and rain, I will never regret it, 
 I will accompany you for my whole life  â™«

249
00:25:12,421 --> 00:25:18,729
â™«  At least you share my joy and sorrow  â™«

250
00:25:18,729 --> 00:25:25,108
â™«  Unravelling fate, fearlessly, a dream returns  â™«

251
00:25:25,108 --> 00:25:30,200
â™«  The mountains and rivers are bright and beautiful, 
 holding hands, together we return  â™«

252
00:25:30,200 --> 00:25:32,740
Grand Empress Dowager,

253
00:25:33,440 --> 00:25:36,240
I beg you to clear Shen Du's name.

254
00:25:55,000 --> 00:25:59,140
Marshal Xu, do you think I am acting like a heroine?

255
00:26:00,080 --> 00:26:03,200
Yes, of course.

256
00:26:03,200 --> 00:26:05,200
What are you laughing at?

257
00:26:05,200 --> 00:26:10,120
I'm thinking about why a girl like you wants to be a heroine.

258
00:26:10,880 --> 00:26:15,500
Because only a heroine can match a great hero.

259
00:26:23,840 --> 00:26:27,060
Right! How is your dowry coming along?

260
00:26:27,940 --> 00:26:29,800
You've been the Marshal of Inspectors for years.

261
00:26:29,800 --> 00:26:32,800
You must have saved up some possessions.

262
00:26:35,740 --> 00:26:37,360
Wait until this is over,

263
00:26:37,360 --> 00:26:39,740
I will definitely hold a grand wedding for you,

264
00:26:39,740 --> 00:26:42,180
and ask all the inspectors to come and celebrate us.

265
00:26:42,180 --> 00:26:43,900
You'll marry off with glory and honor.

266
00:26:43,900 --> 00:26:46,280
- Really? 
 - Of course.

267
00:26:55,040 --> 00:26:56,860
It's the distress fireworks of inspectors.

268
00:26:56,860 --> 00:26:58,600
Outside the city.

269
00:27:50,460 --> 00:27:51,820
Marshal Xu.

270
00:27:51,820 --> 00:27:53,380
Don't be scared.

271
00:28:00,300 --> 00:28:01,680
You minions!

272
00:28:01,680 --> 00:28:03,780
- Don't try to harmâ€¦ 
 - Yun Que.

273
00:28:05,160 --> 00:28:07,060
Listen to me. Run.

274
00:28:07,060 --> 00:28:08,380
Run?

275
00:28:08,380 --> 00:28:10,400
Yes. Go back to the city and look for Jiang Langxing,

276
00:28:10,400 --> 00:28:12,320
ask him to take inspectors out of the city to provide support.

277
00:28:12,320 --> 00:28:15,200
This is an order from the Marshal of Inspectors.

278
00:28:15,200 --> 00:28:17,072
You must obey it.

279
00:28:18,340 --> 00:28:19,972
Yes.

280
00:28:57,640 --> 00:29:00,620
 No. Brother Xu didn't actually want me to find support. 

281
00:29:00,620 --> 00:29:02,900
 He knew it was too late. 

282
00:29:08,980 --> 00:29:11,560
 He wanted to cover for my escape alone. 

283
00:29:36,480 --> 00:29:38,480
Brother Xu!

284
00:30:16,640 --> 00:30:18,588
Yun Que.

285
00:30:22,040 --> 00:30:24,340
The grand wedding...

286
00:30:25,760 --> 00:30:29,160
I promised you...

287
00:30:29,820 --> 00:30:34,000
might be gone.

288
00:30:35,220 --> 00:30:37,100
What do you call me?

289
00:30:48,694 --> 00:30:54,680
â™«  May you also look up to see the brilliant stars and moon  â™«

290
00:30:54,680 --> 00:30:56,516
My...

291
00:30:58,922 --> 00:31:03,180
â™«  Among countless others, I've found only you  â™«

292
00:31:03,180 --> 00:31:05,164
...wife.

293
00:31:06,978 --> 00:31:11,452
â™«  Time is fleeting and fate is shallow  â™«

294
00:31:11,452 --> 00:31:17,092
â™«  The winter in warm memories  â™«

295
00:31:17,092 --> 00:31:21,048
â™«  Never mind the destined solitary fate  â™«

296
00:31:21,048 --> 00:31:25,859
â™«  Blazing a lifetime of magnificence  â™«

297
00:31:27,350 --> 00:31:31,707
â™«  I have waited until time bloomed into flowers  â™«

298
00:31:31,707 --> 00:31:37,334
â™«  The ice and snow slowly melting  â™«

299
00:31:37,334 --> 00:31:41,740
â™«  I hear those gentle words  â™«

300
00:31:41,740 --> 00:31:47,360
 â™ª My husband and I return together â™ª  
 â™«  He said he loves her  â™«

301
00:31:47,360 --> 00:31:51,770
 â™ª My husband and I return together â™ª  
 â™«  The flower in the mirror, the moon in the water, present in my dreams 

302
00:31:51,770 --> 00:31:57,120
 â™ª The couple goes back home â™ª  
 â™«  Itâ€™s not illusory glamor  â™«

303
00:31:57,120 --> 00:31:59,816
â™«  Why fear the flying sand on the road ahead  â™«

304
00:31:59,816 --> 00:32:02,644
â™«  Chasing time, riding a white horse  â™«

305
00:32:02,644 --> 00:32:07,250
â™«  Let's go together  â™«

306
00:32:07,250 --> 00:32:09,822
â™«  Love is pure and originally flawless  â™«

307
00:32:09,822 --> 00:32:12,650
â™«  Let the vast universe change  â™«

308
00:32:12,650 --> 00:32:17,447
â™«  Let's spend our time together  â™«

309
00:32:21,800 --> 00:32:23,500
Good.

310
00:32:24,400 --> 00:32:28,800
The great power in the imperial court is all in my control.

311
00:32:28,800 --> 00:32:35,100
Only these ignorant inspectors are out of my control.

312
00:32:35,100 --> 00:32:37,500
Those remaining weak scholars

313
00:32:37,500 --> 00:32:40,800
are even easier to handle.

314
00:32:40,800 --> 00:32:42,800
Now the inspectors have lost their marshal,

315
00:32:42,800 --> 00:32:46,000
naturally, they be able to achieve anything.

316
00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:48,800
The Marshal of Inspectors is dead.

317
00:32:48,800 --> 00:32:54,900
Great Chief of the Imperial Guards should face reality now.

318
00:33:13,400 --> 00:33:15,100
Why bring me here?

319
00:33:15,100 --> 00:33:17,000
On such a winter night,

320
00:33:17,000 --> 00:33:22,000
I want to bring you here to appreciate the special scenery.

321
00:34:57,000 --> 00:34:58,500
If I didn't know

322
00:34:58,500 --> 00:35:02,500
that Sixth Miss Yan was a spy sent by Prime Minister Zhang,

323
00:35:02,500 --> 00:35:07,700
I might have been moved by your deep marital affection.

324
00:35:09,000 --> 00:35:10,900
Today, your wife

325
00:35:10,900 --> 00:35:14,400
has bravely stormed the palace gate today,

326
00:35:14,400 --> 00:35:18,400
kneeling for an entire day in the heavy snow.

327
00:35:22,700 --> 00:35:25,600
Vice Minister Lai, you brought me here in the dead of night.

328
00:35:28,600 --> 00:35:31,800
You aren't just keeping me company to see my wife, right?

329
00:35:31,800 --> 00:35:34,400
I am jealous of you.

330
00:35:34,400 --> 00:35:38,200
Why are there always so many people willing to fight for you?

331
00:35:42,300 --> 00:35:45,000
Perhaps you still don't know.

332
00:35:45,000 --> 00:35:47,100
To protect your wife from entering the palace,

333
00:35:47,100 --> 00:35:51,900
Marshal of Inspectors and his woman even sacrificed their lives.

334
00:35:53,900 --> 00:35:57,800
What a tragedy.

335
00:36:01,500 --> 00:36:03,200
Great Chief Shen,

336
00:36:04,120 --> 00:36:06,800
over these days,

337
00:36:06,800 --> 00:36:10,100
I think you must have understood

338
00:36:10,100 --> 00:36:14,300
how the world will be like in the future.

339
00:36:18,700 --> 00:36:21,100
Great Chief Shen, do you still remember it?

340
00:36:21,100 --> 00:36:24,400
When I gave you the bottle of the heart blood,

341
00:36:25,960 --> 00:36:29,100
you once promised me something.

342
00:36:38,000 --> 00:36:41,100
Whether you are sincere or not,

343
00:36:41,100 --> 00:36:44,400
I need you to stand by my side.

344
00:36:46,100 --> 00:36:48,700
- Of course. 
 - That's good then.

345
00:36:48,700 --> 00:36:55,400
I have always believed you were a man of his word.

346
00:37:38,700 --> 00:37:40,600
Madam.

347
00:37:43,120 --> 00:37:45,680
It snowed a bit.

348
00:37:46,900 --> 00:37:48,710
It's just a pity...

349
00:37:49,760 --> 00:37:52,800
that today I couldn't meet the Grand Empress Dowager.

350
00:37:55,900 --> 00:37:59,600
Tomorrow, I will go again.

351
00:38:15,500 --> 00:38:17,300
Shen Du.

352
00:38:26,500 --> 00:38:27,900
You're back.

353
00:38:27,900 --> 00:38:30,700
Did the Empress Dowager release you?

354
00:38:32,400 --> 00:38:34,600
It is Vice Minister Lai.

355
00:38:39,000 --> 00:38:41,000
Vice Minister Lai?

356
00:38:41,800 --> 00:38:44,600
Lai Luozhi released you?

357
00:38:45,500 --> 00:38:47,900
He surprisingly had a change of heart.

358
00:38:49,200 --> 00:38:52,400
What happened to your face? Let me see.

359
00:39:12,600 --> 00:39:16,200
Husband, what's wrong?

360
00:39:17,000 --> 00:39:18,800
Yan Xing,

361
00:39:20,100 --> 00:39:22,200
let's divorce.

362
00:39:31,240 --> 00:39:33,360
What did you say?

363
00:39:35,600 --> 00:39:37,500
You and I...

364
00:39:38,700 --> 00:39:40,500
get a divorce.

365
00:39:43,500 --> 00:39:45,400
Divorce?

366
00:39:46,700 --> 00:39:48,500
Why?

367
00:39:51,100 --> 00:39:54,100
Have you encountered any danger?

368
00:39:54,100 --> 00:39:57,200
Did Lai Luozhi threaten you?

369
00:39:59,840 --> 00:40:02,320
What happened?

370
00:40:07,800 --> 00:40:10,100
Shen Du, did you forget?

371
00:40:11,000 --> 00:40:13,300
I am Sixth Miss Yan.

372
00:40:15,500 --> 00:40:18,700
I am the Chief Director of the Ministry of Justice.

373
00:40:18,700 --> 00:40:20,900
Although my rank is not high,

374
00:40:20,900 --> 00:40:24,700
I am a female court official and have also handled many major cases.

375
00:40:26,900 --> 00:40:31,900
I've never been someone who needs protection from my husband.

376
00:40:31,900 --> 00:40:34,100
I can stand by your side

377
00:40:34,100 --> 00:40:37,600
and face the challenges with you.

378
00:40:39,200 --> 00:40:42,100
I am not afraid of trouble or difficulties.

379
00:40:42,100 --> 00:40:46,600
No matter what happens, I can face it all with you.

380
00:40:53,240 --> 00:40:56,200
Are you afraid of implicating the Yan family?

381
00:40:58,000 --> 00:40:59,600
Shen Du,

382
00:41:00,700 --> 00:41:04,100
if Lai Luozhi wants to lay his hand on us,

383
00:41:04,100 --> 00:41:06,000
even if you and I get a divorce

384
00:41:06,000 --> 00:41:08,800
he will not let the Yan family go.

385
00:41:09,500 --> 00:41:12,400
If we want to protect them,

386
00:41:12,400 --> 00:41:14,500
we can think of a solution together.

387
00:41:14,500 --> 00:41:15,950
Like,

388
00:41:16,850 --> 00:41:19,100
sending the Yan family away from Xiang'an.

389
00:41:19,100 --> 00:41:20,800
Andâ€¦

390
00:41:24,200 --> 00:41:26,200
Sixth Miss Yan.

391
00:41:29,100 --> 00:41:31,100
It's not because of the Yan family.

392
00:41:31,920 --> 00:41:34,280
Nor is anyone threatening me.

393
00:41:34,280 --> 00:41:36,600
Actually, it is very simple.

394
00:41:37,600 --> 00:41:40,200
After experiencing this period of time,

395
00:41:40,200 --> 00:41:42,500
I've figured it out.

396
00:41:42,500 --> 00:41:46,650
The Shen family needs a wife who is educated and well-mannered,

397
00:41:47,400 --> 00:41:49,900
and is able to support her husband and teach her children.

398
00:41:51,400 --> 00:41:55,600
You cannot provide me with a worry-free household.

399
00:41:55,600 --> 00:41:57,700
Nor do you prioritize me.

400
00:41:57,700 --> 00:42:01,300
You're always trying to win and show off.

401
00:42:02,600 --> 00:42:06,200
You're not a good partner for me.

402
